                              <span>Is there something among advanced Linux users that when you have already reached quite a high level of enlightenment, when you understand the whole essence of this life, then you no longer lean out, but just sit silently enjoy your favorite activities as well as your superiority over those who still wallowing in shit there, a few levels below. 
 Speaking in general how do you think, if there is some kind of spiritual enlightenment in a person who becomes a complete Linuxoid?

                              <span>When compiling code to a statically linked ELF we bake all the code our binary needs from shared libraries inside our own executable (https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/openxl-c-and-cpp-aix/17.1.0?topic&#x3D;cc-dynamic-static-linking). The question which arises is how and if it effects the ASLR (https://medium.com/@boutnaru/security-aslr-address-space-layout-randomization-part-1-overview-3aec7fec01e0) posture of the process executing the statically linked binary?
 Thus, as we can see in the screenshot below when linking the binary statically (using “-static”) any time we execute it the addresses of the stack/heap/vdso/vvar memory regions are randomized. However, the memory regions mapped from the binary are not randomized.
 In order to fix this we can use “-static-pie” which can load the memory regions mapped for the statically linked binary to randomized addresses without the need of the dynamic linker (https://patchwork.ozlabs.org/project/gcc/patch/20170808221841.GA16793@gmail.com/#1758721). We can see that in the screenshot below.

                              <span>Hello I&#x27;m trying to understand how the Linux NAPI works. Here is a description of what i have gathered from the internet:
 Linux NAPI combines interrupts and polling. The network interfaces generate an interrupt when the first packet arrives and register themselves in a work list. All subsequent interrupts are blocked by the interface. Each interface has a DMA ring into which packets are copied by the network driver. When a DMA ring is full, all further incoming packets are dropped. Later on, a software interrupt request is activated, and the devices in the work list are polled. After a certain number of polled packets (quota), the device is placed back at the end of the work list if it still has more packets to process. Otherwise, it is removed from the work list and allowed to generate an interrupt again.
 Is this correct? Would you add something?

                              <span>I&#x27;m going to start a business to promote, develop, and distribute technologies for data privacy. The biggest part of this I think is promoting desktop/mobile Linux operating systems.
 I&#x27;m planning to develop an application for Linux desktop as the first product. I have a few ideas, but I&#x27;m looking for the path of least resistance just to have a first product and I&#x27;ll branch out from there. I have some code written for a parental control suite, but that&#x27;s still months from beta testing. I could continue working on that, and I will at some point, but I&#x27;d like to get something out at least by the end of the year. What do you think I should develop first?

                              <span>Howdy! RSSfeedASAP scratches my own itch. I run a regional podcasting directory which gets dozens of messy submission for podcasts. Often they don&#x27;t even include an xml file and me being a good samaritan I sometimes do the manual work and find it myself. I got tired of that manual work and decided to build a microapp.
RSSfeedASAP is this app and I decided to release it in case someone else finds any use in it.

                              <span>已停止支持的 OS/2 Warp 的继任者 ArcaOS 发布新版本

IBM 于 2006 年底停止了对 OS/2 的支持，但许多公司和个人仍在使用 OS/2 及其衍生系统 eComStation。2014 年 7 月，当时几位曾参与 eComStation 项目的开发人员推出 ArcaOS。经过多年的开发，ArcaOS 发布了最新版本 5.1.0。它兼容 UEFI，可在现代 x86 硬件上运行，还能安装到基于 GPT 的磁盘布局中。需要说明的是，ArcaOS 是付费软件，个人许可证为 139 美元。

老王点评：没想到，已经停止支持十多年的 OS/2 居然还有人坚持使用它的衍生版。




人工智能热让安圭拉的 .ai 域名成为数字金矿

加勒比海上的英属小岛安圭拉今年可能会凭借其 .ai 域名带来高达 3000 万美元的收入。这听起来并不算多，但安圭拉的土地总面积只有 35 平方英里，人口只有 1.5 万人，这占到了其国内生产总值的 10%。1985 年，各国首次获得了自己国家代码顶级域名。1995 年以来，安圭拉分配到了 .ai 域名，安圭拉在 2021 年从 .ai 域名注册中仅获得了 740 万美元的收入。

老王点评：这对于这个小岛真是飞来横财啊，感谢 ChatGPT，感谢 OpenAI。😉




由于 2038 年问题，Debian 放弃 32 位 MIPS 小端架构

Debian 12 是最后一个支持 MIPS 小端架构（MIPSEL）的版本。MIPSEL 现已从 Debian 不稳定版/实验版中移除。MIPSEL 曾是 Debian 中最古老的架构之一，仅次于 i386 和 AMD64。Debian 放弃 MIPSEL 架构的理由是，其 “2038 年问题” 尚未解决、2G 用户空间内存限制，以及 Debian 开发人员缺乏维护该架构的人力。因此，MIPSEL 将从 Debian 官方发布的架构中删除，而 MIPS64EL 作为 64 位小端变体将继续保留。


消息来源：Phoronix



老王点评：看来 2038 问题真不是个问题，根本等不到 2038 年，有的架构就被淘汰了。</span>

                              <span>考虑到它已经如此之老，它的活力令人惊讶。




USENET 管理委员会已经重新召开，这个早于万维网的原创社交网络上出现了增长的新苗头。

USENET（或 NetNews）是一个纯文本的社交讨论平台，或者说，是一系列的被称为“新闻组newsgroup”的讨论组，这些讨论组部署在遍布世界各地的服务器上。虽然其原始开发者在 2010 年 关闭 了他们的服务器，但那只是几百个服务器中的一个，在全球范围内，还有许多服务器运行得很好。USENET 并没有消失，它仍然活着，你可以免费加入，而且大多数操作系统都有协助你使用它的各种客户端应用程序。

尽管 USENET 是去中心化的 P2P 网络，但 Big-8 理事会仍是其最接近中央的管理机构。理事会成员 Tristan Miller 说：“我和 Jason Evans 在 2020 年 重建 了这个理事会，此后，Rayner Lucas 几个月后加入了我们。”

包括其他事项在内，理事会开始重新管理新闻组列表。他们应版主的要求删除了一些过时的群组，并添加了多年来的首个新新闻组，这是一个用于 Gemini 协议 的新闻组。如果你有新闻客户端，你应该可以打开 news:comp.infosystems.gemini。此外，理事会也对网站进行了全新改版，举办了 Reddit AMA（在线问我任何事）活动，更新了版主所用的 GNU Stump 和 WebStump 软件包等。

USENET 比万维网更早，并且它运行的方式更类似与电子邮件：服务器会保存一份新闻组列表，并与其他服务器同步信息。

（USENET 之所以走向衰败，其原因之一是人们发现了如何发布二进制文件的方式 —— 将其编码为多段的 ASCII 文本。它仍然存在 盗版问题，但你可以选择忽略。这也是互联网历史上 首次出现垃圾信息 的地方。）

连上 USENET 其实非常简单。你只需在 USENET 服务器上创建一个账户，安装一个客户端并告知它服务器地址。下载群组列表，选择订阅一些群组，新的消息便会传递到你的客户端，就这么简单。

The Register 的 FOSS 部门使用的是一个名为 “Eternal September” 的服务器，该名字源自当年 AOL 向其互联网客户端引入 USENET 访问功能，导致大量的网络新手涌入但不了解其规则的 事件。这里我们可以给出一条建议：请严格遵循 纯文本、底部回复 的电子邮件“网络礼仪”。

“Eternal September” 只有文本新闻组，不接受二进制文件，但它提供完全免费的账户。而另一些大容量的服务器如 Eweka、Giganews 等则会收取访问费。

至于客户端 —— 如我们在新的 Thunderbird ESR 版本的介绍中所提到的，我们选用了 Thunderbird。它是免费的，易用，并能运行在所有主流的桌面操作系统上。当然，市面上还有许多其他的客户端可供选择。甚至 谷歌的网上论坛 都还在运营，尽管显得有些被忽视。

作为一位重度科幻读者，我乐于深入研究 rec.arts.sf.written 和 rec.arts.sf.fandom 等群组。计算机历史群组 alt.folklore.computers 依然活跃。在一些复古计算频道中依然充满生机，我们也在这些频道中愉快地讨论了 Acorn RISC OS 和 Fortran 等诸多主题。

                              <span>对于某些需求，你可能需要找到映射到逻辑单元号（LUN）和文件系统（FS）的块设备，以进行文件系统扩展或灾难恢复（DR）活动。

当你管理更大的基础设施时，类似的活动可能会经常发生。假设有超过 1000 台服务器托管各种应用。

参考以下类似文章：


如何在 Linux 中查找 SAN 磁盘 LUN

如何在 Linux 中将 ASM 磁盘映射到物理磁盘


在本文中，我们将向你展示如何在 Linux 中映射物理磁盘、存储 LUN 和文件系统（FS）。

将物理磁盘映射到 Linux 中的存储 LUN 和文件系统的 Shell 脚本

这个小 shell 脚本可帮助你识别哪些 SAN 磁盘映射到 Linux 上的哪些块设备和文件系统。

vi block_device_mapping_with_LUN_FS.sh


#!/bin/bash
for lunmap in &#x60;lsblk | grep disk | grep ^s | awk &#x27;{print $1}&#x27;&#x60;
do
for mpoint in &#x60;lsblk /dev/$lunmpa | grep lvm | awk &#x27;{print $NF}&#x27;&#x60;
do
echo &quot;$lunmap --&gt; $mpoint --&gt; $(smartctl -a /dev/$lunmap | grep &quot;Logical Unit id&quot; | awk -F&quot;:&quot; &#x27;{print $2}&#x27;)&quot;
done
done


设置 block_device_mapping_with_LUN_FS.sh 文件的可执行权限。

chmod +x block_device_mapping_with_LUN_FS.sh


最后运行脚本查看结果。

sh block_device_mapping_with_LUN_FS.sh




注意： 在上面的输出中，设备 sda 不会显示任何 LUN 信息，因为它是从 VMWare 端添加的虚拟磁盘，没有任何 LUN。其他 3 个磁盘是从存储映射的，这就是我们能够看到 LUN 信息的原因。

如果你想即时运行该脚本，请使用下面的一行脚本。

for lunmap in &#x60;lsblk | grep disk | grep ^s | awk &#x27;{print $1}&#x27;&#x60;; do 
    for mpoint in &#x60;lsblk /dev/$lunmpa | grep lvm | awk &#x27;{print $NF}&#x27;&#x60;; do 
        echo &quot;$lunmap --&gt; $mpoint --&gt; $(smartctl -a /dev/$lunmap | grep &quot;Logical Unit id&quot; | awk -F&quot;:&quot; &#x27;{print $2}&#x27;)&quot;
    done
done


sda --&gt; /
sda --&gt; /usr
sda --&gt; /opt
sda --&gt; /tmp
sda --&gt; /var
sda --&gt; /home
sdb --&gt; /data --&gt;      0x3600d0230000000000e1140463955737c
sdc --&gt; /app --&gt;      0x3600d0230000000000e114046395577cd
sdd --&gt; /backup --&gt;      0x3600d0230000000000e11404639558cc5


总结

在本教程中，我们向你展示了如何在 Linux 上检查 SAN 提供的 LUN 以及底层操作系统磁盘和关联的文件系统。

                              <span>法国插画家古斯塔夫·多雷所绘《穿靴子的猫》

1931年3月5日的《申报》刊登了时任湖南省政府主席何键撰写的一篇《咨请教部改良学校课程》，文中气势汹汹地斥责道，“近日课本，每每‘狗说’‘猪说’‘鸭子说’，以及‘猫小姐’‘狗大哥’‘牛公公’之词，充溢行间，禽兽能作人言，尊称加诸兽类，鄙俚怪诞，莫可言状”，随即忧心忡忡地慨叹，“倘再过数十年，人之将亡，滔滔皆可率兽食人，人将相食”，“窃虑其必有无量无边之浩劫也”。他由此强烈建议，这样的课本“不切日用，切宜焚毁”，决不能予以宽宥纵容。没过多久，曾赴美攻读心理学和教育学，回国后在中央大学任教的尚仲衣，出席中华儿童教育社第二届年会并发表演讲。在稍后披露的演讲稿《选择儿童读物的标准》（载《儿童教育》第三卷第八期，1931年）中，他强调在编写和选择儿童读物时应该尽量恪守“合乎事实不违反自然现象”的原则，“鸟兽本不能作人言，如读物中使鸟兽作人言，即是越乎自然”，还举出“儿童在读物中看到猫会讲人话”等作为例证，认为如果出现类似的情况，“未始不是教育中的倒行逆施”。何、尚二人所言桴鼓相应，尽管都没有指名道姓，却很容易令人联想到此前流行的一篇汉译童话中的主人公——穿靴子的猫。

何键《咨请教部改良学校课程》

一、从翻译到改编
有关“穿靴子的猫”的民间故事在欧洲各地流传极广，还相继衍生出各种不同形式的文艺作品：德国剧作家路德维希·蒂克（Ludwig Tieck）以此为题材创作过一部三幕童话剧，德国语言学家格林兄弟（Brüder Grimm）编纂的《儿童与家庭故事集》初版第一卷中也收录过这个故事，最脍炙人口的则莫过于法国作家夏尔·佩罗（Charles Perrault）在编撰《鹅妈妈的故事》时所整理改编的版本——英国民俗学家安德鲁·朗格（Andrew Lang）蒐求遴选世界各地的传说和故事，汇辑为《朗格童话》，就将这个佩罗版童话稍加润饰收入其中。

现任教于加拿大维多利亚大学的陈忠平教授曾在南京大学取得学士、硕士学位，于上世纪九十年代赴美留学获得博士学位。在美留学期间，他将研究视角从明清江南市镇转向中国近代商会，2011年斯坦福大学出版社出版了在其博士论文基础上形成的专著——Modern China&#x27;s Network Revolution: Chambers of Commerce and Sociopolitical Change in the Early Twentieth Century，近期江苏人民出版社推出了此书的中译本《商会与近代中国的社团网络革命》。近期，陈忠平在接受《上海书评》采访时谈了清末商会的起源，以及商会这一“革命性”组织在中国近代史上的历史意义。

《商会与近代中国的社团网络革命》

中国历史学家对近代商会、商团的研究似乎是从1980年代初开始的，这与那时国家对经济的控制比之前大幅度放松有关。具体到个人，我知道您的博士论文就是围绕商人、商会展开的，您是什么时候对商人这一群体产生兴趣的？
陈忠平：我很早就对商人研究感兴趣，我是南京大学历史系1977届的本科生、1982-1984年间的硕士生，当时的研究方向是明清经济史，就涉及商人。只是国内的明清经济史研究的时段到鸦片战争为止，而不到清末，所以我在国内基本上研究的就是鸦片战争以前的江南地区的社会经济史，也包括商人，写过一些商人的文章，比如徽商，还有广东、福建商人的活动。
这本书跟我在国内做的研究有很大不同：第一，它不是国内学者所研究的明清经济史，它在国内史学界属于近代史；第二，国内的历史学界主要是做实证研究，就是搜集、研究原始资料，而这本书很大程度上关注的是一个理论问题，就是在近代中国商会怎么形成网络，又怎么带动其他社团网络发展，造成了一种革命性的变化。这涉及了整个中国。
中国史学传统与西方史学研究之间有一个很大区别，这也是我…</span>

                              <span>This is a side project I&#x27;ve been working on for the last few months. I built an automated system to continuously mirror all the code on PyPI to a series of Github repositories. Mirroring PyPI code to Github enables:
1. Scanning of all new Python packages for accidentally published credentials
2. A browsable/searchable index of published code with a nice UI
3. Large-scale analysis of all published code to see how the language is evolving
Using this project anyone is able to download the contents of PyPI to their personal machine and analyse every piece of code ever published in a matter of hours.
I hope it enables people to do things with the worlds largest and oldest corpus of Python code that wasn&#x27;t possible before, and while this is likely totally useless to most people I think that is kind of cool and unique.

                              <span>XRss is a simple RSS reader web app built to showcase xtemplate, a new web development tool based on Go&#x27;s html/template and Caddy server.
The entire site UI for XRss comes from a single HTML template file. This index.html includes everything from SQL queries and route definitions and handlers to htmx state transition attributes and tailwindcss classes, and developing it requires zero build steps (amortized).
Check out the source which manages to be at once banal and gnarly: https://github.com/infogulch/xrss/blob/master/templates/inde...
xtemplate preloads the whole template structure into memory and builds the router at startup, so responses to matching requests are rendered after a single lookup. Combined with direct queries to sqlite makes for a very snappy experience typically responding in less than 5ms. (Fingers crossed.)
There are various places where XRss could be improved (PRs welcome!), but it already delivers on its purpose of demonstrating the plausibility of xtemplate. See the xtemplate readme for an overview of what you can do with it. I think of it as &#x27;PHP but the syntax looks like Go templates&#x27;.
https://github.com/infogulch/caddy-xtemplate
Let me know what you think! Does remaking PHP from scratch out of Go templates make me a lunatic? (yes) Is it a good idea anyway? (yes) What kind of web application do you think would be a good fit for a platform like this?

Yes, I&#x27;m ignoring significant privacy issues. 
 
I&#x27;m ignoring ethics. 
 
I&#x27;m ignoring political ramifications. 
 
 I&#x27;m just a person who wants to turn on a computer, get work done and then go do something fun. I don&#x27;t want to pay for software. I don&#x27;t want to deal with problems or spend time fighting software to do basic functions. But I am also a lifetime Linux user and usually a pretty vocal FOSS advocate. 
 Don&#x27;t laugh until you try it, but I think Edge is a serious contender in the browser wars as far as usability goes. Firefox has declined. Brave is just Chromium with crypto-bloat.

                              <span>这是终端用户需要知道的所有关于虚拟机的信息，包括它的工作方式及其必要性。


虚拟机（VM）是一个模拟版的物理计算机，它在虚拟环境中模拟各种功能并分配资源。

简言之，你可以在你当前的操作系统中运行另一个操作系统，就像运行媒体播放器或网络浏览器一样。



你可以在 VM 中执行与裸机（例如你的笔记本电脑或个人电脑）相同的操作，例如连接到网络、下载软件、更新操作系统等等。

当然，根据使用场景，VM 的体验可能会与实体计算机有所不同。

让我们来探索虚拟机，它们的应用场景，以及它们的工作原理。

虚拟机：起源



虚拟机是最重要的基于软件的创新之一。它的起源可以追溯到 1966 年的 IBM CP-40 和 CP-67 虚拟机操作系统，那时候人们在研究和测试虚拟内存和资源的概念。

快进到我们发表此文的 2023 年，虚拟机已经无处不在，涵盖从个人电脑，到大型企业，再到小型企业。每个人以某种或其他方式都在使用虚拟机。

考虑到所有这些，显然，虚拟机非常有用。但是，它是如何工作的，我们具体用它来做什么？


💡


裸机 &#x3D; 实体的物理电脑，例如你的 PC 或笔记本电脑

宿主操作系统 &#x3D; 安装在你实体电脑上的操作系统

客户操作系统 &#x3D; 在虚拟机内运行的操作系统

虚拟机（VM）&#x3D; 是虚拟化应用的通用术语



虚拟机如何运作



理解虚拟化的概念会有助于你弄清楚虚拟机是如何运作的。

回顾我们在一篇文章中的描述：


“虚拟化为你提供了计算机硬件的抽象概念，以便你创建虚拟机（VM）、网络、存储等。”


虚拟化允许用户在虚拟环境中利用物理系统的资源。这使得一个进程可以单独地使用资源，而不会影响物理计算机。

而虚拟机就是运用这一能力的过程，在此你会得到以虚拟磁盘、内存，及其他配置文件形式的虚拟资源，让你能在…</span>

随着开发中的 Linux 6.6 内核增加了对更多即将推出的 Radeon 图形处理器的支持，现在内核中 AMD GPU 驱动代码的行数已超过 500 万行。其中很大一部分是 AMD 在每一代新版本中不断引入的新的自动生成的头文件，这些冗长的头文件就像是 AMD 为其 GPU 创建详尽的公共文档一样。与此同时，整个 Linux 内核源代码树现在大约有 3480 万行，这包括文档、各种树内实用程序/工具、其他辅助工具等。作为对比，英伟达的开源 Nouveau 驱动程序仅有大约 20 万行。

老王点评：相比 Linus 曾经对英伟达的愤怒，AMD 倒是大量往内核提交代码，可是这样往内核中“灌水”真的好吗？




ReiserFS 被正式标记为“过时”

ReiserFS 曾是二十多年前 Linux 引入的第一个日志文件系统，在 2006 年前 SUSE Linux 发行版一直将其作为默认文件系统。但自从 ReiserFS 作者 Hans Reiser 因谋杀罪被判刑之后，该文件系统的开发就几乎停滞了。内核开发者去年开始讨论 废弃 ReiserFS 文件系统，并在 Linux 5.18 中将其标记为废弃，openSUSE 也结束了对 ReiserFS 的支持。在 Linux 6.6 中，ReiserFS 不再被标记为“支持”，而是被正式标记为“过时”，将在未来几年来从主线内核中移除。

老王点评：很可惜，但更令人遗憾的是，在主要开发者入狱后，因为没有人和公司愿意继续参与一个有污点的人开创的项目，而导致项目消亡。




Visual Studio for Mac：从开源到闭源，到废弃

微软正在停止 Visual Studio for Mac（VS Mac）的开发，将于 2024 年结束支持。VS Mac 是作为 Windows 版 Visual Studio 的 Mac 版本推出的，但该产品的起源不同，其功能也从未接近 Windows 版的同类产品。它主要是一个 .NET 集成开发环境，不支持 C/C++。它始于 2000 年 SharpDevelop，它是一个 C# 的开源集成开发环境。然后它分叉成为 Linux 上的 MonoDevelop，并被 Xamarin 接管成为 Xamarin Studio，在 2016 年随同 Xamarin 被微软收购。微软将其重新命名为 Visual Studio for Mac，并关闭了源代码。随后几年，直到被废弃前，它的开发几乎停滞不前。幸运的是，MonoDevelop 还有一个开源的复刻 DotDevelop 正在持续开发当中。


消息来源：Dev Class



老王点评：微软发现 VS Code 更好时，这种边缘项目自然就废弃了。不知道会不会有一天微软将 Visual Studio 也废弃了，只保留下 VS Code 呢？</span>

                              <span>对于不想在桌面上看到主文件夹图标的 Ubuntu 用户，这里有一个简单技巧。


Ubuntu 使用定制的 GNOME 版本，由于侧边启动器，它的外观与旧的 Unity 桌面有些相似。

普通 GNOME 和 Ubuntu 的 GNOME 之间的另一个区别是桌面上主文件夹和回收站的使用。这些图标就在那里，以便你可以快速访问它们。



如果你觉得不美观，可以从桌面视图中删除主文件夹。

让我分享一下 GUI 和命令行方法。

在 Ubuntu 中隐藏桌面上的主文件夹图标

你只需要这样做：

在 Ubuntu 中按 Super + D 键盘快捷键访问桌面。

现在右键单击桌面上的空白区域。

从右键单击上下文菜单中，选择桌面图标设置Desktop Icons Settings。



它将在“设置Settings”应用中打开 Ubuntu 桌面Ubuntu Desktop设置选项。你也可以通过打开“设置”应用并转到侧边栏中的“Ubuntu 桌面”选项来访问它。

在这里，你将看到**显示个人文件夹Show Personal folder的切换选项**。将其关闭以禁用桌面上的主文件夹图标。




💡 想要恢复主文件夹图标吗？ 再次切换它。


使用命令行禁用主文件夹图标

是的，你可以从命令行完全禁用主文件夹图标。

打开终端并使用以下命令。

gsettings set org.gnome.shell.extensions.ding show-home false


效果将是立竿见影的。

要恢复图标，请使用相同的命令，但使用 true 而不是 false：

gsettings set org.gnome.shell.extensions.ding show-home true


看到那有多简单了吗？ 也可以采取类似的步骤来删除回收站图标。


如何在 Ubuntu 中移走桌面的回收站图标

你可以始终期待看到 以 UI 为中心的变化、功能增强，以及核心应用的更新。

GNOME 44 引入了一些有趣的新功能，比如能够检查正在后台运行的应用、在文件选择器中的缩略图视图等等。

GNOME 45 计划于 9 月 20 日 发布，但你已经可以在其 beta 版本中预览到更新的功能集。现在，让我们一起看看在 GNOME 45 中有哪些你可以期待的新内容。

GNOME 45：有哪些新变化？



主要的亮点包括：


新的核心应用

系统设置中的新隐私中心

系统设置中新的“关于About”面板

日历应用的新图标

对 Nautilus 文件管理器 UI 的微调


我将对所有这些改变进行分类，以帮助你更好的理解。那么，让我们立即开始：

Nautilus 的改善



在过去，Nautilus 文件管理器没有进行过任何 UI 调整。但是，在 GNOME 45 中，它做了一些微妙的 UI 改版，在侧边栏中你可以看到汉堡菜单。

总的来说，左侧边栏和窗口的其他部分更具区分度。

你还可以期待其性能提升和搜索功能的改善。

系统设置的变更

自 GNOME 43 和 44 版本起，GNOME 在努力改进并清理系统设置Settings，以便在简化系统设置选项的访问性的同时，简化所有的可用选项。

在这里，“隐私Privacy”菜单已经改版，选项的展示更加有条理且易于访问。



接下来，“关于About”区域也进行了调整，以便通过“系统详细信息System Details”菜单展示技术信息，如下图所示。



你需要点击“系统详细信息”来获取关于操作系统和硬件的所有必要技术信息。

                              <span>子曰：“唯女子与小人为难养也，近之则不孙，远之则怨。”（《论语·阳货·第十七》）这句话里的“女子”和“小人”到底是什么意思？该如何翻译成英语？
朱熹《四书章句集注》解释说：此小人，亦谓仆隶下人也。君子之于臣妾，庄以莅之，慈以蓄之，则无二者之患矣。显然，朱熹是把“女子”解释为妾侍，把“小人”解释为仆隶下人的。
吕思勉先生的《读史札记》第一九八条对“女子”和“小人”做了同样的解释：此所谓女子，乃指女子中之小人言，非谓凡女子也。小人犹言臣，女子犹言妾耳，古臣妾恒并称。吕先生随后分别举了《礼记》《战国策》《国语》中的例子来说明“臣妾并举”乃是古代的普遍现象。照此解释，“女子”似应译为concubine；而“小人”则是servant。
钱穆先生《论语新解》的解释是：此章女子小人指家中仆妾而言。妾视仆尤近，故女子在小人前。因其指仆妾，故称养。待之近，则狎而不逊。远，则怨恨必作。善御仆妾，亦齐家之一事。钱穆先生的“白话试译”是：先生说：“只有家里的妾侍和仆人最难养。你若和他们近了，他将不知有逊让。你若和他们远了，他便会怨恨你。”钱穆先生的解释和上述朱熹和吕思勉的解释几乎完全相同。
杨伯峻先生《论语译注》的译文是：孔子道：“只有女子和小人是难得同他们共处的，亲近了，他会无礼；疏远了，他会怨恨。”杨先生此书流传极广，可惜对两者没有作进一步解释。
李泽厚先生《论语今读》里，“译”：孔子说：“只有妇女和小人难以对付：亲近了，不谦逊；疏远了，又埋怨。”“注”：《朱注》：此小人，亦谓仆隶下人也。“记”：这章最为现代妇女所诟病。好些人写文章来批评，好些人写文章来辩说，其实都不必要。相反，我以为这句话相当准确地描述了妇女性格的某些特征。对她们亲密，她们有时就过分随便，任意笑骂打闹。而稍一疏远，便埋怨不已。这种心理性格特征本身并无所谓好坏，只是由性别差异产生的不同而已；应说它是心理学的某种事实，并不必含褒…</span>

在韩国出生的德国新生代思想家韩炳哲（Byung-Chul Han）被西班牙《国家报》（El País）誉为“德国哲学界的一颗新星”，他的作品被译成十几种语言，据称中译本韩炳哲作品第一辑共九种（中信出版集团，2019年）出版后在中国读者中也产生了较大反响。应该肯定的是，韩炳哲的哲学思考与写作文本贴近数字媒体时代的现实前沿，将哲学的人文传统和批判传统相结合，针对当下世界的精神状况展开论述，因此被称为“互联网时代的精神分析师”“大数据时代的哲学批判指南”。他的很多作品篇幅简短，思想锋利，文字简洁明快，这些特点也使他在网络时代容易受到读者的追捧。在读过他的几本小书之后，我有点担心的是他那些不乏思想性和洞察力的论述会被他一再批判的讨喜点赞型社会点赞成网络心灵鸡汤。但是无论如何，在他作品中一再体现出来的批判性是不会因此而变质的。
韩炳哲的《妥协社会：今日之痛》（原书名Palliativgesellschaft： Schmerz heute）的核心主题是“痛苦”，全书十一章中有八章的题目就是：痛苦恐惧症、痛苦之无意义、痛苦之狡计、痛苦之为真理、痛苦之诗学、痛苦之辩证法、痛苦之存在论、痛苦之伦理学，就连在第二章的题目“幸福强制”之下的第一句话也是“痛苦是一种综合的文化现象，它在社会中的出现和意义也与统治形式息息相关”（第9页）。
那么，究竟作者为什么要如此重视“痛苦”？这是一种无病呻吟吗？关键的问题是看作者从什么角度和如何谈论“痛苦”。全书的第一句话引用了德国著名心理学家、哲学家恩斯特·云格尔的“告诉我你和痛苦的关系，我就会说出你是谁！”，然后他马上就说“这句话完全适用于整个社会。我们与痛苦的关系透露出我们生活在一个怎样的社会。痛苦即密码，它藏有解读当时社会的关键信息。因此，所有社会…</span>

1922年，梁启超在清华大学文学社的活动中进行了题为《中国韵文里头所表现的情感》的讲演，指出“清代大词家固然很多，但头两把交椅，却被前后两位旗人——成容若、郑叔问占去”。他提到的“郑叔问”，就是四年前离世的友人、“晚清四大词人”之一的郑文焯。时至今日，距离梁启超的评论已过去了一百年，较之纳兰性德在词学研究界已有多部词集注本问世（赵秀亭《饮水词校笺》、张草纫《纳兰词笺注》、张秉戍《纳兰词笺注》等），其作品风靡大江南北，被普通读者记诵的程度甚至超过了《花间》等经典，郑文焯在当代的知名度就小得多，缺少像朱祖谋编《宋词三百首》、况周颐著《蕙风词话》那样的“出圈”之作。其词集《樵风乐府》至今尚无校注本，其年谱的编纂工作亦长期无人问津，殊为遗憾。
事实上，在“晚清四大词人”中，朱祖谋、况周颐、王鹏运三人在近年皆有较完整的年谱问世，分别为沈文泉的《朱彊村年谱》（浙江古籍出版社，2013年），郑炜明、陈玉莹的《况周颐年谱》（齐鲁书社，2015年），李保阳的《王鹏运年谱稿》（见氏著《王鹏运词学文献考》，华艺数位股份有限公司，2022年），唯郑文焯的年谱迟迟未有动静。虽然早在九十年前，就有大鹤之婿戴正诚的《郑叔问先生年谱》（《青鹤》杂志，1933年）可资参考，但毕竟年代久远，当时的编纂理念和文献信息，已无法满足二十一世纪的学术需求。南开大学杨传庆先生研究大鹤十数年，早前已出版其博士学位论文《郑文焯词及词学研究》（南开大学出版社，2013年），最近又由中华书局出版所著《郑文焯年谱长编》（以下简称《长编》），洵为大鹤功臣。此书作为当代“晚清四大词人”年谱的收官之作，不仅填补了相关研究领域的空白，还是学界以“长编”体例编纂清代词人年谱的又一次尝试（此前唯有陆有富《文廷式年谱长编》，中华书局，2020年）。在史料考辨…</span>

                              <span>One of the first things I do after installing a Linux distribution, is add to the default /etc/profile (or create and entry in /etc/profile.d/) that exports variables such as XDG[DATA,CONFIG]_DIRS, and XDG[DATA,CONFIG,CACHE,STATE]_HOME to their respective locations, based on the freedesktop.org &#x27;basedir&#x27; specification (as outlined here: https://specifications.freedesktop.org/basedir-spec/latest/ar01s03.html).
 I do this, because after trying many different distributions, I noticed that the output of printenv did not contain these variables.
 As a user, these variables make my experience simpler. I&#x27;m not going to argue that these specifications should be followed by all, because I know there are many users who are committed to dying on the hill that is their cluttered home directory. However, the existence of these variables is not a deterrent to users who do not want to use the specification, as many applications will want to use your home directory anyway. If the existence of these variables made the specification strictly followed, projects like xdg-ninja (https://github.com/b3nj5m1n/xdg-ninja) would have no reason to exist.
 I have seen many... questionable things in various distributions&#x27; /etc/profile&#x27;s, but never once have I seen one that simply exported these variables. Why not?

                              <span>The LFS release includes updates to binutils-2.41, gcc-13.2.0, and glibc-2.38. In total, 38 packages were updated since the last release. The Linux kernel has also been updated to version 6.4.12.
 Other significant changes include:
 - Addition of libxcrypt as a separate package.
 Previously this package was included with glibc.
 - For the sysV version of the book, udev is now extracted directly from the systemd tarball. This change also requires building the Python modules jinja and markupsafe.
 - The new package pkgconf is now used instead of pkg-config because the later packages is no longer maintained.
 - The new Python module flit-core was added as a new required dependency for the wheel module. 
 The BLFS version includes approximately 1000 packages beyond the base Linux From Scratch Version 11.2 book. This release has 1543 updates from the previous BLFS version including package updates and numerous text and formatting changes.
 New in this version of BLFS is the LXQt Desktop Environment and an alternative method of building Qt with lighter dependency requirements than the full Qt package.
 DEPRECATION NOTICE: Future versions of BLFS will remove the unmaintained LXDE Desktop Environment and support for the Reiser file system (reiserfsprogs).

API.</span>

8 月下旬，波兰全国有超过 20 列客运和货运列车紧急停车。安全专家认为，破坏者只是通过无线电频率向列车发出了连续三个声调的无线电停车指令，就触发了列车的紧急停车功能。事实上，多年来波兰的无线电和列车论坛上一直有人在介绍发送该命令的方法。波兰列车使用的是缺乏保护的 VHF 150 MHz 无线电系统，任何人只需要花费大约 30 美元购买现成的无线电设备，就可以触发列车的紧急停车功能。而波兰计划在 2025 年前取代现有的无线电系统，升级为采用支持加密和身份验证的 GMS 蜂窝无线电系统。

谷歌从用户私人保存的链接中删除盗版网址

迄今为止，谷歌搜索引擎已经处理了超过 70 亿次版权移除请求。根据《数字千年版权法》（DMCA）的要求，大部分被举报的链接都会从谷歌的搜索索引中清除。但最近，谷歌将这一范围延伸到了用户私人保存在谷歌的链接清单上。有人反映收到了来自谷歌的电子邮件，通知他的一个链接已从他的谷歌收藏中删除，因为该链接违反了谷歌的政策，已被谷歌搜索屏蔽。这并非是谷歌同步的 Chrome 浏览器书签，而是保存在谷歌上的链接，这些链接收藏可以是私人的，也可以与第三方共享。

                              <span>如果你是在 Linux 或 WSL 环境下进行开发的开发者，以下这个好消息会让你兴奋起来。


JetBrains 平台近日宣布，基于 IntelliJ 的 IDE 最终将实现对 Wayland 显示服务器 协议的支持。可能你并不知道，PyCharm 和 IntelliJ IDEA 就是搭建在 IntelliJ 平台之上的出色 IDE，而由谷歌打造的 Android Studio 也是同样的应用。

Wayland 协议逐步成为 Linux 发行版的默认选择，与 X11 相比，它可以提供更快、更安全和更稳定的体验。如果你使用的编程环境能够支持 Wayland，那么用户体验会得到显著提升。

但是，具体表现在哪些方面有所增强，他们怎么实现这个目标的呢？下文有详细解说。

分数缩放和 WSL 集成

使用 Linux 版本的 IntelliJ IDEA 等 IDE 的用户，终将借助分数缩放，可以在高分辨率显示屏上自定义字体、图标的大小。

无论是多屏幕环境，还是高清显示屏，都可以通过 Wayland 的支持享受到提升的 IDE 体验。

你不再需要担心 IDE 的文本显示模糊的问题。

不仅仅局限于原生的 Linux 环境，同样适用于使用 Windows 的 Linux 子系统（WSL），即那些 “Bash on Windows” 用户。

Wayland 的支持将确保你可以无缝集成 WSL。

此外，作为用户，你还将享受到 Wayland 带来的以下新特性：


弹出式窗口

HiDPI 支持

窗口的交互式缩放


总的说来，通过实现 Wayland 的支持，基于 IntelliJ 的 IDE 将会更具响应速度，实现更高的稳定性和安全性。

构建 Wayland 工具集

让 Java 支持 Wayland 是件颇具挑战性的任务，但 IntelliJ 已经找到了应对之策。

JetBrains 和 Oracle 的桌面团队共同开发出一个基于 OpenJDK 21 的 Wayland 工具集。

由于拥有该工具集，你将获得一系列能力，包括：


基于软件的渲染。

极简的窗口装饰。

弹出窗口，包括应用于顶层菜单的窗口。

提供包括不同每台监视器比例的 HiDPI 和多监视器支持。


此外，他们还计划添加剪贴板拖放支持、基于 Vulkan 的加速渲染，以及使用快捷键在窗口间切换的功能。

你可以通过访问 OpenJDK 维基 来关注 Wayland 工具集的开发进程。

至于 Wayland 支持的具体实现时间并未明确，但可以肯定的是，这项工作正在进行中，而且这也表明 IntelliJ 平台也正在关注以 Linux 为主的用户群。

如需获取更多信息，你可以访问 官方公告 进行查阅。

💬对于 IntelliJ 决定在其 IDE 加入 Wayland 原生支持你有什么看法呢？欢迎在评论区分享你的意见。

                              <span>通常 Linux 系统会默认引导系统进入最新安装的内核，并保留最新的 3 个 Linux 内核引导条目。

假设你已经执行了 yum update，并且新的内核作为更新的一部分已经安装了。这时，由于这个新内核与应用程序不兼容，它会阻止应用程序启动。

想要暂时解决这个问题，你应该还是引导系统进入旧内核。

在本文中，我们将向您展示如何使用 grubby 工具将旧的内核版本设置为 RHEL 8 和 RHEL 9 系统上的默认版本。

grubby 是什么

grubby 是一个命令行工具，用于在多个架构上更新和显示引导加载配置文件的信息。

检查当前引导的内核

你可以使用如下的 uname 命令来检查当前引导/加载的内核。

# uname -r
4.18.0-477.13.1.el8_8.x86_64


列出默认内核

使用 grubby 验证默认内核版本，运行以下命令：

# grubby --default-kernel
/boot/vmlinuz-4.18.0-477.13.1.el8_8.x86_64


要获取当前默认内核的索引号，请运行以下命令：

# grubby --default-index
0


检查已安装的内核

要检查已安装的内核的列表，请运行以下命令：

我们来解释以下的输出信息。最新安装的内核的条目索引为 0，接下来的 较旧的内核 版本将会是 1，第二个更旧的内核版本将会是 2，而 救援内核 的条目索引将会是 3。

# grubby --info&#x3D;ALL | egrep -i &#x27;index|title&#x27;

《大自然的恋人：玛丽安娜·诺斯的画旅人生》（下文引用此书，只列页码），正文由三部分组成，第一部分是小传，二十页的篇幅，简单、扼要地介绍了玛丽安娜·诺斯（Marianne North，1830-1890）的生平；第二部分，“环球之旅”，是全书的重中之重，约一百三十页，按时间顺序讲述了传主在世界各地的旅行；同时，它还遵循英国皇家植物园（也叫邱园）诺斯画廊展览的六大主题，要言不烦、图文并茂地介绍了上述旅途中的一些重要植物：“经济作物”“极其重要的棕榈类植物”“神奇的果实”“神圣的植物”“药用植物”和“有用的植物”。这两条线索自然而巧妙地交织起来，寓教于乐的目的达到了，想必这也是“青鸟新知”系列的宗旨之一。第三部分“画廊”，介绍了诺斯画廊的历史以及邱园对画廊及画作最新的修缮工作。本书的一大亮点在于，几乎每页正文都配有彩色图片，大多是诺斯本人构思独特、美轮美奂的画作。
环球旅行
传记部分的取材，主要来自玛丽安娜·诺斯的回忆录《幸福生活的回忆》（Recollections of a Happy Life）。所谓“画旅人生”，是名副其实的。抛开早期和父亲结伴旅行不计，1871年至1885年间，诺斯只身四处漫游，不论走到哪儿都不辍画笔。今天邱园画廊展出的八百四十八幅绘画作品，基本都是在这一时期绘制的。她的旅行地包括北美洲、牙买加、巴西、特内里费岛、日本、新加坡、婆罗洲、爪哇、斯里兰卡、印度、澳大利亚、新西兰、南非、塞舌尔和智利等大约十五个国家。

作为一种视觉意识形态（Visual Ideology），人种（Race）与人种主义（Racism）实际上是一种很晚近的现象。正如汉娜福特（Ivan Hannaford）指出的一样，在古代以及中世纪的欧洲，“人种”这一概念不论是在生物学还是社会学意义上都不存在。直到十六世纪，随着生物学知识增加以及西方列强的海外殖民扩张活动，“人种”概念才逐渐形成并开始具备其原始的生物学意义。此后，“人种”经过了近两个世纪的争论，在十八世纪获得了社会学的意义，且在此后欧洲民族国家的建构过程中发挥着重大作用（Race : the history of an idea in the West, Washington: Johns Hopkins University Press, 1996, pp.8, 213-224）。事实上，在非欧洲地区，“人种主义”作为一种综合性的解释体系也获得了特殊地位。例如，沙培德（Peter Zarrow）就指出，“人种”的历史解释对近代中国人的吸引力远远地超过了同样具有普适性价值的基督教教义（Liang Qichao and the Conceptualization of “Race” in Late Qing China， 《“中央”研究院近代史研究所集刊》，第52期，2006年6月，113-164页）。
如果说，人种的概念自发明起就注定要进行一场环球旅行，那在其落脚之处会发生何种变异与转化呢？孙江教授的新著《人种：西方人种概念的建构、传布与解构》（江苏人民出版社，2023年）将问题意识放在了这一动态的过程中。许纪霖曾将“当前中国学界的思想史研究”分为“五种不同的研究方法和流派”，即“社会的思想史（如沟口雄三、汪晖等）、文化的思想史（如王汎森、罗志田等）…</span>

作为一种视觉意识形态（Visual Ideology），人种（Race）与人种主义（Racism）实际上是一种很晚近的现象。正如汉娜福特（Ivan Hannaford）指出的一样，在古代以及中世纪的欧洲，“人种”这一概念不论是在生物学还是社会学意义上都不存在。直到十六世纪，随着生物学知识增加以及西方列强的海外殖民扩张活动，“人种”概念才逐渐形成并开始具备其原始的生物学意义。此后，“人种”经过了近两个世纪的争论，在十八世纪获得了社会学的意义，且在此后欧洲民族国家的建构过程中发挥着重大作用（Race : the history of an idea in the West, Washington: Johns Hopkins University Press, 1996, pp.8, 213-224）。事实上，在非欧洲地区，“人种主义”作为一种综合性的解释体系也获得了特殊地位。例如，沙培德（Peter Zarrow）就指出，“人种”的历史解释对近代中国人的吸引力远远地超过了同样具有普适性价值的基督教教义（Liang Qichao and the Conceptualization of “Race” in Late Qing China， 《“中央”研究院近代史研究所集刊》，第52期，2006年6月，113-164页）。
如果说，人种的概念自发明起就注定要进行一场环球旅行，那在其落脚之处会发生何种变异与转化呢？孙江教授的新著《人种：西方人种概念的建构、传布与解构》（江苏人民出版社，2023年）将问题意识放在了这一动态的过程中。许纪霖曾将“当前中国学界的思想史研究”分为“五种不同的研究方法和流派”，即“社会的思想史（如沟口雄三、汪晖等）、文化的思想史（如王汎森、罗志田等）…</span>

                              <span>I can&#x27;t help but feel like that Linux is the more mature operating system over Windows. Linux allows you to change a lot more than you can do on Windows, the Linux Terminal or Command Line can do a lot more than Windows&#x27; Command Line, you make the choices, and you can install Linux on computers that no longer run newer Window Versions. Linux does have it&#x27;s hiccups however, like with Windows App compatibility and some are still scared about Linux, but Linux is doing its best to ease newcomers into Linux, and its getting better and better with Windows apps and games. Linux knows when to show its lovable personally, and with so many options one can do with Linux, it is quite mature!

在更换了 FreeBSD 内核中的排序算法后，其启动速度提高了 100 倍以上……虽然这是专门针对 微虚拟机microVM 的优化，但所有人都应能从中受益。

过去五年，微虚拟机在科技研发领域中备受关注。其核心理念是重新包装和创新了 IBM 在 1960 年代随着 虚拟机管理程序hypervisor 诞生所发明的 一些概念和技术：设计专门作为另一个操作系统上的访客系统运行的操作系统。这意味着该操作系统必须专门构建在虚拟机内执行，并与特定的管理程序提供的资源进行交互，而不是模拟硬件。

这就意味着访客操作系统几乎不需要针对真实硬件的支持，只需要 VirtIO 驱动，它们可以直接和宿主机的管理程序提供的功能进行交互。反过来说，管理程序无需提供模拟的 PCI 总线、模拟的电源管理、模拟的显卡、模拟的网卡等等。结果就是，管理程序本身可以变得更加微型和简化。

通过无情地缩减虚拟机监视器和运行在其内部的操作系统，这让两端都能更小、更简洁。意味着虚拟机能更少的使用资源，并能更快速地启动。

目前，这个商业目标是提供 “无服务器serverless” 的计算能力。实际上，“无服务器” 是一种市场双关语：当然，真实世界中的服务器仍存在于某个数据中心中。但这与提供“基础设施即服务（IaaS）”模型不同，而是提供“函数即服务（FaaS）”的模式。这就代表着你不需要了解任何有关基础设施的知识 —— 你的程序直接调用另一个程序，然后管理工具会运行所需的特定操作，返回结果，然后删除用于执行计算的虚拟机。你根本不需要知道这过程在何处，如何进行。

对消费者来说，这种技术的优势在于其快速和易用性。而对服务提供商而言，因为能够更快地回收和再利用资源，使得相同的硬件能服…</span>

二十年来，安全增强型 Linux（SELinux）一直是主线内核的一部分，它提供了一个实施访问控制安全策略的安全模块，现在已被广泛用于增强生产型 Linux 服务器和其他系统的安全性。SELinux 最初是美国国家安全局（NSA）开发并贡献给 Linux 内核的，并且多年来一直参与贡献，因此其正式的名称是 “NSA SELinux”。但鉴于 NSA 不良的信誉，它一直被怀疑在 SELinux 代码中埋有不为人知的后门，虽然并没有公开的证据可以证明这一点。由于社区的质疑，以及 SELinux 越来越多的由社区参与开发，Linux 内核将从 6.6 开始，NSA SELinux 的名称中将不再包含 “NSA”。

OpenAI 称以变革的方式使用受版权保护的材料并不违反版权

OpenAI 针对作者们提起的一系列诉讼做出了回应，这些诉讼指控 OpenAI 非法使用他们的作品未经许可的副本训练了 ChatGPT。OpenAI 请求法院驳回除一项直接著作权侵权外的所有指控。OpenAI 称作者们 “误解了版权的范围，没有考虑到限制和例外情况（包括合理使用）”。OpenAI 认为，即使 ChatGPT 庞大数据集中的 “极小一部分” 包含了作者们的书籍，但 “创新者以变革的方式使用受版权保护的材料并不违反版权”。OpenAI 辩称，与试图通过传播版权材料直接获利的剽窃者不同，他们的目标是 “教会其模型推导出人类语言的基本规则”，并提醒法庭注意：“虽然作者可以为其图书注册版权，但该图书中与‘词频、句法模式和主题标记’相关的‘统计信息’却不在版权保护范围之内”。

微软使用类似恶意软件的弹窗让人们放弃谷歌

有人反馈，当他使用 Chrome 浏览器时，他的 Windows 11 弹出了一个窗口，要求将 Chrome 浏览器中的默认搜索引擎切换为微软必应。它并不是一个普通的通知，它既没有出现在通知中心，也与 Windows 11 向你推荐新功能的部分无关。它是一个以某种方式出现在临时目录中的可执行文件，并带有微软的数字签名。这种行为让用户感觉像“被安装了恶意软件”一样。微软回应称，他们“已经意识到了这些报告，并暂停了这一通知”。

                              <span>最新的 Mageia 主要版本已经推出，赶快来试试看吧。


Mageia 最初是 Mandriva Linux 的一个分支，但现在已经发展成全面的 独立 Linux 发行版。

从 2010 年以来，Mageia 已经成为一个用于桌面或服务器的稳定且安全的操作系统，并且定期更新。

它的近期的发布公告揭示了 Mageia 9 带来的众多核心改进。

下面就让我为你介绍一下这些改进。

🆕 Mageia 9：新亮点是什么？



由最新发布的 Linux 内核 6.4 驱动的 Mageia 9，与前一个版本相比，有了大量的提升。

以下是一些主要的亮点：


改善了内核与硬件的支持

更新了软件套件

升级了桌面环境


改善了内核与硬件的支持

得益于 Linux 内核 6.4，Mageia 9 配备了 Mesa 3D 23.1，这使得图形支持达到了新的高度。

在硬件方面，Mageia 9 使用了针对 AMD/ATI 显卡的自由视频驱动程序，AMDGPU，能同时支持新旧显卡。不过，似乎专有驱动程序不能用于这个版本。

另外，对于英伟达显卡 ，与 Mageia 8 相比，Xorg Nouveau 驱动的表现得到了提升，并且在非自由仓库中还提供了专有的英伟达驱动程序。

因此，Mageia 9 能够同时支持新款和旧款的英伟达 GPU。

还有，Mageia 9 提供了 X.Org 21.1.8 和 XWayland 22.1.9，这些都已从 Xserver 分离出来，以便进行更加方便的维护。

更新的软件套件

Mageia 9 特色之一是它丰富的应用策略，所有这些应用都已经升级至新版本。

包含如下内容：


LibreOffice 7.5

Blender 3.3.4

VirtualBox 7.0.10

NeoVim 0.9.1

Xen 4.17.0

Ruby 3.1.4

QEmu 7.2

RPM 4.18

Vim 9.0

PHP 8.2


桌面环境升级



首先，由于 Mageia 的默认桌面是 KDE Plasma，让我们先从这个开始。

Mageia 9 带有基于 Qt 5.15.7 构建的 KDE Plasma 5.27.5、KDE Frameworks 5.105 和 KDE Applications 23.04.1。

然后，对于 GNOME 版 ，Mageia 9 提供了 GNOME 44.2 ，现在默认在启动时运行 Wayland，同时提供了 “GNOME on Xorg” 的备选会话选项。

对于 Xfce ，Mageia 9 发行了 Xfce 4.18，现在有专门的 32 位 / 64 位的立付 DVD。

最后，我们还有 MATE 1.26.0 、Cinnamon 5.6、LXQt 1.3.0 ，这些都是 Mageia 9 提供的其它版本。

🛠️ 其他技术性变化

总结一下，以下是一些值得强调的其他更改：


同时支持 PulseAudio 和 PipeWire 声音服务器。

如果禁用了推荐软件包，将减少安装占用。

RPM 数据库现在采用 SQLite 记录，已不再使用 Berkeley DB。

对 Nvidia Optimus 笔记本进行了重大性能提升。


要了解此版本更多详情，可翻阅 发布说明。

                              <span>不喜欢 KDE 钱包不时弹出？这里教你如何禁用它。


KDE 钱包管理器Wallet Manager 是 KDE Plasma 桌面默认包含的一个应用，用于存储和管理密码。

无论是存储网站凭据还是 SSH 密钥密码，你都可以使用 KDE 钱包来完成这一切。它与系统的其余部分集成良好，没有任何麻烦。你可以将其配置执行更多操作（或与更多应用和窗口管理器集成）。

既然 KDE 钱包是一个有用的程序，为什么要关闭它呢？

有时，当你与处理密码/凭据的操作交互时，KDE 钱包可能会弹出。因此，如果你遇到这种情况，我们的指南可以帮助你禁用钱包。



禁用 KDE 钱包的最快方法

幸运的是，你不需要使用终端或任何类型的命令来禁用它。你可以使用图形用户界面（GUI）直接从系统设置中执行此操作。

请注意，我在 KDE Plasma 27.4 上尝试过此操作。

首先，从应用坞或搜索栏打开 系统设置System Settings 应用。



接下来，从左侧边栏中的菜单中，单击 “KDE 钱包KDE Wallet”。


📋 如果你运行的是旧版本的 KDE Plasma，并且找不到下面的设置，那么需要手动安装 KDE 钱包管理器Wallet Manager（kwalletmanager）。

你可以通过 KDE 的软件中心（发现Discover 应用）执行此操作，然后返回系统设置以查找所需的选项。




这里，你可以访问钱包首选项，其中默认启用 KDE 钱包。

你所要做的就是取消选中 “启用 KDE 钱包子系统Enable the KDE wallet subsystem” 选项。



完成后，点击 “应用Apply” 使更改生效。系统可能会提示你使用密码验证操作。



确实，并不是每个 KDE Plasma 用户都使用这个钱包应用。如果它困扰你或与其他应用冲突，你只需将其禁用即可。

此外，你可以探索一些适用于 Linux 的 最佳密码管理器：

十三世纪著名的波斯史家与政治家志费尼（Ata-Malik Juvaini, 1226–1283）在其著作《世界征服者史》（何高济译，内蒙古人民出版社，1980）中提及了一段轶事：有一回窝阔台合罕在猎场时，一个人献给他两三个西瓜。不巧的是，当时他身边的随从身上没有可供施舍的金银或衣服，只有一旁的二皇后木格哈敦（Möge Khatun）耳边佩戴着的两颗如星星般灿烂耀眼的珍珠。合罕便让木格哈敦把那两颗珍珠赏给那人。然而木格哈敦觉得那人不知道珍珠的价值，赏给他等于明珠暗投，于是建议合罕让那人明天到宫帐门前，另给金银锦衣打发即可。然而，合罕此时展现了他的仁慈，表示那人贫无立锥之地，等不到明天。他还预言就算把这些珍珠赏给那人，它们很快也会回到自己的手中。于是木格哈敦便将珍珠赏给了那人，那人高兴地离开了。但那人不知道珍珠的价格之高，便在市集上将珠子以低价卖出了。买主很高兴，认为这么好的珍珠难得，应当献给合罕，于是便来到合罕跟前，将珠子进献给他。合罕高兴地收下了珠子，不仅跟身旁的木格哈敦夸耀自己的预言应验，而且还重重赏赐了献珠者（上册，247页）。
这则轶事巧妙揭示了珍珠在蒙古宫廷中的使用、看法与流通。然而蒙古人作为一个来自内亚草原的民族，他们是如何接触到这种来自海洋的珍稀物品？他们又如何取得与使用这些珍珠？珍珠对于蒙古人而言又有什么功能与象征意义？珍珠与其他类似的奢侈品是如何在蒙古帝国所建立的政经体系中占有一席之地，甚至具有塑造帝国的作用？近期出版的《珍珠在蒙古帝国：草原、海洋与欧亚交流网络》（The Steppe and the Sea: Pearls in the Mongol Empire）就处理了上述问题。

这的确是首先要思考的重要问题。希尔认为：因为阿伦特可以帮助我们通过一个新角度来看待我们最切近的经验，她关注的她那个年代的问题呈现在每一代人面前都是新的样貌，需要我们的理解。（第8页）另外，更重要的是，“我希望她面对绝境的勇气能够激励我们鼓起勇气，在‘我们这个并不美丽的世界’，去抵抗我们今天面对的黑暗”（11页）。直到全书的最后，希尔仍然在回答这个问题：随着过去几年反自由主义在世界各地的崛起，《极权主义的起源》引发了前所未有的关注，有无数文章写阿伦特对法西斯主义和极权主义的分析。阿伦特的作品帮助我们在当下找到方向、面对新现象，“她作品的核心是，我们必须不断地对世界进行新的思考，定义新的界限，绘制新的格局，寻找新的语言，讲述新的故事。这是她留给我们的遗产”（247-248页）。另外，西蒙·斯威夫特（Simon Swift）在回答“为什么是阿伦特”的时候说：“汉娜·阿伦特是我们急需的批判思想家。在她晚期有关美国政治和文化的许多文章中，阿伦特论及了许多在今天仍与我们相关的问题，比如公民自由的性质、国家支持的暴力问题，以及自‘越战’以来政治中的谎言和犯罪文化。”“我们当前的政治危机乃是我们正在经历的新黑暗时代，全球各地的赤裸生命正以各种日益令人不安又陌生诧异的公开方式遭到残酷对待，面对这些现象，阿伦特仍是我…</span>

                              <span>E.T.A.霍夫曼

德国浪漫派代表人物E.T.A.霍夫曼（1776-1822）是一位“多面手”：他不仅是著名小说家、剧作家，也是画家、男高音歌唱家和乐队指挥。照托马斯·曼的看法，霍夫曼堪称十九世纪唯一具有欧洲（世界）声望的德国作家，其作品对后世文学艺术影响深远：舒曼的钢琴套曲《克莱斯勒偶记》直接改编自他的同名小说，瓦格纳的歌剧《纽伦堡名歌手》取材于他的中篇小说集《谢拉皮翁兄弟》，奥芬巴赫（Jacques Offenbach）的轻歌剧《霍夫曼的故事》素材源自他的《沙人》等四部小说，欣德米特（Paul Hindemith）的歌剧《卡地亚克》（Cardillac）取材于他的历史传奇《斯居戴里小姐》。当然，流行最广的是柴科夫斯基的芭蕾舞剧《胡桃夹子》，改编自他脍炙人口的童话《胡桃夹子和鼠王》。至于霍夫曼的文学崇拜者，则包括陀思妥耶夫斯基、安徒生、巴尔扎克、狄更斯以及大洋彼岸的欧文、霍桑和爱伦·坡等一众名人。

霍夫曼生年不满半百，但他的文学成就相当惊人。除了上述作品，他的代表作还有《侏儒查赫斯》《魔鬼的迷魂汤》《雄猫穆尔的生活观》《布兰比拉公主》等，不仅数量众多，而且质量上乘——其构思之精巧，想象之奇崛，即便与现代（乃至后现代）作家相比亦不遑多让。以《布兰比拉公主》为例，波德莱尔认为它是霍夫曼最完美的作品；而海涅则宣称，谁读了本书而不失理智，“谁就没有理智可以失去”。德国文史大家里卡达·胡赫（Richard Huch）在《浪漫派盛衰记》（Ausbreitung und Verfall der Romantik，1902）中盛赞霍夫曼：“通过深入观察心灵的阴暗面，创作了许多源自心灵的奇妙事物。”当代著名作家、诺贝尔文学奖获得者赫尔曼·黑塞（Hermann Hesse）则将“鬼才”霍夫曼的“志怪小说”与中国古代作家进行比较——或据此将这位德国文学史上“仅次于歌德”的二号人物称为“德国…</span>

                              <span>A series of rabbit holes, some of which led to unshaved
yaks, 
recently landed me on a book called Mastering Emacs.
Given that I have been using Emacs &quot;professionally&quot; for more than 16
years—and first looked into it a good ways into the previous century—I
should probably be pretty well-versed in that editor-cum-operating-system.
Sadly, for a variety of reasons, that is not really true, but the book and
some concerted effort have been helping me down a path toward Emacs-ian
enlightenment.  Mastering Emacs may also help others who are
struggling in the frothy sea that makes up Emacs documentation.</span>

百度方面称，还将开放一批经过全新重构的AI原生应用，让广大用户充分体验生成式AI的理解、生成、逻辑、记忆四大核心能力。


百度创始人、董事长兼首席执行官李彦宏表示，当文心一言向数以亿计互联网用户大规模开放服务后，能够获得大量真实世界中的人工反馈，这将进一步改进基础模型，并以更快速度迭代文心一言，创造更好的用户体验。


3月16日，百度宣布正式推出文心一言，并宣布开放测试邀请。彼时，李彦宏在发布会上坦言，“也不能说我们完全Ready了，文心一言对标ChatGPT、甚至是对标GPT-4，门槛是很高的。”


当时，李彦宏承认文心一言与ChatGPT之间的差距，在差距之下依旧推出，是因为“市场有需求。”


6月26日，李彦宏在“世界互联网大会数字文明尼山对话”上谈及文心一言最新进展，称百度文心大模型已经迭代到到3.5版本。与3.0版本相比，训练速度提升了2倍，推理速度提升了17倍，模型效果累计提升超过50%。

                              <span>谷歌推出用 AI 给 AIGC 图像加水印的工具

该工具名为 SynthID，最初将只提供给谷歌人工智能图像生成器 Imagen 的用户。传统的水印方法是在图像上添加可见覆盖层，或在元数据中添加信息，但这种方法很脆弱，当图片被裁剪、调整大小或编辑时，水印就会丢失。SynthID 利用神经网络来处理水印。一个神经网络获取原始图像，然后生成另一张看起来几乎一模一样的图像，但对某些像素进行了微妙的修改，这样就产生了一种人眼看不见的嵌入模式。第二个神经网络可以发现这种图案，这样即使对图片进行截图或编辑（例如旋转或调整大小），水印仍然可以被检测到。

老王点评：果然是用魔法打败魔法，AI 制造的问题由 AI 解决。不过，我很怀疑会不会出现一种可以检测并去掉或扰乱这种水印的工具——即便这种水印工具不开源，也只是减缓对抗手段出现的时间。




黑客清除了 7.5 万部手机上的跟踪间谍软件

间谍软件允许用户不受限制地访问受害者的设备，其工作方式是在一个人的手机上下载一个应用程序，用一个不会被发现的身份，让监控者完全访问该设备。据报道，某不愿透露姓名的黑客声称他们入侵了间谍软件公司 WebDetetive，并删除了超过 1.5GB 信息，涉及到数万台设备，以保护受害者免受监控。这些间谍软件的用户将不会从他们的监控目标那里获得任何新数据。

IDC 称 “PC 之死” 的报道被严重夸大

IDC 研究经理称，PC 需求 “充其量只是不温不火”，并表示 2023 年将是 “消费类个人电脑自诞生以来年度出货量降幅最大的一年”。据预测，2024 年个人电脑出货量将同比增长 3.7%，达到 2.614 亿台，高于 2018 年的水平，但与 2019 年的需求不相上下。与此同时，预计 2023 年的出货量将下降 13.7%，达到 2.52 亿台。

                              <span>Firefox 浏览器内置了截屏工具，你可以用它对整个网页进行截屏。Chrome 浏览器也有同样的功能。


截屏来捕获信息是很常见的。

但你知道你可以在 Firefox 中截取整个网页的截图吗？Firefox 附带一个内置的截图工具，允许你截取选定区域、可见屏幕区域甚至整个网页的截图。

这意味着如果你想保存网页供以后参考，你可以快速捕获整个网页。

Chrome 也有截图功能，但稍微复杂一些。

在本教程中，我将引导你完成以下内容：


如何在 Firefox 中截图

如何在 Chrome 中截图

使用 Nimbus 扩展获得比内置的截屏更多的功能


那么让我们从第一个开始。

在 Firefox 中截取网页截图

Firefox 的内置工具可让你通过单击选择整个屏幕、整个页面，甚至特定段落。

步骤 1：访问截图工具

要启动截图程序，请在使用 Firefox 时按 Ctrl + Shift + s。

如果你不总是能记住快捷方式，也可以从右键单击菜单访问该工具。



如果你经常截图，那么将该程序添加到工具栏将是一个好主意。为此，你只需执行三个简单步骤：


首先，右键单击工具栏并选择 “自定义工具栏Customize Toolbar” 选项

找到 “截图Screenshot” 程序并将其拖至工具栏

点击 “完成Done” 按钮即可


还困惑吗？ 操作方法如下：



启用后，你可以单击刚刚拖动到工具栏的截图图标。

步骤 2：在 Firefox 中截图

当你启动截图工具时，它会提示两个选项：“保存整页Save full page” 和 “保存可见Save visible”。这里：


保存整页将捕获整个网页

保存可见只会捕获当前帧中可见的内容


但如果你想捕获特定部分，你可以使…</span>

                              <span>Linux 内核 6.5 进行了一系列的改善，阅读此文以了解详情。


新版的 Linux 内核已经发布！

Linux 6.5 内核 已经推出，此次更新在 Linux 6.4 内核的基础上进行了进一步的开发，带来了值得注意的改变和新特性。

Linus Torvalds 表示，这是一次相对顺畅的发布：


上周并没有发生任何异常或惊人的事情，因此没有理由延迟 6.5 版的发布。

我仍有这样一个担忧，似乎是因为许多人都在度假，部分导致整体状态比较平静。但目前这次发布进展顺利，所以这可能只是我多虑了。上周的最大更新就仅仅是对我们自我测试的几次修订。


🆕 Linux 内核 6.5：新增了哪些功能？

需要说明的是，这次发布的版本不是长期支持（LTS）版本。如果你期望使用最新的功能，那么这个版本就是为你准备的。否则，除非此版本解决了你关心的特定问题或者能有效提升性能，否则没有升级的必要。

以下是新版内核发布的主要亮点：


AMD FreeSync 视频的即插即用支持

AMD CPU 默认启用 P-State 主动模式

对 USB4 v2 和 WiFi 7 的初步支持

ASUS ROG Ally 音效优化


开箱即用的 AMD FreeSync 视频支持



在这次发布中，重新引入的一项优秀功能是默认开启的 AMD FreeSync 视频模式支持。此特性在 Linux 内核 5.8 版本中首次引入，后因错误而被回滚。

启用 AMD FreeSync 模式后，通过将显示器的刷新率与显卡的帧率相匹配，可以显著减少游戏及视频中的屏幕撕裂和迟滞现象。

用技术词汇来描述，当它在 Linux 内核 5.8 版本中首次发布时，它的描述是：

今年恰逢亚当·斯密三百周年诞辰，中外学界多有纪念活动。3月，北京大学经济学院举办了纪念亚当·斯密诞辰三百周年经济思想史研讨会。4月，美国波士顿学院举办了“亚当斯密与今日资本主义”（Adam Smith and Capitalism Today）研讨会。8月初，浙江大学历史学院举办了纪念亚当·斯密诞辰三百周年国际学术研讨会。在这番盛况空前的热闹景象中，斯密的故乡苏格兰尤为引人瞩目。今年6月，格拉斯哥大学举办了“亚当·斯密三百年纪念周”（Adam Smith Tercentenary Week）；7月，国际亚当·斯密学会（International Adam Smith Society）的年会由圣安德鲁斯大学承办。苏格兰两地纪念活动规模之大，实为历年来所罕见；初入学界的年轻人在架上藏书的作者们面前报告自己的工作，“童子何知，躬逢胜饯”之心油然而生。
几年前国内一位学界前辈访问英国，由苏格兰而至伦敦，谈及风俗民情，幽默而不无严肃地沉吟道：“苏格兰人民富有德性。”我在今年夏天两次从财富密集的伦敦北上德性丰沛的苏格兰，仍能切身感受到三百年前的苏格兰先哲在财富与德性之间上下求索的心迹。回到三百年后的当下，他们的思索仍然是我们的关切，仍然构成今天的斯密学术与苏格兰启蒙运动研究的重要主题。过去与现在的对话、现实与学术的交织，因此成为这两次旅途中最为真切的感受。

格拉斯哥大学与斯密“正统”
格拉斯哥大学是亚当·斯密的母校，也是他后来长期工作的地方。《道德情感论》和《法理学讲义》就是斯密在格拉斯哥大学的工作成果。十九世纪以来，格拉斯哥大学成为斯密“正统”之所在，并于1896年设立亚当·斯密政治经济学讲席教授（Adam Smith Professor o…</span>

2020年6月17日，是我博士生活结束后的第一天。迟来的清晨，仿佛让“恶战苦斗”般的生活暂时告一段落。时光倒流一百年，在1920年的6月17日这一天，同样有一个人感受到了人生中这种久违的宁静。他静静地躺在床上，聆听着家人与挚友的最后告别。三天前，1920年6月14日的夜晚，在那场夺走两千多万人生命的西班牙流感所引发的重度肺炎与高烧中，他向身边的妻子玛丽安妮·韦伯（Marianne Weber）与曾经的情人埃尔泽·雅费（Else Jaffé）喃喃道，“你们祈祷吧，让它结束！”祈祷应验了，他的世界沉寂下来，而屋外则是雷雨大作，一道道闪电划过天空，他苍白的头颅仿若已故骑士的雕像。
这个人便是我们熟悉又陌生的马克斯·韦伯（Max Weber, 1864-1920）。这是一个不时出现在课堂书本、新闻媒体乃至大众文化中的人物，是每位接受过大学教育的人都倍感熟悉的名字。但我们也会觉得他很陌生。他绝非我们的同时代人。在他生活的世界里，登月、相对论、人造卫星、不确定性原理、人类基因解码，等等，这一切都尚未出现；长崎、广岛、东欧、越南以及他念兹在兹的德国所发生的一切，也让他与我们的生活非常遥远；贵族、帝国、革命、大战、普鲁士以及亲友之间一封接连一封的手写书信才是他真实的生活世界。不过每一位韦伯研究者抑或阅读韦伯作品的人，都会自然而然地将他视为自己的“同时代人”。这并不难以理解：虽然韦伯著作的主题宏大艰深、论述缠绕交织，以至于读者需要拨开堆叠繁复的历史材料才能一窥其本来颇具穿透力的观点，但他有关资本主义、理性化过程、权力支配、正当性基础、官僚制度和信念体系的讨论，无一不切中现代社会生活的命脉。

                              <span>&quot;Sugar&quot; is, to a certain extent, in the eye of the beholder—at least when
it comes to syntax.  Programming languages are often made up of a (mostly)
irreducible core, with lots of sugary constructs sprinkled on top—the syntactic sugar. No one
wants to be forced to do without the extra syntax—at least not for their
favorite pieces—but it is worth looking at how a language&#x27;s constructs can
be built from the core.  That is just what Brett Cannon has been doing for
Python, on his blog and in talks,
including a talk at PyCon back in April (YouTube video).</span>

IBM 开发出新型模拟 AI 芯片，大幅降低能耗

IBM 的研究团队近期发布了一款新型的模拟 AI 芯片设计，这种基于大脑模式的芯片设计，可以模拟人脑神经网络的工作方式，实现复杂的计算任务，同时保持高效的能源使用。其性能已经达到了 GPU 的级别，却只有同等级 GPU 1/14 的能耗。这种芯片芯片使用相变存储器（PCM），PCM 不是记录数字系统中的 0 或 1，而是非晶态和晶态之间的连续值，它可将神经网络的权重直接编码到物理芯片上。IBM 的原型芯片能编码 3500 万个 PCM 装置，单个芯片最多能支持 1700 万参数的模型。

Meta 发布了编程的大语言模型

Meta 发布了 Code Llama，这是一种基于 Llama 2 的新型大型语言模型，旨在通过生成和调试代码来帮助程序员。它与 ChatGPT 和 GitHub Copilot 类似，你可以用对话要求它编写代码。Code Llama 可以用 Python、Java、C++、PHP、TypeScript、C#、Bash 脚本等多种编程语言进行编程。该模型有三个规模：7B、13B 和 43B，其中 7B 和 13B 模型速度更快，更适合需要低延迟的任务，如实时代码完成，并且可以在单个消费级 GPU 上运行。

                              <span>今天我在想 —— 当你在 Linux 上运行一个简单的 “Hello World” Python 程序时，发生了什么，就像下面这个？

print(&quot;hello world&quot;)


这就是在命令行下的情况：

$ python3 hello.py
hello world


但是在幕后，实际上有更多的事情在发生。我将描述一些发生的情况，并且（更重要的是）解释一些你可以用来查看幕后情况的工具。我们将用 readelf、strace、ldd、debugfs、/proc、ltrace、dd 和 stat。我不会讨论任何只针对 Python 的部分 —— 只研究一下当你运行任何动态链接的可执行文件时发生的事情。

0、在执行 execve 之前

要启动 Python 解释器，很多步骤都需要先行完成。那么，我们究竟在运行哪一个可执行文件呢？它在何处呢？

1、解析 python3 hello.py

Shell 将 python3 hello.py 解析成一条命令和一组参数：python3 和 [&#x27;hello.py&#x27;]。

在此过程中，可能会进行一些如全局扩展等操作。举例来说，如果你执行 python3 *.py ，Shell 会将其扩展到 python3 hello.py。

2、确认 python3 的完整路径

现在，我们了解到需要执行 python3。但是，这个二进制文件的完整路径是什么呢？解决办法是使用一个名为 PATH 的特殊环境变量。

自行验证：在你的 Shell 中执行 echo $PATH。对我来说，它的输出如下：

$ echo $PATH
/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin


当执行一个命令时，Shell 将会依序在 PATH 列表中…</span>

on August 27 after a nine-week development cycle.  By that time, some
13,561 non-merge changesets had found their way into the mainline
repository, the lowest number seen since the 5.15 release (12,377

A blog post for the occasion has some announcements, including several upcoming releases, help wanted, and a new legal entity to house the project:


Which now brings us to today, when I’m happy to announce the formation of Zarro Boogs Corporation, which will now be overseeing the Bugzilla Project. This is a taxable non-profit non-charitable corporation - we have filed with the IRS our intent to operate under US Tax Code §501(c)(4) (still pending approval from the IRS) meaning the IRS would require us to spend money raised on project expenses and not make a profit, but money donated to us will not earn you a tax deduction because we aren’t a charity (software development is not considered a charitable cause in the US). Unlike Thunderbird, which is a subsidiary of the Mozilla Foundation, we are an independent entity not owned by or associated with the Mozilla Foundation, although they have licensed the use of the Bugzilla trademark to us.</span>

                              <span>据周四发表的一篇博客文章称，Google正在对广告透明度和可供研究人员使用的数据进行一些调整，以符合欧洲《数字服务法案》的规定。在广告透明度方面，Google表示将&quot;扩展&quot;其广告透明度中心，以&quot;满足《数字服务法案》的具体规定，并提供更多有关在欧盟提供的广告定向信息&quot;。


Google的劳里-理查森（Laurie Richardson）和詹妮弗-弗兰纳里-奥康纳（Jennifer Flannery O&#x27;Connor）在博文中写道，该中心是Google今年早些时候推出的，是一个可搜索的信息库，可以让你更多地了解你在Google平台上看到的广告。


根据欧盟新法规，Google、Meta 和其他公司必须解释其算法。对于研究人员，这两位高管表示，Google正在&quot;扩大研究人员的数据访问权限&quot;，这些研究人员可能&quot;希望更多地了解Google搜索、YouTube、Google地图、Google播放和购物是如何实际运作的，并开展与了解欧盟系统性内容风险相关的研究&quot;。


该公司还在其他一些领域扩大透明度，包括设立另一个透明度中心以了解该公司的政策，在其透明度报告中纳入更多有关内容审核的信息，以及分享&quot;与我们最大的在线平台和我们的搜索引擎有关的、符合DSA要求的&quot;风险评估。


Google是最近为遵守 DSA 而做出改变的众多大型科技公司之一，DSA 使科技公司对其平台上的内容承担更多责任。例如，Instagram 宣布将为 Reels 和 Stories 添加按时间顺序排列的内容，但仅限于欧洲地区。而欧洲的 TikTok 用户将可以选择不使用为你和 Live feed 的个性化算法。

                              <span>Linus has, as expected, released the 6.5
kernel.


	I still have this nagging feeling that a lot of people are on
	vacation and that things have been quiet partly due to that. But
	this release has been going smoothly, so that&#x27;s probably just me
	being paranoid.  The biggest patches this last week were literally
	just to our selftests.


Headline features in 6.5 include
faster booting on large x86 systems,
Arm Permission Indirection Extension
support,
Rust 1.68.2 support,
unaccepted memory handling,
&quot;mount beneath&quot; support for filesystems,
the cachestat() system call,
the ability to pass a pidfd via a SCM_CREDENTIALS control message,
scope-based resource management for
internal kernel code,
the deprecation of the SLAB allocator,
and more.  See the LWN merge-window summaries
(part 1,
part 2) and the (in-progress)
KernelNewbies 6.5 page

                        <a class="article-summary-link article-summary-box-outer" href="https://www.williamlong.info/archives/7270.html">
                          <div class="article-summary-box-inner media-object">

                              <span>将浏览器扩展名改用 WebExtensions 系统的主要理由之一是，它使跨浏览器扩展变得更容易。Firefox浏览器用户现在可以享受到这一承诺带来的好处，因为 Mozilla 已经在浏览器中实现了从其他浏览器导入扩展的功能。


Firefox浏览器最新稳定版的所有用户都可以用以下方法启用这项目前正在测试中的功能：



在浏览器地址栏中加载 about:config，确认后继续。


搜索

browser.migrate.chrome.extensions.enabled。


将该功能设置为&quot;True&quot;（启用）。


重新启动Firefox浏览器。



Mozilla 已将该功能集成到浏览器的导入功能中，用户可在首次运行时使用，也可随时从&quot;设置&quot;页面使用。


为此，请选择菜单 &gt; 设置 &gt; 导入数据（按钮），或在浏览器地址栏加载 about:preferences#general 并激活页面上的导入数据按钮。从列表中选择 Chrome 浏览器，展开可用的导入选项，并确保选中了扩展。


导入通常仅限于某些数据，如书签或浏览历史。Firefox浏览器是第一个在支持导入的列表中添加扩展功能的主流浏览器，也可能是第一个这样做的浏览器。


目前，该功能仅限于 Google Chrome 浏览器和部分扩展程序。尽管 Firefox 和 Chrome 浏览器的扩展程序使用相同的框架 WebExtensions，但它们并不能立即兼容。尝试从 Chrome 浏览器的 Web Store 安装扩展的 Firefox 用户可能会发现这一功能无法使用。


Mozilla 决定为 Chrome 网上商店和 Mozilla 附加组件商店中的扩展创建一个扩展对列表。Firefox 不会直接导入 Chrome 扩展，而是从 Mozilla 自己的扩展商店中安装扩展的 Firefox 版本。


虽然这本身很有用，因为用户可以立即在Firefox浏览器中安装一些自己喜欢的扩展，但它也有一些缺点。自定义、设置更改无法导入。这并不一定是个问题，尤其是对于那些无需任何配置即可运行的扩展来说，但这可能意味着用户必须重新进行更改，或者找到导入配置的方法（如果支持的话）。


另一个缺点是，在撰写本报告时，新的导入系统还不支持那么多扩展。Mozilla 网站上的这个页面列出了这些扩展对，目前有 73 个。


目前Firefox已经支持 uBlock Origin、LastPass、AdGuard AdBlocker、Ghostery 或 BitDefender TrafficLight 等扩展的导入。


目前Mozilla正在计划扩展该列表，以便将更多扩展对添加到导入功能中。未来还可能支持从其他浏览器导入。大多数人都依赖 Chrome 浏览器的网络商店来安装扩展，但也有一些浏览器开发商也运营自己的扩展商店。


导入扩展是一项非常有用的功能，希望今后能得到改进。Mozilla 是先行者，但 Chromium 浏览器制造商可以使用 Mozilla 的兼容扩展数据来创建自己的扩展导入。至于这种情况是否会发生，还有待观察。


Mozilla 还在努力解锁 Firefox for Android 扩展系统，以便可以安装所有兼容的扩展，而不仅仅是部分扩展。

                              <span>欧盟《数字服务法》于当地时间25号正式生效，该法规旨在保护欧洲用户免受虚假信息和仇恨言论的侵害。第一阶段，谷歌、脸书等19家在欧洲运营的大型科技公司将面临审查。欧盟负责内部市场的委员蒂埃里·布雷东当天表示，欧盟将对不符合要求的平台展开调查并处以罚款。


《数字服务法》由欧盟27个成员国商讨制定。该法案要求互联网平台企业采取更多措施删除非法和有害的在线内容，包括仇恨言论、虚假信息和假货交易信息等。


欧盟新的数字服务法案（DSA）适用于在欧洲境内运营的19个最大的大型数字平台，包括脸书、Instagram、TikTok和X（前“推特”）等，也包括大型中介商业平台，如亚马逊、扎兰多和全球速卖通。


如果想避免高额罚款，所有这些平台都必须严格遵守一系列措施，以更好地保护消费者及其网络基本权利，打击非法内容，并提高透明度及确保“欧盟单一且统一市场”。


负责内部市场的欧盟委员、DSA主要倡导者蒂埃里·布雷东表示：“全球范围内的儿童色情、网络霸凌和骚乱，已经显示出强大但不受监管的数字空间在我们的生活中所能扮演的角色。”他指出：“欧盟不再相信各个平台的善意或对法律的巧妙解释，而是决定通过明确的权利、义务和保障措施，来建立和恢复数字空间中的信任和安全。”


作为措施之一，这19个在欧洲境内拥有超过4500万用户的“超大型平台”（VLOP），本周五必须已经启用能让它们快速指出和删除非法内容的设备，为此它们必须拥有一个让用户举报非法内容的机制。


它们还必须打击虚假信息，在必要时采取缓解措施，并保护未成年人及打击性别暴力。它们还被要求更加透明，并改善问责制度。


布雷东强调说：“未成年人保护将是一个优先事项，同样的，打击虚假信息，包括亲俄罗斯宣传也是，特别是现在我们正在进入欧洲的选举期。”他认为，“内容限制并不意味着审查”，而是寻求“保护言论自由免受无凭无据的决定的影响”，同时“保护民众和我们的民主制度”。


如果不遵守新规定，平台将受到处罚，罚款最高可达其全球营业额的6%。如果“不诚信的”平台拒绝履行重要义务，“从而危及人民的生命和安全”，在所有有关方面都参与之后，作为最后手段，也可以向司法机关申请暂时中止其服务。


布雷东高兴地表示，随着DSA的生效，欧盟成为“世界上第一个网络平台不再拥有自由处理权，也不再能制定自己标准的司法管辖区；现在，它们是与金融机构一样受到监管的实体”。


他认为，遵守这一规定“不是一种惩罚，而是这些平台增强其作为可靠网站的品牌价值和声誉的机会”。欧盟二十七国正付出努力，以求走在数字立法的世界最前沿。


负责DSA的官员们表示，DSA带来的变化将是深刻而持久的，尽管其影响不一定会从本周五开始就显现出来。“就像银行业改革没有改变你的账户或抵押贷款一样，但它确实在幕后引起了很多结构性监督；DSA的许多影响不会立即就被用户看到，但我们认为它在删除非法内容方面将产生持久影响。”欧盟消息人士强调。


从2024年2月中旬开始，DSA的基本原则将适用于各类网络平台，无论其规模如何。但布鲁塞尔清楚，情况是不一样的，一个本土交易网站所具备的影响力（以及操纵能力）与脸书这样的全球巨头不同。因此，它对后一类，即所谓的“超大型平台”施加了一系列更严格的要求：制定行为准则、实施外部独立审计和公共问责制，以及给予用户不接收个性化推荐的自由等。

                              <span>The OpenTF Foundation has announced that it is moving forward with its eponymous fork of HashiCorp Terraform, which was recently changed to a non-FOSS license by the company.  The organization has applied to become part of the Linux Foundation, &quot;with the end goal of having OpenTF as part of Cloud Native Computing Foundation&quot;.  There is a GitHub repository for its manifesto, but the code repository for OpenTF is private for now, with plans to open it up in the next week or two.  Work has been going on for the last week and more developers are coming on board:

So far, four companies pledged the equivalent of 14 full-time engineers (FTEs) to the OpenTF initiative. We expect this number to at least double in the following few weeks. To give you some perspective, Terraform was effectively maintained by about 5 FTEs from HashiCorp in the last 2 years. If you don’t believe us, look at their repository. 


Some of the people behind OpenTF are participating in a Hacker News thread, so more information can be found there as well.</span>

                              <span>近期，部分自动跳过各类App开屏广告的软件开发者，相继收到来自国内同一家互联网大厂的律师函，称他们的行为构成不正常竞争，干扰了其运营模式和盈利方式，要求下架软件停止运营。各家跳过App开屏广告的软件开发方，分别发布停止运营并下架的相关公告。


8月25日，其中一家软件开发方告诉记者，他们开发软件的初衷，是为了让用户不受广告的困扰，让大家使用更便捷。这款软件的功能并不是屏蔽广告，而是帮助跳过广告。因为该互联网大厂曾表示将索赔十多万元，才不得不下架。


有法律专业人士分析认为，这类软件让用户无需忍受广告的烦扰，虽获用户喜爱，但对商业软件的运营商确实构成侵权。目前，虽然部分软件的“广告跳过”按钮很隐蔽，具有欺骗性、关不掉等问题，但市场具有自我调节功能，消费者会“用脚投票”，行政主管部门也可以对这些软件的运营商加强监管。


手机广告跳过APP“李跳跳”将无限期停更


8月24日，自动跳过各类App开屏广告的安卓平台应用软件“李跳跳”对外宣称，将无限期停止更新。原因是他们收到一份来自国内某互联网大厂的律师函。


该《律师函》称，发现“李跳跳”软件通过屏蔽、过滤该公司旗下某款浏览器的广告服务，吸引用户下载并使用，不正当地取得竞争优势。该等行为干扰了其浏览器的运营模式和盈利方式，构成利用技术手段对正当经营行为的妨碍、破坏，侵害了其委托人的合法权益；同时，该等行为亦破坏了合法竞争秩序和机制，违背了自愿、平等、公平、诚信原则及公认的商业道德，并最终造成消费者福祉的减损。因此，涉案软件屏蔽、过滤广告服务之行为，涉嫌违反《反不正当竞争法》第二条、第十二条第二款第四项的规定，构成不正当竞争。


《律师函》还要求“李跳跳”开发者在收函48小时内停止运营该App，并下架该款软件。


“李跳跳”APP的开发者则介绍，这是一款公益性质的单机软件，没有联网，也没有盈…</span>

马斯克在回应他的推文时，也对TikTok表示吐槽：“我使用过TikTok，却感觉它们的AI正在探测我的大脑，所以我还是不用了。”


马斯克曾于去年6月17日首次使用TikTok，并在当日举行的推特线上员工大会上盛赞其“内容有趣”，“他们在确保你不会感到无聊这方面做得非常棒。”同时，马斯克以TikTok作为正面教材，称不想让推特提供“无聊”的内容。

                              <span>8月21日消息，近日，马斯克在 X 上宣布，将取消该平台的屏蔽功能，只保留“隐藏”功能。屏蔽功能可以让用户完全屏蔽不想看到的账号，而隐藏功能只能让用户不看到对方的内容，但对方仍然可以看到用户的内容。


马斯克认为，屏蔽功能“没有意义”，并在 X 上嘲笑那些反对他的决定的用户，他说：“屏蔽那些抱怨屏蔽功能消失的人很有趣，这药味道怎么样?”


马斯克的决定引起了许多用户的不满和抗议，尤其是一些知名人士。演员詹姆斯・伍兹表示，如果没有屏蔽功能，他可能会被迫离开 X 平台，因为他无法阻止一些骚扰和政治攻击。他说：“如果马斯克取消了屏蔽功能，X 平台和杰克・多西的可怕的 Twitter 有什么区别?我曾经支持过的马斯克，这么做只是为了保护他的广告商。X 平台的用户只是被利用来把网站变成一个电子商场，我以为他是言论自由的捍卫者，结果他只是另一个贪婪的资本家。令人失望，但并不意外。”


马斯克没有回应伍兹等人的批评，也没有透露取消屏蔽功能的具体时间和原因。据悉，目前 X 平台仍然可以使用屏蔽功能，但不知道还能用多久。

Google DeepMind 认为，搜索 “人工智能” 的图像往往千篇一律，重复无聊，包括 “代码流、发光的蓝色大脑或穿着西装的白色机器人” 等。这些 “误导性的可视化” 会给公众对人工智能的认知产生负面影响，并形成不切实际的期望。为了改变这种局面，Google DeepMind 与来自世界各地的艺术家合作，创作出更多样化的 AI 图像。

                              <span>由于电视盒子和智能电视的种种限制，导致很多视频无法在电视上播放，需要使用外部存储设备，例如U盘、移动硬盘、NAS等等，对于多个电视终端设备来说，移动硬盘等插拔起来不方便，使用起来易损坏，NAS搭建较为麻烦，需要额外成本，使用智能电视观看Windows 10电脑上的视频内容是一种常见的需求，下面介绍几种方法来实现这个功能。


方法一：使用HDMI连接线


这是最常见的方法之一。可以通过HDMI连接线将Windows 10电脑连接到智能电视上。只需按照以下步骤进行操作：


确保智能电视和Windows 10电脑都关闭。


将一端插入Windows 10电脑的HDMI输出端口，另一端插入智能电视的HDMI输入端口。


打开智能电视，并切换到对应的HDMI输入源，应该能够在电视上看到电脑屏幕的内容。


这种方法非常简单，但需要确保有一个可用的HDMI连接线，并且需要手动调整智能电视上的输入源，电视还需要支持HDMI接口。


方法二：使用DLNA技术


Windows 10支持DLNA（数字生活网络联盟）技术，可以将Windows 10电脑设置为DLNA服务器，然后通过智能电视访问共享的媒体内容。


在“设置”-“网络和Internet”-“共享选项”-“网络和共享中心”里，如果媒体流未启用，则点击“启用媒体流”。


第一，首先保证系统为Windows 7以上系统的Windows Media Player，打开“网络和共享中心”，点击左边的“更改高级共享设置”，在“流媒体”那一栏中点击“选择流媒体选项”然后点击“启用”。在弹出来的窗口中保持列表中的设备都是处于“已允许”的状态，然后点击“确定”。





第二，接下来打开Windows自带的Windows Media Player播放器，点击“媒体流”，勾选“自动允许设备播放我的媒体”，点“组织”-“管理媒体库”-“视频”，将电脑上的视频文件都集中在一个文件夹里，然后将这个文件夹添加到库中。





完成以上两步后，就可以将Windows Media Player的“媒体库”中视频通过DLNA分享到处于同一个无线WIFI网络环境中智能电视或电视盒子了。


在智能电视或电视盒子端，打开“高清播放器”，电视会自动搜索DLNA设备，如果设置都正常，会看到提示“1个DLNA设备”，点进去，选择“视频”-“文件夹”，即可看到电脑端的共享文件，点击视频文件即可播放。








方法三：使用SMB共享文件夹


共享文件夹可以使多台计算机之间实现文件的互相访问和共享，设置共享文件夹的方法是：


找到要共享的文件夹，右键点击并选择“属性”。


在文件夹属性窗口中，切换到“共享”选项卡。


点击“共享高级设置”按钮，确保共享选项已启用。


在“共享权限”中，添加需要访问该文件夹的用户或计算机，并设置相应的权限。


在智能电视或电视盒子端，打开“高清播放器”，电视会自动搜索网络共享设备，如果设置都正常，会看到共享的电脑，点进去，选择文件夹的名称，即可看到电脑端的共享文件，点击视频文件即可播放。


需要注意的是，共享文件夹协议是SMB，某些智能电视只支持SMB 1.0，而Windows10默认是SMB2.0协议，并且移除了对SMB1.0的支持。而这个SMB2.0协议并不向下兼容SMB1.0，这就直接导致一些只有SMB1.0协议的设备不能和电脑共享。


解决的方法就是重新安装SMB1.0协议，安装SMB1.0协议的方法是：


1.打开控制面板找到“程序和功能”项


2.选择“启用或关闭Windows功能”


3.找到SMB 1.0选项并点+号全部展开打上勾。


上面就是三种主要的使用智能电视观看Windows 10电脑上的视频内容的方法，我个人觉得，使用SMB共享文件夹的方法最为稳定和简单，推荐使用。</span>

                              <span>8月15日，有摄影师发文称“自己拍的照片被视觉中国告侵权，还索赔8万多元”。事件迅速引发网友热议，“视觉中国”相关话题接连登上微博热搜榜。


国内知名摄影师戴建峰15日在微博和朋友圈发文表示，自己今天收到了视觉中国打来的电话，称公众号侵权使用了他们173张照片，还要赔偿他们8万多元，而这些所谓的“侵权照片”竟然是他自己拍摄的作品。戴建峰表示，他的这些作品从未和视觉中国进行合作，也没传过他们图库，结果就成了视觉中国所有的版权。


戴建峰表示，他发现视觉中国发过来的173张照片，是他这十几年陆陆续续拍的，有些曾发表在自己的公众号和微博上，但社交平台上的作品是带有水印的且非高清图。此前，他的一些作品也曾和国外图库网站有过合作，但他从未和视觉中国进行合作，也没上传照片到视觉中国的图库。


戴建峰提供的邮件截图显示，视觉中国称：“近期我司通过监测发现，在贵司微信公众号、网站的使用场景中，未经授权使用173张我司拥有著作权相关权利的视觉作品。经在我司版权管理系统对比核查，尚未查询到上述视觉内容的任何授权记录。”


戴建峰介绍，视觉中国给了他两个解决方案，限期8月18日之前回复。第一是双方合作，由他购买视觉中国素材库网站中的版权素材套餐，购买数量不低于已使用数量（173张）图片，图片单价每张300元，合作期限为1年。合作协议签订后，之前使用图片的责任可直接免责。第二种方案则是双方和解，由他向视觉中国支付173张图片费用，每张500元，一共86500元。


戴建峰表示不解：“不知道我的作品怎么成了视觉中国所有的版权，还要我赔偿，干了十几年第一次遇到。”


戴建峰介绍，他曾授权作品给朋友公司使用，朋友公司也反馈收到了视觉中国的电话，同样被视觉中国索要一定赔偿。他想知道的是，视觉中国从哪里获得了他的照片进行销售的，拿他的照片起诉了多少公司，又获得多少收益？


15日下午，据媒体报道，视觉中国创始人柴继军回应此事称，系误会，已与摄影师取得联系。


8月16日上午，针对视觉中国此前对于图片版权的回应，摄影师“Jeff的星空之旅”在其个人微博上再次回应称：“我不接受你们的观点。我已与Stocktrek进行核实，Stocktrek明确告知我: 视觉中国无权销售我的作品，也没有我作品的任何版权。Getty也无权将我的作品再次转授。这里没有误会，到现在，你们依然在网上非法销售我的作品，向我与他人谎称你们拥有作品的著作权并索赔。请立即停止你们的侵权行为！”


8月16日，Stocktrek Images负责人Ryan表示，“戴建峰已经通知我们了，我正在尝试联系 Getty Images，让他们将他的图片撤下来。”


Ryan也透露了双方协议的部分关键内容。戴建峰与Stocktrek Images的协议约定，Stocktrek Images不会在中国大陆销售戴建峰的相关作品。“从现在开始，我不能再让他拍摄的照片在中国大陆境内的网站上出现。”


Ryan表示，“戴建峰与Getty Images没有关系，这些照片是通过我的公司库存获得的。实际上，Getty Images本不应将这些照片再分发给任何人，但它们将这些照片再分发给了在中国大陆的分销商VCG（视觉中国）。所以我正在联系Getty Images，尝试撤回这些照片并将其下架。”


Ryan同时也认为，视觉中国并不拥有戴建峰的这批照片的版权。


截至16日15时收盘，视觉中国总市值较前一日蒸发超5亿元，跌至115.10亿。


律师解读


据界面新闻，上海大邦律师事务所高级合伙人，知识产权律师游云庭撰文表示，不少记者问我视觉中国向作者收授权费构成诈骗犯罪吗？我初步看了之后觉得视觉中国声明里说自己只有销售图片的权利，但实践中的行为却变成了图片维权，而且可能完全没有获得任何权利，有点无中生有，如果基础权利是虚构的，又有获取较大金额授权费的情况，情节严重的会涉嫌诈骗犯罪：


1、看视觉中国的声明，他们只有图片作品销售的权利，没有图片作品的著作权授权及相应的维权权利，而在本案中，他们向图片使用者行使的是著作权维权的权利，要求对方就过往的使用行为支付每张数百元的图片授权费用。


2、这个行为的性质是无权维权，如果是出于疏忽的，则涉嫌冒名维权，侵犯了图片著作权人的权利。


3、如果是故意的，并且是该公司大规模普遍行为的，除了民事侵权外，则涉嫌以虚构的事实及隐瞒的真相向他人索取较大金额财物的行为，涉嫌诈骗罪。</span>

                              <span>今年二季度，美国对冲基金Baupost集团以及共同基金巨头富达基金等多家知名投资机构增持或新买入了亚马逊股票，推动该公司股价大幅飙涨，也拉动了美股指数的上扬。


美国多家基金上周五提交的监管报告显示，截至6月30日，Baupost集团已经持有96万股亚马逊股票；Senator投资集团将亚马逊股票持有数量增加了35%，二季度末期一共持有44万股股票。


疫情期间，亚马逊的电子商务火爆增长，居家的消费者纷纷在网络上购买卫生纸、生鲜蔬菜等商品，这也导致亚马逊股价迎来一轮暴涨。


但是在去年，美国科技行业掀起了裁员浪潮，科技股大跌，亚马逊未能幸免，股价跌幅超过了一半。


不过今年以来，亚马逊股价大幅反弹，和年初相比，股价已飙升61%。据悉，美国标普500指数去年大跌两成，今年以来上涨了17%，其中贡献最大的就是亚马逊等少数几家成份股。


上周五，美国大批投资机构面向监管部门提交投资报告，报告列出了他们在美国大型企业的具体持股数量。这些投资报告比实际的投资交易滞后了45天，相当于对以往投资交易的一个总结梳理，虽然时效性不佳，但是美国许多的投资人仍然会认真分析这些监管报告，从中发现蛛丝马迹以及跟随操作的机会。


富达基金集团一直是亚马逊的一家大股东，该基金提交的监管报告显示，在二季度末期，该基金集团一共持有2.8亿股亚马逊股票，持股量增加了1%。不过，富达基金并没有把这些持股数量分解到旗下具体的单个基金身上。


美国知名资管巨头GQC公司报告对亚马逊进行了第一次投资，在二季度末期一共持有1548万股亚马逊股票。


根据美国证券交易委员会的规定，投资机构和财富管理经理必须在8月14日（本周一)之前提交第二季度的持股报告（即13-F报告），当天，大量的投资报告也将向社会公开。


对于在第二季度买入亚马逊股票的投资人来说，他们并不了解同时期的亚马逊业务运营处于怎样的状况。


本月初，亚马逊公布了第二季度财报，营收同比增长了11%，超出了华尔街分析师预期值。另外，亚马逊对于目前第三季度的业绩展望也十分强劲，受到财报数据和业绩展望的刺激，亚马逊股价再度大幅上涨。

                              <span>据奇点财经报道，百川智能CEO王小川今日在中国企业未来之星年会上指出，ChatGPT 等大语言模型已经实现“读万卷书”，但没有“行万里路”—— 更多知识来自“对几千年积攒的文字的积累”，但缺乏来自线下的经验。


他补充说，简单来说“坐在电脑面前的工作大概率都会被（AI）取代”，且在电脑前坐的时间越长，工作也就会更加危险。例如平面设计、程序员这些需要长期面对电脑的工作，现在几行指令就能够完成相应工作。王小川更是直言道，“促网是件危险的事，程序员也是自己的掘墓人”。


而与此同时，如果工作需要完成采风、采点、跟别人交流，（被 AI 取代的风险）就会好很多。


王小川旗下的百川智能在 8 月 8 日宣布发布大模型产品 Baichuan-53B，官方表示，“Baichuan-53B 大模型目前在写作、文本创作能力方面，已经达到行业最好的水平”。该大模型并未开源，主要面向 B 端提供服务。


此前报道，关于 AI 是否会取代人类的议题也是备受各界关注。联发科董事长蔡明介曾在公益活动中指出，“技术发展一日千里，当前的 AI 工具可以帮忙撰写个人简历，回答编程类的问题，但如何拥有丰富的想象力和创造力，能清楚地理解和表达情感，并从中获得启示和智慧，这些 AI 无法取代的学习历程，恰是未来人类的重要能力。”

                        <a class="article-summary-link article-summary-box-outer" href="https://www.williamlong.info/archives/7255.html">
                          <div class="article-summary-box-inner media-object">

                              <span>近日，字节跳动旗下云计算服务火山引擎于前日推出了“TrafficRoute DNS 套件”服务，据悉，该“TrafficRoute DNS 套件”实际就是一套“公共 DNS”服务，能够在为国内用户提供更快的地址解析速度的同时，配合“流量清洗”和“IP 黑名单”等服务，抵御外界 DDoS 攻击。


据悉，字节跳动的公共 DNS 采用 BGP Anycast 技术，字节跳动目前在全国提供多个接入点，用户发起的请求将会被转发至离用户最近的节点。


同时该 DNS 也会缓存相应记录，当用户请求命中缓存时，无需向权威 DNS 服务器发送请求，即可快速返回解析结果，以提升地址解析速度。


据官网介绍，火山引擎 TrafficRoute 解析调度套件提供了从公网到私网、从递归到权威的全链路 DNS 服务以及基于 DNS 的流量调度服务，包含了云解析（DNS）、云调度（GTM）、私网解析（PrivateZone）、移动解析（HTTPDNS）、公共解析（PublicDNS）。


从官方给出的产品介绍获悉，字节跳动提供的公共 DNS 采用 BGP Anycast 技术，具有高性能、可靠、安全等特点。


目前，字节跳动已在全国提供多个接入点，用户发起的请求将会被转发至离用户最近的节点。如果公共解析 PublicDNS 在缓存中找到了对应的 DNS 解析记录，公共解析 PublicDNS 会返回缓存的解析结果。如果缓存中没有找到与 DNS 查询请求对应的 DNS 解析记录，公共解析 PublicDNS 会进行递归查询。


如果查询成功，公共解析 PublicDNS 会返回对应的 IP 地址。同时，公共解析 PublicDNS 会缓存该 DNS 解析记录。如果 DNS 查询失败，公共解析 PublicDNS 会返回相应的错误信息。


公共解析 PublicDNS 不会返回错误的解析结果，也不会劫持和跳转用户请求。


安全方面，该 DNS 使用流量清洗和 IP 黑名单等抗 DDoS 攻击方案 ，字节跳动也强调绝对不会利用公共 DNS 劫持用户。


目前 DNS 服务只支持 IPv4 协议，主 DNS IP 为 180.184.1.1（北京），备用为 180.184.2.2（北京），仅提供基本的 DNS 解析功能。

                              <span>今年5月9日，在全球拥有超过10亿用户的职场社交平台领英宣布，中国本土化求职App领英职场将于2023年8月9日起正式停服，也就是说该App今天起停止服务，包括移动端App、桌面端网站和微信小程序等所有领英职场的产品和服务均将停止。


领英2002年成立，2011年5月20日在美上市，是分享学习职场和商场经验的平台。2014年，领英宣布进入中国。2016年6月，全球科技巨头微软“相中”了领英，宣布将以262亿美元的价格对其进行收购。


“领英职场”于2022年12月14日才刚刚上线，香港《南华早报》称，该平台自推出以来就一直远落后于国内其他竞争对手。根据市场研究机构“易观国际”的数据，今年3月，该平台月活跃用户仅有95.96万。相比之下，前程无忧当月活跃用户量达1850万，Boss直聘达1730万，猎聘达670万。

                              <span>OpenAI推出了一种名为GPTBot的网络爬虫机器人，用于收集信息数据以改进未来的AI模型。据了解，GPTBot将严格遵守任何付费墙的规则，不会抓取需要付费的信息，并且也不会收集能追踪到个人身份的数据。


不仅如此，OpenAI也把是否要把自己的网站数据供GPTBot抓取的选择交到给网站所有者，他们可自行修改其robots.txt文件。或者通过屏蔽其IP地址，来阻止GPTBot从其网站上抓取数据。


这当然仍不足够，修改robots.txt是一种方式，但它可以更便利和更具透明度，也可进一步告知数据将被用于什么用途等等。


此前，OpenAI抓取公开数据来训练专利AI模型的行为备受争议。Reddit和Twitter等网站，已经采取措施打击AI公司免费使用其用户帖子的行为，而一些作者和其他创作者也因为涉嫌未经授权使用其作品而提起诉讼。


OpenAI旗下GPT模型的训练需要大量的网络数据，这可能涉及到数据隐私和版权等问题。为了解决这些问题，OpenAI最近推出了一个新功能，让网站可以阻止其网络爬虫从其网站上抓取数据训练GPT模型。


据了解，网络爬虫是一种自动化的程序，可以在互联网上搜索和获取信息。OpenAI的网络爬虫名为GPTBot，其会以一定的频率访问各种网站，并将网页内容保存下来，用于训练GPT模型。


OpenAI在其博客文章中表示，网站运营者可以通过在其网站的Robots.txt文件中禁止GPTBot的访问，或者通过屏蔽其IP地址，来阻止GPTBot从其网站上抓取数据。OpenAI还表示，“使用GPTBot用户代理（useragent）抓取的网页可能会被用于改进未来的模型，并且会过滤掉那些需要付费访问、已知收集个人身份信息（PII）、或者有违反我们政策的文本的来源。”对于不符合排除标准的来源，“允许GPTBot访问您的网站可以帮助AI模型变得更加准确，并提高它们的通用能力和安全性。”


但是，这并不会追溯性地从ChatGPT的训练数据中删除之前从网站上抓取的内容。


互联网为大型语言模型（如OpenAI的GPT模型和谷歌的Bard）提供了大部分的训练数据，为AI训练获取数据已经变得越来越有争议。一些网站，包括Reddit和Twitter，已经采取措施打击AI公司免费使用其用户帖子的行为，而一些作者和其他创作者也因为涉嫌未经授权使用其作品而提起诉讼。
