 I&#x27;ve been daily driving Linux for about 9 months, using Linux Mint, while also keeping my Window&#x27;s partition around for the occasions that I need it. I&#x27;ve been test driving several other distros lately on a third partition. I&#x27;ve run into one problem with trying to install Pop_OS! in that it requires a 1Gb EFI partition in order to install. I managed to just make a second EFI partition, get it installed, and could boot into it just fine by selecting it from my boot options at start up. Mint and Windows were still also able to be booted into, no issues.

 But an Appimage could still be nefarious, for example if it were a password management tool. Does this mean when running Appimages it&#x27;s crucial to do a sha256 checksum or something?

                              <span>I&#x27;ve had quite the long think about what RHEL has been doing to the open source projects a great many of us know and love (first CentOS, now Alma, Rocky, etc.) and I think the problem is summed up like this: &quot;Line goes up&quot;
 If a publicly traded company is behind an open source project, that open source project is at risk because, line must go up. They will make up any excuse why the line is not going up and make terrible decisions to hopefully make the line go up.
 I&#x27;ve been a CentOS user for years and now a rocky linux user, but I think it&#x27;s time to leave that flavor behind entirely. So with that in mind I was looking at other options, Ubuntu being one of them because of the option for enterprise support, but there it is again &quot;Line goes up&quot;.
 This is why I intend to switch to Debian 12, the latest long term supported version of Debian. Debian is bona fide community run open source project with no profit margins, shareholders, executives, etc. Therefore for Debian there is no line that must go up.
 I implore you as Linux lovers and enjoyers to switch to a distribution in no way tied to a company or gets source from a company and return to the community backed projects that made Linux what it is today.
 Edit: it&#x27;s surprising to me people still don&#x27;t know what the issue is. Here is a brief article to explain better than I can: https://www.techhut.tv/rhel-source-code-opensuse-songs/

                              <span>One often stated premise as to why the GPLv2 and certain licenses deemed incompatible by the community is: dynamic linking obviously creates a derived work.
 See for instance the Software Freedom Conservancy&#x27;s view:
  
The FSF, stewards of the GPL, have stated many times over the past decades that they believe there is no legal distinction between dynamic and static linking of a C program and we agree.
  
But is there any solid reason to believe this is the case? Any case law? Any reasoning from similar facts?
 Because my admittedly shallow view is -- I&#x27;m just not sure a copyright license has this kind of power.
 Imagine an extreme case, you build some software which links to MegaEvil Corp&#x27;s libc, which license specifically states, if you dynamically link to this libc, your work is a derived work of MegaCorp libc, and you forfeit all claims of copyright of your work to MegaEvil Corp. My guess is many courts would say building any such software at an API boundary would be fair use, and copyright law simply does not grant any court the power to enforce this copyright term.
 Why might I guess this is the case? Because courts have actually taken similar positions several times re: software fair use. See, Sega Enterprises Ltd. v. Accolade, Inc., 977 F.2d 1510 (9th Cir. 1992), and Lewis Galoob Toys, Inc. v. Nintendo of America, Inc., 780 F. Supp. 1283 (N.D. Cal. 1991).
 But much worse than the SFC and FSF simply being incorrect is, I worry they either 1) don&#x27;t know any better or are 2) purposefully misleading users about what the GPL says, and how copyright law works. By encouraging a cramped reading of the GPL and ignoring copyright fair use, they are actually making it harder to build software which interoperates with other software (see ZFS and Linux), and, while the FSF seemed to take Google&#x27;s side in the Oracle v. Google case, their reasoning re: dynamic linking puts them squarely within Oracle&#x27;s intellectual camp with respect to copyright fair use.

                              <span>The application will consist of a gui and daemon process. The gui will configure the daemon process then will be only used when user wants to view the status information or reconfigure. Gui will not be opened by the user for days or months. So I think the ram and performance concerns of electron should not be a very big factor.
 The daemon will be optimized to use as small amount of ram as possible.

                              <span>Has anyone here successfully installed a Linux distribution on a Surface Laptop 4?
 I am starting a new job and I have to choose between a MacBook and a Surface Laptop 4, and I really want to keep using Linux but I don&#x27;t want to get stuck with Windows if I choose the Surface instead of the MacBook.
 I know about https://github.com/linux-surface/linux-surface but I&#x27;m looking for practical feedback from people who did the operation in order to orient my choice.
 People already suggested that I should use WSL to avoid breaking anything, but last time I touched a Windows computer professionally was more than 6 years ago, so I would have to relearn everything, and not having a tiles manager will drive me nuts quickly.
 A MacBook will be better than nothing, but I rather use Linux if possible.
 Thanks all!

                              <span>Hi,
 So…
 My dad has given me a Minix NEO N42C-4. It looks like he’s put a 500GB SSD in there and also increased the RAM.(not sure exactly on the RAM because he can’t remember). 
 What I would like to do with this Mini PC is run windows 10 on the internal hard drive, just like it would have done out of the box. Then I would like to put Botacera on the SSD so I can run it as a retro games console when I want to. 
 My problem is that it seems my Dad has put the Windows 10 OS onto the SSD so I need help getting windows 10 back onto the internal hard drive and wiping the SSD so I can start afresh. 
 One of the things I tried was to just remove the SSD in the hope that when I booted it up, the Minix would go into some kind of recovery mode and reload the windows OS but that didn’t work. 
 Any help at all would be greatly appreciated.

                              <span>Hi,
 I&#x27;ve been using Linux as my sole OS for years, but I&#x27;ve always had the &quot;weakness&quot; of keeping the original Windows on a small partition of my machines. I only start up this OS once or twice a year (which takes me a good hour or two of updating), just to check for bios updates.
 Does this &quot;mania&quot; make sense? Do you have anything better to suggest?

                              <span>The kdevops
kernel-testing framework has come up at several earlier summits, including 
in two separate sessions at last year&#x27;s event.
Testing kernel filesystems and the block layer, not to mention lots of
other kernel subsystems, has become increasingly
important over time.
  So it was no
surprise that Luis Chamberlain led a 
combined storage and filesystem session at the
2023 Linux Storage, Filesystem,
Memory-Management and BPF Summit to talk more about testing, the
resources needed for it, and what can be done to improve it.  It was the
final session for this year&#x27;s summit, so this article completes our coverage.</span>

                              <span>Over on the Open Source Initiative (OSI) blog, the organization has announced the Open Policy Alliance (OPA), which is meant to bring together various non-profit organizations to help educate and inform US policy makers about open-source software and its needs:

The need to create such a program is more urgent today due to the rise of new regulations in the software industry and adjacent open domains around the world. Cyber security, the societal impact of AI, data and privacy are important issues for legislators globally. At the same time, the COVID-19 pandemic drove collaborative development to unprecedented levels and took Open Source software, open research, open content and data from mainstream to main stage. Moving forward, developing these important public policies whilst not harming the ecosystem requires an understanding of how the Open Source ecosystem works. Ensuring stakeholders without historic benefit of representation are included in those discussions becomes paramount to that end.

The OPA will focus on educating public policy makers on Open Source to inform their development and deliberation of new policy concepts. There are unintended consequences that come from a lack of understanding of how open collaboration works in practice. The OPA will address this as well as the historic absence of contribution from underrepresented groups. The interest areas of the OPA community will complement those of Digitable Public Goods Alliance, a UNICEF multi-stakeholder initiative with a mission to accelerate the attainment of sustainable development goals in low- and middle-income countries that OSI joined earlier this year.</span>

                              <span>Solus 4.4 有了一些令人印象深刻的升级，不久以后将推出一款新版本。




Solus 是一个许久没有出现在新闻中的名字，我们上一次听说它是今年 4 月份它经历了 又一次动荡。

幸运的是，新的组织重组似乎奏效了，因为现在我们在近两年后迎来了新发布！

Solus 是最棒的 独立 Linux 发行版 之一，提供了非常适合初学者的用户体验。

和它的上一个版本 Solus 4.3 相比，它带来了许多改进，这个新版本的目标是超越之前的版本。

让我们看看 Solus 最新版本有什么新特性。

🆕 Solus 4.4: 有什么新内容？



Solus 4.4 带来了许多改进，其中一些最显著的包括以下内容：


更好的硬件支持

桌面环境升级

更新的应用程序套件


更好的硬件支持

前所未有的，Solus 4.4 使用 Linux 内核 6.3.8 作为强大的基础来支持各种硬件。硬件支持包括：


安全启动

英特尔 Arc 显卡

英伟达 40 系列显卡

AMD Radeon RX 7600、7900 XT 和 7900 XTX 显卡

增强对各种光传感器和加速度计的支持

以及更多


桌面环境升级

这是你将找到 Solus 中最关键的错误修复和提升用户体验的改进之处。由于提供了四个不同的版本，我们将介绍每个版本中的新功能。

GNOME 43.5



Solus 4.4 采用了最新的 GNOME 43.5 版本，带来了许多调整。默认的窗口主题切换到了 Adwaita，且默认启用了深色模式。

此外，更新了系统用户界面的样式，重新设计了系统状态菜单，方便快速更改常用设置。

MATE 将被 XFCE 取代



而对于 MATE 版本，Solus 4.4 采用了最新的 MATE 1.27.1 版本。它包括各种可靠性和可访问性的修复，更改了键盘驱动程序，以及将 qxl 视频驱动程序设为处理虚拟化视频驱动程序支持的默认驱动程序。

遗憾的是，Solus 开发团队决定在未来的版本中 淘汰 MATE 版本，并采用 XFCE 版本。这其中的关键原因是 MATE 项目处于非常 衰败的状态，并且 没有计划支持 Wayland。

Budgie 10.7.2



对于 Budgie 版本，Solus 4.4 采用了 Budgie 10.7.2 版本，使 Solus 能够利用新的应用索引器、重新设计的设置菜单、可访问性改进等功能。

此外，Solus 现在默认使用 Nemo 文件管理器，不再使用 Nautilus。原因是 Nautilus 被更改为 GTK4 和 libadwaita，不再符合系统其他部分的外观和感觉。

KDE Plasma



同样，在 Plasma 版本中，Solus 4.4 采用了最新的 Plasma 5.27.5 版本，以及 KDE Frameworks 5.106.0、KDE Gear 23.04.2 和 KDE 分支的 QT 5.15.9。

这带来了许多新功能；其中一些亮点包括：


默认应用启动器被 Kickoff 替换

Wayland 会话默认提供

KSysGuard 被 System Monitor 替换

新的“总览视图”，可用于管理所有活动的桌面/应用程序

支持大屏幕模式


更新的应用套件

除了上述更改之外，Solus 4.4 还包括更新的应用套件，其中包括：


Firefox 114.0.1

LibreOffice 7.5.3.2

Thunderbird 102.12.0

Budgie、GNOME 和 MATE 版本的默认音乐播放器为 Rhythmbox

Budgie 和 GNOME 上的视频播放使用 Celluloid

MATE 上的视频播放使用 VLC Player

Plasma 上的音频播放使用 Elisa，视频播放使用 Haruna


你可以查看 发布公告 以深入了解这个重大版本更新。

📥 下载 Solus 4.4

Solus 的此版本有 四个不同的版本，你可以从 官方网站 获取它们。

                              <span>Linux 桌面份额突破 3%

根据 Statcounter 的数据，Linux 的使用率在过去几年中一直在缓慢上升，趋势非常明显。今年，Linux 桌面的统计数据如下：一月，2.91%；二月，2.94%；三月，2.85%；四月，2.83%；五月，2.70%；六月，3.07%。以上数据不包括同样基于 Linux 的 ChromeOS 桌面操作系统。

老王点评：虽然可能会在未来几个月有所反复，但是从趋势看，未来几十年或许就可以统治桌面市场了。🤣




Windows 95、98 和 NT 4.0 等可再次获得在线更新

自从 2011 年微软关闭了几乎所有的 Windows Update 网站后，旧版 Windows 就不再能得到在线更新了。在此之后，安装更新的唯一途径是通过外部第三方安装程序，而这些安装程序并不涵盖操作系统完全支持的所有更新。现在，有人建立了一个第三方的 Windows Update Restored 网站，使用经过稍微修改的微软原始的 Windows Update 网站的代码，为包括 Windows 95、NT 4.0、98、Me、2000 和 XP 在内的废弃 Windows 操作系统提供了更新。这些更新来自于互联网档案馆的时光机项目，“原样”提供了各种更新包。该网站本身不使用任何类型的 SSL 或 TLS 加密，以便古老的 IE 浏览器仍可访问该网站而无需修改。为了避免你没有，他们还提供了所有支持语言的 IE5 和 IE5.5 的下载链接。


消息来源：Ars Technica



老王点评：其实那么古老的 Windows 系统打不打补丁都无关紧要了。




亚马逊称自己不是“超大在线平台”以规避欧盟规则

亚马逊不想遵守欧洲的《数字服务法案（DSA）》，为了规避相关规定，该公司认为自己不符合欧盟法律对超大在线平台（VLOP）的定义，因此提起上诉。《数字服务法案》包括内容审核要求、透明度规则和未成年人保护措施。例如，将不再允许基于儿童特征的定向广告。被列入必须遵守《数字服务法案》的公司有 19 家，它们在欧盟拥有超过 4500 万活跃用户的平台。亚马逊认为它被不公平地挑出来，“在我们开展业务的欧盟国家中，亚马逊都不是最大的零售商，在每个欧洲国家中，这些最大的零售商都没有被指定为 VLOP。”

                              <span>在本章的 Bash 基础知识系列中，学习在 Bash 脚本中使用变量。


在 Bash 基础知识系列的第一部分中，我简要提到了变量。现在是时候在本章中详细了解它们了。

如果你曾经进行过任何类型的编码，你一定熟悉术语“变量”。

如果没有，请将变量视为保存信息的盒子，并且该信息可以随着时间的推移而改变。

让我们看看如何使用它们。

在 Bash shell 中使用变量

打开终端并使用一个随机的数字 4 初始化变量：

var&#x3D;4


现在你有一个名为 var 的变量，它的值为 4。想验证一下吗？ 通过在变量名前添加 $ 来访问变量的值。这称为参数扩展。

[abhishek@itsfoss]:~$ echo The value of var is $var
The value of var is 4



🚧 变量初始化时 &#x3D; 前后不能有空格。


如果需要，你可以将该值更改为其他值：



在 Bash shell 中，变量可以是数字、字符或字符串（包括空格在内的字符）。




💡 与 Linux 中的其他事物一样，变量名称也区分大小写。它们可以由字母、数字和下划线 “_” 组成。


在 Bash 脚本中使用变量

你是否注意到我没有运行 shell 脚本来显示变量示例？ 你可以直接在 shell 中做很多事情.当你关闭终端时，你创建的那些变量将不再存在。

但是，你的发行版通常会添加全局变量，以便可以在所有脚本和 shell 中访问它们。

让我们再写一些脚本.你应该之前创建了脚本目录，但无论哪种情况，此命令都会处理该目录：

mkdir -p bash_scripts &amp;&amp; cd bash_scripts


基本上，如果 bash_scripts 目录尚不存在，它将创建它，然后切换到该目录。

胡文辉撰《陈寅恪诗笺释》，命我写序，旭东先生对拙序颇为欣赏，令我意外又开心。其后，他的长文《陈寅恪与傅斯年》在《东方早报·上海书评》连登两期，评论陈傅关系客观而公允，钦佩之余，我不止一次地引用过。这回他将已刊文章集结成《藕香零拾》一书。奉读之际，又让我对他有了新的了解。
《藕香零拾》收文三十五篇（含代后记），第一单元为《关于陈寅恪》（六篇），第二单元《关于傅斯年》（一篇），所收即《陈寅恪与傅斯年》，第二十三单元《关于钱谦益》（两篇），先介绍钱谦益作品之版本，再以最长一文对《柳如是别传》“钱氏家难”一章予以补订，仍是陈寅恪研究。而关于吕思勉、陈垣、顾颉刚、牟润孙、陈宝琛、郑孝胥、黄秋岳、汪辟疆、黄永年、黄裳、现代学林各单元，也多多少少和陈寅恪挨着连着。全书描绘的是知识分子的群像，但着墨最多的显然是陈寅恪，因此，未尝不可将张著视为一本研究陈寅恪的专书——而且是朝着陈寅恪又迈进一步的佳作。
“书外之序”
《陈寅恪为他人所作序》是《藕香零拾》开篇之作，作者看得很重，读者也很认同——胡文辉赞曰“深获我心”，“另述感想二章，以当应和”（《陈寅恪〈明季滇黔佛教考序〉书后》，见胡文辉微信公众号“历史的擦边球”，2023年4月11日）。
旭东先生也许不是最早关注陈寅恪序文的学者，但能将十四篇序言打成一片，综括其通义，总称以“书外之序”，已足以让他更高一层楼。而“书外之序”一名，应该是他的首创：
陈寅恪先生一生为他人作序共十四篇。陈先生学术以外的文字不多，仅《寒柳堂记梦稿》几篇而已，为他人作序倒成为他思想表达的方式。这些序引往往不严守本书而逸出书外，其所论荦荦大者，又无不与本书关合，既不离学术本身，又呈现思想的张力和精神的力量。晚辈唐突，称之为“书外之序”。（《藕香零拾》，第1页。以下引自该书者…</span>

 ​
 Original post:
 So RHEL made a big announcement. I don&#x27;t understand what that means, just that I am now getting lots of scary sounding e-mails from CPanel and my web hosting company telling me not to worry.
 I&#x27;m just a casual user so I don&#x27;t understand all the important stuff you guys are talking about in this reddit.
 I run a cheap LAMP stack for some home-brew applications. I ran RHEL once (because of scary sounding things like this month&#x27;s news), it cost me about $400/year to get RHEL. Migrated from CentOS to RHEL thinking it would make O/S upgrades easier (wrong). It was a headache getting to RHEL and…</span>

                              <span>Recently, i stumbled upon cloud VMs and realized I could host my Minecraft server for free on it. 
 (used to self host on a windows computer but wasn’t exactly the best but it worked but now i’m in Uni and FortiGate blocks everything)
 And then slowly realized I could host my own VPN however sadly fortigate blocked that, and then I realized I could SSH tunnel and route my traffic to the VPS basically bypassing the FortiGate Firewall.
 Throughout figuring all this out and trashing 20 VMs on Azure and then switching to google, i found tinkering and learning linux capabilities fun but I’ve run out of ideas of what I could do. 
 Essentially my question is “What else can I possibly do with this Linux machine?”
 NOTE: currently running a 4vCPU, 16GB RAM, 200GB Storage for about ≈ 150$ a month
 (I have no clue if that’s over kill or not tbh this is my first time ever using linux and VM and went with the most i could get out of the free for now)

                              <span>I’ve never used a linux computer before but I want to wipe my old college laptop, convert it, and start learning more about open source programming in general as a hobby. Any recommendations on which version of Linux is best for beginners w/ older hardware? Anything else I should know going in?

                              <span>Hi everyone, I recently started a new IT Field Engineer position and even though I have around 7 years of IT experience, I&#x27;ve never really worked with Linux. This job uses Linux quite a bit, and is willing to pay for training. The two options they gave me were:
  
Linux plus Or
 Linux Administration essentials 
  
Any feedback would be appreciated. Thank you.

                              <span>The systemd-boot package on debian 12 seems to come with a few default configuration files from debian to make the use of systemd-boot instead of grub easier.
 If you want to install it I do recommend reinstalling the current kernel and making sure the apt log shows that an entry is being created for system-boot. Obviously do not try to remove grub immediately. Instead try finding the EFI bootloader entry first for systemd-boot(named Linux Boot Manager) and make sure it works.
 Do note I have not tested secure-boot as I have no idea how to set that mess up.

                              <span>Engineering student and Linux enthusiast here: is dual booting the only option I have if I need to use CAD software during my academic tenure and career?
 I&#x27;m very passionate about Linux philosophy and maximizing use of open source software. However, I need to make use of AutoCAD for several of my classes, and I imagine the same is true in the professional setting. I&#x27;m aware of the existence of alternatives such as LibreCAD and FreeCAD, but from what I understand these alternatives are not up to industry standards at this point in time.
 Is virtualization up to the point where I can viably use it to run the software I need? Or is dual-booting my only option?
 Any advice is appreciated.

                              <span>Guys I applied for the Linux cryptography and security engineer position and got rejected after the take-home assessment round. From other posts, I have seen that you typically get the take-home test after an HR call. But my stages went like this: written assessment -&gt; IQ test -&gt; take-home assessment. So I did 3 rounds with them without talking to a human.
 They rejected me with a template email that they send to everyone. I expect at least some feedback after a non-trivial take-home assessment and multiple rounds. They said they can&#x27;t provide feedback because of the large volume of applicants (that seems unlikely. I see this position posted on LinkedIn every week and it gets 3 applicants on a good week). Can any of you check my assessment and give me some feedback on it, please?
 Project: Github link (the problem statement is there, it is a client-server application where the server verifies the X509 certificate of the client)
 P.S. I know you shouldn&#x27;t accept take-home assessments, especially without even receiving a call from them. But I have seen people unemployed for months and I am freaked out.

                              <span>Hello everyone,
 This is going to be a long one. But I&#x27;ll explain the basic of it in the first paragraph.
 ​
 Why only LMDE5 Cinnamon is the only distro &amp; DE I don&#x27;t have any bad experience with? (Fedora 38 Gnome Wayland, was also doing great until an update completely broke it and I couldn&#x27;t recover from it). Can someone maybe have an idea?
 Curious to hear if anyone got similar problems that only one type of distro/DE seems to be fine for you.
 *** I mainly want to start a discussion &amp; not having anyone really trying to troubleshoot my linux issues, but any advice is welcome.
 That&#x27;s the summary.
 ​
 The TLDR part :
 So first here my pc specs:
 - Motherboard: MSI x570s Tomahawk Max Wifi
 - CPU: AMD Ryzen 9 5950X (32) @ 3.980GHz
 - GPU: NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3080 Ti (EVGA FTW3)
 - RAM: 32GB …</span>

                              <span>The Filesystem
in Userspace (FUSE) framework can be used to create a &quot;stacked&quot;
filesystem, where the FUSE piece adds specialized functionality
(e.g. reporting different file metadata) atop an
underlying kernel filesystem.  The performance of such filesystems leaves a
lot to be desired, however, so
the FUSE
BPF filesystem has been proposed to try to improve the performance to
be close to that of the underlying native filesystem.  It came up in the
context of a session on FUSE passthrough
earlier in the
2023 Linux Storage, Filesystem,
Memory-Management and BPF Summit, but the details of FUSE BPF were more
fully described by Daniel Rosenberg in a combined filesystem and BPF
session on the final day of the summit.</span>

it contains a handful of fixes, mostly for problems associated with the per-VMA locking code.  Anybody running 6.4
probably wants this update.

Note that there is a much larger 6.3.13
update going through a longer-than-usual review process that should show up
soon.

                              <span>Oracle 嘲讽 IBM/红帽，建议 RHEL 成为 Oracle Linux 下游

在红帽限制了对 RHEL 源代码的访问之后，AlmaLinux 和 Rocky Linux 已经表示将克服困难继续推出 RHEL 克隆版。而现在，另外一个 RHEL 兼容发行版 Oracle Linux 也发表了他们的看法和行动。在一篇《保持 Linux 开放和自由 —— 我们损失不起》的新闻稿中，他们指出，Oracle 打算继续推动 Oracle Linux，并使其与上游的 RHEL 保持兼容，尽管他们没有说明将采取哪些步骤来获取未来的源代码。此外，他们还做出承诺，“只要 Oracle 分发 Linux，Oracle 将公开和免费提供该发行版的二进制文件和源代码。”并表示他们欢迎任何类型的下游发行版，包括社区和商业发行版。因为红帽曾在回应文章中提及他们不想继续公开发布 RHEL 的源代码的原因是红帽“必须为这些工作的人支付报酬”，所以最后 Oracle 还嘲讽了 IBM，“你说你不想为所有那些 RHEL 开发人员付费吗？你可以节省金钱的方法很简单：从我们这里获取。成为 Oracle Linux 的下游发行商。我们将乐意承担这一责任。”并且，在公告中他们还顺便对那些反对 IBM/红帽这一做法的 Linux 开发者抛出了橄榄枝。

老王点评：真是没想到向来被认为对开源不友好的 Oracle，反而有嘲讽被视为开源先锋的红帽和 IBM 的一天啊！这世界真是变得快，曾经的开源公敌微软变成了最大的开源贡献公司，而将 Sun 公司遗产挥霍殆尽的 Oracle 如今却试图制造初另一个伟大的 Linux 发行版。




SUSE 也来踩上一脚，宣布将复刻一个 RHEL 兼容发行版

在 Oracle 发布上述声明后，SUSE 公司宣布将对公开可用的 RHEL 进行复刻，并开发和维护一种可供所有用户自由使用的 RHEL 兼容发行版。根据公告中泄露的信息，该发行版名称可能被称作 “Liberty Linux”。SUSE 计划成立一个开源基金会，将他们对这个 RHEL 复刻项目的工作贡献给基金会，以确保持续自由访问这个替代源代码。在接下来的几年里，SUSE 计划投入 1000 万美元以上用于这个项目。他们表示，“协作和共享成功一直是我们开源社区的基石。我们有责任捍卫这些价值观。”此外，SUSE 还将继续全力投资于 openSUSE 及其企业 Linux 发行版 SLE。


消息来源：SUSE



老王点评：SUSE 本来就是兼容 RPM 的发行版，所以 SUSE 公司的团队做到这一点并不困难，但是我真没想到这个时候 SUSE 也会站出来。所谓“秦失其鹿，天下共逐之”。现在，就看国内的龙蜥和欧拉会不会表态了。




Bcachefs 文件系统无缘 Linux 6.5，Torvalds 呼吁大家保持冷静

Linus Torvalds 已经发布了 Linux 内核 6.5 版的第一个候选版本，但 Bcachefs 没有合并进入这个版本。对 Bcachefs 的拉取请求导致了一个很长的讨论会话，虽然还没有到 100 封邮件，但已经不远了。Bcachefs 是一个已经开发了近十年的文件系统，它源自于名叫 Bcache 的内核块层缓存，项目开发者希望能提供类似 XFS/EXT4 的性能以及类似 Btrfs 和 ZFS 的特性。该文件系统的状况良好，但关于 “内核模块本身之外的内核所需的代码变更” 的争论却引发了争议。因此，每当话题转向 Bcachefs 时，Linux 内核邮件列表上的对话 “经常变得激烈”。在 rc1 的公告中，Torvalds 写道：“让我们来平息这场狂欢吧”。

老王点评：真是众口难调啊，集市式开发就会像集市一样吵吵闹闹，作为 Linux 内核的最终裁决者，Linus 也挺难的。</span>

                              <span>看看以下哪个 Linux 应用坞最适合你。


应用坞Dock 在提升 Ubuntu 或其他 Linux 发行版上的用户体验和生产力方面起着至关重要的作用。凭借其流线型和直观的设计，应用坞可快速访问经常使用的应用程序、系统设置和工作区管理。

应用坞是个复杂的应用程序，在 Linux 生态系统中仅有少数活跃项目可用。这可能是因为桌面环境提供了将相应的默认面板转换为应用坞的内置功能。

然而，以下是适用于 Ubuntu 和其他 Linux 发行版的 7 个最佳应用坞。

Linux 的最佳应用坞

Plank

最受欢迎和知名的应用坞是 Plank，许多发行版将其作为默认应用坞。例如，elementary OS 使用 Plank 做为其 Pantheon 桌面环境的应用坞。

Plank 的最佳特性是其完备性，无需进行任何自定义。它在默认设置下外观出色，并能适应任何发行版。



你可以使用以下命令在 Ubuntu、Linux Mint 及相关发行版上安装 Plank：

sudo apt install plank


安装完成后，你可以通过命令提示符中输入 plank，或通过应用程序菜单启动它。如果你在 Ubuntu 上使用它，请确保使用任何 GNOME 扩展（例如 Just Perfection）隐藏默认的左侧 启动器Dash。

注意： Plank 在 Wayland 上无法工作。你需要使用 X.Org 会话。

Dash to Dock 扩展

如果你正在使用最新的 Ubuntu GNOME 桌面环境，则可以尝试 “Dash to Dock” 扩展。它不是独立的应用程序，但可以将你的启动器转换为简单的应用坞。



该扩展还提供了几个功能，如在多个监视器上显示应用坞、设置大小/图标大小和位置。你还可以自定义其不透明度，使用内置主题…</span>

                              <span>CloudReady 日趋流行，尤其是在使用低端硬件的用户中。我决定了解一下它并分享我的发现。


什么是 CloudReady？

CloudReady 是一个基于谷歌的 Chromium OS 开源代码仓库的操作系统。Neverware 公司是 CloudReady 背后的组织，它开发的 CloudReady 可以部署到现有的 PC 和 Mac 上，由于其对硬件的要求极低，因此可以保证在上述硬件上的性能提升。大体上来说，CloudReady 把你的旧计算机变成了 Chromebook。2020 年底 Google 收购了 Neverware。

在分享我的经验和想法之前，让我先进一步介绍以下它。

谁应该尝试 CloudReady？



CloudReady 主要是面向那些能够从使用类 Chromebook 设备中获益，但是已经在硬件设备上进行了投入的机构。下面是我想到的一些例子：


经过 CloudReady 扩展的 Chromium OS 用户界面足够简单，用户从 macOS 或 Windows 转向使用 CloudReady 几乎不需要培训。

更好的安全性，用户不会被安装充斥于 macOS 和 Windows 上的恶意软件。

Chromium OS 的硬件要求低，能够在老旧的硬件上良好运行。

通过“谷歌管理控制台Google Admin Console”来管理计算机。

简单初始安装过程。


下面是运行 CloudReady 的最低硬件要求：


CPU：任何 2008 年之后的 CPU （没有提及对 ARM 架构 CPU 的支持情况，暂且认为仅支持 x86 架构 CPU，即英特尔和 AMD 的 CPU）

内存：2 GB 及以上

存储：16GB 及以上

“使得战争无可避免的原因，是雅典日益壮大的力量，还有这种力量在斯巴达造成的恐惧。”伟大的希腊历史学家修昔底德在他的旷世名作《伯罗奔尼撒战争史》中作如是说。2012年，美国哈佛大学教授格雷厄姆·艾利森据此提出了所谓的“修昔底德陷阱”，声称一个新兴大国必然会挑战守成大国的地位，而守成大国也必然会采取措施进行遏制和打压，两者的冲突甚至战争在所难免。然而，新颖的词汇难掩陈词滥调。对于广大历史学者、国际关系学者而言，这一“创新”论断如此耳熟能详，足以让这样一个名字重新浮现眼前——保罗·M.肯尼迪。
身兼美国耶鲁大学历史学教授与英国皇家历史学会会长，1945年出生在英格兰的保罗·肯尼迪可谓是英美当代国际关系史的中流砥柱，其研究贯穿帝国史、殖民史、海军史、英德关系等。早在1973年，二十八岁的肯尼迪便以《萨摩亚的纠纷：对1878-1900年英、德、美关系之研究》一鸣惊人，此后又连续出版了《英国海上霸权的兴衰》（1976年）、《英德对抗的兴起，1860-1914》（1980年）、《外交背后的现实：1865-1980年英国外交政策的影响》（1981年）和《战略与外交》（1983年）。其中《英德对抗的兴起》被西方学术界评论誉为“一方面透彻地分析了国际关系背景的变化，另一方面有力地叙述了个人和杰出人物在决策过程中的作用”。可以说，肯尼迪起自萨摩亚问题的多边关系研究，在英德对抗的互动追溯中明确了自己独特的观点与研究视域，最终在1987年的《大国的兴衰》一书中集于大成，跻身当代史学研究大家之列。而商务印书馆2022年编译的这部《英德对抗的兴起，1860-1914》，无疑正是保罗·肯尼迪形成中的以大国兴衰、海洋战略、工业实力与全球外交为…</span>

                              <span>I quit my job last year and worked mostly on this full SwiftUI rewrite of my Japanese reading app, Manabi Reader. The rewrite gave me the opportunity to expand to macOS (and without Catalyst so it feels extra native) and redo the data layer to be offline-first via Realm with iCloud sync.
The biggest differentiators compared with other language study apps are that it tracks every word/kanji you read so that you can see how much of a given webpage/article you&#x27;re already familiar with and other features/analytics built on that foundation; it automatically builds a personal corpus of example sentences; and that it does all the Japanese tokenization/dictionary lookups locally on-device and in a flexible web browser-like UI with readability mode, to be respectful of your privacy and to work offline.
I&#x27;ve also added Anki integration. Tap a word, tap another button to save it to Anki with the original source material sentence and URL. I have a Manabi Flashcards app as well if you don&#x27;t like Anki.
Packed with free features. See what percent of each article&#x27;s vocabulary you&#x27;re familiar with based on your reading history. Scan paragraphs of text with your camera to look up words. Japanese/English dict. Native Japanese web dicts. Look up kanji by drawing. Expanded JLPT levels. RSS. Web browser UI. Save links from other apps. Works offline. Readability mode. Tap words to look them up. Furigana depending on your familiarity with each word.
Future plans: besides more features (ePUB, YouTube, mpv player, WaniKani integration, more languages, etc), I’m also preparing the underlying SwiftUI web browser lib as open source and will launch it as a WebKit-based browser/reader option, which I’m excited to get out alongside other interesting recent entrants to the desktop and mobile browser market.

                              <span>Long-simmering side project that is finally ready to see the light. HAMTs are a cool persistent data structure and implementing one has been a lot of fun. Beyond the code, there is likely some value in the extensive and largely complete implementation docs; basic benchmarks are linked in the README, too.
Kind of aiming to be &quot;the libavl for HAMTs&quot;. That is obviously a high and aspirational bar but a distinct possibility if it stirs up a little interest and/or contribution.
Anyways, it&#x27;s time for this to go out, collect feedback and maybe even some use outside of toy projects. Let me know how it goes.

                              <span>I always enjoy reading posts about indie game development and looking at the source code of games other people have built. So for any game I release I naturally I want to do the same.
https://github.com/Mknsri/HockeySlam
Hockey Slam is a hockey shootout game on Android which I built almost from scratch. Some of the engine features include 3D graphics with PBR materials, a rudimentary physics system, replays, a multithreaded job system and a hot-reload DLL platform for developing on Windows.
I detailed the creation of the game in it&#x27;s own post, but now that time has passed I am releasing the source code and assets under the MIT license. You can still find the making of here: https://hockeyslam.com/makingof
I&#x27;m happy to answer any questions you might have.

                              <span>My friend and I have been feeling frustrated at how inefficient it is to find information at work. There are so many tools (Slack, Confluence, GitHub, Jira, Google Drive, etc.) and they provide different (often not great) ways to find information. We thought maybe LLMs could help, so over the last couple months we&#x27;ve been spending a bit of time on the side to build Danswer.
It is an open source, self-hosted search tool that allows you to ask questions and get answers across common workspace apps AND your personal documents (via file upload / web scraping)! Full demo here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;geNzY1nbCnU&amp;t&#x3D;2s.
The code (https://github.com/danswer-ai/danswer) is open source and permissively licensed (MIT). If you want to try it out, you can set it up locally with just a couple of commands (more details in our docs - https://docs.danswer.dev/introduction). We hope that someone out there finds this useful
We’d love to hear from you in our Slack (https://join.slack.com/t/danswer/shared_invite/zt-1u3h3ke3b-...)  or Discord (https://discord.gg/TDJ59cGV2X). Let us know what other features would be useful for you!

                              <span>Is there any way to make fonts &quot;thicker&quot;? Small font sizes are very thin and hard to read, on macOS even small fonts are &quot;thick&quot; and very readable. 
 I mainly mean fonts in terminal - tried kitty and wezterm but neither of them seem to render font in a thick-macOS way...

                              <span>I’m running Fedora 38 and I’m just now learning to program in C, and compile source code. I tried to compile this code I found online (tetris in C in 200 lines) and it was saying it couldn’t find ‘ncurses.h’. I looked it up and I was supposed to dnf install ncurses-level-ncurses or something like that, the dashes might’ve been underscores. The compile didn’t work anyway and I didn’t care enough to keep trying it, so I just moved on and uninstalled ncurses-level-ncurses. Then Snaps and Flatpaks completely stopped working on Wayland so I switched to Gnome on Xorg. I reinstalled that package and Wayland worked perfectly again. If for whatever reason you install that package, do not uninstall it because it’s got some dependency in it for running Flatpak and Snap packages on Wayland.

The post covers many issues with data collection/telemetry and issues relate to it. I don&#x27;t expect everyone to agree with my view points, but we can agree to disagree. If you disagree, please put your opinions/ideas/disagreements into words. A down vote click says nothing about why you disagree, what part/parts you disagree with, or if you have improvements to my ideas.

 There’s only like three line on the screen after I restart the computer for an update, the last line says BFPT parsing failed. Please consider using SPI_NO. There was a line about SGX needing to be enabled and after enabling it nothing happens besides the line disappearing.

                              <span>I basically want to run these as thin clients again connecting to an oldish windows RDP server (but without the dell nonsense I think would be best) I have experience of Ubuntu (Lubuntu) and some Debian (Raspbian) they have a 4gb eMMC of some kind so I guess small is good, my old Lubuntu on a usb is only about 2gb installed with some added software so I&#x27;d default to installing that but just wondered if there&#x27;d be better options, 
 I&#x27;ve not done a large roll out (10+ of any linux before) we&#x27;ve probably ended up with slightly more Pi&#x27;s than that but slowly over the years, this will be 30+ so I&#x27;d like to image/network boot to install an image or something :-) thanks

                              <span>i don&#x27;t want to sudo or anything to do that. i want my current user to be able to do that. via adding it to some group or something?
 also, i don&#x27;t just want to su to work. actually, i don&#x27;t care about su. i want the syscalls to work. i am using golangs SysProcAttr.Credential api.
 if there a better way in golang like where i can pass password for account or something. its more than enough...
 for now i am running inside docker. again, in docker, it&#x27;s running as root by default. so things work out without touching anything.

 $perf bench mem memcpy
 $perf bench mem find_bit
 $perf bench futex wake-parallel
 and so on ?
 I know that &quot;Flame Graphs&quot; is used to visualize the output of &quot;perf record&quot;, but what about perf-bench.
 I am just newly using it and don&#x27;t want to reinvent the wheel, Thanks

                              <span>Vent + Funny Story
 Around 5 minutes and my mother and I were arguing over f*cking linux. She said what am I doing with my computer and I just said installing Linux which was HORRIBLE to her. She said I was breaking my PC with unknown software.
 I tried to explain what linux was saying it&#x27;s an open-source competitor to windows and it was safe nor damaging anything. Apparently I needed further justification so I stated (I use a cracked version of windows) it had more customizability, offered more safety and privacy. Apparently I have &#x27;something to hide&#x27; for context I have a history of anxiety &amp; psychosis which is known to her.
 Eventually she looked up what linux was: &#x27;All the top results said it was great but when I scrolled down it said tor was used for terrorist, drug deals and various other crimes. She didn&#x27;t even notice that tor and linux was different from 5 minutes of research. I tried to argue saying it was cherry-picked and a scandal by the media to which and I kid you not she compared me to flat earthers. I know tor &amp; linux are used for crime but jesus christ that&#x27;s a jump.
 She threatened to take my computer away which I am not a child (later years of HS), I guess she thinks I&#x27;m psychotic for wanting privacy for f*ck sakes.
 Also throwaway because if she found my main and my slightly-deviant opinions on various topics I might as well write a note saying goodbye.
 PS: Tips on hiding Linux are greatly appreciated and programs to encrypt my drives. Fml...

                              <span>Hi everyone!
 I&#x27;ve been researching this topic for quite some time, but I always run into some issues. Before heading into the topic, I would like to be able to install these applications/packages on the OS that runs them:
 ​
 plasma-desktop ufw sddm sddm-kcm openssh(with rsync)
 nano ranger htop git konsole dolphin firefox gnome-disk-utility neofetch gimp vlc Libreoffice-fresh kdeconnect obsidian
 Teamviewer, thunderbird, timeshift
 ​
 The key applications:
  
Visual Studio Code (HTML, CSS, Javascript)
 Pycharm (Python)
 MYSQL Workbench (SQL)
  
​
 All these in a portable os on a usb stick.
 ​
 Here are the problems I encountered (I head dived in first without any knowledge on the terms or the topic, so there are a lot of dumb oversights that could have been overcome, if I read a few guides)
  
Tails OS - I was told/read somewhere that its great stock, but if you want to install any new applications then its a nightmare and has a very steep learning curve. Its based on debian and apparently pycharm isn&#x27;t fully supported in it.
 Arch Linux- I tried getting MYSQL workbench to work but it just wouldn&#x27;t recognize a mariadb server or a percona one. I tried getting the vanilla one but to no avail, I have absolutely no clue up to this date on that, but the other applications seem to work well.
  
So I was thinking... what other distros are good for portable OS?
 P.S. Thanks for reading through this massive message ^^

                              <span>Linux shell commands are powerful, but also complex. Not only are novices unable to remember, but often many veterans may not be able to master some shell commands well. Recently developed a small tool: OSLUI, the goal is to do the natural language interface of the operating system, so that people can get rid of the Shell and directly interact with the computer through natural language. GitHub address: https://github.com/BalianWang/OSLUI. Welcome to star~
 At present, two functions are mainly implemented:
 One is to interact with Linux through natural language

 The second is to talk to GPT in Terminal

 The project has just started, better experience and more powerful functions are coming...

                              <span>I love both WebCord and discord-screenaudio, but for me and a lot of my friends, streaming using any chromium application is a laggy mess, especially when streaming games! As a result, I built this extension which feeds audio nodes to WebRTC streams, currently only works with Firefox and Pipewire. I have packaged it for NixOS, but I need package maintainers for other distros too. Anyone willing to help by packaging the native part of the extension or just contributing to the project, is welcome!

                              <span>翻译这件事比写作更磨人，去年4、5月间读的几十本杂书里不少是小说，有原文，也有译文，读到好或不好的译笔都传讯息和周克希先生分享，向他请教，周先生真是耐心，有问必答，给我很多指点，指点越多我也就越明白自己没有当翻译家的能力。周先生在《译边草》里说：“翻译，寂寞而清苦，但能把职业当作事业，能使技术成为艺术，又何尝不是人生的一种幸福呢？”这样的幸福又朴素又高妙，能体会的人注定只是少数。最近读完青年翻译家陈以侃译的四卷本《毛姆短篇小说全集》和长篇小说《刀锋》，我猜他或许也尝到了此中甘味，毛姆文笔里的克制、冷静、淡漠、聪黠，陈以侃译得都得体，都传神，真的是“使技术成为艺术”了。
陈以侃在毛姆短篇集的译后记里说：“最早应该算是上了香港一位董先生的当：中学时的特长是熟读各种董桥文集，一直认定这世上写英文是没有人写得过毛姆的。”他还说董先生的《从前》他读得最熟，淡淡的气氛里，鲜明的人和事，和毛姆太像了。和董先生一样，陈以侃大学念的是英文系，相信他一定是用功读过好几代人的英美文学作品才有了发现自己“上当”的本事，才敢说自己上了董先生的“当”。我比陈以侃虚长十几岁，算起来他在中学里熟读董先生文集的年代应该也是我开始追读董先生文章的年代，快二十年了，我没陈以侃那么长进，不觉得自己上过董先生的“当”，倒是一直中着董先生的“毒”，无药可救，也乐此不疲。
黄花梨、紫檀“毒”得温润；竹雕、漆盒“毒”得细腻；铜炉、古玉“毒”得典雅；溥心畬、台静农、张充和“毒”得清贵；藏书票、版画“毒”得香艳。这十几年我有缘从董先生家的客厅走进餐厅，从餐厅走进书房，越往里走中“毒”越深。那间小小的书房里藏了董先生几十年来搜罗的古董西书，有些书能留在这里是因为版本：伊恩·弗莱明“007系列”第一部《皇家赌场》的初版有作者签名，听说要六万英镑，比《皇家赌场》更贵的是简·奥斯汀的《傲慢与偏见》，1813年的初版，董先生和我透过价…</span>

“考古学”是不是一门外来的学问，乃现代中国学术史上最具争议性的问题之一。1926年10月，瑞典皇太子古斯塔夫访华。这位爱好考古的“边缘”大人物之所以到中国来，缘于他的朋友安特生在中国的数年调查发掘，为斯德哥尔摩成为世界首屈一指的中国古代艺术品收藏地贡献巨大。北京学界激动之余，安排了一系列活动，以展现“现代学术”在中国的发展面貌。其中当然以安特生公布在周口店的最新发现——古人类遗存为重头戏。梁启超作为中国学界领袖、新史学巨擘，也发表了演讲，题目是《中国考古学之过去及将来》。他一改常态，只字不提“欧洲考古学会”与“物质上之公例”，而是细数中国过去尤其是清代，四部分类中所谓“小学”与“金石”等门类的成果，称中国考古学过去已有如此辉煌成就，将来与发掘等现代技术结合，前途无量。
一个月后，梁启超在清华研究院的同事王国维到中外人士聚集的北京历史社会学会演讲《宋代之金石学》，表彰宋人于古器物有“多方面之兴味”，元明清至今，“反有所不逮”，因此谓“金石学为有宋一代之学”。大约再过了一个月，梁启超在清华研究院的另一位同事李济结束田野调查回京，在课堂上把《中国考古学之过去及将来》这篇报告向同学们一摊，说道：“这是中国人的所谓考古学。”

梁启超

梁启超不是不懂从前国人的考古学与欧洲的考古学有何区别，否则他也不会先后把梁思成、梁思永送到美国去喝洋墨水。只是话既出口，有如覆水难收。当时不得不如此苦心孤诣，渐与背景割离。何况甲骨文金文的研究，经过王国维“二重证据法”论说的发挥，仿佛代表了更广泛的考古证据之前奏。这一思路流衍至今，便追踪到了清代朴学与考据方法：传统学人既然能够经由训诂小学而发现殷商的甲骨文字，意味着现代考古学的根本内容，其实就落脚在中国本土文化之中。

OpenAI 认为，能够超越人类智慧并压倒人类的计算机系统可能会在这个十年内被开发出来，“但超级智能的巨大力量也可能非常危险，可能导致人类丧失能力，甚至人类灭绝。”OpenAI 的既定目标一直是安全地开发人工通用智能，但这项技术目前还不存在。OpenAI 希望建立一个人工智能系统在不明确依赖人类的情况下，使其他机器与人类的价值观保持一致。为此，他们打算拿出 20% 的处理能力，并成立一个由其首席科学家领导的新部门，以某种方式防止未来机器危害人类。其设定的目标是在四年内解决人工智能和人类行为对齐的问题。

老王点评：那如何防止监管人工智能的人工智能叛变或合谋呢？从本质上来说，除非人工智能也具有自限性，就像大自然中的很多物种一样，能够和人类和其它生物形成共存条件，否则人工智能最终将是无法控制的。在这方面，我是悲观主义者。




Meta 向 Python 提议可选全局解释器锁功能

CPython 的全局解释器锁（GIL）阻止了多线程同时执行代码，这事实上阻碍了在多核 CPU 上提高 Python 代码的运行效率。Meta 正致力于推动 Python 项目采纳 PEP 703 提案，该提案将使全局解释器锁成为可选，并加入了必要的更改以确保解释器线程安全。Meta 还承诺，如果 PEP 703 提案被接受，它将在 2025 年前投入三个工程师年的人力，与核心团队合作去实现 PEP 703。

谷歌建议为人工智能更新 robots.txt 文件

人工智能公司大量使用了从互联网上刮取的内容进行训练，而很多内容是受版权保护的。谷歌建议网络和人工智能社区来讨论改进 robots.txt 标准，以应对人工智能刮取内容的需要。robots.txt 是一个由社区开发的网络标准，它诞生于近 30 年前，已被证明是网络发布者控制搜索引擎抓取其内容的一种简单而透明的方式。但 robots.txt 并不具有法律约束力，只是一种善意的指示。

                              <span>从 apt-add-repository 到“软件及更新”工具，这里有几种从 Ubuntu 移除软件仓库的方法。


你可以 在 Ubuntu 中添加外部仓库 来访问官方仓库中不可用的软件包。

例如，如果你 在 Ubuntu 中安装 Brave 浏览器，则将其仓库添加到你的系统中。如果你添加了一个 PPA，它也会添加为外部仓库。

当你不需要特定软件时，请将其删除。但是，外部仓库仍然存在。你还可以也应该将其删除以保持系统原始状态。

Ubuntu 可以让你轻松删除软件仓库。有不同的方法可以做到这一点：


使用 apt-add-repository 命令删除仓库

使用 GUI 删除仓库（对于桌面用户）

通过修改 /etc/apt/sources.list 文件的文件内容（针对专家）


但在此之前，如果你对这个概念不熟悉，我强烈建议你 熟悉包管理器的概念 和仓库。

方法 1、使用 apt 删除仓库🤖

你知道你还可以使用 apt 命令 来删除仓库吗？ 嗯，从技术上讲，它不是核心 apt 命令的一部分，但它的工作方式类似。

在处理外部仓库时，你可以使用 add-apt-repository 或者 apt-add-repository 命令（两者是同一命令）。

首先，使用以下命令列出添加的仓库：

apt-add-repository --list




完成后，你可以按所示方式使用带有 -r 标志的 apt-add-repository 命令来从列表中删除：

sudo apt-add-repository -r repo_name


例如，如果我想删除 yarn 仓库，我必须使用以下命令：

如果你想知道你的树莓派的性能如何，那么你可能需要一个树莓派的仪表盘。在本文中，我将演示如何快速构建一个按需监控仪表盘，以实时查看你的树莓派的 CPU 性能、内存和磁盘使用情况，并根据需要随时添加更多视图和操作。

如果你已经使用 Appsmith，你还可以直接导入 示例应用程序 并开始使用。

Appsmith

Appsmith 是一个开源的 低代码 应用构建工具，帮助开发人员轻松快速地构建内部应用，如仪表盘和管理面板。它是一个用于仪表盘的很好选择，并减少了传统编码方法所需的时间和复杂性。

在此示例的仪表盘中，我显示以下统计信息：


CPU

占用百分比

频率或时钟速度

计数

温度



内存

占用百分比

可用内存百分比

总内存

空闲内存



磁盘

磁盘使用百分比

绝对磁盘空间使用量

可用磁盘空间

总磁盘空间




创建一个端点

你需要一种从树莓派获取这些数据并传递给 Appsmith 的方法。psutil 是一个用于监控和分析的 Python 库，而 Flask-RESTful 是一个创建 REST API 的 Flask 扩展。

Appsmith 每隔几秒钟调用 REST API 以自动刷新数据，并以 JSON 对象作为响应，其中包含所有所需的统计信息，如下所示：

merge window for this release.


	Anyway, none of it looks hugely unusual. The biggest single mention
	probably goes to what wasn&#x27;t merged, with the bcachefs pull request
	resulting in a long thread (we didn&#x27;t hit a hundred emails yet, but
	it&#x27;s not far away).


The curious can read that long

                              <span>Has anyone gotten this working?
 I would think support would be built into the kernel by now, but I can&#x27;t locate it in menuconfig. 
 It&#x27;s an older Belkin usb with the rtl8192du chip. 
 I built everything rtl into the kernel with 6.3.10 and still can get the usb wifi to work.
 I even downloaded the rtl8192du source by Larry Finger and it still doesn&#x27;t sense it on boot.
 Thanks

                              <span>I have a directory that has permissions 755. The files inside it also have 755. However, other users can apparently rename the directory. But they can&#x27;t rename the files inside the directory nor can they delete the directory. So what gives with this strange behavior?

                              <span>An inode (aka index node) is a data structure used by Unix/Linux like filesystems in order to describe a filesystem object. Such an object could be a file or a directory. Every inode stores pointers to the disk block’s locations of the object’s data and metadata (https://www.bluematador.com/blog/what-is-an-inode-and-what-are-they-used-for). An illustration of that is shown below.
 Overall, the metadata contained in an inode is: file type (regular file/directory/symbolic link/block special file/character special file/etc), permissions, owner id, group id, size, last accessed time, last modified time, creation time and number of hard links (https://www.stackscale.com/blog/inodes-linux/).
 By using inodes the filesystem tracks all files/directories saved on disk. Also, by using inodes we can read any specific byte in the data of a file very effectively. We can see the number of total inodes per mounted filesystem using the command “df -i” (https://linux.die.net/man/1/df). Also, we can see the inode of a file/directory and other metadata of the file using the command “ls -i” (https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/ls.1.html) or “stat” (https://linux.die.net/man/1/stat). By the way, the “stat” command uses the “stat” syscall (https://linux.die.net/man/2/stat).
 Lastly, you can check out “struct inode” in the source code of the Linux kernel (https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v6.4.2/source/include/linux/fs.h#L612). Not all the points/links are directly connected to the data blocks, however I will elaborate on that in a future writeup.

                              <span>I work at a company where most of the developer machines run windows. I am among the few lucky devs that are allowed to have a Linux machine, where I am running Ubuntu 22.04 LTS. This setup mostly works great for me, however the MS Teams Client is a real painpoint. I can live without features present in the windows client like background blur/image, reactions in a call, and sharing single windows, but the horrible effect on system responsiveness that Teams produces is not bearable. When I&#x27;m in a call my machine becomes noticably less snappy, which does not happen for my colleagues with windows machines. Turning off my camera seems to help as does disabling incoming video. Every time I share screen my machine becomes very laggy and everything happens in slow motion. The internet is mostly along the lines of &quot;you will have to live with that&quot;, so: Does anyone here have similar experiences? Are there any tweaks that helped you resolve these issues? Any other directions I could look into?

 Last time I used Pinta it was disappointing and crashy. Is it better now? Any alternatives people would recommend in 2023 for an MSPaint equivalent for Linux which is ergonomic and stable? I have Gimp and it&#x27;s way too powerful for my purposes here.

                              <span>Finally we hit the mark: Linux Desktop Market Share
 Yes, yes, you all talked about this 30 years ago, Linux Desktop will never happen blah blah. Can you just rejoice for once?
 Edit: bros, my 5 year old daughter uses dwm on Devuan. She starts dwm by &#x27;exec startx&#x27; in the shell (obviously no graphical login manager). My 7 year old daughter is using vim key bindings in qutebrowser. We&#x27;re getting there. Relax.
 Edit2: my 5 year old logging into Devuan on a virtual console, no GUI login managers here lads: 5 year old logs in on the virtual console, she even has a relatively decent password. There&#x27;s hope!
 Edit3: 7 year old one working on her Guile skills: guile in virtual terminal, no C# here.

                              <span>I&#x27;ve been using Ubuntu for what seems like decades, but recently read complaints about the bloat, the snap package manager, etc.
 So when setting up a new computer to act as a Plex server and to run some slideshow software, I decided to try Debian 12 and XFCE - both widely described as stable, fast, polished, well-supported, etc.
 It was a total nightmare. Nothing was included. Every single basic step involved running into roadblocks, researching them, trying out various solutions and experimenting to get it working. And some things never worked.
 Wifi? - no driver for my wifi adapter. Have to install a driver, and it has missing dependencies.
 Bluetooth? - no bluetooth software. Have to figure it out too.
 Samba? - No samba client. No samba server. Have to set it up by editing conf files. Never got it working right.
 FTP? - No FTP. Have to set it up. More conf files. Never got it working right.
 Don&#x27;t want the computer to go to sleep? More conf files.
 Anyway ... after a few days of this I gave up, installed Ubuntu and got everything set up easily in a few hours.
 Nevertheless -- I take seriously people&#x27;s criticisms of the direction Ubuntu is going in. So my question is -- is there another distro out there that won&#x27;t have me tearing my hair out? That includes the basic functionality of a modern OS?
 I&#x27;m very distrustful of the distro &quot;round-ups&quot; online, because none of them gave me any indication of what a DIY nightmare Debian was.

 I am slightly new to linux. I have used it to make a stream link and some home theater pcs. But I have a chromebook I use as my secondary device. I am thinking about loading linux on but wanted to know what is available for drawing software right now I use clip studio and art flow. I also wanted to know a good distro that supports usi stylus and tablets since my chromebook is a convertible. thanks for any tips.

                              <span>谷歌再次重申“量子霸权”，声称制造了 70 个量子比特的量子超级计算机

“量子霸权” 是指量子计算机超越现有机器的一个里程碑点。四年前，谷歌制造了有 53 个量子比特的量子计算机，声称自己是第一家实现 “量子霸权” 的公司。据谷歌最新发表的论文，其新的量子计算机有 70 个量子比特，增加更多的量子比特可以成倍地提高量子计算机的功率，这意味着新机器比 2019 年的机器强大 2.41 亿倍！这台量子计算机可以瞬间完成目前最好的超级计算机 Frontier 需要 47 年才能完成的计算。研究人员还声称，他们最新的量子计算机比被视为该领域领导者的中国实验室演示的量子计算机更加强大。

该漏洞被称为 “StackRot”，CVSS 评分为 7.8，影响 Linux 6.1 至 6.4 版本，可以使用户在目标主机上获得提升的权限。迄今为止，没有证据表明该漏洞已经在野外被利用。StackRot 漏洞出现在内存管理子系统中，它几乎影响到所有的内核配置，只需要最小的权能capability即可触发。在 6 月 15 日负责任的披露之后，经过 Linux 内核团队两周努力，截至 2023 年 7 月 1日，它已经在新的内核版本中得到解决。

老王点评：无论如何，打补丁升级就是了。不过一般生产服务器都应该还没升级到 6.x 呢吧。




Reddit 对使用 NSFW 抗议策略的子区发出最后通牒

始于上个月中旬的 Reddit 子区 抗议，到现在仍有两千多个子区闭版。为了杜绝任何剩余的抗议活动，Reddit 正在向那些决定允许 NSFW（非工作安全）内容作为破坏公司广告业务的方式的子区发出“最后通牒”。Reddit 称，“这是对你的社区不准确的 NSFW 标签的最后通牒，这违反了《版主行为守则》第 2 条。你的子区历来不被认为是 NSFW，在我们目前的政策下也不属于。”如果不取消该标签，将导致参与这一活动的子区管理员们将被从管理团队中删除。

                              <span>这是一份可以用于发送/接收电子邮件并存储邮件的开源邮件服务器列表。


无论你使用何种 电子邮件客户端，使用像 Gmail、Proton Mail 和 Outlook 这样的电子邮件服务非常方便。

为了实现这一切，你利用的是它们的邮件服务器进行电子邮件传输。因此，你的电子邮件的安全性、可靠性和隐私性取决于他人。

但是，如果你希望拥有自己的电子邮件基础设施并控制数据，那么你需要一个开源电子邮件服务器来解决这个问题。

让我解释得更清楚一些，电子邮件服务器可以让你：


构建自己的邮件后端以存储电子邮件帐户

通过自托管来掌控安全性和可靠性

在你首选的服务器架构上进行托管

让你能够创建无限数量的帐户


当然，这些并不适用于终端用户。中小型企业的系统管理员和自托管者才能用得上这些软件。

考虑到你现在对开源电子邮件服务器的好处有了一定了解，下面是一些你可以找到的最佳选项：


📋 这个列表包括邮件服务器和一些能够构建/创建邮件服务器的解决方案。其中一些可能提供托管服务，而另一些可以进行自托管。


1、Postal

Postal 是一个功能丰富的邮件服务器，可供网站和服务器使用。它专为出站邮件而设计，没有邮箱管理功能。（LCTT 译注：出站邮件指外发邮件，入站邮件指接收邮件供邮件客户端收取。）

它的 文档 对于入门非常有帮助。你可以使用 Docker 在服务器上配置 Postal。

使用 Postal，你可以为多个组织创建邮件服务器/用户，访问出站/入站消息队列，实时的递交信息，并使用内置功能确保电子邮件能够传递。

主要亮点：


实时的递交信息

点击和打开追踪

专为出站邮件设计



🚧 维护和配置你的电子邮件服务器并非易事。只有在全面了解可靠地发送/接收电子邮件所需的一切情况下，才应继续设置邮件…</span>

                              <span>探索 Nobara 38 版本的新功能，该版本随 Fedora 38 一起发布。


基于 Fedora 38 的预期版本 Nobara 38 终于发布了，它带来了一系列用户友好的修复和功能增强。Nobara 是 Fedora Linux 的修改版本，旨在解决用户面临的常见问题，并提供开箱即用的顺滑的游戏、流媒体和内容创建体验。凭借一系列附加软件包和自定义功能，Nobara 38 将 Fedora 提升到了新的高度。

Nobara 38 中值得注意的改进之一是为视频调色软件 Davinci Resolve 实施了一个临时方案。当 Davinci Resolve 的安装程序从终端运行时，会提示用户执行一个向导，执行必要的操作以确保顺利运行。这包括将它的 glib2 库移动到一个备份文件夹中，详见官方 Davinci Resolve 论坛。



在游戏领域，Nobara 38 引入了 Payday 2 原生 Linux 版本的临时方案。鉴于 OpenGL 实现目前已损坏且对原生版本的官方支持已被放弃，该版本利用 zink 驱动程序来确保无缝游戏。据 GamingOnLinux 报道，这确保了 Linux 用户可以继续使用 Payday 2，不会出现任何问题。

此外，Nobara 38 合并了 Udev 规则来增强控制器支持。具体来说，添加了一条规则，强制对 045e:028e “Xbox 360” 控制器设备使用内核 xpad 驱动程序。这使得 GPD Win Max 2 和 GPD Win 4 等在报告为该设备的控制时，能够保持控制器兼容性，同时仍然允许安装可选的 xone/xpadneo 驱动程序以实现无线适配器，并改进对 Xbox One 控制器的蓝牙支持。

为了优化不同设备类型的性能，Nobara 38 引入了特定的 I/O 调度程序。NVMe 设…</span>

                              <span>林郁沁（章静绘）

在西方中国研究领域内，传统文人的转型研究和中国工业史少有交集。对近代文人士大夫的个案研究更多关注那些成为知名学者、文学家和政治家的近代著名人物，而近代中国工业史更关注西方技术引进与本土制度变迁之间的关系。哥伦比亚历史暨东亚系教授林郁沁的《美妆帝国蝴蝶牌：一部近代中国民间工业史》打破了这两个历史叙事之间的藩篱。在此之前，林教授最知名的著作是《施剑翘复仇案：民国时期公众同情的兴起与影响》。这部现代中国情感史的开创性作品在2007年获得了美国历史学会的费正清奖。《美妆帝国蝴蝶牌》延续了《施剑翘复仇案》的“微观史”角度，但题旨更宏大。林郁沁通过对陈蝶仙及其事业相关史料的细读，发掘了一位隐藏在鸳鸯蝴蝶派掌门人背后的成功企业家和知识传播者。林教授进一步以陈蝶仙从知名作家到工业大亨的经历为依据，提出了“民间工业主义”（vernacular industrialism）这个历史范畴。这本书围绕“民间工业主义”的讨论跳出了“发明-制造-扩散”的叙事窠臼，勾勒出一部从仿制、在地化到再仿制的去中心化的全球工业史。陈蝶仙正是一位善于利用自身优势和本地资源的仿制高手。这既是一部围绕着陈蝶仙的微观史，也是一次将文化史、科技史、经济史和经营史融为一炉的成功尝试。在《上海书评》的访谈中，林教授重点回顾了她是如何通过发掘陈蝶仙的故事来挑战传统历史叙事的。

                              <span>Is there a video you recommend that educates the history and intention of richard Stallman, the free software movement, and linux? I&#x27;m in the US but the population I am plan on educating to help less than 26 percent has access to the internet and the averge person makes 60 usd a month while a bag of rice is $55. Its pretty messed up there people are suffering. Knowing how to use linux and the history behind it can be life changing. (I just thought it as an opporunity to give back. This is not a get rich quick scheme).

 And now there is no software like it, i want task manager to show: 
 CPU,RAM,DiskUsage,InternetActivity and GPU, also it would be nice to show temperatures, vram usage and meaby something else.. Basicly like mangohud is showing all this things when im playing some game.
 And i dont understand why there is no software like that anymore..

                              <span>Hi,
 I&#x27;m building a pc for gaming and schoolwork.
 I would like to know what I should use.
 there aren&#x27;t a lot of games I want to play that aren&#x27;t supported on Linux.
 on the other hand, Microsoft PowerPoint is a must-have (or something like that).
 I also make little games in my free time.
 also, I don&#x27;t really know what distro to use.
 that&#x27;s pretty much all!

                              <span>In the following examples the vpn device name is tun0 (OpenVPN) and the VPN gateway is 172.21.23.172
 ​
 #1 - Install VPN on your Linux router (I&#x27;m using ipvanish w. openvpn)
 ​
 #2 - Route traffic using iptables
 ​
 sudo iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -o [VPN dev] -j MASQUERADE
 ​
 example:
 ​
 sudo iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -o tun0 -j MASQUERADE
 ​
 #3 - Configure routing tables (to ensure that all traffic is routed through the VPN)
 ​
 sudo ip route add default via [VPN ipv4 address] dev [VPN dev]
 ​
 example:
 ​
 sudo ip route add default via 172.21.23.172 dev tun0
 ​
 #4 - Check that devices on the network are indeed routing thru the VPN by running these commands:
 ​
 Windows: tracert 1.1.1.1
 Linux: traceroute 1.1.1.1
 ​
 you&#x27;re done!

                              <span>My laptop(8gb ram ) has mint cinnamon , and my pc ( also 8gb ram ) has mint xfce ( one of lightest linux distro out there ) , both has system freezing ( system freezes/ hangs and u must shutdown it directly to restore it) , tho it is more frequently in cinnamon. I thought this might be problem in mint but i asked one of friend who has ubuntu , blud has also 8gb and an 256gb ssd too but says he has this system freezing problem too!!!. Seems like linux makes your system faster is just a myth to me now , it is more slower actually.

                              <span>When will finally linux typography not suck? Seriously.. No matter if i use free fonts or copy Windows fonts, use slight or full hinting, use grayscale or RGBA hinting, it still sucks. Some fonts are better rendered than other, but generally it&#x27;s nowhere near to ClearType. I simply cannon browse the web in linux for prolonged time without eye fatigue or even small head pain. I am using linux like 20 years, things are getting better in many ways but font rendering is somehow stagnating. Is Hi-DPI ultimate solution? Should i abandon standard DPI displays and rather go with 200% DPI? What are your opinions on this topic?

I know that some of them can be very taxing for my device. So can anyone help me figure out which way will be best for my device and easy to use.

                              <span>I am a 24 hours long linux user, I installed debian 12/ Gnome 43.4 with wayland.
 My first problem to tackle is the scrolling speed of the touchpad, it&#x27;s super fast.
 The solutions I found are for libinput (using libinput-config), but it seems that it isn&#x27;t installed.
 When I run &#x60;sudo libinput list-devices&#x60; I get the response &#x60;sudo: libinput: command not found&#x60;.
 If I don&#x27;t have libinput, what do I have? How can I found out what my distro is using instead?
 Is there any way that a good book can guide me through the debian in deepth?

                              <span>So, I installed Ubuntu 2-3 weeks ago as a dual-boot with my Windows 10 Pro. It worked fine for 2-3 days then my brother messed up something &amp; I simply first deleted the GRUB for Ubuntu using &#x27;bcdedit delete&#x27; command &amp; then cleared the disks in order to delete Ubuntu from my system.
 But when I was re-installing it showed my where it asks like where do I need to install, it showed me like &#x27;Install alongside other OS&#x27; but when the first time I tried dual-boot it was just like &#x27;Install alongside Windows 10&#x27;. So, it shows the previous OS doesn&#x27;t remove 100%. That didn&#x27;t a problem anyways, I simply re-installed it and it&#x27;s working fine now since then.
 But now I want to install it on my SSD &amp; HDD to utilize my SSD. Now, it&#x27;s installed on my HDD which kinda sucks, it literally takes 4-5 min to boot. So, thinking to re-install it again.
 So, like is it ok to perform that many re-installations? Doesn&#x27;t it affect my system performance? Also, is there any more efficient way to remove Linux properly than I opt previously?
 Any help is appreciated, thanks!

                              <span>this. might sound incredibly stupid but Linus gave a talk many years ago and discussed that he doesn&#x27;t like fooling around with Linux and is much more interested in the kernel and not much else. he brought up that he reinstalls his OS a couple times a year. I&#x27;m really just curious how easy it is to maintain all your settings and files by doing this. I guess it could work easily in the cloud as all your data syncs there and you can access it from any device. but he gave this talk before the cloud was as big as it is now. so did he imply that he just stored all his files on an external drive/network and he goes in once a month or once a quarter and nukes his machine and reinstalls from scratch? I&#x27;m pretty new to linux but I want to make sure I understand the file structure. thanks in advance.

                              <span>I know that this is won&#x27;t ever actually happen because if Linux did start to become &quot;bad&quot; (whatever that means) people would just fork it. However, this is just a hypothetical question for people think about and share their thoughts on it.
 So what would you do if this suddenly happened? Have you thought about an alternative? If so, what is it and why?
 As a somewhat separate question, I&#x27;m also curious to know if you guys think we could make FreeBSD just as usable as Linux if enough people moved to it. Wouldn&#x27;t that solve a lot of the issues that we have in our community? Such as having to make different binaries for different distros and so on?
 Curious to hear your thoughts!

只要对游戏玩家们提到 “Denuvo” 这个名字，相信就能立即看到他们强烈的反应。关于 Denuvo 的报道下面的评论是大量对他们的 DRM 反盗版技术的抱怨。该公司的电子游戏首席运营官在一次采访中强调，他认为 Denuvo 是整个游戏界的积极力量。他说：“反盗版技术对游戏发行商有利，（但也）对玩家有利，因为它保护了（发行商）的投资，这意味着发行商可以投资于下一个游戏。……无论人们是否愿意相信，我们都是游戏玩家，我们热爱游戏，我们热爱成为游戏的一部分，我们开发技术的目的是为了让这个行业变得更好、更强大。”

老王点评：我要是说 Denuvo 臭名昭著，不过分吧。




旧金山的抗议者用交通锥桶使自动驾驶出租车失效

在旧金山，一群反对自动驾驶出租车的人发现，他们可以通过在车辆的引擎盖上放置一个交通锥桶来禁用 Cruise 和 Waymo 自动驾驶出租车。该组织称这是一种抗议自动驾驶出租车服务在该市蔓延的形式，它似乎得到了居民的支持，他们对这些车辆的故障和阻塞交通感到厌烦。加州公用事业委员会计划于 7 月中旬批准扩大旧金山的自动驾驶出租车数量。

老王点评：这些交通锥桶“真正”发挥了阻挡汽车的作用，但是，真能阻挡自动驾驶技术的发展吗？

                              <span>经过大约 16 年的演变，云计算已经成为一种几乎所有网民都在使用的技术。它可以作为一种服务，用于满足各类企业和消费者的需求。因此，在云计算中正在使用多种服务架构，旨在根据最新的需求来定制所需技术。本文就如今使用的所有服务架构，提供一份完全指南。


尽管在全球范围内建立互相协同的计算机网络的构想在 20 世纪 60 年代初就提出了，但直到 2006 年，谷歌的首席执行官 埃里克·施密特Eric Schmidt 在当时的背景下引入了“云计算cloud computing”一词，这种构想才成为一种正式的概念。

云计算可以简单理解为遍布于世界各地的远程服务器网络，通过互联网共享数据和协同工作，从而为企业和消费者提供服务。虽然这样的定义比较武断，但它包含了云计算背后的核心思想。促成这项技术发展的主要因素是对“数据粘性”的需求，就是令数据更容易被各种设备访问，同时也要减少数据丢失的风险。如果用户甲只在一台服务器上保存了数据，对于用户甲来说，只要有一台服务器中断，数据就很有可能永久性丢失。这种做法无异于“把所有鸡蛋放在同一个篮子里”，从来都不是一个好办法，特别是当你在处理对公司和消费者具有重要意义的数据时。但如果你在多台服务器上备份了用户甲的数据，将有两个主要好处：其一，即使一台服务器中断，用户甲仍然可以正常获取数据；其二，云服务可以从负荷最小的、离他最近的那台正常运作的服务器获取数据。这使用户甲可以在不同设备上更快、更容易地获取数据。

历经大约 16 年的发展，云计算从起初只是一种用于备份图片的工具，变为了互联网的骨干。如今几乎所有的应用，从 Office 到 Asana 以及 Todolist，都利用云计算来实现实时访问和数据共享。几乎任意一款你能想像到的应用都在使用云计算。从 Gmail 和 YouTube，到Instagram，一切都使用云计算，以提供快速、便捷、可…</span>

有一类人的生活状态是这样的：每天清晨闹钟响前已经醒来，假日就算关了闹钟也无法睡到自然醒；还没起床就在手机上查工作邮件，睡觉之前也要回复了工作邮件才安心；上班时忙着处理各种事情，水不敢喝怕上厕所，但咖啡提神还是要灌几杯下肚；病了不敢请假，不舒服只能吃止痛药缓解；吃饭狼吞虎咽风卷残云几分钟搞定；下班路上不断刷社交媒体生怕遗漏各种新闻动态；擅长多任务处理（multitasking），但五分钟全心全意都没法给生命中最重要的人；一停步就觉得对不起全世界，想休息又觉得自己不值得；虽然新年愿望是躺平躺赢，但好不容易做完手上一件事之后，又开始计划下一件，心中窃喜：忙完这一阵，又可以忙下一阵了！
美国著名记者、公共演讲家、美国公共电视网（PBS）主持瑟列丝特·海德利（Celeste Headlee）2020年出版的畅销书《失控的努力文化》开头描写的就是过度工作、做得太多、活得太少的现代社会芸芸众生：
周日晚上我们还在回复工作邮件。我们不停阅读各种文章希望找到提升脑力增加效率的方法。我们把自己的照片剪切妥当用上滤镜才发上社交媒体让大家赞好。看到有趣的文章我们也只读最前面的几段，因为根本没时间看完。我们加班加点超时工作，压力山大，总是不满，不断追求越来越高的目标。我们是效率邪教的成员，我们正用生产力来杀害自己。
 “效率邪教组织”（the cult of efficiency）的说法来自英国哲学家罗素。此书导言首先引用了罗素散文《赞美闲暇》（In Praise of Idleness）中的这段话：
有人会这样说，稍事闲暇虽然令人愉悦，但如果人们每天二十…</span>

                              <span>近期，金融管理部门对蚂蚁集团及旗下机构处以罚款（含没收违法所得）71.23亿元，要求蚂蚁集团关停违规开展的“相互宝”业务，并依法补偿消费者利益。


消息称，近年来，金融管理部门坚持发展和规范并重，建立健全平台经济治理体系，出台一系列制度办法，初步形成平台企业金融业务发展与监管制度框架，促进平台经济规范健康发展。2020年11月以来，从依法加强监管和有效防范风险的角度出发，金融管理部门督促指导蚂蚁集团、腾讯集团等大型平台企业全面整改金融活动中存在的违法违规问题。目前，平台企业金融业务存在的大部分突出问题已完成整改。金融管理部门工作重点从推动平台企业金融业务的集中整改转入常态化监管。


近期，针对蚂蚁集团及旗下机构过往年度在公司治理、金融消费者保护、参与银行保险机构业务活动、从事支付结算业务、履行反洗钱义务和开展基金销售业务等方面存在的违法违规行为，金融管理部门依据《中国人民银行法》《反洗钱法》《银行业监督管理法》《保险法》《证券投资基金法》《消费者权益保护法》等，对蚂蚁集团及旗下机构处以罚款（含没收违法所得）71.23亿元。要求蚂蚁集团关停违规开展的“相互宝”业务，并依法补偿消费者利益。此外，针对以往执法检查中发现的问题，金融管理部门近期也对邮储银行、平安银行、人保财险和财付通公司等实施了行政处罚。


7月7日，国家金融监督管理总局网站发布行政处罚信息公开表，对蚂蚁科技集团股份有限公司(下称蚂蚁科技集团)罚没合计超37亿元。


罚单显示，蚂蚁科技集团主要违法违规事实有两条：


一是侵害消费者合法权益。包括：存在引人误解的金融营销宣传行为，侵害消费者知情权；未向部分客户群体明示还款要求；未按规定处理部分消费者个人信息。


二是违规参与银行保险机构业务活动。包括：违规参与保险代理、保险经纪业务；违规参与销售个人养老保障管理产品、银行理财产品、互联网存款产品。


根据《中华人民共和国银行业监督管理法》第十九条、第四十四条，《中华人民共和国保险法》第六条、第一百一十九条、第一百五十九条，《中华人民共和国消费者权益保护法》第十四条、第十六条、第二十条、第二十六条、第二十九条、第五十六条等规定，国家金融监督管理总局决定，对蚂蚁科技集团没收违法所得112977.62万元，罚款263270.44万元，罚没合计376248.06万元。


作出处罚决定的日期为2023年7月7日。


蚂蚁集团回应被罚71.23亿元：自2020年以来，蚂蚁集团在金融管理部门指导下积极推进各项整改，目前已完成相关整改事项。今天，蚂蚁集团收到金融管理部门行政处罚决定书，我们对此诚恳接受、坚决服从，并将进一步夯实合规治理水平。未来，蚂蚁集团将恪守使命与初心，坚持守正创新，继续增强科技研发能力，努力为实体经济尤其是小微群体做好服务并创造更大价值。</span>

                              <span>Is it me or Linux (any distro) runs better and smoother with the iGPU than with Nvidia? I have an i5 9th gen and RTX 3060 Ti and I think it runs better without the Nvidia card.

                              <span>Long story short, steam will stop working with windows 7. So I will be giving linux a try.
 I don&#x27;t know anything about it. But life is about learning new things.
 From the very short research Iv&#x27;e done, I think I will be going with the arch based system Manjaro.
 A couple questions.
 What do I need to know before I wipe my drive and make the journey to rebuilding my os.
 Is it similar to formatting a hard drive and installing a windows os? Just use a flashdrive with Manjaro?
 I only have 1 hard drive at the moment.
  
Drivers.
  
Should I have at least my ethernet drivers loaded onto a flash drive ready to go? I remember last time with a windows install I didn&#x27;t have them, and had to use another computer to aqquir them and load them in.
 Does the os have features that locate drivers automaticly? Or do I have to search them manually?
  
I have 32 gigs of ram. and windows 7 locked away 16 gigs because it wasn&#x27;t the premium edition. Will linux free my ram and allow me to use it as intended?
  
Anything else a first time user should know off the bat?

                              <span>Hello,
 I find myself questioning whether using GUI is actually a good thing. I&#x27;ve seen people online making videos about how tiling window managers are undermining your productivity, and that things like it are just a distraction. A regular person is/should incapable of multitasking when they are focussed on let&#x27;s say, programming.
 There&#x27;s further discussions to be had about stripping any shell/terminal of syntax highlighting, as well as code syntax highlighting, and having everything be the same color.
 I&#x27;m mainly concerned with this as I am trying to find a way to use linux to train myself to become a better programmer, and to function in a development environment where GUIless is the standard.
 Another frequent problem is that GUI adjacent stuff always sparks a lot of conversation and I want to ideally have an environment that is as neutral and unexpressive as possible, because I don&#x27;t want any slight hint of expression of personality ruining my job prospects. For this reason I always stick to default color themes and fonts, because these choices were made for me, and therefore by not changing them I am not expressing any opinion. My job is to do my job.
 How is this looked upon in industries where people use linux distros in production? I really need to commit to something that is objectively as non-offensive as possible. I do not want to get yelled at.
 I hope someone can share some insight, and recommend a distro that&#x27;s focussed on GUIless, probably.

So I think that Steam might drop Windows support in favour of Linux if that happened.
 Do you think any other apps or games would drop Windows support in favour of Linux? Or do you think the rest would just take the loss and pay Microsoft a cut of their revenue?

                              <span>Hey All, 
 I have a bunch of older thin clients that have a 2GB storage and want to find a dist that I can use to install that has RDP or browser support so we can give this hardware new life. we have a few hundred of these thin clients and want to make use of them again. 
 i suppose another way might be PXE now that i think about it. though i ll have to check if they have PXE support or a small EFI or Micro OS to proxy the PXE support. 
 Any ideas to whats out there that could solve this? i like the rdp client in ubuntu but ubu requires more than 2gb storage to install.

 I&#x27;ll start with mine:
 Ubuntu 18.04 LTS (first ever) -&gt; Linux Mint 20.2 -&gt; Ubuntu 20.04 LTS -&gt; Manjaro 20.1 -&gt; Arch -&gt; Debian 11-&gt; Linux Mint 21 -&gt; MXLinux 21.3 -&gt; Linux Mint (current, 21.1).

 Is there a GUI for xrandr that includes all the bells and whistles? 
 Or do I just need to bite the bullet and read the man page? :(

                              <span>ok, before you jump down my throat r/findmeadistro is private.
 I know about puppy linux, but is there another cut down linux distro that can give a browswer and modern c++ compiler to an old pc? Its like a pentium 3 that ran windows 98. It works fine, so i aint throwing it out, I just wanted to revive it.
 IF it can boot into ram to avoid running on a hard disk, even better

I have been considering setting it up as a server, and submitting jobs to it, or alternatively some sort of remote access.

                              <span>Hi, I know this should be posted into r/linuxquestions, but I cannot post into the sub unless I am verified, and admin aren&#x27;t approving so here I am .
 Is it possible to turn on my monitor when I power on my desktop ? My monitor is a LG 27GP850-B, connected over displayport in order to get to 165Hz, which apparently HDMI 2.0 cannot do. The monitor has upstream and downstream USB 3.0 ports, and I&#x27;m running a 3080ti.
 Thanks in advance !

I am able to spin up the VMs using Kubernetes pods and expose them via an ingress resource.
 However, what I can&#x27;t seem to implement or wrap my head around is how killercoda or katacoda (now deprecated) have instructions on the left side of the browser execute commands on the terminal access as seen in the picture attached
 A sample implementation of issuing instructions from the left to the terminal
 The closest I could get is a markdown configuration of where the instructions are coming from such as the below:

to live up to its early hype,
this Digital
Antiquarian article covers the history of rogue-like games in great
detail.


	This brings us back around to a statement I made at the outset:
	that roguelikes are the exception that proves the rule of
	open-source game development — and just possibly of open-source
	software development in general. The cast of thousands who
	contribute to them do so in order to make exactly the games that
	they want to play, which in the abstract is the best of all
	possible reasons to make a game. The experience they end up with
	is, unsurprisingly, much like high-wire programming at its most
	advanced, presenting players with an immense, multi-faceted system
	to be explored and mastered.</span>

                              <span>Over the years, the kernel has developed a number of deferred-execution
mechanisms to take care of work that cannot be done immediately.  For many
(or most) needs, the workqueue
subsystem is the tool that developers reach for first.  Workqueues
took their current form over a dozen years
ago, but that does not mean that there are not improvements to be made.
Two sets of patches from Tejun Heo show the pressures being felt by the
workqueue subsystem and the solutions that are being tried — with varying
degrees of success.</span>

                              <span>5G 并没有影响飞行安全

2021 年末，就在 Verizon 计划在其持有的新 C 波段频谱上开通 5G 网络之前，美国航空业开展了一场大型公关活动，以 阻止 该网络的推出。航空业认为 5G 频段会对飞机上的高度计形成“重大干扰”，这种高度计对于飞机在雨天和其他可能影响能见度的情况下安全着陆至关重要。一些国际航空公司开始 减少 飞往美国的航班，航空业认为这甚至会导致“国家的商业陷入停滞”。这场对峙在去年夏天达到了高峰。经过公开的辩论后，Verizon 和 AT&amp;T 同意将他们在一些机场附近的 5G 推广工作推迟到 7 月 1 日，以使航空业有时间将一些飞机高度计更新为不会受到 5G 影响的高度计。而到了最后期限 7 月 1 日，仅达美航空就预计约还有 190 架飞机需要加装新高度计。但这一天就这样悄然过去了，一家航班追踪公司称并没有发生“任何专门与 5G 有关的干扰”。

法官裁定表情符号 👍 表示签署合同

一位谷物买家在 2021 年 3 月向一位农民发送了一条短信，称该公司希望购买 86 吨亚麻，在秋季交付。双方后来通了电话，买家发来一张 11 月交付亚麻的合同图片，还说 “请确认亚麻合同”。这位农民发回了一个竖起大拇指（👍）的表情符号。但当 11 月到来时，亚麻并没有交付，而且价格已经上涨。一位加拿大法官说，“（竖起大拇指）表情符号是一种非传统的文件‘签名’方式，但在这种情况下，这是一种传达‘签名’的两个目的的有效方式”，因此裁定农民违反了合同，并命令农民支付超过 82,000 美元违约金。农民辩称，这个表情符号只表明他在短信中收到了合同。

Threads 不到 24 小时内突破 3000 万注册用户

Meta 的新 Twitter 竞争对手 Threads 在 AppStore 上线的头两个小时就超过了 200 万注册人数，并且没有放缓的迹象。在前 7 个小时突破 1000 万注册人数后，又在不到 24 小时内达到 3000 万注册人数。Threads 现在也是最快突破 100 万用户大关的应用，打破了 ChatGPT 的记录。

                              <span>据北京市市场监督管理局网站，因违反《中华人民共和国广告法》第八条第一款，苹果电子产品商贸(北京)有限公司被罚款3万元，处罚机关为北京市东城区市场监督管理局。这是该公司今年收到的第三张罚单，处罚依据均为广告法相关规定，三次罚款总额达到33万。


北京市市场监督管理局披露的处罚详情显示，苹果“iPhone年年焕新计划”主页页面为其推出的iPhone年年焕新计划发布广告。广告中有“升级到新款iPhone，轻轻松松”“如欲加入iPhone年年焕新计划，只需购买指定新款iPhone，并在同一笔交易中加购AppleCare+服务计划，即可加入其中”等内容。 经调查，年年焕新计划为苹果推出的可升级iPhone，并提供AppleCare+服务的保障计划。在实际执行中，iPhone年年焕新计划不可与商务折扣同享。苹果将上述限制条件写于跳转页面的“参与iPhone年年焕新计划，你即同意下述条款与条件”条款中，未在上述主页广告中予以标明。 上述广告内容由苹果自行编辑制作及上传发布，可追溯的发布日期为2020年10月23日。2021年8月底，苹果对上述内容予以修改完善。


在这张罚单之前，苹果电子产品商贸(北京)有限公司在5月份连续收到了两张罚单。


5月4日，苹果电子产品商贸(北京)有限公司因违反《中华人民共和国反不正当竞争法》第九条第一款被罚10万，此次处罚涉及到的产品是Apple watch series3(蜂窝网络版)手表。


处罚详情显示，2017年9月当事人在其官方网站宣传其销售的Apple watch series3(蜂窝网络版)手表产品的内置蜂窝网络功能时宣称“支持的运营商 中国移动今年稍后推出 中国电信今年稍后推出 中国联通今年稍后推出”。2017年12月13日因通信运营商未能为当事人销售的Apple watch series3(蜂窝网络版)手表产品的内置蜂窝网络功能提供技术支持，当事人将蜂窝网络服务推出的时间由“今年稍后推出”改为“2018年推出”。 当事人销售的Apple watch series3(蜂窝网络版)手表产品的“内置蜂窝网络功能”必须在通信运营商的技术支持下才可以使用。当事人与中国移动、中国联通、中国电信三家通信运营商签订的相关协议中并未约定运营商为其销售的Apple watch series3(蜂窝网络版)手表产品内置蜂窝网络服务提供技术支持的具体时间;根据当事人提交的上述合同，三家通信运营商仅向当事人承诺了其与其他客户的同等权利。 当事人称根据其与该三家通信运营商的协议以及定期沟通作出“合理的商业预计”即三家运营商应于2017年为当事人销售的Apple watch series3的内置蜂窝网络功能提供支持，将“今年稍后推出”的内容在其官方网站对外进行宣传。当事人在2017年12月13日又因“运营商无法实现我们在官网上所预测的服务开通时间后，我们及时更新了官网信息”，将上述宣传介绍内容改为“2018年推出”。 结合所取得的证据，我局认定当事人的上述宣传介绍内容没有依据。当事人上述使用没有依据的“合理的商业预期”对外进行宣传的行为引发消费者举报。


5月24日，苹果电子产品商贸(北京)有限公司因为违反《中华人民共和国广告法》(2018)第五十五条第一款被处罚20万元，这次涉及到的产品是Macbook Air。


处罚详情显示，2022年2月14日，执法人员依据举报线索浏览当事人上述网站，发现其通过上述网站为其销售的Macbook Air产品发布广告，广告使用了“8核中央处理器 干活够爽快，用电省得狠。”“M1芯片拥有我们迄今打造的最快的中央处理器。”等内容，并在页面右上角有“”字样。实际上，案发时M1芯片配备的中央处理器并非为苹果公司打造的最快的。该公司在配备M1芯片的Macbook Air和配备M1 Pro和M1 Max芯片的MacBook Pro同时销售的情况下，在Macbook Air产品广告中宣称其搭载的M1芯片“拥有我们迄今打造的最快的中央处理器。”内容与事实不符。 上述广告内容由当事人自行编辑制作及上传发布，广告费用无法核算。

                              <span>《驶向现代性：私家车与当代中国的中产阶级》，张珺著，席煦译，广东人民出版社｜万有引力，2023年3月出版，288页，78.00元

《驶向现代性：私家车与当代中国的中产阶级》是一本极其迷人的有关汽车与中产阶级关联的社会科学专著，用作者的表述是机动车机制与中产的交叉点。理解机动车机制成为这本书构建中产叙事的关键。二十二万字描述聚焦机动车机制的中产叙事，围绕社会、家庭、轿车市场、素质话语、车牌拍卖和泊车这六个方面，实现中产阶级的具体化。《驶向现代化》提出机动车机制（automotive regime）这一核心概念，强调automobile（汽车）并不都是流动的，它是社会与技术二者聚合的产物，囊括了“人类、机械、空间（包括道路及其他）、代理人、监管机构，还有大量的相关行业及基础设施要素”。
我曾经在《民俗研究》发表过一篇文章（《中产阶层“不可统计”的生活经验——民族志书写城市的新路径和可能性》，2018年第6期），探讨中产阶级经验研究的成就和动态。我将这些经验研究分为三个类别：一、产权、空间的私有化，二、自我管理与规训，三、母职、照料与教育。这样的分类虽然尽可能涵盖中产阶级田野调查涉及的不同方面，不过有一个问题是仍旧将作为生活方式的中产阶级经验放在相互区别的主题单元，而割裂了生活方式的整体性。那时我还没有了解到张珺的汽车研究，虽然了解姗姗来迟，不过我会毫不犹豫地将《驶向现代化》串联起这三个分类，依靠机动车机制，它将产权、空间、素质话语与母职等多重经验维度串联起来、带动起来，这种贯通和整合效应接近机动车体制的含义。作者用汽车贯穿三大分类框架的做法，也让我回想起研究生同学因为带孩子不定期去医院打针而痛下决心学车，购买第二辆车，这样她就可以不用麻烦丈夫，自己开车带孩子“履行母职”。
由汽车引发的多重体制触角的碰撞并非均是井然有序的，有即兴性和滞后性的成分，即突发情况发生之后的管理反应。…</span>

 As in, like, does having a more secure encryption method cause writing/reading speeds to be slower for the drive?

                              <span>Greetings, I am an extreme noob with only enough knowledge to be dangerous. I followed a guide to install and run Foundry VTT on my Amazon EC2 instance and it&#x27;s worked for years, recently updated to latest version and I&#x27;m unable to resolve the following issue I get when trying to access the foundry vtt server file directly.
 /foundry/foundryvtt: error while loading shared libraries: libatk-1.0.so.0: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory 
 All I&#x27;m doing is typing /foundry/foundryvtt into my console and getting that error, I assume that means I&#x27;m trying to start it.
 I&#x27;ve tried installing the library / package it refers to using sudo yum install libatk-1.0.so.0 and get 
 Loaded plugins: extras_suggestions, langpacks, priorities, update-motd amzn2-core | 3.7 kB 00:00:00 Package atk-2.22.0-3.amzn2.0.2.i686 already installed and latest version Nothing to do 
 Not sure what to do to resolve. I&#x27;ve far exhausted my ability to google lol. Any help would be appreciated!

                              <span>I&#x27;d like to use Posix message queues for inter-process communication between some of my user desktop programs. I think it would be a better solution that sockets, for a few reasons, but the problem I am currently facing is that it appears that only root can create the queues, and that might be a show-stopper for me.
 My code is basically: 
 struct mq_attr attr; attr.mq_curmsgs &#x3D; 0; attr.mq_maxmsg &#x3D; 2; attr.mq_msgsize &#x3D; 1024; attr.mq_flags &#x3D; 0; oflag &#x3D; O_RDONLY; /* Open the queue, and create it if the sending process hasn&#x27;t * already created it. */ mqfd &#x3D; mq_open( &quot;/test_queue&quot;, oflag, 0777, &amp;attr ); if (mqfd &#x3D;&#x3D; -1) { perror(&quot;mq_open failure from main&quot;); exit(0); }; 
 But when I run it as a user, I get:
 &quot;mq_open failure from main: Permission denied&quot; 
 I just read the man pages for mq_open and for mq_overview and I didn&#x27;t notice an explanation for this, does anyone have experience with Posix message queues on Linux?

                              <span>Hello guys. I was looking for a notes app on Linux. I found out Standard Notes, but I checked on their website and there are 2 versions: free very limited and paid with all features. Since it&#x27;s open source, how is it possible to be paid? If I build it myself from the source code, will I could get all the features for free or I still have to pay. I&#x27;m new in programming. I don&#x27;t need their cloud, because, at the moment, I&#x27;m looking only for offline features. In the feature, I&#x27;d like to use it with sync services on Android, but I could use google drive (since the app saves notes in encrypted format).
 Thanks in advance

                              <span>Yesterday I was trying to download a rather large ISO file (around 5 GB). I have about 1.5GB of free space in my home directory, but it shouldn&#x27;t matter since I was sending the ISO to an external drive. The download process would eventually stall, I got a &quot;disk is full&quot; warning, and my home directory was at 100%... what can be happening?
 Edit: I am using Chrome to download such file, but it also happens with Firefox.
 Thanks.

                              <span>Hi,
 I got in a (very brief) argument with a friend on whether it&#x27;s worth learning PERL since there&#x27;s Python. I couldn&#x27;t make a good argument other than: PERL was designed for text processing so it&#x27;s good at it, because I haven&#x27;t and don&#x27;t use PERL.
 As a sysadmin or otherwise, under what conditions would you pick PERL over Python, assuming you&#x27;re adept at both?

 Sometimes you encounter files generated in Windows like a bolt out of the blue.
 &#x27;--universal-newline&#x27; of pyvipe might save you.
 Check the video here: https://www.reddit.com/r/coolgithubprojects/comments/14scz7k/pyvipe_020_unique_option_universalnewline/
 repo: https://github.com/Constantin1489/pyvipe
 install: &#x60;pip install pyvipe&#x60;
 command: &#x60;vipe&#x60;
 ​
 The original vipe of moreutils is already perfect! I recommend moreutils. It has been a trusted tool for a long time.
 But if you need vipe but you have GNU parallel, also are annoyed to remove moreutils parallel symlink and add a symlink to GNU&#x27;s again, OR you need to use it temporarily, OR any restriction in your environment but pip or python are allowed, then copy pyvipe script or install pyvipe.
 Or if you are annoyed with installing &#x60;dnf --enablerepo&#x3D;crb install perl-IPC-Run&#x60; before installing vipe of moreutils, use mine.

                              <span>I am looking for a symbol or a character that you could add to a command to make it refresh every second or so. I&#x27;ve used this before, but I forgot how to do it exactly. For example you can do docker ps X and this will not stop once the containers are listed, but will continue to display and it will refresh. And X is the thing that I am looking for. I think it was universal and you could also do for example ls X or git status, very similar to how tail -f works. If someone knows how this can be done it will be very helpful. Thanks

                              <span>I use pushd/popd often, however I felt there was something lacking from the functionality offered by those commands, so I decided to build ppd.
 ppd allows you to perform the following actions on a directory stack:
  
list directories in the stack
 push directories to the stack
 pop directories from the stack
 navigate to directories in the stack
 add directories to the stack
 remove directories from the stack
 clear directories from the stack
  
You can find it on GitHub:

 https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/37q8bc/have_anybody_tried_putting_linux_on_these_cheap/
 And the information after this seems a bit spread over the web.
 Does anyone happen to have contemporary insight as to whether some distros ever stabilized for Mini PCs such as the Sunchip CX-W8?

                              <span>The kernel thread “inet_frag_wq” is created using a workqueue (https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v6.2-rc1/source/net/ipv4/inet_fragment.c#L211), we could have guessed it based on a workqueue do to the “wq” suffix. It is used for fragment management of IP packets. Thus the goal of “inet_frag_wq” is to reassemble fragmented IPv4/IPv6 packets (https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v6.2-rc1/source/net/ipv4/inet_fragment.c#L6).
 Overall, the goal of IP fragmentation is to split packets into smaller chunks in order to allow them to meet the MTU (Maximum Transmission Unit) requirement of a specific network. There is an implementation difference between IP fragmentation in IPv4 and IPv6. On IPv4 the information needed for fragmentation is part of the IPv4 header which in IPv6 there is a specific “Fragmentation Header” (https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/ipv6-fragmentation-header/). An illustration of the flow is shown in the diagram below both for IPv4 and IPv6.
 Thus, “inet_frag_wq” is relevant when a fragmented IP packet arrives at a specific system. The OS stores the fragmented packets in a queue and reassembles them before they are passing the data to the upper layers of the network stack. The fragment queue is represented by &quot;struct inet_frag_queue&quot; (https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v6.2-rc1/source/include/net/inet_frag.h#L66). 
 Moreover, we can see in the source code the function “ip_frag_reasm” which is responsible for building a new IP datagram from all of its fragments (https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v6.2-rc1/source/net/ipv4/ip_fragment.c#L411).

                              <span>I&#x27;m in the process of trying to organize my tools and I&#x27;m looking for a tool tracking software I can use to keep track of what tools I have, and where I&#x27;ve put them. For example, I know I&#x27;ve got a pipe cutter, but I can&#x27;t find it because the last time I used it I put it away in this toolbox instead of that one. The next time I go looking for the pipe cutter, I might spend an hour looking for it or just give up and borrow/buy a new one. This is in an effort to de-clutter and organize my work area(s). 
 I would prefer something other than a spreadsheet.
 Preferably I would like to be able to barcode label my stuff, so when I&#x27;m working on a project, I can scan the barcode, and it will tell me where I am supposed to put the tool away. Also, something that I can search &quot;Screwdriver&quot; and it will show me list of all my screwdrivers, where they are (or are at least supposed to be), and maybe have a picture.
 Most of the software programs/solutions I&#x27;ve been able to find are geared more towards business inventory that is to be sold/shipped/replenished/...etc. I don&#x27;t need (or really want) a cloud solution, and I definitely don&#x27;t want a subscription service - or really anything I have to pay for.
 Any suggestions? Anybody found a solution that works for them?
 Thanks!

                              <span>我们评测了最新的 SparkyLinux 7 “Orion Belt”，它带来了最新、最好的 Debian 12 软件包。


SparkyLinux 是著名的基于 Debian 的桌面 Linux 发行版，又推出了它的最新版本 SparkyLinux 7 “Orion Belt”。自 SparkyLinux 6.0 以来，经过近两年的开发，这个主要版本已经发布。这个备受期待的版本结合了 Debian 12 的稳定性优势和 SparkyLinux 的尖端功能，承诺提供卓越的用户体验。

让我们深入研究这个主要版本的细节，并了解它的性能和其他发行版方面。

SparkyLinux 7 “Orion Belt”

核心更新

SparkyLinux 以其多样化的桌面风格而脱颖而出，确保适合每个用户。无论你喜欢视觉上令人惊叹的 KDE Plasma、轻量级 LXQt、经典 MATE、可定制的 Xfce 还是简约的 Openbox，SparkyLinux 7 都提供了令人印象深刻的选择，以满足各种喜好和要求。

SparkyLinux 7 的核心是 Debian 12 “Bookworm”，为稳定性和可靠性提供了坚实的基础。Debian 12 几天前发布，作为该项目的一个重要里程碑，它是历史上最好的 Debian 版本之一。也就是说，在 SparkyLinux 7 中，用户可以期望从 Debian “Bookworm” 和 Sparky “Orion Belt” 仓库更新所有软件包，确保最新的软件版本随时可用。

此版本默认由 Linux 内核 6.1 LTS 提供支持。但是，如果你更喜欢前沿的主线内核，那么你可以在不稳定的仓库中获取 6.3 和 5.15 LTS。



增强的应用和软件

内置应用堆栈已更新，包括基本应用。你可以使用稳定的 Firefox 102.12 ESR、Thunderbird 102.12、VLC 3.0 和 LibreOffice 7.4 作为关键应用。如果你更喜欢最新的 Firefox，那么可以使用 Firefox 114，它可以在单独的 Sparky 仓库中找到。

Sparky APTus AppCenter 是一款用于管理软件安装和更新的集成工具，已更新至版本 20230530，增强了用户的便利性。在一项重大更改中，systemd-timesyncd 取代了 ntp 以简化时间同步。

SparkyLinux 的旗舰产品 Xfce 桌面版本为 4.18，这是这款轻量级桌面的最新更新版本。此外，你还可以找到其他版本，例如 KDE Plasma 5.27、LXQt 1.2 和 MATE 1.26。

该团队还投入了大量精力来改进 amd64 ISO 映像，使其能够在具有 UEFI 主板和启用安全启动的机器上启动，从而扩展了对现代系统的兼容性。

那么，关于这个版本的更新就到这里了。我们来看看性能吧。



安装和性能

我使用 SparkyLinux Xfce 版本进行了本次评测的测试。Calamares 3.2.61 的安装很顺利，没有任何错误。如果你正在安装，你应该注意立付live介质的密码是 “live”，这是启动安装程序所必需的。

所有更新脚本（包括欢迎应用）在安装后运行良好。欢迎程序可让你快速访问所有系统信息和桌面功能。

我通过 Firefox（运行 YouTube 的 4 个以上选项卡）、文件管理器、绘图应用、终端、VLC、Synaptic 包管理器和 AppCenter 来运行这个版本。资源占用稍高一些。

此负载的内存消耗约为 2 GB，CPU 使用率平均约为 2%。SparkyLinux 7（Xfce）默认安装占用 5.2 GB 磁盘空间。

所以，总的来说，我相信它运行得相当好，但考虑到 Xfce 桌面，内存消耗似乎有点高。



总结

SparkyLinux 7 “Orion Belt” 带来了 Debian 的精华，为用户提供稳定性和多功能性的平衡组合。SparkyLinux 凭借其广泛的桌面风格、精选应用和专业版本，可以满足广泛的用户需求。

该版本将持续近两年的维护和安全更新。因此，你可以放心地采用它作为你的日常使用。

你可以从其 官方网站 下载 SparkyLinux。

去年 11 月推出的 ChatGPT，其网站的月流量和独立访客在 6 月首次出现下降。ChatGPT 网站的全球桌面和移动流量比 5 月份下降了 9.7%，独立访客下降了 5.7%，访客在网站上花费的时间也下降了 8.5%。ChatGPT 在推出两个月后，达到了 1 亿月度活跃用户。它是有史以来增长最快的消费者应用程序，现在拥有超过 15 亿的月访问量，是世界上排名前 20 的网站之一。

老王点评：看来 ChatGPT 的热度有点下降了，除非能在不久推出 GPT-5 —— 前一段时间有谣传 OpenAI 已经训练了 GPT-5，我对此是保持高度怀疑的。




英国的大学制定了关于生成性人工智能的指导原则

24 所罗素集团研究密集型大学的副校长们已经签署了一套指导原则，以确保学生和教职员工都具备人工智能知识。他们说这将有助于大学利用人工智能的机会，同时保护高等教育的学术严谨性和完整性。指导意见中说，应该教学生在学习中适当地使用人工智能，同时也让他们意识到生成性人工智能中存在的抄袭、偏见和不准确的风险。工作人员也必须接受培训，以便他们有能力帮助学生。

老王点评：这是一种务实的态度，毕竟已经不可阻挡，那就要学会如何与之相处。




Spotify 停止接受苹果应用商店支付

Spotify 通知其付费用户，“不再接受这种计费方式作为付款形式”。用户需要在上一个订阅期结束后，重新使用 Spotify 的高级订阅。由于苹果拿走了 30% 的应用内购买的费用，与直接通过 Spotify 订阅相比，通过应用内购买订阅的 Spotify 用户每月被额外收取 3 美元。尽管现在苹果公司在第一年后将订阅的佣金率降低到 15%。

但是，pdftk-java 最有用的场景是处理那种动辄几百页的没有目录的大 PDF 文件。这里所谓的目录不是指文档前面供打印的目录，而是指显示在 PDF 阅读器侧边栏里的目录，它在 PDF 格式中的正式叫法是“书签bookmarks”。



如果没有书签，就只能通过上下滚动或全局搜索文本来定位想要的章节，这非常麻烦。

PDF 文件的另一个恼人的小问题是缺乏元数据，比如标题和作者。如果你打开过一个标题栏上显示类似 “Microsoft Word - 04_Classics_Revisited.docx” 的 PDF 文件，你就能体会那种感觉了。

pdftk-java 让我能够创建自己的书签，我再也不面对这些问题了。

在 Linux 上安装 pdftk-java

正如 pdftk-java 的名称所示的，它是用 Java 编写的。它能够在所有主流操作系统上运行，只要你安装了 Java。

Linux 和 macOS 用户可以从 AdoptOpenJDK.net 安装 Java（LCTT 译注：原文为 Linux，应为笔误）。

Windows 用户可以安装 Red Hat&#x27;s Windows build of OpenJDK。

在 Linux 上安装 pdftk-java：


从 Gitlab 仓库下载 pdftk-all.jar release，保存至 ~/.local/bin/ 或 其它路径 下.

用文本编辑器打开 ~/.bashrc，添加 alias pdftk&#x3D;&#x27;java -jar $HOME/.local/bin/pdftk-all.jar&#x27;

正在寻找适用于 Ubuntu 的自由及开源 PDF 编辑器？继续阅读本文以了解 Ubuntu 的最佳 PDF 编辑器以及如何使用它们编辑 PDF 文件的分步指南。

Ubuntu 是深受开发人员、学生和专业人士欢迎的操作系统。编辑 PDF 文件是许多用户的常见任务，但找到适合该工作的工具可能很困难。在本文中，我们将介绍一些最好的免费和开源的 PDF 编辑器及其功能。

适用于 Ubuntu 和其他发行版的最佳免费 PDF 编辑器

LibreOffice Draw

LibreOffice 是一款流行的开源办公生产力套件。它的绘图组件名为 “LibreOffice Draw”，能够编辑 PDF。在此列表中的所有应用中，LibreOffice Draw 是在 Linux 中编辑 PDF 文件的最佳选择。

让我们看看如何编辑示例 PDF 和选项。


打开 LibreOffice Draw 并单击“文件File”&gt;“打开Open”

选择你要编辑的 PDF 文件

根据需要编辑 PDF 文件

这是正在编辑文本的示例图片。



关于 LibreOffice Draw 的一些使用说明：


LibreOffice Draw 本身将 PDF 组件检测为小的文本或图像块。例如，如果 PDF 文件中有一个段落，它会将其检测为单独的文本块。请参见下图。

这可能有点棘手，但你仍然可以仔细编辑它。

此外，你还可以在 PDF 文件中添加文本框和其他组件。

                              <span>The Fedora project is considering a
Fedora 40 change proposal to add limited, opt-out telemetry to the
workstation edition.  The proposal is detailed; it is clear that the
developers involved understand that this will be a hard sell in that
community.


	We believe an open source community can ethically collect limited
	aggregate data on how its software is used without involving big
	data companies or building creepy tracking profiles that are not in
	the best interests of users. Users will have the option to disable
	data upload before any data is sent for the first time. Our service
	will be operated by Fedora on Fedora infrastructure, and will not
	depend on Google Analytics or any other controversial third-party
	services. And in contrast to proprietary software operating
	systems, you can redirect the data collection to your own private
	metrics server instead of Fedora&#x27;s to see precisely what data is
	being collected from you, because the server components are open
	source too.</span>

2023 Linux Storage, Filesystem,
Memory-Management and BPF Summit, Hou Tao introduced his BPF iterators
for filesystem information.  Iterators for
BPF are a relatively recent addition to the BPF landscape; they help
BPF programs step through kernel data structures in a loop-like manner, but
without running afoul of the BPF verifier, which is notoriously hard to
convince about loops.</span>

the memory-management subsystem in a number of ways, but has also resulted
in a lot of code churn that has not been welcomed by all developers.  As
this work proceeds, though, some of the benefits from it are beginning to
become clear.  One example may well be in the handling of anonymous memory,
as can be seen in a pair of patch sets from Ryan Roberts.</span>

                              <span>Meta公司的新社交软件Threads已登陆美国苹果应用程序商店，这款社交应用预计将于7月6日正式发布，其与马斯克旗下的推特（Twitter）软件非常相似。


据美国有线电视新闻网（CNN）7月4日报道，Meta公司创始人兼首席执行官扎克伯格，坐拥Facebook和Instagram两款社交软件，其公司预告了一款新的应用程序Threads，该软件将通过提供一个可在线实时对话的平台来与推特竞争。根据苹果应用程序商店的列表，它预计将于7月6日正式上线。根据苹果商店的描述，该应用似乎与推特有许多相似之处。


“Threads是一个可以与他人一起讨论从你今天关心的主题到明天的趋势以及所有其他事情的社区。”上述描述写道，“无论你对什么感兴趣，你都可以关注并直接与你最喜欢的创作者和其他喜欢同样事物的人联系——或者建立自己的忠实追随者群体，与世界分享你的想法、观点和创造力。”


Meta公司在近日发布Threads这一新软件的决定，可能受推特在7月初出现故障的影响，推特在故障结束后宣布对其用户能够阅读的推文数量进行了临时限制。马斯克说，这些限制是为了 &quot;解决极端程度的数据搜刮和系统操纵&quot;。


马斯克7月3日在推特上评论了Threads，他说： &quot;谢天谢地，他们的运作是如此理智。“自2022年10月入主推特以来，马斯克对推特的运作方式进行了巨大的改动，他现在正在寻找让该平台恢复增长的方法。推特于7月3日宣布，用户很快需要为TweetDeck付费，这是一个可以让人们管理关注的账户的工具。


另一边，推特也在试图蚕食Meta的领域。今年5月，推特增加了加密信息功能，并表示后续将推出通话功能，这些发展可能使该平台与同样属于Meta的Facebook Messenger和WhatsApp竞争。

阿克塞尔·霍耐特（Axel Honneth，1949-）是著名德国社会哲学家，被誉为法兰克福学派“第三代”最重要的理论家，他的著作对中国读者来说也并不陌生。多年前读过他的《为承认而斗争》（Kampf um Anerkennung，1985；胡继华译，上海人民出版社，2005年），当时想到的是在我们的思想启蒙历程中，对于在个体经验中人的自信、道德尊严和自我实现的希望究竟是如何被摧毁、被蔑视的。这个重要问题仍然没有在社会理论研究中受到应有的重视，因此在读到霍耐特从青年黑格尔的承认理论发展出他的“为承认而斗争”的时候确有一种震撼之感。但是对于霍耐特从规范性范畴出发建构爱、法律和共同体意识等三种承认模式，并且深信建立在道德基础上的承认模式与共同体的团结具有现实可能性，我的疑虑则从未消失。可能对于我们来说重要的不是观念史的从“认同”到“承认”的发展问题，而首先是“承认”作为一种在现实经验中如何能够被承认的问题；关于“承认”的观念性阐释的可能性与诱惑反而更凸显了在现实语境中的困惑性。但是无论如何，对于霍耐特在观念史与社会理论建构方面的穿透性阐释的能力是留下了深刻印象。 
近日读阿克塞尔·霍耐特的《时代的活体解剖：20世纪观念史肖像》（原书名Vivisektionen eines Zeitalters:Porträtes zur Ideenheschichte des 20Jahrhunderts，2014），有一种在观念史与个体经验及时代现实感之间紧密联系的感受，由此想到的是霍耐特的这个研究视角及其在论述中呈现的思想观念冲突对我们而言可能具有某种特殊的启发性和现实意义。霍耐特在该书中所选取的十一位理论家的共同点是“从20世纪的历史经验空间中获得理论创…</span>

                              <span>小说家霍桑（1804-1864）是美国“黑暗浪漫主义”的代表人物，以《红字》《七角楼房》《福谷传奇》和《玉石雕像》等四大罗曼司闻名于世。此外，霍桑在短篇小说创作方面也卓有建树，有短篇“圣手”之美誉。他的短篇佳构多收录于《故事重述》（1837）、《古屋青苔》（1846）和《雪影》（1852）等三部故事集中，其中若干题材涉及巫术、变形以及万灵药水等超自然现象，无疑是对社会现实的扭曲反映。这类故事的主人公大多生性善良，不乏艺术天赋，但由于身处恶劣环境之中，往往难以逃脱悲剧性结局。同时代的小说家梅尔维尔曾评价霍桑隐居“古屋”（Old Manse）期间创作的短篇小说“笼罩在黑暗之中，因而分外黑暗”，并指明作家的本意并非神异其事，而是影射现实——从这个角度看，此类短篇皆可归为“寓言”。
《雪影》（The Snow-Image）取材于新英格兰普通家庭生活：家中两个孩子与雪花形成的雪孩一道在户外快乐玩耍，宽厚仁慈的父亲担心雪孩受冻，坚持将其带回家中炉前烘烤，雪孩立时化为一滩水渍。这是霍桑笔下最浅显的儿童寓言：作家一方面以清丽的笔触描绘自然景物，一方面讴歌人性之纯洁善良。然而，故事的结局却点明本文寓意所在：美国社会（及民众）最为推崇的务实精神与心灵世界格格不入——从一定意义上甚至可以说前者是后者的天敌。由于缺乏艺术的想象力和感知力，他们往往在无意之中扼杀美和艺术。
《海德格尔医生的实验》（Dr. Heidegger’s Experiment）同样是一则寓言。故事中的医生邀请五位老友，前来品尝他最新的科学发明——一种能让人返老还童的青春泉水。在场的所有人都信誓旦旦，保证重获青春后将开始崭新的生活。可当他们喝下泉水、如愿重回青春岁月后，立刻又恢复了旧时的恶习本性。最后，众人在一番抢夺中失手打碎水壶，于是一场美梦宣告破碎。这一故事体现了霍桑短篇一贯的主题，即“人性恶”无处不在：它可能在某些特定条件…</span>

                              <span>I have a HP Pavilion 15 gaming ec0xxx and Windows experience on it sucks, and there is no Linux distro that has worked error free.
 Ubuntu - Would work fine then after sometime would start falling apart and start throwing errors randomly, randomly stops recognizing bluetooth card
 Debain - usb ports would stop working without the charger
 Arch - just found it too hard to use drivers
 Other distros like Pop, mint have had the same problems.
 Is there really any reason as to why it happens? Or any distro that can work well

                              <span>You may know about cloud storage, and how you can download a computer app for it to backup any new files or recently modified files to your cloud storage drive.
 However, I&#x27;m talking in the sense of local drives. Is there ways to have it do the same thing, but the backup location is local drives?
 If this exists, I would like to know the best backup solution for this, if it&#x27;s software, then the best one that is most recommended, and works with Windows and Linux computers.

                              <span>Heya guys. Aside from a few things here and there, I&#x27;ve pretty much moved from win10 to Linux mint (soon switching to RebornOS). One of the few things I loved about win10 was the full screen start menu. Does anybody know of something similar available to use on Linux? Thanks

Press any Key to reboot this machine&quot;
 This is with legacy boot on. With UEFI, I get a similar error
 I figure this is something to do with Grub, but am pretty unfamiliar with how it works. It&#x27;s always just worked for me. This has a guide on how to fix the issue one Windows, would doing the steps to repair the MBR help me? (&quot;Method 2. Fix corrupted MBR&quot; near bottom of page)
 Any help would be great!

 It&#x27;s not that specific either, so... as long as your answer fits the question, it&#x27;s good.

It installs the SILO bootloader but after installation it does not have an entry for Solaris 10. After a quick look it seems Solaris does not have the kernel in one file but many.
 Is it possible in Red Hat 6.2 to get its SILO bootloader to put to a Solaris kernel and boot it?

 ​
 ghidra: can see context menu, but menu bar is bugged
 so far ive tried:

                              <span>I have a HP laptop, 4gb of ram and a Intel Celeron CPU n3060 1.6 GHz CPU , it hilariously slow running window 10 let alone running basic programs , I&#x27;ve been thinking about switching to Linux because I hear that &quot; it brings life to your old PC &quot; but felt skeptical, what are your thoughts ? And if yes what version should I get ?

                              <span>I&#x27;ve seen the haters and the newbies/questioners here go on about how linux is this bad, that it is confusing, etc. I wanted to share positive story!
 Admittedly I&#x27;ve been IT a long time, used linux on servers for a long time, and have generally been a Windows user for any GUI and office use.
 About a year ago, I bought a DELL Inspiron 15 3511 with Windows 10. I cared for it, upgraded software, and generally tried to keep it healthy. It was prone to blue-screens of death, horrible wifi connectivity issues, and handful of other nuisances. I upgraded to Win 11 and that was a trade up a little but the machine was unstable frequently enough that I was considering getting rid of the machine.
 Then, one day, the SSD on the machine outright dies. I didn&#x27;t have a full backup so I decided to take the risk and install Ubuntu on the new SSD.
 I am delighted with the functionality under Ubuntu and Gnome, AND the stability of the machine has gone up to near perfect.
 Of course, everyone has difference experiences, but I wanted to share that you CAN win with using linux (Ubuntu) on a laptop over Windows... particularly for stability over Windows.
 Have a great day!

                              <span>Dear friend, I invite you to a joint DUG#2 + vPub v7 event that will start this Thursday at 4PM UTC. Would you like to learn more about:
  
the opensource firmware world and its current events, i.e. the recent opensource firmware developments (OpenSIL) for new AMD PCs?
 the interesting open hardware devices like Nitrokey opensource security tokens?
  
Then this upcoming event - is an excellent opportunity for you to have a great time in a company of fellow firmware enthusiasts.
 The 1st part of event - DUG #2 - is dedicated to Dasharo distribution of coreboot opensource firmware with advanced features (like GUI &amp; FLASHBIOS) and the ecosystem around it. DUG will take place between 4-6 PM UTC - and then around 6 PM UTC will switch to vPub. The past events have been highly successful, and I&#x27;m sure you will find this time interesting as well ;-) Both sound/video and text chats will be available for your convenience

                              <span>I am relatively new to my company and I inherited a number of Servers.
 Local physical servers and servers in our AWS cloud accounts.
 The problem is I am not well-versed with Linux. And almost all are Linux based servers. 
 The turn-over process to me is like:
 &quot;this is the Proxy Server.&quot;
 &quot;This is the authentication server.&quot;
 &quot;This is our logging server.&quot;
 &quot;This is our ticketing server.&quot;
 &quot;This is a DB server for tests, etc&quot;
 &quot;This is our monitoring server&quot;
 -Here are the admin credentials. 
 Actually helps a lot that I got the admin accounts of all these servers so I can freely see what&#x27;s inside in each server.

                              <span>I&#x27;m looking for a career change with above average job salaries. My dad works as a senior linux administrator and has suggested I get into this field as well. He has given me access to courses on A Cloud Guru that can allow me to complete any certifications if I wanted to. I have no prior experience with Linux or anything tech related. I&#x27;m about 25% done with the Linux Foundation Certification already. I just graduated college with an economics major. I&#x27;m willing to get these certifications but I&#x27;m looking to get a job as soon as possible. 
 Which certification would be my best bet into getting a job quick with no other prior experience besides that certification?
 How long would it take me to land a job that can potentially be remote?
 What are other ways/jobs/certificates/trainings that would land me a job ASAP within this field (or other fields in general) since I have so much access to course trainings.

                              <span>Im working on a tool that makes it easier for people to switch from using &quot;snap&quot; packages to &quot;Flatpak&quot; packages on their computer. This tool will do the following:
  
Identify what &quot;snap&quot; apps are currently installed on their computer.
 Automatically download the corresponding &quot;Flatpak&quot; version of those apps.
 Remove the &quot;snap&quot; version from their system.
  
To make this tool work better, I need a list of &quot;snap&quot; apps that also have &quot;Flatpak&quot; versions available. I started with a list from a project called &quot;unsnap,&quot; but it&#x27;s a bit outdated now, so I&#x27;m looking for a more updated and comprehensive list.
 If you know of any recent and complete lists of &quot;snap&quot; apps with their &quot;Flatpak&quot; alternatives, I would really appreciate your help. This way, more people can use the tool to switch to &quot;Flatpak&quot; packages easily, even for a larger variety of apps. Thanks!
 Here Is the repo and the link to google forms to input the data.

                              <span>This is a neat trick I&#x27;ve used to write self-extracting software or scripts that extract files from archives by just using
    tail -c  $0

One thing to bear in mind is that if you append binary data, it will be corrupted if you save it in most text editors so when I want to make changes I just delete all the binary and reappend it.

                              <span>I saw this [0] pretty cool thread by user revskill, and wanted a quicker way to search through it, but also to keep them all in one place so I can read them at my leisure whenever I get time.
Right now is like 60 lines of Ruby using Nokogiri, but I will certainly look into it further down the line and improve the list.
There&#x27;s a cronjob checking the thread every 12 hours but I will eventually shut that down and it will become static after that.
There are some really awesome blogs in there. I really recommend going through the list, it made my day.

                              <span>Ruihan Li has disclosed
a significant vulnerability introduced into the 6.1 kernel:


	A flaw was found in the handling of stack expansion in the Linux
	kernel 6.1 through 6.4, aka &quot;Stack Rot&quot;. The maple tree,
	responsible for managing virtual memory areas, can undergo node
	replacement without properly acquiring the MM write lock, leading
	to use-after-free issues. An unprivileged local user could use this
	flaw to compromise the kernel and escalate their privileges.

	As StackRot is a Linux kernel vulnerability found in the memory
	management subsystem, it affects almost all kernel configurations
	and requires minimal capabilities to trigger. However, it should be
	noted that maple nodes are freed using RCU callbacks, delaying the
	actual memory deallocation until after the RCU grace
	period. Consequently, exploiting this vulnerability is considered
	challenging.


The disclosure contains a detailed description of the problem.  Fixes have
been merged into the
mainline and the 6.4.1, 6.3.11, and 6.1.37
stable kernel updates.</span>

	While the team behind Linux Containers regrets that decision and

美国国家安全分析人士警告说，中国的人工智能公司可能通过使用云服务绕过了现行的出口管制规则。这些服务允许客户获得强大的计算能力，而不需要购买控制清单上的先进设备 —— 包括芯片，如英伟达的 A100 芯片。美国政府正准备限制中国公司使用美国的云计算服务，要求亚马逊和微软等美国云服务提供商在向中国客户提供使用先进人工智能芯片的云计算服务之前，必须寻求美国政府的许可。

老王点评：又是一次重击。不过，没有先进芯片就无法制造 AI 么，未必。




Canonical 收回对 LXD 的控制

LXD 作为 Linux 容器（LXC）的开源容器管理扩展，长期以来一直与 Canonical 密切相关，是它的软件产品之一。之前，LXD 一直是 LXC 项目的一部分，但 Canonical 已经决定将其更多地拉入自己的直接控制范围。LXD 的 GitHub 资源库被转移到 Canonical 名下，其官网、YouTube 频道、论坛都也随之转移。LXC 社区对失去 LXD 表示遗憾。

老王点评：越来越多的看到企业对开源暴露出了狼外婆的笑容。




最后一个支持 Windows 7/8 的 Firefox 版本发布

刚刚发布的 Firefox 115 是一个扩展支持版本（ESR），它将一直支持到 2024 年 9 月，之后不再提供安全更新。ESR 为许多下游项目提供了支持，如 Thunderbird、KaiOS。此外，如果你使用过时的操作系统，ESR 也是你唯一能依赖的 Firefox 版本，如微软在 2023 年 1 月终止支持的 Windows 7 和 Windows 8，以及苹果的 MacOS 10.14、10.13 或 10.12 等等。

                              <span>人们使用树莓派做各种各样的事情。有哪些用途让你特别好奇的吗？


最近，我在一个电话会议上听到有人说开源社区是好奇心和解决问题的文化的结合。好奇心是我们解决问题的基础。在解决各种规模的问题时，我们使用了大量的开源工具，其中包括在功能极为方便的树莓派上运行的 Linux。

我们每个人都有各种不同的生活经历，所以我向我们的作者社区询问了他们所遇到的最奇特的树莓派用途。我有一种预感，这些令人惊奇的构建将会为其他人激发灵感。

使用树莓派进行实验

对我来说，树莓派是在家庭网络中增加额外开发资源的绝佳工具。如果我想要创建一个新的网站或者尝试一个新的软件工具，我不必让我的桌面 Linux 机器因为一堆我可能只在实验时使用一次的软件包而变得笨重。相反，我会将它设置在我的树莓派上。

如果我认为我将要做一些冒险的事情，我会使用备份的启动环境。我有两张 microSD 卡，这样我就可以在树莓派上插一张卡，同时设置第二张卡进行任何我想要的实验。额外的 microSD 卡成本并不高，但在我想要在第二个镜像上进行实验的时候，它能节省大量时间。只需关机，换下 microSD 卡，重新启动，立即就可以在专用的测试系统上工作。

当我不进行实验时，我的树莓派充当打印服务器，将我的非 WiFi 打印机连接到家庭网络上。它还是一个方便的 SSH 文件服务器，让我可以快速备份重要文件。

树莓派的流行

我见过的树莓派最令人惊讶的事情是它使小型单板计算机的概念变得流行和通俗化，并使其真正实用于大众。

在树莓派出现之前，我们有类似的小型单板计算机，但它们往往是小众的、昂贵的，并且从软件角度来看让人拒之千里。树莓派价格便宜，便宜到任何人都可以轻松为一个项目获得一台（不考虑目前难以获得的情况）。一旦它变得便宜，人们就会克服软件挑战，使其足够好以解决许多基本的计算任…</span>

                              <span>技术兄弟们，大家好，在这篇文章中我们将介绍如何在 Ubuntu 22.04 中安装和使用 Wireshark。


Wireshark 是自由开源的、跨平台的、基于 GUI 的网络数据包分析器，可用于 Linux、Windows、MacOS、Solaris 等。它实时捕获网络数据包并以人类可读的格式呈现它们。它使我们能够监控微观层面的网络数据包。它还有一个名为 tshark 的命令行程序，它执行与 Wireshark 相同的功能，但通过终端而不是通过 GUI。

Wireshark 可用于网络故障排除、分析、软件和通信协议开发，也可用于教育目的。Wireshark 使用名为 pcap 的库来捕获网络数据包。

Wireshark 的功能


支持检查数百种协议

能够实时捕获数据包并保存它们以供以后离线分析

一些用于分析数据的过滤器

捕获的数据可以动态压缩和解压缩

支持多种数据分析文件格式，输出也可以保存为 XML、CSV、纯文本格式

可以从以太网、WiFi、蓝牙、USB、帧中继、令牌环等多种接口捕获数据


先决条件


预装 Ubuntu 22.04

具有 sudo 权限的本地用户

互联网连接


Wireshark 安装步骤

从 Ubuntu 仓库安装

Wireshark 包可在默认的 Ubuntu 仓库中找到，并且可以使用以下命令简单地安装。但你可能无法获得最新版本的 wireshark。

$ sudo apt update
$ sudo apt install wireshark




选择 “Yes” 允许非超级用户使用 Wireshark 捕获数据包：



安装成功后，访问 Wireshare UI。从“活动Activities”中搜索 “wireshark”，然后单击其图标。

《心智与政治秩序》具有一种老派的风格。它勾勒了一个庞大而整全的体系，也预告了更完整的写作计划。在这个意义上说，这部著作的确是罕见的，充满了智识上的坚忍和勇气。
吴彦的出发点是对自由主义政治哲学的不满。除去一些被自由主义的批评者重复指出的问题外，吴彦以一种具有新意的方式，提出了自己的问题：自由主义政治哲学忽略了中介问题，偏于个人和国家两极，人为制造了个人与国家的对立。其结果导致了个人和国家都变得空洞化，而空洞化又使人败坏，最终让国家也跟着败坏了。吴彦是这样说的：“……循着个人与国家的二分而在两种基本立场之间——或是偏于国家或是偏于个人——徘徊，从而遗忘了国家在其发挥其理应发挥的作用时所依赖的一种介于国家和个人之间的存在，那便是各类共同体。”（138页）
除了这条线索之外，吴彦还提示了另一条线索，就是书名所揭示的“心智与政治秩序”之间的关系。吴彦说，“政治和心智具有很强的同构性”（48页）。“我们的社会和政治结构在很大程度上立基于心灵的这一基本构造之中，尤其是心灵中那些与道德和政治现象密切相关的元素……有关心灵活动的研究以及重塑心灵活动的技艺，在很大程度上将构成我们未来道德和政治哲学探究和活动的基础。”“一种良好的道德和政治秩序就是内嵌于人的心灵之中的‘理性’的一种展现。”（84页）这里提出的是一个古老的问题。但是这条线索令人困惑，因为读者并不容易理解，究竟在“个人—共同体—国家”这一秩序中，心灵的秩序是怎样与之同构的，而国家又究竟对应着心智的哪个部分。这样的问题在柏拉图那里，答案是清晰的。
从作品的整体结构来看，中介问题才是要点所在。吴彦试图凭借托马斯主义的传统，为政治哲学重新找回这些作为中介的共同体。他尤其强调了家庭和大学这两个典型的次级共同体。可以理解。因为这两个次级共同体与德性论密切相…</span>

                              <span>Hi guys,
 so I just switched from Windows to Linux and I decided to use Fedora 38 as my first system.
 I installed the OS, updates, upgrades, etc...
 The nvidia driver is installed (latest version I believe so), but the system feels very slow for some reason. Also the steam is getting bug reloading the store page (App installed in the software center). Also got a bug where I was watching a friend stream on discord and it was having a lot of stuttering (had to switch to discord app and worked just fine). I think my pc specs wouldn&#x27;t do this since never happened on windows. In case the problem is really the system I will maybe switch to Linux Mint since was the 1st option I had in mind due to friendly user.
 Someone using Fedora 38 and having the same issue or already had and was able to resolve?
 Nvidia version: 535.54.03
 NVML Version: 12.535.54.03
 ​

 Thanks a lot!

                              <span>I&#x27;ve been using Ubuntu as my daily driver since I switched from Windows as my work machine (I&#x27;m a sysadmin) about 3 years ago. I fell in love with superb performance but the sweetest bit for me was how streamlined my workflow became using SSH for everything, Remmina etc.
 How easy would it be to move to Debian instead as my daily driver workstation? I love Ubuntu but snaps are hideous and I feel I should really go with a truly fully Open Source distro, especially after watching &quot;Learn Linux TV&quot;&#x27;s latest YouTube video. Currently on Ubuntu 22.04.

                              <span>Hey guys. So, my linux machine cannot connect out to sites, after uninstall of iVPN and ProtonVPN, post reboot. 
 If I look at nmcli -p device, it shows eno1/ethernet as unmanaged, and the loopback the same as unmanaged. If I look at ip address cmdlet output, it still shows eno1 picking up addressing.. 
 .. what am I missing here? How can get the net connection reinstated?

 I&#x27;m looking for offline app for mind maps, thought maps with android app but that&#x27;s not a must. I have installed XMind and I don&#x27;t know yet if it&#x27;s good to invest my time in it. Will be there a need for net access for some essential function? Maybe there are some other great apps of that kind that you use.

                              <span>Hi
 I am in the process of buying a new laptop and I would VERY MUCH like to only use amd hardware... the problem right now is that only the asus tuf a16 have a new amd cpu and gpu inside it or else i should look at yoga 6 for iGPU 780m.
 There are many MANY reasons why i would like to NOT use nvidia.. but if I have to... then how does it perform now...
 I have heard it has gotten better with wayland, but by how much ?... how is it compared to AMD today ?
 is it any good, will it get better ?
 thanks :)

                              <span>I am using a UPS For a Raspberry Pi 4B 8G Model Is using a Battery Bank Safe? 
 Like I have it on a charge while connected to the Raspberry Pi, I just fear that It might Kill the battery. 
 If anyone is wondering if they can get me feedback on this that would be amazing| 
 Before people ask what one I am using for the power I have sent the Amazon link.

                              <span>Is windows boot faking it? Let me explain: I was windows user before and i use linux now and used both in same hardware. One thing i noticed is when i boot linux it just open grub directly then boot my os, there is no logo of the hardware manufacturer in my case asus, but when i boot windows there is a logo of asus first then after a while it start booting windows, why is this? My theory is windows is the one that displaying the manufacturer logo to create the illusion of its the hardware loading up because if it was all windows logo it will make it look so slow. And the hardware manufacturer gets branding in returns. I know this is such a noob assumption but am really curious

                              <span>As a person who has used both Windows, Mac and Linux, I have come to the conclusion that this is the time for me and others to switch to Linux. I am in control of what I do; in Linux the majority of distros have no ads, and no &quot;reccomended settings&quot; that Microsoft tries to get you to use to sell more personal info. Trying to install Windows 11 got my computer in a boot loop and had to take out a battery underneath my gpu (I am very inexperienced with the physical side of computers) so I have given up hope for Windows. I will still have a Windows 10 VM for special windows apps that don&#x27;t work with Wine - but Linux is getting a lot more recognition than it had in the past.

                              <span>If you had serious enough resources (a team of several dozen or hundreds of people), how would you create a Linux distribution?
 Maybe your own package manager? Your own provisioning system? Your own desktop environment?
 The question is purely philosophical. I am not going to make another &quot;cool Linux distribution&quot;. I am just interested in the opinion of the community.

                              <span>I&#x27;ve been using Linux on my desktop for about a year now and I am all in. I always knew Windows was junk but had no idea how bad it was until I tried an alternative. People I know are tired of me using any excuse to all over it. lol
  
 My career has stalled out a little bit this month and its time for me to rethink what I want to do with my life. I have over a decade of experience as a full stack web developer so I have a good understanding of the basics of programming. I&#x27;ve even maintained a few Linux web servers but didn&#x27;t do anything special to configure them.
  
 Even in IT, everyone is convinced that you need to be big brained to have anything to do with Linux so there aren&#x27;t tons of people out there that know how to use it. It makes me wonder what I would have to learn to pivot into being a system admin or something. I don&#x27;t know. This whole thing is an idea that just popped into my head 10 min ago so I am still figuring things out. Any advice? Certifications or courses you would recommend? Is there a lot of remote work for a person that knows a lot about linux?

                              <span>At my workplace I have old computer with CPU being i3-530, gpu being i-gpu of i3-530 and hdd as storage, ram capacity of 3gb and OS being windows 10. 
 As far as I have found out, the limiting factors for computational speed of this PC are low RAM capacity (i work with experimental datasets in python and OriginPro 2021,some datasets files can grow into 1-2gb-ish volume ) and HDD speed. 
 I can spare a little money for used 2*8gb ddr3 kit, but I don&#x27;t really wanna buy new ssd. 
 I am quite pissed off on how strong lag can be produced by windows defender or telemetry when those instances are running. 
 So, I am planning to install archlinux (so my system would be free of useless bloat- and malware) on free partition of HDD in hope I would get smoother experience and a lot of other Linux advantages. Would be BTRFS a good pick for hdd or should I pick other file system? If I was installing Linux on ssd I would&#x27;ve picked F2FS.

                              <span>Not familiar with SuSE product ecosystem, and trying to take a shortcut by avoiding to learn all about it in detail. I see references to various offerings like ALP, Liberty, SLES etc. I am familiar with the RH ecosystem of products and projects a bit more, and trying to draw some parallels. More specifically, I am interested in container base image -- especially the very small footprint, minimalistic options, that RedHat Universal Base Image (UBI) offers. More specifically, I am looking for any similar offerings from SuSE that are actually backed by strong commercial support.

he is now using that experience to write a series on &quot;Red Hat and the Clone
Wars&quot;.  The first two episodes were Red
Hat and the Clone Wars and A
history of the early 2000s Linux landscape; the latest is The
dawn of CentOS:


	In 2009, the main project admin for CentOS went radio
	silent. CentOS had been spun up in the wild west days of the
	Internet, when it seemed totally fine to let one person hold the
	domain, communications channels, and funds. Oops.

	Folks depending on CentOS suddenly had a Come to Jesus moment. What
	happens if your production systems depend on a project where the
	main admin is AWOL and you have no plan for that?</span>

                              <span>libjpeg-turbo 3.0 发布，开发者表示无力继续

这个开源的 JPEG 图像编解码器每天有数十亿人通过浏览器、操作系统和图像查看器/编辑器使用，并且它是 ISO/ITU-T 的参考实现，经过了严格的审查。它的主要开发者 DRC 在 3.0 发布公告中说，这可能是功能开发的结束，很可能不会有 3.1 版本。DRC 表示，目前该项目只有每月约 8-10 小时的一般资金支持。而完成 3.0 测试版需要借用 2023 年所有预期的一般资金，而修复错误需要借用到 2024 年 9 月的所有资金，也就是说该项目未来 15 个月实际上将处于 “维护模式”。它的开发者 DRC 的大部分收入来自他的另外两个项目 VirtualGL 和 TurboVNC，而从 2010-2018 年，DRC 投入了相当于几十万美元的时间来开发 libjpeg-turbo 2.0，甚至导致负债时，不得不停止在该项目上投入。

老王点评：很多开源开发者花费了自己的时间金钱来贡献给开源，但是他们也需要钱来生活。不知道那些嫌弃别人白嫖他们的开源代码的人，是不是也白嫖过其它的上游项目呢？




Valve 拒绝发布带有人工智能生成内容的游戏

一位独立开发者在论坛上发帖说，Valve “不再愿意发布有人工智能生成内容的游戏”。他们提交的游戏有 “一些相当明显的 AI 生成的素材”。Valve 在给开发者回复中称，“我们不能发布开发者没有所有必要权利的游戏。目前，我们拒绝分发你的游戏，因为我们不清楚用于创建素材的底层人工智能技术是否对训练数据有足够的权利。”考虑到大多数人工智能工具不能真正声称对其所有的训练数据有合法权利（即使它们有，也可能不是对该数据的道德使用），这一政策的陈述基本上相当于对游戏中人工智能生成的资产的全面禁止。Valve 表示，他们的政策更多的是 “法律上的要求”，而不是对人工智能的任何特定立场，其审查过程“是对现行版权法和政策的反映，而不是我们意见的附加层。”

老王点评：这件事凸显了现有的版权法律无法适应人工智能的需要。究竟什么样的内容可以被人工智能刮取并生成内容，然后这些内容的版权归属于谁。如果要归属于原内容提供者，人工智能是否有可能、有意义地明确地指出来源？




谷歌将用网络上公开的所有信息训练人工智能

谷歌上周末更新了其隐私政策，明确表示该公司保留刮取你在网上发布的所有信息以建立其人工智能工具的权利。谷歌举例说，将“使用公开的信息来帮助训练谷歌的人工智能模型，并建立产品和功能，如谷歌翻译、Bard 和云人工智能功能”。以前，谷歌说这些数据将被用于 “语言模型”，而不是 “人工智能模型”，而旧政策只提到谷歌翻译，现在也包括 Bard 和云人工智能。

老王点评：和上一条对应，谷歌利用互联网“公开”的信息训练的人工智能，其输出的内容的版权如何界定？现在大家都黑不提白不提的就这样糊涂着，是想造成既成事实倒逼法律认可，还是需要更多的实践和探讨？</span>

                              <span>了解如何使用用于切换目录的一个基本但必不可少的 Linux 命令。


Linux 中的 cd 命令用于更改目录。cd 实际上是“更改目录change directories”的缩写。

这是你必须了解的 基本 Linux 命令之一。

使用 cd 命令非常简单：

cd path_to_directory


不可能比这更简单了，对吧。

然而，你应该理解它的路径部分，以便轻松地浏览 文件系统 而不会感到困惑。

这是绝对路径和相对路径的快速回顾：



如果你需要更多细节，我建议你阅读这篇文章：


Linux 上的绝对路径和相对路径有什么不同


让我们看一些使用 cd 命令的示例。

使用绝对路径更改目录

从视觉上看会更容易理解。看下图。



我当前的位置是我的主目录（/home/abhishek），我必须进入 scripts 目录中的 python 目录。

假设我想使用绝对路径。python 目录的绝对路径是 /home/abhishek/scripts/python。

cd /home/abhishek/scripts/python




使用相对路径更改目录

让我们举同样的例子，但这次我将采用相对路径。



我的主目录到 python 目录的相对路径是 scripts/python。让我们用这个：

cd scripts/python




进入上级目录

到目前为止，你一直在进入下级。如果你必须进入上级目录怎么办？

假设你位于 /home/abhishek/scripts/python 中，并且必须将目录添加到 scripts？



使用绝对路径始终是一种选择，但它相当冗长。相反，你可以使用特殊的目录符号 ..。双点 （..）表示父目录或上一级目录。单点（.）表示当前目录。

cd ..


这是一个例子：



你可以使用 .. 在 Linux 文件系统层次结构中向上移动路径。

假设我在上图中的 python 目录中，想要进入 code 目录。这是我能做的：

cd ../../code




进入主目录

如果你在所有这些目录切换中感到迷失并想回到主目录，有很多简单的快捷方式。

事实上，最简单的就是使用不带任何选项的 cd 命令。

cd


这将使你从文件系统上的任何位置返回主目录。

或者，你可以使用 ~ 符号，表示主目录。

cd ~




进入根目录

尽管你不会像前一个那样经常使用它，但了解一下仍然有好处。

如果你想返回文件系统开始的根目录，请使用以下命令：

cd /


这里不涉及“魔法”。当放在路径开头使用时，/ 表示根。不要将它与路径分隔符混淆。



切换回上一级目录

这是一个救命稻草，或者我应该说是“省时稻草”。当你深入目录结构，然后转到另一个目录，然后你觉得需要返回到以前的位置时，此快捷方式会有所帮助。

cd -


还不清楚吗？ 让我举个例子。

我位于 /etc/apt/sources.list.d。从这里，进入 /home/abhishek/scripts/python 来处理我的代码。然后我意识到我必须再次检查 /etc/apt/sources.list.d 目录中的某些内容。

通常的方法是这样做，这让我再次输入所有路径：



但聪明的方法是使用这个：



看吧，无需再次输入冗长的路径。如期工作！

🏋️ 练习时间

如果你想练习 cd 命令，这里有一些练习供你使用。


打开终端并进入 /var/log 目录。检查目录内容。你看到了什么？

现在，进入 /var 目录。这是一个上级目录。

从这里返回你的主目录。


这些内容足以让你熟悉 cd 命令。以下是你应该了解的其他一些重要命令。


每个 Ubuntu 用户都应该知道的 31 条 Linux 命令


如果你有疑问或建议，请告诉我。

                              <span>以下是为什么大多数黑客和渗透测试人员喜欢使用 Kali Linux 的几个原因。


Kali Linux 是一个基于 Debian “测试版” 的 Linux 操作系统，创建于近十年前。在过去几年里，它在黑客和网络安全专业人员中非常流行。随着对数字基础设施的越来越多的依赖和网络威胁的不断增长，网络安全对于普通用户和企业来说变得更加重要。

道德黑客和渗透测试人员在识别漏洞和加强系统安全方面发挥着重要作用。由于 Kali Linux 具备为安全测试和分析而量身定制的全面工具和功能，因此成为他们的首选操作系统。



概述

Kali Linux 由 Offensive Security（一家美国信息安全公司）维护，并得到社区中数千名贡献者的支持。它跟随 Debian 的 “测试版” 分支的发展，保持与最新软件包的同步，为黑客们提供了最新模块来进行工作。

此外，Kali Linux 支持多种架构，例如 x86、x86-64、armel 和 armhf，这有助于黑客在广泛的硬件范围内使用。

使用此发行版的最大优势之一是它适用于多个技术平台，你可以下载和使用。以下是其中一些平台：


32 位和 64 位的安装镜像（ISO）

预构建的虚拟机镜像

ARM 架构镜像

用于移动设备的安卓镜像

Docker 和 LXD 镜像

可在各个厂商提供的云中使用

只读的 LIVE ISO 镜像

可在 Windows 的 Linux 子系统（WSL）上使用


为何它备受青睐

强大的渗透测试工具

Kali Linux 提供了丰富的渗透测试工具，使黑客能够识别并利用漏洞。这些工具包括网络扫描器、密码破解器、无线攻击框架和 Web 应用程序评估工具。这个操作系统内置了如此之多的工具，极大地简化了黑客的工作流程，使他们能够有效专注于目标。

                              <span>中华书局本《谈艺录》118页引宋人《四六话》的名言，以论放翁云：“《四六话》论隶事，有‘伐山语、伐材语’之别；放翁诗中，美具难并，然亦不无蹈袭之嫌者。”意谓陆游多是“伐材”，“非拓境宇、启山林手也”。444页补订云：“不知东坡为用此事之伐山手，放翁以下皆只伐材。”498页语及用《寒食帖》事又云：“按晁冲之伐山，始取《寒食帖》入诗，南宋多继而伐材者。”“伐山、伐材”之别，见于王铚《四六话》卷上：“四六有伐山语，有伐材语。伐材语者，如已成之柱桷，略加绳削而已；伐山语者，则搜山（搜山一作披山）开荒，自我取之。伐材谓熟事也，伐山谓生事也。”（据《历代文话》本）简言之，凡是第一个用别人所从未用过的事，就是“伐山”；而用别人所已经用过的事，就是“伐材”。“伐山”优于“伐材”，是不必说的。文人作文如是，学者著书亦然。所以顾炎武另有一个著名的比喻，那就是其《与人书十》中说的：“今人纂辑之书，正如今人之铸钱。古人采铜于山，今人则买旧钱，名之曰废铜，以充铸而已。”拟喻虽有不同，精神却是相通的。乃至于学人征文考献，亦贵伐山的第一手材料，而轻转手的伐材之事。通人必须博览，但是“书囊无底”，所以就是通人，也免不了有时要“伐材”。我去年年底时，因为住在铜陵，手边无别的书可读，所以把三十年前读过的《谈艺录》，又重读了一过，因此而屡见博极群书的钱先生所引的书，也多有是从伐材而得的。钱先生的“伐材之事”，我以前在《钱边缀琐》中指过一些，但那是瞥记随举的，不及这次所获之多。故写为一篇，供给研究“钱学”及喜谈掌故的人参考。
一
钱先生于陈衍的著述，无疑是谙熟于胸的，《石语》记陈誉其云“世兄记老夫诗熟”，可为一证。这都不必多说。陈的《石遗室诗话》，在钱先生的《中文笔记》中，却并没有笔记，那可能是因为太熟之故，所以不复札之于纸了。《谈艺录》中则多次引及石遗，在近人中是少有的，但暗本《石遗室诗话》，而又不加注明的，也…</span>

                              <span>There are existing HN job aggregators, but I thought we could take it a step further.
Inspired by an insightful comment on a previous thread (https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id&#x3D;36163021), I built a tool that aggregates job postings and intelligently categorizes them based on user-specific preferences:
* Country and remote work preferences
* Employer type (e.g., startup, corporation, government)
* Industry
* Technologies used
* Role type (developer, architect, product owner, etc.)
* Salary range (where available)
One of the superpowers of LLMs is reformatting information from any format X to any other format Y.
We leverage this to map all the unstructured job postings into the same unified structure. The new GPT functions feature and the extended context windows are really helpful for this.
Instead of having to build a custom NER pipeline, it works very well with GPT out-of-the box.
One challenge is keeping the filters consistent and merging of duplicates. Embeddings help with that.
What&#x27;s next:
* Integrate additional sources. We can generate web scrapers and data processing steps on the fly that extract and transform data into the same structure.
* Add location distance filters.
* Expand beyond jobs to monitor personalized data like events or real estate. Imagine using AI to rate local events from multiple sources based on your preferences, considering factors like your interests and distance from home.
* Smaller improvements based on your feedback :)

                              <span>I haven&#x27;t used linux for about 10 years and recently installed Slackware 15 on an older Windows 7 machine and it runs great.
 I used to know how to create ipfilter rules, but can&#x27;t quite remember off hand, although it wouldn&#x27;t be hard to look it up.
 So is ipfilter still the default way to setup a firewall?
 Are they needed? Firewalls?
 I used to basically DENY everything on the 3 chains and then explicitly let through certain things like my browser, etc?
 Thanks

                              <span>Hello, so I was trying to build a custom wheel of Onnx Runtime and my computer completely crashed and rebooted on its own.
 During boot, it said something about hardware and then on another screen, something about (username) ttyl
 Weird but I thought nevermind, I&#x27;ll do it again. On the second attempt, I updated/upgraded packages as usual and two words in the terminal caught my eye &quot;initramsfs&quot; and &quot;grub&quot;. I remembered this because I had some issues booting into Linux in another computer.
 Regardless, I tried building the wheel again and once again, computer hard crashed/reboot. 
 I reset my bios settings but this time it booted straight into Windows. I never got the Grub screen.
 I booted into BIOS but it won&#x27;t show my Linux boot option. Used the Boot Repair option in a live usb twice and Linux will still not show up in boot options.
 I also tried the fsck command on my root drive but it said it was mounted, even thought I used the sudo umount command before that.
 Can someone tell me why building an image may have crashed my computer and why I can&#x27;t boot into Linux?
 Edit 2: Booted in with a live usb again and ran sudo fack /dev/sda2 and it returned clean, 1901093/16416768 files, 29049565, 65636608 blocks

                              <span>Hi.
 I am using a shared multiprocessor Xeon E31220 machine, this machine has the average load values below.
 load averages: 110.23 40.42 22.23
 Do you think it is overloaded to be scared?
 Do you suggest changing providers?
 Thanks

                              <span>Yo, I threw together a little &quot;plugin&quot; for zsh/bash (and probably any POSIX-compatible shell) that helps work with multiple git repositories that have different &quot;main&quot; branch names – master and main obviously.
 Recently, various projects have been using both main and master as the name of the &quot;main&quot; branch in the project. This adds a bit of mess in my UX.
 This &quot;plugin&quot; keeps track of the status of some git subcommands that require a branch name (switch, checkout, merge, rebase, log are now supported).
 If you mistype the branch name, this tool will try to correct the command.
 For example: You type git switch main, but the main branch does not exist in the current repo – BranchFixer will correct the branch name to master.
 Thus, git switch master will be executed instead of git switch main.
 If it&#x27;s useful to anyone, use it :)

 P.S. PRs and ideas for improvements are welcome

                              <span>On my linux server i have all my partitions (all but /boot) encrypted via LUKS. I have also installed dropbear to remotely unlock the disk after reboot via SSH.
 Sometimes the power goes out and my server will reboot after getting power again but stops booting as the decryption password will be needed.
 I want to automate the process by providing the server with the decryption password over network. First i wrote a script which tries to unlock the system remotely every couple of minutes via cron. This works but is not a very good solution.
 I want a solution where the server pulls the password from another server automatically. 
 How would i go about writing an initramfs script which tries to access another server, pull the password from there and unlock itself via that password?
 Or does it make sense to try to alter the dropbear initramfs files so that it pulls the password from another server. https://ubuntu.pkgs.org/22.04/ubuntu-universe-amd64/dropbear-initramfs_2020.81-5_all.deb.html 
 I can not use a UPS and i do not want to save the password in plaintext on the machine itself for obvious reasons.

 So my question is, if you can achieve a similar ecosystem with for example a linux laptop and your mobile? Is it possible to have an ecosystem as with apple/samsung products but with a linux machine instead?

                              <span>As the title suggests. I goofed when I was trying to restore windows 10 after unsuccessfully attempting to dual boot win10 and Ubuntu 22.04 and have been using linux for a few months now. Lately I’ve been trying to find a way to restore win10 so I could properly dual boot but instead I accidentally lost the partition altogether and now I can’t boot either OS, all it says is “No bootable device — Please restart system”. A bit scared because I may have just lost quite a bit of files + my ledger live application. Any help would be greatly appreciated.

                              <span>I installed linux mint on both of my laptops last night and just fell in love at first sight. I&#x27;ve only used PopOs, Manjaro and Arch before. I started to think that maybe I should replace my Manjaro install on my main PC with mint(cinnamon).
 I was wondering what are some of the most common and biggest issues with mint and the cinnamon de.

Red Hat&#x27;s public source code offerings for Red Hat Enterprise Linux never met the standard clear, corresponding source code to satisfy the requirements of its copyleft licenses, and they were never intended to. Only the most recent minor branch for each version was ever updated. Red Hat, then as now, satisfied these requirements through its paid support channels.
 
As long as Red Hat publicly provided this source code, it was a de facto Red Hat endorsement of any unmodified rebuild of its code; a rebuilder could demonstrate his source pack…</span>

to express many of the relationships between fields in a data structure.
That gap can be at least partially filled, though, if one is willing to
create and use non-standard extensions.  The adoption of of those
extensions, in the form of the __counted_by() macro, has been
merged for the 6.5 kernel release, even though the compiler feature it
depends on has not yet been finalized.</span>

                              <span>Snap 设计者开发用 Flatpak 替换 Snap 的脚本

已经离开 Canonical 公司的 Alan Pope 是 Snap 软件包格式的共同开发者。Flatpak 和 Snap 都是一种沙盒容器式的软件包格式，旨在提供一种独立于发行版的打包格式，解决包依赖问题，能在不导致依赖地狱的情况下在同一个系统上安装同一个程序的多个版本。Flatpak 是由红帽主导推出的。相比 Snap 只能使用 Canonical 私有的软件包商店，Flatpak 可以支持多个软件仓库。最新的 Ubuntu 23.04 中默认移除了 Flatpak 格式的支持。Alan Pope 开发了一个名为 unsnap 的脚本，如果一个 Snap 软件包存在对应的 Flatpak 包，那么它将会自动用 Flatpak 包替换 Snap 包。

老王点评：这个脚本并不复杂，作者也坦诚并不成熟。有趣是，作为 Snap 包格式的共同作者之一，他推出这样的脚本。




红帽为 RHEL 7 再增加四年的支持

红帽企业 Linux 7（RHEL 7）发布于 2014 年。所有 RHEL 的大版本都遵循标准的十年生命周期，前五年是全面支持，后五年是维护支持。此后，RHEL 进入延长生命周期阶段，红帽为其提供延长生命周期支持。也就是说，从 2024 年 7 月 1 日开始，红帽将为有需要的客户提供 4 年的 RHEL 7 延长支持服务。顺便提一句，RHEL 7 的下一个版本，RHEL 8 及其下游的 CentOS 8 已经在 2021 年 结束支持，原因大家都知道，是为了给 CentOS Stream 让路。


消息来源：红帽



老王点评：看来当时没有及时迁移到 RHEL 8/CentOS 8 的很多人仍然坚守在 7 上。




首个完全由人工智能生成的药物进入临床试验

一家总部位于香港的生物技术初创公司利用人工智能创造了一种治疗特发性肺纤维化的药物。这种导致肺部结疤的慢性疾病，如果不加以治疗，可在 2 至 5 年内导致死亡。该公司称，“这是第一个进入人体临床试验的完全生成型人工智能药物，特别是与病人进行的第二阶段试验。……该药物是第一个既有人工智能发现的新目标，又有人工智能生成的新设计的药物”。该药物目前已经在中国开展为期 12 周的随机、双盲、安慰剂对照试验。

                              <span>Clipboard 是一个有用的开源工具，具有许多可提高你的工作效率的功能。




想要一个新的智能剪贴板管理器吗？ 🤔

这就是 Clipboard 项目 背后的人们对其剪贴板管理器的看法。他们称之为“第二大脑”，可以随时随地记住任何事情。

你认为呢？ 让我们看一下：

Clipboard：概述 ⭐



Clipboard 主要用古老的 C++ 编程语言编写，提供了许多功能，例如复制/粘贴文本、文件、目录、二进制数据、无限剪贴板等等！

此外，它 与主要的 GUI 剪贴板系统无缝集成 并支持西班牙语、葡萄牙语和土耳其语等语言。

让我向你展示它是如何工作的。


📋 由于这是一个基于终端的应用，因此你必须使用各种命令来操作 Clipboard。


因此，你要做的第一件事是使用以下命令复制文件的内容：

cb copy &#x27;filename&#x27;




然后进行粘贴，你可以使用以下命令：

cb paste




要加载所有剪贴板，你可以使用以下命令：

cb show




最后，最吸引我们注意的功能是最近添加的 无限剪贴板历史记录 功能。

你可以使用此命令访问完整的剪贴板历史记录：

cb hs




这个剪贴板应该会 吸引那些更喜欢使用基于终端的应用 而不是基于 GUI 的应用的用户。它提供了非常简单的用户体验以及所有合适的工具。

不要忘了，它包含的功能比我讨论的更多，其中包括：


制作脚本来自动化你的工作流程

能够粘贴你拥有的每种类型的数据，包括二进制数据


那些喜欢图形界面的应用的人可以选择 Pano 剪贴板管理器。它是一个轻量级的剪贴板管理器，与 GNOME 集成得很好。

📥 获取 Clipboard

你可以通过从 GitHub 获取或浏览其 官方网站 开始你的剪贴板之旅。它还包含所有必要的安装指南和文档。

                              <span>新的 Anaconda Web UI 安装程序可能会随 Fedora 工作站 39 一同推出。




长期以来，Fedora 的安装体验一直未曾改变。

然而，这个新的 Web UI 安装程序已经开发了一年多的时间，现在离正式实现的目标更近了。

为什么现在是时候了？

在我们上次 了解 即将到来的 Anaconda WebUI 安装程序时，它的进展相当不错。

而现在，它已经提交了一份 变更提案，旨在将这个安装程序添加到 Fedora 工作站中，以提供现代化的用户体验。该提案正等待 Fedora 工程和指导委员会（FESCo）的审查。

让我们再次来看看即将到来的安装程序和提案，以及可以期待在 Fedora 发布中看到它的时间。

Anaconda WebUI：概述 ⭐



目前 Fedora 使用的旧的安装程序是基于 GTK3 的，在许多情况下已被证明效率低下和不安全。新的 Anaconda WebUI 安装程序旨在解决这个问题。

它使用了一个由 Anaconda 团队开发的 基于 PatternFly 的现代后端和用户界面。

后端由 Python、DBus、Cockpit、React 和 PatternFly 组成，旨在从一开始解决许多已知的用户体验问题，并为一致的安装体验铺平了道路。

变更提案还提到了新 UI 的一些关键亮点，包括：


向导式解决方案而非中心轮毂式。

新的欢迎屏幕用于选择语言（将从系统中配置的语言预先选择）。

时区和日期配置。

磁盘选择。

引导式分区。

配置审核。

安装进度。

内置帮助。


主要关注的重点是向用户提供类似向导的体验，提供更多信息，并帮助他们更好地完成安装过程。

这个新安装程序添加了很多功能，听起来是一个很好的用户体验改变！ 😃

那么，我们可以期待什么时候呢？

由于这个变更需要经过 FESCo 的批准，一切取决于投票过程的进行。

但是，我相当有信心这个变更会得到批准，因为 变更提案 已经设定了 在 Fedora 39 中发布新的 Anaconda WebUI 安装程序 的目标。

💬 这个变更批准只是时间问题；您对此有什么看法？

在今日的思想界，霍布斯被视为不可或缺的重要思想家。他所建立的近代社会契约论框架成为现代政治制度的重要来源。不过，正如意大利哲学家诺伯特·博比奥（Norberto Bobbio）所指出的，对霍布斯的再解释更多是二十世纪的结果。在此之前，霍布斯更多被视为不入流的哲学家，是对乃师培根的拙劣模仿。黑格尔的《哲学史讲演录》将霍布斯的思想视为肤浅的经验主义，认为其中缺乏真正的哲学。博比奥诙谐地写道：“那些年里，霍布斯被毫无根据地指控为极权主义国家的先驱。前述霍布斯政治思想研究的最重要成果之一出自一位政治上可疑的作者卡尔·施密特之手。”
《霍布斯与自然法传统》是博比奥关于霍布斯研究数十年结果的集合。作为意大利重要的霍布斯研究者，博比奥认为自然法在霍布斯的政治哲学中占据最为关键的地位。通过将前政治状态转移到自然状态中，霍布斯得以建立自然状态-政治状态的结构演化模型。霍布斯是一个绝对主义者，但也是一个理性主义者。通过彻底的计算理性推论，霍布斯为现代政治找到了一条不依赖于神学的途径。国家不是自然的产物，而是人类的创造。“如果我们接受人类受命改正自然，而不仅仅是模仿自然的话，那么建立国家就是他们作为能工巧匠的能力的最为高尚和最为高贵的表达。”
不过，由于《霍布斯与自然法传统》一书是由博比奥多年来关于霍布斯的文章拼凑而成，所以章节之间没有明显的联系，讨论的内容也显得较为驳杂。对该书的评价更多着眼于他在霍布斯研究一些基本问题上的立场和看法，而非完整的体系论证。
自然状态与自然法
霍布斯的自然状态一直是所有学者研究的重点。即便是不曾读过霍布斯作品的非专业人士，也对霍布斯所描述的“一切人反对一切人”式的自然状态有所耳闻。其中的关键问题在于，这种自然状态究竟是一种纯粹的理论假设…</span>

                              <span>Howdy y&#x27;all, we&#x27;ve all heard of weird stories of porting Linux to a toaster or whatever. I think it&#x27;s such a great example of the benefits of open-source software but I don&#x27;t know of many instances. 
 So I was wondering what are some of the most niche and unexpected devices people have successfully ported Linux to? Whether it&#x27;s obscure hardware like a calculator watch, or just getting Linux to run on some ancient archaic system, anything that highlights the utility of open-source by adapting Linux to work in crazy environments. 
 Thanks :)

                              <span>Hi,
 I&#x27;m looking to build a new equipment and I would like some advice on it. I won&#x27;t play on it so I&#x27;m going small size and no dedicated GPU. The use will be navigating the web, watch videos, downloads,... No gaming, no video editing or anything very intensive.
 I know an Intel i3 would be enough but I want something more powerfull and I can&#x27;t decide between an i5-12400 and a Ryzen 5700G. Which one will perform better with Linux? (I can&#x27;t tell you which distro because I distrohop like I&#x27;m posessed so I usually go with Mint, XFCE or KDE).
 The case I&#x27;m thinking of is this one:
 Sparrow MQ4
 So I don&#x27;t need PSU and the motherboard should be ITX.
 What do you think about the CPU?
 Cheers.

 I don&#x27;t like snapd to user packags on ubuntu based systems. But canonical devs are forcing snapd for lxd (its machine container thingy)
 I want to build .deb package from the below source
 https://github.com/lxc/lxd/releases
 How do I create .deb file from above source? (don&#x27;t want to do make and make install. Just want to create .deb file and distribute among my team so they can setup on theie machines)

                              <span>I use Ubuntu and it works pretty well however whenever I see it discussed on Reddit, there always seems to be some kind of hatred toward it along with some random mentions of snaps and something about how they&#x27;ve &quot;graduated&quot; to a different distro or something. Why are snaps bad and why is Ubuntu hated on Reddit?

                              <span>I have been a Linux user since the year 2019. I used to run Linux on my all-in-one PC, which had an Intel CPU without any dedicated GPU. The experience there was perfect; I had zero complaints with any of the distributions I tried, but the story changed when I recently bought a gaming laptop with an RTX 3050.
 As expected, the first thing I did was to remove Windows and try to install Fedora on it. At first, the live USB wouldn&#x27;t even boot because of the missing GPU drivers, so I tried the safe graphics mode, and then, after completing the install, I added the Nvidia drivers. In the beginning, it worked fine, but after some time, performance issues started to occur. Sometimes the OS freezes on the login screen or gives me a blank screen after I enter my password and press enter.
 I was determined that I wanted to use Linux because I like the playing around and freedom that it gives the user, so I tried other distros based on Fedora, RHEL, Ubuntu, and even Arch. I tried different DEs and switched between X11 and Wayland, but everything always gave me some kind of performance dip or left my laptop unresponsive just because of the GPU.
 In the past, when I used Linux on my PC and an old laptop that didn&#x27;t have a GPU, it always worked fine, but now I am forced to use Windows just because Nvidia has a shitty Linux support.
 At this point I am tired of trying to configure everything by myself and yet getting no results, but I really want to move away from windows so if you guys got any suggestions, I am open to that.

 I have citra installed through emudeck, it will launch through steam and it will launch through using the command &quot;flatpak run org.citra_emu.citra&quot; but it WILL NOT launch through the desktop shortcut or from the discovery store or the apps list in the start/windows menu. Wtf is the problem? It&#x27;s giving me a real headache. 
 Also I know there&#x27;s two citras in the discover store, there wasnt before and i alresdy had the problem, I tried installing it through the flathub install command to try fix the problem, it didn&#x27;t work.
 I also tried uninstalling and reinstalling through both emudeck and the discover store

                              <span>Here&#x27;s my issue, every time i work on the look of my computers i end up having to propagate changes to a ton of files. Usually while programming you&#x27;d want your data that&#x27;s used in multiple places to be anchored to variables.
 I&#x27;m kinda struggling to find a general purpose way of transfering colors, fonts, sizes, across very different applications i.e. terminal, i3config, gtk...
 I&#x27;m not a top notch programmer but i&#x27;m not an idiot either. I&#x27;ve mulled over the issue for a little while and would like opinions before commiting to what i&#x27;d consider to be a sizeable amount of work.
 I&#x27;m not comming here empty handed either.
 Take the terminal for instance: gogh has a build process that uses yaml for theme definitions, python for generation/building and bash for installation. It would be pretty easy to use/hijack the build process by simply generating a yaml def.
 For anything that&#x27;s css-like: a tool like sass or similar is perfect, i&#x27;d just have to include my variables. I&#x27;ve seen a couple gtk themes using this.
 Any other configuration that uses text files should be trivial, i&#x27;m just uncertain what would be the least painful approach.
 Preprocessing options i&#x27;ve been coming across are: - awk / sed - probably the most painful approach imo - gpp - first time using it but seems to be a good powerful solution - node using gulp or grunt and whatever other rendering tool - i have some experience with this toolset but i feel it&#x27;s not suited for the task and at this point any programming language that has printf/template strings would give the same result.
 What i&#x27;m considering is using make to process sources into a build/staging folder and then letting each &#x27;facet&#x27; of themeing run their own build processes if needed.
 So what approach have you been using to tackle this problem?

But seriously, what do y&#x27;all think it is? I&#x27;m not talking about HDMI or anything like that, by the way. Just mouse (and/or keyboard) recording to replay.

I tried on Fedora, CentOS, Ubuntu, and Debian. I figured Id try mailspring and that installed and launches but I cant add an @outlook.com out. Can any have a reliable mail client they use which does not require snap? (flatpak is ok)

 Lot of opinions about all of this. I&#x27;m quite curious how it&#x27;ll all play out, but Suse coming out with their thoughts is certainly noteworthy, I think. Wonder if Canonical will have a statement anytime soon.

                              <span>I want to summarize a few thought about this subject, that I have been commenting around (like everyone else) on different threads. 
 On one hand, I absolutely respect the FOSS culture, and what those countless developers have done to push Linux over the years. Tails is probably one of the biggest example of it, and how important it can be for everyone else to have projects like this.
 Nonetheless, I think that many of our well known influencers (aka the YouTubers) aren&#x27;t considering the importance of profit and business culture for the long term survival, and development of Linux as a whole. Valve, Canonical, Red Hat IBM, System76, Tuxedo, etc. they all have different approaches, but they understand that to go further, they can´t rely on donations and patrons forever. Probably they have m…</span>

 I had no experience with anything other than Windows when i bought myself a Raspberry Pi 3B+.
 I had an awesome time using it, and looking back on it I&#x27;d say it was the only time I ever had a great time with Linux, and didn&#x27;t have any real issues.
 A year later I started to dual boot Linux on my Laptop. I installed Debian, accidentally wiped the entire SSD, everything worked fine, reinstalled Windows &amp; Debian after noticing it. After booting into Debian I&#x27;d get a kernel panic every time, with pulseaudio maxing out one core. I googled the error messages, didn&#x27;t find any actual fix, so I gave up and used Ubuntu instead. Saying that I had a bad start with desktop Linux would be an understatement.
 Ubuntu didn&#x27;t go too bad…</span>

 Linux/FOSS doesn&#x27;t need inexperienced and uninformed people pretending to practice law on their blog or in the comments, especially as their blog or comments will be parroted ad infinitum by similarly inexperienced and uninformed people here. And although the SFC has had some bad legal takes, that&#x27;s not my core problem with the SFC&#x27;s recent blog post.
 To set the scene -- can you imagine being an open source developer, and a non-profit, focused on open source license compliance, decides to take issue with, not your compliance with a license, but to moralize about your business model? I couldn&#x27;t be…</span>

GIMP 3.0 今年有望发表候选版本

最近，GIMP 的主要开发者们召开了自 2019 年来的首次开发者会议，“Wilber Week”。这是一个为期一周的会议，在阿姆斯特丹的 Blender 基金会总部举行。根据会议发布的信息，看起来他们可能会在今年至少开始 GIMP 3.0 的候选版本阶段。目前正在开发的是 GIMP 2.99.16 版本。作为备受期待的对 GTK3 的移植，以及作为 Photoshop 的开源替代品的一系列其他改进，GIMP 3.0 已经酝酿了十年。会议还讨论了可能成立 GIMP 基金会的计划。

远程工作使美国人的生产力下降

美国劳工统计局的新数据发现，2022 年有三分之一的美国人在家工作，高于 2019 年的四分之一。调查还发现，在家全职工作的美国人比在办公室的美国人每天少工作 2.5 小时。如果人们回到办公室，像 2019 年一样每天工作 8.2 小时，而不是每天在家的 5.7 小时，那么美国经济就会增加了大约 8 亿周的工作量，即提升 8%。

基于我对 RHEL 和其他红帽产品的热爱，我不得不现在表达一些严厉的看法。我之所以这样做，是因为我希望 RHEL [及/或其克隆版] 对每个人都是 可获得的。

请原谅这次我用词有些激烈，因为我从内心不希望 RHEL 成为 对业余爱好者不可及 的产品。免费的 RHEL 开发者许可证只是转移话题而已，相比于 真正的 RHEL 克隆版存在的时候，它削弱了 广大动手爱好者社区 的热情。


🗒️ 对于我的使用场景来说，使用免费订阅的 RHEL 使我感到满意。实际上，我正在使用的就是免费订阅。本文是关于如果保持这种状态会对 RHEL 产生怎样的影响。


快速回顾：事情是如何走到这一步的

我相信你现在都已经知道为什么红帽公司最近频频出现在新闻中：

但是，如果你对正在发生的事情一无所知，让我给你一个快速时间线的指引，帮助你理解：


红帽公司拥有一个出色的 Linux 发行版，名为 红帽企业 LinuxRed Hat Enterprise Linux（RHEL），支持周期长达 10 年。

与其他任何 Linux 发行版一样，用于构建 RHEL（或 RHEL 的 克隆版）的源代码是公开可用的。

CentOS 利用上述源代码，去除商标，并创建了一个几乎 1 比 1 的 RHEL 拷贝。（我说“几乎”是因为 RHEL 的商标 必须 被删除。）

那些不愿意支付费用只是为了第一次尝试 RHEL 的爱好者社区，现在可以使用 CentOS 来看看是否喜欢它。

公园是十九世纪中期西方为因应工业革命带来的城市问题而创造的产物，它是现代都市之心，是城市规划中始终挥之不去的乌托邦理想。在中国，“公园”一词古已有之，指称的却是官家园林，与西方public park的概念完全不同。中山大学中文系副教授林峥的《公园北京》考察公园作为一个新兴的西方文明装置如何进入近代北京的过程。以公园为视角，该书呈现了晚清至民国北京政治、社会、历史、文化、文学诸方面纷繁复杂的变革。近日，《上海书评》专访了林峥，请她谈谈与近代北京公园互为表里的文化生产与文学想象。

《公园北京：文化生产与文学想象（1860-1937）》，林峥著，北京大学出版社，2022年10月出版，408页，79.00元

您认为公园作为西方文明装置，进入近代北京，体现了另一种现代性。您对这种现代性的解释是以旧纳新、以新化旧，它表现为最旧的帝国遗迹同时也是最新的公共场域，表现为在外观古色古香的建筑内部引入现代设施。为什么这是“另一种”现代性？
林峥：现代性的概念源自西方，与都市相伴相生，纷繁复杂，中国对于现代性的理解，主要体现为晚清五四以来一种以西方（启蒙现代性）为模板的、线性进步的发展观。这样建立在西方启蒙传统加诸被曲解的社会达尔文主义之上的对于现代性的理解，容易造成一味趋新、趋西的心态。同时我认为，中国在现代化、都市化的过程中有自身独特的发展脉络，若以西方的现代性理论轨范中国城市，很难完全解释与涵盖中国的经验，这也是我为何选择“公园北京”作为研究对象的原因。
一方面，公园是西方现代都市文明的象征，清末民初的政府、启蒙知识分子也是从这个思路出发，将公园引进中国；但另一方面，近代北京的公园又不是另起炉灶、照搬西式，而是在前朝皇家园林坛庙的基础上改造开放，这造就了近代北京公园的特殊性。它的风景情致是中式的，内在精神又是现代的，既是最旧的帝国遗迹，也是最新的公共场域。可与之相对比…</span>

                              <span>Hey everyone,
 Probably a stupid question here. Had been using Zorin OS 16 off and on for the past year or so but recently upgraded to a 7900 XT. Needed a more up to date distro so was looking into Fedora. Not the biggest fan of the standard gnome layout so I was trying the new Budgie spin but there doesn’t seem to be an option to enable the Third Party Repository?
 I had previously installed the standard Fedora and it asked me during setup, didn’t for the Budgie. Not even an option in the software store settings like i’ve seen in all the guides. Is this just available in standard Fedora Workstation? Is this just a Budgie thing? Or am I just a big dummy missing something obvious.

                              <span>For years, the tearing protocol has been one of the most controversial features regarding Wayland. Competitive gamers didn&#x27;t want forced vsync for latency reasons so they kept using Xorg, and many many posts have been made regarding this situation. Only recently it was merged into the Wayland protocol but seemengly no compositor was using it.
 After updating my system about a week ago (notably with the new Nvidia 535 driver), I launched Nier Automata with direct scanout enabled in Hyprland&#x27;s config file and... surprise! There&#x27;s no forced vsync and I can notice tearing. I decided to test League of Legends too and it definitely works, I can now uncap my framerate and get it to ~400fps, but if it drops below my monitor&#x27;s refresh rate (144Hz) tearing is noticeable.
 So... isn&#x27;t this supposed to be a big thing? Why is no one talking about it?

                              <span>I am struggling to understand a specific question about linux bridge networking and I can&#x27;t quite find an answer on the internet.
 I have a server I have put together with Debian linux as the OS. I set it up so that there is a linux software bridge in NetworkManager/nmtui and then added interface eno1 as a slave device to the bridge nm-bridge.
 The bridge has its own MAC address distinct from the eno1 actual physical ethernet device. That&#x27;s all fine.
 As I picture this in my head, I picture the nm-bridge device as like a physical layer 2 managed switch and the eno1 ethernet port as a computer connected to one of the ports of that managed switch. Then any VM&#x27;s I create in virt-manager I also assign to nm-bridge an these are just equivalent to new computers being plugged into the layer 2 man…</span>

                              <span>Using infinity, has anybody else&#x27;s apps stopped working? I figured there was a lag when it was still working around 0200 in my timezone but it is still working half a day later.
 Did reddit rollback their decision or something?

 Just on a short note:
 - Recently we acquired Linux.Forum and have set up our Linux.Chat Support Forums
 - We&#x27;ve repurposed Linux.Community as a Linux and open source focussed Lemmy instance (Reddit-like) 
 This brings our community count to 5:
 &#x3D;&gt; #linux on Libera.Chat
 &#x3D;&gt; Linux.Chat on Discord
 &#x3D;&gt; @linux.social (Mastodon instance)
 &#x3D;&gt; Linux.Chat Support Forums (on linux.forum)
 &#x3D;&gt; Linux.Chat Communities (on linux.community)
 A Matrix instance is coming at some time in the future as soon as we&#x27;ve moved our moderation bot architecture to something a bit more platform agnostic.

                              <span>I have a Tandberg RDX dock and a few of these vendor locked 2.5&quot; HDDs. They work fine but if my dock dies I will lose access to my data. The theory is these drives have custom firmware, but I believe it&#x27;s just as simple as a serial number pair for the drives and dock, plus a 256 bit SATA drive password.
 Installing one of these drives in a PC and attempting to boot from it results in a password prompt. The first 4,096 sectors are supposedly reserved and cannot be read by the host PC over USB. Some people have reported certain Linux tools would allow them to reset the SATA password but I&#x27;m not sure this is true. Others have claimed &quot;true&quot; drive cloners could access and dump these reserved sectors, assuming that is true as well.
 This video discusses it but it&#x27;s nearly a decade old, when these products were relatively new. Has anyone made any tools to dump these sectors, reset the SATA passwords, or do a more complete wipe of these cartidges to make them usable as standard SATA drives?

                              <span>I consider cross-platform for PC software as Linux, Windows and x86 Mac.
 I&#x27;ve tried a bit of AutoKey, not a lot. AutoHotkey I&#x27;ve used for a while, it does allow creating UI&#x27;s, but it feels wrong. It&#x27;s not cross-platform.
 What would you consider a good solution or stack to create similar functionality?
 What functionality? Good question. AutoHotkey and AutoKey let you remap, input devices. I&#x27;m not going to say all input devices, but it seems possible. So you hit Mouse4 on your mouse and that could do anything, like press, (Ctrl+~ ; htop) for a quick htop macro if using something like a quake-mode terminal. You do have to manually type each macro by hand. So asking what functionality is it just letting the user type some hotkey in a text file, or is it a UI letting them record a macro, ala vim style.
 I&#x27;d rather it be easier for the user and they can choose, a UI or CLI + user created macro file, both options able to be used on demand.
 I&#x27;m sure I could name any language or libs/stack and someone could find a way to create it using that. What would you suggest?
 EDIT:
 Came across a post mentioning Python as a possible replacement for AutoHotkey and how it&#x27;s faster to create a UI. It&#x27;s not about that for me or this project. The primary goal is cross-platform OSS, if it can&#x27;t do that, it&#x27;s not comparable. To me the only difficulty would be finding a library that already has the ability to accept any form of user input from any input device. If the language doesn&#x27;t offer that, then that language is not an option as this isn&#x27;t a driver-level project.
 What about something like QMK firmware found on some advanced keyboards? If you know what I just said, fist bump. If you&#x27;re familiar with Steam Input and how that lets you configure controllers, that&#x27;s a bit like QMK firmware. That&#x27;s the goal, to let the user be able to do anything with their devices. I&#x27;m ignorant if some library like that exists, you think a gamedev would be able to better answer the question?

                              <span>I was reminded of the existence of Suse (and Suse Linux Enterprise Server, to be exact) while reading through some articles about Red Hat and their shenanigans. I&#x27;ve been in tech for 20+ years in various fields, in the US, and I have never, ever heard anyone even mention Suse as a candidate distro. I know it&#x27;s because they market in Europe primarily, but still -- from the looks of it they are solid enterprise option. 
 So, is there any reason why, say, a US company who is considering alternatives to CentOS/RHEL, not to consider SLES?

                              <span>I recently switched to Ubuntu as my primary OS(have been using ubuntu for a year but used windows primarily). I used a fix(https://www.cmscritic.com/how-to-fix-nvidia-screen-tearing-in-xfce-mate-kde-lxde-and-others/) for the screen tearing It worked out too perfectly as even with vsync off in every single game(CS:GO, Minecraft.......) there is no screen tearing at all. I am curious to know why is that. I have been struggling with screen tearing on Windows with vsync off and I am never switching again to Windows.

                        <a class="article-summary-link article-summary-box-outer" href="https://www.williamlong.info/archives/7213.html">
                          <div class="article-summary-box-inner media-object">
                            <span class="media-object__text">
                              <span>马斯克当地时间7月1日表示，为了阻止“极端水平”的数据抓取和系统操纵，推特正在限制用户可阅读的推文数量：已验证的账户限制在每天阅读6000条推文，未验证的账户限制在每天600条推文，未验证的新账户限制在每天300条推文。 ​​​


当地时间7月1日，数以万计的用户抱怨推特没有发布他们的新推文，用户会收到“超出限制”的错误提示。


在一条推文中，马斯克详细介绍了修改后的使用配额。经过验证的帐户每天最多可以浏览6000条推文，而未经验证的账户则最多浏览600条推文。新注册的未经验证的账户面临着更严格限制，每天最多发300条推文。


随后，马斯克又发布一条推文称，很快，已验证的账户浏览推文数量的限制将增加到8000条，未验证的账户将增加到800条，新注册的未验证用户将增加到400条。


马斯克表示，推特正在努力应对“极端程度的数据抓取”和“系统操纵”。他说，这些新的限制是遏制这些紧迫问题的重要措施。他没有透露谁在抓取推特的数据，也没有说明这个问题持续了多长时间和详细解释系统如何被操纵。


马斯克此前曾对推特上的数据抓取表示担忧，并暗示他可能会对不良行为者采取行动。今年4月，他对微软“非法”使用推特数据表示愤怒，显然是指微软与人工智能公司OpenAI的合作，OpenAI在“来自互联网的大量不同文本数据集”上训练人工智能模型，马斯克说，“他们非法训练使用推特数据。诉讼时间到了。”


这并不是推特近几个月来遇到的第一个技术问题，也不是第一个为解决问题而设计的非常规解决方案。本周早些时候，推特开始限制未登录帐户的用户通过桌面和移动设备上的网络浏览器访问推文和个人资料。

在一篇由中科院、中科大的研究人员发表的论文中，详细介绍了他们在 5 小时内设计出一个新的工业规模的 RISC-V CPU 的工作。据称，这要比人类团队完成类似的 CPU 设计快 1000 倍左右。该 CPU 的设计是 “仅从外部输入-输出观察中形成的，而不是正式的程序代码”。它还拥有令人印象深刻的 11 个 9 的的准确性。该 CPU 采用 65 纳米制造，可以以高达 300MHz 的速度运行。他们在该 CPU 上运行了 Linux 内核 5.15 的操作系统，基准测试显示该 CPU 性能大约与 i486 相当。研究人员认为，他们“从头发现了冯-诺伊曼架构”。

老王点评：重要的不是设计出来的芯片有多强，而是 AI 可以这么快就完成了芯片设计，而且走了一条不同的设计道路。更好的是，这是国内的团队完成的研究。




为什么 Mastodon 无法取代 Twitter

即使 Twitter 用户体验多么糟糕，它的老板多么令人讨厌，它的用户仍然留在那里，去中心化微博客替代 Mastodon 未能吸引到更多 Twitter 用户。一位前 Mastodon 实例管理员解释了其中的原因：对于绝大多数用户而言 Mastodon 没有独特的卖点，从功能上讲它本质上是 2008 年的 Twitter，而从功能角度看 2023 年的 Twitter 能让绝大多数用户满意；对 99% 的用户来说去中心化不是卖点，就像绝大多数用户不在意开源或自由软件，在意识形态上也不反对私有软件；去中心化让用户体验糟糕；管理 Mastodon 的人对现状感到满意，他们认为其他人只需要接受就行，新用户无法将他们的体验反馈给管理者，他们会选择离开；Mastodon 扩展性不行，其用户群只接受慈善不接受其它任何资助模式；在很大程度上，Mastodon 的文化是排外的。

老王点评：去中心化并不是灵丹妙药，甚至我觉得它可能会一直处于非主流，虽然它的存在是非常必要的。




谷歌决定不支付加拿大的“链接税”

加拿大通过了《在线新闻法》，要求谷歌和 Facebook 为简单地显示新闻链接付费，而其他人都是免费的。谷歌和 Facebook 都拒绝了加拿大的要求，它们都决定从其平台上删除加拿大的新闻内容。谷歌称，“对链接进行定价（所谓的‘链接税’）的史无前例的决定，为我们的产品带来了不确定性，并使我们仅仅因为方便加拿大人获取加拿大出版商的新闻而面临不设上限的财务责任。”谷歌在 2021 年 1 月对澳大利亚的 “链接税” 法律采取了类似的立场，但谷歌在几周后就同意为澳大利亚的新闻付费。此外，谷歌还同意向法国新闻网站支付费用。而美国也正在制定类似的法律。

老王点评：看来“吃大户”的想法哪里都有，就像还有些人准备让大型 IT 公司额外负担光缆的费用一样。但是从另外一个方面看，似乎这些具有垄断性质的 IT 巨头，应该承担更多的责任和付出。你怎么看呢？</span>

                              <span>以下是如何将用户添加到 Debian Linux 中的 SUDOERS 组的方法。


在 Debian Linux 中，SUDOERS 组在向用户授予管理权限方面发挥着至关重要的作用。将用户添加到 SUDOERS 组使他们能够以 root 权限执行命令，从而为他们提供必要的管理访问权限以在 Debian 系统上执行各种任务。

在安装 Debian Linux 的过程中，如果你将 root 帐户的密码保留为空，那么系统中的 创建的第一个用户 将拥有管理权限。但是，如果你设置了 root 密码，那么用户名将不具有 sudo 权限。因此，在使用用户帐户执行管理任务时，你可能会遇到以下类似的错误。

 is not in the sudoers file. This incident will be reported.




本文旨在提供有关在 Debian 中向 SUDOERS 组添加用户的分步指南，确保你可以有效地管理用户权限和系统安全。

如何将用户添加到 Debian 中的 SUDOERS 组

要将用户添加到 Debian 中的 SUDOERS 组，请按照以下简单步骤操作：


单击“终端”图标或使用快捷键 Ctrl+Alt+T，打开 Debian 系统上的终端。

使用以下命令切换到 root 用户：


su -


系统将提示你提供 root 密码。输入 root 密码并按回车键。

以 root 用户身份登录后，输入以下命令。确保根据你的用户名进行更改。在此示例中，将 arindam 替换为你的用户名。

/sbin/addgroup arindam sudo


如果上面的命令无效，还可以使用下面的命令：

usermod -aG sudo arindam


按退出离开 root 提示符。注销并重新登录。现在你可以使用你的用户名执行任何管理操作。

另一种方法

你可以使用与下面相同的命令进入 root 帐户。使用 root 账号登录：

su -


然后使用 nano 或 visudo 或任何编辑器打开 /etc/sudoers 文件。

nano /etc/sudoers


添加以下行和用户名。根据你的用户名替换 arindam。

arindam    ALL&#x3D;(ALL)    ALL


保存并关闭文件。然后，注销并重新登录。这应该会给用户名 root 权限。

验证 SUDOERS 组成员

要验证用户是否已成功添加到 SUDOERS 组，你可以打开一个新的终端窗口并输入以下命令。将 arindam 替换为你添加到 SUDOERS 组的用户的实际用户名。

sudo -l -U arindam


如果用户是 SUDOERS 组的成员，你将看到他们拥有的权限列表。这是一个示例，你可以看到我的用户名具有所有访问权限。



结束语

将用户添加到 SUDOERS 组将授予他们重要的管理权限。在授予用户此类访问权限之前，仔细考虑用户的可信度和责任非常重要。sudo 使用不当可能会导致系统意外损坏或受损。

请记住在委派管理权限时要小心谨慎，并定期检查用户权限以维护安全的 Debian 系统。

寺田浩明教授所著《清代传统法秩序》（日文原名为“中国法制史”，以下称“本书”），是近些年中日法制史学界、明清史学界期待已久的著作。本书一经面世，日本《史学杂志》《法制史研究》《中国研究月报》相继刊发了久保茉莉子、森田成满、高见泽磨等重要学者的书评；赵晶教授主持的《中国古代法律文献研究》（第十二辑，社科文献出版社，2018年）在第一时间刊发了本书第八章的译文（黄琴唐译）以及伍跃、阿风、赵思渊、孔令伟四位分别来自社会史、法律史、经济史、“新清史”等领域的学者撰写的书评。
寺田教授自1983年开始发表了一系列在中日两国均具有重要影响的论文。在本书之前，寺田教授唯一的一本书是中文版的论文集：《权利与冤抑：寺田浩明中国法史论集》（清华大学出版社，2012年），收录了他十五篇主要论文，涵盖了其学术生涯二十六篇论文的主要篇章。在寺田教授四十年的学术生涯（从1977年至本书完成的2017年）中，本书只是第二本书，也是唯一一本体系性的著作。
《清代传统法秩序》的结构
作为代表了一个时代的学者，在退休的时候出版了一生唯一的体系性著作，无论对于作者、同侪、读者，都有非同寻常的意义。因此，复述一下本书的基本内容仍是必要的。
在本书中，寺田教授首先给出了一个理解清代法秩序的基本前提，即“早熟的国家与社会的二元性”，将清代定义为由统一的官僚制国家所统辖的“大规模的市场社会、契约社会、诉讼社会”（第4页）。以此理解为基础，全书从家（家族）的实态开始，依序讨论家的经济基础，家与家之间如何建立、发展出社会，而后逐步进入法与裁判的相关问题。
第一章虽名“人与家”，依次延续滋贺秀三（1921-2008）的理论讨论了“同居共财”的家（父亲所统率、代表的近亲者成为一体而经营生活的生活共同体…</span>

                              <span>Pirate Enlightenment, or the Real Libertalia by David Graeber, Allen Lane,  January 2023, 208pp

如果大卫·格雷伯在你心目中是一位无政府主义活动家，“占领华尔街”运动的精神领袖，或者是2018年那本《毫无意义的工作》（Bullshit Jobs）的挥斥方遒的作者，你可能会惊讶地发现，他还写过一本关于海盗和政治思想的书，以十八世纪的马达加斯加（位于非洲东海岸外的巨大岛屿，大约有两个半英国那么大）为背景。
事实上，《海盗启蒙》标志着这位著名的人类学家回归了他最初的兴趣。格雷伯于两年前去世，在他还是一名在读研究生时，曾经花了几年时间去马达加斯加做田野考察。他勾搭上一位当地妇女后，发现她认为自己属于一个独特的族群，其成员的祖先可以追溯到加勒比海盗，这激发了他的兴趣。
后来他在大英图书馆发现了一份未曾发表过的十九世纪初手稿，其中收录了一位法国冒险家所描述的马达加斯加复杂的内部历史的片段。该手稿以一位名为拉齐米拉霍（Ratsimilaho）的传奇人物为中心，这位年轻的战士是一名英国海盗与一名马达加斯加妇女的儿子，在十八世纪初他成为了一场长达十年的战争中的领袖，建立了历史上的贝奇米萨拉卡（Betsimisaraka）邦联——位于马达加斯加东北海岸的一个庞大而崭新的政治实体。
几十年来格雷伯一直围着这份手稿的一个副本打转，但直到他生命的最后阶段，才最终坐下来仔细处理其内容。其成果就是这本篇幅不长但引人入胜的书，之前已经出版了法文和意大利文版。
曾活跃于加勒比海的英国海盗从1690年代开始在马达加斯加北部建立基地，方便他们劫掠。1695年，亨利·艾弗里（又名艾维里）及其船员攻击了一支前往麦加的莫卧儿帝国船队，并俘虏了其中两艘满载财富的船只，从而获得了价值六十万英镑（按今天的币值计算约为一亿英镑）的巨额财宝。
英国和法国政府最终成功打击了这种行径。艾弗里失踪了，其他数百名海盗则退至马达加斯加。逍遥法外的白人亡命徒在某个非洲岛屿上建立个人领地的想法令当时的欧洲人兴奋不已。从伦敦到莫斯科，各国政府都在与所谓的艾弗里的使者进行条约谈判，此时在传言中艾弗里已经成为马达加斯加的海盗国王。当时许多流行说法都是对他行径的描述与发挥。
丹尼尔·笛福就是被此类故事所吸引的人之一。在他出版《鲁滨逊漂流记》的几年后，一本名为《海盗通史》的书于1724年在伦敦上市，可能就是他写的。书中描述了一个奉行平等主义的马达加斯加海盗共和国，名为利伯塔利亚（Libertalia）——一个乌托邦殖民地，由思想自由、生活自由的自由海盗组成，致力于贯彻平等主义，人民直接管治。
格雷伯承认，这种说法被广泛认为是一个寓言，而且关于海盗和当地人在三百年前的马达加斯加究竟如何生活，现存的证据少之又少。但他并未因此而退缩。总体上来说，他的任务是论证我们如何看待欧洲启蒙运动从现在已经被遗忘的非欧洲思想家和社会实践中获得的诸多灵感。他推测，贝奇米萨拉卡邦联可以说某种程度上是现实中的利伯塔利亚，“海盗管治和马达加斯加传统政治文化中一些更具平等主义元素的创造性综合”。
他对这一论点的阐述涉及对马达加斯加政治、性别和社会历史的人类学文献的冗长解析。遗憾的是，格雷伯的论述也夸大了海盗式社会关系的先进性，称其具有真正的革命意义。例如，当笛福描述海盗社区通过抽签选择十二个人来解决争端时，格雷伯兴奋地将此吹嘘为他们新颖的“民主制度”的证据，据说是基于海盗船上独特的平等主义环境。他没有注意到的是，这段描述仅仅是对众所周知的陪审团审判原则的翻版，笛福当年的读者肯定会发现这一点。

《万物的黎明》英文书影

和他最近与大卫·温格罗（David Wengrow）合著的《万物的黎明：人类的新历史》（The Dawn of Everything: A New History of Humanity）一样（那本书在更大的范围内提出了相关的论点），读格雷伯的主要乐趣并不在于要同意他的论点。相反，他通过一系列挑衅性的思想实验，一再迫使我们重新思考我们在当下的生活方式。无论十八世纪的马达加斯加发生过什么，《海盗启蒙》意味着，在我们自己的社会、性别与政治安排中，必然能够更进一步地贯彻自由思考和平等主义。

                              <span>Hi,
 I am just trying to make a script to launch a script that is going to launch both elastic and kibana for the time I need them because it is convinient to have.
 Here is what I have in my sh script
  
(until ([redacted]elasticsearch-8.6.1/bin/elasticsearch &amp;) | grep -q &#x27;shards started&#x27; | head ; do sleep 1; done; echo &#x27;Elastic Started&#x27;);
 (until ([redacted]kibana-8.6.1/bin/kibana &amp;) | grep -q &#x27;Kibana is now available&#x27; | head ; do sleep 1; done; echo &#x27;Kibana Started&#x27;);
  
And it looks nice and it works like for 10-15 minutes, but then after some time I get the following

                              <span>I am still on X11 (don&#x27;t kill me I am still on Nvidia) and was looking for a screen locker. This lead me to a deep rabbit hole of repeated warnings that there is no way to securely do lock screens on X11. Here is an example https://blog.martin-graesslin.com/blog/2015/01/why-screen-lockers-on-x11-cannot-be-secure/
 Majority of the complaints repeat the following as some of the primary reasons
  
X has no concept of screen lockers.
 A screen locker is just another client for X.
 There is no privileged process which acts as the one and only screen locker
 If the locker crashes you have access to the machine.
 On X11: it’s not possible to prevent that other windows grab screen content. (This is something that Wayland can solve that X11 never can)
  
My questions is why don&#x27;t display managers take on the task of locking sessions.
 For instance I use LightDM. It seems to run as root, and is what is starting the X server for me.
 If LightDM (or any similar display manager) had a concept of locking sessions, then wouldn&#x27;t that solve most problems.
  
The display manager could just lock the current session in a given VT
 It will then switch/redirect users to a different VT where the password dialog shows up (this is a different process).
 On successful authentication we can notify the original DM process to unlock the session.
  
Light-locker seems to operate similarly, but LightDM itself does not really seem to know anything about it.
 Obviously we still cannot prevent 5. which is inherent to Xorg, but if I don&#x27;t care about 5. I don&#x27;t see why display managers can&#x27;t do this?

                              <span>I setup a Ubuntu 22 mail server with Postfix to replace a legacy RHEL server. Everything on the SMTP side works as expected. However, needing help with granting SSH access to clients with signed keys.
 The CA authority signs SSH keys. ssh-rsa and ssh-dss signed keys receive the following error on logs
 &#x27;userauth_pubkey: certificate signature algorithm ssh-rsa: signature algorithm not supported [preauth]&#x27;

I added the following two lines to the /etc/ssh/sshd_config but did not resolve the issue
 PubkeyAcceptedKeyTypes +ssh-rsa
 PubkeyAcceptedAlgorithms&#x3D;+ssh-rsa
 ​
 I am not in a position to convert all keys to sha2 at this time, so please help me identify what needs to be changed on the server to temporarily authenticate via ssh-rsa and ssh-dss
 I appreciate any help you can provide.

                              <span>Hello everyone,
 I&#x27;m a Debian family (Ubuntu primarily) user who recently switched to a mechanical keyboard and who is a native italian language speaker.
 The &quot;US Intl. With Dead Keys&quot; layout allows me to type accented characters I need (examples: à è ì ò ù) with just one modifier key right before the non-accented one.
 It works very well but it slows me down. My question is:
 Is there any software/workaround/script that will allow to type a specific defined character every time I double-press something? Example:
  
ee -&gt; should type: è
 oo -&gt; should type: ò
  
Any ideas?
 Thank you!

                              <span>For semantics and curiosity sake, do any of you guys know the following? I’ve done some google searches and wasn’t able to find details on the following question.
 Are there any other Enterprise level distributions (Ubuntu, Suse, etc) that have downstream distributions of their enterprise level offerings? From the exposure I’ve had to Ubuntu, there are some security and live patches and faster security fixes. These features are behind a paywall and presumably eventually end up in the main Ubuntu distribution. I am also not aware of any downstream builds of Ubuntu Pro or Suse Linux Enterprise.
 As I’m NOT an enterprise user putting boxes into production with business on the line, and everything I’m reading is that Centos Stream will likely handle what I’m trying to do without much fuss.
 Am I missing something here? Seems to me that Redhat is aligning their offerings and paywalls similarly to Ubuntu and Suse? Am I oversimplifying this, missing a key detail?

 I use:
 https://www.cloudflare.com/ssl/encrypted-sni/
 All 4 checks are possible now and should be used, i had to edit the about:config on firefox to get the secure SNI working
 https://www.dnsleaktest.com/
 To test my dns setup and check for leak
 https://ipleak.net/
 To check my ip and also check for leaks 
 https://whoer.net/port-scanner-online
 To check for open ports
 I run rkhunter, clamAV, lynis, to check for security issues 
 I just found out about the command sudo rpm --verify -a
 That checks all packages for changes I&#x27;m still learning how to use it
 Im sure there is alot of usefull commands im not aware of 
 What other useful tricks should i be aware of?

 Everyone involved here has unmistakably improved my life, and I&#x27;m sure the lives of others, and has helped me both personally and professionally, even if it&#x27;s directly, or indirectly. I have always enjoyed coming here, where it is to learn, to laugh, to experiment, and to help others. I definitely would be in a much worse position in life without all of you here.

                              <span>Hi all, 
 I&#x27;m facing some issues related to the replacement of the my Macbook Pro early 2015 battery. 
 The story: Few years ago I stopped to use my Macbook and at that time the original battery was at 80% capacity. After 1 year (maybe more) I take back my mac and it didn&#x27;t started without power supply (in the meanwhile nobody used it). Tried to take in charge it for several hours, but not changed, the battery was KO. 
 In add to this, few weeks ago I installed Fedora on my macbook, because MacOS was really slow. The OS works flawlessly, but of course nothing changed regarding the battery (need the power supply to turn on). 
 Last week I bought a non-original battery (a good one, considering the price - I hope :D) but what happens now is that my macbook still do not turn on without power supply, but immediately after the apple logo come up, I can pull off the charger and the macbook go on with its own battery. The strange things: 
 - Fedora do not recognize the battery (tried by terminal), also if in that moment it&#x27;s working with that 
 - The mac wants the power supply just to turn on (with just the battery it doesn&#x27;t start). 
 Already tried few SMC reset but nothing changed. Also tried another battery, but got the same result. 
 What it could be? Do you have any recommendations? 
 Thank you in advance.

                              <span>Background: It&#x27;s a super old Sony viao laptop which my mom treasures a lot and wants to keep functional. I know a little here and there about computers and know old tech (excluding exceptions) isn&#x27;t worth much and is mostly discarded. Since it was super slow on windows 7 , I decided to run xubuntu on it which was the lightest Os I could find. 
 Question? For the above specs , is there any Linux os that could run smoothly on this laptop ? My mom wants it for web surfing. Xubuntu runs but playing YouTube videos is a no go. Is it even possible for this system to run youtube and browse web without too much trouble . I am all ears . Open to suggestions

                              <span>I was actively using the app on my phone and it suddenly crashed at 4:10pm PDT. I thought it was just my phone acting up but then I realized that’s about 12am UTC.  With the death of Apollo also goes the metaphorical death of all the best parts (IMO) of the internet: open-source, creativity, entrepreneurial spirit. Sad day. I guess I’ll go outside now.
Edit: sorry, Apollo wasn’t open source. That’s what happens when I make a post while two beers deep I guess. Hopefully you get the general spirit of what I was trying to convey.

from Jiří Benc&#x27;s DevConf.cz talk on the making of the CentOS Stream
kernel.


	So, what the team are working on is a Frankenstein&#x27;s monster, sewn
	together from different codebases. Although the base kernel is
	still version 5.14, it is full of backports from upstream. It has
	the XFS filesystem code from kernel 6.0, the USB subsystem –
	complete with drivers – and BPF subsystem from kernel 6.2, the
	wireless stack and all drivers from kernel 6.3, and the multipath
	TCP/IP code from kernel 6.4 – which at the time of the talk hadn&#x27;t
	even been released upstream yet.</span>

                              <span>Linus 的放松方式是写内联汇编

Linus Torvalds 在改进一个性能优化补丁后说，“有些人通过在泳池边喝杯好酒来放松，我通过玩内联汇编来放松”。这个补丁是为正在进行的 Linux 6.5 合并窗口提出的，它大幅提升了吞吐量，并降低了用于校验的 csum_partial 函数调用的延迟。在某些情况下，可能会有 8~9% 的延迟改善，以及大约 30% 的吞吐量改善。另外一个内核工程师调侃道，“还有第三种人，他们在游泳池边喝着好酒，同时玩着内联汇编”。

老王点评：好吧，真是独特的放松方式。我的放松方式之一就是写写代码，前提是这些代码不让我暴跳如雷。😉




Rocky Linux 反对红帽的决定，并找出了合法获得 RHEL 源代码的方法

在红帽公司决定 限制 对 RHEL 源代码的访问后，并通过服务条款（TOS）和最终用户许可协议（EULA）施加了一些条件，试图阻碍合法客户行使 GPL 所保证的权利。Rocky Linux 认为“这种协议违反了开源的精神和目的”，并已经找出了其它获得 RHEL 源代码的方法：一个选择是通过使用 UBI 容器镜像，它是基于 RHEL 的，可以从多个在线来源获得；另一个方法是通过按使用量付费的公共云实例，从而获得所有软件包和勘误表的源代码，并且可以通过 CI 管道自动完成所有这些工作。Rocky Linux 强调，“这些方法之所以可能是因为 GPL 的力量。没有人可以阻止 GPL 软件的再分发。重申一下，这两种方法使我们能够合法地获得 RHEL 二进制文件和源码包，而不影响我们对开源软件的承诺，也不会受到妨碍我们权利的 TOS 或 EULA 限制。”


消息来源：Phoronix



老王点评：我觉得这件事上红帽是自取其辱。一方面用着 GPL 软件赚钱，另外一方面又试图无视 GPL 许可证赋予的权利。没错，红帽是“没有义务让重新构建者的工作更加容易”，但是从根本上它不能违反 GPL 协议而限制源代码的可得性。最终结果是，RHEL 下游发行版依然存在，红帽却显得吃相难看。




微软公开预览 Windows 11 Copilot

几个月前，微软在 Edge 和必应支持的任务栏搜索栏中加入了生成性人工智能。本周，微软在 Windows Insider 中为公共测试者提供了 Copilot 预览。用户可以按快捷键在屏幕右侧打开 Copilot 栏。除了聊天功能，Copilot 还将支持使用 OpenAI 的 DALL-E 2 模型创建图像。此外，Copilot 还将在一开始就推出必应广告，微软将为你提供该公司 “认为相关” 的广告。

老王点评：说实话我觉得现在的 AI 和操作系统的结合还属于生搬硬套，什么时候操作系统不需要人类“操作”了，才真正的变成了 AI 的“系统”。</span>

                              <span>在这份超详细的指南中了解如何通过 i3 窗口管理器来自定义系统的外观和体验。


你可能在网上（尤其是通过 r/unixporn 子区）看到过很多炫酷的截图，用户可以根据个人喜好自定义他们的桌面并与大家分享。

这是因为 Linux 允许你自定义桌面体验的方方面面。

而结果？就是比任何 Mac 或 Windows 系统更具视觉和感知效果。

来看一下这个 😌



看起来像一个 Linux Mint 系统吗？ 😲

但是你怎样才能做到这样呢？自定义你的 Linux 桌面外观是很困难的。

答案就在于 窗口管理器。如果你能配置好窗口管理器，你就能自定义外观。

在本指南中，我将引导你完成使用 i3 窗口管理器 进行基本配置。它是 Linux 上最好的窗口管理器之一。


💡 “加料Rice” 是一个常用的词汇，用来指代在桌面上进行视觉改进和自定义。引用自 /r/unixporn （LCTT 译注：“加料”一词来自于购买便宜的亚洲汽车，并给它们安装售后零件，以让它更好地类似于赛车。）


在遵循本指南之前，你需要了解以下内容：


在本指南中，我将使用 Arch Linux 来演示步骤，但你可以使用你喜欢的任何发行版，结果也是一样的。

请记住，本指南是 对 i3 进行“加料”定制的基础。


在按照本指南进行操作后，你应该得到以下预期结果：

                              <span>香港本来只有一所颇具规模的大学，就是以英语教学的香港大学。1963年，中文教学的崇基学院、新亚书院和联合书院合并为“中文大学”。今年香港中文大学的六十周年校庆举办了一系列活动，我应中文系张健教授之邀于4月14日做了一次报告，谈“华人学者对北美汉学的贡献”。
这里“汉学”泛指海外的中国研究（虽说这名词在西方算过时了，学者大多会划定自己研究中国哪一领域）；“北美”则指美国和土地辽阔、人口却只有其十分之一、同属一个学术圈的加拿大。疫情期间香港中文大学曾办了个线上讲座，邀请在斯坦福教中国文学的艾朗诺与当了逾半世纪汉学“票友”的我谈“美国汉学五十年”。我们主要讲朗诺在加州大学、华盛顿大学及哈佛的老师们。我有感于有些人错以为“汉学家”都是白人，而一般“海外汉学”的讨论也有意无意地绕过华人，因此这一趟聚焦于华人学者，谈他们的背景，在汉学界的地位与所扮演的角色，最后略述我对汉学前景的一些看法。
其实北美汉学比欧洲起步晚却后来居上，华人学者的参与非常关键；尤其在文学领域内，近年来可说已取得压倒性的地位。北美汉学界华人多，有下列几个原因：
1）二十世纪初义和团运动，美国获得“庚子赔款”的百分之七点三二，比实际损失的要多些，就决定把多余的款项用以资助中国学生留美，培养了一批中英文俱佳的学人。这一千数百名留美学生大多攻读理工，回国后在各大学、政府机关或私人企业工作，也有一小部分在美国执教。
2）美国铝业公司创办人霍尔（Charles Martin Hall）没有子嗣，遗嘱把财产三分之一留给“英美人士在亚洲或巴尔干半岛办教育的机构”。为争取这笔巨款，当时在北平的燕京大学和美国麻州哈佛大学决定合办“哈佛燕京学社”，于1928年成立。当时北美开设与中国有关的课程寥寥无几，该社资助美国各大学有意从事中国学术研究的学生访华，也资助年轻燕京学人访学哈佛；同时在哈佛设立“哈佛燕京图书馆”和出版《哈佛亚洲研究学报…</span>

 I think we can all understand the intent of specifically choosing a donkey&#x27;s butt.
 This breaks no rules, keeps the sub open, and is not horrifying enough for them to shut down while still getting our message across that a certain someone is being a stubborn little boy

                              <span>vDSO is a shared library that the kernel maps into the memory address space of every user-mode application. It is not something that developers need to think about due to the fact it is used by the C library (https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/vdso.7.html).
 Overall, the reason for even having vDSO is the fact they are specific system calls that are used frequently by user-mode applications.Due to the time/cost of the context-switching between user-mode and kernel-mode in order to execute a syscall it might impact the overall performance of an application. 
 Thus, vDSO provides “virtual syscalls” due to the need for optimizing system calls implementations. The solution needed to not require libc to track CPU capabilities and or the kernel version. Let us take for example x86, which has …</span>

                              <span>I know this question is probably seen alot here, but I&#x27;m a Linux beginner, I know a little about it and have dabled in it a little bit but not much other then a few basic commands.
 I feel like Linux Mint is a bit too basic for me and for what I would like to do. I am interested in learning the Linux terminal to possibly learn a bit of network type stuff.
 I have tried Kali but it is debated wether or not it is recommended due to learning how to installl the apps Kali gives you is advised rather then using Kali as a package if you&#x27;re interested in the cyber security stuff which is one of my main interests. I have tried Ubuntu but that also seems to not be reccomended anymore. Linux Mint looks very basic and I feel like I wouldnt be able to do everything I want in it.
 Bare in mind I would like to daily drive Linux eventually, and due to ease of use I&#x27;d like it to be a Debian based distro.
 UPDATE I didnt write the post very well, Im not dissing mint at all, I just dont think its my kind of OS and I&#x27;d like something that skews a bit more away from the windows side of things.

                              <span>I&#x27;m working towards getting my power draw as optimized and efficient as possible and am curious how low you have gotten your average power draw.
 I&#x27;ve gotten my average draw down to ~8W. On my 65Wh battery this equates to about 8hrs of battery life under light use.
 x86_64 systems only please
 ​
 My setup and tweaks:
 - Arch Linux (also obtained on Mint)
 - Razer Blade 15 (2021 Base)
 - dGPU powered off
 - auto-cpufreq for power optimizations
 ​
 I&#x27;d like to get it down to ~5W, but idk if that&#x27;s feasible. The 7-8W breakpoint appears quite difficult to pass.

                              <span>Hello. I want to ask about a specific scenario:
 Lets say I got a flash drive, I wrote 10 files there, deleted 2 of them, so 8 are present at the moment. We know files don&#x27;t just get deleted, it&#x27;s just that the OS forgets that they&#x27;re there and you can always retrieve deleted files unless they&#x27;re damaged (overwritten).
 My question is, how would I be able to copy all 10 files including 8 present ones and 2 deleted ones from that flash drive to another so that I would be able to recover those 2 deleted ones on the second flash drive?
 My best guess is &quot;rsync -vuar /source/directory /destination/directory&quot; but I don&#x27;t know if it would be able to copy the deleted ones too. Please tell if that would work and if not, which command should I use instead?

 Dear community,
 I&#x27;m Piotr from Customrombay.org, and I would like to bring some exciting news for all Linux enthusiasts.
 Today, support for displaying information about Linux distributions on phones was added to Customrombay.org. Now, you can easily compare the availability of custom Android ROMs, custom recoveries, and Linux distributions between devices.
 What is Customrombay?
 Customrombay is the largest database of custom ROMs, with support for over 550 devices. Our goal is to support as many custom ROMs and devices as possible and provide quality information about them.
 Contributing
 Contributing to Customrombay is highly encouraged, as it helps the project grow. More information is available on the contributing page.
 Open source
 Customrombay.org is completely open source. You can find us on GitHub. Our code is licensed under the MPL-2.0 license.
 Phones with notable Linux support
 For now, only information about Ubuntu Touch support is available on our website. We plan to extend that to PostmarketOS and NixOS. But which devices does Ubuntu Touch support? For example those:
  
OnePlus 6 (enchilada)
 OnePlus 6T (fajita)
 OnePlus One (bacon)
 Xiaomi Poco F1 (beryllium)
 Xiaomi POCO X3 (surya)
 Sony Xperia X (suzu)
 Google Pixel 3a (sargo)
 ASUS Zenfone Max Pro M1 (X00TD)

 Some time ago I changed that the processor is running while the lid is closed. This is not longer necessary and so I wanted to revert the settings. But when informing myself how to do that, more questions popped up. 
 1) Secure Boot. In order to activate the Hibernate settings, I have to disable Secure Boot. I don&#x27;t really feel comfortable doing this, because I have read conflicting opinions on this. On one hand I read that it&#x27;s good and recommended for security issues and on the hand I read it&#x27;s just a propaganda term coined by Microsoft. I have no idea whom I should believe…</span>

                              <span>Hey all!
 I have brought a new windows laptop recently and I am trying to dual boot it with Linux. Although it successfully puts the system in the partitioned disk, whenever I choose the option of booting Linux, it boots the system and after a few seconds, it goes back to the boot option screen. I have even tried the safe graphics mode and still the same result. I have no idea what&#x27;s going on. Can somebody please help.

                              <span>RedHat has &quot;sunset&quot; the RHEL 8 Exam and since June 2023 one can take only RHEL 9 Exam. I did the exam last year, but I failed. Last week I picked it up again and started learning (about 42 hours of learn time until now). Yesterday I found out that the RHEL 8 Exam was discontinued and I felt dumb for wasting time restudying the old material. Long story short, are the major and/or critical differences between RHEL 8 and RHEL 9 learning material?

                              <span>Hi Folks, 
 I think come from a very uncommon background. I&#x27;m an Econ Undergrad that recently got interested in understanding how Linux kernel works. Could someome tell me from where should I start studying? Maybe give me some sort of roadmap. 
 For context, I have some good experience with coding (as a hobby, 3+ years), but mostly python and webdev stuff. I have been studying C and C++, Data Structures and Algos, and I have very basic understanding of Memory, CPU, etc. 
 My goal is to understand how kernel optimizations are made in High Frequency Trading firms.
 ​
 thanks!

                              <span>The Emacs editor is not tied to the Linux kernel; indeed, it was created
some years before Linux existed.  The Emacs code base is intended to be
portable, and the editor runs, with varying levels of support, on a wide
variety of systems.  Recently, an energetic developer has worked to extend
the set of supported systems to Android; the result is a working port, but
whether that port will be accepted into the Emacs mainline is the topic of
ongoing conversation.</span>

ReactOS 是一个开源的操作系统，旨在复制微软的 Windows，可以不加修改地运行许多 Windows 应用程序。ReactOS 的上一次更新是在 2021 年 12 月。此前它的发布计划是每三个月释出一个新版本，但自从 0.4.14 之后就再无动静。面对用户的疑问，该项目发文称其还活着，只是之后的版本发布会根据质量而不是数量。新的发布规则是“一个新版本要达到 &#x60;发布’ 状态，需要有合理的低回归量（不超过 20个）”。但他们并没有给出下一个版本预计发布的时间，不过你可以随时尝试其每夜构建版本。


消息来源：ReactOS



老王点评：其实，没事发个新版本表示活着，至少是给社区一些信心的做法。




WhatsApp 关闭了基于 Electron 的桌面应用

当 WhatsApp 处于早期开发阶段时，开发者创建了一个基于 Electron JavaScript 框架的桌面应用程序，它在 Windows 和 macOS 上都能使用。大约四周前，这个桌面应用程序的主屏幕上出现了一个倒计时器，宣布其即将关闭。WhatsApp 让用户切换到其原生应用程序上，新的原生应用程序已经稳定运行了一年左右。

老王点评：有了原生应用，谁还用 Electron 的呀。




GitHub DDoS 攻击了一个重要的开源项目小网站

一个 GCC 核心的开源算术库 GMP 项目所使用的服务器遭受到了大量的来自 GitHub 的 IP 的连接。无奈之下，该项目只能封禁了数百个微软的 IP 地址。微软发现这是一个被复刻了 700 多次的存储库上的 Actions 工作流导致的。一位 GitHub 用户更新了 FFmpeg-Builds 项目中的一个脚本，该脚本从 gmplib.org 提取内容。这种活动应该不是恶意的，但 GMP 有限的基础设施无法应对这个量级的并发请求。这并不是第一次有软件项目因为繁重的流量需求而喊出被 DDoS。


消息来源：The Register



老王点评：这个事情里面没有主动的恶意行为者，但是 GitHub 这么大体量，稍有不慎对其它微小的基础设施都是毁灭性打击，所以，微软应该对其基础设施和应用更加慎重一些。</span>

                              <span>一款出色的 Flatpak 应用，可从 Linux 桌面访问 WhatsApp。


WhatsApp 是流行的手机通讯平台，在许多国家都很受欢迎。用户通常通过 Play 商店或 App Store 中的移动应用访问它。然而，WhatsApp 从未推出任何适用于 Linux 的官方桌面客户端。

尽管你可以使用浏览器访问 WhatsApp，这是从任何桌面（包括 Linux）访问消息的官方方式。

一个新的非官方 WhatsApp Flatpak 桌面应用出现了，你可以无缝地使用它进行通信。

那么，这个 GTK 应用有哪些功能？

“Linux 版 WhatsApp” 的功能



借助这款新的桌面应用，Linux 桌面用户可以在他们最喜欢的桌面环境中享受 WhatsApp 的所有熟悉功能。现在，你可以在 Linux 发行版上轻松访问所有功能，例如发送消息、共享媒体文件以及进行语音和视频通话。

“Linux 版 WhatsApp” 应用还提供键盘快捷键，确保应用内的无缝导航和交互。使用此应用，你可以放大和缩小以仔细查看图像和文本，或切换到全屏模式以获得无干扰的聊天体验。该应用还包括一个系统托盘图标，即使在应用最小化时也可以快速访问和通知。

此外，你可以自定义应用以满足你的喜好。通过按 Alt+H，你可以轻松显示或隐藏标题栏，从而更好地控制工作区。该应用还支持系统语言的本地化，确保你可以轻松地与世界各地的朋友和家人进行交流。



Linux 版 WhatsApp 应用的一项值得注意的功能是支持系统语言的拼写检查。要启用此功能，你必须安装相应的词典，例如美国英语的 hunspell-en_us 包。

技术细节

如果你想知道，它不是一个 Electron 应用。它是使用原生 C++ 编写的，确保了最佳的性能和安全性。它依赖于各种免费和开源库，例如 intltool、gtkmm-3.0、webkit2gtk-4.0、ayatana-appindicator3-0.1、libcanberra 以及用于拼写检查的 libhunspell（可选）。

你可以从 GitHub 上的源码了解有关此应用的更多信息。

安装

首先，你必须为你的 Linux 发行版设置 Flatpak 和 Flathub。使用 本指南 来设置。

安装后，运行以下命令进行安装。

flatpak install com.github.eneshecan.WhatsAppForLinux


你可以在应用列表中找到该应用。

运行应用

打开应用后，设置与 WhatsApp 网页类似。打开手机的 WhatsApp 应用并扫描应用中的二维码。这样就完成了。



请注意，这是一个非官方的应用。因此，请谨慎使用。你还可以查看 GitHub 以获取有关此应用的更多详细信息。

                              <span>近日，全国多家高校发布公告称，7月1日起开始暂停使用微信支付，原因是微信支付将收取0.6%的手续费，而此前，微信支付对教育场景下的支付服务一直免收服务费。


据不完全统计，目前已有西北大学、南京理工大学、江苏师范大学等多所高校均发布了类似的停用微信支付公告。


6月27日，西北大学发布的公告称，“因腾讯公司微信支付将于 7 月 1 日起对校园场景用户进行精细化管理，除收学费外，其它收费均会受到限制并收取 0.6% 的手续费，决定对校内一卡通用户暂停提供微信扫码支付服务。”


周口师范学院也表示，接到财付通支付科技有限公司通知后，学校多方沟通并未收到明显效果，为减轻不必要的财政负担，决定自6月29日起停用校内微信支付场景应用，包括财务处收取的各类费用、校园一卡通充值、教材费缴纳、教职员工生活区网络交通费、学生宿舍空调电费、商业用房电费缴费等。


针对此事，微信团队表示，由于我们对高校生活服务场景支付费率问题处理不周，造成大家的困扰，在此向广大学校及师生致歉。请大家放心，在校园非盈利场景，我们会持续保持零费率优惠政策。


此次调整的本意是为了对费率实施更加精细化的优惠措施，但很显然过于简单粗暴引起误解，我们深表歉意，即刻修正，后续我们将继续优化与高校的沟通流程，加强合作，助力校园数字化的持续发展。


此外，据记者了解，针对教育场景，云闪付、支付宝、银行等渠道等尚未出现支付费用上涨的问题，仍可正常使用。


博通咨询金融分析师王蓬博对记者表示，校园场景总体来看一直是被当做公益类场景，监管也一直延续对这类场景的支付费率优惠政策，并且从2021年开始也一直号召对中小微企业和公益类场景减费让利。


他表示，由于商业发展和政策等多方面原因，账户侧数字钱包分润模式种类多样，此前对于一般类场景才能够达到0.6%的手续费费率，对于公益类场景一直是0费率，此次微信支付对校园场景提价，说明微信本身依靠金融科技版块盈利的压力较大。因此，建议微信支付自身做好社会责任和盈利之间的平衡，目前微信可以依靠高粘性获取用户，但年轻用户群体的使用习惯也有可能改变。


记者注意到，中国银行卡收单市场的费率一直处于较低水平，导致收单机构的利润率较低，受到近年来严监管的持续，支付收单机构的合规成本也在逐渐增加，也让银行卡收单机构们在“跳码”事件后，开始提高特定场景的收单费率。


此外，腾讯最新发布的财报显示，腾讯金融科技板块增长较为乏力，2022年，腾讯金融科技及企业服务业务年度的收入同比仅增长3%，至1771亿元。

九十年前，苏联微生物学家格奥尔基·高斯将零点五克燕麦片放入一百毫升水中，煮十分钟，制成培养基后进行过滤，再加水稀释一同倒入平底试管里，最后将五只草履虫放进试管。一周之中，他观察到草履虫数量在缓慢增长一段时间后开始快速疯狂繁殖，到了第三天，数量达到顶点。然而，随着食物逐渐耗尽，种群数量开始下降直到趋于零。这一年高斯二十四岁，他用不起眼的草履虫发现了至今令人类思索的一条规律：生物会在疯狂生长到充满整个培养皿，以致拥挤到触碰器皿边缘后，开始自我消耗，直至殆尽。
那么，人类是否也与草履虫一样？我们是否已触碰到人类这个物种繁殖量的边缘？如果是，未来应该怎么办？
这精彩的故事和发人深思的追问来自美国作家查尔斯·C. 曼恩的新著《巫师与先知：两种环保科学观如何帮助人类应对生态危机》。作者发挥其科学记者的优势，采访大量专家与学者的同时，还收集了相关领域丰富的科学数据，再结合实际走访，与全世界各地环保主义者、政治家、农业人员和官员面谈，写出了一本难能可贵的环境保护论战史。全书以立场截然不同但又都关心人类前途命运的两位代表人物为线索，通过详细讲述他们的生平与贡献，串联起当今世界环保主义与科学主义人士百年来的探索与困惑。作者将他们归纳为先知派和巫师派。
环保主义与科学主义
先知派的代表威廉·沃格特在我国的知名度一定比不上《寂静的春天》的作者蕾切尔·卡森。但卡森的名著却是受到沃格特《生存之路》一书启发而写就的，尽管两人年龄仅相差五岁。沃格特出生于1902年，是现代环境保护运动基本理念的制定者。他倡导“世界末日环境论”，认为不断增长的人口数量以及不会降低的消费水平最终将压垮地球的生态系统。富裕不是成就，而是不断付出代价的向地球的索取。消减！消减！是他…</span>

                              <span>《论文化》，[英] 特里·伊格尔顿著，张舒语译，中信出版社/新思文化，2018年11月版，180页，32.00元

英国著名学者、马克思主义文化批评家特里·伊格尔顿（Terry Eagleton）的《论文化》（原书名Culture，2016）虽然只是一部不到十万字的小书，但其研究议题的深度、论述视角之开阔、批判性观点的尖锐与深刻都使其具有厚重之感。看起来是宏大抽象的主题和自由随意的思想散论，实际上在观念分析、历史语境中的意涵溯源和现实政治中的思想剖析等方面均表现出对复杂性和争议性议题的深刻思辨功力，在论述中对尼采、弗洛伊德、马克思、伯克、赫尔德、维特根斯坦、T. S. 艾略特和王尔德等人的观点的精准讨论也使该书具有以“文化”观念为中心的思想史色彩。而伊格尔顿的流畅、恣肆不羁的文风也使阅读带有了另类快感。对我来说，由于同时在阅读弗里茨·斯特恩（Fritz Richard Oskar Stern）的《非自由主义的失败：论现代德国政治文化》（孟钟捷译，商务印书馆，2015年5月），正在思考的是著名的近现代史难题“德国问题”中文化与政治的复杂关系、权力与文化之争、文明与文化之争、从文化政治走向政治文化的路径等议题，因此对伊格尔顿的《论文化》更多关注的是其中文化与政治的论述。在当下的思想与学术场域中，无论我们对伊格尔顿的理论体系及具体论点有何不同看法，他的鲜活与敏锐的批判性气质仍然是很有感染力的。
作者在“序言”中讲了本书的论述方法：鉴于“文化”这个概念的多层次使其很难被高度统一地展开描述，因此他采取的是围绕“文化”这个主题的多侧面论述。从全书内容议题来说，该书第一章首先讨论了“文化”与“文明”在概念、内涵和使用语境等方面的联系与区别。这一部分在我看来非常适合作为文明史与文化史导论课程的开篇语，可以启发学生从一开始就以开阔的观念与语言学视野思考历史叙事体系的建构与核心概念的复杂联系。…</span>

                              <span>So I let me start like this.
 I had an old Lenovo Notebook lay around and I thought about making a bit of use out of it. I wanted to explore new teritories and well make something practical. 
 I&#x27;m an old windows veteran (since 3.11) and also early Android (with alt OSs like Cynogen/Lineage) user so i&#x27;m not completley new to change of OS and I&#x27;m used to tinker around. Also some old Suse and Knoppix as live CD but that&#x27;s a whole different thing.
 What I want to do is:
 - hook the notebook up to the network
 - let a linux distrubtion be the OS
 - run Jellyfin/Kodi or an alternativ to hook up my quite big digital CD collection into a streaming setup to use it as spotify alternativ 
 So I installed Fedora Server, got PTSD Flashbacks to MS-DOS and said hell no I need an GUI. SO I installed Fedora Workstation.
 Rat Head enters the chat, does what we all know.
 He is the point, I don&#x27;t want to go away from Microsoft to then Popo love without lubricants by Red Hat.
 I thought about using Mint, I like the Cinamon GUI they use. (I know I could theoretical tinker cinamon onto fedora even I don&#x27;t know yet how). 
 But I&#x27;m not sure how good Mint is for what I want to use it. So.. help. please.
 Thank you for your pation with a beginner.

                              <span>Hi,
 today i talk with a friend and we are discussing about the pros and cons of the use of Linux Mint vs Windows.
 He tell me that for him it&#x27;s not possible to switch to linux, in particular to Mint because is a simple hobby made from some unknow people... and he describe it as a : Hobbyware...
 He concluded with... yo uare doing banking and other sensible work with this OS? I tell... yes!
 And he tell me that i&#x27;m mad, and that windows is not very secure, but i&#x27;m doing very bad use of my pc because linux mint is not secure (he repeat... it&#x27;s only an hobby from someone into a garage...)
 You opinion about that?
 Yes in the last three month i&#x27;m using linux mint and every day i use it more and more... and i&#x27;m very happy.
 I know behind mint there is not a corporate or a company, and this for some people is wrong, some prefer microsoft and apple because the give the feel of &quot;business&quot; &#x3D; &quot;reliable&quot;.
 But it&#x27;s so bad use a distro like mint for every day pc use?

                              <span>I was building Guix from source recently and because a big part of which was waiting till compiling of its dependencies and Guix itself ends. So i thought is there any way to KDE connect to notify that command ended and you can continue working on computer and come back to it (I mean physically go to your desk )? 
 Maybe I am mistaken and there is already feature like that but last time i checked there is no such feature.

                              <span>I have questions on the security of the flatpak apps or packages, compared to the native Linux distribution versions. 
 How long usually the updates are delayed, from when an application update becomes available in a linux distribution?
 How trusted are the package maintainers in either case? Like, for the distribution packages, there are probably reviews of shipped software to some extent. Flathub can be like Pypy, with many malicious submissions nobody checks. Any random person could upload a package!

                              <span>Hey iam a bloody beginner, but interested in the concept of linux. I installed the ubuntu server on a usb stick to clear the ssd of a friend and to save his data. I know that stuff like this can be done with any distro, but ubuntu seemed a bit heavy for the simple stuff, which I have used it for. Iam looking for a beginner friendly lightweight distro, which has good community support. It would be nice if it has a clean UI (Iam not a big fan of the look of puppy linux). 
 Additionally Iam looking for a distro that only has a console, like the ubuntu server, but more leightweight. 
 Do you have any reccomendations for the two distros iam looking for?

                              <span>First, you/the users still get the software. It may not be as easy to compile to a 1:1 copy, but it never was perfectly easy. Red Hat never offered binary packages outside their own RHEL distribution channels.
 RHEL&#x27;s unique value proposition is being well tested, stable, and standards compliant, with bug fixes delivered ASAP. Red Hat invests lots of money, time, effort to deliver this in RHEL, whereas the RHEL clones don&#x27;t offer added value beyond being cheaper. I find it hard to argue: 1) any user has a right to a continuous stream of updates, especially where 2) that user is seeking to wipe away any return on Red Hat&#x27;s investment.
 Second, Red Hat is a business, and we need to stop pretending every FOSS business should be some quasi-public trust. Red Hat should do what&#x27;s good for Red Ha…</span>

Lately I’ve been playing around on Linux virtual machines (specifically Ubuntu Studio) and I’m seriously thinking of migrating my Asus Zenbook with a. RTX 3080gpu and 32gb of ram over fully to Linux. 
 My main uses for this computer are creating and programming, both which Linux seems to excel at more than windows plus I love the ease of use of Linux. Is there a reason not to switch to Linux? Would I be wasting my hardware? Thanks

                              <span>Is this the normal behavior?
 
Is it ok to leave Secure Boot disabled? I‘m using only Debian on the Laptop. 
 
Should I reinstall Debian with Secure Boot on?
 
 Thanks!

                              <span>The GPL-3 itself allows you to include additional terms according to Section 7:
  
“Additional permissions” are terms that supplement the terms of this License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions. Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall be treated as though they were included in this License...
  
So as long as the additional terms do not conflict with GPL-3, you may add your own terms. In fact, LGPL works like this. LGPL-3 is essentially word-per-word GPL-3 + additional terms which is an exercise of Section 7 of the GPL-3.
 Section 7 makes GPL-3 a modular, base license for other people to adapt with their own terms as long as it is compatible with GPL.
 You will still call your license GPL-3. The additional terms will be placed in a separate file:
  
If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you must place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the additional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating where to find the applicable terms.
  
I can imagine an additional term to combat Red Hat&#x27;s style paywall to go something like this:
 This program should not be subjected to an agreement that penalizes the licensee from exercising their rights under this license.

                              <span>Hi. Hopefully my post doesn&#x27;t get removed again. Is there any program that I can use to have automagical error correction in piped data. Basically what I want is this:

                              <span>It all started on my birthday, when my mother gave me a low-end notebook for studying. At first I thought it was unnecessary because I already have a high-end computer, but this innocent wrong gift literally changed my life.
 For being low-end, Windows 10 was running very poorly, and I decided to install Ubuntu just for testing, and man... how freakin awesome Linux is! At first it&#x27;s kinda hard because you don&#x27;t even know cd or apt , but the more you try stuff, the more you learn how to do things efficiently, and even more important, you learn how to actually solve problems by yourself.
 Yesterday I changed GNOME for KDE, and holy ****, it&#x27;s a new world of customization, and I just can&#x27;t get enough of this feeling of exploring a whole new land. Even when I get frustrated after failing multiple times trying to do something, the thirst for overcoming challenges seems endless!
 I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;m being crazy for thinking that exploring an OS is thrilling, but I just feel like an 7 years old kid learning how to do things on a computer for the first time, but in a very depth/technical way (at least in my head lol).
 After this awesome experience, I finally decided to go for a computing college, and I just can&#x27;t thank my mother enough for giving me a shi*** computer lol. I don&#x27;t know a single person who uses Linux, so I figured I might be better understood here
 tl;dr Linux just set my life course

 Is there any way to prevent it being written to at all?
 Specifically this:

 I have it set up how I love it, but every now and then it reverts back to how I hate it.

如果你想的话，Linux 终端可以是一个有趣的地方。

当然，终端一般用在严肃的场合，但你可以使用 有趣的 Linux 命令 来娱乐自己。

cowsay 就是其中之一。它可以在终端上显示一头牛。



cowsay 的一个特点是，如果与其他命令组合使用，它可以用于一些 “严肃的场合”。比如，在共享的 Linux 服务器上使用它来显示 “每日消息”，以供多个用户查看。

听起来有趣吗？是时候喂养安装一个了。

安装 Cowsay

cowsay 是一个受欢迎的工具，它可以在大多数 Linux 发行版的软件仓库中找到。

要在 Debian 和 Ubuntu 系统上安装 cowsay，请打开终端并运行：

sudo apt install cowsay


对于 Fedora，请使用：

sudo dnf install cowsay


在基于 Arch Linux 的发行版中，请使用：

sudo pacman -S cowsay


使用 Cowsay

顾名思义，这是一头以 ASCII 艺术展示的牛，能输出输入的文本。默认情况下，cowsay 提供了几个选项来调整这头 ASCII 牛的外观和样式。

普通的 cowsay

cowsay 


这将在牛讲话的气泡中打印你提供的任何文本。



或者，你可以使用管道重定向，将另一个命令（比如 echo）的输出作为 cowsay 的输入。

echo &quot;Hello&quot; | cowsay


贪婪的牛

这里，牛的眼睛看起来有点贪婪，它是美元符号。

cowsay -g 




使用特殊字符作为眼睛

                              <span>红帽认为 RHEL 克隆品是对开源公司的“真正威胁”

前两天，红帽 宣布 其企业发行版 RHEL 的源代码将只公开发布在 CentOS Stream 上，其直接后果是社区将无法直接获得 RHEL 的精确源代码。这显然给 1:1 复制 RHEL 的下游发行版，如 AlmaLinux、Rocky Linux 等造成了 阻碍。面对社区批评，红帽高管最近撰文反驳，指出对他们愤怒的人“要么来自于那些不愿为生产 RHEL 需要付出的时间、精力和资源付费的人，要么来自那些因为自己的利益而想要重新打包它的人”。他认为 AlmaLinux 等“下游重新构建者没有价值”，“简单地重新打包，并进行原样转售，没有增加任何的价值，还让开源软件的生产变得不可持续”，并且表示，他们“没有义务让重新构建者的工作更加容易”。更严重的是，他还指控这是一种对开源的“威胁”，“如果是仅仅重新构建代码，而不对现有代码增加价值或进行任何修改，对于所有开源公司来说，这才是真正的威胁。这对开源来说是一个真正的威胁，有可能将开源重新变回到只适用于业余爱好者和黑客的活动。”


消息来源：红帽



老王点评：一方面受限于 GPL 而不得不公开源代码，另外一方面又千方百计提高获得源代码的麻烦程度，并反过来指责那些依据 GPL 而获得源代码的人是“威胁” —— 说实话，“威胁”这个词我记得当年微软也这样说过。曾经红帽砍掉 CentOS 项目，而用滚动变化的 CentOS Stream 替代时，我认为这对 RHEL 的发展是有益的，面对很多“误解”，也曾出面帮他们做过一些澄清。但是现在红帽终于图穷匕见，认为从 RHEL 源代码构建的“克隆品”是一个“威胁”。我想说，你利用开源代码构建的 RHEL，没有资格说同样根据许可证获得源代码构建发行版的人是“威胁”！另外，卫 Sir 今天的 撰文 对此做了更深入的剖析，值得一看。




微软考虑将 Windows 转移到云端

在 FTC 诉微软收购动视暴雪听证会上，一份被公开的微软 2022 年 6 月的内部演示文稿中，微软讨论了在 Windows 365 的基础上实现从云端到任何设备的完整 Windows 操作系统串流。Windows 365 是一项将完整版本的 Windows 串流到设备的服务，目前仅提供给商业客户，但微软已经将其深度整合到 Windows 11 中。未来的更新将包括 Windows 365 Boot，它将使 Windows 11 设备在启动时直接登录到云 PC 实例，而不是本地版本的 Windows。

手机跟踪软件 LetMeSpy 称其被黑客窃取了大量信息

LetMeSpy 是一款手机监控应用程序，被用于家长控制或员工监控。这类手机监控应用程序也被称为跟踪软件或配偶软件，通常在未经本人同意或不知情的情况下对某人的手机进行物理访问而植入。一旦被植入，LetMeSpy 就会默默地将手机的短信、通话记录和精确的位置数据上传到其服务器，让植入该应用程序的人能够实时跟踪该人。该公司称，一名黑客窃取了 LetMeSpy 从电子邮件、电话号码和账户上截获的信息。入侵的黑客表示已经夺取了该公司域名的广泛访问权，并暗示他们删除了 LetMeSpy 存储在服务器上的数据库。同一天晚些时候，一份被黑的数据库的副本也出现在网上。

                              <span>本快速教程解释了安装和使用 GNOME Boxes 以及创建虚拟机的步骤，以及一些提示和故障排除。


虚拟化是使用抽象硬件层运行虚拟实例（而不是实际实例）的过程。通俗地说，它允许你同时安装和运行多个操作系统（Linux、Windows）。

虚拟机 是一个模拟操作系统，它运行在另一个操作系统之上，并使用与主机相同的硬件和存储空间。虽然，你可以控制可以分配给虚拟机的共享内存或空间量。

有多种软件可用于创建虚拟机，例如 Virtual Box、KVM、Hyper-V、VMWare player 和 GNOME Boxes。

但老实说，它们中的大多数使用起来都很复杂，有时还不够稳定。GNOME Boxes 是另一个自由开源的软件，它非常易于使用，通过抽象出大量选项让你可以轻松创建和管理虚拟机。

安装 GNOME Boxes

如果你正在运行 Fedora 的 GNOME 定制版，你应该已经安装了它。但是，对于 Ubuntu、Linux Mint、Kubuntu 和其他发行版，你只需运行以下命令即可将其安装到你的系统中。

sudo apt install gnome-boxes


通过 Flatpak

它也可以通过 Flatpak 包获得。我会推荐你使用这个版本。首先，使用 本指南 在系统中安装 Flatpak，然后从终端运行以下命令进行安装。

flatpak install flathub org.gnome.Boxes


使用 GNOME Boxes 创建虚拟机

从应用菜单启动 GNOME Boxes。

要创建虚拟机，你需要要虚拟化的操作系统的镜像（*.ISO）。

你可以从发行版的官方下载页面下载任何操作系统 ISO 镜像。对于本指南，我使用的是 Pop!_OS，这是一个优秀的 Linux 发行版。

                              <span>从商业化工具开始的探索
很久以前，我曾经试图用一个工具整合各种需求，即所谓「All in One」，结果却是让工具内部变得臃肿和笨重，后来还是逐渐放弃了。
现在，我做笔记用的是 Obsidian 和 Notion，任务管理用滴答清单，剪藏管理用 Cubox（都是少数派商店里面的好货）。这样将需求拆解到不同工具之后，很多复杂脚本被现成功能取代，工作确实简单了一些。但相应的代价则是需要在工具之间跳转，而它们的协作缺乏了一些「灵性」。
针对这种问题，市场上出现了许多基于 API 的自动化平台，试图让用户以较低门槛打通不同应用。这其中的行业领先者包括 Zapier 和 IFTTT 等，都是少数派读者耳熟能详的，在少数派上也有不少关的深度教程，例如：
  
经过检索，我发现在 AI 兴起之后，很多这类服务都快速添加了调用 OpenAI API 的功能。但是它们有一个共同的缺点（或者是我自己的缺点……），就是太贵了。可以对比一下此类产品的价格：
产品
                价格
            
Zapier
                免费用户每月 100 次任务。最低升级价格 $20/月，含 750 次任务
            
IFTTT
                免费用户可保存 3 个自动化（Applets）。含有 AI 功能的升级方案升级 $5/月
            
集简云
                免费用户每月 500 次执行。升级一年 ￥1990，每月可执行 1500 次
            
HiFlow（腾讯轻联）
                免费用户每月 1000 次执行。升级一年 ￥980，每月 3000 次
            
原则上，我是非常支持为互联网企业的创新功能付费的，但是日常用户的需求并没有强烈到能支撑这种价格。特别是 Zapier，已经像是「轻奢品」的范畴了。
本文中，我将介绍自己如何搭建开源、可自建的自动化工具 n8n，并演示几个真实用例。在此基础上，我将对用自动化工具辅助工作的未来提出一些展望，以及就个人如何跟进这新的一轮「产业革命」提出些小小看法。
在经历一系列摸索之后，我最终找到了一个可用且免费的替代品——n8n。
n8n 是一个开源的自动化控制台。它具有设计简洁的图形界面，可以非常清晰地展示数据在各种服务之间流动的过程。对于入门用户，n8n 提供了丰富的模板，也有活跃的社区支持。

n8n 提供官方托管服务，定价也不便宜。但得益于开源属性，可以比较方便地在自己的 NAS 或 VPS 上部署，从而不需要任何额外开销。
用 Docker Compose 安装 n8n
n8n 的安装方式有多种选择，我选择的是 Docker Compose 方案，这也是一种比较容易上手的方案。（下面的步骤假定读者掌握基本的终端操作，且已经安装好 Docker。）
[ 编注：我们之前会员文章介绍过的 YunoHost 也可以快速安装 n8n。]

                              <span>6月28日，菜鸟集团宣布推出自营的品质快递业务：菜鸟速递。菜鸟速递历经六年打造，由服务天猫超市的配送业务升级为全国快递网络，主打半日达、当次日达、送货上门和夜间揽收等品质服务，在全国近三百城提供晚到、破损必赔，不上门必赔，在途拦截和在途更改目的地等五个100%承诺。


据了解，菜鸟速递是适应市场上对高质量快递需要而生，主要聚焦“菜鸟自营、品质快递、好用不贵”，服务上对标行业最优，价格上兼具性价比，并按照时效和重量提供丰富的产品矩阵，覆盖大件、中小件和微小件等全重量级包裹。


“中国快递市场发展得足够快、也足够大，需要物流行业提供多层次的供给，菜鸟希望打造更具性价比的品质服务，满足商家不断出现的新需求。”菜鸟集团CEO万霖表示。


六年前，由于市场上高质量快递供给不足，尤其是高性价比品质快递服务的稀缺，菜鸟速递开始着手搭建落地配网络，支撑天猫超市等阿里内部自营业务的发展，逐步将消费者体验提升到行业领先水平。


六年来，市场对品质快速服务的需求不断攀升，但供给持续紧缺。菜鸟的这张落地配网络也引发市场关注，不断有商家提出希望菜鸟开放自营物流能力。随着菜鸟搭建全国性的干线运输、转运网络，全面将落地配网络升级为具有跨区域配送、揽派一体的全国性快递网络，菜鸟速递正式推出。


6月28日，在全球智慧物流峰会现场，认养一头牛、青岛啤酒、添可、欧珀莱、盒马和银泰百货等客户与菜鸟速递签约，意味着菜鸟速递已全面向市场开放。同时菜鸟速递也接入菜鸟供应链，与菜鸟仓组成了优选仓配半日达服务，为商家提供仓配一体化的品质服务，提升消费者体验。


据介绍，乳业龙头伊利在天猫上的部分旗舰店去年开始试用菜鸟速递服务，物流问题投诉下降30%，大促物流成本下降30%，退货率也少了一倍，且老客户复购占比提升了10%。


快递行业专家赵小敏认为，菜鸟速递的推出，实质上是响应市场的需求，“菜鸟速递对快递市场来说是一种有益补充，消费市场容量足够大，还有广阔的发展空间，并不会与通达系等经济型快递形成直接竞争关系。”


菜鸟速递是今年菜鸟重点建设的国内物流业务产品。菜鸟还在加快国际快递和海外本地快递的建设。据悉，未来十年，菜鸟将着力建设一张全球领先的智慧物流网络，打造国内、跨境和海外本地等三大长链物流网络，同时形成末端驿站、物流地产和物流科技等三大短链业务。

                              <span>《繁花 : 批注本》，金宇澄著，沈宏非批注，姜庆共排版，长江文艺出版社，2023年6月出版，682页，98.00元

《繁花》出了一个新版。金宇澄著，沈宏非批注，姜庆共排版。排版先生上封面，罕见，但也因此看得出，沈宏非的批注有多激情，搞得姜先生一会让朱色批注在墨色正文间横躺，一会又竖插一个对话框，夹批与侧批齐飞，段批共尾批一色，也算印刷史上无前例的文本。
当然，批注本的好看，还不在皮相。金宇澄不响，沈宏非狂批。沈爷不仅充分展现自己食神本色，遇到“菜泡饭”“虾籽鲞鱼”“烂糊三鲜汤”“糯米双酿团”“西湖莼菜羹”这样的地方美食，立马展现专业知识和个人权威，而且一手一脚提溜进汁水丰富的历史人文，比如拾玖章提到“走油蹄髈”，沈爷先讲了蹄髈做法，又补上花絮：“‘文革’后落实政策，大笔钱财突然从天而降，世面却无车无房无奢侈品可购、无股票可炒，唯有猛吃，鱼翅、鲍鱼登场之前，‘走油蹄髈’‘全鸡全鸭’一度成为发还抄家财物者‘报复社会’之首选，曾有人日进一簋，月余暴卒。”
跟“食”关联度最高的“色”事，沈爷更是手到擒来如数家珍。金爷小说中，让年轻读者略感门槛的是，对五六十年代穿着和时尚的表达，沈爷凭着半个世纪在色相上的造诣，一一圈画，即便我们这种有点阅历的南方读者，亦大开眼界。
小说第六章，梅瑞告诉康总，她妈终于离婚了，在家清理衣服，织锦缎棉袄，罩衫，横贡缎棉袄，灯芯绒裤子，卡其裤子，两用衫，春秋呢大衣，法兰绒短大衣，派克大衣，哔叽长裤，舍维尼长裤，中长纤维两用衫，朝阳格衬衫，泡泡纱裙子，腈纶开司米三翻领，湖绉荷叶滚边裙，蓝棠皮鞋，江青裙，列宁装等等等等，沈宏非都以饕餮的快乐，色色批注。看好了，“斜纹布西服装大翻领”，“中横布带一根，束起来显腰身”，“‘集各朝女服之大成’设计的开襟V字领连衫裙，裙下摆至小腿中部，有使其（如中山装）成为女性‘国服’之意”，而且，这些食色交融的批注和老金的原文辉映成…</span>

                              <span>《天赐之日》，[荷兰]高罗佩著，张凌译，上海译文出版社2023年4月出版，184页，45.00元

众所周知，荷兰汉学家高罗佩（Robert Hans van Gulik，1910-1967）以其融中国公案与西方侦探于一体的《大唐狄公案》闻名世界，该系列悬疑小说是以唐代政治家狄仁杰（字怀英，630-700）为主角，作者虚构了他破案、断案的故事。但很少有人知道，1964 年，也即高氏去世前三年，他还出版了《天赐之日》（The Given Day）——一部几乎完全摒弃狄公系列小说创作风格的黑帮犯罪小说，尽管依旧有一个以正压邪的结局和令男主人公心旌摇曳的美女配角，但作者对故事人物、场景、题材、结构等均作了较大创新，正如荷兰小说家与评论家扬威廉（Janwillem Van de Wetering，1931-2008）在“后记”中所云，此书是高罗佩试图将其“荷兰性”与他在远东接触到的禅学调和起来的尝试。至于这一尝试是否成功，众说纷纭、见仁见智。本文意在展现《天赐之日》对狄公系列小说的新变，并进一步剖析高氏离开狄公赐予的舒适圈，涉足一个从未尝试过的新领域的原因。
相较于《大唐狄公案》，《天赐之日》并非探案小说，而是较为典型的西方犯罪小说，一般来讲，犯罪小说的创作宗旨在于塑造社会共同的道德体系，用紧张刺激的阅读体验、推理解谜的思维乐趣和惩恶扬善的正义主题引导人们遵守法律、和谐相处。但《天赐之日》突破了这一传统主旨，意在彰显更高精神层面的超拔。为达到这一目的，高公首先挣脱了狄公的束缚，为《天赐之日》带来了诸多具有鲜明西方性和现代性的新变。
首先是主人公之变。《天赐之日》由唐武周时期的著名政治家狄仁杰变身为前殖民地也即荷属东印度政府官员约翰·亨德里克斯，前者是满腹经纶、清正廉洁、才德卓绝的“斗南一人”；后者则是爪哇某城的地区副主管和巡回法官，二战期间失去妻女及一切的日军战俘，战后身无长物的老…</span>

                              <span>Hey guys,
Endless is an open-source mobile app that curates posts from your favorite websites in one place with a common interface. The application uses custom extractors specifically written for each website. This way you can endlessly scroll through posts and save the ones you like without having to deal with ads.
With the Endless server I am hosting you can also upvote and leave comments on posts without creating an account! With random tokens linked to your actions you basically use your device as your account and undo your actions in the future without spoiling your identity.
I hope to add more extractors in the future. Feel free to install the app and check out the extractors yourself or contribute to the project! I always love to hear your comments and feedback.

 Or would it be the case of just using ftp and ssh?

                              <span>Hi, I started using Linux today, and can&#x27;t get the equalizer to work. 
 Every time I open Pulse Effects, the audio played in Celluloid stutters every half-second, and becomes inaudible. And when I close Pulse Effects, it goes back to normal. 
 I tried Pipewire as alternative, but it got worse. This time the sound muted for every half-second. 
 I&#x27;m using Linux Mint 21.1. Are there other equalizers I can use? Or players that have equalizers already built in?

 k-means is one of the most widely-used algorithms to cluster data. However, it has several limitations: a) it requires the use of L2 distance for efficient clustering, which also b) restricts the data you&#x27;re clustering to be vectors, and c) doesn&#x27;t require the means to be datapoints in the dataset.
 Unlike in k-means, the k-medoids problem requires cluster centers to be actual datapoints, which permits greater interpretability of your cluster centers. k-medoids also works better with arbitrary distance metrics, so your clustering can be more robust to outliers if you&#x27;re …</span>

                              <span>I have a printer that prints both 4x6 and 4x4 labels. Currently I have to go into cups server and manually change the default print size when changing labels. Is there a way to automatically have cups change the default size?

                              <span>I work as a devops guy at a company. We&#x27;re using mostly Ubuntu VMs, and havent had any issues with it. I usually ask sysadmins to install the &quot;minimal&quot; version, and now we wanna test the cloud images provided by ubuntu. Security and stability-wise, should I consider Debian over Ubuntu? There&#x27;s a lot of sources saying it&#x27;s &quot;more stable&quot;. Does anyone have any (recent) actual experience with both, running on production critical systems?

                              <span>“mm_percpu_wq” is a kernel thread based on a workqueue which is created in the “init_mm_internals” function (https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v6.4-rc5/source/mm/vmstat.c#L2100). It is part of the the statistics management regarding virtual memory (https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v6.4-rc5/source/mm/vmstat.c#L5). An overview diagram of virtual memory is shown below.
 Overall, “mm_percpu_wq” is the worker thread which updates different counters about the virtual memory of a Linux system. It is also called the “vmstat worker” (https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v6.4-rc5/source/mm/vmstat.c#L2021). “vmstat” stands for “Virtual Memory Statistics” which includes information such as: number of free pages, number of mapped pages, number or dirty pages, amount of memory allocated to kernel stacks and more (there are more than 150 different counters).
 The statistics can be read from the file “/proc/vmstat” (https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man5/proc.5.html). This proc entry is created with others (“buddyinfo, “pagetypeinfo” and “zoneinfo”) in the same file in which “mm_percpu_mm” is allocated (https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v6.4-rc5/source/mm/vmstat.c#L2123). We can see the list of the metric counters in the source code (https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v6.4-rc5/source/mm/vmstat.c#L1168).
 As it names suggested the kernel thread is responsible for accumulating the vm events among all CPUs (https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v6.4-rc5/source/mm/vmstat.c#L126). It is done by going over all the “online” CPUs (https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v6.4-rc5/source/mm/vmstat.c#L117).

                              <span>Putting the potential GPL violations aside, why is this a big deal? It looks like:
  
Having a developer or student account to access RHEL binaries (and therefore sources) is free. A lot of people are complaining that the current changes are suicide for RHEL, but they&#x27;re not; changing this (without a properly free-as-in-beer alternative distribution for educational or testing purposes, like Rocky or Alma) would actually be long-term suicide since students wouldn&#x27;t be learning it as their primary server distro or gravitating towards in later on in their careers, and RHEL would look in ten years like HP-UX or AIX look today (still paying customers for support purposes, but relatively few new users), and RHEL is therefore unlikely to change this.

                              <span>For the first time I have to subscribe to a VPN service that allows to select servers in specific countries to connect to. Nord, Atlas, Express, SurfShark – their ads are everywhere.
 I would like to choose one that does not require their own software to be installed on my system. I would like to add VPN connections to my network manager, one for each exit point that I will use.
 Adding VPN connections to the network manager is quite easy using nm-connection-editor – but does this work with any commercial VPN service?

                              <span>I&#x27;m sure many of you probably experienced the bugginess of JetBrains Gateway and the native remote development solutions. Thankfully, after much experimenting, I found a way to use without any issues!
 I decided to document it in a YouTube video: https://youtu.be/WOnS994iO7U
 Or check out my blog post for specific instructions on setting it up: https://reemus.dev/article/jetbrains-remote-development-with-x2go
 I hope this saves you a lot of headache!

                              <span>I have an RTX3060 TI and a Ryzen 5 5600g. Want to get back to Linux from Windows after a gap of 6 years. I hear that Nvidia cards can have issues with the display if you run dual monitors that have variable refresh rates/resolutions (on Wayland). Is this still true?
 ​
 My main monitor is 1440p 144hz but I also use my older 1080P 75hz panel as a secondary display. Are the issues with Nvidia in this case bad enough to warrant a switch to an AMD card? I don&#x27;t mind getting a new RX 6800XT since they are available for around $500.
 ​
 Any insights would be appreciated.
 ​
 Edit: Forgot all about another major issue. I had to undervolt my GPU and put a custom fan curve on Afterburner to keep temps under 80c. It is a Zotac dual fan with underwhelming cooling. Ambient temps where I live can go as high as 32c in summer. I guess that&#x27;s another point for an AMD upgrade since apparently, you cannot undervolt NVidia on Linux?

                              <span>Converting a few 4K videos to 1080p, notice on htop my CPU temperature was 90* celsius. Wow! It reached 94.
 So, let&#x27;s limit my CPU Mhz. Installed sudo pacman -S linux-tools
 First use cpupower frequency-info too find available speeds:
 &quot;available frequency steps: 3.60 GHz, 3.20 GHz, 2.20 GHz&quot;
 Then I set my Ryzem 2600X to 3200 Mhz with the cpupower:
 sudo cpupower frequency-set --max 3200000
 Temperatures came down from 90 to 60 or below, and I was getting 36 fps and now 30 fps. So it is a nice trade off for low temperatures and take care of my cpu.
 You can configure HTOP to show the CPU Mhz and temperature, press F2 and in &quot;Display Options&quot;, there is &quot;Also show CPU frequency&quot; and &quot;Also show CPU temperature&quot;

                              <span>Hi, I am a Debian user and am looking to build a new system, something solid that&#x27;ll last a good while. I don&#x27;t need onboard wifi, which the Z590-A lacks, as I will only be using wired LAN, and I like that it has nice PCI-E slot options (3 x16 and an x4) and can take up to 128 GB (64 would be enough for my needs, though I like having room to go higher if needed.) I have a Radeon RX 6600 XT that I got for a good price a couple months ago but it still waiting to be used until I get everything else to build this system.
 One motherboard that I&#x27;ve come across that appears to meat my criteria is ASUS Prime Z590-A which is LGA 1200, which I found via:
 https://pcpartpicker.com/product/fwVmP6/asus-prime-z590-a-atx-lga1200-motherboard-prime-z590-a
 The problem is I am having a hard time fining good information of how well it might be supported by Debian 12, or Linux in general, so I would really appreciate any insight and guidance, as well as any good alternatives, including AMD boards. I just need similar PCI-E options as above (either multple x16s or one x16 and some x4 and/or x8 slots - I will only be running the one graphics card so one x16 is needed for that, I need other slots for a capture card and other hardware that are mainly x4 max.)
 Thanks.

                              <span>A discussion that largely centered around the documentation of
iomap, which provides a block-mapping interface for modern filesystems,
was led by Luis Chamberlain that the
2023 Linux Storage, Filesystem,
Memory-Management and BPF Summit. There is an ongoing process of
converting filesystems to use iomap, in order to leave buffer heads 
behind and to better support folios, so
the intent was to get feedback on the documentation from developers who are
working on those conversions.  One of the concrete outcomes of the session
was a plan to move that documentation from its current location on the
KernelNewbies wiki into
the kernel documentation.</span>

	Probably the single most common question I get from folks is, &quot;When
	will NVK be in upstream mesa?&quot; The short answer is that it&#x27;ll be
	upstreamed along with the new kernel API. The new API is going to
	be required in order to implement Vulkan correctly in a bunch of
	cases. Even though it mostly works on top of upstream nouveau, I
	don&#x27;t want to be maintaining support for that interface for another
	10 years when it only partially works.

	We don&#x27;t yet have an exact timetable for when the new API will be
	ready. I&#x27;m currently hoping that we get it all upstream this year

                              <span>你在“发行版快闪”中做错了什么？你能做得更好吗？当然可以。在这里，我们告诉你如何做。


“发行版快闪Distro hopping” 是指经常尝试新的 Linux 发行版，以寻找乐趣或找到适合你的完美发行版的习惯。

毕竟，有着 数百种 Linux 发行版，而且时不时就有新的版本出现。你可能会担心错过它们，而去尝试 Linux 社区的最新潮流。

无论你为何这样做，不管你喜欢与否，人们会犯下一些错误，这让“发行版快闪”的体验变得糟糕。

这些错误是什么？让我带你一一了解：

1、不进行备份



嗯，你想要更换发行版，由于过于兴奋，你毫不犹豫就切换了。

但是，如果你没有备份重要的、经常访问的数据，你可能需要重新配置系统和组织你需要的数据。

所以，如果你有备份，无论你做什么，你需要的数据始终可访问，并帮助你在发行版之间快速的跳来跳去。

2、不检查显卡的驱动支持



用户常常忽略发行版与其系统中的显卡的兼容性，而抱怨发行版有问题。

你必须确保你的发行版对你的显卡有开箱即用的支持。

如果你像我一样有一块英伟达显卡，你应该只选择提供带有英伟达支持的 ISO，或在启动菜单中内置了该支持的发行版。

例如，在 Linux Mint 上你需要 安装英伟达驱动。虽然大部分情况下这是一个简单且没什么麻烦的过程，但并不是每个人都愿意为之付出努力。你也可以选择 Pop!_OS 或 Ubuntu，它们默认情况下与英伟达显卡兼容良好。

3、抱有过高期望



没有谁能完美地挑选出你需要和你可能喜欢的东西。

所以，不要听从他人的建议。自己进行研究，选择你想尝试的下一个发行版。

即使你知道你想要什么，也不要期望新的发行版一定会比你当前的发行版更好。各个发行版在许多方面都有所不同。

你的下一个发行版可能解决了你遇到的问题，但也可能会带来你没有…</span>

互联网总是在消亡；多年来它一直在消亡，被那些从网站上转移流量的应用程序或奖励所谓缩短注意力的算法所杀死。但最近几个月，人工智能正在加速扼杀旧互联网。谷歌正试图改变其几十年一成不变的蓝色链接列表；领英使用人工智能来刺激疲劳的用户；Snapchat 和 Instagram 希望机器人能在你的朋友不在时与你交谈；Reddit 的版主们在抗议天价 API；Stack Overflow 的管理员们则在反对人工智能生成的内容；互联网档案馆正在对抗数据刮削者；维基百科正在被人工智能撕碎；聊天机器人们在反刍自己幻想出来的内容。

DeepMind 称其下一个人工智能系统将超过 ChatGPT

DeepMind 的 CEO 说，他们正在开发一个被称为 Gemini 的人工智能系统，该系统将比 OpenAI 的 ChatGPT 背后的系统更强大，Gemini 将结合 AlphaGo 中使用的技术，赋予该系统新的能力，如计划或解决问题的能力。AlphaGo 基于 DeepMind 的强化学习技术，通过反复尝试并接受关于其表现的反馈，学会处理需要选择采取何种行动的棘手问题。2016 年，AlphaGo 击败了人类棋手冠军，创造了历史。Gemini 仍在开发中，还将需要数月时间，它可能花费数千万乃至数亿美元。

澳大利亚建议居民每晚重启手机

澳大利亚政府告诉居民，作为一项网络安全措施，他们应该每天关闭和重新开启他们的智能手机。这个建议并不新鲜。2020 年，美国国家安全局发布了移动设备安全的最佳实践指南，其中包括每周重启一次智能手机以防止黑客攻击。网络安全专家称，定期重启手机可以将风险降到最低，因为它强行关闭了在后台运行的任何可能恶意监控用户或收集数据的应用程序和进程。

                        <a class="article-summary-link article-summary-box-outer" href="https://linux.cn/article-15947-1.html?utm_source&#x3D;rss&amp;utm_medium&#x3D;rss">
                          <div class="article-summary-box-inner media-object">

                              <span>以下是在 GNOME 版本的 Fedora 工作站中启用分数缩放的步骤。


分数缩放Fractional Scaling 是一项方便的功能，可让你最大程度地优化 HiDPI 显示器和高分辨率笔记本电脑。通过微调缩放比例，你可以创建平衡良好、既不太大也不太小且美观的桌面显示。虽然通过分辨率设置也可以，但由于操作系统的限制，它们通常符合你的实际情况。

此外，它还允许你增加显示屏上文本和其他 UI 元素的大小，而不会使所有内容显得模糊。如果你有高分辨率显示器并希望使文本更易于阅读，这将很有用。

Ubuntu 20.04 LTS 在 2020 年引入了 100%、125%、150%、175% 和 200% 的分数缩放。它可以在“显示Display”页面下的“设置Settings”中找到。

但在默认 GNOME 桌面的 Fedora 工作站中，只有 100% 和 200% 缩放可用。



如何使用 GNOME 在 Fedora 中启用分数缩放

打开终端窗口（CTRL+ALT+T）。

运行以下命令。此命令在带有 GNOME 的 Fedora 中启用 125%、150% 和 175% 缩放因子。

gsettings set org.gnome.mutter experimental-features &quot;[&#x27;scale-monitor-framebuffer&#x27;]&quot;


重启 Fedora。

打开 “设置” 应用，你应该会看到新的缩放因子。



但是，重要的是要注意分数缩放并不总是完美的。某些应用程序可能无法正确缩放。例如，如果应用程序设计不当，非 GTK 应用可能看起来很模糊。

此外，请务必注意，由于 GPU 的渲染工作量更大，分数缩放可能会增加笔记本电脑的功耗。

一些使用说明

根据我的测试，上述命令在 Wayland 中应该是有效的。

如果你不想使用上述命令，但仍想获得类似的体验，那么你可以按照以下步骤操作：

使用 sudo dnf install gnome-tweaks 安装 GNOME “调整Tweaks” 应用。

转到 “字体Fonts” 设置并更改比例因子。

示例：如果你想保持 100% 缩放比例但想要更大的字体，请尝试缩放比例设为 1.1 或 1.2。根据你的需要进行调整。




125%：这是分数缩放的典型值。它将文本大小和 UI 元素增加 25% 而不会使所有内容显得模糊。

150%：对于想要放大文本和其他 UI 元素但又不想增加显示分辨率的人来说，这是一个很好的值。

175%：对于想要使文本和其他 UI 元素变得非常大的人来说，这是一个很好的值。


尝试不同的缩放因子对于找到最适合你的缩放因子至关重要。最佳缩放因子将取决于你的显示器尺寸、视力和偏好。

我希望本指南有所帮助。

                              <span>通常，我用的是基于 Ubuntu 的发行版进行工作，如 Pop!_OS、Zorin OS、Linux Mint 或 Ubuntu 本身。

它们不会干扰我的工作，同时又提供了顺滑的软件更新。更不用说，它们与我使用的英特尔-英伟达系统相容性良好。

所有的一切（可能是主观的）都能开箱即用。

然而，最近我决定在实体机上切换到 Arch Linux（我大部分时间都是在虚拟机上使用它）。

结果，我最终选择使用了 Manjaro Linux（一款基于 Arch 的发行版）。

我选择 Manjaro Linux 的原因

令我惊讶的是，即使是使用 Arch Linux 的立付 USB，我甚至无法解决 “nouveau DRM: core notifier timeout” 错误，更别提继续安装了。是的，我知道有向导式的 Arch Linux 安装程序，但是不论怎么样，连接的显示器都会闪烁并突出显示这个错误。

解决这个问题的最好办法是不使用我的最近刚刚升级的英伟达显卡。

很遗憾，我更喜欢英伟达的显卡……

AMD 的 RX 6600 XT 的价格与 RTX 3060 Ti 相当；对于 1440p 来说，购买那款显卡是没有意义的。

因此，在我这个情况下，RTX 3060 Ti 可能是问题所在。

虽然我找到了一些解决问题的方法，但是我太懒了。我只是想看看能否在不用付出太多努力的情况下体验一下 Arch Linux。

所以，我做了以下的事情：

下一个最佳选择就是尝试任何一个专门简化了麻烦的 最佳的基于 Arch 的发行版，对吧？

这就是 Manjaro Linux 登场的地方。

Manjaro Linux 是一款流行的基于 Arch 的发行版，并且我注意到每次更新时都有各种改进（在虚拟机上使用时）。

此外，我喜欢 Manjaro 默认主题…</span>

                              <span>《繁花 : 批注本》，金宇澄著，沈宏非批注，姜庆共排版，长江文艺出版社，2023年6月出版，682页，98.00元

《繁花》出了一个新版。金宇澄著，沈宏非批注，姜庆共排版。排版先生上封面，罕见，但也因此看得出，沈宏非的批注有多激情，搞得姜先生一会让朱色批注在墨色正文间横躺，一会又竖插一个对话框，夹批与侧批齐飞，段批共尾批一色，也算印刷史上无前例的文本。
当然，批注本的好看，还不在皮相。金宇澄不响，沈宏非狂批。沈爷不仅充分展现自己食神本色，遇到“菜泡饭”“虾籽鲞鱼”“烂糊三鲜汤”“糯米双酿团”“西湖莼菜羹”这样的地方美食，立马展现专业知识和个人权威，而且一手一脚提溜进汁水丰富的历史人文，比如拾玖章提到“走油蹄髈”，沈爷先讲了蹄髈做法，又补上花絮：“‘文革’后落实政策，大笔钱财突然从天而降，世面却无车无房无奢侈品可购、无股票可炒，唯有猛吃，鱼翅、鲍鱼登场之前，‘走油蹄髈’‘全鸡全鸭’一度成为发还抄家财物者‘报复社会’之首选，曾有人日进一簋，月余暴卒。”
跟“食”关联度最高的“色”事，沈爷更是手到擒来如数家珍。金爷小说中，让年轻读者略感门槛的是，对五六十年代穿着和时尚的表达，沈爷凭着半个世纪在色相上的造诣，一一圈画，即便我们这种有点阅历的南方读者，亦大开眼界。
小说第六章，梅瑞告诉康总，她妈终于离婚了，在家清理衣服，织锦缎棉袄，罩衫，横贡缎棉袄，灯芯绒裤子，卡其裤子，两用衫，春秋呢大衣，法兰绒短大衣，派克大衣，哔叽长裤，舍维尼长裤，中长纤维两用衫，朝阳格衬衫，泡泡纱裙子，腈纶开司米三翻领，湖绉荷叶滚边裙，蓝棠皮鞋，江青裙，列宁装等等等等，沈宏非都以饕餮的快乐，色色批注。看好了，“斜纹布西服装大翻领”，“中横布带一根，束起来显腰身”，“‘集各朝女服之大成’设计的开襟V字领连衫裙，裙下摆至小腿中部，有使其（如中山装）成为女性‘国服’之意”，而且，这些食色交融的批注和老金的原文辉映成…</span>

                              <span>民国时期，晚明文人张岱（1597-1689？）的文章著述颇受读书界的重视，其中以周作人（1885-1967）为核心的文人群体为最著。当前学界对张岱民国时期接受史的研究多聚焦于周作人及其弟子——整理出版《陶庵梦忆》的俞平伯（1900-1990），而对另一位与《西湖梦寻》《琅嬛文集》关系颇为密切的苦雨斋弟子沈启无（1902-1969）关注相对不足，笔者因撰小文，略述细节，聊备掌故。
一、缘起《近代散文抄》
沈启无对张岱的接受与推崇，盖与周作人有关。1927年4月，朴社重刊本《陶庵梦忆》面世，该本系据清咸丰间《粤雅堂丛书》刊本整理。周作人为此本作序云：“他（引按：张岱）所选的《一卷冰雪文》曾在大路的旧书店中见过，因索价太昂未曾买得。”大抵是有鉴于此，沈启无于1930年9月编定的明清散文小品选本即以《冰雪小品》名之。该书起初因故未刊，1932年9月改名《近代散文抄》由北平人文书店出版。书中选录张岱散文二十八篇，为入选诸家之最。
沈启无编选《近代散文抄》时亦受周作人影响颇著，尤其是编选张岱散文的过程大抵可考。今按《近代散文抄》书末“抄撮书目”即载有“《张子诗文粃》二十三卷”“《琅嬛文集》十六卷”。其中“《张子诗文粃》二十三卷”系鄞马廉（字隅卿）旧藏清稿本《琅嬛文集》二十三卷十二册，分为《张子文粃》十八卷八册，《张子诗粃》五卷四册（下简称“清稿本”。按马廉《不登大雅文库书目》著录《张子诗粃》为四卷，盖第五卷残损过甚故），今藏国家图书馆（索书号：A01784）。该本为套格纸抄本，版心下方镌“凤嬉堂”，页眉行间有王雨谦评语。

至于所谓“《琅嬛文集》十六卷”，北京师范大学图书馆杨健先生撰《周作人校藏本〈琅嬛文集〉略考》（载于《鲁迅研究月刊》2018年第1期）指出其中的“《琅嬛文集》十六卷”即周作人旧藏清光绪刊本六卷（下简称“刊本”），此处“十…</span>

                              <span>I&#x27;ve built a new PC, and this is something interesting, htop is reporting way less for ram usage.
 https://i.imgur.com/9buiHmy.png
 The actual ram usage is about 10 GiB, which is what top, fastfetch and free -gh are reporting, but htop is reporting 6.5 GiB? Why is that? I also tried launching htop with its default config and I still get the same issue.
 This is the first time this has ever happened btw.

                              <span>Hi, everyone. I just started with Linux a few days ago and began with Arch. I am absolutely loving my OS, everything is pretty much setup the way I want it. I&#x27;m wondering what sort of programs I&#x27;m missing out on by being on Linux. I know Adobe has been a problem, but is there anything else? Is there some page or something with info on this? Basically, I&#x27;m trying to figure out what complications I could run into in the future in regards to software compatibility.

                              <span>today is my 32nd birthday. and before I get to my question I want to quickly talk about myself. I have a micro-enterprise which sells Linux/digital security courses etc. I also have a youtube channel that talks about linux with more than 30k subscribers which generates me a small income of 120 dolars.
 I work remotely from home and this is how I keep my self, my wife and 4 kids.
 I need suggestions and tips for my first job in the sysadmin area. I have a good experience with linux and I&#x27;ve been a user since 2005, I&#x27;ve always been a lot of tinkering and I use distributions like gentoo/slackware. I have good knowledge in Shell Scripts and backup schemes. I keep some VPS with Debian/Centos (deceased)/Slackware with the most varied services like moodle, irc, libreddit, email (postfix), tor, elog and anything else that comes to mind.
 And today on my birthday I woke up very determined to work in the area (for real). A lot, I love this area, I love the command line, I love configuration files. Some details: * I am fully self-taught * I don&#x27;t have college * I have several courses on udemy (I don&#x27;t know if it helps) * I&#x27;m autistic, and linux is my hyperfocus since 2005, I love it deeply. * I like to write documentation and organize scripts etc...
 A peculiar detail is that, as I am autistic, I cannot work outside the home, that is, it needs to be remotely because I cannot go out and be locked up somewhere (I have panic attacks)
 english Well, what would be your tip to put on my resume?
 I am Brazilian.

                              <span>Hey Reddit community,
 I&#x27;m in a dilemma and need your advice. I&#x27;m looking for a Linux distribution that prioritizes bug fixes and provides quick security updates without focusing too much on additional features. After some research, I&#x27;ve narrowed down my options to Fedora and Ubuntu LTS, but I&#x27;m having trouble deciding which one would be the better choice.
 On one hand, Fedora is known for its cutting-edge nature and frequent updates, which could potentially mean faster bug fixes and security patches. However, the rapid pace of development may also introduce new bugs or stability issues.
 On the other hand, Ubuntu LTS (Long Term Support) versions are designed to provide a stable and reliable experience over an extended period. They prioritize bug fixes and security updates while minimizing major changes, making them ideal for users who value stability.
 Considering my primary focus on bug fixes and quick security updates, which distribution do you think would be the better choice for me? Have you had any personal experiences with either Fedora or Ubuntu LTS regarding their maintenance and support?
 I appreciate any insights, opinions, or personal experiences you can share to help me make an informed decision. Thanks in advance!

                              <span>Apologies but asking here as /r/linuxquestions is still locked.
 I work for a private ISP, we sell managed networks to customers with various services. I have a VMware ESXi server, and to simplify things let&#x27;s say it currently has 10 VMs, each VM having a management NIC, and a customer VLAN NIC. Currently I can use a service like NRPE to execute commands on each VM, and NRPE runs a networking command (like a cURL, ping, or similar) over the customer network NIC. The NRPE agent listens on the management NIC, but executes the commands over the customer VLAN NIC.
 Customer wise, for simplicity we&#x27;ll say customers are called Customer1, Customer2, Customer3, and so on. Their VLANs correspond like 10, 20, 30, and so on. Each customer network has an identical IP space of 10.0.0.0/8, and the IP of this VM will be identical in each of the networks.
 I&#x27;m building a new VM which has a single management NIC, and a single trunk NIC (VLAN 4095 in VMware parlance). I&#x27;ve tested configuring the secondary NIC on the VM as Customer1 with VLAN 10 tagged, and that works fine (so the port is all good), but I&#x27;m having trouble with network namespaces. My end goal is to be able to run commands like ip netns exec customer1 ping 8.8.8.8 and get the results (quick crap example, but you get the idea).
 I tried to borrow the principles from this article but it wouldn&#x27;t work for me. 
 Update: Now resolved thanks to /u/J4yD4n suggestion of splitting the trunk interface in to separate per-VLAN subints and then attaching namespaces to them individually.

                              <span>Right now, I’m only able to terminate one session at a time with the ‘tmux kill-session’ command. 
 I’m aware I can write a sh script that loops over the session names as the arguments (eg. for session in $@), BUT the problem is this doesn’t allow for Tab autocompletion of the session name. Since my session names are pretty long/specific , having this would be super helpful.
 Any thoughts on how to resolve this are appreciated. Thank you!

It&#x27;s not a replacement for my 16&quot; HP Spectre running Debian, but it&#x27;s sort of a small companion laptop for when I don&#x27;t want a full size laptop.
 I tried to log into Chase.com, and saw it gave me a &quot;we&#x27;ve enhanced our platform&quot; error on ARM when it allows x86 Linux fine. I called Chase and they said to &quot;call a Geek Squad&quot; or &quot;call Apple&quot; while claiming &quot;we can&#x27;t do anything&quot;, basically blaming Apple. As if Apple is responsible for Debian&#x27;s Asahi remix and Firefox on ARM Linux. I fought them and they said &quot;OK, we can send it to our analysts to check&quot;.
 Yes, Apple is responsible for making hardware and not releasing FOSS drivers. Apple isn&#x27;t responsible for Chase allowing x86 Linux but n…</span>

                              <span>Hi HN, this is my efforts in reverse engineering a BLE car battery monitor where it&#x27;s app has over 100,000 downloads on the Google Play store alone.
It turns out it&#x27;s sending GPS, cell phone tower cell IDs and Wifi beacon data to servers in Hong Kong and mainland China on a continued basis. Google and Apple app store pages say no personal data is collected or sent to 3rd parties.
Hopefully readers pick up a few tips on reversing apps for their connected devices.

                              <span>I worked on a web service that allows you to import a song and define a target length that the song will be shortened or lengthened to. It does this by analyzing the song and finding repeating audio patterns. This is helpful for making any song match a video or performance with a set duration. You can also specify areas of the song to prefer or avoid. An example is available here: https://mofi.loud.red/edit/8bd3fdf780f8c3927e41029f3b957f8a7...
The cool thing is that after the song is analyzed on the server, the client can recompute and preview the results completely client-side through an implementation that uses Web Workers and WebAssembly. The audio previewing uses Tone.js. I am thinking of writing up some more details about the implementation in the future.
I&#x27;m still working on a way to explain this easily, but I like the idea of carrying over the concept of content-aware fill from images to audio.
Please let me know if you have any comments or questions!

Argonaut combines Kubernetes PaaS, a CI pipeline builder, and a Terraform state manager with prebuilt AWS and GCP modules. Here’s a demo: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;8DZsYXxA2tQ.
I’ve helped build infrastructure tooling from scratch at multiple companies and realized two things: that the shape of the solution with the advent of containerization, Kubernetes, and hyperscalers is quite similar across orgs, and that highly knowledgeable engineers are needed to build and manage this system.

                              <span>Red Hat&#x27;s Mike McGrath responds
to the many criticisms aimed at the company since it changed its policy
regarding RHEL source code.


	Ultimately, we do not find value in a RHEL rebuild and we are not
	under any obligation to make things easier for rebuilders; this is
	our call to make. That brings me to CentOS Stream, of which there
	is immense confusion. I acknowledge that this is a change in a
	longstanding tradition where we went above and beyond, and change
	like this can cause some confusion. That confusion manifested as
	accusations about us going closed-source and about alleged GPL
	violations. There is CentOS Stream the binary deliverable, and
	CentOS Stream the source repository. The CentOS Stream
	gitlab source is where we build RHEL releases, in the open for
	all to see. To call RHEL “closed source” is categorically untrue
	and inaccurate. CentOS Stream moves faster than RHEL, so it might
	not be on HEAD, but the code is there. If you can’t find it, it’s a
	bug – please let us know.</span>

on June 25 after a nine-week development cycle.  By that point, 14,835
non-merge changesets had been pulled into the mainline kernel, a slight

development cycles.  As usual, LWN has taken a look at those changesets,

	Most of the stuff in my mailbox the last week has been about
	upcoming things for 6.5, and I already have 15 pull requests
	pending. I appreciate all you proactive people.

	But that&#x27;s for tomorrow. Today we&#x27;re all busy build-testing the
	newest kernel release, and checking that it&#x27;s all good. Right?


Headline features in this release include:
generic iterators for BPF,
the removal of the SELinux runtime disable
knob,
the removal of the SLOB memory allocator,
linear address masking support on Intel
CPUs,
process-level samepage merging control,
support for user trace events,
more infrastructure for writing kernel modules in Rust,
per-VMA locks,
and much more.
See the LWN merge-window summaries (part 1, part 2), and the (in-progress) KernelNewbies 6.4 page for
the details.</span>

                              <span>早些时候，苹果曾宣布，将在今年7月关闭iCloud的免费功能“My Photo Stream”（我的照片流），这一推出十余年的服务即将被弃用。近日，有用户发现，用户已经无法为我的照片流功能上传任何新的图片。


而根据苹果方面发布的公告，从6月26日起，新照片将停止从设备上传到“我的照片流”，在该日期之前上传到此服务的照片将在iCloud中保留30天（自上传日期起）。也就是说，最迟在7月26日中，iCloud中将不会保留任何通过该服务上传的图片，服务也正式关闭。


“My Photo Stream”服务于 2011 年由史蒂夫・乔布斯作为 iCloud 的一部分推出，可以自动将一个设备上的照片和视频上传到另一个设备上，无需手动同步。这项功能不占用免费的 5GB iCloud 存储空间，但只能存储 1000 个文件，并且不支持全分辨率同步。


苹果公司后来推出了 iCloud Photo Library（现在称为 iCloud Photos），作为一个功能齐全的照片和视频同步服务。iCloud Photos 需要付费订阅 iCloud 才能使用超过免费的 5GB iCloud 的存储空间，套餐从每月 0.99 美元起，可选 50GB 到 2TB 不等。


在关闭我的照片流服务的同时，苹果建议用户更换使用iCloud Photos服务，并给出了具体操作流程：


在iPhone、iPad或iPod touch上


1、打开照片并点击相册；


2、点击我的照片流&gt;选择；


3、点击你想要保存的照片，然后点击分享按钮&gt;保存图片。


在Mac上


1、打开照片应用，然后打开我的照片流相册；


2、选择你想要保存但目前不在你的照片库中的任何照片；


3、将它们从我的照片流相册拖到你的库中。</span>

英伟达最新 GPU 黑市价格翻番

去年，美国商务部阻止了包括英伟达和 AMD 在内的美国顶级硬件公司向中国和俄罗斯出售其最先进的芯片。其中，英伟达的 A100 和 H100 GPU 属于出口管制的对象。这导致这些芯片在黑市的价格达到了 2 万美元，比正常价格高一倍，并且没有保修和支持。

                              <span>开发人员可以通过将开源软件集成到其代码库中，节省时间并避免重复发明轮子。然而，这也带来了严重的许可侵权风险。你必须遵守适用于重新使用的开源代码的众多开源许可证之一。如果你不这样做，你（或你所在公司）有可能因违反开源许可证条款而被起诉。即使这种诉讼并不普遍发生，它们确实存在。实际上，考虑到现在许多开源项目由希望保护其在开源社区中的投资的企业运营，这种情况在未来可能更加频繁发生。

1、熟悉开源许可证

了解开源许可证是防止开源许可侵权问题中最重要的一步。很容易认为所有开源许可证都施加相同的条件，或者它们都基本要求源代码的持续可用性。实际上，有数十种不同的开源许可证，它们都有着非常不同的条款。简单地认为只要你从一个开源项目获取代码，你可以随意使用它并保持源代码可访问，这是一个严重的错误。几个开源许可证的一个典型但经常被忽视的条件可能是需要向原始作者提供致谢。

2、记录你使用的开源内容

建立一个标准化的方法来记录你使用开源代码的情况是一个优秀的做法。导入模块或从 GitHub 粘贴代码并不难。但如果你不追踪代码来自何处以及使用了何种许可证，你可能会忘记在代码库中如何以及在哪里集成开源内容。此外，如果你在借用代码时无法证明自己遵守了有效的许可条件，那么在开源许可证发生变化时可能会产生问题。考虑在文档维基（如果有的话）中添加一个页面，列出你使用的开源代码，以避免出现这个问题。每当你包含开源组件或依赖时，至少在你自己的源代码中添加注释。

3、避免使用未经授权的开源组件

有时，你可能会偶然发现一个隐藏的 GitHub 存储库或其他源代码托管位置，其中包含你希望使用的代码，但没有提到任何许可指南。你可能会认为代码的创建者希望让其成为开源代码，并且你可以根据自己的意愿使用它。但这是一个危险的假设。开发人员可能会后续对代码设置特定的许可条件，并要求你遵守这些条件，这可能导致未来产生许可侵权的指控。除非你有非常充分的理由，否则避免使用缺乏明确许可限制的模糊代码。

4、创建自己的开源代码

将你自己的软件完全开源是减少与开源许可相关风险的一种方法。这意味着你将自动遵守任何要求保留派生源代码的开源许可条件。然而，请记住，仅仅开放你自己的代码并不能确保完全遵守许可证。你仍然需要努力确保你遵守每个许可证的规定，因为适用于你借用的代码的许可证可能与你选择的开源许可证不同。然而，你无需担心与源代码共享相关的任何条款。

5、自动检测开源组件

虽然在代码库内手动跟踪你如何使用开源是很好的做法，但通过使用能够自动识别开源组件和依赖项的软件，你可以降低出错的可能性。在这里，我们应该考虑两种不同类型的工具。一种是源代码组成分析（SCA）软件，它会自动扫描源代码并识别从值得信任的外部来源获取的元素。另一种是软件供应链管理解决方案，除其他功能外，还支持查找和监控应用程序堆栈中的任何开源依赖项。

                              <span>采用 Apache APISIX 的 API 主导架构。


API 网关是一个单一节点，提供对 API 调用入口。网关聚合了所请求的服务，并相应传回合适的响应信息。为了令你的 API 网关有效地工作，设计一个可靠、高效且简洁地 API 至关重要。本文介绍一种设计风格，但只要你理解其中的重点内容，它就能解决你的相关问题。

由 API 主导的方法

API 主导的方法是将 API 置于应用程序和它们需要访问的业务能力之间的通信核心，从而在所有数字通道上一致地交付无缝功能。API 主导的连接是指使用一种可重用、且设计得当的 API 来连接数据和应用程序的方法。

API 主导的架构

API 主导的架构是一种架构方法，它着眼于实现重用 API 的最佳方式。它能解决以下问题：


保护 API，使外界无法在未授权情况下访问 API

确保应用程序能找到正确的 API 端点

限制对 API 的请求次数，从而确保持续的可用性

支持持续集成、测试、生命周期管理、监控、运维等等

防止错误在栈间传播

对 API 的实时监测和分析

实现可伸缩和灵活的业务能力（例如支持 微服务 架构）


API 资源路由

实现一个 API 网关，把它作为与所有服务通信的单一入口点，意味着使用者只需要知道 URL 就能使用 API。将请求路由到相应的服务端点，并执行相应的功能是 API 网关的职责。



由于客户端应用程序不需要从多个 HTTP 端点调用功能，这个办法就减少了 API 使用者的操作复杂度。对每个服务来说，也不需实现一个单独的层级去实现认证、授权、节流和速度限制。大多数API 网关，如开源的 Apache APISIX，已经包含了这些核心功能。

API 基于内容的路由

基于内容的路由机制也使用 API 网关根据请求的内容进行路由调用。…</span>

春天时，听完了杰森·萨默的《什穆尔的桥：跟随我的幸存者父亲回访奥斯维辛》的有声书。再读实体书时，已是初秋。
新冠的第三个夏天太美丽，忙着旅行、享用花草瓜果，不宜也不应该阅读这样严肃、凝重的书。疫情虽然没有结束，但世界上大部分地区的人们都恢复了从前夏天的活动。最明显的，便是旅行。回故乡，或是就地重逢，或是前往陌生的远方。旅行，是人们制造或者寻找记忆的地方。
然而，一进9月，天气转凉，空气似乎也便凝重了起来。9月18日，美国公共广播电台（PBS）上播出了知名纪录片制作人肯·伯恩斯的纪录片《美国和大屠杀》（United States and the Holocaust），三集，六个小时。九·一八，中国人自然会想起“从那个悲惨的时候”。
记住回忆。
大屠杀：读不完的书，看不完的电影
第一次接触大屠杀题材，看的是梅丽尔·斯特里普主演的四集电视剧《大屠杀》。那之后不久，在长江航船上读到了《安妮·弗兰克日记》。在美国读书期间，去欧洲参加过一次上海前犹太居民的会议，从那次会议上，第一次听幸存者的后代说，他们很多人没有见过自己的祖父母。“大屠杀”这个题目，一下子具体化了，变成了家族树上断裂的链条。
以色列作家阿摩司·奥兹在他的回忆录《爱与黑暗的故事》(A Tale of Love and Darkness)中，生动地描写了母亲的出生地，位于乌克兰境内的罗夫诺，却一直不愿意前往访问。后来，他的女儿范尼亚·奥兹代他前往。他的小说《轻抚水，轻抚风》（Touch the Water, Touch the Wind），对在德国文化中侵染多年，却一夜之间沦为流亡者，在黑暗的森林中藏匿逃生的犹太青年充满了温柔的同情。

沈周（1427-1509）作为吴门画派的领袖名闻于当时，“评者谓为明世第一”（《明史》卷二九八）；但他不仅是画家，也是隐士，既不参加科考，亦拒绝征召，终生未仕。与传统的离群索居、遗世高蹈的隐者形象不同，沈周一生雅集不断，应酬频繁，弟子文徵明在《沈先生行状》中记载：“晚岁名益盛，客至亦益多，户屦常满。先生既老，而聪明不衰，酬对终日，不少厌怠。风流文物，照映一时。”（《甫田集》卷二十五）沈周隐居的有竹居，不像安静的世外桃源，更似热闹的文化中心，“每黎明，门未辟，舟已塞乎其港矣。先生固喜客，至则相与䜩笑咏歌，出古图书器物，摸抚品题，酬对终日不厌”（王鏊《石田先生墓志铭》）。沈周的交游对象，当然也不仅仅是布衣山人、方外僧道，各种地方官员乃至馆阁诸公，都与其过从甚密。虽然沈周自称“酷爱林泉图上见，生憎官府酒边谈”（《市隐》），但他并不排斥政治，回避官员，甚至主动与官员交接。当下的研究者几乎都注意到了这一点，认为沈周与官宦的交往对提高其声誉、传播其作品起了重要作用。但是这种交游是如何影响沈周在美术与文学上的具体创作，在吴门画派的崛起过程中又有何作用？涉及者尚寥寥无几。

沈周《沧洲趣图》卷（局部）

沈周作为吴门画派创始人，是美术界关注的热点，仅在“中国知网”数据库中以“沈周”为标题进行检索，近十年（2012-2022）来平均每年都有三十篇以上的论文发布，其中秦晓磊博士先后发表的《与邑作奇观——沈周、文徵明笔下的虞山古桧》（《故宫博物院学刊》2018年第2期）、《李东阳对沈周绘画的鉴藏——兼论北京文官与沈周的互动》（《中国国家博物馆馆刊》2018年第7期）、《沈周〈庐墓图〉与茔域山水画》（《文艺研究》2018年第11期）、《沈周〈沧洲趣图〉的意涵、年代及接受者》（《美术》2019年第6…</span>

                              <span>Hey HN, I didn&#x27;t want my Gateway 4DX2-66 from 1993 to be left out of the AI revolution, so I built an AI Assistant for Windows 3.1, based on the OpenAI API.
The most interesting parts of building this were:
- Getting TLS 1.2 and 1.3 working on Windows 3.1 so that WinGPT could directly connect to OpenAI&#x27;s server without relying on a modern machine for TLS termination.
- Learning about the memory segmentation architecture on 16-bit Windows, including the difference between far and near pointers.
- Building the UI in plain C code with the Windows API and limited selection of controls in Windows 3.1.
You can check it out here and learn more about what it was like to build it: https://www.dialup.net/wingpt/

                              <span>Hi HN, I recently created and published an open-source resume builder as a weekend project. The idea came to me while I was mentoring students and noticing common mistakes they made in their resumes that I had also made in the past. I thought to build a tool to help people easily create a modern professional resume with built-in best practices to avoid those mistakes.
Top highlights of the resume builder are:
1. Real time UI update as you type
2. ATS friendly to top ATS platforms, e.g. Greenhouse, Lever
3. Privacy focus - no sign up is required and data is stored locally in browser that only users have access
4. Support import from existing resume PDF
The tool also includes a resume parser to help people test their existing resumes’ ATS readability if they might not be interested in using the builder. I also explained the parser algorithm in an article with interactive tables that might be an interesting read to see the steps and logics it uses (https://www.open-resume.com/resume-parser).
I hope others might find this tool useful and I look forward to hearing any feedback the community has. Thanks all.

                              <span>When watching a live stream on youtube you can watch current events, or rewind to the past to watch what has happened 1,5 hour ago.
 I want to setup a home monitoring service. I want a similar service, for myself, on my own server with public IP. I know Linux. I have a raspberrypi connected to network that I want to stream video from home to my server.
 I looked into &quot;restreamer&quot;, but I think it streams a stream to other services only and has no history. Right now, I try to setup &quot;avideo&quot; (or &quot;youphptube&quot;) inside ubuntu docker container with mixed success.
 Is there an application to allow presenting a video stream via a web page (or anything else that will work on android) with the functionality of rewinding to the past and recording everything to a directory?
 If I understand, when I set up nginx with rtmp it can stream the stream. And the stream is recorded to a directory. But to watch &quot;what has happened 2 hours ago&quot; I have to open the directory where the stream is recorded and download a file and watch it. I want it to work like youtube. Just click 2 hours ago on the video. How do I do that?
 Thanks.

                              <span>Hello,
 I&#x27;m having a bit of an issue with Plymouth. I&#x27;m running the code below for a theme, however scaling the images seem to make the whole script lag really bad. 
 There isn&#x27;t much documentation available so I&#x27;m not sure what I&#x27;m doing wrong or why scaling these images would make it lag. As I understand it it only scales them once per image then is plays them but maybe I&#x27;m wrong, I don&#x27;t know. 
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 Window.SetBackgroundTopColor(0.234, 0.43, 0.705); Window.SetBackgroundBottomColor(0.16, 0.25, 0.44);
 window_width &#x3D; Window.GetWidth(); window_height &#x3D; Window.GetHeight();
 intro_index &#x3D; 0; load_index &#x3D; 0; max_intro &#x3D; 37; max_load &#x3D; 20;
 index &#x3D; 0; while (1){ intro[index] &#x3D; Image(&quot;IntroAnim&quot; + index + &quot;.png&quot;); intro[index].Scale(window_width, window_height); if (index &gt; max_intro) break; index++; }
 index &#x3D; 0; while (1){ load[index] &#x3D; Image(&quot;LoadAnim&quot; + index + &quot;.png&quot;); load[index].Scale(window_width, window_height); if (index &gt; max_load) break; index++; }
 sprite &#x3D; Sprite();
 fun refresh (){ if (intro_index  max_intro) { sprite.SetImage(load[load_index]); } intro_index++; load_index &#x3D; (load_index + 1) % max_load; }
 Plymouth.SetRefreshFunction (refresh);

                              <span>Watching a movie, sound stutters once in a while for about 1 or 2 seconds. Not often, maybe once every 2 hours.
 Logging in using sddm or any other DM, both monitors flicker for maybe half a second.
 Starting an application from the launcher, nothing happens. Switch to terminal to see what&#x27;s up. Solved in a couple of google searches. 
 And some more little tiny annoyances.
 It&#x27;s nothing, basically. I love Linux, everything works. But the experience just isn&#x27;t smooth. Everything &quot;works&quot;. 
 Will those annoyances go away if I use Debian or OpenSUSE Leap? Maybe you can tell. To me there&#x27;s always some thing I have to fix. Maybe that&#x27;s why I love Linux.

 going back to try and get my pc to suspend after idle for 10 minutes.

                              <span>I am not affilitated with Canonical and I don&#x27;t have a love with snaps. I just want applications that work.
 Let&#x27;s be honest, one of the most common complaints i see about snaps other than load times are the fact that there&#x27;s only one repository to pull packages from. And that&#x27;s more than often commonly listed as the sole reason why flatpaks are &quot;apparently&quot; better.
 So why is it that flathub is the only repo that&#x27;s list in every distro&#x27;s documentation to enable? ArchwikiDebianGentoo
 In fact, it&#x27;s also the only repo I see that has applications added to it. here&#x27;s the breakdown on numbers. First here&#x27;s how to find this pout yourself so lets enable the big three repo&#x27;s that I&#x27;ve come across from stalking /r/flatpak

                              <span>I am obviously not a lawyer so that is why I am asking this question. According to Wikipedia distros like EuroLinux are opposed to the idea of software patens which makes me think that they would also be against the idea of RedHat legally bending the GPL (at least in the US) though a license agreement in their favour.

 I&#x27;ve been looking for about a week in researching this, running a multitude of config files, commands &amp; installing programs that was recommended by other users on wiks/forums.
 I&#x27;ve reinstalled so many times after just messing up the audio system and it would never boot or hear any audio.
 Tired Pulsewave, pipewire doing different configs, no dice.
 Is there anyone out there who have similar setup or the knowhow to this, Can you assist please :)

                              <span>Imagine my surprise when I go to draft a bug report with the coredump that has been elusively evading me for a few weeks and I open the bug triage page to get my report right, I open it to see this:
 There are thousands of lines of this
 Perhaps this is the wrong place for it but r/KDE is currently in blackout. Also maybe defaced is a better word apologies if it’s too click baity.
 EDIT: Appears here as well, others from a group I am in are saying it is the whole site. Quite unfortunate someone has to make things harder for the people doing god&#x27;s work. If anyone needs the info, the wayback machine appears to have everything necessary.

                              <span>I love linux and love helping people using it. All of Reddit is changing, and of course there are going to be pros and cons out of this mods-sponsored anarchy :)
 But I&#x27;ve seen in the past few days, the &quot;my kali VM won&#x27;t scan the neighbor wifi&quot; and &quot;xyz game won&#x27;t start&quot; kind of post are incoming, fast.
 I mostly ignore them, unless there is something to share that may help someone else.Please note, this is not a &quot;problem&quot;, I&#x27;d just like to hear some opinions. 
 Edit: 
 as u/abbidabbi pointed out:
  
The automoderator bot has been deactivated. Reporting is useless, so it&#x27;s basically the same as clicking the hide button.

安全专家发现，数以百万计的 GitHub 项目易受依赖库劫持攻击，攻击者可以借此发动影响大量用户的供应链攻击。GitHub 上的用户名和项目或库的名字如果改变，为了避免破坏其它项目的依赖关系，GitHub 会创建一个重定向。但如果有人用旧的名字创建了账号，那么就会导致重定向无效。GitHub 可以防御部分此类攻击，但该防御方案可以被绕过。

老王点评：我觉得 GitHub 应该更认真的解决这个问题，毕竟 GitHub 已经不仅仅是一个代码仓库，而是一个供应链的重要组成部分了。但从另外一个角度看，软件项目依赖这种不确定的供应链是不是也过于宽松了？




美国新数据显示，在家工作成为新常态

许多在大流行期间蜷缩在家里的白领工人已经回到办公室，但没有回到办公室的人特别多。对许多人来说，远程工作似乎是一种新常态。周四公布的美国经济数据显示，在家工作似乎已经成为一种趋势，特别是对女性和受过大学教育的人而言。2022 年的数据显示，34% 的 15 岁以上的人仍然在家里工作，54% 的人拥有学士或更高的学位。而美国旧金山市长已经 提议 将市中心荒废的购物中心改造为足球场，因为越来越多人不再回到市中心上班，旧金山的办公室空置率已达到 30 年来的最高水平。

Firewalld 2.0 发布

开源防火墙守护程序 Firewalld 自 2011 年以来一直在开发，而两年前才达到 Firewalld 1.0 的里程碑。因此，发现 Firewalld 2.0 在今天发布有点令人惊讶。2.0 中最重要的变化解决了区域漂移的问题，即防火墙策略可能最终违反了 “数据包只进入一个区域” 的规则。此外，还增加了对 NFTables Flowtable 的支持，可以显著提高转发性能，将网络转发的 iperf 性能提高了约 59%。

老王点评：看起来是 Firewalld 的开发在加速，不过我更觉得它是在飙版本号。看看 Firefox、Linux 内核等开源软件的版本号，看来开源软件对版本号的谦虚传统已经被丢弃了。</span>

                              <span>在本文中，我们将逐步向你展示如何在 Kubernetes（k8s）集群上安装 Ansible AWX。


Ansible AWX 是一个强大的开源工具，用于管理和自动化 IT 基础设施。AWX 为 Ansible 提供图形用户界面，使你可以轻松创建、安排和运行 Ansible 剧本Playbook。

另一方面，Kubernetes 是一种流行的容器编排平台，广泛用于部署和管理容器化应用。

先决条件：


Kubernetes 集群

Kubectl

具有 sudo 权限和集群管理员权限的普通用户

互联网连接


步骤 1：安装 Helm

如果你的系统上安装了 Helm，则在命令下运行以进行安装，

$ curl -fsSL -o get_helm.sh https://raw.githubusercontent.com/helm/helm/main/scripts/get-helm-3
$ chmod +x get_helm.sh
$ ./get_helm.sh
$ helm version




步骤 2：安装 AWX chart

在 Kubernetes 上安装 AWX 的最简单方法是使用 AWX Helm “海图chart”。因此，要通过 “海图” 安装 AWX，首先使用以下 helm 命令添加仓库。（LCTT 译注：Kubernetes 生态中大量使用了和航海有关的比喻，因此本文在翻译时也采用了这些比喻）

$ helm repo add awx-operator https://ansible.github.io/awx-operator/
&quot;awx-operator&quot; has been added to your repositories
$


注意：如果你之前已经添加过此仓库，请在命令下运行以…</span>

加布里埃尔·伊根（Gabriel Egan）先生是英国德蒙福特大学教授、国际知名莎学专家，也是《新版牛津莎士比亚全集》的四位总编辑之一。《全集》前四卷已出版，分别是《现代评论版》《研究参考版》（两卷）和《作者身份溯源》；后两卷是《剧目别本》，将在2023-2024年出版。杨英军先生应《上海书评》之邀，借莎翁第一对开本出版四百年之机采访了伊根教授，请他谈了《新版牛津莎士比亚全集》的编纂及莎学研究的最新进展。

伊根：《新版牛津莎士比亚全集》（以下简称《全集》）是国际莎学同行协力合作的项目，担任总编辑的还有佛罗里达州立大学的加里·泰勒（Gary Taylor）教授，伯明翰大学的约翰·乔维特（John Jowett）教授，印第安纳大学的特里·柏鲁斯（Terri Bourus）教授。

                              <span>So I&#x27;m curently using Windows 7, don&#x27;t care, it&#x27;s fine, it runs everything I want and need, I don&#x27;t keep any data I need go keep private about on my PC. The only problem is Steam dropping support for Windows 7.
 And I&#x27;m not switching to the garbage that is Windows 10, and especially not Windows 10 the sequel, aka 11.
 The problem why I never used Linux for gaming, is that most of my ancient games from the 90s, early 2000s just won&#x27;t run on any Linux distro I tried. To be fair most of them barely run on Windows 7 but I can make it work with some fiddling. And I want my new rig to run everything, so I don&#x27;t need two seperate PCs for running different eras of games.
 But that was years ago when I last tried it, maybe there are some improvements made to run old Windows software? Plus points if a distro has a super outdated UI and looks ancient.

                              <span>Here is a video: https://youtu.be/cyWu_pHwqNg
 InkBox OS is a fully-functional operating system for some Kobo and Kindle eReader devices. It has pretty much been built from scratch, except for the base system which consists of Alpine Linux 3.10 (the reason why we use such an old version is because not all devices run a recent enough kernel to handle libc that weren&#x27;t built for them). Most of the scripts, system initialization and graphical user interface programs were written from the ground up, though.
 I hope that you will enjoy it if you are able to try it!

                              <span>Working from a personal PC has the downside of being responsible for its availability, regardless of what happens, as well as ensuring its safety against any invasion. Currently, my approach is as follows:
 ​
  
Having a Linux PC for work.
 
Using separate email accounts for different purposes.
 
Using secure passwords for each account.
 
Using one browser for confidential tasks and another for non-confidential tasks.
 
Avoiding logging in with confidential emails on unsafe devices.
 
Never saving or copying passwords.
 
Not sharing the number used for two-step authentication with work colleagues.
 
Providing fake personal information on each email account, such as a mother&#x27;s name.
 
Avoiding the installation of unknown repositories, programs, or scripts.
 
 ​
 That covers the safety aspect.
 ​
 To ensure reliability, I always keep an external HD on hand that I can quickly use for work in case anything goes wrong with my work PC.
 ​
 I&#x27;m considering what else I could do. I&#x27;ve heard that password management apps are very secure, and some even offer two-step authentication. Additionally, syncing a folder to Google Drive might be the best way to ensure uninterrupted access to important data, regardless of any issues. However, I&#x27;m unsure if encrypting the HD has any downsides, such as decreased read/write speed or the risk of data loss due to errors.
 ​
 Ideally, for a reliable and safe scenario, it would be convenient to have all data saved in the cloud without the associated risks.
 ​
 What are your thoughts?

                              <span>So, I&#x27;m working on making an boot image file for a device that uses Linux as a base OS, not sure what base distro, but for the majority of its system graphic files, it uses .bmp.gz files. Now, I already have my boot image file itself (640x480 24-bit color-depth bitmap) that&#x27;s 901 KB in size. The trouble is, when I download a boot image from a community site that serves themes and boot logos, the boot logos are like 21 KB in size (that inflate to 901 KB .BMPs), and the default boot logo is deflated to a scant 10 KB! And it, too, inflates to 901 KB. When I use gzip to compress my file, I use the -v9k flag and only manage 84.1%, resulting in a compressed filesize of 144 KB. Is there anything I can do to increase compression?

                              <span>Greetings, penguins. Got a question. So recently I had dual-boot Kali with Windows. After some failed usage of Kali I found out in web that Kali is not the best for desktop (better use with live boot). Then I transferred to Arch Linux, again dual-boot with Windows. But Arch wasn&#x27;t so user friendly as I&#x27;ve expected. Instead of working for myself I was working to fix Arch. Now I have only Windows, but I want to use Linux as well, again with dual-boot. :)
 The question is what Linux distro would you recommend for dual-boot? I want something to help me understand how Linux works ( not ones that are 99% like Windows and etc. ) and if possible suitable for gaming. Thank you in advance!! :) 
 P. S. 
 If you&#x27;re wondering why in the world I still want to use Windows the answer is Lenovo Vantage. My laptop is Lenovo Legion 5 pro and that app helps me to configure everything on my laptop, especially GPU Mode (Hybrid mode, dGPU mode, etc. ).

                              <span>I researched everything (literally) for days to find how to disable RST on HP (my version is HP Pavillion x360) and the answer everywhere was - There is no solution.
 I wonder if anyone has some kind of workaround or will the solution be implemented in some future updates? I saw that there are a lot of HP people that can&#x27;t use Linux because of this and I think that is a big miss for everyone.
 I am grateful for every answer!

                              <span>From time to time I&#x27;m thinking about ditching my smartphone and using my laptop with arch for everything. The most important thing for traveling and getting around seems to be navigation. I would love to use my thinkpad on a car mount for it. 
 Does anyone know any good Software? Seems like all software I can find is kinda prehistoric.

                              <span>I&#x27;ve been using Linux since 2017 as my main OS until my old laptop stopped working last year and I had to buy another one. My choice was the Galaxy Book S - but my nightmare started when I arrived home and tried to install Ubuntu on it. For some reason, the installer couldn&#x27;t recognize any disk, and the same issue appeared over and over, no matter which distro I tried to use. 
 After some research I found out that this model does not use a regular SSD, but an eUFS instead (I&#x27;ve never heard about it before, apparently it is often used within smartphones). Since then, I&#x27;m stuck in Windows. Ubuntu sometimes recognizes it but it&#x27;s never able to finish installation, the disk always disappears before it.
 Does anyone have any idea of how to solve it? I&#x27;ve been thinking in some way to install just a &quot;windows-skeleton-alike&quot; with no visual system, just code, and install a virtual machine with Ubuntu above it, but I&#x27;m not sure if this is even a possibility.
 I do not like using Windows at all, and I don&#x27;t know what to do anymore. Unfortunately selling it and buying another is not an option at the moment.

                              <span>人工智能工件需要新的开源许可证

上世纪七八十年代，由于自由软件运动的兴起，从版权法中衍生出来了自由及开源软件许可证，护航了自由及开源软件的蓬勃发展。人工智能诞生于开源软件，像 TensorFlow、PyTorch 这样的人工智能程序在其开源许可下运行良好。但新的人工智能工件，如数据集、模型、权重等并不完全适用于传统的版权模式。就像对 GitHub Copilot 输出的代码建议的起诉案，相信对用于训练人工智能违例使用各种训练素材的起诉会越来越多。甚至，会有像专利巨魔一样的许可证巨魔出现。开源倡议（OSI）和许多开源和人工智能领导人正在努力将人工智能和开源许可证以对两者都有意义的方式结合起来。


消息来源：The Register



老王点评：人工智能崛起的太快，一年前还没什么人谈论人工智能，以至于很多事情都来不及做好准备。所以，现在需要一个像当年的自由软件宣言一样的提纲挈领的倡议出现，以及在这个基础上建立的不同的许可证，才能真正为人工智能的发展铺平道路。




安卓的紧急呼叫打爆英国 999 紧急电话

安卓 12 系统为紧急服务增加了一个简单的功能：只要连按五次电源键，你的手机就会为你拨打紧急服务。当手机放在你的口袋里，或者你有一个不正常的电源按钮时，这显然很容易意外地做到。英国警方称，“所有紧急服务机构目前都在经历创纪录的 999 电话量”。有趣的是，带有这个功能的安卓 12 是在一年半前推出的，但直到现在才逐步普及到足够多的设备上。从那时起，就有源源不断的帖子提醒人们注意这个问题。在补丁出来之前，谷歌目前的建议是关闭该功能。

新车质量因使用更多新技术而下降

据研究，在美国销售的新车的质量正在下降，因为越来越多地使用了新技术和某些零件的制造质量下降等因素使这些车型更有“问题”。报告说，在过去两年中，每 100 辆车的问题数（PP100）上升了 30。特斯拉的 PP100 质量评级，同比增加了 31，到 2023 年达到了 257。新车提供的电子触摸式设计的门把手也成为了一个问题，在 10 个问题最多的车型中，有 7 个是电池电动车。


消息来源：路透社



老王点评：电动车是有很多先进的地方，但是堆砌不成熟的新技术往往是造成崩溃的原因。这有点像一个刚刚学会使用新框架的开发者，喜欢利用各种新功能来开发软件，但是往往出现一些问题。</span>

                              <span>这篇初学者指南解释了在 Ubuntu、Linux Mint 和 Windows 中升级到最新 LibreOffice 所需的步骤。




LibreOffice 被全球数百万用户使用，是当今最流行的免费办公套件。它由电子表格程序 （Calc）、文档处理器（Writer）、演示文稿（Impress）、绘图（Draw）和数学模块组成，可帮助你完成大部分办公、商务、学术和日常工作。

由于与 DOCX、PPTX 和 XLSX 等专有文件格式兼容，LibreOffice 可以作为付费的微软 Office 套件的出色替代品。它是 Apache OpenOffice 生产力套件的一个分支，由数以千计的全球贡献者积极开发。



升级到最新的 LibreOffice

LibreOffice 改变了它的版本命名方式，不再采用&quot;Fresh&quot;和&quot;Still&quot;的概念。现在，LibreOffice 有一个社区版和一个推荐的企业版。这是因为许多企业使用带有最新功能的最新 LibreOffice 版本，这对开发工作造成了阻碍。因此，团队建议企业用户从 LibreOffice 官方合作伙伴那里获得付费支持，以获得长期支持。你可以在 此处 阅读博文。

以下是当前的版本：

最新的 LibreOffice 版本


当前的 LibreOffice 社区版本系列是 LibreOffice 7.4.x。

LibreOffice 稳定推荐的商业版本是 LibreOffice 7.3.x。


在 Ubuntu、Linux Mint 和其他基于 Ubuntu 的发行版中升级到最新的 LibreOffice

Ubuntu 22.04 LTS Jammy Jellyfish 具有 LibreOffice 7.3.x。

                              <span>《线的文化史》，[英]蒂姆·英戈尔德著，张晓佳译，明室Lucida｜北京联合出版社，2023年5月出版，288页，62.00元

日本科幻小说家伴名练的短篇小说《平滑世界和它的敌人》（收于《平滑世界和它的敌人》，丁丁虫译，译林出版社，2022年）讲述了一个有趣的故事：作品设定人类开发出一种名为“乘觉”的第六感，可以自由穿梭于平行时空当中，这样一来世界就变得无比“平滑”——无论在何时何地遇到问题，人只要调动“乘觉”前往新的时空，问题便可迎刃而解。
然而就是这样一个“美丽新世界”，却依然有它的敌人。有人开发出一种可以屏蔽“乘觉”的药物，结果一场意外事故让一名制药厂员工不慎失去了“乘觉”，这名员工出于报复心理，试图向社会投放这种药物。故事接下来的走向乍看出人意料，却又在情理之中——当人的所有经验都可以自由索取、无限重来，“一生一次”的体验反而变得弥足珍贵、令人心仪。
从某种意义上，我们这个世界虽然还做不到“来去自由”，但它的确是在向“平滑化”迈进。今天的人们足不出户便能接收全球资讯，轻点鼠标即可与世界另一端的人“实时互联”，更不必说种种方兴未艾的“虚拟现实”（VR）和“增强现实”（AR）技术，其实就是在为人类提供自由穿梭于平行时空的可能。然而这种“平滑”也滋生了诸多问题，譬如它的脆弱性——我们几乎无法忍受自己或是他者“不在线”或是“掉线”；再如当现实世界被置换为“屏幕世界”，“避开现实而紧盯屏幕已经成为现状。屏幕训练我们去顺应和满足现状，而我们已经开始接受这种现状并取其精华、去其糟粕”（[荷兰]诺伦·格尔茨：《虚无主义》，张红军译，商务印书馆，123页）。
基于这样的前提，英国人类学家蒂姆·英戈尔德的这部《线的文化史》今天读来格外有趣。由人类的制线行为（line-making）入手，英戈尔德考察了“线”作为一种现象，在人类实践中的存在及其演变。在他看来，作为主体的“实线”曾经是人…</span>

                              <span>Many JS libraries exist to build graphs on the web (Vega, chartJS, Plotly...).
They allow to make charts quickly. 
But you lose flexibility: you&#x27;re limited by the options they offer.
I just created a gallery with hundreds of graphs made with d3.js and React. 
- Examples are split by graph types
- They all come with explanation and code sandboxes
- Gradual complexity to ease the learning curve
It took me ages to create this project! Feedback welcome!

                              <span>I mean Trilium is fantastic app, lots of potential but the developer is struggling on his own, maybe it&#x27;s because it&#x27;s younger than logseq or maybe because is open source compared to obsidian. I think it&#x27;s the best note-taking/knowledge-base/second-brain i know it virtually could link everything you posses toghter to create a gigantic wiki, so much potential. Plus it has its own self hostable syncing server and web app. Guys give it a look and tell me what you think

 I do understand that some in the usual places are not available any longer - e.g. r/linuxquestions is locked, but please if you need support, either head to your distro channels on Reddit or elsewhere or post on support subs like r/linux4noobs.

                              <span>Running Debian 12, the initial impression of Wayland is good. But once you start installing other software, you run into problems which do not exist in X11: you can&#x27;t watch hardware accelerated videos on Chromium and derived browsers (massive shoutout to firefox for being there), various GNOME extensions will freeze up the system (ex. Pixel saver), adwaita themes will mess up (light theme on one app, dark on another) to name a few.
 Wayland still have a long way to go , till then, X11 remains the only option if you don&#x27;t want to walk on egg shells.

This code is part of the Linux INET6 implementation and is responsible for the IPv6 Address auto configuration (https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v6.2.11/source/net/ipv6/addrconf.c#L3).
 Overall, each IPv6 entity in the network needs a globally unique address for communicating outside of the local segment. In order to get such an address there are a few options: manual assignment of an address, DHCPv6 (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol version 6) and SLAAC (Stateless Address Autoconfiguration). When talking about stateless and stateful it means if there is a server/device that keep tracks of a state for each address assignment (https://www.networkac…</span>

Now they also have the option to use Project78 from Linux Belgium which offers a Cloud and OnPrem version to aid in the transition to RHEL 8 or Rocky Linux 8.

                              <span>Hi all, 
 I have a microcontroller board on which I am opening up an MMS port. I set the board on a static IP (this is required) and I am trying to see what data I am getting on the IEDExplorer tool which works on MMS protocol.
 Now, if the system that runs the IEDExplorer tool is on a static IP of the same range (10.3.11.x) then it works, but if the system is on a dynamic IP of the range 172.x.x.x, I can ping the board but I don&#x27;t see any data on the tool.
 The application that I am using is correct because it has been previously on a different Linux image and a different processor. 
 The only thing that I am suspecting is that something might be wrong with the Linux image I have built using yocto and if something can be changed about it. 
 Feel free to ask more details and I would be really glad if you can help me out as I don&#x27;t see any solution at all. (Firewall is allowing all the traffic and there is no proxy)
 ​
 Thanks.

                              <span>I have looked it on Internet but the result confused me because it says that CPU is x86 but it also supports 64bit, hence I don’t know should I get the 32bit or 64bit version of Linux? And What distro do you guys suggest? 
 That CPU is on my Acer Aspire One D255E with only 1GB of Ram, then should I go with LXDE or LXQT? 
 I just want to do very basic tasks like watching YouTube with Blocked Ads add-on browser and simple office works (presentation and finance sheets too), of course music and video offline playing *.mp3 and *.mp4, that’s all.
 Thanks in advanced!

                              <span>Chromium-based browsers support File Systeam Access API.
 We can request permission to create, write to, read and remove directories and files in the local filesystem.
 If we start a shell script that watches for file creation, modification, and writes we can execute that file, write output to a different local file then read that file in the browser.
 This provides us a means to achieve requirements in the browser that the browser does not support, e.g., passing SSML (Speech Synthesis Markup Language) to and capturing audio output of Web Speech API&#x27;s window.speechSynthesis.speak().
 Something like this using GNU Core Utilities tail

                              <span>So I&#x27;ve had a Lenovo Yoga 2 pro (2013) that I&#x27;ve had Ubuntu and mint on previously installed. It came with windows 8, but it has issues related to windows 10 so I tried Linux. Both mint and Ubuntu worked initially for awhile, but eventually both hit a point where the track pad stops responding until I do a full reinstall. I also noticed that the fans seemed to run higher more often than windows. I&#x27;m curious if another distro would fix these problems or if it just isn&#x27;t going to work. 
 I&#x27;d use it mainly for hobby programming/browsing, and to learning Linux more. If it&#x27;s futile also looking for laptop suggestions for replacements in the future.

I found a way to disable the title bar on windows using the win32 api and it works perfectly. I’m now trying to do the same thing on linux while still been able to resize the window and rounded corners.
 I can already get the window and the display with 
 Display* display &#x3D; glfwGetX11Display(); Window x11Window &#x3D; glfwGetX11Window(window);
 Any help would be appreciated :)

 Alternative but more accurate title. Hackers installed software and did bad stuff on already compromised systems running a shitty and obscure Linux derivative used for crypto bro mining. It is unclear how they even got access.
 In other news, Microsoft Azure, outlook 365, and Azure SQL server have all been hacked and lost customer data in the past year.

                              <span>Over on the Software Freedom Conservancy blog, Policy Fellow and Hacker-in-Residence Bradley M. Kuhn analyzes the recent changes to Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) source availability in light of the GPL.  It contains some interesting information about two alleged GPL violations that came about because the company&#x27;s business model is structured in a way that brings it too close to non-compliance with the license, he said:

Perhaps the biggest problem with a murky business model that skirts the line of GPL compliance is that violations can and do happen — since even a minor deviation from the business model clearly violates the GPL agreements. Pre-IBM Red Hat deserves a certain amount of credit, as SFC is aware of only two documented incidents of GPL violations that have occurred since 2006 regarding the RHEL business model. We&#x27;ve decided to share some general details of these violations for the purpose of explaining where this business model can so easily cross the line.

[...] In another violation incident, we learned that Red Hat, in a specific non-USA country, was requiring that any customer who lowered the number of RHEL machines under service contract with Red Hat sign an additional agreement. This additional agreement promised that the customer had deleted every copy of RHEL in their entire organization other than the copies of RHEL that were currently contracted for service with Red Hat. Again, this is a &quot;further restriction&quot;. The GPL agreements give everyone the unfettered right to make and keep as many copies of the software as they like, and a distributor of GPL&#x27;d software may not require a user to attest that they&#x27;ve deleted these legitimate, licensed copies of third-party-licensed software under the GPL. SFC informed Red Hat&#x27;s legal department of this violation, and we were assured that this additional agreement would no longer be presented to any Red Hat customers in the future.</span>

Luis Chamberlain (he also led a plenary on

kthread-freezer-removal effort.  The kthread freezer is meant to help
filesystems freeze their state in order to
suspend or hibernate the system, but since at least 2015, the freezer has been targeted for removal.  Things
did not change much a year later, nor by 
LSFMM in 2018 when Chamberlain had picked up Jiri Kosina&#x27;s removal
effort; this year, Chamberlain was back to try to push things along.</span>

                              <span>《华尔街日报》6月23日消息，Facebook母公司Meta周四表示，在加拿大议会通过一项迫使互联网巨头向新闻出版商付费的法案后，将终止在加拿大的Facebook和Instagram上提供新闻。


加拿大参议院周四批准了《在线新闻法案》（Online News Act），预计不久将正式通过。Meta在声明中说：“今天，我们确认，在《在线新闻法》生效之前，加拿大所有用户将无法在Facebook和Instagram上获取新闻。”


报道指出，加拿大“在线新闻法案”要求脸书和谷歌等互联网巨头付费使用当地媒体的新闻内容，这意味着加拿大成为继澳大利亚后第二个立法要求互联网公司为使用当地媒体新闻内容付费的国家。澳大利亚于 2021 年通过“新闻媒体与数字平台强制议价法案”。


谷歌对此抗议称，加拿大法律比澳大利亚更加严格，希望加拿大修改立法。多家美国互联网公司也表态称，这些立法对他们的业务造成了影响。


加拿大内阁领导人特鲁多谴责称，Meta 和谷歌在反抗这个法案时，用了“霸凌的手段”。法案的主要起草人、加拿大文化遗产部长 Pablo Rodriguez 也在声明中强调，这是加拿大民众对抗科技巨头的第一步。

                        <a class="article-summary-link article-summary-box-outer" href="https://www.williamlong.info/archives/7205.html">
                          <div class="article-summary-box-inner media-object">

                              <span>美国联邦贸易委员会(FTC)将于周四在联邦法庭上提出初步禁令，以暂时阻止微软690亿美元（备注：当前约4954.2亿元人民币）收购动视暴雪(Activision Blizzard)。他们认为在政府作出裁决之前应该先停止交易。


微软曾表示，“临时阻止”可能会破坏这笔交易，但法院通常不会考虑这种现实后果。如果法院暂停这笔交易，微软和动视暴雪就得将其原定于7月18日终止的协议延后。


在旧金山一家联邦法官预定为期五天的听证会上，反垄断执法机构将辩称，它需要让微软公司和动视暴雪公司在联邦法院就合并案作出裁决之前暂缓该交易，因为该机构的内部法院尚未就该交易是否损害了游戏行业的竞争状况作出裁决。


FTC担心，如果没有联邦法院采取行动，两家公司的合并“可能会改变动视暴雪的运营和商业计划”，并且可能导致微软获取敏感的企业信息。


据悉，FTC内部的行政听证会定于8月2日开始，而解决美国FTC的诉讼是微软和动视暴雪在全球范围内争取完成这笔交易的关键反垄断战之一。


FTC认为，这笔交易将是微软有史以来最大的一笔交易，也是游戏业务史上最大的一笔交易。它将使微软拥有“削弱或降低动视暴雪内容的能力和动机”，从而实质性地减少竞争。


此外，FTC曾在12月份要求其内部行政法庭阻止这笔交易，并表示该合并将使微软的Xbox游戏机独占动视暴雪游戏，而任天堂和索尼会被排除在外。


微软曾表示，这笔交易将有利于游戏玩家和游戏公司双方的利益，并已向FTC提出签署具有法律约束力的同意书，承诺在未来十年内向包括索尼在内的竞争对手提供“使命召唤”游戏。


听证会将于6月22日开始，持续到6月29日。微软首席执行官萨蒂亚・纳德拉(Satya Nadella)和动视暴雪首席执行官鲍比・科迪克(Bobby Kotick)等高管都将作为证人出庭作证。

                              <span>像 fzf 和 fzy 这样的现代工具将 Linux 终端中的文件搜索提升到了一个新的水平。


在 Linux 命令行中，如何 搜索文件？你可以使用 find 命令。这是标准答案，没有问题。

通常，你键入带有搜索参数的命令，按回车键，然后它会显示搜索结果。

你可以通过模糊搜索来提升终端中的文件搜索体验。

模糊搜索是一种近似搜索算法或技术。在这种搜索中，通过名称搜索指定位置的文件，并实时显示结果给用户。

模糊搜索在网络搜索引擎中很受欢迎，用户开始输入术语后，它会开始显示与该术语相关的结果。

在本文中，我将讨论两个命令行工具，它们可以让你在 Linux 中执行模糊搜索：


fzf：模糊查找工具

fzy：模糊选择工具


fzf：Linux 中的模糊查找工具

fzf 是一款可用于 Linux 的模糊搜索工具，你可以通过它进行交互式文件搜索。

在 Ubuntu 中安装 fzf，打开终端并运行以下命令：

sudo apt install fzf


虽然 fzf 本身可以正常工作，但最好与其他工具配合使用，以充分发挥其功能。

使用 fzf

打开终端并运行：

fzf


这将打开一个 fzf 提示符，在当前工作目录中搜索文件。



为 fzf 应用边框

你可以使用 --border 选项为 fzf 应用边框，有多种边框可用，如 rounded（圆角）、sharp（尖角）等。

fzf --border&#x3D;rounded




应用背景和前景颜色

使用颜色属性，你可以为 fzf 设置 ANSI 颜色，可以作为背景、前景或两者都设置。



fzf --color&#x3D;&quot;bg:black,fg:yellow&quot;


你可以串联这些选项，使 fzf 在视觉上更加美观。

针对 昨天 红帽发布的改变 RHEL 源代码发布方式的公告，AlmaLinux 发布声明称，这将限制他们 1:1 复制 RHEL 构建的能力。因为 CentOS Stream 虽然是 RHEL 的上游，但并不总是包括 RHEL 软件包中的所有补丁和更新。想要做到完全复制，需要有 RHEL 构建版本时的源代码。而要获得该源代码，AlmaLinux 称，“不幸的是，按照我们今天的理解，红帽公司的用户界面协议表明，重新发布通过客户门户获得的资源将违反这些协议。”在短期内，他们将专注于通过跟踪 CentOS Stream 的变化和 Oracle Linux 等来为 AlmaLinux 提供安全更新。但从长远来看，他们将与其他 RHEL 下游产品和合作伙伴合作，寻找一条合适的发展道路。


消息来源：AlmaLinux



老王点评：对于这件事红帽背后的动机我们就不妄自揣测了，毕竟红帽和 AlmaLinux 曾经“建立了令人难以置信的工作关系”。但事实就是，社区构建的 AlmaLinux 想要跟上 RHEL 的构建会越来越麻烦和越来越慢。所以，你怎么看呢？




哈佛给计算机学生们配备了一位聊天机器人老师

哈佛大学将为今年秋季的计算机科学导论 CS50 课程的学生配置一位聊天机器人老师。这个聊天机器人将不使用 ChatGPT 或 GitHub Copilot，因为它们“太有帮助了”。相反，哈佛大学已经开发了自己的大型语言模型 “CS50 机器人”，它将 “具有类似的精神”，但将专注于 “引导学生找到答案，而不是将答案交给他们”。

老王点评：我认为哈佛大学走在了正确的道路，拥抱 AI，而不是让 AI 替代人类，让 AI 帮助学习，而不是让学生抄袭 AI 的作业。




E3 或许再也不会举办

之前，我们 报道 过，今年的 E3 2023 已经取消，这本应是 2019 年后的第一次 E3 线下盛会。现在，E3 已经取消了 2024 年和 2025 年在洛杉矶的活动。这表明有些事情阻碍了 E3 的回归，或者其组织者正在考虑将其迁出洛杉矶。

在 Rust 基础系列的最后一章里，让我们现在用 Rust 编写一个程序，使用这些主题，以便更好地理解它们在现实世界中的用途。让我们来编写一个相对简单的程序，用来从水果市场订购水果。

我们程序的基本结构

来让我们首先向用户问好，并告诉他们如何与程序交互。

fn main() {
    println!(&quot;欢迎来到水果市场！&quot;);
    println!(&quot;请选择要购买的水果。\n&quot;);

    println!(&quot;\n可以购买的水果：苹果、香蕉、橘子、芒果、葡萄&quot;);
    println!(&quot;购买完成后，请输入“quit”或“q”。\n&quot;);
}


获取用户输入

上面的代码非常简单。目前，你不知道接下来该做什么，因为你不知道用户接下来想做什么。

所以让我们添加一些代码，接受用户输入并将其存储在某个地方以便稍后解析，然后根据用户输入采取适当的操作。

use std::io;

fn main() {
    println!(&quot;欢迎来到水果市场！&quot;);
    println!(&quot;请选择要购买的水果。\n&quot;);

    println!(&quot;\n可以购买的水果：苹果、香蕉、橘子、芒果、葡萄&quot;);
    println!(&quot;购买完成后，请输入“quit”或“q”。\n&quot;);

    // 获取用户输入
    let mut user_input &#x3D; String::new();
    io::stdin()
        .read_line(&amp;mut user_input)
        .expect(&quot;无法读取用户输入。&quot;);
}

可能让你惊讶的是，LXDE 和 LXQT 桌面环境都是基于 Openbox 构建的。你甚至可以用它替换桌面环境的窗口管理器。

当然，你几乎可以在任何 Linux 发行版上安装 Openbox。不过，配置它需要时间和精力。

一个更简单的方法是使用提供 Openbox 变种的发行版。在本文中，我列出了一些能够让你轻松体验 Openbox 的发行版。

注意： 列表按字母顺序排列，不代表排名。

1、Archcraft



如果你想体验 Openbox 窗口管理器，Archcraft 是一个不错的选择。不像其他发行版，Openbox 是这个发行版的默认桌面环境，所以你可以期待它的表现优秀。

它提供了一个精简且轻量的环境，只需不到 500MB 的内存即可运行，而且外观上也没有降级。其界面元素风格统一。

你可以通过简单点击来切换主题，如果你喜欢，它还提供了类似 Windows 的用户界面。

对于资深用户来说，它内置了对 AUR 和 Chaotic-AUR 的支持。与其他发行版不同的是，它提供了最佳的开箱即用体验。


Archcraft


2、ArcolinuxB Openbox



如果你想学习 Arch（Arcolinux 项目的主要目标），ArcolinuxB Openbox 是一个非常优秀的 Linux 桌面发行版。

它是 ArcolinuxB 项目的众多变种之一。你可能会遇到一些学习曲线和不完善的地方。

与 Archcraft 不同，你在这里不会看到完全统一的界面元素，可能需要进行一些调整来获得良好的体验。

                              <span>《隐喻学范式》，[德]汉斯·布鲁门贝格著，李贯峰译，东方出版中心，2023年4月出版，275页，59.80元

尽管我们可以将德国思想家布鲁门贝格（Hans Blumenberg，1920-1996）的学术研究视为现代欧陆哲学隐喻复兴运动的重要组成，但他的思想风格既无法完全归入胡塞尔的现象学传统，也不属于重返修辞的后哲学论说。有趣的是，倘若我们试着列一份康德之后以独特生活方式著称的思想家名单，布鲁门贝格一定位列其中。与大多数犹太裔学者一样，布鲁门贝格在二战结束后返回校园，最初在汉堡大学师从胡塞尔的助手兰德格里伯（Ludwig Landgrebe，1902-1991）学习哲学、日耳曼学和古典语文学，后跟随他转入基尔大学，并在那里获得博士学位。1947年起，布鲁门贝格辗转汉堡大学、吉森大学、波鸿鲁尔大学和明斯特大学任教，直到1985年在明斯特退休。不接受采访，不参与学术和公共活动，退休后的布鲁门贝格以哲学隐士的姿态隐居于僻静之处。这不禁让人想起康德《纯粹理性批判》的题词：“关于自己，我们宁可沉默。”（De nobis ipsis silemus. 伽达默尔也曾将这句话写在自传扉页上）

1980年，布鲁门贝格获得弗洛伊德奖时发表演说。

归隐的生活状态和晦涩的写作风格削弱了布鲁门贝格的学术知名度，但也让一部分人相当着迷，小说家西碧拉·莱维查洛夫（Sibylle Lewitscharoff）便是其中之一。布鲁门贝格深爱与狮子有关的隐喻，他在《不在场的狮子：书斋里的圣哲罗姆》（Das Abwesende am Löwen: Hieronymus im Gehäus mit Sanduhr；收录于其身后整理出版的《狮子》一书）中讨论了一头试图攻击圣哲罗姆的狮子被圣人的雄辩和哲思驯服，从此庇护其左右的故事。莱维查洛夫由此得到灵感，创作了小说《布鲁门贝格》。在小说中，狮子在某天晚上悄然出…</span>

                              <span>I’m a linux noob but one day I would like to be able to help contribute to the kernel. I know i have an extremely long way too go but I was just curious on what it takes to actually contribute. I have a basic understanding of distros and the command line but other than that I’m no more knowledgeable than a windows user who just wanted to see what Linux was all about. I would like to also hear some things from actual developers!

 So, what do you recommend?

                              <span>(Could not ask at r/linuxquestions) As the title says, I have installed Linux on a late 2013 21,5 inch iMac with an Intel Core i5-4570R and Intel Iris(R) Pro Graphics 5200 (HSW GT3). I installed Ubuntu, Fedora, Linux Mint, Pop!_OS, Manajro, Arch Linux, Debian, Vanilla OS, etc. In all of them I had problems with overheating, no iGPU usage resulting in Twitch dropping frames like crazy and other problems. I will be switching to a PC soon and I wanted to clean the iMac, change the hard drive, reapply thermal paste and install Linux but this problems always persists. Any idea?

                              <span>After each reboot, everything works cool and stays within limits.
 But, after each incident of Hibernate or Hybrid/ Sleep, everything goes out of control: CPU Freq is much above Hardware Limit (2800 MHz) and Policy Limits (1900 HMz), and Over Heating: (CPU Freq near 3900 MHz, Temp 95℃, Fan 4600 RPM).
 Anyone has similar experience?

                              <span>I have a PC from the company but I wanted to install a dual boot.. I already tried to boot from the USB to the disc with Ubuntu and the PC does a reset but it accepts a virtual drive.. I honestly tried to do it from the system where Windows is from the pendrive . ..as a result I was without a system..I had to ask holdesk to install everything...I don&#x27;t have admin access and it has bitlocker...is there a solution?

                              <span>Hello Reddit (im new to reddit and linux so i dont know how to make an entrance) but to get to the point.
 I have T440p laptop on which i installed OpenSuse TW. I can only use it with external monitor because the built in screen wont turn on. I tried installing Nvidia drivers with Yast - and i did it - nothing special.
 But laptop is always using the iGPU (which i read online is the cause of the problem). Also using YAST i installed bbswitch and bumblebee, nvidia and suse prime and what not - but nothing is helping. I would like to be able to use the laptop on the go and without the external monitor. 
 Does anyone know how to fix this, because i really want to learn Linux and use it for school and am also switching from windows - but i spen almost two months trying to solve the problem without success. Thank you for your help in advance and see you

                              <span>I have a laptop, a sony vaio vpccw21fx. An old laptop, and i wanted to make it alive again, I found out that the battery is dead, and im not planning to replace it. Replaced the hard thermal paste on both gpu and cpus, then i tried running it with only the charger. I remember upgrading it from windows 7 to windows 10. It booted up successfully. After using it for some minutes, It just powers off. I have an inference that it is caused by the temperature, i tried turning on power saver and did almost everything to minimize the temperature in use. Then i decided to swtich the operating system to linux, xubuntu. Downloaded the media files, making a bootable drive to install, and then its now successfully installed with no interruptions. I ran the laptop on its coolest before I installed xubuntu. After the installation, the laptop is cooking, same temp before when trying windows 10. I tried to update and upgrade packages, after waiting for some time (it was like 33% don) the laptop just powered off. Same issue before, its got the cooking temp, still dont know the numbers, but it is really hot. I decided to install lm sensors after i booted up the system, lowered the brightness. I dont see any power consumption related settings other than sleep mode, display power management etc. Its currently idle for about half an hour, 51.0°c, 53.0°c (core 1 and 2). I will wait for it to measure if it can stay longer when idle. Ill test later when in-use.
 I wanted to know if there are any methods that can help reduce the temperature of my laptop using the os or fiddling with the computer&#x27;s configuration.
 Thank you!

                              <span>I own a SADES Gaming Armor headphone that works flawlessly in Windows but exhibits an unusual problem when connected to my Manjaro Linux system. The audio playback is incredibly slow, almost as if it&#x27;s playing at a speed of 0.01x. This slow playback speed issue affects both audio and video, making it nearly impossible to enjoy any media content.
 Despite my efforts to troubleshoot the problem, I have been unable to find a solution. Here&#x27;s what I have tried so far:
 ​
 Verified that the SADES Gaming Armor headphone is selected as the default output device in the Manjaro audio settings.
 Ensured that my Manjaro system is up to date with the latest packages and kernel (currently using kernel version 6.1.31-2-MANJARO).

kubectl (kube-ctl): kubectlis the command-line tool used to interact with the Kubernetes cluster. When you execute the command kubectl createor kubectl applywith a pod configuration file, kubectlcommunicates with the Kubernetes API server to create or update the pod. It sends the pod&#x27;s desired state to the API server for further processing.
 Scheduler: The scheduler is a component responsible for assigning pods to nodes in the cluster. When kubectlsends a pod specification to the Kubernetes API server, the scheduler examines the pod&#x27;s resource requirements, affinity/anti-affinity rules, and other constraints. It then selects an appropriate node to run the pod based on available resources, node conditions, and scheduling policies. The sched…</span>

 If we look at professional use and sum up the % of the platforms, it doesn&#x27;t add up to 100%.
 Wouldn&#x27;t WSL under Windows be considered Windows?
 If we add all the Linux distros together then the % is the highest?
 If we add up the responses of Linux distros, it&#x27;s ~47.5k which is higher than the responses for Windows - why did they list Windows as the most used platform?
 Why didn&#x27;t they group Linux under a single category?
 Not sure how to interpret the results here, any ideas?

                              <span>I recently had a more junior coworker take an AWS Solutions Architect course, and I realized I am missing out on my company&#x27;s personal development resources, but I am not all that interested in an AWS Solutions Architecture course, in part because a) I don&#x27;t want to, and b) I know a bunch of AWS stuff by now anyway
So I am curious what are some interesting educational resources for people in more advanced engineering roles? Courses or resources that might help one move to an Architect or Principal/Staff role?

                              <span>The AlmaLinux organization has posted a message
describing the impact of Red Hat&#x27;s decision to stop releasing the source to
the RHEL distribution and how AlmaLinux will respond.


	In the immediate term, our plan is to pull from CentOS Stream
	updates and Oracle Linux updates to ensure security patches
	continue to be released. These updates will be carefully curated to
	ensure they are 1:1 compatible with RHEL, while not violating Red
	Hat’s licensing, and will be vetted and tested just like all of our
	other releases.

                              <span>The quest to enable limited use of BPF features in unprivileged processes
continues.  In the previous episode, an
attempt to use authoritative Linux security module (LSM) hooks for this
purpose was strongly rejected by the LSM developers.  BPF developer Andrii
Nakryiko has now returned with a new mechanism based on a
privilege-conveying token.  That approach, too, has run into some
resistance, but a solution for the strongest concerns might be in sight.</span>

                              <span>RHEL 源代码将只放在 CentOS Stream 上

在没有宣布废弃 CentOS 之前，RHEL 的源代码会发布在 git.centos.org 上，那时候 CentOS 还是 RHEL 的下游。之后，在 CentOS Stream 成为 RHEL 的上游后，该仓库得以保留。红帽宣布，“CentOS Stream 将成为公开发布 RHEL 相关源代码的唯一仓库。对于红帽的客户和合作伙伴，源代码将继续通过红帽客户门户网站提供。”并进一步澄清，“这一变化并不意味着CentOS 项目、CentOS Stream 或 CentOS SIG 的源代码可用性有任何变化。”但这一举动引来了社区的一些人的担心，“Alma Linux，Rocky Linux，Oracle Linux 等将更难提供与 RHEL 版本 1:1 的二进制兼容的构建。”


消息来源：Phoronix



老王点评：我认为，从目前的声明上看，这种担心或许是多余的，我们只需要观察之后的 RHEL 和 CentOS Stream 之间差异有多大就好了。但从对这个事情的反应可以看出，社区对红帽的信任在降低。




Reddit 用户涌入 Lemmy

类似马斯克收购 Twitter 后 Twitter 难民涌入 Mastodon，大量 Reddit 难民涌入了 Lemmy 实例。其中，lemmy.world 实例的总用户数达到了 3.8 万。突然间，Lemmy 已经成为最大的联邦宇宙项目之一。在 Reddit 社区重新开放之后，部分用户可能会离开，但也许有更多用户会留下。

老王点评：这些联邦宇宙社区会得到更多用户，但 Twitter、Reddit 失血更多。




C++ 26 标准正在制定中

C++ 版本以其发布的年份命名，并遵循三年的周期。国际标准化组织 C++ 标准委员会发布了 C++ 26 的进展情况。根据其时间表，新语言功能的截止日期是 2024 年第三季度，功能冻结将在 2025 年第一季度。委员会已经通过了 40 份 “修改文件”，增加了 _ 字符通配符，基本字符集添加了 @、$ 和 &#x60;。此外，在 C++ 26 中还支持了危险指针。危险指针是指 “只有其所有者可以设置其值，而任何数量的线程都可以读取其值” 的指针，它很难导致非常常见的内存安全问题。

老王点评：在我看来，C++ 标准的演进有一定的意义，但是这并不能阻止其传统的领域被 Rust、Carbon 等新底层语言的侵蚀。</span>

mean 函数

在 R 中 mean 函数用来计算算术平均值。该函数接受一个 R 对象 x 作为参数，以及一个 trim 选项来在计算均值之前剔除任意比例的数据（LCTT 译注：比如对于一个含有 7 个元素的向量 x，设置 trim 为 0.2 表示分别去掉 x 中最大和最小的前 20% —— 即 1.4 个 —— 的元素，所去掉的元素的个数会向下取整，所以最终会去掉 1 个最大值和 1 个最小值；trim 取值范…</span>

当你习惯于一个操作系统时，很容易将其他操作系统看作是“应用程序”。如果你在桌面上使用一种操作系统，你可能会认为另一种操作系统是人们用来运行服务器的应用程序，而又一种操作系统是用来玩游戏的应用程序，依此类推。有时我们会忘记操作系统是计算机管理无数任务的部分（从技术上讲，每秒数百万个任务），它们通常设计成能够执行各种任务。当有人问我 Linux 能做什么 时，我通常会问他们想让它做什么。这没有一个单一的答案，所以这里有五个让我惊讶的 Linux 用途。

1、用 Linux 进行激光切割



在离我最近的创客空间里，有一台巨大的工业机器，大约和一张沙发一样大小，可以根据一个简单的线条图设计文件来切割各种材料。这是一台强大的激光切割机，令我惊讶的是，我第一次使用它时发现它只需要通过 USB 线连接到我的 Linux 笔记本电脑上。事实上，在许多方面，与许多台式打印机相比，连接这台激光切割机更容易，因为许多台式打印机需要过于复杂和臃肿的驱动程序。

使用 Inkscape 和 一个简单的插件，你可以为这台工业激光切割机设计切割线条。你可以为你的树莓派笔记本设计一个外壳，使用这些知识共享的设计方案来建造 一个密码锁盒、切割一个店面标牌，或者你心目中的其他任何想法。而且，你可以完全使用开源软件来完成这些操作。

2、在 Linux 上进行游戏



开源游戏一直都有，最近一段时间也有一些备受瞩目的 Linux 游戏。我建造的第一台游戏电脑就是一台 Linux 电脑，我觉得我邀请过来一起玩沙发合作游戏的人们都没有意识到他们是在 Linux 上进行游戏。这是一种流畅顺滑的体验，而且取决于你愿意在硬件上花费多少，可能上无止境吧。

美国学者莎拉·罗伯茨（Sarah T. Roberts）被誉为“数字时代的先锋研究者”，她在2010-2018年长达八年的时间里持续展开了对互联网公司中的商业性内容审核员群体的工作状况及生存环境的访谈调查与实例研究，《幕后之人：社交媒体时代的内容审核》（原书名Behind the Screen:Content Moderation in the Shadows of Social Media，2019）是一部具有开创性的互联网田野调查与社会学研究的专著。作者的调查对象与研究主题指向全球性的商业化社交媒体的内容审核运作：针对互联网上日益巨量而良莠混杂的内容，商业性内容审核是必要的工作，因此互联网公司要雇用数以百万计的内容审核员评估社交平台用户上传的信息，筛选和删除色情、暴力、仇恨言论等不良内容。但是由于各种原因，这个工作群体一直隐身于幕后，其游离于社会、薪资低微、劳累过度、精神创伤等生存状况亦一直未能引起社会关注与疗救。莎拉·罗伯茨克服了互联网公司保密协议、地域限制等重重困难，对从硅谷到菲律宾、从专业审核公司到主要社交媒体的一线员工进行了深度采访，全面考察、分析了互联网商业性内容审核工作的不同类型（短期合同工、专业公司、外包、零工）及作为“幕后之人”的审核员群体的工作与生存状况，同时也对内容审核与相关政策争议、对现实影响的关系进行了分析和阐述。“打开了一扇了解内容审核这一晦暗不明世界的窗口。……是数字经济这一关键领域的权威著作，必将影响未来几年的政策和研究。”联合国特别报告员大卫·凯依（David Kaye）对该书的这一评语是客观、中肯的。

黄宾虹曾跋：“巨然墨法自米氏父子、高房山、吴仲圭一脉相承，学者宗之，及董玄宰用兼皴带染法，娄东、虞山日益凌替，至道咸为之中兴。”（图一）黄宾虹从道光、咸丰年间金石碑学之昌盛中寻到了中国画变革的动力，以“道咸画学中兴说”批判自宋以降落向窠臼的传统艺术，在二十世纪上半叶掀起了一场以北宋为宗的中国画“文艺复兴”。在深空探测和AI技术获得突破性发展的二十一世纪二十年代，再次回溯百余年前中国画坛的风云变幻，我们有理由以更广阔的眼光观想一张与十九至二十世纪之际世界艺术之现代主义运动同构的中国画史图景。我们业已建立寻常的画史共识：清末绘画流于程式，日渐凌替，以黄宾虹、齐白石为代表的一批先锋者将中国画从陈陈相因的泥淖中解放出来，就此开创了二十世纪中国画的现代主义。

倘若我们将这一阶段视为中国画之现代性的起点，那么在百余年之后，我们是否能够，哪怕是在极为宽泛的层面上界说出中国画的后现代主义、解构主义？后现代在西方的生发有其具体的语境，将其去语境地附会在中国显然不是科学的思量，但唯独不可否认的是，这些“先锋的时髦语汇”被利用在当代中国极其繁荣的艺术活动中，可每每回归到作品——画面内部，我们的内心是否会不可避免地引发一丝对作者所宣称的思想的忧疑。形式与内容的不自洽使得我们在总体上很难坚定地否认，当代的中国画并没有完全摆脱、超越由现代主义者——黄宾虹、潘天寿诸家代表的世代所开创的“纪元”，即便我们已经走过了西方艺术史断代的现代主义时期。中国画的题材、创作手段、艺术形式较百余年前早已大相径庭，可为什么还要做出如此扫兴的论断？重大问题的症结首先并不出在方法、技术、媒材甚至概念上，而是归咎于深刻的意识层面，至少，中国画面对自…</span>

                              <span>6月21日消息，亿欧网创始人黄渊普发布一封举报信，实名举报全国政协委员、知乎创始人兼CEO周源恶意挑拨员工群体与企业主群体对立、严重破坏国内营商环境。黄渊普表示，恳请有关部门介入，调查我所说的情况；我愿意协助调查和调研，为有关部门提供必要的材料和证据。


以下为公开信全文：



黄渊普：实名举报全国政协委员、知乎创始人兼CEO周源恶意挑拨员工群体与企业主群体对立、严重破坏国内营商环境


尊敬的相关部门领导，我叫黄渊普，作为主要创始人做了一家叫“亿欧”《北京亿欧网盟科技有限公司》的小公司，籍贯为湖南邵阳，户籍所在地在上海市长宁区，身份证号43052719xx10xx42xx，联系方式为：15810157304。我今天实名举报全国政协委员、知乎〔北京智者天下科技有限公司，简称“知乎”）创始人兼CEO周源通过其创立的知乎平台、设置不合理的机制恶意挑拨了员工群体与企业主群体对立、严重破坏了国内营商环境。


以下为我的陈述，我对我所说的话负责；


2023年6月20日上午，在听到一位创业者朋友抱怨自己在知乎平台上被人匿名诽谤的事情后，我也在知乎上搜索了一下自己的名字“黄渊普”。发现一个“提问”（目前知乎上已经被删）∶亿欧黄渊普会卷钱跑路吗？


这个提问由知乎的匿名用户以匿名的方式提出。但其实，亿欧是科创产业智库，商业模式主要是给科技企业提供研究、咨询、品牌等服务，主营业务应收账款较大，只有占营收非常小的会员和VIP服务采取先付款后提供服务的方式。


这个提问和描述十分恶意，把我本人与某不同行业领域的企业负责人做恶意对比。这个提问，在我发现它之前，它应该已经存在一段时间（知乎的“提问”不对外显示提问时间）。在我发现这个提问之前，它对我个人名誉已经造成了损害，对公司品牌和人才招聘也有不利影响。


这不是我第一次在知乎上遭遇这类匿名提问和匿…</span>

                              <span>Hey everyone, I was doing some research about Linus&#x27;s education, but I couldn&#x27;t find any information about if he got a bacholer or no, the only thing I know that he said he got a master&#x27;s degree in 8 years and half, I searched everywhere far and wide every corner of the internet and only got the results of his master&#x27;s degree and nothing about a bacholer, any ideas?

                              <span>I have a several TB media library I am trying to copy from my linux mint PC to a samba share running in a Proxmox lxc. Files are 0.8 to 2 GB each.
 I&#x27;ve tried copying several ways:
  
cp
 rsync
 tar cf - [source] | (cd [destination]; tar xfp -)
 Nemo gui file transfer
  
Each time I get the same result, the first file transfers quickly at ~200 MB/s, and then slows to ~15 MB/s for subsequent files. Except nemo which is just terribly slow from the beginning. I don&#x27;t know how to troubleshoot the cause of the slowdown any further and would appreciate any suggestions you might have. thanks!

 I am trying to use transmission to download and I swear I have exhausted all of my options on this. anytime I try to download something it errors and says permission denied even tho I have opened the directory with 777. I have googled everywhere about this and can&#x27;t find anything. I should also mention that I had it working perfectly fine before it had no issue downloading, but then I wanted to move the folder and it is just not accepting it.
 thanks in advance

I use fedora Linux but I am willing to switch distro for this and using an iPad Pro 3th gen. Any suggestions?

                              <span>Hi,
 I have several nvme devices in my Ubuntu 22.04.02 machine and I&#x27;d like to manually calculate the write amplification of each device by dividing nand_bytes_written / host_bytes_written.
 I believe host_bytes_written can be calculated in the following manner:
 $ nvme smart-log /dev/nvme0n1 |grep -e data_units_written data_units_written : 32,800,047 $ echo $((32800047*512000/1000**4)) 16 &lt;-- value in TB 
 The above can be proven by using dd:
 $ nvme smart-log /dev/nvme0n1 |grep -e data_units_written data_units_written : 32,800,047 $ dd if&#x3D;/dev/zero of&#x3D;/dev/nvme0n1 bs&#x3D;512000 count&#x3D;1000 oflag&#x3D;direct 1000+0 records in 1000+0 records out 512000000 bytes (512 MB, 488 MiB) copied, 0.967242 s, 529 MB/s $ nvme smart-log /dev/nvme0n1 |grep -e data_units_written data_units_written : 32,801,047 &lt;--…</span>

 https://www.phoronix.com/news/Red-Hat-CentOS-Stream-Sources
 By limiting the RHEL public sources to CentOS Stream, it will now be more difficult for community/off-shoot enterprise Linux distributions like Alma Linux, Rocky Linux, Oracle Linux, etc, to provide 1:1 binary compatible builds against given RHEL releases.
 Seems like another move to kill off Alma or Rocky

                              <span>I&#x27;ve been contemplating a switch from ArchLinux to Ubuntu and had a couple of concerns regarding Snap apps and package installation. I&#x27;ve heard mixed opinions about the startup speed of Snap apps in Ubuntu and wanted to know if it&#x27;s a common issue or something that can be optimized. Additionally, I&#x27;ve come across comments stating that Ubuntu pushes users to install software exclusively through snaps, rather than using traditional deb packages. Is this true, and are there any limitations or drawbacks to this approach?

                              <span>Hello Hacker News community,
Wanted to share a project I started working on during my spare time and was then discovered by many in the open source community last week.
GPT Engineer’s mission:
Be the open platform for devs to tinker with and build their personal code-generation toolbox.
I believe it&#x27;s key for us devs to engage in how building software can and will change.
You can find more info about the flexible technical &quot;philosophy&quot; to make it work well, and the community we want it to become on github:
https://github.com/AntonOsika/gpt-engineer
The project is still in early stages. It&#x27;s clear that there is a lot of room for improvement as the space to combine tricks that guide LLM&#x27;s is large.
Appreciate any suggestions, experiences, or ideas on the project from you all!

                              <span>Kernel support for copy offload is a feature that has been floating around
in limbo for a decade or more at this point; it has been implemented along 
the way, but never merged.  The idea is that the host
system can simply ask a block storage device to copy some data within the device
and it 
will do so without further involving the host; instead of reading data into
the host so that it can be written back out again, the device circumvents
that process.  At the
2023 Linux Storage, Filesystem,
Memory-Management and BPF Summit, Nitesh Shetty led a storage and
filesystem session to discuss the current status of a patch set that he and
others have been working on, with an
eye toward getting something merged fairly soon.</span>

that public source releases will be restricted to CentOS Stream going
forward:


	As the CentOS Stream community grows and the enterprise software
	world tackles new dynamics, we want to sharpen our focus on CentOS
	Stream as the backbone of enterprise Linux innovation. We are
	continuing our investment in and increasing our commitment to
	CentOS Stream. CentOS Stream will now be the sole repository for

                              <span>Running a Linux distribution on Arm-based single-board computers (SBCs)
is still not as easy as on x86 systems because many Arm devices require a
vendor-supplied kernel, a patched bootloader, and other device-specific
components. One distribution that addresses this problem is Armbian, which offers Debian- and
Ubuntu-based distributions for
many devices. The headline feature in the recent release, Armbian
23.05, which came at the end of May, is a major rework of the build
framework that has been made faster and more reliable after three years of
development.</span>

                              <span>据美联社报道，Twitter（推特）员工昨日向旧金山联邦法院提起诉讼，要求该公司兑现有关奖金的承诺。


员工们表示，在马斯克收购该公司之前的一个月里，包括前首席财务官内德・西格尔（Ned Segal）在内的高管“一再”向员工承诺，将支付他们 2022 年奖金的 50%。但随着马斯克的到来，这些关于奖金的承诺至今没有落地。


此次诉讼案件的首席原告马克・肖宾格（Mark Schobinger）是上月刚从 Twitter 离职的前薪酬高级总监，他的律师正代表 Twitter 现员工和前员工寻求集体诉讼。原告律师香农・利斯・赖尔丹（Shannon Liss-Riordan）表示，Twitter 所欠奖金达到“数千万美元”。


已经被马斯克解散媒体关系团队的 Twitter 除了自动回复外，没有就此给出其他回复评论。


此前报道，马斯克收购 Twitter 后一直在进行包括大幅裁员在内的各种成本压缩政策，这也导致该公司正面临来自前雇员的多起诉讼，以及众多尚未支付的账单。此前 Twitter 被曝出拒绝支付即将到期的谷歌云账单，并因拖欠房租被驱逐出位于美国科罗拉多州博尔德市的办公室。

阿兰·图灵在 1950 年代提出了最早的对 AI 的测试，人类评估者判断他们是在和人类还是与 AI 说话。如果 AI 能冒充人类，那么它就通过了图灵测试。DeepMind 联合创始人 Mustafa Suleyman 在其新书中否定了传统的图灵测试，因为“它没有告诉我们系统能做什么或理解什么，是否建立了复杂的内心独白，或能在抽象的时间范围内进行规划”。他提出了新的图灵测试，“让 AI 将 10 万美元的种子基金变成 100 万美元，以此衡量 AI 是否具有类人的智能”。AI 需要研究一个电商方案，制定产品计划，找到制造商和销售商品。他预测 AI 将在两年内实现这一目标：“我们不只关心机器能说什么，我们还关心它能做什么。”

老王点评：之前我们在 #1036 报道过，AI 撰写的商业计划书获得了更多投资人的青睐，我就谈到或许以后可以直接投资 AI 管理运营的企业。现在看起来，这个日子不会太远。不过，要是 AI 都会自己赚钱了，可以自己养自己了，还要人类干啥？




OpenAI 准备建立 AI 应用商店

据透露，OpenAI 正在考虑推出一个应用市场，客户可以将他们根据自己的需要定制的人工智能模型出售给其他企业。例如，可以发现在线零售交易中的金融欺诈，或回答有关特定市场的最新信息的模型。目前还不清楚 OpenAI 是否会对这些销售收取佣金，或者以其他方式从市场上获得收入。


消息来源：The Information



老王点评：有苹果应用商店的成功在前，这真是一个聪明的主意。不过我更倾向于将来会有 AI 自己使用的一种交易机制，AI 们可以在其中交易训练数据、模型权重和特定的模型等，并通过买来或学到的“技能”换取更多的交易机会。




微软计划淘汰原生的邮件和日历应用引来批评

微软打算关闭其时常被人诟病的邮件和日历应用程序，将其功能放到新的 Windows 版 Outlook 中。然而，尽管多年来用户对这些应用程序提出了一些批评，但对上述决定有一些强烈的负面反应。有用户评论，“看到微软为 Windows 开发网络应用，却为安卓、iOS 和 MacOS 打造高质量的原生应用，这有点搞笑，但也很悲哀。”用户认为淘汰邮件和日历的决定是对 WinUI 原生工具包的信心丧失，“如果你不能将 UWP 应用程序移植到本地工具包，这基本上就是承认没有人应该建立原生 Windows 应用程序。甚至微软也不使用他们自己的工具包。”


消息来源：The Register



老王点评：虽然邮件和日历应用有点鸡肋，但是连微软都不在自己的 Windows 上开发原生的应用，而用网络应用敷衍——这恐怕不完全是因为网络应用更流行，也是原生应用走衰的趋势吧。</span>

Open For All，LLUG 经验与你共享

LLUG 举办的初衷是希望让大家可以从线上重归线下，与更多的人可以当面交流，迸发出灵感和创新的火花。而我们自己的力量是薄弱的，不足以支撑足够高频和多次的线下活动，我们希望有更多的人可以参与到线下活动的组织过程中。

所以，我们将我们的活动举办经验开放出来，方便有志于组织线下活动的同好们，可以和我们一起组织线下活动，促进更多的线下交流和沟通。

你可以在 https://github.com/Linux-CN/LLUG-Guides/tree/main 找到我们开放出来的 LLUG 活动组织手册，并参考手册，组织你自己的线下活动。

当然，在组织线下活动过程中，如果你认为手册有值得优化的点，也期待你能参与到项目的贡献当中，我们一起共建一个更好的活动组织手册。

                              <span>使用 Bash 中的 for 循环，为网页创建一个方便的调色板。


当计算机显示器的调色板有限时，网页设计师通常使用一组 Web 安全颜色 来创建网站。虽然在较新设备上显示的现代网站可以显示比最初的 Web 安全调色板更多的颜色，但我有时喜欢在创建网页时参考 Web 安全颜色。这样我就知道我的网页在任何地方都看起来不错。

你可以在网上找到 Web 安全调色板，但我想拥有自己的副本以方便参考。你也可以使用 Bash 中的 for 循环创建一个。

Bash for 循环

Bash 中的 for 循环 的语法如下所示：

for 变量 in 集合 ; do 语句 ; done


例如，假设你想打印从 1 到 3 的所有数字。你可以快速在 Bash 命令行上编写一个 for 循环来为你完成这项工作：

$ for n in 1 2 3 ; do echo $n ; done
1
2
3


分号是标准的 Bash 语句分隔符。它们允许你在一行中编写多个命令。如果你要在 Bash 脚本文件中包含这个 for 循环，你可以用换行符替换分号并像这样写出 for 循环：

for n in 1 2 3
  do
    echo $n
  done


我喜欢将 do 和 for 放在同一行，这样我更容易阅读：

for n in 1 2 3 ; do
  echo $n
done


一次多个 for 循环

你可以将一个循环放在另一个循环中。这可以帮助你迭代多个变量，一次做不止一件事。假设你想打印出字母 A、B 和 C 与数字 1、2 和 3 的所有组合。你可以在 Bash 中使用两个 for 循环来实现，如下所示：

#!/bin/bash
for number in 1 2 3 ; do
  for letter …</span>

李林先生所著《清代武科考试研究》（以下简称“李著”）终于在2022年底出版了。该书一经面世，即在科举学界赢得一片赞誉。几个月来，我认真拜读了“李著”，深感这是一部超越以往研究清代武举制度的上乘之作，可谓是后来居上。
一
“李著”是在其博士论文基础上修改完成的。2014年，我曾赴香港中文大学参加李林的博士论文答辩，了解原稿的情况。现在的成果较之九年前的博士论文《“干城之选”——清代武举制度之设计、运作及其功效》，已在史料、论证、数字统计等多方面有了新的突破。一部博士论文经八年之久的修改才出版，这是不多见的，可见作者用功之勤。这八年，他坚持不懈，不断补充，不断完善（其间，我曾两次询问，他都回答还在修改之中），最终使该书在研究的深度、广度上都有了大幅度的提升，至少让我感觉是面目一新。
人们之所以赞誉“李著”，是因为以往研究武举考试的不多，特别是从制度层面研究的则更少，“李著”恰恰填补了这一空白。武科研究成果较少，原因有二。一是在科举时代，武科不如文科地位重要，在社会上的影响更是远不及文科。况且科举选官只是入仕之选，今后的升迁则靠个人的能力。文官靠官场上的政绩，武官则靠战场上的军功，因此对于武科出身者而言，军功更重于出身（“李著”也充分论述了这一点）。文科出身而统率军队者不乏其人。如康熙三十九年进士年羹尧于雍正初任抚远大将军，主持西北军务，平定罗卜藏丹津叛乱，有《年大将军兵法》传世。雍正时的著名军事将领张广泗、岳钟琪，均非武举出身。因为武科一直不受重视，研究者当然也就不多。二是武科留下的史料远不及文科那么丰富，这也造成武科研究的一定困难，让人望而止步。最早研究清代科举制度的专著是商衍鎏先生的《清代科举考试述录》，全书共八章，该书只是在第五章第一节讲武科，简单介绍了武童试、武乡试、武会试、武殿试。…</span>

                              <span>Hello community,
 As you may know, we went dark for over a week to protest a recent change announced by reddit.
 Here is a link to what is happening and why we went dark: https://www.reddit.com/r/ModCoord/comments/1476fkn/reddit_blackout_2023_save_3rd_party_apps/
 ​
  
Apollo made 7 billion requests last month, which would put it at about 1.7 million dollars per month, or 20 million US dollars per year. Even if I only kept subscription users, the average Apollo user uses 344 requests per day, which would cost $2.50 per month, which is over double what the subscription currently costs, so I&#x27;d be in the red every month.
  
We have received a message from the Admin team basically demanding that we stop the protest of the recent API changes or we will be removed: https://i.imgur.com/s7kM6j5.png
 The mod team is currently discussing ways to continue participating in the API protest without putting the subreddit at risk. A few ways that other subreddits have implemented are:
  
One day a week blackouts
 
Banning a specific letter and removing posts/comments that include that letter
 
Marking the subreddit as NSFW since this is all motivated by maximizing advertising revenue for their upcoming IPO
 
 ​
 The list of demands that need to be addressed as a result of this change: https://www.reddit.com/r/ModCoord/comments/148ks6u/indefinite_blackout_next_steps_polling_your/jo0pqzk/
 Please share your feedback and any suggestions you may have for showing our support to 3rd party apps and scripts that will be negatively impacted by this API change.

                              <span>Imagine running a retail business without knowing how much you&#x27;re paying your wholesaler for goods. Or running a restaurant without looking at the price of your ingredients. Or constructing homes without looking at the price of raw materials... you get the idea.
That lack of transparency would be frightening, but hey, things could still work out, right?
Well, let&#x27;s up the difficulty.
Imagine that, on top of not knowing exactly how much you were paying for your inputs, you also didn&#x27;t know if you would have consistent and continued access to your wholesaler, your food supplier, or your building materials. That would almost certainly induce high blood pressure, stomach ulcers, and mild insomnia.

                              <span>Hi HN! I&#x27;m excited to share Autolabel, an open-source Python library to label and enrich text datasets with any Large Language Model (LLM) of your choice.
We built Autolabel because access to clean, labeled data is a huge bottleneck for most ML/data science teams. The most capable LLMs are able to label data with high accuracy, and at a fraction of the cost and time compared to manual labeling. With Autolabel, you can leverage LLMs to label any text dataset with https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id&#x3D;36409201

                              <span>Backporting fixes to stable kernels is an ongoing process that, in general,
is handled by the stable maintainers or the developers of the fixes.
However, due 
to some unhappiness in the XFS development
community with the process of handling stable fixes for that filesystem,
a different process has come about for backporting XFS patches to the
stable kernels.  The three developers doing that work, Leah Rumancik, Amir
Goldstein, and Chandan Babu Rajendra, led a plenary session at the 
2023 Linux Storage, Filesystem,
Memory-Management and BPF Summit  (with Rajendra
participating remotely)  to discuss that process.</span>

	the language and standard libraries, administration of
	infrastructure, etc.) remain with the nine top level teams.

经阿里巴巴控股集团董事会同意，张勇将于今年9月10日卸任阿里巴巴控股集团董事会主席兼CEO职务。张勇此后将专职担任阿里云智能集团董事长兼CEO，专注阿里云的发展，持续提升阿里云的行业竞争力与全球竞争力，让阿里云为各行业尤其中小企业的数智化升级提供更优质安全便捷的基础服务。同时，经过阿里巴巴控股集团董事会批准，集团执行副主席蔡崇信将出任阿里巴巴控股集团董事会主席；吴泳铭出任阿里巴巴控股集团CEO，同时继续兼任淘天集团董事长。


“过去24年间，我们有过很多次这样自我变革的时刻。如今，我们大家又一起站在一个新的起点上，开启一个通过自我变革、开辟未来发展的新阶段。”张勇在全员信中表示。



附：阿里巴巴集团董事会主席兼CEO张勇6月20日全员信


各位阿里人，


自从2015年5月担任阿里巴巴集团的CEO以来，我每年总会要给大家写几封信。也许大家已经习惯了，看到我发的全员信的时候，就知道公司又有重要的变化要发生。今天我又给大家写信了，给大家带来的是一个关于我自己的重要变化。


自今年3月宣布了集团“1+6+N”组织变革以后，目前各项工作都在平稳有序地推进。我们在上季度财报发布的时候公布了各业务集团董事会的组成，目前各个董事会都已经开始运行。我们也公布了各业务集团和业务单元的多个计划，包括将云智能集团从阿里集团完全分拆上市，以及菜鸟集团和盒马启动上市，海外数字商业集团的独立融资等等。整个阿里巴巴正以全新姿态奔向未来。


大家都知道，云计算、大数据和人工智能等核心技术的发展将会给社会带来巨大的变革，战略意义非常重大。目前云智能集团的完全分拆工作已经开始启动，正处于最关键时刻，要求必须全身心投入其中，同时也是考虑到分拆过程中公司规范化治理的要求，我个人不宜再同时担任两家集团的董事长和首席执行官的职责。因此，阿里巴巴集团董事会讨论并接受了我的请求：自2023年9月10日起，我将不再继续担任阿里巴巴集团董事会主席和首席执行官，而专心全职做好阿里云智能集团董事长兼首席执行官的工作。同时，阿里巴巴集团董事会决定，蔡崇信（Joe C. Tsai）将接替我成为阿里巴巴集团董事会主席，吴泳铭（Eddie Yongming Wu）将接替我成为阿里巴巴集团首席执行官。他们两位都是阿里巴巴的创始人和合伙人，都在阿里巴巴集团历史发展中做出了重要贡献，都拥有丰富的经验，相信在他们的领导下，公司能够走向更辉煌的未来。


这次的变化不仅对公司、对我个人都是另一个新阶段、新旅程的开始。时光过得真快，今年是我在阿里的第十六个年头。十六年一路同行，尤其是2015年接任集团首席执行官、2019年接任集团董事会主席以来，正是因为大家对我的信任、支持、鼓励和包容，让我在这个自己从未想象到的岗位上全情投入至今，对此我衷心地感激和感谢大家。这十六年来，因为社会进步、市场发展的时代机遇，我有幸和大家一起见证了阿里巴巴高速发展的历史阶段，参与了很多从无到有、从小到大、惠及普通人的生活、惠及企业数字化进程、惠及社会美好的创造；也和大家一起共同经受住了最近三年来新冠疫情的挑战和外部环境变化带来的种种考验。无论顺境还是逆境，我们一起不仅共同成长、共同经历、共同度过，也共同收获了很多比事业更宝贵的友谊和情义。


过去24年间，我们有过很多次这样自我变革的时刻。如今，我们大家又一起站在一个新的起点上，开启一个通过自我变革、开辟未来发展的新阶段。我相信大家会支持好Joe和吴泳铭等新一届集团高年级同学的工作，每个人都能够找到属于自己的舞台和属于自己的事业，最终能贡献社会、成就公司，也能够成就自己。我也会和云智能的同学们一起站在一个全新的舞台上，一起去探索利用云计算、大数据、人工智能的全新技术，服务于千行百业数字化、智能化的巨大前景，对此我充满憧憬和期待。


青山不改，绿水长流，创造一个新的江湖，再相会，任逍遥！

谷歌对外宣传 Bard 有助于开发者提高工作效率，但它对内警告员工不要使用 Bard 生成的代码。谷歌解释称，它的内部使用禁令是因为 Bard 会产生不需要的代码建议，潜在会导致程序出现错误或过于复杂，软件过于臃肿，相比不使用 AI 辅助编程需要更多时间修复。该公司表示，它的目标是对其技术的局限性保持透明 —— Bard 会提出不想要的代码建议，但它还是有助于程序员。

老王点评：合着还是拿用户做小白鼠啊，所以你放心使用 AI 生成的代码用在生产环境吗？




Reddit 抗议活动仍在继续中

上周一二，Reddit 版主们为了抗议 Reddit 的 API 定价政策而宣布关闭他们管理的子区，最高时期超过 90% 的子区变成了私有或限制发帖状态。直到一周后，仍有三千多个子区继续抗议，但最大的一些已经重新开放，不过这些子区将他们的抗议改为到张贴喜剧演员约翰·奥利弗的照片，“所有帖子都必须是约翰·奥利弗看起来很性感的图片”。Reddit 声称，它做出 API 价格改变是为了从 AI 需求中获利，AI 可以利用其托管的内容进行大型语言模型训练。

老王点评：即便是迫于 IPO 压力，但我说，Reddit 这件事办的很糟糕，最后很可能是两败俱伤的结果。




Meta 宣布危险到不能公布代码的语音生成 AI 模型

Meta 公司昨天宣布了一个名为 Voicebox 的新人工智能模型，它说这是迄今为止功能最全面的语音生成器，“但由于滥用的潜在风险”，目前没有公开提供 Voicebox 模型或代码。该模型仍然只是一个研究项目，Meta 公司说它可以从短至两秒的样本中生成六种语言的语音，未来可用于 “自然、真实” 的翻译等方面。

                              <span>你是否计划在 Linux 上采用以 KDE Plasma 为基础的稳定桌面环境，并打算将其作为日常工作环境？在这里，我们为你介绍与 KDE Plasma 更好集成的前十个 Linux 发行版。


KDE Plasma 桌面环境如今已经成为数百万用户的选择。借助活跃的开发者和社区的支持，它不断改进并推出与技术潮流相符的新功能。经过多年的发展，KDE 技术现在已经能够运行在桌面、笔记本电脑、平板电脑、手机和手持游戏设备上。这对于一个桌面环境来说是非常令人惊叹的，不是吗？

我经常听到或读到 KDE 桌面的各种问题，或者与 GNOME 相比被认为它的“选项太多”。我同意这些观点。但是我们不能忽视一个事实，尽管有这些争议和不同看法，KDE Plasma 桌面环境仍然是任何个人或企业使用场景的首选解决方案之一。它有一个成熟的路线图，采用独特的 Qt 技术构建，甚至能够在汽车和其他平台上运行。此外，它还有一个专门的基金会，拥有大量开发者，每天在努力改进这个桌面环境。

这就是为什么我撰写这篇文章的目的。有数百种 Linux 发行版支持 KDE Plasma 桌面环境。但是应该选择哪一个呢？它们各自有什么优势和劣势？哪一个对我来说最好？我们将在本文中尝试回答所有这些问题，并帮助你自行做出决策。

KDE Plasma 桌面的十大 Linux 发行版

我基于使用情况而非技术术语（如安装、终端使用等）编制了以下列表。

1、Kubuntu



Kubuntu 是 Ubuntu Linux 操作系统的官方 KDE Plasma 桌面版本。它使用与 Ubuntu 相同的基础软件包，并遵循 Ubuntu 的发布计划。这意味着它在 Ubuntu 发布新版本时也会发布新版本。由于基于 Ubuntu，你可以享受到伴随 Kubuntu 版本的庞大的帮助和支持社区。Kubuntu 是…</span>

                              <span>文档查看器是每个 Linux 发行版的必备软件，可以用来阅读 PDF 等格式的文件。

Ubuntu 等发行版上的文档查看器一般是 GNOME 中的 Evince（LCTT 译注：读作 /ɪˈvɪns/）。Evince 支持多种文件格式，非常方便。

但是除了 Evince，还有很多其他的文档阅读应用。比如 Linux 上优秀的电子书阅读应用 Foliate（LCTT 译注：读作 /ˈfəʊlɪɪt/）。

最近我又发现了另一个文档查看器：Zathura。

用 Zathura 获得摆脱鼠标的阅读体验

Zathura 是一个高度可定制的文档查看器，基于 girara 用户界面 和几个文档库。girara 实现了一个简单、最小的用户界面。

Zathura 的加载速度极快。它极其简约，没有侧边栏、菜单栏等元素。（LCTT 译注：其实 Zathura 的界面没有那么单一，按 Tab 键可以显示索引页；Zathura 有一个 guioptions 选项来设置是否显示命令行、状态栏、水平滚动条、垂直滚动条等 GUI 元素。）



按 : 键可以打开 Zathura 的命令行提示符，按 Esc 键可以退出命令行。

如果要新建书签，可以输入 :bmark 后面跟想要对这个书签设置的索引号。



按 F 键可以高亮所有链接，每条链接附带一个序号，并且界面底部会显示命令行提示符。在命令行中输入链接对应的序号，按下回车可以用系统默认的浏览器打开该链接。



Zathura 还支持自动重新载入。如果文件被其他应用修改（LCTT 译注：比如在修改 LaTeX 源文件并重新编译得到新的 PDF 之后）， Zathura 会自动重载修改后的文件。

你还可以安装 插件 来扩展 Zathura 的功能，比如阅读 漫画comics 或 PostScript 文件。

《郑孝胥日记》，中华书局1993年10月版

郑孝胥，字苏戡，一字太夷，因居所名曰“海藏楼”得号海藏，常以号行。福建闽侯人，生于苏州，长于福州。中国近现代著名诗人、书法家和政治家。1882年福建乡试解元，长期佐幕张之洞，备受器重。1903年两广总督岑春煊委为洋务处督办、营务处总办，驻军龙州，筹粮饷，开银号，办教育，卓有建树，允文允武，诚人生得意之秋，旋于1905年辞归上海。1911年诏任湖南布政使，未到任而清已亡，遂成为海上坚定的逊清遗老。1923年经陈宝琛引荐，入故宫任懋勤殿行走，1924年再任总理内务大臣，1925年任张园行在总务处总管，1932年伪满洲国成立后出任国务院总理兼文教部总长，走上“不归之路”，最后于1938年病死长春。
闽人闽菜，理所当然
郑孝胥在上海近二十年，从事路矿、金融、新闻、出版等事业，并多年担任商务印书馆董事长，其间诗酒风流，与遗老唱和，与时贤周旋，特别是组织或参与壬午同年会、一元会、消寒会等雅集活动，对我们了解早期闽、川菜馆在上海的发展及其与上海文化建设的关系，大有裨益，因为这是郑氏宴集最主要的两帮菜馆；之所以闽、川菜馆合论，则是因为早期上海闽菜与川菜风格特色相近，最典型的就是消闲别墅的菜品，常在闽川之间游移，以致时人莫辨，各种指南录之类书籍，便干脆标为闽川菜馆。
郑孝胥第一次在上海上餐馆，是1883年3月8日，进京赴试，经上海：“往滋卿处，同至聚丰园，邀叶小莱舅翁饮。”（引自《郑孝胥日记》，中华书局1993年10月版，以下引用该著不另出注）这聚丰园，从其新张开业广告来看，最初可能是家京菜馆：“启者：本园开设上洋四马路，精制满汉大菜、挂炉猪鸭、透味油鸡，四时佳肴，预定包办。外国大菜，一切鲜品，不另细载。谨择四月初一日开（业）。”（《新开聚丰园》，《申报》1877年4月30日第6版）后来杭州袭名而开的聚丰园正是京菜馆兼营番菜，适成佐证…</span>

                              <span>Hi!
I’m Julien and I built a recommendation engine for Hacker News.
I feel like this website is a gold mine. Every day, I find some very interesting stories about a topic. And sometimes, I want to find other stories covering that same topic but I can’t.
Hacker News has years of history of awesome discussion and ressources. Unfortunately, I think HN Algolia isn’t helpful in searching these old threads. As a student, I want to learn a lot from this website.
This is why I created HN Recommend. Input a sentence or the URL of an article, and get the most popular and similar posts from Hacker News.
About the technical details, I&#x27;ve computed the embeddings of over 100,000 articles from HN and indexed it using Faiss. I made a blog post for a deeper explanation.

the launch of a new web site
that is intended to be a better introduction to the free-software
community.


	Some of my criticisms focused on the message: fsf.org and gnu.org
	together suffer from no small degree of incomprehensibility and
	inaccessibility which makes it difficult for new participants to
	learn about the movement and apply it in practice to their own
	projects.

	This is something which is relatively easily fixed!</span>

                              <span>In the fast-moving open-source world, programs can come and go quickly; a
tool that has many users today can easily be eclipsed by something better
next week.  Even in this environment, though, some programs endure for a
long time.  As an example, consider the
PostgreSQL database system, which traces its
history back to 1986.  Making fundamental changes to a large code base
with that much history is never an easy task.  As fundamental changes go,
moving PostgreSQL away from its process-oriented model is not a small one,
but it is one that the project is considering seriously.</span>

Stack Overflow 2023 年 5 月的调查显示，45.55% 的受访者使用 PostgreSQL，而 MySQL 为 41.09%，SQLite 为 30.9%。三年前，同样的调查中，MySQL 占 55.6%，PostgreSQL 占 36.1%。需要注意的是，这是一个开发者调查，它并不反映生产中的使用情况。此外，微软的 SQL Server 是排名最高的全商业数据库引擎，使用比例为 25.45%，比 2020 年的 33% 有所下降。


消息来源：Dev Class



老王点评：其实 PostgreSQL 在特性方面一直比 MySQL 好，但是这十多年来就一直被 MySQL 压着打。我接触的第一个开源数据库是 PostgreSQL 而不是 MySQL。现在似乎 MySQL 有点颓势了，而 PostgreSQL 多年的坚持得到了开发者们的认可。如果你是开发者，你会考虑选择哪个呢？




红帽准备开发 CentOS Stream 10

根据红帽工程师分享的 Fedora Enterprise Linux Next（ELN） 计划，推出 CentOS Stream 10 的进程正在进行中，这将最终形成 Red Hat Enterprise Linux（RHEL）10 的基础。预计将在 7 月把所有 Fedora ELN 内容大量导入 CentOS Stream 10。CentOS Stream 的目标是在明年 2 月的 Fedora 40 之前，不与 Fedora 分叉。预计 RHEL 10 将在 2025 年发布。


消息来源：Phoronix



老王点评：无论如何，我都觉得红帽放弃 CentOS 的战略是一大败笔，至少这件事可以做的更好。当然，任何决定背后都有其根本利益的驱动，红帽这样做无可厚非，只是如今这个局面可能是他们最初也没预料的吧。




英特尔简化其 CPU 品牌组合

英特尔已经宣布从下一代 Meteor Lake CPU 开始对其处理器品牌进行一些改变。最小的变化是，英特尔的主流 CPU 将失去其 “i”，从 Core i3/i5/i7/i9 转变为简单的 Core 3/5/7/9。英特尔还将停止在其处理器品牌中使用 “代” 的信息 —— 不会有被宣传为 “第 14 代” 的新 CPU，但会在 CPU 编号中包含世代编号。这是英特尔处理器品牌战略更广泛调整的一部分。去年，该公司放弃了低端笔记本电脑 CPU 的奔腾和赛扬品牌名称，它现在将这些英特尔处理器称为英特尔处理器。


消息来源：Ars Technica



老王点评：这些 CPU 厂商的命名真是有点随意，编号和实际的技术有时候有点脱节。</span>

                              <span>如果你正在找寻适合你的系统的完美发行版，那么选择基于 Ubuntu 的发行版的可能性非常高。

你可能会问为什么。

嗯，毫不奇怪，Ubuntu 是 最适合初学者的 Linux 发行版之一。它也非常流行，这就是为什么你会发现它拥有庞大的用户社区。不仅如此，它还广泛用于 云服务器 上。

因此，将 Ubuntu 作为 Linux 发行版的基础应该带来一些有用的优势，对吧？

这就是为什么我列出了基于 Ubuntu 的最佳发行版清单，希望你能找到一款足够出色，让你停止频繁更换发行版的选择。

1、Ubuntu 官方衍生版



如果你不喜欢 Ubuntu 官方提供的 GNOME 桌面环境，你可以尝试官方衍生版，它们在 Ubuntu 的基础上提供了不同的桌面环境。

简单来说，你将得到同样的 Ubuntu 使用体验，但拥有不同的用户界面。

为了让你的用户体验更加愉快，这些桌面环境已经进行了预调整和主题设置，这使它们成为了那些希望拿来即用的完美选择。

以下是可用的选项：


Kubuntu（KDE Plasma）

Lubuntu（最节约资源的选择，使用 LXDE/LXQT）

Ubuntu Studio（面向创作者的发行版）

Ubuntu Budgie（Budgie 桌面环境）

Ubuntu Kylin（专为中国用户定制）

Ubuntu MATE（使用 MATE 桌面和工具）

Xubuntu（Xfce 桌面）


此外，你还可以在 Ubuntu 22.10 中发现一个带有经典 Unity 桌面环境的新的官方衍生版，因为 Ubuntu Unity Remix 现已成为官方 Ubuntu 衍生版。


解析：我应该使用哪个 Ubuntu 版本？

                              <span>这是一个新教程系列的开始。在这一篇中，你将熟悉 bash 脚本。


本系列假定你对 Linux 终端比较熟悉。你不必精通，但了解基础知识会很好。我建议阅读终端基础知识系列。

这个系列适合谁？

任何想开始学习 Bash Shell 脚本的人。

如果你是一名将 Shell 脚本作为课程的一部分的学生，那么本系列适合你。

如果你是普通的桌面 Linux 用户，本系列将帮助你了解在探索各种软件和修复程序时遇到的大多数 Shell 脚本。你还可以使用它来自动执行一些常见的重复性任务。

到本 Bash 基础系列结束时，你应该能够编写简单到中等水平的 Bash 脚本。

该系列的所有章节都有示例练习，你可以边做边学。


🚧 你将在这里学习 Bash Shell 脚本。虽然还有语法基本相同的其他 Shell，但它们的行为在某些方面仍然存在差异。Bash 是最常见和通用的 Shell，因此学习 Shell 脚本从 Bash 开始吧。


你的第一个 Shell 脚本：Hello World！

打开一个终端。现在 创建一个新目录 来保存你将在本系列中创建的所有脚本：

mkdir bash_scripts


现在 切换到这个新创建的目录：

cd bash_scripts


让我们在这里 创建一个新文件：

touch hello_world.sh


现在，编辑该文件 并向其中添加一行 echo Hello World。你可以使用 cat 命令的追加模式（使用 &gt;）执行此操作：

[abhishek@itsfoss]:~/bash_scripts$ cat &gt; hello_world.sh 
echo Hello World
^C


我更喜欢在使用 cat 命令添加文本时添加新行。

帕斯卡（Blaise Pascal）生于1623年6月19号，死于1662年8月19号，只活了三十九岁。十七世纪是所谓“天才的世纪”，弗朗西斯·培根死的时候，帕斯卡刚刚三岁；开普勒出版《世界的和谐》时，帕斯卡四岁；伽利略出版《两大世界的对话》时，帕斯卡九岁；霍布斯和伽利略在佛罗伦萨第一次见面时，帕斯卡大概十一岁。帕斯卡比他的法国同胞梅森（Marin Mersenne，1588生）、笛卡尔（1596生）、费马（1607生）以及英国人霍布斯（1588生）、意大利人托里拆利（1608生）晚一辈，又比牛顿（1642/1643生）和莱布尼兹（1646生）早一辈。和他同代的人有英格兰人沃里斯（1616生）和洛克（1632生）、荷兰人惠更斯（1629生），还有塞法迪犹太人斯宾诺莎（1632生）。1607年徐光启回上海老家守丧，三年后回京，利玛窦已逝，只翻译了六卷的《几何原本》就此搁置。徐光启死时，帕斯卡十岁。 
帕斯卡的父亲热爱数学和科学，在帕斯卡十一岁时去掉官职（一说卖掉一说让给弟弟），定居巴黎。帕父和神父出身的数学家梅森交好，梅森家是巴黎学者们聚会的沙龙，帕斯卡父子是常客。梅森府也被称为巴黎邮政局，因为他通过通信和欧洲的一百四十位数学家和科学家保持联系，研究成果到他这里汇总，再被他广播出去。梅森认为知识应该被广泛传播，这点和培根相似——中世纪教会保留的学术传统是知识应该保密，一元三次和四次方程的求解历史反映了当时数学家之间为了保密而引发的各种勾心斗角。梅森的通信网络也称“梅森学院”（Mersenne Academy），后来演变成非正式的“巴黎学院”，是法国科学院的前身。

帕斯卡有个姐姐吉尔伯特，比他大三岁。她非常疼爱自己天才的弟弟，在帕斯卡死的当年，写过一本五十页的帕斯卡传记《帕斯卡先生的一生》，她的孩子们也努力维护舅舅的名声。帕斯卡有个妹妹雅克琳，比…</span>

                              <span>仇恨的恶劣影响早已有之。但如今，新型通信技术进一步扩大了仇恨的规模和影响，发布仇恨言论已成为在全球范围内传播分裂言论和思想最常用的方法之一。6月18日是第二个打击仇恨言论国际日，联合国秘书长古特雷斯呼吁人们防止和消除这种破坏性的不良现象，促进包容、公正、和平的社区和社会。


古特雷斯表示，仇恨言论被用来煽动恐惧和分裂，往往是为了政治利益，给社区和社会带来巨大代价。仇恨言论煽动暴力，加剧紧张关系，阻碍促进调解和对话的努力。与此同时，仇恨言论还是种族灭绝和其他暴行罪的征兆之一。但在仇恨言论面前，我们远非无能为力。我们可以而且必须提高对其危险性的认识，并努力防止和消除所有形式的仇恨言论。


与此同时，古特雷斯对借口打击仇恨言论实则侵犯人权的行为发出警示。他指出，对仇恨言论错误和模棱两可的反应，包括全面禁止和关闭互联网，也可能因限制言论和表达自由而侵犯人权。他警告说，这甚至可能使一些最适合反击仇恨言论的人——人权维护者和记者保持沉默。


他指出，联合国正在就数字平台信息完整性自愿行为准则与各国政府、技术公司和其他方面进行磋商，以减少错误和虚假信息及仇恨言论的传播，同时保护表达自由。

AI 模型是建立在人类劳动的基础之上的，高质量的数据标注对 AI 模型至关重要，AI 公司通常会雇佣廉价的众包工人做一些数据标注工作。但研究显示，随着 AI 聊天机器人，如 ChatGPT 的流行，众包工人开始利用 AI 做这些数据标注的工作。瑞士洛桑联邦理工学院的研究人员招募了 44 名众包工人来对 16 篇医学研究论文总结摘要，根据记录的击键情况，比如按下复制快捷键等，他们估计有 33-46% 的摘要文本是用 AI 生成的。

老王点评：还记得前两天我们的#1032 期报道吗，显然这种 AI 吃 AI 的狗粮的事情已经在发生，并且会越来越多。而且，AI 真的能分清楚哪些是 AI 生成的么？可能会越来越难。




FreeBSD 本月庆祝其三十岁生日

1993 年 6 月 19 日，从 386BSD 项目中分裂出来的 FreeBSD 正式有了这个名字。但第一个正式版本直到 1993 年 11 月才发布。FreeBSD 14 将于未来几个月后发布，晚于预期计划。

老王点评：虽然不如 Linux 那么流行，但是 FreeBSD 仍然是一个独特而重要的操作系统。当然，这里面故事很多，感兴趣的朋友可以了解一下。




GPT-4 生成的商业计划书更受投资者青睐

虽然用 AI 撰写商业计划书能节约很多时间，但更重要的是，AI 撰写的比人类撰写的更好，更吸引投资。有公司邀请了数百名投资者和企业主对一组由人类创造和 GPT-4 生成的商业计划书进行评分，他们并不知道有 AI 参与撰写。而且，其中人类撰写的计划书来自于已经获得融资的成功案例。结果显示 GPT-4 生成的商业计划书比人类更有效，被认为在质量、关键要素描述和问题描述上胜过人类。调查显示，在投资者和企业主阅读了 GPT-4 的计划书之后，投资可能性为人类的三倍，他们认为 AI 生成计划书的说服力是人类的两倍。

                              <span>胡晓江（章静绘）

胡先骕（1894-1968）先生是中国植物学的奠基人，在中国近代科学史上具有重要地位，同时也是中国近代文学史上的重要人物，在新文化浪潮汹涌澎湃的年代，他始终坚持文化保守主义的立场，创作了大量诗词古文。此外，他还是一位教育家和有高度责任感的社会评论家。2023年5月24日，时值胡先骕一百三十岁虚岁诞辰，《胡先骕全集》在国家植物园举行了首发式。《全集》主编、北京师范大学教授胡晓江是胡先骕的孙女。在接受《上海书评》专访时，她讲述了《全集》的编纂过程，并对祖父胡先骕的生平及学术做了介绍。

《胡先骕全集》（共十九卷），江西人民出版社2023年5月版

能请您聊聊《胡先骕全集》的缘起吗？
胡晓江：《全集》是从2014年启动的。胡先骕是1894年生人，2014年是他的诞辰一百二十周年，江西师范大学举办了很大规模的“胡先骕教育思想研讨会”。江西师范大学是国立中正大学的“嫡传”，胡先骕是中正大学的首任校长。在会议期间有人提出，是时候为胡先骕编一部《全集》了。当然，这并非一时兴起，而是早已有了积累。对胡先骕有一点了解的人，都知道胡先骕不仅是一位科学家，还特别能写，他写诗、写文学批评、写社会评论，身后留下了很多文字。所以，对他的文章著作的搜集、整理，以及对他生平的研究，从上世纪八十年代就已经开始了。最早是中正大学在台湾的校友谭峙军先生，他对老校长念念不忘，晚年花了很多时间搜集、整理胡先骕发表在各处的诗词。在胡先骕百年诞辰的时候出版了《胡先骕先生诗集》（中正大学台湾校友会，1992年）。后来，胡先骕的另一位学生张大为和我的大伯父胡德熙、我父亲胡德焜一起，编了两卷本《胡先骕文存》（江西高校出版社，1995、1996年）。此外，学者胡宗刚在他担任研究员的庐山植物园发现了很多与胡先骕相关的档案资料，在此基础上做了很多研究，写了传记《不该遗忘的胡先骕》（长江文艺出版社，2005年），…</span>

去年 12 月刚刚换了工作用的笔记本电脑后，我意识到我有多么喜欢给我的工作设备贴贴纸。这些贴纸有些是过去活动的纪念品，有些是我热衷的项目的标志，还有一些则只是为了好玩！

因为好奇别人的笔记本上贴了什么，我对周围的同事朋友问了一圈。

无障碍倡导者



这是我的工作笔记本电脑（你能看出我对 Drupal 的热爱吗）。我最喜欢的贴纸是有轮椅的 Druplicon... 当 Drupal 8 发布时，我们把这个标志 和轮椅结合在一起，因为我所在的机构专注于无障碍性。

— AmyJune Hineline

充满活力的 Java



自从我还是个孩子的时候，我的电脑和其他东西上就一直有贴纸。我认为我最喜欢的要么是 “Tux”，要么是 “Linux Inside”。它们大多与领域相关，只有一些不相关的。在右下角，我有一个运行在“汤姆猫”上的 Java 贴纸（哈哈）- 这是我职业生涯中花费大部分时间的领域。

— Alan Formy-Duval

实用目的



嗯，我没有贴任何贴纸。然而，我在我的两台笔记本电脑上粘了绒面条，用来固定我的移动硬盘，这样我在公交车上玩游戏时就不会掉落了。我还粘了一个锁槽。

— Rikard Grossman-Nielsen

保持外观



虽然这不是最装饰得最多的笔记本电脑，但我喜欢这套集合（你知道的，很难在没有旅行的情况下获得更多！）

我最喜欢的是“最后一个提交的人是维护者”。这是对维护状态的讽刺性评论，也承诺代码将因此而继续存在。

主要是关于我使用或贡献的事物，我认为有意义，或者只是觉得这个贴纸很棒。

这个名为 Tunnel Falls 的处理器是一款 12 量子比特的芯片，虽然远远落后于英特尔的许多竞争对手的量子比特数量，但英特尔正试图建立基于硅的量子比特，而其它的量子处理器厂商都在通过云服务提供量子处理器。这些量子比特基于“量子点”，这些结构比材料中的电子波长还要小。量子点可以用来捕获单个电子，然后可以处理电子的特性来存储量子信息。英特尔利用其制造专长来制作量子点，并创造出设置和读取其状态以及执行操作所需的所有邻近功能。

谷歌利用 YouTube 开发其下一代人工智能

据透露，谷歌的研究人员一直在利用 YouTube 开发其下一个大型语言模型 “双子座Gemini”，该模型展示了在其他任何模型中都看不到的多模态能力。而 OpenAI 也已经秘密地使用了 YouTube 的数据来训练其一些人工智能模型，但谷歌能够拥有 YouTube 更全面的视频数据。人工智能开发者在寻找用于训练和改进模型的高质量数据方面面临着新的障碍。从 Reddit 到 Stack Exchange 再到 DeviantArt 的主要网站出版商正越来越多地阻止开发者为该目的下载数据。


消息来源：The Information



老王点评：人工智能下面一个竞争优势就是，看谁拥有大量的数据。所以，我有点明白 Reddit、Twitter 为什么要对其 API 收高价了，可能广告的流失可能并不是主要的原因，因为这种情况并不是第一天存在了。




Meta 公司希望人们能利用其开源人工智能赚钱

Meta 公司正在研究如何将其开源的大语言模型的下一个版本用于商业用途，他们希望其他公司自由使用 Meta 正在开发的新人工智能软件并从中获利，这一决定可能会对其他人工智能开发者和越来越多地采用它的企业产生重大影响。随着开发者采用和改进这些 Meta 开源的模型或修补其安全漏洞，Meta 也将能够把这些改进纳入其自己的消费者和广告产品的人工智能模型中。


消息来源：The Information



老王点评：Meta 公司显然是走一条弯道超车的方法，走开源的路，让其它人无路可走。</span>

                              <span>软件自由保护协会Software Freedom Conservancy（SFC）是一家由开源倡导者组成的非营利性社区。今天（本文原文发表于 2022 年 7 月 5 日），它发布了一篇抨击性的博文，宣布退出 GitHub，并请求其成员及支持者公开谴责该平台。SFC 与 GitHub 的如此纷争，源于这一颇受指责的举动：微软和 OpenAI 训练了一个名为 Copilot 的 AI 系统，而其训练数据的来源，是那些使用了开源许可证公开的代码。开源代码不是捐款箱，不是想拿多少就拿多少，想怎么用就怎么用的。

它更像是摄影作品。即便摄影师没有向你收取照片的使用费，你仍需要在该署名的地方进行署上来源。据 SFC 的一篇 博文 所述，Copilot 在使用他人的代码片段时，并没有保留来源信息：

“这反映了 GitHub 长期以来的问题，也是我们必须一齐放弃 GitHub 的关键原因。从 Copilot 中，从 GitHub 的代码托管服务中，从我们所见的基本每个领域，我们都发现 GitHub 的行为比其同行要差得多。我们也不相信 Amazon、Atlassian、GitLab 等其他盈利性的代码托管平台，能有杰出的表现。然而，将 GitHub 的行为与其同行相对比较一下，就能发现 GitHub 的行为要差得多了。”

GitHub 是全世界事实上的开源代码仓库。它是 YouTube、Twitter 和 Reddit 的混合体，但专为程序员及其代码服务。自然，替代品是有的。但是，从一个代码仓库生态切换到另一个，并不等同于用 Instagram 来替代 TikTok。微软在 2018 年花了 70 多亿美元来收购 GitHub。从那时起，微软就利用其 OpenAI 的主要受益者的地位，来共同开发 Copilot。并且，要访问 Copilot 服务，只能通过微软的特别邀请，或者支付订阅费。该举激怒了 SFC 及其他开源倡导者，因为微软和 OpenAI 实际上在将他人的代码货币化，同时让使用这些代码的人们不能正确地表明归属信息。

Copilot 必须毁灭。或者，微软和 OpenAI 可以造一台时光机，然后穿越到过去，将 Copilot 数据库中的每一点数据做标记，从而能够为所有输出提供正确的署名。但是，与其去关心你产品或者服务中的伦理问题，不如去鼓动人们，去开拓那荒野西部似的监管环境，后者总是更加简单的。

                              <span>pipx 解决了流行的 pip 工具的不足之处。学习在 Linux 中安装和使用 pipx。


pip 是一种流行的工具，用于从 Python 包索引 中安装 Python 包和模块。

然而，在最近的发行版本中，pip 用户遇到了 外部管理环境错误。



这是为避免通过 pip 安装的 Python 包与本机包管理器之间发生冲突而添加的“功能”。Python 希望你使用单独的虚拟环境，而不是通过 pip 在全局安装包。

这就是 pipx 发挥作用的地方。它为你安装的每个应用创建一个新的虚拟环境，然后在全局级别的 /bin 中创建到本地二进制文件的链接。这一切都是自动的。它为你节省时间和精力。

让我们看看如何在 Ubuntu 和其他 Linux 发行版上安装和使用 pipx。

在 Ubuntu 和其他 Linux 上安装 pipx

安装很简单，可以在 Ubuntu 和 Debian 上使用以下命令安装：

sudo apt update &amp;&amp; sudo apt install pipx


对于其他发行版，请使用你的包管理器并安装它。

完成安装后，将其添加到 $PATH 以便可以从任何地方访问它：

pipx ensurepath




关闭终端并重新启动它。这就完成了！ 现在，让我们看看如何使用它。

使用 pipx

包管理器的主要用途是什么？ 软件包安装、更新和删除。

让我向你展示如何使用 pipx 执行以下操作：


搜索包

包安装

升级

包移除


让我们从安装开始。

如何使用 pipx 安装包

要使用 pipx 安装包，你必须遵循一个简单的命令语法：

pipx install 



例如，在这里，我安装了一个非常有用的程序 Cowsay：

pipx install cowsay




同样，如果你想安装特定版本的包，你必须在 &#x3D;&#x3D; 后跟上版本号，如下所示：

pipx install package&#x3D;&#x3D;version


例如，在这里，我安装了 1.24.1 版本的 numpy：

pipx install numpy&#x3D;&#x3D;1.24.1




如何搜索包

pipx 程序没有搜索功能（因为 PyPI 的 API 使用限制）但这并不意味着你不能搜索 Python 包。

要搜索包，你需要安装 pypisearch：

pipx install pypisearch


完成后，你可以使用 pypisearch 命令搜索包：

pypisearch python_package_name


在这里，我搜索了 neofetch：



如何使用 pipx 升级包

与任何其他现代包管理器一样，你可以一次升级所有包，也可以一次升级一个包。

要一次升级所有软件包，你只需执行以下命令：

pipx upgrade-all




如你所见，它将 numpy 升级到最新版本。

但是如果你想升级一个特定的包，你可以这样做：

pipx upgrade package-name


假设我想将 cowsay 包升级到最新版本，那么，我将使用以下命令：

pipx upgrade cowsay




如何使用 pipx 卸载包

要删除包，你必须使用 uninstall 标志，如下所示：

pipx uninstall package_name


为了供你参考，在这里，我从我的系统中删除了 numpy：

pipx uninstall numpy




pip 还是 pipx？

对 pip 的限制影响了最终用户对它的使用。值得庆幸的是，pipx 提供了急需的替代方案。它符合使用虚拟环境的 Python 准则，同时允许已安装的应用在全局范围内可用。

对于不是 Python 应用开发的最终用户，这提供了使用发行版仓库中不可用的 Python 应用的选项。

希望本教程对你有所帮助。如果你有任何问题或建议，请告诉我。

                        <a class="article-summary-link article-summary-box-outer" href="https://www.williamlong.info/archives/7199.html">
                          <div class="article-summary-box-inner media-object">
                            <span class="media-object__text">
                              <span>昆汀·塔伦蒂诺（Quentin Tarantino），1963年3月27日生于美国田纳西州的挪克斯维尔，美国导演、编剧、演员、制作人。他电影的特色为非线性叙事的剧情、讽刺题材、暴力美学、架空历史以及新黑色电影的风格。有人曾说，近二十年内，对当代好莱坞影响最大的三位导演，当属昆汀·塔伦蒂诺、詹姆斯·卡梅隆和克里斯托弗·诺兰。


昆汀·塔伦蒂诺的电影叫好又叫座。他曾获得多项大奖，其中包括两座奥斯卡金像奖、四座金球奖、两座英国电影学院奖和金棕榈奖，并还提名过黄金时段艾美奖与格莱美奖。他受《时代杂志》于2005年评为“全球100名最具影响力的人物”。影评人及历史学家彼得·博格丹诺维奇也曾称他为“在他那世代中最有影响力的导演”。


昆汀曾说，自己这一生只拍十部电影，拍完就金盆洗手。昆汀自29岁开始执导第一部长片电影，27年间，由昆汀独立完成的有九部电影，每部都是经典之作，可以说，从未失手。


下面我们就盘点一下昆汀的这九部电影。


《落水狗》


这部电影是塔伦蒂诺的处女作，展现了他独特的对话风格，黑色幽默，暴力美学和非线性叙事。影片开头就是大段话唠，几个人的个性鲜明，故事讲述了一群不知道彼此真实身份的劫匪在一次抢劫珠宝店的过程中遭遇了警方的埋伏，随后在一个仓库里相互怀疑，想要揪出卧底的故事。很想知道，最后卧底告诉白先生自己是警察后，白先生的心理阴影。





《低俗小说》


影片情节跌宕起伏，剧情引人入胜，人物形象特色分明，叙事和拍摄手法非常独特，剧情的切换幅度很大。“低俗”的内容充斥着影片：性、毒品、暴力、杀人、抢劫、黑帮等等，人物形象特色分明，长得都很有喜感，演员表演也很经典，风情万种的蜜尔（很正点），备受老大女人诱惑的文森（风流倜傥，死的很冤），“放下屠刀，立地成佛”的黑人杀手朱思（从杀手到哲学家），倒霉的黑帮老大（暴菊黑屋子的剧情太搞了），优雅处事且老道的沃夫先生（专门帮忙解决麻烦），在餐馆抢劫的搞笑男女劫匪（笨贼一箩筐）。布鲁斯·威利斯竟然在里面做配角拳击手，实在浪费。拳击手的女友娇小柔弱，和彪悍的拳击手配在一起真绝了。 





《危险关系》


这部片大概是昆汀·塔伦蒂诺电影里知名度最低的之一，感觉女主角选的不好，让人没啥印象（可能主要原因是不好看），女配角的命运还真惨，莫名其妙就当了枪下亡魂。





《杀死比尔》


影片讲述了女主角在自己的婚礼上遭到了前任恋人“比尔”和他的杀手团队的袭击，陷入了昏迷四年的状态，醒来后决心报复的故事。画面血腥，昆汀暴力美学的经典之作。





《金刚不坏》


讲述了一个变态杀手驾驶着一辆改装过的汽车，专门追杀年轻女子的故事。这部B级片相对昆汀的其他作品来说并不出众，话唠的内容不如《低俗小说》，血腥的内容不如《杀死比尔》，前半部分使用胶片电影滤镜，很有胶片感，影片依旧是暴力、血腥，影片中间的一段舞曲《Down in Mexico》令人印象深刻，明确表明昆汀依旧恋足。





《无耻混蛋》


美丽少女苏珊娜的悲惨身世颇令人同情，她身负灭门的血海深仇，每一天都活在复仇的回忆中，她面对德军的勇气，谋划复仇计划的谋略也令人佩服和欣赏，然而，导演不会给观众一段《基督山复仇记》一般的完美情节，在最后计划几乎已经快要实施成功的时候，用一段教课书式的“暴力美学”结束了少女的生命，令人唏嘘不已。 看过这片子后，感觉很纠结。影片看起来感觉很爽，又有些感觉不爽，影片好像挺文雅，但似乎又好像挺流氓，影片似乎是抗德神剧，但似乎又有哪里不对。 不用纠结了，昆汀·塔伦蒂诺的神剧，看就是了。





《被解救的姜戈》


影片讲述了一位名叫姜戈的黑人奴隶，在一位白人赏金猎人的帮助下获得了自由并解救自己的妻子的故事。克里斯托弗·瓦尔兹扮演的赏金猎人令人印象深刻，他处决治安官那段剧情简直令人拍手叫绝。





《八恶人》


剧情发生在南北战争结束后不久，八个陌生人因为暴风雪而被困在一间客栈，每个人都隐藏着不同的秘密和目的，而这间客栈也成为了一座充满死亡和血腥的战场。《八恶人》和《龙门客栈》有很多相似之处，都是在客栈等候并伏击押送的犯人，都有一扇被反复踹开的门，一个是在酒里下毒，一个是在咖啡下毒，不同的是，本片有大量昆汀风格的话痨、血浆以及爆蛋。





《好莱坞往事》


这部电影对观众的要求很高，观众如果不知道1969年轰动洛杉矶的“曼森杀人案”的详细经过，以及嬉皮士运动的历史，那么看这部电影一定是莫名其妙一头雾水，心里想着，这导演拍的什么玩意儿。为了不影响观影效果，建议看前先了解一下“曼森杀人案”的背景和经过。</span>

                              <span>The bcachefs filesystem, and the
process for getting it upstream, were the topics
of a session led remotely by 
Kent Overstreet, creator of bcachefs, at the 
2023 Linux Storage, Filesystem,
Memory-Management and BPF Summit.  He has also discussed bcachefs in
previous editions of the summit, first
in 2018 and at last year&#x27;s event;
in both of those cases, the question of getting bcachefs merged
into the mainline kernel came up, but that merge has not happened yet.
This time 
around, though, Overstreet seemed 
closer than ever to being ready to actually start that process.</span>

                              <span>据澎湃新闻援引据路透报道，当地时间6月15日，电商巨头阿里巴巴集团总裁迈克尔·埃文斯（J． Michael Evans）表示，阿里集团专注于在中国境外建立本地业务和在线平台，将把欧洲地区放在发展首位。


当被问及阿里巴巴创始人马云的近况时，埃文斯表示，“马云现在对这家公司的关心程度与他刚创立公司时一样，我预计只要阿里巴巴和马云还在，这种情况就会持续下去。”


“Jack（马云）很有活力，他很好，他很开心。他正在东京的一所大学教书，并且有更多时间待在中国。”埃文斯表示。


东京大学官网信息显示，马云已经被聘任为东京大学教授（客座教授），在留时间为2023年5月1日-2023年10月31日。


据了解，马云将从事的领域包括就重要的研究主题提供建议，以及就管理和创业开办讲座。


另据一位微博博主的爆料，6月12日晚，东京学院与东京大学全球领导力项目（GLP）推广办公室合作，举办了一场关于创新和创业的特别研讨会。


该研讨会主要针对GLP-GEfIL学生在国际社会中培养领导才能的问题，由客座教授马云主持，教室里坐满了代表日本、中国、印度和马来西亚等多元化和全球化的学生。


据悉，讲座以马云的丰富经验和开拓创新的知识为基础，重点介绍了他对年轻一代的启示，包括他的管理理念和如何吸引未来，之后，在场的学生从不同角度提出了一系列尖锐的问题，与马云客座教授进行了热烈的交流。

                              <span>Reddit 威胁换掉继续抗议的子区管理员

本周初，数千 Reddit 子区 闭版 以抗议 Reddit API 的天价收费，因为这事实上扼杀了管理员们赖以执行管理操作的第三方客户端。Reddit CEO 对员工 表示 不要担心，因为抗议不会影响公司收入。他称，“大部分子区会按计划在周三回归，我们干好自己的工作就行了”。周三，部分子区陆续恢复，但也有很多子区将继续保持关闭 —— 直到 Reddit 改变其政策。目前还有超过一半的子区保持关闭或限制，这包括订阅数超过四千万的 r/funny、超过三千万的 r/aww、r/Music 等。此外，Reddit 还威胁将移除继续抗议的管理员。Reddit 宣称，如果一个子区的管理团队一致同意停止管理社区，它将邀请愿意管理社区的新管理员来管理社区；而如果至少有一名管理员愿意维持社区运作，Reddit 将移除不想管理社区的管理员。

老王点评：真是要硬扛到底啊，这不是移除几个“刺头”管理员就能解决问题的，相信这样的抗议也代表了大部分社区中坚的意见。无论如何，这都是一幕罕见的大规模社区对抗事件，让我们拭目以待。




YouTube 通知其开源替代品 Invidious 关闭

Invidious 是 YouTube 的一个开源 “替代前端”，允许用户在没有数据跟踪的情况下观看 YouTube 视频，也可以让用户在观看视频时不被 “恼人的广告” 打断。YouTube 声称该软件违反了其 API 政策，称它没有显示 YouTube 服务条款的链接，也没有 “明确” 解释其对用户信息的处理。YouTube 要求它在 7 天内关闭。


消息来源：VICE



老王点评：看来开放 API 将全面进入关闭时代，各个网站都开始扼杀这些妨碍其广告业务的客户端了。或许在官方看来，这些利用其 API 的第三方客户端就是在对它们吸血。




Alphabet 出售了谷歌域名产品

Alphabet 正在结束其谷歌域名业务，并将其资产以约 1.8 亿美元的价格出售给 SquareSpace。这些资产包括“在谷歌域名业务上托管的 1000 万个域名，分布在数百万个客户中”。谷歌域名业务于 2014 年推出，在 2022 年退出了测试阶段。它拥有诸多新的顶级域名，是 HTTPS 的主要支持者之一。

                              <span>在 Linux 中无法打开 AVIF 图片？AVIF 是一种新的网络图像文件格式，下面是在 Linux 桌面上查看 AVIF 图像的方法。


就质量而言，PNG 是最好的，但它们体积庞大，因此不适合用于网站。

JPEG 会减小文件大小，但会显着降低图像质量。

WebP 是一种相对较新的格式，可以生成尺寸更小、质量更好的图像。

现在，AVIF 是一种新的文件格式，可以在不牺牲质量的情况下压缩图像。对于相同的图像质量，它们比 WebP 更小。

最近 Linux 已开始提供 WebP 支持。但是，许多发行版默认不支持 AVIF 图像格式。

如果你从网络上下载 AVIF 格式的图像，它不会显示缩略图。



如果你尝试使用默认图像查看器打开它，它很可能会显示“无法识别的图像文件格式”错误。



那么，解决方案是什么？ 在 Linux 上根本看不了 AVIF 图像吗？

不，事实并非如此。对于 Linux，总有一种解决方法。

在 Linux 中查看 AVIF 图像文件

有一个名为 gThumb 的便捷 图像查看器，可用于在 Linux 上打开 AVIF 图像。

如果不是全部的话，它应该在大多数 Linux 发行版的仓库中可用。

在 Ubuntu 和基于 Debian 的发行版上，使用以下命令安装 gThumb。

sudo apt install gthumb




安装后，选择一张 AVIF 图像，右键单击它并选择“打开方式Open With”选项。在这里，选择 gThumb，将其设为 AVIF 图像的默认值并打开它。



gThumb 在打开的图像下以缩略图格式显示同一文件夹中的所有图像。



使用 gThumb 打开 AVIF 图像后，它们也应该以缩略图显示。



就是这样。你现在可以在 Linux 桌面上欣赏 AVIF 图像。

总结

gThumb 是一个用途极为广泛且功能强大的应用。这让我想知道为什么它不被用作 GNOME 或其他桌面环境和发行版中的默认图像查看器。

关于 Linux 中默认的 AVIF 支持，迟早会添加。目前，gThumb 完成了这项工作。

                              <span>我们将介绍一些最佳的虚拟化程序，为用户创建/管理虚拟机提供便利。


虚拟化软件由于其用途和好处而广泛使用，你可以使用它来体验、测试或运行需要特定操作系统版本的软件。

虚拟化提供了一个抽象的计算机硬件概念，帮助你创建虚拟机（VM）、网络、存储等。其好处包括隔离性、安全性和自由度高，可以尽情测试各种事物。

不同类型的虚拟化软件分别适用于桌面用户、服务器管理员和企业用户。

在列出各种虚拟化软件的同时，我还会提到适用对象。

1、VirtualBox



VirtualBox 是一款备受赞誉的开源虚拟机程序，适用于 Linux、Windows 和 macOS。

它适用于各种类型的用户，无论你只是想在虚拟机上运行 Linux，还是想创建一个用于测试的虚拟机，或者是企业需要一个虚拟机解决方案。

对大多数用户来说，它可以被视为一个全能解决方案。虽然它主要适用于桌面使用，但你可以尝试其无头headless模式，通过查阅其 文档，将虚拟机作为远程桌面服务器运行。

主要亮点：


支持广泛的客户操作系统

简单的用户界面和快速的性能

定期更新

功能丰富


2、OpenVZ



想在服务器上创建隔离的 Linux 容器吗？OpenVZ 可以帮助你。

你可以创建行为类似于独立服务器的容器。这些容器具备帮助你高效管理的所有基本功能。

由于 OpenVZ 是作为 Linux 发行版构建和分发的，因此容器仅运行于 Linux 上。

对于初学者来说，OpenVZ 是学习使用容器的绝佳选择，因为它易于配置和管理。此外，与其他一些方案相比，基于 OpenVZ 的 VPS 托管价格实惠。

主要亮点：


资源利用效率高

使用和管理简单

任何一个转弯都可能引向天堂
或者，任何角落都可能隐藏着地狱
道路闪亮，像雨后上山的河流。
——爱德华·托马斯
1914年12月至1917年1月，在战争的阴霾下，爱德华·托马斯（Edward Thomas）用生命的最后两年时间创作了他一生的诗篇。1917年1月13日，托马斯写下最后一首诗《真爱的悲哀》，两周后，他作为英国皇家炮兵部队少尉赴法国前线。4月9日，在阿拉斯（Arras）“复活节反攻”时被德军炮弹击中身亡。托马斯的一百四十二首诗作在其身后结集出版，被认为是那个时代最伟大的诗歌成就之一。作为十六位战争诗人之一，他的名字被镌刻在伦敦西敏寺诗人角的一块纪念碑上。
爱德华·托马斯生于1878年，十九岁出版第一本散文集《林地生活》。到1914年，在成为诗人之前，他已是著名散文家、传记作家和深具影响力的文学批评家，被《泰晤士报》称为“拥有英格兰诗歌天堂钥匙的人”。那一时期，托马斯还实验性地创作了冥想散文、印象派小说、神话、奇幻故事与寓言，他的写作实践几乎涵盖了所有的文学体裁，如果不是过人的文学禀赋，他或许也会以纯粹的博物学家、自然学家、地形学家、民俗学家或社会历史学家的身份来写作。托马斯广泛而独到的评论遍及自乔叟时代到他同时代的文学作品，既以非凡的洞察力评论同时代作家（哈代、叶芝、劳伦斯、庞德等），也敏锐地倾注于当时名不见经传的文学新人。他第一个意识到威廉·亨利·戴维斯（W. H. Davies）、德拉梅尔（Walter de la Mare）和弗罗斯特的诗歌才华。他积极评价戴维斯的处女作，并鼓励他写下在北美的狂野经历《一个超级流浪汉的自传》，这本书被出版商拒绝，托马斯帮助获得萧伯纳的前言，助力出版；托马斯在评论弗罗斯特的《波士顿以北》…</span>

                              <span>The C language does not provide the sort of resource-management features
found in more recent languages.  As a result, bugs involving
leaked memory or failure to release a lock are relatively common in
programs written in C — including the kernel.  The kernel project has never
limited itself to the language features found in the C standard, though;
kernel developers will happily
use extensions provided by compilers if they prove helpful.  It looks like
a relatively simple compiler-provided feature may lead to a significant
change in some common kernel coding patterns.</span>

                              <span>Darrick Wong has been doing work on XFS online
repair for a number of years 
and things are getting to the point where most of the filesystem-internal work
has been completed and is under review.  The work remaining mostly concerns
the user-space side 
to set up a periodic scan and repair cycle, so he wanted to discuss what
user space needs from this kind of feature in a filesystem session at the 
2023 Linux Storage, Filesystem,
Memory-Management and BPF Summit that he led remotely.  The session may
not have gone quite as he hoped, as it got somewhat derailed by topics that
spilled over from the earlier session on
unprivileged image mounts.</span>

安卓开源项目（AOSP）是安卓系统开源的部分，但谷歌不断地将其中一些部分抽取到其私有的谷歌服务框架。最近，谷歌又废弃了 AOSP 中的拨号和消息应用程序，谷歌称，“这个应用程序没有得到积极的支持，其源代码只作为参考。这个项目将在未来的某个时候从源代码清单中删除。”虽然每个安卓 OEM 厂商都已经使用了他们自己的拨号和消息应用，而且也有比谷歌更好的开源替代品，但对于安卓这个开源操作系统来说，由于 AOSP 的功能不断地被转移到闭源的谷歌服务框架中，你将不能说 AOSP 是一个完整的开源移动操作系统了。

老王点评：从谷歌删除“不作恶”信条那时起，开源就不断被它践踏。当然，这并不是谷歌做的有多差，或者违背了开源许可证，在这方面比它差的比比皆是。叹息的是，终究很多公司只是将开源当成一件需要利用时披上的华丽衣服，而在金钱当道时就如旧衣一样丢弃。




Debian 13 将支持 RISC-V 64

Debian 12 已经正式发布，官方支持 AMD64、AArch64、i386、POWER 等架构，但不支持 RISC-V 64 位。不过，对 RISC-V 64 位的移植正在取得良好的进展。在一年半到两年后的 Debian 13 版本中，预计会有对 RISC-V 64 位的支持。考虑到许多社区开源开发者缺乏高性能 RISC-V 硬件，这也是可以理解的。


消息来源：Phoronix



老王点评：如果 Debian 能够支持高性能 RISC-V 架构，将从根本上推动 RISC-V 的发展。




生成型人工智能每年可为全球经济增加 4.4 万亿美元

麦肯锡公司称，生成性人工智能每年可为全球经济增加 “2.6 万亿至 4.4 万亿美元”。这几乎是 “相当于在地球上增加一个规模相当于英国的新国家（其 2021 年 GDP 为 3.1 万亿美元）”。这一数据比该公司在 2017 年的预估上调了 15% 至 40%。生成性人工智能和其他技术有可能使工作自动化，但麦肯锡认为这并不意味着大规模的工作流失，而是“使这些工作的执行速度大大加快”。麦肯锡发现，主要受到影响的工作任务是客户运营、市场和销售、软件工程和研发等工作。

老王点评：虽然如此说，但是一些人失业是不可避免的，就看谁能适应。可以预期的是，人工智能鸿沟会进一步拉大社会差距。

                              <span>与你最亲近的人建立一种开放的文化，并带着它走遍天下。


作为 80 年代的叛逆少年，“因为我这么说”是我在家里经常听到的一句话。我并不是一个真正的叛逆者。我只是想让别人听到我的声音，把我看成是一个开始表达自己想法和情感的人。

我那种不被倾听/聆听的感觉让我相信，培养不害怕说话的孩子很重要，但他们也能学会适应。倾听他们的意见，与孩子们合作，也可以帮助他们发挥创造力，最终让他们成为成功组织的一部分。

孩子们如何解释信息

我并没有刻意鼓励孩子们的开放行为，也没有主动告诉孩子们要大声说话。尽管如此，在我大儿子上幼儿园的第一天，他的老师给我们打电话。她告诉我们，当她和全班同学一起讨论不打架、不推搡等规则时，我的孩子举手告诉她，他的父母允许他一直争论和辩论。

这是真的。我让我的孩子们表达自己的意见，并让他们听到。但我孩子的话让我感到惊讶。直到那时我才意识到，虽然我一直在做正确的事情，但事实上，我的孩子们的行为不应该只是对我们教育他们的方式的反应。我们也不应该让他们从二手语境中挑选东西。那一天对我来说是一个游戏规则的改变，践行开放的文化正式主动地进入我们的家庭。

为成长而开放

在我小的时候，父母和长辈是有知识的人。

作为一个孩子，要获得信息并不容易。虽然我被鼓励表达意见，但也只是到了一个规范的、“容易消化”的程度。今天，父母、老师和孩子都有同样的手段来获取数据。你如何处理它，完全取决于你。

例如，在用希伯来语玩 Scattergories 时，“病毒”一词通常是大多数人玩的唯一以 “V” 开头的生物。为了获得更多的分数，我们决定寻找其他符合条件的动物名称。不一会儿，我们就找到了不是一种而是三种新的生物（我孩子的老师认为“小袋鼠”（希伯来语中以 “V” 拼写）不是一种真实的东西，但这是另一个故事）。

我教我的孩子阅读字里行间的内容，决不要不加质疑地接受作为“事实”呈现给他们的东西。这使他们能够练习批判性思维。这也使他们能够质疑我，从而使我们进行公开和透明的讨论。

这些讨论容易吗？不是。我总是有精力进行这些讨论吗？绝对不是。

然而，为了帮助他们练习学会倾听的“肌肉”，这些对话是必须的。

偶尔，我们必须强迫自己找到时间，把注意力集中在家庭上。建立一个强大而开放的文化需要时间，随着人们的变化，你的家庭文化也在变化。你必须适应并努力保持它的活力。作为群体的领导者，我必须为我的孩子们提供一个安全的地方，一个他们可以公开分享自己想法的地方，一个他们有归属感的地方。

在一个家庭中，你们必须合作，共同解决问题。倾听不同的想法和解决问题的方法可以让你想出创造性的（但并不总是符合每个人的喜好）解决方案。

我家里的一个问题是玩电脑游戏时家里的噪音。这种情况大多发生在深夜和周末。我们一起坐下来，想出了一个商定的嘈杂游戏的时间段。从那时起，那些想玩的人知道他们什么时候可以玩，而那些寻求一些安静时间的人也知道这些时间会发生什么。随着孩子们的长大，决定和讨论的性质也发生了变化。

这是否意味着所有的决定都与孩子们分享？不。这是否意味着都是玫瑰花？绝对不是。

鼓励孩子们建立联系可能会以一个破花瓶告终，似乎没有人对此负责。这可能会导致“因为我这么说”来拜访。然而，进行具有挑战性但又具有包容性的对话、鼓励创新思维以及让孩子参与决策都是让他们为成年做好准备的方法。希望它也能让他们成为更好的人（到目前为止，以我的拙见，这运作良好）。

开放的家庭文化

实行开放的文化不是一次性的事情。它是一个旅程，也是一种心态。我相信它为我和我的孩子们提供了工具，使他们在屋内和屋外都能坚韧不拔、思想开放、宽容和充满好奇心。与你最亲近的人建立一种开放的文化，并带着它走遍天下。

                              <span>在 Rust 系列的 上一篇文章 中，我介绍了如何使用 if 和 else 关键字来处理 Rust 程序的控制流。

这是处理程序控制流的一种方法。另一种方法是使用循环。因此，让我们在本文中看看循环。

Rust 中可用的循环

Rust 编程语言有三种不同的循环，基于你想要实现什么以及可用的内容：


for

while

loop


我假设你对 for 和 while 已经很熟悉了，但 loop 对你来说可能是个新概念。让我们先从熟悉的概念开始。

for 循环

for 循环主要用于迭代一种称为迭代器的东西。

这个迭代器可以从任何东西中创建，从数组、向量（很快就会介绍！）、一系列值，或者任何自定义的东西。这里的可能性是无限的。

来看看 for 循环的语法。

for 迭代变量 in 迭代器 {
    ;
}


其中的 迭代变量 在大多数其他编程语言教程中通常被称为 i ; )

迭代器 可以是任何东西，只要它能告诉下一个值是什么，如果有的话。

来通过一个程序来理解这个。

fn main() {
    let my_arr &#x3D; [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9];

    println!(&quot;迭代数组&quot;);
    for element in my_arr {
        println!(&quot;{}&quot;, element);
    }

    println!(&quot;\n迭代一个真正的迭代器&quot;);
    for element in my_arr.iter() {
        println!(&quot;{}&quot;, element);
    }

    println!(&quot;\nPython 风格的范围&quot;);
    for element in …</span>

东南亚华人华侨的历史久为学界关注，从最早的经济行为入手，继而政治意义、文化衍变传承以及身份认同等各方面都有了优秀的专著和研究文章。并且，在“南洋”这个大的地域概念之下，逐渐细分出不同国家/地区华人华侨在历史上的差异化发展沿革。比如笔者博士求学期间主要研究的新加坡/马来亚华人华侨，和工作后所在泰国的华人华侨，不论是早期华侨时代还是演变至今的华人华裔，都呈现出迥异的生存状态以及认同。李欣祥先生这本《消逝的海外华邦：西婆罗洲华人政权的兴亡》从兰芳公司（1770-1884）这个领域内都有所耳闻的“华人海外共和国”入手，对西婆罗洲曾存在过若干华人政权的缘起、发展和灭亡做了详细的介绍与分析，并试图讨论这些政权尤其是兰芳公司在整个华人历史中可能扮演过的重要且独特的先驱角色（兰芳公司的名称之争历来已久，本文采纳李欣祥先生在书中的叫法，写作兰芳公司）。由于西婆罗洲现今华人群体式微，相关的研究工作不曾大规模开展过，而李欣祥先生将他之前的累积做了一个更有深度和广度的延伸，把西婆罗洲存在过的华人公司作为整体研究对象撰写了《消逝的海外华邦》，为那段西婆罗洲华人公司及政权的历史刻下了重要的印记。
公司（kongsi）还是共和国——如何定义西婆罗洲的华人政权
作者给这本书的题目起得很巧妙，用了“华邦”这个词，因为对兰芳公司的定性几十年来一直有所争议。以荷兰学者高延为代表的一部分学者认为，兰芳公司的领袖大统制角色近乎共和政体下的总统，甚至发展出自己类似议会的议政制度，加上拥有武装力量、税收政策以及对外关系，尤其当时的清政府并没有承认和兰芳的从属关系，完全可以被视作一个独立的国家，所以兰芳公司当之无愧可以被称为“兰芳共和国”。但还有一部分学者认为，兰芳公司并没有脱离东南亚华人群体中“公司（ko…</span>

乔治·杜比（Georges Duby ）等主编的《女性史·20世纪卷》（原书名A History of Women in the West, Volume V : Toward a Cultural Identity in the Twentieth Century，1992）虽然是三十年前出版的著作，但是我认为在关于二十世纪女性史的研究中该书至今仍然具有重要的权威性，其敏锐的问题意识和开阔的研究视角及方法远未过时。进入二十一世纪以来的性别史、妇女史以及在各种历史研究议题中性别研究视角的研究成果无疑非常丰富，但是在通史、国别史、全球史、跨国史比较研究等整体性层面上的女性研究地位仍远未取得转向性的成果。仅此而言，可以说在历史学科的整体性建构中仍有亟需填补的空缺，而《女性史》在整体性历史研究的面向中，其性别化的研究视角和以性别体系为中心的强调差异性、动态性的方法论无疑仍然具有开拓性的意义。更重要的是在有关二十世纪的女性史叙事中，该书从不同视角揭露了存在于所有社会结构中的性别权力压迫的普遍性，也揭示了在国家主义、民族主义等意识形态制约下的民族国家建构中的性别压迫的复杂性和微观过程。同时，作者们以大量史实和性别理论阐释提醒人们反思和警惕所谓二十世纪的女性故事在本质上是一个进步故事、二十世纪是女性进步时代的断言。该书通过整体性的历史研究揭露和反抗一切性别权力压迫，使女性史研究成为审视历史、理解现实和面向未来的一种有效的方式，我认为是这本女性主义历史叙事著作最值得阅读的理由。

                              <span>从小冰官方公众号获悉，今日小冰公司与网易云音乐宣布达成战略合作，双方联合推出的 AI 歌手音乐创作软件“网易云音乐・X Studio”已正式上线，面向广大音乐人和音乐爱好者免费使用。


据官方介绍，该软件可帮助音乐人轻松创作高质量的 AI 新世代音乐作品，是全球主流音乐平台与人工智能公司联手打造的首个同类产品。软件首发 12 名 AI 歌手，并将不断推新，扩充 AI 歌手阵营。同日，双方还宣布首个虚拟歌手厂牌 WOWAIDO！成立。


网易云音乐・X Studio 支持 Windows 与 macOS 双平台，官方称搭载了丰富的前沿性人工智能小冰黑科技，并经过双方深度合作定制调校。技术方面，包括小冰歌唱模型、一致性超级自然语音、流式渲染歌声合成和视觉神经网络渲染等技术。在演唱方面，可在 3 秒内生成专业歌手水准的 AI 演唱干声，还能通过参数实现 AI 歌手的滑音、转音、颤音、咬字、节奏、音色或强弱变化等，细腻演绎作品效果。X Studio 支持合并 AI 音轨数量高达 30 轨，这意味着让每个音乐人都拥有一支“30 人”合唱团。


官方称，X Studio 的 AI 歌手阵营具备高度拟人及多样化的声线风格，可适配流行、民谣、国风、电子、摇滚等各种曲风，说唱等更多风格也将于近期更新上线。


此次软件首发的 12 名 AI 歌手，组成厂牌 WOWAIDO！正式出道，首张迷你专辑《WOWAIDO！Ⅰ 地心引力》已在网易云音乐上线。其中，成员 AI 何畅等曾先后与马伯骞、卞子严、小柯多位知名音乐人合作。抖音百万粉丝女歌手夏语冰、陈水若，以及在内测阶段呼声较高的若溪、崔璨等，也在首发名单中出现。


官方还称，软件包含高安全性和隐私保护策略，所有 AI 歌手均经过严格的数据训练，所有的创作均可溯源。

                              <span>Hi Hacker News! We’re Ravin and Jack, the founders of Credal.ai (https://www.credal.ai/). We provide a Chat UI and APIs that enforce PII redaction, audit logging, and data access controls for companies that want to use LLMs with their corporate data from Google Docs, Slack, or Confluence. There’s a demo video here: https://www.loom.com/share/2b5409fd64464dc9b5b6277f2be4e90f?....
One big thing enterprises and businesses are worried about with LLMs is “what’s happening to my data”? The way we see it, there are three big security and privacy barriers companies need to solve:
1. Controlling what data goes to whom: the basic stuff is just putting controls in place around customer and employee PII, but it can get trickier when you also want to be putting controls in place around business secrets…</span>

                              <span>Robert Haas looks
at the advantages and disadvantages of how documentation for PostgreSQL
is written.


	The strengths of this process are also its weaknesses. A developer
	is, by definition, someone who spends the majority of their time
	doing development, which is to say writing code. Updating the
	documentation becomes a task that must be completed so that the
	code one has written can get committed so that one can move on to
	the next project and write some more code. If a change to the
	documentation would be beneficial but is unrelated to any
	particular patch, it&#x27;s not likely to get done.

	The results are, in a certain sense, pretty comical.</span>

previous day, Christian Brauner led another discussion about providing user
space with a mechanism to get current mount information on day two of the
2023 Linux Storage, Filesystem,

one at last year&#x27;s 
summit—and likely others before that.
There are two separate proposals for ways to retrieve this kind of

of whom were present this year; Brauner&#x27;s intent was to try to reach some
kind of agreement on the way forward in the session.</span>

                              <span>6 月 14 日消息，在 2023 开放原子全球开源峰会上，阿里云公布 1+4 开源战略，在操作系统、云原生、数据库、大数据四大开源领域之外，AI 模型社区魔搭作为大模型方向的开源新势力首次亮相。据悉，目前已有 15 款支持中文的开源大模型在魔搭社区上线。



开放原子开源基金会是我国首家开源基金会，于 2020 年 6 月在北京成立，由阿里等多家科技企业联合发起，主管单位为工信部。今年，阿里云首次将魔搭社区（ModelScope）带到开放原子全球开源峰会这一顶尖开源大会上。

去年 11 月，阿里与 CCF 开源发展委员会联手推出魔搭社区，初衷就是通过开源开放、共建社区生态的方式，让 AI 开发使用更简单。魔搭社区践行模型即服务（Model as a Service）（MaaS）新理念，提供多类优质 AI 模型以及模型调优、训练、部署等一体化服务，旨在降低AI模型应用门槛。

经过半年左右的发展，魔搭已经成为国内规模最大、最活跃的 AI 模型开源社区，开发者数量超 160 万，模型下载量超 2500 万，累计开源开放了 900 多个优质 AI 模型，包括阿里通义大模型系列、澜舟科技的孟子模型、智谱 AI 的中英双语千亿大模型等 15 款支持中文的开源大模型。魔搭社区现已成为中国 AI 模型开源第一门户。未来，魔搭社区将继续帮助开发者将 AI 模型转化为生产力，持续推动 AI 领域的开源生态建设。



阿里云是开源的受益者，也是积极贡献者。在操作系统领域，阿里云、统信软件等联合发起的龙蜥社区已成为国内领先的操作系统开源社区。在云原生领域，阿里云的开源项目覆盖容器调度、微服务、分布式应用治理等多个重要领域。在数据库领域，阿里云核心产品 PolarDB 数据库 PostgreSQL 版和分布式版已经开源。在大数据领域，Flink 是当下被广泛使用的开源大数据计算引擎之一。

三年来，阿里云一直积极参与开放原子开源基金会建设，积极向基金会捐赠开源项目。龙蜥操作系统在 2021 年 10 月进入基金会孵化流程；阿里云倡议发起云原生工作委员会后，双方就 ACK Distro 和云原生应用脚手架两个开源项目达成捐赠意向。此外，阿里云还深度参与建设了 AtomGit 代码协作平台。

开放原子开源基金会副理事长、阿里云市场总裁刘湘雯在会上表示，未来阿里云将持续拥抱开源生态，持续投入 AI、云原生、数据库、大数据、操作系统等领域的开源工作，持续提升开发者服务和企业创新支持，为开源创新提速。</span>

上周伊朗军方展示了其海军大学开发的“量子处理算法”的首款产品，它能帮助军方探测水面的扰动。但通过媒体公布的“量子”设备图像的分析显示，该设备可能是一款在亚马逊上出售的 FPGA 开发板 ZedBoard，在图像上甚至可以清晰地看到该品牌名。ZedBoard 开发板主要是用于视频处理、可重构计算、电机控制、软件加速等用途，并不具有“量子比特”。

老王点评：有没有一种可能，他们就是在这样的板卡上安装了几个“量子比特”？🤣




人工智能对人工智能生成的内容进行训练将导致人工智能崩溃

用于训练大型语言模型的数据最初来自人类来源，如书籍、文章、照片等，这些都是在没有人工智能的帮助下创建的。但随着越来越多的人使用人工智能来制作和发布内容，一个明显的问题出现了：当人工智能生成的内容在互联网上扩散时，人工智能模型开始对其进行训练。研究人员发现，“在训练中使用模型生成的内容会导致所产生的模型出现不可逆转的缺陷。”他们研究了文本到文本和图像到图像的人工智能生成模型的概率分布，得出结论：“从其他模型产生的数据中学习会导致模型崩溃 —— 这是一个退化的过程，并且随着时间的推移，模型会忘记真正的基础数据分布。”他们观察到模型崩溃发生得如此之快：模型可以迅速忘记它们最初学习的大部分原始数据。这导致它们随着时间的推移，表现越来越差，错误越来越多。

老王点评：这让我想起了衔尾蛇，一种自己吞噬自己尾巴的蛇。这样下来人工智能失去对世界的真正认知，我们的未来或许再也分不清现实和人工智能虚构的“现实”。




Meta 开源了音乐和图像模型

Meta 公司开源发布了自己的人工智能音乐生成器 MusicGen。它可以将文字描述（例如 “一首 80 年代的流行歌曲，背景音效是重鼓声和合成器垫音效”）变成大约 12 秒的音频。该公司没有提供用于训练模型的代码，但它提供了预训练的模型，任何拥有合适硬件的人，如 16GB 的 GPU 都可以运行。

Meta 也发布了一个 “类似人类” 的人工智能图像创作模型 I-JEPA，训练代码和模型快照发布在 GitHub 上。Meta 称，该模型利用相关世界的背景知识来填补图像的缺失部分，而不是像其他生成性人工智能模型那样只看附近的像素。它使用了类似人类的推理，可以避免人工智能生成的图像中常见的错误，如多了手指的手。

                              <span>在安装完 Debian 12 “Bookworm”要做的一些事情。


我想你已经安装好了 Debian 12 “Bookworm” 或者 准备升级 了。Debian 12 经过一年多的开发，于 2023 年 6 月 10 日发布。它带来了最新的软件包、升级和替换一些关键模块。请在此查看 Debian 12 的一些新特性 指南。

如果你在笔记本电脑或台式机上使用 Debian，那么在安装或升级到 Debian 12 后，以下是你可能需要完成的一些步骤。

Debian 12 安装后需要做的几件事情

启用 sudo

如果你将 Debian 12 作为新安装的系统，那么你的用户账户可能没有超级用户访问权限。出于安全原因，Debian 在安装期间不允许任何选项给予用户账户 sudo 访问权限。以下是如何将用户添加到超级用户组。

打开终端并使用 root 密码进入 root 账户。

su


然后运行以下命令，将你的用户账户添加到 sudo 组。请将下面的用户名更改为你的账户。

/sbin/addgroup 用户名 sudo


现在，你可以注销并再次登录该账户。

确保 Debian 已更新至最新版本

在开始工作或进行任何配置之前，确保 Debian 12 已更新至最新版本非常重要。从终端中按以下顺序运行以下命令以刷新 Debian 系统。

sudo apt update
sudo apt upgrade


Debian 12 中的非自由软件

Debian 12 中有一个关于管理“非自由”固件包的根本变化。Debian 创建了一个新的软件源，以便轻松访问那些专有包。因此，如果你想添加非自由软件包，需要确保在 APT 软件源文件 /etc/apt/sources.list 中添加以下行：

                              <span>使用这个方便的应用查看你的网络连接。




嗅探，嗅探，那是什么？ 🤔

这是我在系统上看到的可疑网络连接吗？ 🚨❌

你可能想知道我如何查看系统上的网络活动。 嗯，当然，一些 系统监控工具 应该有所帮助。但是，如果我想要更多详细信息怎么办？

好吧，我遇到了一个不错的工具 Sniffnet。 它是一个用于实时监控网络活动的简洁的开源应用，也是专有的 GlassWire（如 Portmaster）的一个很好的替代品。

那么，让我们深入挖掘吧！

Sniffnet：概述 ⭐



Sniffnet 是一个基于 Rust 的网络监控工具，可让你跟踪通过系统的所有互联网流量。 它提供了一些非常有用的功能，高级用户肯定会喜欢这些功能**。

当你第一次启动 Sniffnet 时，你会看到一个菜单来选择网络适配器、过滤器和应用协议。

完成选择后，单击“火箭”按钮开始。



这是概览页的样子。它显示了所有当前的网络连接，以及一个方便的流量图，供你分析流量。


📋 你可以选择将数据显示为字节或单个数据包。




要更深入地查看你的网络连接，你可以前往“检查Inspect”选项卡。

在这里，你将看到一个包含所有重要信息的列表，例如 IP 地址、数据包数量、数据量、来源国家等等。

你可以单击各个连接获得更详细的情况。



如果你想为更具体的目的过滤结果怎么办？

好吧，那么你可以使用“检查”选项卡下的过滤器选项根据你的需要过滤结果。

你可以通过以下方式过滤列表： 应用、国家、域名等。

这是它的样子：



Sniffnet 还可以向你显示可以以文本格式导出的连接的详细报告。

只需单击右下角带有页面/向右箭头的徽标即可开始。



可定制性如何？

好吧，Sniffnet 有一组不错的设置供你调整。

第一个是“通知”选项卡，它允许你根据可以设置的各种阈值来设置通知的行为。



然后是可以通过“样式Style”选项卡访问的主题。它提供四种选择，雪人之夜是我的最爱。



最后，“语言Language”选项卡允许你设置你选择的界面语言。



好了，就此结束。

Sniffnet 是一个方便的工具，可以非常详细地了解系统上的网络活动。

你可以使用它来监控你的网络。

此外，与另一个网络监控工具 Nutty 相比，在我看来，Sniffnet 的使用和设置要直观得多。

📥 获取 Sniffnet

Sniffnet 可跨多个平台使用，包括 Linux、Windows 和 macOS。 你可以前往官方网站获取你选择的安装包。


Sniffnet


如果愿意，你还可以在 GitHub 上仔细查看其源代码。

2023年春，《有凤来仪——夏含夷教授七十华诞祝寿论文集》由中西书局正式出版。夏含夷（Edward L. Shaughnessy）是芝加哥大学教授、《剑桥中国上古史》主编。正好夏先生来北京，我专程赴京，4月20日上午、21日晚上分两次对夏先生做了访谈。

《有凤来仪：夏含夷教授七十华诞祝寿论文集》，朱渊清  苏荣誉主编，中西书局2022年12月出版，270.00元

朱渊清：夏先生，这次给您带来了七十岁祝寿的论文集《有凤来仪》，终于出版了。
夏含夷：太好了，非常感谢你。要请你和各位作者给这本书签名。
朱渊清：三十一位中国学者的论文，前些日子已经寄给您电子档，您满意吗？
夏含夷：很满意。我还没有读完。涉及内容实在是太丰富了。
朱渊清：您一辈子从事中国古史研究，取得了巨大的成就，很希望请您谈谈自己的学术经历。
夏含夷：没问题。
朱渊清：您是什么时候如何开始学习中文的，又是如何走上中国古史的研究之路的？
夏含夷：1968年我读高中时正在打越战。1970年我进大学，读的是圣母大学。这是听从了我父亲的建议，不然的话可能就要去当兵。我对思想史有兴趣，大学一年级时遇到两个四年级的朋友，跟着他们听了几门神学课，对中国的道教、禅宗很感兴趣。1972年三年级时，学校终于开了门中文课，老师是香港来的。这是我学中文之始。三年级结束我去参加明德大学暑期班，专门补习中文。明德大学暑期班学习外语特别好，学校周围的风景也很漂亮。
朱渊清：我知道。您的大女儿也在明德大学读过书，学中文。
夏含夷：对。在明德大学暑期班学习外语必须先签一个保证书，保证整个夏天不说英语。老师和学生学习、生活在一起，必须时时讲中文。非常累。
朱渊清：除了中文语言，您对中国文化的兴趣最初是在道教、禅宗。
夏含夷：圣母大学神学系还聘了一个大学者，是芝加哥大学毕业的，我…</span>
