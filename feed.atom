        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've finally decided to change to Wayland and would like to hear some recommendations from other users before making the jump. 
 I'm currently using a 2-in-1 laptop (convertible into a tablet device) so support for rotating screen, touchscreen, stylus and all that stuff is important to me.
 I come from XMonad so, I spect something something extremely powerful while very lightweight, but if possible not as "complicated" and more "effortless" to configure (not because of lack of skills but because of lack of time).
 I don't use a dedicated graphics card btw (and I don't plan to use it, at least in the near future) so I don't care about Nvidia GPU support neither anything like that. I guess that simplifies things.
 Thanks in advance for your answers. I'll respond ASAP to those interesting threads.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[How did you all get so good at operating linux/command line stuff? And understanding what it all means like errors and troubleshooting stuff i.e. "tail -f" "journalctl -fu"...etc. ? I work for a tech company in the defense industry. I am a tech/operator. As part of my job I have to do software updates to some of the systems that I use, and work on servers regularly. I have a handful of commands memorized. Meanwhile some of the engineers I work with are absolute wizards when it comes to this stuff, and can navigate through linux no problem, and probably have 100+ commands memorized, know what everything means. When i asked some of the guys I work with. They all had the same answer pretty much, and said they just learned on their own, no progams/courses or schooling. For the most part it seems like it just comes naturally to them. I looked into a few courses, but so many of them had bad reviews. So I decided to not to go that route. But I do take tons of notes, and refer back to them often if I am forgetting a step or something. 
 So I was just curious if anyone here had any helpful tips on how I could get better at navigating my way through some of this stuff?

And I just found out that there is a PR in the lightdm's github repo that actually fixes it, but they didn't merge it considering it not that important. So, I think if enough people respond or post a comment on this PR, showing their interest, then they might merge it and finally we can have wayland compositors with LightDM. Sounds great doesn't it?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Recently, I have discovered that Gnome Wayland will flash the whole screen with a white color every time a screenshot is taken. This effect is only applied when something else that the builtin screenshot tool takes a screenshot. 
 So, every time an external app takes a screenshot, Gnome will flash-bang you for a split second, with a screen full of white. 
 I suffer from severe migraines, and this effect immediately makes me fell sick. 
 What is even worse is that there seems to be little to no cool-down between those flashes. If a tool takes screenshots often, you will get your own light show. I had the misfortune of running a screenshot processing benchmark before I discovered this obnoxious "feature" of Gnome Wayland. So, I got blasted with an effect after effect. Every time one faded, the next one flashed me in the eyes. Some of those effects even queued due to lag, and then played all at once. 
 So, if you are considering switching to Gnome Wayland, and have any sort of sensitivity to light, please be very careful. 
 It seems like the only way to disable this potentially dangerous effect is going in accessibility, and selecting Reduce Animation, and disabling almost all the animations in Gnome(which makes it look quite bad). This is a shame, because this is the only effect that i have any kind of issue with.
 If you have any issues with flashing lights, I would recommend turning that setting on.

        <id>https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41723569</id>
        <link href="https://github.com/tqwewe/kameo"/>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi HN,
I’m excited to share Kameo, a lightweight Rust library that helps you build fault-tolerant, distributed, and asynchronous actors. If you're working on distributed systems, microservices, or real-time applications, Kameo offers a simple yet powerful API for handling concurrency, panic recovery, and remote messaging between nodes.
Key Features:
- Async Rust: Each actor runs as a separate Tokio task, making concurrency management simple.
- Remote Messaging: Seamlessly send messages to actors across different nodes.
- Supervision and Fault Tolerance: Create self-healing systems with actor hierarchies.
- Backpressure Support: Supports bounded and unbounded mpsc messaging.
I built Kameo because I wanted a more intuitive, scalable solution for distributed Rust applications. I’d love feedback from the HN community and contributions from anyone interested in Rust and actor-based systems.
Check out the project on GitHub: https://github.com/tqwewe/kameo
Looking forward to hearing your thoughts!

 Obviously things like the raspberry pi have been arm forever and Linux runs just fine on them. It seems like arm is such a common compile target especially with armed servers becoming popular in the last couple years. I'm assuming I can run just about everything without a problem. Have you guys tried it? I'm on Arch.

 UPDATE: The Galaxy M51 seems to be affected as well.
 It appears the cause is a SmartThings Framework app update, which initiates the bootloop while installing.
 This comment mentioned that people are approaching smartphone shops with the same problem and other comments have confirmed the issue is present in Korea, Singapore, Australia, Belgium, France, and Germany. It's seemingly global.
  
Devices confirmed to be affected. * S10 * S10e * S10+ * S10 5G * Note10 * Note10+ * Note10+ 5G
  
No word on the S10 Lite or Note10 Lite, but assume they are affected as well.
 This comment provides instructions on how to factory reset the phone, which will wipe all data.
 There is currently no fix that keeps or recovers the data.
 Original post on r/samsunggalaxy.
 Edit: Added Note10+ and Note10+ 5G, Belgium, France, and Australia.

具体表现就是一个循环的 6 点圆圈，重启状态进入比较随机。
有的时候是在手表上点击某个应用，有时是手表处于表盘状态，还有在骑自行车记录户外骑车的过程中。
一般重启状态短的就半分钟恢复，长的会有 3 ～ 5 分钟。
国庆前已经通过三里屯直营店送回工厂检测，没有检测出问题，只是帮我升级到了 watchOS 最新系统，结果国庆节第二天就重新出现了这个情况。

I ignored it and kept working, but then i noticed something strange, my phone got unlocked automatically, when gemini stopped listeing.
 I was shocked to see what had happened.
 I tried to reproduce this, and it is 100% of times working on my phone.
 There is some issue with the calculator app which come with the phone preinstalled. If it was the last app which you were using and locked the phone while using the app. The next time you say "Hey google" and the gemini launches, wait for it to stop (press back to spped it up), and the phone gets unlocked.

事件详情
2024 年 9 月 20 日凌晨 3 点，我的 Gmail 邮箱突然收到一封来自 YouTube 官方发来邮件：Sign up for YouTube Premium again to maintain your membership （翻译：再次注册 YouTube Premium 以保留您的会员资格）。内容包含：由于我们认为注册国家/地区“尼日利亚”不准确，因此您的 YouTube Premium 会员资格已被取消。
这是我其中一个跨尼区 YouTube 会员被清退 的邮件通知， 其它几个账号暂未收到清退邮件，但预计也即将遭遇同样的情况。博客文章写于凌晨 4 点，相信大家在一觉醒来后，会是一片凄苦连天的景象 😭 。
时间点：2024 年 9 月 20 日凌晨 3 点左右
受影响区域：主要包括尼日利亚、土耳其等低价区
清退原因：YouTube 方面称”注册国家/地区信息不准确”
尼日利亚油管会员被清退邮件通知
用户反馈
事情发生在凌晨 3 点，从其它论坛和频道均发现不少“受害者”。

合租群油管会员清退消息
事件分析
YouTube 清退力度加大：
相比 2024 年 6 月的小规模清退，此次行动范围更广
清退速度加快，短时间内影响大量用户
低价区会员优势逐渐消失：
土耳其等传统低价区频繁涨价
数字游民可选择的低价区域越来越少
对用户影响
即时影响：
会员资格被取消，无法继续享受 Premium 服务
需要重新订阅，可能面临更高的价格
长期影响：
跨区订阅难度增加，风险提高
可能需要寻找新的替代方案或接受本地区价格
此次，中国大陆用户被清退的案例已经不在少数。相信 YouTube 正在逐步加大清退低价区力度。
话说回来，其实迟早会有这么一天，低价区的羊毛迟早要终结。以前的低价神话“土耳其”，各个会员低价频繁遭遇涨价，虽然数字游民的活动区间越来越小，但毕竟还有选择的余地（越来越小）。苦了的是真正的“土耳其人”。
这次 YouTube Premium 的大规模清退行动，无疑给许多习惯于跨区订阅的用户敲响了警钟。你们遇到清退了吗？欢迎在评论区分享你的经历和看法。]]></summary>

这是一个去中心化、无服务器的匿名聊天浏览器扩展程序，利用 WebRTC 进行端到端加密通信。所有数据都存储在本地，所一你不用担心隐私，目的是为每个网站扩展聊天室的功能。
这个想法存在很久了，但是一直没找到比较好的 P2P 实现方式，前不久发现了一个神奇的库： https://github.com/dmotz/trystero
它支持将 BitTorrent, 🐦 Nostr, 📡 MQTT, ⚡️ Supabase, 🔥 Firebase, or 🪐 IPFS 这些去中心化网络作为 WebRTC 的信令服务，正真的做到无服务器运行。

我想知道的是，有没有什么磁轴键盘带有 API ，可以让我的代码读取到键被按压时行程连续改变的事件。比如说，让我的代码能知道，X 键被按下了 2mm ，过了一段时间，被抬起了 1mm ，又过了一段时间，又被抬起了 1mm 回到初始位置，类似这样子。
不确定 DIY 键盘的大佬平时都在什么圈子，如果知道这个问题更适合求助的渠道也烦请告知。]]></summary>

I started in 2020 during Covid trying to do a Mount and Blade style map in UE4, and it grew from there until where it is now - I would just add a feature, then another, until it came together. Since the start of the year I've really been trying to polish it some more.
I've got the full thing planned for a Q3 25 release.

联想到基普乔格破 2 时行动时，前方有一辆投射投影的配速车

还有田径比赛的时候跑道侧有移动的灯光标识。
感觉如果有这样一个东西在足够便宜的前提下，会让人操场跑圈跑间歇的时候可能更舒服的？
来请教一下，有没有比较成熟且不会很贵的方案。
抖音上刷到一家类似的（但是产品线功能更全的），报价 7 位数开始，有点恐怖了。
叠甲：跑间歇的时候快个几秒慢的几秒当然不会很影响到训练效果，只是在想有没有什么可以更有趣的方式]]></summary>

I thought that was because the laptop refuses to use any parts not made by the manufacturer. so I returned both SSD to their previous places. the windows SSD on the motherboard and the Linux SSD on the external M.2. I deleted windows from the motherboard SSD and started copying linux to the motherboard SSD using clonezilla. the copying was successful. then it gave the same reading error when i boot it up. I am not an expert in hardware but my theory is that the new SSD after using it on an external M.2. it installed for it self USB drivers instead of normal SSD drivers, resulting in the external SSD thinking it is a normal USB flash. I still did not find any fixes yet but soon I will legally copy windows from a random device to get one of the SSDs back to their sense. then reinstall linux while the SSD is in the laptop motherboard.

 I have observed an idea I have just shared with Nvidia. Otherwise I may implement it on optimus-manager itself.
 Probably we could improve desktop animations by setting the min frequency of the GPU a bit higher.

I’ve read rumors that many firms are actually in a hiring freeze, but they keep job reqs open for appearances. Apparently some investors use job postings as a company health metric.
From my contacts, I am personally aware of situations where internally-recommended CVs are ignored by HR, and other cases had open job postings and passed people successfully through the interview process, and then the hiring manager still didn’t pull the trigger. I have no way of knowing how widespread this is, but it is happening at some places.
Is your company like this? If you have real info and not just suspicions, let’s name some names.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[本人在海外留学一直使用和法定中文名不同的 preferred name ，最近想在护照上加注自己的英文名，想请教下大家几个问题：
护照加注英文名可以通过海外使领馆搞定吗？我之前看了微信公众号的一篇文章据说可以，但是会不会国内更方便/更快？在国内/在海外哪个更推荐一些？
我看了下大致流程说需要“一些能证明你名字的资料”，这些资料是不是一定要像改名证明/姓名公证之类的法定文件才行？还是说平时一直使用这个名字的材料（比如参加活动的名牌、一些来往通信、非政府官方证件🪪等非法定材料）就行了？
算是第二个问题的延伸，这些资料是不是一定要法定材料才行？如果是的话，那么护照加注是不是还得先去公证处做个证明才行？
具体从开始申请到办好的时间需要多久？
护照加注后可以把海外官方证件（比如驾照、学生证等，还有信用卡）换成加注的英文名吗？
先十分感谢各位提供帮助🙏祝各位有美好的一天☀️]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[感觉 /t/1076321 说的很细致很诙谐, 受此鼓励, 特意分享, 希望能帮到人.
仅作分享,不做争论: 我在7 月份去香港买了Redmi Note13 pro+ .
起因
在过去几年我都是随身携带两部手机出行, 但有时候觉得不太方便, 太累赘..  
主用安卓 P20(一张米粉卡保号+一张二折冰激淋全家流量和宽带)  
备用 iphone se3(澳门版, 一张实体 3hk diy+两张 esim).  
安卓机器太老了, 导航时卡顿严重, 查资料切换多个 app 时反应慢, 同时充电只有 22W.
所以我一直在寻找一款多卡双待单通的手机, 希望在出门时只带一部手机, 同时方便切换内外网.  
经过
在筛选手机时, 我主要考虑了几点, 其他参数开盲盒.    
双卡, 支持实体 sim+esim  
充电功率大于等于 100W  
屏幕尺寸大于等于 6.7  
经过筛查, 当时大概有几款进入视线:  
vivo x100 pro  (100W)
Xiaomi 14 (90W)
Xiaomi 13T pro (120W, 12+512, 官网 4599HKD, 门店实际 4499, 因非曲面屏 pass) 
Redmi Note13 pro+ (120W, 12+512, 官网 2999HKD, 门店实际 2899)  
Redmi Note13 pro (67W, 2499HKD)
最后选择小米有以下因素:  
在查规格时感觉 xiaomi hk 官网款式参数清晰, 价格明确, 方便对比.  
hk map 搜索 xiaomi or vivo, 小米有专营店(mi home).  
结果
想什么来什么, 临时被派去广州出差, 收拾行李时我特意带了港澳通行证, 但是忘带银行卡..尴尬..  
周五晚上找 24 小时自助机办了签注，当时很忐忑, 怕非粤籍办理签注要求居住证啥的，没想到一张身份证就解决了.
周六买了充电宝, 因为怕出境无法取现换了 300 港币. 换外币一般是需要预约的.  
周日选了八点多的高铁，因为查到小米之家十点开门, 九点多下了高铁, alipay hk 坐地铁到 mi home(Chong Hing Square), 结果到了门口发现 11 点才开门.  
因为是第三次去香港了, 没什么好奇的, 就在小红书搜了家网咖上了 2 小时的网打发时间，凭港澳通行证开机, 10 港币 1 小时, 尴尬的是电脑都不配耳机..
网速上下行对等 200Mbps, 当然可以看 netflix 和 disney+.  
门店开门后, 买了手机, 两张境内卡插进去, 在 3hk app 中办理 diy 实体卡转 esim, 搞定. 然后又买了平板和 mi box 2S.
感受
note13pp sim slot2 和 esim 只能同时用一个, 通过下拉控制菜单 3 秒可完成 sim 切换. 疑似不能使用双 5G.  
充电 120W从 0 到 100%只需 19 分钟, 所以我都是下班前用几分钟充满走人. 对比我设置了 se 电量低于 70%自动进入省电模式的自动化, 真的是天差地别.  
note13pp 自带谷歌全家桶, 相册可设置自动同步到 google 相册. 系统地区无法设置为中国大陆, miui 为 MIUI Global 14.0.8, play 商店可能无法通过软路由下载 app(我遇到了).  
下载境内 app 我借助了 oppo 的应用市场, 开始用的华为应用市场, 但是后者下的 app 版本不太好用.  
讽刺的是, 买完手机看新闻就看到大陆小米不给解锁 bt 了.  
后续使用中, 发现指纹解锁有时解锁后黑屏 3 秒, 出现概率 3%左右吧.  
后续新品中, xiaomi 14T/14T pro 都是双卡且支持 esim, 但是系统是 HyperOS 了, 然后听说境外版本也不支持解锁 bt 了.  
感谢观看,就说这么多.]]></summary>

Internationalizing/localizing is hard. You have to comb through your whole app and look for what needs to be translated and manually update your translations every time new stuff gets added. People sometimes hire their own in-house translators, or they send off their translations to humans to be translated, which takes days, weeks, or worse and costs a ton. Internationalization is, of course, super important for user growth and retention, and often neglected until very late, when competitors will make your product for LATAM, APAC, or Europe.

A match made in heaven for me. I feel like people need to embrace terminology since it can do graphics right in the terminal via escapes. The two both have the one other thing I look for in a wm: easily able to recompile source and go, much like nano and vim are to me as editors, i3 and E are to me as wms. 
 I think E especially needs a round of applause just for being around for so long. I remember compiling it 20 years ago just as I am now and being just as excited about it :3

We’re Brendan and Michael, the creators of Sourcebot (https://github.com/sourcebot-dev/sourcebot). Sourcebot is an open-source code search tool that allows you to quickly search across many large codebases. Check out our demo video here: https://youtu.be/mrIFYSB_1F4, or try it for yourself on our demo site here: https://demo.sourcebot.dev
While at prior roles, we’ve both felt the pain of searching across hundreds of multi-million line codebases. Using local tools like grep were ill-suited since you often only had a handful of codebases checked out at a time. Sourcegraph (https://sourcegraph.com/) solves this issue by indexing a collection of codebases in the background and exposing a web-based search interface. It is the de-facto search solution for medium to large orgs, but is ofte…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[pwr-tray · PyPI is a qt5 system tray applet with power management features for i3 and sway using systemd. On i3, the menu might look like:
 pwr-tray menu (right-click its icon)
 As the menu suggests, it provides many one-click commands (after opening the menu) including changing mode (Presentation, SleepAfterLock, and LockOnly), changing timeouts, immediate screen locking, etc. It deals with systemd inhibits, media player inhibits, low battery situations, etc. That is, it consolidates many related needs w/o messy configs. And its colorful icons inform you of its major modes and states.
 As a bonus, it works for KDE+X11, too. I first developed pwr-tray back when (for me at least) KDE's power management was perpetually broken. This version is a qt5 app which may require some to install the qt5 foundation as a prerequisite.
 A unified power management app is quite the pain on Linux ... hence, pwr-tray on runs only on the few DEs/WMs I care to use. Cheers.

We’re sharing some of the challenges we faced building an AI video interface that has realistic conversations with a human, including getting it to under 1 second of latency.
To try it, talk to Hassaan’s digital twin: https://www.hassaanraza.com, or to our "demo twin" Carter: https://www.tavus.io
We built this because until now, we've had to adapt communication to the limits of technology. But what if we could interact naturally with a computer? Conversational video makes it possible – we think it'll eventually be a key human-computer interface.

光猫桥接，主路由红米 AX6 已刷 ImmortalWrt 23.05
尝试了 shellclash 的各种核心和相关设置，好像都是时好时坏，不知道是机场太垃圾还是设置有误，机场目前用的 6 元每月
比如
影响手机游戏的一些公屏聊天+进房间对战（怀疑是 UDP 相关的问题），
偶尔翻墙失效（已经配置规则是自动选择）
国内访问有时也有问题（看面板规则走的是 DIRECT,小白图省事，只能登陆路由器停掉科学服务就好了），
IPv6 失效，（可能是我设置不对，具体表现为禁用 IPV4 协议栈时访问不了淘宝，停掉科学服务就好了）
外网访问内网服务器的 443 端口失效（已配置好相关的防火墙规则，停掉科学服务或者过滤掉这台服务器则可以，但这台服务器有时候要用 git 或者 docker,总是避免不了也有科学上网的需要）
希望达到效果
访问控制，只让部分设备流量被接管
可能的话能否用 realip, 不知道是不是 fakeip 导致的问题，而且有时候想 nslookup 或者 ping 个域名，也不方便
能兼容 IPv6, 电视 TVbox 想用 IPv6 源，好多教程都让关 IPv6
🤣总之就是尽可能智能，在有需要科学上网时，流量才经过核心
😢😢😢已经在恶补 mihomo 文档和 singbox 文档，但似乎还要了解 nftables]]></summary>

呆在沿海可能被裁了能继续找？回老家毕竟和父母观念不太一致，屁事儿估计很多。。。。
最近也在想要不要把手里的钱花掉买房子上车安心生活，但如果花掉了，其实想再挣这些钱还是挺难的，但是至少有一个安稳的窝了。
如果回老家把这些钱存着，感觉光靠这些存款利息很难有个好的生活（如果工作没了的话），自己也想在 30 岁之前再多搞一些钱
很犹豫不知道如何办？老哥们可以给点建议吗？]]></summary>

因为做种很多，上传带宽很小所以基本上一直是满速上传。
**做种的时候，连微信收发消息有巨大延迟，这导致我不得不考虑给做种限速。**
但是因为是两台 NAS ，所以比如，如果给 A NAS 20m 上行，B NAS 20m 上行，那还是没用。
用的是华硕 GT-AX6000 路由器，目前官方固件里的 QoS 试了一下，发现没用，微信还是卡。
我看到路由器里能看到可以识别 BT 的流量（见下图），但是就是没找到地方能为 BT 流量专门限速。所以发帖问一下有没有这种办法呢？
或者有其它合适的方法也好]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Since Arch leader Levente Polyak's announcement on their mailing list that Valve would be providing backing for two critical projects for the distro, a build service infrastructure and a secure signing enclave, many in the community were speculating about what this means in a practical sense, why Valve would be interested in sponsoring these projects in particular, as well as what it means for Arch's autonomy as a community-run, volunteer-driven distro. Arch maintainer Antiz joined the A1R Podcast yesterday to answer all of these questions and put some concerns to rest!

目前通过 DP 接到 Windows 上可以达到 4K 240 Hz ，体验很完美。但是 Mac 通过 type-c 接到显示器上后，最高只能达到 4K 100Hz ，开了 HDR 后，只有 4k 60 Hz 。
使用的线材都是显示器自带的。
想咨询一下大家有没有用同款显示器接 Intel Mac 的，这个刷新率是正常的吗？如果是 M 系列芯片，最高可以达到的刷新率和分辨率是多少？]]></summary>

木几萌是国内最早的 AI 主播，由 XWdit 创造，并在 B 站出圈，因其可爱的造型和温柔的形象圈粉无数（具体可去 B 站搜搜）。
目前 XWdit 创立了中文领域最先进的语音合成平台 Reecho.ai，也就是太先进了，被人用于伪造9·16 三只羊录音事件。
扯多了。。。这里发个帖子主要是为了我们合作要将木几萌开源，配上 reecho 社区上木几萌的官方语音，简直无敌了，大家可以看看 demo 视频，记得打开声音哦！
我也是连夜用 C++把项目实现了，很轻量化，现在只做了 mac 版的，后续希望大家给多提点意见。看能不能重现木几萌在 B 站最初的辉煌。]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So, I switched from Windows to Linux in June. I was interested since before then, and CrowdStrike pretty much is the nail that close any desire of mine to reinstall Windows again. So I took my blank DVD, burn the Pop!_OS ISO and I install Linux into my ASUS X44H. In short, Pop 22.04 was great, definitely a great time for me. But then I have a GRUB error, and so I install my next distro: Arch
 So I follow this guide and I install Arch on my laptop. I love the fact that it's bleeding edge and AUR is definitely something that I wish all distro have. My only real issue was the GRUB error, which I managed to fix by... reinstall GRUB (Thanks, r/archlinux) and Wine. Unfortunately, Wine prefix creation doesn't seem to work on BTRFS and later when I use Arch again, I use ext4, and while that fix things, Wine still have problem that I am not willing to try and troubleshoot. Also, I use Wine to play Touhou, I can't exactly use any PC without playing Touhou anymore
 Finally, I use Mint, which works perfectly for me in everything that I use (minus AUR and Hyprland). It's just works out of the box. Ok, not really, I still have to setup zram and turn off several things, but afterward, it's all good. It's what I use now on my laptop
 Maybe when I get a new PC, I might multiboot Windows 11 LTSC (for Koikatu and every other game that I can't get to work on Linux. No game that use kernel level anti-cheat though), Mint, Arch and maybe Pop 24.04, whenever it's out

 in the mean time using linux is pretty painless! even games i didnt think would work do, it turns out wine and proton are insanely powerful. I grew up with mac os so it feels great to be back on a os that is unix based. using backslashes felt so weird lol
 first pc upgrade in 7 years 7700k to 5800x3d 16gb to 32gb ram new mobo 3 4tb drives in raid 5
 all running on mx linux and feeling amazing. i tried dual booting mint for a month and after getting my sealegs I absolutely love how it behaves. KDE is awesome
 I wish that games like League of Legends etc would work but its fine, ill just silo them off onto a windows drive i guess 
 just wanted to share yet another success story. i wish i had switched earlier instead of bitching for 5 years lmao

 math.h is a C library with a bunch of useful math functions. What I really want is that for my command line scripts.
 I know there's lots of cli calculators, (dc, bc, qalc etc...), but that's not what I'm looking for.
 Anyone know of a collection of simple math functions like that?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[我知道说了也白说。但是仍然忍不住说几句。
这几天又到处是股票疯涨的消息，身边又有之前从未接触过股市的人来问要不要入。V 站上又讨论的热火朝天。
不禁感慨，所谓中国股民都是韭菜真的形容的非常贴切。
本人 10 年开始工作，当时就听说过 07 ，08 年的的牛市熊市的故事，然后到了 15 年，自己手里刚开始有点积蓄了，当时也是像现在一样，到处流传着股票造富的神话，千股涨停，暴风几十个涨停板等等天天刺激着自己，然后在什么都不懂的情况下贸然入场，也确实体会到了日入过万的疯狂，代价就是什么干活工作的心都没有了，天天睁眼就是打开股票软件，后期甚至被人拉去做配资。五倍的杠杆都敢上。最终结局当然是，前面几个月的浮盈在那几天就全数亏完，一朝回到解放前。
然后在 20 还是 21 年的时候，那时候刚开始是听说基金的疯狂，各种涨的神话，我由于经历过一次了，加上手里也没什么粮了，没有去过多关注，但是，身边的年轻自己几岁的同事，天天各个在讨论，今天你基金赚了多少，他赚了多少，哪怕手里只有几千块钱的，都通过支付宝买了基金。好像马上就发家致富了。也有人入了股市。当时也劝过，听不进去。不管是关系一般的随口劝几句的，还是关系很亲密的举自己例子苦口婆心的劝，都拦不住。后续的结果，当然没有好结果，是的，一个  都没有。一部分一朝回到解放前，另一部分步入负债行列。我看着他们，感觉历史真的是惊人的相似。
中间还经历过各种比特币虚拟币的疯狂神话。13 年就亲眼见证过莱特币一个晚上从 2 元到 200 的神话。自己也又去尝试了，最终，一句话，拿不住。普通人不可能拿得住。
现在，此时此刻，看着各种疯狂的新闻，讨论，抖音，我真的非常感慨。历史的车轮又一次滚滚而来，又一波年轻人长大了手里有点粮了，然后他们又疯狂的踏入那个深渊了。
最后，V 站上的年轻朋友们，如果真的打算入手，建议先搜一下 V 站往年的记录，搜一下中国股市最近二十三年的几次 千股涨停千股跌停的历史。不要以为自己是那个可以趁机捞一勺就跑的幸运儿，你不是例外，你，就是那根韭菜。]]></summary>

鉴于校园网有屏蔽谷歌个别路由的恶劣情况，遂切换至手机热点执行相同操作，结果比较吊诡的是居然换了网还是连不上。
然后又尝试换源，换源无效，错误提示仍然是 https://registry-1.docker.io/v2/的坏请求，个人感觉是换源没装上。但是教程确实是说修改/etc/docker/daemon.json 。

 Magic-tape is an image supporting fuzzy finder tui YouTube client.
 Now introducing a new feature: the video description as well as the comments written by YT viewers will be shown in the terminal window, while the video is reproduced.
 Now, for what it's worth, the user can be satisfied reading other viewers having a swing at the politicians/celebrities/stars they love to hate, or, watch closely to their heart's content, as cyber nuclear attacks are launched between self-righteous, valiant and livid keyboard fighters.
 Comment loading is asynchronous to video loading, so it is possible that there will be some delay in the appearence of the comments. That depends on the number of comments, network speed etc.

链接：https://www.houhu.info
基本思路就是收集各种渠道（雪球，东方财富，RSS 订阅等）的股票相关内容，利用 AI 做过滤+摘要。
跟一般的资讯平台相比，后湖的信息密度会更大，因为里面不仅有新闻稿，还有论坛讨论帖中提取出来的事件；另外，对于一些比较专业或者少见的关键词，后湖会自动搜索总结，生成知识卡片，帮助用户快速了解含义。
当前支持八十多支热门股票，大部分是 A 股，也有部分美股科技股和中概股，同时支持按行业查看事件

标签页

对于相似信息，会自动聚合归纳，防止重复阅读

对于一些高价值关键词，会调用搜索引擎自动搜索，AI 总结生成知识卡片

正好赶上最近的大行情，各位在入场之前，可以翻一翻相关的股票事件做做研究。当前还没做用户系统，所以无需注册，建议用电脑浏览器，挂梯子连接速度会更快。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Screenshot.
 The reason this tile is needed is because some OEMs removed the AOSP Wallet Quick Settings tile as well as the Quick Access Wallet feature. And since Google Wallet itself didn't provide its own QS tile until now, you'd need to manually open the app or add a lock screen shortcut (if possible).
 With the dedicated Google Wallet tile, though, you can open Wallet from any page. You'll need to authenticate to open it from the lock screen, though.
 This tile has rolled out to at least one user, but I don't see it yet on my devices. According to the "what's new in Google System Updates" page, you'll need Google Play Services v24.33 or later for this feature, though it seems to be rolling out as part of a server-side update.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[我们的顶层决策者，采用如此密集的政策、如此多的部门联动，要解决的核心问题是什么？我猜主要还是解决当前经济乏力的问题。
要提振经济，则要把生产和消费的整个链条中存在淤积的地方给打通。最近几年，很明显的问题是消费力下降了（例如消费品行业和旅游行业都有明显的下滑）。
哪些方法能够让消费提升呢？要么让民众觉得自己有钱，要么让民众觉得钱未来不值钱不如早点花了。
稳房价、提股价、降存量房贷利息，就是提升民众的账面财富，让其有安全感，有信心，从而更容易消费。储蓄方面，银行降息，钱没有好的投资渠道，民众则更容易花出去。事实上，这些都被近期政策覆盖了。
在此之前，也有很多小打小闹的政策出台，趋势上并没有任何改变。但此次从近期的几个政策联动之密、力度如此之大、以及近期股市资金流入的规模来看，此次顶层决心是非常大的，当然效果也更明显。
综上，我不简单认为此次股价暴涨是一次简单的割韭菜行为，而是国家宏观经济调控的结果。
如果我的这个判断是成立的，国家期望持续这个效果，则会继续维持和推动上涨的趋势，以达到扭转经济趋势的作用。至少从顶层主观意志来说，不希望再热闹一次之后一地鸡毛。
结论：保持乐观，继续持有。]]></summary>

So far, we’d focused on customer-facing experiences (e.g. find us as an “Ask AI” button in the docs of companies like Anthropic and Pinecone). Today, we’re excited to share our new copilot, Keep, which is designed specifically for support agents.
It’s a conversational sidebar you can use as an app for Zendesk or Chrome Extension for any support platform. There’s a demo video at https://vid.inkeep.com/cx-copilot or you can try the live sandbox with example tickets at https://try.inkeep.com/cx-copilot.

9 月 28 日，极简软件工作室成立 4 周年。
9 月 29 日，结婚十周年纪念日。
注册企业的时候没太注意日期，如果也是 9 月 29 日下证就更好了，一天两个纪念日。
Shipaton 结果
周二凌晨 Shipaton 比赛结果出来了，不出意外，没有获奖。如果获奖了，那就是三个大喜了。
但，说实话，很失望，消沉了一整天。唉，参赛报名时，嘴上说根本不在乎获奖，结果心口不一。
一共有三个奖项，最有可能赚钱奖，最佳设计奖，最 build in public 奖，每个奖项有一二三等奖。最有可能赚钱这个奖我是真心压根没信心去拿下，但是后两个奖项我还真的期待能够获奖。特别是 build in public ，我第一周每天都拍个简短的 vlog ，后来嫌费时费力就改成了每周一个 weekly vlog 。
最终获得 build in public 一等奖的是比赛期间一直在互相交流鼓励的一个印度小哥。我之前只关注了他的 X ，在比赛结果公布后我才知道，原来他每天都发一个进度视频到 YouTube ，难怪他拿这个奖了。得知自己获得了一等奖，他立刻买了机票飞去了旧金山，现场领奖，还参加各种研讨会，结识全球的优秀开发者，还参加播客录制，太羡慕了。
在上架后直至比赛结束，我的参赛 App 一个付费也没有（实际上，截止到写这篇周记，也仍然是零收入），所以我希望能够通过获得任意一个奖项来助力 App 的宣传。
诚如一个群友所说的，App 上架后只是第一步，只是九九八十一难的第一难而已。
iOS 18 的暑假作业
这周终于有空来给极简时钟和极简日记适配 iOS 18 的新特性了，主要就是支持深色和着色下的 App 图标，再就是增加控制中心的小组件。
今年的关于控制中心的适配，苹果的官方文档给的一点也不详细，最后还是靠 SO 和 Emote 的开发者的帮助下，才加入了这个新功能。
新版本上架后，很快就收到了多个用户的反馈：iOS 18 以下系统的小组件都不显示了，而且也无法添加。同时也收到了几个关于这个问题的差评。调查了一番，才知道「判断系统是否是 iOS 18 」的这句代码居然会在 iOS 18 以下的系统里引起崩溃……进而导致整个 App 的小组件无法加载。解决方法在这里：# WidgetBundleBuilder crash on #available(iOS 18.0) check，不得不吐槽一下苹果的软件品控也着实越来越堪忧了。
Phantom Types
这周看了 Vincent Pradeilles 的新视频：# Don't write this code! (use a Phantom Type instead 😌)视频很短，讲的就是如何避免不同语义但是相同类型的实例进行比较，由此我第一次知道「 Phantom Types 」这个东西。
搜了一下，原来几个知名的 Swift Blog 多年以前就都写过关于 Phantom Types 的文章了：
Swift by Sundell ，# Phantom types in Swift
Swift with Majid ，# Phantom types in Swift，# Building type-safe networking in Swift
Hacking with swift ，# How to use phantom types in Swift
一直以来，我在自己的代码里很少使用 swift 的泛型，主要是自己认识水平不高，怕弄巧成拙。现在有了 AI 了，感觉可以大胆使用了。写代码的快乐很大程度上就来自于重构后的优雅啊！
其他
备案下来了，Nut Goals 在国区也上架了。
读完了《蛤蟆先生去看心理医生》，顺便把相关的《人间游戏》和《人生脚本》加入了阅读清单。
恢复户外步行，趁这个转瞬而逝的秋季。

上面的过程是这样的吗？：
先对里面'"$code"'进行 shell 的解释。
解释成sed -i 's/111/0xFF/' $file后，sed 命令才开始工作。
另外主要对 shell 脚本不太熟，上面这个命令在$code 外面用了单引号和双引号，想彻底搞清楚这些用法，有什么官方链接吗？

我的想法是在插件上加一个搜索功能，做的简单一点就一个搜索框搜索提交者、提交信息、修订号所有信息，做的更精细一点则可以选修订号范围、然后选提交者、过滤提交信息。
可以按 VSCode 本身的搜索一样加上正则、大小写敏感、全词匹配这些东西，不过也不是很重要。
总的来看应该是比较简单的一个改动。然后我就找到 插件源码，看了一下是 node 做的，用的 yarn 包管理。尝试拿下来编译，但有些依赖已经弃用了，版本超旧，似乎很难动。我不是 node.js 或者前端大佬，只好祈祷高手出马。

        <id>https://www.v2ex.com/t/1077184#reply0</id>
        <link href="https://www.v2ex.com/t/1077184#reply0"/>
        <updated>2024-09-30T11:25:42.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[使用 Ballast 文件解决 Docker 容器磁盘占满无法启动的问题
背景
在容器开发工作中，售卖算力容器是一个很常见的需求，不管是用 Docker 容器还是 K8s Pod
交付。
其中有一个问题是：我们提供给用户的容器默认是没有限制 / 目录的，虽然说这些都是临时文件，真正需要持久化的文件我们可以提供分布式存储，然后挂载到用户容器的某个目录。
一个简单而有效的方式是使用 XFS 文件系统配合 --storage-opt 参数就能限制用户容器的 / 目录，也可以说是限制用户容器的系统盘大小。
问题
但是当用户长期使用一个容器，比如在容器里进行模型训练，会导致系统盘空间越来越小，当系统盘空间已经非常接近我们设置的大小时，例如限制系统盘大小为
20Gi ，用户已经使用了 19.9999Gi ，这时候当用户 Stop 了容器（关机），再次 Restart/Start 容器（开机）时很可能会失败。
报错信息如下：
Error response from daemon: mkdir /localData/docker/overlay2/7adae703b531d3e114cd171999e5502fe685e13835569b6f1d9fb31ab812773b/merged: disk quota exceeded 

这好像没什么好的解决办法，因为造成问题的原因是用户把容器当成了虚机来用，一般情况下我们也不会持久化用户容器的临时文件。
但目前确实遇到了这个问题，所以和朋友一番讨论后，想出来了一个思路。
实现思路
前段时间研究了一下 Golang 控制 GC 频率的方法，其中使用的是 ballast ，就像下面代码中：
初始化了一个生命周期贯穿整个 Go 应用的超大 Slice ，保证 GC 在 10G 的一倍时才被触发。
详情参考这篇文章 性能优化 | Go Ballast 让内存控制更加丝滑
package main

import "runtime"

func main() {
	ballast := make([]byte, 10*1024*1024*1024) // 10G

	// do something

	runtime.KeepAlive(ballast)
}

所以脑洞大开，我们能不能也用 ballast 的思想来为容器提供一个 ballast ，当容器磁盘不足时，我们手动减少这个 “压舱石”
的大小，这样就能能保证容器关机后，再次重启时，不会因为磁盘不足，导致失败了。
当然这样的操作是基于一个前提的，就是：
无论如何都不应该删除用户容器里的任何东西，即使是日志或者垃圾文件。
所以使用一个人畜无害的压舱石，可能是比较优雅的方式。
坏处也很明显，就是用户可以删除这块压舱石，并且用户 df -h 看到的空间是和实际购买的不一样。
具体实现
用户开通容器时
当用户开通一个容器，我们会限制用户容器的系统盘大小，比如说默认 20Gi
的空间，但是通过程序开通容器时，我们使用 --storage-opt size 限制时会把系统盘大小设置为 20Gi + 5Gi ，5Gi 的文件作为一个
ballast （压舱石）存在于用户的容器中。
当用户使用了 19.9Gi （实际情况下要比这个数字更接近 20Gi ） 的空间后，df -h 显示如下内容：
$ df -h
Filesystem                             Size    Used   
/                                      25Gi    24.9Gi

用户关机时
重点在 Stop 时，如果说 Used 已经很接近 Size 了，那么我们就调整 ballast 的大小，保证用户容器正确启动。
举个例子，当 Used 已经为 24.9Gi ，限制的大小为 25Gi ，我们 Stop 时，把 ballast 的大小减小 0.5Gi, 保证用户容器正确启动。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[干的时间长了越发现职场有很多很恶心的人，文中的他不全是同一个人，以本人后端开发的视角，举几个例子感受下：
《特点一：自己的问题，嘴硬不愿意承认》
  case 1 
  测试测出问题，来找他问：
  “这个东西，是不是没问题了”
  “没问题了，测过了”，
（他显然没测过）
  “现在有问题，问题是：xxxxxx”
  “不可能”....“哦 这是数据问题（ xx 问题，xx 导致的...）”
  （因为我是同组后端，很清楚，他是为了阐述原因，还是为自己辩解。总之就是，想找个理由，来表示自己导致的这个 bug 是有非常合理的原因的）
  case 2
  我发现他的代码有问题，跟他讲。
  “怎么会有问题，肯定没问题呀”....“你说的是，在极端情况下是有点问题，你这样的好处是 xx ，我这样的好处是 xx”。
  然后自己，偷偷改掉。
  在外人听他说的好像没问题，实际上他的明显不对，还嘴硬什么呢，我们环境整体和平，根本就没人跟你计较谁的责任，只是发现了问题，改掉就行了，而已。 就这个错了不愿意认，总想再说点啥，好让自己舒服的接受。
  别说为啥我闲的去看他代码，要不是出 bug 总需要我看 我才不管呢
《特点二：别人的问题，夸张放大来抬高自己》
  
  有次，别人改了问题让我忙部署到测试环境，我顺手帮点一下，去了厕所，回来他测试环境挂了，然后直接在群里 @我，“你不要打包部署操作完，就放那不管了，起码看一下运行成功没啊”
  
  结果问题是代码编译都不通过，但是我觉得这可以理解，不小心或者 idea 没有识别，就 push ，谁都有失误。
  但是令我发火的是，他在群里 @，而且说这句话，对于后端人来讲，部署之后验证是否运行成功，这是最基本的行为和职位操守了吧，感觉到超级不被尊重。直接想反怼了，旁边的人拉着我，说一个组的，别这样。稍微平和一下，越想越气，tmd 原来…]]></summary>

 For work, I had to compare the performance of the latest Ryzen 9 HX 370 (battery life, processor performance, graphics card, etc.) on different machines.
 So I compared the performance of the Zenbook UM5606 and Vivobook M5606 to be able to make a decision about which models to buy for the whole team.
 This led me to notice several things about the two machines I had in my hands, and I thought sharing this information could interest others (mainly Linux users).
 Indeed, I noticed a drastic drop in performance after installing bios 309 (released mid-September 2024) on the Zenbook UM5606, which now hardly justifies the price difference in my opinion.
 Have other users noticed the same reduction in performance in the last few days?
 Indeed, I think that the TDP initially limited …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[大约从 7 年前自建变得越来越困难，我就开始使用 本地-->机场-->Vultr 小鸡的方式在科学上网。PC 使用的是 V2ray cli ，安卓用的 Kitsunebi ，手写自定义配置。但最近这个方式越来越不好用了，最主要的就是 Vultr 的 IP 风险等级非常高。AI Boom 以来各大网站都在加强反爬，现在 Vultr 的 IP 甚至直接无法访问 Reddit ，而同样因为 AI ，英文搜索出来的博客等网站被内容农场充斥（反而被 V 友们嫌弃落后的日本互联网幸存，现在依然有许多高质量且频繁更新的博客），所以 Reddit 之类的 social media 反而成了高质量信息源，因此最近不得不越来越多地直接使用机场出口，Vultr 每月的$5 都浪费了。于是我今天在 V2EX 和 hostloc 搜了搜，但自己从碎片信息研究越研究越乱，Nekobox ，Hysteria2 ，trojan ，sagernet ，wireproxy ，xray 等等等等越来越搞不懂了，希望有人能指点一下。
我现在主要是两方面的问题：
1 、落地如何选择？我大概想到 4 种
- 放弃中转方案，机场直接落地。缺点：审计（主要是 BT ，禁 P2P 我理解，但走 HTTP 的 web source 也不行）、IP 共用多、IP 跳
- 维持现状 Vultr 小鸡。能解决上面列的缺点（有人说 Vultr 禁 BT ，但我用了快 8 年了从没有任何问题。我非法 BT 用的不多，却也用过 Vultr JP 下日本动画，并没有收到任何警告）。问题是它的 IP 虽然固定，风险等级实在高，而且它的价格放到机场里能升一个 Tier ，或者加个备用，体验都会好很多，感觉这$5 每月实在浪费。
- Warp+。在 V2EX 和 hostloc 都看到不少人说这个。缺点：wireguard 是 UDP ，机场可能不支持，限速，以及使用 V2ray 等 UDP over TCP 方案导致性能不好。
- Seedbox 等送的 VPN ，一般基于 OpenVPN 。毕竟是送的属于是不用白不用，而且支持 BT 。
2 、客户端
- 自建小鸡最成熟，我自己也最熟悉，继续我现在的方案或用 Clash Relay 都行。
- Wireguard （ Warp 用的协议） Nekobox 和 sagernet ，wireproxy 等都能较简单地支持，Nekobox 还支持手机，总体来说还是比较简单的。
- OpenVPN 就难了，我没找到任何关于这个的。我之前自己有弄过，但手机不知道该怎么弄。
- 最关键的问题：怎么分流？比如说我偶尔想在手机上用 Seedbox 送的 VPN 下个小种子，有办法给 BT 专门分流吗？这些送的 VPN IP 都很差，我肯定是不会长期用的。Warp 不能解锁的流媒体，有办法分流到机场去吗？ TG ，推特等风控严的，有办法固定好 IP 吗？
我现在感觉好像直接机场是不是已经是最好的了？机场的 IP 虽然会变，但固定国家问题应该不大吧？而且机场 IP 风险等级可比我现在的 Vultr 小鸡好太多了，风控这东西也是个黑盒子，自建的风险等级高和机场的 IP 变动+共用，不好说哪个影响大。BT 又该怎么办？我 BT 走代理主要是从 web source 走 HTTPS 协议下，不需要 BT 协议，也不需要和 tracker 联系，有没有什么办法走机场？这些问题我自己真的是越想越糊涂，希望有人能指点一下。]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey folks,
 I wanted to share a project I've been working on called pdf-namer. It's a Python CLI tool for Linux that helps organize your PDF files by giving them meaningful filenames. If you've ever had a folder full of cryptically named PDFs, this might be useful.
 Why I built it:
 As a business owner living in Germany, I deal with a ton of paperwork. Even in 2024, we get a ridiculous amount of letters. I use the GNOME scan app for digitizing documents, and it lets you run a script upon saving a file. So, I integrated pdf-namer into my workflow to automatically apply OCR and generate nice filenames. This makes managing documents a breeze, especially when using tools like Obsidian.
 I also recently migrated away from Evernote and ended up with about 1,500 poorly named PDFs. Running pdf-nam…]]></summary>

 If you open Google Lens on Android and hold down the shutter button, it'll record a short video that you can ask a question about. Here's a demo.
 If you're in a region where AI overviews are enabled, then you'll get an AI-generated response to your question.
 Google announced this feature back at I/O in May but it's started to roll out for some users in the last few days. LMK if you have it.
 (Sidenote: In the demo, I'm actually using the OnePlus Watch 2 and not the Watch 2R, but it wasn't too far off given what little I showed of it.)

Its not fancy, its not complex - it just records your keystrokes and repeats them as often as you want. Thats it. Nothing else. 
 I also added adjustable timing sliders, one for regular keystrokes and one for alt-tabbing from the macro recorder itself, so it catches special keystrokes and still allows to quickly execute regular typing. Works perfectly for me to quickly go through some Excel spreadsheets, or when logging my working hours in that stupid time tracking system we have.
 I didn't test it thoroughly and I'm sure theres a hundred ways to break it, and I'm sure theres some other useful features which could be added - PRs welcome!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[我在 /t/1076579 给出了 Clash 检测的在线工具，有评论希望我能说明以下其中的原理。
对此比较感兴趣的，可以阅读一下本文。
1. 基于跨域缺陷的利用
首先，需要了解两个术语：「同源策略」和「跨域资源共享」。
同源策略（ Same-origin Policy ）
当 B 网站的脚本，想请求 A 网站的资源时，浏览器的「同源策略」会禁止这一行为：防止 B 网站伪造您的请求，同时防止您在 A 网站上隐私的泄露。
举例：
www.google.com 下按 F12 ，输入 await fetch("https://bing.com") 回车，然后你会看到一条报错信息。浏览器默认阻止这一行为。
跨域资源共享（ CORS ）
而这一限制有时也会过于严格，因为 A 网站和 B 网站可能是来自同一家。因此 A 网站可以设置一个列表，允许特定的网站去访问它的数据。这就是「跨域资源共享」，这个列表就是「 Access-Control-Allow-Origin 」。
举例（不好的例子）：
Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *」，通配符允许了所有网站的脚本都能调用它。
www.google.com 下按 F12 ，输入 await fetch("http://127.0.0.1:9090") 回车，你会发现请求成功了。
Clash 为什么这么做？
Clash 系列核心没有用户界面（ GUI ），但它可以在本地运行一个 HTTP 服务，方便各种 GUI 通过 HTTP 请求调用它的接口。
其中一些 GUI 以网页形式呈现，例如「https://d.metacubex.one/」。Clash 系列核心必须开一个“后门”，也就是允许跨域资源访问，否则这些 GUI 将无法运作。
不过，这个“后门”显然开得过大了。应该增加一个配置项，只允许特定网站，而不应使用 * 通配…]]></summary>

 If you toggle this, the text changes to "automatically open after install" and the app in question will open after 5 seconds of being installed. A notification with a countdown will appear so you'll know the app is about to open.
 This feature was enabled by AssembleDebug a few weeks ago but is now rolling out for some users. LMK if you see it!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I don't know how to phrase it better but like half of my personality is linux. I have been daily driving linux for 7 years now. I have, over the years, developed a strong hate for Microsoft. My friends think I am weird for talking so much about linux and trying to "convert" them. It really makes me sad when I see posts from people sometime moving away from linux. In particular, One of my closest friend which I had converted earlier switched back to windows for some personal reasons and it really strained our relations. I don't convert others now but it was a significant part of my personality earlier and still recommend linux when people ask me for any tech advice about windows.
 I wish I was trolling with the above paragraph but I don't know I feel like I think too much about my OS. Using linux somehow gives me a moral high ground as in I perceive microsoft to be an evil organization. Interacting with people on linux communities gives me a sense of accomplishment, as if I am doing something meaningful. I concern myself a lot with the rise of dark patterns everywhere and feel like I am a white knight to defend and promote linux (for example this post from my history discusses in depth about my concerns for linux)
 I am writing this post because I feel like this might be very unhealthy, and want to hear the opinion of the community.
 Tldr: Do i need to touch grass?
 Edit: English is not my first language, this is a serious post. I have edited some things for clarity.

 I suppose there’s no real answer to my problem, but I just wanted to vent a bit by writing it down. I’ve been working in IT for 15 years, and for about 12 of those, I’ve been using Linux daily. First for work, then it became part of my home setup. Since then, I’ve been constantly going back and forth between Linux and Windows at home. Sometimes Windows sticks around a bit longer, other times Linux does, but every 3 to 6 months, I end up thinking: “Screw it, I’m going to wipe my PC and stick with OS that seems like it’ll make my life easier at that moment.”
 Believe me, I know about dual booting, and honestly,…]]></summary>

2.firefox 以及 floorp 使用 sideberry 插件后，有功能最强大的垂直标签页，但是 m2 air 用下来总是会有一些 
   问题，比如时间长点就转圈，有些网站莫名其妙的刷不出来（ Firefox 比 floorp 更严重，隐私模式选的都 
   是标准），改 css 后也可以做到隐藏垂直标签栏。
3.zen 浏览器也是 Firefox 内核，做到了自己的特色，可以同时隐藏垂直标签栏和标题栏，做到四个边都是 
   干净的线条，也做了主题功能，颜值不错，小缺点就是垂直标签栏的图标太小不容易点触过去，不知道 
   主题是否能微调。这个浏览器的分屏功能做的太抽象，不是直接分屏标签页而是给个小窗口让你输入网 
   址或者点预设的 YouTube 这类的网站。
4. Arc 用了大半年，还是老问题，颜值高但是垂直标签栏不支持图标化，只能选择完全隐藏或者拓展出 
    来，导致切换标签页总要等一下边栏弹出，太费劲，spaces 的设计很有想法，但是书签无法导出时间 
    久了迁移太费劲，只能用来做备用的或者娱乐的浏览器。
目前用的就是这几个浏览器了，主要还是使用 edge ，不知道大家都用垂直标签栏还是水平的标签栏？现在主用的浏览器有没有什么好用的推荐呢？]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[先介绍下目前的方案：
软路由是 4125 ，自编译的 ImmortalWRT ，专注拨号，不搞 AIO ，另有 TPLINK 作为 AP ；
NAS 是威联通的 251D ，硬盘是两块 4T 酷鹰；
basic 方案，所有数据存在盘位 1 ，HBS 定期向盘位 2 备份；
照片：定期从相机和手机上传，HBS 定期向盘位 2 备份；
影音书籍：不时找一些资源，会留下比较喜欢的内容，不备份。
Docker 有 Jellyfin, Komga, qBittorrent, Navidrome, CalibreWeb, TMM ；但数量好像有限制？最近 Jellyfin 获取不到 IP 用不了了，很奇怪；
云备份暂时没弄，有 office365 ，但 OneDrive 只有 1T 好像也不够，空间得至少 2T ，还在纠结用谁的服务。
大概两个月前盘 2 出现了坏道，加上盘 1 剩余空间只有 300G ，赶紧买了块 8T 银河，但后来出差就一直搁置了，现在有空了开始想接下来的方案：
方案一：先把数据都拷到新硬盘上，替换掉旧盘 1 ，旧盘 1 放到盘 2 位置上；
方案二：换成 4 盘位的成品 NAS ，比如 464C2 ，再买两块 8T 新硬盘，8T+8T 组 raid1 存重要数据，4T 的旧盘 1 存其他数据，最后一块 8T 做备份；
方案三：目前成品 NAS 用着还行，只有 docker 遇到一些问题，而且 CPU 占用总是很高；看了一些帖子，想到要不要自组 NAS ，有点想折腾但又感觉坑很多，且对软硬件的配置完全不了解。
目前想先按方案一来，保证数据别出问题，接下来是继续方案一还是转其他方案，想请大家帮我出出主意。]]></summary>

我想要实现的效果是 demo-parent 是 demo-project2 的子模块，demo-common 与 demo-server 是 demo-parent 的子模块
我的步骤是先创建这些模块，然后指定他们的依赖关系，在指定 demo-parent 为 demo-project2 的子模块时没有出现问题

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[目前根据各家自媒体的测试，以及我去 Apple store 进行的尝试，可以确认以下 2 个事实。
1.国行 iPhone 可以在 Qi2 模式下，以 360khz 实现 25w 快充；
2.国行 Apple Watch S10 ，兼容磁力快速充电器（ A2515 ），比国行特供充电器快，但是依旧无法实现快充；（本人也去 Apple Store 尝试过用自己的 S9 插到展示机的充电器上可以充电，说明目前展示台并非新款国行定制充电器，也侧面印证了国行 S10 可以使用非定制线进行充电）
根据国家无线电频率划分规定，苹果做了如下措施应对：
1.规定只限制发射端，不限制接收端，且 iPhone 支持有线充电方式，Qi1 充电的频率也符合国标，所以针对 iPhone ，苹果的处理简单粗暴，不上架新款 25w magsafe （不排除目前在售的 magsafe 会不会在将目前存量的销售完成后，也会调整为 7.5w 的 Qi 版），手机的充电模块不做任何调整；
2.因为 Apple Watch 仅支持无线充电，且 Apple Watch 的 2 个充电频率均不在国标允许的范围（ 326.5 kHz & 1.778 MHz ），苹果不得已给国行做了特供版 Apple Watch 和特供版磁力充电器。
以下为个人基于官网 info ，及上述自媒体对于 Apple Watch 的一点猜测：
1.Apple Watch S7 开始支持快充，且增加了一个频率 1.778MHz ，推测 Apple Watch 的快充是工作在 1.778MHz 下；
2.A2515 快速充电器兼容 S1 到 S6 的表，推测 A2515 也支持发射 2 个频率（ 326.5 kHz & 1.778 MHz ）；
3.国行 Apple Watch S10 使用特供版充电器速度最慢，使用 A2515 稍快，但仍然达不到外版的充电速度。推测 Apple Watch 的线圈设计仅能同时支持 2 个频率。国行增加了一个新的符合国标的频率（可惜没找到国行相关参数的页面），同时为了保证更好的兼容性，保留了 326.5 kHz 的慢充频率，去掉了 1.778 MHz 的支持。
所以在使用 A2515 等充电器的情况下，会以 326.5kHz 频率工作，充电速率倒退到 S6 ；如果用特供充电器，充电速率甚至不如 S6 。
4.国行 A2515 仍在销售，但是根据国标要求，推测在销售完目前生产的，也会下架。

阻断范围暂时不明。
最初感知到这件事是因为看网上的 iptv无法正常缓冲。
看这个 iptv 已经有一段时间了，一直是很正常的，突然某天开始就不能正常观看，要么打不开，要么缓冲一两秒就不能再缓冲。检查链接地址后发现是国内东北某地的 ipv6 地址。
某日晚高峰试了下某个 ipv6 测试网址，得到了奇怪的结果。
正常情况下可以获得 20/20 ，结果当时试了几十次，压根不会有 20/20 ，期间还会随机出现连接被重置的提示。
检查过对该站点的 dns 解析，并未发现异常。
下面是奇葩的 0/20 截图。]]></summary>

这套教程叫做「 Chrome 插件全栈开发实践」，内容包含 Chrome 插件开发和 Next.js 全栈开发，教程包含图文教程和全套源码。
这套教程包含了 PH Copilot( https://phcopilot.ai/) 的完整开发实践。当时开发这个插件的目的之一就是写出海全栈产品开发教程，所以在写教程的时候，我对每一个功能进行 code review 和代码优化，然后编写开发教程，整个过程花费了 3 周。
教程和源码包含的主要技术知识：
Plasmo 开发 Chrome 插件
Next.js 全栈开发 Web 端与服务端
AI 对话功能开发
Firebase 授权和数据库应用（免费）
Paddle 支付功能集成
[我想说说这份源码和教程的价值] 
教程从实践角度出发，从 0 开始构建项目、搭建 Chrome 插件模板、开发功能模块，每一个步骤都单独讲解，可以帮助你渐进式学习。
学会专业的代码设计方式。

Flux AI Image Maker is a free AI image generator that has gained popularity for its ability to create images that rival those produced by Midjourney. With its advanced algorithms and models, Flux AI can generate hyper-realistic images that can leave viewers questioning their authenticity.
Understanding the Technology Behind Flux AI Image Maker
The secret to Flux AI Image Maker's impressive results lies in the Flux Realism Lora model. This model is trained on high-quality, refined images, allowing it to elevate AI image generation to new heights of photo realism. However, achieving these results is not as straightforward as it may seem. Users often encounter challenges when trying to replicate the hyper-realistic quality seen in various online examples.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I found a little Trick when trying to dualboot OpenBSD when making a custom entry i couldnt find the EFI path since unknown file System but rage quitting after setting the root of the ESP booted OpenBSD this moment it hit me.
 Using GRUB as a UEFI Frontend for OpenBSD Booting
 Instead of making GRUB handle the full boot process for OpenBSD, you can use it as a simple frontend that hands off control to the UEFI bootloader. This is particularly useful because it eliminates the need to find the specific path to the EFI file, which can sometimes be tricky.
 How it works:
 GRUB lets you specify the root of the EFI partition where the OpenBSD bootloader resides.
 After setting the correct root, GRUB can simply exit, handing control back to UEFI.
 UEFI, which is already configured with the OpenBSD bootloader, will automatically boot OpenBSD.
 This method doesn’t change the boot order, and GRUB serves as a frontend, making UEFI boot the system without having to manually specify the EFI file path.
 GRUB Configuration: In your /etc/grub.d/40_custom file, add the following entry:
 menuentry "OpenBSD" { set root=(hd0,6) # Replace (hd0,6) with the correct partition for OpenBSD's EFI exit # Return to UEFI, which will boot OpenBSD }
 Explanation:
 set root=(hd0,6): This sets the root to the partition where the OpenBSD EFI loader is located. You should replace (hd0,6) with the actual partition that holds the OpenBSD EFI loader.
 exit: Instead of chainloading or directly booting the EFI file, this exits GRUB, returning control to the UEFI firmware. Since UEFI already knows how to boot OpenBSD from that partition, it will handle the boot process automatically.
 Benefits:
 You avoid the hassle of locating the exact EFI file path.
 GRUB becomes a simple interface for managing your boot options without having to configure complex boot paths.
 UEFI handles the actual booting, ensuring a more straightforward and error-free boot process.

符合自己兴趣的电台不好找，尤其是下午下班的这段时间。
珠江第一线
珠江第一线，朝朝陪你饮早茶！
早上的选择中个人尤其喜欢珠江经济台的《珠江第一线》，它的播出时间是周一到周五的 07:30-09:00，是珠江经济台重点打造的一档粤语民生新闻名牌节目，李嘉、淼钧、郑达等一众名嘴的组合，加上独具的广府文化韵味，针砭时弊，作风硬朗，嬉笑怒骂，亦庄亦谐，让人在上班的路上更加放松。
《珠江第一线》开播之时，就在广东广播界率先提出“打造听众上班路上的新闻资讯大餐”的口号。节目立足民生视觉，着重在内容碎片化上下功夫，让海量资讯更有层次感，更适合伴随性收听的人群；另外增加生活化话题、软性资讯，讲老百姓身边的故事，塑造老百姓“贴心老友”节目品牌形象；同时强化新闻时评的针对性，聘请最强广播评论专家团队，与市民评论员联袂，每天对社会热点话题进行精辟点评；节目主持人也一改传统的新闻节目播报方式，使用个性化的“说新闻”，节目过程还不时插播上班路上的交通、天气状况，使节目更接地气，更具亲和力。
放工路上
下班时间段的选择，要说十分喜欢的节目目前没找到，虽然会听同样是珠江经济台的《珠江晚高峰》，但找不到《珠江第一线》的舒适感。]]></summary>

 Now, a FAB appears in the bottom right to open a new tab. Previously the button to open a new tab was located in the top left or behind the overflow menu in the top right, both of which might have been hard to reach.
 This change has been available for some people in beta/dev versions of Chrome for a few weeks now, but today is the first I'm seeing it in the stable version without any manual flag overrides.

安同开源社区是爱好者驱动的国内 Linux 发行版社区，成立于 2011 年末，网页可参考 https://aosc.io 。目前主线架构支持为 AMD64 ，ARM64 ，RISCV64 ，LoongArch64 与 PPC64EL 。
但社区还有星霞 OS 项目 https://aosc.io/afterglow ，通过精简特性、配置调优和软件精选等手段，为各类老旧设备提供持续软件和技术更新，通过持续维护良好体验和性能让老旧设备焕发新生、让用户们“重拾旧爱”。目前星霞 OS 已经成功在 ARMv4 ，ARMv6 ，ARMv7 ，i486 ，sparc64 等众多架构点亮，近期正在策划重构。下图为近日在最新处理器上启动 i686 架构系统的截图。

除了原先支持的架构外，社区目前对安腾比较感兴趣，但安腾架构较为特别，无法软件模拟。考虑到安腾目前仍有一些设备流通，如果有朋友安腾架构的设备，可以希望可以借用或购买。因为第一代支持较为困难，希望是安腾 2 系列的设备。也欢迎爱好者加入社区交流。]]></summary>

With more free time, I finally implemented all features I wished for in 1.0.0 and made a lightweight C++ single-header version for moments when google/benchmark is too much.
Hope this library helps you as much as it does me.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[我刷了波抖音，发现韭菜们打算下周一拼命往里冲，不少打算贷款去冲。
我现在越来越笃定，下周一会涨停了。理由，一是韭菜们往里冲，要给他们个甜头，二是国庆节了，机构要让大家过个好节日。
节前的股市大涨培养了韭菜们的信心，节后的股市很可能微涨或者横盘。这时候，投机者们跟机构开始做空了——先赚韭菜们的一笔钱，让韭菜们高位接盘。韭菜们呢，一方面不舍得止损，另一方面知道必涨，所以抱着不放手，但他们处于各种原因不加仓。
股市狂跌前夕，机构们缓慢入场来接盘超跌的长债 ETF ，等到大盘跌够了，在开始横盘的前夕卖出，赚一波常债的钱。
接下来大盘慢慢涨，所有人开始各凭本事捡钱了。最终，韭菜们会解套，但是赚得并不多。
总结，接下来半年有三拨钱：
韭菜们的入场费
超跌的长债利润
央行的投放
外加，每年的春节前会暴跌，第四波是这笔钱。
囧，我的第一股 QQQ 就是这个韭菜心态，现在还没解套:-(]]></summary>

不想去的客观因素：这家国企大领导面试的时候打压 pua 厉害，又嫌弃学历又觉得本地人不上进，还因为有空挡期被嫌弃在家啃老；其次，公司行业似乎比较夕阳...业务发展前进不看好
主观原因：薪酬谈下来很低，非常低。年包 15 不到，基本月薪中还有一部分是年底发的（年终奖）意味着到手每月几千块钱

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[亲爱的朋友们，你是否曾经为背单词而烦恼？是否觉得用手机时有很多零碎时间没有利用上？
今天，我要给大家带来一个神奇的方法——免装单词 App ，在 iPhone 锁屏随机显示单词！这样，你每天解锁手机的时候，都能顺便瞟一眼单词，日积月累，词汇量自然水涨船高！
有些背单词软件可能有提供这种功能，但通常有一些问题：单词列表不受自己控制，显示的内容无法自定义，搞不好还收费。
今天我就来给大家介绍一种免费实现自定义锁屏单词小组件的办法。
需要的工具
iPhone ；
Scriptable
Scriptable 是一款 iOS 应用程序，允许用户使用 JavaScript 自动化构建和自定义桌面或锁屏小部件。
得益于优秀的 Scriptable （苹果应用商店的开发者工具类排名前十），我们只需要写一点简单的基于 JavaScript 的脚本，就能干很多事情。
脚本代码
借助 ChatGPT ，把需求描述一番，很快就有了如下脚本：
// 指定 RSS 源的 URL
const url = "https://politepol.com/fd/f1NYOd8OAcsA.xml";

// 使用 fetch 来获取 RSS 数据
let req = new Request(url);
let rssData = await req.loadString();

// 输出 RSS 数据到日志
console.log(rssData);

// 使用正则表达式解析 RSS 中的内容，ChatGPT 给的参考代码中变量名为 title ，这里实际选择读取摘要。
let titles = [];
let regex = /<description>(.*?)<\/description>/g;
let match;
while ((match = regex.exec(rssData)) !== n…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi guys,
 If you look around, you will notice that many Linux distros, which are primarily aimed at “normal” desktop users, are based on Ubuntu. The most prominent examples here are probably Linux Mint, Pop!OS and Zorin OS.
 But why exactly is this the case? And why not use Fedora, for example, or, to give another example, OpenSuse? What makes Ubuntu better than the others?
 I did a bit of research into the differences between Fedora and Ubuntu and found the information that the packages in Fedora are more up-to-date and those in Ubuntu are often older or outdated. That would actually be a point in Fedora's favor.
 I have also had this experience. VirtualBox from the Ubuntu repositories is still on version 6.1 or so, the latest is now 7.0 or already 7.1 (I don't know exactly but definitely 7). And VirtualBox is the kind of software where you are forced to install it from there, because only then will it work. If you download it as a flatpak, you still have to set it up for the distro which is very complicated.
 Apart from that, you always find relatively different information about the two, such as that Fedora is supposed to be more stable than Ubuntu and has fewer bugs, whereas elsewhere you read that Fedora is supposed to be buggy. Then you read that Fedora is more complicated than Ubuntu, then somewhere else you read that both are equally simple. Just tons of information that somehow contradict each other.
 But there must be some reason why the people who wanted to bring out a new distribution thought they'd rather use Ubuntu as a basis than Fedora, for example.
 What exactly makes Ubuntu better than Fedora or other distributions? Or is Ubuntu actually not the best base for a distro and not worth the hype? What would be the best base then?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[这一轮 A 股的惊天大阳线，好像把所有人都叫醒了，情景和 2014 年几乎是一毛一样。
我当时工资只有 4000 多，还要给弟弟交学费，一直没存款。
所有的同事都去开户炒股，我也没参与，后来我发小的老婆，买了 8 万的中车，亏到 2 万多，非常绝望，股票账户丢给我玩，看能不能回本，两年左右翻到 5 万左右，之后几年就和股票没有任何关系了，我自己都没开过户。
20 年因为家庭一些原因，欠了十几万，21 年底差不多还清了，没房没车，30 几岁，面对人生非常非常的绝望。
22 年我刷信用卡套现 20 万进场，到现在，我在 A 股总获利 100 万多点吧，今年到现在收益是 30 个点左右。
自己挣了一点钱，也看到很多人亏得血本无归。
有从 20 万亏到 3 万的，从 3 万亏到 4 千的。

股市是零和博弈的地方，是合法的赌场，并不是发福利的地方，不存在我不贪心，只挣一点就离场的那种情况。
你只有足够贪心，赌性够大才又资格玩这个游戏。
每一次你买入，就是买定离手，就是交出了所有筹码。
知行合一是最重要的事情。
如果你要入市，除了理解这是一个赌场，最关键的就是知道如何离场。
你投了 10 万：
到 12 万你卖不卖？
卖了之后你离场么？
挣的钱你要干什么花？
到 15 万呢？到 20 万呢？到 30 万呢？
卖了之后你离场么？
挣的钱你要干什么花？

如果到 8 万呢？
你卖不卖？
卖了之后你离场么？
离场之后亏的钱怎么补？
如果到 6 万呢？
你卖不卖？
卖了之后你离场么？
离场之后亏的钱怎么补？
如果到 2 万呢？
你卖不卖？
卖了之后你离场么？
离场之后亏的钱怎么补？

以上，写在 A 股三根大阳线之后，我也预感，这一轮和 2014 年是非常相似。]]></summary>

首先是发现，开机启动的 aida ，报错了，错误信息大致是某个内存地址不可读，然后 aida 卡死，需要杀进程重启。
于是跑了下 tm5 ，大约半小时报错。忘了截图了。
618 配的电脑，刚开始玩游戏闪退，tm5 不过测。售后换了 2 次，tm5 过测，不过地平线 5 还是闪退过一次。
个人猜想：内存，特别是开 xmp ，比较依赖主板设置。因为 intel 微码，我的 MSI z790 zero 升级过 BIOS 。
但是我猜是不是 msi 新版 bios ，没弄好内存兼容配置。
一开始 618 装机时，我这主板是支持这个内存的。
看到 BIOS 那上百个参数就发怵，我还是先关掉 XMP 吧。]]></summary>

这里程序员多，那你一定知道一套代码只有 5%是核心，其余 95%都是陪衬，你也知道你的电脑/手机 CPU 只有不超过 5%的时间在干活，其余都在睡觉。
这个原则，超越了计算机，存在于整个宇宙的每一个角落，对于投资来说，只有 5%的时间在涨，其余 95%都在横盘和下跌。
你只有两条路：
1.接受宇宙法则，获得 80%的成功几率
2.修改宇宙法则，拼尽脑汁，预测/追随/逃避, 最大限度提升快乐时间/痛苦时间占比，最终让情况变得更糟，获得 100%的出局概率
只要在股票市场，你就会持续受到不可抗力把你往腰斩线推、把你往膝盖斩线推、最终把你往出局线推，你只需要专注最后一条线。每一次试图逃避腰斩和膝盖斩的尝试，只会加快你通往出局线的速度
本人投资前 3 年，4 度在腰斩和回本直接拉扯(未来必定还有更多), 最终终于悟了，或者说服了！
股市千变万化，恒定不变的只有成功者比例，5%。
你必须给自己找一个理由，你凭什么超越 95%的人，我给自己的理由就是我的心态已经赢了 95%的人。每个不认同的我的人，都不知道自己在干嘛，最终都会落到 95%的类别]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[下面这段 TS 代码，ret 里面的数值是 1 ，所以返回的应该是 Promise<number>，不是要求的 Promise<loginResponseData>，为啥运行的时候没错.
export function reqLogin(data: loginForm): Promise<loginResponseData> {
  const ret = request.post<any, loginResponseData>(API.LOGIN_URL, data)
  ret.then((result) => console.log(result)) // 1
  return ret
}

这是封装 axios 后, 响应拦截器的代码, 响应返回的 1
request.interceptors.response.use(
  (response) => {
    const a: any = 1
    return a
  },
  (error) => {
    ElMessage('oops')
    return new Promise(error)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, I've been looking for resources on reading about how things (eg scheduling) are implemented in linux, and I found a book which seems to cover a lot of topics in depth - The Linux Architecture - Mauerer, Wolfgang but its based on the kernel release - 2.6.24 release (January 2008). 
 I just wanted to get an idea if it would be completely redundant reading it because of the content being out of date, and would also love references to other materials that people have found useful!
 Thanks!

2 ，surge 什么价格，quanatumult 两代又是什么价格。这类 app 的主流人群是什么，不必多说了吧？真的有那么“纯技术人员”的“纯工具类型”软件需求吗？
3 ，拿着一个白菜价格的 app ，去跟顶级收费的 app 比较功能，不觉得可耻吗？老板要求你 3000 月薪做 30 万的活，你乐意吗？
4 ，要说新协议，功能的增加，怎么不去扒一下 surge 的开发历程。
5 ，好了，说到这里有人该拿 loon 什么的来比较了，虽然我也没用过，也没去了解价格，但是，世界上有卷王，你要当吗？
ps:这个表格肯定不完善，也可能有纰漏，很多信息是靠 surge 的官方网站公告（ https://community.nssurge.com/d/1991-surge-ios ）和 twitter/gogole 完善的。至于 quantumult ，在价格面前，我不知道是否有必要费时间去拆的这么细，也欢迎有人能完善]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've been reading and re-reading Anatomy of a system call trying to understand the low-level actions that occur when a syscall is issued by a user-space program. I'm not sure I have a complete understanding, but the article describes that when a syscall is issued, the following happens:
  
The machine switches to kernel-mode
 
The instruction pointer jumps to the address of system_call, which is implemented in / arch / x86 / kernel / entry_64.S
 
The kernel executes the corresponding system call handler function specified by RAX
 
The result is saved to RAX and the kernel switches back to the user-space
  
My main confusion is that in later versions of Linux, the arch/x86/kernel/entry_64.S file does not exist. How should learners keep up to date with the true anatomy of a system call?

 [千元 4K 逆天色准，但首发就背刺？？红米 A27U (无 TypeC 版)详细测试报告 [走心点屏] ]  https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1bZ421L7E1/?share_source=copy_web&vd_source=14734ddb4d34010d162ca77099d91106
主要两个问题
1 、视频 01:11-01:35 介绍说 DP 接口连 PC 的 N 卡，会出现动态范围受限，屏幕发灰，N 卡配置项里动态范围调成完全就可以解决，我不懂这种动态范围受限会不会在 MAC 上出现，要是连 MAC 点亮后发灰我也没地方改设置啊，A27U-typec 一线连接口使用的是 DP 显示协议，有没有大佬告知一下这是不是仅 N 卡才会出现的问题。
2 、第二个问题可能显得太较真，TypeC 一线连是带 90W 供电的，我的 macmini 不支持 TypeC 供电，那么显示器的供电模块一开机就识别出来不触发供电吗（有啥协议还是什么机制？学习一下），如果是带电的，时间久了会不会伤主板？]]></summary>

诚心求这里的车主们帮我推荐，就是您家自己在开的车推荐一下或者排除一下
城里、高速都经常跑，但是距离不远，长一点也就是一两百，两三百公里。还没有自驾游过，想买了车有空去自驾游玩。
车的话是家里用，我和父母都一起用，本来家里有辆开了很久的油车，但是它已经很老了，不好开。而且父母去工作老是骑电动车，因为想省油钱嘛。我想着买个电车，他们不想着省油基本上就可以天天开车去工作。（我不需要天天开车去工作）
主要考虑开车是不是基本的舒适、方便、安全，因为也会经常跟父母一起出门，所以车坐起来体验不能糟糕，正常就行。都是一些基本的需求。另外想买电车的另一个原因是智驾，我个人不喜欢开车，所以希望开车能省心省事，就需要智驾。
自己也是看了很久，下不去手。网上看太多都麻木了，总感觉大多数收了钱测评发言的，听不到真实信息。看多了就感觉是垃圾堆里找东西。
本来看 model y 很心仪，但网上又说这个车 ap 驾驶有很多事故、坐车颠的厉害、很激进地搞纯视觉把雷达超声波都移除了、出了事特斯拉又不负责任，就有点怕。至于所谓的毛坯装修，倒是没有感觉，感觉挺好的。好难选]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[楼主的群晖 DS 920+ 最近硬件挂了，需要返厂维修，所以又搭建了一个 TrueNAS 系统。白裙的套件替换情况是：
最新的 TrueNAS scale 24.10 beta 可以用原生 docker ，可以直接写 docker compose 配置文件
Photos 套件可以用 mt photos 上位替代，更好用
自动 smart 、scrub 、邮件通知、UPS 、smb 、webdav 等都支持
使用 DDNS + ipv6 替代群晖的 QC
相较于性能羸弱的群晖，目前的 TrueNAS 我挺满意的。但是目前缺少白裙服务的最后一环，就是它的 Drive 套件。
我的需求是：
资料需要存在文件系统上，可以通过 smb 操作文件、快速拷贝，软件自动识别（ inotify ）
提供搜索和预览功能
我尝试了几个替代方案：
seafile 会把文件分片储存，无法通过 smb 等服务进行访问
nextcloud 功能上比较全面，但是用户直接操作文件系统上的文件后，无法自动检测到变动，需要手动触发 scan 操作
直接使用 webdav 、smb 等无法提供全文搜索的能力（如搜索 pdf 里的内容）
想请问下非群晖系统的大家，目前市面上的软件（接受买断制付费）有什么可以平替群晖 Drive 的吗？]]></summary>

我平时不善言谈，人情世故了解也少。熟人面前还好，生人前面不知所措。
一方面担心怎么和对象父母聊什么，一方面不知道怎么称呼她们家。他爸叫叔叔还是爸，他弟弟妹妹叫名字还是弟、妹。在她家待几天该怎么相处。
我和对象关系挺好的，她家里也逐渐不反对我（我是山东的，她是河南的，比较远，女方家里原来不希望远嫁）。双方经济都一般，也算是门当户对了。
一方面我还是不自信，另一方面对于社交这件事我还是恐惧，恐惧来自于未知，不懂得人情世故。
小时候啥也不懂，人情上如同白痴，研究生毕业后才开始通过电视剧来了解人情世故（岁月、遥远的救世主、87 版红楼梦），以及一些 up 主（统一的奸商之路、啊粥粥啊粥），以及一些书（被讨厌的勇气，好人只会越当越委屈）。

对于千兆网卡，128MB 是最大速度。
但是备份的时候速度基本上大文件是这么个速度~8.46 MB/s （ time machines log 里显示），在 activity monitor 看发送最大是 13MB 左右。
因为是备份负载，对于小文件多的情况下，速度 1MB/s 左右，可以理解。对于大文件，如果纯粹很大文件，达到 90-100MB 左右应该是理想速度（考虑到虚拟化开销等）。考虑实际上的真实文件分布，大文件传输达到 50MB 也就知足了。
但看我实际发现的大文件速度，平均才 8-10MB/s 。 
以上我是在 macos 客户端如下条件下的性能数据。

其实早在 8 月 23 号 Arc 就已在 X 上发帖说“Arc Search coming to Android”了（ https://imgur.com/eag5OGj ），只不过到现在已经过了一个月的时间还没有发布正式版，看 Reddit 上的老哥说目前还是挺多 bug 的，估计等到正式版还得要一段时间。这里还是想吐槽一下 TBC ，Windows 与 Android 较之于 MacOS 与 iOS 真是收到了不公平对待，Arc 在前两者平台上不仅发布时间要晚于后两者，使用体验上还要比后两者差不少，开发者都这么优先对待苹果的吗？说到这 Orion Browser 也是，Only available for MacOS and ios （ https://imgur.com/Cmvqcol ），什么时候 Windows 与 Android 才能受到与苹果系统一样的待遇！
Arc 是一款非常不错的浏览器，它的优点很多，油管上也有很多博主介绍过，就不再说了，缺点的话用下来感觉它的响应速度稍慢，不过还是不妨碍去使用这款浏览器的，也很推荐各位 V 友去尝试（估计有不少 V 友已经在用了）。]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[因为想把工作和日常生活分开，所以准备了两个微信号。
一开始是两个 iphone 双持（ 15 pro + 13 mini ）
但是每天带两个手机真的有点麻烦，而且另外一个手机的消息不能通过 apple watch 提醒，容易漏消息
折腾了一下，目前的双开基本没啥问题了。
自签微信
在网上找了原版仅砸壳的 ipa ，没有添加插件，用 sideloadly 自签，仅修改了包名，然后设置 iphone 无线连接 mac ，更新签名就可以通过 wifi 连接，不用连数据线，基本无感。
通知转发
自签的微信不挂后台没有通知，比较简单的方法是用一个安卓平板，同时登陆平板微信和手机微信，然后用 bark 转发消息，但是我有 ipad 了，也不想专门买个安卓平板，成本又高，供电也是问题。
正好有一个黑苹果小主机，在 mac 端登陆微信（工作原因不需要在电脑上登陆微信，所以不会被挤下线），通过 python 脚本，读取 mac 的微信通知，通过 bark 转发到手机上。
这个脚本还比较简陋，如果有需要我可以放到 github 上面，然后 mac 需要设置不锁屏（锁屏了好像就没有通知了）
目前测试了一周，消息转发很及时，延迟在十秒左右。
通知跳转
因为是通过 bark 发送消息，点进消息会自动跳转到 bark 而不是微信，所以通过 bark 自定义 url 的功能，先用用 url 调起快捷指令，然后用快捷指令调起工作微信，实现点击 bark 消息可以自动打开工作微信的效果。
这部分目前还存在的问题是，通过快捷指令调需要跳转两步，如果都没挂后台的话需要唤醒 bark 和快捷指令两个 app ，效率较低。考虑过修改工作微信的 scheme 来实现一步直接跳转，但目前还不知道如何在 sideloadly 中修改。
关于封号
登陆自签的微信后，电脑端的微信最开始两天每天早上被踢下线，后面几天就一直正常了，没有用插件的话，应该还好]]></summary>

?si=tN8QENC63DF2Ygby
先说明一下硬件环境：普通的 Dell 笔记本电脑，虽然 Dell 也有生产 chromebook ，但我这台不是，所以我没有原装 chromeos 的镜像。11 代 i5 ，有 RTX 独显但主板没有独显直连，无论内屏外屏都是核显控制。
这视频看起来像是三哥程序员搞出来的方法，原理只看懂一点：大致就是用 wsl 把系统本体文件、依赖框架和引导信息合成一个安装镜像，然后用 rufus 直接写进硬盘里，跟 win to go 差不多。
我用 DG 看了一下分区结构，发现系统分区只给了 4G ，后面上百 G 的未分配空间。用 DG 自带的调整功能无法为其扩容，显示文件表错误。
如标题所示，怎么解决这种奇葩故障？
PS:我试过 chrome flex ，chromeos 的通用版本，安装过程跟用 U 盘装 Windows 差不多，但毕竟是个残次品版本，不支持 playstore 也不能装 apk ，所以我只能像视频中那样根据 CPU 型号匹配镜像版本。]]></summary>

I could use a safe heaven for my files in the future. or let it be and see if there is a point i will need it? even though I got all the documents needed here on Linux. maybe I should sell it? i bet i can get a good 20-30$ out of it. yeah just want to know what are all your opinions about your old OS drives.

 Many HP Laptops have a light on the F6 key (or near there) which also functions as the Mute button when combined with the function key. It is a known issue this mute LED light does not work consistently across many models on Linux. I have put together information that I have gathered from deep searching the internet that works on my laptop model, an HP Pavilion Gaming Laptop 15z-ec0, with Realtek ALC285. This is not the only model that this solution works for, but I do not have a comprehensive list of models that this will work for.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello all,
 I had previously made this post (HERE) looking for assistance with creating a local Linux based network to wipe the hard drives of old laptops before they are recycled. The situation has changed slightly and I am looking to see if the plan I have would still work:
  
In addition to the laptops we now also have a couple of old Server storage units with HDDs that its unknown if they have been cleared or not. 
 
There is also some old Server Equipment that includes an HP Proliant DL360p and 2 Aruba 3810M Switches
 
 The original plan was to create a small local network with some daisy chained 8 port switches and detect and wipe the laptops using one as a control with an Ubuntu distro on it and use the following process to wipe the drives:
  
Use nmap to discover hosts on your network
 Use the results to populate an ansible inventory
 Use ansible to wipe the drive of every host in the inventory file
 Put all that on a loop in a small script
  
What I'm now wanting to know is if that I can use the above server equipment using the same above process on a bigger scale as I now have to take into account the storage units. 
 Again we are doing this due to our own security concerns regarding the data, any help of direction pointing to learning materials is appreciated.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[尊敬的 V2EX 朋友们：
我的母亲被银行工作人员诱导购买了大量保险，导致其耗尽毕生积蓄和退休金。今年九月，家人才偶然发现这一情况，整理保单和家庭收入后，发现她仍需缴纳大额保费给银行，且可能存在 9 万元的资金缺口难以填补。
浏览了社区类似经历的主题后，花了 9 天时间跟银行协商、跟监管部门投诉，希望能取回本金，解除合同。但银行一直不予正面回应，也不愿协助调查。感觉疲惫不堪，因此希望向各位有见识的朋友寻求帮助（必有酬谢）
以下是事情的概要：
事件经过
妈妈 10 年前就开始买理财和保险了，银行经理推荐她买的都是些很抽象的产品（约等于年利率仅 0.6%的 5 年定期存款）。
近些年银行经理可能感觉妈妈这只羊很好薅，于是诱导妈妈购买了多份高额保险，包括 5 份终身寿险、1 份年金险、多份长期保险（最长的 24 年到期）。这些产品收益低得搞笑；而且 10 年内想取回钱，不仅没有收益，反而损失很大。
维权困境
律师咨询：无果，保险合同有效。
银行方面：请求其提供双录等关键证据，被无视。坚持要求已对银行产生心理阴影的妈妈去面谈。
政府部门：都建议找 12378 。
12378 投诉：投诉单（包括诉求）被原封不动地转交给银行，并且在前天就结案了。
现状
银行在 9 月 21 日就说“正在核查销售过程”，然后说“跟保险公司一直在沟通”，但至今没有告知任何进展、信息，也不给协商方案。
跟银行询问了两次，问能不能在 12378 委托独立调解组织来调解，银行都不予理睬。
银行反复要求妈妈去面谈。把授权委托书发给银行后（妈妈授权我全权处理），银行委婉地质疑之前的沟通是否反映妈妈的真实意愿（实际上是真实的），更加要求妈妈亲自去见面。但是看妈妈现在的状况，恐怕很容易被击垮、被忽悠。
妈妈拿不出任何证据，被银行的人忽悠的时候没录音。
今天银行说可以“推荐一个专业的银行业调解机构”，12378 上的调解机构他们又不认可，请问这样是有陷阱吗？
恳请帮助
面对银行的推诿和自身的无力，恳请 V2EX 的朋友们能够伸出援手：
如果您有类似经历或了解相关法律法规，请不吝赐教，您的每一条建议都弥足珍贵。
如果您知道如何有效维护自身权益，如何与银行进行交涉，也欢迎您慷慨分享您的经验。
银行工作人员的可疑操作
提供误导性信息，夸大收益。
规避监管： 将口头宣传、付款和合同签署分开进行，只在合同签署时录音录像
使用煽动性语言： 利用“存款没利息”、“内部人员都在买”、“产品即将下架”等话术，制造紧张气氛，迫使母亲决定。
阻挠家人知情：暗示妈妈“不要麻烦子女”。
混淆概念：将购买保险与存款简单类比，使妈妈误以为自己的行为跟将钱存进银行一样。
代填虚假信息： 替妈妈在合同上代填年收入等信息，且明显高于实际情况。
即使妈妈明确说会提前解除保险合同（“三五年内就要用钱”），仍然隐瞒提前解除保险合同可能产生的损失。
酬谢
有帮助的回复必点感谢
如果这事能顺利解决，给 V2EX 朋友们奉上大红包
万一还能拿到利息的话，一定跟妈妈商量，利息大头归朋友们]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey folks!
 I'm Xavier and a solo game dev since 2017. I use Godot, Inkscape, Blender and Krita. I'm used to this subreddit, and I like to read it! I'm more of a lurker usually, but as I'm making games I have to talk about my games, so I post quite often on reddit but here! Because I know you folks, I know you're not looking for some shiny stuff, but for something that respect your privacy, because I'm one of you using Librewolf on Debian for example.
 Anyway, my journey started in 2017, and my first game released in 2019, while the second one didn't went well. I'm about to release my third game (april 7th 2025).
 I have a spare laptop that runs windows for some testing, and a VM that runs MacOS just in case, but all of my computers run either Debian or Raspbian. I host my code on a raspberry pi using Gitea, and I share most of the code I write on github/gitlab. I also contribute to some tools that I use (godot and terraform for example).
 Today is a really big day to me since Steam accepted to put one of my game on their front-page. From a game that had around 5 to 20 players, it went to almost 600! Selling over 5000 copies within 24h. That's crazy and I really want to thank you all for making this happen!
 Of course I work my ass off to make it happen, but I don't have enough time to make an OS as solid as Linux. I don't have enough time to make a game engine as great as Godot. I don't have enough time to make a tool as AWESOME as Inkscape (I really love this one). I don't have enough time to make a 3D tool/VCE/... as incredible as Blender! I'm just talking about those tools, but I could have talked about Librewolf, KDEPlasma, Terminator, nano, ssh, git, gitea ... all of those tools/libs are great and I'm glad they exist.
 Anyway, I'm sure this post is going to get buried but I really wanted to thank you all for making all of this to happen.
 Ask me anything (if you're still here obviously)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[关于国内手机厂商账号存在的隐私风险
目前，国内一些手机厂商的账号系统存在隐私安全方面的隐患。以下是我发现的具体问题，重点涉及 OPPO 和 vivo 两个品牌的账号系统。
1. OPPO 账号的隐私问题
当用户注册并注销 OPPO 账号后，尽管系统会对部分信息进行处理，但当前注册的资料（如手机号）仍然可能与账号相关联。
在某些情况下，虽然系统对敏感信息做了部分屏蔽处理，但通过其他手段，仍有可能获取到注销后账号的部分关键信息，带来隐私泄露的风险。

2. vivo 账号的严重隐私风险
如果用户忘记了 vivo 账号，只要掌握用户的身份信息，通过验证身份信息，vivo 系统会将用户的账号和手机号展示出来。
尽管 vivo 系统会对手机号的中间四位进行隐藏，但这些信息通过社会工程学手段非常容易被获取。
更严重的是，当重新输入 vivo 账号时，系统会直接显示用户的实名信息的前两个字母，这在某些实名制的场景下可能会带来安全隐患。

3. 与厂商沟通的反馈
针对此问题，我曾与 OPPO 客服沟通过，但目前该问题似乎仍然没有得到妥善的处理，风险依旧存在。
目前只发现 OPPO vivo 存在一定风险，不知道其他手机厂商是否存在，说实话为什么现在手机厂商不会倾听用户的建议]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[我在做一个视觉认知(神经科学)的实验，电脑屏幕会出现一个目标刺激，然后等待人类被试做出反应，这段时间称之为反应时，reaction time ，也就是被试准备作出反应的时间。
比如要求被试在屏幕上出现黑色方块时，就用手指敲击桌子。我该怎么确定其精确的反应时间呢（毫秒级别）？    
我的思路是，这个事情分做两步：
记录被试敲击桌面的时刻，通过一副对射型 omron E3Z-T61A 光电开关来做到这件事，它的响应时间可以 1ms 一下，被试敲击桌面时，遮挡了放在桌子上的光线，于是可以在示波器上记录到精确的时刻。
接下来的问题是怎么确定屏幕上出现目标刺激（例如一个黑色方块）的时机呢，据我所知，可以用光敏电阻，但是它的响应时间好像很慢。不知道有没有类似方法 1 的简单粗暴的措施？（高速相机就算了，不是各个实验室都有这个条件呀。） 
以上的问题也可以延伸为，如何使用外部设备客观测量屏幕的刷新率。]]></summary>

------下面是正文-------------------------------
路在脚下
三月份被裁之后，找工作不是很顺利。这让我有时间停下来思考接下来的路该怎么走，之前工作时候想法是先扩大自己的技术影响力，觉得自己技术也不错还能靠技术生存，同时在工作时候思考如何独立生存。经过这几个月从刷题、背八股文到投简历面试，证明无法继续靠打工来生存了，需要考虑其他路。
很早之前我以前的同事告诉我要学会独立生存，直到 2020 年末才真正开始考虑如何独立生存。第一步行动就是写博客，宣传自己。而现在开始下一步，实践摸索。
这段时间我在干什么
补数据结构和算法
3 月份被裁之后我没有立即去投简历找工作，而是把补上我的弱项--算法和数据结构。于是我把极客时间的《数据结构与算法之美》再刷了一遍，然后又把 leetcode 经典 150 题刷了一遍。
这两件事情花了我差不多 3 个月时间，有时在刷题过程中大脑思考过度（ cpu 过热）整夜失眠，而 leetcode 大部分题目都是脑筋急转弯。
我觉得了解某些算法的思想是有必要，尤其在高并发场景，而实际工作中算法很少让你实现，更多是需求的理解和抽象、沟通协调、工程化的能力。但作为过滤候选人手段，我是能理解。
准备八股文和项目经历
大概花了两个星期，准备 go 相关的八股文（切片、map 、chan 、context 、垃圾回收、GMP 、goroutine ），而项目经历只准备了两天。
投简历面试
5 月底开始找人进行内推，结果是大厂基本不招人或投了没有任何音讯。后面陆续有三个中厂面试，但结果都是一轮面试未通过，原因有个人面试发挥、也有跟面试官知识图谱重叠部分较少问题。
开源项目的源码研究

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[我的 nas 是 ds218+，装了 2 个 14T 硬盘
前段时间有个盘报有坏道，就买了一个 16T 矿盘，无损替换坏硬盘下来。
无损替换的方法大致是这样：
把各种服务停掉，把好 14T 硬盘换下，新 16T 硬盘换上，成为 新 16T + 坏 14T 的情况。
然后做 raid1 ，让系统自动把坏 14T 盘的内容复制到新 16T 上。
复制完成后，解除 raid1 ，把 2 个硬盘都取下来，好 14T 硬盘放原来的位置，新 16T 盘放坏 14T 的位置。
然后启动各个服务。
过了几天，LP 发现她的 photos 的相册没了。幸苦整理了几年的相册没了。
然后我看自己的相册，也没了。
然后我新建一个相册，可以创建成功。
又过了几天，发现我最近建的那个相册又没了。
相片都还在，只是相册没有了。
寻求群晖技术支持，跟意料的一样，没什么用。
我在硬盘上找了一会儿，没找到相册数据保存在什么位置。
有同学有类似的遭遇吗？或者有同学知道 photos 的相册数据放在哪个位置吗？我找找看能不能找回来。
还有，我不太确定丢相册是我换硬盘导致的，还是群晖升级系统导致的。因为它有时会自己升级。而那个相册，也不经常看，只是偶尔看看。所以相册是什么时候丢的并不是很确定，只是刚好在我换硬盘后过几天 LP 看相册才发现的。]]></summary>

9 月 26 日｜路透引述消息人士称，中国计划推出新的财政刺激措施，包括发行约两万亿元人民币特别国债，以应对通缩压力和经济增长放缓，实现年初制定的目标。
消息人士称，财政部拟发行一万亿特别国债，主要用于刺激消费，部分资金计划用于补贴消费品以旧换新、大型设备升级，部分资金将向两孩或两孩以上家庭提供每孩每月约 800 元补贴(不包括第一个孩子)。还计划透过单独发行特别国债再募集一万亿，帮助地方政府解决债务问题，缓解去杠杆压力。
此外，中国政府还计划加大对中小企的阶段性补贴，如税费减免、就业补贴等，以降低中小企的经济成本。
消息人士称，部分措施最早在本星期公布。]]></summary>

v 站一个运行在国外的站，感觉比国内备案的网站都厉害。大佬名字不让发这可以理解，但是这个词是一个正常的词就因为里面含有那个姓吗？]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[最近个人使用的 Windows 镜像存储池崩了，两块 4t ssd ，居然还卡 windows bug 重建失败了且无法继续重建，花了 600 多块买了数据恢复软件才给恢复了，让我反思如何安全且实时的备份数据。
1 、组 raid ，虽然 raid1 不是备份，但是想实时有个数据副本还是令人安心的，就是贵了些，过去折腾的多买的主机有些多，每台主机都搞 raid 也不太方便，尤其一些迷你主机只有一个 nvme ssd ，整两个 ssd 组 raid1 有些浪费了，数据都上传 nas 个人平时管理心智压力也大，尤其是我的数据到处乱放，结构变更也比较频繁，长久看自动化不太现实，组 homelab 也是为了方便不是给自己找麻烦。
2 、使用数据备份软件
SyncBackFree是文件级别的，因为平时是虚拟机重度用户，这些虚拟磁盘太大，文件级别备份每次读写压力还是太大了。
restic比较高级，但是看原理貌似是分块算哈希，文件时间比对，文件块貌似没有时间戳追踪，那么增量备份应该还是要扫描一遍整个文件吧，磁盘读的压力又大了，而且这些虚拟机都是运行状态，热备份下的情况又是个问题。
基于卷影复制的一些软件，比如Diskgenius可以全量和增量备份 热备份，测下来增量还是只能文件级别备份，对于大的虚拟磁盘变更情况还是存在问题，把软件跑在虚拟机里面一台台备份文件勉强能用但是管理成本大了时间久了估计又懒了不做了。
Macrium Reflect 没用过，貌似很强，不知道有没有实现文件块级增量备份
存在一些文件块级实时追踪更改的备份软件吗（或者某种民用的异步镜像技术？），每次只增量备份修改的文件块而不是文件，不知道 ZFS 或者 Btrfs 之类的支不支持块级增量备份到远程（要换操作系统了。。），实在不行只能加钱组更多 raid1 了，raid5 被大家黑怕了不敢用。]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[事情是这样的：老程序员一名，因为想回老家发展（孩子出生了，不想跑太远），在老家找了一份工作。其实当时犹豫了挺久的，主要原因有以下几个：
我觉得工作内容没有上一份好（上一份工作主要是 AIGC 相关的，目前这一份就是硬件相关的自动化测试。）
薪资月薪比上一份降低了 3K ，但是年终多了几个月。
主要是怕目前这份工作内容太坑，但是胜在可以 955 。
在犹豫期间还拒绝过，但是对方居然在 base 上加钱了（虽然不多，就几百上千）。当时还觉得对方还挺有诚意了，就接了目前的这份工作的 offer 。
几个月工作下来，虽然确实比上一份工作枯燥，就是写写自动化脚本啥的，也从来没有在这份工作上获得过成就感，组内的编程水平也明显感觉比较低。（可能就是老家跟一线城市确实有差距吧）但是胜在可以 955 ，每天准时下班，所以整体下来感觉还不错，以为就这样可以安定下来。但是戏剧般的事情就在这个时候发生了：我的+1 居然提了离职，然后我的手下也被炒了。我们整个组也就几个人，这样下来我负责的项目就剩下我一个在干了（原本是+1 ，我，我 1 个手下在干）。
然后我还没请陪产假，打算准备请的，但是碰上他们的离职期了，需要交接，现在都不知道能不能休了，因为我休了项目就停摆了。
除此之外，我感觉+2 定下来的目标不可能完成，且他不懂技术，且他的目标可以说是乱定的！！！我对这里也没有归属感，技术氛围也很那啥，连我自己都可以当技术领头羊那种。对我而言这份工作就是上下钟。现在回想起来，上一份工作还是很快乐的，很有成就感，但是买不起一线城市的房啊 T T
所以，我该跑路吗？重新找一份自己认为工作内容可以的？还是先苟着然后看看自己早下班发展点兴趣/副业？ 有点迷茫，大家支支招，谢谢～
P.S. 第一次发帖，不知道格式，也不知道是否表达得清楚，如果有什么疑问，大家问了我再补充哈，见谅。]]></summary>

Microsoft Office/365
 
Adobe suites
 
AutoCAD
 
 These sets of apps are just so important for many businesses, government institutions, organizations, and even just employees with laptops, that without them Linux isn't considered by many institutions.
 Libreoffice works, but my professor will not accept a document from Libre, only Microsoft Word
 I would've included Microsofts administrative apps like Active Directory, but I don't know how many of them are supported vs not supported on Linux. I only know that Active Directory is supported on Ubuntu somehow.
 What do you think is making companies hesitant to try Linux?

 I will basically map my right alt key to my right shift key, so that when I press right alt, it will do the same thing as pressing my shift without any extra key presses.
 I am using Ubuntu on i3 windows manager, but this process should be similar for any other linux distribution.
 NOTE: i3 is running on x11
 INSTALL XMODMAP
 First we install xmodmap. Can be done using ,
 sudo apt install x11-xserver-utils
 We also need to install
 sudo apt install x11-utils
 This installs xev and xmodmap
 First we run,
 xev
 This confirms whether the key issue is software related or hardware related, if there is any keybinding it is showing then it means that the problem is software related.
 If there…]]></summary>

        <updated>2024-09-25T20:52:19.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Background
 I've replaced my wife's working machine over four times in the last couple of months (for reasons not relevant to this already long post), and this time it's an HP EliteDesk running Zorin OS because the thing fails to activate a Windows license, and being a normie, she prefers Windows. I chose Zorin OS as it's the first distribution that comes to my mind (besides Pop!_OS) for people coming from Windows.
 The Moment
 I only configured general stuff (like Chrome, etc.) for her a couple of days ago, didn't get the time to give her a tour of the new setup with Zorin OS. Today, she told me over the phone that she had to install Visual Studio Code using a setup file she had lying around, but she managed to get it working, which is what shocked me. She still has no idea why I was impressed, but when she showed me around how she actually did it, I saw that it was literally a Windows setup EXE and it worked just as it does on Windows, without her realizing it usually doesn't work that way in Linux, at least natively.
 Look How Far We've Come!
 Newcomers to Linux may not realize how back in the day we had to set up Wine ourselves and yet things weren't as streamlined as it appears to be now. But still, this kind of "backward compatibility" in a Linux distribution, and that too out of the box such that a Windows user doesn't even face a hiccup clearly demonstrates how far we've come with Linux, even for a long-time Linux user like me. To say that I'm impressed would be an understatement! Meanwhile, I do not understand why Zorin OS receives all the hate, and to me, it hasn't received the love it deserves.
 PS: Sorry for the long post, but I had to get this out!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[出差开会，一周里前后要开 800km 。开私家车不给报路费，于是从公司领了辆 audi a4 avant quattro ，柴油 2.0 代步
我自己开的是奶爸经典 途安 L ，本来以为都一个体系下的车，audi 又是豪华向，应该很舒服，结果一路各种不爽。
最不爽的是没有 acc ！ 2024 年的新车，只有基本的定速巡航。定速还不放在方向盘上，是在灯光杆下面加个定速拨杆。高速上车流速度变来变去，根本没法用。
然后车道辅助也只给了车道偏离警告。这警告还时不时不认工地的临时标线。高速进修路路段，本来就路窄车密，这鬼玩意还时不时滴滴滴错误告警，干扰驾驶员注意力。不但没用，甚至是负作用。
实际这车开下来，仪表盘上多数告警都是甩锅信息。比如一点火，先滴一声说副驾气囊激活。这种乱七八糟的无效滴多了，真的是狼来了的感觉。直接让人对警告声脱敏。等狼真来了，车厂回头还得说你不注意信息。
而且我这一趟还真见到了狼：回程高速上，仪表盘又莫名滴滴滴。那时高速车不多，就低头读了一下信息，赫然显示请补一升机油......心里一万匹草泥马奔过。15000km 的新车就这样.....如果是租的车，可以不管它。公司的车让加机油你不加，车出问题回过头来指责我野蛮驾驶咋办。只好前方就近找个加油站进去，拿着车主手册，现查这车的机油油号，在加油站一柜子机油里一通找。好在我以前老车全套保养都我自己来，连刹车盘刹车油我都自己换，这点事情倒不是问题，但是停车，读手册，买油，加油，这番折腾下来半个小时就没了。
另外不爽的这车油门太不线性了，起步怎么踩都不走，等到稍微有点速度又猛地一下推背。堵车时真能吓你一跳。我后来全程 s 档，油门一踩就推背，反倒一致了。
相比之下，俺的途安 L 有智驾包，acc 加堵车自动排队跟车，车道保持居中。油门线性不窜车。更没有乱七八糟的无效警告信息，开起来舒服太多了。
一定要说哪里好的话，高速时速 180 到 200 这段驾驶质感比我的车好很多（防杠：我这高速不限速）途安 L 踩到 160 就觉得到极限不能再加了。
最后还有个神奇的现象：这 a4 的油门我踩时间长了居然脚背抽筋！可能是油门吊的比较高，又是半躺坐姿，脚尖必须一直翘着。回到途安 L 上，mpv 车高优势就体现出来了，坐姿是端坐式，油门在脚下，不用绷脚背。而且有 acc 加持，高速上可以几十公里不踩一下油门，脚就自然踏在地上，太舒服了。]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi,
I created httpdbg, a tool for Python developers to easily debug HTTP(S) client requests in Python programs.
I developed it because I needed a tool that could help me trace the HTTP requests sent by my tests back to the corresponding methods in our API client.
The goal of this tool is to simplify the debugging process, so I designed it to be as simple as possible. It requires no external dependencies, no setup, no superuser privileges, and no code modifications.
I'm sharing it with you today because I use it regularly, and it seems like others have found it useful too—so it might be helpful for you as well.
Hope you will like it.

 Navita is a Bash/Zsh utility for rapid directory traversal, employing fuzzy matching, history tracking, and path validation for efficient file system navigation.
 Ref: CodesOfRishi/navita: Navita is a Bash/Zsh utility for rapid directory traversal, employing fuzzy matching, history tracking, and path validation for efficient file system navigation. (github.com)
 Informational: I was initially inspired by Enhancd, which lead me to developing SmartCD. Taking some free time and reviewing SmartCD again after 2 years, I saw multiple opportunities of improving the code and at the same time large chunk of my own code was not making sense to me at first glance, realizing I may have overcomplicated it :)
 So I decided to implement everything from scratch.
 Highlights:
  
Search and navigate to the highest-ranked matching directory.
 Recursively search and navigate Sub-directories.
 Search and navigate Parent-directories.
 Search and navigate your recently visited directories.
 Regex based directory path exclusion.
 Case-insensitive Tab-completions.
 (Adjustable) Frecency directory ranking and Aging.
 Ad-hoc or permanent symbolic link directory traversal.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The other day, I found myself reflecting on how far we've come from the early days when the only way to interact with a computer was through the command line. Nowadays, we have desktop environments, colorful and visually appealing applications, web apps, and social media. While it's impressive, I can't help but feel like the internet and computing in general have lost a bit of that 'wild west' charm.
 There's something fascinating, even mysterious, about interacting purely through text. It feels raw, direct, and oddly stimulating in a way that's very different from today's user-friendly graphical interfaces.
 So, I had this idea (though I haven't had the time to implement it yet due to work 😅): What if I stripped away all the modern graphical interfaces and returned to a fully command-line experience? Imagine surfing the web, talking to people, and interacting with the OS—all text-based, like the early days.
 Has anyone else experienced this feeling? Do any of you have experience living in this old-school, text-only world? Would love to hear your thoughts.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[我工作需要用到内外网，然后内外网电脑是隔离的，平时如果要转移文件必须使用专门的加密安全 U 盘进行传输，比较麻烦。前段时间在 github 上看到 cimbar 这个项目 https://github.com/sz3/libcimbar ，大概意思是在纯离线情况下通过二维码来传输文件，我自己试用了一下，传输速度和效果不错，虽然我自己试了下只有十几 M 以下的文件可以比较顺利地编解码，但对于我办公用的大多就是 word 、图片和小型 PDF 来说够用了。
但问题是这个项目二维码编码给了一个本地网页，二维码解码只给了一个安卓 APP 。这样的话，我只能用这个工具从内网传文件到外网，因为外网我用手机可以安装这个解码 APP ，但无法从外网传内网。
看了下项目介绍和 issues ，作者在 23 年就提到说准备着手做一个电脑上能用的解码工具，但似乎一直没有进展。我现在想的是能不能曲线救国。
一是在内网上装安卓模拟器，再在安卓模拟器里装这个解码 APP ，但安卓模拟器好像会创建虚拟网卡，感觉内网桌管系统会报警，不知道有没有规避方法或纯离线的安卓模拟器。
二是项目主页上提到可以自己构建，但我对计算机编程基本没基础，看了半天似乎也很难实现。而且我看了下它构建的项目似乎不是调用摄像头而是直接调取图片，没看懂既然文件都没传过来怎么调取图片。
希望有大手子帮忙看下这个项目在我这种情况下能够怎么使用，我感觉这个项目非常适合我的工作，平时内外网传文件折腾 U 盘，输加密密码耗时耗力，这个通过摄像头就能传文件真太有创意了。]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[9月25日，暴雪娱乐旗下知名卡牌游戏《炉石传说》正式重启国服，游戏预约人数目前已突破500万人。开服当天，由于游戏服务器登录、游戏排队等问题，“炉石传说进不去”“炉石围城”等话题登上微博热搜。


大量玩家反应，通过暴雪战网登录《炉石传说》后，会有10至15分钟的等待登入时间，登陆时还出现了报错退出等问题，进入游戏后，会有10-20分钟内无法正常匹配玩家开玩。由于游戏服务器登录、游戏排队等问题，有新浪网友发微博称：“外面的人进不去，里面的人匹不到人，这就是炉石围城！”。同时，“炉石围城”“炉石传说进不去”等话题也登上微博热搜。


对此，炉石传说官方微博发文回应表示：“开服至今，《炉石传说》仍然存在许多影响您正常流畅游玩的问题。您可能会遇到排队与匹配时长异常、无法进入商城、游戏中掉线等问题。事实上，目前国服真的遇到了非常棘手且繁杂的问题。在过去的近40个小时中，暴雪的技术团队一直在对问题进行修复，国服团队也不断进行着技术配合与问题反馈。除了炉石开发团队与战网技术团队外，已经有更多团队加入到技术支援之中。截止公告成文时，问题正在逐步解决，但非常抱歉，技术团队仍无法给出预期完全修复的时间。”


以下是回应全文：



关于当前《炉石传说》相关游戏问题的公告


亲爱的炉石传说玩家们：


对不起。


开服至今，《炉石传说》仍然存在许多影响您正常流畅游玩的问题。您可能会遇到排队与匹配时长异常、无法进入商城、游戏中掉线等问题。


事实上，目前国服真的遇到了非常棘手且繁杂的问题。在过去的近40个小时中，暴雪的技术团队一直在对问题进行修复，国服团队也不断进行着技术配合与问题反馈。除了炉石开发团队与战网技术团队外，已经有更多团队加入到技术支援之中。截止公告成文时，问题正在逐步解决，但非常抱歉，技术团队仍无法给出预期完全修复的时间。


在本次国服重启的过程中，炉石开发团队在保证补偿发放的同时，尽可能减少了对系统进行修改并进行了相应的测试。但实际上线时，大量补偿发放仍然产生了一些问题。在国服缺席的版本中暗藏着许多只有玩家数达到国服量级时才会出现的BUG，这些BUG的集中爆发更加剧了当前的情况。当前不佳的游戏体验并非由于国服的服务器配置与硬件投入不够，排队也并非服务器容量限制导致。


为了表达我们的歉意，我们将为所有玩家送上【5包“胜地历险记”卡包+5包“威兹班的工坊”卡包】作为补偿。为了避免更多不稳定因素，我们将在服务器稳定后发放这些补偿。


同时，我们希望在此对一些误解做出解释，恳请您的理解。


1. 这是网易故意的，排队是假的，就是不想让玩家进入游戏


非常抱歉，游戏体验的不佳让您萌生了这样的误解。我们没有任何理由主动拒绝玩家进入游戏。事实上，因为游戏存在问题，我们取消了大量广告资源，压低了整体热度，避免更多玩家遭遇不佳的游戏体验。我们也看到玩家发布的带有技术论据的文章，这些文章描述的现象大多数是事实，但导致这些现象的原因是各种BUG而非人为。


您的任何反馈都很重要。我们已经将各种玩家言论原文翻译反馈暴雪，希望可以让技术团队更好地理解国服玩家焦急的心情，保证团队可以更积极地应对目前的情况。


2. App Store搜索不到《炉石传说》


由于在过去一年中游戏下架，在App Store中搜索“炉石传说”关键词的点击都被引入了其他应用，导致根据算法《炉石传说》在昨日不在搜索结果前排。目前随着正常点击的覆盖与相关优化的执行，您已经可以正常搜索到游戏了。


3. 主播可以正常进入


我们并未识别这些玩家，同时暴雪游戏也没有插队等特权功能。请您理性看待这些言论。


4. 某某模式没有人玩了，所以匹配时间过长。


请玩家们理解，目前匹配时间过长是由于BUG导致的，无法反应正常的游戏情况。


最后，我们对目前的糟糕体验再次致歉，期望在服务器稳定后再给我们一次机会与您在酒馆中愉快游戏。]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[From my own (limited) experiments, anything not involving games and hardware acceleration can work wonders in a Windows VM. It might be just what you need to stay.
 Sure it might take a bit to learn how to set one up (luckily gui tools like virtmanager exist) but you only really have to do it once.
 For instance:
  
I successfuly run a Windows VM at work for RDP-ing into a client's servers (and for that i need a palo alto vpn that only works on windows)
 
I have successfully used Logitech Onboard Memory Manager at home to modify the settings on my mouse (you have to redirect the mouse to the VM but you can really easily do it from the menu bar in virt manager from the Virtual Machine item)
 
I successfully screen shared with audio through discord in the VM
 
 Following the same logic I am willing to hazard a guess (havent tested these claims yet) that a good chunk of the adobe suite could work this way (the "chunk" being the parts that don't require hardware acceleration) - if you are experienced enough to tackle a gpu passthrough, then all the better. That is, if you absolutely need adobe and your workflow require features foss alternatives dont have.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[最近去另一个部门支撑了一段时间，可以自己选择留在新的部门或者回到原来的部门，纠结中，大佬们给点意见
原来的部门：
前端 vue + ts + three.js ，但大部分时间都是在画表单 UI ，three.js 基本就是简单地调 api ，加班时间在可接受范围内
已经在这个部门待了 2 年了，团队内的后端和测试都比较好沟通，基本没有写代码以外的琐事杂活
主管人挺好，主动给我涨过一次工资
业务比较简单，感觉技术上没什么长进了，都是画表单干重复的活，担心不利于职业发展
新的部门：
用 ts 写打包工具，感觉比原来干的前端画 UI 更有技术含量
业务非常复杂，开发难度大，接到需求或 bug 经常会有种无从下手的感觉
加班压力比较大，有好几次加班到 12 点修 bug ，在原来的部门从来没遇过超过 9 点下班的
写代码以外的事情比较多，经常要跟其他团队对接，各种拉通对齐
我双非本科毕业 3 年了，大部分时间都是在干前端，以后的求职方向应该也只能是前端了，不知道新部门的工具链开发是否能作为简历加分项，在纠结值不值得去新部门加班卷，想请前辈们给点意见]]></summary>

我是办公室电脑很垃圾，装了 win10 系统基本只能打打字，看个抖音都有点卡。家里放了台 macmini m1 ，想着通过远程控制家里的电脑来摸鱼或者干活。办公室的电脑通过 wireguard 回家。
1 、VNC 就不说了，卡的根本不能用。
2 、可能是因为这台 m1 上装了 surge 且开了增强模式做旁路网关的原因，parsec 局域网总是搜索不到 mac 电脑，有次不知道怎么鼓捣的，能搜索到这台 mac 电脑了，但 win 电脑怎么也连接不上 mac ，然后就放弃了。
3 、teamviewer 用着总感觉不是很顺当，流畅度清晰度都达不到满意，自从找到下面的软件后就也放弃了。
4 、又从网上找到了 remote desktop manager 这个软件，建立 ARD 会话，性能和分辨率质量都默认，没想到速度还不错，可以用，就是清晰度差了点，并且没有声音。如果把分辨率质量调到高，画面质量清晰的很，但是就会有明显的延迟甚至卡顿。所以现在是用默认分辨率用着，模糊一点总比卡着强。现在就想知道有没有更好更流畅的方法来实现这个远程控制，或者有没有什么优化 remote desktop manager 软件的方法能让清晰度高一点且不卡顿。
多谢大家！]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello Hacker News.
I’m Martin, a graduate student from Prague, and I’ve been working on Coros, a C++ library for task-based parallelism.
After spending some time with OpenMP and oneTBB, I wanted to try building a library using modern features from the C++ standard library. I’ve used coroutines for task encapsulation and C++23 expected for exception handling, while trying to maintain good performance.
Additionally, I’ve implemented monadic-like behavior to allow easy chaining of tasks, similar to the monadic operations in std::expected.
You can check out the project here: https://github.com/mtmucha/coros
While this library isn’t fully-fledged or production-ready, I’d really appreciate your feedback!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[AFAIK, people dislike Snap because it's not fully free and open-source. However, if I'm not mistaken, snapd, the software itself, is free and open-source, while the Snap Store is proprietary. Another reason is that Canonical pushes it onto Ubuntu, but as far as I'm concerned, since it's their product, why would it be wrong to promote it? So, aside from the points I've mentioned, what are the other reasons people dislike Snap? Feel free to correct me if I'm wrong.
 Disclaimer: I am not defending Snap or Canonical in any way; I am just genuinely curious.
 Edit: I know there are multiple sources stating reasons why it is bad. I am just trying to see if people still hold the same opinions as before or are simply echoing others' opinions rather than forming their own.

But before switching, I want your to know your views and experience with Wayland and AMD cards? Are they stable enough to focus on work instead of fixing errors with my dual monitor setup? Currently back to my most favourite distro Linux Mint with Cinnamon on x11. No problem at all. But somewhere deep down inside my heart, I want Wayland. Fedora KDE is also my choice. But before purchasing AMD, I want suggestions also .. Help me please. Is AMD card a good choice for Wayland?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There's posts that seem very welcoming and friendly to new users, and other posts who seem to be pretty (or very) condescending just for what OS/distro of a kernel someone else uses. I've both seen people say you shouldn't expect Linux to be good for gaming, as that's not what it's meant for, and others who claim that it's very good with it. There's so much mixed messaging, and with a crowd that seems very ready to jump at one another, that's not a comfort. All this infighting feels like the history of China circa 1300s-1600s.
 I just wanted my taskbar on the left again ;-;
 On the user side it's been a pretty decent experience so far. The most difficult thing is that some settings seem very obscure or nonexistent (like telling a Wacom tablet to limit input to one window) - then terminal becomes necessary and online solutions don't work, so on
 But, when everything works, I am very much enjoying myself with Mint (w/ KDE Plasma). It just feels good. Windows 11's limited customization hampered that feely good I get when using an OS becomes fun.

 I've been looking for more fun terminal commands (think `cowsay`, `figlet`, `sl`, etc.) recently, and I noticed that there was a critical lack of cats in the terminal. It's time for a change!
 I've released this on nixpkgs as the `meow` package, should I also include it in the Debian (or other?) repositories?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[已知 a 网段(172.18.180.1)下有一台服务器(172.18.180.5)开了 samba 服务,b 网段(192.168.1.1)下有一台主机通过两张网卡同时接入了 a,b 网段，分别拿到了 172.18.180.3 和 192.168.1.3 。
这个时候在 b 网关上设置了静态路由，所有在 b 网段下的设备访问 172.18.180.5 的 samba 流量全部转发给 192.168.1.3 ，由它进行二次转发。
同时 b 网关还开了 2.4g/5g wifi6,现在的问题是 b 网段下所有的有线连接设备都能正常挂载 smb,同时 b 网段下的一台台式机通过 usb 无线网卡连接 2.4g wifi(不支持 wifi6)也可以正常挂载。
但是！ b 网段下所有的手机平板都无法正常挂载该 smb,提示权限不足。通过 usb 共享网络给台式机(禁用掉其他网卡)也无法正常挂载，但是通过 tcping 172.18.180.5 445 和 tracert,ping 都是通的，一切正常。
手机平板包含各种不同品牌和是否支持 wifi6 的情况。]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Examples of the before and after states of the organized folder after running Connor, along with the corresponding tree structure of the folder displayed in the GUI version of the app (It is displayed in the CLI as well).
 Connor works locally on your computer. The process begins by reading filenames and their contents from the selected folder, the cosine similarity score (between -1 and 1) between each file's content is calculated to identify similar files based on a specified threshold. Files that are above the threshold are grouped as key-value pairs into a dictionary, where each key corresponds to a category or folder of similar files. Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) is then used to generate topic names for the contents in each category, resulting in the creation of corresponding folders names. These folders are appropriately named and the respective files are subsequently organized into them.
 The tool uses a pre-trained NLP model sentence-transformers/paraphrase-MiniLM-L6-v2 to understand the meaning of the data and calculate the cosine similarity.
 Links: Repo and PyPI
 End-user (you) can:
  
Organize files within a selected folder or manually uploaded files (uploading files is only supported for GUI).
 Organize text-based files (.docx, .txt, .pdf, etc.) using NLP based on their content.
  
Customization Options:
  
Similarity Threshold: Allows you to choose a similarity percentage threshold for grouping similar files.
 Reading Word Limit: You can set a limit on the number of words to read from the file content.
 Folder Name Word Limit: You can specify a maximum number of words allowed in the created folder names.
  
The GUI doesn't fail gracefully so it needs some updates that will come soon otherwise its perfectly functional but the CLI is completely finished and its efficiency will be improved as I work on it. I would appreciate if you guys have any feedback. Thanks so much for reading!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[背景
应用实例部署在多个机房，不同机房的应用实例使用同一个 DB ，但是受 xxx 风险规则，不同机房不能够使用同一个 Redis：

然而应用中有一个定时任务会按时扫描 DB 中的某个表的记录执行相应的动作 Action ，并将结果回写到这条记录中。
一个非常直觉的想法是，使用分布式锁实现某个记录只有一个应用实例在操作。但受限于上述规则而无法实现。
因此，想问下该怎么实现才能保证一个记录不会被多个实例同时操作呢？
思考
目前几个非常直觉的想法是：
1.应用在扫表后会得到一批记录，每次在执行动作 Action 之前，给这个记录加个行锁？理论上是可行的，但不知道这种加锁的方式是否合适以及代价/风险。
2.每次只让一个机房的应用实例扫表，这样子同机房就可以使用 Redis
3.给 DB 加个字段让每个机房只搞自己的，当某个机房发生故障的时候手动改配置，让另外一个健康机房可以扫故障机房的单子。
感觉方法都有点野蛮... 另外这需求其实用消息队列应该是比较优质的解法，但目前规模不大，都不太想用到 Q...]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey HN! We're Raymond Xu and Raffi Isanians, the team behind Modern Realty (https://modernrealty.io). Modern Realty is an AI-powered real estate buying experience that helps you purchase homes without relying on a traditional realtor. Demo: https://youtu.be/VhsWSVn5blA
Our mission at Modern Realty is to make home buying easier, faster, and far more enjoyable. We interpret real estate data, giving you an edge on other home buyers.
Since 2024, there has been a growing need for innovative solutions in real estate, especially with tools like Zillow making it easier than ever for buyers to find the right house at the right price. However, the process still requires an agent, even though buyers are doing most of the work themselves. Modern Realty changes this by offering an AI self-service solution.
Raymond and Raffi came face-to-face with this technology's potential while working on AI at Google and handling billion-dollar asset transactions as an attorney, respectively. The AI tools we've built guide users through every step of the home-buying process, from scheduling showings to making offers, all without the need for a traditional agent.
Before we expand further, this summer we've built our core AI real estate agent, which can handle everything from disclosure summaries to competitive market analyses. You can see our platform in action at https://modernrealty.io. We're particularly proud of our offer generation tool, which creates offers that are then reviewed by an attorney at no additional cost.
We're excited to be launching here on HN and would love to hear what you think! If you're in the market for a new home or just curious about the future of real estate, visit our website or schedule a call with us to get started.

        <id>https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41637550</id>
        <link href="https://www.usevelvet.com/"/>
        <updated>2024-09-24T15:25:52.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey HN! We’re Emma and Chris, founders of Velvet (https://www.usevelvet.com).
Velvet proxies OpenAI calls and stores the requests and responses in your PostgreSQL database. That way, you can analyze logs with SQL (instead of a clunky UI). You can also set headers to add caching and metadata (for analysis).
Backstory: We started by building some more general AI data tools (like a text-to-SQL editor). We were frustrated by the lack of basic LLM infrastructure, so ended up pivoting to focus on the tooling we wanted. So many existing apps, like Helicone, were hard to use as power users. We just wanted a database.
Scale: We’ve already warehoused 50m requests for customers, and have optimized the platform for scale and latency. We’ve built the proxy on Cloudflare Workers, and latency is nominal. We’ve built some “yak shaving” features that were really complex such as decomposing OpenAI Batch API requests so you can track each log individually. One of our early customers (https://usefind.ai/) makes millions of OpenAI requests per day, up to 1500 requests per second.
Vision: We’re trying to build development tools that have as little UI as possible, that can be controlled entirely with headers and code. We also want to blend cloud and on-prem for the best of both worlds — allowing for both automatic updates and complete data ownership.
Here are some things you can do with Velvet logs:
- Observe requests, responses, and latency
- Analyze costs by metadata, such as user ID
- Track batch progress and speed
- Evaluate model changes
- Export datasets for fine-tuning of gpt-4o-mini
(this video shows how to do each of those: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KaFkRi5ESi8)
--
To see how it works, try chatting with our demo app that you can use without logging in: https://www.usevelvet.com/sandbox
Setting up your own proxy is 2 lines of code and takes ~5 mins.
Try it out and let us know what you think!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[🐼🐳暂时没搞懂怎么加图片, 就先引用一下自己知乎上的图片🐱🐶
最近在 github 上创建了一个d2learn 社区, 于是就想着怎么也得搞个 Logo 吧, 于是结合社区背景设计了如下 Logo

这个 logo 初看, 可能看不出什么。但是如果给一个提示: 二进制。那么我相信很多有一些计算机背景的同学, 肯定就能猜到这个 logo 的设计思路了 —— 二进制 + ASCII 码。下面就来详细的介绍一下 D2Learn Logo 和其动画的创作过程
Logo 想法的诞生过程
由于 d2learn 是一个关于技术知识分享、学习、交流的开源社区。所以 logo 设计的时候希望体现一定的技术背景并且一定程度的能表达 d2learn, 这样就有了大体框架
用二进制做技术背景表达
把 d2learn 含义直接或间接的融入 Logo
从文字到图案 - 二进制和 ASCII 码

这样我们就能很容易把 d2learn 或其中的几个字母通过 ASCII 转成对应的二进制
d2learn
01100100 00110010 01101100 01100101 01100001 01110010 01101110

或许可以换个排序方式?
01100100 // d
00110010 // 2
01101100 // l
01100101 // e
01100001 // a
01110010 // r
01101110 // n

似乎有点"图案"的感觉了
起初也差点就想把 0 和 1 的颜色调一下就当做社区 logo 的, 但想了想是不是有点太直白了点?
同时也想到了 0 和 1 与颜色中黑与白似乎是对应的, 这样就可以把 0 用黑色表示, 1 用白色表示就能自然的形成一个图案了

这样看起来就感觉有点哪个意思了, 但还是单调了点。或许可以把白色换成天蓝色(青-CYAN)似乎更有…]]></summary>

目前我找到的相关信息如下：
将这些邮件作为学习资料，对 ChatGPT 进行微调。这个方案我还没去测试，但是我想可能遇到的困难是，需要把这些邮件做成数据集喂给 GPT 似乎不容易。另外，这庞大的数据让 ChatGPT 阅读可能比较费钱。
Claude 的 project 功能挺适合做这个工作的，但是最大的瓶颈是它允许上传的文件大小太小，完全不够用，我上传了三四封邮件就提示快满了。
英伟达有个叫 ChatRTX ，这个似乎可以用，但是我的 Mac 好像无法安装，公司的 windows 11 带不动。]]></summary>

After 9 years of running my own OpenStreetMap tile server infra for MapHub (https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=11389989), I've open-sourced it and launched OpenFreeMap.
You can either self-host or use our public instance. Everything is open-source, including the full production setup — there’s no 'open-core' model here. Check out the repo (https://github.com/hyperknot/openfreemap). The map data comes from OpenStreetMap.
I also provide weekly full planet downloads both in Btrfs and MBTiles formats.
I aim to cover the running costs of the public instance through donations.
Looking forwards for your feedback.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Nut Goals 是我参加国外 Hackthon 的一个作品，最主要的特点是以一个小松鼠的视角来管理你的资产。
作为一只松鼠，你将通过自己专属的坚果储藏来管理储蓄和欲望。你的「 Stash 」代表你的账户，每颗坚果都是一种货币。不同种类的坚果是独特的货币单位，每种类型都有其独特的价值。
当你想为某个目标存钱时，你将创建一个「 Jar 」 ——这是一个储蓄计划，你会通过「 Hoarding 」（每次存款）逐步存入坚果。
如果你心中有一个梦想，那就是「 Desire 」，你可以通过逐步储蓄将梦想变为现实。Nut Goals 帮助你轻松追踪资产、组织储蓄计划并设定目标。
希望这个 App 可以帮助你理智消费、鼓励你积极储蓄，并控制不必要的消费冲动。
因为比赛刚刚结束，App 目前只有英文，不过不用担心，中文本地化和更多功能会逐渐加入，敬请期待！

经过这几天的思考，准备将这个事情最小成本的行动起来。并且将过程通过 github 记录下来。
记录在 https://github.com/Liangdi/indie-dev-daily
会记录各种点点滴滴，包括收支什么的，就当整理过的流水账。
今天发帖的目的
初期阶段我需要接触一些潜在的独立软件合作者，和潜在用户进行交流。
V 站肯定是这类用户的集中地，所以想在 V 站招募一些可能的合作者，以及潜在用户。
如果你只想围观，做做云股东，运筹帷幄也是可以的。
主要交流可以在 github 上 Issue 或者 Discussions 。
如有必要可以开个绿色软件群
参与什么内容
参与需求讨论
获得开发反馈
参与最早版本的体验（贡献测试.....）
获得项目的最新资讯
可能的收益
获得『创始会员』勋章
获得一些软的 EA 权益（低价格或者免费）
开发者一起拓宽市场
不知道广大 V 友感不感兴趣，期待你的交流！]]></summary>

目的是：当右边表格选中几条数据，不是全部勾选的时候，左边的节点是 半勾选 的状态（不是打了勾的全勾状态）

但是呢左边的节点又不是可以展开的那种，设置在 halfChecked 数组内的又不可以。]]></summary>

起初，我用 git bundle 来备份仓库，但是空间消耗太快，我想尽可能节省空间。
后来发现，Gitea 有「镜像仓库」功能。
上游仓库尚在，本地仓库可以同步更新，上游仓库删除，本地仓库也不会随之消失，本地仓库占用的空间永远与上游仓库相近。
不过这项功能有个缺点，仓库作者可以通过强制推送来删除上游仓库的内容，甚至把仓库换成另一个仓库。若上游仓库换成了另一个仓库，本地仓库也会同步上游仓库更改，变成另一个仓库。
无意间发现了 git fetch。
执行 git fetch <repo> *:refs/remotes/0924，待命令执行完毕，refs/remotes/0924 下会完整显示上游仓库引用的一切，git checkout 命令也可调出远程仓库的文件。不知道这么做有没有缺点，请大家指点指点]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[我在写个功能:
1.调用第三方企业收费 API 转卖给个人,用户充值获得积分之后才能使用 API,自己先垫付钱.
2.第三方 API 调用失败不扣费.
3.我搞了多个队列来限流用户的请求,大概 20 多个.
4.数据库用的 MongoDB
这是精简版数据模型
数据表

id
userId // 用户 id
status // pending progress success fail
requestData // 用户的数据
resultData // 调用第三方 api 的结果

积分表

point 

先保存用户的 requestData 请求数据, status 默认为 pending, 然后把这条数据给到 queue 队列, 队列里来处理逻辑.
下面是我的逻辑:
// 在开始事务
startTransaction();

try{

// 1.拿着 userId 查积分表 不足就 throw
if(point < 0) throw error NotEnoughPointError

// 2.如果处理成功过, 又因为某些原因又加入到 queue 里了
if(status == success) throw error AlreadyInQueueError

// 3.状态改为 progress
await setProgress()

// 4.转换一下用户格式 不修改表里的数据
await transformRequestData()

// 5.调用第三方 API 失败会抛出 ThirdAPIRrror
const result = await thirdAPI()

// 6.扣用户的积分
await minusUserPoint()

// 7.状态改为 success
await setSuccess()

// 8.提交事务
commitTransaction()

// 9.从队列里返回数据
return result

}catch(error){

// 1.终止事务
abortTransaction()

// 2.设置成错误状态
await setFail()

} finally {

// 1.结束事务
endSession();

}

问题来了...
1.我 20 多个队列同时大量这种请求, 队列是 Redis, 我加上这个事务是不是能解决并发扣费问题, 会不会多个操作同时扣费.
2.如果从 try 里面的调用第三方 API 之后的 6.扣用户的积分 7.状态改为 success 8.提交事务 这三个操作内部 throw 出错了,我钱就白花了.
3.我这逻辑有没有其他问题啊,实在没写过扣费,谢谢大家了.]]></summary>

GitHub 虽好，但始终有一堵长城横亘在前面，时时刻刻提醒着你小心翼翼。

知识的沉淀，对于承受的载体没有什么是可以从一而终一成不变的，很多东西虽然分散，但也印证了不要把所有的鸡蛋放进一个篮子。逐渐的，我用上了飞书国际版的邮箱，我用上了语雀（小记/知识库）来记录我的一些碎片想法和文字，最终还是选择 GitHub 来记录这一切。
不得不说，GitHub 真是个码字的好地方。]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi HN!
I made a live presidential polling website with real-time electoral results. Votes can be changed at any time until the poll closes. Only visitors from the USA can participate. Congressional district is detected automatically.
The idea is to enable a coordinated voting process, where selections are non-binding and negotiable rather than blindly cast once. Kind of like a presidential caucus, but national and over the Internet.
The infra is Fastly & DigitalOcean. Backend is a Django service running on DO App Platform with Postgres. Fastly is used for edge logic, captcha, geo location, and pushing updates to the page (Fanout). In theory it should be able to handle millions of participants.
Note: since my previous post, I've added a way to close the poll after a time period. I realized that without some kind of time boxing it was unclear what the point is or how long to participate.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey HN, we recently fine-tuned the llama3.1 405B model on 8xAMD MI300x GPUs using JAX instead of PyTorch. JAX's advanced sharding APIs allowed us to achieve great performance. Check out our blog post to learn about the cool sharding tricks we used. We've also open-sourced the code: https://github.com/felafax/felafax
We're a small startup building AI infra for fine-tuning and serving LLMs on non-NVIDIA hardware (TPUs, AMD, Trainium).
Problem: Many companies are trying to get PyTorch working on AMD GPUs, but we believe this is a treacherous path. PyTorch is deeply intertwined with the NVIDIA ecosystem in a lot of ways (e.g., `torch.cuda` or scaled_dot_product_attention is an NVIDIA CUDA kernel exposed as a PyTorch function). So, to get PyTorch code running on non-NVIDIA hardware, there's a lot of "de-NVIDIAfying" that needs to be done.
Solution: We believe JAX is a better fit for non-NVIDIA hardware. In JAX, ML model code compiles to hardware-independent HLO graphs, which are then optimized by the XLA compiler before hardware-specific optimization. This clean separation allowed us to run the same LLaMA3 JAX code both on Google TPUs and AMD GPUs with no changes.
Our strategy as a company is to invest upfront in porting models to JAX, then leverage its framework and XLA kernels to extract maximum performance from non-NVIDIA backends. This is why we first ported Llama 3.1 from PyTorch to JAX, and now the same JAX model works great on TPUs and runs perfectly on AMD GPUs.
We'd love to hear your thoughts on our vision and repo!

生效日期：2024 年 9 月 29 日 0 时
影响范围：所有非 VIP 用户通过 WEB 端（网页端）及 PC 端（电脑端）的下载操作
具体规则：
1 、当单日累计下载量超过 1GB 时，非 VIP 用户可以选择按 [ 0.05 元/GB ，不足 0.5 元按 0.5 元收取] 付费或直接开通 VIP 会员以继续下载；
2 、音视频播放、文件在线预览以及通过 APP 端（手机端）进行的下载不受此限制；
3 、分享方已购买免登录流量包的资源不受此限制。
无付费意愿的重度网盘用户，可参加官方近期即将上线的每日签到、拉新奖励、转存奖励、算力共享等多种活动渠道兑换大文件下载券。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Among Gen Z, there's a problem of how a lot of people don't even know how to use a computer in the workplace because they just used their smartphones for everything. With this phenomenon in retrospect, I was wondering if Linux could be a better introduction to an advanced computer.
 Linux tends to be more secure against malware, can be made to resemble Windows superficially enough, and you can keep kids away from executing more dangerous commands with a sudo password. The compatibility issues with a lot of software can also be used against them trying to execute pirated games and the like, basically making it easier to control what they have access to.
 I know there are stories of how if you apply child protection time limits or website blocks they end up adapting and circumventing it...but if they do that with Linux, then they are also forced to learn how the system works well enough to familiarize themselves with programming knowledge which could help them in the future.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[https://www.manning.com/books/data-oriented-programming-in-j...
This book is a distillation of everything I’ve learned about what effective development looks like in Java (so far!). It's about how to organize programs around data "as plain data" and the surprisingly benefits that emerge when we do. Programs that are built around the data they manage tend to be simpler, smaller, and significantly easier understand.
Java has changed radically over the last several years. It has picked up all kinds of new language features which support data oriented programming (records, pattern matching, `with` expressions, sum and product types). However, this is not a book about tools. No amount of studying a screw-driver will teach you how to build a house. This book focuses on house building. We'll pick out a plot of land, lay a foundation, and build upon it house that can weather any storm.
DoP is based around a very simple idea, and one people have been rediscovering since the dawn of computing, "representation is the essence of programming." When we do a really good job of capturing the data in our domain, the rest of the system tends to fall into place in a way which can feel like it’s writing itself.
That's my elevator pitch! The book is currently in early access. I hope you check it out. I'd love to hear your feedback.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[我目前就读于一所双非一本大学今年刚刚大四，是复读一年考上的，第一年连二本都上不了，第二年高了一本线 19 分。当时很高兴，整个暑假都在憧憬着美好的大学生活，感觉自己将来会大有作为......
软件工程这个专业是我自己选的，因为那时我觉得我对计算机还算感兴趣，也有很多想法，喜欢捣鼓，上大学的第一台台式主机也是我自己买配件组装的。
但是回想到现在，我好像一直都在迷茫中，真的不确定自己喜欢什么、想要什么。
高中的时候就学过一点点 c 语言参加过算法竞赛，之前还因为玩 mc 开过服务器，学 java 还想开发插件 mod 啥的，买过域名、买过云服务器、搭过博客、还搞域名邮箱啥的，在服务器上跑 python 脚本刷校园跑...22 年周围人还不知道 ChatGPT 的时候我就已经深度体验过了。当时还想说开发一个代理网站，token 收费那种。也炒过币玩了合约(当时啥相关知识也没有，亏了钱)想过去了解这方面的知识......等等的这一切，我都只是表面折腾了下，后面就没有坚持下去了，在大学很多时间我是在玩游戏、睡懒觉、刷短视频、应付学校的作业。我觉得我是很有想法的，但是没有激情、没有执行力，或者叫间歇性努力。
目前在准备秋招，陆陆续续也面了几家了，都是因为八股或者业务不熟挂了。我是一开始就不打算考研的，大一开始就参加了 acm 但是后面没什么结果，只有一些小奖蓝桥杯国二啥的，之后也是一直在应付学校的课程，当时那会自己也不知道要走哪个方向，后面大三才慢慢确定要走 Java 后端，才开始学习，之后今年 5 月份在本地找了一个小实习，也没干啥就是 crud 。
对于就业这方面，我也是因为不想考研，加上 java 就业机会多才选择的。
现在每天都是躲在寝室，偶尔投投简历、看看八股文、刷刷算法题目，参加宣讲会、面试。
大部分时间都是在睡觉、刷手机、玩游戏。
晚上睡不着、很晚睡、早上起不来，醒来第一件事是点一份“国潮”外卖，坐在床上刷着抖音等着外卖......
感觉自己已经废掉了。
我也尝试过改变出去走走、骑骑自行车啥的，但是感觉也就那样。
我觉得我自己应该会喜欢旅游，但是我没有说走就走的勇气，因为我总是会在心里告诉自己，等什么时候有时间了、等毕业了、等找到工作了、等赚到钱了......所以直到现在我也没有自己真正出去旅游过。
在学校也没啥朋友，我本人倒不是非常内向，只是说没有那种真心的朋友，除非像室友一样天天在一起，我基本上很少和别人交流，也不会去主动找一些志趣相投的，而且我不太会聊天，和不太熟的人也不知道说什么。
说到室友，那会我还没上大学的时候，还在幻想，室友和我都是一群对计算机感兴趣的人，大家天天一起研究各自好玩的，甚至最终大家一起创业......结果还是我自己想多了，原来他们选择软件工程这个专业，只是因为听说赚钱，都对这方面不太感兴趣，从大一到现在，也没见过他们主动去研究过什么，更别说主动写代码。最后也都是打算干其他的。
感觉说太多了。如果你能看到这里，非常感谢你的时间。
我的家里经济情况也是比较普通，没有穷困潦倒，也没有大富大贵，上大学后，自己就一直感觉被束缚住了，就是想快点独立，不需要用家里的钱，所以现在也想快点找个工作，但是又想找个好点的，奈何自己实力不允许，找到现在也是 0offer 。
我不知道是不是自己上大学后太懒了，反正现在就是非常迷茫，做什么都坚持不下去，没有动力，也不知道接下来的路怎么走......]]></summary>

Our GitHub repo is at https://github.com/panoratech/Panora.
Building integrations by hand is tedious and time-consuming. You must adapt to API documentation quirks, manage request retries, OAuth/API key authorization, refresh tokens, rate limits, and data sync freshness. Moreover, you have to keep up with the constant rise of embedding models and chunking capabilities. On the other hand, with the rise of AI-powered apps, you have to handle …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[个人从 iPhone 15 PM 换到 iPhone 16 Pro ，目前非常满意，尤其是对 16 Pro 的续航非常赞，家里两台 iPhone 16 Pro 都明显感到续航大幅度提升，有种 3 年前使用 13 PM 的感觉，看了下实际电池使用时间，每天重度使用 11 小时才勉强用掉 100% 电池容量：

个人总结了三个原因：
1. iOS 17 太垃圾，导致 15 PM 续航严重不够用，充电时间明显多于之前的 13 PM
2. 上一台 iPhone 15 PM 用的是常熟新普电池，才冲了 300 次就衰减到了 89%，妥妥的劣质产品，新的 16 Pro 换回了惠州德赛。
3. iOS 18 新的调度策略也大幅优化了 CPU 电池消耗，整机用下来非常凉爽，很少出现 15 PM 上使用 5G 看视频 20 分钟就开始烫手的问题。
一方面靠软件，一方面靠硬件，这代很有可能成为 13 香之后又一个钉子户产品，至少在 AI 出来之前。]]></summary>

最近买了一台二手 Macbook M1 的电脑，在抹掉硬盘重装系统后是 sonoma 14.7 ，登录 AppleID 打开 iCloud 的「查找」功能，并且确认 AppleID 已经打开双重验证，以及磁盘启动是完整安全性的。
这几个条件都是已经满足苹果官网的激活锁条件的，但是在系统报告里的激活锁状态仍然是已停用。
按照前一个帖子里一些 v 友的回复可能是 MDM 监管机。
我 Google 了一些资料，通过 sudo profiles 命令查看是没有 MDM/DEP 的-- "Error fetching Device Enrollment configuration: Client is not DEP enabled."
在系统设置->隐私安全性的描述文件也没有监管的 profile ，在系统报告的控制器里的 MDM/DEP 操作也是否的。
而且目前可以抹掉所以内容和设置，甚至可以在启动选项的磁盘里直接抹掉硬盘重装，我觉得应该不是监管机。
所以想问一下用 MacBook M 系列 CPU 的朋友有没有类似情况？开启了「查找」功能但是激活锁状态是停用的。
这个问题应该怎么解决？谢谢。]]></summary>

目前对新卡的需求，最好是能放宿舍里搞个 wifi 路由，这样本地多机数据互通也比较方便，否则学校校园网的身份认证系统想搞内网联机还挺麻烦。
另外最好能接短信，最好能接电话。
目前来看符合这些要求的设备似乎就是买一台新手机，然后开热点。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[先说一下本人情况，双非本 985 硕，本科期间对编程非常感兴趣，同时也拿了很多国家级比赛的一等奖，最后也成功保研到某 985 学校。研究生期间花了大概两年时间琢磨科研，最后因为某些原因最终放弃了在学术道路上继续前进，收获了一篇二区论文和若干竞赛奖项。
我在本科和研究生期间一直有个大厂梦，也为此付出了极大的努力，最终在研究生期间如愿去了某不知名大厂实习了一段时间，实习期间最大的感受是，难道这就是我一直追寻的大厂吗？这段实习经历并不快乐，因为入职时正值组内动荡期，因此被领导和导师当做牛马使，很多时候得干到十点多才可以回家，周末也不愿意出去玩玩，只想宅在自己的小房间玩玩游戏，吃吃零食，看看动漫。
实习结束后，导师问我愿不愿意转正，我想了很久还是拒绝了。拒绝的原因有很多，首先是我自认为不够聪明，身边的同事不仅比我更聪明而且能在工作上付出比我多太多的时间。其次是工作的内容不太喜欢，每天的任务就是写一些比较基础的业务代码，我们组的前景我觉得也不太明朗。最后就是感觉互联网已经过了那个野蛮生长的时期，我想要取得像我领导那样的成就基本上是不太可能了。当然还有一点就是感觉实习的这段时间里，我已经完全没有同事之外的社交了，整个人也长胖了七八斤，如果继续在互联网行业，感觉自己很难找到一个能相守一生的另一半(我真的有点恋爱脑)。
因为十分恐惧秋招签的公司比实习时候还要离谱(当然还有个原因是懈怠了，实习结束在家休息了两个月)，于是觉得 all in 国企，希望能在国企里 wlb 。秋招期间投了数不清的国企与央企、最终选择了一个自认为还不错的企业，薪资水平基本上是在大厂转正后的 1/3 左右，不过基本上能保证 955 。
目前已经在公司里干了快一个半月了，因为某些原因基本上都干的是些办公室的活，等这段时间过去，可能需要转型成项目经理，偶尔会带着一些外包同事干活，主要负责协调和监督。还有个比较出乎意料之外…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[这个工具原本是我上个产品的补充功能，后来用的人越来越多，索性给它独立出来了。
开发背景
酷狗概念版和波点音乐一直都有组队领会员活动，达成组队可以领取若干天数的音乐会员。每月 2 期组队活动，可同时发起组队和加入组队，等于一个月可以领 4 次会员。但是活动限制每期组队成员不能与上期一致，导致用户需要到处拉人，这个工具就应运而生了。
主要功能
提供海量的队伍池，用户可随时加入正在进行中的组队
支持提交组队链接，根据用户点击动作判断有效使用率
用户规模
截至今天：酷狗概念版达成队伍 5300 个，约 15000 人；波点音乐达成队伍 940 个，约 3700 人。
关于推广
我的上个产品目标用户是网易云使用者，并积累了一些用户。但后来我发现压根不是这么回事，两边 APP 的用户画像几乎对不上，导致我几发炮弹全打棉花上了。接着我依据画像数据的大致走向，判断豆瓣的用户群体比较符合目标。我尝试联系一些大组的管理并得到一些支持，使用量渐渐上来但依然没达到我的预期。
没办法，要憋大了。
我在开发这个工具前，就建立过比较完善的私域链路（公众号-企微-社群），其中社群运营约 2W 人。接着我开始有针对性的策划类似“种草有奖”活动，并招募一些人在 xhs 进行笔记海投。由于我的人几乎都是素人博主，第一波并不理想；后来我加班做了些笔记模板作为参考案例，曝光转化逐渐攀升。至少目前不用我去拉队伍，主动提交队伍的用户量足够支撑工具的正常运转。
至此，我决定单独给这个工具拎出来取了个名字：饭团组队
后续
其实此工具还有一些可深挖的地方，比如：组队成功提醒、队长互组等；受当时思维的局限性未能考虑进来。加之我主要是做用户运营的，如果你看到我画的页面，就知道此人是个野生产品。站在我的角度，我更多的是考虑：如何短时间内利用需求去造势（当时有个平台组队活动做的很大）。因此该工具在进行代码生产的时候，我就提前筹备了公域-私域的链路转化工作，N 个运营策略，迭代再迭代。这也是开发老哥愿意不厌其烦的帮我搞定代码的原因之一。
最后放上这个小工具，移动端访问效果要好些：饭团组队
使用教程做了个海报，图太大就不贴了，可点此查看
若有使用问题可留言或联系：ZHJpbmt0ZWE3Ng==
最后，祝各位老哥的产品都能爆！]]></summary>

父亲大概十多年前从工地上摔伤过脊柱，目前身体还行。
母亲这个月确诊意义未明性克隆性造血，血癌患病风险相对大众要高出 10 倍。目前只是药物治疗。

注册极其繁琐，验证只能用手机号接收短信；
密码不能用明文检查，只能提交后看是否输错了；
接受完验证码才能提交，出了问题要一遍遍重新接收验证码；
只是简单的招聘（对我来说，海投的岗位之一），问了很多不相关的问题，包括但不限于：身高体重/照片/紧急联系人。这里说一下我的观察：我喜欢的一个公司会说明为了保证公平性，不希望附带照片；我去不去你企业都不知道呢，你要我紧急联系人干甚？
填表页面粗制滥造，包括但不限于：外国语种的下拉框出现技术代码 1/繁体中文等选项； textbox 无校验，身高可以输入“男”等
网页非 https ，安全性堪忧，感觉过两天我就可以在开盒频道里出道了。
本人普通毕业生，没见过这种阵仗。投个简历，一半时间在注册，一半时间在疯狂吐槽。请教下各位老哥：
是不是大环境就是这样？恶心的企业占绝大多数？
为什么每个企业都要让求职者把相同的信息填一遍表？这是不是一种服从性测试？
我该怎么调整心态/改变策略？能给我一点建议吗？]]></summary>

3. 安排 : 后天晚上，去她附近的一个商圈吃牛排（小城市实在没啥吃的，本来想铁锅炖，被朋友劝退了）。如果还有时间的话，去看个电影。

5.问题 :

     （ 2 ）有什么要积极表现的么？和要注意的问题。

Media Hoarder is celebrating its 2nd birthday today and it finally supports tv series with the freshly released v1.4.0.
Here's a video showcasing the new features: https://www.youtube.com/watch/3qfb5UWJrdQ
Development wise I've been joined by an individual named kolbdog323 providing lots of feedback and requests over multiple months which I'm truly grateful of, because Media Hoarder is still an absolute side-project developed by a father of two in his limited spare time :D
Please feel free to discuss features, development and sideproject-y things, I'm really curious!
Media Hoarder Website: https://media.hoarder.software
Blog post "2nd Birthday - TV Series Support": https://media.hoarder.software/blog/2nd-birthday-tv-series-s...

改 Socket 是没什么难度，但是被强制往自己的代码里糊屎非常难受。
Socket 他还没做任何权限认证，也就是本地的任何线程，不管是其他合法进程还是木马病毒，都可以给它的 Socket 端口发消息，只要格式正确它都会执行。

So, it's my third day back on Windows while I'm choosing my next distro and this is what I realized: modern Linux is drastically better than Windows in the user experience domain.
  
Even with flatpaks that are not designed to be fast and btrfs that is not built for speed either, apps load noticeably faster on Linux than on Windows. Tested on Firefox, LibreOffice, Gimp. Same SSD, different partitions.
 Incidentally, installing an app (LibreOffice again) on Linux does not require a reboot. I still can't believe that on Windows it does.
 Windows UI makes my eyes bleed and I can't do a thing about it without third party tools that are a can of worms in their own right. This especially applies to the taskbar.
 On Windows I can't switch the keyboard layout with one key like I do it on Linux. Since I do it hundreds of times every day, it's a problem.
  
I'll stop at this point to reiterate that no, we are not seeing things and not trying to convince ourselves of Linux advantages. It is actually better today, even in the area where Windows has historically been better.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[summer-trie
项目地址
github	https://github.com/chitucao/summer-trie.git
gitee 	  https://gitee.com/chitucao/summer-trie.git
介绍
​	这是一个节点支持任意数据类型的前缀树，适用于大量列表数据的索引和压缩，不同于有限字符集前缀树实现（每个节点表达的状态是同一类型），主要是设计思想是将数据中多个不同类型的字段作为节点，组合成一颗前缀树，提高这些字段的检索性能；
​	目前是用于同程旅行盲盒机票、火车票的本地资源预筛选、数据分析以及校验场景下的结果缓存；
​	如果使用的过程中发现有 bug ，或者希望添加额外的功能，欢迎提交 PR;
适用于以下场景
索引，大量列表数据场景下建立前缀树索引，提高检索性能；
数据压缩，支持将列表数据转换成树结构，配合字段值字典，既压缩了数据，也提高了查询性能；
关键功能和特性
比较通用和易用，只需要编写少量的代码，就可以将某个数据的多个字段组合成前缀树；
支持多种方式的增删改查；
查询条件支持 EQUAL 、BETWEEN 、GTE 、LTE 、IN 、NOT_IN （可以扩展），得益于树结构，等值查询复杂度可以支持到 O(1)，范围查询可以支持到 O(logn)，不仅仅是前缀匹配，也可以支持后续条件匹配；
支持简单的聚合查询（可以扩展），例如 MIN ，MAX ，时间复杂度可以达到 O(logn)；
树节点不存储实际字段值，而是由一个全局的字典维护字段值，树节点存储的是字段对应的字典索引，可以压缩数据，提高查询性能；
支持序列化和反序列化，适用于通信和数据 dump 分析;
几种核心的查询方式
按层查询，可以查询某一层的数据，典型的应用场景是从首层到底层依次查询情况；
原始数据查询，属于按层查询的特殊情况，查询的是叶子节点，并且叶子节点…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[小白用户，求大佬们点评下这个备份方案是否可行~
背景：4 盘位 NAS （ 464c ），没有做 RAID ，2 块 SSD ，2 块 HDD 。主要去备份照片，担心数据丢失。

方案：
1 ）定时（周粒度）把手机照片通过 QFile 同步到 NAS 的 SSD1 盘中。
2 ）定时（月粒度）通过 HBS3 做**同步**到 HDD1 盘中。定时还通过 HBS3 做**备份**到 HDD2 盘中。
3 ）定时（年粒度）通过 HBS3 做**同步**到移动硬盘中。
附：
1 ）不考虑 raid 的原因就是感觉 raid 也会出问题，还占用存储，不如直接做同步、备份来的划算
2 ）主要数据就是照片等，不考虑影片这类备份（同步）。
3 ）没有同步到网盘就是担心网盘的隐私等问题。
4 ）另外想"吐槽"下，感觉威联通的很多软件的功能都有交叠重复，都不知道用哪个比较好=_=
另外还要咨询下，iPhone 的 live photo 有没有比较好的从手机同步到 NAS 的方案，还支持从 NAS 下载会手机（依然是 live photo 的）]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It really is night and day, isn't it? My final straw with windows was hearing that they were getting rid of control panel (on top of the AI and recall shit). With how empty settings is, I just could not believe they would do something like that. It's complete horseshit with no purpose other than to make user experience worse. I have no idea why I was so attached to it or afraid to to switch over to linux. I think at the time, security was a worry for me (what will I do without windows defender?! oh dear!) but I can see now that's a total non-issue as long as you have a functioning brain and a firewall.
 It was a really difficult decision for me between Zorin and Mint, and Mint only won out last minute. Mint (cinnamon specifically) just does everything I want it to without any of the bloat. All my mainstay games are compatible with a little tweaking and effort. It's beautifully simple and customizable. I'm not being advertised to every five seconds. 
 This is a sign: if you're a newbie, and you're sick of microsoft but too nervous to make the switch, just do it. Go with mint. It works great, and there's a massive community there to help you just in case you hit a bump in the road. You'll be glad you did it.
 Edit: I'm sorry I exaggerated about how positive my experience was. I was having fun. I don't understand what I did wrong to get comments like the ones I have but I'm sorry. I wasn't trying to "jerk off" the community. I was just enthusiastic.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I made a post here two days ago where I painted Arch as an unstable distro. The issue was ultimately a bad SSD. Certain distros would crash less often, Windows would only crash at boot. But if you could get past the boot it would be fine. 
 I cheaped out and brought a budget SSD from Amazon. I owned up to my mistake and brought a 990 Samsung 4TB. Installed Windows first, then tried NixOS for about an hour. Realizing I was way over my head - it's definitely a neat OS I'll probably try as a server OS, I installed Open Suse Leap again. 
 I apologize to the Arch community here. I was warned by them it was probably a hardware issue about a month ago. However, I don't think I'm hardcore enough for a rolling distro as my daily driver. I might buy a Thinkpad when they're on sale and use that for experimenting with Arch or NixOS later on.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I just wanted to say how incredible this is. I just bought a small Lenovo Yoga 710 11isk laptop (touchscreen and tablet convertible), just as a backup laptop if my main Windows pc does something wrong. 
 I first tested Windows 11 battery life on my laptop. Lasted around 3 hours, with YouTube in the background. I install Ubuntu, and cpu-freq.
 Instantly, battery life is upped by 5-6ish hours. Incredible.
 I would be using Ubuntu as my main os id it wasn't for Adobe's greed of not wanting to port their stuff to Linux.
 (no, I can't use alternatives, I use programs like Premiere Pro for professional video editing)

直到几天前我升级了 iOS 18 ，从此英语键盘不再支持德语的滑动键入和词语联想。当我重新添加德语键盘时，发现除了添加为新键盘外，还多了一个可以将德语添加到英语键盘的选项。

添加后，原来的英语键盘变成了英德双语键盘，而且第一次使用时，还会有欢迎信息。感情是苹果贴心地将之前的隐式双语功能，变成了现在的显式双语设置。]]></summary>

You didn't need to redownload libraries that technically already exist in your system and on more updated distros like OpenSUSE and Arch, the packages were already updated anyway, so I just never got that into them. Of course, all of this also applies to Docker, Podman, and Distros like Bazzite and OpenSUSE Aeon, since I didn't really understand them for similar reasons.

到提车
截止目前已经开了 2000 多公里，说一下体验吧：
车机 360 真是新手福利，目前倒车还未有擦挂（希望说了后，后面不要有），现在开车大部分还是凭感觉了。
开车前在 B 站看了不少车祸视频，学到很多经验。
提车不到一个月，在高速(堵车路段)被追尾，修了 1.4w ，修车那段时间人都是麻的，陷入自我怀疑阶段。
提车前两个月通勤开车（练车），也是受不了下班高峰天府立交到人南立交那截路堵得要死，放弃了。
周周在小红书搜成都周边，跑了些地方，也跑了几次山，跑山真的爽啊！下次准备去都江堰那边跑一下山。
基本上一个月一箱油，也是这么给自己规定的，溜溜车，感觉像是买了一个宠物。
买完车后，心里最大的感受是了了一件事，我也有车了，心里是舒服的。我是家里几兄弟最后一个买车的人，但是我第一个买新车的哈哈哈哈。
通勤那段时间还是有点后悔没买混动或者纯电，因为在想车里休息的话，油车没电车合适。现在倒是无所谓了，看了小米 su7 、领克的混动和电车，觉得内饰好没质感，还是我 03 的内饰看着舒服。
买车初衷算是达到了，就是交友方面好像没啥用哈哈哈。目前新鲜感还没过，觉得开车挺好玩儿的。这两天迷上 911 了，好帅啊，还想着要多少存款才能搞一台。]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[性格比较宅，这段时间工作又比较忙，基本上都是两点一线，也就很少出去玩了。
这个周末终于空闲了一下，决定还是出去走走吧。在地图上随便看了看，决定去西山岛转转。一来它在苏州，距离上海并不远，开车两个小时就能到，二来看中它的与世隔绝，它是位于太湖中间的一个小岛，只有一条笔直的公路可以进岛。
忙了一大段时间后，如果突然停下来，就会变得很空虚了，有一大段时间但不知所措。这时候就会怀疑自己，得到一些悲观的情绪。
找地理上的与世隔绝，就是想暂时隐藏自己一下，自我暗示可以放松了，就像是一只鸵鸟，把头埋进沙子里。
晚上 7 点多开车出发，全程都是高速，发现越是靠近苏州市区，路上的灯也就越亮，路况也就越好。
下高速时，基本上就是进岛的路线了，有一条长长的笔直的公路，两边都是湖水，由于是深夜，所以两边都是黑漆漆的，但可以感觉到两边的宽阔，进岛公路也修的特别好，除了机动车道，还有栏杆围起来的非机动车道，还有一层是行人道。进到这条公路，一下子就变得特别的安静，大桥上三三两两的有人聚在一起，有的还摆好了烧烤架，有的则是架好了鱼竿，准备钓条大的。
住的地方是一处自建房，装修的特别西式，大片的白色墙壁，门口还有一个小型的游泳池。到达目的地时，老板还在别处忙，一个老大爷（目测是老板的父亲吧）牵着一条是老大爷的拉布拉多（ 13 岁），拉布拉多性格温顺，对客人热烈欢迎，他那个大嘴巴，大舌头舔的我的手一手的口水，还有点黏糊糊的，弄的主人还有点不好意思了:快去厨房洗个手。
早上 7 点起床了，决定先把今天的跑步任务完成，早上天气比较凉爽，马路上也没有什么车子，绕岛的周围小跑了 10 公里。周围就是太湖，一望无际，感觉就像是在海边跑步一样。我可能天生喜欢视野开阔的感觉，每天生活在城市里，钢筋水泥，摩天大楼组成的钢铁森林，很容易就从生理上觉得压抑和不适。在这种空旷的地方跑步，脚踩在土地上，跑完步，感觉手和脚都很暖和，心脏还在刚才的运动中一点一点的平缓，这时候很清晰的感觉到它的跳动，感觉自己确确实实的在活着。走累了，就站在湖边，对着湖打喊一声，在这里你可以肆意呐喊，内向人的福音，不会有人觉得你很奇怪。
离开民宿后，我们驱车前往缥缈峰，《天龙八部》里天山童姥居住的地方就在缥缈峰，不知道是不是取材于此。其实它就是一个小山，一条山道直接从山脚通到山顶。站在山顶，可以俯瞰整个岛的全貌，如果天气比较好，可以看到太湖更远的地方。只可惜，今天天气不好，只能看到近处的湖面，波光粼粼，一道道波纹里藏着金光。
接着是林屋洞，大热天的，山洞里很清凉，还有潺潺溪水。
大概到下午四点多，眼看着岛的上空布满了一层厚厚的乌云，应该就是要下大雨了，就准备驱车离岛了。]]></summary>

        <id>https://www.v2ex.com/t/1074873#reply2</id>
        <link href="https://www.v2ex.com/t/1074873#reply2"/>
        <updated>2024-09-22T14:20:38.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[问题描述
前情提要：/t/864749
简而言之，就是在 macOS 的 Apple Books 中，如果一个段落 (paragraph) 在结束之前遇到了分页 (page break)，那么这一个段落在分页之后的那部分是不会响应 Force Click 取词的。到了下一个段落就好了。示意图：

这里绿色区域就是可以正常取词的区域，红色区域就是 Force Click 没反应的区域。可以看到，红色 区域并不是一个完整的 paragraph ，而是一个 paragraph 被分页截断之后的部分。
不知道这样描述是否清楚。
Notes:
Force Click with One Finger 取词 (Look up & data detectors) 这个是系统默认设置，在 macOS System Settings - Trackpad 中可以看到。
在上述 bug 区域，手动选中单词、在右键菜单中点击 Look up 则没问题。
排查过程令人抓狂
(1) 更新系统/更换电脑：我在 2022 年 macOS 12.4 观察到这个 bug ，那时候我还在用 Intel 芯片的 MacBook 。到现在 2024 年，我都换过 M 芯片的电脑了，系统更新到 macOS 15.0 这个 bug 依然存在，在我的电脑上 100% 复现。
换电脑的时候我并不是使用 Time Machine 直接迁移配置的，而是在新电脑上从 0 开始，登录 Apple ID 、下载各种软件、逐步 copy 旧文件过来，所以 “旧电脑的配置污染新电脑” 的概率不是很大。
(2) 创建新用户，不登录 Apple ID：另外，为了排除 Apple ID 的影响，我今天特意创建了一个全新的用户 (user)，登录进去之后尽可能不做多余操作，什么额外软件也没装，也没有登录任何 Apple ID ，就连上 Wi-Fi 开启 AirDrop 然后从手机传了一个 .epub 文件过来用 Apple Books 打开，结果上述取词 bug 被复现。
俗话说“重启解决 90% 的问题，重装解决 99% 的问题，重买解决 100% 的问题”。现在重买都解决不了我的问题了。那么有一种可能就是，这就是确实存在的 bug ，不是个例。但如果是这种情况，应该有很多人遇到才对，但我之前问网友，网友的反馈就是“我这里没问题”……
真的不知道怎么排查好了。你们真的没有遇到这个问题吗？]]></summary>

    let mut ts2=TcpStream::connect(("127.0.0.1", 6667)).unwrap();
    //这里不得不进行 clone
    let mut ts11=ts1.try_clone().unwrap();
    let mut ts22=ts2.try_clone().unwrap();
    thread::spawn(move||{
       std::io::copy(&mut ts1,&mut ts2).unwrap();
    });

    thread::spawn(move||{
        std::io::copy(&mut ts22,&mut ts11).unwrap();
    });
    // 以下两种情况以开发一个 http server 为场景
    //2 当需要将 TcpStream 使用 BufReader  和  BufWriter 封装构造一个结构体给上层使用
    
    struct Req{
        br:BufReader<TcpStream>,
        bw:BufWriter<TcpStream>,
    }
    //3 如果不进行 buf 封装，底层处理也不能使用 buf 进行读取，因为 buf 读取可能会读取超过底层处理的数据的长度，这样底层
    // 只能使用非 buf 方式进行读取，效率就比较低下
    struct Req1{
        ts:TcpStream
    }
    
    
}


目前我能想到的 TcpStream 读写一体，是为了 drop 时候自动关闭 tcp 连接，但是这样确实带来了诸多不便。 同样 BufReader 、BufWriter 在 new 的时候传&TcpStream ，不能生成一个具有所有权的 br 、bw ，会依赖&TcpStream 。TcpStream 为什么不提供一个 getWriter 和 getReader 两个分离的函数呢？]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[APPLORE - 探索 App 图标设计的宝库
大家好,我是一名设计师，现在算半个独立开发者。最近我花了一周的时间,开发了一个叫 APPLORE 的网站,专门用于探索和分析 App 图标设计。给大家介绍一下这个项目: APPLORE

项目背景
作为一个搞了 8 年的设计师,我一直对 App 图标 LOGO 的设计很感兴趣。每次浏览 App Store ,有很多好看的图标，但是也有很多辣眼睛的图标。如果有一个专门收集展示和分析好看的 App 图标的平台就好了。于是, APPLORE 的想法应运而生。
开发过程
整个开发过程大约花了一周时间。用 Next.js 作为主要框架, 借助 Cursor AI 的帮助快速编写代码。我不是专业的开发，所以我是完全借助 Cursor AI 帮我开发的这个项目
主要功能
APPLORE 的核心功能包括:
按类别、颜色或发布日期浏览 App 图标
查看每个 App 的详细信息
分析 App 图标的配色方案
创建和管理自定义图标收藏
强大的搜索功能
提交新的 App 图标到数据库

技术亮点
在开发过程中,我特别关注了以下几个技术点:
使用 R2 存储来高效管理大量图标文件
实现了流畅的无限滚动加载
采用响应式设计,确保在各种设备上的良好体验
优化了图标加载速度,提供流畅的浏览体验
未来计划
APPLORE 目前还处于初期阶段,我计划在未来添加更多功能,如:
图标设计趋势分析
图标风格筛选查看
结语
开发 APPLORE 对于一直做设计的人来说非常有趣。我希望这个工具能为设计师、开发者以及 App 爱好者们提供价值。欢迎大家访问 APPLORE 体验,也期待听到你们的反馈和建议!

前情提要
《低成本家庭万兆内网搭建指北》
《个人家庭网络布局分享》
《家庭内网服务分享》
《局域网内优雅的访问家庭内网服务》 
起源
前面的文章中讲到了如何搭建内网服务，以及如何通过内网 DNS 重写并结合子域名以及个人服务导航页来优雅的访问局域网内搭建的各种服务。
很多小伙伴还是对在外远程访问家庭内网服务有很大需求的，下面就来讲解一下，我个人认为的比较不错的方式。
安全原则
远程访问家庭内网服务的原则只有一个，那就是安全性。
五星上将麦克阿瑟曾经说过：不要为了方便而将内网服务直接暴露在公网上，那相当于在裸奔。
选择的原因
所有第三方的远程访问服务个人都不推荐。主要从速度、安全性、便捷性三个方面考虑如下：
速度方面：cloudflare 、tailscale 、zerotier 、frp 、蒲公英等所有需要第三方服务器中转的，速度都不太行。
安全性方面：数据经过了第三方服务安全性无法得到保障。
便捷性方面：最好能和在家里访问家里的局域网服务一样。或者能够一键连接访问家里的网络。
我自己亲自实践过 cloudflare 、tailscale 、frp 等等很多的方案。最后觉得最理想的方案还是：公网 IP + DDNS + Wireguard 。
这个方案是如何保证上述三点的呢？
速度方面。公网 IP 属于直连，比所有第三方服务都要快。能够完美的跑满家里的上传带宽。
安全性方面。不经过任何的第三方服务，且 wireguard 是开源软件，安全性有保障。
便捷性方面。可以将 wireguard 理解为一个 VPN 服务。一键即可连回家庭网络。和在家里访问家里局域网一样没有任何区别，不用改变自己的使用习惯。
此外，上面的方案还带来了一个额外的优势，如果家里部署了科学上网服务，可以在外无缝使用家里的科学上网服务。
实现步骤

I'm Andrei, and together with my co-founder Roman have been working on a tool called Reviewradar. Working with startups, doing interviews and sifting through endless software reviews are daunting tasks. So, we built a chatbot that lets you chat with over 3 million reviews from more than 100K SaaS products.
With Reviewradar, you can ask questions like:
- create a comprehensive SWOT analysis for both Notion and Obsidian
- give me negative feedback and complaints you have about Postmark
- summarise the reviews you have on products in the OCR category
I would love to get your feedback on it. Check it out here: https://reviewradar.ai
Looking forward to your thoughts / suggestions,
Andrei and Roman

特点: 上传文件之前本地加密,每个文件都是随机的密钥
上传完成之后,密钥会被添加到文件的分享码中,
分享码中包含了文件的大小，名称 地址 密钥等信息,
服务器不知道您上传的文件的内容,就连文件大小都无法得知
每个文件都是被分成 1mb 的切片后上传的
无需注册登录即可使用,加密的视频支持在线播放
不过由于文件列表是本地维护的,卸载软件后文件列表信息将会丢失
没有账号系统,而且因为是本地维护的，数据过多会导致卡顿,所以限制最多 10000 个文件
支持批量上传,批量导出导入文件

Not only does it convert PDF to markdown, but it also describes the images within the PDF using captions like `[Image: This picture shows 4 people waving]`.
In testing with NASA's Apollo 17 flight documents, it successfully converted complex, multi-oriented pages into well-structured Markdown.
The project is open-source and available on GitHub. Feedback is welcome.

 Only downside being not able to use touchscreen & no convertible detection.

 I used Nexa SDK (https://github.com/NexaAI/nexa-sdk) for running the model locally on different systems.
 I wanted a file management tool that actually understands what my files are about. Previous projects like LlamaFS (https://github.com/iyaja/llama-fs) aren't 100% local and require an AI API. So, I created a Python script that leverages AI to organize local files, running entirely on your device for complete privacy. It uses Google Gemma2 2B and llava-v1.6-vicuna-7b models for processing.
 Note: You won't need any API key and internet connection to run this project, it runs models entirely on your device.
 What it does: 
  
Scans a specified input directory for files
 Understands the content of your files (text, images, and more) to generate relevant descriptions, folder names, and filenames
 Organizes the files into a new directory structure based on the generated metadata
  
Supported file types:
  
Images: .png, .jpg, .jpeg, .gif, .bmp
 Text Files: .txt, .docx
 PDFs: .pdf
  
Supported systems: Linux, macOS, Windows
 It's fully open source!
 For demo & installation guides, here is the project link again: (https://github.com/QiuYannnn/Local-File-Organizer)
 What do you think about this project? Is there anything you would like to see in the future version?
 Thank you!

想到的方案：把手机图片一次性拷贝到 mac 上，用带有辅助查找相似图片的工具进行标记清理，在把这些标记过的图片用脚本在 nas 再清理一遍
请教：mac 能否直接读取手机本地文件？不是用 photo 那种，如果不行，可以通过哪些方式先复杂到电脑删除完后，再复制回去手机？或者有更高效的处理方案哈]]></summary>

但事实是，当你在横屏/竖屏对 APP 图标进行拖动/摆放/编辑之后，竖屏/横屏的 APP 图标顺序竟然不会跟着变，导致横屏和竖屏的 APP 排序是混乱的，这意味着当你对横屏摆放了自认完美的 APP 顺序后，竖屏还要来一遍！！！这让我这个强迫症相当痛苦，苹果也从来不修这个 bug😤]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[不会页面设计，可以用 flux 生成 ui 图，我是这么个流程，以条码生成为例：
先用 GPT 聊一下成熟商用的条码生成软件有哪些功能
再用 GPT 给出生成 ui 图的 Flux 提示词，中英文对照，方便调整
输入英文提示词到 Flux ，多抽几次（几乎每一张都很满意）
照着图再用 Claude 改一改（也可以直接用 cursor 按图片生成基础布局，不过我试了效果不太好）

可以看下我改完的效果： https://barcode-maker.com/zh
附 Flux 提示词：
Design a professional user interface for a barcode generator tool website with the following elements:
Top Navigation Bar:
Display the website name "Barcode Generator"
Include user account icon and settings button
Left Sidebar:
Provide a list of different barcode types (e.g., EAN-13, QR Code, Code 128)
Clearly identify each type with icons and text
Main Editing Area:
Large preview window showing the generated barcode in real-time
Editing panel with input fields and basic configuration options
Bottom Toolbar:
Include various editing tools such as add text, resize, change color, etc.
Use intuitive icons to represent each tool
Action Buttons:
Place "Save Project" and "Export Barcode" buttons in the top right corner
Highlight these buttons with prominent colors
Overall Design Style:
Use deep blue as the primary color with a white background for a professional look
Adopt a flat design to ensure the interface is clean and readable
Add appropriate shadows and spacing to enhance visual hierarchy
Ensure responsive design to adapt to different screen sizes
Make sure the overall layout is intuitive and user-friendly, allowing users to quickly get started with the tool.]]></summary>

我不是很确定这到底是防呆设计还是一个故障，所以在 Tesla APP 上找了人工客服，他建议我预约售后，并说没有接到过其他客户有类似反馈。我预约售后之后，接到一个 Tesla 服务电话，这名工作人员跟我说这是新三的正常现象，是特意设计的，然后我问他是否有官方文字说明这个操作，他说没得，因为只有新三才有这个操作。（在试驾和提车遇到的销售和交付人员都感觉不是很专业，有些配置，功能都跟我讲错了，所以导致我对这些人的专业性有些怀疑，而且这名售后给我的理由也不是很站得住脚的感觉）
想问问新三车主，是否有遇到过跟我类似的状况？]]></summary>

设备：红米 K40S （高通 870 ）
个人想更改 8 个核心中 cpu7 的频率设置，让其永远跑在特定频率（定频，如 2553600 ），但是并未成功
个人参考https://blog.51cto.com/u_16099177/8841374的步骤，进行了如下操作：
解锁获取 root 权限
尝试通过修改scaling_governor,从原本的 schedutil 变为 userspace ，来改变频率调度器，使得可以自定义频率
调整scaling_max_freq和scaling_min_freq的值为 2553600
但是通过以上操作定频失败，对scaling_max_freq和scaling_min_freq进行手动更改后马上就有不知道什么系统调度进程对这两个文件进行了修改，又自动调整回 2745600 了
查阅资料看可能是高通芯片 mpdecision 进程的问题，要终止才能定频，但是经查找手机上并没有这一进程。
上述操作在我的 pixel 5 上也进行了实验，依旧无法成功
求问大家有什么解决方案吗]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[刚刚搞了一套 All in boom 的硬件（ i5-12400 + 32G ），不知道如下的操作得不得行：
前置条件：
外部网络通过 DHCP 服务提供，不关心这一个外部网络接口以外的任何网络结构
AIB 有 4 个网口
有一个已经刷了 Openwrt 但是性能特别差的路由器（可以用来当无线 AP ）
有一台电脑有有线上网需求
我想：
PVE 通过一个固定网口当紧急情况下（比如说内部 VM 全部挂掉）的管理口
PVE 内部跑一个 Openwrt 当主路由，直通三个网口给 Openwrt 。（一个口链接外部网络，一个口给 AP ，一个口链接电脑）
PVE 内部跑一个 TrueNAS 当 NAS 系统，直通所有 SATA 口到 TrueNAS 上。
TrueNAS 通过某种方式加入 Openwrt 主路由的局域网，和其他设备实现互相访问（比如说 AIB 出来的一个网口上的设备能够直接链接 TrueNAS ，而不用 NAT 或者什么转发）。
局域网内的设备可以通过 Openwrt 访问到 PVE 的管理口，但是不影响 PVE 提供的那个网口的功能。（比如说在 Openwrt 这个 VM 没炸的时候局域网里其他设备可以用某个 IP 访问 PVE 管理口提供的服务，但是如果 Openwrt 这个 VM 炸了把网线连接到管理口上也是可以正常使用的（比如说手动设置网段之类的））
求助：
我想的东西是否可以实现，如果可以，这套方案的性能会很差吗？主要是 TrueNAS 和 Openwrt 之间如何互相访问，虚拟一个网卡？虚拟出来的网卡如果走 VirtIO 会不会导致吃一点 CPU ？（比较关心 CPU 占用是因为我不想让 AIB 太热，不然太吵）
如果可以实现，能提供一点技术上的提示或者指南，里面有一些我还是不太清除的，特别是有关网络设定这部分。我对 KVM 很熟悉。]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[坐标成都，Java 全栈，在公司兢兢业业干了四年，前后端运维全淦，还拿过最佳员工。奈何公司越来越牲口，领导内斗，回不了款，让改合同薪资，从固定薪资变成底薪+绩效。我不同意拒签字，然后从今年 4 月开始工资折一半发，15 到手直接变 6 ，挺到现在我人都挺麻了。 
找了律师，被迫离职+仲裁一条龙，证据准备四十页。而立之年来这么一出，真的心累啊我 C 。
现在搁家里学 go ，感觉除了生态没 java 好，哪哪都好啊，脱产猛学一个月再撸个项目，看看能不能找个税后 18 的工作吧。。我觉得目前成都这就业环境，一言难尽，不想再 Java 里混了...或者大佬们有没有啥建议? 
这波仲裁赢的概率能有 90%，除非我在庭上脑子瓦特说错话。律师还准备了话术，我提前好好背应该问题不大。
等成了，再分享下仲裁经验，证据列表和准备、仲裁流程和坑这些。

ps 现在无敌羡慕年初被裁拿礼包的同事，现在公司人心都散了，每个人心里都是想的啥时候给礼包，但偏偏公司就在这耗，太太太恶心了...]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[参考资料：
官方配置文档和示例
https://wiki.metacubex.one/example/conf/
mihomo (Clash Meta) 懒人配置
https://gist.github.com/liuran001/5ca84f7def53c70b554d3f765ff86a33
先贴我的的 dns 配置
dns:
  enable: true
  listen: 0.0.0.0:7874
  ipv6: false
  enhanced-mode: redir-host
  respect-rules: true
  # 附加参数 #RULES 为遵守路由规则进行连接，等同于 respect-rules
  nameserver:
  # 指定使用 dns 路由规则进行连接
  # nameserver-policy 未匹配的域名将使用以下 dns 解析
    - tls://8.8.8.8#dns
    - tls://1.1.1.1#dns
  proxy-server-nameserver:
    - https://120.53.53.53/dns-query
    - https://223.5.5.5/dns-query
  nameserver-policy:
    # 白名单分组使用运营商 dns 解析
    "geosite:private,onedrive,microsoft@cn,apple,apple-cn,category-games@cn,cn":
      - 运营商 dns
    # 自定义白名单分组同样使用 运营商 dns 解析
    "rule-set:custom-direct":
      - 运营商 dns

解释一下我的场景，路由器上使用 mihomo 插件，白名单模式，未开启 ipv6 ，使用 geosite 规则，路由规则如下：
rules:
  - GEOIP,lan,DIRECT,no-resolve
  - GEOSITE,private,DIRECT
  # 高优先级标注需要代理的规则防止被后面的直连规则影响
  - GEOSITE,google,其他
  - GEOSITE,google-cn,其他
  - RULE-SET,openai,OpenAI
  # 以下为直连
  - GEOSITE,onedrive,DIRECT
  - GEOSITE,microsoft@cn,DIRECT
  - GEOSITE,apple,DIRECT
  - GEOSITE,apple-cn,DIRECT
  - GEOSITE,steam@cn,DIRECT
  - GEOSITE,category-games@cn,DIRECT
  - GEOSITE,cn,DIRECT
  - GEOIP,CN,DIRECT
  - RULE-SET,custom-direct,DIRECT
  # 剩余全代理
  - MATCH,其他

配置思路如下：
将我认为直连能获得更佳体验的分组打上 DIRECT 规则并且使用运营商 dns 进行解析，获得国内 CDN 加成，比如 apple, ms, dji, steam 等。
未使用 fallback 配置，避免直连解析耗时较长。
使用 rule-providers 自定义直连规则降低 nameserver-policy 配置复杂度。]]></summary>

大概结果是：回撤最大 n%左右 n 是止损，盈利从几倍到几十倍于 n ，取决于时间和对应趋势的强度，平均一年单个品种机会大概只有个位数次数
其实本质就是低买高卖，趋势打破买趋势不断不卖，没有什么复杂的，难的是人这个变量，所以让机器去帮你做就好了
要说缺点，1 是品种要求，已经说过。2 是周期比较长，小周期看了下效果比较一般]]></summary>

部署原则  
个人认为家庭内网服务应该尽量遵守以下 2 个原则：
开源
Docker 化部署
开源意味着所有人都能查看其源代码，至少在一定程度上能够尽可能的避免安全相关的问题。同时开源往往也意味着免费使用。
Docker 化部署屏蔽了硬件、环境以及其它依赖相关的各种问题，不用和特定的平台相互绑定，使得服务的后续迁移也非常便捷。
Sun-Panel  
Sun-Panel 是一个漂亮的服务器、NAS 导航面板、Homepage 、浏览器首页。
Github: https://github.com/hslr-s/sun-panel

部署效果如下：

类似比较出名的个人导航页还有 Heimdall 。( https://github.com/linuxserver/Heimdall) 
Sun-Panel 支持局域网和互联网 2 种模式，UI 更加简洁美观，个人更加倾向于使用 Sun-Panel 。
虚拟化平台 
All in one 的玩家对虚拟化平台应该都非常熟悉。现在主流的虚拟化平台有 VMware ESXi 、PVE 、Unraid 、Hyper-V 等等。
个人使用过一段时间的 ESXi ，体验还是非常不错的。

于是就写了个软件，可以直接把多个 epub 合并成一个文件，看着方便许多，现在开源给大家。
目前只做了 windows 版本，mac 和 linux 版本懒得做，看大家有没有这个需求吧。
截图：

文件数量没有限制，多少都可以合并。
github 国内访问不稳定，我传了一份到网盘菩萨蓝奏云，不过后续的版本懒得传了，有条件还是去 github 下吧。

 Even Windows likes to crash sometimes on boot( this is the last time I'm buying a new laptop chip at launch). 
 Anyway, Open Suse Leap + Gnome just works. Even Xfce was crashing. Something I did notice though. Occasionally the screen will sorta pause. Gnome recovers this somehow. After a second it will star working again. Not Xfce. Not arch... Only on Leap + Gnome.
 I had a 5 hour session last night. No crashes. 
 I've been a software engineer for about a decade. But this is like magic. 
 Anyway, I'm spending my Friday night with Open Suse.

还买过一个二手的 HHKB ，一来想确认是不是这玩意真得好用，二来考察一下自己是否习惯键位。后来官方出了蓝牙双模版的时候就果断买了个全新的。用到现在。
之前在一个冬天零下三十度的地方读书，所以买了一件🇨🇦鹅 Langford Parka 。 折合人民币一万出头。很贵，但是这玩意也是真的保暖。同样希望它能陪我度过接下来 30 个冬天。

很多领域里的产品，如果从低端的买起，不断地更新升级，到最后可能花的钱比直接一步到位还多。初期获得的体验水平也是不如退烧品的。但是真的买这么贵的东西还是要谨慎决策，毕竟谁的钱也不是大风刮来的。所以想来听听大家的推荐，减少决策失误。]]></summary>

 I'm thinking that low power requirements of arm would be a good fit for keeping an always on system relatively cheap.
 If so, what's distributions would you recommend?
 What mini pc or hardware should I look at purchasing? Something equivalent to an intel nuc, but for arm, perhaps?
 I did initially think of an apple silicon mac mini but, as I understand it, the Linux subsystem would be used via macos host anyway. So I assumed Linux host might be better, cutting out the middleman.
 Thoughts?

        <id>https://www.v2ex.com/t/1074522#reply3</id>
        <link href="https://www.v2ex.com/t/1074522#reply3"/>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[看我这大晚上发帖，你们应该能想到我现在的心情，纯粹牢骚一下。也许你会说发牢骚干嘛不去 RSSHub repo 下。额，主要还是因为我已经放弃了给它写源了，所以也不打算去 repo 下多引发争议。
事情经过：
有个喜欢的歌手的网站没有 rss ，rsshub 也没有相应的源，于是看了下 rsshub 的开发文档开始写源，想着写好了我也能提个 pr
结果写到后来直接把我写得绷不住了，最大的问题：rsshub 作为专门将网页解析成 rss 的项目，实际上本质就是个大型的爬虫。而作为一个爬虫，请求各种网站的时候你肯定需要有一点反爬对策的。比如我期待就是 RSSHub 会提供一些网络请求的接口如 .get() .post() 来给我们调用，底层一些简单的杂活累活就由 RSSHub 来负责，我只需要提供相应请求信息之类的，然后对结果进行解析 or 处理更复杂的页面逻辑 or 反爬逻辑
结果在请求网页的时候，RSSHub 几乎没有提供任何工具。它让开发者直接用 ofetch 这个包跳过 RSSHub 直接去请求网页。网络请求的所有细节和繁杂工作全都要每个源作者自己去处理。
最让我难受非 cookie 莫属。所有涉及到 cookie 的操作全都需要第三方源作者自己来处理。而很多网站反爬又很依赖 cookie 。ofetch 作为一个网络请求包并不具备任何 cookie 相关功能，一切都要你手动处理。你需要提取出返回头里的 Set-Cookie 信息，然后解析出来，然后手动放到下一次请求头里，下次如果返回值 Set-Cookie 你又要手动更新处理等等。关键是 js 里 cookie 解析，CookieJar 之类包又极其难用。体验极其坐牢
你也许会说，处理这么麻烦你不会写点 helper 函数？是的，其他源作者也是这么想的，所以导致现在 RSSHub 项目数不清的源里，非常多作者都各自独立造了 cookie 轮子或者单独用自己的方式在用 cookie
除此之外网络请求没有比较统一的资源池，要爬取一个列表中所有文章信息，官方文档直接让你 Promise.all([get(), get(), get()]) 暴力请求，也没有任何针对网站请求速率进行控制的相关工具。所有东西全要自己实现。我越是写到后来越觉得奇怪，我感觉 RSSHub 怎么看着就是个非常简陋的前端展示框架啊。整个系统中最麻烦复杂的网络请求部分全都一股脑地扔给了源开发者，RSSHub 本身地工作实际上就是调用源然后渲染成 rss 这么简单
那么这就有个问题了，RSSHub 写源花费的这功夫和我直接新建个项目起个简单服务器然后直接调用 http clinet 然后整形成 rss 好像没区别啊？那我干嘛不去选其他在网络请求方面更适合人类的语言和工具]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[据我所知有两种主流盗刷方法：
一、给目标发假的苹果安全提醒短信，诱导目标点击链接，输入 ID 密码和两步验证码，拿到后为所欲为，直接登录设备盗刷，或登录官网添加信任手机建立家庭组拉其他 ID 盗刷，都可以。这种好理解。
二、用盗刷者的 ID 发起绑定支付方式的请求，把这种请求做成链接发给目标，目标点击后可能压根不仔细看就习惯性密码、生物验证了，支付方式就绑到盗刷者的 ID 上了。
我对第二种盗刷方式的绑定时间有点不理解。链接发给目标，目标点击链接，密码、生物验证后，盗刷者可以选择延迟绑定支付方式吗？
我一个网友说在闲鱼买视频会员上当了，对方发个链接他点了，习惯性验证了，当时也没什么反应，就没在意。凌晨四点多，支付 App 内通知显示支付方式绑上了，接着开始盗刷了。第二天才发现支付方式是凌晨四点多绑上的，那个时间绝对在睡觉。
还有个疑问，如果被第二种方式绑定后，自行通过支付 App 端解除了支付方式绑定，盗刷者可以通过先前拿到的权限不用密码、生物验证再绑定上吗？]]></summary>

        <id>https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41604042</id>
        <link href="https://www.inngest.com/"/>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi HN!  I’m Tony, one of the co-founders of Inngest (https://inngest.com/)
Inngest is an open-source durable workflow platform that works on any cloud.  Durable workflows are stateful, long running step functions written in code, which automatically retry on failure.  It abstracts everything about queues, event streams and state for you, letting you focus on code.  Some examples of uses:  managing stateful AI chained step functions;  managing search/rag indexes and data pipelines;  integrations and webhooks;  billing and payment flows.
Technical details:  unlike other solutions, we put lots of effort into designing our SDK’s step.run APIs to make them extremely easy to use — developer experience is the most important thing for us.
We had to design and build our own queueing system to work with multi-tenancy, batching, and debouncing, and we’re iterating on this as we move to FoundationDB.  It’s largely all Go in the backend, with a bunch of caching, clickhouse, event streams, and coordination on our behalf.  Workers are shared nothing, and run based off of the queue and execution state.
We did a post last year as we iterated on our TS SDK.  The product has changed a lot since then and wanted to show the community what’s changed as we reach 1.0:
    * Golang, Java, and Python SDKs with cross-language function invocation (across clouds, too)

    * Multi-tenant aware flow control (concurrency, throttling, debounce)

    * Batching, grouping many events into a single function call

    * Much improved dashboard, with tracing and metrics built in

    * Advanced recovery tools like function replay, temporary pausing,  bulk cancellation (with optional expressions).  No more dead letter queues!

    * Branch deploys built in, with staging env support out of the box

    * Full local testing with production parity


Wanted to say thank you to the HN community for feedback so far!  Happy Friday :)

Our most exciting result: Learned visuotactile policies for precise tasks like inserting USBs and credit card swiping, that work out-of-the-box when you replace skins! To the best of our knowledge, this has never been shown before with any existing tactile sensor.
Why is this important? For the first time, you could now collect data and train models on one sensor and expect them to generalize to new copies of the sensor -- opening the door to the kind of large foundation models that have revolutionized vision and language reasoning.
Would love to hear the community's questions, thoughts and comments!

I noticed there doesn't appear to be a built in crontab management feature to simply enable or disable cronjobs - meaning when testing shell scripts execution in crontab I was constantly entering crontab -e manually, and then commenting the cronjob in and out. Or I noticed I was frequently updating the time in the cronjob so it ran in the next minute or something.
 I realized it would be easier if the script that I was currently testing simply auto-ran every minute in crontab....but only if I could easily turn the cronjob off, make adjustments to the code, and then easily turn it back on and wait for the next minute rollover to execute; kind of like a 'cruise control mode' for shell script testing with cron.…]]></summary>

二、本以为国际学校的师资应该很强，没想到机构靠资源、关系与知名的国际学校 SAS 小学部合作，课外活动的师资严重不达标，忽悠小孩子，找英语老师直接教授 coding 课，lego 课，上课老师和备课老师是两个人，关键是制作课件的老师，英文水平也不过关，无法上课，所以找个英文老师来讲咯，英语老师也不太会编程，课堂基本问题也无法解答，那孩子有必要花钱报这个课学习吗？
三、该机构包装老师简历给家长看，涉及学历造假等问题，可见一些诚信问题，为了宣传真是煞费苦心，连最基本的一些常识性问题都讲不清楚，忽悠小一点的孩子行，大一点孩子就不想来了
四、承诺薪资的达不到，涉及诚信问题，这就有点挂羊头，先让你进来，进来之后就不是这么回事了]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[近日，黎巴嫩数千台寻呼机和对讲机被远程引爆事件发生后，国外和国内流传一段苹果手机也被远程引爆的视频，引发网友担忧。


经核实发现，该视频被张冠李戴，网传视频来自10多年前，美国一个民间科技爱好者的账号。该账号当时是制作的一个高压脉冲发生器，这种设备可以通过高压电流对物体造成破坏。博主会应网友要求拿手机等物品在这台设备上进行破坏试验，其中就包含苹果手机，且当时使用的是第一代的苹果手机。现在流传的苹果手机被引爆的视频，是被自媒体账号断章取义地裁剪了。


据悉，在我们国家正规渠道售卖的国行苹果手机，是要经过相关部门的多道检查和审批才可以上市的。


该谣言的源头是黎巴嫩近期发生的通信设备爆炸事件。在黎巴嫩多地发生寻呼机和对讲机爆炸后，网络上迅速流传出一段据称苹果手机也被远程引爆的视频。然而，这段视频实际上是被自媒体账号断章取义地裁剪自10多年前美国一个民间科技爱好者的账号。当时，该博主使用高压脉冲发生器对包括第一代苹果手机在内的多种电子设备进行了破坏试验，而非真正的远程引爆。


与谣言形成鲜明对比的是，iPhone 16 Pro在电池设计上的创新与安全性。有博主对iPhone 16 Pro进行了拆机，发现其电池采用了钢制外壳，这一设计在行业内尚属少见。钢壳电池相比传统的铝塑膜软包电池，具有更高的表面硬度和更好的电芯保护程度，同时还具备一定的散热改善效果。


拆解过程中，博主发现电池保护板位置设有泄压阀，这一设计有助于提升电池的安全性。此外，iPhone 16 Pro的电池重量比上代重了7.1g，容量达到了3582mAh，相比上代增加了308mAh。制造商为国产惠州德赛电池，采用ATL电芯。内部电芯基本填满整个空间，能量密度达到了764Wh/L，比上一代有显著提升。

家里的京东和顺丰用的都是多多买菜代收点这个公众号获取取件码，我倒是没啥意见，但是他娘的这个公众号的广告也有点太没底线了吧，每次打开第一个或者第二个必定是 NSFW 的图片，害得我每次在代收点想看取件码都得找个犄角旮旯遮遮掩掩的看，瞄一眼赶紧关掉。
当然你大可以笑话我，这些广告都是按照我的浏览/购买记录来推送的，别人的没问题，可问题是我在拼多多上从来没有买过这些东西呀，整天都是些什么“无套进入”的广告，我他妈……
我也尝试过估计点击一些其他的东西，但是也就之后一两次打开后是正常的广告，过一段时间还是推送这些 NSFW 的东西。
我的确是买过一些小玩具，但都是在淘宝上买的，而且淘宝也很贴心的不会因为我买过这些就使劲在首页上给我推送这类小癖好的玩具。拼多多上我唯一一次买的类似的东西就是男士内裤，很正常的内裤，不是那种 gay gay 的类型。
真的希望能看到这个帖子的拼多多伙计们调整一下你们的广告投送方式。]]></summary>

可以回帖讨论，也可以群里面一起讨论（目前还没有😂）不知道方不方便贴 wx 群码，所以先加 wx 把，或者 tg 也行
目前已知的渠道：
1.自己跑去日本买，最近去日本，春秋往返在 1000 左右，Apple Store 需要线上购买，线下购买好像强制日本的一种分期形式（ pxxid) 记不太清了，电器城 据说缺货严重，但是可以退税。
2.找代购，咸鱼的代购费高的吓人，问了一下，1200 的手续费，运费自付，还要其他费用，有点劝退。感觉不如方案 1
3.Apple Store 官网购买，tenso 转运到香港，人肉去香港取（适合靠近香港的城市）。转运到大陆，需要 13%的关税。加上转运费，不知道是否比代购便宜。但是这个可以保证货没问题。遇上什么海外消费返现活动，还能便宜点。
4.如果有日本朋友，可以自己官网买，寄到朋友家，让朋友 EMS 寄回来，或者香港之类的。
目前已知这四种方式，希望 V 友多多交流，也想过去免签国家，马来西亚，但是机票好像挺贵的😂

3.OD offer 能不能拿了作为筹码找别的公司试试]]></summary>

在前东家做前端主力开发，在去年至今年 4 月期间部门架构调整和相关工作量的提升，负责 20+的 Git 仓库源码同时兼顾其他业务线的项目，其中非常活跃的项目有 15+个 Git ，期间前后三次提薪申请都未通过，最后再因为部分无法公开的原因（全网同 ID 和头像怕熟人看到🥲，所以不好说～）再加一点点的冲动，就去跟直属 Leader 商量沟通好，完成所有项目交接妥善后，选择了跑路哈哈～
6 月初提桶裸辞，中间休息了一个半月，7 月中跟前前同事（后端架构）联系我跟他一起搞了下 AIGC 的产品，负责前端项目的基建和业务开发（现在我负责的部分已结束，朋友那边还需要部分业务微调和部署事项的处理）。过程自己尝试自媒体和技术型副业的相结合来引流铺张，结果是效益甚微哈哈～很难受…
个人概览
Blog：我的博客（资料和联系方式也在这，仿 Anthony Fu 佬的风格
简历的话还要脱敏啥的就没折腾搞在线版了，如果佬们对我感兴趣的话可以来个小红点加一个绿 V 或企鹅私发？（随便背调）
给个大概介绍：
技术：

自认为偏前端且综合性能力还行？对自己的规划在Web 开发和工程基建的方向。
PS：
个人认为较好的项目背景就是在前东家做了知名车企（ BBA 中的某个 B ）数字转型的 4S 店相关系统和前前东家的工厂/实验室系统依赖标准件库（一个私有 npm ），个人条件里最差的就是学历太难看了（非统考的本科），如果佬们对这方面要求十分严格，那也属实无奈了～

Found an open box Dell Inspiron 14 2 n 1 i7(Gen 12?), 16GB, 1 TB & ext 1TB Drive at Best Buy($725 with tax) I booted into Windows 11 to test all the hardware. It took 2 days because it had a windows device driver issue. I also made sure to get the digital license in my Microsoft Account. I used balenaEtcher to setup the install of Ubuntu. Started the install sharing the windows drive. Had to boot into windows and turn off bitlocker, including getting the boot unlocked via Microsoft.com. Started again had it get stuck while adding WiFI. Told it to just install without updates. It installed quickly.
 I was up and using Linux in under an hour. All the hardware works. Ubuntu works better than Windows 11. This is a non-conical dell. 
 TL;DR - It was faster to get up and running with Ubuntu than the pre-installed Win11. The drivers installed flawlessly on Linux, but not on Windows.

 My first C program. Its more of a script than a program really. I had something I was trying to achieve.
 IDK maybe someone finds it useful somewhere out there in the ether.
 For those wondering why, I was trying to fit an installer iso in a github release (2GB MAX).
 Here is the window manager config from it XD
 It would work with xterm too im just doing this rn
 The alacritty config runs it before starting the shell, but you could run this like, a bunch of ways, as long as its ran after you open the window
  services.xserver.enable = true; services.xserver.desktopManager.session = (let alakitty = pkgs.callPackage ./alatoml.nix { inherit tx maximize_alacritty; shellStr = "${pkgs.${login_shell}}/bin/${login_shell}"; }; in [ { name = "alacritty"; start = /*bash*/ '' ${pkgs.xorg.xrandr}/bin/xrandr --output Virtual-1 --primary --preferred sleep 0.5 ${pkgs.alacritty}/bin/alacritty --config-file ${alakitty} & waitPID=$!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The website is pretty neat because the webpages are written like a proper man page. Simple and readable.
 In particular, I find "dnscheck.tools" to be very useful when testing your custom DNS resolvers (NextDNS, Quad9, Cloudfare, etc) are working properly. You can also use this to test if your VPN connection is working properly. 
 As I am a home user, that's all the usefulness I can think of.
 Perhaps the networking professionals and other members of the IT community might find this useful as well in a small business or Enterprise environment?
 You'd have to tell me. I wouldn't know.

我给它 [ 4 星] ： 国家的视角 聚焦于对极端现代主义的批判。
现代化并非坏事。欧美等进入现代是人类社会发展的自然阶段。而极端现代主义，是指一些后发国家地区为了追赶，采用计划和强制的方式进行社会改造，动用国家暴力机关推行现代化进程。虽然出发点和目的是为了人的福祉，但过度简化的计划异化了人，脱离了现实，强制的手段引发了抵制甚至反抗。在哄哄烈烈的运动过去之后，是旧有秩序的崩坏与信秩序的失败。而勉强存下来的新系统，也是因为在规划之外的另一套系统的滋生，支撑了表面的有序。
站在国家的视角，因为税收和管理需求，对社会的方方面面有简化和规范的需求。比如，人们有姓氏，是方便征税与征兵。现代国家的发展，也越来越让世界各国有了同质化的迹象。
读国家的视角这本书时，头脑中总是想起道德经中说的治大国如烹小鲜，意思是别瞎折腾。
而现代国家无一例外，都在加强对社会和民众的控制。而某些后发国家为了快速现代化，采取了极端现代主义的做法，在林业规划，城市建设，农村迁移等等方面，采取了简化与独裁的方式推进项目。因为不顾自然规律、个人能动性、和实践知识而盲目暴力推进项目的做法，往往造成巨大失败和灾难。

去年得了挺严重的抑郁症的，也做了很极端的事情，例如割腕。
疫情的时候没有让自己崩塌，却在后疫情时代没让自己熬过去。
我是一个怎么说呢，好听了叫知足常乐，不好听了叫不思进取的一个人。如果生活过得去，其实我一直都是没心没肺的傻笑着面对生活的一个人，也可能像我高中的班主任说的那样，我能在每个人面前都装的很无所谓。
这两年垮掉，我自己回头看，我仍然没找到原因。
原本自己经营着一家小手机店，后来还在拼多多上开了网店做照片打印，自学了开发写了个小程序还来论坛上推广过。不过实体店生意越来越差，网店也开得纯粹是为平台打工，越来越没有动力。

        <id>https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41593216</id>
        <link href="https://playground.numscript.org/"/>
        <updated>2024-09-19T15:59:19.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Numscript is a simple, declarative language that helps you model financial transactions. You can do quite a few things with it, such as modeling:
* Payments involving vouchers and a user's prepaid balance
* Complex funds destination scenario where the customer gets cash back
* Configurable user credit balance spending transactions
The main idea is to take the pain out of describing of a system dealing with money movements should behave in traditional languages such as JS/TS/Go/Ruby etc, landing an expressive way to model these movements of value.
It is voluntarily broad in applicability—our customers use it today for use-cases ranging from marketplaces funds orchestration to home-grown loan management systems.
Once those transactions are modeled, they are to be picked up and committed to a system-of-record, ledgering system or executed on a set of payments and banking APIs.
It was initially a DSL we bundled into our Core Ledger product at Formance (YCS21) but we're giving it more autonomy now and started to make it standalone, with the idea that anyone could eventually bolt Numscript on top of their ledgering system. We're also exploring to make it natively compatible with other backends.
As part of this un-bundling, we've just shipping a playground which lets you fiddle with it without installing anything at https://playground.numscript.org/ (it works best on desktop).
Happy to chime in on any questions!

 I just had to share this, after nearly 25 years of using Linux, I’ve never experienced such incredible stability as I have over the past two years with some laptop with this base HW configuration. It’s been rock-solid with impressively power, efficiency, seamless GPU switching.
 Working/gaming on distros: Ubuntu, Debian, PopOS , and Arch.
 Long life to AMD systems 🔥💻

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[环境
电脑 --- 路由器 --- 跳板服务 --- 目标服务器
电脑 IP：10.10.*.*
路由器 Wireguard IP：192.168.69.1
要访问的远程服务器 IP：17.*.*.*
问题
电脑在内网，路由器上配置了 Wireguard ，Wireguard 另一端跳板服务在公网。现在内网的电脑想通过 Wireguard 访问到公网的服务器的 QUIC 协议的服务。
现在情况是，如果不走 Wireguard ，电脑通过路由器是可以正常访问到目标服务的，没有问题。但是配置走了 Wireguard ，就无法正常访问了。
conntrack 和 Wireshark 抓包的结果：


看起来是电脑在发送 QUIC 请求，服务端返回了响应包，但是电脑对收到的每个响应包都会回一个 ICMP Port unreachable 的响应，导致连接立即被中断 DESTROY 。
尝试排查
因为 QUIC 协议是基于 UDP 的，所以我拿 Node.JS 简单写了个测试程序，在服务器上监听 UDP 端口，做一个 echo 服务，电脑上给服务端发 UDP 请求，服务端给返回多个响应包：
服务端：
import dgram from 'node:dgram';

const server = dgram.createSocket('udp4');
server.bind(443);

server.addListener('message', async (msg, rinfo) => {
    console.log(`Received ${msg.length} bytes from ${rinfo.address}:${rinfo.port}: ${msg}`);
    for (let i = 0; i < 5; ++i) {
        // 延迟 1 秒
        await new Promise(r => setTimeout(r, 1e3));
        server.send(Buffer.concat([msg, Buffer.from(i.toString())]), rinfo.port, rinfo.address, (error, bytes) => {
            console.log('send to', rinfo.address, rinfo.port, error, 'bytes', bytes);
        });
    }
});

客户端：
import dgram from 'node:dgram';

const socket = dgram.createSocket('udp4');

socket.addListener('message', (msg, rinfo) => {
    console.log(`Received ${msg.length} bytes from ${rinfo.address}:${rinfo.port}: ${msg}`);
});

socket.send("asd", 443, " [脱敏，远端 IP ] ");

结果是正常的，电脑上运行客户端代码，会用一个随机端口给服务器的 443 发请求，服务端收到的包显示远端 IP 是 Wireguard 远端的 IP ，表示数据包确实是走 Wireguard 转发到服务端的，然后服务端回复给 Wireguard 远端的 5 个包也都能正常被内网的电脑收到。
目前没有其他头绪了，来求助问一下，还有什么方向可以排查的吗？可能是什么问题呢？]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[各位好，我又来请教个 Vue3 的问题，标签页系统使用 defineComponent 创建组件，实现刷新功能。由于组件需要缓存，使用了 keepalive ，于是用 pinia 存储组件的 name 属性，所以创建时在 name 加上时间戳将其表示唯一。
GitHub 地址
createNode.js的部分代码片段如下，本意是想看下创建组件时的时间戳：
function getTimeStamp() {
  let timeNow = Date.now();
  console.log("create: ", timeNow);
  return timeNow;
}

export function createNameComponent(component) {
  return () => {
    return new Promise((resolve) => {
      component().then((comm) => {
        const tempComm = defineComponent({
          name: (comm.default.name || "vueAdminBox") + "_" + getTimeStamp(),
          props: comm.default.props || {},
          ...

当前实现效果如下：

可以看到，组件只有第一次打开时会触发getTimeStamp函数，关闭再打开就不会重新获取时间戳了。
我期望每次打开标签页都是不同的时间戳，有老哥遇到这个问题吗？]]></summary>

修改后本地访问以及刷新正常，打包后发布开发环境，首次访问正常，页面刷新后异常，打开控制台发现
访问页面加载资源
/xxx/xxxxxxxxx/test
加载对应 js 异常，初步判断应该是打包资源路径的问题，这个 vue 项目是单页面应用

路由器和几台设备是紧挨着测试的，不存在隔墙或隔金属的问题。
Windows 插网线能跑满不掉速说明 NAS 那边没问题。所有设备（ Mac,Win,iPhone,Redmi ）连接 WiFi 最快的也只能跑一半，是我设置不对还是路由器虚标？

由于域名每段长度必须大于 0 小于 64 ，因此边界位置不能使用点号，只能使用剩余的 38 个字符，因此总体编码率略低于 Base39 。
当然这个域名不够短，本来还可以再多存储几个字节的信息。不过短域名比较贵，暂时不折腾。
另外 HTTPS 也是个麻烦事，目前只给一级域名用上证书，其他的仍然是 HTTP 。]]></summary>

 I'm not looking for a video based course like Udemy or Coursera stuffs. It should explain theories, not just practical stuff. 
 I'm learning this for University and the book I have is confusing, information feels all over the place, and there's like gazillion commands (yes I need to learn everything that's in my book for exams, final could be pen paper based). The book is Evi Nemeth et al. - UNIX and Linux System Administration Handbook-Addison-Wesley (2017).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey everyone,
 IDK if you have the same problems, but I had an idea that might make screen sharing on Linux a lot more secure and private. Picture this: you’re sharing your screen on Discord, OBS, or any other screen share app, and you accidentally reveal something you didn’t mean to—like passwords or private files. It’s a common concern, and I think there might be a way to address it.
 What if we had a feature where you could easily mark parts of your screen as “sensitive,” and the compositor would automatically blur or hide those areas during screen sharing or recording? For example, you could set up certain regions or windows to be censored so that they don’t show up in the recording or stream.
 On top of that, we could take it a step further with machine learning. Imagine having a system that can automatically detect sensitive information—like passwords, IP addresses, or credit card numbers—and blur those parts in real-time. This way, you wouldn’t have to manually mark everything; the system could handle it based on common patterns.
 Does this sound useful to anyone else? I’d love to hear your thoughts or any ideas on how that could work.
 Looking forward to your feedback!

 I have a question about Linux support on Snapdragon X Elite processors, especially with the release of kernel 6.11. I saw a few posts about this ARM processor around 3 months ago, but back then, the support was partial, and it wasn't clear what exactly wouldn't work.
 Now that kernel 6.11 is out, I'm wondering if things have improved. Has anyone tried installing Linux on a laptop with this processor? I'm considering buying one if the Linux support is decent.
 I'd appreciate any feedback or advice!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[一周前在 Apple 官网下单了标准玻璃+支持倾斜度调节的款式，11499 元，上手后发现有明显的电流噪声和风扇噪声，尝试各类方法无果，前两天申请了退货，今天顺丰小哥把东西取走了。还是来说说个人的上手体验吧，顺便一提，自己的设备是 Mac mini ，此前搭配使用的是 BenQ PD2706U：
显示效果非常细腻震撼，并且由于分辨率的提升，显示内容比 BenQ 大了一整圈。
唤醒速度快，1s 左右，相比之下 BenQ 需要 5s 唤醒。
麦克风音质不错。
SDR 亮度可达 600nit ，亮度适当调高一些，观感真的不一样，而 BenQ 只有 350nit ，很多时候觉得是不够的。
机身做工拉满，全铝合金外壳+底座，倾斜度调节非常顺滑。
抗反光涂层效果出色，只要不是在黑色背景下，几乎察觉不到反光，同时不失镜面屏的通透观感，再回头看 BenQ 会有一种雾蒙蒙的感觉。
弹幕滚动比较丝滑，没有明显拖影，而 BenQ 有明显的顿挫感。
漏光控制一般。
摄像头画质一般。
不支持 HDR ，但藉由 macOS 的色彩管理系统还是可以播放 HDR 内容的，但 600nit 的亮度只能说是能看。
音响听着比较闷，但基本素质是有的，没有明显的偏音问题。
边框较宽，一定程度上影响观感。
随机出现明显的电流噪声和风扇噪声，这个缺点把前面所说的优点全部盖过了，严重影响日常使用。入手之前我已经了解到可能会有这个问题，但是抱着试试看的心态还是入手了一台，没想到还是不行。搜了下 B 站，有说是电源线屏蔽没做好导致的，有说是用电质量导致的，总之我更新固件、加屏蔽磁环、换滤波插排都试过了，没一个奏效的，遂弃疗。
总结：如果没有噪声问题，必然是不会退货的，但既然中奖也没有办法，我也懒得换货了，毕竟换货还是一样的问题可就尴尬了，而且到时候也没法退货了。排除掉这点，综合来看 SD 无疑是 Mac 能搭配使用的最佳显示器，它不像 Pro Display XDR 那样价格高昂、体积庞大，同时又集成了摄像头、麦克风和音响，很多情况下确实能省不少事，再搭配出色的 P3 广色域和系统内置的调节功能，方方面面都走在竞品前列，当然价格也走在前列就是了。]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[前提
我看过 steam 的政策，虽然有非游戏的软件，但是似乎要求软件需要和游戏领域有些关联。
想法来源
我最近给几个朋友做了几个垂直领域的软件，直接解决对方需求，对方付费意愿高
我也和他们聊了，为什么要定制，主要是很难找到定制的软件，找到了也不一定满足需求
期间也去了解了另外几个垂直领域圈子，一样也有需求，其实很多技术人员也已经深耕垂直领域，闷声发大财了
萌生想法
想做一个 PC 软件的分发平台， 类似 steam 的角色
统一下载，统一的 issue 反馈机制， 统一的评价体系
引进 EA 众筹机制，解决独立开发者早期收入问题，我和好几个客户聊过，是可以接受的。
解决问题
平台统一分发，付费，授权问题等等
平台营销，集中￥，效果应该会好点
做为中间商桥接用户和技术供应商, 可以通过平台的 issue , 评论系统等优化沟通效率
针对垂直行业还可以进行 EA 众筹的方式解决一些小软件的预付款需求
存在问题
PC 软件真实需求？
版权版号，软件行业基本好解决，只是有一点点小成本，如果优秀软件，平台可以提供奖励机制解决。
想和 V 友探讨探讨可行性。]]></summary>

人在深圳，为了省钱租在了九楼无电梯。
承：
目前在美团点了 4 次外卖，3 次都是骑手发现无电梯后直接让我报餐损，1 次是只能给我送到七楼。
饿了么点了 1 次，那个骑手打电话暗示我，要么放楼下，要么给我“加餐”。
转：
投诉的话，只能说美团的人工客服接通倒是挺快的，说是平台没有明确规定，所以爬楼无上限。
结：
找过一个小哥问了，他说：“一个单子配送路程 5km ，骑手到手 4.5 元，超时扣 3.5 元，与其爬楼还不如给自己回血。”（还顺手抓了个商家问了一下，我实付 36 的单子，他到手才 23 ）
序：无解，成功戒掉了夜宵和奶茶和各种廉价外卖，妈妈再也不用担心我半夜十二点吃烧烤了。
破：不过好在朴朴、盒马、山姆、京东大件都能送货上门而且没有多哔哔，所以现在都自己做饭了。
急：急急急，手上十几张红包用不出去（]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[继之前请教各位杭州行情之后  
入口
因为已经几年没有面试了，整理简历之后，以杭州为目标，开始投简历，这次有个明显的感受
可选的职位实在是太少，大量的外包+部分小团队(20-99 人）+ 几个头部大厂在招聘(但是感觉不太像真的找人），以我个人的工作经历和学历，大厂接受简历之后基本无后续，小公司薪资和业务落差较大，外包目前无感，导致没几个公司可选，远不像前几年，猎头主动联系，中厂很容易进面
杭州的互联网公司，主要的业务范围很单一，主要是在线教育(以 AI 为噱头）、LOT 、电商为主，能选择的岗位很少很少
加班当家常便饭，大小周也是常态，面试时和 HR 沟通，都会表示大小周+加班，基本上每天要在公司待满 12h
谈薪基本不存在，HR 一口价，没有沟通空间，至少我遇到的是这样
卷到极致，除了午休时间，没看到有什么喘息时间，每个人仿佛精力无限，一坐就是一天，而且同事之间关系较为冷淡，除了工作没什么关于生活或者娱乐的沟通
其他感受，空气湿润，鼻炎确实不再犯了
待了两周，感觉很压抑，总结出这几个点，记录一下]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[我在今年一月离职，今天入职了新公司。
当时工作压力很大，看到周围的人陆陆续续活水或离职，女朋友也支持我，于是我也下定了决心，裸辞。那时候我工作了一年半，想着我存款多，有猫猫，有爱我的女朋友，怕什么。于是义无反顾地往前走，不知道接下来的半年会那么难熬。
女朋友在上海找到了实习，于是我们和猫咪一起从北京搬到了上海，这时是二月份。
我一直对互联网很感兴趣，反正也辞职了，索性做了一个工具类的产品，二月份就上线了第一版，在 reddit ，product hunt ，hacker news 上推荐自己。结果当然是像大多数人一样，我没有做出改变世界或者至少改变一个小行业的产品的能力，几乎处于无人问津的状态。那段时间也凭借缘分面了一两个公司，理所当然地告吹，不过我完全没有在意。我们领养了第二只猫咪，跟她的姓，哈哈哈。她给我带饭，带可乐，我的吃喝全仰仗着她。这样一直到了 5 月份。
5 月 6 号那天，女朋友提出了分手，我们前前后后总结了更改添加了很多分手的理由，难以捉摸。我或许隐隐约约有一些预感，不过似乎没有把它和分手联系在一起。突如其来的晴天霹雳，哭啊哭一连哭了好几天。
后来去了上海精神卫生中心看病，不严重，医生让我多运动。于是我每天下午晚上出门遛弯，至少从表面上好点了。这段时间有用户给我发消息，说或许我可以为我的产品收费，我也想看看我能否靠它养活自己，于是添加了收费的功能，陆陆续续维护到现在，它给我挣了 1000+美元。
浑浑噩噩到了七月，我下定决心开始疯狂找工作，注册了 boss 直聘，天天看有没有人招工。字节二面挂完一面挂，阿里二面挂，蚂蚁三面挂完 HR 面挂，携程一面挂。9 月份终于让我找到了现在的工作，跳去了前司的竞对，造化弄人。
前两天台风过境，我刚刚搬了家，离开了伤心又留恋的地方，开始了新生活，外面呼啸的狂风框框作响的门框没有吓到我，也没有吓到我的猫咪，我和它相依为命，希望靠台风一扫过去的阴霾。
今天是入职的第一天，晚上回到出租屋，记流水账一样记下了也许在多年后回头看是改变人生的转折点，不过现在谁知道呢？马上就 12 点了，洗洗澡睡睡觉，明天终究还是要向前看。]]></summary>

We are Michael & Jono, and we are building Cerebrium (https://www.cerebrium.ai), a serverless infrastructure platform for ML/AI applications - we make it easy for engineers to build, deploy and scale AI applications.
Initially, we’ve been hyper-focused on the inference side of applications, but we’re working on expanding our functionality to support training and data processing use cases—eventually covering the full AI development lifecycle.
You can watch a quick loom video of us deploying: https://www.loom.com/share/06947794b3bf4bb1bb21c87066dfcc66?...
How we got here:
Jono and I led the technical team at our previous e-commerce startup, which grew rapidly over a few years. As we scaled, we were tasked with building out ML applications to make the business more efficient. It was to…]]></summary>

 Dropbox's syncing tech works well for this, but Dropbox to go (for reasons). Some other things I've tried:
  
I'm currently using Nextcloud. It has its pros and cons, and I'm actually going to use it to replace part of Dropbox. [Eg for getting photos off of phone and other larger file syncing.] But: A) it's a little too complex for long-term sustainability, IMO. [Eg for "decadeS" of use like dropbox will soon be approaching], granted comparing paid cloud to self-hosted open-source; B) its not suitable for script syncing, as it currently doesn't sync the execute bit.

 Edit: thank you everyone for sharing your opinions and knowledge. There are so many responses and I didn't expect such a great discussion. All of you have enlightened me and made me come out of my comfort zone. I'm now eager to learn more. I hope this post will be useful for everyone who may have the same question in future. Thanks for all your comments. Please don't stop commenting and sharing your knowledge and opinion. PS: Now I should go and read dozens of comments and search the whole web :D

2.等 2500-2600 抄，你的止损需要是前前期低点 2440 左右，胜率适中
3.再下就不适合抄底了，可能要等很长时间 1 开头？说太早了没有太大意义
ps:只是给小白的简单参考。因为入场是相对简单的事情，入场以外的才是最难最考验人的。
ps2:理性讨论，勿出现类似以下垃圾评论：
悲观派：
1.无药可救：缅 A 有什么分析的必要吗？
2.痴心妄想：还在对缅 A 心存幻想？
3.韭菜噩梦：缅 A 就是骗局，是全球独苗
4.有理有据：根据 xxx 以及 xxx ，缅 A 现在还没到底
5.舍近求远：美股都涨疯辣，还盯着缅 A ？
6.好奇宝宝：有点好奇，为什么你们天天盯着缅 A 不放？
7.不如钓鱼：花时间研究缅 A ，不如去钓鱼
乐观派：
1.火速出击：等什么呢？还不快速速梭哈抄底
2.卖房卖肾：跑步进场，已经卖房卖肾加仓了
3.未卜先知：怎么看我都预感到这就是底了
有意义的讨论：
1.萌新提问：大佬们，A 股现在的基本面和技术面怎么结合去看呢？
2.小白求教：A 股这行情，我该买点压压惊，还是观望学习先？
3.稳中求进：想问问大家都是怎么分批进场的？
4.风险意识：风险这块咱们该怎么控制呢？
5.长期观察：是不是要再等个几个月，看走势再决定入不入？
6.资金管理：在当前复杂的市场环境下，如何合理控制仓位，避免过度风险暴露？
7.外部因素：宏观经济和政策变化，这些因素会对未来走势有怎样的影响？]]></summary>

外观
屏幕大了一点点，但是也宽了（和 14p 一样了）
新颜色类似 ip8 的金色（他对比的是 xs 金色😂）
钛金属边框工艺从拉丝改成喷砂
屏幕边框窄了一点点
重了
功能上
散热好些了，充电没变化
新加的拍摄按钮交互多，但是不好用。猜测是作为 AI 入口
摄影风格没怎么看懂，貌似是人物 p 图？
新的镀膜还是没有抑制炫光
拍摄竟然没有跟前代 15p 比较，反而是跟安卓旗舰比。ip 录像貌似一直是比安卓强的
空间照片（没有 vp 没啥用）
运动模式（自动调整更快的快门？）
总之在我看来这一代真的是没有任何亮点。反而 16 的 ram 和 pro 对齐让我觉得标准版还显得有点儿诚意。]]></summary>

后端: Gin, Gorm, PostgreSQL, Nats (py 爬虫), Coze
前端: Nuxt， Vue, arco-design, tailwindcss
遇到了几个问题
爬虫并不是官方接口，虽然做了分布式处理但还是很麻烦，速度也很慢,
提示词的优化空间还很大，但是coze真的卡，还经常报错，错误内容啥也不说真的一坨
然后能拿到 视频内容（总结+字幕），评论区（二层递归）, 差不多 5-10 个视频总结一版，总流程耗时 4-5 分钟
总结出的种类也挺少的，不知道还有没有啥有意思的种类
测试预览地址： https://zuiti.ocyss.icu/ 
ps： 搜索禁用了，1h mini 服务器，大佬手下留情
虽然没技术上没啥难度, 但写起来还挺麻烦的，后续也会开源，不过开源前打算先捞一笔，不然房租都交不起了]]></summary>

看到苹果加强了密码这个 app 其实刚开始还是挺开心的, 因为 1Password 8 改成订阅制, 所以一直停留在 1Password 7 这个版本
昨天尝试了一下迁移, 首先从 1Password 中将密码导出为 csv, 然后导入到 Apple Password. 因为我之前一直是两者共用, iCloud 钥匙串主要用于自动填充, 所以出现了不少重复项. 刚开始有接近一千个密码, 去重花费了好几个小时
去重的过程中对密码进行了整理, 发现 1Password 中的附加项是无法导入的, 比如路由器有 2.4G/5G/6G 和后台登录密码, 这些导入的时候要么丢失, 要么空的, 要么就是没有任何名称的密码. 另外, 群组在导入的时候好像是直接失败
Apple Password 感觉像是半成品, 我最需要的群组/密码分类 (像 1Password 那样分成网页密码, 纯密码, 服务器, 路由器等这种) 都没有, 另外产生密码也不能像 1Password 那样自定义, 只有两种固定格式固定长度可选
好在 1Password 7 在 macOS 15 上可以正常使用, 也不算完全没成果吧, 至少整理了 iCloud 钥匙串里那好几年没动过的密码, 删掉了一些关闭的网站]]></summary>

最烦人的问题就出在 Patreon 的通知设置上，你可以在设置中决定自己需要订阅哪些类别的通知，但是这些 General 类型的通知都和创作者没关系，每个创作者的通知都要单独点进去关闭，这就跟在 iPhone 上为某个 app 单独设置权限一样。而且每当你关了一个通知类别，还要等一会儿，等系统响应完了才能关另一个，如果你眼疾手快，下场可能就是你所做的改动全都没保存……是的，就算对于同一个作者，你也不能一次性关闭有关他的所有通知，使用体验极差。而且如果下次 Patreon 又更新了别的通知类别，你就又得点进来关一次……我真吐了。
后来一气之下想删除账户，找了半天都找不到删除账户的入口或者按钮，到最后还得发邮件申请……真有够恶心的。
最奇怪的是，我寻思着，那我取关这个创作者总行了吧？然后我进入了我关注的其中一个创作者的主页的网页版，找了半天也没找到类似于「取关」的按钮，只有屏蔽跟举报，但是屏蔽的作用和取关又大相径庭……这些开发者到底是怎么想的？]]></summary>

卫星 SOS: 大陆没开通, 只在旅行到开通地区有用, 个人用处不大
eSIM 不太方便, 但 estk.me 可替, 灵活性比 1+1 还更好些
FT Audio: 是个问题,但不怎么用 FT, 可有可无
WIFI7 6G: 是个问题,但目前没有这种 AP, 近期也没有打算升级
无线充: 是个问题, 但是基本不用无线充,发热太大了
tw 旗: 不使用,无所谓

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm still new to Linux (experimenting since like may, using primarily since August) but I just can't figure out why people insist on recommending Linux mint. Maybe I'm missing something here, but if you are looking for windows-esque UI then kde plasma is way better than cinnamon, and if you want stuff like better driver handling and "noob friendly" tools like pop! Os has then tuxedo os is the same deal as pop! Os but with plasma. I did try Linux mint when I was just trying to figure out what distro to use and it's one of two distros (other one is mainline Ubuntu) where I had major issues out of the box. Even if that weren't the case, I just don't see how it's relevant at all when something like tuxedo os is there doing the same thing with a better desktop environment.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When it comes to the iPhone 16 Pro, users will be able to choose from the following options:
JPEG Lossless (Most Compatible)
JPEG-XL Lossy
JPEG-XL Lossless
Apple also highlights how much storage each format takes up:
11 MB for JPEG-XL Lossy ProRAW at 12 MP
18 MB for JPEG-XL Lossless ProRAW at 12 MP
20 MB for JPEG-XL Lossy ProRAW at 48 MP
46 MB for JPEG-XL Lossless ProRAW at 48 MP
For comparison, a 48MP ProRAW photo taken on the iPhone 15 Pro takes up around 75MB.
Although only iPhone 16 Pro models can take JPEG-XL photos, any Apple devices running iOS 17 and later or macOS 14 and later can view images in this format.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I’m looking to replace my M2 Macbook Air, the best computer I ever had by a long shot, with a Linux laptop.
 I have Linux experience since easily 15 years on and off, actually ever since Linux on the desktop was always gonna be next year ;), so I'm aware that the kind of hardware/software integration that Apple offers is completely unmatchable on Linux.
 But hardware I can choose, so I’m looking for a device with:
  
ideally no fan
 very good all-day battery life (at least)
 very good hibernation integration with minimal power consumption (the always-on state of the unexhaustable Macbook Air battery is probably its most important user experience feature of the device)
 small and lightweight, ideally below 13" screen
 good overall Linux integration; camera etc are basics and should work; I understand that nothing is perfect
 hi-def screen, so no old devices
 bonus points for a fingerprint scanner. It might not be widely supported now, but that can change
  
If I would give up any of these, it would the the fan. I could live with a fan if I can throttle the chips because computing power is not a strong requirement for me.
 TLDR: I need an awesome traveling computer as a replacement for the MBAir. I’m weary of everything corporations are doing and want to opt out of the surveillance model, but I’m a sucker for convenience.
 p.s: I love the modern Gnome experience as a decades-old MacOS user.

前言
哪个男孩不想要一个可以自由驰骋互联网的网络呢？
关于家中的互联网建设这一块，已经不知道有多少博主聊过，自己也是来来回回折腾了很多种方案。
最近终于找到了我直到目前为止我认为可能是最完美的方案——PaoPaoDNS+PaoPaoGateWay 。然后就在自己家的软路由系统里部署了起来，目前也是稳定用了一个月感觉非常的舒适。
但是我家里面用的是软路由+虚拟机的方案，本身全套机器下载价格要 400 元左右了，而且机器也是做了一点点硬改，没有改机能力的人恐怕用起来也会比较麻烦。
于是我就在想，能不能用比较便宜的方案，和较低的功耗，用一些市面上常见的设备来实现这一套方案呢？
最终预期的结果
在尽可能保证正常网络不会受到影响的情况下，实现网内透明代理，以用于科学上网。
附赠功能: 去广告，虚拟局域网组网等
设备选择和采购
于是经过我的思考，最后做出了如下的设备方案:
一台硬路由，要可以刷入支持设置静态路由，静态 DHCP 的系统(OpenWRT 、爱快、ROS 等)
一台可以部署 Docker 容器的机器，例如一台小型 ARM 主机(玩客云，x905 电视盒子等)
一台低功耗 x86 小主机(最好支持 AES 硬解)
以上设备各位读者可以根据自身的经济条件和现有的设备来决定如何选择，比如全放进虚拟机里之类。而我这次选择的设备是下面这几个。
硬路由-JCG Q30 Pro: 59 元

这个价格不算特别的大众，这是一台天线坏掉的机器，而我的家里面因为还有三个其他的无线路由器当做 AP 使用，所以我不需要无线网络功能。
这台机器的芯片是联发科的 mt7981 ，内存是 256m(也有 512m 的版本)，性能较好，可以轻松跑满千兆。而且这款机器还是被 OpenWRT 和 immortalwrt 官方支持的型号，可以…]]></summary>

内网用 ros 和 openwrt 做了分流

 TL;DR: tar has been our go-to archiving tool for decades, but it's time to embrace a modern, user-friendly alternative. I'm proposing a new tool—let's call it archives—that simplifies archiving and compression, adapts over time with a dynamic database, and maintains backward compatibility. Let's start a movement to develop and adopt this tool for a better, more efficient future.
 Repo: https://github.com/tmpgithubusr/modern-archiver/
 The Limitations of tar
 We've all faced the frustrations:
  
Convoluted Syntax: Remembering the correct flags and order (tar -cvzf or was it -czvf?) can be a headache.
 Poor Documentation: The man pages are dense and not beginner-friendly, leading to confusion and errors.

这款工具的目标客户是希望通过 SEO 获取海外流量的网站；
Blogcard 采用“domain to content”的方式生成内容，即输入域名即可得到内容。
这里需要输入的域名，是指用户（网站）竞对的域名；
这里输出的内容，是基于对竞对网站访客画像，针对性生成的 blog 。
简单的说，如果你想与某个网站竞争流量，只需要输入该网站的网址，Blogcard 就能帮你生成该网站访客更爱看的内容。
我们参考 AI 工作流理论，把之前日常生产“商业化”Blog 的 SOP 自动化，从而创造了这款产品。
它的工作流大致如下：
Step1：从 Semrush 找到我的竞品，看看他们有哪些关键词拥有不错的入站流量
Step2：把这些关键词都拉出来，丢给 GPT 让它分析这些关键词搜索者背后的意图
Step3：再让 GPT 根据它自己分析的意图，针对性的建立 BLOG 标题，并生产内容

最近也一直在想，人生的意义是什么？人为什么而活着？莫非人生来就是为了去读书的苦、在吃工作的苦、婚姻的苦和生离死别之苦吗？ 
让人窒息的原生家庭环境、每次吵架都歇斯底里日渐支离破碎的感情、 越来越糟糕的工作环境…感觉自己才 30 岁不到，就像已经死了一样，心里看不到一点光。有时候很鄙视自己像个生活的懦夫，只知道抱怨….可是我明明已经够努力了，为什么生活还是这么一团糟？ 
以前我很鄙夷那些轻生的人， 毕竟能有什么事情是能够超越死亡的？直到我亲身经历一些事情之后，我仿佛也能理解了。有时候他们可能也只是不愿再去遭受那些让他们感到痛苦的一切。毕竟让我再选一次，我也不会再选择出生、结婚、买房。]]></summary>

24 年 9 月花了 3 天写好简历，golang 开发工程师，然后 boss 上面公开简历，发现一堆外包找我，然后很多因为我 gap 一年直接说简历通不过不能进入面试流程，或者直接已读不回了，我很慌张，后面终于有 3 家外包公司邀请我面试，面试了 2 家，我发现 golang 八股文答不上来，数据库 、缓存、消息队列 一些知识也答不上来了，然后就挂了。我心想外包技术面试都挂了，很受打击。但是第三家外包面试的时候表现好一点了，因为花了一天看了下八股文和数据库缓存之类的，然后几轮技术面试通过了，给我发了 offer 。所以目前只接到一个外包 offer。
我现在感觉 gap 了一年，感觉外包都看不上我，已读不回，所以我有点犹豫要不要去这个外包算了。但是我有想着我还没有尝试主动投简历，会不会还有其他机会。但是我有担心放弃这个 offer ，后面一个 offer 都没有，我需要继续 gap ，我会很焦虑的。
大家觉得怎么做合适？接受 offer ，去外包？还是尝试主动投简历，看能不能找到非外包公司？]]></summary>

        <id>https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41568343</id>
        <link href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41568343"/>
        <updated>2024-09-17T15:04:09.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi HN,
We are Cyril & Ulric and are building Marblism (https://marblism.com), an LLM-based dev platform to generate and iterate on full-stack web apps.
Here’s a demo video that goes from a comment on Twitter to a working app in 10 minutes: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TapOPO-Gv20.
Marblism started when we realized that much of the code we write for web apps is just slightly modified boilerplate: similar login flows, dashboards, API integrations, CRUD operations, etc. While AI tools are helpful, they fall short in delivering a well-architected codebase. The idea of Marblism is to combine the best of both worlds: a solid boilerplate, customized and enhanced with AI.
Here's how it works:
Generate your app -  Describe your product, and the AI will build your data model. We create a NextJS app with auth, custom CRUDs, permissions, payment, emails. The AI then generates your front-end pages.
Test and improve your app - Now that your app is set up, use our online workspace to test your app and add more complex features via an AI Chat or directly yourself in the VSCode editor.
Go live - Once you’re happy with your app, deploy it in production in one click.
Here are some examples of apps generated on Marblism in couple of hours of prompting:
Find and validate startup ideas: https://www.muckbrass.com/
A design system directory: https://awesomedesignsystem.app.io
AI-Personalized candle: https://www.scent-a-scene.com/
Marblism currently generates web apps like SaaS, marketplaces, and social networks. It doesn't support Chrome extensions or mobile apps, and it’s not really for small games like Snake/Tetris.
The vision is to add more tech stacks later this year and enable people to create their own templates/tech stack that the AI can customize.
We’re really excited to share this with you and we'd love to hear your thoughts on the potential directions we can take this product.

一方面是，心理上爱与别人比较，在学校时期自己也能卷。进入到大厂，发现比你能卷的、比你聪明的、家境比你好的大有人在，比来比去增加了好多焦虑。虽然理性告诉自己，与多年前的自己已经前进了很多，但是内心还是躁动不安，感觉见识了太多人和事。
另一方面是，对于未来越来越悲观，比如说上升通道狭窄，降本增效、没啥好新业务，只能苟着，社会的形势不好，感觉个人努力越来越没用，而个人努力又是我过去求学生涯最擅长的事情，有些迷茫了。
关于婚恋，还是自己目前暂有不错的收入，条件听着还马虎（小硕，收入还可，七七八八的爱好也不少），但是接触到的女生也越来越不是自己小镇做题家可以在一起的（比如最近暧昧的女生，才知道她家里几千 w 的资产，情不自禁让我有些退却），中秋回趟家发现和家的距离也变远了，但是在大城市飘着自己也不知道去哪儿
大佬们，有啥说的吗，感觉自己现在乱七八糟想法很多，生活缺失了主线，不像在学校那样没有想太多一直学就好，沉迷写代码感觉很有意思。]]></summary>

之前给 19 款的 mac 找了华强北技术扩容到了 64G RAM ，总有点食之无味弃之可惜的感觉。
这两天想看看有什么办法能“废物利用”一下。
我想到了一个大概的想法，当 NAS ，利用 ASM2464 芯片的硬盘盒，转接出 PCI-E 插槽，然后安装 RAID 直通卡，然后连接硬盘柜，用类似 SFF-8643 的线缆链接，然后 macOS 用虚拟机跑 TrueNas 、黑群晖、飞牛啥的都行
用 2464 主要是成本低，雷电 3 转 pcie 的盒子基本 1k 左右，自己用 2464 硬盘盒 DIY 基本 200 多搞定 PCIE 转接设备。
不知道大家还有没有什么好的点子，欢迎大家来点建议。]]></summary>

因为我们聊天都用地方方言，很少会用到普通话，因为是广东方言，听感其实和粤语，普通话都差十万八千里。
就在昨晚，9 月 16 号，基本每代 cod 都会玩的朋友实在无聊了下了个腾讯的 cod 手游(pc 版，现在的手游好像都流行多端互通），问我要不要一起玩。我晚一般到晚上都是有点精力不足，就没下载来玩，让朋友开了个共享屏幕我看着他玩，全程用方言在开玩笑调侃，除了几句用的普通话：
”什么？听说你也玩使命召唤？”
”00 后玩这 cod ，这辈子有了”
然后第二天我打开小红书，竟然有 cod 的推送，我是感觉非常神奇的。因为之前看 v2 老哥们说的，把小红书性别调成女，关闭个性化推送，确实是感觉到打开了另一个世界（给我推送擦边同城交友这些少了，取而代之的是各种甜品旅游攻略）。
然后晚上就刷到这毫无违和感的推送，莫名想笑。（因为今天中秋，回家了很少刷手机。祝 v 友们中秋快乐了！）

我和我朋友也不会在微信聊 cod ，除了监听麦克风，实在想不出为什么会这样推送。（我对 cod 兴趣也不大，今年都没在搜索引擎搜过任何相关的内容）
有没有大佬解答一下？]]></summary>

We were able to find customers, but none with compelling and overlapping use cases. Everyone who was interested was too early to be a real customer.
This was our launch: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36032081
We recently decided to revive and rebrand the project after seeing a sudden spike in interest from people who wanted to connect LLMs to data - but specifically through browsers. It's also a problem we've experienced firsthand, having built scraping features into Psychic and previously working on bot detection at Robinhood.
If you haven’t built a web scraper or browser automation before, you might assume it’s very straightforward. People have been building scrape…]]></summary>

        <id>https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41567192</id>
        <link href="https://github.com/comet-ml/opik"/>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey HN! I'm Caleb, one of the contributors to Opik, a new open source framework for LLM evaluations.
Over the last few months, my colleagues and I have been working on a project to solve what we see as the most painful parts of writing evals for an LLM application. For this initial release, we've focused on a few core features that we think are the most essential:
- Simplifying the implementation of more complex LLM-based evaluation metrics, like Hallucination and Moderation.
- Enabling step-by-step tracking, such that you can test and debug each individual component of your LLM application, even in more complex multi-agent architectures.
- Exposing an API for "model unit tests" (built on Pytest), to allow you to run evals as part of your CI/CD pipelines
- Providing an easy UI for scoring, annotating, and versioning your logged LLM data, for further evaluation or training.
It's often hard to feel like you can trust an LLM application in production, not just because of the stochastic nature of the model, but because of the opaqueness of the application itself. Our belief is that with better tooling for evaluations, we can meaningfully improve this situation, and unlock a new wave of LLM applications.
You can run Opik locally, or with a free API key via our cloud platform. You can use it with any model server or hosted model, but we currently have a built-in integration with the OpenAI Python library, which means it automatically works not just with OpenAI models, but with any model served via a compatible model server (ollama, vLLM, etc). Opik also currently has out-of-the-box integrations with LangChain, LlamaIndex, Ragas, and a few other popular tools.
This is our initial release of Opik, so if you have any feedback or questions, I'd love to hear them!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[最近在撸一些 tg 上的 miniapp ，其实就是嵌了 Telegram SDK 的 H5 网页。人少时勉强还能用，人数上百万时体验就不行了。虽然用户数多，但可能就是些草台班子搭建的，我甚至看到个直接挂在 github pages 上的。
用户体验（前端）
这一块应该不是瓶颈，但是胡乱“糊”的毫无体验可言。有用 react/next.js ，有用 vue/vuxt.js 的，动不动就重新 render 整个列表或页面。卡顿，白屏，无法交互等，不知道做了什么导致 cpu 飙高设备发热
CDN 与缓存，HTTP2 or HTTP3
错误上报，反馈。内部测试没几个人，一旦数量级上百万了，错误率也可能放大 n 倍。没有这一环开发者根本不知道会出现什么 bug
可靠性（后端）
经常看到一些网络错误，通常是 500 ，导致 502/504 网关之类的
数据库/服务器负载能力。备用？或者创建集群？
API 请求量，接口防刷。有些或许能在边缘节点运算？]]></summary>

一、AI 软件对系统版本有要求，比如 Chatgpt 需要 16.4 以上，Claude 需要 17 以上（目前只能安装 Copliot 和 Gemini ）；
二、日本 POVO 电话卡支持海外数据漫游，在中国大陆使用的联通 5G ，但必须要求 IOS17.0 以上；
三、英国 Giffgaff 卡开始支持 Wi-Fi Calling ，但要求 IOS17.4 以上（我的美国 TMobile 卡就没有这样的要求）
所以我有两个疑问，是什么决定了一个 APP/功能所需的最低系统版本？
有哪些已知的 APP/功能，是必须在 IOS18 及以上才能使用的？

 However older distros like: an ancient version of Ubuntu or even modern day Slackware use a different screen, the one that goes Press F1 for help or enter to boot Where you can pick different kernels or options or memtest86 idk ¯⁠\⁠_⁠(⁠ツ⁠)⁠_⁠/⁠¯ Or even opensuse which has a more complex boot screen that loads the kernel in what looks like a different fashion and has many options 
 What are the names or these pieces of software? I suspect one of the two might be Lilo and I'm just too young but the others?

 Then when I was asked to configure thunderbird, the thunderbird terminal glitched and stopped responding and the update program wont even notice that its glitching....
 Then I had to restart in the middle of the upgrade then when I finally restarted, it couldnt even boot. 
 I had to backup everything and reinstall ubuntu 24.01 LTS, and I failed to backup everything completely because it was too big. I lost almost all my data. 
 I thought of starting over in a new distribution. But ubuntu 24.01 LTS is awful: It was slow, programs were glitching, the new interface really makes it weird. 
 I then downgraded back to 22.01 LTS and of course, I lost all my data again because ubuntu doesnt retain the home folder when you install a new distribution....
 It all started from a simple harmless prompt.

 You taught me to fix SSD compatibility issues, how a filesystem works, how to make GRUB look pretty, and how not to fix a root folder issue (worked my system)
 But now, as I'm forced into using tools I hate by my university, I must say goodbye. Alas, the power of free software isn't anything to the power of the Spanish University System.
 Goodbye Linux, and I'll come back once my odyssey in Law ends.

 Edit: LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, I managed to get it working with a Win10 VM, somehow. I had tried before and it didn't work but now It did. Arcane magic, I don't know. In conclusion, I will still be using Linux. Long live free and open source software!

综合来说 AirPods 4 的降噪性能似乎评价颇高，体积和外观，以及充电盒之余 AirPods 3 变化颇大，但是可能是为了给 Pro 制造卖点，人为去掉了滑动触碰控制音量，人体感应检测和 MagSafe 磁铁。
另外在售价上几乎是维持了 AirPods 3 发布时的价格，但是功能和规格上大部分都超出了 AirPods 3 。
最后就是 4 代的普通版的价格依然跟一代对齐，但是确有全方位的提升，相信一代二代的钉子户应该能接受这次的升级。

前言
之前折腾了使用 Docker 在 NAS 里部署桌面版 AnyType 客户端，用来局域网同步数据。
但是我还是不死心，还是想试试部署官方的同步服务。于是又研究了一天，得出了这个新的方案。
分析官方 docker 结构
官方是有着一个github 仓库用来部署 docker 的。
配置很复杂，而且一些服务的设置有些迷惑，类似redis，mongo，minio之类的服务其实都没必要把端口映射出来，一些官方的镜像也完全没有必要用Dockerfile自己编译，直接用官方的镜像就行。
于是我就想能不能把他的镜像优化一下，所以先看看他的镜像都有什么。
源文件: https://github.com/anyproto/any-sync-dockercompose/blob/main/docker-compose.yml
根据源文件的 service 字段，从上到下的服务一共有这些。
generateconfig-anyconf
generateconfig-processing
mongo-1
redis
minio
create-bucket
any-sync-coordinator_bootstrap
any-sync-coordinator
any-sync-filenode
any-sync-node-1
any-sync-node-2
any-sync-node-3
any-sync-consensusnode
netcheck
generateconfig-anyconf是用于创建配置的。
generateconfig-processing是用来判断配置是否创建完成的。
any-sync-coordinator_bootstrap也是用来判断配置是否正确的。
netcheck是检测配置和网络是否正确…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[帮我的一个程序员朋友问个问题，他自己独立开发了一个小众领域的 PC 端软件（非安卓，非苹果 App ），主要在专业领域内销售，客户 99.9%在国外，单价几十美元，目前此软件一年收入几万刀吧。
主要交易方式就是让对方汇款到银行账户，然后激活 软件。当然试过信用卡收款，如果客户来自欧美还好，信用卡收款比较顺利，但是当客户来自东南亚或南美时候等欠发达地区时，信用卡收款经常出现各种莫名其妙的问题，比较扯皮。
前几天想改成 paypal 收款，发现 paypal 也有很多坑，账户容易被封，手续费高，汇率太坑。请问各位前辈大佬，除了转账，信用卡，paypal ，目前还有什么靠谱的国际收款方式吗？加密币就算了，这东西太小众，人家不会因为想买你软件还专门开了加密币账户。
转账（效率低，手续麻烦）
信用卡（发展中国家，东南亚，南美地区经常出问题）
paypal （坑多，封号，手续费高，汇率问题）
还请有经验的 老哥指教下，哪种收款方式靠谱，先谢过了！]]></summary>

好像也没大家说得那么好用，至少我个人用下来觉得一般。
本身就一堆小问题
这是我上手这个浏览器仅仅一天就觉得不适应的地方，排名不分先后。
本地化
界面无中文，桌面端没有，移动端也没有，简体中文没有，繁体中文也没有。很难想象这是一个从 2022 年 4 月 19 日发布至今的产品。硬要说一点也没有那倒也不是，网页的右键菜单是中文，arc://settings/页面有中文，但是又没翻译全，仍然有部分英文。
同步数据需要科学上网，这点很麻烦。你可能会说：“那 Chrome 也需要啊”，你说的对，而且不止 Chrome ，Vivaldi 现在也需要……但是它们与 Arc 不同的地方在于，当它们使用扩展程序来接管浏览器的代理时，它们就可以通过扩展程序代理的网络来进行数据同步，但是 Arc 就不行，它一定要是 TUN 模式这种接管系统流量的方案才能进行同步。
体验感撕裂
当你打开浏览器的「偏好设置」（也就是 Preferences ）时，Arc 会弹出一个窗口，你可以在其中进行部分主要设定，但是当你点击「 Advanced 」标签，然后点击「 More Settings…」按钮时，Arc 就会打开 Chromium 原生的设置页面，这种体验上的割裂感让我十分不适。我觉得你要么就直接把所有设置项都放到你自己创建的窗口里，不然你就直接把 Chromium 原生的设置界面搬过来用也不会有人说什么，做了一半剩一半你不如不做呢？
喜欢吗？喜欢就砍了！
Note 功能到哪去了？从这支影片 Arc 真香！腦洞大開的功能讓超多 Chrome 死忠粉決定把 Arc 當作預設瀏覽器了！ 的 9:57 处可以看到，当你点击侧边栏下方的 + 号时可以在弹出的菜单中看到「 New Note 」这个选项，通过点击它你可以创建一个笔记。但是我现在在使用时却没有这…]]></summary>

补充：重启发生前，没有进行过任何玩机操作。只有 fastboot 可用，其余模式都要归于重启的命运。无限重启会卡在第一屏，也就是 Google 六个字母，大概会停留 1 分钟左右，然后再次重启。]]></summary>

 Is there a country where the students are brought up on Linux computers and FOSS? I strongly believe that people don't quit habits without reason, so setting kids up with a Microsoft account from day 1 seems like a pretty bad idea from an open source perspective. The creative kids will end up with Macbooks and using google products but how can we get the kids just comfortable using Linux from early?
 Teach them about Qubes and Arch later...

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've been learning about the L4 microkernel, and am thinking about doing something related to it for a research project.  I'm especially curious about more recent examples of specific devices that run L4 variants (seL4, PikeOS, OKL4, etc.).  I already found a few that use seL4, but to take OKL4 as an example, most of the specific devices I could find are from more than a decade ago, and I'm trying to find things from at least the last 5 or 6 years.  I'm even more curious to find devices that use a form of L4 as a hypervisor.
Has anyone here worked on a device that used an L4-related kernel or hypervisor?  I know one major area they're used in is defense and full of NDAs, but hopefully some of the other industries they're used in (medical devices, automotive, IoT) are a little less restrictive.  Thanks in advance!

被裁一个月，在持续的感受自由，也在重塑自己的生活。回想上班几年，匆匆而已，忽地觉得那几年过的如重复同一天一样，打卡，做一些无意义的工作，等周末了，在 20km 范围内游玩一下，重复而麻了的感觉。
前半个月，还是会担心一些没有进账的情况。但是经过这一个月的思考，我的心态坚定下来，不去着急挣钱，做自己认为是正确的事情，哪怕那个东西短期没有收益，先去探索，去扩大自己的视野。
这一个月，定下了三个小项目的方向，代码也写了一部分，这些项目会不会产生收益，多久产生，不得而知，继续用爱发电，做自己爱做的事情。]]></summary>

What is it worth to know the weather forecast 1 day earlier? That’s not a hypothetical question, traditional forecasting systems have been improving their skill at a rate of 1 day per decade. In other words, today’s 6-day forecast is as accurate as the 5-day forecast ten years ago. No one expects this rate of improvement to hold steady, it has to slow down eventually, right? Well in the last couple years GPUs and modern deep learning have actually sped it up.

这些都是偶尔但是很容易复现的事情，实在是想不通啥原因。这事和内存应该没关系吧，但我想换一下排除下看看。也有可能就是键盘和鼠标的问题。]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[FTTR 设备发热实在是太过于严重了，后台中兴智家显示不到 50 度，隔三差五的就重启，昨天晚上直接重启了 5 次。直到我插了一个 USB 风扇，才未重启，可是风扇外置，温度根本压不下去，保持在 42 度左右。一旦我断电，他就又开始重启了，网络体验实在是糟糕。
目前 FTTR 业务，还有两年半的合约未到期，违约金 600 元。个人觉得这台设备不如 100 元装机费的普通联通千兆光猫。
这个设备仅有一年的厂家保修，估计也坏不掉，就是软件方面的配置，太差劲了。
100 元的普通千兆光猫都支持每天断电重启，这个 399 元装机费的 FTTR 设备却不支持。
399 元装机费的设备，这个光衰的控制也差劲，-28db 的光，设备都上线不了，100 元装机费的设备，-35 的光，照样在那里刷抖音。
目前使用了一台 AMD 幽灵散热器，可以温度控制在 35 度。十分稳定，可是盖子扣不上，幽灵散热器铝板，摆在上边，不知用什么方式固定起来，只是只能只能反面朝上放，也比较担心积灰。
V 友们有什么解决办法吗？]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[2024 ，0909-0915
这个周记的标题一改再改，因为被拒的次数不断增加。
Google Play 账户验证
这周一次性通过了 Google Play 的身份验证和银行账户验证。
之前听闻有的开发者卡在这里好久，提交各种资料就是不能通过。我也害怕这种事发生在我身上，好在没有。就是按照要求提交了身份证、水电费和银行流水，就直接通过验证了。

虽然来自 GP 的收入一直在下降，但是也是目前收入的重要组成的一部分，占到美元收入的差不多四成左右。
上周有人留言要买我的账号的 App ，向群友请教了一番，结果并不能卖多少钱，连一两特斯拉 Model Y 都不够。算了，还是别杀鸡取卵了。
Shipaton 第五周
距离截止日期还剩 3 天。
第五周生产力大爆发，一共完成了 56 个番茄钟，是最多的一周！

因为马上就要到 deadline 了，为了能够顺利提交 App ，不得不又砍掉了一个 Jar Type 。剩余的工作就是 UI 调整，修复 bug ，加入动画和声效以提高交互性。设计师列了几十个 UI 调整事项，还好我很快就完成了大部分，一天发四五个 TestFlight 的 build ，只剩几项我认为比较费时就先搁置了。
https://youtu.be/F12HzTVRrT0
连续被拒 6 次
终于，周五下午四点提交了第一版，没想到过了 30 个小时才进入审核。整个周六的精神状态都是心不在焉的，什么都干不进去，总在期待收到审核结果的邮件，然后意料之中地被拒了。第一次被拒的原因还好，只是元数据的问题，填补后顺便修复了一个小组件的问题第二次提交（周六晚上）。
在等待审核的间隙，完善了 Ship-A-Ton 的各种资料，还第一次用 Rotato 录了一个演示视频。
https://youtu.be/IRKSo2Txclc
然而，第二次被拒就是周日下午了，直到午夜连着拒绝了五次……

第二次被拒的原因：Paywall 页面里缺少付费后用户得到的功能或服务（我选择的这个 Revenue Cat Paywall 模板没有关于付费解锁内容的配置）。
第三次和第四次被拒都是同样的原因：说是 Paywall 页面无法加载，影响用户付费体验。但我这个 Paywall 是 RevenueCat 提供的，加载过程不由我控制，RC 的建议就是如果一切配置没问题的话，那就是苹果审核环境导致的，没有其他办法，只能是一遍遍的重复提交。
第五次被拒的原因：页面存在难以阅读的文字。其实就是 Onboarding 部分的大段文字颜色有些浅，而且在小屏幕的手机上会显示不全。
第六次被拒的原因有三个：
付费页面的按钮文案不符合要求，而我这还是借鉴了 Mobbin 发布的关于提高付费转化率的最佳实践。
付费后遇到错误，我猜是因为 App 销售范围和订阅的销售范围不一致导致的，因为我还没有时间备案，所以第一版就不打算在国内上架了。虽然 App 销售范围去掉了中国大陆，但是订阅的销售范围还是所有国家和地区，这里不一致，另外我也回复给审核人员说这个 App 不在中国大陆销售，请用其他国家的配置环境来审核。
技术支持 URL 留的网址不符合要求，我本以为用 Notion 搭一个包含隐私政策和使用协议的简单页面就可以了，但是苹果说必须要是能和开发者直接联系的网站才行。
第七次提交后就马上是午夜十二点了，心情已经麻木和崩溃了，十分沮丧和忐忑地入睡了。我还梦见了第七次被拒，审核员还给我发了一封巨长巨长的邮件，里面罗列了各种素材和命名的截图，说我的 App 抄袭黑神话·悟空……
还好，没有第七次被拒，一觉醒来，审核通过了！
我偏要贪图完满，搜个干净
黑神话·悟空，二周目，白金达成。
这游戏白金的达成，不是能力问题，也不是时间问题，而是运气问题。
花了两天在收集各种概率掉落的物品上，感觉我人品还不错，并没有刷到崩溃就收集全了，不过就凭这一点也应该给这个游戏减 0.1 分。]]></summary>

The unusual thing with my version is, it is in pure Node.js, with the power of node-mlx, a Node.js machine learning framework.
The repo in the link is mostly about implementing indexing and CLI, the code of the model implementation lives as a Node.js module: https://github.com/frost-beta/clip .

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[其实扫码枪、条码枪都是一种 HID 设备，读取的原理就是监听键盘输入，因为之前我写过一个网页，通过监听 keypress 实现过，项目运行了一年不到，这次又来了个新需求，就是需要处于非活跃状态录入，如果不是活跃标签页，就无法监听，串口 API 其实也能用，不过已有的扫码枪不一定都能读串口，所以前端也不好做。 
我所写的这个桌面端程序就是用来解决这一痛点的，打开后图标会显示到 Windows 托盘上后台运行，将条码枪输入的内容转发到指定后端接口上。
后端可以通过 http 转发的结果进行处理，纯前端可以通过 WebSocket 连接然后处理。 
目前用了 2 周没问题，测试了火绒，Windows Defender 不报毒，使用的 Golang, 构建的 exe 文件体积大概 10MB 左右，可以自己编译，支持 Windows 7 以上环境运行。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[⚠️ 该方案仅适用 Mac 平台，且需要安装 hammerspoon
该脚本主要是为了解决无极滚轮容易回滚的问题，我的测试鼠标为罗技 Anywhere3s ，鼠标滚轮为 magspeed 电磁滚轮，Anywhere 2 代物理结构的滚轮也应该支持，其他系列，例如：Master 系列也应该支持
回滚场景
开启无极滚动，或者 Logi Options+ 中开启了平滑滚动
即使使用棘轮模式（刻度模式），当手指放到滚轮上，也有概率会触发回滚
原因分析
由于开启了平滑滚动，滚轮任何细粒度的滚动都会触发事件，
这种情况下棘轮单纯是为了手感，棘轮刻度的粒度并不严格对应事件粒度，
很可能棘轮刻度感还没触发，事件已经发射了好几次
处理方案
简单来说，当鼠标滚轮事件触发时，判断一下滚动方向是不是发生了变化，
只有在同一个方向上滚动到一定次数后，才认为是真的发生了预期滚动
脚本地址如下：

I've made a javascript library to simplify searching/sorting/filtering in arrays of objects. Its inspired by both GraphQL and SQL, but implemented using javascript Proxies. Instead of creating a new language, its all just javascript.
I've made it as part of an experimental database, which uses javascript as the query engine. The normal javascript map/reduce/sort functions are quite difficult to master for junior developers. JAQT is easier to explain, and can still be used in combination with any existing array functions.
Please let me know what you think of the API and its ease of use!

Polymarket 的创始人，今年 26 岁的 Shayne Coplan 让我非常感兴趣：
Shayne Coplan 今年 26 岁，但却拥有了 12 年的加密领域经验：
他 14 岁时接触到加密货币，和朋友用矿机挖莱特币；
16 岁时参与了以太坊预售，是当年最年轻的参与者之一
18 岁进入纽约大学，第二学期就退学。3 年后创办了 Polymarket, 目前已经成长为最大的预测市场，甚至影响美国大选。
作为一名内容创作者、加密爱好者和父亲，我不禁好奇：
Shayne Coplan 的成长环境是什么样？
Shayne Coplan 的成长过程中被哪些事物所影响，让其 14 岁接触到加密、16 岁参与以太坊预售、22 岁创办 Polymarket?
有哪些部分是我们培养下一代 / 未来企业家时可以参考的？

于是我搜集了和 Shayne Coplan 相关的所有采访，找到一些蛛丝马迹，形成了一篇 7000 字的文章，欢迎阅读和分享： https://www.web3brand.io/p/polymarket-shayne-coplan
另外因为是人物故事的形式，这篇文章同样适合收听，于是我同时制作了一份有声版，同样欢迎收听，enjoy： https://www.xiaoyuzhoufm.com/episode/66e521835ca6d0ace3e0fd22]]></summary>

在很久之前，我都是通过浏览器书签来达到这个目的的。后来由于有的是图片、视频等，用浏览器书签不太方便，后来我通过 QQ 群来达到这一目的。但是 QQ 群有个弊端，就是聊天记录时间长了会丢失掉。所以最后我的方案是使用 Telegram 的「 Save message 」这个功能。
Telegram 的「 Save message 」这个功能目前还挺好用的，就是有点不太好管理，一是没有一个基本的分类（我都是使用 tag 的方式来达到分类的目的），二是整体这还是一个以一个消息的方式进行保存，后面要找某个信息，还是过于依赖搜索了。
大家可有推荐的工具？
可以收藏任何类型的信息，例如，链接、图片、视频、文件等等
不要是 notion 、obsidian 那种笔记类型的，太重了，太麻烦了。
我现在的设想是通过 telegram 群组 + bot 的方式来实现，用 tg 来做收藏确实方便，在通过 bot 来进行管理，只是我不确定是否能做到一个群组只有自己能够访问，其他任何人不能访问，防止别人进去群组看到我的信息，我 tg 使用得挺久了，但是对这方面确实不了解，有知道的朋友吗？]]></summary>

从做项目开始基本是啥也不会，用过若依和芋道两个框架边做边学，做的都是电商类的项目。
前段时间没什么需求了，项目也不怎么需要维护，然后自己看了本设计模式的书，并用状态模式重新设计了核价模块。
现在很迷茫，不知道学什么中间件。之前自学了 python 由于没有应用场景也忘的差不多了，自学了 go 语言也就写了一个爬虫脚本也忘的差不多了。其他的一些中间件也是因为没有应用场景基本上学完就忘，顶多知道这些概念，以后遇到某些场景用该技术实现会更好。
求各位大佬帮小弟分析一下折腾一些什么东西比较好。]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm currently investigating how to support wayland with nvidia graphics through optimus-manager (https://github.com/Askannz/optimus-manager).
 I think I figured out an initial way, and I was wondering if this will work for you too.
 The method goes like this:
 Create /etc/profile.d/optimus-manager.sh with the following content:
 ```
 ! /bin/sh
 if [[ "${XDG_SESSION_TYPE}" == "wayland" ]]; then export __GLX_VENDOR_LIBRARY_NAME=nvidia export __VK_LAYER_NV_optimus=NVIDIA_only fi ```
 Then restart, and run a native game to see if it works.
 With "The Dark Mod" (https://www.thedarkmod.com/) the difference is quite noticeable.
 The desktop shall report that it is using the integrated GPU for its rendering, but it will be using the dedicated GPU for GLX and Vulkan rendering.

__package__: 当前代码所在包路径, 无类型字符串常量
__FILE__: 当前代码所在文件名, 无类型字符串常量
__LINE__: 当前代码所在文件的行号, 无类型整数常量
__func__: 当前代码所在的具名函数或方法名字, 无类型字符串常量
可以这样打印源码位置信息:
func main {

	println("__FILE__:", __FILE__)
	println("__LINE__:", __LINE__)
	println("__func__:", __func__)
}

执行效果如下:

 While definitely a niece area there is definitely people out there that want this use case (ahem me), and unfortunately the market is pretty bad (until now ?). I wrote this tool which allows you to create a virtual linux device for any of your androids kernel devices.
 Though apart from using android tablet as wacom like external tablet, I can't find any other use cases (maybe you have one ?). Other than useless but kinda cool things like being able to detect when your headphone jack is unplugged, or use your phones touch screen on your linux machine.
 The ux is in need of tlc but I wanted to post about this as I would love for people to test out there own devices. Also its MIT so have at it!

帖子里说“原来阿里云盘在服务端是不加密的”然后一堆人附和，说加密就不能秒传。看来大家对加密的概念还很生疏。
对阿里云不熟，就拿 aws 的 s3 来说吧。s3 默认对于每个文件都是服务端加密的，而且是每个文件一个密码。但即使是这样，也不影响设计秒传，不影响一个用户看到他人的文件。
所谓 server 端加密，是指［文件不会明文写到磁盘上］。在上传时用随机密钥加密文件，随机密钥再用预先配置的非对称密钥加密，然后将随机密钥加密后的文件、非对称加密后的随机密钥分别存储在 aws 中。在下载时，aws 会先解析成明文，然后使用 https 传输到用户/业务服务器。所以无论谁去下载你的文件，aws 都会给他解密后的版本。
至于秒传，是第一次上传时保存整体的哈希，以及每一个文件块的哈希，类似 bt 种子。再次上传时，用户本地生成一个新的哈希，服务端一看，在我的 redis 里面已经有这个种子了你就秒传了，跟文件存储一点关系都没有。
如果你希望服务器不能看你的文件，那要做的是客户端加密，也就是文件已经加密好上传到服务器，服务器根本不知道如何解密当然也就没法生成缩略图或者秒传了。
所谓服务端加密指的是静态加密，写盘时加密。再严格一点给你加个内网传输加密，也就是在内网的 http 和数据库连接什么的给用 tls 保护一下。数据在内存里可都是明文。]]></summary>

原生库需要重新编译，可能需要修改代码以支持动态页大小，代码段需要 16K 对齐
16K 页表只能全局启用，不允许 4K 页应用与 16K 页应用混合运行，因为 Linux 不支持
只有高版本 NDK 和 AGP 支持，老版 NDK 不一定能通过改链接选项实现兼容
考虑下收益，感觉完全看不到能推下去的可能性，哪怕有是 Play 市场来推，要求升级 NDK 可比升级 Target 难多了。]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[近日，有媒体报道称，某消费者安装在卧室的小米摄像头突然有陌生男子说话。9月13日，小米公司发言人在官方微博发布声明称，关注到网友对小米智能摄像机2云台版的有关疑问，经查实，相关视频中出现的产品，根据用户提供的访问记录截图信息，对应时段无人访问。“经沟通，我们已经征求用户同意，取回设备并进行检测，目前设备状态一切正常。后续我们会再次进行检测，同时也邀请第三方鉴定机构对该产品进行鉴定测试，确保公众对安全保障的知情权。”


小米方面称，该型号摄像机固件有声音回声消除功能（AEC），摄像机扬声器发出的声音被摄像机麦克风采集后会被回声消除算法过滤掉，所以摄像机与手机对讲过程中不会把摄像机扬声器播放的声音录制存储。如果是本机发出的声音，也不会被回放监测视频录制。


同时，小米方面还强调，该款摄像机及相关网络服务未被网络攻击，任何未经授权的个人或设备均无法与该摄像机进行语音对话。与该摄像机语音对话的唯一方式是，通过米家App与摄像机建立的实时端到端加密通信通道进行，加密通道使用一次一密机制，并采用行业标准加密算法。


以下为小米回应全文：



我们关注到网友对小米智能摄像机 2 云台版的有关疑问，经查实，我们声明如下：


1、相关视频中出现的产品，根据用户提供的访问记录截图信息显示，对应时段无人访问。


2、该型号摄像机固件有声音回声消除功能（AEC），摄像机扬声器发出的声音被摄像机麦克风采集后会被回声消除算法过滤掉，所以摄像机与手机对讲过程中，不会把摄像机扬声器播放的声音录制存储。如果是本机发出的声音，也不会被回放监测视频录制。

4、经沟通，我们已经征求用户同意，取回设备并进行检测，目前设备状态一切正常，后续我们会再次进行检测。同时也邀请第三方鉴定机构对该产品进行鉴定测试，确保公众对安全保障的知情权。


我们高度重视用户安全隐私保护。小米智能摄像机严格按照国家相关标准和小米《消费级物联网安全基线》要求设计开发，遵循小米产品安全开发流程，产品在需求设计、功能开发各阶段均经过安全评估和渗透测试，确保提前识别安全风险并进行处置，将产品安全放心地交给用户。小米安全中心持续对已销售产品安全防护机制进行验证，保障小米产品安全防护水平持续有效，感谢广大网友和媒体的关注。]]></summary>

最近用 VSCode 总是是不是卡一下，有点烦，所以原本是想要换一台电脑的，但是今天编译 Linux 内核的时候发现一套下来也就 40min 左右（肯定不是全部模块都启用，Arch 默认 config 基础上加上几个 HID 的一些子模块）。然后回过来一想，编译内核也就 40min ，至少这个性能我还是能接收的——虽然不算多牛比，但是我已经满足了，没必要给自己制造性能焦虑。
最重要的是我发现在 CPU 占用率 100% 的这段时间做其他事情基本没有受影响，这体验就很舒服。所以，虽然它已经跟不上主流笔记本的性能，但是对我来说已经够了，至少是一个我能满足的性能。至于 VSCode 偶尔卡吨一下的问题一来稍微忍一忍也未尝不可，而来自己本来也就在往 neovim 上迁移，只是一直没有断舍干净。
也许还能再战三年？]]></summary>

接上一个帖子（[https://www.v2ex.com/t/1073068]），请教了大家如何减少暴漏 NAS 的端口，建议比较多的是使用 WireGuard ，遂尝试部署了下，踩了好多坑，终于调通，跟大家分享一下经历
我的设备情况：
NAS：群晖 1821+ ，DSM 7.2.1-69057 Update 5 ，内网 IP 是 192.168.1.2；
WireGuard 服务端：wg-easy/wg-easy v14.0.0 ；
手机：iPhone 15 ，iOS 17.6 (21G80)；
WireGuard 客户端：Loon 3.2.2 (749)；
有动态公网 IPv4 地址，有一个域名 example.com，通过 DDNS 把公网 IPv4 地址绑定到云服务商，NAS 上安装了泛域名证书。
在这个实例中，域名、端口号、密码等均为虚构，请根据你的需要修改。
一、在 NAS 安装部署 WireGuard
1. 解决内核版本过低问题
WireGuard 要求 Linux 内核版本高于 5.6 ，但是群晖不满足这个要求，在 NAS 终端执行 uname -r 后看到 4.4.302+
办法是安装第三方套件源，套件中心 → 设置  →  添加： https://spk7.imnks.com/
进入社群，搜索 WireGuard 下载，在 NAS 终端执行 sudo sed -i 's/package/root/g' /var/packages/WireGuard/conf/privilege 修复权限问题。
2. 通过 Container Manager 构建 WireGuardEasy
2.1. 新建目录 docker/WireGuardEasy，docker/WireGuardEasy/config；
2.2. 新建 compose.yml 文件，上传到…]]></summary>

Q: Why everything tastes like chicken?
A: Because "everything tastes like chicken" tastes like chicken.
Proof:
"Everything tastes like chicken" is a set. S = {x | x tastes like chicken}
This particular set ("everything tastes like chicken") contains itself because the set itself is an element of "everything".
Since "everything tastes like chicken" (as described), "everything", including this set, has to taste like chicken.
Hence, "everything tastes like chicken."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[One of the big things I see keeping people from using Linux as their only desktop OS is the unavailability of Photoshop (and other Adobe Products) on Linux. Now granted, I don't really know anything about photo editing or graphic design but based on what I read from people who do graphic design professionally, GIMP just isn't up to snuff as far as features and workflow even with the new 3.0 coming. 
 I learned about Photopea a couple years ago and it looks a much better alternative to Photoshop as far as workflow and features (CMYK, smart objects, AI features). The issue I see people might have it with it is it being web based and proprietary though it does edit your photos offline and is big on privacy.
 With all this in mind, for graphic design people wanting to switch to Linux should we be steering them more towards Photopea rather than GIMP despite it being proprietary and web based?
 Keep in mind I ask this as someone who knows next to nothing about graphic design or photo editing, just a huge Linux enthusiast so I would be very interested to hear thoughts from people who know more than me and/or have used both Photoshop and Photopea.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[帮我的一个程序员朋友问个问题，他自己独立开发了一个小众领域的 pc 端软件，主要在专业领域内销售，单价几十刀，目前此软件一年收入几万刀吧，刚够下馆子，打牙祭。
他的另一个独立软件就快开发好了，预计软件销售情况会更好些，打算换一个银行帐号链接 paypal ，以规避日益严峻的风险，前阵子不是有个承德程序员辛辛苦苦好几年的收入被吞了么（ https://www.sohu.com/a/732098677_121124373 ），当然，规避风险要在合理合法范围内操作，就像有一些公司跑香港，开曼群岛注册一样。
目前这位程序员朋友打算从以下几个地方选择开户银行：
1 香港某丰银行 （去香港比较方便）
2 新加坡的当地银行 （目前还不需要签证）
3 美国的银行 （可能比较麻烦，只能趁出差时候去）
他想打听下， 哪里的银行账户维持费用最低？哪里的银行账户在合理合法范围内所要交的税最少？比如如果在香港银行开户的话，平时吃穿用度还是在国内，软件销售收款后，需要从香港账户转到国内账户消费（一年软件销售额也就几万美元），如此操作不知有没有坑？
大家也看到了，软件销售金额很小，属小本经营，大家莫笑，之所以精打细算，只是不想让自己的一点秃头掉毛辛苦钱打了水漂...
还请有经验的前辈老哥指教下，替我的那位程序员朋友先谢过了！]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[很多软件的桌面端都使用 Electron ，但我搜了很久，却几乎没人提到他们的手机端是用什么开发的。Electron 是基于 Chromium 和 node.js 的，这俩玩意至少也能在安卓运行，为何却不支持手机端呢。
例如 NTQQ 号称大一统，我估摸着意思应该是开放环境是统一的？或者当中用到的类、库是统一的？或者干脆就是一个项目？
翻阅了很久，网页技术跨平台基本上都推荐 Electron ，好吧我也认同毕竟用的软件太多了，但是！移动端都用什么呢？毕竟主流软件都是有桌面端和手机端的，但大家似乎都闭口不言了（就像有什么隐秘，大家默契的选择了不告诉别人）。
我想问的是，桌面端跨平台用 Electron 已经够了，但桌面已经写了一套，没理由不把各种代码共享给手机端吧，这样手机端开发起来就不会有什么差异了（逻辑、数据）。
所以如何在有了 Electron 桌面端项目，尽可能用这套代码去开发手机端（移动端）呢？国内这么多软件，大家普遍采用什么方案呢？
这里不聊全平台跨平台(已经看到了大部分人会推荐 Flutter)，这里只聊 Electron 的移动端解决方案。]]></summary>

 I'm wondering why not many people know about Opensuse Leap yet? The system is legit solid, works out of the box it's GREAT for beginners, the community repo is full of software to install.
 It's twice as fast as Ubuntu on my machine, and it feels so rock stable!
 Why aren't people aware of it yet? It's time to change it, give Opensuse a try, it's just fantastic!
 Edit: LEap is on life support so Thumbleweed is a good bet too: https://en.opensuse.org/Lifetime

        <link href="https://www.v2ex.com/t/1073219#reply8"/>
        <updated>2024-09-15T08:46:19.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[一）关于是不是足够的爱自己
1 ）自我接纳：接受自己的优点和缺点。每个人都有不完美的地方，学会接纳自己的不足，才能更好地提升自己。
我渐渐认识到自己的优点和缺点，缺点多，优点少，但没有发扬自己的优点
2 ）设定界限：学会说“不”，保护自己的时间和精力。不要让别人的需求无限制地侵占你，设立清晰的界限，让自己有足够的空间休息和成长。
==
有时候可以说不，有的时候没有说不
3 ）照顾身体：保持健康的生活方式，如均衡饮食、定期锻炼和充足的睡眠。这不仅有助于你的身体健康，也能提升情绪和心理状态。
除了熬夜，比较喜欢吃面包，蛋糕，饮食运动方面做的比较好
4 ）情感护理：学会与自己对话，表达内心的感受。可以通过写日记、冥想或与可信赖的人交流来处理和释放情绪，保持心灵的平衡。
==
有在学习和自己对话，没什么固定的人可以释放和处理自己的情绪了
培养兴趣爱好：做你喜欢的事，培养能够带来内心喜悦的爱好和活动。无论是阅读、绘画、旅行，还是学习新的知识，这些都能丰富你的生活，增强对自己的爱与尊重。
5 ）提升自我价值：不断学习和提升技能，增强自我认同感。学习让你感到有价值的知识和能力，会提升自信和对自我的认可。
有在学习和提升自己的技能，但没什么自我认同
6 ）保持正面的人际关系：远离消耗你能量的人，倾向于与那些尊重你、支持你成长的朋友交往，建立积极的关系网络。
==
没什么正面的人际关系，全是消耗我能量的人
7 ）感恩与积极思维：培养感恩的心态，关注生活中的积极面。积极的思维方式能帮助你在面对挑战时保持心态平衡，从而更好地处理压力和困难。
没什么积极的思维方式，大部分心态是悲观，消极的
8 ）适当休息与放松：给予自己放松和休息的时间，避免过度劳累和压力过大。休息是为了更好地前行，给自己喘息的空间也是爱自己的一部分。
我也不知道自己压力是不是过大
9 ）设定目标并庆祝成就：为自己设定合理的目标，无论大小，当你完成时，学会庆祝自己的每一个进步，这能给你带来自信与满足感。
我没什么目标，没什么可以值得庆祝的
二）
对自己不感兴趣通常指的是一种缺乏自我关注和自我认同的状态。它表现为对自身的需求、感受、兴趣、能力以及生活目标没有足够的关心和投入。这种状态下，人可能会对自己的内心世界漠不关心，甚至觉得自己的存在没有太多意义，导致情感上的冷漠或自我忽视。以下是几种常见的表现：
忽视自己的需求：对自己的情感、身体或心理需求缺乏关注，常常优先考虑别人的需求，而忽视自己的感受和健康。
缺乏自我认同：对自己的价值和身份感到模糊，可能不知道自己真正喜欢什么或适合什么，导致迷失方向或缺乏生活动力。
无兴趣探索自我：对自我成长、学习新事物、发展兴趣爱好或提升个人技能缺乏兴趣和热情，生活中没有追求和目标感。
自我忽视或否定：对自己的能力或成就不自信，经常贬低自己，觉得自己不值得关注或不够好。
情感疏离：与自己内心的感受脱节，不愿意或不擅长处理情绪，选择忽视或压抑情感，而不是面对它们。
生活缺乏激情：生活中没有让自己感到满足和兴奋的事物，日常生活可能变得机械化，对未来没有明确的期待或规划。
如果一个人对自己不感兴趣，通常会感到情绪低落、缺乏活力，甚至会出现抑郁的迹象。要改变这种状态，关键是重新找到与自我的连接，关注自身的感受、需求和兴趣，通过探索和学习发现更多的自我价值。
==
有人说我不够爱自己，对自己没什么兴趣，后来我查了一下，确实有这样的问题]]></summary>

WaifuBoost 是一个可以离线放大图片的 APP ，目前对动漫图片放大效果较好，我希望将它发布到 Google Play 上，但是现在 Google Play 上架需要 20 人连续 14 天的测试，所以希望找大家帮帮忙。

你可以用它修复模糊的动漫图片，并且不需要网络。
如何完成测试
因为谷歌封闭测试是邀请制度的，因此我需要你的 Google 邮箱，这样当我拉你进入测试后即可下载测试了！遇到 APP 的真实问题也欢迎留言。
测试地址：
点击填写 Google 问卷，填写后请等待一下，或者留言告诉我，我每隔一段时间会抄送下载地址发给新申请的邮箱。
商店地址：
前往 Google 商店，如果你收到的我发的邮件，那么访问邮件链接即可参与测试，当然如果你忘记了可以点击这个在应用商店下载，有问题可以留言。
出海问题
遗憾的是，我作为开发者并没有接触过海外市场，我希望在海外组织一些社区，让用户可以和我们近一些，如果你愿意帮助这个 APP 建立海外社区，可以在下面留言。
开发问题
该 APP 采用 Jetpack Compose 开发，计划了多平台，无论是 APP 的开发，还是 APP 官网的建设都进展比较慢，如果你愿意参与，也可以留言。
最后，感谢所有参与测试的同学！]]></summary>

I downloaded an image of a fox by a wildlife photographer, its of 8K+ resolution and weights 23MB. When i open it Eye of gnome and zoom in, the fox's hair gets ultra sharp for a second at every step then gets normal... But in Pineapple viewer, i'm not seeing anything like that, it just zooms nicely at every step. Do they use different rendering techniques? If so, which one is better?

This library is two things: a very simple model and utilities that inference it (eg. fuzzy deduplication). The target platform is CPU, and it’s intended to be light, fast and pip installable — a library that lowers the barrier to working with strings semantically. You don’t need to install pytorch to use it, or any deep learning runtimes.
How can this be accomplished? The model is simply token embeddings that are average pooled. To create this model, I extracted token embedding (nn.Embedding) vectors from LLMs, concatenated them along the embedding dimension, added a learnable weight parameter, and projected them to…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[最近在读《三体》，看到叶文洁通过红岸基地，将地球的地理位置信息通过汉语与世界语的形式，将信号发射到宇宙中去，并介绍了地球上的基本情况，以及地球当前文明发展程度。
对此，我有个疑问，这在理论上真的能做到吗？
这应该是一些共识背景：
1.外星人对地球语言是一无所知；
2.该信号是单向传播；
3.外星人语言与地球语言是双向的一无所知，彼此没有任何的语言基础。
在这种情况下，真的能把汉语和世界语的语言体系编译成可解密的频率信号吗？并通过此信号向世界介绍地球的基本情况吗？
我个人认为理论上做不到的
我的观点是：不同语言之间的翻译和理解必须依赖于互动作为前提。比如我们知道“苹果”的英文是“apple”，这对应的结果是「中文」与「英文」基于长期互动和交流。
如果完全缺乏互动和相互的理解，单向发送的信号如何能让外星文明解读地球的语言？
换位思考，假设外星人向地球发送了一个信号，例如“a%pᵧɜ:◎”，人类能单向能破译它们表达了什么吗？我无法想象。语言本身具有极高抽象性，更不用说把语言进一步转化为更抽象单一化的频率波动的信号中
另外一些方面：人类目前应该无法准确定位地球在宇宙中的精准位置，或者说，人类定位地球在宇宙中的位置没有成为所有外星人的共识、地球在宇宙中的绝对位置并未成为全体外星文明的共识
因此，我认为这是理论上无法实现的，大家对此有什么看法？]]></summary>

It’s just annoying. I guess it comes down to security? Would tethered connectivity be easier and more open in Linux? All I want to do is have some basic bare bones software automatically copy certain new files when it’s connected — but otherwise leave me alone :-) with windows it seems like I need special software to accomplish what I want = extra complicated. Maybe linux is a doorway to freedom here? Is linux like the libertarian of OS’s?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[不管是 macOS 还是 Windows ，默认情况下所有播放的音频都会在输出前被进行二次编码，如果音频的频率（ CD 是 44.1kHz ，Hi-Res 音频都是 96kHz 或更高）和输出设备的频率（ macOS 对外置声卡默认选择 44.1kHz ，可以在 Audio MIDI Setup 里面改）不一致就会影响音质，因此需要用独占式输出来避免二次编码。（也有人给一些不支持独占式输出的流媒体软件做了自动切换输出设备频率的工具，例如 LosslessSwitcher ，但频繁切换频率不仅会导致每首歌开头 1s 没声，在 1s 的时间里相当于声卡被拔掉又插回去了，一些软件会直接 crash 。更关键的是谁玩 HiFi 用流媒体，大部分歌都没 Hi-Res 音源，有很多也是假的、升频上去的）
但是 macOS 的独占式输出有个很大的问题，被独占式输出的声卡在系统里也相当于被拔掉的状态，系统的声音输出设备会变回内置的喇叭，无法选中声卡，导致无法调整声卡的音量，非常不方便。同时这个时候 Mac 的音量快捷键也是调整内置喇叭的音量，已经不知道多少次我一边听歌摸鱼一遍看 YouTube 上的不需要声音的影片，习惯性按 Mac 的音量快捷键调音量导致视频外放了。Windows 就算声卡在独占式输出，也能直接通过右下角的音量菜单、笔记本的音量快捷键调整声卡音量，相比之下方便很多，也更符合逻辑。为什么 macOS 在声音方面这么不方便，还有人推荐 Mac 玩 HiFi ？]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[时隔我上个询问民办本科学生出路的帖子已经快一个月，也快中秋了，小弟在此预祝各位 v 友们中秋快乐！
也是开学了，现在是秋招，而我就读的广东某正学校并没有放人走的意思，计算机类，大数据专业的学生，在大四上居然还有专业课。
而且找到了实习也不能跑，一周必须回来上课两天，我找了任课老师，辅导员，我的指导老师，基本上给出的答案都是学业为重，不能因为找实习而耽误了学业，但是如今市场下，工作经验不比学校的课程重要的多吗，我是这样想的。
综上几个苛刻的枷锁绑在身上，又加之民办本科的 buff ，基本上身上没什么选择的机会了，只能说能找到计算机门类的工作都算是幸运的了。
而大学期间都在忙七忙八其他无关事项的我，并没有去找相关的实习，直到大四的现在，身上如今还是零实习，零项目，并没有过硬的技术，回首网课上学的那一点拿不出手，且没有实操的技术，也是令人唏嘘不已，是的，我把自己前半生玩砸了。
还好，幸运的是我找到了一个实施实习，是在海珠的 TIT 创意园里的某个医药公司，岗位是实施售后工程师，而且不需要和其他实施一样出差驻场，只要坐办公室吹空调，敲敲键盘就可以了。
说得好听是售后工程师，实则就是客户使用系统出问题负责售后的师傅罢了，之所以不用出差也是因为对接的都是小药房，和驻场大企业不同。
当时说是六点下班，而且有双休，我说了我学校的情况每周得有两天上课，也就是只能出勤三天，这公司负责面试我的组长也答应了，这个组长人也挺好的，没啥架子，很平和很宽容。
我也以为自己能够一直干下去，但是由于寄宿于天河同学家的我每天通勤都得一个多小时，而且并没有准时下班，这几天都是晚上八九点才下班。
明天是中秋假期了，今晚处理工单的老员工都跑得差不多，俩值班一线人员只有我和另外一个一起刚来的实习生，二线的只有一位姐姐。我处理到了九点多，没有吃饭，到最后，我的疲惫和积攒的劳累终于爆发，我很想很想逃离......
各位 v 友，感谢你们能够看到这里，我现在很累，澡还没洗，刚过完饭，很想一觉睡在地板上，但是我还是得我想问，我的路该怎么走？
是我太矫情了吗，客观来看这工作对于我这种人来说明明已经是一个很好的机会，同事也都是年轻的毕业生，他们大多也都做了一个月两个月，为什么我就不行？我就如此困顿？
从学校到天河这边住宿也得三个小时的地铁公交，从住所到公司又是一个多小时的通勤，是因为通勤搞得我太累了吗，还是因为我没有吃过苦，仍旧是未经世事的学生心态呢？
我入职的这个岗位是否有前景（对于我这种没学历没技术的人来说），我是否应该做下去，上个帖子很多 v 友建议我考研，最终权衡之后我还是放弃了这个方向，不是因为路不好，而更多是对我自己的不信任，我要是真有底子，就不至于读个民办了。
我此时此刻真的很想放松一下，我是个爱打游戏的人，但是从上次的挫折我已经很久没正儿八经玩过游戏了，我怀念那种当时不以为然的日子......
但我还是想再在这个土壤里卷一下，只求能够有朝一日润到某个发达国家，干着闲散活也能轻松养活自己吧，但是当下还是如何给我惨淡的前半生结个尾吧，希望各位大佬能够不吝赐教，小弟在此磕头谢过。]]></summary>

给 npm 、yarn 、docker 设置代理和替换镜像源，都没有效果。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[今天又看到有在讨论苹果法定节假日闹钟的话题 所以 iPhone 做点本地化功能就这么难么，不经让我想到了我 4 月份入职 [大小周] 之后饱受休息日闹钟叫醒的难受，不过我也只难受了两个周末就找到了解决方案。
我的场景：
使用设备 iPhone 、iPad
工作是大小周，部门钉钉有专门的工作日日历订阅（大小周、排班制这个很重要）
经常熬夜，起床困难户，每天早上需要 3 、4 个闹钟连环响才能起床
工作日需要一天在手机钉钉打 4 次卡，经常性忘记打卡
打卡解决方案：
已知必须手机打开打卡页面，点击按钮打卡（没有开启极速打卡）
网上常见的方案都是通过 自动化 + 闹钟 + 快捷指令 + URL Scheme ，实现到点响铃或震动 => 关闭闹钟 => 关闭闹钟时自动解锁并启动钉钉打卡页面，最后再手动点一下打卡按钮
实际试了下方案确实可行！只是仍存在如下问题：
休息日、节假日需要提前手动关闭闹钟，收假前需要手动开启闹钟，非常不方便
起床闹钟解决方案：
苹果的快捷指令其实非常丰富，只要有一定的编程逻辑，不难发现其实可以用快捷指令来控制闹钟的开关。同时上面提到的钉钉工作日日历订阅也是其中关键。
首先通过 CalDAV 将钉钉工作日日历订阅同步到 iPhone 日历中（法定节假日、大小周周末都不会有工作日日程）
快捷指令查询后一天日程是否存在一个标题是 [工作日] 的日程，如果存在则开启 起床、打卡 闹钟，否则关闭 起床、打卡 闹钟
如果你们公司没有工作日日历，可以自己在系统日历、钉钉日程、微信日程等任意可以方便维护日程的软件中自行维护一份工作日日程，一般除了节假日需要按放假安排调整一下，平时很少需要调整维护。
当然你也可以直接给部门管理、公司管理提建议，让他们添加一个工作日日程，这样全公司员工可以订阅这一个日历表，还能在前一天收到后一天的 工作、休息 安排。
单、双休解决方案：
对于规律工作日的朋友来说，周末都是固定的，只需要处理法定节假日这种特殊情况即可。
日历中订阅  [中国大陆节假日] 
快捷指令中获取后一天是星期几，判断是否存在 (休) / (班) 日程
开启或关闭所有闹钟即可
一些可以注意的细节：
闹钟可以添加标签如：起床、打卡、准备睡觉，这样在快捷指令中可以更方便的过滤开启或关闭的闹钟
快捷指令：
通过日程判断工作日
双休判断法定节假日
钉钉打卡快捷指令

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[坐标欧洲，家宽没 IPv6 ，经常连 Cloudflare WARP 来获得 IPv6 。
之前一直用得好好的，最近发现一个诡异的现象，Linux 下的 WARP 能得到 IPv6 地址，但是似乎不通，比如直接 ping google.com 自动解析到的就是 IPv6 地址然后没有任何回复，访问 ipv6-test.com 这类网站也显示 IPv6 不通。看起来像 IPv6 没路由。
更奇怪的是，如果跑warp-cli registration new生成一个新 ID 然后warp-cli connect此时 IPv6 就能通，但是一但重启之后就不通了，disconnect 再 connect 也不行，一定要registration new生成新 ID 才通。
已排除系统/网络问题，换到公司网络手机网络（均是不同运营商）都一样，而且 IPv4 一切正常，说明到 CF 的服务器是正常的。两台主力机一个实机 Ubuntu 一个 VMware 中 Ubuntu 均有这个问题，然后全新安装了一个 Debian12 来测试，除了 CF Warp 其它任何软件都没装，现象一模一样，应该是 CF Warp 那边的问题。
但是 iOS 和 Android 端的 WARP IPv6 均正常。]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[服务器上一直不停报错没注意，跑了几个月，竟然把 journal 的日志占满了。journal 日志一直没限制。后来清理的时候发现大概占了硬盘空间的 80%左右，其实是发现 ssh 登不上去了才发现这个问题。
商家的 vnc 也因为硬盘满了，tty 进不去。
还好进救援模式才进去了，不然只能重装了。一看是真的 100%，一点也没有空余空间了。
期间还发现了如果硬盘满了，挂载里面 loop 文件也挂载不上去，提示“块有问题”。清理完后就行了

后来复盘的时候才发现是一个 loop 硬盘满了，读写一直失败。导致宿主机一直记录这个失败日志，导致宿主机硬盘也满了。
硬盘满了后，感觉有不少软件会卡在 syslog 或者其他 log 函数上。很多软件都会出现预期之外的行为。]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[纯猜想，没有任何的实质证据和数据支撑，各位轻喷
我是在想，苹果在 iphone16 立项之初就对它的销量预期很不看好呢？毕竟最近一两年全球范围内的经济下行，消费低迷。苹果这么大一家公司，市场上是什么情况肯定还是非常清楚的。
所以我猜测大概有这么一个流程：销量预期不看好 -> 降低研发投入 -> 产品力下降 -> 创新停滞
或者换个说法，对于苹果高管以及股东们来说：
加大研发成本狠狠的创新然后产品大卖   =>  自然是 OK ，皆大欢喜
如果销量预期差，依然高成本投入然后销量低收益小  =>  不 OK ，公司要完
但是低成本投入然后销量降低收益变小  =>  勉强 OK ，能继续苟下去
也许曾经的乔布斯会选择拼一把，但是库克不会，所以就造成了现在苹果创新停滞的局面]]></summary>

请问有用什么方式 Macbook 远程串流玩 B 电脑的游戏最稳定方便（最好是用自己的服务，及并不想额外付费买服务），已经常试过的方式（除上方两个之外）：
①网易的 gmeviewer ，因不是自己的服务，还有以后付费的问题，不太想用
②自建 rustdesk 服务，不知道为什么总提示我‘链接被对方关闭’
③自建 tailscale derp…看不明白 docker 中关于域名证书方面（捂脸）

① 使用 ssh 实现内网穿透，将本地服务暴露到公网
② rathole

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[最近在做一个电表的辅助程序开发，遇到了一些困难，求懂的大佬给科普一下。
我仔细阅读了 DL/T 645-2007 标准，同时又根据上游给了几组合法数据，与设备进行了一些调试，发现目标设备数据格式并不完全和 645 标准一致，初步怀疑可能是采用了上海规约（因为设备产自上海地区），可是网上找不到相关上海规约的具体规范文件。
以简单的读表操作来说，上游给的正确数据应该是：68XXXXXXXXXXXX681104323733228316，但是根据 645 标准，数据域并不应该是 3237332283 。
同时设备上的返回值是68XXXXXXXXXXXX689139323733229c843433 fa373333373333336f333b3a3d33e73333333333b73475ac3375ac33333333333333575533333333b468333333333333335116，很显然返回值的数据域也与 645 标准不一致，看起来像是经过了某种 xor 或者数据偏移。而且只有数据域参与了偏移，控制位之前的数据位都是符合 645-2007 标准的。
很遗憾的上游需求方也是层层转包过来，具体的细节他们也无法给出更多的参考资料，只能给出许多正确的请求样例与返回样例。
因此，现在我就只关心一点了，这个设备的返回的数据是使用了某种地方性规范还是厂家自己魔改的。各位大佬们有关于上海规约的规范性文件嘛？如果对不上规范文件的标准，那这个活不干就是了。]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey all, I have a Dell XPS 420 desktop that runs my home minecraft server. It's running Debian with CasaOS and Crafty Controller. I got it for free from a family member. When I got it, I immediately noticed this little display on the top of the PC, the XPS Miniview. I realized it didn't have any driver support past Vista and I disabled it and haven't thought about it until now. I'm wondering if there's a way to display content like the local IP, stats and usage, uptime, etc. on the display, and how I could go about doing that. Also if it's possible to get those arrow keys working... If anybody has any knowledge I'd appreciate it. Thanks for reading!
 TLDR: Home server has a tiny screen on top. How do I make it display stuff?

 First what os can work on a pi and what are some neat use cases for a pi?
 Just curious because i know the pi is getting more and more pricey. I know there also alternatives like the le potato priced at 35 bucks, but is that the cheapest or are there cheaper than that? Im looking for something that acts just like a computer or server similar to the pi, and where might i get said board/tech at?
 Im a 18 year old student who wants to get into some tech and the pi caught my interests but its too pricey, also my parents dont really see a point to a board like the pi, so im curious of how i can convince them to let me get one? if they dont understand it.

现在的 iPad mini 6 经常会用 Google Fi 的 Data-Only SIM 和国内的宽带捆绑电信卡换着用。
鉴于以后没有这么方便便宜的流量卡给 iPad 用了，但是又有外出上网的需求，来请教一下大家有什么合适的套餐。
大陆地区的 eSIM 流量套餐和海外的 eSIM 流量套餐都可以。
如果最后实在找不到合适的套餐，那这次更新 iPad 之后可能就选择 Wi-Fi 版，不买流量版了。]]></summary>

 But, for me, the criteria to consider that the year of the Linux desktop has arrived, is simple: it has to be easy to install, easy to use, reliable with updates and able to run in most mainstream hardware out there.
 The only sacrifice or limitation allowed is the lack of Windows exclusive software, which of course falls outside the control of Linux.
 I currently have Fedora KDE installed across 2 laptops, one Intel, the other AMD CPU+dGPU. Yes, I avoided NVIDIA, but from what I hear from other users, NVIDIA works decently on xorg and keeps getting better on Wayland with latest drivers.

In the past, we had the "Linux Standard Base" (LSB), produced by the Linux Foundation, which created a common set of specifications. It was abandoned in 2015.
 What are your thoughts on this? Does anyone have insight into why it may have been abandoned? Does anyone think we would benefit from having a successor set of specs? If not, why?

 Really now, why is it so easy to do this? What's the point of a Windows user's password if other users can easily access a Windows NTFS formatted drive?
 Now, I know this is also possible via Linux to Linux, just as well as Linux to Windows. But I don't foresee Windows users being able to access Linux formatted drives, but maybe through WSL, which is technically Linux.
 Unless a drive is password encrypted, almost any data is accessible.

The top-level Settings homepage redesign that I previously spotted is now live in Android 15 QPR1 Beta 2. 
 
The keyboard quick switcher feature that I previously spotted is also now live in Android 15 QPR1 Beta 2. 
 
Another feature that I previously reported on is also live in Android 15 QPR1 Beta 2: The new status bar chips for screen recording/screen casting. 
 
Also live in Android 15 QPR1 Beta 2: The partial/compact heads-up notifications layout that I previously reported about! 
 
The color correction intensity slider that I previously reported about is now available in Android 15 QPR1 Beta 2! This is found under Settings > Accessibility > Color and motion > Color correction. 
 
External display settings - a feature I spotted last month - is now live in Android 15 QPR1 Beta 2! When you hook your Pixel 8 or Pixel 9 series device up to an external monitor, you'll be able to change its display resolution or rotation under Settings > Connected devices. 
 
Google has announced that Android 15 QPR1 Beta 2 enables desktop windowing support on tablets like the Pixel Tablet. 
 
Android 15 QPR1 Beta 2 enables the lock screen widgets feature on the Pixel Tablet. More details can be found in my article on Android Authority. 
 
Android 15 QPR1 Beta 2 now lets you customize the look of the mouse pointer, so you can make it easier to see.
 
 What's in development for later
  
The notification cooldown feature that used to be in the Android 15 preview - the one that stops notification spam - might be coming back in Android 15 QPR1. Here's a first look at its updated page in Settings. 
 
Goodbye Extra Dim, hello Even Dimmer! In Android 15 QPR1 Beta 2, Google is preparing to integrate Android's Extra Dim feature into the system brightness bar, so you don't have to remember to turn it off in the morning anymore.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Does anyone know which kernel version will be the next LTS release? I've seen some speculation around 6.12, but not from any official source. I'm anticipating the next LTS will be released before New Year's so that it makes it into the next Debian release (Debian 13's package freeze should happen around then). It would be a shame for Debian 13 to miss out on all the additions since 6.6; it will already miss out on Gnome's triple buffering support since that didn't make it into Gnome 47.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After using Linux (Fedora) as my desktop OS for about 10 years, I noticed that its speed advantage over Windows is narrowing. 
 First, the boot time is much longer than before. 
 Second, many apps are written in Python nowadays, and they are as slow in Linux as in Windows.
 Third, large web-based apps like VSCode are as slow in Linux as in windows.
 Fourth, some apps like Zoom and Skype have moved to sandboxes like Flathub, which makes them super slow. 
 I am not sure if this trend is what it is supposed to be, given the advances in hardware. I am also not sure if this issue is specific to Fedora.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi everyone, my home server is currently running Fedora Server 40, and has Nvidia RTX 4070. I wanted to discuss on how to optimize my gpu's power draw during idle. I have no monitors connected, and `nvidia-smi` reports 6w at IDLE. However, as soon as I start some docker containers with nvidia toolkit, the idle power draw seems to jump up to 13w. I have ollama-nvidia and open-webui docker containers running to be specific.
 I want to be able to completely turn off my gpu when not in use if possible, and start it back on without needing to restart my home server. I dont need my AI apps 24/7, and I would be happy to save Earth by reducing power consumption as far as possible.
 I have found some forums that show how to turn on draining mode: https://forums.developer.nvidia.com/t/how-to-turn-off-specific-gpu/107574/2 but I think all it does it stop monitoring the GPU stats, can someone tell me whether this actually switches off the gpu properly and not still draw 13w or 6w at idle??

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all,
 so I was wondering, is there better structured Linux Kernel Docs. For example, this archived old kernel docs: https://archive.kernel.org/oldlinux/htmldocs/kernel-api/index.html is much easier to read as there is much more summery for each chapter and sub chapter then new kernel docs: https://docs.kernel.org/core-api/kernel-api.html#
 As you can notice, Linux kernel docs -> Core API -> Core Utilities -> The Linux Kernel API in old docs is much clearer as it has summery for each chapter, where in the new docs, it is really one big blob. 
 Could it be that the web form could be somehow changed, and that is the reason of the difference, or am I missing something?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I saw a lot of fights between maintainers and Rust enthusiasts earlier. This is very irritating and definitely dangerous for our kernel stability!
 If you think this is too dramatic, a research from NASA proves that 60%-80% accidents are caused by human error in industry. Mostly due to humans' arrogance. Linux however, is now part of industry because most of us are relying on Linux. Especially for servers and routers. Imagine international-level internet outage caused by kernel bug. Linux community would be instantly die after that 😓
 So please stop... stop playing victim on each other.
 For Rust enthusiasts, if you think maintainers who still use C are resisting to give a "good documentation", that means they expect you to learn how those C source codes work then write a good Rust code from those. Same as when C devs are tried to learn how to code C based on reverse engineered binaries, or a hardware datasheet if lucky. Nothing is easy, no one want to spoon-feed you except you're a toodler. Simple as that.
 Anyway, I'm really sorry to say this long. This is my first time I wrote a long rant over something, because I don't want Linux to die. Even though it's too big to fail, but a civil war still can kill it.
 So please... forgive me if this hurts your feeling. I just want a peace, no more war.

It's a USB-C powered soldering iron and smart battery power hub. Super repairable, of course. Our goal is to make soldering so easy everyone can do it:

We didn’t want to make just another iron, so we spent years sweating the details and crafting something that met our exacting standards. This is a high-performance iron: it can output 100W of heat, gets to soldering temperature in under 5 seconds, and automatically cools off when you set it down. The accelerometer detects when you pick it up and heats it back up. Keeping the iron at a lo…]]></summary>

在我之前供职于蚂蚁金服时，我们内部有一款非常实用的模拟工具，名为“bakery”。离开公司后，我发现自己非常怀念这款工具，因此决定自己动手复刻了一个简化版本。
这个工具的功能相对简单。它可以通过 Vite 或者 Webpack 进行集成。只需设置相应的环境变量，就能开开发的时候自动启动 MOCK 管理工具。
开发者可以在管理攻击编辑各个 API 的模拟结果。除了可以设置固定的返回结果外，还可以通过查询参数、请求体或路径参数进行匹配。
Mock 数据将被保存在本地代码库中，这样便于与其他开发者共享，从而提高了开发效率和协同工作的便利性。]]></summary>

 I really like the tabs to open multiple locations that are always open when I open Dolphin. I have searched but can't find a really good alternative. Does anyone in the group have a good recommendation for an alternative to Dolphin?

Whenever possible, I’ve been trying to use Claude as a first pass when implementing new features / changes. But I found that depending on the type of change I was making, I was spending a lot of thought finding and deciding which source files should be included in the prompt. The need to copy/paste each file individually also becomes a mild annoyance.
First, I implemented `repogather --all` , which unintelligently copies all sources files in your repository to the clipboard (delimited by their relative filepaths). To my surprise, for less complex repositories, this alone is often completely workable for Claude — much better than pasting in the just the few files you …]]></summary>

Adding gamemoderun %command% as a launch option to steam games give me massive fps improvements for every game I testes in my library. For example black myth wukong went from 40fps to 65fps avg.

 Edit: So, even in this thread, gamemoderun seems to help some people and is useless for others. Maybe it would be good to collect more information about the situation:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[如题，几年前买了两台小米 k40 ，其中一台是我自己用了以后，觉得不错帮朋友买的。
结果还没过保手机就黑屏了，不开机了。他很忙也没有空去处理，闲的时候去了人家说主板坏了要换主板，哈哈哈。
我当时还给他出主意，说你先给小米打电话，说你这手机坏了，现在没有空修，别过保了去修，人家问你要钱。结果打电话也没用。
今天因果报应我的红米 k40 也坏了，正取着快递，翻短信的收件码，突然就黑屏了，开机键没反应，插电源也没反应。
我以为我很了解手机能避过这一遭，当年刷机卡 fastboot 我直接跑到小米售后说 9008 给我重刷一下，记得勾上刷完重启手机。很是潇洒呀，5 分钟不到就解决战斗了，一毛钱没收我。
都成我这种钉子户，小米早破产了，我现在极度怀疑这些手机厂商在各种机型上没有下限的往下探，制造手机报废计划。
初步怀疑 cpu 虚焊。过两天去售后看看，再回帖。]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've been a fan of Linux for almost 16 years, I've built a number of servers using different distros throughout that time, but the desktop side of things feels like a very different animal.
 More recently, I've wanted to put together a daily driver desktop. I want to move away from Windows and macOS in my personal use cases. I've been experimenting with different distros and a couple different DE's and WM's, and I'm struggling to settle on anything. I've tried Arch and I've tried NixOS, Hyprland on both, KDE on both, but I want something that isn't going to be a complete slog setting up. My goal is to build an environment that's entirely my own that's fully functional.
 Arch is great, I like the idea of starting with a minimalist build and going from there. NixOS is also great, I love the idea of (potentially) a single configuration file, the self-contained package system, and the ability to roll back changes, but my config file is getting to be a behemoth, and I'm getting the feeling that it's a better server distro than desktop.
 I would like to be able to game and develop (I want to learn Rust or build a game with Godot), and I also have taught myself how to use Photoshop/Gimp and would like to be able to do that.
 So what are your thoughts? What is everyone here doing on their own builds and why did you land where you did?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi,
I made this page to contextualize 13 billion euros (or 14): an amount owed to Ireland in an EU Apple tax case and all over the airwaves here this week. I use some pretty silly back-of-the-envelope type calculations (the same ones also repeated a lot in Ireland this week!).
These calculations aren't especially interesting, but at least they are present: you can see them, and you can change them. If you do - change the 13 billion to 14 billion for example, related numbers will flash with updates.
It's an example using calculang[1]: a language for calculations, and an example that focuses on a close connection between numbers that we read or share and formulas/workings behind those numbers.
I plan to do a separate Show HN about calculang perhaps when I have more docs and newer playground and gallery together, but Showing this page in case it's interesting, & happy if there is feedback!

有没有什么办法可以把 3.5 寸盘直接连接到小主机上的？ 我看别的帖子有说用转接卡转 SATA 出来，是否意味着需要拆壳子，没壳子运行？ 能否像服务器扩展 8088 柜一样扩展呢？]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have been so frustrated lately with pixel phones and I don't care about the AI crap and debate swapping to iphone. I had my phone rooted for a long time because I like more control over my phone. Google has been slowly eroding that and now I can't even use RCS anymore because my bootloader is unlocked. The only 2 things keeping me here are notifications and firefox.
 Anyways, to elaborate on the headline instead of ranting: Tensor is not great for anyone who wants to do anything with videos. It takes so long to cut the length of a video. And when I was blocking out the kid face it took so long to save that video.
 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8T7w7mzNqI8 here is a video showing how long it took to shorten 
 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8T7w7mzNqI8 here is how long it took to save.
 It is just really frustrating as when I want to send videos to my family it takes so long to shorten the extraneous parts. iPhones and even qualcomm chips are sooo much faster and I don't know I can in good faith upgrade to a $1,000 phone when performance on an every day task is so terrible.

对我来说，1080P 已经非常清晰了，我也没有 4K 屏幕设备，我个人感觉没啥必要，仅是为了提升那点肉眼难以擦觉的画质提升，太过浪费储存空间了
你们能分辨 1080P 与 4K 的区别吗？ 4K 对你们来说是必要的吗？
4K 与 1080P 的占用空间是 4 倍的关系，我喜欢这套资源，要是这套资源是 1080p 的，50G 以内的空间可以拿下，我会选择珍藏，但现在是将近 200G ，我在考虑要不要删掉了]]></summary>

Installed Mandriva onto an old castaway computer at age ten, reluctantly transitioned over to Windows at twenty-one. Seven years have gone by, and now here I am, dipping my toes back into the wonderful world of FOSS.
 Of course, as a young professional at age twenty-eight, it's no longer fun and games. I have work to do, and utterly depend on software in order to accomplish my tasks. If I'm going to use an OS, I have to be able to migrate at least some of my workflow to that system. So the question was, right from the word go, how much of this was going to be feasible. Application availability was the main reason I moved out of the Linux world in the first place.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've been reading a lot of posts in this sub after the Windows 11's downfall, I truly appreciate those who are recognising the privacy concerns and are trying to make their cyberlife safer.
 With MacOS breaking the limits of how proprietary a proprietary software can be, and Windows being a privacy buster since the release of Win10, there aren't as many options for PC users, except to go for a Linux distro.
 With that in mind, having hundred posts from users trying to move to Linux, asking questions about the most basic necessities to run Linux as a daily driver such as:
  
Choice of distro,
 
Choice of DE,
 
Best OSS packages for QoL, such as power management for laptops, color adjustment utilities, sound utilities, wireless utilities etc
 
 ...is not optimal. What I think can help will be a community effort to make a one-stop destination for such recommendations. The inspiration for this post came to me after I saw the anime recommendation flowchart in r/anime.
 As a fellow Linux user for the past year, I definitely agree with whoever that says there isn't a one-size-fits-all solution for any of the aforementioned necessities, and the customizability is what gives Linux the advantage. But I also think that it's equally important to bring attention to promising software so that they'll receive more support in the form of issues, feedback and PRs, and it will eventually help improve the Linux experience altogether.
 Ofcourse what I'm implying is a good starter pack, so that the user can slowly try out others as they understand what they feel is lacking in their current software, and give feedback to the software on the way.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've been testing this program for about a month now and I believe it to be the best drawing tool available (natively) for Linux. However, I very seldom hear any people talk about it - very unknown. 
 I find it is the closest Analog you can have on Linux (without fidgeting with Bottles/Wine) to something like Clip Studio in feel and workflow; though not features sadly.
 Krita is still decent but, it has it's own quirks so I always struggle to really use it long term. Linearting just does not feel as responsive on equivalent hardware. Fantastic for Painters though - but lacking for comic and Cellshading styles imo; in big part cause of weak selection and fill tools that I heavily use in such - lack of a "Gap closing" function being a big pain in the arse. Paintstorm pretty much solves all of that, I can go about just as fast as in Clip without having to do any manual adjustment.
 Only dealbreaker for some might be that Paintstorm is not FOSS - but well worth the cheap price tag to me. Development is not fast but a couple of updates a year is decent enough.

        <link href="https://www.v2ex.com/t/1072132#reply1"/>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[在前端使用加解密方式容易暴露密钥（或许一定会），但是如果把密钥藏起来，藏到二进制中或许就不容易被发现了。

sm4-sdk
是我用来验证想法的 demo ，下面介绍大概思路，以及有些踩坑的内容
一、基本情况
1 、使用 wasm-pack 这个工具来创建项目，编译成 web 类型
wasm-pack new sm4-sdk
wasm-pack build --target web

2 、使用了一个简单的国密库
cargo add smcrypto

经过一番研究发现它的 Padding 模式是 PKCS5Padding
3 、使用dotenv达成编译阶段注入变量的目的
从前端的工程化的一些经验中借鉴来的，dotenv支持从环境变量和.env文件读取变量，
cargo add dotenv

// file config.rs
use dotenv_codegen::dotenv;

pub const KEY: &str = dotenv!("SM4_SDK_KEY");
pub const IV: &str = dotenv!("SM4_SDK_IV");

4 、如何使用
克隆这个项目，将.env.example修改为.env文件，修改里面的密钥内容，执行
wasm-pack build --target web

二、踩坑
1 、安装wasm-pack
安装wasm-pack命令有两种方式，通过cargo或者npm
如果是 windows 环境，建议设置 default host 等设为msvc
// file settings.toml
default_host_triple = "x86_64-pc-windows-msvc"
default_toolchain = "stable-x86_64-pc-windows-msvc"

2 、使用github action自动打包
希望通过github action的环境变量提供给项目打包时使用，可能dotenv没有支持好，可能是我配置不对。不过不折腾的方式是配置repository secrets，使用时新建一个.env文件
// file workflows/wasm-pack.yml
      - name: create env file
        run: |
          touch .env
          echo SM4_SDK_KEY=${{ secrets.SM4_SDK_KEY }} >> .env
          echo SM4_SDK_IV=${{ secrets.SM4_SDK_IV }} >> .env

三、如何使用
参考项目中的example.html的做法，这个项目并没有上传到 npm 上，
<script type="module">
    import init, { encrypt_to_base64, decrypt_from_base64 } from './pkg/sm4_sdk.js';

    const run = async () => {
        await init();
        const origin = "hello world";
        const encoded_str = encrypt_to_base64(origin);
        console.log(encoded_str); // ${encoded_str}
        const decoded_str = decrypt_from_base64(encoded_str);
        console.log(decoded_str === origin);
        appendResult(encoded_str);
    }

    run(); // checkout console for result
</script>]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey HN, we wanted to share our repo where we fine-tuned Llama 3.1 on Google TPUs. We’re building AI infra to fine-tune and serve LLMs on non-NVIDIA GPUs (TPUs, Trainium, AMD GPUs).
The problem: Right now, 90% of LLM workloads run on NVIDIA GPUs, but there are equally powerful and more cost-effective alternatives out there. For example, training and serving Llama 3.1 on Google TPUs is about 30% cheaper than NVIDIA GPUs.
But developer tooling for non-NVIDIA chipsets is lacking. We felt this pain ourselves. We initially tried using PyTorch XLA to train Llama 3.1 on TPUs, but it was rough: xla integration with pytorch is clunky, missing libraries (bitsandbytes didn't work), and cryptic HuggingFace errors.
We then took a different route and translated Llama 3.1 from PyTorch to JAX. Now, it’s running smoothly on TPUs! We still have challenges ahead, there is no good LoRA library in JAX, but this feels like the right path forward.
Here's a demo (https://dub.sh/felafax-demo) of our managed solution.
Would love your thoughts on our repo and vision as we keep chugging along!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[几年前我买了软路由，把我父母家的内网和我自己的内网连了起来。
当时恰好有域名商家正在特价促销，于是我注册了 .guru 域名，用来给我两个内网做区分，同时方便相互访问，至少不用每次都输入 IP 地址。
（以下是示例，并不是我注册的真实域名）
我家用的是 *.myhome.itismydomain.guru，父母家内网用的是 *.thehome.itismydomain.guru
此后访问两边的内网机器全靠域名，很方便。比如访问自己内网的 nas ，我只需要进入 https://nas 或者 https://nas.myhome.itismydomain.guru 就可以了。
然而没多久就遇到一些小麻烦了。
每次访问正常网站，Windows 总会胡乱拼接域名。比如访问 www.google.com 、www.baidu.com 、www.icbc.com.cn ，Windows 时不时会抽风，向路由器发出这样的查询：
www.google.com.myhome.itismydomain.guru
www.baidu.com.myhome.itismydomain.guru
www.icbc.com.cn.myhome.itismydomain.guru
这样的域名显然不存在，浏览器只好给我跳个 DNS_PROBE_FINISHED_NXDOMAIN 错误码。有时刷新一下就恢复正常。但并不是每次都这么抽风，绝大多数情况下都是正常的。
我父母家那边的 Windows 机器也是一样，偶然会遇到 Windows 乱拼接。
Android 手机不会出现这种情况，Linux 和各个 BSD 也不会出现这种事，它们都知道什么时候应该拼接内部域名，什么时候不该追加内部域名。
已经顺手 Google 了下，发现类似情况早就存在了：

        <updated>2024-09-11T12:20:57.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey everyone, 
 A while back, I posted my Arch Linux guide covering full disk encryption with LUKS2, LVM2, Secure Boot, and TPM2 unlocking. For those who haven't seen it, the guide is here: Arch Linux install guide.
 Recently, someone pointed out a vulnerability in the setup that could allow an attacker to mimic the root partition using the same UUID to boot a rogue OS, then query the TPM for the decryption key.
 I've updated the guide with instructions on how to secure against this. If you're using TPM unlocking, I highly recommend checking out the update to make sure you're protected.
 Basically, how the protection works is by using systemd-measure to precalculate the hash value that's expected in the PCR 11 of the TPM during a specific boot phase enter-initrd. The boot process has several phases. And during each phase , the PCR11 is extended with the hash of the new phase. 
 Now during boot , during the enter-initrd phase, the TPM checks for other values in PCR 0 , 7. It also checks that the value in the PCR11 matches the precalculated value by systemd-measure, and releases the key. After the enter-initrd phase, comes the switch-root phase. This extends the PCR11 again. Now if an attacker tries to query the TPM from the rogue OS, he will fail, because the PCR11 value doesn't match the precalculated value.
 Thanks to everyone who has supported the guide so far! If you find it helpful, a star on GitHub would be greatly appreciated.

当时就认为这完全不是盘的问题，纯粹是对方系统或软件上的问题，因为他自己还用 DiskGenius 和chkdsk跑了一遍，没任何问题，就是不明为何分不了区。分的是 GPT 表，10T 的盘是没问题的。最后索性让对方退回了。
结果收到退回货后上机测试，马上声音不对劲，嘎嗒响（话说 V 站能上传音频么），硬盘完全读取不了。顺便在这请求下大佬们硬盘可能出现的故障原因。连机箱 SATA ，Windows 下 10T 容量能读取出，但读写完全拒绝，DiskGenius 扫盘全是 0ms 的红色，看 SMART 的软件都不识别； Linux 下 dmesg 有如下输出：
ata1: softreset failed (device not ready)
ata1: found unknown device (class 0)
[重复]
ata1: reset failed, giving up

没有出现任何设备文件，更别说用fdisk或smartctl了。
Linux 下连 USB3.0 外置硬盘座，同样没任何设备文件，且dmesg --follow-new里任何输出都没有，一片寂静。换作正常硬盘，就正常，输出一片 USB 和 SCSI 的信息。
问题来了，这件事会是哪方面的问题，是买家，还是快递（买家退回快递发的是京东物流，且包裹好几层，非常严实），还是硬盘本身真的有问题？我就想不通这硬盘是怎么自己出问题的。和发出前的照片比对了，没有调包，看螺丝也应该没有开过盘。这可以怎样处理，或是只能自认倒霉？
目前已有的证据：发货前的 SMART 、发货前的 badblocks 输出、对方收到货后的 chkdsk 正常输出（ DG 扫盘也都绿的，只是他没截图）、对方收到货的分区“IO 错误”消息截图，和我收到货后的坏盘运行声音录制。]]></summary>

 And all you have to do is:
 1)
 apt install nvidia-xconfig (if you dont have it)
 2)
 nvidia-xconfig --force-yuv-420
 Now reboot/restart display menager and you will get 120hz in the menu.
 I wasted probably 10 hours trying to install new drivers, reinstall debian, install fedora (which is broken with 6.10.8 kernel and 555 drivers) because i could not watch 60hz. Now everything is perfect

如有雷同纯属巧合
某个 idc 开业第一年把 mjj 用户得罪狠了，
然后从此沉寂了很多年，但这个 idc 很有钱即使没有客户照样运营，
某天这个 idc 换了个名字以不错的服务重新回到 mjj 视野中，而且故意名气做的很大，
起初这个 idc 的前科没有被扒没有被露馅，
后来出了个争议很大的高价服务，有些习惯平价的 mjj 不爽了，翻弄出了这家的前科，
但因为名气颇大，aff man 太多，于是社群被分裂成了两极，要么死忠要么死黑。
故事讲完了，现在我想讨论的是，导致社群撕裂的 到底是 idc 几年前得罪狠的过错更大，还是换名后故意将名气做的很大的过错更大？

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[我理解的保险就是把所有参保人的保费放到一起，发给需要理赔的人。其中需要扣除所有中间环节的消耗、保险公司的利润等等。所以从概率上来讲，如果每个人理赔的概率均等，买保险一定是一个赔钱的不划算的行为。
但是实际上有两种情况：
理赔概率不均等，有的人就是面临某些危险的概率更高，能获取理赔的概率更高。
理赔金额有可能超出了自己的支付能力。比如自己只有 20 万，一旦有重大疾病就完蛋了，如果买了 200 万的保险有机会以小博大。
因此保险还是有一定意义的。
但是反过来讲，如果是一个生活条件还不错，常见理赔金额自己都能掏的起，也不用面临什么危险的人，对他来说买保险是完全没意义的？]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi HN - DBOS CEO here with the co-founders of DBOS, Peter (KraftyOne) and Qian (qianli_cs).  The company started as a research project of Stanford and MIT, and Peter and Qian were advised by Mike Stonebreaker, the creator of Postgres, and Matei Zaharia, the creator of Spark.  They believe so strongly in reliable, serverless compute that they started a company (with Mike) to bring it to the world!
Today we want to share our brand new Python library providing ultra-lightweight durable execution.
https://github.com/dbos-inc/dbos-transact-py
Durable execution means your program is resilient to any failure. If it is ever interrupted or crashes, all your workflows will automatically resume from the last completed step. If you want to see durable execution in action, check out this demo app:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[📱iOS18.0RC 发布，爆出惊天大瓜：
📱12 及以上型号的手机，刷入 18.0RC 后，换拆机配件（电池、屏幕、摄像头等），都可以把未知部件跑诊断成正品部件；
👀然后降级 iOS17 ，也是正常显示正品部件！
❌第三方配件貌似不行，比如 0 排电池。
✔️所以市面上可能会出现一批换了正品部件的二手苹果哟！
📱 跑诊断流程：
1 、换好拆机部件
2 、刷入 iOS18RC
3 、激活后，开机——>设置——>关于本机——>部件与维修历史——>部件——>重新启动并完成维修——>一步步操作即可
4 、然后可刷回 iOS17

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[1. 背景
让我做一个数据中间件+前端 TradingView 演示网站，中间件的功能类似一个 adaptor ，从 alltick https://alltick.co/ 获取数据，然后数据展示在前端的 TradingView 上面 https://www.tradingview.com/ 但是我种种原因现在比较菜有点搞不定。。。 求大神评估下需求报价，另外问下这种小需求大伙都在什么平台上发，闲鱼行么。。。
2. 技术栈
后端：golang+iris
前端：vue3
3. 需求描述
前端展示要求需要能使用 tradingview 来渲染出数据中间价从 alltick 数据源获取的 K 线、实时成交报价、实时深度图（盘口）等数据
前端需要实现 data feed api 所有方法 https://www.tradingview.com/charting-library-docs/latest/connecting_data/Datafeed-API （包括 Symbols 相关、Bars 相关、Quotes 相关以及 Depth 相关的所有 API ）
1. onReady - 初始化 Datafeed
2. resolveSymbol - 解析符号
3. getBars - 获取历史 K 线数据
4. subscribeBars - 订阅实时数据
5. unsubscribeBars - 取消订阅实时数据
6. searchSymbols - 搜索符号
7. getServerTime - 获取服务器时间
8. getQuotes：获取当前报价
9. subscribeQuotes：订阅实时报价更新
10. unsubscribeQuotes：取消订阅报价更新
11. getQuotesHistory：获取历史报价
12. getDepth：获取市场深度数据
13. subscribeDepth：订阅市场深度数据更新
14. unsubscribeDepth：取消订阅市场深度数据
15. 后端中间件需要支持从 Alltick API 获取多种数据，包括 指数 股票 加密货币 金属
16. 设计和实现 Http API 以及 Websocket 消息数据以支持前端 data feed api 所描述的所有模型

4. 最后目标
前后代码告诉我怎么能在我本地搭建跑起来进行调试，然后网页显示没有 bug ，能进行数据实时推送]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We’re building Your Next Store, a modern, ultra-fast, open-source commerce in Next.js with Stripe as the backend - no DB required.
Selling online is often more complex than it needs to be. Setting up a storefront with great performance can feel daunting and time-consuming. There are many plugins, libraries, etc - the choice can be overwhelming.
Plus, in e-commerce, the backend and frontend are often written in different languages (e.g., PHP, Python, or Ruby for the backend). This increases the complexity and makes code management more challenging, especially for teams.
After working in e-commerce for several years, Michał and I set out to build the fastest and most compelling storefront for small to medium-sized merchants. Fast e-commerce sites are crucial because slow pages hurt sales [1]…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[坐标西安，30 岁，7 年大数据开发经验，二本院校，证书有高级系统架构，PMP 、英语四级，非党员。
希望 v 吧的大佬们，多给一些建议和经验，不胜感激。
有这个想法是因为
1 、现在的工作确实太卷了，虽然工资很高，但是没有自己的时间，996 是常态，偶尔还出个差干到后半夜，上周通了个宵，身体吃不消。
2 、自己的技术一般，不是那种可以非常钻研技术且能成为公司技术数一数二的那种人。
3 、马上到了 35 岁，深入技术对我来说是不可能的了，整日加班，所用到的技术不深，而且更多的时间要和客户打交道，聊业务，技术提升非常缓慢。
4 、年龄逐渐变大，许多公司尤其在西安，会考虑用人和管理成本，35 岁即使有经验，很多公司也会考虑性价比和管理成本，能干到 40 应该也非常不易了。（当然这是对我自己来说，厉害的大佬除外）
5 、房贷估计还有 10 年还完，之前月供 1.5 个 w ，提前还了不少，现在月供 4k ，一大半是公积金，经济压力也没有之前那么大了。
6 、希望找一个可以干到退休（可能没有，但也希望至少是可以比卷互联网轻松一些，正常上下班，周末能休息，职业生涯长一些），月薪在 6k 朝上可接受，最好能达到 1w 。（不知道薪资要求是高是低，确实没有了解过国企薪资，目前薪资到手在 1.7 左右）
于是我最近开始了解这方面的事情，有几个事情请教各位大佬：
1 、转行国企是否可行，在网上看到有人说，很多国央企不社招，社招的话也和互联网一样，很卷，工资还低，想问下在西安（也接受咸阳），有没有相对满足我上面提到的要求的国企，是否和网上说的一样，很卷，还薪资低。
2 、如果转国企可行，要找到一个职业生涯长一些，相对可以的企业，方向应该是什么，我应该如何准备，有什么渠道。
3 、有没有对于我目前的条件，可能有机会进的西安这边的国企，有了解的大佬希望可以给我说说。
4 、报个某树那种的培训班是否可行，我自己确实感觉在网上能自己搜索到的信息比较少，避免走弯路。
5 、如果国企这个路径不可行，还有什么比较适合的如我期望的职业发展路径吗？不那么卷，职业生涯长一些，至少干到 50 岁吧。
6 、希望加入到类似问题或者相关的圈子，有没有推荐
希望 v 吧各位大佬不要嘲笑，打工人日常焦虑整日思虑不清的事情，希望各位大佬多给一些建议，让我少走些弯路，多做一些正确的选择。最后祝各位大佬心想事成，发大财。]]></summary>

以下正文：
每次 Apple TV 直连 Watch 的时候都报这个错：Apple Watch 已离线，接入 WIFI 或关闭飞行模式，虽然用站里帖子的全局代理大法临时解决了，但总觉得不够优雅。
最终经过一番搜索，总结出根源就是GPS 版没办法单独设置体能训练 APP 的网络权限，但奈何我的蜂窝网络设置里的仅用于手表的 App，一直没有出现，我就干脆卸载了体能训练 App ，重新安装，最后终于出现了。
总结一下，我做了以下几步：
确保手机和手表的蓝牙连接正常、确保手机的蜂窝网络打开；
断开手机的 WIFI 、手表的 WIFI ；
手表上卸载体能训练 App ；
到手表上的 App Store 搜索下载体能训练。
等下载完，蜂窝网络设置里的仅用于手表的 App出现体能训练 App ！

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[最近老看到推荐 cursor 的，心想它到底能比 copilot 好在哪里，实践出真知，于是也上手体验了一下，用了两天后，发现确实还挺不错的，下面是一些使用感受，主要是跟 copilot 的对比。
• 更聪明，cursor 生成的代码更符合期待，上下文的理解能力也明显更强
• 更智能，copilot 只能生成行（区域）的代码，而且需要手动触发，必须回车一下或者是删除一下之类的。但 cursor 只需要你光标过去就行，而且能够一直在相关的地方连续的生成，也就是你只需要连续的 tabtabtab 就行。给人感觉就是 copilot 的定位是助手，而 cursor 有点代理的味道了。
最后想说，其实 cursor 更像是 vscode+copilot 的升级版，UI 不能说和 vscode 相似，只能说是一模一样。
这样的好处是用户从 vscode 迁移到 cursor 没有任何的成本
坏处是，用户从 cursor 迁移回 vscode 同样没有任何成本，如果 cursor 没有什么技术壁垒的话，copilot 很容易赶上并超过它，毕竟 copilot 用户基数在这摆着了。
另外，目前只用了两天，就有这么多惊喜，已经很不错了，其他的用法后面再慢慢挖掘挖掘。也希望大家能分享分享还解锁了什么惊艳的功能。

3 月底，我在 PDD 买了款儿童液晶画板，原价 50 多，平台折后 45.XX 元。
5 个半月后，画板擦除失灵，试过各种方法均失败告终。
去 PDD 申请售后，发现保修期只有 90 天，跟我对电子产品保修期印象相去甚远。
仔细查看该商品详情页，未找到保修说明，只在跟网店客服沟通的界面看到 90 天质保。
网店客服表示过了质保期，无法做任何处理，这超短保修期让我很不服气。
我研究了相关法规，该产品需取得 3C 认证才能在国内销售，有处罚案例。
于是我向网店客服索要 3C 认证证书，并提供了处罚案例，客服无法提供 3C 认证，反复拿一个别的检测报告说事。
我在平台提交了一个 23 元的退款 case ，平台转给网店客服，客服强调产品合规，谈判破裂。
我找平台人工客服介入，投诉该网店销售无认证产品，客服帮我升级了 case ，备注退款 50%。
不到半个小时，退款到账，是 100%，不是我诉求的 50%。
我的原始诉求是，我用了小半年了，按照一般 3C 产品质保一年算，折价 50%，补偿个 50%就 OK 了。最终结果却意外的搞成了全额退款。
问题来了，
原始诉求 50%退款是否合情合理？
平台判定的全额退款是否合情合理？]]></summary>

 Why IPv6?
 Many networks today still have inadequate monitoring and management of IPv6 traffic, even as IPv6 adoption grows. This tool takes advantage of this oversight, allowing you to easily deploy a rogue IPv6 DHCP and DNS server in a target network, providing you with the ability to:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[2024年9月7日，一名叫“亚人”的网红在北京圆明园游玩时，一位翻译让其“让一下”给日本游客拍照，随后发生口角。网红表示，“你在圆明园，让我给日本人让位？” 


2024年9月9日，针对日本游客在圆明园拍照被网红制止一事，外交部回应：不会针对任何特定国家采取歧视性做法。


2024年9月8日，人民日报旗下《环球人物》发文，批判网红制止日本人在圆明园拍照行为，并声称“民族大义不是流量密码”，“盲目排外在我国没有土壤”。以下是全文：



9月7日，网名“亚人”的网红在圆明园游玩，一名翻译在日本游客拍照时要求“亚人”让一下，受到“亚人”的拒绝、阻止。“亚人”的网名来自同名日本动漫，目前，“亚人”在某短视频平台上有32万粉丝。


事件发生后，大部分网友认为无端阻止日本游客拍照，非常不合适，有损大国形象。在网友质疑声中，“亚人”很快将帐号中的几百部视频作品删除。


我国的72/144小时过境免签政策，已让包括日本游客在内的大批外国游客亲自感受到了中国的开放与亲和——“中国社会既安全又自由”“中国人很热情，乐于助人”“交通便利，移动支付发达，生活便捷”。英美澳媒体对中国的“滤镜式报道”不攻自破。


此外，有网友发现了疑似“亚人”当年在美国留学期间的犯罪记录。


盲目排外在我国没有土壤，民族大义不是流量密码，“亚人”自以为抓住了“增粉神器”，没想到无人捧场。此前，一个名叫原田将太的日本网红，专门“碰瓷”中国游客，故意夸大中国游客在日行为，吸引日本的“无脑爱国粉”。目前，此人劣迹已被翻出：曾在疫情期间，在明知自己感染新冠的情况下，不戴口罩，去了多家人员聚集餐厅传播病毒，引起日本网民愤怒。


换位思考一下，能对素不相识、行为规范的陌生人，恶意地谩骂的人，也不太值得尊敬吧。（刘潇）]]></summary>

验证方法,拍张照片,找个 online exif data viewer(例如:https://jimpl.com/),拍照位置与网站中差个几百米.
图片中的坐标,在手机苹果地图, Google Maps 中和拍照位置一致(那就系统层面是 GCJ-02 ?)
修改手机地区,语言无效.
有解吗?]]></summary>

我隐约记得医生开药时说了开三天的药吃一下，但处方单不写这些，
现代开药好像都是整盒开，数了下一个药五天，一个药十天，
现在第四天已经不疼了，剩下的药就很纠结，
丢了吧，不舍得，花了几百块呢，
吃了吧，处方药，也不敢乱吃，
放着吧，还当心父母随便拿来吃了，曾经就有过，觉得咳嗽就是肺发炎了，发炎吃消炎药准没错，劝了好久，

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[从上家公司，已经离职了半个月，最近在跟发小打 CF 游戏的时候，聊了聊天，然后他知道我刚离职，还在找工作，就想让我去他们公司做程序开发，公司是初创公司，刚成立没多久，里面就三四个人，发小在里面担任技术总监，但是主管硬件方面，缺软件方面的，希望我过去填补这部分。
说实话，我不怎么熟，平时就喜欢吹牛，这次就吹大发了= =，自己水平也就照着市场软件，照葫芦画瓢，东拼西凑，写写小程序，自己用的水平，涉及的编程语言非常广泛，C/C++/C#/QT/JAVA/VUE/JAVASCRIPT/HTML5/CSS3/ANDROID/SHELL 这些主流，都有涉及，但是都不是很熟悉，只是说，看得懂，但是自己写，还是要靠搜索引擎= =。
现在就很纠结，到底要不要去那边，我发小给他 BOSS ，把我吹的天花乱坠，我怕到时候真去了，发现我干不了活，就大家都不好受了= =！
今天他们 BOSS 问我期望薪资了，我都不敢喊高了，我就随便说了个 8k ，对方直接同意了，我心里虚的很。。。、、、
他们那边不打上下班卡，双休，不加班，每天最多九小时上班时间，一般都是上六七个小时就下班了。但是不稳定，有项目就要努力搞，没啥事，就可以打混。。。、、、
唉，现在好纠结啊，求各位大佬给点意见≧ ﹏ ≦。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[With windows ruining itself, and with me getting a better understanding of PC's, I thought of making the move to Linux, but my main activity is gaming, I have a large steam library with a good handful of niche, forgotten, and unknown games, as well as using a lot of emulators for a lot of consoles, and I go ham with mods on games that have the support.
 I don't want to move to Linux yet if I lose out on any of the games I play, and I already have some performance issues with larger games and heavily modded games.
 So, how accessible is gaming on Linux? I've heard it's gotten better recently.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've been having some odd issues with my Ryzen 7 2700 for a LONG time, since I installed Windows 11 really. There were microstutters, it wouldn't boost above 3.3ghz. I'd have to use Ryzen Master (which was quick and dirty) or overclock the CPU in the BIOS but it was very unstable and would only let me get it up to 3.9ghz on any given core. I had no idea what it could be, bios is fully updated, all relevant AMD drivers are installed. I put up with the issue for now.
 Then I notice HIGH idle ram usage, like 9-10gb at idle, any ram intensive programs are shut down. Between all this and the Windows Recall stuff, I'm done. I download Endeavour OS, backup my files and wipe my windows install. BAM. I'm seeing reasonable ram usage and not only that, my CPU is ACTUALLY MAKING THE BOOST. 
 That's it.
 I'm happy.

 I installed Linux Mint in an old laptop a few months ago and I'm still surprised by how good it works and how complete it is. I wish the average user knew more about this because most of them don't even know Linux is a thing.

    volumes:
      # - volumeetc:/etc
      - ./data/etc:/etc
    command: tail -f /dev/null

volumes:
  volumeetc:

我的问题是:
如果使用 数据卷 volumeetc 挂载到 容器 /etc 目录, 启动容器后, 这个数据卷里的数据是完整的 etc 目录内的数据;
如果使用宿主机目录比如 ./data/etc 挂载到容器内, 宿主机 ./data/etc 这个目录下的数据不完整, 只有 hostname, hosts, resolv.conf 这三个文件;
我在 linux, mac, windows 都测试过, 都是这个行为;
调整过宿主机目录相关权限, 尽量和容器内保持一致, 也不行
我的问题是 为什么会有这种差异?
我个人推测跟容器创建的初始化流程有关, 但是没找到什么文档

他举例称，在德国，“别人在周五下班时，会将整栋办公楼强制关闭电源，以防中国企业在周六和周日上班”，在西班牙巴塞罗那，也有本地零售物流商，向政府提出要求，不允许中国企业周末加班。“把本地企业全部干掉，在今天是根本就不可能的，而且你的结局也许会很惨。”

Transformer-based models are getting bigger every generation, making the inference hardware requirements more and more expensive. Running large transformer models on device is even more challenging. Usually, they require trillions of FLOPs to run at decent speeds and use too much energy and space.
Our solution is to train ternary transformer models. There are two advantages to using ternary values. The first is that the weights can now be stored in two bits (or even less) from 16 bits. This represents an almost 8x compression ratio for every…]]></summary>

 I've learned that instead of a dependency tree like I thought of it previously that it's actually more of a topographical landscape represented by Direct Acyclic Graphs.
 So my question specifically is do the maintainers of the various package managers like apt, rpm, etc just have a single central DAG that references in a massive repo of packages; or, do they have smaller DAGs for each package that can be referenced to find out its specific dependencies?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[01 介绍
自己现在用的键盘是罗技的 K310 的一款薄膜键盘, 从 18 年开始, 一直用到现在, 中间因为手感有些发涩, 换了新的了
但是罗技在 21 年就停产了这款键盘, 询问过官方客服, 说明不再生产了
自己在咸鱼买了几个备用, 现在一直换着在使用
02 更换键盘的经历
自己以前用过一段时间红轴的键盘, 感觉太软了, 打字时间长了以后, 就感觉手指疼, 自己是那种按压很厉害的, 一定要有一定的按压感的
先后换了好几款薄膜键盘, 都感觉不太对, K310 不是那么短的键程, 总感觉哪里不太对, K310 是薄膜键盘但是他的按压明显比其他薄膜的按压感觉长了很多
试了下同事的青轴, 然后自己买了一款便宜的青轴, 用了几天, 感觉有点儿像 k310 的手感, 但是普通的机械键盘, 键程又太长了, 我不明白是哪里出了问题, 就是手感不太对
03 咨询的问题
有没有使用过 K310 的, 这款键盘不像普通的薄膜键盘, 它到底是类似那种机械键盘的手感
有没有青轴的键盘, 按压没那么深的键盘
青轴的声音有点儿吵, 有青轴手感的静音键盘吗?
实在是有些疑惑, 最近自己又开始想换键盘了, K310 停产以后, 自己心里总有些疙瘩, 虽然备货充足, 但是还是想更换一款类似手感的键盘
各位有没有类似的经历, 或者推荐的键盘, 谢谢!!!]]></summary>

第一个问题，USDT 似很少人自己去生成生成公钥/密钥（自己生成钱包），多数人都是选择托管钱包，比如 V 友 所说的欧易（要注册），或者在手机上用 ios 的泰达(Tether)（注册和买币都不用)
第二个问题，我看了好几个币的钱包，如果要自己生成，在本地运行一下类似哈希之类的，公密钥钱包就出来了，这个，是不是唯一的？ 我前几个小时还看到个说法，如果要发生和其它人的密钥一样，那长度，几乎不可能？ 是吧？       
第三个问题，不太记得在摸索的过程中，用过那个钱包还是交易所什么的叫什么名字，创建一个钱包，然后就直接在 app 里买 USDT 币了，我试着走下一步，然后就填信用卡了，这个我想问，如果用虚拟信用卡，比如 VCC 或者其它没有做过 KYC 的一次性虚拟信用卡号，不知道可以不可以完成呢？
第四个问题，目前把 USDT 绕得很匿名，应该怎么做？ 连交易中心都搞不清楚你是谁那种？]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[先说结论：是一个非常好的产品，但算不上神奇。（相比于其它用 AI 写代码的方式）
这个网站 https://www.justforfun.site/，是用 Cursor 花了 2 天时间做的，第 1 天基本就能把基本功能做完了，第 2 天主要在整理项目结构以及做一些本地化（敏感词检测）等补充工作。
Cursor 最强的功能无疑是 Composer 了，描述完需求后，就会开始生成代码，这没啥，重点是，它可以同时写多个文件，而不仅仅是一个文件，还顺便帮你把文件也创建好了，只需点击同意就完事了。（不过还不懂得删掉没用的文件）
代码补全也做得很细，改了一个地方后，它就会发现另一个地方也要跟着改，会在旁边提示你可以按 Tab 键，按下后就自动改掉了。多文件下，在一个文件的补全，会去参考另一文件的代码写法。很多地方都可以 Tab Tab 。
侧边的聊天功能，AI 可以只生成需要修改的代码片段，而不是整个文件长长的代码，点击应用后，它会自动判断代码片段应该插入的位置，而不需要你自己去找。
如果只是实现很简单的功能，只要懂一点编程的知识，基本上就能交给 Cursor 了。
但之所以说算不上神奇，是因为，当文件结构变复杂后（很快就会达到），AI 出错的概率就会开始上升，以至于你开始会觉得，还不如我自己改得快呢。
这个时候，就很难全权交给 AI 搞定一切了，你需要更多的介入，需要主动告诉 AI 去优化文件结构，去抽象组件，需要有意识的选择上下文。这点对于新手而言，可能会有一些门槛。]]></summary>

Auth ，需要 Apple 、Google 这样海外常见的第三方登录，需要内购验证 API （目前只有做 AppStore 订阅的打算）
用户的数据同步，都是文本内容，本地数据库用的是 objectbox （不知道用官方的同步服务会不会有未来迁移困难的问题）
web ，网页端用户管理自己的数据，一些简单的导入导出。给 app 用的 API 。
用户量可能一两年不会超过 4 位数，用户基本海外。
语言上有点想试试 go 的想法，但是我对 Python 比较熟，然后看 Apple 给的 app-store-server-library 也只有 TS 、Python 、Java 、Swift 四种，那是不是只能 Python 了？
Python 的框架在纠结是不是要用 fastapi(对这个库处理 issue 和 pr 的状态有点担忧)，想问一下生产使用的体验如何？
云方面，因为我比较担心自己管理数据库和服务器会有安全问题，现在我想用 AWS Lambda + API Gateway + DynamoDB 实现上面全部需求，不知道可行性如何？有没有用这样的组合做重活的例子可以参考？]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[前情提要:
书接上回,曾经发过一帖,求问如何校验网盘离线下载得数据是否正确,当时找到得办法是:
添加 torrent,设置存储目录为已有数据(由网盘离线下载得到)所在目录,触发 BT 客户端的校验
今天闲得蛋疼,一顿操作,发现这个办法也不可靠
环境:
WIN  10  X64+transmission(4.0.6)+qbittorrent(4.6.6)
这仨货都已经检查了 HASH/数字签名
操作:
①先使用[迅雷]随便下载好一部电影,比如[破墓.MP4],退出迅雷
②再使用 qbittorrent 添加同一个 torrent 到下载队列,设置[临时存储目录]为[迅雷下载目录],设置另外一个不同地目录为[最终存储目录],开始下载任务
③可以看到 qbittorrent 立即开始校验数据,校验结束后,也看到[破墓.MP4]确实被移动到了[最终存储目录]
到这里为止一切正常
④打开终端,执行命令:
date +'%s' &>>'破墓.MP4'
也就是追加一条时间戳(或者随便什么数据)到视频尾部
sha512 '破墓.MP4' &>HASH
记录被破坏视频的摘要值
⑤再从 qbittorrent 中[强制重新校验]该下载任务,结果不报错?
再重新计算该视频的摘要值,发现和第④步中记录的摘要值一致
也就是说,qbittorrent 识别不出这样地意外?这个所谓地“校验”完全不可靠啊?
⑥在 transmission 中重复同样地测试,也是同样地结果
⑦GITHUB 上找到了几个 torrentcheck 的 fork,其中有几个会检查[数据长度],因此能够探测到这种“意外”
你们有兴趣就复现一下?]]></summary>

第一步怀疑中病毒了，360 查杀没有任何问题。
第二步怀疑系统更新问题，卸载最近的更新，任然非常卡顿。
第三步重装操作系统，在重装系统的过程中也非常卡顿，重装后卡在 Windows 欢迎界面中无法进入。
之后使用 wepe 进入查看，扫描固态硬盘正常，打开 CPUZ 发现 CPU 频率只有 400MHz ，wepe 界面也比较卡。
请问各位有没有遇到过同种问题，应该怎么解决呀，电脑卡的没办法用了。]]></summary>

 So I had the crazy idea to install hyprland (not so crazy) and for some graphical application from (filebrowser, etc.) Cosmic.
 Did anyone else tried this yet? Do you think the cosmic-bar for example will work in hyprland? Any experiences? Do you see potential problems? Which polkit would you recommend?
 As mentioned, it’s an idea which came to my mind and I just wanted to get some feedback and additional ideas.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I finally did it, I deleted Windows completely and made Ubuntu (24.0.1) my main OS.
 It was a bit scary because of compatibility issues I might face, but I'm sure this forum, and many others, will guide me along the way.
 To give a bit of backstory… I'm a system and network engineer student, and I REALLY came into contact with Linux/Ubuntu in school because it's one of the main subjects (Desktop and Server). I tried Ubuntu/PopOS before but never as a standalone OS on my PC. I ALWAYS had Windows on backup if I needed it.
 Recent updates issues on Windows (black screens, stuff disappearing, glitches,...) got me extremely frustrated, and I decided to switch to Ubuntu completely. Not to mention the whole Recall situation that Microsoft wants to push.
 So, a quick question for those who have been in the game for so much longer. Is there anything I need to look out for and perhaps download to make my experience a lot better? I'm a gamer and student and love to learn new things about Linux, especially terminal related.

 Too bad the newest Mint doesn't support it - I use XFCE on my main machine, and on one hand it's decent, but on the other it looks too modern for me, and it wasn't as intuitive for a first time user as LXQt was.

        <id>https://www.v2ex.com/t/1071162#reply0</id>
        <link href="https://www.v2ex.com/t/1071162#reply0"/>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[今天下午，一朋友在某群 at 我，神秘兮兮的说道要考我一个问题。题目是这样的：
在 Java 中有 Father 和 Son 类，其中 Son 继承了 Father 类，两类均有 method 方法，现在 Main 类的 main 方法有如下调用：
Father f = new Son();
f.method();

问题是，编译此代码，完成后删除 Son.class，请问代码会报错吗？
我嗤之以鼻，这还用问吗？我甚至可以告诉你这个代码会报的错一定是 NoClassDefFoundError，这也太简单了你拿这个来考我 balabala...
然而朋友鬼魅一笑（？），你别急啊，题还没出完呢：
在上述代码的基础上，加入一个 flag justFalse，并环绕到上述代码中：
// in Main.java
static boolean justFalse = false;

// in Main#main method
if (justFalse) {
	Father f = new Son();
	f.method();
}

同样编译后删除 Son.class，请问代码还还会报错吗？
我大笑（？）道，这还用问？justFalse 永远是 false，也就是说内部代码永远不可能执行到，那么 Son 类也就永远不可能进入初始化阶段，所以这个代码肯定就不会报错了，这也太简单了你拿这个来考我 balabala...
然后朋友发来的一张图让我沉默了：

竟然真的会报错，难道 JVM 虚拟机会提前解析并未执行的代码行中包含的类引用吗？不对啊，这和我以前的实践完全不一样，怎么会这样...... 就在我陷入自我怀疑的时候，下一题来了：
在上述代码的基础上，如果把 Father f = new Son(); 修改为 Son f = new Son();，在同样的操作下，请问代码还还会报错吗？
我小心翼翼地问道：不会这样它就不会报错了吧...
朋友淡淡说道：正是。
我的脑海中此时一万匹草泥马奔驰而过，各种名词在我的大脑中穿过：类加载、静态分派、运行时多态、分支预测... 但没有一个能解释这个诡异的现象。
我的天塌了。 
深入了解 JVM 类加载机制
当说到 JVM 的类加载机制，很多人可能会脱口而出：加载、验证、准备、解析、初始化。如果你接着问他，他可能还会告诉你，解析这个阶段在某些情况下可以在初始化阶段之后开始，这被 JVM 虚拟机称为“惰性解析（"lazy" or "late" resolution ）”。那么，出现上述情况的原因可能是因为惰性解析被提前了吗？
然而答案是否定的，在任何情况下，对于一个类，无论其静态分派的类型是什么，其解析都会延迟进行。（即使在 JVM specs 中这种行为是未定义的，虚拟机实现可以选择立刻解析或是延迟解析）
那么问题出在哪里了呢？经过一番查证，我发现这个报错其实是在 JVM 类加载的验证阶段产生的。
注意，这里说的不是验证 Son.class 或是 Father.class，而是 Main.class。如果你仔细观察上面给出的堆栈轨迹（在 Oracle JDK 1.8, Hotspot VM 下），其中有一段就是 sun.launcher.LauncherHelper.checkAndLoadMain(LauncherHelper.java:632)。
在类加载阶段，JVM 虚拟机会试图校验一个类的某些部分是否是未被破坏以及符合预期的。在对 Main.class 类的加载过程中，对于 Father f = new Son(); 和 f.method();，产生了一个包含向上类型转换的多态函数调用，对于这种调用，JVM 虚拟机会试图进行校验，这就需要加载 Son.class 的类结构，而 Son.class 已经被我们删除了，所以产生了报错。
这种检查需要同时包含 typecast 以及多态函数调用，在上述代码中，无论将变量类型修改为变量的实际类型 Son，亦或者删去对 method 方法的调用，那么也不会产生报错。
最后，如何验证上述推断是正确的呢？很简单，使用 -noverify 参数关闭 JVM 的类加载校验，你就可以发现上述代码正常运行了。
（上述代码在 Java 1.8 和 Java 21 的 Hotspot 虚拟机上均能复现。为方便行文，对部分内容有所改编。）]]></summary>

现在离职状态，准备给自己放空一段时间，最长时间一年。想想以后的方向，顺便精进一下自己。
个人对底层比较感兴趣，尤其操作系统。自己写给一个迷你的操作系统。操作系统方向不只限于内核开发，应该也包括周边生态和工具等等。。但毕竟不是这行的，没有直接的开发经验。
现在 Rust 做系统开发是热点话题，想着就往这一方面发展。
不过兴趣归兴趣，也要考虑难度和糊口问题。毕竟岗位就少。所以想问问大家，这一行的前景如何，入门门槛如何？
有没有相关经验的老哥出来现身说法一下。什么建议都可以提。谢谢大家了。]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[最近把笔记本的内存换成了两根双面 48G DDR5 5600MHz 的内存条，进行了一下烤内存测试，发现实际上位翻转问题是相当严重的：
将笔记本平放在桌面上，烤机十分钟左右内存温度达到 96℃，然后再过十分钟有相当高几率发生内存错误（位翻转）
改善散热条件，使用暴力抽风散热器控制温度在 80 左右，位翻转问题不再出现
检索相关资料，发现还有更多人遇到这种情况：
有人的神舟笔记本，模具设计有严重缺陷，内存条温度甚至可以达到 120℃，然后系统在短时间内即蓝屏
华硕部分笔记本散热设计严重不佳，玩游戏经常达到 100℃以上然后导致内存问题游戏崩溃
可见现代笔记本工况（高密度，大容量，高频率，高温）下，位翻转问题是十分常见的，并非一般人所认识的—“只有辐射会导致位翻转，普通一辈子遇不到” 实际上高温下环境几分钟就出现了。
DDR5 加入了片上 checksum 机制，大概也是因为位翻转问题太严重了所致]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[依稀记得在 gpt 渐入大众的视野时，和朋友闲聊一个话题----gpt 和人类最大的区别是什么？有位朋友提到了创造性，gpt 虽然可以在短时间内快速给出接近人类思维的答复，但是给出的方案是待考究且可能是过时的。在同等情况下，人类不仅会基于专业基础还会根据其他学识综合当前处境调整应对策略，给出意想不到的解决方案。而 gpt 只能根据预训练模型中被“喂养”的知识给出一堆耦合成的弱连贯性回复，这一点在提问范围模糊时更有体现。
  
  但随着更多高级模型推出及用户使用次数提升，我们对 AI 工具(比如 Open AI,Kimi,Claude)的使用愈发上手，知道如何调整提问让它给出更精确的答案----我们只需要耐心把细节告诉 AI ，剩下的只需要等待、审视、根据上一轮答复微调提问。此刻我们不再是一个 Task Runner,而转变成了 Project Owner 。在 AI 降世之前，开发者们可能会因为写出一个复杂、抽象函数代码而沾沾自喜、自我陶醉在技术实现的世界里。而实现只是服务于功能运行，把关注点转移到架构设计、功能实用性，远比实现本身有更大的价值体现。受益的不仅是团队，更是产品及用户。
  
  AI 成为了我们的左膀右臂，意味着不必再为了数个类似业务重复劳作。既然如此，跳出劳动者这个定位，尝试从责任人的角度看待事物，那能做的事情就不只是实现层面。而是关乎整个项目起草，mvp 版本，需求迭代。这个过程则是产品间（或者独立开发）与自身、用户（甲方）商讨，及内部讨论大胆描述天马行空的想法，脑海里不断模拟、创造出期望的画面、思索细节，直到敲定了某一条分支，然后召集职能人员对齐理解，并着手开发。过程中的讨论、描述都是创造、设计的艺术体现，这使得我们对项目的理解层次得到升华。
  
  最后，AI 工具的面向群体愈发广泛，多数行业在熟练运用后都可以减少开发时的成本。请尝试着成为 AI 工具的 leader ，具体实现交给他们就行，然后全身心投入在需求分析、方案评审、可行性评估上，思路正确远比着手干来得重要且有意思。Project Owner 何尝不是产品经理，既然是产品, 则关乎设计，而设计便是艺术。

然后每次在列表中抽一些单词生成句子，反复多天多次我填写正确后认为我已经掌握，或者最后，句子的中午呢释义也不会给出，直接让我根据脑中的词库去填写。
我不是很喜欢现在单词 app 中输入单词列表，随机抓取单词，然后给我几个选项，让我选的形式，感觉很多时候选对完全没有意义。
感觉这样的工具应该是有的，并不想重复造轮子]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[💫青蓝读书会的起源
19 年我初到北京的时候，在这个城市几乎没有朋友，通过豆瓣加入了一个读书群，这个群里偶尔大家会自发进行一些读书会，让我读了很多书，也交了不少朋友，甚至让我对北京这座城市有了归属感。
后来缺乏维护，这里就没了之前有活力，线下读书活动几乎没有了。而后我也参加过很多很官方的，很正式的，很豪华的读书会，一位主讲人在上面讲，大家在下面做听众，尽管主讲人有些名气。但是我依旧怀念在吵吵闹闹的咖啡店里大家一起讨论书籍的普通人读书会。就这么我做起了自己的读书会。
💫这个普通的读书会📖能给参与者带来什么价值呢？
✨归属感
首先最重要的是归属感，会员制可以激励大家长期参加参加，因为成为会员后就可以免费报名了，长期相遇，就会产生友谊，产生温暖，并且愿意共同维护和珍惜读书会。
✨情绪价值
其次情绪价值，选择同一本书的人多多少少会有一些共同点，读完一本书总有很多感想、心得想和志同道合的朋友分享，在这里就已经帮你筛出了一群同频的人，可以在一个开放自由的场域下轻松无压力的自我表达。
✨社交价值
在北京这个节奏飞快的城市里，生活空间已经被压缩到只有公司和家，又不喜欢和同事交朋友，也不想认识的之后同行。读书会里就能遇到各行各业、不同年龄段的人打破僵化的社交圈。我遇到过移民多伦多的心理咨询师，文学硕士，体制内的研究员，一边开着自己的公司一边研究国学的大哥…
✨认知提升
我也经常觉得焦虑，但是工作越忙就越静不下心看书，刚毕业的 2 年彻底放弃了读书的习惯，后来报名了读书会，每次在开始前就会迫使自己读完，慢慢就养成了习惯。每次读书会也能从听到其他书友深入的观点，有的人甚至还做了思维导图，让我分析问题的视角都拓宽了。
✨自我表达
我也是个 i 人，但是读书会这种话小场子然后我表达起来毫无压力，随着场次增多看的书增加，表达也越来越有逻辑，越来越不怯场了。
✨双城记

之前租过一个小区停车特别舒服，总结了下有这么几个特点：
1. 有地库
2. 车位比高
3. 小区新
4. 道路宽
今年没办法只能硬着头皮停，等下次租房再说了。但感觉租房前也挺难完全考察清楚实际情况的，大家有什么好办法吗？]]></summary>

        <updated>2024-09-08T11:12:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[事情起因是这样的。前天的一个帖子里（ https://www.v2ex.com/t/1070885?p=1#reply35 ）大家都表示 AI 对自己的工作无用。我只是有点好奇，为什么我的感觉完全相反？所以想分享一下我的感觉和情况，很好奇大家感觉的没用是什么意义上的没有用（因为不了解专业程序员的工作流程）。
本人没学过大多数码，但是算法懂。因为工作和研究兴趣需要（ NLP ，很多很冷门的语言），也会经常坐一些很没办法要做的东西。比如分词器，就和 Andrej Karpathy 的网课跟着做，所以其实前一段时间看见他推荐 cursor ，我前天开始也就试着用。然后就觉得 AI 太有用了。我暂时感觉突然摆脱了对程序员的大多数依赖。
比如，试验阶段就很快用 prompts 做了一个全栈的、机构内部使用的工作记录论坛，感觉很兴奋。因为我之前既不会 java 、也没学过 sql 。就看着看着，debug 的时候，感觉就大概了解了构架、前端后端怎么互动的 blabla ，觉得很不错。我打算马上用现有的经验，写一个网页版的数据库，可以搜集结构化的语料 metadata （就是研究生会看古代语言的、就用这个网页进行标记并且生成结构化的元数据的 database 了，以后 training 时候用）（这样他们做习题就是 labelling slaves 了哈哈）。在之前这是想都不敢想的，肯定会想外包。但即便让专业 coder 做，也会有太多太多需要交流的小细节，比如很多语言是从右到左、从上到下，元音啊各种细节包不包括，乱七八糟的细节，这些调整交流起来会吐血（尤其是 coder 如果完全是技术部门来的），和 cursor 交流就感觉非常好，真的可以一个人把这个想了很久的事情做成。
再举一个例子，我之前也想过用 OpenAI 的 api 去导出一些专业的语料元数据，但是有一定的格式需求。我大概知道 function calling 和新的 Response format 可以实现，但是因为自己不是专业的，手笨不会做。但程序员一般都只会英语或者欧洲语言，对这些元语料的结构理解需要很多解释（因为现代语言一般语法都很简单），这是去年就一直搁置到现在。昨天突然想起来，半个小时之内就开始用 function calling 自动帮我生成 training data 了。今天打算晚点试试 response format 效果会不会更好。
所以我会感觉 ai 真厉害，尤其是很多事情可以一个人做了，会比团队快很多。可能有人觉得 AI 不会 debug ，其实不是这样的。第一，这几天 cursor+claudedev 几乎可以解决过程中 60%的错误。即便不能解决，很快要求它们解释哪部分代码是负责的，看懂之后很容易也能修好剩下的问题。（可能对程序员来说，没学过 java 看 java 的代码是荒谬的。但是实际情况是，其实 java 和 python 里也充满了自然语言，大多数问题理解了出在哪里就很容易看见并且修改。一些更高级的概念，比如类的继承啥的，单独看半个小时也基本理解了，虽然具体语句记不住但是可以问 ai 写。更复杂的 transformer 啥的框架确实要另外学懂才会改造，这个 ai 不行。还有， 剩下 40%的几率 ai 即便不能完全 debug 、但可以快速定位是哪些代码，定位速度可能比有经验的眼睛还快）
是不是专业程序员写的程序都比这些任务要复杂很多，所以 ai 会失效？还是什么别的原因会觉得 ai 鸡肋呢？真心好奇，避争论。]]></summary>

 I('d) use my phone for
  
music (downloaded) and video streaming/podcasts (sometimes a lot)
 
internet browser
 
writing code (probzbly with a terminal or light gui
 
ssh
 
messages and calls once in a while
 
 Besides concerns on the hardware and if it would fit me, I'm a bit scared the keyboard would be too small, but i do have pretty/very small hands
 Alternatively, whzt other device could you reccomend that could suit me ?
 Thankss for the help :)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am trying to ditch Windows for good, and for my personal usage I can already cover all my needs with Linux native software and progressive web apps. But for my job, occasionally I need to run full-fledged Word or Excel, and I'm used to PaintNET and Affinity Photo for high quality image editing that I do for publications, I also really like Wondershare Filmora video editor. I am debating which is the best alternative and wondering what other Linux users do in this situation?
 Dual-boot? A hassle having to jump back and forth between the two OS, not to mention having to keep up with Windows updates. I'd rather forget Windows exists as native OS.
 Wine/Proton? As of 2024 it still seems a convoluted process, pollutes your distro with Windows executables and libraries (eww) and of course there are no guarantees the specific app needed will run.
 Local virtual machine? - Not ideal if you are using a laptop on battery often as the performance overhead will drain the battery faster, also it just feels slow and thefore annoying to use.
 Cloud virtual machine? I never tried it before, I wonder what's the performance like, but surely it requires adding a monthly expense.
 RDP into a Windows PC? This is the one I am most inclined to, even though I don't have a separate desktop PC right now, but I tried Parsec to someone else's laptop and it really has low latency streaming if the connection is good, it's quite usable, more so than a virtual machine.
 Any other possibilities I am missing?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[下午突然发现手势控制空调失效了，排除了自动化执行后将问题缩小到空调伴侣上，很快又进一步确定是红外部分出了问题。为了判断是空调伴侣的红外发射还是空调的接收有问题（空调可以用自带的自动运转按钮开关机，排除本体损坏），翻出了雪藏了几年的原装空调遥控器来测试，一样毫无反应。
    
    到这里似乎已经能确认坏的是空调，可出于那么一点的不死心，还是想排除下空调伴侣和遥控器一起挂掉的可能性，于是掏出了 flipper zero 打算读一下遥控器的红外信号。然而还没按遥控器就读到了 rc5 0x00 0x0d ，甚至还是连续不断发出，遍布房间各个角落的离谱信号。
    
    此时开始怀疑是这个不知名的红外信号干扰了空调，就试了下怼脸开机，果然有一定几率能开启，那剩下的就只要找到这个奇怪的不停发射红外的东西了。几乎拔完一圈电源后才想到这个存在感极低的 Siri remote （ 2 代 4k 带的 L 口那款），组合键重启遥控器后一切终于恢复了正常……
    
    平时顶多会留心 2.4G 设备间的干扰，红外这玩意是万万没想到的，毕竟一般也没什么东西会连续不断的发射，也没想到 Apple TV 的遥控器还能抽风成这样。得亏顺手测了下，不然等找了维修师傅上门就尴尬了……]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've been running Linux for a year now and I finally deleted my Windows 11 on my personal computer.
 I mainly develop python, web nodejs, edit multimedia stuff. 
 I multi task a lot, having open many many applications at the same time.
 Once I installed debian on my second PC I was surprised on how well it ran GPU-less with only a AMD Ryzen 5 3600.
 My main pc is running i5 11600KF + RTX 3060. I'm considering switching to AMD, not just for novelty feelings, but also I feel like something is throtteling my multitasking.
 Only games I play are Oldschool Runescape, Age of Empire and currently CS2 again.
 What's your experience and setup with AMD? Can you recommend it? Have you experienced both sides?
 I run XFCE so it's not about wayland support...

开启 AI 时，需要关闭设备查找功能，整个过程很快，设备重启后，会要求重新登陆 Apple ID 。
效果：
1.AI 可以顺利开启；
2.设备型号变为 LLA （即美版），猜测修改了设备型号欺骗 iOS 达到开启 AI 的目的；
3.emoji 输入 taiwan 可以出现 emoji 候选，但是会显示一个 x （之前输入 taiwan ，会直接提示 no results ）；
4.Wi-Fi 依然显示 WLAN ；
5.因为使用 WI-FI 版 iPad 尝试，FaceTime Audio 本来就可用，暂不确定这个操作能否恢复国行手机的 FaceTime audio 功能；
6.不确定系统升级能否保留，但是抹掉设备一定无法保留，设备型号会变回 CH/A ，说明这个修改应该还是软件层面的，并未将设备型号的变更写入到更底层
之前很早版本，据说有特殊设备，可以修改型号到设备更底层，并且能解锁 FaceTime Audio ，后续系统升级/抹掉设备也不会受影响。
综上，这个软件看起来还是在系统层面的修改，无法固化到更低层，升级是否需要重新激活有待验证，而且应该非常容易被苹果封堵。]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[前言
好久没有更新了，最近比较忙，平时使用也积累了一些需求和遇到了一些 bug 。主要分布于新功能的构思与旧功能重构，最近遇到了一个棘手问题，不修改就满足不了使用，所以对部分功能进行重构和修改，决定更新一版，满足后续使用
更新内容
支持用户自定义目标路径，且支持本机保存可以跨项目使用
支持安装到所有用户（解决管理员下安装非管理员下运行问题）
修复了虚拟化问题导致文件列表展示不正确
修复保存校验个别字段不准确
修复工作目录和源目录拷贝文件错误
补充黑色主题部分颜色值
修复切换语言时导致主题列表显示错误
功能说明
支持用户自定义目标路径，且支持本机保存可以跨项目使用
在日常使用中常常遇到一个问题，比如我要将 A 文件写到 B 目录去，但是 B 目录又不在系统默认的目录列表内，这样就会有一个很尴尬问题，需要手动去改程序增加目录。最近给外国佬做一个程序，他们严格规定目录的写入位置，然后我在打包的时候就发现无法做到这点，新增了自定义目标目录的功能。
目标路径库 1. 这个是软件提供的目标路径管理的一个功能，可以提供目标路径检索删除新增等功能。打开方式：数据->路径管理 注意：当在项目页面打开时，默认编辑为项目的目标路径库，此时添加可以选择同步到本地，这样所有项目都可以使用，如果在首页进行添加操作则是存储到本地。
在程序集页面和多语言界面可以选择我们自定义路径支持用户选择自定义文件夹，就可以将指定文 件释放到指定文件夹下。

支持安装到所有用户
现阶段安装用于管理员身份安装，这样对于国内用户没有问题，但是由于国外用户有的有完整的权限校验，比如管理员下安装，各自用户下使用，导致程序无法找到，现在可以支持一键设置安装到所有用户。

修复了虚拟化问题导致文件列表展示不正确
修复了一个文件列表虚拟化 策略，导致修改后未保存的话，滚动到可视区域外会失效，需要重新设置的 bug 。（现在存在一个多选的问题，但是不影响使用就是体验稍差点）
修复工作目录和源目录拷贝文件错误
修复当工作目录和源目录一致的时候，选择文件出现拷贝无权限操作，导致程序异常。
修复切换语言时导致主题列表显示错误&补充黑色主题部分颜色值
修复切换语言时，导致主题列表刷新不及时，无法切换语言列表。并补充了部分主题颜色值
一点小感悟
最近工作比较忙，各种乱七八糟的事儿，也是用到哪就更新到哪，遇到问题就去解决。怕自己闲下来，又怕自己停下来没饭吃。人入中年，好多事情和时间都不是自己的了，不过我会努力更新完善的让它更易用，让它帮助到更多的人。

 He has had some success with ubuntu, but wanted to try other distros. 
 Today he told me he tried to install Kali, since it has some features that are useful for his programming. However, he could not access the screen reader through the installation process which rendered it completely inaccessible to him.
 I did some research and found that Kali has some trouble with the screen reader for the terminal, which people seem to solve by installing and using gnome as default DE. 
 I tried to help him remotely, but we haven't had any success. Unfortunately, today I can't videocall him to help with the installation. 
 So I came here asking for help: could you reccommend an accessible distro for people who need screen readers? It needs to be accessible since the installation, which can be done via terminal (he knows how to do it). 
 Additionaly, if anyone has a tip on how to solve the kali issue, it would be much appreciated. 
 Sorry for the writing, english is not my first language.
 Thanks in advance!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[我近期遭受的不公平不是简单的欠薪，提交一个劳动仲裁就行了，问题比较复杂。。。
前言
两个月之前我找到了一份 Java 开发的工作，跟我签合同的是位于外省的 B 公司，外派到上海某个甲方工作。我十年经验，但是当时 B 公司说只能给 14k ，并且试用期必须打八折，我说试用期不打折另外涨一点行不行，B 公司 HR 米雅说不打八折那只能签劳务而非劳动合同，但是如果你不要社保，这部分成本可以给到你加到工资里。我果断答应，失业了一段时间了，先把钱拿到手，社保以后再说。
用人结构
入职之后才发现，虽然在甲方大楼办公，但直接管理我的并不是甲方的人，甲方把一整个项目以项目制的形式给 A 公司，A 公司的项目经理直接负责整个项目，项目组除了我是通过人力公司 B 公司找过来的，其他都是 A 公司的人，我的用人结构就是甲方 - A - B - 我，工资要被剥削两层，这也解释了我为什么工资那么低，虽然甲方并没有为了我这个十年经验少付成本。
很显然这个工作是很坑的，钱少不说，风险还大，这个跟工程行业的层层转包一样，一整个支付链一个环节出了问题，作为末端的你就拿不到钱。
在甲方不知情的情况下，我被 A 公司项目经理单方面退场
A 公司项目经理给了我一个比较复杂的任务，第一个任务没做好害得测试和 A 公司经理陪我加了周六一天班这是我不对，但最后也顺利交付了，甲方的测试报告也显示这个版本我做的功能都没问题。
但是这事之后 A 公司经理没有直接跟我接触，辗转找到了 B 公司米雅，告知要退人，并且人员外包费只能结算一半。B 公司米雅告诉我，A 公司经理只给她们结算一半外包费的话，B 公司也只能给我一半工资。劝退我这个事情，完全是 A 公司经理个人意愿，甲方不知情。甚至也没找我谈话。
跟 A 公司项目经理谈话争取到延期一个月
当天我找 B 经理谈话，刚开始还笑嘻嘻，我摊牌之后才变脸。他说了我一堆问题，从工作能力…]]></summary>

        <id>https://www.v2ex.com/t/1070998#reply0</id>
        <link href="https://www.v2ex.com/t/1070998#reply0"/>
        <updated>2024-09-07T13:27:32.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[功能特点：
1 ，轻量级，APP 很小，几乎不占内存
2 ，利用快捷指令传送文字，如：在 iPhone 上复制一个网址或一段话，点击 ios 快捷指令[发送到电脑]，在电脑右键菜单点击粘贴，就可获取手机上复制的内容。相反在电脑上复制一段话，点击 ios 快捷指令[复制到手机]，在手机上使用粘贴就可以得到电脑上复制的内容
3 ，互传文件，方法相同
APP 地址：
https://github.com/YanxinTang/clipboard-online/blob/master/README_zh.md
使用方法：
在 Windows 下载安装 clipboard-online.exe,安装目录会产生 config.json 文件，修改文件
{  "port": "8086",
  "authkey": "",
  "authkeyExpiredTimeout": 30,
  "logLevel": "panic",
  "tempDir": "./手机",
  "reserveHistory": false,
  "notify": {
    "copy": true,
    "paste": true
  }
}
上面配置里面的./手机，会在 clipboard-online 安装目录下产生一个手机文件夹，iPhone 传送到电脑的内容都会保存在这个文件夹里面。
快捷指令（作者的快捷指令不够好用，分享自己修改版的快捷指令）：
发送至电脑
https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/bc28cd1c6ca14d448ae565dbeda3011c
复制到手机
https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/b3d2982bf5124ef69642f3e2b5b6ee53
注：需要把快捷指令里面的相应内容修改为自己的 WiFi 名称和电脑局域网 ip ，把电脑设置为固定的局域网 ip]]></summary>

1 、怎么选 4S 店，比如我想在北京买，开回老家上牌，还是直接回老家 4S 店选？这 2 者的区别：
    a 、价格差异很大吗？
    b 、售后保养是全国通用吗？
    c 、如果我在北京买完，会给京牌临牌吗，开回老家上牌之前，那我可以用京牌临牌在北京开 15 天吗？
2 、一般如果是现车是不是比较便宜啊？还是都需要预订，如果我现在预订的话，国庆前能开上吗？
3 、是不是贷款永远没有全款划算？贷款上征信吗？比如我之后要买房，是要还完车贷吗？

问题有点多，老司机们见谅。]]></summary>

写博客的人，对这种情况应该是深恶痛绝吧。自己写的文章被别人转载、洗稿，且未经许可。即使自己写的内容没多少价值和意义，但被人随手拿去粘贴在自己网站上，难以容忍。刚刚又点进之前洗稿我和其他几个熟悉博主的文章的网站，默默叹了口气。
刚刚发现，这人的博客还被 V2EX 的 vxna 收录了。]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So I just transferred lots of old school and software files from my college laptop to a usb. I have a good laptop already for most of my side projects and gaming, so I figured I would turn the college laptop into a Linux machine. 
 I've used Ubuntu and Raspbian (raspberry pi) before in the past, but for thos go, I was thinking about EndeavourOS or Fedora just to try something different. FWIW, I'm planning on using this laptop specifically to gain a better understanding of Linux and do a little bit of programming work, but it will not be my main work laptop. I'll probably connect it to my github account and play with a little assembly, C, C++, Python, and bash. Maybe a few other things. 
 So what do you think? I'd appreciate any comments or ideas. Any cool things I could do with this linux laptop. Thanks!
 FWIW the laptop is a Dell Inspiron from probably 2017. i3 processor, 8GB ram, 2.4GHz, 1TB HDD. So by no means is it cutting edge

 why do we ignore macOS though? macOS is closer to linux than windows, so I'd guess it's easier to get mac apps to run on linux rather than windows apps, there is a microsoft office version for macOS, why don't we try and get that working on linux?

 tl;dr - for "reasons", I'm trying to be a control freak about which processes get pinned to which cores on a single-die, multicore CPU. But I suspect I'm getting "fooled" by the Linux kernel's enumeration of the core IDs, such that it's giving me virtual IDs or at least different IDs across either simple reboots or reboots with new kernel updates. Is this true? And if so, can I configure anything to force the kernel to always give me the pure physical CPU IDs?
 Rationale: CPUs of the type I'm using (see below) have many cores with an internal set of ring busses that connect them. This puts some cores muc…]]></summary>

As far as we know, this is the first time someone has trained a video diffusion transformer that’s driven by audio input.

If you want to try it out, you can either (1) go to https://studio.infinity.ai/try-inf2, or (2) post a comment in this thread describing a character and we’ll generate a video for you and reply with a link. For example:

[正文] 
宇宙是时空，而 Universe 代表合一。时间与空间的区别的确也在宇宙学中已经消弭。
学到的东西，若从知见转变为体悟，便多一分清明。体悟是修行的路。
CBT 中这么多方法，改变认知入手的，改变行为入手的。凡是最后起作用的，都是帮助来访者获得体悟的。
CBT 也是修行。

2024-07-09 读过 | 宇宙, 物理, 科学 | 豆瓣评分 8.3
我给它 [ 4 星] ： 在经典力学，广义相对论，量子场论中探讨时间，最终在现代宇宙学的量子引力学，弦论，多重宇宙论等等猜想的框架下讨论时间。思考深入且精彩。但名不副实的是，它并没一直在讨论时间。时间之箭，只是个引子，目的是介绍宇宙学。作者很喜欢讨论熵的概念，认为时间的秘密与熵密不可分。
作为科普，作者写得不错，但对宇宙的探讨多余对时间的探讨，显然，作者认为时间是宇宙的一部分。
以上是书的内容，下面是我的感受。
时间真正的秘密，是时间并不存在于现实。
它只是个思维造的交流工具，就如同汽车是个交通工具。时间与汽车的存在有个相似性，它俩都因人而在，帮助人完成一些任务。把人从 …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[我，一个在 SEO 的道路上摸索前行的 30+高龄失业程序员。每当我看到 V2 的排名都稳居首页时，我都在想，自己的博客能否也有一天能这样？于是，我开始了 SEO 的学习和研究，我发现，SEO 这东西，不仅是一项技术，更是一门艺术。学习和实践的越多，越觉得自己越菜，我觉得我距离将自己的博客网站推向搜索引擎的巅峰还有 108000 里。。。
今天，我想和大家分享两篇我自己学习后总结的 SEO 教程，希望能得到大佬们的指点，帮助我少走弯路，快速提升网站排名。
下面介绍一下我的这两篇文章：
SEO 基础与实战技巧：初学者快速提升网站排名指南
这篇文章详细介绍了 SEO 的基础知识和实战技巧，无论是刚刚起步还是已经有一定经验，我希望它都能为读者提供实用的指导。通过这篇指南，我希望读者能够学会如何优化自己的网站结构，提升内容质量，并掌握有效的 SEO 策略。
另一篇文章是 SEO 新手必读：六个步骤教你找到易于排名的高效关键词
在下了解到，找到适合的关键词是 SEO 成功的关键。我在这篇文章中一步步总结了如何选择高效的关键词，以确保自己的内容能够精准地触达目标受众。通过这六个步骤，我的目标是让读者可以轻松找到那些能够让自己网站脱颖而出的关键词。
这两篇文章的总结一定有不足之处，不想误人子弟，所以想让大佬们斧正。我相信每一个小小的优化，都在为自己的网站打下坚实的基础，加油！]]></summary>

我的想法就是：
单独一次的请求肯定比两次性能好，万一有一个请求嘎了或者慢了， 表格数据就加载慢或者不出来了。
后端那哥们的想法是：接口需要保持单一职责，再单独出一个接口就重复了。
当时刚到那家公司，也没劲跟这哥们扯犊子，不过他给的理由我也无办法反驳，但是我感觉我的想法也是对的。
大佬们遇到这种情况，最佳的做法应该是咋样的啊。]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[这是一个困扰我很久的，关于读书的问题，我几年前在别的地方问过，但是没有得到正经的回答，今天看到有人在这里发帖问哪里读书合适，随又想起这个问题。
首先说明我的状况，我其实很少“读书”。除了上学时候的课本，以及工作需要相关的技术书，别的书基本没有完整读过一本。
至于原因，我觉得工作中用到的技术书读的也差不多了，其他的技能知识类书用不到。
那种“闲书”比不上看个电影
我内心中是把书有分类的。
大概就是“闲书”和正统的书。（其实不知道如何描述）
闲书呢。在我看来就是讲一故事。
以前上高中的时候，我有很多同学喜欢读那种小说，就是武侠、玄幻、修仙等等之类的。
还有那些传记类的书，比如乔布斯传等等

正规书，比如《算法导论》《母猪的养殖技术》之类的。
大体可以理解为学知识和听故事的区别。
以前上学特别不喜欢做阅读理解，让你分析作者这么写得意义是啥，还要给你个固定答案。
鬼知道作者是不是那个意思，不是说一千个人有一千个哈姆雷特么？
如果读书类型都是类似上面的听故事类型，那是不是跟追动漫，看电影，看综艺差不多娱乐成本居多？还是说也能从中汲取“养分”。

越说越觉得我自己拧巴，但是具体拧巴的点又描述不太清楚。
可能从小就把“读书人”这个几个字，跟知识渊博划等号。觉得读书是高雅的事。
从各个方面获取的信息来看，只要你读书就会被鼓励，无论你读啥。
郭德纲之前说过，不要总想着相声有什么教育意义，大家一笑一乐那就可以了。
不是硬要讨论读书还要分个高低贵贱、三六九等啥的，只是我觉得过去知识(技能)为目的的读书才叫读书。]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have recently tried Ubuntu both in a virtual machine and on an old laptop, and I was surprised by how much I could do with almost no knowledge about the OS and without opening the terminal. I was also very surprised by the speed and responsiveness of the OS in general.
 This makes me very tempted to switch to Ubuntu as a daily driver, especially as the list of Windows apps and games that are also being developed for Linux, or that work with popular compatibility layers (Wine, Proton, etc.), is constantly growing. Unfortunately, though, I closely rely on Microsoft's Office suite for work with classmates, and after trying LibreOffice, Wine, and the web version of Office 365, nothing compares to the native Windows app.
 What is Linux missing?
 Why are so many people/organizations still relying on an old and outdated OS like Windows?
 How long will it take for people to realize that Linux is the better choice?

也不考虑巨魔，自签的解决方案，最低标准就外区软件吧

微信公众号 看起来都是推广限免类软件
小红书 效率不见得比微信公众号多强

举例软件：

没想到换到 iOS 生态让人比较难受的是小工具的生态，这么多携带的广告就像是回到了垃圾安卓系统的各种广告软件
可能会有人说我“没事找事，这类软件有广告就算了吧，有广告也没啥问题，就当支付开发者账户的费用了”。
用过独立的、纯粹的小工具后对这样的手机生态还是挺羡慕的。虽然在安卓端小工具类软件相比 iOS 端免费软件是简陋的，甚至都是几个文字框，但是这恰好的解决了问题。]]></summary>

https://github.com/pagxir/dns-resolver-ng/
如果是在运行于国内使用（比如软路由上），则推荐配置如下：
const NameServers = {
  nearby: { address: "::ffff:223.5.5.5", port: 53},
  nearby6: { address: "2001:4860:4860::8888", port: 53},
  global: { address: "64:ff9b::1.1.1.1", port: 53},
  global6: { address: "64:ff9b::8.8.8.8", port: 53},
  oiling: { address: "::ffff:202.12.30.131", port: 53},
};
const Config = {};
Config.oilingMode = "China";
Config.preferNat64 = true;
这里 nearby 推荐使用 ISP 的作为国内的上游 DNS ，用于解释国内 A 记录
这里 nearby6 推荐使用 dns.google ，用于解释国内 AAAA 记录
global ，global6 用于解释国外的 A 记录跟国外的 AAA 记录，最好通过隧道走远端的 VPS 。
如果是运行于国外，例如搭建 DOH ，则推荐配置:
const NameServers = {
  nearby: { address: "::ffff:180.76.76.76", port: 53},
  nearby6: { address: "2001:4860:4860::8888", port: 53},
  global: { address: "::ffff:1.1.1.1", port: 53},
  global6: { address: "::ffff:8.8.8.8", port: 53},
  oiling: { address: "::ffff:202.12.30.131", port: 53},
};
const Config = {};
Config.oilingMode = "Global";
Config.preferNat64 = true; // 如果希望 IPv6,而不是 DNS64/NAT64 ，则修改为 false
最后的效果就是，国内域名会选择 ISP 的的结果，国外域名回选择 global 的解释结果。
不关注什么 DNS 泄漏，只关注正确的分流域名。
然后如果 Config.preferNat64 ＝ ture ，需要正确配置一下 NAT64, 不过因为国外走 NAT64 ，这样完全不干扰本地 IPv4 网络，硬件加速也不会受到影响，本地 ipv4 能不能跑满跟你没有配置前一样。
即使本地网络没有 IPv6 也可以使用的，就是需要配置.]]></summary>

 Theres a widely popular art software called Clip Studio Paint that was ported from PC to mobile and for that reason they added multithreading and GPU acceleration to the mobile version only. Now the mobile software is far more performant than the original single threaded PC software and I wish it was possible to run the mobile version on my desktop.
 If the Android port of CSP could be ran on PC it would be the most powerful and performant software available.

最常见的光猫+路由器组合，电信光猫自带的 wifi 关闭，有/无线网络都走路由器，路由器动态 IP 模式
路由器型号：华硕 AX86U Pro
发现问题过程：这两天突然发现有时候访问一些页面会巨慢，但是 speedtest 测速网速又正常，总结就是有些网页始终慢，大部分网页速度正常，偶尔慢。我第一反应认为是路由器出问题了，因为路由器常年无休，本身也挺热，没上啥散热措施，于是重启路由器也重启了光猫，无效。难道是路由器休息时间不够？直接路由器光猫断电一夜，第二天依旧会有这个问题。后来有/无线改为直连光猫，发现以前慢的网站速度变快正常了。后来确定了只有某些网站访问会出现这个情况，一走路由器就慢，直连光猫就正常，例如 msn.cn 这个地址。后来查了下有个老哥的现象和我非常像，不过他的情况更严重，直接走路由器某些网址都直接访问不了，我是访问速度巨慢。 最后的方案我也是参考了那个楼里的方案解决的。老哥的帖子链接 https://www.chiphell.com/thread-2524920-1-1.html
问题简述及解决方案：走路由器访问某些网站和走光猫直连存在差异，具体原因是 DNS 解析的原因。但是以前貌似没这问题，最终方案是在路由器设置里将 DNS 设置成了 223.5.5.5 ，之后设备走路由器的网访问之前巨慢的页面也都正常了，推测是 ISP 对二级路由设备有啥限制？或者有懂的老哥可以分析下]]></summary>

感觉目前生信还挺火的 大家都说“生物+计算机” 我本人对这个方向不是很感兴趣 因为我担心做湿实验没有生物科学的厉害 做算法又没有专门搞计算机的厉害 
不知道各位现在正在做生信的前辈对这个行业有没有什么看法 目前什么比较热门，分子？基因？
另外如果可以的话能不能推荐一些生信的学习方法 我感觉以后进组做数据分析也用得上 谢谢！]]></summary>

Most of the KDE income is from KDE patrons / corporate sponsorships and supporting members and donations. While they took in 349k EUR last year, on personnel costs alone they spent 317k EUR in 2023, another 43k on the Akademy conference, 12k on springs, 20k on other events, 22k on taxes/insurance, and 17k on infrastructure.
 	
 KDE in 2022 saw 285,495.97 EUR in income while spending 384,604.78. Back in 2021 meanwhile KDE saw 238,929.67 EUR in income while spending just 218,396.75 EUR.
  
I think this is the reason why KDE has started asking for donations

 最近才开通的 5G 网络，前两天突然遇到微信不能发图的问题，我以为是网络出问题了，重启手机后就好了。
今天准备扫一个付款码的时候一直提示失败，去微信客服给的测试页面也是打不开，直到切换 wifi 才能正常。
现在是如果收到消息推送，点进去以后转圈完了也没有出现新消息，延迟非常高，有些微信系统的链接打不开。
这才意识到这些问题都是开了 5G 以后出现的，网络设置的是自动 5G ，去网上搜了一些 DNS 描述文件，也没有什么效果。
看起来应该是一直广泛存在的 bug 了，有人有解决办法吗]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The question is simple: If you were a university student and you know you must have strong linux foundation in your field of job, how would you start?
 This is interesting because you don't solve active problems and learning along, but you have to do your own research, labs and all of it. There's a bunch of different ways to start it, maybe learn the study material of popular certs , downloading VIrtualBox etc..
 I'm trying to find a really comprehensive course that's just "teaching linux" and not following any company's structure. Is there a course like that?

 The recommendation then dropped to half your memory, once it became 'memory is cheap'. 
 Now generally I still create a swap partition, but only a few Gb in size. 
 There obviously are situations where you want a specific amount, like if you plan to use hibernation you'd want more. But... 
 How do people generally setup their swap these days?

It really sucks that people mostly aim for windows when creating games, so you have a way smaller library when gaming on linux (besides streaming games.)
 I know wine is an option but some things it just can't run :(

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello everyone! I’m wanting to change to a better operating system and have done some research and decided I’d like to try zorin os. I currently have a new pc build for gaming that is running windows 11. Im trying to get everything ready for the switch, I’m purchasing an 8gb flash drive for the zorin os download, and I figured out how to access BIOS to boot from the flash drive. 
 As far as back up of my existing system: 
 I have minimal directories with a few python files and about 8 PC games downloaded from Xbox game pass and steam. Can I use the internal ssd for backup or do I need to purchase an external hard drive? If I do need an external hard drive, what size should I consider or how can I find out the size I will need based on what’s currently in my computer? This is my first time and I just want to make sure I have all my boxes checked, if there’s any other helpful tips feel free to comment! Thanks:)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[最早初中的时候接触了易语言，当时接了不少私活，大部分都是找其他大佬开发的，其实自己懂的很少，应该是当时很小挣到不少钱，对编程语言开始很有兴趣，想着长大就从事软件开发这个行业了，因为以前学习差很爱玩，高中其实都没考上，算是走艺术生进的高中， 学了音乐专业后来又学了美术专业（因为之前初恋学美术，就没学音乐专业了， 当时就想着能在一起），只是为了通过艺术生渠道上大学而已，结果在美术培训艺考学校的时候和老师闹矛盾我就退学了，最后艺考也没参加，家里条件其实还行，因为家庭情况特殊（父母离异，又都从新组建了家庭），很长时间应该都在叛逆期，性格方面也感觉很奇怪，家里人也都惯着我。
高中期间（艺术生后期可以不用待学校） 2018 年在黑马程序员培训，培训期间学习没有现在这么认真，经常睡晚了第二天上课迟到，后来老师没办法让我和他们一起在办公室单独学习（看视频），毕业后当时行情还行没有现在这么差，学历经历啥的当时都是包装的，面试机会还是有很多的，最后也没面上，过了差不多一年（期间有娱乐有复习），一个算是培训班朋友的朋友给我内推到上海一个外企了（尼尔森，内推面试都没问什么技术），能力实在不足啊，英语差技术差社会经验也差，领导同事都很好，坚持了 3 个月，领导找我谈话很多次，觉得我进度太慢了，我就自己离职了，又开始了循环的娱乐复习娱乐复习找工作。期间意识到全日制学历的重要性，当时了解到了高职扩招可以弄到全日制大专（花了一周的时候调研，最后没走培训机构报考的，省了很多钱），2024 年终于拿到了毕业证。
2021 年的时候找到了一个工作持续到 2024 年（我也很介意虚假的包装，过意不去，我每次简历都改动的已经很贴近真实了，但是学历没办法，只能包装成大专，不然真的真的一个面试都没有，这家面试 HR 叫我简历发他，他进行排版，学历还改成了本科），在银行驻场开发，主要就是每天写存储过程和客户沟通，逻辑什么…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey all,
I'm the founder of Flipt, an open-source  (https://github.com/flipt-io/flipt) feature flag tool that I (and others) have been working on for the past few years.
About a year or two ago we added support for serving flag state from various non-relational declarative stores like Git, OCI, Object Store, etc.
Many of our users came to love the git-backed storage, as it allows them to keep their feature flags close to their code in there organization's repos. But they had one (rather large) ask, and that was the ability to use the UI to manage flag state changes and still use Git as the backend.
So today we're rolling out our hosted solution that does exactly that (and more soon).
I would love any feedback, questions, etc, or if anyone would give it a spin! Happy to extend the 14-day trial as well for anyone interested in providing product feedback.
Thanks!!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm dual-booting Windows 11 and Arch and recently had a need to reinstall Windows. I use two separate drives, and each have their own EFI.
 Windows does this annoying thing, where it will install its EFI stuff in any EFI partition it finds on any disk, even if it's not the disk you want to install to... but I thought of a neat workaround for this that doesn't require "unplugging your Linux drive" sorts of fixes... by instead, basically changing your Linux EFI type to something else temporarily, and then back.
  
Boot a live Linux distro (eg. Arch installer)
 Change your Linux EFI partition type from EF00 (EFI) to 8300 (Linux Filesystem) using gdisk (gdisk /dev/<disk> -> t (change partition's type code) -> Partition # (probably 1) -> 8300 -> w (write out))
 Install Windows (It won't find an EFI and will make its own on the same disk you're installing to)
 Boot back into a live Linux distro, and change the code back.
 gdisk /dev/<disk> -> t (change partition's type code) -> Partition # (probably 1) -> EF00 -> w (write out))
  
This was helpful for me, as my drive isn't easily disconnectable (NVME), and my bios didn't seem to offer a way to "disable" the drive temporarily. I actually found that even while my Linux EFI partition was set to type 8300, it was still able to boot fine (Im using Grub).
 Thought I'd share.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[主体内容
郑重声明：这是一则认真且有诚意的推广，无意割韭，只想好好做点事情，解决真实需求，确实有需要的人可以来交流，非常欢迎！但无此需要的人也请不要打扰！网络环境已经很差，如无必要可以少添一些堵，感谢 🙏🙏，以下是正文
我在认真做一个付费的 Go 实战项目社群 「云坊 —— https://yunosphere.com 」，面向以下有需要的人群 👇👇
去面试但苦于没有好的项目经验的人
有一定工作经验，想打磨个人的技术深度 / 广度的人
有稳定工作但是希望业余提升自己综合竞争力的人
有学习计划但苦于执行力差的人
想有一个优质的陪伴圈子，自己参与甚至主导构建完整产品的人
想参与真实互联网项目协作和产品构建过程但不知如何下手的人
我的社群目前正在快速发展中，上线半个多月已经有几十位用户 🎉🎉，圈子技术氛围非常好！大家专注于学习技能，做实事，不搞内耗，无闲聊。
不同于传统的知识付费社群，「云坊」目前被设计为以下模式：
以商业级项目制为主线，社群成员通过 Github 协作构建一个个完整的产品并尝试上线运营 🚀🚀
我会以项目为主线，产出配套的高质量私域博客和内容供大家学习（可用于面试求职）💰💰
基于产出的实战项目，提供配套的求职辅导，专业度可以看下方个人简介 👇👇
社群也会经常性地推出一些可实操的 mini 项目，既可练手又开发创意 💡💡
个人简介（吹牛逼）
双非本科、非科班，靠自学和摸索一套方法，11 个月从第一家小公司跳槽进阿里，个人觉得经历可以复制！作为我社群的福利也可以无私分享经验心得～。

同时，ikuai 同线路的 ipv4 是正常的。如图：

以为是运营商做了什么限制，用光猫拨号又是正常的，而且可以获取/56 的前缀：

光猫桥接的设置如下：

以为是设备的问题，换了爱快 Q6000 新装仍然是同样的症状，排除设备问题。
同小区另一台 N5105 软路由的 ikuai 一切正常，没有这个问题。
所以求助各位大佬，这个现象还可能是什么原因导致的？
ps：因为设备比较多，分布在不同的地方，为了维护方便且安全需要在不同的地方使用 ipv6 直连 RDP ，所以是刚需。]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[go memory model 中说:
...each read of a single-word-sized or sub-word-sized memory location must observe a value actually written to that location (perhaps by a concurrent executing goroutine) and not yet overwritten.
这句话是否可以理解为读一个字长以下的数据, 总是会读到某一次写入的数据, 而不会读到某个中间状态?
如果上述理解是正确的, 那么对于下面的程序:
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"sync"
	"time"
)

type A struct {
	data string
}

func main() {
	a := &A{data: "b"}
    
	go func() {
		for {
			if a.data == "a" {
				a = &A{data: "b"}
			} else {
				a = &A{data: "a"}
			}
		}
	}()

	var wg sync.WaitGroup
	for i := 0; i < 100; i++ {
		wg.Add(1)
		go func() {
			for i := 0; i < 100000; i++ {
				// 复制 a 的指针, aa 在接下来的使用中应该指向同一个 A
				aa := a
				if aa.data != "a" && aa.data != "b" {
					panic(aa.data)
				}
			}
			wg.Done()
		}()
	}

	start := time.Now()
	wg.Wait()
	fmt.Println(time.Since(start))
}

由于指针 *A 是一个字长, 那么读取变量 a 总是会读到某一个 A 地址, 所以 panic 不会发生, 但实际上会出现:
panic: 

goroutine 6 [running]:
main.main.func2()
	/Users/a/test/test.go:44 +0xa0
created by main.main in goroutine 1
	/Users/a/test/test.go:40 +0x44
exit status 2

这是为什么?]]></summary>

所以我想了两个方案
1. 浏览器端找能支持 h265 的播放器 js ，但是基本上找到的都是基于 wasm 的 ffmpeg ，也就是在浏览器端解码，然后通过 canvas 一帧一帧画，然后再用 audio 播放声音。感觉这个方案不是很好，可能会又吃性能又卡，还有可能声音画面不同步。
2.通过增加中间层服务，使用 ffmpeg+nodejs 进行转码(我不太会其他语言)。尝试了一下如果用 ffmpeg 完全把一个视频转换成 h264 的格式，耗费的时间会很长，有些长视频要半个多小时。
所以我现在的想法是：
	我看浏览器的 video 标签加载视频时，也不是整个视频缓冲完才开始播放呀，metadata 加载到了就可以播放了？而且貌似也是播放一点加载一点，这样是不是可以用 ffmpeg+nodejs 做成实时转码的服务？浏览器端请求一小段，就转一小段，这样子就使得该视频原生支持 video 标签了，也不需要额外的播放器 js 了。同时也能使用 video 标签自带的进度条拖拽进度
想问下大家我的这个想法是否可行？
还有个问题，我看到一些方案里写 ffmpeg 转 m3u8 ，然后存一堆 ts 文件，浏览器端再用某个 js 播放库去播放，这样存储成本是不是又上来了？外加转码服务的服务器成本，搞不好还不如一开始直接存 h264 格式？
ffmpeg+nodejs 有没有可能做到实时转码成原生 video 支持的格式，对于浏览器端来说属于无感知的转码那种的，不需要存文件，直接返回流给前端]]></summary>

昨天躺在床上玩手机，突然一想，是不是已经来上海 8 年了？
2017 年 7 月份的那个夜晚，我从苏州的泰南苑出发，当时的行李很简单，就一个书包和行李箱，坐着和谐号列车，深夜到的上海。
这个箱子还是我刚上大学那会买的，很重，但很大，我有点担心它挡住过道上别人来来往往，就想把它抗到头顶的行李架上，但是试了好几次都失败了，太重了，每次抗到腰这个位置就被迫放下了。旁边坐着的人肯定都觉得我很奇怪吧，他也太自不量力了，是不是农村来的土狗？
我不是第一次来上海，以前上大学时，每次都要来上海中转，一般都是晚上的车，所以下午我都会找个地方逛一下，一个人在这个城市里走一走。每次闲逛时，总会被上海的摩天大楼震撼到，这里的路怎么这么宽敞啊，这里的大楼怎么会这么高啊，马上就会有一种自卑感，有一种渺小的感觉。这种感觉留在我的心里很久很久，以至于工作后很久我都不敢来上海，觉得自己太菜了，不配来上海。
真正让我动心来上海的是，有个同学在上海工作很轻松，都是做程序员，他朝九晚五的，不用加班，我每天还要加班到 9 点多，关键工资是我的两倍多，这让我瞬间有些不服气了，大家水平都差不多，凭什么待遇差这么多啊？
刚来上海的时候，其实挺不顺利的，不仅是工作，还有生活。
我记得第一次租房子就租到了群租房，是一个客厅改装成的小房间，当时心里还美滋滋，1500 ，在上海一个高档的小区租到了房子，还挺能耐。同时也是自己第一次在外面租房，感觉还挺自由，再也没有人管我了，想几点睡就几点睡，同时对于我这种 i 人，也不用跟别人社交了，回家就算在家里静静发呆也挺好。
可是好景不长，一天早上，一阵急促的敲门声把我吵醒，打开门，一群叔叔带着一群农民工直接走进来。还没等我开口问叔叔什么事，那群拿着大锤子的工人直接把锤子抡向木板隔成的墙，大锤 80,80,80 ，那临时拼凑成的木板墙怎么会经受的住这种猛烈的撞击，三两下就都倒塌了，倒向了我的房间，我的床，我的房间就裸露在外了，他们砸完什么都没说，就走了，临走前还把电给断了。
这个社会不会直接跟你说这个是对的，那个不能做，只是在你做了一件事情后，给你后果，不管是好的后果，还是坏的后果，推着你继续往前走。
现在大家都说行情不太好，前几年是互联网的黄金时代，随便一个人，包装一下简历就能找到好几个 w 月薪的工作，看到很多短视频还在说，2018 年是最好的一年，值得怀念，可是对于我来说，2018 年真的没有想象中那么好，2018 年我工资就只有几 k,天天还各种加班，被老板 pua,怀疑是自己的问题，严重的拖了大家的后腿。
有种说法是苦难才能成就今天的自己，我并不这么想，我觉得苦难就是人生的一道坎，不管你是积极面对，还是悲观面对，它都是在那里阻拦着你，如果有的选，没人愿意主动去吃苦。
没有耀眼的学历，没有显赫的背景，在大城市里单打独斗，随着时间的流走，身上吃饭的技能总会比当初更加成熟，比当初的自己更厉害了，但是个人的成长永远都赶不上时代的潮流的。我已经忘记了当初选择来上海的豪言壮语，但我想肯定不是说为了找一份糊口的工作吧。
一个资质平庸，能力平庸的人在深夜胡言乱语。]]></summary>

看了国内在售的支持 homekey 的门锁，首先是 aqara 的 a100Pro 和 D200 ，跟客服聊了很久，感觉都不太符合需求。A100pro 没有门铃和自带的摄像头，D200 一个是价格，另外自带的摄像头也不能作为可视门铃，有点遗憾。退而求其次看了小米的一系列门锁，都支持到 homekit 接入，可以远程开锁，总感觉喊一句 Siri 就开锁有点不安全，不知道可不可以只把门锁状态作为自动化条件，限制 Siri 开门什么的。
最后想知道你们有什么推荐和自用的门锁，有没有什么推荐或者以上提到的门锁的优缺点作为参考。万分感谢🙏]]></summary>

        <updated>2024-09-05T12:49:06.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[《异形》是一系列科幻恐怖电影。首集《异形》（Alien，1979年）由雷德利·斯科特执导，之后又推出了三部续集《异形2》（Aliens，1986年）、《异形3》（Alien 3，1992年）、《异形4》（Alien: Resurrection，1997年）以及一部独立间传《异形：夺命舰》（Alien: Romulus，2024年）；雷德利·斯科特还执导了异形的前传系列《普罗米修斯》（Prometheus，2012年）和《异形：契约》（Alien: Covenant，2017年）。


异形1


2122年，商业太空船“诺斯特罗莫号”在航行途中收到了一组不明信号，飞船前往信号源地进行搜救，船员们在神秘星球的调查过程中，意外释放了一种致命的外星生物“异形”，“诺斯特罗莫号”的船员们不得不与异形展开了一场惊心动魄的战斗。





异形2


延续了前作的恐怖氛围，讲述了女主角在57年后（2179年）被救回地球后，与一支海军陆战队一起返回被异形入侵的殖民星球，与异形进行殊死搏斗的故事。





异形3


剧情紧接着第二部，2179年，女主角逃亡的飞船出现意外，坠落在一个阴冷黑暗的星球上，这个星球是一个关押犯人的太空监狱，只有一群被遗弃的囚犯和看守，异形也侵入了这个星球，由于这个星球上没有现代武器和科技，女主角和囚犯们只能依靠原始的工具来对抗异形。


更糟糕的是，女主角发现，在她体内还有一只雌性异形正在成长，最后，女主角和已经破体而出的异形一起投入了高温熔炉同归于尽。





异形4


2379年，女主角死亡后200年，在一艘名叫“贝蒂”的太空船上，科学家们通过克隆技术复活了女主角，并从她体内取出了异形女王的胚胎。


科学家们希望利用异形进行研究，但事情很快失控，异形逃脱并开始猎杀船员，女主角和一群雇佣兵联手对抗这个致命的恐怖生物。





普罗米修斯


《异形》的前传，故事发生在2089年，考古学家伊丽莎白·肖和同事在苏格兰的斯凯岛找到了一份星图，在韦兰公司的赞助下组建一支探险队，搭乘“普罗米修斯号”飞船出发前往星图所指引的行星LV-223，查找制造人类的“工程师”外星人，试图揭开人类起源的谜团。


飞船飞行过程中船员都处于休眠状态，由人形机器人大卫监控旅程，飞船于2093年到达目的地，结果发现外星人制造了一种黑色液体的生物武器想要毁灭地球上的人类，女考古学家带领普罗米修斯号撞击外星飞船以阻止外星人的企图，而外星人最终被巨型抱脸虫杀死，并生下了第一个异形。


2094年，女考古学家和机器人大卫一同开着外星飞船前往外星人的母星，了解为什么他们要毁灭人类。





异形：契约


《普罗米修斯》的续集，2094年，女考古学家和机器人大卫在前往外星人母星的途中，由于拥有自主意识的大卫改变想法，害死了女考古学家，并将黑色病原体遍布外星人母星，致使他们种族灭绝，大卫则留在该星球进行研发异形的实验，成功用黑色病原体创造出各种异形生物。


2104年，“契约号”殖民太空船载有15名船员和2000名殖民者前往欧瑞伽六号星球，因收到不明消息，船员们决定改变航线，前往信号发出的星球进行探索。


在那里，他们遇到了《普罗米修斯》中的机器人大卫，并遭到异形的感染和袭击，在契约号船员对抗异形的过程中，机器人大卫蒙骗了他们，并混入契约号，带着异形胚胎，独自驾驶着契约号飞往目的地。





异形：夺命舰


《异形系列》的第七部电影作品，故事发生在《异形1》剧情后的20年，2142年，一艘韦兰德太空探测器调查了二十年前被摧毁的诺斯特罗莫号的残骸，科学家打开了陨石，里面有一只异形。


几个月后，一群年轻的太空殖民者，为了逃离殖民地，前往探索一艘废弃的公司太空船时，意外遭遇了宇宙中最恐怖的生命体：“异形”。]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[之前升级 MacOS 15.1 Developer Beta3 一开始没遇到什么重大 bug,但体验一周后还是遇到一个无法容忍的 bug ，外接显示器无法识别，除非重启系统。表现是拔掉显示器 A 后连接显示器 B 直接就黑屏无响应了，有的时候会发生 A 被拔掉但是 A 一直出现在 Display 列表里，原因不明，网上也没看到相关讨论，可能是个例或者什么奇怪的软件冲突。但显示器连接属于比较底层的功能模块，会因为上层软件出现这么严重的 bug 还是很奇怪的。
这个 bug 严重影响到基本使用了，我总不能每天都完全重启一次甚至多次，所以只能降级。关于降级，除非有什么特殊理由要保留 MacOS 15 的部分数据，不然一定要降级到 Time Machine 的旧版本存档，不要用 Migration Tool 降级到新版本存档，否则很多系统自带软件的数据都会出问题（比如 Music 、Photos 、Mails 、Messages ）。这些 App 的数据库都是带版本的，你用 MacOS 15 的数据还原之后在 MacOS 14 下面就打不开了。当然也许可以硬改版本号强行打开，但会不会出问题谁也不知道，如果新版本系统的新增数据不多不建议这么干
我的降级流程
1 、进 Recovery Mode 抹盘。一定要抹盘，reinstall OS 是不会降级的
2 、重启后会出现 Install Sonoma 的选项，装完重启
3 、进系统后在迁移工具里选择 Time Machine 以前的 MacOS 14 的存档
这里说一下，迁移工具和 Restore from TimeMachine 似乎是两个不一样的功能，迁移工具并不是直接还原整块盘，所以会有一部分软件的配置需要重新操作，但量不算很大，还能接受。而后者在重装系统后是不能直接使用的，看上去 Apple 对这个操作做了一些限制]]></summary>

I figure there are plenty of other random issues this can cause for little benefit.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[One major issue with Linux distributions is that for each piece of software, there's a package for Debian, Arch, Fedora, Ubuntu, etc. Binaries are usually compiled dynamically linked (as opposed to statically linked), which means the libraries aren't contained in the binaries themselves, rather they're linked to system libraries. Therefore, you can't just run a binary from your Arch system on a Debian-based system. Many people say the solution to this issue is Flatpak, Snaps, and AppImages. These don't really address the real problem though. The actual solution is compiling statically linked binaries. This would also make it easier for developers to make binaries for Linux knowing they can be ran on any distribution.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[自带电脑在一家外包公司上班，近期公司网络调整了，需要账号密码登录。兼职那边上周很紧急的处理过一些问题，有推过仓库，也连过 sftp 。
9 月 4 号下午在 gitee 回复和关闭了几个自己参与的开源项目 issues ，然后下班前就被约谈了，当天应该只是 gitee 有过记录。
审计那边也没具体说是 gitee 还是云效仓库、sftp 。我承认了上班期间从事别的工作的事实，外包派遣公司联系我说是会罚款，但是劳务服务可以继续保持，外包公司还是认可我的工作的。
罚款大概 5 、6k ，需要两边公司再去谈，然后需要我作出承诺不再继续在工作时间从事别的工作。
个人觉得自己在工作时间内从事兼职、开源项目确实不符合公司要求，不占理。辞退、罚款等处罚都在合理范围。不过也比较担心审计那边究竟能获取到哪些数据，我之后在公司用自己的电脑需要注意什么？
手机、平板我是再也不会连公司网络了，笔记本开发必须连内网才能开发。
如果手机用数据，会不会被公司内的皮基站获取到数据。
深夜睡不着，手机码字，希望不要吐槽错别字和排版。]]></summary>

由于原来我已经把 m.cnbeta.com.tw 和 static.cnbetacdn.com 加在 ssrp 里强制走代理的网址中，防火墙里加一条 iptables -I zone_lan_forward 1 -p udp -m set --match-set blacklist dst -j REJECT （拒绝“强制走代理网址”的 udp 连接）就可以了。]]></summary>

后续考虑增加更多内容，比如一些独立的测评，用于选型参考。

Google DeepMind and their new startup Isomorphic Labs, are expanding into drug discovery. They developed AlphaFold3 as their model to accelerate drug discovery and create demand from big pharma. They already signed Novartis and Eli Lilly for $3 billion - Google’s becoming a pharma company! (https://www.isomorphiclabs.com/articles/isomorphic-labs-kick...)
AlphaFold3 is a biomolecular structure prediction model that can do three main things: (1) Predict the structure of proteins; (2) Predict the structure of drug-protein interactions; (3) Predict nucleic acid - protein complex structure.
AlphaFold3 is incredibly important fo…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[现在网络上一搜如何用路由器翻墙，全部是推荐 koolcenter 的闭源固件，且有以下特点：
1.宣传力量强。众多中文论坛的推荐都是 koolcenter ，显示出不同于其他开源内容的宣传力量。例如原生 Merlin 等。
2.Koolcenter 的社区提供的插件有规模。对于一个小众的网络群体（路由器端翻墙），社区中存在很多带用户界面、且可一键安装的插件，且常年保持每年更新若干次的频率。这一点力量也看出其背后开发和维护力量。
3.原 Koolshare 改版成 koolcenter 后，社区到底发生了变化也无任何消息？对于固件闭源的状况下，开发运营人员何种背景对于评估是否可信就很重要。
想问大家，是否有更多相关消息对这个社区进行了解的？]]></summary>

select a.*,b.*

left join b

Mem0 adds a stateful memory layer to AI applications, allowing them to remember user interactions, preferences, and context over time. This enables AI apps to deliver increasingly personalized and intelligent experiences that evolve with every interaction. There’s a demo video at https://youtu.be/VtRuBCTZL1o and a playground to try out at https://app.mem0.ai/playground. You'll need to sign up to use the playground – this helps ensure responses are more tailored to you by associating interactions with an individual profile.

腾讯的防护机制是否存在一定的漏洞？
我应怎么做？如果这个账号用来从事一些非法活动一旦出事是否需要自己承担责任？

离职的时候公司以没钱了为由，说以后融到资、给大家补发工资的时候才发。
仲裁胜诉后公司上诉，还不知道什么时候一审。近日收到了法院递交的公司的证据材料，发现他们早就融资到账，大部分在职的发了至少半年的工资。而公司的理由是，为了正常经营，发的是新的工资，而没有补发旧的，所以不肯给我钱。
太不要脸了。
朋友推荐了位律师，但是要收 5000+回款的 10%，我感觉有点太多了，毕竟漫长的仲裁我已经自己走完了，而且最后如果要不到钱，还得搭进去五千块钱。
但是到时候开庭不知道能不能远程，以及可能没有精力花在这上面，也许找个律师也好。
所以想请教下这方面的情况。
ps:
关于法律援助
得是经济困难才能申请
胜诉后可以要求公司出律师费
我在网上看到好几个这么说的，但是咨询的律师说不可以]]></summary>

对比 3 年前的自己

同样，破坏幸福感的办法就是：变差，或者跟比自己更优秀的人对比。
不过，改善能带来幸福感，这是无需赘言的，也有一个问题，就是幸福感持续的时间比较短，很容易习以为常，也就慢慢变得平淡了。如何让幸福感持久，这倒是一个值得探究的问题。]]></summary>

Graphiti helps you create and query graphs that evolve over time. Knowledge Graphs have been explored extensively for information retrieval. What makes Graphiti unique is its ability to build a knowledge graph while handling changing relationships and maintaining historical context.
At Zep, we build a memory layer for LLM applications. Developers use Zep to recall relevant user information from past conversations without including the entire chat history in a prompt.  Accurate context is crucial for LLM applications. If an AI agent doesn't remember that you've changed jobs or confuses the chronology of events, its responses can be jarring o…]]></summary>

可惜的是看了下付费也没有预算这个功能
例如我可能在未来买一个比较贵的东西，比如大家电什么，但是这个支出不是当下立刻，但又是未来一定的
我可以建立一个预算项目，输入这笔预算，需要的资金，他既不是负债（信用卡账单），也并不是一个支出，可以在总资产里，展示一个预算支出后的剩余资金
这笔预算真正用了，就可以修改一下实际金额，然后计入当期的正常支出里了
总而言之，就是记账软件有个人财务管理的概念]]></summary>

Cursor 最近在社交媒体上大红大紫，产品体验确实做的好，我也从 VSCode 切换到了 Cursor 。Cursor 刚成立的时候非常难用，但两年之后终于跑出来了。在我印象中，Cursor 是少有的不信邪，硬刚大厂成功的案例。

Cursor 在 23 年 9 月获得了来自 OpenAI 的天使投资，又在 24 年 8 月宣布了 6000 万美金的 A 轮融资
正面硬刚 Github
Cursor 背后的公司叫做 Anysphere ，成立于 2022 年，Cursor 是他们的第一款产品，2023 年发布。在 Cursor 发布的时候，Coding Copilot 领域实际上已经发展了相当一段时间，并且有好几个大玩家在做。
Github Copilot
Github Copilot 于 2022 年 3 月底在 VSCode 上正式推出，在 24 年 1 月份已达一百三十万付费用户，是目前 用户规模最大的 Coding Copilot 产品，并且仍然保持高速增长。
Codeium
Codeium 在 2022 年转型做 Coding Coilot 产品。今年八月底披露了 一亿五千万美金的 C 轮融资，目前有 70 万免费用户，并在企业级市场达成八位数的 ARR 。
Cody
主营代码搜索的 Sourcegraph 在 2023 年底推出的新产品线，目前没有披露用户数据，Sourcegraph 曾在 21 年披露一亿两千五百万美金的 D 轮融资
Tabnine
2019 年上线的 Tabnine 目前已经获得 2500 万美元的 B 轮融资，根据披露的数据，2022 年其用户量达到 100 万，并获得 580 万美元的收入。
这个赛道除了 Github Copilot 商业化的特别成功，其他虽然融了很多钱，但都发展的比较缓慢。…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[项目介绍
这是一个基于 Vue2 + ZLMediaKit 流媒体服务实现的零成本流媒体 WEB 管理项目。项目利用 ZLMediaKit 天然支持多种协议（ RTSP/RTMP/HLS/HTTP-FLV/WebSocket-FLV/GB28181/HTTP-TS/WebSocket-TS/HTTP-fMP4/WebSocket-fMP4/MP4/WebRTC ），并且支持协议互转的特性，构建一个轻量级的流媒体管理系统。

应用场景
通过 ZLMediaKit 提供的能力，可以实现从采集、编码、传输到播放的完整流程。以下是几个典型的应用场景：
音视频直播：适用于搭建实时流媒体直播系统，提供高性能、低延迟的直播服务。
在线教育：支持在线课堂的直播和录播功能，满足教学需求。
安防监控：用于监控场所的实时视频流和录像回放功能。
注意事项
项目内置了 push_streams.sh 脚本，用于推流模拟和流测试（在 Windows 环境下，可以使用 WSL 、Git Bash 或 Aechoterm 运行该脚本）。具体操作请参见项目文档。
项目未接入 GB28181 协议，你可以将这个项目作为 ZLMediaKit 的调试助手，或作为个人视频流管理后台进行个性化修改。
项目不包含后端代码，所有接口来源于 ZLMediaKit 服务。
结语
通过这个项目，可以实现流媒体服务的监控与管理，适合需要快速搭建轻量级流媒体解决方案的场景，这个项目不仅可以作为一个有价值流媒体开发参考案例，还可以用作调试工具，帮助开发者更好地理解和掌握流媒体服务的构建和管理流程。

然后呢，它慢慢又涨了回来，又梭哈了，回了点血，但是呢，又被英伟达报告给吓了，感觉 AI 有点泡沫化的趋势，眼看着要回的血都快没了，所以有基本跑路了。
目前留了 20 万，亏损额度在 6 万。
仔细回顾我的投资之路，还是有点后悔的。虽然有统计，梭哈 2/3 的时间会超过定投，但是，梭哈在历史最高点无疑是个糟糕的选择。

把百万资金分成 20 份，投入几个稳定的理财，然后每个月投资一份，死死拿住，绝不赎回。投资完一般后再决定剩下的钱继续投入还是存着。
一句话：用一半的钱，分 10 个月，定投（不投 A ）]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[海德时钟： 一款集合番茄钟、白噪音以及精美时钟的 App ，帮助你更快的进入专注状态。
App Store 链接： https://apps.apple.com/cn/app/hyde-clock-time-widget/id6476807443
承诺永久无广告，下面为当前主要功能：
应用简介

一、精美时钟:
由于需要长时间放在位置上查看时间，那么好看就是生产力，针对时钟的皮肤，未来我们会不断上新，增加更多耐看的时钟，此外时钟的设置非常灵活，除了更改时钟的皮肤外，还支持以下设置；
可以将 白噪音 / 番茄钟 是否在时钟页显示；
24 小时制 或 12 小时制
是否显示日期
是否有指针的滴答声；

二、番茄计时；
番茄钟：大名鼎鼎的番茄倒计时，真的很好用，可以设置番茄倒计时的时长，最多可以设置为 90 分钟，休息时间，从 5-30 分钟；
正向计时：将倒计时指针波动到 0 分钟，将开启 正向计时，正向计时最长支持 90 分钟；

三、白噪音：
这是我最喜欢的功能，音效可以自定义多个音效进行混合播放，并支持自定义每个音效的音量，从而可以模拟更多专注场景
支持开启多个白噪音，Mix 音效；
每一个白噪音都单独设置音量，从而模拟更多的场景；
音效暂停后，会记录上次播放的音效；

四、小组件：
个人最常用的工具，桌面小组件，最大的区别就是小组件的主题色会随着时间变化而变化，降低大家的视觉审美疲劳度（我个人真的太喜欢这个设计了）
——————————————————————————
开发者的话：
不少朋友问我市面上那么多专注类的 App ，为什么还要在做一个类专注的 App 呢？
最主要的原因是我们自己是这一类产品的用户。我不知道大家有没有经历过这样一些场景：针对某些不擅长或特别抗拒但又必须做的事情。面对这一类场景时，我就成了一个严重的拖延症患者，面对这类工作我的流程是这样的：
① 先墨迹一会，墨迹多久？取决于自己的羞耻心，有时候是几十分钟，有时候是等到整点的时间，有时候是墨迹很多天也迟迟不开始，这种就比较糟糕了。庆幸有时候我很快意识到了问题很严重性，墨迹个几十分钟后会继续后续的流程；
② 打开白噪音 App ，选择 2-3 个白噪音 mix 播放，带上耳机 ，调整好不同白噪音的音量（不听音乐的原因是，歌曲切换时，如果切的歌曲与状态不匹配会因为换歌而被迫停止，导致工作中断，可能又会回到磨唧的状态）；
③ 打开番茄钟 App 将专注时长设置为 25 分钟，休息 10 分钟（ 5 分钟不够休息）摁下开始专注，世界上最困难的事情终于开始了；
④ 除了白噪音和番茄钟外，我在工作时，会把手机充上电，确保工作完成时，手机电量是充足的，方便我玩手机：P 所以手机屏幕最好是亮着的，并且最大化看到当前的时间，是否正在充电。所以我增加了 1 个需求，搞一个好看的时钟
❤️ 这就有了这个 App 所有的功能！
最后再放一些其他的时钟设计稿，希望大家会喜欢，大家有兴趣成为我们内测的用户，请与我联系，我们正在招募内测用户，对于提供优秀建议与意见的用户会给与福利，正式产品的 3 个月、1 年、以及终身的产品使用权限，此外我们还会不定期设计一些周边送给大家。]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey all! Ever since I first discovered Linux, I've been quite interested in it. I like how linux is private and anonymous, unlike Windows. How it's so customizable to your like and taste. I'm not really a fan of Windows, I gotta admit. But so far, the advantages of Windows over Linux still kinda make me hesitant to really make the switch. Yeah, gaming is very doable now thanks to software advances with programs such as Wine and Steam's Proton. But unfortunately, some games still don't run on Linux, or they do, but not flawless. Especially multiplayer games which use anti-cheat software. Unfortunately some or most of them are apparently borderline malware, with how deep they can be nestled/rooted in the OS once installed. I've got an Nvidia graphics card, and though I found out there are linux drivers for them, I'm not sure how good it is compared to Windows. On my pc I've got Nvidia GeForce experience which neatly notifies me when there's a driver update. If I don't get a notification I just don't update. I don't want to manually check for updates every time I boot up my pc. Also I've already got plenty of stuff installed on my pc, and I'm not exactly thrilled if I have to reinstall all of it, if I switch to Linux. So far Microsoft haven't really done anything that I know of that made me determined to switch to Linux.

 I want to create a linux network that will wipe the hardrive of any laptop with any OS that's connected to it.
 I have a large quantity of old laptops that are being disposed of but I wanna wipe the drives before they go; this is for security reasons.
 I am thinking of using one laptop as the Linux distro host that will do the wiping of the others. I have a couple of switches that can be used to create the network. 
 I want to know if it's possible to just connect the laptops to this network and turn them on and the host will detect it automatically and wipe the machine.
 If it is possible can I be directed to the distro and apps required to make it happen. 
 I am more than willing to learn how to use the tools I just need to know which ones to use.

 I haven't meet people irl who uses windows vm as guest. Well, mostly they do WSL or dual-boot when necessary. I should request for a work laptop since my lapatop is dying from exhaustion and heat

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all, I just want to share my experience with Linux so far.
 I installed Ubuntu some days ago and I'm incredibly surprised on how good my experience has been, even in the gaming side.
 For some reason I couldn't get Linux Mint to work, so I decided to go with Ubuntu, and for the last three days I've been testing a lot of games I have on my Steam Library and the experience has been great, out of the box most of the games are working as good as on Windows, even games like NFS Unbound (I'm really surprised for this one, for some reason I thought this one wasn't going to work)
 I'm keeping Windows on a dual boot as there are some apps that I want to keep there and maybe to go back to a game that doesn't work on Ubuntu (like Horizon Zero Dawn, for some reason is not working) but I think I will use Linux from now on as my daily driver.
 I hope the future will be even brighter

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello, everyone!
My name is Alex, and I'm an expat in a new country. Two years ago, I moved to Germany where I didn’t know anyone. Starting the job, I realized that becoming close friends with colleagues can be quite challenging and slow. The feeling of loneliness was gradually growing.
To change that, I started attending various meetups based on my interests, hoping to make new friends. However, I often found myself answering the same generic questions that didn’t really help me understand if someone shared my values and interests. As a result, lost energy and 0 friends.
SO - That’s when I began using icebreaking questions in smaller groups. Surprisingly, these questions quickly changed any conversation to a deeper, more engaging and meaningful level. I was able to identify people I genuinely connected with and started spending more time with them.
BUT - preparing and using these questions was a pain. I would Google the top-100, pick a random number, and choose a question. I felt a strong need for a simple „one button“ that does everything for me.
AND - After searching and not finding such a solution, I decided to build it myself. I created a vast database of questions across various topics and integrated AI to generate questions on any subject.
The idea has resonated well within my communities (university and expat parties), and more people are starting to use it. I’d love to hear your stories with icebreaking questions, your experience, and your feedback so I can make the service even more useful for more people!
Check it out and share your thoughts!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I just started running Debian 12 on a new (well, used X230) laptop. On my MacBook Pro, I use Self Control to block food delivery websites, but I have no way of temporarily blocking apps. On my new computer I would like to completely block food delivery sites, and temporarily block certain social media and apps from opening when they are distracting. It's important that the blocks are not simple to undo. I'd prefer to use an app, not just the command line. 
 Thanks, and sorry if this is the wrong subreddit.

Today we're releasing a simple sketch helper for Fusion 360 and would love your feedback. Here’s a quick demo: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9n_eY-fM_E.
Why we’re doing this: Mechanical engineers excel at generating initial design concepts but get bogged down translating ideas into final designs due to tedious, repetitive tasks. Our goal is to automate these mundane processes, allowing engineers to focus on the creative aspects of design.
Having worked at multiple hardware companies—from medical devices to space launch vehicles—we know how often “trivial” components such as manufacturing rigging, get brushed under the table in scheduling conversations.  These tasks aren’t necessari…]]></summary>

It has panning, zooming, and dragging elements around. The settings closely follow html/css. We think an open canvas is a big improvement over other website builders. Everything is easier: styling, consistency, responsiveness…
But making it work was hard! We thought HN would appreciate the tech behind it:
- A custom WebGL rendering engine (w/text, shadows, blurs, gradients, & opacity groups)
- A partial implementation of the css spec
- A custom text editor & text shaper
- A transformer to turn designs into publishable html/css
Repaint is a design tool for html/css. But internally, it doesn’t actually use html/css itself. All your designs live in a single  element.

But I'm thinking of changing client since HexChat is abandonware at this point, and I'm facing a problem with HexChat's font rendering on Linux, which could totally be a distro-specific thing.
 I'd like some suggestions on which new IRC client to migrate to, and would like to avoid CLI-based clients. One GUI client that I've tried is Konversation, which has a nice GUI but is considerably less extensive in terms of features compared to HexChat.

现在是域名挂 cf ，服务器只允许 cf 的 ip 入站，这样源站即使被攻击者发现 IP 地址，是否也没办法直接攻击我的源服务器了？因为防火墙把其他 IP 挡掉了。
免费版的 CF 可以挡住一些攻击，但是如果攻击者加强攻势，CF5 秒盾依然挡不住。这时候升级付费版是否有用？
看了阮一峰的 ddos 文章，还有搞镜像服务器的套路来防； ddos 的攻击成本是多少？今天半天打我的流量看了一下，有几百 G ，难道不用钱吗？因为我的站并没有收益，所以我暂时没花钱来做防护。]]></summary>

This is an open source plasmid and vector (Short, often circular segments of DNA) editor, with features related to primer quality checks, PCR cloning, and protein analysis. I plan to add more restriction-enzyme-based features in the near future. It has some extras like a solution-mixing helper, automatic feature annotation.
From a technical standpoint, this is a standalone binary written using the EGUI library in rust. A project goal is performance, with small memory footprint, and small application and file sizes.
This is a continuous work-in-progress, and I'm open to any and all feedback, criticism, and requested features.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[房子卖掉了，亏了小几万，可以接受，就当买个教训。
以后都不敢把希望寄托在邻居的素质上了。当然还有新房的质量上了。
把从买到卖，盘点一下，才发现一路走来，真的一步一坑。
一 买房
当时还是限购， 需要摇号。
我家就一个人有资格，
摇中后， 两个选择：
1 付定金 2w 。  2 放弃购买，半年内无资格参与摇号
当时只有样板间，也没什么好参考的，
所以除非有特别原因 等同于只能选 1 。
然后约付首付，又是两个选择
1 付首付。2 放弃 损失定金。
所以等同于还是只有一个选择。
我印象里付完首付，才签的合同，记不太清了。
当时宣传的是房子当年年底就可以交房，我们也是被这个吸引的。
实际签合同时，在未有任何通知的情况下，合同上的交房时间比宣传的延期了 7 个月。
这时候同样两个选择，1 签合同，2 扯皮，大概率亏钱。
毕竟定金，首付都交了，贼船已经上了。
所以实际上，等同于还是只有一个选择。
然后交房时间比合同上的还要延期，实际晚了一年半。
哦 对了 当时还新实行了一个政策，大意就是不卖毛坯了，卖精装修，合同上装修价格是每平米两千多。
也是没法反对的。
还能咋样呢，继续签字呗。
二 收房
当时花了两百多，请了个验房师。
人家倒也算敬业，大大小小便利贴，贴了一屋子。
什么空鼓，裂缝，锁装反了，比比皆是。
最搞笑的是，燃气热水器孤零零的挂在那，居然接不到燃气管。
然后呢 报备到开发商，
偶尔才有下文。
有些改了，大部分不了了之。
同样，业主一点办法都没有。
看似有选择，实则无选择。
不收房，房子也是你的，问题也还是存在的，我有邻居三年没收房，里面的门还是没装的。
只能先住着吧。
三 住房
三个字，质量差。
今天这里坏，明天那里坏。
电梯不到一年，就频繁的关人，或者维修。
洗脸池，睡前还好好的，起床发现洗脸池掉地上了。
有个业主很委屈的在群里说，“你们啥时候来给我修灯啊，我都摸黑半年了”。
最大的槽点是隔音，极其的差。
楼上，楼上的楼上，楼下的走路说话唱歌，我都可以听到。
我的房子里就像恐怖片一样，明明就我一个人，能听到一大家子的声音，
身临其境。
有走路的，有放东西的，有大喊的，有跑步的，有关门的，
此起彼伏，热闹非凡。
偏偏我楼上素质极差，十岁大的小孩，三年学不会穿拖鞋，大人放任不管。大人七点吵架，摔东西。
沟通过，讲道理过，吵架过，反击过，甚至想过同归于尽，
不胜其烦。
当时还是限售，想卖都卖不掉，我是生生的被折磨了几年。
最后限售过了，很多原因叠加，决定卖了。
四 卖房
现在卖房的情况是，不管你装修，不管你户型，不管你楼层，不管你的任何附加价值，只看小区的近期成交价。
这肯定是不合理的，
因为就算你去买猪肉，还得分前腿和五花，不同部位的价格肯定不同。
所以个人感觉这种情况不会持续太久。
中介，很不专业，房屋信息都能讲错，只会不停的劝你降价。
（我的房子挂的价格是很公道的，贝壳评分也很高，并没有挂高价）
甚至出现过疑似虚假带看的行为。
有一个很假的客户，他走后我就知道，第二天中介肯定要来报价，果然报价了。
签约，合同是统一的模板，但感觉对卖方的保障不够到位，
比如如果因为买家问题，导致贷款批不下来，最后终止合同，默认选项是定金返还。
这就不合理，要不然要定金干嘛呢。
如果有卖房的朋友，可以关注下这里。
卖房流程还有一个坑点，首先每个地方的流程和政策是不一样的，可能我说的，其他地方是不存在的。
买家拿到新房产证后，需要去抵押，然后银行放款。
这里的坑点就是，如果买家不去抵押，选择了取消贷款，房子已经过户了，你尾款收不到。
我不知道其他的地方是怎么保障这一块的。
我去问过银行，他们说，买家是可以取消贷款的，银行不能阻止，也不会通知卖家。
我也网上查过，有地方是发生过这种 zha 骗的。
如果买家确实要买，那就没问题，如果别有用心，就很难说。
所以我当时还是焦虑了两天，还好收到钱了。
综上，这就是我从买到卖的经历。
如果踩几个坑，那也许是我运气不好。
如果每一步都踩了坑，我想不会全是因为我衰。
反正经历了这一切，我是不太想买房子了，至少不买新房。
唉 其实房子卖了，还是有点舍不得的，折磨了我这么久，但我也投入了这么多精力和感情。
现在无车无房无债，有存款。
希望开始新的生活。]]></summary>

我才想起来我之前遇到的一件事情：
十年前办宽带，光猫支付了设备费，并且开具了发票。不是押金那种。
办完宽带我就直接把光猫改成了桥接，tr069 忘记删了。
过了几年突然有一天家里断网了好几天，我不在家，家人报了维修，装维上门调了很久才修好。
后来我看电视发现看不了打电话问，装维让我把网线插路由器上互联网用。
又过了几年我登录光猫后台，发现超密被改了！ iptv 的 vlan 被删了！
现在我才明白，移动远程改了 [我个人资产光猫] 的超密，同时把桥接改成了拨号，导致我家断网，维修的过程中改回了桥接又把 iptv 给删了，导致我家看不了电视。
大家评评理，这算不算入侵个人关键基础设施信息系统罪？！]]></summary>

目前是放的一台 55 寸落地电视，买了有接近 5 年，想换一台大点的，网上看了目前 85 寸左右的电视机，长度接近 1.9 ，这样整面墙都是电视会不会有点不太协调，在纠结是上 85 寸还是 75 寸，75 寸差不多长度是 1.65 上下，感觉这个尺寸还可以，然后换新电视肯定是壁挂到墙上，墙是实体墙。
最后就是品牌的选择，初步是看了 TCL 的 Q10K 系列和华为 Vision 智慧屏 4 pro 发现 85 寸和 75 寸价格差价还是挺大的，求大佬指点一二。电视主要是用来看电视、综艺，小孩子看动画片。
