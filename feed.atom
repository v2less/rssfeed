        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all, I just want to share my experience with Linux so far.
 I installed Ubuntu some days ago and I'm incredibly surprised on how good my experience has been, even in the gaming side.
 For some reason I couldn't get Linux Mint to work, so I decided to go with Ubuntu, and for the last three days I've been testing a lot of games I have on my Steam Library and the experience has been great, out of the box most of the games are working as good as on Windows, even games like NFS Unbound (I'm really surprised for this one, for some reason I thought this one wasn't going to work)
 I'm keeping Windows on a dual boot as there are some apps that I want to keep there and maybe to go back to a game that doesn't work on Ubuntu (like Horizon Zero Dawn, for some reason is not working) but I think I will use Linux from now on as my daily driver.
 I hope the future will be even brighter

 AutoPilot is a free-to-use, well documented bash script (for both Debian and RHEL related operating systems) written by me meant to automate the process of setting up a new system.

 It uses YAML for its configuration file, so it is very easy to set up, and you can create numerous configuration files for different occasions. (I like to call them "Profiles" 🙃)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello, everyone!
My name is Alex, and I'm an expat in a new country. Two years ago, I moved to Germany where I didn’t know anyone. Starting the job, I realized that becoming close friends with colleagues can be quite challenging and slow. The feeling of loneliness was gradually growing.
To change that, I started attending various meetups based on my interests, hoping to make new friends. However, I often found myself answering the same generic questions that didn’t really help me understand if someone shared my values and interests. As a result, lost energy and 0 friends.
SO - That’s when I began using icebreaking questions in smaller groups. Surprisingly, these questions quickly changed any conversation to a deeper, more engaging and meaningful level. I was able to identify people I genuinely connected with and started spending more time with them.
BUT - preparing and using these questions was a pain. I would Google the top-100, pick a random number, and choose a question. I felt a strong need for a simple „one button“ that does everything for me.
AND - After searching and not finding such a solution, I decided to build it myself. I created a vast database of questions across various topics and integrated AI to generate questions on any subject.
The idea has resonated well within my communities (university and expat parties), and more people are starting to use it. I’d love to hear your stories with icebreaking questions, your experience, and your feedback so I can make the service even more useful for more people!
Check it out and share your thoughts!

 I start my terminal and use the task "pulseaudio -k"
 After this the issue is solved till the next reboot.
 I wasn't able to find a better solution at my own. Someone here, who knows the problem and has the solution?

On my MacBook Pro, I use Self Control to block food delivery websites, but I have no way of temporarily blocking apps. On my new computer I would like to completely block food delivery sites, and temporarily block certain social media and apps from opening when they are distracting. It's important that the blocks are not simple to undo. I'd prefer to use an app, not just the command line. 
 Thanks, and sorry if this is the wrong subreddit.

Why we’re doing this: Mechanical engineers excel at generating initial design concepts but get bogged down translating ideas into final designs due to tedious, repetitive tasks. Our goal is to automate these mundane processes, allowing engineers to focus on the creative aspects of design.
Having worked at multiple hardware companies—from medical devices to space launch vehicles—we know how often “trivial” components such as manufacturing rigging, get brushed under the table in scheduling conversations.  These tasks aren’t necessari…]]></summary>

It has panning, zooming, and dragging elements around. The settings closely follow html/css. We think an open canvas is a big improvement over other website builders. Everything is easier: styling, consistency, responsiveness…
But making it work was hard! We thought HN would appreciate the tech behind it:
- A custom WebGL rendering engine (w/text, shadows, blurs, gradients, & opacity groups)
- A partial implementation of the css spec
- A custom text editor & text shaper
- A transformer to turn designs into publishable html/css
Repaint is a design tool for html/css. But internally, it doesn’t actually use html/css itself. All your designs live in a single  element.

浏览器主用过 Via 和 Firefox,就算加锁+省电策略无限制也避免不了锁屏重启。最搞笑的是，这个重启会重放浏览器冷启动的动作，例如系统开机后通过别的 APP 跳转浏览器打开了 B 站，那么之后每次浏览器被热重启都会重复打开一次 B 站，除非设置里把浏览器彻底关掉。我都不知道是不是系统 bug 。

But I'm thinking of changing client since HexChat is abandonware at this point, and I'm facing a problem with HexChat's font rendering on Linux, which could totally be a distro-specific thing.
 I'd like some suggestions on which new IRC client to migrate to, and would like to avoid CLI-based clients. One GUI client that I've tried is Konversation, which has a nice GUI but is considerably less extensive in terms of features compared to HexChat.

免费版的 CF 可以挡住一些攻击，但是如果攻击者加强攻势，CF5 秒盾依然挡不住。这时候升级付费版是否有用？
看了阮一峰的 ddos 文章，还有搞镜像服务器的套路来防； ddos 的攻击成本是多少？今天半天打我的流量看了一下，有几百 G ，难道不用钱吗？因为我的站并没有收益，所以我暂时没花钱来做防护。]]></summary>

I plan to add more restriction-enzyme-based features in the near future. It has some extras like a solution-mixing helper, automatic feature annotation.
From a technical standpoint, this is a standalone binary written using the EGUI library in rust. A project goal is performance, with small memory footprint, and small application and file sizes.
This is a continuous work-in-progress, and I'm open to any and all feedback, criticism, and requested features.

        <id>https://www.v2ex.com/t/1070024#reply8</id>
        <link href="https://www.v2ex.com/t/1070024#reply8"/>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[房子卖掉了，亏了小几万，可以接受，就当买个教训。
以后都不敢把希望寄托在邻居的素质上了。当然还有新房的质量上了。
把从买到卖，盘点一下，才发现一路走来，真的一步一坑。
一 买房
当时还是限购， 需要摇号。
我家就一个人有资格，
摇中后， 两个选择：
1 付定金 2w 。  2 放弃购买，半年内无资格参与摇号
当时只有样板间，也没什么好参考的，
所以除非有特别原因 等同于只能选 1 。
然后约付首付，又是两个选择
1 付首付。2 放弃 损失定金。
所以等同于还是只有一个选择。
我印象里付完首付，才签的合同，记不太清了。
当时宣传的是房子当年年底就可以交房，我们也是被这个吸引的。
实际签合同时，在未有任何通知的情况下，合同上的交房时间比宣传的延期了 7 个月。
这时候同样两个选择，1 签合同，2 扯皮，大概率亏钱。
毕竟定金，首付都交了，贼船已经上了。
所以实际上，等同于还是只有一个选择。
然后交房时间比合同上的还要延期，实际晚了一年半。
哦 对了 当时还新实行了一个政策，大意就是不卖毛坯了，卖精装修，合同上装修价格是每平米两千多。
也是没法反对的。
还能咋样呢，继续签字呗。
二 收房
当时花了两百多，请了个验房师。
人家倒也算敬业，大大小小便利贴，贴了一屋子。
什么空鼓，裂缝，锁装反了，比比皆是。
最搞笑的是，燃气热水器孤零零的挂在那，居然接不到燃气管。
然后呢 报备到开发商，
偶尔才有下文。
有些改了，大部分不了了之。
同样，业主一点办法都没有。
看似有选择，实则无选择。
不收房，房子也是你的，问题也还是存在的，我有邻居三年没收房，里面的门还是没装的。
只能先住着吧。
三 住房
三个字，质量差。
今天这里坏，明天那里坏。
电梯不到一年，就频繁的关人，或者维修。
洗脸池，睡前还好好的，起床发现洗脸池掉地上了。
有个业主很委屈的在群里说，“你们啥时候来给我修灯啊，我都摸黑半年了”。
最大的槽点是隔音，极其的差。
楼上，楼上的楼上，楼下的走路说话唱歌，我都可以听到。
我的房子里就像恐怖片一样，明明就我一个人，能听到一大家子的声音，
身临其境。
有走路的，有放东西的，有大喊的，有跑步的，有关门的，
此起彼伏，热闹非凡。
偏偏我楼上素质极差，十岁大的小孩，三年学不会穿拖鞋，大人放任不管。大人七点吵架，摔东西。
沟通过，讲道理过，吵架过，反击过，甚至想过同归于尽，
不胜其烦。
当时还是限售，想卖都卖不掉，我是生生的被折磨了几年。
最后限售过了，很多原因叠加，决定卖了。
四 卖房
现在卖房的情况是，不管你装修，不管你户型，不管你楼层，不管你的任何附加价值，只看小区的近期成交价。
这肯定是不合理的，
因为就算你去买猪肉，还得分前腿和五花，不同部位的价格肯定不同。
所以个人感觉这种情况不会持续太久。
中介，很不专业，房屋信息都能讲错，只会不停的劝你降价。
（我的房子挂的价格是很公道的，贝壳评分也很高，并没有挂高价）
甚至出现过疑似虚假带看的行为。
有一个很假的客户，他走后我就知道，第二天中介肯定要来报价，果然报价了。
签约，合同是统一的模板，但感觉对卖方的保障不够到位，
比如如果因为买家问题，导致贷款批不下来，最后终止合同，默认选项是定金返还。
这就不合理，要不然要定金干嘛呢。
如果有卖房的朋友，可以关注下这里。
卖房流程还有一个坑点，首先每个地方的流程和政策是不一样的，可能我说的，其他地方是不存在的。
买家拿到新房产证后，需要去抵押，然后银行放款。
这里的坑点就是，如果买家不去抵押，选择了取消贷款，房子已经过户了，你尾款收不到。
我不知道其他的地方是怎么保障这一块的。
我去问过银行，他们说，买家是可以取消贷款的，银行不能阻止，也不会通知卖家。
我也网上查过，有地方是发生过这种 zha 骗的。
如果买家确实要买，那就没问题，如果别有用心，就很难说。
所以我当时还是焦虑了两天，还好收到钱了。
综上，这就是我从买到卖的经历。
如果踩几个坑，那也许是我运气不好。
如果每一步都踩了坑，我想不会全是因为我衰。
反正经历了这一切，我是不太想买房子了，至少不买新房。
唉 其实房子卖了，还是有点舍不得的，折磨了我这么久，但我也投入了这么多精力和感情。
现在无车无房无债，有存款。
希望开始新的生活。]]></summary>

我才想起来我之前遇到的一件事情：
十年前办宽带，光猫支付了设备费，并且开具了发票。不是押金那种。
办完宽带我就直接把光猫改成了桥接，tr069 忘记删了。
过了几年突然有一天家里断网了好几天，我不在家，家人报了维修，装维上门调了很久才修好。
后来我看电视发现看不了打电话问，装维让我把网线插路由器上互联网用。
又过了几年我登录光猫后台，发现超密被改了！ iptv 的 vlan 被删了！
现在我才明白，移动远程改了 [我个人资产光猫] 的超密，同时把桥接改成了拨号，导致我家断网，维修的过程中改回了桥接又把 iptv 给删了，导致我家看不了电视。
大家评评理，这算不算入侵个人关键基础设施信息系统罪？！]]></summary>

目前是放的一台 55 寸落地电视，买了有接近 5 年，想换一台大点的，网上看了目前 85 寸左右的电视机，长度接近 1.9 ，这样整面墙都是电视会不会有点不太协调，在纠结是上 85 寸还是 75 寸，75 寸差不多长度是 1.65 上下，感觉这个尺寸还可以，然后换新电视肯定是壁挂到墙上，墙是实体墙。
最后就是品牌的选择，初步是看了 TCL 的 Q10K 系列和华为 Vision 智慧屏 4 pro 发现 85 寸和 75 寸价格差价还是挺大的，求大佬指点一二。电视主要是用来看电视、综艺，小孩子看动画片。
刚好广东有补贴。]]></summary>

所以我用 ChatGPT 生成了 20 篇 Markdown 文章，尽量确保这些文章用到足够多的特性以及包含可能的特殊情况。本仓库已置入公共领域，可以随意使用。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[hello,
 I keep a diary, a very long text file and Linux is wonderful with its scripting abilities for support of it. For example I have a scripts like "open the diary on the last page so I can write today's entry" "insert a header with current date and day of the week for current entry" "insert a fortune cookie message of the day taken from the fortune(6) application" "open the diary on a pseudo-random page so I can reflect the past" (this is better than opening a paper diary on a pseudo-random page because you don't involve whether it will be entry from the beginning of the diary or the end) 
 all this is done by combining the command line switches and ":r!" commands in Vim with custom Perl scripts. I don't know how much it will take to make something like that on WIndows, you will probably have to create your own application in Delphi which is cumbersome. 
 tried to post this to r/linuxmasterrace but they don't allow text posts, I guess it is OK here, since it involves Linux and Linux is praised

My only real experience has been with mint so far (i’d heard good things about it and liked it aesthetically), and i’ve been absolutely loving it. 
 Thing is, i’ve since heard a lot of people also saying it isn’t that great, and I want to know exactly why. The only thing i’ve heard specifically is packages being outdated, but I don’t know specifically what problems that causes/entails, and it sounds like people have other grievances that I haven’t seen explained. 
 Basically, I want a technical rundown of why exactly some of you may not recommend mint, what issues I may face, or what drawbacks it have that I may not have noticed from my limited sample size.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[PostgreSQL 是一个功能强大的开源对象关系数据库管理系统(ORDBMS)，它从伯克利写的 POSTGRES 软件包发展而来（1995 年几个 UCB 的学生为 Post-Ingres 开发了 SQL 的接口，正式发布了 PostgreSQL95，随后一步步在开源社区中成长起来），经过十几年的发展， PostgreSQL 已经成为世界上发展最快最受欢迎的数据库系统之一。
本文章主要介绍在 CentOS 下源码编码安装 PostgreSQL-10.0 的一些简单步骤，以供参考。
1. 新增用户组及用户
PostgreSQL 默认是通过 postgres:postgres 来启动和使用的，因此在安装 PostgreSQL 前需要先创建 postgres 用户组及 postgres 用户。
# 在root权限下进行
groupadd postgres                    # 添加postgres用户组
useradd postgres -g postgres         # 添加postgres用户
passwd postgres                      # 设置postgres用户密码

2. postgresql 安装
$ wget https://ftp.postgresql.org/pub/source/v10.0/postgresql-10.0.tar.gz
$ tar zvxf postgresql-10.0.tar.gz
$ cd postgresql-10.0
$ ./configure --prefix=/data/softwares/pgsql
$ make
$ make install

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I finally found a fix and wanted to share it:
  
Go to settings > Apps, show all apps / include system apps
 Find "3 Buttons Navigation Bar", Tap it
 Disable auto-remove permissions after inactivity
 Set battery-optimization to "unrestricted"
 Disable open-links
  
EDIT: Oh forgot the last steps:
  
Find SystemUI
 
Disable Open-links
 
Battery mode "restricted"
 
Find your phone's custom launcher
 
Disable Open links
 
Battery mode "restricted"
 
 It at least makes the system more stable from the quick-succession taps of the right-most navigation button, only after wake-up from a longer time it overwhelms the system still. But this is definitely an improvement.

 Because desktop Linux has steadily gained a larger following in the last 10+ years, and thankfully there’s no signs of that stopping or slowing down, I want to make a post about ways we can keep this trend going. While its true “The Year of the Linux Desktop” has always been a meme or in-joke in the community, its possible that will finally start to change in the next decade.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[On Debian-based distros, when an app is available as a DEB or an AppImage (that doesn't self-update), but no APT repository, PPA or Flatpak, the only option is to manually download each update, and usually manually check even whether there are updates.
 But, what if those would be upgraded at the same time as everything else using the tools you're familiar with ?
 dynapt is a local web server that fetches those DEBs (and AppImages to be wrapped into DEBs) wherever those are, then serves these to APT like any package repository does.
 I started building it a few months ago, and after using it to upgrade apps on my computers and servers for some time, I pre-released it for the first time yesterday.

 Experimental tutorial
  
The stable version will come with CLI wizard to avoid this configuration.
 Feedback is welcome :)

更恶心的是，关闭 VSCode 之后（尤其是用 SSH 连接的情况下），这一两个吃满 CPU 的进程并不会退出，而是一直在那吃，如果这时再重新打开 VSCode ，特别是打开另一个 workspace ，然后又会多一两个进程在那 CPU100%...
这个有办法缓解吗，比如至少配置什么让 VSCode 关闭之后能让这进程消失，或者当没有打开的 C/C++代码（ VSCode 还在运行）的时候停止索引，等等。
不想直接禁用 C/C++插件，因为平时打开小项目还是会用到的。]]></summary>

 In fact, the only place I've been able to find them other than medium articles and YouTube videos is the alpine wiki:
 https://wiki.alpinelinux.org/wiki/Dwm
 I was wondering - are the DWM dependencies listed anywhere in the suckless documentation? It seems a bit odd that such basic info isn't more readily accessible.

 I know Google's got a stranglehold on the market, but I'm curious - would you use an open-source search engine if it prioritized privacy, transparency, community involvement, and user control? What features would you want to see?
 I like some of the features that Kagi are implementing but they're not open source.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello HN, I'm pythonbrad and a core maintainer of Afrim - an input method engine for African languages.
Afrim want to simplify the typing in African languages and also digitalize the African typing systems. Basically, it wants to solve the problems encountered with current solutions:
- slow typing
- not easily configurable
- keyboard layout dependent
- constant bugs
Additionally, Afrim offers the following features [1]:
- Dataset easily customizable
- Keyboard layout independent
- Auto completion, autocorrection and autosuggestion
- Support all sequential codes
Technical details [2]:
Afrim is written in Rust and his architecture is inspired of RIME.
What's next?
- Offer an android frontend of the Afrim (in development) [3]
- Support more African input methods as possible
I would like to have your opinions about this project. I have been working on it so far, and I would like to know how I can improve it.

现在有机会可以尝试一下其它方向，目前在考虑编译器开发或调试器等工具链开发。请问这个方向未来前景怎么样，能不能更有把握度过中年失业危机，以及会不会太小众很难找工作呢？
麻烦大佬们帮忙指点一二。]]></summary>

There’s a demo here: https://www.loom.com/share/761cac3090ba4db8b2ce9d713873333a?..., as well as a walkthrough of our Python SDK: https://www.loom.com/share/c4b3f95235e24d99a7ea571c4564602b
YC initially funded us for AI web-scraping, but early in the batch we realized we wanted to pivot to something in data privacy - in some ways the opposite of web-scraping…
From talking with SaaS developers, we learned tenant isolation (making sure one customer’s data is not shown to another) is often considered in development but rarely a core competen…]]></summary>

運營商簽約帶寬為下行 1000M 上行 50M ，正常情況下都能跑滿。
使用一段時間後，當一台設備在下載時（限速 300M ），理論上不影響其他設備上網，但其他設備感覺延遲會很大，但速度不算慢，表現為轉圈數秒，然後瞬間全部加載出來，停止下載只使用單一設備時稍好但仍然感覺延遲很大，測速下行跌到 500-600Mbps 左右，上行只有 1-5Mbps ，測速曲線明顯不正常，從幾十 KB 開始慢慢爬升上去，或者上下劇烈起伏。有線無線同樣問題，唯有重啟方可恢復正常，週而復始。
路由器韌體為最新 3.0.0.6.102.33921 ，網內大概 30 多台設備
不知是路由設定問題還是運營商的問題？請教各位專家

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Since back when Ryzen was released there was a great hype surrounding their better efficiency, multi core performance and Linux compatibility, which of course is less problematic than NVIDIA with their closed source driverd, but Intel was definitely stagnant with their product lineups. 
 I bought into it and my last 3 laptop purchases were AMD only laptops precisely for believing they would provide the best Linux experience. Within this time-frame I used mostly openSUSE Tumbleweed and the latest Fedora.
 Well, the first laptop died within 3 years, and had some weird CPU spikes, and resume from suspend was hit or miss. Also I had to deal with broadcom drivers constantly breaking with kernel updates.
 The second laptop had frequent freezes causing the session to hang and require cold reboots. I tried several solutions and kernel parameters but the issue remained to this day. 
 The third laptop, with RX dGPU, constantly flickers when connecting to a external FreeSync 144hz display.
 My most recent purchase was finally a Intel laptop with Xe graphics (LG Gram), and behold, I have none of these issues at all. Wayland, suspend and resume, external displays, battery runtime equal to Windows, all works great. It might be just luck with this particular model but honestly it made me regret my past purchases.
 Since then I have learned more about Intel active and timely contributions to the Linux kernel and I am hoping the layoffs won't cause that to decrease.
 Either Intel has been improving a lot these last few years or AMD has been overhyped, but the hassle free experience with a Intel laptop has made me hesitant with going to AMD+NVIDIA on my next desktop build, I am Seriously considering going with Intel CPU+Arc GPU.

        <id>https://www.v2ex.com/t/1069736#reply1</id>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[使用了一段时间的 Dhizuku ，在自己的网站写了一篇水文，全文如下，权当抛砖引玉，欢迎大佬们不吝赐教。
如果把 Android 手机比喻为一栋房屋，那么解锁 Bootloader 后，你才真正拥有了这座房屋的“所有权”而非“使用权”；而诸如 Dhizuku / Shizuku 这类免解锁玩机工具则更像是与房东“扯皮”来获得更多对房屋装修的“支配权”，虽然有种戴着脚铐跳舞的妥协感，但是在部分场景下足矣。
解锁玩机已经愈发困难，折腾需求依然存在
由于众所周知的原因，手机厂商对于用户的“折腾”、“玩机”行为不断限制，解锁 Bootloader 的难度与日俱增，就看看小米 BL 解锁答题裸考下面的热门评论吧：
KernelSU 作者 weishu 在小米解锁 bootloader 考试中获得了 30 分的好成绩 你也快来试试吧!
小米“高考”果然名不虚传！
当然，忽略“房间里的大象”而直接指责手机厂商固然不妥，但是厂商的一些“流氓行径”着实令人不爽。那么如果跳过成本愈发高昂的解锁，我们是否还能实现一些玩机需求？比如绕过烦人的官方安装器，使用更方便的第三方安装器？
Shizuku —— 巧借 adb ，获取更高的权限玩机
根据 Shizuku 官网 和 GitHub 主页 上面的介绍，开发者将其定义为“让你的应用直接使用系统 API”的工具，其最大亮点就在主页上的“支持 adb 使用”，也就是“如果你的「需要 root 的应用」只需要 adb 权限，则可以使用 Shizuku 轻松地扩大用户群体。”
虽然对于大多数玩机发烧友已经是陈词滥调，但是还是援引一下Android 调试桥 (adb) - Android Developers上面的定义：Android 调试桥 (adb) 是一种功能多样的命令行工具，可让您与设备进行通信。adb 命令可用于执行各种设备操作，例如安装和调试应用…]]></summary>

https://wiki.0xffff.one/getting-started/
主要是针对我过去学计算机到工作的困惑，与身边人的观念冲突，和身边朋友数年来的摸索之间，一步步想通后的一个方法总结。
形式上是一系列文章，整体比较务实和行动导向。主要讨论大学与中小学学习、以及不同大学之间的异同；在心态上如何平衡学校 title 的落差，从中小学填鸭教育过渡到大学的主动学习的策略；还有 CS 领域入门的一些关注点，关于个人电脑开发环境，知识管理体系的准备，以及最早期 Overview 的搭建等等。
这里也是 0xFFFF CS Wiki 的一部分，Wiki 本身除了这一系列指引外，其他内容目前还及其简陋，所以也希望可以吸纳一些新鲜血液一起来交流，沉淀一些东西。不知不觉我毕业也有好几年，自觉已经很难再从学生的视角去思考一些问题了😄]]></summary>

暑假结束了，天气凉快了，孩子终于要开学了。
8 月数据总结
最近一个多月都在全身心在新 App 上，所有的在架 App 都没有任何打理。
总得来看，下载量提升很多，App Store 和 Google Play 的收入没什么变化，但是国内安卓市场的收入大幅减少。
下载量（极简时钟）
App Store ，增长 44%
Google Play ，增长 19.30%
国内安卓市场，因为上个月的数据不全，就和 6 月份对比，增长了 18.7%
收入变化
App Store ，增长 2.2%
Google Play ，增长 9.08%
Admob ，增长 0.28%
国内安卓市场，减少 18.92%
Ship-A-Ton 第三周
Ship-A-Ton 就剩 18 天了，感觉要砍掉一个大功能才能勉强提交了。
这周严重阻碍开发进度的就是黑神话·悟空！。每天都会玩到后半夜一点多，这就导致睡眠不足，严重影响到了白天的开发效率。
这周的番茄钟数量是 26 ，相比上周多了 4 个， 但也只是 4 个而已。开发速度太慢了，这让我又开始焦虑了。

这周有两个主要的进展，一是完成了第三个功能模块的原型，跑通了整个流程。这个模块经历了两次更名，一开始叫 Wishlist ，再后来叫 Goals ，最后定为 Desires 。
另一个进展就是和设计师顺利达成了合作，App 的 UI 终于有保证了。这一周的绝大部分开发时间都花在了 UI 上，和我之前自己瞎写的 UI 一对比，简直是云泥之别。专业的事情还是要交给专业的人来做。
[Vlog: Week 3 for Shipaton]
本周探索
监测 ScrollView 滚动状态
需要在新 App 里加入对 ScrollView 滚动状态的监测，看完了肘子哥的文章，# 如何判断 ScrollView 、List 是否正在滚动中。因为 App 是 iOS 17+ 的，还不能直接使用 iOS 18 的新 API ， 直接就使用了肘子哥的 IsScrolling 。
单复数的文案本地化
App 里需要用的针对单词单复数的不同文案，所以就第一次使用了 SwiftUI 中 Text 对单复数的 API ，不用自己写 if else 判断，很优雅。# Pluralisation made simpler in SwiftUI
SVG 转成 SF Symbols
我想要把 MasterGo/Figma 里面的切图导出后，放到 Xcode 中，然后通过 Image 和 foregroundStyle 给切图加上不同的颜色，就像 SF Symbols 那样。导出成 jpg 和 png 都无法做到，尝试导出 SVG 后才发现 SwiftUI 的 Image 还不支持 SVG 。
我就想着怎么能把 SVG 转成 SF Symbols ，找了两个工具 App ，都是收费的，连试用也没有，我就没敢直接付费。于是我就问了下 ChatGPT 怎么将 SVG 转换成 SF Symbols ，AI 的回答如下：

我就在这个回答里找到了解决方案：PDF ！将 icon 导出为 PDF ，放到 Xcode 的 Asset 里，然后将图片设置为 Render as Template Image 就可以了。
生活
吃了两顿大餐，还发现了一家不错的面馆。
和许久没见的老同学见面，畅聊一晚。

直面天命，刚过第五回，下周肯定能通关了。
第三回，黄眉差一点初见过，我以为还有一个阶段变身，当时葫芦也没酒了，就摆烂打了。
第四回，晦月魔君确实恶心，我是天命人，不是修脚师傅！
第五回，死的最多次数居然是在铁球山路……

最近因为玩游戏和写代码，尤克里里都生疏了，每天练习时间大大减少，甚至有一两天都没拿起来。花了将近一个月练习 Em 和弦终于成功了，录了 New Boy 。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[最近把五年前写的一个弹幕库给重构了一下，本来两年前就想着做这件事，但是其中有一段工作时间压力很大，所以就搁置了，导致没有时间来做这件事情，最近周末 + 晚上花一些时间重构了下，并把文档好好写了一下。言归正传，这篇文章会介绍部分这个弹幕库有的能力，如果正好符合你的需求或者感兴趣，可以帮忙点点 star 来支持一下。
我们有哪些能力
我们提供了灵活调整轨道，自定义弹幕和容器样式，弹幕运动算法等能力，还在提供非常丰富的钩子来让用户处理自定义的行为，只要你想要的，都能做到，本文档会简单介绍一些能力和一些功能的实现。
在线 demo: https://imtaotao.github.io/danmu/
github: https://github.com/imtaotao/danmu?tab=readme-ov-file
官方文档： https://imtaotao.github.io/danmu/document/zh/
快速开始
对于一个开箱即用的 demo ，可以非常简单的接入，如下所示：
import { create } from 'danmu';

const manager = create();

manager.mount('#root');
manager.startPlaying();

// 发送弹幕
manager.push('弹幕内容')

对轨道进行调整
我们对支持类似 CSS calc 表达式的能力，一些位置/宽高等信息都可以用表达式来计算。所以对于轨道来说可以很方便的进行调整。
**number**：默认单位为 px。
**string**：表达式计算。支持（+, -, *, /）数学计算，只支持 % 和 px 两种单位。
// 例如，这里的 100% 是指容器宽度（如果是高度相关的配置 100%  就是容器的高度）
manager.setGap('…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[一、汇丰旺角分行
材料：
1.身份类：身份证，通行证，过境小票
2.地址证明，收入明细证明，个税 app
流程：
提前约到了 30 号下午 4：00 的号，15：47 才能刷二维码。刷码等叫号，查看身份证，通行证，过境小票，地址证明，收入明细，通过个税 app 查看工作单位。按步填写信息全拼音，签名用中文即可，电话号码用内地号码。询问带了多少现金，我说 1w 多，存了 1.1w ，给卡，提醒要当天内在 atm 改密，初始密码在白色回单上。接着我询问是否有 mastercard ，对方不明白，但后来帮我申请了扣款卡。再接着问能否申请信用卡，回答说信用卡对内地人已停办。后来回住处后，自己在网上申请了，不确定能否申请成功。
二、中银香港牛头角分行(不建议预约这家分行)
提前 7 天预约了 31 号 9：00 的号，没办法，预约时网页卡顿，最后只好选了这家分行。人流量不大，但 8：30 到，门口也有长者在排队了。虽然不记得在哪个地方看到说这家分行不能当场下卡，但想着既然预约到了，那就碰下运气吧！
1.材料：和汇丰银行旺角分行准备的一样，但还要求有近三个月的理财账户持仓和收支明细，也就因为这个材料没有，线下开卡失败。即便我说我有 A 股几年前的交易，并给对方查看了。对方还说不能是截图。
2.线上开户：
(1)要求：肉身过港，手机过港。
(2)材料：移民局小程序过境信息 pdf 文档，通行证，身份证。
(3)人脸识别比较坑，8 秒钟，3 个动作。
(4)拍证件不能过亮反光。
(5)实体卡邮寄到家，平邮。
(6)资料可用全简体中文。
3.线上开户弊端：
(1)转数快小额支付没问题。
(2)中银快汇等其他投资交易类业务没法办理，相当于内地开了张 II 类卡的感觉。联系客服说，要再次到任意分行提交身份证件，提供账户，签字印鉴，才能使用全功能。(只能看哪天会不会再过港了)
三、ZAbank
1.虚拟卡，开户流程和中银香港差不多，同样肉身过港，手机过港。
2.要求：除了身份证、通行证、移民局小程序过境信息 pdf 文件信息外，还要内地银行卡和内地手机号参与验证信息，并且这张银行卡预留的手机号码要和 ZAbank 开户手机号一致。
3.5 个工作日反馈开卡结果。
PS:移民局小程序建议不用 hotmail 接收。不管是 hkt 的网络，还是我用 csl 或者 ctmo 数据打开都有问题，页面卡顿，点不开邮件，借助 tw 的梯子打开了邮件，但下不了附件，那会真是着急。也许是我的 iphone13safari 问题吧。最后重新发到 qq 邮箱解决问题。手机上有 qq 邮箱 app ，但是 qq 邮箱代收 hotmail 好像也有问题，不及时或者被 hotmail 风控。
最后，这次到香港，去了油麻地果栏(水果批发也不便宜啊)，ifc ，港大(最近学校活动周末也要预约，拖个行李箱转悠真的把自己累到了)，圆方(港大到圆方好近，就是中环内部换乘很远)。每次都是经西九龙高铁过港，但还是第一次去圆方，感觉比 ifc ，海港城，崇光铜锣湾，时代广场，太古广场都要好逛一些的感觉。当然每次去到香港都会去星光大道拍维港日景和夜景。话说近几年汇率高企，买买买也没有之前划算了，再加上各大品牌为了盈利也提高了在香港的销售价格，也没那么大优惠了。]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[各位使用成都、四川移动地区专线的 V 友们，请关注自己专线的网络状况：
  由于打压 PCDN ，从 2024.9.1 日下午 16：00 以后，成都地区移动出现了只要有上传流量（流速>10mbps ）,会出现到网关的高 ping 、跳包现象。同时上传速度仅仅只有正常速度的 10/1 。
  我这里已经有两条专线中招，有一条日均上传很高（作用于网盘备份、同步），而另外一条日均上传不过 5-15G ，一个月下下上行流量不过 137G 。
现在的情况就是：下行可以跑满合同限速，ping 不丢包，只要测速开始测试上传，并且速率>10m ，到第一跳网关将出现高 ping 导致整个网络连接质量极差，停止上传后网络会立即恢复正常。
tips：1 、这些都是固定 IP 的专线，不是家宽；
      2 、最开始我还认为只针对高上传用户，结果低上传用户也被一锅端了。
      3 、不跑 PCDN 、PT ，不要拿跑 PCDN 被收拾来幸灾乐祸。这个 QOS 策略纯纯傻逼。
      大家对照一下检查一下专线的情况把

前天突然发现无法通过 https 访问 cdn.a.com。http 访问则没有问题。直接 https 访问源站 b.com 也没有问题。
openssl s_client -connect cdn.a.com:443 -showcerts 检查发现没有证书：
CONNECTED(00000003)
登录 cf 后台，在 [网站]  [ SSL/TLS ]  [边缘证书] 页面中，边缘证书列表显示为无证书：

我已检查过：
[ SSL/TLS ] 被设置为完整（严格）。
没有开启 [始终使用 HTTPS ] 。确保续签时可通过 http 访问校验文件。
[安全性]  [ WAF ] 中已设置规则，放行对校验文件的访问。
外部 DNS 解析服务中 cdn.a.com 通过 cname 指向官方指定的 cdn.a.com.cdn.cloudflare.net。
curl http://cdn.a.com/.well-known/pki-validation/caxxxxx.txt 可以得到预设的值。
我已试过如下方法但都没有效果：
cf 后台暂停该域名，一小时后重启。
[ SSL/TLS ] 调整为关闭，一小时后恢复为完整（严格）。
[ SSL/TLS ] 调整为关闭，一小时后恢复为完整。
[边缘证书] 中关闭 [通用 SSL ] ，一小时后启用。
按下图提示，在外部 DNS 解析服务中设置 _acme-challenge.cdn.a.com cname 指向 cdn.a.com.uuid.dcv.cloudflare.com，然后关闭 [ SSL\TLS ] 和 [通用 SSL ] 十几分钟后恢复。]]></summary>

虽然之前有人发了，但实在太神奇所以再补充下，原理可以看参考资料:，https://www.v2ex.com/t/1014864

方法就是打开 prefix hint 功能，
![1000013041.webp]( https://j.teno.cx/root/2024/09/01/66d47f8d48c53.webp)
输入当前 IP 前缀或者按照 bras 的前缀写全尝试也可以，也就是可以调靓号，也可以全 0 补全，（如图上就是 0 补全）如果报错就是 bras 拒绝了手动的前缀
实测本地移动全 0 最短前缀可以，/48 ～/60 的子网部分 随便改靓号，电信如果改的太短或者太靓号会强制修改几个位，没法全 0 最短前缀，但只要分配给我了就可以一直用
# 此方法修改后重拨号前缀固定，理论上只要 bras 方这段前缀不过期就可以一直用，算静态 ipv6 体验卡

关于如何 win 系统用短 ipv6 ，
win 系统要把 ipv6 临时地址和 ra 通告给禁用了，适配器里面再改成手动获取 ipv6 地址
实现 12 位超短 ipv6 地址
linux 系统更简单，直接配置静态 ipv6 即可，
安卓只支持 slaac 短不了一点，iOS MacOS 似乎没法静态 ipv6 ，用有状态 dhcpv6 可以分固定 v6 ，（但 ROS 不支持有状态）]]></summary>

1 、首先尝试 Mac 自带恢复模式进行升级操作，尴尬的是磁盘空间不足差了 3GB ，没辙。
2 、于是尝试用制作 U 盘启动器的方式来升级，但是选择升级过程中报错「这个“安装 macOS Sonoma”应用程序副本已损坏，不能用来安装 macOS 」，终端设置 date 时间无效。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[在甲骨文免费的机器上用 docker 运行着一个 vaultwarden 服务，用来管理自己的所有密码。
因为是免费的 vps ，为了避免机器被忽然回收导致数据丢失，因此需要定期备份 vaultwarden 的数据库。
首先 vaultwarden 使用了 docker compose 部署，部署文件如下：
services:
  vaultwarden:
    image: vaultwarden/server:latest
    container_name: vaultwarden
    restart: always
    environment:
      SIGNUPS_ALLOWED: false # Deactivate this with "false" after you have created your account so that no strangers can register
    volumes:
      - ./vw-data:/data # the path before the : can be changed
    ports:
      - 11001:80 # you can replace the 11001 with your preferred port

因此在 vw-data 下面，保存着所有密码数据，只要备份这个目录，就可以还原。
备份工具使用 restic ，它支持将数据直接备份到远程，下面步骤主要是设置好备份地址，然后定期执行的操作细节：
一： 首先安装 restic
sudo apt update
sudo apt install restic

二： 初始化 restic 仓库
先设置好环境变量：
export RESTIC_REPOSITORY=s3:https://<minio-ho…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[前言
最近更新了我的系列文章，其中有一部分是关于 JavaScript 语言中“点表示法”的使用。
文章中有 5 个工具函数是纯JavaScript的，我觉得不仅仅是小程序项目用得上，其他前端 JS 项目也应该用得上。
我把文章中的这一部分单独整理出来，给需要写前端代码的朋友参考参考。
你可以直接在 Github 项目 中的前端 utils.js 文件中找到这 5 个工具函数。
下面是文章节选，完整的文章列表可以在 Github 项目 中查看。
点表示法a.b.c
用点表示法给对象赋值：putValue函数
想象一下，如果a是一个对象，你要给a.b.c.d赋值为 1 ，你会这样写？
let a // 通过某种方式获得的对象
if (!a.b) {
  a.b = {}
}
if (!a.b.c) {
  a.b.c = {}
}
a.b.c.d = 1

拜托，大学生才这样写。为此，我们引入了putValue函数：
utils.putValue(a, 'b.c.d', 1)

putValue函数会自动创建a.b、a.b.c中间对象，它的声明如下：
/**
* 向对象中按照路径赋值，如果路径上的中间对象不存在，则自动创建。
* @param {Object} obj - 目标对象。
* @param {string} key - 属性路径，支持'a.b.c'形式。
* @param {*} value - 要设置的值。
* @param {Object} [options={}] - 可选参数。
*   - {boolean} remove_undefined - 如果为 true 且 value 为 undefined ，则删除该属性。
* @throws {Error} 如果 obj 为 null 或 undefined ，或路径不合法（如中间非对象）则抛出异常。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Spring RestTemplate 拦截器修改请求体导致的诡异问题
最近在工作中发现了 Spring 的一个"特性"（也许可以叫 Bug ？），反正我已经给 Spring 提了 PR ，等着看能不能合进去。
问题背景
最近在调用第三方 API 时，遇到了一个有意思的场景。整个调用流程大概是这样的：
先调用 /login 接口，发送 username 和 password ，对方服务返回一个 JWT 。
之后的每个请求接口都是标准格式，需要把 JWT 和请求参数放到一个 JSON 中，类似这样：
{
    "token": "JWT-TOKENxxxxxx",
    "data": {
        "key1": "value1",
        "key2": "value2"
    }
}

发送请求，然后拿到响应报文。
解决方案
为了避免在每个接口都重复封装 token ，我想到了用 org.springframework.http.client.ClientHttpRequestInterceptor 来拦截请求，统一修改请求体。
代码大概长这样：
this.restTemplate = new RestTemplateBuilder()
        .requestFactory(() -> new ReactorNettyClientRequestFactory())
        .interceptors((request, body, execution) -> {
            byte[] newBody = addToken(body); // 调用登陆获取 token ，修改入参 body ，添加 token
            return execution.execute(request, newBody);…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[周围同事认为事假会“扣薪”，所以不到万不得已不会轻易请事假。但在本人的认知里，本来人就没去上班，没有当天的薪资很正常，故即使年假用光了也会经常以小时为单位请事假。（被调侃了下“没有生活压力~”）
关于这点认知的差异我稍感兴趣。可能是我一直以来都是按时薪去计算薪资，导致观念里认为自己的工作是计时的；但其他人或许不这么认为，他们大概更倾向于固定薪资（？），所以才会有因事假失去了当天的薪资属于被“扣薪”的观念。
综上，发帖调查统计下其他人的观念。]]></summary>

Apple TV 使用 Qx 作为网关，家里设备多，不想每台设备单独设置网关和 DNS ，所以在路由器上统一设置了 IPv4 网关和 DNS 指向 Apple TV 的固定 IP 。
目前发现一个问题，路由器开启 IPv6 的情况下，家里设备除 Apple TV 本身外都无法连接外网。关闭 IPv6 后所有设备可以正常访问外网，基本可以确定是 IPv6 导致的问题，我猜测可能是路由器只设置了 IPv4 的网关和 DNS ，但家里设备都被分配了 IPv6 的地址，导致仍然通过主路由的 IPv6 DNS 去做解析。但由于家里还在使用 iptv 看电视，所以也无法关闭 IPv6 。
目前我想到的办法是获取并固定 Apple TV 的 IPv6 地址，将主路由的 IPv6 DNS 指向它。但在 Apple TV 中没有找到相关的操作办法。
求教有没有其他方式可以解决呢？梅林固件上的 clash 调整策略太不方便了。]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[文科转码，毕业五年，从最开始的 Java 业务开发，转到 Go 后端开发，再到分布式存储，再转到数据库内核。
折腾了两个开源项目，分别有 4.5k star 和 2k star 。
公众号 8k 粉丝，B 站 7k 粉丝，知乎 5k 粉丝。
有几点感受最为深刻：
拥抱变化，其实这也是我觉得毕业这五年以来最大的一个感受，变化是每时每刻都存在的，我们的一些工作内容有可能随着我们自己的兴趣发生变化，也有可能随着其他的一些环境的因素发生变化。比如说你跳槽了，业务方向不一样了，或者是转了语言，其实都有可能，或者是你自己的一些组织架构发生了一些调整，导致你的工作内容也发生了很多变化，都是很正常的。所以说对于很多刚毕业没多久，或者说还没有毕业的同学，一定要有一种拥抱变化的一种心态。我们的工作内容可能随时跟随着很多因素去变化，所以说这个时候，不要把自己局限在一个小的范围之内。
追求极致，去做别人坚持不下去的事情，才能和别人拉开差距。
热爱某件事情就去折腾，或许这件事儿能够带给你意想不到的惊喜
有时候也觉得迷茫，对于我们程序员群体来说，可能并没有什么丰富的业余活动，社交的圈子也比较窄，如果又是一个比较内向的人的话，可能有的时候在这样一个大城市当中，会觉得非常的孤独，就是没有什么知心的朋友。亲朋好友可能也隔得比较远，没有什么太多的联系。
我觉得这可能是每一个打工人可能都会有的一种孤独感吧。

文件分享网站这些,也基本需要登录,还限制文件大小和下载速度,要开 vip
所以开发了一款文件传输 APP,同一 wifi 只需要手机端安装
不是同一 wifi 的也可分享文件,需要两个设备都安装
分享文件无需像其他平台一样注册登录,视频是原画质播放,支持大文件上传
上传时本地会先使用随机密钥加密文件数据流,然后再上传到服务器 
上传完成后分享码中会携带本次密钥 文件地址 名称 大小等信息 
只要不泄漏分享码,没有任何人知道你上传的文件内容,即使是服务器
支持加密视频在线播放 
只要同一 wifi 设备中一款手机安装了此应用,其他连接此 wifi 的设备均可通过局域网网页加密上传/下载/播放文件
项目地址: https://gitlab.com/ivgeek/mixfile
有用的话麻烦点个 star 支持下]]></summary>

使用非常简单，我们打开我的磨官网 https://wodemo.net 或 https://wodemo.com/  注册一个账号即可，用户名就是网站前缀。比如我注册的是 huangetech ，网址就是 https://huangetech.wodemo.com 我们可以添加文章或者上传我们的文件，我的磨（一般喜欢称之为磨盘）提供无限量的储存空间且永不会删除。曾经很多草根站长会将文件存放至磨盘以供用户下载。
最后 我的磨没有盈利模式，没有捐赠入口，没有公司或个人介绍，甚至没有基本的使用条款（ TOS ）。诡异的运行至今，我们不能确定他能够运行多久。但 14 年来未曾出过问题。]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[今年4月，我曾经制定了一个“IMDb250观影计划”，打算在今年看完“IMDb250”的全部电影，今天我终于完成了这个计划，看完了IMDb250的全部250部电影，下面是我的一些观影体验。


数据统计


这250部电影中，14部日本电影，4部韩国电影，8部印度电影，224部欧美电影和其他地区电影。


对于IMDb250的电影，我的打分里，一共给40部电影打5星，155部电影打4星，55部电影打3星。做为对比，我对于豆瓣250的打分里，一共给68部电影打5星，175部电影打4星，7部电影打3星。从数据上看，我的豆瓣250打分里，5星和4星的数量都高于IMDb250，由此可见，对于我来说，豆瓣250比IMDb250更符合我的胃口。


我的打分标准


我的打分方法标准是，看完一部电影之后，我会问自己一个问题：这部电影，你还想看第2遍吗？


1、我给电影打5星的标准是：


（1）这部电影我想立刻看第2遍、第3遍、第4遍……


（2）这部电影感动得我落下泪水。


（3）这部电影让我陷入长时间的思考。


2、打4星的标准是：


电影还行，如果有时间，可能会看第2遍。


3、打3星的标准是：


看一遍就够了，不会再看了。


4、打2星的标准是：


看了一半，看不下去了。


5、打1星的标准是：


只看了开头几分钟，就看不下去了。


IMDb250与豆瓣250的对比


做为先后看完豆瓣250和IMDb250的观众，自然而然会对这两个榜单进行对比，实际上，IMDb250和豆瓣250作为两个广受认可的电影榜单，两者之间存在一些显著的差别，主要体现在以下几个方面：


1、文化差异巨大


IMDb榜单对中文不太友好，里面没有华语电影，大部分是英文电影，表现的主要是欧美文化，…]]></summary>

I first started out with mint, but as of 2 days ago just switched to straight up debian. Linux is really fun! The community seems really cool and it's so fin to mess around with, I consider it my second most used laptop LOL. If I was given the choice to choose Linux or windows while being given a new pc id probably pick windows (I know that's a huge L 😔) but Linux is genuinely so cool and really fascinating. I don't know how to code, but it's fun looking up tutorials that involve code and typing in the stuff. Pretty much it!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi everyone, my team is building a wearable camera that enables athletes to capture and livestream their first-person POV during games completely accessory-free, opening up a world of possibilities for training, analysis, and fan engagement, and translatable into other verticals.
 A couple of the things that make our startup stand out:
  
Every action camera in the market requires some type of accessory to be used (chest strap, magnetic necklace), making it impossible to be used in contact sports. Our patented design allows for the camera to be applied directly onto any type of fabric completely accessory-free.
 On the software side, the top action cameras in the market allow you to only stream footage from the device to your app - our app allows to stream the footage from Ucam globally.
 We already have a stellar lineup of investors and advisors, including a former NBA Champion & DPOY, WNBA All-Stars, the CDO of 3Step Sports, one of the Atlanta Dream team owners, and the Executive VP of HoopGroup, to name a few.
  
We're currently seeking a firmware engineer to add to the team. If you're interested in having a conversation, please let me know. Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'll admit I'm forced to use Windows occasionally and there are a couple shortcuts I use a lot. These are quick access to special characters and quick access to the Snipping Tool and the Emoji Panel. Here are some simple keyboard shortcuts you can set up to bring that functionality over to Linux.
 Access Keyboard Shortcuts
  
Open Settings.
 Go to Keyboard.
 Scroll to Keyboard Shortcuts.
  
1. Screenshot a Selected Area and Copy Directly to the Clipboard
  
Command: gnome-screenshot -ca
 Shortcut: Shift + Super + S
 Setup: 
 In Custom Shortcuts, click +.
 Name it "Screenshot to Clipboard."
 Enter gnome-screenshot -ca.
 Set the shortcut to Shift + Super + S.
 
  
2. Open GNOME Characters
  
Command: gnome-characters
 Shortcut: Super + . (Super Key + Period)
 Setup: 
 In Custom Shortcuts, click +.
 Name it "GNOME Characters."
 Enter gnome-characters.
 Set the shortcut to Super + ..
 
  
Final Notes
 I use Debian / Cinnamon 
 Super Key or Super for short is also known as the Windows Key, Command Key, Meta Key, etc.
 The GNOME Characters tool does not include GIFs. (Maybe someday ;) )
 Make sure your shortcuts don’t conflict with others. Enjoy!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Probably because Tuxedo doesn't advertise it as a seperate distro but i haven't seen a better balance in any other distro. Also no one really talks about it anywhere.
 The best thing about it is Hybrid release model. You get the latest kernel and kde but base remains LTS stable so the best of both worlds. It was one of the earliest kde 6 adopter and latest kernel is great for how rapidly gaming is growing on Linux. They also do some testing before shipping the updates and it's the default os that ships with their hardware so you can be sure it'll work. Wayland is used by default. Flatpak and nvidia drivers are pre-installed. Snaps are removed (I know they're preferred for servers but majority don't like them on personal computers so this is still a plus).
 What do you guys think about it?
 Edit: They're also KDE patron and organize their events in Tuxedo offices, i think that's pretty nice.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[我家里有一台旧笔记本改装的 NAS （黑裙辉），内网穿透的方案是自己买域名+Cloudflare DNS 解析+DDNS 。
目前托管了多个容器（基于 Docker ），有 Emby 、Komga 、DDNS 等等，当然也包含最基础的文件访问功能。
目前是基于 HTTP ，因为 Docker 容器貌似无法 HTTPS 连接（可能是我自己不会弄）。
每一个容器访问都需要单独的密码（只有我自己可以访问），公网只开放了若干个虚拟端口（路由器转发）关闭 SSL 远程访问功能。
这套方案已经运行了一年多了，一直很稳定。应该是由于我最近得了焦虑症的原因，我突然对此感到很焦虑。
原因是我当初选择内网穿透的原因就是方便我在学校连接 NAS 看电影（也可以远程控制 NAS 通过磁力下载电影）。虽然使用包括 Emby 在内的所有容器都需要密码，只有我自己可以访问。但是我还是担心版权问题（害怕收律师函）。
还有一点要提及的，因为我们家用的旁路由代理，因此 NAS 所有的流量都会经过旁路由进行分流，例如磁力相关会直链，不排除漏网之鱼，Emby 的海报源因为来自于 imdb 所以是走代理。基本上除了特别设置（例如磁力源），都是根据解析网站 IP 或者网址本身来分流的，中国大陆的 IP/网站是直连，日本的 IP/网站走日本节点，台北的 IP/网站走台北节点，小众地区统一走日本节点。
不知道我的担心是不是有点多余了，想听听看各位大佬，尤其是跟我一样家用 NAS 内网穿透的大佬发表一下自己的看法。
欢迎友好讨论，请不要阴阳怪气谢谢。因为我目前焦虑症的原因，是真的有可能会因为这些阴阳怪气的言论而感到内耗的。还请大家多包涵，我在这里先谢谢大家了。]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[事情是这样的，若干年前，那会儿我还是个刚满 18 岁的小孩，也拥有了人生第一台笔记本。
当时的我对科技/程序这块非常感兴趣，也学着开始上外网，但是当时我囊中羞涩，于是特别喜欢开启网站内容（例如 Prime Video ）/电脑软件（例如 Vmware 或者 Funsion 或者 Adobe ，只是举个例子）的试用。在试用期结束之后往往就放着不管了。
这也成了本次事件让我焦虑的核心。由于当时的我年纪不大，不懂什么“料卡”什么“一次性邮箱”这种概念，往往直接用自己的 QQ 邮箱/outlook/gmail 注册账户并开启试用。
有些试用只需要绑定邮箱/验证手机号就可以使用，有些试用则需要绑定银行卡才行。当时，我手里有一张自己名下的跨境通 Visa 卡，于是就把自己的卡绑定上去了。
由于我卡里长年不放钱（余额小于 1 美元），因此即使后续发生扣款，也是无法扣成功的。
长大之后的我知道了不可以如此随便的开启试用（不能抱着白嫖的心态），但是感觉为时已晚，现在的我能做到的只能是把当时我开的那张跨境通 Visa 卡销户。
因为目前我患有焦虑症，所以对自己十分敏感。我最近看到了 Adobe 的新闻，又让我感到十分内耗，害怕我未来因为之前白嫖试用的事情被清算。
但是由于距离事发已经过去了三四年了，邮箱记录丢失，我的记忆也都十分模糊了，因此完全不记得我曾经开启过哪些试用。
还有一点也很让我头疼，就是因为我记性不好，加上当时有多个邮箱。于是就经常会出现注册的时候用 Outlook 注册，过了一段时间登陆时候搞错用了 Google 登陆（相当于自动注册了一个新号）的乌龙。这导致往往同一个网站我可能有多个账号，或者有那种未完成注册（验证了邮箱，但是没输入信息）的账号。不知道大家会不会也有这样的经历？
因此希望各位大佬能发表一下自己的看法，我的担心是不是有些太夸张了？
后续如果真的有什么问题的话，对方会邮件通知我吗？]]></summary>

查到最后发现是 docker 里起的服务，病毒文件在容器 tmp 目录里，宿主机/var/lib/docker/overlay2/容器 id/merged/tmp 也有
病毒是个挖矿程序，跟这个帖子一样 https://www.v2ex.com/t/969255 ，也是 c3pool 的账号
这个病毒挺能潜伏的，有日志文件，发现两个月前就在了，只是 cpu 占用不高没被发现，容器里一堆脚本 networkSync 、kdevtmpfsi 、watchdogs
目前处理方法是重新构建了镜像（怀疑是很久之前某次构建镜像源有问题？因为容器创建都 1 年多了，中途都是拷贝代码到容器重启）
这种人有办法搞他么？脚本备份了，有他 c3pool 的 user 信息，暂时先不放出来，怕被看到，因为不确定毒是否清干净了，咱也不是专业运维
有两个问题希望有遇到过的老哥能解惑下
1 、tmp 目录没映射为啥宿主机也有对应的文件，是 docker 内部能越权还是 docker 内所有文件宿主机都能直接查到？
2 、相同代码、依赖镜像还有其他容器，但是只有这个出了问题，除了镜像源投毒，java 依赖包有可能干这事么
这个病毒挺能潜伏的，有日志文件，发现两个月前就在了，只是 cpu 占用不高没被发现
提醒下各位同志们检查下自己服务器 tmp 或者容器 tmp ，有没有可疑文件（ xm 、networkSync 、kdevtmpfsi 、watchdogs 之类的），这货账号下有 100 多个矿机。。。估计都是肉鸡]]></summary>

从上到下分别是百度，阿里，字节，可以看到百度和字节在某些节点不知道怎么回事解析不出 qq 空间的域名，但是其他域名是可以解析的，这点在我本地的电信宽带可以复现

看来国内 dns 亦有差异啊，不能只看延迟低]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[找人写个域名批量扫描的程序,预算 3000 不知道行不行?
要求如下:
由于有性能要求,最好是 go 语言,并且有 python 能力(有一些以前的代码)
最好会前端(其他都 OK 的话,前端我另外找人)
对域名有所了解,比如域名的状态,域名的 whois 查询协议,比如查询协议用的是哪个端口?
对域名的解析有所了解,比如任何一个域名是如何访问正确的服务器的过程,我需要不通过 whois 批量查询域名 DNS(学习能力特别强的也可以)
Docker 交付能力,除非配置简单,或者一键 shell 脚本
对 linux 了解,兼容 debian 11-12
其实可以参考这家代码 https://github.com/likexian/whois , 但是我我需要更多的后缀,如果官方不支持 whois 协议,可以通过 DNS 查询或者爬虫?
工期 2 个月,其实不急,但是 2 个月完成不话就太久了
价格私聊,请根据你的工时报价
联系我发给你文档哈:TG https://t.me/xieebaobao
请仔细阅读需求文档,如果哪项不支持,也不是需要全部完成的.请提前告知商议.
技术问题可以先看一下自己是否合适哈
问题 1:
一般域名有如下状态(状态 1):
Free
Registered
Not renewed
Expired
Redemption
Pending del
但是根据 icann 的定义,域名状态(状态 2)如下
https://www.icann.org/resources/pages/epp-status-codes-2014-06-16-en
比如
Domain Status: clientDeleteProhibited https://icann.org/epp#clientDeleteProhibited
Domain Status: clientRenewProhibited https://icann.org/epp#clientRenewProhibited
Domain Status: clientTransferProhibited https://icann.org/epp#clientTransferProhibited
Domain Status: clientUpdateProhibited https://icann.org/epp#clientUpdateProhibited
1.
两种状态(状态 1 和状态 2)之间的关系?
2.如何获取状态 1 和 2
3 ，并且哪些域名有这些状态,哪些域名的状态是不可查询的.
问题 2:
1 ，关于域名 whois 的查询,哪些后缀是支持 RDAP 的?哪些只支持传统协议?如果两种都不支持怎么办?
2 ，两种都不支持的后缀包含在项目范围中吗?
问题 3:
批量扫描肯定是要用代理的,但是域名扫描的协议用的是哪个端口?大部分代理都是不支持的哦]]></summary>

软件：chrome 128.0.6613.98 （手机上最新版）
问题：
点开 chrome ，打开书签页面就一直转圈圈加载，无法成功加载，
书签都还好，我不同步好吧，就本地添加书签，但是不能忍受的是：操作 3 分钟左右，chrome 就崩了，对，崩了，直接就退出了
解决：找了一大圈关于 iPhone 手机上问题，也没有解决，譬如：清缓存、chrome 更新最新版本、退账户、重启手机等等
最终解决：直接切换 edge,别提多丝滑了
最后的最后：不知道是 iPhone 不兼容 chrome ，还是 chrome 不兼容？反正就是很别扭
不知大家有没有用到，其实 safari 在手机端也好用]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[经历过 08 年大地震，加上常居四川，对地震信息比较敏感。
之前一直用某款地震预警 App ，最近发现安装包体积已经 500 MB 了，于是抽业余时间写了一个原生 App 来查看地震信息和接收通知。
第一次写 iOS App ，一开始只打算自用。但后面也想走一下 App Store 发布流程，就上架了。
核心功能
全球主流数据源，包含：美国地质调查局（ USGS ）、欧洲地中海地震中心（ EMSC ）、中国地震台网中心（ CEIC ）、日本气象厅（ JMA ）、台湾中央气象局（ CWB ）等；
地震数据可视化，不同的地图样式，并提供地震详情；
地震数据洞察，了解一段时间的震情数据；
服务器端的地震通知，可以实现全球地震通知，无需打开 app ；
SwiftUI 原生应用，无广告，无隐私忧虑。上手简单，易于使用；
针对 iPad 和 macOS 大屏幕适配；
预览



地震消息并不是每个人都需要或者习惯性关注，所以应用设为了一次性付费，国区是 18 元。
用户规模可控，消息的触达及时性就会比较好。
由于我自己也是用户，所以会持续维护，这样付费用户也会有更好的体验。接下来主要的方向：
接入 Critical Alerts ，权限 Apple 还在审核；
在细节，稳定性，及时性上继续优化；
接入更多数据源，在数据方面继续深挖；
如果你对地震信息感兴趣，可以 试试 QuakeSense 震感，也欢迎提出建议。
顺便用 Tailwind CSS 写了一个网站： https://quakesense.app/
再次感叹 Tailwind CSS 真好用。]]></summary>

想问下大家该怎么办，岳父属于比较犟的，我又不想和他硬刚，十一放假回去本来开开心心的，这样和他顶撞都不太好，又害怕寄生虫这类的，真的煮熟了就没问题吗？有没有专家出来说说。
我本身喜欢吃黄鳝的，但是后来看到了寄生虫这类，就再也不敢吃了，现在让我的宝宝吃，其实也有点膈应，如果高温烹饪真的能杀死寄生虫的话，那吃就吃吧。]]></summary>

这几天把所有相册通过外部图库管理，总共两千多张照片，两百多视频。智能搜索这些任务也都重新运行了，然而现在搜索文字，出现在靠前的要么是无关视频要么是不包含搜索文字内容的图片，但我用 immich 主要原因就是为了搜索图片中的文字，目前 immich 已升级最新 v1.113.0 ，CLIP 模型 XLM-Roberta-Large-Vit-B-16Plus 也是最新。
纳闷是什么问题造成的，是照片数量太多了？不知道你们有没有这种问题，主要是搜索图片中的文字这个能力。]]></summary>

老婆：你去买 2 斤西红柿，路上看到卖西瓜的就买 2 个。
“半个小时后，程序员拿着 2 个西红柿给到了媳妇。”
老婆：你怎么就买了 2 个西红柿？
程序员：路上看到卖西瓜的了
京 B 牌照摩托车能不能进入到四环路内辅路行驶？
背景（给不是北京的小伙伴的）
根据道路交通安全法律法规的规定，对本市部分道路上行驶的摩托车采取交通管理措施如下：四环路（不含辅路）以内道路全天禁止京 B 号牌摩托车行驶。
以上出自： https://jtgl.beijing.gov.cn/hudong/xinxiang/jtgl/sindex/bjah-index-dept!detail.action?originalId=AH23091310036
关键的一句话就是：四环路（不含辅路）以内道路全天禁止京 B 号牌摩托车行驶。
问题
北京的四环路是封闭的一个环状，这就有了“四环里”和“四环外”的说法，四环主路两次存在“内辅路”和“外辅路”的说法。
我媳妇认为可以进入四环内，只要在内辅路行驶就没问题
其解题思路为：
京 B 牌照摩托车
// 1: 不能在四环主路上行驶
// 2: 不能在四环内行驶
// 3: 可以在四环辅路行驶，内辅路也是辅路

所以，可以从四环路的某个桥底下，进入四环内，然后拐入到四环内辅路即可。所有的条件都符合啊


为此我媳妇打过电话给交警 12123 。
第 1 个客服说：不行。
第 2 个客服说：不知道，没有明确规定。
然后网上也有支持她这个观点的帖子： https://www.yiche.com/baike/131762.htm
我说进入就违法扣分
我就给她讲了开头那个买西瓜的笑话。
但是没说服她～～
为啥我们会讨论这个事呢？因为我俩都有京 B 牌照摩托车～]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[立秋了，但还是很热。
镇上创文明树新风，
取缔无证小商小贩，
整治商户门前用地。
像阿志这种站街揽客卖服务的，
都被无限期勒令停业。
阿志没了事做。
***
午后，
在阿宝超市门口，
树下的长椅上，
阿志躺了。
太阳很大，
但树荫下并不太热。
微风偶而吹过，
温温的，很舒服。
迷迷糊糊中，
阿志似乎听到了咔嚓声，
母亲切开冰镇大西瓜，
自己在小桌前，
期待着。
***
“别翻了！冰糕全都让你给翻坏了！”
是阿宝的声音。
阿宝老婆一般不让他来看店，
因为他老得罪人。
有一次，
一个老太太讨价还价，来回了几句，
阿宝一把夺过老太太手里的东西，
把人给轰了出去。
现在阿宝关上了冰柜拉门，
要赶走面前的大爷。
大爷稀疏的头发和着汗水粘在头皮上，
抬头看着阿宝，张开的嘴微颤着，
说不出话来。
这时，阿宝老婆回来了。
“来了何大爷！
棒棒冰换位置了，
在里面这个冰柜呢。”
说着拿出一个棒棒冰递给何大爷，
何大爷接过，放下几个硬币，
转身朝树下走来。
***
阿志看何大爷来了，
连忙坐起让出位置。
“日子没法过了啊！”
何大爷坐下，叹了一口气，
把棒棒冰一掰两节，
递给阿志一半：
“太凉了，我一个人吃不完。”
阿志没说话，接了过来。
“日子真是没法过了啊！”
何大爷又说了一遍。
“是啊～”
阿志应了一句。
何大爷就接受了邀请，开始了倾诉。
***
年初，何大爷死了老婆。
“活着的时候，总吵架，
这死了，连吵架的人都没有了。”
“跟你吵架，都是因为在乎你，
不在乎的，都不会搭理你。”
“女儿没用，早晚都要嫁出去，
不嫁出去也没时间应付我这老头子。”
“人老了，就招人嫌。”
“她要是嫁出去，我也就不再操心了。”
“都三十好几了，还能嫁出去吗？”
何老头停下来，看着阿志。
阿志低头，
嗦着棒棒冰，思考着，
不知道这是个疑问句还是反问句。
何老头没等到阿志回答，
继续唠叨了下去。
棒棒冰吃完了，
何老头在裤子上抹了抹手，说：
“要不……你给我推个头吧？”
***
吃人嘴软，阿志就答应了。
外边不让摆摊，
何老头就说去他家推，
推完刚好方便洗一下。
推完，
何老头去洗，
阿志说要走。
何老头从洗手间里顶着湿头发跑出来，
抓住阿志的手说：
“不走不走！吃个瓜再走！吃个瓜再走！”
阿志说不了不了，何老头急得跺脚：
“瓜太大！我一个人吃不完！切开了就要坏！”
阿志就留下了。
吃完瓜，
何老头又要了阿志手机号，
说自己的手机两星期没响了，
以前还有推销电话，现在连推销的也没了。
“那你女儿呢？”
阿志说完，就觉得自己多了嘴。
何老头长叹一口气：
“不知道。”
“那你没问问？”
可能是觉得吃了别人的瓜，
多少要说两句，阿志就又多了一嘴。
“一年回来一次，死了给你下葬，
就不错了，别想太多。”
“问一问嘛，万一有什么事呢？”
***
最后还是问了。
何老头拔了电话，开着免提，
嘟到第五声，终于接通了。
“爸？！怎么给我打电话了？！有事么？！”
“啊……”
“你现在在家么？！出什么事情了么？！”
“在家，没事……”
“那挂了啊～我正搬着东西呢！”
嘟一下，电话就挂了。
阿志不知道该说什么，
屋里一片沉默。
何老头把手机咣当扔到一边：
“看，还没死就不能给女儿打电话！”
这时，咚咚咚门响了。
“开门！”
是一个女人的声音。
何老头噌一下从椅子上站起来，看着门口。
“爸！快开门！东西拿不住了！”
阿志冲过去，打开了门。
***
门外，是何老头的女儿。
“你这个时候回来干什么？！”
何老头又气又喜又不愿人看出来，
一边说着气话一边从女儿手里接过东西，
“西瓜都吃完了，早说就给你留一些！”
“不用！我带了！”
说着，何老头女儿转身抱进来一个大西瓜。
阿志要走，
父女俩实在热情，
把阿志按在了椅子上，
一定要留他吃晚饭。
饭后，喝茶闲聊。
何老头问阿志，
三十多岁单身又没病，
怎么就没想着找个老婆？
阿志放下茶碗，犹豫了一下，
讲起了自己从来没讲过的事。
***
三年前，有突变病毒时，
阿志和女朋友准备领证，
女朋友回父母家拿户口本。
女朋友刚下车，
病毒爆发，全城静默。
被判为密接，立即隔离，
凌晨被装上了转运大巴。
然后就出了车祸。
再也没能回来。
阿志发了疯，打了人，
被关进去了几个月。
出来后，
没了工作，也没了爱人，
想着不如回家照顾父母，
就回来了。
刚到家，管控放开，
所有人都得上了那个病。
刚开始那两天，
买不到药，只能硬扛。
扛过去的人里，
没有阿志的父母。
***
“日子过着没意思，
没想过会干起快推。”
阿志笑了笑，端起了茶碗。
又坐了一会儿，阿志告辞，
何老头女儿出门送客。
“谢谢你来给我爸理发。”
阿志想说：“不用谢，收了钱的”，
忽然想起，收钱的事，又忘记了。
***
太阳落山了，
天空是很深很深的蓝色，
隐约有几颗星星在闪。
一阵温热的夜风吹来，
夹着一丝凉爽。
这灼人的夏天，
似乎真的要结束了。]]></summary>

 Android dominates the World right now and while it uses a Linux kernel, the userland is quite foreign. Some un-Googled ROMs like GrapheneOS are great, but still not the same thing as a true Linux system.
 I thought Linux on mobile was pretty much dead, but I have been test driving SailfishOS on an old Sony device and I am really impressed. It is very practical, and a little Android emulation layer makes it possible to use most Android applications as native, in case that is needed.
 Desktop Linux is truly great these days. IMHO, as a community, the Linux mobile stack#/media/File:Free_and_open-source-software_display_servers_and_UI_toolkits.svg) should get a lot more of support and discussion here!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[首先宇宙安全声明没用的 GPT 回答确实很垃圾，奈何它这次说的有点过于正确。。。
心理压力增加: 高压式教育通常会导致孩子感受到巨大的心理压力。长期处于这种状态可能导致焦虑、抑郁等心理健康问题。
自尊心和自信心受损: 当孩子在高压下无法达到预期目标时，他们可能会感到自卑、怀疑自己的能力，从而损害自尊心和自信心。
亲子关系紧张: 高压式的教育方式可能会导致父母与孩子之间的关系变得紧张。孩子可能会觉得不被理解，甚至反感父母的教育方式，疏远与父母的关系。
学习兴趣减退: 把学习任务变成高压的责任，可能会让孩子对学习失去兴趣，把学习当成痛苦的负担，而不是乐趣和探索的来源。
身体健康问题: 长期的高压可能会对孩子的身体健康产生不良影响，如失眠、食欲不振、免疫力下降等。
竞争观念扭曲: 孩子可能会错误地认为成功只能通过激烈竞争和不懈努力获得，忽略了合作、创造力和个人爱好的重要性。
社交技能缺失: 在高压环境下，孩子可能会花大量时间在学习上，忽略了社交活动，导致社交技巧欠缺，不懂得如何与人交往和合作。
价值观扭曲: 过于强调成绩、名次等外在评价标准，可能会让孩子形成错误的价值观，忽视内在品质和多样化的成功标准。
反抗行为: 持续的压力可能会引发孩子的逆反心理，出现不服从、对抗等行为，甚至会出现逃避、厌学等情况。]]></summary>

如果能像防火墙一样可以同时开放 tcp 和 udp 就好了，然后可以一个配置写多个端口，自己能够一一对应就好了]]></summary>

 Or will Google just transition Chrome OS to meet their demands. 
 Of course this all might be moot with everything moving to the cloud.

指责就你连分表都不会吗？性能上线后绝对很大问题，数据量大了怎么办？问多大就会有问题 说几百万就卡死了啊，订单表以后靠删数据吗？ 然后我查了下公司上线快两年的海外社交项目 线上库 表里订单不到 150 万 也没分表，那会他来之前已经上线了。。。
顺便扯扯这开发组长写的代码那叫一个难看，比如变量名＝ 前后不加空格，不按业界编码习惯，甚至代码缩进乱七八糟的，一会二个空格，下一行一会六个，一会甚至没任何缩进，写的代码没任何注释，方法上的用途 没任何注释，算高级防御性编程？每次去改他代码都觉得恶心，平时说话又冲的要死
不同订单做不同表而不是类型区分，十种订单十张表，订单表和支付表都拆分，为了拆而拆 他说了算]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Healthy communities are not built on confrontation. Yet, here we are, with meme-grade "Windows bad" posts every single day. Sure, pretending that Windows doesn't exist is silly, but obsessing about it is way worse.
 There is a lot to discuss about Linux itself and the related ecosystems. Linux-based operating systems have existed for decades and have evolved into all possible directions. They are neither a negation nor an alternative of Windows.
 We don't have an explicit rule forbidding bashing proprietary software. Would the community approve such a rule?
 PS: I understand that this would require stricter moderation, but I believe addressing the "Windows bad" posts is vital for the future of the subreddit.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[之前写前端比较多，最近开始用 Spring boot 开发 api
使用的是 JPA Hibernate orm+jdk21 方案，我不知道为什么感觉国内很多人不喜欢这个 Hibernate ，但是我自己用下来感觉非常好，它最牛逼的是可以按照 Entity 生成数据库结构，非常智能，所以你只要把实体定义好，一切都 ok 了，很容易维护。
有个插件 JPA buddy ，非常好用，可以很好规范代码。
JPA 也可以自定义 sql ，很灵活，除了在转成 json 的时候，会遇到无限循环的问题，其他感觉都很好。
感觉 Spring boot 写后端，除了 JAVA 本身有点啰嗦，还有编译很浪费时间，其他都还蛮不错的。
但是 JPA 通过 Entity 生成数据库的时候，为什么字段顺序和 Entity 是不一样的，是打乱的，，id 的位置会随机出现~~我槽，这就像要喝汤的时候飞进了一个苍蝇，我看网上有很多人说要 hack 一下，官方无解，但这个太离谱了。
然后就是 CommandLineRunner ，我本来的需求是需要给项目 seed 一点初始化数据，这个 CommandLineRunner 只在启动的时候自动执行，不能通过 cli 命令执行，，泥马这个 CommandLineRunner 和 Command 一点关系都没有啊，我内个去，所以 seed 数据只能在 CommandLineRunner 加 if 条件。你去看人家 PHP laravel 都有 artisan cil 工具啊，这个可是天天都要用的，为啥你没有啊~~~你 Tomcat 都可以监听指令，为啥就不做一个监听 命令行指令的。
后来我看了一个 spring boot cli 的插件，结果完全不是这个概念。。
为什么这么成熟的框架连这些基本都做不好啊谁可以告诉我一下
然后我现在在看 liquidbase 和 flyway ，还是 flyway 吧，直接 sql 多优雅，liquidbase 那个语法不能忍受~~
谁能告诉我怎么才能优雅的搞后端呢？]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[公司项目用的可能不是最新 go 版本，而我自己折腾一般都是最新版本。但是 goland 没有找到根据不同项目自动切换 dlv 版本的方法。网上都是让 goland 编辑自定义属性 的 bin\idea.properties 文件添加 dlv.path=/xxx ，但这貌似是 goland 的全局配置，也就是所有项目在调试时都使用相同的 dlv 程序。
因此我编写如下代码，用来替换 goland 默认使用的 dlv 程序。该代码会自动识别调试的可执行程序编译的 go 版本，并执行对应 go 版本的 dlv 程序。
只需要在如下路径按照 go 大版本命名存放对应版本 dlv 程序即可。
$GOPATH/bin/dlv.go1.23.exe
$GOPATH/bin/dlv.go1.22.exe
$GOPATH/bin/dlv.go1.21.exe

goland 使用的 dlv 文件就用下面代码编译的可执行程序替换即可。
package main

import (
	"debug/buildinfo"
	"fmt"
	"os"
	"os/exec"
	"path/filepath"
	"strings"
)

func main() {
	var file string
	for i, v := range os.Args {
		if v == "exec" {
			file = os.Args[i+1]
			break
		}
	}
	info, err := buildinfo.ReadFile(file)
	if err != nil {
		panic(err)
	}
	vs := strings.Split(info.GoVersion, ".")

	cmd := exec.Command(
		// install dlv: $GOPATH/bin/dlv.go1.23.exe
		filepath.Join(os.Getenv("GOPATH"), "bin",
			fmt.Sprintf("dlv.%s.%s.exe", vs[0], vs[1])),
		os.Args[1:]...,
	)
	cmd.Stdin, cmd.Stdout, cmd.Stderr = os.Stdin, os.Stdout, os.Stderr

	if err = cmd.Run(); err != nil {
		panic(err)
	}

另外，这个课算是「一堂教育」这家公司的引流课，但是干货是真不少，课程内容是创业或者说商业底层逻辑/方法论的构建，说实话一开始我以为是那种「听懂掌声」或者之前常见的一堆听上去高大上的概念、结果完全无法落地的 IP 韭菜课程，抱着「闲着也是闲着看看他们怎么表演」的心态去听的，但是从「关键假设」开始就觉得有点意思了，到一堂五步法已经是惊讶惊艳了，3 个多小时不知不觉就听完了，要是往常那些直播课我早睡着了…
整个课听完明显能感觉到和市面上其他课的不同，一如他们 CEO 也就是讲师许楚说的，课程是经过理论研究的、是科学的，另外理论推导过程中的案例、教学方式以及概念的准确「翻译」和传达都能体会到确实是辛苦打磨出来的(以我推荐人的话来说就是能够让在校学生和创业老兵都能听懂并且都能带来思考，一堂是有一套的)。
可以吹的有点过了，不过毕竟是免费的，有兴趣的同学可以也抱着试试看的心态去听下是不是像我说的一样，不一样可以回来跟帖批评~

PassNAT 上线一段时间后有不少用户反馈命令行启动的方式不够优雅，那咱就把 frp 打包一下。客户端用了 electron ，用前端技术很方便就把客户端做好了，开发过程中心智负担也比较低。同时也兼容了 windows 和 macos 平台。 
客户端侧有做了一点删减，考虑到它快速创建隧道的特点，直接把选择节点给阉了。后端处理逻辑是自动创建当前订阅等级负载最低的节点。如果需要指定节点可以在网页控制台手动选择创建隧道，客户端会同步数据。
Windows 客户端可以直接在官网进行下载，MacOS 要再过个把月把。要等开发者证书下来，不然自动更新用不了。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello everyone,
 Just a random thought I had recently. I've been using Linux for awhile now. I switched to linux because of cfd being faster in linux and because of technologies like docker, lxc and chroot. In addition, I had some amazing fun playing with linux on my phone via termux too. I still dual boot windows, but I'm slowly just using linux for most things. So effectively I'm in the windows --> linux camp. I see myself most comfortable with kde and I enjoy themes that compliment that workflow.
 However I've known friends who prefer gnome and use macOS like themes, and not so surprisingly is also from a MacOS --> Linux camp. So this got me thinking, can the choice of someone's preferred DE and theme be a good indication of where they are switching from?
 Please share your thoughts on the matter! Let me know (if you dual boot or fully switched) what OS you used to use before coming to linux and if you have a prefered DE and theme?
 Thanks 🫡

If you’re like me, then for Christmas 2014 you or someone you know received an Unbranded 10.1” tablet model UB-15MS10. This thing: https://www.bestbuy.com/site/unbranded-10-1-tablet-32gb-gray/9496117.p . They weren’t very powerful, and it’s likely been collecting dust in a closet for most of the last decade. I have always wanted to install Linux on mine, but I lacked the understanding of the OS to get installed.. until this year.
 I’ve never found much information about these tablets on the internet, and I’ve never seen a step-by-step guide to getting Linux on …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[如果你的 R 是使用比较低版本的 GCC（如 Red Hat 6.5 + GCC/G++ 4.4.7），但安装的 R 包需要开启 C++11 支持，或者需要更高版本的 GCC 和 G++，可以参考一下这个方法。
首先，在 home 目录创建一个 ~/.R/Makevars 文件。
mkdir ~/.R
vi ~/.R/Makevars

然后，在 Makevars 文件中加入以下内容。
CXX11 = /opt/rh/devtoolset-7/root/usr/bin/g++ -std=c++11 -fPIC
CXX14 = /opt/rh/devtoolset-7/root/usr/bin/g++
CXX14FLAGS = -g -O2 $(LTO)
CXX14PICFLAGS = -fpic
CXX14STD = -std=gnu++14

最后，重新打开 R，执行对应包安装。
options("repos"=c(CRAN="https://mirrors.tuna.tsinghua.edu.cn/CRAN/"))
install.packages("gridtext")

Linux being secure is a common misconception in the security and privacy realm. Linux is thought to be secure primarily because of its source model, popular usage in servers, small userbase and confusion about its security features. This article is intended to debunk these misunderstandings by demonstrating the lack of various, important security mechanisms found in other desktop operating systems and identifying critical security problems within Linux's security model, across both user space and the kernel. Overall, other operating systems have a much stronger focus on security and have made many innovations in defensive security technologies, whereas Linux has fallen far behind.

 今年的价格和去年基本上的是一样的,估计量和去年也差不多,总共一万斤左右
  #小程序://快团团/hrjUW1NF1sW2wGk
  https://ktt.pinduoduo.com/t/FGbl0rJFtL
  商品二维码:https://s1.locimg.com/2024/08/30/1dc018002279c.jpg
  微信售前售后群:https://s1.locimg.com/2024/08/30/7a4c79f2bd226.jpg
  小果 50-70g,中果 70-95g,大果 95 到 110 ，特大果 110-130(较少)
  依旧保质保量,大是大小是小,保证不会混发,也不会糊弄人,用别的品种忽悠人
  包装依旧是外硬纸盒.内泡沫,果子再套网套袋 
  箱装:
 10 斤中 75
 10 斤大 82
 10 斤小 48
 5 斤大 48
 5 斤中 43
 5 斤小 34
  礼盒: 
10 斤 87 
 5 斤 52
  	普通地区中通包邮,你要加顺丰了再联系我.
 	基本上每年中秋节前后就卖得差不多了,顺带提一嘴中秋是 9 月 17 号比往年在十一内早得多了,如果要送人最好提前个四五天,要预定礼盒可以留言?或者加那个群联系我,都是没有积货,单子多少从树上每天差不多摘多少.
 礼盒也没得差价,基本上就是箱装的加上礼盒包装的钱.自己吃我还是建议箱装就可以了.(毕竟也好装,礼盒是真的麻烦)
 	和香蕉放一起软得比较快,香蕉上面有催熟剂,但是基本上自然变软也够得上吃.
    
   
    
    福利环节: 还是和去年一样,每周送一箱中果,取楼层的随机数,9 月 6 第一次取值.然后往后延顺到卖光,2 周重复中奖延顺 1 层,也就是你可以中第 1,3 周,但是不能 1.2 连着来.
    
    下单福利:和去年一样,中果备注 V2,升级成大果
    
    最后祝大家身体健康,工作顺利,感谢各位的支持!]]></summary>

还有一点让我感觉不适的地方就是，他做什么都喜欢往你这边靠，走路要要贴过来，去吃饭明明可以坐在两侧，他偏偏要和你坐一侧。。。挤在一起弄的我难受。]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[不管上面想法有多好，但具体的执行方式让我很是恼火。平常维护交通秩序的交警是不会批罚单的，他们中的大多数是不会带着批条子的机器的（大概是因为管控得比较严，大多数辅警正警应该是没有权力开罚单的）。于是呢，每次要查头盔都是运动式的执法，专挑繁华路段，傍晚时分，一出动就是十数人，黑压压地站在路口四周，随时准备拉起人墙截住车流。何况这些交警的态度也算不上多好（毕竟他们觉得查头盔这事很正当，很可能把违逆的人视作刁民），不时能看到有人想要绕过去，然后几个彪形大汉一个箭步冲上去，这边拽住胳膊，那边拉住车把，还有一人迅速拔掉钥匙：路人纷纷侧目，不由得想起了某些港片中的场景；之后我去采访了一下那个被拦下的人，他回答我说，实在怀疑交警的根本动机，长这么大，第一次有了被压迫的感觉。这个时候路上骑电动车的，不少是吃过饭和家人一起出来转悠的，都开得很慢，所以反而最容易被交警抓住。他们的抵触情绪也是最大的：我开得又不快，真就是自行车的车速，你非要我跟那些车速追得上摩托的人遵守一样的法规，干嘛呀？
       我觉得问题出在一刀切上，应该严格区分电动摩托和电动自行车，对于能开到 40/50 码的电动摩托加大监管力度，同时给与一些权力，比如办电摩驾驶证就能与摩托车平权，可以上机动车道；对于电动自行车，严格限速，安装踏板，不可后座带人，然后别太强求头盔的事，说不定人家穿汉服呢？]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[项目背景：这段时间为实验室做了一个小项目，技术栈原本为 QT+Opencv+Mingw ，一切正常。但因为引入了 onnxruntime 所以转为 msvc2019C++编译器，自此噩梦不断。
问题描述：在 debug 其他问题后，目前遇到一个玄学 bug ，使用 QFileDialog 获取到了 QString 类型的文件路径，在使用 toLocal8Bit 转换为 msvc 编码的标注 string 后 opencv 的 cap.open 始终无法打开文件。我是使用了浑身解数也无法，只能来论坛求助大神了！
问题补充：我尝试过将 FFMPEG 的 dll 复制到可执行软件的同目录，配置系统环境还有重新编译 opencv 等方法，均无效果。
获取文件路径的代码：
    QString videoPath = QFileDialog::getOpenFileName(this, "打开文件", usedPath, tr("视频 (*.avi *.mp4 *.wmv)"));

调用 opencv 的代码：
    cv::String dir = std::string(videoPath.toLocal8Bit());
    // cap.open(videoPath.toStdString());
    cap.open(dir, cv::CAP_FFMPEG);]]></summary>

 Some background about me. I am a 3D artist studying computer animation in university, with a mostly Mac background who switched to Windows on the desktop because I built a gaming PC. I was getting more and more frustrated by Windows 11 because of how unstable it is getting for me. I decided to try Linux out after watching some behind the scenes videos of Pixar and Disney animating their movies and seeing that they use Linux machines to make their films. I was going "wait, whut?" I grabbed a spare laptop in the house and installed Fedora on it and played around and was having fun. I chose Fedora because Linux I wanted to run RHEL due to how my favorite programs like Maya, Blender, …]]></summary>

        <id>https://www.v2ex.com/t/1068854#reply0</id>
        <link href="https://www.v2ex.com/t/1068854#reply0"/>
        <updated>2024-08-29T14:10:40.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[《国产编程语言蓝皮书-2024 》作为该系列的第二版，根据前一版的经验和反馈，对编制方案进行了以下优化：
增加了英文版，以扩大国际影响力，中英文版本将同步发布，内容保持一致；
在项目申报资料中，为项目简介部分提供了建议内容清单，以促进项目展示的标准化；
延长了项目申报的时间，给予申报者更多的准备时间，直至 2024 年 10 月底。
编程语言是软件业的工业母机、编译器技术是信息产业的根技术，各种编程语言被用于操作系统、数据库管理系统、网络服务、工控设备、应用程序等的开发，渗透到了所有现代产业和服务领域。尤其是信息产业创新空间的持续扩展、系统复杂度的持续上升、开发成本的持续降低，都直接受益于不断涌现的编程语言和编译技术。
迄今为止，国内几乎没有出现被广泛使用的编程语言，这与我国世界性工业大国、科技大国的地位相去甚远。
国家政策层面，工业和信息化部发布的《“十四五”软件和信息技术服务业发展规划》中提到，应“强化基础组件供给……加快突破编程语言开发框架”；中国软件行业协会发布的《中国软件根技术发展白皮书（基础软件册）》第四章专门对编程语言和编译器的重要性、发展态势等进行了归纳。
这些政策文件的发布，为编程语言产业的发展提供了坚实的支持。随着信息技术的多年积累，我国已经形成了一个庞大的产业群体，对编程语言这一基础工具的需求日益增长。特别是在大语言模型、国产芯片等新兴技术领域的快速发展，对编程语言提出了更多新的需求。
回顾历史不难发现，与其他产业不同，作为信息产业的核心，编程语言的成功案例充满了偶然性。目前广泛使用的编程语言和开发工具，它们可能源自大型企业的商业推动，也可能源自个人或开源社区的创新。国内根软件行业呈现出项目高度分散化的趋势，企业和社区正在积极推动各种类型的编程语言项目，以满足不同领域的需求。
随着国家对软件和信息技术服务业的重视，以及对基础软件的大力支持，国产编程语言的发展迎来了前所未有的机遇。《国产编程语言蓝皮书-2024 》的编制，正是响应国家政策，汇聚国内编程语言创新力量的重要举措。
鉴于此，编程语言开放社区（ PLOC ）推出的《国产编程语言蓝皮书》，旨在全面收录并定期更新国内活跃且具有一定可用性的编程语言项目，为行业提供一个全面的国产编程语言概览。

记得几年前买家里的那只蓝猫时，原来猫主人就说等到了每年的亚宠展，就会带我们去薅羊毛，可以领到的东西非常的多，带个行李箱过去都会塞的满满当当的。
现场很火爆
去年参加了一次，今天参加了一次它博会，再加上这一次，全程下来，感觉很累很累，几千家的店铺分别在 W 系列馆，E 系列馆，N 系列馆，这所有的馆都走一遍，腿就已经酸的不行了，何况是每个馆都分布了几百家商铺，来来回回的兜圈。
像那种大型的宠物商家，如渴望，巅峰这种，是热门中的大热门，需要很早很早就来会场抢，我们 9 点多过去就已经晚了，而这几次的疯狂小狗，弗列加特，蓝氏等等，由于商家送的东西很多，所以就吸引了很多人过来排队打卡。有时候活动还没有开始，门口就排了很长很长的队伍，看着现场很拥挤，很吓人，但是活动是很有秩序的，派发的也很多快，所以队伍流通的也很快。
活动参与方式
大部分商家的活动形式就是关注，关注小红书账号，关注抖音账号，关注淘宝账号就可以，有一些商家会让发一些小红书的笔记，笔记中带有商家的话题或者是亚宠展的话题，还有一些是我比较喜欢的形式，就是做游戏，商家会在现场准备游戏场地，比如套圈，丢沙包，像今年有一些新的游戏形式如愤怒的小鸟弹弓，砸铁锤等等。本来大家都比较疲惫，有时候排队时间比较长，通过这种游戏与运气的方式，能够有效的环节疲劳，增加趣味性。
能薅到哪些羊毛
取决于商家的类型，像卖食品的一边都会送一些猫粮，狗粮的试用装，或者是猫条，冻干，湿粮等等，而像一些洗护用品会送一些除臭剂，洗护剂，一些药品公司会送一些驱虫的试用装。一些装饰公司送了一些猫猫狗狗用的喝水的折叠碗或者是类似于子弹头的便携袋子。现场最不缺的就是各种袋子了，就是印有自己商标的各种大的购物袋。
哪些人能参加
这个展每年都会举办一次，一般都是举办 4,5 天，前 3 天都是面向商家或者是专业观众的，后两天是面对消费者的。所谓的专业观众就是有猫猫狗狗的宠物店店主等，我理解的前面三天都是商家谈合作的，对于我们这种普通的猫猫狗狗的家长来说，一般就选在周六周天去。
除了薅羊毛还能干啥
有些人可能说，对于那些试用装我没有兴趣，我有钱，想买就直接买了，为什么要浪费时间去薅羊毛？其实，去参加这个展会，也是开阔自己眼界的一个方式，像去年认识了疯狂小狗这个品牌，从此就一直关注了它，发现它一直在举办各种宠物的活动，有时候有空了就会带宠物参加。
其次，现场也会有这种优质的宠物宝宝们，不仅有猫猫，狗狗，也会有各种比较小众的宠物，如安哥拉兔子，仓鼠，乌龟，蜥蜴，蛇等，看似小众，这些展位往往人山人海，大家都有猎奇的心理。比如说养蛇，你平时会比较会很少见到，但是在这个展会上你会见到来自全国各地来的宠物爱好者。
不过今年参加下来，明显感觉冷淡了很多，不仅能耗到的羊毛少了，而且周六去的，发现有些小场地商家已经开始撤场了，有的在做清仓大甩卖，也不难理解，商家们大老远的运这些产品来上海，也不想再付一笔运费又把它们运回去。]]></summary>

我用了那种专门脱下面的脱毛膏，脱其他地方没问题，但蛋蛋脱毛后会无比刺痛，走路都会疼那种，注意看一下会发现已经有点伤到皮肤与毛孔了，就想问下大家用什么方式脱毛，有没有不会那么刺痛和能够比较长久的方式/仪器？谢谢各位彦祖的回复]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I use a pretty nice gaming laptop from 2022. I was running Windows 10 for most of its life. And you could tell it wasn't happy. Maybe it was fine at the start, but recently it got to the point of reaching ~90°C just to LOAD the damn OS and like 60-70°C at idle on a good day. When I heard all the telemetry news, and when i saw how badly my laptop was taking windows, i had enough. It also helped that I'm a developer and switched to vim/nvim (still not sure which one i like more), and i use git bash all the time. And getting that to run on windows is just a hassle. On linux it's a breeze. Not to mention being fed up with the lack of customization for keybinds and general appearance.
 I spent one day. Backing up all my stuff. And then booted linux mint from a USB. Installed it, fiddled with the drivers/kernels (it still has some graphics/display issues unfortunately :/) and MAN... My Laptop hit record low temps, 50-60° idle, one time i saw even 43°! Everything is so quick to load and work with. Loving the command line way of doing things as well. I love the sense of security and calmness that comes with it all. I just feel at ease again. And i can focus on my work.
 I had to keep windows as dual boot unfortunately because of stuff required by my organizations. But still, I was able to allocate 280 gigs for linux and it runs like butter. Thank you ❤️

我们唯一目标，就是做出游戏，上线，赚钱！
你是否也想过，或者曾经想过，自己做一个游戏，上线，让很多人玩到你做的游戏。
又或者因为公司某些人能力不足，导致你喜提 N+1 ，从此想成为独立游戏开发者。
如果是，那这份专栏，就是为你准备的。
不管你有没有编程经验，无论是否从事过游戏行业工作，本专栏都将为你提供框架性的思路。
从如何学习，学什么，到产品构思方向，到开发，到上线，到接入广告赚钱，到后期运营，每一步，都会帮你理清思路，带你踏入独立游戏开发的世界。
本手册包含以下章节
我真的可以成为独立游戏开发者吗？
成为独立游戏开发者需要学什么，如何学？
一些系统的比较有用的学习资料推荐。
一个人做游戏，不会美术怎么办？
一个游戏的开发流程是怎样的？
一些有用的免费或付费资源（美术音频等）。
通过 AI 帮自己策划具体游戏内容。
游戏开发完怎样接入广告赚钱？
游戏开发完怎样通过资源礼包赚钱？
联网游戏如何申请备案号？
如何申请软著？
安卓版如何上架 TapTap 和好游快爆？
iOS 版如何上架 AppStore ？
如何增加游戏下载量？
玩家群运营经验分享。
个人开发者怎样注册及运营公司？
目标读者
本手册适用于符合下列条件的朋友
没有编程经验，但热爱学习
有编程经验，但没做过游戏
做出了游戏，但是不知道怎么上线，怎么赚钱
期望通过做游戏，赚点小收入
借机和大家交个朋友
自 2021 年被迫失业以来，我一直在做独立游戏，所谓独立游戏，不定是那些画面精美，玩法优秀的游戏才算是独立游戏，我觉得只要是未投入大量研发资金，一人或少量的人做的游戏，都可以称为是独立游戏。
有想法很简单，但是能把一个想法真正的地落地，上线，其实是很难的。有很多人想要做游戏，有的人已经开始学习了，有的人已经做出来了，有的人把游戏上线了，有的人不但上线了，还赚到了钱。这每步，都会有大量的人被刷下去。
有些事情很简单，但是如果没有做过，没有经验，没有看到别人是如何做的，那就要自己花费大量的时间去探索，去试错。
这份专栏中的内容，都是我的个人这几年每一个产品都要经历的事情。
这份专栏，提供的是入门的框架和方法论，提供的是方向性的东西，真正要靠游戏赚到钱，最终还是要靠你自己撸起袖子一行代码一行代码地去干。
做游戏，不保证一定能赚钱，但确实是一条天花板足够高的路子。]]></summary>

 I should add an obligatory disclaimer that Kubuntu 24.10 is an unstable development release and you should only upgrade to it if you know what you're doing. Otherwise, wait for its official release in October.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[只需简单的一键安装这个扩展，就可以恢复你在 VSCode 中熟悉的快捷键。
插件的核心功能：
移除以 cmd + r 为前缀的快捷键
恢复你在 VSCode 中已经学会的以 cmd + k 为前缀的快捷键
cmd + k：在 VSCode 中是快捷键前缀，但在 Cursor 中是"打开 ai 编辑"，现改为 cmd + e
shift + cmd + k：在 VSCode 中是 删除行，但在 Cursor 中是 打开 ai 编辑，同样改为 cmd + e
cmd + l：在 VSCode 中是 选择当前行，但在 Cursor 中是 打开新的 ai chat，改为 cmd + ]
cmd + shift + l：在 VSCode 中是 选中所有查找匹配项，但在 Cursor 中是 将选择插入 ai chat，改为 cmd + shift + ]
目前只支持了 macos ，windows 和 linux 会后序支持。

我在 C 从猫这里放了个电脑并设置了虚拟机，虚拟机是桥接模式，主电脑 ip 尾数是 69 ，虚拟机 ip 尾数是 34 。
现在有个很奇怪的点一，我手机在 C 从猫区域可以正常连接上 ip 为 34 的虚拟机，当我走到 a 主猫（已无缝漫游）这里的时候却再也不能连接上 ip 尾数为 34 的虚拟机了。只有重新走回 C 从猫区域的时候才能连接的上。
奇怪的问题点二，通过 Fing （这是一款网络扫描 app)在 a 主猫这里只能扫出 ip 尾数是 69 的主电脑 ip ，却扫不出 ip 尾数为 34 的虚拟机 ip
网段均是同一网段
各位如果的大佬帮忙诊断一下大概是什么问题]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm pretty new to linux as my daily system and most of my scripting has been used for small work tasks. 
 I just installed Pop Os and found the application Komorebi which is used for wallpapers and for my case live wallpapers. I came from windows as my daily driver and used Wallpaper Engine for this and was hoping to find a way to emulate that on my linux machine.
 I didn't want to have to go out and find downloads for videos to turn into wallpapers myself so I build a script that taps into the workshop directory of steam for Wallpaper Engine (installed using proton) and migrates them to Komorebi by making configs and extracting a frame for the thumbnail.
 This allows me to launch the wallpaper engine UI and use it to find wallpapers I want and then migrate them on demand.
 Obviously there will likely be bugs but I'm pretty proud of it.
 I put it up in my public repo and I'm going to continue to improve it where I can. If this is something you're interested in trying here's the link. Included a short video here to show the various wallpapers I pulled into Komorebi from Wallpaper Engine. I also have a link to a full demo in the github repo.

 Maybe 3 or so weeks ago I decided to install some Linux distro to a couple of laptops I have and they were gathering dust, so I couldn't care less if something brakes or something doesn't work. I started with a HP laptop, quite basic, just to try, and my surprise was how easy and painless the experience was (I started with Ubuntu and then moved to Linux Mint, and both were painless)
 After that I started to mess with the terminal and installing a lot of things and I really liked it. I was quite biased on using the terminal as I always remember Linux as pain, but nothing far from the reality. I have a little bit of dev experience and I don't mind researching …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[事情的经过就是去年买的小米空调，本地售后处理的很差很差。
关于这个空调也发了两个帖子，去年一个今年一个。
终于制冷效果不好的问题找到了。
耗时两年，本地这个小米空调的售后终于肯舍得找"技术"了。
技术称这个空调安装的位置距离天花板太近了，实际距离不到 5 公分。 意思就是上门安装的师傅没有按照规定要求安装。 
这个安装高度问题，之前问过这个上门安装的师傅，他说没有问题。
那么现实就是昨天移下来了，制冷也好了，空调风也大了。 现在省电的不得了，设置 26°，室温稳定 25.5~26° 连续测试了 24 小时没什么问题。
这安装师傅骗了两年，小米售后这个女的 口口声声说这个师傅是个工作了 7 8 年的老师傅了，不敢想。
目前本地售后对这件事没有任何歉意，这个女客服本来态度就一般，觉得用户在无理取闹，因为从之前的回复就能看出来，不懂硬要跟你犟一些没用的。
最后来个电话说了一句 啊，解决就行。就完了。 
你说找小米投诉吧，上门那些安装师傅，是不容易，大热天还得在外面吊着。 但你不能说你知道这个问题然后骗用户吧。]]></summary>

Skip is a tool that transpiles your SwiftUI iOS app into a Kotlin Jetpack Compose app, and enables you to use a single language to create a complete app that reaches the entire mobile marketplace.
What it is: Skip stands in contrast to other cross-platform development tools like Flutter, React Native, and Xamarin, in that it enables the creation of genuinely native applications for both of the dominant mobile platforms. It doesn't embed a separate engine or runtime into your app, but instead lets you use pure Swift and SwiftUI to create the iOS side of the app (as per Apple's recommended best practices for creating iOS apps), and transpiles it into a pure Kotlin and Jetpack Compose app for the Android side (which is…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi HN, We're excited to share repo2vec: a simple-to-use, modular library enabling you to chat with any public or private codebase. It's like Github Copilot but with the most up-to-date information about your repo.
We made this because sometimes you just want to learn how a codebase works and how to integrate it, without spending hours sifting through the code itself.
We tried to make it dead-simple to use. With two scripts, you can index and get a functional interface for your repo. Every generated response shows where in the code the context for the answer was pulled from.
We also made it plug-and-play where every component from the embeddings, to the vector store, to the LLM is completely customizable.
If you want to see a hosted version of the chat interface with its features, here's a link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNVzmqRXUCA
We would love your feedback!
- Mihail and Julia

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey r/linux,
 Nano is installed on most Linux systems nowadays since it has replaced vi as the default text editor in most distributions for years now. That means most of us are probably using it quite frequently, possibly without even thinking about it when it is called by default (e.g., when using visudo, or when editing a commit message for a git merge operation on a remote host we SSH'd into), but also some of us may be explicitly using it to edit remote config files, editing file as root even locally, or maybe even for programing?
 I actually do use it to program when I'm live coding in front of my students, because I can open it in tmux which allows me to have the same editor on my laptop's screen and on the big display my students see without having to duplicate screen so I can have other notes for myself for example (also, it's good for them to see that it is possible even in 2024 to code using simple tools that runs on your own computer rather that editing files directly on GitHub or wherever…).
 Because of that, I came to realize what an under appreciated gem nano actually is. Recent discussions on HN and here lead me to wonder how to showcase and discuss nano's features, so I thought why not share our .nanorc files?
 I'll copy mine in a comment below :).
 For those of you who never bothered to customize nano, be sure to check the `nanorc` man page, and to not miss its "REBINDING KEYS" section which lists the various and sometimes quite advanced editing functions most people ignore that nano has: syntax highlighting, line numbering, auto-indent, multi buffers, mouse support, keyboard macros, …
 So, do you use nano? What for? What does your .nanorc look like if you have one? What is your favorite nano feature?

I bought a latitude 5420 rugged (used Amazon refurb) and threw arch on it and I’m back in business. It’s fast it’s solid and it has already survived countless destruction attempts by my son.
 It’s worth a look if anyone is in a similar situation as me.

现在使用亚马逊 s3 ，但是感觉流量价格有点贵，对比下如果使用 vps 作为下载，然后写个服务动态给用户分配 vps 下载点，这个模式流量会节省很多。
现在有几个疑问
1 ，海外 vps 通常只标流量，但是没标带宽，他们默认带宽多少，对于下载服务器，厂商会对带宽限制么。
2 ，这算是自建 cdn 么？感觉之前应该有人也这么做，有成熟得解决方案嘛。]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[You don't hear the tonal inflections I would make if this was vocal. You would detect a half joking tone with a hint of sarcasm, confusion and surprise. So the title is intended as a colloquialism and not so much click bait. In candor, I think this is the tech fad of the month, Linux talk will slow down back to normal and maybe a marginally faster mid term growth. Linux being at 5.2% in 18 months is optimistic, but not unrealistic.
 There is so much pro-Linux and anti-Windows talk in tech communities that aren't even Linux or SOG centric, sure Level1techs made benchmarks, but a lot of other outlets are referencing it. Tom from "Moore's Law is Dead" says the Linux Desktop readyness is will be there in 5 to 10 years and we might be there by then and I expect somebody like him to be more skeptical than he was. Tom's Guide (different Tom) installed SteamOS on The ROG Ally X and there was better performance and battery life and DankPods. This is anecdotal, but I follow a variety streamer that I don't think I heard her talk about Linux ever and she tried streaming a Vtuber setup that uses Unreal Engine and heaven knows what and she streamed from the Deck from Proton and it was very choppy and I said "I think DXVK is compiling shaders and the more you do those effects, the bigger shader cache you'll get and it will stop chopping". The stream eventually crashed, but considering it's a handheld and it's going through all that translation, I'm surprised it ran that well even though it crashed. She plans on not doing that on the deck until AMD/Valve makes a encoder Driver for Windows.

说回主题，我上司可以说是完全“借鉴”了我的项目（他也知道我有这个项目，并看过），从核心技术栈，到向量数据库选型，到流程引擎驱动设计，甚至知识库生成方案都没有一点改动
更气的是，老板还真想落地试试做个 Demo ，我上司居然又想把活甩给我，用了我的方案，最后还要直接把我项目魔改一下完成他的 KPI ，我应不应该直接拒绝？毕竟我司独特的组织架构，他并不是我的唯一上司，也不一定能给我穿到小鞋，但是这么不给他面子，以后在公司抬头不见低头见也很尴尬]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello everyone,
 I’ve spent the last two weeks testing my new Chipolo One Point tracker with Google’s new Find My Device feature. I placed the tracker in my car, which was parked in a long-term parking lot at the airport. I was eager to see how often the tracker would be detected. I reported the tracker as missing in Find My Device and waited for a notification that it had been located. Well, I waited the full two weeks, and the tracker was only detected when I was back at my car. 
 It was only after this that I researched why the tracker hadn’t been detected even once. It turns out that in the Google settings, the owner of each individual phone must manually enable the option to find trackers and other Find My Device devices. By default, trackers are only found in highly frequented areas, where multiple devices detect the tracker simultaneously.
 The parking lot where my car was parked is visited by a relatively large number of people—most of the parking spaces were booked. Yet, my tracker was not detected even once.
 I wish I had placed an AirTag for comparison. I’m sure the AirTag would have been detected at least once, if not several times.
 I really thought the new Chipolo trackers would be a viable alternative to Apple AirTags.
 Unfortunately, Android trackers are useless to me in this regard.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey Hacker News!
Launching gptengineer.app into beta today.
It's like Claude Artifacts, but:
- you can edit the code in your fav IDE (two-way github sync)
- installs npm packages
- automatically picks up build and runtime errors and fixes them
- very fast, built with rust
The full stack capabilities are built on supabase (prefer to not have to handle auth + user data at this point so this is owned by the user)
The seed for this project was an open source experiment, posted about that previously here:
https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36422730
Would love feedback if you give it a try!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've created a powerful tool to help Go developers uncover the hidden giants in their compiled binaries. Go Size Analyzer is like an X-ray machine for your Go executables, revealing:
Which dependencies are eating up your binary size
Unexpected bloat from standard library or vendor packages
Size changes between binary versions with a visual diff
Key features that set it apart:
Interactive treemap visualizations (check out the demo: https://gsa.zxilly.dev)
Slick terminal UI for deep diving into package hierarchies
Cross-platform support (works on Linux, macOS, and Windows binaries)
Export to SVG for easy sharing and documentation or just visualize the CI process
Whether you're optimizing for edge devices, reducing Docker image sizes, or just curious about what's really inside your Go binaries, this tool provides detailed insights.

本人
本人在 web3 混迹 3+年。目前做零知识证明的电路开发，有时需要读读论文。主用 rust 三年多，个人自认为对 Rust 及生态比较熟悉，从服务端到性能优化到各种类型体操，语法和编译器行为的很多犄角旮旯也都碰过。unsafe 代码不多但是也有涉及。
最近比较迷茫，想转变方向，做一些更偏系统底层的东西。不过离开 web3 ，只有 rust 这个强项了。面试的是一家做云的公司，参加某活动认识的，当时有过 rust 的交流。得知他们想用 rust 改造老的部分组件，原本的系统几乎都是 C 写的，新开了岗位。自认为自己算是擅长 rust ，也挺熟悉社区，所以感觉还挺对口，了解意向后就投递了。

算是内推进来的。内推的人安排了初次的谈话。简单聊了经历，还做了简单的 rust 面试。问题包括：
Pin的作用。——防止内存移动，在接口上则体现为不让用户拿到&mut T
自己实现一个Future的伪代码。——写出来了。
RefCell大量使用时，是正常现象吗？使用RefCell有什么问题。——trait 设计不合理，在需要&self的方法上要改变内部状态。使用RefCell的使用要遵循借用的使用规则，不然会导致运行时 panic 。
算是都答出来了。
正式面试
总共 4 轮。
第 1 轮
先前本来就有了解过面试官，于是也没什么自我介绍。上来就写代码，是一个 TCP 的流处理：
要求：用户按user_id（ 3-byte ）、payload_len（ 3-byte ）和payload（长度根据前面的定）的格式来发送数据。每个 TCP 连接会源源不断地接收这类格式的消息。
后面又追加了新的要求：要求限流，每分钟只允许同一个user_id的最多 10 个请求，不同连接都要共享。超过就拒绝。
之前没有太多网络编程相关的经…]]></summary>

        <id>https://www.v2ex.com/t/1068568#reply2</id>
        <link href="https://www.v2ex.com/t/1068568#reply2"/>
        <updated>2024-08-28T13:45:57.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[大家好，给大家介绍一款桌面待办应用：Kite 待办
官方网站：kite.kitlib.cn
支持平台：Windows
想要清楚的规划每一天，一眼就能看清今天要做什么？
试试 Kite 待办 吧！设计简洁，无广告、无需登录，所有数据都安全地离线存储在本地。

核心功能：
总览视图：一览一个月的待办任务，支持批量标记完成和导出为 Markdown 或文本格式。
迷你浮窗：浮动窗口，随时查看和快速标记完成任务，提升效率。
番茄时钟 & 倒计时：自定义专注时间，设定提醒，帮助你高效完成任务。




为什么做这个？
不知道多少人要写日报周报，每次写的时候回忆自己做了什么，还有整理浪费很多时间。
然后找了一些待办清单整理自己做过的事情，但是要么功能很多不够轻便，要么就是连最基本的功能都收费。
秉着用着不爽就自己开发一个的心态，就这样又产生了一个程序员三件套之一的“待办” 😂
创意可能不多，但是一定要好用，人性化，所以先满足了自己的期待，自己用了一段时间，才决定将这个应用发布出来！
本应用基础功能完全免费，数据存在本地，不限制条数，支持快捷导入导出。
欢迎提建议，有用且好做的需求会尽力（摸鱼）实现。
未来会做什么？
根据大家的反响，如果用的人多，应该会持续迭代~
可能会发布 MacOS 版本（前提是能盈利，苹果开发者账号也不便宜），做数据同步，或者对接 AI 生成日报周报这些。
用到了什么技术？
用的 Tauri 开发，UI 用的 shadcn-vue （基于 Tailwind CSS ）
🌟 如果你觉得好用，决定继续用下去，欢迎在评论区写下您的评价（会给这个应用更多的曝光机会，也会激励我持续更新），谢谢~]]></summary>

现在想再买一款千元左右的人体工学椅。主要给爱人用（ 168cm, 63 公斤，不过最好别限制死，万一我也要坐一下😂）。不考虑躺平午休之类的，身体椎间盘突出，重点关注腰部支撑情况。

另外我看现在 500 以上几乎都是腰背分离，但是小红书上有评价腰背分离下腰没支撑不如全背。这部分不知道有没有同学有了解的。]]></summary>

 I was just reading the difference between two. I stumbled upon this aritcle. As per article - 
 By default, the apt upgrade command removes old versions of installed or upgradeable packages on the system that are no longer needed when upgrading.
 In contrast, the apt-get upgrade command does not. This efficiency can make apt upgrade better for freeing up system memory.
 I don't think this is the case. The packages "no longer needed" can only be removed with autoremove subcommand after both. There is no auto removal of anything.

 This causes Wayland to be borderline unusable: Weird glitches, horrendous performance, sometimes just not working, etc...
 And I have seen quite the amount of people with roughly the same setup as mine complain about this issue, so I am just wondering if this is an issue that will ever be resolved? I would really really love to use Wayland, but x11 seems to be my only choice currently.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[好啦好啦我知道已经有很多类似的帖子了（今天早上 Google 了「 site:v2ex.com 女朋友生日送什么好」了以后浏览完了 57 篇帖子···）但是不同时间提问 回答的人会不同嘛
女朋友下周就要 28 岁了（划掉，18 岁），爱好一下子能想到的有：玩游戏（端游）、“她说蓝色是她最爱的颜色”、玉桂狗、荔枝（水果）
ℹ️几个她最近提过的点：
❶久坐腰不舒服——但这也是我的困惑 而我自己都一直没能发现什么好的解决方法（除了不久坐）
❷在某一个晚上突然提过想要去拍一套什么写真，但这个还得确认她到底要不要去拍，如果真的要去拍或许可以当成礼物？
❸还提过想要下次见面的时候点香薰（所以需要买香薰），但这个因为要一起享用所以应该不能算作单方面的礼物叭···
过去送给过她的礼物：一个蓝色的 Xbox 无线手柄（后来才知道她自己已经有一个有线的 Xbox 手柄了···）、玉桂狗的内衣、蓝色的围巾、手写贺卡
她送给过我的礼物：加盖她唇印的手写贺卡、她自己、潘多拉的对戒（当时因为样式我没有很喜欢所以···没有要）、LV 的手链（太贵重了！所以也没有要）、书包钱包等等她想给我买但是我也没有要，因为感觉不是很需要耶
所以她应该不需要很“贵重”的礼物，她自己的一个发卡都要两千多欧（实际上她说我送什么她都喜欢，从之前送过的礼物来看确实是这样）
🙂‍↔️这次生日「不太考虑」送的礼物及原因：
❶香水：因为想要送给她的香水(Jo by Jo Loves)希望她当场闻过喜欢后再买给她
❷拍立得：因为有计划明年年底前去日本迪士尼，所以打算之后去日本旅游的时候再买（疑似🫓我知道）
❸酒水：57 篇帖子里有人提到过送酒水其实我也不太知道为什么···女朋友不跟我在一起的时候其实不喝酒，所以即便考虑到女朋友喜欢荔枝可以考虑荔枝酒，但这应该也会因为只有跟我在一起的时候才喝从而没办法算作单方面的礼物吧···（类似香薰）
❹ Watch：理由类似香水，虽然因为女朋友月经不是很准，确实希望她可以利用手表来预测排卵期（已经确认她习惯戴表），但即便这样也需要她当场试戴确定了喜欢的样式以后才能买，而且我自己也想换新了，所以在等比较值得买的一代（顺便等我工作了就可以用自己的工资给她买了）
❺双人游：感觉我目前不太有 cover 掉全程全款的能力（虽然有意向目的地 但是单单双人双程机票就要£550 呜呜呜）
❻闪现：有考虑过下周直接飞过去，但是她会加班，所以就只能还是视频了···
❼清空购物车：感觉她不是很需要我给她花钱···]]></summary>

买回来后不常出远门，用的次数不多，虽然已经将近八年了，但是平均一个月不超过 5 次循环。
大概从上个月开始，发现充不满电，最后一格电要冲很长时间，而且其中一节电池会发热，搜索都说是这一节电池快要坏了，隔膜开始漏电了，建议放电后扔掉。
干脆把 6 节电池全部测了一遍，新电池应该是 3500mah ，结果是 2 节只剩 800mah ，2 节接近 4.2v 时会发热，1 节剩 2000 多 mah ，还有一节没有测完。剩余 2000mah 可以接受，低于一千毫安时和发热的情况实在是太崩了]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[背景
女朋友是今年的应届生，普通本科 视觉传达设计专业，父母在北京这边做点小生意，我也在北京，所以她实习就在北京，工作也在这儿找。
水平在我看来是挺不错的，不管是平时那些设计作业，还是最后的毕业设计，我看了都觉得眼前一亮，在她们专业成绩也一直是第一名。
知道这个学历和专业实在算不上好，所以预期并不高，大厂只是投一下简历凑个热闹，主要还是在找小公司 10k 以下的设计类工作，没想到这种要求了，还这么难。
主要经过
3-5 月
在一家在线教育公司的平面设计岗实习，公司比较大，也比较规范，虽然钱不多，她干得挺开心，领导们评价也不错。5 月底回校准备毕业展的时候，跟领导确认无法转正，没有坑位，很洒脱地就辞了，想着毕业之后再找。结果，这一找，就找到了现在。
6 月至今
6 月份的时候我没怎么问，她自己也想先玩几天，有一搭没一搭地投简历，自然是没什么结果。进入 7 月份，她就有点急了，本来投的还都是上家公司那种规模的（ 1000+），无果后开始投各种小公司，结果还是没回音。
我们俩商量，不行了，得换策略。
不局限于文化行业了，各种行业的，但凡是个设计岗，都投。
大部分岗位动辄要求两三年工作经验，所以现在就不在乎薪资了，只要能入职，工资低无所谓，积攒点工作经验以后再跳。
有效果，陆续开始收到面试了，大多都是 10-50 个人的公司，给的薪资也都是 5-6K 。陆陆续续参加了十几次面试，结果，竟然一个都没能找到。我给大家挑几个典型的说一下：
几个典型
新型书店：早 10 晚 7 、偶尔出差、双休、五险一金、7K
这是最想去的一个，公司实际上是个 书店+咖啡店+会场服务 的模式。排除掉服务员厨师什么的，算上老板一共就不到十个人。
第一轮面试的时候，跟面试官聊得很好，面试官都让准备好入职手续了，说问下老板意见，应该没有大问题，结果老板要求加一轮面试。
老板的那场面试，女朋友说全程没捞着说话，老板从工作内容讲到国家经济发展形势，又讲到人生哲理和对年轻人的殷切嘱托，然后就结束了，可以走了。
第一轮的面试官说，老板有些其他顾虑，但是她本人非常认可，所以她会帮忙再争取下。然后，就没信了。
打印店：早 8 晚 8 、单休、五险、7K
说是某某文化公司，实际上是个大一点的打印店，所以会接一点帮小公司做点宣传册的设计工作。在招聘软件上确认了上述条件后，去现场面试了。
出来面试的是打印店老板，对上述谈好的条件都不清楚，从头开始谈。PUA 一番后说工资 6K ，女友表示接受之后他突然说，刚才看错了，以为是有两年经验，没想到是个刚毕业的，那 6K 就不行了，只能给 4K 。再次表示接受之后，又说，工作时间不固定，只要店里有顾客就不能下班，五险一金统统没有，说团队培养新人也要成本云云。
能看出来，人家就是不想要，所以也没有再纠缠。
传媒公司&电玩城：早 11 晚 10 、月休 4 天、五险、5K
老板有个电玩城，还有个传媒公司。所以去了之后既要给电玩城设计优惠券宣传图，还要给传媒公司设计些海报。从这个工作时间也能看出来还得兼电玩城服务人员。
去面试，一开始，老板和副总就架个手机在那儿拍我对象。自我介绍完了之后，一边调整手机一边让重新说一遍，拍完之后两个人就走了，剩个戴眼镜的男的面试。问了包含星座血型 MBTI 等各种信息，让我对象详细介绍了自己的家庭情况和人生经历，然后开始点评。对象一边哭一边跟我复述他那些油腻到让人不适的发言，我都能想象这个老男人是用什么样的眼神打量眼前的年轻女孩。
我的感受
不找了，找个屁，这些狗屎工作工资还没我的零头高。我知道这是社会中的大多数，我也不是想抱怨，我只是觉得，我实在没必要让我对象吃这样的苦。她在家爱干啥干啥，网上接单作图一个月也能赚两三千了。
但是她接受不了。
好歹也是个本科生，她想不通为什么找个本专业的工作这么难，也接受不了自己只能做这样的工作。我想劝劝她，可最后也只能长叹一声，咋办呢？各位老哥？]]></summary>

 I love it. It's faster, it's snappier, it take up way less storage, and because I installed it without any experience in installing operating systems, it made me face some challengesbthat I never thought I would ever successfully face, such as partitioning.
 I am never going back to windows, and I'm happy to become a Linux user at last. Now I can finally use my laptop without having to restart every 2½ hours, and not having to reinstall every 9 days.
 I hope to learn a lot more about coding and computers through Linux, and to try my hand at making thing I never thought I could before.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, when looking at a list of hardwares in a computer, for example a DIY PC:
  
Intel I5-12400 cpu, with base frequency 2.5ghz
 16GB ddr4 2666mhz memory
 512GB Samsung ssd storage, with 4000-5000 MB/s read/write speed.
  
or a macbook pro, or something else.
 The cpu speed usually indicates the calculation speed, memory speed indicators the read/write large in-memory data speed, the storage indicates the file read/write speed.
 But how could I know, the speed of linux write system call speed? for example the terminal print speed?

Pop Shell is still maintained as part of Pop!_OS 22.04 LTS. It is not being maintained for 24.04 LTS, and support for the GNOME 42 (which 22.04 LTS shipped with) will end when 22.04 LTS becomes end-of-life, which is April 2027 to match Ubuntu

The Pop Shell's proposal about upstreaming it to GNOME is not active anymore. As far as I'm aware, the upstream GNOME team is not interested in implementing something as complex as Pop!_Shell. They are, of course, welcome to use our code under the open-source license, but we've always had to put in a lot of work to keep up with the latest GNOME changes, and Pop!_Shell already has some problems on newer versions of GNOME that have not shipped in Pop!_OS.

 Sub-Consequences
  
As Forge is unmaintained, there are soon no more maintained fully featured GNOME tiling window manager

As is typical, we are occasionally told what new "thing" will now be leveraged by the cyber team to meet their goals (in addition to existing best practices that we do on our own to ACTUALLY make the platforms secure).
 I just found out that we will now (edict from on high) be running MDE on all things. How wary should I be? Is it as horrid as MOST products from MS are? Does anyone have any experience running it in a large enterprise?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[先介绍下背景，坐标欧洲，家宽是墙上 RJ45 网口直接 DHCP 获取公网静态 IPv4 ，无 IPv6 ，这个 IPv4 似乎是跟着 MAC 地址的，只要 MAC 地址不变，这个公网 IPv4 就不变。平时插着一个小米路由器来用。
然后我有台旧的 ThinkPad ，运行 Win10 ，Windows Update 一直开着的，平时一直都会更新到最新版。很多年了一直 24 小时运行，当个服务器用，平时跑些东西，没跑 HTTP ，也有在路由器上映射一些端口方便公网直接访问，主要是 3389 和 SSH （ Windows 自带的 OpenSSH ），当然在公网上的端口不是 3389 和 22 ，不过现在这似乎并不重要，人家都是直接扫服务的。还有一些其它端口是做 Tailscale 的跳板，也就是把我的 Tailscale 其它一些设备的一些端口通过这台 ThinkPad 跳到公网上，方便在外面不需要通过 Tailscale 来直接访问我的 Tailscale 网络中的一些设备。直接用的是 Windows 的 portproxy 。
很多年了一直很稳定，这 ThinkPad 从来没死过机，没出过问题，平时基本就在旁边吃灰。
然后今年 6 月 24 日我回国休假，记得 6 月 25 日我还在国内试着连了下这 ThinkPad 的 3389 ，看看速度啊啥的，也没用来干啥事。然后 26 号以后就连不上了，Tailscale 也显示这台机子离线。当时我也没管，因为想着可能死机了或者网崩了啥的，无所谓了到时回去了再看看怎么回事。
然后今天刚回到欧洲，诡异的事情来了！！！！！
第一件事是先发现 WIFI 上不了网，手机能连上小米路由器 WIFI ，但是无网络，登后台页面说 DHCP 无响应。以为路由器出了什么幺蛾子，第一时间重启路由器嘛，还是不行。
然后看了下 ThinkPad ，发现 ThinkPad 死机了，按大小写灯不亮，屏幕也不亮，先没管，想着先去弄好网络先，看看网络怎么回事
插拔了几次网线/重启路由都提示 DHCP 无响应，于是试试直接把网线插电脑上，但是网线插我电脑上又能获取到 IP 能正常上网，第一反应是路由器 WAN 口的 MAC 地址被运营商封了？然后路由器 WAN 口改个 MAC 地址，马上能获取 DHCP 能上网了，但是没过几秒又断网了，然后 DHCP 又获取不到地址了，像是被秒封了（划重点！）。
这时无意间看到 ThinkPad 连着的交换机灯在狂闪（ ThinkPad 通过一个千兆有线交换机连到小米路由 LAN 口，此时交换机上没有除了 ThinkPad 和小米路由之外的设备），这时还是死机状态，连的显示器不亮，按大小写键盘灯不亮，风扇也不转说明 CPU 不热），于是我长按电源键强行关机重启了下 ThinkPad 。一重启网马上就正常了，小米路由 DHCP 马上有响应，马上能上网，甚至路由 MAC 地址都没改，然后改回路由默认的 WAN 口 MAC 地址也能正常上网正常获取 IP 了，一切都恢复正常了。
妈也，细思极恐，不知道是不是我的 ThinkPad 被黑了有人做肉鸡一直 DDoS 啥的然后导致一插网线就被运营商封？现在我也还原不了现场了，ThinkPad 重启后一切都正常了，不知道当时交换机灯狂闪在那闪什么，早知应该当时直接把路由器 WAN 口插电脑上然后开 Wireshark 抓个包。
看了下 ThinkPad 的 Windows 日志，系统那一栏没有什么异常，到 6 月 26 号晚上 19 点之后就没有了，像是突然死机的那种。
然后安全那一栏能看到很多登录失败的，像是 3389/SSH 被爆破

以前也遇到过也没什么，我也没弱密码，单纯爆破应该发生不了这些事情
对了，这台 ThinkPad 上还装有火绒，基本上只打开了文件监控和下载防护，火绒没杀到什么毒，今天也 Windows Update 了一波，那个恶意软件删除工具也没杀到东西。简单看了下进程啥的都没有异常。
这一切事件太诡异了，首先之前这么久从来没出过问题，稳定得一逼，偏偏在我回国休假第二天出的问题（难道我被搞了？），然后死机就死机吧，这死机的时候交换机灯还狂闪还搞得上不了网，虽然我不知道是不是真的是 ThinkPad 发出什么有问题的包被运营商封，但是一强行关机重启马上就正常。而且当时确实路由器改 WAN 口 MAC 地址之后得了这么几秒，然后又一模一样的现象了，直到重启 ThinkPad ，真的太诡异了。
害，有没有哥们支下招，有什么要检查的，最好能查查到底发生了什么]]></summary>

10 年前，也就是 2014 年，反斗软件的站长在 V 站发帖，说自己对自己的网站有很多疑惑，不知道自己该不该坚持下去。
下面的第一条评论：「现在都是快餐时代，你慢慢做只会做死」，就给这个网站判了“死刑”。
但显然站长后来的选择是继续做下去。

2020 年
又过了 6 年，也就是 2020 年。反斗软件的站长，又在 V 站发帖说不知道自己该不该继续做反斗软件。
下面的评论也几乎都是消极的。
但显然的显然，站长后来的选择还是继续做下去。

2024 年
又过了 4 年，时间来到了 2024 年。反斗软件依然还在正常运行。
不禁感叹，有时候旁人的言语并不能阻挡一个人的热情和坚持。
希望每一个怀揣情怀和梦想的人，都能坚持做自己，最终获得成功。]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[唉，最近事事不顺，再加上因为我自身原因和异国恋女友在分手边缘，真的有点撑不下去了，偏偏她又是我最好的朋友，我甚至找不到另一个合适的人倾诉，于是想来发潜水那么久的第一个贴。
看了一下存款也完全不是自己能安心的数字，冷静下来还是想要先走好自己的路，自己已经到了 29 的边缘，也看到了其他相似经历的朋友的帖子，实在有点迷茫，所以还是想想听听大家的看法。
个人情况
18 年某 985 计算机科班毕业，本校研没保上，次一级外校有资格但是自己好高骛远放弃了去考 THU ，结果复试被刷；本科期间技术积累不足，不太敢面大厂，第一份工作去了一个初创公司做嵌入式，做了一年不太喜欢工作氛围和领导画饼，再加上依旧想深造，就辞职到离家很近的一个车企做车联网相关的 App 开发工作了，想着应该有时间在职备考，结果前两年几乎忙疯，第三年遭遇电信诈骗直接损失了近 20W （别骂了），没敢跟家里说，接近 2/3 的积蓄都没了。去年项目开始缓过来，也有女友远程加持，拼 PKU 软微还是倒在一路神仙分数之下。唉，现在一想自己完全没有赶上互联网红利末班车，还真是一步错，步步错了。
工作情况
目前在做的工作主要还是 App 相关开发，技术栈主要包含 Objective-C 、Swift 、Swift UI 、Flutter ，以及一部分 Unity ，在部门相当于干主管活，但实际无人可管。公司目前落地的 App 都是属于品牌车主+车友圈+商场整合型的 App ，相关业务涵盖车联网、社区、以及商品交易，访问量还可以，但感觉技术难点基本不在我们前端/客户端。
目前公司整体业绩在下降，部门已经经历了两次降薪。
目前想法
有离职想法，但比较纠结时间。其实之前工作也还算不错，离家比较近，降薪前收入在当地也还可以，两边父母也都满意，但是这几年真的改变了很多，很多福利都没有了，甚至政府的人才补贴都欠了我两年，现在感情出现问题，也越来越不想待了。可能其他地方也差不多，但是我真的感觉自己被困住了，想逃离这里。可能视精神状况和感情状况再考虑要不要裸辞，如果情况依旧还在变坏，我想我也需要 gap 一段时间再重新出发。目前主要还是不知道最近的下一步应该怎么走。想了一些可能的选择：
继续深耕 iOS/Flutter 开发（有经验但前景未知）
扩展后端赛道（有助于求职但经验少竞争多）
扩展 AI 算法赛道（热门但难度高）
尝试远程工作（如感情问题解决会很方便两人发展但存在语言和薪金保障问题）]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[为什么会产生这个问题？
因为我写了一个有问题的代码，大概长下面这样
# 如下是一个简单的循环
l = ['abc' ,2 ,[1, 2, 3]  ,4]
for i in l:
    print(i)
    l.remove(i)
print(l)

最后的输出是
abc
[1, 2, 3]
[2, 4]

踩坑的原因是，在遍历的时候，我根据一些条件去删除列表中的元素，然后偶然发现输出与我的预期并不符合。
原本的理解是next会依次返回后面一个元素，因此现在这个元素我删了也没事。
但是事实显然不是这样，列表产生的迭代器返回值好像是根据索引返回的
大模型的回答不同模型直接存在差异，因此在翻了一些 blog ，有一篇里面有句话如下所示
==迭代器本身并不存储任何数据项，存储的只是一个指针，该指针指向可迭代对象中真正存储的数据项，它指向当前被遍历到的数据项索引位置，下一次遍历则向后推进这个位置==
所以再次来求助一下，迭代器的 next 是按照索引来获取数据的吗]]></summary>

之前论坛也有过讨论1.23 的新特性 range over func 帖子，帖子评论也说新特性有好有坏。
而且 Go 也有过从 1.21 开始不支持 Win7 的例子，虽然可以撤销数个 commit 让 1.21 、1.22 重新支持回 Win7 ，具体操作在这个帖子的第 22 楼和第 23 楼，但这总归不是好办法。
说不定哪个新版本就会导致现在旧的“屎山”代码不能编译或不支持旧系统，所以想问一下大伙用 Go 写程序时会追新版本吗？追大版本还是追小版本？

优化点(难点、亮点)
代码中优化点用了 redis 预减缓存，随机比例获取奖品，高并发场景拦截大部分用户，乐观锁，mq 直接异步化发放奖品。基本上整个流程不会与数据库进行交互，瓶颈点几乎可以说是没有。这种架构，支撑百万，千万 qps 一点问题都没有。
核心发奖流程
public boolean grantPrize(String phone, String activity) {
        if (StringUtils.isAnyEmpty(activity, phone)) {
            throw new RuntimeException(ERROR_MSG);
        }

        // phone 为幂等键
        String key = StrUtil.format(ACTIVITY_PHONE_LOCK, activity, phone);
        boolean success = RedisUtils.tryLock(key, redissonClient, () -> {

在某个节点上，容器进程 A 默认是将数据包发给容器进程 B ，考虑到进程 B 升级，需要将流量转到其他机器上。
尝试
使用 ebpf 劫持 connect 系统调用可以做，以及使用 tc-ebpf 实现 nat ，但是被否了！理由是不够安全，存在影响其他容器的风险。
有大佬说可以使用 tc mirror 将流量镜像到 tun ，走隧道，发给本地进程 B 的就 drop 掉（暂时还没弄明白，可不可行，有无大佬解答）
iptables contrack 被禁止使用，导致无法使用其 nat 能力。
求问实现如上功能的方式]]></summary>

目前又刚从转转收了一台机子，下单前客服确认是 MIUI 的系统，但拿到手仍然是 HyperOS 。要退货再购买吧，这段时间折腾下来，觉得再也不可能从靠谱的渠道收到仍然是 MIUI 系统的 K60 了。想要自己尝试解锁降级，看了网上的一些分享，似乎之前的方法目前已经没有把握一定会成功了。担心最后不行错过了 7 天的退货期，最终砸在自己手里。所以，现在也很犹豫。
不知道有没有其他 K60 的用户最近有过解锁降级的经历，想要了解下。
人各有志，我能够理解很多人习惯了买来的房子原先的装修是什么样都一直那么住下去，也能够理解很多人习惯了安装的输入法默认的单行候选只有 5 个也就那么一直用下去，但我是喜欢根据自己的需要来折腾的人，所以，就用不着劝我“这年头正经人谁解锁刷机”了。]]></summary>

以为是静电保护，尝试给主板放电以及清扫和插拔内存条无果。致电客服，客服表示已经过了两年保修期，目前维修需要自费，无法开机算二级维修，要 1500 左右，不如买新的。
但是 NAS 这东西深度与厂家绑定，组了 RAID 要从威联通换到群晖要麻烦死，最主要我现在威联通还开不了机。
我对于威联通的槽点在于：
第一，卡。除了开机和关机太慢之外，内存和 CPU 感觉都不太行，Docker 一点都不敢开。
第二，配置比群晖还是麻烦不少。
第三，威联通客服整体服务态度、交付水平和响应时效都很差。同时降价太可怕，我 20 年 7 月京东买的，当年双十一就降价了 30%。
想问问大家，这种情况你们觉得我要换成群晖吗，还是继续买威联通一生黑。如群晖，求推荐群晖型号。]]></summary>

结果是几天看了十一套房，无一满意。
 
第一和第二套，复式楼梯房，建成十年。
 
墙皮掉的满地都是，各种杂物，排除。
 
第三套，近五年的房子，状态可以。
 
柜子小，缺一台空调，其他空调都是五级能效，家具不搭。排除
 
第四套房，缺一台空调，空调五级，不太干净，临街车声大。
 
第五，六，七，八套，十几年的老房子，在一个小区，江边位置好，都没收拾，全是杂物，家电老旧，屋里还有几罐药酒，电梯间老旧，有的灯都坏了，排除。
 
第九套，近两年的新房，家具新，但是隔音好差。我手指敲了下墙，卧室具体有两面墙是木板隔着的，不晓得为了什么，一敲都是空心。
 
第十套，江边，位置好，交通好，老小区，但是阳台小，空气不对流，邻居炒菜听的一清二楚，外面路边驾校车的大喇叭听的一清二楚。
 
第十一套，采光不好，隔音不好，隔壁好像是合租，而且关系还不好，因为墙壁都贴了纸条“进门穿拖鞋，我刚拖的地！”
 
太难了 已经不知道找哪里了
十一套房子有几大明显的缺点
1 空调冰箱 基本都是很耗电的那款
2 不少房子柜子都是很小的，聊胜于无，完全不够放东西
3 很多房间没有收拾]]></summary>

GooglePlay 账号是 A ，是美区账号
AppleMusic 账号是 B ，是土耳其账号,里面买了很多周杰伦
现在情况很迷，applemusic 正常登录后在库里看不到已购买的专辑。手动搜索周杰伦的专辑，并点击播放后提示让我进行订阅。
我点击改区后提示我当前区还有余额（是之前购买的土耳其里拉礼品卡），不给我转区。
这种情况我还咋整？是需要我必须在土耳其网络下登录 AppleMusic 账号才能正常访问歌曲库吗。]]></summary>

 I want to get my hands dirty and this might be a weird way of doing it, but I wish to install old compromised programs on a vm and explore why I can't exploit it when selinux is turned on. It would be helpful if someone could point me in the right direction.
 Thank you!

在深圳混了几年，到老家省会混了两年，认识了个妹纸在交往。有车没房，搞 PHP 的，现在失业了。
由于平时做了些产品项目在运营小程序，毕业后这几年手上不到 200 个 w ，想躺平确实也很难。
很迷茫，啥也不想干，看了招聘岗位极少工资还低，也不想找工作。就是感觉上班很没意思，在家呆了一个月多月了。
想法
买房结婚
最近又想着是不是先买房结婚解决人生大事.
听说省会的房子很多腰斩了，四五十万能买一套，也纠结是不是入手的好时机, 以后会不会继续降。
找工作
不容乐观，看了下 boss 没几个职位，都是几千块。上班上够够的，也懒得找了

创业
想依靠技术创业，一时半会没有好的想法，感觉也是困难重重。]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So I downloaded Fedora because I heard it was good for beginners. Plus, it's what Linus uses (im not a simp, trust me). I'm using the KDE desktop cause it looks the best out of the others. My first thought after using it for 5 hours is, wow, its so flipping fast. In fact, I was getting a headache by how fast everything was moving, from app changes to opening softwares and stuff and it's beautiful. I even felt like I had to be serious when navigating on this OS. Now, I'm trying to RICE it and am excited to share my desktop with you soon.
 What set my mind on changing the OS was how incredibly boring windows was, and I heard linux was good for software developers. Plus, I had some bitlocker issues yesterday, which set my mind to 10000% certainty of changing.
 So in summary: 6/5 stars for linux

I was following a tutorial on how to dual boot it with Windows 11, and it went well, until the grub menu came. I tried getting into the GUI, but got initeamfs unpacking errors. And couldn't even access windows, so I tried random things in the command line until I got access and deleted everything, from disk allocation to others. 
 Lesson learned today: No shortcut and learn the basics.
 I still want a customizable distro to use that's hopefully easier to install. Any recommendations?

Many of the apps that I want to use are X86 Native Debian apps and ran into frustrations getting them onto a Raspberry Pi based Desktop since the Pi is an Arm Machine. Now the Pi Foundation has an X86 Distro for older laptops. Does that run smoothly? Im looking for the Reaper Audio app, Signal, the Steam Store if possible and Waydroid for Android APKs. Anybody have success with using the PiOS on a regular laptop and not just the Raspberry Pi? Or would I be better off with user friendly distros like Ubuntu, Pop or Mint?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[如题，本人使用 MacBook Pro （ macOS Sonoma 14.1 ），因为出门不想带接收器、接口不够用等原因，想找一款鼠标长期在蓝牙模式下使用。
因为 macOS 的毛病，大多数蓝牙鼠标会不跟手，所以我的需求是回报率高，不飘。
测试回报率可以用这些网站（建议使用 Chrome 浏览器）：
https://devicetests.com/mouse-rate-test
https://www.sqlsec.com/mouse/
我目前用的 Razer orochi v2 蓝牙只有 90Hz ，用蓝牙明显感觉到不太稳。
网上听说刺鳞树蝰、ROG 战刃、月刃的表现不错，但似乎也没人测试过回报率。如果有用这些鼠标的朋友不妨测试一下。
如果也能测试一下 iPad 下的表现就更好了。我的鼠标在连接 iPad 时也非常飘，而同样是蓝牙，Magic trackpad 就很稳，不知道是不是大家也这样。
先谢谢各位了。]]></summary>

 And I'm sitting here with my friends being astounded. I cannot imagine myself using windows. Everything is worse and counterproductive. Heck even filemanager doesn't have tabs (as of windows 10) forget about ftp, nfs, sftp, ssh, like dolphin. You can install apps that simulate krunner but its nowhere as good. And not to even mention compiling anything on windows or drivers situation. On linux everything works ootb on windows not so much. Package managers like chocolatey work but they're shadow of what normal package manager is on linux. I had simple qt app that i wanted to compile for windows and after bashing my head against the wall and repeatedly kicking myself in the balls for week i gave up because its simply not possible.
 But hey, games work i guess? I genuinely can't fathom using windows for work compared to linux heck osx even

It also supports strict interfaces for modules by overloading `__all__`.
The core static analysis is done in Rust, so all Tach commands run quickly.
The goal of Tach is to help eng teams maintain velocity while scaling quickly, something we've seen break down a number of times. Give it a try!

相对中心的区域，离大城市（北上广深）以及部分新一线城市（成都、重庆、杭州、苏州、西安、厦门、三亚）都不算很远，最好是高铁 5 小时内（理想是 3-4 个小时），飞机 2 小时内，且有直飞（理想是 1-1.5 个小时）能到的地方。
气候适宜，夏天不是很热（受不了例如深圳那样夏天 35-40 高温且湿度大闷热闷热的）最好能在 30 度以下；冬天不会特别冷，0 度以上为佳（老婆受不了像北方那种零下十多度的冷），10 度左右最好
城市相对发展不错，机会适当且创业环境还可以（最好能有一些政府政策上面的优惠）
房价适中，不算非常高的，当然越便宜越好
旅游城市，美食等为可选，有最好没有也不会太大影响。
前两条属于重点。
现在暂时觉得长沙不错，另外有可能考虑的就是重庆，但都不算非常理想的地点，不知道有没有人给些建议。]]></summary>

3.使用 clash for Windows 的 Linux 版本 V0.20.21 版本，在 Linux 系统中不登录网关，测速时会有部分节点有速度，然后在测速网站上发现 ipv4 是梯子节点的 ip ，ipv6 则有时是学校的 ip ，有时梯子节点的 ip 。
问题：为什么 Linux 系统不登录网关也能让 clash 有速度？这样不就得到了一个不需要花钱的，兼备 ipv4 ，v6 的，自带魔法的校园网？

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I see a lot of people on this subreddit who prefer to have phones with as much computing horsepower as possible. I totally get this on other devices like desktops and laptops, but I feel out of the loop regarding cell phones.
 I use a pixel which are notoriously "underpowered". And while the phone does have issues, I don't know that having faster CPUs would fix those issues. Better efficiency and an improved modem would be nice, but I don't game on my phone. To me, it feels like faster phones are already offering diminishing returns compared to the speed boosts the latest processor used to give you. 
 Am I missing something about faster processors these days? I'm curious as to why it's such an important feature, if not the key feature for so many of you?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[天翼云电脑，之前在卡商贩子那里搞了一个 10 快钱一个月的优惠套餐，配置是 4c8G 的标准版，s （刚刚发现 v 友都是装宽带送的高级版本 8h16G 的，莫名感到血妈亏）但是吧关闭客户端之后一个小时会关机。
​	很早之前就有 v 友发帖，不休眠教程，当时感觉没啥用，最近迷上了一个微信小程序的小游戏，然后想着正好用云电脑挂机，顺便把 E5 签到的那个 window 程序也挂上去。
​	在此之前我还装了宝塔，奈何我的小鸡鸡做 frp 延迟不太友好，最后卸载了，大概原理就是，在云电脑上下载个客户端自己链接着自己，这里我就有个疑问了，帖子里用到了增倍器，既然是自己链接自己，那他链接之后直接吧我电脑上的客户端顶掉然后自己就一直在线呗，为什么还要增杯器来定时 55 分钟来执行一下这个软件呢？总不能超过 1h 之后他自己会断开连接吧。
​	然后我给电脑上能卸载的软件都卸载了，卸载完重启之后发现网络磁盘映射没了，共享剪切板也没了，然后微信打开小程序 cpu 占用直接 100%，反而内存是没有吃满的，so ，各位有天翼云电脑的，最好别卸载他自带的那些软件，而且他们说虽然这个网络是限速 50↑5 下，但是用他自带的软件的时候是没有限速的，最近还出了个什么 ai 市场，我也没试，就全卸载了。然后实际上本地挂天翼云自己链自己还要占用一部分资源，本来直接远程链接小程序游戏就卡的要死，不知道最后后那个游戏 G 了没，因为我看不出来挂机有多少收益。
ps:
​	刚刚用 ai 写了一个监控脚本。定时十秒一次，监控我在云主机上登录客户端顶号下去这个过程 cpu 的占用变化
​	emmm ，结果就是：
2024-08-26 22:17:33 - CPU Usage: 1.75% Memory Usage: 23.27%
2024-08-26 22:17:48 - CPU Usage: 65% Memory Usage: 31.15%
2024-08-26 22:18:02 - CPU Usage: 8.5% Memory Usage: 30.69%
2024-08-26 22:18:16 - CPU Usage: 9.5% Memory Usage: 30.88%

​	只有那自己连自己那一瞬间会 cpu 高升一下，但是呢，我还是好奇那个增倍器的作用，教程里都是设置 50 分钟执行左右一次，50 分钟左右肯定还没到 60 分钟关机的时候，既然这样我直接设置成 5 分钟之后运行一次，然后再看监控 cpu 占用，竟然没有什么变化。
​	看来自己连自己会增加占用倒是不太可能，但是把我挂上我的微信和微信小程序的游戏之后：
2024-08-26 22:09:00 - CPU Usage: 82.5% Memory Usage: 41.7%
2024-08-26 22:09:15 - CPU Usage: 98.25% Memory Usage: 39.82%
2024-08-26 22:09:30 - CPU Usage: 94% Memory Usage: 39.64%
2024-08-26 22:09:45 - CPU Usage: 100% Memory Usage: 42%
2024-08-26 22:10:00 - CPU Usage: 100% Memory Usage: 43.66%

​	主要是这个直接登录微信，然后开那个小程序都占用百分之七八十
​	所以问题回来了，我用的时候就连上用，然后不用需要挂机的时候就在云电脑上面开启客户端直接把本地这个顶掉不就完事了，所以增倍器的作用是什么呢？
​	所以我单独试了一次不开增倍器，然后等一个小时的实验，电脑上挂我微信，然后我在 22 点 52 分的时候给自己顶掉
​	然后等 12 点的时候手机看看我微信 pc 掉线没就可以了
顺便问一嘴，有啥可以嫖这些东西的路子嘛，我感觉我这个 cpu 强度再上来点，可以挂机游戏了，但是。。哎]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[阿里云之前也开源过一个 grafana datasource 插件，不过太老了，这两年完全没有更新。升级到最新版的 grafana 提示说插件是用 angular 写的,就要不支持了。
于是参考 grafana 自己的插件 examples 做了一个自己觉得用着顺手的 aliyun-grafana-datasource
功能特点
现代技术栈：基于最新的 Grafana 插件开发框架，与最新版本的 Grafana 的完美兼容
简易配置：参考了之前的插件,不过对监控组的支持更好
稳定可靠：之前的老插件每次配置都要调用各种接口获取配置列表，用 goroutine+缓存保证了每次只取一次,减少接口调用次数
使用场景
阿里云资源监控：实时监控 LB 、ECS 、RDS 等阿里云服务的关键指标，并在 Grafana 中进行可视化分析。
运维与报警：结合 Grafana 的报警功能，及时发现和响应阿里云资源的异常情况。
关于恰饭
放在 github 上的版本没做名称显示，我看之前的插件里还有不少 issue 求显示资源名的，所以做个付费试试水。也欢迎大家加群一起交流碰到的线上问题。如果做的东西能帮各位快速定位一两个问题让大家早点儿下班就圆满啦~]]></summary>

正如每起诈骗案件一样，租赁方某天随着店铺迁移消失了，联系方式仅有微信好友。目前尝试过以下方案：
警方 称电动车在我手里，对方行为属于合同违约，需要到法院起诉，警方无法立案；
市民热线 称无法处理非消费者投诉；
法院起诉 后对方不参与开庭，无果；
维权群 中其他受害者大多持有吃瘪心态，不愿继续掺和此事。
目前已经联系京东恢复了购买订单，但似乎无济于事。请问在这种情况下还有什么法律渠道可以寻求帮助？

aspeed 的 vga or GTX1080TI 的 hdmi ）
现在一旦用一个显示器开机之后，再切换显示器就无输出，除非重启
想问下有啥好办法没]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you have a computer which has ever run Windows to install the August cummulative update (fixing CVE-20220-2601), and at the time of the update, if Microsoft decides that you don't need Linux on this computer (e.g. if you always boot Linux with a Live CD, or if it fails to detect a dual-boot), then it alters the SBAT policy of the motherboard so that the next time when you attempt to boot Linux with an out-dated shim image, it fails with the error:
 Verifying shim SBAT data failed: Security Policy Violation. Something has gone seriously wrong: SBAT self-check failed: Security Policy Violation 
 Then the computer automatically powers off.
 Resetting the secure boot to factory keys in UEFI BIOS won't help. Microsoft has published a document on how to temporarily fix secure boot for Linux here.
 Linux installations and Live CDs will require a newer version of shim to be able to boot on motherboards patched by Microsoft.

 Linux has made amazing steps towards gaming. But I don’t see the same progress in enterprise applications. Just an example, so many companies rely on Microsoft apps, but for example Teams, onedrive etc. seem to not have “workarounds” to work under Linux and not some easy integration. Obviously the “fault” is mostly on companies like MS.
 Again this is a personal feeling, and let me know if I get it wrong. Do you also see this discrepancy in progress? Probably with the increase in userbase improvement on the availability of such applications will come?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Telegram 创始人在法国机场被拘留，事实上电报并不是目前市场上最安全的聊天软件，这里推荐几款比电报安全 100 倍的开源端对端加密开源聊天软件。
什么是端到端加密？
端到端加密(E2EE) 是一种消息传递类型，它使消息对所有人保持私密，包括消息传递服务。 使用 E2EE 时，消息仅在发送消息的人和接收消息的人面前以解密形式出现。 发送者是对话的一个“端”，而接收者是另一个“端”；因此得名“端到端”。
例如 a 和 b 通过中间服务器 s 端对端加密聊天，a 发出加密消息到服务器 s ，然后服务器 s 把消息给 b ，b 将消息解密，服务器 s 是无法看到消息内容的，确保没有第三方可以知道聊天内容。
Session
Session 是澳大利亚的一款端对端加密的开源即时通讯软件，是一款免费的消息应用程序，是 Oxen 计划的一部分。与其他端对端加密的聊天软件相比，其特点是不需要提供手机号码或者电子邮件即可注册。这一点可以保护您的元数据、加密通信并确保您的消息活动不会留下任何痕迹。
Session 注册的时候生成一个私钥，然后生成一个 id ，不需要手机号这样的隐私信息，添加好友也只需要 Session 生成的一个 id ，没有任何个人信息。Session 的点对点聊天也是端对端加密，而且没有服务端，聊天是通过 3 个去中心化节点进行中转，你的 ip 信息也不被泄露，你的元数据完全不被泄露。另外 Session 还支持阅后即焚，禁止截屏，阅读记录等，进一步提高安全性。
Session 可以在个人聊天和群聊中发送照片、视频和音频，但是速度有一点慢。
Session 的缺点是聊天速度略慢，公开群不支持端对端加密，不过既然是公开群了，加密也没有必要。
支持平台：安卓、ios 、mac 、window 、Linux

这个服务用了缓存，同一个网站只会爬一次，再次请求会直接读缓存，所以获取速度非常快，没有获取过的网站，第一次可能慢一点点，但是我研究了几乎所有 favicon 的写法成功率相当的高
并且部署在香港服务器，国内外网站均可获取也都可以调用
免费开放，大家用到的话比如做导航可以直接拼接获取，省去了自己去扒图标的麻烦
大家一起用图标库才能建立起来，后续会把图标库开放出来，并且针对常用网站做优化，把缓存替换成高清大图，这样就是一个可持续的 favicon 服务了

开发进度被严重阻碍，时也命也。
Ship-A-Ton 第二周
这周投入这个 App 的时间很少，吃喝玩乐+直面天命占了不少时间，但是不管怎样，还是在推进。和上一周相比，这周的工作时间大幅减少，只完成了 22 个番茄钟，还不如上周的一半多。

这周一开始花了一些时间在解决 TabView 和 NavigationStack 之间的问题上，本来是想尝试实现一个自定义的 TabBar ，最终放弃了这个尝试，因为根据上周的教训，不能花太多时间在 UI 上，先专注于功能的实现。
Stash 和 Nibble 的功能基本都完成了，Jar 目前只实现了两种类型，还剩几种存款类型没做。为了能够 ship ，或许应该先砍掉一些 Jar 的类型。
愿望清单模块又更名了，一开始叫 Wishlist ，后来叫 Goals ，现在改成了 Desires 。
想想还剩四周了，而还有很多功能，比如通知提醒、数据统计和小组件还都没有做，感觉有点来不及了。
好消息是，这周接触了一个设计师，已经达成了合作，接下来的四个星期要超级超级肝了！
第二个英文 Vlog
这周几乎没有录什么素材，为了撑视频的时长，加入了目前 App 的阶段性演示视频。
这次我没有自己录音，倒不是怕口音丢人，而是一方面是为了节省时间，另一方面是为了保证音频的音量统一并且没有背景杂音。我用的是剪映的 AI 朗读，先是克隆了我自己的声音，然后把文本通过克隆声音生成对应的朗读音频。这个声音克隆真是厉害，音色没得说，和我一模一样，但是缺点也很明显，就是没有语气的变化，整个停下来感觉非常沉闷。
Week 2 for Ship-A-Ton
本周学习
# How to use programmatic navigation in SwiftUI
# Sharing @Observable objects through SwiftUI's environment
# 在 SwiftData 模型中使用 Codable 和枚举的注意事项
# ContentUnavailableView: Handling Empty States in SwiftUI
直面天命
先说一下进度，目前刚过第三回的苦海。
周一早上起来，就知道瑞幸开卖周边了，于是立刻下单了外卖，成功抢到周边海报。

目前打得最多的就是白衣秀士、疯虎，被虐了二十多次才过。至于大家都惧怕的虎先锋，我打了四次就过了，比较辛运。目前卡在了寅虎，还在不断精进中。
这个游戏是我玩得第一个魂 like 游戏。我知道自己手残，之前玩过卧龙·苍天陨落，第一个 BOSS 都没打过去就删了，所以只狼和老头环一直没敢碰。这次黑神话能玩到现在，全靠我玩战神打下的一点基础。这个游戏就是磨练心性，越挫越勇，不断精进，提升自己。
玩了四天，手柄左摇杆就漂移了，虽然还在保修内，但是客服说需要返场维修，需要 7 到 14 天才能寄回来。本来想着要不就忍忍，这段时间正好用来写代码。但是纠结了一天，一想到要一个多星期不能直面天命，就痛苦不已，最终还是下单了新的手柄，次日达，继续直面天命！]]></summary>

If I were to start a LUG, what would be some good ways to promote it and make it seem valuable to my local community and worth attending?

Please tell me why this is a factor in favoring Gnome or another distro.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I wasn't able to find a fix for this anywhere, but I combined a few suggestions for other Asus laptops from a few different forums and found a combination that works for me, so I wanted to post it somewhere.
 First install alsa-tools
 Ubuntu/Debian/Pop_OS:
 sudo apt install alsa-tools
 Fedora/Nobara:
 sudo dnf install alsa-tools
 Then run this:
 sudo hda-verb /dev/snd/hwC0D0 0x20 0x500 0x1b
 sudo hda-verb /dev/snd/hwC0D0 0x20 0x477 0x4a4b
 sudo hda-verb /dev/snd/hwC0D0 0x20 0x500 0xf
 sudo hda-verb /dev/snd/hwC0D0 0x20 0x477 0x74
 sudo hda-verb /dev/snd/hwC0D0 0x20 0x500 0x0f
 sudo hda-verb /dev/snd/hwC0D0 0x20 0x400 0x7778
 sudo hda-verb /dev/snd/hwC0D0 0x20 0x500 0x40
 sudo hda-verb /dev/snd/hwC0D0 0x20 0x400 0x0800
 The speakers should start working immediately until you log out. I've tested this on both Ubuntu and Fedora.

回家能够无缝切换网关，比如 infuse 配置好了 emby 服务，从外面回到家中，流量可以自动从公网 IP 访问变成局域网 IP 直连。
不走服务器转发，希望能跑满带宽。
我目前的设备：
x86 软路由（ openwrt ）
qnap nas
目前我想了几个方案：
DDNS 方案 + 端口转发 + 内网 dns 映射（实现无缝切换）：直接 pass ，死的最快
DDNS + VPN （ openvpn ，wireguard 等）
DDNS + 加密代理服务（ ssr/v2ray 等） + 内网 dns 映射
内网穿透（ zerotier ）
4 由于需要自建服务器提升稳定性，只作为备用方案；
2 和 4 有一个共同的也是我最纠结的问题：会和魔法软件冲突，访问内网和魔法上网无法同时进行（宽带上行太慢，不考虑用软路由作为魔法网关）。
所以目前我觉得 3 是最理想的方案，但是还是对安全性有所担忧（主要是合规方面）：
2 和 3 都使用了 DDNS ，并且暴露了 VPN/ 代理服务 端口，这个行为是否会被认定为开设 web 服务
加密代理服务是否存在风险]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[突然想到,邮件可以说是最成熟最完美的去中心通信系统
邮件服务器是去中心,多实例的,全球有茫茫多的邮件服务器,而且你也随时可以搭建自己的邮件服务器接入邮件网络
邮件系统的技术也非常成熟,对话,附件,富文本,探活,协议开源等
邮件系统还非常安全可靠,不太可能有哪个国家把邮件系统封了
那么,听起来,基于邮件系统:
1v1 聊天,群聊,在线状态判断,离线消息暂存等功能都是现成的
理论上基于邮件系统搭建 IM 是个水到渠成且非常安全的模式
那么问题来了,有没有基于邮件的 IM 软件,以及为啥没流行起来呢?]]></summary>

Nissan - Windows: Quite cheaply made with tons of cut corners and lack of polish, glaring flaws (CVT, horrible forced software updates) that eventually lead to them breaking/slowing down after a few years, also I remember reading that newer Nissans came with the most spyware (like Windows for OSes) and modern-day cars in general are already notorious for containing copious amounts of spying.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[大家好，我老婆之前在大厂工作，985 毕业生。辞职一年后，她决定创业，开了一家轻食店。从租毛坯房到亲手设计、装修、筹备开业，每一步都投入了大量心血。我们对这家店充满期待，可谁知刚营业一周，老婆感觉身体不适，去医院一查，发现怀孕了。医生建议她静养，不能再继续忙碌店里的事了。
我日常也有自己的工作要做，无法代替她继续经营店铺。前期我们已经投入了几万块装修费，每个月还得支付几千元房租。现在店铺无法正常营业，面对这些支出，我确实有些迷茫。
想请教大家，有没有过类似经验？这种情况下应该怎么办？是考虑转让店铺，还是有其他更好的方式走出这个困境？非常感谢大家的宝贵意见！]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[之前一直觉得 x86 费电，arm 省电，实际测试发现没差多少。用了很久 arm 单口旁路由，现在换到 j4105 单口旁路由，带来的好处:
1. PVE 开 OP 操作很方便，web 界面省心。
2. 不用找专用于某个硬件的系统，x86 系统比较通用。ARM 刷机略微麻烦。
3. arm 便宜板子大多数有硬件的一些问题，比如 panther x2 没有 hdmi, usb 电压不足只有 4.6v 。x86 4 个高速 usb3.0 口，1 个 typec 口，舒服多了。
4. x86 的 openwrt 界面响应速度比 arm 的好，点击同一个软件，x86 几乎秒开，ARM 需要转几圈，可能跟硬盘之类的有关。
之前一直用 ARM 的旁路由，给别人推荐也是 ARM 的，感觉推荐错了，x86 才是最终选择。并且 ARM 也不一定省电，测试了一下运行功耗
panther x2(RK3566): 待机 1W ，跑满忘了是 5w 还是 10w
j4105 小主机:    待机 4w, 跑满 12W
我家云(RK3328): 待机 3-5W, 开机时最高达到 7W, 没加硬盘。
king3399(RK3399): 待机 2W]]></summary>

_weak void HAL_UART_AbortReceiveCpltCallback(UART_HandleTypeDef *huart)

如果我只想定义些简单的函数，用户可以在自己喜欢的地方重写它，go 中怎么实现类似的功能，或者 go 中有更好的实现？]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[今天听组里的同事说，在程序当中如果是单表插入不需要开启事务，如果插入不进去肯定失败，我很好奇如果不开启事务 mysql 会怎么处理？我怀疑如下:
1.如果程序当中不开启事务 mysql 会不会使用默认事务？
2.如果不开启事务 mysql 是怎么保证数据持久化的还是说对于 ddl 语句 mysql 会隐式提交？
3.如果不开启事务在主从同步下，mysql 怎么同步 binlog 日志？
对于如上问题我做了个实验，如果 mysql 不开启事务进行单表插入且在主从同步下，因为没有提交事务，redo 一直处于 prepare 状态，本次事务一直等待，如果 mysql 存在隐式提交那么它会把那些未提交的事务一并提交，这点可以从 binlog 日志看出来，如果没有隐式提交,此时 mysql 挂掉那么没有提交的事务就丢了，实验结果也是如此。
请问如果是单表操作，要不要开启事务呢？]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[前一段时间，有一个小红书的博主，向大家展示自己向 Kubernetes 提交一行文档错误修复的 PR ，并获得批准的过程。那时候，不少人指责博主这么做是在浪费开源软件维护者的时间。
值得一提的是，有一种观点认为，提交这一类 PR 的人，并不是真心愿意参与开源项目，只是期盼未来出现形如 HNS 或者 STRK 这样的加密货币空投，发放给在开源社区有过贡献的人，从而让自己也获取数百美元的空投加密货币，带来经济利益。
在过去，即便提交的 PR 很细小，维护者也会为了鼓励这些人再次来参与贡献，从而走完正常的 PR 审批流程，最终让这些 PR 获得通过。
如果有加密货币空投这个因素需要考虑的话，那么作为具有一定数量的 star 的开源软件维护者，是否需要在 PR 审核的策略上，做出一些调整，把这些并非真正参与开源项目，而是博取针对开源贡献者的加密货币空投的人，来过滤掉？但是这也没有一个有效的策略，可能需要对这个人以及这个 GitHub 账号进行深入的背景调查，才能得出这个人对这个开源项目的忠诚程度。]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[魔兽世界国服回归后，新版本《地心之战》即将登场，网易推增值服务“网易DD”提供带打服务，疑似官方下场参与RMT（Real Money Trading，即现实货币交易）事件，在玩家社区中引起了广泛的关注和讨论。


事件概述


网易有爱是网易官方推出的一个魔兽世界插件整合包，类似魔兽世界大脚插件或CurseForge，在国服重开之后，“网易有爱”更名为“网易DD”，并且重做了客户端，加入了更多的板块，8月22日，网易DD首页推出了一项增值服务，是以抢卷的方式为玩家提供H菲莱克地带打服务，原来30元的价格，降到0.01元，相当于用一分钱就让玩家体验其他工作室带打服务。另外，客服会强调这是官方团队，并且把这次的H菲莱克形容为“公益团”的带打行为。


对此，玩家对此反应强烈，认为官方下场RMT破坏了游戏的平衡性和公平性，直接触及了游戏公平性和玩家体验的底线，使得游戏环境变得更加恶劣。同时，这也引发了玩家对网易运营能力和游戏未来的担忧。


官方回应


8月22日，网易运营团队在国服《魔兽世界》官网发布公告表示，此前引发大量玩家讨论的网易 DD“找人带带”活动已经下线。公告原文如下：



亲爱的玩家：


今日，网易《魔兽世界》官方运营团队收到玩家社区反馈，网易互联网新产品“网易DD”上线了暑期活动“找人带带”，并引发大量玩家讨论。我们第一时间与网易 DD 的同事们展开沟通，经协商，目前该活动已经下线。


网易DD是网易集团旗下独立运营的工具软件，目前处于内测阶段，其运营行为具备自主性。在本次活动开展前，集团内部缺少及时的同步沟通，因此对社区造成了困扰，我们深感抱歉。


未来我们将强化对各类工具软件的合作沟通机制及监督流程，始终把游戏的长期健康发展和服务广大玩家需求作为唯一目标，杜绝再次出现此类导致游戏社区困扰的活动。



对游戏生态的影响


根据国服暴雪战网最终用户许可协议1.C.iii.条款，战网用户同意不利用平台或游戏作为任何未被本协议授权的商业用途，包括以代练、租借通行证或游戏账号等形式进行游戏相关的服务以换取酬劳。


RMT行为在网络游戏中有着复杂且深远的影响，以下是一些主要的方面：


游戏公平性受损：RMT行为的存在使得玩家可以通过现实货币直接购买游戏内的优势资源或服务，从而破坏了游戏的公平竞争原则。


玩家体验下降：对于坚持通过自身努力提升游戏水平的玩家来说，RMT行为无疑是一种打击。他们可能会因为无法与RMB玩家竞争而感到沮丧和失望。这可能导致非付费玩家失去游戏兴趣，影响游戏的用户基数和社区健康。


破坏经济系统：RMT行为会破坏游戏内的经济平衡，一些玩家通过购买强力装备或虚拟货币获取优势，而不需要花费相应的时间和精力。这会导致游戏内的竞争失衡，可能让那些靠努力获取资源的玩家感到不公。


深层原因


虽然RMT行为在某些方面可能为工作室公司带来短期经济收益，但从长远看，游戏工作室对一款网络游戏的生命具有极大的破坏力，工作室会破坏游戏的平衡性和公平性，导致玩家流失，会大大缩减游戏的寿命，影响游戏的整体健康发展。游戏的开发商和运营商通常会采取有效的措施来限制工作室的活动，以确保游戏的可持续发展。


既然如此，为什么网易为什么还要官方下场参与RMT行为呢？这和目前的市场环境有很大关系。


目前的经济政策在一定程度上影响了企业的行为模式，导致一些企业倾向于追求短期利益，喜欢赚快钱，不肯投太多钱搞研发，喜欢偷别人的技术。


经济政策朝令夕改，具有极大的不确定性，这种不确定性使得企业难以进行长期规划，因为未来的政策可能会突然改变市场环境，导致企业前期投资大量损失，为了应对这种不确定性，企业可能更倾向于短期快速获利，赚快钱，而不是进行长期投资，忽视了长期的品牌建设和可持续发展。


网易做为一家庞大的游戏企业，也喜欢赚快钱。由于长时间的政策性风险，能够存活下来的网易，在结构性上就只有运营赚快钱游戏的经验，给它一个需要长期运营的游戏，它根本就不知道怎么才能有效运营，它从根本上还是打算执行运营一个只能存活1、2年的游戏的策略，只倾向于追求短期利益，而从不考虑长远发展，这就是网易为什么要做出这种让玩家匪夷所思行为的深层原因。


结语


综上所述，网易《魔兽世界》疑似官方下场RMT事件对游戏生态和玩家体验造成了严重影响，网易应该及时悬崖勒马，亡羊补牢，采取积极措施来应对此事件，确保游戏环境的公平性和健康性，同时也应加强与玩家之间的沟通和交流，共同推动游戏的持续健康发展。]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Was tired of the fans on my loud Razer laptop from 2017 spinning up while doing nothing because windows, and installed debian with i3wm. My second time ever trying linux(last time probably 15 years ago, and I gave up). 
 It has been completely revolutionary. Finally I can have a almost 90% keyboardbased workflow, not having to deal with terrible laptop touchpads. 
 It did take me almost 3 full working days and 2 reinstalls to get it up and running in a proper way. Been fighting with wifi drivers, fixing suspend for closing the lid etc. But it’s finally up and running. Batterytime doubled, runs cool and no fans suddenly spinning for no apparent reason. ChatGPT has been the biggest savior for getting it set up. It spews a lot of garbage and confidently tells you wrong instructions, but for basic setup it seems to hit the mark with a far higher accuracy than browsing rude forum posts from 2009. 
 Debian w/ i3 is obviously still terrible at being user friendly, and almost everything is a hassle the first couple of times, but at least you feel respected as a user.

 Brave is also open-source, and people nowadays are already used to chromium (many not liking gecko).
 Brave also come with a adblock as default (while in firefox you need to install manually), which would make people prefer it even more.

I think I understood it is a "special distribution for developers" but I'm not sure. I see some videos from his YT Channel doing some driver and interesting things, but still I have not idea what it is exactly that project .
 I read from some place , that is a "hardcore Linux Distribution" but still I do not found the main idea. Thank you guys. You can see his project here : https://t2sde.org/

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello HN!
My name is Patrick, and I am a junior at my High School’s FRC robotics team FRC 341 “Miss Daisy” (yes named after the movie). Every year, during the first weekend in January, a new robotics game is released (no it’s not battlebots). The game could be about launching balls into a goal, climbing monkeybars, or placing cubes on a see-saw. This year we were challenged to build a robot that could shoot orange foam donuts into a goal about 6 feet in the air. Here is a yt video with the game animation https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9keeDyFxzY4&t. After we received the game we then had six weeks to design, build, program, and field a robot capable of playing the game. And we did pretty well this year! I have attached a ChiefDelphi thread (robotics forum) where we have released our season materials. This being our CAD (3D model of robot), code, and design binder. I encourage you to take a look and leave any questions that you may have.
Thanks a lot!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[家庭本来挺好的，有一个可爱的女儿，有车有房无贷款，小康家庭。
目前跟老婆面临的问题是：
一，我想要二胎，她不愿意。原因是因为她怀孕孕吐很厉害，还很害怕生孩子。（双方父母都支持，她的 2 个兄弟都生了 2-3 个孩子）
二，她抗拒夫妻生活，已经有 4 个月不让我碰她了。去年也差不多这样，原因就是工作累，没有这方面的需求，同房就能联想到生孩子，心理抗拒。（谈恋爱的时候也都很正常很合拍，刚结婚也正常，转折点就是生孩子）
先声明几点：
双方都没有移情别恋，在同一家公司上班，几乎 24 小时都能看到对方。我们一起努力搞好工作，搞好家庭，搞好孩子的成长，平时几乎不吵架甚至都不拌嘴，简直是完美的那种。
之前她自己怀疑是心理问题，还约了心理医生聊，也是没效果。
我不想分开，也不打算找婚外恋，或者找小姐，破坏家庭之类的，就是想解决问题。
前两天看到帖子，大家普遍婚后依然每周 2-3 次，我很震惊，我以为大部分的人有小孩后都是一个月 1 次之类的。联想到自己，不禁悲从中来。
今天晚上找她认真聊这两件事情，聊着聊着不知不觉就吵架了，我努力控制情绪不做出任何失控的事情，我本想把这 2 个问题发到家里群了（群里有她父母和兄弟），后来想想公开以后怕影响都不好，以后见面都会尴尬。目前想着是单独找我丈母娘聊一下（她暑假来我们这边了），看看能不能让她帮我劝劝老婆。
事情就是这样的，我面临的问题，有什么办法可以解决的吗？请 v 友们帮忙出出主意]]></summary>

老家长辈的电视坏了，表现为：开机启动到现实海信 logo 处，自动重启，反复循环只能走到 logo 这里，进不去系统。
进展
已过保；
联系售后上门，售后说法为：led 灯条损坏，更换费用 550 ；
有疑惑，不太信任对方的说法，所以没同意维修；
疑惑
led 灯条坏，不应该是屏幕非常暗的接近黑屏么，为什么能看到 logo ，却说 led 灯条坏？
灯条坏了，还影响进系统么？
灯条我搜了下材料 50 块以内，等于换一下的人工费就要 500 ，现在维修家电这么贵的么？
求助
自己在网上搜了一下，类似情况的有刷机恢复的、有更换 emmc 或主板芯片的，想请懂的朋友补充补充，还有其他什么可能？目前打算中秋回去刷机试一下，然后再看看第三方维修的什么价格，以及 v 友指点的我有能力试试的；
多年前全新才 1200+，这修一下 550 ，还指不定其他方面有没有计划报废的情况，最后不合适修的话，是不是还不如卖掉给长辈重新买个新的在保的了？]]></summary>

近期因为架构调整，做 java 业务开发，业务水平自我感觉熟悉业务后大概是 2 年左右的 javaer ，主要劣势在于之前没做过业务，对于业务场景熟练度不行，很多业务封装也不太会，所以感觉自己开发速度慢。在这段 java 开发的时间里也发现自己的一些优点，比如容易看到一些可以合理优化的地方，一些风险性的地方，以及对于遇到的系统性问题定位很准确。
最近就比较迷茫于未来几年路线如何规划：
一方面自己很喜欢做开发，做运维期间觉得运维很被动，即便是做了很多自动化的工作，大多时候依然是觉得在自嗨，对于公司和领导来说并没有实际意义上的产出。但是开发能力肯定比不过同期的开发同事，如果继续走开发路线，预估还要好几年沉淀才能追赶起来。
另一方面又觉得如果自己继续走运维/SRE/DEVOPS 路线，肯定是特别的有优势，未来的运维岗位逐渐减少，大的趋势是往会开发的运维发展。
如果是你们遇到这样的场景，会怎么规划发展规划？]]></summary>

## Processing build commands from <fdopen>
Line 1: Failed to parse build command [Details: (<class 'bashlex.tokenizer.MatchedPairError'>) unexpected EOF while looking for matching '`' (position 78)]. Ignoring: 'make: Entering directory `/c/sw_package/sources/iot/hello/src''
New command: C:\tools\MinGW\bin\gcc.exe -IC:\tools\MinGW\i686-w64-mingw32\include hello.c -v --debug -o hello.exe
Line 3: Failed to parse build command [Details: (<class 'bashlex.tokenizer.MatchedPairError'>) unexpected EOF while looking for matching '`' (position 77)]. Ignoring: 'make: Leaving directory `/c/sw_package/sources/iot/hello/src''
## Loaded compilation database with 0 entries from compile_commands.json
## Writing compilation database with 0 entries to compile_commands.json
## Done.

很明显，compiledb 因为这个路径两边的字符不一样而报错了。进而导致生成的compile_commands.json是一个空文件。
我又单独执行了 make ，发现确实是这样的，就是 make 时，出现 make: Entering directory 时，那个路径的两边字符就是不一样的，分别是反引号和单引号。
make: Entering directory `/c/sw_package/sources/iot/hello/src'

请问各位大佬，这是 make 的问题吗？
还是说，make 的输出就是对的没有问题，但是我得自己 特殊处理一下 make 的输出，再给到 compiledb ？]]></summary>

其中的解包核心代码
//如果消息体超过 4096(默认长度)
var pack []byte
if length > 4096 {
pack = make([]byte, 0, int(length-1))
readableLength := length - 1

pack = append(pack, slice...)
//更新可读长度
readableLength = readableLength - int32(len(slice))
}
// buffer 返回缓冲中现有的可读的字节数，2+length+1 表示帧类型+数据长度+帧尾
} else if length < 4096 && int32(reader.Buffered()) < length-1 {

由于本人发送的消息体达到 2w ，进入第一个循环，打印出 len(slice)，除了第一次有数据，后面 slice 长度全是 0 ，后面这个 pack 一直循环中，读取不到更多数据
求解？数据哪里去了，怎样能取出？]]></summary>

aqara a100pro
手机分别是：
我	ip13pm
老爸	ip14
老妈	ip11
我的家庭 app 包含：
HomePod
我家网络：
联通
爸妈家网络：
联通
HomePod 在我家，
门锁是装在爸妈家，设定的时候，
我选择绑定到我的手机家庭 app 里面，
虽然 HomePod 在我家，门锁在我爸妈家，
NFC 钥匙都可以正常使用（家庭中枢原来不需要在当地网络也可以呀）
后续我自己新买了一个门锁，然后就想着两地也有点儿距离，
还不如新创建一个家庭。方便管理，于是
就把 HomePod 从原来的家庭，转移到了新家庭。
这样原来爸妈所在的那个家庭就没有了家庭中枢，
我的钱包 app 里面的 NFC 钥匙还可以正常刷进门，
爸妈的 NFC 钥匙完全失灵，表现就是手机刷卡速度很慢，
还有时候开门失败。
但手机屏幕显示 NFC 钥匙也可以跳出来，
并且有时候状态也能显示 [完成] ，
但是门锁就是安静如鸡，没有开门动作。
我重置了好几次，重新绑定到那个有 HomePod 的新家庭，
也不行，分享给他们的钥匙全部同样症状。
联系了 aqara ，他们也没遇到过这种情况。
一怒之下，骑上电动车跑去店里面买了一个 HomePod mini ，
装在爸妈家，门锁恢复出厂设置，
用我老豆的手机一步步激活 HomePod 和门锁，
添加到家庭，NFC 钥匙正常使用，
分享给我和我妈，都正常使用。
我始终想不通，我门锁都已经全部重置，
添加到有 HomePod 的家庭，为何分享的钥匙还是失灵？
我到底哪一步没有做对？]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi there,
 I have been lately trying out different launchers and I wonder which one is the best in your opinion and why?
 I was looking for a customizable and as lightweight as possible Launcher.
 There are some minimalist launchers but they lack for example widgets that you can use for Smart Home or some quick info.
 If the Launcher allows for widgets, it then feels little slow and somewhat bloated as they tend to add a ton of "effects" instead making it snappy and most of the time there are huge gaps between the widgets and icons which isn't efficient.
 As I'm looking for a launcher if you have a favorite one you use now, please let me know :)

 I have been using Hyprland for a while. And, I always hated the screen share here. Even after changing Ozone platform to Wayland in chromium, it crashes after a while. Screen share on Firefox also doesn't work.
 So today, I had to share my screen for work. I just installed i3 and I thought to myself, why not try it in TTY.
 So long story short, I was using Hyprland on TTY1 and then on another TTY, I launched i3 and shared the screen.
 The experience was so smooth. And, I was surprised that I could use multiple window managers without logging out and switching to other. I could just switch between TTYs to use different window managers / compositor.
 I would like to know if there are any problems that could occur from this.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[为了解决 HuggingFace 在访问上的困难，以及本地多台服务器重复下载同一个仓库的加速问题。
如何在本地自建 HuggingFace 镜像一直是头疼的问题。
Olah应运而生。
Olah 是开源的自托管轻量级 HuggingFace 镜像服务。相较于 hf-mirror ，Olah 真正地实现了 huggingface 资源的镜像功能，而不仅仅是一个简单的反向代理。Olah 并不会立刻对 huggingface 全站进行镜像，而是在用户下载的同时在文件块级别对资源进行镜像（或者我们可以说是缓存）。
Olah 能够在用户下载的同时分块缓存文件。当第二次下载时，直接从缓存中读取，极大地提升了下载速度并节约了流量。 同时 Olah 提供了丰富的缓存控制策略，管理员可以通过配置文件设置哪些仓库可以访问，哪些仓库可以缓存。
好了，目前就是项目的简单介绍，欢迎大家移步项目地址进行讨论

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[最近闲来无事，大概率今年都会闲了，所以最近在 0 编码基础的前提下，找课自学 python 。
学 python 的目的不是为了就业，而是想以后写点自己的 web 项目，给本地企业做做简单的官网，以及搞搞简单爬虫，自动化脚本之类的副业
一开始在 B 站看免费的，看了个把月吧，把黑马的 python 课 164 节看完了，也看了一些银角大王-武沛齐的课，还有一些其他的，感觉课程有些问题啊
1 、老师讲的太浅，很多地方只是一笔带过（比如同一个知识点，我看完 A 老师的课，有时在看 B 老师时，后者会说一些技巧，或者知识补充，我才意识到 A 没说全啊）
2 、课程主要讲知识点，也做一些实践，但是数量少，而且没有完整的项目
3 、而且还有，无关的话太多，磨蹭，画面不清晰，语音有问题，缺少课件，教材版本落后……（这部分归纳就是观感很难受）
总而言之，想着这样东看一节课，西看一节，要不干脆去买个系统的付费课看了？于是看到 MK 的一个课程 Python Web 全栈工程师。要价 2600 大洋。看着课表所教授的知识点似乎很符合我的学习目的。
https://class.imooc.com/presaleconsult/pythonweb#Anchor
大佬看看这个课程怎么样？有点想买，又怕浪费钱，特问下 V 友大佬给点意见，我想买黑马的，但官网没看到我想要的课程。（绝不是广告啊，最近发了几个 python 帖了）请原谅真人菜狗自学的窘迫]]></summary>

前天我左边的同时腿部感染，说是丹毒，肿胀的很厉害，请了两天假，但是严重了，可能还要请几天假，于是昨天周五开会，老板说进度被耽误了，让产品经理联系一下这位同事在家能不能办公，说他腿难受，应该不耽误用电脑。我当时内心觉得打工人真的是……，既然公司裁员这么猛，就要做好这种不可控的风险，人家请假了在家，而且还身体难受，还要给你在请假期间工作？无法理解，我只觉得完不成是风险管控和项目排期的不合理。
所以对待工作别太认真，有啥用呢？]]></summary>

Thats when I got introduced to this brand with the Redmi Note 9 Pro which I bought lightly used 2.5 years ago for 140$. I was shocked to see that what I did on my 1400$ iPhone actually felt easier on Android even on a cheap phone with low specs. There some huge gaps in terms of camera and snappiness of course but the experience was still a 7.5/10 which for the price difference blew my mind and in fact some features on Android were plain impossible on iOS (custom video players, access to useful open source apps etc.) My previous experience with Android was way back in the day were I bought a Samsung No…]]></summary>

I've been working sporadically over the last six months on a go monorepo tool (0 config it just use go workspace and go convention). It’s basically like TurboRepo but without the task runner. The tool builds a dependency graph between packages, allowing you to do things similar to what you can do in TurboRepo, like "only test the packages and the packages that depend on them, compared to the main branch," or "only install dependencies for Package A and its dependencies," etc. I use native go tool to get dependencies and create dependency graph between the package.Nothing crazy but I feel it could be useful.

当前是 N4200 工控主板 + iKuai + OP ，双 300M 宽带

折腾的目的主要是想玩玩 ROS ，目前拿家里破台式机当路由跑了两周，感觉还挺不错
目前纠结是直接咸鱼 RB5009 还是 N100 + P10 CHR ，这俩实际到手价格应该差不太多。RB5009 样子很喜欢，不过 CHR 后续可以转让 + N100 后面还可以挪作它用也很不错。
其实我还有个骚想法，NAS 换 12300T ，替换下来的 E31230 搞个 1U 工控机箱做路由。但是这个投入感觉有点儿高，正在极力克制中]]></summary>

        <id>https://www.v2ex.com/t/1067391#reply5</id>
        <link href="https://www.v2ex.com/t/1067391#reply5"/>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[根本原因是 Plex 这家公司在往流媒体转型，很多方面压根就不会考虑 self-hosted 用户的体验。Plex 的优点无非就是 UI 更好看，易上手，bug 相对少一些，而这些你用 Infuse 都可以获得更好的体验。但 Plex 的问题大部分很难甚至没法解决
1 、Plex 自带的播放器只支持 30 秒快进，而且是写死的。这个是在外网被说烂的 ticket ，但 Plex 官方没有任何要优化的意图，说白了就是自建用户的体验压根不重要。当然了你用 Infuse 这种第三方可以解决，但我都用 Infuse 了 Plex 跟 Jellyfin 有啥差别？
2 、Infuse 直连 Jellyfin 的体验远好于 Plex ，不管是速度还是稳定性。Jellyfin 还有官方插件可以直接支持动态增量更新，Plex 那就慢慢等吧
3 、Plex 对第三方插件的态度是没给你 ban 掉就感恩吧。这带来的后果之一就是 NFO 支持很烂，只能用五六年前的 XMBC 插件。对这当然能用，但你不能在界面里面修改 NFO ，也不确定以后会不会直接不给你用或者有什么兼容性问题。事实上最近若干年 Plex 基本就没有新的插件甚至是官方的插件文档出现，这是一个已经被废弃的功能。
4 、Plex 对刮削的支持越来越保守。现在默认只支持 Plex 自己搞的元数据库，手动改成 TMDB 或者 TVDB 会弹警告让你升级。并且明确告知未来会取消对 legacy 元数据库的支持
5 、Plex 只支持在线认证，这意味着你的家用服务器断开 Internet 在局域网也可能无法访问。
6 、Plex 的趋势是在主页塞越来越多的私货，目前大部分都可以关闭或者移除，但未来就不好说了。你如果看过 Plex 在 AppStore 上的介绍，就会发现这货宣传重点几乎全是流媒体，只有最后一张图提了一嘴我们还支持自建服务器哦。
Jellyfin 优点就不说了，关于缺点
1 、UI 很原始，但该有的功能都有，硬件转码配置也很方便，如果你用 Infuse 的话这应该不会是一个问题。iOS 和 ATV 上的 swiftfin 效果也还不错，但还有一些 bug ，社区更新也不算积极。
2 、命名不规范的情况下，刮削命中率比 Plex 差。如果有良好的命名习惯或者用 TMM 批量修正的话这个也不是啥大问题。另外 Jellyfin 的手动修正比 Plex 稳定很多，Plex 的新 Agent 特别坑爹，有时候搜不到东西你也不知道为啥，我上次在 Plex 搜了半天龙珠 Z 竟然死活搜不出来，就很离谱。Jellyfin 再不济你可以直接填 TMDB 和 TVDB 的 ID 手动匹配
3 、多主机、多用户支持没有 Plex 好。Plex 可以一个账户绑定多个主机然后统一管理，这个在 Jellyfin 这边没啥很方便的方案，不过我没这个需求就也还好。
4 、分享功能对小白不友好，要么走 tunnel 比如 tailscale 之类的，要么就要反代到公网。授权也只能通过本地建新账户，而不是直接向对方账号发邀请的方式
我的感受是现在已经不推荐购买 Plex 大会员了，尽管我之前买过 Plex 的终身会员。
新用户尤其是个人用户不需要分享给一大堆人的话，这钱够买七八年 Infuse 了，而且 Infuse 还能家庭组拼车，基本等于不要钱。]]></summary>

Here’s a quick demo video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bf-xTsDT5FQ. If you want to try it out directly, there are instructions below.
With Moonglow, you can start and stop pre-configured remote cloud machines within VSCode, and it makes those servers appear to VSCode like normal Jupyter kernels that you can connect your notebook to.
We built this because we learned from talking to data scientists and ML researchers that scaling up experiments is hard. Most researchers like to start in a Jupyter notebook, but they rapidly hit a wall when they need to scale up to more powerful compute resources. To do so, they need to spin up a remote machine and then a…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[前几天，去朋友工作的小公司溜达，朋友写前端，他身后一哥们写后端，看起来不到三十岁。我闲着无聊，就坐在后端老哥旁边，看他写写代码，不一会儿我朋友前端问题修改完了，打包项目发给他部署到服务器测试一下。这时候我看着后端开始了操作，他们用的是 Caddy Web Server ，于是后端就开始改 Caddyfile 文件：
:2333 {
   root * /var/www
   file_server
}

:2333 {
   root * /usr/root/dist
   file_server
}

他简单的把之前的复制了一下，改了root路径，就打算重启caddy了。我说：端口也要改吧？他说：先试试。于是重启caddy，发现报端口重复的错误，又再次编辑Caddyfile，把端口改了。那一瞬间我甚至怀疑他是不是第一次写代码了，我虽然没用过caddy，但一个端口配置两个网站，稍微想想也不可能有这种操作吧？
这件事让我想起几年前隔壁公司的一个女程序员 A ，因为大家一起下楼吃饭，也都比较熟，有一次 A 找我说：JS 有几个地方的代码报错，能不能帮她看看怎么回事？我过去一看，好家伙！一个类里面这样写着：
class Store {
    function getItem(key: string) {
        // TODO
    }
}

我说类里面写函数为什么要加 function 关键字？她说好像有这种语法吧，她试了不行还以为开发环境哪里出错了！
再说到另一个男同事 B ，这个同事是纯前端，完全不懂一点后端。有一次，他想试试用Node.js怎么读写数据库实现用户登录，然而编辑器却总是提示错误，我偶然瞅了一眼他正在摸索着写的代码，发现他在 JS 文件里这样写着：
import sqlite3 from 'sqlite3';

export function login(req: Request) {
    sqlite3.SELECT * FROM users
}

我震惊了！函数里面都不是JS语法，这都看不出来？
为什么我要说这几个事情呢，因为他们的情况真的太反差了。通过以上几个事情，不管是谁，第一印象都会觉得这几个人水平很菜。但除了第一个后端，后两个我是知道的。女程序员 A 和男同事 B 工作经历大概都是五六年了。
女程序员 A 在他们公司干了两年，做的项目大概一二十万代码，她每天提交代码，开发能力肯定是够的，后面跳槽去了其他公司，据说干得也很好。
男同事 B 参与的项目八十多万行代码（ css + js/jsx/ts/tsx + json ）,他参与需求开发和性能优化，平时的工作任务也没出过什么问题。
你说他们水平不够吧，他们靠自己的能力完全能够应付日常的开发工作。你说他们厉害吧，有时候写出来的代码我甚至都怀疑他们会不会编程。（上面的几个问题，他们不是大意而犯错，是真的不知道自己写错了）
真是奇哉怪哉！]]></summary>

    resolve();
  })
}

async1();
new Promise(function(resolve) {
  resolve();
}).then(function() {
  console.log('promise2');
})

输出结果为
promise2
async1 end

(面试时候遇到的，去掉了无关的 log)
想知道为什么 promise2 早于 async1 end ？
我的想法是 async2() 的 then 方法早于 new Promise 的 then 方法执行，那么其回调函数就应该先被放入微任务队列，也就应该先被执行，但实际情况不是这样。
另外，如果我把 async1 和 async2 的 async 关键字去掉，那么输出就变为
async1 end
promise2

求大佬解答]]></summary>

2 、关于托管平台，我看 vercel 和 cloudlfare 各有各的好，但是我看到过一种说法，说很多人都是用的 cloudflare 的 cdn ，再解析到 vercel 上，为啥要整这么复杂？
3 、关于独立站，很多分享都集中在前端和内容这部分，这些东西最后都是以静态页面的形式托管在平台上，关于流量分析、newsletter 订阅和用户注册/付费这些东西照理说也应该有一些后台功能，这部分一般是用什么做的？]]></summary>

各位大佬，上面的配置是买云服务器还是自己买刀片服务器托管合适呢
云服务器找了几家询价之后，3 年大概在 20 万左右；托管机房的话大概 4000 一个月，不算硬件硬件还没考虑]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[先说明发这个帖子的目的：各位帮我想想在哪些环节容易出现个人信息的泄露，以及如何在日后避免。
介绍
因为小区开门禁需要使用 APP 操作，但是我觉得过于繁琐，所以通过抓包获取了开门的 POST （非常简单的请求，附载只需要手机号和门禁 ID ，没有任何加密），并自己做了一个简单的 Android APP ，顺便学习一下 Android 开发。
行为
1. GitHub
该软件的代码已开源并托管在 Public GitHub Repo ，GitHub 账户绑定了我在香港的大学的教育邮箱
2. 我的主力机
港版 Nothing Phone (2)，安装的是 GitHub 上 release 版的 APP ，未主动安装过反诈 APP
3. 我的备用机
国行 Realme 12 Pro+，安装的是 Android Studio Debug 版的 APP ，未主动安装过反诈 APP
4. 我爸的手机
国行 Samsung S22 ，安装的是 GitHub 上 release 版的 APP ，曾经安装过反诈 APP ，但是据我爸说在安装我的软件前已经卸载反诈 APP
5. 我的主用电话卡
插在我的主力机上，但是卡是落于我爸名下，但是我不清楚是否依旧被标记使用人是我
6. 我的备用电话卡
插在我的备用机上，实名认证是我
7. 微信
我在微信视频号上发布了一个关于我这个软件的介绍视频，并转发到了朋友圈，我的微信账号绑定的是我的主用电话卡
细节
反诈电话只打给了我，打的是我的主用电话卡，没有打给我爸，上来正确直呼了我的名字以及我做的软件名字。电话时间大概是我这个 APP 安装在我两部手机上一周后，是安装在我爸手机上约 3 天后，是我发布微信视频约 5 天后。
最开始接到的是 96110 ，跟对方说明这个不是诈骗软件后，对方表示了解，并让我以后多注意一些。在挂断 96110 之后，街道公安打电话来了，表示要上访到家现场检查我的软件，但是因为我在学校，对方表示要把我这个情况反馈给上级，现无进一步通知。
疑问
为什么公安只打电话给我，并问我是不是我安装了这个软件，而从未询问过我爸？
反诈中心是怎么评判一个软件是否是诈骗软件的？
我在之前也做过很多小软件，不过都没有在我爸的手机上安装，为什么那些公安没有来查？
我已经尽可能详细的写出所有细节，希望各位帮我想想到底是哪里出了问题？我个人觉得是视频号（但是要是完整看过这个视频，都不至于会认为这是个诈骗软件，因为这个视频已经把我这个软件的所有功能都演示过了）。
我担心的不是反诈中心误杀了我这个软件，而是他们是怎么监测到我这个刚开发的软件的，在上述环节中总有一个地方被监测到了，我担心的是这个，并希望把这个隐藏的「威胁」清除。
如果这个帖子还泄露了什么个人信息，烦请管理员帮忙删了，学生一枚，真的已经害怕了😨]]></summary>

除了正常的滴眼药水、去医院定期做眼部按摩和每日定时放松眼睛之外，发现一个很有效的方法，每天早晚两次使用热毛巾热敷 10min
不建议用蒸汽眼罩
温度和水分都不够，效果不行
热敷时间
如果时间不够，建议睡觉前，不用太久，10 ～ 20 分钟左右，用一条热毛巾浸湿之后热敷。
如何判断效果
热敷完一般眼角会有一些黄色或者透明的分泌物
坚持一到两周，就能看到效果了]]></summary>

两个网口上的 DHCP 为客户端分配的网关是 192.168.1.1 和 192.168.2.1 ，DNS 同样。目前无论是接入 1 网段还是 2 网段，都可以正常上网，且访问互联网可以走移动联通各自线路。但是访问网易 DNS 检测，总会有一个网段 IP 和 DNS 不一致。我猜 ros 收到客户端请求后，只通过移动联通之一去请求了 doh ，所以会出现移动网段的客户端请求到联通的 ip 地址。
现在临时的解决办法是给其中一个网段指派同网段 openwrt 为 DNS ，然后在 openwrt 里设置一个公共 DNS 。这样网易 DNS 检测才会正常。
请问各位如果只通过 ros 设置能解决这类 DNS 问题吗?]]></summary>

他们都是名校毕业，学理科，传统制造业和计算机行业。也都是价值观非常正派，求真务实，不坑蒙拐骗别人钱财和感情，不乱包装销售自己的人，于是也让自己非常非常的孤独，因为永远觉得自己不够好，永远没有准备好。
不太幸福，也不快乐，永远焦虑，永远自我怀疑，钱多也焦虑，没钱也焦虑，优秀也焦虑，不优秀更焦虑。那种以为自己赚钱了就不焦虑的状态并达不到，为什么得到钱之后，还是焦虑。
为什么亚洲人永远要活在成功学里面。中国理工科人，特别是男生，大概是当今全世界精神压力最高的群体，没有之一了。
同学 1:
父母清华的，家世太好，考试几乎门门都是满分，连语文都是只扣 2 分，扣的是作文，其他语文题都是满分。
念书之后，那是念遍世界名校，最后也说卷的太累。以为人生就是一道又一道题，做好就行，最后发现，人生好像，不是做题欸。倒是父母给花的学费钱，要努力还给父母。不然自己以后换职业，都需要照顾父母面子。父母朋友都是那样，大学教授，单位中层干部，谁家的小孩，不是父母的面子呢，各家小孩，从小学就开始比，告诉我她从小就在的高要求下长大，不仅需要成绩好，连道德水平，待人接物，那是啥都要标准模板必须做到。进入社会才发现，原来事事可以做到 60 分，自己曾经努力的 100 分，是一种过度用力。为此感叹过去很多年，没有什么同龄人的生活，没有童年，青年欸。现在节奏慢下来，告诉我，哇，原来这才是人生啊。呜呜呜，原来可以这样简单做到啊。原来做到 60 分不是耻辱啊。
同学 2：
父母好像是保健品公司的小干部，父母爱卷的不行，他从小在家就和自己父母竞争上了。家里从来没有任何娱乐，父母不是在家学习工作，就是在外面参加行业活动，周末也不例外。这同学可能还是数学太好，从小竞赛金牌，一路保送至顶尖名校，现在熬出头了竟然告诉我说，看见代码心里就有阴影了。 一个多年搞竞赛，秒杀国内外竞赛的人，竟然看着自己最熟悉又擅长的东西，感到恐惧。同时因为自己形象太高大，出名之后，又太多学弟学妹的膜拜，自己反而不能做真实的自己了。在一个海边城市住，但是从来没去过海边，说永远有弄不完的项目，还是那句话，说自己没有生活。
同学 3：
父亲是公务员，同学本身成绩还可以，但是和前两个同学比，就算成绩普通的一般人。父亲一直让他考公务员，哇塞考 5 年了，考不上，同学都要精神崩溃了，给他讲了一下现在考的人太多了，胜算几率太小了，没事的不要逼迫自己。但是他真不行，在父亲面前，真是不敢说话。我真担心他就像新闻里面的那些考 n 年没上的人一样，精神崩溃了。
总结：
他们本身都很优秀，但是父母的确是时代红利，太过闪亮，他们别说超越父母，就和父母平起平坐都很困难。再加上自己说的，从小不知道什么是生活，彷佛，自己只要在一次又一次竞争中，得到胜利，就可以得到那个遥远的幸福。却说，当得到一切之后，自己已经失去了感知快乐的能力，只是把它当作一个任务完成了而已。
还有，他们的父母好像都不允许他们，袒露自己的情感，不管是快乐的情感，还是悲伤，愤怒的情感，情感这块好像一直是一种压抑，未发育的状态。既无法表达自己的情感，可能是所处环境总是拒绝他们的情感需求，表达悲伤没有被安抚过，反而被父母说无用。所以早就关闭了这个情感通道，长大之后，也很难和其他人，建立深度的情感链接，不管是友情，还是亲密异性关系。哎~~父母太成功的小孩，真的有自我发展自己，生长成为一个自然形态的人的空间吗？不知道他们何时才能放下。幸福和快乐其实可以很简单。
生活能把握住 60 分已经很不错了。不容易啊不容易。。]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[我这台电脑能用 Type-C (DP)和 HDMI 输出视频，外接显示器也能分别用这两种信号显示。
买副屏之后才发现这个现象的，外接屏在系统进入锁屏界面之前不显示任何画面，只有无信号的待机画面。也就是说，把屏幕设置成“仅在 2 上显示“，那么下次开机的时候开机画面（ OEM Logo ）仍在内置显示器上播放。
同理，重启到 BIOS 或 PE 系统里面也是类似现象，这两种环境貌似都不能识别外接屏，只能在内置屏里显示画面。
如标题所示，有办法做到么？]]></summary>

平时倒是很流畅，但是时不时会出现显示异常的情况，具体表现在大多数应用的窗口突然有一部分变成空白，或者无法点击等等，随着鼠标的点击这个异常的范围还可能扩大，比如某 IM 开始是置顶联系人消失变成一大块白色，再点两下聊天内容也整个消失变成白色了。
之前我是重启之后会恢复，然后最近我发现好像关掉几个内存占用大户也能马上恢复，比如重启 jb 全家桶。
这样看就感觉跟苹果芯片和内存有点关系，但是我看监控内存压力一直是绿的，而且已使用内存也不超过 30G 。网上也没找到类似的讨论，有没有大佬遇到过或者知道这是个啥情况，有没有办法规避...]]></summary>

 Hello, r/Linux.
 I don't really have a deep, technical write up for you, but my thoughts and obersvations over the years about software availability for Linux. I'll try to keep this short!
 I've been using Linux since 2011. Back in those days, certain types of software was hard to come by and some online services for Linux were very limited. Y'all remember the days when Netflix was a PITA to get working correctly (looking at you, MS Silverlight), gaming on Linux wasn't a thing, I don't remember if Spotify was available for Linux, and a bunch of other stuff SUCKED if you wanted it on Linux.
 During those days, it became very clear to me that Progressive Web Apps (PWAs) were going to be invaluable for my user experience on Linux. I still rem…]]></summary>

 And I just found https://ordiluc.net/fs/libetc/ . Anyone here used it? I'm interested in using it, albeit making it move its files to /home/(user).dot instead of .config, since some software is cursed enough to use both at once.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[大家好,我是一名独立开发者,平时工作中经常会遇到需要快速获取信息、生成文本等需求。最近我开发了一款 AI 桌面小工具,感觉能够显著提升工作效率,在此分享给大家。
这款工具支持接入 OpenAI 和 Claude 两种 API,用户可以根据自己的偏好灵活选择(需要提供自己的 API Key)。为了让大家开箱即用,我还内置了一些实用的提示模板,涵盖了编程、翻译、写作等多个领域。
日常使用中,全局快捷键可以让你一键唤醒 AI 助手,输入问题即可快速得到答案。而且对话次数没有任何限制,不用担心额度问题。
除了程序员,我觉得其他领域的朋友应该也能从中受益。大家如果感兴趣的话,不妨下载试用一下。我很乐意倾听你们的反馈和建议,帮助我把这个工具做得更好。

最后附上下载链接: https://www.gptaiflow.com/zh/download
hello@gptaiflow.com
希望这个小工具能给大家的工作生活带来一些便利。祝各位 V 友工作顺利,生活愉快!]]></summary>

索引的数据结构
索引失效的场景和为什么失效
redis 相关：
主从备份是怎么做的
加解密鉴权：
oauth2
jwt
session （这个感觉比较古老）
算法：

忘了？猪脑发作了
面完个人总结是面试前看看面经还是很有用的，我基本是全命中了。还是得靠短时记忆才记得住。
[故事 body ] 
面试的公司是做牙齿矫正的医院/诊所的服务商的，大概是做用于识别牙齿问题的软件。
我问了赚不赚钱，他说挺赚钱的，毕竟矫正很贵，公司都在扩张，还说基本靠算法组识别的准。
然后我面试完顺路去口腔诊所领新一轮的牙套。刚好就碰到医生在和推销软件的客户经理或者销售吧，在 battle 。聊软件试用的事情。医生一会儿说一年要 3000 ，300 都要考虑，然后说用户习惯都没养成也不给个试用的方案。又说现在环境也不好。突出一个没钱。
寻思虽然应该不是同一个公司的软件，但这种强烈的反差感还是带着点幽默在的，关键是我居然还能刚好碰到两件事撞在一起。]]></summary>

Hi HN! We’re Bolu and Noah from AnswerGrid (https://answergrid.ai). We’re building an AI-powered web research tool in the form of a spreadsheet. The problem we’re starting with is helping founders who sell to businesses discover the most relevant leads worth the investment of manual outbound (that is, worth putting in the effort to write a personalized outreach message to see if they might be interested).
There’s a demo video here: https://www.loom.com/share/fe4e40fa000b4406910a9ce247079138?..., and you can try the actual product at https://app.answergrid.ai/try-it (no signup needed!)
One of the biggest problems B2B founders have, once they’ve built an initial product, is finding initial companies to sell to. There’s a…]]></summary>

Building modern apps these days involves a lot of schleps. For a basic CRUD app you need to spin up servers, wire up endpoints, integrate auth, add permissions, and then marshal data from the backend to the frontend and back again. If you want to deliver a buttery smooth user experience, you’ll need to add optimistic updates and rollbacks. We do these steps over and over for every feature we build, which can make it difficult to build delightful software. Could it be better?
We were senior and staff engineers at Facebook and Airbnb and had been thinking about this problem for years. In 2021, Stopa wrote an ess…]]></summary>

Arva uses an AI agent to automate the manual verification that every banking/fintech does when they get a new business customer. This is called “Know Your Business” compliance (KYB for short) and it’s a royal pain.
There’s a demo video here: https://www.arva-ai.com/loom , and if you’re curious to try it out for yourself, you can onboard onto ‘Arva Bank’ and see what happens when you upload some fake documents: https://platform.arva-ai.com/demo (but please don’t upload any sensitive documents!)
What’s this about? When a business onboards onto a bank or fintech (i.e. applies to be a customer), a human analyst has to conduct extensive manual verification a lot of the time. This causes long onboarding times, and there…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[站长如何选择博客平台?在选择博客平台时，需要综合考虑多个因素，包括平台的易用性、功能、自定义能力、社区支持、成本以及是否满足个人或企业的特定需求 http://m.bokequ.com/list/22-0.html
　　以下是一些建议，帮助您选择适合的博客平台：
　　 1. 评估平台类型
　　综合性平台
　　优点：用户基数大，易于上手，提供丰富的模板和插件，SEO 优化较好，有助于内容推广。
　　代表平台：新浪博客、博客园等。这些平台适合博客新手或偶尔写作的人。
　　开源博客系统
　　优点：提供高度的自定义能力，可以根据个人喜好设计博客的外观和功能，支持多平台同步发布。
　　代表平台：WordPress 、Typecho 等。这些系统适合有一定写作经验和追求个性化的博主。
　　专业内容平台
　　优点：提供更高的流量和关注度，有助于内容的传播，同时提供丰富的商业合作机会。
　　代表平台：知乎专栏、简书等。这些平台适合专业写手或自媒体人。
　　 2. 考虑关键功能
　　自定义能力：选择能够完全控制博客外观和功能的平台，如 WordPress 。
　　 SEO 优化：确保平台具备良好的 SEO 性能，以便提高博客的可见性和访问量。
　　社区支持：选择拥有活跃社区的平台，有助于内容分享和互动。
　　插件和主题：查看平台是否提供丰富的插件和主题，以满足不同的功能需求和设计风格。
　　 3. 成本考量
　　免费与付费：许多平台提供免费和付费两种选项。免费选项通常有限制(如广告、存储限制等)，而付费选项则提供更多功能和更好的用户体验。
　　长期成本：如果计划长期运营博客，需要考虑平台的升级费用、域名和服务器费用等长期成本。
　　 4. 用户体验
　　易用性：选择界面友好、易于操作的平台，以便快速上手和高效管理博客。
　　编辑器功能：特别是对于喜欢使用 Markdown 等轻量级标记语言的用户，需要选择支持 Markdown 的编辑器。
　　 5. 特定需求
　　内容类型：如果主要发布图片、视频等多媒体内容，需要选择支持这些媒体类型的平台。
　　国际化需求：如果博客面向全球受众，需要选择支持多语言和多地区的平台。
　　 6. 示例对比
　　以 WordPress 为例，它提供了广泛的自定义选项、强大的插件生态系统和 SEO 友好性，但需要一定的技术知识和资源投入。而知乎专栏则是一个适合专业和深度内容创作者的平台，拥有广泛的受众和友好的用户界面。
　　总结：选择博客平台时，请根据您的个人或企业需求、技术水平、成本预算以及长期规划进行综合考虑。通过比较不同平台的优缺点，选择最适合您的博客平台。同时，记得定期评估和调整您的博客平台策略，以适应不断变化的网络环境和市场需求。]]></summary>

1 、直接对此字段加索引？ 但 gpt 回答，还未自己验证，如果索引离散度太低，可能 mysql 查询优化器会自动退化为全表扫描
2 、再建一个新表，专门存状态为‘是’的数据的 id 。 相当于自建了一个仅包含部分数据的索引， 但这种又会增加代码复杂度，对业务逻辑有侵入]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[主题：在迷茫和坚定之间徘徊
背景：
大专学历，自考电子科大本科，专科和自考都是电子信息专业
有一年消费电子开发经验，软硬件都做，技术线比较简单，51 单片机那一套。
3 年技术支持经历
过程：
从事技术支持的时候，就预感这是个职业生涯的雷，没有过硬的技术积累，都是擦屁股和客户交流那一套，于是想捡起我的专业知识，继续干嵌入式
4 月底离职的时候嵌入式岗位很多，我只投了嵌入式软件工程师。当时做了一个 K210 的实体项目，就拿着这个项目去面试了，第一个面试就直接给 offer ，这个岗位是 freeRTOS 那一套；当时手上还有另外一个军工行业的 offer ，拒绝了，就去了第一家给 offer 的单位，工作了半个月，觉得我技术不行，直接劝退了，于是失业
失业的时候我个人感觉理亏，确实待了 10 天没出什么活，这家公司是个方案公司，其他人每天都会出做好的方案，我没啥进度，同事有五六个，HR 劝退我的时候我个人也不够硬气，主要是我自己也觉得能力不足，就直接离职了，没有什么纠缠
结果：
失业后休息了一个月，然后陆陆续续找工作，简历都石沉大海，HR 已读都很少，基本上都是红海了，可能和毕业生大批量毕业有关，很多岗位都招满了
抽时间学了学 GD32 单片机，顺便把 stm32 的知识点复习了一遍，跟着例程实现效果
由于没有工作，进入漫长的迷茫期，HR 都是已读不回，期间有面试几个岗位，也许是我要价稍高和技能差，等结果的时候都通知没有过，还花了 1 元买了 1 天的 BOSS 直聘的会员，发现我面试的初级嵌入式岗位，都有接近 500 人投简历，HR 大概抽了一小部分约面，反正我就是被刷了
继续进入漫长的迷茫期
等到 8 月，实在是几个招聘软件都没人鸟我，开始接私单，第一个项目是一个无人遥控船，涉及到无线通信，FreeRTOS 、LVGL 用的几个芯片是 stm32H7 、F4 ，捣鼓了一下，功能实现了。然后接了第二单：瘫痪病人的护理床，我只写软件，目前这个还在开发中
继续等待，继续投简历，在没有入职公司的时候只能通过接单来提升个人项目经验，以及混口饭吃
这就是我最近几个月的经历，后期持续更新，有热心的老哥也请提供一些建议，目前我的技能只会 stm32+FreeRTOS+LVGL 这一套，硬件会但是不精通，PCB 也会画，但是不美观]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[在 React 世界里，useEffect 和 useState 无疑是最常见的钩子（ Hooks ），它们让函数组件拥有了类组件的力量。useState 赋予了组件维护状态的能力，而 useEffect 则让副作用管理变得简单。
对许多开发者来说，上述两个 Hooks 是 React 钩子的入门级应用，但随着项目复杂度的提升，仅仅使用这两个钩子可能会让组件变得臃肿，逻辑复杂难以维护。此时，众多开源社区的 React Hooks 库应运而生，它们提供了许多高质量、语义化的 Hooks ，帮助开发者更好地管理组件状态、副作用等，提升代码质量。@shined/react-use 就是这样一款优秀的 React Hooks 库。
本文旨在充分利用 @shined/react-use 提供的 Hooks ，呈现一份全面的基于 React Hooks 的代码质量提升指南，引导你走出 useEffect 和 useState 的舒适区，发掘 React Hooks 的真正潜力和灵活性，提升项目代码质量。
替换 useState
useState 是 React 中用来管理组件状态的 Hook ，基本上每个 React 开发者都会用到。
但是低版本 React 中的 useState 可能导致非预期的行为。比如在 React <= 17 时，当组件卸载后，调用 setState 会抛出令人困惑的警告（参考 安全状态）。此外，React 内部使用浅比较来判断状态是否改变，这可能会导致组件进行不必要的重渲染，从而影响性能。
useSafeState
useSafeState 被设计为 useState 的直接替代方案，用于规避低版本 React 下的警告问题，并遵循官方做法在高版本 React 下与 useState 行为保持一致。
同时它还具备可选的性能优化特性（deep 选项，深度比较状…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[发现自己情况有点类似，本来想回复的，索性直接开一帖，把一些话发出来也给自己解解压。
我今年也 28 了，之前在一家医疗行业做前端开发，其实还是挺不错的，后面因为各种原因（这里说一下一个是工资一直没涨，我在公司负责的内容越来越多。另一个是当时买的基金亏钱了亏了 20%左右大概 2w 多，直接影响了每天的心情）长时间下来我觉得我也抑郁了，反正就是每天一到公司内心就开始难受，就想离职。在 23 年年初过完年我直接裸辞了，当时我也知道行情不好，还是毅然选择裸辞。当时跟领导提出要辞职后心里一下就好受多了，感觉一块大石头落地那种感觉。
后面开始找工作，找了两个月没找到有点焦虑了，终于在 5 月份拿到了一份工作，薪资也有涨，技术栈从 vue 转到 react ，我觉得能胜任然后当时也不是很想继续再找了，就入职了。事实做下来技术这块也确实没问题，react 上手的很快。不过有个问题是做的事比较多，不是指开发，公司没有产品没有 ui ，原型图要前端去画，功能设计还要我自己去想，只有一个大纲。所以有点受不了，再加上买的基金没有及早抽身出来又亏了不少，还有下半年的时候我妈身体不好，去医院也花了不少钱做了不少次检查，最后也没查出具体问题（腹部痛腿痛这些，肠镜胃镜都做了也没查出问题），最后在新冠病毒变异时我中招了，身体上很难受再加上心里上的长期压抑，导致我又一次冲动离职。回到公司第二天我就跟领导提了。
之后本来打算尽快找到工作的，然后找了两个月没什么回复，就索性懒得找了，准备躺平。
人一闲下来就容易胡思乱想，就觉得看不到希望，在大城市房子也买不起，女朋友也没有。没人可以倾诉，不跟父母倾诉也是不想让他们担心。有时候真的就觉得活得好没意思，好痛苦。
8 月初我注销了基金账户，简单收拾了下行李来合肥找工作（离家近，芜湖），投了两个星期吧，拿了 3 个 offer ，拒掉其中一个，选择了一家小公司，部门是初创的 2 前端 2 后端。入职一周的时候 hr 交社保的时候被告知社保是代缴的（什么人力资源公司），因为公司注册地不在合肥，这个是之前沟通时没跟提过，唉不过我自己也没问。然后我正好打算申请合肥的住房补贴（一个月 1250 ），结果这样我就不能申请了。于是我找了之前的一个 offer ，讯飞外包，准备去干着看看。这里也是非常冲动，没怎么考虑。
去了外包后发现内网开发真受不了，办公电脑配置也差的要死 8g 内存。
我当天就不干了，然后我又想回原来那家，但被 hr 告知离职公司规定离职后不得再入职了，其实我也是厚着脸皮了，正常人肯定不会再去找原单位了
也是自从第一次离职后，感觉我越来越容易冲动离职了。第一次离职我犹豫了半年。
现在的情况是合肥这边岗位少的可怜，能投的基本都被投过了。
唉大好的机会给我却被我浪费了。
后续也不知道怎么办了，有想过要么回上海继续找。
说出来后感觉轻松了一点，今天一天心情真的超压抑]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[最近刚刚折腾了一把，分享下我买美区 AC+的过程，也想问问有没有人在中国大陆/香港使用过美区 AC+的？使用的体验是什么样的？
因为 Apple Intelligence 锁中国大陆的硬件，于是把原来的国行 AC+的 iPad Pro M1 卖掉了，找人从澳门伦敦人的 Apple Store 带回来了一台 M4 的 iPad Pro ，有小票。
结果因为不熟悉情况，收到才发现澳门和香港的 iPad 还是有区别的，具体在于澳门的不能在 iPad 设置里面买 AC+，只能线下购买或者电话购买。
先是尝试去拨打澳门的 Apple Support 电话，结果无法接通，退而求其次拨打澳门伦敦人店的电话，结果那时候他们还没开业，不在营业时间 w 不接电话。
最终拨打了香港的 Apple Support 电话，接通之后发现只有广东话和英语，就选择了英语客服。之后的过程倒是挺顺利的，只是由于没有显示 this device is eligible for AppleCare+，客服让我额外运行并且上传了个设备诊断日志作为补充。客服还说按月订阅的方案无法选择，只能先买两年的。
购买的 AppleCare+是与当前登录的 Apple ID 绑定的，我登录的是美区，所以收到的邮件就是美区 AC+的链接，点进去之后支付只支持美国发行的卡，无论是输入 cvv 还是直接 Apple Pay ，还好我有张美卡，支付顺利。这里还有个题外话题外话，当时我问客服港卡是否可以支付，她告诉我可以，结果最终验证结果是不行的。
买完之后很快就收到了邮件，AppleCare+ Proof of Coverage ，另外买完之后如果你还有 Apple Pencil Pro 或者 Magic Keyboard 的话，需要把序列号也报给客服，她再做一次绑定。
这次算是踩了一个坑，按理说我这种直营店买的有收据的也不会被刁难使用 AC+，不知道有没有人真的在中国大陆或者香港用过美区 AC+，是什么体验？]]></summary>

One user report is on a commercial video game from 2009 with a ~7 MiB Windows executable written in C++: it was delinked without its C runtime library and then relinked into a new executable at a different base address, with no visible change in functionality, as a prelude to a decompilation project.
Use-cases I've demonstrated on my blog include modding, making software ports, converting executable file formats, creating libraries... I've originally built this as part of a video game decompilation project ; I've been working on this over the past 2.5 years and recently it has started gaining some users besides me.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey everyone! I ran into a funny (and slightly stressful) situation while installing Ubuntu on my Raspberry Pi 5, and I thought I’d share it here. Maybe it’ll help someone, or at least give you a good laugh.
 So, I’ve got a Bluetooth mouse and a Bluetooth keyboard. But, as it turns out, during the Ubuntu installation, they’re pretty much useless because the keyboard won’t connect. I ended up stuck on the screen where you need to enter your username, computer name, and password. And that’s when I realized—without a keyboard, I’m totally screwed. 🤦‍♂️
 After digging through some old boxes, I managed to find an ancient wired mouse—my savior (well, almost). The first steps of the installation, like choosing the language and localization, went smoothly, but then came the part where I had to type stuff… and that’s where things got tricky.
 I started frantically Googling for a solution on my phone, and then I accidentally noticed that I could highlight the text labels in the form fields. Right-clicked, and boom—there were options to “Copy” and “Paste.” That’s when it hit me! I started copying and pasting letters and words from these labels to fill in all the fields.
 One letter at a time, one symbol at a time, but I finally made it through the installation! 😅
 Afterward, I managed to get the Bluetooth keyboard working, and everything was fine. But this experience is something I’ll definitely remember for a long time.
 So, if anyone ever finds themselves in a similar mess—don’t give up! There’s always a way out. And big thanks to my old wired mouse for saving the day. 🖱️

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I work on my own computers - both a desktop (primarily) and laptop when I travel. I used Linux a while back for personal computing, and really wanted to make the switch again. I'm not really a fan of a lot of things that MS is doing (like the forced CoPilot) and figured I would be just a productive on Linux (I chose Kubuntu). Unfortunately, after many hours, I just am not.
 My role is that of an analyst and ad-hoc (not production) dev. For tasks like coding and SQL queries, and our web-based front end tools, Linux is fine. Not really any better than Windows, but not holding me back. However, my org is heavy into the MS ecosystem, and that's where the issues arise. 
 Web based office sucks. It's workable for basic word and excel tasks, so I figured I could use that and a VM for more complex tasks. Which I could, but it's nowhere near as seamless as on a Windows machine (where I never work on any Office docs in a browser). Web based outlook kind of sucks, and Thunderbird just doesn't offer the full outlook experience with the multiple calendars and inboxes I have to manage.
 The other issue is I would have to ditch Google Drive. Self-Host seems the way to go for this. There are downsides with this as well, unfortunately.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I found a way of making Chromium-based browsers use hardware video acceleration when running on Wayland-native mode and using Intel graphics. Please note this tutorial won't work on X11 (I'm pretty sure it should work out of the box on X11 on Intel graphics). This has been tested on Chromium 127, using MESA 24.1.6 on Plasma 6.1.4 Wayland and Fedora 40, using Intel Ice Lake graphics (10th generation). This will likely work for other Chromium-based browsers, like Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge, Opera, Vivaldi, etc.
 All you need to do is to enable the following arguments:
 --ozone-platform=wayland --enable-features=VaapiVideoDecodeLinuxGL,VaapiVideoEncoder --ignore-gpu-blocklist
 On Plasma, you can use the Menu Editor application to add those arguments to the "Command-Line Arguments" field (append them at the end), after that, all you have to do is to save your changes and restart your browser. On other desktop environments you might have to edit the Exec line on the .desktop shortcut of your browser, usually located either in /home/your_username/.local/share/applications/ or /usr/share/applications/ (you can use sudo nano /usr/share/applications/browser_name.desktop to edit the files there, or another editor with root support of your choice)
 To confirm it's working, you can install the intel-gpu-tools package for your distribution (sudo apt install intel-gpu-tools on Ubuntu, sudo dnf install intel-gpu-tools on Fedora, and so on) and run sudo intel_gpu_top, then, play a video and check in the terminal if the video usage percentage goes above zero.
 I hope that helps!

 I don't like Windows at all. But I need to use Windows, because Adobe/Affinity suite is available only on Windows. Because MS Word, Outlook is used in businesses, only on Windows.

Hello HN, I'm excited to share a project I've been working on called VirtualStorageLibrary. It's a .NET library designed to manage in-memory tree structures, including items, directories, and symbolic links.
VirtualStorageLibrary is a .NET library that operates entirely in-memory and provides a tree-structured collection. This library offers a foundation for managing hierarchical data structures, supporting items, directories, and symbolic links that encapsulate user-defined types  (generic types defined by the user). This library is not a file system. Instead, it was redesigned from scratch to create a more flexible and user-friendly tree structure. The library aims to make it intuitive to reference, traverse, and manipul…]]></summary>

我们一直有职位空缺： https://www.arcblock.io/content/docs/arcblock/zh/join-us 
但我们的招聘流程和要求比较独特，导致一些同学觉得困难，甚至浪费了时间。 刚好看到上周有同学在我们面试有一些不顺利的经历，以及看到一些回复的讨论，觉得有必要回复一下。 
欢迎看完我们的这些八卦仍然觉得我们这里适合你的同学给我们简历！(简历发到： hr@arcblock.io )
原帖：
https://www.v2ex.com/t/1066039?p=2#reply173 
这是我的回复：
感谢分享 ArcBlock 的面试经验（第四家公司），我是 ArcBlock 的 founder 也是你的最后一面面试者。 我已经让我们 HR 和你联系，是否愿意我们把你的面经作为一个案例来帮助更多的人更好面试， 如果愿意的话，我们把我们自己的四个面试反馈也分享出来对比一下，这样读者可以从两个角度看到求职者和面试官的看法。（不愿意也没有关系，这是隐私）
你是不错的自学成才的工程师，没有通过一些面试并不说明你的能力有问题，而只是和工作职位不匹配而已。我们也是看到你的相当不错的开源项目的参与记录，因此花了较多时间来考察是否匹配我们，也许你不久就能找到适合自己节奏的工作。
我们自己对学历一点不在意，我知道很多优秀的团队和公司也不太在意学历； 你的工资要求也完全处于我们这个职位预算以内。不存在是因为学历和薪资等浪费你时间。
我们的面试题难度不大，不需要刷题，但需要相当扎实的基本功。我们团队的人重新面试的话，我估计 100% 能通过。😂
这是我们自己写的一篇《如何轻松通过 ArcBlock 的招聘流程》：
https://www.arcblock.io/blog/zh/post/2020/07/24/how-to-get-through-arcblock-interview-process
我写这个回复，以及想写一个对比的文章，足以说明我们求贤若渴，不想让这篇文章导致求职者认为我们浪费面试的时间。 但也同时是一个“劝退贴”，如果觉得这个流程和考察方式不适合自己的话， 面试过程只是真正工作的缩影，一定要投适合自己的职位。]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[小团队的困境与 AI：我们为什么要尝试开发"AI 员工"？
大家好，我是一个 5 人小团队的创始人，最近我们在思考一个问题：如何突破小团队的资源限制？这让我们开始尝试开发一个我们称之为"AI 员工"的项目。想和大家分享一下我们的思路，也很想听听各位的看法。
小团队的日常挑战
作为一个由 3 名开发、1 名财务行政和 1 名销售组成的小团队，我们每天都面临这些问题：
人手不足：每个人都"全栈"，经常需要处理本职之外的工作。
技能缺口：有些专业领域我们难以覆盖到。
效率瓶颈：大量时间耗费在重复性工作上。
难以扩张：增加人手对我们来说是一个大决定，风险不小。
我想很多小团队或许都有类似的感受？
现有 AI 工具的不足
我们也尝试过市面上的各种 AI 工具，但总觉得差点意思：
通用 AI 助手：能聊天，但不了解我们的具体业务。
专业 AI 工具：解决单一问题不错，但缺乏整体协作能力。
现有 Agent：自主性不够，难以独立完成复杂任务。
"AI 员工"的构想
基于这些痛点，我们开始构想一个更进阶的 AI 系统。我们希望它能：
深度个性化：真正了解团队、项目和工作方式。
全栈能力：能够胜任多个角色，从编码到项目管理。
持续学习：从日常交互中不断提升自己。
自主工作：能独立完成复杂任务。
无缝集成：与现有工作流程自然衔接。
说实话，我们也不确定这是否能实现，但我们觉得值得一试。
当前进展
目前我们正在积极开发中，希望能在 3 个月内有一个初步的版本。已经有两位朋友表示了兴趣，他们的反馈给了我们很大鼓舞。
想法交流
各位觉得这个想法可行吗？有什么潜在的问题？
如果有这样一个"AI 员工"，你会希望它具备什么能力？
在开发过程中，你认为我们应该特别注意什么？
如果你对这个话题感兴趣，欢迎来我们的论坛一起讨论。
作为一个小团队，我们真的很想知道其他人是如何看待和解决这些挑战的。期待听到大家的想法！
PS: 如果你对我们的项目感兴趣，我们现在有一个早期支持计划：
支持金额：19.9 美元
福利：锁定未来 50%的折扣权益
额外好处：首个版本发布后优先体验
名额：仅开放 98 个
详情可以查看我们的项目页面。无论是否参与，你的想法和建议对我们都非常宝贵。]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi HN! We’re Towaki and Allen, and we’re building Outerport (https://outerport.com), a distribution network for AI model weights that enables ‘hot-swapping’ of AI models to save on GPU costs.
‘Hot-swapping’ lets you serve different models on the same GPU machine with only ~2 second swap times (~150x faster than baseline). You can see this in action through a live demo where you try the same prompts on different open source large language models at https://hotswap.outerport.com and see the docs here https://docs.outerport.com.
Running AI models on the cloud is expensive. Outerport came from our own experience working on AI services ourselves and struggling with the cost.
Cloud GPUs are charged by the amount of time used. A long start-up time (from loading models into GPU memory) means that …]]></summary>

去买美元 5%收益的美元国债或者货基

自己没买过美元的 上面这个操作算合理的吗
1 有必要这么绕吗 能不能直接在香港招商卡上买国债或者货基？或者有比富途更好的平台吗
2 换美元 打款 买理财 貌似都有折损（汇率 手续费）  有什么办法尽量减少这个折损吗

或者大家有别的美元理财建议也可以]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[起因
由于之前常常要在电视上（或者跨设备）输入网址下载或者配置东西，每次要手动去生成短链，后面的内容也不能随心所欲，所以搞了个短的域名：ause.cc, 自己启动了个短链服务。试了几个，yourls/slash/cf 等好几个，都不理想，后来使用了  Sink 这个开源的还不错。基本都满足要求，还不用挂 vps ，直接全部 CF 挂上。美滋滋。
优缺点
👍🏻 网页精美
👍🏻 只给自己用
👍🏻 不需要服务器，完全免费托管
👍🏻 数据分析、显示链接点击数，点击区域、设备等
❌ 只有网页端，没有 Chrome/Edge Extension
❌ 有流量限制
❌ 只能自己用（没有个用户系统）
造轮子
没有就造一个轮子 Sink Tool。
顺手搞了个 Chrome/Edge 小插件，欢迎品尝！！留个小星星呀！

exec user process caused: exec format err
一开始以为是镜像本身问题，但是本地运行是跑通状态的。
于是改回：

服务端再部署，正常运行。
是服务端 docker 哪儿没有配置好吗？关键是本地也没怎么配置..]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This is a continuation of my HDR on Linux series, building upon setting up HDR on Intel laptops.
 So basically this is a nice handy way to identify YouTube videos that have HDR versions, and open the links in MPV player which can play HDR (no browser supports it on Linux yet). It consists of a Chrome extension, and a Python script. The extension will add a button on YouTube videos which are available in HDR. Clicking this button will launch MPV, which will play the video in HDR. The Python script is the one that actually launches MPV, once it receives a request from the Chrome extension. 
 Tested on Manjaro KDE, can work on Gnome too, as long as you are able to get HDR working on MPV, which seems possible

        <id>https://www.v2ex.com/t/1066813#reply5</id>
        <link href="https://www.v2ex.com/t/1066813#reply5"/>
        <updated>2024-08-21T10:57:27.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[代码如下：
http{

   limit_req_zone $binary_remote_addr zone=mylimit:1m rate=6r/m;
   
   server {
      listen 80;
      ......
      location / {
         limit_req zone=mylimit burst=5;
         proxy_pass http://www.baidu.com;
      }
   }
}

对于 burst ，nginx 给的解释是：
https://blog.nginx.org/blog/rate-limiting-nginx#:~:text=The%20burst%20parameter%20defines,requests%20go%20over%C2%A020.
摘录如下：
The burst parameter defines how many requests a client can make in excess of the rate specified by the zone (with our sample mylimit zone, the rate limit is 10 requests per second, or 1 every 100ms). A request that arrives sooner than 100ms after the previous one is put in a queue, and here we are setting the queue size to 20.

That means if 21 requests arrive from a given IP address simultaneously, NGINX forwards the first one to the upstream server group immediately and puts the remaining 20 in the queue. It then forwards a queued request every 100ms, and returns 503 to the client only if an incoming request makes the number of queued requests go over 20.

结合代码和这段文字，我对 burst 的理解是：
6r/m：以每 1 分钟为一个时间阶段，将这 1 分钟分为 6 段，即每 10s 最多接收 1 个请求，该 10s 内的多余请求将会被返回 503 ；
burst=5：突发队列长度=5 。以每 1 分钟为一个时间阶段，在这 1 分钟内，该队列最多只能接受 5 个请求，即使该队列内的请求已经被处理，也不会往队列里新增新的请求，直到下 1 分钟到来。
测试
测试工具：jmeter 

预期结果：
在 120s 内，一共发起了 120 个请求，其中请求成功 22 个(6+6+5+5)，其余返回 503 ；
实际测试结果：
在 120s 内，一共发起了 120 个请求，其中请求成功 17 个(6+6+5)，其余返回 503 ；
为什么少了 5 个请求，希望大佬们为我指点下，谢谢~]]></summary>

适合到处找资源的数字仓鼠
虽说是创造，但整体思路基本是来自 小鱼标签 的，只是 小鱼标签 一直没兼容 webdav 方式，所以自写了一个，方便自己写个定时任务，自动化去重、合并清理记录。
作为数字仓鼠，经常忘记哪些东西(网址)是曾经下载过，提醒这个就是写此脚本的初衷，和 小鱼标签 目的完全不同，只是当初偶然发现 小鱼标签 能做这事，所以安装修改了小部分代码自用，但确实 json 不懂管理，才另写了这个
虽说是创造，但因为不太懂 js(停留在上世纪)，基本上是 chatgpt 完成的，chatgpt 最初给的是 jquery 语法，我直接否了，让它用原生 js 重写，因为完全看不懂 jquery ，苦笑
虽说是创造，但不主张版权，谁有兴趣随便拿去改着用，因为我已经废弃这个脚本不用了，另写了一个油猴+Flask+SQLite 的版本，但那个涉及很多隐私内容，要清理至少 1/3 才能公开，就懒得公开了
基于这个，此脚本的 bug 不修改了，所有事情用者自理，本人不承担任何责任和义务，相当于只提供一个思路
不做客服，不做客服，不做客服
这脚本非开箱即用
1. 需要将两个 csv 文件放到自己的 webdav 上面，并且修改 js 中的代码指向对应 url
2. webdav 默认需要账密，脚本中只写了最简单的 raw 鉴权方式(自行替换账密)，如果用户 webdav 不是这种鉴权方式，需要自行修改，反正其他方式我也不懂，哈哈，我自家就是在本地用 raw 鉴权的
3. 两个 csv 均为半角分号（强调一下不是逗号）分隔的格式，两个都需要自建，代码不能自行创建这两个文件，且 url_tags_regex.csv 里面每行数据需要自行手写，所以还需要懂正则
4. url_tags_regex.csv 中，hostname 列可以用半角逗号写多个域名，适用于不同 hostname 的镜像站，注意不是 domain ，需要完整匹配，没写通配检查，有需要请自行修改
5. url_tags_regex.csv 中，regex 列为 javascript 兼容方式的正则，且主要提取用于判断的内容，需要写在第一个小括号子匹配内，后面代码的逻辑是提取这个子匹配的。
备注一下：用正则是因为同一个站点也会出现链接写法的不同，例如 ?tid=xxxx 和 thread-xxxx.html 是指向同一个页面的，或者多个无关判断的 get 参数就会导致 url 不同，实际还是那个页面，且存在“打一枪换一个地方”(域名经常换)这种情况
6. url_tags.csv 中，tags 列如果以 "done" 字符串结尾，会将链接修改为“划掉”样式，不喜欢这个可自行修改 doneTextDecoration 和后面两个变量
7. url_tags_regex.csv 中有个 download 列，表示该网站为下载站(标记为 1)，当浏览器遇到打开匹配网址时，会弹一个 alert 提示这个已经下载过，download 没有标记的 hostname ，不会出现这个；不需要这个功能的，可以搜索 'if (downloadSites.has(window.location.hostname)) ...' 去掉这段代码块，或者 download 列整列留空
8. js 中 "// @connect 192.168.x.x" 这句也要改为 webdav 的 host 才能连接上读取 csv
9. 还有个重要的事，csv 的记录是 js append 的，所以修改标记提交后，会新增 datetime 为新增时的时间戳的一行（当然就会产生重复 url 记录了），也是因为自己偷懒没去想替换的逻辑，js 找到匹配并编辑 csv 感觉比较难，我当时就跳过这个留给 python 清理了。不过现在用 Flask 交给 sqlite 就简单了
还是那句：不做客服。我浏览器上已经撤了这个脚本，不再搞这 webdav 版本了，就提供一个可行思路而已，如果看不顺眼，下方有“忽略主题”，或关闭跳过此帖
其实 小鱼标签 已经做得很好了，而且还做了 opion 页，比这个强多了，idea 很妙，赞一个
这个只是方便备份和清理两个 csv 的数据而已，因为我习惯用 pandas 处理 csv ，json 我只会手工改，累。]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[项目地址：morytyann/OpenWrt-mihomo
功能:
透明代理(支持 TPROXY/TUN 模式,支持 IPv4 和/或 IPv6 代理)
局域网访问控制(根据 IP/MAC)
混入配置项(支持开启或关闭此功能,LuCI 包含了大部分常用的配置文件选项,还提供了混入文件内容的功能)
编辑器(在页面编辑上传的配置文件)
日志(插件日志/核心日志,核心日志可以查看自服务启动以来所有的日志)
特点：
简洁易上手
非常原生（简陋）的界面
符合逻辑的配置项罗列
因为不太喜欢 OC 的臃肿（我用了 4 年 OC ，没有说 OC 不好的意思，只是个人喜好），但我又喜欢使用 Clash/Mihomo ，于是我做了这个插件，主打简洁，在功能上保持克制，目标是做好透明代理就好。
欢迎大家来试用/使用这个插件，如果能点个 Star 就更好了！]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey everyone,
 I'm excited to finally share AutoVolume, an app I've been working on for a while! 🚀
 What does AutoVolume do?
 AutoVolume is perfect for anyone who listens to music on the go. Whether you're driving, running, or commuting, this app automatically adjusts your music volume based on your speed or the noise levels around you. Say goodbye to manually adjusting your volume while you’re busy!
 Key Features:
  
Speed-Based Volume Control: Ideal for driving or cycling. As your speed increases, the app automatically boosts the volume to keep your music at the perfect level.
 Noise-Based Volume Control: Adjusts volume based on ambient noise, offering a battery-efficient alternative that doesn’t require GPS.
 Easy to Use: Set up the app in just a few taps and let it handle the rest.
 Customizable: Choose your own volume ranges, sensitivity, and preferred mode to match your activity.
  
Why should you try it?
  
It’s perfect for music lovers who want hassle-free volume control while on the move.
 Especially useful for motorcyclists, drivers, and outdoor runners who need to stay focused.
  
The app is free to download, with an option to upgrade to a premium version for an ad-free experience and enhanced functionality.
 I’d love to hear your feedback, suggestions, or any issues you encounter to help me improve the app!

 I know I could just remap the right super to also use the left super command but I'm curious why that's not a default? 
 How do you use the right super? Did you remaped to something else that isn't a 'super' ? Is there a reason for the right super to not work?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I first started using Linux four years ago because I was frustrated with how long render times in Blender were taking on Windows. I stumbled upon a video by CG Geek that benchmarks Blender on Windows and Linux, showing that Blender on Linux is about twice as fast. After that, I immediately installed Linux Mint Cinnamon as my first distribution and have been using Linux as my main operating system ever since.
 I did face some challenges such as needing to install drivers for my TP-Link WiFi adapter. However, I'm really glad I stumbled across that one video because I didn't even know Linux existed before seeing it. Windows was constantly frustrating me and I thought I had to be stuck with it. Now, I understand that the benefits of Linux go far beyond just speed. Linux is free, hogs less of my memory, crashes programs less often, is more customizable, and much better for software development.

 Emacspeak supports using ViaVoice TTS, but IBM has long ago taken all resources related to this down from their website, and their FTP is such a maze I'll never find it there.
 There exists a version of the ViaVoice TTS libraries in a package called Voxin, which I own, but it's version 6.7.X which are known to have issues, but aside from that it just boggles my mind that seamingly all the rpm packages, tarballs, ETC are lost and as a data hoarder and completionist this hurts a lot so now I'm digging through literally any part of the internet I can to find it.
 If literally anyone has any additional information that might be useful in the search please do let me know. Even if there is a way to buy it somewhere, which I highly doubt, but I'm willing to spend a few bucks on seamingly lost software.

虽然我还算了解大厂的信息安全和审计，但是对网络运维方面还是小小白。
之前挂壁做了一个月的某视频平台审核，此项目仅需要访问甲方的网站，其余百度都不需要，这家公司用的是白名单的上网模式，这样是否就是低成本下最有效的网络管理。
何来此问
我之前上班发现的一个顶级摸鱼方法，家里电脑 24 小时不关机，公网 ip ，在公司用 RDP 远程，此时便可以随意摸鱼，工作生活环境分开，无缝衔接，摸起鱼来就像是在家里一样。
重点是 RDP 是微软自带，有些企业内远程软件例如思杰需要调用 RDP ，所以不会管理员禁用 RDP 功能。从信安和审计的监控角度来讲，这种连接只要低调，且不捅出大篓子就不太会被人发现。
但是如果是白名单模式的话，这种方法就没用了，为这个问题我还苦恼了几天，最后也是放弃了，我连电脑壁纸都是从甲方的官网新闻里下载的。Σ(⊙▽⊙"a]]></summary>

There are zero windows workstations in the whole warehouse. It's all Xubuntu. Ladies and gentlemen I am pleased to announce I'm officially and finally happy with the workstation I have at my actual job. Xubuntu isn't my favorite flavor of Ubuntu but it's a huge improvement over waiting 3 minutes to log in or rebooting for updates everytime I clock in. I have also found myself to be more comfortable and familiar with Linux systems than Windows after using Linux since I started tech school. Don't get me wrong I can still properly diagnose and repair windows but now it's not as fast as I can with Linux. Much love to my community ❤️

MinusX is a Chrome extension (https://minusx.ai/chrome-extension) that adds an AI sidechat to your analytics apps. Given an instruction, our agent operates your app (by clicking and typing, just like you would) to analyze data and answer queries. Broadly, you can do 3 types of things: ask for hypotheses and explore data, extend existing notebooks/dashboards, or select a region and ask questions. There's a simple video walkthrough here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BbHPyX2lJGI. The core idea is to "upgrade" existing tools, where people already do most of their data work, rather than building a new platform.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[自从去年 9 月公司散伙之后，boss 上沟通无数公司，几乎没有回复。本地有家公司给了个机会，上了几天班感觉不对，就没去了。之前在 v2 写了个帖子介绍这个经历。
前公司散伙的时候，前老板让我想办法把我之前做的 UWB 定位系统方案卖了，给我分成。然后我就建了个网站，也在知乎上写了些文章。
有不少人咨询，但是都没有下文，一直到 6 月份，才有一个公司表达了购买的意向，对方是国企，到现在合同都没签，他们还在走内部的流程。
去年底决定做独立开发。打算做一个自动运维的软件，折腾了几个月之后，发现还是应该继续搞 UWB 定位。
UWB 定位这个东西，我已经做出了一个完整的系统，还量产了，从技术的角度来说，也到了一定的深度。并且，在业内有一定的“知名度”，至少有不少人知道有这么个公司这么个人，在做这个事，效果还可以，技术也靠谱。
我可以把这个作为自己的立足点。之前做的东西，知识产权当然是前公司的，但是，我可以继续往深处搞/往广度搞，可以重新做出一套不同的东西出来。例如之前的系统是上行 TDOA 定位，我可以做下行 TDOA 定位，还可以增加 TOF 定位等等。以后可以靠卖技术卖方案挣钱。如果有人买老系统，我就跟前老板分成，如果买新系统，就是我自己的。于是就把以前弄的东西又翻出来，开始做一些以前想做但还没有做的事，把 UWB 定位继续往深处搞。
前两周，有个深圳的老板联系我，邀请我到他们公司上班。他是看了我在知乎上写的文章之后，大概觉得我还可以，是个合适的人选，所以联系我。
对方是个做嵌入式的初创公司，目前只有几个人。如果我过去，是负责软件这块工作，大概算是软件经理吧。
纠结了很久，从目前的情况来看，如果继续坚持弄 UWB 定位，收入很难保证。如果运气好，也许能挣点钱，如果运气不好，生活都困难。深圳这边如果上班，马上就会有工资收入。
但是这个年龄(56+)还要去深圳，实在是有点那啥。。。。
老板建议我可以先到深圳看一下，大家见个面，也到公司看看。然后我上周去了深圳。
最终决定还是去深圳吧。我跟老板说，先搞 3 个月试用期，大家都有足够的时间做出评估。如果大家都觉得 OK ，就继续下去；如果哪方觉得不行，随时可以中止。
跟老板沟通过几次，感觉老板是个技术上的大牛，一直在跟踪蓝牙标准，跟我谈到蓝牙标准有好多不足之处。虽然我对蓝牙不了解，但是感觉他说得比较有道理。老板的很多理念跟我相似，但是我不确定他是真的这样，还是投我所好。无所谓了，如果理念一致，大家相处会比较愉快；如果是投我所好，大家应该也会相处愉快。
在过往的职业生涯中，很多次从零开始组建团队，看样子这次也是要从零开始咯。]]></summary>

因为公司用微信办公，建一堆群压力很大？
因为作为律师/销售/教师/……等职业，会加很多很多人，所以需要把熟悉的人专门用一个微信管理？
因为不想让公司单位要求的文章点赞转发到朋友圈污染自己的朋友圈？
我感觉上面几点我都不是很需要，反倒是双开的缺点更阻止我。
1. 两个账户都需要接钱收钱，相当于多了一个微信钱包，增加了管理难度。更何况我还用记账软件记账呢，多一个账户就多一点麻烦。
2. 在 Mac 上登录两个微信的话，每天都要重新扫码登录一次，不像只有一个微信的时候 Mac 上的微信只要不关机就能一直挂着。
3. 工作和生活的界限往往不是那么明确，总有点模糊。例如，公司如果有篮球/羽毛球/乒乓球群，那就得用工作微信加。而且，如果有的同事以后变成了朋友关系，那么就得从二号微信转移到一号微信，得再加一遍好友。他会怎么想？聊天记录不在一起，怎么弄？以后想回顾、想搜索岂不是都比较麻烦。
4. 因为我主力机是 iPhone ，只能开一个微信，所以如果有的时候只带 iPhone 出门的话，安卓机上的微信消息我就看不到了。
但是吧，是否要双开微信就必须得提前规划，等工作以后真加了几个同事了，再想拆分成两个微信就麻烦了。所以想问下坛友，你们如果双开微信的话是因为什么呢？觉得是否满意？没双开的是否后悔把同事亲戚朋友混在一起了？]]></summary>

几个月前出差，在外地下载的时候一直被吸上传，刚开始还以为这里 p2p 连通性好所以连的人多，后来才发现是 pcdn 在吸血。当时正好是那个臭名昭著的 taipei torrent 客户端肆虐的时期，于是就网上抄了个 IP 黑名单文档导进下载器里，给屏蔽掉了。
结果上周又开始被 pcdn 吸血，一度被吸到 15MB/S 的上传。这次 pcdn 主要是显示为两个客户端，一个是 gopeed dev ，一个是比特彗星。其中伪造比特彗星的那个甚至连下载进度都能伪造，随着它的吸血，他的下载进度也是一直在涨的，然后涨到一定数值大概 95%左右就会短暂断连，然后过几秒同一个 IP 重新连上来，这次下载进度又掉到 0 然后重新开始涨。如果不注意的话很容易误把他当作正常的 BT 客户端。
而且这次遇到的吸血的 IP 都特别多，换的极其频繁，一个一个上，第一次遇上两三个 IP ，手动写进黑名单里屏蔽了，五分钟后又有两三个新 IP 连进来吸血，怎么都屏蔽不完。这两天总共算下来得手写了三四十个 IP 在黑名单里，烦死了]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[最近的项目需要用到人脸识别 Landmark 和 face mesh ，调研了市面上主流的 NN 框架：MNN, NCNN, TNN, MediaPipe;
MNN 阿里的，速度快，有个 MNNKit demo ，人脸关键点 106 个，单帧处理耗时在 3-5ms ；
TNN 腾讯基于 NCNN 做的速度优化版本，有个 demo ，270+关键点，识别速度，单帧 3-5ms ，缺点关键点有点抖动；
MediaPipe：谷歌开源的，有 473 点 face landmark ，在 iOS 平台识别速度 10-15ms 单帧；但安卓平台同配置手机 30-50ms ，CPU 占用也比 MNN 高 2-3 倍；
除了人脸识别，MediaPipe 还带了背景分割，头发分割等，缺点就是刚才说的性能可能有问题。MNN 的化只有一个人脸 106 点识别，没有其他官方 demo 。TNN 有快一年没更新了，所以不准备考虑。
本人刚接触深度学习，还不清楚如何训练模型和框架基础原理。MNN 和 MediaPipe 算是两个资料比较多的框架，准备从这个两个入手, 个人倾向 MediaPipe ，现成的 demo 功能比较多。
OK ，问题：
MediaPipe 的性能问题存在在哪里，是模型的问题还是框架的问题？
MNN 和 MediaPipe 推荐哪个，如果 MNN 做 face mesh ，有哪些快速可用的模型或代码？]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello!
I recently wanted to learn a bit about computer vision. Initially, I wanted to build something which could solve a jigsaw puzzle, but figured I should start with something (much) simpler, so I've built this instead.
This is a visual Sudoku solver which runs in the browser. It works by using OpenCV to identify and process the Sudoku grid, passing this to a simple ML model to identify the digits, and then solving the puzzle with a backtracking algorithm. The ML model was trained on the TMNIST data set using a model built with Keras, also a completely new area to me.
It's far from perfect, and doesn't like non perfectly lit or overly warped puzzles, but the main goal here was learning, which I did, a lot.
As this was primarily a learning project, I've tried to document my approach as much as possible, which can be found in this Python notebook:
https://github.com/Taiters/sudoku-solver/blob/main/notebooks...
I used Python while exploring OpenCV and training the models etc, and eventually ported this over to web (OpenCV.js + Tensorflow.js) to get something I could actually share with people.
Feel free to have a dig around the source or play around with the solver!

 However - there's a another "dark side" of my virtual life - and that is simracing. I have a whole separate gaming desktop, with strong dedicated gfx, simracing base, wheels, pedals, motion rigs etc. In one word - the simrig. 
 Has anyone ever tried to run a simrig under Linux? I mean, for example:
  
Fanatec base/wheel/pedals
 VRS, Simcube base/wheels/pedals
 VR headset
 simracing titles like rFactor2, iRacing, Autmobilista 2 etc.
  
Any luck there? 
 This seems like a heavy 'windowsed' gaming aspect of our computer life, right?

 I went on how surprised i am that everything works 2 days after installing Linux, now over 60 passed and well my initial amazement still holds.
 So i am running pop os, i game, i code and i play with local ai's
 Never once i ran into any problem with system itself or compatibility issue.
 Gaming cross platform on virtual lan? Works.
 Game performance? Equal or better in my case.
 I never expected to run into problems with python and i didnt visual studio works good too.
 Lm studio for local llms works a bit different and while on win it didnt see option for endless generation now
 it only generates endlessly and prompt itself which is weird but fine.
 a1111 and comfyui works flawlessly.
 Installing aps with command line is in my opinion actually less of hassle than uncheking million of ad boxes in standard win installators
 My only complain is that pop shop is a bit laggy but cosmic shop is there and works much better.
 In all my 60 days of using pop_os i only once needed to use my windows laptop and it was to play league of legends. And not playing league is in general good for mental health.
 So yeah I'm still amazed how different my current experience with linux is compared to 2016 or even 2019

所以我一直在想一个问题，怎样才是 Notion 正确的打开方式呢？
说到底每个人的笔记需求、以及笔记习惯都不一样，所以正确且唯一的答案大概率是不存在的。不过，排除错误概率更大的选项总是简单些。所以在正式进入 Notion 的栏目之前，我想先描绘一下，通常一个新手是怎么放弃使用 Notion 的。

第一次接触诛仙小说应该也是十几年前的事情，高一高二一度沉迷网络小说，一发不可收拾，断断续续的看了不少。惊叹于作者对于诛仙世界架构和故事逻辑，主副线也很完整，人物鲜活丰满，而且文笔也不错。最引人瞩目的当属主人公的感情纠葛，碧瑶的虽死不悔的爱，陆雪琪的温婉素雅和为了张小凡的付出都是让那时的我特别特别感动的，从当时来说，诛仙确实是非常可以带给人一种震撼的感觉的。
如今从动漫入局，又把原小说看了一遍，梦回青春年少的仙侠错觉，总有种说不清道不明的神奇滋味。]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've wasted too much time trying to resolve this thus I'm offering some tips for others:
  
On your iphone, go to Settings -> Photos -> "Transfer to Mac or PC" -> Keep Originals.
  
This is a key step. Without this step, the phone will keep disconnecting. On windows, if you do not select "Keep Originals", it will auto convert HEIC to JPG when importing using File Explorer or Photos App.
  
Mount your iphone via USB
  
There are many ways to do this and I can't remember how I did it. I don't have ifuse installed. Pair your computer to the phone. You might have to try different ports, different cables. lsusb to see if it's connected.
  
Install gthumb.
  
Log out, log back in. Gthumb is great because it will only import new photos on subsequent transfers.
  
Plug in your phone. On the phone, you will meet pop up boxes. "Trust" your computer and "allow" photo transfers.
  
That's it. Hope this helps.
 ps. Why HEIC? It's smaller than JPG. It's a hassle to work on, but it saves space.
 pss. I'm using a $3 iphone cable. but YMMV

This is a macOS app that allows you to see all your open windows on each monitor and select the one you want.
It also lets you view the current state of things like email or chat windows, terminal processes, and more.
You can use "cmd" and the key above the tab key for alt-tab like behaviour.
You can also toggle the UI by resting a finger on the corner of your trackpad.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[背景
我有一个静态库 A ，提供的头文件中有 public 的结构体和方法接口，以供别人调用
namespace api {

struct MyStruct {
    std::string text;
    int text_length;
};

std::string getStructInfo(const MyStruct &struct);

}


另一个静态库 B ，依赖了静态库 A ，其源码内实例化了一个 MyStruct 结构体对象，并调用了 getStructSize 方法获取了结果
静态库 A 和静态库 B 均以 二进制.a 形式集成到工程 App 中使用
问题
某一天，静态库 A 中的头文件 MyStruct 定义发生变化:
struct MyStruct {
    int text_length;
    float score;
    std::string full_text;
};

我想在不重新构建静态库 B ，保持 MyStruct 命名不变，使用新定义的情况下，通过指针偏移或二进制适配手段，使静态库 B 内的代码逻辑能正常运行，应该如何进行处理？
我的想法是，由于 getStructSize 的参数是引用，所以打算通过上测算出老的结构体定义的大小，然后 memcpy 对应长度的 buffer 到一个和原结构体定义完全一致，但命名空间不一致的的结构体中，随后进行提取：
第一步：定义一个结构体，和原来的 MyStruct 完全一致，但通过命名空间隔离:
namespace old {

struct MyStruct {
    std::string text;
    int text_length;
};

}

第二步：在 getStructInfo 内部，进行转换
int getStructInfo(const MyStruct &struct) {
    size_t old_size = sizeof(old::MyStruct);
    old::MyStruct old_struct;
    memcpy(&old_struct, &struct, old_size);

    printf("old struct text:%s", old_struct.text.c_str());
    ……
}

总觉得这个方法是可以的，但实际操作的过程中就不行，无法获得 text 的值，这是为什么呢？求大神赐教下

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[今天随手用手机测个速，发现有点问题：
200M 宽带，家中网络链路正常，虽然主路由是 esxi 里的 openwrt ，但性能没任何问题。宽带速率 200M 。
    如果用电脑有线测试，使用电信官方的测速平台：10000.gd.cn ，测得结果约 360M ，正常并且有余。用内网的 speedtest 服务器测，无限接近 1000M ，看来内外网有线链路没问题。
    用手机（ iphone 14 pro ios:17.5.1 ） wifi 测试内网，下载速率 800M 左右，稳定。分别使用 Ruckus R730 （ wifi6 8*8:8 ），Aruba AP-534(wifi6 4*4:4)测试，结果接近。
    而用手机打开 10000.gd.cn 测速，多次结果都在 120M-130M 左右。
    手机、路由均关闭梯子，路由重启过。
    同样位置、信号强度，测试内网速度，可达 800M 。
    试了⼀晚无法理解，求助。]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[虚拟卡平台很多 fomepay 、fomecard （一家的）、dupay 、vvacard 等等
为了避免再次掉入类似 Fomepay 的骗局，选择合规的实体公司、合规的服务非常重要。
我总结了一些分辨靠谱合规的公司、服务的方法：
小心支持 USDT 的平台：真正合规的支付公司，是无法支持 USDT 的，USDT 这类虚拟稳定币，因为其匿名使用的特性，在国内是无法合规的。支持 USDT 的平台，跑路的概率极大。FomePay 就是支持 USDT 的。
小心自称虚拟卡的平台：国内监管机构并不承认虚拟卡作为正规业务展业的，目前正规的海外支付通道，是不会直接用虚拟卡这种称谓的。
是否要求实名：支持海外支付，是需要换汇报备的，要求实名的平台，才正规。反而一开始就要跑路的公司才不会在意什么实名。
存续时间：不要选择刚上线的小平台，尤其是一看上去就是统一跟 FomePay 一个模样的网站，估计背后都是同样的一群人，同样一套代码换个皮继续做。
联系客服：尝试与客服沟通，合规的公司客服一般都能提供及时有效的反馈。
目前用下来 wildcard 挺不错，审美在线，关键是金额随时可以提现！！！
如果需要的话，可以参考下这篇文章： https://chatgptzh.com.cn/fomepay-run/]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[今晚肝代码，一个新的开源项目，新鲜出炉，给大家介绍一下。
首先放上代码仓库： https://github.com/daqing/goargs
这个项目是做什么的呢？
就是取代一个 Unix 命令：xargs
所以我的项目就叫：goargs，因为是用 go 写的
goargs 的用法，类似于 xargs
那么，goargs 有什么优势呢？
就是支持复杂的参数组合，举个例子：
$ echo foo bar | goargs echo :2 :1
这样会输出：bar foo
这样你可能大体理解了 goargs 的用法
再举一个例子：
假设当前目录有 2 个 go 文件：
a.go
b.go

那么，如何批量把这两个文件，重命名为
a.go.py
b.go.py

呢？
使用 goargs 就可以做到：
看命令：
ls *.go | goargs mv :1 :1.py
所以 goargs 的设计是非常灵活的，可以帮助你实现非常复杂的批处理场景，具体用法等你来挖掘。

现在在火车上，从家乡往南走的这条路上网络信号一直不太好，总是会没网，所以通常我也会下点单机游戏或者电影之类的在路上打发时间，今天正好把这一篇一直想写的博客写了，不过依旧是，在构思的时候总会想到很多，但是手放在键盘上准备写的时候又似乎开始词穷。
在乡下呆了差不多一个月，感触还是比较深的，最深的就是，一些以前经常见的“大人”变老了，身体也越来越不好了，也包括我的父母。还有就是一些以前见过的小朋友现在都已经成了大孩子了，隔壁家的小女孩记得我上次见的时候似乎还是幼儿园，如今已经是一个亭亭玉立的初中生了。每天晚上九点以后我就会去我家附近的篮球场打篮球，在那里遇到不少以前的朋友，还有一些小朋友，打球的时候我说的最多的话就是“XXX 我上次见的时候还那么小，现在都能和我一起打篮球了…”。
故人
如同我的感叹一样，许多“大人”看到我之后都会惊叹一声“你都长这么高了，是不是大学快毕业了都？”，而对于年龄跟我差不多的或者比我没小几岁的那些总是说我一点都没变🤣
而这次回来另一件对我来说意义比较大的见面的是回乡前一天与我的初恋见面了，在我回来之前她跟我说，一晃我们认识都九年了，第一次相遇的时候我才上初中一年级，那时候什么都不懂，但是心里却很清楚，我确实是真心喜欢她，而如今年龄大了似乎懂得多了，但是却逐渐也不知道真正的喜欢是什么样的了。跟初恋吃了顿饭，饭后也一起在河边散步，如同两个很久未见的老友一样我们聊了很多，聊对未来的打算，聊这些年都变化，聊身边的朋友…实际上我们俩上次见面还是我们高中二年级的时候，至今也已经近五年了，那个时候我还是个莽撞暴躁的少年，她也是个年少气盛的少女，没想到转眼间五年后再见会是这样的场景。见面之前她跟我说，见面后会不会尴尬？她要是说不出来怎么办？很显然她多虑了，我们从下午滔滔不绝的聊到晚上，简直像…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[老铁们好，最近上线了个 iOS App《有所思》
链接：https://apps.apple.com/cn/app/%E6%9C%89%E6%89%80%E6%80%9D/id6472561814
App 是内容类的，App 本身没什么复杂的，是以内容为主
App 的副标题：以问题激发思考，重新认识自己与世界
App 的主旨有两个：“我”和“思考”
“我”：认识自己，站在自己的立场以自己的视角来看待世界。自己和世界是一个整体，对自己的认识和对世界的认识是相辅相成相互促进的。
“思考”：信息时代，铺天盖地的信息，“我”看到了“我”就有提升了吗？有所思才可能会有所得。
从我自己的感受来说，很多时候，自己想思考点什么，却不知从何处开始。
所以才有了做这么个 App 的想法，以问题作为引导，激发读者思考记录自己的所思所想。
问题大致分为两类：
每日一问：每天一个新问题，可能会觉得太少了，我想的是我这个问题仅仅是抛砖引玉，希望能激发读者深度思考并提出更多自己的问题。比如：
你想要一位真正的人生导师吗？
既有大视野大格局，又能耳提面命细致入微地教导。
但是，真的会有这样如师如父的人吗？
如果没有，我们要如何自渡？
日常问题：每天或每周不同时段都会出现的问题，可能会有点无聊，但是我觉得比新问题还要重要，毕竟人生是靠日常积累起来的。比如晚上八点到九点半的日常问题：
今天表现怎么样啊？
最少找出五件自己满意的地方，无论多细小
最多找出三件自己表现不够的地方，没想到就算了
记录下来呗~
感觉 V2EX 上的老铁都不错，想着在这宣传下自己的产品。
如果老铁们愿意下载试用再给点真实使用的评价就太感谢了。
从后台数据看，大多数用户基本只打开过一次，我猜可能有两个原因：
没什么内容，我预想的是用户每天打开看几次，慢慢就积累下来属于“我”的内容，就像人生一样的一点一点地积累。
日常问题设置的是到指定时段才会出现，这么个不起眼的小 App ，用户想不起来。
所以想问问大家有啥优化建议不。]]></summary>

 So I just decided to try Debian for the first time, I'm currently using Debian 12 + Gnome and it's awesome, the system didn't crashed a single time, everything ACTUALLY just works, and the system seems pretty reliable overall.

 What I'm noticing, on Linux MInt, is that reviews seem to be missing/culled from the database. Can I enable these reviews that are mysteriously missing? Seriously, if distro maintainers want app feedback to be relevant to their users, just give us a filter to sort by Mint users!

前提：
0️⃣各种原因没法自己跑到日本去搞； 1️⃣不考虑金钱和时间成本；
想法：
直接到日本 Apple 官网下单，收件地址写转运公司日本收货仓库，然后通过转运公司从日本转运回国、过海关最后送到我手里；
疑问：
0️⃣这种想法可行吗？ 1️⃣入境清关时候如果被海关查到（对海关不太懂，据说是抽查，有不被查到的可能）结果是补缴税款然后放行过关还是直接扣押永远到不了我手里（主要是不懂海关政策：外区 iPhone 这样的商品是否可以合法入境）？ 2️⃣各家转运公司几乎都有香港仓库，在日本 Apple 官网下单时候收件地址是否可以直接写香港仓库（日本 Apple 是否可以直接将商品送到香港）？
顺便问下：
如果以上可行，同理是不是可以很容易买到所有转运公司业务覆盖地区的 iPhone 、iPad 、Mac ？]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Whenever I see people talk about the reasons they started using Linux, they usually mention a strong dislike of Microsoft, features that they prefer, certain aspects they find more elegant, customizability. For me, I use Linux almost entirely because I think it's really fun to use.
 I've been daily driving linux for about two years now and I'm always trying new distros, desktop environments, apps, etc. I've used everything from Pop!_OS to core Arch because I love trying new things with my computer.
 I love how modular Linux is, I can do pretty much whatever I want, decorate my desktop with whatever themes I want. One time I replaced all icons in my DE with the Windows vista icons, just because I could!
 There are technically some things that windows is better for, like gaming or graphic design, but I just haven't enjoyed interacting with the operating system since Windows 8, when they made everything flat and ugly and took away the search bar. I've had problems with every major iteration since then. In contrast, my kde desktop is very cute, and will only change should I choose to change it, and it makes it feel a lot more personal, like my computer changes to suit my wants and needs instead of the other way around.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Greetings
 I have tried building a low-powered HTPC for watching YouTube and movies, and Ubuntu is my usual choice.
 My problem is that manufacturers lie. They claim that this or that CPU with built-in graphics manages 4K@60Hz video, but I keep getting burned.
 It is possible that they work in Windows - it could be driver related with regards to encoders - but in Linux I invariably get stutter, artifacts, downsampling and such.
 A Raspberry Pi does not suffice. A Celeron J1800 does not suffice. An Intel N100 does not suffice. An Athlon 200GE does not suffice. A Ryzen 4350GE does not quite suffice.
 The only time it worked well was when I put a GTX960 in the box, but the idea is to have something that does not constantly burn 100 W below the TV.
 So I wonder if there is any smarter way to go by this than "buy stuff, see if it works".
 I wonder if you can recommend some tool, such as a video decoding benchmark?
 I find plenty of encoding such, and I find some that are for decoding but only in Windows or MacOS. Only works with NVDEC or such caveats.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[在 2019-2020 年初三期间接触到了翻墙，一直想写一个翻墙软件，但是当时什么也不会
后来高中自己学了点 go 语言，虽然知道了其中的法律风险，梦想早已放弃，但是前几天突然又记起来了，贼心不死，虽然并不打算搞这个，但是还是想实现一个带加密的 socks5 代理服务器，遇到一些问题，故来请教 V 友们
PS：我只是为了缅怀一下曾经的梦想，没有任何非法的打算!!!
依照 你也能写个 Shadowsocks 这个教程，主要分为两端：
本地：将浏览器流量转发至服务器端
服务器端：完成和浏览器之间的 socks5 握手，解析出目标服务器，并转发流量至目标服务器
实现流量转发的关键代码：
	go CopyData(srcConn, dstConn, cipher)
	CopyData(dstConn, srcConn, cipher)

其中这个 CopyData 几乎完全按照标准库的 io.Copy 实现，只是加了一层加解密，长这样：
func CopyData(srcConn, dstConn net.Conn, cipher Cipher) (err error) {
	buf := make([]byte, 32*1024)
	for {
		nr, er := srcConn.Read(buf)
		if nr > 0 {
			nw, ew := dstConn.Write(cipher.Encrypt(buf[0:nr]))
			//fmt.Println("内容：", cipher.Encrypt(buf[0:nr]))
			//time.Sleep(1 * time.Nanosecond)
			if nw < 0 || nr < nw {
				nw = 0
				if ew == nil {
					ew = errors.New("short write")
				}
			}

			if ew != nil {
				err = ew
				break
			}
			if nr != nw {
				err = io.ErrShortWrite
				break
			}
		}
		if er != nil {
			if er != io.EOF {
				err = er
			}
			break
		}
	}
	fmt.Println("CopyData err:", err)
	return err
}

问题来了，只要我把 fmt.Println("内容：", cipher.Encrypt(buf[0:nr])) 注释掉，程序就不能运行起来（不会报错），一旦取消注释，程序就能如预期一样运行 QAQ
然后我想了一下，可能是这行代码起到了延时的作用，于是我把它改成 time.Sleep(1 * time.Nanosecond) 发现依然可以正常运行，但是一旦注释掉就不能正常进行流量转发了，想请问一下是为什么 QAQ
我可以补充任何大家需要的详细信息]]></summary>

There are enterprise distributions like RHEL or SLED, but as an individual I don't need all the enterprise stuff. Just my workstations to work. There's also Ubuntu Pro and some others like elementaryOS, PopOS, Zorin OS or older ones like Xandros or Linspire, but they all run gnome or some custom stuff.
 Is there any paid KDE distribution that just provides packages & security patches for some stable LTS version like KDE5? Whom do I have to give money for this?

联想到新国标对于电动自行车的相关标准，突然就觉得好像不太合理
短途出行还是两轮的交通工具比较合适，
如果要两个成年人一起去办点事，不得开两辆车才不违反交通规则？
好像没几个人的电自速度是限制的 25km/h ，看外卖小哥跑得比汽车还快
按照新国标的电池和电机功率标准，车子的续航也注定不可能太长
大家上牌的时候为了过审，都会在商家那里换一个小一点的电池去上牌，上完立马换回大电池
所以这个新国标是不是太过严格一点，以至于根本就没起到什么实质性的作用；
此外最近很多地方有电子眼抓拍电瓶车违章，大家为了防止被拍，很多人都在车牌上挂了个口罩，或者毛巾。。
那这个电子眼抓拍是不是也没起到多大的约束作用？]]></summary>

        <id>https://www.v2ex.com/t/1065956#reply1</id>
        <link href="https://www.v2ex.com/t/1065956#reply1"/>
        <updated>2024-08-18T15:40:20.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[起因
自七月开始，手机开始陆续收到一些短信、贷款的推销短信。
到了八月初，首先是接到了一个电话，声称我有一笔 “医疗补充金” 待领取。这种话术一听就是推销 or 诈骗，直接就挂断掉了。这个时候也没有特别关心，只是觉得推销越来越多了。
之后的节奏就开始疯狂起来了，他们使用不同的短信签名发送内容大致相同但推广链接不同的短信。一会是信用飞、好分期、众安金融这些短信，一会又是通过不同的手机号码（非固定电话，全部是个人号码，但都是虚拟运营商）进行骚扰。以近乎每日一条甚至两三条的频率疯狂推送短信，电话则是每周能接到两到三次。
我的号码会在工作中使用，短信尚且可以编辑规则屏蔽，但电话无能为力。来电的号码归属地哪里都有，除了都是虚拟运营商外，没有其他规律。
端倪
虽然短信签名不同，但他们使用的短链接大多相似。比如他们使用的一部分域名：
kg1.cn
gh1.cn
qw7.cn
8rf.cn
这些域名都在近期内完成了 ICP 备案，并且来自不同的主体，大概是收购来的备案或域名。
而贷款短信中的链接点进去会直接跳转到正规的小贷平台，跳转携带了 aff 链接。这些小贷平台会结算佣金，但不知道这条代理链条有多长，也拿不到相关的资料。
无独有偶，在“医疗补充金”的骚扰电话来电后，也会收到一条签名为 “保单在线” 的企业所发的短信，使用的链接同样是与上述短信相同的 xxx.cn 格式。这个所谓的 “医疗补充金” 和 “保单在线” 其实已经被许多组织预警，可以查询到很多关于他们的信息。你点进他们的链接订阅了他们的产品后，他们会划走高额的订阅费用，大概率是针对不会操作取消订阅的群体。
如图：
滥发 106 短信，电话语音诱导诈骗别人订阅产品，听起来比较老的手段，今天仍然还在。
最后
其实在今天，骚扰短信和电话早就算是一件小事。我们的数据、信息早已被链条上的既得利益者传的满天飞。但见到这种程度的骚扰，终究还是令我比较担忧。
我们作为每天耳濡目染这些圈套的人，也只能堪堪应对。很难想他们通过这些手段欺骗了多少不懂退订的中老年人。可能像是我的父母一样，上了年纪也不会操作，只能吃了哑巴亏。
即便最后发现并通过种种方式退订，早就不知道被划走了多少隐性费用，但又够不上报警的条件。这种事情更不会告诉在外工作的子女，就这样被骗走少则几十多则几百上千的费用。
个人的力量终归太有限，我很希望能深挖这条灰色链条，但又苦于没有时间、精力，也没有足够的手段制裁。能做到这些多多少少依赖着灰产。很多材料还能深挖出一些蛛丝马迹。但真的，个人的力量太弱小了。
很无奈，但我能做的也只是把他发出来。]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[如果一个人没上班或者处在下班后的时间，你跟他说，猪肉一块钱十斤，他肯定会觉得要么你疯了要么商家疯了，因为他的理智告诉他，几乎不可能有这么卖猪肉的。
但是，一旦类似的情况发生在公司，情况完全就变了。
我们以熟悉的互联网公司为例。比如面试，我们都知道技术注重的是实操，但是很多公司就是喜欢面八股文，不注重实操。再比如加班，明明没什么事做，早点下班休息，第二天精神饱满才能更好干活，但是公司就是不让走，哪怕坐着玩手机都行。
这些事情，在任何有理智的个人看来，都是很无语的行为，但是公司就要这么做。为什么呢？
如果我们把视角拉高一点，从整个社会的视角看，把公司当作劳改所，把员工当作犯人。这样一来所有的事情就变得合理了，员工进来就是有罪的，而公司的义务就是把“犯人”好好改造。
公司说猪肉一块钱十斤，你说不对，那就“打”，“打”到你同意为止。（“打”表现为降薪、扣绩效、辞退）
公司说你活着全靠老板赏你饭吃，你反驳说你凭自己的能力挣钱吃饭，还是“打”，必须得把你这种“病态”的价值观“矫正”过来。
当你活干得好的时候，就给你改善下“伙食”（加薪、奖金），当你没干好的时候，迎接你的就是“打骂”。
所以，我不禁想到：在公司这座“劳改所”里，与其说员工是在赚钱，不如说是在接受劳改。改造的不能有自己的理性思考，改造的要默默为资本家服务。
所以公司，不是单纯的经济实体，而是资本控制人们思想的统治工具。
PS：只是随便聊聊一些看法，有不同意见欢迎评论理性探讨。]]></summary>

关于中国产品研发团队
中国团队的业务是服务于全球客户的，团队规模目前在 150 人左右，直接汇报给荷兰总部，跟总部的技术团队有着密切的协作。工作语言是英语，所以即使是工程师的职位，也会要求英文日常会话的能力。
组织架构和协作方式大致可以从以下两个方面展开：
跨区域团队合作
目前协作的方式是按照主题来展开的，每个项目组都有各自的小主题。通常一个大的主题下面会分成 3 到 5 个小的主题（每个小的主题对应一个 6-10 人的敏捷开发小组，小组内有开发，测试，产品经理，设计师等）。目前的现状是，国内有一个完整的大的主题，这部分团队的自主性就非常高，总部的干预很少。还…]]></summary>

我在家里的手机上和电脑上，配置 DNS 为：192.168.1.2 ，223.5.5.5
我的想法是：任何 DNS 查询，首先到 192.168.1.2 ，如果是查询 123.test.com ，则应答，如果是其它域名，则不应答，由下一个 223.5.5.5 去应答。因此我在 192.168.1.2 上不启用剃归解析
4.结果是：nslookup 123.test.com 192.168.1.2 时，正常应答，但是，nslookup 123.test.com 时，无法正常解析 123.test.com. ping 123.test.com 也不行。

通讯：内有邮箱、通讯等不到十个标签；
人工智能：内有各家工具十多个标签；
工具：内有几个工具页面；
现状：
如果重启电脑或意外关闭浏览器窗口或断电开机，则能通过恢复标签或历史记录里的提示按钮一次性恢复浏览器窗口。
如果同时打开多个浏览器窗口，又恰巧不小心关闭了主浏览器窗口，则无法一次性恢复这个窗口，甚至连历史记录里也没有恢复选项卡组的功能。
可以手工一个一个把标签页添加到浏览器收藏夹的指定文件夹内，但是慢（虽然实际多花不了几分钟）。
待解决问题：

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[三星的配置参数 :
4K OLED 144Hz, 800-1000 尼特, 8ms 响应, 99%色域, 四核 A72+3GB RAM+32GB 存储, 40W 音响 x4, 97%屏占比, USB2.0x2, HDMI2.1x4, 功耗 290W. 支持 VRR/ALLM/HDR10+/eARC/MEMC 等, 但是只有杜比全景声, 没有杜比视界, 三星没有电视支持杜比视界, 没有标记是否有 QFT/QMS
蓝牙是 5.2, Wi-Fi5
索尼的配置参数 :
4K miniLED 120Hz, 2000-3000 尼特, 7ms 响应, 95%色域, 四核 A73+6GB RAM+32G 存储, 32w 音响 x4, 95%屏占比, USB2.0x1+USB3.0x1+HDMI2.0x2+HDMI2.1x4, 功耗 219W. 支持 VRR/ALLM/HDR10+/eARC/MEMC 等, 有杜比视界, 没有标记是否有 QFT/QMS
蓝牙是 5.3, Wi-Fi6
两者京东价位都是一万级别, 淘宝上差价 2000. 不过索尼 OLED 版本 XR80, 要加 3000, 音响多一个, 色域和三星持平, 亮度 1500-2000 尼特, 功耗增加至 340W, 其它差不多. 保修都是一年, 主要部件三年
网上得到的信息是, 索尼电视国内是特供版本, 三星不清楚. 大家都说索尼硬件差, 但是这么一比看起来也不差?
个人的情况是播放的电影和电视剧基本上都是尽量高品质, 有原盘上原盘. 偶尔有 iOS/macOS 投屏, 现在的小米画面声音都延迟非常高. 不播放电影和电视剧基本上都放运营商的宽带电视直播, 人在家电视从早到晚都开. 有油管需求, 奈飞是潜在需求, 应该没有玩游戏投屏需求, 有也是 switch, 之后大概率会加一个 Apple TV
另外, 购买前要不要去线下比较一下?]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[之所以称作木板 1365U （ ES ），是因为包裹主板的壳子是很轻的木头，整机重量只有 230 克。主板来自 yogabook 9i ，某大佬魔改出来的杰作，插电正常运行。（ 30cm 10cm 1.5cm ）
收到的价格是 880 ，木板+1365U+AX211+16G 内存。然后自己随便插了块 256 固态，摸了个 130W 的充电器。
 
CPU-Z 多核 4578 （ 42W ），单核 664 ，甚至比不上满功耗的 1235U 。。。[https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1Mg41197oa/]
 
有三个雷电四接口，这是最值钱的。其中一个接口分给 PD 电源，65~100W 就足够了，测过多核满载整机功耗在 64W 左右，65W 的 pd 可能满足不了 U 。
另外两个雷电四玩法就多了。首先我认为未来一定是雷电四的天下，USB4 由于信号是否实现完全看厂家脸色，很多时候纯碰运气，还是有标准规范的雷电四更安心。其次，雷电四可以扩展任何常见外设，只要买到合适的扩展坞就行。市面上有带 100W PD 输入的扩展坞，上面还带有其他接口，和木板 1365U 结合的话就只需要占用一个雷电四，同时还实现了数据和供电，相当完美。
不过我最看重的还是雷电网桥。经过简单测试，尽管雷电网桥可以工作在 20Gpbs 速率，但 smb 和 http 协议都跑不满 10Gbps ，只有 iperf 多线程可以跑满，看是否有办法优化下。我主要想利用雷电网桥，把目前的 nas 服务器搬到这个木板 1365U 上，和工作的主机结成 20Gbps 的点对点网络，速度直接起飞。
 
说到 nas ，目前的想法也有所转变。不再需要带 sata 的主板，而是用 10Gbps 的外置硬盘柜，通过 c 口连接到 1365U 上，就避免了一定要买 sata 口主板的问题。这就有点像拼乐高，只要你有 c 口雷电口，咱们就是好兄弟。
顺便跑下鲁大师，显卡外接的，独占一个 c 口。

 附上之前的 nas：
 12300T+32G+AX201+2.5G 有线，有点想在 1050 左右的价格出了，只是怪可爱的。]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[国内很多 TLS/SSL 证书服务商，都是服务商自己又生成私钥，又生成公钥证书，然后让你下载。
美其名曰操作简便！
而正规 TLS/SSL 证书生成流程，早在 Win2000 Server 时代自带的“证书”服务就演示清楚了
当时在 Win2000 中，是由 IE 浏览器（需要 ActiveX 控件）在浏览器中本地生成证书私钥和 CSR ，然后 IE 将 CSR 提交到“证书”服务，服务端颁发证书后，再由 IE 下载回来并与本地私钥合并。最终用户可以得到可导出的 p12 文件。
自始至终“证书”服务都没有接触过用户私钥匙。
而今很多用户对某些证书服务商掌握客户证书私钥默认觉得应该就是这样，不免有些感叹！

另外说下 acme.sh 这点还是做的不错的，它就是本地生成私钥，通过 CSR 提交给服务商的，服务商是不掌握用户私钥的。]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello everyone! I've been working on this little tool called TreeGen, and I’m excited to finally share it with you all!
 It's a command-line tool that lets you turn an ASCII tree into an actual file and folder structure. Super handy for DevOps tasks, quickly setting up project files and folders, or replicating complex hierarchies with ease.
 $ treegen tree_structure.txt $ cat tree_structure.txt | treegen $ treegen < tree_structure.txt $ treegen <<-EOF /path/to/project/ |-- src/ | +-- main.js |-- LICENSE.md +-- README.md EOF 
  
NOTE: The default box-drawing characters are too supported.
  
If this sounds like something you’d find useful, check it out on GitHub and see how it can streamline your workflow. Feedback, ideas, or even just a star would mean a lot!
 P.S. If anyone would like to help to include this into the official Fedora/Debian/Ubuntu/etc. repositories, I'd appreciate that.

看文档提示 MacBookPro11,3 显卡驱动有问题，正好我就是这个型号，首次启动需要进安全模式，运行完 Post-Installation 就好了，中间几次会卡死，直接强制关机再安装貌似也没事，然后如果抹盘再安装貌似不会卡住。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[前段时间我的公网 IP 掉了，也引起了大伙的讨论。我懒得跟运营商继续扯皮，所以想自己折腾折腾，用打洞的方式连回家。
首先要感谢 @mikewang @heiher @gdy666 几位大佬提供的 TCP 打洞的程序，不然我可能就只能选择 frp 之类中转的方案了，个人还是比较倾向于直连。
家里 HTTP 的服务通过 302 跳转访问，基本没什么痛点。SSH 连接借鉴的的是 natmap 项目中提出的方案——使用 NATMap 在 NAT-1 私网 IP 宽带上部署 SSH 服务，但是我选择将端口信息保存到 TXT 记录中，个人觉得更方便一点。
唯一比较难受的是，以前有公网 IP 的时候，可以直接用 VPN 连回家里，这样干活（摸鱼）能方便点，但是公网 IP 掉了以后，我就没办法连回家里内网了。
一开始我是想找有没有类似实现的 VPN ，但似乎没找到，因为我原来用的就是 OpenVPN ，服务端是 Mikrotik 自带的，索性就尝试魔改了一下 OpenVPN 客户端，调研后我选择魔改 OpenVPN 3 这个库，看起来挺多 UI 客户端都依赖这个库。
我修改的方法大概是这样的，需要 ovpn 配置文件中添加一行记录
remote-srv _openvpn._tcp.yourdomain.com

OpenVPN 3 启动时需要读取 ovpn 配置，如果发现有remote-srv字段的配置，就会尝试解析 SRV 记录，获取到对应的端口号后，自动覆盖掉端口号的配置。
由于要解析 SRV 记录，所以引入了 ldns 库，现在想想，可能利用 IP4P 格式的记录做解析可能更方便，还不用引入其他库，不过我都写完了才想起来，就懒得改了
本身这是一个核心库，但是它本身带了一个 cli 程序，编译完后用 cli 命令连接即可，我偷懒就没弄 GUI 了（我是废物
这个图是我在公司网络用 cli 连回 Mikrotik 管理页面的截图 
仓库地址在这，欢迎大佬尝试使用，如果 readme 写的不清晰或者有问题，也欢迎提 issue： https://github.com/jdjingdian/openvpn3_srv]]></summary>

npm i concurrently tsx mysql2

现在创建 xxx.ts 或者 xxx.js：
import { Charsets } from 'mysql2'
// 从 mysql2 里面任意导入一个对象
console.log(Charsets == null)

发生了如下现象：
[正常]    运行 tsx xxx.ts，正常输出 false
[正常]    运行 tsx watch xxx.ts，正常输出 false
[正常]    运行 concurrently "tsx xxx.ts"，正常输出 [0] false
[错误]    运行 concurrently "tsx watch xxx.ts"，卡死了，无任何输出
也就是说，concurrently + tsx watch + mysql2 == 卡死？
有没有大佬知道这是怎么回事的。
非常好复现的 Bug ，请看小视频演示： https://files.imdodo.com/dodo/b1c472301aaff11ad9966242d9e5aac4.mp4
翻了下 concurrently 的官方文档，发现启用 --raw 参数，输出原始的打印内容，就不会卡住。
所以应该是 tsx watch 模式下，并且是以任意方式导入了 mysql2 这个包，tsx 就会输出某些让 concurrently 无法解析并令其卡住的内容。
所以，大佬们觉得，这到底是什么原理，真的很迷糊。]]></summary>

 And on the other hand a lot of goodies shipping to linux "overall generic improvements for UX", like better / easier configuration that doesn't require long sessions with terminal, better drivers support (out of the box running good) and gaming performance that actually makes gaming a thing. I see that people starts to give linux a try, on my close circle, nontech people started to ask me about what could they miss switching to linux, and if it's worth it. Also checking YouTube lately I see insane amount of videos being "let's try X distro" or "1 month with linux challenge" (thats actually leaves linux in good spot). do you think that the desktop scene could get more love soon / actually become an option for regular user to give it a try ditching other OS options, and impact on the marketshare?
 At least for me it was a constant try-on and out of distros for several years, but with the latest changes (especially for privacy concerns), if nothing breaks within my OS for the next 6 months, I'd go full linux in 2025 (having all webdev tools available on my setup). Looking forward for your thoughts, and what you think is the missing piece / limitation that could enable a flow of newcomers to the system ;-)

 Not just that, but if understood it right, it seems Flatpak runs your app in a isolated environment, which means, some settings might not be inherited from your own OS. Ex.: I've installed Thunderbird via Flatpak, every time my mouse cursor hovered on the app, its theme changed to the default one, instead of my OS theme (that's kind of annoying).
 I see their moto are "The future of apps on Linux", I really don't think so.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am investigating an issue, that I can not connect to docker containers via exposed ports to 80 or 8080 on a newly installed Linux Ubuntu 22 machine. Instead, every request hangs.
 So I rebooted the machine and stopped all services like nginx and docker. Nothing is listening on specific ports.
 `curl http://0.0.0.0:8000\`:
 as expected, it prints
  
curl: (7) Failed to connect to 0.0.0.0 port 8000 after 0 ms:
 Connection refused
  
However, `curl http://localhost:8000` causes curl to hang forever.
 When I do `ping localhost`, it shows it resolves to 127.0.0.1 (as expected)
 And `curl http://127.0.0.1:8000\` also failes to connect:
  
curl: (7) Failed to connect to 127.0.0.1 port 8000 after 0 ms:
 Connection refused
  
`netstat -l -p`

         现在有一个域名： https://a.cn ，我在公网服务器启动了 docker 、可能有三四个服务、
想法：
          我的想法是通过域名+url 、比如 a.cn/app1 、来取代 ip+端口的形式、比如 11.11.32.233:8000 、
实际问题：
          可能有很多 url 、完全 url 代理不完、比如 static 、其实用的是 docker 容器中的目录
场景展现：
           用 nginx 代理后 location app1/｛ 11.11.32.232:8000/｝、这种方式定义后、并不怎么好用、因为会先返回 html 、html 中包含 static 路径、比如/static/res.img ， 但因为我实际代理了、所以应该是/app1/static/res.img 、 这种情况有很多、难道要一个个进行代理么、然后回写替代 url ，
疑惑：
          这种情况下有什么简单方式可以直接用 url 轻松代理 ip+端口么、大家都没遇到过么]]></summary>

刚入手了一台M3 MacBook Air，在家里学习和办公的时候想连接到显示器上使用。家里有一台 2560*1080 的 27 寸带鱼屏，上面有一个 USBC 口，但我买好 USB4 的线缆后发现，这个显示器竟然不支持 USBC 的输入，在不想买拓展坞和希望支持显示器反向充电以及 HIDPI 开启的情况下，我的显示器该淘汰了。
调查
最近在刷显示器的时候，知道要么买 2K 显示器要么买 5K 显示器才能完美利用 HIDPI 的情况下，了解到了两个系列显示
Kuycon:
    - Kuycon G27X
    - Kuycon G27P

RichVision:
    - RichVision RV100
    - RichVision RV200Pro 

选择
数据经过左右互比后，感觉 RV200Pro 不错，但是不知道他的音响效果怎么样。这两个牌子都是以前没听说过的小众品牌，所以还是要问问大家的意见。]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[福建省宁德市通报，一男子四年前“翻墙”浏览境外网站，被予以行政处罚。宁德网警提醒说，只要有过“翻墙”行为，就会留下痕迹，不管目的是什么，学习知识也好，查阅资料也罢，甚至是什么都没有浏览，只要“翻墙”就违法违纪。


据湖北经视旗下栏目“经视直播”星期五（8月16日）报道，宁德网警近日发布通报，寿宁县公安局网安大队8月7日联合国保大队，成功查处一起擅自接入非法信道进行国际联网、浏览境外媒体资讯、不利于国家安全的行政案件，抓获违法行为人龚某某，斩断了境外不实资讯倒灌国内的通路。


通报说，今年7月初，民警在日常工作中发现群众龚某某于2020年有非法浏览境外网站的行为，掌握情况后，民警传唤龚某某至寿宁县公安局接受调查。经查，龚某某确有通过“翻墙”软件非法浏览境外网站及信息的行为，且对其非法浏览境外网站及信息的行为供认不讳。


根据《中华人民共和国计算机信息网络国际联网管理暂行规定》第十四条、第六条之规定，寿宁县公安局依法对龚某某处以行政处罚。


民警提醒，互联网不是法外之地。很多境外网站会存在一些宣传封建迷信、淫秽色情、血腥暴力等不良信息，广大网民应当用好网络平台，规范网络言行，文明、绿色上网，共同营造风清气正的网络空间。


宁德网警还指出，中国《计算机信息网络国际联网管理暂行规定》明确，计算机信息网络直接进行国际联网，必须使用邮电部国家公用电信网提供的国际出入口信道。任何单位和个人不得自行建立或者使用其它信道进行国际联网。如违反规定，由公安机关责令停止联网，给予警告，可以并处1万5000元人民币以下的罚款。


宁德网警提醒说，只要有过“翻墙”行为，就会留下痕迹，不管目的是什么，学习知识也好，查阅资料也罢，甚至是什么都没有浏览，只要“翻墙”就违法违纪。

Vmware WorkStation
需求是模拟个 win 玩点小单机或者在必要的时候用用吧，其实手搓 KVM 应该挺好的，可惜不会.....Cockpit 的虚拟机还是不算太完善。
Vbox 轻量功能少，不知道日常够不够用。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[市面上大家普遍认为，移动的 4G/5G 蜂窝网络是三家中最佳，而家宽中移动是相对较差的。
这一点可以从资费上发现，以物联网卡为例，移动 3 元/G ，电信联通 1~2 元/G （正规卡。假池子不谈）
而宽带上也很明显，移动宽带资费很低。
==
实在不理解，4G/5G 接入移动的网络以后，不也是要走移动自己的核心网么？ 
普遍意义上又说移动的蜂窝网络好，而移动宽带差，这不就矛盾了吗？ 移动宽带、蜂窝网络都需要接入核心网，
同时，“宽带”这种“有线”的物理介质相对来说肯定要比承载蜂窝网络的“无线”来说 ，要稳定更多啊，怎么会出现反向的情况呢？]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[最近在家里养花养鱼，养的多了， 要管理不一样的品种浇水，投喂的时间， 变得有点麻烦。
在想是不是可以开发一个喂鱼养花的小程序，
喂一次鱼就拍一下鱼缸，自动记录喂养时间。 根据识别的鱼种搜索科学的喂养周期，来提醒下次喂养的时间；提供喂养的小贴士，小技巧， 提供 AI 和人工专家来帮助用户更好的喂养。
花也是，每次浇完拍一下，结合天气、品种来推算下次需要浇水/施肥/除虫的时间； 提供视频和图文的养花教程和技巧；提供 AI 和人工专家帮用户更好的养花；
这样每次打开手机就可以合理安排浇花喂鱼的时间了，不用担心哪些花浇多了浇少了， 鱼喂多了喂少了， 遇到问题了也可以很快找到解决办法。
此外，有了每天的拍照，系统还可以将这些照片生成一个视频，像看电影加速镜头一样看待花草和鱼儿生长的变化]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Few years ago there was a project called winapps that made running windows apps. It seems to have been abandoned now and was kind of complicated to setup. A few days ago I came across a fork of the project which is actively maintained and is much easier to setup (it's still annoying to do but still quiet a bit easier).
 It It runs on docker or podman container of windows which you can RDP to access the container. It runs a VM but it's automatically configured by docker and runs very well. Runs even better than linux distros on kvm. It also integrates with the desktop(at least on GNOME) and I can also acess /home folder.
 I tried using it for office apps (word, powerpoint and excel) and it works very well. It officially supports adobe apps and a few more but I couldn't assign more than 4GB of RAM to the docker container so I haven't really tried it.
 It's a really great project and I'm really surprised that there is no talk about it on reddit or on youtube.
 Github Link
 If you want to set it up for yourself, the instructions are on the github link. Here are a few issues I ran into and how to solve them:
  
On the installing windows step the host used it really really slow and it's much better to use an iso that you download yourself and use as such.
 While creating the configuration file change the value of RDP_USER to the windows username which is probably "Docker" and RDP_PASS to the password which is initially empty.
 To run the apps you need to start the container, go the localhost log out of windows otherwise the apps won't start. To solve this just create an extra windows user and disable auto-login.
  
P.S. I tried to upload it a few days ago but it didn't get moderator approval. It wasn't rejected either, maybe noboby looked at it. This is uploaded without any changes except the P.S.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It's gonna happen eventually, the newest IA-32 only CPU that isn't designed just to run DOS for industrial/legacy applications and wasn't Edison/Quark (which didn't sell well) was made 11 years ago and it was low end back then and it was for the x86 phones that didn't sell well.
 A big deciding factor for support is "Does anybody actually use it?". Very few people need IA-32 Hardware. The 32-bit CNCs don't need a patches for Spectre or Meltdown even if they were effected, your CNC doesn't need internet access.
 I'm thinking in 7-10 years.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[eSTK 使用指北
1. 引言
随着 eSIM 技术的兴起，传统的物理 SIM 卡正在逐步被虚拟 SIM 卡取代，尤其是在需要频繁更换号码或运营商的用户群体中，eSIM 的需求越来越大。然而，在中国，eSIM 技术的发展受到了一些政策和技术的限制。因此，eSTK 应运而生，为用户提供了一种方便、灵活的 eSIM 管理方式。
2. 什么是 eSTK ？
eSTK 的定义和基本概念
eSTK（ Embedded SIM Toolkit ）是一种用于管理和操作嵌入式 SIM （ eSIM ）配置文件的工具。与传统的物理 SIM 卡不同，eSIM 是一种嵌入设备中的虚拟 SIM 卡，不需要物理插拔即可更换或添加运营商配置文件。eSTK 使用户能够通过手机的内置菜单直接下载、切换、启用或删除 eSIM 配置文件，从而简化了多个号码的管理过程。它特别适用于需要在不同国家或地区频繁切换运营商的用户，提供了灵活性和便利性。
eSTK 的主要功能和特点
eSIM 配置管理：允许用户下载、启用、禁用和删除 eSIM 配置文件，实现多号码管理。
跨平台支持：支持安卓和 IOS 设备。虽然 IOS 设备初次使用需要安卓或电脑设备，但后续操作可独立轻松完成。
3. 为什么要使用 eSTK ？
国际出行需求：对于经常出国旅行的中国用户，eSTK 能帮助他们在境外灵活切换运营商，节省漫游费用。
更好的号码管理：通过 eSTK ，用户可以在一个设备上管理多个国际号码，无需携带多个手机或 SIM 卡。
4. eSTK 的购买（https://www.estk.me/product/）
eSTK 的选择（使用优惠码 aahph 有九折优惠）
ESTKme-ECO Lite 售价 99 港币（ 91 人民币）   优惠后 89 港币（ 81 人民币）
不支持在 iPhone 上下载/切换/删除手机号码

1 ）以前网购了他家自行车，试骑了下想退，被告知可以退还城市管理人处理，这个管理人验车后说这个自行车他觉得蛮好的也要体验下，他又把自行车骑了一圈，随后找了个理由让我把自行车先拿回去，随后又联系说超出了自行车退还里程数，现在想想这个城市管理人真他么恶心
2 ）买的小米手机刚好一年多点，开不了机了，修手机的说，小米手机出现这个问题的不是你一个，很多都是这样的问题，cpu 虚焊有没有？
3 ）最后喜欢随意攻击别人的小米脑残粉，非常可怕，恐怕要出现在了帖子里，本人声明，不想回复这些 xx ，谢谢配合。]]></summary>

赶紧关了 IDEA ，又关了浏览器和 WSL ，终于好不容易给任务管理器打开了，我直接大受震撼（此时此刻按截图快捷键已经完全没有反映了，请不要吐槽用手机拍照的问题）：

切到进程选项卡看不出一点异常，所有进程磁盘占用都极高（疯狂 SWAP ，系统盘的固态写入压力也是拉爆。最绷不住的是因为占用的内存都被从 RAM 给 swap 掉了，所以内存占用看不出任何异常（包括详细信息）。

凭借我对微软多年的了解，我尝试干掉了 explorer.exe，好嘛，瞬间就不卡了……

任务管理器里显示我只开机了 2 天 8 个小时，我寻思也不是长时间没重启的问题，系统 Windows 11 23H2 22631 。
连基本的稳定运行都做不到，还是这样核心的系统组件出问题，生产力属于是大打折扣了。]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[需求和背景
最近公司开始降薪 15%并且传闻要搬到很偏的一个地方办公，逼得我又捡起了尝试了十万次的副业计划，就想试着运营一些开源的或者以前自己写的一些项目，以 Spring boot 的微服务居多。去云上看了下，现在的服务器（三台 ecs+rds+redis+elastic search ）按包一年算下来这笔钱也有点吓人，就是去掉 es 、kafka 这些贵族服务，RDS 采用 Serverless ，感觉投入也不小。根据自己经验和看了网上的一些资料:
对于应用/服务层觉得如下两种方案可行
一、是使用阿里云的 Serverless 应用引擎 SAE
这个方案有三个疑问：
其他云如腾讯云似乎没有对应的微服务的 Serverless 解决方案，它只有单服务的函数计算，这不是被绑死了云，二来想想腾讯云不应该搞不定这个，问问在座的各位彦祖亦菲，是不是我打开方式不对；
感觉这个服务是每次请求来了才会启动应用，这个延迟会不会很大；
明明是 serverless ，怎么又要让我先买资源包才能开通；
二、是把服务跑在家里的主机上，买台公网 IP 的 ECS ，通过内网穿透如 frp 把家里搭建的服务穿透出去。
这个方案的疑问是：
1.这种方案可行性如何，比如延迟、稳定性等；
2.是本地运维有没有好一些平台和框架来管理本地的一台主机和两台笔记本的集群，rancher 和 kubesphere 都没接触过，但是看起来似乎重了点。]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[在 Go 语言中，代码块内声明的标识符，只能在代码块内使用。例如函数体是个代码块，里面定义的变量，只要没发生逃逸，在外部无法访问。
但有一种特殊情况，就是在支持初始化子语句的流程语句中，初始化子语句中定义的变量，作用域会延伸到条件对应的代码块之外。请看代码：
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
	if a := 1; false {
		fmt.Println(a)
		//fmt.Println(b)   // 不能引用下面语句定义的块级变量
	} else if b := 2; a > b { 
		fmt.Println(a - b) // 可以引用上面语句定义的块级变量
	} else {
		fmt.Println(a + b) // 在最后 a 和 b 都可以引用
	}
}

左看右看也想不明白，为什么 else if 中定义的变量 b 也能在 else 块中使用？如果有更多条件判断，那么前一个 else if 中定义的变量，在之后所有 else if 块中都能使用。
在 C++ 中，if 中定义的变量 a，可以跨整个流程语句，else if 中定义的变量明确不能在其他 else 代码块中引用：
#include <iostream>

int main() {
    if (int a = 1; false) { // a 在整个 if-else 结构中可见
        std::cout << a << std::endl;
    } else if (int b = 2; a > b) {  // a 可访问
        std::cout << a - b << std::endl;
    } else {
        std::cout << a << std::endl;  // a 可访问
        // std::cout << b << std::endl;  // 错误：b 不可访问
    }
    return 0;
}

在 C# 中，规定更是严格，if 和 else if 中定义的变量，只能在随后的代码块中使用，不能跨到代码块：
public class Program {
    public static void Main() {
        if (int a = 1; false) {
            Console.WriteLine(a);
        } else if (int b = 2; a > b) {  // 错误：a 不可访问
            Console.WriteLine(a - b);
        } else {
            Console.WriteLine(a + b);  // 错误：a 和 b 都不可访问
        }
    }
}

有本 Go 语言书管这叫「惰性求值」行为，但我也仅仅是知道有这么个现象，不明白为什么会设计成这样？]]></summary>

近期凑热闹上线了个多语言站，基于 flux.1 模型的文字生成图片工具。
模型不错，令人惊艳，但是在非英文面前就是个废品，非英文输入文字极不友好，简直傻瓜。
没办法，又嵌入套层，对非英文进行翻译，使用接口实现，当然会牺牲一些速度。
基本过程就是先判断是不是英文，如果不是，翻译成英文。最终，不管什么文字，都以英文形式提交，然后进行图片生成。
毕竟，作为简体中文人，简体中文又是最大单一文化体，咋样都不能舍弃这一块。
不对简体中文友好，做多语言网站就是本末倒置。
目前免费使用、不限次数，后续看成长情况再考虑是不是搞登录、支付功能。
菜鸟第一次上线出海加 AI 概念产品，期待大佬指点！

Being able to select text in a text message is basic MVP functionality, and Google still hasn't implemented it. 
 Thank God for android and being able to switch messaging apps. I'd be losing my fucking mind otherwise lol. 
 Samsung messages also allows you to create folders, which is so handy for separating spam/auto messages from important numbers. It's also just nicer to look at IMO.
 Anyways, android is the best. Thank you for coming to my TED talk.

企业有大有小，有软件、硬件企业。如何让所有人都心甘情愿加入平台?
自定义智能家居: 以中心分析计算器为核心，有线的总线协议和无线模块共同编织信息网络。
设备共同接入的理由：（农村包围城市）
当小企业、各个领域的龙头公司都愿意参与的平台，那么像华为，小米的大公司必然会参与的，否则就会被孤立。
而小企业、各个领域的龙头公司需要的是不被约束，有想象的空间和自由。
上到，控制端的手机，遥控器可以随便选，下到，家居设备可以随心选。甚至可以 DIY ，自己的家居或者玩具。
   小公司：家电公司、软件公司，都只能完成其中的某一环节。所以中心分析计算器可以让软件公司放手创新尝试，有线的总线协议，可以让家电公司专注家电本身，不用考虑智能化，无线连接等软件问题。

   细分领域龙头公司：这类公司最大的特点就是。只专注，某一单品，无法形成生态。所以我开放的平台是他们必然的选择，因为在这里他们还是细分领域的龙头，是自由的。

   单维度的生态公司（格力，家电的领域的龙头）：这种多产品的龙头。缺失智能家居系统地完整性，加入其他生态，自己就掉价了，不加入，智能化就很差。但是加入自定义智能家居，可以完全发挥单品性能，智能化由其他专业公司补全，相互合作。尽情展示自己优势就好，交给有想法的软件公司。

   软件公司，上面说了。可以自由的发挥想象，控制家居设备，展示自己对智能化的独特理解。

   手机厂商，虽然不做智能家居但是可以，发挥手机控制家居的，花里胡哨的能力。

   最后就是像华为，小米这样的，拥有完整生态的大企业。这样的企业产品很多，看似丰富，但是我们真要全选他的产品，手机用小米的，开关用小米的，家电用小米的。如果其他的公司各类龙头公司都在玩的平台，不参与吗？真的觉得自己是“苹果”是乔布斯？

举个小众例子：
养鱼，我在家里砌了一个鱼缸，我希望可以智能控制，随时告知我。米家允许我个人 DIY 吗？
我喜欢周边、模型。不动的模型是不是很呆板，未来是不是可以有很多可动的模型，放在展柜里，除了可以被灯光照明，还可以被智能控制。]]></summary>

我想着再转给她 10w ，凑够 50w 把房贷还了，这样有娃以后会好很多（为啥要给这笔钱，因为我的房子更贵，家里已经帮我把房贷还清了，我单身，收入也远比他们夫妻俩高，所以想帮衬下）；
话说到这里，房产证本身没写我妹的名，所以还的这些贷款就显得稀里糊涂的，虽然妹夫人品很好很老实，但就怕万一后续出现什么变故，到要分财产的那一步，到时候无法将我们家给的这些钱剥离出来（我表达不太好，但感觉大家应该能猜到我在担心什么，另外我也不是故意想到分财产这种糟心事，但凡事总有万一嘛）
我是个法盲，对这块还不太懂，大家怎么看待这个事情？]]></summary>

gpt4:
这句中文"法流湛寂"有着深刻的意义，通常用于描述法律、规则或道德的平静、清晰和深邃的状态。这是一个具有哲学或精神内涵的表达，直译可能无法完全捕捉其精髓。不过，我可以给你一些较为接近的翻译：
英语翻译可以是：
"The flow of the law is serene and profound."
德语翻译可以是：
"Der Fluss des Gesetzes ist still und tief."
这些翻译试图保留原文的感觉和深度，虽然可能没有完全覆盖所有的文化和哲学意涵。
claude:
我来为您翻译这个中文短语 "法流湛寂" 成德语和英语:
德语翻译:
"Der Strom des Dharma ist tief und still"
英语翻译:
"The flow of Dharma is profound and serene"
这个短语源自佛教思想,描述了佛法的本质和特性。"法"(Dharma)指佛陀的教导,"流"表示其传播和延续,"湛寂"形容其深奥宁静的本质。
如果您需要更详细的解释或者对这个翻译有任何疑问,请随时告诉我。]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bun 的 1.1.12 和最新的 1.1.24 都试过了，均出现问题。
我调用原生的 fetch 方法，并设置 proxy 参数，我的环境变量没有设置 http_proxy 和 https_proxy。
Bun 官方对 proxy 的说明： https://bun.sh/guides/http/proxy
我的代码如下（ xxx.js ）：
// https 请求，在有 proxy 参数情况下，会先发一个 CONNECT 并且就此报错
fetch('https://www.google.com', {
    proxy: 'http://127.0.0.1:7890',
})

// 如果换成 http ，就不会发 CONNECT ，正常拿响应
fetch('https://www.google.com', {
    proxy: 'http://127.0.0.1:7890',
})

只要是 https ，就会出现下面的问题，而 http 没有：
> bun index.ts
[fetch] > HTTP/1.1 GET https://www.google.com/
[fetch] > Connection: keep-alive
[fetch] > User-Agent: Bun/1.1.24
[fetch] > Accept: */*
[fetch] > Host: www.google.com
[fetch] > Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate, br

[fetch] < 200 Connection established

Syscall: Syscall fetching "https://www.google.com/". For more information, pass `verbose: true` in the second argument to fetch()
 path: "https://www.google.com/"

上面是原生 fetch 的操作，我下面换成 axios：
import axios from 'axios'
import https from 'https'

const instance = axios.create({
    httpsAgent: new https.Agent({
        rejectUnauthorized: false
    }),
    proxy: {
        host: '127.0.0.1',
        port: 7890
    }
})

instance.get('https://www.google.com').catch(err => {
    console.log(err.message)
})

这里报错：unable to get issuer certificate
大概就是个证书有关，可是我如果不使用 proxy ，就不会有这个问题，所以这个不知道是 Bun 问题，还是 Clash 问题。
这个是我在 Bun 提的 ISSUES： https://github.com/oven-sh/bun/issues/13344
这个 40 秒的视频复现了问题： https://files.imdodo.com/dodo/083cecbf0bcc0b8f362c35b11d7e910e.mp4]]></summary>

这个 assets-manifest.json 我在开发站清空了里面的内容，发现对项目运行也没什么影响。
但是搜索下来，问了 AI,都说会对项目缓存有作用。
目前焦虑的点就是，我们上传 build 到服务器，都是增量上传，不会删除旧打包的文件，避免缓存问题，造成空白页面。但是覆盖提交，assets-manifest.json 就一直会是最新一次的文件键值对，我怕出问题，每次都手动把新增的加进去，如果对项目没影响，就不在手动操作了，不去管它了。
谢谢各位大佬解答]]></summary>

事件循环老生常谈了，社区的相关文章也非常多了，但这次为了彻底搞懂，我深度查看了规范中的规则以及 Chromium 中的源码实现。本文章作为笔记记录。
本文主要参考了 WHATWG 规范中的定义。建议直接从规范中学习。
各家浏览器对事件循环的具体实现会有细微差别，本文所有代码输出均使用 chrome 。
面试碰到很多问题，比如下面这些，面试官实际上很可能想问的是 事件循环，搞明白了之后就不用害怕被面试官牵着走了，甚至可以主动引导面试官问事件循环。

为什么 js 是异步的？

什么是微任务和宏任务？

浏览器的进程模型
进程 (Process)
定义
进程是一个正在执行的程序的实例。它包含程序代码、数据、资源（如文件、内存）以及执行中的程序计数器、寄存器和堆栈。
特点
独立性：进程是独立的执行单元，拥有自己的内存空间和资源。一个进程不能直接访问另一个进程的内存。
资源开销：创建和销毁进程的开销较大，因为操作系统需要分配和管理独立的资源。
安全性：由于进程之间相互独立，不同进程之间的错误不会直接影响彼此，提高了系统的稳定性。
示例
操作系统中的每个运行的应用程序，如文本编辑器、浏览器或计算器，都是一个进程。
线程 (Thread)
定义
线程是进程中的一个执行路径，也被称为轻量级进程（ Lightweight Process, LWP ）。一个进程可以包含多个线程，它们共享进程的内存和资源。
特点
共享资源：同一个进程内的线程…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[G'day,
 I wanted to find a way to share a no-background glxgears icon that I though together. Here it is. This of course goes in ~/.icons.
 I figured I might as well share the rest of the setup. It's quite simple, I believe that .desktop files are the most desktop user-friendly and intuitive configs I've seen so far—and so they should be.
 ~/.local/share/applications/glxgears.dektop
 [Desktop Entry] Type=Application Name=glxgears Icon=glxgears Exec=glxgears Terminal=true 
 You can also add
 ~/.local/share/applications/glxgears.desktop
 # GNOME PrefersNonDefaultGPU=true # KDE X-KDE-RunOnDiscreteGpu=true 
 to run it on your dedicated GPU.
 Note: your GPU 0 in the rest of your OS (incl. nvtop) may be your dedicated GPU, but switcheroo-ctl which is what GNOME uses tries to make the iGPU the default and the dGPU the non-default. Use $ switcheroo-ctl list to verify.
 To go even further,
 ~/.local/share/applications/glxgears-igpu.desktop
 Type=Application Name=glxgears on iGPU Icon=glxgears Exec=glxgears Terminal=true PrefersNonDefaultGPU=false X-KDE-RunOnDiscreteGpu=false 
 ~/.local/share/applications/glxgears-dgpu.desktop
 Type=Application Name=glxgears on dGPU Icon=glxgears Exec=glxgears Terminal=true PrefersNonDefaultGPU=true X-KDE-RunOnDiscreteGpu=true 
 What do you guys think of making .desktop files for command line utilities? I personally find the functionality of command line utils to be simple and efficient, but also the ease of using the Applications launcher to be very convenient. I like to mix the two worlds, because I can do that on Linux without a hex editor.

但是如果要去碰键盘最下面一排空格键左边的那几个键，我就不得不用我的胳膊肘带动左手腕移动我左手掌的位置去切换输入法，再回到传统按键区（ ASDF ）继续输入文字。在我的左手在 ASDF 键位上时，不太费力可以碰到的左边的键只有大小写锁定键和左 Shift 键（当然也有 Tab 键，但是在输入文字时单击它有它自己的功能，而单击 Shift 通常没有）。

做都做了，再顺手一个 markdown 的笔记（这个功能有点简陋）。
功能介绍
首页个人信息与横幅展示
导航页的外链展示与跳转
在主页单击名字，账号密码输入框会弹出
云笔记模块
短链服务
文件存储/分享/直链下载/鉴权
着陆页的所有内容可编辑



第一方支持 docker-compose 部署，编辑完.env一行命令就可以启动体验一下
再说一下这个文件分享，我自己还挺喜欢的。
可以生成 5 分钟有效的直链
可以设置分享密码、附言
非私有的文件也可以用 api 直接下载。直接 wget 就行。

主要包括
修复了多个出口时 conn-track 可能未按预期工作的 bug
添加了 balancer 支持，现在可以使用负载均衡作为路由出口决策，并且同时支持 conn-track
添加了新的 outbound stats 统计，可用于精确观测出口流量状况
杂项修复
修正了文档里的部署网段需求，现在要求主/旁路由处于一个独立的网段
文档添加了负载均衡和连接观测的示例配置
修复一个上游 bug 导致 leastping balancer fallbackTag 无法使用的问题
修正了之前 ROS 配置不当导致 WAN 口可接受 DNS 查询的问题（上海电信居然没封家宽 53 端口）
虽然我用的是黑名单分流，但由于是全屋科学方案，仍然比较尴尬的发现，上个月还剩一周的时候我的魔法流量已经见底了。
所以，结合我现在已有的 Prometheus 监控方案（用于监控 Mikrotik/Synology/全屋温湿度等），自然是考虑把 v2ray 也接入进来。一通捣鼓后就有了这个帖子。
必须要逮住这个偷跑我流量的耗子（
实现过程，大概是，借助现有的 v2ray-exporter ，将 v2ray 的 stats api 数据导出并转换为 Prometheus Counter metric ，顺带再魔改了一下 outbound stats ，添加了来源 IP 的 label ，这下可以精确到每一个终端的实时魔法流量情况和消耗统计了。结合 accessLog 应该就可以最终定位是谁在偷我流量啦。
fork 并修改后的 exporter 项目如下（感谢原作者 wi1dcard ）
povsister/v2ray-exporter
README 也已按需修改，有 prometheu 部署经验的可直接食用。
Release 里提供了预编译好的常见平台可执行文件，可按需下载。

 Link to screenshot of the agreement
 Important context from Mishaal Rahman:
  
This screenshot is making the rounds, so I asked around, and apparently it's indeed real.
 Just to clarify for those who don't know: Team Pixel is an invite-only program for influencers who are seen as fans of the brand. People who are part of Team Pixel will generally use that hashtag as well as #Giftfromgoogle (I believe they're required to, actually.)
 Many (most?) bloggers, journalists, and big YouTube channels are not part of Team Pixel, so please don't assume that all of us reviewing the Pixel 9 had to agree or decline these terms! I certainly did not.

Manaflow is a spreadsheet where each column represents a step instruction of a task and each row represents an AI agent executing a case of the task. With one click, you can execute thousands of tasks involving data retrieval, gluing APIs, and taking actions.
Here’s a video demo: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jwaaqjHGkT4
And a live demo: https://manaflow.ai/demo
The idea to build an AI automation tool for small-to-mid-sized businesses (SMBs) emerged from our extensive conversations with local managers, directors, and operators. We learned that SMBs are constantly overwhelmed with manual workflows and heavily underutilize technology, especially compared to bigger businesses with teams of engineers.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[背景：三年前办了个小号，专门用于快递、外卖和小平台留号。这两天想着时间挺长了，准备轮换号码，遂开始整理、注销、改绑手机号。过程还算顺利，大多数平台能够注销账号。
因为持号期间偷懒，没能完整记下到底注册、登记了哪些平台，还是会有漏网之鱼。 但更重要的是：
一个发现：快递平台用手机号登录可以看到发件人和收件人的完整地址，可能是由于没有开启隐私号码的原因？不清楚何种情况下，运单号会和手机号关联起来，显示在承运人的小程序里？
后续是我注销了那个快递平台的账号。尝试手动绑定运单号，时间较久远的运单会反馈“无法提供运单信息或运单号已过期”。
如此看来，若要安全注销此手机号，还要继续等上一年半载？各位 v 友过来人是否还有其他建议？]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[tl;dr we built an embeddable stream processing engine in Rust using apache DataFusion, check us out at https://github.com/probably-nothing-labs/denormalized
Hey HN,
We’d like to showcase a very early version of our embeddable stream processing engine called Denormalized. The rise of DuckDB has abundantly made it clear that even for many workloads of Terabyte scale, a single node system outshines the distributed query engines of previous generation such as Spark, Snowflake etc in terms of both performance and cost.
Now a lot of workloads DuckDB is used for were normally considered to be “big data” in the previous generation, but no more. In the context of streaming especially, this problem is more acute. A streaming system is designed to incrementally process large amounts of data over a period of time. Even on the upper end of scale, productionized use-cases of stream processing are rarely performing compute on more than tens of gigabytes of data at a given time.
Even so, the standard stream processing solutions such as Flink involve spinning up a distributed JVM cluster to even compute against the simplest of event streams. To that end, we’re building Denormalized designed to be embeddable in your applications and scale up to hundreds of thousands of events per second with a Flink-like dataflow API. While we currently only support Rust, we have plans for Python and Typescript bindings soon.
We’re built atop DataFusion and the Arrow ecosystems and currently support streaming joins as well as windowed aggregations on Kafka topics.
Please check out out repo at: https://github.com/probably-nothing-labs/denormalized
We’d love to hear your feedback.

我在十分钟前，不是发表了一篇帖子，帖子的内容如下：
=============帖子内容开始============
事情是这样子的：
因为无法番抢，我从那年不能上 V2 后，就很少上这个网站了。但是还是念念不忘。
这样很多年过去了，有四五年吧。
在半年前，很想上 V2 看看，就百度一下，不番抢能不能上。
果然被我找到了，开心极了，就是更改 DNS 。
改了，上了，但是每次输入域名时，会跳转到我的电商网站主页。
我就奇了怪了，遇到鬼了？真是一个恐怖的事情啊。
我忍着用吧，在后来，甚至连这上不了。
上过那么多网站，但还是想上这个 V2 ，于是在今天，我把火狐卸载了，把 CHROME 装上了。
又一次的改 DNS,又一次的我登陆了 V2 ，结果又一次的转到了我的电商网站主页了。
我用我的大脑想了想，这个跳转发生在我登陆后，如果不登陆，是不是就不可能跳转。
我于是就去设置处看一下，原来有一个设置是：自定义首页跳转，上面赫然写着我的域名，https://wwwcom
我把它删了，然后点确定，然后我输入域名，然后再点回车。
神奇的事情发生了，我上了 V2 ，我成功了。
恐怖的事情不再恐怖了，我找到了原因了。我成功了。
感谢我自己和我的唯物主义三观。
我会更加好好学习。
以上，就这。
谢谢观看。
拱手作揖，遁走。
=============原帖子内容结束============
帖子发完，我刷新，有人回，我开心。
我再看一下文中的链接，呦，可以点。
这里必须夸讲一下，中文互联网，可以在文中放链接的，不多了，可以直接点链接的，更是少之又少。
想一想微博，公众号，哪个可以放？不交保护费，哪个可以直接点的？
少则限流，重则屏蔽文章。呜呼哀哉。。
恐怖的当然不是上面的事情了，恐怖的是啥啊？
恐怖的是啊：我点开链接，我随手写的链接，竟然是一个 YELLOW 网站。
硕大的迪克，吓我一跳，为了消除影响，我把帖子沉了十天。
我再一看原帖上面，竟然有几个字母，一个是 MOVE ，一个是 EDIT.
我于是点 EDIT ，上去把这个链接修改了一下。
好了，一切正常了，可是帖子沉了十天，于是，我就又写了这个帖子。
真是的二次惊吓。
短短的一会儿时间。
阿弥陀佛，我要自闭一会了，来个心理建设。
以上，就这。
谢谢观看。
拱手作揖，遁地而走。（点发布主题，要等 510 秒再发。又一次震惊了。）]]></summary>

 Hey guys, this is something I've been working on for Linux users only. It started out as a novelty and kinda became useful. I don't really know what is defined as useful anymore though. Sort all the files in a directory or just certain extensions. Completely up to you!

这时候在软件上进行状态切换，切换到 B2 ，然后就会自动统计好在 A1 上花费的时间。
同理的，如果在进行 B2 ，然后又切换到 C3 ，也统计好 B2 上花费的时间，自动进行 C3 的开始时间记录。
最后有个图表，能清晰的看到在不同项目上的时间花费，可以进行 excel 统计表格输出。
我之前工作每周都要写周报写出什么项目花费多少时间，最后汇总等于 40 小时。
但是就是经常切来切去，最后统计的时候很麻烦，只能大概的来。

智能家居有多少种类？
	常规的家电（电视、洗衣机、冰箱、空调、台灯）、
	家装用品（灯具、开关、空气保险开关、电表、水表、天然气表、门禁、电动窗帘）、
	另类常规用品（电脑、路由器、门锁、门开关控制器、监控摄像头）
    线类（电线、网线、光纤、信号线）
    
上面这些都是应该是智能家居的商家。还有一些之前不存在的设备，比如：线路用电监控，备用电源和电源分配器，线路用电记录仪、等等。
	我们看到的都是硬件厂商。在智能家居领域会不会出现一批软件企业，专注软件的智能化。智能手机开启了移动互联网，那么智能家居会开启什么呢？？？？
上面展示了很多产品，这些产品在之前都是由各种厂家生产，质量，外观各异。不太可能由一家大公司全权控制生死。
所以需要有个开放的、公用的、通用的智能家居平台。就像安卓，IOS 。]]></summary>

https://e673.com/windows-remote-desktop-rdp-account-locked/
如果你想查看攻击者的 IP 地址，打开 事件查看器——windows 日志——安全，在审核失败的日志上双击，找到网络源地址就是攻击者的 IP ，当然，这个 IP 极大概率是肉机或者代理的 IP 。

看了下，大多数 ip 如下：
79.124.56.186
141.255.167.50 
46.19.142.242

而且尝试爆破的频率很高，基本上 20-30s 左右就爆破一次。
要是 win11 有像群晖一样，超过几次失败，直接 block ip 的功能就好了。]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[最近发现一个很奇怪的事，iOS 拼多多客户端，在没有打开通知权限的情况下居然显示出了通知角标，有人遇到类似问题吗？
权限设置如下，可以看到是没有通知权限的，拼多多甚至应该都没有请求过通知权限，如果请求过我通过或者拒绝了这里应该是有纪录的。

再看拼多多的设置，新消息提醒也是关闭的。

但是，看桌面，显示出了角标。然而虽然有角标，全程拼多多是没有在通知栏里弹过通知的。

这里补充个细节，当收到新消息时，拼多多并不在通知栏里弹出通知，角标也并不会立即增加。但打开拼多多 app 再返回桌面后，角标变了，更新成了最新的通知数目。有点怀疑是不是并不存在走 iOS 系统通道的通知，而是拼多多在启动后，直接更换了自己的应用图标，创建了一个包括了右上角角标的新应用图标，所以角标数目才在打开 app 时才更新成最新的。]]></summary>

然后搜到了他们的文档： https://help.ente.io/auth/migration-guides/steam/ ，逐照着做。
根据提示来到了 https://github.com/dyc3/steamguard-cli/releases/tag/v0.14.2 ,但一下载那个 steamguard.exe ，马上就被报毒了，嘿，还是个勒索病毒，看得我头皮发麻：
病毒名称：Ransom/Filecoder.c （勒索病毒）
病毒 ID：6CF3F7E3A4CBFD25

我想问问：
这是个什么玩意儿？搜了下 ente auth 在外网的风评，好像还不错，而且自身也是开源的。那它这么眉清目秀的 app ，怎么文档里还勾搭上了勒索病毒了？这 ente auth 真可信吗？
好久没中过病毒了。像我这样只是把 exe 下载下来，马上就被杀软给隔离、没有执行它，是不是绝对安全了？]]></summary>

1 、一般是首页代码里要有对方反链(常识礼仪)；
2 、检测自己首页代码是不是服务端渲染输出的（可以页面右键看源码），代码里 Ctrl+F / command+F 能 找到对方域名则是服务端渲染的，没有就排查是前端动态加载了，类似 js 输出，打印之类，搜索爬虫都不好这口。|
3 、如果域名托管的是 Cloudflare （划重点来了，我就栽在这了），需要检查有没有关闭爬虫阻止程序 bot flight ，其他服务商应该也类似。
4 、检查自己 robot.txt 里有没有有禁止爬虫（基础也再讲一次）
5 、建议不浪费时间同时也给对方管理员发邮件（两手准备，真诚搞好关系）

用户打开内部网站，访问 Chat UI 界面
这个 ChatUI 会连接到公司内的 AI 接口（ restful ，已经买了 Azure AI 服务，被公司专门负责 AI 的部门包了一层），所以这个 Chat UI 也可以弄得就像就类似于 ChatGPT 那样，但不必实现 ChatGPT 的调用，所以只需要个聊天框就行
所有资源全部加载到本地，各种查询操作均从用户浏览器直接向 AI 接口发送/接收，不经由 Web 服务器中转，这样就算 Web 服务器短暂重启、掉线都不会影响用户使用
如果界面漂亮花俏就更好
初步考虑 angular 或者 react ，其他 js 框架也行，大家有什么好推荐吗？
谢谢啦！
顺便问问，JS 版 Azure AI SDK 和 LangChain 是否支持本机浏览器运行？
其他部门有人吐槽说“AI 包装部”不是很好用，所以我的同事认为需要做好打算，ChatUI 框架通过 Azure AI SDK 或者 LangChain 直接跟 Azure AI 服务做交互。]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[8月1日，《魔兽世界》正式服上线，“地心之战”前夕内容发布更新，更新内容包括战团系统、驭空术、职业与系统更新，与此同时，网易还进行了免费活动，用户可以免费领取14天魔兽世界，免费重新体验《魔兽世界》国服正式版。


做为魔兽世界的老玩家，我也再次踏入这片古老而神秘大陆：艾泽拉斯，如今，两周的时间转瞬即逝，以下，便是我这两周以来，在艾泽拉斯世界中的深刻体验与感悟。


宕机、掉线和卡顿


开服首日，官方公布的时间是十二点开服，由于同时使用角色直升等增值服务的玩家数量过多，十二点一到，服务器就宕机了，怎么也无法使用了，提前通知十二点开服就是这种结果。


第二天网易就升级服务器带宽，情况好一些了，但还是会掉线，平均几乎每天都卡掉线一次。周六和周日，开始和完成世界任务都会卡一下，怀疑是因为开始和完成世界任务的时候，切换了相位，或者是读取多个服务器数据。


这种频繁的掉线和卡顿，只有在14天免费期过去了之后才逐渐好转了一些了。


前夕活动：光耀回响


第一个星期主要是小号练级，前夕事件让我把全职业的小号都练到满级了。


本次正式服的回归开服为玩家们带来了多个重大活动，其中光耀回响事件是本次回归期间最重要的活动之一。玩家达到10级之后即可自动接取光耀回响，然后跟随任务指引找到卡德加，卡德加旁边有三个光耀回响的传送门，分别是：灼热峡谷-尘泥沼泽-龙骨荒野，只要进入三个传送门，根据要求完成任务就行了。


前夕光耀回响事件真是个“练级神器”，让升级变成一个简单到了极致的事情，挂机也能升级到满级，只要关闭时空漫游，坐骑改为稳定飞行，整点时候去达拉然中心，跟着大部队进入传送门，就可以挂机练级了，大部队去哪里，就可以飞哪里，基本上一小时能升10级，从10级挂机到70级满级就要6小时就够了，还送一大堆回响币，可以购买装备包包什么的。

还有就是变量,函数的重命名, ide 里面能找到全部地方的一起重命名, vscode 的 F2 重命名有时候就只能重命名当前文件内的,其他地方的就还是原来的名字.  感觉很可惜,  因为 vscode 很多地方自定义还是很爽的, 可以支持 neovim, 光标移动很, 写起代码来很舒服很爽. 但是这些基础功能缺了就很烦, 不过写 rust 倒是比 ide 舒服多了]]></summary>

预算 30w 以内，目前有考虑的车型包括：
小鹏 G6,G9
乐道 L60 ，蔚来 ES6
理想 L6,L7
零跑 C11 
使用场景：
85%：工作日日常通勤来回 30km 内
10%：周末偶尔来回 200km 内
5%：节假日回老家或者长途自驾游单程 500km+
主要市区通勤，所以还是倾向于纯电车型
小定乐道 L60 主要还是考虑到换电挺方便没有里程焦虑;同蔚来产线品质应该还可以。另外空间从曝光参数来看，家用还是足够的。
先试驾看看，反正定金可退😂]]></summary>

机箱：安钛克 P101-S （已购买）
CPU：CC150 （已购买） i3-8100 （闲置 CPU 可用于装系统调试等等）
主板：Z390 太极 Ultimate （因为板载有 AQUANTIA® / Marvell 万兆网卡 和两个千兆网卡）
内存：32GB * 4
硬盘：淘宝买一些 SAS 硬盘 6TB×8
系统盘：两个笔记本淘汰下来的 512GB 的 M.2 固态用来放虚拟机系统，可能再加一条安装 PVE
系统：PVE ，搞个 openwrt 软路由（两个 core ），搞个 TrueNAS Scale ，搞个 Windows 10/11 （两个 core ）
还需要买一块 SAS 扩展卡
网卡：暂时没有额外需求，家里的宽带也就 200M
主要有以下需求或问题：
满足家庭（大概 5 个人）的上网需求，主路由 openwrt, 利用万兆口做 LAN ，配合 10G 2.5G 交换机 和路由器。
家庭成员资料的备份，照片用 immich 。
TrueNAS Scale 上运行个 Docker 下载点影视资源什么的。
对预算不是特别敏感，主要是想一劳永逸。
针对以上，各位大佬有没有什么看法或者意见建议☺️]]></summary>

 I feel like new phone releases, specially this year don't bring anything (apart from a slight redesign of the hardware) really new that is not based on software. Software that really should be fine running on 3rd gen old flagships. Before we would get huge improvements on battery, camera, charging speed, screen, etc. Now is just "ai this" and "generate that"; oh and also "now its $100-$200 more"
 I've seen the last Samsung and now the Google event and I don't see anything that would make me want to spend any money to get some features that should be able to get on my current phone (even if I don't care for them).
 This years new phones specially the ones from Samsung and Google (and most likely Apple later on) makes me say "This could've just been a software update"

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When I informed myself about Linux I heard about Timeshift and it sounded like a good idea, so I installed it and set daily, weekly, and monthly backups system snapshots. Now, after roughly six months of use I reboot my computer after doing a sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade, and my system is trashed. The GPU drivers aren't recognized, 2/3 of my displays arent recognized, I can't connect to the internet (I use ethernet) and my keyboard doesn't work anymore.
 I reboot a couple of times and can't find out what the problem is (maybe because I don't have a clue about what I'm doing, but that's kind of the point of this post). I reset the 12 hour old save state of Timeshift, which took a about 5 minutes, and everything works perfectly again.
 I love Linux so much.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The share of state-owned enterprises (SOEs) in Sweden's economy is not explicitly detailed in the search results. However, it is noted that public-sector spending in Sweden accounts for up to three-fifths of GDP, and in 2014, the percent of national wealth owned by the government was 24%. Additionally, SOEs are significant in various sectors across Europe, including Sweden, particularly in network industries like energy and transport. This suggests that while specific figures for Sweden's SOE share are not provided, SOEs play a substantial role in certain sectors of the economy.
关于瑞典经济中的国有企业（ SOE ）份额，搜索结果中没有明确的详细信息。然而，据了解，瑞典的公共部门支出占国内生产总值（ GDP ）的五分之三，而在 2014 年，政府拥有的国民财富比例为 24%。此外，国有企业在包括瑞典在内的欧洲各国的多个行业中具有重要地位，特别是在能源和交通等网络行业。这表明，尽管没有提供瑞典国有企业份额的具体数据，但国有企业在经济的某些领域中发挥着重要作用。
简直是国进民退的典范。]]></summary>

I’m curious to understand how he might has achieved this. Could it be due to a known exploit, bug, or glitch in the system? Any insights on how this could be done?

如果是用 WindowsUSB 口，拔下来之前点击弹出，就不会损坏硬盘，Apple 设备读取没问题，但是 USB 口的速率就只有不到 400mb 每秒。
接 c 口的时候，是没有弹出硬盘的选项的，似乎是被 Windows 识别成了内置的硬盘。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[起因
收到了一封钓鱼邮件（很常见的事情），点开链接时发现居然是 zoho 的登录 UI 。
这是我第一次见到没有使用通用邮箱模板钓鱼的网站，所以深入试了试
前排提醒：钓鱼网站，不要输真实信息，链接 base64: aHR0cHM6Ly9wcm9maWxlLmNvcnJlY3RvaW4uY2xpY2svbWVzc2FnaW5nLmh0bWw/d2ViPWV4YW1wbGVAb3V0bG9vay5jb20=
后文为了防止链接自动识别，域名里面的点全部使用 # 替换
结论
后面跟着的 messaging.html?web=example@outlook#com ，可以把邮箱换成其他任意邮箱
1. 如果是一个知名的邮箱服务，他会返回对应模板的钓鱼页面
目前我试出来了有专门的 UI 的（抄正版网站） qq#com, 163#com, 126#com, outlook#com, protonmail#com, zoho#com, aliyun#com, mailgun#com, Internxt#com, yandex#com, yahoo#com, aol#com, feishu#cn
不过比较奇怪的是，没有收录 gmail#com ，返回的是 3. 默认模板 + Google 图标。
2. 如果是一个有 MX 记录的域名（通常是托管在其他平台的域名邮箱），会返回托管网站的页面
例如我自己的 v2ex-test@contact-me#email, v2ex-test@zsh2517#com
随便测试能出来的如 test@bilibili#com (outlook), test@xiaohongshu#com (outlook), test@csdn#net (qq) 等
首次访问出不来可以等一会多试几次
3. 如果没有对应的模板，会返回一个网站 icon + 默认模板
例如 github#com, gitlab#com, android#com, x#com 等
4. 还有一些网站会报 404
例如 example#com 等
补充：2 、3 的情况下，访问一个新的网站会有明显延迟，推测对于新增的域名，甚至会现场尝试解析或者抓取图标]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[今天我们聊一聊电影。
死侍与金刚狼
昨天去电影院看了《死侍与金刚狼》，说实话这个电影一般，双方莫名其妙的打了起来，又莫名其妙的和好了。多元宇宙这个词，就像死侍说的，已经被漫威玩烂了，死去的英雄又复活，原来前一部设定好的剧情，这一部又被推倒重来。
总结这部电影就是个爆米花电影，你就为自己的情怀买单或者无脑跟着死侍吐槽傻笑就完事了。
在电影结束的时候，放了很多金刚狼拍摄的花絮，却勾起了很多逝去的回忆。
金刚狼主演或者参演的电影一共有十部，最早的一部是 2000 年的《 X 战警》，后面《 X 战警》又出了很多部，再后来又为金刚狼为主线拍了好几部。
休杰克曼与金刚狼
休杰克曼，演了这个角色二十多年，在花絮里他透露，当他第一次定好妆容时，工作人员甚至问他：你是谁啊，金刚狼是长你这个样子吗？
而现在，只要看到休杰克曼，就想到了金刚狼，看到金刚狼，就想到了休杰克曼，他演活了这个角色。漫画里金刚狼是个个子很矮的杀人机器，而休杰克曼演的，虽然脾气火爆，但是身材高大威猛，那一身的腱子肉，站在那里就让人望而生畏了。
在血脉喷张的杀戮背后，休杰克曼赋予了这个角色更深邃的层次，他迷茫，痛苦，矛盾，思索人生的意义，思考爱情的真谛，他渴望爱人，又害怕爱人，他想要亲情，却又害怕 失去。表面漠不关心，背地里却总是为团队做的牺牲最大的那个，就像他对小狼女说的，每个我爱或者爱我的人最后都因为我死去，我眼睁睁的看着他们死去，却无能为力。
X 战警的印象
第一次出场在《 X 战警》中，金刚狼给我的感觉很复杂，说他很菜吧，他有利爪，又有极强的自愈能力，说他很强吧，他跟魔形女打架，却打不赢，感觉他很笨重，不灵活，跟万磁王单挑，无奈万磁王就是他的克星，一招就把他制服。
后来几部 X 战警陆续出来，虽然他做了很多的牺牲，差点被小淘气吸光生命，忍痛送走了琴，都没有给人留下很深的印象。这个系列电影里的变种人实太多，大家都各有所长，所以他没有那么出众吧。
金刚狼系列电影
但自从金刚狼系列电影出来，一下子就被这个角色深深吸引，形象变得特别立体了。
《金刚狼》第一部终于弄清楚了他的身世由来，为什么叫做金刚狼，金刚利爪是怎么来的，一一做了解答。这部电影里再也没有觉得他又菜又厉害了，后期做完手术 carry 全场，太帅了。
《金刚狼》第二部主要发生在日本，增加了很多日本的元素：和服，武士刀，新干线。开头那幕，被原子弹的烈火包围，整个人都被灼烧殆尽，但是又很快复原，徒手从心脏里取出机械虫子，强悍的跟个怪物一样，但是他和真理子在一起，制造了很多的反差，像是美女与野兽。
而在第三部里也表现的很反差，当金刚狼逐渐衰老，当金刚利爪无法伸出，当自愈能力越来越弱时，他也进入了每个普通人的宿命：迟暮与死亡。而根据他的基因培育出来的劳拉，也就是小狼女，正是勃勃生机，无限活力的时候。
老头与萝莉，开着一辆快报废的车子，行使在无边无际，渺无人烟的沙漠里，还有比这更吸引人眼球的组合吗？最后他为了救下一代的变种人而选择自我牺牲，劳拉哭着喊着他 daddy 的时候，几乎要泪目，这是这个角色最高光的时候，他选择一种最伟大的解脱自己的方法。
每个人都有英雄情节吧，有的是父亲，有的是超人，有的是孙悟空，他们拥有我们不曾拥有，也永远不会拥有的能力，他们就是这个平凡世界围墙里的一道光，带我们冲突高楼大厦的禁锢，走向幻想的无限世界。
休杰克曼之后，再无金刚狼。
顺便预言一下：既然马斯克这么喜欢 X ，会不会收购 X 战警呢？]]></summary>

引用下我在 Github 仓库（ https://github.com/chengxuyuanchuhai ）所说，代表我的看法：
UncleLeon 心声
UncleLeon 认为，2023-24 年大模型 AI 技术的狂飙猛进带来了新的机遇，个人能力因 AI 得到了急剧放大（我个人目前的体会至少是 10 倍放大），以前独立开发者不能做的事情现在可以做了。走出去面向全球市场，我认为是存在一些机会的，也能提高自己的能力和视野。加上现在不健康的职场环境，至少尝试下还是值得的。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[当前痛点：
1 、各做各的系统，很难兼容，各大公司主观上也不愿意互通。
2 、操作很麻烦。安装各家的 APP 需要给设备一一联网，
3 、不解决过硬痛点，普通人不会买，都是科技博主，发烧友会用。门槛高。

解决方案：
总线协议＋中心分析计算器。
总线协议：是一对多协议，用一根线就可以把家里所有的设备连起来。设备联网也只需要插上电就好了，无障碍。

中心分析计算器：类似于安卓系统，能够获取所有家电设备数据，然后通过安装不同的插件（或软件），实现不同的功能，显示自定义的智能化。

优势：
1 、中心分析计算器，可安装各种插件，实现不同的功能。（插件就像 APP ，可以自由开发。）
2 、低门槛，大家都可以上，由于是插电的，比无线的更简单。没有通讯壁垒和生态壁垒，没有版权问题。
3 、插上就可以用，没有使用门槛也不需要安装 APP ，做初始化。
4 、生态万家共创，一家专心一样。设备商专心做设备性能，智能化由专业的来实现。

备注：
遥控智能：通过 APP 控制家居的工作状态。功能比较呆板，系统封闭。

自定义智能：可以像智能手机一样，通过安装不同的软件（插件）实现不同的智能能力。]]></summary>

Here’s a quick video overview: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHTw9VH8bCw
Discounts have traditionally been a bit of the ‘wild west’ of pricing. Optimization techniques at even the largest merchants are heavily manual. Product level discounting decisions are distributed among operations or category managers, and store-wide discounts are often set by marketers. Typically they rely on order history, look at competitor discounts, or find prior discount performance to inform their decision. But there’s not a lot of science behind choosing the discount, and teams don’…]]></summary>

   a. 本人四十多岁失业，工作难找还在找，但仍想改变世界（ qie kuai dan gao ）；  
   b. 用 Rust 开发过一个以太坊的 Web3 小应用，但不熟其他区块链；  
2. 缘由：遇到生活中运行十几年的一套做法，觉得可为原型，做成 Web3 应用（或游戏），有前景；
3. 需求：找人搭伙，前期两三个人聚一起学习，研究，设计，合作。我设想是先在电报的 TON 上研发。
4. 现状：我没实际参与过，但找到了行家里手可以教我们。我是想组团学习，将其数字化，类似于封闭开发的前期设计，
5. 供给：我这个年纪的都要吃饭养家。我最大能力是每天给你 100 元人民币临时养着家；来回路费给予补助（远近和出行方式再商议）。
6. 找人：
   a. 跟我差不多年纪仍雄心勃勃的的中年人或前辈，
   b. 一边学习，一边找工作，一边寻求新方向新产品的，
   c. 有 Web3 开发基础（会电报 TON 的最好，还请您教我），
   d. 有其它技术，对此事感兴趣，但不会开发区块链，愿意学习以太坊 + Rust 开发，我可以用我的小应用逐步教你，同时我付钱就少了，需要您负担一部分，

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey everyone, while learning about Apple and Android ecosystems, I've noticed a lot of people talking about AirDrop as if it's some kind of magical feature, or how amazing it is to use a Windows computer with a Samsung phone. Well, let me tell you: Good morning! I've been using Linux for at least 6 years now and my Pixel 4 (which, according to a friend, is faster than a 14 Max) for almost 5.
 KDE Connect is an application developed for the KDE Desktop Environment on Linux, but it works on any Linux distribution, even with GNOME (in fact, it's almost better integrated). It also has a respective app for Android (I don't know about iOS but I don't think so).
 You can do everything with it: control your PC in real time, using the keyboard, scrolling, mouse input with a double tap to click, etc., send files using your home Wi-Fi very easily (from PC: right-click -> send to device name, from phone: share -> KDE conn. -> send to name), execute any terminal command from your phone, which allows you to do whatever you want with your phone (I use it to lock my PC, turn it off), and you'll also have simultaneous notifications, a shared clipboard (both incoming and outgoing or as you prefer) and a lot of other really cool things that I invite you to try.
 I wanted to tell you about this because big companies are selling what a group of developers created a few years ago, and they did it better and for free.
 Download KDE Connect and you'll see that's all you need to have an ecosystem between devices, so much so that even my Apple fan friends were speechless.

写出来都是我要写的样子.... 比如手写字母 u, 就是我在纸上写的样子, 不会变成字母 v 的样子. 
新购置的 iPad Air, 用一两分钟 GoodNote, 就会感觉到热.
发热程度, 和老设备相当. 
想问问大家,

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've spent the past year and a half developing OpenDeck, primarily with the intent to bring the expansive ecosystem of Elgato Stream Deck plugins to custom or third-party hardware, and realised early on that it could also be used to restore the full functionality of first-party Elgato devices on unsupported operating systems, such as our beloved GNU+Linux.
 After many hours in development, the (MIT-licensed) software supports the usage of many OpenAction and Stream Deck SDK plugins (such as the ones featured here and here), with Elgato Stream Deck and Ajazz AKP153 hardware (and my custom, not available publicly, "ProntoKey" hardware) on Windows, macOS, and GNU+Linux. I'm posting here to invite testers for the release candidate version, available as a `.deb`, `.rpm`, `.AppImage` (not recommended), and from the AUR. Contributions for additional hardware, features, or bug fixes would also be thoroughly appreciated!
 Please do leave feedback or questions in the comments of this post, on Matrix, Discord, or GitHub Issues. Enjoy!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[作为一个后端开发程序员，一直都在写着看不见页面的业务接口，日子久了，这无疑是令人厌烦的一件事情，因为想要开发自己的产品，成为独立开发者，仅仅懂后端的业务逻辑还不够，更需要知道如何构建前端的展示界面、用户交互，之前一直有在学习前端相关的知识，但是也仅仅停留在学习，知识虽然有了，但是啥东西也做不出来。后面接触了 Flutter ，觉得挺容易上手的，于是工作之余抽空写了一个练手项目为日后开发自己的产品做准备。
开发心得：
有了产品 idea 后，可以立马开始开发了，不用等全都会了在开始，可以在开发等过程中逐渐学习和掌握相关的知识。
通过这次的练手项目，学会了 Flutter 状态管理（ RiverPod,GetX ）、如何构建页面，网络请求、主题切换等相关知识，win10 和 macOS 安装包制作。
开发完成后效果图如下：

项目已开源，链接在之前发的帖子当中，想要学习 Flutter 或者感兴趣的友友可以看看：

大背景：
几个月前，来到这家公司，2 个月前开始与之前就存在的乙方公司开始合作，处理之前就已经在跑的业务。
我们作为甲方，公司的盈利模式是从乙方采购安卓平板电脑。定制应用给特定的行业，因此应用也不单独外发，就是预装到平板中，给特定的行业用。
我们这边只有应用开发，因为不对外发布，有时候产品需求就比较有针对性。
小故事背景：
新需求：
产品想让我们的应用出厂（我们应用是预置在平板内的）就自动获取某个权限 A ，产品的意思是别让用户再确认一次。
大家应该知道安卓后来的权限管的也比较严格了，多数情况下用户不授权，应用是拿不到某些权限的。
这里我们不去讨论产品这个需求合理与否，也不讨论应用层面有没有其他解决方案。
反正最后的结论是给乙方提需求，让他们从 framework 层进行修改，我们应用就正常开发就行了，不需要做任何修改。

人员配置方面，我们甲方这边，技术接口人是我，我属于研发部。还有厂商对接人 W ，属于硬件部。我们不是一个部门的，W 不懂安卓技术。
乙方的人员配置： 技术对接人 Q ，需求对接人 L

需求沟通开始。
前期沟通需求，评估工作量都比较顺利，感觉乙方 Q 比较认真仔细。他会整理每一天需求到一个表格中，让我们这边确认。
哎不对啊？前面不是说，你们的需求只有一条，就是出厂自动获取权限 A 这一条吗？怎么这里还要整理表格了？
其实是我们甲方的 W 觉得这一条需求太简单了，把之前一些鸡毛蒜皮的小需求也加进来了。
比如在在系统设置中隐藏选项 A ，让某个选项不能点等等这种。其实就是半天就能搞完那种改 UI 的需求。
算上前面说的默认给权限 A 那个需求，一共凑合 5 条。
所以开会的时候，乙方 Q 整理到表格中，一条一条确认。最终乙方评估的工作量是一周时间。
我不懂 framework ，咱也没法判断这个一周时间是长…]]></summary>

房子是两室一厅（一室两厅改的），厨房卫生间齐全，民用水电，自己交。转租的是主卧。旧合同是 8 月 25 到期，到期直接和房东签约。厨房设施齐全，装修虽然不新潮，但是干净，没甲醛。
交通方便，离地铁 12 号线步行 10min+， 生活便利小区外就是菜市场，街道小吃多，下个路口就是印象城商场。
我本身再漕宝路上班，工作较稳定，很注意清洁和安静。基本互相之间不会打扰。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[笔记本电脑, Thinkbook 14+ 2023, 配置挺高的:
处理器	13th Gen Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-13700H   2.40 GHz
机带 RAM	32.0 GB (31.7 GB 可用)
系统类型	64 位操作系统, 基于 x64 的处理器
前一阵子不知道为何, 在没有改变硬件/软件的情况下, 出现了两个很烦人的问题.
1. 时不时的 (一般每隔几十分钟) 就会出现 输入东西上屏很卡. 晃动鼠标指针时就能变得顺畅了.
   感觉好像就是系统在移动鼠标指针时候才能高效响应.
   不是鼠标的问题, 只用触摸板也是同样的问题. 也不是输入法的问题, 换了微信输入法/百度输入法/微软自带的输入法/甚至直接打英文都是一样的.
      下面有图片和视频.
2. 也是在上面问题 1 发生的同时, 发现拖动窗口时候有部分残留在原来的位置, 卡个 1~2 秒后也能到拖动串口位置. 下面有图片和视频.
试过了重置系统, 更新驱动, 刷新率 60Hz/90Hz, 都没啥用.
之前 1 年多用的都是好好的, 前几个星期出现的问题, 快给我搞崩了...卡的时候太影响使用了. 再不好都快想换电脑了.
有没有朋友/大神帮忙看看 咋回事 十分感谢]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[这个月一下子遇到好多事情，一系列连锁反应，好焦虑，不知道要咋度过这个难关
工资
正好要开始存钱了，但工资却发不出来了，如果发了工资那其他事情就都不是事了
房租
目前一个人住套二，15 号要支付房租 2600 ， 起因就是五月初在国外的同学要回国，我们之前关系就很好，好像也刚好飞机直飞我这，就说来我这找工作上上班啥的，然后五一都在玩、找房子（刚好当时我跳槽到另一家公司，住的地方比较远也需要找新的房子），但其实这几个月也都一直躺家里，然后 8 月初提过几句要回去了，但也没说具体时间也没当回事，后面周五晚上说第二天送他去机场就这样走了（付了全部违约金）~ 然后只有两周时间找房子，但其实最多周末去找，下班后到家就七点了，没多少时间，也没合适的房源，就打算再住一个月，等开学就好找了，找个好的，常住
信用卡
因为没工资，没存款，所以只能办信用卡或者贷款去过渡一下了（分期也无所谓我平时也没花钱的需求）而且这两个月贷款短信老是发，建行、中行、农行、农商等特别多， 但是申请信用卡又全拒了（小米手机短信有个分类我左边通知就都是被拒，右边推广又都是贷款），至于为啥不早点就申请，我 3 月没工作时就申请过没过，就打算等着工作稳定在申请，刚好三个月转正然后又发不出工资，也不知道为啥不给办，我家庭也没失信人员，就一家平凡农村人。 
身份证过期
明天正好身份证要过期了，又可能产生一堆影响，我是提前一个多月去办的，但预约挺满的，也不知道办的情况咋样了~
我能想到的解法就是向父母借钱了，但很难说出口，因为前几个月才把父母钱还完，工作了两年，第一份工作挣的钱不多，用来买新电脑和去杭州工作了，杭州的几份工作都不满意，也是离职和入职的切换所以没存多少钱，到了年底找不到工作才向父母借钱，不过还当时给飞书多维表写插件赚激励，差不多 15+个插件，天天去催也才过审几个，飞书完全可以说我代码垃圾不给上，但拖着不过审是真恶心，接了用户需求，完成了需求，用户使用了满意了，又不给上。但最恶心的是用户试用，等大半个月官方自己出了收费版，更是**
还有个 非法辞退、拖欠工资的官司 一套流程也深入我心，让恐高的我爬 10 米高的卸货船拆监控，拒绝被辞，离职时工资给我按 30 天基数算，不服仲裁后公司直接把工资改成了 2280 ，即使有着和财务的语音证据，但也没啥用。也先不细讲了，走一步看一步
其实每件事情都提前计划好了，但计划跟不上变化，世事难料或者就是我太傻了，之后肯定会好好调整调整，放慢脚步，上班专心写业务，下班专心搞开源或干些兼职。]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Breakly 是一款手机端的防沉迷应用，通过定时提醒和应用屏蔽，强制用户休息，进而减少沉迷。主要功能有：
小憩和休息：根据”20-20-20”法则，设置两种长短休息时间，保护视力，降低沉迷度；
严格模式：在小憩和休息期间屏蔽应用，屏蔽期间无法解除，强制用户休息；同时，提供白名单设置功能，可以将电话、钉钉等办公 App 加入白名单；
智能使用计时：具有息屏自动暂停计时和息屏一定时间后重置计时等功能。
我自己作为 Breakly 的第一个用户，使用后觉得很有效。刷短视频时，定时提醒让我意识到自己已经看了很长时间。通过强制休息迫使我放下手机，休息结束后，虽然我会继续看完当前的短视频，但我不再有一直刷下去的冲动。
如果你也希望减少手机使用时间，但自控力不足，不妨试试 Breakly ，说不定会有意想不到的效果。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Nowadays, Linux is very easy to use for the average user in popular distros. GNOME and KDE are excellent desktop environments, which has allowed many people to switch to a simple distro like Ubuntu or Linux Mint without missing their old systems. I have been using Linux as my primary system for about two years, and I've learned a lot. Broadly speaking, I've noticed two types of Linux users:
  
FOSS User: Concerned with open source and security.
 Just Works User: Only interested in a system that works.
  
Both types of users are fine with me (though I identify more with the first). However, Linux's philosophy is very focused on open source and respecting user data. Now, here's my doubt (or fear): It seems that big companies are increasingly eyeing Linux, and we might see many Windows/macOS apps here, whether through Flatpak, Flathub, or something similar. I also see a lot of hardware support, but much of that is closed source, which doesn't align with Linux's philosophy. 
 So, it appears that the mainstream market is starting to focus on Linux, but they don't care about its philosophy. And if the mainstream market turns its attention to Linux, the masses will follow. But the masses don't care about the philosophy (and I'm not saying that's wrong). It seems that this niche that was once free from monitoring and malware might turn into an environment just like the one we were trying to escape from. Smaller distros might have to shift to this new model as they see that distros less aligned with the philosophy, like Ubuntu or Fedora, will grow. 
 I don't know, does anyone else share this doubt, or am I exaggerating?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[前言
下个月 9 号就入境瑞典满 2 周年，越来越喜欢瑞典的生活，小崽崽也很幸运地收获了一对瑞典“爷爷奶奶”。
在此分享一些在瑞典的生活给需要的人。如果不喜欢润学的人，请直接略过，本人就此谢过。
1. 生活
生活上，确实没有什么压力，唯一的压力就来自于还没有身份，担心自己可能随时会失业，然后找不到工作，被迫回国。其它闲暇的时候，看看窗外的蓝天白云，出门走走，爬爬山，逛逛湖，摘摘蓝莓，约朋友一起带小孩，一起吃饭。就很普通，平淡的生活。
衣
现在还穿着 20 年双 11 在优衣库买的裤子，迪卡侬 19.9 和 29.9 一件的体恤。
在瑞典，只买 outlet ，宝宝有一半的衣服买的二手，鞋子都是买的亚瑟士的打折款，价格不算贵。对于穿戴，我跟我媳妇都没什么追求，好不好看，怎么搭配，不怎么关心，只要暖和，价格合理就行。
食
几乎天天在家做饭，偶尔出去玩的时候外面吃。主要是中餐，米饭为主。偶尔去邻居家吃点瑞典餐。一个月，一家人 3 ～ 5k 克朗（ 2k ～ 3.5k RMB ）的生活费了。
住
买了一个小公寓，四层顶楼，附近有山，有蓝莓，幼儿园就在旁边，住着很舒服。
自从看了朋友买的别墅，对别墅没有太深的执念了。不是说不好，而是我发现我根本不愿意打理。就像我对门女邻居，父母去世的时候，留下的别墅，她给卖了，然后就住在我们对门的公寓。
行
平时坐公交，就是比较费时间。等媳妇今年拿了驾照，明年买个二手的卡罗拉，也算是人生的第一辆车。车，除了代步，没啥别的需求。
我之前在深圳湾一号上班的时候，天天穿个沃尔玛 29.9 的拖鞋，迪卡侬 19.9 的体恤，迪卡侬 40 块钱的短裤。当时 HR 跟我去喝咖啡，从旁边的 5 星级酒店路过的时候，HR 说真怕那个保安把我拦下来😅。
日常开销
我一个人挣钱，养一家人，还有点剩。供着房贷，物业费（ 4.7k 克朗，折合 3.3k RMB ），交一点…]]></summary>

 power-profiles-daemon 0.21 changed the behavior. When plugged in, the balance_performance EPP is selected, but when running on battery, the balance_power EPP is selected instead.
 It depends on the device, but performance is significantly worse. Even on relatively recent and performant hardware (My system has an i5-10310U) you may notice that things like loading web pages and opening applications are now significantly slower when running on AC power.
 Obviously, selecting balance_power will result in lower power draw than balance_performance, which should improve battery life. That's fine and all, but the big problem with this c…]]></summary>

请教，如果遇到如上情况：
1. 除了返厂硬件维修，是否还有其他办法重置密码？
2. 硬盘内资料是否可以插入 Mac 导出（因为没有现成硬盘盒，所以无法直接测试，想请教一下）
3. 如果无法插入 Mac 并导出资料，是否可买一台新的 QNAP NAS （旧的已经停产，可能需要买新款），插入硬盘后继续无缝使用？

软件开屏广告也就算了，连一个干净的操作系统都要植入广告位。
说到 App 就又不得不提“臃肿”二字了，一个 App 能刷视频、能买东西、能贷款、能聊天、甚至还能加个虚幻引擎让你在里面玩游戏。新买的手机打开淘宝、百度网盘这些“超级应用”都能卡顿，更别说用个一两年之后更新到那种程度了。

对此，腾讯客服回应称，已接收消息不会清理，但是微信服务器会自动清理未保留信息，具体机制如下：
- 对于未接收的消息：微信服务器保存 3 天，会在 3 天后自动清理这些消息，清理后无法再接收。
- 对于已接收并下载或查看的消息：这些消息将被保存在用户的设备中，并且可以永久查看。
想知道，手机收到推送，但没去打开微信，这种算接收还是未接收？]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[背景：
最近工作越来越杂，有的时候总是想不起来一些事情，公司提供的是 office 365 ，其中包含 onenote ，但是 onenote 我不太喜欢用，而且再 MAC 上体验也不是特别好，我更习惯把一些随手记 记在 apple 备忘录上，，试用了 Notion AI ，很好用， 可以满足我随手记，但是过了很久又能快速找到，而且还能帮我整理排版润色，但问题是价格有点贵。
目前已有的工具
ChatGPT plus ，刚好公司提供日本原生 ip 代理，每天高强度使用，主要是问技术问题，
ohmygpt ，用他家用了一年多了，api 稳定 速度快 还国内直连，目前主要用于 bob 插件，翻译 + 润色，因为有了 ChatGPT plus 之后，很多事情就不需要用 api 解决了，
需求
可以使用自定义 api 和 token ，做到像 Notion AI 提供的功能
markdown 支持
免费
web/mac/win/ios/ 多设备支持 + 同步
支持数据隔离，工作个人分开（如果做不到的话那就只存工作相关的， 反正私人的话还有 apple 备忘录）
希望找免费的是因为我希望可以用自己的 chatgpt api token 去处理这些东西，已经为 api 和 chatgpt plus 付费了，不想多花一分钱，不然我就直接上 Notion AI 了]]></summary>

 recently I decided to switch from macOS to a Linux distribution. The reason was partly Apple ending support for my (Intel) MacBook Pro, partly my frustration with the more and more privacy-invasive nature of more mainstream desktop operating systems in the year 2024 AD. For the latter reason, Windows 10 / 11 was not an option for me. I used a new notebook for this endeavor, not my old MBP.
 So, I started out where probably a lot of new users started out, by searching for "most beginner-friendly Linux distro" and ended up with Linux Mint, which as far as I know is a commonly proposed option for new Linux users. After installing it, I ran into issues immediately. Why? Well, my new notebook comes with the a relatively recent Intel chipset and Linux Mint, being based on Ubuntu LTS, was us…]]></summary>

之前做了快 5 年的机器学习算法工程师（ ML/DL/运筹/LLM ），以后准备转型做独立开发者了：）
上个月我恶补了一番前端知识，快速看了下 HTML/CSS/JS ，然后翻了下 Next.js/TailwindCSS/ShadcnUI 的文档。接着用了大概一周多的时间，做了这个网站。
之所以选择这个看起来有些滑稽的主题，是因为我在 ahrefs 上发现“Demon Name Generator”这个关键词的优化难度是 0 ，只需要＞ 0 个外链，就可以进入 Google 的搜索结果前 10 。看起来很适合新手入门，哈哈。
这个项目主要是用来熟悉开发流程和框架基本特性的，咱们的小目标就是：1. 网站上线，2. 进入 Google 搜索结果前 10 。
下一个站准备做一些 AI 相关的工具了，功能还是会尽可能地保持简单，但会争取给用户创造愿意付费使用的价值。
大伙如果有任何建议或想法都可以留言讨论哈，如果你有 ML/DL/AI 算法相关的问题，也可以留言问我，我会尽力帮助解答！]]></summary>

但是现在有这么一个问题需要处理。

有两个异步任务拼在一起的异步任务。
有可能会出现一个成功，一个失败的情况。

这种情况应该如何设计比较合理。

理论上失败的时候是需要知道失败原因并做后续处理的。

我目前的想法是全都失败算失败，不管成功还是失败都算成功，返回数据的同时，返回 code 和 msg 用来处理失败。
然后只有异常的时候才返回失败。

不知道这样是否合理。]]></summary>

关于头盔不是很懂，求推荐一个经济可靠的头盔品牌或者型号！
最好是 1000 以内的（能行吗？）看到抖音上大多数全盔都带着 3-4K 的，对于我来说有些难以接受。

另外好奇， 分配子网的时候一定要平等分吗。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[两年前发过一个帖子  /t/834103，当时虽然说是无公网 IP 几乎抢不到上传（偶尔也有一些零零散散的上传），但是下载还是不受影响的。
现在还是这个黑裙的配置和环境，升级到了 DSM 7.1 和 Transmission 4.0.6 ，依旧没 IPv4 的公网 IP 但有了公网 IPv6。路由器关闭了群晖所在 IP 的 DMZ （其实是分给了另一台机器，路由器是 TP-XDR5430 ，无 upnp/有 DMZ 设置，但只能为一台内网机器开启 DMZ ）
现在出现的问题是：
Transmission 几乎无下载速度，或者下载速度显示只有几 MB/s ，但不管下载速度多少已缓存那里几乎均无变化。然后更诡异的是，我为了测试只随便挂了一个很热的种，文件体积大概 9G 多，挂了一晚上之后进度只显示为 0.4%，但是传输信息那里居然显示已下载 116GB ！且在不断增加中，但是种子信息还是只显示已下载 43.02 MB （应该就是 9.85G x 0.4%这个结果）
请问各位老哥是哪里的设置出了问题嘛？特意看了 PT 站的公告，不禁止 Transmission 这个客户端且是推荐 Transmission 。
之前以为是挂载路径权限的问题，现在也开了 sc-transmission 和 Everyone 的读写权限。]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[某国企，由于在 v 站看了很多关于公司监控软件的帖子，以及公司也给安装了天擎等软件，所以我没敢把直接安装微信，而是选择在虚拟机里安装
最错误的事就是没有提前准备好工作微信，然后个人微信加的对接群是越来越多，我也不想个人的聊天记录被扫描到。
虚拟机里其实并不方便，还好 VMware 提供了 unity 模式（仅限旧版本 VMware 可用，17.5.1 及以下），实现宿主机里直接使用虚拟机里的微信，也有提醒的颜色变化，但是窗口拖动时掉帧极为严重，使用中偶发卡顿，因此我也在寻求更好的解决方案
后来发现了 rdp ，微软家的远程连接。虚拟机里安装的是不忘初心的精简 Windows 专业版，可以支持 rdp ，但是 VMware 配置了固定 IP ，和宿主机网段不在一起，我又更换了 virtualbox 进行远程连接。使用 remoteAPP tool 这个开源软件，将微信应用的连接打包成.rdp 文件，让宿主机进行便捷地连接。
使用体验真的比 unity 模式好多了，拖动有掉帧，但比 unity 好百倍。基本上折腾结束了。]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I used to use DWM before I switched to KDE Plasma because I like having a desktop environment that I don't need to take a lot of time to set up. I also switched because I think graphical user interfaces are often a much easier way of configuring things than editing a configuration file. It's so much easier to change my display configuration with a GUI than xrandr.
 One thing I do miss from DWM is having automatic window tiling. Right now I'm using the krohnkite plugin for KWin which kind of gets the job done but it's not perfect. Instead of the window manager natively tiling windows, the plugin uses KWin's tiling API. I can see windows floating after opening for a short period of time before the plugin arranges it into the correct tile. This goes against the Wayland philosophy of “every frame is perfect.” In contrast, tiling window managers like Sway and Hyprland have windows automatically spawn in the correct location with the right dimensions.
 Since plugins are buggy and not as smooth as native tiling, I think desktop environments should natively support window tiling. I know Cosmic exists, but it has that dreaded Gn*me look.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I was looking at alternative shells to use (currently I use bash for interactive use and dash for /bin/sh), and I wanted to compare their speeds, so I wrote some rough shell scripts and AWK programs to calculate this.
 Each shell runs for i in $(seq 1 1000000); do [ 1 = 1 ]; done 50 times, each time being timed by time within bash (because the format bash uses for time is easy to work with), and these times are all output into a file, and then averaged with AWK.
 here are the results i found:
 bash: real: 1.250020 user: 1.214640 sys: 0.042000 dash: real: 0.527160 user: 0.504100 sys: 0.041380 ksh: real: 0.475920 user: 0.381960 sys: 0.093320 yash: real: 3.265820 user: 1.385340 sys: 1.886700 zsh: real: 1.765720 user: 1.262520 sys: 0.528320 
 and here is a github of all the files if you want to check it out. just a warning, I didn't make this github very friendly for any visitors (i just dumped all the scripts and data there). if there is interest in this for more shells, i could clean it up and make it easy for people to add results for more of them.
 for me, i'm going to be sticking with bash, because its the simplest and fastests out of these (dash is not suitable for interactive use). I was really interested in yash, but after giving it a spin (outside of this testing too), it honestly feels more bloated than bash.

Unfortunately, these challenges can turn a fun experience into a frustrating ordeal, especially when the surrounding systems aren’t quite as reliable as they should be.
Recently, I decided to upgrade my SIM plan on O2, the UK's largest mobile network operator. At the time, I was using a physical SIM card but was intrigued by the idea of switching to an eSIM. eSIMs offer some great benefits, like the ability to use two numbers on a single-slot phone and the added security of not being physically removable, though the latter wasn’t my main concern.

With Synnax, engineers connect to their sensors and actuators, stream telemetry for control and post-processing, and query historical data for analysis. Hardware teams use our platform in areas ranging from firing rocket engines to operating manufacturing lines. Here’s a video: https://youtu.be/OJtVBfRwooA.
Software developers on hardware teams don’t usually have infrastructure to build their custom software on. They have to work with dozens of data acquisition devices to get data into a single database. Oftentimes, they have to use several different solutions to communicate with different devices: LabVIEW for National Instruments hardware, ROS for robotics, and SCADA software for PLCs.

 Since canonical is the linux company that microsoft have the best relation, if they bought it, would it change linux as a whole?

 On Linux, we have so many choices, which is great, and I'm all for it. It's a good thing.
 BUT... IMO there are so many distros out there that are essentially just trash.
 A large percentage of them have only minor changes. They may come with one or two packages installed by default, that you could easily install on any other linux system with a simple "install" command. Maybe they set a wallpaper, or a minor tweak to whatever DE they decide to use, maybe a different splash screen on startup etc...
 They don't truly offer anything unique. Nothing different about the development philosophy, they just make minor changes and slap a bad name on it "Super Fast Extreme Linux". Most of the time, they have terrible support and stability.
 To use an analogy. It's like searching for a product on Amazon, seeing 4 or 5 good versions of the product, and then the rest of the search is just filled with cheap Chinese trash.
 Freedom, choice, and the ability to make whatever you want is a wonderful thing. But IMO, all of the man power, man hours, and human effort would be better spent contributing to existing, unique projects that actually have something to offer. Instead of everyone trying to go there own way, just for the sake of going their own way.
 So if you're starting a project, please consider looking for one that is already out there that is heading in the same direction, and contribute to that. If we consolidated just a little bit, I think the whole community would be better off for it, and have more man power to get things done.
 UPDATE: Some of you seem to think I want to force people to do things and I hate freedom somehow. This is not the case. The post is merely a plea for other people to explore existing projects, to see if they could be happy aligning themselves with said project, in order to make further progress instead of working alone.

        <link href="https://www.v2ex.com/t/1064482#reply8"/>
        <updated>2024-08-12T14:39:48.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[首先，道歉，鞠躬，我错了。我将清空我的屏蔽列表，并且真诚地向所有 block 我的，和被我 block 的用户道歉。
好的，那么，本文描述我曾经的行为，我这么做的原因，以及我未来的改进，和对与我有相同困惑的人的建议。
如果你不需要知道我的心路历程，那么 TLDR: 我将会对所有人更加友善。
我做了什么，得到了什么样的结果
我发布了一条提问 如果申请一个域名指向 127.0.0.1 ，依照法律规定需要备案吗？ ，并且在文末写了“请注意，本提问是在法律规定层面的，任何忽视这一点的一律 block 。从技术层面，流量不经过公网当然不会被检测到”。
这似乎引起了很多用户的不满， @somebody1 说 “楼主好 nb ，不过我先一步把你 block 了。知道为什么吗？谁教你问问题这么强硬的，v2 们欠你的吗？”， @tywtyw2002 说 “#18 根个小孩子计较什么，默默的直接 B 了就好了。回帖还会浪费铜币。PS 。看了下他的帖子 25 届的，中二时期”。
并且，讽刺我的回复有非常多的“感谢”数。
我这样做的原因是什么
本质上，我是希望能收缩讨论的范围（求推荐 windows 笔记本，下面一堆人推荐 macbook ），减少无效讨论。这点相信大家都有体会。
此外，还会有很多糟糕的回应：
一种是毫无价值的低质量回复或劝退，例如“不做就是了”，“做这个干嘛”。
还有一类是“教你做事”，给你回复一些根本不符合现实的建议，或者正常人早就知道的基础知识，例如我上面的提问中有很多人反复提到“改 hosts”。
除此之外还有很多。由于 1.我相信我的提问有价值和可行性（各路由器管理页面有类似做法） 2.我了解大多数基础的计算机网络知识和最新动态 3.我确定这个问题的答案一定是法律层面的。 所以我写下了 “任何忽视这一点的一律 block”。
这类很糟糕的回应，有各种原因，可能是根本没看题目，可能是个性就喜欢跑题，也可能… 我们就不展开了。总之，我个人觉得，
我未来要怎样做
在争论之前，考虑你争论的代价。对所有陌生人保持礼貌，忽视不友善的人，而非与他们争辩。在上面的这个提问中，“任何忽视这一点的一律 block” 就是一种非常激进，非常冒犯的做法。即便回帖的人给我垃圾回复，我又有什么损失呢？但如果让“正常人”发现我在和回复者吵架，这会极大地抑制他们回复的欲望，甚至让我的个人形象受到损失。我个人认为，在公开场合的激进的表态，是非常高风险的。
不要用计算机屏蔽，用你的大脑屏蔽。我曾经认为 Shadow Ban 是非常可恶的发明之一，但现在我明白了，这是妥协，不仅是向上层监管的妥协，也是向下层用户的妥协。看到一个用户非常糟糕，但你不应该 block 他，你应该忽视他，用你的大脑完成 Shadow Ban ，不要将这个过程 Offload 到电脑上。这也可以让你看到目前的环境是怎样的，让你更好地评估，更好地了解这个世界。
做正确的事，但什么是正确的事？正确的事一定是在正确的环境中，正确的话只对正确的人说。更何况，在公开的，与陌生人交互的场景下，我们如何确定什么是正确的？这种时候，用平和的，照顾大多数人的做法，才是正确的做法。
有人会向我提议，为什么不抛弃 V2EX ，你的英文水平已经足够好，你应该在英文社区提问。但我觉得，很多问题是需要中文环境，是中文的使用地区所特有的，比如网站备案。我曾经认为，中文是我的枷锁。我为了这个想法而努力学习英文，当然没有坏处，但中文应当是我的一项技能，是上天的恩赐，让我能够解决更多问题，做更多事。
在之前，"Put on your helmet and keep going forward"，这是我对自己的期待。但现在，我觉得时机还不够成熟。隐藏你的锋芒，把自己分裂成多个不同的形象。向大多数人展示你 "Balanced" 的那一面。稳定的，调和的，平衡的 kkocdko ，会比以往更加优秀，更加强大。]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[2024 ，0805-0811
8 月 4 日是极简时钟 iOS 上架七周年纪念日，我居然都忘了，过了两天才想起来。
从这周开始，又进入了一个新的开发周期。
报名 SHIP-A-TON
周二的时候得知 RevenueCat 开展了一个名为 SHIP-A-TON 的 Hackathon ，基本的规则也很简单，就是提交一个新 App ，只要集成 RevenueCat 的 SDK 就可以。

我犹豫了一天， 周二的晚上报了名。我的参赛作品就是最近在写的新 App ，然而我根本不指望这个 App 能获奖，我只想靠这次机会完成它，与其漫无节奏地开发，不如在一个目标的激励下去步步推进，毕竟 deadline 才是第一生产力。
周三的一整天我没有动手写代码，而是在脑中计划如何写完这个 App 并顺利提交。我算了一下，从周四（ 08-08 ）开始写的话，到比赛的截止日期（ 09-18 ）是 42 天，正好是 6 个星期。于是我就在网上找了一个 Weekly Plan ，改了一下，打印出来。我把每天的工作计划都写上去，希望 6 个星期后能够写满 6 页并顺利提交 App 。四天过去了，我其实并没有严格按照 todo list 去写代码，总是脑子突然冒出一个想法，或者碰到一个优先级更高的任务，就脱轨了。

除此之外，我还采用番茄钟+vlog 的方式来记录这一次的开发过程，除了每天有代码产出，还要有视频产出。我发现这两个方法同时使用的时候，比单独使用番茄钟还会令人更专注，毕竟旁边录着像，就不敢溜号去浏览跟开发无关的内容了。过去四天，每天的工作我都用剪映或者秒剪生成一个 20 秒左右的短视频作为每天的视频产出，打算每七天剪一个长一点的视频，作为开发进度的见证。
小红书的视频没有外链，只能这么分享出来了。

本周学习
首先还是要感谢肘子哥，本周遇到了两个 SwiftData 方面的问题，在他的 Discord 里提问后很快就得到他的解答。另外他的 blog 也是值得反复学习，这周又有几个其他方面的问题，在网上搜索后答案都在他的 blog 里：
避免 SwiftUI 视图的重复计算
SwiftData 中的关系：变化与注意事项
SwiftUI 4.0 的全新导航系统
其他：
Formatting Numbers in SwiftUI，学会了如何在 SwiftUI 的Text中对数字进行格式化
Don't write this code! (use NSCache instead 😌)，一句话就是不要用自己写的字典当做缓存，要用专门的NSCache

生活点滴
看完了《龙之家族》第二季，三颗星
去电影院看了《抓娃娃》，三颗星
读完了《认知驱动》，但没有《认知觉醒》对我的启发和冲击那么大

This is a new service that we're experimenting with that uses PGLite[0], a WASM build of Postgres that runs in the browser. You might remember an earlier WASM build[1] that was around ~30MB. The Electric team [2] have gone one step further and created a complete build of Postgres that’s under 3MB.
Their implementation is technically interesting. Postgres is normally multi-process - each client connection is handed to a child process by the postmaster process. In WASM there’s limited/no support for process forking and threads. Fortunately, Postgres has a relatively unknown built-in “single user mode” [3] primarily designed for bootstrapping a new database and disaster recovery. Single-user mode only supports a minimal cancel REPL, so PGlite adds wire-protocol suppo…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Apple CarPlay and Android Auto are very common nowadays. Almost every modern car you see has both CarPlay and AA. This makes integrating your phone with the car easier because it uses a UI that looks familiar across all cars. 
 CarPlay and AA work with iPhones and Androids, respectively. But what about Linux phones?
 The closest thing you can get to a CarPlay/AA for a Linux phone is by using Waydroid and installing the AA app on it, but that only mirrors the Waydroid subsystem, not the Linux phone OS.
 For Linux phones to take off more, there should be another CarPlay/AA-like system that gives the phone a blank Wayland compositor or X server. Then, an app like KDE Connect can put its own stuff there to give you a car UI that looks like the phone UI.
 Of course, car manufacturers won't implement this because Linux phones are a niche thing and they haven't become mainstream yet.
 What do you guys think? Should what I described above be in all cars, or should we just use AA instead?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[8 月 8 日周四，据知名财经媒体的科技记者马克·古尔曼（ Mark Gurman ）援引知情人士透露，Mac Mini 消费类台式机将经过彻底设计改造，不仅在今年秋季发布时搭载最新的苹果自研 M4 和 M4 Pro 芯片，还会成为苹果公司历史上最小的电脑。
这也将是自 2010 年以来，也就是乔布斯时代以来 Mac Mini 台式机的首次重大设计变革。据称，这款设备将比前代产品在外观上小得多，更接近 Apple TV 机顶盒的大小，被参与开发的工作人员称为“本质上是装在小盒子里的 iPad Pro”。而现有外观已经存在了至少十五年。
有分析称，新款 Mac Mini 不仅将是苹果 Mac 电脑里的最小款，而且也将是世界上最小的台式机电脑，也代表将是最便携的台式机装备。

回到家感觉还是要去问问其他医院，晚上只能先在好医生这种平台问该领域最好的医院医生，大概一次 300 块钱吧，发了详细核磁共振图和情况说明后，那边专家说核磁共振图无法判断出我韧带断裂一半，连续性也不错，如果存在损伤也是很轻微的韧带伤，可以保守治疗，更多怀疑是髌骨一次性错位。并建议去当地其他三甲医院再做一次门诊，我收到回复后一下子懵了，就再去问了几个其他地方三甲的医生（线上），这次问的比较便宜的，89 的和 15 的，给出的回复和上海第六医院的专家差不多结论，更多怀疑是髌骨一次性错位。
于是我第二天白天就去当地另外一家三甲挂了个专家，这次专家看到我的核磁共振给出的结论也是髌骨的可能想更大，韧带没有那么大问题，建议带支具或者打石膏三周再复查，主要注意修养。
回来我和第一家医院联系了一下，告知了一下我去求证其他医生好像结论有点不一样（这个是他让我也去外面问问的），麻烦他再看看核磁共振图，因为我拿到核磁报告的结论其实也没说断裂，医生说他看过了，他从来不看自己医院的报告结论的，直接看核磁共振原图的，对于其他我询问的医生他说不同医生看图水平不同，反正随我，让我自己决定。
我就郁闷了，这样我是直接跑躺上海看吗，这一番折腾实在是太累了。


这里有核磁共振图，看得懂得可以看看，是否真得断一半，需要手术： https://ss.mtywcloud.com/ICCWebClient/Image/Viewer?AllowQuery=0&DicomDirPath=http://jxyy-20230928/oos-cn.ctyunapi.cn/12330400470890351D/2024/08/11/Exam/1e14e482-6617-46b7-adb3-597059254601/Exam/ExamImage/8ab7b4dd-7ad6-479d-8668-4e7ee380bede/DICOMDIR&OrganizationID=12330400470890351D&Anonymous=true&Token=D7208F20387E65952CA34EC168E473BE]]></summary>

以前是放在菜鸟驿站，也是要么自己看自己的取件码自己去货架上拿，要么给店员说他再帮你找。菜鸟驿站至少还能在菜鸟上找到客服电话，在 app 上反馈，现在菜鸟驿站换了老板，叫快递之家。网上都搜不到这个玩意儿。投诉都不知道怎么投诉。
经过：去取快递，没有取件码，让老板帮我拿一下快递，喊了半天没反应，当我空气。最后都对着他吼了，才不情愿的问我手机尾号。感觉他们现在就这样，故意不鸟你，让你尽可能自己动手不要去麻烦他们，甚至有些老人过来他们也不理别人。不到万不得已他动都不动一下。
说实话，快递新规出来过后，我这边的快递代收点并没有更好，反而越来越烂。也不要说互相理解什么的，都一样是打工人，我也没少他一分钱，凭什么服务质量越来越差，不要把底层人民和资本家的利益冲突，变成底层人民和底层人民的利益冲突。]]></summary>

网上查了下发现这数据库是基于 postgres 的，问题是这玩意完全没用过，问老哥们几个问题：
之前服务是 mysql ，数据源也就只有一个，有必要创建多个 schema 吗，还是创建数据库只用 public 就行了。
创建用户啥的流程不是很了解，看网上教程就是先创建用户，再创建数据库并且设置 owner ，但是我设置好之后发现没有权限写入数据，大伙平常使用都是怎么使用的
还有就是 mysql 到 postgres 怎么做数据迁移啊]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So, I have always thought about what if Linux were to become very famous as a desktop OS that it starts coming pre-installed in most of the machine. To put it into perspective, Linux starts enjoying the same fame as Windows. 
 Well, I believe that the OS like Linux mint- that are more beginners-friendly- will start to get pushed ahead. Companies and people will start developing OS that reassembles Windows in beginner friendliness. Eventually, I believe Linux will just become what Windows is today. People will not have to run commands in order to install stuff. Every app will support Linux natively. Sure, on the more deeper level, many things will surely change. But for an everyday user, I believe it will become so beginner friendly that they won't be able to tell windows and Linux apart.
 Of course, more for-tech-savvy OS would enjoy this surge of people but in proportion, not much. And the idea of Linux manifesting Windows is not really a good thing for me.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[10 years ago I began working on Muki, a web-based MIDI and chiptune player which I eventually announced here on HN[0]. It was a fun weekend project.
Over the years I received numerous requests from people that wanted more: more music, more features, more playable formats, you name it.
Eventually I began working on a complete rewrite of the app (this time for real), and, realizing that each year another chiptune or MIDI website went offline, I decided to start archiving them for preservation.
Today, 10 years after the first release, I think it's finally time for the new, nicer version to hit the shelves. It's now called Pixeltune and yes, now you can actually turn down the volume. :)
Hope you like it!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A bit of context: I’ve been “programming” (let’s call it that, even if it’s just changing variable values) since I was a kid. I’ve always liked doing things my way, that is, taking something that already works and modifying it to my liking. I’ve been using Linux for about 7 years, trying out many distributions. At first, I obviously didn’t really understand what it was, so I saw it as “a different system from Windows that runs on my old laptop without any problems.” However, since I’ve always liked computing (I currently study Computer Science), I decided to gradually learn how this “Linux” thing works.
 It all really started one day when I damaged my PC’s motherboard while trying to update the BIOS (I’ve learned from my mistakes). Since I needed a computer, I had to resort to an old office PC that couldn’t run any games and where Windows was too slow. So, I decided to really try and experiment with Linux.
 Since that day, I fell into a rabbit hole that led me to where I am today. For almost 2 years now, I’ve been using Arch Linux (i use arch btw moment) as my daily distribution and OS, and I can say that I simply enjoy Linux. 
 I have a group of friends at university who also use Linux, and it’s curious how, almost unanimously, they use Linux but don’t like tinkering with the system much. They find the idea of spending weeks tweaking configurations to center a bar and add a certain animation boring, but I really enjoy it. I spend hours modifying dotfiles to make the system look the way I want and creating scripts to automate any repetitive task. It’s simply a fun activity for me.
 I really just wanted to share this feeling, as I’ve recently realized how much fun I have simply making my system work the way I want.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[详细可访问 GitHub 地址：vue-copyright-icp-footer。   
项目背景
由于在国内上线网站需要先备案（ ICP 备案 + 公安备案），所以理论上来说，在网页的页脚部分需要放置这两样备案信息。
项目介绍
vue-copyright-icp-footer 是一个风格简洁的以版权、备案（包括 ICP 备案、公安备案）信息为主的页脚。
示例：
 
项目特点
风格简洁。  
ICP 备案、公安备案信息都附有 icon ，辨识度高。  
适配不同的页面长度。无论长页面、短页面，都能保证页脚在页面最底部。实现思路可参考：CSS 将页脚固定在页面底部。  
提供了 flexbox/grid 两种实现方式，可按需选择。 
欢迎意见/建议/批评/吐槽等各种反馈。]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[介绍
项目是 ChatGPT-Next-Web
主要功能是给 ChatGPT-Next-Web 集成了讯飞星火模型的 API 
因为它是前端项目,我是后端开发.想发文纪念下,各位前端大佬不要笑我. 
引发契机
引发契机是我使用一个翻译插件，它用的是 OpenAI 的接口。虽然每天使用的 token 不多，但也在计费。 
为了节省成本，我想到可以用几个国产的 AI 模型来代替进行翻译，这样也不用翻墙。
于是，我选择了讯飞星火，开通了免费的 spark-lite 模型和 spark-pro-128k 模型。
我使用了开源仓库 simple-one-api ，它可以用 OpenAI 的接口形式随机调用这两个模型。
当时这个仓库漏掉了 spark-pro-128k ，我就加上去提了个 PR 。这个仓库很好用，已经涨到 1K star 。

用 Next 改 Next
因为给 simple-one-api 增加了 spark-pro-128k ，我需要本地调试.我就想用 ChatGPT-Next-Web 自定义 OpenAI API 功能，接入 simple-one-api 启动的本地接口进行调用，相当于把 ChatGPT-Next-Web 当验证 APi 的客户端了
我发现 ChatGPT-Next-Web 本身集成了百度、腾讯、同义千问，却没有没有集成讯飞星火.虽然用这种类似代理接口的形式,也可以调通了所有的星火 API 模型.我就想试试把讯飞星火 API 集成进去,就不用代理 api 的形式调用.
之前我也用 Next.js 框架迁移了原有的 Hugo 博客，修修改改也算上线了，ChatGPT-Next-Web 也是用 Next.js 。所以就与我的两个搭档 GitHub Copilot 和 GPT-4 参与贡献。
最终，feature PR 通过了。虽然代码行数不少，有 500+，但这是因为要根据已有规则进行二次开发，需要拷贝已有代码建新的 API 接口文件。
项目里的大佬响应很快，很热心，也很认真对待，一直给反馈，很到位。]]></summary>

内容包括不限于

“你们小区其实不好，难得有人看上，赶紧卖”。
“你们小区炒房团很多的，都在出货，你赶紧卖吧”。
“你房子有缺陷，阳台朝西，很不好，不值钱”。（其实我阳台是南向的）。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A post recently suggested that Linux desktop has a lot of newcomers and Flatpaks are a good way to make a good first impression. Here's a very simple scenario suggesting the exact opposite:
 1- Newcomer installs Linux
 2- They open the GUI app store - that is most likely defaulting to flatpak - and install Steam
 3- They try to add their existing external drive as a Steam library
 4- They can't because sandbox
 Installing Steam and adding your existing library to it is the first thing a vast, vast majority of people they do on a newly installed system. It is not at all a good first impression that the first thing you do on Linux silently fails. No error messages, no indication why you can't add your drive.
 Most people don't know what's a flatpak, they don't know what's a sandbox, at this point they can't even Google for solutions because they don't know what's wrong. They have to:
  
Figure out Steam is installed as a Flatpak
 That Flatpak sandboxes applications
 That they need to punch a hole in the sandbox
 How to do that
  
all to just do something that's seemingly so simple.
 If you have spent any amount of time in Windows forums, I think you'll agree that most people won't be able to or be willing to Google their way out this issue. As a result, we get a flood of posts asking for help in irrelevant Linux communities.
 Unless Flatpaks are completely integrated in the desktop environment, e.g. you get a popup that asks if you want to allow Steam to access that drive when you try to add it, there's no way they're a good default distribution method.

 Everything just works.
 You can use Spiral Linux if you want it pre-configured for you.
 I have it installed on four machines. Regular install with gnome Ran better than any other distro on all of them.
 We're talking performance boosts. I'm not a bench-marker, but I recommend creating a partition and trying it out for yourself on a spare machine.
 I'm finally done distro-hopping.
 Fans ran lighter and computer runs smoother than on Mint or EndeavourOS, I'm going to be honest, I didn't have the patience to install basic Arch, so maybe I'll try that with the archinstall
 I feel like Debian is the place to be right now, and I hope it keeps stable.
 All jokes aside, I plan to contribute back and have joined several mailing lists.
 Upstream really is a dream.
 Thanks everyone who participated to get this place and I hope we can continue to support individuality and collaboration all over the world.

上文帖子： https://www.v2ex.com/t/1062588
周末去 4s 店把上面几家车都试过了。
1.亚洲龙，24 款没试驾，试了 23 款，个人感觉还是体验还是欠佳，纯油版，销售说非常多人买建议我一定要考虑而且说入门低配没得卖，让我选豪华版。
2.凯美瑞，试驾了 9 代双擎运动版，感觉十分我可以给九分，开起来稳稳当当，符合心理预期，而且加上选配其实有点科技感，优惠力度也大，剩下就是那个天幕，真心觉得没必要，谁懂两广夏天真的很晒很热，最起码送我个遮阳帘吧？
3.雅阁，试驾了新款旗舰版，试驾车况良好，一脚油门下去也够爽，估计带了涡轮？不够后面开起来明显感觉有点不是很适应，车价也在预算内。
4.迈腾，中规中矩，确实大气和商务，不过在销售给的落地价真心贵了，超预算了。
目前综合家人和朋友给的意见都是凯美瑞，我自己也偏向选凯美瑞。纯小白，第一辆车所以想来问问 v 友，谈合同有什么技巧可以再压压价格，一般范围在多少？每家销售贷款都做五年还第二年提前，到底有没有坑？还有验车要注意什么？🙏🙏🙏]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[背景
最近一直在用 iOS 的 Safari 上网，发现一些网站密码只存在 LastPass ，但它切换设备要收费，替换它刻不容缓，虽然现在都 2024 年了。
我的需求很简单
抛开安全先不谈，只需要多端同步密码即可，因为有些重要的账号都是需要手机号验证。
我目前密码需要同步的几个端：
Mac + 谷歌浏览器
Ubuntu + 谷歌浏览器
iPhone + Safari 浏览器
Windows + 谷歌浏览器（偶尔用也要有）
安卓 + 谷歌浏览器（基本不用也要有）
实现过程
上网查了资料后，Keepass 满足了我的需求，大概理解了下：
Keepass 的所有密码是存在一个后缀为 kdbx 的数据库加密文件里。
必须有一个正确的主密钥，才能访问和操作 kdbx 内容，主密钥可以是文本密码。
各个端使用 Keepass 兼容的图形软件工具，它们能做到添加、编辑、在网站自动填充密码，本质上就是操作 kdbx 文件。
思路
所以只要在一个端设置账号密码，其他端同步过去，就能实现共用。
也就是实现 kdbx 文件云同步事关键，文件同步我选择使用 OneDrive ，单独申请了个账号，专用存 kdbx 文件，它免费额度有 5G ，根本用不完。
主密钥我用的是一个文本密码，记在了脑子里。
最终的同步方案：
PC + 谷歌浏览器用的 KeepassXC ，它提供浏览器插件，支持识别 URL 写入和填充账号密码。
Mac 和 Windows 有现成的图形化软件。
Ubuntu 我用的是命令行安装，它默认的云文件路径是在 ~/OneDrive ，需要后台运行 onedrive --synchronize 命令才能一直进行同步操作。
手机 iOS 我使用了 KeePassium 和 Strongbox ，最终选择了 Strongbox ，原因是 Strongbox 免费版自动填充效果比较好。
虽然 KeePassium 和 Strongbox 软件自身都集成了 OneDrive 云同步的设置，但本质上还是第三方授权拉 OneDrive 的数据。
我试了下直接用手机装额外的 OneDrive ，直接打开 OneDrive 的文件速度会快一些，也就是说没有用 Strongbox 的云同步功能（ KeePassium 也是一样），而是像打开本地文件一样打开 OneDrive 的文件。
结论
OneDrive 用来同步，需要自己记一下账号密码。
不能丢 kdbx 的主密钥，如果你存的密码很重要，建议你把它当加密钱包一样保存。
目前我都是免费用这几个工具，KeePassium 和 Strongbox 有进阶版收费，但免费版对我来说很够用。
安卓的我用的不多，不过我看大家推荐最多的还是 Keepass2Android ，有需要的可以试一试。
想要实现同款方案的

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[偏技术讨论，或者有合适的成熟产品也可以。
日常偶尔会遇到一些流程很清晰的事情，比如半自动记账，任意一个 app 的账单截图，发给 ocr 提取文字信息，把文字发给 ai 提取成为特定格式的 json ，把 json 发送给记账 API 实现记账。这个事情流程很清晰，而且我也能提供每一步需要的资源或者 api ，实现了跨 app 甚至现实与互联网联动的场景。
类似的场景或者流程有很多，如果有一个流程引擎，通过拖拽加配置实现这样的流程功能是不错的。
我尝试过 apache 的 airflow 、字节的扣子等各种产品，都不是很好用。
大家平时有这样的需求吗，怎么解决的？]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Did you know that Solana uses something called rBPF (Rust Berkeley Packet Filter) to run all its dApps? It's pretty cool tech, but like any powerful magic, it comes with its own set of challenges. 
 Some interesting points:
 1. rBPF is Solana's version of eBPF, originally designed for Linux kernel packet filtering⁠1⁠
 2. It's crucial for running Solana programs, making it a prime target for potential attacks⁠1⁠​
 3. There have been some gnarly bugs in the past, like integer overflows and discrepancies between different execution modes⁠1⁠​
 4. These vulnerabilities can lead to network crashes or even forks - yikes!⁠1⁠
 The Solana team has been patching things up, but it's a reminder that even in the world of magic internet money, we need to stay vigilant. As they say, constant vigilance!
 What do you folks think about the security challenges in blockchain tech? Any other platforms facing similar issues?

 The X11 fix is very easy, and you can find anywhere, but the wayland fix is a bit more finicky, because some of the arguments can change time to time, and I did a script to do that for you!
 X11 fix: 
  xrandr --output NAME_OF_YOUR_OUTPUT --set "Broadcast RGB" "Full" 
 Wayland fix:
 rule on system/etc/udev/rules.d/80-i915.rules
  ACTION=="add", SUBSYSTEM=="module", KERNEL=="i915", RUN+="/usr/local/bin/intel-wayland-fix-full-color" 
 script on /usr/local/bin/intel-wayland-fix-full-color
 ```
 !/bin/bash
 readarray -t proptest_result <<<"$(/usr/bin/proptest -M i915 -D /dev/dri/card0 | grep -E 'Broadcast|Connector')"
 for ((i = 0; i < ${#proptest_result[*]}; i += 2)); do connector=$(echo ${proptest_result[i]} | awk '{print $2}') connector_id=$(echo ${proptest_result[i + 1]} | awk '{print $1}')
 /usr/bin/proptest -M i915 $connector connector $connector_id 1 
 done ```
 Now restart your window manager session and everything should be working

我初步的想法是，接接项目，先活下来，然后做自己的产品，接项目肯定不是长久之计，但是一开始就做产品也没足够的资源和资金来做，失败风险很大。
有想法的可以一起沟通交流，如果你符合以下的条件就更佳了：
1.有资源，有资金的大佬
2.产品或者运营，有一定的行业经验，有创业的想法
有的事情不去尝试就永远没机会，虽然都说创业风险高，但是碌碌无为也是很痛苦的事情，为何不去搏一把呢。期望能够遇到合适的合伙人一起共创辉煌。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[花了一天时间浏览本站的香港开银行卡的攻略，但我更想知道：开香港银行卡的目的究竟是什么？
我目前在读研一，之前工作了两三年，存了二十万，现在这些钱都放在 A 股里。炒股+买基金两三年下来合计亏了大几千，对国内的经济比较悲观，所以不敢再买股票了。这一年多一直在买国债逆回购，年化收益大约 1.8%。
Plan A: 我原本的计划很简单，想去香港办个银行卡，存美元定期，然后再兑换成人民币。因为我认为美元利息高，逻辑上似乎很划算。但实际上，汇率风险很大，尤其是现在美国处于降息周期。即便要做这类投资，直接买国内的美元理财产品就可以了，省去了资金出入的麻烦。
Plan B:  开个香港的银行卡，然后办个香港的证券账户，接着薅一个新用户羊毛，最后炒美股或者买债券。但扪心自问，在 a 股吃瘪并不代表换个环境我我就能赚钱呀。
所以，我迷茫了，还是想去香港开个银行卡（因为要去玩一天），但是没了目的和动力。 
另外，想顺便问一下，香港有什么好玩的地方推荐吗？我打算和一位女同学一起过去（她已经去过一些地方了，比如麦理浩径），恐怕他对电子产品不太感兴趣。  
最后，如果大家对如何处理二十万本金有什么好的理财或投资方式，也欢迎分享。我知道 v 站的朋友在理财方面都有一些"看法"，但我希望大家能分享一些自己已经实践过的、正在做的方式，而不是道听途说的建议。感谢大家的回复，也希望这次能得到比之前其他帖子更务实的答案，为后来的网友提供帮助，不胜感激。]]></summary>

 What do you think are the benefits/drawbacks of going mainstream for Linux or is the definition for Linux going mainstream different? 
 I might be naive in my thinking but I believe going consumer mainstream for linux will cause uproar. By design, to make it popular = less confusion = more streamlined = less choices.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hot take time! I've noticed a lot more people are talking about and trying out Linux due to the hatred of Windows 11, so now more than ever is a critical time to make a good first impression. I'm seeing a lot more videos popping up on my youtube feed of people trying out Linux for the first time, and in my opinion, flatpaks are mature enough to be promoted to Linux noobs as THE way to install software, and these videos would probably end more positively if we did. My daily driver is Debian 12 with almost all my software installed as flatpaks and I pretty much get no issues, everything "just werks tm". 
 Flatpak's best feature is how easy it makes it to install software that's not on the official repos. When I first got into Linux, installing third-party software was my biggest pet peeve. Every time I went to a website, and the Linux install said "add this repo" it made me want to quit almost immediately, because doing this almost always gave me trouble, and I felt as though the more software I installed, the less stable my system got. With flatpaks this issue completely disappears. I can install and uninstall software with ease! With the only exception of course being when a software isn't available as a flatpak.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[My child, 19, is clearly suffering from Internet Gaming Disorder. They are spending all waking moment on an online Roblox capture the flag game with god know who all. They are in a top ranked EECS program, think (Stanford, Berkeley, MIT, Cornell, CMU...) and the grades are not great.
They are not focused on internship, which is about to end, and I don't think they did a good job. I tried to help but they're just not prioritizing the work. When at home they are just spending time on the above game. It's hard for us to decide how much to push and how much to let go, in case it all backfires and makes it worse. I'm worried they are throwing this great educational opportunity away which will impact their entire future life and worse this develops into something even more serious that it already is.
Has anyone else gone through this, personally or for a loved one, and has any suggestions?
Thank you!!

My distribution of choice is CachyOS which is based on Arch Linux, so I looked through the Arch Wiki's page about wireless network configuration. It turns out that I had to enable antenna aggregation for the iwlwifi driver. I added the following line to /etc/modprobe.d/iwlwifi.conf:
  options iwlwifi 11n_disable=8 
 After rebooting my computer, my internet speed become just as fast as it was on Windows. I'm not sure why this isn't the default (at least on Arch Linux).

I wanted some tool to show the size after conversion as well as compare it with original.
I feel Converay tool just does that. It's quick, simple & intuitive
I'm using it on my own for my day-to-day tasks, but if you have any suggestions for future releases - I'm all ears.
Cheers

上网搜了下，发现 outlook 共享邮箱是 Microsoft 365 的功能，官方文档是这样描述这个功能的：当多个用户需要访问同一邮箱（例如公司信息或支持电子邮件地址、接待台或其他可能由多个用户共享的其他功能）时，将使用共享邮箱。 这是否意味其他用户可以访问我的邮箱？
我登陆 Microsoft 365 也没有发现在哪里可以关闭共享
我不清楚这个邮箱账户是什么时候变成共享邮箱的，并且如果不在 outlook 邮件客户端登录，我是没有发现这个账户和其他账户有什么不同。
我的问题是，我的邮箱是通过什么方式变成了共享邮箱？我该怎么将我的邮箱账户从共享邮箱转换为普通邮箱？]]></summary>

现在遇到的问题主要是架构很老了，用的还是 hexo 4.1.1 和 node 12 ，上个月主力电脑挂了之后把文件迁移出来就再也没成功 deploy 过（主要原因）。因此现在有两条路：
继续修旧的架构，继续用 hexo 4.1.1 和 node 12 ，但是报错很多而且现在并没有什么头绪 XD ；
换新的架构，然后把文章和评论都迁移过去。
我个人还是倾向于第二种，所以想请大家推荐一下好用的自托管 blog ，其实有想过换 wordpress ，但毕竟基于 php ； hugo 的话基于 java ，服务器又没这么多资源，所以还是请大家推荐点吧，先谢谢咯 ：）需要能支持 markdown 、能支持 rss 、最好还能对接 waline 的评论组件、基于 mysql 存储数据这样]]></summary>

想给安卓手机重装系统,打算先备份照片和视频,装好系统后再导回来。
最开始我用的是 LocalSend,但因为照片太多,一次全选导致 LocalSend 卡退,少选点的话完全没问题,速度也挺快.
但我想一次全部备份到 Mac,分批选得用手点半天,还要记住上次上传的位置,有点麻烦
用 adb 执行备份
最终用的是 adb （ Android Debug Bridge ）工具,插上数据线,开启调试模式,就像在命令行 mv 文件一样操作丝滑
我的安卓手机是 OPPO,相册目录是 /sdcard/Pictures/Screenshots/。
备份到电脑就用 pull 执行以下操作即可,很稳：
adb pull /sdcard/Pictures/Screenshots/ ./

从电脑导入到手机就用 push
adb push ./* /sdcard/Pictures/Screenshots/ 

手机所有备份总结
微信:用微信自带的备份到电脑
照片视频备份到电脑,使用的是 adb
手机其他文件,就用系统自带的云备份,比如应用,通讯录,备忘录
另外 LocalSend ,偶尔与电脑共享个文件相当好,至少替代微信传输助手]]></summary>

因为没有 aff 所以不会监控所有商品，而且加上也自用，嫌一些大的监控频道太杂乱了什么都会监控，本着不滥监控的原则，会监控一些实用的靠谱的性价比高的呼声比较高的鸡器。纯粹是兴趣爱好。取关频道不会被拉黑封禁，主打一个随缘，取消订阅也欢迎再关注。
目前监控的产品有：
Alice：两刀 vps ，12 刀 vds ，freevm
bagevm：JPsmall tiny 系列 mini 系列
buyvm：2 美元 3.5 美元 存储块
搬瓦工：46 、dc9plan 、ThePlan
CrunchBits：13.69 刀
dmit：36.9 、39.9 、49.9 、spring
netcup：一欧机
fiberstate：独服
spartanhost：西雅图 7950
wap：WarpGlobal ，tw 一刀，广西
yxvm：hkvol sgvol jpvol
我不搞 aff 推广，大部分 mjj 不喜欢监控频道出现 aff 。因为我不是计算机等这类与写代码有关的专业人员，没有技术，也不会监控商家出的新产品。经过这两天观察，监控速度可以的，推送速度与别的监控频道比较了一下，都差不多。
而且 aff 提现有门槛太麻烦，aff 都是利益驱使，产品好用不好用 affman 并不会负责。可能一开始会好用，推广了用的人多了，商家超兽，线路拥堵，也不一定好用了。
如果你也有想监控的商家产品，请把商品链接、配置、价格、优点发给我，我加上去，不会有 aff 推广，放心食用。]]></summary>

有一份不算稳定的工作,月入一万,在家(租的房子)办公.公司合同一年一签,今年签合同前我甚至都担心公司会不会跟我续签,内心恐惧失业.
家庭状况就是我跟我老婆都是来自浙江同一个小县城,存款不够买房,或者说如果极限首付买房连装修都没钱
老婆在亲戚开的淘宝店上班,年平均收入十万.
老妈今年一起过来帮我带娃,
我一直以来的懒散,没有追求,现在的技能水平低下就是苦果,我压根就不敢跳槽,怕失去现在这份工作就再也找不到工作了.
现在在家每天也没什么事情,偶尔有货就写写业务代码,大部分时间还是刷论坛.
今年其实有尝试过做新媒体,拍了一个多月的美食视频,但是短视频平台粉丝勉强过百(包括认识的人).
现在又是在减肥没有再拍视频了.
真的是到了这个年纪自己才开始担心未来,不敢想自己如果失业了,该如何继续生活,车贷还有一年(四千/月,免息两年买的车).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[前提
之前就有胃的问题，最开始是胃炎-胃溃疡-胃炎。 算上这次已经是第四次做胃镜了，从 25 岁左右开始。四次都是普通的，之前是不了解无痛的。而现在是无痛的做不了。
胃从过年开始就有点不舒服，主要是过年喝了点白酒，然后胃病就发作了。后来中间又吃了辣的东西。微辣。没管住嘴，主要还是自己作的吧。
症状
主要是胃上部有烧灼感，饱胀感。最主要还是烧灼感，自己也吃药了。但是一直是反复发作。从 2 月一直到 7 月，中间也去查过幽门，超标了。关键那个医院的医生说之超了一点，不确定是不是要吃要杀。让我做胃镜。我不想做，就吃药，没效果。又换到中医院，让做胃镜，不想做，还是吃药。没啥效果。最后换到市立医院约了胃镜。
过程
7 月份约的胃镜，中间因为感冒，自己害怕做。拖到了上周三去做了。因为胖，医生不建议做麻醉的，就做的普通的，等到做的那天只有两个普通的，其他都是无痛的。另外一个是哺乳期。
整个做的过程就  6 7 分钟。那感受，一根和笔一样粗的管子从你喉咙捅进去。酸爽。
结果
慢性浅表性胃炎，病理检查下周出来。所以约了下周的医生复查。
详细记录 看公众号 或者博客文章。

        <link href="https://www.v2ex.com/t/1064022#reply4"/>
        <updated>2024-08-10T09:45:52.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[怎么做的？
思路很简单，就是把 ollama ，模型（ qwen2 ），还有前端（ChatGPT-Next-Web），想办法打包到了一起。
都是利用的现有项目，没有任何开发的成分。
对于全无开发经验的产品经理来说确实比较痛苦，很幸运的是跑起来了，不枉我将近两天的尝试，和 ChatGPT 的帮助。
下载地址
打包了 qwen2:0.5B 的演示版本，解压缩后点击运行.bat 即可，因为模型非常小，所以绝大多数 Windows 电脑都可以运行，就是比较傻。
链接：https://cloud.189.cn/t/7fEV3qYBjuYz （访问码：wh8g ）
为什么要做这个产品，或者有什么价值
先吹个大一点的牛
Name Story
这个产品的初心，是做一个属于个人，服务个人的，以安全，隐私，可靠性为目标的 AI 产品。
我让 ChatGPT 帮我取了一系列的名字，SecureMind ，ShieldGen ，BanyanAI ，AegisAI ，PrivyBrain 等等。
但首先是这些名字很多都被注册了；
其次想取一个中文名的时候，很难找一个跟英文贴切又亮眼的翻译。
后来我想到了陈奕迅的一首歌，叫《七百年后》，而这首歌的灵感来自于电影《 WALL-E 》，这也是我非常喜欢一部动画片。它们描述了在七百年后的世界，生存，家园，与爱。
所以，我觉得 700AI 是一个好名字，蕴含了这种跨越物质与生死，无惧于时光流逝的情感与文明。（再者，700AI 这个名字也解决了我中英文的苦恼，无论在什么语言当中都很好宣传🙂）
Vision
成为广泛，长期，跨越时代的 AI 企业。
Mission
利用先进的技术与思维，致力于提供安全，隐私，可靠的 AI 产品与服务。力求通过 AI 的广泛应用，改善人类的生活与教育水平，提高生产效率，增强人类应对挑战的能力。
Credo
AI 是下一个时代的操作系统，解决生态与用户交互的问题，我们需要像思考操作系统一样来思考自己的产品。
坚信小规模模型能力的快速提升，坚信推理成本的快速下降，基于这两点，相信本地运行的 AI 的能力会叠速发展，成为一种相当主流的服务形式。
随着 AI 服务的愈加深入，隐私保护的问题愈加突出。
当气候变迁，资源枯竭，能源危机，秩序崩坏，AI 高度压缩的知识与高效的信息处理，会成为文明重建的关键。
再来点实际的
一定要有自己的生意，哪怕再小
来自 X 的大佬 @PengXiao 的忠告，深感认同
这件事非常容易启动
现成的项目很多，尽可能选 MIT license 的，大模型也都是开源的，做起来投入没有那么大。
未来有一定的想象空间
700AI Desktop——Studio——OS——Station （ HW ），有比较明确的演进路线。
未来的计划
当前有稳定工作；
中短期内，只做离线；
会做付费，尽早商业化，（大家也帮忙看看有没有合规风险）；
会努力做渠道推广；
临界点是能养活自己。
欢迎有兴趣的伙伴加我 wx ，共同探讨：R29vZ2xlTWljcm9zb2Z0]]></summary>

顺带一提，在这篇帖子之后 https://v2ex.com/t/1022714 ，我开始尝试驯化自己的推荐系统，利用多个账号来区分不同推荐流，最终得出结论：要想获得优质信息流，一般需要两个账号，一个注重质量，一个用于娱乐，并且应该善用点赞和不感兴趣去让推荐系统朝你想要的方向走。不过最终还是觉得：少接触推荐系统，多搜索才是最有效率的。

A：国内主账号（已有）

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[小弟不才，上班之余用 go 搭建了一套开箱即用的 api 接口框架，主要特点
路由层使用主流了的 gin 框架
db 操作引入了国内比较主流的 gorm
redis 使用了 go-redis ，个人觉得比 redigo 好点儿，主要是有命令方法，可维护性强一些
引入了 zerolog,记录日志，做开发时间长了，感觉没有日志简直就是要命，日志没有 requestId 之类的也很痛，所以在框架中规避了这个痛点，并且日志也区分了业务日志，panic 日志，access 请求日志，以及日志级别
引入了定时任务，便于开发一些定时任务，使用 job 定义定时任务的结构和业务
引入 validator 验证，结合 gin 自带的 shoudbind 相关方法，进一步做了优化，支持自定义提示字段名字，并且支持在 shoudbind 之外使用 validator
使用 google/uuid 生成 requestId,requestId 在日志以及响应 json 结果中提现，支持自定义 requestId 字段名字，如改成 traceId
结构化响应结果，响应结果包含 code 、message 、data 三个字段，也支持自定义响应字段名字,如改成 status 、msg 、result ，另外对 gin 自带的 ctx.JSON 进行了封装，使用 httpx.Ok 或者 http.Error 等
引入了 event 事件，可以对主业务之外的逻辑使用事件方式编写

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[大家好，我是开源图片编辑器的作者，在开发图片编辑器的过程中，因为一些功能无法扩展，出现过一次较大的重构，将整个编辑器改为了插件化的架构，经历过这次重构，规范了编辑器功能的扩展方式，解决了项目里很多重要的问题。
如果你也在做类似的项目，或者对图片编辑器架构比较感兴趣，希望我的经验能给你一点点参考。

项目介绍
项目地址： https://github.com/ikuaitu/vue-fabric-editor
预览： https://ikuaitu.github.io/vue-fabric-editor/
项目中文名称是快图设计，英文名称为技术栈拼接的：vue-fabric-editor ，使用 Vue3 + Fabric.js 开发的开源图片编辑器。
Fabric.js 是业界知名的 Canvas 工具库，它已经 12 岁了，在业界得到了广泛的应用和认可，可用于开发图片编辑、物联网组态、平面设计工具等场景。
本文以介绍插件架构开发经验为主题，不对 Fabric.js 做过多介绍。
项目特点
插件化架构：可通过插件的形式进行扩展，定义快捷键、右键菜单、复用的 API/Event 。
简洁易用：拖拽式设计，让普通人轻松上手操作。
功能完善：PSD 解析、辅助线、历史记录、渐变、自定义字体、裁剪等功能，满足轻量图片编辑需求。

可应用于自媒体/海报设计、平面设计、PPT 、价签设计等场景，以下为项目的实际应用截图。







为什么要做插件化
项目最初使用 vue2 + Fabric.js 开发，通过使用 Vue2 的 Provide/Inject 的 API 方法，将 Fabric.js 的 canvas 对象注入到各个子组件当中。

看起来好像组件各司其职，也符合满足单一职责原则，实际上隐藏着很大的问题。

Recently, on a separate drive, I have started using OpenSuse Tumbleweed, Wireguard, KDE 6.1 and Remmina (for RDP). Working on battery with OpenSuse yesterday I got almost 5 hours, with Win 11 am lucky to get 3, usually 2.5. Pleasantly surprised that Linux is finally better (for me) on battery. Maybe it is the year of the Linux desktop 😆

前提，母机固定 IP 线路为 1Gbps 对等（教育网），测速服务器为 200Mbps 对等（电信）
测速为从虚拟机向公网服务器上传的带宽
固定 IP--Intel 网卡--桥接为 hyperv 虚拟网卡--windows 系统 40Mbps

因为最近硬路由天天死机，我想着换一种方案，结果实测下来每种损失都非常大。但是唯一能勉强跑满的方案实际上也过了非常多道的中转，RealTek 用的是最烂的那个，intel 网卡是 I210-T1
这到底是什么在影响网速，windows 和 ubuntu 之间的差距可以用驱动和开销解释，但是为什么接一道硬件路由器反而带宽变大了
看起来结果上就好像是绕最远路用最垃圾网卡反而带宽最大]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[目前我的个人电子设备主要是两个
笔记本电脑(当前是小米笔记本 pro 15.6 ，大概是个方方的商务本)，重型生产工具，注重性能
iPad Pro ，平板，用于明确区分区别于电脑的场景，便携，终于阅读文档，看视频，以及弥补电脑操作不方便的触屏手指戳戳工作
安卓手机，通讯，看视频，拍照，社交(坚决不买安卓平板代替 iPad ，分工就是要明确，否则就是个大号手机)
我对于这样的分配还是很满意的，但是最近发现逐渐有一段真空场景。起因是我有时候经常会带着笔记本出门，比如看书学习编辑文本，然后又带了个平板，书包就变得又沉又没空间了。然后出去的时候对性能其实没什么特别的要求，所以没必要带这么重的东西折磨自己。
然后我考虑要不要给平板带个键鼠，实际操作我发现平板的键鼠不好用，并且 ipad 没法替代电脑的使用场景。
最终我开始考虑要不要买个轻薄本，就像想当年的 macbook air 那样，不过我有一些担心
轻薄本代替我现在的笔记本真的会减轻我的重量和空间负担吗？
轻薄本的性能差一些也可以接受，不过我平时用笔记本即使写代码浏览网页剪视频的场景也不是很考验极限性能，我需要能接受多差的性能？
同样都是笔记本，和我的重型笔记本使用上会混淆吗？这样我就得在两个笔记本上考虑数据是不是一致的情况了，虽然我有 onedrive ，但是我也不可能把所有东西都放上去同步，以后我可能会有带两个笔记本出门的情况了。
如果要买的话，买什么样的？我有点想买苹果的轻薄，好处是弥补了我操作系统上的空缺，但是很贵，二手的也不便宜吧，和我的初衷有点相违背。同样是 win 本吗？还是考虑 chromebook ？]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have a server running ten hard drives (WD 14TB Red Plus) in hardware RAID 6 mode behind an LSI 9460-16i.
 Last Saturday my lovely weekend got ruined by an unexpected power outage for my production server (if you want to blame - there's no battery on the RAID card and no UPS for the server). The system could no longer mount /dev/mapper/home_crypt which was formatted as btrfs and had 30 TiB worth of data.
 [623.753147] BTRFS error (device dm-0): parent transid verify failed on logical 29520190603264 mirror 1 wanted 393320 found 392664 [623.754750] BTRFS error (device dm-0): parent transid verify failed on logical 29520190603264 mirror 2 wanted 393320 found 392664 [623.754753] BTRFS warning (device dm-0): failed to read log tree [623.774460] BTRFS error (device dm-0): open_ctree failed 
 After spending hours reading the fantastic manuals and the online forums, it appeared to me that the btrfs check --repair option is a dangerous one. Luckily I was still able to run mount -o ro,rescue=all and eventually completed the incremental backup since the last backup.
 My geek friend (senior sysadmin) and I both agreed that I should re-format it as ext4. His justification was that even if I get battery and UPS in place, there's still a chance that these can fail, and that a kernel panic can also potentially trigger the same issue with btrfs. As btrfs has not been endorsed by RHEL yet, he's not buying it for production.
 The whole process took me a few days to fully restore from backup and bring the server back to production.
 Think twice if you plan to use btrfs for your production server.

That was exciting at the time because OpenAI's API calls were still quite expensive for GPT4, and the cost of running it on a book-length PDF would just be prohibitive. In contrast, you could run Llama2 locally on a machine with just a CPU, and it would be extremely slow, but "free" if you had a spare machine lying around.
Well, it's amazing how things have changed since then. Not only have models gotten a lot better, but the latest "low tier" offerings from OpenAI (GPT4o-mini) and Anthropic (Claude3-Haiku) are incredibly cheap and incredibly fast. So cheap and fast, in fact, that you can now break the document up i…]]></summary>

后来 SUNO 被墙了，我还好，其他做歌的小伙伴就头疼了，我就想不如直接写一个 SUNO 国内版得了。
整体分析了下 SUNO 的问题：
无法直接访问：需要科学上网，使用不便。
价格较高：起步价 10 美元/月（约 70 人民币），对许多用户不够友好。
积分过期：每月积分会过期，造成浪费。
免费版限制：SUNO 虽然有免费套餐，但无法用于商用。
然后就对症下药，没日没夜开发上线了 YourMusic.fun ,主要的差异点是：
国内直连：无需科学上网，随时访问，使用体验更佳。
灵活套餐：价格从 1 元起，多种套餐可供选择，满足不同用户需求。
永久积分：专业会员和超级会员积分永不过期，无后顾之忧。
商用支持：所有套餐均支持商用，无需额外费用。
虽然国内也有不少类似的产品在做，但是他们因为是公司，而且还投广告，所以起步就是 68 ，198 这样的套餐，还每个月过期，YourMusic.fun 有 1 元尝鲜，月度套餐也才 10 块，200 开始就永久积分不过期了，尝试在群里一推广，结果没几天就来了几百个用户，半个月就直接破千了。
在 V2EX 上一直看大家推荐自己的产品，我也尝试在这里分享一下我的产品： YourMusic.fun，我们用的是最新的 SUNO V3.5 模型， 而且支持 mp3, wav, video 下载，在线分享；
正在努力开发 extend ， 人声分离，上传音频重唱 这些功能，马上都会推出！
而且我们在研究怎么直接提升 SUNO 作品的音质，让大家可以直接把歌传到网易云认证成音乐人！
体验产品
YourMusic.fun - SUNO 的国内版，AI 音乐创作新体验
如果大家或者朋友有 AI 生成音乐的需求，可以体验一下，真的很好用！ 提前感谢大家的试用和分享！]]></summary>

        <id>https://www.v2ex.com/t/1063920#reply0</id>
        <link href="https://www.v2ex.com/t/1063920#reply0"/>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[起因
起因是自己半年前脑袋一热买了几个 .ai 域名，当时想着做导航站来着，一直没做。
刚开始也总找借口，比如觉得自己之前是在外企搞大数据的，虽然对海外 GA 、GCP/AWS 、Hubspot 这些挺熟，但是没写过前端，讨厌前端切图/一点点调 UI ，没研究看清导航站的前途等等借口。
总是想等到一切都完美，其实也是一种严重的拖延，其实永远等不到完美的时候。
这周末早上在公园边跑步边听播客的时候，听到一个说法说👇
当你要做决定时，就去散步/跑步，因为人在前进时做决定，脑袋会想到往前看，做的决定也会更往前看。
于是终于决定要马上动手，在未动手时，信息永远不足，会看不清，但是行动会带来新的信息，会看得更清。
回家先马上开始写下第一行代码，就拿很多工程师都做的小报童导航站练手。
上线
今天差不多了，先发上线：小报童精选专栏导航站: xiaobot.store

应该是市面上专栏数据最多的小报童导航站了，而且加了搜索和自己精心打的搜索标签，毕竟以前是搞数据的嘛，，，打标签熟门熟路了😝
因为时间很仓促，很多技术栈是刚学的，还有很多不足请大家反馈哈，听劝
比如：
1️⃣ UI 方面，移动端体验还不够好，往下滑专栏太多了，用户想重新搜索得往上滑挺久，应该得加一个直达搜索的地方(还没学会)
2️⃣ 有一些“原价 9999 ，现金 19.9”的坏风气专栏，计划加一个过滤项帮大家按需过滤一下
3️⃣ 一般搜索的时候，都会有按照某些字段排序的需求，比如内容数、更新时间等，还没来得及加上
技术栈
在写代码前，以下很多技术栈自己还完全不会
全栈：Next.js14
Database: Postgresql, ORM Prisma
UI: Tailwind CSS
部署：Vercel
域名解析：Cloudflare
实践下来，这一套是真的快，Vercel&&Cloudflare 真是赛博活佛，代码 merge 到 Github 主分支后，Vercel 直接部署，5min 后最新代码就可以直接访问了。
之前用国内阿里云的 ECS ，得自己写 CI/CD 脚本，每次部署还得花很多时间。。。
除了域名花了点钱，Vercel&&Cloudflare 都完全 free plan 搞起。
站点收录提交
站点提交这个真的完全不 scale 的一个活，每个搜索引擎都得注册、验证、提交 URL ，而且有不少坑，大家可以关注一下👇
而且在提交这点上，国内国外体验差距真的挺大的
国外比较知名就是 GSC(Google Search Console) 和 Bing ，GCS 可以 CNAME 验证站长，很快验证通过，Bing 可以从 GSC 已经验证过的站直接 import （不过不知道为啥，刚刚一直导入失败）
国内百度、搜狗、头条、360 搜索这几个，体验最好的是头条搜索，很快验证通过。百度不知道为啥，文件验证、Meta 验证一直失败，而且和搜狗/360/百度一样，都没有 CNAME 验证。
所以以后每次验证，都得改代码重新部署，有 CNAME 可以不用重新部署这点挺友好。
大家有计划提交国内站点真的注意哈，部署前提前搞好验证文件或者 meta]]></summary>

Here is a 3-minute video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9-WwJk1v5mI, showing how to create an LLM data processor to process videos, build a semantic search for image data, and use it with SQL.
The problem we tackle is that data analysts cannot quickly answer their business questions around unstructured, multimodal data. For example, product teams want to understand user session replay videos to understand the painpoints of using their product.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello HN!
The day has finally come to stop adding features and start sharing what I've been building the last 5-6 months.
It's a bit of CrewAI, OpenDevon, LangFuse/Cloud all in one, providing devs who prefer TypeScript an integrated framework thats provides a lot out of the box to start experimenting and building agents with.
It started after peeking at the LangChain docs a few times and never liking the example code. I began experimenting with automating a simple Jira request from the engineering team to add an index to one of our Google Spanner databases (for context I'm the DevOps/SRE lead for an AdTech company).
It incudes the tooling we're building out to automate processes from a DevOps/SRE perspective, which initially includes a configurable GitLab merge request AI reviewer.
The initial layer above Aider (https://aider.chat/) grew into coding agent and an autonomous agent with LLM-independent function calling with auto-generated function schemas.
And as testing via the CLI became unwieldy soon grew database persistence, tracing, a Web UI and human-in-the-loop functionality.
One of the more interesting additions is the new autonomous agent which generates Python code that can call the available functions.
Using the pyodide library the tool objects are proxied into the Python scope and executed in a WebAssembly sandbox.
As its able to perform multiple calls and validation logic in a single control loop, it can reduce the cost and latency, getting the most out of the frontier LLMs calls with better reasoning.
Benchmark runners for the autonomous agent and coding benchmarks are in the works to get some numbers on the capabilities so far. I'm looking forward to getting back to implementing all the ideas around improving the code and autonomous agents from a metacognitive perspective after spending time on docs, refactorings and tidying up recently.

因为一直在实习,所以对之前简历上的项目很不熟悉了,今年秋招开的格外早,感觉时间只够背背八股和刷下 hot100 了,所以想着能不能去掉简历上之前的两个个人项目,只留实习经历,可以少复习点,怕准备不充分挂在个人项目上(找暑期实习的时候有一次凉了感觉就是因为个人项目讲的不好)
字节的经历是系统架构负责网络监控开发相关,做的事情比较多,感觉比较能讲;腾讯的是偏运维,而且有很长一段时间是在参加部门培训,这一段感觉有点水
还有一段开源经历,参加的是 OSPP(中科院举办的一个开源活动,类似 GSOC,有奖金)但是因为做的比较简单,所以已经删除了

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[3 年前做任务的时候用 MetaMask 创建的 10 个钱包（同一个助记词），做完任务后就丢那没怎么再管过，今天心血来潮导入钱包看了一下，顿时心凉了半截，10 个钱包都被洗劫一空了，连点零头都没有留下。

可以看到，所有钱包里的全部 BNB 都在 243 天前（ 2023-12-10 ）被黑客归集到同一个地址 0xCbA9e65a437b2f7bF65d73FE54edeF6cD569667C ，然后又转入 0x979EDD4f19f6cAe5Cb4237eddBd5bE7799097D34 ，最后转入 OKX 的地址。而从区块链记录来看，我自己当时为了做任务创建钱包和转入 BNB 的时间是 979 天前（ 2021-12-04 ），中间相隔 2 年，几乎没怎么操作过这个钱包。
想不通的点是这个钱包在 2021-12-04 被创建后，几乎就没怎么动过，后来自己都差点忘了这回事。浏览器中的 MetaMask 早就换了登录账号，只有备用的小米手机保持着登录状态，BNB 在里面躺了 2 年才被盗走，而我经常操作的以太坊账户反而没有发生这种情况。完全摸不着头绪，不知道哪个环节出了纰漏。
我个人猜测肯定是助记词泄露了，不然如果单纯某个账户的私钥泄露，应该反推不出来其他账户。
几个线索：
BNB 账户和以太坊账户都在个人同一台电脑上操作过，以太坊那个操作更加活跃，但以太坊账户没被盗
手机上 BNB 账户在备用小米手机的 MetaMask 登录，以太坊账户此前在小米手机登录，后来换到主用的 iPhone 14 上登录
助记词抄在纸上，没有截屏过，几乎不太可能复制粘贴过（但也无法 100% 肯定）
有没有大佬能分析分析到底哪个环节出了纰漏导致被偷了？]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[最近因为 Onedrive 快满了，所以买了腾讯云的 1T 的归档存储资源包。大部分是相机的照片和 raw 文档，所以归档存储就够，基本不会去取回。
因为文件数量多且大，所以最近一直在上传；考虑到 Onedrive 要先下载回来再传到腾讯云上，所以用 rclone 挂载来传输；
rclone sync --metadata --verbose --progress Onedrive:相机备份 tencentcos:fuji-1251178759/photos_bakup

然后前天终于都传完了，上控制台看，感觉使用量没有显示出来有点奇怪（看下图，可以看到 3-7 日很奇怪的是 0 ），但是我觉得反正总量是小于 1T 的，就没有管它；

然后今天忽然就收到邮件，说 1T 的资源包超额了；


上去控制台看，没有呀，总量 700 多 G ，没有超过 1T 呀？

于是找客服提问，
为啥总量没超过，但是显示超额了？
为啥这 2 天控制台显示使用量是 0 ，而且日志下载显示的使用量也是 0 ？

左边是昨天下载的，3-7 日显示 0 ；右边是今天下载的日志，也是 3-7 日显示 0 ；


这里客服发了个提前删除量的介绍，我一开始还以为是 rclone 的 sync ，每一次操作都会去刷新已上传的文件，导致已上传的文件的文件头、属性之类的变更，导致了提前删除量（汗～）

但是也没有解决为啥统计量为 0 的疑问。。。


最后这个“AbortMultipartUpload”的类型，我终于想起来了；是昨天我看到控制台的统计有点奇怪，然后有 2 个文件碎片，于是我就手贱地点了删除。。。。。。

至此，终于搞懂怎么回事了：
就是删掉的 2 个文件碎片=3.2G x 87 天（最低 90 天的归档存储）= 278.4 G
然后它就直接全部在昨天的 1T 的资源包里进行扣除，278.4 + 745.58 刚好就是 1023.98 ，刚好超过了 1T ；
所以各位如果想使用归档存储来备份照片的老哥们，要注意这个问题，即使有文件碎片，也要忍住，90 天后再去点“清空碎片”（无语）；如果你的碎片文件大小很大，x90 天可能费用挺高

然后腾讯云的文档吧，只说到删除文件碎片会有请求费用，但是没说提前删除量的费用；我去搜索了阿里云，也是有“提前删除量”这个概念的，但是文档里也只有很少说明；

最后，3-7 日显示统计量为 0 ，下载日志也是 0 ，他们只承认是展示问题，认为不涉及费用的问题。]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[我们是开发公司，坐标在泰国曼谷，如果你有润或出国工作的想法那这份工作可能会合适你。
公司是初创状态，需要两个核心成员一起和公司发展，岗位技能：后端开发，语言 JAVA 、GO 至少会一种。
有学习精神、热爱代码，如果有梦想的更好(公司不会拿梦想忽悠你，工资还是有的，只有梦想能有更好的创造力，虽然我们现在是开发公司，靠客户吃饭，但也想有自己的产品和理念)，如果没有的话能服从团队决定也可以。
目前还需要两人，要组成一个 5 人左右的核心团队小组。
要求：有大项目工作经验更好，没有也不是特别重要，如果热爱代码和有良好的学习能力更符合初创团队的需求。
待遇：包吃住，环境好，有厨师(不是吃伙食饭，每天吃什么大家一起商量)，来往机票报销。
薪资：如果没有经验，属于实习的话 10K-18K ，有工作经验试用期 20K,正式 25-30K 。这是基础工资，随着能力提升，工资也会有提升，然后项目也会有团队提成。如果不需要包吃住可以加 8K 补助。
关于试用：会先进行一到两次的线上面试，然后线下试用期 15-25 天左右，如果试用未通过，工资+往返机票报销都会给的。
有意向联系 TG(最好带上简历)： https://t.me/roger337788
注：如果您薪资预期 30K+的，请忽略这个帖子，我们公司请不起。]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[前言
入职游戏公司大半个月了，公司是自研自发运营一体一条龙，在其中一个研发工作室的游戏客户端岗位实习。我是民办二本 25 应届生，找了好久都没找到实习，后面现在这家公司 HR 联系到了我，最后拿到了这家公司的 offer ，这是我的第一份实习。
入职前期
前面的时间都是在了解项目源码和工作流，熟悉项目的结构和数据流向，没有说立刻上手就搞开发。
在这期间，我基本都是梳理逻辑，数据走向还没清楚。遇到不懂的我都会去请教组长或者组员，他们真的很好，很热心，很愿意去解答，真的很给力。
入职中期
花了大概一周时间了解近项目后，组长和我面谈，问我在组里怎么样，适不适应，以及未来的规划。
我还挺喜欢组里的氛围的，我告诉组长觉得挺不错的，并且也愿意干下去。组长也给了我一些建议，告诉我这条路如何走。
我简单总结一下他说的，长远目标来说：把现有项目框架吃透，熟悉整体的工作流和业务逻辑，实习生路还很很长，把现在的项目学了，对自己都是有帮助的。
后面他安排了一个组员带我，让我开始接手代码重构，mentor 和组长都说，不懂的话问就行了。
我任务把前面写的代码能封装的都封装起来，mentor 也会问我情况怎么样，我也会去跟他汇报当前的进度，遇到的问题。
他时不时会拿代码重构的那些部分来问我，为什么这块代码这样写，优点是什么，缺点是什么，重构的话应该怎么改怎么封装最合适，我不知道他也会说，也让我在这个过程中也对项目有更近一步的认识。
如今状况
现在也完成了代码重构，组长也开始安排一些小需求和优化给我，我也能慢慢的上手。
这周安排了一个业务逻辑给我，我当时跟策划对的时候也大致了解需求，这个业务逻辑不需要大改，总体逻辑是不变的，入口或者一些小地方需要更改。
我的 mentor 问我做业务做得怎么样，我说目前在尝试着修改，边写边了解业务逻辑，看是否这样做能达到业务需求，然后我的 mentor 和组长听了，都叫停我了。
尝试性编程
他们叫停我了我，然后让我去把数据流向和有关该业务逻辑的都去看一遍，捋清楚需要改什么，不需要改什么，数据怎么传输，传输到哪里去 等等，把这些了解清楚了改。
我当时被否定了还觉得有点难受的，我也没问为什么，就照样做。
后面我问我组长，我大致了解了工作流程，基本逻辑，为什么不能尝试性编程？
组长原话
"你要分清楚场合，对于技术攻关来说，你有个技术点不明白，你尝试是 OK 的；对于业务来说，这个是你写的东西，你需要了解你自己写的东西，知道数据的走向，以及你这个业务的整个逻辑脉络，你都要清楚，如果你尝试性编程，也就是说你还不了解业务逻辑，那么，你就要去梳理它。"
"当策划提出需求的时候，如果你不能把需求拆分出一个又一个的点的时候，说明你还有不明白的地方，这个就是你要去实习的，而尝试性编程，对于你来说就是靠猜，没办法把东西消化成为自己的。"
"我不管做一个框架或者做一个模块，我都要清楚我要的是什么，数据的传输、走向，你的整体是什么，整理里面又需要些什么，然后在慢慢的去扩展这些，我说的这个不是说让你怎么样怎么样，主要是一个思路：你想东西不要只想到一个点，你要想到的是面，这个面里面需要哪些点去组成，这些点又是怎么组成这个面的。"
"对于我这个职位来说，我需要兜住每一个组员写的代码，清楚整个流程走向。而你，则是要养成这个习惯，不说框架有多大，先把你这个业务搞清楚，知道逻辑，知道走向，尝试性编程只会让你一知半解。"
后话
我没见识过啥职场，不知道这正不正常，我真心觉得我组长和整组人都挺好，挺热情的，是我的错觉？]]></summary>

 I wanted to start a discussion on some of the most significant projects currently driving the development of Linux. While there are countless projects contributing to the ecosystem, I've highlighted a few that I believe are particularly impactful. I'd love to hear your thoughts and any additional projects you think should be on this list.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Today is an important day in the Linux Desktop history: A brand new full desktop environment has been born in the form of System76's COSMIC Epoch.
 I tested the Pop!_OS 24.04 LTS Alpha 1 briefly on VirtualBox and honestly for a first alpha its very stable. It also looks good.
 Carl Richell also told me on X that they are planning some Frosted Glass effects for the Alpha 2. 
 The final version of the new DE will undoubtedly look quite different from this. (In terms of polishing.)
 I seriously hope this succeeds and doesn't get killed off like Canonical's Unity.

写了一个程序无限下载给出的 URL 支持多线程可以跑满千兆，PCDN 大哥评论区发个万兆截图
包内有多平台版本，支持 Linux / Windows / macOS 等
使用方式 -t 999 -u URL
-t 是线程数 下载内容不会保存到硬盘请放心多线程
URL 最好是大厂,CDN 网速也比较快,别来刷我们小博客。
大哥们也不要刷海外的 URL ，影响我们翻墙。
实在不行你们去找下载站抓包看看流氓软件的下载地址啊。
默认 .bat 文件里有内置的地址，推荐使用哦

一个是战地一，平时用 ourplay 加速的，进了游戏发现 ea 客户端处于离线状态，而在升级前从来没有这种现象，一直能登进去。
还有一个是 roblox,也是 ourplay 加速，启动时报错：TlsverificationFailed,感觉是 SSL/TLS 证书方面出错。
不知道这两游戏是不是出自同一问题，又或者是破解升级后电脑的设置被更改了？我是一个赛博文盲😅真心不懂。

It is with a very broken and heavy heart that I have to make this announcement. After 8 years, 9 months and 5 days, I am no longer employed by Nova and/or Branch Metrics. 
 Yesterday, August 7th, Branch laid off 100+ employees in a massive layoff across the entire company. Myself, along with Rob, and many others with great talent were affected. 
 As many of you know, and for those that don't know, I worked for Nova for 8 1/2+ years starting back in November 2015. It was one heck of a great, enjoyable ride that I wouldn't trade for the world. 
 I'm not sure what the future holds for me personally, but I see this as an opportunity to move on to something bigger and better. Though with the great experience I had at Nov…]]></summary>

        <link href="https://www.v2ex.com/t/1063618#reply4"/>
        <updated>2024-08-08T15:21:10.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[中午看到一个关于 Twitter 使用的热帖，本来想下班后梳理下再回，结果回不了了于是开了个新主题。
首先声明，这个主题是为了从信息安全的角度讨论如何保护自己和账号，为了避免吵起来最后进水深火热，请勿在此主题内讨论下面这些话题
对绕过 GFW 这一行为的讨论
对反诈等政策的讨论
社会议题
此主题也不讨论使用 Twitter 的目的，无论是涉政、涉黄、加密货币还是其他
请将讨论控制在技术方案本身，不要发散开来。感谢各位的理解和配合
正题：关于正常使用 Twitter 的一些想法
不要使用和国内账号相同、相近的用户名和头像。相信都能理解。也不要用个性化的用户名，最好使用在线工具随机生成一个用户名，然后让 Twitter 自动为你附加数字生成一个不重复的用户名。
不要和其他账号共用邮箱和手机号，建议单独新建一个 proton 的邮箱，并且使用 proton 的加号别名（类似 Gmail ）来注册。如果你之前使用的是+86 的号码或者邮箱与别的账号混用，建议注销账号重新申请。绑定手机号时也改成使用国外手机号码。
如果你的 Twitter 注册得很早，那你可能没有绑定手机，Twitter 似乎也没有强制这一批账号再补上手机绑定。
关于如何获得一个国外手机号码，站内和很多博客都有资料，就不在这里讨论了。
新建 proton 邮箱是为了避免和过去你的其他账号产生关联，使用+号别名是为了尽可能避免某天你又将这个邮箱用于别的账号（当然这是不建议的），那可以祈祷脚本没有把+号别名映射到你真实邮箱地址。
在“设置”——“隐私和安全”里关闭允许通过邮箱和手机查找你的功能
在“设置”——“安全性和账号访问权限”里开启双重身份验证。顺便一提，v2ex 也支持此功能很久了，可以也设置一下
同样是“设置”——“安全性和账号访问权限”里，开启密码重设保护。此设置默认关闭，这导致能够通过你的用户名获得你手机号和邮箱的首尾信息；开启此设置后，如果你需要重置密码，需要输入完整的邮箱名，所以不要忘记注册时使用的邮箱了
如果你不希望别人知道你关注了谁，可以通过创建私密列表来实现类似关注的功能
Twitter 大约从今年 6 月起隐藏了对推文点赞的用户列表，但指定用户的关注列表仍然是可以看到的，并且 circleboom 这样的第三方工具也能够查到关注列表。而用户创建的私密列表是不公开的。
如果你很在意，最好的办法就是只当信息的接收者。
如果你只是看，建议关闭私信功能，避免哪天不小心点到里面的钓鱼链接
无论是什么平台，都不要安装客户端，完全在浏览器内使用。当然，应当使用可信任的浏览器。
不定期修改一下你的用户名：Twitter 有内部 ID 来识别用户，但爬虫不一定拿得到
以上这些想法是基于下面这些出发点：
认为 Twitter 比较可信，也相应利用 Twitter 提供的安全机制保护自己的账号
但也不完全信任 Twitter：这里不讨论 Twitter 是否有内鬼（也请各位不要扩展讨论避免吵起来）。但在内鬼之外，即使 Twitter 有各种安全机制，也难免会因为漏洞导致数据库泄露等安全问题（ 2022 年），因此最好使用单独的邮箱地址
这些工作可能略显繁琐，每个人对信息安全也有自己的理解，很正常。觉得自作多情多此一举的朋友请单独开主题批判我，我无意争吵所以如果有类似话题我也不会回复，谢谢～
不尽之处也欢迎各位讨论和指正。]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Today, I explained SSH keys to a friend on a video call and asked him to send me his public key to add it to my laptop's .ssh/authorized_keys file for access.
 When he tried to connect to my laptop, it showed "Connection refused." I knew this happened because the SSH daemon (sshd) wasn't running, so I started it with systemctl and asked him to try again. The connection was established successfully.
 A few minutes later, he attempted to browse my home directory, looking for some files. To stop him, I decided to stop the sshd service I had started earlier. After stopping the service and checking the status, it showed: "Stopping OpenSSH daemon. Deactivated successfully. Stopped OpenSSH daemon." I thought the SSH connection would be terminated, but my friend on the call told me, "I can still access your system." Upon checking with netstat, the connection was still established.
 So, I want to ask why the session didn’t terminate after stopping sshd. Is this a bug or a feature?
 Can someone please explain what exactly is happening?

最近恰逢键盘坏了，一会不用就会没反应，需要重新插拔一下，也刚好过生日就买一套 VGN 98 prov2 冰淇淋，到了之后发现确实比之前的好敲，还自带几千毫安的电池，体积确实少了很多，只可惜键位没那么多，少了 end 键，打代码的时候不能一键跳到末尾。
听说极地狐的更好用，但看了一下多了几十块，感觉应该差别不大，就买了冰淇淋。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[其实不算是两“周年”，已经两年多了，之前一直很忙没怎么更新，但是想了想，这一篇还是要写。
还记得当初，由于疫情一直待在家，自己觉得不如找点事做，于是就有了这个公众号，最初基本是一天一篇的，后来随着我越来越忙碌，也就是不定时更新了，但是现在仍然有一千多个支持我的朋友，在此先感谢各位。

最近实在是忙碌，马上升大四了，要准备考研，要准备毕业 ...
开端
最初呢我只是想有一个可以分享的平台，当时觉得微信公众号是最合适的，不需要我手动做多少，注册后就可以发文，所以下定决心后立马就开干了，当时将我所知道的一些 Windows 和软件相关的东西都做了个分享，后来随着个人折腾的东西越来越多，这里发的东西也就变多了一些，粉丝也基本上一直在涨。后来，因为开做生信，所以我搭建了个人博客，博客是几经周折，最终确定下来，近一些没有什么大的改动了，使用 hugo 框架+git 版本管理+Vercel 静态部署+Cloudflare DNS 解析，域名也确定在 yuanj.top ，甚至我现在的 Gmail 也是 yuanj.top@gmail.com 。

这些大家都可以参考一下之前的文章 突然发现博客已经一年多了、如何搭建一个不用服务器的，简便的博客？。
实际上，自从有博客之后，我的重心一直在博客上，因为它很自由，一切由我说了算，还记得公众号刚开始发的一些脚本和软件的文章，老是被删，而博客就不会有这些问题，博客上呢生信和随笔偏多，而公众号里都是一些博客上我觉得不错的文章，就把它迁移过来。
转机
公众号的阅读量和关注量上涨最快的是 使用 Linux 三年以来的感受、把私生活放进 Telegram 里 和 抛弃 WSL2 使用 scoop 搭建开发环境，那几个月阅读量一直在几万，而这几篇文章实际上也表明了我如今“折腾主阵地”的变化，以前就是玩玩 Windows 搞搞软件，如今似乎是变“成熟”了，对以前所纠结的东西已经不那么在乎，现在更在乎的是一直精神，比如我用 Arch ，虽然桌面依旧不那么理想，但是我爱上了 KISS 原则，喜欢系统与软件包具有同等地位的包管理器，乐于探索 Linux 更深处的奥秘，这也是这篇文章的主题——公众号文章内容的变化也是我的成长之路，可以说公众号和博客见证了我一步步的成长。
如今
如今，我已经看淡了很多东西，比如 Windows ，需要的时候那便用就是，为什么非要纠结是不是开源、是不是 Linux ？再如 Arch 桌面，桌面有瑕疵很正常，系统和软件都会有 bug ，何必在意那么多？只要它能够带给我想要的，那便是够了。如今我也爱上了一种极简主义精神，我希望很多事可以简简单单的，在学校的桌子我会定时收拾干净，将自己经常用的东西放在手边；手机和电脑里留下那些我需要的便可，这似乎也与 Arch 的理念不谋而合，我只要我需要的。但是我也没到走火入魔的地步，因为我很清楚，有些时候是无法真正做到极简的，所以 Windows 我也照用，即使微软喜欢给用户找不痛快，那又能怎么办？因为我需要用 Endnote 和 Office ，那么 Windows 也是必须的了，这跟 KISS 原则也并不冲突。如今想想当年因为一点点小小的问题就绕很大的弯子去解决，实在是让人贻笑大方。不过我还是坚持为生活做减法，更多的关注我所在意的东西，如今我闲暇时间基本都在 TG ，订阅了几个喜欢的博客和频道，偶尔看看 V2EX 的新帖子，那便是足够了，再者就是看看 YouTube 上关注的视频博主，感觉很惬意，电子阳痿都好了很多，算是在信息爆炸时代的一种挣扎。
之前我一直在 RSS 订阅少数派的 martix 文章，后来取消了，起初我以为他们和我一样，都是热爱一些东西，所以乐于去折腾，但最终目的还是为了干活，为了提高数字生活质量，后来发现 ... 为什么会主动去创造需求？为什么连早起都要单独一个 APP ？总感觉有种折腾到最后不知道为什么而折腾的感觉，当然，个人看法而已~
为什么
其实很少有人问我为什么要写那么多东西，反而是我自己喜欢问我自己，这里写的所有文章都是我自己亲自写的，没有使用任何 AI ，而我也不会去加广告什么的，因为我觉得没必要，正如前文所述，内容的变化也是我的成长之路，而内容输出则是我进步的途径，我希望能将所学分享给更多的人，让他们少走我走过的弯路，我也希望可以让更多的人看到，我始终坚持着自己的执念，并未随着时间的脚步而消散。
我来自甘肃边陲的一个小城镇，我其实并没有很大的追求，我只想坚持我所热爱的事物，并且希望我的坚持不会随着成长而逐渐逝去。正如我爱故乡的黄昏与夕阳，并且一直爱着。


（题外话：西北虽然经济不行，但不至于喝不起水、骑驴上学 ...）
今后
今后我也会继续写，坚持着内容输出，毕竟，总会帮到别人的。
正如苏轼所说：安得广厦千万间，大庇天下寒士俱欢颜！风雨不动安如山。]]></summary>

礼尚往来，是中华民族的传统美德，老一辈人一般会在举行宴席的时候用手写人情簿的方式来记录每一个亲友的礼金。这种方式存在很多弊端，比如人情簿丢失、无法携带在身边、很难搜索到某个人的送人情往来账本录、由于手写原因无法辨认清楚内容等等。
「人情往来账本」致力于记录和管理人情往来中的随礼、礼金、份子钱、送礼、收礼，专业又懂你的人情记账簿，全家人共享账本，多维度查询统计亲友间往来记录。每一份人情都值得人情往来账本。

生成报告，比如不好的代码，安全漏洞等，然后找到这个文件当天的提交人，给提交人和项目主管发邮件。
这个我已经做了一个基于 sonarQube 的，
因为 sonarQube 已经生成在线的报告了，所以我邮件里只写有几个漏洞几个问题，然后贴一个在线地址。
但是领导一拍脑袋非要往 AI 上靠。就是要做一个基于大模型的扫描工具。
就说现在有没有现成的这种 AI 工具了？
没有的话，要怎么做？我能想到的是 openai 的结构化输出，把每个文件作为输入，生成类似 sonarQube 那样的 json 报告，但是吧，项目组内部用的工具，翻墙是不可能翻墙的。那种不知道哪里的小店卖的 API ，也是不敢用的。用开源大模型吧，又担心输出结构不稳定。
ps：版本控制工具只能是 svn ，git 肯定是推不动的。]]></summary>

        <id>https://www.v2ex.com/t/1063582#reply0</id>
        <link href="https://www.v2ex.com/t/1063582#reply0"/>
        <updated>2024-08-08T12:09:55.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[我正在使用 Nebula Graph 数据库，并尝试编写一个查询，使其在遇到特定节点时中断查询链条，并忽略该节点之后的所有关系。举个例子，我有以下图结构：
a -> b -> c -> d -> e

我想从节点 a 开始查询，沿着链条进行，但如果查询遇到节点 c ，应该停止查询，并且不包括 c 到 d 和 d 到 e 的关系。
以下是我的顶点和边的设置：
USE ethereum;

-- 创建地址
INSERT VERTEX IF NOT EXISTS address() VALUES 'a':();
INSERT VERTEX IF NOT EXISTS address() VALUES 'b':();
INSERT VERTEX IF NOT EXISTS address() VALUES 'c':();
INSERT VERTEX IF NOT EXISTS address() VALUES 'd':();
INSERT VERTEX IF NOT EXISTS address() VALUES 'e':();

-- 建立关系
INSERT EDGE erc20_transfer_to (transfer_timestamp, block_no, tx_hash, symbol) VALUES
"a" -> "b":(1622548800, 1234567, "0x123abc", "ETH");

INSERT EDGE erc20_transfer_to (transfer_timestamp, block_no, tx_hash, symbol) VALUES
"b" -> "c":(1622549800, 1234568, "0x456def", "ETH");

INSERT EDGE erc20_transfer_to (transfer_timestamp, block_no, tx_hash, symbol) VALUES
"c" -> "d":(1622550800, 1234569, "0x789ghi", "ETH");

INSERT EDGE erc20_transfer_to (transfer_timestamp, block_no, tx_hash, symbol) VALUES
"d" -> "e":(1622551800, 1234570, "0xabcjkl", "ETH");

我尝试了以下查询：
GO 1 TO 5 STEPS FROM "a" 
OVER erc20_transfer_to
WHERE dst(edge) != "c"
YIELD src(edge) AS src, dst(edge) AS dst, edge AS e

但是结果仍然包括从 d 到 e 的关系：
[:erc20_transfer_to "a"->"b" @0 {block_no: 1234567, symbol: "ETH", transfer_timestamp: 1622548800, tx_hash: "0x123abc"}]
[:erc20_transfer_to "d"->"e" @0 {block_no: 1234570, symbol: "ETH", transfer_timestamp: 1622551800, tx_hash: "0xabcjkl"}]
[:erc20_transfer_to "c"->"d" @0 {block_no: 1234569, symbol: "ETH", transfer_timestamp: 1622550800, tx_hash: "0x789ghi"}]

请问如何修改查询，确保在遇到节点 c 时中断链条，并忽略 c 之后的所有关系？
谢谢大家的帮助！]]></summary>

目前是想借助 GPT 和开源社区帮助自己学习和开发一个 app 。我找到的信息是用 kotlin/java/flutter, 开发工具用 Android Studio 。
现在遇到的问题是：不知道从哪下手，怎么开始。真正想做一个项目时，发现自己有很多地方不明白，比如框架、语言、设计模式... 好像并不是自己在控制台输入一些东西，它就会输出这种编程学习...
所以想请教一下 V 友们，如果我要做这件事是直接从一个开源项目进行修改，还是去把 java/kotlin 的面向对象和语法以及开发框架从头到尾学习一遍，哪个效果会更好？如果是后者的话，有博客/文档/书籍/教程视频推荐吗？前者的话，copilot 或者有什么软件/插件能实现能把整个文件夹塞给 GPT 让他能解释一番的？
想实现的功能：
主页有声音图标的布局
用户交互的播放暂停
无需联网
可组合各种各样的白噪音一起播放
个性化定制时间和组合的"白噪音歌单"
目前找到的开源代码：

怪不得 tiktok 要比 youtube 火，tiktok 的广告是在不同的视频之间插入，不想看直接划过；或者是 up 主在视频中插入的一段广告，观感要好太多了。
可能有人说了，开会员就好了；不过我认为不值得，有这个钱吃顿炸鸡不香吗？而且视频平台这么多，你广告影响了用户体验，我直接转战 tiktok 。
Youtube 平台的广告模式该变了，不然打不过 tiktok 的。]]></summary>

enum struct Status {

struct Student {

    std::size_t age;

结果
li:23
zhao:18

问题
1. Status Get(const std::string& key, Student* value);
2. Student Get(const std::string& key);

在 Java/Python 等语言中，个人更喜欢第 2 种写法；但是 C++ 中，一些项目更倾向于第 1 种写法，为啥呢？这样有什么好处吗？]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[需求是公司内部好几个系统都要连 wireguard 才能访问（之前用的是某国产 webvpn ，不会影响其它程序，非常方便）后面领导说不够安全（听同事说实际原因好像是兼容性不好，有几个系统登不上），换成了 wireguard ，但是 wg 在 iOS 上和大部分 VPN 软件一样会导致所有 APP 走代理，因为公司 VPN 限速 30Mbps ，还有莫名奇妙的审计，经常要开关（公司内网 IP 管理非常混乱，经常直接拿一段公网 IP 当内网 IP （ 1.1.1.1 之类好几个网段在我们这边也是内网，好像是深信服默认的）用，很多需要白名单 IP 的系统也直接部署在公网上），配置不了分流规则。于是想自己写个一个浏览器方便访问公司内网，但研究了很久都是说 webview 不允许拦截流量。有没有 V 友有点子可以分享一下？
想到的点子是自制浏览器解析完域名就自动配置路由分流到 wireguard ，但测试了一下不太行，公司内部服务用了很多钉钉之类的公网 saas ，会导致 ip 乱飘]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[老婆家里两个女儿，老婆是老大，下面还有个妹妹。
小姨子本科毕业三年了，北方某省 3 线城市上班，时而有工作，月薪 4000 ，时而没工作，未婚有男朋友。
我和老婆在北京，有房有娃，月收入 4W ，每月还贷+开销 2.5W-3w 。
生活水平说得过去，压力也挺大。
丈母娘在北京帮我们带娃，每个月给 5k 带娃费。
小姨子几个事迹：
1.经常来北京玩，一年来几次，来这白吃白喝白住不干家务，每次空手来，走的时候从我们家背一包东西走（主要是一些吃的喝的用的，倒也不值钱）。。。
2.往返北京的高铁票总想让她姐给她买，通过各种拐弯抹角的方式暗示她姐帮她买票。
3.总想着让我们在她妈身上花钱，比如她篡夺她妈和她一起去外地旅游，然后把她和她妈的机票截图发个她姐（明示让她姐给她俩买票，因为丈母娘的票我老婆肯定要买的，毕竟在这带孩子，从这里出发的，她这样就把她的票也带上了让她姐一起买）。
4.其实丈母娘也一样，总想着我们多给她这个小女儿花钱，比如通过各种方式让我们给她买东西，她每次走的时候，丈母娘也尽量把我们的好东西（她认为的好东西）塞她包里带走。。。
我是独生子，有点理解不了，她姐已经结婚了，严格来说，她姐的钱也是我的钱，我怎么觉得一个已经工作这么久的人，不应该这样总想着占姐姐的便宜？是我太小气了吗？]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Supercell 的游戏都是养成类游戏，但我发现旗下的《部落冲突》和《荒野乱斗》都有私服，特点是无限金币、无限宝石、英雄、技能、皮肤等全满级，相当于破解版了！
我对此感到非常惊讶，因为在我认知的范围内，没有其他任何一款的联网游戏是有破解版的
我是这些游戏私服的受益者，私服的存在让我以零金钱的成本享受到了游戏的创意和玩法
但我有一些疑问：
私服的存在显然绕过了官方的付费机制，这些游戏的私服存在版权问题吗？
私服是非法游戏吗？个人游玩私服合法吗？
玩家在私服可以免费获得一切，所以必然会减少官服渠道的氪金量，而私服长期存在这个事实，是游戏官方不在意还是无法抵制导致的？]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[大家好，我是前端之虎陈随易。
这是我的个人网站 https://chensuiyi.me。
本文我将分享我自己做独立开发，做产品的一些心得经验。
背景
我做独立开发的时间并不长，截止到现在，大概一年多一点。
第一个上线的独立产品叫做 易待办，是一个 utools 插件，发布于 2023 年 6 月，盈利几千元。

第二个上学的独立产品叫做 fnMap （函数地图），是一个 VSCode 扩展，发布于 2023 年 7 月，盈利几千元。

这是 2023 年抽空做的 2 个独立作品。
到 2024 年开始，我开始全职做独立开发，目前半年过去，也做过很多内容，简单说明下（以下仅列举有盈利的部分）：
编程帮帮队。给技术找项目，给项目找技术。比较麻烦且盈利不多。
随易周刊。在我个人网站可以看到。盈利几千。
自律陪伴群。主要运营半年，发现自律这个事情，不简单，后给自律群的群友免费进 Node.js 学习群。
Node.js 全栈实验指南。目前正在连载中。盈利几千。
开源项目盈利。包括技术方案，付费咨询等。盈利几千。
公众号文章。流量主收益。不到 100 元。
写小说。修仙小伙伴。打赏几十元。
商业推广。盈利几千。
可以看到，在个人副业，独立开发方向上，笔者折腾的事情非常多，也均有盈利，不过都不稳定。
那么，抛开收入不说，在个人创业，独立开发，副业搞钱这个方向上，笔者还是有不少经验踩坑的，以下一一分享。
产品的定义
笔者认为，所谓的 产品，并不必须是一个比较正式的软件，项目，工具。
以上笔者折腾过的内容，我认为，都可以称之为 产品。
凡是能给他人他事，带来帮助和价值的，都可以是自己的 产品。
一个付费课程是产品吗？是的，它能让他人学会一门技术，知识。
一个微信群，每天组织读书会，是产品吗？也是。
做商业推广是产品吗？是的，产品就是自己，这是打造个人 IP 。
那么，在阅读这篇文章之前呢…]]></summary>

We launched on HN in 2020 (https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=22486031) after leaving TrueCar, where we managed a 300 person development team. Our original focus was making staging environments easier with ephemeral environments, but along the way AI applications started to emerge as an important and critical component of distributed applications. As we talked to customers using our original product, we realized we had built the underlying platform needed to address the needs of orchestrating AI applications and infrastructure.

 I installed it, the preloaded sounds are all pretty bad compared to other daws.
 The I tries to install VST plugins for synths, and spends a afternoon on it only to find it to be impossible with manual trail and error with wine and lmms, on a per plugin bases.
 And I gave up, looks like music production is just not there yet even for the next 5 to 6 years.
 Time to dual boot windows. 
 Am I missing something here or is music production on Linux just this bad?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[基于最近减肥一直跑步比较枯燥，想拾起来之前放弃的羽毛球运动，随之产生的一系列问题随笔记录一下
最核心的问题是去哪能找到一块打球的人，搜索了 微信、qq 、微博、包括抖音，或者任何主流的社交媒体好像都没有这个具体能力，基于这个想法，假设我们制作一个相关的 APP ，能实现的功能如下，打造兴趣圈子，《羽毛球》《乒乓球》《足球》《篮球》《游泳》等等吧，这些必须大于一个人才能玩起来的运动，当然可能不局限于运动，主要的特点是本地化，假设我想打羽毛球了，在自己的圈子或者类似于群聊这个形式发一个 xx 时间有人打球嘛，就可以约到有共同爱好的人，而不是去了现场在碰，能不能加我一个这种情况，或者白跑一趟没人一块玩，
假设上述这个核心问题能解决，简单的说这个 APP 有人用，之后一系列衍生的功能，当然还是拿羽毛球举例子，约到人之后，对于这个人的评价，可以借鉴或者类比咸鱼的评价机制，这也就可能衍生出陪练、或者教练这种级别的用户可以拿到陪练或者教练佣金，普通人免费这种，当然比如打完之后觉得这个教练很水可以差评这种，
其二，人找到了，我们去那打球呢，可以有外部接口，比如美团搜索“羽毛球馆”之后的结果，由我们本 APP 的用户评分机制，找到这个兴趣圈子内对这个球馆的打分这种，想比较而言更有参考性
其三、就是可能带来的商业价值，比如球馆入住，运动耗材、运动装备的评价、推荐等等吧，
核心的特点 本地化：任何信息都是本地的
专一化：像上学的实话兴趣小组，大家都是因为一个运动凑的一个圈子，互相学习，但是不会像微信、qq 这种广泛化的即时通讯软件那么“大”
暂时想到这么多吧，可能我不知道有这种 app 或者渠道，欢迎推荐一下，不清楚是不是个有价值的想法，大家可以批评指正一块交流一下，]]></summary>

淘宝租电脑是否靠谱，是否会有不退还押金之类的问题。
以上配置是否能满足需求，我看大部分出租都是这两个型号的 CPU 。是否有什么特殊原因？]]></summary>

隐性跳转实现：
所有输入的域名在用户浏览器地址栏中保持不变，但实际内容从目标 URL 加载。
需要处理的域名除了数字英文，还包含特殊字符（如 emoji 、中文、日文等）。
例如，当用户在地址栏访问 1.aaa.com ，服务器基于 API 查询“1.aaa”指向的页面如“bbb”，则跳转目标 URL 为 ccc.com/bbb ，但是地址栏域名不变仍显示 1.aaa.com 。
其他都实现了，就是这个隐性跳转搞不定，ccc.com 不允许跨域访问，没办法代理它的内容。
技术要求：
服务器端技术：nodejs Nginx pm2
代理目标 URL 是基于 API 指向的页面。]]></summary>

跟女朋友已经认识两年，发现我们有很多的地方都很相似，彼此变得越来越熟悉，我一个眼神，她一个动作，我们就能明白彼此在想什么。上个月刚在广场上求婚成功，她激动的哭了，我也激动的哭了，两年的爱情长跑总算是有了一个结果，下一步就是商量在哪领证，办婚礼，好在两个人达成了共识：不用太铺张，就两家人简简单单的吃个饭就行。
我稍微从床上坐起来了，靠在枕头上，打开手机，奇怪，今天是周末，怎么企业微信多了这么多条信息，本来周末坚决不工作的原则，我点了手机上的叉号，那些消息被一键清除了。又有些后悔，从 app 里点开了，原来是 CTO 和同事们发来了一大段小作文。
上周五经过昏天黑地的加班，终于把省外的一个大项目上线了，这时候公司的几百万钱款终于能到账。这次的项目工期紧张，又是完全没有开发过的领域，基本上每天工作都在十几个小时以上，每天下班公司都没人了，空荡荡的大厅，我把所有的灯一片一片的熄灭，最后锁上大门才放心离开。
经过这次的项目上线，虽然拿不到很高额的奖金，但这次成功上线，这个部门主管位置基本上稳了。来这个公司好几年了，公司的氛围很好，和老员工们早已经打成一片，晚上一起吃加班餐，周末有时候也会聚聚。但是却一直做的是边边角角的工作，始终没有掌握公司的核心业务，我知道，在这个部门里，只有我一个人是新人，只有我资历最浅，领导始终有些不信任我吧。这次的项目上线，我终于能挤进来他们这个圈子里。
很客气的跟领导回了一句：这都是领导指挥的好，我才能在你的英明部署下顺利上线呀，随即就把企微给关了。
打开微信，发现妈妈给我发了好多的照片，他们已经开车到泉州了，上个月我买了一辆车子，本来想着平时代步用的，没想到爸爸却很喜欢我的 SUV,明着说帮我给车子热热身，实际上就是看上我的车了呗。
本来他们已经买好了火车票，要去南方玩一下，爸爸说既然儿子有新车了，那么就跟妈妈一起开车过去吧。我们忙了一辈子了，基本上都在打工，现在该是去体验一下世界，勇闯生活了。
妈妈给我发了好多在平潭拍的照片，看见大海，她就兴奋的不行了，像个小孩子一样：这里的大海怎么这么宽啊，比老家的湖宽了好多，这里的大海怎么这么蓝啊，真好看，就是海鲜吃不惯，没有老家的腊肉好吃。。。
。。。
嘟嘟嘟，嘟嘟嘟，嘟嘟嘟。
沉沉的睡了一觉，突然醒来了。脑袋稍微有些疼，领导打电话来了：你们上周上的什么东西，赶紧给我解决掉！我仔细一想：原来周五的上线出了好多 bug 。
艰难的起床，脚不小心碰到了地上的酒瓶，在地上翻滚，旋转，传递给下一个酒瓶，一个接一个，发出哐哐哐的声音。这一周的工作压力特别大，每天都靠着酒精才能勉强睡几个小时。
把桌子上点的外卖盒子都推到一边，键盘于是从垃圾堆里冒出头了，打开电脑，微信弹出来好多爸妈的消息：我们天天厂里上班这么累，你到底什么时候才能找一个女朋友，结婚生子。这么大人了，还让我们操心?
哒哒哒哒哒，我开始工作了。。。

一直想学一款编译型语言，写了几天 Go
虽然功能能实现 但是在错误处理方面感觉弄的很差
编码方式基本是写小函数然后组成中函数再组成大函数
这种编程方式不知道叫什么，使用 go 的话应该学习什么编程方式？
在体验的这几天里 最难搞的就是错误处理了
第一次接触这类的错误处理方式
好像是说每个可能出错的函数需要返回 error 或 nil
于是我给可能出错的小函数添加了 error 返回值
于是在中函数里调用这些小函数是不是也需要返回这个 error
然后大函数里调用到会返回 error 的中函数就需要返回 error 层层传递叠加
不知道我有没有解释清楚]]></summary>

体验链接：www.tourtally.ai
后台目前用的还是 qwen2 ，后面会慢慢的改为用 openai ，或者研究自己训练模型
工具特点：
的确可以根据地点生成旅游攻略，但是生成后不能完全相信，毕竟现在的 AI 其实真的不能推理的，
比如无法根据远近安排规划，这个是一个非常难解决的问题。但是也有优点，比如可以快速的可以根据自己的要求生成一些旅行攻略，比如，带着老人，喜欢山水这些特点可以生成复合自己的攻略。大模型本身没有其他数据，比如门票数据，公共交通规划这些，后面或者可以通过 RAG 以及一些工程化来解决这些问题，毕竟共同交通本来也有接口
⠀目前工具还是第一版，欢迎大家体验。如有任何建议或意见，欢迎提出！]]></summary>

 As seen in https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/pipewire/pipewire/-/issues/2669 and https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/pipewire/pipewire/-/issues/4115
 The camera's /dev/video file is kept open (without streaming), sadly causing the camera to be powered on what looks to be most devices. For some reason, this completely nullifies the soc power management on modern laptops and can result in increases from 3W to 8W at idle!
 On Intel laptops it's a bit easier to debug because you can see the Cstates in powertop not going low but it also wrecks AMD ones. Some laptops can reach lower cstates, but the camera module wastes a few W anyway. 
 I can't believe this shipped in Ubuntu…]]></summary>

 I hate any Microsoft product (on Linux server), so i might be some sort of "biased."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There are plenty of native, OEM and third-party apps for creating shortcuts; from remapping the Bixby key, Power key double-press/press-and-hold, double/triple tap device back, One Hand Operations+, etc. And there are some famous (most of them deprecated) gesture apps, like GMD Gesture Controls, Air Gestures, and many others.
 I'm really interested in optimizing productivity using these kinds of shortcuts. But maybe I just don't use my phone enough, or I don't have a lot of apps that I use very regularly. Even my home screen is kept clean with minimal apps (I usually use search to get to what I need).
 So, looking for some ideas and inspiration, what do you guys assign to your shortcuts on your device?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[目前人在国内和几个国家之间不定期旅居, 收入是外币, 想开一个离岸人民币账户来解决国内换汇限制问题
需求方面主要是希望以下几点, 不要求全部满足, 但最好集中 1-2 家银行上
账户持有成本低 (可以接受长期存 5w 港币或等值免管理费, 50w 之类的就算了)
储蓄或者信用卡可以绑定 google pay 和国内的支付宝/微信
存款利率高 (高=比国内高)
有看过一些香港银行 但好像开户要求很多?
求大佬指点
------------
关于为什么不存国内:
进来容易出去难, 怕以后变欢乐豆
关于为什么是离岸人民币:
美元最近汇率不太稳定, 感觉会贬值很多
关于为什么不使用现有境外银行账户:
其实也不是不用, 但现有这些卡国内消费很多时候手续费太高不划算]]></summary>

 I live in a poor country with a bad economy, so people try to economize when they need to buy new hardware always when it's possible. This need to economize in the last 2 decades made people actively search for Linux notebooks because they are usually ~30% cheaper than the same device shipped with windows. And what's the problem with it? Well, the way how tech companies treated Linux in the past 20 years.
 From 2000 to 2015 approximately most companies followed a tendency of using Linux to create their own operational systems. But most o…]]></summary>

然后有其他希捷的硬盘就换上了电路板开始转了但是肯定不出盘,查了下要买同款的电路板再移植旧版的 rom,已经买到了,网上这些好像也没人买我都看销量 0,好像硬件级维修的分享技术也都是保密的,估计这就是维修费贵的原因.
现在的想法是换上好的电路板再用编程器把坏的 rom 导出来写到新的里面去,直接用夹子,我也没有热风枪,网上那些都是吹下来再换新的上面,问了 GPT 是可行的,但是我找不到一些案例?也不想寄修,GPT 都提醒我维修价格可能比较高昂,因为之前寄修过东西费用接受不了,维修的直接给我板子上剌了一刀惨痛教训.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I wanted to show you something I was hacking on for the last few weeks.
I tired of sharing screen via Google Meet with 1-hour limitation, with Zoom and 40-minute limitation, etc. With paid Slack subscription. And often times I just needed to screenshare with no audio.
So I ended up with my own solution - no registration, low memory, low CPU, low tek 1 fps encrypted screen sharing. Currently sharing only the main screen (good for laptop users).
It's very raw in terms of infrastructure, since I'm not counting bytes (yikes!), everything works on my own dedicated server. But the service itself has been tested, we've been sharing screens for countless hours. All sessions last for 48 hours, then it gets removed with all remaining info.
Every new frame replaces the other, and everything is end-to-end encrypted so even server owners and operators won't be able to see what are you sharing.
There is also no tracking, except the main page - and I use my own analytics. Sessions are not getting tracked and never will be, and observability currently is not in place.
Again, this is a true one-person side hacking project I hope (but I have serious doubts) I might need to scale if it's getting traction to support more users.

 i am using linux since debian 3 times but i am not working in the it field and i am just a regular joe who uses linux because i like it. not a technical person myself.
 my question is: 
 as a guy who uses debian 12 and ubuntu 20.04 and windows, how useable is exfat in debian and ubuntu 20.04?
 can i create a exfat partition in linux? i know about vfat but how do i create a exfat partition?
 are there any things i have to know before using exfat on linux? i would use it on a usb stick to transfer files over 4gbyte to windows.

最近项目赶进度，想下了班回家继续办公。于是便跟公司运维要了公司 VPN ，运维那边给开了账号之后，让我安装 EasyConnect 这个软件。我安装完成功登录之后，发现公司内部的一些服务还是无法访问。于是询问运维，运维告知，即使登录成功，也不是全部服务都能访问的。还需要配置指定的 IP 和端口，才能访问指定的服务。但是公司规定，有些端口不给开。于是我让运维把我电脑的 5900 （ Mac 远程桌面端口）和 22 （ SSH 端口）打开，我连接到我自己的电脑来办公。开完之后，问题就来了，目前我用手机远程桌面和 SSH 都是正常的。但是我用电脑就连接不上，在网络方面，我手机和电脑的唯一区别应该就是，我电脑开了代理，用的是 Stash 。我猜测可能是代理的问题，但是我把代理软件退出之后，还是连接不上。请大佬帮忙看看是什么问题，应该怎么排查问题？我把 Stash 的配置也贴上了。Stash 的配置情况：Version 2.6.0 / 规则模式 / 办公室的电脑 IP 和公司 VPN 服务器的 IP 都设置的直连。]]></summary>

本来看中了领克 07 ，因为价格算是比较合理（顶配 18W ）而且内饰什么的都感觉挺好看的，顶配有 HUD 而且 4 个座椅都带按摩加热通风，带家人一起出去的话坐起来也比较舒服（目前只看轿车，不太喜欢 SUV ）。
但看了好几个帖子（再加上有人建议）都说家里有充电桩的话不如买纯电，而我也确实没什么自驾的需求。但我还是有几个疑虑：
1. 续航问题，开得多了里程会不会打折？
2. 价格问题，纯电一般都会比混动要贵一些。
3. 寿命问题，五六年后想换车纯电是不是不太好卖？
还是想听听 V 友们的意见，如果推荐纯电的话最好能顺便推荐一下车型，谢谢。]]></summary>

不信？
看这个文档： https://developer.apple.com/documentation/avfoundation/avcapturephotobracketsettings
文档里的例子

let settings = AVCapturePhotoBracketSettings(format: nil, rawPixelFormatType: rawFormat, bracketedSettings: bracketedStillImageSettings)

然而例子下面的构造函数文档，根本没这个构造方法。
也就是说，人类在 xcode 里试一试，就知道这个例子是个幌子，骗 AI 用的，真的方法得看下面的构造函数文档。
而且这样的情况，在 apple 的文档里，到处都是。
Apple 真是个负责任的大企业，为 AI 危机做好了万全的准备，点赞。]]></summary>

 First Linux Mint recently switched to Ubuntu's HWE kernels so they will be following Ubuntu kernel releases, so the problems caused by Linux Mint shipping with old kernels on newer hardware is mostly resolved, but if they switched to Debian base, they will be stuck on old kernel until the next release 
 Also Linux Mint is known to be one of these "Just Works" distros, so switching to Debian will make Mint lose a lot of these under the hood improveme…]]></summary>

我目前想了几种方法：
1. 自签 IP 证书：
浏览器弹不信任是小事，就是有时候编程请求 api 的时候直接就因为 https 校验失败就报错了。
2. 使用实际持有的域名
2.1 把域名解析到本地 IP：每个网络的本地网络环境都不一样，把域名解析到一个未知的 IP 地址感觉不太好。
2.2 在本地 DNS 把域名解析到局域网
要求每台机器都修改 hosts 或 DNS 服务器，有些麻烦。
那看来就真的没办法了吗]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[方案概述
在 macOS 中启动 Linux 虚拟机，通过额外的 usb 蓝牙适配器连接耳机，并在 macOS 中通过 BlackHole 工具把 macbook 的音频输出流影射到 Linux 中的音频输入

详细说明 LDAC 协议的技术优势
LDAC （ Low Latency Audio Codec ）是索尼开发的一种高分辨率音频编解码器，旨在通过蓝牙传输高品质音频。其主要优势包括：
高传输速率：LDAC 支持高达 990 kbps 的传输速率，相比之下，SBC 的最高速率仅为 328 kbps ，AAC 为 250 kbps ，aptX 为 352 kbps 。更高的传输速率意味着可以传输更多的音频数据，从而提高音质。
低延迟：LDAC 在保持高音质的同时，还能提供较低的延迟，使其适用于观看视频和玩游戏等需要同步音频和视频的场景。
高分辨率音频支持：LDAC 能够支持高达 24bit/96kHz 的高分辨率音频传输，确保音频保真度。
比较 LDAC 与其他蓝牙音频编解码器的性能差异
在选择蓝牙音频编解码器时，了解各个编解码器的性能差异是非常重要的。以下是 LDAC 与其他常见编解码器的对比：
SBC：
传输速率：最高 328 kbps
音质：一般
延迟：较高
使用场景：基础音频传输
AAC：
传输速率：最高 250 kbps
音质：中等
延迟：中等
使用场景：适用于 iOS 设备
aptX：
传输速率：最高 352 kbps
音质：中等偏上
延迟：较低
使用场景：适用于 Android 设备
LDAC：
传输速率：最高 990 kbps
音质：高

        <id>https://www.v2ex.com/t/1063023#reply18</id>
        <link href="https://www.v2ex.com/t/1063023#reply18"/>
        <updated>2024-08-06T11:50:21.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[背景
手里有一些零零散散的工作。都是用 Python 不同脚本完成
可以抽象的、简单的类比成，就例如 PDF 转换、分割、合并等操作。
（只是说可以这么理解，实际就是不同的任务，不同脚本执行罢了）
虽然我已经将相关脚本转换为一个脚本，从命令行就能调用。
但是总归还是有点繁琐（包括每次各种路径、参数等设置）
所以如果用一个网页版，点击就操作不是降低工作量了？
想法
这理论上应该不难吧，这肯定不难！
其实就是网页上，放置一些按钮，点击不同按钮执行不同的脚本罢了
通过和 GPT4 对话，很快的就用 Flask 实现了最小单元的功能。
就是页面上两个按钮，上传文件再下载文件，这并不困难。
但是问题是「太丑了」，具体的我做了挺多尝试
1 、直接让 GPT 发挥 ❎
我尝试过，让他美化页面，但是完全让 GPT 自己去规划，结果和想要的天差地别。
并且，虽然我不是专业的前端，但是我也能看出来，他写出来的 html 代码，是机器不规范的。
并且多交流几轮，可能每次返回的代码，都和之前的差太多。有时候突然样式全部没有了。
所以如果纯交给 GPT ，我觉得解决肯定能解决，但是返回的页面，我感觉比大学生作业都简陋。
2 、告诉 GPT 怎么写 ❎❎
我再尝试，和他描述清楚，需要几个几个按钮，都在哪里。
很遗憾，这样更不行，GPT 似乎很难完全理解你（个人感觉如果我交代事情，会尽可能说的比较详细）
而且调整样式，似乎用文字也很难描述
3 、画个原型图给 GPT ❎❎❎
又尝试，把我想要的文本、按钮，大概放在页面的什么位置。
在白板上画好，给 GPT4 ，结果依旧是十分崩溃的
4 、直接给目标页面给 GPT ❎❎❎❎
实在受不了了，我直接找了几个我期望实现的页面，发给 GPT 让他仿照着给我一个可以实现类似效果的代码。
然后我再魔改，因为之前搭建个人 wiki 或者 blog ，找个模板爆改还是可以的。
具体的，我很难描述，大家看图吧，下面是我让他实现的目标页面（想着先来个简单的）

下面是 GPT4 返回代码的效果

怎么说呢，就问你有没有实现把，理论上我只要用 flask 给每个按钮的功能绑定一下，就完事了
但这玩意吧，我都不好意思拿出来
5 、自己学吧
自己搜了些，html 的布局教程，怎么说呢，到不说跨技术栈如隔山。
就是什么 grid ，container 什么的，我能大概明白是啥，但让我从 0 开始写，我很难写出来。
6 、其他拖拉拽的在线零代码工具
感觉是图一乐
疑问
现在的疑问是
1 、我的方向应该没错吧，我觉得这么简单的一个页面的设计（最多加一个使用说明页面），用不到什么 vue/react 等，就 html+css 就完全 ok 了把
2 、像这种，单个页面，没有复杂设计，就是一个 header （上面几个按钮），然后中间是一些文本、按钮的排列（这里的排列希望能美观一些，我可以自己在纸上画出来）有没有什么比较好用的工具生成 html 和 css 。或者是比较好的教程，可以快速上手的？]]></summary>

 And on top of all that, google seems to be reinventing the wheel too much, and changing the standards really often. Don't even get me started on the design guidelines, which often aren't followed by the Google-made apps
 There are so many drastic changes with layout of the UI, APIs like the filesystem behavior and so on, and that causes huge compatibility issues with older apps and cross-version support in general, and also confuses the developers
 Again, I might be exaggerating, but that's what I feel about the recent updates

 So I downloaded 2014 Arch ISO... Upon booting the VM... weird, no AIF there.
 Then it hit me... Arch removed the AIF in 2012. 
 I must have installed Arch for the first time somewhere back in mid 2010 to early 2011.
 But... My actual first time using Linux was in mid 2009. With Kubuntu 8.10.
 After that just kept trying new distros off and on... even tried some BSDs... (Who remembers PC-BSD 8.0 Hubble?)
 And in 2024 I switched away from Windows for good.
 Man... its been a fun 15 years. Time flies.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I always prefer native installing apps (I use Debian based OS so deb packages). But lately so many applications are Appimage based and some Flatpacks. I don't mind using them but my god their sizes are big. Many apps are to the point and work well (ksnip for example). 
 But how do they take a 4mb app and make it 1gb appimage? Have the developers figured out how to store their own data without having to use cloud storage? (Just put the data into Appimage & distribute...when needed just use the backdoor in the Appimage & retrieve)
 I mean think about it, Debian ISO is about 700mb. and a 4MB snapshot utility (ksnip) became 1434MB, that is almost 2 operating systems + snapshot utility worth of storage.

What exactly is different about this compared to the regular c standard, and what does it have to do with Linux/how the kernel was written?
 I've been using Linux for awhile but am still completely new to the whole stuff, and have very little experience in programming.
 Here is where I read this from and you can find what I am referencing there at the bottom of the first reply, he wrote quite a bit.
 https://stackoverflow.com/questions/17206568/what-is-the-difference-between-c-c99-ansi-c-and-gnu-c
 I hope this isn't too complicated to explain and don't want to trouble anyone who might have to explain a lot, but I am generally curious.
 Thank you!

 STORY TIME, SKIP THIS IF YOU WANT
 My first foray into Linux transition - namely installing AntiX on an old Chromebook to try out Linux for the first time - went pretty poorly, and a good chunk of it was my fault. I had to crack my system's BIOS with a guide I found online just to install Linux, which went surprisingly well, but still left me a bit nervous. Nevertheless, with that hurdle out of the way, I installed AntiX. I even used it for an hour or two, and it was…]]></summary>

The goal is to make flying as easy as driving a car—while maintaining a high bar for safety. Here’s a video that shows a bit of our hardware and quite a bit of our software: https://youtu.be/PGJUGUceu8A
In the US, trips that are 50-300 miles are almost all done by car because that distance is too short for commercial airlines and too far for public transportation.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[考虑到维持真空管的真空需要消耗大量的电能，保证管道的气密性又需要巨大的成本，那么是否可以降低真空度和气密性的要求，使用一种车头加热车头前方的空气使其密度降低来减少阻力的方法。
具体的操作方式，管道还是管道，但是不再要求气密性，也不抽真空，管道的壁上打一定数量的孔，由火车头不断地加热火车前方管道中的气体，使其暂时的密度降低，从孔中排出管道
干净的空气对激光的吸收非常少，因此干净的空气不能被激光很好的加热，在火车头上安装雾化或者什么其他的东西，使空气被染色，可以被激光加热，同时控制激光的功率，使其只加热车头前方不远处的空气

我的需求是：
只使用一个遥控器（要么电视机的、要么 IPTV 盒子的，或者有其他方案也行）
操作电视开关机
电视机 HDMI 信号能自动切换到盒子（因为电视机上还接了 Apple TV 和 XBox 等其他设备）
这个有办法做到么？]]></summary>

However, these kinds of pathfinding algorithms really need complex terrain/mazes with interesting obstructions to showcase what they can do and how they work. So, I started thinking about how I could generate cool and diverse random "mazes" (they aren't really mazes, but I'm not sure what the best term is). I got a bit carried away thinking of lots of different cool ways to generate these mazes, such as cellular automata, fractals, Fourier transforms, etc.
Then it turned out that many of the generated mazes weren't actually solvable, so I spent some time coming up with various strategies to test and vali…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[前言
最近发布了一款支持 IOC 容器的 Vue3 框架：Zova。与以往的 OOP 或者 Class 方案不同，Zova 在界面交互层面仍然采用 Setup 语法，仅仅在业务层面引入 IOC 容器。IOC 容器犹如一把钥匙，为我们打开了业务工程化的大门，允许我们探索更多工程化方面的设计和能力。有网友提出一个非常好的建议：可否提供一些业务场景，说明有哪些是 Class 可做而 Composable 做不了的，这样才更有说服力。
首先说明一点，其实没有哪些业务需求是这个能做而那个不能做的。不同的编程范式带来的是不同的代码风格，不同的编程体验，从不同的路径指向开发效率和代码可维护性方面的评估。因此，最终根据用户自身的偏好和业务实际需求而定。
那么，在这里，我们就针对这个话题如何为路由 Query 参数标注类型为例，看看 Composable 和 IOC 容器的代码风格究竟有什么不同。
需求说明
这里有一个页面组件 User ，可以通过 Query 传递三个参数：
参数名
类型
缺省值




id
number
0


name
string
''


married
boolean
false


Composable：原生
1. 访问页面
const router = useRouter();
router.push({
  path: '/test/demo/user',
  query: {
    id: 1,
    name: 'kevin',
    married: false.toString(),
  },
});

从 Typescript 类型的角度来看，这段代码有以下两个问题：
path：没有类型约束和智能提示。这会存在以下三个隐患：
记不住：如果路径较长，或者单词较复杂，就记不住路径，需要从源文件查找
写错了：如果不小心写错了，没有提示，只有到实际…]]></summary>

简介: 使用 YouTube 官方 api, 在命令行中操作 YouTube 资源, 例如上传视频, 点赞, 评论和添加到 playlist 等等.
最初的想法是做一个 AI 时代的锄头, 帮助大家 AI 淘金, 比如利用 AI 自动生成视频并自动上传到 YouTube 上. 现在已经差不多实现了我最初设想的所有功能吧, 我也在 YouTube 上做了个 POC: words-everyday, 已经全自动更新有一段时间了, 这个 YouTube Channel 上的几乎所有资源/操作通过 yutu🐰 自动完成的, 包括创建 playlist, 生成视频(这个需要自己实现), 上传视频, 添加视频到 playlist 等, 最近还会把上传视频后自动添加评论的流程也实现.
对 Golang 的掌握从一开始只会纸上谈兵, 到现在也算是初入门径了. 不过除了开发本身的知识, 还学习并实现了一个 tag 自动打出可执行文件创建 release, 打出 docker image 推到 ghcr.io, 自动创建 winget manifests 和 pr, 这样就可以通过 winget install yutu 来安装. 
代码本身的逻辑也比较简单, 有兴趣学习 Golang 的小伙伴可以试试读下源码, 我认为除了认证这块的逻辑稍微复杂点, 其它都很清晰一致, 所有的业务逻辑, 测试和流水线都在代码仓库里.
因为 homebrew🍻 最少需要 75 颗🌟才能上架, 非常欢迎大家 star🌟, issur❓ 和 pr👅. 祝大家和我都早日发财🤑!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[我所发表的暴论都为这样的论点服务：
基础设施的去中心化是建设更健康的互联网基建生态的必由之路
今天病态的互联网基建生态是三大运营商自己都未必想要的实际负担沉重的垄断地位带来的
持有 ASN 和 IPv6 地址块的成本越来越低，企业成为互联网的真正一员已无先前那般代价高昂
IPv6 覆盖度和企业持有 ASN 和 IPv6 地址块的倾向之间是相辅相成的，能够顺着 IPv6 部署的政治正确“左脚踩右脚上天”
省间流量结算，听上去好像不是什么好事。但对于互联网基建生态，省间流量结算是一剂良药：
因为省间流量结算，各地运营商分公司会倾向于将流量终结在本地网络内，而非流向那些更发达城市的超大规模的中心机房
各地运营商分公司会因为省间流量结算而停止靠吸发达地区网络资源血弄的不可持续的营销策略，避免互联网基建生态进一步恶化
出于运营商分公司将流量终结在本地网络内的意愿，他们可能将带宽分级售卖以吸引内容供应商购买更便宜的本地大带宽网络资源，如此可达成运营商和内容供应商的相互成就，运营商分公司在不劣化本地用户的网络体验的情况下节约了骨干网带宽，内容供应商得到了优质廉价的本地带宽用于更好服务本地互联网用户
省间流量结算不仅逼迫运营商分公司作出改变，也会迫使大型内容供应商在更多地区建设更多边缘机房用于就近终结互联网流量
PCDN 也会随着内容供应商有遍布全国的价格合适的大带宽本地网络资源而被终结
这一计，如果能够如我所说的那样发展，能够解决当下互联网基建生态的诸多顽疾。但现实没有如果，我们只能干看，但愿能朝着这个方向发展吧。
要是现实变成运营商分公司和内容供应商比谁先因为省间结算绷不住而向对方妥协，那就惨了。]]></summary>

此外云开发也不要求本地机器的性能，把一些重算力的任务放在服务器端进行，还能提高效率（开发效率和能源效率）。如果拿笔记本开发，即使设备丢了，只要及时登出会话，也不会造成数据泄露。

这是苏州最大的三甲医院检查结果
然后上周我又去了另一家三甲医院，该医院在各种名单里，都位于苏州的第二位，检查了一下 B 超，结果一致，医生同样给出了多喝水，每天做少量多频次跳跃的建议。然后我问医生，能否喝可乐，医生回复是“随便喝”
我问他，可乐那些食品添加剂是否会增加肾脏的负担，医生回复“那些东西是很微量的，你肾脏每天过滤的东西多了去了，你要担心的是可乐的高热量带来的肥胖等问题，另外可乐属于碳酸饮料，会结合你摄入的钙，反而会减少你患草酸钙结石的几率，你要考虑的是大量碳酸赢料会影响你钙的吸收，可能导致骨骼问题，对肾没有什么大的影响”
问下，有没有，有一定引用次数，最好引用超过 100 次的科学文献（不是那种某自媒体的视频），论证可乐这种碳酸饮料是否对肾有影响？]]></summary>

        <id>https://www.v2ex.com/t/1062728#reply12</id>
        <link href="https://www.v2ex.com/t/1062728#reply12"/>
        <updated>2024-08-05T12:31:08.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[最近开源了个小项目 CrossPaste，实现跨设备的粘贴板应用，当前支持 Mac/Windows/Linux （移动端在开发中）。
开发这个项目主要目的是为了帮助多平台开发、设计人员（其实是我自己）解决多个设备间需要频繁同步数据的问题，现有的工具往往需要发送 -> 接收 -> 保存 -> 拷贝 -> 粘贴使用，效率低下，也严重打断工作心流。
CrossPaste 的核心目标：在任意设备间复制粘贴，就像在同一台设备上操作一样自然流畅。
当然单机的粘贴板管理功能也都支持
支持多种粘贴板类型（文本、html 富文本、链接、图片、文件（文件夹））
支持历史搜索，自动粘贴（返回上一个获取焦点的软件自动粘贴）
支持收藏粘贴板
支持纯快捷键操作
为什么要开源项目，考虑到了一些其他原因
CrossPaste 使用 compose-multiplatform 技术实现一套代码构建跨平台应用，compose-multiplatform 社区迭代还是蛮快的，但是国内资料相对还比较少，我这个项目就当是抛砖了
类似的项目也有很多，闭门造车可能只能解决自己的问题，我希望更多人参与进来（反馈意见、请求新功能、贡献代码都欢迎），解决大家的问题
安全原因，粘贴板记录是一个非常隐私敏感的问题，我想开源可以提高透明度，让大家更加放心使用（也可以自行构建）
开源地址： https://github.com/CrossPaste/crosspaste-desktop
官网： https://crosspaste.com
下载页面： https://crosspaste.com/download
也可以到 GitHub release 页面下载： https://github.com/CrossPaste/crosspaste-desktop/releases
如果觉得项目不错欢迎点个 star
另外叠个甲，我并没有购买微软的代码签名证书（这类证书一般需要每年 4-5k ，毕竟当前状态是为爱发电，还不会考虑去买。但是如果有富哥愿意 Github sponsor ，我会将收入用来购买证书），所以在 win 启动应用可能会弹出系统或者杀毒软件告警，这是正常现象。
但是有个好消息是 CrossPaste 上架了 Microsoft Store ，可以直接在商店下载安装，微软帮忙签名就没有这些困扰了。]]></summary>
