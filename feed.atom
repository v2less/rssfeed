        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Well this was a major surprise so I figured I’d share it here to get some eyeballs on it.
Essentially, the latest iOS (16.4 at post time) allows your cellular carrier (via eSIM) to add “managed networks” to your device.
These networks cannot be removed, they cannot have “automatically join” disabled, and they have equal priority with your real, personal networks.
So guess what happens when your neighbors get a wifi/modem combo that blasts a free hotspot SSID? Not only does it pollute the already crowded 2.4ghz band, your iPhone will often prefer this connection over your real /local wifi (despite said wifi being at 1 bar).
As of post-time, these is no way to remove these networks short of completely disabling cell service/removing the eSIM and resetting all network settings.
You can see this for yourself by going to WiFi/“edit” and scrolling down.
Edit: to clarify, I can disable “auto join”, but in 4-5 minutes all of my devices have auto-join turned back on. I’m guessing it re-syncs with the carrier profile. Also, this does not seem to be eSIM or SIM related it can happen on both.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'd like to fully make the jump instead of just screwing around with VMs and dual booting, but there are several pieces of software that I need to have that don't have a Linux version. Microsoft Excel (not the online one with 30% functionality, the full program). 3DS Max, Substance Painter, Affinity Photo/Designer/Publisher, PDFSam (though there's probably other good software for merging PDFs in Linux already), Unreal Engine, etc.
 The list is pretty extensive. I went through my computer and between work and personal use, there are 17 pieces of software that do not have a Linux version, and since I'm working WITH other people and with plenty of my own old files, I can't just chuck an "alternative" like gimp or inkscape on there. It has to be the actual software.

 Starting systemd-udevd version 252.5-1-manjaro
 :: running early hook [miso_pxe_nbd]
 :: running hook [udev]
 :: Triggering uvents...
 ...and then it hangs all night. I figure my first step is to wipe the HD (to eliminate Win OEM as a confounding factor), but all liveusbs hang like this, including Ubuntu Mini, Manjaro minimal, Debian, etc (they work fine on other machines). Note that I went into the BIOS and disabled SecureBoot (which resulted in a predictable fail message to start liveUSBs).
 Online I find suggestions that nvidia drivers may be failing (mostly reddit and manjaro forums), so I'd like to try loading a simple shell and formatting /dev/sda that way. I tried both the open source and proprietary drivers.
 Please let me know if I should be asking this question in a different sub. I've never really been lost like this before.
 tl;dr- Can anyone help me get running?
 edit: Adding 'nomodeset' also results in 'Triggering uevents' hang.

Before GradientJ, we’d been building NLP applications for 4 years, using transformer models like BERT. With the advent of LLMs and their zero-shot/few-shot capabilities, we saw the NLP dev cycle get flipped on its head. Rather than having to hire an army of data labelers and data scientists to fine-tune a BERT model for your use case, engineers can now use LLMs, like GPT-4, to build NLP endpoints in minutes.
As powerful as this is, the problem becomes that without appropriate tools for version control, regression testing, and ongoing maintenance like monitoring and A/B …]]></summary>

There are a lot of AI writing products out now, but we've found that most of them treat writing like a one-shot activity that should be delegated to AI.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[ACM 批评最新的 C 语言标准草案 C23

将于今年发布的 C23 标准带来了一系列新的特性和改变，“使编写安全、正确和可靠的代码变得更容易”。ACM 杂志最近撰文称，新标准的非特性、错误特性和缺陷都足够多和严重，程序员在没有仔细权衡风险和收益的情况下不应该 “升级” —— C23 “把几十年来完全合法的程序变成了燃烧弹”，如 C23 现在宣布 realloc(ptr,0) 为未定义行为。它还批评了 C23 的新的不可达注解，以及它在指针方面缺乏改进。


消息来源：ACM



老王点评：看来这次的 C23 未必能给 C 语言带来更好的发展，而另外一边，Rust 虎视眈眈。




VoIP 公司 3CX 最初以为供应链攻击是误报

VoiP 软件提供商 3CX 遭遇了一次供应链攻击，该公司称收到警告之后在 VirusTotal 上测试了其桌面应用，没发现问题，认为是一次误报。几天后又检查了一下，结果相同。但直到网络安全公司提供了完整细节之后 3CX 才认识到漏洞的情况。3CX 的日活用户高达 1200 万，包括诸多知名公司客户。该事件是自 2020 年 SolarWinds 被攻击和 2021 年 Kaseya 被攻击以来最突出的供应链攻击。


消息来源：The Register



老王点评：即便是这样大的公司，也可能面对供应链攻击会措手不及。




谷歌云端硬盘撤销 500 万文件数量限制

此前，有用户报告，谷歌云端硬盘服务对能储存的文件数量设定了 500 万的数量上限，超过这个限额之后就必须删除旧文件，否则将无法使用。它的最高容量为 30 TB，因此达到 500 万文件数量也是有可能的。这个上限只适用于你在云端硬盘中创建的文件数量，而不是分享到云端硬盘的文件总数。谷歌最初称这一做法是为了“保持强大的性能和可靠性”，有助于防止“滥用”。在听到用户反对之后，谷歌承认这一限制影响到了少部分用户，取消 500 万文件数量限制。


消息来源：The Verge



老王点评：这件事里面最糟糕的是，谷歌在没有征询用户意见和给出更弹性的解决方案时，就实施了限制。]]></summary>

“时代脱了节”，在巨大的震惊之中遭遇父亲鬼魂的哈姆雷特这样说。“时代”与“时间”在time这个词里得到了折叠，它不仅像阿格尼斯·赫勒所说，是历史时间而非宇宙时间，是自然法权与传统继承权之间的角力，同时，也是过去、现在与未来在王子胸中同时震荡的结果（【匈牙利】阿格尼斯·赫勒，《脱节的时代：作为历史哲人的莎士比亚》，吴亚蓉译，华夏出版社，2020，28-29页）。《哈姆雷特》是一个复仇的故事，复仇本身就是过去时间在未来的重影，衔接过去时间与未来时间的，是幽灵的命令、王子的疯癫、捕鼠器的戏中戏，以及哈姆雷特交出叙述的权利之后漫长的沉默——四个“凯洛斯时刻”。而如果挖掘这四个时刻之下幽深的洞穴，一个相互连通的地下世界将可能作为显象剧情的鬼魂而显现，在这里，“复仇”呈现为次要的情节，取而代之的，则是四个时刻共同指向的、对纯洁“丹麦性”的清洗，一种“自我”与“敌人”的辩证法：秩序的重建，最终落在了异邦人小福丁布拉斯的手上。
“四个凯洛斯时刻”，这是王炜在《试论诗神》中对《哈姆雷特》的解读。凯洛斯（Kairos），“时机”，奥登曾将其与钟表时间的准时相对立，认为它“蕴含了准时性的种子，但这种子没有开花”（W. H. Auden, The Dyer’s and Other Essays, New York: Random House, 1948, p.140）。开花的则是时间的潜能：保罗·蒂利希在《历史的诠释》中称之为“时间的实现”（这个定义，也是奥登在《凯洛斯与逻各斯》一诗中借鉴的定义，见Edward Mendelson, Early Auden Later Auden, Princeton: Princeton UP, 1981, 2017, p.489），或者说，在诸多流逝的瞬间之中，那个连通了未来一系…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[3 月 31 日，国产操作系统开源社区 OpenCloudOS 正式发布首个全自研社区 9.0 版本（以下简称 “OC9.0”）。据了解，该版本由腾讯等十余家企业共同开发并长期维护，其内核及用户态软件均为自主选型、独立演进，在操作系统发行版的全链路均实现自主可控。

操作系统等基础软件是信息技术的根基，也是亟需实现突破，掌握更多自主知识产权的关键核心技术领域。

当前，服务器操作系统发行版包含从 L1 到 L3 的不同层级。其中，L1 基于 Linux 内核及核心组件构建，是最上游的“源社区”版本；L2 企业版基于 L1 源社区版本加固，提供企业级的技术支持及服务，可用于真实业务场景，是稳定可靠的发行版本；L3 社区版基于 L2 企业版进一步优化，是代码完全开源、生态全面开放的发行版本。



早在 2010 年，腾讯就已经推出自研操作系统 TencentOS。TencentOS Server 在资源调度弹性、容器支持、系统性能及安全方面均有升级，更适合云环境。目前该操作系统已经覆盖了腾讯所有的业务。

在腾讯操作系统研发逐渐步入成熟的阶段，2021 年，OpenCloudOS 操作系统开源社区正式诞生。腾讯将十余年技术积累悉数投入，成为 OpenCloudOS 的主要发起者和核心技术贡献者。OpenCloudOS 以打造从 L1 到 L3 全覆盖的操作系统发行版为特色，致力于研发自主可控的下一代云原生操作系统，并以社区为依托，建设操作系统开源生态。



OpenCloudOS 社区 TOC（技术监督委员会）主席、腾讯云副总裁郭振宇表示：“从 L1 到 L3 的研发模式是一种完整成熟的操作系统研发模式，只有通过这样的模式，从源头社区切入，才能真正摆脱外部依赖，长期健康发展。”

今年 1 月，L1 源社区的 OpenCloudOS Stream 正式发布，在云原生、稳定性、性能等方面均有支撑，可以全面地支持所有硬件平台，提供自主创新的上游版本。

本次发布的 L3 社区版 OC9.0，是基于 L1 源社区的 OpenCloudOS Stream 优化推出，由腾讯与 Intel、北京红旗、中兴、龙芯、中科方德等二十余家单位共同研发。OC9 使用上游社区最新内核 Linux 6.1，提供多体系架构和新硬件支持，多核性能优化，混部隔离特性增强。同时，MGLRU、Mapple Tree 等特性提升内存管理效率，具备完善的 Cgroup V2 支持、多架构热补丁支持，并提供细致化的调优与系统适配。

LM-3 项目宣布了 MIT CADR Lisp 机器（Lisp Machine）系统软件的第 100 版，这是它的最后一个版本。它既是一个新的版本，也是一个非常 古老的版本。

前两天，IBM 的 Eric Moore 在 LinkedIn 上发布了关于这个版本的 消息，他帮助了这项恢复工作。该项目的一个更详细的 帖子 描述了这个软件是什么，以及它是从哪里恢复的。

为什么这很重要？好吧，这款软件和它所运行的机器，是一场 “重要战斗” 的标志和纪念物。那场战斗是一场战争的一个阶段：一场以 “针锋相对的方式” 制造计算机的战争。“历史是由胜利者书写的”，温斯顿·丘吉尔 不是 第一个这样说的人。

这场战争和大多数战争一样，是两个 “对手阵营” 之间的战争。一方认为，制造计算机的正确方法是用最好的语言编写最好的软件，如果有必要的话，还要设计精工巧做的计算机来运行这些软件。另一方认为制造计算机的正确方法是制造小而快、容易而简单的软件和硬件，完成大多数人当时需要的工作。

同样，像大多数战争一样，这场战争是漫长而险恶的，双方都有一些肮脏的内斗。最终，有一方取得了决定性的胜利，但已经花了太长的时间，胜利者大多是开始战斗的那些人的后代和亲属。如今，他们甚至根本不记得有这么一场战争，而胜利的一方最终吸收了很多失败一方的想法和技术。最终的结果是，软件并不小而快，也不容易而简单。胜利的一方忘记了他们在战斗，也忘记了与之战斗的对手。

当胜利者忘记他们已经胜利了，也忘记了他们在战斗，这意味着失败者可以写一些最好的战争总结。一篇著名的报道是写自 1991 年的文章，名为《Lisp：好消息，坏消息，如何大获全胜》，其中说：


这两种哲学被称为 “做正确的事（The Right Thing）” 和 “差点则更好…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi HN! I’m Joseph, and along with Arpan and Bailey we are the founders of OutSail Shipping (https://outsailshipping.com/). We’re building a sail the size of a 747 that rolls up into a shipping container. When deployed, it will generate thrust from the wind to reduce the fuel consumption of a cargo ship. An array of these devices will reduce fuel consumption on ships by up to 20%. These sails are easily stowed and removed to cause no interference with cargo operations. Here’s a short video showing our prototype: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VUpVqzpym54.
Sails powered ships for millennia; but then the convenience of energy-dense fuels displaced sails. As ship speeds eventually exceeded wind speeds, the consensus became that sails had no place in shipping and were relegated to hobbyists an…]]></summary>

 Does there exist a zathura-like document viewer that supports highlights and all basic syntax that normal pdf viewers have, but also has the option to export highlights into something like a formatted LaTeX document?
 It would take the highlights, and put them under headers for what chapter they're under in some sort of .md or .tex document, and then compile into their own pdf of notes. 
 Is this redundant or a good idea?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[“pgdatinit” is a kernel which is started by executing “kthread_run()” function (https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v6.3-rc4/source/mm/page_alloc.c#L2284). The kernel thread executes the “deferred_init_memmap()” function (https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v6.3-rc4/source/mm/page_alloc.c#L2108).
 Thus, “pgdatinit” is responsible for initializing memory on every node of the system. For each node a dedicated kernel thread is created with the name pattern “pgdatinit[NodeNumber]” (https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v6.3-rc4/source/mm/page_alloc.c#L2283).
 Overall, the kernel thread is created in case CONFIG_DEFERRED_STRUCT_PAGE_INIT is enabled when compiling the kernel. Which states that initialization of struct pages is deferred to kernel threads (https://cateee.net/lkddb/web-lkddb/DEFERRED_STRUCT_PAGE_INIT.html).
 Lastly, after the initialization flow is finished an information message is sent to the kernel ring buffer (https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v6.3-rc4/source/mm/page_alloc.c#L2177) — as you can see in the image below.

之前我们报道过，某个主流电商应用利用零日漏洞达成不可卸载、窃取用户信息等恶意功能，后被谷歌 下架。此事也被其它安全团队独立 验证。据外媒报道，该公司有上百人负责挖掘安卓漏洞，并利用这些漏洞。最初带有恶意功能的版本只针对农村和小城镇的用户，以避免被发现。通过收集用户活动的大量数据，它得以提供更具有个性化的推送通知和广告，吸引用户打开应用并下单。此事曝光发酵后，该团队被解散，大部分人员被分流。并释出了新的版本移除了漏洞利用代码，但底层代码仍保留在其中。安全专家表示，他们从未看到过一个主流应用会那样做。

上古的 LISP 机系统软件 v100 恢复成功

这是 MIT CADR Lisp 机的系统软件的最后一个版本。因此，这既是一个新的版本，也是一个非常古老的版本。这款软件和它所运行的机器是一场“重要战斗”的标志和纪念物，那场战斗是一场以敌对方式制造计算机的战争。战斗的双方，MIT/斯坦福一方认为，制造计算机的正确方法是用最好的语言编写最好的软件，如果有必要的话，还要设计特殊的花哨的计算机来运行这些软件；新泽西一方认为制造计算机的正确方法是制造小而快、容易和简单的软件和硬件，做大多数人在当时需要的事情。结果我们都知道了，MIT Lisp 机已经湮没在历史中；而胜利方开发出了 Unix 和 C，建立了 RISC、CISC、X86 指令架构，和基于 Algol 的整个语言家族，包括从 BASIC 到 C++ 到 Pascal 到 Go。被恢复的是 MIT CADR Lisp 机的系统软件的最终版本，从备份磁带上花费了十年的时间提取和清理，并使其在 35 年后首次运行。

GNOME 可能已经抛弃了 Gedit 作为默认的文本编辑器，但它仍然是 Linux 老用户的最爱。

它主要是一个文本编辑器，但通过一些调整，它可以作为一个轻量级的代码编辑器使用。

是啊！为什么要用 VS Code 或其他专门的代码编辑器来编写 Bash 脚本或其他语言的简单程序？用 Gedit 也可以过一天。

我将在本文中分享一些我最喜欢的 Gedit 技巧和窍门。虽然大多数的调整对写代码是有益的，但有些对一般的文本写作也是有帮助的。

1、安装插件

可能个别人甚至不知道 Gedit 有强大的插件功能。你可以安装插件来获得额外的功能。

有两种类型的插件：


可以从编辑器菜单中访问的官方 Gedit 插件

第三方插件，可以从项目网站上下载，并放入插件目录中（下面讨论）。


Gedit 插件可以放在 /usr/share/gedit/plugins 或 ~/.local/share/gedit/plugins 目录下。



你可以通过点击 “汉堡包” 菜单，然后打开 “首选项Preferences” 窗口来访问可用和已安装的插件。



首选项窗口有 “插件Plugins” 标签，你可以看到所有可用的插件。你可以使用复选框来启用和禁用这些插件。



2、在侧边栏中显示文件浏览器

如果你正在处理一个有多个文件和文件夹的项目，在侧边栏中用文件浏览器看到所有可用的文件是相当有用的。

进入 “首选项” -> “插件”，启用 “文件浏览器面板File Browser Panel”。



之后，点击右上角的汉堡包菜单，从菜单 “查看View” -> “侧面板Side Panel” 启用侧面板视图。

现在把侧面板视图改为文件浏…]]></summary>

2023年3月10日至19日，中国摄影艺术家郭小明的《墟像·黑锈》个人摄影展在日本大阪Gallery176美术馆公开展出，备受瞩目。
郭小明是1954年生人，自上世纪七十年代拥有第一台相机，便沉迷其中，几十年不改初衷。1980年他离开任教的中学，成为职业摄影师。1985年在威尼斯国际电影节上获奖的电影《高山庙》（戴思杰导演，这是中国第一部在三大电影节获奖的影片），他就是摄影。当然，他主要从事的还是所谓“拍照片”的摄影。
疫情三年，客观上限制了摄影活动的半径。一次偶然路过，郭小明被一片工业废墟吸引。步入其中，映入视线的是巨大建筑的颓败；杂草丛生、砖石塌落，唯有框架耸立。他在惊讶中陷入迷茫，并尝试按下了快门。后来再在电脑上看那些照片时，他感觉自己“有了新的想法——那是不可多得的影像！虽然是独自面对废弃的建筑体，面对锈迹斑斑的设备，面对败于风雨的门窗，却可以感受到曾经存在的蒸汽，曾经存在的腾升，曾经存在的人，在眼前静态里残存的喧闹”。
自2021年年初到2022年年底，两年时间，郭小明的目光和脚步深入到成都周边六个工业废墟，上百次进入，离开，再进入，在人迹罕至的废墟里徘徊，无论寒冬酷暑。他说：冬季有枯枝衬映会产生一种凄美感，夏季有烈日辉映会呈现壮美感。
不同的季节，不同的天气，不同的光线，拍摄数千张照片，呈现不同的景象。他的“内心被一次次触动”，每按下一次快门就会发生一次对话，与时间，空间，锈迹，建筑，空窗。反复的观察和拍摄，逐渐形成独特的画面语言。以艺术的视角和语境记录一段时光，既是历史的子料，也是个性化的艺术作品。
在废墟影像的拍摄中，郭小明最为关注的有三点：一是工业设备在光影中的构成，包括线条的变化、体量的对比、质感的表现、形态的冲突；二是建筑体的构成，包括空间的错落、光影与块面的平衡；三是残破门窗在空间中的独特性，包括其中色彩的褪变和戏剧性的冲突。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[据路透社报道，推特4月1日起宣布逐步关闭传统验证程序，淘汰此前的账号认证系统，取消没有付费的账号的认证标记，并对企业和个人提供不同的认证服务套餐。在美国，企业想要保持“金V”就得每月付1000美元，个人则每月需付8美元（或每年84美元）续上“蓝V”认证。不少美媒拒绝为企业账号和员工账号付费。


美国主流媒体《纽约时报》、《华盛顿邮报》、《洛杉矶时报》纷纷表示，他们不会为其官方推特账户或记者的账户购买推特的Twitter Blue认证服务，因为这项认证不再像以前那样代表着权威和专业。


《纽约时报》发言人表示，将不会为推特的这项服务支付月费，也不会为旗下记者报销个人账户的Twitter Blue费用，“除非在极少数情况下，这种认证状态对报道目的至关重要”。


《纽约时报》拒绝付费引发了马斯克的羞辱和嘲讽。他在推特上说，“他们（《纽约时报》）的推文就像拉肚子，无法阅读”，“如果他们只发自己的头部文章，他们会有更多真正的粉丝”，“《纽约时报》的真正悲剧在于，他们的宣传甚至都不有趣”。


被问及自己当下最青睐的新闻源，马斯克回答道：推特。


他批《纽约时报》“非常虚伪”，称其一方面不买推特的付费认证，一方面又要求读者付费订阅文章。


值得一提的是，在推特发布最新认证规定后，除了《纽约时报》，美国《华盛顿邮报》和《洛杉矶时报》也宣布不会付费维持认证，理由是认证标记不再代表权威性和专业性，只意味着该用户为这个账号交钱了。Buzzfeed和美国政治新闻网“Politico”也通知员工，不会再报销他们的账号认证费用。


另据美国新闻网站“Axios”报道，白宫数字战略总监罗布·弗莱厄蒂（Rob Flaherty）通过电子邮件告诉员工，不会为继续认证账号的工作人员个人账户支付认证费用，他们可以自费购买相关服务。

2022年岁末，我终于读完了《世界一分为二：伍尔夫、T.S.艾略特、E.M.福斯特、D.H.劳伦斯，以及他们的1922年》，该书英文原版于2017年问世，作者是纽约市立大学英文系博士、《纽约时报》网络版书评编辑比尔·戈斯坦（Bill Goldstein），他也为NBC节目“Weekend Today in New York”撰写书评和采访。
要想大概知道全书内容，可以看前言中这段话：
某些年代公认是历史转折点，例如1492年哥伦布发现新大陆、1776年美国独立、1965年美军出兵越南。至于1922年，则是文学史上的分水岭。《世界一分为二》聚焦于1922年四位传奇作家的故事，包括伍尔夫、T. S. 艾略特、E. M. 福斯特、D. H. 劳伦斯，在那不凡的年代，四位作家因缘际会与时共感，创造出了明日的语言。 
“1922年前后，是文坛的分水岭。”这句引领全书的文字，来自薇拉·凯瑟的作品《未满四十请勿看》。1922年2月2日，乔伊斯四十岁生日，他的现代主义长篇小说《尤利西斯》单行本也正在这天由巴黎的莎士比亚书店出版。1922年10月15日，诗人艾略特名作《荒原》在《标准》（The Criterion）杂志面世，而艾略特的三十五岁生日，是在几周前的9月26日。《尤利西斯》与《荒原》的出版，正是使得1922年成为现代主义元年的两件标志性大事。《世界一分为二》这本书的最后一页这样回顾1922年之于世界文学历史的意义：

在本指南中，我们将逐步演示如何在 Ubuntu 22.04 LTS 上安装 CRI-O。

先决条件

在开始之前，这是你需要的：


具有 SSH 访问权限的 Ubuntu 22.04 实例

在实例上配置的 sudo 用户

快速稳定的互联网连接


有了这个，让我们开始吧。

步骤 1：更新系统并安装依赖

立即登录你的服务器实例，并按如下方式更新包列表：

$ sudo apt update


更新本地包索引后，按如下方式安装依赖项：

$ sudo apt install apt-transport-https ca-certificates curl gnupg2 software-properties-common -y


步骤 2：添加 CRI-O 存储库

要安装 CRI-O，我们需要在 Ubuntu 上添加或启用它的仓库。但首先，你需要根据操作系统和要安装的 CRI-O 版本定义变量。

因此，定义如下变量：

$ export OS=xUbuntu_22.04
$ export CRIO_VERSION=1.24


完成后，运行以下命令集以添加 CRI-O Kubic 仓库：

$ echo "deb https://download.opensuse.org/repositories/devel:/kubic:/libcontainers:/stable/$OS/ …]]></summary>

        <link href="https://donuts-are-good.github.io/shhhbb/"/>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello all :) I made this BBS for fun and thought you all would enjoy it. It's not perfect, but it's been a fun exercise!
see it: https://asciinema.org/a/Emg6SWrXMV6cehfQxrw1GRu75
try it:
    ssh -p 2223 shhhbb.com

https://github.com/donuts-are-good/shhhbb/releases/latest
why?
Every year I challenge myself in some new way, this year it is to push one project per week. You might recognize my static site generator [0] or my releaser for go [1] from previous posts as one of these weekly projects. If you want to join me in doing this, it's been a blast and I highly recommend it! Maybe we can chat on the bbs about it :)
[0] - bearclaw tiny static generator - https://github.com/donuts-are-good/bearclaw
[1] - release.sh release builder for go - https://github.com/donuts-are-good/bearclaw
need:
I'd love a few co-conspirators, or even some new friends for the bbs software or the bbs itself. A lofty nice-to-have goal is meeting a few other similarly motivated people to conspire with on a weekly basis. If that's you, drop me a line!
goals:
I have about half of an admin interface endpoint pushed up, which I'd like to finish. I realized mid-commit that I'd lacked some other material in a previous commit, and in pushing it up, I ended up pushing half the admin feature. Stay tuned for that.
I'd also like to implement a feature where I surrender the socket to a new process so I can upgrade the binary without dropping all of the connected users. I'm not sure on the feasibility of this, but all the words fit together, so it'll be tried.

In the process, I'm looking to get a new laptop, and so far the new macbooks look like they have all the right technical specs. Wondering if anyone is using Linux on their macbook, and if they're enjoying the experience? 
 Alternatively, I'm totally open to laptop recommendations at this point.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Valve 显示 Linux 游戏玩家份额大跌

Valve 刚刚公布了 2023 年 3 月的 Steam 调查结果，这些初步数字显示 Linux 游戏市场份额下降了 0.54%，使整个 Linux 游戏人口只占 Steam 客户群的 0.84% 左右。而 2 月份的数据为 1.27%。Steam Deck 仍在疯狂销售，所以看到如此大的月度环比跌幅令人惊讶。不过，3 月份数据显示简体中文用户跃升了 27%，现在占 Steam 上整体游戏客户群的 51%。这也是一个非常令人吃惊的数据。如果这一数据准确的话，倒是能说明 Linux 用户群份额降低的原因。

老王点评：Steam 报告的数据不是第一次出错了，希望是又一次数学没学好，毕竟这数据有点匪夷所思了。




人工智能政策小组称，FTC 应阻止 OpenAI 推出新的 GPT 模型

人工智能和数字政策中心（CAIDP）今天提出投诉，要求美国联邦贸易委员会（FTC）调查 OpenAI 违反消费者保护规则的行为，认为 OpenAI 推出的人工智能文本生成工具 “有偏见，有欺骗性，并对公共安全构成风险”。CAIDP 认为，GPT-4 越过了伤害消费者的界限，应该引起监管行动。在投诉中，CAIDP 要求 FTC 停止任何进一步的 GPT 模式的商业部署，并要求在未来推出任何模式之前对其进行独立评估。FTC 已经表达了对人工智能工具的监管兴趣。

老王点评：这是什么盘外招都使出了啊。




谷歌再次暂停废弃 Manifest V2

早在 2018 年 11 月，谷歌就以安全、隐私和性能等既定理由要修改 Chrome 浏览器扩展 API，即 Manifest V2。鉴于它很容易被滥用，允许开发人员创建占用资源的扩展，也不是特别适合于移动设备，谷歌在新推出的 Manifest V3 删除了一些 API，但这导致广告拦截等扩展不能工作或需要修改工作方式。根据统计，去年底，大约有 13.6 万个扩展仍然在 MV2 下运行，而大约有 3 万个扩展依赖 MV3 代码。谷歌已经屡次推迟废弃 MV2 的计划，最近一次承诺在 3 月修订该指南，但目前已再次推迟，并且没有明确的时间表。


消息来源：The Register



老王点评：新的 API 或许有更好的地方，但是既有的扩展生态带来的反弹可能超乎了谷歌的预料。]]></summary>

最近几个月，以ChatGPT为代表的聊天机器人引起全世界的广泛关注。GPT是如何工作的？它会有自我意识吗？人工智能将对我们的社会、文化、知识系统造成何种冲击和重构？奇点到了吗？未来人类有能力与人工智能“抗衡”吗？《上海书评》特邀亚马逊云科技上海人工智能研究院院长、上海纽约大学计算机系终身教授张峥和作家小白对谈，讨论人工智能的训练方式及其在未来的可能走向。

张峥：GPT的基础是大语言模型，这些大模型本质上在训练的时候是在做接龙游戏——把下一页书给写出来——但它们有两点是远超人类的，第一是海量阅读，第二是其中有百分之十的数据是非常结构化的代码（以及代码周围的注释）。大致的结果就是模型中既存了知识（更准确的说是知识的碎片），又存了勾连知识碎片的逻辑，参数上大概是二比一这个样子。举例说，“着火了，赶紧跑”，这个动作的顺序是逻辑，“火”和“跑”是知识。我认为在大模型里面不存在纯粹脱离知识的逻辑，也不存在不被某种逻辑连带的知识，这两个加起来就是一个所谓世界模型（World Model）的雏形。这是一个大致准确的描述，大模型内部具体是如何工作的，学界都还没有一个定论。

 I own a small tech blog called https://notatether.com, where I focus on cool stuff inside Windows, Linux, and the internet (and occasionally MacOS), as well as apps written for all of those.
 I'd like to interview people around here on what their all-time favorite Linux distro release was and why., so I can feature them on my website. Expect me to ask a lot of questions about your software/hardware setup as well as what you do with your Linux machines running that distro.
 If you're interested, reply here with your favorite distro and some short context, then go to my website and fill out the contact form with your experience running that distro (and other distros), and I'll promptly get back to you by email.
 I think it will be a win-win for everyone; you guys will get a(nother) platform, and I'll become more well known.

当 systemd 刚问世时，有很多关于它能加快启动时间的消息。这项功能对大多数人都有吸引力（对那些不重启的人来说就不那么重要了），所以在很多方面，这也是它今天仍然拥有的声誉。虽然 systemd 确实是在启动过程中并行启动服务起到了作用，但它的作用远不止于此。以下是你可能没有意识到 systemd 可以做的三件事，但你应该好好利用。

1、简化 Linux ps

如果你曾经使用过 ps，甚至只是 top 命令，那么你就会知道你的电脑一直都在运行数百个进程。有时，这正是你需要的信息，以便了解你的计算机或其用户在做什么。其他时候，你真正需要的是一个总体的概览。

systemd-cgtop 命令提供了一个基于控制组cgroup任务安排的计算机负载的简单视图。控制组 对现代 Linux 很重要，基本上是容器和 Kubernetes 的底层支持结构（这也是云计算可以扩展的原因），但它们也是家庭电脑上的有用结构。例如，从 systemd-cgtop 的输出中，你可以看到用户进程的负载，而不是系统进程：

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[近日，迪士尼宣布启动7000人的裁员计划，第一轮裁员本周就将启动。作为迪士尼旗下著名的流媒体平台，Hulu也未能幸免，虽然该平台并未正式在中国推出其视频流媒体服务，但却在中国设有研发中心，为美国市场提供技术支持和创新。


流媒体巨头裁员，知情人士：规模或超90%


据21世纪经济报道，自多方了解到，Hulu北京启动裁员。也有知情人士称，本次Hulu北京裁员规模超过90%。


资料显示，作为美国流媒体巨头，Hulu由美国国家广播环球公司和福克斯共同成立于2007年，总部位于美国洛杉矶，并在包括洛杉矶、纽约、芝加哥、北京等地设有共计8个办公室及研发中心。


其中，北京是仅次于总部的全球第二大研发中心，也是Hulu在全球最早建立的办公点之一。自2007年Hulu北京成立以来，其团队规模从不到10人已经发展至约200名员工规模。


据Hulu官网介绍，Hulu北京主要包括技术研发及产品团队。除北京之外，Hulu全球研发及产品团队还涉及圣莫妮卡（Santa Monica）、西雅图（Seattle）等地。


根据21世纪经济报道记者查询，目前Hulu官方已没有在华招聘职位。有消息称，此次Hulu裁员补偿为N+3。


一位知情人士表示，Hulu在华以技术人员居多，且“招聘标准非常高，程序员非常多清北（毕业的人）”、“找工作肯定没问题，但被裁了还是蛮唏嘘的”。


据Hulu官网介绍，截至2023年2月，Hulu在美付费用户达到4800万人，平台影视剧超过7万，直播频道超过85个。


据华尔街日报30日报道，迪士尼在北京裁减逾300名专注于流媒体业务的员工，为该集团削减成本和重组举措的一部分。据悉受裁员影响的是为迪士尼流媒体业务开发个性化、搜寻和客户识别等功能的技术员工。迪士尼在声明中表示，在中国的裁员行动是该公司削减成本和全球重组的一部分。


和迪士尼近期的裁员计划有关


华尔街日报的报道表明，Hulu此次裁员，和其控股股东迪士尼近期启动的裁员计划有关。


此前，2019年3月，迪士尼通过收购21世纪福克斯资产加持了其Hulu股权；5月，迪士尼和康卡斯特（Comcast）共同宣布，迪士尼将从后者手中获得Hulu的“全面运营控制权”。根据协议，康卡斯特可以选择在5年后，以至少275亿美元的估值将名下33%的Hulu股权出售给迪士尼。


新冠疫情爆发后，为了应对疫情带来的危机，迪士尼开始了一系列的调整和重组。2022年10月份，迪士尼宣布将其媒体和娱乐业务进行重组，将更多的资源和重心放在流媒体服务上。


2023年3月份，迪士尼宣布了一轮裁员计划，涉及7000名员工，主要来自其电视、电影和流媒体业务。


迪士尼公司首席执行官鲍勃·艾格（Bob Iger）27日表示，7000人的裁员计划将分成三轮进行，第一轮本周启动，首批被裁的员工将在接下来的四天内收到通知。第二轮裁员将于4月份实施，涉及人数会比第一轮更多。第三轮裁员，预计将在春末夏初完成。


除此之外，迪士尼的流媒体业务近年来遇到不小的挫折，这或许也是Hulu收缩的原因之一。


据财报显示，去年第四季度迪士尼媒体与娱乐业务线营收147.76亿美元，同比仅增长1%，经营亏损为1000万美元。另外，Disney+首次出现订阅用户下降，有240万订阅用户流失，数量远高于预期。


但2018年到2022年，迪士尼内容总投入高达1144亿美元，而在此期间，迪士尼总营收是3446亿美元。迪士尼在流媒体上投入的金额占这些年总营收的33.2%，也就是说，迪士尼拿出了三分之一的营收去贡献给流媒体业务，却并未获得相应的利润。


Hulu在中国面临的市场竞争和监管也可能是其裁员的原因之一。


Hulu虽然在美国拥有较高的市场份额和用户基数，但在中国却没有正式推出其视频流媒体服务。Hulu在中国主要以技术研发为主，为美国市场提供技术支持和创新。


然而，在中国的视频流媒体市场上，Hulu面临着众多强劲的竞争对手，如爱奇艺、腾讯视频、优酷等。这些平台不仅拥有庞大的用户群和内容库，还拥有强大的本土化能力和营销策略。Hulu要想在中国市场上获得一席之地，需要付出巨大的成本和投入，并且面临着不确定的收益和风险。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[One big worry I have is that most Linux app developers are not getting paid. If they can't make a living, I fear they will have to abandon their projects in the long run. What a shame.
 We, the Linux users, NEED to embrace the idea of "giving back/donating". You get all this stuff you love for free. So - if you can - then why not give a little donation?
 By doing this, you will strengthen the dev team of your favorite apps, thus ensuring a higher quality product in the future.
 With this in mind, I am planning to add a "Donate" function for each app downloaded in the Software Center in Kumander Linux.
 The economy will be something like this:
 5% goes to Kumander Linux dev team, ensuring the further development of the OS
 25% is shared between all developers whos app was recently downloaded, but did not get a donation
 70% goes straight to the developer of the app being donated towards
 It's a win/win/win folks.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ubuntu Unity 的负责人提出了一个新的发行版，听起来像是每个人都可能想要关注的东西。




听起来太牵强了？

好吧，blendOS 把自己定位为发行版的终极杂拌。

blendOS 是 Rudra Saraswat 的一个新项目，他以基于 Ubuntu 的合成版而闻名，特别是 Ubuntu Unity（现在是官方的 Ubuntu 风味版）。

我想说的是，这个项目有一个非常准确的名字来表达它想要实现的目标。

但是，blendOS 的目标是如何成为所有人的替代品？它到底是什么？

blendOS 不只是又一个 Linux 发行版



blendOS 是一个基于 Arch 的发行版，它支持每种类型的应用程序包。

如果你了解过 carbonOS 和 Vanilla OS，你应该对这类发行版中的一些共同点有了了解。

其中之一是，不可变性，意思是，操作系统的核心/基础保持不变，给你带来增强的安全性，以及更简单和可靠的更新。

同样，blendOS 也有以下的关键亮点：


不可变操作系统

支持多个软件包管理器，包括 Apt、DNF、Yum、Pacman 和 Yay

支持多种桌面环境

Flathub 商店桌面应用


blendOS 使用 Jade GUI（来自 Crystal Linux 的安装程序）来提供一个无缝的安装体验。而且，Flathub 商店可以直接安装应用程序，而不是像人们想象的那样下载 Flatpakref文件。

为了使所有的发行版的软件包都能正常工作，blendOS 使用其软件包管理器 blend。

你仍然可以通过 Arch 容器在命令行使用 Pacman。

此外，它还支持，T2 Mac，即 2018 年后生产的英特尔 Mac。因此，如果你想在你已经拥有的设备上做实验，blendOS 应该可以使用。


🚧 截至目前，该项目还处于早期发展阶段。


预计一些直接的变化包括：




用 Podman 代替 Distrobox 的实现

一个新的 GUI 配置工具，支持管理覆盖层和容器


所以，是的，你现在看到的东西可能会有变化。然而，它仍然是听起来令人激动的东西。

你可以在其 官方博客文章 中阅读其计划中的变化，并在其 GitHub 页面中探索 blendOS。


blendOS


你对 blendOS 有什么看法？它值得关注吗？请在评论中告诉我！

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello everyone,
I am the founder of a blogging platform called Feather.so.
People can sign up and create their own blogs using Feather.
Now, with OpenAI releasing their API, they made using AI so accessible for someone like me. So I wanted to add a chatbot functionality to my customer blogs. Basically, I wanted to automatically create a chatbot for each of my customer blogs. That chatbot will be trained on the content on their blog.
When I set out to do this using Open AI, I thought I could do this for every website, not just for my customer blogs.
So I ended up creating an entirely new product called SiteGPT.ai so that it can be used on any website.
The workflow works like this. People login the platform, they enter their website url, and click on a button to start training. Then I start creating a chatbot and train the chatbot will all the content on the website that the user enters.
That chatbot now knows everything about that website. It can answer any questions related to that website.
I have also added a demo chatbot at the bottom right of the sitegpt.ai website. That chatbot is trained on the content of SiteGPT.ai. So it can answer any questions related to its own website.
Please try it out and let me know if you have any feedback. I am also happy to take any other technical questions you may have.
Thanks.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[当前，数字化转型已成各行各业稳发展的“必答题”，对于站在数字化转型潮头浪尖的金融行业来说更是如此。而在技术选择上，因为应用形态与基础设施交替发展，将 IT 基础设施再一次带到十字路口。基础设施经历了虚拟化、云平台，直至容器技术在过去五年普及。另一方面，应用的架构从单体架构，到复杂度提升之后早期主流的三层架构，应用软件变得越来越复杂。

一、容器云成为银行业云原生建设基础

近期《金融电子化》杂志社发布了《银行业私有云建设发展报告》，共有 129 家银行业金融机构参与调研。报告通过汇集行业上百家金融机构科技决策者在云计算建设应用过程中的经验，总结提炼了金融云技术的应用现状、发展趋势以及建设使用中的关注点，对于同行业以及所有的云计算行业从业者来说都非常值得借鉴和参考。

报告中也提到了容器云的应用现状与趋势，有近 1/3 的银行进行了容器云建设。



但是在建设的银行中，已经有 2/3 完成了建设，并且半数银行已经覆盖渠道类和业务类等系统。容器云有利于统一软件交付和运维的模式，从而更好地支撑以互联网业务为代表的敏态业务创新需求。





因此，银行容器云建设比私有云更为积极，32% 的银行选择了本着“能上尽上”的原则。



从应用形态上，新业务尽可能的开始部署在具备容器能力的平台上，同时这些业务也具备了敏捷，快速迭代的特点。

从组织架构上，银行业的 90% 客户都将“容器云”的规划放到规划重点上来，由于云计算平台的规划既要解决业务开发的问题，同时也要解决运维的问题，所以牵头部门无论是开发部还是运维部，都需要一体化的考虑容器能力的建设与方向。

在架构形态上，除了容器化所带来的更加平滑的升级能力、自动化的应用发布以及更为标准化的中间件管理能力之外，“为满足信创要求而必须考虑的“‘一云多芯’能力，支持信创平台建设与应用迁移”能力关注度为 74.5%。…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[如果你想要制作一个网站，但又不想暴露自己的身份和信息，那么你可能需要采用一些匿名制作网站的方法。常见的制作方法和思路是，使用免费邮箱、网站空间和域名，结合起来搭建一个网站。尽可能不要使用手机和支付系统，下面笔者就介绍一下具体的制作步骤。


先进行身份隔离，注册一个全新的Gmail邮箱账号，增加APP的两步验证，不要绑定手机号，不要用这个邮箱注册任何国内服务，注册的服务越少越好，这样可以保证这个邮箱不会被轻易追踪或者泄露。


用该Gmail邮箱开通一个Google Blogger，即可开通博客网站。Blogger是Google提供的免费博客平台，用户可以在上面发布想要分享的内容，也可以选择不同的模板和主题来美化网站，并且没有广告，是一个非常优秀的免费网站空间。


做为网站来说，域名通常不可缺少，免费域名一般不太可靠，因此大多数情况还要购买域名。Cloudflare是一个提供域名和CDN服务的平台，可以使用之前注册的Gmail邮箱在Cloudflare注册和购买域名，然后将域名解析到Blogger网站上，这样你就拥有了一个独立的网址，通过这个独立网址即可访问搭建在Blogger上的网站。


使用Gmail箱注册Paypal进行支付。Paypal是一个提供在线支付和转账服务的平台，可以用它来购买或者接收一些付款，而不需要暴露银行卡或者信用卡信息。


不要和任何人进行任何合作，对外联系只用Gmail，一切事情自己搞定。这样可以避免被别人利用或者出卖，也可以减少被发现或者被举报的风险。


不要在第三方客户端登录Gmail，只在Web端登录，小心木马邮件。这样可以防止邮箱被盗取或者被植入恶意软件，也可以避免被监控或者被拦截。


如果网站遇到网络攻击，开启Cloudflare的WAF（Web应用防火墙）进行防御。WAF可以帮助站长抵御一些常见的网络攻击，如SQL注入、跨站脚本、DDoS等。


除了上面提到的网络服务之外，不要用该邮箱注册其他网络服务。这样可以减少你在网络上留下的痕迹，也可以避免被其他服务泄露或者出售你的信息。另外，全部服务都不要添加手机号码，也不要使用手机注册、访问和使用，手机是最不安全的设备之一，能不用就不用。手机的唯一作用就是，安装和使用Google Authenticator（Google身份验证器）。


以上就是匿名制作网站的思路和方法，供大家参考。]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So, last night for the heck of it, I did a base install of Arch Linux in a VM. Took me about 25-30 minutes.
 Anyway, while in Virtualbox, I noticed I had a few VMs still in there that I'd already installed but haven't used them in a while (6-8 months at least). So I decided to update them last night and today. I like having them around so I can take a look at things if I need to. They're kinda handy that way.
 I'm finding that pretty much all of them needed to have the mirrors updated because the ones I was using are no longer working. You might see an error come up saying something about a certain IP (something like 65.120.45.6 is unreachable) not being reachable. All you need to do is just go into your mirrors and select new ones. It's pretty easy in Mint (working on that VM right now) and I'm sure any Debian based system should be just as easy to fix. A Mirrors window popped up and allowed me to select newer, faster mirrors. Once I did that, I was able to get Mint updated
 In my Arch VMs (base Arch and ArcoLinux) I needed to update the keyrings. To do that you'll use sudo pacman -Sy archlinux-keyring. This updates all of your keys and should make updating an old Arch based Linux system pretty easy to update after that.
 And that should do it for Debian based and Arch based systems. That's all I use in my VMs. 
 If anyone has any other methods for updating your older VMs you haven't touched in a while like Gentoo, NIXos, Suse, or anything else, please let us know what you do to fix any mirror update issues.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Twitter 公开推荐算法源代码，马斯克获特别优待

Twitter 终于如约 公开 了推荐算法源代码，源代码 托管在 GitHub 上，采用 AGPLv3 许可证。推荐算法控制着出现在 “For You” 中的推文，利用机器学习模型进行排名，过滤掉不良推文和已屏蔽用户的推文等，最后展示到用户的时间线。该代码仓库迅速获得了数十万星标。在代码中，用户发现埃隆·马斯克被专门标出。上个月马斯克的推文曾一度 展示 给几乎所有 Twitter 用户。代码的注解声称这些标签只是用于数据收集的目的。对于这一发现，马斯克本人在 Twitter 上表示将会移除，声称他也是才知道。


消息来源：Ars Technica



老王点评：这是我对马斯克入主 Twitter 之后所做的事情中唯一赞赏的，或许这会带来一个所谓的 “Twitter 2.0”。今天早上我在朋友圈嘲讽道，某个国内的山寨品怕是都不敢用 Twitter 开源出来的算法来改善自己的算法，因为他们的算法是 “MONEY”。




Midjourney 由于新用户过多而暂停免费试用

AI 图像生成服务 Midjourney 已经停止了其服务的免费试用。人们最初认为暂停的原因是，有人利用 Midjourney v5 生成的 AI 图像在社交网络病毒式传播，如前总统特朗普被捕和罗马天主教教皇身穿时尚夹克的照片，让很多人信以为真。但 Midjourney CEO 表示暂停原因是免费用户流量过大，试用遭滥用。他们认为“罪魁祸首可能是中国的一个病毒式的操作视频”和“暂时的 GPU 短缺”。并指出，Midjourney 的免费试用版从未包括访问 Midjourney 最新的第 5 版，而该版本可创建最真实的图像，并被认为是用于这些病毒图片。


消息来源：The Verge



老王点评：看看，其实不是被玩坏了，而是太受欢迎了。




电子游戏行业盛会 E3 2023 取消

今年的电子娱乐博览会（E3）已经被取消了。娱乐软件协会（ESA）和展会发起人 ReedPop 周四晚些时候宣布，计划中的 6 月活动“没有从主要出版商和潜在与会者那里获得必要的持续兴趣”，以证明大规模会议的合理性。这本来该是自 2019 年后第一次现场的 E3 大展。但所有三个主要的游戏机制造商已经确认他们不会参加，而主要的出版商育碧和世嘉最近也公开放弃了这个展会。


消息来源：Ars Technica



老王点评：真是见证了一个时代的落幕，而三年的大流行只是加速了这个过程。]]></summary>

Tekton 是一个用于创建持续集成和持续交付（CI/CD）系统的 Kubernetes 原生开源框架。通过对底层实施细节的抽象，它还可以帮助你在多个云供应商或企业内部系统中进行端到端（构建、测试、部署）应用开发。

Tekton 介绍

Tekton 最初被称为 Knative Build，后来被重组为独立的开源项目，有自己的 治理组织，现在是属于 Linux 基金会 的项目。Tekton 提供了一个集群内的容器镜像构建和部署工作流程，换句话说，它是一个 持续集成continuous integration（CI）和 持续交付continuous delivery（CD）服务。它由 Tekton 流水线和几个支持组件如 Tekton CLI、Triggers 和 Catalog 等组成。

Tekton 是一个 Kubernetes 原生应用。它在 Kubernetes 集群中作为扩展被安装和运行，由一套Kubernetes 定制化资源组成，定义了你为流水线创建和复用的构建块。由于 Tekton 是一种 Kubernetes 原生技术，所以它非常容易扩展。当你需要增加你的工作负载时，你只需向你的集群添加节点就可以了。由于其可扩展的设计和社区贡献的组件库，它也很容易定制。

对于需要 CI/CD 系统来开展工作的开发人员，和为其组织内的开发人员建立 CI/CD 系统的平台工程师，Tekton 是理想选择。

Tekton 组件

构建 CI/CD 流水线的过程非常复杂，因此 Tekton 为每一步都提供工具。以下是 Tekton 提供的主要组件：

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[你一定已经听说过著名的 Vim 文本编辑器。然而，这篇文章是关于它的复刻 Neovim。


Vim 也是 Vi 的一个复刻，这使得 Neovim 成为复刻的复刻。所以，你最终可以使用任何东西，因为它有一些独特的特征。

如果你决定使用 Neovim，让我帮助你在 Ubuntu 和其他 Linux 发行版上开始使用它。

Neovim 概述



Neovim 是一个以其简单的维护和社区贡献而闻名的项目。此外，开发工作很好地分配在多个开发人员之间。

对于最终用户而言，Neovim 的可扩展性远超人们的预期。Neovim 的目标是在不损害 Vim 传统功能的情况下提供更好的应用。

使用 Neovim 的 GUI，你可以获得增强的编辑体验。

Neovim 的特点

虽然你可以在其官方网站及其 GitHub 页面 上探索所有相关信息。让我强调一些特点：


现代图形界面

从多种语言访问 API，包括（C/C++、C#、Go、Haskell、Java/Kotlin、JavaScript/Node.js、Lua、Perl、Python、Ruby、Rust 等等）

嵌入式、可编写脚本的终端仿真器

异步任务控制

多个实例之间的共享数据

XDG 基本目录支持

与大多数 Vim 插件兼容，包括 Ruby 和 Python 插件



💡 我们建议你在开始使用 Vim 和 Neovim 之前，先了解其用法。


在 Ubuntu 和 Linux 上安装 Neovim

由于 Neovim 的流行，安装它很简单。因为 Neovim 在你选择的任何发行版的官方仓库中都可用。


如果你需要，我们还有一个 在 Linux 上安装 Vim 的指南。


要在 Ubuntu 上安装 Neovim，只需单击停靠区中的 Ubuntu 软件图标。然后，搜索 Neovim。你可以根据自己的喜好选择 Snap 或 deb 版本。但是，deb 包版本是过时的 Neovim 版本。



如果你不想要 Snap 版本，你可以从 Neovim 的 Github 发布页 获取最新的 deb 文件。如果你仔细查看发布页面，还有一个 Appimage 文件。

如果你想使用终端而不是 GUI，你可以执行以下操作：

对于基于 Ubuntu 和 Debian 的发行版，输入以下命令进行安装：

sudo apt install neovim


对于 Manjaro 和 Arch Linux，使用以下命令更新你的系统并安装 Neovim：

sudo pacman -Syu neovim


对于 Fedora，使用以下命令：

sudo dnf install -y neovim


要安装 Flatpak，你可以使用此命令：

flatpak install flathub io.neovim.nvim


最后，要安装 Snap 包，请使用以下命令：

sudo snap install nvim --classic


如果你更喜欢从源代码构建软件，请遵循该项目的 Github 页面上给出的 步骤。

如何使用 Neovim

要在安装完成后使用 Neovim，只需从应用菜单启动它，方法是按超级键并输入 neovim。这将打开一个带有 Neovim 的终端窗口。



或者你可以打开你选择的任何终端仿真器并输入以下命令：

nvim


是的，不是 neovim，而是 nvim。例如，要编辑 /etc/fstab，请输入以下命令：

sudo nvim /etc/fstab


现在 fstab 文件将被打开，如下面的截图所示：



如果你无法退出编辑器，请不要担心，按下 Shift+Z+Z。例如，如果此快捷键令人困惑，请使用你需要的键在任何文本编辑器中输入大写的 ZZ 就明白了。

关于这一点，我应该重申，你需要学习 Vim 或 Neovim 并阅读文档才能有效地利用其所有功能。

总结

安装和启动 Neovim 非常简单，但学习它肯定需要一些键盘操作。

这只是编辑器的概述。我不是这方面的专家，但我希望这对所有初学者都有好处！

💬 你使用 Neovim 吗？ 在下面的评论中分享你的经验。

谈到大豆，大概不少人都知道这样一种反差：它是一种“祖籍”中国的作物，在历史上，还有个更加古老的雅号叫做“菽”。然而，在当下世界，美洲却已成为全球最大的大豆产出地，而美国的大豆产量则居于世界第一位——是排名第二的巴西的两倍。这种局面是怎样形成的？这恰恰就是马修·罗思在《魔豆：大豆在美国的崛起》一书里试图告诉读者的。
对国人来说，大豆的好处是不言自明的。清代河南的唯一一位状元吴其濬（1789-1847）在《植物名实图考》里就指出，大豆“种植极繁，始则为蔬，继则为粮，民间不可一日缺者”。当然，今天的大豆早已不是主食（虽然自古它就是“五谷”之一）了，但豆制品譬如豆腐、素鸡、酱油等，都是极其寻常的菜肴与调味品，另外上海的早点有“四大金刚”一说，豆浆也是其中之一。基于这样的印象，罗思在《魔豆》里描述的二十世纪初期大豆在美国的境遇就颇有些难以理解了：1907年，大豆“总栽培面积大概是5万英亩，分散在全美国3亿英亩的农场之中；相比之下，小麦的栽培面积是4500万英亩，燕麦则是3500万英亩”。
这是因为大豆漂洋过海到美国路途遥远姗姗来迟的缘故吗？似乎也不见得。按照罗思的说法，早在1765年，大豆种子被英国东印度公司的一名海员从中国经伦敦带到北美殖民地，并于同年在北美大陆东南沿海的佐治亚的一个农场首次试种。几年后，美国独立的功勋人物，著名外交家、发明家本杰明·富兰克林在出使英国期间也可能获得过大豆的种子，因为他给居住在费城的朋友植物学家约翰·巴特拉姆（John Bartram）寄去了豆种。到了十九世纪，来过中国的传教士与移民美国的亚裔也通过不同的渠道将大豆带到了美国。美国政府在“大豆种子能够大量漂洋过海，实现移栽到美国土地”的过程中扮演了至关重要的角色：1898年，美国农业部植物…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Anyone using GoboLinux at the present time ? I came across it on Tumblr and it is quite different from other distros. Instead of stuff like /usr/bin/, /sbin, /lib as Linux usually is set up, every applications with its dependencies, libraries are all in a sub-directory of its own. For example, /Programs/Gimp/ is on its own, and so is /Programs/Openscad/. There are symlinks to the traditional locations within the operating system.
 It is console centric, everything from the command line, just like the late 1990s. It is almost DYI. 
 I have already downloaded the iso and tried using the live version of the system, it is really different. It almost reminds me of when I installed Slackware 3.4 for the first time on my 486 box. 
 Tonight, I think I will clear off one of the hard drives in my 2009 Mac Pro and do the install of GoboLinux.

The best way to keep it safe going forward, is to have the community own it, so we open sourced it: https://github.com/open-product-data/digital-cameras
I'm aware of a number of attempts to make product data open-sourced, but none have the power of the photo geeks behind it :)
Thoughts or ideas? + really looking for some contribution love.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I switched to Linux about 1,5 years ago. I didn't know much about desktop Linux, and jumped straight into Arch (EndeavourOS) since I'm a developer and all research pointed me to either Arch or Fedora.
 Unfortunately at that time, I had an NVIDIA laptop and Fedora's live-usb refused to boot correctly, so I ditched it right away.
 My journey with Arch was a great learning experience. It thought me a lot about pulseaudio/pipewire, X11/Wayland and many other things, which were really fun to mess with.
 Now that I got rid of my old laptop and built myself an all-AMD PC, I've decided to distrohop for the first time - and wanted to give Fedora a try.
 The switch was an amazing breeze, since I had my user-folder on a separate drive. After adding it to fstab, it was all there, the configs, the themes... just like that.
 I went with Fedora 38, even though it's "beta", it doesn't make me feel like I'm running a beta-ish OS, compared to other "Insider Release" OSes.
 So yeah, I'm a Fedora user now, but admittedly, I still miss the convenience of the AUR, btw.

About me: I spent 15 years designing stamping dies on a high end cad system. During that time, I also developed and marketed extensions/plugins toward that cad system. Through that experience, I came disillusioned with 'vendor lock-in' and proprietary software in general. I basically retired, took the vow of poverty and moved all my computing to open source. I have since, and continue to, try and improve the open source cad environment.

	A lot has changed since 1998. Mozilla is no longer just a bold
	idea. We’re a family of organizations — a nonprofit, a public
	benefit-corporation, and others — that builds products, fuels
	movements, and invests in responsible tech.

	And we’re no longer a small group of engineers in Netscape’s
	Mountain View office. We’re technologists, researchers, and
	activists located around the globe — not to mention tens of
	thousands of volunteers.

	But if a Mozillian from 1998 stepped into a Mozilla office (or
	joined a Mozilla video call) in 2023, I think they’d quickly feel
	something recognizable. A familiar spirit, and a familiar set of

Super excited to be launching on HN, the platform that I personally nerd on and has helped me discover some of my favorite products early.
My cofounder Hemant (@hemantgangolia) has been living in the US since 6 years and has tried multiple times to invest in India. He couldn't go ahead with the process because bank account opening was a challenge and the process after that wasn't clear. There is complexity around taxation, moving money back and a general lack of clarity on where to invest.

 Is it because once you are able to understand the plumbing of the OS you believe you have the right to be more aggressive towards other that never had the change to work on the same things?
 I'm a 100% Linux user/developer for years, but still I get very disappointed when I land into pages like the lkml.org (the linux kernel mailing list management portal) and I see on the home page things like this: 
  
In case you haven't read the titlebar of your webbrowser's window: this site is the (unofficial) Linux Kernel Mailing List archive. This mailing list is a rather high-volume list, where (technical) discussions on the design of, and bugs in the Linux kernel take place. If that scares you, please read the FAQ. 
  
Why that tone?
 Are those people learning from "THE" very prominent individual well known to have public burst of anger?

据界面新闻，美光是存储芯片三巨头之一，其内存、闪存等产品在手机、电脑、服务器等领域广泛使用。集邦咨询数据显示，2022年第四季度，在全球DRAM市场，三星电子、SK海力士和美光科技排在前三名，市占率分别为45.1％、27.7％和23.0％；在NAND市场，美光科技排名第五，市占率为12.3%；三星电子、SK海力士分列第一、第三位，市占率分别为31.4%、18.5%。


3月29日，存储芯片厂商美光公布了2023财年第二财季报告，当季营收为36.9亿美元，上一财季为40.9亿美元，去年同期为77.9亿美元，同比下降约53%。


美光科技第二财季亏损23.1亿美元，其中包含计提超14亿美元的库存损失，每股亏损2.12美元。这是美光过去二十年来最严重的季度亏损，上一次出现如此规模的季度亏损是在2003财年第二财季，当时美光净亏损达19.4亿美元。


美光首席执行官Sanjay Mehrotra宣布，除了高级主管减薪、全面停发2023会计年度奖金外，目前预期整体人力缩减比例将逼近15%（原先预估为10%），措施包括扩大裁员以及2023年12月底前遇缺不补。

开源聊天机器人在质量评估上能达到 ChatGPT 的九成

开源聊天机器人 Vicuna-13B 基于 Meta 的大语言模型 LLaMA，它使用了用户通过 ShareGPT 分享的 7 万对话样本进行微调。研究人员让 OpenAI 的 GPT-4 作为裁判，去对比 Vicuna-13B 以及 ChatGPT 和谷歌 Bard，结果显示它在质量评估中能达到 ChatGPT 的 92%，而 Bard 为 93%，LLaMA 为 68%。Vicuna-13B 的训练成本只花了 300 美元。研究人员还计划释出其模型权重。

老王点评：这说明并一定非得用海量的参数、巨额的训练费用，也可以取得可观的 AI 效果。所以，AI 也会有类似的“摩尔定律”，会随着时间迅速降低 AI 成本和提高 AI 效果。

孙德谦（1869-1935），字受之，又字寿芝，号益葊，晚号隘堪居士，江苏元和（今苏州吴中、相城区）人。历任直隶永年紫山书院山长，江苏存古学堂协教，东吴大学、政治大学、大夏大学等校教授等。著有《古书读法略例》《太史公书义法》《刘向校雠学纂微》《汉书艺文志举例》《诸子通考》《四益宧骈文稿》《六朝丽指》等。今人张京华、黄曙辉编有影印本《孙德谦著作集》，搜罗较全。生平见于王蘧常《元和孙先生行状》、吴丕绩《孙隘堪年谱初稿》等。
孙氏治学，博通四部，尤以治子名世（1928年，孙氏六十岁，曾于病中作自挽联云：“勉为传人，勉为完人，实是苦人，祈死已多年，寿阅六旬，可以休矣；能通经学，能通史学，最深子学，行文工骈体，书刊四部，倘不朽乎？”吴丕绩：《孙隘堪年谱初稿》，《学海》创刊号、第一卷第六期、第二卷第二期，1944年7月、12月，1945年2月）。少从同里雷甘溪治经，喜高邮王念孙、引之“父子之学，兼及声音、训故”（王蘧常：《元和孙先生行状》，《大夏周报》第十二卷第九期《追悼孙德谦先生专号》，1935年12月）。年三十，又病王氏之学琐碎，不能通知大谊，乃转师会稽章学诚，以章氏治史之法治子。九流百家，钩索质验，贯殊析同，撮其指意，斐然有作。自言“生平得力在周秦名家之术，于学问能详加辨析异同得失，咸思核实以求其真”（孙德谦：《答钱子泉先生书》，转引自吴丕绩《孙隘堪年谱初稿》）。弱冠用功于骈文，造诣与李审言媲美，而逸气清空，自成一格。晚年声闻颇宏，被尊为“国学大师”。沈曾植颇为赏识，将其与张尔田、王国维并目为海上“三君”。德国颜复礼、日本福田千代作等亦向风来学。“德意志汉堡大学且以重金求述作，日本宫内省亦访先生书进呈其国主”，海上同文书院尝欲请其前往讲学，狩野直喜亦拟聘其担任中国文化研究…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[你需要一款 ChatGPT 的平替？还得是开源的？看起来我们已经被卷入了与 ChatGPT 的开源大战。




Databricks 这家软件公司，在各个领域都有所建树，尤其是在数据仓库和基于人工智能的解决方案方面。

最近，随着 ChatGPT 横空出世，Meta、谷歌甚至 Mozilla 都开始效仿 ChatGPT。

而现在，Databricks 开源了其 大型语言模型large language model（LLM）“Dolly”，也正在以自己的方式进行尝试。

我们一起来看看它。

发生了什么？ 在最近的公告中，Databricks 介绍了他们号称 “廉价构建” 的 LLM，使用 EleutherAI 的已经开源的参数 模型 提供功能。

他们在该模型基础上稍作调整，赋予了 Dolly 指令诸如头脑风暴和文本生成的能力。

当你拿它与 GPT-3 中的 1750 亿个参数 比较时，Dolly 的 60 亿个参数 就可能显得微不足道。

但是，当 Databricks 的人看到即使数据量与 GPT-3 相差这么多，Dolly 也能 展示很多与 ChatGPT 相同的能力 时，他们感到非常震惊。

下面是他们展示的其中一个例子：



原始模型使用了 Alpaca 的数据，该模型由斯坦福大学以 Meta 的 LLaMA LLM 为基础建立。

但是，正如你所看到的，原始模型产生了一个非常杂乱无章的结果，而 Dolly，通过不同的模型和调整，能够产生一个更为可用的答案。


📝 有趣的事实：“多莉Dolly” 名字取自世界上第一只克隆羊。


为什么是现在？ 根据 Databricks 的说法，他们认为 **许多公司更愿意建立自己的模型，**而不是将数据发送给某个紧紧掌握模型只对外提供 API 的集中式供应商。

许多公司可能不愿意将他们最敏感的数据交给第三方，然后在模型质量、成本和所需行为方面进行各种权衡。

你想看看吗？

当然，但有一个问题。

你必须 使用他们的平台来使用 Dolly，他们已经开源了一个 Databricks 笔记本，可以帮助你在 Databricks 上构建它。

此外，如果你想获得训练好的权重，你必须联系他们。不过我不确定他们是否会免费提供使用权。

总而言之，这种开源其模型的举动应该对其他公司有好处，可以保护他们的数据、节省运营成本，其他公司也能使用它创建自己的模型。

你可以查看其 公告博客，以了解更多技术细节和其他计划。

在等待下个月的 Ubuntu 23.04 吗？

好吧，我们已经提到，在 Ubuntu 23.04 版本的 令人兴奋 的事情中，包括一个新的官方的 Cinnamon 风味（它最初是 Ubuntu Cinnamon Remix）。

而且，它**现在是官方版本*，因为 Ubuntu 的技术委员会以足够的票数 批准了它。

Ubuntu Cinnamon 23.04 值得期待的地方



如果你之前已经使用过 Ubuntu Cinnamon Remix（非官方），你可能对它有点概念了。

如果你想要一个带有 Cinnamon 桌面的 Ubuntu 风味版，而没有众多的特殊定制，Ubuntu Cinnamon 适合你。

而另一方面，Linux Mint 也是一个基于 Ubuntu 的 Cinnamon 桌面。然而，你会得到一个 Mint 特有的主题、图标、工具和调整，体验有所不同。

基本上，如果你使用 Linux Mint，它不会让你感觉到 “只是另一种 Ubuntu 风味”。

别忘了，Linux Mint 默认禁用 Snap，而且是 Flatpak 优先的，这与 Ubuntu Cinnamon 23.04 的情况完全相反。



所以，如果你喜欢使用 Snap 而不是 Flatpak，并且喜欢 Ubuntu 通常的风味版的工作方式，Ubuntu Cinnamon 是一个不错的补充。关于这个版本的其他一些值得注意的地方包括：


预装的应用程序，如 Synaptic Package Manager、LibreOffice 等

Ubuntu 的 Yaru 主题

没有像你期望的 Linux Mint 那样的 XApp


目前，根据其 最新的日常构建，Ubuntu Cinnamon 23.04 几乎已经准备好发布（将于下个月发布）。

它是否会赢得 Linux Mint 用户的青睐，那是另外一个故事。但是，Ubuntu 上的新 Cinnamon 版应该会让更多的用户尝试 Cinnamon 桌面，这是件好事。

Cinnamon 桌面融合了传统 Windows 风格的布局，并提供了更多的功能。

你可以在 Ubuntu Cinnamon 博客 上阅读官方公告。

你考虑改用 Ubuntu Cinnamon 作为你的首选口味吗？请在评论中分享你的想法。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Unix philosophy, originated by Ken Thompson, is a set of cultural norms and philosophical approaches to minimalist, modular software development.
  
-This doesn't apply just to command line applications like piping ls into dir, cat into bat, or man into tldr.
 A good example is how some web browsers will develop their own PiP video player, while another just gives you suggestions for how to play video using MPV or VLC. That web browser could also incorporate yt-dlp, and so can MPV. A file browser can send information to a CLI based disk burner to burn an iso or data, or transfer files to your phone through kdeconnect-cli or to google drive through their cli interface in the background.
 2 programs I use very heavily that are very modular like this are LF and Qutebrowser. -Curious what others are using that follow the Unix philosophy.

Most LLM apps can be built by properly integrating LLMs with a knowledge base consisting of domain-specific or company-specific data. The scope of this knowledge base can change based on the task- it can be something as narrow and static as your API docs or as broad and fluid as meeting transcripts from your customer support calls.
To effectively use their data, most teams need to build a similar stack—datasource integrations, async embedding jobs, vector databases, bucket storage for non textual data, a way to versio…]]></summary>

Getting from a product idea to a design is too hard. Wireframing tools (e.g. Balsamiq) are limited and their output is too low-fidelity to get people excited about the idea. On the other hand, high-fidelity design tools (e.g. Figma) require advanced skills and are better for tweaking fine details than hashing out a big picture. Meanwhile, companies have an insatiable need to make new screens and change existing ones, and hiring more designers is time-consuming and expensive.
David and I were on the design tools team at Airbnb when we realized there’s another solution: let designers encode their knowledge (e.g. design rules …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[一封有关暂停训练高级人工智能（AI）的公开信日前引发热议。路透社30日报道称，这封公开信的主要内容是呼吁在6个月内暂停高级人工智能的开发。理由是AI可能对社会和文明构成潜在风险。目前已有1000多名科技界和AI领域的重量级人物签署公开信，其中包括特斯拉首席执行官马斯克、苹果公司联合创始人沃兹尼亚克、Stability AI总裁莫斯塔克、AI企业DeepMind的多名研究员。


《华尔街日报》援引该公开信背后的组织者之一泰格马克的话表示，AI的进展已超过许多专家几年前认为可能达到的程度。他说，“这就像是一场自杀式竞赛，谁先到并不重要，重要的是整个人类有可能会失去对自己命运的控制。”泰格马克表示，6个月的暂停开发将让整个行业获得“喘息之机”，那些选择谨慎行动的公司并不会处于劣势。


尽管已有1000多人在公开信上签字，但诸多业内人士提出不同意见。Meta副总裁兼首席AI科学家勒邱恩表示，因为不认同这封信的前提条件，他没有在这封信上签名。而Stability AI首席执行官莫斯塔克则发推文称，虽然自己已在信上签名，但他不赞同暂停开发6个月的提议。同时，据美国CNBC网站29日报道，谷歌也并未受到这封公开信的影响，其正在重组虚拟助手部门，以更加专注于开发人工智能聊天技术Bard。


信中称，我们目前开发的高级人工智能正在对人类社会造成威胁，各大AI实验室之间的竞争已经失控，然而，包括AI的创造者在内，没有人能理解、预测或可靠地控制它们。


“我们是否应该把所有工作都自动化，包括那些有成就感的工作？我们是否该开发机器大脑，让它们比人脑还多，比人脑还聪明，最终淘汰我们取代我们？我们是否应该冒文明失控的风险？”信中诘问道。


这些问题已经摆在我们面前，但我们没有做好准备。


因此，这封公开信呼吁所有人立即暂停AI研究至少六个月，然后加速制定安全协议，此…]]></summary>

英国精神分析专家达里安·利德（Darian Leader）的《手的精神史》（Hands,2016；邹宏宇译，北京联合出版公司，2022年9 月）是一本饶有趣味的小书，可以很快读完，但是余味不断。原书名只是《手》，复数的“手”，可能会令读者一下子不知道它讲什么。中译本加上“精神史”是一个有效的指引，但是所谓“精神史”也并不准确，看完之后我想还可以叫做手的“文化史”或“社会史”。不过，其实也谈不上“史”，说是有知识性和思想性的随笔更准确一些。当然，很重要的是书后有非常丰富的、与正文内容对应的“参考文献”，可以保证它的学术品位。作者在书后的“致谢”说是“把想法转变为文字”，也是很朴实的说法。开始的时候我试图把它与身体史研究、情感史研究联系起来，读完时发现更接近社会文化研究中关于身体（手）的漫谈。有意思的是，当作者的朋友听说他要写一本关于手的书的时候，几乎异口同声地说“啊！一本关于手淫的书啊！”（87页）他说这种联想有些难以对付，结果他只好真的用一章来写与手淫有关的手。看来，关于手的联想也是蛮有意思的，就如利德说的，手即便放在裤兜里也不要乱动。
顺带要说的是，社会学家如何观察公共场所中的手。作者举的一个例子很有意思：社会学家欧文·戈夫曼注意到在拥挤的地铁上，有些站在女乘客身旁的男性会不自觉地将手举得高高地抓住头上的拉手杆子，以“这种奇怪而又不舒服的姿势证明了双手无罪，似乎是在暗示，‘无论发生什么，都不是我的手干的’”（79页）。这是“邪恶”的身体欲望与自证“清白”的双手联袂上演的哑剧，是在内发性道德规训约束下的手工活。
在世俗生活中，人类的身体总是要反抗灵魂对它的压抑和贬斥。但是在思想与学术的场域上，以身体书写的真理总是被以灵魂书写的思想与学术重重…]]></summary>

清代学者叶昌炽在其碑版学名著《语石》中曾经评说：“集字始于怀仁，唐以前犹未闻也。集右军书者多矣，惟《圣教序》钩心斗角，天衣无缝。”不仅誉其为集字成碑的开创之举，更推其为集王诸碑的最佳之作。并指出：“唐太宗喜右军书，至以《禊帖》殉昭陵。上之所好，遂移风尚。怀仁《圣教序》出，举世奉为圭臬。”又引清初书法名家王澍《竹云题跋》中语曰：“怀仁《圣教》……匪直《兴福寺》《隆禅法师》碑为显效其体，即李北海、张司直、苏武功，亦皆从此夺胎。”认为唐代李邕、张从申、苏灵芝等以行书写碑并形成风气，均与《集王圣教序》有关。及至宋代，学者黄伯思（1079-1118）在其《东观余论》中…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Windows 11 给开始菜单加入广告

在微软为 Windows 11 发布的 3 月份的非安全预览补丁 KB5023778 中，在开始菜单为微软账号引入了通知。该补丁是可选的，以帮助 Windows 管理员测试将在下个月的补丁星期二推出的改进。所谓的“账号通知”你可以看做是微软自己的产品广告，比如建议用户使用 OneDrive 备份文件。该功能首先提供给一小部分用户，未来几个月再推广给更多用户。


消息来源：Bleeping Computer



老王点评：操作系统厂商现在都喜欢在操作系统里放广告，就好像剩下苹果没有这样做了。




微软发布基于 OpenAI 的聊天工具以对抗网络攻击

微软最新的人工智能助理工具使用了 GPT-4 语言系统和安全领域的特定数据。它可以帮助安全工作者更迅速地看到黑客的各个部分之间的联系，如可疑的电子邮件、恶意软件文件或系统中被破坏的部分。微软几年来一直在使用机器学习技术来根除可疑的行为和发现漏洞，但最新的人工智能技术可以提供更快的分析，并增加了使用普通英语描述问题的能力。


消息来源：彭博社



老王点评：毕竟黑客们都已经开始用 AI 来进行攻击了。




微软正在开发一个能与 ChromeOS 竞争的下一代操作系统

该项目代号为 CorePC，旨在成为一个模块化和可定制的 Windows 变体，采用了许多与 Windows Core OS 相同的创新。并非所有的 Windows PC 都需要对传统 Win32 应用程序的全面支持，CorePC 将允许微软配置具有不同功能和应用程序兼容性水平的 Windows “版本”。与目前的 Windows 版本相比，最大的变化是 CorePC 是状态分离的，这可以使更新速度更快，并通过用户和第三方应用程序无法访问的只读分区提供一个更安全的平台，就像 iPadOS 或安卓一样。CorePC 将使微软最终能够提供一个在操作系统尺寸、性能和功能上真正与 ChromeOS 竞争的 Windows 版本。


消息来源：Windows Central



老王点评：看来今天这期是微软专辑了。微软虽然一直在尝试将 Windows 装到 PC 之外，但都没有什么好的结果，不知道这次尝试会如何。]]></summary>

Everything Open 2023 was given
by Professor Rebecca Giblin of the Melbourne Law School, University of

around her recent book, Chokepoint Capitalism,
which she wrote with Cory Doctorow; it is "a book about why creative
labor markets are rigged — and how to unrig them".  Giblin had planned
to be in Melbourne to give her talk in person, but "the universe had other
plans"; she got delayed in Austin,
Texas by an unexpected speaking slot at the South by 
Southwest (SXSW)

 Snaps were slow initially but my recent installation and use has been nothing but smooth.
 Ubuntu is a very stable distro and using the backports ppa to get latest Plasma was a joy yo use. I also bought into the FUD about Ubuntu being slow and corporate now, but it was really good honestly. I'll keep it now for foreseeable future.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey HN! I just released go-nbd, a lightweight Go library for effortlessly creating NBD servers and clients. Its a neat tool for creating custom Linux block devices with arbitrary backends, such as a file, byte slice or what I'm planning to use it for, a tape drive. While there are a few partially abandoned projects like this out there already, this library tries to be as maintainable as possible by only implementing the most recent handshake revision and baseline functionality for both the client and the server, while still having enough support to be useful.
I'd love to get your feedback :)

Vocode makes it easy to take any text-based LLM and make it voice-based. Our repo is at https://github.com/vocodedev/vocode-python and our docs are at https://docs.vocode.dev.
Building realtime voice apps with LLMs is powerful but hard. You have to orchestrate the speech recognition, LLM, and speech synthesis in real-time (all async)–while handling the complexity of conversation (like understanding when someone is finished speaking or handling interruptions).
Our library is easy to get up and running–you can set up a conversation in https://replit.com/@vocode/Gen-Z-Phone (try it out at +1-650-729-9536).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Might be a bit vague of what "API-driven" means, but essentially it would mean that you would have small services tasked with both handling and provided internal apis for other software to use (and if you're concern with malware, you could use api keys to at least make it a bit harder).
 Like for instance if you want to backup your configurations, you could call an api to retrieve all said configurations and then back it up, instead of having to manually figure out which config file or where said config file is.
 You could also use same API to make changes to a specific config file from different applications (could still have the config file be text-based so you could do manual edits if you want).
 To be fair this is already slowly happening with how common software from pulseaudio to systemd provide both a service and an API.
 I need to stress I'm not saying pipeline & "everything is a file" should be completely deprecated, there will of course be exceptions, but these days I feel that there's less of a direct need for pipelines since in general most software are a bit more well designed to make you only need 2-3 commands to do the task and if you do need to do a lot of bulky operations there's a lot more options than shell script with pipeline glue (like ansible).
 TL;DR Pipeline was amazing when it came out given the huge limitation on computing back then, but since then like with the unix filesystem hierarchy standard (like what gobolinux and NixOS is changing) it's increasingly become less relevant with better options/suggestions.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[程序员可以通过 Flatpak 轻松、稳定地发布他们的软件，让他们专注于他们的激情工作：编程。




如今，人们比以往任何时候都喜爱 Linux。在这个系列中，我将分享使用 Linux 的 21 个不同理由。今天，我将谈一谈是什么让 Linux 的打包成为程序员的理想选择。

程序员喜欢编程。这可能看起来是一个显而易见的说法，但重要的是要明白，开发软件所涉及的不仅仅是编写代码。它包括编译、文档、源代码管理、安装脚本、配置默认值、支持文件、交付格式等等。从一个空白的屏幕到一个可交付的软件安装程序，需要的不仅仅是编程，但大多数程序员宁愿编程也不愿打包。

什么是打包？

当食物被送到商店购买时，它是被包装好的。当直接从农民或从环保的散装或桶装商店购买时，包装是你所带的任何容器。当从杂货店购买时，包装可能是一个纸板箱、塑料袋、一个铁罐等等。

当软件被提供给广大计算机用户时，它也必须被打包起来。像食品一样，软件也有几种打包方式。开源软件可以不进行打包，因为用户在获得原始代码后，可以自己编译和打包它。然而，打包也有好处，所以应用程序通常以某种特定于用户平台的格式交付。而这正是问题的开始，因为软件包的格式并不只有一种。

对于用户来说，软件包使安装软件变得容易，因为所有的工作都由系统的安装程序完成。软件被从软件包中提取出来，并分发到操作系统中的适当位置。几乎没有任何出错的机会。

然而，对于软件开发者来说，打包意味着你必须学会如何创建一个包 —— 而且不仅仅是一个包，而是为你希望你的软件可以安装到的每一个操作系统创建一个独特的包。更加复杂的是，每个操作系统都有多种打包格式和选项，有时甚至是不同的编程语言。

为 Linux 打包

传统上，Linux 的打包方式似乎是非常多的。从 Fedora 衍生出来的 Linux 发行版，如 Red Hat 和 CentOS，默认使用 .rpm 包。Debian 和 Ubuntu（以及类似的）默认使用 .deb 包。其他发行版可能使用其中之一，或者两者都不使用，选择自定义的格式。当被问及时，许多 Linux 用户说，理想情况下，程序员根本不会为 Linux 打包他们的软件，而是依靠每个发行版的软件包维护者来创建软件包。所有安装在 Linux 系统上的软件都应该来自该发行版的官方软件库。然而，目前还不清楚如何让你的软件可靠地被一个发行版打包和包含，更不用说所有的发行版了。

Linux 的 Flatpak

Flatpak 打包系统是为了统一和去中心化 Linux 作为开发者的交付目标而推出的。通过 Flatpak，无论是开发者还是其他人（Linux 社区的成员、不同的开发者、Flatpak 团队成员或其他任何人）都可以自由地打包软件。然后他们可以将软件包提交给 Flathub，或者选择自我托管软件包，并将其提供给几乎任何 Linux 发行版。Flatpak 系统适用于所有 Linux 发行版，所以针对一个发行版就等于针对所有发行版。

Flatpak 技术如何工作

Flatpak 具有普遍吸引力的秘密是一个标准基础。Flatpak 系统允许开发者引用一套通用的软件开发者工具包（SDK）模块。这些模块由 Flatpak 系统的维护者进行打包和管理。当你安装 Flatpak 时，SDK 会根据需要被拉入，以确保与你的系统兼容。任何特定的 SDK 只需要一次，因为它所包含的库可以在任何 Flatpak 中共享。

如果开发者需要一个尚未包含在现有 SDK 中的库，开发者可以在 Flatpak 中添加该库。

结果不言自明。用户可以从一个叫做 Flathub 的中央仓库在任何 Linux 发行版上安装数百个软件包。

开发者如何使用 Flatpak

Flatpak 被设计成可重复的，所以构建过程很容易被集成到 CI/CD 工作流程中。Flatpak 是在一个 YAML 或 JSON 清单文件中定义的。你可以按照我的 介绍性文章 创建你的第一个 Flatpak，你也可以在 docs.flatpak.org 阅读完整的文档。

Linux 让它变得简单

在 Linux 上创建软件很容易，为 Linux 打包也很简单，而且可以自动化。如果你是一个程序员，Linux 使你很容易忘记打包这件事，因为它只需要针对一个系统，并可以整合到你的构建过程中。

popular distributions creating their own immutable versions; it
could be 
one of the trends of 2023, as

distributions are focused on server use, there are also some that offer a
desktop experience. OpenSUSE MicroOS
Desktop is one of them, with a minimal openSUSE Tumbleweed as the
base operating system and applications running as Flatpaks or in containers. In its daily use,
it feels a lot like a normal openSUSE desktop. Its biggest benefit is
availability of the newest software releases without sacrificing system

some frustrations with the vulnerability notification policies
maintained by the distros mailing list.


	The week before we were about to ship the curl 8.0.0 release, I
	emailed the distros mailing list again like I have done so many
	times before and told them about the upcoming six(!)
	vulnerabilities we were about to reveal to the world.

	This time turned out to be different.

	Because of our updated policy where the fixes were already
	committed in a public git repository, the distros mailing list’s
	policy says that if there is a public commit they consider the
	issue to be public and thus they refuse to accept any embargo.

	What they call embargo I of course call heads-up time.

issues in the past.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[马斯克等人呼吁暂停训练更强大的 AI

埃隆·马斯克和一群人工智能专家、行业高管在一封公开信中说，他们呼吁至少在六个月内暂停训练比 OpenAI 的 GPT-4 更强大的系统，并呼吁政府介入。其理由是对社会和人类的潜在风险。这份公开信有 1000 多人签名，除了马斯克，还包括 DeepMind 的研究人员、开发稳定扩散 AIGC 的公司 CEO 等等。他们认为需要先制定、实施并由独立专家审核的共享安全协议。OpenAI 没有参与签名，也没有置评。

今天还有一则消息称，马斯克离开 OpenAI 是由于夺权失败。马斯克曾承诺赞助 10 亿美元给 OpenAI，但赞助 1 亿美元后离开了 OpenAI 就没有继续赞助。


消息来源：路透社



老王点评：签署这封信的人可能大多出于公义，但是 AI 这个魔盒打开，恐怕是难以这样轻易关上的。




英伟达表示加密货币没有给社会带来任何有用的东西

英伟达的显卡曾经被大量用来挖掘以太坊之类的加密货币，由于被大量抢购，英伟达一度限制过其显卡的挖矿能力。英伟达也曾推出挖矿专用的显卡，并从中获利甚丰。但随着以太坊转向 POS 共识，不再需要显卡来挖矿，这一市场几乎马上消失了。如今该公司的 CTO 称，加密货币没有 “给社会带来任何有用的东西。……处理能力的其他用途，如人工智能聊天机器人 ChatGPT，比挖掘加密货币更有价值。”第一个版本的 ChatGPT 是在一台由大约 10,000 块英伟达显卡组成的超级计算机上训练的。


消息来源：《卫报》



老王点评：这翻脸可真快啊。




英国设置假的 DDoS 雇佣网站以扰乱市场

英国国家犯罪署建立了虚假的 DDoS 雇佣网站，试图收集用户的信息，提醒他们发动 DDoS 攻击是非法的。这些看起来像提供了使网络罪犯能够实施这些攻击的工具和服务的虚假网站，迄今已有数千人访问过。然而，在用户注册后，在英国的用户将被国家犯罪署或警方联系，并被警告参与网络犯罪。与设在海外的用户有关的信息将被传递给国际执法部门。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[通过开源项目 AdGuard Home 运行你自己的 DNS 服务器来控制你的互联网隐私。


域名服务器（DNS）将域名（如 example.com）与 IP 地址（如 93.184.216.34）相关联。这就是当你输入 URL 或搜索引擎返回 URL 供你访问时，你的网络浏览器如何知道在世界的哪个地方寻找数据。DNS 为互联网用户提供了极大的便利，但也并非没有缺点。例如，付费广告会出现在网页上，因为你的浏览器会自然的使用 DNS 来解析这些广告在互联网上“存在”的位置。同样，跟踪你在线活动的软件通常由通过 DNS 解析的服务启用。你不想完全关闭 DNS，因为它非常有用。但是你可以运行自己的 DNS 服务，以便更好地控制它的使用方式。

我相信运行自己的 DNS 服务器至关重要，这样你就可以阻止广告并保持你的浏览隐私，远离试图分析你的在线交互的提供商。我过去用过 Pi-hole，今天仍然推荐它。然而，最近，我一直在我的网络上运行开源项目 AdGuard Home。我发现它有一些值得探索的独特功能。

AdGuard Home

在我使用过的开源 DNS 软件中，AdGuard Home 是最容易设置和维护的。你可以在一个项目中获得许多 DNS 解析解决方案，例如 DNS over TLS、DNS over HTTPS 和 DNS over QUIC。

你可以使用一个脚本将 AdGuard 设置为容器或本地服务：

$ curl -s -S -L \
    https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AdguardTeam/AdGuardHome/master/scripts/install.sh


查看这个脚本以便了解它的作用。了解了它的工作过程后，再运行它：

$ sh ./install.sh


我最喜欢 AdGuard Home 的一些功能：


一个简单的管理界面

使用 AdGuard 阻止列表来阻止广告和恶意软件

单独配置网络上每个设备的选项

强制在特定设备上进行安全搜索

为管理界面设置 HTTPS，这样与它的远程交互是完全加密的


我发现 AdGuard Home 为我节省了时间。它的黑名单比 Pi-hole 上的黑名单更强大。你可以快速轻松地将其配置为 DNS over HTTPS。

没有更多的恶意软件

恶意软件是你计算机上不需要的内容。它并不总是对你有直接危险，但它可能会为第三方带来危险活动。这不是互联网最初的目的。我认为你应该托管自己的 DNS 服务，以保护你的互联网历史记录的私密性，并避免被微软、谷歌和亚马逊等已知跟踪器掌握。在你的网络上试用 AdGuard Home 吧。

按照特拉维夫大学历史学教授施罗默·桑德（Shlomo Sand）在《法国知识分子的终结？从左拉到维勒贝克》一书中的看法，作为法国公共知识分子代表的伏尔泰、左拉以及萨特、福柯等人堪称法兰西的“牛虻”——正如先贤苏格拉底自称他是“雅典城邦的牛虻”。与之相对的则是以当代小说家维勒贝克等人为代表的“媒体知识分子”——他们以文艺创作积累的声望为资本，热衷于各种媒体访谈、演讲，心甘情愿充当权力的辩护士甚至代言人。在勾勒启蒙运动以来法国知识分子从伟大到衰落乃至终结的全过程之后，桑德教授得出结论：在信息碎片化、知识浅薄化以及信奉“娱乐至上”法则的当下，知识分子与当权者已成为“共谋”，因此即便在法兰西这片盛产“牛虻”的土壤里，也很难再产生“真正的公共知识分子”。
本书由伏尔泰开篇。1878年，长期流亡海外的作家雨果在巴黎“纪念伏尔泰逝世一百周年集会”上发表演讲，赞扬伏尔泰是十八世纪法国社会正义和良知的化身，是法兰西这个庞然大物身上的“牛虻”：“啊，伏尔泰！你发出痛恨的呼喊，它是你的永恒的荣誉！你投身于对过去的惊人的审判；你反驳暴君和恶魔，这是人类的事业，你赢得了它。”雨果此处提及的“人类的事业”，即伏尔泰晚年奋不顾身为之奔走呼号的“卡拉斯事件”。
1761年，胡格诺派教徒卡拉斯因莫须有的谋杀（天主教徒）罪被判处极刑，激起伏尔泰满腔义愤——他一方面向包括国王情妇蓬帕杜夫人在内的宫廷显贵求助，一方面撰写雄文《论宽容》（“我虽然不同意你的观点，但我誓死捍卫你说话的权利”据说是文中流传最广的一句格言），从而使得这一事件“成为整个欧洲瞩目的焦点”。熟谙中国文化的伏尔泰在文中首先指出：人权和天赋权利的首要和普遍原则，在全世界范围都大致相同，即“己所不欲，勿施于…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[OpenWrt 是一个基于 Linux 的开源操作系统，主要针对嵌入式网络设备。


如果你在家里阅读这篇文章，你可能是用一个 LTE/5G/DSL/WIFI 路由器联网的。这种设备通常负责在你的本地设备（智能手机、PC、电视等）之间路由数据包，并通过内置的调制解调器提供对 WWW 的访问。你家里的路由器很可能有一个基于网页的界面，用于配置该设备。这种界面往往过于简单，因为它们是为普通用户制作的。

如果你想要更多的配置选项，但又不想花钱买一个专业的设备，你应该看看其他的固件，如 OpenWrt。

OpenWrt 的特点

OpenWrt 是一个基于 Linux 的、针对嵌入式网络设备的开源操作系统。它主要用于替代各种家用路由器上的原始固件。OpenWrt 具备一个好的路由器应该具备的所有有用功能，如 DNS 服务器（dnsmasq），WiFi 接入点（AP）和客户端功能，用于调制解调器功能的 PPP 协议，而且，与标准固件不同，这一切都是可以完全配置的。

LuCI 网页界面

OpenWrt 可以通过命令行（SSH）或使用 GUI 配置界面（LuCI）进行远程配置。LuCI 是一个用 Lua 编写的轻量级、可扩展的网页 GUI，它可以精确地配置你的设备。除了配置，LuCI 还提供了很多额外的信息，如实时图表、系统日志和网络诊断。



LuCI 有一些可选的扩展，以增加更多的配置选择。

可写文件系统

它的另一个亮点是可写文件系统。原有的固件通常是只读的，而 OpenWrt 配备了一个可写的文件系统，这要归功于一个巧妙的解决方案，它将 OverlayFS 与 SquashFS/JFFS2 文件系统相结合，允许安装软件包以增强功能。在 OpenWrt 文档 中可以找到更多关于文件系统架构的信息。

OpenWrt 有一个相关的软件包管…]]></summary>

 It feels like a low hanging fruit to me and even if adoption is slow, it would definitely be awesome to see some applications add more actions in the notification dialog.

Flatpak package format has gained popularity among Linux users

convenience and ease of use. Canonical will focus exclusively on its own

decision has caused disgruntlement
among some community members, who felt like the distribution was making
this decision

又一家安全机构确认某应用的非谷歌商店版本包含恶意代码

本月早些时候，独立安全研究机构 DarkNavy 发表文章披露，中国某个移动应用利用了安卓系统的零日漏洞提权使其难以卸载。上周，谷歌将该公司的多个应用 标记为 恶意程序并下架。被指的公司发表声明反对对其应用的恶意推测和指控。现在，又一家安全公司 Lookout 对该应用的两个非谷歌商店版本进行了分析，确认了 DarkNavy 的指控。被利用的漏洞是谷歌在 3 月 6 日公开并修复的，利用该漏洞可以提权，而且整个过程不需要用户交互。目前没有证据表明该应用的谷歌商店和苹果应用商店版本含有恶意代码，但通过第三方市场下载的则不能保证。

ARM 想要改变芯片授权模式来增加收入

ARM 目前主要依赖于芯片授权协议，每季度的收入在 5 亿美元左右。为了提高收入，ARM 据称准备彻底改变芯片授权模式，以大幅增加授权费用。ARM 考虑停止向芯片制造商收取授权费用，而是转而向设备制造商收费，其费用将基于产品的总价。ARM 计划在 2024 年推动新的模式，据称手机厂商对此持抵制态度。此举可能推动手机厂商拥抱免授权费的开放架构 RISC-V。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[介绍最新的 Ubuntu 23.04 “Lunar Lobster” 版本，它包含了大量的新功能和改进。


代号为 “月球龙虾Lunar Lobster” 的 Ubuntu 23.04 是 2023 年的第一个短期版本，它将被支持 9 个月，直到 2024 年 1 月。这个版本采用了新的软件包和技术来改进 Ubuntu 的核心后台和进展工作。在某种程度上，许多变化是作为明年的 LTS 版本（Ubuntu 24.04）的准备工作而被确定的。

它的开发周期几乎接近结束。截至发稿时，测试版已经冻结。所以，现在是探索这个版本的新功能的好时机。

但在此之前，先来看看即将到来的里程碑：


测试版冻结： 2023 年 3 月 27 日

测试版发布： 2023 年 3 月 30 日

候选版本：2023 年 4 月 13 日

最终版本：2023 年 4 月 20 日




Ubuntu 23.04 的新功能

新的桌面安装程序

Ubuntu 新的基于 Rust 的桌面安装程序终于可以在这个版本中体验了。这项工作历经了两年多的时间。在经历了许多障碍和关键错误的修复后，现在已经稳定到可以在正式版本中发布。从这个版本开始，经典的 Ubiquity 被全新的安装程序所取代，如下面一组图片所示：









然而，正如我从一些消息来源听到的，旧的 Uqiuity 将继续保留（直到明年）。但我不完全确定旧的安装程序将如何启动。因为默认的 立付介质Live Media 会启动新的安装程序。

与旧安装程序的相比，新的有一些变化。首先，相对于旧的 Uqiuity 对话框和小工具控制，外观和感觉更加现代。

关于分区的摘要细节现在作为一个单独的页面出现，而不是一个弹出框。

此外，Ubuntu 23.04 现在在安装前会询问深色/浅色模式选项…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[3月28日上午，国务院新闻办公室举行新闻发布会，介绍2023年“清朗”系列专项行动有关情况。国家互联网信息办公室违法和不良信息举报中心主任申月表示，营商网络环境是企业营商环境的重要组成部分。今年，国家网信办准备开展“清朗·优化营商网络环境 保护企业合法权益”专项行动，聚焦网上破坏营商环境的典型问题、突出问题，开展集中专项治理，完善长效工作机制。


当前，网上针对企业和企业家，特别是针对民营企业和民营企业家的各类虚假不实信息时有出现，损害企业品牌形象，侵害企业家合法权益，甚至影响了企业的正常生产经营，导致企业蒙受经济损失，企业家遭受名誉侵害。


申月介绍，专项行动将突出两个重点：一是着力维护企业和企业家的网络合法权益；二是着力治理编造传播虚假不实信息的网络乱象。


专项行动具体开展三方面治理工作：


一是依法依规及时处置网上涉企业的六大类虚假不实信息，具体包括捏造事实、主观臆断、歪曲解读、恶意关联、蓄意炒作和翻炒旧闻等。


二是依法依规处置网上涉企业家的六大类侵权信息，具体包括泄露个人隐私、诋毁侮辱谩骂、虚构私生活话题、关联炒作负面新闻、捏造违法犯罪事实、违规使用姓名肖像等。


三是严厉打击网上恶意损害企业和企业家形象声誉，甚至从中牟取非法利益的违法违规行为。


申月提到，为确保这次专项行动取得实效，我们之前做了深入研究，计划从三方面着力开展工作：


一是强化存量信息处置。指导网站平台集中开展排查，全面清理存量，对于已经被认定为谣言的信息，涉及企业家个人隐私的信息和显性侵权信息要及时处置，对于问题突出的账号进行处置处罚。


二是强化维权工作机制。我们会进一步畅通举报渠道、细化处置标准、优化工作流程，线上线下配合，为企业和企业家举报维权做好服务保障。同时，我们指导网站平台加强搜索联想词管理，高效处置涉企业问题的相关线索。


三是强化集中督导曝光。专项行动期间，我们会及时公布破坏营商网络环境的违法违规案例。对于工作落实不力的网站平台，我们也会指导属地网信部门加强检查督导。最后也欢迎社会各界对我们的工作提出宝贵的意见建议。

对于欧洲以外的人来说，当代德国常常会让他们感到困惑或惊讶。例如，为什么德国人不太愿意为自己的国家感到骄傲，更倾向于认同自己是“欧洲人”而非“德国人”？在涉及军事援助乌克兰的问题上，为什么德国人最初持更为谨慎的态度？此外，在民粹主义盛行的时代，为什么曾经出现过纳粹政权的德国反而成为西方世界最稳定的力量呢？
要理解德国人对民族主义、战争和暴力的态度，关键在于他们在二十世纪，尤其是上半叶所经历的历史。德裔美国历史学家康拉德·H.雅劳施（Konrad H. Jarausch）所著的《破碎的生活：普通德国人经历的20世纪》一书或许能为我们带来一些启示。
这本书不是一本抽象的历史学分析和概论，而是基于七十多位出生于一战结束和纳粹上台之前的德国人（或称“魏玛共和国时期的出生者”）的回忆录所描绘的这一代德国人在二十世纪所经历的日常生活。柏林墙倒塌后，许多德国退休老人开始撰写回忆录，回忆自己在二十世纪所经历的战争、逃亡和灾难。这些自传性文字大多作为私人的家族记忆留存下来。其中一些人希望在回忆录里向他们的后代讲述家族的背景以及自己在二十世纪惊心动魄的经历，字里行间常带有说教的口吻；而另一些人则将其作为一种心理疗愈的方式，希望通过解释过去为某些曾经的人生选择辩护。
雅劳施致力于根据这些普通人的回忆，将许多个不同的个体命运和集体叙事融为一体，撰写一个世代的集体传记（第3页）。在书的一开始，他列出了本书中将会出现的七十多位主人公的个人简介，其中着墨最多的所谓“核心人物”（在书中被提及八十次以上的）有十七位。从社会阶层来看，有百分之十的样本来自工人阶级，大多数依然是中上层阶级和小资产阶级，其中至少百分之十是在知识分子圈中已知名的人，如彼得·盖伊、约阿希…]]></summary>

余华和毛尖

毛尖：全国人民都知道，洪治纲老师比你自己更了解你，他说，你早期的作品不止十五篇，有一些用了笔名，你是不是悔过两三篇少作？
余华：我在《十八岁出门远行》之前的作品，我是希望你们都忘掉的。但洪治纲非要把它找出来，还要做研究。我希望我把我美好的形象展现给读者。现在我北师大的学生跟我说，他们在读《十八岁出门远行》之前的作品。为什么呢？为了寻找自信。老师当年也写得那么幼稚，那我们不也还有前途吗？所以我觉得也挺好。但是我告诉他们不要继续传播了。
毛尖：大家都说，现在你的销量已经比鲁迅还要好了。你觉得你比鲁迅牛了吗？
余华：鲁迅是海归派，我是赤脚医生。谁能跟鲁迅比？我觉得鲁迅太了不起。
毛尖：这次参会好几个批评家提出，你小说最后都有一个温情的东西托着底，你承认吗？
余华：这个我承认，没有温情的东西我写不下去。因为写作也是自我调节，是一个治疗的过程。假如我哪个地方写得很狠，另一个地方一定要有温情的东西出来，要不就很难维持下去。
毛尖：这次华师大的会是你人生中第几个作品讨论会？
余华：第三个，因为我真的不太喜欢讨论会。我倒不是害怕批评，因为像我这种脸皮那么厚的人，批评已经用处不大了。我印象中第一个讨论会是关于《兄弟》的。《兄弟》出来以后，争议很大，当然也有一些支持的声音，但支持的声音比较弱，复旦是属于支持的一波。其实我知道，复旦里面也不都是支持的。陈思和想在复旦开一个关于《兄弟》的会，他很喜欢《兄弟》，是支持《兄弟》的。结果陈思和那天很尴尬，他说我们复旦大学中文系里最支持《兄弟》的四个人，郜元宝、严锋、张新颖、刘志荣都不在，批评你的王宏图在。所以也没办成一个支持《兄弟》的研讨会。…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[本教程解释了 Python 中变量的概念、它们的类型，以及如何在实际项目中使用的示例。


在 Python 中，变量是存储值的保留内存位置。

它们是个名称，可以分配一个值给它并在整个代码中引用它。使用变量使值可访问并为值提供与你的代码相关的上下文/含义。

在开始之前，我希望你已经安装了 Python 并设置了一个基本的编辑器。如果没有，请参考我的以下指南：


如何在 Ubuntu/Linux 上安装 Python 3.11

如何在 Windows 上安装 Python

如何为 Python 设置 IDLE 编辑器


变量规则


变量区分大小写。

变量名称只能包含大写和小写字母（A–Z、a–z）、数字（0–9）和下划线（_）。

它们不能以数字开头。

Python 变量是 动态类型。

Python 支持 Unicode 变量（例如 é 和 ü 等装饰字母，甚至中文、日文和阿拉伯符号）。

根据 PEP 8 标准，变量名只能是小写，单词可以用下划线分隔（例如 total_price）。


Python 变量：示例

要在 Python 中创建一个变量，我们需要使用赋值运算符（=）为其赋值。例如，下面的代码行创建了一个名为 x 的变量并为其赋值 10：

x = 10


在 Python 中，变量是动态类型的，这意味着解释器可以根据分配给它的值来确定变量的数据类型。Python 支持各种类型的变量，包括整数、浮点数、字符串、布尔值和复数。

# 整型变量
age = 20

# 浮点变量
price = 4.99

# 字符串变量
name = "John Doe"

# 布尔变量
is_active = True

# 复数变量
z = 2 + 3j


变量在编程中很有用，…]]></summary>

        <id>https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35331233</id>
        <link href="https://github.com/tech-branch/tsr"/>
        <updated>2023-03-27T19:34:08.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi HN!
I was feeling incredibly frustrated with my struggles in context-switching and writing documentation, so I decided to take action and find a solution.
I wrote a simple tool for Alfred and Raycast that helps me be more mindful when switching between tasks, which can even prevent some of those switches. Plus, I can jot down quick notes on each task as I go, making it easier to document everything once I’m finished.
This tool is really simple with only 5 commands - tsr, tsn, tsl, tsv, tse
tsr writes a new record
tsn writes a new note
tsl shows you the current task
tsv builds a static html page displaying a single timeline of the tasks and notes
tse opens the directory where records are stored for easy manual editing
TSR stores your data as simple csv files in ~/tsr, making it super easy to integrate with other tools or perform your own custom analysis and visualisation magic. The built-in tsv timeline visualisation is rather simple and doesn’t do any analysis (for now at least).
It depends solely on Python3 and works offline. 
I encourage you to check the python scripts to see how simple they are and potentially adapt them to your own needs.
Let me know what you think!

combinations of those flags make sense in a single call.  It turns out,
though, that the kernel has responded in a surprising way to the

After a 2020 change made that response even more surprising, it seems
likely that this behavior will soon be fixed, resulting in a rare user-visible

比尔·盖茨称人工智能的发明 “与微处理器、个人电脑、互联网和移动电话的创造一样根本”，并在一篇题为 《人工智能时代已经开始》 的文章中预测 “整个行业将围绕它重新定位”。他称，他一生中只见过两次革命性的技术展示，一次是 1980 的图形化用户界面，这导致了后来的 Windows 的诞生；另外一次就是去年兴起的人工智能爆发。在他的要求下，OpenAI 训练的 GPT 仅仅用了几个月就以最高分 5 分通过了 AP 生物测试。


消息来源：盖茨笔记



老王点评：这篇文章中，盖茨还提出很多预测，我认为比一些其他互联网大佬的瞎说要可靠得多。




DoomLinux：一个只用来玩 DOOM 的 Linux

有些 Linux 发行版是主要用于某些用途的，但还有一些只能用于某个用途，如一位爱好者开发的 DoomLinux 就只能运行 1993 年的经典游戏《毁灭战士DOOM》。它通过 BusyBox 加载 Linux 内核和标准实用程序，然后运行 fbDOOM，这是一个专门为在 Linux 帧缓冲器上运行而设计的移植版。整个发行版被放在一个可启动的 ISO 文件中，可以放在任何可启动的驱动器上。

老王点评：无用的乐趣，才是有趣的。




由于人数不足，X.org 推迟董事会选举

有些年份，他们只有 4 名候选人竞选 4 个空缺席位，而另外一些年份，他们几乎没有达到投票者参与的 25% 的法定人数。今年的 X.Org 董事会选举被推迟了两周，希望一些有能力的人提名自己参加选举，并能够承诺在董事会任职。

老王点评：每每看到 X.org 的消息，都给人一种英雄迟暮的感觉。]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[财联社消息，《科创板日报》27日讯，此前在日本、泰国等地现身的阿里巴巴集团创始人马云已返回国内。近日有网友在杭州文一路隧道中目击阿里巴巴集团创始人马云。视频中，马云乘坐一辆考特斯，不时与身边及前面的人交谈。


对此，《科创板日报》记者从相关人士处确认，该车内人士分别为马云、阿里巴巴集团董事会主席兼首席执行官张勇以及阿里集团资深副总裁邵晓锋。


2020年10月，蚂蚁集团上市计划搁浅后，马云就鲜少出现在大众眼前，行踪也成外界关注焦点。


第一财经2月19日引述消息人士报道，马云亚最近现身澳大利亚，探访40多年前在中国相遇的澳洲友人。英国媒体去年11月报道，马云已在日本东京市中心居住近半年，并定期前往美国和以色列。今年1月初，有泰国媒体报道马云现身曼谷观看泰拳赛。随后在1月底，再有香港媒体报道，马云在香港与泰国首富正大集团董事长谢国民，以及谢国民的三子、正大行政总裁谢镕仁会面。


彭博社3月27日引述知情人士报道，马云选择继续留在国外，并称自己已从阿里巴巴退下来，未来将专注于农业技术的研究。知情人士称，马云已向阿里巴巴及蚂蚁集团高层表明不要期望他会回国，并重申即使他不在中国，也会全力支持公司取得成功。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[嗨！这周我一直在写一些 Javascript，和往常一样，当我开始一个新的前端项目时，我面临的问题是：我是否应该使用构建系统？

我想谈谈构建系统对我有什么吸引力，为什么我（通常）仍然不使用它们，以及一些前端 Javascript 库要求你使用构建系统时，为什么我觉得这让我感到沮丧。

我写这篇文章是因为我看到的大多数关于 JS 的文章都假定你正在使用构建系统，而对于像我这样的人来说，编写非常简单的、不需要构建系统的小型 Javascript 项目时，构建系统可能反而添加了很多麻烦。

什么是构建系统？

构建系统的思路是，你有一堆 Javascript 或 Typescript 代码，你想在把它放到你的网站上之前把它翻译成不同的 Javascript 代码。

构建系统可以做很多有用的事情，比如：


（出于效率的考虑）将 100 多个 JS 文件合并成一个大的捆绑文件

将 Typescript 翻译成 Javascript

对 Typescript 进行类型检查

精简化

添加 Polyfills 以支持旧的浏览器

编译 JSX

摇树优化Tree Shaking（删除不使用的 JS 代码以减少文件大小）

构建 CSS（像 tailwind 那样）

可能还有很多其他重要的事情


正因为如此，如果你今天正在构建一个复杂的前端项目，你可能会使用 Webpack、Rollup、Esbuild、Parcel 或 Vite 等构建系统。

很多这些功能对我很有吸引力，我过去使用构建系统也是出于这样一些原因： 例如，Mess With DNS 使用 Esbuild 来翻译 Typescript，并将许多文件合并成一个大文件。

目标：轻松地对旧的小网站进行修改

我做了很多简单的小网站（之一、之二、之三、之四），我对它们的维护精…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[钱锺书《管锥编》第二册第463页对“老子王弼注”第七八章的解读提及了“翻案语”（Paradox）和“冤亲词”（Oxymoron）两个词，钱先生认为，老子《五千言》中“正言若反”作为修辞手法“触处弥望”，即修辞所谓“翻案语”与“冤亲词”。钱先生举例说：“大音希声，大象无形”，“大成若缺，大直若屈”即翻案语；“冤亲词乃和解而无间焉”，“上德不德”即冤亲词。钱先生还举了德国神秘宗某诗人（Daniel von Czepko）的一首小诗“因彼故此”为例来说明翻案语和冤亲词，但他同时指出诗中诸如“黑暗之光”（a deep but dazzling darkness）、“死亡之生”、“苦痛之甘美”等翻案语和冤亲词“不可胜稽”，结果就会是“皆神奇而化臭腐矣”。在《管锥编》第五册第169页上钱先生又对冤亲词的使用作了增订，指出：圣·奥古斯丁赞颂上帝，皆出以“冤亲词”，如云：“至隐而至显”“长动而长止”“赫怒而宁静”“言说而缄默”；又自省云：“人居世间，乃死亡之生欤？抑生存之死欤？”钱先生把Paradox译为“翻案语”、Oxymoron译为“冤亲词”，实在是精妙至极！值得外语学习者和翻译工作者学习和借鉴。

《管锥编》，三联书店2019年10月版

Paradox和Oxymoron是英语中两种常见的修辞格，我们在英语学习、文学欣赏和文学翻译中经常会碰到它们。一般认为，诗歌与文章中使用Paradox和Oxymoron是为了增强语言的表现力，既给人以耳目一新之感，也可产生幽默或反讽的效果。关于这两个词的中译，译名有很多。Paradox通常被译为：悖论、反论、诡论、矛盾语、逆说等等；Oxymoron则通常被译为：矛盾修饰法、似非而是的隽语、逆喻等等。这些译名都不如钱译“翻案语”和“冤亲词”来得巧妙。陆谷孙先生在纪念钱先生的文章《灵光隳矣！》的结尾处写道：“钱先生在《管锥编》内的西文雅言翻译，可以作为…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[《幸福地理学》，商务印书馆2023年3月即将出版

“幸福全然有赖于我们与他人的关联：家人、朋友和街坊，以及你不大会注意到的、那个打扫你办公室的清洁妇。幸福不是名词，不是动词，而是一个连词。”乍一听很像是寻常的鸡汤语录，但是，如果你追随埃里克·韦纳（Eric Weiner）一年内在十个国家探寻有关幸福的“科学”答案，在一连串的茫无头绪、若有所悟和自相矛盾之后，这句话似乎也不是全无意义。一本回答“世界上哪里最幸福”的书，探寻的并非“幸福是什么”，而是“哪里最幸福”——确切地说，是关于“世界上哪个国家最幸福”。如果草草翻阅，这本书可能会被某些读者归类为自助励志书。甚至作者自己也说，这是一本“哲思性幽默旅行书”，他宁愿自己被视为一个有思想深度的作家，而不是到处乱跑的记者。怪不得很多评论者都把此书归纳为“旅行与心灵省思的混合物”。
在作者的个人网页上，他这样解释为什么要写此书：“我给美国国家公共电台（NPR）当驻外记者很多年，工作使我前往世界上那些最不幸福的国家，在这些国家寻找那些最不幸福的人，和他们一起度过一些时光。当然总有收获，但也压抑得很。于是，有一天忽然想：如果我去的是那些最幸福的地方呢？那些地方的人到底有什么秘诀能造就幸福呢？本书的念头就是这样率尔登场的。”
埃里克·韦纳从马里兰大学毕业后一直从事新闻工作，1989年至1991年为《纽约时报》做商务报道，之后长期担任美国国家公共电台的驻外记者，先后常驻印度、以色列和日本，其间到三十多个国家采访和报道，多次获得各类新闻奖项。在做了近二十年的记者之后，他开始了向作家的转型。当然，记者生涯所积累的经验、见识与人脉非常有利于他为一个确定的主题准备素材。他选定的第一个主题就是研究“幸福地理学”（所以本书的英文名是The Geography of Bliss）。研究幸福，按幸福程度给世界各国排序，这个学科还真的存在，尽管有人称之为“庸…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[GNOME 用户，你在等待这一刻吗？准备好选择你的颜色吧！




从 Ubuntu 22.04 LTS 开始，Ubuntu 上就有了对强调色的支持，人们都很喜欢它。然而，遗憾的是，GNOME 从来没有这样的支持。

现在，得益于一项在 GNOME 中引入强调色支持的工作，这种情况正在改变。

具体情况如何？ 最近，Alexander Mikhaylenko 发出了一个附有 合并请求 的提议，以在 GNOME 中添加对强调色的支持。

在目前，它还处于一个 早期开发中状态，尚有很多工作要做，还有一些问题要在最终发布前解决。

通过查看其代码，很明显，最初将提供对 10 种强调色的支持，发布后可能会有更多的选择。

想知道它可能看起来如何？

在 Mastodon 上的一个 讨论 中，GNOME 基金会的成员 Jamie 分享了一些由 Alexander 制作的模拟图，其中描绘了两种不同的配色。

一个是绿色的：



另一个是蓝色的：



我必须说，这些看起来不错 😃。想在非 Fedora 发行版上得到一些 Fedora 的爱吗？把它变成蓝色和其他东西？就它了！


📝 请记住，你在上面看到的东西在最终发布前可能会有变化。


预期时间？ 在上述讨论中被另一个用户问到时，Alexander 提到，我们可以 预期强调色支持会在 GNOME 45 中出现。

鉴于 GNOME 44 最近才发布，我们还需要等待一段时间才能真正看到它的实现。

但是，很高兴知道它有可能在不久之后出现。

我很喜欢 GNOME 终于得到了对强调色的支持，我希望这种等待是值得的。

如果你问我，我喜欢在我的 GNOME 系统上有绿色的强调色。你呢？

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[What do you think it's essential math a programmer should know?
I've learned higher algebra, calculus, some geometry which was eased by the already known algebra, number theory, probabilities, combinatorics, graph theory, statistics, formal language and automata theory, and that's mostly it. Most of my CS courses in university required some kind of math which we previously did.
I can't say I remember all I've learned but I can recall things if needed.
It was a thing that programming languages were explained in terms of formal language theory, plus some algebraic constructs. Now a days whenever I read about a programing language, I read about mostly category theory or functional theory and it mostly doesn't make sense.
So how hard or how many math domains should one learn to be able to understand all major CS theory?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Another way to word the question would be: "Could another filesystem be developed that is compatible with ZFS's on-disk layout?"
 Which part of OpenZFS is CDDL-licenced - just the source code, or is it the entire "idea" of ZFS? I'm guessing that the "idea" is more of a copyright thing, in which case you couldn't reuse that idea in another piece of software without copyright infringement. Probably answering my own question here, but I'm wondering what are your thoughts?
 EDIT: To be more clear, I don't intend to actually reimplement OpenZFS. I was more wondering about the legality of it (sounds like it's legal if using a clean room approach), and also why it hasn't already been done (sounds like a combination of "too much effort", "better alternatives exist (btrfs)", and "the license isn't the only incompatible part of OpenZFS")
 Thanks for all the info everyone!

 Since 8080, 9090, etc. are commonly used to serve webservices, and I had no other Docker service running, I was curious what's running, opened up a browser... http://IP:9090 and I was greeted with a beautiful Fedora UI.

谷歌 Project Zero 的安全研究员发现，对 Linux 稳定树所做的内核修复并没有向后移植到许多企业版的 Linux。事实证明，有几个在 Linux 5.15 内核中修复的漏洞，没有在采用 Linux 5.14 内核的较早版本的 CentOS Stream/RHEL 中进行修复，而这些版本还在红帽的支持期中。红帽接受了 Project Zero 报告的安全漏洞，并分配了 CVE 编号，但并没有在 90 天内完成向后移植修复。Project Zero 称会对向后移植安全补丁要求更严格的时限。

互联网档案馆败诉，不能扫描和出借电子书

在四家图书出版商对互联网档案馆提起的诉讼中，一名联邦法官对互联网档案馆作出了不利的裁决，裁定该网站无权扫描图书并像图书馆一样将其借出。法官拒绝了 “合理使用” 的论据，该论据之前曾保护过谷歌图书和数字图书保存项目。法官认为，谷歌图书的使用被认为具有 “改造性”，因为它创建了一个可搜索的数据库，而不是简单地在互联网上发布书籍的副本。而互联网档案馆的“复制和未经授权的借阅没有任何变革性”，复制这些书籍并没有提供 “批评、评论或关于它们的信息”。

当然，作为 高级 Linux 发行版之一，大多数新用户对它并不熟悉。

如果你不知道 为什么你应该使用 NixOS，并且出于好奇而尝试它，那么在继续进行之前，知道它是为谁准备的至关重要。

虽然我假设你已经安装了这个发行版，但如果你是第一次使用，我建议先 在虚拟机上安装 NixOS。

1、更新软件包

即使你使用最新的 ISO 进行安装，也总是会有更新的。那么为什么不从更新软件包开始呢？

要升级软件包，首先，你必须在添加的频道中检查是否有更新：

nix-channel --update


然后，使用下面的命令来安装这些更新（如果有的话）：

sudo nixos-rebuild switch --upgrade


这就行了！它将处理其余的事情。

2、在 NixOS 中改变主机名

如果你尝试用传统的方法 改变主机名（使用 hostnamectl 命令），会出现以下错误：



在 NixOS 中，你可以用它的主配置文件轻松地改变主机名。使用如下命令：

sudo nano /etc/nixos/configuration.nix


在这个配置文件中，寻找以下一行：

networking.hostName = "nixos"；


然后把它改成：

networking.hostName = "Your_Hostname"；


例如，我把我的主机名改为 itsFOSS：

networking.hostName = "itsFOSS"；




现在，保存更改并退出 nano 文本编辑器。

为了使你对主机名的修改生效，执行以下命令：

sudo nixos-rebuild switch


最后，重新打开终端，主机…]]></summary>

Google Play Protect是谷歌为安卓手机提供的恶意软件防护服务，可以扫描安卓手机上的所有应用，并阻止恶意应用安装。


据报道，位于莫斯科的卡巴斯基实验室（Kaspersky Lab）在拼多多的多个版本软件上找到了可能是恶意软件的痕迹。实验室向外界列举出了拼多多软件如何通过自己的特权削弱用户的隐私权和数据安全的诸多细节。


卡巴斯基对媒体回应称：已经从安全研究员 Igor Golovin 那里得到了评论，拼多多APP的部分版本包含恶意代码，利用已知的Android漏洞提权，下载并执行额外的恶意模块，其中一些还获得了访问用户通知和文件的权限。 我们的产品将这些版本检测为 HEUR:Backdoor.AndroidOS.Pinduo.a 。 该应用程序的受感染版本是通过一个本地应用程序商店分发的。


卡巴斯基同时表示，作为背景信息，我们没有发现这个恶意版本，我们只是检测到它。换言之，含恶意代码的版本不是卡巴斯基第一个发现的。但是在该版本中卡巴斯基确实监测出了恶意代码。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[u/Darkhentaint recently posted looking for a "lost gaming distro" from a 2006 Linux Magazine coverdisc: https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/11z1u8u/looking_for_a_lost_distroany_chance_someone_can/
 The disc was easily found on Internet Archive, which explained the story - A Spanish local government wanted to switch to Linux but couldn't find a distro which did everything they wanted, so they made their own distro. For fun, the creators also released a "gaming edition" too.
 There is also a PDF of the DVD inlay from Linux Magazine's website: https://web.archive.org/web/20061101000000*/https://www.linux-magazine.com/issue/64/Linux_Magazine_DVD_Inlay.pdf
 I was interested in this, so I ran it up in KVM and made a little screenshot tour: https://fosstodon.org/@suprjami/110087525461720186
 It's Debian 3 Sarge with kernel 2.6.8 and GNOME 2.8.1. "Gaming edition" just means they pre-install literally every game that Debian provides. It also seems to install the fglrx package for ATI video drivers, and the nVidia driver.
 There are many funny things to be seen. Multiple inconsistent menu systems, each with different icons and contents. 2006 was not Year Of The Linux Desktop.
 The "network" setup asks for your ISP phone number, the idea of providing Ethernet GUI setup hadn't yet occurred to anyone, probably because nobody would have had Ethernet at home in 2006.
 There are old versions of many familiar and outdated games and other things. It still has hits like Wesnoth and LinCity which exist today.
 Of interest to me were old DOSBox 0.63, ZSNES 1.36, and ScummVM 0.6b.
 You can even still visit Google in the ancient Firefox 1.0.6 too!
 I hope you enjoy this trip down memory lane as much as I did.

在2022年出版的《古笔》中，苏州学者王学雷先生梳理了大量史料和考古成果，以呈现宋代以前毛笔的形态和发展，并由此探讨早期书法背后，毛笔这一书写工具所发挥的重要作用。在接受《上海书评》专访时，他进一步延展了书中所涉及的话题，并对汉唐书法传统提出了独到的见解。

《古笔》，中华书局2022年1月出版

《古笔》里涉及的话题非常有意思：汉唐时期的古人所用的毛笔究竟什么样？然而，这个话题似乎一直乏人关注，相关的研究也比较欠缺，您是怎么想到要来“烧”这么一口“冷灶”的呢？
王学雷：“一直乏人关注”倒不完全是，只是我“特别关注”了一下，在“相关的研究也比较欠缺”的背景下，尽我所能地“弥补”而已。在我看来，尽管中国古代不乏“铅笔”“竹笔”“木笔”之类的制作，但在东亚地区悠久的书写传统中，毛笔扮演了最为重要的角色，并且形成了一套非常成熟完善的制作技术体系。在通常情况下，毛笔要与纸、墨、砚配合起来使用，构成所谓的“文房四宝”。而在实际的书写实践中，毛笔的作用是首要的。因而我们研究中国书法，关注的首先是“文房四宝”中的毛笔。只是，一方面，由于时代的变化，今天的人们对毛笔的了解已然日渐生疏，另一方面，中国传统思想观念中一直存在着一种“重道轻器”的风气，“形而上者谓之道，形而下者谓之器”，将“道”与“器”分出了高下优劣。即便到了今天，也有不少书法研究者爱谈“书法之道”或“笔墨”与某种“文化”的“关系”这样的宏大议题。可见他们对基础性的研究并不重视，这样，即便不是一说便错，也会使得所阐发的“大义”缺乏根基，虚无缥缈。我想，对毛笔这个传统书写中的首要工具，应该抓紧研究，而目前存在的研究不足和错误之处，也应该加以纠正。
说到资料，二十年前，我曾经在一家文博单位从事考古工作。每当野外工作结束之后，就要整理发掘出来的材料，我负责的一项重要工作就是逐一登记材料——绘制器物图，以及填写器物记…]]></summary>

对于 Debian 初学者来说，安装 Debian 可能会是一次艰难的经历。官方的下载页面包含了不少链接，以至于到底需要下载哪个令人困惑。

我准备这篇指南来帮助你从下载页面挑选合适的 Debian ISO 文件。

总的来说，你可以将 Debian ISO 文件分为两大类。它们是 “自由” 和 “非自由” 。

关于 “自由” 和 “非自由” Debian 镜像之间的一些注意事项


Debian “非自由” 镜像是指包含不符合 Debian 自由软件准则的软件包的 Debian 操作系统的安装镜像。

“非自由” 软件包包含专有的、有版权的或受许可证限制的软件，这些软件包禁止用户修改或分发代码。Debian 项目提供这些 “非自由” 镜像作为用户的一种可选下载项，以便他们使用需要专有驱动或固件的特定硬件设备或软件。

“自由” 版本的 Debian，仅包含开源和可自由分发的软件包，这意味着用户有修改、分发和与他人分享的自由，而不受任何法律和道德上的限制。


从 Debian 12 “Bookworm”（即将发布）之后，非自由固件软件包将正式包含在主 ISO 文件中。因此，这篇指南将分为两个部分。

下载: Debian 12 “Bookworm”

这里是一份下载 ISO 版本的 Debian 12 “Bookworm” 的简单的表格（当前还不稳定，正在测试）。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[3月25日，据《华尔街日报》报道，Twitter表示，将从4月1日开始取消那些在马斯克接管该平台之前验证过帐户的用户的传统的免费的蓝V认证标记。Twitter表示，已有传统蓝V认证标记的用户可以付费订阅Twitter Blue服务。


自去年11月以来，传统的蓝V认证标记与通过Twitter Blue验证的账户在该平台上共存，Twitter Blue是马斯克宣传的一项订阅服务。任何用户只需每月支付7美元，就可以通过Twitter Blue获得验证，取得蓝V标记和其他福利。


蓝V认证徽章之前只为政治人物、名人、记者和其他公共人物预留，但在推出订阅服务后，任何人都可以付费获得。马斯克希望借此为Twitter增加收入，以弥补广告收入的流失。


马斯克去年12月初表示，基础的Twitter Blue会员看到的广告只有非会员的一半，该公司明年还将推出更高级别的无广告会员。

大众汽车将支持汽车软件产品长达十余年

汽车的预期使用寿命要比智能手机长得多，而现在汽车上的信息娱乐系统对汽车的运行是不可或缺的。大众集团软件部门称“终身支持是完全重要的”，如果要给这个“终身”一个期限，那么是在生产结束后，软件支持 10 年，硬件为 15 年。而且，对于那些希望更长时间的品牌，如布加迪、兰博基尼和保时捷等，将提供额外的持续支持。此外，网络安全以及安全更新和补丁只要有就会提供。

老王点评：确实，手机可以经常换，汽车更换的频率就低多了，那到时候车载软件的更新就是个问题。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[在这篇文章中，我将通过一些通俗易懂的例子来解释 Python 的 input() 函数的基础知识。




Python 是世界上最流行的编程语言之一，广泛应用于各种应用程序中。Python 中的一个基本概念是 input() 函数，它允许用户通过提供输入值与程序进行交互。

让我们看看 input() 函数是如何工作的，以及如何在 Python 程序中有效地使用它。

在开始之前，我希望你已经安装了 Python 并设置了一个基本的编辑器。如果没有，请参考我的以下指南：


如何在 Ubuntu 等 Linux 上安装 Python 3.11

如何在 Windows 上安装 Python

如何为 Python 设置 IDLE 编辑器


Python Input 函数

Python 中的 input() 函数用于接受用户输入的字符串。它提示用户输入一个值并等待用户提供输入。然后将用户的输入作为字符串存储在变量中，稍后可以在程序中使用。

句法

input("your message to user")


当你运行 input() 函数时，它会向用户显示消息并 等待 输入。显示光标等待。当用户输入并按下回车键，input() 函数就会读取用户的输入。该值存储在你指定的变量中。

让我们看几个例子。

示例 1：简单的 input() 函数用法

以下代码片段接受输入并显示带有附加字符串的输出：

your_name = input("Enter your name:")
print("Hello " + your_name)


输出：

Enter your name:arindamHello arindam




示例 2：以整数和浮点数作为输入

在使用 input() 函数时，你还可以在运行时使用 int() 或 float() 将输入转换。这是一个例子：

no_of_books = int(input("Enter total books ordered:"))
print ("Total number of books:", no_of_books)

price_of_each_book = float(input("Enter unit price:"))
print ("Total price:", no_of_books * price_of_each_book)


输出：

Enter total books ordered:5
Total number of books: 5
Enter unit price:10.1
Total price: 50.5


示例 3：连接列表

你还可以使用其他函数（例如列表）来接受一组值并将它们转换为 Python 中的 列表。这是一个接受输入并将其转换为列表的示例。然后使用另一组值并附加到第一个列表：

# 获取第一个列表的输入
list_1 = list(input("Enter numbers for list 1:"))

# 获取第二个列表的输入
list_2 = list(input("Enter some letters for list 2:"))

# 循环遍历第二个列表并添加到第一个列表
for j in list_2:
    list_1.append(j)

# 打印修改后的第一个列表
print(list_1)


输出：

Enter numbers for list 1:1234
Enter some letters for list 2:ABCD
['1', '2', '3', '4', 'A', 'B', 'C', 'D']


总结

我希望这个简单的指南通过几个示例阐明了 input() 函数。对于简单的场景，它是一个强大的功能，可以从标准输入中接受值。

清光绪二十九年（1903），新政启动后第三年，清亡前八年，文华殿大学士、领衔军机大臣荣禄在京病逝，清廷追谥“文忠”。时人评论“综光绪一朝，荣文忠公实为此中枢纽，文忠没而国运亦沦夷”（陈夔龙《梦蕉亭杂记》）。对于这样一位权尊势重、影响国运匪浅，生前已然谣谤缠身，身后又难盖棺论定的晚清重臣，坊间流传“形象”言人人殊，学术界也一直缺乏有深度的专门研究。如果说，数年前马忠文先生撰著《荣禄与晚清政局》（社会科学文献出版社2016年）一书，改变了“长期以来除了简略的官修传记和几篇碑传文，没有一部有关荣禄的完整而具有较高学术水准的传记或专著”的现状（金冲及语），那么新近出版的王刚编著《荣禄年谱长编》，应为荣禄资料蒐集、整理与研究领域的又一大学术创获，或当得起为本书作“序”的尚小明教授所赠“引征详赡”“考订扎实”“评判允洽”诸判语。
年谱由纪传和编年二体史书演变而来，按梁启超的说法，也是“人的专史”之一种。他在总结清人“传记及谱牒学”成就时，尝申论“后人补作或改作昔贤年谱”之难，不仅在于作者之去谱主“近则百数十年，远乃动逾千岁”的客观条件，更在于谱主材料“蒐集”与“裁断”之于作者的考验——
是故欲为一名人作一佳谱，必对于其人著作之全部，贯穴钩稽，尽得其精神与其脉络。不宁惟是，凡与其人有关系之人之著作中直接语及其人者，悉当留意。不宁惟是，其时之朝政及社会状况，无一可以忽视。故用一二万言之谱，往往须翻书至百数十种。其主要之书，往往须翻至数十遍。资料既集，又当视其裁断之识与驾驭之技术何如，盖兹事若斯之难也。（《中国近三百年学术史·清代学者整理旧学之总成绩（三）》）
荣禄一生不以文字见长，且为人深沉，不擅动笔墨，出自本人之手的文献资料原就有限（包括记叙其家世的少量传记资料；职务相关的官方文书如奏折【片】…]]></summary>

        <id>https://linux.cn/article-15659-1.html?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss</id>
        <link href="https://linux.cn/article-15659-1.html?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss"/>
        <updated>2023-03-25T02:07:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[GNOME 44 终于来了，它带来了重新打造的设置应用，更新了快速设置功能，改进了可访问性等等。




GNOME 可以说是*最受欢迎的桌面环境之一。

之前的 GNOME 43 版本 就补充了许多有用的功能，而现在的 GNOME 44 版本也是一样。

让我们看看都有哪些内容。

🆕 GNOME 44 有什么新功能？


 

我们最近已经分别介绍了 GNOME 44 的最佳功能；在这里，让我回顾一下这个发布的相关细节。

主要的亮点包括：


设置菜单的改造

快速设置的改进

文件选择器的网格视图

文件管理器的改进


1、设置菜单的改造



设置菜单进行了小规模的改造，可访问性面板被重新设计，以提供一个更现代的导航体验。



然后，一项新的功能让你可以 通过二维码分享 Wi-Fi 密码，并且改进了鼠标/触摸板设置。

“设备安全”下的信息也得到了更新，以增加技术细节的清晰度。



2、改进的快速设置菜单



快速设置面板已经得到了许多更新；它现在可以让你 查看和管理当前连接的蓝牙设备。

但你必须前往设置菜单来配对新设备。



另一个新增功能是新的屏幕截图快捷方式，可以毫不费力地从快速设置菜单中进行屏幕截图。

这还不是全部；GNOME 44 的快速设置菜单现在有一个检查在后台运行的应用程序的巧妙方法。



你可以在我们之前的报道中找到关于这个功能的更多细节：


GNOME 正在（某种程度上）恢复在几年前删除的功能


3、新的锁屏/登录窗口



GNOME 44 提供了更新的锁屏和登录窗口，有一个更大的用户头像和各种元素的细微变化，例如时钟的字体大小。

4、GNOME 文件选取器中的缩略图



去年年底，我们看到了 GNOME 文件选取器的一个长时间要求的功能 的 回归，而现在它终于到来了。

GNOME 的文件选取器从来没有一个合适的缩略图预览来查看文件。取而代之的是，它依赖于一个普通的列表视图。

直到现在。

它现在带来了一个合适的缩略图视图，可以通过点击文件选取器右上角的 “列表-网格视图” 切换进行切换。

🛠️ 其他变化和改进



这些并不是 GNOME 44 带来的唯一改进；这里有一些值得一提的改进：


新壁纸。

对文件管理器的各种小更新带来了性能的提高。

Epiphany 网页浏览器被移植到 GTK4，并进行了许多错误修正。

在 GNOME 软件应用中加入了一个新的过滤器，激活后只显示开源的应用程序。

对联系人应用进行了各种改进，能够以二维码的形式分享联系人。

对 GNOME Builder 的许多 UI 和风格进行了修复。

在 GNOME Circle 集合中添加了十个新的应用程序。


你可以通过 官方发布说明 来了解更多。

开始使用 GNOME 44

你可以在下个月期待 GNOME 44 与 Ubuntu 23.04 和 Fedora 38 一起出现。

如果你迫不及待地想得到它，使用 Boxes 安装 GNOME OS 应该是一个测试它的好方法。


GNOME


💬 你对这个丰富的 GNOME 44 更新有何看法？你想在你的 Linux 系统上使用它吗？

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey guys!
 It's now been roughly one year since my initial post about LAPAS, our LanPartyServer setup.
 The originally published version of LAPAS was just a Markdown document with instructions for how to set up LAPAS. Due to the complexity of the entire setup, however, reproducibility was admittedly rather limited and involved a lot of effort and domain knowledge. Since our own instance was already getting on in years and the base was starting to cause problems here and there, I had to reinstall it anyway. So I took this opportunity to directly create a small installation script able to replicate this new installation, which is now based on Debian 11. I know, calling it a "distribution" probably is a bit of a stretch, since it's only an installer script, but I think it's a lot closer to on…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I’m a MacBook fan, but I’m also a tinkerer. In the past, I used to root iPhones, flash a million android ROMs on countless devices, tried Ubuntu for a while…but the last several years, I’ve just settled into the Apple world.
 I got the itch again and tried putting Linux on my older 12” MacBook (Fedora, Nobara, and Ubuntu). It mostly worked, but between janky audio drivers and complete lack of suspend support, I’ve given up on that hardware.
 I want to get a laptop to try using Linux as my main OS for a while, but all I know are Macs. And I’m absolutely addicted to the responsiveness, gesture support, & huge size of the trackpad. I use gestures a ton, they’re second nature to me. While some were supported in Gnome, it all felt…well…bad. Mainly, less responsive & the pointer would over or undershoot a lot. So, I’m wondering if there’s non-Apple hardware out there that Linux drivers & kernels support exceptionally well and whose hardware is as high quality as Apple’s.
 Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Matthew Garrett looks at
the recent disclosure of GitHub's private host key, how it probably
came about, and what a better approach to key management might look like.


	The main problem is that client tooling just doesn't handle this
	well. OpenSSH has no way to do TOFU for CAs, just the keys
	themselves. This means there's no way to do a git clone
	ssh://git@github.com/whatever and get a prompt asking you
	to trust Github's CA. Instead, you need to add a @cert-authority
	github.com (key) line to your known_hosts file by hand, and since
	approximately nobody's going to do that there's only marginal
	benefit in going to the effort to implement this
	infrastructure. The most important thing we can do to improve the
	security of the SSH ecosystem is to make it easier to use
	certificates, and that means improving the behaviour of the
	clients.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I tried reading the Nix documentation, and honestly a lot of it went over my head. (Not the user manual; the technical stuff). I was hoping someone could explain how it works in simpler terms.
 This is what I've got so far: 
  
Purely functional package managers treat all packages as immutable values
 
A lot of people claim this eliminates dependency hell
 
All of this has something to do with cryptographic hashes encoding information all of a specific package's dependencies
 
 I assume I'm just completely missing something here, but how exactly is this different from the Gentoo system of slotting different package versions into the same system, and then saving the system state in a world file? I mean aside from the fact that Nix keeps a record of all previous states (in which case, how is it different from Gentoo + world file logs? Or Gentoo, but with snapshotting?)
 I've seen suggestions that, whereas most Linux distributions check the behavior of packages to see if something breaks, this never happens with Nix. I think that's the part I'm most unclear on: how does that work? And why would you need a purely functional package manager to implement something like that?
 And assuming all of that is true, given that a companies like Red Hat and SUSE shell out oodles money to an upstream distribution principally to make sure their software is stable and doesn't break, how have they not shifted their entire infrastructure to using Nix yet?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've been dual booting Linux and Windows for the past few months, and exclusively using Linux (Fedora) for the past few weeks. Fedora (Ubuntu and other distros before that) has been great, but not without issues. After Firefox glitched for the fifth time today, I logged into Windows for the first time in weeks.
 Firefox not ever glitching feels nice. The window management feels nice. Using some of my favorite apps like ShareX, FileOptimizer, PortableApps.com, Paint.NET, and Office (sorry) feels nice. The precision touchpad drivers are far better. Fractional scaling is a non-issue. Dolby Audio sounds amazing.
 I've been using Linux on and off for over a decade, mostly off, and I'd be lying if I didn't admit to waiting for Linux being the perfect utopia one day. It's been getting better every day, but it's still not quite there. It's not about the distribution or the desktop environment or the hardware - there's one or another issue with all of them.
 I remind myself that perfection doesn't exist, of the problems in Windows that pushed me towards Linux in the first place. Windows 11 with its burgeoning bloat, tracking, memory use, always placing some random icon on the taskbar, and trick-begging me into using Edge at least once a quarter. In comparison, Fedora with GNOME is lean, fast, and doesn't play mind games with me.
 Fedora is my default boot option, and I will be back on it soon, but for now I'll relish that Dolby Audio while snipping some quick screenshots on ShareX.

老王点评：每一个进步都如预料般出现，但是 AI “寒武纪”之后是什么，我想象不到。




兆芯开始向内核递交补丁加入对永丰架构的支持

台湾威盛（VIA）在中国的合资企业兆芯开始向内核递交补丁加入对永丰微架构的支持。兆芯去年宣布了采用永丰架构的服务器 x86_64 处理器 KH-4000 系列。永丰是陆家嘴微架构的继任者，仍然采用 16nm 工艺，支持最高 32 个核心，相比陆家嘴的 8 核是一大飞跃，频率最高 2.2GHz，支持 PCIe 3.0 和 DDR4。虽然它比不上 AMD 和英特尔的最新处理器，但对于国产 CPU 而言是进步。

老王点评：国产架构开始纷纷加入 Linux 支持，这是好事。




美国作家协会将允许人工智能参与剧本创作

该提案将允许作家使用人工智能来帮助写剧本，而不必分享写作信用或分割残值。或者，可以将人工智能生成的剧本交给作家，让他改写或润色，而作家仍将被视为第一作者。事实上，该提案将把人工智能视为一种铅笔一样的工具。目前还不清楚代表电影公司的 AMPTP 是否会接受这一想法。


消息来源：Variety



老王点评：确实，以后 AI 就像是一种铅笔或办公软件一样。]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[什么是代理？

代理是充当客户端和另一台服务器之间的中介的服务器或软件应用。它充当客户端和互联网之间的网关，允许用户访问在线资源，同时隐藏他们的身份、位置和其他个人信息。

代理通常用于增强安全性和隐私，并为你的网络添加过滤器/防火墙。

有几种类型的代理，如 HTTP 代理、SOCKS 代理、透明代理等。

除非你在透明代理后面，否则检查起来毫不费力。在这里，我将讨论检测透明代理和常用代理的方法。

如何检查你是否在透明代理后面

虽然每种类型的代理都有其特性和功能，但如果它是透明代理，你将无法在客户端的 PC 上检测到它。这是因为透明代理在后台静默运行，拦截所有流量而不修改它。

有时，可能是你的互联网服务提供商和内容交付网络使用它们来缓存资源的副本以节省带宽或只是为了监视/过滤网络。

有几种方法可以检查你是否在透明代理后面：


通过某些在线 IP 检测/检查网站获得的 IP 地址可能与你的计算机或设备的 IP 地址不匹配。因为代理服务器正在拦截你的流量并将其与 IP 地址一起发送出去。

检查你的网络设置以查看是否配置了代理服务器。

借助一些在线代理检测工具。

连接到你知道不存在的服务器。 如果网页上显示的错误看起来与平时不同，你可能使用了代理。


无论你喜欢与否，你始终可以使用 VPN 服务 绕过透明代理。

如何检查你是否在 Ubuntu 上使用代理

Ubuntu 或任何其他 Linux 发行版提供了多种检查方法。此处使用运行 GNOME 的 Ubuntu 22.10。

使用 GNOME 设置

这是直接的 GUI 方式。打开 GNOME 设置Settings 并转到 “网络Networks” 选项卡，然后按旁边的齿轮图标。



它应该默认 禁用Disabled。

如果你在代理后面，你可以在这里看到不同的状态。在代理设置中，你可以看到，我在这里使用了代理（手动配置）。



可以使用 GNOME 桌面中的 gsettings 命令更改相同的代理状态。

gsettings set org.gnome.system.proxy mode 'none'


你可以将 none 替换为 auto 或 manual。请记住，此设置是临时的，仅适用于当前用户。

使用命令行

你可以通过命令行以多种方式获取代理的状态。

通过列出关联的环境变量获取代理的状态

打开终端并运行以下任一命令：

env | grep -i proxy


cat /etc/environment | grep -i proxy


set | grep -i proxy




空输出意味着没有配置代理。否则，它将打印相关的环境变量。


🚧 请注意，如果你将代理设置为环境变量，这将起作用。


或者，你可以回显每个代理变量以检查是否设置了特定的代理变量。

以下是你可以在终端中输入的内容：

echo $http_proxy


使用 nmcli 命令检查

打开终端并输入：

nmcli connection show




这将列出你的连接和关联的 UUID 编号。记下要检查的连接的 UUID 编号。然后使用命令：

nmcli connection show <UUID or name> | grep -i "proxy"


这将列出变量，你可以在其中记下代理服务器和端口。



总结

我希望本指南可以帮助你了解你是否在使用代理。

我必须提一下，并非所有代理配置都是恶意的。

但是，了解你的系统是否配置了代理很重要。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[CrowPi 是一个超棒的树莓派项目系统，安装在一个笔记本电脑般的外壳里。




我喜欢历史，也喜欢计算机，因此相比于计算机如何变成个人配件，我更喜欢听它在成为日常家用电器前的故事。我经常听到的一个故事 是很久以前（反正在计算机时代算久远了）的计算机是多么的简单。事实上，它们简单到对于一个好奇的用户来说，弄清楚如何编程并不是十分困难。再看看现代计算机，它具有面向对象的编程语言、复杂的 GUI 框架、网络 API、容器等，但愈发令人担忧的是，计算工具正变得越来越难懂，对于那些没有接受过专门培训的人来说基本上无法使用。

从树莓派在 2012 年发布之日起，它就一直被定位为一个教育平台。一些第三方供应商通过附加组件和培训套件支持树莓派，以帮助所有年龄段的学习者探索编程、物理计算和开源。然而，直到最近，很大程度上还是要由用户来弄清楚市场上的所有部件如何组合在一起，直到我最近买了 CrowPi。



CrowPi2 介绍

乌鸦是非常聪明的鸟。它们能识别并记住面孔，模仿听到的声音，解决复杂的谜题，甚至使用工具来完成任务。CrowPi 使用乌鸦作为其徽标和名字是恰当的，因为这个设备充满了探索、实验、教育的机会，最重要的是，充满了乐趣。

其设计很巧妙：它看起来像笔记本电脑，但远不止于此。当你从机壳中取出蓝牙键盘时，它会显示一个隐藏的电子设备工坊，配有 LCD 屏幕、16 个按钮、刻度盘、RFID 传感器、接近传感器、线路板、扬声器、GPIO 连接、LED 阵列等等。而且这一切都是可编程的。

顾名思义，该装置本身完全由树莓派提供支持，它牢固地固定在机壳底部。



默认情况下，你应该用电源适配器为设备充电，包装附带一个壁式插头，你可以将其插入机壳，而不是直接为树莓派供电。你还可以使用插入外部微型 USB 端口的电池电源。机壳内甚至还有一个抽屉，方便你存放电池…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[当地时间3月23日，OpenAI宣布ChatGPT能够支持第三方插件接入，这些插件是专门为“以安全为核心原则的语言模型设计的工具”，可帮助ChatGPT访问最新信息、运行计算或使用第三方服务。


OpenAI将插件称为语言模型的“耳目”。由于ChatGPT的数据库只更新至2021年9月，若用户的问题涉及该时间点之后的事件，它给出的答案常含有错误信息。但是通过接入插件，ChatGPT终于能够接入网络，获取最新的资讯。


目前只有等待名单上的用户和开发人员能够使用测试版插件，OpenAI称优先考虑少数开发者以及ChatGPT Plus的付费用户，未来会更大规模地向更多用户开放。


据官网的介绍，ChatGPT的第一批第三方插件包含11种类型，由Expedia、FiscalNote、Instacart、KAYAK、Klarna、Milo、Open Table、Shopify、Slack、Speak、Wolfram和Zapier建立。


OpenAI通过一段视频，对部分插件进行了详细的介绍——Open Table插件允许用户搜索可预订的餐厅；Wolfram插件能够提高计算能力；Instacart插件允许ChatGPT在本地商店购物；Zapier可与谷歌Gmail等应用程序连接，适用于办公场景。


此外，除了其他公司提供的第三方插件，OpenAI也推出了自己的两款插件——网络浏览器（web browser）和代码解释器（code interpreter）。据介绍，前者允许ChatGPT访问互联网，后者允许ChatGPT使用Python在沙盒环境中处理上传和下载任务，帮助它解决数学问题、进行数据分析和可视化、转换文件格式等。


OpenAI提供的案例显示，向ChatGPT询问奥斯卡获奖信息，它能够回复2023年的最新数据。在此之前，ChatGPT无法跟踪2021年9月以后的信息，澎湃新闻此前在2月进行测试时，曾要求ChatGPT分析谷歌第四季度财报，但它提供了错误的业绩数据。


值得注意的是，OpenAI还开源了知识库检索插件的代码，任何开发者都可以自行托管信息，以增强ChatGPT。


新插件的发布再一次在科技界引起地震。科技媒体Venture Bear评价，此次更新是一个重要的里程碑。聊天机器人能够访问互联网并与之进行交互，意味着它不仅能为用户提供具体的服务，而且还正在创建一个生态系统。开发者可以在其中创建并分享自己的插件，以造福用户。


“类似于苹果的应用商店，它通过允许第三方软件在该平台发展，来改变移动行业。未来ChatGPT的插件功能可能会在AI领域开辟新的可能性和市场。”Venture Bear写道，“OpenAI允许ChatGPT接入插件，表明该公司正在将它从聊天机器人转变为开发者平台，以进一步巩固其主导地位。”


不少科技同行也震惊于OpenAI的创新。Fellow AI的联合创始人在推特上写道，“OpenAI将ChatGPT当作一种平台游戏。”软件公司HashiCorp的创始人表示，“我开发了很多插件系统，而OpenAI的ChatGPT插件可能是我在计算领域见过的最疯狂、最令人印象深刻的一种。”


不过，ChatGPT的联网可能也会带来更多风险。OpenAI承认，联网之后它可能会执行恶意指令，例如发送欺诈性和垃圾邮件、绕过安全限制误导用户或滥用他人信息。不过该公司表示，已经在内部和外部合作者进行了“红队演练（red-teaming exercises）”，实施多项保障措施以防止上述情况发生。


“我们正在努力开发插件并将它们开放给更多受众，”OpenAI说道，“我们还有很多东西要学习，也希望能在大家的帮助下，创造出既实用又安全的技术。”

“从来不朽之笔，须传不朽之人，于是人以文传，文以人传——究竟谁靠谁传，渐渐的不甚了然起来……”
这是鲁迅的名作《阿Q正传》第一章“序”中的话。少年时初读《阿Q正传》，我就把这段精辟的议论铭记于心了，但完全把它当作一种犀利的讽刺。年长以后，每当读一些名人传记或回忆录，总想起这番话来，仔细玩味，觉得这虽然是种调侃之言，但还确实道出了一定的真理。
临近耄耋之年，应上海译文出版社冯涛先生之约译完这部《约翰生传》后，我相信鲁迅的这段话用到这部著作上再贴切不过了。
“词典约翰生”
先说“不朽之人”。约翰生凭一己之力，用八年工夫编著了一部《英语词典》，赢得了“词典约翰生”的徽号。要知道，法兰西学院由四十位院士组成的团队花了四十年光阴才编成了他们的《法语词典》，所以，仅此一项功劳，约翰生完全算得上是一位“不朽之人”了。十九世纪英国名作家托马斯·卡莱尔在他题名为《英雄与英雄崇拜》的演讲录中，把约翰生列为三位“文人英雄”之首（另外两人是卢梭和彭斯）。该书对他的《词典》讲了这样一段话：
假使约翰生除了他的《词典》，再没有留下任何东西，人们也可以从中探寻出一种伟大的才智，一个真正的人。凭借其明确的定义，总体的坚实稳固、诚实可信、真知灼见以及卓有成效的方法，它堪称所有词典中的翘楚。它里面有一种建筑学上的高贵品质；它屹立在那里，俨然是一座宏伟、坚固、方正的广厦，巧夺天工，完整对称：你断定建造它的是一位真正的大工匠。

约翰生编写的《英语词典》

及至十八世纪，法国和意大利早都有了自己语言的权威性词典的时候，英国还没有一部标准的英语词典，随着世代的更替，十八世纪的作家们担心自己的语言很快就会变成老古董，就像蒲柏（Alexander Pope）在《批评论》中所写的那样：
我们的儿子们看见父辈的语言陵替，
乔叟现在是这样，德莱顿也必定如此。

“纪念馆”与“建馆人”兼“讲解员”
关于《约翰生传》，我前面引用过卡莱尔评述约翰生《词典》的话，如果把其中的“词典”改换成“传记”，再把专用于词典的几个词适当改换一下，整个评语完全适用于《约翰生传》。这段议论把《词典》比作一座伟大的建筑。译完《约翰生传》后，我的感觉好像是被鲍斯威尔引领着参观了一座规模宏大、内容丰富、布局完善的现代化的约翰生纪念馆。鲍斯威尔既是建馆人，又是讲解员。跟所有的纪念馆一样，讲解员首先给观众诵读一篇“前言”，涉及建馆的主旨、成因、方法、特点。前言特别指出，人们将会看到的是原原本本的约翰生，不掩过、不饰非、不涂彩、不描金。接下去讲解员就引领我们参观一间间展室，按年月顺序排列，从约翰生出生到约翰生去世，安葬在西敏寺，最后是一段“结束语”。

二十五岁的鲍斯威尔


书商戴维斯的书店，约翰生和鲍斯威尔在此地初次相逢。

在纪念馆里，陈列着约翰生先后出版的作品，鲍斯威尔给出了扼要的点评，同时给出了写作该作品的动机、经过与出版后的反响。如，约翰生之所以写《拉塞拉斯》，目的是用这笔收益操办他母亲的丧事，并偿还她留下的几笔小小的债务。这本书是他在一个星期内的每个晚上写的，一边写，一边把成稿拿去付印，没有通读过。书商给他的酬金是一百镑。
这里还有鲍斯威尔发掘出的大量匿名文章，或替别人代写，或送给他人以人家的名义发表，有他早年的翻译，有他的祈祷文，笔记，有约翰生口授、鲍斯威尔笔录的法律辩护词。
这里有大量的约翰生书信原件或抄件，有约翰生的朋友提供的关于约翰生的言论和活动的文字记录。
如果我把鲍斯威尔写进传记的约翰生对往事的追忆和约翰生的同学和朋友给鲍斯威尔口头提供的轶事比作纪念馆中的图片的话，那么鲍斯威尔记录下来的他亲耳听见和亲眼看见甚至参与其中的场景就是纪念馆中的原声录音和实况录像了。

 I have a use case in which I *need* to be able to handwrite which cannot be substituted by typing. Having this Handwriting digital is also important to be able to erase, copy and move around bits of text / sketches however i like.
 At the moment i am using OneNote on a 2in1 Laptop, but i would like to run this laptop on linux & also am annoyed by the fact that OneNote only offers an infinite canvas, instead of giving blank A4 pages & the ability weave in PDF pages like Apple's GoodNotes does effortlessly (their pen is worse + i dont want to chain myself to their ecosystem).
 I have seen colleagues use linux programs that offer these features but all have the same problem in that they dont have a hotkey to enable the eraser & also dont have a stroke eraser, which would significantly slow me down.
 If you have some experience or ideas i'd appreciate if you shared them with me :)

 I'm designing a general purpose desktop framework, and I like the capabilities model of security, but I'd like to match it with a widely supported standard in linux. The article linked above mentions the POSIX capabilities api, but checking the man page, it doesn't look fit enough to control permissions for, say, the device's camera, or specific directories in the file system.
 I want a system that can be used by user facing apps, with similar security as Android or the Web, where apps ask permissions for specific resources to the user and they have to explicitly allow access to them.
 If not capability based, what's the most widely used API for security in the linux desktop that's close to what I'm describing?

 I remember being so into the Ubuntu project and really feeling that was the future.
 Then slowly lost interest and stuck with what I knew.
 When it comes to Linux these days and all the various distros what are you really excited about and why?
 I remember finding that the passionate explanations of other Linux users really made me want to support these amazing projects even if I was just a total newb in there world lol
 Anyway I'd love to hear what you feel is going on right now in the Linux community and what you are really excited for on the near horizon :)

Helicone's one-line integration logs the prompts, completions, latencies, and costs of your OpenAI requests. It currently works with GPT, and can be integrated with one line of code. There’s a demo at https://www.helicone.ai/video.
Helicone's core technology is a proxy that routes all your OpenAI requests through our edge-deployed Cloudflare Workers. These workers are incredibly reliable and cause no discernible latency impact in production environments. As a proxy, we offer more than just observability: we provide caching and prompt formatting, and we'll soon add user rate limiting and model provider back off to make sure your app is…]]></summary>

 ​
 I would like to share that I have been working for a year on my own distribution based on Arch Linux for gaming and desktop called Hybrid Linux.. I want to let more people know that I am doing this.
 ​
 Let's get into the nitty-gritty of this distribution. This distribution is created primarily for use on the desktop, I do not want to support laptops for several reasons, and one of them is a hybrid graphics with Nvidia, so all the settings are fine-tuned for the desktop.
 It is largely inspired by projects like Pop!_OS, Garuda Linux, Nobara Project, CachyOS.

 Now I'll talk about the software part:
 The kernel:
 Basically it uses patches from the SirLucjan kernel-patches repository. SirLucjan is rebuilding patches from the vanilla kernel upstream and is work…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As a preface, this obviously applies more to desktop Linux than server Linux. 
 With MS and Google putting LLMs in their office solutions, it seems likely that Windows 12 (and likely Macs as well, since Apple has their own LLM) will come with AI fully embedded. I'm envisioning things like pointing it towards multiple spreadsheets and documents and automatically generating a presentation or writing down 5 key insights drawn from a spreadsheet of data. 
 These AI require lots of compute to run and while we will certainly get local models that are pretty good, the state of the art will run on huge cloud servers and scale off of massive amounts of compute. Can open source software compete with multibillion dollar companies with respect to AI? 
 Not trying to be doom and gloom, just wanted to hear some opinions. I swapped to Linux about 18 months ago and I really love it, just a bit worried about what's to come and whether Linux will be less capable in the future compared to AI powered proprietary OSes.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[当地时间3月21日，微软公司创始人比尔·盖茨在其博客文章《人工智能时代已经开启》中表示，自1980年首次看到图形用户界面（graphical user interface）以来，OpenAI的GPT人工智能模型是他所见过的最具革命性的技术进步。比尔·盖茨认为人工智能（AI）可与手机、互联网比肩齐声。


1、盖茨在博文中提到，图形用户界面是每个现代操作系统的先驱，包括Windows系统。Charles Simonyi向盖茨演示了这项技术后，盖茨将其用于Windows操作系统，盖茨表示，这是第一次令其印象深刻的革命性技术演示。


2、盖茨表示，“我知道我刚刚看到了自图形用户界面以来最重要的技术进步，”他还表示，“人工智能的发展与微处理器、个人电脑、互联网和移动电话的诞生同样重要。它将改变人们工作、学习、旅行、获得医疗保健以及沟通交流的方式。整个行业都将围绕它重新定义，企业也将通过如何使用GPT来进行划分。”


在博文中，盖茨再度介绍了他从一名慈善家的视角所看到的人工智能的可能性，例如帮助人们提高生产力、挽救生命、改善教育不平等。


3、对于人工智能可能威胁人类的普遍担忧，盖茨也给出了自己的见解。“任何具有如此颠覆性的新技术都必然会让人感到不安，人工智能更是如此，”盖茨写道，“我明白为什么——它引发了关于劳动力、法律体系、隐私、偏见等一系列尖锐问题。同时人工智能也会犯事实性错误并产生幻觉。”


4、盖茨表示，未来将会产生“超级人工智能”，它可以完成人脑的一切工作，而内存大小和运行速率则将远超人脑。“超级人工智能”可以建立自己的目标，而目标会是什么？与人类利益冲突了怎么办？是否应该阻止“超级人工智能”发展？届时这些问题都将变得更加紧迫。


5、盖茨还预判到，包括AI的进步将使个人代理的创建成为可能，人工智能还将显著加快医学突破的速度等等。

英国著名文化史家和艺术史家迈克尔·巴克森德尔（Michael Baxandall，1933-2008）的《15世纪意大利的绘画与经验》（Painting and Experience in Fifteenth Century Italy ,0xford University Press 1972、1988；王可萌译，北京大学出版社，2023年3 月）是半个世纪前出版的著作，里面所谈到的一些艺术家及作品案例从艺术史的研究视角来看，在今天无疑已经有了许多新的研究成果。但是从研究视角和方法论上来说，这本初衷为论证图像资料是社会史研究的重要例证并具有重要价值的著作，从十五世纪社会经济史、生活史及其视觉经验史的角度所进行的研究、所得出的结论则并未过时，而正是这一方面引起我对该书的很大兴趣。从十五世纪意大利的社会生活语境、当时人们的知识水平以及普遍拥有的视觉经验来论证社会发展如何影响了视觉艺术技法的产生以及创作习惯的变化，论证画作风格乃是社会历史演进的产物，因此艺术创作及图像作为社会史研究史料具有重要意义——这无疑是历史图像学仍然亟须深入展开研究的重要场域。

迈克尔·巴克森德尔（Michael Baxandall，1933—2008）


 《15世纪意大利的绘画与经验》英文版封面

巴克森德尔在2008年去世之前写的该书中文版序言（此据该书“译后记”，查巴克森德尔《意图的模式》1998年中译本附录“巴克森德尔谈欧美艺术史研究现状”，文字内容基本相同，可知此中文版序言应源自1993年作者一次谈话的记录文本）中说，这本书在1972年出版时的副标题定为“图画风格的社会史入门”，就是针对社会史学家写的，希望他们能够关注艺术风格，并使其作为一种历史档案来解读，使其成为过去…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[《妈妈教授：在学术界实现工作与家庭的平衡》，[美]瑞秋·康奈利、克里斯汀·戈德西著，李明倩、宋丽珏译，上海交通大学出版社｜雅理，2023年2月出版，305页，69.00元

“我巴不得进医院，至少能休息一阵子。”
“没错，我求之不得。管它是肺炎还是其他什么病，我就想在床上躺几天，一边看电视，一边等护士照顾。”
“肺炎还是太轻了。估计还需要带病工作。就算住院了，孩子们也会来探望。最好是得传染病，这样就能被隔离了。埃博拉病毒就不错。”
“我不太了解埃博拉……这可能会要了你的命呢。”
“埃博拉不会要了我的命，但能让我暂时忘记我是个妈妈，能让我享受几天清闲日子。”
“而且在医院，饮食起居都有人照料。”
“更没人会指指点点。”
“真的吗？这么看，埃博拉也没那么糟糕……”（《妈妈教授》，147页）
此类对话通常被称为“住院幻想”，这种念头不仅出现在《妈妈教授》作者们的书写里，更是作为妈妈的学术职业女性都有过的灵光乍现。尤其在孩子小的时候，面对隔几个小时就需要进食的人类幼崽和第二天就需要“交货”的急迫文稿，我们似乎都经历过一边抱娃，一边读文献、听讲座或是备课的窘迫阶段。成为一个好妈妈或是成为一个学界精英，似乎永远是二元迷思。瑞秋和克里斯汀在《妈妈教授》中给出了她们的答案：你可以拥有全部。两位作者勾勒了从博士阶段到毕业前求职、进入终身教职轨道、申请终身教职、直到成为一个正教授（full professor）的完整历程，借此告诉读者如何不让“母亲”身份与科研工作相冲突，做一名成功的“妈妈教授”。
冲出幻境，“真相”只有一个
不可否认，两位作者带给我们的并非心灵鸡汤，而是没有被粉砌过的学术妈妈的生活“真相”。学术界是个金字塔，很多人攻读博士学位进入学术行业，但能够不断向上晋升的人逐级减少。即使你没有子女，在很多领域要进入终身教职轨道的前景也并不乐观。在美国的高等教育体系中，进入终身教职轨道（t…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[cURL 发布 8.0，庆祝其 25 岁生日

它是一个用于用 URL 传输数据的命令行工具和库，任何认真编写通过网络进行交互的代码的开发人员都可能使用过 curl。如今，它估计已经被安装了超过 100 亿次。它的第一个版本是 4.0，发布于 1998 年，它仅有 2200 行代码，由 httpget 和 urlget 项目改编而成。当时只能支持三种协议，24 个命令行选项，而现在可以支持 28 种协议，249 个选项。


消息来源：The Register



老王点评：就这样一个原本的个人项目，现在居然发展成了互联网基石项目。




GitHub Copilot 将迁移到 GPT 上

GitHub 已经对其 Copilot 编程模型进行了培训，以执行新的任务，并有了一个新的名字 GitHub Copilot X。今后，Copilot 将依靠一套不断发展的大型语言模型，包括 OpenAI 的 GPT-3.5-turbo 和 GPT-4，而不是 OpenAI 的 Codex 的定制版本。OpenAI 将在 3 月 23 日关闭 Codex 的公共 API。根据 GitHub 的数据，截至上个月，Copilot 参与了微软的云代码库中 46% 的代码创建，并帮助开发者的编程速度提高了 55%。


消息来源：The Register



老王点评：通过 VSCode、GitHub、Copilot，微软似乎已经把开发者所需要的各个方面都掌握了。




Mozilla 将建立 Mozilla.ai

Mozilla 今天宣布，他们将投资 3000 万美元建立一个新的创业公司 Mozilla.ai，专注于 “建立一个值得信赖的、独立的、开源的 AI 生态系统”。Mozilla 称，“人工智能的核心是代理权、问责制、透明度和开放性。Mozilla.ai 将成为大科技公司和学术界之外的一个空间，供志同道合的创始人、开发人员、科学家、产品经理和建设者聚集。”

老王点评：虽然这又是一个 Mozilla “不务正业”的项目，但是希望可以为 AI 打造一个可信、独立的道路。]]></summary>

 I wonder why they don't come with standardized and desktop-agnostic Wayland compositor?
 The Wayland situation was like pre-DBus era where there's DCOP, COBRA, and Bonobo in terms of IPC however the IPC now was standardized regardless of Desktop Environment by Dbus.
 If the Linux IPC was succesfully standardized, they why Wayland doesn't?

compelling in a lot of ways, at least for those who want to promote
software freedom in the world.  Bradley Kuhn is certainly one of those
people and has long been working on various aspects of copyleft licensing

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This is a D&D map making tool I've been working on for a while now, but I just added some new features to the beta that I think HN users might find neat. When building a world map, you can use "Dynamic Brushes" to draw organic looking terrain. This is achieved entirely with svg filters and javascript canvas, no fancy libraries or anything. This came with a pretty large rewrite of some of the underlying code, so I'm sure there's a number of bugs I haven't come across, but I'd love to hear your opinions on it!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey HN! We launched Zapier way back in 2012 on HN: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4138415 and thought we'd return home to announce something special and hopefully exciting :) We are trying to finally live up to the "API" in our name with Zapier's first universal API:
Natural Language Actions – https://zapier.com/l/natural-language-actions
API docs – https://nla.zapier.com/api/v1/docs
(to be fair, we have published APIs before that can access Zapier data, but never before one devs can use to directly call the 5k+ apps / 20k+ actions on our platform)
For example, you can use the API to:
  * Send messages in Slack
  * Retrieve a row in a Google Sheet
  * Draft a reply in Gmail
  * ... and thousands more actions with one universal API

Folks have asked for an API for 10 years and I've always been slightly embarrassed we didn't have one. We hesitated because we did not want to pass along our universe of complexity to end devs. With the help of LLMs we found some cool patterns to deliver the API we always wanted.
My co-founder/CTO Bryan did an interview with Garry on YC blog with more details: https://www.ycombinator.com/blog/building-apis-for-ai-an-int...
We also published a LangChain integration to show off some possibilities:
  * Demo: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEK_9wLYEHU
  * Jupyter notebook: https://github.com/hwchase17/langchain/blob/master/docs/modules/utils/examples/zapier.ipynb

不过，上海第二中级法院的判决书并未提及“编程随想”博客，但检方指控阮晓寰在2009年6月至2021年5月期间，“编写百余篇造谣、诽谤的煽动性文章”，“透过境外平台发布攻击、抹黑中国现行政治体制、煽动颠覆国家政权、意图推翻社会主义制定”涉政博客，造成大量网民浏览、评论、转发、效仿等“恶劣后果”。


据悉，阮晓寰（1977年6月10日－），福建泉州人，居于上海杨浦，曾任国都兴业信息审计系统技术（北京）有限公司CTO，在2008年北京奥运会期间任职大会信息安全系统总工程师。2009年6月，编程随想的博客开通。2021年5月9日，博客停止更新，他失去网络踪迹，5月11日，被刑事拘留，后于6月17日被正式逮捕。2023年2月10日，阮晓寰被判定为煽动颠覆国家政权罪，刑期七年，剥夺政治权利两年，没收个人财产两万元，其妻子贝女士表示准备上诉二审。

        <link href="https://moonshineai.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html"/>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey HackerNews,
Today I'd like to share my open source project, Moonshine!
Pretrained vision models are a popular way to reduce how much data you need and to speed up training, but for remote sensing (i.e. aerial, satellite) it can be a challenge to find good weights. Why use Moonshine?
1. Pretrained on multispectral data: Existing popular CV packages are nice to use but are trained on ImageNet or similar, meaning that not only is the domain of the pretraining different, but you may be restricted to only 3 channels. For remote sensing platforms with multispectral data, this might be a non-starter. Moonshine includes models specifically trained for your remote sensing problems.
2. Focus on usability: There are academic releases of specialized models that do support remote sensing data, but often they are difficult to use. They might be hard to install, and often are supported by a grad student who is more focused on publication than software. A core tenant of Moonshine is that it should be easy to use.
I've been working on this project for nearly a year now and I'm really excited to show it off and most importantly get feedback! I have big plans for what to build in the future, but this set of features was the smallest one I could think of that would provide some value.

 One day it abruptly got shutdown and I remember there being controversy like I had heard there were legal issues and I had also heard it had gotten bought out by a "large" company.
 Does anyone remember this Distro and what actually happened to it? Was literally eating a pear at break today and thought about it hahaha.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[用树莓派取代食品售货机上的投币箱是一个天才之举。


作为在公共图书馆工作的教育工作者，我一直在关注 树莓派 的有趣用途。在我看来，得克萨斯州达拉斯市的问答售货机Trivia Vending Machine项目是这些神奇设备最具创意和最有趣的用途之一。使用树莓派取代食品售货机上的投币箱是 Greg Needel 和他的团队的一个天才之作。这个想法的潜在用途是深远的。请观看下面这个 YouTube 短视频，了解问答自动售货机的运行情况。




最初的问答售货机专注于科学问题，但你可以制作一个问答售货机来回答任何问题：历史、公民、文学等等。如果你鼓励学生写自己的问题，并回答对方的问题，那将是最有吸引力的用途。请考虑这样：自动售货机可以不发放食物，而是发放当地企业的优惠券。我谋生的方式之一是教吉他课，我很乐意捐出一节吉他课作为问答售货机的优惠券。然而，学生必须积累适当数量的积分才能获得我的一堂吉他课。

把你的想象力再延伸一点。是否有可能让学生解决逻辑谜题，以便从自动售货机获得食物（或优惠券）？是的，这并不难创造。也许是数独谜题、Wordle、KenKen、Sokoban 或任何其他谜题。学生可以用触摸屏玩这些谜题。国际象棋怎么样？当然，学生可以通过解决象棋谜题来获得食物（或优惠券）。

你是否注意到视频中原来的问答售货机又大又重？ 设计一个更小的，可能是滚动手推车大小的三分之一，这可以在学校、图书馆、博物馆和创客嘉年华之间更容易运输。

问答售货机的内部由步进电机组成。你可以在网上购买二手的。在网络上搜索“二手自动售货机电机”会出现 Vending World 和 VendMedic 网站。

如果你是创客空间的成员，请向其他成员介绍问答售货机。这是一个开放的发明，没有专利，所以任何人都可以制造它。（谢谢你，Greg Needel）我想为这样的设备编写代码并不太难。如果有人可以创建此类代码的 GitHub 仓库，以及可能附带的一些解释性截屏，那就太好了。

虽然问答售货机没有在红牛创意大赛中获奖，但这项发明还是值得获奖的。应该有人找到 Greg Needel 并给他一个合适的奖品。该奖项应该是什么样子的？可能是 2.5 万或 5 万美金的样子。我为 Greg Needel 和他的创意团队欢呼三声。他们把树莓派带到了这种计算机的发明者所希望的方向：修理工的快乐。大胆、美丽、开放。你还能要求更多吗？

最后一件事。问答售货机是几年前使用早期的树莓派型号制作的。当前的树莓派速度更快，响应更快。因此，你在上述视频中注意到的任何交互延迟在今天的树莓派上已不复存在。

哦，我非常想要一块糖果。我砸吧砸吧嘴。提醒我，我需要赚取多少积分才能获得士力架？不惜一切代价，我会不惜一切代价。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[你正在寻找 Linux 上最好的 EPUB 阅读器？这里是为你准备的最好的自由开源的 EPUB 阅读器。


你是一位热衷于阅读电子书的 Linux 用户吗？如果，是的，你必然知道在 Linux 发行版上的默认文档阅读器不能满足你作为一名书虫的所有要求。

EPUB 是一种广泛使用的开放电子书格式，大多数的电子书阅读器都支持。值得庆幸的是，在 Ubuntu 软件中心和其它存储库中有一些 EPUB 阅读器应用程序，你可以自由下载它们。.

但是，请记住，仅有几个好用的阅读器。并不是有很多！

在这篇文章中，我们将讨论在 Ubuntu Linux 上的最好的 EPUB 阅读器，这将增强你的阅读体验。我们也将探讨它们的特色功能和优点，以便你可以选择一个适合你的应用程序。

但是，在此之前，你认为在一个 “令人满意的” EPUB 阅读器中，应该有哪些功能呢？

在一款 EPUB 阅读器中所应该有的功能


用户界面：一款好的 EPUB 阅读器应该有一个简单易懂的用户界面，它会使导航和自定义你的阅读体验变得简单。你并不是在阅读一本实体书，因此，对于 “实体书” 的阅读体验来说，用户界面是极其重要的！

自定义：拥有自定义字体大小、字体类型、背景颜色和其它设置的能力，它们将增强你的阅读体验。

书架：书架是一种很方便的特色功能，它允许你组织你的 EPUB 文件和保持追踪你的阅读进度。

注释：在你的 EPUB 文件中，高亮显示、下划线和添加注释是一种很重要的特色功能，它会帮助你记住重点。

同步：如果你在多台设备上阅读 EPUB 文件，同步你的阅读进度和书签是非常重要的，可以避免丢失你的追踪进度.


现在，让我们看看为 Ubuntu 和其它的 Linux 发行版提供的最好的 EPUB 阅读器，它们都涉及上述所有的特色功能。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[一、富科传的汉译本
1834年，孟加拉亚洲学会（The Asiatic Society of Bengal）在加尔各答先后出版了匈牙利学者乔玛（Alexander Csoma de Kőrös, 1784-1842）编写的《藏英字典（试行本）》（Essay towards a Dictionary, Tibetan and English）和《藏语语法》（A Grammar of the Tibetan Language）。于此前后，乔玛还在《孟加拉亚洲学会会刊》（The Journal of the Asiatic Society of Bengal）和《亚细亚研究》（Asiatic Researches）上发表多篇论文，介绍藏文大藏经《甘珠尔》和《丹珠尔》的结构和内容，并根据藏译材料翻出佛陀的传记等。他的这些论著标志了现代的科学的西藏学的诞生。张相文（1867-1933）在《沌谷笔谈》卷四（收于张相文《南园丛稿》卷十二，中国地学会，1929年冬；《丛稿》有上海书店影印本）《佛化西行记》一文中根据日本学者的著作撮译过乔玛（觉摩）生平（图一），但内容多误，比如将乔玛的生年误为嘉庆六年（1801），乔玛去德国留学时（1816）也不是十八岁等。记中提到的“印度政厅特派员莫克伦”就是木尔齐喇普（William Moorcroft, 1770-1823），乔玛借览的“西藏语汇”指Antonio Agostino Giorgi（1711-1797）用拉丁语编写的Alphabetum tibetatum（1762）。在乔玛之后继续进行西藏学研究的，俄国有施密特（Isaak Jakob Schmidt, 1779-1847），法国则有富科（Philippe-Édouard Foucaux, 1811-1894）。

最近有两起俄罗斯开发者被阻止贡献 FOSS 代码的事件。在 Linux 内核邮件列表上，俄罗斯芯片制造商贝加尔电子公司的 Sergey Semin 的贡献被拒绝了，“我们对接受来自贵组织生产的硬件或与之相关的补丁感到不舒服。”另外一件也是针对俄罗斯开发者的，他的 GitHub 账户已被封锁。他开发的 “一个管理和配置支持智能平台管理界面的设备的工具”，ipmitool，被标记为只读“存档”。原因是他为俄罗斯芯片制造商 Yadro 工作，该公司正在研发 RISC-V 芯片，被列入了乌克兰的战争与制裁数据库。

这是一个源于安全考虑的决定，现代汽车公司的设计主管说，“对我来说，与安全有关的按钮必须是一个硬键，……很容易感知和感觉到它”。但未来的情况可能会发生变化。特别是，当自动驾驶成为主流时，该公司可能会更多地考虑使用触摸控制。“当涉及到 4 级自动驾驶时，那么我们将拥有一切软键。”

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[数据库管理员（DBA）的职责是什么？


在依赖 Postgres 作为主要数据库管理系统的现代 IT 组织中，Postgres DevOps DBA 发挥着关键作用。Postgres DevOps DBA 的角色涉及许多职责、技能和任务。其中一些包括：管理数据库设计和架构、基础设施管理、确保高可用性、安全性以及执行日常维护任务（调整、备份和恢复以及监控）。

本文总结了当今企业环境中 Postgres DevOps DBA 的常见职责和技能。

数据库设计和架构

Postgres DevOps DBA 的两个主要职责是数据库设计和架构。该角色必须对应用的数据存储要求和涉及的业务逻辑有更深入的了解。这些知识包括设计和创建数据库模式和表。它还意味着配置索引和其他数据库对象以优化查询性能，并选择使用正确的 Postgres 版本。该角色必须确保数据库的设计具有可扩展性和可维护性，同时考虑到未来的增长和数据保留需求。

性能调优

另一个关键的职责是性能调优。Postgres DevOps DBA 必须能够通过监控数据库性能指标和分析查询性能来识别和解决性能问题。该角色还必须对数据库有深入的了解，并能够对其进行配置以获得最佳性能，包括优化查询和索引、调整内存设置以及识别和解决性能瓶颈。

备份与恢复

备份和恢复也是职责的关键。DBA 必须对备份和恢复解决方案有深入的了解，并且必须设计和实施备份策略，以确保在数据丢失的情况下始终可以恢复数据。他们还必须验证恢复过程并实施高可用性和灾难恢复解决方案，以最大限度地减少停机时间和数据丢失。

安全

安全是另一个重要的职责。DBA 通过实施访问控制、加密和其他安全措施来保护数据，从而确保数据库安全。他们还必须了解最新的安全趋势和最佳实践，并加以实施以防范潜在威胁。

基础设施管理

基础设施管理也是一项重要职责。这些 DBA 必须管理硬件、网络和存储基础设施，并提供基础设施以支持 Postgres。他们还必须针对性能和可用性配置基础架构，并根据需要扩展基础架构以适应数据增长。

自动化和脚本

该角色必须能够使用 Ansible、Terraform 和 Kubernetes 等工具自动执行重复性任务，例如备份、监控和修补。他们还必须熟悉自动化最佳实践，以确保高效且有效地自动化任务。自动化减少了人为错误的可能性，提高了效率，并允许 DBA 专注于更复杂的任务。

监控和配置警报

监控数据库和基础设施并设置警报以通知他们问题非常重要。该角色还必须采取主动措施来防止停机和数据丢失，使用 Nagios、Zabbix 和 Prometheus 等监控工具来检测潜在问题。

合作

除了这些技术职责外，PostgreSQL DevOps DBA 还必须与其他 IT 团队（例如开发人员、运维人员和安全人员）协作，以将数据库集成到更大的 IT 生态系统中。DBA 还必须记录他们的工作，并及时了解 Postgres 和 DevOps 的最新趋势和最佳实践。这涉及与利益相关者合作以收集需求、确定优先级并使数据库与组织的更广泛目标保持一致。

总结

总之，Postgres DevOps DBA 在依赖 Postgres 作为主要数据库管理系统的现代 IT 组织中发挥着关键作用。你当前的技能和期望如何匹配此列表？作为现代数据库环境中的 DBA，你是否走在正确的道路上？

        <link href="https://github.com/jsvan/BusStopBloomfilter"/>
        <updated>2023-03-21T16:50:58.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello, 
I was running around Germany, hectically navigating public transportation, and getting lost all the time. I noticed that every station had i platforms, each used lists of n buses (trains, whatever) arriving, each has their list of m destinations. That means I would be scanning i x n x m items just to see if I was at the correct stop. As I was nervous, for every bus that arrived, I would rescan the list of stops to double check. I began thinking how I could make a better system.
Linked is a very shoddy mockup of how bloom filters could be used to allow passengers O(1) lookup time for which platform+bus is the correct one. I believe it's likely for public transportation to grow increasingly more complex in the future, as population grows, and under the current list-based system, this will make the signage ever more complex. I think some bloom filter mechanism could reduce that complexity.
So, here is my fantasy, my day dream. What do you think?

今年，在我基本上放弃了 MacBook，转而使用 NixOS 机器之后，我开始在与人进行视频通话时被要求“打开摄像头”。这是一个问题，因为我没有网络摄像头。我考虑购买一个，但后来我意识到我有一台完好无损的 2008 年产的佳能 EOS Rebel XS 数码单反相机放在书架上。这台相机有一个 mini-USB 接口，所以我自然而然地思考：一台数码单反相机、一个 mini-USB 接口和一台台式电脑，是否意味着我能拥有一个网络摄像头？

只有一个问题。我的佳能 EOS Rebel XS 不能录制视频。它可以拍摄一些漂亮的照片，仅此而已。所以这结束了？

还是有别的办法？

恰好有一个叫做 gphoto2 的神奇的开源软件。一旦安装，它允许你从计算机控制各种支持的相机，并拍摄照片和视频。

支持的相机

首先，了解你的设备是否得到支持：

$ gphoto2 --list-cameras


拍摄图像

你可以用它拍照：

$ gphoto2 --capture-image-and-download


快门触发，图像会保存到你当前的工作目录中。

录制视频

我意识到了这里的潜力，所以尽管我的相机没有视频功能，我还是决定尝试 gphoto2 --capture-movie 命令。不知怎么，尽管我的相机不支持视频功能，gphoto2 仍然能够生成一个 MJPEG 文件！

在我的相机上，我需要将其置于“实时预览”模式下，然后 gphoto2 才能录制视频。这包括将相机设置为纵向模式，然后按下 “设置Set” 按钮，使取景器关闭，相机屏幕显示图像。不幸的是，这还不足以将其用作网络摄像头。它仍然需要分配一个视频设备，例如 /dev/video0。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[👋 Hi, everyone, maintainer here.
 I'm thrilled to announce that Routr(v2) beta is now available, and it comes with some amazing features that bring us closer to matching Twilio's Elastic SIP Trunking.
 Routr (v2) is built from scratch, incorporating all the lessons we've learned from deploying v1 in cloud environments over the past few years.
 TLDR; → Routr(v2) at GitHub
 Here are some of the key features of Routr (v2) that we're excited about:
  
Common SIP Server functions; Proxy, Registrar, Location Service
 Multi-Domain with Domain level Access Control List
 Load balancing strategies against Media Servers like Asterisk and FreeSWITCH
 Programmable Routing
 In-memory and Redis Location Service
 Server management with a gRPC API
 Helm Chart for Kubernetes Deployments
  
And that's just the start - there are even more features and improvements in this release! You can find the full details on the GitHub repo.
 If you work with SIP, we would love for you to try out Routr and share your valuable feedback. Together, we can make Routr even better 🙏

BigScience 项目最近公布了 BLOOM，这是一个支持 46 种自然语言和 13 种计算机语言的 1760 亿个参数的模型，参数数量和性能与 GPT-3 相当。但它需要超过 350GB 的加速器内存，甚至需要更多的优化调整。他们开发了名为 Petal 的框架，可以以众包的方式在家用电脑上运行大语言模型。参与者可以运行客户端和服务器端，可以调整模型，子模块在训练后可以发布在模型中心，以便其他人可以利用它们进行推理或额外的训练。

老王点评：果然这种众包式的 AI 模型出现了，这可以有效避免 AI 被垄断。




谷歌将某多多应用标记为恶意程序

谷歌周一出于安全理由从其官方应用商店下架了某多多应用，将其标记为恶意程序。谷歌说，“这个应用的非谷歌商店版本被发现含有恶意软件，已经通过谷歌商店保护进行防范”。安卓内的安全机制将阻止用户安装它。对于已经安装的该应用的用户，谷歌建议用户卸载。当然，由于众所周知的原因，该应用主要出现在谷歌应用商店之外的厂商商店中。在这之前，多个中国安全研究人员披露该应用包含有恶意功能，居然利用零日漏洞提权来阻止卸载并监视用户。

老王点评：这种眼睛里面不揉沙子的，还得是谷歌。




生成式人工智能的下一个领域是视频

几个月来，像 DALL-E 和稳定扩散这样的服务一直在创造美丽的、引人注目的、有时令人不安的图片。现在，一家名为 Runway AI 的初创公司正在使用 AI 生成视频，该系统可以通过用户的几句话提示生成简短的视频片段。目前已经可以在几分钟内生成几秒钟长度的视频。


消息来源：彭博社



老王点评：逼真的图像已经可以生成，那生成视频所需的就是更多的资源。将来全 AI 创作的视频、电影，指日可待。]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[近日，华为公司在深圳坂田总部隆重举办“难题揭榜”火花奖颁奖典礼，华为创始人任正非发表讲话，重点提到了华为自研的MetaERP系统，引发“华为进军ERP市场” 的猜想。


据介绍，MetaERP是华为用自己的操作系统、数据库、编译器和语言做出的软件之一，目前华为已构筑起一套涵盖软件开发全流程、全环节的软件开发生产线，并形成了一站式、全流程、安全可信的作业平台，未来华为将基于该平台开发更多软件，也计划将软件开发工具开放给外界使用，让软件的生产工具走向自主可控，推动国产软件产业链高质量发展。


不过，据上证报晚间报道，华为相关人士告诉记者，华为MetaERP管理系统仅供内部使用，“进军ERP市场”系误读。


值得一提的是，华为“进军ERP市场”的猜想今日一度在资本市场引起较大反响，出于对华为进场“抢蛋糕”的担忧，行业龙头用友网络及金蝶国际纷纷遭遇投资者用脚投票。


用友网络今日低开低走放量跌停，截至收盘，跌停封单超2万手。金蝶国际的表现更为弱势，该股全天单边下跌，最终收跌近19%。


不过，该消息一度显著提振了华为产业链生态合作伙伴股价走强，赛意信息、润和软件、软通动力等股股价明显异动，其中赛意信息及软通动力今日均涨超8%。


ERP是一个以管理会计为核心可以提供跨地区、跨部门、甚至跨公司整合实时信息的企业管理软件，它是企业数字化转型的重要组成部分。据中银证券研报，我国ERP整体市场空间超400亿元，整体国产化率70%。不过，我国当前高端ERP整体国产化率较低，高端ERP市场SAP、Oracle等海外厂商占据超50%的份额。


国内市场方面，随着中国制造业自动化和信息化的持续扩张，企业对管理水平和效率的日益重视，企业管控一体化逐渐深化，国内ERP软件的需求保持着持续增长的态势。


从目前的市场格局来看，根据《2021工业软件发展白皮书》数据，用友、金蝶、浪潮三家厂商占据较大国产ERP市场的份额。其中用友网络是全球领先的企业云服务与软件提供商，通过构建和运行全球领先的商业创新平台—用友BIP，服务企业数智化转型和商业创新。金蝶国际拥有云苍穹、星空、星瀚等产品，深耕中小企业市场多年，凭借其市场地位，目前金蝶生态体系已覆盖超5000家伙伴，金蝶与战略合作伙伴在平台共研、产品集成及生态互惠等方面进行深度合作。


近期《数字中国建设整体布局规划》指出，建设数字中国是数字时代推进中国式现代化的重要引擎，是构筑国家竞争新优势的有力支撑。中信证券在3月14日的研报中指出，在政策端对数字中国产业的支持背景下，ERP作为重要组成部分，预计国内以大型央国企为首的企业体系迎来ERP支出快速放量。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[多测量几次总比测量一次好。我掉到坑里，希望你可以不用。


我想写一篇文章来演示“如何使用树莓派实现莫某的自动化”，或围绕树莓派的其他一些有趣、好奇或有用的应用。正如你可能从标题中意识到的那样，我不能再提供这样的文章了，因为我毁了我心爱的树莓派。

树莓派是每个技术爱好者办公桌上的标准设备。因此，大量教程和文章告诉你可以用它做什么。这篇文章反而涵盖了阴暗面：我描述了你最好不要做的事情！

电缆颜色

在谈到实际的破坏点之前，我想提供一些背景。在房屋内外进行电气工作时，你必须处理不同颜色的电缆。在德国，每栋房子都连接到三相交流电网，你通常会发现以下电缆颜色：


零线：蓝色

（PE）地线：黄绿色

（L1）火线 1：棕色

（L2）火线 2：黑色

（L3）火线 3：灰色


例如，给灯接线时，你接零线（N，蓝色）和火线（L，有 1/3 的机会是棕色），它们之间的电压为 230V 交流电。

连接树莓派

今年早些时候，我写了一篇关于 OpenWrt，家用路由器固件的开源替代品 的文章。在文章中，我使用了 TP-link 路由器设备。但是，最初的计划是使用我的树莓派 4。



我的想法是构建一个旅行路由器，我可以将其安装在我的大篷车中以改善露营地的互联网连接（我是那种离不开互联网的露营者）。为此，我在我的树莓派中添加了一个单独的 USB 无线网卡以连接第二个 Wifi 天线并安装了 OpenWrt。此外，我添加了一个 12V 至 5V DC/DC 转换器来连接大篷车中的 12V 接线。我用桌上的 12V 汽车电池测试了这个设置，它按预期工作。一切设置和配置完成后，我开始将其安装到我的大篷车中。

在我的大篷车里，我找到了一根蓝色和一根棕色的电线，将它与 12V 至 5V DC/DC 转换器相连，将保险丝放回，然后……



这个芯片，自己爆开了，它才是真正的降压变压器。我非常自信地认为蓝线是在 0V 电位上，棕色的是在 12V 上，我甚至没有测量。后来我了解到，蓝色的线是在 12V 上，而棕色的线是接地（这在汽车电子产品中很常见）。

总结

自从这次事故后，我的树莓派就再也启动不起来了。由于树莓派的价格飞涨，我不得不寻找替代品。幸运的是，我遇到了 TP-Link 旅行路由器，它也可以运行 Open-WRT 并且可以令人满意地完成它的工作。

最后：多测量几次总比测量一次好。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[黎锦光一生创作了数百首时代曲（上海老歌）。作家水晶在时代曲研究的早期著作《流行歌曲沧桑记》中有过隽语：“流行歌曲的三大名家是状元黎锦光，榜眼陈歌辛，探花姚敏。”（大地出版社，1985年2月版，90页）黎老笔下的传世佳作不止十首，如果像水晶先生那样点状元，《夜来香》无疑是首选。
《夜来香》自1944年发表以降，它的翻唱、改编版本合计已超过百种，其中有相当比例的录音来自日本。这与《夜来香》的首唱者是李香兰不无关联。这种祸福相依的关联，在流动的历史舞台上折射出不同的色彩，任意一束光射在黎锦光的身上，都有可能改变他的命运。在1981年受邀访日之前的三十多年里，黎锦光的命运是灰色的。
一
朱忠良1968年8月进中国唱片厂，他进厂后第一次见到黎锦光是在车间的厕所里。当时，年过六旬的黎老正在做清洁工作，推一辆沉重的平板车，上面堆满了水桶、箩筐以及其他洁具。朱忠良后来向车间里的一位老师傅打听，原来那位清癯、缄默、儒雅的保洁员是“我们这里音响方面的权威”，之前在编辑部任职。
所谓编辑部，当时对外的招牌是“中国唱片社上海分社”，本该在“中唱小红楼”（旧“百代小红楼”）办公，专门负责节目的编辑录音，即唱片的出版社。中国唱片厂与中国唱片社上海分社虽说在衡山路上是贴隔壁的邻居，其实是平行的、专职生产的另一个单位；唱片社当时归北京总社领导，再往上是广播事业管理局。

上世纪五十年代末，黎锦光在中国唱片厂出任音响导演时留影。


黎锦光与长子黎天旭合影，上世纪六十年代（供图：黎天旭）。

在一个特殊年代，唱片厂与唱片社的某些界限不复存在，唱片社的好些员工下放去了唱片厂。黎老的回忆是：“让我做清洁工，负责打扫厕所与洗澡间，每天反省，写回忆交代材料。由于要打扫洗澡间，因此我每天可以洗个热水澡。唱片厂的一位老工人（他是一位花匠，名字叫严福祥），每天给我泡好一杯茶，放在很高的窗台上，我要站在椅子上去取茶杯。”（…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[NixOS 中的打包系统是它最强大的地方。Nix 软件包管理器使用的语法与 apt、dnf 和其他软件包管理器大不相同。

这也是 人们应该尝试使用 NixOS 的原因之一。

在本指南中，我将分享两种在 NixOS 上安装和删除软件包的方法：


使用 Nix 软件包管理器

使用 configuration.nix 配置文件



⚠️ 使用 Nix 软件包管理器，你只能安装软件包，而不能安装 OpenSSH 或 Plex 服务器等服务。对于服务的安装，你必须使用 Nix 配置文件。


要安装任何软件包，必须知道它的确切名称，为此，我将从如何在 NixOS 中搜索软件包开始。

搜索软件包

要寻找软件包，你可以使用它的 网页搜索。

你可以使用如下步骤：


在搜索栏中输入软件包的名称

选择适当的软件包（从给出的描述中决定）

点击 “nix-env” 标签页

复制 NixOS 命令（第一条）


例如，如果我想要 librewolf 包，我将执行以下操作：



你也可以通过终端做同样的事情。

要使用终端搜索软件包，你可以按照给定的命令语法进行：

nix-env -qaP --description [软件包名称]


例如，在这里，我搜索了 librewolf：



你必须复制输出的第一行，因为那是你需要安装的软件包的名称。

在这里它是 nixos.librewolf。

是的，它听起来可能没有像使用 APT 或 DNF 时软件包名字那么方便。但是，我认为这并不是大问题。

一些妥协或许会换来一些好处？

在 NixOS 中安装一个软件包

要安装一个软件包，你所要做的就是使用以下命令语法：

nix-env -iA [软件包名称]


而且，如果你使用网络搜索来寻找软件包，你就…]]></summary>

I recently saw a Razer laptop video running Linux and the reviewer said intel iGPU support in Linux is bad and the battery optimization is also bad in Linux. And AMD performed better in his previous Razer but I hear lots of driver issues in AMD gpu in Linux and their support for features in Linux compared to windows is subpar.

 Today, I switched to Linux. Specifically Ubuntu Linux due to it being user friendly to me and I have some experience with it in the past using a Raspberry Pi 4. (Yes, I have about 5 years of experience with a raspberry pi and linux.)
 Before I made the switch to Linux, I used Windows 11. Windows 11 is a great operating system, but causes performance issues on my system because I only have 8gb ram (6.9gb due to the 1.1gb ram being used for my Vega 11 igpu). The system idles at about 4gb ram with all apps closed, and this means opening a browser (like b…]]></summary>

 Here is my idea; a linux & open source meetup/demo day; It would be an in-person event where I'd have different stations where you could demo linux (on librebooted thinkpads), raspberry pi's (have them hosting a bunch of services you could dabble with), pfsense (be able to explore the interface; grafana; monitor traffic ect.), pikvm (demo how to use), Tor (with bitcoin, and a node running, demo with test net coins), usb burning (ventoy demo, give out free usb drives with iso's), finally a graphene os, on pixel phone station where ppl can demo it.
 The whole idea about this is to help people who are interested in linux & open source to get their feet wet, and be able to see some of the opportunities in open source, and to begin to understand how it can help them achieve privacy/freedom in their day to day technology use..

 However, upon doing some research about the alternatives (OpenRC and Runit), they appear to also have the same capabilities, so I'm currently at a loss as to why the hate towards systemd specifically.

在马斯克收购 Twitter 前，Mastodon 有大约 50 万活跃用户。在马斯克一系列“神操作”之后，Mastodon 在 11 月份涌入了大量用户，高峰时每天新增逾 13 万用户。如今 Mastodon 的活跃度略有下降，每天能增加 4.5 万左右的用户，它的用户数目前刚刚超过一千万。顺便说一句，马斯克之前曾承诺在二月底开源 Twitter 的推荐算法，最新的 说法 是，他将在 3 月 31 日公开。

老王点评：Mastodon 还是有些不足，期待随着用户数量增加，可以更加完善起来。




Web3 基础设施基金会于香港成立

Web3 基础设施的技術涉及共识算法、联邦化、零知识证明、基于中继的协议、去中心化身份认证、可信计算、机密计算、操作系統运行时安全、软硬件供应链安全、区块链等多个领域。Web3 基础设施基金会于 2 月在香港成立，旨在推进 Web3 进程设施生态的发展。

老王点评：如果感觉 Web3 还距离较远，那其实是基础设施尚未发展成熟。这就如同近些年的互联网和 AI 等领域的发展，本质上都是基础设施进一步发展带来的。




AWS 发布 Amazon Linux 2023

自 2010 年以来，AWS 就提供了为云计算环境优化的 Linux 发行版，Amazon Linux 是 AWS 上使用最多的 Linux 发行版。本周他们宣布了其第三代版本：Amazon Linux 2023。AWS 称，在 Amazon Linux 2023 上部署工作负载有三大好处：“高安全标准、可预测的生命周期和一致的更新体验。”有趣的是，Amazon Linux 基于 Fedora Linux，但并非基于某个特定版本，而是包括了来自 Fedora 34、35 和 36 等多个版本的组件，并对一些组件进行了修改，其他组件与 CentOS Stream 9 中的组件更接近，或独立开发。除了 Fedora 的所提供的内核外，Amazon Linux 还提供了内核社区的其它长期支持内核。


消息来源：AWS



老王点评：每个云厂商都有个自己的 Linux 发行版，但是要是能不仅仅局限于自己的云，那就比较成功了。]]></summary>

3月16日下午，百度在北京总部召开新闻发布会，基于百度新一代大语言模型的生成式AI产品文心一言正式面世，官方展示了文心一言在文学创作、商业文案创作、数理推算、中文理解、多模态生成五个使用场景中的综合能力。


从现场展示来看，文心一言某种程度上具有了对人类意图的理解能力。但李彦宏也多次提及，这类大语言模型还远未到发展完善的阶段，进步空间很大。


百度官方今日宣布：文心一言云服务将于3月27日14:00举行新品发布会，敬请期待。


对于这款产品，百度创始人、董事长兼首席执行官李彦宏此前在发布会上说，“文心一言对标ChatGPT，门槛是很高的，全球大厂还没有一个做出来的，百度是第一个，我自己测试感觉还是有很多不完美的地方。我们大家都希望文心一言能够快速成长，能够尽早地给用户和客户带来价值。”


在3月17日的亚布力论坛第二十三届年会上，李彦宏回应记者表示外界对文心一言的反馈跟我预期差不多，ChatGPT刚出来的时候反馈比文心一言还要糟糕。


截至3月20日下午13点，文心一言发布4天，已有21家企业完成首批签约合作，申请文心一言API调用服务测试的企业已有10万多家。目前，个人用户可以进入文心一言官网参与排队试用。企业用户可以进入百度智能云官网，申请预约文心一言API接口调用服务测试。


据悉，百度已经在3月16日公布了文心一言的邀请测试方案。3月16日起，首批用户即可通过邀请测试码，在文心一言官网体验产品，后续将陆续开放给更多用户。此外，百度智能云即将面向企业客户开放文心一言API接口调用服务。3月16日起正式开放预约，搜索“百度智能云”进入官网，可申请加入文心一言云服务测试。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[到目前为止，在这个终端基础系列中，你已经学会了：


更改目录

创建新目录

列出目录内容


现在让我们学习如何在 Linux 命令行中创建文件。我将简要讨论向文件添加内容。但是，稍后将介绍有关编辑文本文件的详细信息。

使用 touch 命令创建一个新的空文件

使用 touch 命令非常简单。

touch filename


切换到你的主目录并创建一个名为 practice_files 的新目录，然后切换到该目录：

mkdir practice_files && cd practice_files



💡 && 是一种组合两个命令的方法。只有当第一个命令执行成功时，第二个命令才会运行。


现在，创建一个名为 new_file 的新文件：

touch new_file


就是这样。你刚刚创建了一个新的空文件。

列出目录内容并使用 ls -l 命令检查文件的属性。




💡 touch 命令的最初目的是“触摸”文件并更改其时间戳。如果提供的文件不存在，它会创建一个具有该名称的新文件。


使用 echo 命令创建一个新文件

很久以前我就应该向你介绍 echo 命令。迟到总比不到好。echo 命令显示你提供给它的任何内容。因此得名“回声”。

echo Hello World


你可以使用重定向并将输出路由到文件。因此在此过程中创建一个新文件：

echo "Hello World" >> other_new_file


这样，你将创建一个名为 other_new_file 的新文件，其中包含文本 Hello World。



请记住，如果提供的文件已经存在，使用 >> 重定向，你将向文件添加一个新行。你也可以使用 > 重定向，但它会替换文件的现有内容。

更多关于重定向的信息可以在下面的教程中找到。


解释：Linux 中的输入、输出和错误重定向


使用 cat 命令创建新文件

cat 命令的最初目的是连接文件。但是，它主要用于显示文件的内容。

它还可以使用选项创建新文件并添加内容。为此，你可以使用相同的 > 和 >> 重定向。

cat >> another_file


但是这个将创建一个新文件并允许你向其中添加一些文本。添加文本是可选的。你可以使用 Ctrl+d 键退出 cat 输入模式。



同样，附加模式 >> 在文件内容的末尾添加新文本，而覆盖模式 > 用新内容替换现有内容。


🖥️ 使用 ls -l 长列表显示并注意时间戳。现在 touch 文件：


touch other_new_file


你看到时间戳的区别了吗？

测试你的知识

你已经了解了如何创建新文件。这里有一些简单的练习来练习你刚刚学到的东西。它也包括前几章的一些内容。


使用 touch 命令创建三个新文件，分别命名为 file1、file2 和 file3。提示：你不需要运行 touch 三次。

创建一个名为 files 的目录，并在其中创建一个名为 my_file 的文件。

使用 cat 命令创建一个名为 your_file 的文件，并在其中添加以下文本 “This is your file”。

使用 echo 命令将新行 “This is our file” 添加到 your_file。

以相反的时间顺序显示所有文件（请参阅第 3 篇）。现在使用 touch 命令修改 file2 和 file3 的时间戳。现在再次按时间倒序显示内容。


这很有趣。你正在取得很好的进步。你已在本章中学会了创建新文件。接下来，你将学习如何查看文件的内容。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[符合 描述性状态迁移REpresentational State Transfer（LCTT 译注：REST，译自审定公布名词数据库）的应用程序接口（API）无处不在。有趣的是又有多少人真正了解“符合描述性状态迁移”的应有之义呢？

大概我们中的大多数人都会跟 黑客新闻网站上的这篇公开问答 产生共鸣：


我阅读了几篇介绍描述性状态迁移（REST）的文章，甚至包括原始论文的部分章节。然而我仍然对REST 到底是什么只有一个相当模糊的想法。我开始认为没有人真的了解它，它仅仅是一个定义相当不充分的概念。


我曾经计划写一篇有关 REST 的博客，在里面探讨 REST 是如何成为这样一个在网络通信领域占主导地位的范式的。我通过阅读 2000 年发表的 罗伊·菲尔丁Roy Fielding 的博士论文 开始我的研究，这篇博士论文向世人介绍了 REST 的概念。在读过菲尔丁的博士论文以后，我意识到，相比之下，更引人注意的是菲尔丁的理论缘何受到如此普遍的误解。

（相对公平地说，）很多人知道 REST 源自菲尔丁的博士论文，但并没有读过该论文。因此对于这篇博士论文的原始内容的误解才得以流行。

最大的误解是：这篇博士论文直接解决了构建 API（API）的问题，我此前一直认为 REST 从一开始就打算成为构建在超文本传输协议（HTTP）之上的 网络 APIWeb API的架构模型，我相信很多人也这样认为。我猜测此前可能存在一个混乱的试验时期，开发人员采用完全错误的方式在 HTTP 基础上开发 API，然后菲尔丁出现了，并提出了将 REST 做为网络应用程序开发的正确方式。但是这种想法的时间线对不上：我们今天所熟知的网络服务的 API 并非是在菲尔丁出版他的博士论文之后才出现的新生事物。

菲尔丁的博士论文《架构风格与基于网络的软件架构设计》不是讨论如何在 HTTP 的基…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[《〈读书〉十年》（百花文艺出版社，2019年）分日记四册和友朋书札一册。前四册文史俱佳，是扬之水与古为邻、转益多师、进学悟道的忠实记录。日记中有多处关乎如何写文章的记载。摘引数条，不求甚解，略微引申，作为虎兔交替之际的读书乐趣。

一
1987年1月13日
近由上海译文社出版的《无边的现实主义》是一本在东西方理论界都引起强烈反响的书，其中收录了法国著名文艺批评家加洛蒂关于毕加索、圣琼·佩斯和卡夫卡的三篇评论。作者认为，应该开放和扩大现实主义的定义，根据这些当代特有的作品，赋予现实主义新的尺度，从而使我们能够把这一切新的贡献同过去的遗产融为一体。
《无边的现实主义》，书名应该是《论无边的现实主义》，出版社是上海文艺出版社。
二
1987年2月2日
在《文艺报》上读到汪曾祺的《林斤澜的矮凳桥》。
汪的小说，我是一向爱读的，未晓他的评论也是写得这般好，并未搬弄名词和概念，亦无不着边际的联想和引申，却将不大能读懂的斤澜小说析得深且透。

1995年秋，林斤澜和汪曾祺在温州

在文学创作中，汪曾祺极为看重语言。他认为语言要多方学习。语言的独创性，“不是离奇、生造，而是别人想说能说，但没有说或说不出来，你把它准确地说出来，别人一看，你把他的意思说出来了，并且感到新鲜、准确，独特，这就是独创性”（《汪曾祺全集》第9卷，人民文学出版社，2019年，181页）。在《林斤澜的矮凳桥》一文里，汪曾祺直言读他老友的小说有些费事，没有把握写这篇评论。他“佩服”一些评论家“能把一个作家的作品分析得头头是道，说得作家自己目瞪口呆”。他抓住“桥”“幔”“人”“涩”四个点，指明了林斤澜小说的特征和意蕴。林斤澜把温州话熔入文学语言，汪曾祺以为是成功的，但又建议不妨把语言“稍为往回拉一点，更顺一点”，将“顺”和“涩”统一起来（《汪曾祺全集》第9卷，403-410页）。
汪曾祺还有一篇专门写林斤澜的文章，题目取得…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am working on building a gaming console on Ubuntu. I already have all of the games etc running properly through dolphin emulator. The current issue is, upon startup, I need a mouse and keyboard to select a game and hit play. I am looking for an application with controller-compatible GUI that can be used to either run pre-written terminal commands (run dolphin game through terminal) or one that can just do simple application shortcuts, in which case I can probably just figure out a way to link it with games on the dolphin emulator. Otherwise I will probably build a python application. I am definitely new to python so that's more of a long term solution. Any relevant libraries that can be used in the application project would be appreciated too. Open to suggestions. I will be using xbox controller, OG gamecube controller, and a wii controller. I know I won't find anything compatible with the wii controller, but it would be cool to find an application that can handle custom controller binds so the GCN controller would be compatible. 
 Thanks!

今年已 80 岁的 Ken Thompson 是 Unix、C 语言、Go 语言等一系列重要项目的共同创造者。他在最近的一次演讲中，回答了一个问题 “如今使用什么操作系统？”他说，“在我生命中的大部分时间里都在运行苹果操作系统。”但最近五年他开始对苹果不太满意了，而最近几个月，他把它扔了，使用 Linux 了，尤其是树莓派上运行的 Raspbian，即树莓派操作系统。这引来了在场观众的掌声。

大语言模型涌现无法预测的能力

2017 年谷歌大脑的研究人员提出了被称为 转化器Transformer 的新型架构（即 GPT 中的 “T” —— 生成式预训练转化器），它能并行处理大块文本，能通过增加模型的参数快速扩展语言模型的复杂度。2020 年 OpenAI 的研究人员发现随着参数规模的增加，大语言模型改进了其能力和准确度。但大语言模型也同时带来了一些始料未及的东西。研究人员发现大语言模型产生了数以百计的“新”能力，这种行为被称为“涌现emergent”。了解涌现可揭示出 AI 和一般机器学习深层问题的答案，如复杂模型是真的在做新事情，还是极其擅长统计。

让 Python 和 C 语言性能相当的新编译器

Codon 是一个新的 “高性能 Python 编译器，它可以将 Python 代码编译为本地机器代码，没有任何运行时间的开销”。与 Python 相比，在单线程上，典型的速度提升是 10-100 倍或更多。而且 Codon 支持原生多线程，这可以使速度再提高许多倍。Codon 的性能与 C/C++ 的性能相当（有时甚至更好）。用户只需像他们习惯的那样写 Python，而不必担心数据类型或性能，Codon 会自动处理这些问题，他们的代码运行速度比普通 Python 快 10 到 100 倍。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[研究一下这个框架，来建立你自己的开源项目的数据分析。


在数据分析的黄金时代，开源社区也不能免俗。大家都热衷于将一些华丽的数字放到演示幻灯片上，但如果你掌握了正确的分析方法，这些信息可以为你带来更大的价值。

或许你认为作为一名 数据科学家，我会告诉你数据分析和自动化能为你的社区决策提供信息。但实际上，情况恰恰相反。利用数据分析来构建你现有的开源社区知识，吸收其他的知识，并发现潜在的偏见和没有思考过的观点。你或许是实施社区活动的专家，而你那些同事则是代码方面的专家。当你们每个人都在自己的知识背景下将信息可视化时，你们都可以从这些信息中受益。

让我们来面对现实吧。每个人都有一千零一件事情要做，而且总感觉一天的时间永远不够用。如果需要几个小时才能得到你的社区的答案，你就不可能有足够的精力去解决这些事情。但是，花时间创建一个全面发展的可视化项目，可以帮助你时刻掌握你所关心的社区的不同方面，这就将你从精疲力尽中解放了出来。

随着“数据驱动”思维的盛行，围绕开源社区的信息宝库可能是一种祝福，也可能是一种诅咒。下面我将分享一些方法，告诉你如何从数据干草堆中挑出有价值的信息。

你的预期是什么？

当考虑一个指标时，首先要明确你想提供的观点。以下是几个可能涉及的概念：

告知性和影响性的行动： 你的社区是否存在某个领域尚未被理解？你是否已迈出第一步？你是否试图确定特定方向？你是否正在衡量现有倡议的效果？

暴露需要改进的领域和突出优势： 有时你想宣传你的社区，突出它的优势，特别是在试图证明商业影响或为项目宣传时。然而，当涉及到向社区内部传递信息时，你通常需要从一堆指标中精准的找到你们的缺点，以此来帮助你们改进。虽然突出优点并非不可取，但需要在适当的时间和地点。不要把优势指标作为社区内部的拉拉队，告诉每个人都有多棒，而是要与外界分享，以获得认可或推广。

        <id>https://www.williamlong.info/archives/7109.html</id>
        <link href="https://www.williamlong.info/archives/7109.html"/>
        <updated>2023-03-19T07:44:36.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[3月8日消息，TikTok当地时间周三推出“三叶草计划”（Project Clover），提出每年将在保护超1.5亿欧洲用户的措施上花费12亿美元，并承诺将欧洲TikTok用户数据存储在本地。


相关计划包括几周内在爱尔兰开设两个数据中心，今年晚些时候在挪威开设第三个中心。TikTok称，目前存储在新加坡和美国的欧洲用户数据将转移到这三个中心。一旦投入使用，这三个数据中心的年度总投资额将达到12亿欧元。


TikTok负责欧洲政府关系的副总裁Theo Bertram表示，该公司还计划最终宣布一个欧洲合作伙伴，该合作伙伴将监督该应用如何处理欧洲大陆的数据。他说，TikTok已经在与该合作伙伴合作，但尚未准备好公布其名称。


消息人士称，TikTok公司高管周一告诉英国的政策制定者，该公司是一家已经提供了前所未有透明度并接受独立监督的科技公司，尤其是相比于美国社交媒体平台脸书（Facebook）母公司Meta等竞争对手。


参加了TikTok英国简报会的一些与会者称，他们赞赏该公司为展示透明度所做的艰苦努力，但仍因美方散布的说法“TikTok可将用户数据移交给中国官方”而对其持怀疑态度。TikTok公司发言人周一表示，该公司将很快公布计划在欧洲实施的行业领先的数据安全措施的细节。


据消息人士透露，参加这场简报会的TikTok高管包括其驻美国的总法律顾问埃里希·安德森（Erich Andersen）。高管们在简报中告诉英国的政策制定者，计划最终会将欧洲用户的数据存储在欧洲的计算机服务器中。


这些消息人士还称，TikTok公司还计划聘请一家欧洲第三方公司独立监督该平台在欧洲的运营，以防止发生未经授权的数据传输，而美国甲骨文公司将监督TikTok对其视频推荐系统的改动。


消息人士说，TikTok公司高管表示，他们已经与英国国家网络安全中心（NCSC）进行过讨论，该中心是英国情报部门之一。消息人士说，TikTok高管表示，他们相信NCSC并不认为TikTok处理其用户数据的方式具有风险。


报道指出，此前TikTok高管已向美国政客和监管机构介绍过“得州计划”，该计划与其在欧洲的对应计划有所不同，因为“得州计划”向华盛顿承诺美国用户数据不会存储在TikTok自己的服务器上，而是存储在位于得克萨斯州奥斯汀市的TikTok合作伙伴、美国甲骨文公司的服务器上。


一段时间以来，美国一直以“国家安全”为名打压TikTok。美国前总统特朗普于2020年发布行政命令，禁止TikTok在美国运营，但在针对该措施的一系列法庭诉讼中败诉。据路透社报道，TikTok去年6月已完成将美国用户的数据信息迁移到甲骨文公司的服务器，从而解决了美国监管机构得担忧。然而，美国联邦通信委员会委员布兰登·卡尔去年11月仍建议美国外国投资委员会采取行动禁止TikTok在美国运营。


《华尔街日报》报道还提到，最近几个月，美国联邦政府和部分州政府，以及欧盟和加拿大宣布禁止其政府雇员在工作设备上使用TikTok。而美国的盟友英国和澳大利亚并没有对此效仿并实施这类禁令。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Firefox 111 已发布，带来了原生通知、新增的本地化语言以及增强的 Web 平台功能。




Firefox 111 发布亮点



Firefox，一个流行的网络浏览器，已经发布了 111 版本，其中引入了几个新功能和增强功能。其中一个突出的新增功能是支持 Windows 原生的系统通知，为整个平台提供了更流畅和一致的用户体验。

除此之外，Firefox Relay 用户现在可以轻松地从 Firefox 凭据管理器中直接创建 Relay 邮箱。此功能仅适用于登录了 Firefox 帐户的用户，为其在线活动提供了额外的隐私和安全保护。

另外，Firefox 111 已经通过添加两个新的语言 – 弗留利语Silhe Friulian（fur）和 撒丁语Sardinian（sc）– 来扩大其语言支持列表。这一举措旨在为世界各地的 Firefox 用户提供更好的可访问性和包容性。

在 Web 平台方面，Firefox 已经在表单元素上引入了 “rel” 属性，使开发人员可以更轻松地指定当前文档与表单目标之间的关系。这一功能与其他浏览器兼容，并简化了 Web 应用程序的开发过程。

最后，Firefox 已经启用了 原点私有文件系统访问origin private file system access，这是一种新的存储 API，允许 Web 应用程序在沙箱中存储和检索文件系统中的数据。这一增强功能为开发人员提供了对数据存储和检索过程的更多控制，确保用户数据的安全性和隐私性。

下载和更新

对于 Linux 发行版，如果你通过发行版的官方仓库使用 Firefox，那么你应该在几天内获得此更新。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[霍华德·艾兰与迈克尔·詹宁斯（章静绘）

“……我多元的信念所代表的那个矛盾而流动的整体”——二十世纪犹太裔德国批评家、理论家、文人瓦尔特·本雅明（1892-1940）曾如此形容自己的思想生活。他的多样作品、不幸经历以及迟来的声名，不论在英语世界还是中文世界，仍然散发着近乎奥义般的吸引力。去年，美国布兰代斯大学副教授王璞历时八年将英语世界乃至世界范围内最翔实完整的《本雅明传》（Walter Benjamin: A Critical Life）译成中文。近日，《上海书评》特邀艾江涛和王璞采访了这本传记的两位作者——普林斯顿大学德语系教授迈克尔·詹宁斯（Michael W. Jennings）和麻省理工学院荣休文学讲师霍华德·艾兰（Howard Eiland），请他们谈谈本雅明的批评理论，以及他的同时代人。

《本雅明传》，[美]霍华德·艾兰、迈克尔·詹宁斯著，王璞译，上海文艺出版社，2022年7月出版，908页，145.00元

您能谈谈您的本雅明研究之路吗？在《本雅明传》的写作过程中，您和艾兰教授是如何具体分工的？
迈克尔·詹宁斯：我是在研究生阶段接触到本雅明的作品的，当时立即被他的散文之美和思想之深所吸引。我的博士论文讨论了本雅明的早期作品，第一本书《辩证意象》（Dialectical Images: Walter Benjamin’s Theory of Literary Criticism, 1987）是最早的对他的文学批评理论的介绍。哈佛大学出版社曾委托我担任本雅明文选英文版（Selected Writings，1996-2003）的总编辑，霍华德·艾兰与我合作完成了所有四卷的编辑工作。当我们决定写本雅明的传记时，我们把他的人生一分为四，每人负责两部分（霍华德负责1892到1919年以及1928到1933年，我负责1920到1928年以及1933到1940年）。我们…]]></summary>

        <link href="https://www.backoflabel.com/"/>
        <updated>2023-03-19T00:31:59.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I made a table where you can find out the source/location of factory for where health supplements are made. Then, I spent a year reading product labels so you can save time and money when buying supplements. This is that update.
This is still a work in progress but it functions fine.
My previous post was a simple database of company data showing ingredient sourcing/location. That took 10 days, this has taken me close to 9 months. BackOfLabel is an extension of that initial interest with dosage information at the product & ingredient level.
This update allows sorting by many more attributes at the product level (for 4000+ products at the moment) of manually scraped data.
Now, for instance you can sort by specific types of ingredient - eg. filter by magnesium glycinate , magnesium orotate or any combination. eg. find ubiquinol or ubiquinone, two forms of coenzyme q10. This is useful for consumers but also companies seeking competitor analysis.
You are able to filter products by
– Ingredient
– Filter by liquid, tablet, capsule, powder & more
– Browse by UPC Code
– Dosage Information
– No. Individual Serving
– No. Manufacturer Serving
– Total Dosage
For example You can also search by type of protein powder - eg. search for whey protein powder and find the dosage information for many products instantly.
It frustrates me and I think the way that people buy supplements is wrong. And they don't know any better because there are incentive structures that keep them in the dark. This is a small effort to combat the misleading labeling and lack of regulation in the industry.
full disclosure - i've provided a generic affiliate link in the table that means i earn a small percentage (5%) of total cart if you purchase through the link
note: browse on desktop to filter & sort

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, I’m an open source LLVM Developer. LLVM job market is hot and before the tech slowdown recruiters used to frequently reach out to me on LinkedIn. I wanted to add another skill to my portfolio and was thinking of trying out Linux contributions. I wanted to know if it’s worth the effort, and if there is a solid demand for linux developers.
 I also wanted to know if it will be too hard or easy for me to work on Linux - given that I already have some experience with LLVM, or does this not matter at all?
 Plus, where should I get started - and what would a smooth workflow for a Linux developer look like? I don’t want to keep replacing my kernel every time, because I know I am gonna mess it up. I have an old system, and on first impression, I am not a fan of the email based contributions that Linux adopts. I remember not liking Phabricator in the beginning too, but it grew on me and now I love it. Is the mail based contribution system good, or is it gonna be a pain forever?
 Thank you! Looking forward to some guidance from the sub :)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[北京时间3月9日上午消息，据报道，最新消息显示，谷歌已经在内部提出要求，在几个月时间里将“生成式人工智能”技术集成到所有主要产品中。


人工智能本应该是谷歌的优势。多年来，谷歌一直在进行各种长远的技术投资，支撑前一代人工智能聊天机器人的许多研究都是在谷歌旗下实验室完成的。然而，创业公司OpenAI于去年11月推出了ChatGPT，成为“生成式人工智能”领域的早期领导者。生成式人工智能软件可以自行生成文本、图像或视频。它的突然成功让谷歌母公司Alphabet不得不加快速度，试图在这个领域迎头赶上。Alphabet首席执行官桑达尔·皮查伊（Sundar Pichai）也强调，这项技术可能“将比火和电的意义更深远”。


ChatGPT被一些人视为传统谷歌搜索引擎的终极挑战者。而考虑到OpenAI与微软的密切关系，ChatGPT似乎带来了双重威胁。根据谷歌在职员工、前员工，以及其他与该公司关系密切的人士的说法，目前谷歌的感觉是，自己在一个关键的优势领域处于落后位置，因此在公司内部引发了不小的焦虑。正如一名在职员工所说：“对任何与人工智能相关的项目都同时会有异常高的期望和极大的不安全感。”


谷歌一名前员工说，这方面的工作也让皮查伊本人回到了产品经理的日子，深入到产品功能的细节中去，而这些工作通常是由远低于他职级的员工来完成的。与几年前相比，谷歌联合创始人拉里·佩奇（Larry Page）和谢尔盖·布林（Sergey Brin）也开始更多地参与公司的工作，布林甚至向谷歌的同类产品Bard提交了代码更改。一名知情人士透露，谷歌高级管理层已经宣布“红色指令”，其中要求谷歌的所有重要产品，包括用户数超过10亿的产品，必须在未来几个月内集成生成式人工智能技术。例如，谷歌于3月份宣布，YouTube视频平台的创作者很快就可以使用这项技术来虚拟换装。


这也让一些谷歌员工…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[1700年5月13日伦敦，众多作家、演员、音乐家、出版商和政治家等前来参加桂冠诗人德莱顿的葬礼，其中有十几位来自一个成立于1690年代的“基特猫”俱乐部（Kit-Cat Club）。这样开场，显然是有寓意的，这是“猫仔们”（Catlings）命运转折的时刻。自此，“猫仔们”尝试引领英国文明的进程——尤其是在德莱顿最喜欢的文学和音乐领域，肩负起他们的“爱国责任”，大力培养英国本土的艺术人才。
集体肖像的两条线索

《“基特猫”俱乐部》书封

《“基特猫”俱乐部》（the Kit-Cat Club，London: Harper Press，2008；以下引用本书均只标注页码）的特点之一，是众多传记的缀合，最后一章（“尾声”）可以看作这幅集体肖像的“文献综述”。不妨以读者熟知的英国散文大家艾狄生（Joseph Addison）和斯蒂尔（Richard Steele）为例，略作介绍。十八世纪的书商柯尔（Edmund Curll）以第三人称撰写的《回忆录》，可以算作最早的群体传记，该书付梓之际，艾狄生刚刚去世。诗人蒲柏的《致阿布思诺医生》（1734）自然也是不可或缺的文献之一，其中的名句“阳里不屑一顾，阴里无限嫉妒”“明里把头点，暗中白一眼”，几乎奠定了半个艾狄生的形象。约翰生博士的《诗人传》，也选择性地征用了这些材料。其实，大多“猫仔”都在《诗人传》中露过脸。约翰生同情艾狄生，低估了斯蒂尔，尽管他也认识到后者的个人魅力。浪漫主义作家当然不会亦步亦趋。柯勒律治力挺斯蒂尔，认为他充满“十足的人性，这源于他的温和，心地善良”；黑兹利特（William Hazlitt）也喜欢斯蒂尔作品里“自然的印记”（384页）。

艾狄生（Joseph Addison）

整个十九世纪，艾狄生和斯蒂尔在英国正典中的地位是相当稳固的，部分原因自然是《旁观者》和《闲谈者》的大量发行，以及那些迎合英国学校、家…]]></summary>

一直有一些开源项目致力于创建 Flash 的自由软件实现，虽然在 2020 年被 Adobe 正式停用 Flash 之前没有取得足够的进展。有人用 Rust 编写了一个名为 Ruffle 的 Flash 播放器模拟器，可以在所有主要的操作系统上工作，并可以通过 WebAssembly 在现代浏览器上工作。由于 Rust 的内存安全保证，他们认为这是一个安全的 Flash 实现。他们的目标是让所有现有的 Flash 内容在 Ruffle 中工作。

老王点评：要是早些年 Adobe 就用 Rust 重写 Flash 呢？




新版 AI 图像合成服务 Midjourney 的逼真图像令人震惊

Midjourney v5 现在正在 Alpha 测试，有测试者对新版本产生的逼真图像感到震惊，“就像在视力模糊太久后终于戴上了眼镜”。自 2022 年 3 月 Midjourney 首次出现以来，它每隔几个月就发布一个新的版本。Midjourney 的工作方式与稳定扩散和 DALL-E 等图像合成器类似，它根据被称为 “提示” 的文本描述，使用在数百万件人类艺术作品上训练出来的人工智能模型生成图像。

老王点评：AI 的进步已经是不可估量的了。




三星、VIVO 等安卓手机出现高危远程漏洞

谷歌的安全研究部门在过去几个月里三星生产的 Exynos 调制解调器中发现并报告了 18 个零日漏洞，其中包括四个最严重的缺陷，可以通过蜂窝网络静默、远程地破坏受影响的设备。只需要知道电话号码，攻击者可以在没有用户互动的情况下远程控制手机的基带层，在不惊动受害者的情况下获得流入和流出受影响设备的数据，这包括手机通话、文本信息和手机数据。受影响的设备包括几十种安卓机型、可穿戴设备和车辆，涉及到三星、VIVO、谷歌等手机，以及一些采用该芯片的车联网设备。


消息来源：Tech Crunch



老王点评：这种漏洞非常可怕，虽然大部分人都不太担心自己的隐私和数据。]]></summary>

超过 870 个维基百科及其附属网站 提供了多语言版本，它们服务于一个共同目标，“开发自由的教育内容，并有效地在全球范围内传播”。例如，维基共享资源Wikimedia Commons 是一个自由的媒体文件库，截至今天，它已经拥有超过 6800 万张图片。维基文库Wikisource 是一个自由的文本资源库，拥有超过 500 万篇文章和 72 种语言的活跃网站子域名。维基数据Wikidata 是一个可访问的数据存储库，包含被 多个与维基百科相关的网站 所使用的超过 9900 万个数据项。

这些项目由 维基媒体基金会Wikimedia Foundation 支持和维护，它是一个总部位于旧金山的非营利组织。基金会使全球数十万名志愿者为项目的自由知识作出贡献。在这个知识收集和生产的社区背后，有着大量的维护、技术支持和管理工作，以保持网站的正常运转。当然，从外部来看，你可能仍然好奇，开发维基百科的软件还需要做哪些工作。毕竟，它可是世界上最受欢迎的十大网站之一，致力于提供最好的信息。

事实上，每篇维基百科的文章都借助了成千上万的软件工具来创建、编辑和维护。这些步骤，确保了你在世界任何地方都能获得公平可靠快速的信息。当你浏览维基百科或任何其他维基网站时，你是在与一个称之为 MediaWiki 的软件交互，这是一个强大的团队协作文档软件，用以支持维基百科的内容。它有一些默认特性，而为了进一步增强软件的功能，你可以安装各种扩展。数不胜数的扩展中，最著名的两个是：

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Kali Linux 2023.1 发布了重大更新，并引入了一个新的变体 “Kali Purple”。




在 Kali Linux 的 10 周年纪念，该团队为你准备了一些好东西。Kali Linux 2023.1 是 Kali Linux 的常规软件包更新，它带来了最新的桌面环境和主线内核更新。

Kali Linux 2023.1 推出 Kali Purple

这个版本的主要亮点是 Kali Purple，这是 Kali Linux 的一个新变体，带有 “防御性安全” 工具。Kali 团队目前正在将其作为技术预览版发布。

防御性安全软件可以实现各方面的安全加固，如漏洞扫描、事件跟踪和响应、数据包捕获、入侵检测等。现在你可以使用 Kali Purple 为你的应用程序或企业内置的所有工具。



Kali Purple 带来了 100 多个防御工具、文档、用于自动攻击脚本构建的 Kali CoPilot 以及更多工具。


Arkime - 完整的数据包捕获和分析

CyberChef - 网络瑞士军刀

Elastic Security - 安全信息和事件管理

GVM - 漏洞扫描器

TheHive - 事件响应平台

Malcolm - 网络流量分析工具套件

Suricata - 入侵检测系统

Zeek -（另一个）入侵检测系统


此外，为了与 美国《国家标准和技术研究所关键基础设施网络安全（NIST CSF）》的指导方针保持一致，为你配置了单独的菜单项目。它包括单独的应用类别 - 识别、保护、检测、响应和恢复。



此外，还为 Kali Purple 创建了一个单独的 Discord 频道，用于合作和为社区提供额外的帮助。

Python 中的 Pip 变化

Python 的 pip 命令在（即将发布的）Debian 12 Bookworm 版本中正在发生变化。pip 命令用于安装 Python 模块。由于这些模块是用 pip 从外部安装的，它可能会破坏现有的 Debian 系统。

因此，从 Debian 12 开始，如果你试图用 pip 安装任何模块，你应该会得到一个 “外部管理的环境externally-managed-environment”的错误。如下：



Kali Linux 团队从这个版本开始提供一个补丁，使你可以使用 pip 安装任何模块。但这只是暂时的解决方案，直到 Debian 12 稳定版。

所以，如果你是一个在 Kali Linux（或在 Debian）中使用 Python 环境的开发者，你肯定应该计划使用下面的 apt 命令来部署这些模块：

apt install python3-numpy


桌面环境和其他更新

默认桌面 Xfce 现在采用了 Xfce 4.18 版本，它带来了大量的功能，包括分割视图、图像预览和 Thunar 文件管理器中的其他功能。另外，KDE Plasma 版现在在 Kali Linux 2023.1 中的版本是 5.27。

Xfce 版的默认主题得到了改进，具有令人惊叹的外观；许多新的壁纸也包含在这个版本中。

最后，主线内核 6.1 现在可以在这个版本中使用，提供了最新的硬件、 CPU、GPU 和其他支持。

下载

如果你已经在运行 Kali Linux，只需运行系统升级就可以得到这个版本：

sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y


对于新的下载，请访问下面的页面来获取 ISO。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[just about 2 days ago, I was able to successfully install NixOS with the Arch Linux kernel, and I just have one thing to say. it's amazing. The reason I did this, was because the kernel that came with NixOS would cause screen tearing and crash my machine VERY often, as did many other operating systems. except for Arch Linux. I looked into the screen tearing and crash problems, and found that that can often be a result of problems with the kernel. so what did I do? I installed NixOS with the Arch Linux kernel. while it used to crash at least once every 2 hours, now that I've installed the arch Linux kernel on it, it hasn't crashed a single time, nor have I had any problems with screen tearing. Plus, another benefit is that I get to say this now: I use Arch LiNix BTW

CodeParrot automates API testing so developers can speed up release cycles and increase test coverage. It captures production traffic and database state to generate test cases that update with every release.
Here’s a short video that shows how it works: https://www.loom.com/share/dd6c12e23ceb43f587814a2fbc165c1f .
As managers of engineering teams (I was CTO of an ed-tech startup, Vedant was the founding engineer of a unicorn company) both of us faced challenges in enforcing high test coverage. We ended up relying a lot on manual testing but it became hard to scale, and led to reduced velocity and higher production bugs. This motivated us to build CodeParrot.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[北京时间3月10日晚间消息，据报道，亚马逊上个月公布的“重返办公室”政策遭遇重创。到目前为止，已有近3万名员工在一份内部请愿书签名反对。


亚马逊CEO安迪·贾西（Andy Jassy）2月17日曾宣布，从今年5月开始，公司将恢复到疫情之前的办公模式，大多数办公室员工每周至少要来办公室三次。


对于该决定，亚马逊员工表示不满。他们在企业即时通信软件Slack上组建了一个群组，宣传远程办公的优点，表达对新政策的担忧。同时，他们还起草了一份请愿书，呼吁亚马逊重新考虑该政策。


如今，已有29200名工在这份请愿书上签字，反对回归办公室的政策，约占亚马逊企业员工总数的10%。这表明，在经历了疫情导致的三年远程办公后，亚马逊强迫员工重回办公室略显草率。


在请愿书中，亚马逊员工列出了一些内部数据，以及员工们对这一政策的评论，以支持继续远程办公。


例如，去年的一项调查结果显示，87%的亚马逊员工更喜欢“每周一到两天，或更少的时间”在办公室工作。他们认为，远程办公在许多方面都胜过办公室工作，包括“集中注意力的能力”、“工作效率”和“创新/创造力”等。


员工们还表示，远程办公有利于更好地平衡工作与生活，能够节省通勤时间，让他们有时间照顾孩子，还能为气候变化做出一份贡献。


一些员工表示，由于亚马逊的这一新政策，他们将不得不开始寻找新工作。还有员工称，公司总是让我们拿出证据来支持工作中的一些想法，现在公司也应该看看员工们的数据（签名反对的人数）。

C but, increasingly, the environment in which those programs run differs
significantly from the C environment.  The BPF virtual machine and

莉娅·葛林菲尔德（LiahGreenfeld），美国波士顿大学社会学、政治学、人类学教授，民族主义研究领域最杰出的知名学者之一。为中国读者所知的其主要著作有：《民族主义：通往现代性的五条道路》《资本主义的精神：民族主义与经济增长》《民族主义与心智：现代文化论文集》等。其三卷本力作《心智、现代性和疯癫：文化对人类经验的影响》的中文版将于今年在国内面世。

一、科学和社会科学
不先理解什么是一般意义上的科学，就很难理解什么是社会科学，更无法对它进行评判。“科学”这个词本身并不能表达什么。迟至十八世纪，科学一直被当作是艺术的近义词，两者用于指代任何种类的知识；用来区分科学各学科和艺术各学科的标准或许是科学对现实的高度抽象。以此标准，艺术指的是如何做某事的实用知识，例如“爱之艺术”“政治的艺术”等等。而科学则指的是同一事物的理论知识，例如“爱的科学”和“政治的科学”。
然而，十七世纪现代物理学兴起之后，科学的内涵发生了巨大的变化，英语世界尤甚。今天，在知识的连续体（the knowledge continuum）中，科学占据了与艺术相对的另一极；艺术被认为是主观的，在自身创造的世界中自成一体；而科学则被认为是经验世界的知识体系，能够准确地反映经验世界。人们普遍认为科学是唯一可靠的，客观而权威。该术语含义的变化反映了科学作为一种新的社会制度出现了，它是特定的生活领域中某种既定的知行方式，它的组织方式令自己能够持续产生这种类型的知识。为了与过去那些从经验现实中产生客观知识的零星尝试相区别，今天的科学也被称为“现代科学”，这种科学制度的方向是理解经验现实。这一制度存在的前提预设是：经验世界是有序的，其秩序是可以了解的、且本身值得被了解。欧洲中世纪时，上帝被认为是唯一值得被了解的现实，自然就没人费心思去了解经验世界。因此，科学制度出现的前提条件是重新评价了世俗与超验的关…]]></summary>

 "An analysis of the National Institute of Standards and Technology’s National Vulnerability Database has shown that, if the number of vulnerabilities is any indication of exploitability, Windows 10 appears to be a lot safer than Android, Mac OS or Linux."
 Debian is a huge construct, and the vulnerabilities can spread across anything, 50 000 packages at least in Debian. Many desktops "in one" and so on. But why is Linux (the kernel) so high up on that vulnerability list? Windows 10 is less vulnerable? What is this? Some MS paid "research" by their terms? 
 An explanation would be much appreciated.

gpt-repository-loader as-is works pretty well in helping me achieve better responses. Eventually, I thought it would be cute to load itself into GPT-4 and have GPT-4 improve it. I was honestly surprised by PR#17. GPT-4 was able to write a valid an example repo and an expected output and throw in a small curveball by adjusting .gptignore. I did tell GPT the output file format in two places: 1.) in the preamble when I prompted it to make a PR for issue #16 and 2.) as a string in gpt_repository_loader.py, both of which are indirect ways to infer how to build a functional test. However, I don't think I explained to GPT in English anywhere on how .gptignore works at all!
I wonder how far GPT-4 can take this repo. Here is the process I'm following for developing:
- Open an issue describing the improvement to make
- Construct a prompt - start with using gpt_repository_loader.py on this repo to generate the repository context, then append the text of the opened issue after the --END-- line.
- Try not to edit any code GPT-4 generates. If there is something wrong, continue to prompt GPT to fix whatever it is.
- Create a feature branch on the issue and create a pull request based on GPT's response.
- Have a maintainer review, approve, and merge.
I am going to try to automate the steps above as much as possible. Really curious how tight the feedback loop will eventually get before something breaks!

信不信由你，《第二人生》一直在持续运行。现在它第一次来到了移动领域，事实上，这将是《第二人生》首次以任何形式扩展到 PC 之外。其背后的 Linden Lab 分享了一段介绍视频，并宣布移动应用程序的测试版将在今年某个时候推出。

Meta AI 创建了一个更大规模的预测蛋白质数据库

Meta 公司的研究部门 Meta AI 使用被称为 ESMFold 的新人工智能计算机程序创建了一个包含 6.17 亿个预测蛋白质的公共数据库。使用人工智能来预测蛋白质结构，不仅有望提高现有药物和候选药物的疗效，还有助于发现可以治疗那些一直无法治愈的疾病的分子。此前，Alphabet 的子公司 DeepMind 开发的 AlphaFold 的数据库有 2.14 亿个预测的蛋白质。Meta 公司称，ESMFold 比 AlphaFold 快 60 倍，但精确度较低。ESMFold 数据库更大，因为它是从以前没有研究过的基因序列中进行预测的。


消息来源：《华尔街日报》



老王点评：这是 AI 更严肃的场景，或许不如 ChatGPT 那样引人注目。




微软将 AI 助手加入其 Microsoft 365 中

微软今天宣布为其 Microsoft 365 应用程序和服务提供一个新的人工智能驱动的 Copilot 助手，旨在协助人们生成文档、电子邮件、演示文稿等等。Copilot 由 OpenAI 的 GPT-4 驱动，作为一个聊天机器人出现在侧边栏，允许 Office 用户召唤它来生成文档中的文本，根据 Word 文档创建 PowerPoint 演示文稿等。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Welp, whenever I see discussion about Gnome and KDE it basically comes down to "Gnome is simpler but KDE is more customizable". I tend to switch my DE/WM pretty frequently between Gnome, KDE and DWM (yeah, I'm a weirdo). And as much as I love all of them, I'm always amused by this paradox that despite of Gnome goal of being super simple DE, at the end of the night KDE is actually simpler in a lot of ways. Let's just compare setting your own keybinding in both DEs. In case of Gnome you just get a popup for a terminal command to put. In case of KDE you get a window, where you choose app and action. Next one, I had issues with drag'n'drop in file roller for a pretty long time in many distros few years back (Gnome 3 days). And when it finally worked, it's currently borked once again after Gnome 40 release. Never had such an issue, as borked basic functionality of their own app in KDE 5. And yet KDE manage that on top of their (also stupid simple) customizability. Even for the developers, Qt, at very least from my experience, manage to be simpler. Things like connecting phone via KDE connect or built in clipboard manager might be consider more of a feature, but that's yet another thing that kinda makes KDE simpler in some way, as it's more functional by default. And yet that's all, as I said earlier on top of not only stupid simple DE customization where you have built in downloader for themes, plasmoids and even SDDM themes but also very simple apps customization. So IMO - KDE is both simpler AND more customizable. But what Gnome's better at is workflow as their default is actually really, really great while in KDE in my experience you either use more or less windows-like workflow either end up with somewhat rough and unpolished state. What do you think about it?

 kNOME is not a "distro", a Desktop Environment, or anything even remotely official. It is just a bare-bones Debian installation using the GNOME desktop environment, where most GNOME apps have been replaced by KDE apps. It's been tweaked for privacy, aesthetics and functionality and burned to an ISO. It can be used in live mode or installed** to a disk. (see "INSTALLATION NOTES" below)
 kNOME is built on top of Debian Sid: the rolling, "unstable" branch of Debian. Why Sid, you ask? I got tired of Ubuntu derivatives a…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After a solid trial with linux for the last 5 months or so and i have concluded that I'm fed up with it.
 Half of the time i spend fidgeting with the settings rather than getting actual work done. I know that really this is my fault but I can't help but feel that the many errors and issues I've had with it amplify this. I just take twice as long to do something that should be a very simple task and it's always a little more time than windows to get stuff done.
 The breaking point was a couple of days ago where GRUB broke on me for the THIRD time and i wasn't able to recover it no matter how hard i tried. Ive never had to enter the BIOS more with any OS than with linux, and honestly I don't think it's even worth it anymore considering I've installed ghost spectre which runs on even less ram than my linux install, and takes all of the windows spyware out.
 I gave it a chance at least though!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[云无处不在，所以硬件比以往任何时候都更加关键。


我们很容易忘记技术人员所取得的进步。在 2000 年代初期，大多数本地用户组（LUG）定期举行安装节。那时，要配置一台机器来很好地运行 Linux，我们必须了解有关硬件的详细信息以及如何配置它。现在，将近二十年后，有了一个项目，其核心理想是让一台计算机运行 Linux 就像 API 调用一样简单。在这个新世界中，运维人员和开发者等不再需要担心服务器中的硬件。这种变化对下一代的运维人员和开发者产生了深远的影响。

在计算机技术的早期，你不得不经常接触硬件。如果计算机需要更多内存，你只需添加它即可。随着时间的推移，技术也有了很大的发展。这最终使运维人员远离硬件。过去需要去数据中心一趟，现在变成了远程操作硬件的支持工单。最终，硬件被完全摆脱了。相反，你现在可以通过简单的命令召唤和摧毁“服务器”，而不必再担心硬件问题。

这里是真正的真相：硬件的存在是因为需要它来为云提供动力。但是，云到底是什么？

为什么硬件对云至关重要

云是建立在利用抽象集中的基础资源之上的。它的范围可以从简单的在你的 家庭实验室 中运行几个虚拟机的管理程序，到复杂的包括定制服务器、网络设备、容器和从头开始设计的专注于规模效率的技术。

它们是模糊的。它们在进化。

今天那些进入技术领域的人没有那些更有经验的开发人员实践经验。许多人从最早与计算机交互时就接受过使用云的培训。他们不知道不用按钮来更改内存分配的世界。他们可以将注意力转移到技术栈的更高层次。然而，如果不了解他们所使用的基础架构所建立的基础，他们就会含蓄地放弃学习栈较低级别（包括硬件）的机会。这里没有说错，因为云基础设施的实施者和运维人员已经做出了特定的选择，有意让他们的产品更易于使用。

这意味着现在，你比以往任何时候都更需要有意识地考虑在选择使用云技术时你或其他人做出的权衡。大多数人在收到第一份超额的云账单或第一次因“吵闹的邻居”造成的中断之前，不会知道已经做出了哪些权衡。企业能否信任他们的供应商做出最适合他们运营的权衡？供应商会建议更有效或更有利可图的服务吗？让买家（或工程师！）当心。

有意识地考虑权衡取舍需要从多个角度审视你的要求和目标。基础设施决策和其中的权衡是该项目的整个过程、设计或使用模型所固有的。这就是为什么必须尽快计划它们的原因。必须考虑多种不同的路径，以便为你的项目找到一个合适的归宿。

首先是要实现的目标或提供的服务的轴心。这可能伴随着速度、质量或性能方面的要求。这本身可以驱动许多变量。你可能需要专用硬件（例如 GPU）才能以可接受的速度处理请求。此负载是否需要自动缩放？当然，这些路径是交织在一起的。问题已经跳转到“我的钱包会自动缩放吗？”

业务需求是要考虑的另一部分。你的项目可能有特定的安全或合规性要求，这些要求规定了数据的存储位置。邻近相关服务也是一个潜在的问题。这包括确保与附近证券交易所的 低延迟连接 或能够提供高质量的本地视频缓存作为内容交付网络（CDN）的一部分。

然后是最后一部分，即所提供服务的价值和成本：一个人希望或可以花多少钱来满足要求。这与第一条路径紧密相关。你的业务是“什么”以及你的业务“如何”运作。这可以像你的企业更喜欢资本支出还是更喜欢运营支出一样普通。

当看到这些选项时，很容易看到改变任何一个变量都会开始改变其他变量。它们在本质上是相互交织的，一些技术可能允许这些变量动态变化。如果不了解较低层次的底层，你就有可能采取推动这种动态计费模式的路径。对一些人来说，这是首选。对其他人来说，这可能是令人恐惧的。

尽管在现代技术栈中，学习特定的硬件知识已变得更加可有可无，但我们希望这篇文章能鼓励你去研究你可能在不知不觉中错过的东西。硬件的改进是功能交付和效率提高的一个重要部分，将计算机从房间大小的怪物缩小到小到可以植入人体内。我们希望你花时间停下来，学习并考虑你的下一个项目将在什么硬件平台上运行，即使你不控制它。

如果你是一个还没有把头从云端拿出来的学生，去找一台 旧电脑，安装一根内存，挑战自己，学习新东西。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[如果你想通过非代码贡献成为一个提交者，或者没有时间做代码贡献，那么第一步就是加入社区。


对于不同的人来说，开源“社区”意味着不同的东西。我认为开源有点像“爱情”，因为它是关于人和关系的。把开源当作一个社区，因为没有人，就没有源代码，无论是开源还是闭源。

我是 Apache DolphinScheduler 社区的成员。由于该项目有意保持低代码，因此它吸引了许多 非软件开发人员。有时，那些不编写代码的人不确定是否有一种有意义的方式来为主要由源代码组成的开源项目做出贡献。我的经验告诉我，有，我将在本文中解释原因。

向社区做出贡献

在 Apache DolphinScheduler 项目中，我主要负责全球运营、影响力和社区关怀。

一些人会说项目是树而开源是土壤。这是一个恰当的比喻，它说明了积极培育你想要帮助成长的东西的重要性。

我有一个更简单的想法：尽一切可能使其变得更好。

一个社区需要不断的关注，不是因为它很贪心，而是因为它是生活的一部分。社区是你身边的人，无论是物理空间还是在线空间。

自从加入开源社区以来，我已经独立发起并组织了一些活动，包括：


平均每月在中国举办一次会议。

建议社区参与大数据领域内的技术分享。

协调了中国“大数据”领域几乎所有的开源项目，与这些社区进行了个别访问和交流。


在我看来，一个优秀的项目应该在一个良好的生态系统中成长。社区需要走出去，交换想法，分享资源，并与其他优秀的社区合作。每个人都应该感受到社区在工作中带来的好处。

我的海外扩张遵循相同的模式。当然，由于文化和语言的差异，这样做很困难。这需要耗费精力，但这是值得的。

到目前为止，我们已经在包括美国、印度、新加坡、德国、法国、芬兰等国家成功举办了会议。

Docker 要求以“组织”名义开设账号的用户升级到付费的团队方案，每年 420 美元，否则其账号将被删除，其名下的 Docker 镜像也将被删除。Docker Hub 被很多开源项目用于发布镜像，许多项目依赖于这些免费的镜像，如果这些镜像被删除，意味这些免费用户的系统会崩溃。Docker 的 CTO 甚至说他们“将关闭那些不交钱的账户，并且不允许其他人接管这个名字”。此举引发了巨大争议，很多人开始将其镜像迁移出 Docker 转到其它平台或自行托管。

AI 棋手刺激人类棋手进步

根据一项研究，在 DeepMind 的 AlphaGo 击败最强大的人类棋手之后，人类棋手通过与 AI 棋手对弈而取得了显著进步。研究人员使用了一种被称为“决策质量指数”（DQI）的指标，该指标用于评估一步棋的质量，如果没有尝试与之前的动作相结合，即认为一个动作是“新颖的”。分析发现，1950 年至 2015 年间，围棋水平的改善相对较小，年度 DQI 中值在 -0.2 至 0.2 之间波动。而在 2016 年后，DQI 跃升，2018 年至 2021 年间的中值超过 0.7。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There is plenty of networking libraries, but they hardly benefit from the newest and most remarkable features in the Linux kernel. Since kernel 5.19, several new io_uring calls are available to those avoiding system calls on the hot paths. We combined that with a bunch of SIMD-accelerated libraries and applied it to the most straightforward RPC protocol out there, open-sourcing a backend library for C and Python. The results are ridiculous, being much faster than gRPC and up to 100x faster than Python-native FastAPI, even with a single-threaded UJRPC server.
  
 Setup 🔁 Server Latency w 1 client Throughput w 32 clients 
  
 Fast API over REST ❌ 🐍 1'203 μs 3'184 rps 
  Fast API over WebSocket ✅ 🐍 86 μs 11'356 rps ¹ 
  gRPC ² ✅ 🐍 164 μs 9'849 rps 
       
  UJRPC with POSIX ❌ C 62 μs 79'000 rps 
  UJRPC with io_uring ✅ 🐍 23 μs 43'000 rps 
  UJRPC with io_uring ✅ C 22 μs 231'000 rps 
 
 We invite everyone to check out our sources on GitHub and use UJRPC in your next application!
  
PS: We have a few more crazy Linux-oriented projects in our GitHub Unum-Cloud organization and we would appreciate a 🌟 😉

阅读法国著名作家、思想家埃德蒙·雅贝斯（Edmond Jabès，1912-1991）的《问题之书》（原书名: Le Livre des questions，1963-1873；刘楠祺译，广西师范大学出版社，2020年12月），本身就是一个问题：上下两卷共一千多页的厚重之书，一部跨学科、跨文本、无中心、无边界、不属于任何文类但却包罗各种文类、词语在发声与沉默之间奔突、 页面上的印刷符号在虚空与紧密之间随意分布的文本，应该以什么方式打开？作者究竟是在对话还是自语？读起来究竟是话题太沉重还是思绪太轻盈？实际上还要考虑到在作者前后十余年的写作中，这部《问题之书》分五本先后出版，是前后总共十五卷的雅贝斯“问题之书系列”的前七卷，了解原书的这一写作与出版情况有助于我们以一种始终是流动的、不断完成和生长的目光来进入阅读。
“如何阅读”本来不是什么问题，想怎么读就怎么读，但是这部“问题之书”确实首先会让读者思考“读”这个问题。美国诗人保罗·奥斯特（Paul Auster）1992年在其随笔集《饥饿的艺术》（L'Art de lafaim）中这样评价雅贝斯的独特文体：“既非小说，也非诗歌，既非文论，又非戏剧，但又是所有这些形式的混合体；文本自身作为一个整体，无尽地游移于人物和对话之间，在情感充溢的抒情、散文体的评论以及歌谣和格言间穿梭，好似整个文本系由各种碎片拼接而成，却又不时地回归到作者提出的中心问题上来，即如何言说不可言说者。这个问题，既是犹太人的燔祭，也是文学本身。雅贝斯以其傲人的想象力纵身一跃，令二者珠联璧合。”（《问题之书》下册，译后记，527页）话说得已经比较明白。但是读进去很快就会发现遇到的还不仅仅是作者的独特文体、文风问题，而是更有某种属…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[大江健三郎（1935.1.31－2023.3.3）

2023年3月3日，日本作家大江健三郎先生离开了这个世界。
大江先生不仅仅是日本第二位诺奖作家，或许也是“大写”的文学在日本最后的代表。这不是说在他之后再无杰出的作家，而是指“文学”本身在社会中的位置已经变了。读者不再有兴趣从几行字、几页纸里寻求整个地球的重量，作者也不再试图以几段故事、几个形象来通向全部历史的总体。这样的事业对人对己都是不折不扣的苦行。大江先生也许是日本最后一名坚定的苦行者。他的离去意味着什么，对每个关心日本文学现状的人，都是不得不思考的问题。尽管大江先生的毕生事业绝非三言两语可以概括，但作为一名从他的著作中受益良多的读者，我感到有义务在自己的脑海中试着勾勒这位大作家的“全体像”，以完成某种私人化的悼念。这样的描绘注定挂一漏万，不过或许可以成为对作家本人的文学方法的致敬。因为大江先生自己的创作中始终流露出这样一种信念：即使是最微小、最偶然、最琐碎的事物，也可以借助想象力的飞跃通向世界的“全体”。
在1969年与作家高桥和巳的一次对谈中，大江先生提到，他的小说构思往往始于一个极度鲜明而并无确定意义的形象，继而像滚雪球一般膨胀起来。例如，最开始他心中可能只有这样一个场景：一个肥胖的男人，深夜在卧室里啃食油腻的猪蹄。而在建构自己心中的大江先生的“全体像”时，我不期然地遇到了一个同样强烈鲜明的印象，它来自小说《被偷换的孩子》：一个刚刚步入老年的男人，身材矮小但双肩颇宽，由于坚持体育锻炼，臂膀上的肌肉仍然结实——这男人蹲在厨房的地面上，艰难地宰杀一只硕大的甲鱼。由于未曾亲眼见过大江先生，每次想象他的面貌时，我的思绪都会回到这个奇怪的原点。正如大江先生后期的许多其他作品一样，这部小说的主人公也是“长江古义人”，他身上带有作家本人的影子。但是，这个场面之所以令人难以忘怀，毋宁说是由于作者的灵魂似乎在此分裂开来，一半在…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[如果你打算把 Arch Linux 作为日常用机，你应该考虑一下 Arch Linux 与其他发行版的不同优点。下面是一个快速比较。


如果你考虑改用 Linux，你会接触到数百个 Linux 发行版。每个 Linux 发行版都有其独特的功能、优势和劣势。

它们为用户提供了独特的功能、工具和界面的选择，以满足不同的需求。如果你想和 Arch Linux 进行比较，选择合适的 Linux 发行版，这可能会让人不知所措。

在这篇文章中，我将重点介绍 Arch Linux，它是最受欢迎的 Linux 发行版之一，并将它与其他流行的 Linux 发行版进行比较。

关于 Arch Linux 的一些说明

Arch Linux 是一个轻量级和高度可定制的 Linux 发行版，最初发布于 2002 年。与其他流行的发行版不同，Arch Linux 是一个简约的发行版，采用自己动手（DIY）的方式。它是为中高级 Linux 用户设计的，他们喜欢控制和灵活性而不是易用性。

Arch Linux 遵循滚动发布模式，这意味着你可以经常用最新的软件包更新你的系统。

Arch Linux 的优点

Arch Linux 有很多优点。然而，一个发行版到底好不好取决于你的使用情况或品味。这因人而异。但在我看来，Arch Linux 比其他 Linux 发行版有几个优势，比如：


轻量级和快速（原装版的 Arch，尤其是带有 Xfce 桌面的）

灵活性和定制化

最新的软件包

可靠和稳定（如果正确使用和维护的话）

通过 Arch 用户仓库Arch User Repository（AUR）收集最广泛的软件包

通过测试软件仓库和安装提供开发包


现在，让我们简单了解一下主要和流行的 Linux 发行版。

其他主要发行版的简要概述

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I was thinking of a long term project for a distribution with the aim of appealing to the desktop/home user/regular consumer…
 Yes, inspired by proprietary OSes like Windows and macOS, but without copying them. 
 To achieve that, it would have the following characteristics:
  
A premium look and feel (which also means great UX design), BY DEFAULT —no need to download extra themes or whatever— the OS would always look great from the start and be a bliss to daily drive… The OS would have its own unique visual identity which would separate it from all other desktop distros.
 
Stable and functional…
 
No need to ever use the terminal/CLI, everything would be automated.
 
Fixed release, having a new version every year, each release would be supported for a total of 5 years. 
 
 Price for the User: $0
 With the emphasis on looking good to appeal to the regular consumer/prosumer which then would increase usage, which would then attract companies like Adobe and others to develop their tools for it…
 It would have all codecs needed for media playback…
 I am sure I am not the first to think of something like this. My aim is to make this Linux distribution a product many users will want to download and use, and for everyone, not just a specific niche. 
 Buuuut… how feasible would that be? Would any of you use something like this?

Them and Google with ChromeOS, if you count it as Linux. But, I haven't been able to find any articles or anything of him expressing his opinion on the Deck or on Valve.

We abstract over archaic APIs and merge them into a single modern API for the real estate industry, giving companies access to multiple property management systems (PMSs) via a REST API.  Think merge.dev or Plaid for real estate.
Property managers nowadays use software to operate residential rental properties. Our customers are not these property managers directly, but companies who provide services to both property managers and renters.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[在这篇文章中，我们将逐步介绍如何在 RHEL 8、Rocky Linux 8 或 AlmaLinux 8 上安装 MiniKube。


MiniKube 是一个跨平台的开源工具，可以让你在本地机器上部署单节点 Kubernetes 集群。

Kubernetes，也被称为 k8s，或简称 Kube，是一个开源的容器编排平台，用于容器的自动化扩展和部署。MiniKube 集群帮助开发人员和管理员在集群中构建他们的测试环境。

MiniKube 的先决条件


最小化安装的 RHEL 8 或 Rocky Linux 8 或 AlmaLinux 8

本地配置的 RHEL 8 仓库或订阅

至少 2GB RAM 和 2 个 vCPU

20GB 硬盘空间

具有管理员身份的 sudo 用户

稳定的互联网连接

Docker 或虚拟机管理器，如 VirtualBox、KVM 和 VMware 等


在这篇文章中，我们将使用 Docker 作为 MiniKube 的驱动程序。满足所有先决条件后，现在是时候卷起袖子动手了。

步骤 1）启用官方 Docker 仓库

要启用 Docker 官方仓库，运行：

$ sudo dnf config-manager --add-repo=https://download.docker.com/linux/centos/docker-ce.repo
$ sudo dnf repolist




步骤 2）安装 Docker CE（社区版）

运行以下 dnf 命令来安装 Docker 及其依赖项：

$ sudo dnf install docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io -y


输出：

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[OpenAI 宣布 GPT-4，事实性评估得分提高 40%

正如上周微软德国 CTO 披露 的那样，OpenAI 今天发布了 GPT-4。它与 GPT-3 的一个主要区别是它是一个大型多模态模型，而不是大型语言模型，它的输入输出不再局限于文本，可以是图像和视频。GPT-4 的参数数量未知，可能会比 GPT-3 的 1750 亿个参数要多，但其数据训练集仍然停留在 2021 年 9 月。OpenAI 称，当任务的复杂性达到足够的阈值，GPT-4 优势就会非常明显，在测试中的表现远胜于前代。OpenAI 称它在律师考试中的得分能进入前 10%；在生物奥林匹克竞赛和 GRE 写作中能接近满分，不过在有的测试中结果并不好，比如在 AP 英语语言和写作中的得分只有 2 分。目前 GPT-4 还没有开放公众使用。


消息来源：The Register



老王点评：都听说了吧，今天 GPT-4 的消息已经刷屏。它和一些 AI 的区别就像是鸥翼门的 Model X 和垃圾箱的区别。




Kali Linux 发布防御安全发行版 Purple

用于渗透测试、安全审计和网络安全研究的发行版 Kali Linux 项目发布了一个专门用于防御的版本 Kali Purple。开发者表示这代表着一个新的时代，Kali 不再是进攻用，它还能防御了。Kali Purple 提供了逾百种安全防御工具。


消息来源：Kali



老王点评：这让我想起来一个古老的成语“自相矛盾”，到底是矛锋利呢，还是盾坚固呢？




经过近二十年的等待，GNOME 44 带来了图片缩略图

GNOME 44 发布了候选发布版，预计将出现在即将发布的 Ubuntu 23.04 和 Fedora 38 中。除了从 GTK3 迁移到 GTK4 之外，它还支持 Wayland 的针对每个显示器设置不同的缩放比例，仅此一项就可以让用户从 X11 切换到 Wayland。除了新功能之外，GNOME 44 还恢复了一些从旧版本中删除的功能，其中一些是用户已经要求了很久的。比如恢复了 GNOME 43 中删除的文件夹展开，因为文件应用的侧边栏中没有树状视图，它曾经有一个，但多年前就被删除了。甚至还恢复了 2004 年就要求的图像文件的缩略图预览。


消息来源：The Register



老王点评：看起来 GNOME 更重视用户的呼声了。]]></summary>

如果你对把数据提交给公司控制的云服务持谨慎态度，但同时又喜欢远程存储的便利性和基于 Web 的轻松访问，那么不止你是这样。云端因其广泛的功能而广受欢迎。但是 云端服务不一定是封闭的。幸运的是，开源项目 Nextcloud 提供了个人和私有的云应用程序套件。

安装 和导入数据很容易 —— 包括通讯录、日历和照片。真正难办的是从 iCloud 等云提供商那里获取数据。在本文中，我将告诉你把自己的数据迁移到 Nextcloud 需要采取的步骤。

把你的数据迁移至 Nextcloud

和在 安卓设备 上一样，首先你必须将现有数据从苹果的 iCloud 传输到 Nextcloud。然后，你可以为你的苹果设备设置两个新帐户，以完全自动同步通讯录和预约。苹果支持用于日历同步的 CalDAV 和用于通讯录同步的 CardDAV 开放协议，因此你甚至不需要安装额外的应用。

要导出你的通讯录，你可以在 iPhone 或者 iPad 上打开 “通讯录Contacts” 应用或在网络浏览器中登录 iCloud：


选择要传输到 Nextcloud 的所有地址簿条目，然后选择 “文件File > 输出Export > 输出 vCardExport vCard” 以在本地磁盘上保存 .vcf 文件。

将 .vcf 文件导入 Nextcloud。为此，请选择 “通讯录Contacts” 应用，点击左下角的 “设置Settings” 并选择 “导入通讯录Import contacts” 按钮。 在接下来的对话窗口中，点击 “选择本地文件Select local file”，然后打开之前保存的 vCard。


要在你的 iPhone 或 iPad 上设置 CardDAV 帐户，请转至 “设置Settin…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The kernel thread “netns” is based on a single threaded workqueue (https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v6.2-rc4/source/net/core/net_namespace.c#L1106), which is created when the network namespace is initialized (net_ns_init()). If you want to read more about “network namespaces” you can use the following link https://medium.com/@boutnaru/linux-namespaces-network-namespace-part-3-7f8f8e06fef3. Also, for a reminder you can also check out the diagram below (https://wizardzines.com/comics/network-namespaces/). 
 “netns” is responsible for cleaning up network namespaces. When a namespace is destroyed the kernel adds it to a cleanup list. The kernel thread “netns” goes over the list and performs the cleanup process using the “cleanup_net()” function (https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v6.2.3/source/net/core/net_namespace.c#L565). 
 If you want to see where all the magic happens is in “__put_net()” which queues the work on the “netns” to execute “cleanup_net()” function (https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v6.2-rc4/source/net/core/net_namespace.c#L649).

笔者从事的是人文艺术学科的教学与研究工作，于此类高新科技完全是门外汉，毫无发言权，只能“敬谢不敏”。不过，ChatGPT之剽悍强大，绝不止影响科技领域，而是辐射了几乎全世界，各行各业莫不受其巨浪冲击。从某种意义上说，每个人都是当局者，皆不能袖手旁观。
ChatGPT如何改变世界，笔者不敢断言。但是不同行业的从业者，似乎都在尝试利用这一利器，做各种“好玩”的事，如答数理化题、写电子代码、学习语言、代写文案、翻译小说、创作音乐、预言未来……竞相测试其灵敏度、智慧度、完成度、先进度。以我从事的学科而言，就有好事者问了ChatGPT，请它模仿大诗人杜甫作诗，据《我们请ChatGPT模仿杜甫写了一首诗》，提问者说：“杜甫与成都的渊源很深，你能假装你是杜甫，为成都写一首诗吗？”ChatGPT作出的诗“画风”是这样的：
重阳节，成都繁华，锦绣城市，灯火通明。城中人来往，赏菊花红，饮酒唱歌，欢度佳节。山川秀丽，水草青青，四面山水，环抱四方。江河清澈，云霞缤纷，成都在此，盛世如画。城市明朗，人民热爱，努力拼搏，创造美好。愿成都永远，繁华富强，国泰民安，永久安康。
平心而论，这所谓的“诗”非常小儿科，可以说既无诗的章法，更与杜甫毫不沾边。如果我一眼看到，或许会猜测是作文水平较好的小学生的习作。当然，作出这样不成器的“伪杜诗”，ChatGPT是有解释的：“对不起，作为一个AI，我可能不能完全模仿杜甫的诗风，但是我会尽力试着去写一首符合杜甫诗风的…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[你可能已经了解过轻量级标记语言 Markdown。如果你是第一次接触这个概念，请参考我们的 Markdown 指南。概括来讲，它是一种用于创建纯文本文档的简单又高效的语言。

然而，Markdown 在制作详细的报告或技术文件方面可能还不够完善。

受益于 knitr 和 Pandoc 等软件包，交互式文件格式 R Markdown 早在 2014 年就出现了。它将纯文本与内嵌的 R 代码相结合，可以制作动态文件。

你可以使用 各种 IDE 和扩展来创建 R Markdown 文档，官方 IDE 为 RStudio。因此，在这篇文章中，我们将重点介绍使用 RStudio 学习 R Markdown 语法。


💡（假如你没有了解过，）R 编程语言 是一种用于统计计算、图形表示和报告的语言。


配置 RStudio

通过合适的配置，你可以很轻松地用 RStudio 来编写 R Markdown。只需要安装一个软件包，就已经完成了大部分的工作！

安装 RStudio 后，在 “工具Tools” 菜单中选择 “安装软件包Install Packages” 选项。



在弹出的对话框中，搜索 “rmarkdown” 并安装。




💡 如果你想使用类似 Python 的代码块，你需要安装额外的包。当你想在你的文档中包含这些包时，RStudio 会提示你安装所需的包。


安装完成后，你可以通过选择 “文件File > 新建文件New File > R Markdown” 来新建一个 R Markdown 文档。



之后会提示你添加一些关于文件的信息（文件的元数据），把这些填上就可以了。



或者你可以创建一个空的文件从零开始。

Fully homomorphic encryption (FHE) enables computation on encrypted data. This is essentially the ultimate privacy guarantee - a server that does work for its users (like fetching emails, tweets, or search results), without ever knowing what its users are doing - who they talk to, who they follow, or even what they search for. Servers using FHE give you cryptographic proof that they aren’t spying on you.
Unfortunately, performing general computation using FHE is notoriously slow. We have focused on solving a simple, specific problem: retrieve an item from a key-value store, without revealing to the server whic…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello HN! We’re Max and Lydia, co-founders at CodeComplete AI (https://codecomplete.ai), an AI-powered coding assistant for enterprise companies. Many large companies can’t use products like GitHub Copilot because of the security and privacy risks, so we’re building a self-hosted version that’s fine tuned to the company’s codebase.
We love Copilot and believe that AI will change the way developers work. Max wanted to use Copilot when he was an ML engineer at Meta, but leadership blocked him because Copilot requires sending company code to GitHub and OpenAI. We built CodeComplete because lots of other companies are in the same boat, and we want to offer a secure way for these companies to leverage the latest AI-powered dev tools.
To that end, our product is really meant for large engineerin…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Writing applications for devices with a lot of resource constraints,
such as a 
small amount of RAM or no memory-management unit (MMU), poses some
challenges. Running a Linux distribution often isn't an option on these devices,
but there are operating systems that try to bridge the gap between running
a Linux distribution and using bare-metal development. One of these is Zephyr, a real-time operating system
(RTOS) launched by the Linux Foundation in
2016. LWN looked in on Zephyr at its four-year
anniversary as well. Seven years after its announcement, Zephyr 
has made lots of progress and now has an active ecosystem surrounding it.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So...say what you will about the open source office software such as Google Docs, Libre, OpenOffice. Well they can cover a vast majority of the bases...Microsoft Office is a superior product. This is coming from someone that daily uses Libre + Thunderbird. However Microsoft Office is a better product, it just is. And to be honest the other office software competitors simply don't have the capital to compete at the level Microsoft does. Microsoft MAKES HUGE SUMS OF money off businesses who employ Microsoft Office and as a result they invest A LOT OF MONEY into the product, and well it shows.
 Next lets face the reality, Linux maintains a 2.94% market share of the Desktop Operating system marketshare...its tiny (although it used to be smaller)
 So here's my idea
 Steam/Value have DONE AN AMAZING job with Proton. I can play games like GTAV, RDR2, War Thunder, MTW2, Etc, etc, etc. What if Microsoft went to them and said "Hey, if you want to try and natively support Microsoft Office on Linux we will sign a licensing deal with you"
 Microsoft gives Steam/Value what they need to attempt the project. Obviously NDAs are going be involved cause I'm confident Microsoft does not want its source code in the open. If Steam/Value can come up with an acceptable solution they can retail it and Microsft gets a % of the sales.
 Why do I target Value/Steam? Because they have already implemented a lot of software that used to be only able to "natively" run on Linux in a very seamless manner.
 By natively I mean as close as possible, where all (or at least 99.9%) of them work flawlessly. 
 Am I crazy?

 I'd really like some help in understanding Wayland vs. X.org. I know Wayland is a protocol, so to be able to do antyhing with it, you'll still need a server, display manager, window manager, and so on. (Which could, if you wanted to, all be one program).
 Recently I've tried switching to KDE's Wayland session. It worked, except for the fact that Solaar (Logitech MX Master 3 mouse control panel) doesn't seem to work with Wayland (yet), and the KDE keybinding settings screen also doesn't function (yet; it isn't there when you're logged into an X session).
 That aside, what I don't understand is: what is the system actually running on? Wayland is just the protocol. What video drivers is the system using, and what is the graphics server and/or display manager? When running Wayland somewhere down the line and everything works correctly, would I be able to completely remove X.org?

之前，我们在 #934 中报道过，有人通过 BT 种子泄露了 Meta 的大语言模型 LLaMA 的权重，即存储在神经网络中的训练“知识”。随后，围绕着 LLaMA 的发展出现了爆炸性的增长，开源社区迅速对 LLaMA 进行了优化和开发，使其能运行在普通人能使用的硬件上。3 月 11 日，能运行在 M1 Mac 的版本 llama.cpp 出现；随后几天，人们在 Windows、Pixel 6 手机、树莓派 4 上成功运行了它，而且效果令人满意。


消息来源：Ars Technica



老王点评：这真正体现了开源力量！往往是专有软件开辟方向，开源软件迅速引爆它。




WordPress 拥抱去中心化社交网络

WordPress 和 Tumblr 等服务的母公司 Automattic 收购了 ActivityPub for WordPress 插件，并招募了该插件的开发者。ActivityPub 是一个开放去中心化社交网络协议，被 Mastodon、PeerTube 等应用使用。该插件允许其他联邦平台的用户订阅 WordPress 博客，在联邦平台上发布的评论会成为博文的评论。除了 ActivityPub 协议，该公司还在测试其它去中心化社交协议，如支持 Nostr 和 Bluesky 的 AT 协议。


消息来源：Tech Crunch



老王点评：以 WordPress 所占据的 40% 的全球网站份额来说，这对去中心化网络很有推动作用。




Meta 停止对 NFT 的支持

Meta 发布消息称，该公司将关闭 Instagram 和 Facebook 上的 NFT 功能。这一功能去年 5 月才开始在特定的 Instagram 创作者中测试，6 月又有一些 Facebook 用户参与测试。到 7 月，Instagram 上为 100 个国家的创作者扩大了 NFT 支持。Meta 表示它正在将其投资从 NFT 转向 Meta Pay 等产品，以及使创作者能够直接在 Meta 平台上赚钱的功能。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Windows 有其著名的任务管理器。Linux 有几个 GUI 和 命令行的系统监视器。每个 Linux 系统都都有几个这样的监视器。

在命令行中，top 命令可能是用于快速检查系统资源使用情况的最佳命令。

除了查看进程之外，使用 top 命令 可能会很麻烦。而这就是 htop 的优势所在。抛开双关语不谈，htop 是一个类似于 top 的实用程序，但具有更好的、用户友好的界面。

在本指南中，我将向你展示如何在 Linux 中安装和使用 htop。

在 Linux 中安装 htop 实用程序

在大多数的 Linux 发行版中你不会找到预安装的 htop，但作为最流行的实用程序之一，你会在几乎每个 Linux 发行版的默认存储库中找到 htop。

因此，如果你的机器是基于 Debian/Ubuntu 驱动的，则以下命令应该可以完成你的工作：

sudo apt install htop


类似的，如果你使用的是 Fedora，则可以使用以下的命令：

sudo dnf install htop


如果你想避免从源代码构建包，还有一个 Snap 包可用：

sudo snap install htop


如果你使用的是其它的发行版或者想从源代码构建，你可以随时参考 htop 的 GitHub 页面以获得详细说明。

完成安装后，你只需在终端中使用 htop 命令，它将反映系统中所有正在运行的进程：

htop




在 htop 中，每个部分都使用颜色标识，所以让我们看看使用 htop 时每种颜色表示什么。

htop 中不同的颜色和统计信息表示什么

让我们从 CPU 使用率栏开始，因为它使用的颜色最缤纷多彩。

绿色：用户进程消耗的资源。

蓝色：表示低优先级线程。

在使用 NixOS 几天之前，我经常想知道同样的事情。

当我意识到这些好处后，我就写了这篇文章来帮助你了解 为什么你要考虑使用 NixOS。如果你已经阅读了本系列的第一篇文章，那么你已经知道自己想要什么了。

那么，如何开始呢？考虑到它对许多人来说可能是一种新体验，你应该用它替换日常使用的系统还是将其安装为虚拟机？

我建议在你想要将其替换为你的主要操作系统之前在虚拟机上使用 NixOS。这适用于你想尝试的任何新事物，特别是 先进的 Linux 发行版，例如 NixOS。

使用 VirtualBox 在 VM 中安装 NixOS

在本教程中，我将使用 VirtualBox。

如果你使用的是 Ubuntu 并且不关心是否拥有最新版本，那么可以使用一个命令安装 VirtualBox：

sudo apt install virtualbox


想要安装最新版本？你可以参考下面的指南：


如何在 Ubuntu 上安装 VirtualBox（初学者教程）


如果你使用 Ubuntu 以外的任何发行版，你可以 按照其官方下载页面的下载说明进行操作。

成功安装 VirtualBox 后，让我们从第一步开始。

步骤 1：获 取NixOS 的 ISO 镜像

你需要前往 NixOS 官方下载页面。

在 “NixOS: the Linux distribution” 部分，你会找到带有 GNOME 和 KDE 桌面的 ISO。

当然，也有最小化 ISO，但我建议使用两者之一（GNOME 和 KDE）：



对于本教程，我将使用 GNOME。

请记住，你可以选择 GNOME 和 KDE 两种立付桌面环境Live Desktop。

像我这样的年龄、经历和阅历，被一本书绊住的概率很低，除非这书的学术内涵足够新颖，并且有趣。
《漫长的余生》（下称《余生》）讲述了一个北魏宫女的故事，反衬出一个动乱时代的历史画卷。做过“二十世纪妇女口述史”，我这里不缺女人的故事；“千年未有之大变局”身在其中，无需史料旁征佐证；无论王钟儿的坎坷人生还是她身处的时代，都不是我关注的要点。让我滞留在这里的，不是具体的历史场景，而是场景幕后的推手暨该书作者的良苦用心：螺蛳壳里“筑”道场——我用“筑”取代“做”，是想强调：此书讲述的不只一个人的生命故事，铺展的也不是一次性终结的举事道场，罗新将他多年力倡的新史观有效地推进到实践层面，身体力行地筑起了一个可做示范的平台，为后学跟进提供了难得的范例。
当下，微观史风行。微观史学的历史不长，至今不过半个世纪，在中国大陆近年有爆发的趋势。微观史的出现基于目光向下的政治理念，对传统史学的宏大叙事是挑战也是补充；但它的史学抱负与传统史学是一致的：将“微小”宏大化，在史料分析的基础上试图让一滴水珠“变成一个小小的世界”（[法]勒华拉杜里《蒙塔尤》），依旧是在传统的史学观念中做文章。表面看，《余生》很像一部本土化的微观史，其故事来源基于一方女性墓志铭，不仅主人公微小如尘，细节分析也如剥茧抽丝，说“微”是恰如其分的。但这不是一部微观史，它的分析框架不在时下盛行的微观史套路中，没有以小人物做大历史的僭越心态，也不见“滴水见海洋”的史学抱负。相反，它的目光是平视的，叙事路径因此可以在广阔的历史画卷上从容而平缓地徐徐展开。

记载王钟儿生平的《魏故比丘尼统慈庆墓志铭》

确切地说，这是一部面目全新的史学著作，将（一个）“人”的生命故事嵌入世间生活的历史肌理之中，在新史观的光照下做一次新的尝试。其…]]></summary>

the 1.0 kernel release, but it implements a design seen in systems that were
already old when Linux was born.  For much of that time, softirqs have been
an impediment to the kernel community's scalability and response-time
goals, but they have proved resistant to removal.  A recent discussion on a
proposed new heuristic to mitigate a softirq-related performance problem
may have reinvigorated interest in doing something about this subsystem

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[社区开发预装 Flatpak 而不是 Snap 的 Ubuntu 特色版

在 Canonical 宣布未来的 Ubuntu 发行版及其特色版默认 不包括 Flatpak 支持之后，有人制作了一个非官方的 Ubuntu 特色版 Ubuntu Flatpak Remix。它移除了 Snap 应用支持，而预装了 Flatpak 应用支持。这包括几个关键的应用程序，如 Firefox、Thunderbird 和 LibreOffice 等。此外，你还可以从 Flathub 安装更多的 Flatpak 应用。


消息来源：9to5linux



老王点评：这就是社区的价值，看看会有多少人去选择 Flatpak 特色版的 Ubuntu。




调查发现：开源是最值得信任的技术

Stack Overflow 调查了数千名开发人员发现，开源（6.9）、云计算（6.5）和机器学习（5.9）是最值得信任的技术，而得分最低的是量子计算（3.7）、纳米技术（4.5）、低代码/无代码（4.6）。在评价技术对世界的影响时，正面平均得分最高的技术是开源技术（7.2）、可持续技术（6.6）和机器学习（6.5）；负面平均得分最高的技术是低代码/无代码、内源和区块链，均为 5.3分。


消息来源：Stack Overflow



老王点评：开源得到信任果然已经是共识了。




GitHub 要求更多开发者使用 2FA

GitHub 将从 3 月 13 日起要求更多账户启用双因素认证（2FA）。到 2023 年底，这一规定将扩大到所有在 GitHub 上贡献代码的开发者。在该要求生效前 45 天，这些用户会在产品内和通过电子邮件收到定期提醒。如果在截止日期的七天后仍然没有这样做，他们将无法访问 GitHub 的大部分功能。在过去几个月里，GitHub 一直在逐步向特定类型的用户推出这一要求。GitHub 称，它之所以这样做，是因为 GitHub 是软件供应链的一个重要组成部分，而现在只有大约 16.5% 的 GitHub 活跃用户使用 2FA。


消息来源：Ars Technica



老王点评：这应该是一种有效提高软件供应链安全的方式，其实并不麻烦。]]></summary>

《童年往事》里，阿孝咕跟着父母到了台湾，太阳一直高悬，时光一路蝉鸣，父母是时代的泪滴，孩子却野生芭乐一样成长。打架，撒谎，梦遗，考试，恋爱。榻榻米上，蚂蚁爬上祖母的身体，不肖子孙才发现，祖母已经去世很久很久。
写了很久很久，普鲁斯特终于在《追忆似水年华》的结尾点题，有些人像潜入似水年华的巨人，“同时触及间隔甚远的几个时代，而在时代与时代之间被安置上了那么多的日子，那就是在时间之中”。
在时间之中，是什么样的感觉呢。1962年2月4日，小津安二郎生命中最重要的女人，他的母亲离世。那一周的小津日记，倘若没有守灵、吊唁等零星字词的提示，几乎看不出他经历的海啸变故。天天一个“晴”，有时还夹一句：“天气很暖和。梅花全部绽放。哥哥来。”如此，“安静地送走一年”。1963年，小津告别人世进入另一种时间。
时间，也是李斯特的《巡礼之年》的主题。这组钢琴独奏作品集，说来惭愧，我是看了村上春树的小说，《没有色彩的多崎作和他的巡礼之年》，好奇心驱使下才去听的。村上用一部小说诠释李斯特，倒也多少让我理解了这部钢琴曲的第三组第五首，“令人流泪的事”。
小说《没有色彩的多崎作和他的巡礼之年》，也是典型的村上故事。少年多崎作，有四个名字里都带颜色的好朋友，昵称赤、青、白、黑，唯有多崎作，名字里没有颜色，大家叫他“作”，他也因此觉得先天不足。朋友们一起长大，比爱情还美好。五边形一样的五个人，大学时候，只有作离开了名古屋到东京求学，但他们的友情一直灿烂。然后，大二时候，四位好友突然同时从作的世界里撤出，说，我们不再和你做朋友了。作默然接受了小团体的裁决，但一直想自杀。当然，作在孤独中活了下来，后来遇到比他年长的女孩沙罗，在沙罗的鼓励下，返乡寻找被小团体开除的理由，所谓巡礼之年。
这部小说很好读，虽然依然是文艺的黑洞…]]></summary>

《世界文明中的技术》是英国技术史学者阿诺德·佩西（Arnold Pacey）于1991年出版的轻学术著作。经过三十年后，另一名在国际科技史学界享誉已久的英国学者白馥兰（Francesca Bray）受邀与佩西共同对该书进行修订。修订版将论述所涵盖时间下限拉近到二十一世纪，还融入了许多近年新取得的研究进展，2021年英文版问世后，时隔仅一年半中文译本即于2023年初问世，可见全球视野下讨论科技知识发展与传播的著作在中文世界中已经得到相当关注。
如佩西在修订版前言中所说，该书围绕着三个关键概念简述了“自公元1000年起，横跨千年的世界技术发展传播史”，这三个概念分别是技术对话、环境制约和工业革命。近几十年来，这三个概念分别涉及国际科学技术史学界广泛认同存在的研究趋势，但在国内学界还尚无充分实践。佩西与白馥兰在书中对这些概念所作运用可以说是示范性的，因此不仅有益于拓宽公众的视野，对促进学界深入思考也甚有帮助。下文将分别谈论这三个关键概念。
两名作者在书中数次强调，其论述的重点并不在于各类技术的发明，而在于它所参与的跨文化技术对话。当一类技术作为新的要素触碰陌生知识体系时，会与已有要素产生互动，从而激发出创造性不一的各种反应。在较为积极的层面上，外来技术会与本土地域特色相碰撞，发生适应性转变，这些转变不少停留于产生“物理反应”式的外观、使用方式等新型组合，但也不乏与已有要素深度融合，让外来知识得到进一步“化学反应”式创新的例子。若技术在不同文化之间创造的接触相对间接，而生产方式上存在更加基础性的差异，则技术对话的中介物有可能从知识本身转向产品。
李约瑟曾用“激发式传播”来处理地理相隔甚远，而内涵极为接近的技术创造，本书则往往把近代以来质量优异的亚洲手工产品对…]]></summary>

 Basically using the output file as a state file for another crond task to pickup and run with. 
 I have another way of handling it but that involves dealing with our dev team and eating a few weeks arguing, or writing a python script as the stdout target and handling rotating the file contents each message and arguing with dev in a couple years when they change the implementation again.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[在 Ubuntu 和其他发行版中，Python 的默认 IDE IDLE 没有被默认安装。在本指南中了解如何安装它。


IDLE（集成开发学习环境Integrated Development and Learning Environment）是一个 Python IDE，由 Python 语言本身编写，在 Windows 中通常作为 Python 安装 的一部分而安装。它是初学者的理想选择，使用起来很简单。对于那些正在学习 Python 的人，比如学生，它可以作为一个很好的 IDE 来开始使用。

语法高亮、智能识别和自动补全等基本功能是这个 IDE 的一些特点。你可以随时在官方 文档 中了解更多关于 IDLE 的功能。

Ubuntu 和其他 Linux 中的 IDLE

所有的 Linux 发行版，包括 Ubuntu，都预装了 Python。即使你手动升级或安装了 Python 版本，IDLE IDE 也不会自带安装。你必须手动安装它。

对于 Debian、Ubuntu、Linux Mint 和相关发行版，打开终端，运行以下命令来安装 IDLE：

sudo apt update


sudo apt install idle3


当命令询问你是否要安装 IDLE 时，输入 Yes。命令完成后，IDLE 将被安装在你的 Ubuntu 系统中。

对于 Fedora、RHEL、CentOS，使用下面的命令来安装它：

sudo dnf update


sudo dnf install idle3


Arch Linux 用户可以使用以下命令进行安装：

sudo pacman -S python tk




启动 IDLE 并编写一个测试程序

在 Ubuntu、Debian、Linux Mint 和 Fedora 中安装后，你可以在应用菜单中找到 IDLE 的图标。见下图：



如果你使用的是 Arch Linux，你需要在命令行中运行以下内容来启动 IDLE：

idle


启动 IDLE 后，你应该看到主窗口，如下图所示：



默认情况下，它会显示一个 交互界面Shell，你可以直接在每一行中执行 Python 代码。它的工作方式和任何 Shell 解释器一样。而当你点击回车键时，你会得到输出，还有三个 > 符号进入下一行，执行下一个命令。



IDLE 也允许你从它的文件菜单中打开任何 .py 文件。它将在一个单独的窗口中打开该文件，在那里你可以进行修改并直接运行它。你可以使用 F5 或者从选项 “运行Run > 运行模块Run Module” 来运行。





输出会显示在一个单独的输出窗口中。在输出窗口中，你可以开始调试，进入一行或文件，查看堆栈跟踪和其他选项。



总结

现在你学会了如何在 Ubuntu 和其他发行版中安装 IDLE IDE，以及如何运行一条语句或一个 Python 程序。对于初学者来说，IDLE 是一个很好的起点，在进入更复杂的 IDE 之前，可以先掌握基础知识。

我希望这篇指南对你的 Python 之旅有所帮助。

一段开源之旅往往不是独自一人能完成的。你的爱好、职业和生活都受到了科技领域其他人的影响，而数据表明这其中一些影响力来自于女性。这是国际妇女节存在的众多原因之一，也是一起回顾你技术职业生涯中的女性的一个很好的理由。我们向 Opensource.com 的贡献者询问了他们的想法。

励志的女性们

Kathleen Greenaway 博士

我的大学教授 Kathleen Greenaway 博士 是激励过我的女性之一。她正是我想成为的人。我记得她在一次关于打破玻璃天花板的女性活动中说，她无法相信这么多年后我们还在谈论这个问题。我现在发现自己也是这么想的。这只是其中一个例子，但她就是这样。

—— Shanta Nathwani

Hilary Mason

我对 PHP 的入门要归功于 Hilary Mason。当她在普罗维登斯 RI 的 Johnson & Wales 担任教授时，她开了一门服务器端编程的选修课。她向我们展示了 PHP，并在最后一个项目中让我们使用数据库构建了一些东西。我记得我建立了一个简单的登录系统和一个评论工具之类的。我喜欢告诉人们我是从一个女性那里学来的 PHP（她还是 bit.ly 的首席数据科学家！）

—— John E. Picozzi

Carie Fisher

对我来说，科技界最鼓舞人心的女性是 Carie Fisher。我是在刚开始参与无障碍社区时遇到的她。她邀请我一起帮助项目，并在我申请工作、获得认证和在会议上发言时帮助我克服了冒名顶替综合症。在对技术包容性的激情和奉献精神上，只有少数人能与她相提并论。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[勒索软件正在从 Windows 转向 Linux

最近几周，黑客们一直在对 Linux 企业网络部署 IceFire 勒索软件，这是一个值得注意的转变，因为它曾经是一个只针对 Windows 的恶意软件。与 Windows 相比，Linux 更难以大规模部署勒索软件。Linux 系统绝大多数是服务器，典型的感染载体，如网络钓鱼或驱动式下载都不太有效。但基于 Linux 的系统在企业环境中经常被用来执行关键任务，因此，与典型的 Windows 用户相比，这些系统往往是勒索软件行为者更有价值的目标。

老王点评：对于 Linux 来说，即便被勒索，往往损失也比较少，因为起码的备份和替换肯定是有的。




美国计划制定更多云安全法规

美国白宫正在着手实施该国家的第一个全面计划，以监管亚马逊、微软、谷歌和甲骨文等云计算供应商的安全行为。它将要求云供应商核实其用户的身份，以防止外国黑客租用美国云服务器的空间（这是实施特朗普政府行政命令中首次提出的想法）。上周，美国政府在其国家网络安全战略中警告说，更多的云计算法规即将出台。此外，美国官员对云计算供应商经常向客户加收安全保护费用表示非常失望 —— 既利用了对这些措施的需求，又在公司决定不花额外费用时留下了安全漏洞。


消息来源：Politico



老王点评：世界各国都纷纷从国家法规层面开始重视了。




Meta 试水开发一个去中心的 Twitter

据报道，该应用在 Meta 内部被称为 &ldquo92”，通过支持 ActivityPub 协议，很可能可以与 Mastodon 互操作，并且使用 Instagram 来访问。Meta 没有否认此消息，但也没有公开更多细节。除了 Meta，以及 Mastodon 之外，还有很多初创公司也在开发各种去中心化的 Twitter 替代品。据说自马斯克接管 Twitter 以来，其月度活跃用户下降了约 9%，但 Twitter 仍有约 4.5 亿月度活跃用户。


消息来源：The Register



老王点评：去中心化的 Twitter 并不容易成功，我只是觉得 Twitter 并不会败在这些替代品手里，而是被自己祸祸死了。]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[毕罗（章静绘）

意大利汉学家毕罗（Pietro De Laurentis）早在求学时即醉心于中国书法研究，博士论文以孙过庭《书谱》为题。随后他的学术兴趣转向王羲之和《集王圣教序》，并出版了著作《尊右军以翼圣教》（“艺术史：事实与视角丛书”，四川人民出版社2020年6月版）。如今任教于广州美术学院的他，将目光投向了中国书法史上更为开阔的地带，试图通过对写本和石刻的比较研究，去还原唐以前中国书法经典传统的真实样态。在接受《上海书评》专访时，毕罗谈到了中国历史上不同书写材料所生发出的不同书法传统，及其对书法环境与书法生态带来的历史影响。
您提出的中国书法的“私有空间”与“开放空间”这对概念非常有趣。您是怎样想到这对概念的，我们应该如何理解呢？
毕罗：在研究中国书法史的时候，我对具体实物一直很感兴趣，各种写本、石刻以及石刻拓本的相关资料，我搜集得比较全。而在整理敦煌遗书的时候，我关注到了“写”与“书”的区别。在2018年发表的一篇论文中，我指出宋代以前写本和石刻文本题记中经常出现的“某某人书”和“某某人写”两种题法：前者是指面向社会的一种对开放空间的书写签署，后者属于私有空间的写卷范围。综合史料和考古文献，我们就会发现，碑刻上的题记从不出现“某某人写”，反而写本当中提及，虽然“某某人写”为最普遍签署格式，“某某人书”偶尔也会出现。在我看来，写本和石刻记载书写者的姓名和佛教写经有关系，佛教写经逐渐被中国文士接受后，石刻也出现了书写者的姓名，最终“某某书”的署款格式也成了普遍的现象。在不属于佛教写经的写本墨迹中，以“书”署款的用语在宋代印刷术普及以后才在写本题记里占有了绝对的比例。“写”是针对私密翻阅的手卷，“书”是面向社会的碑石。中国古人一旦要把重要的文本刻在石头上，就不仅仅是一件复制文本的事，等于是用手写的方式面向社会，所以需要以隆重的“书”——“书法”的“书”——来命名。这与具…]]></summary>

 I probably made this back in the late 90's when I first learned about linux from someone at a lan party that helped me install slackware from source.
 Its fascinating that even after all these years it still works exactly the same and there has never been any reason to update it. It has just become a visual indicator of if I have set up what ever machine I connect to with my own person settings yet or not.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[DOSBox 是一款自由开源的软件，它可以让你模拟上个世纪的 MS-DOS 操作系统。

你为什么要这么做呢？因为怀旧：它可以让你游玩在 80 年代和 90 年代流行的 8 位游戏。

这其中包含了马里奥、魂斗罗、DOOM 等传奇游戏。

听起来不错吧？让我介绍一下如何在 Ubuntu 中安装 DOSBox。我还会向你展示如何在 DOSBox 中安装并游玩复古游戏。

DOSBox 也可以在其他 Linux 发行版中使用。除了安装部分，其余的指令应该对所有发行版都有效。


✋🏻 DOS 是一个主要基于命令行的操作系统。使用 DOSbox 需要使用终端。


在 Ubuntu 中安装 DOSBox

DOSBox 包可以在 Universe 软件仓库 中找到。这个仓库应该已经被启用了，所以可以使用下面的命令来安装 DOSBox：

sudo apt install dosbox


完成之后，从系统菜单中启动 DOSBox。

或者，你也可以使用终端来启动 DOSBox：

dosbox


需要首先运行一次，因为它会为我们创建一个配置文件。实际上，第一次启动时不需要做任何事情，因为它会创建配置文件。

然后在 DOSBox 终端中执行 exit 命令来关闭 DOSBox：

exit




如果你想要调整配置，配置文件位于 ~/.dosbox/dosbox-[版本].conf。

在这个配置文件中，你可以调整几乎所有的东西，比如在启动 DOSBox 时进入全屏模式，更改核心等等。

但是（对我来说）启用全屏模式会使事情变得更糟，并且必须重新登录才能进入默认模式：



所以，除非你知道你在做什么，否则不要修改配置。

在 DOSBox 中安装游戏

你可以从互联网档案馆的软件库中访问数百款流行游戏。


从互联网档案馆下载游戏


每款游戏都有自己的 zip 文件，其中包含 .exe 文件。下载你喜欢的游戏。

然后，在你的主目录中创建一个新目录，命名为 dosbox，并为你下载的游戏创建目录：

mkdir ~/dosbox && cd ~/dosbox
mkdir [游戏名称]


我下载了马里奥。你可以给目录起任何名字。这里没什么要求，只是为了管理游戏而已。



然后，将 .zip 文件解压到你刚刚创建的 dosbox 目录中：



如果你想的话，你也可以在终端中 使用 unzip 命令 来做同样的事情：

unzip ~/Downloads/MARIO.zip -d ~/dosbox/mario/


当你完成之后，启动 DOSBox：

dosbox


然后，将游戏挂载到虚拟 C 驱动器上：

mount c ~/dosbox/mario




然后，切换到虚拟 C 驱动器：

c:




最后，通过输入游戏的文件名来启动游戏：

mario


然后，享受游戏吧。



想要更多复古的东西？

如果你有不再使用的旧电脑或者树莓派，你可以把它们变成复古游戏机。有很多 Linux 项目就是为了这个目的而存在的。


把你的电脑变成复古游戏机的 Linux 发行版


为什么只玩游戏呢？你也可以把复古的计算机终端带回来。


用 Cool Retro Terminal 获得一个复古的 Linux 终端


希望该指南对你有所帮助。你是如何在 Linux 上玩游戏的？在评论中告诉我吧。

 My interest began in August 2021 using Manjaro Linux to try running Roblox via WINE after I had recently heard that it was able to do so. After messing around with that, I decided to take a look at some other aspects of Manjaro, interested in what it could do, and what programs were available.
 It was fun learning what Linux could do, as well as some of the advantages over Windows that it possessed. You could use applications on a system with 1.5GB RAM usage total, compared to Windows being 4GB idle. Programming was much easier as you didn't have to get and install a whole SDK.

全面的文档。

帮助你入门的有用提示。


在本指南中，我们将演示如何在 RHEL 9 上安装 PgAdmin4。

先决条件

在开始之前，确保你有一台 RHEL 9 服务器实例并安装了 PostgreSQL 数据库。请查看如何在 RHEL 9 上 安装 PostgreSQL 15 的指南。

在安装了 PostgreSQL 服务器后，继续执行以下步骤。

步骤 1）在 RHEL 9 上添加 PgAdmin4 仓库

第一步是在 RHEL 9 上添加 PgAdmin4 仓库。但首先要安装 EPEL 仓库，它提供了基本的软件包。

$ sudo dnf install https://dl.fedoraproject.org/pub/epel/epel-release-latest-9.noarch.rpm


接下来，安装 PgAdmin4 仓库，如下所示：

$ sudo dnf install -y https://ftp.postgresql.org/pub/pgadmin/pgadmin4/yum/pgadmin4-redhat-repo-2-1.noarch.rpm


完成后，为 PgAdmin4 和 EPEL 仓库建立一个缓存，如下所示：

$ sudo dnf makecache

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[One of the greatest strength of Windows/Win32 is that binaries will work on pretty much any version of Windows, whether its 10-20 years old or likely 10 years in the future. The only thing you might need is some VC/.NET redist runtime, and you will be prompted to download it or it will get installed automatically so there's no impact on the end user.
 This is very different from Linux where there's no binary compatibility between distros or versions of a distro. This is due to lacking stable ABIs and ever changing dependencies which means everything must be built again and packaged in each distro's repo. And this is a losing battle which is why we have appimg/flatpack/snaps which have their own problems.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm considering building a session manager for sway, but I'm a bit confused as to what they actually do. Session managers apparently have a distinct role from the display/login manager, and the window/desktop manager(see here and here for context). I'm assuming that it's meant to handle more than just starting the login shell and setting appropriate env variables, but it doesn't seem to be explicitly documented anywhere. 
 some notable projects - here is a desktop manager for the upcoming cosmic DE - here is gnome page on their session manager
 would you guys mind helping me make a list of things it actually needs to handle/do? - activate login shell - track/restore session - detect and set certain environment variables?

 For example, is there any major / practical correlation to knowing Assembly and C when trying to learn Linux and more specifically the Kernel? 
 And I know it could depending on your use case, but for the sake of discussion, let's say it's simply due to an interest in tech as a whole and Linux itself.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[“JBD” stands for “Journal Block Device” (https://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/jammy/man1/pmdajbd2.1.html). “jbd2” is a kernel which is started by executing “kthread_run()” function (https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v6.2.1/source/fs/jbd2/journal.c#L277). The name of the kernel thread has the following pattern “jbd2/[DeviceName]”. The code is part of a kernel module — as you can see in the screenshot below.
 Moreover, as we can see from the code it is a file system journal-writing code (part of the ext2fs journaling system). The journal is an area of reserved disk space used for logging transactional updates. The goal of “jbd2” is to schedule updates to that log (https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v6.2.1/source/fs/jbd2/journal.c).
 The kernel thread executes the “kjournald2()” function (https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v6.2.1/source/fs/jbd2/journal.c#L169). This main thread function is used to manage a logging device journal. Overall, the thread has two main responsibilities: commit and checkpoint. Commit is writing all metadata buffers of the journal. Checkpoint means flushing old buffers in order to reuse an “unused section” of the log file (https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v6.2.1/source/fs/jbd2/journal.c#L152).
 Lastly, JBD was written by Stephen Tweedie and it is filesystem independent. There are different filesystems that are using it like etx3,etx4 and OCFS2. There are two versions: JBD created in 1998 with ext3 and JBD2 forked from JBD in 2006 with ext4 (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Journaling_block_device).
 See you next time ;-)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[微软称多模态的 GPT-4 将在下周发布

在 3 月 9 日举行的一场 AI 活动中，微软德国公司的 CTO Andreas Braun 随意地提到，“我们将在下周推出 GPT-4，它将是一个多模态模型，能够提供完全不同的可能性，比如支持视频。”微软是 OpenAI 的合作伙伴，前两天刚刚 介绍 了其多模态模型 Kosmos-1。在 ChatGPT 正式发布之前，GPT-4 已经经过几个月的测试和微调，几乎已经准备就绪。


消息来源：Heise



老王点评：看来 GPT-4 的变化主要不是一昧的爆参数数量，而是将其从单模态的文本变成了支持文本、视频等多模态方式。




研究发现固态硬盘比机械硬盘更可靠

云存储供应商 Backblaze 发布年度报告，披露其固态硬盘的年度故障率（AFR）为 0.98%，而机械磁盘为 1.64%。该公司公布机械硬盘的 AFR 已经有好几年了，这是它首次公布固态硬盘的 AFR 数字。不过，这次的数据只是基于其不到 3000 块的固态硬盘的数据，置信空间还比较宽。


消息来源：Blocks & Files



老王点评：也就是说，固态磁盘已经很可靠了。




字节跳动发布了开放系统固件 CloudFW 2.0

字节跳动本周在北京举办了 CloudFW 开放系统固件研讨会，他们在会上推出了 CloudFW 2.0，采用 Coreboot 来取代 UEFI。字节跳动将 CloudFW 2.0 宣传为 “业内首个将 x86 服务器上的全栈式开放系统固件产品化的固件解决方案”。

在此次研讨会上还 披露，由于字节跳动这样的大客户，联想现在正在以某种方式支持 LinuxBoot。开源的 LinuxBoot 采用 Linux 内核取代了大部分的 UEFI DXE 模块，这引起了许多超大规模的企业的兴趣。


消息来源：Phoronix



老王点评：很高兴看到中国互联网公司也支持开源硬件。]]></summary>

杀生者不死，生生者不生。
——《庄子·大宗师》
妈妈啊，生活才刚刚开始
然而我却要走了，把一切都丢下
妈妈，噢，我并不想让你流泪
要是我明天这个时候还没回来
就让生活继续吧，就当什么都没发生
——《波西米亚狂想曲》
1914年，在阿尔及利亚，一个男人去看了一场死刑执行仪式。他本来对此“满怀期待”，倒不是因为他生性残忍，而是那名死刑犯实在可恶——此人只为抢夺财物，就将一家农民灭门，包括几个孩子。然而观看之后，男人却形容异常，丝毫不见怒火得到发泄的畅快，反而一回家便倒在床上，过了一会儿突然呕吐不止。“他看过这个场面之后，非但没去想那些被杀的孩子，却总也控制不住去想死刑犯被丢在地上的头颅，以及他倒在地上不断扭动的身躯。”
这个男人是阿尔贝·加缪的父亲。多年后，循着这段家族往事，加缪写下《关于断头台的思考》（Reflexions sur la guillotine）。在这篇论文中，加缪阐释了自己关于支持废除死刑的几点理由，其中最主要的一点或许是死刑并不能起到杀一儆百的效果，“甚至还会使他失去理智，于是为了去死，便以某种方式去杀人了”（《加缪全集·散文卷II》，王殿忠译，上海译文出版社，2010年，387、395页）。
加缪的思考，是战后人道主义思潮的典型产物——尼采的“坏学生”制造了太多死亡，但直到世界变成废墟，人们才开始尝试以合理的方式“重估一切价值”。思考驱动实践，于是二十世纪后半叶关于死刑废除的讨论和实行达到高潮。美国最高法院在1972年宣布死刑违宪，而在此之前，全国各州已经多年未执行死刑。
然而到1976年，却有一个人犯下重罪，而后执意求死。最终法庭满足了他的愿望。
他叫加里·吉尔摩（Gary Gilmore）——由他弟弟米卡尔·吉尔摩（Mikal Gilmo…]]></summary>

出于各种原因，人们需要流式传输网络摄像头的实时视频。树莓派平台很适合此类应用。对于实时流媒体服务器等连续应用，它只需要很少的电力。可以与 Raspicam 相机模块、USB 摄像头或其他网络视频信号进行通信。该系统是一个 RTMP、HLS 和 SRT 服务器。这篇文章展示了如何将树莓派设置为流媒体服务器以使用 HLS 流媒体。你需要一个视频源才能把它作为流媒体服务器使用。

即使没有树莓派，你也可以完成这里描述的步骤。此外，还有针对 Windows、Linux 和 macOS 的进一步安装说明。

设置

该应用程序是 datarhei Restreamer，是 datarhei Core 的图形用户界面。datarhei Core 在底层运行著名的媒体框架 FFmpeg。开始使用 datarhei Restreamer 的最简单方法是安装官方的 Docker 容器。通过 Docker Hub 的程序下载和安装是通过 docker pull 命令自动进行的。安装后，Restreamer 立即启动。如果你没有树莓派，可以使用 datarhei Restreamer GitHub 页面上的其他 Docker 容器之一（例如，支持 AMD64 或 GPU Cuda）。

datarhei Restreamer 和 datarhei Core 都是 Apache 许可证 2.0 下的开源软件。

以下是在支持 GPU 的树莓派 3 及以上机型上的安装命令：

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Garuda Linux 是流行的基于 Arch Linux 的发行版，它刚刚发布了一个新的版本 “Raptor” 200305，带来了新的功能和更新。




Garuda Linux 是一个基于 Arch Linux 的发行版，由于其开箱即用的体验、游戏支持和用户友好界面，在 Arch Linux 爱好者中越来越受欢迎。Garuda Linux 以其对性能、速度和稳定性的关注而闻名。

最近，Garuda Linux 发布了一个新的版本 “Raptor” 200305，带来了新的功能和更新。在这篇文章中，我们将介绍 Garuda Linux 的最新版本的新内容。

Garuda “Raptor” 200305 的新内容

Garuda 的主要旗舰版是 dr460nized 版，采用 KDE Plasma 桌面环境，但它用 Latte Dock、图标主题等进行了大量定制。

由于 Latte Dock 现在已经没有支持了，Garuda 团队完全删除了 Latte Dock，用标准的 Plasma 面板取代了它。按照该团队的说法，“由于失去了顶栏颜色/透明度等功能，在一定程度上削弱了 dr460nized 版的吸睛因素”。

这的确是事实。但是，没有其他停靠区软件能像 Latte Dock 一样。我的意思是，虽然有，但它们都没有接近 Latte Dock 曾经提供的功能和灵活性。但好处是，KDE Plasma 在 Garuda 中可能会变得更稳定，因为它现在使用了原生的停靠区和面板。而且它看起来也很好！



那么，如果你已经在运行带有 Latte Dock 的早期版本的 Garuda 呢？

为了解决这个问题，团队调整了 “Garuda 系统维护Garuda System Maintenance” 应用程序，以检测你是否已经在运行 Latte Dock，并为你提供逐步迁移到新的面板的方法。一旦你确认从 Latte Dock 迁移，它还会备份你的配置，以防迁移过程中出现问题。这方面的更多信息可以在这个 指南 中找到。

除了上述变化，Garuda Linux “Raptor” 230305 还重写了设置帮助，改进了标签式界面和检测英伟达硬件的能力。

这个版本的一个重要更新是，Garuda 现在使用 Dracut 来创建 initramfs，而不是像包括原本的 Arch Linux 在内的大多数 Arch 发行版常见的 mkiniticpio。

不止如此。从这个版本开始有了一个新的 “garuda” 软件库，它是为 Garuda Linux 专属的软件包创建的，并从当前的 Chaotic-AUR 软件库中移出。这是最大的变化之一，它通过 “garuda-update” 自动处理的。可以在 这里 了解更多。



在核心部分，这个版本带有最新的 KDE Plasma 5.27.2 桌面和 Linux 内核 6.2.2。所以，由于滚动发布，你可以得到所有最新的软件包。

如果你想探索更多的更新，你可以 在此 阅读整个更新日志。

要下载它，请访问以下页面并选择你要下载的变体：


下载 Garuda Linux


如果你已经在运行 Garuda Linux，那么从欢迎程序中启动 Gaurda 帮助Gaurda Assistance，并点击 “系统更新system update”。

总结

这是一个重要的 Garuda 版本，涉及到其旗舰 KDE 版的所有主要组件。对 pacman 偏好和 Dracut 的核心更新更是影响了所有的版本。

然而，所有的变化都是为了使它成为一个比以前更稳定的系统。我希望它能继续带来这样的更新，成为最好的 Arch Linux 发行版之一。

As a managed platform that brings modern development standards to background jobs (ex: multi-env support, zero-API design), we enable Node.js developers to build products faster and scale without effort and infrastructure knowledge.
Background jobs, while being used in all web applications (processing webhooks, interacting with 3rd party APIs, or powering core features), did not benefit from the developer experience improvements that arose in all other layers of the Node.js API stack: quick and reliable databases with Supabase or easy Serverless deployment with Vercel.

waters. No team is the same as any other, so copying, say, the Blender Foundation’s
approach to governance will, most likely, not work for other projects.  But
there is value in understanding how various non-commercial organizations
operate in order to make informed decisions for the governance of new ones.
In late 2021, the FreeCAD team
launched the FreeCAD Project
Association (FPA) to handle the various assets that belong to this free
3D CAD project. In this interview, Yorik van Havre, a longtime FreeCAD
developer — and current president of the Association — guides us through
the process of starting and managing the FPA.]]></summary>

 It took quite some time, but after years of overhaul, testing, and patching I'd like to introduce Albert. New features (since 0.18) include an abstract plugin system, custom triggers, an API which got more developer friendly and of course feature rich for both C++ and Python plugins, plugins come with more features, search is even faster, UI is nicer, Qt6, C++20… Give it a try and let me know what you think.

 This is a cool tool, but I'd like to use it as a VST plugin rather then a standalone application. But it didn't work. There is a github issue: https://github.com/essej/paulxstretch/issues/23 
 Author seem no to care about that atm, so I've decided to try updating `JUCS libs` to the newer version. So if it sounds interesting, you can try using this build to run inside a DAW: https://git.badhouseplants.net/badhouseplants/paulxstretch/releases/tag/v1.0.0-dev 
 The CLAP version seem not to work yet, but will try to fix it soon. 
 Since I can't promise 100% availability for my server, if it sounds interesting, I'll mirror the repo to github and will be publishing releases there as well.

 Penguins-eggs allows you to easily create a live- and installable version of your current system, much like remastersys in the old days. It's like equipping your machine with a reproductive system.
 Features:
  
Produces an installable ISO extremely fast.
 Optional customizable GUI installer (calamares) or a minimal CLI installer for the new machine.
 Can delete itself from the new machine after installation.
 Customizable promotional material, like icons and installer slides.
  
If you like linux-mint, check out my linux mint respin which was made with penguins-eggs. Thanks, Piero!

 Decided to make a VM of Debian 11 with no xorg install or window-manager so I could build it from the ground. So far got WindowMaker/GNUStep going and a few utilities. As well as a few aliases. Also got the slim login manager installed.
 Examples:
 alias ipinfo="curl ipinfo.io/ip"
 alias fetch="neofetch"
 I got sudo working but, I plan to replace it will OpenDOAS soon.
 I also plan to make a few Java Swing apps with Apache Netbeans in the VM.
 I will soon demonstrate this on my YouTube channel. Although I will most likely start over for YouTube.
 Perhaps after this, I might do it again but with FreeBSD. (Maybe KfreeBSD if I can get it to actually start.)

广泛被开源社区使用的谷歌的邮件列表和网络论坛服务 “谷歌群组Google Groups” 正在腐烂中，尽管谷歌还没有正式宣布关闭它。它的基本功能已经逐渐停止工作：比如它的搜索功能早就出故障了；Monospace 字体停止了渲染，代码示例难以阅读；已读/未读标志工作不正常，用户刚刚访问的主题或者自己的帖子或回复都被标记为未读；用户提交的帖子或回复会间歇性的被删除；辛苦撰写的帖子提交后但却返回删除的信息等等。


消息来源：Andrew Helwer



老王点评：毕竟，这是不挣钱而落后的社区交流方式了。虽然有 Discord 等新的交流方式，但是我想开源社区需要一个非专有的、去中心化的、符合传统的社区交流方式。

微软称，必应在推出其 AI 聊天机器人一个月后，日活用户已突破 1 亿。当然，微软仍然充分意识到，它仍然只是 “一个小的、低的、个位数份额的玩家”。得益于其 AI 机器人，必应的日活用户中有三分之一是第一次使用该搜索引擎。

老王点评：至少，微软必应看起来押对了。




2024 款福特野马删除了调幅收音机

福特汽车称，“全球的国家/地区和汽车制造商正在通过移动应用程序、调频或数字无线电提供互联网流媒体来实现广播的现代化。”在过去的十年里，随着媒体消费习惯的转变，新汽车中的调幅（AM）收音机的可用性已经下降，调幅收音机的听众在欧洲已经蒸发，在美国人口中也只占少数。但应急部门对此提出反对，他们认为调幅广播是美国国家警报网络的重要组成部分，只需 75 个电台就可以覆盖全国 90% 以上的人口。

老王点评：自从到了海南，我的汽车里的 AM 广播就没收到过信号，我记得若干年前在北京还是能收到的。其实 AM 广播确实用处不大了，但是在应急警报方面有独特的优势。]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[linode has Gentoo in its list of distributions for you to choose.
 however - if you want to go with one of the cheaper options (eg. 1 CPU, 2GB RAM) it is hard to update all packages without tweaks: https://i.imgur.com/v2B380g.png
 and you'll find yourself running on an older (gen)kernel. For me it was on 5.15.59 and gentoo offered me 6.1.12.
 So, this is what i did to upgrade to the latest genkernel and all other packages:
 ​
 1.) sync
 emerge --sync 
 2.) If sync detects a newer portage version, install it
 emerge --oneshot sys-apps/portage 
 3.) Use rust-bin instead of rust
 emerge --ask --unmerge dev-lang/rust emerge --ask --oneshot virtual/rust dev-lang/rust-bin echo 'dev-lang/rust' >> /etc/portage/package.mask/rust 
 4.) Update @world without gcc
 emerge app-misc/screen screen -S emerge emerge -uavDN @world --exclude gcc emerge --depclean 
 5.) Because of 2GB RAM change CFLAGS and MAKEOPTS in /etc/portage/make.conf
 #CFLAGS="-O2 -pipe" CFLAGS="-02" MAKEOPTS="-j1" 
 now compile gcc (it'll take some time - use screen again)
 emerge -uavDN @world 
 and change CFLAGS and MAKEOPTS back to their defaults.
 6.) Compile the latest genkernel with the old kernel config (inside a screen session)
 genkernel --kernel-config="/etc/kernels/kernel-config-<VERSION_NUMBER>-gentoo-x86_64" all 
 7.) write grub-config
 grub-mkconfig -o /boot/grub/grub.cfg 
 After a reboot you'll find yourself in a "cheap" up-to-date gentoo system. Have fun!

去年年底，美国Open AI研制的ChatGPT正式上线，在不到两个月的时间里注册用户破亿，随即引发关于未来的热烈讨论。联想当年AlphaGo打败世界冠军和基因编辑技术实验引发的对人类未来的担忧，可以说人类及其社会已经处在大变革中，而这个大变革具有很大的不确定性，甚至带有某种危险性。对未来的憧憬（夹杂着些许恐惧）使未来学成为人们渴望了解的知识领域。
未来学（Futurology）亦称预测学，是采用综合研究方法对未来的各个方面的发展前景进行性质上的或总体或专项的判断、途径上的或选择控制或创造适应的预测的科学。虽然它首创于1943年，但因为它对人类永远关注和无法确认的未来的战略性探讨而迅速发展，甚至成为左右时代潮流和影响未来发展的显学。未来学随着改革开放进入中国，对中国人认识世界和中国的走向发挥了重要作用，帮助中国人或有效确立自己的追赶方向，或有效避免赶超中可能会出现的问题。1983年开始编辑出版的《走向未来》丛书既启蒙了一代中国学人和青年官员，使其能够睁眼看世界和未来，而且对中国走向世界和未来的政策设计和规划产生了积极的、不可忽视的作用。
上世纪八十年代是个激情澎湃、积极向上的时代，几乎所有人的奋进和赶超热情都被点燃，人们的求知欲空前旺盛。丛书的出版恰逢其时，正如编者所言，它不但记录了一代人对祖国命运和人类未来的思考，还是一项为了人类福祉和尊严的事业。当时给我冲击最大的是罗马俱乐部的《增长的极限》和西蒙的《没有极限的增长》。前者用四个维度形成一个模型，分析人类发展，认为工业化会在未来某一天突然崩溃。后者针对前者的观点和方法，采用历史外推而非技术分析的方法，指出资源没有尽头，而人口自然会走向平衡。如果说前者是未来学中的悲观派，那么后者无疑就…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Xubuntu 团队从 23.04 版本开始推出了一个包含少量组件的精简 ISO。以下是它的情况。




几天前，Canonical 宣布，Ubuntu 23.04 “Lunar Lobster” 版本官方的精简 ISO 安装文件正在制作中。虽然截至发稿时，该镜像还没有出现，但 Xubuntu 团队设法推出了他们自己的精简 ISO 安装镜像。

Xubuntu 被数百万人使用，并且一直是许多其他发行版的基础。对于一些用户来说，默认安装可能带有太多的预装包和功能，导致系统臃肿，计算机性能降低。这就是 Xubuntu 精简安装发挥作用的地方。在这篇文章中，我们将采取实践的方式来安装和探索精简版 Ubuntu 的功能。

让我们看看你在 Xubuntu 精简安装中得到了什么，以及与普通桌面安装程序的比较。

Xubuntu 精简安装

第一个明显的区别是精简安装与标准桌面安装程序的 ISO 镜像大小。它的大小大约减少了 39%。




 
精简版
标准版




桌面安装程序（ISO）大小
1.7 GB
2.8 GB



在使用精简版安装程序安装 Xubuntu 时，你不会在 Ubiquity 中看到“精简安装minimal install”的选项。其余的安装步骤都是一样的，没有区别。

然而，主要的区别是在安装的系统上。最小安装只需要 7.2GB 的磁盘空间，而同一版本的标准安装则需要 11GB。




 
精简版
标准版




磁盘使用空间
7.2 GB
11 GB



因为许多应用程序被剥离了。



在 Xubuntu 的精简安装中，你会得到以下东西：


终端

文件管理器

所有的设置应用

Synaptic 包管理器

屏幕截图应用


就这些了。

如果你把它与标准版相比，你就不会有以下的应用：


Firefox 浏览器

Thunderbird 邮件客户端

媒体播放器（音频和视频）

LibreOffice 套件

Transmission Torrent 客户端

GNOME 软件

游戏

Gigolo 远程连接客户端

磁盘使用工具


精简版 Xubuntu 上的 Snap 包

令我惊讶的是，精简版 Xubuntu 没有安装 Snap！甚至连 Snap 守护程序都没有。而且也没有 Flatpak。

所以，实际上你得到的是一个没有 Snap 的 Xubuntu 系统，但有一个核心的 Ubuntu 基础。



但我不确定主 Ubuntu 的精简 ISO 会有同样的情况。我想我们需要等待和观察。

接下来是什么？

所以，现在你有了一个初级的 Xubuntu 桌面。使用 Synaptic 包管理器，你可以开始构建和安装你喜欢的应用。

例如，你可以 设置 Flatpak 并从一个基本的浏览器、媒体播放器、LibreOffice 等开始。

如果你是一个开发者，你可以安装 Visual Studio Code 或一些 IDE。

以这个版本为基础，你可以为你的工作流程建立任何发行版。

总结

Xubuntu 精简安装对于那些想要完全控制他们系统上安装的东西，并且喜欢更快、更有效的基于 Ubuntu 的发行版的用户来说是一个很好的选择。

Xfce 的可定制性、轻量级特性和使用 synaptic 的包管理使它成为任何定制构建的理想选择。

你可以从这个 页面 下载精简版 ISO。记住，它还没有正式发布，而且是一个日常构建的副本。所以使用它要谨慎。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[即将推出的 Vanilla OS 2.0 “Orchid” 将基于 Debian Sid 而不是 Ubuntu Linux。


来自 Ubuntu 的 Flatpak 决定 的余震仍在继续！Vanilla OS 团队宣布，Vanilla OS 的下一个版本将不再基于 Ubuntu。它将基于 Debian Sid，这是 Debian Linux 的 “滚动” 版本，或者说 “不稳定” 版本。


如果你不知道，Vanilla OS 是一个新的不可变 Linux 发行版，它首次发布于去年。它的目标是提供 GNOME 桌面的 “原味” 体验。它有一套独特的工具，如 apx 软件包管理器、ABRoot 技术、原装 GNOME 体验等等。它基于标准的 Ubuntu 发布周期和版本进行发布。




Vanilla OS 计划基于 Debian

由于这些重大变化，Vanilla OS 的下一个版本将被命名为 “2.0” “兰花Orchid”。但为什么要远离 Ubuntu 呢？

正如该团队所说，花了更多的困难和精力 “来恢复 Canonical 武断的工作流程”，这需要更多的开发时间。另外，Ubuntu 提供的 GNOME 是根据 Canonical 的需求和愿景定制的。所以，没有太多的 “原味” 体验。

第二个原因是处理 Snap 的问题。经过几次测试和社区反馈，团队认为目前的 Snap 并不适合 Vanilla OS 的使用情况。例如，“启动慢、集中化” 的问题在 Snap 核心里没有得到解决，而且 Snap 不能在 Vanilla OS 的 apx 容器内运行。

发布模式

此外，脱离 Ubuntu 的基础会带来一个更灵活的发布周期，将不需要遵循每年两个版本的周期。这给了小型 FOSS 开发者和贡献者团队一些喘息的空间。

但是未来的发布模式是什么呢？团队将遵循一种临时性的发布方式，用著名的术语来说就是 —— “当需要或准备好时就会发布”。例如，如果某个 Debian Sid 软件包得到一个关键的 CVE 修复，那么你可能会立即得到一个 Vanilla OS 的小版本。所以，这要视情况而定，应该以需求为基础。

此外，该团队还计划减少 ISO 文件中的软件包数量，以减少软件包 “不稳定” 因素的风险。但根据我使用 Debian Sid 的经验，如果你遵循适当的更新并谨慎行事，它可以视作一个 “稳定” 的发行版。

另外，其他变化还有对 ABRoot 的 OCI 更新，以加强对更新的控制。在设置中的一个新的快速的高级选项是即将发布的版本中值得注意的内容。

在核心方面，基于 Debian Sid 软件包情况，新版本计划采用 GNOME 44 和主线内核 6+。

结论

总之，基于 Debian 的确是一个大的进步。虽然它确实在发布周期上提供了更多的灵活性，但在向用户提供稳定版之前，它也会对 Sid 软件包进行更仔细的测试。总的来说，在我们等待 Vanilla OS 2.0 “Orchid” 的测试版本时，未来的时间是令人期待的。

 And while most are heavily downvoted reddit sucks and still shows posts with negative karma on the front page.
 So could we at least have a megathread or temporary ban on chatGPT posts, at least for a couple of weeks when all the credulous rubes will be giving their data to Bing/Bard/BoredAppClub2/TheNextBigThing?

 This is probably a stupid question, so apologies. Basically I have an old laptop I want to turn into a barebones electric typewriter - it'd have a word processor and a file system and functional USB ports and that's basically it. No wifi access at all would be ideal, and definitely no web browser or anything distracting. Does a distro like this already exist and, if not, is there a small, light, customisable distro that would let me achieve my goal? 
 Thanks!!

Why we did that?
During a YC meetup I spoke with a fellow founder that told me how hard it was to pick the right external APIs to use within your own projects. I realized that most of what we build relies on public APIs from external vendors, but there was no benchmark to help developers compare and evaluate public APIs before picking one. So we decided to do it ourselves. Say hi to apirank.dev.

Second is a developer platform that connects your GitHub account to a bot that can generate new web applications or add features to existing ones. You log in and configure the features you want, and this prompts a bot to create and modify code files using a combination of compilers and GPT-3, then raise a pull request or commit the changes directly to a repo.
You can use Second to create a brand new web application, or you can connect it to an existing web application. They run in the cloud and connect directly to your Github, so you don’t have to install anything. Here’s a demo video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IR9JUxznEC0.

 Say I have the kernel image “kern_1” and I’m asked “what is the size of the kernel module image on disk” 
 I would use lsmod, look at the size listed.
 But I’m also wondering about whether “on disk” makes a difference. My second thought is to use modinfo, get the file name, use ls -lisa [kern_1 filepath] and get the size there.
 These sizes are different which makes me think I’m understanding this incorrectly. 
 Why are the sizes different?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I hacked together a 2 liner to automatically ask chatGPT for help when a command fails to execute successfully and suggest a solution.
 prerequisites: 
  
install https://github.com/0xacx/chatGPT-shell-cli
 create an openAI/chatGPT account
 create an API key https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys
 add the following to your .bashrc and fill in the API key:
  
 export OPENAI_KEY="enter key here"
 exec > >(tee $HOME/log.txt) 2>&1
 trap 'printf "chatgpt: \033[37;0m$(chatgpt -p "$(echo "I got this output in the terminal: $(grep -a "^]0;" log.txt | tail -1 | head -n 1 | sed -r s/\x1b[[@-~]*[@-~]//g | col -b | sed -r "s/0;[a-z0-9-]+@[a-z0-9-]+:~\?2004h//g")\n $(grep -a -v "^]0;" log.txt | tail -1 | head -n 1 | sed -r s/\x1b[[^@-~]*[@-~]//g | col -b | sed -r "s/0;[a-z0-9-]+@[a-z0-9-]+:~\?2004h//g") What is wrong and how can i fix it? \nI am running $(lsb_release -a)\n\n with the kernel $(uname -mrs)"|jq -R -s '.')")\033[0;0m\n"' ERR
  
optionally you can also add an explain function that provides guidance for commands that do not fail:
  
function explain(){
 $1
 printf "chatgpt: \033[37;0m$(chatgpt -p "$(echo "I got this output in the terminal: $(grep -a "^]0;" log.txt | tail -1 | head -n 1 | sed -r s/\x1b[[^@-~][@-~]//g | col -b | sed -r "s/0;[a-z0-9-]+@[a-z0-9-]+:~\?2004h//g" | sed -r "s/explain //g")\n $(grep -a -v "^]0;" log.txt | tail -1 | sed -r s/\x1b[[^@-~][@-~]//g | col -b | sed -r "s/0;[a-z0-9-]+@[a-z0-9-]+:~\?2004h//g")\n I do not know what is going on there. Could you please explain?"|jq -R -s '.')")\033[0;0m\n"
 }
  
this might be helpful to newbies but i can also see how this can create confusion. i wanted to post this here to see if you can turn this into something useful or at least interesting and what your views are on this
 note that it sends the promt, the output and the output for uname -mrs and lsb_release(for context) to chatgpt

有用户发帖称，惠普更新了打印机固件禁止使用非惠普墨盒。以前惠普打印机可以使用第三方墨盒，但会显示“无法保证打印质量”的警告信息。现在它在检测到第三方墨盒之后会停止打印，除非换上官方墨盒才能继续工作。惠普客服表示，该公司最近向其生产的所有打印机释出了禁止非官方墨盒的更新。


消息来源：Reddit



老王点评：就在去年，惠普还因为禁用第三方墨盒而赔偿了 135 万美元。这是找到了可以免于被诉讼索赔的方法了吗？




谷歌展示无需特别训练的机器人通用 AI 模型

PaLM-E 是一个用于机器人控制的多模态体现的视觉语言模型（VLM），它整合了视觉和语言。他们声称这是迄今为止开发的最大的 VLM，它可以执行各种任务，而不需要重新训练。PaLM-E 通过分析来自机器人摄像头的数据来将指令转换为行动，而不需要预先处理的场景表示。这消除了人类对数据进行预处理或注释的需要，使机器人控制更加自主。PaLM-E 基于谷歌现有的大型语言模型（LLM）PaLM，它与 ChatGPT 背后的技术类似。


消息来源：Ars Technica



老王点评：也就是以后机器人可以自己看自己干活了，不需要预先训练？我怎么感觉有点害怕。




微软 Azure 云提供真实的量子计算平台

微软认为，需要一台相当强大的 P 级超级计算机，能够以 10-100 Tbit/s 的速度与量子元素连接，才能实现容错的量子计算机，而只有云才能提供实现这一目标所需的规模。本周，微软向公众提供了 Azure Quantum 平台，以实现这一目标。与一些在仿真环境中提供量子计算，以帮助开发者探索使用量子算法的项目不同，微软似乎是在真正的量子硬件上做这件事，微软与一系列使用各种技术的量子计算供应商建立了合作。但该产品并不是针对生产工作负载的，主要是针对那些有相当高的预算的研究人员和科学家运行探索性应用。


消息来源：The Register



老王点评：最近的一些技术进步，让人感觉似乎处于新科技爆发前夜，或许很快这个世界就不同了。]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[微软宣布了一项新的测试，将允许Insider用户在Windows和Mac的Word中使用行业标准的缩放键盘快捷键。尽管已经存在了四十年，Windows和Mac版的Word仍然缺乏使用Ctrl +/-组合来放大和缩小文档的功能。现在，Windows和Mac用户的Word应该很快就能实现这一功能。


据微软称，它现在正在向运行Windows 16.0.15831.2014版或更高版本和Mac 16.67.1113.0版或更高版本的Beta Insiders推出这一功能。


除了熟悉的Ctrl +/-组合外，该测试允许使用Ctrl键和鼠标滚动来放大和缩小文档。微软还增加了使用Ctrl + 0键盘快捷键返回到100%缩放视图的功能。该公司说，除了这些控制之外，该测试还涉及对一些现有快捷键的调整。


在此公告之前，微软还向Insider推出了“仅粘贴文本”的键盘快捷方式。与缩放控制一样，Ctrl + Shift + V（Mac上为Cmd + Shift + V）的快捷键此前在Windows和Mac版Word中不可用。


微软还解释了迟迟引入这种功能的原因：


“虽然工程团队继续致力于开发新的功能，以通过刷新和更先进的技术改善用户体验，但我们并不总是有机会修改先前存在的行为，”微软Word产品经理Ali Forelli说。“就键盘快捷键而言，行业标准已经偏离了Word对这些功能的最初实现。事实上，用户期望Ctrl + Shift + V可以粘贴纯文本，所以当这一功能不工作时，这种体验会令人沮丧。Word团队从用户那里听说了这个问题，所以我们正在更新键盘快捷键，作为对您的反馈的直接回应。可访问性是Word的一个优先事项，我们希望尽可能使剪切、复制、粘贴的体验无缝衔接”。

W.J.T.米切尔（W.J.T.Mitchell）的《元图像：图像及其理论话语》（Metapictures: Images  and the Discourse of Theory,唐宏峰译,上海人民出版社2023年1月）是“OCAT研究中心年度讲座”丛书第四辑，中英双语，由四个章节及讲座问答构成。作者在该书中提出的问题是他几十年来对元图像理论思考的总结与反思，从源自讲座的性质来看该书既有生动的叙述性（“在此，我无非是想讲个故事”），同时又有面对观众提问的现场感，可以看作是一种严格的纯理论文本的简写版，虽然它涉及的理论思维并没有因此而变得浅显。
究竟什么是“元图像”？作者自述在二十世纪八十年代晚期开始思考“元图像”这一概念，关注的是图像是否具有“自我理论化”的能力这一问题。“如果其他学科如语言学，号称‘元语言’可以命名所有的发言和写作，如果心理学也要求一套称为‘元心理学’的辅助工具，那为什么图像学不行呢？为什么不能有元图像？”（前言，第2页）艺术家弗莱达·德士法乔吉斯为米切尔画了一张周围充满了他个人研究中的那些核心图像的肖像，米切尔看来是比较满意的，认为这些图像的一个共同点是，“它们都不仅仅是某物的图像，更是能够反思其自身生成过程属性的图像，我称之为‘元图像’。元图像的全部重点在于，抵制那种认为图像仅仅是语言之阐释的消极对象的普遍观点”（12页）。能够反思自身生长过程，并非仅是语言阐释的消极对象，这是“元图像”的两个基本要素。
我觉得仿照弗莱达·德士法乔吉斯，动手为米切尔画一幅肖像也是进入他的元图像理论的一种体验，阅读、写作与图绘的结合或许会使关于图像理论的思考更有感性的质感。正如米切尔所讲的，图像当然会激发人的欲望与全身心的投入…]]></summary>

潘恩的政治导师富兰克林曾宣称，“自由之处是吾国”，对此潘恩回应道，“自由缺失之处是吾国”——美国独立战争爆发前，潘恩离开英国奔赴美洲殖民地，因为他不忍直视殖民地人民遭受横征暴敛。在实地考察后，潘恩发表政治宣传册《常识》（Common Sense），揭穿“君权神授”的真面目——“在英国，除了发动战争和割让领土，国王几乎无事可做；坦白来说，就是把国家变得一贫如洗，纷争不断。对于个人来说，让他每年收入八十万英镑，且受人顶礼膜拜，这确实是桩好买卖！”与此同时，他号召大陆会议与英国彻底决裂。

潘恩的政论文极大鼓舞了殖民地军民的革命士气：1776年底，在横渡特拉华河途中，华盛顿命令大陆军官兵传诵潘恩的《美国危机》，其中的名句“这是考验人们灵魂的时刻”最能激发革命斗志。结果，大陆军顺利攻克特伦顿，随后成功袭取普林斯顿，一举扭转战局。正如另一位革命元勋约翰·亚当斯日后所言：“如果没有《常识》作者的笔，华盛顿的剑就会徒劳无功。”
凭借他在美国革命中建立的巨大声望，潘恩与富兰克林、华盛顿、麦迪逊、汉密尔顿等人一道被授予法国“荣誉公民”身份。尽管潘恩的法语并不流畅，但他还是作为加来海峡省（Pas-de-Calais）代表当选国民公会议员，数日后又被选为国民公会宪法委员会代表（共九名），承担为法兰西共和国草拟宪法的神圣使命。
这是潘恩在法国政坛的高光时刻，也是他和法国大革命领袖的“蜜月期”。与潘恩关系最为密切的是当时占据政坛主导地位的吉伦特派（如布里索、佩蒂翁、罗兰夫妇等人）：革命上层中能说英语的人不多——少数特例如拉法…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[跟随这个 Inkscape 教程，大量创建会议讲座卡图形。


我录制了一个 15 分钟长的教程，演示如何在 Inkscape 中从 CSV 文件或电子表格中自动生成图形（基本上是邮件合并类图形）。它使用了 Maren Hachmann 的 Next Generator Inkscape 扩展。

你可以在 Fedora 设计团队在 Linux Rocks 上的 PeerTube 频道（PeerTube 是开源的！）中观看。

在这篇文章中，我提供了一些关于这个教程相关的背景。我还包括了对视频中内容的一个非常简要的总结，以防你宁愿草草浏览文字而不看视频。

会议讲座卡图形

每个 Flock/Nest 都需要为你在举办虚拟会议的在线平台上的每个讲座提供一个图形。像这样的大型活动，通常有大约 50 个或更多的讲座。这需要大量手工制作的图形。

通过本教程，你将学习如何在 Inkscape 中制作这样的模板。



CSV 文件类似这样：




CONFERENCENAME
TALKNAME
PRESENTERNAMES




BestCon
The Pandas Are Marching
Beefy D. Miracle


Fedora Nest
Why Fedora is the Best Linux
Colúr and Badger


BambooFest 2022
Bamboo Tastes Better with Fedora
Panda


AwesomeCon
The Best Talk You Ever Heard
Dr. Ver E. Awesome



将它们结合起来，CSV 中的每一行生成一个图形，像这样：

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[这个使用树莓派集群的学术实验向远程教育学生介绍了并行和分布式计算（PDC）的概念。


自从树莓派推出以来，创造者们已经在这个简陋的袖珍芯片系统上开展了无数的计算机科学教育项目。其中包括许多探索低成本树莓派集群的项目，以介绍 并行和分布式计算Parallel and Distributed Computing（PDC）概念。

英国 开放大学Open University（OU）为不同年龄、经历和背景的学生提供远程教育，这就提出了一些在更传统的大学中没有面临的问题。开放大学使用树莓派集群向远程教育学生介绍 PDC 概念的实验始于 2019 年，并在一篇 学术论文 中进行了介绍，但值得更广泛地了解。

该项目使用基于 OctaPi 教程 的树莓派集群，该指令由 GCHQ 在知识共享许可协议下发布。八个树莓派使用一个路由器和一个交换机连接在一个私人网络中。其中一个树莓派充当主控，而其他的是服务器，将结果反馈给主控设备。用 Python 编写的程序运行在主控树莓派，而 dispy 包将活动分发在集群的各个处理核心上。


OctaPi 教程


他们为该集群开发了三个程序，你可以从 Git 仓库 下载它们。

其中两个程序是基于文本的，并与搜索问题有关：旅行推销员和密码散列。作为完整的搜索问题，这些是教授 PDC 概念的理想选择。第三个程序是图形化的。图像组合器将三幅图像作为输入，其中有不重叠的障碍物。它通过对三幅图像的 RGBA 值进行逐个像素的比较并选择中位数来构建一个没有任何障碍物的图像。

使用集群

开放大学是一个远程学习机构，所以学生通过网页界面访问集群。对集群的远程访问使用大学的 OpenSTEM 实验室的基础设施。10 个集群（8 个用树莓派 4 构建，2 个用树莓派 3B+ 建造）被安装在机架上，用网络摄像头对准每个集群。

学生们选择要运行的程序，使用的核心数量，以及所选程序的参数。作为输出，他们可以看到该程序在单个树莓派上运行的时间与使用所选核数的集群的时间相比。学生还可以看到程序的输出，如密码散列结果、最小和最大的旅行推销员路线，或未遮挡的图像。



网络摄像头显示了集群的实时流。主控树莓派有一个 LED 显示屏，显示程序运行时的状态。网络摄像头让学生清楚地知道，他们是在用真正的专用硬件做实验，而不是得到模拟的或预先录制的结果。



每个程序都有两个与之相关的活动，描述了程序设计和 PDC 操作的不同方面。其中一个主要的学习点是，PDC 计算可以提供显著的性能优势，但代价是划分和分发问题以及反过来重新组合结果所花费的时间和资源。第二个学习点是，效率受程序设计的影响很大。

学生喜欢

目前，树莓派集群的使用是可选的。不过根据目前的研究结果，学生们很喜欢它，并因能远程接触到物理硬件而受到激励。

一位学生说：“能够使用真正的集群，而不是让它虚拟化，这真的很有趣”。

另一名学生补充说：“能够真正看到集群的工作，看到多核工作的真实效果，这真的很令人兴奋。能够亲自尝试，而不仅仅是阅读有关理论，这真是太好了！”

学生们正在使用集群开展旨在教授 PDC 原理的学习活动，而不是编写和运行他们自己的程序。开发低成本的树莓派集群供远程大学学生使用的经验表明，远程实践活动对教授 PDC 概念和吸引学生有好处。

当我向该项目背后的团队成员之一 Daniel Gooch 询问时，他说：“对我来说，我们的不同之处在于，我们采用了一套现有的树莓派教程，并致力于整合更多外围材料，以确保它能够应对我们操作的距离和规模。”

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am looking for a very specific a piece of software, I have decided to save this copy and paste question to find if it exists or someone willing out of good will to make something like this. 
 If you don't know what a seat is it is simply a group of input where each group acts seperatly, so mutiple users could use the same computer. Each user would have there own mouse, cursor, keyboard, and other input devices. This is their seat.
 It would map a certian wayland seat (could support multi-seat X too) to a specific virtual controller. Ideally it would map the seat to a controler when the cursor was on a window where you wanted the mapping of a controler for but this would likely require modifications to the wayland protocol and compositers. The easier way to do this would just to be a seperate window that could be focused to map the seat. It would be fairly simply in terms of button mapping just mapping custom direction keys to the joysticks and other keys to buttons on the controller. I'm sure why or how the dev would add a way to map a cursor to a controller but if they did there is a wayland protocol that exists to lock the mouse to a window.
 The reason I ask this is some games have local split screen multi- player but they only accept one keyboard and need controllers for other players. Getting devs to do these on linux-supporting games would be insanely hard. As for games run through wine, in my case why I'm asking this Rain World, it would be impossible without some obsecure modification to wine and adding in some wierd feature that was intended for use when being emulated through wine as windows doesn't even have any protocols for multi-seat support to my knowledge.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm primarily a GUI user that's forced to use terminal for work. I'm interested in what the Windows GUI offers that Linux can't compete with. 
 I'd like to switch fully to Linux on my personal computer, but I'm a bit hesitant after using Linux at work. I really don't like fiddling around with terminal and CLI commands and the Red Hat Xfce UI at work leaves a lot to be desired. Namely:
  
You can't edit the directory path in the file file manager. You have to navigate by double clicking on folders.
 Applications don't have previews when hovered
 Windows from the same application don't group into single tab in the taskbar. 
 There is no way to reset the graphics drivers during a crash (like cntr+shft+win+b in windows)
 The standard text editors don't include a lot of functionality. The settings they do offer are often clunky and not verbose and sometimes require text commands. VSCode is an exception here.
 Settings config GUIs don't link to each other. You have to pull up separate GUIs for everything you want to tweak.
 There is no overall system config GUI in Linux. Yast is an exception, but only works for Opensuse. And it's apparently quite clunky.
 The system monitor offers less useful info than task manager
  
Are there any distros that might offer all of these features? And what other GUI-related things might Windows do better than Linux?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm a big fan of the BBC podcast In Our Time -- and (like most people) I've been playing with the OpenAI APIs.
In Our Time has almost 1,000 episodes on everything from Cleopatra to the evolution of teeth to plasma physics, all still available, so it's my starting point to learn about most topics. But it's not well organised.
So here are the episodes sorted by library code. It's fun to explore.
Web scraping is usually pretty tedious, but I found that I could send the minimised HTML to GPT-3 and get (almost) perfect JSON back: the prompt includes the Typescript definition.
At the same time I asked for a Dewey classification... and it worked. So I replaced a few days of fiddly work with 3 cents per inference and an overnight data run.
My takeaway is that I'll be using LLMs as function call way more in the future. This isn't "generative" AI, more "programmatic" AI perhaps?
So I'm interested in what temperature=0 LLM usage looks like (you want it to be pretty deterministic), at scale, and what a language that treats that as a first-class concept might look like.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Way back in 2009, we looked at the presto
plugin for yum, which added support for DeltaRPMs to Fedora.  That package
format allows just the binary differences (i.e. the delta) between an
installed RPM and its update to be transmitted, which saves network
bandwidth; the receiving system then 
creates the new RPM from those two pieces before installing it.  Support
for DeltaRPMs was eventually added to the distribution by default, though
the feature 
has never really lived up to expectations—and hopes.  Now, it would seem
that Fedora is ready to, in the words of project leader Matthew Miller,
"give DeltaRPMs a 
sad, fond farewell".]]></summary>

 I have been so fed up with windows lately but my favorite game (Genshin impact) Only runs on windows. I build PC's Have an older PC that I use specifically for that game now because I can't deal with all the windows bullcrap. Has Linux been a walk in the park..? relatively yeah actually, I have run into a few issues but they aren't so much issues as in learning a new OS which is actually super fun and rewarding. There's nothing like issuing a simple command for the first time on your own without even having been shown how. I know it's silly cuz I'm a Linux noob but I heard that $sudo apt install is the command for install, it just clicked for me and i opened terminal and typed in $sudo apt install terminator and sure enough it worked. Now this is literally NOTHING to any linux user but what it is for a newbie is a way to show how much more efficient using terminal is than your package installer and a great example to how everything works.
 The hardest part of the whole process was Balena Etcher corrupting my Samsung USB stick which happens often with samsungs so i Got a new stick and used rufus and there we go.

 this question sparked my interest because of a recent video from futo and talking about opensource and getting paid.

        <link href="https://www.williamlong.info/archives/7105.html"/>
        <updated>2023-03-08T12:11:11.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[TikTok宣布了一批新功能，旨在减少屏幕时间，提高年轻用户的幸福感。在未来几周，每天60分钟的屏幕时间限制将自动适用于每个18岁以下的TikTok用户。达到这一限制的青少年将被要求输入一个密码以继续观看，并且他们可以完全禁用该功能，但如果他们这样做，并且每天在TikTok上花费超过100分钟，他们会被要求设置新的限制。


TikTok称，在该功能测试的第一个月，这些提示使其屏幕时间管理工具的使用率提高了234%。青少年还将每周收到一个收件箱通知，回顾他们的屏幕时间，让年轻用户意识到他们在应用程序上花费了多少时间，并要求他们做出积极的决定，延长建议的屏幕时间。


TikTok说，在决定时间限制应该是多长时，它咨询了当前的学术研究和波士顿儿童医院数字健康实验室的专家。


TikTok信任和安全主管Cormac Keenan在一份声明中说："虽然对于多少屏幕时间是'太多'，甚至更广泛的屏幕时间的影响，没有一个集体认可的立场，但我们认识到，当青少年开始独立探索网络世界时，他们通常需要额外的支持。"


60分钟的时间限制也将适用于使用"TikTok for Younger Users"有限应用体验的13岁以下儿童。在这种情况下，如果达到屏幕时间限制，父母或监护人将需要设置或输入现有的密码，以启用账户上30分钟的额外观看时间。


家庭配对也增加了四个新功能，TikTok的可定制的家长控制，允许父母或监护人将他们的TikTok账户与年轻用户的账户联系起来。可以应用自定义限制，允许根据一周中的哪一天来调整限制（或在学校假期中更广泛地扩展）。


家庭配对还将允许访问TikTok的屏幕时间仪表板，该仪表板总结了孩子在该应用上花费的时间，打开的频率，以及详细说明白天和晚上花费的时间。一个新的"静音通知"设置将很快允许父母设置一个时间表，使他们孩子的账户上的应用程序通知静音。对于13至15岁的用户，推送通知已经从9点开始自动静音，而16-17岁的用户则从10点开始禁用推送通知。


最后，TikTok说它正在开发新的内容控制，允许照顾者过滤带有他们不想让孩子看的词语或标签的视频。该公司正在与"育儿、青年和民间社会组织"合作，在未来几周内设计这一功能。


在"家庭配对"之外，TikTok表示，其中一些设置将"很快"广泛提供给所有账户，允许任何用户安排静音通知，并为一周中的每一天设置自定义屏幕时间限制。睡眠提醒功能也正在推出，允许用户设置一个时间，以提醒他们关闭应用程序并上床睡觉。


TikTok没有透露今天宣布的新功能究竟何时会最终向用户推出。

之前，我们在 #926 中报道过，Meta 发布了能运行在单张显卡上的大语言模型 LLaMA。但 Meta 没有开源 LLaMA，而是通过邀请制的方式将源代码提供给选定的研究人员。不过很快，就有匿名用户通过 BT 种子 公开 了 LLaMA-65B，即有 650 亿个参数的 LLaMA，其容量为 220GB。它已被确认是真实的，已有用户在单张显卡上运行了 LLaMA，结果相当出色。尽管模型被泄露，Meta 公司说它将继续只与选定的研究人员分享 LLaMA。

老王点评：有一种猜测，LLaMA 模型被泄露是 Meta 故意或预料中的。




英特尔完成 1.8nm 和 2nm 生产节点的开发

据报道，英特尔已经完成了 18A（1.8 纳米级）和 20A（2 纳米级）制造工艺的开发。这并不意味着生产节点已经准备好用于商业制造，而是意味着英特尔已经确定了这两种技术的所有规格、材料、要求和性能目标。英特尔的 20A 制造技术将依靠全栅极 RibbonFET 晶体管，并将使用背面供电。预计 20A 将使英特尔超越该公司的竞争对手 —— 台积电和三星代工。英特尔计划在 2024 年上半年开始使用这一节点。

高通推出用来取代 eSIM 的 iSIM

高通公司表示，骁龙 8 代已经被认证为 “世界上第一个可商业化部署的 iSIM（集成 SIM）”。iSIM 是不断缩小 SIM 卡尺寸的下一步。eSIM 仍然是一个芯片，要占用你的主板空间，而 iSIM 是直接集成在 SoC 上的一个身份认证模块。SoC（片上系统）集成是使智能手机成为可能的技术，手机 SoC 芯片中集成了诸如 CPU、GPU、RAM、调制解调器和一些其他功能的上千个小芯片。


消息来源：Ars Technica



老王点评：我连 eSIM 都没用过呢，iSIM 就出来了。]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Linux 上的 dict 命令对作家来说非常有用，可以为他们的选词提供大量的字典和同义词。


作为一个作家，我经常需要确定单词的正确拼写或定义。我还需要使用词库来寻找替代词，这些词的内涵可能与我可能使用的词有些不同。因为我经常使用 Linux 命令行和文本模式工具来完成我的大部分工作，所以使用命令行词典是有意义的。

我非常喜欢使用命令行，原因有很多，其中最主要的原因是它对我来说更有效率。它也比任何一本或多本实体纸质字典，都要全面得多。我使用 Linux 的 dict 命令已经很多年了，我已经开始依赖它了。

在 Linux 上安装 dict

dict 程序在 Fedora 上没有默认安装，但它很容易安装。以下是如何在 Fedora 或类似发行版上安装：

$ sudo dnf install dictd


在 Debian 和类似发行版上，你还必须安装字典定义：

$ sudo apt install dictd dict-gcide


不需要额外的配置。这个非常简单的 /usr/share/doc/dictd/dict1.conf 文件指定了字典数据库的远程服务器。这个工具使用字典服务器协议（DICT），端口为 2628。

在 Linux 上使用 dict

在终端会话中，以非 root 用户的身份，输入 dict <word> 来获取一个或多个字典和词库的定义列表。例如，以这种方式查找 memory 这个词。

$ dict memory | less
6 definitions found

From The Collaborative International Dictionary of English v.0.48 [gcide]:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[NixOS……又一个使用不同软件包管理器的发行版？🤯

好吧，NixOS 是 高级 Linux 发行版 之一。

所以如果我写这个，我一定有一个充分的理由，对吗？嗯，有很多！

我已经使用它 3 个月了，它是如此之好，以至于我正在考虑从我一直以来最喜欢的 Pop!_OS 切换到 NixOS。

在本指南中，我将分享 NixOS 在众多 Linux 发行版中脱颖而出的主要特点。

别担心，在我们继续之前，让我告诉你什么是 NixOS：


它是一个以 Nix 包管理器为核心的 Linux 发行版，为你省去了在其它的 Linux 发行版上设置 Nix 的麻烦，可以让你充分利用它的优势。由开发 Nix 的同一个团队构建。


使用 NixOS 的 6 个理由

NixOS 是一个有趣的从零开始构建的 独立 Linux 发行版。

每个人都可以通过使用 NixOS 学到很多东西，但在我看来，如果你是一个开发人员或计算机科学的学生，NixOS 应该非常合适。



让我告诉你为什么。

1、不易损坏/易于恢复

就其核心而言，NixOS 是为长期使用而构建的。

这并不意味着它像 Debian 那样用多年前的软件包来保证稳定性，而是遵循一种不同的方法。

为了理解 NixOS 为何如此稳定，让我们谈谈用户一般是如何破坏他们的系统的，即“依赖性问题或软件包冲突”

在更新系统或安装一个新的软件包时，你一般会面临系统崩溃的风险。主要是因为你的软件包管理器无法满足依赖性，或者安装的软件包与现有系统冲突导致的。

而 NixOS 有一个非常聪明的方法来处理这个问题。

你看，每当你升级你的系统或安装一个软件包时，系统的状态就会被重建，被称为超过当前的“新世代new generation”。



因此，如果你在使用新的软件包或更新时遇到任何麻烦，…]]></summary>

顾若鹏（Barak Kushner）这个名字对于研究日本史的学者来说或许并不陌生。对日本美食感兴趣的读者不会忽略他的另一部著作——《拉面：食物里的日本史》（Slurp! a Social and Culinary History of Ramen，广西师范大学出版社，2019年）。2015年哈佛大学出版社出版了顾若鹏的《从人到鬼、从鬼到人：日本战犯与中国的审判》（Men to Devils, Devils to Men: Japanese War Crimes and Chinese Justice）一书，并于次年获得费正清奖（John K.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Correct me if I'm wrong, but Chrome OS is built upon the Linux kernel, just like any other Linux distro, correct?
 Moreover, I'm assuming Google Chrome on Chrome OS is the same build as Google Chrome on Linux, as well as the Widevine CDM is also the same on both.
 So then, why does one get special treatment on one and how come nobody figured out how to fool the CDM to report back to Netflix and make it look like the OS being run is Chrome OS, so that it also gets 1080p content as well?
 From what I read online, the only way for Netflix to deliver 1080p content to your Google Chrome browser is if you're running Widevine L1, which implies that there's hardware level decryption inside a Trusted Execution Environment (like using Intel Management Engine or such).
 But, as far as I know, Linux doesn't make use of Intel ME features to protect content, so there's no way for this to work. If Google implemented changes to the kernel to provide this protection, couldn't anyone request the patches, seeing how the Linux kernel is GPL-ed so anyone can see how they're doing it? If they did, those patches could easily be integrated into the mainline kernel to give any distro the possibility to protect content and become L1-capable.
 Basically, what I'm asking is, how does Chrome OS protect content when it's open source while other distros cannot?

 Install 'clai' via 'pipx install clai', or from the repo here: https://github.com/apockill/clai
 Add the following to your '~/.profile':export SHIN_DEFAULT_COMMAND="clai"export OPENAI_API_TOKEN={your token here}
  
Next steps are to set it up so it (optionally) reads the contents of the current window and gives that as context to the LLM. Here's hoping we get open source chatbots soon so this sort of thing can run locally!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm a huge fan of self-hosting using my own hardware, and I always use AlmaLinux or some other RHEL variant. I especially self-host a growing media library of shows and movies. So naturally, I went out and bought a used Wyse 5070 recently to help with the process of transcoding incoming media.
 I eventually ended up going down a bit of a rabbit hole the other day when I tried to get hardware-based video transcoding to work, mostly because I don't want my media library to grow unchecked. And also partly because the Roku in my living room is old and basically only supports H.264.
 After all was said and done, I got it working, and it surprisingly turned out to be quite a little powerhouse and a welcome addition to my media transcoding setup.
 I wanted to share my experience with anyone who's interested in this type of thing. Hopefully it helps inspire someone else to go through the trouble of getting hardware transcoding to work on a RHEL-based Linux distro!
 The write-up ended up being a little lengthy, so I threw it into a GitHub Gist.
 Here's the link to the post, let me know your thoughts!

A few days ago I saw a graph[0] that showed the # of job postings on HN was declining. I started wondering what other trends I could glean from the data, so I created this!
You can filter through the top level comments by keyword; for example you can filter by "remote" to see the massive spike around March 2020. Another interesting thing I found is that I can compare hiring across cities.
I hope you enjoy! I made it so that the links to your search are sharable so if you have some interesting data you should be able to just link the page you're on!

Energy (BLE). Their data is easy to receive, but decoding it can be a
challenge. Each manufacturer uses its own format, often tied to its own
mobile apps. Integrating all of these sensors into a home-automation system
requires a lot of custom decoders, which are generally developed by
reverse-engineering  
the protocols. The goal of the BTHome
project is to change this: it offers a standardized format for sensors to
broadcast their measurements using BLE. BTHome is supported by the Home 
Assistant

DAGWorks is based on Hamilton, an open-source project that we created and recently forked (https://github.com/dagworks-inc/hamilton). Hamilton is a set of high-level conventions for Python functions that can be automatically converted into working ETL pipelines. To that, we're adding a closed-source offering that goes a step further, plugging these functions into a wide array of production ML stacks.
ML pipelines consist of computational steps (code + data) that produce a working statistical model that a business can use. A typical pipeline might be (1) pull raw data (Extract), (2) transform that…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[苹果公司已经批准了一项电子邮件应用程序的更新，此前，该软件中使用由人工智能驱动的语言工具的一项功能被质疑是否会产生对儿童不合适的内容进行审查。据应用程序开罚商Blix Inc.的联合创始人Ben Volach称，该应用程序BlueMail在其开发商保证其具有内容控制功能后获得批准。


《华尔街日报》周四报道说，由于苹果要求该应用程序增加内容控制或限制在17岁及以上，该更新包括一个由语言聊天机器人ChatGPT提供的新功能，因此被搁置。此前，该应用程序适用于4岁及以上年龄段。


Blix告诉苹果，其更新包括内容控制，并建议该公司公开任何有关在应用程序中使用ChatGPT或其他类似人工智能系统的新政策。周四晚上，BlueMail的更新被批准，应用本身没有任何改动，该应用程序仍然适用于4岁及以上的用户。


苹果公司没有对评论请求作出回应。


BlueMail的新功能调用了OpenAI的ChatGPT，这是一个能够回答问题或写短文的人工智能系统，主要功能是利用以前的电子邮件和日历事件的内容帮助自动撰写电子邮件。


苹果公司最初拒绝BlueMail的ChatGPT功能的消息，凸显了人们对语言生成的人工智能工具的新用途越来越关注。ChatGPT允许用户与一个看起来像人类的人工智能对话，但早期测试显示人工智能产生了错误的信息以及奇怪的、有时是敌对的反应。


虽然苹果对人工智能功能采取了行动，但苹果没有就应用程序中使用所谓的生成性人工智能制定更多正式的应用程序商店指南。


苹果公司长期以来一直表示，它必须对通过其应用程序商店的每个应用程序进行策划和审查，以保证其产品对用户的安全。

研究人员宣布了一项重大的网络安全发现，一个被称之为 BlackLotus 的恶意软件可以劫持计算机的启动过程，即使启用了安全启动和其他先进的保护措施。这是世界上发现的第一个此类恶意软件的真实实例。BlackLotus 是一个 UEFI 启动套件，可以劫持 UEFI 的工作。UEFI 本身就是一个操作系统，在电脑开机后首先运行，它位于一个焊接在计算机主板上的闪存芯片中，这使得它很难被检查或修补。BlackLotus 利用了一个 Windows 的安全漏洞，一旦成功植入，这个 UEFI 启动包将禁用操作系统的安全机制，使计算机被隐蔽感染，即使在重新安装操作系统或更换硬盘后也无法清除。

老王点评：虽然一直理论上猜测会有突破安全启动机制的恶意软件，但是真没想到就这样出现了，而且已经在地下市场售卖了一段时间。




OpenAI 并没有想到 ChatGPT 会如此成功

当 OpenAI 在 2022 年 11 月发布 ChatGPT 时，它并没有预料到这个 AI 聊天机器人会取得难以想象的成功。OpenAI 内部将之视为研究预览，旨在收集公众的反馈以消除部分缺陷。ChatGPT 使用的技术都不是新的，ChatGPT 使用的是发布于 2022 年 1 月的 GPT-3.5，而 GPT-3.5 是 2020 年发布的 GPT-3 的更新版。

老王点评：虽然困惑于 ChatGPT 如此成功，但是这不妨碍 OpenAI 迅速利用它的成功推动发展。




谷歌的 1000 种语言的人工智能模型迈出关键一步

去年 11 月，谷歌宣布其计划创建一个支持世界上 1000 种最常用语言的语言模型，同时还披露了其通用语音模型（USM）。周一，谷歌披露了 USM 的更多信息，称其是创建该语言模型迈出的 “关键性的第一步”。谷歌将 USM 描述为 “一个最先进的语音模型系列”，它有 20 亿个参数，经过了 1200 万小时的语音和超过 300 种语言的 280 亿个句子的训练。USM 已经被 YouTube 用来生成封闭式字幕，支持超过 100 种语言，并将作为基础来建立一个更加广泛的系统。


消息来源：The Verge



老王点评：可能很快全球各地的人用语言互相交流将不再是问题。]]></summary>

最近，我受邀介绍网络上可用的免费和开放资源。这次演讲是当地为保持我们社区的正常运转而做出的部分尝试 —— 由我家附近的 圣文德大学St. Bonaventure University Foster Center 赞助。 我分享的一些资源不是开源的而是免费的，但许多工具是开源的。

看到有不少人知道我所提到的工具真的很有趣。很多人并不知道他们每天使用的工具都是开源的，并且他们还可以与他人分享。

开源浏览器

使用网络需要一个好的浏览器，而 Firefox 是开源的，这一点很多在场的人并不清楚。除了是开源，Firefox 还具有强烈的隐私意识，这是许多用户越来越关注的问题。不过，有趣的是，即使是微软的新浏览器也是基于开源 Chromium 项目的。

开源网络隐私

通常，保护你的隐私和改善你的网络体验的另一种方法是使用 uBlock Origin 来阻止广告。根据他们的网站：


uBlock Origin 是一个免费、开源、跨平台的内容过滤浏览器扩展——主要旨在以一种高效、用户友好的方法消除隐私侵犯。


其代码采用 GPL v. 3.0 许可证。

电子前沿基金会Electronic Frontier Foundation（EFF）还维护 Privacy Badger———— 这是一个根据 GPL v.3.0 许可的网络浏览器扩展程序。根据他们的 GitHub 存储库，它是：


一个可以自动学习阻止隐形的跟踪器的浏览器扩展程序。Privacy Badger 没有一个要阻止的列表，而是根据它们的行为自动发现跟踪器。


除了隐私之外，我的演讲还分享了安全密码的重要性。我的听众了解到了 Bitwarden。许多人不知道如何生成安全密码、区分不同网站的密码以及如何安全地存储它们。…]]></summary>

对中国人来说，巴基斯坦是电视新闻里最高频的外国国名之一，但作为旅行目的地在周边国家中却可能排在最末。巴基斯坦的政治不稳定并非始于、更非源于“反恐战争”，但二十一世纪初发生在邻国阿富汗的战争显然加剧了不稳定状况在巴基斯坦许多层面与许多地方的恶化。如今的巴基斯坦，不只在中国大众心目中，很可能在世界大多数地区的大多数人心目中，都是既混乱又遥远、既危险又神秘的奇妙组合。二十多年来，外国人所写的有关巴基斯坦的畅销英文读物，其作者几乎全都是记者和研究者，比如Owen Bennett Jones（著有Pakistan: Eye of the Storm）和Anatol Lieven（著有Pakistan: A Hard Country），而且都聚焦于政治。当然，这种倾向自1980年代以来愈加明显，引人注目的作者如Emma Duncan（著有Breaking the Curfew: A Political Journey Through Pakistan），以及Christina Lamb（著有Waiting for Allah: Pakistan’s Struggle for Democracy），都擅长政治观察与记录。以前那种在巴基斯坦凝视自然、体验社会文化的旅行作家，如Dervla Murphy（著有Where the Indus Is Young: A Winter in Baltistan），似乎突然绝迹了。也许这种变化是巴基斯坦局势的正常反映。正是在这个意义上，伊桑巴德·威尔金森（Isambard Wilkinson）出版于2017年的《巴基斯坦寻根之旅》非常难得，值得推荐。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[年前，拙编《程应镠学记》（浙江古籍出版社，2022年）出版，“评论”辑收录了周一良先生致程应镠先生（笔名流金）的一通函札，是他读了流金师《南北朝史话》赠书的来信。我代拟了《〈南北朝史话〉读后的零碎意见》的篇名，在《后记》里说：“周一良先生那篇录自来函手迹，出自专家的评论尤应值得一提”。这通信函最先刊于拙编《程应镠先生编年事辑》（上海人民出版社，2016年），《编年事辑》还引用了先师庋藏的一良先生的其他函件。目前收集最齐、由赵和平编的《周一良全集》出版在《编年事辑》前，故其书信部分未能将这些逸信辑入。今年恰逢周一良先生诞生百十周年，遂以流金藏札中周一良来函为中心，对有关背景与史事试作解读，意在勾沉两位前辈学者的学术交谊。
一
现存流金藏札中周先生的最早来函就是这封评论《南北朝史话》的信札，竖写在两张白纸上，全文如下：
应镠同志:
前承枉驾，适值外出，失迎至歉！钟翰兄送来大著，至深感谢。拜读之后，感到此书深入浅出，准确鲜明生动兼而有之，确实不可多得。说明您多年儧揅，积累富厚，脱稿十五年才得出版，亦足以告慰吴晗同志于地下!
读后有点零碎意见，不知当否，录供参考。
P11，“地方武力打败中央武力，这在南朝还是第一次。”南朝篡夺政权者，大都先经营其根据地，如刘裕之京口，肖【萧】道成之淮阴，肖【萧】衍之襄阳。迫近篡位之前，又往往先入建康，控制扬州，刘裕、肖【萧】道成皆如此。“第一次”提法似欠周密。
P21，“象蝇拂”，麈尾不是象蝇拂（或云帚），而是类似羽扇，日本正仓院尚存实物，敦煌壁画中维摩诘手中所执亦是扇状。
P55，“北魏称赫连氏为屈丐”，当是称赫连勃勃为屈丐，而不是整个赫连氏。
P85、陶俑图中“鲜卑服”，似是当时之“袴褶”，而汉服佣高髻耸立，恐是妇女，如此对照恐不尽恰当。
P104、五五七年当作五七七年。
书中对北魏统治者如道武、孝文帝等皆有肯定地方，于南朝的皇帝则一律否定，似…]]></summary>

（LCTT 校注：原文发表于 2 年前， 但时至今日仍然有一些值得了解的信息。）

全世界都在推行开源软件（OSS）理念，所以开源软件的安全也至关重要。为了提升开源软件的安全性，业界已经做了大量工作，并取得了一些成果。这些成果包括：Linux 基金会的 核心基础设施计划Core Infrastructure Initiative（CII）、GitHub 安全实验室的 开源安全联盟Open Source Security Coalition（OSSC）和由谷歌以及其他公司创立的 联合开源软件计划Joint Open Source Software Initiative（JOSSI）。

显然，如果这些成果合为一体，软件行业将发展得更加顺利。这三项成果在 2020 年合并为“旨在促进开源软件安全性的、由各行业巨头主导的跨行业联盟”。

OpenSSF 的确受益于这种“跨行业联盟”；它有几十个成员，（按字母顺序）包括 Canonical、 GitHub、谷歌、IBM、英特尔、微软和红帽。联盟的理事会成员还包括安全社区个人代表，这些个人代表是那些不能以企业名义作为联盟成员的个人。该联盟也创造了一些便于人们合作的组织结构：建立一些活跃的工作组，这种工作组确定（并公布）它存在的价值，其中的成员应当就该组织的技术愿景形成一致意见。

但是这并不重要，除非它们有实际成果。当时虽然处于早期，它们也确实取得了一些成果。它们发布了：


安全软件开发基础课程：在 edX 平台上有 3 门免费课程，旨在教授软件开发人员软件安全方面的知识。这些课程注重实际操作，任何开发人员都可以较轻松地学习，而不是那些需要耗费大量资源的理论…]]></summary>

 I broke my Manjaro-kde. I love Manjaro-kde, but, now that I'm not fettered to it (since I broke it (don't ask lol)) should I go with tumbleweed? 
 I've used Linux since 1998, stuck with kubuntu for many years. Almost went with tumbleweed but for one little program couldn't use, loved it otherwise. Then have stuck with Manjaro-kde for the last several years. I've always had that little desire to try tumbleweed again, especially since that one program is no longer a necessity. 
 So, what say you group, tumbleweed better than Manjaro?

We’re building Vellum (https://www.vellum.ai), a developer platform for building on LLMs like OpenAI’s GPT-3 and Anthropic’s Claude. We provide tools for efficient prompt engineering, semantic search, performance monitoring, and fine-tuning, helping you bring LLM-powered features from prototype to production.
The MLOps industry has matured rapidly for traditional ML (typically open-source models hosted in-house), but companies using LLMs are suffering from a lack of tooling to support things like experimentation, version control, and monitoring. They’re forced to build these tools themselves, taking valuable engineering time away from their core product.

With Sorbay, you can easily record your screen, camera, and microphone all at once. It is a complete solution that comes with its own backend service, allowing you to instantly share a link of your recording as soon as it is finished. The video is streamed directly to the backend service as the recording happens to make this possible.
With both founders based in different countries, we needed a tool to quickly share screen recordings to keep us up to date or to ask for feedback. Meetings are cool if you need to discuss something deeply, but for almost everything else a quick recording works better.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A few months ago, I benchmarked FastAPI on an i9 MacBook Pro. I couldn't believe my eyes. A primary REST endpoint to `sum` two integers took 6 milliseconds to evaluate. It is okay if you are targeting a server in another city, but it should be less when your client and server apps are running on the same machine.
FastAPI would have bottleneck-ed the inference of our lightweight UForm neural networks recently trending on HN under the title "Beating OpenAI CLIP with 100x less data and compute". (Thank you all for the kind words!) So I wrote another library.
