        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have a buddy of mine who needs an upgrade. He's still running Windows 7. His family doesn't want to upgrade ( Members of the cult of Windows 7) but I can't in good conscience continue to let this man use window 7, Especially with his bank account, with its wild security vulnerabilities. I'm considering upgrading the man to a Linux system, but he has little to no computing experience. He refers to himself as "The troglodyte" and is mostly not that interested in learning. 
 Another issue is that this machine will be shared with his family, and his mother in particular is a MASSIVE Conspiracy Theorist. On 1 hand, that helps limit the damage she can do with viruses. (She infects the thing about once a week visiting who knows what conspiracy sites. I'm amazed the thing still functions) On the other, I shudder to think what this woman can do with the power of The terminal. One "Do you want to stop the intergalactic lizard space aliens from being able to read your mind? Simply input this into your terminal!" could wreck the entire system. With no recourse beyond a full reinstall. 
 Is there any distro, or anything, that I could do/recommend that could possibly help them? Something very beginner friendly. Would it be possible for me to disable the terminal, to minimize the damage that could be done, and still have a usable experience? Before continuing I would be sure to verify it with them. I'm not one of THOSE Linux guys That would swap an entire system's OS without telling them and getting permission. The thing is absolutely ancient and borderline unusable in its current state, So I wouldn't be hurting anything by potentially switching it over. Trying to help the guy out, and weighing my choices. I have rudimentary Linux experience, and would be able to help at the beginning if need be, which I'm sure it would be. That's one advantage I didn't have starting out. Any advice, or is this just too risky of a thing to do?

 I'm hoping this is the best place to post this, if not, please let me know where would be better.
 I was working on a Linux website host server years ago, and my boss hired some people in another country to work overnight. When a freshman couldn't get access to something (that he didn't know he didn't need), he ended up using sudo (not my decision to allow them to do that) to give himself all permissions to all files starting from the root directory.
 When I got a call in the morning from my boss (who's head I could hear crackling from the fire burning through his hair) saying that everything was down, I came in and tried to fix anything. When I realized what happened, I decided it would be less worth t…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I ran the linpeas script on my system, out of curiosity, to check for possible PE exploits from my guest accounts. I understood most of what it reported back to me, fixed a couple of permission mistakes. But it also reported alerts on several 'writable listeners'. These were from legit core packages like systemd or nvidia.
 For example the sockets it referenced as Writable were /run/libvirt/libvirt-sock and /run/nvidia-xdriver-1e20223d and a couple of others (jackctl, pcscd,...).
 My question is why is a writable socket that these packages create considered a vulnerability? Should I do something about these? Aren't the sockets supposed to be writable (even by different users) to allow for process communication?

        <link href="https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/zauqxt/linux_outofmemory_killer_oom_killer/"/>
        <updated>2022-12-02T19:15:23.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Linux kernel has a mechanism called “out-of-memory killer” (aka OOM killer) which is used to recover memory on a system. The OOM killer allows killing a single task (called also oom victim) while that task will terminate in a reasonable time and thus free up memory. 
 When OOM killer does its job we can find indications about that by searching the logs (like /var/log/messages and grepping for “Killed”). If you want to configure the “OOM killer” I suggest reading the following link https://www.oracle.com/technical-resources/articles/it-infrastructure/dev-oom-killer.html. 
 It is important to understand that the OOM killer chooses between processes based on the “oom_score”. If you want to see the value for a specific process we can just read “/proc/[PID]/oom_score” - as shown in the screenshot below. If we want to alter the score we can do it using “/proc/[PID]/oom_score_adj” - as shown also in the screenshot below. The valid range is from 0 (never kill) to 1000 (always kill), the lower the value is the lower is the probability the process will be killed. For more information please read https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man5/proc.5.html. 
 In the next post I am going to elaborate about the kernel thread “oom_reaper”. See you in my next post ;-)

 My friend and I started college this year. He is studying physical therapy and I, computer science. I have used Linux (mainly Ubuntu) for a few years on secondary machines (and on my steam deck if you count that). So I have some experience with Linux, but my friend doesn't.
 ​
 So it was our first day of class, and my friend called me and told me that his laptop wasn't working. He had intro assignments due that night and needed to use his computer, as it was his only machine at that point. Well, for whatever reason, the windows install was borked, and he didn't have any important data, so I went to reinstall windows (from a USB stick). When doing this, I kept getting the error that the installer didn't have the right drivers to recognize his SSD. I could have futzed around…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The software-interrupt mechanism is one of the oldest parts in the kernel;
arguably, the basic design behind it predates Linux itself.  Software
interrupts can get in the way of other work so, for almost as
long as they have existed, developers have wished that they
could be made to go away.  That has never happened, though, and doesn't
look imminent. Instead, Android systems have long carried a patch that
tries to minimize the impact of software interrupts, at least in some
situations.  John Stultz is now posting
that work, which contains contributions from a number of authors, in
the hope of getting it into the mainline kernel.]]></summary>

 Here is summary of it's features:
  
Works on Linux, Mac OS X, Windows, FreeBSD and most popular Unix-like systems.
 Outputs beautiful, semantic colors by default.
 Show paths to symlinks, and explicitly show broken links.
 Recurse down sub-directories.
 Emojis (if you're into that) and Nerd Fonts.
 Supports producing structured JSON and CSV output (to use with jq or similar tools). I was inspired by nushell.
 Full flexibility in choosing which columns / information to show.
 Support correct handling of CJK and other wide or invisible Unicode characters in tabular format.
 Better default sorting (by basename then extension) and 8 custom sorting methods (more than ls, although lacking a few of ls sorting methods).
 Support several formats for time, along with custom Unix's time format (all compatible with ls).
 Support several formats for file sizes (all compatible with ls).
 High compatibility with ls command's flags.
 Ability to customize colors with an environment variable.

    图片截取自官方宣传片 The Official Mascot of the FIFA World Cup Qatar 2022™

馄饨皮、饺子皮、小精灵…… 这至少是中文互联网对于 2022 卡塔尔世界杯吉祥物印象。虽然这样说有些戏谑，但至少说明这个吉祥物给大家留下了非常深刻印象。不过只从吉祥物身上看 2022 届卡塔尔世界杯的视觉形象设计或许有些以偏概全了，毕竟除了吉祥物之外，还有 Logo、门票、字体、配色、电视中的视觉组成一个完整的视觉形象。那么本期的持续更新，和大家分享一下 2022 卡塔尔世界杯在吉祥物、字体和 Logo 设计上的巧思和批判。对了，在阅读之前推荐大家去世界杯官网上看一下吉祥物和 Logo 的设计。
馄饨皮：世界杯吉祥物中的少数派，手法独到且有差异性

    开幕式上的「馄饨皮」 图片来源

在微博上看到大家叫它「馄饨皮」之前我并没有真正观察过卡塔尔世界杯的任何设计。实际上，我第一次看到 La'eeb 的时候并不觉得他像馄饨皮，而是更像可爱的幽灵，因为无论是 Emoji、任天堂、万圣节等等活动中，大家都会把白色、无腿、大眼睛这些元素用在幽灵身上。这让我想到，大家认为 La'eeb 像馄饨皮的原因其实是文化差异：我们的生活环境中很少有人带这样的头饰，更没有见过未佩戴在头上的样子，比如我就以为这块布并不是正方形的，而开幕式上 La'eeb 出场的样子是白白净净方方正正，生活中拥有这样特征的就是馄饨皮和饺子皮了。
让我们摆正姿态再认识一下它：La'eeb，拉伊卜，样貌极具辨识度和话题性。它不仅是一个很可爱且吸睛的吉祥物，也是在世界杯中差异性做的最好的吉祥物之一，并且它是组成本次世界杯视觉设计「民族性」的重要一环。让我们先看看他的由来。

谷歌称，“在过去几年/版本中，内存安全漏洞的数量大幅下降。”每年的内存安全漏洞数量从 2019 年的 223 个下降到 2022 年的 85 个。Android 13 是第一个该版本中加入的大部分新代码都是内存安全语言的安卓版本，Rust 在 Android 13 所有新的原生代码中占 21%。在整个 Android 12 和 13 系统中，“在安卓的 Rust 代码中发现的内存安全漏洞为零”。

老王点评：这是 Rust 在产品领域很具有说服力的证明。




OpenAI 的新聊天机器人可以解释代码

OpenAI 发布了一个通用的聊天机器人原型 ChatGPT，可以以更像人类的方式和用户对话。虽然这种聊天机器人本质上是 “随机鹦鹉”，它们的知识仅仅来自于训练数据中的统计规律，而不是像人类那样对世界这个复杂而抽象的系统的理解。但有人用编码问题测试了它，并声称其答案是完美的。比如说，它会说“你使用的那个循环条件犯了一个严重的错误！”或者可以让它像一个聪明的黑客一样解释冒泡排序算法。


消息来源：The Verge



老王点评：能解释代码其实并不令人意外，要是能进一步可以帮忙审查代码就更好了。




英国年龄超过 50 岁的 IT 专家仅有 22% 

根据英国计算机协会的研究，在当地 190 万 IT 专家中，只有 22%（41.3 万）达到或超过 50 岁，而英国其他就业领域中 50 岁以上的平均人数约为 56.1万。另外，老年技术人员的时薪中位数为 25 英镑，比整个 IT 专家群体的时薪高 14%。

老王点评：看来 IT 还是吃青春饭的比较多，而且老了不值钱。

墓志，以及其他类型的石刻，承载着丰富的历史信息，是研究者不可忽视的资料。在西魏北周史研究中，传世文献的稀少使得墓志的价值更加凸显。利用墓志进行研究，首先需要掌握检索方法，了解研究时段内墓志的存佚状况，以免因失检导致研究不尽周详。碑志目录、索引以及石刻数据库能够帮助研究者在较短时间内将所需材料大致搜罗齐备。刘琴丽编《汉魏六朝隋碑志索引》（中国社会科学出版社2019年版）是目前收录唐以前碑志数目最多的石刻检索工具书。据该书统计，截至2017年底，各种出版物中所见西魏碑志共计五十二种，北周碑志共计二百零五种。据笔者不完全统计，2017年以来出版的石刻图录及期刊文章中又见西魏墓志九种、北周墓志二十八种。尽管石刻收藏与考古发现的陆续公布使西魏北周墓志的可知数量继续增长，但与东魏北齐墓志的已知数量相比，西魏北周墓志可以说是少得可怜。这一现象或许不能简单视为“幸存者偏差”，其背后的历史原因有待探寻。好在，可资西魏北周史研究的墓志不仅限于西魏北周纪年墓志。隋代乃至唐贞观以前的墓志，都是西魏北周史研究中需要留意的资料。

自传统金石学至现代石刻研究，学界对墓志的考察不断深入。孙正军总结出近年来中古碑志研究的六个新动向：一是谱系的发现及建构过程之探讨；二是碑志的历史书写与“异刻”研究；三是碑志的个体生命史研究；四是碑志的历史记忆研究；五是碑志的政治景观研究；六是碑志所见地域社会史研究。（孙正军：《近十年来中古碑志研究的新动向》，《史学月刊》2021年第4期。作者在此文中首先提出了一、二、五三个动向。在2022年10月29日由复旦大学历史学系主办的“碑之转身·中古中国石碑与石刻文化学术研讨会”上，作者提交的会议论文以《近年来中古碑志研究的新动向》为题，文中提出三、四两个新动向。第六个新动向乃笔者亲承赐示，在此…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[多文本交织的个体生命史
近年来以碑志为主要资料的个体生命史研究，多关注“边缘人”的历史。这些“边缘人”在传世文献中籍籍无名，出土材料有助于还原他们的生平，使后人得以了解以往不为人知的人生。然而，包括墓志在内，中国古代关于个人生平的资料，几乎都是基于个人在政治体中的地位和作用形成的。政治体内部的中心与边缘，是多重而相对的，上至皇帝下至奴隶，所有人的生命历程都被打碎，融入线性的历史叙事中，个体生命沦为历史事件的注脚，每个人都难免在历史文本中沦为边缘人（例如皇帝作为储君时的经历，一般不会详细保留在本纪中，因为本纪中的皇帝是在位年代的代名词）。整合零散的文本，还原被政治身份定义、被政治时间打碎的人生，在以个人生活为中心的叙事框架中重新发现历史细节，以及从前未曾引人注目的联系，或许有助于让个体生命史研究获得超越个案积累的意义。以下试以元罗为例，还原在文本边缘游走的人生。
元罗是北魏江阳王元继次子，亦即孝明帝朝权臣元叉之弟。其人一生转仕北魏、西魏、萧梁、侯景与北周，事迹散见魏、梁、周、齐诸书，南、北二史甚至《隋书》。南北朝后期政局变动频繁，转投他国避难者不在少数，但未有如元罗一样能在五个政权保持名位不堕的人。元罗的行迹决定其生平资料的多源性，史料的多源反过来又使得后世对元罗的了解呈现为零星的碎片。填补诸家史籍的叙事缝隙，描绘元罗相对完整的人生图景，本就是有价值的史学工作。然而，囿于集团、群体研究的偏好，现代学者多将元罗视作入梁元魏皇族的一员（综述见张宇阳：《入梁之元魏皇族研究》，扬州大学硕士学位论文，2017年），或将其经历作为北周优待元魏宗室的例证（王永平：《北朝后期元魏皇族人物之境遇》，《社会科学战线》2017年第8期），未将其生平作为个案进行研究。笔者认为，萧梁不可能对来奔的元魏宗室秉持一视同仁的政策，北周亦不会优容所有拓跋家人，而是根据他们各自的利用价值与威胁程度区别对待。去除…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Git 的 bisect 工具通过快速识别坏的提交，节省了时间和精力。


你是不是有过这样的经历：发现代码中有 错误bug，但不知道这个错误是什么时候引入的。这有可能是因为，某个人提交了一份有错误的代码，但没有在他的 Git 提交commit 消息中声明它。这个错误可能已经存在了几周、几个月甚至几年，这意味着你需要搜索数百或数千个提交，才能找到问题何时出现的。而 git bisect 命令能够完美地解决这个问题！

git bisect 命令是一个强大的工具。你可以给 git bisect 命令一个范围，一端是一个已知的好状态，另一端是一个已知的坏状态。它会自动地确认当前范围的中点，在这个中点上进行测试，然后要求你确定那次提交是一个 好提交good commit 还是一个 坏提交bad commit，然后它会重复这一“二分查找”的过程，直到你找到首次引入错误的那一次提交。



这个“数学”工具是利用“二分查找”来找到错误之处的。git bisect 命令通过查看中点，然后由你来决定它是提交列表的新起点（即 “坏提交” ）还是新终点（即 “好提交”），进而来缩小查找范围，如此在几次查找中你可以就能定位到有错误的提交。即使你有 10,000 个提交要检查，最多只需要 13 次查找，就能很快地定位到首次引入错误的提交。


提交 1 坏 <> 提交 10,000 好 => 提交 5,000 是坏的

提交 5,000 坏 <> 提交 10,000 好 => 提交 7,500 是好的

提交 5,000 坏 <> 提交 7,500 好 => 提交 6,250 是好的

提交 5,000 坏 <> 提交 6,250 好 => 提交 5,625 是坏的

提交 5,625 坏 <> 提交 6,250 好 => 提交 5,938 是坏的

提交 5,938 坏 <> 提交 6,250 好 => 提交 6,094 是好的

提交 5,938 坏 <> 提交 6,094 好 => 提交 6,016 是坏的

提交 6,016 坏 <> 提交 6,094 好 => 提交 6,055 是好的

提交 6,016 坏 <> 提交 6,055 好 => 提交 6,036 是坏的

提交 6,036 坏 <> 提交 6,055 好 => 提交 6,046 是坏的

提交 6,046 坏 <> 提交 6,055 好 => 提交 6,050 是坏的

提交 6,050 坏 <> 提交 6,055 好 => 提交 6,053 是好的

提交 6,053 坏 <> 提交 6,055 好 => 提交 6,054 是好的


对于上面这个例子，我们能知道 10,000 个提交中的第一个错误提交是第 6053 次提交。对于 git bisect 命令，最多需要几分钟就能完成检索。但是如果要一个一个查找每个提交是否错误，我甚至无法想象需要多长时间。

使用 Git bisect 命令

git bisect 命令使用起来非常简单：

（LCTT 译注：使用 git bisect start 命令来进入 bisect 模式，并且该命令指定了一个检查范围。它会告诉我们一共有多少次提交，大概需要几步就可以定位到具体的提交。）

$ git bisect start
$ git bisect bad        # Git assumes you mean HEAD by default
$ git bisect good <ref> # specify a tag or commit ID for <ref>


Git 检查中间的提交，并等待你声明这次提交是一个好提交还是一个坏提交：

（LCTT 译注：如果某一提交是可以通过的，则使用 git bisect good 命令标记；同样地，如果某一提交不能通过，则使用 git bisect bad 命令标记。）

$ git bisect good


或

$ git bisect bad


然后，git bisect 工具重复检查好提交和坏提交中间的那次提交，直到你告诉它：

$ git bisect reset


一些高级用户甚至可以自己编写脚本，来确定提交的好坏状态、并在找到特定提交时采取某一补救措施。你可能不会每天都使用 git bisect 命令，但当你需要它来定位首次引入错误的提交时，它会是一个很有用的救星。

 I've always wanted a Linux tablet. So I got one. It's a generic rebranded tablet called a RuggedPC Rugged82. Its similar to the Vanquisher 8in on Amazon. The tablet I got came from old warehouse surplus. 
 I'd like to share my journey on this project. So buckle up. 
 First of all, I could get only 2 distros to boot on it. I'm still old school so the new art of EFI boot files... If it was up to me, lilo and the MBR would still be around as the standard, but we aren't in the 90s anymore. So maybe this part was my struggle. Either way the two distros were antiX and MX Linux and handled configuring the efi boot perfectly. 
 antiX is a fine distro for old systems. Far better than any "light distro" on the net today. "Light distros" are not light a…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Over on the Google security blog, Jeffrey Vander Stoep writes about the impact of focusing on using memory-safe languages for new code in Android.

As the amount of new memory-unsafe code entering Android has decreased, so too has the number of memory safety vulnerabilities. From 2019 to 2022 it has dropped from 76% down to 35% of Android’s total vulnerabilities. 2022 is the first year where memory safety vulnerabilities do not represent a majority of Android’s vulnerabilities. 

While correlation doesn’t necessarily mean causation, it’s interesting to note that the percent of vulnerabilities caused by memory safety issues seems to correlate rather closely with the development language that’s used for new code. This matches the expectations published in our blog post 2 years ago about the age of memory safety vulnerabilities and why our focus should be on new code, not rewriting existing components. Of course there may be other contributing factors or alternative explanations. However, the shift is a major departure from industry-wide trends that have persisted for more than a decade (and likely longer) despite substantial investments in improvements to memory unsafe languages.

 2 of these disks died and I don't intend to replace them, so I want to scale down the array to 2x2TB disks
 I removed both devices from the mdadm array, but I'm still seeing this when I run mdadm --detail /dev/md0
 I just can't seem to find a way to remove the "disk" with a "removed" state
 root@parents-server:/mnt# mdadm --detail /dev/md0 /dev/md0: Version : 1.2 Creation Time : Wed Jul 20 22:22:27 2022 Raid Level : raid1 Array Size : 1953382400 (1862.89 GiB 2000.26 GB) Used Dev Size : 1953382400 (1862.89 GiB 2000.26 GB) Raid Devices : 3 Total Devices : 2 Persistence : Superblock is persistent Intent Bitmap : Internal Update Time : Thu Dec 1 22:28:50 2022 State : clean, degraded Active Devices : 2 Working Devices : 2 Failed Devices : 0 Spare Devices : 0 Consistency Policy : bitmap Name : parents-server:0 (local to host parents-server) UUID : 64c7435f:85a7e90d:25c09e71:0f128cbe Events : 182112 Number Major Minor RaidDevice State - 0 0 0 removed 1 8 49 1 active sync /dev/sdd1 2 8 65 2 active sync /dev/sde1 
 
 EDIT: Fixed it
 https://serverfault.com/questions/554553/how-to-delete-removed-devices-from-a-mdadm-raid1
 mdadm --grow /dev/md1 --raid-devices=3 
 So in my case it was
 mdadm --grow /dev/md0 --raid-devices=2 
 Even though it's not "growing" it still set it to 2 disks

Think of Nihongo Lessons as the textbook to Nihongo’s dictionary. It’s an app for learning Japanese, specifically made for learners who are serious about becoming fluent, and want a guided set of content that will help them efficiently acquire vocabulary and grammar.
The project came about when Adam Shapiro of Japanese Level Up (Jalup) [1] announced last April that he was shutting Jalup down. As a fan of Adam’s work I was bummed to hear the news, but realized I actually might be one of the few people in the world in a position to keep his work alive. So I reached out, and we came up with a deal where I would sell Jalup content in …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have become very interested in this lately as I recently went through hell with my computer breaking and having to start over. For newbs and intermediate users, what are some common things we should get in the habit of doing to maintain the overall health of our systems? things beyond the usual autoremove, autopurge, update, upgrade, blah blah. Even delving into security and networking to ensure max performance and safety. Or how to find errors/bugs/misconfigured files/ or even files that need to be configured. I just want to make sure my system is running smoothly, safely, and correctly at all times. I recently did a systemd-analyze security check and the results freaked me out lol but that whole side of Linux is a bit confusing for me lol any tips would be appreciated

 I'm running Mint Jammy btw

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[12月1日消息，腾讯游戏管家今天表示，因业务运营策略调整，2022年12月31日起腾讯游戏管家PC端将停止服务。


据悉，腾讯游戏管家由腾讯网游加速器升级而来，是一款免费游戏加速管理工具，包括支持《王者荣耀》、《绝地求生》等热门游戏，可以提高游戏的稳定性和安全性。


另外，由于平台运营策略调整，结合整体运营情况考虑，迅雷网游加速器宣布于2022年12月1日停运，关停加速服务和各类活动。


据介绍，腾讯网游加速器是腾讯出品的游戏加速器软件，可以针对旗下网络游戏和国内外市面上火热的网络游戏进行加速，降低游戏延迟，减少卡顿。通常玩家玩外服游戏时，会选择使用加速器改善网络质量。


据了解，去年腾讯加速器曾经发布公告显示，因腾讯加速器产品策略调整，暂不接受新增充值。

We've built startups (Ryan was Dir. of Engineering at N26) and worked in big tech (William was SRE at Spotify), and in every company, saw the same pattern of data spreading out of control. It felt like a dirty secret: hundreds of employees are granted access to customer PII through internal systems. Engineers responsible for securing data end up in a race against a growing list of SaaS or internal tools in use across the organization, and fall back to using bad access management workflows. Trying to secure data by controlling access is a risky proposition on its own — data …]]></summary>

clearly been successful; unlike OpenOffice,

        <id>https://www.williamlong.info/archives/7008.html</id>
        <link href="https://www.williamlong.info/archives/7008.html"/>
        <updated>2022-12-01T14:02:35.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[在蒂姆·库克说苹果将从TMSC的亚利桑那州工厂采购芯片后，一份新的报告对它将开始使用什么工艺以及最初的生产量有了更多的了解。在最初说它将在亚利桑那州开始生产5纳米工艺的芯片后，该公司显然改变了主意。当第一家工厂在现在看来是2024年全面开工时，它将生产4纳米芯片。到那时，台积电的主要代工厂预计将达到3纳米。


而且，一份新报告称，该厂约三分之一的产能将用于苹果。据说该厂之前的产能约为2万块完整的晶圆，该报告还称，随着时间的推移，这个数字可能会增加。


该计划预计将于12月6日全面披露。包括苹果公司首席执行官蒂姆-库克、英伟达首席执行官黄仁勋和AMD首席执行官Lisa Su在内的科技界名人预计都会到场。据彭博社周四晚上的报道，总统乔-拜登，商务部长吉娜-雷蒙多据说也会出席。


“我们已经做出决定，要从亚利桑那州的一家工厂买断产能，亚利桑那州的这家工厂在2024年开工，所以我们在这个问题上大约有两年的时间，也许更少一点，”据报道，库克在10月份在欧洲的一次会议上说。“在欧洲，我确信，随着这些计划变得更加明显，如有必要我们也将从欧洲采购。”


台积电在亚利桑那州的芯片制造厂于2021年6月开始施工。该公司最初预计在2022年9月启动生产，但时间表被推后了约6个月--这一延迟将全部芯片制造推到了2024年。


据报道，亚利桑那州的劳动力储备也给台积电带来了挑战。英特尔已经雇用了12000名员工，并寻求为其扩建的设施再雇用3000名员工。台积电在为其新工厂寻找人才时，将不得不在这个失业率已经很低的地区竞争，干净的水的供应可能也是一个问题。


台积电似乎对在美国能够取得的成功水平持怀疑态度。而且，从台积电亚利桑那购买的芯片仍将不得不运往中国或印度生产iPhone，如果苹果要保持目前生产iPhone的地点不变。到2024年，转向美国本土的iPhone生产似乎不太可能。


7月份，台积电的股票在今年下跌了35%。到9月30日，它下跌了41%。11月3日，它达到了2022年的最低点，年内下跌了49%。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am running dual encrypted HDDs where one is for the OS and games, and the other is for trash like movies and stuff. And obviously, I still didn't write a bash script to auto-mount the luks partition because I'm too lazy to rtfm, and frankly I'm of the opinion that this should be an option somewhere ("remember password forever" does nothing because you are forced to use the keyring anyway).
 So as I was manually typing the decryption password every time I wanted to go to the second HDD, the computer kept pestering me about some keychain or whatever. On Chromium, it at least used to stop after you told it to frick off like 20 times, but this one never did (nor does it on Chromium anymore.. sigh..).
 Anyway, I never dove deep into it and it was absolutely logical to me that a keyring was something useful. And what would be useful but a fully functioning automounting with password pre-saved and encrypted. Frankly I thought that the keychain was the encryption key for the password, and that the computer uses it so it isn't stored in plaintext.
 So long story short, I still have to manually type the password, just not my decryption password, but the keychain password. How utterly useless. Replacing one password with another. What is the purpose of this? Who wants this? Why am I being pestered about this every singe time, and how the heck do I revert it or change the keyring password?
 In short, if linux is about freedom, then NO means NO whne I tell you to buzz off for the 54th time you ask me if I want a keychain. We need to stop this!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[在 Arch Linux 及其衍生版中安装 OpenOffice 的初学者指南。


OpenOffice 是最古老的自由开源的办公生产力套件，已经维护了一段时间。它是由 Apache 开发，尽管它已经被分叉为 LibreOffice，但仍然是一个受欢迎的套件。

本教程适用于那些想要安装 OpenOffice 以满足工作和其他需要的人。

注意：在安装之前，请记住许多更新的功能和与微软 Office 的兼容性在 OpenOffice 中并未得到完全支持。如果你想要更现代的 Office 套件版本，请尝试 LibreOffice。

在 Arch Linux 中安装 OpenOffice

OpenOffice 软件包 在 Arch 用户仓库中可用。因此，要安装它，你需要使用 AUR 助手程序。这是你需要做的。按照下面提到的步骤安装 Yay AUR 助手。如果你想了解有关 Yay 的更多信息，请参阅 此处提供 的详细指南。

依次运行以下命令来安装基本包并克隆 Yay：

sudo pacman -S base-develsudo pacman -S gitcd /optsudo git clone https://aur.archlinux.org/yay.git


通过将 debugpoint 替换为你的 Arch 系统的用户名来运行以下命令：

sudo chown -R debugpoint:users ./yay


最后，使用以下命令安装 AUR 助手：

cd yaymakepkg -si


完成后，使用以下命令安装 OpenOffice：

yay -S openoffice-bin




按照屏幕上的说明进行操作。安装后，你可以在应用菜单中找到它，如下图所示。

启动 OpenOffice 并将你的姓名和详细信息添加到启动向导中，你就可以使用了。





总结

使用上述方法，你还可以在 Majnaro 和其他基于 Arch Linux 的发行版中安装 OpenOffice。尽管它是一个较旧的办公生产力套件，但你应该记住，它并不完全兼容现代微软 Office 文档类型（例如 docx、xlsx）。

如果你在安装过程中遇到任何错误，请在下面的评论栏中给我们留言。

Mastodon 的安全性并不可靠

自从 Twitter 被收购后，Mastodon 引来了大量注意，用户数量激增，两周内总用户达到 870 万。有安全专家发现多个存在安全漏洞的 Mastodon 实例。Mastodon 项目缺乏专门的安全团队，甚至软件也没有自动更新或检查更新的功能。


消息来源：Ars Technica



老王点评：随着用户增多，安全问题就成了大问题，好在 Mastodon 本身并不收集太多用户数据。




Let's Encrypt 签发了逾三十亿证书

目前全球有数以百万计的网站依赖 Let's Encrypt 作为安全保障。其 2022 年年度报告中称，截至 2022 年 11 月 1 日，它为超过 3.09 亿个域名提供了证书，仅 2022 年增加了逾 3300 万个域名。Let's Encrypt 在 2017 年 6 月签发了第一亿个证书。三年后的 2020 年 2 月签发了第 10 亿个证书。

广州小雪过后的天气晴阴无定，冷暖交替。虽然蛰居乡野，暂离尘嚣，在这样时令中读书的心情仍然很受影响。原以为在这时没什么心情读那些大部头的书，但是前几天参加由新京报书评和广西师大社上海分部组织的线上读书谈，主题就是在今天为什么要读“厚重之书”，正好应对了时下的读书心情。何谓“厚重之书”? 在我看来很难下一个严格的定义，只能说它有一个大致的指向。大部头的篇幅固然是一个因素，但还有更重要的因素是内容、思想内涵、经典地位以及面向现实和未来的开放性意义。有些“导读”“讲义”类著作的篇幅并不“厚重”，但是同样可以以其学术与思想含量给人以厚重之感。例如英国学者西蒙·斯威夫特（Simon Swift）的《导读阿伦特》（陈高华译，重庆大学出版社，2018年）是“劳特利奇批判思想家”（Routledge Critical Thinkers）系列中的一本，这套丛书的“编者前言”说，该丛书致力于把那些重要思想家和他们的观念放回原本的语境中论述，从而引导读者阅读思想家的原著。或许在专业研究者看来，这类“导读”面向初学者和学生，往往不具有学术上的深度和作者的独创性思维。但是，有一次当我和尔克讨论这类“导读”书的时候，他却提出了一些反证，例如那套“牛津通识读本”中的《维特根斯坦与哲学》（by A. C. Grayling），不仅对概述性的导读持有高度谨慎的态度，同时对维特根斯坦在晚近哲学中的地位和影响也提出了不乏独创性和争议性的见解，这说明不可否认的是，有些“导读”的学术目标并不满足于概述与介绍；当然他也认为过于充满个人性和争议性的“导读”实际上或许难以符合这类丛书读物的初衷。这是一个颇有意思的关注视角，或许可以让我们重新思考何谓“厚重之书”。

一
北魏末年，政治衰乱，兵连祸结。北方六镇、关陇、河北、山东等地相继爆发起义，北魏王朝陷于分崩离析状态，旋即分裂为东魏和西魏。534年，渤海王高欢立孝静帝，定都邺城（今河北临漳县），史称东魏；550年，高欢之子高洋废东魏，建立北齐。535年，关西大行台宇文泰在长安拥立文帝，史称西魏；557年，宇文泰之子宇文觉废西魏，建立北周。建德六年（577年），北周武帝宇文邕灭北齐，统一了中国北部。
政权的对立却不能影响文化的同源与发展，北方东西对峙的两个政权，在佛教艺术的传承上保持了高度一致性，均沿袭北魏王朝平城和洛阳时代皇室权贵开窟造像的传统，石窟寺艺术继续蓬勃发展。
北魏都平城时期，在今大同以西武州山开凿窟龛百余，其中最早的五座石窟是文成帝命沙门统昙曜开凿的，是为“昙曜五窟”。及至献文、孝文诸帝，都在这里大量兴造。云冈石窟气势磅礴，最大的佛像高达十余米，真容巨壮，雕饰奇伟。孝文帝迁都洛阳后，石窟艺术更形发展，宣武帝在洛阳以南伊阙龙门山营造石窟，为父母孝文帝和文昭皇太后并自身各建一窟，凡为三所，工程浩大，斩山数十丈，二十余年中用人工八十万以上。至于高官显贵的造像也是盛极一时，龙门断壁上石龛遍布，石佛林立。云冈石窟与龙门石窟，成为中国古代雕刻艺术的两大宝库，正是在这样的时代背景下，东西对峙的两个政权各自开窟造像，石窟寺艺术蔚为大观。
东魏北齐时期，最重要的石窟寺是由高齐皇室、显贵及高僧经营开凿的响堂山石窟。其中北响堂石窟是规模最大的石窟寺，为高齐皇室所开，雕刻精美，气势恢弘，充分显示了皇家造像的非凡气度，是东魏北齐石窟造像的精粹所在。北响堂以北洞体量最大，开凿年代最早，洞窟面阔、进深、高均十余米。南响堂石窟由灵化寺僧慧义兴凿，丞相高阿那肱资助修成，并有北齐最高僧官之一沙门统定禅师参与石窟开凿。
西魏北周时期，虽没有发现皇室开窟造像的记载，…]]></summary>

 You just need to tell Flatpak apps where to look for it:
  
Set a couple overrides to expose the GTK and QT configurations in ~/.config.
 For GTK, find and install the GTK themes as Flatpaks from Flathub.
 For QT, install every org.kde.KStyle.Kvantum Flatpak package. (Different apps may use different runtimes, so just grab all the versions.)
 For QT, also copy the QT themes from /usr to ~/.config if they aren't already there.
  
This assumes that your system is already set up to use Kvantum in QT5CT/System Settings/Whatever— I recommend that anyway as it's worked pretty well for me.
 So after doing this, the global system state should be something like below:

        <id>https://linux.cn/article-15306-1.html?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss</id>
        <link href="https://linux.cn/article-15306-1.html?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss"/>
        <updated>2022-12-01T01:41:12.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[埃隆·马斯克证实，加密私信即将到来! 这是好东西。




今年早些时候，埃隆·马斯克 在 Twitter 上表示：Twitter 的 私信Direct Messages（DM）需要像 Signal 协议这样的 端到端加密End-to-End Encryption。

早在 2016 年，爱德华·斯诺登就 要求 Twitter 的前首席执行官兼联合创始人杰克·多尔西添加 Signal 协议类似的安全措施到 Twitter 平台。

但是，这个协议从来没有被添加到 Twitter。它可能经过测试但还未部署实施。

根据最近的公告，Twitter 似乎即将实现这个安全协议 😌。

马斯克分享了他在公司演讲中的几张幻灯片，其中就包括为 Twitter 2.0 路线图规划的“加密私信”。

🔒 Twitter 通信的 Signal 协议



虽然有一些安全研究员，例如 黄文津，已经在 Twitter 的 iOS 和 Android 应用程序中发现了对 Signal 协议 的代码引用。

但是直到现在，埃隆·马斯克才在 推文 中确认了该计划，该推文介绍了根据 “Twitter 2.0” 路线图将对 Twitter 平台进行的改进。

换句话说，埃隆·马斯克正式确认 Twitter 即将推出加密私信。



对于那些不知道 Signal 协议的人，我们简要地介绍一下 Signal 协议：Signal 协议是一种开源的加密协议，它允许以 完全前向保密perfect forward secrecy（PFS）方式实施端到端加密。

该协议使用 “双棘轮算法Double Ratchet algorithm”，通信双方根据不断变化的共享密钥，来交换加密的消息。

这确保没有第三方可以得到通信消息的内容，因为共享密钥仅存在于通信双方的设备上。

Signal 应用程序充分利用了这个方法。但是，进一步来说，还有几个以隐私为中心的替代方案：

（LCTT 译注：Signal 协议是一种真正的端到端加密的通讯协议，号称是世界上最安全的通讯协议。只有参与通讯的用户可以读取并解密信息，而任何第三方（包括服务器）都无法查看到通讯的内容。总的来说，它可以防止潜在的窃听者（包括：通信服务商、互联网服务提供商甚至是该通讯系统的提供者），获取能够用以解密通讯内容的密钥。目前有大量即时通讯软件也使用或借鉴参考了 Signal 协议，例如：Skype、What'sApp、Facebook Messenger）

Signal 协议如何帮助 Twitter DM？

它可以防止恶意攻击者和政府去窥探 Twitter 用户的消息，从而使 Twitter 成为一个更加安全的平台。

Twitter 添加加密私信会对举报人、记者和社会活动家有益，因为他们经常会因其工作而面临被审查或成为攻击目标。

诚然，就隐私而言，加密私信可能不是最严格的保护措施。但有总比没有好。

🔏 加密消息应该成为通讯软件的标准

在这个动荡的信息时代，我们看到更多的恶意攻击者试图未经授权访问敏感信息。

端到端加密应成为所有通讯软件的必要标准，我希望 Twitter 能够尽快添加它。

 I changed my user agent to chrome to see if that would work. And of course it went past the starting page. After I took the url of the document management page, switched my user agent back and went to that url. It took me back to the starting page 
 This means the code of google docs is set to deny service to anyone not using chromium by a perceived “glitch” and if the glitch was not intentional. It would be found and patched by the trillion dollar corporation of google. 
 I must conclude this is an intentional obstruction of utility to push a product made by google 
 Google images dose “function” but it’s UI changes to a half working, barely functional system 
 I am getting rid of Google products in my life soon. Their hostile tactics to make as much money as possible to detriment of utility unacceptable

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This doesn't mean that realtek is better or Intel is worse, I just think that what wifi card is that best is not as cut and dry as folks make it out to seem. On my current HP laptop and my previous Dell laptop, Intel wifi cards will drop out every 30 minutes to an hour or so. I have to go into airplane mode or log out to get it to work again. This realtek card, no matter how much folks dislike it, has been a solid workhorse for me.
 I know there's been a lot of talk this week about the state of linux wireless, and I just wanted to put out there that I don't think it is as easy as just putting an intel card in a linux machine.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[苹果公司对中国制造业的广泛敞口，因其成本低和风险上升而备受关注，公司供应链数据显示，自COVID-19大流行病开始以来，这种敞口已经消退了。随着富士康在中国中部经营的全球最大的iPhone工厂出现劳动力和产能问题，分析师预计苹果的产能转换工作将加速。


路透社对苹果公司供应链数据的分析显示，中国在该公司全球制造业中的突出地位正在下降。在截至2019年的五年里，中国是其44%至47%的供应商生产基地的主要地点，但2020年下降到41%，2021年下降到36%。


这些数据显示了苹果公司及其供应商的多元化驱动，在印度和越南的投资以及从台湾地区、美国和其他地方的采购增加，正在重塑全球供应结构，尽管分析师和学者们说，在未来许多年里，它仍将严重依赖中国。


康奈尔大学研究中国劳工的副教授Eli Friedman说：“中国的供应链不会在一夜之间消失。对这些公司来说，被取代暂时还不现实，”尽管他预计多样化会加速。


苹果的供应商集中在中国，富士康生产的iPhone占全球供货量的70%，这一直是世界上最赚钱的智能手机供应商苹果的一个关键特征。


知情的政府官员本月早些时候告诉路透社，富士康正在加紧在印度的扩张，计划在两年内将其iPhone工厂的员工人数增加四倍。


摩根大通预计，从今年年底开始，苹果将把约5%的iPhone 14生产转移到印度，到2025年，每四部iPhone中就有一部在印度生产，并估计到2025年，约25%的苹果产品，包括Mac电脑、iPad、Apple Watch和AirPods，将在中国以外的地方生产，而现在只有5%。


然而，根据路透社的分析，到2021年的苹果供应商数据显示，到目前为止，没有任何地方能成为与中国的下降相匹配的大幅增长一方。


美国从2019年的7.2%上升到2021年的10.7%，其次是台湾地区，从6.7%上升到9.5%。印度仍然是一个相对较小的存在，从不到1%上升到1.5%，而越南从2.2%扩大到3.7%。


“越南和印度不是中国。”康奈尔大学的弗里德曼说：“他们无法以这种规模、质量和周转时间以及基础设施的可靠性进行生产。”


苹果公司的年度供应链数据涵盖其顶级供应商中的600多个地点，这些供应商占苹果公司直接支出的98%。苹果公司没有披露它与每个供应商的花费，而且名单上的供应商每年都会发生变化，因为不同的公司在苹果公司的数千家供应商中脱颖而出。它们包括组装iPhone、iPad、手表和无线耳机的合同制造商，以及芯片、玻璃、铝壳、电缆、电路板和其他部件的供应商。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It was only a matter of time before somebody found a way to inject BPF into
the CPU scheduler.  This patch
series, posted by Tejun Heo and containing work by David Vernet, Josh
Don, and Barret Rhoden, does exactly that.  The cover letter covers the
motivation behind this work in detail:


	One of our main goals was to lower the barrier to entry for
	experimenting with the scheduler. sched_ext provides ergonomic
	callbacks and helpers to ease common operations such as managing
	idle CPUs, scheduling tasks on arbitrary CPUs, handling preemptions
	from other scheduling classes, and more. While sched_ext does
	require some ramp-up, the complexity is self-contained, and the
	learning curve gradual. Developers can ramp up by first
	implementing simple policies such as global FIFO in only tens of
	lines of code, and then continue to learn the APIs and building
	blocks available with sched_ext as they build more featureful and
	complex schedulers.


There is a bit more documentation in this
patch.]]></summary>

英伟达最近发布的一篇论文，披露了其为《我的世界》游戏训练的通用 AI 代理 MineDojo。研究人员给它输入了 73 万个 YouTube 视频（转录了超过 22 亿字），抓取了 7000 个维基网页，以及 34 万个 Reddit 帖子和 660 万条评论。人们可以用高级自然语言告诉 MineDojo 代理在游戏中做什么。不同于其它为电子游戏开发的 AI，它们往往只擅长特定的任务，研究人员开发了一个可扩展的训练框架，能够成功执行各种开放式任务的通用代理。

老王点评：能根据自然语言进行游戏，这距离通用 AI 更进一步了。




GPT-3 可以写押韵的诗歌和歌词

OpenAI 宣布了 GPT-3 的一个新模型，人们发现它可以生成押韵的歌曲、打油诗和诗歌，而这是 GPT-3 以前无法产生的水平。用机器生成诗歌并不新鲜，甚至早在 1845 年，发明家们就已经在想办法通过自动化来写出有表现力的诗句。但是，专家们特别指出，GPT-3 的最新模型可以将有关各种主题和风格的知识整合到一个能写出连贯文字的模型中。

老王点评：AI 甚至可以写押韵的诗歌，比那些下三路诗歌强了不止一点。




API 安全漏洞成为大量泄露数据的重要风险

恶意行为者利用 2021 年 12 月披露的一个 API 漏洞，获得了超过 540 万 Twitter 用户的数据。报告称，在过去 12 个月里，95% 的企业在生产用的 API 中遇到了安全问题，20% 的企业由于 API 中的安全漏洞而遭受数据泄露。API 攻击的一个不幸的现实是，这些系统的漏洞提供了对前所未有的数据量的访问。

老王点评：API 是一道通向内部的门，而设计一个完善安全的 API 的重要性，往往被人忽视。]]></summary>

 Suppose I have a simple program in any language, e.g. python in this case:

 And we run it from a terminal with an input stream, e.g. "python3 programName <text.txt", where "text.txt" is a file with one line that says "John" say, then we see this output in the terminal:
 What is your name?Hello, John. 
 But if we run the program manually, and type in "John", then we see something different:
 What is your name? John Hello, John 
 Is there clever trick we can use to make it so that the first method produces output similar to the second method? We want "python3 programName <text.txt" to produce:
 What is your name? John Hello, John. 
 using some clever modification to the command line we issue. In summary, we want to see the word "John" appear twice (without modifying the python program content)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Midori 网页浏览器还是活跃的，即将到来的更新整合了一个开源搜索引擎！




几年前，Midori 是一个相当受欢迎的轻量级开源网页浏览器。

有些人认为它已经终止了，不知道它是否还在活动。

好消息是：

作为一个 自由开源的 产品，Midori 网页浏览器是活跃的（在测试阶段）、可用的 。

它是一个基于 Chromium 的以 Electron 构建的浏览器，但没有谷歌的东西和隐私保护功能。


💡 2019 年，该项目被终止，并与 Astian 合并为一个移动浏览器，当时我们并没有立即得到消息该浏览器是否将卷土重来或保持开源。


此外，在即将到来的浏览器更新中，他们计划将自己的开源搜索引擎 AstianGO 与之整合。🤯

这与 Brave（及其搜索引擎）有些类似，但 Brave Search 不是开源的。

AstianGO：开源搜索引擎

在一个 Reddit 帖子 中，来自 Astian 的某个人宣布计划在 Midori 网页浏览器中集成一个开源搜索引擎，即 AstianGO，并在下次更新时加入。

源代码还没有发布，应该可以通过 这个 GitLab 页面 获得。



透露的细节不多，但以下是他们提到的内容：


我们已经实现并开发了一个完全开源的搜索引擎，没有使用第三方的 API，它不存储用户的 IP 地址，不存储搜索历史。我们把这个搜索引擎称为 AstianGO，这个搜索引擎是用 PHP 开发的，它是自我托管的，尽管它还没有一个集成的更新系统，人们可以把它部署在他们的服务器上。


该搜索引擎使用来自谷歌、Qwant 和 Brave Search 的数据来提供结果。你可以看看它的 FAQ 来了解它的工作原理。

其他的浏览器，有些集成了以隐私为重点的搜索引擎，有些承诺提供隐私保护功能。



当然，这个搜索引擎看起来是一个正在进行的工作。

但是，一个开源的网页浏览器，带有隐私保护的搜索引擎（也是开源的），可能对大多数用户来说是带有太多不确定性。



Midori 的目标是通过这一补充来改变这一状况。

Midori 网页浏览器的状态

这听起来不错，但我认为这并没有充分的计划。

有一个 AppImage 和一个 .deb包 可用。它也可用于其他平台。

我试着从它的 下载页面 安装 Midori 浏览器（.deb 包），但我无法在 Ubuntu 22.04 LTS 上安装它 🚫

AppImage 文件可以使用 ✅

下载页面没有反映出所有的信息来告知 Linux 发行版的支持情况；它只是提到了 Debian x64，并没有完全翻译成英文。



所以，我不确定我们是否可以推荐使用该浏览器。

当然，考虑到它还在测试阶段，你不应该依赖它。你可以浏览它的 GitLab 页面 来了解更多。

思考？

我认为一个新的开源搜索引擎是一件好事。我仍然不确定 Linux 的 Midori 网页浏览器是否可以推荐，我需要通过测试才能在将来推荐它。

_是这个开源搜索引擎更让你兴奋，还是浏览器？请在下面的评论中告诉我你的想法。

如果你了解美国城市史，你一定知道斯蒂芬·塞恩斯托姆（Stephan Thernstrom）；如果你想了解美国城市史，你一定要知道斯蒂芬·塞恩斯托姆。在史学界，那些能够对社会已经达成共识的重大历史问题做出新解释的学者并不多见，那些能够开创新研究范式的学者也算得上是圈中顶流，而塞恩斯托姆几乎都做到了。在《其他波士顿人：美国大都市的贫穷与进步，1880-1970》（The Other Bostonians: Poverty and Progress in the American Metropolis, 1880-1970, Cambridge, Mass: Harvard University Press, 1973）中，他将目光投向美国的社会流动性（social mobility），试图用最可靠的数据告诉我们，这种流动性究竟有多高。
美国人对白手起家的传奇总是津津乐道，钢铁大亨安德鲁·卡内基、脱口秀主持人奥普拉·温弗瑞、“星巴克之父”霍华德·舒尔茨以及首位非裔美国人总统巴拉克·奥巴马，都是美国穷小子变成精英的典型。他们的经历，在不同的年代里提醒着一代代美国人，霍雷肖·阿尔杰（Horatio Alger Jr.，1834-1899，美国儿童文学作家，作品大多描写穷孩子如何通过勤奋和诚实获得成功）的故事永不过时。事实似乎真的就像劳伦斯·塞缪尔说的那样，在美国，“任何怀有果敢精神的人通过辛勤劳动都可以登上胜利的顶峰”。美国社会乐于标榜自己的社会流动性更高，以此来说明美国是一片人人都能找到机遇的乐土。可是，这样的看法到底是真是假？

Cinnamon 桌面环境 是 Linux Mint 的默认桌面风格。创建这个基于 GTK 的桌面环境是为了提供具有以前的 GNOME 的传统桌面风格（即 GNOME 3 之前的外观）。该桌面本身很轻巧，非常人性化。因为它保留了经过时间考验的图标和菜单驱动的桌面行为，因此它被认为（与 Linux Mint 结合）是新 Linux 用户易于使用的桌面之一。

尽管 Cinnamon 及其软件包与 Linux Mint 紧密结合，但该桌面可以作为单独的桌面环境安装在 Ubuntu、Fedora 或 Arch Linux 中。

在 Arch Linux 中安装 Cinnamon 相当容易，就像在 Arch 中安装其他桌面（例如 Xfce 和 KDE Plasma）一样。但它需要安装一些特定的软件包才能使其看起来像一个合适的 Cinnamon 桌面。

让我们开始吧。

在 Arch Linux 中安装 Cinnamon 桌面

第 1 步：安装基本系统

本指南假设你已经安装了基本的 Arch 系统。如果你没有安装基本系统，请按照 自动化 Arch 安装指南（推荐方法）进行安装。然后按照以下步骤操作。

第 2 步：更新你的系统

在你的 Arch 中打开一个终端。并通过运行以下命令确保系统是最新的：

pacman -Syu


第 3 步：安装 yay AUR 助手

配置 Cinnamon 所需的某些包在 Arch 官方仓库中不可用。它们在 Arch 用户仓库（AUR）中。因此，你需要安装 yay 以获得额外的软件包。按照 本指南安装 yay AUR 助手。

如果在古代文学领域评选存在感最低的断代文学，北朝文学或许能够摘得“桂冠”。这个阶段看起来缺少名作和名家，其中最著名的庾信还是位南方“移民”。然而北朝绝不是一个沉寂的时代，华夷、士庶、文武诸多元素杂糅在这段历史中，文化、政治等诸多变革也发生在北方的大地。其文学上的尴尬地位，很大程度上来自于简单的标签化定义。质朴贞刚、南北融合是北朝文学的标志特点和脉络，二者共同搭建起了北朝文学史的基础框架。这些关于北朝文学的经典论断皆来源于《魏书》《周书》《北齐书》《隋书》以及《北史》五部正史。以上史书除了《魏书》，其余诸部皆编写于唐代，可以说，今天的我们正是透过唐代史官的“眼睛”来了解北朝文学的，而唐人南北争胜的立场，影响着我们看待这段风云诡谲历史的视野与焦点。因此，深入理解正史叙事塑造的北朝文学之框架，探索其中的内涵和外延，是开拓北朝文学时代视野重要路径。
一、文与质：南北争胜的叙事与视野
魏徵《隋书·文学传序》提出南北文风差异说，在两者的对比中首次确立了北朝文学“质”的特点。
暨永明、天监之际，太和、天保之间，洛阳、江左，文雅尤盛……彼此好尚，互有异同。江左宫商发越，贵于清绮；河朔词义贞刚，重乎气质。气质则理胜其词，清绮则文过其意。理深者便于时用，文华者宜于咏歌。
此论断影响深远，现代研究多遵循其说作为北朝文学的立论基础。但统揽诸史的论述，这个奉为圭臬的经典观点仍值得思考。《隋书》选取北魏洛阳以及北齐邺城的文学冠以“贞刚气质”的特性。“质”作为与“文”相对的文学属性，具有的内涵是：内容重于形式，实用大于抒情。在魏徵的定义中，洛阳、邺城文学具有自身独特的审美属性，与南朝吟咏性情、文辞绮丽的文风明确划清了界限。然而其他诸史中却对其持以完全相反的定义。如《周书·苏绰传》则认为“逮乎江左，弥复轻薄。洛阳后进，祖述不已”，洛阳文学崇尚学习南朝绮靡风气…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[你是否在寻找一份在 Debian 11（Bullseye）上安装 Kubernetes 集群的简易指南？


这份分步指南将向你展示如何使用 Kubeadm 工具在 Debian 11 上安装 Kubernetes 集群。

Kubernetes（k8s）集群包含主控节点和工作节点，用于运行容器化的应用程序。主控节点作为控制平面，工作节点为实际工作负载提供环境。

前置条件：


已安装 Debian 11

2 CPU / vCPU

2 GB RAM

20 GB 空闲硬盘空间

有管理员权限的 sudo 用户

稳定的网络连接


实验环境配置：

在本文中，我使用了 3 个 Debian 11 系统的节点，配置如下


主控节点（k8s-master） – 192.168.1.236

工作节点 1（k8s-worker1） – 192.168.1.237

工作节点 2（k8s-worker2） – 192.168.1.238


事不宜迟，我们直接进入安装步骤。

1、设置主机名和更新 /etc/hosts 文件

在主控节点和工作节点上使用 hostnamectl 命令来设置主机名：

$ sudo hostnamectl set-hostname "k8s-master"       // 在主控节点运行
$ sudo hostnamectl set-hostname "k8s-worker1"      // 在工作节点 1 运行
$ sudo hostnamectl set-hostname "k8s-worker2"      // 在工作节点 2 运行


在所有节点的 /etc/hosts 文件末尾添加下面几行内容：

192.168.1.236       k8s-master
192.1…]]></summary>

 Okular, qpdfview, Evince, Atril, xpdf are affected. But internet browsers (except Falkon!), and other PDF viewers (WPS PDF, LibreOffice Draw, ImageMagick, mupdf, gv, PDF Studio Viewer, Foxit, Master PDF) are not affected.
 Such PDF pages/files have some obscure variations or defaults that cannot be handled by poppler. They can be fixed by printing them "as pdf" in Firefox or other browsers (in Chrome, Vivaldi, Opera you have to select "print to image" too) or in PDF viewers that can see in the first place the otherwise blank pages and are able to print to file/pdf: 
 * PDF Studio Viewer has the option "print to file"
 * Master PDF Editor has the option "System print", and under there it's the needed option

authority to run its servers; anyone can run their own.  Servers communicate
with each other, allowing people on different servers to send each other

I have an idea for a specification that apps could use to describe a layout of widgets (butons, sliders, checkboxes, menus, etc) to the window manager/compositor, which could then draw it on the titlebar of the app. This combines the benifits of both CSD and no-CSD, but most importantly it makes everyone happy.
 Originally, I went to the XDG mailing list and asked them if it could become a spec, and gave some examples of how it could benifit a couple of desktop environments I mentioned. Basially all the told me is that "GNOME probably won't add support for that" and "GTK headerbars won't work with that design".

 So every couple of weeks or so, I kept trying Wayland to see how it's working, and I never dreamt of being able to use Wayland for at least another year. This is because I have always had severe graphical problems, visual glitches and intense lags.
 However, about 48 hours ago I decided to switch to Wayland once again and try it, and what do you know, I've actually had almost 0 problems (And the ones I had were so rare and minor).
 So for once, I am actually using Wayland and loving it. Might be worth trying Wayland again if you have been in my shoes. (Haven't had much luck with KDE Wayland still)
 Thank you, everyone who has worked to have it working like it is now.

在Fragment强劲销售的支持下，Durov正在为Telegram设定一个更深入的加密货币建设的路线。他说，该公司将建立一个去中心化的交易所和非托管的钱包，可以覆盖数百万用户。Telegram已经是许多加密货币交易商的首选消息应用程序。


该声明是首次确认Telegram直接参与将TON区块链整合到信使应用中。早些时候，杜罗夫谈到区块链开发是一个社区项目，Telegram只是乐于观望。


该系统早先被称为Newton和Toncoin，是由Telegram开发的最初TON概念发展而来的两个竞争对手项目之一。这两个项目都是由社区的支持者开发的，尽管最后只有一个得到了Telegram的官方认可。


杜罗夫在其个人频道的一条信息中，将Telegram的努力与失败的加密货币交易所FTX的“过度集中化”进行了对比。


他说：“加密货币用户应该转向无信任交易和自我托管的钱包，不依赖任何单一的第三方。”


周三早些时候，TON网络的支持者宣布了一个1.26亿美元的“救援基金”，以支持被FTX倒闭所困扰的加密货币项目。截至记者发稿时，TON币的交易价格上涨了近4%。

印度使用 AI 来对抗垃圾短信

印度电信管理局之前采用区块链技术来消除垃圾短信，但效果不尽如人意。这个由区块链驱动的应用程序记录了超过 25 万个进行电话营销活动的主要实体的细节，使印度境内的客户对垃圾短信的投诉减少了 60%，但仍有大量投诉。印度电信管理局准备实施新的检测系统，利用人工智能和机器语言对标题和信息模板进行智能清洗等等。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[随着 helloSystem 0.7.0 的发布和更多内部工作，helloSystem 正在增强稳定性，为 macOS 提供一个“开源”的替代方案。


helloSystem 是一个基于 FreeBSD 的轻量级操作系统，旨在为 macOS 提供一个“开源”的替代方案。helloSystem 的主要目标是提供一个易于安装和使用的，真正“开源”的 FreeBSD 替代方案。此外，该团队还专注于从 macOS 转换过来的用户，他们可以舒适的使用类似的桌面，而不会受到系统锁定或 Linux 发行版的复杂性的影响。

考虑到 BSD 系统中的硬件支持，开发这样的操作系统需要时间。团队正在努力从零创建一个桌面 - “hellodesktop”。用 C++ 编写的 hellodesktop 和其他改进正在进行中。



helloSystem 0.7.0

在 2021 年底，该团队发布了最新一个稳定版本，基于 FreeBSD 13.0 的 helloSystem 0.7.0，并且目前正在将系统移植到 FreeBSD 13.1 和 14 版本。

除此之外，一些新功能也可以在系统中工作了；这是一个总览：


由 FreeBSD 13.0 驱动

通过更新的启动时间和压缩的 UFS 文件系统改进的现场介质Live Media

将 ISO 镜像大小减少到 800 MB，以适合 CD

与 Ventoy USB creator 兼容

支持英伟达 GPU，包括旧型号

在目标分区安装时添加了 exFAT 支持

增加了 KDE 开发的 Falkon 浏览器，附带了下载和安装 Chromium 和 Firefox 的附加菜单项

系统提示音

支持通过笔记本电脑键盘的专用键控制亮度和音量




除了上述内容之外，helloSystem 0.7.0 中还添加了一个新部分，以让你可以提前了解团队正在开发的功能。未来版本中将到来的一些最酷的功能包括：


BSD 中的 Debian 运行时安装程序，以在 BSD 中运行 Linux 应用程序！

一个独立的应用程序，用于下载应用程序。

新的更新实用程序


此外，0.7.0 中还修复了一些错误并更新了翻译。



话虽如此，但它仍然需要大量的时间才能成为易于使用的 BSD 变体和 macOS 的“开源”替代方案。自从我 首次报道 以来，已经在图形安装程序，桌面应用程序和错误修复方面进行了巨大的更新。我希望它在随着 2023 年移植到 FreeBSD 14 之后，会变得更加主流。

下载

如果你想在真实的硬件上尝试它，请先进行备份然后尝试。此外，helloSystem 现在完全兼容 VirtualBox 之类的虚拟机。你可以试试。如果你在 VirtualBox 中尝试，请确保将 CPU 更改为 64 位。

官方下载链接（包括 helloSystem 0.7.0 稳定版）可在 此页面 上找到，或者您可以使用下面的链接获取 ISO。


下载 helloSystem 0.7.0


如果你想为测试、开发或任何其他事情做出贡献，请 访问 GitHub 页面以获取详细信息。

那第三方或者外部存储库呢？不，我这里并不是要讲 PPA。

早晚你会碰到那种至少四行的安装说明：你需要安装名为 apt-transport-https 的包、操作一下 GPG 和 源列表source list 之后，你才能正常安装软件包。

没有什么印象的话，那我分享一个 在 Ubuntu 上安装最新版本的 Yarn 的例子：

sudo apt install apt-transport-https curl
curl -sS https://dl.yarnpkg.com/debian/pubkey.gpg | sudo apt-key add -
sudo sh -c 'echo "deb https://dl.yarnpkg.com/debian/ stable main" >> /etc/apt/sources.list.d/yarn.list'
sudo apt update && sudo apt install yarn


当你需要直接从开发者那里安装编程工具的时候，大概率会碰到这种安装方式。

许多人只是按照说明进行操作，并不会去思考其中的原理。这也没什么不对，但了解该过程实际上可以提升你在这方面的知识，而且有助于之后排除故障。

我来解释一下这些代码背后的逻辑。

在你继续往下阅读之前，我强烈建议你先看看下面这两篇文章，方便理解后续的概念：

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[《周书》修订本，中华书局，2022年11月版

二十世纪四十年代陈寅恪先生提出“关陇集团”理论后，包括西魏北周史在内的中古史研究，基本沿“关陇集团”理论展开，形成了深厚学术积累。简而言之，“关陇集团”理论，即指北魏末西入关中的武川镇豪帅宇文泰，在占领关中后，将所占地区内胡汉族群、土著，通过以府兵制为主的“关中物质本位政策”和“周礼官制”为主的“关中文化本位政策”，融合成为拥有共同利益、与东魏北齐、萧梁对抗，建立北周隋唐，延续至唐高宗前期的政治集团。笔者拟就“关陇集团”理论来源、应用到西魏北周史研究中所遇到的问题，谈一下自己的思考。
一、“关陇集团”理论是对宋明史家研究成果的继承和发挥
脱胎于西魏北周的隋唐统一中国，创中古盛世，因此，传统史家十分重视西魏北周史研究，陈寅恪曾感慨“宋贤史学，今古罕匹”（陈寅恪：《隋唐制度渊源略论稿》，《陈寅恪集》，北京生活·读书·新知三联出版社2009年版，148页，以下简称《略论稿》）。陈寅恪“关陇集团”理论的形成，与宋明传统史家研究关系密切。宋人叶适指出宇文泰如王莽，行周官真正目的是要篡西魏，“王莽篡而作大诰，泰用周礼亦然，岂从周之伪者固当尔耶？”（《习学记言序目》，中华书局1977年版，521页，以下简称《记言》）正因如此，宇文泰在用周官设置官职时，仍杂用北魏及秦汉以后官职名称，遵循北魏末权臣尔朱荣以柱国掌握朝政的先例，自称柱国。这使其所行周官显得不伦不类，“而绰方与之法象周公，龟兹王褚煟所讥（非驴非马），依然故在，是真可笑矣！”（《记言》，524页）宋人胡寅《读史管见》卷十四《敬帝·太平元年条》也持此种看法，“今宇文氏之制，何所考哉？至于《周官》之属，有不当设而设者，有不当属而属者，其舛驳甚众”。明人王夫之也指出，宇文泰行周官只是借用周官名目，实现其篡权企图，徒有其表，“泰自以为周公，逆者丧心肆志之恒也”，“高洋之篡也，梁、陈之偷也，宇…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[在之前的文章《iPhone手机安全指南》，介绍了iPhone手机系统上使用的一些安全建议，下面将介绍一些iPhone手机APP的安全建议。


1. 软件安装渠道选择正规渠道来安装


iPhone的应用全部都使用应用商店来安装，不要越狱，不要使用一些第三方工具来安装软件。一般非iPhone手机会提供下载安装APP，这非常不安全，建议使用非iPhone手机的，建议换用iPhone。iOS的应用商店选择美国等其他国家的应用商店，iCloud也一样。安装的APP请求权限时，给最小的权限。一些敏感权限，例如位置、通讯录、摄像头等，只给哪些必要的APP授权使用。


2. 如有可能使用两个手机，将日常使用的APP和敏感工作用的APP隔离成两个手机，互不影响，这样即使一个手机遗失或失去控制，可以用另一个手机使用“查找”APP远程抹除遗失手机上的内容。


3. 手机号码的安全很重要，SIM卡一定要设置密码，遗失手机后第一时间挂失SIM卡。对于敏感APP，建议国内用户不要使用国内手机号码注册敏感APP，要用其他国家的手机号码注册，手机上不建议安装敏感APP，建议通过浏览器的无痕浏览模式登录WEB版网站。


4. 手机上不要安装和使用邮箱APP，也不要在iPhone手机上使用内置的电子邮件功能。否则，一旦手机被第三方获取，通过电子邮箱很可能会给用户带来巨大损失，例如通过邮箱重置各个关键网站或APP的密码，从而获得登录和使用权限，进行各种操作，控制用户的各种关键应用APP等等，使得用户的财产和人身安全遇到重大挑战。]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Kernel maintains a set of kernel threads for the sake of internal background jobs like processing interrupts or writing buffered data to disk (?).. and these threads have more or less the same priority(sometimes higher) than user mode threads, and are scheduled on the CPU the same way.
 When a user-mode thread needs to execute a system call, does the user-mode process **switch** to kernel mode and then execute the system call, and then **switch back** to user mode? Or does it delegate this sensitive instruction to a already alive (sleeping) kernel thread via IPC?
 It is said that the switch(if at all it does happen) is expensive. I believe IPC is equally expensive(?)
 EDIT:
 Seems that a userland process has two stacks, one for user mode, one for kernel mode. Hints that the process actually switches modes. But if creating kernel threads are far cheaper, why not bypass the expensive switch and just execute system calls in a newly spawned kernel thread?

据 2022 年 Stack Overflow 开发者调查，只有 9% 的开发者在使用 Rust，但它已经在“最受喜爱”的语言中占据了七年的位置。在今年的调查中，几乎有 87% 的开发者表示他们喜欢 Rust，这比第二大受欢迎的语言 Elixir 高出约 10 个百分点。

老王点评：看起来发展很好，而且已经进入了 Linux 内核，但是离撼动 C 和 C++ 的位置还需要很长的时间。




Docker Hub 至少有 1600 个公开镜像带有恶意行为

Docker Hub 是一个基于云的容器库，允许人们自由搜索和下载 Docker 镜像。除了由 Docker 库项目审查的镜像之外，在该服务上还有数十万个状态不明的镜像。Sysdig 使用其自动扫描器仔细检查了 25 万个未经验证的镜像，并确定其中 1652 个镜像是恶意的。这些恶意行为包括加密矿工、隐藏的认证凭证等。

新加坡将每棵大树都连上物联网

新加坡大约有 700 万棵树，他们通过一个巨大的物联网监测计划对 600 万棵大树进行监控。新加坡国家公园管理局用一个应用程序来管理它们，除了用 LiDAR 采集数据，对每棵植物进行地理定位之外，还通过卫星遥感进行多光谱分析，以确定叶绿素水平，确保树木仍然茁壮成长，以及在树木上安装倾斜传感器确保树木没有被移动或倾倒。

Looking into this, I can't seem to find a clear cut answer as to how the image can exist and be distributed, if it does fall under GPL.
 Some facts I came across:
  
Nvidia is using some compatibility layer trick to sidestep GPL - is this the reason why this is possible?
 Nvidia released (partial?) open-source drivers in 2022 - though I remember the Nvidia-specific image to be on offer even before 2022.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[《周书》修订本，中华书局，2022年11月版

《周书》是记述北魏东西分裂之后西魏和北周政权的纪传体断代史，中华书局点校本由前辈史学大师唐长孺先生负责整理，是“二十四史”中除前四史外出版的第一种。从计划伊始，到1965年完成点校，制版付型，再到最终出书，绵历十余年，其间种种因由，通过留存下来的书稿档案，才得见鳞爪。
1958年，在国务院领导下的古籍整理出版规划小组成立以后，中华书局随即正式启动整理二十四史计划。在同年10月拟订的计划中，整理二十四史被分为标点集注本和普通本两种系列，分别供专门研究者和一般读者需用。在集注本中，鉴于清初李清所撰《南北史合注》芜杂疏陋，而后出考订以及石刻文字等资料大多为其所未见，南北各史的纷乱脱误又较其他各史更甚，故而有新编《南北史补注》的设想。不过二十四史的集注本始终未能落地实施。在同年最早的一份《标点二十四史（普通本）约稿计划》中【图一】，便已经确定南北朝各史分别由山东大学和武汉大学承担，其中北朝四史（《魏书》《周书》《北齐书》《北史》）和《隋书》五种史书的标点整理者都是“拟约武汉大学”（《隋书》后来因武大、山大都未接受，另做了安排），预计完成时间则都是1959年11月。

图一：标点二十四史（普通本）约稿计划

这一时期的点校整理分头在各高校展开，实际开展工作已经晚于计划的完成时间。1960年底，武大历史系内成立了校点小组，由唐长孺任组长，姚薇元为副组长，组员中还包括陈仲安、石泉、赵婷、陈庆中、曹绍廉、谭两宜，正式开始点校工作。初步的整理计划是“先搞《周书》……其余三史，俟《周书》完成继续搞下去”，这也就使得《周书》成为“北朝四史”中最早整理的一种，而规模较大的《魏书》《北史》在此阶段一直没有着手。由于校点组也是第一次进行校史工作，标点和校勘的体例还处于摸索之中，加之时间和任务紧迫，初期也遇到一些困难。在1961年1月赵守俨所拟回复武大历史…]]></summary>

《错乱》这部小说属于拉丁美洲文学中现在很流行的一种特定的文学亚类型，即见证文学。往往是来自独裁、集权、第三世界国家或前社会主义阵营的自由主义知识分子，在后极端的政治情境之中对于普通人生活的描写。在政治腐败、军队独裁等高压制度面前，良知者发展出了一种强调政治作用、强调对普通人生活的记录和记忆的文学类型，尤其伴随着卡罗琳·佛雪、米沃什、索尔仁尼琴等作品在英语世界的畅销，开始蔚然成风。而在西语拉丁美洲文学中，如果以米盖尔·安赫尔·阿斯图里亚斯为起点的话，这些是几乎同步展开的。
但奥拉西奥·卡斯特利亚诺斯·莫亚的这部长篇小说的一个特殊之处，也是正在日渐转型中的当代很多优秀的长篇小说可以看到的一种特殊之处，在于抛弃了客观的、“逼真”的现实主义，而采取了一种主观视角。这和十九世纪中叶至二十世纪中叶的文学主流拉开了距离。我们不能说莫亚就直接地受到意识流小说的影响，尽管他毫无疑问是受到了乔伊斯、伍尔夫、普鲁斯特等现代主义作家群的启示，并且发展了内在聚焦的可能性，把书斋式的梦呓、内心独白与拉丁美洲极端的政治环境和平民生活联系在一起，形成了一种极为“真实”的虚妄语言，而这是远远超出了意识流作家们的蓝图的，倒有点像是伊斯梅尔·卡达莱或乔治·奥威尔与前者“合体”的版本。中国读者一定会在其中发现类似于《狂人日记》的疯狂举动，就像小说的标题本身叫“错乱”，他也是一个黑白颠倒的时代的“狂人”，作为叙事人的“我”是一个参与“历史记忆恢复计划”的编辑（这是一个跟危地马拉天主教会的历史相关的现实指涉），不过，《错乱》叙事者的狂不再是詹姆逊意义上的“民族寓言”，而是一个堕入犬儒主义的镜城的个体。这部小说当然是一个象征性的文本，讲一个人如何在诊断别人的paranoia（精神妄想症）…]]></summary>

2022年9月2日，张文艺葬礼在纽约中国城五福殡仪馆举行，我无法赶回。葬礼上，我们全家由母亲江巫惠淑率江青、江秀、江山、江川献上花圈，悼念这位挚友。想来眼前我唯一可以做的，是以此文聊作对老友的缅念与哀思。
1970年8月下旬，我背井离乡飞往了一个完全陌生的天地——美国洛杉矶，刚结束了痛苦的婚姻，感到自己唯一的出路是斩断一切过往，往前看、往远飞，越远越好。
以前素未谋面的张文艺、周鸿玲夫妇受电影导演陈耀祈之托，热心相助，接机后把我送至友人单氏姐妹家，没多久他们夫妇在圣莫尼卡（Santa Monica）替我觅得一简陋住处，是汽车间房顶加盖上去的一个阳光永远射不进的房间。我从A、B、C开始学英文，其他一切由零开始。他们帮我报名上英文课，申请装电话、接煤气水电、办银行开户手续、学习开车。至今记得文艺教我开车时嚷嚷：“教你开车，怎么你性子比我还急？！”为了设法把家里资助的钱用到最长的时间，我不舍得添置电视机解闷，为了省车费也不舍得出门。
灯下赶不走自己的身影，关了灯我又怕黑，一生中我没有一个人住一整间屋子的经验，尤其是那段时间晚上经常做噩梦，只能彻夜开灯，半夜里要是在灯下醒来，“影子”就更大也更阴森了。越坐越觉得浑身上下发冷发麻，于是就跑到离我住处有十条街的张家“避寒”。记得有几次午夜惊魂（做噩梦），也在半夜打电话求救。自觉打扰他们已经到了不可饶恕的地步，但他们总是伸出温暖的援手。虽然是自己选择到没有人认识我的环境，一切重新开始，但仅仅在一瞬间，我从云端滑入谷底……那年我二十四岁，感念当年他们夫妇雪中送炭并开导我认清残酷无情的现实。记得在美国过的第一个春节，我和他们全家吃了年夜饭后去圣莫尼卡海边散步，星空、巨浪、海风，忽…]]></summary>

古者立政安民，必求物尽其用，货畅其流。理财之义，既远且宏。传世先秦文献已多载及贡助之征、关市之税、山泽之赋等事项，又论量入为出、藏富于民诸原理。《尚书·洪范》所言“八政”，首论“食”（劝农业）与“货”（宝用物）；《史记》置《平准书》，专作《货殖列传》；《汉书》设《食货志》，皆关理财之事，而为专门篇章，历代正史多有借鉴。至杜佑作《通典》，切言“理道之先，在乎行教化；教化之本，在乎足衣食”（杜佑：《通典》“序”，中华书局1984年版，第9页），因以《食货》冠诸篇首；马端临《文献通考》因之，而益加详密，首论田赋、钱币、户口诸门，足征其要。
至于清代，理财之政既有旧制相因，又有新制继起，清季尤然。由逊清遗老主笔之《清史稿》，于其《食货志》中追溯称叹康乾盛世“永不加赋”之治；而论清季财政，则曰：“道、咸以降，海禁大开，国家多故。耗财之途广，而生财之道滞。……新政繁兴，孳孳谋利，而于古先圣王生众食寡、为疾用舒之道，昧焉不讲。”（赵尔巽等：《清史稿》卷120《食货一》，中华书局1977年版，3479页）诚然，从洋务运动到清末新政，五十年间百业待举，头绪纷繁，兴办教育尤为其中要项。所谓为政在人，育人由学，而兴学需财，清末尤亟。光绪二十二年（1896）九月，新授安徽巡抚邓华熙在赴任前陛见，君臣问对有此一节：
[光绪皇帝]又云：“凡事破除情面便好。用款必须节去浮费，款归实用才好。”奏云：“臣受皇上厚恩，当尽心竭力，用度可省便省，不至以有用之财办无益之事，有负委任。”上微点首，又云：“西学应办。”奏云：“学堂必须举办，才能造就人才。”上云：“苦于无经费。”奏云：“臣到任后察看情形，设法筹款奏明办理。”（邓华熙著，马莎整理：《邓华熙日记》，凤凰出版社2014年版，178页）

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[国学大师黄侃的父亲黄云鹄（1819-1898），是晚清咸丰、同治年间的名臣与诗文大家，然而晚年仕途坎坷，身后声名黯淡，最终《清史稿》亦未为立传，个中缘由，令人寻味不尽。他有一部特别的著作，名为《念昔斋寤言图纂》，记其家世生平游历见闻，有图画和文字纪事，几乎算得上是个人的画传。四川近代英年早逝的天才学者刘咸炘指出，它可能是模仿清人麟庆的《鸿雪因缘图记》而作（说见《内景楼检书记·史部》）。刘说颇有见地，试看两书图序的标题，都是整整齐齐的四个字，可为一证。此书对于研究黄侃家族历史有重要价值，然而今人有关黄侃生平学术的论著极少引用。
《念昔斋寤言图纂》（下文省称“《图纂》”）有清光绪元年（1875）建南官廨刻本、光绪十二年（1886）成都重刻本。前者有白描图画四十七幅，后者增补为六十九幅。前者影印收入《中华历史人物别传集》（线装书局2003年版）第五十五册，比较容易看到。
                  
这部《图纂》的图画，大多为黄云鹄作品（有些可能是门客所绘）。黄云鹄以诗文名世，兼擅书画艺事，是全才型的学者。三十年前，白彬师、景蜀慧师带领川大历史系本科同学去德阳市孝泉镇实习，我们在孝泉师范学校的教室里，还看到墙壁上镶嵌着黄云鹄诗作的巨幅石刻（诗题《孝泉谒姜公祠敬赋长律》，收入氏著《孝泉游草》），行书隽逸灵动，十分好看。
 
《图纂》光绪元年刻本最末一幅图画为《茅亭课易》，描绘的是黄云鹄教子研读《易经》的情形。画中三人，亭内端坐、手持经书、有髭须者为黄云鹄；中间肃立于书桌前者，当为黄侃兄长中一人；亭外的女性，疑为黄云鹄母胡氏（光绪《黄州府志》卷三〇《人物志》有传，说她“尤喜听诸孙诵书史”）。黄侃出生，正是在《图纂》重刻之时，黄云鹄已年近古稀。光绪十七年，黄云鹄致仕归里，先后客居江宁、武昌等地讲学，去世之时黄侃十三岁。黄侃早年多数时间，都在湖北蔪春乡间读书，远不如诸兄有机会从父…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[如果你正在寻找一种快速的从你的 Windows 计算机传输文件到你的 Linux 计算机的方法，那么开源的 WinSCP 实用程序会使其很容易地通过网络传输文件或文件夹。


有时，你需要通过文件传输文件。有很多文件共享服务，但是大多数的共享服务都要求你发送你的文件到互联网上。当两台计算机并排在一起或在一栋建筑物中时，通过互联网传输文件，这似乎看起来绕了很远的路（更不用说隐私问题）。开源的 WinSCP 实用程序会使其很轻易地通过网络将一个文件或一个文件夹从你的 Windows 计算机传输到你的 Linux 计算机。

IP 地址

在你可以传输之前，你必须知道目标计算机的 IP 地址或完全限定域名。假设它是一台在你的同一个网络上的计算机，并且你没有运行 DNS 服务器来解析计算机名称，你可以在 Linux 计算机上使用 ip 命令来找到目标 IP 地址：

[linux]$ ip addr show |grep 'inet '
inet 127.0.0.1/8 scope host lo  
inet 192.168.1.23/24 brd 10.0.1.255 scope global noprefixroute eth0


127.0.0.1 是一个 环回地址loopback address ，计算机仅使用它来自我通信，因此在这个示例中，正确的地址是 192.168.1.23 。在你的系统中，IP 地址可能会看起来有所不同。如果你不确定哪个是哪个，你可以逐个尝试到你找到正确的 IP 地址 （然后，在一些地方写下来！）

或者，你可以查找你的路由器设置，它列出了所有通过 DHCP 分配的地址。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I love linux. However there are so many quirks on the laptop that it gets annoying. I don't want to invest the time to fix all of them if it's not so simple. There are issues with the laptop not sleeping, browsers acting weird when plugged into a monitor, mic and camera issues on Zoom, bluetooth connection issues, etc. Are there less problems on a desktop? I really want to build a PC and run linux on it, but if it's as problematic, it may not be worth it. My distro is Ubuntu.
 On the PC, I'd mainly use it for web browsing and programming, so some issues would be mitigated by transferring some work to a work laptop like for Zoom and work related programming.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[systemd 的速度和易用性使其成为管理现代 Linux 系统的流行方式。




系统管理员知道，在一台运行着的现代计算机上会发生很多事情：应用程序在后台运行、预定事件等待在特定时间被触发、事件写入日志文件、发送状态报告。在以前，不同的进程可以通过一系列 Unix 工具，来进行有效地管理和监控。然而，现代的计算机运作更为复杂了：本地服务与容器化应用程序一同运行、能够轻松访问云及其运行的集群、实时进程、以及有比以往都多的数据。

拥有统一的管理方法不但是用户想要的，也是忙碌的系统管理员所迫切渴望的。为了完成这项重要的任务，系统守护进程system daemon （systemd） 被开发出来，并迅速被所有主要的 Linux 发行版所采用了。

当然，systemd 并不是管理 Linux 系统的唯一方式，还有许多其他可供选择的初始化系统，包括 sysvinit、OpenRC、runit、s6 和 BusyBox，但 systemd 将 Linux 视为一个统一的数据集，意味着 systemd 能用强大的工具对 Linux 进行一致的操作和查询。对于忙碌的系统管理员和许多用户来说，systemd 的速度和易用性是一个重要的特性。有以下的五个原因。

启动管理

启动 Linux 计算机可能是一件非常罕见的事情。服务器的正常运行时间通常以 年 来计算，而不是月或周。笔记本电脑和台式机可能会频繁地关闭和启动，但更多的时候它们是被挂起或休眠了。无论哪种类型，最近一次开机的时刻都可用于检查一段时间内的计算机健康情况，因为当你在监视系统或诊断问题时，这一时刻能够限制查看的数据量大小，从而让你快速地找到问题所在。

如果你不记得上次启动计算机的时间，你可以使用 systemd 的日志记录工具 journalctl，来列出计算机的所有启动会话：

My earliest exposure to Linux was in 2003 when the MIS manager at a company I was interning at gave me 3 CDs with Redhat Linux 7.2. I never installed it until about 2004 when my dad got a way more powerful computer (Dell Dimension 8300) and ended up getting it to successfully install in VirtualPC. I should mention I did attempt to install it on my home PC at the time, a Zenith GT Workstation my mom got for me through a church donation. Either the computer was too old or I was clueless how to get it to work. I do remember the anaconda installer defaulting to a text based setup because the PC was not powerful enough to run the GUI. I think at that point I gave up.

Latex doesn't render properly, scrolling is choppy, special text formatting (ie. code) doesn't really work, jumping between pages is buggy, etc. The only real advantage I can see is that with ebooks, you can make a section breakless and scrollable which is nice when reading code, whereas pdfs just split it onto multiple pages.

released for testing.



	There is really nothing here that makes me at all worried, except
	that it's just a bit more than I'm comfortable with. It should just
	have slowed down more by now.

	As a result, I'm now pretty sure that this is going to be one of
	those "we'll have an extra week and I'll make an rc8"
	releases. Which then in turn means that now the next merge window
	will be solidly in the holiday season.]]></summary>

 I’m retired now and looking for a simple database/web implementation to play around with some scripting. I’ve been away from Linux for about four years, have MySQL and Perl been replaced by other (just as simple) things? I don’t want a full-time job to implement, just a hobby to toy with.

 So,..(please confirm if this is indeed the case), clone system call is essentially the way for a process to spawn a thread (unlike fork for spawning a process).. and clone accepts parameters w.r.t what exactly it needs to share from the parent, virtual address space being the bare minimum. Turns out, the so-called "thread" is indeed a process in Linux. Inspection of htop, shows that even threads have PIDs. So everything is ultimately a process?

Or rather it will just boot to its console and you'll have to load the main grub.cfg yourself. To avoid this you'll need to mount your ESP read-write and reinstall the bootloader after making that change. Note: update-grub doesn't do this for you.
 I can appreciate why the Grub devs did it this way, but that behaviour was completely opposite to my expectations, considering that most distributions mount the ESP read-only by default, if at all. Anyway, I wasted yesterday evening figuring that out.

I have made it 2/3 of the way; i have changed the settings in the BIOS to start when it get connected to power and I have figured out autologin. The machine will be hidden in a closet and connected to a flat screen tv in a waiting room. When the power is turned on, it should start up and automatically start playing the contents of a folder (or an USB stick?) using the default player (or better) in ubuntu. 
 (tried first with vlc but it was so slow that it was one frame per second. Then tried the built-in player and it did fine). Maybe mplayer will work fine? I don't know yet. 
 I am experienced with Windows but I am a complete n00b when it comes to Linux. So, please explain it like you're explaining it to a toddler. Thanks in advance for helping me :)

But there's a difference between me now and the me 2 years ago. Back then, I loved compiling every program, be as "bloat"-free as possible, did everything from the command line, thinking it was the more efficient way for everything. Now that I think about it, I don't enjoy doing that stuff anymore cuz it just takes up too much time. I now prefer to use GUI apps for almost everything. Stuff like zathura and suckless apps doesn't appeal to me now. What do you think?

 Did some investigating and found the following:

 I believe this is what causes the accuracy to be abysmally poor.

Am getting into CDs again just for the fun of the nostalgia, and I discovered lightscribe is a thing and it looks pretty rad(printing images in gray-scale on the top part of the CD through the CD burner using the laser for those who don't know), but I can't find any software currently available to do it on GNU/Linux, it seems the one from LaCie is not hosted anywhere anymore, the lightscribe website is dead, not sure if it still could run on current distros anyway ...
 ​
 I only use GNU/Linux OSes and I'd like to avoid making a Windows VM just for that, is there a solution? By the way I saw Arch has packages in the AUR that would make it work it seems but am on Fedora and a DNF and flathub search for lightscribe don't return any results :/
 ​
 Can I run some CD burning program from Windows with Wine to do it maybe?
 And by the way am not sure that my computer's CD burner is compatible with lightscribe, I bought it a decade ago to put it in my self-assembled PC, I remember it didn't even came in a proper box back then, just unlabeled cardboard, only thing I know is that it's from Samsung IIRC, is there some way through software means to determine if it supports lightscribe?

 Thanks for the help!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[当地时间11月26日，推特首席执行官埃隆·马斯克表示，该社交媒体平台的新用户注册数量达到了“历史最高水平”，并对推特2.0计划的部分内容进行了介绍。


据马斯克在推特上分享了该公司的多张用户数据分析走势图显示，截至11月16日的7天内，推特新用户注册人数平均每日超200万，比2021年同期增长66%。用户活跃时间也达到了历史最高水平，在截至11月15日的7天内，平均每天有近80亿分钟的活跃时间，同比增加了30%。马斯克还预计推特在未来12到18个月内月活跃用户数将超过10亿。


不仅如此，马斯克还分享了推特2.0“万能应用”(everthing app)的部分内容，根据PPT介绍，在Twitter 2.0中，软件将加入包括长推文、视频、支付、加密私信等功能，并在蓝标认证和广告服务等方面做出优化。


不难看出，马斯克将此前大量的想法融入了Twitter 2.0中，试图将其从一个社交平台“改造”为一个综合性平台。


马斯克还称，推特正在应对广告收入下滑的情况。由于部分广告商因用户身份验证等新规则而离开推特，包括通用汽车、大众汽车公司等大公司暂停在平台投放广告，致使该公司广告收入大幅下滑。


据了解，数百名推特员工已经离开这家陷入困境的公司，此前马斯克发出最后通牒，要求员工签署“长时间高强度工作”的协议，否则就离开公司。


值得一提的是，该公司在11月初裁掉了一半员工，包括负责沟通、内容策划、人权和机器学习伦理的团队，以及一些产品和工程团队。

I want to show you MyNixOS.com - a website I've been working on this year to make it easy to create and share Nix and NixOS configurations. Nix is a powerful tool to deploy software in a reproducible way, and with NixOS you can control your whole operating system through a declarative configuration.
Starting out with Nix was exciting, but it definitely had a challenging learning curve. This made me start building a website focused on making it easier to create and share Nix flakes, which are the core unit of software deployment in Nix.
Using the website, you can create flakes without knowing the Nix configuration language, as the necessary Nix files are generated for you. A few examples of what you can do right now:

        <link href="https://linux.cn/article-15294-1.html?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss"/>
        <updated>2022-11-27T03:37:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[htop 是一个流行的命令行工具，可以帮助监测 Linux 上的系统资源和性能。

它比通常默认开箱即用的 top 好。

使用 htop，你可以对进程进行过滤和排序，以便更好地了解情况，获得正在运行的进程的树状视图，并在需要时杀死进程。



我使用 htop 而不是其他系统监控工具，因为它可以显示对我来说至关重要的东西，并允许在我需要控制运行中的服务时终止流氓进程或冻结进程。

但是，如果你想要其他显示更多信息，或一个看起来不同的东西，有哪些htop 替代品呢？让我们来看看。

1、atop



atop 可以提供所有运行的进程的细节。你可以得到你需要的所有数据，以了解你系统上的进程情况。

它还提供了对资源利用率进行永久记录的能力，以便进行长期分析。系统管理员可能会发现这比其他工具更有用。

不幸的是，它并没有为你提供漂亮的输出。因此，如果你想要的话，请继续看下面的其他替代品。

如何安装 atop？

对于基于 Ubuntu/Debian 的发行版，键入：

sudo apt install atop


2、vtop



如果你想要一个漂亮的输出和管理进程的基本功能，vtop 是一个完美的系统监控工具。

正如我在其他一些文章中所说，它的输出看起来像终端中的 GUI。你可以使用鼠标，也可以选择禁用它。也可以定制它的主题。

它是用 Node.js 构建的。所以，你需要安装额外的包来安装它。

不幸的是，这个项目似乎不再积极维护。但是，在写这篇文章的时候，它对我来说还是有用的。

如何安装 vtop？

对于基于 Ubuntu 的发行版，在终端输入以下命令：

sudo apt install nodejs
sudo apt install npm
sudo npm install -g vtop


3、btop++



btop++ 是 bashtop 和 bpytop 的一个 C++ 版本。是的，它是这些项目的第三次迭代，由同一个开发者完成。

btop++ 包括完全的鼠标支持，带有一个受游戏启发的菜单系统，可以让你过滤进程、树状视图等等。

如何安装 btop++？

使用官方软件库，你可以很容易地在 Fedora、openSUSE 和 FreeBSD 上安装它。

对于 Fedora，你可以键入：

sudo dnf install btop


你可以探索它的 GitHub 页面，了解在其他 Linux 发行版上的安装方式。

4、Glances



Glances 与 htop 类似，但有更多的功能。

它是一个跨平台的系统监控工具，可以将数据以 CSV 或其他格式导出，用于 InfluxDB、Elasticsearch 等。

你也可以利用它的网页用户界面，远程（或在不能访问终端的情况下）查看统计数据。

如何安装 Glances？

对于基于 Ubuntu 的发行版，你可以键入：

sudo apt install glances


5、nmon



nmon 是一个令人印象深刻的监测工具，它可以让你控制你想显示的输出内容。

你可以提取监测数据（以 CSV 格式导出）并用于进一步分析。它很容易切换统计数据和在不同的视图之间进行切换。

默认情况下，它每两秒刷新一次数据，但你可以自定义它，并使用更多的选项来调整你的体验。

如何安装 nmon？

你可以在官方软件库中找到它。对于基于 Ubuntu 的发行版，在终端键入以下内容：

sudo apt install nmon


总结

top 2022

top 命令工具被植入在你的 Linux 系统中。如果你想要一个基本的监控工具，想要关注系统进程和一些统计信息，top 就足够了。

我不确定它是否可以算作比 htop 更强的体验，这也是 top 没有被列入主要列表的原因。

正如你在这里看到的，一些监控工具可能很有趣，而且证明比 htop 更有洞察力。

你最喜欢的 htop 替代品是什么？你认为 htop 对你的使用情况来说已经足够了吗？欢迎在下面的评论中让我知道你的想法。

Pantheon 是 elementary OS 使用的一个漂亮的桌面环境。它基于 GTK3（GTK4 移植正在进行中）和 Vala，是一个漂亮而干净的桌面，为你提供了一个精致的 Linux 桌面体验。

该桌面主要由 elementary OS 使用。elementary OS 提供了 Pantheon 桌面的修改版，它是基于 GNOME 的。

elementary OS 基于 Ubuntu LTS 版本。因此，在基于 Ubuntu 的发行版中安装 Pantheon 桌面是超级容易的。这意味着如果你想在不安装 elementary OS 的情况下体验 Pantheon，在 Ubuntu 中这只需要一两个命令就可以安装。

在 Fedora 中，你也可以使用组包进行安装。然而，一个以 Fedora 为基础，名为 Ultramarine Linux 的发行版默认提供了它。

但是，在 Arch Linux 中安装 Pantheon 需要一些工作。它不是用简单的 pacman 命令就能直接完成的，而且不能开箱即用。需要一些配置，这可能会破坏你的系统。

这里我给你提供了在 Arch Linux 中安装 Pantheon 桌面的指南和步骤。

警告： 第一次可能不顺利，所以我建议你在物理系统上安装前先在虚拟机上进行。因为在 Arch 中安装 Pantheon 并不像在 Arch Linux 中安装 GNOME、Xfce 和 KDE Plasma 桌面那样流畅。它还需要一些额外的手动配置。

Even using an Apple computer there are ways to get installer ISOs, but not on this Dell; unreliable online disk image driver hackery only.

 My parents are not computer literate. That translated into lots of regular issues with their Windows computers. When we made the switch to Linux, I had to show them where to click or how to navigate the GUI in a couple of cases or do some basic setup work, and field the occasional question.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[For other HN'ers out there who have personal projects on Heroku and might've forgotten (like I did), this weekend is the last chance to get data out of Heroku (or upgrade to paid plans) before it deletes databases/Redis and shuts down free dynos on Monday.
> What products are impacted by the removal of free plans?
>> `free` dynos, `hobby-dev` Heroku Postgres, and `hobby-dev` Heroku Data for Redis plans.
>> What happens if I take no action on my free apps or databases or do not upgrade to a paid plan?
>> If you take no action by November 28, 2022:
>> - `free` dynos will be converted to `eco` dynos scaled down to 0. You must subscribe to the Eco dyno hours plan or upgrade to another paid plan before you can scale them up again. Any Scheduler jobs that used free dynos will fail until they are reconfigured to use another dyno type.
> - For non-Enterprise users, `hobby-dev` databases will be deleted in accordance with the Heroku Documentation starting November 28, 2022.
> - For Enterprise users, `hobby-dev` databases that belong to an Enterprise Account or Team will be converted to `mini`. There will be no immediate change in cost to your Heroku Enterprise invoices if an app is upgraded from a free tier resource to a paid tier resource. Any changes to Heroku Enterprise pricing would require a contract update to take effect. If you have any concerns about your contract pricing, contact your account executive.
> - `hobby-dev` databases that belong to personal accounts will be deleted, and `free dynos` will be converted to `eco` dynos scaled down to 0, even if that user also belongs to an Enterprise Team. These users must upgrade to paid resources before November 28, 2022.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Western Digital latest Enterprise disks introduced a "technology" called OptiNAND. In their manual (pdf) they are not saying much about it (or at least I could not find anything) other than eg. the HC560 has 64GB flash on board, in their data sheet (pdf) I copy-pasted below what they are saying about it.
 My question if they are storing this so called "metadata" (whatever that is) on flash storage how would that affect full disk encryption security? Any concerns? Wonder how that even works if everything is encrypted on the disk. Or maybe this metadata is just a kind of "index table" of the sectors but has zero relevance of the sector content?
 For the sake of simplicity let's assume:
  
no intentional malicious code is on these HDDs' firmware
 dm-crypt full disk encryption (+LUKS)
 no known exploit in dm-crypt
 highly sensitive company data (so you are not hiding something from your girlfriend :D)
  
From their data sheet:
 "OptiNAND integrates an iNAND® Universal Flash Storage (UFS) Embedded Flash Drive (EFD) with traditional spinning disk media, and incorporates innovative changes to the firmware algorithm and system-on-a-chip (SoC). OptiNAND is not a hybrid technology*. The drive works smarter, with enhanced firmware algorithms taking advantage of* expanded metadata that has been offloaded to the iNAND*, enabling more tracks per inch (TPI), resulting in increased areal density. The Ultrastar DC HC560, with the first implementation of OptiNAND technology’s capacity-enabling features, delivers an unbeaten 20TB capacity in a nine-disk platform (2.2TB/platter) with CMR recording format."*

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Some time ago I wanted to give the aerc email client a try, but then I deleted it when I found out that it stores the password in plain text. But now I wonder, how do other applications store sensitive information like passwords? For example in KMail I only entered my password initially and the application stored it somewhere.
 The obvious solution is to store data encrypted, but how does the application decrypt it again? It would need some cryptographic key, but then we have just kicked the can down the road: the key itself needs to be either plain text or it needs to be encrypted again, which necessitates another key or a password.
 In this comment the author of aerc says that the config file must have permissions 600 (read+write for owner, nothing for rest of system), so it is not readable by the rest of the system. Is this what other applications do as well? A malicious application I have installed which has access to the file system could just read my settings and an attacker who gets physical access to my machine (e.g. a thief) could just hook up the hard drive to his computer and bypass and OS permissions. For the latter I would have to encrypt my hard drive, and for the former I guess I have to be careful what I run and not just trust "lol, the password is encrypted". Am I correct?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Folks, i'm so thankful to have come across linux by chance. Few years ago I purchased a Chromebook because I was broke and couldn't afford to replace windows laptop.
 I got tired of Chromebooks limitations so I looked around and came across crouton only few months ago. It began my journey of steep learning curve and may hours of frustrations.
 I persisted and ended up running various distros but settled on lubuntu. Works flawlessly on my Chromebook.
 I plan to buy a good laptop and install either Pop!Os or Mint.
 Biggest benefit for me - I struggle with hyperactivity and I'm easy distracted and overstimulated.
 Linux is basically like taking a ADHD medication for me - clutter free and no distratction. I love it.
 EDIT: btw watched and read about the development of GNU/Linux. Very interesting and I think Linus Torvalds is real deal.
 What tips do you have for an enthustiastic newbie?

NordPass 发布了 2022 年最常见的密码名单，排名第一的是 “password”，其次是 “123456”、“123456789”、“guest”、“qwerty” 以及更多不需要破解工具就能知道的密码。除此以外，还有很多设备的默认密码也很流行。此外，密码也经常随着流行趋势而变化，比如奥斯卡颁奖、流行电影等等。

谷歌称互联网的六成是重复内容

谷歌工程师 Gary Illyes 在一次演讲中称，互联网上六成的内容是重复的。但他没有对重复进行定义。互联网上有大量重复内容是众所周知的事实，问题是比例有多大，作为最大最流行的搜索引擎，谷歌给出了它的答案。


消息来源：SE Roundtable



老王点评：毕竟互联网的主要内容来自 ICP —— Internet Copy & Paste。🤣




Ubuntu Touch 发布新版本，但仍基于六年前的 Ubuntu

这个可以在智能手机和平板电脑上运行的 Linux 发行版推出了最新版本 OTA-24，继续支持来自华硕、谷歌、LG、一加、三星、索尼、小米和其他供应商的各种设备。这个版本继续基于 Ubuntu 16.04 LTS，向 Ubuntu 20.04 LTS 的过渡仍在进行。


消息来源：Phoronix



老王点评：能继续保持更新已属不易，过渡到新的 Ubuntu 版本确实需要很长时间。没有商业公司支持的开源项目，往往很难。]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[据华尔街日报中文网援引The Information报道称，Alphabet旗下的谷歌正在考虑裁员1万人，占其全球员工总数的6%。


报道指出，此举将基于一个排名系统，该系统将淘汰排名最低的“表现不佳”的员工。


报道还称，谷歌发言人在一份声明中表示，“今年早些时候，我们推出了谷歌评估和发展系统，以帮助员工获得全年的发展、辅导、学习和职业进步。这一新系统有助于建立明确的期望，并为员工提供定期反馈。”


另据美国消费者新闻与商业频道(CNBC)报道称，谷歌公司内部的焦虑情绪正在上升。


上述报道提到，谷歌的业务受到的打击并不像许多同行那样严重，但潜在的衰退、通胀飙升和利率上升的综合影响正在产生明显的影响。


此外，Alphabet的高管们近期还强调，公司需要更专注，降低各种项目的成本，并使公司的效率提高20%。其首席执行官皮查伊曾表示，“显而易见的是，我们正面临着一个具有挑战性的宏观环境，未来将有更多的不确定性。”


Alphabet的净利也在下降。三季报显示，其第三季营收为690.9亿美元，低于市场预期的705.8亿美元，去年同期为651.2亿美元；净利润从去年同期的189.4亿美元大幅下滑至139.1亿美元。


近期，包括Meta、推特、亚马逊、Carvana、思科、Lyft和Stripe在内的科技公司都陷入了裁员风波，这影响了全球数以万计的工作岗位。


对此，华尔街日报分析指出，疫情开始后，随着用户的消费行为都转向线上，科技公司的收入和员工人数出现了爆发式增长。但如今，疫情红利逐渐消退，科技巨头们不得不裁减数以千计的员工。

远程桌面客户端允许你连接到任何其他桌面/服务器，并远程执行任务。它是一种重要的 IT 支持和商业用例。在 Linux 中，有许多远程桌面客户端可用。其中一些是免费的，而另一些是付费版本。所有这些客户端都支持流行的 远程桌面协议Remote Desktop Protocol（RDP），如 VNC、RDP 等等。

本文将介绍一些适用于 Ubuntu 和其他发行版的最佳免费远程桌面客户端。该列表包括自由开源的应用程序，以及一些免费使用但专有的应用程序。

注意：你的目标系统中需要一个远程桌面服务器（如 Xrdp）来成功建立远程连接。然后你才能使用以下应用程序进行连接。这是一个双向的过程。如果你想了解更多的情况，请参考我们的一个案例研究：


通过 RDP 从 Windows 连接到 Ubuntu


适用于 Linux 的最佳远程桌面客户端

GNOME Connections



第一个远程桌面客户端是一个原生的 GNOME 应用程序：GNOME 连接Connections 应用。这个基于 GTK 的应用程序带来了一个简单的用户界面。它是一个非常适合初学者的应用程序。它可以在一分钟内快速设置和连接（如果你知道 IP 和其他细节）。

此外，它还提供了清晰的指示，说明你是要连接到 Linux 还是 Windows。GNOME 连接应用支持 VNC（针对 Linux）和 RDP（针对 Windows）协议。

用 Flatpak 安装这个应用程序超级简单。设置你的系统以使用 Flatpak，并使用以下命令进行安装：

flatpak install flathub org.gnome.Connections

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A little bit of background. 
 Some years ago, Ubuntu had Amazon integration with Unity’s search feature. This caused quite an uproar in the Linux community with the eventual removal of Amazon (at least from what I am aware, I apologize if I am wrong). 
 The Amazon integration should never happened due to Amazon’s war on privacy with them being arguably the least privacy-friendly company in existence. For Ubuntu to even think it was a good idea for the integration is an insult and a disconnect to the entire Linux community and what most Linux users try to go for. 
 Next they created the Snap store. Although the store is open source (100% a plus!), they have forced the proprietorship of the store, meaning that in order to get software on the snap store, you MUST go through Ubuntu. This is, again, an unpopular view with the community, with some popular distros, such as Linux Mint, disabling the store by default. 
 By these continuous decisions that are so disconnected from what a lot, if not most, Linux users want and are looking for when ditching Microsoft and Apple, and especially the past integration with Amazon, I feel that Ubuntu should not be listed as a trustworthy distro when it comes to privacy. 
 Now I’m not looking to specifically shit on Ubuntu and Canonical, moreoverso, I’m trying to get other views from the community and those who have chosen to stick it out with Ubuntu and why considering their recent anti-community practices. 
 Please this post was made in good faith, and I have used Ubuntu before (mostly Kubuntu KDE for the win) and I’m just looking for Ubuntu users (or Ubuntu spins users) with their opinions on Canonical and their past. 
 Thank you in advance and if this breaks the rules, please mods delete :)

        <id>https://linux.cn/article-15290-1.html?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss</id>
        <link href="https://linux.cn/article-15290-1.html?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss"/>
        <updated>2022-11-26T01:56:57.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Fedora Silverblue 是 基于 Fedora Linux 构建的桌面操作系统。它非常适合日常使用、开发和基于容器的工作流程。它提供了 众多优势，例如能够在出现任何问题时回滚。如果你想在 Fedora Silverblue 系统上更新或变基到 Fedora Linux 37（这些说明与 Fedora Kinoite 类似），本文将告诉你如何操作。它不仅向你展示了该做什么，而且还向你展示了在发生不可预见的事情时如何恢复。

在实际对 Fedora Linux 37 进行变基之前，你应该应用任何待定的更新。在终端中输入以下内容：

$ rpm-ostree update


或通过 GNOME 软件Software 应用安装更新并重新启动。

使用 GNOME 软件应用变基

在更新页面上，GNOME 软件Software 应用向你显示有新版本的 Fedora Linux 可用。



你需要做的第一件事是下载新镜像，因此请点击“下载Download”按钮。这需要一些时间。完成后，你将看到更新已准备好安装。



点击 “重启并更新Restart & Upgrade” 按钮。此步骤只需要几分钟，最后计算机将重启。重启后，你将获得全新的 Fedora Linux 37 版本。很简单，不是吗？

使用终端变基

如果你喜欢在终端中完成所有操作，那么本指南的这一部分适合你。

使用终端变基到 Fedora Linux 37 很容易。首先，检查 37 分支是否可用：

$ ostree remote refs fedora


你应该在输出中看到以下内容：

fedora:fedora/37/x86_64/silverblue


如果你想置顶当前部署（该部署将作为 GRUB 中的选项保留，直到你删除它），你可以通过运行以下命令来完成：

# 0 is entry position in rpm-ostree status
$ sudo ostree admin pin 0


要删除置顶部署，请使用以下命令：

# 2 is entry position in rpm-ostree status
$ sudo ostree admin pin --unpin 2


其中 2 是 rpm-ostree 状态中的位置。

接下来，将你的系统重新设置为 Fedora Linux 37 分支。

$ rpm-ostree rebase fedora:fedora/37/x86_64/silverblue


最后，要做的最后一件事是重新启动计算机并引导至 Fedora Linux 37。

如何回滚

如果发生任何不好的事情，例如，如果你根本无法启动到 Fedora Linux 37，这很容易回滚。在引导时选择 GRUB 菜单中的上一个条目（如果你没有看到它，请尝试在引导过程中按 ESC），你的系统将以切换到 Fedora Linux 37 之前的先前状态启动。要使此更改永久生效，请使用以下命令：

$ rpm-ostree rollback


就是这样。现在你知道如何将 Fedora Silverblue 变基到 Fedora Linux 37 并回滚。那么为什么不在今天做呢？

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[当地时间周五（11月25日），美国联邦通信委员会（FCC）宣布，禁止华为、中兴通讯、海康威视、海能达和浙江大华五家公司在美国销售设备。


FCC称这五家的产品“对美国国家安全构成不可接受的风险”。FCC此举的依据是其于2019年颁布的一项旨在保护美国通信网络安全的法律。


早在FCC做出这一决定之前，华为、中兴通讯、海康威视、海能达和浙江大华五家公司就已被列入所谓“对美国国家安全造成威胁的安全风险”清单，进入清单的公司被认定对美国国家通信安全构成威胁。除了上述五家公司外，中国移动、中国电信和中国联通也被列入了该清单。


去年由拜登政府正式把安全装置法签署生效之后，FCC联邦通信委员会在全票通过之后，于今天正式引用条文禁止多家中国企业的电讯和视像监控产品获得认证，换句话说就是要在当地禁售今后的产品，当中点名华为、中兴、大华、海康威视（Hikvision）和海能达（Hytera）。


FCC主席Jessica Rosenworcel在新闻稿中提到，他们的行动是为了保护美国国家安全，拒绝境内出现不被信任的通讯装置，特别是使用联邦基金的地方。 Rosenworcel提到会寻求重新审视，甚至是撤销涵盖名单（covered list）上产品的进网准许。


今年3月，FCC将中国电信美洲公司和中国移动国际（美国）有限公司列入“对美国国家安全造成威胁的安全风险”清单。


今年9月20日，FCC再次将中国联通美洲运营有限公司与中资电信企业太平洋网络有限公司及其全资子公司信通列入上述清单。

这个名为 Pitchfork 的秘密项目现已转到谷歌实验室，旨在 “教代码自己编写代码和重写”。Pitchfork 能够通过机器学习技术训练 AI 编写代码、修复 Bug，以及更新代码。其最初目标是构建一款工具，可以将谷歌的 Python 编程语言代码库更新到较新的版本。但随着时间的推移，该项目的目标转向了一个通用系统：可以减少人类开发者编写和更新代码的需要，同时又能保持代码质量。

谷歌安全团队称谷歌等安卓手机厂商迟迟没有修补漏洞

谷歌的 Project Zero 团队说，他们在 6、7 月间发现了 5 个新问题，并告知了 ARM 公司。ARM 在 7、8 月间发布了修复程序。然而，在三个月后，包括三星、小米、Oppo 和谷歌在内的智能手机制造商还没有部署补丁来修复这些漏洞。这些漏洞可以使恶意黑客绕过安卓系统的权限模型，获得对系统的完全访问权。

老王点评：安全问题的解决链路，光是上游着急也不行。




GitHub 正在测试在 Markdown 中嵌入 JavaScript

GitHub 正在内测在其仓库内的 Markdown 文件内嵌入 JavaScript 代码，这被称之为 “GitHub Blocks”。Markdown 通常用来做代码仓库的说明和文档。通过嵌入 JavaScript，调用 GitHub 提供的 RESTful API，可以使 Markdown 文件变成动态的。它的用例包括渲染字体和颜色，在格式化的表格中显示 JSON 数据，显示仓库分析，如贡献者、问题统计、提交和拉动请求，显示图表，以及动态演示应用功能。

老王点评：这样就把 Markdown 变成富文本的，动态的了，是不是和 Markdown 本身的初衷背道而驰了？]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[我们列出了 2022 年适用于 Linux 和 Windows 的六个最佳 Python 代码编辑器。


如今，Python 无处不在，它可以说是现代版的 C 语言编程语言。从网站、应用程序、数据科学项目、人工智能到物联网设备，你可以发现 Python 无处不在。因此，作为这十年来流行的编程语言，了解 Python 的开发环境是很有必要的，开发人员用它创建应用程序，特别是如果你是刚刚开始学习 Python 编程，更需要了解 Python 开发环境。

许多 Python 开发环境都提供了可以满足你需求的功能和工具。其中有些环境对学习 Python 的初学者很有用，而另外一些用户则适用于重型 Python 开发和复杂的设置。在这里，在这篇文章中，我将谈一谈其中最好的几个，这将有助于你根据自己的需要和使用情况选择一个。

最好的 Python 编码编辑器

这个榜单上有以下几个编辑器：


Visual Studio Code

Eclipse

PyCharm

Spyder

Sublime Text

Thonny


1、Visual Studio Code



尽管它是微软创造的，但 Visual Studio Code 是最好的代码编辑器之一。不仅是 Python，对于所有流行和趋势的编程语言都是。

它具有语法高亮、代码补完、调试、代码片段、内置 Git 等诸如此类的功能。对于新手来说，它有点复杂，但也只需几个小时就能学会。

然而，它是用 Electron 框架构建的，可能会感觉稍微慢一些。但在高端的开发硬件下这不是问题。它是一个自由开源的应用程序，适用于 Linux、macOS 和 Windows。

以下是适用于 Ubuntu、Fedora 和相关发行版的单个 deb 和 RPM 包：

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[这是有关如何在 Oracle VirtualBox 中启用 USB 的指南。




当你在虚拟机环境中工作时，USB 通常插入主机系统。但是从客体系统访问 USB 内容有点困难。

在 VirtualBox 中，你需要安装一些扩展并启用一些设置才能访问 USB。方法如下。

本文假设你已经安装了 VirtualBox，并且还在其中安装了一些 Linux 发行版或操作系统。

如果没有，请查看 这篇文章。


请注意，Oracle VM VirtualBox 扩展包采用 Oracle 的个人使用和评估许可证（PUEL）。该许可证与 VirtualBox 不同，后者采用的是 GPL。如果你将下面的步骤用于商业目的，请确保你仔细阅读 本页面。


在 VirtualBox 7.0 中启用 USB

安装 VirtualBox 扩展包

打开 VirtualBox 下载页面并从 此链接 下载适用于所有支持平台的 VirtualBox 扩展包。



然后单击 “文件File > 工具Tools > 扩展包管理器Extension Pack Manager”。

单击工具栏中的 “安装Install” 按钮并选择下载的 .vbox-extpak 文件。

点击 “安装Install”。接受条款，并为安装提供管理员密码。





安装成功后，可以在已安装列表中看到。

重启主机系统。重启是强制性的。

在客体机中启用 USB

将 U 盘插入你的宿主机系统，你希望从虚拟机中访问该系统。

启动 VirtualBox 并右键单击要启用 USB 的虚拟机名称。选择“设置Settings”。



在左窗格中，单击 USB。然后选择控制器版本。例如，你可以选择 USB 3.0。然后单击小加号图标添加 USB 过滤器。

在此列表中，你应该看到你的 U 盘名称（你插入的）。对于这个例子，我可以看到我插入的 Transcend Jetflash 驱动器。

选择它并按 “OK”。



现在，启动你的虚拟机。打开文件管理器，你应该会看到 U 盘已启用并挂载到你的虚拟机上。

在此演示中，你可以看到我的 Arch-Xfce 虚拟机的 Thunar 文件管理器正在显示我的 U 盘中的内容。



使用说明

现在，这里有几件事你应该记住。

当你在主机系统中插入 U 盘时，请保持挂载状态。但在启动虚拟机之前不要打开或访问任何文件。

启动虚拟机后，U 盘将在主机系统中卸载并自动挂载到客体系统中，即你的虚拟机。

使用完 U 盘后，确保在虚拟机中将其弹出或卸载。然后它将能再从你的主机系统内访问。

总结

VirtualBox 是一个功能强大的程序，提供易于使用的功能来设置的你虚拟机。这些步骤很简单，并确保你的 U 盘在主机系统中被正确检测到以正常工作。

另外，请记住，通过扩展包检测 U 盘与 VirtualBox 客户端增强包无关。它们完全不相关并提供独立的功能。

最后，如果本指南对你有帮助，请在评论栏中告诉我。

Long story short, Google froze my Google Pay account which is used to pay for anything related to Google services, including GCP. This was done as they need to temporarily suspend me to 'verify' me. The GCP team couldn't help me since it was an issue with Google Pay. Not to mention their chat support is useless and doesn't have any power to look into cases.
Now I login to find out my Google Pay account is 'temporarily suspended' since I need to verify my account. I go ahead and add my drivers license and fill out their form, but while they verify details they suspend your ability to pay for any Google services.
So now I can't pay for GCP usage (firebase) and all my authentication, database, cloud functions, are all not usable since the service is suspended. Unlike Amazon who offers phone lines for resolving billing issues, Google does no such thing. I wish I chose AWS.
The end result is that I have apps I spent years of my life building and which currently feed me to only be rendered unusable because some AI at google thought my Google Pay needed additional verification.
My whole life has done a 180 in the past week. I feel like I'm a man with literally nothing to lose and I can't live with myself anymore. This hurts much more than losing a job for me.
Please stay far, far away from Google services of any kind. They are by far the worst of the big tech companies when it comes to developer support.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I wanted to see how difficult it would be to build a web app using a sub-$300 android smartphone. Decided to build a fun predictions website where you could bet virtual (not real) money on predictions made by others, and also make predictions of your own.
Building it turned out to be considerably easier and more fun than I anticipated.
Primary tools used were:
# QuickEdit as the mobile code editor (Note: the free version of the QuickEdit app is riddled with ads, it shows an advert each time you close a tab, but it unfortunately had the best UI of the 3 or so Android code editors I tested. Ended up using NetGuard to block it from retrieving & displaying ads),
# PHP for the Backend ( custom PHP microframework I've used and built on over the past few years ).
# jQuery for the frontend js (cringing) - it appears I'm simply too lazy to learn React/Vue/et al. Every once in a while, I pick one of them to learn, but I always end up returning to jQuery - or time-permitting - amateur level vanilla JS.
# Bootstrap for the CSS - Battle-tested. For a purely backend dev with minimal design skills, good ol' Bootstrap (and in a growing number of cases, Tailwind) is always a life saver.
# Whole thing is hosted on 2 VMs (1 hosting the web app, and 1 hosting Redis & MySQL).
# As to the site itself, it turned out to be pretty cool to play around with. Go there, view the predictions, bet on the predictions you believe will come true, or against the ones you think will not. You get $50,000 to bet with (not real money). No signup is required to bet, but a quick signup is required to make a prediction. Hope you guys like it, and please be ruthless in telling me of any bugs you've found.
So go on here => kudotap.com
And Have Fun!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Thanks in advance. I’m at the point of liking Linux and being comfortable enough with it to use as daily driver but I’m missing some 3rd party software I would need before I could completely give up on Mac OS. QuickBooks for my business accounting and Quicken for home finances are not available for Linux. What alternatives would you recommend? 
 Another is a calendar app which syncs with iCal calendar, which I believe uses the CalDAV protocol? Really if there are desktop apps that work with iCloud for calendar, notes, email, contacts, and messaging that would be amazing so I don’t have to rely on Google. I’m not skilled enough to get NextCloud working.

 I was in need of some screenshot software beyond the default mate-screenshot I have on Linux Mint and I decided to research a couple options. My goal is to be able to take screen-grabs without too much “fuzz” and paste them into a document I’m writing (e.g. into an email). At the same time, I want the option to add annotations to some of my screenshots. The two tools I decided to look into are Flameshot and Shutter.
 Flameshot
 Once you run it, it gets added to the system tray:

 When you click the icon, an intuitive dark overlay covers the screen but it also includes reminder on how to use the most common functions of the tool:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've played around with Linux before but never daily drove it cause I felt like it was too much of a pain with little gain to switch over, but a few days ago I decided to just try it properly once and for all. I partitioned a small 64GB on my laptop and daily drove it, and holy shit, its so good! I can customize it so much, boot time is noticeably faster and it runs most of my apps well. And the main part is that the OS is instantly usable as soon as it loads in, unlike Windows where I have to give it a few seconds for everything to settle down first. Linux is just underrated. 
 I dont know if this belongs here. But I am genuinely surprised big time by how good Linux is. Its honestly a no bullshit OS which I've been looking for all my life.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So yeah, GNOME, KDE etc accept donnations, but i wonder why does anybody tried making crowdfunding for linux problems that hurts users the most? For example why not to create crowdfunding to pay someone to make a fractional scaling for gnome (then of course it will be curated by GNOME Project), or any other problem that i just cannot recall. Basically same as donation, but users know for sure where their money goes.
 I dont think that i am the first person thinked about it, so does anyone knows why no one did this before?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[哪些是最基本的 Linux 的命令？

经常有读者问我这个问题，我一直试图避免回答这个问题。

为什么呢？我不知道 Linux 命令吗？不是的。这不是原因。而是因为很难对它们进行分类。对我来说必不可少的东西对你来说可能并不重要。

但我想这适用于所有的东西，我们网站上的每一个这样的推荐应用程序列表也都是这样。

这就是为什么我最终放弃了，并创建了这个基本但重要的 Linux 命令列表，它应该对作为 Linux 用户的你有所帮助。这更多的是针对 Ubuntu 这样的桌面用户，但如果你把 Ubuntu 作为服务器使用，它们也应该对你有所帮助。

Linux 的基本命令

我在这里列出的每个命令都有多个选项和多种用途。如果我尝试给出每个命令的最常见的例子，它将很容易变成一本超过一万字的口袋书。

我不会详述这些命令中的任何一个。我将列出每个命令的目的及其基本语法。你可以从这些命令的链接教程中阅读更多关于使用这些命令的信息。

在你开始阅读列表之前推荐阅读：


Linux 中路径的概念

文件权限的概念

了解 Linux 终端的行话


还有一件事。我在这里更多地使用了文件夹这个术语，而不是目录。

在 Linux 中文件夹被称为目录，有些人可能不喜欢这样。然而，我相信对于初学者来说，这更容易掌握。

1、ls 命令：列出一个文件夹的内容

这是一个新的 Linux 用户最先学会的几个命令之一。这个命令可以让你看到当前文件夹里有哪些文件和文件夹。

ls


你可以使用长列表选项 ls -l 来查看细节，如文件大小、权限、修改时间等。如果你想，你可以对这些选项进行排序和控制。

ls -l

ls 命令示例


2、cd 命令：改变目录

默认情况下，你从你的主目录下开始。你经常需要改变目录并移动到…]]></summary>

每年 1200 美元的订阅费，可以将发动机的输出功率提高 20-24%，增加扭矩，以及在动态驾驶模式下将百公里加速时间缩短近 1 秒来提高性能。这项服务并不附带任何物理硬件的升级，相反，只需要解锁就可以使用。这个功能提供在奔驰的两款电动汽车上。


消息来源：The Verge



老王点评：订阅制汽车，以后或许生活中所有主要家电都要付费使用，像付电费一样。




攻击者利用数十年前的软件入侵电网

微软警告说，恶意黑客正在利用常见的物联网设备中发现的一个已停用的 Boa Web 服务器来攻击能源领域。在 Boa Web 服务器中发现了一个易受攻击的开源组件，尽管该软件于 2005 年退役，但仍被广泛用于一系列路由器和安全摄像头，以及流行的软件开发工具包。微软表示，在一周的时间里，它已经在全球范围内发现了 100 万个暴露在互联网上的 Boa 服务器组件。

老王点评：遗留的旧软件带来的问题，对无法更新的 IoT 设备是巨大的隐患，这都是历史欠账。




旧金山警方申请部署武装机器人

旧金山警察局目前正在向该市监事会提出申请，要求允许部署机器人来杀死执法部门认为有足够威胁的嫌疑人。警方称，“可能会出现部署致命武力是唯一选择的情况”。这项提案已经遭到了监事会内外的巨大反对。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[微软计划在2023年2月将旗下Internet Explorer 11（简称IE11）网络浏览器在某些Windows系统中禁用。微软计划通过2023年2月累积安全更新在Windows 10系统上永久禁用IE11，这样以后就不能再重新激活和使用了。


目前除了Windows10，IE11也可以在早期版本的Windows上使用，但Windows 7 ESU和Windows 8.1扩展系统最终将在2023年1月结束支持。在停止支持它们后，微软将集中精力处理Windows 10系统相关事宜。


微软已经在网站和Microsoft365管理中心确认了该决定。


“作为计划于2023年2月14日发布的2023年2月Windows安全更新(“B”)的一部分，某些版本的Windows 10将永久禁用已停用的、不支持的Internet Explorer 11(IE11)桌面应用程序。强烈建议在此日期之前在Microsoft Edge中设置IE模式并禁用IE11，以确保你的组织不会遇到业务中断。”


据微软称，以后任何对IE11的调用都将自动重定向到Microsoft Edge网页浏览器。


IT之家获悉，IE11的支持在2022年6月15日结束，第一阶段的退役开始。在该阶段，IE11仍然保留在系统上，但对IE的调用被重定向到Microsoft Edge。第二阶段将从系统中卸载IE11的组件，但微软直到现在也没有提供截止日期。


微软计划在2023年1月17日为Windows 10和Windows 11发布可选更新；该可选的非安全更新将从Windows设备上删除安装的IE11。然后，在2023年2月14日，IE浏览器将作为2月补丁日的一部分被自动删除。可选的更新会提前删除组件，但补丁日的更新将在所有支持的系统上删除。


微软在Microsoft Edge中创建了IE模式，为组织和家庭用户提供了加载需要Internet Explorer技术内容的选项。特别是组织可能操作需要某些Internet Explorer技术的内容。Edge中的IE模式就是为了加载这些内容而设计的。


删除IE11不会从Windows系统中删除该浏览器的所有组件。虽然它不能再运行，但IE的一些组件可能仍然被操作系统上的程序所需要。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Audacity 是一个自由开源的跨平台 音频编辑器。专业人士使用它是因为它提供的功能仅需安装很小的软件包。

你不必成为一名专业人士并使用它的所有功能。你可以使用它从麦克风录制音频，并执行一些基本操作，如背景噪声消除。

我将在本教程中向你展示如何做到这一点。

在 Linux 上安装 Audacity

在 Linux 上安装 Audacity 是一个非常简单的过程。由于其受欢迎，可以在大多数 Linux 发行版的官方存储库中找到它。

你可以在发行版的软件中心或软件包管理器中搜索它。

作为一个终端爱好者，让我分享一下常见发行版的命令。

对于基于 Debian 或 Ubuntu 的发行版：

sudo apt install audacity


对于基于 RHEL 或 Fedora 的发行版：

sudo dnf install audacity


如果你在用基于 Arch 的发行版：

sudo pacman -Syu audacity


注意，通过官方存储库安装可能无法获得 最新版本。要获得最新版本，你可以使用 AppImage 或 Flatpak/Snap 软件包。

使用 Audacity 录制音频

安装 Audacity 后，从应用程序菜单打开它或从终端启动它。你会看到这样的界面：



单击“录制”按钮（红点）即可轻松开始录制。完成后，单击“ 停止”按钮（方形图标）来结束录制。你还可以预览录制的波形，如下所示：



然后，你可以通过单击“播放”按钮（绿色图标）检查录制的内容。

如果你没有看到任何波形，则表示未录制到任何内容。很可能，你没有正确设置音频输入。确保你选择了正确的麦克风，并确保在“系统设置system settings”中其未被静音。你也可以通过 Audacity 接口设置。

录音不会自动保存为 MP3 或其他格式。要保存录音，你可以转到 “文件File → 导出Export” 并选择 “导出为 MP3Export as MP3”（或任何其他想要的格式）。

使用 Audacity 降低背景噪声

Audacity 还有另一个很棒的功能，你可以使用它来减少录制音频中的白噪声。

最好的做法是在开始使用 Audacity 录制时的前五秒不要说任何话。这将为你提供所需的背景噪声。

在录制音频的波形上，选择你认为是背景噪声的部分。



选择噪声部分后，从顶部文件菜单中转到 “效果Effects → 降低噪音Noise Reduction”。

它会像这样打开一个弹出窗口。单击此处的 “获取噪音配置文件Get Noise Profile”。



现在，你已经设置了噪声配置文件。现在，你必须使用它来减少录音中的噪声。

按 Ctrl + A 快捷键选择整段录音。你也可以选择其中的一部分，仅对所选部分减少噪声。

选择音轨后，再次转到 “效果Effects → 降低噪音Noise Reduction”。

这次不要单击 “获取噪音配置文件Get Noise Profile”。这一次，你应该能够按下 “OK” 按钮。

只需按下 “OK” 按钮，即可将降噪效果应用到录音中，并反映在波形上，如下所示：



现在，相较而言，录制的音频将具有更少的噪声。你可以在选择 “降低噪音Noise Reduction” 效果时微调噪声过滤。

总结如下：


选择噪声部分，转到 “效果Effects → 降低噪音Noise Reduction”，然后单击 “获取噪音配置文件Get Noise Profile”

按 Ctrl + A 选择整段音频录制，转到 “效果Effects → 降低噪音Noise Reduction”，这次按 OK 按钮


请注意，你无法移除所有类型的噪声，但这应该会有所帮助。

Audacity 能做更多事情

使用 Audacity 录制音频可能不像使用 GNOME 录音机那样简单，但它并不太复杂。如果你正在录制画外音，降噪功能将非常有用。

Audacity 有更多其他功能，不可能在一个教程中涵盖所有这些功能。这就是为什么我会保持简短的原因。

如果你不能接受 2021 年的 Audacity 的隐私政策调整，试试其他可用的工具。

我希望这个小教程能帮助你使用 Audacity 进行音频录制。如果你有问题或建议，请告诉我。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[以下是如何在 Ubuntu 和其他 Linux 发行版中安装 LibreOffice Base 数据库模块。


流行的自由开源的办公套件 LibreOffice 由六个独立的组件组成。然而，Ubuntu 和相关发行版中默认安装的 LibreOffice 只包括其中的五个：


Calc

Writer

Impress

Draw

Math


由于某些原因，数据库模块 LibreOffice Base 没有被包括在内。所以，这里告诉你如何在 Ubuntu 和其他发行版中单独安装它。

在 Ubuntu 和其他 Linux 中安装 LibreOffice Base

你可以使用 “软件Software” 应用或终端来安装 libreoffic-base 包。我建议使用终端来安装它。打开一个终端窗口，运行以下命令来安装它。

sudo apt install libreoffice-base


如果你喜欢 “软件Software” 应用 或其他基于 GUI 的安装程序，搜索 “libreoffic-base” 并点击安装。

对于 Fedora 和基于 RPM 的发行版，使用以下命令：

sudo dnf install libreoffice-base


如果你在 Arch Linux 中安装了 LibreOffice，无论是 libreoffic-fresh 还是 libreoffic-still，那么就不需要任何操作了。LibreOffice Base 已经包含在这两个软件包中了。你可以开始使用了。

在另一个方面，如果你想看看如何安装最新的 LibreOffice，请查看 这个指南。



最后，安装完毕后，你可以在应用菜单中找出 LibreOffice Base。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Been wondering for a while, if I would have any problems with daily tasks, although, I have always liked using Linux. It's been 2 days since the install and all work/study related tasks are actually easier to do for now, considering the fact that I am running the web app when I have to use Microsoft Word. What do you guys think about Ubuntu?
 I have been thinking about Fedora as well. Seems like it's worth it to try it out. Would appreciate it, if you guys drop some comparison topics in the comments.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I presume that the Linux kernel has some automated testing in place. I am curious to know the logistics behind testing that requires a specific hardware. For example, a hardware driver for a specific printer (or anything, really). 
 Does Linux kernel have a distributed approach to testing, where people that own specific hardware test each pre-release on their hardware (I assume that would be really unlikely)? Do they do mock testing? I am thinking of the scale of the kernel and the number of hardware supported out-of-the-box, and how easily it would be for things to go wrong with a bad change, so I imagine that testing is really important.
 I am thinking more of changes to the kernel core that could break modules than changes to modules. I imagine when changes to modules are made for specific hardware, the contributor has responsibility to at least test before they submit their patch.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I took a minute (a few hours) to prepare a PPA for some deb packages I have been building for awhile, and let me tell you, there are about a billion ways that can break that I don't want to support. Let's put it this way -- it wasn't exactly fun. There were a few missteps. And I'm not certain I won't break it on the next update. Updating automatically is a chore, and isn't done yet, because I don't understand GitHub Actions.
 After all this I thought, why doesn't someone do this for me? After all my software works for me. I mean -- deb packages are great, but I don't really need a deb package built for me, and a PPA to deliver it to my door. This is mostly something I'm doing to help someone else.
 And my goodness how much digital ink has been spilled in r/linux and r/ubuntu regarding how much people hate Snaps. Given the grassroots support, you'd think there would be a group of folks just constantly building native Linux deb packages for other folks because of how easy it is (for them, not for me obviously). A concierge service if you will. 
 Wait a minute! Why isn't there a group that does nothing but build and distribute all native Linux packages? Because I want to support the entire archipelago of Linux systems for goodness sakes! If it's so easy (for them obviously, not me) to turn around a package and a repo, if thats what the Linux Desktop Users are demanding, why is this not a thing?! Obviously, it's super important. They talk about it all the time. And these people that talk and talk would be lining up to do something about the scourge of non-native packages.
 So I think this is (finally) one of those bright ideas and I wanted to share it with you. I think I am ready for someone else to literally build me a world without Snaps/Flatpak/AppImage.

 I have been working on creating my own KDE based Alpine Desktop, originally intended for use on my laptop, but possibly now as a persistent USB... It's been a journey - but I think it's going to be worth it in the long run. 
 I would like to know what others think about using Alpine as a daily desktop - I know it's not what the OS is developed or intended for, but I've always felt that it could be made into a good lightweight alternative to the available linux desktops. 
 Anyone else using Alpine as a desktop?
 Any thoughts on it? Would this seem like a pipe dream or a worthwhile endeavor?
 Thanks. 😊🙃

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey everyone!
In the last months I've been working on Unclutter, a modern reader mode browser extension. In contrast to all existing approaches, it unclutters articles by modifying their CSS instead of extracting the text content.
This results in a more visually pleasing result that reuses the original article style. The idea is to remove friction so you use the reader mode more often.
There are a few more features around saving articles automatically and taking highlights -- more details are on the website.
The extension has about 400 active weekly users right now, mostly from organic web store traffic. Monetisation has proven to be hard and for freemium there would need to be much higher numbers anyways.
Do you think I should keep working on the project?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[据华尔街日报中文网援引The Information报道称，Alphabet旗下的谷歌正在考虑裁员1万人，占其全球员工总数的6%。


报道指出，此举将基于一个排名系统，该系统将淘汰排名最低的“表现不佳”的员工。


报道还称，谷歌发言人在一份声明中表示，“今年早些时候，我们推出了谷歌评估和发展系统，以帮助员工获得全年的发展、辅导、学习和职业进步。这一新系统有助于建立明确的期望，并为员工提供定期反馈。”


另据美国消费者新闻与商业频道(CNBC)报道称，谷歌公司内部的焦虑情绪正在上升。


上述报道提到，谷歌的业务受到的打击并不像许多同行那样严重，但潜在的衰退、通胀飙升和利率上升的综合影响正在产生明显的影响。


此外，Alphabet的高管们近期还强调，公司需要更专注，降低各种项目的成本，并使公司的效率提高20%。其首席执行官皮查伊曾表示，“显而易见的是，我们正面临着一个具有挑战性的宏观环境，未来将有更多的不确定性。”


Alphabet的净利也在下降。三季报显示，其第三季营收为690.9亿美元，低于市场预期的705.8亿美元，去年同期为651.2亿美元；净利润从去年同期的189.4亿美元大幅下滑至139.1亿美元。


近期，包括Meta、推特、亚马逊、Carvana、思科、Lyft和Stripe在内的科技公司都陷入了裁员风波，这影响了全球数以万计的工作岗位。


对此，华尔街日报分析指出，疫情开始后，随着用户的消费行为都转向线上，科技公司的收入和员工人数出现了爆发式增长。但如今，疫情红利逐渐消退，科技巨头们不得不裁减数以千计的员工。

我经常使用程序坞。在本文中，我将分享一些关于有效使用程序坞的小技巧，并介绍自定义程序坞的外观和位置的方法。

你将在本教程中学习到以下内容：


程序坞的基本用途：添加应用程序，并使用快捷方式来启动应用程序

自定义程序坞的外观：更改图标大小、图标位置

更改程序坞的位置：可用于单屏和多显示器的设置

在程序坞中隐藏已安装的磁盘图标

自动隐藏或禁用程序坞

使用 dconf-editor 对程序坞进行额外的定制

用其他程序坞应用程序替换 Ubuntu 默认的程序坞


我将在教程中使用 程序坞dock、面板panel和 启动器launcher 等术语，它们的意思是等同的。

如何使用 Ubuntu 程序坞：你必须知道的基础知识

如果你是 Ubuntu 的新手，你需要掌握如何使用程序坞。尽管，在一段时间后你总会熟悉程序坞的功能，但是阅读本文能让你更快地明白。

向程序坞添加新的应用程序（或删除应用程序）

这一步骤十分简单。从菜单中搜索你想要添加在程序坞的应用程序，然后运行它。

正在运行的应用程序会显示在程序坞中，它的图标在程序坞中所有图标的下方。右键单击该图标，然后选择 “添加到收藏夹Add to Favorites” 选项。这会把该应用程序的图标锁定到程序坞上。



从程序坞中删除应用程序的图标，操作起来更为简单。你不需要运行你想要在程序坞删除的应用程序，只需右键单击应用程序图标，然后选择 “从收藏夹中删除Remove From Favorites” 即可。



更改程序坞中的图标顺序

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[以下是你如何在 Debian、Ubuntu 和其他发行版中修复 “sudo command not found” 错误的方法。


有时，当你第一次设置或安装 Linux 发行版 时，你在用 sudo 尝试一些命令时，会出现 “sudo command not found” 的错误。

sudo 命令是 “superuser do” 的缩写，它是一个允许用户以管理员权限执行命令的程序。sudo 命令帮助你像管理员用户一样运行程序/命令。

此外，用 sudo 运行命令的用户必须是 sudo 组的一部分。

你看到这个错误的主要原因是该软件包本身没有安装。然而，大多数现代 Linux 发行版都默认提供了这个功能，但有些则没有。

下面是解决这个问题需要遵循的步骤。

故障排除 #1

首先，安装 sudo 包来解决这个问题。打开一个终端，刷新你的系统，并运行以下命令来安装 sudo。

对于 Ubuntu、Debian 和相关发行版：

su -apt updateapt install sudo


对于 Arch Linux：

pacman -S sudo


对于 Fedora、RHEL 等：

su -dnf updatednf install sudo


上述安装完成后，你必须使用以下命令将用户添加到 sudo 组中。

usermod -aG sudo <yourusername>


然后从终端运行 visudo，并运行以下行。按 CTRL+O 和 CTRL+X 来保存和退出。



退出并再次登录使变化生效。

故障排除 #2

在做了上述改变之后，如果你仍然收到错误信息，那么请按照以下步骤操作。

确保你的 $PATH 变量包含 sudo 可执行文件的正确路径。如果 sudo 已经安装，但 $PATH 不正确，你也会得到这个错误。理想情况下，你的路径应该包含以下所有的路径。

echo $PATH


/usr/local/bin:/usr/local/sbin:/usr/bin:/usr/sbin


要改变路径变量，使用以下命令。例如，如果 /usr/bin 不存在，那么你可以通过以下方式添加它。

export PATH=$PATH:/usr/bin


然后注销并登录查看效果。

总结

我希望这个指南能帮助你解决 Linux 发行版中的 sudo 错误。表面上的解决方案很简单，真的。

如果有帮助，或者如果你有任何问题，请在下面留言。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Just started using mpv and am impressed with the featureset and overall quality of the app. It's really quite good!
 ​
 Wanted to highlight something I really appreciated and don't see lots of other projects do: their keybindings example file!
 You can find the keybindings here: https://github.com/mpv-player/mpv/blob/master/etc/input.conf
 Snippet:
 ## Seek units are in seconds, but note that these are limited by keyframes #RIGHT seek 5 # seek 5 seconds forward #LEFT seek -5 # seek 5 seconds backward #UP seek 60 # seek 1 minute forward #DOWN seek -60 # seek 1 minute backward 
 This is exactly what I want out of apps in terms of keybindings documentation! They make the format obvious, there's a helpful inline comment, I'm not left guessing where I can find a list of functions to bind to. Really good! I hope more open source projects follow their example, I think one of the biggest pain points with new users is navigating sorta arcane config/bindings files.

 Any recommended book(s) to learn in-depth knowledge about the Kernel?
 I somehow finished undergrad without taking an OS course. (because of scheduling issues. trust me I wanted to take an OS class)
 Lately I've been trying to learn about how Docker works under the hood, and I'm grasping some of the concepts. But I need a book. I prefer reading literal paper pages over the endless CLI man pages.

In short its an IDE (VSCode/JetBrains) plugin that lets you share blocks of code that link directly to the code inside your IDE or repo. We use it all the time and think its pretty nifty tech that lets you understand someone’s code in context very quickly.  we’re hoping to keep refining it to make it better and more useful.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[For those who are waiting for Linux on Apple hardware, the Asahi Linux
project has put out a detailed
report on progress toward a working kernel and distribution.


	This kind of safety model is not new: it is already commonplace on
	Android phones, where it is usually implemented in DSP
	firmware. But of course, the desktop Linux ecosystem doesn’t even
	have a speaker EQ database framework yet, nevermind safety models!
	The eternal lagging behind of Linux audio strikes again. What’s the
	plan? While this isn’t settled yet, our current idea is to
	implement the safety model in a stand-alone daemon that captures
	the voltage/current feedback data from the ALSA device, and drives
	the mixer volume itself as as means of implementing soft power
	limits, together with some kind of “safety watchdog interlock” with
	the kernel that only enables higher volume limits when the daemon
	is active and running]]></summary>

刘强东在邮件中表示，京东今天所有成功都离不开兄弟们的努力和坚持，在成功合并德邦之后，京东体系的员工总数已经突破了54万，相信未来京东可以为国家和社会直接带来超过100万就业岗位。


“德邦现有的员工，不管是外包还是自有的，都是我们的兄弟，自2023年1月1日起，逐步为十几万德邦的兄弟们缴齐五险一金，确保每个德邦兄弟都能‘老有所养，病有所医’，为兄弟们提供基础保障。过去，德邦的做法虽然合规合法，而且缴纳的五险一金比例远远超过其它同类公司，但依然有很多外包兄弟不能像自有员工一样享受全额五险一金待遇。我们会按照一定条件，逐步把外包兄弟转化为德邦自己的员工！让大家更有保障！”刘强东在信中表示。


目前，京东是行业内唯一一家与物流一线员工签订正式劳动合同并缴纳“五险一金”的公司，根据公开数据测算，2022年前三个季度，京东为一线员工的薪酬福利支出已超过330亿元。


“集团拿出100亿元人民币，为包括全体德邦兄弟们在内的所有集团基层员工设立‘住房保障基金’，我希望此举能为工作满五年以上全体员工，包括每一个快递兄弟和客服兄弟实现购房愿望。这是循环无息贷款基金，意味着未来十年，集团累积投入资金总额高达数百亿人民币。”刘强东在信中表示。


京东从自建物流之初就采用全职员工，与一线快递员签署劳动合同、缴纳五险一金，提供商业保险、通讯、防寒防暑、交通工具等多种福利及补贴。除了高于同行业平均水平的薪酬福利待遇之外，京东早在2012年就开始打造“安居计划”，向符合条件的员工提供最高100万的无抵押、无担保、无利息的资金支持，用于…]]></summary>

 Now my question to you:
 Did anyone recently compare power consumption of proprietary nvidia driver, open nvidia driver and nouveau in a similar way?
 Thanks!

今年夏天，Ubuntu 为赛昉科技的昉・星光 RISC-V 单板计算机发布了官方镜像，而现在正在为即将发布的昉・星光 2 准备新的镜像。昉・星光 2 在几个月前宣布，将在年底陆续发货。它使用 SiFive 的 U74 四核 RISC-V SoC，运行频率高达 1.5GHz，有 2GB 到 8GB 的内存，双千兆以太网。除了 Ubuntu，他们还在努力支持多个 Linux 发行版。

老王点评：新的板子更强大，价格也不贵，我觉得树莓派并不一定是最好的选择了。




英伟达称融化的 RTX 4090 是因为电源线没插好

在英伟达宣布它正在调查关于其 RTX 4090 显卡的电源线融化和燃烧的报告数周后，他们认为大多是因为电源线没插好而导致急剧发热。4090 使用了使用新标准的电源连接器，因而需要专门的适配器。调查显示，这个适配器在设计上缺乏正确插入指示，因此没有完全插好的电源线会急剧发热，从而融毁电源线和 GPU 等设备。


消息来源：The Verge



老王点评：虽然可能是用户没插好，但是其实归根到底是产品设计不够好。




高性能计算越来越多采用液冷

随着 400W 的 CPU 和 700W 的 GPU 的出现，对这些部件的冷却已经不能风扇所能满足的了。本周在达拉斯举行的超级计算会议上，展示了一些冷却设备，其中将冷板连接到 CPU、GPU 上的直接式液冷可以散掉 80%-90% 的热量；也有一些采用浸入式液冷，整个设备浸入在冷却液中或在密闭的机箱中注满冷却液。报告称，预计到 2026 年，液体和浸入式冷却设备的支出将达到 11 亿美元，占热管理支出的 19%。


消息来源：The Register



老王点评：只能说现在的计算设备越来越热了。]]></summary>

https://blog.pimaker.at/texts/rvc1/ Risc V emulator in a shader
https://github.com/SCRN-VRC/SVM-Face-and-Object-Detection-Shader Object detection in a shader

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Kubernetes 的优势不仅在于它能够做什么，还在于知道它能为你做什么。




在 树莓派家庭实验室上运行 Kubernetes 的 5 个理由 这篇文章中，我解释了为什么推荐在家里使用 Kubernetes。其中的理由相对来说会有点随意，并且主要于关注结果。除了 Kubernetes 好用的功能之外，还有其他几个应将 Kubernetes 包含在你自己的计算机的理由。

（LCTT 译注：家庭实验室Homelab 指的是安置在你家里的一个服务器或者多服务器的组合配置。在之上托管了多个服务和虚拟系统，以此来进行测试、开发，或者提供家庭功能用途。）

1、Kubernetes 是基于 Linux 而建立的



Kubernetes 有很高的知名度。对于一些人来说，Kubernetes 是一种神秘技术，有一个不好念的名字；而对另一些人来说，Kubernetes 就好像是牧羊犬放牧羊群一样，可以帮助他们管理过多的容器；对于其它人来说，Kubernetes 是一种 云cloud 的操作系统，是 实效云开发effective cloud development 的一个有用的界面；对于大多数人来说，Kubernetes 可能是他们从未听说过的后端软件。正如人们所想的那样，Kubernetes 具有所有这些能力，甚至有更多的功能。

并非每个人都以相同的方式使用 Kubernetes，但如果你主要的工作是系统管理，你会发现 Kubernetes 只是又一个 Linux 命令。

我有一件 T 恤，上面写着 “容器就是 LinuxContainers are Linux”，它的意思是显而易见的。容器技术使用 cgroup，来运行包含一个或一组应用程序的最小 Linux 操作系统镜像。当你运行容器时，实际上你就是在运行 Linux。虽然 Kubernetes 能在许…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[在 Ubuntu 和其他 Linux 中安装最新的 LibreOffice 版本的快速指南。


自由开源的办公套件 LibreOffice 有两个版本：社区版和企业版。“社区” 版是为那些希望获得最新的尖端软件技术的早期采用者准备的。而 “企业” 版本更加稳定，可能不包括所有的最新功能，但它是生产环境和专业工作的理想选择。

在 Ubuntu 和其他 Linux 中安装最新的 LibreOffice

1、删除预安装的 LibreOffice

Ubuntu 和其他的 Linux 发行版带有预安装的 LibreOffice。这可能不是最新的，这是因为发行版有特定的发行周期。在进行新安装之前，你可以通过以下命令删除 Ubuntu 及其衍生发行版中的的旧版本。

打开一个终端并运行以下命令，以删除 Ubuntu 和相关发行版中的已安装的 LibreOffice。对于其他发行版，你可以使用发行版的软件包管理器将其删除。

sudo apt remove –purge libreoffice*
sudo apt autoclean
sudo apt autoremove


然后重启以确保一切正常（尽管你也可以跳过这一步）。

2、从网站上下载安装

前往 官方下载页面. 并通过从下拉菜单中选择类型下载 “最新的” 版本。对于 Ubuntu 和其他衍生产品，请选择 .deb 文件。



下载后，提取文件；你应该看到下面的所有软件包。



在提取文件的位置打开终端，并按顺序运行以下命令。首先，你需要安装 ure 包，其次是核心包，然后是所有的基本包。最后，就是主要的 LibreOffice 软件包。下面是一组典型的命令。你需要更改为具体版本的版本号。

sudo dpkg -i libobasis7.0-ure_7.0.4.2-2_amd64.deb
sudo dpkg -i libobasis7.0-core_7.0.4.2-2_amd64.deb
sudo dpkg -i libobasis7.0*


sudo dpkg -i libreoffice7.0*


如果你使用的是 Fedora Linux 或 Red Hat Linux，请按照上述相同的顺序使用 dnf 命令。



等待安装完成。完成后，你可以通过应用程序菜单找到 LibreOffice。



这应该完成安装最新 LibreOffice 的步骤。如果你不想遵循上述方法，请参阅以下选项。

通过 PPA 安装

如果你想通过 PPA 安装它，请按照以下步骤操作。确保在上面的第 1 步中删除现有的 LibreOffice。

sudo add-apt-repository ppa:libreoffice/ppa


最后，运行以下命令从这个官方 PPA 安装最新的 LibreOffice 5.4 系列。

sudo apt update
sudo apt install libreoffice


安装后，你可以通过 Dash 搜索启动 LibreOffice。



通过 Snap 和 Flatpak 安装

如果你是 Linux 用户，你可以尝试 LibreOffice 独立的可执行文件，它在 Snap 或 Flatpak 等沙箱中运行。

要通过 Flatpak 安装 LibreOffice ，请访问 这个页面 进行设置，然后运行以下命令进行安装：

flatpak install flathub org.libreoffice.LibreOffice


同样，对于 Snap 版本，使用以下命令进行安装：

sudo snap install libreoffice


如何升级到最新的 LibreOffice 版本？

如果你不想删除 LibreOffice 但想升级到最新版本，请阅读我们下面的完整指南。


在 Ubuntu、Linux Mint 和 Windows 中升级到最新的 LibreOffice


如果你在安装最新的 LibreOffice 时遇到问题，请随时留言。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[前言：先对广东潮州发生的2死多伤智能汽车失控事故致以默哀10分钟。


为啥写这篇文章，是因为看了很多网络评论的分析，都仅仅停留在刹车是否踩下等的初浅问题的讨论上。


作为某“大型”南极动物的工厂出来的前“某天网”安全架构师和项目主导人，我觉得有必要通过在网络安全角度，深入分析一下导致事故的各种因素，从而得出有利于对公众安全、长期认真真正负责任的分析。


首先我们知道，复杂系统一定是不可靠的，不管是谁做的。


这里先拿曾经的高铁动车事故来说：复杂的电信号和网络系统，总会因为人为的非人为的原因，导致系统层面的失控或者事故发生。


简单来说：对于安全而言，所有系统都有漏洞。  专业点来说：图灵完备的软件系统无法证明绝对正确。而智能汽车、智能电气系统，一定是有图灵完备的软件系统的：包含了spaceX这样的宇航员用的智能系统——曾经就发生过因为一个计算符号写少了等于号，所以价值几十亿美金的航天飞机失事，7个宇航员殉职。对没错，发生在美国。


温州动车事故发生后，作为没拿上岗许可证的程序员，内心很是惶恐。据说原因是某些没拿证的程序员开发的系统有BUG（程序错误）导致的信号系统失控。


当然，现在不用什么据说不据说，据说一般都是“谣言”。这里想说的是在各种事故发生了，总会有各种言论出来做为分析，不一定正确，但代表了某些人的看法。


某B音的飞机因传感器问题导致的软件系统失控，这里飞机驾驶员的权限还不如软件系统。然后大家都知道了，死了不少人，某型号的飞机也被禁飞了很久。


所以，我觉得：如果软件很重要，为什么不更注意安全多一些。在网络安全、软件安全、系统安全上投入多一些，总会带来更多的可靠性和品牌赞誉。


举了这么多例子，说了这么多事故的故事。那么我们如何来分析这次智能汽车导致的事故的原因呢？


智能系统一定是复杂系统，甚至…]]></summary>

一家初创公司借助 DALL-E 的 API 创建生成性的幻灯片（PPT），其产品旨在让用户在几分钟内，而不是几小时内创建幻灯片。他们发现，对于他们的大多数用户来说，“在几次尝试中可以得到一些有助于实现其观点的东西。”并且，他们还计划利用 GPT-3 对文件进行总结，添加到幻灯片中。


消息来源：Venture Beat



老王点评：这倒是一个好的应用，以后做 PPT 不用那么费劲就可以做出来了。




AI 辅助编程公司 Kite 关闭和宣布开源

成立于 2014 年的 AI 辅助编程公司 Kite 比 GitHub Copilot 起步更早，但很遗憾的是未能建立起一个盈利机制。Kite 虽然有 50 万月活跃开发者用户，但他们的支付意愿很低，仅仅提高程序员的编程速度 18% 并不能说服工程经理们掏钱。Kite 宣布停止运作，公开大部分源代码，项目托管在 GitHub 上。


消息来源：Kite



老王点评：看来 AI 替代人类进行编程，还有比较长的道路。




安全专家两年间秘密帮助解密勒索软件

安全研究人员在 Zeppelin 勒索软件的加密机制中发现了漏洞，并利用这些漏洞创建了一个工作的解密器，他们自 2020 年以来用于帮助受害公司恢复文件而不向攻击者付款。原本他们在 2020 年 2 月已经准备好了一份技术报告，但推迟了发布，以避免勒索黑帮知道，并悄悄帮助被勒索的机构恢复数据。可能是察觉了这种帮助解密的情况，现在 Zeppelin 采取了多次加密的方式来勒索赎金。


消息来源：Bleeping Computer



老王点评：说到底，勒索软件也是存在 bug 的，这就是和安全专家的博弈。]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[我们点评了为程序员和开发人员提供的十大最佳 Linux 发行版（2022 版），以帮助他们完成工作和个人项目。


程序员和开发人员在其工作或项目中会使用各种工具和应用程序，包括代码编辑器、编程语言编译器、附加组件、数据库等。如果你对现代开发者的工作流程进行分类，它包含以下典型的工作流程：


访问代码库

编程

调试

测试

部署


而这种典型的工作流程可能需要各种工具。一个标准的清单可能是这样的：


代码编辑器

简单的文本编辑器

网页浏览器（网页开发者需要所有变体）

数据库引擎

一个本地服务器

编程语言相应的编译器

调试器

监测或剖析工具（可执行文件或网络版）


可以说，与 Windows 相比，Linux 是编程的最佳选择。（出于几个原因，我在本文中不对 macOS 进行比较。）Linux 是最佳选择的主要原因是，与 Windows 相比，在 Linux 发行版中已经预装具有现代技术的软件包和应用程序，或非常容易安装。

因此，在这篇文章中，我们想列出 2022 年最适合程序员的 Linux 发行版。

2022 年适合程序员的十大 Linux 发行版

1、Fedora Workstation



也许这个名单中最完美的 Linux 发行版是 Fedora Linux。它用于桌面的默认 Workstation 版通过其选择的软件包带来了正宗的 GNOME 桌面体验。

Fedora Linux 的默认安装为你提供了所有主要的开发包，开箱即用。它们包括 PHP、OpenJDK、PostgreSQL、Django、Ruby on Rails、Ansible 等。

通过 dnf 软件包管理器安装更多的应用程序是非常简单的，如 VS Code 编辑器和其他软件包。你也可以借助“软件Softw…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Void is an independent binary distro created in 2008. Installed from a TUI installer, you assemble the user experience yourself. Void follows a conservative rolling release model and uses Runit instead of SystemD. Software is kept vanilla without Void branding. All the claims to fame are on the website https://voidlinux.org/. The following is why I use void, and why it may be a good option for you to.
 The conservative rolling model keeps behind a little bit, but not by a lot. New bugs introduced in major software versions have time to get squashed before reaching the end user. But you also won't have issues with old software making it a pain to interact with the outside world, and you won't be waiting for an OS release cycle for other bug fixes. You get relatively recent software without …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I tried Wayland before, many times. Nvidia drivers not ready yet, also I noticed some tablet settings are missing, also forced vysnc not a good idea (I know, it's changed recently.). So, can you tell me the status of Wayland in 2022-2023? What features is missing? Any sacrifice of KDE customisations? 
 Edit: Thanks you guys, for all answers. For me multi monitor setup and modern hardware support so crucial. Also I worried about old X apps. I searched technical side of Wayland, my brain is melting- So, I still learning Wayland and compositor side. Missing features will be add in the near future, I'm really happy to Wayland succes. Windows have this same problem, they can't change this stuff, W11 same. I hope Windows side get better and secure one day. :'3

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[以下是你如何在 Debian、Ubuntu 和其他发行版中修复 “bash: wget command not found” 的错误。


著名的 wget 工具被用来通过终端从 URL 下载任何文件。它是 Linux 终端中最流行和最快速的工具之一。

作为一个 GNU 工具，wget 带来了一些奇妙的功能。你可以实现各种目的，如从网上提取信息、下载文件、暂停/恢复等。

然而，许多 Linux 发行版 在默认安装时并没有附带这个工具。因此，当你想用 wget 下载一些文件时，你会得到 wget 命令未找到的错误。

修复它其实很容易。

修复 wget 命令未找到

你所需要做的就是打开终端，运行以下命令来安装 wget。

对于 Ubuntu、Linux Mint、elementaryOS、Debian 和相关发行版：

sudo apt install wget


Arch Linux：

pacman -S wget


对于 Fedora（虽然它默认包括）：

sudo dnf install wget


安装后，你就可以使用 wget 程序了。你也可以通过检查其版本来验证它是否正确安装。

wget --version


如何使用 wget

下面是一些关于如何使用 wget 的例子。

命令的语法如下：

wget [选项]… [URL]…


例如，如果我想下载 Ubuntu 的 ISO 文件，那么我可以运行下面的命令，用 URL 直接下载。

wget https://releases.ubuntu.com/22.04.1/ubuntu-22.04.1-desktop-amd64.iso




同样，你也可以使用上述命令下载，或者，通过下面描述的几个开关组合。你也可以通过 wget --help 命令得到这个：


-t, --tries=NUMBER 设置重试次数为 NUMBER（0 为不限）

--retry-connrefused 即使连接被拒绝，也要重试

--retry-on-http-error=ERRORS 逗号分隔的 HTTP 错误列表，以便重试

-O, --output-document=FILE 将文件写入 FILE 中

--nc, --no-clobber 跳过那些会下载到现有文件的下载（即覆盖它们）

--no-netrc 不要试图从 .netrc 中获取证书

-c, --continue 继续已部分下载的文件

--start-pos=OFFSET 从 OFFSET 位置开始下载

--progress=TYPE 选择进度条类型

--show-progress 在详细模式下显示进度条

--N, --timestamping 不重新获取文件，除非比本地文件新

--no-if-modified-since 在时间戳模式下不使用条件性的 if-modified-since 获取请求的资源

--no-use-server-timestamps 不以服务器上的时间戳来设置本地文件的时间戳

--S, --server-response 打印服务器响应

--spider 不下载任何东西

-T, --timeout=SECONDS 设置所有的超时值为 SECONDS 秒

--dns-timeout=SECS 将 DNS 查询超时设置为 SECS

--connect-timeout=SECS 将连接超时设置为 SECS

--read-timeout=SECS 设置读取超时为 SECS

--w, --wait=SECONDS 在两次检索之间等待 SECONDS 秒（适用于检索的 URL 超过 1个）

--waitretry=SECONDS 在检索的重试之间等待 1 到 SECONDS 秒（适用于检索的 URL 超过 1 个）

--random-wait 在两次检索之间等待 0.5WAIT 到 1.5WAIT 秒（适用于检索的 URL 超过 1 个）


总结

我希望这个指南能帮助你解决 Linux 发行版中的 wget 错误。显然方案是非常简单的。

如果有帮助或者你有任何问题，请在下面留言。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[To all of you experts, kindly state in clear fashion why, if you choose any side of it.
 Let me start with my understanding (please don't fret) 
 I can assure you that git is software that gobbles up more of your time than anything else. But ...but ... It is worth spending time with something, which has an impact on long-term good and boosts efficiency guarantee. All you need is a little bit of patience to brush aside the difficulty it imposes.
 Make no mistake, that this damn thing is pretty hard to get efficient(I know ..I know, masters will say, you miss the point of its efficiency). But, I am looking at it, like an average person uses it and it takes tons of time to get the basics right(like everything else??)..
 If you think, there is a psychological barrier or mental block or grey cells of mine are not good enough to capture the vibe, then I must say, you are not wrong.
 So, flame(not to roast me, but to suggest, it is an old school lingo, pardon me) me with your understanding and, please, wit ,satire and subtility always bypass me somehow.
 Kindly, be to the point.
 Thank you.

 I got tired of Windows and I AM ready to sacrifice Adobe products as well as games for the sake of security,privacy and convenience. 
 If that's all I need to sacrifice, count me in ! 
 I was wondering, before I jump into it, what are main things that every novice should know about and first steps one should take after first install of linux distro ? 
 Oh btw, some dictionary would be awesome to have, like, explaining what distro means, what some commands mean, etc.
 Basically Linux lexicon would be great to have.

 Edit: before starting any war here. I use ubuntu since 2015. I like how gnome looks (I even liked unity). I feel that I am using something different than Windows and Mac. But when I compare it to any other flavor, I feel they are snappier, less machine demanding than gnome.
 I really want to understand.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Once more i tried to switch to Linux, i tried various distros, Debian, Ubuntu, Fedora and most recently Pop-OS.
 I never have issues switching to the new environment, it’s different but nice. Learning the different quirks and oddities is fun and in the end i get everything working well.
 But then comes the issue that gets me every time… audio quality. I am NOT an audiophile, i use normal desk speakers and a very decent headset. In windows i use a soundblaster z, before that i used an x-fi an, audigy 1 and SB Live.
 I realize creative offers no support on linux but the drivers are present in the kernel and audio works without much hassle.
 But everything sounds muffled, dull and too bassy. I tried the integrated sound card, same issue. Tried a USB headset, exactly the same problem. Tried external speakers, different headset it’s all the same.
 I followed tutorials on how to modify resampling, equalizers, switching to pipewire etc… Nothing got me clear sound. Modifying settings via alsamixer , modifying crystalizer etc. Nothing comes close to the audio experience in windows.
 And then came games. I love what valve is doing with proton and i own a steamdeck. On my steamdeck the audio is far better so i know it can be improved. I just do not know where to find what/how they do it.
 Positional audio is almost non existent on any of my linux installs everything gets forced into stereo. Selecting 5.1 always sends audio to the wrong channels. (Center channel to left front for ex.)
 So that is the only thing that keeps me from using linux, the abysmal sound experience breaks my spirit every time.
 Cheers.

 Just to preface this, yes! I have an Nvidia GPU. But guess what? That doesn't change a damn thing about what I'm about to say. First off, My experience, at least when it comes to the graphic stack, took an immense step forward with Wayland. 
 some of the good things I noticed: 
  
My two monitors have mismatched refresh rates and Wayland properly addressed them.
 Screentearing wasn't noticeable, if it even exists
 ...
  
That's it. Everything else is a regression.
 First off, if you're not using Gnome or KDE, you're pretty much a 3rd rate citizen. 
  
Screen sharing doesn't fucking work. Period. I do not consider a screensharing model where you have to share your entire screen or nothing as "working". You can't share individual applications.…]]></summary>

MacOS 包管理器 Homebrew 的创建者新开发了一个名为 Tea 的包管理器，作为 Homebrew 的最终继承者。Tea 除了一些包管理器的新功能之外，还有一种基于区块链的方法，以确保开源软件的创造者、维护者和贡献者都能为他们的努力获得报酬。他从 NFT 中获得了灵感，简单来说，关注开源软件生态健康的人可以购买通证并质押，而 Tea 作为一个 DAO 会奖励质押者和注册的软件包及其依赖关系的贡献者。

协调世界时将停止添加“闰秒”

11 月 18 日，全球代表在计量大会（CGPM）上投票决定，“从 2035 年起，将搁置在官方时钟上增加‘闰秒’以使其与地球自转同步的做法。”这意味着从 2035 年开始，或者可能更早，天文时间（称为 UT1）将被允许与协调世界时（UTC）相差一秒以上，甚至多达一分钟，而协调世界时是以原子钟的稳定滴答为基础。添加闰秒的做法始于 1972 年。


消息来源：《自然杂志》



老王点评：添加闰秒给互联网服务和各种依赖精确计时的服务带来很多麻烦，而且我们可能还面临着史无前例的负闰秒。取消了也好。




GIMP 2.99.14 发布

这是迈向 GIMP 3.0 的最新开发版本，GIMP 3.0 将从 GTK2 切换到 GTK3 工具箱，并有大量仍在开发中的其他改进。此版本的具体改进没有什么太值得说的，在发布公告中说，“从 3.0 的路线图中可以看出，大多数项目都‘接近完成’或‘已经完成’。……真正接近了 GIMP 3.0 的发布。……开始针对具体的痛点，很多痛点。”

 I browsed distrowatch for a distro that I like. There are a lot of distros. 
 I decided to install Ubuntu.
 I love the open source feeling. It has a different feeling than Windows for sure. A lot of things working differently. I love the terminal, but i only can copy and paste commands. I want to learn to use it. The best command i know so far is neofetch. That looks very good! 
 Fortunately most of the sofwares i use are open source, so they are available on Linux too (VLC, Chromium, etc.).
 Thanks for reading my post.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[全球首富、推特新老板马斯克星期天（11月20日）在推特上公布恢复特朗普账号的决定。马斯克写道：“民众已经决定。将恢复特朗普（的账号）。人民之声，就是上帝之声。”


综合彭博社和路透社报道，马斯克星期五（18日）在推特展开24小时民调，询问网民是否应该恢复特朗普的账号，共收到超过1500万张票，赞同者以51.8%胜出。


就允许特朗普重返推特的决定，马斯克用拉丁语短语写道：“民之声，神之声（Vox Populi, Vox Dei）”。在2021年1月6日美国国会山骚乱事件发生后，推特在其联合创始人兼时任CEO多尔西（Jack Dorsey）的领导下“永久封禁”了特朗普的8800万推特粉丝的推特账号。


据《华盛顿邮报》报导，特朗普周六在线上参加活动时谈到了马斯克发起的民意调查和他的推特账户主题。特朗普对重返推特平台的前景反应冷淡，重申了之前的言论，即他宁愿将注意力集中在他的克隆网站“Truth Social”上。


特朗普在谈到重返推特时说：“我看不出有什么理由，对于很多人来说Truth Social已经取代了（推特）的位置，我不认为他们会回到推特上”。虽然特朗普借机宣传自己的社交媒体平台，但他说自己很欣赏这次投票，并欢迎马斯克对推特的收购。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Fedora Workstation 37 是 Fedora Project 桌面操作系统的最新版本，由致力于推动开源创新的全球社区开发。本文介绍了 Fedora Workstation 37 中一些面向用户的新功能。现在就从 GNOME “软件Software”应用升级，或者在你最喜欢的终端模拟器中使用 dnf system-upgrade 升级！

GNOME 43

Fedora Workstation 37 具有最新版本的 GNOME 桌面环境，其中包含更多移植到 GTK 4 的核心应用、用户界面调整和性能调整。查看 GNOME 43 发行说明 了解更多信息！

重新设计的快速设置菜单



新的“快速设置Quick Settings”菜单提供更多控制和便利。你现在可以在菜单中轻松切换你的 Wi-Fi 网络，而不用进入全屏对话框；在默认模式和深色模式之间切换；以及在不打开“设置Settings”应用的情况下启用夜灯。现在还提供了一个方便的截屏和录屏按钮。

核心应用

Fedora Workstation 37 中包含的 GNOME 核心应用已经进行了一轮调整和改进：


“文件Files”应用已移植到 GTK 4，并且用户界面有许多改进。这里只是其中的一些：

它现在是自适应的，这意味着它会自动调整到更窄的尺寸，从而更好地利用可用空间。

列表视图已重新设计，使橡皮筋选择更容易。

重新设计了 “属性Properties” 和 “打开方式……Open With…” 对话框。 




“日历Calendar”应用有一个新的边栏，可以一目了然地显示即将发生的事件。它与“联系人Contacts”应用一起，现在具有自适应用户界面。

“角色Characters”应用现在会向你显示不同的肤色、头发颜色和表情符号的性别选项。

“软件Software” 中的包源选择器已重新设计并移至更显眼的位置。

“地图Maps”应用已移植到 GTK 4。

“设置Settings”应用包括一个新的“设备安全Device Security”面板，让你可以轻松查看你的设备提供或缺少的硬件安全功能！ 


新补充的默认壁纸

Fedora Workstation 37 附带一组新的补充壁纸。 在这里看看它们是如何制作的！



Fedora Linux 37 的底层变化

Fedora Linux 37 具有许多底层更改。以下是一些值得注意的：


现已正式支持树莓派 4 单板机，包括 3D 加速！

在 BIOS 系统上的新安装将使用 GPT 磁盘布局，而不是传统的 MBR 布局。在 BIOS 系统上，安装程序镜像现在还将使用 GRUB 而不是 syslinux 进行引导。

如果你禁用然后重新启用 SELinux，或运行 fixfiles onboot 命令，文件系统的重新标记过程现在将并行完成，从而显着提高速度。

波斯语的默认字体已从 DejaVu 和 Noto Sans Arabic 更改为 Vazirmatn，为在波斯语中使用 Fedora Linux 的用户提供更一致的体验。


还有这些...

Fedora 项目中发生的很酷的事情！


Fedora CoreOS 和 Fedora Cloud Base 已升级为 “版本Edition” 级别！

Fedora Linux 系统安装程序，带有新 GUI 的 Anaconda 预览安装程序镜像将在大约一周内可用。我将发布一篇文章以提供更多详细信息，敬请关注！

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[在本文中，我们将讨论网络连接最基本的诊断工具之一：ping 命令。




如今，联网计算机变得十分普遍，以至于我们大多数人都理所当然地认为，房间一侧的计算机可以连接上房间另一侧的计算机，更不用说能连接上世界的另一端的计算机了。如此，网络使互联网、云、文件共享、媒体流、远程管理、打印等服务成为可能。但是当网络出现问题时，有时很难诊断到底是其中哪一环节出现了问题。下面，我们就来介绍：网络连接最基本的诊断工具之一—— ping 命令。

基本的 ping 命令

当你无法访问本地网络上的计算机或互联网上的服务器时，你可以 ping 它的 IP 地址。ping 将 互联网控制报文协议Internet Control Message Protocol（ICMP）数据包发送到目标 IP 地址。当我们要对网路连接状况进行判断时，ICMP 是个非常有用的协议，本质上 ICMP 是一个响应和应答信号。

让我们由近及远地进行故障排除。请先 ping 你自己的计算机，以确保你的计算机正在运行 网络栈networking stack。你正在操作的计算机称为 主机localhost，本地回环地址是：127.0.0.1。

ping 命令能用主机的 主机名 hostname、IP 地址（即 127.0.0.1）或者仅仅用简写 0 来表示 “主机”。

你可以使用 -c 选项，来控制发送数据包的 次数count。

$ ping 0 -c 1
PING 0 (127.0.0.1) 56(84) bytes of data.
64 bytes from 127.0.0.1: icmp_seq=1 ttl=64 time=0.069 ms

 Maybe certificates, contributing, or administrating servers? I already do administrate a bunch of arch and proxmox servers and I've been using arch on desktop since about a year, contributing code sounds very fun, I'm especially interested in low level development. Certificates bore the hell out of me though.
 By the way, I don't want to land a job at a shitty place like Microsoft or Google, I just want to be useful.

I don't know much about these tools though, besides that they are used mostly in resource-constrained systems.
 I was interested in learning a bit more about the differences between the *box and *base projects, and if there are any advantages or disadvantages on a full desktop environment.

11 月 15 日，Meta 公司发布了一个名为 Galactica 的新的大型语言模型。它是一个用于科学的大型语言模型，由 4800 万篇科学文章、网站文章、教科书、讲义和维基等训练而成。Meta 公司将其模型宣传为研究人员和学生的捷径，说它“可以总结学术论文，解决数学问题，生成维基文章，编写科学代码，为分子和蛋白质做注解，等等。”但是，像所有的语言模型一样，Galactica 只是一个无意识的机器人，无法区分事实与虚构。几小时内，科学家们就在社交媒体上分享了它有偏见和不正确的结果。三天后，Meta 撤下了它的在线演示版本。

中国在全球顶级芯片峰会上发表的论文数超越美国

国际固态电路会议（ISSCC）将于明年初在旧金山举行。据会议委员会称，本次会议通过了筛选的 198 篇论文中有 59 篇来自中国，42 篇来自美国，32 篇来自韩国。中国论文数从第三位上升到第一位，中国在每个类别的入选研究论文数量都有所增加。ISSCC 于 1954 年首次举行，它是该领域最大和最著名的国际会议。

对多因素认证的攻击正在增加

三年前，针对多因素认证（MFA）的攻击非常罕见，因为很少有机构启用 MFA。但随着微软、谷歌等开始推行多因素认证，对它的攻击开始增加。在这些攻击中，攻击者破坏了发给已经完成多因素认证的人的令牌，并复制该令牌以获得不同设备的访问。令牌是 OAuth 2.0 身份平台的核心，其目的是使用户的身份验证更简单、更快速，并能抵御密码攻击。微软的检测和响应团队发现攻击者为此目的利用令牌盗窃的情况有所增加。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[使用这个开源工具，即使是批量校正图像也很容易。


多年前，在翻阅一家旧书店的书架上的内容时，我偶然发现了一本名为 《UNIX System Command Summary for Berkeley 4.2 & 4.3 BSD》 的小册子，由 Specialized Systems Consultants 出版。我买它是出于好奇，因为它已经有将近 20 年的历史了，但仍然在很大程度上适用于现代 Linux 和 BSD。

无论是当时还是现在，我都很开心。一本写于 1986 年的小册子在 2016 年仍然很重要，而同一个书架上关于专有操作系统的书籍并不值得印刷它们的纸张。（想一想：你认为什么技术可以在僵尸末日中幸存下来？）这本小册子已经放在我自己的书架上好几年了，但我突然想到可能值得对这个作品做一点数字保存，所以我决定扫描这本小册子来创建一本 CBZ 电子书。

使用 Skanlite 进行扫描很容易，但很耗时。然而，当我完成后，我发现有些页面不是很平整。



在打印中，这称为配准问题，这意味着打印内容的位置在页面上的方向不正确。

ImageMagick

ImageMagick 是基于终端的非交互式图形编辑器。尝试在无图形环境（如纯文本终端）中编辑图形似乎违反直觉，但实际上很常见。例如，当你将图像上传到 Web 应用用作个人资料图片时，应用服务器上的脚本可能会使用 ImageMagick 或其库处理你的图像。非交互式编辑器的优点是你可以制定需要对示例图像执行的操作，然后只需按一下按钮即可将这些效果应用于数百个其他图像。

ImageMagick 通常与其他图形编辑器一样强大，只要你花时间了解它的许多功能以及如何组合它们以实现所需的效果。在这种情况下，我想旋转歪斜的页面。在搜索了 ImageMagick 的文档后，我发现我需要的解决方案的 ImageMagick 术语称为纠偏。将你的术语与其他人的术语保持一致对于你不知道的任何事情都是一个挑战，因此当你使用 ImageMagick（或其他任何东西）时，请记住，你描述问题或解决方案的用词可能和别人不一样。

要使用 ImageMagick 对带有弯曲文本的图像进行校正：

$ convert page_0052.webp -deskew25% fix_0052.webp


-deskew 选项表示可接受偏差的阈值。通过跟踪看似字母的对象的峰谷来确定倾斜。根据扫描的弯曲程度，你可能需要多于或少于 25% 的阈值。我已经达到了 80%，到目前为止，低于 25% 没用效果。

结果如下：



修复了！将其应用于文档的剩余 55 页以修复倾斜的页面，而对已经笔直的页面不做任何事情。换句话说，由于我的阈值设置，在不需要调整的页面上运行此命令是安全的。

使用 ImageMagick 裁剪图像

在纠正了歪斜之后，因为我扫描每一页都比必要的范围要多，以防止意外切断单词，我认为裁剪我纠正的页面是有意义的。我很高兴在页边空白处保留一些空间，但没有以前那么多。我经常使用 ImageMagick 的“裁剪”功能来处理这个网站上的图像，所以我很熟悉这个选项。但是，我需要确定如何裁剪每一页。

首先，我需要图像的大小：

$ identify fixed_0052.webp
WEBP 1128x2593 1128x2593+0+08-bit sRGB 114732B 0.020u 0:00.021


知道尺寸后，我能够对我可以承受的丢失多少像素做出一些估计。经过几次试运行，我得到了这个：

convert fix_0052.webp -gravity Center -crop 950x2450+0+0 crop_0052.webp


这并不完全适合，但当我将它应用于册子中的其他图像时，它被证明很重要。这些页面的内容和扫描仪位置各不相同，所以我很高兴给每一页一点空余空间。

这是校正和裁剪的图像：



使用开源批量编辑图像

ImageMagick 的美妙之处在于，当你确定了修复图像的公式，你就可以将该修复应用于需要相同修复的所有图像。我使用 GNU Parallel 执行此操作，它使用我所有的 CPU 内核来完成数百页的图像校正。这并不需要很长时间，而且结果不言而喻。更重要的是，我已经有了一个 UNIX 历史上有趣作品的数字档案。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[美国司法部在11月16日的新闻发布会上表示，两名俄罗斯国民，33岁的安东·纳波斯基（Anton Napolsky）和27岁的瓦莱莉雅·埃尔马科娃（Valeriia Ermakova）于11月3日在阿根廷科尔多瓦被捕。这两名俄罗斯公民被指控侵犯版权、电信诈骗和洗钱。同时，美国政府查封并关闭了Z-Library的249个在线域名，并撤除了该网站。


联邦检察官表示，Z-Library自2009年创建以来提供超过1100万本电子书供读者下载，但该网站提供的许多电子书受知识产权保护。


“被告从他们偷来的作品中非法获利，经常在作品出版几小时后就上传，在这个过程中，作者、出版商和书商受害，”纽约布鲁克林的司法部检察官布伦·皮斯(Breon Peace)说。


网站所有者通过捐款和收取部分访问费用，建立了一个由249个网站域名组成的网络，并通过一个易于访问的主页将它们链接起来，从而避免了多次封锁和关闭。


Z-Library，通常被称为z-lib，在许多国家因侵犯版权而受到法律攻击。


2022年8月，法国出版商联盟(French Publishers Union)称这些网站对出版业构成了严重威胁，并赢得了在法国封锁Z-Library网站的法院命令。


在去年的一份法庭文件中，美国作家协会(US Authors Guild)表示，Z-Library“可能是世界上最受瞩目、流量最大的图书盗版网站”。


美国作家协会表示，Z-Library与主要的合法下载服务一起出现在常规的网络搜索中，因此它们看起来是合法的。


停刊令世界各地的读者感到沮丧，包括许多学生在网上抱怨说，他们无法负担z图书馆提供的教科书的商业价格。


尼日利亚数字营销专家阿德瑞诺拉·阿约米德(Aderinola Ayomide)在脸书上写道：“使用这个网站的主要是那些买不起昂贵课本的学生、从事研究和撰写文章的人。”


菲律宾的卡莱尔·德拉·佩纳(Karyle Dela Pena)在脸书上写道，“Z-Library是我下载天体物理学教科书的唯一途径”，因为它们的成本通常很高。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[这些年来，我通过这些开源资源提高了我的 Python 技能。


我最近决定进一步学习 Python，以便提高我的教学技能，拓宽我的学生的视野。在这个过程中，我发现了这些优秀的资源，让我学习新的代码，并提高了对 Python 的整体理解。

1、《教孩子学编程 Python 语言版》

我的 Python 之旅大约是 7 年前开始的，当时我发现了 Apple LOGO 和 Python 中的 Turtle 模块 之间的联系。当时使用的 Linux 计算机的默认 Python 版本为 Python 2.7，我很快发现我想使用 Python 3。我成功地安装了它，并开始使用 Turtle 模块编写一些简单的程序。在阅读 Dr. Bryson Payne 的 《教孩子学编程 Python 语言版》 之后，我意识到 Python 不仅仅是 Turtle。那时我安装了 IDLE。

2、IDLE

在使用 IDLE 工作的过程中，交互式界面优化了我的体验，并让我有足够的信心来考虑向学生教授 Python。我志愿帮助我社区中的一群在家学习的孩子，很快我发现自己在教授一个有十六个孩子的班级！我很高兴他们的父母同意帮助我，否则我想我会被压垮。这个经历激发了我学习更多的欲望，以便我可以教授更多。

3.、Mu 编辑器

2018 年春天，我参加了 PyConUS。我听了一场由中学老师 Nicholas Tollervey 主讲的演讲，他为学龄前儿童编写了一个 Python 开发环境。Mu 编辑器 内置了一个可以帮助我找到代码中的错误的 质检工具Linter。Mu 帮助我提高了我的编码技能，我也能够与学生分享这些技能，他们也从中受益。

我的自信和经验增长后，我希望与更多的学生分享 Python 之旅。我与其他人合作撰写了一个申请书，以教授一个使用树莓派 4 和 Python 的课程。疫情打断了这个计划。在此期间，树莓派基金会发布了树莓派 400。2021 年春天，我使用了前一年开发的材料和一个来自当地图书馆的慷慨的资助，来 教授两组 学生如何编程。这个活动非常成功并在今年再次举办。

4、Codium

几年前，我了解到微软的 VS Code 是一个可以在 Linux 上使用的开源代码编辑器。我最近才了解到，如何在 VS Code 中配置和使用 Python 虚拟环境。我的问题在一篇 关于虚拟环境的文章 中得到了解答，这让我可以知道如何在 Linux 计算机上设置和配置 Python 虚拟环境。大约在同一时间，我发现了 Codium，一个围绕 VS Code 构建的社区项目。

现在我希望与我的学生分享 VS Codium 的体验，并让他们对 Python 的理解不再局限于 Turtle 模块。这种学习的热情让我寻找开源且可以在互联网上随意获得的教学资源。

5、《Python 编程练习，简单解释》

《Python 编程快速上手 让繁琐工作自动化》 这本书是我最喜欢的一本书。现在，作者已经发布了 《Python 编程练习，简单解释》。这两本书都可以免费在线阅读，并且都采用了知识共享许可证。

6、《每个人都可以使用 Python》

Dr. Charles Severance 在 2017 年发布了 《每个人都可以使用 Python》，我非常推荐这本书。他为像我这样的有抱负的程序员提供了简短的课程。课程的代码可以在 GitHub 上找到，所以你可以下载它并在自己的计算机或学校网络上安装它。

7. Python 视频

最近，我了解到 Jay LaCroix 在 YouTube 上有一系列精彩的视频，其中包括 28 个免费视频，从 Python 基础开始，涵盖了 Python 编程 的全面介绍。最重要的是，他使用的是 Linux 计算机，因此他的课程特别适合 Linux 编程环境。这些视频的其中一个收获是学习如何使用 nano 作为编程环境，它默认情况下包含在大多数 Linux 发行版中。

你的学习之路

此处提到的这七个资源帮助我成长为一名程序员，它们都是开源的并可以与其他人分享。你是如何提高编程技能的？你有什么要分享的吗？在评论中告诉我们。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[For many years now I have been using Linux, but I still qualify myself as a newbie, always assuming that I know much less than the person answering my question when asking questions about some topic. On one side I see that I now know much more than when I for the first time installed Ubuntu LTS 12.04, on the other, I know that I have never used some functionalities that are considered advanced knowledge. 
 My flavor of choice is Debian at the moment. I do not regret switching from Ubuntu. I find it to be simpler to use and solve problems, also help topics while rarer, are more to a point, and more helpful than those found for Ubuntu earlier. 
 Recently I have found out that I am now able to solve most problems with the use of the internet without having to ask a question. On the other hand, I have never compiled a program from a source or made a bash script other than some simple automation to add some folder structure. For a few months now I am running a small homelab which worked out better than expected. 
 There are topics to be learned, which are not really Linux knowledge (DNS, networking, ...) that Microsoft managed under the hood, but a Linux user must know more to be able to successfully configure it, but that's another story. 
 TLDR: Searching for a tool to assess my Linux knowledge. I am not really considering a certification exam, but that might also be an option, some cheaper one that won't break the bank while still being useful. I am looking for some self-assess tools (like language questionnaires). 
 Also, it might be time for some deeper knowledge, so resources (a book or a course) about Linux in depth would be helpful too.

By the way, if you want to read the writeup about LSM you can use the following link — https://medium.com/@boutnaru/linux-security-lsm-linux-security-modules-907bbcf8c8b4.
 Overall “Yama” is an LSM that was merged in kernel 3.4. The goal of “Yama” is to restrict the usage of the “ptrace” syscall (“man 2 ptrace”). Limiting the usage of “ptrace” is one way to isolate between running applications, thus even in case one application is breached it won’t be able to attach to other running applications (like browsers, crypto wallets, encryption apps, remote connection session and more) and read/write to sensitive data or change the f…]]></summary>

at the discussion around the GNU Tools Infrastructure proposal.


	Sourceware, a volunteer group that has been supporting various
	critical FOSS developer tools for more than two decades, is being
	courted by The Linux Foundation's Open Source Security Foundation
	(OpenSSF). The OpenSSF aims to improve open source software
	security by providing Sourceware projects with more modern IT
	infrastructure.

	But some members of the Sourceware community fear that accepting
	the help of the OpenSSF would give the corporate Linux world more
	leverage over FOSS developer tools. They would prefer to seek
	support from the Software Freedom Conservancy, a charitable
	non-profit that they believe is better aligned with software

 Can someone please share how linux rose to dominance over unix? From what I understand the emergence of the x86 chips made the hardware servers more scalable and there’s the attraction of open source software plus free. But what’s the reason behind the scale of the shift in preferred OS?
 Also is there any known competitor to linux now such that linux might be replaced and follow the path of unix? Thanks for your insights

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[一半的 macOS 恶意软件都来自一个“杀毒软件”

Elastic 安全实验室发现，一半 macOS 恶意软件来自 MacKeeper。讽刺的是，MacKeeper 声称 “以零努力保持你的 Mac 清洁和安全”。该程序可以被威胁者滥用，因为它有广泛的权限和对进程和文件的访问。这意味着，一个旨在保持 Mac 安全不受网络威胁的程序可能使你的系统处于危险之中。 MacKeeper 也以难以完全卸载而著称。然而，Mac 仍然是恶意软件最少的操作系统，研究发现只有 6.2% 的恶意软件出现在 macOS 上，而 Windows 和 Linux 上则分别为 54.4% 和 39.4%。

老王点评：这可真够讽刺的，一个杀毒软件反而是最大的黑窝。




开源推动 5G 占据了 50% 的电信市场

5G 部署现在已经超过 50% 的电信市场规模，这得益于开源。Linux 基金会称，在这一切的背后，“是向开放网络和框架的彻底转变。无论经济和政治风向如何，这种转变都在继续。事实上，开源可能是唯一没有受到影响的领域，因为它有能力跨越国界和边界来做需要做的事情。”据一些分析师的说法，到 2030 年，5G 的经济价值将达到 7 万亿美元。


消息来源：ZDNet



老王点评：开源居然对 5G 的推广有这么大的作用，这是有些想不到。




Mozilla 收入更多样，但仍然主要依靠谷歌

Mozilla 今天发布了其年度《Mozilla 状况》报告，2021 年，Mozilla 公司从搜索合作、订阅和广告收入中获得了 5.85 亿美元，比前一年增长了 25%。除了主要来自谷歌的搜索合作的收入之外，来自 Mozilla VPN、Mozilla MDN Plus、Pocket 等新产品的收入为 5700 万美元，与前一年相比增长了 125%。

老王点评：虽然 Mozilla 也有一些让人批评的地方，但是这已经是自由开源世界不多的重要旗舰了。]]></summary>

        <updated>2022-11-18T03:30:31.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[本文讲述如何一步步在 Linux 上安装 AWS CLI（命令行工具）。


AWS CLI 是一个能够和 AWS 账户进行交互的命令行程序。开发者和系统管理员用它管理日常的活动和自动化。

准备环节


安装好的 Linux 系统

具有管理员权限的 sudo 账户

能够联网


现在让我们开始安装：

1、下载安装文件

打开终端使用 curl 命令下载 AWS CLI 的安装文件：

$ curl "https://awscli.amazonaws.com/awscli-exe-linux-x86_64.zip" -o "awscliv2.zip"




以上命令会在当前工作目录下载一个 awscliv2.zip 的文件。

使用 ls 命令 确认当前下载下来的文件：

$ ls -l awscliv2.zip
-rw-rw-r-- 1 linuxtechi linuxtechi 47244662 Oct 20 10:53 awscliv2.zip
$


2、解压缩下载的文件

使用 unzip 命令 解压安装包：

$ unzip awscliv2.zip


它会在当前目录创建一个 aws 文件夹，把解压好的文件放进去：

$ ls -ld aws
drwxr-xr-x 3 linuxtechi linuxtechi 4096 Oct 19 17:18 aws
$


3、运行安装脚本

使用以下命令运行安装脚本：

$ sudo ./aws/install




脚本会把所有安装的文件放到 /usr/local/aws-cli 目录下，然后创建一个链接文件到 /usr/local/bin 目录。

4、检查 AWS CLI 的版本

运行以下脚本检查版本：

$ aws --version
aws-cli/2.8.4 Python/3.9.11 Linux/5.15.0-48-generic exe/x86_64.ubuntu.22 prompt/off
$


5、配置 AWS CLI

为了验证 AWS CLI 是否安装正确，开始配置 AWS CLI：

登录你的 AWS 管理控制台，取得 AWS 访问密钥 IDAccess Key ID 和 安全访问密钥Secret Access Key。

如果还没完成创建，请先创建，并把它们复制到安全的地方。



然后回到命令行，运行以下命令：

$ aws configure
AWS Access Key ID [None]: xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
AWS Secret Access Key [None]: xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
Default region name [None]: us-west-2
Default output format [None]: json
$


以上的证书会被保存到这个文件：

$ cat  ~/.aws/credentials


上面的命令的输出：



运行 aws 命令列出你账户中的 s3 储存和 VPC：

$ aws s3 ls
$ aws ec2 describe-vpcs


输出如下：



成功输出内容，说明你的 AWS CLI 已经配置完成。

这就是这篇文章的全部内容，请在下面的评论区发表你的疑问和反馈。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[这篇文章能让你了解如何使用 Checksec ，来识别一个可执行文件的安全属性，了解安全属性的含义，并知道如何使用它们。




编译源代码会生成一个二进制文件（LCTT 译注：即 .o 文件）。在编译期间，你可以向 gcc 编译器提供 标志flags，以启用或禁用二进制文件的某些属性，这些属性与安全性相关。

Checksec 是一个漂亮的小工具，同时它也是一个 shell 脚本。Checksec 可以识别编译时构建到二进制文件中的安全属性。编译器可能会默认启用一些安全属性，你也可以提供特定的标志，来启用其他的安全属性。

本文将介绍如何使用 Checksec ，来识别二进制文件的安全属性，包括：


Checksec 在查找有关安全属性的信息时，使用了什么底层的命令

在将源代码编译成二进制文件时，如何使用GNU 编译器套件GNU Compiler Collection（即 GCC）来启用安全属性。


安装 checksec

要在 Fedora 和其他基于 RPM 的 Linux 系统上，安装 Checksec，请使用以下命令：

$ sudo dnf install checksec


对于基于 Debian 的 Linux 发行版，使用对应的 apt 命令，来安装 Checksec。

$ sudo apt install checksec


shell 脚本

在安装完 Checksec 后，能够发现 Checksec 是一个单文件的 shell 脚本，它位于 /usr/bin/checksec，并且这个文件挺大的。Checksec 的一个优点是你可以通过快速通读这个 shell 脚本，从而了解 Checksec 的执行原理、明白所有能查找有关二进制文件或可执行文件的安全属性的系统命令：

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, I was thinking how (title) would be possible to do with least effort and i thought "would be nice if PATH was a function or some kind of pythonish @property ". I didn't want to write any function that would add my pwd to the path when i cd to it and then remove it when i change working dir again. And I didn't find anything useful while searching google for temporary path change (maybe i just can't "play prompt" uell).
 So i tried just binding function to PATH and it... worked?
 export PATH=$PATH:$pwd 
 I don't quite understand why it works, because _nothing_ is changed in PATH variable when I print it using env (maybe because it's bash builtin?) but it always searches PWD as if it was in PATH and I'm kinda happy it required no effort to setup. Sharing, maybe some ppl didn't know of such trick just as I didn't.

We are selling standalone boring, mainly desktop (although it runs on beefier laptops as well) software. It's for Windows and written in boring technologies (C99 for the engine and C# for GUI).
We are considering various business models when it comes to selling it in the future as our current one causes a lot of problems. Some options and thoughts I have about them right now:
1)What I call a "classical model" which we tried so far: release 1.0 version, sell it for a fixed price. Continue to support it for a while with bugfixes/features. At some point move to developing 2.0 version, sell it again (giving discounts for current 1.0 customers).
Advantages: simple, the customers can use software they purchased forever
Disadvantages: at some point you need to start collecting features…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The “charger_manager” kernel thread is created by a freezable workqueue https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/latest/source/drivers/power/supply/charger-manager.c#L1749) . Freezable workqueues are basically frozen when the system is moved to a suspend state (https://lwn.net/Articles/403891/).
 Based on the kernel source code “charger_manager” is responsible for monitoring the health (like temperature monitoring) of the battery and controlling the charger while the system is suspended to memory (https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/latest/source/drivers/power/supply/charger-manager.c) . Also, the “Charger Manager” kernel module is written by MyungJoo Ham. (https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/latest/source/drivers/power/supply/charger-manager.c#L1768).
 Moreover, the kernel documentation states that the “Charger Manager’’ also helps in giving an aggregated view to userspace in case they are multiple chargers for a battery. In case they are multiple batteries with different chargers on a system, that system would need multiple instances of “Charger Manager” (https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/v5.3/power/charger-manager.html) .
 On my Ubuntu VM (22.04.1 LTS) this kernel module is not compiled as a separate “*.ko” file. It is compiled into the kernel itself (builtin), as you can see in the output of “modinfo” in the screenshot below.
 charger_manager is a builtin kernel module (Ubuntu 22.04.1 LTS)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I often find some bit of interesting software and install it test for a week or two. Frequently, I end up changing something in defaults, whether theme or some other parameter, and this drops a config into my $XDG_CONFIG_HOME where the program supports it and just $HOME if not. There is a similar, but less noticeable, effect happening in $XDG_DATA_HOME and $XDG_CACHE_HOME.
 When I later remove the software after determining unsuitability or just general dislike, I'm left with an orphaned config file. I usually forget to purge it when I remove the program. This means I have a lot of orphaned configs files.
 Recently, I've taken to doing my testing in distrobox podman containers to more easily ensure that software, and ~all~ dependencies, get purged on un-install, but this does nothing for user-config files. I could re-train myself to be better about seek-n-destroying configs on software removal. Likewise, I could use a dotfiles manager to mark the configs I definitely want to keep and then set up a cron job to nuke $XDG_CONFIG_HOME and reload my "keepers." I really feel like have a program to scan my config-dirs and compare against installed user-space applications for autoremoval of orphaned configs is perhaps the better way to go. I also am fully aware of the challenges involved in writing such software.
 Nonetheless, and finally, the question:
 Is there already a program for cleaning up orphaned software-config files from $HOME?

Companies are increasingly interacting with their customers through communities on Slack and Discord. This trend will continue, because building a strong community around your product is a moat, leading to better retention and revenue. However, while Slack and Discord are great communication tools, they aren’t designed for community teams to engage with thousands of members at a personal level.  Moreover, community leaders don't have a good idea of who their members are. We solve these problems by letting them automate common tasks and by giving them visib…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[To make it easier to make Linux a target for native application development, why not just have a library that wraps the "native" UI toolkit of whatever DE you're using? Every toolkit could host their own (or have one created by the community), and any application that is built on it would automatically theme correctly and feel completely at home due to using the DE's standard widget kit under the hood.
 ​
 Older applications wouldn't draw in a ton of deps from an old UI kit, newer apps could work on older systems, etc. Of course this wouldn't be without drawbacks. The lowest denominator between all common toolkits would have to be used, making it fairly limited, but it might be a good option for simpler applications.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[通过安全的网络连接在远程计算机上调用命令或程序。


有一天，我正在测试如何在 将文件或目录复制到多个位置和系统时保持完整的文件权限。当我想检查远程系统上的文件权限时，我必须通过 SSH 登录它并检查属性。从远程系统多次登录和注销的过程让我有点烦，我想，如果我可以在远程 Linux 系统上通过 SSH 执行命令就好了。

幸运的是，在浏览了 ssh 命令的手册页后，我找到了一个解决办法。

如果你想知道如何本地运行远程系统上运行命令或脚本，而不登录到远程系统，下面的内容会告诉你如何做。

1、通过 SSH 在远程 Linux 系统上执行命令

从本地系统通过 SSH 在远程系统上运行命令或脚本的典型方法是：

$ ssh <username@IP_Address-or-Doman_name> <Command-or-Script>


允许我给你们举几个例子：

1.1、通过 SSH 在远程系统上运行单个命令

假设你想要 查找远程 Linux 系统的内核详细信息。为此，只需运行：

$ ssh sk@192.168.225.22 uname -a


这里，


sk 是远程系统的用户名，

192.168.225.22 是远程系统的 IP 地址，

uname -a 是我想在远程系统上运行的命令。


示例输出：



看到没？我并没有实际登录到远程系统，但通过 SSH 在远程系统上执行了 uname 命令，并在本地系统的终端上显示了输出。

你还可以像下面这样用引号指定命令。

$ ssh sk@192.168.225.22 "uname -a"


或者，

$ ssh sk@192.168.225.22 'uname -a'


如果你已经 更改了 SSH 协议的默认端口，只需使用 -p 参数指定它。

意大利移动应用开发商 Bending Spoons 公司今天宣布收购印象笔记（Evernote）。在收购的新闻稿中说，“印象笔记拥有约 1 亿美元的经常性收入，数百万付费客户，以及使用其跨平台应用程序创建的近 110 亿条笔记。”印象笔记曾经是最流行的笔记应用之一，但在 2016 年开始限制免费用户的使用。在同一年还宣布开发了可以审查用户笔记的 AI，以及让其员工可以访问用户笔记，虽然在招致巨大反对后取消了计划，但也导致了大量用户流失。如今，在 iOS 上，它甚至没有跻身生产力应用程序的前 100 名。收购宣告没有公开收购金额等细节。

AlmaLinux 9.1 紧随 RHEL 9.1 发布

红帽企业 Linux（RHEL）9.1 今天正式发布，RHEL 9.1 将 PHP 8.1 作为支持的应用流，扩展了多级安全支持，支持将容器嵌入到镜像构建器蓝图中等等一系列更新增强。而仅仅半天后，作为 RHEL 9.1 的自由构建版本，AlmaLinux 9.1 就发布了。

老王点评：我觉得 CentOS 的结束至少有一个好处，RHEL 的自由版本发布的更快了，以前都需要几周。




KDE 宣布新的社区目标：可访问性、环境可持续性、自动化

在今年的 KDE 年度开发者大会上，KDE 宣布了新的社区目标。他们希望把重点放在确保 KDE 软件对所有人都是无障碍的。之前的 KDE 社区目标是围绕着一致性、对 KDE 应用程序的关注和 Wayland 支持。


消息来源：Phoronix



老王点评：我还是觉得之前的目标更务实一些，目前的 KDE 虽然已经很棒了，但是距离最好还有一些距离。

        <link href="https://www.williamlong.info/archives/6995.html"/>
        <updated>2022-11-17T05:18:13.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[11月17日，动视暴雪（简称暴雪）投资者官网发布消息称，由于与网易公司的现行许可协议将于2023年1月23日到期，将暂停在中国大部分暴雪游戏服务。包括魔兽世界、炉石传说、魔兽争霸III：重制版、守望先锋、星际争霸系列、暗黑破坏神 III和风暴英雄。


《暗黑破坏神：不朽》的共同开发和发行则涉及两家公司另外的单独协议。暴雪总裁迈克 伊巴拉（Mike Ybarra）表示，公司正寻找替代方案。2008年8月，暴雪与网易达成代理协议，此后多次续约，双方累计合作长达14年。


“近20年来，我们一直通过网易和其他合作伙伴将我们的游戏带到中国，我们非常感谢中国社区展现出的热情，”暴雪总裁迈克 伊巴拉（Mike Ybarra）表示，“他们的热情和创造力激励着我们，我们正在寻找替代方案，以便在未来将我们的游戏带回给玩家。”


11月17日上午，网易港股跌超10%。


对此，网易方面在接受《证券日报》记者采访时表示，“网易一直在尽最大努力和动视暴雪公司谈判，希望推进续约。经过长时间的谈判，我们仍然无法就一些合作的关键性条款与动视暴雪达成一致。我们非常遗憾动视暴雪在今天先行宣布了停止合作，我们将不得不接受此决定。网易将继续履行职责，为我们的玩家服务到最后一刻。”


对于玩家游戏资产处理，网易回应称，公司后续会发声明通知玩家，以玩家公告为准，具体情况目前不方便透露。


关于暴雪与网易的续约风波，据观察者网援引知情人士报道，暴雪方针对续约提出的条件包括，暴雪方分成较2019-2022合约期50%以上营收和净利润提高，暴雪还要求网易按照《暗黑破坏神：不朽》模式，研发暴雪其他IP手游全球发行，但网易只享有中国区市场营收分成。同时，暴雪还要求网易缴纳巨额保证金或预付费用来担保第2条的完成，否则将被“处罚”。


据“界面新闻”报道，有接近暴雪中国的人士向其透露，“要求网易打白工”的说法不实。观察者网的报道所述三点均明显不符实际：在分成上，暴雪并未狮子大开口，要求进一步大幅提高分成比例 ；而在游戏定价收费上，暴雪也未要求网易执行全球同步策略，即在中国区提价。


在双方停止合作后，若暴雪想要更换中国代理商，则需要面临正在运营的游戏的版号需要调整的问题。北京元合律师事务所合伙人、游戏法专家孙磊向记者表示，如果《魔兽世界》《炉石传说》等游戏因为本次授权合约到期而停服，那么就意味着此前其取得的版号作废；但如果暴雪找到了新的合作商，且网易愿意提供配合，那么做好变更登记后，原有的版号仍可沿用。


据了解，此前网易与暴雪共同成立了上海网之易网络科技发展有限公司，致力于暴雪旗下《魔兽世界》《星际争霸2》等游戏在中国大陆的运营，相关游戏的电竞赛事组织运营也由网之易主导，据业内人士透露，网之易公司内部员工存在分别隶属于网易和暴雪的两套班底。


暴雪对网易正式发出“分手函”后，其下一个代理商将花落谁家，成为了资本市场和游戏圈颇为关注的话题。“目前可以透露的是，有不止一家国内游戏厂商在争夺暴雪在中国的代理权，但暴雪似乎还没有做出最后的选择。”一位不愿具名的游戏公司员工表示。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[路透社报道，推特新老板马斯克(Elon Musk)在一封电子邮件中告诉员工，他们必须决定是否愿意留下并“在高强度下长时间工作”，或者接受离职补偿。在发出这一最后通牒之前，马斯克已在本月早些时候解雇了这家社交媒体公司大约一半的员工。


根据《华尔街日报》看到的这封电邮，员工必须在美东时间周四下午5点前填写一份谷歌表格，表明他们是否愿意留在Twitter，接受高强度的工作。


马斯克前夜在一封电子邮件中写道：“今后，为了打造出一个突破性的Twitter 2.0，并在一个竞争日益激烈的世界中取得成功，我们需要采取非常硬核的工作态度。这将意味着在高强度下长时间工作。只有出色的表现才能取得合格的成绩。”





在发出这封电邮之前，马斯克上周给员工发了一份备忘录，警告说公司面临严峻的经济挑战，他在备忘录中说破产是一种可能性。《华尔街日报》看到了这份备忘录。另据知情人士透露，同样在上周，马斯克在10月底接管Twitter后的首次全体员工会议上谈到了结束大多数员工的远程工作选项，这位亿万富豪称，员工需要在条件允许的情况下回到办公室上班。


推特近期刚无预警解雇约4400合约员工，以及近3700全职员工。


马斯克认为，推特是他以出售155亿美元（约212亿新元）特斯拉（Tesla）持股，以及承担数以10亿计美元债务的代价而“拯救”的公司。因此，在经济不景气下，如果推特不开始赚更多钱，公司就可能破产。他也要求员工停止居家办公，且每周工作80小时。

在过去几年内，我有幸和中学生们一起，并带他们入门 Python 开发 和树莓派 400。这一切都很有趣，树莓派对于学生和我来说都是一个很好的平台。我们使用了 Code with Mu，并且一切都很成功。我们的 Python 技能随着经验的增长而增长，因此最近我开始寻找给这些学生提供更多东西的方法。

我参与了一个 Python 课程并在课程中接触了微软的 Visual Studio Code。我在课程中学到了很多关于如何为 Python 设置虚拟环境，以及如何为 Python 编程配置 VS Code 的知识。在学习过程中，我也认识了 Codium，它基本上是没有微软品牌和遥测的 VS Code。

如果你正在寻找一个优秀的、通用的、开源的、带有 Python 集成的代码编辑器，那么你可以尝试一下 Codium。下面是我在 Linux 系统上为 Python 设置 Codium 的方法。

在 Linux 上安装或更新 Python

首先，确保你正在运行最新版本的 Python。你可以使用你的软件包管理器来完成这项工作。在 Debian 和基于 Debian 的系统上：

$ sudo apt install python3-pip


在 Fedora、CentOS、Mageia、OpenMandriva 和类似的系统上：

$ sudo dnf update python3


在某些系统上，你可能还需要安装创建 Python 虚拟环境的软件：

$ sudo apt install python3.10-venv


安装 Codium

接下来，在你的电脑上 安装 Codium。在 Linux 上，你可以下载一个包…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[在这篇文章中，我们将逐步解释如何在 RHEL 9 系统上安装 Node.js。


Node.js 基于谷歌的 V8 JavaScript 引擎构建，它是一个自由开源的跨平台 JavaScript 运行时环境，主要用于构建服务器端应用。它使用事件驱动和异步模型，帮助开发人员构建高度可扩展的数据密集型的实时应用（RTA）。你可以使用 NodeJS 来构建前端和后端应用。

Node.js 通常用于构建以下应用：


聊天应用

流媒体应用

浏览器游戏

命令行工具

嵌入式系统


在其技术栈中使用 NodeJS 的顶级公司包括 PayPal、NetFlix 和 Uber 等等。

安装 Node.js 主要有以下三种方式：


从 NodeSource 仓库安装 Node.js

从发行版的官方仓库安装 Node.js

使用 NVM 安装 Node.js


让我们看看如何使用这些方法在 RHEL 9 上安装 Node.js。

先决条件：


最小化安装的 RHEL 9 系统

具有管理员权限的 sudo 用户

互联网连接

Red Hat 订阅或本地配置的仓库


从 NodeSource 存储库安装 Node.js

NodeSource 是一家技术公司，旨在帮助组织运行生产就绪的 Node.js 应用，关注资源使用以及增强的安全性和应用程序性能。它提供了最新版本的 Node.js 和 NPM。

要从 NodeSource 安装 Node.js，首先，按如下所示更新系统包。

$ sudo dnf update -y




接下来，安装这期间所需的构建工具。其中包括 GCC C/C++ 编译器、Perl 和 Python 调试器等等。

$ sudo dnf groupinstall 'Dev…]]></summary>

it does

to demystify some of that, especially with respect to its use of
networking.  He 
wanted to contrast the needs of HFT with those of the traditional networking
as it is used outside of the HFT space.  He also has some thoughts on what
the Linux kernel could do to help address those needs so that HFT companies

I'm Gabriel, founder of Meticulous.
Our mission is to make the world's code safe, performant and reliable. We're starting with a tool to catch JavaScript regressions in web applications with zero-effort from developers.
How it works: Insert a single line of JavaScript onto your site, and we record thousands of real user sessions. We then replay these sessions on new code to automatically catch bugs before they hit production. You can watch a 60-second demo at meticulous.ai.
We are a London-based YC company. Our engineering team previously worked at Dropbox, Opendoor and Google. We just raised $4m, and are backed by some of the best founders and technical leaders in Silicon Valley, including Guillermo Rauch (founder Vercel, author next.js), Jason Warner (CTO GitHub), Scott Belsky (C…]]></summary>

 I am trying to run the Windows Powershell binary in Linux. There is a native Powershell available for Linux, but the available libraries for Linux PS differ from those available in Windows. E.g., some tools for ActiveDirectory and Excel are not available under Linux.
 Has anyone successfully run Windows PowerShell (current version) under Wine? This is for a command line utility that queries an ActiveDirectory server and outputs reports to Excel. I did write a Go version but unfortunately the folks who will maintain the code only know Powershell.
 I found some threads on WineHQ and on Reddit, but no walkthroughs. 
 https://forum.winehq.org/viewtopic.php?t=33963
 https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/pz28xz/running_windows_powershell_script_in_endeavour_os/
 I've tried with Winetricks and Bottles so far, but get DLL errors when launching. .NET and other libraries were installed. Others have copied DLLs from Windows to work around missing DLLs but this is not an option for me.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Michael and Yury here – we're building a no-code analytics platform for growth teams that automatically generates actionable data insights.
After working in the data space for many years, we realized there was still a huge gap in the marketing analytics market. Growth teams have so much marketing and advertising data, yet this siloed data is not actionable.
The existing BI and search-driven analytics solutions are designed for data-savvy people. In our experience (previously built an NLP company called FriendlyData), non-technical people just don't know what questions to ask.
So we decided to try a different approach: Narrative BI automatically generates a personalized feed of insights. You just need to connect your data sources (takes 2 min to set up), and you will get automated narratives, alerts, and reports in minutes.
We currently support UA, GA4, Google Ads, and Facebook Ads, but many more integrations will be added soon.
You can try it out for free and give feedback or roast it in the comments section. Just connect your data source, and you'll start getting narratives in 5 minutes.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Meta has announced
the open-source release of part of its internal source-code management
system, called Sapling.


	Sapling began 10 years ago as an initiative to make our monorepo
	scale in the face of tremendous growth. Public source control
	systems were not, and still are not, capable of handling
	repositories of this size. Breaking up the repository was also out
	of the question, as it would mean losing monorepo’s benefits, such
	as simplified dependency management and the ability to make broad
	changes quickly. Instead, we decided to go all in and make our
	source control system scale.

	Starting as an extension to the Mercurial open source project, it
	rapidly grew into a system of its own with new storage formats,
	wire protocols, algorithms, and behaviors. Our ambitions grew along
	with it, and we began thinking about how we could improve not only
	the scale but also the actual experience of using source control.


At this point, only the client side of the system has been released; the
company "hopes to" release the rest later.]]></summary>

 This will interest those who do Game Dev on Linux, not only was 5.1.0 released, but we also officially have got the Quixel Plugin for Linux.
 To say, not so long ago we had to compile the engine every update ourselves, so precompiled engine is great to have. This is a huge step forward with UE.
 Some of the notable improvements on the Linux side of things are to do with Clion & Rider detection on this patch.

一百年前的实体书如果保存良好，可以正常阅读。但十年前的电子书今天去阅读极有可能会遇到各种问题。电子书需要不断维护，从文件格式到存储介质的不断变化，需要不断重新处理。电子书是脆弱且受到威胁的。

美国的 Frontier 超算继续占据 TOP500 榜首

第 60 版 TOP500 显示，Frontier 系统仍然是名单上唯一拥有 Exaflop 级别算力的超级计算机。Frontier 的 HPL 分数和之前一样，1.102 EFlop/s，但是确是第二名的三倍。之前连续两年占据榜首的日本富岳超级计算机依旧保持第二名。中国排名前十的两台超算依旧是神威-太湖之光和天河-2A。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[据《每日邮报》11月15日报道，据知情人士透露，马斯克似乎在进一步削减成本，即将准备让推特员工自费在公司食堂用餐，而此前推特食堂是免费的，这招引来员工的愤怒。


亿万富翁马斯克在上个月以440亿美元的交易额正式接管了推特。此后，他解雇了推特首席执行官，并解雇了公司一半的员工，包括数千名合同工。


继裁员计划后，特斯拉CEO马斯克又在考虑新的成本削减措施，计划取消推特旧金山总部的免费午餐，转而让员工付费。他在推特上称，在过去的12个月里，每顿午餐的成本预计超过400美元，使得旧金山总部的年度餐饮服务成本达到约1300万美元。


马斯克的这番言论招致了推特前员工雷西·霍金斯（Tracy Hawkins）的强烈反对。霍金斯之前是推特负责“工作转型”（work transformation）的副总裁，负责推特总部的免费午餐计划。霍金斯称，事实上每人每天的餐费约为20美元至25美元。


此外，在员工入住率（员工到公司办公）方面，霍金斯和马斯克也存在着分歧。马斯克表示，员工的最高入住率为25%，而平均入住率不到10%。而霍金斯对这些数字提出了质疑，称办公室的入住率在20%到50%之间。


马斯克回应称：“记录显示员工最高在岗率为25%，平均在岗率低于10%。准备早餐的人比吃早餐的人多。他们甚至懒得提供晚餐，因为楼里没人。”


此前几天，马斯克解雇了数千名负责筛选网站上错误信息的合同工。一些合同工说，他们直到周六无法上班时，才意识到自己被解雇了。据科技网站《平台》的记者凯西牛顿称，5500名合同工中约有4400人被解雇。


在考虑取消免费午餐之际，马斯克数日前刚刚致信推特员工称，称公司将取消远程办公，无特殊情况，员工每周至少要在办公室工作40个小时。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[今天我很兴奋地与大家分享成千上万的 Fedora 项目贡献者的辛勤工作成果：Fedora Linux 37 版本来了！让我们看看这个最新版本给你带来了什么。一如既往，在从以前的版本升级之前，你应该确保你的系统是完全最新的。迫不及待地想开始了吗？在你阅读的同时 下载！


下载 Fedora Linux 37


两个新的版本

Fedora 的各个“版本Edition”是针对某一特定“市场”的旗舰产品。在 Fedora Linux 37 中，我们增加了两个新版本：Fedora CoreOS 是你可能还记得的 Atomic Host 的后续版本。从 Project Atomic 和 CoreOS 的初始的工作中汲取营养，它提供了一种自动更新机制，以托管基于容器的工作负载。通过原子更新和简单的回滚，它为你的基础设施增加了安全感。

Fedora Cloud 也作为一个版本回来了。云计算工作组的活动已经重新开始了。Cloud 版本提供了一个很棒的 Fedora 基础，可以在你喜欢的公共或私有云中运行。AMI 将在本周晚些时候在 AWS 市场上提供，在社区频道上现在已经可以使用。请查看 此网站 以了解可以在其他云供应商或你自己的云上运行的镜像！

桌面的改进

Fedora Workstation 专注于桌面体验。像往常一样，Fedora Workstation 采用了最新的 GNOME 版本。GNOME 43 在设置中包括一个新的设备安全面板，为用户提供关于系统中硬件和固件的安全信息。在上一个版本的基础上，更多的 GNOME 核心应用程序被移植到了最新版本的 GTK 工具包，提供了更好的性能和现代的外观。

在这个版本中，我们做了一些改变，让你的安装变得更精简。我们把 Firefox 浏览器的语言包分成了子包。这意味着如果你不需要本地化，你可以删除 firefo…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Linux Mint 的更新管理器变得更有用了！




Linux Mint 的更新管理器是该发行版的一个重要组成部分，它使新用户可以获得更为方便简易的体验。

最近的一次更新 Linux Mint 21 推出了许多改进，包括更新管理器对 Flatpak 的支持。

你只需要更新你的系统就可以获得这些改进。

⭐ 更新管理器中支持 Flatpak



是的，你没看错。这终于实现了。

Flatpak 支持已被添加到更新管理器中，用户只需单击几下就能更新 Flatpak 应用程序和运行时。

这将为进一步改善用户体验的统一更新体验提供了帮助。

这对新用户来说很有好处，他们不需要熟悉终端命令就能更新 Flatpak。此外，你不需要将 Flatpak 与软件中心集成（对于 GNOME 而言）。

换句话说，Linux Mint 团队增强了你使用 Flatpak 应用程序的体验。

除了对 Flatpak 的支持，本次更新还包括对 Linux Mint 21 的更多增强，这是一个开箱即用的更新。

这些改进包括：

对角栏的改进



Linux Mint 21 中的 角栏Corner Bar 添加了两项新特性：


能够在角栏设置左键点击和中键点击的动作；你可以配置它以显示桌面、工作区选择器或桌面。

一个允许你将鼠标悬停在角栏上以显示桌面的新选项。


Nemo 的更新



Nemo 文件管理器做了一些调整；现在，当文件被选中时，只会高亮显示文件名，而不是图标和文件名。

如果你还不知道, 你也可以通过我们建议的一些调整来增强 Nemo 文件管理器的体验：


调整 Linux 中的 Nemo 文件管理器，让它更好用的 15 种方法


此外，桌面图标被垂直翻转，桌面上下文菜单中添加了一个新的快捷方式，可以快速打开显示设置。

更少的密码提示

这是很多人可能喜欢的另一个用户体验调整。

当删除 Flatpak 或任何快捷方式或本地应用程序时，它将不再要求你输入密码。

类似地，在新立得（LCTT 译注：Linux 下的一个包管理工具）和更新管理器的情况下，将使用 pkexec 来记住密码。

这样，用户就不需要每次执行多个操作时都输入密码。

你可以浏览 Linux Mint 月度博客 以了解其它变化。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The scalability of Linus Torvalds was a
recurring theme during Linux's early years; these days maintainer struggles
are a recognized problem within open-source
communities in general.  It is thus not surprising that Sean Christopherson
gave a talk at Open Source Summit Europe (and KVM Forum) with the title
"Scaling KVM and its community".  The talk mostly focused on KVM for the
x86 architecture—the largest and most mature KVM architecture—which
Christopherson

applied to other KVM architectures, or even other Linux subsystems, so that

Deep Lake stores complex data such as images, audio, videos, annotations/labels, and tabular data, in the form of tensors—a type of data structure used in linear algebra, which AI systems like to consume.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[11月15日下午消息，去年5月，多家媒体报道称，郑州车主温先生自称花150万买的特斯拉Model X在高速行驶中突然降速，且刹车失灵。该车主希望特斯拉承认刹车系统出问题，并对他进行道歉。


当时，特斯拉回应称，初步诊断车辆报警原因为右前轮速传感器警报，并非温先生所述的“刹车失灵”。


特斯拉还称，车主向特斯拉提出免费更换至新款Model X车型的诉求，但特斯拉对此无法予以满足。


但不久后，一段网上流传的疑似温先生与他人对话录音显示，温先生疑似自己“策划”了这场维权行动，目的是通过舆论压力，使特斯拉对其进行“一赔三”。


随后，特斯拉以侵犯名誉权为由，将温先生告上法庭。


近日，该案件宣判。民事判决书显示，原告特斯拉胜诉。


据判决书显示，河南省郑州市管城回族区人民法院认定温先生的言论侵害了特斯拉汽车（北京）公司的名誉权。法院判决，温先生需在《河南法制报》上向特斯拉公开道歉，并支付赔偿款1万元。]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[你可以通过以下方式确定你的 Linux 发行版中是否正在运行 systemd 或其它初始化系统。


首个进程在你启动 Linux 发行版时开始运行，它称为初始化进程 init（初始化initialization的缩写）。它的进程标识符为 1（即 pid=1）。基于 Unix 的系统中的所有进程和应用程序都是这个初始化进程的后代。

根据功能和特性，存在不同类型的初始化进程。例如，systemd、Runit、OpenRC、sysVinit 等。其中，systemd 是最流行和最现代的一种，被包括 Ubuntu 和 Fedora 在内的所有现代 Linux 发行版使用和采用。

与传统的基于 Unix 的初始化系统相比，systemd 及其性能一直存在争议。但这就是另外一个话题了。

让我们看看如何确定在 Linux 发行版中运行的是 systemd 还是其它初始化系统。

systemd 还是其它初始化系统？

不幸的是，没有直接的命令可以找到它。你可以从初始化进程追溯它，它基本上是到 /sbin/init 的符号链接，即 pid=1。

使用 strings 命令打印嵌入在二进制文件 /sbin/init 中的文本并使用以下命令搜索 init：

strings /sbin/init | grep init


示例 1

在下面的输出中，它是一个运行 Debian（Peppermint OS）的 sysVinit 系统。如你所见，它清楚地显示了 init 进程名称。

strings /sbin/init | grep init




如果在上述同一个系统中找 systemd，那么不会有任何结果。因此，你可以得出结论，你正在运行 sysVinit 而不是 systemd。

示例 2

如果你在 systemd 系统中运行上述命令，你可以在输出的第一行轻松看到 systemd 及其版本。

strings /sbin/init | grep systemd




示例 3

你也可以尝试使用 pstree 命令打印进程树，它应该会显示第一个进程名称。它应该是 systemd 或 init，如下例所示。

pstree






这就好了。这样你就可以轻松找出你的发行版是使用 systemd 还是其他的。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[手写代码导致美国宇航局的水手号探测器失败

1962 年夏天，美国宇航局启动了水手 1 号任务，这是一项无人驾驶的任务，该装置将飞过金星并探测数据。当时的工程师通常在纸上写出他们的代码。然后这些代码通过一个复杂的系统被翻译成计算机可读的卡片，然后通过计算机执行该程序。这种手工使得意外错误率变得很高。缺失的符号与字符最终导致了水手 1 号任务的彻底失败。这次任务在当时花费了大约 1800 万美元，相当于今天的 1.5 亿美元。

老王点评：计算机发展早期，不说流程，就是工具也很简陋。但是就是这样，也送上天那么多飞行器。




一个简单的安卓锁屏漏洞获得了 7 万美元

研究人员发现，任何能拿到谷歌 Pixel 手机的人都可以通过换上自己的 SIM 卡，并输入预设的恢复代码，从而绕过安卓操作系统的锁屏保护。这个漏洞的利用非常简单，但谷歌花了大约五个月的时间来修复。谷歌为此向他支付了 7 万美元的奖金。

老王点评：看似这个钱挣的容易，但是实际上研究人员投入了大量精力才可能遇到这样一块“狗头金”。




英特尔推出深度伪造实时检测工具

深度伪造视频现在无处不在，你可能见过名人做或说他们实际上从未做过的事情的视频。英特尔开发了 FakeCatcher，这项技术能够以 96% 的准确率检测虚假人脸视频。这是世界上第一个实时深度伪造检测器，它可以在几毫秒内返回结果。该工具是通过检测视频像素中微妙的“血流”信号，在真实视频中寻找真实的线索。当心脏泵血时，人的静脉会改变颜色，这些血流信号是可以从面部各处收集的，算法将这些信号翻译成时空图。然后，利用深度学习，就可以立即检测出一个视频是真的还是假的。

老王点评：果然魔高一尺，道高一丈。不过我想深度伪造可能很快就会学会添加血流信号。]]></summary>

        <updated>2022-11-15T01:25:43.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you want to use a terminal based file manager over ssh (lf or ranger), but the server doesn't have ranger in the repos (synology NAS), or you don't have sudo privileges to install it on the server, here's a solution:
 Use sshfs to mount that server path.
 sudo mkdir /mnt/server Or any directory name you want.
 Run id and take note of your uid and gid. 
 Change ownership of that directory so that it doesn't require sudo anymore:
 sudo chown -r uid:gid /mnt/server 
 Now you can see and edit that path with your regular user. 
 sshfs <username>@<ip_address>:/path/ /mnt/server
 If you want to use your RSA key instead, so that you don't have to type the password every time do:
 sshfs -o IdentityFile=/path/to/.ssh/private_key \ <username>@<ip_address>:/path/ /mnt/server 
 You can now browse to it from ranger or lf, then bookmark it with the m key.
 To have a shortcut in the home directory, run: ln -s "/mnt/server" "$HOME/server"
 To un-mount it, do: fusermount -u /mnt/server
 The reason I like to use ranger over ssh, is the same reason I like to use it locally. It's incredibly faster to navigate using ranger than any GUI file manager, plus I have access to vim in case I want to bulk rename, or edit dotfiles, and other cool keybinds set to other stuff.
 I hope you found this helpful. :)

 Does such a learning tool exist? Or are there tools that can dump these entries and inodes?

 Parted Magic: Collection of programs and tools to detect, repair or recover data from corrupt hard drives. Unfortunately paid.
 GRUB Boot Repair Tool: As the name implies. Just repairs or reinstalls GRUB on an existing system. Saved my laptop twice with this.
 Puppy Linux: Very lightweight Distro designed to be ran on old or low spec PCs. Used it to backup all the files from my very first PC (With only 256MB of RAM!) and it didn't take an hour just to boot. 
 I've got all these on my Ventoy USB and would love to build a set of useful Distros like these just for the sake of it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I tried switching to Wayland a while back during the covid lockdowns, and while I loved how smooth it was, some issues prevented me from sticking with it. Mainly the inability to present my screen on Google Meet conversations on Chromium and being unable to use color pickers. Two things I do very frequently. Have those been fixed?
 I am considering switching again eventually, so what is the state of Wayland currently? Is the experience currently on par with X11 or are there problems average users will eventually face if they switch now?
 What still needs to be fixed/polished on Wayland before the user experience for most people is better than X11's?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm a big fan of shell scripts. What I missed is a CLI "calculator". But not just to do simple operations on numbers. It would be nice to have some Computer Algebra System available through CLI.
 For impatient - github
 So I made such a tool. Here's a simple use case:  $ amcli eval "1 / 2" 0.5 $ amcli eval "e ^ pi > pi ^ e" True 
 Here's differentation:  $ amcli diff x "sin(x) + b * ln(x)" cos(x) + 1 / x * b 
 Let's solve some equation  $ amcli solve x "a x^3 = b" (b / a) ^ (1/3) (-1/2 + i * 1/2 * sqrt(3)) * (b / a) ^ (1/3) (-1/2 + i * sqrt(3/4) * (-1)) * (b / a) ^ (1/3) 
 Let's convert to LaTeX:  $ amcli latex "1/2 + sqrt(3)" \frac{1}{2}+\sqrt{3} 
 We can also pipe:  $ echo "sin(x) + cos(x)" | amcli sub x "y/z" | amcli diff y cos(y / z) * z / z ^ 2 + -sin(y / z) * z / z ^ 2  (so we substituted y/z instead of x and then differentiated over y)
 So let's quickly compute the gradient of a neural network with MSE loss function!  echo "[ x_1, x_2, x_3 ]" \ | amcli sub X _ "[[ w_11, w_12, w_13 ], [ w_21, w_22, w_23 ], [ w_31, w_32, w_33 ]] * X" \ | amcli fsimp \ | amcli sub X _ "e ^ X / (1 + e ^ X)" \ | amcli fsimp \ | amcli sub X _ "[ v_1, v_2, v_3 ]T * X" \ | amcli fsimp \ | amcli sub pred _ "(pred - target)^2" \ | amcli diff w_21 \ | amcli fsimp 
 Why?
 To automate tasks in shell. That means, it's computer algebra which is language-agnostic. Simple example: some plugin for text editor to replace LaTeX code instead of a formula when selected.
 It's also simple, small (8.7 M by the time of writing this) and with nearly-zero startup overhead.
 It's finally free, under GNU GPL v3. I also intend to make it more cross-platform (right now it's only available for win-x64, linux-x64, osx-64).

 Releases to try it out!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[大家好！今年早些时候，我在写《DNS 是如何工作的》 时，有人问我——为什么人们有时在域名的末尾加一个点？例如，如果你通过运行 dig example.com 查询 example.com 的 IP，你会看到一下内容：

$ dig example.com
example.com.        5678    IN  A   93.184.216.34


执行完 dig 命令后，example.com 有一个 . ——变成了 example.com.！发生了什么？

有些 DNS 工具也要求传给它的域名后加一个 .：如果你在使用 miekg/dns 时传给它 example.com，它会报错：

// trying to send this message will return an error
m := new(dns.Msg)
m.SetQuestion("example.com", dns.TypeA)


最初我以为我知道这个问题的答案（“呃，末尾的点意味着域名是完全限定的？”）。这是对的 —— 一个完全限定域名fully qualified domain name（FQDN）是一个末尾有 . 的域名！

但是为什么末尾的点是有用且重要的呢？

在 DNS 的请求/响应中，域名的末尾并没有 “.”

我曾经（错误地）认为 “为什么末尾有一个点？”的答案可能是 “在 DNS 请求/响应中，域名末尾有一个 .，所以我们把它放进去，以匹配你的计算机实际发送/接收的内容”。但事实并不是这样！

当计算机发送 DNS 请求/响应时，域名的末尾并没有点。实际上，域名中没有点。

域名会被编码成一系列的长度/字符串对。例如，域名 example.com 被编码为这 13 个字节。

7example3com0


编码后的内容一个点也没有…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[本指南介绍了如何在没有互联网连接的情况下离线更新 Ubuntu 的步骤。


在很多情况下，你可能需要在没有互联网连接的情况下更新你的 Ubuntu 系统。你可能在外地不方便上网，也可能你需要更新一堆未联网的 Ubuntu，不管是哪种情况，保持你的系统更新最新的软件包总是需要的。

当然，始终建议通过联网来更新系统。

但有时，出于安全考虑，这是不行的。连接到互联网可能需要给你的系统进行额外的加固，以保护它们免受黑客和恶意软件的攻击。

以下的方法使用 apt-offline 来解决这些问题，并概述了在没有互联网的情况下离线更新 Ubuntu 的步骤。

准备环节


一台能连接到网络的 Ubuntu（你朋友的、咖啡馆、实验室系统）

存储了软件包的 U 盘

两个系统都安装了 apt-offline：一个系统离线，另一个系统联网


安装 apt-offline

在两个系统下安装 apt-offline。你可以使用以下命令安装：

sudo apt install apt-offline


如果你想在离线的目标系统安装 apt-offline，你可以提前下载到 U 盘里，然后复制到目标系统，再使用下面的命令安装。

Ubuntu 22.04 LTS 和其他版本的下载链接如下所示。你可以选择一个镜像并下载 deb 文件。


下载 .deb 文件 – apt-offline


sudo dpkg -i name_of_package.deb


如何更新 Ubuntu

在离线的目标系统上打开终端，使用以下命令创建一个 .sig 签名文件：

sudo apt-offline set ~/offline-data.sig




在这个刚创建的签名文件中，包含下载所需的软件包的路径和详细信息。



把签名文件复制到 U 盘中，再插到联网的 Ubuntu 系统上。

在联网的 Ubuntu 上创建一个目录（参见下面）来存放这些文件。

打开一个终端，运行以下命令来下载所需的软件包。记得根据你的系统，更改下载目录和 .sig 签名文件的路径。

apt-offline get -d ~/offline-data-dir offline-data.sig




你可以看到文件相应下载，然后复制整个下载目录到 U 盘，再插到离线的 Ubuntu 系统。

运行以下命令将下载的软件包安装到离线系统，记得根据你的系统更改目录路径。

sudo apt-offline install offline-data-dir/




如果一切顺利，你将获得一个更新完的 Ubuntu。

重复以上步骤，就可以保持你的离线 Ubuntu 为最新版本。

希望以上教程能帮到你更新离线的 Ubuntu 系统，如果你遇到任何问题，请在下面的评论框中告诉我。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[据报道，知情人士透露，从本周开始，亚马逊计划对企业和技术部门裁员1万人。这将成为该公司迄今为止规模最大的一次裁员。知情人士称，此次裁员将占亚马逊公司员工的3%左右。由于亚马逊正在内部审核各个业务的优先级，所以具体数字可能会有所变化。


知情人士表示，这家美国零售巨头计划对其设备部门（负责生产Alexa系列语音控制设备和家居安全摄像头）、人力资源和零售部门进行裁员，但目前还不清楚他们具体将在何时通知员工。知情人士将亚马逊及其他公司最近的裁员归咎于不确定的宏观经济环境。


美国科技公司经历了多年的快速招聘后，近期却因为担心经济衰退而展开了一系列裁员。就在上周，Facebook母公司Meta Platforms表示将裁员逾1.1万人，约占其员工总数的13%。


亚马逊预计，在通常利润丰厚的假日季期间，该公司的销售额增长将会有所放缓。


该公司CFO布莱恩·奥尔萨夫斯基（Brian Olsavsky）在上月的一次电话会议上表示，亚马逊发现，美国的家庭购物预算出现紧缩，他们仍将继续与高企的通胀率和能源成本做斗争。


亚马逊随后透露，他们将会在未来几个月冻结增量公司招聘。


上周有报道称，亚马逊的设备部门近年来的年度运营亏损超过50亿美元。由于部分用户只用语音助理来完成为数不多的几项任务，所以亚马逊也在考虑是否要专注于Alexa的新功能。


如果将仓库和物流员工都计算在内，截至9月30日，亚马逊的员工总数超过150万人。照此计算，此次裁员不到其员工总数的1%。

 github: github.com/sayan01/present
 Small and precise syntax: $ for banner text, # for title, ! for image, @ for links, - for list items
 the source file is compiled into a pdf which is ready to be presented with one command:
 present source.pre 
 I know this looks like latex+beamer or suckless/sent. That is because it was inspired by them, but this is (according to me) better than them for making presentations. Latex is for writing papers and is the best at it, adding a doc-class to it to make it render presentations is overkill for the job. It has too many complex syntax to learn and still to many options for styling. If the user is spending time on the style of the slides, he has forgetten why slides are made: to augment and aid their presentation, not be the spotlight. Presentations should be simple and to the point, without unnecesary animations and flairs. Sent does a very good job doing just that. The problem is sent does not compile into a pdf or any other portable format, rather creates an X window. so sent is a dependency on the system used to present the slides, which is not always possible to meet. present compiles the source code into a pdf, which is universally portable and almost all devices and OS support pdf. even browsers can render pdf. It also does not support links and image captions.
 present has very small syntax, which can be learnt in under a minute. These components, according to me, are enough for any presentation. The syntax is similar to markdown (sometimes easier than markdown). More details are there in the README of the github repository.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[英伟达采用形式验证来验证软件安全性

英伟达软件安全副总裁说，“面向测试的软件验证对安全来说根本不起作用，你可以对提供给用户的功能的质量有一个衡量标准，但对于安全问题，就没有什么作用，……很难知道你是否已经完成了。”幸运的是，有可能用数学方法证明你的代码的行为与它的规范精确一致。这个过程被称为“形式验证”。英伟达采用软件形式验证行业解决方案 SPARK 来证明软件的安全性。在几年前进行过概念验证后，现在许多英伟达产品在使用 SPARK 组件发布。


消息来源：AdaCore



老王点评：形式验证是个好方法，但是不是那么容易掌握和推行。




JavaScript、Java、Python、Kotlin 和 Rust 开发者增长惊人

根据 SlashData 去年夏天从 163 个国家的 26000 多名开发者调查统计而成的第 23 期《开发者国家报告》，JavaScript 仍然是最大的编程语言社区，全球估计有 1960 万开发者每天都在使用 JavaScript；在过去的两年里，Java 社区的规模已经从 830 万增加到 1650 万，而同期开发者只增加了 50%；Python 在过去两年中增加了约 800 万新的开发人员；Kotlin 和 Rust 社区的规模在过去两年里都翻了一番。


消息来源：ZDNet



老王点评：开发人员越来越倾向于使用主流开发工具，所以流行的越发流行，但是这样就会扼杀一些创新。




密码学家建议考虑非晶格的后量子密码算法

目前许多密码学系统的安全性是基于大数的因数分解的，但因数分解的一个怪癖使其容易受到量子计算机的攻击。因此人们对上世纪 90 年代提出的“晶格密码学”寄予厚望，美国 NIST 选择的四个后量子密码学标准有三个采用晶格密码学。RSA 算法名称中的 S，Adi Shamir 对此表示担忧，“从某种意义上说，我们是把所有鸡蛋放在同一个篮子里”。今年夏天早些时候，一个有前途的后量子密码学方案不是用量子计算机，而是用一台普通的笔记本电脑破解的。


消息来源：Slashdot



老王点评：确实如此，只有一种抗量子的密码理论，很难说会不会被发现潜在的弱点。]]></summary>

Overall, TTM (Translation-Table Maps) is a memory manager that is used to accelerate devices with dedicated memory. Basically, all the resources are grouped together by objects of buffers in different sizes. TTM then handles the lifetime, the movements and the CPU mapping of those objects (https://docs.kernel.org/gpu/drm-mm.html).
 Based on the kernel documentation, each DRM (Direct Rendering Manager) driver needs a memory manager. There are two memory managers supported by DRM: TTM and GEM (Graphics Execution Manager).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[时至今日，世界上已经有成百上千种不同的 Linux 发行版。

它们中的大多数都可以被划归为三个大类 : Debian、Red Hat（Fedora）以及 Arch Linux。

使用基于 Debian/Ubuntu、Red Hat/SUSE 或者 Arch 的 Linux 发行版自然有它们的优势。它们很受大众欢迎，因此它们的包管理器能够提供大量的软件包。

然而，有一些用户更倾向于使用从头开始构建、独立于 DEB/RPM 这类包管理系统之外的发行版。

在这篇文章当中，我们将列出一些优秀的独立 Linux 发行版。


注意 : 显然，下面的列表显然不会包括一些广受欢迎，通常作为创建新发行版的基础的发行版，如 Debian、Ubuntu 和 Fedora 等。此外，列表顺序不分先后，没有特定的排名。


1、NixOS



NixOS 最初发布于 2003 年，NixOS 建立在 Nix 包管理器之上。它每年发布两个版本，通常是在 5 月和 11 月。

NixOS 可能不是一个直接面向新用户或普通用户的发行版。然而，其独特的 包管理 方法吸引了各种用户。

此外，它仍然支持 32 位系统。

其他特性：


构建隔离的包

可靠的升级，并且具有回滚功能

可重现的系统配置



NixOS


2、Gentoo Linux



Geetoo Linux 是一个主要针对操作系统专家的独立 Linux 发行版。它是为那些希望自由定制、微调和优化操作系统以满足其要求的用户而构建。

Gentoo 使用 Portage 包管理器 来创建和安装软件包，通常还允许你针对你的硬件来优化它们。Chrome 的开源版本 Chromium OS 便是使用 Gentoo 作为其核心的。

不要忘记，Gentoo 是 仍然支持 32 位…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[以下是如何在 Ubuntu 和其他 Linux 发行版中提高笔记本和桌面的音量的方法。


你有没有觉得你的 Ubuntu 笔记本的音量太小，尽管你把音量调到了 100%？我相信你有过。主要原因是：很明显，笔记本电脑的扬声器输出强度比大型扬声器要低。

此外，Ubuntu 和其他发行版将默认的最大音量设置为 100%，也就是 0dB（分贝）。0dB 是最大音量的参考值。做个比较，如果你把音量设置为 -10dB，这意味着你的音量比最大的 0dB 安静。

VLC 和一些媒体播放器允许你将音量提高到 200%。在最新的 Ubuntu 中使用一些设置，你可以将音量进一步提高。


注意：在你尝试和使用以下方法之前，请记住，每个扬声器都有其制造商设定的硬件限制。偶尔一次，播放超过 100% 的音频是可以的。但是，连续放大到更高的分贝可能会使输出的音频失真，并且从长远来看可能会损坏你的扬声器。因此，在使用时要小心谨慎，并有所限制。


在 Ubuntu 和其他发行版中提高扬声器音量

对于最新的 Ubuntu 22.04 及以上版本（GNOME）

从应用菜单中打开“设置Settings”，进入“声音Sound”标签。

启用 “过度放大Over Amplification” 开关。在你启用的那一刻，你应该看到音量条被扩大了。



现在你可以享受音量提升来听音乐了。

Fedora、Arch Linux 和其他发行版

如果你使用带有 GNOME 的 Fedora 工作站，你将看不到上述选项，因为这是 Ubuntu 特有的设置。见下面。



因此，对于任何其他 Linux 发行版（Arch、Fedora、RedHat 等）或桌面（KDE、Xfce、LXQt 等），打开终端并安装 PulseAudio 音量控制器。

Fedora、RedHat Linux、OpenSUSE 等基于 RPM 的发行版：

sudo dnf install pavucontrol


对于 Arch Linux、Manjaro：

sudo pacman -S pavucontrol


基于 Ubuntu 的非 GNOME 发行版：

sudo apt install pavucontrol


如何使用

安装后，从应用菜单中打开 pavucontrol，它应该有个 &ldquoulseAudio Volume Control” 菜单项。



总结

记住，上述方法可以提高整个系统的扬声器音量。这意味着系统的声音和警报也会受到影响。所以，要记住这一点。正如我前面提到的，如果连续使用，提升扬声器音量超过 100% 可能会导致扬声器变形或损坏。

我希望这个教程能帮助你提高系统音量。如果你遇到问题，请在评论栏里告诉我。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Howdy! This post was my original post, but I have also posted this question in the common_lisp and emacs subreddits.
 I'm installing Gentoo, and I'm looking at either StumpWM or EXWM as a WM, and I'm leaning toward EXWM simply because Emacs. However, I'm sure there's a lot I don't know about the comparison between them. I'm wondering if you nice folks might share your insights.
 I use Emacs a lot, and plan on using it more and more as I get my config dialed in. I'm fully invested in Emacs, and consider it to be part of the OS, so I'll be using it either way. I think having more stuff in Emacs is nothing but handy.
 I will be using this setup on several PCs, including a crappy laptop, a gaming laptop, and a few desktops. Gaming is the main thing I'm worried about. I just use KDE on the gaming laptop for now.
 I'm also interested in programming, specifically in Lisp. I'm leaning more toward Common Lisp, which is what StumpWM is written in. Of course EXWM is Emacs Lisp, but that's kind of Emacs-specific and wouldn't be used for other software development. I've also considered learning scheme because I have a copy of SICP, but that's taters under the skillet.
 Finally, I'm a few months away from getting going on managing a homelab. None of the servers will run this system, but all of the management will be done through it on my main PC. I will be doing a lot of multitasking, troubleshooting, remote-management, security stuff, note-taking, etc.
 So, in a nutshell, I'm wondering: - What can StumpWM do that EXWM can't do? - What can EXWM do that StumpWM can't do? - What are the major limitations of each, specifically when compared to one another? - How will each compare when stacked against the things I want to use it for? - How does the ecosystem for each one compare? I know the Emacs ecosystem decently well, but not StumpWM's. Are there many plugins / extensions? Are there many users communicating regularly with each other?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[分享一些我最喜欢的开源写作工具。


在我的职业生涯中，我已经写过很多东西，主要是作为一名 IT 顾问，创建产品文档作为给的客户可交付成果。这些文档通常针对不同操作系统和软件产品提供说明。

自 2018 年，我开始在 www.opensource.com 上发表关于开源软件的文章。当然，我使用开源软件进行协作。接下来我将介绍我使用过的四款开源编辑器。

1、Vi

Vi 也被称为 Vim（LCTT 校注：此外不确，Vi 和 Vim 是两个软件，只是 Vim 取代了 Vi，并以 vi 的名字运行。），是我学习的第一款开源编辑器。这是我在计算机科学课程中学习的编辑器，并且我所有的 C 语言编程都是通过它完成的。自 1995 年以来，实际上我一直使用它作为命令行编辑器。这款工具有多个迭代版本，以至于我都可以为之写一系列文章了。我只想说，在我的日常使用中，我坚持使用它的基本命令行形式，并进行最小的定制。

2、LibreOffice Writer

Writer 是 LibreOffice 开源办公套件的一部分。它是由文档基金会Document Foundation维护的全功能文字处理器。它支持行业标准格式，例如开放文档格式 （ODF）、Open XML 和 MS Office DOC、DOCX。可以在其官方网站上 了解有关 Writer 的更多信息。

3、Ghostwriter

Ghostwriter 是一个用于 Markdown 的文本编辑器。它有一个很好的实时查看器和语法指南或备忘单功能。访问官方网站 了解更多内容。

4、Gedit

Gedit 是许多 Linux 发行版中的基本图形编辑器，被描述为“用于 GNOME 桌面的小型轻量级文本编辑器”。我最近开始使用它来创建 Asciidoc 格式的文章。使用 Asciidoc 的好处是语法易于管理并可导入到 Drupal 等 Web 渲染系统中。通过 Gedit Wiki 了解许多提示和技巧。

编辑文本

开源世界中有大量编辑软件。随着我继续写作，这个列表可能会增加。我的主要目标是格式简单。我希望我的文章易于在互联网平台上导入、转换和发布。

你的写作风格、功能需求和目标受众将指导你确定首选工具。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[据媒体报道，根据推特全职员工分享的内部沟通记录，大量推特合同工发现，他们在本周末突然被解雇了，因为他们已无法访问推特聊天工具 Slack 和其他工作系统。


据科技新闻网站 Platformer 报道，来自推特的消息称，推特已终止了 4400 名合同工的合同，占据总计 5500 名合同工中的 80%。此番裁员将对保持网站正常运行的内容审核和核心基础设施服务产生重大影响。


其中一些推特合同工在印度等海外地区工作。推特全职员工表示，在与他们合作的合同工被解雇之前，他们没有收到任何内部通知。据这些员工透露，推特已经解雇了所有的内部沟通团队。他们还苦笑着说，报道该公司的媒体现在充当了内部沟通的角色。


对合同工的裁员标志着这家社交媒体平台最新的瘦身举措。自从10月28日被埃隆·马斯克（Elon Musk）收购以来，该公司已经裁员大约一半。


在埃隆·马斯克10月28日收购该公司后，推特已经解雇了一半的员工，大约为3700人。


马斯克已告知剩余推特员工，他出售了价值数十亿美元的特斯拉股票，目的就是“拯救”推特。目前还不清楚马斯克是否会继续出售特斯拉股票以偿还推特的债务。


马斯克还告诉推特员工，在经济低迷的情况下，推特存在破产的可能。在马斯克与推特展开收购拉锯战时，广告商纷纷逃离或暂停在该平台上支出。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ubuntu 21.10 “Impish Indri” 及之后的版本将 Firefox Snap 设为默认浏览器。如果你不喜欢 Snap，可以通过以下方式将其删除并使用库存版本。


关于 Snap 是否是 APT 的更好替代品，一直存在争议。而许多用户更喜欢 Snap 系统，也有一些人非常讨厌它。Ubuntu 和 Canonical 认为它是 Linux 的最佳安装仓库和包管理工具之一。 Snap 被讨厌的主要原因是它的启动很慢。然而，这个论点是另一篇文章的内容。

从 Ubuntu 中删除 Firefox Snap 版本

所以，如果你还没有 听说过这件事，Ubuntu 21.10（和所有后续版本）默认提供 Firefox Snap 包。因此，当你从 Ubuntu 21.10 开始安装时，默认的左侧停靠区的快捷方式是 Firefox 的 Snap 版本。你可以使用以下各种方法对其进行验证。





如果你因为 性能 和存储问题而不喜欢 Snap，可以通过以下命令将其删除。

如果已经打开，那么关闭所有 Firefox 实例。

打开一个终端。然后运行以下命令：

sudo snap remove firefox


等待命令完成。这将从你的系统中删除它的 Snap 可执行文件，并断开 Firefox 与各种系统服务的连接。但是主目录下的 Snap 目录仍然存在。你可以使用以下命令手动删除它：

cd ~/snap
rm -r firefox


安装 Firefox 替代方法

现在，当你删除了 Firefox，你可以通过以下方式来使用此浏览器。

方法 1 – 使用 PPA（推荐）

在使用此方法之前，请确保如上删除了 Firefox 的 Snap 版本。

有一个 官方 Firefox PPA，由其开发团队维护。你可以将此 …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[SoX Sound Exchange 甚至可以为你的音频文件添加特效。




我工作需要使用音视频媒体，不管你处理哪种媒体，你肯定知道标准化是一种有价值的工具。就像你不会试图把一个分数加到一个小数上而不转换其中一个一样，我已经知道，把不同格式的媒体组合起来并不理想。为了方便用户，大多数爱好者级应用程序使转换过程不可见。然而，对于那些需要控制媒体细节的用户的灵活软件，会通常让你自己提前将媒体转换为所需的格式。我有一些最喜欢的音频转换工具，其中之一就是号称“音频的瑞士军刀” —— SoX。

安装

在 Linux 或 BSD 上，可以从软件存储库或 Ports 树中安装 sox 命令（，以及一些有用的符号链接）。

你也可以从 Sourceforge.net 上安装 SoX。它不经常发布，但它的代码库往往是稳定的，所以如果你想要最新的功能（如 Opus 支持），构建它是容易和安全的。

SoX 主要提供了 sox 命令，但是创建了一些有用的符号链接：play、rec 和 soxi。

使用 SoX 获取文件信息

SoX 可以读取和重写音频数据。它是否存储重写的音频数据取决于你。在有些情况下，你不需要存储转换后的数据，例如，当你将输出直接发送到扬声器进行回放时。然而，在进行任何转换之前，最好首先确定要处理的是什么。

使用 soxi 命令也可以收集音频文件信息。soxi 会符号链接到 soxi --info。

Agile extremists love to dance around the broken record of: “but Agile is what ‘high-performing’ development teams use”.
Is it?
According to who?
What study?
What was the sample size?
How long was the study run?
What caliber of companies were included in the study?
Most importantly, what was the percentage increase in deliverability/speed/efficiency/developer happiness/customer happiness when using agile vs without?
These are questions the agile overlords either don’t know or refuse to provide the answer to.
Even if said studies exist (hint: quality ones don’t), those studies would likely have been conducted by statisticians who have never worked on a development team, thus making their study unqualified right out of the gate.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[To promote Linux on the desktop, we need to promote companies that are pushing desktop Linux forward.
 Most traditional Linux companies (Red Hat/IBM, Canonical, SUSE) no longer care about desktop Linux.
 In my mind the following is the list of companies that still care about Linux desktop:
  
Google (Chrome OS, Chrome OS Flex, Android).
 System76 (Pop!_OS)
 Valve (SteamOS)
  
To promote desktop Linux we need to be supporting these companies by buying/using their software and hardware.
 Any other companies that I missed?

 I would love to still have hope to watch and edit movies in 4K HDR both natively and streamed on my device.

 Can someone with this mouse just test for me if there is any way to control its RGB on Linux?
 Just checking the list of supported devices from the OpenRGB software isn't a guaranteed way of knowing this, because my current mouse isnt't listed there, but I can still control its RGB with this software with no problems.

 i am looking for a good Solution to backup all my Webservers and NAS to a BackUp-Server. I prefer to Pull-Backups instead of Push them because the Webserver know the least of the BackUp-Server. If a Server gets compromised, the Hacker don't have any access to the BackUp-Server.
 What Kind of Software do you use to create and manage your BackUp-Jobs? A WebGUI with a Dashboard would be awesome to overview the Jobs and get Alerts if a BackUp failed. Is there any "Industry-Standard" for that?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm an old MS-DOS / Windows programmer used to Turbo Pascal, Delphi, etc.  The old days were simple, in that you compiled code, and gave it to your customers. Everything just works.
Now every time I try to learn something new... there's always a build system in the way, with MSTOICAL it was Autoconf, with switching to Linux, I couldn't get WikidPad to build on Linux, trying to build a lifeboat for Twitter, Python works, but then modules require builds that break.
Is it possible to have a system without Make or the like?
Alternatively, any good resources for the above?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[据QQ邮箱网站消息，目前，QQ邮箱的容量策略已经进行了调整。现阶段邮箱初始容量为2GB，最多可免费提供16G的邮箱容量，也就是翻倍3次。如果需要用到更多容量则需付费将邮箱容量和文件中转站升级至2048GB，费用为15元每月。


免费升级后的容量不会再降回去。


此前QQ邮箱每90天手动免费扩容一次，扩容后邮箱容量翻倍，而且当你容量用到50%之后也会自动翻倍。


QQ邮箱是一款腾讯在2002年推出的，向用户提供安全、稳定、快速、便捷电子邮件服务的邮箱产品，已为数亿用户提供免费和增值邮箱服务。


以下为QQ邮箱网站的“邮箱容量升级说明”。



新的容量策略为：免费提供最大可达16G的邮箱容量，可按需扩容；也可以通过付费将邮箱容量升级至2048GB；


1、邮箱初始容量为2GB，免费容量最大可达16GB；


2、我们将根据邮箱容量的使用情况自动扩容，你也可以手动升级容量，每3个月（按90天计算）可手动扩容一次；


3、免费升级后的容量不会再降回去，可放心使用；


4、若需要更大的邮箱容量，可付费升级邮箱容量至2048GB；付费到期后，邮箱容量将恢复为付费前的容量；


5、节约是种美德。我们依然推荐大家定期清理用不到的邮件。此外，我们将普通附件的大小限制也已提升到了50M。]]></summary>

也许你有一些古老的激光打印机或一体机，但是它们没有 Windows 11 驱动程序。而 Linux 在支持旧硬件方面明显更好，如果驱动程序仍然可以编译，它就不会被删除。现在你可以通过在 WSL 内运行的 OpenPrinting 中使用旧打印机进行打印。这之所以可以实现，还要感谢 WSL2 支持了 systemd，从而支持 Canonical 的 Snap 版的打印机应用。

老王点评：没想到 WSL 还有这种好处！




DeviantArt 为作品添加 AI 许可标签

著名艺术网站 DeviantArt 推出了自己的 AI 艺术生成器 DreamUp。为了让艺术家控制他们的作品，DeviantArt 让他们可以选择该工具是否可以使用他们的风格作为直接灵感。并在不允许 AI 使用的作品页面添加特定的标签。DeviantArt 也鼓励其他创作者平台采用这种方法，以确保艺术家仍然能够与在线观众分享他们的作品。


消息来源：Engadget



老王点评：确实应该形成一种行业规范，或者新的许可证惯例。




一根普通光纤传输全球互联网流量

通过将 55 种模式的信号射入单芯光纤，该团队能够以每秒 1.53 Pbps 的数据速率进行传输。1Pbps 相当于 100 万 Gbps。据估计，整个全球互联网的带宽只有不到 1Pbps，这意味着这根光纤足够处理全球所有的互联网带宽。虽然这不是最快的传输速率，之前有日本研究机构达到了 1.84 Pbps 的速率，但这个纪录的意义在于，它是使用标准覆层直径为 0.125 毫米的光纤实现的，很大程度上与现有的基础设施兼容。

老王点评：带宽扩展的太快，说不准以后个人设备也需要几个 G 的带宽了。]]></summary>

Two well known command line tools on Linux which can help with dynamic analysis are “strace” and “ltrace”. “strace” allows tracing of system calls (“man 2 syscalls”) and signals (“man 7 signal”). I am not going to focus on “strace” in this writeup, you can read more about it using “man strace”.
 On the other hand, “ltrace” allows the tracing of dynamic library calls and signals received by the traced process (“man 1 ltrace”). Moreover, it can also trace syscalls (like “strace”) if you are using the “-S” flag.
 If you have tried using “ltrace” in the new versions of Ubuntu you probably saw that the library calls are not shown (you can verify it using “ltrace `which ls`”). In order to demonstrate that I …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[本指南介绍了使用 GNOME Boxes 将虚拟机镜像移动到另一台主机所需的步骤。


GNOME Boxes 是由 GNOME 项目创建的虚拟化程序。此程序用作 libvirt 的前端。libvirt 是用于管理平台虚拟化的开源 API、守护进程和管理工具。它支持不同的虚拟化技术，如 KVM、Xen、VMware ESXi、QEMU 等。

如果你想使用 GNOME Boxes 创建虚拟机，请参阅本指南。

在本教程中，我将解释如何将任何虚拟机镜像文件（已使用 GNOME Boxes 创建并运行）移动到不同的主机并运行它。

这样，你不再需要从操作系统重新安装虚拟机。此外，它是便携式的，你可以将虚拟机镜像放在 U 盘中。

如何使用 GNOME Boxes 将虚拟机镜像移动到另一台主机

我希望你已经在 GNOME Boxes 中创建了一个虚拟机。如果没有，请查看 本指南。

GNOME Boxes 和 libvert 使用以下目录存储虚拟机镜像和配置。如下所述，你需要仔细备份每个文件。

GNOME Boxes 将虚拟机的物理镜像（通常为数 GB 大小）保存在以下路径中。对于你的每个虚拟机，你都会在其中找到一个镜像。

~/.local/share/gnome-boxes/images/




将图像文件复制到新主机的路径：~/.local/share/gnome-boxes/images/。

将 libvirt 的 XML 配置从以下路径复制到新主机的相同位置。

~/.config/libvirt/qemu/




在上述路径中，你应该会看到每个虚拟机的单独 xml 文件。复制你需要的那个。

在你当前的系统中打开以下文件。

~/.config/gnome-boxes/sources/'QEMU Session'


复制属于你的虚拟机的部分（从 [display ... 到本部分的末尾）。你可以使用名称轻松找到它（看下面的 last-seen-name）。



在另一台主机上打开相同的上述文件并将复制的内容附加到末尾。保存文件。

关闭新主机中的所有应用，包括 GNOME Boxes。

现在打开 GNOME Boxes，你应该会看到你的虚拟机和它的内容一起被移动到新主机中。

你现在可以拥有一个可以轻松携带和移动的便携式虚拟机。请记住，目标机器应该安装了 GNOME Boxes 才能完成这项工作。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Lua 是一个有趣而强大的语言，随着各个版本的推进，功能愈发的强大，开发者群体也在不断的增长。这篇文章我们将探索一下它的各种前景。


Lua 是一个脚本语言，它面向过程、函数式编程，甚至可以是 面向对象的。它使用类 C 语言的语法，但却是动态类型，具有自动内存管理和垃圾回收功能，使用基于寄存器的虚拟机来解释字节码。这些特点使得它对于初学者来说是个很好的语言，同时也是经验丰富的程序员的强大工具。

虽然与 Python 和 JavaScript 相比，Lua 现在已经有点儿黯然失色了，但是 Lua 拥有的一些优点使得它在许多的重大软件项目中很受欢迎。Lua 很容易嵌入到其他语言当中， 这意味着你可以在（例如）Java 编写的代码中包含 Lua 文件，就像原生的 Java 代码一样运行。这听起来就像魔法一般，现在有许多项目如 luaj 使得其成为可能，之所以可以实现，正是因为 Lua 就是为此而设计的。部分出于这种灵活性，你可以在许多游戏、图形应用的程序中发现 Lua 脚本的身影。

就像其他任何事情一样，做到完美是需要时间的，但 Lua 是很易于学习（并且有趣）的语言。它是一种一致的语言、一种带有有用的错误消息的友好的语言，并且可以在网上轻松找到许多有用的资料。那么就让我们开始吧！

安装 Lua

在 Linux 下，你可以使用发行版自带的包管理来安装 Lua。例如，在 Fedora、CentOS、 Mageia、OpenMandriva 以及类似发行版中：

$ sudo dnf install lua


在 Debian 以及基于 Debian 的系统中：

$ sudo apt install lua


对于 Mac，你可以使用 MacPorts 或者 Homebrew：

$ sudo port install lua

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[My girlfriend is saving up for a steam deck for Christmas and as easy as it would be for me to tell her how to install Windows 11 on it, I wanna get her into Linux, and she wants me to teach her. However I don't know how to introduce her to the whole ecosystem in a way that isn't gonna scare her off. I am thinking about setting her up with SDF account to introduce her into the shell and unix-like commands but if anyone has any other suggestions let me know. She takes well to videos, more so than just reading so hope that helps.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So I don't know is this the sub i should write, and I hope the flair is the right one. I am a first-year student in math and computer science at a uni. I am using Linux for 6 years or something like that and haven't even touched the windows for 2 years. I have above average knowledge about Linux, at least I think so.
 Last week, the manager of computer lab and teacher said there is students that gives courses in the lab, there are courses like python, web development, unity and I would like you to give Linux course. And I said why not. Now I don't know what to do. How should I proceed and what I am going to teach for 1 year (1 hour/week). I looked up to some playlists on YouTube like "Linux for Beginners" and they are teaching a little bit about terminal usage. But I will teach to volunteers and noobs. I should get their attention. How can I get their attention and make a Windows user thinking about giving a try to GNU/Linux. I want to show people that you can use GNU/Linux as a casual user. Linux is not scary and hard. The advantages of open source. And then the terminal usage. Now there is the other question, I learn Linux, okay, but why I should learn the terminal usage, how the OS works and some technical things. I can just use GUI. You get me, I hope. Then what should be the curriculum be? 
 I wanted to get your opinions. Thanks for responses. And sorry, English is not my first language.

files; the stream of commits in a Git repository
reflects the change history of those files.  What is seen in Git, though, is the
final form of those commits; the changes that the patches themselves went
through on their way toward acceptance are not shown there.  That history
can have value, especially while changes are still under consideration.
The proposed git
evolve subcommand is a recognition that changes themselves go
through changes and that this process might benefit from tooling support.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[11月12日零时，第14届天猫双11收官。天猫表示，今年天猫双11稳中向好，交易规模与去年持平，但天猫方面未透露具体GMV（成交总额）。据悉，2021年11月12日，天猫发布双11战报，截至2021年11月12日零点，总交易额为5403亿元。今年也是阿里历史上首次未公布成交总额数字。


京东同样未公布今年双11的GMV，去年京东累计下单金额超3491亿元。


“京东黑板报”微信公号发布的信息显示，截至11月11日晚23时59分，京东超越行业增速，创造了新的纪录，与此同时，零售购物用户数也再创佳绩，但具体是怎样的增速，新增了多少用户，京东方面并未进一步披露。


这一决定早有迹象，在11月11日下午举行的媒体沟通会上，天猫方面开场就主动提到了变化：过去的GMV大屏幕不见了，屏幕上取而代之的是今年最重要的数字：1，今年天猫双十一要“多做一点”，呈现更多暖意、善意、绿意。


淘宝直播在今年双11前夕迎来了新的发展，罗永浩、遥望科技入淘，出现了大量中腰部商家，过亿直播间比去年翻了一番。杨光也对外披露了直播交易额的增长情况，截至11月10日，新主播预售引导成交同比增长近684%，腰部主播预售引导成交同比增长365％、直播机构预售引导成交同比增长165%。


今年年中，新冠疫情复发导致的供应链中断与消费信心疲软，对消费市场产生冲击。作为新消费品牌的代表，三顿半创始人吴骏表示，今年品牌一个很重要的变化是，从从新消费到价值消费。


过去，新是品牌的增长利器。“但新是有保鲜期的，并非能一直持续。当滤镜退去后，消费变得理性客观，现在用户拿着放大镜消费，关注价格这些客观标准的动作。”吴骏强调，当流量的红利逐渐消退，品牌也要提高自身价值，滤镜消费过去后，要从产品交付的全流程、全触点关注用户体验，才能赢得用户肯定。

I am going to talk about “SafeSetID”. By the way, if you want to read the writeup about LSM you can use the following link — https://medium.com/@boutnaru/linux-security-lsm-linux-security-modules-907bbcf8c8b4.
 Overall “SafeSetID” is an LSM that was merged in kernel 5.1. The goal of “SafeSetID” is to restrict the transitions to target UID/GID from current UID/GID based on a system wide whitelist. Thus, it governs the family of syscalls which allows those types of transitions (like seteuid and setegid. In general set*uid/set*gid).
 One of the most used use-cases for “SafeSetID” is to enable a non-root application to transition to other untrusted UIDs/GIDs with…]]></summary>

据报道，Chrome、Safari、Firefox 和其他浏览器都接受一家名为 TrustCor 的根证书机构（CA）。CA 是互联网基础设施的基石，它签署的 SSL 证书可以保证网站不是假的，流量是加密的。因而，CA 可以签发“伪造”证书从而劫持加密流量。此外，该公司在巴拿马的注册记录显示，其信息与今年被确认的一家的间谍软件制造商相同，文件显示，该公司十多年来一直向美国政府机构出售通信拦截服务。Mozilla 表示它可能会取消 TrustCor 的根证书。


消息来源：华盛顿邮报



老王点评：谷歌当年就因为有根 CA 滥用而取消过该根 CA 证书，看看这次谷歌会如何？




GitHub 实验 “Hey, GitHub!” 语音编程

GitHub Next 团队宣布了一项新的实验：“Hey, GitHub!”，允许与 Copilot 进行语音互动。也就是说，你甚至不需要使用键盘就可以让 VSCode 为你提供编程建议。GitHub 称，该实验可以识别“自然语言”。除了编写和编辑代码，它还允许程序员进行代码导航和执行其它 VSCode 命令。

老王点评：连键盘都不用了，直接讲你要干啥就好了。




美国国家安全局敦促各组织转向内存安全编程语言

美国国家安全局（NSA）表示，建议各组织通过利用 C#、Go、Java、Ruby 或 Swift 等语言内存安全编程语言进行战略性转变。NSA 表示“内存管理问题已经被利用了几十年，今天仍然很常见。”软件内存安全问题是约 70% 的漏洞背后的原因。不良的内存管理也会导致技术问题，如不正确的程序结果，随着时间的推移程序性能的下降，以及程序崩溃。

老王点评：建议是好的，但是 NSA 不太值得信任。]]></summary>

That worked like a charm for years, until one day, the signal guys changed something in there backend, so my signal-cli couldn't connect anymore. (Fixed in more recent signal-cli versions, I believe)
 Also, I thought, signal-cli comes as a heavy java application, which takes like 10 seconds or more to even send the message, on a raspberry 1. So why not change it to good old email!? Fast, not hacky, made for it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[VLC 媒体播放器是 最好的媒体播放器 之一。这款跨平台播放器功能丰富，可以播放任何可用的媒体格式。

你会惊讶地发现 VLC 不仅仅是一个视频播放器。它可以对你的媒体文件做很多事情。

我们分享过 使用 VLC 下载 YouTube 视频 的 VLC 技巧。

让我再和你分享一个。用 VLC 裁剪视频怎么样？这不是 裁剪视频 的最佳方式，但它可以作为一个选择使用。

使用 VLC 裁剪视频

在 VLC 中裁剪视频本质上意味着从所需部分的开头到结尾录制视频。默认情况下，录制控制工具通常在 VLC 面板中不可见。

让我详细介绍一下步骤。

步骤 1：启用高级控件

要获取控件，你需要使其在主控制面板上可见。

首先选择“视图View”选项，然后选中“高级控件Advanced Controls”复选框。现在，如截图所示，出现了带有几个按钮的新控件行。



步骤 2：打开视频

为了裁剪视频，你需要在 VLC 中打开它。你可以通过“媒体Media > 打开文件Open File”在 VLC 播放器中打开视频：



或者你可以使用 Nautilus 文件管理器中的 VLC 打开视频文件：



步骤 3：使用 VLC 的录制功能裁剪视频

打开视频文件后，将时间线设置为所需输出的起点并暂停视频。之后，按“录制”按钮并播放视频。



当达到所需输出的终点时，暂停视频并再次按下“录制”按钮停止录制。



这应该将裁剪后的输出保存到你的 ~/Videos 目录中。



故障排除：无法识别的输出文件

VLC 以 .ts 文件格式录制视频。这在 VLC 中受支持，你可以根据需要使用它。但是 Ubuntu 中的许多其他播放器，包括本地视频播放器，都无法识别该格式。因此，在这种情况下，有两种解决方案。

Gnome-Video 提示安装 GStreamer 包

当你尝试打开文件时，GNOME-Videos 会提示错误并建议安装 Gstreamer 多媒体编解码器。



你可以点击上图所示的 “在 Ubuntu 软件应用中查找Find in Ubuntu Software” 按钮，这将打开 Ubuntu 软件中心。你可以在那里安装所需的编解码器包。



同样安装 Gnome-videos 并使用它打开视频将解决问题。

使用 VLC 转换视频文件

如果你不想为此安装任何额外的软件包，你可以使用 VLC 本身将 .ts 文件转换为 mp4 格式以在任何其他播放器中播放。

为此，打开 VLC 并在“媒体Media”菜单下选择“转换/保存Conver/Save”选项。



现在，使用“添加Add”按钮提供需要转换的文件的位置，然后选择“转换/保存Conver/Save”，如截图所示。



选择所需的输出配置（MP4）并为输出设置文件名，然后按“开始Start”。



这将开始转换，并根据源的时长决定转换时间。完成后，你可以从 ~/Videos 目录访问转换后的输出。



总结

虽然确实可以使用 VLC 播放器来裁剪视频，但整个过程与专门的 视频编辑器 完全不同。

最大的问题是你需要观看所有裁剪部分才能完成裁剪，如果你要裁剪跨越数分钟的视频的一大部分，这就不方便了。

无论如何，这个很酷的功能在某些情况下可能是一个方便的工具，比如你想要的只是裁剪一个特定的小剪辑或从电影场景中制作一个 Gif。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[在这篇文章中，我们会介绍迄今为止所有 Ubuntu 发行版本的吉祥物。


你可能已经注意到了：每个 Ubuntu 版本都会有一个版本名称和代号。代号由两个单词组成，这两个单词有相同的首字母，第一个单词是形容词，另一个单词通常是一个濒危的物种名称。

对应于其代号，这些 Ubuntu 版本也有一个吉祥物。例如，Ubuntu 22.04 的代号为 “Jammy Jellyfish”，因此 Ubuntu 22.04 的桌面壁纸上有 吉祥物：水母 的图像。

但是实际上，这些“吉祥物”并不总是 Ubuntu 版本的一部分，因为吉祥物在早期的 Ubuntu 版本中是没有的。

有史以来第一个 Ubuntu 版本是在 2004 年 10 月发布的 4.10 版（LCTT 译注：Ubuntu 的版本号是由年份和月份的组合来表示的。）但是，直到 Ubuntu 8.04 LTS “Hardy Heron” 版本，你才会看到相关的吉祥物。

在我之前写的 另一篇文章 中，我整理了所有 Ubuntu 版本的默认壁纸。在本文中，你将了解到所有 Ubuntu 版本的吉祥物。

现在，就让我们按时间倒序，一起进入 Ubuntu 的吉祥物之旅吧。

（LCTT 校注：本文原文发表时，Ubuntu 22.10 尚未发布，它的代号是 “Kinetic Kudu”，吉祥物是“捻角羚”。）

（LCTT 校注：由于 Ubuntu 系列的代号和吉祥物选择的都是比较少见的动物和晦涩的描述，因此尽管译者和校对虽然尽力了，但是应该还有谬误。我觉得原文作者为了找出这些说明也尽力，恐怕真正权威的诠释只有 Canonical 才能给出吧。）

Ubuntu 22.04 Jammy Jellyfish（幸运水母）

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all,
We're Fabienne and Ewan of Climacrux. Today we're proud to launch our latest project to try and make carbon dioxide removal as accessible as possible: CDR Platform [1].
In short: it’s an API to connect to a portfolio of carbon removers. You can purchase from as low as a single gram and select from both natural and technological removal methods.
Longer: A couple of years ago we launched an alternative to carbon credits, Carbon Removed[2], designed for individuals to buy and subscribe to CDR. But we always had the nagging thought that there was more that could be done.
CDR Platform is our foundation for that - a simple API to get prices and purchase (at the moment). Our plan is to become the Stripe of the carbon removal ecosystem, seamlessly connecting the supply to the demand.
We’d love to hear your feedback. Do you see a use case for this and would you use it? What features have we missed? Do you understand what we’re doing and if not, what’s unclear? We’d love to hear from you.[3]
Many thanks and happy hacking, Climacrux.
P.s. If you are a carbon remover, send us your prices, life cycle analysis and some more information about your removal timeline. Our aim is to bring your services to a wider audience so you can focus on reducing our CO₂ levels. Thanks for your work!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Today I'm launching Postcard!
I started Postcard when I deleted most social media, but still wanted a way to keep in touch with friends and my network.
When I worked at Webflow, it became clear to me that most website builders are way too complex for individual users. So, I drew inspiration from social media - where all you need is a couple photos and text fields to get a great site online. So, I think I’ve about achieved a site builder that even my Mom could use.
The product seems simple, but there are many under-the-hood optimizations. There's caching, CDNs, custom domain support, TLS certificate issuance + management, dynamically-generated open graph images, image optimizations, email sending, full-text RSS feed, email reputations, and more. It also uses a couple new products to make the domain connection process easy.
Let me know if you have any feedback or questions!
PS - Rumor is that Twitter is shutting down Revue. If you want help transferring content and subscribers over to Postcard, just email me!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I used to be a plasma user, configuring and tweaking KDE, that was fun. I switched to cinnamon because I was getting tired of when my distro breaks either by user error or drivers not installing correctly, Nvidia. I heard after that, Latte was no longer in development. That crushed me as I loved Latte on Plasma. I've seen some posts involving plasma and was wanting to go back, but the lack of latte made it difficult.
 TL;DR Does Latte have an alt that I can replace latte with, or did someone else take over the project?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[这个由 KDE 开发的功能丰富的文本编辑器正在变得更好和更有用！




Kate 文本编辑器 是一个不断发展和强大的开源文本编辑器，它可以作为微软的 Visual Studio Code 应用程序的替代品。

它可以在 Linux、Windows 和 macOS 上使用。

这个代码编辑器在 2021 年进行了重大升级，这可能使它成为了 KDE 对微软产品的回应。

在即将到来的 Kate 和 KWrite 22.12 版本上，他们的目标是添加许多非常有用的功能。

来简单看看我们可以从 Kate 中期待什么。

🆕 Kate Editor 的新增功能

如果你读了 Nate 的博客 了解 KDE 的改进，你可能已经知道了 KDE Plasma 和应用程序即将获得的升级。

但是，我想强调一些 Kate 22.12 将会带来的令人激动的新功能：


对 Qt 部件的支持

更新的欢迎页面

Git 差异查看器

配置标签页

剪切板历史


欢迎页面



和许多其他 KDE 应用程序 一样，Kate 现在将显示一个欢迎页面，该页面将欢迎用户并显示创建或打开文件、启动新会话、查看最近的文档等选项。

对于不喜欢这个页面的用户，欢迎页面上将提供一个选项，以在新窗口上禁用欢迎页面。

Git 差异查看器



Kate 终于增加了对显示 git-diff 的支持；用户将能够比较他们的代码以检查差异，并找到那些令人讨厌的、会导致他们的应用程序无法正常运行错误。

用户也可以从多种视图中进行选择，例如统一视图、并排视图和原始视图。

新的剪贴板历史粘贴对话框



Kate 现在添加了一个新的对话框，在粘贴的时候显示用户剪贴板内容的列表。

当你在多行代码之间切换，而又不想丢失重要的内容时，这可能会很有用。

配置标签页



Kate 也将添加一个配置标签页，让用户可以更改重要的设置，并添加了一个搜索栏，使用户可以快速查找特定的设置。

🛠️ 其他变更和改进

Kate 22.12 将带来的其他值得注意的改进包括：


优化的状态栏

对构建插件的改进

可移动的侧边栏按钮

对窗口处理的改进


Kate 正在成为微软的 Visual Studio Code 的合适替代品，并且自 2021 年大规模重构以来已经取得了很大的进步。

在 Kate 的 官方博客文章 中，你可以了解更多关于这些变化的信息，并看看它们实际是怎么工作的。

💬 你期待 Kate 22.12 的发布吗？还是更喜欢 VS Code？

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After talking about LSM (“Linux Security Modules”) it is time to show different technologies which leverage them. I am going to start with LoadPin. By the way, if you want to read the writeup about LSM you can use the following link — https://medium.com/@boutnaru/linux-security-lsm-linux-security-modules-907bbcf8c8b4.
 The goal of LoadPin is to ensure that all the files the kernel can load/execute reside on the same filesystem. The idea is that the filesystem would be based on a read-only device (for example think about a DVD/CD-ROM/any other RO hardware device, it could be also software based (but it has its own drawbacks). You can go over the code of LoadPin in the following link — https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/latest/source/security/loadpin/loadpin.c.
 Among the kernel files artifacts are: kernel modules, firmware, security policies and kexec images (kexec is a syscall which enables loading and booting to a different kernel from the current running one — more on that in a future writeup).
 The way it is done is by trapping the kernel’s file reading interface and basically pinning (it for kernel code loading) to the first file system which is used. Thus, any file that is part of a different filesystem will be rejected — As you can see in the screenshot below.
 One of the use-cases for using LoadPin is to ensure the integrity of kernel code (such as *.ko file) without signing them (I will detail kernel module signing in a different writeup). It is important to note that I am not recommending using/not using LoadPin, my goal is to explain about it (and leave to the reader what to do with it ;-).
 In order to enable LoadPin (which is supported since kernel 4.7) we need to set CONFIG_SECURITY_LOADPIN before building the kernel. If it is enabled we can also toggle it using the kernel command line (“loadpin.enforce=0” or “loadpin.enforce=1”).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[11月10日凌晨，苹果正式向iPhone用户推送了iOS和iPadOS 16.1.1更新（内部版本号：20B101），距离上次发布更新间隔了16天。


这次并没有新功能的加入，只有一些小漏洞的修复，不过额外为国行用户带来了专属功能。


在最新的 iOS 16.2 (20C5043e) 测试版和 iOS 16.1.1 更中，移除了“对所有人 AirDrop”选项，目前仅国行机型有此调整。





也就是说，现在你只能在“关闭 / 仅联系人 / 对所有人开放 10 分钟”三个选项中进行选择。实测需要手动开启“对所有人开放 10 分钟”，开启一次最多只会维持10分钟，随后便会自动关闭，而默认情况下均为“仅联系人能够 AirDrop”，避免在公众场所接收到第三方发送的信息。

罗马法院已经确认，Cloudflare 必须通过其公共的 1.1.1.1 DNS 解析器阻止三个 BT 网站。Cloudflare 并不反对阻止针对其客户网站的请求，但认为干扰其 DNS 解析器是有问题的，因为这些措施不容易在地理上加以限制，将影响封锁该政府管辖范围以外的终端用户。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This feature has been a part of Microsoft Windows for ages.
 I am genuinely curious as to why we have such a feature disparity on something that ought to be essential, especially given how easily somebody or an update can bork an installation..
 I just finished setting up Snapper with btrfs-grub. It is okay. But, honestly, this is another reason I really wish we'd stop pushing desktop to gamers.
 This software is far from ready for mass markets like gaming.
 It takes hours of learning/typing commands and testing these 3rd party projects just to be sure they work. The worst part is always it might get broken on some update.
 ​
 I do however appreciate all the work going into projects like snapper and btrfs-grub. But, it is hardly smooth. Grub still doesn't update automatically when new snapshots are made. Looks like the btrfs-grub git hasn't been updated in about a year which is a shame. This is a feature I've been hoping would come around.
 ​
 Basic features like this missing, I wonder why there is little to no focus on them. Instead we keep adding desktops and more distros. 
 ​
 I know where my money would be spent if I won the lottery.
 I'd invest millions in these sorts of features.
 Any similar features you wish were just there with linux desktops?

 Any time I've been addicted to something in the past, I've found that completely removing the possibility of doing it works the best.
 Is there some way to completely block games from running on my system? I of course want superuser privileges on my own computer, but if there was a way to change permissions on some important file needed for Steam and give the password to change permission to a friend, that would be sweet.
 Or could I sudo rm -rf some directory that has binaries needed to run it? I feel like there's got to be a way. Just uninstalling the game doesn't work since it reinstalls super easily.

 I was looking at some metrics and Linux's marketshare on the desktop grew from 0.8% in November 2012 to 2.7% in November 2022. That's a 3x increase in the span of a decade. Windows is down 15.64% and macOS is went up by 7.78%. There is also "Unknown", which has historically varied between 3% and 6% and must contain a majority of Windows users (considering how close it follows Windows' ups and downs), plus some Mac and Linux users who are using browsers and extentions to prevent tracking. With that in mind, Linux could be at 3%.
 I thought it would be cool to share this info.
 For anyone interested in the methodology they use, here's an FAQ: https://gs.statcounter.com/faq#methodology

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[使用 Lua 配置持久化应用设置。


不是所有的应用都需要配置文件；对很多应用来说，在启动时变得焕然一新对它们更有利。例如，简单的工具就极少需要偏好项和设置在使用过程中保持稳定不变。然而，当你编写一个复杂的应用程序时，如果能让用户设置与应用的交互方式，以及应用与系统交互的方式会很不错。这就是配置文件用来做的事情。本文将讨论一些利用 Lua 进行持久化配置的方法。

选择一种格式

关于配置文件很重要的两点是一致性和可预见性。你不会希望为了保存用户偏好项，将信息转储到文件中，然后再花几天去编码实现“逆向工程”，处理最后出现在文件里的随机信息。

这里用一些常用的 配置文件格式。Lua 有一些库可以处理大多数常用的配置格式；在本文中，我会采用 INI 格式。

安装库

Lua 库的核心仓库是 Luarocks.org。你可以在这个网站搜索库，或者你可以安装并使用 luarocks 终端命令。

Linux 环境中，你可以从发行版的软件仓库中下载它，例如：

$ sudo dnf install luarocks


在 macOS 上，请使用 MacPorts 或者 Homebrew。在 Windows 上，请使用 Chocolatey。

luarocks 安装后，你可以使用 search 子命令来搜索一个恰当的库。如果你不知道库的名字，可以通过关键词来搜索这个库，例如 ini、xml或者json，这取决于你想要用这个库做什么。打个比方，你可以搜索inifile`， 这个库被我用来解析 INI 格式的文本文件。

$ luarocks search inifile
Search results:
inifile

你是否正在寻找一种将文件从 Windows 计算机快速传输到 Linux 计算机并再次传输回来的方法？开源的 PSCP 程序可以轻松传输文件和文件夹，当然它是开源的。

在 Windows 中设置 PATH

了解如何在 Windows 中设置命令路径可以更轻松地使用 PSCP 等方便的程序。如果你不熟悉该过程，请阅读 如何在 Windows 上设置 PATH。

使用 PSCP

PSCP（PuTTY 安全复制协议）是一个命令行工具，用于将文件和文件夹从 Windows 计算机传输到 Linux 计算机。


从 网站 下载 pscp.exe。

将 pscp.exe 移动到 PATH 中的文件夹（例如，如果你按照 Opensource.com 上的 PATH 教程进行操作，则为 Desktop\App）。如果你没有设置 PATH 变量，你也可以将 pscp.exe 移动到保存要传输的文件的文件夹中。

使用 Windows 任务栏中的搜索栏在 Windows 计算机上打开 Powershell（在搜索栏中输入 powershell。）

输入 pscp -version 以确认你的计算机可以找到该命令。


IP 地址

在进行传输之前，你必须知道目标计算机的 IP 地址或完全限定域名。假设它是同一网络上的计算机，并且你没有运行 DNS 服务器来解析计算机名称，你可以在 Linux 机器上使用 ip 命令找到目标 IP 地址：

[linux]$ ip addr show |grep 'inet '
inet 127.0.0.1/8 scope host lo
inet 192.168.1.23/24 brd 10.0.1.255 sc…]]></summary>

 1) Install the Redirector extension: https://addons.mozilla.org/en-GB/firefox/addon/redirector/
 2) Click the Redirector extension: https://i.imgur.com/GcvmP5Z.png
 3) Click "Edit Redirects": https://i.imgur.com/0iu0O4q.png
 4) Click "Create new redirect": https://i.imgur.com/AixuQyW.png
 5) Set the following redirect Settings (Comments in [brackets]) https://i.imgur.com/TNBJUiS.png
 Description: Whatever you Want [e.g. Youtube to Youtube] Example URL: Any Youtube "watch?v=" link of your choice [e.g. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTrFAY3LUNw] Include Pattern: https:\/\/www\.youtube\.com\/watch\?v=(.+) [The backspaces are important, this is Regex] Redirect to: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=$1 [Note no backspaces here, this too is important] Pattern Type: Regular Expression Click "Show Advanced Options" > Exclude Pattern: ((https:\/\/www\.youtube\.com\/watch\?v=(.+)&(?=.*list.+)).+) 
 Now you can click recommended sidebar links without the AJAX loading screwing up everything.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[At the end of our earlier article on John
Ousterhout's talk at Netdev 0x16, he had concluded
that TCP was unsuitable for data-center environments for a variety of
reasons.  He also argued that there was no way to repair TCP so that it
could serve the needs of data-center networking.  In order for software to
be able 
to use the full potential of today's networking hardware, TCP needs to be
replaced with a protocol that is different in almost every way, he said.
The second 
half of the talk covered the Homa
transport protocol that he and others at Stanford have been working on
as a possible replacement for TCP in the data center.]]></summary>

Metlo works by discovering all your API endpoints, running security tests, and detecting potential attacks. It runs before your APIs go into production, and also in real time, alerting your security team when anomalous usage patterns are detected.  Metlo secures your APIs against the OWASP Top 10 (broken auth, injection, excessive data exposure etc.) and more.
Although APIs are one of the largest attack surfaces in companies today, there aren’t many good security tools to protect them. The few tools currently on the market are “enterprise” only; they require you to talk to a salesperson to use, or even see, the product.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[罗马数字是欧洲在阿拉伯数字传入之前使用的一种数码，现在应用较少。它的产生晚于中国甲骨文中的数码，更晚于埃及人的十进制数字。


罗马数字是阿拉伯数字传入之前使用的一种数码。其采用七个罗马字母作数字、即I（1）、X（10）、C（100）、M（1000）、V（5）、L（50）、D（500）。罗马数字的记数方法是：相同的数字连写，所表示的数等于这些数字相加得到的数；小的数字在大的数字的右边，所表示的数等于这些数字相加得到的数；小的数字在大的数字的左边，所表示的数等于大数减小数得到的数。


在程序设计的时候，有时候会出现使用正则表达式匹配罗马数字的问题，这里给一下解决方案：


未经验证的罗马数字：


^[MDCLXVI]+$


严格验证罗马数字：


^(?=[MDCLXVI])M*(C[MD]|D?C{0,3})(X[CL]|L?X{0,3})(I[XV]|V?I{ 0,3})$


灵活验证罗马数字：


^(?=[MDCLXVI])M*(C[MD]|D?C*)(X[CL]|L?X*)(I[XV]|V?I*)$


简单的罗马数字：


^(?=[MDCLXVI])M*D?C{0,4}L?X{0,4}V?I{0,4}$


以上正则表达式适用的编程语言： .NET、Java、JavaScript、PCRE、Perl、Python、Ruby]]></summary>

微软提交了一个一百多行的补丁，使 Linux 内核可以在嵌套的微软虚拟化管理程序（MSHV）下运行，即可以在 Hyper-V 虚拟机中运行 Hyper-V 虚拟机。


消息来源：Phoronix

能打败顶尖的围棋 AI 却会输给业余选手

自从 AlphaGo 使用神经网络而通过自我对弈精通围棋后，人类就一败涂地了。研究人员创建了一个对抗性的围棋程序，使用一些超乎常规的下法训练，它在与业余棋手的对弈中败北，但是却可以打败一个顶尖的开源围棋 AI KataGo。KataGo 使用数百万次自我对弈学习围棋，但这仍然不足以覆盖所有可能的情况，留下了可利用的漏洞。研究显示，达到人类水平的 AI 往往会犯一些非常奇怪的错误，以让人类感到惊讶的方式失败。


消息来源：Ars Technica



老王点评：不按套路出牌，连 AI 都受不了。




Linux 内核中出现一个丑陋的“黑科技”

安全研究人员在 Linux 主线内核中发现了一个已经存在三年的“黑科技”：Linux 内核会识别以 “X” 字母开始的进程，并返回“不支持原子模式设置”的错误。这个丑陋的“黑科技”是为了解决旧版本的 X.Org 服务器中的一个错误。但由于没有人愿意再维护 X11，于是这个补丁的提交者觉得，与其修复有问题的代码，不如调整内核以绕开。但事实上这只是检查第一个字母是否是 “X”，扩大了打击面，因为不是所有以 “X” 开头的进程都是 X.Org 的进程。


消息来源：Phoronix



老王点评：这样丑陋的代码显然会被 Linus 破口大骂的，不知道怎么悄悄潜入到内核当中的。]]></summary>

 After a break of 8 years, my wife wants to enter into the IT workforce again. She has 1-2 years experience as a Java developer. She would like to start with Linux certification as a first step to get back into the IT. 
 We feel it is better to work towards a basic (first) Linux certification so that there is some target to reach and set path to follow. 
 Can you please suggest what is the Linux certification she can do as an absolute beginner? Also, some structured training material tips would be of great help.

There are a bunch of different distros that can be installed on the Raspberry Pis, most have a desktop, a couple server ones have just a TUI. But it seems like there's only ubuntu server out there for RISC-V boards. I was hoping for some simple distro with a lightweight desktop like AntiX or LXLE but can't find anything. Do they just not exist?

It was mainly designed to allow implementation of MAC (Mandatory Access Control) with minimal changes to the Linux kernel.

 Despite the name containing “Modules” it is not implemented as loadable kernel modules (“.ko” files). The LSM framework is of course optional and needs to be enabled by the CONFIG_SECURITY variable.

最近我写了一个使用 Groovy 脚本来清理我的音乐文件中的标签的系列。我开发了一个 框架，可以识别我的音乐目录的结构，并使用它来遍历音乐文件。在该系列的最后一篇文章中，我从框架中分离出一个实用类，我的脚本可以用它来处理文件。

这个独立的框架让我想起了很多 awk 的工作方式。对于那些不熟悉 awk 的人来说，你学习下这本电子书：


《awk 实用指南》


我从 1984 年开始大量使用 awk，当时我们的小公司买了第一台“真正的”计算机，它运行的是 System V Unix。对我来说，awk 是非常完美的：它有关联内存associative memory——将数组视为由字符串而不是数字来索引的。它内置了正则表达式，似乎专为处理数据而生，尤其是在处理数据列时，而且结构紧凑，易于学习。最后，它非常适合在 Unix 工作流使用，从标准输入或文件中读取数据并写入到输出，数据不需要经过其他的转换就出现在了输入流中。

说 awk 是我日常计算工具箱中的一个重要部分一点也不为过。然而，在我使用 awk 的过程中，有几件事让我感到不满意。

可能主要的问题是 awk 善于处理以分隔字段呈现的数据，但很奇怪它不善于处理 CSV 文件，因为 CSV 文件的字段被引号包围时可以嵌入逗号分隔符。另外，自 awk 发明以来，正则表达式已经有了很大的发展，我们需要记住两套正则表达式的语法规则，而这并不利于编写无 bug 的代码。一套这样的规则已经很糟糕了。

由于 awk 是一门简洁的语言，因此它缺少很多我认为有用的东西，比如更丰富的基础类型、结构体、switch 语句等等。

相比之下，Groovy 拥有这些能力：可以使用 OpenCSV 库，它很擅长处理 CSV 文件、Java 正则表达式和强大的…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[打算为你的项目开发工作安装 Python 3.11？下面是如何在 Ubuntu 等发行版中安装 Python 3.11 的方法。




Python 3.11 于 2022 年 10 月 25 日发布，并声称比之前的 Python 3.10 版本快 10% - 60%。

一如既往，3.11 中的功能和改进列表明显较多。下面是一个简介：


错误回溯更明确，可以指出导致错误的确切语句。

引入异常组和新的 except* 语法。

你可以在基础表达式中添加自定义文本，以便在你的代码中更好地处理错误。

引入 Variadic 泛型，允许在 Python 数值库（如 NumPy）中使用类似数组的结构。

字典类型 TypedDict 得到了改进，现在你可以指定个别字典项目是必须的还是可选的。

引入了 Self 注解，允许类返回它们自己的类型实例。


还有很多，你可以在官方的 3.11 亮点页面 上详细了解。

Linux 发行版中的当前 Python 版本

Ubuntu 22.04 LTS 带有 Python 3.10，而最近发布的 Ubuntu 22.10 Kinetic Kudu 也是同样的版本。然而， Kinetick Kudu 可能会在几周内采用 3.11。

另外，Fedora 37 已经有了 Python 3.11 RC2，并将提供该版本。

所以，如果你正在运行 Ubuntu 22.04 LTS、Linux Mint 21 或任何基于 Ubuntu-LTS 的发行版，这里是你如何通过 PPA 安装 Python 3.11 的方法。

注意：谨慎地使用这个方法。确保你知道你在做什么，因为替换 Linux 发行版的基础 Python 版本可能会导致系统不稳定。许多默认的应用程序和软件包都依赖于 3.10 版本。

Cody, Reshma, and Rahul here and we’re building Medplum (https://www.medplum.com), an open-source platform that lets you quickly build complex healthcare applications. We provide a headless EHR (electronic health record) that supports common standards like FHIR, HL7 and more. You build whatever UI and UX you want, and we handle the infrastructure and give you lots of interoperability and automation tools.
The digital healthcare space has been hampered by proprietary tech, walled gardens, and vendor lock-in. Working as healthcare app developers ourselves, we kept seeing organizations developing the same infrastructure over and over. The question “how is this stuff not open source?” came up so often that we finally decided to just build it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Has anyone had any success installing the amdgpu (closed source) driver when using a "mainline" kernel (6.0) as opposed to the stable kernel that ships with Ubuntu (5.19)?
 I installed the amdgpu-install package from the PPA, and running sudo amdgpu-install --usecase="hip" was successful in grabbing all the dependencies (unlike with the deb you can download directly from the AMD website), but when it came to building amdgpu-dkms I was told that my kernel--6.0.7--wasn't supported.
 I'm fine downgrading back to 6.0, but given all the improvements recently released to the open source driver that's directly in the kernel, I don't want to go back any further.
 Is there any way to get access to Blender GPU rendering, the AMF encoder and OpenCL support on Linux while also using the latest kernel (and thus open source driver) for everything else?
 I'm using a highly stripped down Ubuntu 22.04 as a base, and I'm absolutely open to distro-hopping if this is trivial to do in, say, Arch.

I really like the idea of going through every little step during installation and have everything just how I want it to be. But I do not like to idea of always have the "latest and greatest" versions of my applications. 
 I want to have a stable system as a daily driver where I do not have to struggle with os issues every day.
 Am I missing something? What's the main advantage of rolling releases for a daily driver?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[... unless we do something about our governments. 
 Let's be honest. What's holding free (as in freedom) operating systems so far behind? Are they worse? I don't think so. They might have a bit less hardware support - but most people wouldn't care. They might have a bit less software available (although debatable) - but most people wouldn't care, if it's pinta or paint.net.
 I think, although leaving a room for being mistaken, that the reason for today's Windows popularity is the fact that it's shipped in damn every single laptop (with a few exceptions in a few first world countries). People don't bother to care what their laptop is running on - and it's fair, after all, not everyone is a geek or should be.
 What I suggest, is to force laptop and desktop manufacturers to provide an option with a free OS. It doesn't have to be linux-based, as there's a couple of free non-linux OS. However, the price for this laptop should be lower by the price of Windows license, to ensure actually fair competition. If Microsoft has set a price for Windows, let people choose to pay or not for it.
 Again, free as in freedom, not as in unpaid. Although I don't know right now how to ensure that manufacturers don't exploit it (by installing some CandyCrushOS as an option to force people back into Windows ), but I do believe there's a solution.
 I think the actual outcome here will be that instead of single Windows, people will be running all kinds of operating systems, be that gnu/linux, other linux, or gnu/non-linux, or BSD, or many many more! Yet, since we're talking about free software and no dominating system, most software will be available for all systems, so we won't have a problem that something works for one system but not another one. I do believe it's possible.
 Thoughts?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[11月8日，记者从GPU巨头英伟达处获悉，该公司将于第三季度投产NVIDIA A800 GPU（以下简称“A800”）。根据英伟达的说法，A800是面向中国客户的NVIDIA A100 GPU（以下简称“A100”）替代产品，A800符合美国政府关于出口管制的明确测试，并且不能编程超过该限制。


今年8月底，英伟达发布公告称接到美国政府通知，对英伟达未来向中国出口的A100和即将推出的H100集成电路实施了新的许可要求。随后在公布二季度业绩时，英伟达创始人兼首席执行官黄仁勋提出，会推出不受限制的替代版本。


对业绩增长放缓的英伟达来说，中国市场的重要性不言而喻，毕竟根据财报数据，过去一年里，英伟达从中国业务区获得了71.11亿美元的收入，占公司营收比例达26.4%。


从性能上看，根据英伟达官网介绍，A100可划分为七个GPU实例，提供40GB和80GB显存两种版本，A100 80GB可提供超快速的显存带宽（每秒超过2万亿字节），处理超大型模型和数据集。从目前媒体披露的信息来看，A800芯片数据传输速率为每秒400GB，低于A100，美方新的出口管制规定将芯片数据传输速率限制在每秒600GB。


值得一提的是，随着挖矿热潮的结束，市场对于高端显卡的需求有所下滑。从此前公布的财报数据来看，英伟达2022年二季度营收67亿美元，环比跌幅为19%；净利润6.56亿美元，环比下降59%，降回到两年前同期水准。


早在受限消息传出的9月初，芯谋研究高级分析师张彬磊就曾通过微信及电话向记者介绍，一方面，就目前国内已经商业化的一些GPU跟英伟达的差距来看，需要三至五年时间来“追赶”方能满足市场需求。但另一方面，受限将会促进国产GPU的发展，推动国内相关厂商的崛起。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I created a system for building SVG-only websites called Svija.  But, though the content was nice, the sites felt too static — a bit flat and lifeless. Even a basic HTML website has mouseover effects, but SVG doesn't have them for free the way HTML does.
I wanted to find an easy way to recreate mouseover functionality in SVG. For my first try, I labeled objects in Adobe Illustrator:
  • linkSomeName: an invisible link  (over the link text)
  • mouseoverSomeName: a  mouseover decoration (usually bold or colored text, or an underline), initially hidden

Once I had used it for a bit, I thought that it might be nicer if the effects faded in and out. So, I tried animating the transitions with GSAP. It immediately became clear that there was enormous potential to manage complex animations visually, and I worked over the 
summer to create Svija Vibe.
It's all based on linking Adobe Illustrator object names to the GSAP script. Most basic transformations already work well but there's a lot I'll be able to do to make it even simpler to use.
I'm really excited about it! I've only just started but I have a million ideas about how to make it more capable — the big one being the ability to chain animations together.
There's a support document at https://tech.svija.love/how/animation that gives more detail about exactly what can be done.
Svija Vibe is free. It works with Svija, which is also free, but you do need to create an account to use it (Maconly, at least for the next three months).

It's a chrome extension that allows discussion on any webpage to happen there itself.
Currently I have built threaded comments, and a upvote/downvote system.
Plus I've built this cool feature called Highlights, which lets you discuss specific lines in any documentation. As well as a feature called Top Hightlights, which shows the most interesting hightlights on any webpage.
Hope you guys will try it out. And if you have any questions, feel free to ask me here.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi HN, I have been making this Cozo database since half a year ago, and now it is ready for public release.
My initial motivation is that I want a graph database. Lightweight and easy to use, like SQLite. Powerful and performant, like Postgres. I found none of the existing solutions good enough.
Deciding to roll my own, I need to choose a query language. I am familiar with Cypher but consider it not much of an improvement over CTE in SQL (Cypher is sometimes notationally more convenient, but not more expressive). I like Gremlin but would prefer something more declarative. Experimentations with Datomic and its clones convinced me that Datalog is the way to go.
Then I need a data model. I find the property graph model (Neo4j, etc.) over-constraining, and the triple store model (Datomic, etc.) suffering from inherent performance problems. They also lack the most important property of the relational model: being an algebra. Non-algebraic models are not very composable: you may store data as property graphs or triples, but when you do a query, you always get back relations. So I decided to have relational algebra as the data model.
The end result, I now present to you. Let me know what you think, good or bad, and I'll do my best to address them. This is the first time that I use Rust in a significant project, and I love the experience!

被下载了数千次的偷取密码的 Python 软件包

安全研究专家在 PyPi 上发现了 30 多个恶意 Python 软件包，试图安装 W4SP，这是一个可以从浏览器会话中偷取密码和 Cookie 的脚本。这些恶意软件包的名字听起来很普通，比如 typeutil、colorwin 等等。攻击者通常会复制一个现有的软件包，并稍作修改，以使用户错误输入时无意中安装了恶意软件。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[有关 Xfce 4.18 的核心和原生应用程序的功能的全面介绍。


经过近两年的开发，Xfce 4.18 将在 2022 年圣诞节期间发布。作为 Xfce 4.16 以来的重要的版本，其一直在开发标签 4.17 下进行开发，以增强这个轻量级桌面。

考虑到 GTK4 的更新、初步的 Wayland 支持，以及核心和本地应用程序的改进，Xfce 4.18 是一个重要的里程碑版本，其带来了大量更新。

从发布时间来看，第一个 Xfce 4.18 预发布版（pre1）已经发布。2022 年 12 月的第一周会有另一个预发布版。而 Xfce 4.18 的最终版本预计将在 2022 年 12 月 15 日至 12 月 29 日之间发布。

由于目前还没有官方的详细介绍，我在这篇文章中总结了 Xfce 4.18 的基本和主要功能。

请继续阅读。



Xfce 4.18 的新功能

1、核心库更新

Xfce 4.18 的依赖关系有所改变，并使用以下版本进行编译：


glib-2.0 >= 2.66

gtk >= 3.24

libcairo >= 1.16

gdk-pixbuf-2.0 >= 2.40

gobject-introspection >= 1.66


2、桌面和面板

顶部的主面板带来了新的设置和调整。但整体外观仍与以前的 4.16 版本中的一样。一些默认的面板小程序在这个版本中也有变化。桌面图标、右键上下文菜单和项目保持不变。

面板的首选项设置有两个新的选项。首先，面板的长度现在以像素设置，而不是百分比。其次，一个新的选项，“保持面板在窗口上方Keep panel above windows” ，可以让你将窗口对话放到面板后面。之前，应用程序的窗口只能达到面板的边缘。



彻底修改了时钟小程序的设置。是的，你…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[了解 Ansible 的新徽标是如何根据相关人员的意见开发的，以确保整个项目的品牌一致性。




作为红帽的用户体验（UX）设计和 Ansible 产品团队的交互设计师，我们花了大约 6 个月的时间为 Ansible 社区设计了一系列徽标。这件事其实在更早的时候就开始了，当时一位项目经理要求我们为一个幻灯片提供一个 “快速而简单” 的徽标。在收集了一些需求后，我们在几天内就向相关人员展示了一个徽标，而且没有经过太多调整。几个月后，另一个相关人员说他们也需要类似的徽标，所以我们重复了这个过程。

于是，我们注意到一个模式：像这样的徽标资源不仅仅代表个人的要求，而是整个 Ansible 项目的共同需要。在完成了几个徽标要求后，我们有了一系列临时的设计，但在没有意识到品牌和设计惯例的情况下，这可能给整个 Ansible 的品牌视觉造成了不一致。随着这个徽标系列的增加，我们认识到了这个迫在眉睫的问题，并需要解决它。

我们的解决方案是创建一个 Ansible 设计系统，这是一个针对品牌的资源，可以指导未来一致的徽标设计。

什么是设计系统？

设计系统是一个可重复使用的资源和指导方法的集合，有助于告知任何数字产品套件的视觉语言。设计系统创造了一些模式，将独立的产品整合在一起，并通过可扩展性和一致性提升品牌。

特别是在一个有多种产品的大公司里，如果没有标准化，扩展起来就不容易，因为不同的团队对每个产品都有贡献。设计系统可以作为每个团队建立新资产的基线。有了标准化的外观和感觉，产品在整个组合中被统一为一个家族。

从头构建一个设计系统

在收到相关人员提出的为 Ansible 开源社区（如 Ansible Builder、Ansible Runner 和Project Receptor）创建徽标的一系列要求后，我们决定为我们的工作流程设计一个结构，并创建一个单一…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[本指南旨在帮助你在 Firefox、Chrome、Chromium 和 Edge 等流行的网页浏览器中启用深色模式。


我们都喜欢深色模式。与标准浅色模式相比，许多人更喜欢它。许多桌面应用原生提供深色模式，而一些应用则是通过桌面环境的底层模式适应深色模式。

不可否认，我们都在网页浏览器上花费了很多时间。我们很少使用桌面应用（除非你从事专门的工作，例如视频编辑等）。因此，当你花费大量时间在浏览器中阅读和学习时，你始终可以选择深色模式。不过，对于网页浏览器，启用深色模式的方法略有不同。

本指南为你提供了在 Firefox、Chromium、Chrome 和 Edge 浏览器中启用深色模式的简单步骤。

在网页浏览器中启用深色模式

在 Firefox 中启用深色模式

打开 Firefox 并点击右上角的菜单。

单击 “设置Settings > 扩展和主题Extension and Themes”。

选择 “深色主题Dark Theme” 并点击 “启用enable”。你应该会看到深色模式已应用于 Firefox。



在 Firefox 浏览器中启用深色模式



深色模式下的 Firefox

要将其还原，请按照相同的步骤并选择浅色主题。

Chromium 和 Chrome 中的深色模式

默认情况下，Chromium 或 Chrome 不会预安装任何深色主题。因此，你需要前往 Chrome 应用商店并下载你想要的深色主题。对于本指南，我会推荐超过一百万用户使用的 “Morpheon Dark” 主题。

从 Chromium 浏览器打开 Morpheon Dark 主题页面（以下链接）。


Chrome 应用商店中的 Morpheon Dark 主题


点击 “添加到 ChromeAdd To Chrome” 按钮。它应该会在 Chrome 中启用。

你可能想探索 Chrome 应用店中提供的其他深色或浅色主题。 访问此页面获取所有深色主题的集合。

但是，你应该要记住的一件事是：此主题不会更改设置或上下文菜单，这是显而易见的。因为它只是改变了浏览器窗口，而这些菜单（有时）是操作系统本身的一部分。



Chromium 深色主题

对 Chrome 浏览器也遵循相同的步骤。

Edge 浏览器 – 深色模式

但是，Edge 浏览器 默认带有更好的深色主题。它允许你从设置中使用 GTK+、浅色和深色模式。

打开 Edge 浏览器，点击右上角的三个小点。

转到 “外观Appearance” 并选择 “深色Dark”。这样应该就好了。

Edge 的这种深色主题实现更好，因为它改变了上下文菜单和地址栏。



深色主题的 Edge

总结

如果你是高级用户，你可能不需要本指南。你可以自己弄清楚。

但我们为所有读者涵盖了所有基础到高级教程。许多新的 Linux 用户可能不知道如何在浏览器中启用深色模式。

所以，就是说，我希望这对你和其他人有帮助。如果你遇到任何问题，请在下面的评论框中告诉我。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Yitang Zhang, the mathematician behind the 2013 breakthrough on bounded gaps in primes, posted to the arxiv today a result which (if correct) comes close to proving the nonexistence of Landau--Siegel zeros: https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.02515.
To give a sense of the scale of this claim: If correct, Zhang's work is the most significant progress towards the Generalized Riemann Hypothesis in a century. Moreover, I think this result would not only be a more significant advance than Zhang's previous breakthrough, but also constitute a larger leap for number theory than Wiles' 1994 proof of Fermat's Last Theorem (which was, in my opinion, the greatest single achievement by an individual mathematician in the 20th century).
Some discussion / explanation of Siegel zeros and Zhang's claim can be found here:

An account of Zhang's remarkable story (and his previous breakthrough) can be found here. Famously, prior to his breakthrough, he worked at Subway and lived in his car:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm curious if there are any paid services that offer to fix Linux issues. Not just a support team--but it would include support. For example, I have a weird issue in Firefox right now where scrolling "sputters" only occasionally, and usually only in Reddit. There are plenty of helpful forums, but I also want to focus on business problems and would rather some other expert could help me fix this in a jiffy.
 I think it would be so cool if I could subscribe for $50/mo to $150/mo to a company that would take my support issues seriously--either help me to resolve them if possible, or if unable, escalate to a team of expert Linux software engineers who could dig into the various systems, subsystems, and open source software code, and fix them. I would happily pay this monthly fee for the assurance that my Linux laptop works beautifully. If my issue results in a software patch, all the better for the community.
 I'm not a corporate customer, so I don't think Redhat Enterprise is a fit here. But maybe someone could correct me if I'm wrong.
 Does something like this exist?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[罗马数字是欧洲在阿拉伯数字传入之前使用的一种数码，现在应用较少。它的产生晚于中国甲骨文中的数码，更晚于埃及人的十进制数字。


罗马数字是阿拉伯数字传入之前使用的一种数码。其采用七个罗马字母作数字、即I（1）、X（10）、C（100）、M（1000）、V（5）、L（50）、D（500）。罗马数字的记数方法是：相同的数字连写，所表示的数等于这些数字相加得到的数；小的数字在大的数字的右边，所表示的数等于这些数字相加得到的数；小的数字在大的数字的左边，所表示的数等于大数减小数得到的数。


在程序设计的时候，有时候会出现使用正则表达式匹配罗马数字的问题，这里给一下解决方案：


未经验证的罗马数字：


^[MDCLXVI]+$


严格验证罗马数字：


^(?=[MDCLXVI])M*(C[MD]|D?C{0,3})(X[CL]|L?X{0,3})(I[XV]|V?I{ 0,3})$


灵活验证罗马数字：


^(?=[MDCLXVI])M*(C[MD]|D?C*)(X[CL]|L?X*)(I[XV]|V?I*)$


简单的罗马数字：


^(?=[MDCLXVI])M*D?C{0,4}L?X{0,4}V?I{0,4}$


以上正则表达式适用的编程语言： .NET、Java、JavaScript、PCRE、Perl、Python、Ruby]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[systemd 252 如预期的锁定了 Linux 引导过程

之前，我们 报道 过，systemd 创始人发文指出 Linux 引导过程不安全，并提出采用加密签名的统一内核镜像（UKI），使用 TPM 2.0 硬件加强 Linux 系统启动过程的安全性。UKI 将 Linux 内核和 initrd，以及一些其他的小组件，合并到一个文件中，允许整个文件被加密签名。在刚刚发布的 systemd 252 中，几个重要的功能都与新的 UKI 全签名启动过程有关。除此以外，还很一些重要特性也值得关注。


消息来源：The Register



老王点评：我是觉得 sytemd 有些激进了，虽然确实 systemd 在引入新特性方面进展很快。




Mastodon 用户激增

在埃隆·马斯克接管 Twitter 的一周内，Mastodon 激增了 23 万名用户，月活用户已达 65 万。但与 Twitter 相比，仍然非常少，Twitter 有将近 “2.38 亿日活用户”。其创始人说，“它显然没有 Twitter 那么大，但它是这个网络有史以来最大的。”Mastodon 出现于 2016 年，可以免费使用，也没有广告，由一个非营利组织开发的，并通过众筹获得支持。


消息来源：CNN



老王点评：没用过，也不知道是啥。




Arc 显卡的更新只能在支持英特尔 ME 的系统进行

英特尔管理引擎（ME）是隐藏在英特尔 CPU 中的一个操作系统，它是一个修改版的 MINIX 3，运行在用户根本接触不到的 -3 层。这个事情我们以前 介绍 过。根据 Fwupd 开发者的消息，至少现在，英特尔的 Arc 显卡只能通过 ME 来更新其图形系统控制器的固件。因此，旧的英特尔系统或非英特尔系统，如 AMD、RISC-V 等系统，将无法更新 Arc 显卡的固件。


消息来源：Phoronix



老王点评：这显然是越来越封闭了。从最近的一些趋势来看，一些硬件厂商看似开放，其实本质上还是想各种办法封闭起来。]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[你上次更新通过 Pip 安装的 Python 软件包是什么时候？大多数用户往往会忘记这些 Python 软件包也需要手动更新，因为仅仅更新系统存储库对于软件包来说是不起作用的。

因此，让我们花点时间看看如何使用 Pip，来更新旧的 Python 软件包吧。

如何使用 Pip 升级 Python 软件包

Pip（Pip Installs Packages） 是一个用于管理 Python 软件包的 命令行实用程序command line utility 。你可以将 Pip 安装 Python 软件包，类比为在 Ubuntu 和 Debian 中使用 apt 管理软件包那样。

因此，接下来就让我们深入了解如何使用这个极好的工具 Pip，来管理与 Python 软件包相关的内容吧。

1、列出过时的 Python 软件包

在计划更新什么软件包之前，我们先要列出有哪些过时的软件包，你可以在其中选择想要更新的软件包，因为大多数人不会想一下子更新整个软件包库。

要列出过时的 Python 软件包，你只需将 pip 命令与 list 选项、--outdated 标志一同使用即可，如下图所示：

pip list --outdated




2、升级特定的软件包

获得可更新的软件包列表后，你可以像我之前提到的那样，选择你要更新的那个特定的软件包，pip 升级软件包命令的语法如下：

pip install package_name -U


例如，我想将名为 anime-api 的软件包升级到最新版本，所以我将使用下面的命令来升级：

pip install anime-api -U




3、将软件包升级到特定的版本

没有必要总是使用软件的最新版本，如果你想将软件包升级到不是最新的某个特定版本，参考如下的命令语法：

pip install --upgrade <package>==<version>


例如，我想将名为 xdg 的软件包更新到 5.1 版本，5.1 版本是最新版本的前一个版本，所以可以使用以下命令：

pip install --upgrade xdg==5.1




4、使用 Pip 一次性升级所有软件包

请注意：我不建议你一次性升级所以软件包，因为 Python 软件包的依赖项太复杂了，一次性的升级无法处理相互依赖项。

要一次性升级所有 python 软件包，你可以使用以下命令：

pip3 list --outdated --format=freeze | grep -v '^\-e' | cut -d = -f 1 | xargs -n1 pip3 install -U




上面的命令使用了 xargs。首先，会得到所有需要更新的软件包，然后对每个软件包执行 pip3 install -U 命令。

我在这里使用的是 pip3，而不是 pip。在 Ubuntu 22.04 及更高的版本中，pip 和 pip3 命令都可以使用。

总结

使用 Pip 一次性更新所有 Python 软件包并不是一个好主意。我发现一次性更新后，软件包之间的依赖关系被破坏了，所以请确保只更新你想要更新的软件包。

如果你还有其他的疑问，就请在评论区中留言吧。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[想知道如何在台式机或笔记本电脑上检查 Ubuntu 和其他 Linux 中的 CPU 和硬盘温度？这是一个快速指南。


如果你是普通用户，那么实际上不需要检查 CPU 或 HDD 温度。但是，如果你使用的是非常旧的硬件或轻薄型的硬件，你可能会遇到过热问题。因为这些薄的硬件内部紧密耦合在一起，无论做了多少传热机制，它都会升温。因此，必须监控硬件的温度。然而，现代 Linux 发行版能够通过软件传感器很好地处理过热情况。

在 Ubuntu 上监控 CPU 和硬盘温度的步骤

使用终端

我们将使用几个包来实现相同的目的。在基于 Ubuntu 的系统中打开一个终端并安装以下内容。

sudo apt install hddtemp
sudo apt install lm-sensors


hddtemp 程序为你提供硬盘和 SSD （根据我的测试）的温度。 lm-sensors 包为你提供来自 CPU 和其他通过 PCI 端口访问的传感器的温度详细信息。

安装后，从终端运行以下命令。你需要知道你的磁盘标识符，例如 /dev/sda 或 /dev/sdb 等。

要找出磁盘标识符，你可以使用 fdisk。

sudo fdisk -l


然后运行以下命令检查 HDD 或 SSD 温度。

sudo hddtemp




来自终端的 HDD 或 SSD 温度

检查 CPU 温度和其他信息需要额外的步骤。

首先，运行以下命令，以便传感器程序可以检测到系统中的传感器。

sudo sensors-detect


上面的命令可能会问你一些是/否的问题。继续按回车选择默认选项。

完成后，运行以下命令查看 CPU 和其他接口温度。

sensors




使用传感器

使用 GUI 工具

如果你更喜欢能完成上述所有操作的漂亮 GUI，你可以安装 psensor。该程序适用于 Linux 系统，例如 Ubuntu、Fedora、Arch 和其他变体。它为你提供了漂亮的图形和表格视图：

Ubuntu 及其衍生版：

sudo apt install psensor


Fedora 和基于 RPM 的衍生版：

sudo dnf install psensor


Arch、Manjaro 和类似的衍生版：

pacman -S psensor


安装后，从终端运行 psensor 或从应用菜单启动它。

正如你在下面的截图中所见，它通过漂亮的图表让你可以很好地了解 CPU、GPU 和 HDD 的所有重要温度。使用它的首选项，你可以根据需要对其进行调整。这个轻量级的程序在很多情况下都会很有帮助。



psensor 运行

因此，这些是你可以在 Ubuntu 和其他 Linux 系统中监控 CPU、GPU 或 HDD 温度的一些方法。如果你知道其他方法，请通过下面的评论栏告诉我。

 What I love:
 The privacy of Linux, knowing that they aren't using my data for shady purposes has been great. 
 Customizing the desktop to my preferences.
 Using an app store is the way of the future, 1 click installs are way better than downloading exe files off the internet.
 Updating the whole system with 1 click which would take about 30 mins to do for every app on windows.
 Even the most bloated DE is light compared to windows and doesn't kill my PC.
 Open source apps are genuinely great and polished, I've switched to LibreOffice for school work, and so has my university, our PCs now run Ubuntu.

 Anybody have any experience with their software?
 ​
 They mention even having a secure hypervisor, which actually brings to question. How well "hardened" are these hyperisors like Proxmox?
 I don't think Ubuntu comes with anything like Selinux. Which is why I often wished Proxmox would be based on rhel or distro based on that.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have a ton (2-3 TB) of home recorded videos and photos on my debian server, that I would like to view on my Samsung TV using the built in uPNP/DNLA client. I do not need alle kind of weird clients, etc, etc, just for my wife and I to be able to walk down memory lane on the TV. So, I really only need to be able to browse by year/month and have something that lists the entries in date/time order. The video clips are typically less than a couple of minutes long, so they need to be served pretty quick, delays of 10-15 seconds when browsing really kills the experience. 
 I would like a simple service on my debian server, that either runs in a container or from the apt system and automatically transcode the source material to something the TV can understand. However, it seems really complicated, with kodi requiring visual configuration, UMS apparently not very good at transcoding, and so on.
 At this point I would really appreciate some tips to a simple solution that works well with a newish (2021) Samsung TV. I prefer OSS -- what media server should I focus on? Jellyfin? 
 Thanks in advance for any help.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Every time I do a fresh install, I get an itch to just go all FLOSS with my games and not install Steam. But after a little scrolling and maybe a few installs/deinstalls, I realize that the games in the repo are just not up to par.
 One wonders if there is some specific rule that new games just can't fulfill in order to get included in the repo. But that can't be the case because a whole 2 or 3 games actually look presentable. Tux kart looks good and playable, and 0ad is probably the best looking game and the only game I have seen that actually gets good regular updates and it feels like some effort has been put into it. Xonotic is nice, but it couldn't compete even with the game from 1999 it tries to imitate. Super tux is also good.
 A few honourable mentions that look like they tried - the rips of old tycoon games, red alert looks interesting (though I haven't tried it), the absolutely boring and empty minecraft clone, the few city building games...
 And the rest is just on a level below windows 98 minesweeper - projects a student could make as homework. 
 I refuse to believe that there are no people who can make good sprites, good mechanics, and nice-looking games that look and feel like they were made in this century. 
 So, purely logically, if there are 2-3 games that actually look ok-ish, then that means it is possible to put such games in the repo. The question remains why would people rather put their games in the AUR then have them in the repo, which I think is a high honor and good for the users as well because they don't have to mess with the AUR?
 Does the repo maybe require the maker to regularly update the game or something that people are not willing to do? 
 I just don't get it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi HN! We’re building an open-source pricing & packaging engine for SaaS with a built-in billing system. (https://github.com/uselotus/lotus).
We strongly believe pricing is the largest untapped growth lever for SaaS, primarily because pricing affects so many critical systems that don’t talk to each other (billing, payments, feature limits, metering, and CRM). We’re building this infrastructure to fix this and enable quick experimentation.
Lotus acts as a central repository for all of your pricing plans and utilizes your payment gateway, to manage usage-based, per-seat, and custom enterprise pricing. We’re excited to open-source this because we want to enable developers to build their custom pricing and integration edge cases on top of this base.
We’ve launched this repo under an MIT license so any developer can use the tool. Give it a spin for us at either:
* test our cloud version at (https://demo.uselotus.io)
* self-host here (https://github.com/uselotus/lotus) 
and let us know what you think.
All feedback is appreciated! If the project is especially relevant to you, follow us and we’ll keep you updated when we’ve fully published all our beta features.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi HN! This started late last year as an afternoon project to play around with ElasticSearch, and then I kept thinking of new features I wanted to add. I still have a lot of things I want to build, but now seemed like a good time to put it out there: even if the results aren’t nearly the quality I’d like, I’ve still found it useful and I want to show it off!
I’ve been working on it since September 2021, but only in fits and starts. The entire thing runs on a computer in my living room (there’s a picture on the About page); I haven’t done any load testing so we’ll see how it holds up.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[据路透社报道，推特5日正式推出全新订阅服务，每月收费8美元，以向用户提供蓝色认证标记(“蓝V”)，同时在苹果应用程序商店App Store推出更新版本。这是马斯克对推特的第一次重大修订。据悉，新服务目前仅供美国、加拿大、澳大利亚、新西兰和英国用户使用。马斯克表示，一旦确认新服务运作良好，并完成相关翻译工作，将会在全球各地推广。


据报道，在针对苹果iOS设备的更新说明中，推特表示，“立即注册”的用户可花费每月7.99美元在他们的用户名称旁边加入广受欢迎的“蓝V认证”，“就像你所追踪的名人、企业和政治人物一样”。


据iOS更新通知，订阅方案的其他好处还包括广告量减半、可上传较长的影片、以及根据内容质量排列推文等。


在马斯克接手推特之前，“蓝V认证”意味着推特确认该帐户的真实身份为个人或公司拥有。但推出全新订阅服务后，目前尚不清楚推特如何在收费之外验证用户的身份。


据悉，这项新服务目前仅提供美国、加拿大、澳大利亚、新西兰和英国用户使用。


马斯克5日发布推文称，“一旦我们确认新服务在首批试行国家运作良好，并完成相关翻译工作，这项服务就会在全球各地正式推出。”

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[GitHub Copilot 被诉“规模空前的软件盗版”

周四，有程序员在旧金山提起诉讼，称其代表数百万可能受每月 10 美元的 Copilot 服务影响的 GitHub 用户。该诉讼旨在挑战 GitHub Copilot 的合法性。诉讼对象包括 GitHub 其所有者微软，以及为该工具提供支持的 OpenAI。该诉讼认为“被告已经侵犯了大量创作者的合法权利，这些创作者在 GitHub 上根据某些开源许可证发布代码或其他作品。”包括 MIT 许可证、GPL 许可证和 Apache 许可证等 11 个流行的开源许可证，都要求注明作者姓名和版权。Copilot 违反并删除这些许可证，“因此，它正在实施规模空前的软件盗版行为。”


消息来源：IT Pro



老王点评：虽然可能是旷日持久的诉讼，但是目前的 AI 没有理会开源许可证就直接拿过来用代码的方式，肯定是有问题的。




经过六年等待，Rust 终于支持通用关联类型了

最新的 Rust 稳定版 1.65.0 支持了通用关联类型（GAT），可以在关联类型上声明生命期、类型和常量泛型。Rust 官方称，“很难用几个字来形容这些东西有多有用。”为了支持 GAT，必须对编译器进行大量的修改，而这项功能的 RFC 是 2016 年提出的。总的来说，GAT 为大量的模式和 API 提供了基础性的依据。大量项目因为 GAT 的稳定而受阻。即使你不需要直接使用 GAT，你所使用的库也很有可能在内部或公开场合使用它，很多时候，GAT 是唯一实现方式。


消息来源：Slashdot



老王点评：Rust 越来越发展完善，真的可以预期成为主要的底层语言。




谷歌计划建立支持世界上 1000 种最常用的语言的 AI 模型

该公司公布了一个经过 400 多种语言训练的 AI 模型，它将其描述为 “目前在语音模型中看到的最大的语言覆盖范围”，并宣布建立一个支持 1000 种语言的模型。谷歌认为，创建一个如此规模的模型将使其更容易将各种人工智能功能带入在线空间和人工智能训练数据集中表现不佳的语言（也被称为 “低资源语言”）。谷歌称，建立单一模型，而不是建立 1000 种不同的模型，有助于 AI 将从高资源语言获得的能力转化为低资源语言的能力。


消息来源：The Verge



老王点评：这样的进展，或许过几年，不需要专门学习外语了。]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[安卓的一个重要进展是将安卓开源项目Android Open Source Project（AOSP）移植到 RISC-V 处理器架构。




AOSP 已经开始在上游启用 RISC-V，这将促进 RISC-V CPU 在可穿戴设备、物联网，以及最终在智能手机和笔记本电脑中的使用。

为了开放生态系统，中国科学院 PLCT 实验室的工程师和软件开发人员在 2020 年开始将 Android 10 移植到 RISC-V 架构上。阿里巴巴的云计算部门和平头哥芯片子公司一起努力保持开发与最新的安卓版本同步。

“我们很高兴看到谷歌对构建针对 RISC-V 的 AOSP 的更多支持！阿里云一直致力于通过一系列的创新来支持 RISC-V 社区的发展，比如将安卓的基本功能移植到 RISC-V 上，这证明了在从多媒体到信号处理、设备互联和人工智能等场景中使用基于 RISC-V 的设备的可行性。”阿里云生态系统总监、RISC-V 国际组织的应用与工具水平委员会副主席 David Chen 博士说：“我们期待着与安卓团队合作，为繁荣的 RISC-V 社区做出贡献。”

通过增强 RISC-V 上的安卓系统的基本功能，在 2021 年，阿里云的专家们付出了巨大的努力，积极推动了软件生态系统的发展。 RISC-V on Android 的工作集中在 RISC-V Android 工作组和软件库中进行。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[git log 命令是 Git 中一个很重要的查看提交记录的工具，它也是人们喜欢使用 Git 的原因之一。


git log 命令能够让你了解到更多关于贡献者 提交commit 的记录。使用 git log 的一种方式是按日期查看提交记录 。要查看在指定日期或日期范围内创建的 Git 存储库中的提交记录，请使用带有选项 --since 或 --until 或者同时使用以上两个选项的 git log 命令。

首先，进入你要查看的分支（例如，main 分支）：

$ git checkout main


接下来，你可以使用以下命令，来显示当前日期（即今天）的提交记录：

$ git log --oneline --since="yesterday"


仅显示某一特定用户（例如，用户 Agil）在今天的提交记录：

$ git log --oneline --since="yesterday" --author="Agil"


还可以显示在某一日期范围内的提交记录。使用以下命令，显示在任意两个日期之间（例如，2022 年 4 月 22 日至 2022 年 4 月 24 日）的提交记录：

$ git log --oneline --since="2022-04-22" --until="2022-04-24"


在上面这个例子中，会输出 2022 年 4 月 22 日至 2022 年 4 月 24 日期间，不包括 2022 年 4 月 22 日的所有提交记录。如果你想要包括 2022 年 4 月 22 日的提交记录，请将命令中的 2022-04-22 替换为 2022-04-21。

运行以下命令，能够显示某一特定用户（例如，用户 Agil）在两个指定的日期之间的提交记录：

$ git log --oneline --since="2022-04-22" --until="2022-04-24" --author="Agil"


总结

Git 有很多优点，其中一个优点就是 Git 让你能够收集你项目的相关数据。git log 命令是一个重要的查看提交记录的工具，也是人们喜欢使用 Git 的原因之一！

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I live with minor visual impairment and while I generally have no problems seeing what's on my screen I occasionally find myself having to strain or lean in for smaller UI elements. I've tried altering the dpi and system wide font settings but I end up missing the extra screen real estate too much.
 I've found the Hover Text accessibility feature on Mac to be the perfect solution for this; it renders whatever text your mouse is currently hovering over at a high resolution as long as a key is held down, and I believe the font and contrast can be customized. So far I can't find any such equivalents in my system's package database. The programs I have tried all spawn a persistent window that takes up significant amounts of space, and rather than rendering just the text they instead blow up everything in a specific screen region, resulting in highly pixelated text obscured by irrelevant background noise.
 If a package doesn't already exist for it I would be willing to figure something out myself, even despite a lack of experience. The closest approximation I can think of off-hand would be to make a custom script that spawns an xzoom window on key-press, but that seems kind of fiddly and doesn't address the issue of the pixelated text. Is there a small cli program I can use to grab just the text string itself? Any other solutions or ideas would be greatly appreciated.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[这个带有脚本的快速指南有助于清理旧的 Snap 版本并释放 Ubuntu 系统中的一些磁盘空间。


我正在使用的 Ubuntu 测试系统中的磁盘空间不足。因此，我通过 GNOME 的磁盘使用分析器进行调查，以找出哪个包正在消耗宝贵的 SSD 空间。除了通常的缓存和主目录，令我惊讶的是，我发现 Snap 和 Flatpak 消耗了大量的存储空间。



尽管如此，我始终坚持一个规则：除非必要，否则不要使用 Snap 或 Flatpak。这主要是因为它们的安装尺寸和其他问题。我更喜欢原生 deb 和 rpm 包。多年来，我在这个测试系统中安装和移除了一定数量的 Snap 包。

但卸载后还有问题。Snap 在系统中保留了一些残留文件，一般用户不知道。

所以我打开了 Snap 文件夹 /var/lib/snapd/snaps，发现 Snap 保留了以前安装/卸载的软件包的旧版本。

例如，在下图中，你可以看到 GNOME 3.28、3.34 和 Wine 都被删除了。但它们还在那里。发生这种情况是因为 Snap 的设计，它在正确卸载后保留已卸载软件包的版本。



或者，你可以在终端中使用：

snap list --all




对于保留的版本，默认值为 3。这意味着 Snap 会保留每个软件包的三个旧版本，包括活动版本。如果你对磁盘空间没有限制，这是可以的。

但是对于服务器和其他情况，这很容易遇到成本问题，它会消耗你的磁盘空间。

但是，你可以使用以下命令轻松修改计数。该值可以在 2 到 20 之间。

sudo snap set system refresh.retain=2


清理 Snap 版本

在 SuperUser 的一篇文章中，Canonical 的前工程经理 Popey 提供了一个简单的脚本，它可以清理旧版本的 Snaps 并保留最新版本。

这是我们将用来清理 Snap 的脚本。

#!/bin/bash
#Removes old revisions of snaps
#CLOSE ALL SNAPS BEFORE RUNNING THIS
set -eu
LANG=en_US.UTF-8 snap list --all | awk '/disabled/{print $1, $3}' |
while read snapname revision; do
    snap remove "$snapname" --revision="$revision"
done


将上面的脚本以 .sh 扩展名保存在一个目录中（例如 clean_snap.sh），赋予它可执行权限并运行。

chmod +x clean_snap.sh


当我运行脚本后，它减少了很多磁盘空间。该脚本还将显示要删除的包的名称。





结束语

对于 Snap 的设计效率如何，人们总是争论不休。许多人说，它的设计是坏的，是臃肿的，是消耗系统资源的。这种说法的某些部分是真实的，我不会否认它。如果实施和加强得当，整个沙盒应用的概念是很好的。但我相信，与 Snap 相比，Flatpak 工作做得更好。

也就是说，我希望这可以帮助你清理一些磁盘空间。尽管它只在 Ubuntu 中进行了测试，但它应该适用于所有支持 Snap 的 Linux 发行版。

此外，请查看我们关于 如何清理 Ubuntu 的指南以及其他步骤。

最后，如果你要清理 Flatpak 应用，请参阅 这篇指南。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Back in 2003, there was a Brazilian distro called Kurumin, made by Carlos Eduardo Morimoto, which was a LiveCD based on Knoppix.
 It was incredibly famous and many people here had their first experience with Linux with this distro.
 In 2004, another project was started with the idea of expanding Kurumin... Big Linux.
 The then-new project was and still is, lead by Bruno Gonçalves, known as Big Bruno.
 In fact, in the very beginning, Big Linux was just a remastered Kurumin with more preinstalled stuff.
 Kurumin has been defunct since 2008. 
 But Big Linux remains active, has been, for 18 years. Although the project went dormant and almost got discontinued several times.
 It was based on Debian until 2021, when it was rebased to Manjaro (and by extension, to Arch Linux).
 Which means it's now a full blown rolling-release distro which packs the latest and greatest versions of almost all packages, including Linux 6.0.6 kernel and KDE Plasma 5.26.2 
 It has its own artwork, in-house built tools, and a few custom desktop layouts to choose from. And of course has a ton of preinstalled software (living up to its name)!
 The system is, as expected, due to its Manjaro base, very stable and fluid!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am working full remote right now(programming/gamedev) and I travel several times a year for periods of up to two months. Because of specifics of my job I need to have a powerful workstation(I mostly need a powerful CPU) and I am comfortable with at least two 27" monitors. Traveling with that much stuff is only possible with a car, and even then the whole setup takes too much space.
Laptops are getting there with the compute power, but the 27" monitors aren't getting any smaller. Meta Quest Pro(which seems to be the top of the line now) has been just released and even tho it is somewhat pricey($1500), it still costs as much as three good 27" monitors.
Does anyone have any useful experience to share on working in a VR headset? Is it comfortable for longer periods of time? How is it on the eyes?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Recently, I stumbled upon ihatemoney.org - a free and open source shared expenses manager and I found it great. It lets you create a group of members to manage settlements between them.
 The service has both a web app and mobile apps (Android and iOS) and does not even require registration! This is a breath of fresh air because other apps like this will require an app to be downloaded on your phone, a registration and possibly a paid upgrade if you don't want ads.
 Decided to share it here because the developers doubt the significance of this app.
 There is a demo instance available for everyone to fiddle with - try it, no more guessing how much money you owe to whom on a group trip.

一位工程师用两台不带显示器的 Commodore 64 “古代”电脑作为键盘，用五寸软盘粘在一起作为风箱，制作了一台可以演奏的手风琴。这个项目采用了大量定制的软件和硬件黑科技。通过测量风箱挤压时通过的空气噪音并转换为信号。Commodore 电脑本身没有音频设备，音频信号是通过插孔输出发声的。Commodore 64 是有史以来最畅销的电脑，于 1982 年开始生产。

Web 之父说 Web3 根本不是互联网

发明 Web 的蒂姆·伯纳斯-李在里斯本周五举行的 Web 峰会上表示，“真正的 Web3 的名字被以太坊的人拿去做区块链的东西，这真是一个耻辱。事实上，Web3 根本就不是 Web。”Web3 是科技界的一个模糊的术语，用来描述一个假设的未来版本的互联网，它比今天更去中心化，而不被各大巨头所支配。他认为需要澄清 Web 3 和 Web 3.0，并开发了自己的 Web 3.0 项目 Solid。

但是，在 Ventoy 出道之前，WoeUSB 是用于创建可启动 Windows USB 的首选工具。原版 WoeUSB 工程在 2014 年左右香消玉损。

鉴于其流行程度，一位新的开发者接过了将其起死回生的任务。因此，WoeUSB-ng 诞生了。在这里，“ng” 是 新生代new generation 的缩写。换句话说，WoeUSB-ng 是新生代的 WoeUSB 。但是，因为原版的工具已经不存在了，我将 WoeUSB-ng 描述为 WoeUSB 。

在这篇教程中，我将向你展示如何在 Ubuntu Linux 上安装 WoeUSB 。我也将分享使用 WoeUSB 来创建可启动 Windows USB 的步骤。

但是，在此之前，让我们快速查看这个令人惊叹的工具的特色。

WoeUSB



WoeUSB 是一个简单的工具，其唯一的目的是 在 Linux 上创建可启动 Windows USB 。

原版 WoeUSB 是一个 shell 脚本。这个原版 WoeUSB 被使用 Python 重写为 WoeUSB-ng ，它可以安装在你的系统上，并且通过命令行或 GUI 界面。

特色：


支持老式 PC 启动或 UEFI 启动

支持 FAT32 和 NTFS 文件系统

支持使用物理安装盘或磁盘镜像作为源

它可以用于 Windows Vista 及其更高版本的任意语言或变体版本

老式的 MBR/IBM PC 兼容启动模式

本机 UEFI 启动支持 Windows 7 及其更高版本的镜像（仅限于将 FAT 文件系统作为目标的情况）

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[据福布斯网站11月4日报道，社交媒体公司推特3日晚在加州联邦法院遭到集体诉讼，被控违反联邦和州劳工法，未能在4日计划大规模裁员之前向其员工通知到位。据悉，推特计划裁员一半。


据英国天空新闻网报道，埃隆·马斯克当地时间11月4日在推特发文回应推特公司裁员一事，马斯克在推特中写道：“关于推特公司裁员，不幸的是，当公司每天亏损超过400万美元时，这别无选择。每个离开的人都得到了3个月的遣散费，这比法律要求的高出50%。”


美国亿万富翁埃隆·马斯克近期完成了对推特的收购交易，此前有媒体曝光，他计划裁员50%。综合英国路透社、美国全国广播公司（NBC）最新报道，推特公司当地时间3日晚间向员工发布电子邮件通告，公司方将从4日早上开始通过电子邮件方式告知员工是否被裁员。


推特发送裁员通知，员工“一片混乱”


全球首富、特斯拉CEO埃隆·马斯克近期完成了对推特的收购交易。有媒体曝光，他计划裁员50%。综合英国路透社、美国全国广播公司（NBC）最新报道，推特公司当地时间3日晚间向员工发布电子邮件通告，公司方将从4日早上开始通过电子邮件方式告知员工是否被裁员。


据环球网援引NBC报道，推特通告称，“我们认识到这将影响到一些为推特做出了宝贵贡献的人，但不幸的是，为确保公司成功发展，这一（裁员）行动是有必要的。”


报道还称，一名推特员工透露，11月3日的这封电子邮件是在马斯克于当地时间10月27日收购推特后，推特工作人员首次收到来自公司的联系。关于这封邮件的影响，这名员工还说："完全是一片混乱，一屋子（人）都崩溃了，所有人都在盯着这封邮件。”


推特公司还表示，该公司的办公室将被暂时关闭，暂停任何门禁卡等证件的访问权限，以“帮助确保每名员工以及推特系统和客户数据的安全”。


值得注意的是，推特员工当地时间3日在美国旧金山联邦法院提起集体诉讼，指控推特在没有给予足够通知的情况下启动大规模裁员，违反联邦和加州法律。


在马斯克完成收购后，他对推特的改造计划受到关注，多家外媒报道称，他计划裁员50%。新加坡《联合早报》称，早些时候有消息称推特被收购后将裁员75%，但马斯克对此予以否认。不过，葛伯川崎财富和投资管理公司首席执行官戈贝尔说，管理马斯克资产的家族办公室负责人伯查尔告诉他，推特即将进行裁员，“预计大约有50%的人会被解雇”。


《华盛顿邮报》称，据知情人士透露，推特员工总数超过7000人，马斯克团队正在决定第一轮裁员计划，目标是裁掉约1/4的员工。


美国多家大型科技公司宣布裁员


宣布裁员的远不止推特一家公司，受通货膨胀加剧和经济形势恶化的影响，美国多家大型科技公司当地时间3日宣布裁员或暂停招聘。


据中新社消息，总部位于美国旧金山的在线支付公司Stripe首席执行官帕特里克·科里森3日在给员工的备忘录中说，公司将裁员14%。根据该备忘录，Stripe将把员工人数减少至约7000人，这意味着本轮裁员将影响约1100人。


科里森说，在通货膨胀加剧、经济衰退、利率上升、能源危机、投资预算紧缩和创业资金短缺的影响之下，裁员是必要的。


出行共享公司Lyft当日也宣布了裁员计划。在发给员工的备忘录中，Lyft首席执行官洛根·格林和总裁约翰·齐默表示，公司将裁员13%，所有部门都将受到影响。Lyft有5000多名员工，公司在3日提交的一份文件中确认了“解雇约683名员工”的计划。


美国有线电视新闻网报道称，亚马逊3日表示，受经济环境影响，公司计划暂停招聘数月。另外，谷歌母公司“字母表”、脸书母公司元宇宙平台等大型科技公司也纷纷加大了成本控制的力度。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[以下是快速检查在运行 Xorg 还是 Wayland 显示服务器的方法。


随着时间的推移，现代 Wayland 显示服务器正在进入所有 Linux 发行版。尽管老旧的 Xorg 仍然能用并且会继续存在，但 Wayland 无疑在安全性和其他性能方面更好。

但是，Xorg 不会很快完全淘汰。可能永远不会。

如果你在运行任何 Linux 发行版，如何检查运行的是 Xorg 还是 Wayland？下面是方法。

Wayland 或 Xorg：你在运行哪一个？

在你的 Linux 发行版（例如 Ubuntu、Fedora、Arch 等）中打开一个终端窗口（CTRL+ALT+T）。

然后输入以下命令并回车：

echo $XDG_SESSION_TYPE


命令输出会告诉你当前会话是 Wayland 还是 Xorg（X11）。

[debugpoint@fedora ~]$ echo $XDG_SESSION_TYPEwayland




这很简单。但是，还有其他方法。

其他方法

使用设置

如果你需要图形方法，请打开你的 Linux 发行版的设置应用。在关于部分，你应该看到某个标签下中的 Wayland/X11。

例如，在 GNOME 设置中，你可以在 “窗口子系统Windowing system” 下找到它，如下图所示：



使用会话值

你还可以使用 systemd 登录管理器 loginctl 找到它。请记住，它仅适用于基于 systemd 的系统。

打开终端并运行以下命令。你可以看到会话 id 值。在此示例中为 c2：

loginctl


现在，将会话 ID 传递给以下命令以获取显示服务器类型。确保将 c2 更改为你的系统规格。

loginctl show-session c2 -p Type




总结

这些是你可以确定在 Linux 系统中运行的是 Systemd 还是 Xorg 的一些方法。你还可以在 shell 脚本中使用上述命令来实现进一步的流程自动化。

祝好。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[我向所有的 Linux 初学者推荐以下这些命令。




在使用 Linux 命令行时，很容易就会迷失方向，这可能会导致灾难性的后果：我有一次使用删除命令 rm 删除文件，然而删除之后我才意识到我刚刚是删除了计算机的引导目录。后来，我学会了使用 pwd 命令，来知道当前在文件系统的哪个目录下；并且我使用了 trashy 和 trash-cli 这一命令行回收站工具（LCTT 译注：在删除文件时 trash-cli 会充当中间人，将文件先“删除”到桌面上的垃圾箱中，能够通过垃圾箱或通过终端的 trash 命令，来恢复垃圾箱中已删除的文件。）

当我刚开始使用 Linux 时，我有一个放在桌子上的“速查表”，它就是《101 条你应该知道的 Linux 命令》，我在管理 Linux 服务器时能参考速查表上面的这些命令。随着我越来越熟悉这些命令，我越来越精通服务器管理了。

以下是我认为最有用的 12 个 Linux 命令。

1、打印工作目录（pwd）

pwd 命令会打印出你的工作目录。换句话来说，它输出你当前所在目录的路径。pwd 命令有两种选项：-L 或 --logical（即逻辑路径）用来打印当前的目录路径（不解析符号链接），-P 或 --physial（即物理路径）会打印出解析符号链接后的物理目录。（LCTT 译注：你可以进一步阅读我们翻译的 另一篇文章。）

2、创建目录（mkdir）

使用 mkdir 命令来创建一个新目录，是非常容易的。以下命令，创建了一个名为 example 目录（若 example 已存在，则无法创建）：

$ mkdir example


你也可以在嵌套地创建目录及其子目录：

$ mkdir -p example/one/two


如果目录 example 和目录 one 都已存在，则仅会创建目录 two…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey Guys, I don't know if this is the right sub to ask this, if not, please could you tell me which is? Here I go: 
 I'm currently a beginner web developer. I haven't been on this career path for very long but do have a degree in software engineering so I know some basic stuff. A friend contacted me saying that he wants me to work/start as a devops in his company. He says he has an instructor that will guide and train me for the role. The work will be remote and the work is contact based, like projects and stuff. I'm not worried about the pay since this is an opportunity for me to get some work experience. So, I want to be prepared before the project starts as I have approximately 2 months. 
 Can you guys recommend a course that teaches me the basics of DevOps? I mean the technical side? I have searched around and found this course https://zerotomastery.io/courses/devops-bootcamp/ Will this be helpful to me? 
 Also, do you this will count as work experience? I mean if the project lasts 3 - 4 months?
 Thank you.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Around 10 months ago i made a post, saying how much the gnu/linux desktop experience had improved that year alone and here i am, doing it again. Think of it as a huge "thank you" to the developers of FOSS projects who made all this improvement possible.
 But seriously, looking even 10 months back, the linux desktop looked and felt completely differently. A lot of stuff has improved since then, plasma 5.24, 5.25 and now 5.26 have been huge updates to overall stability and responsiveness of the desktop and so have gnome versions 41, 42 and now 43. It's to a point where I can confidently say that the major linux desktops are on par with or even more polished than windows and MacOS. 
 Further more, linux gaming (on AMD at least) is to a point where i ask anyone with an AMD graphics card that they only use for gaming and uses windows... why? So many gaming enhancement tools have become prevalent to aid linux gaming in not only matching windows but in some ways even beating it . From the heroic games launcher, GE-Proton, xanmod kernel, GE kernel to mangohud and vkbasalt. All these tools are basically "linux exclusive" and some of them (GE-Proton and vkbasalt) even provide functionality that you cannot easily get on windows (having FSR upscaling on any game of my choosing can be a savior for low end systems or for older games that don't support native 1080p). All of these tools, combined with the general improvements to steam mean that for 99% of games on linux, the experience is: click install, wait, play. (excluding the like 3 games like Destiny 2 or Valorant that don't run)
 And let's not forget about the general performance improvements with every mesa driver, proton/wine or even linux kernel update (6.0 personally gave me a nice ~5% bump).
 And once again, thank you to all the developers and contributors who made all this possible!

there has been a stream of smaller patches that promise incremental
performance gains, at least for some types of applications.  Read on for an
overview of two of those patches, which make changes to the epoll system
calls and to NUMA balancing.  This work shows where developers are looking
for performance improvements — and that not everybody measures performance
the same way.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[2022年11月3日，提供了超过1100万本书的大型数字图书馆Z-Library的域名被美国邮政检查局查封，其DNS服务器也被没收，该网站提供了超过1100万本书和8400万篇文章，这吸引了稳定的用户群和数百万月度访问者。他们是否会以新域名重新上线，或者逐渐消失，还有待观察。


Z-Library上的书籍主要来自各个出版商，很多都是各种畅销书，格式有epub和kindle格式等等，书籍都没有DRM加密，可以下载到任何电子阅读器或平板电脑上。


普通用户每天可以下载10本书，如果需要每天下载更多书籍，需要每月缴纳几美元的订阅费。不过，Z-Library的使命一直是非商业性的，旨在为所有人提供无限制的免费访问。


据维基百科上的介绍，Z-Library（简称z-lib，前身为BookFinder）是一个电子图书馆和文件分享计划，用户可在此网站上下载期刊文章以及各种类型的书籍。根据Z-Library的说法，截至2022年6月12日，其共收录了10,456,034本书和84,837,646篇文章。Z-Library在其电子书搜索页面上宣称自己是“全球最大的数字图书馆”，并在文章搜索页面上称自身是“全球最大的科学文章存储库”。项目页面的页脚写有“自2009年起提供免费电子书”的字句。Z-Library跟Sci-Hub和创世纪图书馆一样，同是相对较著名的影子图书馆，出版商和政府组织在处理反盗版事宜时，通常会把这三个项目归类为同一类。]]></summary>

Not talking about theming, I'm talking about a full-on wrapper that would mesh with both propietary and open-source applications AND make them effectively act as GTK4 apps with full Wayland support.
 Again, don't flame me if this isn't possible, just explain why it isn't.

阿塔卡马亚毫米波干涉阵望远镜遭受严重网络攻击

前两天，位于智利的阿塔卡马沙漠的亚毫米波干涉阵望远镜（ALMA）遭受严重网络攻击。ALMA 是世界上规模最大、海拔最高、最灵敏的毫米波/亚毫米波干涉阵。ALMA 由 66 个观测天线组成。这次攻击造成 ALMA 停止科学观测，位于智利的网站全部下线。攻击并未造成天线或观测数据库受损，且目前网络威胁已得到控制。但 ALMA 仍未恢复正常运行。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[用这个方便的捕鼠器比喻来理解编译代码。


源代码必须要经过编译才能够运行程序，而对于开源软件，每个人都可以获取源代码。无论你是自己编写了代码，想要编译和运行它，还是下载了某人的项目来尝试它，了解如何通过 编译器 处理源代码，以及编译器如何处理这些代码，这都很有用。

创建一个更好的捕鼠器

一般情况我们不会将一个捕鼠器比作电脑，但不管你信不信，它确实与你正在使用的设备（手机或电脑）的 CPU 有一些相似之处。经典的捕鼠器（我说的不是 🐈）有两种状态：打开或者释放。你可以认为 打开 是将捕鼠器设置好准备捕获老鼠，以及 释放 是捕鼠器被老鼠触发。某种意义上来说，捕鼠器就像是一台有鼠标的电脑。你可以想象一下这个代码，用一种虚构的语言来描述这个过程：

if mousetrap == 0 then
  There's a mouse!
else
  There's no mouse yet.
end


换句话说，你可以基于捕鼠器的状态发现是否有老鼠（数据）。当然，捕鼠器不是万无一失的，有可能有一只老鼠在捕鼠器旁边，由于老鼠还没有触发捕鼠器，所以它的状态还是 打开 的。因此该程序可以进行改进，这都是非常典型的。

开关

总的来说，捕鼠器就是一个开关。你会在家里使用开关打开灯。可以从开关中获得许多信息。比如，人们会从你家灯的状态了解到你是否在家。

你可以根据邻居家灯的状态来改变行为。如果邻居家所有的灯都熄灭了，那么请关掉你大声的音乐，因为人们可能已经上床睡觉了。

CPU 也使用这样的逻辑，只不过乘以几个数量级，缩小到了微观级别。当 CPU 在特定寄存器上接收到电信号时，可以触发其他一些寄存器，然后触发另一个，以此类推。如果这些寄存器有特定的意义，那么就可以通信。也许激活同一主板上某处的芯片，或者使 LED 亮起，或者改变屏幕上的像素颜色。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Linux Lite 6.2 是一个理想的升级，带来一些有用的变化，没什么太花哨的东西。




Linux Lite 是一种流行的轻量级的类 Windows 发行版，为用户提供了一个熟悉的操作系统感受。

最新版本 Linux Lite 6.2 基于 Ubuntu 22.04 LTS，对 UI 进行了各种更改以及各种错误的修复。

Linux Lite 6.2：有什么新功能？



此版本的 Linux Lite 侧重于用户界面调整和错误修复，并对一些应用程序进行了更改。

一些主要亮点包括：


更新的图标

新壁纸

Shotcut 视频编辑器

删除微软 Teams

LibreOffice 7.3.6.2

Linux 内核 5.15


Shotcut 取代 OpenShot



是的，Shotcut 现在取代了 OpenShot，成为 Linux Lite 6.2 上的默认视频编辑器。

OpenShot 之所以被删除，是因为它不能很好地与 Ubuntu 22.04 配合使用，而如果没有一个好用的视频编辑器，用户将不得不自己寻找一个。

Shotcut 无疑是一款出色的视频编辑器。所以，应该是一个不错的选择。

微软 Teams 已删除

另一个重大变化是微软 Teams 不再包含在发行版中。

其原因是微软停止了 Linux 应用程序，转而支持一个渐进式 Web 应用程序版本。

我们之前的报道可以让你更深入地了解：


微软决定放弃 Teams 的 Linux 应用，代之以渐进式Web应用


更新的图标和新壁纸



Linux Lite 6.2 具有最新的 Papirus 图标集以及一系列新的 Linux Lite 主题壁纸。

这应该会给发行版带来用户可能喜欢的焕然一新的外观。

🛠️ 其他更改和改进



其他值得注意的变化包括：


任务管理器的更新

改进了 Lite 升级应用程序中的结束对话。

各种应用程序的最新更新、错误修复等。


你可以阅读完整的发行说明以 了解更多信息。

Linux Lite 6.2 看起来是对以前版本的令人满意的升级，有许多重大的变化和补充。

📥 下载 Linux Lite 6.2

你可以从其官方网站下载最新的 ISO 或使用 Lite 升级工具升级到它。


Linux Lite 6.2


💬 你如何看待 Linux Lite 6.2？愿意试一试吗？

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Somewhat pissed, a tiny bit laughing. I don't usually post, just lurk. After going through all that, I just want to vent a bit. I suggest you read this before going in. This is my personal addition of several issues that I had, which made me almost quit Windows, even though I couldn't.
 I saw the top post somewhat earlier today. Didn't think much of it. I knew that I had a Windows 10 installation due for later this day. Whatever. I've installed Linux. Windows is usually pre-installed so I've never dealt with the process fully.
 It wasn't pleasant. Cortana exists as a veil to what lies underneath. The installation process took 15 minutes or so. Then, after all that, to my sense of humor's delight in anti-climactic irony, it boots into Recovery Mode with error code 0x000000e. After tinkering with boot options I was able to boot from the USB and wiped the drive.
 Now it just goes into diagnostics mode. Great. More work.
 -
 I'm tired of Microsoft's mess. Can't we just have a peaceful install process? Can Windows Update work fine without any issues? I wanted to add my thoughts as too many straws have been broken. Unfortunately, as I work in drafting, almost every CAD software is only available for Windows. Linux was a breeze for most of the time I've used it. If I mess up, I know or understand why and I'm able to backtrack, at least on certain distributions. Whenever Windows fails, it just seems like a brick-wall unless I talk to someone whose entire IT repertoire is diagnosing Windows.

But after a recent re-install of the system I took a moment to take a break until I finish my post-install shell script, which I'm planning to extend with facilities that would enable me to add custom search engines to the browser, testing the default Firefox for this purpose.
 But you can imagine my surprise when I could NOT find such a built-in option in Firefox other than adding them via extensions. But come on guys, it's been a widely known and I assume a popular option in V8-based browsers for ages, I don't even remember when they introduced this functionality so long ago it was. After all, a regular user like me may not find the search engine extensions published on Mozilla web-store satisfactory or even there at all...
 I was thinking about sticking with Firefox after re-install. But now I have to reconsider this option, alas...
 REALLY REALLY SURPRISED! Or, am I so blind not to see the obvious?! Please correct me if I'm wrong.

held in Berlin on October 5 and 6, 2022. The main goal of this summit was to
agree on common concepts and tooling for how to build, deploy, and run modern,
secure, image-based Linux distributions — a project that that the organizers,
Christian Brauner, Luca Boccassi, and Lennart Poettering, have been working on
for some time.  The result was a more refined vision of how Linux systems
can be built and deployed securely.]]></summary>

1.65.0 of the Rust language has been released.  Improvements include
generic associated types, a new let...else statement, and the
ability to break from labeled blocks:


	Plain block expressions can now be labeled as a break
	target, terminating that block early. This may sound a little like
	a goto statement, but it's not an arbitrary jump, only
	from within a block to its end. This was already possible with
	loop blocks, and you may have seen people write loops that
	always execute only once, just to get a labeled break.]]></summary>

For people who like to plan their time, it is tough to be realistic about what work you can get done without a calendar showing you how much time you can invest in your tasks. But it is hard to organize this because there is so much context-switching due to tasks coming from different apps—not to mention "unstructured" sources like email, notes taken during a meeting, a message on Slack, etc..
I’m that type of user—for me, my calendar has always been the ‘primary source of truth’. But the user experience was terrible. I had to keep to-do lists on the side of another app and manually turn my tasks into…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[近日，赛迪顾问软件与信息服务业研究中心通过广泛调研，编制完成了《中国服务器操作系统市场研究报告（2022H1）》（以下简称“报告”）。报告从市场规模、市场结构和市场特点三方面对 2022 年上半年中国服务器操作系统市场发展情况进行了分析，并从国内产业生态的角度切入，深入分析了现阶段 openEuler 生态的发展情况。当前，以 openEuler 为代表的中国开源社区正在构建以自主技术为核心的产业生态，国产服务器操作系统已经具备产品有开发者社区、有知识产权，高安全、高可用、可定制、可重构的特性。

此前，在工业和信息化部举行的“新时代工业和信息化发展”系列主题新闻发布会上，信息技术发展司相关负责人在答记者问时，表示：“支持成立国内首家开源基金会——开放原子开源基金会，加速孵化开放鸿蒙、欧拉等一批开源项目，推动开源代码托管平台发展，优化壮大开源社区，如欧拉开源社区用户数量超 60 万人，合作单位超 380 家。在服务器操作系统方面，推动服务器操作系统与主流 CPU、数据库、中间件等软硬件的兼容适配，加快提高产品国际竞争力。如，欧拉操作系统终端部署量超 170 万套。”肯定了当前时期国内操作系统产品和生态取得的成就。

报告选取了政府、运营商、金融、能源四大行业市场逐一分析，并对中国服务器操作系统未来的发展趋势进行了研判。赛迪顾问业务总监高丹在 2022 开放原子全球开源峰会 openEuler 分论坛上对报告内容和数据进行了发布和披露。

报告显示，从整体市场来看，2022 年上半年中国服务器操作系统装机量继续高速增长，较上年同期增长 11.7%，达 195.9 万套。



从 openEuler 生态来看，openEuler 系产品（社区版、商业发行版和企业自用版）市场继续保持高速发展态势，2022 年上半年 openEuler 系产品整体装机量达 67 万套，自欧拉开源社区成立（2019 年 12 月）以来，openEuler 系产品总装机量达 172 万套。可以说，openEuler 的全面开源，引发了中国服务器操作系统发展“质”的变化，推动者整个行业进入加速发展阶段。



同时，伴随产品在市场中的稳定表现，openEuler 系产品市场装机量在 2022 年继续突破，取得了多个领域的增速第一：在政府行业，openEuler 系产品在 2022 年上半年市场占有率达 39.2%，位居第一位；在运营商行业，市场占有率达 57.9%；在金融行业，装机量市场占有率达 28.0%，位居第二；在能源行业，市场份额进一步提升，占有率达 29.6%。

openEuler 还通过开源社区的建设，将芯片厂商、整机厂商、操作系统厂商、应用软件厂商等多类伙伴集合到社区中，社区成员实现共建、共享、共治，全球资源逐渐向社区汇聚，从而推动了整个产业链条的发展。同时，随着数字经济建设的不但推进，openEuler 着力建设数字基础设施的底座，通过不断与云计算、边缘计算等结合，提供对数字场景的支持。截至目前，openEuler 社区伙伴已超 380 家，全国下载量超 50 万，用户数量超 60 万人，PR（拉取请求（Pull Request））合入超 5.5 万。

从兼容性来看，openEuler 已完成与多个硬件厂商的兼容适配，通过了 CPU 架构（x86/ARM）、跨代 CPU、主板（USB/拓扑）、外设等房名的兼容性测试。



2019 年 openEuler 宣布开源，2021 年宣布全新升级，欧拉操作系统可覆盖从 IT、CT 到 OT 数字基础设施全场景，并于 2022 年推出首个数字基础设施全场景长周期版本。当前，大量的生态伙伴已经积极加入到 openEuler 开源社区的建设当中，欧拉真正实现了由企业主导向产业共建。未来，openEuler 社区将持续与全产业链伙伴一起，共建、共享、共治，打造全球首选的数字基础设施开源操作系统。]]></summary>

But are there any 32-bit apps that specifically require the 486 that won't run on a newer 32-bit compatible CPU? For example in the case of Wine or a VM. The kernel is responsible for ultimately executing those 486 instructions right?

Our users are web developers, and a prominent and adjacent pain point for our users is authorization. Developers typically implement two independent solutions for authentication and authorization. Offering AuthN and AuthZ in a single solution is something we’ve been thinking about for the last few years.
Quick primer, authentication is knowing who the user is, and authorization is knowing what the user has access to. A physical analogy: A person enters a building.
