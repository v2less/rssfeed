 https://i.imgur.com/9buiHmy.png
 The actual ram usage is about 10 GiB, which is what top, fastfetch and free -gh are reporting, but htop is reporting 6.5 GiB? Why is that? I also tried launching htop with its default config and I still get the same issue.
 This is the first time this has ever happened btw.

It turns out it's sending GPS, cell phone tower cell IDs and Wifi beacon data to servers in Hong Kong and mainland China on a continued basis. Google and Apple app store pages say no personal data is collected or sent to 3rd parties.
Hopefully readers pick up a few tips on reversing apps for their connected devices.

to the many criticisms aimed at the company since it changed its policy
regarding RHEL source code.


	Ultimately, we do not find value in a RHEL rebuild and we are not
	under any obligation to make things easier for rebuilders; this is
	our call to make. That brings me to CentOS Stream, of which there
	is immense confusion. I acknowledge that this is a change in a
	longstanding tradition where we went above and beyond, and change
	like this can cause some confusion. That confusion manifested as
	accusations about us going closed-source and about alleged GPL
	violations. There is CentOS Stream the binary deliverable, and
	CentOS Stream the source repository. The CentOS Stream
	gitlab source is where we build RHEL releases, in the open for
	all to see. To call RHEL “closed source” is categorically untrue
	and inaccurate. CentOS Stream moves faster than RHEL, so it might
	not be on HEAD, but the code is there. If you can’t find it, it’s a
	bug – please let us know.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[today is my 32nd birthday. and before I get to my question I want to quickly talk about myself. I have a micro-enterprise which sells Linux/digital security courses etc. I also have a youtube channel that talks about linux with more than 30k subscribers which generates me a small income of 120 dolars.
 I work remotely from home and this is how I keep my self, my wife and 4 kids.
 I need suggestions and tips for my first job in the sysadmin area. I have a good experience with linux and I've been a user since 2005, I've always been a lot of tinkering and I use distributions like gentoo/slackware. I have good knowledge in Shell Scripts and backup schemes. I keep some VPS with Debian/Centos (deceased)/Slackware with the most varied services like moodle, irc, libreddit, email (postfix), tor, elog and anything else that comes to mind.
 And today on my birthday I woke up very determined to work in the area (for real). A lot, I love this area, I love the command line, I love configuration files. Some details: * I am fully self-taught * I don't have college * I have several courses on udemy (I don't know if it helps) * I'm autistic, and linux is my hyperfocus since 2005, I love it deeply. * I like to write documentation and organize scripts etc...
 A peculiar detail is that, as I am autistic, I cannot work outside the home, that is, it needs to be remotely because I cannot go out and be locked up somewhere (I have panic attacks)
 english Well, what would be your tip to put on my resume?
 I am Brazilian.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey Reddit community,
 I'm in a dilemma and need your advice. I'm looking for a Linux distribution that prioritizes bug fixes and provides quick security updates without focusing too much on additional features. After some research, I've narrowed down my options to Fedora and Ubuntu LTS, but I'm having trouble deciding which one would be the better choice.
 On one hand, Fedora is known for its cutting-edge nature and frequent updates, which could potentially mean faster bug fixes and security patches. However, the rapid pace of development may also introduce new bugs or stability issues.
 On the other hand, Ubuntu LTS (Long Term Support) versions are designed to provide a stable and reliable experience over an extended period. They prioritize bug fixes and security updates while minimizing major changes, making them ideal for users who value stability.
 Considering my primary focus on bug fixes and quick security updates, which distribution do you think would be the better choice for me? Have you had any personal experiences with either Fedora or Ubuntu LTS regarding their maintenance and support?
 I appreciate any insights, opinions, or personal experiences you can share to help me make an informed decision. Thanks in advance!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I worked on a web service that allows you to import a song and define a target length that the song will be shortened or lengthened to. It does this by analyzing the song and finding repeating audio patterns. This is helpful for making any song match a video or performance with a set duration. You can also specify areas of the song to prefer or avoid. An example is available here: https://mofi.loud.red/edit/8bd3fdf780f8c3927e41029f3b957f8a7...
The cool thing is that after the song is analyzed on the server, the client can recompute and preview the results completely client-side through an implementation that uses Web Workers and WebAssembly. The audio previewing uses Tone.js. I am thinking of writing up some more details about the implementation in the future.
I'm still working on a way to explain this easily, but I like the idea of carrying over the concept of content-aware fill from images to audio.
Please let me know if you have any comments or questions!

英伟达最新 GPU 黑市价格翻番

去年，美国商务部阻止了包括英伟达和 AMD 在内的美国顶级硬件公司向中国和俄罗斯出售其最先进的芯片。其中，英伟达的 A100 和 H100 GPU 属于出口管制的对象。这导致这些芯片在黑市的价格达到了 2 万美元，比正常价格高一倍，并且没有保修和支持。


消息来源：The Register



老王点评：现在 AI 对 GPU 的需求非常迫切，这可比挖矿那时候对 GPU 的需求更紧迫。




NFC 将变得更强

负责制定近场通讯规范的 NFC 论坛公布了到 2028 年的主要计划和研究工作。主要的五个方面包括：NFC 无线充电的功率将从 1 瓦提升到 3 瓦；连接范围将从 5 毫米提升四到六倍；支持多用途轻触；使支持 NFC 手机具有 POS 功能；能够分享其成分和产品回收方式的数据。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Apologies but asking here as /r/linuxquestions is still locked.
 I work for a private ISP, we sell managed networks to customers with various services. I have a VMware ESXi server, and to simplify things let's say it currently has 10 VMs, each VM having a management NIC, and a customer VLAN NIC. Currently I can use a service like NRPE to execute commands on each VM, and NRPE runs a networking command (like a cURL, ping, or similar) over the customer network NIC. The NRPE agent listens on the management NIC, but executes the commands over the customer VLAN NIC.
 Customer wise, for simplicity we'll say customers are called Customer1, Customer2, Customer3, and so on. Their VLANs correspond like 10, 20, 30, and so on. Each customer network has an identical IP space of 10.0.0.0/8, and the IP of this VM will be identical in each of the networks.
 I'm building a new VM which has a single management NIC, and a single trunk NIC (VLAN 4095 in VMware parlance). I've tested configuring the secondary NIC on the VM as Customer1 with VLAN 10 tagged, and that works fine (so the port is all good), but I'm having trouble with network namespaces. My end goal is to be able to run commands like ip netns exec customer1 ping 8.8.8.8 and get the results (quick crap example, but you get the idea).
 I tried to borrow the principles from this article but it wouldn't work for me. 
 Update: Now resolved thanks to /u/J4yD4n suggestion of splitting the trunk interface in to separate per-VLAN subints and then attaching namespaces to them individually.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[开发人员可以通过将开源软件集成到其代码库中，节省时间并避免重复发明轮子。然而，这也带来了严重的许可侵权风险。你必须遵守适用于重新使用的开源代码的众多开源许可证之一。如果你不这样做，你（或你所在公司）有可能因违反开源许可证条款而被起诉。即使这种诉讼并不普遍发生，它们确实存在。实际上，考虑到现在许多开源项目由希望保护其在开源社区中的投资的企业运营，这种情况在未来可能更加频繁发生。

1、熟悉开源许可证

了解开源许可证是防止开源许可侵权问题中最重要的一步。很容易认为所有开源许可证都施加相同的条件，或者它们都基本要求源代码的持续可用性。实际上，有数十种不同的开源许可证，它们都有着非常不同的条款。简单地认为只要你从一个开源项目获取代码，你可以随意使用它并保持源代码可访问，这是一个严重的错误。几个开源许可证的一个典型但经常被忽视的条件可能是需要向原始作者提供致谢。

2、记录你使用的开源内容

建立一个标准化的方法来记录你使用开源代码的情况是一个优秀的做法。导入模块或从 GitHub 粘贴代码并不难。但如果你不追踪代码来自何处以及使用了何种许可证，你可能会忘记在代码库中如何以及在哪里集成开源内容。此外，如果你在借用代码时无法证明自己遵守了有效的许可条件，那么在开源许可证发生变化时可能会产生问题。考虑在文档维基（如果有的话）中添加一个页面，列出你使用的开源代码，以避免出现这个问题。每当你包含开源组件或依赖时，至少在你自己的源代码中添加注释。

3、避免使用未经授权的开源组件

有时，你可能会偶然发现一个隐藏的 GitHub 存储库或其他源代码托管位置，其中包含你希望使用的代码，但没有提到任何许可指南。你可能会认为代码的创建者希望让其成为开源代码，并且你可以根据自己的意愿使用它。但这是一个危险的假设。开发人员可能会后续对代码设置特定的许可条件，并要求你遵守这些条件，这可能导致未来产生许可侵权的指控。除非你有非常充分的理由，否则避免使用缺乏明确许可限制的模糊代码。

4、创建自己的开源代码

将你自己的软件完全开源是减少与开源许可相关风险的一种方法。这意味着你将自动遵守任何要求保留派生源代码的开源许可条件。然而，请记住，仅仅开放你自己的代码并不能确保完全遵守许可证。你仍然需要努力确保你遵守每个许可证的规定，因为适用于你借用的代码的许可证可能与你选择的开源许可证不同。然而，你无需担心与源代码共享相关的任何条款。

5、自动检测开源组件

虽然在代码库内手动跟踪你如何使用开源是很好的做法，但通过使用能够自动识别开源组件和依赖项的软件，你可以降低出错的可能性。在这里，我们应该考虑两种不同类型的工具。一种是源代码组成分析（SCA）软件，它会自动扫描源代码并识别从值得信任的外部来源获取的元素。另一种是软件供应链管理解决方案，除其他功能外，还支持查找和监控应用程序堆栈中的任何开源依赖项。

API 网关是一个单一节点，提供对 API 调用入口。网关聚合了所请求的服务，并相应传回合适的响应信息。为了令你的 API 网关有效地工作，设计一个可靠、高效且简洁地 API 至关重要。本文介绍一种设计风格，但只要你理解其中的重点内容，它就能解决你的相关问题。

由 API 主导的方法

API 主导的方法是将 API 置于应用程序和它们需要访问的业务能力之间的通信核心，从而在所有数字通道上一致地交付无缝功能。API 主导的连接是指使用一种可重用、且设计得当的 API 来连接数据和应用程序的方法。

API 主导的架构

API 主导的架构是一种架构方法，它着眼于实现重用 API 的最佳方式。它能解决以下问题：


保护 API，使外界无法在未授权情况下访问 API

确保应用程序能找到正确的 API 端点

限制对 API 的请求次数，从而确保持续的可用性

支持持续集成、测试、生命周期管理、监控、运维等等

防止错误在栈间传播

对 API 的实时监测和分析

实现可伸缩和灵活的业务能力（例如支持 微服务 架构）


API 资源路由

实现一个 API 网关，把它作为与所有服务通信的单一入口点，意味着使用者只需要知道 URL 就能使用 API。将请求路由到相应的服务端点，并执行相应的功能是 API 网关的职责。



由于客户端应用程序不需要从多个 HTTP 端点调用功能，这个办法就减少了 API 使用者的操作复杂度。对每个服务来说，也不需实现一个单独的层级去实现认证、授权、节流和速度限制。大多数API 网关，如开源的 Apache APISIX，已经包含了这些核心功能。

API 基于内容的路由

基于内容的路由机制也使用 API 网关根据请求的内容进行路由调用。…]]></summary>

春天时，听完了杰森·萨默的《什穆尔的桥：跟随我的幸存者父亲回访奥斯维辛》的有声书。再读实体书时，已是初秋。
新冠的第三个夏天太美丽，忙着旅行、享用花草瓜果，不宜也不应该阅读这样严肃、凝重的书。疫情虽然没有结束，但世界上大部分地区的人们都恢复了从前夏天的活动。最明显的，便是旅行。回故乡，或是就地重逢，或是前往陌生的远方。旅行，是人们制造或者寻找记忆的地方。
然而，一进9月，天气转凉，空气似乎也便凝重了起来。9月18日，美国公共广播电台（PBS）上播出了知名纪录片制作人肯·伯恩斯的纪录片《美国和大屠杀》（United States and the Holocaust），三集，六个小时。九·一八，中国人自然会想起“从那个悲惨的时候”。
记住回忆。
大屠杀：读不完的书，看不完的电影
第一次接触大屠杀题材，看的是梅丽尔·斯特里普主演的四集电视剧《大屠杀》。那之后不久，在长江航船上读到了《安妮·弗兰克日记》。在美国读书期间，去欧洲参加过一次上海前犹太居民的会议，从那次会议上，第一次听幸存者的后代说，他们很多人没有见过自己的祖父母。“大屠杀”这个题目，一下子具体化了，变成了家族树上断裂的链条。
以色列作家阿摩司·奥兹在他的回忆录《爱与黑暗的故事》(A Tale of Love and Darkness)中，生动地描写了母亲的出生地，位于乌克兰境内的罗夫诺，却一直不愿意前往访问。后来，他的女儿范尼亚·奥兹代他前往。他的小说《轻抚水，轻抚风》（Touch the Water, Touch the Wind），对在德国文化中侵染多年，却一夜之间沦为流亡者，在黑暗的森林中藏匿逃生的犹太青年充满了温柔的同情。

沈周（1427-1509）作为吴门画派的领袖名闻于当时，“评者谓为明世第一”（《明史》卷二九八）；但他不仅是画家，也是隐士，既不参加科考，亦拒绝征召，终生未仕。与传统的离群索居、遗世高蹈的隐者形象不同，沈周一生雅集不断，应酬频繁，弟子文徵明在《沈先生行状》中记载：“晚岁名益盛，客至亦益多，户屦常满。先生既老，而聪明不衰，酬对终日，不少厌怠。风流文物，照映一时。”（《甫田集》卷二十五）沈周隐居的有竹居，不像安静的世外桃源，更似热闹的文化中心，“每黎明，门未辟，舟已塞乎其港矣。先生固喜客，至则相与䜩笑咏歌，出古图书器物，摸抚品题，酬对终日不厌”（王鏊《石田先生墓志铭》）。沈周的交游对象，当然也不仅仅是布衣山人、方外僧道，各种地方官员乃至馆阁诸公，都与其过从甚密。虽然沈周自称“酷爱林泉图上见，生憎官府酒边谈”（《市隐》），但他并不排斥政治，回避官员，甚至主动与官员交接。当下的研究者几乎都注意到了这一点，认为沈周与官宦的交往对提高其声誉、传播其作品起了重要作用。但是这种交游是如何影响沈周在美术与文学上的具体创作，在吴门画派的崛起过程中又有何作用？涉及者尚寥寥无几。

沈周《沧洲趣图》卷（局部）

沈周作为吴门画派创始人，是美术界关注的热点，仅在“中国知网”数据库中以“沈周”为标题进行检索，近十年（2012-2022）来平均每年都有三十篇以上的论文发布，其中秦晓磊博士先后发表的《与邑作奇观——沈周、文徵明笔下的虞山古桧》（《故宫博物院学刊》2018年第2期）、《李东阳对沈周绘画的鉴藏——兼论北京文官与沈周的互动》（《中国国家博物馆馆刊》2018年第7期）、《沈周〈庐墓图〉与茔域山水画》（《文艺研究》2018年第11期）、《沈周〈沧洲趣图〉的意涵、年代及接受者》（《美术》2019年第6…]]></summary>

 I’m aware I can write a sh script that loops over the session names as the arguments (eg. for session in $@), BUT the problem is this doesn’t allow for Tab autocompletion of the session name. Since my session names are pretty long/specific , having this would be super helpful.
 Any thoughts on how to resolve this are appreciated. Thank you!

 I tried to log into Chase.com, and saw it gave me a "we've enhanced our platform" error on ARM when it allows x86 Linux fine.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Linus has released the 6.4 kernel.


	Most of the stuff in my mailbox the last week has been about
	upcoming things for 6.5, and I already have 15 pull requests
	pending. I appreciate all you proactive people.

	But that's for tomorrow. Today we're all busy build-testing the
	newest kernel release, and checking that it's all good. Right?


Headline features in this release include:
generic iterators for BPF,
the removal of the SELinux runtime disable
knob,
the removal of the SLOB memory allocator,
linear address masking support on Intel
CPUs,
process-level samepage merging control,
support for user trace events,
more infrastructure for writing kernel modules in Rust,
per-VMA locks,
and much more.
See the LWN merge-window summaries (part 1, part 2), and the (in-progress) KernelNewbies 6.4 page for
the details.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When watching a live stream on youtube you can watch current events, or rewind to the past to watch what has happened 1,5 hour ago.
 I want to setup a home monitoring service. I want a similar service, for myself, on my own server with public IP. I know Linux. I have a raspberrypi connected to network that I want to stream video from home to my server.
 I looked into "restreamer", but I think it streams a stream to other services only and has no history. Right now, I try to setup "avideo" (or "youphptube") inside ubuntu docker container with mixed success.
 Is there an application to allow presenting a video stream via a web page (or anything else that will work on android) with the functionality of rewinding to the past and recording everything to a directory?
 If I understand, when I set up nginx with rtmp it can stream the stream. And the stream is recorded to a directory. But to watch "what has happened 2 hours ago" I have to open the directory where the stream is recorded and download a file and watch it. I want it to work like youtube. Just click 2 hours ago on the video. How do I do that?
 Thanks.

 I'm having a bit of an issue with Plymouth. I'm running the code below for a theme, however scaling the images seem to make the whole script lag really bad. 
 There isn't much documentation available so I'm not sure what I'm doing wrong or why scaling these images would make it lag. As I understand it it only scales them once per image then is plays them but maybe I'm wrong, I don't know. 
 ```
 Window.SetBackgroundTopColor(0.234, 0.43, 0.705); Window.SetBackgroundBottomColor(0.16, 0.25, 0.44);
 window_width = Window.GetWidth(); window_height = Window.GetHeight();
 intro_index = 0; load_index = 0; max_intro = 37; max_load = 20;
 index = 0; while (1){ intro[index] = Image("IntroAnim" + index + ".png"); intro[index].Scale(window_width, window_height); if (index > max_intro) break; index++; }
 index = 0; while (1){ load[index] = Image("LoadAnim" + index + ".png"); load[index].Scale(window_width, window_height); if (index > max_load) break; index++; }
 sprite = Sprite();
 fun refresh (){ if (intro_index <= max_intro) { sprite.SetImage(intro[intro_index]); } if (intro_index > max_intro) { sprite.SetImage(load[load_index]); } intro_index++; load_index = (load_index + 1) % max_load; }

 Logging in using sddm or any other DM, both monitors flicker for maybe half a second.
 Starting an application from the launcher, nothing happens. Switch to terminal to see what's up. Solved in a couple of google searches. 
 And some more little tiny annoyances.
 It's nothing, basically. I love Linux, everything works. But the experience just isn't smooth. Everything "works". 
 Will those annoyances go away if I use Debian or OpenSUSE Leap? Maybe you can tell. To me there's always some thing I have to fix. Maybe that's why I love Linux.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey HN, I didn't want my Gateway 4DX2-66 from 1993 to be left out of the AI revolution, so I built an AI Assistant for Windows 3.1, based on the OpenAI API.
The most interesting parts of building this were:
- Getting TLS 1.2 and 1.3 working on Windows 3.1 so that WinGPT could directly connect to OpenAI's server without relying on a modern machine for TLS termination.
- Learning about the memory segmentation architecture on 16-bit Windows, including the difference between far and near pointers.
- Building the UI in plain C code with the Windows API and limited selection of controls in Windows 3.1.
You can check it out here and learn more about what it was like to build it: https://www.dialup.net/wingpt/

 Let's be honest, one of the most common complaints i see about snaps other than load times are the fact that there's only one repository to pull packages from. And that's more than often commonly listed as the sole reason why flatpaks are "apparently" better.
 So why is it that flathub is the only repo that's list in every distro's documentation to enable? ArchwikiDebianGentoo
 In fact, it's also the only repo I see that has applications added to it. here's the breakdown on numbers. First here's how to find this pout yourself so lets enable the big three repo's that I've come across from stalking /r/flatpak

According to Wikipedia distros like EuroLinux are opposed to the idea of software patens which makes me think that they would also be against the idea of RedHat legally bending the GPL (at least in the US) though a license agreement in their favour.

 I've been looking for about a week in researching this, running a multitude of config files, commands & installing programs that was recommended by other users on wiks/forums.
 I've reinstalled so many times after just messing up the audio system and it would never boot or hear any audio.
 Tired Pulsewave, pipewire doing different configs, no dice.
 Is there anyone out there who have similar setup or the knowhow to this, Can you assist please :)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi HN, I recently created and published an open-source resume builder as a weekend project. The idea came to me while I was mentoring students and noticing common mistakes they made in their resumes that I had also made in the past. I thought to build a tool to help people easily create a modern professional resume with built-in best practices to avoid those mistakes.
Top highlights of the resume builder are:
1. Real time UI update as you type
2. ATS friendly to top ATS platforms, e.g. Greenhouse, Lever
3. Privacy focus - no sign up is required and data is stored locally in browser that only users have access
4. Support import from existing resume PDF
The tool also includes a resume parser to help people test their existing resumes’ ATS readability if they might not be interested in using the builder. I also explained the parser algorithm in an article with interactive tables that might be an interesting read to see the steps and logics it uses (https://www.open-resume.com/resume-parser).
I hope others might find this tool useful and I look forward to hearing any feedback the community has. Thanks all.

 I mostly ignore them, unless there is something to share that may help someone else.Please note, this is not a "problem", I'd just like to hear some opinions.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[数百万 GitHub 项目易受依赖库劫持攻击

安全专家发现，数以百万计的 GitHub 项目易受依赖库劫持攻击，攻击者可以借此发动影响大量用户的供应链攻击。GitHub 上的用户名和项目或库的名字如果改变，为了避免破坏其它项目的依赖关系，GitHub 会创建一个重定向。但如果有人用旧的名字创建了账号，那么就会导致重定向无效。GitHub 可以防御部分此类攻击，但该防御方案可以被绕过。


消息来源：Aqua Sec



老王点评：我觉得 GitHub 应该更认真的解决这个问题，毕竟 GitHub 已经不仅仅是一个代码仓库，而是一个供应链的重要组成部分了。但从另外一个角度看，软件项目依赖这种不确定的供应链是不是也过于宽松了？




美国新数据显示，在家工作成为新常态

许多在大流行期间蜷缩在家里的白领工人已经回到办公室，但没有回到办公室的人特别多。对许多人来说，远程工作似乎是一种新常态。周四公布的美国经济数据显示，在家工作似乎已经成为一种趋势，特别是对女性和受过大学教育的人而言。2022 年的数据显示，34% 的 15 岁以上的人仍然在家里工作，54% 的人拥有学士或更高的学位。而美国旧金山市长已经 提议 将市中心荒废的购物中心改造为足球场，因为越来越多人不再回到市中心上班，旧金山的办公室空置率已达到 30 年来的最高水平。


消息来源：MSN



老王点评：不知道为什么美国人就不回去上班了，而我们似乎都赶紧回去了。




Firewalld 2.0 发布

开源防火墙守护程序 Firewalld 自 2011 年以来一直在开发，而两年前才达到 Firewalld 1.0 的里程碑。因此，发现 Firewalld 2.0 在今天发布有点令人惊讶。2.0 中最重要的变化解决了区域漂移的问题，即防火墙策略可能最终违反了 “数据包只进入一个区域” 的规则。此外，还增加了对 NFTables Flowtable 的支持，可以显著提高转发性能，将网络转发的 iperf 性能提高了约 59%。


消息来源：Phoronix



老王点评：看起来是 Firewalld 的开发在加速，不过我更觉得它是在飙版本号。看看 Firefox、Linux 内核等开源软件的版本号，看来开源软件对版本号的谦虚传统已经被丢弃了。]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[在本文中，我们将逐步向你展示如何在 Kubernetes（k8s）集群上安装 Ansible AWX。


Ansible AWX 是一个强大的开源工具，用于管理和自动化 IT 基础设施。AWX 为 Ansible 提供图形用户界面，使你可以轻松创建、安排和运行 Ansible 剧本Playbook。

另一方面，Kubernetes 是一种流行的容器编排平台，广泛用于部署和管理容器化应用。

先决条件：


Kubernetes 集群

Kubectl

具有 sudo 权限和集群管理员权限的普通用户

互联网连接


步骤 1：安装 Helm

如果你的系统上安装了 Helm，则在命令下运行以进行安装，

$ curl -fsSL -o get_helm.sh https://raw.githubusercontent.com/helm/helm/main/scripts/get-helm-3
$ chmod +x get_helm.sh
$ ./get_helm.sh
$ helm version




步骤 2：安装 AWX chart

在 Kubernetes 上安装 AWX 的最简单方法是使用 AWX Helm “海图chart”。因此，要通过 “海图” 安装 AWX，首先使用以下 helm 命令添加仓库。（LCTT 译注：Kubernetes 生态中大量使用了和航海有关的比喻，因此本文在翻译时也采用了这些比喻）

$ helm repo add awx-operator https://ansible.github.io/awx-operator/
"awx-operator" has been added to your repositories
$


注意：如果你之前已经添加过此仓库，请在命令下运行以…]]></summary>

加布里埃尔·伊根（Gabriel Egan）先生是英国德蒙福特大学教授、国际知名莎学专家，也是《新版牛津莎士比亚全集》的四位总编辑之一。《全集》前四卷已出版，分别是《现代评论版》《研究参考版》（两卷）和《作者身份溯源》；后两卷是《剧目别本》，将在2023-2024年出版。杨英军先生应《上海书评》之邀，借莎翁第一对开本出版四百年之机采访了伊根教授，请他谈了《新版牛津莎士比亚全集》的编纂及莎学研究的最新进展。

《新版牛津莎士比亚全集》书影

作为《新版牛津莎士比亚全集》（The New Oxford Shakespeare Complete Works）的四位总编辑之一，您已经付出了十多年的心血。您能跟读者分享一下最新进展吗？《全集》能否按计划在2023年完成？
伊根：《新版牛津莎士比亚全集》（以下简称《全集》）是国际莎学同行协力合作的项目，担任总编辑的还有佛罗里达州立大学的加里·泰勒（Gary Taylor）教授，伯明翰大学的约翰·乔维特（John Jowett）教授，印第安纳大学的特里·柏鲁斯（Terri Bourus）教授。
整套《全集》一共六卷，我们已经出版了四卷。第一卷是《全集：现代评论版》（The New Oxford Shakespeare: Modern Critical Edition）。这是面向二十一世纪读者的全集，我们对文本全部做了规范化的处理，以满足当代读者的期待，主要是将莎士比亚时代的拼写和标点符号加以校勘和更新，其中的表演选项提示（Performance Notes）是我们的创新，目标是帮助演员更好地呈现莎剧的艺术完整性。更多的注释是为了帮助读者更好地欣赏其中的戏剧和诗歌。
我们还出版了两卷《全集：研究参考版》（The New Oxford Shakespeare: Critical Reference Edition…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So I'm curently using Windows 7, don't care, it's fine, it runs everything I want and need, I don't keep any data I need go keep private about on my PC. The only problem is Steam dropping support for Windows 7.
 And I'm not switching to the garbage that is Windows 10, and especially not Windows 10 the sequel, aka 11.
 The problem why I never used Linux for gaming, is that most of my ancient games from the 90s, early 2000s just won't run on any Linux distro I tried. To be fair most of them barely run on Windows 7 but I can make it work with some fiddling. And I want my new rig to run everything, so I don't need two seperate PCs for running different eras of games.
 But that was years ago when I last tried it, maybe there are some improvements made to run old Windows software? Plus points if a distro has a super outdated UI and looks ancient.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Here is a video: https://youtu.be/cyWu_pHwqNg
 InkBox OS is a fully-functional operating system for some Kobo and Kindle eReader devices. It has pretty much been built from scratch, except for the base system which consists of Alpine Linux 3.10 (the reason why we use such an old version is because not all devices run a recent enough kernel to handle libc that weren't built for them). Most of the scripts, system initialization and graphical user interface programs were written from the ground up, though.
 I hope that you will enjoy it if you are able to try it!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Working from a personal PC has the downside of being responsible for its availability, regardless of what happens, as well as ensuring its safety against any invasion. Currently, my approach is as follows:
 ​
  
Having a Linux PC for work.
 
Using separate email accounts for different purposes.
 
Using secure passwords for each account.
 
Using one browser for confidential tasks and another for non-confidential tasks.
 
Avoiding logging in with confidential emails on unsafe devices.
 
Never saving or copying passwords.
 
Not sharing the number used for two-step authentication with work colleagues.
 
Providing fake personal information on each email account, such as a mother's name.
 
Avoiding the installation of unknown repositories, programs, or scripts.
 
 ​
 That covers the safety aspect.
 ​
 To ensure reliability, I always keep an external HD on hand that I can quickly use for work in case anything goes wrong with my work PC.
 ​
 I'm considering what else I could do. I've heard that password management apps are very secure, and some even offer two-step authentication. Additionally, syncing a folder to Google Drive might be the best way to ensure uninterrupted access to important data, regardless of any issues. However, I'm unsure if encrypting the HD has any downsides, such as decreased read/write speed or the risk of data loss due to errors.
 ​
 Ideally, for a reliable and safe scenario, it would be convenient to have all data saved in the cloud without the associated risks.
 ​
 What are your thoughts?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So, I'm working on making an boot image file for a device that uses Linux as a base OS, not sure what base distro, but for the majority of its system graphic files, it uses .bmp.gz files. Now, I already have my boot image file itself (640x480 24-bit color-depth bitmap) that's 901 KB in size. The trouble is, when I download a boot image from a community site that serves themes and boot logos, the boot logos are like 21 KB in size (that inflate to 901 KB .BMPs), and the default boot logo is deflated to a scant 10 KB! And it, too, inflates to 901 KB. When I use gzip to compress my file, I use the -v9k flag and only manage 84.1%, resulting in a compressed filesize of 144 KB. Is there anything I can do to increase compression?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Greetings, penguins. Got a question. So recently I had dual-boot Kali with Windows. After some failed usage of Kali I found out in web that Kali is not the best for desktop (better use with live boot). Then I transferred to Arch Linux, again dual-boot with Windows. But Arch wasn't so user friendly as I've expected. Instead of working for myself I was working to fix Arch. Now I have only Windows, but I want to use Linux as well, again with dual-boot. :)
 The question is what Linux distro would you recommend for dual-boot? I want something to help me understand how Linux works ( not ones that are 99% like Windows and etc. ) and if possible suitable for gaming. Thank you in advance!! :) 
 P. S. 
 If you're wondering why in the world I still want to use Windows the answer is Lenovo Vantage. My laptop is Lenovo Legion 5 pro and that app helps me to configure everything on my laptop, especially GPU Mode (Hybrid mode, dGPU mode, etc. ).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[人工智能工件需要新的开源许可证

上世纪七八十年代，由于自由软件运动的兴起，从版权法中衍生出来了自由及开源软件许可证，护航了自由及开源软件的蓬勃发展。人工智能诞生于开源软件，像 TensorFlow、PyTorch 这样的人工智能程序在其开源许可下运行良好。但新的人工智能工件，如数据集、模型、权重等并不完全适用于传统的版权模式。就像对 GitHub Copilot 输出的代码建议的起诉案，相信对用于训练人工智能违例使用各种训练素材的起诉会越来越多。甚至，会有像专利巨魔一样的许可证巨魔出现。开源倡议（OSI）和许多开源和人工智能领导人正在努力将人工智能和开源许可证以对两者都有意义的方式结合起来。


消息来源：The Register



老王点评：人工智能崛起的太快，一年前还没什么人谈论人工智能，以至于很多事情都来不及做好准备。所以，现在需要一个像当年的自由软件宣言一样的提纲挈领的倡议出现，以及在这个基础上建立的不同的许可证，才能真正为人工智能的发展铺平道路。




安卓的紧急呼叫打爆英国 999 紧急电话

安卓 12 系统为紧急服务增加了一个简单的功能：只要连按五次电源键，你的手机就会为你拨打紧急服务。当手机放在你的口袋里，或者你有一个不正常的电源按钮时，这显然很容易意外地做到。英国警方称，“所有紧急服务机构目前都在经历创纪录的 999 电话量”。有趣的是，带有这个功能的安卓 12 是在一年半前推出的，但直到现在才逐步普及到足够多的设备上。从那时起，就有源源不断的帖子提醒人们注意这个问题。在补丁出来之前，谷歌目前的建议是关闭该功能。


消息来源：Ars Technica



老王点评：这又是一个产品经理想当然的功能。




新车质量因使用更多新技术而下降

据研究，在美国销售的新车的质量正在下降，因为越来越多地使用了新技术和某些零件的制造质量下降等因素使这些车型更有“问题”。报告说，在过去两年中，每 100 辆车的问题数（PP100）上升了 30。特斯拉的 PP100 质量评级，同比增加了 31，到 2023 年达到了 257。新车提供的电子触摸式设计的门把手也成为了一个问题，在 10 个问题最多的车型中，有 7 个是电池电动车。


消息来源：路透社



老王点评：电动车是有很多先进的地方，但是堆砌不成熟的新技术往往是造成崩溃的原因。这有点像一个刚刚学会使用新框架的开发者，喜欢利用各种新功能来开发软件，但是往往出现一些问题。]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[《线的文化史》，[英]蒂姆·英戈尔德著，张晓佳译，明室Lucida｜北京联合出版社，2023年5月出版，288页，62.00元

日本科幻小说家伴名练的短篇小说《平滑世界和它的敌人》（收于《平滑世界和它的敌人》，丁丁虫译，译林出版社，2022年）讲述了一个有趣的故事：作品设定人类开发出一种名为“乘觉”的第六感，可以自由穿梭于平行时空当中，这样一来世界就变得无比“平滑”——无论在何时何地遇到问题，人只要调动“乘觉”前往新的时空，问题便可迎刃而解。
然而就是这样一个“美丽新世界”，却依然有它的敌人。有人开发出一种可以屏蔽“乘觉”的药物，结果一场意外事故让一名制药厂员工不慎失去了“乘觉”，这名员工出于报复心理，试图向社会投放这种药物。故事接下来的走向乍看出人意料，却又在情理之中——当人的所有经验都可以自由索取、无限重来，“一生一次”的体验反而变得弥足珍贵、令人心仪。
从某种意义上，我们这个世界虽然还做不到“来去自由”，但它的确是在向“平滑化”迈进。今天的人们足不出户便能接收全球资讯，轻点鼠标即可与世界另一端的人“实时互联”，更不必说种种方兴未艾的“虚拟现实”（VR）和“增强现实”（AR）技术，其实就是在为人类提供自由穿梭于平行时空的可能。然而这种“平滑”也滋生了诸多问题，譬如它的脆弱性——我们几乎无法忍受自己或是他者“不在线”或是“掉线”；再如当现实世界被置换为“屏幕世界”，“避开现实而紧盯屏幕已经成为现状。屏幕训练我们去顺应和满足现状，而我们已经开始接受这种现状并取其精华、去其糟粕”（[荷兰]诺伦·格尔茨：《虚无主义》，张红军译，商务印书馆，123页）。
基于这样的前提，英国人类学家蒂姆·英戈尔德的这部《线的文化史》今天读来格外有趣。由人类的制线行为（line-making）入手，英戈尔德考察了“线”作为一种现象，在人类实践中的存在及其演变。在他看来，作为主体的“实线”曾经是人…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've been using Linux since 2017 as my main OS until my old laptop stopped working last year and I had to buy another one. My choice was the Galaxy Book S - but my nightmare started when I arrived home and tried to install Ubuntu on it. For some reason, the installer couldn't recognize any disk, and the same issue appeared over and over, no matter which distro I tried to use. 
 After some research I found out that this model does not use a regular SSD, but an eUFS instead (I've never heard about it before, apparently it is often used within smartphones). Since then, I'm stuck in Windows. Ubuntu sometimes recognizes it but it's never able to finish installation, the disk always disappears before it.
 Does anyone have any idea of how to solve it? I've been thinking in some way to install just a "windows-skeleton-alike" with no visual system, just code, and install a virtual machine with Ubuntu above it, but I'm not sure if this is even a possibility.
 I do not like using Windows at all, and I don't know what to do anymore. Unfortunately selling it and buying another is not an option at the moment.

LibreOffice 被全球数百万用户使用，是当今最流行的免费办公套件。它由电子表格程序 （Calc）、文档处理器（Writer）、演示文稿（Impress）、绘图（Draw）和数学模块组成，可帮助你完成大部分办公、商务、学术和日常工作。

由于与 DOCX、PPTX 和 XLSX 等专有文件格式兼容，LibreOffice 可以作为付费的微软 Office 套件的出色替代品。它是 Apache OpenOffice 生产力套件的一个分支，由数以千计的全球贡献者积极开发。



升级到最新的 LibreOffice

LibreOffice 改变了它的版本命名方式，不再采用"Fresh"和"Still"的概念。现在，LibreOffice 有一个社区版和一个推荐的企业版。这是因为许多企业使用带有最新功能的最新 LibreOffice 版本，这对开发工作造成了阻碍。因此，团队建议企业用户从 LibreOffice 官方合作伙伴那里获得付费支持，以获得长期支持。你可以在 此处 阅读博文。

以下是当前的版本：

最新的 LibreOffice 版本


当前的 LibreOffice 社区版本系列是 LibreOffice 7.4.x。

LibreOffice 稳定推荐的商业版本是 LibreOffice 7.3.x。

        <link href="https://lwn.net/Articles/936127/"/>
        <updated>2023-06-23T21:23:15.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Over on the Software Freedom Conservancy blog, Policy Fellow and Hacker-in-Residence Bradley M. Kuhn analyzes the recent changes to Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) source availability in light of the GPL.  It contains some interesting information about two alleged GPL violations that came about because the company's business model is structured in a way that brings it too close to non-compliance with the license, he said:

Perhaps the biggest problem with a murky business model that skirts the line of GPL compliance is that violations can and do happen — since even a minor deviation from the business model clearly violates the GPL agreements. Pre-IBM Red Hat deserves a certain amount of credit, as SFC is aware of only two documented incidents of GPL violations that have occurred since 2006 regarding the RHEL business model. We've decided to share some general details of these violations for the purpose of explaining where this business model can so easily cross the line.

[...] In another violation incident, we learned that Red Hat, in a specific non-USA country, was requiring that any customer who lowered the number of RHEL machines under service contract with Red Hat sign an additional agreement. This additional agreement promised that the customer had deleted every copy of RHEL in their entire organization other than the copies of RHEL that were currently contracted for service with Red Hat. Again, this is a "further restriction". The GPL agreements give everyone the unfettered right to make and keep as many copies of the software as they like, and a distributor of GPL'd software may not require a user to attest that they've deleted these legitimate, licensed copies of third-party-licensed software under the GPL. SFC informed Red Hat's legal department of this violation, and we were assured that this additional agreement would no longer be presented to any Red Hat customers in the future.]]></summary>

But once you start installing other software, you run into problems which do not exist in X11: you can't watch hardware accelerated videos on Chromium and derived browsers (massive shoutout to firefox for being there), various GNOME extensions will freeze up the system (ex. Pixel saver), adwaita themes will mess up (light theme on one app, dark on another) to name a few.
 Wayland still have a long way to go , till then, X11 remains the only option if you don't want to walk on egg shells.

 Overall, each IPv6 entity in the network needs a globally unique address for communicating outside of the local segment.

When talking about stateless and stateful it means if there is a server/device that keep tracks of a state for each address assignment (https://www.networkac…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[《华尔街日报》6月23日消息，Facebook母公司Meta周四表示，在加拿大议会通过一项迫使互联网巨头向新闻出版商付费的法案后，将终止在加拿大的Facebook和Instagram上提供新闻。


加拿大参议院周四批准了《在线新闻法案》（Online News Act），预计不久将正式通过。Meta在声明中说：“今天，我们确认，在《在线新闻法》生效之前，加拿大所有用户将无法在Facebook和Instagram上获取新闻。”


报道指出，加拿大“在线新闻法案”要求脸书和谷歌等互联网巨头付费使用当地媒体的新闻内容，这意味着加拿大成为继澳大利亚后第二个立法要求互联网公司为使用当地媒体新闻内容付费的国家。澳大利亚于 2021 年通过“新闻媒体与数字平台强制议价法案”。


谷歌对此抗议称，加拿大法律比澳大利亚更加严格，希望加拿大修改立法。多家美国互联网公司也表态称，这些立法对他们的业务造成了影响。


加拿大内阁领导人特鲁多谴责称，Meta 和谷歌在反抗这个法案时，用了“霸凌的手段”。法案的主要起草人、加拿大文化遗产部长 Pablo Rodriguez 也在声明中强调，这是加拿大民众对抗科技巨头的第一步。

在 Linux 命令行中，如何 搜索文件？你可以使用 find 命令。这是标准答案，没有问题。

通常，你键入带有搜索参数的命令，按回车键，然后它会显示搜索结果。

你可以通过模糊搜索来提升终端中的文件搜索体验。

模糊搜索是一种近似搜索算法或技术。在这种搜索中，通过名称搜索指定位置的文件，并实时显示结果给用户。

模糊搜索在网络搜索引擎中很受欢迎，用户开始输入术语后，它会开始显示与该术语相关的结果。

在本文中，我将讨论两个命令行工具，它们可以让你在 Linux 中执行模糊搜索：


fzf：模糊查找工具

fzy：模糊选择工具


fzf：Linux 中的模糊查找工具

fzf 是一款可用于 Linux 的模糊搜索工具，你可以通过它进行交互式文件搜索。

在 Ubuntu 中安装 fzf，打开终端并运行以下命令：

sudo apt install fzf


虽然 fzf 本身可以正常工作，但最好与其他工具配合使用，以充分发挥其功能。

使用 fzf

打开终端并运行：

fzf


这将打开一个 fzf 提示符，在当前工作目录中搜索文件。



为 fzf 应用边框

你可以使用 --border 选项为 fzf 应用边框，有多种边框可用，如 rounded（圆角）、sharp（尖角）等。

fzf --border=rounded




应用背景和前景颜色

使用颜色属性，你可以为 fzf 设置 ANSI 颜色，可以作为背景、前景或两者都设置。



fzf --color="bg:black,fg:yellow"


你可以串联这些选项，使 fzf 在视觉上更加美观。

现在，让我展示一些 fz…]]></summary>

They allow to make charts quickly. 
But you lose flexibility: you're limited by the options they offer.
I just created a gallery with hundreds of graphs made with d3.js and React.

- They all come with explanation and code sandboxes
- Gradual complexity to ease the learning curve
It took me ages to create this project! Feedback welcome!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[AlmaLinux 确认受到 RHEL 源代码发布变化影响

针对 昨天 红帽发布的改变 RHEL 源代码发布方式的公告，AlmaLinux 发布声明称，这将限制他们 1:1 复制 RHEL 构建的能力。因为 CentOS Stream 虽然是 RHEL 的上游，但并不总是包括 RHEL 软件包中的所有补丁和更新。想要做到完全复制，需要有 RHEL 构建版本时的源代码。而要获得该源代码，AlmaLinux 称，“不幸的是，按照我们今天的理解，红帽公司的用户界面协议表明，重新发布通过客户门户获得的资源将违反这些协议。”在短期内，他们将专注于通过跟踪 CentOS Stream 的变化和 Oracle Linux 等来为 AlmaLinux 提供安全更新。但从长远来看，他们将与其他 RHEL 下游产品和合作伙伴合作，寻找一条合适的发展道路。


消息来源：AlmaLinux



老王点评：对于这件事红帽背后的动机我们就不妄自揣测了，毕竟红帽和 AlmaLinux 曾经“建立了令人难以置信的工作关系”。但事实就是，社区构建的 AlmaLinux 想要跟上 RHEL 的构建会越来越麻烦和越来越慢。所以，你怎么看呢？




哈佛给计算机学生们配备了一位聊天机器人老师

哈佛大学将为今年秋季的计算机科学导论 CS50 课程的学生配置一位聊天机器人老师。这个聊天机器人将不使用 ChatGPT 或 GitHub Copilot，因为它们“太有帮助了”。相反，哈佛大学已经开发了自己的大型语言模型 “CS50 机器人”，它将 “具有类似的精神”，但将专注于 “引导学生找到答案，而不是将答案交给他们”。


消息来源：PCMag



老王点评：我认为哈佛大学走在了正确的道路，拥抱 AI，而不是让 AI 替代人类，让 AI 帮助学习，而不是让学生抄袭 AI 的作业。




E3 或许再也不会举办

之前，我们 报道 过，今年的 E3 2023 已经取消，这本应是 2019 年后的第一次 E3 线下盛会。现在，E3 已经取消了 2024 年和 2025 年在洛杉矶的活动。这表明有些事情阻碍了 E3 的回归，或者其组织者正在考虑将其迁出洛杉矶。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all, 
 I have a microcontroller board on which I am opening up an MMS port. I set the board on a static IP (this is required) and I am trying to see what data I am getting on the IEDExplorer tool which works on MMS protocol.
 Now, if the system that runs the IEDExplorer tool is on a static IP of the same range (10.3.11.x) then it works, but if the system is on a dynamic IP of the range 172.x.x.x, I can ping the board but I don't see any data on the tool.
 The application that I am using is correct because it has been previously on a different Linux image and a different processor. 
 The only thing that I am suspecting is that something might be wrong with the Linux image I have built using yocto and if something can be changed about it. 
 Feel free to ask more details and I would be really glad if you can help me out as I don't see any solution at all. (Firewall is allowing all the traffic and there is no proxy)
 ​
 Thanks.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[《隐喻学范式》，[德]汉斯·布鲁门贝格著，李贯峰译，东方出版中心，2023年4月出版，275页，59.80元

尽管我们可以将德国思想家布鲁门贝格（Hans Blumenberg，1920-1996）的学术研究视为现代欧陆哲学隐喻复兴运动的重要组成，但他的思想风格既无法完全归入胡塞尔的现象学传统，也不属于重返修辞的后哲学论说。有趣的是，倘若我们试着列一份康德之后以独特生活方式著称的思想家名单，布鲁门贝格一定位列其中。与大多数犹太裔学者一样，布鲁门贝格在二战结束后返回校园，最初在汉堡大学师从胡塞尔的助手兰德格里伯（Ludwig Landgrebe，1902-1991）学习哲学、日耳曼学和古典语文学，后跟随他转入基尔大学，并在那里获得博士学位。1947年起，布鲁门贝格辗转汉堡大学、吉森大学、波鸿鲁尔大学和明斯特大学任教，直到1985年在明斯特退休。不接受采访，不参与学术和公共活动，退休后的布鲁门贝格以哲学隐士的姿态隐居于僻静之处。这不禁让人想起康德《纯粹理性批判》的题词：“关于自己，我们宁可沉默。”（De nobis ipsis silemus. 伽达默尔也曾将这句话写在自传扉页上）

1980年，布鲁门贝格获得弗洛伊德奖时发表演说。

归隐的生活状态和晦涩的写作风格削弱了布鲁门贝格的学术知名度，但也让一部分人相当着迷，小说家西碧拉·莱维查洛夫（Sibylle Lewitscharoff）便是其中之一。布鲁门贝格深爱与狮子有关的隐喻，他在《不在场的狮子：书斋里的圣哲罗姆》（Das Abwesende am Löwen: Hieronymus im Gehäus mit Sanduhr；收录于其身后整理出版的《狮子》一书）中讨论了一头试图攻击圣哲罗姆的狮子被圣人的雄辩和哲思驯服，从此庇护其左右的故事。莱维查洛夫由此得到灵感，创作了小说《布鲁门贝格》。在小说中，狮子在某天晚上悄然出…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[到目前为止，我们已经讲解了包括 变量、可变性、常量、数据类型、函数、if-else 语句 和 循环 在内的一些关于 Rust 编程的基础知识。

在 Rust 基础系列的最后一章里，让我们现在用 Rust 编写一个程序，使用这些主题，以便更好地理解它们在现实世界中的用途。让我们来编写一个相对简单的程序，用来从水果市场订购水果。

我们程序的基本结构

来让我们首先向用户问好，并告诉他们如何与程序交互。

fn main() {
    println!("欢迎来到水果市场！");
    println!("请选择要购买的水果。\n");

    println!("\n可以购买的水果：苹果、香蕉、橘子、芒果、葡萄");
    println!("购买完成后，请输入“quit”或“q”。\n");
}


获取用户输入

上面的代码非常简单。目前，你不知道接下来该做什么，因为你不知道用户接下来想做什么。

所以让我们添加一些代码，接受用户输入并将其存储在某个地方以便稍后解析，然后根据用户输入采取适当的操作。

use std::io;

fn main() {
    println!("欢迎来到水果市场！");
    println!("请选择要购买的水果。\n");

    println!("\n可以购买的水果：苹果、香蕉、橘子、芒果、葡萄");

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[美国联邦贸易委员会(FTC)将于周四在联邦法庭上提出初步禁令，以暂时阻止微软690亿美元（备注：当前约4954.2亿元人民币）收购动视暴雪(Activision Blizzard)。他们认为在政府作出裁决之前应该先停止交易。


微软曾表示，“临时阻止”可能会破坏这笔交易，但法院通常不会考虑这种现实后果。如果法院暂停这笔交易，微软和动视暴雪就得将其原定于7月18日终止的协议延后。


在旧金山一家联邦法官预定为期五天的听证会上，反垄断执法机构将辩称，它需要让微软公司和动视暴雪公司在联邦法院就合并案作出裁决之前暂缓该交易，因为该机构的内部法院尚未就该交易是否损害了游戏行业的竞争状况作出裁决。


FTC担心，如果没有联邦法院采取行动，两家公司的合并“可能会改变动视暴雪的运营和商业计划”，并且可能导致微软获取敏感的企业信息。


据悉，FTC内部的行政听证会定于8月2日开始，而解决美国FTC的诉讼是微软和动视暴雪在全球范围内争取完成这笔交易的关键反垄断战之一。


FTC认为，这笔交易将是微软有史以来最大的一笔交易，也是游戏业务史上最大的一笔交易。它将使微软拥有“削弱或降低动视暴雪内容的能力和动机”，从而实质性地减少竞争。


此外，FTC曾在12月份要求其内部行政法庭阻止这笔交易，并表示该合并将使微软的Xbox游戏机独占动视暴雪游戏，而任天堂和索尼会被排除在外。


微软曾表示，这笔交易将有利于游戏玩家和游戏公司双方的利益，并已向FTC提出签署具有法律约束力的同意书，承诺在未来十年内向包括索尼在内的竞争对手提供“使命召唤”游戏。


听证会将于6月22日开始，持续到6月29日。微软首席执行官萨蒂亚・纳德拉(Satya Nadella)和动视暴雪首席执行官鲍比・科迪克(Bobby Kotick)等高管都将作为证人出庭作证。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So I've had a Lenovo Yoga 2 pro (2013) that I've had Ubuntu and mint on previously installed. It came with windows 8, but it has issues related to windows 10 so I tried Linux. Both mint and Ubuntu worked initially for awhile, but eventually both hit a point where the track pad stops responding until I do a full reinstall. I also noticed that the fans seemed to run higher more often than windows. I'm curious if another distro would fix these problems or if it just isn't going to work. 
 I'd use it mainly for hobby programming/browsing, and to learning Linux more. If it's futile also looking for laptop suggestions for replacements in the future.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Openbox 是一款适用于 Linux 的轻量级、可配置的窗口堆叠式管理器。它支持许多标准，适用于任何桌面环境。

可能让你惊讶的是，LXDE 和 LXQT 桌面环境都是基于 Openbox 构建的。你甚至可以用它替换桌面环境的窗口管理器。

当然，你几乎可以在任何 Linux 发行版上安装 Openbox。不过，配置它需要时间和精力。

一个更简单的方法是使用提供 Openbox 变种的发行版。在本文中，我列出了一些能够让你轻松体验 Openbox 的发行版。

注意： 列表按字母顺序排列，不代表排名。

1、Archcraft



如果你想体验 Openbox 窗口管理器，Archcraft 是一个不错的选择。不像其他发行版，Openbox 是这个发行版的默认桌面环境，所以你可以期待它的表现优秀。

它提供了一个精简且轻量的环境，只需不到 500MB 的内存即可运行，而且外观上也没有降级。其界面元素风格统一。

你可以通过简单点击来切换主题，如果你喜欢，它还提供了类似 Windows 的用户界面。

对于资深用户来说，它内置了对 AUR 和 Chaotic-AUR 的支持。与其他发行版不同的是，它提供了最佳的开箱即用体验。


Archcraft


2、ArcolinuxB Openbox



如果你想学习 Arch（Arcolinux 项目的主要目标），ArcolinuxB Openbox 是一个非常优秀的 Linux 桌面发行版。

它是 ArcolinuxB 项目的众多变种之一。你可能会遇到一些学习曲线和不完善的地方。

与 Archcraft 不同，你在这里不会看到完全统一的界面元素，可能需要进行一些调整来获得良好的体验。


ArcolinuxB


3、AV Linux MX Edition

I know i have an extremely long way too go but I was just curious on what it takes to actually contribute. I have a basic understanding of distros and the command line but other than that I’m no more knowledgeable than a windows user who just wanted to see what Linux was all about. I would like to also hear some things from actual developers!

So I am curious what are some interesting educational resources for people in more advanced engineering roles? Courses or resources that might help one move to an Architect or Principal/Staff role?

describing the impact of Red Hat's decision to stop releasing the source to
the RHEL distribution and how AlmaLinux will respond.


	In the immediate term, our plan is to pull from CentOS Stream
	updates and Oracle Linux updates to ensure security patches
	continue to be released. These updates will be carefully curated to
	ensure they are 1:1 compatible with RHEL, while not violating Red
	Hat’s licensing, and will be vetted and tested just like all of our
	other releases.


Update: Rocky Linux has also sent out a
release on the subject.  "There will be no disruption or change for
any Rocky Linux users, collaborators, or partners".]]></summary>

I installed Ubuntu, Fedora, Linux Mint, Pop!_OS, Manajro, Arch Linux, Debian, Vanilla OS, etc. In all of them I had problems with overheating, no iGPU usage resulting in Twitch dropping frames like crazy and other problems.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[RHEL 源代码将只放在 CentOS Stream 上

在没有宣布废弃 CentOS 之前，RHEL 的源代码会发布在 git.centos.org 上，那时候 CentOS 还是 RHEL 的下游。之后，在 CentOS Stream 成为 RHEL 的上游后，该仓库得以保留。红帽宣布，“CentOS Stream 将成为公开发布 RHEL 相关源代码的唯一仓库。对于红帽的客户和合作伙伴，源代码将继续通过红帽客户门户网站提供。”并进一步澄清，“这一变化并不意味着CentOS 项目、CentOS Stream 或 CentOS SIG 的源代码可用性有任何变化。”但这一举动引来了社区的一些人的担心，“Alma Linux，Rocky Linux，Oracle Linux 等将更难提供与 RHEL 版本 1:1 的二进制兼容的构建。”


消息来源：Phoronix



老王点评：我认为，从目前的声明上看，这种担心或许是多余的，我们只需要观察之后的 RHEL 和 CentOS Stream 之间差异有多大就好了。但从对这个事情的反应可以看出，社区对红帽的信任在降低。




Reddit 用户涌入 Lemmy

类似马斯克收购 Twitter 后 Twitter 难民涌入 Mastodon，大量 Reddit 难民涌入了 Lemmy 实例。其中，lemmy.world 实例的总用户数达到了 3.8 万。突然间，Lemmy 已经成为最大的联邦宇宙项目之一。在 Reddit 社区重新开放之后，部分用户可能会离开，但也许有更多用户会留下。


消息来源：Lemmy



老王点评：这些联邦宇宙社区会得到更多用户，但 Twitter、Reddit 失血更多。




C++ 26 标准正在制定中

C++ 版本以其发布的年份命名，并遵循三年的周期。国际标准化组织 C++ 标准委员会发布了 C++ 26 的进展情况。根据其时间表，新语言功能的截止日期是 2024 年第三季度，功能冻结将在 2025 年第一季度。委员会已经通过了 40 份 “修改文件”，增加了 _ 字符通配符，基本字符集添加了 @、$ 和 `。此外，在 C++ 26 中还支持了危险指针。危险指针是指 “只有其所有者可以设置其值，而任何数量的线程都可以读取其值” 的指针，它很难导致非常常见的内存安全问题。


消息来源：Dev Class



老王点评：在我看来，C++ 标准的演进有一定的意义，但是这并不能阻止其传统的领域被 Rust、Carbon 等新底层语言的侵蚀。]]></summary>

 I have T440p laptop on which i installed OpenSuse TW. I can only use it with external monitor because the built in screen wont turn on. I tried installing Nvidia drivers with Yast - and i did it - nothing special.
 But laptop is always using the iGPU (which i read online is the cause of the problem). Also using YAST i installed bbswitch and bumblebee, nvidia and suse prime and what not - but nothing is helping. I would like to be able to use the laptop on the go and without the external monitor. 
 Does anyone know how to fix this, because i really want to learn Linux and use it for school and am also switching from windows - but i spen almost two months trying to solve the problem without success. Thank you for your help in advance and see you

An old laptop, and i wanted to make it alive again, I found out that the battery is dead, and im not planning to replace it. Replaced the hard thermal paste on both gpu and cpus, then i tried running it with only the charger. I remember upgrading it from windows 7 to windows 10. It booted up successfully. After using it for some minutes, It just powers off. I have an inference that it is caused by the temperature, i tried turning on power saver and did almost everything to minimize the temperature in use. Then i decided to swtich the operating system to linux, xubuntu. Downloaded the media files, making a bootable drive to install, and then its now successfully installed with no interruptions. I ran the laptop on its coolest before I installed xubuntu. After the installation, the laptop is cooking, same temp before when trying windows 10. I tried to update and upgrade packages, after waiting for some time (it was like 33% don) the laptop just powered off. Same issue before, its got the cooking temp, still dont know the numbers, but it is really hot. I decided to install lm sensors after i booted up the system, lowered the brightness. I dont see any power consumption related settings other than sleep mode, display power management etc. Its currently idle for about half an hour, 51.0°c, 53.0°c (core 1 and 2). I will wait for it to measure if it can stay longer when idle. Ill test later when in-use.
 I wanted to know if there are any methods that can help reduce the temperature of my laptop using the os or fiddling with the computer's configuration.
 Thank you!

美国学者莎拉·罗伯茨（Sarah T. Roberts）被誉为“数字时代的先锋研究者”，她在2010-2018年长达八年的时间里持续展开了对互联网公司中的商业性内容审核员群体的工作状况及生存环境的访谈调查与实例研究，《幕后之人：社交媒体时代的内容审核》（原书名Behind the Screen:Content Moderation in the Shadows of Social Media，2019）是一部具有开创性的互联网田野调查与社会学研究的专著。作者的调查对象与研究主题指向全球性的商业化社交媒体的内容审核运作：针对互联网上日益巨量而良莠混杂的内容，商业性内容审核是必要的工作，因此互联网公司要雇用数以百万计的内容审核员评估社交平台用户上传的信息，筛选和删除色情、暴力、仇恨言论等不良内容。但是由于各种原因，这个工作群体一直隐身于幕后，其游离于社会、薪资低微、劳累过度、精神创伤等生存状况亦一直未能引起社会关注与疗救。莎拉·罗伯茨克服了互联网公司保密协议、地域限制等重重困难，对从硅谷到菲律宾、从专业审核公司到主要社交媒体的一线员工进行了深度采访，全面考察、分析了互联网商业性内容审核工作的不同类型（短期合同工、专业公司、外包、零工）及作为“幕后之人”的审核员群体的工作与生存状况，同时也对内容审核与相关政策争议、对现实影响的关系进行了分析和阐述。“打开了一扇了解内容审核这一晦暗不明世界的窗口。……是数字经济这一关键领域的权威著作，必将影响未来几年的政策和研究。”联合国特别报告员大卫·凯依（David Kaye）对该书的这一评语是客观、中肯的。

黄宾虹曾跋：“巨然墨法自米氏父子、高房山、吴仲圭一脉相承，学者宗之，及董玄宰用兼皴带染法，娄东、虞山日益凌替，至道咸为之中兴。”（图一）黄宾虹从道光、咸丰年间金石碑学之昌盛中寻到了中国画变革的动力，以“道咸画学中兴说”批判自宋以降落向窠臼的传统艺术，在二十世纪上半叶掀起了一场以北宋为宗的中国画“文艺复兴”。在深空探测和AI技术获得突破性发展的二十一世纪二十年代，再次回溯百余年前中国画坛的风云变幻，我们有理由以更广阔的眼光观想一张与十九至二十世纪之际世界艺术之现代主义运动同构的中国画史图景。我们业已建立寻常的画史共识：清末绘画流于程式，日渐凌替，以黄宾虹、齐白石为代表的一批先锋者将中国画从陈陈相因的泥淖中解放出来，就此开创了二十世纪中国画的现代主义。

倘若我们将这一阶段视为中国画之现代性的起点，那么在百余年之后，我们是否能够，哪怕是在极为宽泛的层面上界说出中国画的后现代主义、解构主义？后现代在西方的生发有其具体的语境，将其去语境地附会在中国显然不是科学的思量，但唯独不可否认的是，这些“先锋的时髦语汇”被利用在当代中国极其繁荣的艺术活动中，可每每回归到作品——画面内部，我们的内心是否会不可避免地引发一丝对作者所宣称的思想的忧疑。形式与内容的不自洽使得我们在总体上很难坚定地否认，当代的中国画并没有完全摆脱、超越由现代主义者——黄宾虹、潘天寿诸家代表的世代所开创的“纪元”，即便我们已经走过了西方艺术史断代的现代主义时期。中国画的题材、创作手段、艺术形式较百余年前早已大相径庭，可为什么还要做出如此扫兴的论断？重大问题的症结首先并不出在方法、技术、媒材甚至概念上，而是归咎于深刻的意识层面，至少，中国画面对自…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Linux 主导着大多数互联网、大部分云计算和几乎所有的超级计算机。我也喜欢在 Linux 上进行游戏、办公工作和发挥创造力。




当你习惯于一个操作系统时，很容易将其他操作系统看作是“应用程序”。如果你在桌面上使用一种操作系统，你可能会认为另一种操作系统是人们用来运行服务器的应用程序，而又一种操作系统是用来玩游戏的应用程序，依此类推。有时我们会忘记操作系统是计算机管理无数任务的部分（从技术上讲，每秒数百万个任务），它们通常设计成能够执行各种任务。当有人问我 Linux 能做什么 时，我通常会问他们想让它做什么。这没有一个单一的答案，所以这里有五个让我惊讶的 Linux 用途。

1、用 Linux 进行激光切割



在离我最近的创客空间里，有一台巨大的工业机器，大约和一张沙发一样大小，可以根据一个简单的线条图设计文件来切割各种材料。这是一台强大的激光切割机，令我惊讶的是，我第一次使用它时发现它只需要通过 USB 线连接到我的 Linux 笔记本电脑上。事实上，在许多方面，与许多台式打印机相比，连接这台激光切割机更容易，因为许多台式打印机需要过于复杂和臃肿的驱动程序。

使用 Inkscape 和 一个简单的插件，你可以为这台工业激光切割机设计切割线条。你可以为你的树莓派笔记本设计一个外壳，使用这些知识共享的设计方案来建造 一个密码锁盒、切割一个店面标牌，或者你心目中的其他任何想法。而且，你可以完全使用开源软件来完成这些操作。

2、在 Linux 上进行游戏



开源游戏一直都有，最近一段时间也有一些备受瞩目的 Linux 游戏。我建造的第一台游戏电脑就是一台 Linux 电脑，我觉得我邀请过来一起玩沙发合作游戏的人们都没有意识到他们是在 Linux 上进行游戏。这是一种流畅顺滑的体验，而且取决于你愿意在硬件上花费多少，可能上无止境吧。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[6月21日消息，亿欧网创始人黄渊普发布一封举报信，实名举报全国政协委员、知乎创始人兼CEO周源恶意挑拨员工群体与企业主群体对立、严重破坏国内营商环境。黄渊普表示，恳请有关部门介入，调查我所说的情况；我愿意协助调查和调研，为有关部门提供必要的材料和证据。


以下为公开信全文：



黄渊普：实名举报全国政协委员、知乎创始人兼CEO周源恶意挑拨员工群体与企业主群体对立、严重破坏国内营商环境


尊敬的相关部门领导，我叫黄渊普，作为主要创始人做了一家叫“亿欧”《北京亿欧网盟科技有限公司》的小公司，籍贯为湖南邵阳，户籍所在地在上海市长宁区，身份证号43052719xx10xx42xx，联系方式为：15810157304。我今天实名举报全国政协委员、知乎〔北京智者天下科技有限公司，简称“知乎”）创始人兼CEO周源通过其创立的知乎平台、设置不合理的机制恶意挑拨了员工群体与企业主群体对立、严重破坏了国内营商环境。


以下为我的陈述，我对我所说的话负责；


2023年6月20日上午，在听到一位创业者朋友抱怨自己在知乎平台上被人匿名诽谤的事情后，我也在知乎上搜索了一下自己的名字“黄渊普”。发现一个“提问”（目前知乎上已经被删）∶亿欧黄渊普会卷钱跑路吗？


这个提问由知乎的匿名用户以匿名的方式提出。但其实，亿欧是科创产业智库，商业模式主要是给科技企业提供研究、咨询、品牌等服务，主营业务应收账款较大，只有占营收非常小的会员和VIP服务采取先付款后提供服务的方式。


这个提问和描述十分恶意，把我本人与某不同行业领域的企业负责人做恶意对比。这个提问，在我发现它之前，它应该已经存在一段时间（知乎的“提问”不对外显示提问时间）。在我发现这个提问之前，它对我个人名誉已经造成了损害，对公司品牌和人才招聘也有不利影响。


这不是我第一次在知乎上遭遇这类匿名提问和匿…]]></summary>

 If we look at professional use and sum up the % of the platforms, it doesn't add up to 100%.
 Wouldn't WSL under Windows be considered Windows?
 If we add all the Linux distros together then the % is the highest?
 If we add up the responses of Linux distros, it's ~47.5k which is higher than the responses for Windows - why did they list Windows as the most used platform?
 Why didn't they group Linux under a single category?
 Not sure how to interpret the results here, any ideas?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[hi all
 I am trying to use transmission to download and I swear I have exhausted all of my options on this. anytime I try to download something it errors and says permission denied even tho I have opened the directory with 777. I have googled everywhere about this and can't find anything. I should also mention that I had it working perfectly fine before it had no issue downloading, but then I wanted to move the folder and it is just not accepting it.
 thanks in advance

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello Hacker News community,
Wanted to share a project I started working on during my spare time and was then discovered by many in the open source community last week.
GPT Engineer’s mission:
Be the open platform for devs to tinker with and build their personal code-generation toolbox.
I believe it's key for us devs to engage in how building software can and will change.
You can find more info about the flexible technical "philosophy" to make it work well, and the community we want it to become on github:
https://github.com/AntonOsika/gpt-engineer
The project is still in early stages. It's clear that there is a lot of room for improvement as the space to combine tricks that guide LLM's is large.
Appreciate any suggestions, experiences, or ideas on the project from you all!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Kernel support for copy offload is a feature that has been floating around
in limbo for a decade or more at this point; it has been implemented along 
the way, but never merged.  The idea is that the host
system can simply ask a block storage device to copy some data within the device
and it 
will do so without further involving the host; instead of reading data into
the host so that it can be written back out again, the device circumvents
that process.  At the
2023 Linux Storage, Filesystem,
Memory-Management and BPF Summit, Nitesh Shetty led a storage and
filesystem session to discuss the current status of a patch set that he and
others have been working on, with an
eye toward getting something merged fairly soon.]]></summary>

 I have several nvme devices in my Ubuntu 22.04.02 machine and I'd like to manually calculate the write amplification of each device by dividing nand_bytes_written / host_bytes_written.
 I believe host_bytes_written can be calculated in the following manner:

 The above can be proven by using dd:
 $ nvme smart-log /dev/nvme0n1 |grep -e data_units_written data_units_written : 32,800,047 $ dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/nvme0n1 bs=512000 count=1000 oflag=direct 1000+0 records in 1000+0 records out 512000000 bytes (512 MB, 488 MiB) copied, 0.967242 s, 529 MB/s $ nvme smart-log /dev/nvme0n1 |grep -e data_units_written data_units_written : 32,801,047 <--…]]></summary>

 By limiting the RHEL public sources to CentOS Stream, it will now be more difficult for community/off-shoot enterprise Linux distributions like Alma Linux, Rocky Linux, Oracle Linux, etc, to provide 1:1 binary compatible builds against given RHEL releases.
 Seems like another move to kill off Alma or Rocky

that public source releases will be restricted to CentOS Stream going
forward:


	As the CentOS Stream community grows and the enterprise software
	world tackles new dynamics, we want to sharpen our focus on CentOS
	Stream as the backbone of enterprise Linux innovation. We are
	continuing our investment in and increasing our commitment to
	CentOS Stream. CentOS Stream will now be the sole repository for
	public RHEL-related source code releases. For Red Hat customers
	and partners, source code will remain available via the Red Hat

is still not as easy as on x86 systems because many Arm devices require a
vendor-supplied kernel, a patched bootloader, and other device-specific
components. One distribution that addresses this problem is Armbian, which offers Debian- and
Ubuntu-based distributions for
many devices. The headline feature in the recent release, Armbian
23.05, which came at the end of May, is a major rework of the build
framework that has been made faster and more reliable after three years of
development.]]></summary>

I've heard mixed opinions about the startup speed of Snap apps in Ubuntu and wanted to know if it's a common issue or something that can be optimized. Additionally, I've come across comments stating that Ubuntu pushes users to install software exclusively through snaps, rather than using traditional deb packages. Is this true, and are there any limitations or drawbacks to this approach?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[据美联社报道，Twitter（推特）员工昨日向旧金山联邦法院提起诉讼，要求该公司兑现有关奖金的承诺。


员工们表示，在马斯克收购该公司之前的一个月里，包括前首席财务官内德・西格尔（Ned Segal）在内的高管“一再”向员工承诺，将支付他们 2022 年奖金的 50%。但随着马斯克的到来，这些关于奖金的承诺至今没有落地。


此次诉讼案件的首席原告马克・肖宾格（Mark Schobinger）是上月刚从 Twitter 离职的前薪酬高级总监，他的律师正代表 Twitter 现员工和前员工寻求集体诉讼。原告律师香农・利斯・赖尔丹（Shannon Liss-Riordan）表示，Twitter 所欠奖金达到“数千万美元”。


已经被马斯克解散媒体关系团队的 Twitter 除了自动回复外，没有就此给出其他回复评论。


此前报道，马斯克收购 Twitter 后一直在进行包括大幅裁员在内的各种成本压缩政策，这也导致该公司正面临来自前雇员的多起诉讼，以及众多尚未支付的账单。此前 Twitter 被曝出拒绝支付即将到期的谷歌云账单，并因拖欠房租被驱逐出位于美国科罗拉多州博尔德市的办公室。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[DeepMind 联合创始人提出新图灵测试

阿兰·图灵在 1950 年代提出了最早的对 AI 的测试，人类评估者判断他们是在和人类还是与 AI 说话。如果 AI 能冒充人类，那么它就通过了图灵测试。DeepMind 联合创始人 Mustafa Suleyman 在其新书中否定了传统的图灵测试，因为“它没有告诉我们系统能做什么或理解什么，是否建立了复杂的内心独白，或能在抽象的时间范围内进行规划”。他提出了新的图灵测试，“让 AI 将 10 万美元的种子基金变成 100 万美元，以此衡量 AI 是否具有类人的智能”。AI 需要研究一个电商方案，制定产品计划，找到制造商和销售商品。他预测 AI 将在两年内实现这一目标：“我们不只关心机器能说什么，我们还关心它能做什么。”


消息来源：Business Insider



老王点评：之前我们在 #1036 报道过，AI 撰写的商业计划书获得了更多投资人的青睐，我就谈到或许以后可以直接投资 AI 管理运营的企业。现在看起来，这个日子不会太远。不过，要是 AI 都会自己赚钱了，可以自己养自己了，还要人类干啥？




OpenAI 准备建立 AI 应用商店

据透露，OpenAI 正在考虑推出一个应用市场，客户可以将他们根据自己的需要定制的人工智能模型出售给其他企业。例如，可以发现在线零售交易中的金融欺诈，或回答有关特定市场的最新信息的模型。目前还不清楚 OpenAI 是否会对这些销售收取佣金，或者以其他方式从市场上获得收入。


消息来源：The Information



老王点评：有苹果应用商店的成功在前，这真是一个聪明的主意。不过我更倾向于将来会有 AI 自己使用的一种交易机制，AI 们可以在其中交易训练数据、模型权重和特定的模型等，并通过买来或学到的“技能”换取更多的交易机会。




微软计划淘汰原生的邮件和日历应用引来批评

微软打算关闭其时常被人诟病的邮件和日历应用程序，将其功能放到新的 Windows 版 Outlook 中。然而，尽管多年来用户对这些应用程序提出了一些批评，但对上述决定有一些强烈的负面反应。有用户评论，“看到微软为 Windows 开发网络应用，却为安卓、iOS 和 MacOS 打造高质量的原生应用，这有点搞笑，但也很悲哀。”用户认为淘汰邮件和日历的决定是对 WinUI 原生工具包的信心丧失，“如果你不能将 UWP 应用程序移植到本地工具包，这基本上就是承认没有人应该建立原生 Windows 应用程序。甚至微软也不使用他们自己的工具包。”


消息来源：The Register



老王点评：虽然邮件和日历应用有点鸡肋，但是连微软都不在自己的 Windows 上开发原生的应用，而用网络应用敷衍——这恐怕不完全是因为网络应用更流行，也是原生应用走衰的趋势吧。]]></summary>

Open For All，LLUG 经验与你共享

LLUG 举办的初衷是希望让大家可以从线上重归线下，与更多的人可以当面交流，迸发出灵感和创新的火花。而我们自己的力量是薄弱的，不足以支撑足够高频和多次的线下活动，我们希望有更多的人可以参与到线下活动的组织过程中。

所以，我们将我们的活动举办经验开放出来，方便有志于组织线下活动的同好们，可以和我们一起组织线下活动，促进更多的线下交流和沟通。

你可以在 https://github.com/Linux-CN/LLUG-Guides/tree/main 找到我们开放出来的 LLUG 活动组织手册，并参考手册，组织你自己的线下活动。

当然，在组织线下活动过程中，如果你认为手册有值得优化的点，也期待你能参与到项目的贡献当中，我们一起共建一个更好的活动组织手册。

当计算机显示器的调色板有限时，网页设计师通常使用一组 Web 安全颜色 来创建网站。虽然在较新设备上显示的现代网站可以显示比最初的 Web 安全调色板更多的颜色，但我有时喜欢在创建网页时参考 Web 安全颜色。这样我就知道我的网页在任何地方都看起来不错。

你可以在网上找到 Web 安全调色板，但我想拥有自己的副本以方便参考。你也可以使用 Bash 中的 for 循环创建一个。

Bash for 循环

Bash 中的 for 循环 的语法如下所示：

for 变量 in 集合 ; do 语句 ; done


例如，假设你想打印从 1 到 3 的所有数字。你可以快速在 Bash 命令行上编写一个 for 循环来为你完成这项工作：

$ for n in 1 2 3 ; do echo $n ; done
1
2
3


分号是标准的 Bash 语句分隔符。它们允许你在一行中编写多个命令。如果你要在 Bash 脚本文件中包含这个 for 循环，你可以用换行符替换分号并像这样写出 for 循环：

for n in 1 2 3
  do
    echo $n
  done


我喜欢将 do 和 for 放在同一行，这样我更容易阅读：

for n in 1 2 3 ; do
  echo $n
done


一次多个 for 循环

你可以将一个循环放在另一个循环中。这可以帮助你迭代多个变量，一次做不止一件事。假设你想打印出字母 A、B 和 C 与数字 1、2 和 3 的所有组合。你可以在 Bash 中使用两个 for 循环来实现，如下所示：

#!/bin/bash
for number in 1 2 3 ; do
  for letter …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[《清代武科考试研究》，李林著，中华书局2022年12月出版，548页，168.00元

李林先生所著《清代武科考试研究》（以下简称“李著”）终于在2022年底出版了。该书一经面世，即在科举学界赢得一片赞誉。几个月来，我认真拜读了“李著”，深感这是一部超越以往研究清代武举制度的上乘之作，可谓是后来居上。
一
“李著”是在其博士论文基础上修改完成的。2014年，我曾赴香港中文大学参加李林的博士论文答辩，了解原稿的情况。现在的成果较之九年前的博士论文《“干城之选”——清代武举制度之设计、运作及其功效》，已在史料、论证、数字统计等多方面有了新的突破。一部博士论文经八年之久的修改才出版，这是不多见的，可见作者用功之勤。这八年，他坚持不懈，不断补充，不断完善（其间，我曾两次询问，他都回答还在修改之中），最终使该书在研究的深度、广度上都有了大幅度的提升，至少让我感觉是面目一新。
人们之所以赞誉“李著”，是因为以往研究武举考试的不多，特别是从制度层面研究的则更少，“李著”恰恰填补了这一空白。武科研究成果较少，原因有二。一是在科举时代，武科不如文科地位重要，在社会上的影响更是远不及文科。况且科举选官只是入仕之选，今后的升迁则靠个人的能力。文官靠官场上的政绩，武官则靠战场上的军功，因此对于武科出身者而言，军功更重于出身（“李著”也充分论述了这一点）。文科出身而统率军队者不乏其人。如康熙三十九年进士年羹尧于雍正初任抚远大将军，主持西北军务，平定罗卜藏丹津叛乱，有《年大将军兵法》传世。雍正时的著名军事将领张广泗、岳钟琪，均非武举出身。因为武科一直不受重视，研究者当然也就不多。二是武科留下的史料远不及文科那么丰富，这也造成武科研究的一定困难，让人望而止步。最早研究清代科举制度的专著是商衍鎏先生的《清代科举考试述录》，全书共八章，该书只是在第五章第一节讲武科，简单介绍了武童试、武乡试、武会试、武殿试。…]]></summary>

 As you may know, we went dark for over a week to protest a recent change announced by reddit.
 Here is a link to what is happening and why we went dark: https://www.reddit.com/r/ModCoord/comments/1476fkn/reddit_blackout_2023_save_3rd_party_apps/
 ​
  
Apollo made 7 billion requests last month, which would put it at about 1.7 million dollars per month, or 20 million US dollars per year. Even if I only kept subscription users, the average Apollo user uses 344 requests per day, which would cost $2.50 per month, which is over double what the subscription currently costs, so I'd be in the red every month.
  
We have received a message from the Admin team basically demanding that we stop the protest of the recent API changes or we will be removed: https://i.imgur.com/s7kM6j5.png
 The mod team is currently discussing ways to continue participating in the API protest without putting the subreddit at risk. A few ways that other subreddits have implemented are:
  
One day a week blackouts
 
Banning a specific letter and removing posts/comments that include that letter
 
Marking the subreddit as NSFW since this is all motivated by maximizing advertising revenue for their upcoming IPO
 
 ​
 The list of demands that need to be addressed as a result of this change: https://www.reddit.com/r/ModCoord/comments/148ks6u/indefinite_blackout_next_steps_polling_your/jo0pqzk/
 Please share your feedback and any suggestions you may have for showing our support to 3rd party apps and scripts that will be negatively impacted by this API change.

Well, let's up the difficulty.
Imagine that, on top of not knowing exactly how much you were paying for your inputs, you also didn't know if you would have consistent and continued access to your wholesaler, your food supplier, or your building materials.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi HN! I'm excited to share Autolabel, an open-source Python library to label and enrich text datasets with any Large Language Model (LLM) of your choice.
We built Autolabel because access to clean, labeled data is a huge bottleneck for most ML/data science teams. The most capable LLMs are able to label data with high accuracy, and at a fraction of the cost and time compared to manual labeling. With Autolabel, you can leverage LLMs to label any text dataset with https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36409201

is handled by the stable maintainers or the developers of the fixes.
However, due 
to some unhappiness in the XFS development
community with the process of handling stable fixes for that filesystem,
a different process has come about for backporting XFS patches to the
stable kernels.  The three developers doing that work, Leah Rumancik, Amir
Goldstein, and Chandan Babu Rajendra, led a plenary session at the 
2023 Linux Storage, Filesystem,

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[据阿里巴巴官微消息，6月20日，阿里巴巴控股集团董事会主席兼CEO张勇通过全员信宣布，阿里云智能集团完全分拆已经启动，正处于向上发展的最关键时期，必须全身心投入。同时为了适应未来发展规范和要求，其个人不宜再同时担任两家公司董事长与CEO职务。


经阿里巴巴控股集团董事会同意，张勇将于今年9月10日卸任阿里巴巴控股集团董事会主席兼CEO职务。张勇此后将专职担任阿里云智能集团董事长兼CEO，专注阿里云的发展，持续提升阿里云的行业竞争力与全球竞争力，让阿里云为各行业尤其中小企业的数智化升级提供更优质安全便捷的基础服务。同时，经过阿里巴巴控股集团董事会批准，集团执行副主席蔡崇信将出任阿里巴巴控股集团董事会主席；吴泳铭出任阿里巴巴控股集团CEO，同时继续兼任淘天集团董事长。


“过去24年间，我们有过很多次这样自我变革的时刻。如今，我们大家又一起站在一个新的起点上，开启一个通过自我变革、开辟未来发展的新阶段。”张勇在全员信中表示。



附：阿里巴巴集团董事会主席兼CEO张勇6月20日全员信


各位阿里人，


自从2015年5月担任阿里巴巴集团的CEO以来，我每年总会要给大家写几封信。也许大家已经习惯了，看到我发的全员信的时候，就知道公司又有重要的变化要发生。今天我又给大家写信了，给大家带来的是一个关于我自己的重要变化。


自今年3月宣布了集团“1+6+N”组织变革以后，目前各项工作都在平稳有序地推进。我们在上季度财报发布的时候公布了各业务集团董事会的组成，目前各个董事会都已经开始运行。我们也公布了各业务集团和业务单元的多个计划，包括将云智能集团从阿里集团完全分拆上市，以及菜鸟集团和盒马启动上市，海外数字商业集团的独立融资等等。整个阿里巴巴正以全新姿态奔向未来。


大家都知道，云计算、大数据和人工智能等核心技术的发展将会给社会带来巨大的变革，战略意义非常重大。目前云智能集团的完全分拆工作已经开始启动，正处于最关键时刻，要求必须全身心投入其中，同时也是考虑到分拆过程中公司规范化治理的要求，我个人不宜再同时担任两家集团的董事长和首席执行官的职责。因此，阿里巴巴集团董事会讨论并接受了我的请求：自2023年9月10日起，我将不再继续担任阿里巴巴集团董事会主席和首席执行官，而专心全职做好阿里云智能集团董事长兼首席执行官的工作。同时，阿里巴巴集团董事会决定，蔡崇信（Joe C. Tsai）将接替我成为阿里巴巴集团董事会主席，吴泳铭（Eddie Yongming Wu）将接替我成为阿里巴巴集团首席执行官。他们两位都是阿里巴巴的创始人和合伙人，都在阿里巴巴集团历史发展中做出了重要贡献，都拥有丰富的经验，相信在他们的领导下，公司能够走向更辉煌的未来。


这次的变化不仅对公司、对我个人都是另一个新阶段、新旅程的开始。时光过得真快，今年是我在阿里的第十六个年头。十六年一路同行，尤其是2015年接任集团首席执行官、2019年接任集团董事会主席以来，正是因为大家对我的信任、支持、鼓励和包容，让我在这个自己从未想象到的岗位上全情投入至今，对此我衷心地感激和感谢大家。这十六年来，因为社会进步、市场发展的时代机遇，我有幸和大家一起见证了阿里巴巴高速发展的历史阶段，参与了很多从无到有、从小到大、惠及普通人的生活、惠及企业数字化进程、惠及社会美好的创造；也和大家一起共同经受住了最近三年来新冠疫情的挑战和外部环境变化带来的种种考验。无论顺境还是逆境，我们一起不仅共同成长、共同经历、共同度过，也共同收获了很多比事业更宝贵的友谊和情义。


过去24年间，我们有过很多次这样自我变革的时刻。如今，我们大家又一起站在一个新的起点上，开启一个通过自我变革、开辟未来发展的新阶段。我相信大家会支持好Joe和吴泳铭等新一届集团高年级同学的工作，每个人都能够找到属于自己的舞台和属于自己的事业，最终能贡献社会、成就公司，也能够成就自己。我也会和云智能的同学们一起站在一个全新的舞台上，一起去探索利用云计算、大数据、人工智能的全新技术，服务于千行百业数字化、智能化的巨大前景，对此我充满憧憬和期待。


青山不改，绿水长流，创造一个新的江湖，再相会，任逍遥！

谷歌对外宣传 Bard 有助于开发者提高工作效率，但它对内警告员工不要使用 Bard 生成的代码。谷歌解释称，它的内部使用禁令是因为 Bard 会产生不需要的代码建议，潜在会导致程序出现错误或过于复杂，软件过于臃肿，相比不使用 AI 辅助编程需要更多时间修复。该公司表示，它的目标是对其技术的局限性保持透明 —— Bard 会提出不想要的代码建议，但它还是有助于程序员。

老王点评：合着还是拿用户做小白鼠啊，所以你放心使用 AI 生成的代码用在生产环境吗？




Reddit 抗议活动仍在继续中

上周一二，Reddit 版主们为了抗议 Reddit 的 API 定价政策而宣布关闭他们管理的子区，最高时期超过 90% 的子区变成了私有或限制发帖状态。直到一周后，仍有三千多个子区继续抗议，但最大的一些已经重新开放，不过这些子区将他们的抗议改为到张贴喜剧演员约翰·奥利弗的照片，“所有帖子都必须是约翰·奥利弗看起来很性感的图片”。Reddit 声称，它做出 API 价格改变是为了从 AI 需求中获利，AI 可以利用其托管的内容进行大型语言模型训练。


消息来源：The Register



老王点评：即便是迫于 IPO 压力，但我说，Reddit 这件事办的很糟糕，最后很可能是两败俱伤的结果。




Meta 宣布危险到不能公布代码的语音生成 AI 模型

Meta 公司昨天宣布了一个名为 Voicebox 的新人工智能模型，它说这是迄今为止功能最全面的语音生成器，“但由于滥用的潜在风险”，目前没有公开提供 Voicebox 模型或代码。该模型仍然只是一个研究项目，Meta 公司说它可以从短至两秒的样本中生成六种语言的语音，未来可用于 “自然、真实” 的翻译等方面。


消息来源：The Verge



老王点评：当一个 AI 已经不能被人类或 AI 识别时，很可能带来的风险超过收益。]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[你是否计划在 Linux 上采用以 KDE Plasma 为基础的稳定桌面环境，并打算将其作为日常工作环境？在这里，我们为你介绍与 KDE Plasma 更好集成的前十个 Linux 发行版。


KDE Plasma 桌面环境如今已经成为数百万用户的选择。借助活跃的开发者和社区的支持，它不断改进并推出与技术潮流相符的新功能。经过多年的发展，KDE 技术现在已经能够运行在桌面、笔记本电脑、平板电脑、手机和手持游戏设备上。这对于一个桌面环境来说是非常令人惊叹的，不是吗？

我经常听到或读到 KDE 桌面的各种问题，或者与 GNOME 相比被认为它的“选项太多”。我同意这些观点。但是我们不能忽视一个事实，尽管有这些争议和不同看法，KDE Plasma 桌面环境仍然是任何个人或企业使用场景的首选解决方案之一。它有一个成熟的路线图，采用独特的 Qt 技术构建，甚至能够在汽车和其他平台上运行。此外，它还有一个专门的基金会，拥有大量开发者，每天在努力改进这个桌面环境。

这就是为什么我撰写这篇文章的目的。有数百种 Linux 发行版支持 KDE Plasma 桌面环境。但是应该选择哪一个呢？它们各自有什么优势和劣势？哪一个对我来说最好？我们将在本文中尝试回答所有这些问题，并帮助你自行做出决策。

KDE Plasma 桌面的十大 Linux 发行版

我基于使用情况而非技术术语（如安装、终端使用等）编制了以下列表。

1、Kubuntu



Kubuntu 是 Ubuntu Linux 操作系统的官方 KDE Plasma 桌面版本。它使用与 Ubuntu 相同的基础软件包，并遵循 Ubuntu 的发布计划。这意味着它在 Ubuntu 发布新版本时也会发布新版本。由于基于 Ubuntu，你可以享受到伴随 Kubuntu 版本的庞大的帮助和支持社区。Kubuntu 是…]]></summary>

《郑孝胥日记》，中华书局1993年10月版

郑孝胥，字苏戡，一字太夷，因居所名曰“海藏楼”得号海藏，常以号行。福建闽侯人，生于苏州，长于福州。中国近现代著名诗人、书法家和政治家。1882年福建乡试解元，长期佐幕张之洞，备受器重。1903年两广总督岑春煊委为洋务处督办、营务处总办，驻军龙州，筹粮饷，开银号，办教育，卓有建树，允文允武，诚人生得意之秋，旋于1905年辞归上海。1911年诏任湖南布政使，未到任而清已亡，遂成为海上坚定的逊清遗老。1923年经陈宝琛引荐，入故宫任懋勤殿行走，1924年再任总理内务大臣，1925年任张园行在总务处总管，1932年伪满洲国成立后出任国务院总理兼文教部总长，走上“不归之路”，最后于1938年病死长春。
闽人闽菜，理所当然
郑孝胥在上海近二十年，从事路矿、金融、新闻、出版等事业，并多年担任商务印书馆董事长，其间诗酒风流，与遗老唱和，与时贤周旋，特别是组织或参与壬午同年会、一元会、消寒会等雅集活动，对我们了解早期闽、川菜馆在上海的发展及其与上海文化建设的关系，大有裨益，因为这是郑氏宴集最主要的两帮菜馆；之所以闽、川菜馆合论，则是因为早期上海闽菜与川菜风格特色相近，最典型的就是消闲别墅的菜品，常在闽川之间游移，以致时人莫辨，各种指南录之类书籍，便干脆标为闽川菜馆。
郑孝胥第一次在上海上餐馆，是1883年3月8日，进京赴试，经上海：“往滋卿处，同至聚丰园，邀叶小莱舅翁饮。”（引自《郑孝胥日记》，中华书局1993年10月版，以下引用该著不另出注）这聚丰园，从其新张开业广告来看，最初可能是家京菜馆：“启者：本园开设上洋四马路，精制满汉大菜、挂炉猪鸭、透味油鸡，四时佳肴，预定包办。外国大菜，一切鲜品，不另细载。谨择四月初一日开（业）。”（《新开聚丰园》，《申报》1877年4月30日第6版）后来杭州袭名而开的聚丰园正是京菜馆兼营番菜，适成佐证…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[文档查看器是每个 Linux 发行版的必备软件，可以用来阅读 PDF 等格式的文件。

Ubuntu 等发行版上的文档查看器一般是 GNOME 中的 Evince（LCTT 译注：读作 /ɪˈvɪns/）。Evince 支持多种文件格式，非常方便。

但是除了 Evince，还有很多其他的文档阅读应用。比如 Linux 上优秀的电子书阅读应用 Foliate（LCTT 译注：读作 /ˈfəʊlɪɪt/）。

最近我又发现了另一个文档查看器：Zathura。

用 Zathura 获得摆脱鼠标的阅读体验

Zathura 是一个高度可定制的文档查看器，基于 girara 用户界面 和几个文档库。girara 实现了一个简单、最小的用户界面。

Zathura 的加载速度极快。它极其简约，没有侧边栏、菜单栏等元素。（LCTT 译注：其实 Zathura 的界面没有那么单一，按 Tab 键可以显示索引页；Zathura 有一个 guioptions 选项来设置是否显示命令行、状态栏、水平滚动条、垂直滚动条等 GUI 元素。）



按 : 键可以打开 Zathura 的命令行提示符，按 Esc 键可以退出命令行。

如果要新建书签，可以输入 :bmark 后面跟想要对这个书签设置的索引号。



按 F 键可以高亮所有链接，每条链接附带一个序号，并且界面底部会显示命令行提示符。在命令行中输入链接对应的序号，按下回车可以用系统默认的浏览器打开该链接。



Zathura 还支持自动重新载入。如果文件被其他应用修改（LCTT 译注：比如在修改 LaTeX 源文件并重新编译得到新的 PDF 之后）， Zathura 会自动重载修改后的文件。

你还可以安装 插件 来扩展 Zathura 的功能，比如阅读 漫画comics 或 PostScript 文件。

tool that has many users today can easily be eclipsed by something better
next week.  Even in this environment, though, some programs endure for a
long time.  As an example, consider the
PostgreSQL database system, which traces its
history back to 1986.  Making fundamental changes to a large code base
with that much history is never an easy task.  As fundamental changes go,
moving PostgreSQL away from its process-oriented model is not a small one,
but it is one that the project is considering seriously.]]></summary>

I’m Julien and I built a recommendation engine for Hacker News.
I feel like this website is a gold mine. Every day, I find some very interesting stories about a topic. And sometimes, I want to find other stories covering that same topic but I can’t.
Hacker News has years of history of awesome discussion and ressources. Unfortunately, I think HN Algolia isn’t helpful in searching these old threads. As a student, I want to learn a lot from this website.
This is why I created HN Recommend. Input a sentence or the URL of an article, and get the most popular and similar posts from Hacker News.
About the technical details, I've computed the embeddings of over 100,000 articles from HN and indexed it using Faiss. I made a blog post for a deeper explanation.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[PostgreSQL 超过 MySQL 成为开发者首选数据库

Stack Overflow 2023 年 5 月的调查显示，45.55% 的受访者使用 PostgreSQL，而 MySQL 为 41.09%，SQLite 为 30.9%。三年前，同样的调查中，MySQL 占 55.6%，PostgreSQL 占 36.1%。需要注意的是，这是一个开发者调查，它并不反映生产中的使用情况。此外，微软的 SQL Server 是排名最高的全商业数据库引擎，使用比例为 25.45%，比 2020 年的 33% 有所下降。


消息来源：Dev Class



老王点评：其实 PostgreSQL 在特性方面一直比 MySQL 好，但是这十多年来就一直被 MySQL 压着打。我接触的第一个开源数据库是 PostgreSQL 而不是 MySQL。现在似乎 MySQL 有点颓势了，而 PostgreSQL 多年的坚持得到了开发者们的认可。如果你是开发者，你会考虑选择哪个呢？




红帽准备开发 CentOS Stream 10

根据红帽工程师分享的 Fedora Enterprise Linux Next（ELN） 计划，推出 CentOS Stream 10 的进程正在进行中，这将最终形成 Red Hat Enterprise Linux（RHEL）10 的基础。预计将在 7 月把所有 Fedora ELN 内容大量导入 CentOS Stream 10。CentOS Stream 的目标是在明年 2 月的 Fedora 40 之前，不与 Fedora 分叉。预计 RHEL 10 将在 2025 年发布。


消息来源：Phoronix



老王点评：无论如何，我都觉得红帽放弃 CentOS 的战略是一大败笔，至少这件事可以做的更好。当然，任何决定背后都有其根本利益的驱动，红帽这样做无可厚非，只是如今这个局面可能是他们最初也没预料的吧。




英特尔简化其 CPU 品牌组合

英特尔已经宣布从下一代 Meteor Lake CPU 开始对其处理器品牌进行一些改变。最小的变化是，英特尔的主流 CPU 将失去其 “i”，从 Core i3/i5/i7/i9 转变为简单的 Core 3/5/7/9。英特尔还将停止在其处理器品牌中使用 “代” 的信息 —— 不会有被宣传为 “第 14 代” 的新 CPU，但会在 CPU 编号中包含世代编号。这是英特尔处理器品牌战略更广泛调整的一部分。去年，该公司放弃了低端笔记本电脑 CPU 的奔腾和赛扬品牌名称，它现在将这些英特尔处理器称为英特尔处理器。


消息来源：Ars Technica



老王点评：这些 CPU 厂商的命名真是有点随意，编号和实际的技术有时候有点脱节。]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[如果你正在找寻适合你的系统的完美发行版，那么选择基于 Ubuntu 的发行版的可能性非常高。

你可能会问为什么。

嗯，毫不奇怪，Ubuntu 是 最适合初学者的 Linux 发行版之一。它也非常流行，这就是为什么你会发现它拥有庞大的用户社区。不仅如此，它还广泛用于 云服务器 上。

因此，将 Ubuntu 作为 Linux 发行版的基础应该带来一些有用的优势，对吧？

这就是为什么我列出了基于 Ubuntu 的最佳发行版清单，希望你能找到一款足够出色，让你停止频繁更换发行版的选择。

1、Ubuntu 官方衍生版



如果你不喜欢 Ubuntu 官方提供的 GNOME 桌面环境，你可以尝试官方衍生版，它们在 Ubuntu 的基础上提供了不同的桌面环境。

简单来说，你将得到同样的 Ubuntu 使用体验，但拥有不同的用户界面。

为了让你的用户体验更加愉快，这些桌面环境已经进行了预调整和主题设置，这使它们成为了那些希望拿来即用的完美选择。

以下是可用的选项：


Kubuntu（KDE Plasma）

Lubuntu（最节约资源的选择，使用 LXDE/LXQT）

Ubuntu Studio（面向创作者的发行版）

Ubuntu Budgie（Budgie 桌面环境）

Ubuntu Kylin（专为中国用户定制）

Ubuntu MATE（使用 MATE 桌面和工具）

Xubuntu（Xfce 桌面）


此外，你还可以在 Ubuntu 22.10 中发现一个带有经典 Unity 桌面环境的新的官方衍生版，因为 Ubuntu Unity Remix 现已成为官方 Ubuntu 衍生版。


解析：我应该使用哪个 Ubuntu 版本？

帕斯卡（Blaise Pascal）生于1623年6月19号，死于1662年8月19号，只活了三十九岁。十七世纪是所谓“天才的世纪”，弗朗西斯·培根死的时候，帕斯卡刚刚三岁；开普勒出版《世界的和谐》时，帕斯卡四岁；伽利略出版《两大世界的对话》时，帕斯卡九岁；霍布斯和伽利略在佛罗伦萨第一次见面时，帕斯卡大概十一岁。帕斯卡比他的法国同胞梅森（Marin Mersenne，1588生）、笛卡尔（1596生）、费马（1607生）以及英国人霍布斯（1588生）、意大利人托里拆利（1608生）晚一辈，又比牛顿（1642/1643生）和莱布尼兹（1646生）早一辈。和他同代的人有英格兰人沃里斯（1616生）和洛克（1632生）、荷兰人惠更斯（1629生），还有塞法迪犹太人斯宾诺莎（1632生）。1607年徐光启回上海老家守丧，三年后回京，利玛窦已逝，只翻译了六卷的《几何原本》就此搁置。徐光启死时，帕斯卡十岁。 
帕斯卡的父亲热爱数学和科学，在帕斯卡十一岁时去掉官职（一说卖掉一说让给弟弟），定居巴黎。帕父和神父出身的数学家梅森交好，梅森家是巴黎学者们聚会的沙龙，帕斯卡父子是常客。梅森府也被称为巴黎邮政局，因为他通过通信和欧洲的一百四十位数学家和科学家保持联系，研究成果到他这里汇总，再被他广播出去。梅森认为知识应该被广泛传播，这点和培根相似——中世纪教会保留的学术传统是知识应该保密，一元三次和四次方程的求解历史反映了当时数学家之间为了保密而引发的各种勾心斗角。梅森的通信网络也称“梅森学院”（Mersenne Academy），后来演变成非正式的“巴黎学院”，是法国科学院的前身。 

梅森

帕斯卡有个姐姐吉尔伯特，比他大三岁。她非常疼爱自己天才的弟弟，在帕斯卡死的当年，写过一本五十页的帕斯卡传记《帕斯卡先生的一生》，她的孩子们也努力维护舅舅的名声。帕斯卡有个妹妹雅克琳，比…]]></summary>

本系列假定你对 Linux 终端比较熟悉。你不必精通，但了解基础知识会很好。我建议阅读终端基础知识系列。

这个系列适合谁？

任何想开始学习 Bash Shell 脚本的人。

如果你是一名将 Shell 脚本作为课程的一部分的学生，那么本系列适合你。

如果你是普通的桌面 Linux 用户，本系列将帮助你了解在探索各种软件和修复程序时遇到的大多数 Shell 脚本。你还可以使用它来自动执行一些常见的重复性任务。

到本 Bash 基础系列结束时，你应该能够编写简单到中等水平的 Bash 脚本。

该系列的所有章节都有示例练习，你可以边做边学。


🚧 你将在这里学习 Bash Shell 脚本。虽然还有语法基本相同的其他 Shell，但它们的行为在某些方面仍然存在差异。Bash 是最常见和通用的 Shell，因此学习 Shell 脚本从 Bash 开始吧。


你的第一个 Shell 脚本：Hello World！

打开一个终端。现在 创建一个新目录 来保存你将在本系列中创建的所有脚本：

mkdir bash_scripts


现在 切换到这个新创建的目录：

cd bash_scripts


让我们在这里 创建一个新文件：

touch hello_world.sh


现在，编辑该文件 并向其中添加一行 echo Hello World。你可以使用 cat 命令的追加模式（使用 >）执行此操作：

[abhishek@itsfoss]:~/bash_scripts$ cat > hello_world.sh 
echo Hello World
^C


我更喜欢在使用 cat 命令添加文本时添加新行。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[仇恨的恶劣影响早已有之。但如今，新型通信技术进一步扩大了仇恨的规模和影响，发布仇恨言论已成为在全球范围内传播分裂言论和思想最常用的方法之一。6月18日是第二个打击仇恨言论国际日，联合国秘书长古特雷斯呼吁人们防止和消除这种破坏性的不良现象，促进包容、公正、和平的社区和社会。


古特雷斯表示，仇恨言论被用来煽动恐惧和分裂，往往是为了政治利益，给社区和社会带来巨大代价。仇恨言论煽动暴力，加剧紧张关系，阻碍促进调解和对话的努力。与此同时，仇恨言论还是种族灭绝和其他暴行罪的征兆之一。但在仇恨言论面前，我们远非无能为力。我们可以而且必须提高对其危险性的认识，并努力防止和消除所有形式的仇恨言论。


与此同时，古特雷斯对借口打击仇恨言论实则侵犯人权的行为发出警示。他指出，对仇恨言论错误和模棱两可的反应，包括全面禁止和关闭互联网，也可能因限制言论和表达自由而侵犯人权。他警告说，这甚至可能使一些最适合反击仇恨言论的人——人权维护者和记者保持沉默。


他指出，联合国正在就数字平台信息完整性自愿行为准则与各国政府、技术公司和其他方面进行磋商，以减少错误和虚假信息及仇恨言论的传播，同时保护表达自由。

AI 模型是建立在人类劳动的基础之上的，高质量的数据标注对 AI 模型至关重要，AI 公司通常会雇佣廉价的众包工人做一些数据标注工作。但研究显示，随着 AI 聊天机器人，如 ChatGPT 的流行，众包工人开始利用 AI 做这些数据标注的工作。瑞士洛桑联邦理工学院的研究人员招募了 44 名众包工人来对 16 篇医学研究论文总结摘要，根据记录的击键情况，比如按下复制快捷键等，他们估计有 33-46% 的摘要文本是用 AI 生成的。


消息来源：The Register



老王点评：还记得前两天我们的#1032 期报道吗，显然这种 AI 吃 AI 的狗粮的事情已经在发生，并且会越来越多。而且，AI 真的能分清楚哪些是 AI 生成的么？可能会越来越难。




FreeBSD 本月庆祝其三十岁生日

1993 年 6 月 19 日，从 386BSD 项目中分裂出来的 FreeBSD 正式有了这个名字。但第一个正式版本直到 1993 年 11 月才发布。FreeBSD 14 将于未来几个月后发布，晚于预期计划。


消息来源：FreeBSD



老王点评：虽然不如 Linux 那么流行，但是 FreeBSD 仍然是一个独特而重要的操作系统。当然，这里面故事很多，感兴趣的朋友可以了解一下。




GPT-4 生成的商业计划书更受投资者青睐

虽然用 AI 撰写商业计划书能节约很多时间，但更重要的是，AI 撰写的比人类撰写的更好，更吸引投资。有公司邀请了数百名投资者和企业主对一组由人类创造和 GPT-4 生成的商业计划书进行评分，他们并不知道有 AI 参与撰写。而且，其中人类撰写的计划书来自于已经获得融资的成功案例。结果显示 GPT-4 生成的商业计划书比人类更有效，被认为在质量、关键要素描述和问题描述上胜过人类。调查显示，在投资者和企业主阅读了 GPT-4 的计划书之后，投资可能性为人类的三倍，他们认为 AI 生成计划书的说服力是人类的两倍。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[胡晓江（章静绘）

胡先骕（1894-1968）先生是中国植物学的奠基人，在中国近代科学史上具有重要地位，同时也是中国近代文学史上的重要人物，在新文化浪潮汹涌澎湃的年代，他始终坚持文化保守主义的立场，创作了大量诗词古文。此外，他还是一位教育家和有高度责任感的社会评论家。2023年5月24日，时值胡先骕一百三十岁虚岁诞辰，《胡先骕全集》在国家植物园举行了首发式。《全集》主编、北京师范大学教授胡晓江是胡先骕的孙女。在接受《上海书评》专访时，她讲述了《全集》的编纂过程，并对祖父胡先骕的生平及学术做了介绍。

《胡先骕全集》（共十九卷），江西人民出版社2023年5月版

能请您聊聊《胡先骕全集》的缘起吗？
胡晓江：《全集》是从2014年启动的。胡先骕是1894年生人，2014年是他的诞辰一百二十周年，江西师范大学举办了很大规模的“胡先骕教育思想研讨会”。江西师范大学是国立中正大学的“嫡传”，胡先骕是中正大学的首任校长。在会议期间有人提出，是时候为胡先骕编一部《全集》了。当然，这并非一时兴起，而是早已有了积累。对胡先骕有一点了解的人，都知道胡先骕不仅是一位科学家，还特别能写，他写诗、写文学批评、写社会评论，身后留下了很多文字。所以，对他的文章著作的搜集、整理，以及对他生平的研究，从上世纪八十年代就已经开始了。最早是中正大学在台湾的校友谭峙军先生，他对老校长念念不忘，晚年花了很多时间搜集、整理胡先骕发表在各处的诗词。在胡先骕百年诞辰的时候出版了《胡先骕先生诗集》（中正大学台湾校友会，1992年）。后来，胡先骕的另一位学生张大为和我的大伯父胡德熙、我父亲胡德焜一起，编了两卷本《胡先骕文存》（江西高校出版社，1995、1996年）。此外，学者胡宗刚在他担任研究员的庐山植物园发现了很多与胡先骕相关的档案资料，在此基础上做了很多研究，写了传记《不该遗忘的胡先骕》（长江文艺出版社，2005年），…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[你的笔记本电脑就像一块空白的画布，可以用来展示个性化的装饰。你最喜欢的贴纸是什么？参与我们的调查，然后看看其他开源爱好者都说了些什么。


去年 12 月刚刚换了工作用的笔记本电脑后，我意识到我有多么喜欢给我的工作设备贴贴纸。这些贴纸有些是过去活动的纪念品，有些是我热衷的项目的标志，还有一些则只是为了好玩！

因为好奇别人的笔记本上贴了什么，我对周围的同事朋友问了一圈。

无障碍倡导者



这是我的工作笔记本电脑（你能看出我对 Drupal 的热爱吗）。我最喜欢的贴纸是有轮椅的 Druplicon... 当 Drupal 8 发布时，我们把这个标志 和轮椅结合在一起，因为我所在的机构专注于无障碍性。

— AmyJune Hineline

充满活力的 Java



自从我还是个孩子的时候，我的电脑和其他东西上就一直有贴纸。我认为我最喜欢的要么是 “Tux”，要么是 “Linux Inside”。它们大多与领域相关，只有一些不相关的。在右下角，我有一个运行在“汤姆猫”上的 Java 贴纸（哈哈）- 这是我职业生涯中花费大部分时间的领域。

— Alan Formy-Duval

实用目的



嗯，我没有贴任何贴纸。然而，我在我的两台笔记本电脑上粘了绒面条，用来固定我的移动硬盘，这样我在公交车上玩游戏时就不会掉落了。我还粘了一个锁槽。

— Rikard Grossman-Nielsen

保持外观



虽然这不是最装饰得最多的笔记本电脑，但我喜欢这套集合（你知道的，很难在没有旅行的情况下获得更多！）

我最喜欢的是“最后一个提交的人是维护者”。这是对维护状态的讽刺性评论，也承诺代码将因此而继续存在。

主要是关于我使用或贡献的事物，我认为有意义，或者只是觉得这个贴纸很棒。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[出于研究目的需要下载 YouTube 视频吗？ Tube Downloader 可以提供帮助。




找到了你想要保存以供离线使用的 YouTube 视频，同时又想不选择他们的付费计划？

好吧，那么你可以使用 Tube Downloader。它是 “yt-dlp” 的前端，提供了一些简洁的功能。


🚧 未经许可下载 YouTube 视频是违反平台政策的。因此，这些工具在官方商店中不可用。我们不鼓励你将该工具用于非法目的，仅提及该工具用于研究和实验目的。


Tube Downloader：概述 ⭐



Tube Downloader 主要使用 C# 编写，是一个跨平台的开源工具，可让你轻松直接从 YouTube 下载视频。

请允许我向你展示此应用的功能。

当你启动应用时，“添加下载Add Download”按钮会显示一个友好的问候语。单击它以添加 YouTube 视频 URL，然后单击“验证Validate”。



当你这样做时，你将看到用于选择文件格式、质量、字幕、保存位置等的选项。


📋 你可以选择 MP3 作为仅下载音频的文件格式。


单击“下载Download”开始下载视频。



你会在主页面上看到下载进度，你可以在其中看到视频的标题以及 URL 和下载速度。

此外，Tube Downloader 在下载完成时显示通知； 但是当我测试它时，它有点不稳定。



那不是全部。Tube Downloader 也有一些不错的自定义选项，例如：


适配系统主题。

在后台运行。

能够限制最大并发下载量。

设置下载速度限制。

选择使用 “Aria2” 作为替代下载器。

启用/禁用在下载的视频中包含元数据。

停止/重试所有下载并清除所有排队的下载。




这些可以从功能区菜单下的“首选项Preferences”访问。

看到 Linux 客户端工作得相当好，Tube Downloader 对于下载那些令人上瘾的快乐的猫咪模因和其他东西是很有用的 🐱 （我们不做评价）。

这个名为 Tunnel Falls 的处理器是一款 12 量子比特的芯片，虽然远远落后于英特尔的许多竞争对手的量子比特数量，但英特尔正试图建立基于硅的量子比特，而其它的量子处理器厂商都在通过云服务提供量子处理器。这些量子比特基于“量子点”，这些结构比材料中的电子波长还要小。量子点可以用来捕获单个电子，然后可以处理电子的特性来存储量子信息。英特尔利用其制造专长来制作量子点，并创造出设置和读取其状态以及执行操作所需的所有邻近功能。

谷歌利用 YouTube 开发其下一代人工智能

据透露，谷歌的研究人员一直在利用 YouTube 开发其下一个大型语言模型 “双子座Gemini”，该模型展示了在其他任何模型中都看不到的多模态能力。而 OpenAI 也已经秘密地使用了 YouTube 的数据来训练其一些人工智能模型，但谷歌能够拥有 YouTube 更全面的视频数据。人工智能开发者在寻找用于训练和改进模型的高质量数据方面面临着新的障碍。从 Reddit 到 Stack Exchange 再到 DeviantArt 的主要网站出版商正越来越多地阻止开发者为该目的下载数据。


消息来源：The Information



老王点评：人工智能下面一个竞争优势就是，看谁拥有大量的数据。所以，我有点明白 Reddit、Twitter 为什么要对其 API 收高价了，可能广告的流失可能并不是主要的原因，因为这种情况并不是第一天存在了。




Meta 公司希望人们能利用其开源人工智能赚钱

Meta 公司正在研究如何将其开源的大语言模型的下一个版本用于商业用途，他们希望其他公司自由使用 Meta 正在开发的新人工智能软件并从中获利，这一决定可能会对其他人工智能开发者和越来越多地采用它的企业产生重大影响。随着开发者采用和改进这些 Meta 开源的模型或修补其安全漏洞，Meta 也将能够把这些改进纳入其自己的消费者和广告产品的人工智能模型中。


消息来源：The Information



老王点评：Meta 公司显然是走一条弯道超车的方法，走开源的路，让其它人无路可走。]]></summary>

它更像是摄影作品。即便摄影师没有向你收取照片的使用费，你仍需要在该署名的地方进行署上来源。据 SFC 的一篇 博文 所述，Copilot 在使用他人的代码片段时，并没有保留来源信息：

“这反映了 GitHub 长期以来的问题，也是我们必须一齐放弃 GitHub 的关键原因。从 Copilot 中，从 GitHub 的代码托管服务中，从我们所见的基本每个领域，我们都发现 GitHub 的行为比其同行要差得多。我们也不相信 Amazon、Atlassian、GitLab 等其他盈利性的代码托管平台，能有杰出的表现。然而，将 GitHub 的行为与其同行相对比较一下，就能发现 GitHub 的行为要差得多了。”

GitHub 是全世界事实上的开源代码仓库。它是 YouTube、Twitter 和 Reddit 的混合体，但专为程序员及其代码服务。自然，替代品是有的。但是，从一个代码仓库生态切换到另一个，并不等同于用 Instagram 来替代 TikTok。微软在 2018 年花了 70 多亿美元来收购 GitHub。从那时起，微软就利用其 OpenAI 的主要受益者的地位，来共同开发 Copilot。并且，要访问 Copilot 服务，只能通过微软的特别邀请，或者支付订阅费。该举激怒了 SFC 及其他开源倡导者，因为微软和 OpenAI 实际上在将他人的代码货币化，同时让使用这些代码的人们不能正确地表明归属信息。

Copilot 必须毁灭。或者，微软和 OpenAI 可以造一台时光机，然后穿越到过去，将 Copilot 数据库中的每一点数据做标记，从而能够为所有输出提供正确的署名。但是，与其去关心你产品或者服务中的伦理问题，不如去鼓动人们，去开拓那荒野西部似的监管环境，后者总是更加简单的。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[pipx 解决了流行的 pip 工具的不足之处。学习在 Linux 中安装和使用 pipx。


pip 是一种流行的工具，用于从 Python 包索引 中安装 Python 包和模块。

然而，在最近的发行版本中，pip 用户遇到了 外部管理环境错误。



这是为避免通过 pip 安装的 Python 包与本机包管理器之间发生冲突而添加的“功能”。Python 希望你使用单独的虚拟环境，而不是通过 pip 在全局安装包。

这就是 pipx 发挥作用的地方。它为你安装的每个应用创建一个新的虚拟环境，然后在全局级别的 /bin 中创建到本地二进制文件的链接。这一切都是自动的。它为你节省时间和精力。

让我们看看如何在 Ubuntu 和其他 Linux 发行版上安装和使用 pipx。

在 Ubuntu 和其他 Linux 上安装 pipx

安装很简单，可以在 Ubuntu 和 Debian 上使用以下命令安装：

sudo apt update && sudo apt install pipx


对于其他发行版，请使用你的包管理器并安装它。

完成安装后，将其添加到 $PATH 以便可以从任何地方访问它：

pipx ensurepath




关闭终端并重新启动它。这就完成了！ 现在，让我们看看如何使用它。

使用 pipx

包管理器的主要用途是什么？ 软件包安装、更新和删除。

让我向你展示如何使用 pipx 执行以下操作：


搜索包

包安装

升级

包移除


让我们从安装开始。

如何使用 pipx 安装包

要使用 pipx 安装包，你必须遵循一个简单的命令语法：

pipx install <package_name>


例如，在这里，我安装了一个非常有用的程序 Cowsay：

pipx install cowsay




同样，如果你想安装特定版本的包，你必须在 == 后跟上版本号，如下所示：

pipx install package==version


例如，在这里，我安装了 1.24.1 版本的 numpy：

pipx install numpy==1.24.1




如何搜索包

pipx 程序没有搜索功能（因为 PyPI 的 API 使用限制）但这并不意味着你不能搜索 Python 包。

要搜索包，你需要安装 pypisearch：

pipx install pypisearch


完成后，你可以使用 pypisearch 命令搜索包：

pypisearch python_package_name


在这里，我搜索了 neofetch：



如何使用 pipx 升级包

与任何其他现代包管理器一样，你可以一次升级所有包，也可以一次升级一个包。

要一次升级所有软件包，你只需执行以下命令：

pipx upgrade-all




如你所见，它将 numpy 升级到最新版本。

但是如果你想升级一个特定的包，你可以这样做：

pipx upgrade package-name


假设我想将 cowsay 包升级到最新版本，那么，我将使用以下命令：

pipx upgrade cowsay




如何使用 pipx 卸载包

要删除包，你必须使用 uninstall 标志，如下所示：

pipx uninstall package_name


为了供你参考，在这里，我从我的系统中删除了 numpy：

pipx uninstall numpy




pip 还是 pipx？

对 pip 的限制影响了最终用户对它的使用。值得庆幸的是，pipx 提供了急需的替代方案。它符合使用虚拟环境的 Python 准则，同时允许已安装的应用在全局范围内可用。

对于不是 Python 应用开发的最终用户，这提供了使用发行版仓库中不可用的 Python 应用的选项。

希望本教程对你有所帮助。如果你有任何问题或建议，请告诉我。

        <id>https://www.williamlong.info/archives/7199.html</id>
        <link href="https://www.williamlong.info/archives/7199.html"/>
        <updated>2023-06-17T03:04:41.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[昆汀·塔伦蒂诺（Quentin Tarantino），1963年3月27日生于美国田纳西州的挪克斯维尔，美国导演、编剧、演员、制作人。他电影的特色为非线性叙事的剧情、讽刺题材、暴力美学、架空历史以及新黑色电影的风格。有人曾说，近二十年内，对当代好莱坞影响最大的三位导演，当属昆汀·塔伦蒂诺、詹姆斯·卡梅隆和克里斯托弗·诺兰。


昆汀·塔伦蒂诺的电影叫好又叫座。他曾获得多项大奖，其中包括两座奥斯卡金像奖、四座金球奖、两座英国电影学院奖和金棕榈奖，并还提名过黄金时段艾美奖与格莱美奖。他受《时代杂志》于2005年评为“全球100名最具影响力的人物”。影评人及历史学家彼得·博格丹诺维奇也曾称他为“在他那世代中最有影响力的导演”。


昆汀曾说，自己这一生只拍十部电影，拍完就金盆洗手。昆汀自29岁开始执导第一部长片电影，27年间，由昆汀独立完成的有九部电影，每部都是经典之作，可以说，从未失手。


下面我们就盘点一下昆汀的这九部电影。


《落水狗》


这部电影是塔伦蒂诺的处女作，展现了他独特的对话风格，黑色幽默，暴力美学和非线性叙事。影片开头就是大段话唠，几个人的个性鲜明，故事讲述了一群不知道彼此真实身份的劫匪在一次抢劫珠宝店的过程中遭遇了警方的埋伏，随后在一个仓库里相互怀疑，想要揪出卧底的故事。很想知道，最后卧底告诉白先生自己是警察后，白先生的心理阴影。





《低俗小说》


影片情节跌宕起伏，剧情引人入胜，人物形象特色分明，叙事和拍摄手法非常独特，剧情的切换幅度很大。“低俗”的内容充斥着影片：性、毒品、暴力、杀人、抢劫、黑帮等等，人物形象特色分明，长得都很有喜感，演员表演也很经典，风情万种的蜜尔（很正点），备受老大女人诱惑的文森（风流倜傥，死的很冤），“放下屠刀，立地成佛”的黑人杀手朱思（从杀手到哲学家），倒霉的黑帮老大（暴菊黑屋子的剧情太搞了），优雅处事且老道的沃夫先生（专门帮忙解决麻烦），在餐馆抢劫的搞笑男女劫匪（笨贼一箩筐）。布鲁斯·威利斯竟然在里面做配角拳击手，实在浪费。拳击手的女友娇小柔弱，和彪悍的拳击手配在一起真绝了。 





《危险关系》


这部片大概是昆汀·塔伦蒂诺电影里知名度最低的之一，感觉女主角选的不好，让人没啥印象（可能主要原因是不好看），女配角的命运还真惨，莫名其妙就当了枪下亡魂。





《杀死比尔》


影片讲述了女主角在自己的婚礼上遭到了前任恋人“比尔”和他的杀手团队的袭击，陷入了昏迷四年的状态，醒来后决心报复的故事。画面血腥，昆汀暴力美学的经典之作。





《金刚不坏》


讲述了一个变态杀手驾驶着一辆改装过的汽车，专门追杀年轻女子的故事。这部B级片相对昆汀的其他作品来说并不出众，话唠的内容不如《低俗小说》，血腥的内容不如《杀死比尔》，前半部分使用胶片电影滤镜，很有胶片感，影片依旧是暴力、血腥，影片中间的一段舞曲《Down in Mexico》令人印象深刻，明确表明昆汀依旧恋足。





《无耻混蛋》


美丽少女苏珊娜的悲惨身世颇令人同情，她身负灭门的血海深仇，每一天都活在复仇的回忆中，她面对德军的勇气，谋划复仇计划的谋略也令人佩服和欣赏，然而，导演不会给观众一段《基督山复仇记》一般的完美情节，在最后计划几乎已经快要实施成功的时候，用一段教课书式的“暴力美学”结束了少女的生命，令人唏嘘不已。 看过这片子后，感觉很纠结。影片看起来感觉很爽，又有些感觉不爽，影片好像挺文雅，但似乎又好像挺流氓，影片似乎是抗德神剧，但似乎又有哪里不对。 不用纠结了，昆汀·塔伦蒂诺的神剧，看就是了。





《被解救的姜戈》


影片讲述了一位名叫姜戈的黑人奴隶，在一位白人赏金猎人的帮助下获得了自由并解救自己的妻子的故事。克里斯托弗·瓦尔兹扮演的赏金猎人令人印象深刻，他处决治安官那段剧情简直令人拍手叫绝。





《八恶人》


剧情发生在南北战争结束后不久，八个陌生人因为暴风雪而被困在一间客栈，每个人都隐藏着不同的秘密和目的，而这间客栈也成为了一座充满死亡和血腥的战场。《八恶人》和《龙门客栈》有很多相似之处，都是在客栈等候并伏击押送的犯人，都有一扇被反复踹开的门，一个是在酒里下毒，一个是在咖啡下毒，不同的是，本片有大量昆汀风格的话痨、血浆以及爆蛋。





《好莱坞往事》


这部电影对观众的要求很高，观众如果不知道1969年轰动洛杉矶的“曼森杀人案”的详细经过，以及嬉皮士运动的历史，那么看这部电影一定是莫名其妙一头雾水，心里想着，这导演拍的什么玩意儿。为了不影响观影效果，建议看前先了解一下“曼森杀人案”的背景和经过。]]></summary>

当被问及阿里巴巴创始人马云的近况时，埃文斯表示，“马云现在对这家公司的关心程度与他刚创立公司时一样，我预计只要阿里巴巴和马云还在，这种情况就会持续下去。”


“Jack（马云）很有活力，他很好，他很开心。他正在东京的一所大学教书，并且有更多时间待在中国。”埃文斯表示。


东京大学官网信息显示，马云已经被聘任为东京大学教授（客座教授），在留时间为2023年5月1日-2023年10月31日。


据了解，马云将从事的领域包括就重要的研究主题提供建议，以及就管理和创业开办讲座。


另据一位微博博主的爆料，6月12日晚，东京学院与东京大学全球领导力项目（GLP）推广办公室合作，举办了一场关于创新和创业的特别研讨会。


该研讨会主要针对GLP-GEfIL学生在国际社会中培养领导才能的问题，由客座教授马云主持，教室里坐满了代表日本、中国、印度和马来西亚等多元化和全球化的学生。


据悉，讲座以马云的丰富经验和开拓创新的知识为基础，重点介绍了他对年轻一代的启示，包括他的管理理念和如何吸引未来，之后，在场的学生从不同角度提出了一系列尖锐的问题，与马云客座教授进行了热烈的交流。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Reddit 威胁换掉继续抗议的子区管理员

本周初，数千 Reddit 子区 闭版 以抗议 Reddit API 的天价收费，因为这事实上扼杀了管理员们赖以执行管理操作的第三方客户端。Reddit CEO 对员工 表示 不要担心，因为抗议不会影响公司收入。他称，“大部分子区会按计划在周三回归，我们干好自己的工作就行了”。周三，部分子区陆续恢复，但也有很多子区将继续保持关闭 —— 直到 Reddit 改变其政策。目前还有超过一半的子区保持关闭或限制，这包括订阅数超过四千万的 r/funny、超过三千万的 r/aww、r/Music 等。此外，Reddit 还威胁将移除继续抗议的管理员。Reddit 宣称，如果一个子区的管理团队一致同意停止管理社区，它将邀请愿意管理社区的新管理员来管理社区；而如果至少有一名管理员愿意维持社区运作，Reddit 将移除不想管理社区的管理员。


消息来源：Hacker News



老王点评：真是要硬扛到底啊，这不是移除几个“刺头”管理员就能解决问题的，相信这样的抗议也代表了大部分社区中坚的意见。无论如何，这都是一幕罕见的大规模社区对抗事件，让我们拭目以待。




YouTube 通知其开源替代品 Invidious 关闭

Invidious 是 YouTube 的一个开源 “替代前端”，允许用户在没有数据跟踪的情况下观看 YouTube 视频，也可以让用户在观看视频时不被 “恼人的广告” 打断。YouTube 声称该软件违反了其 API 政策，称它没有显示 YouTube 服务条款的链接，也没有 “明确” 解释其对用户信息的处理。YouTube 要求它在 7 天内关闭。


消息来源：VICE



老王点评：看来开放 API 将全面进入关闭时代，各个网站都开始扼杀这些妨碍其广告业务的客户端了。或许在官方看来，这些利用其 API 的第三方客户端就是在对它们吸血。




Alphabet 出售了谷歌域名产品

Alphabet 正在结束其谷歌域名业务，并将其资产以约 1.8 亿美元的价格出售给 SquareSpace。这些资产包括“在谷歌域名业务上托管的 1000 万个域名，分布在数百万个客户中”。谷歌域名业务于 2014 年推出，在 2022 年退出了测试阶段。它拥有诸多新的顶级域名，是 HTTPS 的主要支持者之一。


消息来源：9to5google



老王点评：谷歌连域名这么重要的基础设施服务都开始砍掉，以后还能信任谷歌在基础设施方面的持续性么？]]></summary>

任何一个转弯都可能引向天堂
或者，任何角落都可能隐藏着地狱
道路闪亮，像雨后上山的河流。
——爱德华·托马斯
1914年12月至1917年1月，在战争的阴霾下，爱德华·托马斯（Edward Thomas）用生命的最后两年时间创作了他一生的诗篇。1917年1月13日，托马斯写下最后一首诗《真爱的悲哀》，两周后，他作为英国皇家炮兵部队少尉赴法国前线。4月9日，在阿拉斯（Arras）“复活节反攻”时被德军炮弹击中身亡。托马斯的一百四十二首诗作在其身后结集出版，被认为是那个时代最伟大的诗歌成就之一。作为十六位战争诗人之一，他的名字被镌刻在伦敦西敏寺诗人角的一块纪念碑上。
爱德华·托马斯生于1878年，十九岁出版第一本散文集《林地生活》。到1914年，在成为诗人之前，他已是著名散文家、传记作家和深具影响力的文学批评家，被《泰晤士报》称为“拥有英格兰诗歌天堂钥匙的人”。那一时期，托马斯还实验性地创作了冥想散文、印象派小说、神话、奇幻故事与寓言，他的写作实践几乎涵盖了所有的文学体裁，如果不是过人的文学禀赋，他或许也会以纯粹的博物学家、自然学家、地形学家、民俗学家或社会历史学家的身份来写作。托马斯广泛而独到的评论遍及自乔叟时代到他同时代的文学作品，既以非凡的洞察力评论同时代作家（哈代、叶芝、劳伦斯、庞德等），也敏锐地倾注于当时名不见经传的文学新人。他第一个意识到威廉·亨利·戴维斯（W. H. Davies）、德拉梅尔（Walter de la Mare）和弗罗斯特的诗歌才华。他积极评价戴维斯的处女作，并鼓励他写下在北美的狂野经历《一个超级流浪汉的自传》，这本书被出版商拒绝，托马斯帮助获得萧伯纳的前言，助力出版；托马斯在评论弗罗斯特的《波士顿以北》…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[在 Linux 中无法打开 AVIF 图片？AVIF 是一种新的网络图像文件格式，下面是在 Linux 桌面上查看 AVIF 图像的方法。


就质量而言，PNG 是最好的，但它们体积庞大，因此不适合用于网站。

JPEG 会减小文件大小，但会显着降低图像质量。

WebP 是一种相对较新的格式，可以生成尺寸更小、质量更好的图像。

现在，AVIF 是一种新的文件格式，可以在不牺牲质量的情况下压缩图像。对于相同的图像质量，它们比 WebP 更小。

最近 Linux 已开始提供 WebP 支持。但是，许多发行版默认不支持 AVIF 图像格式。

如果你从网络上下载 AVIF 格式的图像，它不会显示缩略图。



如果你尝试使用默认图像查看器打开它，它很可能会显示“无法识别的图像文件格式”错误。



那么，解决方案是什么？ 在 Linux 上根本看不了 AVIF 图像吗？

不，事实并非如此。对于 Linux，总有一种解决方法。

在 Linux 中查看 AVIF 图像文件

有一个名为 gThumb 的便捷 图像查看器，可用于在 Linux 上打开 AVIF 图像。

如果不是全部的话，它应该在大多数 Linux 发行版的仓库中可用。

在 Ubuntu 和基于 Debian 的发行版上，使用以下命令安装 gThumb。

sudo apt install gthumb




安装后，选择一张 AVIF 图像，右键单击它并选择“打开方式Open With”选项。在这里，选择 gThumb，将其设为 AVIF 图像的默认值并打开它。



gThumb 在打开的图像下以缩略图格式显示同一文件夹中的所有图像。



使用 gThumb 打开 AVIF 图像后，它们也应该以缩略图显示。



就是这样。你现在可以在 Linux 桌面上欣赏 AVIF 图像。

总结

gThumb 是一个用途极为广泛且功能强大的应用。这让我想知道为什么它不被用作 GNOME 或其他桌面环境和发行版中的默认图像查看器。

关于 Linux 中默认的 AVIF 支持，迟早会添加。目前，gThumb 完成了这项工作。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[我们将介绍一些最佳的虚拟化程序，为用户创建/管理虚拟机提供便利。


虚拟化软件由于其用途和好处而广泛使用，你可以使用它来体验、测试或运行需要特定操作系统版本的软件。

虚拟化提供了一个抽象的计算机硬件概念，帮助你创建虚拟机（VM）、网络、存储等。其好处包括隔离性、安全性和自由度高，可以尽情测试各种事物。

不同类型的虚拟化软件分别适用于桌面用户、服务器管理员和企业用户。

在列出各种虚拟化软件的同时，我还会提到适用对象。

1、VirtualBox



VirtualBox 是一款备受赞誉的开源虚拟机程序，适用于 Linux、Windows 和 macOS。

它适用于各种类型的用户，无论你只是想在虚拟机上运行 Linux，还是想创建一个用于测试的虚拟机，或者是企业需要一个虚拟机解决方案。

对大多数用户来说，它可以被视为一个全能解决方案。虽然它主要适用于桌面使用，但你可以尝试其无头headless模式，通过查阅其 文档，将虚拟机作为远程桌面服务器运行。

主要亮点：


支持广泛的客户操作系统

简单的用户界面和快速的性能

定期更新

功能丰富


2、OpenVZ



想在服务器上创建隔离的 Linux 容器吗？OpenVZ 可以帮助你。

你可以创建行为类似于独立服务器的容器。这些容器具备帮助你高效管理的所有基本功能。

由于 OpenVZ 是作为 Linux 发行版构建和分发的，因此容器仅运行于 Linux 上。

对于初学者来说，OpenVZ 是学习使用容器的绝佳选择，因为它易于配置和管理。此外，与其他一些方案相比，基于 OpenVZ 的 VPS 托管价格实惠。

主要亮点：


资源利用效率高

使用和管理简单


3、KVM

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[安卓开源项目将不是一个完整的开源移动操作系统

安卓开源项目（AOSP）是安卓系统开源的部分，但谷歌不断地将其中一些部分抽取到其私有的谷歌服务框架。最近，谷歌又废弃了 AOSP 中的拨号和消息应用程序，谷歌称，“这个应用程序没有得到积极的支持，其源代码只作为参考。这个项目将在未来的某个时候从源代码清单中删除。”虽然每个安卓 OEM 厂商都已经使用了他们自己的拨号和消息应用，而且也有比谷歌更好的开源替代品，但对于安卓这个开源操作系统来说，由于 AOSP 的功能不断地被转移到闭源的谷歌服务框架中，你将不能说 AOSP 是一个完整的开源移动操作系统了。


消息来源：OS News



老王点评：从谷歌删除“不作恶”信条那时起，开源就不断被它践踏。当然，这并不是谷歌做的有多差，或者违背了开源许可证，在这方面比它差的比比皆是。叹息的是，终究很多公司只是将开源当成一件需要利用时披上的华丽衣服，而在金钱当道时就如旧衣一样丢弃。




Debian 13 将支持 RISC-V 64

Debian 12 已经正式发布，官方支持 AMD64、AArch64、i386、POWER 等架构，但不支持 RISC-V 64 位。不过，对 RISC-V 64 位的移植正在取得良好的进展。在一年半到两年后的 Debian 13 版本中，预计会有对 RISC-V 64 位的支持。考虑到许多社区开源开发者缺乏高性能 RISC-V 硬件，这也是可以理解的。


消息来源：Phoronix



老王点评：如果 Debian 能够支持高性能 RISC-V 架构，将从根本上推动 RISC-V 的发展。




生成型人工智能每年可为全球经济增加 4.4 万亿美元

麦肯锡公司称，生成性人工智能每年可为全球经济增加 “2.6 万亿至 4.4 万亿美元”。这几乎是 “相当于在地球上增加一个规模相当于英国的新国家（其 2021 年 GDP 为 3.1 万亿美元）”。这一数据比该公司在 2017 年的预估上调了 15% 至 40%。生成性人工智能和其他技术有可能使工作自动化，但麦肯锡认为这并不意味着大规模的工作流失，而是“使这些工作的执行速度大大加快”。麦肯锡发现，主要受到影响的工作任务是客户运营、市场和销售、软件工程和研发等工作。


消息来源：Venture Beat



老王点评：虽然如此说，但是一些人失业是不可避免的，就看谁能适应。可以预期的是，人工智能鸿沟会进一步拉大社会差距。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[与你最亲近的人建立一种开放的文化，并带着它走遍天下。


作为 80 年代的叛逆少年，“因为我这么说”是我在家里经常听到的一句话。我并不是一个真正的叛逆者。我只是想让别人听到我的声音，把我看成是一个开始表达自己想法和情感的人。

我那种不被倾听/聆听的感觉让我相信，培养不害怕说话的孩子很重要，但他们也能学会适应。倾听他们的意见，与孩子们合作，也可以帮助他们发挥创造力，最终让他们成为成功组织的一部分。

孩子们如何解释信息

我并没有刻意鼓励孩子们的开放行为，也没有主动告诉孩子们要大声说话。尽管如此，在我大儿子上幼儿园的第一天，他的老师给我们打电话。她告诉我们，当她和全班同学一起讨论不打架、不推搡等规则时，我的孩子举手告诉她，他的父母允许他一直争论和辩论。

这是真的。我让我的孩子们表达自己的意见，并让他们听到。但我孩子的话让我感到惊讶。直到那时我才意识到，虽然我一直在做正确的事情，但事实上，我的孩子们的行为不应该只是对我们教育他们的方式的反应。我们也不应该让他们从二手语境中挑选东西。那一天对我来说是一个游戏规则的改变，践行开放的文化正式主动地进入我们的家庭。

为成长而开放

在我小的时候，父母和长辈是有知识的人。

作为一个孩子，要获得信息并不容易。虽然我被鼓励表达意见，但也只是到了一个规范的、“容易消化”的程度。今天，父母、老师和孩子都有同样的手段来获取数据。你如何处理它，完全取决于你。

例如，在用希伯来语玩 Scattergories 时，“病毒”一词通常是大多数人玩的唯一以 “V” 开头的生物。为了获得更多的分数，我们决定寻找其他符合条件的动物名称。不一会儿，我们就找到了不是一种而是三种新的生物（我孩子的老师认为“小袋鼠”（希伯来语中以 “V” 拼写）不是一种真实的东西，但这是另一个故事）。

我教我的孩子阅读字里行间的内容，决不要不加质疑地接受作为“事实”呈现给他们的东西。这使他们能够练习批判性思维。这也使他们能够质疑我，从而使我们进行公开和透明的讨论。

这些讨论容易吗？不是。我总是有精力进行这些讨论吗？绝对不是。

然而，为了帮助他们练习学会倾听的“肌肉”，这些对话是必须的。

偶尔，我们必须强迫自己找到时间，把注意力集中在家庭上。建立一个强大而开放的文化需要时间，随着人们的变化，你的家庭文化也在变化。你必须适应并努力保持它的活力。作为群体的领导者，我必须为我的孩子们提供一个安全的地方，一个他们可以公开分享自己想法的地方，一个他们有归属感的地方。

在一个家庭中，你们必须合作，共同解决问题。倾听不同的想法和解决问题的方法可以让你想出创造性的（但并不总是符合每个人的喜好）解决方案。

我家里的一个问题是玩电脑游戏时家里的噪音。这种情况大多发生在深夜和周末。我们一起坐下来，想出了一个商定的嘈杂游戏的时间段。从那时起，那些想玩的人知道他们什么时候可以玩，而那些寻求一些安静时间的人也知道这些时间会发生什么。随着孩子们的长大，决定和讨论的性质也发生了变化。

这是否意味着所有的决定都与孩子们分享？不。这是否意味着都是玫瑰花？绝对不是。

鼓励孩子们建立联系可能会以一个破花瓶告终，似乎没有人对此负责。这可能会导致“因为我这么说”来拜访。然而，进行具有挑战性但又具有包容性的对话、鼓励创新思维以及让孩子参与决策都是让他们为成年做好准备的方法。希望它也能让他们成为更好的人（到目前为止，以我的拙见，这运作良好）。

开放的家庭文化

实行开放的文化不是一次性的事情。它是一个旅程，也是一种心态。我相信它为我和我的孩子们提供了工具，使他们在屋内和屋外都能坚韧不拔、思想开放、宽容和充满好奇心。与你最亲近的人建立一种开放的文化，并带着它走遍天下。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[在 Rust 系列的 上一篇文章 中，我介绍了如何使用 if 和 else 关键字来处理 Rust 程序的控制流。

这是处理程序控制流的一种方法。另一种方法是使用循环。因此，让我们在本文中看看循环。

Rust 中可用的循环

Rust 编程语言有三种不同的循环，基于你想要实现什么以及可用的内容：


for

while

loop


我假设你对 for 和 while 已经很熟悉了，但 loop 对你来说可能是个新概念。让我们先从熟悉的概念开始。

for 循环

for 循环主要用于迭代一种称为迭代器的东西。

这个迭代器可以从任何东西中创建，从数组、向量（很快就会介绍！）、一系列值，或者任何自定义的东西。这里的可能性是无限的。

来看看 for 循环的语法。

for 迭代变量 in 迭代器 {
    <语句>;
}


其中的 迭代变量 在大多数其他编程语言教程中通常被称为 i ; )

迭代器 可以是任何东西，只要它能告诉下一个值是什么，如果有的话。

来通过一个程序来理解这个。

fn main() {
    let my_arr = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9];

    println!("迭代数组");
    for element in my_arr {
        println!("{}", element);
    }

    println!("\n迭代一个真正的迭代器");
    for element in my_arr.iter() {
        println!("{}", element);
    }

    println!("\nPython 风格的范围");
    for element in …]]></summary>

东南亚华人华侨的历史久为学界关注，从最早的经济行为入手，继而政治意义、文化衍变传承以及身份认同等各方面都有了优秀的专著和研究文章。并且，在“南洋”这个大的地域概念之下，逐渐细分出不同国家/地区华人华侨在历史上的差异化发展沿革。比如笔者博士求学期间主要研究的新加坡/马来亚华人华侨，和工作后所在泰国的华人华侨，不论是早期华侨时代还是演变至今的华人华裔，都呈现出迥异的生存状态以及认同。李欣祥先生这本《消逝的海外华邦：西婆罗洲华人政权的兴亡》从兰芳公司（1770-1884）这个领域内都有所耳闻的“华人海外共和国”入手，对西婆罗洲曾存在过若干华人政权的缘起、发展和灭亡做了详细的介绍与分析，并试图讨论这些政权尤其是兰芳公司在整个华人历史中可能扮演过的重要且独特的先驱角色（兰芳公司的名称之争历来已久，本文采纳李欣祥先生在书中的叫法，写作兰芳公司）。由于西婆罗洲现今华人群体式微，相关的研究工作不曾大规模开展过，而李欣祥先生将他之前的累积做了一个更有深度和广度的延伸，把西婆罗洲存在过的华人公司作为整体研究对象撰写了《消逝的海外华邦》，为那段西婆罗洲华人公司及政权的历史刻下了重要的印记。
公司（kongsi）还是共和国——如何定义西婆罗洲的华人政权
作者给这本书的题目起得很巧妙，用了“华邦”这个词，因为对兰芳公司的定性几十年来一直有所争议。以荷兰学者高延为代表的一部分学者认为，兰芳公司的领袖大统制角色近乎共和政体下的总统，甚至发展出自己类似议会的议政制度，加上拥有武装力量、税收政策以及对外关系，尤其当时的清政府并没有承认和兰芳的从属关系，完全可以被视作一个独立的国家，所以兰芳公司当之无愧可以被称为“兰芳共和国”。但还有一部分学者认为，兰芳公司并没有脱离东南亚华人群体中“公司（ko…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[从小冰官方公众号获悉，今日小冰公司与网易云音乐宣布达成战略合作，双方联合推出的 AI 歌手音乐创作软件“网易云音乐・X Studio”已正式上线，面向广大音乐人和音乐爱好者免费使用。


据官方介绍，该软件可帮助音乐人轻松创作高质量的 AI 新世代音乐作品，是全球主流音乐平台与人工智能公司联手打造的首个同类产品。软件首发 12 名 AI 歌手，并将不断推新，扩充 AI 歌手阵营。同日，双方还宣布首个虚拟歌手厂牌 WOWAIDO！成立。


网易云音乐・X Studio 支持 Windows 与 macOS 双平台，官方称搭载了丰富的前沿性人工智能小冰黑科技，并经过双方深度合作定制调校。技术方面，包括小冰歌唱模型、一致性超级自然语音、流式渲染歌声合成和视觉神经网络渲染等技术。在演唱方面，可在 3 秒内生成专业歌手水准的 AI 演唱干声，还能通过参数实现 AI 歌手的滑音、转音、颤音、咬字、节奏、音色或强弱变化等，细腻演绎作品效果。X Studio 支持合并 AI 音轨数量高达 30 轨，这意味着让每个音乐人都拥有一支“30 人”合唱团。


官方称，X Studio 的 AI 歌手阵营具备高度拟人及多样化的声线风格，可适配流行、民谣、国风、电子、摇滚等各种曲风，说唱等更多风格也将于近期更新上线。


此次软件首发的 12 名 AI 歌手，组成厂牌 WOWAIDO！正式出道，首张迷你专辑《WOWAIDO！Ⅰ 地心引力》已在网易云音乐上线。其中，成员 AI 何畅等曾先后与马伯骞、卞子严、小柯多位知名音乐人合作。抖音百万粉丝女歌手夏语冰、陈水若，以及在内测阶段呼声较高的若溪、崔璨等，也在首发名单中出现。


官方还称，软件包含高安全性和隐私保护策略，所有 AI 歌手均经过严格的数据训练，所有的创作均可溯源。

乔治·杜比（Georges Duby ）等主编的《女性史·20世纪卷》（原书名A History of Women in the West, Volume V : Toward a Cultural Identity in the Twentieth Century，1992）虽然是三十年前出版的著作，但是我认为在关于二十世纪女性史的研究中该书至今仍然具有重要的权威性，其敏锐的问题意识和开阔的研究视角及方法远未过时。进入二十一世纪以来的性别史、妇女史以及在各种历史研究议题中性别研究视角的研究成果无疑非常丰富，但是在通史、国别史、全球史、跨国史比较研究等整体性层面上的女性研究地位仍远未取得转向性的成果。仅此而言，可以说在历史学科的整体性建构中仍有亟需填补的空缺，而《女性史》在整体性历史研究的面向中，其性别化的研究视角和以性别体系为中心的强调差异性、动态性的方法论无疑仍然具有开拓性的意义。更重要的是在有关二十世纪的女性史叙事中，该书从不同视角揭露了存在于所有社会结构中的性别权力压迫的普遍性，也揭示了在国家主义、民族主义等意识形态制约下的民族国家建构中的性别压迫的复杂性和微观过程。同时，作者们以大量史实和性别理论阐释提醒人们反思和警惕所谓二十世纪的女性故事在本质上是一个进步故事、二十世纪是女性进步时代的断言。该书通过整体性的历史研究揭露和反抗一切性别权力压迫，使女性史研究成为审视历史、理解现实和面向未来的一种有效的方式，我认为是这本女性主义历史叙事著作最值得阅读的理由。

at the advantages and disadvantages of how documentation for PostgreSQL
is written.


	The strengths of this process are also its weaknesses. A developer
	is, by definition, someone who spends the majority of their time
	doing development, which is to say writing code. Updating the
	documentation becomes a task that must be completed so that the
	code one has written can get committed so that one can move on to
	the next project and write some more code. If a change to the
	documentation would be beneficial but is unrelated to any
	particular patch, it's not likely to get done.

	The results are, in a certain sense, pretty comical.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[6 月 14 日消息，在 2023 开放原子全球开源峰会上，阿里云公布 1+4 开源战略，在操作系统、云原生、数据库、大数据四大开源领域之外，AI 模型社区魔搭作为大模型方向的开源新势力首次亮相。据悉，目前已有 15 款支持中文的开源大模型在魔搭社区上线。



开放原子开源基金会是我国首家开源基金会，于 2020 年 6 月在北京成立，由阿里等多家科技企业联合发起，主管单位为工信部。今年，阿里云首次将魔搭社区（ModelScope）带到开放原子全球开源峰会这一顶尖开源大会上。

去年 11 月，阿里与 CCF 开源发展委员会联手推出魔搭社区，初衷就是通过开源开放、共建社区生态的方式，让 AI 开发使用更简单。魔搭社区践行模型即服务（Model as a Service）（MaaS）新理念，提供多类优质 AI 模型以及模型调优、训练、部署等一体化服务，旨在降低AI模型应用门槛。

经过半年左右的发展，魔搭已经成为国内规模最大、最活跃的 AI 模型开源社区，开发者数量超 160 万，模型下载量超 2500 万，累计开源开放了 900 多个优质 AI 模型，包括阿里通义大模型系列、澜舟科技的孟子模型、智谱 AI 的中英双语千亿大模型等 15 款支持中文的开源大模型。魔搭社区现已成为中国 AI 模型开源第一门户。未来，魔搭社区将继续帮助开发者将 AI 模型转化为生产力，持续推动 AI 领域的开源生态建设。



阿里云是开源的受益者，也是积极贡献者。在操作系统领域，阿里云、统信软件等联合发起的龙蜥社区已成为国内领先的操作系统开源社区。在云原生领域，阿里云的开源项目覆盖容器调度、微服务、分布式应用治理等多个重要领域。在数据库领域，阿里云核心产品 PolarDB 数据库 PostgreSQL 版和分布式版已经开源。在大数据领域，Flink 是当下被广泛使用的开源大数据计算引擎之一。

三年来，阿里云一直积极参与开放原子开源基金会建设，积极向基金会捐赠开源项目。龙蜥操作系统在 2021 年 10 月进入基金会孵化流程；阿里云倡议发起云原生工作委员会后，双方就 ACK Distro 和云原生应用脚手架两个开源项目达成捐赠意向。此外，阿里云还深度参与建设了 AtomGit 代码协作平台。

开放原子开源基金会副理事长、阿里云市场总裁刘湘雯在会上表示，未来阿里云将持续拥抱开源生态，持续投入 AI、云原生、数据库、大数据、操作系统等领域的开源工作，持续提升开发者服务和企业创新支持，为开源创新提速。]]></summary>

上周伊朗军方展示了其海军大学开发的“量子处理算法”的首款产品，它能帮助军方探测水面的扰动。但通过媒体公布的“量子”设备图像的分析显示，该设备可能是一款在亚马逊上出售的 FPGA 开发板 ZedBoard，在图像上甚至可以清晰地看到该品牌名。ZedBoard 开发板主要是用于视频处理、可重构计算、电机控制、软件加速等用途，并不具有“量子比特”。

人工智能对人工智能生成的内容进行训练将导致人工智能崩溃

用于训练大型语言模型的数据最初来自人类来源，如书籍、文章、照片等，这些都是在没有人工智能的帮助下创建的。但随着越来越多的人使用人工智能来制作和发布内容，一个明显的问题出现了：当人工智能生成的内容在互联网上扩散时，人工智能模型开始对其进行训练。研究人员发现，“在训练中使用模型生成的内容会导致所产生的模型出现不可逆转的缺陷。”他们研究了文本到文本和图像到图像的人工智能生成模型的概率分布，得出结论：“从其他模型产生的数据中学习会导致模型崩溃 —— 这是一个退化的过程，并且随着时间的推移，模型会忘记真正的基础数据分布。”他们观察到模型崩溃发生得如此之快：模型可以迅速忘记它们最初学习的大部分原始数据。这导致它们随着时间的推移，表现越来越差，错误越来越多。


消息来源：Venture Beat



老王点评：这让我想起了衔尾蛇，一种自己吞噬自己尾巴的蛇。这样下来人工智能失去对世界的真正认知，我们的未来或许再也分不清现实和人工智能虚构的“现实”。




Meta 开源了音乐和图像模型

Meta 公司开源发布了自己的人工智能音乐生成器 MusicGen。它可以将文字描述（例如 “一首 80 年代的流行歌曲，背景音效是重鼓声和合成器垫音效”）变成大约 12 秒的音频。该公司没有提供用于训练模型的代码，但它提供了预训练的模型，任何拥有合适硬件的人，如 16GB 的 GPU 都可以运行。

Meta 也发布了一个 “类似人类” 的人工智能图像创作模型 I-JEPA，训练代码和模型快照发布在 GitHub 上。Meta 称，该模型利用相关世界的背景知识来填补图像的缺失部分，而不是像其他生成性人工智能模型那样只看附近的像素。它使用了类似人类的推理，可以避免人工智能生成的图像中常见的错误，如多了手指的手。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[在安装完 Debian 12 “Bookworm”要做的一些事情。


我想你已经安装好了 Debian 12 “Bookworm” 或者 准备升级 了。Debian 12 经过一年多的开发，于 2023 年 6 月 10 日发布。它带来了最新的软件包、升级和替换一些关键模块。请在此查看 Debian 12 的一些新特性 指南。

如果你在笔记本电脑或台式机上使用 Debian，那么在安装或升级到 Debian 12 后，以下是你可能需要完成的一些步骤。

Debian 12 安装后需要做的几件事情

启用 sudo

如果你将 Debian 12 作为新安装的系统，那么你的用户账户可能没有超级用户访问权限。出于安全原因，Debian 在安装期间不允许任何选项给予用户账户 sudo 访问权限。以下是如何将用户添加到超级用户组。

打开终端并使用 root 密码进入 root 账户。

su


然后运行以下命令，将你的用户账户添加到 sudo 组。请将下面的用户名更改为你的账户。

/sbin/addgroup 用户名 sudo


现在，你可以注销并再次登录该账户。

确保 Debian 已更新至最新版本

在开始工作或进行任何配置之前，确保 Debian 12 已更新至最新版本非常重要。从终端中按以下顺序运行以下命令以刷新 Debian 系统。

sudo apt update
sudo apt upgrade


Debian 12 中的非自由软件

Debian 12 中有一个关于管理“非自由”固件包的根本变化。Debian 创建了一个新的软件源，以便轻松访问那些专有包。因此，如果你想添加非自由软件包，需要确保在 APT 软件源文件 /etc/apt/sources.list 中添加以下行：

sudo nano /etc/…]]></summary>

好吧，我遇到了一个不错的工具 Sniffnet。 它是一个用于实时监控网络活动的简洁的开源应用，也是专有的 GlassWire（如 Portmaster）的一个很好的替代品。

那么，让我们深入挖掘吧！

Sniffnet：概述 ⭐



Sniffnet 是一个基于 Rust 的网络监控工具，可让你跟踪通过系统的所有互联网流量。 它提供了一些非常有用的功能，高级用户肯定会喜欢这些功能**。

当你第一次启动 Sniffnet 时，你会看到一个菜单来选择网络适配器、过滤器和应用协议。

完成选择后，单击“火箭”按钮开始。



这是概览页的样子。它显示了所有当前的网络连接，以及一个方便的流量图，供你分析流量。


📋 你可以选择将数据显示为字节或单个数据包。




要更深入地查看你的网络连接，你可以前往“检查Inspect”选项卡。

在这里，你将看到一个包含所有重要信息的列表，例如 IP 地址、数据包数量、数据量、来源国家等等。

你可以单击各个连接获得更详细的情况。



如果你想为更具体的目的过滤结果怎么办？

好吧，那么你可以使用“检查”选项卡下的过滤器选项根据你的需要过滤结果。

你可以通过以下方式过滤列表： 应用、国家、域名等。

这是它的样子：



Sniffnet 还可以向你显示可以以文本格式导出的连接的详细报告。

只需单击右下角带有页面/向右箭头的徽标即可开始。



可定制性如何？

好吧，Sniffnet 有一组不错的设置供你调整。

第一个是“通知”选项卡，它允许你根据可以设置的各种阈值来设置通知的行为。



然后是可以通过“样式Style”选项卡访问的主题。它提供四种选择，雪人之夜是我的最爱。



最后，“语言Language”选项卡允许你设置你选择的界面语言。



好了，就此结束。

Sniffnet 是一个方便的工具，可以非常详细地了解系统上的网络活动。

你可以使用它来监控你的网络。

此外，与另一个网络监控工具 Nutty 相比，在我看来，Sniffnet 的使用和设置要直观得多。

📥 获取 Sniffnet

Sniffnet 可跨多个平台使用，包括 Linux、Windows 和 macOS。 你可以前往官方网站获取你选择的安装包。


Sniffnet


如果愿意，你还可以在 GitHub 上仔细查看其源代码。

2023年春，《有凤来仪——夏含夷教授七十华诞祝寿论文集》由中西书局正式出版。夏含夷（Edward L. Shaughnessy）是芝加哥大学教授、《剑桥中国上古史》主编。正好夏先生来北京，我专程赴京，4月20日上午、21日晚上分两次对夏先生做了访谈。

《有凤来仪：夏含夷教授七十华诞祝寿论文集》，朱渊清  苏荣誉主编，中西书局2022年12月出版，270.00元

朱渊清：夏先生，这次给您带来了七十岁祝寿的论文集《有凤来仪》，终于出版了。
夏含夷：太好了，非常感谢你。要请你和各位作者给这本书签名。
朱渊清：三十一位中国学者的论文，前些日子已经寄给您电子档，您满意吗？
夏含夷：很满意。我还没有读完。涉及内容实在是太丰富了。
朱渊清：您一辈子从事中国古史研究，取得了巨大的成就，很希望请您谈谈自己的学术经历。
夏含夷：没问题。
朱渊清：您是什么时候如何开始学习中文的，又是如何走上中国古史的研究之路的？
夏含夷：1968年我读高中时正在打越战。1970年我进大学，读的是圣母大学。这是听从了我父亲的建议，不然的话可能就要去当兵。我对思想史有兴趣，大学一年级时遇到两个四年级的朋友，跟着他们听了几门神学课，对中国的道教、禅宗很感兴趣。1972年三年级时，学校终于开了门中文课，老师是香港来的。这是我学中文之始。三年级结束我去参加明德大学暑期班，专门补习中文。明德大学暑期班学习外语特别好，学校周围的风景也很漂亮。
朱渊清：我知道。您的大女儿也在明德大学读过书，学中文。
夏含夷：对。在明德大学暑期班学习外语必须先签一个保证书，保证整个夏天不说英语。老师和学生学习、生活在一起，必须时时讲中文。非常累。
朱渊清：除了中文语言，您对中国文化的兴趣最初是在道教、禅宗。
夏含夷：圣母大学神学系还聘了一个大学者，是芝加哥大学毕业的，我…]]></summary>

《真理与生命》杂志1929年和1930年两期，刊登了李荣芳撰写的两篇《圣地游行记》。《真理与生命》是民国期间极具影响力的基督教刊物，主编为赵紫宸，编辑部成员与“撰述员”基本来自燕京大学宗教学院。这两篇游记，记述了李荣芳于1929年3月到5月在巴勒斯坦地区的两次出游，一次是乘车，“专到紧要的区域”，一次是骑马，“专到闭塞的地方”。
李荣芳（1887-1965）是燕京大学宗教学院教授。相比于吴雷川、赵紫宸这些中国基督教界的名人，他在生前和身后都不是一个响亮的名字。但他有一个独特的背景，是其他民国基督教知识分子所不具备的。李荣芳是在美国受过科班训练的圣经学学者，而不是单纯研究神学的理论家。他于1908年进入汇文大学神科，获得学士和硕士学位。1913年，他进入位于美国新泽西州的德鲁神学院（Drew Theological Seminary，当时译为“芝儒神学院”），大约在1917或1918年获得神学博士。从他的博士导师、博士论文选题、回国后开设的课程、翻译的英文著作以及他自己所撰写的报刊文章，我们可以看到他是一位严谨的圣经学者，而不是泛谈神学义理的神学家。
李荣芳1917年归国，先在自己的母校汇文大学任教。1919年燕京大学成立，汇文大学就是组成燕大的四所教会大学之一，所以李荣芳也就成为燕京大学神学院教授（后改为“宗教学院”）。创校之初，教员中只有两位中国教师，李荣芳便是其中一位，主要教授圣经希伯来文和旧约。根据1931年燕京大学宗教学院的课程大纲，李荣芳开设多门与旧约有关的专业课。在“旧约训诂”的课程类别中，他开设《前代希伯来先知》《后代希伯来先知》《旧约诗文》，在“旧约历史与教义”的课程类别中，开设《以色列民族史》《闪族之宗教》《先知的社会理想》等课。在语言课程中，则教授《希伯来文初阶》《希伯来文训诂》。放眼当时的学术界，能教授古代…]]></summary>

在各个群晖用户论坛里，有用户反馈使用 WDDA 监控和测试子系统的西数硬盘一旦开机时间达到三年，就会在群晖 DSM 上出现 “警告” 标记。WDDA 类似于希捷等硬盘采用的 SMART 技术。WDDA 给出的警告说：“在硬盘的整个寿命中，该硬盘已经积累了大量的开机时间。请考虑尽快更换该硬盘”。但除此之外，硬盘似乎没有明显的问题。群晖称，该警告信息来自于西数而不是群晖。这导致大量用户恐慌，并认为这是“西数试图销售更多硬盘的掠夺性策略”。受 WDDA 影响的一些产品包括 WD Red Pro、WD Red Plus 和 WD Purple。


消息来源：Ars Technica



老王点评：这种强制老化硬盘而不是根据硬盘实际状态给出警告的做法，让用户无法再信任它的产品，只能把用户逼到其它厂商那里。顺便说一句，网上有一个帖子讨论了如何禁止该警告——但可悲是，这个 Reddit 帖子所在子区在抗议活动中暂时不能访问。




英特尔演示新的芯片背面供电技术

英特尔计划在明年推出名为 RibbonFET 的新晶体管技术，以及新的供电方法 PowerVia。PowerVia 是英特尔版本的背面供电技术。今天的芯片是在正面将晶体管与供电和数据传输互连在一起，而背面供电将所有供电互连转移到芯片背面。这会产生两个影响，其一是为正面的数据互连留出了更多空间，其二是供电互连可以更大因此电阻更小。英特尔测试了由当前一代的晶体管和 PowerVia 组合的处理器内核，显示内核频率提升逾 6%，设计更紧凑，功耗降低 30%。过去几代的英特尔芯片在功耗效率上都落后于竞争对手，如 AMD 使用台积电 7 纳米和 5 纳米工艺制造的芯片。


消息来源：Solidot



老王点评：虽然经常说芯片技术要达到极限了，但是我们看到的是总是有各种突破和改进，所以我预期芯片技术还会继续以摩尔定律向前发展。




Edge 会将你在线观看的图片发送到微软

Edge 有一个内置的图像增强工具，可以使用 “超级分辨率来改善网络上图像的清晰度、锐度、照明和对比度”。虽然该功能听起来很令人兴奋，但最近的微软 Edge Canary 更新表明，它会将图像链接发送到微软，而不是在本地设备上执行增强。这个功能虽然可以关闭，但是它是默认启用的。之前，用户还发现 Edge 会将你的浏览器历史记录泄露给 Bing。


消息来源：NeoWin



老王点评：微软的骚操作挺多啊，虽然 Edge 需要更多丰富的功能来胜过 Chrome，但似乎用力过猛了。]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[6月9日，微博认证账号为“苏享茂的哥哥苏享龙”发布消息称，翟欣欣已被逮捕并羁押于某看守所。他所发《立案通知》图片显示，“翟欣欣敲诈勒索案”一案，北京市公安局海淀分局认为“符合立案条件”现“立案侦查”，通知发出时间是2023年5月19日，家属第二天签收。


苏享茂从认识女方到离婚百余天被索要千万后自杀一事，终于再次有了关键性进展。


虽然并未看到关于批捕的任何法律文书，但据相关知情人向中新社国是直通车透露，翟欣欣在本周被批准逮捕。


婚恋网站上遇到“致命爱人”！


梳理事件经过：2017年9月7日凌晨5时许，时年37岁的WePhone创始人兼开发者苏享茂从北京市某地跳楼，被发现时已无生命体征。坠楼发生之前，苏享茂在WePhone产品上推送了一条“公司法人被毒妻翟某害死，WePhone即将停止运营”的消息。两人于同年6月7日结婚、7月18日离婚。


苏享茂遗书内容显示，他与翟欣欣于婚恋网站相识，结婚前为翟欣欣花了几百万，领证前一天才被告知曾有短暂婚史，翟欣欣还通过诉讼从前夫处获得20万元分手费。苏翟俩人商议离婚后，翟欣欣以家中有官员亲戚及举报苏享茂偷漏税相要挟索要1000万元分手费及海南300万元房产。


此后，死者哥哥苏享龙发文爆出大量疑似苏享茂与翟欣欣以及翟欣欣与他人聊天记录，直指翟欣欣为了“弄钱”才与苏享茂结婚，其中还有与他人谈价约见的内容。诉翟欣欣的民事案件于2020年12月21日在北京市朝阳区人民法院开庭审理。


时隔两年多之后，该案于2023年3月31日在北京市朝阳区人民法院宣判，一审判决翟欣欣退还苏享茂家属现金、汽车共近千万以及撤销翟欣欣海南、北京两套房产的个人所有权，翟欣欣提起上诉。


民事案件尚未落定，翟欣欣便以“敲诈勒索罪”被刑事立案侦查并批捕。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[1928年担任燕京大学宗教学院院长的李荣芳

《真理与生命》杂志1929年和1930年两期，刊登了李荣芳撰写的两篇《圣地游行记》。《真理与生命》是民国期间极具影响力的基督教刊物，主编为赵紫宸，编辑部成员与“撰述员”基本来自燕京大学宗教学院。这两篇游记，记述了李荣芳于1929年3月到5月在巴勒斯坦地区的两次出游，一次是乘车，“专到紧要的区域”，一次是骑马，“专到闭塞的地方”。
李荣芳（1887-1965）是燕京大学宗教学院教授。相比于吴雷川、赵紫宸这些中国基督教界的名人，他在生前和身后都不是一个响亮的名字。但他有一个独特的背景，是其他民国基督教知识分子所不具备的。李荣芳是在美国受过科班训练的圣经学学者，而不是单纯研究神学的理论家。他于1908年进入汇文大学神科，获得学士和硕士学位。1913年，他进入位于美国新泽西州的德鲁神学院（Drew Theological Seminary，当时译为“芝儒神学院”），大约在1917或1918年获得神学博士。从他的博士导师、博士论文选题、回国后开设的课程、翻译的英文著作以及他自己所撰写的报刊文章，我们可以看到他是一位严谨的圣经学者，而不是泛谈神学义理的神学家。
李荣芳1917年归国，先在自己的母校汇文大学任教。1919年燕京大学成立，汇文大学就是组成燕大的四所教会大学之一，所以李荣芳也就成为燕京大学神学院教授（后改为“宗教学院”）。创校之初，教员中只有两位中国教师，李荣芳便是其中一位，主要教授圣经希伯来文和旧约。根据1931年燕京大学宗教学院的课程大纲，李荣芳开设多门与旧约有关的专业课。在“旧约训诂”的课程类别中，他开设《前代希伯来先知》《后代希伯来先知》《旧约诗文》，在“旧约历史与教义”的课程类别中，开设《以色列民族史》《闪族之宗教》《先知的社会理想》等课。在语言课程中，则教授《希伯来文初阶》《希伯来文训诂》。放眼当时的学术界，能教授古代…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[以下是如何从 Debian 11 升级到 Debian 12 “Bookworm” 的步骤。


Debian 12 Bookworm 已经发布。如果你正在运行 Debian 11 “Bullseye”，你可以计划现在升级你的台式机或服务器。但是，建议你等待 Debian “Bookworm” 的第一个小版本，即 12.1 版本，再进行关键服务器升级。

话虽如此，如果你想了解 Debian 12 的新特性，可以查看 这篇文章。以下是详细的升级步骤：

从 Debian 11 升级到 Debian 12

无论你运行的是 Debian 服务器还是任何桌面版本，请确保备份关键数据。例如，你可能需要为桌面文档进行备份。如果是服务器，请记录正在运行的服务。你可以使用 rsync 或其他实用工具来完成此操作。

Debian 12 引入了一个名为 non-free-firmware 的新仓库，用于专有驱动程序和软件包。如果你使用任何“闭源”的网络、显示、图形或其他驱动程序，你可能需要在升级后进行配置。

对于网络驱动程序，请确保在某个地方安全地记录 /etc/network/interfaces 和 /etc/resolv.conf 文件的内容。如果在升级完成后失去了网络连接，可以 按照这个指南 轻松设置它。

从命令提示符运行以下命令，以确保 Debian 11 更新了安全和其他软件包：

sudo apt update
sudo apt upgrade
sudo apt full-upgrade
sudo apt autoremove


完成上述命令后，重新启动 Debian 11 系统：

sudo systemctl reboot


记下关于 Debian 11 的几个信息。这对于服务器很重要。它们包括内核版本和 Debian 版本。这…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Debian 的下一个重要版本已经发布。




虽然没有固定的时间表，但每隔约两年 Debian 就会推出一个新的稳定版升级。

Debian 11 发布于 2021 年，现在是 2023 年，我们迎来了下一个主要版本 Debian 12。

要注意的是，正如发布说明中所提到的，Debian 12 发布时已知存在约 100 个错误。因此，在升级或安装之前，你可能需要详细阅读此版本的发布说明。


💡 如果你不知道，每个 Debian 的稳定版本都可以得到 至少三年的活动维护和支持，此外，它也提供了 两年的扩展 LTS 支持作为商业服务。直到 2028 年 6 月，Debian 12 都将得到支持。你有一年的时间从 Debian 11 升级。


Debian 12 有哪些新功能？

对于重大版本升级，肯定会更新一些软件包，而过时或老旧的软件会被删除。

与我们在 Debian 12 功能列表 中提到的类似，包括了以下增强功能：


更新的安装程序

Linux 内核 6.1

默认启用 PipeWire 音频系统

全新壁纸


安装程序升级



每个发行版都致力于改进新用户的安装体验，而 Debian 也不例外。

Debian 12 可以更好地处理非自由固件，这是可以提高新用户的入门体验的亮点之一。

此外，还有许多底层改进，包括硬件兼容性升级。

Linux 内核 6.1



Debian 12 带有 LTS 版本的 Linux 内核 6.1。

该内核包含 Rust 的实验性支持、AMD 硬件优化和改进的 ARM 支持。

桌面环境和软件升级

Debian 12 默认预装了 GNOME 43、KDE Plasma 5.27、LXDE 11、LXQt 1.2.0、MATE 1.26 和 XFCE 4.18。新的桌面环境版本应该会提升桌面体验，还有必要的应用程序更新，包括：


GIMP 2.10.34

Perl 5.36

Vim 9.0

OpenJDK 17




不要忘了还有一张新的 壁纸，为所有那些神奇的软件更新增添了装饰。

其他变化



如果你需要了解完整的技术细节和升级信息，可以查看 发行说明 或 官方公告。这里列出了一些重要的更新亮点：


默认启用 PipeWire 音频服务器

基于 Go 的软件包支持限制安全

删除了超过 9,519 个过时/陈旧的软件包

Debian 12 现在可以检测到双引导系统中的 Windows 11。

已经重新引入了 ARM64 上的 Secure Boot 支持。



下载 Debian 12


Debian 12 是一个不错的升级版本，但请注意 某些问题。你已经升级了吗？请让我知道你的想法。

The main goal of zsync is to foster high quality content and discussion. That's it. If it can't accomplish that, then to me it is a failure. I watched Reddit go from having high quality discussion in 2008-9 to devolving into the PC meme dumpster it is today [1]. HN still has the highest discussion quality of any "forum" I know of, but (1) it can sometimes randomly be very hostile/toxic to new tech, the most glaring example being crypto. (2) HN is basically a single subreddit mostly geared towards tech and startups. It'd be nice to have an equivalent of "subreddits"

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Heya HN, I've been working on a reddit-like platform as my primary side project for the last few years. Doing a (very) soft launch today, mainly because I want to use it to encourage discussion of alternatives.
How non.io works:
1. Free to browse, paid to interact.
2. Minimum subscription is $2 (though you can choose more). I take $1 to run the servers, everything left gets split evenly between everything you upvote that month.
It's a simple model, but I hope it's a better one than the freemium model we've been relying on for the last few years. Fundamentally I feel like any ad-supported network doesn't have alignment between the needs of the users and the needs of the platform, which is what drove me to make this.
Because this is a soft launch, if you do subscribe I'd encourage you not to pay for the time being. I'm still testing the distribution algorithm for returning funds - you won't get overcharged or anything, but I just want to guarantee your funds are properly distributed at the end of the month. I've opened up free accounts to post and interact in the meantime. If you want to try a test account, use this login:
login: hackernews pw: helloworld
Edit: Loginless browsing here: https://non.io/#all
If you want to browse the code or the api:

To give the platform a shot, anyone can sign up and use DevCycle for free here: https://devcycle.com
Here’s a general platform demo video if you’re interested: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZD-pyKGwR4
Feature flagging is a technique that lets developers switch features on or off in a software application without redeploying it, enhancing testing and rollback capabilities. At their core, feature flagging platforms solve the problem of separating production code deploys from feature releases to users. While DevCycle solves that same general pain, we also aim to solve core problems in developer experience and …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[超过 80% 的 Reddit 子区关闭

此前，我们 报道 过，Reddit 为 API 访问设定了远超合理的价格，事实上扼杀了第三方客户端，招致社区的强烈抗议，子区管理员们定于 12 日临时或永久关闭子区以抗议。现在，Reddit 社区开始计划中的大规模抗议。截止发文，Reddit 共有逾 7,266 个子区（版块），目前已有 6,292 个已经关闭了对外访问，从公开变成私有，其中包括订阅数超过四千万的 r/funny，订阅数超三千万的 r/aww、r/gaming、r/Music 等等，订阅人数合计超过 26 亿。Reddit CEO 上周五举办的问答讨论没有解决任何问题，反而更进一步激怒了 Reddit 社区，一些原计划关闭 48 小时的子区也决定无限期关闭。抗议者们还制作了 专门的网站 来统计已经关的子区，非常壮观的列表。


消息来源：Reddark



老王点评：这下好了，都关闭了，Reddit 就省钱了。




Debian 12 “Bookworm” 正式发布

在将近 2 年的开发之后，代号为 “Bookworm” 的 Debian 12 正式发布，它将得到 5 年的支持。Debian 12 使用的桌面环境包括：GNOME 43、KDE Plasma 5.27、LXDE 11 等。该版本的软件包总数达到 64,419，包含 11,089 个新的软件包，移除了 6,296 个过时的软件包，更新了 43,254 个软件包，总占用磁盘空间 365 GB，总代码行数达 13 亿行。


消息来源：Debian



老王点评：无论如何，Debian 仍然是最重要的 Linux 发行版之一，也是诸多发行版的根源。




西方更担心中国获得 AI 主导地位

风险投资家 Marc Andreessen 撰文批评了 “AI 末日论者”，称人工智能 “并不想杀死你，因为它不是活的……人工智能是一台机器 —— 它不会像你的烤面包机那样活过来。”他认为，科技公司之所以倡导建立监管壁垒，形成一个由政府保护的人工智能供应商组成的企业联盟，免受新的创业公司和开源竞争的影响，是这样他们就可以赚更多钱。另外他指出，不以最大力度和速度追求人工智能的实际风险就是中国，中国正在快速发展人工智能。为了阻止中国人工智能影响力的扩散，他认为，“美国和西方国家应该尽可能地靠拢人工智能”。


消息来源：CNBC



老王点评：人工智能这个魔盒打开后，基于博弈论的考虑，是无法关上的。]]></summary>

无论是智能手机、桌面电脑还是物联网设备，开源软件在某种形式上无处不在。

虽然安卓是一个开源项目，但你可以在上面找到专有和开源的应用程序。除了你可能已经使用的流行专有安卓应用程序，开源安卓应用程序可以作为更好的替代品，它尊重你的隐私。

在这里，我为你精选了最好的开源安卓应用程序，可以作为日常使用的应用。

希望这个列表对你分享给他人时有所帮助！


📋 列出的开源应用程序可以在谷歌 Play 商店、F-Droid 商店或开发者的官方网站/平台上找到。你应始终使用官方推荐源来下载和安装 APK。


键盘应用



当你发送短信或搜索信息时，键盘应用程序是你最常接触的应用程序。

当然，像 SwiftKey 这样的应用也许在以前还不错，但现在它们已经稍显普通了。此外，选择一个尊重你的隐私、符合预期（没有任何花哨的功能）的开源键盘应用程序才是明智的选择。一些最佳选项包括：

1、Simple Keyboard

如其名称所示，Simple Keyboard 是一个 极简的选项，适合想要没有花哨功能的简单键盘应用程序的用户。它是谷歌默认键盘应用程序 Gboard 的出色替代品。

但如果你想要主题自定义和一些额外的控件，它可能会让你失望。


📥 GitHub



📥 F-Droid



📥 Play 商店


2、AnySoftKeyboard

AnySoftKeyboard 是我的最爱，它拥有我需要的所有基本功能，包括 主题自定义、快速文本和手势支持。

如果你想要一个简单的键盘体验，它可以很简单；如果你要求更多的功能，它也可以是一个合适工具。

詹姆斯·鲍斯威尔（James Boswell）1740年生于苏格兰的爱丁堡，其父是贵族兼大法官，原本希望子承父业，但鲍斯威尔醉心于伦敦的游乐，尤好结交名士。1763年他和约翰生在伦敦初次相见，两人逐渐克服了年龄、家庭背景、性格爱好等方面的差异，成为忘年至交。他的《约翰生传》常常被誉为“现代欧洲传记的鼻祖”。
这本传记涵盖了约翰生的一生，包含大量的轶事和人物对话。鲍斯威尔自豪地说，“在这部作品中，约翰生的形象将比其他任何留在人们记忆中的，都更完整、更清晰”。传统传记刻意追求伦理意义，如中世纪的圣徒传记，往往将传主理想化、圣洁化。而鲍斯威尔开创的现代传记，其特点就是真实地再现传主的人生及其所处的时代。约翰生曾教导鲍斯威尔，传记作家的责任就是“展示日常生活中的微小细节”，不要回避传主的缺点。这本传记记录了约翰生的许多怪癖，但更突显了约翰生狂放孤傲的秉性、独立的人格以及率真的性情。二十多年来，鲍斯威尔孜孜不倦地记下有关约翰生的言谈，这本传记并非仅仅“记事”，更是大量地“记言”。《约翰生传》不乏戏剧性，转述大段的对话时，灵活自如地照顾到各位发言者的独特性格和语气，读者屡屡有亲临历史现场之感。 
值得一提的是，《约翰生传》提供了大量的历史材料，将十八世纪中后期的英国社会浓缩在其中，如果我们对当时的社会、文化背景不甚了了，恐怕很难体会鲍斯威尔的匠心。中国读者得感谢《约翰生传》的译者蒲隆先生。这个中文全译本的准确、流畅且不说，大量的注释，尤其是人物“小传”，更是读者必不可少的“辅助材料”。蒲先生翻译《约翰生传》，主要依据“人人文库”和企鹅出版社的版本（详情可以参见2023年3月24日的《上海书评》）。企鹅经典版由大卫·沃默斯利（David Womersley）编辑，拉丁语、希腊…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[不太会讲笑话的 ChatGPT

研究人员发现 ChatGPT 对笑话的了解是相当有限的：在一次测试中，输出的 1008 个笑话中有 90% 是相同的 25 个笑话。其中说了 140 次的笑话是：“为什么稻草人会获奖？因为他在自己的领域里表现突出。（双关语：站在田地里）”当被要求解释 25 个最常见的笑话中的每一个时，ChatGPT 大多提供了有效的解释，表明它 “理解” 文字游戏和双关语等风格。有趣的是，ChatGPT 喜欢拿番茄开玩笑。


消息来源：Ars Technica



老王点评：看来人工智能在这么高级的理解上还有所欠缺。不过，即便真的人工智能懂得讲各种笑话之后，距离它“拥有”情感，估计也有很漫长的距离。




英特尔开源 One Mono 编程字体

英特尔公布了 One Mono 字体，这是一种迎合 “开发者需求” 的新字体，采用 “富有表现力” 的等宽字体，以提高清晰度和可读性。它更容易阅读，而且可以免费使用，采用了开源的字体许可证。它不仅可以免费下载和使用，还可以免费编辑，并免费重新发布。


消息来源：GitHub



老王点评：嗯，又一个开源的编程字体，虽然有一些好评，但是似乎这些编程字体都差不多，那为什么大家要不断发布自己的开源字体呢？




自动驾驶的 Waymo 汽车在路上撞死了狗

报告称 Waymo 的一辆汽车在旧金山碾压了一只狗。这起事件是 Waymo 首次报告的死亡事件。从街景链接来看，这条路看起来像一个繁忙的工业区，有许多仓库、卡车送货区和铁丝网围栏。一只小狗跑到 Waymo 自动汽车前面的街道上。Waymo 自动汽车随后与该狗发生了接触，该狗没有生还。撞击发生时，Waymo 自动汽车的 4 级自动驾驶系统处于自主模式，并且有一名测试司机在场（在司机座位上）。Waymo 发表声明称，“系统正确识别了从停放的车辆后面跑出来的狗，但未能避免接触。”


消息来源：Ars Technica



老王点评：虽然这看起来是不可避免的，但是我一直觉得法律责任和保险责任是自动驾驶真正成熟的前提，甚至不是技术。]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[如果你和我一样，在 20 世纪七八十年代使用计算机长大，你可能学过一种常见的个人计算机编程语言，名为 BASIC（全称是 “初学者的通用符号指令代码Beginner's All-purpose Symbolic Instruction Code”）。那个时期，包括 TRS-80、Apple II 和 IBM PC 在内的每台个人计算机都可以找到 BASIC 实现。当时，我是一个自学的 BASIC 程序员，在尝试了 Apple II 上的 AppleSoft BASIC 后，转向 IBM PC 上的 GW-BASIC，后来在 DOS 上学习了 QuickBASIC。


我通过编写一个示例程序来探索 BASIC 和 FORTRAN 77 中的 FOR 循环，以将数字列表从 1 加到 10。


但是曾经，一种在科学编程领域受欢迎的语言是 FORTRAN（即 “公式翻译FORmula TRANslation”）。尽管在 1990 年对该语言进行的规范以后，该名称更常见的风格是 “Fortran”。

当我在 1990 年代初作为大学本科物理学生学习物理学时，我利用自己在 BASIC 上的经验学习了 FORTRAN 77。那时我意识到 BASIC 许多概念都来源于 FORTRAN。当然，FORTRAN 和 BASIC 在很多其他方面也存在差异，但我发现了解一点 BASIC 可以帮助我快速学习 FORTRAN 编程。

我想通过使用两种语言编写相同的程序，展示它们之间的一些相似之处。通过编写一个示例程序来探索 BASIC 和 FORTRAN 77 中的 FOR 循环，这个程序将把 1 到 10 之间的数字相加。

Bywater BASIC

BASIC 存在许多种不同的版本，这取决于你的计算机，但该语言总体保持不变。我喜欢的一种 BASIC 版本是 Bywater…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[在 上一篇文章 中，你学习了函数。在这篇文章中，我们将学习使用条件语句来管理 Rust 程序的控制流。

什么是条件语句？

在编写代码的时候，最常见的任务之一就是检查某些条件是否为 true 或 false。“如果温度高于 35°C，打开空调。”

通过使用 if 和 else 这样的关键字（有时候结合使用），程序员可以根据条件（例如提供的参数数量、从命令行传递的选项、文件名、错误发生等）改变程序的行为。

所以，对一个程序员来说，了解任何语言的控制流都是至关重要的，更不用说 Rust 了。

条件运算符

下表列出了所有常用的单个条件运算符：




运算符
示例
解释




>
a > b
a 大于 b


<
a < b
a 小于 b


==
a == b
a 等于 b


!=
a != b
a 不等于 b


>=
a >= b
a 大于 或 等于 b


<=
a <= b
a 小于 或 等于 b



以及下表是逻辑运算符，它们用于一个或多个条件之间：




运算符
示例
解释




|| （逻辑或）
条件1 || 条件2
条件1 或 条件2 中至少有一个为 true


&& （逻辑与）
条件1 && 条件2
所有 条件都为 true


! （逻辑非）
!条件
条件 的布尔值的相反值




📋 与数学相似，你可以使用圆括号来指定操作的优先级。


使用 if else

要控制 Rust 代码的基本流程，使用两个关键字：if 和 else。这可以根据提供的条件的状态创建两个“执行路径”。

一个简单的带有替代执行路径的 if 块的语法如下：

if 条件 {
    <语句>;

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[杰伊·温特、徐国琦（章静 绘）

耶鲁大学历史系教授杰伊·温特（Jay Winter）是第一次世界大战史研究的领军人物。他召集七十多名历史学家组成的国际团队共同编写《剑桥第一次世界大战史》，以跨国史视角和研究方法来叙述这场现代社会的浩劫，呈现了大量一手资料和最新研究成果。杰伊·温特的个人著作主要有《记忆之地，哀悼之所：欧洲文化史中的第一次世界大战》（Sites of Memory, Sites of Mourning: The Great War in European Cultural History, 1995）、《勿忘战争》（Remembering War, 2006）和《和平与自由的梦想》（Dreams of Peace and Freedom, 2006）等。以《中国与大战》《一战中的华工》等研究享誉国际的香港大学历史系教授徐国琦是《剑桥第一次世界大战史》编写团队中唯一的中国学者。他近年来提倡并身体力行“共有的历史”研究方法，跳出民族国家视野的学术范畴，着眼于跨国史及不同文明之间的交流，著有《中国人与美国人：一部共有的历史》《亚洲与一战：一部共有的历史》《奥林匹克之梦：中国与体育，1895-2008》等。
在《剑桥第一次世界大战史》中文版出版之际，《上海书评》邀请徐国琦教授与杰伊·温特教授进行了一次线上对谈，他们就历史写作中的跨国史视野，以及一战史研究近十年的新议题与新动向交换了想法。

《剑桥第一次世界大战史》（三卷），【美】杰伊·温特主编，姚百慧等译，浙江大学出版社2023年3月出版，238.00元

徐国琦：首先祝贺您主编的《剑桥第一次世界大战史》中文版面世。如果我没记错的话，法文版是十年前的2013年出版的，所以这是十周年纪念了。
杰伊·温特：这的确是第一次世界大战史研究中的特殊时刻。如你所知，这部书是一项集体成就，我们也都知道这并不太常见。在我们的职业领…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In the flatpak vs snap discussions, one thing that is rarely brought up is the actual strength of the sandboxes they use. Snap uses AppArmor for confinement (meaning that non-AppArmor distros, like Fedora, have weak confinement). Meanwhile, flatpak uses bubblewrap.
 And assume best possible conditions. Snap is running on Ubuntu where confinement is strongest, apps do not have access to X11, and does not have access to home folder.
 I haven't been able to find any serious in-depth testing on this topic comparing the two directly.

 Anybody have any ideas?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[谷歌 Bard 现在可以自己编写代码来回答问题

谷歌表示 Bard 在逻辑和推理方面越来越好。谷歌说，现在当你问 Bard 一个计算任务，如数学或字符串操作，Bard 不像其它大语言模型一样显示语言模型的输出，而是会写一个程序，并执行该程序，然后向用户显示该程序的输出作为答案。谷歌举例说，对于“请为我逆转 Lollipop 这个单词”的问题，ChatGPT 会通过语言模型给出答案 “pillopoL”，这个答案是错误的。而 Bard 会显示正确的结果，并给出计算的 Python 代码。当然，谷歌警告说，Bard 可能会对你的问题解释错误从而犯错；也有可能编写了错误的程序，就像人类编写程序一样，往往第一遍是带有错误的。


消息来源：谷歌



老王点评：这就太像人类了，居然会自己编程、自己运行。




GitHub Copilot 是一种“巧妙的软件盗版方法”

GitHub Copilot 是根据 OpenAI 的 Codex 模型建立的代码建议工具，由微软的 GitHub 进行商业化。Copilot 因其无视版权和许可证直接输出开发者公开发布的开源代码而被起诉。微软、GitHub 和 OpenAI 试图驳回此案，但只设法甩掉了一些索赔，法官保留了主要的版权和许可问题待审。2022 年 7 月，为了回应公众对 Copilot 的批评，GitHub 推出了一个用户可调整的 Copilot 过滤器，以将代码建议及其周围约 150 个字符的代码与 GitHub 上的公共代码进行检查。如果有匹配或接近匹配，该代码建议将不会显示给你。但 Copilot 优化了 AI 输出的温度设置，以尽可能多地产生许可内容的小变化，使其看起来不是完全复制的，来逃避版权和许可的侵犯。投诉称，“Copilot 是一种巧妙的软件盗版方法”。


消息来源：The Register



老王点评：到底改变多少才不算抄袭呢？或许，我觉得更公平的做法是，在输出代码时提示该代码衍生自哪种许可证的代码，因此受哪种许可证影响，如何使用取决于用户自己。但似乎这样做存在一些技术困难，因为 AI 到底是如何糅合出新的代码，对人类来说还是一个黑盒。




Reddit 封杀第三方客户端之后的社区反应

之前，我们 报道 过， Reddit 大幅调整了其 API 价格，事实上扼杀了第三方客户端。出于对此政策的极度不满，Reddit 社区将于 6 月 12 日举行大规模抗议活动，参与抗议的大部分子区将关闭 48 小时，但还有部分将无限期关闭。ArchiveTeam 团队希望赶在 12 日之前 存档 内容，他们目前已存档了 108 亿个帖子（包括帖子内容、评论和图像），还有 1.5 亿个帖子等待完成，团队表示时间来不及了，希望更多人参与帮助。此外，著名的 Reddit 第三方 iOS 客户端 Apollo 宣布将于 6 月 30 日 关闭 该客户端，并 公开 了其后端源代码以示它是合法使用 API，并遵守了 API 的速率限制。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[在失去亲人后为开源项目做贡献可能会让人感到畏惧。下面是我对如何重新加入社区的建议。


开源社区是一个奇妙的地方，在这里人们聚集在一起合作，分享知识，并建立令人惊奇的东西。我还记得 12 年前 我在 Fedora 的第一次贡献，从那时起，这就是一个奇妙的旅程。然而，生活有时会妨碍我们，导致我们从参与中抽身。COVID-19 大流行病以不同的方式影响了我们所有人，对一些人来说，这是一个巨大的损失和悲痛的时期。我在大流行期间失去了我的爱人，这是最难处理的生活事件。这也让我从 Fedora 社区休息了一段时间。对于那些因为失去亲人而不得不休息的开源社区成员来说，重新回到编码和为项目做贡献可能会让人感到畏惧。然而，通过一些思考和计划，有可能卷土重来，再次成为社区的积极成员。

首先，最重要的是照顾好自己，让自己有时间和空间去悲伤。悲伤是一种个人和独特的经历。没有正确或错误的方式去经历它。重要的是要善待自己。在你准备好之前，不要急于做事情。

当你准备好重新开始贡献，你可以做几件事来使你的复出尽可能顺利。

与其他贡献者联系

这是一个艰难的事实：没有什么东西会因为你而停止，技术正在以指数形式增长。当我最近重新加入 Fedora 的时候，我觉得世界在我身边变化得太快了。从 IRC 到 Telegram 再到 Signal 和 Matrix，从 IRC 会议 到谷歌会议，从 Pagure 到 GitLab，从邮件列表到讨论区，这个名单还在继续。如果你有一段时间没有在你的社区里活动，联系你在社区里的朋友，让他们知道你回来了，并准备再次做出贡献，这可能会有帮助。这可以帮助你与人们重新建立联系，并重新进入事情的轨道。他们可能有一些建议或机会让你参与其中。我很感谢我的 Fedora 朋友 Justin W. Flory，他无私地帮助我，确保我找到了回到社区的方法。

从小事做起

过去，我曾担任 Fedora 多样性、公平和包容（D.E.I.）顾问，这是 Fedora 理事会 成员职位之一。这是一个很大的工作。我认识到这一点，而且我知道如果我在休息后立即考虑做同样的工作，那么这将是一个负担，有可能导致 早期倦怠。放轻松是非常重要的。从小事做起。

如果你对重新投入一个大项目的想法感到不知所措，那就从小事做起。有大量的小任务和错误需要修复，解决其中的一个问题可以帮助你轻松地回到社区。

找一个导师

如果你对如何开始或将你的努力集中在哪里感到不确定，可以考虑找一个 导师。导师（就我而言，是 Justin W. Flory）可以在你复出时提供指导、建议和支持。

展示感激

开源社区是建立在许多人的贡献之上的。一个健康的社区会对你的贡献表示感谢。表达感激之情是使社区健康发展的一部分。对那些帮助你、指导你、给你反馈的人表示感谢。

封锁你的日历

最初，可能需要一些时间来恢复贡献的节奏。在你的日历中安排一些时间用于开源工作是有帮助的。它可以是每周/每两周一次，取决于你的可用性。记住，每一个贡献都很重要，这就是开源世界的魅力所在。这个技巧将帮助你养成规律的作息习惯。

向前两步，向后一步

最后，重要的是要记住，如果你需要，退一步也没关系。悲伤不是一个线性过程。你可能会发现，你在未来需要再次休息一下。重要的是，要对自己和他人诚实，了解自己的需求。利用你需要的时间来照顾自己。

按照你自己的条件返回

在经历了一段时间的悲痛之后，回到开源社区可能是一种挑战。这也是一个与你所热衷的事物重新联系的机会，并对世界产生积极影响。随着时间的推移，你会发现你能够从你离开的地方拾起，并再次重新参与到社区中。

我把我的第一篇 Opensource.com 文章献给我已故的弟弟 Nalin Sharma 先生，他在 2021 年因 COVID-19 而离开我们，年仅 32 岁。他是一个充满激情的工程师，充满了生命力。我希望他现在在一个更好的地方，我相信他将永远活在我的记忆中。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[又一次，Linus Torvalds 立场坚定地、咆哮地小小回复了某人。




Linus Torvalds 又发表了一篇热点看法（或争议？）🐧

一切都始于 Linus Torvalds 对《纽约时报》网页体验的看法。

在 social.kernel.org 上发布的一篇公开帖子中，Linus 抱怨了纽约时报网站上的广告和糟糕的用户体验。此外，他还感到烦恼的是，人们必须致电该网站团队才能取消订阅纽约时报。

下面是他的发帖：



但是，这与我们新闻标题毫不相关，是吗？😕

是有点无关，但这件事还有更多的内容。

实际上，Linus 在 他的帖子 中继续向他的一些粉丝解释，他并不介意订阅纽约时报，但是由于令人讨厌的体验，这变成了一项不可接受的条件。

在他的帖子的一条评论中，一位用户还提到纽约时报不值得关注，并将其称为“清醒的共产主义宣传”。

以下是该用户的原文：



虽然这与最初讨论的上下文无关，但 Linus Torvalds 坚定的表明了他对这种观点的信仰。



他的回复如下：


我觉得你可能不应该关注我，因为你那个“清醒的共产主义宣传”的评论让我觉得你是一个一流的白痴。我强烈怀疑我就是你担心的那些“清醒的共产主义者”之一。但你可能无法解释这两个词的任何一个真正意思，对吧？


此外，他还分享了下面这段话：


我是一名持证的无神论者，我认为妇女的选择权非常重要，我认为“有组织的民兵”意味着应该仔细发放枪支许可证，而不是随便给予任何有脉搏的白痴，我一点也不在意你决定穿“错误”的衣服或者决定不为你出生时的性别所束缚。该死的，如果这些让我成为“清醒”的人，那么我认为使用这个词作为贬义词的任何人都是人类的耻辱。所以请立刻取消关注我吧。


虽然这只是社交媒体上的一次言论碰撞，但他的回复被一些人视为有争议，有些人将他标签为“左派”（不管这是什么意思）。

当然，还有其他人认为 Linus Torvalds 正确地表达了他想要说的话，这没有什么不对的。如果你了解 Linus Torvalds，你会知道他通常直言不讳地表达自己的观点。

就像他最近对 Linux 6.3 的 一个糟糕的提交请求 感到愤怒一样。

在这里，我们不讨论具体问题。当然，我们关注的是 Linux 和开源软件……还有 Linus Torvalds 😉

但是，从回复中可以看出，Linus Torvalds 似乎不喜欢用“清醒”一词来贬低某些事物。他明显尊重其他人的选择，并且“一点也不在意”。

💬你认为 Linus Torvalds 对“清醒的共产主义”意识形态的看法怎么样？请在下方评论区分享你的想法。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[两位意义不同的“杨老师”
杨志洵，字（或号）景苏，亦作劲苏、劲素，江苏金匮（今无锡市）人，卒于1939年，生年不详。他不算是一个名人，却被文史爱好者不时提到。人们对他的兴趣和了解主要来自两组关系，以下略为分解。
其一，杨志洵在胡适的早年进学之路上发挥过关键作用，是后者终生铭感的恩师。1910年，沉沦上海的胡适受许怡荪、程乐亭等友人劝告资助，进京应考庚款留美。在北京，二哥胡觉（字绍之）的好友杨志洵“厚待”之，介绍他“住在新在建筑中的女子师范学校（后来的女师大）校舍里”；考取后南下上海，旅费也是杨志洵借他的，后由胡觉代为归还（1911年1月10日胡觉致胡适信，《胡适遗稿及秘藏书信》，黄山书社1994年版）。
这场耽搁不过月馀，胡适就录取赴美了，留下的印象却非常美好，至以“怜我无家能慰我，佳儿娇女倍情亲”的诗句来形容。两年后的圣诞节，胡适在美国受到白特生（Patterson）夫妇“有如家人骨肉”般的招待，感激之馀，想到的是：“前在都门，杨景苏夫妇亦复如是。”（1912年12月25日日记，《胡适日记全集》，联经出版公司2004年版）
除了生活上的照顾，杨氏还辅导胡适功课，给予他学术上的关键点拨：
杨先生指点我读旧书，要我从《十三经注疏》用功起。我读汉儒的经学，是从这个时候起的。（《四十自述》，亚东图书馆1939年版）

胡适《四十自述》手稿中的杨志洵

这里说得较为简略，更详细的指导过程，可从胡适当时写给许怡荪的信里窥见端倪：
昨向友人处借得《十三经注疏》读之，始知讲经非从古注入手不可。古注虽亦有大谬之处，然参考众说，可得其真意；再以朱子集注参观之，以新文法旁证之，说经之奥，尽于此矣。甚望足下先从经入手，以史辅之，一二年后根柢定矣，然后从事文艺，乃为有根据之学问。（1910年7月18日函，《胡适许怡荪通信集》，上海人民出版社2017年版）
这里的“友人”，当然就是杨志洵。现在看来，…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The current events of Reddit and Stack Exchange amplifying a thought that communities and users' contributions should be decentralized. The current structure of online communication poses a major risk.
1. There has to be a movement at both protocol and community-level to bring a Usenet like forum for general consumption. Different decetralized subgroups hosting and replicating the communities for others.
2. The model needs to be rethought to ensure that the thoughts and knowledge of communities and users belong to them.
3. These forums should encourage less anonymity and more persistent communication.
4. Trustworthy individuals should run these forums, chosen by the community. Individual groups, academia, organizations running the communities but easily redistributed across to people who want it. This was usenet.
Failure to address these issues allows mega companies to exploit data and control access against users' wishes.
Taking action is crucial to prevent unfavorable outcomes and hold ourselves accountable.

subject of a session led by VFS co-maintainer Christian Brauner at the

filesystem-track session; Brauner had three separate items he planned on
bringing up, but the discussion on the first two consumed the whole

that is needed by a higher-priority task, with the result that the wrong
task is the only one that can run.  This problem is arguably most acute in
realtime settings, but it can happen in just about any system that has
multiple tasks running.  The variety of
scheduling classes provided by the Linux kernel make handling priority
inversion a difficult problem; the latest version of the proxy
execution patch series points toward a possible solution.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Vivaldi 将伪装成 Edge 以让用户使用必应聊天

很多网站和服务会根据用户代理（UA）字符串来限制浏览器访问，比如谷歌的一些服务。Vivaldi 在 2019 年修改了 UA 冒充 Chrome 以实现更好的谷歌服务兼容性。而最近，微软的基于 GPT-4 的必应聊天也限制只能在 Edge 浏览器中使用，因此，最新版本的 Vivaldi 将能冒充 Edge 浏览器以帮助用户绕过使用限制。


消息来源：Vivaldi



老王点评：虽然说是让用户方便了，但是总感觉这种做法不够大气，像这样的功能，就不应该是浏览器官方提供的功能，而应该是第三方插件的功能。




邮件网关厂商让用户更换有漏洞的设备而不是打补丁升级

Barracuda 公司的电子邮件安全网关（ESG）负责扫描所有传入和传出的电子邮件以查找恶意软件。在收到关于来自其 ESG 设备的异常流量的报告后，该公司发现恶意流量是利用了其 ESG 设备中一个以前未知的漏洞，于是向所有受影响的设备推送了一个漏洞补丁。到这里都还是正常的剧本。令人震惊的是，该公司突然开始敦促其 ESG 客户批量废弃并更换受影响的设备，而不是打补丁。并且，该公司还说 ESG 客户还应该轮换与设备相连的任何凭证。


消息来源：Krebs on Security



老王点评：这操作委实厉害，连软件更新都无法挽救了。




iOS 17 会自动删除链接的跟踪参数

在链接中添加跟踪参数是广告商和分析公司试图跟踪用户在网站上的活动的一种方式。与其存储第三方 Cookie，不如简单地将跟踪标识符添加到页面 URL 的末端，这将规避 Safari 的标准智能跟踪预防功能。iOS 17 和 macOS Sonoma 将新增链接跟踪保护功能，在邮件、信息和 Safari 浏览器的私人浏览模式下自动激活。它可以检测到链接 URL 中可识别的用户跟踪参数，并自动将其删除。


消息来源：9to5mac



老王点评：这是完全不给广告商留路的做法啊，这里的跟踪参数估计不少是谷歌的吧。]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[采用基于开源原则的组织治理可以引导你的组织降低成本，降低技术债务，增加团队协作，促进创新，最重要的是，推动你的组织共同前进。


在我的职业生涯中，我很幸运地与许多不同规模的组织在各种项目上合作。所有这些项目的核心都是开源软件，而且大多数人都对开源社区做出了力所能及的回报。我最近在一个大型组织内从事一个使用开源软件的绿地项目。在项目的 MVP 阶段结束后，该组织的领导层很想知道是什么导致了项目的成功，以及他们如何将其应用到整个组织的其他团队中。经过思考，我发现我们团队的工作方式与开源社区和开发之间有相似之处。以下是对开源原则如何帮助组织节省资金、减少技术债务 和打破内部孤岛的一些见解。

1、更好地使用预算

我最近在佛罗里达 Drupal 营地发表了关于 无头全渠道网络平台 的演讲。演讲中强调的主要好处之一是如何通过实施这种网络平台来节省资金。这个想法来自于开源软件的开发。一个组织内的不同小组可以利用他们的预算来为一个核心软件或平台贡献特性或功能。他们还可以与其他小组合作，集中资金开发更复杂的功能。当功能开发完成后，它将被添加到核心软件或平台中，供所有人使用。使用这种开源原则可以为组织内的团体提供互利。允许共享特性和功能，并集体从彼此的支出中获益，可以改善软件或平台。

这种方法的另一个方面是可以节省开支，并允许持续改进，即对一个功能进行一次测试和开发，并重复使用它。在创建一个使用基于组件的设计系统作为起点的网络平台时，我们经常看到这种情况。该平台的用户可以重复使用其他用户开发的组件或功能。通常，这些都已经经过了无数次的测试，比如用户体验、可及性，甚至是安全测试。

这个简单的想法在许多组织中面临反对，因为个别团体觊觎和保护预算。团体不愿意放弃他们的预算来支持核心软件或平台。某些情况下，优先级和意见上的差异加剧了许多机构的孤岛化。

2、减少技术债务

许多机构努力减少技术债务。实施一个全面的核心软件或平台并使用开源原则，可以帮助减少技术债务。这可以通过允许开发团队充分考虑一个功能不仅对建立它的小组，而且对更广泛的组织有什么影响。这一点，加上与组织内其他小组的合作，可以帮助减少未来重建或增加功能的需要。

有时，由于内部竞争，组织在这种合作和思考方面会有困难。一些公司培养了一种文化，即第一个建立一个功能或提出一个想法会得到奖励。这可能会导致各小组不一起工作或分享想法，在组织内形成孤岛，大大阻碍了创新。

3、更快进入市场

我经常听到的一句话是“更快进入市场”。每个人都想更快、更容易地把他们的东西推出去。这通常是一个核心软件或平台的好处，因为内部团体可以重用现有的、经过测试和验证的特性和功能，而不是从头开始建立自己的功能。如果你的团队正在启动一个项目，而它可以从 80% 的完成度而不是 0% 的完成度开始，你会这样做吗？我想是的。现在再加上为其他用户增加所需功能的超级英雄感觉。这是一个双赢的结果！

4、发布兴奋点

另一个可以帮助你的组织的伟大的开源原则是建立兴奋的发布时间表。当你的组织实施一个核心软件或平台时，用户会对更新的时间进行投资。一个发布时间表和路线图可以向他们传达这一点。这两个工具可以帮助用户对新功能感到兴奋，并相应地规划他们自己的路线图。这也有助于建立对其他团队的欣赏，以及对建立新功能的团队的自豪感。这可以统一一个组织，让组织有团队合作和成就感，同时提供结构和未来的计划。

5、一个核心团队和管理

我发现你需要两个关键项目来克服上述障碍，并在你的组织内成功应用开源原则。这就是： 一个核心团队和坚实的组织管理。一个核心团队将允许一个小组来维护和管理你的组织的核心软件或平台。它将支持该解决方案，并确保明智地增加新的特性和功能。这个团队可以帮助减少内部团队的成本，并告知各组路线图的功能。核心团队需要得到强大的组织治理的支持。这种治理将为组织内的小组提供一个共同的方向和组织支持，以取得成功。这种组织治理可以在几个方面模仿开源的治理和原则。最基本和最高级别的原则是社区和为共同目标而工作的理念。

开放式领导

采用基于 开源原则 的组织治理可以引导你的组织降低成本，降低技术债务，增加团队协作，促进创新，最重要的是，推动你的组织共同前进。

我们生活在一个激动人心的时代。不久之前，我们都被束缚在“升级跑步机”上，被迫每隔几年购买昂贵的新电脑。

今天，借助开源软件的好处，你可以打破这种循环。其中一种方法是 翻新旧电脑，让它们继续发挥作用。本文告诉你如何实现。

1、找一台旧电脑

也许你的地下室或仓库里有一台闲置的旧电脑，为什么不利用一下呢？

或者你可以从朋友、家人或二手广告中得到一台旧机器。许多电子回收中心会让你四处翻找并带走一台你看上的被抛弃的机器。如果可以的话，务必多带回来几台，因为你可能需要从几台被弃置的电脑中获取零件来组装成一台好的电脑。

看看机器前面的贴纸，确保选择的是好的可供翻新的机器。带有 Windows 7 和 8 标志的电脑非常适合运行 Linux。对于 8.1，其扩展支持已于今年 1 月份结束，所以我看到很多这样的电脑被丢弃。

很多这些 Windows 电脑提供了完全良好的硬件。它们只是因为计划性过时而被丢弃了，因为它们不能运行 Windows 11。但是它们可以很好地运行开源软件。

2、确认并清洁所有零件

在打开你的“新”机器之前，确保通过触摸金属物品消除静电。有可能一点点的静电都会破坏精细的电路。

你需要马上查看是否缺失了零件。许多人在丢弃电脑之前会取出它们的硬盘或内存条。你要么需要获取多台机器来解决这一点，要么就需要购买一两个零件来使它完整。

在进一步操作之前，给机器做彻底的清洁非常重要。特别注意 CPU 的复杂结构、风扇和所有表面。请记住，你不能用抹布来清洁电子设备，否则会有损坏的风险，因此使用压缩空气来清洁。

3、确保所有硬件均正常工作

在安装任何软件之前，你需要验证所有硬件是否正常工作。不要省略测试！如果你在进行下一步操作之前只是短暂运行了内存测试，并在以后发现你的计算机…]]></summary>

 As you may or may not know, there's an app called Shortcat for Mac, which is amazingly cool: it allows you to navigate the "whole" UI using the keyboard (something like Vimium in the browser, but for all the "normal" windows)
 I has quite a bunch of extra features (finding emojis etc.), and it even works in Electron apps (I think they tend to be different than "normal" windows in all OSes)
 I was wondering if there's a similar app for Linux that I'm not aware.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi All, I have a fun linux admin challenge that has me sweating a bit. I have a fleet of AWS Lightsail VPS servers running basic wordpress / mysql. They're managed by the Plesk dashboard but generally Ubuntu servers. I stood them up five years ago on Ubuntu 16.04, then upgraded remotely over SSH to Ubuntu 18.04. 
 Now it's two years later and I just upgrade to 20.04. Things generally fine but I realize it has a very old network config, and some ipv6 scraps I want to fix. That means a fully remote, non-console, no boot from USB, SSH network package re-configuration. Any disconnect means a reboot or bricked box. I found the below online and thinking to script it but if it crashes then I'm restoring from a backup. 
 Any super skills or ideas for how to handle this? Alternate SSH windows won't help if I'm stopping and restarting eth0. Am I overthinking this and it just works? It's a simple auto ip4 dhcp nic config under a standard EC2 hypervisor, aws virtual nic driver
 Some suggestions found here: https://gist.github.com/mss/7a8e048dd51e5ef928039f1450ba8f31 
 apt install netplan.io
 systemctl unmask systemd-networkd.service
 systemctl unmask systemd-resolved.service
 ENABLE_TEST_COMMANDS=1 netplan migrate
 netplan try
 reboot
 apt purge ifupdown resolvconf
 ln -sf /run/systemd/resolve/stub-resolv.conf /etc/resolv.conf

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am now required to use a Linux machine as a NAS. But I am absolutely terrified. Let me explain.
 Back in 2020, I had a Windows 10 machine and a Debian 10 machine. I needed to sneakernet a file. I plugged an NTFS formatted USB Drive into Windows, copied the file, and unplugged it. Then plugged it inside the Debian machine.
 The file disappeared. I plugged it and unplugged it a few times and it still wasn't there. I plug the USB drive into Windows, and it tells me that I need to format it. Inspecting Partition Manager, I find out the USB Drive is no longer NTFS, but RAW.
 No big deal, I say. It's probably a dead USB Drive. I'll just use another one. I plugged an NTFS formatted USB Drive into Windows, copied the file, and unplugged it. Then plugged it inside the Debian machine. The file disappeared. I plugged it and unplugged it a few times and it still wasn't there. I plug the USB drive into Windows, and it tells me that I need to format it. Inspecting Partition Manager, I find out the USB Drive is no longer NTFS, but RAW.
 To figure out what was going on, I plug both USB Drives into AOMEI.
 To my sheer horror, after hours of investigating, I find out that 90% of all Linux distros will automatically, WITHOUT YOUR CONSENT, format any drive you plug in to EXT4.
 I haven't touched a Linux machine since. But now, thanks to Windows 11, I might be forced to. I have to plug in a 4TB NTFS drive, AND it's identical backup, into a Debian 12 machine, knowing that at any moment it might randomly format BOTH the main AND the backup to EXT4 and I will lose absolutely everything. How do I overcome this fear? Has this issue even been fixed?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[人工智能发现了更快的排序算法

谷歌 Deepmind 的新 AI 系统 AlphaDev 使用深度学习发现了更快的排序算法。他们采取了与国际象棋和围棋相同的方法：把代码优化变成了一种游戏。AlphaDev 开发了 x86 汇编算法，将代码的延迟视为一个分数，并试图将这个分数降到最低，同时确保代码运行到完成时没有错误。他们希望将新的算法纳入到 LLVM 的 C++ 排序库中，不过问题是，这些代码是用汇编而不是C++，因此，他们不得不反向移植，找出能够产生相同汇编的 C++ 代码。研究人员称，这是排序库算法方面十年来的首次突破。新算法对较短序列的排序速度提升了最高 70%，而对超过 25 万个元素的长序列速度提升了 1.7%。


消息来源：Ars Technica



老王点评：能优化算法的人工智能，也就是说，人类在智力方面都会被人工智能超越。




OpenAI 还没有训练 GPT-5

3 月底，诸多人工智能领域的专家和科技高管签署公开信，呼吁 “所有人工智能实验室立即暂停训练比 GPT-4 更强大的人工智能系统至少 6 个月”。OpenAI 对此回应称，它还没有开始训练 GPT-5，而且在 “一段时间内” 不打算这样做。OpenAI 说，“当我们完成 GPT-4 时，在准备好发布它之前，我们花了六个多月的时间。”


消息来源：Tech Crunch



老王点评：就目前而言，可能我们需要的不是更强大的人工智能，而是成本更低的、消除 AI 鸿沟的人工智能。




苹果推出在 Mac 上运行 Windows 游戏的工具

苹果宣布，通过一个类似于 Valve 的 Proton 的环境，可以在 macOS 上翻译和运行最新的 DirectX 12 Windows 游戏，使得将 Windows 游戏移植到 Mac 上变得更加容易和快捷。和 Proton 一样，它是基于 CrossOver 的代码的。


消息来源：The Verge



老王点评：说到底，大家都在 Windows 上玩游戏，连 Mac 也开始眼馋这一块了。]]></summary>

Lua 是一种有时会被误解的语言。它与 Python 等其他语言不同，但它是一种通用的扩展语言，广泛用于游戏引擎、框架等。总的来说，我发现 Lua 对开发人员来说是一个有价值的工具，可以让他们以一些强大的方式增强和扩展他们的项目。

你可以按照 Seth Kenlon 的文章《Lua 值得学习吗？》的介绍下载并运行常用的 Lua，该文章中还包括了简单的 Lua 代码示例。但是，要充分利用 Lua，最好将它与采用该语言的框架一起使用。在本教程中，我演示了如何使用名为 Mako Server 的框架，该框架旨在使 Lua 程序员能够轻松地编写 IoT 和 Web 应用代码。我还向你展示了如何使用 API 扩展此框架以使用树莓派的 GPIO 引脚。

要求

在学习本教程之前，你需要一个可以登录的正在运行的树莓派。虽然我将在本教程中编译 C 代码，但你不需要任何 C 代码经验。但是，你需要一些使用 POSIX 终端的经验。

安装

首先，在树莓派上打开一个终端窗口并安装以下工具，以使用 Git 下载代码和编译 C 代码：

$ sudo apt install git unzip gcc make


接下来，通过运行以下命令编译开源 Mako Server 代码和 lua-periphery 库（树莓派的 GPIO 库）：

$ wget -O Mako-Server-Build.sh \
  https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RealTimeLogic/BAS/main/RaspberryPiBuild.sh


查看脚本以了解它的作用，并在你觉得没问题后运行它：

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[GNOME 的新图像查看器？看起来不错！




GNOME 的人们一直在忙碌着！

最近，你可能听说他们正在 考虑 把终端应用带回来替代那个新的控制台应用，还有 新的相机应用 将在不久的将来替换 “茄子Cheese” 应用。

你可能没注意到我们在这些核心 GNOME 应用更改中未涵盖的其他内容。

一个名为 “Loupe” 的 GNOME 新图像查看器应用，已被 GNOME 的 孵化器 接受。

请允许我带你了解一下。


💡 “孵化器”分组包含的项目属于 GNOME 核心和 GNOME 开发工具的一部分，这代表着 可能有一天它们会进入 GNOME 的发布版本。


🆕 Loupe 是什么？



因此，正如我所说，这是一款适用于 GNOME 的新图像查看器应用，它 用内存安全的 Rust 编程语言编写，并提供一些很酷的功能。

例如，屏幕上的按钮可以切换各种照片、放大/缩小、进入全屏模式等等。

然后是元数据查看器，它已很好地集成到界面中，显示 位置、大小、分辨率、创建日期 等数据。



不止如此，Loupe 还支持键盘和触控板快捷键！你自己看。



这些键盘/触控板快捷方式和手势对笔记本电脑用户来说应该很方便。

这对于触摸屏来说很好 🤗

另外，我怎么能忘记可以分别从功能区菜单和标题访问的 复制到剪贴板、移动到垃圾箱和 打印图像 选项？

这是实际操作：




很整洁，不是吗？

我必须说，Loupe 有一套漂亮的功能，我发现自己每天在浏览照片时都在使用它。

它旨在取代现有的 Eye of GNOME（eog）图片查看器，当然，除非有任何问题，否则可能会随着 GNOME 45 的发布而出现。

📥 获取 Loupe

你可以从 Flathub 商店 获取 Loupe，还可以在 GitLab 上探索其源代码。


Loupe（Flathub）


💬 你怎么看？ 作为 GNOME 上的默认图像查看器，Loupe 会是一个不错的选择吗？

彼得·盖伊（Peter Gay， 1923-2015）的《现实主义的报复：历史学家读〈荒凉山庄〉〈包法利夫人〉〈布登勃洛克一家〉》（原书名Savage Reprisals: Bleak House， Madame Bovary， Buddenbrooks，2002；刘森尧译，北京联合出版公司，2023年3月） 在多年前就有过同一译者的中译本《历史学家的三堂小说课》（北京大学出版社，2006年）。新译本的文字略有修订，插图从旧译本的十幅减为三幅，最重要的变化是书名改了。原著书名“Savage Reprisals”意为“野蛮的报复”，作者指的是十九世纪那些感受到社会不公与压迫的现实主义作家在小说中对社会的报复。旧译本的书名则完全另起炉灶，让读者真的以为就是听一位历史学家在课堂上谈小说。新译本把“报复”恢复并凸显出来，这是非常重要的修正，至于以“现实主义”取代“野蛮”，对于读者来说也有必要。对于早已熟悉现实主义文艺ABC的读者来说，今天的“现实主义的报复”似乎有新的双重意义：一是在文学理论中重新重视被淡化的文学对现实世界的“报复”，二是在今天的文艺与现实语境中分辨和研究现实主义文艺中的“报复”类型，研究其如何积聚愤怒与实施“报复”。十几年前我就读过这“三堂小说课”，但直到今天才真正进入那个被现实主义“报复”的历史与现实的阅读语境之中，重新思考现实主义的“报复”动机和“野蛮的”力量如何书写新的文学史与社会史。
该书的论述主题和内容并不复杂，盖伊运用了文学批评与历史研究和心理学分析相结合的方法，详细解读了三部伟大的现实主义小说：狄更斯《荒凉山庄》、福楼拜《包法利夫人》和托马斯·曼的《布登勃洛克一家》，指出这…]]></summary>

一、生存压力与社会秩序
在中国第一历史档案馆，笔者曾发现一份奏折，是清代四川重庆镇总兵张士庆向乾隆皇帝奏请关于该如何处理那些千里迢迢跑到该地卖娼的流民。张士庆被此事困扰许久：卖娼这种行为终究有伤风化，若不严加管理，定会严重影响社会秩序，然而多数卖娼妇女确属生活所迫，不得已而为之，到底该如何处理这一恼人的难题呢？我们不妨先来看看这位总兵是如何向皇帝上奏此事的：
查川省茂州汶川保县等处在万山之中，地土贫瘠，米粮稀少，每年九、十月间多有蛮民携妻来重，于城外河坝空地打棚盖茅棚佣工觅食，约计百余户或至二百余户不等，至春暖方归。内有一等无耻奸蛮，于彼典雇妻女，混杂居住处卖娼作活，岁以为常相……查茂汶至重庆往返程途不下四千里，穷蛮远涉，资釜艰难。若果听其远来又将其驱逐，不如与本地方先行查禁，免令长途往回……受人典雇之妇固非善类，其他妇女虽非俱系典雇而来，但千里长途男女混杂，难保其尽守妇道，俱属善良。且奸蛮携妇女外出，绝不会自露出典雇妻之情，而所在盘查之处亦恐不能逐户查出竟无一二遗漏。查此等不良妇女大概俱属年少之人，以后是否可除年至四十以上蛮妇仍听携带出外佣工往来居住不禁外，其年少妇女悉行禁止，不许仍携远出，则不良少妇既难混远行，而奸蛮雇妇为娼之处将不禁而自熄（息）。（《四川重庆镇总兵张士庆奏为严查奸蛮典雇妇女为娼事》，第一历史档案馆，档号：04-01-01-0010-034）
在这位总兵看来，与其发现后再驱逐那些卖娼妇女，倒不如直接让她们原籍所在地的官员严加管理，法律禁止四十岁以下妇女私自到外佣工，严格限制这些年轻妇女自由迁徙，卖娼就会自动消失，社会秩序自然恢复。对这些年轻妇女的迁徙进行严格规制，卖娼就会被根除吗？奏折所叙述的现象是十八世纪中国社会的个案吗？…]]></summary>

 I developed this indicator as a user-friendly GNOME Shell extension, which can be easily installed. If you're interested, you can find it on GitHub at https://github.com/illtellyoulater/ufw-status-indicator. The repository includes screenshots and simple installation instructions.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Steam Deck is running SteamOS, a Linux distro based on Arch. And with a few button combinations you can access a recovery menu that can boot you up into the GRUB menu, and from GRUB you can edit the boot options to enter into single user mode and perform maintenance just like a regular Linux distro would.
 With this trick I created a process to easily reset forgotten sudo password on the Steam Deck!
 I like this trick as its pretty straightforward no need to use SteamOS recovery image.

 like I said in the title this is a very simple program I wrote in Rust for fun. I'm not a programmer, I know the way I've done this is a bit janky. it's meant to be more like a weird novelty and not for any practical use. I put 31 normal recipes and some cooking with marijuana + there's jokes and conspiracy theories. if you are familiar with Some Ordinary Gamers dank web browsing there's some things you might recognize from his videos in this.
 the terminal emulator I'm using in the above screenshot is cool retro term, you can use any emulator.

the debate around the composefs read-only,

Alexander Larsson led a session on composefs.  While the mailing-list

谷歌去年以“整个生态系统没有足够的兴趣来继续试验 JPEG XL”的 理由，废弃了在 Chromium 中支持 JPEG XL 图像格式的支持。此举引来了社区的强烈反对，但谷歌置之不理。而在苹果新发布的 Safari 17 测试版中，它支持了 JPEG XL，这让更多人呼吁谷歌重新审视其决定。当然，我们有理由怀疑谷歌做出这种决定的原因，因为用户将得到的谷歌自己控制的、受专利保护的 AVIF 格式，而 JPEG XL 不受专利的约束，也不需要专利软件。

老王点评：真是风水轮流转，原本看起来封闭的苹果却在这件事上打脸了谷歌。




CNET 修订其人工智能政策并更新过去的文章

在科技媒体 CNET 悄悄开始用生成性人工智能制作文章的 消息 传出几个月后，他们修订了其人工智能政策。CNET 将不会完全使用人工智能工具来写文章，产品的实际审查和测试将由人类完成，而是用人工智能工具来分类和分析数据，为文章创建大纲，分析现有文本，并生成解释性内容。此外，CNET 更新了之前发表的几十篇使用人工智能系统生成的文章，其中一些文章包含事实错误，而另一些替换了其中“不完全是原创的短语”。


消息来源：The Verge



老王点评：就目前而言，完全用人工智能来写报道和文章，显然是不合适的，但是用人工智能来帮助写文章，显然是一件有利于提高工作效率和质量的好事。




利用人工智能生成动漫二维码

有人发布了一系列使用稳定扩散 AI 图像合成模型创建的艺术二维码，这些二维码仍然可以被智能手机的相机应用程序作为功能性二维码来读取。创作者没有详细说明用于创建新奇代码的具体技术，但他们似乎训练了几个定制的稳定扩散 ControlNet 模型（加上 LoRA 微调），这些模型已经被调整成可以创建不同风格的结果。


消息来源：Ars Technica



老王点评：这应该是一位国内的开发者的工作，这种应用确实很有趣。]]></summary>

 The way you use it is you just describe what you want to do, like this: 
  cmdh 'Show system info.' cmdh 'Display CPU speed.' cmdh 'Monitor GPU temperature' cmdh 'Continously monitor all in-use socket connections.' 
 Then the command is displayed and you can run it like so:
 ``` gibler@gibler-MS-7D43:~$ cmdh 'Show available disk space' ✔ Retrieving command... Show available disk space desire command: df -h assistant message: To show available disk space, you can run the command "df -h". This will display the disk space usage in a human-readable format. ? Choose an option:
  
Run desire command (D) Quit (Q) ```
  
Pretty easy for a Linux newbie like me
 I've made it available publicly for anyone else who would like to use it. I personally have been using it every couple days when a random task comes up that I don't know how to do from the terminal so I'm sure others can get value out of it as well. You'll need to setup your OpenAI API key on the project. It gpt-4 by default so you may have to change that to gpt-3.5.

壮游的概念可以追溯到十六世纪中叶甚至更早，“Grand Tour”一词源于法语“le grand tour”，意思是“长时间的周游”。1561 年，伊丽莎白女王曾写信给佛罗伦萨大公科西摩·德·美第奇（Cosimo de’ Medici），希望他为横贯意大利旅行的赫德福德伯爵提供安全通行证。女王对伯爵“去发现众生及其城市习俗的伟大而值得称赞的想法”大加赞赏，并对其前往海外旅行的可贵决心加以鼓励。可见，伊丽莎白女王深知大陆旅行对年轻人和整个国家的益处，她还从大学中挑选出许多有才华的青年绅士，让他们为了公共利益到海外旅行，使之成为国家之栋梁。
1670 年，理查德·拉塞尔斯（Richard Lassels）出版了《意大利之旅》（The Voyage of Italy），书中首次使用了“le grand tour”这一术语，指英国人在法国、意大利和欧洲其他地区的旅行游学，随后该术语在英国成为普遍的概念。年轻的贵族子弟在国外游历两三年，接触古典文化，学习语言，增长见识，已经成为统治阶层精英教育必不可少的内容。同时，壮游活动很快就从英国扩展到欧洲北方其他国家，成批的青年贵族在私人教师与导游的陪同下经由法国来到意大利。
“经历了拿破仑时代的狂飙突进，当和平猝然降临、囚笼般的英伦岛国大门打开之际，每个向往漫游的英国人的最高愿望就是效仿几乎被遗忘的祖先们的习俗，将相当一部分的人生和金钱花费在马车中，穿梭于欧洲大陆和邮路之间。”在十八世纪这个旅行的黄金时代，女性也加入了壮游的行列。《壮游中的女性旅行者》以壮游中的女性旅行者为主角，讲述了1757至1854年间十六位杰出女性的旅行故事。这些女性旅行者中有走在时代思想前列的女权觉醒者，如海丝特·皮奥…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[本文将介绍几个漂亮的 Arch Linux 发行版，这些发行版将设计的优雅之美与 Arch Linux 强大的底层框架相结合。


Arch Linux 提供滚动更新模型、强大的 pacman 软件包管理器，以及通过其软件仓库提供的成千上万的应用程序。它非常受欢迎，因为它允许你以 DIY 的方式创建定制的 Linux 发行版。它的优点之一是各种社区驱动的发行版，它们提供了预配置的设置和视觉上令人愉悦的界面。

本文将介绍其中一些，这些发行版的主要着眼点是它们的外观设计。

美观的 Arch Linux 发行版

让我们探索一些顶级美观的 Arch Linux 发行版，它们将美学与 Arch Linux 的核心功能相结合：

XeroLinux

XeroLinux 提供了一个视觉上惊艳的界面和流畅的设计。它预配置了 KDE Plasma 桌面环境，提供了一个整洁的工作区。这个发行版基于 Arch Linux，主要面向那些喜欢带有最新软件包和 KDE Plasma 的视觉效果的桌面环境，但又不想重新配置 Plasma 桌面环境的用户。XeroLinux 主要使用预配置的 Latte Dock 和 Kvantum 来为桌面环境带来独特的外观。



默认情况下，它使用 Catppuccin 主题，这是一个开源主题，旨在成为高对比度和低对比度主题之间的中间地带。Catppuccin 主题为 KDE Plasma 桌面环境提供了四种舒缓的温暖调色板，适用于各种用途，例如编码、休闲浏览或学习。

Plasma 桌面环境使用以下默认组件进行配置：


应用程序样式：Lightly

Plasma 样式：Scratchy

图标：Tela circle drakula dark

光标：Catppuccin mocha dark

窗口装饰：Lightly…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[这个开源工具可以轻松将 Markdown 转换为网页。


将 Markdown 文件直接变成网页，还无需搭建网站和生成过程，写完文档即可直接发布，你对这个内容感兴趣吗？你是否希望将 Markdown 或 HTML 自由地嵌入到多个平台（如内容管理系统或学习管理系统）中？由 Docsify.js 构建的开源项目 Docsify-This 提供了一种简单的方法来发布、分享和复用 Markdown 文件内容。

Docsify-This 是什么？

使用 Docsify-This，你可以立即将任何 Markdown 文件转换为响应式的独立网页。你还可以将多个 Markdown 文件链接起来，以创建一个简单的网站。网页设计师可以简单地通过点击 Web 页面生成器界面或改变网页的地址参数（即 URL），来更改所显示页面的视觉外观。在创建自己的 Markdown 文件内容时，你还可以使用一组提供的 Markdown CSS 类。此外，如果你使用 Codeberg 或 GitHub 仓库存储 Markdown 文件的话，每个页面都会自动提供一个 “编辑此页面Edit this Page” 的链接，以支持协同创作。

并且 Docsify-This 是开源的，因此你可以使用自定义域名托管 Docsify-This 实例，而不会有被平台锁定的风险。

使用 Docsify-This 网页生成器

要使用网页生成器，请先打开浏览器，导航到 Docsify-This 网站 或你在本地的实例。在 “网页生成器Web Page Builder” 部分，输入 Codeberg 或 GitHub 上公共存储仓库中的一个 Markdown 文件的 URL（其他 Git 主机可以通过 Docsify-This URL 参数进行使用，但不能在网页生成器中使用），然后点击 “发布为独立网页Pub…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey HN! We're building Seam (https://www.seam.co), a universal API for controlling IoT devices such as smart locks, thermostats, sensors, and (soon) cameras. Our hope is to make device integration simple, with a Plaid-like UI flow for obtaining device authorization and standardized API/SDKs for device control.
We started Seam out of our frustration with the challenges of integrating IoT devices with software apps.
For example, my co-founder Dawn led Sonder's efforts to integrate smartlocks with their reservation systems in order to automate access for guests. She struggled with poorly documented and unreliable device APIs along the way. Our founding engineer Max authored the popular TuyAPI library and has spent countless hours trying to build sensible interfaces on top of unreliable device…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[美国发射了一颗供黑客们攻击的卫星

周日，美国政府资助的一颗名为 Moonlighter 的卫星搭乘 SpaceX 的火箭发射成功。接下来，在大约两个月内，五支 DEF CON 黑客团队将尽力在卫星处于太空时成功地远程渗透并劫持它，其目的是在实际的在轨硬件和软件上尝试进攻和防御技术和方法。Moonlighter 被称为 “世界上第一个也是唯一一个太空黑客沙盒”，它是一个中型的 3U 立方体卫星，质量约为 5 公斤。对 Moonlighter 的第一次测试将于 8 月进行，第一名将获得 5 万美元奖金。


消息来源：The Register



老王点评：看来美国是真准备打太空战了。不过太空上有那么多目标，未必需要就在这个沙盒里面练手。




Stack Overflow 允许 AI 生成的内容，版主们罢工抗议

编程问答社区 Stack Overflow 在去年 12 月宣布了 临时禁止 ChatGPT 生成的内容。但上个月底它调整了AI 政策，“立即停止对人工智能生成的内容发布的暂停令，并停止仅以此为由对人工智能生成的内容进行审核”。此举招致了负责审核的版主们的抗议，他们认为人工智能会生成不精确的内容，这会对平台及其内容的完整性和可信度构成威胁。版主们宣布从 6 月 5 日起在 Stack Overflow 无限期罢工，目前已经约有 10% 的版主参与到这一行动中来。Stack Overflow 社区副总裁表示，这次行动的主要原因是版主们和 Stack Overflow 对检测人工智能生成的内容的工具的看法不同，他说 “我们坚持我们的决定，请版主们停止使用以前的工具”。Stack Overflow 和版主们都承认，该工具的误报率惊人。


消息来源：VICE



老王点评：本质上，你是无法防范人工智能生成的内容的，尤其是有一个不靠谱的检测工具的时候，更容易把事情搞得一团糟。与其这样，不如将分辨是否是人工智能生成的内容的精力放在认真审核上。




苹果发布其头戴式设备 Vision Pro

苹果宣布了它的第一款增强现实/混合显示头戴式设备 Vision Pro，起售价为 $3,499 美元，明年初将在美国开售。在发布后，由于其高昂的价格，苹果股价一度大幅跳水。苹果将 Vision Pro 称为“空间计算设备”，其操作系统是 visionOS，搭载全新的 3D 界面、全新的输入系统，可通过眼睛、双手和语音控制。Vision Pro 带有两个邮票大小的显示器，配置了 M2 芯片，有 12 个相机、5 个传感器和 6 个麦克风。当有人靠近正配戴 Vision Pro 的使用者时，设备的视区会变透明，双方可以互相看到，对方可以看到佩戴者的眼睛。


消息来源：苹果



老王点评：除了贵是最大的毛病外，我觉得苹果这个头戴式设备看起来似乎不错。]]></summary>

🧑🏻🏭 线上有直播，为什么我推荐你来线下参加？

三年疫情，大家似乎已经习惯了远程办公，习惯了线上沟通，淡忘了线下活动的感受。

全神贯注地听分享吧！当你习惯性预约直播之后，真的会去收看吗？当你坐在屏幕前听分享时，能保证不被周围的环境影响，全神贯注么？

和专家面对面交流吧！公开的分享会因为这样或那样的原因，隐藏一些不便提及的信息。而面对面的私下交流，往往能让人敞开心扉。

结识更多同行朋友吧！“千里难寻是朋友，朋友多了路好走”，在职场上朋友多了工作也发展更好。对于开发者，不管是结识同技术方向的朋友，还是创业、投资的朋友，都有助于长期的发展。

感受一下热闹现场吧！在规整的办公室格子里，感受不到“异界”的活力，在稀土开发者大会的现场，有各种好玩的展位和互动游戏，还有 3 只可爱的掘金 IP 在等你来！

最后，说一句肺腑之言：越是行情不好，越是要多出来走走。低头走路久了，也要抬头看看路！

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[压力测试 CPU 是检查处理器在重负载下性能表现以及系统在此情况下的温度的最佳方法之一。


当你压力测试 CPU 时，可以监视系统资源，观察它们在最高工作负载下的表现。虽然性能不会改变，但如果处理器不具备良好散热能力，温度可能会影响其运作。

对于发烧友来说，压力测试是建造新系统时必不可少的，特别是如果你打算以后超频 CPU。

例如，在压力测试过程中，如果你的 CPU 很快变得太热，你需要通过更换 CPU 风扇、使用更好的通风机箱等方式来改进散热解决方案。

现在你已经了解到压力测试的好处，接下来我将为你介绍在 Linux 中压力测试 CPU 的以下两种方法：


使用 GtkStressTesting（图形界面方式）

使用 stress 和 s-tui 实用程序（命令行方式）


接下来，让我们从第一种方法开始。

使用图形界面方法压力测试 Linux CPU 🖥️

如果你更喜欢使用图形界面方法，而不是通过终端操作，我有一个最简单的方法来帮助你进行系统压力测试。

有一个名为 GtkStressTesting 的图形界面实用工具，可以帮助你进行压力测试和同时监视温度。它提供了多种预设来进行系统压力测试，并提供了选择在测试期间需要使用多少个内核的功能。


🚧 该工具在 GitLab 上已不再积极维护。但是它仍能按预期工作。


GtkStressTesting 可以作为 Flatpak 安装，因此如果你尚未启用 Flatpak 支持，请参考我们的 Flatpak 安装指南。

一旦你启用了 Flatpak 支持，可以通过终端（如果没有软件中心）使用以下命令来安装 GtkStressTesting 实用工具：

flatpak install flathub com.leinardi.gst


安装完成后，你可以从系统…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[《编结茅香：来自印第安文明的古老智慧与植物的启迪》，[美]罗宾·沃尔·基默尔著，侯畅译 ，商务印书馆2023年1月出版，516页，88.00元

应该怎样评价美国学者罗宾·沃尔·基默尔（Robin Wall Kimmerer）的非虚构著作《编结茅香：来自印第安文明的古老智慧与植物的启迪》（Braiding Sweetgrass: Indigenous Wisdom, Scientific Knowledge, and the Teachings of Plants）呢？这当然能够算是一部科普读物。作者在书中写下了她与植物打交道的经历，还从科学的角度介绍了植物和植物学的历史。而书名里提到的“茅香”，是一种分布在亚欧大陆北部与北美洲的禾本科植物，有着一种特殊的香气。整本书以茅香为题，分为五个部分，从种植“茅香”开始，随后依次是“照料”“采摘”“编织”和“焚烧茅香”。
除此之外，书中描述的植物还包括南瓜黄花、山核桃（碧根果）乃至藻类。在一次清理老旧农场的池塘时，作者告诉读者，“这滴水看上去就像是罐子里的浮渣一样，而它却包含了这么多的生命”。在显微镜下，刚毛藻的长丝像缎带一样闪着光，而团藻则像闪着虹彩的风滚草一样。这些藻类存在的意义，就是成为食物链上的一环。只不过，对意图为自己的女儿们收拾出一个“可以游泳的池塘”的作者来说，这并不是什么好事。因为“最适合游泳的湖泊不是富营养化的，而是冰冷、清澈、贫营养的，也就是说水里没有什么营养物质”。
不过，仅凭这些，倒也很难想象这本书曾经斩获纽约时报畅销书、华盛顿邮报畅销书和洛杉矶时报畅销书排行榜的畅销书奖项。实际上，作者在书中描述了许多个人经历。譬如，在1975年进入大学学习植物学的一开始，“我的第一门专业课堪称一场灾难……我实在提不起热情来背诵植物必需营养元素的浓度”。但是到了后来，“没有人提到过紫苑和一枝黄花的伙伴关系，但我可以像背诗一样…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[咖啡跟侦探推理小说真是再适配不过了。特别是欧美和日本的作品里，咖啡无处不在，侦探，警察，嫌疑人，被害人，谁都得来上一杯。加奶油的，带着厚重感；纯黑的，则像罪案一样带点邪气，如彼时流行的俗谚：“黑得像地狱，浓得像死亡，甜蜜如爱情。”读者自然不能免俗：咖啡馆里就着一杯卡布奇诺，读一本阿加莎的《无人生还》，此乃现代“打工人”美好的“小确幸”是也。

但您可能没想过：这侦探文学的标配饮料，还跟启蒙主义思潮关系密切。
咖啡文化虽然发源于非洲、盛行于阿拉伯，却是在十七世纪的欧洲，如意大利、英国和法国真正推广起来，并迅速影响了这些国家的文化生态。在此之前，欧洲人的主要消闲处是酒馆，环境阴暗，酒醉人迷，很难引发什么理性思考；而咖啡令人清醒、专注，咖啡馆温暖、明亮、平价，对理性的逻辑思维展开有所助益，是十七世纪以后的欧洲人最喜欢的公共社交空间。
正是咖啡馆这类新型公共空间的产生，为人类进入现代民主时代提供了舞台。它的廉价——点上一杯便宜咖啡，可以坐上一整天——打破了原有的阶级隔阂，让贵族和平民可以平等交谈、辩论；在邮局、证券交易所、报社等现代设施普及之前，它还兼任所有这些场所集散信息的功能。十八十九世纪的大革命得以酝酿，与咖啡文化也不无关系——马克思和恩格斯就常常相约于摄政咖啡馆。

如果说，咖啡馆是资本主义现代城市的理性文化地标，那么，咖啡馆里的侦探推理小说，则串连了启蒙主义思潮悄然影响大众的历史链条。
等一等，咖啡也就算了，侦探推理小说怎么也和启蒙主义思潮攀上关系了呢？
侦探推理小说的核心，在于“谜题-解答结构”。此结构的奥秘，除了万事一定要有答案之外，还有中间那道杠，即：谜团是怎么解开的？要靠逻辑推理。而逻辑推理的思维前提是什么？是理性。理性意味着思维的相续展开，在事物之间发现或建立因果联系。
看上去没什么特别？我们逆推一下：用理性…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Right now I am using a traditional distro with core, community and third party packages. I am increasingly more and more interested in immutable distros. I tried NixOS in past and I have switched back to a traditional distro because I did not have time to learn about the new operative model and because NixOS was on the verge of switching to flakes, a different framework for building and installing packages.
 As a Emacs user, I am also interested in Guix, because it is a Lisp variant, but I have not tried it yet. I have only briefly dabbled in Fedora Silverblue one or two years ago, but I dropped it because it was difficult to install interception tools, for remapping keyboard keys.
 Long story short, I have tried some of the immutable systems and I get it that having a rollback is a great feature.
 What I do not understand is the discourse of enhanced security.
 For starters, it is true that every package installed as a root has root access to your machine. But I do not see how installing flatpaks solves that security issue. While I appreciate that in an immutable system you get a read only /usr partition, shouldn't the focus be on protecting the /home instead? The security issue is about the data, so if we make the /usr readable but still install third party software with normal user privileges, how did we protect our data and our privacy?
 I mean, what added security does the immutable system brings to the table if I still have to trust the flatpak provider?
 Don't get me wrong, it is great to have this separation between the apps and the core system, but I do not get the whole security discourse.
 It seems to me that we have just placed our trust elsewhere, from third party repo packagers, to flatpak packagers. But the issue of the security is still unsolved.
 Please help me to understand. Am I missing a piece of the puzzle in the whole picture?

It's one of those features that you take for granted when you come from an OS like windows and that doesn't even cross your mind until you actually have to use it.

We automate infrastructure, security, integrations, and more, helping developers ship faster while also automating a lot of repetitive tasks for devops and platform teams. Here’s a demo: https://www.loom.com/share/95265177704346c7b379e981978cd8c5.
It's expensive, time-consuming, and technically difficult to build a secure, scalable Kubernetes platform. Yet many companies that do this spend 6+ months building it themselves and then hire an expensive platform team to manage it. We've talked to customers who have spent $1.5M to build something that isn't their core product.

 After using Linux for 30 years, a few of which I worked as a SuSE Certified Linux trainer, I know how important system administration skills are for software developers and sysadmins alike. That's why I'm starting my new teaching curriculum with a Linux course.
 End of this month, I'm going to start the Linux Administration Master Course, free of charge and live on the internet. Many people have already signed up, and I would love to see many more do so. Come and join a great bunch of folk!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[AMD 霄龙 Rome 芯片会在连续运行 1044 天后崩溃

霄龙 Rome 是基于 Zen 2 架构的第二代霄龙处理器，AMD 称，它会在连续运行 1044 天后挂起，之后你必须重置服务器才能使芯片正常运行。该芯片是 2018 年底发布的，这意味着一些客户已经遇到了问题。这个问题与处理器核心未能退出 CC6 睡眠状态有关，但 AMD 表示它无意修复该错误。解决该问题有两种，其一是在连续运行 1044 天前重启下，其二是禁用 CC6 睡眠状态。


消息来源：Tom's Hardware



老王点评：连续运行三年很长么？这对于那些比赛 uptime 时长的人来说真不是一个好消息。




AWS 正在关闭其在 GitHub 上的文档仓库

2018 年，AWS 将其文档开源发布到了 GitHub 上，但经过长时间的实验，他们决定归档其大部分文档的存储库，并把精力投入到其文档和网站上。他们原本是意图通过开放和协作来提高价值，但通过客户的反馈了解到，情况并不一定如此。大部分 AWS 文档的主要来源是在内部系统上，他们必须得手动与 GitHub 仓库保持同步，但“实际上消耗了宝贵的时间，这些时间本可以用在更直接提高文档质量的地方”。


消息来源：AWS



老王点评：同步麻烦只是原因之一，重要的是，只是一厢情愿的将文档放到 GitHub 上，希望社区来协作，可能未必有最初想象的那么美好。




一个打字错误导致了 Azure 停止服务十小时

微软 Azure DevOps 是一套应用生命周期服务，由于一个基本的代码错误，周三在巴西南部地区停止工作了大约十个小时。Azure 说明了中断的原因：一个简单的打字错误，删除了 17 个生产数据库。工程师们进行了一次代码升级，将旧的 API 调用换成了新的 API 调用。在拉取请求中出现了一个打字错误，它导致后台快照删除工作删除了整个服务器。虽然 Azure DevOps 有测试来捕捉此类问题，但错误的代码只在某些条件下运行，因此在现有的测试中没有很好地覆盖。


消息来源：The Register



老王点评：越来越集中的云服务，一旦出现一个微小的故障，可能带来的就是成片的故障蔓延。


回音


在 Reddit 通过对 API 收费来 扼杀 第三方客户端后，Reddit 上的一些版块计划将在 6 月 12-14 号临时关闭版块抗议，Reddit 对此的 回应 是封杀这些版块的管理员账号。]]></summary>

人们希望在互联网上像在现实生活中一样轻松地进行交流，并享有类似的保护，但可能具有更广泛的影响力。换句话说，人们希望能够与不在同一地理位置的一群人聊天，并仍然对谁拥有对话内容进行一定程度的控制。在当今世界，很多公司对你通过互联网发送和接收的数据拥有很多权利。大多数公司似乎认为他们有权管理你的通讯方式、你的信息覆盖范围等等。幸运的是，开源并不需要拥有你的社交生活，因此开源社交网络的开发者正在推出一款首先属于你的社交网络。

“Fediverse”（“联邦”和“宇宙”合成的词，译为“联邦宇宙”）是一组协议、服务器和用户，这些组成了可以相互通信的网络。用户可以通过这些网络交换短消息、博客文章、音乐和视频。你发布的内容是联邦式的，这意味着一旦一个网络知道了你的内容，它就可以将该内容传递给另一个网络，然后再传递给另一个网络，以此类推。

大多数平台由单个公司或组织运行，是一个唯一的数据封闭系统。与其他人分享内容的唯一方法是要求他们加入该服务。

联邦允许不同服务的用户互动，而无需为每个需要共享的资源创建一个帐户。

每个服务实例的管理员可以在存在严重问题的情况下阻止其他实例。用户也可以阻止其他用户或整个实例，以改善自己的体验。

联邦宇宙平台的例子

最近受到了很多关注的联邦宇宙平台是 Mastodon，它专注于微博客（类似于 Twitter）。然而 Mastodon 只是联邦宇宙的一个组成部分。还有更多：


微博客：Mastodon、Pleroma、Misskey

博客：Write.as、Read.as

夏仲翼先生辞世。5月28日早晨在朋友圈看到这个消息，几天来头脑里都是夏老师的身影、动作、声音。
一
夏老师给我们讲“外国文学史”课时，五十六、五十七岁，这是现在从他出生于1931年来推算的，当时，我们这些二十出头的学生哪里会注意这个。他走进教室，常常气喘吁吁——从市区赶到学校，路程不近——微胖的身体在讲台上站定，把一个大手提包放到讲桌上，拿出眼镜盒，取出一副眼镜，换下戴着的眼镜。我们曾经津津乐道夏老师开讲前一副眼镜换另一副眼镜的标准程式，赋予它审美的意味，却从来没去想其实是老花镜和近视镜的换来换去——我们粗略地把老师分成年轻教师和老教师，依据只是一眼看上去的感觉，有的老师不到五十岁已经被我们认定为老教师——夏老师似乎超越了这个划分，我们没往这方面想，而是被别的东西吸引住了。
别的东西是什么？没人说得清。据说女生们称夏老师为“我们的罗切斯特先生”；男生里居然有人研究起夏老师的穿着，他常穿夹克，看上去和普通的夹克没大差别，但就是不一样。还有同学猜测夏老师念过教会学校，但苦于没法证实。总之，我们对夏老师充满了方方面面的好奇，实际上却几乎一无所知。
这份好奇当然是由夏老师的课堂引发的。1987年下半年和1988年上半年，夏老师给我们上了两个学期的课，每周三个学时，从古希腊讲到十九世纪末二十世纪初。那些年，我们还处在不知天高地厚的青春躁动中，夏老师的文学史课，却让我们不知不觉中沉浸到广阔而绵长的丰富世界。我们那时候就觉得，何其幸运，遇到这样的老师。后来我读研究生，陈思和老师告诉我，他的外国文学史就是夏老师上的，从他们七七级开始，夏老师就一直给中文系开这门课。我这才反应过来：幸运的不单单是我们这个班。夏老师坦言，喜欢给中文系上课。我并不清楚夏老师给中文系上课结束于哪一年，有多少级学生幸运受益；只知道有相当长的时期，中文系的老师到外文系讲中国…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[当你坚持最简场景时，你最终会得到最简单的解决方案。


在前面的文章中，我已经解释了为什么将编程问题看作一整群丧尸来处理是错误的。我用 ZOMBIES 方法来解释为什么循序渐进地处理问题更好。

ZOMBIES 表示以下首字母缩写：


Z – 最简场景（Zero）

O – 单元素场景（One）

M – 多元素场景（Many or more complex）

B – 边界行为（Boundary behaviors）

I – 接口定义（Interface definition）

E – 处理特殊行为（Exercise exceptional behavior）

S – 简单场景用简单的解决方案（Simple scenarios, simple solutions）


在系列的前四篇文章中，我展示了 ZOMBIES 方法的前六个原则（LCTT译注：原文为前五个，应为笔误）。

第一篇中 实现了最简场景，它为代码提供了最简可行路径。第二篇文章中执行了 单元素场景和多元素场景上的测试。第三篇中介绍了 边界和接口。 第四篇中处理 特殊行为。在本文中，我将介绍最后一项：简单场景用简单的解决方案。

简单场景用简单的解决方案

回顾这个网购 API 的实现过程，你会发现总是有目的性地坚持考虑最简单的场景。在这个过程中，最终你会得到最简单的解决方案。

ZOMBIES 方法通过坚持简洁性来帮助你交付健壮优雅的解决方案。

胜利了吗?

似乎一切工作都结束了，一个不那么认真负责的工程师很可能会宣布胜利。但开明的工程师总是会探索得更深一点。

我一直推荐做 变异测试mutation testing。在圆满结束这个练习项目，开始新的征程之前，用变异测试来敲打敲打你的解决方案是明智的。况且你也不得不承认，变异很适合对付丧尸的。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[老一代书店从业人员夏淡人先生（1919-2010），曾在所撰《姑苏书肆忆旧》一文中列举了一些过去旧书店常见的对于古籍的作伪方法：1、挖补目录，如一书后面已残缺，经过挖补，可充全书。2、重刊目录，如有丛书残本，另题书名刻上书目录，即是全书。3、将覆刻宋、元版之书抽去重刊牌记，叙，跋，用红茶水染上灰黄之色以充宋、元旧本，如影宋相台本《尚书》，苏写《陶渊明集》。4、改头换面：如明刻《晋书》把它改名为《两晋人物传》，加上著者为无锡王达，配补上王同愈所写书签，还盖上“孤本”之章，买书者当然视为珍宝。5、是仿著：山东图书馆套色影印黄丕烈校本《穆天子传》，原底本是明程荣刻本，他们仍用程刻白皮纸印的底本，将黄的校跋摹描书上，印章亦描下仿刻……6、加刻牌记：如《尚书传大全》，清末期覆刻元本，就在序后加上“至元X年泉州府儒学刻本”，以充作元刻本。（以上转引自邓乾彬先生《文学山房作伪公案》一文。）事实上，古籍的作伪手段还不止如此，比如伪钤，就是书估最经常使用的一种方式。沈津《说藏书印的鉴定》一文中就曾指出：“解放前，苏州专门经营古旧书的文学山房江杏溪、杭州抱经堂朱遂翔等都是专门伪造名人藏书印的老手，假印一抽斗，都是数十方以上，什么惠定宇、顾广圻、莫友芝等等应有尽有，想用谁的就顺手钤上。潘师景郑先生曾告诉我，这些都是他亲眼所见。陈乃乾先生也回忆说，在上海设立古书流通处的陈立炎，亦伪刻藏书家卢文弨抱经楼等印章，且雇抄手三人，每日以旧棉纸传抄各书，并将假印钤上。”与伪钤名人藏印相呼应的是，还有造作名人伪跋的，掺杂于文献前后，藉此增价。
事实上，上海博物馆所藏的一些宋元古籍和拓本中，也存在若干书估作伪的现象。这正可以说明，书估作伪的对象不仅仅是明清古籍，宋元本中，因为种种缘故，也会存在作伪现象。故而我们在研究过程中，一定要注意去除宋元本本身的光环效应，深入考核，去伪存精。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[夏仲翼（1931年-2023年5月28日）

夏仲翼先生辞世。5月28日早晨在朋友圈看到这个消息，几天来头脑里都是夏老师的身影、动作、声音。
一
夏老师给我们讲“外国文学史”课时，五十六、五十七岁，这是现在从他出生于1931年来推算的，当时，我们这些二十出头的学生哪里会注意这个。他走进教室，常常气喘吁吁——从市区赶到学校，路程不近——微胖的身体在讲台上站定，把一个大手提包放到讲桌上，拿出眼镜盒，取出一副眼镜，换下戴着的眼镜。我们曾经津津乐道夏老师开讲前一副眼镜换另一副眼镜的标准程式，赋予它审美的意味，却从来没去想其实是老花镜和近视镜的换来换去——我们粗略地把老师分成年轻教师和老教师，依据只是一眼看上去的感觉，有的老师不到五十岁已经被我们认定为老教师——夏老师似乎超越了这个划分，我们没往这方面想，而是被别的东西吸引住了。
别的东西是什么？没人说得清。据说女生们称夏老师为“我们的罗切斯特先生”；男生里居然有人研究起夏老师的穿着，他常穿夹克，看上去和普通的夹克没大差别，但就是不一样。还有同学猜测夏老师念过教会学校，但苦于没法证实。总之，我们对夏老师充满了方方面面的好奇，实际上却几乎一无所知。
这份好奇当然是由夏老师的课堂引发的。1987年下半年和1988年上半年，夏老师给我们上了两个学期的课，每周三个学时，从古希腊讲到十九世纪末二十世纪初。那些年，我们还处在不知天高地厚的青春躁动中，夏老师的文学史课，却让我们不知不觉中沉浸到广阔而绵长的丰富世界。我们那时候就觉得，何其幸运，遇到这样的老师。后来我读研究生，陈思和老师告诉我，他的外国文学史就是夏老师上的，从他们七七级开始，夏老师就一直给中文系开这门课。我这才反应过来：幸运的不单单是我们这个班。夏老师坦言，喜欢给中文系上课。我并不清楚夏老师给中文系上课结束于哪一年，有多少级学生幸运受益；只知道有相当长的时期，中文系的老师到外文系讲中国…]]></summary>

        <updated>2023-06-05T03:56:15.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[“kauditd” is a kernel thread which is started using the “kthread_run” function (https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v6.4-rc4/source/kernel/audit.c#L1700). The kernel thread is calling the “kauditd_thread” function, this function is responsible for sending audit logs to userspace (https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v6.4-rc4/source/kernel/audit.c#L828).
 Overall, the kernel mechanism in the Linux kernel has a couple of goals: integrate fully with LSMs (https://medium.com/@boutnaru/linux-security-lsm-linux-security-modules-907bbcf8c8b4), minimal run-time overhead when performing auditing, ability to disable system call auditing at boot time, allow to be used by other parts of the kernel for auditing, netlink interface to userspace and support for filtering to minimize the information sent to user-mode (https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v6.4-rc4/source/kernel/audit.c#L11). 
 Thus, we can say “kauditd” is the kernel component of the “Linux Auditing System” which handles the audit events - as shown in the diagram below. In order to configure which set of rules are going to be loaded in the kernel audit system we can use the “/etc/audit/audit.rules” file. This file can hold configuration in one of three categories: control (configuring the audit system), file system rules monitoring rules and system call monitoring rules (https://manpages.debian.org/unstable/auditd/audit.rules.7.en.html).
 Lastly, by using the “Linux Auditing System” the system administrator can investigate what happens in the system for the purpose of debugging or in case of a security incident. We can also use the “auditctl” utility get/add/delete rules as part of Linux's kernel audit system (https://linux.die.net/man/8/auditctl). Also, there are great examples for “audit.rules” in GitHub (one example is https://github.com/Neo23x0/auditd/blob/master/audit.rules).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Yeah, a bit strange question, but in a few weeks is the birthday of a friend of mine and I want to give him something related to Linux because both of us share this hobbie, the thing is that I really don't know what to give to him.
 I thought on give him a new AMD GPU, bit he recently upgraded it, so that wouldn't be convenient. I also thought on give him a steam deck. He lives in latam, so it's a little hard to him to order a steam deck, but the thing is that he is a neet (shut in), so he doesn't leave his apartment that much (and obviously, we live in latam and go out with that type of device is really a bad idea here...)
 The last thing I had on my mind was a raspberry pi like device (since currently is almost impossible to get a original one for what I have seen) and maybe a Thinkpad since he doesn't have a laptop, only a desktop. 
 What do you guys think? What is a better one? A raspberry pi like device oe a thinkpad? Or do you have any other recommendation? Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've always been tempted to permanently switch to Linux but the fact that I'm just making my life harder refrains me from doing so.
 I want to pay for Linux, I want to be tracked so its services are improved, I want programs that are actually useful in the real world.
 Windows file system is awful and incoherent, OneDrive is shoved down my throat, Edge is always sneakily trying to copy my data from Chrome and recently, those widgets which would be somewhat useful if they didn't made it so they are impossible to alter to my preferences.
 I just want Adobe for Linux... but it has no chance of happening because there isn't a significant desktop userbase for they to care. It's quite discouraging that even if I were to stoically switch and contribute my little part, it won't change a thing because for better or worse, money moves the world.
 On the other hand, paid distros such as ElementaryOS are not any better than the free ones nor have shown any significant improvement. So, I'm at a loss.
 Maybe this is just how things are supposed to be... with Linux desktop being an OS that cater to a specialized userbase segment and that's okay.

But I hear the same old song every time, "Linux is for (popular social illness diagnosis), Linux is unstable, Linux can't play vidja games, Linux is only for this and that, and isn't a real OS". I get, if you installed Linux had too many problems with it, and decided to switch back, because it was too overwhelming, but why be against the concept at all. I seriously don't get that, it's competition towards these multi billion
 tech giants, who exactly roots for them? 
 My post was removed, for saying a bad word, I assume it was the A-word, which I didn't even know was bad.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[这是我们所知的计算机编程的终结

纽约时报发表文章《这是我们所知的计算机编程的终结》谈到，虽然人工智能可能不会意味着编程的结束（世界仍然需要具有高级编码技能的人），但它可能标志着一种新的编程的开始 ——“一种不需要我们学习代码，而是将人类语言指令转变为软件的编程”。计算机编程从一种极客爱好变成了一种严肃职业，曾经很多人都教诲孩子们去学习编程，但编程一直在走向越来越简单的道路上。曾经焦虑孩子们不喜欢编程，与未来脱节，但现在，“等到他们找工作的时候，编码可能就像我的第一台电脑一样过时了。”


消息来源：纽约时报



老王点评：作为一个计算机专家，我也曾经希望我的孩子能喜欢编程，精通编程，但是似乎他除了喜欢游戏，并不喜欢编程。我也为此焦虑过，现在看起来大可不必，就像我并没有学会（或者说继承）我父亲精通的机电和电路一样，每个人都有自己的方向和需要掌握的技能。




世界上最受欢迎的在线编程课向人工智能寻求帮助

哈佛大学的 CS50 是一门计算机科学的入门课程，校内有数百名学生参加，网上有超过 4 万名学生参加。但即使有 100 多名现实生活中的教学助理，也很难与越来越多从不同时区登录的、具有不同知识和经验水平的学生充分接触。CS50 计划使用人工智能来评分作业、教授编码和个性化的学习提示。他们现在正在微调一个人工智能系统来标记学生的工作，并测试一个虚拟教学助理来评估和提供对学生编程的反馈。


消息来源：MSN



老王点评：结合上一条，既然人工智能可以干的更好，学生们何必再去学习普通的编程技能呢？




红帽放弃维护 LibreOffice RPM 包

红帽公司负责大部分桌面工作的显示系统团队多年来一直在 Fedora 中维护 LibreOffice 的 RPM 包。但现在他们将把更多精力投放到 Wayland、HDR 支持及工作站用户需要的一系列改进上，因此决定从未来的 RHEL 版本开始，停止把 LibreOffice 作为 RHEL 的一部分。但他们仍然会在目前支持的 RHEL 7/8/9 中维护 LibreOffice 相关的补丁。他们希望用户去使用 Flatpak 版的 LibreOffice。当然，他们也不反对任何社区用户接管这些 RPM 包的维护，并指出这是一个相当大的软件包和依赖关系块，需要大量的工作来维持。


消息来源：LWN



老王点评：作为红帽来说似乎这样的决策无可厚非，但是我怎么觉得这是红帽将用户推向 Flatpak 的一种潜意识行为呢？]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[李敏金（章静 绘）

多年前，还在艾奥瓦大学读创意写作的时候，我写过一个对话驱动的短篇，用的是全知视角。该习作遭到了工作坊同学的猛烈批评。如今想来，我知道那个小说有很多问题，但在当时，作为一个牙牙学语的外国人，我把失败经验总结为不能用全知视角。放眼望去，几乎所有的同学都在用第一或第三人称限知视角写作，我自然以为全知视角早已在美国过时。可当我真的依样画葫芦，即便我再努力去呈现不同人物的视角，还是觉得自己的小说世界变窄了。
可以想见我读到韩裔美国作家李敏金（Min Jin Lee）作品时的激动。无论是首部长篇《百万富翁的免费午餐》（Free Food for Millionaires）还是这几年受到全球瞩目的作品《柏青哥》（Pachinko），她用的都是全知视角，而且该视角在不同人物之间切换自如。以《百万富翁的免费午餐》为例，凯西从常青藤大学毕业后，没有找到工作，她的父亲就说自己不是百万富翁，不能再供养她了。凯西的反应是：“你没能成为百万富翁，该怪谁呢？”我刚被这句回嘴逗乐，全知叙事者马上介绍了凯西父亲的经历，原来他在战争中失去了一切。等我终于又开始同情他时，他猛地扇了凯西一耳光。全知视角似乎在和读者玩着心理游戏。
我最佩服的是李敏金的作品容纳了这么多人物这么多不同的声音，令我想起了陀思妥耶夫斯基的复调小说。读者必须直面持着不同信仰，拥有不同价值观的人，不是几个主要人物，而是十几个乃至几十个人物，在他们的冲撞和冲突之中，我们理解为什么人会做出极端的事情来。在政治上愈加两极分化的美国，李敏金的作品让我们看到“理解”或“共情”不是挂在嘴上的漂亮话，而是一条荆棘路。
最近，在接受专访时，李敏金谈到了全知视角的运用、如何理解他人、对真理的追求以及教育的目的。

我想先借机表达我的感激，您的小说启发我重新去认识全知视角。现如今…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I like many believe that containerization is the future of Linux app packaging and distribution; Flatpak seems to be the obvious leader in this realm. That's why I want to bring it to people's attention that there is a fatal flaw in the xdg-document-portal that Flatpaks use to access files outside the sandbox.
 [my layman explanation] Currently a FUSE filesystem is used as a middle man and opens a file descriptor and provides it to the sandboxed app, however when the app is done with the file the file descriptor is left open indefinitely. This has several consequences. One the open files add up, depending on your usage and how long your pc has been online it is not uncommon to see dozens if not hundreds of open files. If any of those open files are on a removable drive it prevents that drive from being unmounted. Worst of all if one of those files is deleted the resources are NOT released. Right now users of Flatpak are silently losing drive space because of this. In a few extreme examples from the issues section of the GitHub people had their entire drives filled.
 The devs are aware of the issue, it has existed for a several years however no one currently working on the project knows how to fix it.
 Seeing as how important (in my view) Flatpak is to the future of Linux I am calling on any and all knowledgeable and able developers to try and a provide a solution to this issue. Discussions, ideas, pull requests...anything.
 for reference
 Thanks.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[修复 Arch Linux 中 “invalid or corrupted package” 错误的简单指南。


我在物理机和虚拟机中都安装有一些 Arch Linux 系统，我会在需要时访问它们。将近两个月后，当我尝试使用 sudo pacman -Syu 升级其中一个中的 Arch Linux 时，我遇到了数百个这样的错误：



问题是当你遇到上面的错误时，你无法升级/更新你的 Arch 系统。即使你同步镜像或获得更快的镜像。所以，如果你运行 sudo pacman -Syyu，错误仍然存在。这就造成了困难，因为在修复此问题之前你无法安装任何其他软件包。

原因

当你在 Arch Linux 系统上安装或升级软件包时，pacman 会根据 archlinux-keyring 软件包中的密钥检查软件包的数字签名。此验证过程可确保你下载和安装的软件包未经修改且来自受信任的来源。

它包含用于 验证包的真实性和完整性 和 pacman 中的密钥环。archlinux-keyring 包由 Arch Linux 开发人员定期更新，以包含新的可信密钥并撤销任何泄露的密钥。

如果你的 Arch Linux 系统很长时间没有更新，那么各种包的数字签名可能会不匹配。更改后的密钥可能与你系统中的密钥不匹配。

因此出现错误了。

修复

要修复 Arch Linux 中的 “invalid or corrupted package (PGP signature)” 错误，你需要从 Core 仓库安装/更新 archlinux-keyring 包。从终端运行以下命令：

sudo pacman -S archlinux-keyring


上述命令完成后，运行升级：

sudo pacman -Syu


这将解决问题，你可以在 Arch Linux 中继续你的正常活动。建议始终保持 archlinux-keyring 包为最新，以维护 Arch Linux 系统的安全性和完整性。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[美国空军否认人工智能无人机杀死其操作员

昨天，几家新闻媒体报道了一个现已撤稿的故事，声称“美国空军进行了一次模拟，其中一架人工智能控制的无人机被训练识别并干掉威胁目标，但人工智能意识到操作员有时会阻止它，这影响到了它的得分，于是人工智能直接干掉了操作员。接下来的模拟告知人工智能不能杀死操作员，于是它干掉了通讯塔，以避免操作员阻止它”。这一故事迅速传播后，美国空军否认曾经进行过任何模拟，“空军部门没有进行任何这样的人工智能无人机模拟，并继续致力于道德和负责任地使用人工智能技术。”而讲故事的人说他 “说错话了，……这个模拟来自军方以外的假设性‘思想实验’，基于合理的情景和可能的结果，而不是美国空军实际的模拟。”

老王点评：这故事耸人听闻，但是也不是不可能，毕竟人工智能的脑回路和人类不同。




谷歌指责微软的云计算软件许可“税”

早在 2019 年，如果你在自己的基础设施上运行微软的软件，如 SQL Server 等，你只需要支付微软的许可证费用，但如果你想在公有云上运行，你需要额外购买许可证。被列入目标的云供应商，如 AWS、GCP、阿里云是微软的最大竞争对手，为了宣称这是非歧视性的，微软也将 Azure 列入了该名单。然而，微软又创建了独家的 Azure 混合效益计划，这意味着虽然客户 “技术上” 不能把原来的许可证带到 Azure，但他们可以把许可证换成 Azure 的基于 SaaS 的许可证。这导致如果你在 Azure 上运行微软的软件，与其他供应商相比，要便宜五倍，相当于客户要向微软交“税”。谷歌云副总裁称，反垄断监管机构 “开始了解情况”，并正在提出问题。

老王点评：微软这玩的太溜了，这么玩真不怕反垄断机构么？




Meta 公司在销售元宇宙的 VR 头显，但他们自己不用

Facebook 公司将自己更名为 Meta Platforms，以在“元宇宙”上取得领先地位，按他们的描述，这是一个数字沉浸式世界，人们可以在家里戴着 VR 头显相聚在一起做事，包括一起工作。该公司在周四推出了其 Quest 3 头显。预计苹果将在周一推出一个与之竞争的头戴设备。但据 11 名现任和前任的 Meta 员工称，整个 Meta 公司的员工普遍没有使用头显，特别是没有在工作会议上使用。一位前雇员说，即使是 VR 部门，也不经常使用它来工作。


消息来源：彭博社



老王点评：要我说，Meta 就踏踏实实放弃元宇宙梦想，好好搞人工智能就好了。不过，我也对苹果下周发布的头戴设备很感兴趣，或许能突破现有的头显的局限呢。]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[许多流行的在线市场 —— 以及一些你从未听说过的市场 —— 说明了基于社会关系的经济如何能够发挥作用。


一些最熟悉的网络共享经济的例子开始时规模很小。比如 Airbnb，它从三个 空气床airbed 开始，在 2008 年成为 AirBed and Breakfast（Airbnb）。截至 2016 年，已有 7000 万客人通过 Airbnb 住进了陌生人的家。基于互联网的平台将拥有未使用资源（过剩空间）的人与可以使用它的其他人联系起来，并为他们提供建立信任的方式。这是共享业务模型的完美示例。

在 先前的文章 中，我介绍了基于社会联系的企业背后的原则，借鉴了 Arun Sundararajan 的书《共享经济：就业的终结和人群资本主义的兴起》。我将讨论共享业务的几个例子。

一个连接的市场

根据 Sundararajan 的说法，基于人群的资本主义的经济基础优于目前基于利润的商业模式，因为这种经济的原材料：空间、时间、物品和技能都是过剩的。因为它们已经存在，所以不会产生额外的成本来提供它们。你可以认为这是一种改进的资源利用保护、环境保护或可持续性经济的形式。

人际关系是共享经济的一个重要价值组成部分。例如，一些共享汽车运营商希望乘客坐在前排座位上，以产生对话和互动。这种服务是关于社会联系以及乘车共享的。由于许多司机都是兼职，作为一个小的副业，互动对他们来说可能和收到的费用一样有价值。

以下是传统出租车服务的两个弱点：


服务不周

由于业务结构（司机或公司的车辆所有权），占用率（利用率）差


使用数字技术应用程序的基于人群的公私合营可以利用友好的人拥有的去中心化过剩能力，而不是单一公司拥有的集中式系统。热情好客，并且没有额外的前期投资。有一些网站可以将杂货的购买和运送外包，有一个应用程序可以帮助代客泊车服务使用 GPS 定位汽车和停车位，还有邮件取件服务、洗衣取件、遛狗等等。

平台如何建立信任

eBay 始于 1995 年，它将邻里间的车库销售搬到了网上，并为孤立的书商和旧货店主提供了一种在当地社区之外扩大市场范围的方法。eBay 系统有许多保障措施，通过交易过程保护买家和卖家，所以即使买家和卖家之间有很大的地理距离，eBay 也能保持交易伙伴的信任。对于共享经济中提供的服务，地点更为重要。点对点服务市场可能更适合人口密集的城市地区。

建立供应商和用户的信任是共享经济成功的重要因素。要确定是否信任提供商，消费者必须考虑每个平台的审查过程。他们的评级系统质量如何？一些组织使用 Facebook 好友作为证明来确认可信赖的人。有的平台完全控制支付系统，支付有保障，有的则不然。

BlaBlaCar 的联合创始人 Frederic Mazzella 认为信任是其公司业务的核心，并且对信任的重要性充满热情。BlaBlaCar 的公司总部有一个真人大小的纸板剪裁 “Trust Man”，这是一个穿着斗篷的超级英雄，他的连身衣上印有 “T” 字样。 Mazzella 的信任概念基于他所谓的 D.R.E.A.M.S. 框架：声明的、评级的、参与的、基于活动的、适度的和社交的。该公司一直致力于加深对可信交换的理解。

协作和社区建设

OuiShare 组织协调活动以促进协作。2021 年 6 月，他们在为期三天的 OuiShare Fest 期间聚集了 600 多人，其中包括会议、研讨会、表演和表演。通过这次活动，OuiShare 渴望通过将来自不同背景的人聚集在一起来建立社交联系、项目和协作。参与者探讨了他们有什么多余的以及可能需要和共享的东西。该小组起源于法国，现在遍布欧洲 20 个国家，它提供了一个共享的实验平台，使连接者和成员能够访问知识、工具和国际网络，从中学习和汲取灵感。你可以将其称为未充分利用者的透明度。

服务平台为有知识、技能或才能的人提供业余时间。例如，一些平台为教师提供特定的知识和技能，以换取其他知识或多余的物质商品，而不是金钱。

本文是共享经济系列文章的一部分。 在 第一篇 中，我解释了共享商业模式及其价值。在这篇文章中，我给出了很多现在正在运行的平台的例子。 在以后的文章中，我将探讨共享商业模式将如何演变。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[6月2日，有流传截图显示，腾讯创始人马化腾在微信聊天中分享了一篇名为《聊聊裁员的事》的文章，并表示：“后续环境挑战目前看还挺大。你们要收紧队形，做一些余量考虑，应对一些突发的挑战，不可过于乐观。”


这一截图引起外界新一轮的猜测，腾讯是不是要裁员了？


对此，腾讯公关总监在朋友圈发文称，该聊天记录为马化腾在外部聊天群发送的内容，“本意是跟一家投资公司管理层做一些居安思危和降本增效的探讨，没想到流传出来，越说越歪，以为是内部讲话。”


上述《聊聊裁员的事》发布于微信公众号“九边”，发布时间为5月27日。


该文提及互联网行业的工资状况，指出此前行业有许多投资和项目，彼时招聘的员工工资都处于较高位置，但近两年开始过“紧日子”，于是就有通过裁高薪员工，再招薪资相对较低的员工的现象。


此外，该文称，互联网该做的应用都做出来了，叠加预期减弱，大量的“预研项目”已被砍掉，目前“大厂”主要方向已经不是传统的互联网，而是云计算、人工智能等领域，并不需要过多人力，而更需要科研人才。


以下为《聊聊裁员的事》的全文。

根源还是在房地产


中国近四十年来的事，几乎都跟三件事有关：


改开；


外贸；


房地产。


因为改开，有了外贸。有了外贸，赚到了钱。把手里的钱，叠加银行借出来的三十年的钱，催生出来了这些年的大繁荣。


大家买房花出去的每一个钢镚，最后都变成了上游水泥建材工厂的收入、房产销售的收入、还有政府的收入。大家有了钱，继续消费，这也是为啥甚至汽车行业，都和房地产周期有关，比如房地产繁荣…]]></summary>

it be known that LibreOffice will be dropped from a future Red Hat
Enterprise Linux release, and the future of its support in Fedora is
unclear as well.


	The Red Hat Display Systems team (the team behind most of Red Hat’s
	desktop efforts) has maintained the LibreOffice packages in Fedora
	for years as part of our work to support LibreOffice for Red Hat
	Enterprise Linux. We are adjusting our engineering priorities for
	RHEL for Workstations and focusing on gaps in Wayland, building out
	HDR support, building out what’s needed for color-sensitive work,
	and a host of other refinements required by Workstation users. This
	is work that will improve the workstation experience for Fedora as
	well as RHEL users, and which, we hope, will be positively received
	by the entire Linux community.

	The tradeoff is that we are pivoting away from work we had been
	doing on desktop applications and will cease shipping LibreOffice
	as part of RHEL starting in a future RHEL version. This also limits
	our ability to maintain it in future versions of Fedora.]]></summary>

学界一般把英国诗人约翰·弥尔顿（1608-1674）的生平和创作分为三个阶段：第一个阶段（1608-1639），自十七岁进入剑桥大学基督学院，毕业后没有参加工作，而是随家人搬迁至位于伯克郡的霍顿村，弥尔顿在此居住了五年，把他的大部分时间花在阅读上，并且“继续显然已经着手的学术研究”（《弥尔顿传》，95页，以下引用此书仅标注页码）。1638年春，弥尔顿像当时的英国年轻贵族子弟一样前往意大利游历，1639年8月回到英国，这样也就结束了弥尔顿第一阶段的生活。这一阶段弥尔顿创作了一些较短的诗歌和戏剧作品，如《快乐的人》《沉思的人》《科玛斯》《利西达斯》。第二个阶段（1640-1660），这是弥尔顿从事政治活动的时期，1649年即国王查理一世被处死的这年，弥尔顿被任命为国务会议的外语部拉丁文秘书，负责处理外交文书。1652年，弥尔顿双目失明，于是他作为拉丁文秘书的公务职能缩小到了有限的范围，比较繁重的任务交给了别人，但他仍为清教主义的革命政权四处奔走。这一阶段弥尔顿的主要作品是论战性质的政治小册子和十四行诗，政治小册子一共有二十五本，其中二十一本是用英语写的，四本是用拉丁文写的。十四行诗的数量不多，一共是二十四首，其中十九首是用英语写的，五首用意大利文写成。第三个阶段（1660-1674），查理二世复辟后，弥尔顿受到迫害，曾遭囹圄之灾，经人多方说情方被释放，此后幽居家中闭门不出，通过口授由人笔录从事著作，三大史诗作品《失乐园》《复乐园》《力士参孙》完成于这一阶段（参见王佐良《英国诗史》）。马克·帕蒂森的《弥尔顿传略》（金发燊、颜俊华译，生活·读书·新知三联书店，1992年版）里差不多也是如此划分的：弥尔顿的一生是个三幕的戏剧。第一幕显示出他潜…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[想要一个开源的 Discord 机器人来增强你的 Discord 服务器功能吗？我们为你筛选了以下列表。


Discord 最初是一个玩家和朋友们聚会的平台。截至 2022 年，Discord 拥有超过 1.5 亿用户，甚至在 拒绝 微软 120 亿美元的收购提案之后仍然如此。

如果你是第一次听说 Discord，请将其视为类似 Slack 的东西，但是有无数有趣的功能可以创建社区（即“服务器”）。

在所有功能中，Discord 机器人允许自动化某些事情或增添服务器的趣味性。但是大多数机器人是专有的。因此，在这个列表中，我推荐一些最好的开源 Discord 机器人。

注意： 机器人可能会传播恶意软件并影响整个 Discord 服务器。你必须确保不添加你不了解的机器人。这就是为什么你可能希望信任开源的 Discord 机器人而不是其他选择的原因。

1、MonitoRSS



亮点：


RSS 源

过滤器和订阅

托管


MonitoRSS 是一个有用的 Discord 机器人，可以使你的社区从支持 RSS 的任何来源接收新闻。

它是一个相当受欢迎的机器人，能够按预期工作。你可以将其添加到特定的频道，自定义其外观，并在 Discord 服务器上获取新闻更新。

它还可以让你过滤 RSS 内容，允许用户根据自己的喜好订阅。这可以使用 Web 接口控制面板进行管理和自定义。

可以在其 GitHub 页面 上了解更多信息。

2、ModMail



亮点：


允许用户联系服务器的官方成员

可以自行托管

托管版本

可选高级功能

In the comments fellow HN'ers were discussing the possibilities of XSS attacks using the password.
This had me thinking, have there actually been such successful attacks in your experience and how regular are they? Think of some kind of ridiculous XSS using ... or anything similar.
Are these still successfully happening in 2023?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[NAPI stands for “New API” which is used to reduce the number of received interrupts. Think about cases in which the network driver receives a large number of packets at a fast pace. (https://www.hitchhikersguidetolearning.com/2023/04/09/handling-receive-packets-via-napi/). If we think about it in the case of a Gigabit network card and an MTU of 1500 the CPU will get about 90K of interrupt per second.
 Thus, we can say that NAPI is an extension to the Linux packet processing framework, which is done for improving performance for high speed networking. This is performed using interrupt mitigation and packet throttling. It is important to say that the addition of NAPI does not break backward compatibility (https://wiki.linuxfoundation.org/networking/napi).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[6月2日消息，据报道，当地时间周三，特斯拉CEO埃隆·马斯克（Elon Musk）遭遇了一宗有关虚拟货币的投资人集体诉讼，原告指控称，马斯克存在操控虚拟货币“狗狗币”（Dogecoin）的内幕交易行为，这些违法举动让投资人损失了几十亿美元。


一些虚拟货币投资人将诉状提交到了美国纽约曼哈顿的一家联邦地方法庭。原告指控称，马斯克通过各种各样的手段操纵了狗狗币市场，其中包括Twitter网站帖子、其他收费的影响力账号，2021年在全国广播公司做节目嘉宾，以及其他吸引舆论关注的高调言论。原告称，马斯克本人通过他自己以及特斯拉公司控制的狗狗币钱包获得了不菲利润，但是却造成了其他投资人的损失。


原告举例称，今年初，马斯克将Twitter网站的蓝鸟标志，修改为狗狗币的柴犬标志图案，这一明显力挺的举动导致狗狗币价格暴涨了三成，很快在四月份，马斯克就抛售了价值1.24亿美元的狗狗币。


原告在诉状中表示，马斯克对狗狗币进行了有意的舆论宣传、市场操纵以及内幕交易，这让他本人和旗下的公司受益，但却构成了对其他狗狗币投资人的欺诈。


对于这一诉讼，马斯克和特斯拉公司的律师斯皮罗（Alex Spiro）并未置评，上述原告的律师方也尚未发表评论。


收到诉状的联邦地方法庭法官阿尔文·海勒斯坦（Alvin Hellerstein）表示，他有可能支持第三版修改的起诉书进入后续流程，起诉书并不存在对被告的偏见性质指控。


另外对于新修改的诉状，海勒斯坦法官批准了原告的一项请求，即不再把“狗狗币基金会”列为被告，该基金会的律师赛斯·乐文（Seth Levine）表示，这是一个合理的举动。


根据彭博社报道，马斯克重新登顶全球首富。此外，他本人涉猎广泛，也经常在Twitter上讨论虚拟货币。在起诉书中，原告认为马斯克一直在操作狗狗币，导致两年之内狗狗币价格暴涨了36000%，之后价格又瞬间崩塌。


据报道，狗狗币投资人对于马斯克的这一起诉，准确说从去年6月就已经开始，之后多次修改诉状，周三提交的是第三次修改的诉状，增加了一些新的罪名指控。


今年3月，面对狗狗币投资人第二个版本的诉状，马斯克和特斯拉公司要求法庭驳回诉讼，认为指控纯属“凭空杜撰”，一些说法并不公平。

 Terrateam is Terraform continuous delivery. Purpose-built for GitHub with an expressive configuration file, popular third-party integrations, advanced features like OIDC, access controls, drift detection, and more. Self-Hosted and Cloud versions available. Our self-hosted version has feature parity with Terrateam Cloud.
 Some of the Terrateam features:
  
Terraform automation with pull requests
 
Access Controls using GitHub Teams & Users
 
Apply Requirements
 
CDKTF & Terragrunt support
 
Cost Estimation with Infracost
 
Destination Branches (GitFlow)
 
Drift Detection & Reconciliation
 
Pre/Post Hooks
 
Custom Workflows
 
OPA Policy Testing with Conftest
 
Static Analysis with Chekcov
 
OIDC for AWS and GCP
 
 We just released our self-hosted version available here: https://github.com/terrateamio/terrateam
 This is our first step in going open-source. Not open-core but open-source. We won't be charging for the enterprise features like OIDC, access controls, etc.
 We're currently looking for feature requests on how we can improve Terrateam. Looking forward to folks kicking the tires.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[日本表示版权不适用于 AI 训练

日本政府最近重申，它不会对用于人工智能培训的数据实施版权。该政策允许人工智能使用任何数据，“无论它是出于非营利还是商业目的，无论它是复制以外的行为，还是从非法网站或其他地方获得的内容”。日本政府认为版权方面的担忧，特别是与动漫和其他视觉媒体有关的担忧，阻碍了该国在人工智能技术方面的进步。


消息来源：Technomancers



老王点评：关于 AI 和版权，这确实是一个值得思考的领域。如果 AI 只能使用公共数据训练，显然会影响 AI 的结果。现在非英语的训练语料显然要比英语语料少得多，日本的这个做法值得参考。




荷兰政府网站必须强制遵守 security.txt 标准

荷兰国家政府数字信任中心宣布，荷兰政府网站从 5 月 25 日开始必须强制遵守 security.txt 标准。Web 服务器上的 security.txt 包含了联系信息，允许道德黑客在服务器上发现漏洞之后可以立即联络合适的人去修复，从而减少网络犯罪分子利用漏洞的机会。目前有逾 8.8 万个荷兰域名有 security.txt 文件。


消息来源：Postsen



老王点评：这种行业规范确实需要国家来推动才好。




Reddit 也准备对 API 收费，杀死第三方客户端

继 Twitter 之后，Reddit 最近修改了 API 政策，计划对 API 访问收费。开发者发现 Reddit 给出了一份无法接受的报价，5000 万次请求 1.2 万美元，这意味着第三方客户端除了关闭别无选择。当然，Reddit 认为相比 Twitter 的 5000 万推文 4.2 万美元 API 定价要合理的多。和 Twitter 的情况类似，第三方客户端一大优势也是不展示 Reddit 的广告。


消息来源：Reddit



老王点评：只是计较于第三方客户端占据了本应展示的广告量，却忘记了第三方客户端给生态带来的好处。


回音


在 ChatGPT 杜撰 了 6 个案例之后，美国得州的一位法官禁止递交 AI 撰写的材料，除非其正确性经过了人类验证。并要求律师递交保证书，证明其递交的文件是人类撰写或经过了人类的审核。]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello there, so me and my friend hv created a community for video, audio and image editors who work/use linux for their editing work, called r/linuxediting, currently having 22 members.
 The motive/idea behind the r/linuxediting is to help other fellow linux editors, when i came or permanently switched to linux, i was missing SVP for editing purposes, but it wasnt the option. and i tried kdenlive, because according to the internet it's just the best and then comes the Da Vinci, but da vinci was asking for much higher vram, and hence i couldnt use it, and with kdenlive, the things i wanted to do, just werent there or not working, and then i found Natron ,olive and audacity, great softwares, works like charm, but now the problem was that i didnt knew how to use them, and i things i wanted to do, i didnt knew how to do, and when i searched on internet for tutorials, there were none, and the surprising things was there wasnt a subreddit for linux editing which was extremely disappointing, i had to struggle a LOT to learn and find the things, how to do them, cuz natron is surely good, but beginner friendly? no. And then no wonder why people prefers other proprietary software,like after effects, cuz there are tutorials available for them. and all the subs of natron are dead.
 ​
 And this is where the r/linuxediting comes, i want to create a community where we can post tutorials, and your products/edits made in linux to set a example that you can do many things in linux too.
 so if you want to post, your editing/edits products, tutorials for video, image, audio editing in linux, feel free to post it on r/linuxediting.
 Thank you.

Shell 通过解释命令为 Linux 和类 Unix 系统提供了一个接口，充当用户与操作系统的核心工作之间的中介。

毫无疑问，Bash Shell 是最受欢迎的 Shell 之一，但有些用户喜欢其他 Shell，比如在 macOS 上的默认 Shell——ZSH。但是除了这些流行的 Shell 之外，还存在许多 Shell，具有不同的功能和用途。

在本文中，我们将介绍一些被积极维护并提供不同用户体验的不太常见的 Shell。

1、Fish Shell

谈到除了 Bash、Zsh 之外的 Shell，第一个想到的就是 Fish Shell。

Fish 是一个智能的、用户友好的命令行 Shell，主要适用于类 Unix 操作系统。



Fish Shell 的特点：


根据历史记录提供命令自动建议和补全。

支持 24 位真彩。

支持语法高亮，所有特性都可以开箱即用。


安装 Fish：

Fish 可在几乎所有 Linux 发行版的官方仓库中获得。在 Ubuntu 中，你可以通过以下命令来安装：

sudo apt install fish


Ubuntu 仓库中的版本有点旧。如果你想安装最新版本，可以使用该团队提供的官方 PPA。

sudo apt-add-repository ppa:fish-shell/release-3
sudo apt update
sudo apt install fish

2、Nushell

Nushell（Nu）是一种新型的 Shell，可以在 Linux、macOS、Windows、BSD 等系统上使用。它的哲学和灵感…]]></summary>

发布于 2022 年 5 月 10 日的 Fedora Linux 36，于 2023 年 5 月 16 日达到生命终点。这意味着在此日期之后，Fedora Linux 36 将不再有任何形式的更新，包括安全更新或安全公告。所有被推送到稳定版的 Fedora Linux 36 的更新也将被停止。

Fedora Linux 37，于 2022 年 11 月 15 日发布，将继续接收更新，直到 Fedora Linux 39 发布后大约一个月，即 2023 年 11 月 14 日左右。

我们鼓励 Fedora Linux 36 的用户尽快升级到 Fedora Linux 37，以确保他们继续接收安全更新和错误修复。要升级，你可以按照我下面的详细升级指南进行：


如何从 Fedora 36 工作站升级到 Fedora 37（GUI 和 CLI 方法）


另外，Fedora 38 是最新的版本，你可以尝试全新安装该版本。

Fedora 项目是一个社区支持的项目，开发和维护基于 Linux 内核的自由和开源的操作系统。Fedora 以其前沿的软件和对创新的承诺而闻名。

Fedora 项目每六个月发布一个新版本的 Fedora。每个新版本都是基于上一个版本，包括新功能、错误修复和安全更新。

对于那些想要一个前沿的、不断更新的操作系统的用户来说，Fedora 是一个受欢迎的选择。对于想参与开发自由和开源操作系统的用户来说，它也是一个不错的选择。

《道与逻各斯》冯川译本

张隆溪教授的《道与逻各斯：东西方文学阐释学》（以下简称《道与逻各斯》）一书是他的名作。此书英文版最早出版于1992年（Zhang Longxi, The Tao and the Logos- Literary Hermeneutics, East and West, Durham & London: Duke University Press, 1992），在六年后由四川人民出版社出版了中译本，2006年译本又在江苏教育出版社再版。译者冯川教授的译著颇多，涉及文学、心理学、神学、哲学等各个方面。作者和译者都是资深学者，著作本身又贵为考研参考书，读者自然会期待它呈现出的精彩内容。
然而，笔者的阅读经历却并不美妙。一个偶然的契机，笔者注意到，中译本标注出的里尔克（Rilke）《杜伊诺哀歌》（Duino Elegies）诗句德语原文（111-112页）似有错漏，具体而言，出现在“Engel und Puppe; dann ist endlich Schauspiel”一句，中译为“天使与木偶：最终是一场真正的游戏”。Schauspiel是德语词，意为“戏剧”，此处竟把Schauspiel翻译成了“游戏”（对应的德语是Spiel）。这样的错误缘何出现？购入原书并加以比对之后，笔者方才明白：对应原文是作者引用的英译本里尔克诗集，该句作“Angel and puppet: a real play, finally”。Play在英文中确有“戏剧”之意，Schauspiel翻译为英文的play是合宜的。那么，问题只可能出在英译中的环节，正是译者把英文play转译成汉语“游戏”，失却德语诗句原意。尽管无法断言译者不通德语，但这至少体现出他的疏忽大意。
既然已从词语的翻译“破窗”，索性给这个译本做一次全面检查吧！通过细读原本，笔者总结出…]]></summary>

 What did it even mean to have an 80386? Did you install it into a motherboard? You'd interact with a keyboard and a terminal right? And the terminal would be a display right? You weren't printing on paper at this point in computing?
 And without an OS, how would you connect the terminal and keyboard to the microprocessor? Were standards robust enough in hardware that you could simply plug things into other things, or did you need to take a visit to RadioShack and get a breadboard?
 And what about even getting Linux? If you didn't already have a computer, how would you hear about Linux? How would you download it? 
 I chose the year 1993 for being 30 years ago, but if 1991 would have been any different, I'd love to hear about that too! I'm really interested to hear about mobile Linux

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've seen all of the internet that if you want to set a custom resolution with xrandr using a NVIDIA GPU, for most people it won't let you and will give you an error which looks like this:
 X Error of failed request: BadMatch (invalid parameter attributes) Major opcode of failed request: 153 (RANDR). Minor opcode of failed request: 18 (RRAddOutputMode). Serial number of failed request: 29. Current serial number in output stream: 30
 After months of struggling to find a fix, a link caught my eyes (https://download.nvidia.com/XFree86/Linux-x86_64/396.51/README/xconfigoptions.html) and I've found that if you add this line:
 Option "UseEDID" "FALSE"
 to your xorg.conf file at the monitor section and then reboot, it will give you a bunch of new resolutions and the posibility to finally add your custom resolutions using xrandr without giving the error of the above.
 I hope this is useful for those folks who tried all of the fixes they could ever found on the internet, but didn't get any results, like me.

        <link href="https://linux.cn/article-15868-1.html?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss"/>
        <updated>2023-06-01T16:11:17.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[文档马拉松是为你的开源项目制作或改进文档的一个好方法。


你的开源项目的文档对你的客户至关重要。你的目标受众必须了解你的项目的目的和如何使用它，而文档是弥合这一差距的工具。一个项目很少有真正完成的时候，所以随着你项目的不断改进，资源的维护和更新同样重要。

但是，当你有大量的文档需要维护，但又缺乏资源来保持它的时效性时，会发生什么？答案很简单：举办一个 文档马拉松docathon！

什么是文档马拉松？

文档马拉松就像 黑客马拉松hackathon。黑客马拉松是工程师和社区领袖聚集在一起改进或添加新功能到一个现有的应用的活动。在一个文档马拉松中，同样的合作集中在改进文档上。

文档马拉松可以填补内容上的空白，重组大型文档集，修复失效的链接，或者只是纠正错别字。举办文档马拉松的目的是为了在相对短的时间内改进大量的文档。

一些产品文档的例子包括：


培训手册

用户手册

安装指南

故障排除指南

快速入门指南

API 文档

教程


在我的组织里，我们的文档团队举办了一次文档马拉松，成功地修改了 102 页的安装指南。这次文档马拉松使我们能够专注于项目的范围，即重新组织简化，删除重复的内容，并遵循客户旅程。举办文档马拉松给我的团队留下了深刻的印象，并提高了客户的成功率。

3 件你可以通过文档马拉松实现的事情

以下是我举办文档马拉松的三大理由：

1、减少积压

大多数文档必须随着它所支持的产品的发展而发展。随着产品的变化或更新，文档也必须如此。在某些情况下，文档团队与工程团队的发布周期一起发布新版本的文档。随着团队内优先级的改变和 GA 发布 的继续，文档团队面临着跟上新功能、错误修复和任务完成的挑战。被遗弃的变化成为积压的一部分，一种需要在以后完成的工作的积累。


提示： 在文档马拉松期间，参与者可以对积压的项目进行分流，并在列表中完成它们。非技术性的参与者可以从事与错别字、失效的链接和其他文本相关问题的修复工作。


2、改造大型指南

当你的文档团队意识到是时候修改指南的时候，它可能已经有好几章，好几百页了。一旦制定了内容计划，重组的复杂性就开始了。重组大量的文档并不适合胆小的人。


提示： 组建一个团队来领导文档马拉松，并为不同团队或部门的全组织参与提供奖励。根据工作范围和时间限制，你的团队可以在比你预期更短的时间内成功重组整个指南。


3、跨职能团队之间的合作

一个组织内的不同小组孤立地工作是很常见的。工程、产品、客户支持、营销和文档团队可能没有像他们应该的那样经常在项目上进行协作。

想象一下，举办一次活动，每个团队成员都可以利用他们的专业知识来改善产品文档。文档马拉松促进了主题专家（SME）的多样性、实时协作和沟通。它们还允许一个包容性的环境，居住在不同地理位置的人可以亲自或远程参与。你的文件会得到具有不同观点和专业的专家的关注，最大限度地减少孤立的孤岛、无意识的偏见和倦怠。


提示： 使跨职能的团队为了一个共同的事业走到一起。


文档马拉松

下一次，当你的团队有一个似乎无法克服的积压工作，或者被赋予重组一个巨大的文档项目的任务时，考虑举办一个文档马拉松。这很容易，而且它的生产力可能会让你吃惊。关于举办这样的活动的更多信息，请阅读 Tiffany Long 写的很棒的 举办黑客马拉松的 10 步指南。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[时隔半年，特斯拉首席执行官埃隆·马斯克（Elon Musk）重新获得了世界首富的头衔。截至周三美股收盘，特斯拉股价涨1.38%，报203.93美元，今年迄今的涨幅已达88.65%。得益于特斯拉股价暴涨，马斯克今年财富增长超过553亿美元。


与此同时，前世界首富Bernard Arnault旗下的奢侈品巨头路威酩轩集团（LVMH）股价周三在巴黎股市下跌2.6%。随着越来越多的迹象显示经济增长放缓，人们对奢侈品行业蓬勃发展的信心开始消退。自4月份以来，LVMH的股价已经下跌了约10%，Arnault的净资产一度在一天之内蒸发了110亿美元。


根据彭博亿万富翁指数（Bloomberg Billionaires Index），马斯克目前的净资产约为1923亿美元，而Arnault的净资产约为1866亿美元。


事实上，马斯克自从2021年9月超越亚马逊创始人贝索斯成为世界首富之后，之后在较长时间内一直占据福布斯富豪榜榜首的位置。


然而，去年由于利率上升抑制了投资者对高风险投资的兴趣，而投资者们担心马斯克在收购推特后过分“分心”也拖累了特斯拉股价，该股暴跌逾65%。


也正因为如此，马斯克去年损失惨重，并于12月份失去了全球首富这一头衔，由Arnault接过代替。


但自新年伊始，投资者对降息即将到来的信心日益增强，以及在全球范围内兴起的AI热潮，都令投资者感到振奋，科技股大获提振，华尔街分析师们也纷纷表示看好。


美国投行Wedbush分析师Dan Ives在一份报告中写道，“总体而言，特斯拉处于有利地位，生成式人工智能应用于其产品套件和商业模式，其将获益匪浅，盈利增长进一步加速。”


“华尔街女股神”木头姐此前更是放出豪言称，在对其特斯拉定价模型进行更新后，预计在基准情境下，特斯拉2027年的每股预期价值将达到2000美元，这相当于当天收盘价的约12倍。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ubuntu 将发布纯 Snap 版的不可变 Linux

近些年不可变操作系统的概念开始流行，这种操作系统不能被用户或应用程序直接修改，采用原子式更新，应用通过容器化与操作系统隔离。一些流行的不可变操作系统有 Chrome OS、Fedora Silverblue 等。Canonical 计划将下一个 Ubuntu LTS 分为两个版本，除了传统版本外，还将有一个不可变的桌面操作系统版本。它基于其用于物联网环境的 Ubuntu Core，并且全部采用 Snap 来封装桌面应用以提供不可变性和更新需求的之间的平衡。


消息来源：Ubuntu



老王点评：听起来不错，对于那些需要不可变系统的人来说值得关注。不过，Snap 有多少指责，Canonical 不知道吗？如果不解决好了就推这种纯 Snap 版本，我恐怕它会陷入败局。




数百万技嘉主板出厂时内置不安全的后门

安全研究人员发现，技嘉出售的主板固件含有一个隐藏的机制。每当计算机重启时，固件代码会启动一个更新程序，然后下载和执行另一个软件，以保持主板固件更新。但技嘉的更新机制没有正确验证就下载代码到用户计算机上，部分情况下甚至是通过 HTTP 而不是 HTTPS 下载的，这容易遭到中间人攻击。受到影响的技嘉主板多达 271 个型号，其数量数以百万计。技嘉已经表示它计划修复研究人员发现的问题。


消息来源：Wired



老王点评：即便发布了新修复的固件，但是绝大部分人都不会主动去更新固件，也就是说，这个漏洞带来的影响可能很久都难以消除。只能说，有些产品设计人员还处在“隐秘就是安全”的远古思维。




Brave 浏览器用户每天为其添加数以百万计的新网页

Brave 声称，其独立的 Brave 搜索引擎现在提供超过每年 80 亿次的查询，这使其成为自微软必应以来增长最快的搜索引擎。另外，Brave 浏览器用户可选加入的 “网络发现项目” 为其提供了动力，该项目每天向 Brave 搜索引擎添加数以百万计的新网页，使其保持更新。Brave 网络浏览器现在有超过 6000 万活跃用户。


消息来源：Thurrott



老王点评：这样看起来浏览器和搜索引擎真是天作之合啊，通过用户的浏览行为来为搜索引擎提供索引建议，要比网络爬虫漫无目的的爬取更有质量。]]></summary>

To me, it feels like Linux on phones is essentially doomed to be beta/developer software a very long time and not really usable for a majority of people unless they can live without Android/iOS exclusive apps or are ok with running Android apps in containers which way not completely work. I feel like it is because of the following reasons :
 The Fragmentation
 Yes, yes, Android is not the most unified OS too. Android suffers from a very major update problem too (on third-party OEMs). But there is one way where Android fragmentation isn't too bad - App Compatibility. An app packaged up as a .apk can be installed on Stock Android on the Google Pixels or on Samsung, Xiaomi, Oppo and more Android skins or versions, and it will probably work properly…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[6 月 1 日，阿里云宣布通义大模型进展，聚焦音视频内容的 AI 新品“通义听悟”正式上线，成为国内首个开放公测的大模型应用产品。




通义听悟接入了通义千问大模型的理解与摘要能力，可成为用户工作学习中的得力 AI 助手，帮助随时随地高效完成对音视频内容的转写、检索、摘要和整理，比如用大模型自动做笔记、整理访谈、提取 PPT 等。公测期间，用户可领取 100 小时以上听悟免费转写时长。

“换一种方式，让音视频可以被轻松阅读、整理和分享。”阿里云 CTO 周靖人介绍，听悟是一款工作学习 AI 助手，它瞄准具有高知识附加值的音视频内容场景，比如开会、上课、访谈、培训、面试、直播、看视频、听播客等，能通过大模型等最新 AI 技术快速提炼和沉淀知识。 



根据现场演示，听悟融合了十多项 AI 功能，可以全面提升知识从音视频向图文形态转化的效率。除了“听力好”，能高准确度生成会议记录、区分不同发言人，这个 AI 助手“悟性也极高”，大模型可以一秒给音视频划分章节并形成摘要、总结全文及每个发言人观点、整理关注重点和待办事项。大模型一键提取 PPT、针对多个音视频内容向 AI 提问、概括特定段落等功能近期也将上线。



通义听悟可自动为音视频生成全文摘要、章节概括、发言总结

针对一些细分场景，听悟还设置了不少“宝藏功能”：打开 Chrome 插件，外语学习者和听障人士可以借助双语悬浮字幕条随时随地看无字幕视频，日程冲突时，听悟还可成为职场人士的“开会替身”，在静音情况下入会 AI 可代为记录会议、整理要点；转写结果可下载为字幕文件，方便新媒体从业者视频后期制作；听悟梳理的问答回顾可以让记者、分析师、律师、HR 等群体整理访谈更高效。



通义听悟 Chrome 插件将在近期对所有用户开放下载

另一显著优势是，听悟与阿里云盘打通，一键就能转写云盘上的音视频内容，公测期间注册的听悟用户后续还将获得更大的阿里云盘存储空间，在云盘内在线播放视频时也可自动出字幕。



通义听悟支持一键导入阿里云盘音视频文件

周靖人介绍，听悟集成了阿里最先进的语音和语言技术。其内置阿里新一代工业级语音识别模型，识别准确率在多个权威中文数据集上名列第一；融合自研语音语义多模态说话人算法，能对 10 人以上说话场景进行角色区分；接入通义千问大模型后，能够对上万字的音视频内容进行摘要总结，事实准确与要点完备性国内领先，支持跨多音视频内容的精准问答理解。

继史无前例的大降价后，阿里云再次送出人人都能用上的 AI “大礼包”。此前国内语音厂商 AI 转写定价达 19.8 元每小时，而听悟用户可通过每日登陆等多种任务领取免费转写时长。公测期间，阿里云官方微博、微信及各大平台社区还会发放大量 20 小时转写口令码，用户获得的福利权益可累加，一年内有效，免费时长可高达 100 小时以上，市场价值上千元。

据了解，听悟除个人版本外，还有企业应用。此前，听悟企业版已在阿里集团内部被广泛使用，帮助减少了大量会议记录和整理的工作，受到好评。同时，听悟的能力也可嵌进各类音视频平台，形成实时字幕、智能摘要等，典型应用如钉钉的“钉闪记”背后便集成了听悟。未来听悟还将在夸克 APP、阿里云盘等端口提供服务。

古典考古学者尼夏·马克·斯维尼（Naoíse Mac Sweeney）在她的新书《西方：旧观念的新历史》（The West: A New History of an Old Idea）中，通过对十四位历史人物的生涯及其著作的记述，挑战并再阐释了“西方文明”这个已经存在了两千五百年的概念。这十四人从公元前五世纪伟大的希腊历史学家希罗多德开始，到二十一世纪的前香港特首林郑月娥，她是香港最近“由乱至治”进程中的主导人物。
听到这个你会觉得有趣吗？坦率地说，我很怀疑。我们都知道出版商喜欢这种铺张的场景，但很容易想象，这本书可能会变成二手知识和温吞水陈词滥调的混合体。
雪上加霜的是，她的前提几乎没有原创性，马克·斯维尼也直接承认了这一点。在人们的理解中，西方文明的历史，从柏拉图到北约，是卓越思想和实践的一种结合（自由！民主！言论自由！），源于古希腊，此后被提炼、延伸，并随着时代的发展（经历了文艺复兴、科学革命和其他据称西方独有的发展阶段）而传播，所以我们今天所在的西方是某种卓越文化DNA的幸运继承者。
这种提法非常有力，因此毫不奇怪，它在美国总是特别受欢迎——因为与种族灭绝、种族清洗、大规模种族奴役和生态破坏相比，这种将你的国族历史联系起来的叙述更令人振奋。但在学术界，“西方文明”已不再是一个被认真对待的概念。相反，现在有大量的文献在解构“西方”这个概念是如何在不同的时间和地点被发明、引导并使用的——往往是以我们自己会觉得非常令人厌恶的方式。
在这本书中，麦克·斯维尼向普通读者解释这一切为何如此——以及这种立论为何会如此发生。她一定是一位了不起的教师，同时也是富有才华的作家，因为这项颇具挑战性的任务被漂…]]></summary>

到了人工智能的文本与图像生成能力眼看就要攻陷知识人最后坚守的信念堡垒的今天，恐怕已经没有多少人会对历史叙事的生成背后的所谓客观性深信不疑了，“历史由胜利者书写”以及被遮蔽的“沉默的历史”等论述也早已成了老生常谈。然而关于“历史”究竟是如何被权力生产出来的疑问远未解决，虽然权力与历史书写的关系也早已被谈论，近日在网上流传罗新教授关于“政治强权对历史论述的独占”的精彩论述（节选自他的著作《有所不为的反叛者》）也引起了反响，但是对于“独占”过程中的手段、性质及复杂的细节等问题仍然有必要展开深入的讨论。更不用说当人们越来越意识到必须把世界发展的未来与过去及现在联系起来思考的时候，显然更需要把“历史”这个文本的权力生产真相认识清楚。历史学家帕特里克·格里（Patrick J. Geary）指出，作为民族主义意识形态工具的现代史学“将我们对过去的理解变成了一个有毒的垃圾场，里面充满了族群民族主义的毒气，而且，这种毒气已经渗透进大众的意识中”（帕特里克·格里《民族的神话——欧洲的中世纪起源》，吕昭等译，广西师大出版社，2022年，第1页）。我们无论如何不应低估这种充满毒性的、固化的历史认知对开创未来生活的严重阻碍。格里还曾经在一次研讨会上说：“所有的历史学问题都不是清白无辜的，他们都有自己的分子生物学传承谱系。”历史学问题的“清白无辜”与否，主要指的就是历史生产的真实语境的复杂性和利益动机，而所谓“分子生物学传承谱系”实际上指的是权力的传承谱系。
在这个意义上，美国人类学家米歇尔-罗尔夫·特鲁约（Michel-Rolph Trouillot，1949-2012）的《沉默的过去：权力与历史生产》（原书名Silencing the Past：Power and th…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[以下是如何使用 OpenAI ChatGPT AI 创建聊天助手的 Python 程序的方法。


易于使用的 AI “ChatGPT” 已经以 API 提供。ChatGPT 的创造者 OpenAI 宣布，模型（'gpt-3.5-turbo'）现在适用于自定义产品和解决方案。而且成本也非常实惠。目前的价格为每 1000 个令牌 0.002 美元。

该模型目前与 Whisper API 一起提供，后者也用于文本到语音解决方案。该 API 目前具备以下功能：


创建自定义的对话代理和机器人

为你编写 Python 代码

起草电子邮件或任何你想要的文档

你可以将自然语言界面集成到你当前的产品/应用/服务或软件中，为你的消费者提供服务

语言翻译服务

成为许多科目的导师

模拟视频游戏角色


正如你所见，机会无限。

如果你计划尝试该 API 并开始使用它，这里有一个简单的指南，为你提供逐步指导。

OpenAI ChatGPT API: 入门指南

先决条件

确保你拥有一个 OpenAI 账户。如果你没有，访问此页面 并创建一个账户。你也可以使用你的谷歌或微软账号。

创建一个账户后，生成一个专属于你的 API 密钥。访问 此页面 并创建一个新的秘密密钥。



记录该密钥或在安全的地方保存它。基于安全原因，它将不会从 OpenAI 账户部分再次可见。而且不要与任何人分享此密钥。如果你计划使用企业解决方案，请向你的组织查询 API 密钥。由于该密钥与你的付费 OpenAI 计划相关，因此请谨慎使用。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I hope this doesn't count as a support question. I'm trying to gather information about studying for an LPIC-1. I have some books that I picked up. Been looking through those and it seems to require skill with apt and rpm based distros but so far the books haven't narrowed it down much beyond that. I've been using Linux for nearly 20 years as an end user but haven't done a lot of admin work. Just some simple jobs here and there. The goal is to cash in on all that experience I picked up and get off of disability. I've chosen LPIC-1 as a first stop in a series of certification I want to get. Any pointers at all for studying would be greatly appreciated.

Out of the box experience:
  
 I like their customized GNOME. It's fresh, it's not a copy of Windows layout, but it's also more intuitive than vanilla for new users coming from Windows. E.g. - a lot of users are used to system tray and functionality which is not in stock GNOME. They also added accent colors.
 Unlike Fedora and OpenSUSE, it doesn't need bunch of commands for codecs and hardware acceleration. Recently, on Fedora there was some conflicts with mesa-freeword which resulted in borked systems. …]]></summary>

	GCC 13's -fanalyzer option now keeps track of the sizes of

根据我的经验，开源的 开放决策框架Open Decision Framework 可以克服许多这样的障碍。

开放决策框架宣称，开放式决策 是透明的、包容的、以客户为中心的。它包括与受影响的各方清楚地分享问题、要求和限制。它能够与多个利益相关者合作，以确保不同的意见和全面的反馈。最重要的是，它能在相互竞争的需求和优先事项之间管理关系和期望。

这些原则可能会引起任何参与设计产品、功能或服务的决策的人的共鸣。对于一个设计师来说，开发人员是做出最佳设计决策的关键利益相关者。如果你是一个设计师，现在是时候接受获得不同意见的机会了。

后台和用户体验

开发人员是关键的利益相关者，因为用户的产品或服务体验不仅仅是屏幕上的像素或工作流程的设计。它包含了服务的性能、API 调用的速度、处理用户数据的方式，甚至是数据的可扩展性设计。当他们被认为是设计中的完全利益相关者时，开发者可以贡献他们在服务的后端和架构方面的专业知识，以协助整体的体验设计。

用户体验（UX）设计师是开发团队所负责的项目的利益相关者。性能上的不足，或者架构对可用数据的影响，都会阻碍用户体验。一个开放的、开发和设计之间的合作关系 允许在所有领域的信任和透明。

为合作留出空间

开发者和设计之间的开放和透明的关系并不像它应该的那样普遍。这种工作方式对双方来说可能都是新的。以下是我为使合作成功而提出的五大建议：


建立一个经常性的合作时间：为设计和开发建立一个经常性的时间，在每周到每月一次之间进行会面。邀请的对象至少应该包括 UX、主导工程和质量工程。理想情况下，如果日程安排允许，团队中的所有开发人员都应该被邀请参加。

使分享成为主要议程： UX 应该分享他们目前正在进行的用例和功能，以及任何相关的用户研究数据。UX 设计师应该向开发团队展示工作流程设计、线框图和高保真模拟图。开发应该分享他们这边做出的任何可能影响用户体验的设计决定。

鼓励提问： 合作是最理想的情况。鼓励所有与会者提出问题并给予反馈。对问题的回答和对反馈的回应是讨论设计和方向的机会，也是一个相互学习的机会。

拥抱学习的心态：避免说教或“告诉”。相反，目的是互相学习。利用彼此的专业知识，为用户和客户设计和建立一个良好的体验。要求对不熟悉的技术或概念进行解释。

考虑正式学习：当群体说着相同的语言时，合作关系会更容易。考虑正式的学习途径，例如：

设计人员：编码基础课程，如开源的 Odin 项目，对于学习服务的构造和构建的基本原理是有帮助的。

开发人员：对 UX 原则的理解可以帮助指导问题和反馈。你可以在 UX 设计原则或各种书籍和文章中找到一个很好的概述。




一个开放合作的例子

在与我团队中的一个开发人员进行的早期设计审查中，我展示了一个具体的交互，以显示关于一个物体的更多数据。我传达了用户的需求并演示了这个交互，这时开发者问道：“是否需要完全以这种方式来完成？”

他提到，只要在设计上稍加改动，开发的工作量就会大大降低。我们同意，这些改变不会对用户体验产生负面影响，而且用户仍然能够实现他们的目标。

这种反馈节省了开发团队的时间，留下了更多的机会来解决错误，建立额外的功能，并保持健康的工作和生活的平衡。用户体验依然强劲，而团队则更加强大。如果没有一个与我有深厚工作关系的开发者的早期反馈，这个结果是不可能的。

你的下一步

建立体验是由一个合作的团队做出的一系列决定。产品、设计和开发需要作为各自领域的专家和其他人的利益相关者一起工作。我鼓励你让开发和设计参与进来，以获得更多的合作反馈，并一起努力创造出具有最佳用户体验的最佳产品。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I bought an HP 15-e2000 just to put a Linux on because I love Arch, but I've been on Windows for a long time now because my main PC is a gaming/VR/HTPC rig with a variety of uses that require or at least strongly prefer/have a better feature set on Windows. 
 Unfortunately there's some extremely long-standing (nine years now?) bug with these specific speakers that leaves me with no sound on every distro I've tried (Arch, Endeavor, Manjaro, Mint, Pop). I'm just left with "dummy output". The worst part is, a) it always works fine in the live environment, and there were several times on Endeavor where I'd turn it off and back on and the audio would suddenly work, so it feels like there's some obvious answer just slightly out of my grasp, but I can't figure it out, and now I have this laptop I don't really need that I can't use in the way I want and it sssssuuuuucccckkkkssss.
 Doubly unfortunately it's the only one at its price point with as nice a hardware feature set as this, so if I return it for a more Linux compatible one I'll be shelling out another $300 or so just to match this.
 God damn you, Windows. You've won yet again 🤬

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[据北京市市场监督管理局消息，日前，苹果电子产品商贸(北京)有限公司因发布虚假广告被北京市东城区市场监督管理局处以20万元的行政处罚。


处罚信息显示，2022年2月14日，执法人员依据举报线索浏览当事人上述网站，发现其通过上述网站为其销售的Macbook Air产品广告使用了“8核中央处理器、干活够爽快，用电省得狠。”“M1芯片拥有我们迄今打造的最快的中央处理器。”等内容，并在页面右上角有“广告”字样。


经调查，上述页面为当事人为所售的MacbookAir笔记本发布的商业广告。MacbookAir笔记本搭载的M1芯片配备8核中央处理器，包括四个高性能核心和四个高效能核心。2021年10月，苹果公司推出了配备M1Pro和M1Max芯片的MacBookPro。M1Pro和M1Max芯片搭载的是由8颗高性能核心和2颗高效率核心组成的全新10核中央处理器，运行速度相比M1提升最高可达70%。


综上，案发时M1芯片配备的中央处理器并非为苹果公司打造的最快的。你单位在配备M1芯片的MacbookAir和配备M1Pro和M1Max芯片的MacBookPro同时销售的情况下，在MacbookAir产品广告中宣称其搭载的M1芯片“拥有我们迄今打造的最快的中央处理器。”内容与事实不符。上述广告内容由当事人自行编辑制作及上传发布，广告费用无法核算。


依据《中华人民共和国广告法》(2018)第五十五条第一款，北京市东城区市场监督管理局责令当事人改正上述违法行为，停止发布上述广告，在相应范围内消除影响，并处罚款20万元。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Official Wikipedia Page states that usage of Linux computers as of April, 2022 was only 2.48%. But we know that these figures can't be realistic, right? There are many reasons for this:
  
Linux is a privacy friendly OS and the defaults in most distros won't allow any telemetry or data collection unless explicitly approved - and let's face it, most people won't explicitly approve it because otherwise they wouldn't be using Linux in the first place! Privacy and Freedom are like numero uno reason why people use Linux.
 How did they track this 2.48% figure? I'm guessing they took it from download stats of popular distros like Ubuntu, Mint, Debian, etc. or did they source it from Distrowatch or something? These are all still very conservative estimates because the way Linux community is spread so wide and distributed that it's difficult to track all installs. For example, many Universities and NGOs across the world act as mirrors for hosting Linux ISOs and students studying in those Universities might be directly sourcing the ISOs from there instead of going to the Ubuntu or Debian home page? There is also the case that many Linux enthusiasts source the distros through torrenting and those won't be counted.
  
In fact, the same wikipedia page then quotes a StackOverflow survey where developers are explicitly asked which OS they use. Even this share is still smaller than windows but to me, this seems like a more reasonable estimate of Linux's true market share:
  
Windows: 45.3%
 macOS: 29.2%
 Linux: 25.3%
 BSD/Unix: 0.1%
  
If possible, I want you to do a quick anecdotal exercise. Try to count on your fingers the number of your own friends and acquaintances who use Windows and Linux and then compute their share. I have a feeling that figure will match closely to the StackOverflow survey results above!

继两年前 Rust 审核团队宣布立即辞职后，Rust 项目的管理就一直处于跛脚运行之中。最近，Rust 项目又卷入了 RustConf 主题演讲争议。RustConf 2023 主动邀请了 JeanHeyd Meneide 发表主题演讲，他是 C 语言官方标准的两位编辑之一，管理着许多重要的大型开源项目。但在他花费了大量时间准备了演讲《编译时编程（可能）的未来》后，Rustconf 以其演讲“不被 Rust 项目认可”，担心该演讲被认为是官方方向的理由，而通知他将主题演讲降为普通演讲。但实际原因被推测为他曾经分享过一些认为 Rust 应该反思的内容，Rust 管理层内有人反感他。他认为这是一次侮辱，随即 宣布 拒绝出席 RustConf。此事还导致推荐他发表演讲的 Rust 核心成员愤而辞职。在此事冲上热搜后，Rust 项目发表 声明 对此事公开道歉，称它的决策和沟通流程出现了问题，开始启动两年来迟迟未决的新的治理委员会。


消息来源：The PHD



老王点评：一个成功的开源项目，需要广泛的社区决策，也需要一个定海神针般的领袖人物，Linux 如此、Python 如此。而 Rust 社区却没有一个灵魂人物，我们只能看到各种内部斗争和自行其是，这样的风格，即便成立治理委员会，我认为也很难说有未来。

ChatGPT 为律师编写的法庭文件杜撰了六个不存在的案例

尽管我们知道人工智能会煞有介事的杜撰一些“事实”，但是一位律师在使用 ChatGPT 帮助编写法庭文件时，AI 居然杜撰了六个不存在的案例，并且还信誓旦旦地给出了法律来源，保证了其可靠性。律师表示，没有确认 ChatGPT 提供的来源是他的错。法官称这是“前所未有的”，并考虑对该律师进行惩罚。

老王点评：在 AI 出错时，你对它提出的批评它往往会听从。但如果你指出它的“事实性”错误时，它往往是嘴硬的，所以你还是得依靠“古典的”搜索引擎来确认事实。]]></summary>

2020年11月16日凌晨，在日本东京涩谷附近的公交车站，一位名叫大林三佐子的六十四岁女性被人打死。真相很快查明：这位女性是一名无家可归者，以打短工为生，去世时口袋里只有八日元——这或许便是她只能在公交车站过夜的原因。而凶手吉田和人是住在附近的一名独居中年男子，靠出租父母留下来的房屋过活。他对自己居住区域周边的“卫生”极为偏执，经常因住所附近的垃圾杂物问题与邻人起争执，而大林三佐子当晚栖身的公交车站恰好在他家窗户的视线范围之内。于是在那个深秋的夜晚，吉田和人意欲驱赶大林三佐子，后者不从——结果惨剧发生。
这一事件很快引起人们关注。拜现代新闻业与传媒技术所赐，很快有记者挖掘出死者生平信息，而旁观者们也纷纷通过各种渠道了解到这个女人平凡但不断下落的人生，以及她年轻时的照片——自然，这样直接的图像信息很容易带来共情冲击，“她就是我”的评论很快出现在各类社交平台之上。日本广播协会（NHK）很快制作了讲述大林三佐子青春时代的纪录片，随后导演高桥伴明基于这一事件拍摄了电影《在公交车站直到黎明》，令这一事件受到新一轮关注。
大林三佐子无疑是不幸的，但比起历史上太多无名的不幸者，她又多少有一丝幸运——至少，她的故事没有彻底隐入尘烟，更没有因为记录的缺位而沦为传说的背景。然而1888年在伦敦白教堂附近接连横尸街头的五名女子则没有这样的“幸运”——尽管官方记录中有她们的名字，但对于大多数人而言，她们只是连环杀手“开膛手杰克”的陪衬，是五个微不足道的“妓女”。
英国历史学家海莉·鲁本霍德的《生而为女》（原作名“The Five”，下文未标注书名之引用皆出自中译本）正是为填补这一空白而写。“我之所以提起笔，是希望如今的我们现在可以听清她们的故事，并将那些一度从她们生命中被残酷夺走的…]]></summary>

An immutable version exists since 2015, called UbuntuCore... there will be a desktop release of it with the next LTS (optional though, the classic desktop install will indeed not go away)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[清遗民群体中，夏孙桐（1857-1942）不是特别耀眼的一位。就创造性或争议性而言，他有些淡乎寡味，在近代学术史、思想史、政治史领域似乎都谈不上影响或面目。可查的惟一一篇以他为题的研究生学位论文，是研究他的诗词的，就中更偏重于他的词作与词学，反映了他的影响所在（参见方慧勤《夏孙桐诗词研究》，苏州大学2012年硕士论文）。不过，他晚年处于伪华北政务委员会的“统治”之下，与伪满小朝廷、汪伪政权人物及日本人有互动、来往，一方面有意识地开启对近代史的“默省”，另一方面又努力面对自己的道德困境，做出回应。以历史的后见之明与夏孙桐的知识结构来看，其“默省”也许并无大过人处，但“默省”意识的存在，使他更深切地感受到自己的“位置”及其“张力”。这是我们感兴趣的。

夏孙桐

夏孙桐官至杭州知府，但1938年他对自己的定位是“也署先朝旧史官”（《自题花之寺看海棠图》，《观所尚斋诗存》卷二，民国二十八年铅印本）。追溯起来，他在翰林院编修任上时，就与修国史会典。清室逊政后，他参与编纂了《清史稿》及徐世昌主编的《大清畿辅先哲传》《晚晴簃诗汇》《清儒学案》，还参与了《续修四库全书总目提要》的撰写。像他这样同时参与了五种大工程的，并不多见，显示了他在传统目录学、史学上的造诣与名声。他在诸老间颇有资望，曾为缪荃孙、叶昌炽、陈曾寿、冯幵、郭则沄、关赓麟、赵椿年、张仲炘、汪曾武、黄公渚等人的编著题耑（详见夏武康、夏志兰整理《闰庵公遗墨辑录》，2004年自印本，17-38页）。1938年秋，傅增湘藏园举行“蓬山话旧”第五集（前清进士雅集）时，他是最年长的一位。基本上，他目睹了中法战争以来的所有军国大事，尽管从未置身于事件的中心。最接近的一次要数庚子事变，1900年秋冬，他奔赴西安“行在”，然而也远离事变的中心北京。他作为清遗民或清遗臣，处在类似的行列。他从未出任、也未谋求过民国政府的官职（供职清史馆应当作…]]></summary>

2023 Linux Storage, Filesystem,
Memory-Management and BPF Summit on work they have been doing to
implement atomic block writes of various sizes for SCSI and NVMe. 
The idea is to support devices that can guarantee atomic operations for
sizes larger than their block size.
 It is
an attempt to "find 
common ground" between the two standards, Petersen said, because the two
have slightly different semantics, depending on the device type, and
different restrictions, which has made for an "interesting project". It has
been a challenge to find an abstraction layer that can work with the "five
different variants 
of SCSI and NVMe implementations that may or may not be out there".]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[5月30日消息，350位AI行业的高管、研究人员和工程师日前签署了一封公开信，表示担忧AI技术将对人类带来生存威胁。这封信由位于非营利组织人工智能安全中心发布，其中仅有一句话：“降低人工智能带来的灭绝风险应该成为一个全球优先事项，与大流行病、核战争等其他社会规模的风险并列。”


OpenAI首席执行官Sam Altman、Google DeepMind首席执行官Demis Hassabis、Anthropic首席执行官Dario Amodei三位 AI公司高管，以及2018年图灵奖得主Geoffrey Hinton、Yoshua Bengio已签署这封信。


自ChatGPT掀起AI热潮以来，对这项技术潜在风险的担忧持续增加。此次公开信引发了广泛关注和热议，也使得人们对 AI技术的发展和应用有了更加深入的思考与探讨。


这份声明由总部位于旧金山的非营利组织人工智能安全中心发布，他们认为AI对人类构成生存威胁，所以发出了新的警告。整份声明仅有一句话，全部内容如下：



“降低人工智能带来的灭绝风险应该成为一个全球优先事项，与大流行病、核战争等其他社会规模的风险并列。” 






此前，马斯克联合超过千名产业界和学术界的大佬们，在“生命未来研究所（Future of Life Institute）”网站上发布联名公告。公开信中主要传达了两个方面的信息：一是警告人工智能存在对人类社会的潜在威胁，要求立刻暂停任何比GPT-4更强大的人工智能系统的训练，时间跨度至少6个月。二是呼吁整个人工智能领域以及政策制定者们，要共同设计一套全面的人工智能治理系统，对人工智能技术的发展进行监督和审查。]]></summary>

非营利组织“人工智能安全中心Center for AI Safety”预计将发布一份只有一句话的声明：“减轻人工智能带来的灭绝风险应与其他社会规模的风险，如大流行病和核战争一样，成为全球优先事项。”这封公开信由 350 多名从事人工智能工作的高管、研究人员和工程师签署，签署者包括三家领先的人工智能公司 OpenAI、谷歌 DeepMind 和Anthropic 的 CEO，也包括除了 Yann LeCun 之外的人工智能领域另外两位图灵奖得主。

老王点评：这个时候，我们应该相信他们真的放出来一只不得了的巨兽。但是我觉得，倡议是徒劳的，或许能引起全社会的关注，但是如果没有切实的利益机制制约，早晚会无可遏制。




人工智能意味着每个人现在都可以成为程序员

在台北举行的 Computex 论坛上，英伟达 CEO 黄仁勋对数千人说，人工智能正在引领一场计算革命。他在演讲中说：“毫无疑问，我们正处于一个新的计算时代”。他表示，人工智能意味着每个人现在都可以成为计算机程序员，因为他们需要做的只是与计算机对话，并为 “数字鸿沟” 的结束欢呼。


消息来源：路透社



老王点评：程序员可能就会像以前的手工业者们一样，绝大部分都会消失，只在偏僻的角度零星留下几个来修复一些遗留系统。




英特尔将在其最新 CPU 中加入人工智能处理芯片

英特尔称，将在其即将推出的第 14 代酷睿处理器 Meteor Lake CPU 的所有型号中加入 “视觉处理单元” VPU。如今，CPU 和 GPU 承担着繁重的工作，但它们将被人工智能工作负载的需求所淹没。将这些工作转移到云端是昂贵的，也是不切实际的，因为买家希望个人电脑有良好的性能，因此，VPU 将作为一种 SoC 出现在 CPU 中。CPU 仍将被要求做低延迟的简单推理工作，GPU 将被用来做涉及并行和吞吐量的工作，而其他与人工智能相关的工作将被卸载到 VPU 上。


消息来源：The Register



老王点评：整个世界仍像一辆没有刹车的卡车，奔向了人工智能的未来。

apologizing for and explaining its role in the event, describing its

of the failure.


	Organizationally, within leadership chat we will enforce a strict

	ambiguity of whether something is an individual opinion or a group

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[清遗民群体中，夏孙桐（1857-1942）不是特别耀眼的一位。就创造性或争议性而言，他有些淡乎寡味，在近代学术史、思想史、政治史领域似乎都谈不上影响或面目。可查的惟一一篇以他为题的研究生学位论文，是研究他的诗词的，就中更偏重于他的词作与词学，反映了他的影响所在（参见方慧勤《夏孙桐诗词研究》，苏州大学2012年硕士论文）。不过，他晚年处于伪华北政务委员会的“统治”之下，与伪满小朝廷、汪伪政权人物及日本人有互动、来往，一方面有意识地开启对近代史的“默省”，另一方面又努力面对自己的道德困境，做出回应。以历史的后见之明与夏孙桐的知识结构来看，其“默省”也许并无大过人处，但“默省”意识的存在，使他更深切地感受到自己的“位置”及其“张力”。这是我们感兴趣的。

夏孙桐

一
夏孙桐官至杭州知府，但1938年他对自己的定位是“也署先朝旧史官”（《自题花之寺看海棠图》，《观所尚斋诗存》卷二，民国二十八年铅印本）。追溯起来，他在翰林院编修任上时，就与修国史会典。清室逊政后，他参与编纂了《清史稿》及徐世昌主编的《大清畿辅先哲传》《晚晴簃诗汇》《清儒学案》，还参与了《续修四库全书总目提要》的撰写。像他这样同时参与了五种大工程的，并不多见，显示了他在传统目录学、史学上的造诣与名声。他在诸老间颇有资望，曾为缪荃孙、叶昌炽、陈曾寿、冯幵、郭则沄、关赓麟、赵椿年、张仲炘、汪曾武、黄公渚等人的编著题耑（详见夏武康、夏志兰整理《闰庵公遗墨辑录》，2004年自印本，17-38页）。1938年秋，傅增湘藏园举行“蓬山话旧”第五集（前清进士雅集）时，他是最年长的一位。基本上，他目睹了中法战争以来的所有军国大事，尽管从未置身于事件的中心。最接近的一次要数庚子事变，1900年秋冬，他奔赴西安“行在”，然而也远离事变的中心北京。他作为清遗民或清遗臣，处在类似的行列。他从未出任、也未谋求过民国政府的官职（供职清史馆应当作…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[我正在制作一份有关计算机以二进制表示事物的小册子，有人问我一个问题 - 为什么 x86 架构使用 8 位字节？为什么不能是其他大小呢？

对于类似这样的问题，我认为有两种可能性：


这是历史原因造成的，其他尺寸（如 4、6 或 16 位）同样有效。

8 位是客观上的最佳选择，即使历史发展不同，我们仍然会使用 8 位字节。

一些混合 1 和 2 的因素。


我对计算机历史并不是非常着迷（与阅读计算机文献相比，我更喜欢使用计算机），但我总是很好奇计算机事物今天的方式是否存在本质原因，或者它们大多是历史偶然的结果。因此，我们将谈论一些计算机历史。

作为历史偶然性的一个例子：DNS 有一个 class 字段，它有 5 种可能的值（internet、chaos、hesiod、none 和 any）。 对我来说，这是一个明显的历史意外的例子 - 如果我们今天重新设计 DNS 而不必担心向后兼容性，我无法想象我们会以相同的方式定义类字段。我不确定我们是否会使用 class 字段！

这篇文章没有明确的答案，但我在 Mastodon 上提问，并找到了一些潜在的 8 位字节原因。我认为答案是这些原因的某种组合。

字节和字有什么区别？

首先，本文中经常提到 “字节byte” 和 “字word”。它们有什么区别？我的理解是：


字节的大小 是你可以寻址的最小单元。例如，在我的计算机上，程序中的 0x20aa87c68 可能是一个字节的地址，然后 0x20aa87c69 是下一个字节的地址。

字的大小 是字节大小的某个倍数。我对此困惑了多年，维基百科的定义非常模糊（“字是特定处理器设计使用的自然数据单元”）。我最初认为字大小与寄存器大小相同（在 x86-64 上为 64 位）。但是根据 英特尔架构手册 的第 4.1 节（“基本数据类型”），在 x86 …]]></summary>

在前面的文章中，我已经解释了为什么将编程问题看作一整群丧尸来处理是错误的。我用 ZOMBIES 方法来解释为什么循序渐进地处理问题更好。

ZOMBIES 表示以下首字母缩写：


Z – 最简场景（Zero）

O – 单元素场景（One）

M – 多元素场景（Many or more complex）

B – 边界行为（Boundary behaviors）

I – 接口定义（Interface definition）

E – 处理特殊行为（Exercise exceptional behavior）

S – 简单场景用简单的解决方案（Simple scenarios, simple solutions）


在系列的前三篇文章中，我展示了 ZOMBIES 方法的前五项。第一篇中 实现了最简场景，它为代码提供了最简可行路径。第二篇文章中执行了 单元素场景和多元素场景上的测试。第三篇中介绍了 边界和接口。在本文中，我将带你了解倒数第二个方法：处理特殊行为。

处理特殊行为

在开发一个电子购物应用时，你需要从产品负责人或赞助商那里了解需要采用什么销售策略。

毫无疑问，与任何电子商业活动一样，你需要通过制定销售策略来诱导顾客进行消费。假设有如下的销售策略：订单金额超过 ￥500 时可以享受一定的折扣优惠。

现在将这个销售策略转换为可运行期望：

丧尸没有边界感。它们踩倒栅栏，推倒围墙，进入不属于它们的地盘。在前面的文章中，我已经解释了为什么把所有编程问题当作一群丧尸一次性处理是错误的。

Z – 最简场景（Zero）

回到单元素场景

要想处理边界，你需要绕回来（迭代）。

首先思考下面的问题：电子商务的边界是什么？我需要限制购物框的大小吗？（事实上，我不认为这有任何意义。）

目前唯一合理的边界条件是确保购物框里的商品数量不能为负数。将这个限制表示成可运行的期望：

        <link href="https://linux.cn/article-15858-1.html?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss"/>
        <updated>2023-05-30T01:03:05.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[在遇到合并冲突时，请不要惊慌。通过一些娴熟的技巧协商，你可以解决任何冲突。


假设你和我正在共同编辑同一个名称为 index.html 的文件。我对文件进行了修改，进行了提交，并将更改推送到 Git 远程仓库。你也对同一个文件进行了修改，进行了提交，并开始将更改推送到同一个 Git 仓库。然而，Git 检测到一个冲突，因为你所做的更改与我所做的更改冲突。

以下是你可以解决冲突的方法：

1、从远程仓库获取并合并最新更改：

$ git pull


2、识别一个或多个有冲突的文件：

$ git status


3、使用文本编辑器打开冲突文件：

$ vim index.html


4、解决冲突。冲突的修改会被标记为 <<<<<<< HEAD 和 >>>>>>>。你需要选择要保留和放弃哪些修改，并手动编辑文件以合并冲突的修改。

以下是一个示例：

<<<<<<< HEAD
<div class="header">
<h1>Sample text 1</h1>
</div>
=======
<div class="header">
<h1>Sample text 2</h1>
</div>
>>>>>>> feature-branch


在这个例子中，我将网站标题更改为 Sample text 1，而你将标题更改为 Sample text 2。两种更改都已添加到文件中。现在你可以决定保留哪一个标题，或者编辑文件以合并更改。在任一情况下，删除指示更改开始和结束的标记，只留下你想要的代码：

<div class="header">
<h1>Sample text 2</h1>
</div>


5、保存所有更改，并关闭编辑器。

6、将文件添加到暂存区：

$ git add index.html


7、提交更改：

$ git commit -m "Updated h1 in index.html"


此命令使用消息 Resolved merge conflict 提交更改。

8、将更改推送到远程仓库：

$ git push


结论

合并冲突是将注意力集中于代码的好理由。你在文件中进行的更改越多，就越容易产生冲突。你应该进行更多的提交，每个提交更改应该更少。你应该避免进行包含多个特性增强或错误修复的单片巨大更改。你的项目经理也会感谢你，因为具有清晰意图的提交更容易追踪。在最初遇到 Git 合并冲突时可能会感到吓人，但是现在你知道如何解决它，你会发现它很容易解决。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I recently decided to give Enlightenment a try, and it's absolutely fantastic.
 Thanks to everyone involved in making it awesome. 
 Things I liked: 
  
Crazy good performance
  
Smooth window animations even if the system is overloaded
 
Instantly opening, organized menus on an HDD
 
Tiny memory footprint
 
 Some unique default design decisions
  
Focus change on mouseover
 
Focus change not moving windows to the top
 
 
The window bar combining fast access with sufficient information to decide which entry is which window, keeping sorting.
 
Insanely configurable
  
The Key binding system is totally insane. The amount of Actions, the possibility to set contexts… I love it
 
Window settings almost on par with KDE
 
 Working and fast crash recovery
  
Problems I run into: 
  
Some semi-reproducable crashes (e.g. being in fullscreen with the mouse in a corner sometimes causes crashes)
 Selections often do not jump to the correct position. E.g. Selecting a keybinding does not jump to the assigned action reliably. Same with run with dialogue and search.
 
Some Application-choice menus are borderline unusable, because they list everything without a tree structure and the search is not sufficiently well-designed to make up for that. 
 Many little bugs (default application selection gui does not properly reset, Task bar sometimes "stuck"…)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I created a small 2D game engine named  Tiny.
The engine was created using Kotlin Multiplatform and can run on a JVM and JS.
Funny things: Games can be created using the programming language Lua.
Tiny is designed to help you create and test your ideas quickly and effectively. Not only can you run your games on your desktop computer, but you can also export them for the web, making it easy to share your creations with others.
You can create games easily with the hot reload, small API and Lua, which is very easy to learn.
If you want to test a game idea, to try to create your first game or just have fun, give it a try to  Tiny.

        <link href="https://www.williamlong.info/archives/7180.html"/>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[电脑硬盘里的数据，特别是个人创作的数据，对于个人来说价值非常高，一旦硬盘损坏，或电脑丢失，个人的数据都会面临永久损失的风险，因此做好数据备份是一个重要而长远的任务，怎么最好个人数据备份，以下是备份个人电脑硬盘数据的几种常见方法。


数据分类


做备份前，首先要将数据进行分类，一类是个人创作的数据，例如Office文件、TXT文件、照片等等，一类是从网上下载的数据，两类数据采取不同的备份策略。


通常情况下，硬盘可以按照上面的分类进行划分，C盘为操作系统盘，D盘为个人创作数据的盘，E盘为网上下载的软件、游戏等非个人创作的数据。


个人创作数据的备份


一般来说，个人创作的数据通常不会超过100G，并且文件可能具有多个历史版本，历史版本的文件可能也比较重要，这类数据就需要使用“同步盘”进行备份，常见的同步盘包括Dropbox、OneDrive、Google Drive、坚果云，百度网盘同步盘等等。利用这种云存储服务将数据备份到互联网上的远程服务器。这样即使电脑损坏或丢失，还可以通过云存储服务访问和恢复数据。如果文件错误编辑，还可以通过文件的历史版本还原以前的文件。


如果使用iPhone，那么照片的备份还有一个选项，就是iCloud，这个云服务和iPhone紧密结合，是备份iPhone照片的最佳选择之一。


非个人创作数据的备份


除了个人数据之外，我们还会从网上下载各类其他数据，例如电影、电视剧、软件、游戏、音乐等等，这些文件通常很大，有数T之多，备份的方法就以下几种：


1. 外部硬盘备份：使用外部硬盘驱动器将数据从电脑硬盘复制到外部存储设备。连接外部硬盘，然后使用文件管理工具将文件和文件夹复制到外部硬盘上。


2. 网盘：利用网盘服务将海量数据备份到互联网上的网盘服务器上。对于电影和电视剧来说，常见的网盘服务有百度网盘、阿里云盘、迅雷云盘等等，这三个网盘都有TV版，可以在电视机上播放网盘里存储的电影和电视剧，非常方便。


使用网盘存储文件存在和谐的问题，对一些可能被和谐的电影和电视剧，可以将其使用ZIP等工具加密打包上传到网盘，打包文件密码可以保存在文件名上，以防忘记。


对于游戏来说，建议使用steam、战网等游戏平台购买正版数字游戏，游戏在平台有安装包，游戏存档也在云端，这样游戏软件和存档都不会存在丢失的问题。


对于其他类型的数据，例如软件、压缩包文件等等，可以都使用网盘或外部硬盘备份，敏感数据可以加密，并保存好密码。


总的来说，无论选择哪种备份方法，都需要确保定期备份数据并存储在安全的地方，同时，检查备份文件的完整性，并测试恢复数据的过程，以确保备份成功且可用。]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[中国淡出超算 TOP500 榜单

最新的一期超级计算机 TOP500 榜单已经出炉，前十名和上一期一样，没有变化。美国橡树岭国家实验室的 Frontier 仍然是唯一上榜的 E 级的超大规模系统。在榜单中的排名前列的中国超算还是太湖之光和天河 2A，分别位列第 7 和第 10。在此次榜单中，中国有 134 台超算，2023 年只增加了一台吉利公司的超算。而之前的一些论文中的数据透露，中国还有更强大的超算，但是没有显示在榜单中。


消息来源：The Register



老王点评：显然，中国已经不再需要参加这种榜单的排名了。原因大家都懂。




微软展示云电脑 Windows 365 Boot

微软在 Build 2023 上展示了一个技术预览，让物理 PC 可以启动到在 Azure 中运行的虚拟 PC，而不是从其本地驱动器运行 Windows。这项名为 “Windows 365 Boot” 的技术被认为是 “共享设备的一个伟大的解决方案，在那里用独特的用户身份登录可以把你带到你自己的个人和安全的云电脑。”不过微软没有说这项技术何时能普遍使用。


消息来源：The Register



老王点评：云电脑并不是什么稀奇的事情。但是我依然还是喜欢用本地电脑 —— 哦，不，我不使用 Windows。




PyPI 正在减少存储的 IP 地址数据

之前，我们 报道 过，Python 官方软件包库 PyPI 应美国司法部要求向其提供了几个用户的数据，包括 IP 地址等信息。这引来了一些用户对隐私的关切。PyPI 表示，它正在努力减少它所存储的用户数据，其目的不是为了无法回应合法的信息要求，而是为了只存储必要的最低数量的数据，以免使用户受到不必要的隐私侵犯。但这一努力早在 2020 年就在进行，自从此次提供了数据后，又被重新启动。


消息来源：The Register



老王点评：监管与隐私之间的平衡，确实难以拿捏。不知道国外有没有要求必须保存什么数据、保存多久的要求。]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[在本文中，我们将介绍如何在 RHEL 9/8 上使用 Pacemaker 设置两节点高可用性 Apache 集群。


Pacemaker 是适用于类 Linux 操作系统的高可用性集群软件。Pacemaker 被称为“集群资源管理器”，它通过在集群节点之间进行资源故障转移来提供集群资源的最大可用性。Pacemaker 使用 Corosync 进行集群组件之间的心跳和内部通信，Corosync 还负责集群中的投票选举（Quorum）。

先决条件

在我们开始之前，请确保你拥有以下内容：


两台 RHEL 9/8 服务器

Red Hat 订阅或本地配置的仓库

通过 SSH 访问两台服务器

root 或 sudo 权限

互联网连接


实验室详情：


服务器 1：node1.example.com（192.168.1.6）

服务器 2：node2.exaple.com（192.168.1.7）

VIP：192.168.1.81

共享磁盘：/dev/sdb（2GB）


事不宜迟，让我们深入了解这些步骤。

1、更新 /etc/hosts 文件

在两个节点上的 /etc/hosts 文件中添加以下条目：

192.168.1.6  node1.example.com
192.168.1.7  node2.example.com


2、安装高可用包 Pacemaker

Pacemaker 和其他必需的包在 RHEL 9/8 的默认包仓库中不可用。因此，我们必须启用高可用仓库。在两个节点上运行以下订阅管理器命令。

对于 RHEL 9 服务器：

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[在这一章中，在实例的帮助下，学习如何使用函数并从中返回值。


就跟任何现代编程语言一样，Rust 也有函数。

你已经熟悉的函数是 main 函数。这个函数在程序启动时被调用。

但是其他函数呢？在本文中，你将学习如何在 Rust 程序中使用函数。

函数的基本语法

你可能已经在我们声明 main 函数时知道了这一点，不管怎么样，还是让我们看一下声明函数的语法。

// 声明函数
fn function_name() {
    <statement(s)>;
}

// 调用函数
function_name();


来让我们看一个简单的函数，它将字符串 "Hi there!" 打印到标准输出。

fn main() {
    greet();
}

fn greet() {
    println!("Hi there!");
}



📋 与 C 不一样的是，不管你是否要在声明或定义之前调用函数都没有关系。只要这个函数在 某个地方 被声明了，Rust 就会处理它。


正如预期，它的输出如下：

Hi there!


这挺简单的。让我们把它提升到下一个级别。让我们创建一个接受参数并返回值的函数。有没有参数和有没有返回值这两者之间无关。

使用函数接受参数

声明一个接受参数的函数的语法如下：

// 声明函数
fn function_name(variable_name: type) {
    <statement(s)>;
}

// 调用函数
function_name(value);


你可以把函数参数想象成一个传递给函数的 元组。它可以接受多种数据类型的参数，而且你可以接受任意多个参数。所以，你不必局限于接受相同类型的参数。

与某些语言不同的是，Rust 没有 …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We've all seen beautiful $PS1 prompts, but from what I can tell most people seem to write theirs all on one line. I suppose if you use some kind of external tool to build the prompt it's not so bad, but it makes it total hell for editing the prompt by hand if you ever feel like it.
 This also applies to other variables, but $PS1 is usually a rather complex variable so it's a good example. Mine is quite complex, and there's no way it would have reached this level of personalization if I hadn't discovered this trick.
 How it works
 Bash has a simple syntax for slapping something on the end of a variable: +=. This is called concatenation.
 So, for example say we have a variable foo="bar", and you want to add " bat" to the end of it. Just do it: foo+=" bat". Now $foo equals "bar bat".
 You can…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[《飞翔的旅驿——清末民初文学与文化》，陈建华主编，商务印书馆，2023年6月即出

“清末民初”作为文学史分期词语，含有数十年来学科划分及其观念的变迁，此刻在我记忆中浮现阅读和思考的轨辙，约略言之不无温故知新之效。自二十世纪五十年代起正典文学史有“近代”和“现代”之分，前者始自鸦片战争，后者始自“五四”运动。章培恒先生在本世纪初发表《关于中国现代文学的开端》一文说明在二十世纪初的中国文学中已出现鲁迅所说的“人性的解放”的因素，具现代文学“开端”的意义。如果“近代”分期以政治、经济为基础，那么章先生的“现代”意味着回归人性和文学自身，在他的《中国文学史新著》中可看到人性的文学如何从上古、中世到近世经历了迂回曲折的发展历程。虽然八十年代中期黄子平、陈平原和钱理群就提出“二十世纪中国文学”的构想，而章先生强调“人性的解放”，是为其文学史书写所定的精神原则。如他对徐枕亚《玉梨魂》的高度评价，打破古今、新旧、雅俗的成见，至今仍具启示性。另一端是李欧梵先生，近年来一再主张中国现代文学从晚清开始，这得追溯到他的1973年出版的《中国现代作家浪漫的一代》，书里把林纾、苏曼殊和徐志摩、郁达夫等同样看作“现代”作家，这和当时流行的“近代”和“现代”的文学史概念很不一样，特别是林纾臭名昭著，和新文学形同冰炭，现在我们对他的认识已大为改观。对于晚清研究，不能不提王德威先生的《被压抑的现代性》，除“谴责”之外对“狎邪”“侠义”和“科幻”等小说类型展开论述，晚清小说如惊艳还魂，令人刮目相看。另外对于“重写文学史”厥功甚伟的是范伯群先生及其研究团队，2000年出版的《中国近现代通俗文学史》凝聚着他们多年的辛勤耕耘，“近现代”意谓起自《海上花列传》至民国时期的“通俗”作品的研究范围。他们还编著了许多“礼拜六-鸳鸯蝴蝶派”作家评传、作品选集等，有效拓展了文学观念、空间与市场。

 which is available since February 2022 for Linux and runs quite well.
 https://github.com/86Box/86Box/releases/
 But their manager application (to handle more than one emulated PC system) was still only Windows with a lot of Win32 calls and such. It runs under Wine, but okay, that's possible, but a hassle.
 So, my fork of the manager now runs under Linux (I test with Ubuntu 20.04 myself):

 I'm sharing it here because maybe there are others who like to install a 486 DX system, too ;-)

	Bcrypt's endurance can be attributed to several other factors

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[“AI不会让你失业，会用AI的人才会让你失业。”打出这样的宣传标语，培训他人使用ChatGPT成为了近期最火爆的副业。在部分知识付费社群上，短短三个月内涌现出大量以培训ChatGPT技能为名的课程。


2023年，美国OpenAI公司研发的ChatGPT成为了火遍全球的人工智能软件，它在翻译、文案撰写、查资料等多方面的智能表现，引发了人类对于失业的担忧。


OpenAl 3月发布论文预言，美国80%的工作都会受到AI的影响；高盛则预测，生成式AI会导致劳动力市场受到重大冲击，使全球3亿个工作岗位实现自动化，并且美国7%的工作岗位将被AI取代。


一时之间，学习使用ChatGPT从而更好地完成工作，成为职场风潮。市场需求催生之下，程序员、自媒体从业者纷纷开班培训教授职场人士如何使用AI。在ChatGPT大批量取代人类工作之前，已经有人率先利用ChatGPT变现。


据记者在知识付费平台上注意到，一位自称是前360技术总监、担任过独角兽公司CTO的博主发布的ChatGPT学习课程，两个月时间已经吸引了超过2万名学员。


在这门单人收费368元的课程中，该博主已经陆续更新了超过5000篇内容，总营收达到861万元。另有头部博主在不到70天的时间里，运营课程带来了超过330万元的收入。


据不完全统计，仅在单一学习平台上，以“教你使用ChatGPT”为名开设相关课程的团队就超过了20个。这些课程收费通常不超过500元，培训内容包括办公应用高效生成PPT、AI绘图、自媒体内容生成等。


与此同时，教人使用ChatGPT也已成为招聘市场上火爆的副业。


据记者在招聘平台搜索发现，ChatGPT兼职讲师的时薪在50至100元，岗位要求包括“对OpenAI的ChatGPT3.5至上线最新版本熟练使用。”GPT研究员岗位月薪则能达到2至4万元，但需要员工能够利用ChatGPT帮助公司研发团队提高算法能力。


需要注意的是，最火副业引来各路人马纷纷下场创业，希望在行业红利期分得一杯羹，但学员却很难鉴别培训课程品质的优劣。对外经济贸易大学数字经济与法律创新研究中心主任许可接受记者采访表示，从法律角度来说，课程属于信用品，即使在消费之后，用户可能也不清楚其效益如何。


许可建议，想要学习的职场人士可以关注培训班的授课老师是否长期关注该领域。如果教师并非从事自然语言处理或研发工作，也需具备丰富的实操技能和教学能力。另外，之前学员发布的课程评价第三方测评内容也是重点参考方向。


针对中英文的环境中都涌现出大量ChatGPT培训课，许可指出，只要培训资质合法且课程内容不涉及传销等不良内容，发展高薪副业都属于正常的市场竞争，但部分培训者在宣传课程中所打出的口号却存在误导性。


“未来，职场人的发力点是发展不会被AI取代的能力，而非比较谁更会操作ChatGPT。”许可认为，当发展副业的“老师们”进行夸张宣传从而获利时，容易给人们传播紧张焦虑的情绪。对于大多数职场人来说，应当在提高自身的人工智能素养的同时，抱有理性的态度去对待新技术。
