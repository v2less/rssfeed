        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello r/linux community,
 I'm currently facing an issue with my Linux setup and could use some advice. I've configured my /etc/hosts.deny
 file and firewall rules to restrict access, but strangely, NoMachine still manages to establish connections. I'm puzzled as to why this is happening.
 Ufw is configurated to block everything in and my /etc/hosts.deny is ALL:ALL
 Despite these precautions, NoMachine seems to bypass these restrictions. Has anyone else experienced a similar situation, or could provide some insights into why this might be occurring?
 I'd greatly appreciate any help or suggestions you can offer. Thank you in advance!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[你最钟爱哪一个开源密码管理器？


Bitwarden 和 Proton Pass 是两个杰出的开源密码管理器。

Bitwarden 已经成为一个可靠的选择，运行稳定已经超过六年了，而 Proton Pass 则是较新的参与者。

你应该选哪一个呢？是选择已被大众信任的密码管理器还是选择由以隐私为导向的 Proton 新开发的产品?

我一直使用 Bitwarden 和带高级特性的 Proton Pass。主要使用的是 Bitwarden，但自 Proton Pass 推出后我也在试用它。

在这里，我会分享我对两者的使用体验，以及在选择密码管理器时需要了解的一些注意事项。

应用场景和应用程序的可用性

选用密码管理器时，应用程序的可用情况和你的使用场景起着重要角色。

你需要提些问题给自己：


我在哪些地方（如桌面、移动设备或网页浏览器）需要密码管理器？

它有提供哪些额外功能？

是否坚持使用一个服务满足多种功能需求？


我会在文章的后半部分详细阐述这些功能特性。但首先，你需要确定你想在哪里使用密码管理器，以及是否希望单独保持密码管理器服务。

Proton Pass

在编写本文时，Proton Pass 仅以 浏览器扩展 形式存在，同时提供给 移动平台 使用。



你可以为 Mozilla Firefox、Google Chrome、Brave、Edge 及其它基于 Chrome 的浏览器获取扩展。你也可以选择在你的 安卓或 iOS 设备上安装它。



✅ 如果你不需要桌面应用的密码管理器，同时希望继续使用 Proton 提供的全部服务，那么 Proton Pass 是一个适合的选择。

Bitwarden

反之，Bitwarden 可以作为 桌面应用，支持在 Windows、 macOS、Linux 上运…]]></summary>

I know Midnight Commander exists, but that's just Norton Commander. Be an interesting utility for the terminal.
 Also some important info is that I'm in an Arch based distro (EndeavourOS), so the apt and AUR can both be sourced. :3
 ​
 I've realized what I said is a literal description of a floating wm :P What are some classic style window managers I can use? Thx!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Right now normies have to go out of their way to install Linux, so when software does not work they blame the OS as they wortked so hard for their software not to work, on the other hand if a normie bought it on a store shelf from Dell and Adobe did not work they would call Adobe and complain that their software did not work on their Dell and that Adobe software should work on all the Dells, as they dont see the computer as a Linux computer, but as a Dell that Adobe is too lazy to support. Also even if Adobe does not make a Linux port, people still wont see it as a Linux failing, but more in line the with difference between buying a Mac and a PC, just that this line of Dell's needs you to use different software just like on a Mac.
 ​
 Instead of Linux being seen as "Windows Light" for failing to run every single windows app it would be seen as a third choice for people to make. Instead of Linux being the counter culture hacker man OS it is the customization and performance OS for people that are fine using GIMP and Kdenlive over Adobe, just how a mac is the consistent aesthetic OS for people that dont like playing video games or Windows is the OS tat lets you run every app ever made, if you are fine with big brother and horrible bloat. But for the love of god dont scare people by taking about how Linux has 90 compatibility layers for Windows and 80% of all Windows apps work on Linux, because then all people will think is that Linux is trying to be Windows Light and that they are losing out on 20% of software. Instead focus on how just like using a mac, you have to accept alternatives. 
 TLDR: preinstalls can help software availability, and when marketing it to normies make it sound like the change to MacOS over being Windows Light.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Which is that i seem to compositor hop a lot. And i'm not talking about wayland compositors, but about all the different picom forks over on X. I started by trying out the jonaburg fork when i started using a standalone window manager for the first time. It kept crashing everytime i turned off my monitor, so i hopped over to the FT-Labs fork, which has great animations but they didn't work for workspace switching. Then i hopped to the pijulius fork, which did have working animations for workspace switching. Unfortunately, you can't use rounded corners and blur at the same time with that fork, plus it also doesn't have round borders feature, but i decided to just have square corners and call it a day. This week i found out that that the main yshui fork has merged the round borders code, and i started craving rounded corners again, so i'm back on the main picom fork, and decided that the fading effects are good enough for me and i can live without the animations. Seems like you just have to sacrifice something with every fork you use. Well anyway, wanted to end it with a question: do you prefer a particular fork of picom? Or do you perhaps not care about compositing at all and don't use a compositor?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[《古舟子咏》（插图珍藏版），[英]塞缪尔·泰勒·柯勒律治著，[美]爱德华·A.威尔逊绘，叶紫译，江苏凤凰文艺出版社｜后浪2022年12月出版，124页，88.00元

柯勒律治（S. T. Coleridge，1772-1834）是英国诗史上一位以极少量的经典诗作而名垂后世的大诗人。他一生共创作了三百来首诗歌，但为人称道的作品不过十来首，而真正被视为无可复制的杰作的只有《忽必烈汗》（Kubla Khan）、《克里斯德蓓》（Christabel）和《古舟子咏》（The Rime of the Ancient Mariner）这三首魔魅诗篇（daemonic poems）。前两首均是未完成的残篇，唯有《古舟子咏》是完篇，以古民谣的风格有始有终地讲述了一个水手无故杀害一只信天翁，随后同行的两百个水手离奇毙命而自己却侥幸生还的曲折故事。早在上世纪二三十年代，诗人朱湘就有过译介（译稿完成于二十年代末留美期间，不过直到1935年才发表于其译诗遗集《番石榴集》），八十年代后又有吕千飞、杨德豫、屠岸等诸位先生的译本，其中以杨德豫的译本最受欢迎。不过，翻译只能无限靠近原作，世上恐无绝对完美的译本。早先的译本可能存在着理解上的错误，并且随着时代的变迁，会出现用语滞后的情况。理想的情况是经典的作品不时有新的译本出现，这既是向原作者的致敬，也是对前辈译者的告慰。叶紫老师的最新译作《古舟子咏》（江苏凤凰文艺出版社，2022年）参照的版本权威、译文准确、配图新颖、导读经典，在我看来就是一次成功的重译。
原诗版本变迁略述
柯勒律治有改诗的癖好。姑且不论作品出版前的反复润色，就是在出版后，他还要不停修改。《古舟子咏》的版本众多，据权威统计，诗人生前共有十八个版本印行（Jack Stillinger, Coleridge and Textual Instability: The Multiple Versi…]]></summary>

传统的计算芯片每次计算时仍然需要使用称为 RAM 的外部存储器。这种在芯片间穿梭数据的方式会减慢速度，这种现象被称为“冯·诺依曼瓶颈”。IBM 研发处一种名为 “NorthPole” 处理器芯片无需访问外部存储器，因此执行图像识别等任务的速度比现有架构更快，同时“它的能效简直令人难以置信”。NorthPole 由 256 个计算单元组成，每个单元都有自己的内存，“在单元中缓解了冯·诺依曼瓶颈”。这些单元通过网络连接在一起，其灵感来自于人类大脑皮层各部分之间的白质连接。这种设计思路大部分以前就存在，但从未在一个芯片中结合过。研究人员说，这表明计算和内存可以大规模集成，“将撼动计算机体系结构的惯常思维”。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[本篇文章作为终端基础教程系列的一部分，介绍如何在 Linux 命令行中，利用绝对路径和相对路径实现目录切换。


Linux 的 cd 命令让你可以轻松切换文件夹（即目录）。只需提供你要切换到的文件夹路径即可。

cd path_to_directory


然而对于 Linux 新人来说，可能会在路径的指定上有所困扰。

首先，让我们解决这个问题。

理解 Linux 中的路径

在 Linux 文件系统中，路径是用来追踪文件位置的信息。所有的路径都从根目录开始，然后向下延伸。

你可以通过下面的方式查看当前所在的位置：

pwd


结果可能是类似于 /home/username 的输出。注意，这里的 username 将会是你自己的用户名。

你可以注意到，路径是由 / 符号和目录名组成的。比如路径 /home/abhishek/scripts， 表示 scripts 是在文件夹 abhishek 之内，而文件夹 abhishek 在 home 文件夹之内。要注意，第一个 '/' 是指根目录（即文件系统的开始处），后面的 '/' 则作为目录的分隔符。




🖥️ 在终端中键入 ls /，然后按回车。你将会看到根目录下的所有内容，试试看！


接下来，让我们学习两种常见的路径指定方式：绝对路径和相对路径。

绝对路径：这种路径从根开始，然后一直扩展到你需要的位置。如果一个路径是以 / 开头，那就说明它是一个绝对路径。

相对路径：这是相对于你文件系统中当前位置的路径。如果我当前位置在 /home/abhishek，并且我需要去 /home/abhishek/Documents， 我只需要简单地切换到 Documents，而不需要指定整个绝对路径 /home/abhishek/Documents。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[通过新的 Tor 浏览器更新提升你的私人网络体验！


Tor 浏览器是访问 Tor 网络 的流行方式之一，它一直是许多想要规避对其施加的限制的人的首选，甚至是那些注重隐私的人的首选。

当然，使用 Tor 浏览器是最简单的 提高隐私的方法。

虽然 Tor 浏览器基于 Mozilla Firefox，但它也进行了一些调整。

在最新的主要更新中，让我们看看发生了什么变化。

🆕 Tor 浏览器 13.0：有什么新变化？



据开发人员介绍，Tor 浏览器 13.0 基于 Firefox ESR 115，并带来了一年的推送到上游的修改。

过渡到较新的 Firefox 版本还允许他们利用 Firefox 113 中引入的改进的辅助功能引擎。

因此，使用屏幕阅读器等辅助技术的用户现在可以在使用 Tor 浏览器时获得比以往更好的性能。

此版本的亮点包括：


改进的 “信封打印Letterboxing” 功能

更新主页

更新徽标


改进的 “信封打印Letterboxing” 功能



Tor 浏览器 13.0 版本中的 “信封打印Letterboxing” 功能得到了重要更新。

（LCTT 译注：“信封打印Letterboxing” 是一种网络浏览隐私保护技术，它通过为浏览器窗口添加白色填充（看起来像一个信封的周围），来防止网站跟踪你的浏览行为。当你改变浏览器窗口的大小时，“信封打印” 功能会在周边提供白色填充，确保窗口大小始终为特定的大众标准尺寸。这意味着即使你改变窗口大小，那些尝试通过窗口尺寸来跟踪你的网站也无法获取独特的信息。）

开发人员发现 1000×1000 像素的默认 “信封打印” 尺寸存在问题，许多现代网站无法正常运行，导致这些网站切换到适用于平板电脑和智能手机的布局。

有些网站甚至会显示桌面网站，但只有横向滚动条。为了解决这个问题，他们调整了窗口的大小，最大为 1400×900 像素。

对于最终用户来说，这意味着你无需手动调整窗口大小即可获得合适的尺寸。

他们还补充说：


桌面版 Tor 浏览器不应再在大屏幕上触发响应断点，并且我们的绝大多数桌面用户将看到熟悉的横向纵横比，更符合现代浏览器的要求。

通过计算，我们选择了这一特定尺寸，以便为新窗口提供更大的空间，同时又不会增加过多的桶数量。


更新了主页



Tor 浏览器主页的更新已经等了很长时间了。在此版本中，它展示了更新的徽标（更多内容见下文）以及一个新功能 —— “洋葱化的” DuckDuckGo，用于访问其 “.onion 站点”。

这也与我之前提到的改进的辅助功能引擎齐头并进，从而为屏幕阅读器和其他辅助技术的用户提供更好的支持。

他们还修复了可怕的“红屏死亡”错误，该错误在打开新的主页选项卡时偶尔会弹出。

更新徽标



从文章的开头你就可能已经注意到 Tor 浏览器的徽标有些不同。

实际上，Tor 浏览器所有版本的徽标都已更新，外观更加干净和现代。

这个熟悉的“洋葱标志”已经存在了一段时间，它是由当时的社区民意调查选出的。很高兴看到他们仍在努力改进它。

这些只是该版本的主要亮点，你可以通过 官方发行说明 了解所有技术修复和其他改进。

📥 下载 Tor 浏览器 13.0

此版本的 Tor 浏览器适用于 Linux、Windows、Android、 和 macOS。你可以前往官方网站获取你选择的套餐。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Jeff Xu recently proposed
the addition of a new system call, named mseal(), that would allow
applications to prevent modifications to selected memory mappings.  It
would enable the hardening of user-space applications against certain types
of attacks; some other operating systems have this type of feature already.
There is support for adding this type of mechanism to the Linux kernel as
well, but it has become clear that mseal() will not land in the
mainline in anything resembling its current form.  Instead, it has become
an example of how not to do kernel development at a number of levels.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all,
 I noticed that systemd-journal is somewhat cryptic when it comes to logs centralization.
 So, at Netdata we created a guide and some helper scripts to assist in the creation of a secure logs management system using self-signed certificates.
 Check it here.
 If you combine the above with Netdata, you will get all your logs on a server with a powerful UI to explore, query and filter your logs, that looks like this:
 Netdata systemd-journal Explorer plugin
 We created a couple also interesting guides:
  
passive centralization with encryption (the one mentioned above)
 passive centralization without encryption
 active centralization without encryption
  
We suggest however to use passive centralization with encryption, as it is the more reliable and secure.
 If you have any comments to enhance these guides, please provide feedback.
 Enjoy!

 Ever since I switched from Windows I’ve absolutely loved Ubuntu. Sure the snap store is a little clunky and I’d rather install apps through .deb files or apt but it’s not an issue since you always have choice.
 I’ve not really played around with other distros so I can’t objectively say if Ubuntu is better or worse. I only chose Ubuntu because it’s widely used and stable.
 So is there something about Ubuntu in terms of features or otherwise which makes it a significantly worse experience than other distros?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[内存 RowHammer 保护措施被新的方法击破

2015 年，研究人员发现了一种被称之为 RowHammer 的攻击方式，当一个用户级应用程序反复访问 DDR 内存芯片的特定区域，可以导致比特翻转。比特翻转Bitflips 是指储存在电子设备上的个别比特发生翻转的事件，比如从 0 变为 1 或反之。各个内存厂商在后续产品中纷纷加入了抵御 RowHammer 攻击的保护措施，主要方法是限制程序在给定时间内打开和关闭目标芯片区域的次数。现在，研究人员发明了被称之为 RowPress 的新方法，能在部署了最新的 RowHammer 保护措施的 DRAM 中诱发比特翻转。RowPress 不是反复“锤击”选定区域，而是让其保持更长的打开时间。将这一方法和 RowHammer 结合可进一步提高这种攻击的威力。研究人员表示，“这本身并不是一种攻击。它只是表明比特翻转是可能的，而且很多，这很容易成为攻击的基础”。

老王点评：如果类似的方法层出不穷，那或许是该考虑新的内存技术了。




一种新的路灯技术可以避免光污染对天文望远镜的影响

光污染对天文学的威胁与日俱增，现代望远镜高度敏感，能感受到距离 50 甚至 200 公里的城市室外照明的影响。一项研究发现，星星正在以平均每年 10% 的速度从天空中“消失”。一项名为 “DarkSkyProtector” 的技术可以“让望远镜看到几乎是一片黑暗的天空”。该方案依赖于三个组件：一个能让 LED 灯以人眼无法察觉的极高频率闪烁的简单装置、一个全球定位系统接收器，以及望远镜摄像头上一个能与 LED 灯同步闪烁的特殊设计的快门。全球定位系统技术引导望远镜的快门只在 LED 灯熄灭的瞬间打开。该技术可以将天文图像中不必要的天空辉光减少 94%。


消息来源：Space



老王点评：技术的进步可以解决技术带来的副作用。另外，是不是可以顺便把马斯克的星链轨迹也一起消除了。




Debian 继续支持 /usr 合并

Debian 12 的目标是采用与其他 Linux 发行版类似的合并 /usr 文件系统布局，即 /{bin,sbin,lib}/ 目录成为 /usr/{bin,sbin,lib}/ 的符号链接。但 Debian 技术委员会在今年早些时候决定暂停合并 /usr 文件。不过，随着 Debian 12 正式发布几个月后，这一暂停决定被废止了。Debian 的合并 /usr 动作有望在两年后的 Debian 13 发布时全部完成。


消息来源：Phoronix



老王点评：这就是历史遗留问题，依我看，其实大可不必这么小心翼翼。]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[露易丝·格丽克（1943.4.22—2023.10.13）

2020年10月8日，美国诗人露易丝·格丽克（Louise Glück）凭借自己“无可辩驳的诗意之音”，获得了当年的诺贝尔文学奖。三年后，也即2023年10月13日，格丽克因病患而离世。其实，死亡本身构成了格丽克诗作的一个核心主题。下文试图以其诗集《阿弗尔诺》（Averno，2006）和《村居生活》（A Village Life，2009）为中心（两部诗集的中译本均收录于《直到世界反映了灵魂最深层的需要》，以下引自同书诗句只标明页码），兼及其他，探析格丽克对死亡的复杂之思和应对之法。

《直到世界反映了灵魂最深层的需要》，[美]露易丝·格丽克著，柳向阳、范静哗译，上海人民出版社｜世纪文景，2016年4月出版，363页，65.00元

就在格丽克出生前七天，她的姐姐已不幸离世。姐姐的早夭不仅沉重地打击了她的父母，也使她的童年笼罩在“幸存者”的负疚感中。十六岁时，格丽克又因厌食症而获得濒死体验。童年和青春、自我与他者，这些交织的死亡体验使格丽克过早地直面死亡，而这又是她无力应对的。因此，对死亡的浓烈恐惧成为她最显在的心理状态，死亡意识一直萦绕在她的脑海中，无法纾解和排遣。
对于格丽克而言，死亡是一个普遍事件，每天甚至每刻都在发生。在《阿勒山》（1990）中《幻想》一诗的开篇，诗人就写道：“我要告诉你件事情：每天/人都在死亡。而这只是个开头。”（337页）并且，每个人的死亡都自出生起就已经开始了。“生出来，身体便与死亡定了约。/从那个时刻起，要做的一切都是欺诈——”（184页）“出生，而非死亡，才是难以承受的损失。”（252页）这种即生即死、生为死源的观念从她的诗集处女作《头生子》（1968）就已经产生了。
在《村居生活》一诗中，诗人写道：
死亡与无定等着我，
也等着所有的人，阴影揣度着我，
因为它并不急于摧毁一个…]]></summary>

thoughts naturally turn to the programming interface as specified by POSIX,
along with numerous extensions added over the years.  But glibc also
provides a "tunables" interface to control how the library operates; rather
than being managed by a C API, tunables are set with the
GLIBC_TUNABLES environment
variable.  Glibc tunables have been a part of a few security problems
involving setuid binaries, most recently the "Looney
Tunables" bug disclosed at the beginning of October.  The glibc
developers are now considering significant changes to tunable handling in
the hope of avoiding such problems in the future.]]></summary>

Autotab lets you create browser automations that actually work. We designed it around two principles:
    1. Show, don’t tell: In a domain like web automation, it's often easier to *show* the model what you want rather than to explain it in sentences.

    2. Code is the best output: Code is easy to inspect and enables manual tweaking of the model’s suggested actions. On top of that, code output avoids lock in and is straightforward to extend and integrate with larger projects.

We'd love to hear what you think!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I had an idea/feature request for Linux itself.
 With many debian based distros (Arch has this too but it is a different GUI) you can encrypt your entire computer which will require you to enter a password to decrypt it when booting it up.
 On every linux distro I used weather it is debian or arch based, you can setup a specific user to be the user the computer automatically logins to when the system boots up.
 The annoying thing about using the auto login feature for a user is that it does not unlock the keyring. If you have apps setup to run in the background on startup, they may require you to unlock your keyring. Sure, you can set the keyring password to be blank but this is not a good idea for security reasons.
 This was my idea to solve this. It will require the computer to be setup to be fully encrypted however.
 The auto login users keyring password will be stored and be encrypted using the system encrypted password. When the computer is booted up and unlocked, it will decrypt the keyring password and use that to unlock the users keyring when logging into the user.
 This way the keyring gets unlocked but the keyring password is stored secure and not in plain text.
 Not sure the best place to make this feature request? Debain github repo perhaps?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This is a small quality of life improvement for tmux I just set up. You can read slightly more context on my blog post but I just wanted to share the function here.
 tmac () { tmux has-session -t "$1" 2>/dev/null if [ $? != 0 ]; then tmux new-session -s "$1" -d fi tmux attach -t "$1" } _tmac_complete() { local word=${COMP_WORDS[COMP_CWORD]} local sessions=$(tmux list-sessions -F "#{session_name}" 2>/dev/null) COMPREPLY=( $(compgen -W "$sessions" -- "$word") ) } complete -F _tmac_complete tmac 
 This command allows you to easily use your bash history to attach to sessions you launch, it allows you to essentially use tmux ls within your attach command just by hitting tab. For whatever reason, tmux attach allows you to attach based on a prefix but it doesn't autocomplete so if you have more than one session wit the same prefix it won't let you know. The final command combines tmux ls, tmux new-session, and tmux attach into a single convenient command: tmac.

 Rhino Linux was designed with user control in mind. The user should have the right to choose, and that should extend to their choice desktop environments as well. 
 UBXI, put simply, is a way for our users to maintain their own desktop environment packages and distribution spins. Unicorn is more than just the XFCE base it was built on, it’s an idea that helps to improve the Rhino Linux desktop experience, and Rhino Linux is more than the desktop environment the user interacts with.

微软内部数据显示，Windows 11 的活跃设备使用量最近刚刚突破 4 亿台，并在稳步攀升，预计到 2024 年初将达到 5 亿台。这意味着微软用了大约两年的时间才使 Windows 11 的月活跃设备达到 4 亿台。这一速度明显慢于 Windows 10，后者仅用了一年多的时间，并最终在 2020 年初达到了 10 亿用户。当然，这和微软对待它们的升级策略不同有很大关系。

谷歌的安卓上的恶意软件系统 “Google Play Protect” 一直以来都能检查侧载应用程序中的恶意软件，但它使用的是定义文件等更快的技术，而且是在后台悄悄进行的。这项新技术将通过全屏 “扫描” 界面延迟应用程序的安装，同时谷歌将对应用程序代码进行深度扫描。谷歌在博文中称，这是 “在代码层面进行实时扫描，以打击新型恶意应用程序” ，而且它可以 “在安装从未扫描过的应用程序时推荐进行实时应用程序扫描，以帮助检测新出现的威胁”。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ubuntu MATE 23.10 发布了！


在所有的 Ubuntu 版本中，Ubuntu MATE 的升级总是非常有趣的。

不过，最近发布的 Ubuntu MATE 决定坚持小幅改动，并进行预期的软件包升级和修复。你可能知道为什么！

对于不了解的读者：这是为了开发我们去年报道过的 计划中的 Debian MATE 定制版。

说到这里，让我重点介绍一下这些变化。


💡 Ubuntu MATE 23.10 将支持九个月，直至 2024 年 7 月。


Ubuntu MATE 23.10：有什么新功能？



Ubuntu MATE 23.10 受益于 Ubuntu 23.10 推出的所有好东西。

此外，这里还有一些改进：


MATE 桌面更新至 v1.26.2。

添加更多人工智能生成的壁纸。

应用更新。


MATE 桌面升级

在最新的 MATE 桌面 1.26.2 中，你将获得大量错误修复和一些小的改进。

升级包括以下内容：


更新 MATE 用户指南 v1.26.2-1

改进门户支持

改进系统监视器，以便从 /usr/libexec 获取 libexec 文件

修正 MATE 会话管理器，使其更好地与系统监视器配合使用

mate-utils 1.26.1-1 修复了内存泄漏问题


额外的人工智能生成的壁纸



虽然你已经可以从 Ubuntu 23.10 更新合集 中下载一些有趣的壁纸，但在这里你还能获得额外的壁纸（如上面的截图所示）。

Simon Butcher 是使用前沿的 Diffusion 模型制作这款壁纸的人，他提到：


由于牛头人是一种想象中的生物，因此对其的解释往往千差万别。我想制作一个具有漫画小说风格的强大生物图像，尽管不像许多描述那样令人毛骨悚然。

最新开源的 Stable Diffusion XL 基本模型在更高分辨率下进行了训练，质量上的差异非常明显，尤其是在整体一致性和细节方面，同时减少了图像中的解剖不规则性。图像是使用 Linux 和英伟达 A100 80GB GPU 在本地制作的，从最初的文本提示开始，使用 img2img、修复和放大功能进行完善。


Linux 内核 6.5

当然，Linux 内核 6.5 还能为硬件带来更好的兼容性、新代组件和其他改进。



其他改进

主要的应用程序升级包括 Firefox 118、Celluloid 0.25、Evolution 3.50 和 LibreOffice 7.6.1。

所有这些都将改善用户体验。

📥 获取 Ubuntu MATE 23.10

你可以从 官方网站 或 Ubuntu 仓库 下载 Ubuntu MATE 23.10 ISO。


Ubuntu MATE 23.10


如果你是现有用户并希望升级，请按照 发布说明 中的官方说明进行操作。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[这篇文章将探索 Btrfs 中的透明文件系统压缩，以及它如何帮助节省存储空间。这篇文章是《Btrfs 详解》系列文章中的一篇。从 Fedora Linux 33 开始，Btrfs 就是 Fedora Workstation 和 Fedora Silverblue 的默认文件系统。

如果你错过了，这里是本系列的上一篇文章：Btrfs 详解：快照。

简介

很多人都经历过存储空间用完的情况。也许你想从互联网下载一个大文件，或者你需要快速从你的手机中复制些照片，然后操作突然失败。虽然存储空间成本正在稳步降低，但越来越多的设备要么制造时就是固定数量的存储容量，要么最终用户难以扩展其存储容量。

但当你的存储空间不足时你可以做什么呢？也许你会求助于云存储，或者你可以随身携带一些外部存储设备。

在这篇文章里我会研究该问题的另一种解决方案：透明的文件系统压缩，这是 Btrfs 的一个特性。理想情况下，这将解决你的存储问题，同时几乎不需要对你的系统进行修改！让我们来看看是如何做到的。

透明压缩的解释

首先，让我们来探寻 透明 压缩是什么意思。你可以通过像 gzip、xz 或者 bzip2 这些压缩算法去压缩文件。这通常是显式操作：你利用一个压缩工具并且让它操作你的文件。虽然根据文件的内容，节约了空间，这有一个主要的缺点：当你想读取文件或者修改的时候，你得先解压缩。

这不仅是一个乏味的过程，而且也暂时打破了你之前节省的空间。再者，你最终解压了你不想访问的那部分文件内容。明显有比这更好的方法！

相反，透明压缩发生在文件系统级别。在这里，压缩的文件对用户看起来像常规的未压缩文件一样。但是，它们是被压缩后存储在硬盘上的。这之所以可行，是因为操作系统仅仅选择性地访问那部分文件，并且确保在向磁盘写入更新时再次压缩它们。

这里的压缩是透明的在于它不被用户感知，除了在文…]]></summary>

2023年10月9日，瑞典皇家科学院将2023年诺贝尔经济学奖授予克劳迪娅·戈尔丁（Claudia Goldin）。诺奖官方认为，戈尔丁首次全面介绍了几个世纪以来妇女的收入和劳动力市场参与情况。她的研究揭示了变化的原因，以及剩余性别差距的主要来源，“促进了我们对女性劳动力市场结果的理解”，揭示了劳动力市场性别差异的主要驱动因素。综合有关报道给出的具体理由是：从历史上看，收入中的性别差距很大程度上可以用教育和职业选择的差异来解释。但是戈尔丁的研究表明，这种收入差异的大部分现在是在同一职业的女性之 间，而且很大程度上是随着第一个孩子的出生而产生的。经济学奖委员会主席Jakob Svensson表示，了解女性在劳动中的作用对社会很重要；戈尔丁的开创性研究，令我们现在对潜在因素以及未来可能需要解决的障碍有了更多的了解。

瑞典皇家科学院将2023年诺贝尔经济学奖授予克劳迪娅·戈尔丁

实际上，戈尔丁关于美国经济中女性角色的历史演变的研究一直受到学界关注和高度评价，其研究方法和特点是利用大量数据结合计量经济学等方法进行实证研究。在性别歧视、教育发展史和工资结构差距演化等方面，均以从历史切入现实的研究视角进行分析，其研究结论往往具有针对当前问题的实际意义。戈尔丁认为，生活中女性总是在不断地支付或多或少的“性别成本”，这源于女性被轻视的历史以及人们对女性错误的认识。戈尔丁是第三位获得诺贝尔经济学奖的女性经济学家，在她之前的埃莉诺·奥斯特罗姆和埃丝特·迪弗洛的研究方向分别是公共选择和减轻贫困。有学者认为今后会有更多的女经济学家获得诺贝尔经济学奖，但是我认为更重要的是这说明关于性别角色在经济发展中的作用与问题将受到更多关注和研究。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[你有要说明的地方吗？请将它们添加到你的 Bash 脚本中。


在 Bash 脚本中添加注释是保持代码整洁且易于理解的最有效方法之一。

你可能会问为什么。

假设你的脚本包含一个复杂的正则表达式或多个复杂的代码块，在这种情况下，你可以添加注释，以便其他开发人员或你可以了解该代码块的含义。

注释掉部分代码也有助于调试脚本。

在本教程中，我将引导你了解在 Bash 脚本中添加注释的三种方法：


单行注释

行内评论

多行注释


那么让我们从第一个开始。

Bash 中的单行注释

要添加单行注释，你必须将哈希符号（#）放在行的开头并编写注释。

这是一个简单的例子：

#!/bin/bash
# This is a comment
echo "Hello, World!"


执行时，注释将被忽略，当我执行上面的命令时，它看起来像这样：




💡 # 注释规则的唯一例外是脚本开头的 #!/bin/bash 行。它称为 释伴，用于指定运行脚本时要使用的解释器。有不同的 Shell，语法也可能不同。因此，一个好的做法是指定脚本是为哪个 Shell 编写的。例如，如果是 ksh，则可以使用 #!/bin/ksh.


Bash 脚本中的内联注释

或者，你可以将注释放在代码块内以记录该特定行的用途。


🚧 # 之后的任何内容在该行结束之前都不会执行，因此请确保在代码末尾添加注释。


这是一个简单的例子：

#!/bin/bash
echo "Hello, World!" #Prints hello world




Bash 中的多行注释


🚧 Bash 中没有内置的多行注释功能。但是，有一些解决方法可以实现多行注释效果。


顾名思义，Bash 脚本中的多行注释允许你在多行中编…]]></summary>

性别作为一种社会身份属性，从古至今影响着女性生活。古代史书中的女性往往以男性的母亲、妻子或女儿的身份被记载，由于依附地位不可否认，故而女性的“失语”状态也是一种客观存在。但这并不意味着女性均沦为男性的陪衬与背景，无关家国兴衰与历史走向。以唐代为例，长孙皇后、武则天、上官婉儿、太平公主都曾打破性别之“镣铐”，在政治舞台上发挥自己的能量，在传世文献甚至官修正史里留下专属篇章。因此有学者将唐代称为“红妆时代”。
在这样的时代，有一位女性颇为神秘，以她为主角的画作流传至今，却无人知晓她是画中何人；《旧唐书》《新唐书》《资治通鉴》、宋人笔记、元明清诗词、戏曲都诉说着她的故事，但难免各执一词、情节冲突：她是皇帝盛宠的外戚，曾被指为引发安史之乱的罪魁祸首，也是后世不断书写、赞美的天真女郎、绝代佳人。她就是唐虢国夫人。

《虢国夫人游春图》，故宫博物院

自唐至元、明、清各代，史料里多样且矛盾的描述汇集于虢国夫人一身，塑造着警醒帝王的女祸典型，勾勒出不流于时俗的古代名姬。一位历史上的真实女性为何承载着如此复杂的“身份”，她究竟有怎样的人生故事，经历过哪些政治风波，是不是“任人打扮的小姑娘”（胡适语）？北京大学李志生先生的新书《唐虢国夫人：文本与日常生活》（以下简称该书）从纷繁杂沓的文献中厘清历史与演义、真实与虚构，追索不同时期文人眼中的虢国夫人，从史料碎片里还原出天宝时期的李杨之爱与安史旧事，以及唐代女性的日常生活图景。
天宝变局：无声胜有声的“从属者”
虢国夫人出于弘农杨氏，远祖为汉太尉杨震，是当时公认的名门望族，还与武则天的母族有远亲关系。按照关中高门之间的通婚之风，她嫁给河东裴氏。在三十岁之前，她没有因旧族门第、父祖的政治地位或夫君的官声在历史上留下太多痕迹。她的腾达是源于妹妹…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[作为一位 Linux 管理员，你需要跟踪所有用户的活动。当服务器发生故障时，你可以分析和查看用户活动，以便寻找问题的根源。监控 Linux 用户有多种方式。本指南将专门讨论 GNU 记账工具，这是一项用于监视 Linux 用户活动的实用工具。

什么是记账工具？

记账工具可以提供诸如 Linux 系统中的连接、已执行的程序以及系统资源的使用等有底系统使用信息。这些记账工具可以通过 psacct 或 acct 软件包安装。

psacct 和 acct 实际上是相同的。在基于 RPM 的系统中，它以 psacct 的形式存在；而在基于 DEB 的系统中，它作为 acct 提供。

你可能想知道 psacct 或 acct 工具的作用。通常，用户在命令行的历史记录会保存在他们的 $HOME 目录下的 .bash_history 文件中。有些用户可能会尝试编辑、修改或删除这些历史记录。

然而，即使他们完全 清除了命令行历史，记账工具依然能够获取用户活动信息。这是因为，所有进程记账文件都由 root 用户拥有，而普通用户则无法进行编辑。

Linux 中如何安装 psacct 或 acct

psacct/acct 被打包在多种流行的 Linux 发行版本中。

如果要在 Alpine Linux 中安装 psacct，请运行以下命令：

$ sudo apk add psacct


如果在 Arch Linux 及其变体版本（如 EndeavourOS 和 Manjaro Linux）中安装 acct，请运行以下命令：

$ sudo pacman -S acct


在 Fedora、RHEL 及其衍生版本（如 CentOS、AlmaLinux 和 Rocky Linux）中安装 psacct，请运行以下命令：

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[美国商务部就ECCN3A090更新高科技出口管制政策作出澄清，关于3A090b部分NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4090 显示卡的禁令，美国商务部允许就在出口消费性应用可申请作出豁免，因此可以在中国零售市场贩售。


GeForce RTX 4090显示卡可以在中国 (包括香港及澳门) 消费性市场作零售，但不可以输入RTX 4090 晶片作商用及生产用途，意味著中国代工厂不能生产Ge Force RTX 4090，但玩家还是能买到RTX 4090新卡。


在拜登政府更新针对人工智能（AI）芯片的出口管制规定后的次日，英伟达RTX4090显卡已在各大购物网站下架。目前，网购平台京东上13款RTX 4090显卡均显示“该商品已下柜”或“此商品暂时售完”，淘宝上各大旗舰店均显示“缺货”或已无该产品展示。


根据英伟达10月18日发布的公告，美国政府临时最终规则修订了ECCN 3A090和4A090，对向中国以及其他D1、D4、D5类国家和地区出口规定了额外的许可证要求，受限产品包括英伟达旗下超过某些性能阈值的芯片（包括但不限于：A100、A800、H100、H800、L40、L40S及RTX 4090），英伟达旗下计算平台NVIDIA DGX和HGX也包含在新的许可要求中。英伟达官网显示，RTX 40系列为游戏和娱乐分类下的性能最高的显卡，而并非用于AI或高性能运算的产品。


英伟达表示，公司第三季度报告期将于10月29日结束，该规则自公布之日起30天内生效，鉴于全球对公司产品需求持续旺盛，预计额外的出口限制不会在短期时间内对公司的业绩产生明显的影响。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A lot of devs I know are excited about Cloud Development Environments (CDEs) like GitHub Codespaces, Gitpod, Codeanywhere, Coder, Replit, and CodeSandbox. They seem great, and simplify many aspects of the dev workflow: easy to onboard onto new projects, everyone on the project stays in sync, etc.
But I rarely hear of actual teams using them; it's usually individuals using CDEs for side projects.
Are you using a CDE at work? Would love to hear about your experience.

There’s no ‘try it out’ link, primarily because (as most fintech devs know) there are compliance and regulatory thresholds that make it hard for us to give out sandbox keys freely. However, we’ve put together this video to show you the basics of how Pier works: https://www.loom.com/share/04883eb17f394b46a67cce919cb77356.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[10月18日晚间消息，据报道 ，来自供应链厂商的消息称，苹果公司正与供应商合作开发一款可折叠屏iPad平板电脑，最早将于2024年底小规模生产。这意味着，苹果可能在2024年底或2025年初发布这款产品。


去年就有报道称，苹果正在研发一款可折叠的iPad。而且，苹果也申请了相关专利。知名苹果分析师郭明錤今年年初也曾表示，苹果将在2024年推出可折叠屏iPad。


今日，来自供应链厂商的消息称，苹果正在推进该计划，正与供应商合作开发一款可折叠屏iPad，最早将于2024年底小规模生产。目前尚不清楚所谓的“小规模”到底有多大，但有迹象表明，要比试产规模大很多。


如果消息属实，意味着苹果可能会在2024年底或2025年初宣布推出折叠屏iPad，与分析师郭明錤之前的预期基本一致。郭明錤年初曾在推特上称：“我对苹果在2024年推出可折叠屏iPad持乐观态度。预计这款新机型将促进出货量，改善苹果的产品结构。”


在此之前，苹果的许多竞争对手都已推出了可折叠屏手机，而苹果则希望率先在其平板电脑上测试这项技术。研究公司CCS Insight称：“苹果将避开这一趋势，率先用可折叠iPad来试水。”


今年2月，苹果从美国专利与商标局（USPTO）获得了一项可折叠屏专利，燃起了人们对苹果推出可折叠屏设备的期望。


苹果在专利申请文件中展示了一件可以对折的设备，屏幕几乎环绕整个机身，该设备配备多个触摸传感器，甚至是机身的边缘。这将允许用户通过触摸设备的不同部位，来实现对应的功能。

《美国医疗的社会变迁》的作者、普林斯顿大学社会学与公共事务教授保罗·斯塔尔凭借丰富的二手史料，扎实地论证了美国医疗的兴衰。该书在美国一经出版，不仅将普利策奖收入囊中，更迎来了学界的强劲反响，分别获得美国历史学界的班克罗夫特奖、社会学界的赖特·米尔斯奖、美国医院管理者协会颁发的詹姆斯·汉密尔顿奖。此外，该书还得到医学界的强烈共鸣。根据调查，该书是医生书架上最常见的历史（或社会学）类书籍（Joel D. Howell, What the Doctors Read, Journal of Health Politics, Policy and Law, 2004, 29[4]: 781-797）。在该书出版二十周年之际，《卫生行政、政策和法律杂志》甚至专门组织一期特刊，邀请各个学界学者来重新评估该书的价值。
二十世纪下半叶，围绕医疗职业的社会学研究已经十分丰富，为什么《美国医疗的社会变迁》能在诸多著作中脱颖而出？我想答案在于这本书高度具体化的提问方式。有别于之前的两种研究取向，即定义职业和寻找职业化的标准路径，斯塔尔将美国医疗职业地位的历史变动视作核心问题，在挖掘了不同时期医疗职业特征的同时，阐明这一特征的生成过程。在此框架下，作者不再坚持单一线性叙事过程和将医疗职业假定为稳定且边界清晰的社会实体，而是呈现出历史特定时刻不同社会实体与医疗领域内部群体的互动过程，并且将其互动结果的产生作为每章回答的研究问题。在下文中，我将首先阐述英美医疗职业研究的学术脉络及其存在的缺陷，再以经验分析的前三章为例，呈现斯塔尔的提问方式如何做到将因果性聚集于历史叙事当中，进而弥补过去研究的不足。

上周之前，马自达汽车的车主如果同时安装了“Home Assistant”应用，就可以为自己的汽车创建一些方便的连接。比如根据能源的动态价格控制充电器；再比如还可以在早晨通勤前检查油量，在天气预报下雨前提醒他们车窗是否已关好，以及在寒冷条件下远程解锁和启动汽车等等。这些功能可以扩展的范围非常大，据称已经超出了马自达官方应用程序的功能范围。然而，马自达向 GitHub 发出了下架该仓库的要求，指控该软件包含 “侵犯版权所有权” 的代码；使用 “某些马自达信息，包括专有 API 信息来创建代码和信息”；包含提供与目前马自达应用程序中“相同功能”的代码。该软件作者出于“即使我相信我所做的事情在道德上是正确的，在法律上是受保护的，但法律程序仍然需要付出经济代价”的考虑，向“Home Assistant”核心项目提出了拉取请求，删除了马自达集成。

高通发布首款面向大众市场的 RISC-V 安卓 SoC

去年，谷歌宣布在安卓系统中正式支持 RISC-V，并计划将其打造成与 Arm 同等重要的一级平台。而在硬件方面，高通宣布推出有史以来第一款面向大众市场的 RISC-V 安卓 SoC，它计划 “在全球（包括美国）商业化基于 RISC-V 的可穿戴设备解决方案”。RISC-V 架构是开源的，因此比 Arm 架构更便宜、更灵活，也是回避 Arm 存在的各种问题的一种方法。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[缺少了 GNOME 中的最小化按钮选项？下面教你如何轻松找回它。


与 Ubuntu 不同，Fedora 和 Arch Linux 等发行版为你提供了原生的 GNOME，但可能让你烦恼的一件事是应用窗口上缺少最小化和最大化按钮。



GNOME 希望你使用应用切换器（Alt+Tab）或使用活动区（Super 键）在正在运行的应用之间切换，而不是最小化它。

好消息是，如果你不喜欢的话，你不必这样。

让我分享一下如何使用 GUI 和命令行选项恢复 GNOME 中的最小化和最大化按钮。

方法 1：使用 GNOME 优化工具启用最小化和最大化按钮

GNOME 优化Tweaks 工具允许你自定义 GNOME 的各个方面。启用最小化窗口按钮就是其中之一。

首先使用发行版的包管理器安装 GNOME 优化工具。

运行应用并从左侧边栏进入 Windows 标题栏。你将在此处看到添加最小化和最大化按钮的选项，



你可以选择其中一个或两者。如果你不再需要它，你可以在 GNOME 调整工具中以相同的方式禁用按钮。


💡 如果需要，你还可以选择将这些控制按钮放在左侧。该选项位于标题栏按钮选项的末尾。


方法 2：使用命令行启用最小化和最大化按钮

gsettings 命令可以选择更改按钮布局并添加最小化和最大化按钮。

gsettings set org.gnome.desktop.wm.preferences button-layout ":minimize,maximize,close"


正如你所猜测的，如果你想要禁用任何按钮，你可以运行相同的命令，但从命令中省略不需要的按钮。


💡 你还可以通过将冒号放在命令的右侧来将 Windows 控制按钮移动到左侧：

gsettings set org.gnome.desktop.wm.preferences button-layout "close,minimize,maximize:"



受到 macOS 的启发并不总是一件好事

显然，这种“无最小化按钮”的设计灵感来自苹果的 macOS。我记得大约 10 年前，macOS 曾经将窗口控件放在左侧。因此 Ubuntu Unity 也尝试默认将控件保留在左侧。

苹果很奇怪。他们大多数时候都有很好的设计，但有时他们会优先考虑设计而不是使用体验。“Magic Mouse” 就是一个例子。


“Magic Mouse 深受用户喜爱”。你确定？ 



— Stuart (@stuwieface) 2021 年 4 月 20 日


我不明白为什么 GNOME 开发者需要从各种设计中获得灵感，尤其是那些糟糕的设计。

但那只是我的个人意见。我很高兴有一个快速简单的解决方案可以恢复 GNOME 中的最小化和最大化按钮。

 Neptune works on Linux (X11/Wayland), Windows, MacOs (supported but untested), Bsd (untested).
 Neptune works on CLI (has systray to start/stop/randomize/exit) and also has a GUI interface if you prefer it (also has systray) .
 Neptune has a wide variety of keysounds to choose from (see photo). You can also create your own keysounds and it does not require any configurations. Matter of a fact you can use Neptune to create a piano keyboard if want to.
 Neptune supports Key-events resembling a real-life realistic experience that you can use to play a sound upon pressing and releasing a key.

 As a result, I've joined a bunch of subs and taken a bit more of an interest in DE and GUI subjects that previously didn't interest me.
 I find an awful lot of posts talking about issues with Wayland, but not found any reason to switch from X, which seems mature and essentially un-problematic. 
 Am I missing something?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So, degoogled Android is one thing, but what about taking existing proprietary drivers and just throwing KDE mobile on top of it with Wayland?
 Alternatively, Qualcomm only recently has truly developed "consumer ready" compatibility with Windows. I do wonder if Qualcomm might benefit from using FOSS support to develop kernels compatible with both Windows and Android natively. Is it within the realm of possibility to run collaborations with Qualcomm at a corporate level to get help developing kernels in tandem with propriety userland drivers, that are OS-agnostic and thus interoperable with Windows, Android and Linux?
 What, exactly, is the most severe bottleneck in mobile linux development? Proprietary drivers for Snapdragon SOCs? Limited corporate support? Lack of interest from talented coders?

 And also, some snaps and flatpaks arnt uploaded by their publisher, so so you trust them?
 I wish there was one, cross platform repository we could access and all Linux publishers could upload to. But I guess the open, none centralized nature of the Linux world probably means it won't ever happen. 
 Which of the systems, flatpak, snaps, app images do you guys generally find best supported by the apps you mostly use?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[观察你的代码在其他解释器下运行的表现或许是一项有趣的尝试。


作为最受欢迎的编程语言之一，Python 需要一个解释器来执行其代码所定义的命令。与其他可直接编译成机器代码的语言不同，Python 代码需要解释器读取它并把它转译给进行相关操作的 CPU。那么，哪些解释器有哪些呢？本文将对其中几种进行介绍。

解释器简介

提到 Python 解释器，我们通常会想到 /usr/bin/python 这个二进制文件。它使你能够执行 .py 文件。然而，解释操作仅仅是其中一环。在 Python 代码真正被 CPU 执行之前，都需要经过以下四个步骤：


词法分析 - 将人类编写的源代码转换为一序列逻辑实体，被称为 词法标记lexical token。

解析 - 解析器会检查词法标记的语法和语义规则生成 抽象语法树abstract syntax tree（AST）。

编译 - 编译器会根据 AST 创建 Python 字节码，这些字节码由非常基础的，和平台无关的指令组成。

解释 - 解释器处理字节码并执行特定的操作。


如你所见，在任何实质性的操作发生之前，我们需要走过这些步骤。这也解释了深入研究不同解释器的重要性。

1、CPython

作为 Python 的参考实现，CPython 默认地被许多系统所采用。如其名称所示，CPython 是用 C 语言编写的。这也意味着，我们可以 以 C 语言编写扩展，从而让 Python 打通到广泛使用的 C 语言库代码。CPython 广泛应用于各种平台，包括 ARM 和 RISC。然而，作为 Python 的参考实现，CPython 更注重精细的优化，而非运行速度。

2、Pyston

Pyston 是一个从 CPython 解释器衍生出的分支，其中实现了性能优化。该项目定位自己为标准 CPytho…]]></summary>

sequences (sometimes referred to as "RSEQ") since 2018, but it remains
a bit of a niche feature, mostly useful to performance-oriented developers
who do not mind writing assembly code.  According to Mathieu Desnoyers, the developer
behind the kernel's implementation of restartable sequences, this feature
can be applicable to a much wider range of performance-sensitive code with
proper library support.  He came to the 2023 GNU Tools Cauldron to
present the case for use of restartable sequences within the GNU C Library
(glibc).]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[10月17日，“讯飞员工因提前一小时抢老乡鸡免费套餐被罚”的话题在社交媒体广受关注。有自媒体爆料称，科大讯飞就老乡鸡免费午餐活动中的员工排队事件发布了声明。


声明内容显示，在10月8日老乡鸡开展的免费午餐活动中，科大讯飞A4美食街老乡鸡餐厅的门口出现了10点30分左右即有员工开始排队的情况，时至11时许，排队人数已达百余人，且此后排队人员持续增加。


科大讯飞在声明中称，公司午餐及休息时间为12:00-13:00，上述员工在距离午餐时间一个小时以上即开始离岗排队等待的行为，已明确违反了相关规定，属主观消极怠工行为。


科大讯飞声明，将在相关人员信息确认后，依据规定进行处理。具体处理方案为：正编员工将进行当面谈话、予以书面警告且当季度绩效考核结果不得高于C；外包员工将与相应外包公司沟通，视严重程度作警告或人员汰换等处理。11点30分后参与排队的人员暂不做处理。


10月17日，一位科大讯飞员工确认，科大讯飞的所有员工都可以看到上述声明。


同日上午，九派财经向涉事门店老乡鸡（合肥科大讯飞店）了解到，该店铺不对外开放，到店顾客一般都是科大讯飞的工作人员。10月8日的免费午餐活动中，从10点半开始，确实有人在门口等待，但数量不多。


对于科大讯飞的声明，该门店员工称，是活动影响到了科大讯飞的员工，导致他们被惩罚。

I've seen many videos discussing Ubuntu being a terrible system created by a company trying to control the Linux space, and I just rolled with it. Now I've been running it for a few days and I couldn't be happier! I actually like Snaps as their installation is simpler than with flatpaks, and your config is stored in $HOME/snap. With flatpak I always have to search up where the hell is it. Their GNOME implementation is definitely one of the best I've ever seen, especially the accent collors picker and the inclusion of tray icons. Oh yeah, Ubuntu Pro makes your system supported until 2032. Even if my drive will definitely fail sooner than the support ends, the peace of mind it gives me is comforting. 
 TLDR: I've found a new distro home and my prejudice against Ubuntu got shattered

木心曾这样评价勃朗特姐妹：“自然环境影响了她们的气质和文学风格……三姐妹在约克郡一直写到死，真正做到了生活和艺术的一元。”他认为，“《简·爱》还是好。一是情操崇高，二是适合年轻人读，是爱情的好的教科书……《呼啸山庄》适合老年人读”（木心：《文学回忆录》，上海三联书店，2020年，534页）。对于伍尔夫瞧不上《简·爱》，他颇为之愤愤。“自然环境”，是那个很长时间里被人有意或无意地误会为远离文明世界的家庭所在地，那个听地名就似乎注定会产生《呼啸山庄》的约克郡荒原。“一直写到死，真正做到了生活与艺术的一元”的三姐妹，二姐艾米莉因肺结核逝世，仅三十岁，次年，比她小一岁的妹妹安妮因为同样的原因逝世，两人一生未婚；最大的姐姐夏洛蒂在与父亲的助理牧师阿瑟·贝尔·尼科尔斯结婚后不久，因妊娠并发症下世，仅三十九岁。三姐妹在留下那些老少皆宜的经典之后，陆续离世，夏洛蒂留下了翔实的生平记载，而在离世前，“却在妹妹们辞世后毁掉了她们的书信和其他作品”（第7页）。于此，三姐妹、时代、作品三者之间，留下了巨大的空白，这大片的空白为传记性演绎提供了可能。
传记这一文体本质上有反虚构的艺术要求，却一直且不得不与虚构共存，后者包括传记作者有意识或无意识的选择——材料的筛选、情感的偏向、时代作用于作者的力量等等。传记是民族认同过程中不可或缺的一部分，一直承担着教育职能。然而在它生成过程中，或多或少有不同社会力量的参与，它不可能完全复原传主，只是将这个对象在新的历史条件下重新糅合，呈现给当下人。传记的这种不可靠性，对应勃朗特三姐妹所遗留的巨大空白，逐步造就了英国文学史和文化史上不可忽视的“迷思”。
米勒在《勃朗特迷思》的导言中明确表示，“这本书既是对勃朗特三姐妹的批评，也是对传记艺术…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[在这篇初学者教程中，学习在 Arch Linux 中安装 Brave 浏览器。


Firefox 和 Brave 是我日常浏览网页的程序。

当我安装带有 GNOME 的 Arch Linux 时，它有 GNOME Web 浏览器。这是一个不错的浏览器，但我不能接受它，因为我需要保存的密码、浏览历史记录和插件。

因此，我开始安装我最喜欢的网络浏览器，因此本教程是关于在 Arch Linux 中安装 Brave。

如果你安装了 Yay（或任何其他 AUR 帮助程序），那么安装 Brave 就像使用以下命令一样简单：

yay -S brave-bin


是的！就这么简单。让我们详细看看。


💡 Manjaro 内置了 AUR 支持。你可以使用 Pamac 软件中心或 pamac/pacman 命令在 Manjaro 中安装 Brave。


在 Arch Linux 上安装 Brave 浏览器

Brave 在官方 Arch 仓库中不可用。但是，它可以在 AUR（Arch 用户仓库）中使用，并且可以使用 Yay 等 AUR 帮助程序轻松安装。

如果你没有 Yay 或任何其他 AUR 帮助程序，请逐一使用这些命令来 安装 Yay：

sudo pacman -S --needed base-devel git
git clone https://aur.archlinux.org/yay.git
cd yay
makepkg -si


安装 Yay 后，用它来安装 Brave：

yay -S brave-bin


不用担心。它最终会要求你输入密码。

如果这是你第一次安装浏览器，系统可能会要求你选择字体提供方。使用默认选择或选择任何其他选项。



接下来，它会询问你有关清理构建的问题。Yay 询问你是否应该重新下载软件包（和依赖项）并再次构建它或使用早期构建的缓存（如果有）。

你可以按回车键继续操作，这应该意味着不清理构建。



事实上，当你看到默认选项时，你可以继续按回车键。

在实际安装之前，系统会要求你输入帐户密码。输入你的密码并继续该过程。它将下载大小约为 350 MB 的文件：



安装后，在系统菜单中查找 Brave browser 并从那里运行它。



保持 Brave 更新

你可以使用以下命令更新通过 Yay 安装的 AUR 软件包来保持 Brave 浏览器更新：

yay -Sua


从 Arch 中删除 Brave

不喜欢 Brave？ 不用担心。你可以轻松将其删除。

与任何其他软件一样，使用 pacman 命令从 Arch 中删除 Brave：

sudo pacman -Rs brave-bin


总结

AUR 再次拯救你！ 安装 Brave 变得非常简单。

顺便说一句，我注意到 Brave 不知何故成为打开图像的默认应用。这意味着，双击图像将在新的 Brave 窗口中打开它们。

我必须通过右键单击图像并选择“打开方式”选项再次将图像查看器设置为默认值。



在接下来的几天里，我将分享更多我的 Arch 经验。敬请关注！

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[创作者们，Ubuntu Studio 23.10 来了！它包含了你开始创作旅程所需的一切。


Ubuntu 的新版本如同雨后的春笋般持续涌现！☔ 其中一款新版本就是 Ubuntu Studio 23.10，它带来了一些实用的更新和改进。

下面就让我们详细了解一下它。


💡 Ubuntu Studio 23.10 将会提供九个月的支持，直到 2024 年 7 月。


🆕 Ubuntu Studio 23.04: 新增了哪些特性？



对于那些刚接触的朋友，Ubuntu Studio 是针对 内容创作者特制的官方 Ubuntu 发行版。

Ubuntu Studio 预装了许多在音频/视频制作、摄影、网络直播、图形设计等多种领域中使用的应用程序。

KDE Plasma 的升级提升

全新壁纸

更新的应用套件

Linux 内核升级到 6.5 版本

安装程序中加入的音频配置工具


KDE Plasma 的升级提升



Ubuntu Studio 23.10 带有新的 KDE Plasma 5.27.8 桌面环境，以及新的翻译、各种修复，和三个关键的问题修复：

Linux 内核升级至 6.5 版本



所有的这些，全都运行在Linux 内核 6.5之上，让 Ubuntu Studio 23.10 能够支持如 USB4/Wi-Fi 7 的初始支持和AMD 的各种优化等。

🛠️ 其他的改进

此外，还有一些你应该了解的改变:


由于引入了 0.3.79 版本，提升了 PipeWire 的性能。

Ubuntu Studio 的安装程序已去掉了 Backports PPA 的选项。

将 Carla 升级到了 2.5.6版。


你可以访问 官方发布说明 以了解关于升级和技术变动的更多细节。

📥 下载 Ubuntu Studio 23.10

你可以在 官方网站 或者 Ubuntu 的 镜像仓库 中下载到最新的Ubuntu Studio版本。

 I've added some subcommands to aid in exploring files. By default both commands load only the first 20,000 rows of data, if possible. Some formats like Parquet don't allow that. 
 The reports that it generates are markdown. If anyone has any other ideas for other statistics to include please open a request.
 pip install xklb pandas 
 If you want to load data from AWS S3 you also need s3fs

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[10月16日晚，胡锡进发微博支持大V前台实名制落地，胡锡进称早在7月份就曾提出这个建议，并表示这个前台实名对于普通网民不受影响，不会影响网上言论自由。


以下为胡锡进微博全文：



看来大V前台实名制终于就要落地了，老胡对此完全赞成。


老胡今年7月份发帖写道：“提个建议，各平台粉丝100万以上的大V都应实名。无论尚义江湖，还是崇法社会，实名论道或厮杀，都应是规矩。”今天老胡坚持自己当时的主张。


据称，这次推行大V前台实名，针对的是时政、财经和娱乐领域的大V，而以个人日常生活分享为主的领域账号不在其列，普通网民更不受影响，我认为这是公正的。


时政、财经和娱乐领域是非最多，对社会的牵动力也都比较大，大V发言带节奏，理应让公众了解他们的真实身份。这不仅是每个观点所应补充的背景信息，也是大V对所发言论负责的动力，“马甲”是应当被平等去除的保护。


一个大V在互联网上发言，公众应当知道他是谁，他周围的人则应当知道他在互联网上说了什么。把这个规则确立下来，我相信不会成为大V们正当发表言论的特殊障碍，相反，它只会提升互联网舆论场的真实质量。


因为后台实名早就施行了，哪个大V说了什么，平台和政府都能随时找到他，前台匿名实为对网民的隐瞒。言论自由通常指的是对公权力的防范，而非面向大众舆论场的特殊保护。根据这些年网络的实际情况，允许“从暗处开枪”讨论热点公共事件并且带节奏，对我们舆论场的健康显然弊大于利。



微评：我觉得，网络大V的前台实名，键政圈里面最大受益者应该就是胡锡进，胡锡进肯定应该举双手双脚去支持。]]></summary>

Sonatype 的《年度软件供应链分析报告》发现，开源项目的维护率在下降。在对 117 万个开源项目进行了评估后，报告显示今年仅有 11% 的项目在积极维护，比去年下降了 18%。调查主要涉及四个生态系统：通过 NPM 维护的 JavaScript、通过 Maven 维护的 Java、通过 PyPI 维护的 Python 和通过 NuGet 维护的 .NET，此外还包括一些 Go 项目。此外，报告还发现，67% 的受访者表示，他们不认为自己的应用程序依赖于已知的漏洞库；39% 的组织在一到七天内发现漏洞；39% 的企业需要一周以上的时间来缓解漏洞；每 8 次开放源代码下载中就有 1 次存在已知风险，但 96% 的漏洞下载版本都有可用的修复版本。

谷歌人工智能 “绿灯计划” 加速交通、降低油耗和碳排放

谷歌的 “绿灯计划”通过对地图数据的机器学习来优化绿灯时间，减少车辆的空转时间以及刹车和加速次数。谷歌 2021 年首次在四个十字路口进行了试点测试，测试中观察到燃料和十字路口延迟时间减少了 10% 到 20%。谷歌称，“早期的数据显示，我们有可能减少 30% 的停车位，……在曼彻斯特测试的排放水平和空气质量提高了 18%，……帮助减少了 240 多万吨碳排放，相当于一整年减少了约 50 万辆燃油汽车”。

老王点评：这就是智慧交通该做的事情，随着车机联网普及，会有更智能的交通管理。

20 多年来，各种版本的 Windows 一直使用 Kerberos 作为主要的身份验证协议。不过，在某些情况下，操作系统必须使用另一种方法，即 NTLM（NT LAN 管理器）。NTLM 的优点是因为它不需要本地网络连接到域控制器，它也是使用本地账户时唯一受支持的协议。这些优点导致一些应用程序和服务硬编码使用 NTLM。但 Kerberos 提供了更好的安全保证，而且可扩展性更强，这也是它现在成为 Windows 首选默认协议的原因。今天，微软宣布将扩大 Kerberos 的使用范围，并计划最终完全放弃使用 NTLM，微软将其称为 “Windows 身份验证的进化”。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ardour 8.0 这个重大升级为我们带来了对新硬件的支持，完善的自动化创建流程等。


Ardour 作为最好的 Linux 数字音频工作站（DAW） 之一，允许音频专业人士进行包括创建、录音、混音音乐和其他各类音频的各种工作。

这一次，我们迎来了这款 DAW 的重大升级。 Ardour 8.0 的发布距离它的 7.0 发布 近一年，不过这还是它发展历程中的一次显著进步。

下面就让我们来详细探讨一下它都带来了哪些新的变化。

🆕 Ardour 8.0: 有哪些新功能？



Ardour 8.0 版本承诺提供丰富的新特性以及大量的修复。

而且，开发者在此次发布时也特别强调，Ardour 的会话文件格式没有发生改变，这就意味着，所有在之前 7.x 版本的 Ardour 创建的会话在加载时都不会出现问题。

以下是一些主要亮点：


支持 Novation Launchpad Pro

MIDI 音轨头部进行了全新设计

MIDI 动力性的提高

支持区域分组功能

macOS 的公证服务


支持 Novation Launchpad Pro



Ardour 8.0 版本的增加了对 Novation 公司发售的 Launchpad Pro 的支持，它是一款电子乐器，包括一个 8×8 格的 RGB，可以检测力度的触摸垫，可以完成各种各样的任务。

对于 Ardour 来说，它可以用于 触发音频切片和线索、控制音频增益水平、操作声音平移 甚至 设置音轨/总线的水平。

MIDI 音轨头部全新设计



全新设计的 MIDI 音轨头 带来了一些引人注目的变化，最值得注意的包括：


八度音符如 C3、C4 将会永久显示。

可以通过钢琴卷动键来记录 MIDI。

滚动+缩放scroomer 功能的直观设计。

在 滚动+缩放scroomer 功能中可以显示音符名称，可以使用 MIDNAM 数据，泛用音符编号或 12TET 名。


MIDI 动力学的改进

在一直以来的用户需求驱动下，Ardour 的开发者终于新增了一款 传统的 动力棒棒糖velocity lollipop界面。

这个界面由带有顶部圆点的垂直横条组成，可以用这个横条调节音符力度。我建议你可以在上面的视频中了解更多关于这个在 Ardour 8.0 版本中实施的一项功能。

支持区域分组功能



这也是用户长期以来的一项需求。区域分组 提供了一个选取多个 区域 并将它们组合成一个单一元素的功能。

这个功能可以赋予你将多个元素整合移动/剪辑的能力，减少对每个元素重复操作的需要。

macOS 验证

当你在苹果电脑上安装第三方软件时，计算机会警告你该软件可能会对你的系统产生损害或含有恶意软件，当然，对于用户而言，这可能是一个糟糕的用户体验，他们可能不会尝试运行它。

为了改善用户体验，Ardour 决定参加并支付一个苹果开发者账户以使用它的验证系统 Notarization。

因此，下次当你在 macOS 上安装 Ardour 时，你会看到软件已经被苹果检查/验证没有携带恶意软件，这会让用户对 Ardour 有更多的信心。

🛠️ 其它的改变

最后，以下还有一些其他带来的改变：


支持自由手绘自动化曲线。

新增了三个新的 MIDI 算法插件。

集成有序排列组成特性的专专用标尺。

BBT 标记提供了多项提升。


你也可以查看 官方发布说明 来更多地了解这次发布的信息。

📥 下载 Ardour 8.0

由于 Ardour 是一个跨平台的应用程序，你可以在它的 官方网站 上找到适用于 Linux、Windows 和 macOS 的软件包。

如果你对源代码感兴趣，你也可以查看它的 GitHub 仓库。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[一
1929年1月4日，旧历十一月二十四日，郭曾炘在北京病逝。其子郭则澐请陈宝琛为撰墓志铭，即收于《沧趣楼文存》卷下的《郭文安公墓志铭》（上海古籍出版社《沧趣楼诗文集》，下册，412-415页）。作为研究郭曾炘生平的重要资料，这篇文章却并非出自陈宝琛之手，而是由何振岱代笔。《何振岱集》收录《侯官郭文安公墓志铭》，题下小字注“代”。何振岱（1867-1952），字梅生，号觉庐，晚号梅叟，和陈宝琛、郭曾炘同为福建人。有《我春室文集》《觉庐诗集》等。2016年，福建人民出版社影印出版《何振岱日记》，民国二十九年（1940）十一月十六日：
郭舜卿使人送春老墓志拓本，宝侍郎书，楷法端严，得欧阳率更之神。文则弢老撰，而予代笔也。尚觉整洁不芜，铭词尤雅赡。
春老即郭曾炘（春榆）。郭则寿（1883-1943），号舜卿，有《卧虎阁诗》，何振岱为作序。郭舜卿是郭柏苍曾孙，郭曾炘的祖父是郭柏荫，郭柏荫是郭阶三的次子，郭柏苍是第四子。此时距离郭曾炘去世已经过去十年。郭曾炘曾为礼部侍郎，民国后，居于北京。1925年，陈宝琛从北京迁居天津，仍往来频繁。1928年，郭曾炘为陈宝琛的弟弟、陈懋鼎的父亲陈宝瑨撰寿文。垂暮之年，郭曾炘开始手定诗作拟刊行，请陈宝琛为诗集作序。宝侍郎即宝熙，在宗室中诗文、书法皆有美名。何振岱对自己的这篇文章甚为满意，如果没有日记的记载，很难知道这篇《墓志铭》非陈宝琛的手笔。

陈宝琛为近代诗文大家，有《沧趣楼诗集》《沧趣楼文存》存世。《沧趣楼诗集》刊行之前，曾经师友反复审定，足见慎重。然《沧趣楼文存》二卷，并非陈宝琛生前自定。陈遵统《〈沧趣楼文存〉校读后记》：“兹集辑成后，幾士以付陈君无竞，无竞于庚寅春校雠竣事，缀以短跋。旋复由几士托胡君孟玺珍藏，以俟刊布。”1950年春，陈海瀛校雠后交还陈懋复，由胡尔瑛（孟玺）珍藏，胡为林纾弟子，辑有《畏庐尺牍》。陈之麟《沧趣楼文存跋》称“《文…]]></summary>

 So my day program recently got three new computers. Unfortunately, rather than put Windows 11 on them, they put this thing called Porteus Kiosk on it instead. 
 Needless to say, I'm not impressed with it one bit. Chrome runs absolutely horrible on it. I watched our tech admin install it and he told me we had to have Porteus over Windows because of security reasons.
 What are y'all's thoughts on it?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[这篇文章会探讨什么是 Btrfs 快照，它们如何工作的，你在日常生活中进行快照的好处。这篇文章是《Btrfs 详解》系列文章中的一篇。从 Fedora Linux 33 开始，Btrfs 就是 Fedora Workstation 和 Fedora Silverblue 的默认文件系统。

如果你错过了，这里是本系列的上一篇文章：Btrfs 详解：子卷

简介

想象一下，你长时间处理一个文件，反复添加和撤销修改。然后，在某个时刻你意识到：两小时前你撤销的部分修改，现在会非常有用。而昨天在你销毁那个设计之前，你也已经修改了这个特殊的部分。当然，由于你会定期保存文件，所以旧的改动会丢失。很多人可能都遇到过这样的情况。如果能恢复旧版本的文件，而无需定期手动复制，岂不美哉？

这是一个 Btrfs 快照可以帮助你的特别场景。当你使用正确的话，快照同时也为你的电脑提供了很好的备份方案。

下面你会找到一些关于快照的例子。如果你想跟着操作，你必须拥有访问某些 Btrfs 文件系统的权限和 root 权限。你可以通过下面命令来验证一个目录的文件系统。

$ findmnt -no FSTYPE /home
btrfs


这个命令会输出你 /home/ 目录的文件系统名称。如果它是 btrfs，那就可以了。让我们创建一个新的目录去做实验：

$ mkdir ~/btrfs-snapshot-test
$ cd ~/btrfs-snapshot-test


在下面的文本中，你会看到很多像上面显示的那样的命令输出框。请在阅读/比较命令输出时请记住，框中的内容在行末会被换行。这使得识别跨多行的长行变得困难，降低了可读性。如果有疑问，试着调整浏览器窗口的大小，看看文本的变化！

 I am a C lover. This language is simply the best language to exist for me. So obviously as I learned more about Wayland I decided to write a compositor for personal use. Keep in mind I already had an X11 window manager already written but didn't really use it. Anyways, I decide to start researching documentation, tutorials, manpages, anything.
 And here goes the first flaw: Wayland lacks documentation. Very often you don't know what a struct or a function do, you just have to guess by the name. And programmers suck at naming stuff, like scientists and maybe chemists.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[在以往，传统的互联网匿名交往具有身份隐蔽性和低成本性，也就助长了网民无惧妄为的心理，易导致谣言、网暴、侵权等问题产生。在此背景下，网络实名制应运而生，即要求互联网信息服务使用者通过真实身份信息认证后注册账号，在其所使用的网络平台进行“后台实名”，也就是说用户个人信息只有后台相关的管理人员可见，否则不得跟帖评论、发布信息以及使用软件，而在网页端/前端显示的依然可以是昵称，网民一旦触犯法律，可以通过与网民相关联的实名追踪到行为人，有利于降低追责成本。这也被称为“后台实名、前台自愿”制。


实施多年，“后台实名、前台自愿”制受到广大网民的认同，并且也在净化网络环境、维护网络安全、构建诚信互联网体系和网络管理等方面取得不错的效果。


去年，网络IP归属地的开放让“网络实名制”再次出现在大众视野。互联网平台纷纷增加了显示IP地址的功能，不管是发布信息、评论，还是自媒体账号的个人主页界面，都会显示本地的IP地址。从简单的实名制注册到如今的IP实时动态监测，让更多的“键盘侠”都缩起了手，毕竟后台实名允许用户以匿名形式发布信息，比如造谣、网暴，一般网友难以查证，出现了一些肆无忌惮的“键盘侠”，显示IP地址会对这类用户起到威慑作用。


在公布IP归属地政策发布后，便有网友表示，这可能是网络前台实名制的开始。其认为，在前台展示IP地址，比以前可以完全匿名的要求提高了，不排除未来要求一些平台完全实名化，也就是前台实名发言，或者具备一定资质才能发言评论。


而在该帖下方，出现了一则很新的评论：“被你说对了呢，现在微博就要前台实名了”。怎么回事呢？


就在近日，自媒体大V透露即将实行“前台实名制”，引发舆论关注。


10月13日，一位微博大V发帖称，“全网自媒体要实施前台实名制了，就是大V的真实姓名要在一级页前端展示。”


次日，其对此补充道：“10月底之前，100万粉丝的自媒体账号前台展示真实姓名；12月份，50万粉的自媒体账号前台展示真实姓名；10万粉的自媒体账号，在后台完成身份证实名认证，且在前台展示职业信息 。”


随后，该消息得到数位微博大V的确认。微博大V“拆台CT”称，平台方曾征求其对于类似规定的意见。


但该大V同时表示，前台实名制并非平台方的决定，“据我所知，包括微博在内，几家大的平台也向上传递过上述担忧。但很遗憾的是，最终还是要落地。”


与此同时，“前台实名”等相关话题冲上微博热搜。网友看法不一。


一部分网友表示支持，认为这样可以加强自媒体管理，推进网络舆论生态治理。毕竟现在正处全民皆可自媒体时代，但门槛低带来的问题也很明显，以造谣传谣、假冒仿冒、违规营利等为典型的自媒体乱象普遍存在。只有把方方面面的监督、管理充分聚集起来，数以千万计的“眼睛”盯住各大网络平台的自媒体，让他们不能兴风作浪。


前台实名一旦上线确实可以破解很多监管难题，但也会让部分网友陷入担忧。不少网友表示担心被“开盒”被人肉网暴更容易了。一些职业或者身份特殊的大V，恐怕从此不再敢发声，或者不再说一些‘虽然真实，但容易引起争议’的话。


据悉，此次前台实名制是上级部门为落实“自媒体管控13条”而采取的一项行动。


2023年7月10日，中央网信办发布了《关于加强“自媒体”管理的通知》。新规从强加资质认证、加强谣言管理、规范账号运营等 13 个方面入手，以加强对“自媒体”领域的管控。


值得注意的是，据已收到通知的大V表示，这事儿跟平台绝大多数用户（＞99.9%）都没直接关系，此次要求全网平台部分领域的大V前台实名制，主要是时政、娱乐和财经等领域的大V必须前台实名。


那么这个大V是怎么定义的呢？


据微博CEO@来去之间 表示，只看粉丝数。也就是说，政策实施后哪怕是取消 V 认证也要在前台显示姓名。


前台实名制实施后，因为担心政策风险，已经有部分粉丝数不低的网友进行了销号“跑路”，未来可能会有相当一部分网友不再使用社交、论坛等互联网平台，对于平台的活跃度产生一定影响。人们将迎来互联网时代最严监管。


至于部分网民担心的前台实名制会导致个人信息更容易被曝光，被人肉搜索等，其实也不必过度恐慌，如若要实施前台实名制，肯定有相关管理细则出台。再者，网暴、恶意攻击、人肉搜索等皆为违法行为，皆可定罪。


并且，@来去之间 已证实，并不会出现每个网民都被要求前台实名的情况，只有有“媒体影响力”的用户需要实名，且辟谣了未来一万粉丝也会前台实名的传言，其表示未来最多到50万；如果是普通上网冲浪，还是沿用之前的后台实名。

据报道，中国最新研制的“九章三号”量子计算机在百万分之一秒内解决了一个超复杂的数学问题，而世界上最快的超级计算机 Frontier 完成同样任务需要 200 多亿年。九章系列量子计算机使用光子作为计算的物理介质，每个光子携带一个量子比特。《物理评论快报》周二发表的一篇论文称，在九章系列量子计算机中，前两代的光子数量分别为 76 个、113 个，在最新的“九章三号”中增加到了 255 个。“九章三号” 原型机还打破了该系列前代产品创下的记录，计算速度提高了一百万倍。

Firefox 即将默认启用原生 Wayland 后端

虽然 Fedora 和 Arch 等 Linux 发行版在默认情况下为 Firefox 启用了原生 Wayland 后端，但上游的 Firefox 仍然没有在其官方版本中启用 Wayland 支持。目前官方版本的 Firefox 是通过 XWayland 来支持 Wayland 环境，但这种情况有望很快改变，Firefox 上游版本即将在不久支持原生 Wayland。Mozilla 正在将他们的测试套件迁移到 Ubuntu 22.04 LTS 上运行，其中包括 Wayland 测试。

老王点评：是迁移到 Wayland 困难，还是 Mozilla 投入的人力不够呢？




微软写字板可被用来劫持易受攻击的系统

微软写字板中存在一个信息泄露漏洞，可被利用来窃取 NTLM 哈希值。微软表示，有两种方法可以利用这一漏洞。一种方法是以受攻击用户的身份登录，然后运行一个特制的应用程序，利用该漏洞控制受影响的系统。另一种方法是诱骗受害者打开恶意文件。攻击者必须说服用户点击一个链接，通常是通过电子邮件或即时信息中的诱导链接，然后说服用户打开特制文件。

老王点评：都 2023 年了，写字板居然还是一个安全漏洞。]]></summary>

陈寅恪有言：“自昔长于金石之学者，必为深研经史之人。非通经无以释金文，非治史无以证石刻。群经诸史，乃古史资料多数之所汇集，金文石刻则其少数脱离之片段。未有不了解多数汇集之资料，而能考释少数脱离之片段不误者。”作为一种“少数脱离之片段”，长期以来，石刻文献在文史研究中一直处于证史、补史的位置，研究视角与方法较为固化。
南京大学古典文献研究所所长、南京大学文学院教授程章灿多年来致力于中国古代文学、古典文献学研究，于石刻文献研究用力尤深，出版有《魏晋南北朝赋史》（江苏古籍出版社，1992）、《石刻刻工研究》（上海古籍出版社，2008）、《古刻新诠》（中华书局，2009）、《走近古典的过程》（广东高等教育出版社，2022）等专著。
最近，程章灿教授新著《作为物质文化的石刻文献》作为国家“十三五”重点图书规划项目《中国古代文献文化史》丛书之一种由南京大学出版社出版，从物质文化的角度重新考察中国古代的石刻文献，呈现出与以往石刻研究大不相同的面貌。《上海书评》邀请南京大学文学院副教授于溯与程章灿先生就相关话题作了一次对谈。

《作为物质文化的石刻文献》，程章灿著，南京大学出版社2023年5月出版，492页，150.00元

您这本著作和一般石刻研究专著的最大不同，是强调从物质文化角度去看中国古代石刻。可以谈谈选择这样一个视角的原因吗？
程章灿：我1989年博士毕业到南京大学古典文献研究所工作之后，很大一部分的学术精力就放在石刻研究上面。到2010年年底，我们申请到国家社科基金重大项目“中国古代文献文化史”，中间有二十来年了。我此前的石刻研究，基本可以分为两个层面。第一个层面我称之为史料的研究，是一篇一篇的考证文章，通过石刻文献与传世文献的对比，来做一些史料辨析工作。传统的石刻研究很多都是如此。第二个层面是史学的研究，把若干石刻文献集中在一起，对同类的问题进行一些处理…]]></summary>

It's been a rolling distro for a long time, and the developers have ways of making it easy to fix if a breakage occurs. My best example to knowledge is this function right here: https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Arch_Linux_Archive#How_to_restore_all_packages_to_a_specific_date
 You don't need any extraneous software to roll back your system like timeshift. At least not with the packages. You can roll back your system in minutes to a stable date. I usually wait 2-4 weeks before rolling back to current and everything is peachy. 
 There's also the option of not updating very often. If one is concerned with security and exploits, the news and community updates are very on top of whether …]]></summary>

 What is the state of Linux in electric cars? With the help of Linux maybe we could prevent all that in the future. I really would like an open source firmware Linux powered electric car. Like maybe hacking the Tesla and installing coreboot? I don't want my government to lock me out of my car because I did something wrong. Or some hacker from Russia just hacks me and makes me crash into the woods. This is all possible.
 I think most electric cars will have that shitty old version of Linux kernel, maybe linux 2.6, that would have a lot of CVE bugs, that would be open to such hacking attacks. Even most routers in the world, even the most expensive routers run on some shitty old Linux kernel.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[为了匹配最新的树莓派 5 硬件，树莓派操作系统已做好准备，该系统中融入了 Debian 12 以及其他重大更新。


这个新版本的 树莓派操作系统Raspberry Pi OS 能够完善支持新推出的 树莓派 5。

为此，开发者们投入了大量的心血和精力。新系统带来了诸多改进，同时还标志着向更现代化的窗口系统的迁移。

下面，我们来看看他们的具体成果。

树莓派操作系统: 新的变化有哪些？



开发者基于最新的 Debian 12 “Bookworm” 版本，对树莓派桌面进行了 重大的架构更新。

一些显著的新特性包括：


全面采用 Wayland

网络性能显著提升

默认使用 PipeWire

为树莓派优化的 Firefox


显然，你将会享受到 Debian “Bookworm” 的核心优点，同时还能体验到上述提到的一些新变化。

全面采用 Wayland

没错，你没有看错。

树莓派桌面已经默认启用 Wayland 窗口系统，正式摒弃了因多种限制不再使用的 X11 窗口系统。Wayland 的主要优点是其在现代硬件上有更出色的性能表现。

这一切的实现离不开 Wayfire 合成器的支持，这使得开发者能够在更新中保持用户熟知的体验。

以下是开发者在发布公告中的引述：


如果你在树莓派 4 或 5 上启动树莓派操作系统，现在你会看到的是一个 Wayfire 桌面。它看起来和你之前在 Bullseye 上使用的桌面几乎一模一样，但在一致的外观背后，我们为了使两个桌面环境看起来一样已进行了大量的工作！


我们对此并不感到惊讶。

近期，我们注意到有很多桌面正在从 X11 和 Openbox 这样的旧窗口系统转向 Wayland。

比如，GNOME 最近的更新开启了向 全面使用 Wayland 的未来 的转变。即使是 Fedora Linux 40 也准备弃用 X11 会话，转向使用 Plasma 6 的 XWayland 方式。

看到树莓派操作系统已经率先进行了这样的变化，实在是让人感到十分有趣 😄


📋 不过别担心，对于仍希望使用 X11/Openbox 显示系统的用户，他们可以在 raspi-config 中的 “高级设置Advanced Settings” 菜单中重新启用它。


网络性能显著提升



开发者在之前实现的 NetworkManager 网络控制器的基础上进行了优化，他们为 任务栏增加了网络插件。

虽然新版本的插件和旧版本看上去差不多，但新增了一个 “高级选项Advanced Options” 选项，用户可以通过它访问 NetworkManager 提供的更多功能。

默认使用 PipeWire

现在，树莓派 Desktop 使用 PipeWire 来处理所有与音频/视频相关的任务。它取代了 PulseAudio，使音频/视频处理迈向更现代化和灵活的方式。

在用户端，你可以得到更优化的蓝牙音频设备管理、更低的延迟时间，和 Wayland 的更好互操作性等等。

用户也可以通过和切换窗口系统类似的步骤选择回退使用 PulseAudio。

为树莓派优化的 Firefox



这次，我们看到了一个由官方支持且专门为树莓派优化的 Mozilla Firefox 版本，它在这次树莓派操作系统的发布版中首次被引入。

现在，用户可以使用 V4L2 编码支持 来启用他们的树莓派上的硬件 h.264 解码器，这将会有助于实现更好的 HD 视频播放效果。

此外，他们也启用了 Widevine DRM，以在主流的视频流媒体平台上提供无障碍的流媒体观看体验。

在这次发布的版本中还有其他一些细微的变化。想了解更多，请参考 官方博客。

📥 下载树莓派操作系统

由于操作系统细节的大量变化，开发者建议你从全新安装开始 （重新烧录你的 SD 卡）。

当然，你也可以选择自行升级，但需要自担风险。

你可以访问 官方网站 进行下载。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Yay 是最流行的 AUR 助手之一，用于处理 Arch 用户资源库中的软件包。学习在 Arch Linux 中安装它。


你可以在 Arch 用户仓库Arch User Repository（AUR）中找到社区成员打包的大量软件。

由于它来自第三方，纯粹主义者建议从 AUR 手动下载并构建每个所需的包。

但这是一项乏味的任务，这就是为什么会有 AUR 助手来避免麻烦。

Yay 是最受欢迎的 AUR 帮助程序之一，在本教程中，我将分享如何在 Arch Linux 上安装 Yay。我还将分享一些有关使用 Yay 管理 AUR 包的技巧。


💡 Yay 可在 Manjaro 的仓库中找到。因此，Manjaro 用户只需使用 pacman -S yay 即可安装


在 Arch Linux 上安装 Yay

在继续安装 Yay 之前，你需要一些构建它所需的软件包。

让我把它分成几个步骤。

步骤 1：安装必备包

首先刷新包缓存并更新系统是一个好主意：

sudo pacman -Syu


安装所需的 base-devel（包含 makepkg 等工具）和 git（克隆 yay 的 Git 仓库所需的）。

sudo pacman -S --needed base-devel git


使用 --needed 标志，它不会重新安装已经安装的软件包。

它看起来是这样的：



现在你已经有了所需的软件包，是时候在你的系统上安装 Yay。

步骤 2：克隆 Yay Git 仓库并切换到它

使用 git 命令 “克隆” Yay 仓库。你可以在系统中的任何位置执行此操作，无论是主目录还是其他目录。

git clone https://aur.archlinux.org/yay.git


完成后，切换到克隆的目录：

cd yay




终于可以安装 Yay 了。

步骤 3：安装 Yay

事实上，你是在构建它。你将在此处看到 PKGBUILD 文件。使用以下命令从此处构建包：

makepkg -si


按照屏幕上的说明进行操作。当系统要求你确认时，按 Y。



该过程完成后，通过检查其版本来验证 Yay 是否已成功安装。

yay --version


现在你已经成功安装了它，你可以删除克隆的 Yay Git 仓库。不再需要它了。

使用 Yay 进行包管理

Yay 遵循与 pacman 类似（但不相同）的命令结构。所以你用 Yay 管理 AUR 包应该不难。

搜索软件包：

yay search_term


安装软件包：

yay -S package_name


删除软件包：

yay -R package_name


要删除包及其依赖项：

yay -Rns package_name


仅升级 AUR 包：

yay -Sua


Yay 还能够升级非 AUR 软件包。上面的 a 标志将其限制为 AUR。

将 Yay 升级到新版本

现在，你可能想知道如何将 Yay 升级到可用的新版本。

答案是你不需要做任何特别的事情。当你运行以下命令时，Yay 可以自行更新：

yay -Sua


从 Arch 系统中删除 Yay

如果你不喜欢 Yay 或不再需要它，你可以使用 pacman 命令像删除任何其他软件包一样删除它：

sudo pacman -Rs yay


总结

这是对 Yay AUR 助手的快速介绍。你可以访问其 GitHub 仓库以了解有关其工作的更多详细信息。

Arch 用户仓库（AUR）是为什么有些人喜欢使用 Arch Linux 的原因之一。

虽然纯粹的 Arch 用户一般都会嘲笑 AUR，特别是 AUR 助手，但它们仍然因其提供的易用性而受到欢迎。

我希望你发现这个快速教程有助于在 Arch Linux 上获得 Yay。如果你仍有疑问或发现任何技术错误，请告诉我。

谷歌正在考虑对其主页进行重大改动。上一次我们看到的实验是在页面上填充各种信息卡片，显示天气和股票等信息，但这次新的实验更加关注新闻。与只有谷歌的标志、搜索框和几个按钮的“传统”谷歌主页不同，最新的实验主页上看起来更像谷歌移动应用上的 “谷歌发现” 新闻推送，包括一排排谷歌通过算法检测到你会感兴趣的新闻文章。在新闻推送的右侧，是一堆卡片，内容包括体育比赛比分、股票和天气等。谷歌称这是目前正在印度进行的一项实验。

老王点评：下一步想必就是在这些文章块中插入各种旗帜广告和推广链接了。




密码学专家警告 NSA 在抗量子加密算法中埋入缺陷

美国伊利诺伊大学芝加哥分校的著名密码学家 丹尼尔·伯恩斯坦Daniel Bernstein 说，美国国家标准与技术研究院（NIST）正在故意掩盖美国国家安全局（NSA）参与开发 “后量子密码学”（PQC）新加密标准的程度。他还认为，NIST 在描述新标准安全性的计算中出现了错误——可能是偶然的，也可能是故意的。NIST 对此予以否认。伯恩斯坦称，NIST 对即将推出的 PQC 标准之一 Kyber512 的计算 “明显错误”，使其看起来比实际更安全。NIST 的 达斯汀·穆迪Dustin Moody 说：“我们不同意他的分析。这是一个没有科学确定性的问题，聪明人会有不同的看法。”


消息来源：《新科学家》



老王点评：这就是为什么我们要有自己的加密算法和标准的原因。




特斯拉发布 API 正式支持第三方应用程序

特斯拉正式发布了支持第三方应用程序的 API 文档，在此之前，特斯拉的非官方 API 一直处于灰色地带。目前，它主要面向车队管理，但开发者们希望这是创建健康应用生态系统的第一步。简而言之，它将正式支持第三方车队管理应用程序、智能手表集成应用程序等。特斯拉要求从明年开始，所有第三方应用程序都必须通过新的 API，将结束对 REST API 车辆指令端点的支持。


消息来源：Electrek



老王点评：电动汽车越来越智能化了，不过，这也带来了更多风险。支持 API 容易，如何平衡安全和生态才是难点。]]></summary>

        <link href="https://www.williamlong.info/archives/7318.html"/>
        <updated>2023-10-14T07:04:07.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[近日，网传自媒体大V即将实行“前台实名制”，引发关注。10月13日，一位微博大V发帖称，“全网自媒体要实施前台实名制了，就是大V的真实姓名要在一级页前端展示。”随后，该消息得到数位微博大V的确认。


据悉，此次前台实名制是上级部门为落实“自媒体管控13条”的具体行动之一。


2023年7月10日，中央网信办发布了《关于加强“自媒体”管理的通知》，新规从强化资质认证、加强谣言管理、规范账号运营等13个方面入手，试图加强对“自媒体”领域的管控。


以下为该自媒体大V收到的微博客服专员的消息全文：



为了进一步落实自媒体管理规定，100万粉丝以上的自媒体账号需要在10月底之前进行前台实名，全网所有平台统一执行。以微博为例，需要将您的真实姓名在您的微博资料页上公开展示。提前同步您知晓。


主要是以下几个方面:


1、以个人日常生活分享为主的领域账号，例如美食、美妆等领域不受此次实名要求影响，但时政、财经、娱乐等领域账号必须实名。


2、100万粉丝以下的账号在本阶段不受影响，但50-100万粉丝的账号在12月底前也需要完成前台实名。如您有需要，平台可支持检测垃圾粉丝并帮助您清理。


3、关于前台实名制，微博、抖音、腾讯等平台已经沟通争取过很多次，如果造成困扰，您可以将意见建议通过自己渠道反馈，也可以提交给我们代为转交。(以上为内部政策信息，请保密勿泄露）



我觉得，网络大V前台实名的目的就是为了让这些人闭嘴，网络大V的身份公布之后，网络大V肆意网爆他人就会存在巨大的风险，对企业造谣诽谤也会很容易收到律师函，网络大V的攻击功能将会大幅削弱。现在还能说话的网络大V，用处已经越来越少了，有句话说得好，兔死狗烹，鸟尽弓藏，应该卸磨杀驴了，这些人本来就是普通人，就不应该拥有那么多的权利，现在只是恢复正常而已。]]></summary>

💡 请注意，Xubuntu 23.10 将持续得到九个月的支持，一直到 2024 年 7 月。


🆕 Xubuntu 23.10：有什么新内容？



这个版本的 Xubuntu 基于 Ubuntu 23.10 “Mantic Minotaur” 版本，带来了许多崭新的改进。部分重要的亮点包括：


对 Xfce 的优化

应用程序的更新

Linux 内核 6.5


对 Xfce 的优化



Xubuntu 23.10 搭载了与之前相同的 Xfce 4.18 桌面环境。但在此基础上，它针对一些如 garcon、libxfce4ui、tumbler 和 xfconf 之类的 Xfce 库进行了多项问题修复。

此外，对于音频设备处理和媒体播放器，Xfce PulseAudio 插件 也进行了大量的修复。

在上一版本中，用户曾遇到的关于 Xfce 电源管理器 和 Xfce 屏幕保护程序 的一些问题，也在这个版本中得到了修复。

最后， Xfce 截屏 新增了对 AVIF 和 JPEG XL 文件格式的支持。


Xfce 4.18 版本发布：令人印象深刻


应用程序的更新

在 Xubuntu 23.10 版本中，有了一整套更新的应用程序，其中大部分来源于 XFCE、GNOME 和 MATE 的核心应用的更新。

其中一些显著的更新包括：


Catfish 4.16.4

Mousepad 0.6.1

Thunar 文件管理器 4.18.7

MATE 日历 1.26.0

GNOME 软件 45

Rhythmbox 3.4.7

GIMP 2.10.34


Linux 内核 6.5



Xubuntu 23.10 由最新发布的 Linux 内核 6.5 进行驱动，这样便可以支持最新的硬件，比如 USB4、Wi-Fi 7 ，并且提供了 良好的 Rust 环境支持、AMD FreeSync 视频 等。

🛠️ 其他的改进

除了以上提到的内容，还有一些值得一提的变化:


引入了 Greybird 3.23.3，以便得到更好的 GTK 3/4 支持。

在 PipeWire 环境下加强了对蓝牙耳机的支持。

Firefox、Thunderbird 以及其他新的应用程序中现在使用的是彩色表情符。

刷新了 elementary-xfce 0.18 主题，带给你全新的桌面图标体验。

引入了 Ristretto 0.13.1，给 Xubuntu 的默认图像查看器添加了打印支持功能。


你可以查阅 官方发布说明 来更深入地了解 Xubuntu 23.10 发行版特性。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[在欧洲有汉籍收藏的城市中，意大利首都罗马无疑是最负盛名者之一。得益于自大航海时代以来与中国的密切接触，罗马收藏汉籍的总量较多，质量也较佳，且多为著名汉学家旧藏。治中国传统文献之学者，如有机会到访罗马，除到古迹景点观光之外，前往相关汉籍收藏机构探访一番，不失为别有风味之经历。然罗马收藏汉籍的图书馆众多，开放时间与入馆要求各不相同。贸然前往，或有吃闭门羹之虞。笔者2014年曾因《梵蒂冈图书馆藏明清中西文化交流史文献丛刊》编纂工作需要，在罗马居住数月。今年7月，又趁暑假之机到罗马访书一月，造访了四家图书馆。

罗马

一、梵蒂冈图书馆（Biblioteca Apostolica Vaticana）
梵蒂冈本身即是位于罗马的国中之国，凡到该馆访书者，必须先到罗马。该馆拥有早在十六世纪即进入欧洲的一批汉籍，法国著名汉学家傅圣泽（Jean-François Foucquet，1665-1741）旧藏的一半以上也存于此地，在欧洲汉籍收藏机构中影响巨大。
凡游罗马者，圣彼得广场为必到之景点。由广场北行，过一拱门，不远处有一铁栅门，门前设交通灯，名为“圣安娜门”（Porta Sant'Anna），此门内即为通往梵蒂冈图书馆之道路。门内尚有三道关卡，临近门口者，为著名的“瑞士卫队”把守，衣着华丽，亦为一景。初次到馆者，需携带专家推荐信（外文）及护照，在第二个关卡处登记，换取临时通行证。进入图书馆后办理阅览证，下次来馆，凭阅览证即可通行无阻。即便再次到访的时间在数年之后，仍可凭证直接进入图书馆，到办证处重新激活即可。

梵蒂冈图书馆

由圣安娜门入内直行至尽头，为一个大庭院，意大利语名“Cortile del Belvedere”，意为风景优美的院子，或译为“丽城庭院”。进入庭院后，右侧有二门，一为图书馆，一为档案馆。进入图书馆后左转，为办证处，可用英文与工作人员交流。在办证处仍需提交推荐信等材…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Kubuntu 预装了必要的 KDE Plasma 及应用更新。


如果你期待在 Ubuntu 基础之上更新你的 KDE 体验，那么欢迎尝试 Kubuntu 23.10。

KDE Plasma 5.27.8

可能你会好奇，为何在这次新的更新中还停留在 KDE Plasma 5.27阶段？

这是因为它是 KDE Plasma 6 升级（计划在 2024 年 2 月 进行）前的最后一个版本。所以，你不会看到 KDE Plasma 5.28 的发布。



在 KDE Plasma 5.27.8，做了许多显著的问题修复以及改进，包括对混合睡眠的支持、利用 Plasma 系统监视器System Monitor 对多 GPU 配置中的英伟达 GPU 的监控。

也优化了 KRunner 在 X11 上的性能，系统设置中的关键词搜索更加高效。



对于 Kubuntu 的软件中心 “发现Discover” 应用，改进了一些 Flatpak 错误的处理方式，你将享受更佳的用户体验。

Linux 内核 6.5

Linux 内核 6.5 带来了硬件兼容性的改进，以及对英特尔 Arc 图形的全方位支持，你现在可以在最新的系统上尝试 Kubuntu。

Linux 内核 6.5 引入了一些包括 Wi-Fi 7 和 USB 4 在内的尖端技术支持。关于更多变化，你可以在我们的报道中详细了解：


Linux 内核 6.5 发布，首次支持 Wi-Fi 7 和 USB4


应用程序更新



Kubuntu 为你预装了最新版 Firefox 118，你可以试用其内建的翻译功能（LCTT 译注：不支持中文）。

升级版的 LibreOffice 7.6 也在本次更新中登场，与之前的版本相比，其表现出显著的进步，提供了新的主题、更好的用户体验以及更优的兼容性。

此外，我们还预装了漂亮的 Thunderbird 115。

除此之外，你还会获取常规的 KDE 应用更新、问题修复，以及 KDE 框架的改进。

其他改进

随着所有的 KDE 更新、软件包升级和桌面改进，相信你会在用户体验上感受到很多细微的变化。

一些其他的技术更新包括：


Qt 5.15.10

Kate 23.08.1

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[[A bit ranty]
 It was good back in the day when there weren't many viable alternatives to Windows software and it served its purpose well. However, right now I feel like there's too much energy wasted on it when there are many good native Linux software that should be prioritized. We have many applications trying to replicate a Windows experience while we have good projects like GIMP and Kdenlive that are dying because there's almost nobody contributing to them. There's some kind of obsession with having a Windows like experience on Linux when I don't think it's necessary given how far Linux has got today. Even big Corp now like Epic games, Autodesk and Unity do develop for Linux. Steam has literally made a gaming device dedicated for Linux users. I think these compatibility layers should be a thing of the past by now, otherwise Linux will remain only a DE where people feel somehow superior for not using Windows, only to install 30 Wine versions to get a Windows application to run.

 Don't get me wrong, I genuinely appreciate the world of open source and Linux. However, I'm one of those individuals who can't simply "live with bugs." So, I go the extra mile by diligently documenting and reporting them in bug trackers. It's time-consuming and, at times, quite frustrating, but it's a necessary endeavor.

When I was in Bilbao recently for the Open Source Summit Europe event, the main topic of conversation was the European Union's (EU) Cyber Resilience Act (CRA). Everyone – and I mean everyone – mentioned it. Why? Because pretty much everyone with an open source clue sees it as strangling open source software development.

If we don’t act now, #opensource programmers around the world, not just in Europe, will face a mountain of paperwork and legal woes.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[微软公司10月13日宣布，在获得英国反垄断监管机构“竞争与市场管理局”（CMA）的批准之后，现已完成687亿美元收购动视暴雪交易。这意味着，经过20多个月的努力，微软终于成功收购动视暴雪。


动视暴雪是《使命召唤》、《魔兽世界》和《暗黑破坏神》等游戏的发行商。去年1月，微软宣布以687亿美元收购动视暴雪。交易完成后，微软将成为世界上营收第三高的游戏公司，仅次于腾讯和索尼。


随后，全球多家监管机构对这笔交易展开了调查。今日，微软终于从英国CMA手中赢得了这笔交易所需的最后一张通行证。微软Xbox业务主管Phil Spencer对此表示：“我们都热爱游戏。不仅玩游戏，也开发游戏，能够切身体会到游戏对个人、集体和社区意味着什么。今天，我们正式欢迎动视暴雪和他们的团队来到Xbox。”


这笔交易是微软有史以来进行的最大的一笔收购交易，远超2016年的以260亿美元收购领英（LinkedIn），以及2021年以75亿美元收购游戏发行商Bethesda。同时，这也是微软有史以在游戏市场采取的最大规模行动。交易完成后，微软将成为全球第三大游戏公司。


Phil Spencer还表示，微软现计划将动视暴雪的许多游戏添加到Xbox Game Pass订阅服务中。他说：“今天，我们开始将备受欢迎的动视、暴雪和King系列游戏引入Game Pass和其他平台。在接下来的几个月里，我们会公布更多相关信息。我们知道大家很兴奋，我们也是。”


本周早些时候，动视暴雪已明确表示，《现代战争3》（Modern Warfare 3）和《暗黑破坏神4》（Diablo IV）今年将不会登陆Xbox Game Pass。早在2022年1月，微软曾透露Xbox Game Pass的订阅人数已达到2500万。但此后，微软一直没有更新其新订阅量。


收购动视暴雪后，微软的Xbox游戏工作室将增加超过9家来自暴雪方面的游戏工作室，以及来自King方面的超过11个游戏工作室。同时，微软也将转型为一家出版巨头，将有超过8500名动视暴雪员工加入微软。


动视暴雪CEO Bobby Kotic表示：“我之前也说过，我将全力帮助微软完成过渡。Spencer希望我继续担任动视暴雪CEO，直接向他汇报工作。我们已经达成协议，我将一直工作到2023年底。为了我们的团队和玩家，我们将共同努力，以确保平稳过渡。”

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[tl;dr: I made a CLI tool for managing markdown notes as a zettelkasten. github is here. License is GPLv3.
 I've recently moved towards using a pure terminal-based workflow for most of my stuff (zsh and helix), and got tired of Obsidian's bad support for synching unless you pay for their subscription service. Switched to just using git for synching between devices.
 I was missing some of the features of Obsidian plugins like task management and being able to tag, filter and sort my notes, so I made my own tool. Version 0.1.1 supports:
  
Customisation using a toml dotfile
 Loading yaml metadata from document headers
 Understanding tasks with extended syntax like Obsidian's tasks plugin
 Querying fields using a sql-like query language
 Setting macros / shortcuts for different formats, queries, and commands
 Grep and cat commands integrated to the app
  
Let me know if you have any thoughts and I'll throw them in the backlog for future releases!
 Would also love any pull requests for custom themes / ricing of the app.

在 Ubuntu 23.10 发布数小时后，Canonical 撤下了 ISO，原因是 Ubuntu 桌面的安装程序用户界面的一组特定翻译中发现了恶意贡献者的仇恨言论。Canonical 称，“这些翻译并非 Ubuntu 存档的一部分，我们认为该事件仅涉及部分应用程序所采用的第三方翻译工具提供的翻译。”因此，Canonical 正在努力纠正翻译，重新生成 ISO。涉及的镜像包括 Ubuntu 桌面 23.10 及其每日构建版和 Ubuntu Budgie 23.10。在重新生成之前，目前只能下载 Ubuntu 23.10 的服务器版和 netboot 压缩包。

欧洲考虑开源 TETRA 紧急服务加密算法

TETRA 是一种地面集群无线电协议，在欧洲、英国等国家用于保障政府机构、执法部门、军队和应急服务组织使用的无线电通信。今年 7 月，荷兰一家安全公司发现了 TETRA 中的 五个漏洞，其中两个被认为是关键漏洞。负责 TETRA 算法的 ETSI 技术委员会称已于去年 10 月修复，并指出 “没有发现任何主动利用运行网络的行为”。但由于该加密算法的专有性质，这使得对应急网络系统进行适当的五重测试变得更加困难，ETSI 也因此遭受到批评。ETSI 正在讨论是否公开这些算法。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[打开拼多多，看到《民法典》商品页面下“已拼100万+”的字眼，意料之外，却又情理之中。不禁想一探究竟：买《民法典》的是谁？正在经历什么？他们为什么要买《民法典》？
以上问题仍是一种文学化的想象，并带有一种英雄主义式的期待：期待一个人遇到一本书，然后全然改变了自己，获得另一种思想，走向另一种人生。
但事实上，购买《民法典》的绝大多数缘由十分朴素，它们直指生活：那里有家长里短，那里有山长水阔；那里满是闪闪发光的瞬间，那里一地鸡毛。不仅仅是《民法典》，买下《人性的弱点》的100万+人、买下《孙子兵法》的80万+人、买下《山海经》的50万+人、买下《本草纲目》的30万+人、买下《我与地坛》的20万+人、买下英语语法书的10万+人等等，都是如此。
他们留下的书评，或许无法满足想象中的所谓“思想的深度”，但是可以照见生活的广度。一个一个的人，在一本一本的书面前，袒露自己的忧虑、当下、梦想和人生。
忧虑
《民法典》10万+书评里的生活，就像一张气泡纸，被忧虑填满。
这些忧虑，或者来自于未雨绸缪。有人住在上世纪八九十年代的老旧住宅楼里，很焦虑“房子到了70年还归我吗”；有人刚刚回到老家创业，想让自己走得稳稳当当；有人听说“老公工资不上交违法”，大吃一惊却又心怀窃喜地买书确认……大多数人暂时没有具体的忧虑，只是觉得“懂点法律有益无害，说不准就用上了”。
有些忧虑，或者来自于已有的不如意。有人正在准备公务员考试，发现自己法律方面的知识点基础不牢，趁着春节期间恶补；有一户人家附近，经常被人乱倒污水，深受其扰，大概多次交涉无果，无奈买下《民法典》，想着或许可以依照法律条文来解决问题；还有人的家人正在和别人打官司，他带着一种临时抱佛脚的急切买下《民法典》。
当然，忧虑不是只存在于法律的条框里，它也在生活的琐碎里。《百病食疗大全》的8.2万评论里，有人的母亲三叉神经痛，有人的小孩吃饭胃口不好，有人的爷…]]></summary>

首先，确定一个安装方式。你可以选择使用 Windows 的 Linux 子系统（Windows Subsystem for Linux）（WSL）进行安装，也可以选择完全安装在物理硬件上（即裸机安装），或者在本地或云端创建一个虚拟机（VM）来运行 Linux。

其次，选择一个 Linux 发行版。如：Ubuntu、Debian、Kali Linux、OpenSUSE 等。

然后，按照你所选的安装方法进行操作。具体可以是以下四种方式之一：

使用 Windows 子系统 Linux（WSL）中的安装 Linux 命令

在云中创建一个 Linux 虚拟机（VM）

在本机创建一个 Linux 虚拟机（VM）

创建一个可引导的 USB，以安装裸机版 Linux



Linux 安装完成后，你需要熟悉你所选发行版的包管理器，更新和升级可获取的包，并熟悉微软提供的 Linux 资源，比如培训课程、为 Linux 设计的流行工具、新闻以及开源活动等。


步骤 1：选择一个安装 Linux 的方法

至于如何选择安装 Linux 的方式，这主要取决于你的需求和喜好。


如果你是 Linux 新手，我们推荐你首先尝试 Windows 的 Linux 子系统（WSL），这是入门 Linux 最简单的方法。

如果你正在企业环境中工作，或你在处理的业务有更复杂的需求，如规模或安全性等方面，我们推荐你在云端运行 Linux 虚拟机，并查看 Azur…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[《法庭上的莎士比亚》，[英]昆廷·斯金纳著，罗宇维译，译林出版社2023年8月出版，500页，98.00元

近期译林出版社翻译出版了《法庭上的莎士比亚》，此书是英国思想史家昆廷·斯金纳对于修辞技艺（ars rhetorica）研究的第三部作品，加上前两部《近代政治思想的基础》（1978）和《霍布斯哲学思想中的理性和修辞》（1996），以及之后问世的《从人文主义到霍布斯》（2018），这一系列构成了斯金纳对于修辞技艺在文艺复兴思想史中的地位进行持续研究的四部曲成果。而此四部曲的出版顺序也反映了作者“ABAB”的研究时序特征，即从古典修辞与人文主义的关系，到霍布斯与人文主义修辞；再由莎剧的古典修辞出发，最终回归到霍布斯修辞技艺的研究过程。尤其在第四部出版前，斯金纳本人最为得意的作品正是第三部《法庭上的莎士比亚》，因为这是其从文本的“语境·概念·修辞”（见李宏图：《语境·概念·修辞——昆廷·斯金纳与思想史研究》，《世界历史》，2005年第4期）的方法论向非文本的“规定情境·动作·表演”论的转向尝试。
研究莎剧，似乎是英国文艺复兴绕不开的话题，斯金纳对这位英国老乡更是不会陌生。早在其《近代政治思想的基础》中，斯金纳就举例哈姆莱特的台词来为马基雅维利的政治观念备书；2009年在其弟子阿米蒂奇等人主编的《莎士比亚和近代早期政治思想》一书的编后记中，斯金纳更是明确表示莎剧与修辞技艺间的密切关联。而当斯金纳开始专门以莎剧作为研究对象时，其擅长的“语境·概念·修辞”的方法论已开始出现更为“精分”的转向，因为其触及有关修辞技艺的本质性探讨。当从法庭这一戏剧化场景切入研究时，斯金纳已经由原初的文本语境转入了俄罗斯戏剧家斯坦尼斯拉夫斯基的戏剧“规定情境”。而法庭情境中的动作·表演，就可对位到文本语境中的概念·修辞。
斯金纳认为莎士比亚的法庭修辞技艺继承于古代罗马修辞术，其实早在希腊悲剧时期，法庭…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ubuntu 23.10 “Mantic Minotaur” 再度亮相，搭载了 GNOME 45，以及众多引人瞩目的升级。


又一次，一如既往的一年一度，我们迎来全新的 Ubuntu 发布！

这次发布的版本是 Ubuntu 23.10 ，这不是一个 长期支持（LTS）版本，它的代号是 “Mantic Minotaur” （预言牛头人）。

非 LTS 版本更偏向于满足那些想要获取到 Ubuntu 最新以及最出众特性的用户。

对于那些希望长时间坚守一个版本的用户，我们建议使用 LTS 版本，比如 Ubuntu 20.04 和 Ubuntu 22.04。

总之，让我们深入了解这次发布的新版本，去发现其中的亮点。


💡 Ubuntu 23.10 将会 提供九个月的支持，一直到 2024 年 7 月为止。


⭐ Ubuntu 23.10：新版调整了什么？



即使这是一个非 LTS 发布，但是 Ubuntu 23.10 却包含了许多有趣的新特性和升级。

一些主要亮点包括：


更新升级的安装程序

受限的非特权用户命名空间

GNOME 45

全新的壁纸

基于 Flutter 的应用商店

Linux 内核 6.5 


更新升级的安装程序



首先，Ubuntu 23.10 的安装程序 开始实验性地支持两大重要功能 ：

其一是 TPM 支持的全盘加密（FDE），这意味着采用全新的加密机制。它将与你主板上的 TPM 芯片协同运作。

其二是期待已久的 ZFS 支持 再次回归到安装程序中，它在 Ubuntu 23.04 被移除。


📋 更广泛的 TPM 支持的全盘加密硬件支持将在 Ubuntu 24.04 LTS 中推出。


受限的非特权用户命名空间

that it will be maintaining the 6.1 kernel for a minimum of ten years past
its initial release (and, thus, through 2032).


	CIP kernels are maintained like regular long-term-stable (LTS)
	kernels, and developers of the CIP kernel are also involved in LTS
	kernel review and testing. While regular LTS kernels are moving
	back to 2 years maintenance, CIP kernels are set up for 10
	years. In order to enable this extended lifetime, CIP kernels are
	scoped-down in actively supported kernel features and target
	architecture. At the same time, CIP kernels accept non-invasive
	backports from newer mainline kernels that enable new hardware.]]></summary>

attached, perform a number of privileged operations; the ability to load
and run those programs, thus, must be a privileged operation in its own
right.  Almost since the beginning of the extended-BPF era, developers have
struggled to find a way to allow users to run the programs they need
without giving away more privilege than is necessary.  Earlier this year,
the idea of a BPF token ran into some
opposition from security-oriented developers.  Andrii Nakryiko has since
returned with an
updated patch set that significantly increases the granularity of the
privileges that can be conferred with a BPF token.]]></summary>

微软发布了一份题为《如何下载和安装 Linux》的实用指南，给出了四种可供选择的安装方法：使用 WSL 2、使用本地虚拟机、使用云虚拟机或在裸机上安装。著名科技网站 The Register 认为，这篇教程“确实不差”。当然，我们知道，这实际上还是在推广它的 WSL 2。


消息来源：微软



老王点评：我觉得，就差一个 Microsoft Linux 了。




一位 23 岁的贡献者修复了一个 22 年之久的 Firefox 问题

Firefox 最近修复了一个有 22 年历史的工具栏鼠标提示错误：当鼠标悬浮在工具栏图标上时会展示相关提示，如果此时将浏览器从前台切换到后台，该鼠标提示会仍然留在前台。一位 Firefox 用户注意到了这个讨厌的问题，并发现该问题已经存在了 22 年之久。但由于这个问题很细微，优先度极低，因此一直没有得到修复。于是他决定自己来修复，他知道如何编程，但此前从未向开源项目贡献过代码。通过搜索问题所在和编写代码，他提交了补丁，并在 Mozilla 的工程师帮助下完善了补丁。


消息来源：Ars Technica



老王点评：真的，只要你想，你都可以成为一个开源贡献者，甚至是在 Firefox 这么复杂、重要的项目中。




红帽关闭其安全公告邮件列表

红帽公司上周悄悄宣布关闭 rhsa-announce 邮件列表，不再向该列表发送安全公告通知。这个邮件列表接收 RHEL 和一系列相关产品的安全公告。主要的变化是收件箱中的直接通知将消失，现在这些通知邮件都是付费的，只有付费的红帽客户才能收到提醒。也许庆幸的是，它仍将通过 RSS 订阅源共享信息，这个所有人都可以免费访问，虽然不知道能维持多久。有很多人依赖于邮件列表来保持他们的服务器组件的更新，而不是通过官方推送的软件更新，比如运行自定义和嵌入式发行版的用户。此外，系统管理员们也需要在官方推送补丁之前，提前通过邮件列表等方式获得相关安全信息。


消息来源：The Register



老王点评：希望不是我的错觉，而是电子邮件列表这种形式太古老了。]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[近读吕正惠先生的《第二个经典时代：重估唐宋文学》，其中有一篇谈及苏东坡词《念奴娇·赤壁怀古》（“东坡《念奴娇》的再诠释——兼论东坡在黄州的心境”），议论颇有见地，读后极受启发。吕先生在文中谈到了对“多情应笑我，早生华发”一句的理解，列举了俞平伯、胡云翼等的解释：多情应笑我，是倒装句，应笑我多情。记得我读中学时，语文老师也是这样解释的。但吕先生的解释是，多情，指多情人，指已去世、葬在家乡的太太，认为这样解释在训诂上完全没有问题（79页）。吕先生为了找到“同志”，甚至“神魂颠倒”了好几天。终于在他大学时代的老师郑骞先生编的教材《词选》里找到了：“多情，东坡自谓其亡妻也。东坡元配王氏，早卒，坡常追念之，集中《江城子·十年生死两茫茫》词即悼亡作。王氏归葬眉山，故云故国神游。笑我生华发句，对小乔夫婿之雄姿英发而言。”据此，“故国神游”的意思是“我梦中回到了故乡眉山”，在故乡的妻子王弗笑我“早生华发”。接着，吕先生谈到了学界对“故国神游”和“多情应笑我，早生华发”两句词如何理解的两次大规模争论，迄今尚无定论。

《题竹图》，纸本墨笔，纵191厘米，横104.5厘米，明代杜堇绘，北京，故宫博物院藏。描绘北宋大学士苏东坡题诗于竹上的场景。

吕先生与他的老师郑骞先生对“多情”的理解是完全正确的，具体分析详见吕先生文章，此处不赘。我想重点谈一谈这句话的英译，我手头有四个译文，分别出自徐忠杰、许渊冲、任治稷和卓振英诸位先生之手。
徐忠杰《词百首英译》： It is befitting that friends should laugh at me./ For his sensibilities, a man must pay:/ His hair prematurely becomes whitish gray.
许渊冲《唐宋词一百首》：Sentimental, his wife would laugh to say,/ Younger than they, I have my hair all turned gray.
任治稷《东坡之诗》：You may take me for a sentimental fool,/Whose hair has been early laced with white.
卓振英《咏情言志》：One might jest that, so carried away/ By th’reflections, I’d have my hair grayed soon.
徐忠杰先生把“笑我”的人理解为“朋友们”（friends）； “多情”翻译成“his sensibilities”，显然不确。任治稷先生把“笑我”的人做泛化处理，译为“You”；“多情”理解为“我这个多情的傻子”（a sentimental fool），也不确。
卓振英先生同样没有理解“笑我”的人是谁，也是做了泛化处理；对“多情”的翻译显得过于复杂。
许渊冲先生对“笑我”的人理解完全正确：his wife，他将sentimental置于句首，按照一般语法规则，这个sentimental修饰的是后面的主语his wife，所以许译的意思“多情的”妻子笑我“早生华发”，这样理解自然没错！但是许译“早生华发”却令人费解了，主要是人称代词混乱，让读者不知所云。
根据上述对原词的理解，“多情应笑我，早生华发”一句不妨译为：My wife should laugh at me: Younger than Zhou Gongjin, your hair has turned gray earlier.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[《摩登图释》，陈建华著，浙江大学出版社，2023年8月出版，358页，78.00元

近日读陈建华教授研究上海魔都文化的新著《摩登图释》，一时联想到瓦尔特·本雅明（Walter Benjamin）的“拱廊研究计划”（Das Passagen-Werk；The Arcades Project），深感两者之间有某种心灵上的契合气息。本雅明在开篇即提到“时新服饰用品商店”，然后说巴尔扎克描写的就是这个时代：“从马德莱娜教堂到圣丹尼门，一首宏大的展示之诗吟诵着五光十色的诗节。”（本雅明《巴黎，19世纪的首都》，刘北成译，上海人民出版社，2006年，第3页）现在重读巴尔扎克这句话，恍然感到它不仅描写了十九世纪的巴黎，而且是以“五光十色的诗节”击中了本雅明和陈建华的诗性心灵。1927年旅居巴黎的本雅明被超现实主义作家阿拉贡（Louis Aragon）的一部以歌剧院拱廊被拆毁为题材的小说触动，他说现代人的欢乐在于“最后一瞥之恋”（love at last sight），由此开始了他有关巴黎拱廊的研究，也就是本雅明式的感知文化史研究。陈建华在《摩登图释》“自序”中讲述在哈佛岁月中如何从研究周瘦鹃到研究摩登上海，想到文化是一个整体，于是在图书资料中重新拥抱这个自己最熟悉的城市的前世，感觉到美丽与乡愁，期待在研究过程中发生蝴蝶效应。或许也可以说，陈建华的“最后一瞥之恋”产生于他只能在文学与图像中追忆的摩登都市诱惑之中。如果说令本雅明感伤的是现代性从“一见钟情”到“最后一瞥”的短促时光，那么对于陈建华来说，或许更是历史的无情夭折——在泛黄的画报中有一幅陆小曼女士的玉照曾令他“乍见之下心头一颤”，觉着“有一种说不出的悲剧意味”。卢卡奇说本雅明带有一种浪漫主义的反资本主义态度，陈建华的浪漫与温情则是感叹历史的无情——当他在图书馆翻阅着泛黄的杂志、照片，或许会感到时光就凝固在这里，凝固在上世纪二三十年…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[我很高兴分享我最喜欢的 26 个 FreeDOS 命令。


我家最早的一批计算机中有一台运行着一款名称为 DOS 的命令行操作系统，即 “磁盘操作系统Disk Operating System”。我是在 DOS 系统环境中长大的，学会了利用命令行来使我的工作更轻松。很多其他的人也是如此。我们非常爱 DOS ，所以在 1994 年 6 月 29 日，我们创建了 FreeDOS 工程。

如果你的 FreeDOS 的初学者，你可能会对如何使用其附带的不同的命令行程序感到困惑。让我们从我最喜欢的 26 个 FreeDOS 命令开始吧。要学习更多的信息，在大部分命令的后面添加 /? 选项来获取更多的信息:

C:\>attrib /?
ATTRIB v2.1 - 显示或更高文件属性。
版权所有 (c) 1998-2003，遵循 GPL2 协议。

语法：ATTRIB { options | [path][file] | /@[list] }

选项：

  +H 设置隐藏属性。     -H  清除隐藏属性。
  +S 设置系统属性。     -S  清除系统属性。
  +R 设置只读属性。     -R  清除只读属性。
  +A 设置存档属性。     -A  清楚存档属性。

  /S 处理具体指定路径中的所有目录中的文件。
  /D 处理带有通配符的参数的目录名称。
  /@ 处理文件，文件列在具体指定文件 中 [或 stdin]。

示例：

  attrib file -rhs
  attrib +a -r dir1 dir2*.dat /s
  attrib -hs/sd /@list.txt *.*


A 是 ATTRIB

ATTRIB 程序显示或更改文件的 属性 。属性可以是以下四个值之一：隐藏（H）、…]]></summary>

Basically, I got sick of manually looking up each book on my Want to Read list on the Libby app to see if it was available or how long the wait was. So I made this site which easily gathers all that info for me.
At this point, I'm scraping Goodreads to figure out the "Want to Read" list. Libby provides a nice API though.
Any feedback is appreciated!! I also have a substack that I'm going to use to post updates, so follow along there if you're interested :) projecttbr.substack.com

GNOME vulnerability has a number of interesting facets.  The problem lies
in a library that reads files in a fairly obscure format, but it turns out
that files in that format are routinely—automatically—processed by GNOME if
they are downloaded to the local system.  That turns a vulnerability in a
largely unknown library into a one-click remote-code-execution flaw for
the GNOME desktop.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As many of you probably are, so too am i excited about the prospect of having a normal linux distro in my pocket. Things like Mobian and plasma mobile and postmarketOS, those projects excite me to no end. 
 But there is a question and a problem gnawing at me, all of them focus on hardware that is extremely old or extremely underpowered. (Pinephone eg.) 
 The F(x)tec phone seemed great, but its been years now and no mainline support has been achieved, aparently due to drivers. 
 Then on the other side of the FOSS mobile land, there exist projects like CalyxOS and GrapheneOS.
 Both of these specialize in supporting Pixel phones, because they are supported in AOSP, from this i would assume so are all the required drivers for the display, modems etc. (Maybe this is where im wrong?) Android really only being a pimped out linux kernel, id assume it would we way less work to integrate those already existing and opensourced drivers into mainline, and have ourselfs a perfomant pocket PC ? 
 What am i missing / Where am i wrong?
 Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Linux Mint 21.2 Edge ISO 来了！


Linux Mint 背后的人们一直在努力推出主要版本，例如 Linux Mint 21.2 和 LMDE 6。

一系列的发布似乎并没有停止，因为我们现在以 “Linux Mint 21.2 Edge” 的形式得到了另一个版本。

请允许我告诉你更多相关信息。

Linux Mint 21.2 Edge：可以期待什么？



Linux Mint 21.2 Edge 采用 Linux 内核 6.2，为那些希望运行较新硬件而不喜欢 Linux 内核 5.15 LTS（常规 Linux Mint 21.2 版本的特性）的用户量身定制。

现在对于 Intel Arc 显卡用户来说绝对是一个不错的 Linux 发行版选择！

如果你对 “Edge” ISO 感到好奇，请参阅 文档：


除了常规 ISO 镜像之外，Linux Mint 有时还会为其最新版本提供 “Edge” ISO 镜像。该镜像附带更新的组件，能够支持最现代的硬件芯片组和设备。


此外，此 ISO 还恢复了对安全启动的支持。对于那些想要它的人来说，这应该是一个有用的附加组件。

不要忘记，Linux Mint 21.2 Edge 仅提供 “Cinnamon” 风格桌面，没有任何 XFCE 或 MATE 风格。

不过，除了更新的硬件支持之外，与常规版本相比，使用 Edge 版本时你不会发现任何差异。

想要试一试？

前往 官方网站 从众多可用的下载镜像之一获取 ISO。


Linux Mint 21.2 Edge


请注意，此版本仅提供 64 位版本，没有 32 位选项。

💬 你会尝试 Edge ISO 吗？ 请在下面告诉我们！

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi
 I have been reading a lot of comments regarding this topic but I do not fully understand it I think.
 So I have a couple of questions for the techies out there.
 So there is alot that x11 can do but some things just don't work and the same with Wayland.
 Why is that... why cant multiple refresh rate not work with x11? 
 Why cant Wayland function without vsync and therefore latency ?
 so I am asking this because, as far as I understand it, it is a limitation by the very design of these two systems, and not a limitation of developer time on these systems ?
 If it is a limitation of design... then it is very bad and there should be a new design.
 It is one of the most important things in a system, is it not ?
 So what does windows OS or macOS use, to make them work without latency and with all the bells and whistles ?
 Inst it just possible to copy some of.. lets say macOS features to make it work ?
 that is all 
 thanks :)

 For everyone else, as you may or may not know, pwfeedback is an option you can set in /etc/sudoers to enable showing of asterisks/stars as password feedback when entering your sudo password in terminal. This gives you some feedback about the fact that the system is registering your key presses, rather than just showing the blank entry box as is by default.

微软表示，VBScript 已被弃用，被列在其 Windows 客户端废弃功能列表中。在未来的 Windows 版本中，VBScript 将作为一项可选功能，之后会从 Windows 中删除。VBScript 首次发布于 1996 年，但其早在 2010 年就停止了开发。它是一种脚本语言，曾一度被 Windows 系统管理员广泛用于自动执行任务，直到被 2006 年问世的 PowerShell 所取代。VBScript 也曾用于 IE 和 IIS 中，但由于其它浏览器并不支持它，因此在微软独有的环境之外逐渐被 JavaScript 所取代。

严重安全漏洞影响三年来的所有 curl 版本

前几天，curl 官方就发出预警，其正在修复一个高危安全漏洞，并将在今天发布修复版本 8.4.0。根据刚刚发布的最新版本和安全公告，这个漏洞影响从 2020 年 3 月发布的 7.69.0 到 8.3.0 的所有版本。该漏洞导致 curl 在 SOCKS5 代理握手过程中堆缓冲区溢出。鉴于 curl 和 libcurl 被广泛用在各种项目中，其带来的影响非常广泛。建议的做法是升级到最新版本，或者不要使用 SOCKS5 代理。curl 作者还就如何产生该漏洞做了深入探讨和 反省。

老王点评：虽然这种事情在所难免，但是又一次让人思考现有的开源软件供应链模式是否先天上难以免除这种风险？或许需要一些不一样的思考。




谷歌等披露 HTTP/2 “快速重置” DDoS 攻击

最近几个月，Cloudflare、AWS、谷歌以及其他大型云服务商都受到了一种新型 DDoS 攻击，其中一些 DDoS 攻击达到了每秒 2 亿至 4 亿次请求。谷歌云报告称，由于这种现在被称为 HTTP/2 “快速重置”攻击的攻击，其每秒请求数达到了破纪录的 3.98 亿。这种攻击的模式是，攻击端发起请求使服务器端开始工作，然后快速重置请求。当请求被取消，但 HTTP/2 连接仍保持开放，而服务器仍需为取消的请求做大量工作。并且，立即重置流的能力使每个连接都能无限量地发送请求。通过明确取消请求，攻击者永远不会超过并发开放流的数量限制。

 Protocol vs implementation
 Both X11 and Wayland are protocols, the messages that these protocols define can be found as xml here for X11, and here for wayland, but they aren't really that interesting to look at. 
 When a developer wants to write an application (client), they use that protocol (and documentation) to create messages that they send over (typically, but not always) a unix-socket, on which the server listens. The protocol is bo…]]></summary>

中生勝美著，《近代日本の人類学史：帝国と植民地の記憶》，风响社，2017年版

相比于政治学、经济学、社会学、法学等社会科学基础学科，人类学在近代中国的成立更晚。这些学科的开创大多得益于更早学科化的日本学界——连名称都是清一色的“和制汉语”，而人类学的起步之晚，要因不在学术。正如人类学家凯瑟琳·高夫（Kathleen Gough）所言：“人类学是西方帝国主义的孩子。（Anthropology is a child of Western imperialism.）”日本人类学会在1884年成立，这一学科在此后的进展便一直和殖民扩张紧密相连。人类学在中国的开端，一般被追溯到蔡元培在1926年发表的《说民族学》，而林耀华、费孝通等学者的实践还要在十数年以后，且都以中国社区为研究对象，和日本的进路迥异。
然而，日本人类学的知识并未隔绝于中国，如鸟居龙藏对中国东三省、西南苗族的调查在当时已引起注意，又如明治日本的人种观念对晚清中国也有深远影响。更为关键的是，要理解给中国带来沉重灾难的日本帝国主义，人类学实为不可或缺的视角——相比于政治学、经济学等学科，人类学知识与近代日本的自我认识及对其他国家和民族的认知有更深的关联，也因此触及日本殖民观念的深层逻辑。相比之下，国内对日本近代人类学史的研究仍显不足（例如2022年出版、张明杰主编的《近代日本学者对华学术调查与研究》一书，仍以属于日本“东洋史”知识范围的调查为主，较少触及人类学田野调查）。本文拟介绍日本学者撰写的日本人类学史近著两种，以供感兴趣的同仁参考。
坂野彻的《帝国日本与人类学者：1884-1952》2005年由劲草书房出版，中生胜美的《近代日本的人类学史：帝国和殖民地记忆》2017年由风响社出版，是近年来日本人类学史领域最为翔实的著作，也都极具批…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[With this standalone compiler, you can rely on all Java 11 javac features to be available, even when using newer Java versions. Specifically, this allows you to:
- compile code even if your Java environment isn't a full JDK (Java JRE, for example!)
- target Java 1.7 for compilation without any warnings or restrictions.
- use the Compiler Tree API without resorting to --add-opens trickery that may eventually fail in newer Java releases
- build a modified compiler with additional features or custom tweaks
I made this after finding that the otherwise superb "jsweet" Java-to-JavaScript transpiler failed to build and run with Java 16 or newer. Surprisingly, I couldn't find any prior work other than "proper" standalone compilers like Eclipse's ecj that would properly work with modern Java runtimes.
I'm excited to see what can be done now that we have this scaffolding.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[据廉洁深圳网消息，日前，深圳市纪委监委对深圳市原交通局货运管理分局局长钟庚赐严重违纪违法问题进行了立案审查调查。


经查，钟庚赐对党不忠诚不老实，多次串供对抗组织审查；借机敛财，违规从事营利活动；未经批准，违规兼职取酬；利用职务便利为他人谋取利益，非法收受他人财物。


钟庚赐严重违反党的政治纪律、廉洁纪律，并构成严重职务违法，应予严肃处理。依据《中国共产党纪律处分条例》、《中华人民共和国监察法》、《中华人民共和国公职人员政务处分法》等有关规定，经深圳市纪委常委会会议审议，决定给予钟庚赐开除党籍处分，按二级科员确定其退休待遇；收缴其违纪违法所得。


钟庚赐简历：


钟庚赐，男，汉族，1947年11月生，深圳宝安人，大专学历，1968年2月参加工作，1971年6月加入中国共产党。

【此前报道】


“我只知道我家里有9位数，我想混哪个平台就混哪个平台，想在哪个国家就在哪个国家。”


2023年3月，网友“北极鲶鱼”在公共社交平台发消息称，其家里存款超过9位数，爷爷是深圳市交通运输局局长。


上述言论及相关照片经过广泛传播后，“北极鲶鱼”被网友质疑不仅炫富，还涉嫌侮辱国人，其口中的“爷爷”及其亲属极有可能涉嫌贪腐。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[GNOME 的桌面环境中隐藏着丰富的搜索特性，爱探索的你不妨尝试寻找。挖掘新知，将是一场乐趣无穷的旅程。


在我之前的 一篇文章 中，分享过在 Nautilus 文件管理器中如何掌握搜索的技巧。

在这次的教程中，我将介绍 GNOME 活动区域中一些被忽视的搜索功能。

如果 “GNOME 活动GNOME Activities” 这个术语你并不熟悉，你可以在 GNOME 桌面环境的左上角找到并点击 “活动Activities” 按钮，进入相应界面。



你也可以通过按下 Super 键（即：Windows 键）来快速访问。



尽管 GNOME 内置了强大的搜索功能，但大部分人却仅仅用它来搜索和运行应用。



而实则，它还有更多的功能等待你去探索，这些可能在你使用过程中派上大用场，同时让你带上专业用户的范儿。

就让我们逐个介绍这些隐藏功能吧。

1、全局文件搜索

这个功能和打开应用非常类似。当你在搜索区域开始输入，你会发现搜索结果在不断的变化。如果有文件与你的搜索关键词匹配上，你可以点击文件名，也可以按回车，以默认的应用打开它。



在同一界面中，你可以看到每个文件都有一个小型的预览。并且，列表中的每个文件都会标注其完整路径。

如果你细看，你会发现这里有一个文件管理器的图标，点击它。



点击后，会打开 Nautilus 文件管理器，并进入搜索模式，你可以看到所有匹配到的文件。



同样的，如果你点击了搜索结果中的某个应用图标，将打开这个应用，并同时展示相应的搜索结果。


💡 如果你已经安装了 GNOME Sushi，你甚至可以在开始使用这些文件前，使用全屏模式预览它们。


2、复制表情符和特殊字符

GNOME 提供了一个名为 gnome-characters 的应用，它包含了许多表情符以及相关字…]]></summary>

a vulnerability in the libcue library (which is used by the GNOME
desktop) that can be exploited by a remote attacker to run code on a
desktop system if the target can be convinced to click on a malicious link.


	The video shows me clicking a link in a webpage, which causes a cue
	sheet to be downloaded. Because the file is saved to ~/Downloads,
	it is then automatically scanned by tracker-miners. And because it
	has a .cue filename extension, tracker-miners uses libcue to parse

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[GNOME 开始正式放弃 X11 会话支持

随着 Fedora 40 希望禁用 GNOME 的 X11 会话支持，上游的 GNOME 开始评估禁用和移除其 X11 会话支持的前景。GNOME 开启了一组合并请求，开始放弃对 GNOME 桌面的 X11 会话支持，一旦这些代码被移除，GNOME 将成为仅支持 Wayland 的桌面环境。在这第一步中仅移除了 systemd 启动目标，但 X11 功能仍然存在。随后的其它合并请求将真正删除大约 3.6 千行的 X11 会话代码。GNOME 称，“X11 接受的测试越来越少。自 2016 年以来，我们一直默认使用 Wayland 会话，现在是时候彻底放弃 x11 会话了。”此外，Fedora 40 也将只支持 KDE Plasma 6 的 Wayland 会话。


消息来源：Phoronix



老王点评：随着 Fedora 的推动，在 GNOME 和 KDE 的支持下，X11 将被扫到历史的垃圾堆中。




“Admin123” 是最大的网络安全错误配置漏洞

根据从红蓝队演习中获得的数据，美国网络安全和基础设施安全局（CISA）和美国国家安全局（NSA）将在软件、系统和应用程序中坚持使用默认凭据列为 十大网络安全错误配置 之首。排名第二的是用户和管理员权限分离不当，第三是网络监控不足。采用安全设计和默认安全的方法，是美国政府近年来最明确、宣传最多的目标之一。他们鼓励技术制造商停止生产存在已知可利用漏洞的产品，并制定法案禁止购买存在任何已知漏洞的软件，虽然一些专家批评该法案限制过多。


消息来源：The Register



老王点评：网络安全已经不是增强功能，而是必备的基础功能了。




LXC 发布 LXD 的社区分支 Incus 0.1

八月份，在 Canonical 决定 接管 LXD 之后，LXC 社区将 LXD 项目分叉为 Incus。上周末，Incus 软件发布了第一个正式版本 0.1。Incus 0.1 大致相当于 LXD 5.18 版本，在此基础上做了各种改动，删除了一些未使用或有问题的功能。有一个值得注意的变化是，用 /dev/incus 代替 /dev/lxd 设备。


消息来源：Phoronix



老王点评：脱开企业的束缚，就是新生的开始。而且，两个同源的竞争品也有助于更好的发展。]]></summary>

2023年3月24日，为纪念阿尔帖亭洞窟屠杀惨案发生七十九周年，意大利现任总统塞尔焦·马塔雷拉等人出席了在罗马郊外举行的哀悼仪式。然而并未出席这一仪式的意大利现任总理、右翼联盟意大利兄弟党主席焦尔吉娅·梅洛尼的致辞却引发争议。当她表示“这次大屠杀是我们国家所遭受的最深痛的创伤之一：三百三十五名无辜的意大利人仅仅因为他们是意大利人而遭到屠杀”，多位意大利政治人物第一时间抨击了这一言论。“不，梅洛尼总理，三百三十五人在阿尔帖亭洞窟被屠杀并不只是因为他们是意大利人，”绿色左翼联盟议员尼古拉·弗拉托扬尼在推特上写道，“因为他们是意大利人、反法西斯人士、犹太人、游击队员，反法西斯（ANTIFASCISTA）才是关键。”（相关原文引自安莎社[ANSA]2023年3月24日报道：Fosse Ardeatine, Meloni: "335 italiani innocenti massacrati solo perché italiani". Anpi e opposizioni attaccano）
尽管阿尔帖亭洞窟的硝烟早已散尽，但几十年间，围绕这一悲惨事件的争论与争议始终未曾断绝。其中既有如梅洛尼总理发言引出的受害者身份问题，亦有滥用这一事件的细节煽动仇恨情绪的恶劣做法，如2007年12月意大利政客吉奥乔·贝蒂奥在谈论移民问题时公开表示，“若移民伤害意大利公民，我们不妨采取纳粹党卫军当年的手段，让他们以十抵一”（路透社[Reuters]2007年12月5日报道：Italy politician urges Nazi policies for immigrants）。他谈论的正是纳粹炮制阿尔帖亭洞窟屠杀所遵循的报复命令——当1944年3月23日意大利抵抗组…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Cloudflare 最终提出了一种可结束视觉难题的解决方案。


自 去年 以来，Cloudflare 一直在研发一种更加注重隐私的验证码（CAPTCHA）替代系统。

可恶的验证码（尤其是谷歌的 reCAPTCHA）的问题是其无必要地收集用户数据、延迟体验时间、在网络导航中造成不便。

当然，验证码在一定程度上具有其用处。如果我声称它一无是处，无疑会显得无知。然而，随着技术的发展，以及为了提供无缝体验，我们所有的 隐私保护工具 都在不断进步，我们也需要一个连贯的系统来保护网站免受机器人的侵扰。

令人感兴趣的是，Cloudfare 设法整合了一项每个人都可以免费使用作为替代品的技术，那就是Cloudflare Turnstile。和每个 Cloudflare 的产品一样，你可以得到一个 "Enterprise" 计划，能够移除其品牌标识，并做一些其他操作。

Cloudflare Turnstile：彻底摆脱验证码！

有了 Cloudflare Turnstile，你将永远不再需要解答任何视觉难题。

一开始，即使是它的自家隐私优先的验证码系统也会向部分用户展示难题。

现在，所有这些都已被他们的新产品替换。你只需进行一次点击，就可以验证你是人类：



为了确保隐私保护目标的实现，Cloudflare 作出了以下说明：


我们创立 Turnstile 就是为了保护隐私。Turnstile 达到了 电子隐私指令ePrivacy Directive、GDPR 及 CCPA 的合规性要求，也符合我们自己严格的隐私承诺。此外，Cloudflare 的 FedRAMP Moderate 授权套餐、"Cloudflare for Government" 现在也包括 Turnstile。我们并不依赖于追踪用户数据，比如用户访问过其他哪些网站，来判断用户是人还是机器人。我们的业务是保护网站，而不是卖广告，因此，运营商可以放心部署 Turnstile，知道他们的用户数据安全无虞。


此外，Cloudflare 认为，即使不向用户提供任何交互元素，它也能比现有的验证码系统更有效。它可以保护网站免受机器人流量，以及欺诈行为的侵害。

所以，有些人可能甚至不会看到人类验证的挑战，因为 Cloudflare 已经通过后台进行了一系列的检查和分析以发现可疑行为。

有什么更让人兴奋的吗？



所有这些都是免费提供的。任何不使用 Cloudflare 作为防火墙或 CDN 的网站或平台，只需添加几行代码，即可选择使用本服务。


Cloudflare Turnstile


你还可以按照官方 文档 的指南，从 reCAPTCHA 或 hCAPTCHA 迁移到该系统。

欲了解更多技术信息，你可以查看 Cloudflare 的公告。

💬 你如何评价 Cloudflare 的新系统，能在无需验证码的情况下阻挡机器人并提升用户体验呢？

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[我遇到 “找不到 man 命令” 错误的小插曲，以及我是如何解决的。


多年后，我再次尝试 Arch Linux。我忘记了 pacman 命令的用法，所以我尝试访问它的手册页。

接下来发生的事情让我震惊（是的！我一直在阅读 BuzzFeed 😜）。它向我展示了这个错误：


bash: man: command not found


当然，这不仅是 pacman，所有命令都是这样。



这让我感到困惑，因为我以前从未遇到过无法使用 man 命令的情况。

如果你发现自己处于找不到 man 命令的类似情况，我向你保证，修复很简单：


安装 man-db 包（安装手册页）

更新 mandb 缓存（用于索引所有命令的手册页）


让我们更详细地看看。

在 Linux 中安装手册页

我从未想过我必须明确安装手册页。但是 Arch Linux 将你带入未知领域。这在某种程度上是件好事，因为你会发现以前从未遇到过的事情。

这里的关键是安装手册页的包名为 man-db。这对我来说也是一个发现。

你可以使用发行版的包管理器来安装它。

对于 Arch 和 Manjaro，使用：

sudo pacman -S man-db




对于 Ubuntu 和 Debian，请使用：

sudo apt install man-db


对于 Fedora，请使用：

sudo dnf install man-db


对于 Red Hat Linux，请使用：

sudo yum install man-db


你明白了要点。为手册页构建缓存也是明智的一步。

构建手册页缓存

要刷新或构建手册页缓存，请运行 mandb 命令：

sudo mandb


它将在不同位置查找手册页并构建缓存，以便你可以快速访问手册页。



完成后，我就可以像往常一样使用 man 命令。

结论

这确实让我感到震惊，因为我一直认为手册页是 Linux 的核心部分。从未想过我必须安装它们。

我应该将其添加到 安装 Arch Linux 后要做的事情列表 吗？我还没有把握。

也许我是在 Arch 中遇到这个缺少 man 命令问题的极少数用户之一。也许不是。如果你遇到过这样的“意外错误”，请在评论中告诉我。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Linux Containers project has
announced
the release version 0.1 of the Incus system container and
virtual-machine manager, which is a community-led fork of Canonical's LXD.   Incus 0.1 "is roughly
equivalent to LXD 5.18 but with a number of breaking changes on top of the
obvious rename".  There have been some changes made in the two months
since the fork:

With this initial release of Incus, we took the opportunity to remove a lot
of unused or problematic features from LXD. Most of those changes are
things we would have liked to do in LXD but couldn’t due to having strong
guarantees around backward compatibility. 

Incus will be similarly strict with backward compatibility in the future,
but as this is the first release of the fork, it was our one big
opportunity to change things. 

That said, the API and CLI are still extremely close to what LXD has,
making it trivial if not completely seamless to port from LXD to Incus.


There is an online
version of Incus for those interested in giving it a try.]]></summary>

merge window was multi-grain timestamps, which allow the kernel to
selectively store file modification times with higher resolution without
hurting performance.  Unfortunately, this feature also caused some
surprising regressions, and was quickly ushered back out of the kernel as a
result.  It is instructive to look at how this feature went wrong, and how
the developers involved plan to move forward from here.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hej fellow tuxers,
 tl;dr: How do you ensure you haven't forgotten anything crucial when reinstalling?
 I am actually quite fluent with linux and have undertaken several reinstalls without too much of a hassle. The tendential centralization of my data in one spot (and linking them via stow) has ensured that I don't run into trouble regarding the data I use on the regular. 
 However, with an imminent reinstall I wonder how to make sure that I haven't forgotten about something I'd sorely miss in the event that it's gone. So far, I've dealt with this issue by just purchasing a new sdd when reinstalling and just keeping what's on the old one for later - hoping that bitrot will not eventually make it impossible to plug in the old device or losing the overview and at some point simply not knowing where to look for.
 Thus, I'd like to hear about your strategies to not get lost when you are about to reinstall a new machine. For now, I've settled on (again) throwing money at the problem, but I'd love to not have to do this at some point rather sooner than later.
 Have a good day!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[谷歌开源了一个键帽形键盘，摇头输入

“键帽”，当然也是一种帽子。谷歌日本公司为那些愿意用头来输入的人设计了一套“键帽”键盘。这个设计是为了推广谷歌的 Gboard 应用程序。在这个“键帽”里有一个 6 轴惯性传感器，可以读取帽子的定位。佩戴者左右转动帽子，每个角度代表一个不同的字符代码。然后，佩戴者可以按下帽子顶部来输入字符。键盘通过蓝牙与设备连接，并支持 USB-C 充电。不过，谷歌并没有生产这款产品，只是制造了原型产品，并开源了其软硬件设计，所以你可以自己 DIY 一个。

老王点评：名副其实的“键帽”，键和帽都有了，所有担心自己颈椎问题的程序员们都需要一顶。😉




密码学家悬赏寻找 5 个 NIST 椭圆曲线丢失的种子

NIST 的椭圆曲线是由美国国家安全局（NSA）在 90 年代末提供的散列种子生成的，它为现代密码学提供了大量动力。有传言说，这些种子是某些英语句子的哈希值，但挑选这些种子的 Jerry Solinas 博士于 2023 年初去世，这留下了一个密码学之谜，生成这些哈希值的种子是什么。密码学家 Filippo Valsorda 宣布为破解这五个哈希值提供 12288 美元的赏金！

下面是这五个种子的哈希值：

对埃德蒙·伯克（Edmund Burke）而言，1789年不是一个好年景。他殚精竭虑推动的沃伦·黑斯廷斯弹劾案正成为一桩不得人心的事业。这场始于1786年的对东印度公司前任负责人的弹劾曾赢得议会和民众的满堂喝彩，伯克在议会的滔滔雄辩激起了英国本土对东印度腐败和暴政的普遍忧虑。然而。随着政治热点的转移和议会选举的换届，无论黑斯廷斯还是伯克，都因为这场历时甚久的弹劾而筋疲力尽。即便怀有强烈的道德责任感，迈入花甲之年的伯克也开始悲观地认为，这场濒临失败的弹劾案将成为他政治生命的最后一笔。辞去下议院议员的想法，已经萦绕在他的脑中。
历史往往会以出人意料的方式改变某些人的命运，1789年的法国大革命就是如此。随着大革命的爆发，越来越多的辉格党人将这场革命视为英国进一步变革的先声。作为美洲革命的坚定支持者，伯克也被大革命支持者视为理所当然的同盟。潘恩甚至多次前往伯克的庄园，请求其公开支持法国大革命。伯克以含糊其辞的方式回避这一问题。等到一年之后，《法国革命论》的发表使得他与昔日盟友分道扬镳。在法国革命的初期，伯克依旧留在辉格党内，但他与党内日益增长的法国革命同情论者之间产生难以弥合的分歧。这场决裂以他跨过议会过道，从反对派议席坐到时为托利党首相的小威廉·皮特身旁宣告结束。这意味着他不再是福克斯派辉格党人，也与法国革命的支持者彻底划清了界限。
伯克的分裂态度引发对其政治一致性的质疑。反对者将伯克视为典型的政治投机分子，支持者视伯克为政治灵活性的体现。这是一场直到今日都没有平息的争论。而理查德·伯克（Richard Bourke）所撰写的《帝国与革命：埃德蒙·伯克的政治生涯》则是帮助我们理解伯克的一个重要抓手。作为严肃的历史学家，…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Pomatez 应用可以提升你的效率，它为你的时间管理带来了巨大帮助。


你是否对 “番茄工作法” 有所了解呢？

这是一种 时间管理方法，于 1980 年代末期开发，通过定时器将工作划分为一定的时间间隔，每间隔 25 分钟后进行短暂的休息，如此循环直至任务完成。

这种方法在近些年变得越来越流行，有很多应用程序以 番茄工作法Pomodoro Technique 作为主要的卖点。

这里我们将介绍一个采用这种方法的应用，它名为 “Pomatez”，并且是 原生支持 Linux 平台的开源应用。Pomatez 为时间管理提供了所需的全部工具。

其实这并不是我们第一次介绍这种应用，之前有一种应用叫 “Reminders”，功能类似，但并未采用番茄工作法。


Reminders：一个漂亮的开源 Linux 应用，可帮助你完成工作


现在我来详述一下你可以用 Pomatez 应用做些什么。

Pomatez: 概述 ⭐



Pomatez 使用 TypeScript 编程语言编写，是一款极好的工具，能让你在执行重要任务的同时安排适时的休息，保持专注。

Pomatez 的关键特性包括：


内置的任务列表

桌面通知

可定制的规则


初次使用感受 👨‍💻

我在我的 Ubuntu 22.04 LTS 系统上安装了它，体验了它的功能表现。

首先，我在 “任务列表Task List” 部分填充了一些当日必须完成的重要任务和一些不太重要的任务。

一切就绪后，你将不会感到失望的 👇



然后，我进入 “配置Config” 栏，按照自己的喜好进行了规则调整。

“保持专注Stay focus” 为执行任务的时间长度，“短暂休息Short break” 为短暂的休息时间，“长休息Long break” 为更长的休息时间，以及 “会话轮次Session rounds” 为定时器的会话数量。

这里还有一个 “特殊休息Special Breaks” 部分，可以用来安排比如午餐、晚餐的特定休息时间。



接下来，我进入 “计时器Timer” 栏，此处显示了首个待处理任务，一列显示的是会话数以及控制定时器/会话的选项。

这里有一个重置定时器的按钮，一个开始/停止定时器的按钮，一个按规则进入下一阶段的按钮，一个调节音量的按钮，以及一个切换至 “精简模式Compact mode”（位于右下角）的按钮。



我按下 “开始” 按钮启动了定时器，并开始查看了任务的可执行操作。我可以标记任务为 “完成Done”，跳过任务，或者从应用中删除任务。



随着任务的推进，我通过按下带一个框和向下箭头图标的按钮，将 Pomatez 切换到了 “精简模式Compact mode”。

这样我得到了一个更小巧的，节省空间的界面。当我完成任务后，我停止了计时器并将任务标记为 “完成Done”。



随后，我转到 “设置Settings” 栏，看看我可以调整哪些选项，我发现它给我了不少惊喜。

我可以调整应用行为，如设置为 “始终在顶部Always On Top”， 启用“深色主题Dark Theme” 和 “语音助手Voice Assiastance” 等。



Pomatez 还支持键盘快捷键，虽然我期望它能提供通过键盘快捷键控制计时器的功能。

或许他们可以考虑在未来的版本中参考我的反馈意见？我希望他们可以！



总体而言，如果你希望改进日常工作流程，这款应用值得尝试。

最好的是，它是一个跨平台的应用，不仅可以在 Linux 所有现代发行版上运行，你在 Windows 和 macOS 系统上也可以试用。

📥 下载 Pomatez

Pomatez 提供了 Linux 平台的 .deb、AppImage 和 .rpm 安装包。你还可以找到它的 Snap 包。

你可以从官方网站，Snap 商店 或其在 GitHub 上的仓库获取你需要的包。

 Changelog:
  
Improve Wayland support, cursor/clipboard/multi-monitors etc, but highly depends on Xwayland, working well on GNOME, bad compatibility on KDE. We will continue working on Wayland
 Add group tab
 Add software update check based on github latest tag
 Some fixes for Kaspersky compliance, #5624, but they requested more
 A lot of fixes since 1.2.2
 We are still working hard on dual-monitors-dual-windows and new hardware codecs, hopefully be in 1.2.4

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[在 2018 年的一篇 早前的文章 中，我们介绍了在升级 Fedora Linux 前如何利用 LVM 复制根文件系统，以便在可能出现错误的情况下能有一个回退机制。然而如今，Fedora 工作站的默认安装已经是 Btrfs 文件系统了。现在，你可以利用 Btrfs 快照来更简便地创建一个可引导的回退系统。注意，本文不涉及会如何从其它文件系统转换或迁移到 Btrfs 上。

确认根文件系统是否为 Btrfs

本示例采用的是 Pinebook aarch64 笔记本电脑。在开始前，务必确认你的根文件系统是否采用 Btrfs。要明确，不是所有的定制版或者镜像文件默认都使用 Btrfs。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all,
 Fairly new still to using Linux as a daily driver. I was googling around for some advice on what could be a good markdown editor to use for some writing projects I had in mind and I came across Ghostwriter. I installed it, but it took some time to install. The long waiting got me thinking: how does one know if they are installing something malicious? There are so many packages I just install from the terminal and I never really think twice about it. How can you be sure what you are installing is legit?
 ​
 Here is the ghostwriter website in case you all want to check it out: https://ghostwriter.kde.org/

 Tinkerbox
 Tinkerbox is a tool to manage interactive podman containers for experiments and development.
 It is like toolbox and distrobox, but does not share directories with host.
 Work in progress, but useable.
 Read code for instructions or call tinkerbox --help.
 Persistent volumes
 Tinkerbox mounts two persistent volumes for each container:
  
<boxname>-home to /home
 tinkerbox-shared to /mnt/shared
  
The last one is shared between containers and intended to be used to store different kind of caches like ~/.cache/pip.
 Make a symbolic link for your cache directory to this volume. bash mkdir -p /mnt/shared/…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[ls 属于 Linux 中那些简单又常用的命令之一。在本教程里，你将学到如何高效使用它。


对我个人而言，ls 无疑是 最常被使用的 Linux 命令，因为我们总是借助它 列出目录内的内容 来检验上一步操作的结果。

ls 命令是 “列表List” 的缩写，其功能就是列出你指定目录下的所有内容。

我将在本教程中，通过一系列的实例，带你一步步掌握 ls 命令的使用。

另外也会给出一些练习题，以检验你的学习成果。

如何运用 ls 命令

要使用 ls 命令，你只需遵循以下简单的命令格式：

ls [OPTIONS] Targeted_Directory


这里，


[OPTIONS]：用来改变 ls 命令的默认行为。

Targeted_Directory：在这里输入目录名或目录的绝对路径。


你可能会想，如果没有任何选项地使用 ls 命令会发生什么。为了回答这个问题，我在当前工作目录中使用了 ls 命令：



如你所见，它列出了当前工作目录中所有可用的目录和文件。但你可以做的远不止于在当前工作目录中获取名称和文件。

接下来让我给你展示一下。

1、列出带有所有权的文件和目录

ls 命令的重要用途之一就是查出具体的文件或目录的权限以及所有权信息。

这就需要你在使用 ls 命令时，带上 -l 选项（这也被称为长列表格式）：

ls -l


执行该命令后，你会看到类似的输出：

$ ls -lh
-rwxrw-r-- 1 sagar sagar 666M Dec 10 18:16 Fedora.iso


注意到我是同时使用了 –h 选项吗？我们稍后会详细说明这个。

如果目前为止的输出结果看起来太复杂，那就让我来帮你简化一下：



如你所见，每个文本块都有特定的含义，它们分别对应文件拥有者、组…]]></summary>

美国参众两院的几名议员以美国国家安全为由敦促美国政府对 RISC-V 相关技术的出口实施限制。议员们担心，中国正在利用美国公司之间的开放合作文化来推动中国半导体产业的发展，这可能会削弱美国目前在芯片领域的领先地位。他们认为，中国正在“滥用 RISC-V 来规避美国在芯片设计所需知识产权方面的主导地位”。总部位于美国加利福尼亚的 RISC-V 初创公司 SiFive 公司说，美国政府对美国公司在 RISC-V 的潜在限制将是一个 “巨大的悲剧”。

仅有 10% 的人主要将 Python 用于开发系统管理脚本

由 Python 软件基金会和 JetBrains 开展的 2022 年度 Python 开发者调查报告刚刚发布。当被问及 Python 最常用于什么用途时，22% 的人用于 Web 开发，18% 的人用于数据分析，12% 的人用于机器学习，只有 10% 的人用于 DevOps/系统管理/编写自动化脚本。此外，报告显示，93% 的受访者采用了 Python 3，但仍有 7% 的受访者在使用 Python 2。而在上一年度的调查中，这一比例为 5%，略有回升。在受访者中，51% 的人表示他们在工作和个人/教育用途或副业项目中使用 Python，85% 的受访者表示 Python 是他们的主要语言。

老王点评：Python 难道不是运维人员最爱的语言吗？看起来它的用户群体已经发生了很大变化。所以，即便你不是运维，也该学习一下 Python 了。




澳大利亚科学家用《帝国时代》 游戏模拟蚂蚁战争

在澳大利亚各地，已经有 50 种不同的入侵蚂蚁，包括电蚁、火蚁和黄疯蚁，为了消灭它们，已经花费了数亿美元。为了更好地了解本地蚂蚁和外来入侵蚂蚁之间的斗争，澳大利亚国家科学机构的科学家们利用微软的经典电脑游戏《帝国时代》来模拟蚂蚁战争。研究人员称，“蚂蚁是少数几个在战争规模和死亡率方面与人类战争相似的动物物种群体之一。”他们认为该工作有助于开发新的栖息地管理方法，比如在城市化环境中增加灌木丛或更复杂的环境，使竞争的天平重新倾向于本地蚂蚁。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Gamerzilla 是一个开源游戏成就系统，用于存储和共享你的游戏成就。游戏使用 libgamerzilla 轻松添加成就。Gamerzilla 库是用 C 编写的，但也有其他语言的绑定。

两年前，我描述了如何设置 Gamerzilla 服务器。除了 .net 实现之外，还可以使用 php 和 python 实现。但你可能不想运行自己的服务器。这里介绍一个公共服务器和 Gnome 界面。

公共服务器

我的网络服务器现在托管了一个启用了公共注册的 Gamerzilla 实例。要创建帐户，请单击右上角的 “签到Sign In” 链接。然后单击 “登录Login” 按钮旁边的 “注册Register” 链接。

用户帐户收集的信息非常少。只需输入用户名和密码。你不需要输入你的真实姓名或电子邮件地址。因此，忘记密码没有实现。

账户一开始是不可见的。如果你希望公众在登录后看到你的成就，请单击页面右上角你的用户名，然后选择 “设为可见Make Visible”。新用户必须经过批准才能上传成就。目前没有显示你是否获得批准的指示。

获得成就

在获得第一个成就之前，你需要使用以下命令安装 Gamerzilla GNOME Shell 扩展：

sudo dnf install gnome-shell-extension


安装后，你需要注销并重新登录。需要使用以下命令启用扩展：

gnome-extensions enable gamerzilla@gamerzilla.identicalsoftware.com


游戏控制器图标出现在 GNOME Shell 的顶部栏中。

单击控制器图标并选择 “首选项preferences”。在出现的屏幕上输入你的 Gamerzilla 网址，包括尾部斜杠，但不包含 UI 的“奖杯”地址。如果使用我的服务器，该值将为 https://identicalsoftware.com/。填写你的用户名和密码。单击保存。默认情况下启用自动连接。如果你不想始终连接，请禁用此功能。



不幸的是，一个错误阻止了该 Shell 扩展立即工作。你需要注销并重新登录。解决这个问题是当务之急。

目前支持的游戏

Fedora 仓库中的多个游戏支持 Gamerzilla 成就。如果你想买一个来尝试一下，我建议试试 Shippy 1984、Seahorse Adventures 或 Anagramarama。一旦你完成一个级别，Seahorse Adventures 就会存储一些进度。如果你玩 Super Tux Kart，你可能已经取得了成就。只需启动游戏即可同步之前完成的任何成就。当成就完成时，Gamerzilla 不会显示任何通知，但游戏可能会自行实现。

更进一步

除了修复第一次连接的错误之外，我还想要一个本地浏览器来查看成就。这样你就可以查看所有游戏成就，而无需强制上传它们。

成就确实有消极的一面。有些人觉得有必要完成它们。如果成就非常困难，这可能会导致负面的游戏体验。我理解这种担忧，但有些人也喜欢这些方面。更重要的是，为了吸引和留住玩家，我觉得开源游戏需要一个游戏成就系统。

我们需要更多游戏来实现 Gamerzilla 成就。我们需要玩家表现出对这个系统的支持。我继续为我的游戏和我尝试的其他开源游戏添加成就。

Both feel leagues better than any other distro I've ever used. NixOS is virtually unbreakable. I've had it survive power outages while updating and it handled it like it was like nothing. Try some weird configuration and fuck up your system? Well, that's just a simple nixos-rebuild switch --rollback and you're back to a pristine system. Heck, you can even mess up your kernel and all it takes to fix it is a reboot and selecting an older generation from the boot menu. The Nix way feels genuinely technologically superior to the traditional linux desktop.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[中国石油大学副教授饶胜文先生长期从事军事历史、军事地理及战略思想文化研究，所著《布局天下：中国古代军事地理大势》对中国古代军事地理形势做了全面而深入的分析。而他的《大汉帝国在巴蜀：蜀汉天命的振扬与沉坠》则从政治哲学的角度，分析、解读了三国时蜀汉政权的兴衰脉络。借着此书最近重版的机会，《上海书评》采访了饶胜文，请他谈谈蜀汉的天命这一话题。

饶胜文（章静 绘）


《大汉帝国在巴蜀》，饶胜文著，后浪｜北京联合出版公司2023年2月出版，440页，96.00元

之前读到《布局天下》，对您在军事地理上的造诣深感佩服，这本《大汉帝国在巴蜀》讨论了不少军事地理相关问题，但是跟《布局天下》的“画风”又很不一样，那么，这两本著作之间存在关联吗？
饶胜文：这两本书之间没有直接关联，更多地反映出了我阅读、思考的兴趣的一种推移。上世纪八九十年代我读本科，男读金庸、女看琼瑶是一股校园潮流，而我则是把军事史、战争史当作武侠来读，沉醉其中，难以自拔。后来我有机会去武大进修经济方面的课程，却在那儿读了一年杂书，兴趣慢慢从战争史转移到国际政治，开始关注为什么一战、二战会发展到冷战，为什么一个国家本来下决心要击溃另一个国家，后来又反而要去重建它这一类问题。这也让我觉得，跟政治的智慧相比，战争的智慧没有那么高级。写《布局天下》算是对军事史的阅读做一个了结。
后来，我和几个朋友读政治哲学，从马基雅维利一直读到列奥·施特劳斯。倒也没有想做这方面的学术研究，而是作为知识储备，打开一种视野。但具备这方面的视野之后，回头再看中国古代典籍，如《尚书》中汤武革命的那些诰、誓，我不禁感叹：这不就是中国古典的政治哲学吗？这也随即打开了我在政治史方面的眼界，此后我再读《资治通鉴》，读到诸如三国袁绍攻打曹操时手下谋士拿“武王伐纣”来类比，或者诸葛亮声称北伐是“恭行天罚”，就不再像以前那样觉得只是“虚文”，而是有了更深层次的理解…]]></summary>

 Just putting this out there because I stumbled on this in the comment section of phoronix and I have a 6650u laptop that has this problem. Past attempts to google solutions to this have lead me to other bugs which are noteworthy, but Ive had this laptop over a year and had no idea vp9 was a culprit.
 In a nutshell vp9 is weird on rembrant. It freezes, it stutters, it holds a single frame a few seconds too long, and it impacts hardware acceleration. Quick search shows setting boot parameter amd_iommu=off does the trick and just did a test which shows, while its not perfect I can play a 4k60fps youtube video at 2x speed relatively smoothly. You can also use an extention like enhance h264ify to just disable vp9. 
 For future people coming in from google Im just going to add in some search terms: rembrant, amd, ryzen, 6600u,6800u, 6650u , 6850u, ryzen freezes, youtube freeze, frame, laggy youtube, youtube studders when playing videos, linux, ubuntu,fedora, archlinux.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[对于 Ubuntu 和其相关版本如 Kubuntu 的选择可能会令人迷惑。那就让我们简化这个选择过程吧。


Ubuntu 是桌面用户最选择的 Linux 发行版。其特色是一个定制的 GNOME 桌面，可以提供流畅的用户体验。振奋人心！

而另一方面，Kubuntu 是 Ubuntu 发行版家族 中的一员，特色在于其 KDE Plasma 桌面。

本质上，这两种发行版非常类似，主要区别在于 桌面环境。

那么，它二者有何明显不同点？是否一个比另外一个更好？对于你来说，何种发行版更为适合？

接下来，我们将比较下它们之间的主要不同，并提供一些基本信息以助你做出选择。


📋 本篇文章的对比依据是 Ubuntu 23.04 以及 Kubuntu 23.04。随着未来版本的发布，可能会有一些变动，我们也会持续进行更新。


桌面环境

Ubuntu 的特色在于使用了 GNOME 桌面的定制外观。对于新的 Linux 用户来说，这个布局独特且易用。



它并不与 Fedora Linux 的原生 GNOME 体验完全相同。Ubuntu 的桌面环境体验经过了一些改动。

Kubuntu 提供了原生的 KDE Plasma 体验。对于从 Windows 平台转换来的用户，布局会感到相当熟悉，包含开始菜单、系统小工具等等。



如果你尝试过任何其他带有 KDE Plasma 桌面的发行版，其体验应该差不多。

它们都是一些极为出色的 桌面环境，所以，你基于各种布局、定制性和特性选择它们中的哪一个都没有什么问题。

为了进行更多的参考，下面是 Ubuntu 的登录页面所呈现的样子：



接下来，我们看一下带有 X11 桌面会话的 Kubuntu 登录屏幕：



此外，我为你提供了一份详细的指南，如果你想深入研究，可以参考这份 KDE …]]></summary>

But this got me thinking, if somehow MS actually moving forward with this and get more strict with the no license user like Office where it's basically unusable and not just a watermark at the corner of the screen. Obviously they would never do this since they desperately need the market share, and the corporates will still using it since all their stuffs tied to Windows for too long to moving to another OS. But for a normal user will they pick Linux or they just pick Mac since it's more popular

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I feel like desktop Linux has gotten really good recently, and software needs aside, I do believe it's a serious contender to Windows and macOS in the desktop space more so than it has ever been. I've been using Linux on and off for the past 5/6 years, and for the first time I feel I've truly been able to stick with it and use it seriously as a desktop OS
 Things that are just so good:
  
KDE and GNOME are excellent desktop experiences and ecosystems. I go back and forth as to which one I like more (using KDE at the moment), but I appreciate GNOME's unique workflow (it feels like a handcrafted experience for Linux) and attention to detail, whilst I appreciate KDE's feature set and design language (Breeze as a design system is underrated imo). But overall, imo, the desktop experience on most Linux DE's is better than Windows, and in the case of KDE and GNOME, better than macOS.
 There's an excellent set of apps in both the KDE and GNOME ecosystems. KDE has a better set of 1st party apps, but GNOME's Circle program is amazing and has a lot of unique and useful apps.
 It just works, and it stays out of the way. I don't have to deal with random glitches or crashes, or driver issues like on Windows.
 Gaming on Linux is more viable than ever - for the most part, games that don't need anti-cheat just work.
  
In general, as for things that I feel could still be better, the only major thing I can think of is the support for proprietary apps like MS Office or Adobe, but even then Office Online exists (even if it isn't as good) and I know that Adobe is working on Photoshop Online. But honestly, overall, I just really like the desktop Linux experience in 2023 and I hope it keeps getting better. I seriously can't see myself going back to Windows or macOS any time soon.

 The main reason I think this is going to happen is that Windows is just a mess. Every new version they add another UI layer but leave everything underneath, presumably for compatibility reasons. It's ridiculous that there are so many different settings that you can only get at by going on an archeological expedition through ancient UI.

        <id>https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37804200</id>
        <link href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/timbre-sounds-and-sleep/id6450439150"/>
        <updated>2023-10-07T18:23:13.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey all, I'm currently a solo iOS developer who just released my first app, Timbre, onto the App Store (iPhone only for now). Here's a demo to show you how it works: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALoPAFb31Bk.
Timbre originally came about because I wanted to build a sleep sounds & sleep tracker app. I had used Headspace, Calm, Pillow, etc. and figured that instead of paying $70 / year I could just build my own app and pay $100 / year (not a great plan in retrospect). As I started building Timbre, I realized that one of the biggest issues I had with these other apps is that I could never really see which sounds genuinely helped me sleep. With that in mind, I pivoted on my original idea and decided to really hone in on connecting sleep quality and sounds.
Using a custom ML model, Apple's CoreML framework and HealthKit's sleep stage data, I made it so that Timbre could calculate a personal sleep quality score. Therefore, when you record a sleep session while listening to a sound, the app can rank the sounds you've listened to based on your sleep quality scores over time.
Of course, the app also has a smart alarm, offline support, sleep analysis and more, but I'd love to get some feedback & suggestions from the demo video. Also feel free to ask me any questions and I'd be happy to answer them!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[OpenAI 正在考虑自己制造 AI 芯片

OpenAI 正在评估潜在收购目标，考虑自己制造 AI 芯片。OpenAI 的聊天机器人 ChatGPT 运行成本昂贵，分析师估计每次查询的成本为 4 美分。如果 ChatGPT 的查询份额达到谷歌的十分之一，那么 OpenAI 早期阶段需要价值 481 亿美元的 GPU，后续运行每年还需要 160 亿美元的芯片。目前 AI 芯片主要依赖于英伟达的芯片，该公司控制着逾八成的市场份额。


消息来源：路透社



老王点评：我觉得无论是芯片昂贵还是计算成本昂贵的问题，都很快会解决，就像计算机普及一样。




联想推出安卓 PC

安卓系统最常用于手持设备。联想与一家名为 Esper 的公司合作，制造出了一种运行安卓的台式一体机：ThinkCentre M70a。Esper 公司专门从事 Android 系统的定制开发，并提供设备管理服务。ThinkCentre M70a 拥有 21 英寸触摸屏，提供从酷睿 i3 到 i9 的英特尔 CPU，支持最大 16GB DDR4 3200MHz 内存和 512GB PCIe SSD。


消息来源：The Register



老王点评：直接运行 Linux 发行版不好吗？




盖蒂图片公司打造尊重版权的人工智能工具

盖蒂图片公司 CEO 称，为了证明人工智能制造商有可能尊重艺术家的版权，盖蒂建立了一个只使用授权数据的人工智能工具。该公司表示，目前他们还没有一种工具，可以在每次生成人工智能图像时评估哪位艺术家应该获得奖励，但他们会采用一种固定的模型，该模型将决定你的内容在训练集中占多大比例，在生成图像中表现如何，然后根据该模型来奖励创作者。之前，盖蒂起诉 Stability AI，指控该公司的图像生成器“稳定扩散”是在 1200 万张盖蒂图片上训练出来的。


消息来源：Ars Technica



老王点评：想法是好的，但是我认为这种做法是徒劳的，或者说是虚假的模型。因为就目前的 AI 研究进展，很难确定哪个被训练的图片真正起到了多少作用。而如果能够定量分析的话，恐怕也不需要从人类创作的素材学习了。]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Wolfi，这个有趣的项目致力于增强软件供应链的安全性，现已走过一载岁月！


这里说的不是 世界上最小的章鱼，而是一款从这个小章鱼那里汲取灵感的 Linux 发行版。

Wolfi 是一个由社区驱动、以容器为核心的 Linux 发行版，目的在于保护软件供应链的安全性。创造者（Chainguard）将其誉为 “非发行版”。

Wolfi 的目标是解决构建和分发软件时经常遇到的容器问题。

下面我们一起来回顾下 Wolfi 的历程，以及未来的展望。

Wolfi：项目的成就 🐙

自从 Wolfi 去年 开始启动，它已经取得了长足的进步，例如 在 Wolfi 的仓库中具有超过 1300 个包配置 ，并且在 Wolfi 的索引中拥有 超过 18000 的软件包。

有 60 名贡献者参与了这个项目 ，在过去的一年中， 超过 4400 个拉取请求已经成功地合并了 到 Wolfi 在 GitHub 上的仓库中。

此外，他们还保证了 80% 的时间内， 在 GitHub 项目中的 软件包更新间隔少于 24 小时 ，并且还添加了如 Docker Scout 、Snyk 、Wiz 等漏洞扫描工具。

由于 Wolfi 采用了 滚动发布 模式，因此它还致力于为新发现的 CVE 快速提供修复。

综上，这些成就使得他们在以下方面实现了技术创新：


为所有 Wolfi 软件包构建了 64 位 ARM 版本。

对 Go 和 Java 实现了全源引导。

引入了 Rustls TLS 库，用于处理内存安全漏洞。

分发了一个名称为 “wolfi-act” 的新项目，让 Wolfi 包能在 GitHub 操作中动态使用。


你可能会好奇：未来的计划是什么？

好吧，Wolfi 的开发团队希望它能发展成为一个由社区驱动的项目，并有望成为人们最信赖的容器化工作负载发行版。他们还期望 广大开发者都能充分利用 Wolfi 的全部潜力，解决各种问题。

此外，他们还分享了一个 Wolfi 的使用案例：


在当前应用中，Wolfi 的一个清晰的示例是 Chainguard Images —— 这正是我们开始构建该项目的原因。Chainguard Images 只是 Wolfi 实现的许多解决方案之一，我们鼓励更多的用户和社区去探寻 Wolfi 所能搭建出的可能性。


根据他们的新闻发布，他们还提到，在不久的将来 将为 Rust 和其他语言生态系统加入全源引导。

💬 你是否有过用 Wolfi 的经验？你对它的体验是如何的？

当笔者开启又一个暑假追剧之路的时候，从没想到《鹊刀门传奇》会成为这个夏天的爆款。这部宣传不多的赵本山喜剧虽然下饭，但其最大的吸引力无疑不是喜剧而是赵本山，一段表演“掉凳”的短视频就足以引发热议和回忆。不过在赵本山的剧作江湖里，最具代表性的还是《马大帅》，初看是笑、回看是泪。马大帅被命运抛入城乡巨变的时代潮流中，他犹疑躲闪的眼神暗示着城市新移民们走出旧世界后的慌与茫，被他们留在身后的是熟悉的亲友和生活，而迎接他们的则是一个未知的、现代性的神话。赵本山出色地再现了那个春晚舞台上“赵老蔫儿”式憨直又不乏狡黠的老实人形象，演绎着悲剧式的现代寓言——那些来到新世界大门的人们，能否又该如何让自己与大门后的生活和解？

Processes that are non-transparent, inefficient, and full of frustration for both sides. This early iteration has focused on the application tracking aspects with a few extra goodies.
These days it is common to apply to dozens of positions (some users track over a hundred opportunities). Without a record-keeping system, it can quickly become an unmanageable mess. Even the better-organized among us often end up juggling spreadsheets, emails, and various notes. Rolepad was built to keep this data (company facts, role details, interview stages, contact info, freeform notes, follow-up actions, and more) in one place. Some of the other neat additions:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Just go to the link and click on "Start Creating". No signing in required.
I built shortbread to help anyone to create comics / manga series. The onboarding process helps you kick start a page from 60%, then you can use your creativity to bring it to 1000% in a fully-controllable editor.
Tech stack:
GPT 3.5 Turbo  - the comic script generation. It handled everything from layout, character, scene, SD prompts, to dialogue.
SD 1.5  - We put up SD servers on GCP. For every comic we generate one large image and crop it into panels. Per the experiments of u/Deathmarkedadc on Reddit, this massively helps with consistency. The models are trained on anime scenes tho, and might not be so great with animals.
Frontend: Next.js 13 on Vercel, React + Typescript. We built the entire editor from scratch to compose the comic (images, panels, speech bubbles, text) like a webpage. This allows you to edit and republish your comics like a website. 
You can dynamically generate panels as well. Try resizing a panel into a long narrow box and generate.
Backend: Firebase.
Sample comics:
a japanese couple sits at dinner table. The husband told the wife a secret (link https://create.shortbread.ai/viewer/debdf25c-3f95-492a-952a-...)
An army of male soldiers fighting against an army of female soldiers in ancient china (https://create.shortbread.ai/viewer/4566613c-7146-4ed7-9b8d-...)
a team of girls play volleyball against a team of boys (https://create.shortbread.ai/viewer/aafc2f61-d008-4f3f-aa8f-... )
Next steps:
- More pages
- Fine panel-level control. Poses, control net, etc.
- Multi-character.
- Different styles.
-  Allows you to control character design.
I’m Fengjiao Peng, founder and chief engineer at Shortbread. I was previously a webtoon artist. We want to build this into something you can create entire comics series / manga / webtoons with. Criticism and suggestions welcome!

Hey all!
 It's been a while since I've last posted about Celeste, but I thought I'd use the latest update to talk about some of the stuff that's been going on.
 First of all, support for for Proton Drive and pDrive has been added since the last announcement. Proton Drive was something I was seeing interest in by the community, and with the lack of an official client from Proton currently, I'm hoping Celeste can fill in that gap smoothly for anyone who needs it. There was also some requests for pDrive a while back, and that got added due to it not being much work to get going.
 There's also plans for OneDrive support, though it's waiting on some branding stuff to get figured out on Celeste's OneDrive authentication page.
 Celeste also has a brand new logo and icon set (made by a community member) now, and I'm really proud of how they all look. With that and the general feel from Celeste being a native GTK client, I'm aiming straight on for Celeste to be the main file synchronization client for anyone on a Linux desktop.
 Let me know what you think! There's still a lot of work to be done, but things are already kicking off for Celeste to fill in a gap that hasn't been finished before :)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[elementary OS 的精致更新已到来！


2023 年即将结束，而我们得到了一次全新的 elementary OS 更新。今年早些时候，我们对 elementary OS 7 版本进行了概览，该版本带来了众多改进。

而今，让我们来探索一下新发布的 elementary OS 7.1版本。

🆕 elementary OS 7.1: 新增了什么？



作为 最美 Linux 发行版 之一，这次的 elementary OS 发行版主要集中在隐私和辅助功能上。

此版本的一些显著亮点包括：


隐私优化

加强辅助功能

应用中心AppCenter 的改进

手势和键盘导航有所提升


隐私优化



在此发行版中，已引入新系统，用于管理应用程序的自动启动，并且当应用程序在后台运行时会向你发出警告。

因为这个新的 “后台 & 自启动Background & Autostart” 管理面板的引入，现在众多如日历、邮件和任务等核心应用的自启动行为可以得到控制。

该管理面板还负责管理应用程序的权限，其中 “定位服务Location Services” 的管理，采用了一个更安全的方法来允许应用程序请求位置访问。

符合最新的 FreeDesktop.org 标准的实现。

加强辅助功能



收到来自具有视觉障碍用户的反馈后，elementary OS 团队实施了一些有用的可访问性功能。

一项功能是，安装过程中会自动播放 音频提示 ，以让了解用户屏幕阅读器的键盘快捷方式。这个音频提示在首次安装和设置过程中都会提供。

另一项功能是，为了帮助 色觉缺陷 人群在发行版中导航，实施了五种不同的显示过滤器。

这些过滤器是为解决 红色盲、绿色盲 和 黄蓝色盲 这些问题的人们设计的。他们还增添了一些 高对比度选项 ，并增加了大量的 辅助文字。

应用中心的改进



应用中心AppCenter 也有了改进，现在它会显示所有列出或侧载的 Flatpak 应用运行所需的权限。

现在，它可以显示如位置、发送通知、自启动、读/写系统设置等应用权限。

这让用户在安装应用程序时能更清楚地了解哪些权限是必要的。

提升手势和键盘导航



同样地，多点触控手势和键盘导航得到了加强，这归功于在整个系统中更广泛的实施。

现在，用户可以使用手势控制工作区，并使用新添加的各种键盘快捷键导航。对键盘行为的设置也有所优化，提供了大量调整选项。

🛠️ 其他修改和改进

像每个 elementary OS 发布版本一样，许多微妙的改进效果显著。其他的亮点包括：


“文件Files” 应用的标题栏中新增应用菜单，具有新的缩放控制和能同时重命名多个文件的 “批量重命名” 功能。

引入了最新的长期支持，来自 Ubuntu 的 硬件支持栈。

“反馈Feedback” 应用已被改进，现在包含有搜索栏并已迁移到 GTK 4。

“邮件Mail” 应用完全重做，带来了更稳定的用户体验。

已集成 GNOME Web 44.6。

核心应用得到了各种更新。


我建议你阅读官方的 发布说明 ，以更深入地了解此版本。

📥 下载 elementary OS 7.1

由于 elementary OS 是一种 “看着给” 发行版，你可以前往 官方网站 购买或免费下载它。


elementary OS 7.1


你也可以选择他们网站上列出的一些硬件零售商，他们提供预装发行版的笔记本电脑和台式机。

architectures; it has registers and instructions to perform the usual
operations.  But there is a key difference: BPF programs must pass the
kernel's verifier before they can be run.  The verifier imposes a long list
of additional restrictions so that it can prove to itself that any given
program is safe to run; getting past those checks can be a source of
frustration for BPF developers.  At the 2023 GNU Tools Cauldron,

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[10月6日晚间消息，据报道，知情人士今日称，微软将于10月13日（下周五）宣布完成以690亿美元收购动视暴雪交易。这意味着，经过20多个月的努力，微软终于成功收购动视暴雪。


届时，微软能否如愿宣布这一消息，还要取决于英国反垄断监管机构“竞争与市场管理局”（CMA）。CMA今年早些时候阻止了这笔交易，但微软最近又重新提交了收购建议，从而获得了CMA的初步批准。


目前，CMA正在收集公众意见，而今日就是最后期限。因此，预计CMA于下周做出正式的决定。基于当前的形势，除非在最后一刻出现任何意外，否则CMA将批准这笔交易。


去年1月，微软宣布以690亿美元收购动视暴雪。交易完成后，微软将成为世界上营收第三高的游戏公司，仅次于腾讯和索尼。随后，全球多家监管机构对这笔交易展开了调查。


如今，这笔交易已在40个国家获得批准，只待英国的许可。为了等待CMA的审查结果，微软和动视暴雪7月份还同意延长这笔交易的最终期限，从7月18日延长至10月18日。


对于这笔交易，英国CMA主要担心会对未来的云游戏市场竞争产生不利影响。但今年8月，微软向CMA提交了新的收购方案。根据新提议，微软将动视暴雪当前和未来新游戏的云游戏权转让给育碧（Ubisoft）。


而CMA随后表示，将动视暴雪的云游戏版权出售给育碧在很大程度上解决了之前的担忧。


如果微软成功收购动视暴雪，这将成为游戏行业最大的一笔交易，将微软在游戏机主机市场的影响力，与《使命召唤》和《魔兽世界》等动视暴雪的游戏紧密结合在一起。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I find it incumbent upon myself to address a matter of arguable gravity regarding two widely used command-line tools, Wget and Curl. Dear reader: We've been misled, charmed by the allure of the seductive Wget, when in fact, we should have been courting the reliable Curl.
 Consider the the infamous Venn diagram of these two tools, created by the internet sage Daniel Stenberg. His visual explication, which can be found at 'https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/2023/09/04/the-curl-wget-venn-diagram', leads us to an enlightening discovery:
 The only selling point of Wget over curl is its recursive nature of website mirroring.
 But Wget - in my experience - while it purports to be the ideal tool for mirroring, is not as out-of-the-box as it first appears. Indeed I failed for hours to get it working on an allegedly simple website.
 In short: Delve a notch deeper past the documentation, and you'll notice the façade crumble, not living up to the marketed ideal.
 "Skill issue" I hear you say? Perhaps, but make sure I tried it on the latest version, Wget2, to no avail.
 Now let's address the elephant in the room: The ethical patronage of the GNU project and the Free Software Foundation. Surely the paragon of free software, and the architects of the modern world alright, would not be so careless as to endorse a tool that falls tragically short of expectations?
 Well, I'm afraid to say, they have. And this is not devoid of precedent.
 You see, the GNU project has a history of missteps regarding internet facing tools. Take for instance their LibreJS browser extension, which failed to gain traction. Not to mention their JavaScript MVC framework, of which I forgot even the name.
 In conclusion, I urge you to reconsider your choice of tooling. Curl is wurldebar, and Wget is regret.

 Highlights:
  
jackdbus support is now enabled by default. 
 IRQ based scheduling in ALSA was improved and enabled by default for Pro-Audio profile. It will also link the pcms together to get lower latency. This now matches what JACK does and results in equal latency for Pro-Audio profiles. 
 Support both old and new versions of webrtc-audio-processing to make the transition easier. 
 Forced quantum changes by nodes or metadata will now also force a suspend and resume of the graph, like the rate changes to make sure all nodes adapt to the new quantum. This is important for Pro-Audio nodes that…]]></summary>

在针对谷歌的反垄断审判的笔录中披露，苹果公司与 DuckDuckGo 就取代谷歌搜索引擎作为苹果 Safari 浏览器私人模式的默认搜索引擎进行了谈判，但最终拒绝了这一想法。DuckDuckGo CEO 说，苹果已经将 DuckDuckGo 的其他几项隐私技术整合到 Safari 中，“除了搜索”。但苹果认为，由于 DuckDuckGo 依靠必应提供搜索信息，因此也可能向微软提供一些用户信息，这让他相信 DuckDuckGo “关于隐私的营销与细节有些不符”。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[德培老师中秋节前一天走了。李洱说，以后每临中秋，都会想起他。
我看着他最后一本书的书名，《要对夜晚充满激情》，想他真是喜欢夜晚：酒桌上肆言无忌，犀利痛快之余，又以妙语解颐。他喜欢热闹的前半夜，也享受独属于他一个人的后半夜：读书，写作。他常常抱怨为写一篇评论费了多少时间去读一个作家的全部作品，这种牢骚，其实于他也是享受；过一段时间，他写另一篇文章，又会同样抱怨牢骚。他的评论，动辄几万言，如果没有夜晚的孤独激情，难以想象。他前一本评论集叫《黎明时分的拾荒者》，这个书名，其实说的是实际情形，是写实的。

《要对夜晚充满激情》

这两本书都是他重返文学批评之后写的。在他有回归的心思而踌躇拖延的那段时间，他同代的批评家和作家朋友，有不少助推的动作。那时候陈思和老师主编《上海文学》，他让我去和德培老师做个对话，以这种形式让老朋友亮个相、开个头。我拿着录音笔跑到德培老师书店的办公室，他开口说：“快二十年没搞文学批评了，放弃甚至丧失发言权，我都已进入底层了。”对话录音转成文字，未加修饰，以《当代文学的问题在哪里》为题，发表在《上海文学》2006年第五期。
这是件小事，我在其中的作用更不值一提，却让德培老师记住了，从此他认定我是个好人，许多年之后，还在酒酣耳热之际念叨。有一次他又说起，我为转移话题，就“刺”他一下，说：“你退过我的稿。”
他果然急了，追问：“我怎么会退你的稿？”
1988年，我读大三，写了篇《荒谬、困境及无效克服——余华小说试评》，德培老师刚创办的《文学角》没出几期就赢得满堂彩，我的老师李振声拿着我的文章给德培老师，德培老师有点为难：《文学角》设定的栏目固定，再就是几个专栏，没有合适的地方放。坐在对面的吴亮老师说，文章给我吧。吴亮老师那时候在办《上海文论》，这一年的第一期刚发了一篇我谈马原小说的文章，接着就在第三期发了这篇谈余华小说的。
“这么多年了，你还耿耿于怀？”德培老师认真起来，我倒是后悔了。我哪里耿耿于怀，所以说这件往事，不过是凑巧，刚在吃饭前看到吴亮老师的朋友圈，贴出一封余华当年的信，他请吴亮寄一本有这篇评论的杂志给他看看，让我想起了这个。
没过一会儿，德培老师又端着酒杯说：“不高兴了？”
这是他的口头禅，常常问旁边的人，“不高兴了？”
我说，你真是玻璃心。
酒桌上恣肆是一面，生怕伤了别人是另一面。
他常年西装革履白衬衫，陈思和老师说，德培年轻时候穿中山装，第一个扣子也总是扣着。和德培老师一起去过几次外地，见他总是在行李包之外，另提一个硬纸袋，专门装折叠整齐的白衬衫。那年我们同车去北京参加鲁迅文学奖颁奖典礼，我对着他的硬纸袋说：“你太太真是不怕麻烦，每天要给你熨烫白衬衫。”他反驳道：“你看看清楚，我这两件是新买的，还没拆呢。”对于得奖，他心里是高兴的，一辈子做这么一件事，有肯定，也是个安慰。他不掩饰他的高兴，有时候会表述为：“我一个退休工人，他们给了个奖。”——他得奖的那本书，名叫《谁也管不住说话这张嘴》。
又有一次聚会，满满一桌子人，喝得兴奋。不知谁说起《沈从文的后半生》这本书，临时成为话题。德培老师忽然正色，盖过众声：“写《沈从文的后半生》算什么本事？有本事，你写前半生。”
我坐在他对面，回应了他的前半句：“写后半生多少也得有点本事。”
后半句没回应，却在心里佩服他的说法。几年后我出了《沈从文的前半生》，当然不能说是他的刺激，但想起他的话，愈发觉得他是真懂写作之难的人 。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bottles 的发展计划充满激动人心，目标是成为在 Linux 上运行 Windows 应用和游戏的更优秀工具。


如今，Wine 和 Steam 的 Proton 让 Linux 用户获得了升级的游戏体验。

而 Lutris、Heroic Games Launcher 等应用利用这些技术，让你能够轻松管理、安装和启动游戏。

Bottles 是一款此类的实用工具，它帮助你在 Linux 上 运行 Windows 应用和游戏。这是在 Linux 上使用 Epic 游戏商店 的最佳方法之一。

我深信，它在不久的将来会成为一个更令人激动的工具！为什么？ 🤔

嗯，我发现了一些关于 Bottles 下一代升级计划的有趣更新 🤯

Bottles Next：完全变革

当前版本的 Bottles 是一款简洁且可以定制的应用，帮助你仅需点击几次便可管理和运行 Windows 应用和游戏。



根据其未来升级计划（尽管目前还没有具体的时间表），开发者们准备提升用户体验，以及提供一个更强大的后端。与之配合的是，他们还计划重新设计用户界面，以满足初级和资深用户的需求。

现在，我来告诉你更多它的计划信息...

用户界面的重新设计

这是其创建者 Mirko Brombin 分享的 Bottles Next 的一些效果图：



如你所见，他们的目标是推出两种使用模式，即 “Next 模式Next Mode” 针对初级用户，以及 “经典模式Classic Mode” 针对资深用户。


🚧 这些效果图可能不代表 Bottles Next 的最终设计。


Bottles Next 的更新旨在提供更简洁的用户体验，同时依然保持了工具的可定制性。



游戏信息界面看起来很吸引人，显示了重要信息，并提供了进入高级设置的选项。

2018年，威廉玛丽大学现代语言与文学系教授魏美玲（Emily Wilcox）的著作Revolutionary Bodies: Chinese Dance and Socialist Legacy由美国加州大学出版社出版。2023年6月，该书中译本《革命的身体：重新认识现当代中国舞蹈文化》（以下简称《革命的身体》）由复旦大学出版社出版，曾任教于北京舞蹈学院人文学院、翻译过多本舞蹈相关著作的李红梅教授担任译者。《革命的身体》是魏美玲基于对中国舞蹈及其历史的长久接触与兴趣写就的第一部专著，也是第一部以一手资料为基础用英文书写的中国现当代舞蹈史著作。
2002年，魏美玲第一次到中国，其时她作为哈佛大学的一名本科生，随该校国标舞队到中国巡演。2005年至2008年，魏美玲在普林斯顿暑期北京中文培训班和清华大学IUP中文中心学习，并学习了中国舞。2008年至2009年，她又以富布莱特学者身份至北京舞蹈学院访学，期间接受了舞蹈研究及实践方面的训练，并基于自身人类学的学术背景，在中国各地展开了对一百五十多位不同年龄和不同背景的专业舞者的口述史工作。这些舞者的生活经历与切身回忆，使她对中国舞蹈历史产生了浓厚兴趣，也成为她著书立说的内在动机。
2013年，魏美玲在《中国演唱文艺》（Journal of Chinese Oral and Performing Literature）杂志上列出了一份1950年代至2012年英文学界关于中国舞蹈研究的书目，并指出相较于研究其他中国表演形式的英文著作以及研究中国舞蹈的中文著作而言，英文学界尚缺乏相对有深度的中国舞蹈的研究著作。写作《革命的身体》一书，正是魏美玲试图突破已有研究的一次努力。
在该书中，魏美玲探讨了二十世纪至二…]]></summary>

When I attach a device into a USB hub, it can be seen in lsusb — the kernel has registered it;
 The kernel space takes care of low-level communication with devices. The userspace, on the other hand, has to rely on the kernel’s abstractions.
  
So I’m just curious how does Ledger Live (an electron app) communicates with Ledger devices over USB?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[这是一款为 Linux 打造的用户友好的系统监控应用。让我们一起来了解！


假如有一天，你发现你的系统开始运行缓慢，你的发行版的默认的系统监控应用又无法给与帮助，你会如何处理？

我能理解当你在试图找出是什么进程引起你的系统运行缓慢，而系统监控器却无法提供帮助是何等烦恼的事。

在此，我初步介绍的这个工具，或许就是你需要的。这就是 “任务中心Mission Center”，一个为 Linux 打造的系统监控器，旨在提供实用的功能。

下文将一一展示这个应用可以做什么，以及它的一些限制。


🚧 这个应用还是非常新的，处于积极的开发中。所以，预计会有一些变动。


⭐ 任务中心：概述



主要使用 内存安全的 Rust 编程语言 编写的 任务中心 是一款可以让你监控 CPU、内存、磁盘、网络以及 GPU 的系统监控器。

它的几个关键特性包括：


实时监控每个线程的 CPU 使用情况。

有能力监控 RAM 和 Swap 的使用状况。

提供应用和进程的详细使用信息。

监控网络的利用率和传输速度。


👨‍💻 初步印象

我在一个运行着 Ubuntu 22.04 LTS 的系统上进行了测试，由于这款应用 提供了 Flatpak 安装方式，使得整个安装过程相当简洁。

我不得不说，任务中心 看起来和 Windows 11 上的任务管理器大体相似，这并不算是坏事。这种界面布局十分适合以用户友好的方式展示所有重要的信息。

我首先查看的是系统监控的 “性能Performance” 部分中的 CPU 标签。它向我提供了我处理器的所有关键信息，并配有一个能展示实时 CPU 使用率的图表。

我还能切换到 “逻辑处理器logical processors” 视图，以便观察每个线程的 CPU 使用情况。只需在图表上进行右键点击并进入 “改变视图Change Graph To” 菜单即可切换。



我接下来查看的是 “内存Memory” 标签，它提供了一个内存使用的实时图表，以及两个正在使用的 RAM 模块的实用信息。



然后我查看了 “硬盘Disk” 标签。即便我在我的系统中有多个存储硬盘，但我只在 Ubuntu 上使用了 “Disk 4”。我对其进行了使用率检查，显示出来的似乎是实时的磁盘使用数据。

不过，据开发者所述，当前硬盘使用率的百分比仍在开发中，因此，现在的数据可能尚不准确。



最后，我查看了 “以太网Ethernet” 标签。它向你展示了有关系统的网络活动的实时图表，包括了下载和上传活动的两个信息点。

然而，它对于应用的网络数据使用情况，目前还是没有应用级的网络数据信息。这个功能，开发者正 在着手开发。



接下来，我查看了 “应用Apps” 部分。这里包含了系统中运行的大部分（甚至全部）应用和进程。它不有展示了应用/进程的全部有用信息，包括 PID、CPU 使用、内存和磁盘使用情况。

你还能在任何一个应用/进程上进行右键点击，来选择 停止应用/进程 或 强制停止应用/进程。



我还调整了任务中心应用的一些设置，比如：


调整所有实时图表的更新频率

设定合并进程统计数据

记住我在 “应用Apps” 部分所使用的排序顺序。




我注意到一个缺失的数据，关于我的 GPU。任务中心未能检测到我的英伟达 GPU。

这是可以理解的，因为 GPU 的支持目前仍然处于实验阶段，仅支持 AMD 和英伟达的 GPU。

📥 获取任务中心

任务中心可以在 Flathub 商店 或者 GitLab 上获得，如果你更倾向于从源码来构建的话。


任务中心（Flathub）


💬 你会考虑用任务中心来替代你 Linux 系统上的默认系统监控器吗？

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[安卓 14 开源项目发布

谷歌在纽约举行的“谷歌制造”活动上正式发布了安卓 14。与此同时，谷歌还发布了对应的开源项目 AOSP，安卓 14 的源代码已被推送到 AOSP。安卓 14 将于今天开始向 Pixel 设备推出，并在今年晚些时候向更多移动设备推出。安卓 14 带来的一系列升级和更新就不一一赘述了，值得注意的是，此版本支持 OpenJDK 17。


消息来源：Phoronix



老王点评：虽然越来越多的部分被谷歌放在自己的专有部分，但不管怎么说，安卓总是开源的，而且不是“延迟”开源。




Gmail 向电子邮件添加表情符号反应

在 Gmail 中，你现在可以像回复即时消息聊天一样回复电子邮件，在电子邮件上粘贴一个 “😂” 的表情符号，而不是回复。就像信息应用一样，现在你的电子邮件下方会出现一排表情符号反应数，对话线索中的其他人可以点击添加到反应数中。电子邮件本身并不支持表情符号反应，这使得该功能成为 Gmail 的专有功能，其它没有使用 Gmail 客户端的人会收到一封包含你的单个表情符号反应的新邮件。目前，这项新功能不适用于企业或学校账户、邮件列表等情形。


消息来源：Ars Technica



老王点评：在不破坏电子邮件协议兼容性的情况下，增加一些创新是好的，但是似乎可以比每个表情符都发一个电子邮件做的更好。




X.Org 被发现新安全漏洞，可追溯到 1988 年

十年前，一位安全研究人员评论说，X.Org 服务器的安全性 “比看起来还要糟糕”，例如 GLX 代码就是 “8 万行恐怖代码”，整个代码库中发现了数百个漏洞。而到了 2023 年，新的 X.Org 安全漏洞还在不断被发现，今天公开的几个漏洞中，有几个最早可追溯到 1988 年的 X11R2 代码。


消息来源：Phoronix



老王点评：88 年时我还没见过电脑。所以，这一堆代码中到底有多少问题，就像沙虫里面的沙子一样，怎么也淘洗不干净。]]></summary>

欧美的左翼世界史家在讲授通识课时，大多履行一套政治礼仪：忏悔十九世纪的西方中心主义社科前辈们如何以基督教为模本，为高加索、南亚、东亚乃至玛雅、非洲和马来波利尼西亚的文化冠上形形色色的“主义”和“教义”：穆罕默德ism、孔夫子isme、佛陀ismus……而那些受封“科学”身份范畴的当地民众往往不知所云。在战后去殖民浪潮的浇灌下，西方史界这一抹良知逐渐生根发芽，智识赎罪的自我批判工程纷至沓来，言必谈“去西”“去殖”之势从边缘突入中心，“比较史”“交流史”从潮流升为主流。
然而，最易“去”的往往是史料、语言、地理分布的偏畸，而非概念框架和问题意识上的桎梏。前现代文明的邂逅与演进，史料凿凿，但如何重新排列组合、建构叙述，则透出史家个人语境的底色。杰里·H.本特利的《旧世界的相遇》以“改宗”为“主导动机”谱写了一曲“西式去西”宏篇交响乐。循着曲子的节奏，本先生以盘根错节之才、八面玲珑之笔，援引宗教与世俗、涵化与同化、迫害与抵抗等阐释工具，追溯航海探险和殖民扩张之前的“长时段”“长距离”交流，戴着西方宗教史的镣铐跳了一段全球文化史的热舞。
万变不离其“宗”
本特利先生开篇承诺，他要弥纶统摄古代文化群体相遇时的冲突与交流、扬弃与融合、坚持信念与相互改变（原著第5页、译著第3页）。然而综览全书，千万般际遇如顄淡滂流，统统汇入宗教关系这一潭池泽。诚然，本先生秉笔荷担，也谈科技、贸易和瘟疫，但这些无非是基础活动，托举着宗教际遇的上层建筑——商人网络引入了异域宗教；科技促进了宗教的扩张；瘟疫摧毁了当地宗教……本先生也斟酌“制度”，一口气列举了一大串推动大规模改宗的社会经济机制：宗教群体之间的差异化税收、宗教团体之间的金融资源转移、任用政治军事长官时的…]]></summary>

Live 原意多指“现场”、“实时”，在计算机环境中使用时也多引用此意。但对它的翻译就颇费神，因为无论是在 Live Patch，还是更多见的 Live USB/CD、Live Session，其实都不好翻译为“现场”、“实时”。推荐使用“立付”，在照顾发音的同时，取其“立时交付”之意。而对于 Live Stream，提议者建议依旧翻译为“直播”、“实时流”。对于 Live Patch，还是采用 “热补丁” 这样的意译。


如果你喜欢它并选择安装至硬盘上，可以使用同一个立付 USB 来进行。创建立付 USB 是安装 Linux Mint 的第一步。

准备工作

如果需要制作一个 Linux Mint 立付 USB，你需要:


一个 USB 驱动器（可以是 U 盘、移动硬盘等），至少需要 8GB 的空间；

一个可以使用的互联网连接，以便下载 Linux Mint ISO；

一个帮助你制作立付 USB 的写盘工具。

作为一个教名著阅读课程的教师，读美国记者、评论家大卫·丹比（David Denby）的《重读经典的伟大冒险》（原书名Great books: My Adventures With Homer, Rousseau, Woolf, and Other Indestructible Writers of the Western World，1996），那种感觉实在是太有感觉了，而且我相信选修这门课的同学如果读到这本书，也可能会有同感。因为它不是讲如何读那些西方经典名著——那些书太多了，而是以一个三十年前修过这门课程的老学生身份，重新回到哥大的课室听课一年，然后讲述今天（其实是1990年代初了）在这门课程上那些老师如何介绍与评论经典，学生如何在讨论中接受、质疑和反驳，以及在美国的大学教育语境中这门课程背后的政治文化冲突。虽然在我们的语境中，这门课程的教学背景与美国大学有重大区别，但是在全球化与当代性的共同时代景观面前，关于经典阅读课程教学的许多问题其实是有相通之处的。在这一年的课堂听课与讨论的记录中，作者针对教师与学生提出的一些问题在今天对于我们来说仍然是鲜活的。据介绍，该书此前已经有过两个中译本出版，但已绝版十余年，我是读之恨晚。这次理想国推出的是更新译本，订正了此前版本中的错译、漏译问题，刚出来三个月就二刷，似乎也可以说明“重读经典”永远不会过时。
说到为什么要重读经典，似乎没有人比伊塔洛·卡尔维诺的那句话说得更经典了：“经典是那些你经常听人家说‘我正在重读……’，而不是‘我正在读……’的书”（伊塔洛·卡尔维诺《为什么读经典》，黄灿然、李桂蜜译，译林出版社，2006年，第1页）。我也把这句话录入我的课程教材中，意在向选修这门…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There are statements that seems very logicial and sensible, but are they actually true? Like in chess, a move can look very logical seeing 5 moves in the future, but it can easily actually be a blunder seeing more.
 For example, there is a sensible argument: "typing fast won't make you a good programmer, because you spend most the time thinking". This sounds very logical and sensible, but the truth is the faster you get your idea on to the screen, the more time you can spend thinking about what's wrong with it and how to improve it, you will learn more things and become better faster. I can believe someone to be an ok or even good programmer with bad typing-speed, but I am very confident that you will never be great without a fast typing-speed, your time is just too limited.
 The more time past, the very sensible idea of ensuring good security by having the compositor having a final say in everything sounds good, but in the end it just won't allow certain good UX to be done, like the multiple windows app problem. So is the idea of Wayland actually the best? X is bad, its problem is already recognized while people are still developing it. However, I felt like wayland get a pass because there are so much time resources already putting into it, so many code was written and review with certain ideals, that it is just too late for re-thinking.
 In the end, I felt like the best actual thing is a compromise somewhere between X and Wayland, but like for many other things, we human tend to think the opposite of something bad is good and just have to go too far in another direction, and these will become valuable examples for the future generations to learn from, to improve and to propose something better.
 I felt like there eventually be a 3-4 years period where wayland is dominant, but people will be frustrated enough and something else will pop up.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Overall, a group is a convenient way to combine users/other groups as one entity in order to manage them as a single unit (such as with permissions). The goal of a primary group is that the operating system can assign it to files/directories that the user is creating (https://www.baeldung.com/linux/primary-vs-secondary-groups).
 Overall, GID (group identifier) is used in order to uniquely identify the primary group ID that the user belongs to. By the way, we can see it using the “id” (https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/id.1.html) command (it is the data which follows “gid=”), or by using the “-gn” switch — as shown in the screenshot below (https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/410367/how-to-get-the-primary-group-of-a-user).
 Moreover, we can change it using the “usermod” tool (https://linux.die.net/man/8/usermod), it is important to know that for the change to be visible we need to login again — as shown in the screenshot below. We can also see it as the first group in the output of the “groups” (https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/groups.1.html) command — as also shown in the screenshot below. The information about the primary groups is saved as part of “/etc/passwd” (https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man5/passwd.5.html).
 Lastly, a user can be part of only one primary group at a time. In parallel the information about the secondary groups is saved in “/etc/group” (more about that in future writeups).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[今日提交给美国证券交易委员会（SEC）的文件显示，苹果公司CEO蒂姆·库克（Tim Cook）抛售了价值约4100万美元的股票，为两年多以来的最大规模抛售。


SEC文件显示，库克抛售了511000股苹果股票，进账约4100万美元（税后）。经过此次抛售，库克仍持有约328万股苹果股票。


库克的此次股票抛售，也正值其年薪罕见地削减40%，至4900万美元。作为薪酬调整的一部分，今年库克与苹果业绩挂钩的股票奖励，也相应地从之前的50%提高到75%。


相比之下，库克2022年获得了9940万美元的报酬，包括300万美元的基本工资，约8300万美元的股票激励和奖金。


除了库克，苹果的其他高管也披露了股票出售情况，包括高级副总裁Deirdre O’Brien和Katherine Adams，他们各自出售了1130万美元的股票。


库克上一次大规模抛售股票是在2021年8月，当时他在担任CEO十年后，出售了超过7.5亿美元的苹果股票。扣除税金后，净入账约3.55亿美元。


今年7月，苹果股价曾创下历史新高。此后，在更广泛的科技股抛售中，苹果股价也下跌了逾12%。


今日，投行KeyBanc Capital Markets下调了苹果的股票评级，理由是销售增长前景暗淡。今日盘前交易中，苹果股价一度下跌了约1.2%。

My sole purpose is research; I'm looking to understand why people choose one over the other. I won't be challenging or correcting your views; I'm only interested in gathering a range of opinions for a comprehensive study. 
 Hello everyone,
 I'm conducting research on the desktop experiences of Linux and Windows, and I'm keen to compile a list of reasons why people prefer Linux over Windows. Your personal insights would be invaluable for this research.
 I'm not here to debate or correct your points; my goal is to understand your perspective. I'll only respond with counter-questions to dig deeper into your reasoning.
 Whether you've always been a Linux user, considered switching to Windows, or even switched back from Windows to Linux, I want to hear your thoughts.
  
Why do you like Linux?
 Have you considered switching to Windows? If you haven't, why not?
 If you've used Windows in the past, what prompted you to switch to Linux?
 Would you do the Switch if your concerns for the other OS have been addressed?
  
Feel free to answer any or all of these questions, or share any other thoughts you might have on this topic. Your input is greatly appreciated!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[音乐制作人们，这是你们翘首以待的消息。


数字音频工作站（DAW） 已经成为音乐制作专业人士重要工具之一。

遗憾的是，对于 Linux 用户而言，选择十分有限。最受欢迎的选择通常是开源 DAW，如 Ardour、Audacity 和闭源的 Bitwig。

当然，这些工具都有一定的优点。然而像 Cubase、Nuendo 和 Pro Tools 这类在音乐产业内广泛使用的热门 DAW 却没有 Linux 版 🥺

随着 Studio One 的出现，这个局面正在发生变化 🎉

Studio One 是专业音响设备制造商 PreSonus 所推出的一款广受欢迎的 DAW，它自 2009 年推出以来一直受到许多专业人士的青睐，被视为 Steinberg Cubase、 Avid Pro Tools、 Apple GarageBand 等软件的有效替代品。


🚧 需要指出的是，Studio One 并不是 FOSS（自由与开源软件），我们在这里谈论的是其新增的 Linux 支持。


Studio One：登陆 Linux! 🐧



最初作为公开的测试版本发布的是 Studio One 6.5，这是首个为 Linux 用户提供的版本。

官方明确说明了该软件的系统需求为 Ubuntu 23.04，并且需要使用 Wayland 会话。

作为 DAW，它拥有大量高级特性，用于创作、录制和混音。其中一些关键特性包括：


多轨工具

内置节拍制造器

支持 草稿本Scratch pad

为音频和 MIDI 提供和声编辑


无论你有没有 PreSonus 音频设备，这个消息都是兴奋的。

想必这会对其他商业上成功的 DAW 考虑 Linux 成为新的平台产生影响 🤩

这对于 Linux 的桌面应用肯定会有巨大的推动作用，有望提升 当前的市场份额 📈

更重要的是，Studio One 支持在所有三个平台上无缝地创作音乐，这也是它的另一大优势。你可以使用自己最喜欢的 DAW 创作音乐，而不需要被依赖于某个特定的平台。这听起来很不错，对吗？

需要注意的是：PreSonus 当前并未提供任何官方的 Linux 方面的支持。而未来的稳定版本可能会改变这个局面。

尽管如此，公司推荐用户在他们的用户论坛的 Linux 版块 中讨论与 Linux 相关的问题，以获得解答和分享社区反馈。


🚧 请注意，这是一个测试版，还不应该在实际生产中使用。开发者已在 Studio One 的 Linux 支持页面 上列出了一些已知的问题。一些功能，如 CD 刻录、视频支持、DDP 导入/导出等，在 Linux 版本中完全不可用。


尽管 Studio One 是闭源的，但它对 Linux 的支持将使 Linux 平台对音频工程师、制作人乃至艺术家更加友好。

📥 获取 Studio One 测试版

要想体验这个公开的测试版，你首先需要注册一份订阅计划。我建议你首先进行30 天的免费试用，看看它在你的 Linux 系统上的表现如何。

想了解更多，欢迎访问他们的 官方网站。


Studio One


💬 对于这个新闻，你有多兴奋？你试用过了吗？欢迎在下方评论留言分享你的想法！

不论人文学科的学生，还是从事研究的学者，以至其他专业喜爱读书的朋友，我们都喜欢阅读学术大家的传记，以汲取这些大家求学、成长、研究和思考的智慧。笔者从事中西经典的教学工作，阅读香港城市大学出版社出版的这本《张隆溪：独行于经典之间》，感到分外亲切。
在香港城市大学任教多年的张隆溪，选择苏格拉底的学生柏拉图写的《苏格拉底的申辩》作为大学本科新生课程“Great Works in the Humanities”的第一课。苏格拉底作为热爱智慧的哲学家，视自己为牛虻，整天在古希腊城邦四处和人说话，上至国王诗人，下至各行各业的百姓，希望找到其中一位比他聪明的人，以证明太阳神阿波罗说他为世上最聪明的人是错的。可惜的是，每个人都觉得自己很聪明，没有认识到自己无知的地方。张教授指出希腊哲学教人要认识自己，就是要认识自己的无知之处，这和《论语·为政》中孔子所说“知之为知之，不知为不知，是知也”是共通的。张教授希望借这个故事，让学生明白无知才是求知的起点。
张隆溪的学问根底，有家族的因素，也有时代的原因。清代治河名臣张鹏翮是张氏的先祖，康熙皇帝在懋勤殿召见张鹏翮，张题诗云：“懋勤顾问，知遇崇隆，清正仁厚，进德立功。”此后，张氏一族每一辈各以此诗顺序取一字起名。张隆溪生于1947年，与张鹏翮隔了八代，是“隆”字辈。
1960年代是张隆溪的中学时代，他和其他中国少年一样，都喜欢学习外语——俄语，更喜欢学习英语，很快英语水平较其他同学优胜。他回忆道：“看了查良铮先生翻译的俄国诗人普希金的诗，很喜欢，初中就自学俄文。”张隆溪常到成都外文书店买英文书，也买俄文的德语教科书，于是又通过俄文学德语，这奠定了他之后富有世界视野的文学观。

20 世纪 40 年代初，第一台真空管计算机投入使用，解决了人类无法解决的问题。这些庞大的机器复杂、特殊，而且普遍不可靠。在许多方面，今天的量子系统与早期的真空管计算机有着惊人的相似之处，它们也是难以置信的昂贵、特殊和不直观。如果量子系统能够像多年前的巨人计算机破解德国密码那样破解现代加密技术，将颠覆建立在现代计算技术之上的世界。量子系统的早期采用者将会获得最大收益，因此各国和各个公司都为量子成为真正竞争威胁的可能性投入了大量资金。不过，目前量子计算机能做的事情，没有一件是经典计算机做不到的，真正的创新将出现在我们用量子算法解决量子问题的时候。

老王点评：从庞大到一个房间放不下的计算机，到如今的计算无处不在，才短短几十年。那么，从现在的量子计算机变成手持量子计算机，需要多少年，会改变多少事情？




Meta 开始裁员元宇宙芯片部门

Meta 公司计划裁掉其面向元宇宙的 Facebook 敏捷硅团队（FAST）员工，该部门约有 600 名员工。FAST 部门的任务是开发定制芯片，为 Meta 的现实实验室部门生产的增强现实和虚拟现实硬件提供动力。

老王点评：元宇宙梦碎，不知道 Meta 还会改名回 Facebook 吗？结合上一条，或许元宇宙真正接管世界时，会是在量子计算普遍可用的时候。




亚马逊利用秘密算法提高价格，获利 10 亿美元

根据美国联邦贸易委员会（FTC）对亚马逊提起的垄断诉讼中被删节的部分内容，亚马逊使用了一种代号为 “尼斯项目” 的算法来测试它能以竞争对手会跟进的方式提高多少价格。该算法帮助亚马逊提高了各购物类别商品的利润，并影响竞争对手提高了价格。如果竞争对手没有将价格提高到亚马逊的水平，该算法就会自动将商品恢复到正常价位。据一位熟悉此事的人士称，亚马逊通过使用该算法获得了超过 10 亿美元的收入。亚马逊在 2019 年停止使用该算法，但原因不明。

老王点评：“算法是无辜的”，错的是经营商业的人和写算法的人？是吗？]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[一份让你深入体验最新 Linux 内核编译过程的实操指南。


出于各种原因，自行编译 Linux 内核可能引起你的兴趣。这些原因可能包括但不限于：


测试一个比你目前的 Linux 发行版更新的内核版本

采用一组不同的配置选项、驱动来构建内核

学习者的好奇心 😃


此指南将一步步指导你如何亲自编译 Linux 内核，包括你该运行哪些命令，为什么运行这些命令以及这些命令的执行效果。本文篇幅较长，所以请做好准备！


🚧 诸如 Ubuntu 这样的发行版提供了更简单地安装主线 Linux 内核的方式。但本教程目标是从源码手动完成所有工作。此教程需要你付出时间、耐心以及丰富的 Linux 命令行使用经验。本文更注重亲身实践的体验。不管怎么说，我仍建议你在虚拟机或备用系统中尝试此冒险，而非在你的主系统上进行。


前置准备

在软件领域，构建任何事物都有两个基本要求：


源代码

构建依赖


因此，作为预备环节，我们需要下载 Linux 内核的源码压缩包，并安装一些能让我们成功构建 Linux 内核的依赖项。

Linux 版本导览

在任何时刻，Freax Linux 内核都有四种“版本”。

Linux 的这些 “版本”，按照开发流程的顺序是：


linux-next 树： 所有准备合并到 Linux 代码库的代码首先被合并到 linux-next 树。它代表的是 Linux 内核最新也是“最不稳定”的状态。大多数 Linux 内核开发者和测试人员使用这个来提高代码质量，为 Linus Torvalds 的后续提取做准备。请谨慎使用！

发布候选版（RC） / 主线版： Linus 从 linux-next 树抽取代码并创建一个初始发布版本。这个初始发布版本的测试版称为 RC（发布候选Release Candi…]]></summary>

advisory for a vulnerability in the GNU C Library related to the
handling of the GLIBC_TUNABLES environment variable:


	We successfully exploited this vulnerability and obtained full root
	privileges on the default installations of Fedora 37 and 38, Ubuntu
	22.04 and 23.04, Debian 12 and 13; other distributions are probably
	also vulnerable and exploitable (one notable exception is Alpine
	Linux, which uses musl libc, not the glibc).


Updates from distributors are beginning to appear and should be applied on
any systems with untrusted users.
The curious can see the fix applied to glibc in this
patch series.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I don't distro hop so I rarely play at installing a distro. This week I installed the latest Ubuntu on some computer and had a little trouble. I thought I had partitioned the disk correctly but the installation kept failing. I gave up and choose the default option. This default option didn't split the disk into Root and Home nor created a SWAP like I initially wanted. So the experience made me realise that Linux installers should present to the user the partition manager with the default partitioning preselected to allow the user make modifications on non essential partitions he wants, or at least educate the user on how he needs to partition his disk for the installation to succeed. Has the installer worked this way I could had decreased the size of Root to create a separate Home and proceed with the installation without any problems.

Today's GenAI devtools, such as Copilot, are limited: they are great for writing code, but we all know that programming is only 20% coding, and 80% debugging.
So how can GenAI be used for debugging? As opposed to code completion or test automation, production debugging is not about generating text. Debugging is mostly about root-cause analysis. We realized two things:
1) Generative AI is drastically changing the way we work with data, thanks to its ability to not only generate queries, but also run code and analyze unstructured data. This enables building better data-exploration experiences with far more intuitive interfaces.

 SystemD Journal plugin in PLAY mode, tailing all journals available.
 The plugin can operate on journal centralization servers, where all the logs of your entire infrastructure are aggregated, or on individual servers to explore their own logs.
 The plugin indexes (in run-time, while querying) all the fields available in the journals and presents them as filters.
 Filtering SystemD Journal Logs based on field values.
 The histogram can render the number of log entries over time, of any field, and it can also be used to quickly jump to the relevant logs with a simple click.

从视频中我们可以看到，他手中两台手机显示某酒店原价 442 元的轻奢行政大床房价格不同，其中钻石会员 300 元，而更低等级的黄金会员反而只有 283 元。


10月3日晚间消息，去哪儿网旅行就平台“杀熟”一事回应道：系其优惠券此前已被使用过。


以下为去哪儿旅行回应全文：



尊敬的用户您好，针对您反馈的酒店价格差异问题，核实到您的朋友黄金会员账户中有旅“兔”愉快券（每年每个用户可领取并使用一次）；而您钻石会员账户中旅“兔”愉快券已于7月28日的订单中使用，是引发价格差异的主要原因。幸运叠加券减的一元，是黄金会员账户主动参与活动所得，钻石会员未参与。


我们非常重视您的反馈，正在优化优惠券的列表页面，以便让您更清晰地查询了解您已获得和已使用的优惠券。此次给您造成误解，我们深表歉意。

It supports installing and integrating local AppImages, AppImages from Github Releases and HTTP URLs. It also supporting updating AppImages. Most of the commands are inspired from and similar to that of Flatpak. I would love to hear your opinions and feedback on this.
  
Source Code: https://github.com/zyrouge/pho
 Latest Release: https://github.com/zyrouge/pho/releases/latest
  
https://preview.redd.it/c9tvi3a410sb1.png?width=820&format=png&auto=webp&s=a9d7797bb65ead264f98cf05e6287cbbd863df7b
 Why did I do it?
 When I hit the bottom of the barrel (where I cannot find Flatpak version of an application), I had to install either the portable binary or... the AppImage. So, I hit up the internet for AppImage Manager and found only one good candidate (Zap). Zap was good, but it sucked at updating since it always shows you all the latest versions. Also, it's commands where awfully complex with flags like --from and --github. I did contribute to it to fix couple of issues but it seems like the code was very complex. So I took matter into my own hands... damn. By the way, this is my first time making an application with Go. I did this whole project in 3 days working around 20 hours.

几个月前，Linux 内核中的所有微软远程网络驱动程序接口规范（RNDIS）驱动程序都被 禁用，理由是“微软的 RNDIS 协议在设计上是不安全的，……该协议不可能保证安全”。这一禁用 RNDIS 驱动程序的计划遭到了反对，原因是担心可能会破坏 USB 系连Tethering 支持。RNDIS 是建立在 USB 基础上的微软规范，用于在 Windows 上提供虚拟以太网链接，Linux 也支持该规范，但安卓系统已禁用此功能多年。更新的补丁再次尝试禁用微软的 RNDIS 驱动，将让构建内核的人能清楚地知道这些驱动程序已损坏，无法构建。如果没有人提出严重的反对意见，几个开发周期后这些驱动将从内核主线移除。

微软担心人工智能帮助谷歌扩大搜索优势

微软 CEO 萨提亚·纳德拉周一在谷歌反垄断审判中出庭作证时表示，人工智能可以帮助谷歌扩大其在搜索市场的主导地位。纳德拉对法官说，谷歌可以利用其从搜索中获得的巨额利润，向出版商支付内容的独家代理权，使其搜索人工智能优于竞争对手，从而加速其目前的领先地位。美国司法部希望通过纳德拉和微软其他高管的证词来证明，即使是微软这样规模和资源的公司，也无法解除谷歌对搜索市场的控制。

欧洲核子研究中心扩充了超过 1EB 的存储空间

为了准备最新一轮的离子撞击测试，欧洲核子研究中心（CERN）将其用于实验的存储阵列总容量提升到了一百多万 TB（即超过 1EB），其中大部分存储在硬盘上。这个瑞士日内瓦附近的环形粒子对撞机将运行数年，产生超过 600 PB 数据，这些数据必须经过处理后才能长期存储在磁带上。与 2010 年最初的 18 PB 存储系统相比，它已经增长了 56 倍，从 2020 年到今天，该系统的容量已经翻了一番多。该系统运行在 CERN 开发的开源平台 EOS 上。此外，CERN 不仅仅提升了存储容量，其联合数据存储的读取速度首次突破了 1TB/s 的门槛。


消息来源：The Register



老王点评：现在基础设施进步真快，CERN 这种科研单位可以放心的存储数据了。而基础设施的进步，带来的是各个方面的技术进步。]]></summary>

诗词唱和：理解中国诗歌史的一把钥匙
孔子说：“诗可以兴，可以观，可以群，可以怨，迩之事父，远之事君，多识于鸟兽草木之名。”诗如何“群”？正如“诗无达诂”，也可言人人殊。窃以为，“诗”首先是“群”的产物，且不说多有集体创作，即便如所谓的“桑间濮下之曲”，以迄后世的山歌对唱，亦不可目为非个人抒怀言志之作，而是“群”相唱和。至于“不学诗，无以言”的行人辞令，更是“群”相唱和的独特表现。“不学诗，无以言”更进一步，则是宗经征圣，祖述摹仿，代有不绝，也可以视为“群”相唱和的异代回响。
当然，诗歌的发展，绝不会止于宗经征圣，有时宗经征圣，不过是“托古改制”，以复古为革新；而大凡新生事物，总是相对弱小或脆弱，“抱团取暖”式的结社唱和，便应运而生。当然也有反其道而行之的高调宣示性唱和。致敬前贤的唱和，也是推动诗歌发展的一种重要方式。比如李白宣示的“自从建安来，绮丽不足珍”；杜甫的“别裁伪体亲风雅，转益多师是吾师”。最典型最有代表性的，莫过于历代的和陶诗，以及藉东坡生日等举行的雅集唱和。

文人结社和雅集唱和与诗歌发展的关系，至宋元蔚为典型，个中因由及其影响，欧阳光教授的《宋元诗社研究丛稿》首先作了集中揭示。而元末明初的文人结集唱和，其于地域文学流派与诗歌创作发展，则有更新的启示；根据蒋寅先生的考察和论述，以乡先辈为榜样的区域文学传统，也就在明初才正式登上文学舞台（参见蒋寅《清代诗学与地域文学传统的建构》，《中国社会科学》2003年第5期）。这在岭南地区，尤为典型；南园结社唱和，几乎成为岭南诗歌发展的一条主脉。
因此，纵观横览，唱和在某种程度上成为理解中国诗歌及其传统的一把钥匙，而尤以明清为盛。那么，远者“音容渐渺”，明清亦不清晰，但正是可以发力爬梳理，有以清晰呈现的可能。特别是近来笔者在治生活史的过…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[这篇文章是《Btrfs 详解》系列文章中的一篇。从 Fedora Linux 33 开始，Btrfs 就是 Fedora Workstation 和 Fedora Silverblue 的默认文件系统。

以防你忘记，这是系列文章中的前一篇：Btrfs 详解：基础概念。

简介

子卷Subvolume 允许将一个 Btrfs 文件系统划分成多个独立的子文件系统。这意味着你可以从 Btrfs 文件系统挂载子卷，就好像它们是独立的文件系统。除此之外，例如，你还可以通过 限额组qgroup（我们将在本系列的另一篇文章里介绍）定义子卷能够占据的最大空间，或者用子卷去包含或排除快照中的文件（我们会后面的文章中会讲到）。自 Fedora Linux 33 后每个 Fedora Workstation 和 Fedora Silverblue 默认安装过程中会利用子卷。在这篇文章中我们会介绍它是如何工作的。

下面你会找到很多关于子卷的例子。如果你想跟着操作，你必须拥有访问某些 Btrfs 文件系统的权限和 root 权限。你可以通过下面命令来验证你的 /home/ 目录是否是 Btrfs 。

$ findmnt -no FSTYPE /home
btrfs


这个命令会输出你 /home/ 目录的文件系统名。如果它是 btrfs，那就可以了。让我们创建一个新的目录去做实验：

$ mkdir ~/btrfs-subvolume-test
$ cd ~/btrfs-subvolume-test


在下面的文本中，你会看到很多像上面显示的那样的命令输出框。请在阅读/比较命令输出时请记住，框中的内容在行末会被换行。这使得识别跨多行的长行变得困难，降低了可读性。如果有疑问，试着调整浏览器窗口的大小，看看文本的变化!

创建和使用子卷

我们可以通过以下命令创建…]]></summary>

 Seems like a great release, but it's not very clear in the docs whether it's still based on ubuntu 22.04. But considering the docs say it's to support newer hardware, I'm assuming it's just a newer kernel for 22.04, similar to how pop OS creates it's distro.
 Very strange imo, because last week we also got LMDE 6 which came with kernel 6.1, and actually newer packages (relatively).

kernel code that is executing long-running instructions led to a deeper
reexamination of how the kernel handles preemption.  There are a number of
supported preemption modes, varying from "none" (kernel code is never
preemptible) to realtime (where the kernel is almost always preemptible).
Making better use of the kernel's preemption machinery looked like a
possible solution to the immediate problem, but it seems that there are
better options in store.  In short, kernel developers would like to give
the scheduler complete control over CPU-scheduling decisions.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Firefox 正在不断取得进展，让我们一起看看最新的变化吧！


Mozilla Firefox 是一款极棒的开源多平台浏览器，一直以来都以提供最佳的隐私保护功能而广受好评。

更值得一提的是，它成为了大多数 Linux 发行版的默认浏览器，使得它成为了 Linux 用户的自然之选。

Firefox 当前的状况

尽管 Firefox 一直以隐私优先的策略，并且是 谷歌 Chrome 的最佳开源替代品 之一，它仍然被大众所冷落。

这听起来令人失望，不是吗？

的确是的，就以市场份额来说，谷歌 Chrome 占据了 63.56%，而 Firefox 用户仅占据了 2.94% —— 这是来自 StatCounter 的统计数据。



为什么会这样？

详细来说，你可以回顾一下 Firefox 在 2021 年几乎损失了 5000 万用户。

简而言之：Mozilla Firefox 已经尽其所能，但似乎仍然不足以吸引公众的注意。

Firefox 的用户体验在不断改善

幸运的是，在过去的两年中，Mozilla Firefox 似乎专注于一步步提升用户体验，并比平常更多地向公众展示自己。

例如，他们正在为 Firefox 117 提供 自动翻译功能支持。

总的来说，最近的更新已经简化了用户界面，并为 我为什么总是会回到 Firefox 提供了更多理由。

当然，Firefox 已经提供了 Firefox Relay（保护你电子邮箱的工具 之一）等隐私特性。但是，并非每个用户都在乎那些改善了安全性的底层优化。

许多用户希望能够通过网页浏览器无缝的使用他们喜爱的网络服务。这无疑是用户体验的核心部分。

Mozilla Firefox 就是一款能提供这一体验的强大且安全的浏览器。

如果浏览器能满足网民使用他们最喜欢或是主流服务的体验需求，那么 Firefox 就能保留旗下用户，甚至吸引更多新用户。

谷歌的网络服务在 Firefox 上运行得比以前更好了

好消息是：Mozilla 正在全力以赴做出改变！

在最近的 博客文章 中，他们宣布，谷歌 Meet 以及其他谷歌服务如 Workspace、Voice、YouTube、Keep、地图、翻译以及相册 在 Firefox 上运行得比以往任何时候都要好。



他们为此与谷歌的 Workspace 团队一直保持着紧密的合作，他们这样写道：


如果你正在考虑切换，但担心兼容性问题，你可以放心 —— 谷歌的服务在 Firefox 上工作得相当出色，我们也在不断的努力满足你的日新月异的需求。


他们还分享了谷歌 Meet 在 Firefox 上改善后的一些使用体验截图。现在，只需使用 Firefox 115 和更高版本，你就可以在加入视频通话前后应用视效（或背景）。



许多网络用户都一直在使用谷歌的服务，如果他们在 Firefox 上的用户体验也很棒，那么 Firefox 就可能成为一个适合他们替代 Chrome 的选择。

所以，谷歌的网络服务在 Firefox 上的体验得到了改进？

这又是一个使用 Firefox 的理由。

我认为，Mozilla 为了与谷歌 Chrome 及其他竞方保持竞争力，并增强用户对流行网络服务的网络体验，这么做是明智之举。

💬 你现在正在使用 Firefox 吗？在读了这篇文章后，你决定再试一次吗？在下方留言分享你的想法吧！

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[谷歌高管曾称其搜索广告利润“堪比非法企业”

在对谷歌搜索反垄断审判中披露的一份文件显示，谷歌财务副总裁 Michael Roszak 在 “为一门关于沟通的课程” 的会议记录中写道，谷歌的搜索广告 “是有史以来世界上最伟大的商业模式之一”，其经济效益只有某些销售 “香烟或毒品” 的 “非法企业” 才能与之匹敌。此外，这份会议记录中还写道，由于用户迷上了谷歌的搜索引擎，谷歌能够 “在很大程度上忽略需求方” 的 “基本经济规律”，“只关注广告商、广告形式和销售等供应方”。Roszak 否认该会议记录反映出他的真实想法，“因为这与商业目的无关”。他称，该课程要求他把 “我不相信的东西作为演讲的一部分” 告诉学生。谷歌多次反对公开该笔记，而在公开后，谷歌又试图封锁 Roszak 就该文件的证词。

数以百万计的 “数字游民” 正在周游世界

据为公司与自由职业人才牵线搭桥的 MBO Partners 公司称，“近 1700 万美国员工自称是‘数字游民’，比大流行病前的数字翻了一番还多”。在大流行病期间突然转向远程工作，让许多人长期以来的空想变成了可能。在多年的限制之后，被压抑的国际旅行需求激增，工作休闲旅行时间延长的趋势也随之加快。数十个国家正在向这些专业人士推销一种新的签证类别。在亚洲旅行的“数字游民”中，大约有 15% 的人严格遵守美国的工作时间，熬夜工作；另外大约三分之一的人工作时间比较灵活，可以在晚上或清晨工作。

而另外一则 报道 称，旧金山的一些空置办公室准备转变为住房，这些写字楼达到了 33.9% 的历史空置率，空置面积超过 3000 万平方英尺。

研究人员让人工智能帮助反证 P=NP 问题

一个来自国内的研究团队发表了一篇预印本论文，介绍了他们利用 OpenAI 的 GPT-4 来帮助反证 P=NP 问题不成立。该团队的方法相当于从之前的论文中提取论点，然后灌输给 GPT-4，以促使其做出有用的反应。他们通过 97 轮提示，让 GPT-4 扮演“一位睿智的哲学家”、“一位精通概率论的数学家”，诱导 GPT-4 证明 P 事实上不等于 NP。他们观察到，GPT-4 演示了一些论据，从而得出 P 事实上不等于 NP 的结论。他们认为，这项工作表明大型语言模型不仅能吐回大量文本，还能 “发现新的见解”，从而带来 “科学发现”，他们将这一前景命名为 “科学的 LLM”。

老王点评：虽然我觉得人工智能可能能够发现人类所忽视的知识，但是能从这些地方找到证明 P=NP 问题的思路已经超过了我的想象。]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[对于热爱动手实践的你来说，树莓派 5 已经落地，为你绚烂的想法提供热情的舞台！


单板计算机（SBC）领域因树莓派新产品的推出再次活跃起来。

这款被称为 树莓派 5 的新产品，是其非常受欢迎的前身树莓派 4（于 2019 年推出）的进化版。

下面，我们来探讨它的新鲜亮点，以及何时何地可以将其买到手。

🆕 树莓派 5 的新变化是什么？




树莓派 5 是一款足以称得上强大的后继产品，其全新设计的平台搭载了在英国开发的自行设计的芯片。

与树莓派 4 比较，树莓派 5 的性能提升了一倍以上 ，这主要得益于硬件和软件的改进。他们还补充说：


与树莓派 4 相较，我们的 CPU 和 GPU 性能提高了两到三倍，在内存和 I/O 带宽方面也有大约两倍的增长；而且这是我们首次在旗舰树莓派设备上使用了自家的树莓派芯片。


尽管外形并无明显改变，树莓派 5 仍然保留了信用卡大小的尺寸。变化主要体现在端口的位置上。

为了配合这款 SBC 的发布，树莓派团队积极开发了适合的新版本树莓派操作系统。它基于 Debian 12 “Bookworm” 版本，所以你可以期待有很多改进。

这个更新的操作系统预计将在 2023 年 10 月中旬 发布，将过渡到 Wayfire Wayland 合成器系统，摒弃了 X11。

📝 树莓派 5 的关键参数



那么，你可能对树莓派 5 的硬件配置感到好奇。

首先，树莓派 5 是由 Broadcom 的一款新型 16 纳米应用处理器 BCM2712 驱动的。

它使用了一颗 四核 64 位 Arm Cortex-A76 处理器，在标准运行状态下的频率为 2.4 GHz，拥有 每核 512 KB 的 L2 缓存 和一个 2 MB 的共享 L3 缓存。

这一切都融入了一款新的 GPU 中，那就是 Broadcom 的 VideoCore VII。它配备了完全开源的 Mesa 驱动程序。

还有新的 RP1 I/O 控制器，它负责操作各种 I/O 端口，如 USB 2.0/3.0 、千兆以太网、MIPI 收发器 和 常见的 GPIO 端口。


项目 RP1 自 2016 年启动以来，已经投资了 1500 万美元。 🤯


最后，我们看到了新的 DA9091 电源管理 IC，出自 Renesas，它负责处理主板上的电源分配，带有 8 个单独的开关模式电源供应器，以生成树莓派 5 所需的不同电压。

此外，以下是其他一些值得一提的要点：


独立电源按钮

双频 802.11ac Wi-Fi

可选 4 GB / 8 GB 内存版本

2x 4Kp60 HDMI 显示输出

2x 4-通道 MIPI 摄像头 / 显示器收发器

蓝牙 5.0 / 低功耗蓝牙（BLE）


树莓派 5 看上去是一款能助你创建出比当前的 树莓派项目 更棒的新项目的设备。

树莓派 5 配件 🦾



一如既往，树莓派 5 与各种官方配件一同发布。

以带有集成风扇的外壳为例，设计精良，适用于低噪声和长期使用。

还有一种叫做 主动冷却器 的冷却配件，它配有一个铝质热散片和可以安装在主板上的风扇。

由于峰值功率需求的增加，他们也提供了一款 27 W 的 USB-C 电源适配器，以便动手玩家们可以最大限度地使用他们的树莓派 5。

我在这里没有提到的还有一些额外的 树莓派配件，如显示线缆、m.2 连接帽等等。我相信在不久的将来会看到更多的配件。

我强烈建议你浏览官方的 公告博客 ，进一步了解这款有趣的单板计算机的详细信息。

💰 价格和供应信息

树莓派 5 提供两款版本 ，价格从4 GB 版本的 60 美元 开始，8 GB 版本为 80 美元。

目前已经在一些 认证的经销商 开始接受预订，预计将在十月末出货。


树莓派 5（认证的经销商）


他们被限制只能销售给个人购买者，这个限制将持续到今年（2023 年）结束，以避免任何供应链方面的问题。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[尝试添加一个 PPA，却在 Ubuntu 中收到 “无法添加 PPA： 此 PPA 不支持 xyz” 的错误？下面是解决这一错误的方法。


这是一个场景。你正在尝试使用 PPA 在 Ubuntu 中安装软件。

你使用 sudo add-apt-repository 添加 PPA 仓库，当它更新包缓存时，会出现错误：


Cannot add PPA: "This PPA does not support xyz


其中 “xyz” 是 你正在使用的 Ubuntu 版本的代号。

📋 这就是发生这种情况的原因以及你可以采取的措施：


PPA 不适用于你正在使用的 Ubuntu 版本

你应该寻找其他来源来安装该应用

如果绝望了，你可以从 PPA 网页下载 .deb 文件


我将详细讨论以上所有内容。

检查 PPA 是否适用于你的 Ubuntu 版本

首先，在终端中使用以下命令获取 Ubuntu 版本和代号的详细信息：

lsb_release -a


输出将包含详细信息：



现在，访问托管所有 PPA 的 Ubuntu 的 Launchpad 网站：


进入 Launchpad PPA


在这里，查找困扰你的 PPA。为此，你必须使用 PPA 维护者的名字。

例如，如果 ppa:jstaf/onedriver 造成问题，请搜索维护者 jstaf。



一名维护者可能拥有多个软件仓库。单击你要安装的那个。

在里，你应该在 “发布于Published in” 旁边的下拉按钮选择 “所有系列Any Series”。



检查你是否看到你正在使用的 Ubuntu 版本的代号。如果不存在，那么此 PPA 不适用于你的 Ubuntu 版本。

《探究（二）》，[日]柄谷行人著，王钦译，西北大学出版社，2023年10月出版，360页，88.00元

柄谷行人对于“专名”问题的最为详细讨论，出现在1989年出版的《探究（二）》一书中；也可以说，《探究（一）》中作为关键概念和问题意识出现的“他者”，在《探究（二）》中通过与“专名”问题相联系而得到了进一步的阐述和发挥。因此，简要地考察一下柄谷对于“专名”问题的论述，我们可以更好地揭示在柄谷思想中贯穿始终的“外部”“意识”等议题，如何在他经历了思想“转回”而撰写的《探究》中得到发展，并进而与其后以“跨越性批判”为题出版的“探究（三）”的工作形成紧密的关联。
在1991年的一篇题为“个体的地位”的文章中，柄谷就“专名”作为哲学和语言学问题写道：“如索绪尔以后的语言学家所说，语言（langue）和指涉对象或意义无关，它是差异性的能指的关系体系。然而，由于专名是固定指涉，它就偏离了这种关系体系。因此，语言学家在考察语言的时候就排除了专名，认为专名正是将语言和指涉对象结合在一起的谬论的源泉。这是一种与认为可以将专名还原为确定谓述的思考相平行的论述。”（柄谷行人『ヒューモアとしての唯物論』，講談社学術文庫，1999年，23页）在这篇文章里，柄谷没有继续阐明这两种“平行论述”之间的关系，但他所提示的这条由瑞士语言学家索绪尔所开启的语言学“内在研究”的进路，却和他“前期”的思考紧密相关——在这个意义上，提出这种“平行论述”却对之存而不论，或许是一个关键提示：柄谷在讨论“专名”的时候，已经放弃了他此前的论述和思考方式。或者，反过来说，如果仍然陷于此前的思考框架，那么“专名”问题的思想启示就无法得到阐明，故而必须进行思想上的“转向”。此话怎讲？
让我们先简略地回顾一下索绪尔在《普通语言…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[正如风沙湮没的楼兰古国，或盛极一时的吴哥王朝，玛雅文明的前置限定语通常是“神秘消失”——这个绵延三千年，在天文、历法及建筑、雕刻等方面成就卓著的热带雨林文明，在十六世纪西班牙殖民者入侵后遭受毁灭性打击，不仅楼台宫墙荡然无存，连经书、文字也湮没无闻。长期以来，西方学界对玛雅文明盛衰的原因做出了种种推论——其中最离谱的是殷商遗民和外星人说——为正本清源，美国宾夕法尼亚大学人类学教授罗伯特·J.沙雷尔（Robert J. Sharer）和新墨西哥大学助理教授洛·P.特拉克勒斯（Loa P. Traxler）在《玛雅史：失落的世界第五大文明》一书中，以翔实的史料论证玛雅文明的轨迹大致遵循“崛起-没落-复兴-衰亡”这一寻常套路，周而复始，但始终跳不出所谓“历史周期律”。

《玛雅史：失落的世界第五大文明》，[美]罗伯特·J.沙雷尔 / [美]洛·P.特拉克斯勒著，杨靖 等译，浙江文艺出版社，2023年7月版，1048页，238.00元

事实上，早在十六世纪玛雅文明彻底消失之前，它已然经历过史上最严重的一次“没落”——公元九世纪，它突然从古典期的黄金时代跌落谷底：大批城市被废弃，艺术珍品被毁损，人口大量减少，玛雅人似乎重回远古蛮荒时代。本书作者假设，倘若哥伦布没有发现新大陆，玛雅人极有可能继续在他们的怪圈中裹足不前，因为他们的文化基因中缺乏创新动力。正如沙雷尔教授在他的另一部巨著《玛雅文明的日常生活》（Daily Life in Maya Civilization）中所言，与世界其他四大文明相比，玛雅的盛衰毫无独特之处，更无神秘可言——它唯一的教训是，倘若我们也固步自封，“那么玛雅的昨天就是我们的明天”。
一、“外因说”
玛雅号称帝国，但历史上它从未能建立起大一统的帝国，相反，相继而起的王国更类似于希腊半岛的城邦。在历史的长河中，伟大的玛雅城市（王国）如纳克贝（Nakbe）、埃尔米拉…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I finally took the time to figure out and document how to properly shut down the Nvidia GPU on my Razer Blade Pro. The results were so good that I think it is worth sharing. The more polished distros (Ubuntu, PopOs or whatever) may handle this better out of the box?
 In short, my 17-inch laptop now runs cool at 12.5 - 13 Watts at idle. With display on, full backlight, running Wayfire (Wayland compositor) and a couple of terminals. When DPMS kicks in, power consumption drops to 7-7.5 watts. As an added bonus, the Nvidia HDMI sound card thingy is gone. 
 YMMV, of course. A running browser with multiple active tabs may cause the CPU to not enter the lower power states, for instance.
 If you want to check my notes, see link#Power_Management). 
 Feel free to follow up here with gotchas, corner-cases or stuff which no longer works (reliably) as a result of this. Or what you did to *actually* make it work for you. :-)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[工业和信息化部近日印发《工业和信息化部关于开展移动互联网应用程序备案工作的通知》（以下简称《通知》），组织开展移动互联网应用程序（简称App）备案工作，要求在中华人民共和国境内从事互联网信息服务的App主办者，应当依照《中华人民共和国反电信网络诈骗法》《互联网信息服务管理办法》等规定履行备案手续，未履行备案手续的，不得从事App互联网信息服务。


根据工作安排，2023年9月至2024年3月底，《通知》发布前开展业务的App向其住所所在地省级通信管理局履行备案手续。2024年4月至2024年6月底，电信主管部门将组织对App备案情况开展监督检查，对仍未履行备案手续的App依法进行处置。


苹果应用商店APP备案，对大部分国内iPhone用户来说具有极为深远的意义，他们即将无法使用绝大多数来自国外的APP应用，因为国内APP实现了“白名单”机制，所有国外的APP和游戏都将无法使用。由于手机已经逐步替代了电脑，成为最主要的上网手段，那么国内大多数手机用户的信息获取能力将被大幅控制，将会控制在信息茧房之中。


不过，对于苹果APP应用商店的备案，对我来说无任何影响，因为我主要用的就是美国应用商店，美国应用商店不需要备案，可以自由使用任何APP应用。


当然，对于必需获取全面信息的人来说，很可能将会放弃国内应用商店，转而注册和使用国外的应用商店。]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[GNU 庆祝成立 40 周年，RMS 患癌

本周三，自由软件基金会发布公告，将于 10 月 1 日庆祝 “GNU 操作系统诞生 40 周年暨自由软件运动启动 40 周年”，称其为 “计算机历史上的一个转折点”。1983 年 9 月 27 日，一位名叫 理查德·斯托尔曼Richard Stallman（RMS）的计算机科学家宣布，计划开发一种类似 Unix 的自由软件操作系统，名为 GNU，意为 “GNU's not Unix”。GNU 是唯一一个专门为用户自由而开发的操作系统。在当天召开的 GNU 黑客会议上，RMS 一改以往的浓密的头发和胡子的形象出席，并发表了演讲。他还顺便 透露，他已经患癌，并已在接受化疗（因而没有了头发）。不过，庆幸的是，他表示，病情是可以控制的，他仍能活很多年。


消息来源：FSF



老王点评：伟大的 GNU，伟大的 RMS，祝愿 RMS 早日康复！




微软解释在云中提供 Python in Excel 的原因

之前，我们 报道 过，微软发布了 Python in Excel 的公开预览版，无需任何设置就可以在同一工作簿中结合 Python 和 Excel 分析。有用户表示，表示希望能够在其他环境中运行 Python，而不是被锁定的、价格待定的 Azure 云容器。微软解释了这样做的原因：1、在本地机器上安全运行 Python 是一个难题。我们将工作簿中的所有 Python 代码都视为不可信任的，因此我们在 Azure 上的一个与管理程序隔离的容器中执行这些代码；2、我们希望确保您共享的工作簿中的 Python 代码在您的同事打开它时表现相同，而不需要他们安装和管理 Python。3、通过在 Azure 上运行，用户或其系统管理员无需在其组织中使用该功能的每台机器上维护 Python 的本地安装。


消息来源：Reddit



老王点评：似乎有道理，但是在本地有一个沙盒化的 Python 环境有多难？




Canonical 的 Snap 商店暂停上传

一些 Snap 用户报告了最近发布的几个可能是恶意的 Snap 软件包。接到这些报告后，Snap 商店团队立即下架了这些软件包。此外，该团队还对所有新的 Snap 注册提出了临时人工审核要求。这不是 Snap 商店第一次遇到恶意软件包，之前就有带有未披露的隐藏的加密挖掘功能的软件包被上传。


消息来源：Snap Craft



老王点评：似乎这种审核机制不够啊，原来是事后审核吗？]]></summary>

为了纪念 GNU 项目成立 40 周年，自由软件基金会（FSF）已计划在 10 月 1 日（即GNU 40）为家庭、学生以及美国的其他人群组织一场黑客马拉松活动。

活动之前，GNU 项目于 9 月 27 日迎来了 40 岁生日，Richard Stallman 和一些社区成员在瑞士比尔Biel举行了 GNU 黑客会议GNU Hacker's Meeting。

在会议上，他分享了自己的见解，并公开了自己正在与癌症作战的事实。

在主题演讲中，我们看到 Richard Stallman 已经没有他标志性的长胡子和长发，外貌发生了变化。他正在接受化疗以对抗癌症，这就能解释这一切。



他对自己的健康状况并没有多做说明，只是说病情是可以控制的，他仍能活很多年。

他特别强调：


因此，这一点基本上改变了我的生活方式……我仍在为自由软件基金会和其他的事业持续工作。


Richard Matthew Stallman（RMS）：愿你早日康复！

Richard Stallman 是一位计算机科学家，他在 1983 年 9 月 27 日公布了名为 GNU（GNU's Not Unix）的类 Unix 操作系统。

因此，如果没有它，Linux 就无从谈起。这也是为何有些人更倾向于用 GNU/Linux 来称呼 Linux 的原因。

值得一提的是，他还创立了 自由软件运动Free Software Movement，这是如今开源实践的基石。

当然，他在许多事情上都表达了富有争议性的观点，但他在 Linux 和开源上的影响是巨大的！

毫无疑问，得知 Richard 患癌的消息令人难过。然而，尽管面临这样的困境，他以 70 岁的高龄仍然兴致勃勃地出现在了主题演讲中，并发表了演讲。

让我们祝愿 Richard 早日恢复！💐

复旦大学历史学系张仲民教授最近出版了新书《弄假成真：近代上海医药广告造假现象透视》，以晚清上海报刊上的医药广告造假现象为研究中心，重点围绕近代的两个著名假补药燕窝糖精和艾罗补脑汁展开，讨论报刊医药广告的制作过程、叙述结构和修辞特色，医药广告的读者及消费者反应，名人代言的医药广告情况，医药广告中的借名造假现象等，并在近代中国的身体文化与消费文化打造的视角下检讨医药广告对近代中国社会造成的深刻影响。他在接受《上海书评》记者的采访中指出：“消费或不消费的理由与‘爱国’‘强种’等宏大政治关怀的紧密结合，很容易被别有用心者操纵与利用，很容易导致民粹与褊狭，无形中让民族主义叙述商业化、形式主义化、虚伪化，最后非但不能促进民族主义事业的发展，倒往往戏谑化或消解了民族主义论述及其实践的意义。”

《弄假成真：近代上海医药广告造假现象透视》，张仲民著，复旦大学出版社2022年11月出版，342页，88.00元

您在书中提到，彼时欧美各国的医药广告，也是铺天盖地，为什么医药广告这么多？从近代至今，国内外都是如此？
张仲民：这个问题不太好回答。我想这种情况可能跟长期人们的身体需要和医疗现状有关系——人们总希望自己身体健康，不断获得补养，或者生病之后能够迅速得到医疗和恢复健康。然而现实情况却是，哪怕当下医术和科技再发达，总有一些疾病和健康问题是无法治疗、无法避免的，也没有办法靠进补或事后疗养解决。现在如此，可以想见一百多年前人们的困境与心理——不论是中国人或是外国人，均是如此。这可能也是历来人们希望存在有神医妙手回春或万应灵丹起死回生的社会心理基础。在前现代，人们求医问药不成，更常见的方式就是烧香拜佛或求助于神秘力量。不过随着近代世界的科技进步，越来越多的人将保持身体健康的希望寄托于医疗与制药技术的提高。另外一方面，近代以来传媒（主要是报刊等纸媒）的日渐发达，大大拉近了人们…]]></summary>

describing a number of flaws in the Exim mail server, some of which are
exploitable remotely.  These problems, allegedly, were first reported to
the project in June 2022, well over one year ago.  There is some
disagreement over the timing of events, with Exim developer Heiko
Schlittermann claiming
that no actual information was received until last May, and an anonymous
ZDI representative disputing
that story.

Either way, the vulnerabilities are now disclosed, but patches are not yet
on offer; Schlittermann said that "Fixes are available in a protected
repository and are ready to be applied by the distribution
maintainers", so hopefully that situation will change soon.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[日前，苹果App Store迎来重大调整，即日起中国大陆上架的App必须具备有效的互联网信息服务提供者（ICP）备案号。新App现在需要填写备案号才能提审，这就要求开发者应用需有备案号，另外，如果海外App不申请备案号，则无法在中国大陆上架。


苹果App Store部分App上架要求还包括：游戏App必须取得网络游戏出版物号；图书和报刊杂志App必须持有中国国家新闻出版署（NPPA）颁发的《网络出版服务许可证》；新闻App必须持有中国国家互联网信息办公室（CAC）颁发的《互联网新闻信息服务许可证》。


据了解，今年8月，工业和信息化部印发《工业和信息化部关于开展移动互联网应用程序备案工作的通知》（以下简称《通知》）。


其中提到，组织开展移动互联网应用程序（简称App）备案工作，要求在中华人民共和国境内从事互联网信息服务的App主办者，应当依照《中华人民共和国反电信网络诈骗法》《互联网信息服务管理办法》等规定履行备案手续。


未履行备案手续的，不得从事App互联网信息服务。


根据工作安排，2023年9月至2024年3月底，《通知》发布前开展业务的App向其住所所在地省级通信管理局履行备案手续。


2024年4月至2024年6月底，电信主管部门将组织对App备案情况开展监督检查，对仍未履行备案手续的App依法进行处置。


有网友反馈，称已在App Store上架的App目前不填备案号也能正常提审，不过如果明年4月还没备案号的话，App可能会被下架。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[起亚和现代将汽车被盗归咎于 TikTok 和 Instagram

之前，我们 报道 过，起亚和现代汽车由于缺乏基本的 防盗技术，并在社交媒体上病毒式传播的盗窃视频的推动下，导致大量该品牌的汽车被盗。在一起集体诉讼案中，起亚和现代汽车表示，他们的汽车被盗并不是他们的错，因为几乎所有其他汽车也都采用这些技术。相反，这两家公司将矛头指向了社交媒体公司，如 TikTok 和 Instagram，在这些社交媒体上，如何偷车的说明被广泛分享，窃贼们也在炫耀他们偷来的汽车。

老王点评：那么，为什么其它汽车没有大量被盗呢？




美国国家安全局正在启动人工智能安全中心

美国国家安全局（NSA）认为这是一项至关重要的任务，因为人工智能能力正被越来越多地获取、开发并整合到美国的国防和情报系统中。该中心将并入 NSA 的网络安全合作中心。美国情报和国防机构已经在使用人工智能。NSA 表示，这既是为了人工智能安全，也是为了在其国家安全系统和国防工业基地内促进人工智能的安全发展和采用。

老王点评：其实美国只是树立一个假想敌而已。




人工智能初创公司发布无护栏聊天机器人

估值 2.6 亿美元的法国人工智能初创公司 Mistral 在推特上发布了一个磁力链，指向他们首个公开发布的开源 LLM。根据研究人员的测试，对该聊天机器人讨论的内容“没有任何审核机制”。与之对比的是，OpenAI 等人工智能领域的领军企业推出每一项开发成果，都会不断增加一整套保障措施，防止用户让人工智能模型为所欲为。而且，由于 Mistral 是以磁力链的形式发布的，因此该聊天机器人 “基本上不可能从互联网上审查或删除”。

老王点评：这不仅仅打开了潘多拉魔盒，而是制造了一个！]]></summary>

在费城有一位很霸气地名为沃尔多·爱默生·纳尔逊（Waldo Emerson Nelson）的雄心勃勃的儿科医生，他在1941年成了美国最为知名的儿科教科书的主编。在接下来的半个世纪里，这本大部头教科书及其后续版本的编撰工作推动了他的事业发展，耗费了他的周末，也严重地影响了他的家庭生活。每隔几年，当新版准备付梓时，他都会动员全家人为他编制索引。他会通读大约一千五百页的校样，念出要列出的单词和概念，而他的妻子玛吉和三个孩子——简、安和比尔——则在索引卡片上写下成千上万的条目及其相应的页码。
虽然纳尔逊是一位出色的医生，但即使是最欣赏他的同事，也会震惊于他“朴素而严厉”的外表、“粗粝的表情”和“花岗岩般的是非信念”。他曾自豪地回忆自己对待年轻医生的态度：“我每次与实习医生谈话时，他们都不知是该笑还是该哭。我就喜欢这样。”因此当他那三个亲生的童工抱怨繁琐的索引工作时，他引用1950年版《纳尔逊儿科教科书》开篇献词作为回应，也就不足为奇了：
我们认识到儿童和成人一样，在必须完成的任务的刺激和责任下才会成长，
故此我们鸣谢
本书通过向
简、安和比尔
提供如此宝贵机会而为他们带来的裨益，以及集体活动给家庭生活带来的满足感
我们如今理所当然地认为，无论编撰工作如何繁琐，任何类型的学术书籍都应该编制索引。这项工具是如此宝贵，对我们思考和使用信息的方式是如此重要，以至于在多卷本的学术著作中，常常见到索引本身构成了一整本书。然而这种…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[为 Linux 桌面或者 Steam Deck 做好游戏准备，听起来都很刺激！


对于一个专为 Linux 游戏定制的发行版，你是否感兴趣呢？

如果答案是肯定的，那么我们为你准备了绝佳选择。

Bazzite 是一个新推出的基于 Fedora 的发行版，它是为 Linux 桌面上的游戏，以及越来越火热的 Steam Deck 定制的。

在此文章中，我们将对 Bazzite 进行简短总结，并探讨其优势。

⭐ Bazzite：概述



Bazzite 基于最新发布的 Fedora 38，使用的是 Universal Blue —— Fedora 的一个 OCI 基础镜像。它提供了扩展硬件支持，如 微软 Surface 设备，并预先安装了关键驱动。


🚧 基于 Fedora 39 的构建也可供测试。你可以关注下个月末发布的稳定版。


它的一些亮点包括：


预装专有的英伟达驱动

支持硬件加速的 H264 解码

引入了 Waydroid，允许运行安卓应用

由于实现了 xone、xpadneo 和 xpad-noone，所以支持 Xbox 手柄


👨‍💻 初步印象

我在 虚拟机 上尝试了 Bazzite，发现其安装体验极其接近 Fedora。但在安装过后，你会发现它的独特之处。

Bazzite 默认使用的是 KDE Plasma 5.27 桌面环境，并在整个操作系统中融入了整洁的 Steam Deck 风格。

它还为 PC 和 Steam Deck 提供了 独立的 ISO，包括一个面向 英伟达的版本，以及一个如果你不喜欢 KDE，可以选择的 GNOME 版本。

在设置发行版用于游戏时，我使用了 “Bazzite Portal” 应用，它引导我走过了一些重要的配置步骤。如果你需要，此处你也可以安装 Open Razer。



首先，它设置了 Bazzite Arch，它是一个自定义的 Arch Linux OCI，运行在 Distrobox 中，支持 Steam、Lutris 等在其内运行游戏。



在配置了一些其他选项之后，开始了应用程序的安装，呈现了许多包含各种类别的特定用例的最热门应用。



完成设置之后，你就拥有了一款专为游戏设计的操作系统 😲



最近，通过一个更新，Bazzite 新增了两款预装应用：


Mission Control（系统监视器应用）

Discover Overlay（一个用于 Discord overlay 的应用）




这里还有我跳过的一些其他配置选项。

Bazzite 可以利用 Nix 包管理器，在启动时以大屏幕模式启动 Steam，提供了内存调节的选项 等等。

这个概念听起来极具趣味性，如果你一直在寻找像 Nobara 那样，基于 Fedora 的、对游戏进行优化的发行版，你可以试试 Bazzite。

📥 下载 Bazzite

如果你对 Bazzite 提供的功能感兴趣，你可以在其 GitHub 仓库 中下载最新版本。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[这里有一些有趣的东西供你尝试！


这是一款有趣的开源工具，具有非常特定的用途。

CBconvert 是漫画书转换器，可以将漫画转换为不同的格式以适合各种设备。

对我个人来说，这将是第一次，因为我以前从未尝试过这样的转换器。在此，我将探讨并重点介绍这款工具的功能。


🚧 该应用相当新，正在积极开发中。期待事情发生改变。


⭐ CBconvert：概述



CBconvert 主要使用 Go 语言编写，旨在成为满足你所有漫画书转换需求的一站式应用。

它可以读取最常见的文件格式，例如 CBR（RAR）、XPS、CB7（7Z）、CBT（TAR）、PDF 等。

你可以将这些文件转换为两种不同的格式：CBZ（ZIP）和 CBT（TAR）。

不要认为 CBconvert 的唯一目的是转换漫画书，你还可以使用它进行一些视觉调整。我稍后会讨论这个问题。

主要功能：


有用的编辑工具

漫画书转换

从漫画中提取封面图片


事不宜迟，让我们深入了解 CBconvert。

👨‍💻 初步印象

虽然转换器可以在 Linux、Windows 和 macOS 上运行，但我在 Linux 系统上进行了尝试。

我首先使用侧边栏菜单中的“添加文件Add Files”选项向应用添加一些漫画（公共领域获取）。我能够添加多部漫画，没有遇到很多问题。

同样，我继续查看各种功能选项卡。

第一个选项卡名为“输入Input”，包含一些选项，例如设置最小大小限制、仅选择灰度图像等等。我不需要使用这些，但如果你想向要转换的文件添加先决条件，这些选项肯定很有用。



第二个选项卡是你可以进行漫画转换的地方，它被称为“输出Output”。我设置了输出目录，并选择了 “ZIP” 存档格式来获取 .cbz 文件输出。

它还可以选择向输出文件添加后缀，并从存档中删除任何非图像文件，如下所示。



设置完所有输出设置后，我单击“转换Convert”。然后它开始一张一张地处理所有的漫画。操作速度很快，达到了预期的最终结果。



你可能想知道：为什么这个封面看起来和以前的不一样？

好吧，在转换这些漫画之前，我冒昧地尝试调整漫画书的视觉效果。

感谢“变换Transform”选项卡，它允许我尝试各种设置，例如亮度、对比度、输入/输出级别等。



我想说，此功能需要进一步完善，由于预览时未实时反映更改，因此需要一些时间才能显示更改。


📋 请记住，我不必选择其他漫画，所有漫画都与“夜魔侠”一起接受了相同的调整。


然后，有第三个选项卡，名为“图像Image”，它允许我以各种图像格式导出封面照片，例如 JPEG、PNG、TIFF、WebP 等。



CBconvert 还具有一些选项来从封面图片创建缩略图、调整图像质量、将其变成灰度，甚至对其应用一些调整大小的滤镜。

📥 获取 CBconvert

对于其他平台，你可以从 GitHub 存储库获取最新版本的 CBconvert，对于 Linux，你可以选择 Flathub 中的 Flathub 包。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[适用于 Linux 的现代新闻阅读器应用获得超级升级。


NewsFlash 是一个简洁的程序，可让你关注你最喜爱的新闻网站和博客。作为现已不复存在的 FeedReader 的精神继承者，它与许多现有的基于网络的 RSS 阅读器（如 Inoreader 和 Feedly）很好地集成，并且还支持本地 订阅源Feed。

不要忘记，NewsFlash 是 Linux 上最好的订阅源阅读器桌面应用 之一。

NewsFlash 3.0 升级后，应用有许多重要的改进。

🆕 NewsFlash 3.0：有什么新内容？



NewsFlash 具有调整后的界面布局，并使用 libadwaita 1.4 的“分割视图”和“工具栏视图”。

这可以显示无边框标题栏 ，其中 三列的外观略有不同。侧边栏和文章列表的调整大小行为也得到了改进。

同样，通过使用 GTK 4.12 的“列表视图”部分，文章列表得到了改进，并且文章现在按天/日期分组。

然而，这些并不是此版本的唯一亮点，以下是一些值得注意的亮点：


更好的性能

改进的缩略图

拖放功能

图像查看器


更好的性能

得益于 Tokio 运行时 的实现，NewsFlash 3.0 现在快了很多，它允许在单个 Tokio 运行时实例上进行异步处理。

简而言之，该应用更加快捷，因为它以更优化的方式处理请求。因此，同步、将文章标记为已读以及抓取完整文章内容等操作现在要快得多。

改进的缩略图



NewsFlash 中添加了启发式进程，它现在可以根据订阅源中的文章生成缩略图。

它应该从文章的 HTML 代码中收集“相关”图像，并将其用作缩略图。

然而，正如你在我们的 Element X 新闻文章中看到的那样，它从文章中抓取了图像，而不是获取题图。随着未来的更新，这应该会变得更好。

拖放功能

现在，你可以拖放侧边栏上的元素，将订阅源从一个类别移动到另一个类别，并对列表重新排序。

图像查看器



使用 NewsFlash 3.0，你现在可以单击文章中的图像，在专用图像查看窗口中查看它们。同样用于显示文章的图像附件。

🛠️ 其他更改和改进

至于其他变化，以下是一些技术改进：


添加了对 Commafeed 的支持。

在移动设备上对订阅源的订阅已得到改进。

NewsFlash 现在会记住应用重新启动时的窗口状态。

“编辑”对话框已得到改进，更好地支持特殊字符和符号。


你可以浏览开发者的 官方博客 来探索此版本的一些技术细节。

📥 下载 NewsFlash 3.0

你可以前往 Flathub 商店 获取最新版本的 NewsFlash。

它也有 Snap 包。但是，在撰写本文时，它尚未更新到最新版本。

 Can anyone send me a link to the source code that’ll enable me to recreate flathub’s backend?

 I haven't touched them for a few months, not since late spring, so there were lots of upgrades to apply in both. Comparable numbers of packages including new kernels. Peppermint OS took about 5 minutes. Solus is still chugging along after 55 minutes. Differemt download speeds could explain some of the difference in duration, but eopkg said it was done downloading 20 minutes ago.
 Are there any benchmark studies for software managers? I'm seriously underwhelmed by eopkg.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I look on ebay and there's a bunch of really outdated laptops. They're usually loaded with something similar to Ubuntu, but sometimes you come across Kali. There's pretty much everything.
 The one thing all of these laptops have in common is they wouldn't be able to run windows on recommended specs and they usually sell them for $70-$120.
 My big confusion when it comes to this is if you wanted a linux computer wouldn't you be computer literate enough to load linux yourself? Why are people paying extra money for something they can do themselves anyway?
 Specifically Kali, if you even know what Kali Linux is, you *should* be able to make a bootable USB drive as well. I don't get it.

 I'll say right away, some of the criticism I don't approve of. For example, I find the motd ads to be quite acceptable, and they even had some useful functionality to some extent, despite all the negativity that has been spewed.
 However, there is something that I would like to point out as very significant and something that may (or already has) made me give up on this distribution. For example:
  
they once announced that they wanted to drop support for x32 libraries in the distribution. This was first announced as a fact (i.e. without any community discussion as such), and then they, if I may,…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[NetFilter is a “Free and Open Source” (FOSS) project that provides packet filtering software for Linux (kernel 2.4 version and later). The main features provided by NetFilter are: stateless packet filtering (IPv4/IPv6), stateful packet filtering (IPv4/IPv6), different kinds of network/port address translations (NAT/PAT), packet logging, userspace packet queuing and other packet mangaling (https://www.netfilter.org/). Thus, NetFilter is used for creating Firewalls (stateless/stateful), NAT based transparent proxies and other packet manipulation technologies.
 One of the most important features of NetFilter is “Connection Tracking”. It allows the kernel to keep track of all the sessions/network connections in order to relate all the packets that make up a connection (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netfilter). We can interface with the connection tracking feature using the “conntrack” CLI tool (https://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/trusty/man8/conntrack.8.html).
 Moreover, NetFilter provides “netfilter hooks” which enables using callbacks to provide filtering inside the Linux kernel. There are five different types of “netfilter hooks”: “Pre-Routing”, “Input”, “Forward”, “Output” and “Post-Routing” — as shown in the diagram below (https://wiki.nftables.org/wiki-nftables/index.php/Netfilter_hooks).
 Lastly, there are different tools that leverage NetFilter like: iptables, arptables, ebtables and nftables (more on them in future writeups). We can also go over the source code of “NetFilter” as part of the Linux kernel (https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v6.5.5/source/net/netfilter).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Linux 基金会是世界上最大的“软件公司”

Linux 基金会执行董事 Jim Zemlin 在上海举办的 KubeCon 上发表演讲，他开玩笑地说，“Linux 基金会很可能是世界上最大的软件公司”。他指出，如果把软件开发人员的平均工资（假定全球平均工资为 4 万美元）乘以为基金会做出贡献的开发人员人数，工资总额将达到约 260 亿美元，超过微软 240 亿美元的研发工资总额。当然，为 Linux 基金会项目工作的开发人员实际上都不为 Linux 基金会工作，因此这一统计数字并不能当真。

老王点评：说 Linux 基金会是个企业其实也没错，只是这个企业经营模式不太一样罢了。




人工智能语言模型在无损压缩方面可超越 PNG 和 FLAC

研究人员详细介绍了他们的发现：名为 Chinchilla 70B 的 DeepMind 大型语言模型（LLM）可以将 ImageNet 图像数据库中的图像片段无损压缩至原始大小的 43.4%，超过了将相同数据压缩至 58.5% 的 PNG 算法。在音频方面，Chinchilla 可将 LibriSpeech 音频数据集的样本压缩至原始大小的 16.4%，超过 FLAC 压缩的 30.3%。结果表明，尽管 Chinchilla 70B 主要是为处理文本而训练的，但它在压缩其他类型的数据时也出奇地有效，往往比专门为这些任务设计的算法更好。


消息来源：Ars Technica



老王点评：所以，以后图片和音频会有一种 AIC 格式么？




人工智能驱动的必应聊天回复中被注入了恶意广告

微软于 2023 年 2 月推出了由 OpenAI 的 GPT-4 引擎驱动的必应聊天工具。今年 3 月，微软开始在必应聊天对话中注入广告，以从这一新平台中创收。研究人员发现，当你询问必应聊天如何下载 “Advanced IP Scanner”时，它会在聊天中显示一个下载链接。但是，当你将鼠标悬停在聊天中的下划线链接上时，必应聊天可能会先显示广告，然后再显示合法的下载链接。在这种情况下，赞助链接就是推送恶意软件的恶意广告。这种类似于对话的互动会让人工智能提供的 URL 充满错位的权威感和可信度，因此搜索平台中现有的恶意广告问题因人工智能助手的引入而被放大。


消息来源：Bleeping Computer



老王点评：投放恶意广告并不稀奇，只是这种对话式的场景，容易让人放松警惕。]]></summary>

 One thing that seems to have changed are how many small updates trigger a reboot prompt. If I remember correctly, I’m the past it was generally kernel updates that really only required a reboot. 
 Is it just my imagination or do updates now require reboots a lot of the time?
 Update to adduser requires a reboot for example.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[正如风沙湮没的楼兰古国，或盛极一时的吴哥王朝，玛雅文明的前置限定语通常是“神秘消失”——这个绵延三千年，在天文、历法及建筑、雕刻等方面成就卓著的热带雨林文明，在十六世纪西班牙殖民者入侵后遭受毁灭性打击，不仅楼台宫墙荡然无存，连经书、文字也湮没无闻。长期以来，西方学界对玛雅文明盛衰的原因做出了种种推论——其中最离谱的是殷商遗民和外星人说——为正本清源，美国宾夕法尼亚大学人类学教授罗伯特·J.沙雷尔（Robert J. Sharer）和新墨西哥大学助理教授洛·P.特拉克勒斯（Loa P. Traxler）在《玛雅史：失落的世界第五大文明》一书中，以翔实的史料论证玛雅文明的轨迹大致遵循“崛起-没落-复兴-衰亡”这一寻常套路，周而复始，但始终跳不出所谓“历史周期律”。

《玛雅史：失落的世界第五大文明》，[美]罗伯特·J.沙雷尔 / [美]洛·P.特拉克斯勒著，杨靖 等译，浙江文艺出版社，2023年7月版，1048页，238.00元

事实上，早在十六世纪玛雅文明彻底消失之前，它已然经历过史上最严重的一次“没落”——公元九世纪，它突然从古典期的黄金时代跌落谷底：大批城市被废弃，艺术珍品被毁损，人口大量减少，玛雅人似乎重回远古蛮荒时代。本书作者假设，倘若哥伦布没有发现新大陆，玛雅人极有可能继续在他们的怪圈中裹足不前，因为他们的文化基因中缺乏创新动力。正如沙雷尔教授在他的另一部巨著《玛雅文明的日常生活》（Daily Life in Maya Civilization）中所言，与世界其他四大文明相比，玛雅的盛衰毫无独特之处，更无神秘可言——它唯一的教训是，倘若我们也固步自封，“那么玛雅的昨天就是我们的明天”。
一、“外因说”
玛雅号称帝国，但历史上它从未能建立起大一统的帝国，相反，相继而起的王国更类似于希腊半岛的城邦。在历史的长河中，伟大的玛雅城市（王国）如纳克贝（Nakbe）、埃尔米拉…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[开源游戏引擎万岁！


继 Unity 制定了会在游戏安装或启动时向开发者收取费用的掠夺性 “运行时费用” 定价模式之后，《泰拉瑞亚Terraria》的开发商 Re-Logic 承诺将会支持两个新兴的开源游戏引擎。

尽管 Unity 的定价模式 已进行了调整，但对玩家以及开发者的信任已经被打破。许多游戏开发商不得不采取预防措施来限制成本。

那么，让我们看看 Re-Logic 都承诺了些什么。

巨大贡献 💰

他们最近在 Twitter 上宣布了两件大事。

第一，他们谴责 Unity 提出的定价模式改革，提到了以下几点：


我们明确谴责并拒绝接受 Unity 最近提出的服务条款/收费变更，以及推出这些变更的暗箱操作方式。

最令人痛心的是，Unity 多年来培养的信任被轻描淡写地抛到了一边，成为压榨发行商、工作室和玩家的又一种方式。


他们还补充说，一份简单的公开声明不足以挽回这样的事情，被破坏的信任，不可能轻易修复。

不过，该公告的第二项主要亮点是他们承诺向开源游戏引擎 Godot 和 FNA 各捐赠 100,000 美元。

而且，这还不够，他们还决定赞助这些项目，每个项目的赞助费为每月 1000 美元，只有一个很简单的要求：


作为回报，我们所要求的只是他们保持良好的品格，继续尽其所能为世界各地的开发人员提供功能强大、易于使用的引擎。


这是一个很好的回报要求！ 😄

尽管《泰拉瑞亚》的手机和游戏机移植版使用的是 Unity（由第三方维护），但这并不妨碍他们对这种情况发表意见。

你可以在原 公告推文 上关注围绕此事发表的讨论，了解用户和游戏开发者的更多想法。

是时候闪亮登场了吗？



我觉得，是的！

鉴于大多数流行的游戏引擎，要么是需要付费的闭源引擎，要么是仅供游戏开发者自用的引擎（说的就是你 RAGE ），因此像 Godot 和 FNA 这样的开源游戏引擎是当务之急。

很高兴看到 Re-Logic 这样的热门游戏开发商尝试支持开源游戏引擎，我们已经有一段时间没有看到这样的努力了。

我希望通过这件事，更多的开发者会对支持开源游戏引擎产生浓厚的兴趣，无论他们以何种方式，可以是金钱，也可以是贡献代码。

💬 你对此怎么看？可以在下方分享你的想法。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Firefox 118 让用户更轻松地翻译网页。


近期，Mozilla 积极努力改进 Firefox，以使其在各方面都更强大，例如针对谷歌的 Web 服务提供更强大的 支持，以及之前发布的 Firefox 117 版本。

现在，Firefox 的新版本 118 来到了我们面前，它终于带来了注重隐私保护的原生翻译功能，无需寻找临时解决方案。

让我们一起深入了解新版本能为我们带来什么。

🆕 Firefox 118：有哪些新特性？



和之前的版本一样，Firefox 118 提供了很多新特性，其中一些主要的亮点包括：


原生的浏览器翻译

谷歌会议的功能增强

重要的安全更新


首先，我们会关注到原生的翻译功能，然后再逐一了解其他的特性。

原生且内置的翻译功能

经过一段时期的测试后，Firefox 最终获得了原生支持浏览器内部的翻译功能。我们在 Firefox 117 版本 中测试过这个功能，但并未设置为默认开启。

现在，只需要简单的几次点击就能启动翻译，如同视频中展示的那样。你需要进入汉堡菜单，然后点击 “翻译此页Translate page”，选择来源语言和你想要翻译成的语言，然后点击 “翻译Translate”。

如果你想返回原文，只需点击地址栏中的翻译图标，再点击 “显示原文Show original”。

在我实际使用过程中，这个功能在处理具有多种语言的网页时有一些问题，并且不支持从图像或视频中翻译文本。

但是请注意，翻译工具依然标注为 “Beta” 版本。我有信心，在未来几个月，开发者将会提供更多更新以改进其功能。

🛠️ 其他的更变与改进

关于其他的底层优化：


对于 谷歌会议，Firefox 用户现在可以使用视频特效和背景模糊这类新功能。

Firefox 建议 的用户现在将可以在地址栏看到浏览器插件的建议（仅适用于美国用户）。

为了防止在隐私浏览窗口中进行字体指纹跟踪，网站上字体的可见性已被限制为仅显示系统字体。

Firefox 现在使用 FDLIBM 数学库来处理 Web 音频，以提高隐私保护。

进行了各种 安全修补。


你还可以浏览官方的 版本发布说明，以更深入地了解一些技术问题。

📥 下载 Mozilla Firefox 118

你可以在 官方网站 中下载 Firefox 118 版本，提供的格式有 .tar.bz2 包 ，或者可以在 Flathub 商店 中 获取 Flatpak。

此外，你也可以尝试 Firefox 的 Snap 包。


Mozilla Firefox 118


对于已经安装的用户： 你可以在设置菜单中搜索 “更新Update”，然后点击 “检查更新Check for Updates” 或者检查系统更新以从软件库中获取。

💬 自从新的翻译功能发布，你是否为之振奋？你期待 Firefox 在未来会推出什么样的更新呢？请在评论区告诉我们你的想法！

        <id>https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37695530</id>
        <link href="https://github.com/fill3d/fill"/>
        <updated>2023-09-28T20:41:30.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey all,
You've probably seen projects that add objects to an image from a style or text prompt, like InteriorAI (levelsio) and Adobe Firefly. The prevalent issue with these diffusion-based inpainting approaches is that they don't yet have great conditioning on lighting, perspective, and structure. You'll often get incorrect or generic shadows; warped-looking objects; and distorted backgrounds.
What is Fill 3D?
Fill 3D is an exploration on doing generative fill in 3D to render ultra-realistic results that harmonize with the background image, using industry-standard path tracing, akin to compositing in Hollywood movies.
How does it work?
1. Deproject: First, deproject an image to a 3D shell using both geometric and photometric cues from the input image.
2. Place: Draw rectangles and describe what you want in them, akin to Photoshop's Generative Fill feature.
3. Render: Use good ol' path tracing to render ultra-realistic results.
Why Fill 3D?
+ The results are insanely realistic (see video in the github repo, or on the website).
+ Fast enough: Currently, generations take 40-80 seconds. Diffusion takes ~10seconds, so we're slower, but for the level of realism, it's pretty good.
+ Potential applications: I'm thinking of virtual staging in real estate media, what do you think?
Check it out at https://fill3d.ai
+ There's API access! :D
+ Right now, you need an image of an empty room. Will loosen this restriction over time.
Fill 3D is built on Function (https://fxn.ai). With Function, I can run the Python functions that do the steps above on powerful GPUs with only code (no Dockerfile, YAML, k8s, etc), and invoke them from just about anywhere. I'm the founder of fxn.
Tell me what you think!!
PS: This is my first Show HN, so please be nice :)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I found that this service will sometimes max out a CPU thread and just sit at 100% usage indefinitely.
 This cut my laptop's battery life down to a third of what it should be (even in reduced power mode). It also causes the laptop to get unnecessarily hot.
 According to systemd, it's service and socket are disabled, but the process was still running in my case. I fixed it with sudo chmod -x /usr/bin/nordfileshared and then killed all instances of it.
 Please lmk if anyone else has this issue with nordvpn's linux application.
 For reference: i'm running Arch with the nordvpn-bin AUR package.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[俄罗斯零日卖家出价 2000 万美元购买安卓和 iPhone 漏洞

一家名为“零点行动”的公司的业务是收购并销售零日漏洞（即受影响的开发者不知道的软件缺陷）。它现在提出将向研究人员支付 2000 万美元，用于购买黑客工具，使其客户能够黑进 iPhone 和安卓设备。之前他们的悬赏费用是 20 万美元，现在提供的悬赏可能是暂时的，反映了市场的特殊时期，以及黑客入侵 iOS 和安卓的难度。

老王点评：都这么值钱了吗？那说明一定有值得这个价钱的目标存在。




谷歌播客将关闭

谷歌宣布其播客服务将在 2024 年关闭，成为最新一个被搜索巨人杀死的产品，而 YouTube Music 将加入播客功能。用户在谷歌播客上订阅的播客将能通过工具迁移到 YouTube Music。而 YouTube Music 将支持通过 RSS 订阅源添加播客，包括未托管在 YouTube 上的播客节目。


消息来源：Youtube



老王点评：其实谷歌一开始建立了很多很好、很受技术人群喜爱和依赖的服务，但是奈何这些技术人群没有什么经济价值，于是就一个个关闭了。




人工智能生成的 “潜意识信息” 正在疯传

最近一项名为 “控制网ControlNet” 人工智能技术开始流行，人们用它创建能让用户产生视错觉的图片。这项技术本质是让用户通过指定额外的输入来控制生成的图像，用户可以在其他图像中创建图像或文字。比如我们之前 介绍 过，用它来创建嵌入在图画中的二维码，以及棋盘式的图画。一些用户认为这是一种 “隐性信息”，可用于以微妙的视觉提示形式植入建议，比如在电影海报的轮廓中出现麦当劳的 “M” 标志。


消息来源：VICE



老王点评：这种技术再发展下去，你看到图片其实会暗示你另外一些信息，人类被愚弄而不自知。

昨天我们 说到 了苹果并未真的考虑过在其产品中替换谷歌搜索引擎，现在，微软必应高管 表示，苹果利用必应报价作为对谷歌的“谈判筹码”。]]></summary>

在当下全球性的冲突政治中，“极端主义”（Extremism）这个概念虽然一直存在，但是与恐怖主义、种族主义、民族主义等概念相比，其定义和面目总是比较模糊。更不用说在国家与族群边界之内，究竟如何辨别何谓极端主义，比较混乱。假如是在主流意识形态和社会大部分人的价值观念实际上已经被极端主义思维方式严重侵蚀的语境中，在西方“政治正确”或“政治禁忌”的阴影下更加无法展开对极端主义思潮的认真研究和自由的公共讨论，导致在充满暴力和戾气的社会混乱背后的极端主义思潮被模糊化。因此，关于极端主义的思考与讨论实际上已经是思想界和公共舆论面临的重要而迫切的任务。在这种背景下，美国学者J. M. 伯杰（J. M. Berger）的《极端主义》（原书名Extremism ，Cambridge，MA: MIT Press，2018）尤为值得阅读。

Extremism    By J. M. Berger    2018  MIT Press Essential Knowledge series

该书原版的封面设计是红与黑，高举着AK47与旗帜的人群，很能传达出极端主义的形象特征和氛围。究竟什么是极端主义、极端主义意识形态是如何构建的以及为什么极端主义会升级为暴力等问题，J. M.伯杰在这本书中作了深入的介绍和阐释。他的研究表明，尽管极端主义运动的意识形态内容差异很大，但存在共同的结构要素；只有了解其原因和共同要素，我们才能有效地打击和遏制极端主义行为。
J. M.伯杰既是研究极端主义、恐怖主义、意识形态宣传、社交媒体和语义分析技术的专家，同时也是与研究本土恐怖主义、在线极端主义、高级社交媒体分析和打击暴力极端主义等问题和政策相关的社交媒体公司和政府机构的顾问，SOLVE网络顾问委员会的成员和《大…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[据报道，多位知情人士今日称，微软在2020年左右曾考虑将必应（Bing）搜索引擎出售给苹果公司，以便让苹果在iOS设备上放弃谷歌搜索。


这些知情人士表示，微软高管当时曾与苹果服务主管Eddy Cue会面，讨论将必应出售给苹果的可能性。但最终，谈判只是试探性的，并未进入深入探讨阶段。


多年来，这两家公司一直在讨论如何让必应搜索成为iOS设备的默认搜索引擎，尽管苹果最终还是坚持使用了谷歌搜索。但如今，鉴于美国司法部正与谷歌展开法律战，以表明谷歌滥用其在搜索领域的主导地位，微软和苹果的相关谈判又具有了新的意义。


对于谷歌诉讼案，苹果与谷歌之间的关系是该案的核心所在。因为谷歌每年向苹果支付数十亿美元，以确保其搜索引擎成为iPhone和其他iOS设备的默认选项。


对此，微软和苹果的代表拒绝发表评论。


微软在2009年推出了必应搜索，旨在挑战竞争对手谷歌，但并未获得太大的市场份额。如今，谷歌仍然统治着这个行业，而必应的份额还不到10%。


如今，苹果和微软都卷入了美国司法部对谷歌的诉讼。这起诉讼正在进行中，而两家公司的高管也都出庭作证。司法部称，谷歌与苹果之间的交易，就是谷歌不公平地主导搜索市场的证据。但在本周早些时候的证词中，苹果高管Eddy Cue驳斥了这一说法，称苹果使用谷歌搜索是因为它是可用的最佳选项。


早在2002年，苹果和谷歌达成了第一项搜索引擎协议，当时苹果发布了第一款Mac网络浏览器Safari。随着时间的推移，该协议又扩展到了苹果的其他设备中，最引人注目的就是iPhone。根据美国司法部的数据，到2020年，苹果每年从这一安排中获得40亿美元至70亿美元的收入。


如今，两家公司之间的协议涵盖iPhone、iPad和Mac上的Safari网络浏览器。谷歌通过上述设备上的Safari浏览器获得的收入，苹果会从中获得一定比例的分成。


知情人士称，谷歌交易所带来的丰厚收入，正是苹果拒绝收购必应的一个关键原因。此外，苹果还担心必应在质量和能力上不及谷歌搜索。


尽管如此，苹果还是在部分业务中使用了必应搜索。2013年至2017年，必应成为了苹果语音助手Siri和Spotlight的默认搜索引擎。Spotlight是一项从iPhone和iPad主屏进行搜索的功能。但作为更新后的营收分成协议的一部分，苹果在2017年又恢复了与谷歌的合作，尽管必应仍是Safari搜索的一个选择。


昨晚，微软业务开发高管Jon Tinter在法庭上表示，2016年微软还曾考虑过向苹果投资数十亿美元，以便让必应成为苹果设备的默认搜索引擎。当时，微软CEO萨蒂亚·纳德拉（Satya Nadella）和苹果CEO蒂姆·库克（Tim Cook）还为此举行了会谈。


目前，谷歌仍是Siri和Spotlight的搜索引擎，也是Safari的默认选项。在作证期间，Eddy Cue表示，苹果和谷歌的交易在2021年得到了延长。这距离微软考虑向苹果出售必应已经过去了一年甚至更久。


Eddy Cue也暗示过，必应的技术不如谷歌。他说，如果与谷歌的谈判破裂，他也不知道该怎么收场。


分析人士称，如果苹果真的收购了必应，也不太可能简单地将其整合到自己的平台上。在以往的收购中，苹果都是在购买了基础技术和资源后，又构建一项新功能。


Eddy Cue在证词中强调，苹果认为没有必要开发自己的搜索工具，因为谷歌显然是最佳选择。这与苹果在其他领域的做法不同，例如，苹果在地图软件、语音助手，以及手机和电脑操作系统方面，均与谷歌展开了竞争。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Matrix 2.0 协议已发布。如果你是早期用户，现在就可以试用！


Matrix 是一种开源的去中心化通信协议。

你可以将其集成到你的服务中，自行托管 Matrix 服务器，或从选定的托管提供商处购买服务器。而且，要开始与其通信，你可以使用这几个 最佳 Matrix 客户端 之一。

Matrix 协议非常适合隐私和安全，并被政府、组织和个人采用。然而，它尚未成功取代 WhatsApp、Telegram 或 iMessage 等中心化消息应用的流行度。

为了解决这个问题，Matrix.org 宣布了下一代协议，即 Matrix 2.0。

🚧 Matix 2.0 x Element X：正在进行中

Matrix 2.0 旨在关注可用性和性能。

根据官方公告，可能的功能包括：


滑动同步（即时登录/同步）

原生 Open ID Connect（身份验证协议）

原生群组 VoIP（用于大规模加密语音和视频通话）

更快的远程加入


这听起来像是改善通信体验的可靠新功能。

然而，所有这些还不是当前 Matrix 规范的一部分。所以，作为用户，你必须等待。

但是，对于任何想要测试改进的开发人员来说，都可以在 Matrix 2.0 客户端的帮助下进行测试，这就是 Element X 的用武之地。

你还可以选择探索其他支持的 Matrix 客户端，目前 Element X 是 Matrix 2.0 的测试环境。



Element X 是我们所知的 Element 消息应用 开发中的后续版本。它的目标是超越 WhatsApp、iMessage 和 Telegram 等消息应用🤯。



Element X 的亮点包括：


端到端加密多方 VoIP 和视频通话

由于采用 Rust 编写的核心，有简化的 UI 和快速的性能

富文本编辑器 UI

支持位置共享和投票




当然，这是一个大目标。根据我使用 Element 应用的经验，它设法提供了良好的体验，但无法取代 WhatsApp/Telegram。

因此，看看他们如何在利用 Matrix 2.0 协议的同时改进 Element X 应该很有趣。我在我的安卓手机上对其进行了快速测试，看起来性能有所提高📈。

除非你想成为该应用的早期采用者并希望向开发人员提供有关其进度的反馈，否则你可能需要等待。

当然，现在下结论还为时过早，因为 Element X 仍然没有许多功能，并且随着他们继续测试和实现 Matrix 2.0 协议功能，只会变得更好。

但是，我很兴奋！ 🤩

有关 Matrix 2.0 的所有技术细节，请参阅 官方公告。而且，如果你热衷于探索 Element X 的计划，请前往其官方 博客。

💬 你如何看待 Element 的下一代版本和 Matrix 2.0 计划？ 在下面的评论中分享你的想法。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[无需再等待！Linux Mint 的 Debian 版本升级已经发布了。


我们期待已久！

去年，Linux Mint Debian Editon（LMDE）发布了一个重要的版本 LMDE 5，并带来了一些比较不错的改进。

今年，我们迎来了 LMDE 6 版本，代号为 “Faye”。它采用了与以往版本相似的命名方式。

让我们看看这一新版本有什么引人注目的地方！

Linux Mint Debian Edition 6 “Faye”: 有什么新功能？



LMDE 6 由 Debian 的最新的稳定发行版 Debian 12 支持，具有所有改进、错误修复和新功能等等。

你可以期待在 Linux Mint 21.2 中看到所有精彩功能。

新版本的一些主要亮点:


基于 Linux 内核 6.1

Cinnamon 桌面升级

改进后的软件包管理器



💡 LMDE 只是另一个版本的 Linux Mint，它基于 Debian，而非 Ubuntu，在功能实现上与 Linux Mint 主版本保持同步。


Linux 内核 6.1



LMDE 6 使用了长期支持的 Linux 内核 6.1 版本，从而获得了 Rust 的实验支持、对英特尔 Meteor Lake 芯片和 AMD 的 RDNA 3 图形芯片的 初始支持。

Cinnamon 的升级



此外，使用了 Cinnamon 5.8 作为 LMDE 6 的默认桌面，它作为 Linux Mint 的旗舰桌面环境，提供了很多实用功能。

比如，对窗口管理的手势支持、更好的窗口平铺与媒体控制、更强的工作区管理等等。

还有一个名为“风格Styles”的新设置项，它用于调整系统的整体外观，允许你为系统的不同元素设置不同的颜色。

我们建议你阅读我们关于 Linux Mint 21.2 发行版本的文章，以更好地了解 Cinnamon 的改进。

全新的软件包管理器



同样，我们现在也有了全面改版的软件包管理器，我们在 Linux Mint 21.2 版本中首次看到了它，现在它又出现在了 LMDE 6 中。

它采用了改良的布局，以方便使用，主页上的主要应用类别移到了更下方，搜索栏也移到了左侧。

此外，在应用程序的系统软件包与 Flatpak 之间进行选择也变得更加简单。

🛠️ 其他变化和改进

除上述更新外，还有一些变化值得一提：


新的登录屏幕；

为 Warpinator 提供更好的安全保障；

支持 HEIF 和 AVIF 图像；

“Mint-Y-Legacy” 主题更名为 “Mint-L”；

可以在文件管理器中为文件夹设置重点颜色。


有关此版本的更多详情，请参阅官方 发行说明。

📥 下载 LMDE 6 “Faye”

别忘了，LMDE 是为数不多的 支持 32 位系统的 Linux 发行版，当然也包括最新的 LMDE 6！

它有 32 位 与 64 位 两种版本，你可以前往 官方网站 获取你所需要的版本。

对于 LMDE 5 用户 ，可通过以下命令安装升级工具进行升级：

apt update
apt install mintupgrade


安装完成后，用以下命令启动图形用户界面升级工具：

sudo mintupgrade




按照屏幕上的说明进行操作，升级成功后，使用以下命令移除升级工具并重新启动：

apt remove mintupgrade
sudo reboot



LMDE 6 “Faye”


💬 你会体验 LMDE 6 吗？请告诉我们！

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi Hacker News! We’re Vadim and Chris from Highlight.io [1]. We do web app monitoring and are working on using LLMs/embeddings to add new functionality to our error monitoring product.
Given that there’s a lot of founders/engineers using LLMs in their products, we figured we’d share how we built the new functionality, their impact on our workflows, and how you can try it out.
Our goal was to build two features: (1) tagging errors (e.g. deeming an error as “authentication error” or a “database error”); and (2) grouping similar errors together (e.g. two errors that have a different stacktrace and body, but are semantically not very different).
Each of these rely heavily on comparing text across our application. After some experimentation with the OpenAI embeddings API [3], we went ahead  and…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi Everyone,
I built a tool for interactive navigation in the terminal that is intended to replace the all-too-familiar cycle of `ls` to view a directory, followed by `cd`, then `ls`, and repeat.
nav is a terminal filesystem explorer built for interactive `ls` workflows. The key features I wanted to enable are interactivity and search without feeling like I'm using anything other than `ls`. nav supports common `ls` options/flags, as well as tab completion, and might expand its support for less common options in the future. These options exist as both CLI flags and interactive toggles.
nav works as a standalone tool or in a bash/zsh pipe or subshell to e.g., change directories, copy a file name to the clipboard, etc. For example, I use the simple functions from the README in my .zshrc for interactive `cd` and copy-to-clipboard workflows.
nav was inspired by the discussion of the excellent `walk` [0] tool and was written from the ground up to support its `ls`-centric interactive feature set. I hope you might find it useful and I'd love to take any feedback or suggestions that might come to mind!

 I have to learn how to use arch stuff, got a spare machine here and without Mint it was a hassle.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[微软支持开发者用 Rust 开发 Windows 驱动

微软在 Github 上发布了代码，使开发人员能够用 Rust 编写 Windows 驱动程序，这是为操作系统实现内存安全编程的关键一步。此前，微软披露正在用 Rust 语言 重写 核心 Windows 库。由于各种技术和历史原因，Windows 的用户模式代码大部分都是用 C++ 编写的，而内核代码大部分是用 C 语言编写的。软件项目的大部分漏洞都属于内存安全错误。自 2006 年以来微软在 Windows 中修复的漏洞大约七成是内存安全漏洞。

老王点评：没想到 Windows 在拥抱 Rust 方面走在了 Linux 前面。




所有主要 GPU 都可能遭受新的像素窃取攻击

研究人员发现，六家主要供应商的 GPU 都容易受到一种新发现的攻击，这种攻击允许恶意网站跨源读取其他网站显示的像素。然后，攻击者就可以对像素进行重构，从而查看后一个网站显示的用户名、密码和其他敏感信息。通常情况下，同一来源策略会阻止这种泄漏，但 GPU 为提高性能而使用的数据压缩技术就像一个侧通道，会自动尝试压缩这些视觉数据，而不需要任何应用程序的参与。它们可以利用这个侧通道绕过限制，逐个窃取像素。芯片制造商们认为该问题的根本原因不在 GPU 中，而是浏览器厂商实现的问题。而谷歌表示，“这是对硬件工作原理的重要研究”，网站使用合理的标头可以显著减少个性化数据被泄露的风险。


消息来源：Ars Technica



老王点评：很多安全漏洞都是优化带来的，比如预加载、并行预测。




苹果在法庭上为谷歌搜索交易辩护

在对谷歌搜索业务的反垄断审判中，谷歌与苹果之间的交易是美国司法部起诉谷歌的核心，该交易使谷歌成为所有苹果设备的默认搜索引擎，并每年向苹果支付数十亿美元。曾代表苹果签署和谷歌的《信息服务协议》的 Eddy Cue 被问及，如果双方不能就收入分成数字达成一致，他是否会放弃这笔交易。Cue 认为，达成交易符合谷歌和苹果的最大利益，这笔交易不仅仅是经济问题，苹果从未认真考虑过转而使用其他供应商的产品，因为“还没有一个可以替代谷歌的有效选择”。


消息来源：The Verge



老王点评：就是因为其无可取代才会形成垄断。]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[郭嵩焘作为出使英国、兼使法国的清朝钦差大臣，对西洋事物有很大的求知欲和好奇心，在日记《使西纪程》中留下丰富的记录。一个半世纪过去，很多人物、事件对今人而言是陌生的，涉及外文的概念尤其费解，需要加以解释、翻译，方能令往事再现。
1874年英国新内阁
1877年5月2日，郭嵩焘买了一幅画，画的内容是当时的英国新内阁组成之际阁员会议的场面，全员出席，共十二人。对画中人物，他列出了一个名单：
……购得诸贤会议镜图一具，皆英国与闻政事者也。宰相（1）毕根士由、家部（2）克罗斯、户部（3）罗斯噶得、兵部（4）哈尔地、信部（5）满剌斯、印度部（6）沙乃斯百里、外部（7）德尔比：所识者七人。御前兼上议院长（8）铿恩斯、军机（9）理计门、海部（10）洼尔得亨得、藩部（11）家尔拿尔芬、别部（12）妈林斯百里：所不识者五人。（《伦敦与巴黎日记》光绪三年三月十九日，岳麓书社2008年修订本，181页；阿拉伯数字号码标注出自本文作者）
这幅画也不难查出就是《1874年比肯斯菲尔德内阁》（The Beaconsfield Cabinet 1874，图一，英国文化、媒体与体育部藏，https://artcollection.culture.gov.uk/artwork/18336/），表现的是1874年在唐宁街十号英国首相府举行内阁会议时的情景，原作系油画，画家是查尔斯・莫西尔（Charles Mercier，1834-1901）。现在广为流传的是勒蒙（Henry Lemon，1822-1902）据原作复制的版画。

图一，《1874年比肯斯菲尔德内阁》

英国政府大臣的名单不难凭借工具书和网络搜索引擎查到，郭嵩焘的名单可以复原如下：
（1）毕根士由：The Earl of Beaconsfield, First Lord of the Treasury宰相 = 比肯斯菲尔德，首相兼第一财政大臣。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[简单易学的指南，帮助你在 Windows 上安装 Oracle VirtualBox，以便在虚拟机中安装 Linux。


VirtualBox 是 最好的虚拟化软件 之一。

如果你想 使用 Windows 上的 VirtualBox，在虚拟机中安装 Linux，第一步是安装 VirtualBox 应用本身。

我们已经介绍了 在 Ubuntu 上安装 VirtualBox 的教程。让我重点介绍 Windows 系统的步骤。

对于最新的 Windows 10 或 11 及更早版本，步骤将相同。在 Windows 上安装 Oracle VirtualBox 的两种简单方法：


下载 Windows 版安装程序并按照屏幕上的说明进行操作

使用 winget 工具


1、使用 Windows 安装程序

要开始使用，请前往 VirtualBox 的官方下载页面。单击 “Windows host” 选项下载 .exe 安装程序。



下载安装程序（.exe）文件后，启动它后将执行以下操作：



安装指导允许你选择安装位置。你应该坚持使用 C: 驱动器上的默认设置，以确保安装 VirtualBox 所需的所有内容，使其按预期工作。



安装过程包括设置虚拟网络接口。因此，你的网络此时可能会被重置。确保安装时没有连接到任何重要的东西。



在对网络功能进行重整的同时，还需要处理一些依赖关系。

需要安装 Python 核心包才能使 Python 绑定正常工作。如果你不想使用 Python 脚本控制虚拟机，则不一定需要安装它。



但是，如果你认为将来可能需要它们，则应该将其与它一起安装。

现在，最终的安装过程将根据你上面的偏好开始，并且它将向你提供在关闭安装程序时启动 VirtualBox 的选项。



2、使用 winget 工具

winget 命令行工具使用 Windows 包管理器在 Windows 10 和 11 上搜索、安装、升级、删除和配置应用。

如果你更喜欢使用命令行，那么这就是适合你的方法。

首先，你需要以管理员身份启动命令提示符。



接下来，你需要使用 winget 命令来安装 VirtualBox。

这是要输入的命令：

winget install Oracle.VirtualBox



📋 如果你是第一次使用 winget，它会要求你同意这些条款。你需要接受它们才能继续使用它，同时你的一些数据（例如区域）将发送到微软商店。




下一步是启用虚拟化

你可以注意到，这两种方法都会安装适用于 Windows 的最新 VirtualBox 软件包。因此，你可以开始使用 VirtualBox 来创建和管理虚拟机。

但安装 VirtualBox 只是第一步。你应该通过调整一些设置来 确保你的 Windows 系统已做好虚拟化准备。以下是更多详细信息。


让你的 Windows 系统为虚拟机做好准备


💬 你在流程中遇到过任何问题吗？你更喜欢哪种方法？请在下面的评论中告诉我。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi everyone. After many many years of using Linux, I dropped it in 2020 after I stopped coding at work. Now, I'd like to come back but need to catch up, and would like to know how have things been in the Linux world?
 Despite Window$, I'm still using quite a few Linux Software particularly the ones from KDE (Kate, Okular, Kdenlive) and JetBrains for development (they support me for open source development) and even WSL. I also wear NVIDIA and play some triple A games.
  
is NVIDIA still a PITA, and distro depending, crashing Xorg after incompatible kernel Updates? How has Wayland been?
 
I know Valve and Steamedeck pushed a lot for gaming. How is AAA gaming now? Could I play Cyberpunk, Starfield, or Apex Legends?
 
Can I play Spotify in HIFI? How has DRM content been? Prime Video ond Netflix?
 
is everybody still fighting over snaps and flat paks, ALSA and PULSE, Xorg and Wayland? Because if so I love it
 
Any progress on modern hardware compatibility? I'd start with my desktop but I could toy around my surface pro 9 but I don't think so... I need battery life, suspend modes working well and great pen accuracy.
 
 Anyways, thanks and best of joys

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[利用 Just Perfection GNOME 扩展为你的 Linux 桌面带来全新的个性化定制体验。


GNOME 在 Linux 界中备受喜爱，是 最热门的桌面环境 之一。

然而，讨论到 GNOME 的可定制程度，你会发现与 KDE 相比，可供选择的选项相对较少。

这并不意味着我们无法 定制 GNOME。图形化的界面工具 GNOME 调整GNOME Tweaks 让你能轻松改变一些常规配置。而对于更深层次的设置更改，可以使用 dconf 编辑器，不过这对许多人可能略显复杂。

在此，我想向你推荐一款名叫 Just Perfection 的 GNOME 扩展，它帮助你一次性修改桌面的多种设置。

Just Perfection，一款全能扩展 🌟



如果 Just Perfection 扩展的名称是 “Do it all” 或许会更符合其特性。我在后续的功能介绍中会更详细地解释此扩展的用途。

通过使用这个扩展，你可以进行诸如设置 停靠区Dock、通知面板、图标，以及调整与 GNOME 交互方式等一系列的微调。

Just Perfection 这款工具有以下一些核心特性：


提供 4 个预设的用户配置文件

可以启用/禁用 super 键、动画、面板、时钟、日历等功能

可以启用/禁用应用菜单、面板通知、电源图标及活动状态的图标显示

可以个性化调整面板、通知栏、OSD 位置（音量/亮度弹出）、窗口尺寸，以及在按下 Alt + Tab 时的应用程序预览

可以调整工作空间预览的行为、是否展示工作空间切换器、应用网格的打开方式等等


这些功能听起来确实令人期待，对吗？

Just Perfection 的安装方法

Linux 上安装 GNOME 扩展有 多种途径。其中一个是通过网页浏览器来进行安装。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This is a Python package that allows you to write function signatures to define LLM queries. This makes it easy to mix regular code with calls to LLMs, which enables you to use the LLM for its creativity and reasoning while also enforcing structure/logic as necessary. LLM output is parsed for you according to the return type annotation of the function, including complex return types such as streaming an array of structured objects.
I built this to show that we can think about using LLMs more fluidly than just chains and chats, i.e. more interchangeably with regular code, and to make it easy to do that.
Please let me know what you think! Contributions welcome.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[9月26日晚，香港联交所网站信息显示，菜鸟已正式向港交所提交上市申请，成为阿里巴巴“1+6+N”之后首个正式进入IPO进程的业务集团，联席保荐人为花旗、中信证券和摩根大通。今日下午，阿里巴巴公告拟分拆菜鸟赴港上市。


菜鸟成立于2013年，并于2015年5月20日在开曼群岛注册成立获豁免有限公司，主要业务包括国际物流、国内物流与科技及其他服务。


招股申请书显示，凭借独特的“电商和科技”基因，菜鸟通过持续的创新重新定义了物流行业标准，在多个业务领域都做到了行业领先。公司已经从最初的技术平台成长为一张全球智能物流网络，在战略位置上直接建设和运营一批关键性设施，包括两个综合电商物流枢纽（e-Hub）、1100多个总面积约1650万平方米的仓库，并在全球有380多个物流分拨中心和17万个驿站。其中，直接用于跨境物流的仓库面积就达约300万平方米，为全球第一。


2023财年，菜鸟的总收入为778亿元，近三年的年均复合增长率达到21%。菜鸟的盈利能力也在持续增强，2023财年经调整EBITDA 超过了28亿元。2021财年、2022财年、2023财年，以及截至2023年6月30日止三个月，来自最大客户阿里巴巴集团的收入分别占菜鸟各期间总收入的29.2%、30.8%、 28.2%及29.7%。

给世界带来第一人称射击游戏《DOOM》的传奇软件开发者 约翰·卡马克John Carmack 在一次访谈中说，人工智能之所以能发展到今天，可能要归功于他的开创性游戏《雷神之锤》，因为它引发了对 GPU 的需求。他认为英伟达的黄仁勋认识到了 GPU 处理其他计算任务的潜力，从而引发了当前的人工智能热潮，但他仍为自己的贡献感到自豪。此外，他认为，通用人工智能artificial general intelligence（AGI）很可能在 2030 年左右与公众见面，他成立了一家研究 AGI 的初创公司 Keen。

老王点评：所以说，游戏拯救世界。不过要是按这个意义说，以太坊这种需要 GPU 的区块链也是人工智能的重要推手啊。




倡议 Apache 基金会结束 Apache Open Office

有开发者号召社区向 Apache 基金会写信，敦促他们将 Apache Open Office 项目归档。在 2014 年之后，被捐赠给 Apache 基金会的 Open Office 就没有任何实质更新。偶尔能看到有一些错误修复和字典更新。虽然看起来它的代码库还有变化，但是你会发现这些提交大多是为代码添加一些空行（或许是为了让代码好看一些？）。为防止你不会写，他还给出了一份敦促 Apache 基金会的参考邮件。


消息来源：Rocket 9 Labs



老王点评：Open Office 简直就是 Apache 基金会的笑话。




入侵索尼的勒索软件组织称自己严格遵守 GDPR 运营

这个名为 Ransomed.vc 的组织在网上宣称已经成功入侵了索尼的所有系统，并称由于索尼不想支付赎金，它将会出售数据。该组织已经发布了一些黑客证据数据，尽管这些数据“从表面上看并不是特别有说服力”。据说，Ransomed.vc 既是勒索软件运营商，也是勒索软件即服务组织。它声称自己是 “解决公司内部数据安全漏洞的安全解决方案”，并 “严格遵守 GDPR 和数据隐私法” 运营。该组织称：“如果没有收到付款，我们有义务向 GDPR 机构报告违反《数据隐私法》的行为。”

孙武

《孙子兵法》的第一个西文译本是法文本。译者是一位法国耶稣会传教士，名叫钱德明（Joseph-Marie Amiot），他受法国国王路易十五的国务大臣委托来中国收集情报。他生于1718年，1750年来华，1793年在北京去世。钱德明的译本，是《武经七书》全译，不光译《孙子兵法》。1772年，钱德明的译本在巴黎出版。据说这个版本是拿破仑的最爱。钱德明将《孙子兵法》翻译成《中国的军事艺术》（Art Militaire des Chinois），他将“兵”理解成“军事”，因而将“兵者，国之大事”翻译成“军队是国家的大事”（Les t…]]></summary>

1940年月10月12日，在毗邻皇居的东京会馆，“大政翼赞会”正式揭牌。所谓“大政”便指国政，所谓“翼赞”自然就是襄赞、辅助之意。该组织名义上是超党派的公共结社组织，实际上则是一个极右翼的法西斯组织。
1932年“五一五事件”中，时任首相、立宪政友会总裁犬养毅死于激进派军人的暗杀，宣告了1918年以来日本国内的政党内阁体制已在事实上被终结。而1936年的另一起军事政变即“二二六事件”则彻底宣告了“大正德谟克拉西”留下的痕迹彻底被军国主义的幽暗所吞噬。
1937年后，由于陷入侵华战争泥潭而无法自拔，要求建立所谓“举国一致”的新体制在日本国内迅速成为一股主导社会舆论的思潮。这股思潮在政治上的直接表现就是要求“解散政党”“取缔政党政治”，主张模仿当时的德国、意大利建立法西斯独裁体制，将全部国力毫无保留地投入侵略战争。1940年7月，近卫文麿再次组阁后，“解散政党”等主张正式被付诸实施。当时日本国会内，无论是最老牌的立宪政友会、一度主张议会中心的立宪民政党，还是被视为军部势力代言人的国民同盟，又或是走所谓基层路线的社会大众党，相继宣布自行解散，其成员大多加入了随后不久成立的“大政翼赞会”。时任首相近卫文麿兼任大政翼赞会总裁，之后的东条英机、小矶国昭以及铃木贯太郎也都兼任过总裁。
通过吸收之前国会内的政治势力，大政翼赞会在形式上实现了所谓“举国一致”的新体制。在此后，以大政翼赞会为中心来动员、支持对外侵略战争的政治体制，也被称为“翼赞体制”。自大政翼赞会成立后，“翼赞体制”便开始全方位地影响日本社会的方方面面，除配合侵略战争的政治运作外，法西斯文化宣传也是其最重要的任务之一。“翼赞文学”“翼赞报道”“翼赞歌曲”“翼赞戏剧”等概念纷纷出炉，甚至还有…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[《孙子兵法》在英语中长期以来都被翻译成“战争的艺术”（The Art of War），这个译名及其内容的翻译一直引导着读者朝战争方向去理解。如何理解兵及其法对我们进行解读和翻译都起着极为重要的作用。郭化若是将“兵”理解成“兵器”和“用兵”的。在《孙子兵法译注》（郭化若，上海古籍出版社，2012）中，郭化若将《孙子兵法》的第一句“兵者，国之大事”解读成“兵，兵器，用兵，也就是现在所说的战争。孙子一开头就对战争的主要方面和关系之重大作了总的叙述，首先指出战争是国家的大事。战争是敌我拼搏生死场所，是将决定国家存在或灭亡的途径”。魏汝霖《孙子今注今译》（台湾商务印书馆）在解读“兵”字一词时指出“兵”有很多意思，此处指的是“战争”“兵事”，也可指“国防”。但是据李零统计，“《孙子》有71个‘兵’字，‘兵’当‘武器’讲，一条没有，绝大多数都应翻成‘军队’或军力，只有少数几条，比如下文的‘兵者，诡道也’，还有后面的‘兵闻拙速’、‘兵以诈立’，‘兵’字应指‘军事’或‘军事学’”（《孙子兵法》，陈曦译注，中华书局，2011年3月版）。翻译通常反映译者的文化或宗教背景。将《孙子兵法》翻译成“战争的艺术”显然是种过度发挥，也体现出译者对中国传统哲学缺乏足够的认识。

孙武

《孙子兵法》的第一个西文译本是法文本。译者是一位法国耶稣会传教士，名叫钱德明（Joseph-Marie Amiot），他受法国国王路易十五的国务大臣委托来中国收集情报。他生于1718年，1750年来华，1793年在北京去世。钱德明的译本，是《武经七书》全译，不光译《孙子兵法》。1772年，钱德明的译本在巴黎出版。据说这个版本是拿破仑的最爱。钱德明将《孙子兵法》翻译成《中国的军事艺术》（Art Militaire des Chinois），他将“兵”理解成“军事”，因而将“兵者，国之大事”翻译成“军队是国家的大事”（Les t…]]></summary>

 As far as I know the course would cover hardware side (building pc) and video and photo editing on the software side. Besides that I would have free hands to do anything with the class.
 What do you think would be good topics to cover? This is supposed to be a fun and engaging class, as it is optional for the kids.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Doxygen 是一款广泛使用的开源文档生成工具，它通过代码注释来生成文档。


在试着熟悉别人的代码时，你总希望他们留下的代码注释能对你理解代码有所帮助。同理，无论为了自己还是其他人，编写代码时写注释是好习惯。所有编程语言都有专门的注释语法，注释可以是一个单词、一行文字、甚至是一整段话。编译器或解释器处理源代码时会忽略注释。

注释不能完全取代文档，但是有方法可以使用注释来生成文档。Doxygen 是一个开源的文档生成工具，它能够根据代码注释生成 HTML 或 LaTeX 格式的文档。Doxygen 让你在不用额外操作的情况下创建代码结构概览。尽管 Doxygen 主要是用来给 C++ 生成文档的，它对其它语言同样适用，比如 C、Objective-C、 C#、 PHP、Java 和 Python 等。

要使用 Doxygen，你只需要在源代码中使用 Doxygen 能够识别的语法来写注释。Doxygen 会扫描源码文件，然后根据这些特殊注释生成 HTML 或 LaTeX 文档。下面的示例项目会演示如何使用 Doxygen 注释，以及文档是如通过注释生成出来的。示例代码可从 GitHub 上获得，本文中也将引用 Doxygen 手册及文档 的相关章节。

在 Linux 上安装 Doxygen

在 Fedora 上可以通过软件包的形式安装 Doxygen。打开终端运行命令：

sudo dnf install doxygen


在基于 Debian 的操作系统上，可以通过以下命令来安装：

sudo apt-get install doxygen


使用

安装完 Doxygen 后，你需要在项目中按 Doxygen 可以识别的格式来注释代码，还要提供一个 Doxyfile 配置文件来控制 Doxygen 的一些行为。

"free, cross-platform, easy-to-use electronic design automation suite to draw schematics and design printed circuit boards".    
As noted in a blog post back in May, a grant has helped spur development of the tool.  
The focus for the release has been in adding features that were needed so that "there should be no show stopper anymore which prevents you from using LibrePCB for more complex PCB [printed circuit board] designs".  
New features include a 3D viewer and export format for working with designs in a mechanical computer aided design (CAD) tool, support for manufacturer part number (MFN) management, and lots of board editor features such as 
thermal relief pads in planes, blind & buried vias,
keepout zones, and more. [Thanks to Alphonse Ogulla.]]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The reason I ask is that probably getting a deal with a computer vendor is not that easy, especially with Microsoft pretty much monopolizing the pre-built market. Besides, a huge chunk of use Linux users build our own PCs, so even though it is quite simple for many to create a live USB, it would be even easier for a first-time builder to just assemble everything and just boot, right?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ditch The Bell is a desktop notifier for RSS/Atom feeds that lets you closely configure features of the freedesktop notification specification to unlock the most customizable feed notification experience possible on Linux.
I developed this program because I wanted a single, centralized location to easily manage my desktop notifications for all of the various websites I want to get updates from. Before creating this application, I found existing solutions unsatisfactory due to the following reasons:
- Built-In Notification Services: Some websites offer built-in desktop notification services, but these often require an account, staying signed in, and running a browser service worker continuously on your PC.
- RSS Readers: While existing RSS readers with notification support provide a simple solution, these project balance numerous aspects of reader development. Notifications and their configurations are usually not the priority in these projects.
- Custom Scripting: Implementing custom scripts using general-purpose notification tools like notify-send or GObject-Introspection is viable but becomes a maintenance headache as more granular control is introduced.
These alternatives are sufficient for basic notifications but lack the lightweight nature and advanced configurability that power users desire. Ditch The Bell fills this gap, offering granular control over your RSS feed notifications without the limitations of the approaches mentioned above.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am happy to announce my minimalist zero-dependency web framework, Minum, is out of beta.
http://github.com/byronka/minum
You will be hard-pressed to find another modern project as obsessively minimalistic.  Other frameworks will claim simplicity and minimalism and then, casually, mention they are built on a multitude of libraries. This follows self-imposed constraints, predicated on a belief that smaller and lighter is long-term better.
Caveat emptor: This is a project by and for developers who know and like programming (rather than, let us say, configuring).  It is written in Java, and presumes familiarity with the HTTP/HTML paradigm.
Driving paradigms of this project:
* ease of use
* maintainability / sustainability
* simplicity
* performance
* good documentation
* good testing
It requires Java 21, for its virtual threads (Project Loom)

 The goal of this program is to provide a graphical interface to handle user made power profiles, which can be useful for devices that don't support official power devil profiles (basically all devices that don't have CPC tables, which is quite common for ryzen laptops before the 5000 series, for example).
 You can also use it for devices that have already existing power profiles that you want to manually edit, as this program can do everything you could do with a bash script as root.

Qwen-14B 是一款支持多种语言的高性能开源模型，相比同类模型使用了更多的高质量数据，整体训练数据超过 3 万亿 Token，使得模型具备更强大的推理、认知、规划和记忆能力。Qwen-14B 最大支持 8k 的上下文窗口长度。



图 1：Qwen-14B 在十二个权威测评中全方位超越同规模 SOTA 大模型

Qwen-14B-Chat 是在基座模型上经过精细 SFT 得到的对话模型。借助基座模型强大性能，Qwen-14B-Chat 生成内容的准确度大幅提升，也更符合人类偏好，内容创作上的想象力和丰富度也有显著扩展。

Qwen 拥有出色的工具调用能力，能让开发者更快地构建基于 Qwen 的 Agent（智能体）。开发者可用简单指令教会 Qwen 使用复杂工具，比如使用 Code Interpreter 工具执行 Python 代码以进行复杂的数学计算、数据分析、图表绘制等；还能开发具有多文档问答、长文写作等能力的“高级数字助理”。

百亿以内参数级别大语言模型是目前开发者进行应用开发和迭代的主流选择， Qwen-14B 进一步提高了小尺寸模型的性能上限，从众多同尺寸模型中冲出重围，在 MMLU、C-Eval、GSM8K、MATH、GaoKao-Bench 等 12 个权威测评中取得最优成绩，超越所有测评中的 SOTA（State-Of-The-Art）大模型，也全面超越 Llama-2-13B，比起 Llama 2 的 3…]]></summary>

Netflix 成立于 1997 年，最初的主业就是以邮寄方式出租 DVD 和蓝光碟片。在高峰期，它每周处理 120 万张 DVD，雇佣了 50 名员工。如今它只剩下 6 名员工筛选 DVD 碟片，而这一切也将在周五结束，停止邮寄其标志性的红色包裹。在鼎盛期，Netflix 是邮政服务的第五大客户，经营着 58 家邮寄设施，128 个运输车队，能为其 98.5% 的客户提供一日送达服务。这项业务仍然有 100 万客户，为了缓和忠诚客户的强烈反应，Netflix 允许客户保留最后租借的碟片。

老王点评：一个时代的结束象征。你有多久没有看过 DVD 碟片了？




英特尔因付费阻止 AMD 进入市场而被罚 4 亿美元

2009 年，欧盟就英特尔的反垄断行为开出了创纪录的 11.3 亿美元罚款。虽然英特尔的隐藏回扣等行为因缺乏伤害证据而在上诉中驳回，但欧盟委员会维持了英特尔向 PC 厂商付费以推迟或限制产品使用 AMD 处理器的指控，对其罚款 4 亿美元。具体而言，欧盟委员会举例说明，2002 年到 2005 年，英特尔向惠普付费要求其不要通过直销渠道向中小企业提供采用 AMD CPU 的电脑；英特尔付费给联想公司，要求其将 AMD 笔记本电脑的推出时间推迟六个月。英特尔没有对这一裁决提出异议，而欧盟委员会已经对被驳回的回扣部分提起了上诉。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[9月24日，据一名微博网友（用户2406409341）爆料，一个承德的程序员，因为翻墙在github上远程工作，在外网回答用户问题，并使用zoom进行远程办公。承德市公安局对其进行了少量罚款，然而没收了其“非法所得”高达105万元，此事引发网络热议。


根据该网友陈述的事件的大致过程是：



2022年9月，当地安全部门找到我，他们认为一个发布了大量xxxx言论的推特号属于我。我表示目前正在为境外某公司工作，个人的推特只是偶尔为公司的推文点赞转发，发表xxxx的推特不属于我，同时向他们介绍了工作的情况，并展示了个人推特账号的信息。他们当天扣押了我的手机，笔记本和几块电脑硬盘。大概一个月左右归还了这些设备。


今年4月和7月又做了几次笔录，详细介绍了工作情况，并提供了收款的银行卡，公司在所在国的注册信息，我和公司签署的顾问合同等等证明文件，期间公安部门表示推特的事情已经查明和我无关，但是翻墙的事情要进行处罚，同时我的收入将被认定为违法所得。


今年8月正式下达了处罚决定：翻墙违法，翻墙之后的收入即是违法所得。


今年9月5号，我申请了行政复议，经过和复议部门的沟通，他们基本认同公安机关的意见，后续我需到法院进行行政诉讼。


期间我多次表示github.com和公司的售后支持网站不需要翻墙就可以访问，编写代码在本地电脑上完成也不需要翻墙，但这些解释没有被采纳。



目前该微博用户的信息已经被清空。


针对承德程序员事件，胡锡进认为：承德将一个程序员的境外工作收入定性为“非法收入”，并且全部没收，这是迄今我们看到的对“翻墙”最重的经济处罚。如果被处罚者去外网仅仅是编写软件，不涉及政治问题，那么这个处罚就颇为值得商榷，它开的这个“先例”增加了社会的疑惑，不利于中国扩大对外开放。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[《汉魏六朝文人身份的变迁与文学演进》，徐俪成著，上海人民出版社2023年2月出版，449页，128.00元

在近世传统中，“士人善于写作”乃是妇孺皆知之事。在从宋到清的儿童启蒙读物《三字经》中即有“唐刘晏，方七岁。举神童，作正字”，是言刘晏幼时因上《东封书》而被授予正字之职，以此为童子楷模；《儒林外史》中身处闺阁之中的鲁小姐检验夫君是否为名士的方式是“请教一篇文字”。虽然涉及的文类不同，但均显示了写作能力是维系士人身份的重要因素。但这个观念并非自古有之，从汉魏虽“士有百行”仍“以德为首”，宋初范晔对甥侄言“常耻作文士”，到齐初宰相王俭则因庾杲之“学涉文义”目之为“我辈人”，萧梁王筠以家族“人人有集”为荣，可见主流观念中对于士人身份认知的巨大转变发生在汉魏六朝间。华东师范大学徐俪成老师的新作《汉魏六朝文人身份的变迁与文学演进》即是通过梳理这一时期文人身份的变迁来论述文学才能对于士人身份认同意义的变化，尤其注重对文人社会身份与政治角色的考量。在此基础上，也对文人身份变迁影响下汉魏六朝文学风格、文类、理论的演进有所分析，为讨论汉魏六朝文学的变迁提供了新的视角。
从点缀到标志：“文”之于士人的意义
本书写作的一条重要线索即是文学之于士人意义的变化。作者在绪论中就通过对比蔡邕和柳宗元对“以文取士”态度的不同来说明汉唐之间士人眼中的文章“从陶冶性情的消遣一跃而成为取得精英身份和政治地位的重要手段”（第2页）。而之后的内容则更为细致地梳理了不同时期文学在士人社会身份和政治角色的实现过程中所起的作用，大体可以分为三个阶段：第一阶段是汉魏时期，本书的第一章认为这一时期文人的写作活动大多是围绕着君主喜好、朝廷需要所展开的，因此虽然他们的身份在俳优、颂者、文吏、儒生之间变化升降，但其地位的获得终究还是要依靠君主、权贵的赏识，而君主、权贵是不必善于写作的，因此文学写作更多是作为工具与能力的展现，…]]></summary>

当你查看数据表或软件下载页面时是否被 ARM、AArch64、x86_64、i386 等术语混淆？这些被称为 CPU 架构，我会帮你深入了解这个计算话题。

以下的表将为你总结每个字符串所代表的意义：

x86_64 /x86/amd64
64 位 AMD/英特尔 CPU 的别称


AArch64 /arm64/ARMv8/ARMv9
64 位 ARM CPU 的别称


i386

从左到右是使用该术语来描述 CPU 架构超过其右侧其他可选用术语的偏好。

从左到右是使用该术语描述 CPU 架构的优先级，使用左侧的而不是其右侧的其他可供选择的术语。

如果你像我一样是个极客，并想要更深入地解释，请继续阅读！

概述：CPU 架构

通常来说，我之前列出的术语是描述 CPU 架构的。但严格讲，它们被计算机工程师视为 CPU 的 指令集架构Instruction Set Architecture（ISA）。

CPU 的指令集架构定义了 CPU 如何解析二进制代码中的 1 和 0。

这些 CPU 的 ISA 有几个主要的类别：


x86（AMD/英特尔）

ARM

RISC-V

PowerPC（IBM 仍在使用）

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi. Couple of months ago I had really big problems with hard freezes, stuttering and crashes on my system. This also corrupted one of my NTFS drives, which had important data on it. I was moving a large amount of files to my other hard drive and this crash occured just when I was copying my stuff over. Thankfully I had backup disk I used to get my data back. I was wondering why this kept happening, and I did some research on this matter.
 I did notice that Ryzen prosessors have this fTPM stuttering bug which could in some cases freeze and crash the whole computer. My computer was unresponding and I had to hard-reset my computer. I heard that the fix has now arrived to kernel 6.5, but I'm still not sure if this fix has been applied to Linux kernel 6.2 and newer/older stable versions (I use Kubuntu 23.04). I want to be 100% sure that this same corruption will not happen again, because I need to mirror another disk using this same computer I have Kubuntu installed. 
 So can I now safely copy my stuff to my external hard drive or should I just wait until Kubuntu 23.10 releases with kernel version 6.5? That atleast should have the patch included for this bug.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This is just a small thing I coded to help me see my entire convo history in beautiful markdown, in Obsidian (my note-taking app).
[Link to Github repo](https://github.com/mohamed-chs/chatgpt-history-export-to-md).
The Python script helps you to convert conversations extracted from ChatGPT (ZIP export all your data, sent by Openai) into neatly formatted Markdown files.
Also adds YAML metadata headers and includes Code interpreter (Advanced data analysis) intput / output code.
Feel free to fork the repo and implement your own improvements, I feel like there's alot more to be extracted from the data. Any feedback or contributions are welcome !
I found chrome extensions to be a bit slow and sometimes overkill for this, although I did enjoy the folder system in some of them.

        <updated>2023-09-24T16:27:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[你完全可以从虚拟机内部访问 USB 存储器。如果你使用的是 Linux 上的 VirtualBox，下面将介绍如何做到这一点。


当你插入 USB 时，你的宿主操作系统可以轻松访问它并使用其中的文件。这并不奇怪。

如果你在 Linux 上使用带有 VirtualBox 的虚拟机，那么可以付出一些努力并从虚拟机访问插入物理机的 USB。

让我逐步引导你了解如何在 VirtualBox VM 中访问 USB 磁盘。

如何在 VirtualBox VM 中访问 USB 驱动器

默认情况下，你无法使用 VirtualBox 访问 USB 驱动器，因为你必须安装扩展包管理器，此外，还有一些配置部分。

这就是我将本教程分为三个简单步骤的原因。那么让我们从第一步开始。

步骤 1：安装 VirtualBox 扩展包（在主机上）

这是本教程中最重要的一步，因为你将安装 VirtualBox 的扩展，这将使你能够在虚拟机中使用 USB 驱动器。


🚧 你应该安装与你安装的 VirtualBox 版本相同版本的扩展包。


要安装 VirtualBox 扩展包，只需访问 VirtualBox 官方下载页面，向下滚动一点，你将找到下载扩展包的选项：



下载完扩展包后，请执行 3 个简单步骤：


转到 “文件File” > “工具Tools” > “扩展包管理器Extension Pack Manager”

点击 “安装Install” 按钮

从文件管理器中选择下载的文件：




它将打开一个新的提示来安装扩展包，你所要做的就是点击“安装”按钮并接受条款和条件：



我们就完成了扩展包的安装。

步骤 2：将用户添加到 vboxusers 组（在宿主机上）

要在 VirtualBox 中使用 USB 驱动器，你的当前用户需要位于 vboxusers 组中。

我知道这听起来有点复杂，但 将用户添加到组 是一个命令过程，将用户添加到 vboxusers 组可以通过以下方式完成：

sudo usermod -aG vboxusers $USER


完成这两个步骤后，重启系统以使这些步骤生效。

步骤 3：将 USB 驱动器添加到虚拟机


🚧 在为特定虚拟机添加 USB 之前，请确保其已关闭（未保存），否则你将无法按照给定的说明进行操作。


要为虚拟机添加 USB，你必须遵循以下简单步骤：


选择你想要使用 USB 的虚拟机并点击 “设置Settings”

转到 “USB” 选项卡

选中 “启用 USB 控制器Enable USB Controller” 框并单击 “+” 按钮选择 “USB”：




这就好了！现在你可以启动虚拟机，并且 USB 驱动器应该出现在文件管理器中。就我而言，它是 Ubuntu，所以它看起来像这样：



更多 USB 和 VM 技巧

如果你在虚拟机中使用 USB 看起来很酷，那么在虚拟机中从 USB 启动就更酷了！这里有一个关于 如何在 VirtualBox 中从 USB 驱动器启动 的详细指南：


如何在 VirtualBox 中从 USB 驱动器启动


我希望本指南对你有所帮助。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[英特尔 CTO 建议使用 AI 将 CUDA 代码移植到英特尔芯片

英特尔、AMD 和其他加速器制造商在推动采用其人工智能硬件时面临的挑战之一是，为英伟达的 CUDA 运行时编写的大量代码必须经过重构才能在其他平台上使用。SYCL 是英特尔打破 CUDA 对人工智能软件生态系统束缚的最新举措之一。SYCL 处理了将 CUDA 代码移植到可在非英伟达加速器上运行的格式的大部分繁重工作（据称高达 95%），但通常还需要进行一些微调和调整。英特尔 CTO 认为，LLM 模型可以进一步自动化这种微调。他建议，“让我们使用 LLM 和 Copilot 等技术来训练一个机器学习模型，将你所有的 CUDA 代码转换为 SYCL”。


消息来源：The Register



老王点评：用人工智能解决人工智能需要的问题，这真是一个好主意。就是不知道英伟达怎么想。




2017 年以来近 500 个智能手机品牌退出市场

报告显示，在 2017 年的高峰期，有 700 多个智能手机品牌提供了 15 亿部的年销量。2023 年，手机品牌数量将减少三分之一，降至近 250 个。过去五年中关闭的品牌几乎都是印度、中东、非洲、中国、日本和韩国等地的本土品牌。但三星等全球品牌的数量一直保持在 30 个以上。


消息来源：Tech Spot



老王点评：这些消失的手机都是安卓手机，同质化严重的手机必然会逐渐被淘汰。




加州利用人工智能提前发现 40% 的野火

加州消防局与加州大学圣迭戈分校的 “警报加州” 项目及其遍布全州的 1000 多个摄像头网络合作，正在使用这项技术及早发现火灾。该试点项目非常成功，加州消防局表示，自 7 月 10 日以来，已有 40% 的火灾在接到 911 报警电话之前被人工智能检测到，而且该技术还在不断学习和改进。


消息来源：CNN



老王点评：“你在新闻中没有听到火灾就是最大的成功。”]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[王三义  (章静 绘）

晚清知识分子曾以奥斯曼帝国为文明镜鉴，如康有为在《进呈〈突厥削弱记〉序》开篇即言：“横览万国，与中国至近形似，比拟同类，鉴戒最切者莫如突厥矣。”这里的“突厥”指的便是奥斯曼帝国。但时至今日，奥斯曼帝国复杂且缺乏连贯性的政治制度对于大多数人而言仍是雾里看花，在研究领域亦有诸多空白。
上海大学历史学系教授王三义多年来致力于中东近代经济史和奥斯曼帝国史研究，出版有《工业文明的挑战与中东近代经济的转型》（中国社会科学出版社，2006）、《英国在中东的委任统治研究》（世界知识出版社，2008）、《晚期奥斯曼帝国研究（1792-1918）》（中国社会科学出版社，2015）、《帝国之衰 ：奥斯曼帝国史六论》（社会科学文献出版社，2018）等专著。
王三义教授新著《帝国之治：奥斯曼帝国的政治制度》（上海人民出版社，2023）探讨奥斯曼帝国的政治基础和政治变迁特征，揭示了从苏莱曼大帝当政到帝国瓦解这一历史进程中政治制度的兴衰轮替。在土耳其共和国建国一百周年之际，《上海书评》采访了王三义教授，请他从历史出发，谈谈现代土耳其所继承的奥斯曼帝国。

《帝国之治：奥斯曼帝国的政治制度》，王三义著，上海人民出版社2023年5月出版，426页，65.00元

从1299年奥斯曼国家建立，到1922年帝制废除，奥斯曼帝国国祚延续六百多年，它在政治制度设计上有哪些成功之处？   
王三义：我们对奥斯曼帝国的了解，往往是先知道这个帝国的“衰”和“亡”，尤其巴尔干危机、土耳其革命等，再深入一步，才会把攻占君士坦丁堡、苏莱曼立法这些事件联系起来，追溯到帝国早期历史。如果能看完整本的奥斯曼帝国通史，一定会惊叹这个帝国的韧性，产生和你一样的疑问。
奥斯曼帝国能在较长时期内保持相对稳定，延续数百年，分明有它的特殊性。至少，奥斯曼统治者对境内诸多民族和教派的统治和管理是有效的。其实，从历史资料看…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am on EndevaourOS + KDE Plasma. I'd like to use the power profile slider in the battery plasmoid to manage the energy consumption/performace of my (amd) laptop in combo with the recent amd-pstate drivers.
 I read on the documentation of power-profile-deamon, that it should support the AMD P-State scaling driver, but it says that it will use it only if ALL these three conditions apply
  
platform_profile driver isn't available for the system
 the CPU supports Collaborative Processor Performance Control (CPPC), and
 the AMD P-State scaling driver is in active mode.
  
I am ok with point 2 (I have Ryzen 7 7735HS) and point 3 (I added the kernel parameter amd_pstate=active and now /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu0/cpufreq/scaling_driver contains amd-pstate-epp)
 How do I fix point 1 and tell it to use the pstate driver?
 ​
 Apparently I have this platform_profile driver available and working. Indeed
 >> powerprofilesctl list performance: Driver: platform_profile Degraded: no * balanced: Driver: platform_profile power-saver: Driver: platform_profile 
 doesn't show the pstate driver
 ​
 EDIT: It was also pointed out here

 The Github repo here 
 https://github.com/glanois/abcde
 has seen somewhat more recent development, including a fairly important bugfix for an issue that causes abcde to fail on single-track CDs with the default settings:
 https://github.com/glanois/abcde/pull/4
 However, this repo is set up as a simple mirror of the (apparently canonical) repository at:
 https://git.einval.com/git/abcde.git
 But this is just a link to a git repo with nothing to browse. Poking around on the einval.com site, I can see some recent blog updates from a guy who appears to be the author of abcde, but no mention of abcde itself, which leads me to think it may be abandonware.
 Anyone know what's up?

We know life can be busy. And we often struggle to make time for the people that matter most to us.
According to a Harvard study from 2021, "36% of all Americans [...] feel “serious loneliness.”" [1]
We created an app to help people focus on their most personal relationships and guide them through forming more meaningful connections with them, in the hopes to combat the "Loneliness Epidemic".
We just launched the first iteration - call it an MVP if you like - something to validate our ideas and get the conversation started.
We are looking for people to try out what we have built and share their thoughts. The functionality is very basic for now, but we are planning to expand based on our users' feedback.
Here is what you can do today:
* Tell us who the people are that matter most to you
* Get daily reminders to reach out to them
* Send them virtual postcards with over 50 handcrafted designs

Shared virtual social spaces, with a persistent object oriented authoring / scripting language. They can be classified as MUDs (depending on who you talk to) but the focus is social, creative / authoring, and shared programming not RPG gaming.
I've always wanted to see this kind of thing modernized and further developed. Over the last 25 years or so I've worked on similar but novel & improved things, but never finished.
So I decided to just re-implement LambdaMOO and use that as a base, instead and keep compatibility as a goal, but build it out on a more modern foundation that takes advantage of multiple core machines, newer network protocols, newer connectivity methods, uses MVCC transactions for the shared database etc.
LambdaMOO is a somewhat extensive system in that it is composed of compiler, a virtual machine, an object database, user permissions system, network runtime. In some ways it's kind of like a shared, text-based Smalltalk image/runtime... So quite a bit to implement and get right before it all works together.
The big challenge throughout has been slavishly maintaining backwards compatibility so existing "cores" (databases) work.
It's not done, but it's darn close. Would like for people who are into this kind of thing to check it out, and maybe even help.
Many of the technical aspects here are still provisional, but this is the start. Constructive assistance welcome.
(Yes, it's a rewrite in Rust, but that's not really the point, even though that's a cliche that's fun.)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Wayland Color Management protocol has been years in the making and is needed for a client to specify the color space and HDR metadata of a surface. This color management protocol is ultimately needed for getting high dynamic range (HDR) support working out well within Wayland environments. This week an initial merge request was opened for implementing the draft color management protocol with the Weston reference compositor. 
 The Wayland color management protocol has been years in the making and the current work-in-progress protocol for staging can be found via this open merge request, which itself is three years old. 
 New this week is developer Leandro Ribeiro posting a Weston merge request for implementing a majority of the color management protocol spec. The lone missing piece is image_description_creator_params_v1 support, which will be followed up in a future merge request. 
 Those interested in tracking the Weston color management support can see this Weston merge request now under review. 
 Slowly but surely the Linux desktop is getting ready for finally offering good high dynamic range (HDR) support.

You may say BSD? Do you really think the crap BSD license would ever make that happen. And what about other Free Software that you run on your computer? I can confidently say, 80% of the Free Software you use would not exist today without GNU Project, GPL and FSF. 
 You guys tryna find out 100s of wrong arguments to defend calling your OS as Linux. For what? To hand over all the credits to a guy who stole the credits that GNU Project had been working for since 1980s?
 You argue that we can't call our system GNU/Linux/systemd/xorg/... That's fine but why special exception for the linux kernel? Afterall GNU were the one who set out to create the operating system. Atleast GNU isn't named on it's founder unlike your kernel.
 You argue Alpine isn't GNU. But you forget GNU/kBSD or GNU/Hurd isn't Linux.
 All your arguments for not mentioning GNU are already answered here
 Why don't I see people defending GNU instead. Why to defend that organization whose own employees do not care about freedom and were caught using Mac. 
 You say GNU is a cult. But you forget none of these would be possible without those so-called Free Software extremists. 
 If you have to be biased, why not be biased for GNU, for the sake of freedom. Instead of arguing about alternatives to coreutils and glibc why not use those and improve them to keep GNU and it's ideas alive.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[本文将详细介绍如何在 Ubuntu 和其他 Linux 发行版中转换和查看 WebP 图像，主题内容涵盖了你所需知道的全部信息。

WebP 图像格式的定义

2010 年 9 月，谷歌提出了 WebP 图像格式，其愿景是完全替代 JPEG、PNG 和 GIF 文件格式。就如你所见，WebP 是一个全能型的格式，继承了先前压缩算法的所有特性，支持有损和无损的动画以及透明度。

除此以外，WebP 基于块预测技术，它是互联网上推荐使用的图像格式。由于其文件大小明显更小、图象质量更好，WebP 已经成为了为网站提供图像的现代化标准。

现状简述

现在，几乎所有的主流 Web 浏览器都开始支持 WebP，也就是说你可以在包括 Chromium、Chrome、Firefox、Brave、Vivaldi、Safari 和 Edge 在内的热门浏览器中查看这种格式的图像。

然而，要从现有的 JPG 和 PNG 文件创建 WebP 图像，你需要安装谷歌开发的 WebP 库。另外，Linux 发行版的文件管理器暂时还不能直接显示该格式的图像。

为了与 WebP 实现无缝集成和提供良好的用户体验，各个组件必须协同工作。操作系统需要的是 WebP 的核心库。此外，文件管理器和图像查看器则需要能识别 *.webp 文件类型并进行加载。

这些为用户提供了一致的体验。由于 WebP 是新的标准，正在广泛施行和应用，你可能需要在 Linux 下执行一些额外的步骤以便运用这种技术。

另一方面，Windows 10 和 11 现在已经默认支持 WebP，包括其新的图像查看器功能。

因此，本篇文章将探讨如何在 Linux 系统下浏览、创建以及转换 WebP 图像的问题。

如何查看 WebP 图像

VSCodium 是微软 VS Code 的“完全开源版本”。

它基本上是 VS Code 的克隆，并去除了所有遥测痕迹。遥测是用于收集有关应用使用情况的数据。许多开发人员使用它来深入了解改进他们的应用。

从外观和功能来看，这两个编辑器是相同的。



在 Ubuntu 上安装 VSCodium 有三种方法：


从发布页面下载 deb 文件进行安装。缺点是你无法轻松更新它，因为你必须再次下载新的 deb 文件。

将第三方开发者仓库添加到你的系统中（VSCodium 推荐的方式）。这样，你还可以获得 VSCodium 新版本的定期更新。

使用 snap 版本。如果你不厌恶 Snap 软件包，这也许是最简单的方法。


我不会讨论第一种方法，因为它只是从 发布页面 下载并 安装 deb 文件。

我们来看看另外两种方法。

方法 1：通过添加外部仓库来安装 VSCodium

VSCodium 官方文档引用了 Pavlo Rudy 的 GitLab 仓库，它为你提供了 VSCodium 的持续更新版本。


📋 虽然我在这里使用 Ubuntu，但这些步骤应该适用于 Debian 和其他基于 Debian 和 Ubuntu 的发行版。


以下是步骤。

在 Ubuntu 中打开终端 并使用以下命令获取开发者的 GPG 签名密钥并将其添加到你的系统中。这样，你的 Ubuntu 系统将信任该开发人员签名的软件包。

DuckDuckGo CEO 说摆脱谷歌“需要很多步”

DuckDuckGo 是一家以隐私为中心的搜索引擎，成立于 2008 年，其创始人在对谷歌的反垄断审查中表示，由于谷歌是电脑上的默认选项，消费者从谷歌转向其他搜索引擎“比想象中要难得多，……需要很多步”，因此 DuckDuckGo 的市场份额一直很小。DuckDuckGo 目前在美国搜索市场的份额约为 2.5%，每天的全球搜索量约为 1 亿次。相比之下，谷歌每天的搜索量为几十亿次。

 I've been using Linux based systems for quite a while now, but I want to get into the technical stuff of how it works internally. Not necessarily aiming to be kernel dev, but I just want to know how low level stuff works under the hood.
 Some colleagues suggested to read Linux Kernel Development by Robert Love, however it seems like it's based on kernel version 2.6, and I'm a bit skeptical about this.
 Do you think that the book is still relevant today ? I suppose the fundamentals haven't changed but it won't be the most up to date read about the kernel.
 I know I could just go ham on the kernel documentation but I'm lacking knowledge that I hope this book might provide me.

1959年首次出版的《马克斯·韦伯与德国政治1890-1920》（下文将简称《韦伯与德国政治》）是韦伯研究领域公认的经典之作。鉴于钱永祥、阎克文两位前辈已为本书增添了两篇重量级导读，其中对韦伯的政治思想以及一战前后德国政治生态提纲挈领的把握，读来令人受益匪浅。也许是出于职业习惯，我对本书的关注更着眼于作者沃尔夫冈·J.蒙森对韦伯政治观点的历史考察。作为历史学家，蒙森似乎始终坚持并强调从时代出发理解韦伯的立场，他在自己编纂的韦伯全集第十五卷的导言中写道，韦伯“终其一生深度介入政治”，也“从未摆脱过日常政治对其所提出的要求”。一方面，韦伯深度介入政治的年代适逢德国政治出现重大转变并引发后续系列影响；但另一方面，青年蒙森辗转求学并以韦伯政治思想为题撰写博士论文的上世纪四五十年代，德国又进入一个新的转折时期：二战后同盟国对战败德国采取非纳粹化和民主化改造，尤其强调在西占区（及日后的联邦德国）思想领域通过推行“再教育”以西式民主思想重塑德国社会。职业与生活的经历显然影响了蒙森对韦伯的理解，并最终参与形塑了本书的主要观点。也正是文本所呈现的观念与这种特定时代氛围、作者所处的知识分子代际之间的互动，让这次阅读之旅变得高度紧张，但同时又充满趣味。
一、沃尔夫冈·J.蒙森其人
沃尔夫冈·J.蒙森的曾祖父是德国著名的古典学家、历史学家，著有《罗马史》的特奥多尔·蒙森（Theodor Mommsen），父亲威廉·蒙森（Wilhelm Mommsen）是魏玛共和国杰出的政治史学者。他的孪生兄弟汉斯·蒙森（Hans Mommsen）则是当代著名的第三帝国史学者。虽然家学渊源深厚，沃尔夫冈·蒙森却一度想要放弃延续父祖辈的事业。不过经历了在大学修读物理和数学未…]]></summary>

Ive heard somewhere that the kernel was originally called freax or something, they could just change it back to that or just change it to something else as id imagine renaming the kernel, which isnt really what most people refer to when they say the word linux, would go way smoother.. Then gnu would just remain as is, the kernel would be named whatever is decided, and linux would finally just be solidified as the name of the combination of the gnu components with the "insert new name" kernel here. I can see why some think this is dumb, and i, to some extent, agree, but i also value credit being given appropriately, especially as an rms fan lol. Edit: i forgot to aknowledge the fact that many of us already refer to our os of choice as the name of the distro rather than linux, but it could make things less intimidating or confusing for outsiders, consider the remarkable number of distros available

As for snaps, I don't care about it being implemented to Ubuntu and I'm actually curious to see how it will turn out in the long run. And obviously, when I mention distros, I am not talking about Ubuntu flavors (Kubuntu, Lubuntu, etc...) which obviously should follow Ubuntu's direction.
 Ubuntu are making big changes recently, and they've made it clear that it's only a matter of time before their entire system is snap based. On the other hand, Ubuntu-based distros such as Pop!_OS, elementary OS and such are clearly more headed towards Flatpak and would have no use of snaps to their core system. Not to mention Linux Mint that is openly unfriendly towards snaps. As lo…]]></summary>

        <updated>2023-09-22T16:36:12.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Overall, a “Device Tree” is a mechanism for describing non-discoverable hardware. In the past this type of information was hard-coded as part of the source code (and later part of the binary/firmware). So we can say a “DeviceTree” is a data structure for describing hardware. By the way, there is a specification for that called “The Devicetree Specification” (https://www.devicetree.org/specifications/).
 Moreover, “DeviceTree” allows the kernel to manage different components such as CPU, memory, buses and other. The specification detailed above contains the data format used, which is internally a tree of named nodes and properties (key-value based). Device trees can be in binary format (“*.dtb”) or text based (“*.dts”) for easing the management and editing (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Devicetree). The “*.dtb” files are loaded by the bootloader and passed to the kernel — as shown in the diagram below.
 Thus, we can find in the Linux kernel source code “*.dts” files in the directories of some of the architectures, with the following pattern “/arch/[ARCHITECTURE/boot/dts”. Two examples are “arm64” (https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v6.5.4/source/arch/arm64/boot/dts) and “nios2” (https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v6.5.4/source/arch/nios2/boot/dts). In order to transform “*.dts” files to “*.tdb” we can use the “dtc” which is the “Device Tree Compiler” (https://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/xenial/man1/dtc.1.html). We can go over Makefiles responsible for that if we want (like https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v6.5.4/source/arch/arm64/boot/dts/Makefile).
 Lastly, there are also “.dtsi” files that include files (like we have in c/c++). We can use also YAML as the format of “*.dts” files in order to describe the different hardware components (https://www.konsulko.com/yaml-and-device-tree).

Really excited to share what I've been working on. Rapidpages is a prompt-first online IDE, think midjourney for front-end developers. I've been working on this for a while and it's great to see some interest from companies like Vercel in this space.
All you need for self-hosting is an OpenAI key and a GitHub oauth app. Simply clone the repo and play with it. It's also available on the cloud at www.rapidpages.io
Please give it a try and let me know if you have any feedback, and if you like what I'm doing with Rapidpages, please give it a star on GitHub.
Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[我们将介绍几款可在 Linux 系统中使用的白板应用程序。我相信，这些信息对你将大有帮助。请继续阅读！


一般而言，数字白板是一种大型互动显示面板的工具。比如：平板、大屏手机、触控笔记本和表面显示设备等，就是一些常见的白板设备类型。

假设教师使用了白板，你就可以使用触控笔、手写笔、手指甚至鼠标在设备屏幕上进行绘画、书写或操作元素。这意味着，你可以在白板上进行拖动、点击、删除和绘画，就如同用笔在纸上一样。

但是，要做到这一切，就需要一款软件来支持这些功能，即实现触控和显示之间的精细协调。

现在的市面上，有很多商业应用都能完成这项工作。然而，在这篇文章中，我们将会重点介绍一些自由且开源的、并且可在 Linux 系统中运行的白板应用程序。

Linux 系统白板应用程序佳选

1、Xournal++

在我们的推荐名单上，第一个就是 Xournal++。我认为，这是此列表中最好的应用程序。它十分稳定，而且已经存在了一段时间。

Xournal++ 允许你进行书写、绘画，以及其他常见的在纸上进行的各种事情。它支持手写、自定义荧光笔、橡皮擦等工具。此外，它还有其他诸多功能，例如：支持图层，支持添加外部图像，支持添加音频，具有多页特性等。

该应用程序兼容几乎所有的压敏输入设备，例如 Wacom、Huion 和 XP-Pen。我曾在触摸板笔记本上进行过测试，经过少量设置修改后，它就可以正常工作了。因此，你可以开始使用任何你手头上的触控设备。

Xournal++ 是使用 C++ 和 GTK3 进行编写的。



对于 Linux 系统，你可以按下述步骤进行安装。此程序是完全免费的，且适用于 Linux、macOS 和 Windows 系统。如果你想在移动设备上尝试，也提供了 BETA 版本。

安装步骤：

该应用程序可以通过 AppImage、S…]]></summary>

 But what about an average daily user ?
 One OS for them as well.
 It can start as small project nothing much, just for fun, done in free time.
 We both know current linux is not ready for an average daily user.
 It can be a distro. But smooth, appealing, stable, less terminal.
 Yeah that's opposite of what linux people like but 
 meh fuck it

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[港股公司鲁大师宣派特别股息后又取消，被市场解读为大股东减持的“幌子”。电影里都没有的剧情，竟然在2023年的港股上演了。


9月11日晚，鲁大师在港交所发布公告，预计将在下周召开董事会审议派发特别股息的议案。不过公告并没有公布具体将派发多少特别股息。在市场低迷的情况下，鲁大师宣派特别股息的提案出人意料，公司股价随后也接连大涨，9月12日便大涨50%，随后持续上涨，至9月19日累计涨近70%。


但9月20日，公司股价大跌近50%。21日，鲁大师公告称，控股股东之一诚盛有限公司于9月20日减持了3434.3万股。按照当日收盘价1港元/股估算，减持金额至少有3434.3万港元。与此同时，公司还公告称，取消审议特别股息的董事会会议。


减持本无可厚非，但如果通过“制造”利好配合减持，尤其是“制造”出来的利好还是“烟雾弹”，这无疑损害了投资者的利益，也扰乱了市场秩序。


特别股息提案不翼而飞


时隔四年后，鲁大师的分红提议引起市场的关注。


鲁大师9月11日晚公告称，预计将在下周召开董事会审议派发特别股息的议案，但只是提及了分红董事会决议，并没有确定具体的分红额度。


 


在资本市场中，分红对投资者而言，可以提高回报，增强获得感。上市公司则可以更好地展现良好的业绩、彰显投资价值。上市公司分红与企业盈利能力息息相关，同样情况下，上市公司稳定分红能够增加投资者对企业的信赖和支持，从而也更容易实现股价上涨。


鲁大师在港股上市以来，首次分红是在2019年，当年正是鲁大师港股上市的第一年，公司每股派发0.1港元，合计派现2690万港元。但随后几年，鲁大师一直未派发现金股利，而从公司经营看，虽然公司业绩在疫情期间出现一定程度下滑，但总体仍处于盈利状态。


疫情后，公司业绩整体有所恢复。据公司此前公布的业绩，2022年实现营业收入3.59亿元，同比增长6.27%；归属母公司净利润6048.60万元，同比增长9.90%。2023年上半年，公司实现营业收入2.92亿元，同比增长61.5%；公司权益持有人应占期内溢利2857.30万元，同比增长21.2%。


时隔4年，公司突然宣布分红，无疑让市场意外。随后，公司股价在9月12日当天大涨50%，此后几天也持续震荡上扬，从底部以来累计涨近70%。


但在股价大涨后，公司却突然宣布取消审议派发特别股息议案的董事会会议。公司表示，经综合考虑近期公司股份价格及成交量出现不寻常波动，为了充分评估有关宣派特别股息的影响，董事会会议取消举行。


事情一经公布，不少股民加入讨论，甚至有股民拉群召集投资者向香港证监会投诉，认为鲁大师“恶意发布分红消息，唱高散货”，而“唱高散货”，一般为通过各种手段推高股价，然后利用社交媒体平台散播“内幕消息”，误导投资者买入流动性低的股票，再将股票抛售套利离场。最近，“唱高散货”成为香港证监会重点打击的行为。


大股东减持超3400万港元


在股价大涨之际，公司控股股东之一诚盛有限公司大手笔减持。


9月20日，在连续大涨后，鲁大师股价当日大跌近20%。随后，鲁大师9月21日公告称，经作出适当查询后，诚盛有限公司9月20日于公开市场自愿出售3434.3万股股份，占本公告日期已发行股份总数约12.77%。


根据大师控股有限公司与诚盛有限公司在2018年9月4日签订的公司股东权利委托协议，诚盛委托大师控股行使诚盛作为公司股东的所有权利（包括但不限于诚盛于公司股东大会上的投票权）。大师控股由执行董事田野直接全资拥有。


减持后，诚盛有限公司持有公司股份由8274.51万股（占已发行股份总数约30.76%）降低至4840.21万股（占已发行股份总数约17.99%）。


按照9月20日当天收盘价计算，诚盛有限公司此次减持金额约为3434.3万港元。若按照成交均价1.219港元/股计算，诚盛有限公司此次减持金额达到4186.41万港元。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[使用 Tagger 来标记你的音乐？ 现在，它增加了新功能和修复。


Tagger 已发布新版本，其中包含大量有用的改进！

对于那些不知道的人来说，Tagger 是一款专注于流行音乐文件类型的开源 标签编辑器应用，支持 MP3、OGG、FLAC、WAV 等音乐文件。

它可用于向音乐文件添加重要的元数据，例如专辑封面、艺术家/发行商信息、发行年份，甚至自定义属性。

让我们看看这个新版本的 Tagger 能提供什么。

🆕 Tagger V2023.9.1：有什么新变化？



Tagger 采用 C# 语言编写，它出现自 2021 年底，并且一直在定期进行改进。

在 Tagger V2023.9.1 版本中添加了多项改进。

首先，它包括了更新的翻译，要感谢 Weblate 上的用户。

然后还有新添加的功能，可以在 Tagger 中打开、管理和创建播放列表。这是为了更容易地同时处理许多音乐文件，从而“音乐文件夹Music Folder”现在被称为“音乐库Music Library”。

接下来，同步歌词时间戳现在以 “mm:ss.xx” 格式显示，遵循 LRC 规范，并且可以指定 “hh:mm:ss” 和 “mm:ss.xx” 格式，允许 Tagger 对其进行转换。

此外，Tagger 现在在排序时在音乐文件列表中显示标题，为了获得更有条理的文件视图，主窗口大小在应用重新启动时不会丢失，并且 LRC 文件现在可以正确导入。

有关更多技术细节，你可以参考其 发行说明。

📥 下载Tagger V2023.9.1

你可以通过选择可用的软件包之一来获取最新版本的 Tagger，如下所示：


Snap

Flatpak

AUR 包


对于 Ubuntu，你还可以运行以下命令来安装它：

sudo snap install tagger



💡 当我们谈论添加元数据的应用时，还有 元数据清理器。它允许你清除最流行的文件类型中的元数据，这与 Tagger 完全相反。


💬 你以前用过 Tagger 吗？ 你对此的体验如何？ 在评论区分享你的观点。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sometime ago I posted in this subreddit my rofi-desktop project, a collection of rofi menus made by simple bash and python scripts with the aim of providing the features of a complete desktop environment. 
 Since then, many things were added or changed, and I feel like it's time for an update. 
 - First of all, almost all the scripts are now fully commented and easily customizable by sourcing environment variables. Check the config.env file for a commented list of customizable stuff. Uncomment variables inside as needed and source the file somewhere in your ~/.bashrc file to customize your rofi-desktop.
 - The main script rofi-desktop.sh now supports an optional argument that can be provided to determine which entries to show in the menu, like this:
