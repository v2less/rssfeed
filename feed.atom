        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This weekend I have been a bit nostalgic for old Linux distributions. My earliest exposure to Linux was in 2003 when the MIS manager at a company I was interning at gave me 3 CDs with Redhat Linux 7.2. I never installed it until about 2004 when my dad got a way more powerful computer (Dell Dimension 8300) and ended up getting it to successfully install in VirtualPC. I should mention I did attempt to install it on my home PC at the time, a Zenith GT Workstation my mom got for me through a church donation. Either the computer was too old or I was clueless how to get it to work. I do remember the anaconda installer defaulting to a text based setup because the PC was not powerful enough to run the GUI. I think at that point I gave up.
 The same network manager gave me a CD with an early versio…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've tried calibre, okular, bookworm and foliate, with foliate providing by far the nicest experience for ebooks. But that experience is way worse than it is with a typical pdf reader. Latex doesn't render properly, scrolling is choppy, special text formatting (ie. code) doesn't really work, jumping between pages is buggy, etc. The only real advantage I can see is that with ebooks, you can make a section breakless and scrollable which is nice when reading code, whereas pdfs just split it onto multiple pages.

	There is really nothing here that makes me at all worried, except

	have slowed down more by now.

	As a result, I'm now pretty sure that this is going to be one of

 I’m retired now and looking for a simple database/web implementation to play around with some scripting. I’ve been away from Linux for about four years, have MySQL and Perl been replaced by other (just as simple) things? I don’t want a full-time job to implement, just a hobby to toy with.

 So,..(please confirm if this is indeed the case), clone system call is essentially the way for a process to spawn a thread (unlike fork for spawning a process).. and clone accepts parameters w.r.t what exactly it needs to share from the parent, virtual address space being the bare minimum. Turns out, the so-called "thread" is indeed a process in Linux. Inspection of htop, shows that even threads have PIDs. So everything is ultimately a process?

Or rather it will just boot to its console and you'll have to load the main grub.cfg yourself. To avoid this you'll need to mount your ESP read-write and reinstall the bootloader after making that change. Note: update-grub doesn't do this for you.
 I can appreciate why the Grub devs did it this way, but that behaviour was completely opposite to my expectations, considering that most distributions mount the ESP read-only by default, if at all. Anyway, I wasted yesterday evening figuring that out.

When the power is turned on, it should start up and automatically start playing the contents of a folder (or an USB stick?) using the default player (or better) in ubuntu. 
 (tried first with vlc but it was so slow that it was one frame per second. Then tried the built-in player and it did fine). Maybe mplayer will work fine? I don't know yet. 
 I am experienced with Windows but I am a complete n00b when it comes to Linux. So, please explain it like you're explaining it to a toddler. Thanks in advance for helping me :)

But there's a difference between me now and the me 2 years ago. Back then, I loved compiling every program, be as "bloat"-free as possible, did everything from the command line, thinking it was the more efficient way for everything. Now that I think about it, I don't enjoy doing that stuff anymore cuz it just takes up too much time. I now prefer to use GUI apps for almost everything. Stuff like zathura and suckless apps doesn't appeal to me now. What do you think?

Am getting into CDs again just for the fun of the nostalgia, and I discovered lightscribe is a thing and it looks pretty rad(printing images in gray-scale on the top part of the CD through the CD burner using the laser for those who don't know), but I can't find any software currently available to do it on GNU/Linux, it seems the one from LaCie is not hosted anywhere anymore, the lightscribe website is dead, not sure if it still could run on current distros anyway ...
 ​
 I only use GNU/Linux OSes and I'd like to avoid making a Windows VM just for that, is there a solution? By the way I saw Arch has packages in the AUR that would make it work it seems but am on Fedora and a DNF and flathub search for lightscribe don't return any results :/
 ​
 Can I run some CD burning program from Windows with Wine to do it maybe?
 And by the way am not sure that my computer's CD burner is compatible with lightscribe, I bought it a decade ago to put it in my self-assembled PC, I remember it didn't even came in a proper box back then, just unlabeled cardboard, only thing I know is that it's from Samsung IIRC, is there some way through software means to determine if it supports lightscribe? 
 ​
 Thanks for the help!

I want to show you MyNixOS.com - a website I've been working on this year to make it easy to create and share Nix and NixOS configurations. Nix is a powerful tool to deploy software in a reproducible way, and with NixOS you can control your whole operating system through a declarative configuration.
Starting out with Nix was exciting, but it definitely had a challenging learning curve. This made me start building a website focused on making it easier to create and share Nix flakes, which are the core unit of software deployment in Nix.
Using the website, you can create flakes without knowing the Nix configuration language, as the necessary Nix files are generated for you. A few examples of what you can do right now:

        <link href="https://linux.cn/article-15294-1.html?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss"/>
        <updated>2022-11-27T03:37:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[htop 是一个流行的命令行工具，可以帮助监测 Linux 上的系统资源和性能。

它比通常默认开箱即用的 top 好。

使用 htop，你可以对进程进行过滤和排序，以便更好地了解情况，获得正在运行的进程的树状视图，并在需要时杀死进程。



我使用 htop 而不是其他系统监控工具，因为它可以显示对我来说至关重要的东西，并允许在我需要控制运行中的服务时终止流氓进程或冻结进程。

但是，如果你想要其他显示更多信息，或一个看起来不同的东西，有哪些htop 替代品呢？让我们来看看。

1、atop



atop 可以提供所有运行的进程的细节。你可以得到你需要的所有数据，以了解你系统上的进程情况。

它还提供了对资源利用率进行永久记录的能力，以便进行长期分析。系统管理员可能会发现这比其他工具更有用。

不幸的是，它并没有为你提供漂亮的输出。因此，如果你想要的话，请继续看下面的其他替代品。

如何安装 atop？

对于基于 Ubuntu/Debian 的发行版，键入：

sudo apt install atop


2、vtop



如果你想要一个漂亮的输出和管理进程的基本功能，vtop 是一个完美的系统监控工具。

正如我在其他一些文章中所说，它的输出看起来像终端中的 GUI。你可以使用鼠标，也可以选择禁用它。也可以定制它的主题。

它是用 Node.js 构建的。所以，你需要安装额外的包来安装它。

不幸的是，这个项目似乎不再积极维护。但是，在写这篇文章的时候，它对我来说还是有用的。

如何安装 vtop？

对于基于 Ubuntu 的发行版，在终端输入以下命令：

sudo apt install nodejs
sudo apt install npm
sudo npm install -g vtop


3、btop++



btop++ 是 bashtop 和 bpytop 的一个 C++ 版本。是的，它是这些项目的第三次迭代，由同一个开发者完成。

btop++ 包括完全的鼠标支持，带有一个受游戏启发的菜单系统，可以让你过滤进程、树状视图等等。

如何安装 btop++？

使用官方软件库，你可以很容易地在 Fedora、openSUSE 和 FreeBSD 上安装它。

对于 Fedora，你可以键入：

sudo dnf install btop


你可以探索它的 GitHub 页面，了解在其他 Linux 发行版上的安装方式。

4、Glances



Glances 与 htop 类似，但有更多的功能。

它是一个跨平台的系统监控工具，可以将数据以 CSV 或其他格式导出，用于 InfluxDB、Elasticsearch 等。

你也可以利用它的网页用户界面，远程（或在不能访问终端的情况下）查看统计数据。

如何安装 Glances？

对于基于 Ubuntu 的发行版，你可以键入：

sudo apt install glances


5、nmon



nmon 是一个令人印象深刻的监测工具，它可以让你控制你想显示的输出内容。

你可以提取监测数据（以 CSV 格式导出）并用于进一步分析。它很容易切换统计数据和在不同的视图之间进行切换。

默认情况下，它每两秒刷新一次数据，但你可以自定义它，并使用更多的选项来调整你的体验。

如何安装 nmon？

你可以在官方软件库中找到它。对于基于 Ubuntu 的发行版，在终端键入以下内容：

sudo apt install nmon


总结

top 2022

top 命令工具被植入在你的 Linux 系统中。如果你想要一个基本的监控工具，想要关注系统进程和一些统计信息，top 就足够了。

我不确定它是否可以算作比 htop 更强的体验，这也是 top 没有被列入主要列表的原因。

正如你在这里看到的，一些监控工具可能很有趣，而且证明比 htop 更有洞察力。

你最喜欢的 htop 替代品是什么？你认为 htop 对你的使用情况来说已经足够了吗？欢迎在下面的评论中让我知道你的想法。

Pantheon 是 elementary OS 使用的一个漂亮的桌面环境。它基于 GTK3（GTK4 移植正在进行中）和 Vala，是一个漂亮而干净的桌面，为你提供了一个精致的 Linux 桌面体验。

该桌面主要由 elementary OS 使用。elementary OS 提供了 Pantheon 桌面的修改版，它是基于 GNOME 的。

elementary OS 基于 Ubuntu LTS 版本。因此，在基于 Ubuntu 的发行版中安装 Pantheon 桌面是超级容易的。这意味着如果你想在不安装 elementary OS 的情况下体验 Pantheon，在 Ubuntu 中这只需要一两个命令就可以安装。

在 Fedora 中，你也可以使用组包进行安装。然而，一个以 Fedora 为基础，名为 Ultramarine Linux 的发行版默认提供了它。

但是，在 Arch Linux 中安装 Pantheon 需要一些工作。它不是用简单的 pacman 命令就能直接完成的，而且不能开箱即用。需要一些配置，这可能会破坏你的系统。

这里我给你提供了在 Arch Linux 中安装 Pantheon 桌面的指南和步骤。

警告： 第一次可能不顺利，所以我建议你在物理系统上安装前先在虚拟机上进行。因为在 Arch 中安装 Pantheon 并不像在 Arch Linux 中安装 GNOME、Xfce 和 KDE Plasma 桌面那样流畅。它还需要一些额外的手动配置。

Even using an Apple computer there are ways to get installer ISOs, but not on this Dell; unreliable online disk image driver hackery only. Windows would not even launch the installer or say what driver it wanted, just that it wanted it.

 My parents are not computer literate. That translated into lots of regular issues with their Windows computers. When we made the switch to Linux, I had to show them where to click or how to navigate the GUI in a couple of cases or do some basic setup work, and field the occasional question.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[For other HN'ers out there who have personal projects on Heroku and might've forgotten (like I did), this weekend is the last chance to get data out of Heroku (or upgrade to paid plans) before it deletes databases/Redis and shuts down free dynos on Monday.
> What products are impacted by the removal of free plans?
>> `free` dynos, `hobby-dev` Heroku Postgres, and `hobby-dev` Heroku Data for Redis plans.
>> What happens if I take no action on my free apps or databases or do not upgrade to a paid plan?
>> If you take no action by November 28, 2022:
>> - `free` dynos will be converted to `eco` dynos scaled down to 0. You must subscribe to the Eco dyno hours plan or upgrade to another paid plan before you can scale them up again. Any Scheduler jobs that used free dynos will fail until they are reconfigured to use another dyno type.
> - For non-Enterprise users, `hobby-dev` databases will be deleted in accordance with the Heroku Documentation starting November 28, 2022.
> - For Enterprise users, `hobby-dev` databases that belong to an Enterprise Account or Team will be converted to `mini`. There will be no immediate change in cost to your Heroku Enterprise invoices if an app is upgraded from a free tier resource to a paid tier resource. Any changes to Heroku Enterprise pricing would require a contract update to take effect. If you have any concerns about your contract pricing, contact your account executive.
> - `hobby-dev` databases that belong to personal accounts will be deleted, and `free dynos` will be converted to `eco` dynos scaled down to 0, even if that user also belongs to an Enterprise Team. These users must upgrade to paid resources before November 28, 2022.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Western Digital latest Enterprise disks introduced a "technology" called OptiNAND. In their manual (pdf) they are not saying much about it (or at least I could not find anything) other than eg. the HC560 has 64GB flash on board, in their data sheet (pdf) I copy-pasted below what they are saying about it.
 My question if they are storing this so called "metadata" (whatever that is) on flash storage how would that affect full disk encryption security? Any concerns? Wonder how that even works if everything is encrypted on the disk. Or maybe this metadata is just a kind of "index table" of the sectors but has zero relevance of the sector content?
 For the sake of simplicity let's assume:
  
no intentional malicious code is on these HDDs' firmware
 dm-crypt full disk encryption (+LUKS)
 no known exploit in dm-crypt
 highly sensitive company data (so you are not hiding something from your girlfriend :D)
  
From their data sheet:
 "OptiNAND integrates an iNAND® Universal Flash Storage (UFS) Embedded Flash Drive (EFD) with traditional spinning disk media, and incorporates innovative changes to the firmware algorithm and system-on-a-chip (SoC). OptiNAND is not a hybrid technology*. The drive works smarter, with enhanced firmware algorithms taking advantage of* expanded metadata that has been offloaded to the iNAND*, enabling more tracks per inch (TPI), resulting in increased areal density. The Ultrastar DC HC560, with the first implementation of OptiNAND technology’s capacity-enabling features, delivers an unbeaten 20TB capacity in a nine-disk platform (2.2TB/platter) with CMR recording format."*

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Some time ago I wanted to give the aerc email client a try, but then I deleted it when I found out that it stores the password in plain text. But now I wonder, how do other applications store sensitive information like passwords? For example in KMail I only entered my password initially and the application stored it somewhere.
 The obvious solution is to store data encrypted, but how does the application decrypt it again? It would need some cryptographic key, but then we have just kicked the can down the road: the key itself needs to be either plain text or it needs to be encrypted again, which necessitates another key or a password.
 In this comment the author of aerc says that the config file must have permissions 600 (read+write for owner, nothing for rest of system), so it is not readable by the rest of the system. Is this what other applications do as well? A malicious application I have installed which has access to the file system could just read my settings and an attacker who gets physical access to my machine (e.g. a thief) could just hook up the hard drive to his computer and bypass and OS permissions. For the latter I would have to encrypt my hard drive, and for the former I guess I have to be careful what I run and not just trust "lol, the password is encrypted". Am I correct?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Folks, i'm so thankful to have come across linux by chance. Few years ago I purchased a Chromebook because I was broke and couldn't afford to replace windows laptop.
 I got tired of Chromebooks limitations so I looked around and came across crouton only few months ago. It began my journey of steep learning curve and may hours of frustrations.
 I persisted and ended up running various distros but settled on lubuntu. Works flawlessly on my Chromebook.
 I plan to buy a good laptop and install either Pop!Os or Mint.
 Biggest benefit for me - I struggle with hyperactivity and I'm easy distracted and overstimulated.
 Linux is basically like taking a ADHD medication for me - clutter free and no distratction. I love it.
 EDIT: btw watched and read about the development of GNU/Linux. Very interesting and I think Linus Torvalds is real deal.
 What tips do you have for an enthustiastic newbie?

NordPass 发布了 2022 年最常见的密码名单，排名第一的是 “password”，其次是 “123456”、“123456789”、“guest”、“qwerty” 以及更多不需要破解工具就能知道的密码。除此以外，还有很多设备的默认密码也很流行。此外，密码也经常随着流行趋势而变化，比如奥斯卡颁奖、流行电影等等。

老王点评：大多数密码的作用相当于“防君子不防小人”的纱门一样。




谷歌称互联网的六成是重复内容

谷歌工程师 Gary Illyes 在一次演讲中称，互联网上六成的内容是重复的。但他没有对重复进行定义。互联网上有大量重复内容是众所周知的事实，问题是比例有多大，作为最大最流行的搜索引擎，谷歌给出了它的答案。


消息来源：SE Roundtable



老王点评：毕竟互联网的主要内容来自 ICP —— Internet Copy & Paste。🤣




Ubuntu Touch 发布新版本，但仍基于六年前的 Ubuntu

这个可以在智能手机和平板电脑上运行的 Linux 发行版推出了最新版本 OTA-24，继续支持来自华硕、谷歌、LG、一加、三星、索尼、小米和其他供应商的各种设备。这个版本继续基于 Ubuntu 16.04 LTS，向 Ubuntu 20.04 LTS 的过渡仍在进行。


消息来源：Phoronix



老王点评：能继续保持更新已属不易，过渡到新的 Ubuntu 版本确实需要很长时间。没有商业公司支持的开源项目，往往很难。]]></summary>

远程桌面客户端允许你连接到任何其他桌面/服务器，并远程执行任务。它是一种重要的 IT 支持和商业用例。在 Linux 中，有许多远程桌面客户端可用。其中一些是免费的，而另一些是付费版本。所有这些客户端都支持流行的 远程桌面协议Remote Desktop Protocol（RDP），如 VNC、RDP 等等。

本文将介绍一些适用于 Ubuntu 和其他发行版的最佳免费远程桌面客户端。该列表包括自由开源的应用程序，以及一些免费使用但专有的应用程序。

注意：你的目标系统中需要一个远程桌面服务器（如 Xrdp）来成功建立远程连接。然后你才能使用以下应用程序进行连接。这是一个双向的过程。如果你想了解更多的情况，请参考我们的一个案例研究：


通过 RDP 从 Windows 连接到 Ubuntu


适用于 Linux 的最佳远程桌面客户端

GNOME Connections



第一个远程桌面客户端是一个原生的 GNOME 应用程序：GNOME 连接Connections 应用。这个基于 GTK 的应用程序带来了一个简单的用户界面。它是一个非常适合初学者的应用程序。它可以在一分钟内快速设置和连接（如果你知道 IP 和其他细节）。

此外，它还提供了清晰的指示，说明你是要连接到 Linux 还是 Windows。GNOME 连接应用支持 VNC（针对 Linux）和 RDP（针对 Windows）协议。

用 Flatpak 安装这个应用程序超级简单。设置你的系统以使用 Flatpak，并使用以下命令进行安装：

flatpak install flathub org.gnome.Connections

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A little bit of background. 
 Some years ago, Ubuntu had Amazon integration with Unity’s search feature. This caused quite an uproar in the Linux community with the eventual removal of Amazon (at least from what I am aware, I apologize if I am wrong). 
 The Amazon integration should never happened due to Amazon’s war on privacy with them being arguably the least privacy-friendly company in existence. For Ubuntu to even think it was a good idea for the integration is an insult and a disconnect to the entire Linux community and what most Linux users try to go for. 
 Next they created the Snap store. Although the store is open source (100% a plus!), they have forced the proprietorship of the store, meaning that in order to get software on the snap store, you MUST go through Ubuntu. This is, again, an unpopular view with the community, with some popular distros, such as Linux Mint, disabling the store by default. 
 By these continuous decisions that are so disconnected from what a lot, if not most, Linux users want and are looking for when ditching Microsoft and Apple, and especially the past integration with Amazon, I feel that Ubuntu should not be listed as a trustworthy distro when it comes to privacy. 
 Now I’m not looking to specifically shit on Ubuntu and Canonical, moreoverso, I’m trying to get other views from the community and those who have chosen to stick it out with Ubuntu and why considering their recent anti-community practices. 
 Please this post was made in good faith, and I have used Ubuntu before (mostly Kubuntu KDE for the win) and I’m just looking for Ubuntu users (or Ubuntu spins users) with their opinions on Canonical and their past. 
 Thank you in advance and if this breaks the rules, please mods delete :)

        <link href="https://linux.cn/article-15290-1.html?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss"/>
        <updated>2022-11-26T01:56:57.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Fedora Silverblue 是 基于 Fedora Linux 构建的桌面操作系统。它非常适合日常使用、开发和基于容器的工作流程。它提供了 众多优势，例如能够在出现任何问题时回滚。如果你想在 Fedora Silverblue 系统上更新或变基到 Fedora Linux 37（这些说明与 Fedora Kinoite 类似），本文将告诉你如何操作。它不仅向你展示了该做什么，而且还向你展示了在发生不可预见的事情时如何恢复。

在实际对 Fedora Linux 37 进行变基之前，你应该应用任何待定的更新。在终端中输入以下内容：

$ rpm-ostree update


或通过 GNOME 软件Software 应用安装更新并重新启动。

使用 GNOME 软件应用变基

在更新页面上，GNOME 软件Software 应用向你显示有新版本的 Fedora Linux 可用。



你需要做的第一件事是下载新镜像，因此请点击“下载Download”按钮。这需要一些时间。完成后，你将看到更新已准备好安装。



点击 “重启并更新Restart & Upgrade” 按钮。此步骤只需要几分钟，最后计算机将重启。重启后，你将获得全新的 Fedora Linux 37 版本。很简单，不是吗？

使用终端变基

如果你喜欢在终端中完成所有操作，那么本指南的这一部分适合你。

使用终端变基到 Fedora Linux 37 很容易。首先，检查 37 分支是否可用：

$ ostree remote refs fedora


你应该在输出中看到以下内容：

fedora:fedora/37/x86_64/silverblue


如果你想置顶当前部署（该部署将作为 GRUB 中的选项保留，直到你删除它），你可以通过运行以下命令来完成：

# 0 is entry position in rpm-ostree status
$ sudo ostree admin pin 0


要删除置顶部署，请使用以下命令：

# 2 is entry position in rpm-ostree status
$ sudo ostree admin pin --unpin 2


其中 2 是 rpm-ostree 状态中的位置。

接下来，将你的系统重新设置为 Fedora Linux 37 分支。

$ rpm-ostree rebase fedora:fedora/37/x86_64/silverblue


最后，要做的最后一件事是重新启动计算机并引导至 Fedora Linux 37。

如何回滚

如果发生任何不好的事情，例如，如果你根本无法启动到 Fedora Linux 37，这很容易回滚。在引导时选择 GRUB 菜单中的上一个条目（如果你没有看到它，请尝试在引导过程中按 ESC），你的系统将以切换到 Fedora Linux 37 之前的先前状态启动。要使此更改永久生效，请使用以下命令：

$ rpm-ostree rollback


就是这样。现在你知道如何将 Fedora Silverblue 变基到 Fedora Linux 37 并回滚。那么为什么不在今天做呢？

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[当地时间周五（11月25日），美国联邦通信委员会（FCC）宣布，禁止华为、中兴通讯、海康威视、海能达和浙江大华五家公司在美国销售设备。


FCC称这五家的产品“对美国国家安全构成不可接受的风险”。FCC此举的依据是其于2019年颁布的一项旨在保护美国通信网络安全的法律。


早在FCC做出这一决定之前，华为、中兴通讯、海康威视、海能达和浙江大华五家公司就已被列入所谓“对美国国家安全造成威胁的安全风险”清单，进入清单的公司被认定对美国国家通信安全构成威胁。除了上述五家公司外，中国移动、中国电信和中国联通也被列入了该清单。


去年由拜登政府正式把安全装置法签署生效之后，FCC联邦通信委员会在全票通过之后，于今天正式引用条文禁止多家中国企业的电讯和视像监控产品获得认证，换句话说就是要在当地禁售今后的产品，当中点名华为、中兴、大华、海康威视（Hikvision）和海能达（Hytera）。


FCC主席Jessica Rosenworcel在新闻稿中提到，他们的行动是为了保护美国国家安全，拒绝境内出现不被信任的通讯装置，特别是使用联邦基金的地方。 Rosenworcel提到会寻求重新审视，甚至是撤销涵盖名单（covered list）上产品的进网准许。


今年3月，FCC将中国电信美洲公司和中国移动国际（美国）有限公司列入“对美国国家安全造成威胁的安全风险”清单。


今年9月20日，FCC再次将中国联通美洲运营有限公司与中资电信企业太平洋网络有限公司及其全资子公司信通列入上述清单。

谷歌安全团队称谷歌等安卓手机厂商迟迟没有修补漏洞

谷歌的 Project Zero 团队说，他们在 6、7 月间发现了 5 个新问题，并告知了 ARM 公司。ARM 在 7、8 月间发布了修复程序。然而，在三个月后，包括三星、小米、Oppo 和谷歌在内的智能手机制造商还没有部署补丁来修复这些漏洞。这些漏洞可以使恶意黑客绕过安卓系统的权限模型，获得对系统的完全访问权。

GitHub 正在测试在 Markdown 中嵌入 JavaScript

GitHub 正在内测在其仓库内的 Markdown 文件内嵌入 JavaScript 代码，这被称之为 “GitHub Blocks”。Markdown 通常用来做代码仓库的说明和文档。通过嵌入 JavaScript，调用 GitHub 提供的 RESTful API，可以使 Markdown 文件变成动态的。它的用例包括渲染字体和颜色，在格式化的表格中显示 JSON 数据，显示仓库分析，如贡献者、问题统计、提交和拉动请求，显示图表，以及动态演示应用功能。

老王点评：这样就把 Markdown 变成富文本的，动态的了，是不是和 Markdown 本身的初衷背道而驰了？]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[我们列出了 2022 年适用于 Linux 和 Windows 的六个最佳 Python 代码编辑器。


如今，Python 无处不在，它可以说是现代版的 C 语言编程语言。从网站、应用程序、数据科学项目、人工智能到物联网设备，你可以发现 Python 无处不在。因此，作为这十年来流行的编程语言，了解 Python 的开发环境是很有必要的，开发人员用它创建应用程序，特别是如果你是刚刚开始学习 Python 编程，更需要了解 Python 开发环境。

许多 Python 开发环境都提供了可以满足你需求的功能和工具。其中有些环境对学习 Python 的初学者很有用，而另外一些用户则适用于重型 Python 开发和复杂的设置。在这里，在这篇文章中，我将谈一谈其中最好的几个，这将有助于你根据自己的需要和使用情况选择一个。

最好的 Python 编码编辑器

这个榜单上有以下几个编辑器：


Visual Studio Code

Eclipse

PyCharm

Spyder

Sublime Text

Thonny


1、Visual Studio Code



尽管它是微软创造的，但 Visual Studio Code 是最好的代码编辑器之一。不仅是 Python，对于所有流行和趋势的编程语言都是。

它具有语法高亮、代码补完、调试、代码片段、内置 Git 等诸如此类的功能。对于新手来说，它有点复杂，但也只需几个小时就能学会。

然而，它是用 Electron 框架构建的，可能会感觉稍微慢一些。但在高端的开发硬件下这不是问题。它是一个自由开源的应用程序，适用于 Linux、macOS 和 Windows。

以下是适用于 Ubuntu、Fedora 和相关发行版的单个 deb 和 RPM 包：

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[这是有关如何在 Oracle VirtualBox 中启用 USB 的指南。




当你在虚拟机环境中工作时，USB 通常插入主机系统。但是从客体系统访问 USB 内容有点困难。

在 VirtualBox 中，你需要安装一些扩展并启用一些设置才能访问 USB。方法如下。

本文假设你已经安装了 VirtualBox，并且还在其中安装了一些 Linux 发行版或操作系统。

如果没有，请查看 这篇文章。


请注意，Oracle VM VirtualBox 扩展包采用 Oracle 的个人使用和评估许可证（PUEL）。该许可证与 VirtualBox 不同，后者采用的是 GPL。如果你将下面的步骤用于商业目的，请确保你仔细阅读 本页面。


在 VirtualBox 7.0 中启用 USB

安装 VirtualBox 扩展包

打开 VirtualBox 下载页面并从 此链接 下载适用于所有支持平台的 VirtualBox 扩展包。



然后单击 “文件File > 工具Tools > 扩展包管理器Extension Pack Manager”。

单击工具栏中的 “安装Install” 按钮并选择下载的 .vbox-extpak 文件。

点击 “安装Install”。接受条款，并为安装提供管理员密码。





安装成功后，可以在已安装列表中看到。

重启主机系统。重启是强制性的。

在客体机中启用 USB

将 U 盘插入你的宿主机系统，你希望从虚拟机中访问该系统。

启动 VirtualBox 并右键单击要启用 USB 的虚拟机名称。选择“设置Settings”。



在左窗格中，单击 USB。然后选择控制器版本。例如，你可以选择 USB 3.0。然后单击小加号图标添加 USB 过滤器。

在此列表中，你应该看到你的 U 盘名称（你插入的）。对于这个例子，我可以看到我插入的 Transcend Jetflash 驱动器。

选择它并按 “OK”。



现在，启动你的虚拟机。打开文件管理器，你应该会看到 U 盘已启用并挂载到你的虚拟机上。

在此演示中，你可以看到我的 Arch-Xfce 虚拟机的 Thunar 文件管理器正在显示我的 U 盘中的内容。



使用说明

现在，这里有几件事你应该记住。

当你在主机系统中插入 U 盘时，请保持挂载状态。但在启动虚拟机之前不要打开或访问任何文件。

启动虚拟机后，U 盘将在主机系统中卸载并自动挂载到客体系统中，即你的虚拟机。

使用完 U 盘后，确保在虚拟机中将其弹出或卸载。然后它将能再从你的主机系统内访问。

总结

VirtualBox 是一个功能强大的程序，提供易于使用的功能来设置的你虚拟机。这些步骤很简单，并确保你的 U 盘在主机系统中被正确检测到以正常工作。

另外，请记住，通过扩展包检测 U 盘与 VirtualBox 客户端增强包无关。它们完全不相关并提供独立的功能。

最后，如果本指南对你有帮助，请在评论栏中告诉我。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I operate multiple apps which were providing my entire livelihood, and I wake up one day to realize it's all gone.
Long story short, Google froze my Google Pay account which is used to pay for anything related to Google services, including GCP. This was done as they need to temporarily suspend me to 'verify' me. The GCP team couldn't help me since it was an issue with Google Pay. Not to mention their chat support is useless and doesn't have any power to look into cases.
Now I login to find out my Google Pay account is 'temporarily suspended' since I need to verify my account. I go ahead and add my drivers license and fill out their form, but while they verify details they suspend your ability to pay for any Google services.
So now I can't pay for GCP usage (firebase) and all my authentication, database, cloud functions, are all not usable since the service is suspended. Unlike Amazon who offers phone lines for resolving billing issues, Google does no such thing. I wish I chose AWS.
The end result is that I have apps I spent years of my life building and which currently feed me to only be rendered unusable because some AI at google thought my Google Pay needed additional verification.
My whole life has done a 180 in the past week. I feel like I'm a man with literally nothing to lose and I can't live with myself anymore. This hurts much more than losing a job for me.
Please stay far, far away from Google services of any kind. They are by far the worst of the big tech companies when it comes to developer support.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I wanted to see how difficult it would be to build a web app using a sub-$300 android smartphone. Decided to build a fun predictions website where you could bet virtual (not real) money on predictions made by others, and also make predictions of your own.
Building it turned out to be considerably easier and more fun than I anticipated.
Primary tools used were:
# QuickEdit as the mobile code editor (Note: the free version of the QuickEdit app is riddled with ads, it shows an advert each time you close a tab, but it unfortunately had the best UI of the 3 or so Android code editors I tested. Ended up using NetGuard to block it from retrieving & displaying ads),
# PHP for the Backend ( custom PHP microframework I've used and built on over the past few years ).
# jQuery for the frontend js (cringing) - it appears I'm simply too lazy to learn React/Vue/et al. Every once in a while, I pick one of them to learn, but I always end up returning to jQuery - or time-permitting - amateur level vanilla JS.
# Bootstrap for the CSS - Battle-tested. For a purely backend dev with minimal design skills, good ol' Bootstrap (and in a growing number of cases, Tailwind) is always a life saver.
# Whole thing is hosted on 2 VMs (1 hosting the web app, and 1 hosting Redis & MySQL).
# As to the site itself, it turned out to be pretty cool to play around with. Go there, view the predictions, bet on the predictions you believe will come true, or against the ones you think will not. You get $50,000 to bet with (not real money). No signup is required to bet, but a quick signup is required to make a prediction. Hope you guys like it, and please be ruthless in telling me of any bugs you've found.
So go on here => kudotap.com
And Have Fun!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Thanks in advance. I’m at the point of liking Linux and being comfortable enough with it to use as daily driver but I’m missing some 3rd party software I would need before I could completely give up on Mac OS. QuickBooks for my business accounting and Quicken for home finances are not available for Linux. What alternatives would you recommend? 
 Another is a calendar app which syncs with iCal calendar, which I believe uses the CalDAV protocol? Really if there are desktop apps that work with iCloud for calendar, notes, email, contacts, and messaging that would be amazing so I don’t have to rely on Google. I’m not skilled enough to get NextCloud working.

 I was in need of some screenshot software beyond the default mate-screenshot I have on Linux Mint and I decided to research a couple options. My goal is to be able to take screen-grabs without too much “fuzz” and paste them into a document I’m writing (e.g. into an email). At the same time, I want the option to add annotations to some of my screenshots. The two tools I decided to look into are Flameshot and Shutter.
 Flameshot
 Once you run it, it gets added to the system tray:

 When you click the icon, an intuitive dark overlay covers the screen but it also includes reminder on how to use the most common functions of the tool:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've played around with Linux before but never daily drove it cause I felt like it was too much of a pain with little gain to switch over, but a few days ago I decided to just try it properly once and for all. I partitioned a small 64GB on my laptop and daily drove it, and holy shit, its so good! I can customize it so much, boot time is noticeably faster and it runs most of my apps well. And the main part is that the OS is instantly usable as soon as it loads in, unlike Windows where I have to give it a few seconds for everything to settle down first. Linux is just underrated. 
 I dont know if this belongs here. But I am genuinely surprised big time by how good Linux is. Its honestly a no bullshit OS which I've been looking for all my life.

For example why not to create crowdfunding to pay someone to make a fractional scaling for gnome (then of course it will be curated by GNOME Project), or any other problem that i just cannot recall. Basically same as donation, but users know for sure where their money goes.
 I dont think that i am the first person thinked about it, so does anyone knows why no one did this before?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[哪些是最基本的 Linux 的命令？

经常有读者问我这个问题，我一直试图避免回答这个问题。

为什么呢？我不知道 Linux 命令吗？不是的。这不是原因。而是因为很难对它们进行分类。对我来说必不可少的东西对你来说可能并不重要。

但我想这适用于所有的东西，我们网站上的每一个这样的推荐应用程序列表也都是这样。

这就是为什么我最终放弃了，并创建了这个基本但重要的 Linux 命令列表，它应该对作为 Linux 用户的你有所帮助。这更多的是针对 Ubuntu 这样的桌面用户，但如果你把 Ubuntu 作为服务器使用，它们也应该对你有所帮助。

Linux 的基本命令

我在这里列出的每个命令都有多个选项和多种用途。如果我尝试给出每个命令的最常见的例子，它将很容易变成一本超过一万字的口袋书。

我不会详述这些命令中的任何一个。我将列出每个命令的目的及其基本语法。你可以从这些命令的链接教程中阅读更多关于使用这些命令的信息。

在你开始阅读列表之前推荐阅读：


Linux 中路径的概念

文件权限的概念

了解 Linux 终端的行话


还有一件事。我在这里更多地使用了文件夹这个术语，而不是目录。

在 Linux 中文件夹被称为目录，有些人可能不喜欢这样。然而，我相信对于初学者来说，这更容易掌握。

1、ls 命令：列出一个文件夹的内容

这是一个新的 Linux 用户最先学会的几个命令之一。这个命令可以让你看到当前文件夹里有哪些文件和文件夹。

ls


你可以使用长列表选项 ls -l 来查看细节，如文件大小、权限、修改时间等。如果你想，你可以对这些选项进行排序和控制。

ls -l

ls 命令示例


2、cd 命令：改变目录

默认情况下，你从你的主目录下开始。你经常需要改变目录并移动到…]]></summary>

每年 1200 美元的订阅费，可以将发动机的输出功率提高 20-24%，增加扭矩，以及在动态驾驶模式下将百公里加速时间缩短近 1 秒来提高性能。这项服务并不附带任何物理硬件的升级，相反，只需要解锁就可以使用。这个功能提供在奔驰的两款电动汽车上。


消息来源：The Verge



老王点评：订阅制汽车，以后或许生活中所有主要家电都要付费使用，像付电费一样。




攻击者利用数十年前的软件入侵电网

微软警告说，恶意黑客正在利用常见的物联网设备中发现的一个已停用的 Boa Web 服务器来攻击能源领域。在 Boa Web 服务器中发现了一个易受攻击的开源组件，尽管该软件于 2005 年退役，但仍被广泛用于一系列路由器和安全摄像头，以及流行的软件开发工具包。微软表示，在一周的时间里，它已经在全球范围内发现了 100 万个暴露在互联网上的 Boa 服务器组件。

老王点评：遗留的旧软件带来的问题，对无法更新的 IoT 设备是巨大的隐患，这都是历史欠账。




旧金山警方申请部署武装机器人

旧金山警察局目前正在向该市监事会提出申请，要求允许部署机器人来杀死执法部门认为有足够威胁的嫌疑人。警方称，“可能会出现部署致命武力是唯一选择的情况”。这项提案已经遭到了监事会内外的巨大反对。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[微软计划在2023年2月将旗下Internet Explorer 11（简称IE11）网络浏览器在某些Windows系统中禁用。微软计划通过2023年2月累积安全更新在Windows 10系统上永久禁用IE11，这样以后就不能再重新激活和使用了。


目前除了Windows10，IE11也可以在早期版本的Windows上使用，但Windows 7 ESU和Windows 8.1扩展系统最终将在2023年1月结束支持。在停止支持它们后，微软将集中精力处理Windows 10系统相关事宜。


微软已经在网站和Microsoft365管理中心确认了该决定。


“作为计划于2023年2月14日发布的2023年2月Windows安全更新(“B”)的一部分，某些版本的Windows 10将永久禁用已停用的、不支持的Internet Explorer 11(IE11)桌面应用程序。强烈建议在此日期之前在Microsoft Edge中设置IE模式并禁用IE11，以确保你的组织不会遇到业务中断。”


据微软称，以后任何对IE11的调用都将自动重定向到Microsoft Edge网页浏览器。


IT之家获悉，IE11的支持在2022年6月15日结束，第一阶段的退役开始。在该阶段，IE11仍然保留在系统上，但对IE的调用被重定向到Microsoft Edge。第二阶段将从系统中卸载IE11的组件，但微软直到现在也没有提供截止日期。


微软计划在2023年1月17日为Windows 10和Windows 11发布可选更新；该可选的非安全更新将从Windows设备上删除安装的IE11。然后，在2023年2月14日，IE浏览器将作为2月补丁日的一部分被自动删除。可选的更新会提前删除组件，但补丁日的更新将在所有支持的系统上删除。


微软在Microsoft Edge中创建了IE模式，为组织和家庭用户提供了加载需要Internet Explorer技术内容的选项。特别是组织可能操作需要某些Internet Explorer技术的内容。Edge中的IE模式就是为了加载这些内容而设计的。


删除IE11不会从Windows系统中删除该浏览器的所有组件。虽然它不能再运行，但IE的一些组件可能仍然被操作系统上的程序所需要。

 So you type MOZ_USE_XINPUT2=1 firefox into you terminal... and it works! But here's the problem: now you have to make that variable permanent so you don't have to launch Firefox using the terminal every time.

        <updated>2022-11-24T03:49:57.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Audacity 是一个自由开源的跨平台 音频编辑器。专业人士使用它是因为它提供的功能仅需安装很小的软件包。

你不必成为一名专业人士并使用它的所有功能。你可以使用它从麦克风录制音频，并执行一些基本操作，如背景噪声消除。

我将在本教程中向你展示如何做到这一点。

在 Linux 上安装 Audacity

在 Linux 上安装 Audacity 是一个非常简单的过程。由于其受欢迎，可以在大多数 Linux 发行版的官方存储库中找到它。

你可以在发行版的软件中心或软件包管理器中搜索它。

作为一个终端爱好者，让我分享一下常见发行版的命令。

对于基于 Debian 或 Ubuntu 的发行版：

sudo apt install audacity


对于基于 RHEL 或 Fedora 的发行版：

sudo dnf install audacity


如果你在用基于 Arch 的发行版：

sudo pacman -Syu audacity


注意，通过官方存储库安装可能无法获得 最新版本。要获得最新版本，你可以使用 AppImage 或 Flatpak/Snap 软件包。

使用 Audacity 录制音频

安装 Audacity 后，从应用程序菜单打开它或从终端启动它。你会看到这样的界面：



单击“录制”按钮（红点）即可轻松开始录制。完成后，单击“ 停止”按钮（方形图标）来结束录制。你还可以预览录制的波形，如下所示：



然后，你可以通过单击“播放”按钮（绿色图标）检查录制的内容。

如果你没有看到任何波形，则表示未录制到任何内容。很可能，你没有正确设置音频输入。确保你选择了正确的麦克风，并确保在“系统设置system settings”中其未被静音。你也可以通过 Audacity 接口设置。

录音不会自动保存为 MP3 或其他格式。要保存录音，你可以转到 “文件File → 导出Export” 并选择 “导出为 MP3Export as MP3”（或任何其他想要的格式）。

使用 Audacity 降低背景噪声

Audacity 还有另一个很棒的功能，你可以使用它来减少录制音频中的白噪声。

最好的做法是在开始使用 Audacity 录制时的前五秒不要说任何话。这将为你提供所需的背景噪声。

在录制音频的波形上，选择你认为是背景噪声的部分。



选择噪声部分后，从顶部文件菜单中转到 “效果Effects → 降低噪音Noise Reduction”。

它会像这样打开一个弹出窗口。单击此处的 “获取噪音配置文件Get Noise Profile”。



现在，你已经设置了噪声配置文件。现在，你必须使用它来减少录音中的噪声。

按 Ctrl + A 快捷键选择整段录音。你也可以选择其中的一部分，仅对所选部分减少噪声。

选择音轨后，再次转到 “效果Effects → 降低噪音Noise Reduction”。

这次不要单击 “获取噪音配置文件Get Noise Profile”。这一次，你应该能够按下 “OK” 按钮。

只需按下 “OK” 按钮，即可将降噪效果应用到录音中，并反映在波形上，如下所示：



现在，相较而言，录制的音频将具有更少的噪声。你可以在选择 “降低噪音Noise Reduction” 效果时微调噪声过滤。

总结如下：


选择噪声部分，转到 “效果Effects → 降低噪音Noise Reduction”，然后单击 “获取噪音配置文件Get Noise Profile”

按 Ctrl + A 选择整段音频录制，转到 “效果Effects → 降低噪音Noise Reduction”，这次按 OK 按钮


请注意，你无法移除所有类型的噪声，但这应该会有所帮助。

Audacity 能做更多事情

使用 Audacity 录制音频可能不像使用 GNOME 录音机那样简单，但它并不太复杂。如果你正在录制画外音，降噪功能将非常有用。

Audacity 有更多其他功能，不可能在一个教程中涵盖所有这些功能。这就是为什么我会保持简短的原因。

如果你不能接受 2021 年的 Audacity 的隐私政策调整，试试其他可用的工具。

我希望这个小教程能帮助你使用 Audacity 进行音频录制。如果你有问题或建议，请告诉我。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[以下是如何在 Ubuntu 和其他 Linux 发行版中安装 LibreOffice Base 数据库模块。


流行的自由开源的办公套件 LibreOffice 由六个独立的组件组成。然而，Ubuntu 和相关发行版中默认安装的 LibreOffice 只包括其中的五个：


Calc

Writer

Impress

Draw

Math


由于某些原因，数据库模块 LibreOffice Base 没有被包括在内。所以，这里告诉你如何在 Ubuntu 和其他发行版中单独安装它。

在 Ubuntu 和其他 Linux 中安装 LibreOffice Base

你可以使用 “软件Software” 应用或终端来安装 libreoffic-base 包。我建议使用终端来安装它。打开一个终端窗口，运行以下命令来安装它。

sudo apt install libreoffice-base


如果你喜欢 “软件Software” 应用 或其他基于 GUI 的安装程序，搜索 “libreoffic-base” 并点击安装。

对于 Fedora 和基于 RPM 的发行版，使用以下命令：

sudo dnf install libreoffice-base


如果你在 Arch Linux 中安装了 LibreOffice，无论是 libreoffic-fresh 还是 libreoffic-still，那么就不需要任何操作了。LibreOffice Base 已经包含在这两个软件包中了。你可以开始使用了。

在另一个方面，如果你想看看如何安装最新的 LibreOffice，请查看 这个指南。



最后，安装完毕后，你可以在应用菜单中找出 LibreOffice Base。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I presume that the Linux kernel has some automated testing in place. I am curious to know the logistics behind testing that requires a specific hardware. For example, a hardware driver for a specific printer (or anything, really). 
 Does Linux kernel have a distributed approach to testing, where people that own specific hardware test each pre-release on their hardware (I assume that would be really unlikely)? Do they do mock testing? I am thinking of the scale of the kernel and the number of hardware supported out-of-the-box, and how easily it would be for things to go wrong with a bad change, so I imagine that testing is really important.
 I am thinking more of changes to the kernel core that could break modules than changes to modules. I imagine when changes to modules are made for specific hardware, the contributor has responsibility to at least test before they submit their patch.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I took a minute (a few hours) to prepare a PPA for some deb packages I have been building for awhile, and let me tell you, there are about a billion ways that can break that I don't want to support. Let's put it this way -- it wasn't exactly fun. There were a few missteps. And I'm not certain I won't break it on the next update. Updating automatically is a chore, and isn't done yet, because I don't understand GitHub Actions.
 After all this I thought, why doesn't someone do this for me? After all my software works for me. I mean -- deb packages are great, but I don't really need a deb package built for me, and a PPA to deliver it to my door. This is mostly something I'm doing to help someone else.
 And my goodness how much digital ink has been spilled in r/linux and r/ubuntu regarding how much people hate Snaps. Given the grassroots support, you'd think there would be a group of folks just constantly building native Linux deb packages for other folks because of how easy it is (for them, not for me obviously). A concierge service if you will. 
 Wait a minute! Why isn't there a group that does nothing but build and distribute all native Linux packages? Because I want to support the entire archipelago of Linux systems for goodness sakes! If it's so easy (for them obviously, not me) to turn around a package and a repo, if thats what the Linux Desktop Users are demanding, why is this not a thing?! Obviously, it's super important. They talk about it all the time. And these people that talk and talk would be lining up to do something about the scourge of non-native packages.
 So I think this is (finally) one of those bright ideas and I wanted to share it with you. I think I am ready for someone else to literally build me a world without Snaps/Flatpak/AppImage.

 I have been working on creating my own KDE based Alpine Desktop, originally intended for use on my laptop, but possibly now as a persistent USB... It's been a journey - but I think it's going to be worth it in the long run. 
 I would like to know what others think about using Alpine as a daily desktop - I know it's not what the OS is developed or intended for, but I've always felt that it could be made into a good lightweight alternative to the available linux desktops. 
 Anyone else using Alpine as a desktop?
 Any thoughts on it? Would this seem like a pipe dream or a worthwhile endeavor?
 Thanks. 😊🙃

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey everyone!
In the last months I've been working on Unclutter, a modern reader mode browser extension. In contrast to all existing approaches, it unclutters articles by modifying their CSS instead of extracting the text content.
This results in a more visually pleasing result that reuses the original article style. The idea is to remove friction so you use the reader mode more often.
There are a few more features around saving articles automatically and taking highlights -- more details are on the website.
The extension has about 400 active weekly users right now, mostly from organic web store traffic. Monetisation has proven to be hard and for freemium there would need to be much higher numbers anyways.
Do you think I should keep working on the project?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[据华尔街日报中文网援引The Information报道称，Alphabet旗下的谷歌正在考虑裁员1万人，占其全球员工总数的6%。


报道指出，此举将基于一个排名系统，该系统将淘汰排名最低的“表现不佳”的员工。


报道还称，谷歌发言人在一份声明中表示，“今年早些时候，我们推出了谷歌评估和发展系统，以帮助员工获得全年的发展、辅导、学习和职业进步。这一新系统有助于建立明确的期望，并为员工提供定期反馈。”


另据美国消费者新闻与商业频道(CNBC)报道称，谷歌公司内部的焦虑情绪正在上升。


上述报道提到，谷歌的业务受到的打击并不像许多同行那样严重，但潜在的衰退、通胀飙升和利率上升的综合影响正在产生明显的影响。


此外，Alphabet的高管们近期还强调，公司需要更专注，降低各种项目的成本，并使公司的效率提高20%。其首席执行官皮查伊曾表示，“显而易见的是，我们正面临着一个具有挑战性的宏观环境，未来将有更多的不确定性。”


Alphabet的净利也在下降。三季报显示，其第三季营收为690.9亿美元，低于市场预期的705.8亿美元，去年同期为651.2亿美元；净利润从去年同期的189.4亿美元大幅下滑至139.1亿美元。


近期，包括Meta、推特、亚马逊、Carvana、思科、Lyft和Stripe在内的科技公司都陷入了裁员风波，这影响了全球数以万计的工作岗位。


对此，华尔街日报分析指出，疫情开始后，随着用户的消费行为都转向线上，科技公司的收入和员工人数出现了爆发式增长。但如今，疫情红利逐渐消退，科技巨头们不得不裁减数以千计的员工。

我经常使用程序坞。在本文中，我将分享一些关于有效使用程序坞的小技巧，并介绍自定义程序坞的外观和位置的方法。

你将在本教程中学习到以下内容：


程序坞的基本用途：添加应用程序，并使用快捷方式来启动应用程序

自定义程序坞的外观：更改图标大小、图标位置

更改程序坞的位置：可用于单屏和多显示器的设置

在程序坞中隐藏已安装的磁盘图标

自动隐藏或禁用程序坞

使用 dconf-editor 对程序坞进行额外的定制

用其他程序坞应用程序替换 Ubuntu 默认的程序坞


我将在教程中使用 程序坞dock、面板panel和 启动器launcher 等术语，它们的意思是等同的。

如何使用 Ubuntu 程序坞：你必须知道的基础知识

如果你是 Ubuntu 的新手，你需要掌握如何使用程序坞。尽管，在一段时间后你总会熟悉程序坞的功能，但是阅读本文能让你更快地明白。

向程序坞添加新的应用程序（或删除应用程序）

这一步骤十分简单。从菜单中搜索你想要添加在程序坞的应用程序，然后运行它。

正在运行的应用程序会显示在程序坞中，它的图标在程序坞中所有图标的下方。右键单击该图标，然后选择 “添加到收藏夹Add to Favorites” 选项。这会把该应用程序的图标锁定到程序坞上。



从程序坞中删除应用程序的图标，操作起来更为简单。你不需要运行你想要在程序坞删除的应用程序，只需右键单击应用程序图标，然后选择 “从收藏夹中删除Remove From Favorites” 即可。



更改程序坞中的图标顺序

默认情况下，新添加到程序坞…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[以下是你如何在 Debian、Ubuntu 和其他发行版中修复 “sudo command not found” 错误的方法。


有时，当你第一次设置或安装 Linux 发行版 时，你在用 sudo 尝试一些命令时，会出现 “sudo command not found” 的错误。

sudo 命令是 “superuser do” 的缩写，它是一个允许用户以管理员权限执行命令的程序。sudo 命令帮助你像管理员用户一样运行程序/命令。

此外，用 sudo 运行命令的用户必须是 sudo 组的一部分。

你看到这个错误的主要原因是该软件包本身没有安装。然而，大多数现代 Linux 发行版都默认提供了这个功能，但有些则没有。

下面是解决这个问题需要遵循的步骤。

故障排除 #1

首先，安装 sudo 包来解决这个问题。打开一个终端，刷新你的系统，并运行以下命令来安装 sudo。

对于 Ubuntu、Debian 和相关发行版：

su -apt updateapt install sudo


对于 Arch Linux：

pacman -S sudo


对于 Fedora、RHEL 等：

su -dnf updatednf install sudo


上述安装完成后，你必须使用以下命令将用户添加到 sudo 组中。

usermod -aG sudo <yourusername>


然后从终端运行 visudo，并运行以下行。按 CTRL+O 和 CTRL+X 来保存和退出。



退出并再次登录使变化生效。

故障排除 #2

在做了上述改变之后，如果你仍然收到错误信息，那么请按照以下步骤操作。

确保你的 $PATH 变量包含 sudo 可执行文件的正确路径。如果 sudo 已经安装，但 $PATH 不正确，你也会得到这个错误。理想情况下，你的路径应该包含以下所有的路径。

echo $PATH


/usr/local/bin:/usr/local/sbin:/usr/bin:/usr/sbin


要改变路径变量，使用以下命令。例如，如果 /usr/bin 不存在，那么你可以通过以下方式添加它。

export PATH=$PATH:/usr/bin


然后注销并登录查看效果。

总结

我希望这个指南能帮助你解决 Linux 发行版中的 sudo 错误。表面上的解决方案很简单，真的。

如果有帮助，或者如果你有任何问题，请在下面留言。

 ​
 Wanted to highlight something I really appreciated and don't see lots of other projects do: their keybindings example file!
 You can find the keybindings here: https://github.com/mpv-player/mpv/blob/master/etc/input.conf
 Snippet:
 ## Seek units are in seconds, but note that these are limited by keyframes #RIGHT seek 5 # seek 5 seconds forward #LEFT seek -5 # seek 5 seconds backward #UP seek 60 # seek 1 minute forward #DOWN seek -60 # seek 1 minute backward 
 This is exactly what I want out of apps in terms of keybindings documentation! They make the format obvious, there's a helpful inline comment, I'm not left guessing where I can find a list of functions to bind to. Really good! I hope more open source projects follow their example, I think one of the biggest pain points with new users is navigating sorta arcane config/bindings files.

 Any recommended book(s) to learn in-depth knowledge about the Kernel?
 I somehow finished undergrad without taking an OS course. (because of scheduling issues. trust me I wanted to take an OS class)
 Lately I've been trying to learn about how Docker works under the hood, and I'm grasping some of the concepts. But I need a book. I prefer reading literal paper pages over the endless CLI man pages.

In short its an IDE (VSCode/JetBrains) plugin that lets you share blocks of code that link directly to the code inside your IDE or repo. We use it all the time and think its pretty nifty tech that lets you understand someone’s code in context very quickly.  we’re hoping to keep refining it to make it better and more useful.

project has put out a detailed
report on progress toward a working kernel and distribution.


	This kind of safety model is not new: it is already commonplace on
	Android phones, where it is usually implemented in DSP
	firmware. But of course, the desktop Linux ecosystem doesn’t even
	have a speaker EQ database framework yet, nevermind safety models!
	The eternal lagging behind of Linux audio strikes again. What’s the
	plan? While this isn’t settled yet, our current idea is to
	implement the safety model in a stand-alone daemon that captures
	the voltage/current feedback data from the ALSA device, and drives
	the mixer volume itself as as means of implementing soft power
	limits, together with some kind of “safety watchdog interlock” with
	the kernel that only enables higher volume limits when the daemon
	is active and running]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[11月22日，刘强东发布京东全员信。信中提到，为提高基层员工福利待遇，同时尽量减轻公司压力，集团决定自2023年1月1日起，京东集团副总监以上以及相对应的P/T序列以上全部高级管理人员，现金薪酬全部降低10%-20%不等，职位越高降得越多。


刘强东在邮件中表示，京东今天所有成功都离不开兄弟们的努力和坚持，在成功合并德邦之后，京东体系的员工总数已经突破了54万，相信未来京东可以为国家和社会直接带来超过100万就业岗位。


“德邦现有的员工，不管是外包还是自有的，都是我们的兄弟，自2023年1月1日起，逐步为十几万德邦的兄弟们缴齐五险一金，确保每个德邦兄弟都能‘老有所养，病有所医’，为兄弟们提供基础保障。过去，德邦的做法虽然合规合法，而且缴纳的五险一金比例远远超过其它同类公司，但依然有很多外包兄弟不能像自有员工一样享受全额五险一金待遇。我们会按照一定条件，逐步把外包兄弟转化为德邦自己的员工！让大家更有保障！”刘强东在信中表示。


目前，京东是行业内唯一一家与物流一线员工签订正式劳动合同并缴纳“五险一金”的公司，根据公开数据测算，2022年前三个季度，京东为一线员工的薪酬福利支出已超过330亿元。


“集团拿出100亿元人民币，为包括全体德邦兄弟们在内的所有集团基层员工设立‘住房保障基金’，我希望此举能为工作满五年以上全体员工，包括每一个快递兄弟和客服兄弟实现购房愿望。这是循环无息贷款基金，意味着未来十年，集团累积投入资金总额高达数百亿人民币。”刘强东在信中表示。


京东从自建物流之初就采用全职员工，与一线快递员签署劳动合同、缴纳五险一金，提供商业保险、通讯、防寒防暑、交通工具等多种福利及补贴。除了高于同行业平均水平的薪酬福利待遇之外，京东早在2012年就开始打造“安居计划”，向符合条件的员工提供最高100万的无抵押、无担保、无利息的资金支持，用于…]]></summary>

the hiring of a quality-assurance analyst, bringing its staff up to 13

	A lot of my time will be spent on triaging the issues users report

	activity on Bugzilla, and classifying and testing the reports is
	fundamental for us to focus on the most pressing issues, help the

 I would like to install the video driver for my nvidia graphics card, that does best on power management. I found this old article comparing the power consummption of both nvidia and nouveau, but I do think it is quiet outdated:
 https://www.phoronix.com/review/nouveau_power_comparison
 Now my question to you:
 Did anyone recently compare power consumption of proprietary nvidia driver, open nvidia driver and nouveau in a similar way?
 Thanks!

今年夏天，Ubuntu 为赛昉科技的昉・星光 RISC-V 单板计算机发布了官方镜像，而现在正在为即将发布的昉・星光 2 准备新的镜像。昉・星光 2 在几个月前宣布，将在年底陆续发货。它使用 SiFive 的 U74 四核 RISC-V SoC，运行频率高达 1.5GHz，有 2GB 到 8GB 的内存，双千兆以太网。除了 Ubuntu，他们还在努力支持多个 Linux 发行版。


消息来源：Phoronix



老王点评：新的板子更强大，价格也不贵，我觉得树莓派并不一定是最好的选择了。




英伟达称融化的 RTX 4090 是因为电源线没插好

在英伟达宣布它正在调查关于其 RTX 4090 显卡的电源线融化和燃烧的报告数周后，他们认为大多是因为电源线没插好而导致急剧发热。4090 使用了使用新标准的电源连接器，因而需要专门的适配器。调查显示，这个适配器在设计上缺乏正确插入指示，因此没有完全插好的电源线会急剧发热，从而融毁电源线和 GPU 等设备。


消息来源：The Verge



老王点评：虽然可能是用户没插好，但是其实归根到底是产品设计不够好。




高性能计算越来越多采用液冷

随着 400W 的 CPU 和 700W 的 GPU 的出现，对这些部件的冷却已经不能风扇所能满足的了。本周在达拉斯举行的超级计算会议上，展示了一些冷却设备，其中将冷板连接到 CPU、GPU 上的直接式液冷可以散掉 80%-90% 的热量；也有一些采用浸入式液冷，整个设备浸入在冷却液中或在密闭的机箱中注满冷却液。报告称，预计到 2026 年，液体和浸入式冷却设备的支出将达到 11 亿美元，占热管理支出的 19%。


消息来源：The Register



老王点评：只能说现在的计算设备越来越热了。]]></summary>

Everyone faces different risks: inflation, extreme weather, mortgage rates, Supreme Court decisions, student debt, and more. Our mission is to allow people and businesses to mitigate risks that relate to them.
We got into finance early during our time at MIT. Tarek worked at Goldman and Citadel, Luana worked at Bridgewater and Citadel. We noticed something common across all these places: a lot of trading stemmed from an opinion on a future event. For example, a lot of activity at Goldman at the time was focused on providing institutions with exposure to, or a hedge against, Brexit.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Kubernetes 的优势不仅在于它能够做什么，还在于知道它能为你做什么。




在 树莓派家庭实验室上运行 Kubernetes 的 5 个理由 这篇文章中，我解释了为什么推荐在家里使用 Kubernetes。其中的理由相对来说会有点随意，并且主要于关注结果。除了 Kubernetes 好用的功能之外，还有其他几个应将 Kubernetes 包含在你自己的计算机的理由。

（LCTT 译注：家庭实验室Homelab 指的是安置在你家里的一个服务器或者多服务器的组合配置。在之上托管了多个服务和虚拟系统，以此来进行测试、开发，或者提供家庭功能用途。）

1、Kubernetes 是基于 Linux 而建立的



Kubernetes 有很高的知名度。对于一些人来说，Kubernetes 是一种神秘技术，有一个不好念的名字；而对另一些人来说，Kubernetes 就好像是牧羊犬放牧羊群一样，可以帮助他们管理过多的容器；对于其它人来说，Kubernetes 是一种 云cloud 的操作系统，是 实效云开发effective cloud development 的一个有用的界面；对于大多数人来说，Kubernetes 可能是他们从未听说过的后端软件。正如人们所想的那样，Kubernetes 具有所有这些能力，甚至有更多的功能。

并非每个人都以相同的方式使用 Kubernetes，但如果你主要的工作是系统管理，你会发现 Kubernetes 只是又一个 Linux 命令。

我有一件 T 恤，上面写着 “容器就是 LinuxContainers are Linux”，它的意思是显而易见的。容器技术使用 cgroup，来运行包含一个或一组应用程序的最小 Linux 操作系统镜像。当你运行容器时，实际上你就是在运行 Linux。虽然 Kubernetes 能在许…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[在 Ubuntu 和其他 Linux 中安装最新的 LibreOffice 版本的快速指南。


自由开源的办公套件 LibreOffice 有两个版本：社区版和企业版。“社区” 版是为那些希望获得最新的尖端软件技术的早期采用者准备的。而 “企业” 版本更加稳定，可能不包括所有的最新功能，但它是生产环境和专业工作的理想选择。

在 Ubuntu 和其他 Linux 中安装最新的 LibreOffice

1、删除预安装的 LibreOffice

Ubuntu 和其他的 Linux 发行版带有预安装的 LibreOffice。这可能不是最新的，这是因为发行版有特定的发行周期。在进行新安装之前，你可以通过以下命令删除 Ubuntu 及其衍生发行版中的的旧版本。

打开一个终端并运行以下命令，以删除 Ubuntu 和相关发行版中的已安装的 LibreOffice。对于其他发行版，你可以使用发行版的软件包管理器将其删除。

sudo apt remove –purge libreoffice*
sudo apt autoclean
sudo apt autoremove


然后重启以确保一切正常（尽管你也可以跳过这一步）。

2、从网站上下载安装

前往 官方下载页面. 并通过从下拉菜单中选择类型下载 “最新的” 版本。对于 Ubuntu 和其他衍生产品，请选择 .deb 文件。



下载后，提取文件；你应该看到下面的所有软件包。



在提取文件的位置打开终端，并按顺序运行以下命令。首先，你需要安装 ure 包，其次是核心包，然后是所有的基本包。最后，就是主要的 LibreOffice 软件包。下面是一组典型的命令。你需要更改为具体版本的版本号。

sudo dpkg -i libobasis7.0-ure_7.0.4.2-2_amd64.deb
sudo dpkg -i libobasis7.0-core_7.0.4.2-2_amd64.deb
sudo dpkg -i libobasis7.0*


sudo dpkg -i libreoffice7.0*


如果你使用的是 Fedora Linux 或 Red Hat Linux，请按照上述相同的顺序使用 dnf 命令。



等待安装完成。完成后，你可以通过应用程序菜单找到 LibreOffice。



这应该完成安装最新 LibreOffice 的步骤。如果你不想遵循上述方法，请参阅以下选项。

通过 PPA 安装

如果你想通过 PPA 安装它，请按照以下步骤操作。确保在上面的第 1 步中删除现有的 LibreOffice。

sudo add-apt-repository ppa:libreoffice/ppa


最后，运行以下命令从这个官方 PPA 安装最新的 LibreOffice 5.4 系列。

sudo apt update
sudo apt install libreoffice


安装后，你可以通过 Dash 搜索启动 LibreOffice。



通过 Snap 和 Flatpak 安装

如果你是 Linux 用户，你可以尝试 LibreOffice 独立的可执行文件，它在 Snap 或 Flatpak 等沙箱中运行。

要通过 Flatpak 安装 LibreOffice ，请访问 这个页面 进行设置，然后运行以下命令进行安装：

flatpak install flathub org.libreoffice.LibreOffice


同样，对于 Snap 版本，使用以下命令进行安装：

sudo snap install libreoffice


如何升级到最新的 LibreOffice 版本？

如果你不想删除 LibreOffice 但想升级到最新版本，请阅读我们下面的完整指南。


在 Ubuntu、Linux Mint 和 Windows 中升级到最新的 LibreOffice


如果你在安装最新的 LibreOffice 时遇到问题，请随时留言。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[前言：先对广东潮州发生的2死多伤智能汽车失控事故致以默哀10分钟。


为啥写这篇文章，是因为看了很多网络评论的分析，都仅仅停留在刹车是否踩下等的初浅问题的讨论上。


作为某“大型”南极动物的工厂出来的前“某天网”安全架构师和项目主导人，我觉得有必要通过在网络安全角度，深入分析一下导致事故的各种因素，从而得出有利于对公众安全、长期认真真正负责任的分析。


首先我们知道，复杂系统一定是不可靠的，不管是谁做的。


这里先拿曾经的高铁动车事故来说：复杂的电信号和网络系统，总会因为人为的非人为的原因，导致系统层面的失控或者事故发生。


简单来说：对于安全而言，所有系统都有漏洞。  专业点来说：图灵完备的软件系统无法证明绝对正确。而智能汽车、智能电气系统，一定是有图灵完备的软件系统的：包含了spaceX这样的宇航员用的智能系统——曾经就发生过因为一个计算符号写少了等于号，所以价值几十亿美金的航天飞机失事，7个宇航员殉职。对没错，发生在美国。


温州动车事故发生后，作为没拿上岗许可证的程序员，内心很是惶恐。据说原因是某些没拿证的程序员开发的系统有BUG（程序错误）导致的信号系统失控。


当然，现在不用什么据说不据说，据说一般都是“谣言”。这里想说的是在各种事故发生了，总会有各种言论出来做为分析，不一定正确，但代表了某些人的看法。


某B音的飞机因传感器问题导致的软件系统失控，这里飞机驾驶员的权限还不如软件系统。然后大家都知道了，死了不少人，某型号的飞机也被禁飞了很久。


所以，我觉得：如果软件很重要，为什么不更注意安全多一些。在网络安全、软件安全、系统安全上投入多一些，总会带来更多的可靠性和品牌赞誉。


举了这么多例子，说了这么多事故的故事。那么我们如何来分析这次智能汽车导致的事故的原因呢？


智能系统一定是复杂系统，甚至…]]></summary>

一家初创公司借助 DALL-E 的 API 创建生成性的幻灯片（PPT），其产品旨在让用户在几分钟内，而不是几小时内创建幻灯片。他们发现，对于他们的大多数用户来说，“在几次尝试中可以得到一些有助于实现其观点的东西。”并且，他们还计划利用 GPT-3 对文件进行总结，添加到幻灯片中。


消息来源：Venture Beat



老王点评：这倒是一个好的应用，以后做 PPT 不用那么费劲就可以做出来了。




AI 辅助编程公司 Kite 关闭和宣布开源

成立于 2014 年的 AI 辅助编程公司 Kite 比 GitHub Copilot 起步更早，但很遗憾的是未能建立起一个盈利机制。Kite 虽然有 50 万月活跃开发者用户，但他们的支付意愿很低，仅仅提高程序员的编程速度 18% 并不能说服工程经理们掏钱。Kite 宣布停止运作，公开大部分源代码，项目托管在 GitHub 上。


消息来源：Kite



老王点评：看来 AI 替代人类进行编程，还有比较长的道路。




安全专家两年间秘密帮助解密勒索软件

安全研究人员在 Zeppelin 勒索软件的加密机制中发现了漏洞，并利用这些漏洞创建了一个工作的解密器，他们自 2020 年以来用于帮助受害公司恢复文件而不向攻击者付款。原本他们在 2020 年 2 月已经准备好了一份技术报告，但推迟了发布，以避免勒索黑帮知道，并悄悄帮助被勒索的机构恢复数据。可能是察觉了这种帮助解密的情况，现在 Zeppelin 采取了多次加密的方式来勒索赎金。


消息来源：Bleeping Computer



老王点评：说到底，勒索软件也是存在 bug 的，这就是和安全专家的博弈。]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[我们点评了为程序员和开发人员提供的十大最佳 Linux 发行版（2022 版），以帮助他们完成工作和个人项目。


程序员和开发人员在其工作或项目中会使用各种工具和应用程序，包括代码编辑器、编程语言编译器、附加组件、数据库等。如果你对现代开发者的工作流程进行分类，它包含以下典型的工作流程：


访问代码库

编程

调试

测试

部署


而这种典型的工作流程可能需要各种工具。一个标准的清单可能是这样的：


代码编辑器

简单的文本编辑器

网页浏览器（网页开发者需要所有变体）

数据库引擎

一个本地服务器

编程语言相应的编译器

调试器

监测或剖析工具（可执行文件或网络版）


可以说，与 Windows 相比，Linux 是编程的最佳选择。（出于几个原因，我在本文中不对 macOS 进行比较。）Linux 是最佳选择的主要原因是，与 Windows 相比，在 Linux 发行版中已经预装具有现代技术的软件包和应用程序，或非常容易安装。

因此，在这篇文章中，我们想列出 2022 年最适合程序员的 Linux 发行版。

2022 年适合程序员的十大 Linux 发行版

1、Fedora Workstation



也许这个名单中最完美的 Linux 发行版是 Fedora Linux。它用于桌面的默认 Workstation 版通过其选择的软件包带来了正宗的 GNOME 桌面体验。

Fedora Linux 的默认安装为你提供了所有主要的开发包，开箱即用。它们包括 PHP、OpenJDK、PostgreSQL、Django、Ruby on Rails、Ansible 等。

通过 dnf 软件包管理器安装更多的应用程序是非常简单的，如 VS Code 编辑器和其他软件包。你也可以借助“软件Softw…]]></summary>

 The conservative rolling model keeps behind a little bit, but not by a lot. New bugs introduced in major software versions have time to get squashed before reaching the end user.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I tried Wayland before, many times. Nvidia drivers not ready yet, also I noticed some tablet settings are missing, also forced vysnc not a good idea (I know, it's changed recently.). So, can you tell me the status of Wayland in 2022-2023? What features is missing? Any sacrifice of KDE customisations? 
 Edit: Thanks you guys, for all answers. For me multi monitor setup and modern hardware support so crucial. Also I worried about old X apps. I searched technical side of Wayland, my brain is melting- So, I still learning Wayland and compositor side. Missing features will be add in the near future, I'm really happy to Wayland succes. Windows have this same problem, they can't change this stuff, W11 same. I hope Windows side get better and secure one day. :'3

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[以下是你如何在 Debian、Ubuntu 和其他发行版中修复 “bash: wget command not found” 的错误。


著名的 wget 工具被用来通过终端从 URL 下载任何文件。它是 Linux 终端中最流行和最快速的工具之一。

作为一个 GNU 工具，wget 带来了一些奇妙的功能。你可以实现各种目的，如从网上提取信息、下载文件、暂停/恢复等。

然而，许多 Linux 发行版 在默认安装时并没有附带这个工具。因此，当你想用 wget 下载一些文件时，你会得到 wget 命令未找到的错误。

修复它其实很容易。

修复 wget 命令未找到

你所需要做的就是打开终端，运行以下命令来安装 wget。

对于 Ubuntu、Linux Mint、elementaryOS、Debian 和相关发行版：

sudo apt install wget


Arch Linux：

pacman -S wget


对于 Fedora（虽然它默认包括）：

sudo dnf install wget


安装后，你就可以使用 wget 程序了。你也可以通过检查其版本来验证它是否正确安装。

wget --version


如何使用 wget

下面是一些关于如何使用 wget 的例子。

命令的语法如下：

wget [选项]… [URL]…


例如，如果我想下载 Ubuntu 的 ISO 文件，那么我可以运行下面的命令，用 URL 直接下载。

wget https://releases.ubuntu.com/22.04.1/ubuntu-22.04.1-desktop-amd64.iso




同样，你也可以使用上述命令下载，或者，通过下面描述的几个开关组合。你也可以通过 wget --help 命令得到这个：


-t, --tries=NUMBER 设置重试次数为 NUMBER（0 为不限）

--retry-connrefused 即使连接被拒绝，也要重试

--retry-on-http-error=ERRORS 逗号分隔的 HTTP 错误列表，以便重试

-O, --output-document=FILE 将文件写入 FILE 中

--nc, --no-clobber 跳过那些会下载到现有文件的下载（即覆盖它们）

--no-netrc 不要试图从 .netrc 中获取证书

-c, --continue 继续已部分下载的文件

--start-pos=OFFSET 从 OFFSET 位置开始下载

--progress=TYPE 选择进度条类型

--show-progress 在详细模式下显示进度条

--N, --timestamping 不重新获取文件，除非比本地文件新

--no-if-modified-since 在时间戳模式下不使用条件性的 if-modified-since 获取请求的资源

--no-use-server-timestamps 不以服务器上的时间戳来设置本地文件的时间戳

--S, --server-response 打印服务器响应

--spider 不下载任何东西

-T, --timeout=SECONDS 设置所有的超时值为 SECONDS 秒

--dns-timeout=SECS 将 DNS 查询超时设置为 SECS

--connect-timeout=SECS 将连接超时设置为 SECS

--read-timeout=SECS 设置读取超时为 SECS

--w, --wait=SECONDS 在两次检索之间等待 SECONDS 秒（适用于检索的 URL 超过 1个）

--waitretry=SECONDS 在检索的重试之间等待 1 到 SECONDS 秒（适用于检索的 URL 超过 1 个）

--random-wait 在两次检索之间等待 0.5WAIT 到 1.5WAIT 秒（适用于检索的 URL 超过 1 个）


总结

我希望这个指南能帮助你解决 Linux 发行版中的 wget 错误。显然方案是非常简单的。

如果有帮助或者你有任何问题，请在下面留言。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[To all of you experts, kindly state in clear fashion why, if you choose any side of it.
 Let me start with my understanding (please don't fret) 
 I can assure you that git is software that gobbles up more of your time than anything else. But ...but ... It is worth spending time with something, which has an impact on long-term good and boosts efficiency guarantee. All you need is a little bit of patience to brush aside the difficulty it imposes.
 Make no mistake, that this damn thing is pretty hard to get efficient(I know ..I know, masters will say, you miss the point of its efficiency). But, I am looking at it, like an average person uses it and it takes tons of time to get the basics right(like everything else??)..
 If you think, there is a psychological barrier or mental block or grey cells of mine are not good enough to capture the vibe, then I must say, you are not wrong.
 So, flame(not to roast me, but to suggest, it is an old school lingo, pardon me) me with your understanding and, please, wit ,satire and subtility always bypass me somehow.
 Kindly, be to the point.
 Thank you.

 I was wondering, before I jump into it, what are main things that every novice should know about and first steps one should take after first install of linux distro ? 
 Oh btw, some dictionary would be awesome to have, like, explaining what distro means, what some commands mean, etc.
 Basically Linux lexicon would be great to have.

Or is it just another case of elitism and it being cool to crap all over the "normies"? I'm considering switching to Ubuntu and gnome from Fedora and KDE but I genuinely want to know if that's a mistake and whether I'll lose out on anything. Thanks :)

 Edit: before starting any war here. I use ubuntu since 2015. I like how gnome looks (I even liked unity). I feel that I am using something different than Windows and Mac. But when I compare it to any other flavor, I feel they are snappier, less machine demanding than gnome.
 I really want to understand.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Once more i tried to switch to Linux, i tried various distros, Debian, Ubuntu, Fedora and most recently Pop-OS.
 I never have issues switching to the new environment, it’s different but nice. Learning the different quirks and oddities is fun and in the end i get everything working well.
 But then comes the issue that gets me every time… audio quality. I am NOT an audiophile, i use normal desk speakers and a very decent headset. In windows i use a soundblaster z, before that i used an x-fi an, audigy 1 and SB Live.
 I realize creative offers no support on linux but the drivers are present in the kernel and audio works without much hassle.
 But everything sounds muffled, dull and too bassy. I tried the integrated sound card, same issue. Tried a USB headset, exactly the same problem. Tried external speakers, different headset it’s all the same.
 I followed tutorials on how to modify resampling, equalizers, switching to pipewire etc… Nothing got me clear sound. Modifying settings via alsamixer , modifying crystalizer etc. Nothing comes close to the audio experience in windows.
 And then came games. I love what valve is doing with proton and i own a steamdeck. On my steamdeck the audio is far better so i know it can be improved. I just do not know where to find what/how they do it.
 Positional audio is almost non existent on any of my linux installs everything gets forced into stereo. Selecting 5.1 always sends audio to the wrong channels. (Center channel to left front for ex.)
 So that is the only thing that keeps me from using linux, the abysmal sound experience breaks my spirit every time.
 Cheers.

 some of the good things I noticed: 
  
My two monitors have mismatched refresh rates and Wayland properly addressed them.
 Screentearing wasn't noticeable, if it even exists
 ...
  
That's it. Everything else is a regression.
 First off, if you're not using Gnome or KDE, you're pretty much a 3rd rate citizen. 
  
Screen sharing doesn't fucking work. Period. I do not consider a screensharing model where you have to share your entire screen or nothing as "working". You can't share individual applications.…]]></summary>

MacOS 包管理器 Homebrew 的创建者新开发了一个名为 Tea 的包管理器，作为 Homebrew 的最终继承者。Tea 除了一些包管理器的新功能之外，还有一种基于区块链的方法，以确保开源软件的创造者、维护者和贡献者都能为他们的努力获得报酬。他从 NFT 中获得了灵感，简单来说，关注开源软件生态健康的人可以购买通证并质押，而 Tea 作为一个 DAO 会奖励质押者和注册的软件包及其依赖关系的贡献者。

老王点评：一个探索的方向，不过我不是很看好。




协调世界时将停止添加“闰秒”

11 月 18 日，全球代表在计量大会（CGPM）上投票决定，“从 2035 年起，将搁置在官方时钟上增加‘闰秒’以使其与地球自转同步的做法。”这意味着从 2035 年开始，或者可能更早，天文时间（称为 UT1）将被允许与协调世界时（UTC）相差一秒以上，甚至多达一分钟，而协调世界时是以原子钟的稳定滴答为基础。添加闰秒的做法始于 1972 年。


消息来源：《自然杂志》



老王点评：添加闰秒给互联网服务和各种依赖精确计时的服务带来很多麻烦，而且我们可能还面临着史无前例的负闰秒。取消了也好。




GIMP 2.99.14 发布

这是迈向 GIMP 3.0 的最新开发版本，GIMP 3.0 将从 GTK2 切换到 GTK3 工具箱，并有大量仍在开发中的其他改进。此版本的具体改进没有什么太值得说的，在发布公告中说，“从 3.0 的路线图中可以看出，大多数项目都‘接近完成’或‘已经完成’。……真正接近了 GIMP 3.0 的发布。……开始针对具体的痛点，很多痛点。”

 It looks like now days people are hating on traditional packaging systems but I wanted to say my piece on the matter. I was trying to see the other side of the issue and discuss packaging generally. I would like to know what people actually think on the matter.

 I browsed distrowatch for a distro that I like. There are a lot of distros. 
 I decided to install Ubuntu.
 I love the open source feeling. It has a different feeling than Windows for sure. A lot of things working differently. I love the terminal, but i only can copy and paste commands. I want to learn to use it. The best command i know so far is neofetch. That looks very good! 
 Fortunately most of the sofwares i use are open source, so they are available on Linux too (VLC, Chromium, etc.).
 Thanks for reading my post.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[全球首富、推特新老板马斯克星期天（11月20日）在推特上公布恢复特朗普账号的决定。马斯克写道：“民众已经决定。将恢复特朗普（的账号）。人民之声，就是上帝之声。”


综合彭博社和路透社报道，马斯克星期五（18日）在推特展开24小时民调，询问网民是否应该恢复特朗普的账号，共收到超过1500万张票，赞同者以51.8%胜出。


就允许特朗普重返推特的决定，马斯克用拉丁语短语写道：“民之声，神之声（Vox Populi, Vox Dei）”。在2021年1月6日美国国会山骚乱事件发生后，推特在其联合创始人兼时任CEO多尔西（Jack Dorsey）的领导下“永久封禁”了特朗普的8800万推特粉丝的推特账号。


据《华盛顿邮报》报导，特朗普周六在线上参加活动时谈到了马斯克发起的民意调查和他的推特账户主题。特朗普对重返推特平台的前景反应冷淡，重申了之前的言论，即他宁愿将注意力集中在他的克隆网站“Truth Social”上。


特朗普在谈到重返推特时说：“我看不出有什么理由，对于很多人来说Truth Social已经取代了（推特）的位置，我不认为他们会回到推特上”。虽然特朗普借机宣传自己的社交媒体平台，但他说自己很欣赏这次投票，并欢迎马斯克对推特的收购。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Fedora Workstation 37 是 Fedora Project 桌面操作系统的最新版本，由致力于推动开源创新的全球社区开发。本文介绍了 Fedora Workstation 37 中一些面向用户的新功能。现在就从 GNOME “软件Software”应用升级，或者在你最喜欢的终端模拟器中使用 dnf system-upgrade 升级！

GNOME 43

Fedora Workstation 37 具有最新版本的 GNOME 桌面环境，其中包含更多移植到 GTK 4 的核心应用、用户界面调整和性能调整。查看 GNOME 43 发行说明 了解更多信息！

重新设计的快速设置菜单



新的“快速设置Quick Settings”菜单提供更多控制和便利。你现在可以在菜单中轻松切换你的 Wi-Fi 网络，而不用进入全屏对话框；在默认模式和深色模式之间切换；以及在不打开“设置Settings”应用的情况下启用夜灯。现在还提供了一个方便的截屏和录屏按钮。

核心应用

Fedora Workstation 37 中包含的 GNOME 核心应用已经进行了一轮调整和改进：


“文件Files”应用已移植到 GTK 4，并且用户界面有许多改进。这里只是其中的一些：

它现在是自适应的，这意味着它会自动调整到更窄的尺寸，从而更好地利用可用空间。

列表视图已重新设计，使橡皮筋选择更容易。

重新设计了 “属性Properties” 和 “打开方式……Open With…” 对话框。 




“日历Calendar”应用有一个新的边栏，可以一目了然地显示即将发生的事件。它与“联系人Contacts”应用一起，现在具有自适应用户界面。

“角色Characters”应用现在会向你显示不同的肤色、头发颜色和表情符号的性别选项。

“软件Software” 中的包源选择器已重新设计并移至更显眼的位置。

“地图Maps”应用已移植到 GTK 4。

“设置Settings”应用包括一个新的“设备安全Device Security”面板，让你可以轻松查看你的设备提供或缺少的硬件安全功能！ 


新补充的默认壁纸

Fedora Workstation 37 附带一组新的补充壁纸。 在这里看看它们是如何制作的！



Fedora Linux 37 的底层变化

Fedora Linux 37 具有许多底层更改。以下是一些值得注意的：


现已正式支持树莓派 4 单板机，包括 3D 加速！

在 BIOS 系统上的新安装将使用 GPT 磁盘布局，而不是传统的 MBR 布局。在 BIOS 系统上，安装程序镜像现在还将使用 GRUB 而不是 syslinux 进行引导。

如果你禁用然后重新启用 SELinux，或运行 fixfiles onboot 命令，文件系统的重新标记过程现在将并行完成，从而显着提高速度。

波斯语的默认字体已从 DejaVu 和 Noto Sans Arabic 更改为 Vazirmatn，为在波斯语中使用 Fedora Linux 的用户提供更一致的体验。


还有这些...

Fedora 项目中发生的很酷的事情！


Fedora CoreOS 和 Fedora Cloud Base 已升级为 “版本Edition” 级别！

Fedora Linux 系统安装程序，带有新 GUI 的 Anaconda 预览安装程序镜像将在大约一周内可用。我将发布一篇文章以提供更多详细信息，敬请关注！

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[在本文中，我们将讨论网络连接最基本的诊断工具之一：ping 命令。




如今，联网计算机变得十分普遍，以至于我们大多数人都理所当然地认为，房间一侧的计算机可以连接上房间另一侧的计算机，更不用说能连接上世界的另一端的计算机了。如此，网络使互联网、云、文件共享、媒体流、远程管理、打印等服务成为可能。但是当网络出现问题时，有时很难诊断到底是其中哪一环节出现了问题。下面，我们就来介绍：网络连接最基本的诊断工具之一—— ping 命令。

基本的 ping 命令

当你无法访问本地网络上的计算机或互联网上的服务器时，你可以 ping 它的 IP 地址。ping 将 互联网控制报文协议Internet Control Message Protocol（ICMP）数据包发送到目标 IP 地址。当我们要对网路连接状况进行判断时，ICMP 是个非常有用的协议，本质上 ICMP 是一个响应和应答信号。

让我们由近及远地进行故障排除。请先 ping 你自己的计算机，以确保你的计算机正在运行 网络栈networking stack。你正在操作的计算机称为 主机localhost，本地回环地址是：127.0.0.1。

ping 命令能用主机的 主机名 hostname、IP 地址（即 127.0.0.1）或者仅仅用简写 0 来表示 “主机”。

你可以使用 -c 选项，来控制发送数据包的 次数count。

$ ping 0 -c 1
PING 0 (127.0.0.1) 56(84) bytes of data.
64 bytes from 127.0.0.1: icmp_seq=1 ttl=64 time=0.069 ms

Thanks in advance.

 Maybe certificates, contributing, or administrating servers? I already do administrate a bunch of arch and proxmox servers and I've been using arch on desktop since about a year, contributing code sounds very fun, I'm especially interested in low level development. Certificates bore the hell out of me though.
 By the way, I don't want to land a job at a shitty place like Microsoft or Google, I just want to be useful.

I don't know much about these tools though, besides that they are used mostly in resource-constrained systems.
 I was interested in learning a bit more about the differences between the *box and *base projects, and if there are any advantages or disadvantages on a full desktop environment.

11 月 15 日，Meta 公司发布了一个名为 Galactica 的新的大型语言模型。它是一个用于科学的大型语言模型，由 4800 万篇科学文章、网站文章、教科书、讲义和维基等训练而成。Meta 公司将其模型宣传为研究人员和学生的捷径，说它“可以总结学术论文，解决数学问题，生成维基文章，编写科学代码，为分子和蛋白质做注解，等等。”但是，像所有的语言模型一样，Galactica 只是一个无意识的机器人，无法区分事实与虚构。几小时内，科学家们就在社交媒体上分享了它有偏见和不正确的结果。三天后，Meta 撤下了它的在线演示版本。

国际固态电路会议（ISSCC）将于明年初在旧金山举行。据会议委员会称，本次会议通过了筛选的 198 篇论文中有 59 篇来自中国，42 篇来自美国，32 篇来自韩国。中国论文数从第三位上升到第一位，中国在每个类别的入选研究论文数量都有所增加。ISSCC 于 1954 年首次举行，它是该领域最大和最著名的国际会议。

对多因素认证的攻击正在增加

三年前，针对多因素认证（MFA）的攻击非常罕见，因为很少有机构启用 MFA。但随着微软、谷歌等开始推行多因素认证，对它的攻击开始增加。在这些攻击中，攻击者破坏了发给已经完成多因素认证的人的令牌，并复制该令牌以获得不同设备的访问。令牌是 OAuth 2.0 身份平台的核心，其目的是使用户的身份验证更简单、更快速，并能抵御密码攻击。微软的检测和响应团队发现攻击者为此目的利用令牌盗窃的情况有所增加。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[本教程讲述了在 Ubuntu 和其他 Linux 系统中安装 FFmpeg 所需的步骤。


FFmpeg 是一系列用于操作多媒体文件的库和软件程序。整个 FFmpeg 是一组强大的库，允许你转换、推流和操作音频和视频文件。许多前端 Linux 应用程序将其用作后端并依赖它。例如，屏幕录制应用程序可能需要 FFmpeg 将录制的流转换为 Gif 图像。

主流的应用程序和服务，如 VLC 媒体播放器、YouTube、Blender、Kodi、Shotcut 和 Handbrake 等，都使用 FFmpeg。


趣事：NASA 2020 年发射的毅力号火星探测器使用 FFmpeg 完成和处理图像和视频，然后将其发送回地球！


关于 FFmpeg 包

FFmped 是一个强大的命令行工具。它支持 Linux、Windows 和 macOS，并支持多种架构。它是用 C 和汇编编写的，提供了强大的性能和跨平台实用性。

核心

FFmpeg 的核心是命令行实用程序。它们可以在命令行上使用，也可以从任何编程语言中调用。例如，你可以从 Shell 程序、Python 脚本等程序中使用它们。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[使用这个开源工具，即使是批量校正图像也很容易。


多年前，在翻阅一家旧书店的书架上的内容时，我偶然发现了一本名为 《UNIX System Command Summary for Berkeley 4.2 & 4.3 BSD》 的小册子，由 Specialized Systems Consultants 出版。我买它是出于好奇，因为它已经有将近 20 年的历史了，但仍然在很大程度上适用于现代 Linux 和 BSD。

无论是当时还是现在，我都很开心。一本写于 1986 年的小册子在 2016 年仍然很重要，而同一个书架上关于专有操作系统的书籍并不值得印刷它们的纸张。（想一想：你认为什么技术可以在僵尸末日中幸存下来？）这本小册子已经放在我自己的书架上好几年了，但我突然想到可能值得对这个作品做一点数字保存，所以我决定扫描这本小册子来创建一本 CBZ 电子书。

使用 Skanlite 进行扫描很容易，但很耗时。然而，当我完成后，我发现有些页面不是很平整。



在打印中，这称为配准问题，这意味着打印内容的位置在页面上的方向不正确。

ImageMagick

ImageMagick 是基于终端的非交互式图形编辑器。尝试在无图形环境（如纯文本终端）中编辑图形似乎违反直觉，但实际上很常见。例如，当你将图像上传到 Web 应用用作个人资料图片时，应用服务器上的脚本可能会使用 ImageMagick 或其库处理你的图像。非交互式编辑器的优点是你可以制定需要对示例图像执行的操作，然后只需按一下按钮即可将这些效果应用于数百个其他图像。

ImageMagick 通常与其他图形编辑器一样强大，只要你花时间了解它的许多功能以及如何组合它们以实现所需的效果。在这种情况下，我想旋转歪斜的页面。在搜索了 ImageMagick 的文档后，我发现我需要的解决方案的 ImageMagick 术语称为纠偏。将你的术语与其他人的术语保持一致对于你不知道的任何事情都是一个挑战，因此当你使用 ImageMagick（或其他任何东西）时，请记住，你描述问题或解决方案的用词可能和别人不一样。

要使用 ImageMagick 对带有弯曲文本的图像进行校正：

$ convert page_0052.webp -deskew25% fix_0052.webp


-deskew 选项表示可接受偏差的阈值。通过跟踪看似字母的对象的峰谷来确定倾斜。根据扫描的弯曲程度，你可能需要多于或少于 25% 的阈值。我已经达到了 80%，到目前为止，低于 25% 没用效果。

结果如下：



修复了！将其应用于文档的剩余 55 页以修复倾斜的页面，而对已经笔直的页面不做任何事情。换句话说，由于我的阈值设置，在不需要调整的页面上运行此命令是安全的。

使用 ImageMagick 裁剪图像

在纠正了歪斜之后，因为我扫描每一页都比必要的范围要多，以防止意外切断单词，我认为裁剪我纠正的页面是有意义的。我很高兴在页边空白处保留一些空间，但没有以前那么多。我经常使用 ImageMagick 的“裁剪”功能来处理这个网站上的图像，所以我很熟悉这个选项。但是，我需要确定如何裁剪每一页。

首先，我需要图像的大小：

$ identify fixed_0052.webp
WEBP 1128x2593 1128x2593+0+08-bit sRGB 114732B 0.020u 0:00.021


知道尺寸后，我能够对我可以承受的丢失多少像素做出一些估计。经过几次试运行，我得到了这个：

convert fix_0052.webp -gravity Center -crop 950x2450+0+0 crop_0052.webp


这并不完全适合，但当我将它应用于册子中的其他图像时，它被证明很重要。这些页面的内容和扫描仪位置各不相同，所以我很高兴给每一页一点空余空间。

这是校正和裁剪的图像：



使用开源批量编辑图像

ImageMagick 的美妙之处在于，当你确定了修复图像的公式，你就可以将该修复应用于需要相同修复的所有图像。我使用 GNU Parallel 执行此操作，它使用我所有的 CPU 内核来完成数百页的图像校正。这并不需要很长时间，而且结果不言而喻。更重要的是，我已经有了一个 UNIX 历史上有趣作品的数字档案。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[美国司法部在11月16日的新闻发布会上表示，两名俄罗斯国民，33岁的安东·纳波斯基（Anton Napolsky）和27岁的瓦莱莉雅·埃尔马科娃（Valeriia Ermakova）于11月3日在阿根廷科尔多瓦被捕。这两名俄罗斯公民被指控侵犯版权、电信诈骗和洗钱。同时，美国政府查封并关闭了Z-Library的249个在线域名，并撤除了该网站。


联邦检察官表示，Z-Library自2009年创建以来提供超过1100万本电子书供读者下载，但该网站提供的许多电子书受知识产权保护。


“被告从他们偷来的作品中非法获利，经常在作品出版几小时后就上传，在这个过程中，作者、出版商和书商受害，”纽约布鲁克林的司法部检察官布伦·皮斯(Breon Peace)说。


网站所有者通过捐款和收取部分访问费用，建立了一个由249个网站域名组成的网络，并通过一个易于访问的主页将它们链接起来，从而避免了多次封锁和关闭。


Z-Library，通常被称为z-lib，在许多国家因侵犯版权而受到法律攻击。


2022年8月，法国出版商联盟(French Publishers Union)称这些网站对出版业构成了严重威胁，并赢得了在法国封锁Z-Library网站的法院命令。


在去年的一份法庭文件中，美国作家协会(US Authors Guild)表示，Z-Library“可能是世界上最受瞩目、流量最大的图书盗版网站”。


美国作家协会表示，Z-Library与主要的合法下载服务一起出现在常规的网络搜索中，因此它们看起来是合法的。


停刊令世界各地的读者感到沮丧，包括许多学生在网上抱怨说，他们无法负担z图书馆提供的教科书的商业价格。


尼日利亚数字营销专家阿德瑞诺拉·阿约米德(Aderinola Ayomide)在脸书上写道：“使用这个网站的主要是那些买不起昂贵课本的学生、从事研究和撰写文章的人。”


菲律宾的卡莱尔·德拉·佩纳(Karyle Dela Pena)在脸书上写道，“Z-Library是我下载天体物理学教科书的唯一途径”，因为它们的成本通常很高。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[这些年来，我通过这些开源资源提高了我的 Python 技能。


我最近决定进一步学习 Python，以便提高我的教学技能，拓宽我的学生的视野。在这个过程中，我发现了这些优秀的资源，让我学习新的代码，并提高了对 Python 的整体理解。

1、《教孩子学编程 Python 语言版》

我的 Python 之旅大约是 7 年前开始的，当时我发现了 Apple LOGO 和 Python 中的 Turtle 模块 之间的联系。当时使用的 Linux 计算机的默认 Python 版本为 Python 2.7，我很快发现我想使用 Python 3。我成功地安装了它，并开始使用 Turtle 模块编写一些简单的程序。在阅读 Dr. Bryson Payne 的 《教孩子学编程 Python 语言版》 之后，我意识到 Python 不仅仅是 Turtle。那时我安装了 IDLE。

2、IDLE

在使用 IDLE 工作的过程中，交互式界面优化了我的体验，并让我有足够的信心来考虑向学生教授 Python。我志愿帮助我社区中的一群在家学习的孩子，很快我发现自己在教授一个有十六个孩子的班级！我很高兴他们的父母同意帮助我，否则我想我会被压垮。这个经历激发了我学习更多的欲望，以便我可以教授更多。

3.、Mu 编辑器

2018 年春天，我参加了 PyConUS。我听了一场由中学老师 Nicholas Tollervey 主讲的演讲，他为学龄前儿童编写了一个 Python 开发环境。Mu 编辑器 内置了一个可以帮助我找到代码中的错误的 质检工具Linter。Mu 帮助我提高了我的编码技能，我也能够与学生分享这些技能，他们也从中受益。

我的自信和经验增长后，我希望与更多的学生分享 Python 之旅。我与其他人合作撰写了一个申请书，以教授一个使用树莓派 4 和 Python 的课程。疫情打断了这个计划。在此期间，树莓派基金会发布了树莓派 400。2021 年春天，我使用了前一年开发的材料和一个来自当地图书馆的慷慨的资助，来 教授两组 学生如何编程。这个活动非常成功并在今年再次举办。

4、Codium

几年前，我了解到微软的 VS Code 是一个可以在 Linux 上使用的开源代码编辑器。我最近才了解到，如何在 VS Code 中配置和使用 Python 虚拟环境。我的问题在一篇 关于虚拟环境的文章 中得到了解答，这让我可以知道如何在 Linux 计算机上设置和配置 Python 虚拟环境。大约在同一时间，我发现了 Codium，一个围绕 VS Code 构建的社区项目。

现在我希望与我的学生分享 VS Codium 的体验，并让他们对 Python 的理解不再局限于 Turtle 模块。这种学习的热情让我寻找开源且可以在互联网上随意获得的教学资源。

5、《Python 编程练习，简单解释》

《Python 编程快速上手 让繁琐工作自动化》 这本书是我最喜欢的一本书。现在，作者已经发布了 《Python 编程练习，简单解释》。这两本书都可以免费在线阅读，并且都采用了知识共享许可证。

6、《每个人都可以使用 Python》

Dr. Charles Severance 在 2017 年发布了 《每个人都可以使用 Python》，我非常推荐这本书。他为像我这样的有抱负的程序员提供了简短的课程。课程的代码可以在 GitHub 上找到，所以你可以下载它并在自己的计算机或学校网络上安装它。

7. Python 视频

最近，我了解到 Jay LaCroix 在 YouTube 上有一系列精彩的视频，其中包括 28 个免费视频，从 Python 基础开始，涵盖了 Python 编程 的全面介绍。最重要的是，他使用的是 Linux 计算机，因此他的课程特别适合 Linux 编程环境。这些视频的其中一个收获是学习如何使用 nano 作为编程环境，它默认情况下包含在大多数 Linux 发行版中。

你的学习之路

此处提到的这七个资源帮助我成长为一名程序员，它们都是开源的并可以与其他人分享。你是如何提高编程技能的？你有什么要分享的吗？在评论中告诉我们。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[For many years now I have been using Linux, but I still qualify myself as a newbie, always assuming that I know much less than the person answering my question when asking questions about some topic. On one side I see that I now know much more than when I for the first time installed Ubuntu LTS 12.04, on the other, I know that I have never used some functionalities that are considered advanced knowledge. 
 My flavor of choice is Debian at the moment. I do not regret switching from Ubuntu. I find it to be simpler to use and solve problems, also help topics while rarer, are more to a point, and more helpful than those found for Ubuntu earlier. 
 Recently I have found out that I am now able to solve most problems with the use of the internet without having to ask a question. On the other hand, I have never compiled a program from a source or made a bash script other than some simple automation to add some folder structure. For a few months now I am running a small homelab which worked out better than expected. 
 There are topics to be learned, which are not really Linux knowledge (DNS, networking, ...) that Microsoft managed under the hood, but a Linux user must know more to be able to successfully configure it, but that's another story. 
 TLDR: Searching for a tool to assess my Linux knowledge. I am not really considering a certification exam, but that might also be an option, some cheaper one that won't break the bank while still being useful. I am looking for some self-assess tools (like language questionnaires). 
 Also, it might be time for some deeper knowledge, so resources (a book or a course) about Linux in depth would be helpful too.

at the discussion around the GNU Tools Infrastructure proposal.


	Sourceware, a volunteer group that has been supporting various
	critical FOSS developer tools for more than two decades, is being
	courted by The Linux Foundation's Open Source Security Foundation
	(OpenSSF). The OpenSSF aims to improve open source software
	security by providing Sourceware projects with more modern IT
	infrastructure.

	But some members of the Sourceware community fear that accepting
	the help of the OpenSSF would give the corporate Linux world more
	leverage over FOSS developer tools. They would prefer to seek
	support from the Software Freedom Conservancy, a charitable
	non-profit that they believe is better aligned with software
	freedom.

 Can someone please share how linux rose to dominance over unix? From what I understand the emergence of the x86 chips made the hardware servers more scalable and there’s the attraction of open source software plus free. But what’s the reason behind the scale of the shift in preferred OS?
 Also is there any known competitor to linux now such that linux might be replaced and follow the path of unix? Thanks for your insights

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[一半的 macOS 恶意软件都来自一个“杀毒软件”

Elastic 安全实验室发现，一半 macOS 恶意软件来自 MacKeeper。讽刺的是，MacKeeper 声称 “以零努力保持你的 Mac 清洁和安全”。该程序可以被威胁者滥用，因为它有广泛的权限和对进程和文件的访问。这意味着，一个旨在保持 Mac 安全不受网络威胁的程序可能使你的系统处于危险之中。 MacKeeper 也以难以完全卸载而著称。然而，Mac 仍然是恶意软件最少的操作系统，研究发现只有 6.2% 的恶意软件出现在 macOS 上，而 Windows 和 Linux 上则分别为 54.4% 和 39.4%。


消息来源：Neowin



老王点评：这可真够讽刺的，一个杀毒软件反而是最大的黑窝。




开源推动 5G 占据了 50% 的电信市场

5G 部署现在已经超过 50% 的电信市场规模，这得益于开源。Linux 基金会称，在这一切的背后，“是向开放网络和框架的彻底转变。无论经济和政治风向如何，这种转变都在继续。事实上，开源可能是唯一没有受到影响的领域，因为它有能力跨越国界和边界来做需要做的事情。”据一些分析师的说法，到 2030 年，5G 的经济价值将达到 7 万亿美元。


消息来源：ZDNet



老王点评：开源居然对 5G 的推广有这么大的作用，这是有些想不到。




Mozilla 收入更多样，但仍然主要依靠谷歌

Mozilla 今天发布了其年度《Mozilla 状况》报告，2021 年，Mozilla 公司从搜索合作、订阅和广告收入中获得了 5.85 亿美元，比前一年增长了 25%。除了主要来自谷歌的搜索合作的收入之外，来自 Mozilla VPN、Mozilla MDN Plus、Pocket 等新产品的收入为 5700 万美元，与前一年相比增长了 125%。


消息来源：Tech Crunch



老王点评：虽然 Mozilla 也有一些让人批评的地方，但是这已经是自由开源世界不多的重要旗舰了。]]></summary>

        <updated>2022-11-18T03:30:31.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[本文讲述如何一步步在 Linux 上安装 AWS CLI（命令行工具）。


AWS CLI 是一个能够和 AWS 账户进行交互的命令行程序。开发者和系统管理员用它管理日常的活动和自动化。

准备环节


安装好的 Linux 系统

具有管理员权限的 sudo 账户

能够联网


现在让我们开始安装：

1、下载安装文件

打开终端使用 curl 命令下载 AWS CLI 的安装文件：

$ curl "https://awscli.amazonaws.com/awscli-exe-linux-x86_64.zip" -o "awscliv2.zip"




以上命令会在当前工作目录下载一个 awscliv2.zip 的文件。

使用 ls 命令 确认当前下载下来的文件：

$ ls -l awscliv2.zip
-rw-rw-r-- 1 linuxtechi linuxtechi 47244662 Oct 20 10:53 awscliv2.zip
$


2、解压缩下载的文件

使用 unzip 命令 解压安装包：

$ unzip awscliv2.zip


它会在当前目录创建一个 aws 文件夹，把解压好的文件放进去：

$ ls -ld aws
drwxr-xr-x 3 linuxtechi linuxtechi 4096 Oct 19 17:18 aws
$


3、运行安装脚本

使用以下命令运行安装脚本：

$ sudo ./aws/install




脚本会把所有安装的文件放到 /usr/local/aws-cli 目录下，然后创建一个链接文件到 /usr/local/bin 目录。

4、检查 AWS CLI 的版本

运行以下脚本检查版本：

$ aws --version
aws-cli/2.8.4 Python/3.9.11 Linux/5.15.0-48-generic exe/x86_64.ubuntu.22 prompt/off
$


5、配置 AWS CLI

为了验证 AWS CLI 是否安装正确，开始配置 AWS CLI：

登录你的 AWS 管理控制台，取得 AWS 访问密钥 IDAccess Key ID 和 安全访问密钥Secret Access Key。

如果还没完成创建，请先创建，并把它们复制到安全的地方。



然后回到命令行，运行以下命令：

$ aws configure
AWS Access Key ID [None]: xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
AWS Secret Access Key [None]: xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
Default region name [None]: us-west-2
Default output format [None]: json
$


以上的证书会被保存到这个文件：

$ cat  ~/.aws/credentials


上面的命令的输出：



运行 aws 命令列出你账户中的 s3 储存和 VPC：

$ aws s3 ls
$ aws ec2 describe-vpcs


输出如下：



成功输出内容，说明你的 AWS CLI 已经配置完成。

这就是这篇文章的全部内容，请在下面的评论区发表你的疑问和反馈。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[这篇文章能让你了解如何使用 Checksec ，来识别一个可执行文件的安全属性，了解安全属性的含义，并知道如何使用它们。




编译源代码会生成一个二进制文件（LCTT 译注：即 .o 文件）。在编译期间，你可以向 gcc 编译器提供 标志flags，以启用或禁用二进制文件的某些属性，这些属性与安全性相关。

Checksec 是一个漂亮的小工具，同时它也是一个 shell 脚本。Checksec 可以识别编译时构建到二进制文件中的安全属性。编译器可能会默认启用一些安全属性，你也可以提供特定的标志，来启用其他的安全属性。

本文将介绍如何使用 Checksec ，来识别二进制文件的安全属性，包括：


Checksec 在查找有关安全属性的信息时，使用了什么底层的命令

在将源代码编译成二进制文件时，如何使用GNU 编译器套件GNU Compiler Collection（即 GCC）来启用安全属性。


安装 checksec

要在 Fedora 和其他基于 RPM 的 Linux 系统上，安装 Checksec，请使用以下命令：

$ sudo dnf install checksec


对于基于 Debian 的 Linux 发行版，使用对应的 apt 命令，来安装 Checksec。

$ sudo apt install checksec


shell 脚本

在安装完 Checksec 后，能够发现 Checksec 是一个单文件的 shell 脚本，它位于 /usr/bin/checksec，并且这个文件挺大的。Checksec 的一个优点是你可以通过快速通读这个 shell 脚本，从而了解 Checksec 的执行原理、明白所有能查找有关二进制文件或可执行文件的安全属性的系统命令：

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, I was thinking how (title) would be possible to do with least effort and i thought "would be nice if PATH was a function or some kind of pythonish @property ". I didn't want to write any function that would add my pwd to the path when i cd to it and then remove it when i change working dir again. And I didn't find anything useful while searching google for temporary path change (maybe i just can't "play prompt" uell).
 So i tried just binding function to PATH and it... worked?
 export PATH=$PATH:$pwd 
 I don't quite understand why it works, because _nothing_ is changed in PATH variable when I print it using env (maybe because it's bash builtin?) but it always searches PWD as if it was in PATH and I'm kinda happy it required no effort to setup. Sharing, maybe some ppl didn't know of such trick just as I didn't.

We are selling standalone boring, mainly desktop (although it runs on beefier laptops as well) software. It's for Windows and written in boring technologies (C99 for the engine and C# for GUI).
We are considering various business models when it comes to selling it in the future as our current one causes a lot of problems. Some options and thoughts I have about them right now:
1)What I call a "classical model" which we tried so far: release 1.0 version, sell it for a fixed price. Continue to support it for a while with bugfixes/features. At some point move to developing 2.0 version, sell it again (giving discounts for current 1.0 customers).
Advantages: simple, the customers can use software they purchased forever
Disadvantages: at some point you need to start collecting features…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The “charger_manager” kernel thread is created by a freezable workqueue https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/latest/source/drivers/power/supply/charger-manager.c#L1749) . Freezable workqueues are basically frozen when the system is moved to a suspend state (https://lwn.net/Articles/403891/).
 Based on the kernel source code “charger_manager” is responsible for monitoring the health (like temperature monitoring) of the battery and controlling the charger while the system is suspended to memory (https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/latest/source/drivers/power/supply/charger-manager.c) . Also, the “Charger Manager” kernel module is written by MyungJoo Ham. (https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/latest/source/drivers/power/supply/charger-manager.c#L1768).
 Moreover, the kernel documentation states that the “Charger Manager’’ also helps in giving an aggregated view to userspace in case they are multiple chargers for a battery. In case they are multiple batteries with different chargers on a system, that system would need multiple instances of “Charger Manager” (https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/v5.3/power/charger-manager.html) .
 On my Ubuntu VM (22.04.1 LTS) this kernel module is not compiled as a separate “*.ko” file. It is compiled into the kernel itself (builtin), as you can see in the output of “modinfo” in the screenshot below.
 charger_manager is a builtin kernel module (Ubuntu 22.04.1 LTS)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I often find some bit of interesting software and install it test for a week or two. Frequently, I end up changing something in defaults, whether theme or some other parameter, and this drops a config into my $XDG_CONFIG_HOME where the program supports it and just $HOME if not. There is a similar, but less noticeable, effect happening in $XDG_DATA_HOME and $XDG_CACHE_HOME.
 When I later remove the software after determining unsuitability or just general dislike, I'm left with an orphaned config file. I usually forget to purge it when I remove the program. This means I have a lot of orphaned configs files.
 Recently, I've taken to doing my testing in distrobox podman containers to more easily ensure that software, and ~all~ dependencies, get purged on un-install, but this does nothing for user-config files. I could re-train myself to be better about seek-n-destroying configs on software removal. Likewise, I could use a dotfiles manager to mark the configs I definitely want to keep and then set up a cron job to nuke $XDG_CONFIG_HOME and reload my "keepers." I really feel like have a program to scan my config-dirs and compare against installed user-space applications for autoremoval of orphaned configs is perhaps the better way to go. I also am fully aware of the challenges involved in writing such software.
 Nonetheless, and finally, the question:
 Is there already a program for cleaning up orphaned software-config files from $HOME?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[To make it easier to make Linux a target for native application development, why not just have a library that wraps the "native" UI toolkit of whatever DE you're using? Every toolkit could host their own (or have one created by the community), and any application that is built on it would automatically theme correctly and feel completely at home due to using the DE's standard widget kit under the hood.
 ​
 Older applications wouldn't draw in a ton of deps from an old UI kit, newer apps could work on older systems, etc. Of course this wouldn't be without drawbacks. The lowest denominator between all common toolkits would have to be used, making it fairly limited, but it might be a good option for simpler applications.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[通过安全的网络连接在远程计算机上调用命令或程序。


有一天，我正在测试如何在 将文件或目录复制到多个位置和系统时保持完整的文件权限。当我想检查远程系统上的文件权限时，我必须通过 SSH 登录它并检查属性。从远程系统多次登录和注销的过程让我有点烦，我想，如果我可以在远程 Linux 系统上通过 SSH 执行命令就好了。

幸运的是，在浏览了 ssh 命令的手册页后，我找到了一个解决办法。

如果你想知道如何本地运行远程系统上运行命令或脚本，而不登录到远程系统，下面的内容会告诉你如何做。

1、通过 SSH 在远程 Linux 系统上执行命令

从本地系统通过 SSH 在远程系统上运行命令或脚本的典型方法是：

$ ssh <username@IP_Address-or-Doman_name> <Command-or-Script>


允许我给你们举几个例子：

1.1、通过 SSH 在远程系统上运行单个命令

假设你想要 查找远程 Linux 系统的内核详细信息。为此，只需运行：

$ ssh sk@192.168.225.22 uname -a


这里，


sk 是远程系统的用户名，

192.168.225.22 是远程系统的 IP 地址，

uname -a 是我想在远程系统上运行的命令。


示例输出：



看到没？我并没有实际登录到远程系统，但通过 SSH 在远程系统上执行了 uname 命令，并在本地系统的终端上显示了输出。

你还可以像下面这样用引号指定命令。

$ ssh sk@192.168.225.22 "uname -a"


或者，

$ ssh sk@192.168.225.22 'uname -a'


如果你已经 更改了 SSH 协议的默认端口，只需使用 -p 参数指定它。

意大利移动应用开发商 Bending Spoons 公司今天宣布收购印象笔记（Evernote）。在收购的新闻稿中说，“印象笔记拥有约 1 亿美元的经常性收入，数百万付费客户，以及使用其跨平台应用程序创建的近 110 亿条笔记。”印象笔记曾经是最流行的笔记应用之一，但在 2016 年开始限制免费用户的使用。在同一年还宣布开发了可以审查用户笔记的 AI，以及让其员工可以访问用户笔记，虽然在招致巨大反对后取消了计划，但也导致了大量用户流失。如今，在 iOS 上，它甚至没有跻身生产力应用程序的前 100 名。收购宣告没有公开收购金额等细节。

AlmaLinux 9.1 紧随 RHEL 9.1 发布

红帽企业 Linux（RHEL）9.1 今天正式发布，RHEL 9.1 将 PHP 8.1 作为支持的应用流，扩展了多级安全支持，支持将容器嵌入到镜像构建器蓝图中等等一系列更新增强。而仅仅半天后，作为 RHEL 9.1 的自由构建版本，AlmaLinux 9.1 就发布了。

老王点评：我觉得 CentOS 的结束至少有一个好处，RHEL 的自由版本发布的更快了，以前都需要几周。




KDE 宣布新的社区目标：可访问性、环境可持续性、自动化

消息来源：Phoronix



老王点评：我还是觉得之前的目标更务实一些，目前的 KDE 虽然已经很棒了，但是距离最好还有一些距离。

        <link href="https://www.williamlong.info/archives/6995.html"/>
        <updated>2022-11-17T05:18:13.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[11月17日，动视暴雪（简称暴雪）投资者官网发布消息称，由于与网易公司的现行许可协议将于2023年1月23日到期，将暂停在中国大部分暴雪游戏服务。包括魔兽世界、炉石传说、魔兽争霸III：重制版、守望先锋、星际争霸系列、暗黑破坏神 III和风暴英雄。


《暗黑破坏神：不朽》的共同开发和发行则涉及两家公司另外的单独协议。暴雪总裁迈克 伊巴拉（Mike Ybarra）表示，公司正寻找替代方案。2008年8月，暴雪与网易达成代理协议，此后多次续约，双方累计合作长达14年。


“近20年来，我们一直通过网易和其他合作伙伴将我们的游戏带到中国，我们非常感谢中国社区展现出的热情，”暴雪总裁迈克 伊巴拉（Mike Ybarra）表示，“他们的热情和创造力激励着我们，我们正在寻找替代方案，以便在未来将我们的游戏带回给玩家。”


11月17日上午，网易港股跌超10%。


对此，网易方面在接受《证券日报》记者采访时表示，“网易一直在尽最大努力和动视暴雪公司谈判，希望推进续约。经过长时间的谈判，我们仍然无法就一些合作的关键性条款与动视暴雪达成一致。我们非常遗憾动视暴雪在今天先行宣布了停止合作，我们将不得不接受此决定。网易将继续履行职责，为我们的玩家服务到最后一刻。”


对于玩家游戏资产处理，网易回应称，公司后续会发声明通知玩家，以玩家公告为准，具体情况目前不方便透露。


关于暴雪与网易的续约风波，据观察者网援引知情人士报道，暴雪方针对续约提出的条件包括，暴雪方分成较2019-2022合约期50%以上营收和净利润提高，暴雪还要求网易按照《暗黑破坏神：不朽》模式，研发暴雪其他IP手游全球发行，但网易只享有中国区市场营收分成。同时，暴雪还要求网易缴纳巨额保证金或预付费用来担保第2条的完成，否则将被“处罚”。


据“界面新闻”报道，有接近暴雪中国的人士向其透露，“要求网易打白工”的说法不实。观察者网的报道所述三点均明显不符实际：在分成上，暴雪并未狮子大开口，要求进一步大幅提高分成比例 ；而在游戏定价收费上，暴雪也未要求网易执行全球同步策略，即在中国区提价。


在双方停止合作后，若暴雪想要更换中国代理商，则需要面临正在运营的游戏的版号需要调整的问题。北京元合律师事务所合伙人、游戏法专家孙磊向记者表示，如果《魔兽世界》《炉石传说》等游戏因为本次授权合约到期而停服，那么就意味着此前其取得的版号作废；但如果暴雪找到了新的合作商，且网易愿意提供配合，那么做好变更登记后，原有的版号仍可沿用。


据了解，此前网易与暴雪共同成立了上海网之易网络科技发展有限公司，致力于暴雪旗下《魔兽世界》《星际争霸2》等游戏在中国大陆的运营，相关游戏的电竞赛事组织运营也由网之易主导，据业内人士透露，网之易公司内部员工存在分别隶属于网易和暴雪的两套班底。


暴雪对网易正式发出“分手函”后，其下一个代理商将花落谁家，成为了资本市场和游戏圈颇为关注的话题。“目前可以透露的是，有不止一家国内游戏厂商在争夺暴雪在中国的代理权，但暴雪似乎还没有做出最后的选择。”一位不愿具名的游戏公司员工表示。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[路透社报道，推特新老板马斯克(Elon Musk)在一封电子邮件中告诉员工，他们必须决定是否愿意留下并“在高强度下长时间工作”，或者接受离职补偿。在发出这一最后通牒之前，马斯克已在本月早些时候解雇了这家社交媒体公司大约一半的员工。


根据《华尔街日报》看到的这封电邮，员工必须在美东时间周四下午5点前填写一份谷歌表格，表明他们是否愿意留在Twitter，接受高强度的工作。


马斯克前夜在一封电子邮件中写道：“今后，为了打造出一个突破性的Twitter 2.0，并在一个竞争日益激烈的世界中取得成功，我们需要采取非常硬核的工作态度。这将意味着在高强度下长时间工作。只有出色的表现才能取得合格的成绩。”





在发出这封电邮之前，马斯克上周给员工发了一份备忘录，警告说公司面临严峻的经济挑战，他在备忘录中说破产是一种可能性。《华尔街日报》看到了这份备忘录。另据知情人士透露，同样在上周，马斯克在10月底接管Twitter后的首次全体员工会议上谈到了结束大多数员工的远程工作选项，这位亿万富豪称，员工需要在条件允许的情况下回到办公室上班。


推特近期刚无预警解雇约4400合约员工，以及近3700全职员工。


马斯克认为，推特是他以出售155亿美元（约212亿新元）特斯拉（Tesla）持股，以及承担数以10亿计美元债务的代价而“拯救”的公司。因此，在经济不景气下，如果推特不开始赚更多钱，公司就可能破产。他也要求员工停止居家办公，且每周工作80小时。

在过去几年内，我有幸和中学生们一起，并带他们入门 Python 开发 和树莓派 400。这一切都很有趣，树莓派对于学生和我来说都是一个很好的平台。我们使用了 Code with Mu，并且一切都很成功。我们的 Python 技能随着经验的增长而增长，因此最近我开始寻找给这些学生提供更多东西的方法。

我参与了一个 Python 课程并在课程中接触了微软的 Visual Studio Code。我在课程中学到了很多关于如何为 Python 设置虚拟环境，以及如何为 Python 编程配置 VS Code 的知识。在学习过程中，我也认识了 Codium，它基本上是没有微软品牌和遥测的 VS Code。

如果你正在寻找一个优秀的、通用的、开源的、带有 Python 集成的代码编辑器，那么你可以尝试一下 Codium。下面是我在 Linux 系统上为 Python 设置 Codium 的方法。

在 Linux 上安装或更新 Python

首先，确保你正在运行最新版本的 Python。你可以使用你的软件包管理器来完成这项工作。在 Debian 和基于 Debian 的系统上：

$ sudo apt install python3-pip


在 Fedora、CentOS、Mageia、OpenMandriva 和类似的系统上：

$ sudo dnf update python3


在某些系统上，你可能还需要安装创建 Python 虚拟环境的软件：

$ sudo apt install python3.10-venv


安装 Codium

接下来，在你的电脑上 安装 Codium。在 Linux 上，你可以下载一个包…]]></summary>

        <updated>2022-11-17T01:22:31.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[在这篇文章中，我们将逐步解释如何在 RHEL 9 系统上安装 Node.js。


Node.js 基于谷歌的 V8 JavaScript 引擎构建，它是一个自由开源的跨平台 JavaScript 运行时环境，主要用于构建服务器端应用。它使用事件驱动和异步模型，帮助开发人员构建高度可扩展的数据密集型的实时应用（RTA）。你可以使用 NodeJS 来构建前端和后端应用。

Node.js 通常用于构建以下应用：


聊天应用

流媒体应用

浏览器游戏

命令行工具

嵌入式系统


在其技术栈中使用 NodeJS 的顶级公司包括 PayPal、NetFlix 和 Uber 等等。

安装 Node.js 主要有以下三种方式：


从 NodeSource 仓库安装 Node.js

从发行版的官方仓库安装 Node.js

使用 NVM 安装 Node.js


让我们看看如何使用这些方法在 RHEL 9 上安装 Node.js。

先决条件：


最小化安装的 RHEL 9 系统

具有管理员权限的 sudo 用户

互联网连接

Red Hat 订阅或本地配置的仓库


从 NodeSource 存储库安装 Node.js

NodeSource 是一家技术公司，旨在帮助组织运行生产就绪的 Node.js 应用，关注资源使用以及增强的安全性和应用程序性能。它提供了最新版本的 Node.js 和 NPM。

要从 NodeSource 安装 Node.js，首先，按如下所示更新系统包。

$ sudo dnf update -y




接下来，安装这期间所需的构建工具。其中包括 GCC C/C++ 编译器、Perl 和 Python 调试器等等。

$ sudo dnf groupinstall 'Dev…]]></summary>

it does 
and how it does it, but PJ Waskiewicz of Jump Trading came to the Netdev 0x16 conference to try
to demystify some of that, especially with respect to its use of
networking.  He 
wanted to contrast the needs of HFT with those of the traditional networking
as it is used outside of the HFT space.  He also has some thoughts on what
the Linux kernel could do to help address those needs so that HFT companies
could move away from some of the custom code that is currently being

Our mission is to make the world's code safe, performant and reliable. We're starting with a tool to catch JavaScript regressions in web applications with zero-effort from developers.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello all. Apologies if this is the wrong forum. If so, please redirect me.
 I am trying to run the Windows Powershell binary in Linux. There is a native Powershell available for Linux, but the available libraries for Linux PS differ from those available in Windows. E.g., some tools for ActiveDirectory and Excel are not available under Linux.
 Has anyone successfully run Windows PowerShell (current version) under Wine? This is for a command line utility that queries an ActiveDirectory server and outputs reports to Excel. I did write a Go version but unfortunately the folks who will maintain the code only know Powershell.
 I found some threads on WineHQ and on Reddit, but no walkthroughs. 
 https://forum.winehq.org/viewtopic.php?t=33963
 https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/pz28xz/running_windows_powershell_script_in_endeavour_os/
 I've tried with Winetricks and Bottles so far, but get DLL errors when launching. .NET and other libraries were installed. Others have copied DLLs from Windows to work around missing DLLs but this is not an option for me.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Michael and Yury here – we're building a no-code analytics platform for growth teams that automatically generates actionable data insights.
After working in the data space for many years, we realized there was still a huge gap in the marketing analytics market. Growth teams have so much marketing and advertising data, yet this siloed data is not actionable.
The existing BI and search-driven analytics solutions are designed for data-savvy people. In our experience (previously built an NLP company called FriendlyData), non-technical people just don't know what questions to ask.
So we decided to try a different approach: Narrative BI automatically generates a personalized feed of insights. You just need to connect your data sources (takes 2 min to set up), and you will get automated narratives, alerts, and reports in minutes.
We currently support UA, GA4, Google Ads, and Facebook Ads, but many more integrations will be added soon.
You can try it out for free and give feedback or roast it in the comments section. Just connect your data source, and you'll start getting narratives in 5 minutes.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Meta has announced
the open-source release of part of its internal source-code management
system, called Sapling.


	Sapling began 10 years ago as an initiative to make our monorepo
	scale in the face of tremendous growth. Public source control
	systems were not, and still are not, capable of handling
	repositories of this size. Breaking up the repository was also out
	of the question, as it would mean losing monorepo’s benefits, such
	as simplified dependency management and the ability to make broad
	changes quickly. Instead, we decided to go all in and make our
	source control system scale.

	Starting as an extension to the Mercurial open source project, it
	rapidly grew into a system of its own with new storage formats,
	wire protocols, algorithms, and behaviors. Our ambitions grew along
	with it, and we began thinking about how we could improve not only
	the scale but also the actual experience of using source control.


At this point, only the client side of the system has been released; the
company "hopes to" release the rest later.]]></summary>

 This will interest those who do Game Dev on Linux, not only was 5.1.0 released, but we also officially have got the Quixel Plugin for Linux.
 To say, not so long ago we had to compile the engine every update ourselves, so precompiled engine is great to have. This is a huge step forward with UE.
 Some of the notable improvements on the Linux side of things are to do with Clion & Rider detection on this patch.

一百年前的实体书如果保存良好，可以正常阅读。但十年前的电子书今天去阅读极有可能会遇到各种问题。电子书需要不断维护，从文件格式到存储介质的不断变化，需要不断重新处理。电子书是脆弱且受到威胁的。

老王点评：这是一个违反直觉的事情，但是确实如此，所以，我们应该用一种明文的开放格式来承载这些电子书。




16 台晶圆级芯片计算机集群组成千万核超算

制造世界上最大的芯片 —— 晶圆级引擎 2（WSE-2）的公司 Cerebras 今天公布了其仙女座超级计算机。仙女座是由 16 个 WSE-2 芯片组成的，共有 1350 万个计算核心，比世界顶级超级计算机 Frontier 系统多出百分之六十，AI 算力与 Frontier 相当。全套系统功耗 500 千瓦，这比同等级的超级计算机的功率要低得多。


消息来源：Venture Beat



老王点评：16 块脸盆大的芯片组成的超算，在 AI 算力上与世界第一超算相当。




美国的 Frontier 超算继续占据 TOP500 榜首

第 60 版 TOP500 显示，Frontier 系统仍然是名单上唯一拥有 Exaflop 级别算力的超级计算机。Frontier 的 HPL 分数和之前一样，1.102 EFlop/s，但是确是第二名的三倍。之前连续两年占据榜首的日本富岳超级计算机依旧保持第二名。中国排名前十的两台超算依旧是神威-太湖之光和天河-2A。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[据《每日邮报》11月15日报道，据知情人士透露，马斯克似乎在进一步削减成本，即将准备让推特员工自费在公司食堂用餐，而此前推特食堂是免费的，这招引来员工的愤怒。


亿万富翁马斯克在上个月以440亿美元的交易额正式接管了推特。此后，他解雇了推特首席执行官，并解雇了公司一半的员工，包括数千名合同工。


继裁员计划后，特斯拉CEO马斯克又在考虑新的成本削减措施，计划取消推特旧金山总部的免费午餐，转而让员工付费。他在推特上称，在过去的12个月里，每顿午餐的成本预计超过400美元，使得旧金山总部的年度餐饮服务成本达到约1300万美元。


马斯克的这番言论招致了推特前员工雷西·霍金斯（Tracy Hawkins）的强烈反对。霍金斯之前是推特负责“工作转型”（work transformation）的副总裁，负责推特总部的免费午餐计划。霍金斯称，事实上每人每天的餐费约为20美元至25美元。


此外，在员工入住率（员工到公司办公）方面，霍金斯和马斯克也存在着分歧。马斯克表示，员工的最高入住率为25%，而平均入住率不到10%。而霍金斯对这些数字提出了质疑，称办公室的入住率在20%到50%之间。


马斯克回应称：“记录显示员工最高在岗率为25%，平均在岗率低于10%。准备早餐的人比吃早餐的人多。他们甚至懒得提供晚餐，因为楼里没人。”


此前几天，马斯克解雇了数千名负责筛选网站上错误信息的合同工。一些合同工说，他们直到周六无法上班时，才意识到自己被解雇了。据科技网站《平台》的记者凯西牛顿称，5500名合同工中约有4400人被解雇。


在考虑取消免费午餐之际，马斯克数日前刚刚致信推特员工称，称公司将取消远程办公，无特殊情况，员工每周至少要在办公室工作40个小时。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[今天我很兴奋地与大家分享成千上万的 Fedora 项目贡献者的辛勤工作成果：Fedora Linux 37 版本来了！让我们看看这个最新版本给你带来了什么。一如既往，在从以前的版本升级之前，你应该确保你的系统是完全最新的。迫不及待地想开始了吗？在你阅读的同时 下载！


下载 Fedora Linux 37


两个新的版本

Fedora 的各个“版本Edition”是针对某一特定“市场”的旗舰产品。在 Fedora Linux 37 中，我们增加了两个新版本：Fedora CoreOS 是你可能还记得的 Atomic Host 的后续版本。从 Project Atomic 和 CoreOS 的初始的工作中汲取营养，它提供了一种自动更新机制，以托管基于容器的工作负载。通过原子更新和简单的回滚，它为你的基础设施增加了安全感。

Fedora Cloud 也作为一个版本回来了。云计算工作组的活动已经重新开始了。Cloud 版本提供了一个很棒的 Fedora 基础，可以在你喜欢的公共或私有云中运行。AMI 将在本周晚些时候在 AWS 市场上提供，在社区频道上现在已经可以使用。请查看 此网站 以了解可以在其他云供应商或你自己的云上运行的镜像！

桌面的改进

Fedora Workstation 专注于桌面体验。像往常一样，Fedora Workstation 采用了最新的 GNOME 版本。GNOME 43 在设置中包括一个新的设备安全面板，为用户提供关于系统中硬件和固件的安全信息。在上一个版本的基础上，更多的 GNOME 核心应用程序被移植到了最新版本的 GTK 工具包，提供了更好的性能和现代的外观。

在这个版本中，我们做了一些改变，让你的安装变得更精简。我们把 Firefox 浏览器的语言包分成了子包。这意味着如果你不需要本地化，你可以删除 firefo…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Linux Mint 的更新管理器变得更有用了！




Linux Mint 的更新管理器是该发行版的一个重要组成部分，它使新用户可以获得更为方便简易的体验。

最近的一次更新 Linux Mint 21 推出了许多改进，包括更新管理器对 Flatpak 的支持。

你只需要更新你的系统就可以获得这些改进。

⭐ 更新管理器中支持 Flatpak



是的，你没看错。这终于实现了。

Flatpak 支持已被添加到更新管理器中，用户只需单击几下就能更新 Flatpak 应用程序和运行时。

这将为进一步改善用户体验的统一更新体验提供了帮助。

这对新用户来说很有好处，他们不需要熟悉终端命令就能更新 Flatpak。此外，你不需要将 Flatpak 与软件中心集成（对于 GNOME 而言）。

换句话说，Linux Mint 团队增强了你使用 Flatpak 应用程序的体验。

除了对 Flatpak 的支持，本次更新还包括对 Linux Mint 21 的更多增强，这是一个开箱即用的更新。

这些改进包括：

对角栏的改进



Linux Mint 21 中的 角栏Corner Bar 添加了两项新特性：


能够在角栏设置左键点击和中键点击的动作；你可以配置它以显示桌面、工作区选择器或桌面。

一个允许你将鼠标悬停在角栏上以显示桌面的新选项。


Nemo 的更新



Nemo 文件管理器做了一些调整；现在，当文件被选中时，只会高亮显示文件名，而不是图标和文件名。

如果你还不知道, 你也可以通过我们建议的一些调整来增强 Nemo 文件管理器的体验：


调整 Linux 中的 Nemo 文件管理器，让它更好用的 15 种方法


此外，桌面图标被垂直翻转，桌面上下文菜单中添加了一个新的快捷方式，可以快速打开显示设置。

更少的密码提示

这是很多人可能喜欢的另一个用户体验调整。

当删除 Flatpak 或任何快捷方式或本地应用程序时，它将不再要求你输入密码。

类似地，在新立得（LCTT 译注：Linux 下的一个包管理工具）和更新管理器的情况下，将使用 pkexec 来记住密码。

这样，用户就不需要每次执行多个操作时都输入密码。

你可以浏览 Linux Mint 月度博客 以了解其它变化。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The scalability of Linus Torvalds was a
recurring theme during Linux's early years; these days maintainer struggles
are a recognized problem within open-source
communities in general.  It is thus not surprising that Sean Christopherson
gave a talk at Open Source Summit Europe (and KVM Forum) with the title
"Scaling KVM and its community".  The talk mostly focused on KVM for the
x86 architecture—the largest and most mature KVM architecture—which
Christopherson 
co-maintains.  But it was not a technical talk: most of the content can be
applied to other KVM architectures, or even other Linux subsystems, so that
they can avoid making the same kinds of mistakes.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[11月15日下午消息，去年5月，多家媒体报道称，郑州车主温先生自称花150万买的特斯拉Model X在高速行驶中突然降速，且刹车失灵。该车主希望特斯拉承认刹车系统出问题，并对他进行道歉。


当时，特斯拉回应称，初步诊断车辆报警原因为右前轮速传感器警报，并非温先生所述的“刹车失灵”。


特斯拉还称，车主向特斯拉提出免费更换至新款Model X车型的诉求，但特斯拉对此无法予以满足。


但不久后，一段网上流传的疑似温先生与他人对话录音显示，温先生疑似自己“策划”了这场维权行动，目的是通过舆论压力，使特斯拉对其进行“一赔三”。


随后，特斯拉以侵犯名誉权为由，将温先生告上法庭。


近日，该案件宣判。民事判决书显示，原告特斯拉胜诉。


据判决书显示，河南省郑州市管城回族区人民法院认定温先生的言论侵害了特斯拉汽车（北京）公司的名誉权。法院判决，温先生需在《河南法制报》上向特斯拉公开道歉，并支付赔偿款1万元。]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[你可以通过以下方式确定你的 Linux 发行版中是否正在运行 systemd 或其它初始化系统。


首个进程在你启动 Linux 发行版时开始运行，它称为初始化进程 init（初始化initialization的缩写）。它的进程标识符为 1（即 pid=1）。基于 Unix 的系统中的所有进程和应用程序都是这个初始化进程的后代。

根据功能和特性，存在不同类型的初始化进程。例如，systemd、Runit、OpenRC、sysVinit 等。其中，systemd 是最流行和最现代的一种，被包括 Ubuntu 和 Fedora 在内的所有现代 Linux 发行版使用和采用。

与传统的基于 Unix 的初始化系统相比，systemd 及其性能一直存在争议。但这就是另外一个话题了。

让我们看看如何确定在 Linux 发行版中运行的是 systemd 还是其它初始化系统。

systemd 还是其它初始化系统？

不幸的是，没有直接的命令可以找到它。你可以从初始化进程追溯它，它基本上是到 /sbin/init 的符号链接，即 pid=1。

使用 strings 命令打印嵌入在二进制文件 /sbin/init 中的文本并使用以下命令搜索 init：

strings /sbin/init | grep init


示例 1

在下面的输出中，它是一个运行 Debian（Peppermint OS）的 sysVinit 系统。如你所见，它清楚地显示了 init 进程名称。

strings /sbin/init | grep init




如果在上述同一个系统中找 systemd，那么不会有任何结果。因此，你可以得出结论，你正在运行 sysVinit 而不是 systemd。

示例 2

如果你在 systemd 系统中运行上述命令，你可以在输出的第一行轻松看到 systemd 及其版本。

strings /sbin/init | grep systemd




示例 3

你也可以尝试使用 pstree 命令打印进程树，它应该会显示第一个进程名称。它应该是 systemd 或 init，如下例所示。

pstree






这就好了。这样你就可以轻松找出你的发行版是使用 systemd 还是其他的。

1962 年夏天，美国宇航局启动了水手 1 号任务，这是一项无人驾驶的任务，该装置将飞过金星并探测数据。当时的工程师通常在纸上写出他们的代码。然后这些代码通过一个复杂的系统被翻译成计算机可读的卡片，然后通过计算机执行该程序。这种手工使得意外错误率变得很高。缺失的符号与字符最终导致了水手 1 号任务的彻底失败。这次任务在当时花费了大约 1800 万美元，相当于今天的 1.5 亿美元。

一个简单的安卓锁屏漏洞获得了 7 万美元

研究人员发现，任何能拿到谷歌 Pixel 手机的人都可以通过换上自己的 SIM 卡，并输入预设的恢复代码，从而绕过安卓操作系统的锁屏保护。这个漏洞的利用非常简单，但谷歌花了大约五个月的时间来修复。谷歌为此向他支付了 7 万美元的奖金。

老王点评：看似这个钱挣的容易，但是实际上研究人员投入了大量精力才可能遇到这样一块“狗头金”。

深度伪造视频现在无处不在，你可能见过名人做或说他们实际上从未做过的事情的视频。英特尔开发了 FakeCatcher，这项技术能够以 96% 的准确率检测虚假人脸视频。这是世界上第一个实时深度伪造检测器，它可以在几毫秒内返回结果。该工具是通过检测视频像素中微妙的“血流”信号，在真实视频中寻找真实的线索。当心脏泵血时，人的静脉会改变颜色，这些血流信号是可以从面部各处收集的，算法将这些信号翻译成时空图。然后，利用深度学习，就可以立即检测出一个视频是真的还是假的。

老王点评：果然魔高一尺，道高一丈。不过我想深度伪造可能很快就会学会添加血流信号。]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you want to use a terminal based file manager over ssh (lf or ranger), but the server doesn't have ranger in the repos (synology NAS), or you don't have sudo privileges to install it on the server, here's a solution:
 Use sshfs to mount that server path.
 sudo mkdir /mnt/server Or any directory name you want.
 Run id and take note of your uid and gid. 
 Change ownership of that directory so that it doesn't require sudo anymore:
 sudo chown -r uid:gid /mnt/server 
 Now you can see and edit that path with your regular user. 
 sshfs <username>@<ip_address>:/path/ /mnt/server
 If you want to use your RSA key instead, so that you don't have to type the password every time do:
 sshfs -o IdentityFile=/path/to/.ssh/private_key \ <username>@<ip_address>:/path/ /mnt/server 
 You can now browse to it from ranger or lf, then bookmark it with the m key.
 To have a shortcut in the home directory, run: ln -s "/mnt/server" "$HOME/server"
 To un-mount it, do: fusermount -u /mnt/server
 The reason I like to use ranger over ssh, is the same reason I like to use it locally. It's incredibly faster to navigate using ranger than any GUI file manager, plus I have access to vim in case I want to bulk rename, or edit dotfiles, and other cool keybinds set to other stuff.
 I hope you found this helpful. :)

 Does such a learning tool exist? Or are there tools that can dump these entries and inodes?

 For instance, I've found:
 Parted Magic: Collection of programs and tools to detect, repair or recover data from corrupt hard drives. Unfortunately paid.
 GRUB Boot Repair Tool: As the name implies. Just repairs or reinstalls GRUB on an existing system. Saved my laptop twice with this.
 Puppy Linux: Very lightweight Distro designed to be ran on old or low spec PCs. Used it to backup all the files from my very first PC (With only 256MB of RAM!) and it didn't take an hour just to boot. 
 I've got all these on my Ventoy USB and would love to build a set of useful Distros like these just for the sake of it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I tried switching to Wayland a while back during the covid lockdowns, and while I loved how smooth it was, some issues prevented me from sticking with it. Mainly the inability to present my screen on Google Meet conversations on Chromium and being unable to use color pickers. Two things I do very frequently. Have those been fixed?
 I am considering switching again eventually, so what is the state of Wayland currently? Is the experience currently on par with X11 or are there problems average users will eventually face if they switch now?
 What still needs to be fixed/polished on Wayland before the user experience for most people is better than X11's?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm a big fan of shell scripts. What I missed is a CLI "calculator". But not just to do simple operations on numbers. It would be nice to have some Computer Algebra System available through CLI.
 For impatient - github
 So I made such a tool. Here's a simple use case:  $ amcli eval "1 / 2" 0.5 $ amcli eval "e ^ pi > pi ^ e" True 
 Here's differentation:  $ amcli diff x "sin(x) + b * ln(x)" cos(x) + 1 / x * b 
 Let's solve some equation  $ amcli solve x "a x^3 = b" (b / a) ^ (1/3) (-1/2 + i * 1/2 * sqrt(3)) * (b / a) ^ (1/3) (-1/2 + i * sqrt(3/4) * (-1)) * (b / a) ^ (1/3) 
 Let's convert to LaTeX:  $ amcli latex "1/2 + sqrt(3)" \frac{1}{2}+\sqrt{3} 
 We can also pipe:  $ echo "sin(x) + cos(x)" | amcli sub x "y/z" | amcli diff y cos(y / z) * z / z ^ 2 + -sin(y / z) * z / z ^ 2  (so we substituted y/z instead of x and then differentiated over y)
 So let's quickly compute the gradient of a neural network with MSE loss function!  echo "[ x_1, x_2, x_3 ]" \ | amcli sub X _ "[[ w_11, w_12, w_13 ], [ w_21, w_22, w_23 ], [ w_31, w_32, w_33 ]] * X" \ | amcli fsimp \ | amcli sub X _ "e ^ X / (1 + e ^ X)" \ | amcli fsimp \ | amcli sub X _ "[ v_1, v_2, v_3 ]T * X" \ | amcli fsimp \ | amcli sub pred _ "(pred - target)^2" \ | amcli diff w_21 \ | amcli fsimp 
 Why?
 To automate tasks in shell. That means, it's computer algebra which is language-agnostic. Simple example: some plugin for text editor to replace LaTeX code instead of a formula when selected.
 It's also simple, small (8.7 M by the time of writing this) and with nearly-zero startup overhead.
 It's finally free, under GNU GPL v3. I also intend to make it more cross-platform (right now it's only available for win-x64, linux-x64, osx-64).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[大家好！今年早些时候，我在写《DNS 是如何工作的》 时，有人问我——为什么人们有时在域名的末尾加一个点？例如，如果你通过运行 dig example.com 查询 example.com 的 IP，你会看到一下内容：

$ dig example.com
example.com.        5678    IN  A   93.184.216.34


执行完 dig 命令后，example.com 有一个 . ——变成了 example.com.！发生了什么？

有些 DNS 工具也要求传给它的域名后加一个 .：如果你在使用 miekg/dns 时传给它 example.com，它会报错：

// trying to send this message will return an error
m := new(dns.Msg)
m.SetQuestion("example.com", dns.TypeA)


最初我以为我知道这个问题的答案（“呃，末尾的点意味着域名是完全限定的？”）。这是对的 —— 一个完全限定域名fully qualified domain name（FQDN）是一个末尾有 . 的域名！

但是为什么末尾的点是有用且重要的呢？

在 DNS 的请求/响应中，域名的末尾并没有 “.”

我曾经（错误地）认为 “为什么末尾有一个点？”的答案可能是 “在 DNS 请求/响应中，域名末尾有一个 .，所以我们把它放进去，以匹配你的计算机实际发送/接收的内容”。但事实并不是这样！

当计算机发送 DNS 请求/响应时，域名的末尾并没有点。实际上，域名中没有点。

域名会被编码成一系列的长度/字符串对。例如，域名 example.com 被编码为这 13 个字节。

7example3com0


编码后的内容一个点也没有…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[本指南介绍了如何在没有互联网连接的情况下离线更新 Ubuntu 的步骤。


在很多情况下，你可能需要在没有互联网连接的情况下更新你的 Ubuntu 系统。你可能在外地不方便上网，也可能你需要更新一堆未联网的 Ubuntu，不管是哪种情况，保持你的系统更新最新的软件包总是需要的。

当然，始终建议通过联网来更新系统。

但有时，出于安全考虑，这是不行的。连接到互联网可能需要给你的系统进行额外的加固，以保护它们免受黑客和恶意软件的攻击。

以下的方法使用 apt-offline 来解决这些问题，并概述了在没有互联网的情况下离线更新 Ubuntu 的步骤。

准备环节


一台能连接到网络的 Ubuntu（你朋友的、咖啡馆、实验室系统）

存储了软件包的 U 盘

两个系统都安装了 apt-offline：一个系统离线，另一个系统联网


安装 apt-offline

在两个系统下安装 apt-offline。你可以使用以下命令安装：

sudo apt install apt-offline


如果你想在离线的目标系统安装 apt-offline，你可以提前下载到 U 盘里，然后复制到目标系统，再使用下面的命令安装。

Ubuntu 22.04 LTS 和其他版本的下载链接如下所示。你可以选择一个镜像并下载 deb 文件。


下载 .deb 文件 – apt-offline


sudo dpkg -i name_of_package.deb


如何更新 Ubuntu

在离线的目标系统上打开终端，使用以下命令创建一个 .sig 签名文件：

sudo apt-offline set ~/offline-data.sig




在这个刚创建的签名文件中，包含下载所需的软件包的路径和详细信息。



把签名文件复制到 U 盘中，再插到联网的 Ubuntu 系统上。

在联网的 Ubuntu 上创建一个目录（参见下面）来存放这些文件。

打开一个终端，运行以下命令来下载所需的软件包。记得根据你的系统，更改下载目录和 .sig 签名文件的路径。

apt-offline get -d ~/offline-data-dir offline-data.sig




你可以看到文件相应下载，然后复制整个下载目录到 U 盘，再插到离线的 Ubuntu 系统。

运行以下命令将下载的软件包安装到离线系统，记得根据你的系统更改目录路径。

sudo apt-offline install offline-data-dir/




如果一切顺利，你将获得一个更新完的 Ubuntu。

重复以上步骤，就可以保持你的离线 Ubuntu 为最新版本。

希望以上教程能帮到你更新离线的 Ubuntu 系统，如果你遇到任何问题，请在下面的评论框中告诉我。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[据报道，知情人士透露，从本周开始，亚马逊计划对企业和技术部门裁员1万人。这将成为该公司迄今为止规模最大的一次裁员。知情人士称，此次裁员将占亚马逊公司员工的3%左右。由于亚马逊正在内部审核各个业务的优先级，所以具体数字可能会有所变化。


知情人士表示，这家美国零售巨头计划对其设备部门（负责生产Alexa系列语音控制设备和家居安全摄像头）、人力资源和零售部门进行裁员，但目前还不清楚他们具体将在何时通知员工。知情人士将亚马逊及其他公司最近的裁员归咎于不确定的宏观经济环境。


美国科技公司经历了多年的快速招聘后，近期却因为担心经济衰退而展开了一系列裁员。就在上周，Facebook母公司Meta Platforms表示将裁员逾1.1万人，约占其员工总数的13%。


亚马逊预计，在通常利润丰厚的假日季期间，该公司的销售额增长将会有所放缓。


该公司CFO布莱恩·奥尔萨夫斯基（Brian Olsavsky）在上月的一次电话会议上表示，亚马逊发现，美国的家庭购物预算出现紧缩，他们仍将继续与高企的通胀率和能源成本做斗争。


亚马逊随后透露，他们将会在未来几个月冻结增量公司招聘。


上周有报道称，亚马逊的设备部门近年来的年度运营亏损超过50亿美元。由于部分用户只用语音助理来完成为数不多的几项任务，所以亚马逊也在考虑是否要专注于Alexa的新功能。


如果将仓库和物流员工都计算在内，截至9月30日，亚马逊的员工总数超过150万人。照此计算，此次裁员不到其员工总数的1%。

 github: github.com/sayan01/present
 Small and precise syntax: $ for banner text, # for title, ! for image, @ for links, - for list items
 the source file is compiled into a pdf which is ready to be presented with one command:
 present source.pre 
 I know this looks like latex+beamer or suckless/sent. That is because it was inspired by them, but this is (according to me) better than them for making presentations. Latex is for writing papers and is the best at it, adding a doc-class to it to make it render presentations is overkill for the job. It has too many complex syntax to learn and still to many options for styling. If the user is spending time on the style of the slides, he has forgetten why slides are made: to augment and aid their presentation, not be the spotlight. Presentations should be simple and to the point, without unnecesary animations and flairs. Sent does a very good job doing just that. The problem is sent does not compile into a pdf or any other portable format, rather creates an X window. so sent is a dependency on the system used to present the slides, which is not always possible to meet. present compiles the source code into a pdf, which is universally portable and almost all devices and OS support pdf. even browsers can render pdf. It also does not support links and image captions.
 present has very small syntax, which can be learnt in under a minute. These components, according to me, are enough for any presentation. The syntax is similar to markdown (sometimes easier than markdown). More details are there in the README of the github repository.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[英伟达采用形式验证来验证软件安全性

英伟达软件安全副总裁说，“面向测试的软件验证对安全来说根本不起作用，你可以对提供给用户的功能的质量有一个衡量标准，但对于安全问题，就没有什么作用，……很难知道你是否已经完成了。”幸运的是，有可能用数学方法证明你的代码的行为与它的规范精确一致。这个过程被称为“形式验证”。英伟达采用软件形式验证行业解决方案 SPARK 来证明软件的安全性。在几年前进行过概念验证后，现在许多英伟达产品在使用 SPARK 组件发布。


消息来源：AdaCore



老王点评：形式验证是个好方法，但是不是那么容易掌握和推行。




JavaScript、Java、Python、Kotlin 和 Rust 开发者增长惊人

根据 SlashData 去年夏天从 163 个国家的 26000 多名开发者调查统计而成的第 23 期《开发者国家报告》，JavaScript 仍然是最大的编程语言社区，全球估计有 1960 万开发者每天都在使用 JavaScript；在过去的两年里，Java 社区的规模已经从 830 万增加到 1650 万，而同期开发者只增加了 50%；Python 在过去两年中增加了约 800 万新的开发人员；Kotlin 和 Rust 社区的规模在过去两年里都翻了一番。


消息来源：ZDNet



老王点评：开发人员越来越倾向于使用主流开发工具，所以流行的越发流行，但是这样就会扼杀一些创新。




密码学家建议考虑非晶格的后量子密码算法

目前许多密码学系统的安全性是基于大数的因数分解的，但因数分解的一个怪癖使其容易受到量子计算机的攻击。因此人们对上世纪 90 年代提出的“晶格密码学”寄予厚望，美国 NIST 选择的四个后量子密码学标准有三个采用晶格密码学。RSA 算法名称中的 S，Adi Shamir 对此表示担忧，“从某种意义上说，我们是把所有鸡蛋放在同一个篮子里”。今年夏天早些时候，一个有前途的后量子密码学方案不是用量子计算机，而是用一台普通的笔记本电脑破解的。


消息来源：Slashdot



老王点评：确实如此，只有一种抗量子的密码理论，很难说会不会被发现潜在的弱点。]]></summary>

Overall, TTM (Translation-Table Maps) is a memory manager that is used to accelerate devices with dedicated memory. Basically, all the resources are grouped together by objects of buffers in different sizes. TTM then handles the lifetime, the movements and the CPU mapping of those objects (https://docs.kernel.org/gpu/drm-mm.html).
 Based on the kernel documentation, each DRM (Direct Rendering Manager) driver needs a memory manager. There are two memory managers supported by DRM: TTM and GEM (Graphics Execution Manager).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[时至今日，世界上已经有成百上千种不同的 Linux 发行版。

它们中的大多数都可以被划归为三个大类 : Debian、Red Hat（Fedora）以及 Arch Linux。

使用基于 Debian/Ubuntu、Red Hat/SUSE 或者 Arch 的 Linux 发行版自然有它们的优势。它们很受大众欢迎，因此它们的包管理器能够提供大量的软件包。

然而，有一些用户更倾向于使用从头开始构建、独立于 DEB/RPM 这类包管理系统之外的发行版。

在这篇文章当中，我们将列出一些优秀的独立 Linux 发行版。


注意 : 显然，下面的列表显然不会包括一些广受欢迎，通常作为创建新发行版的基础的发行版，如 Debian、Ubuntu 和 Fedora 等。此外，列表顺序不分先后，没有特定的排名。


1、NixOS



NixOS 最初发布于 2003 年，NixOS 建立在 Nix 包管理器之上。它每年发布两个版本，通常是在 5 月和 11 月。

NixOS 可能不是一个直接面向新用户或普通用户的发行版。然而，其独特的 包管理 方法吸引了各种用户。

此外，它仍然支持 32 位系统。

其他特性：


构建隔离的包

可靠的升级，并且具有回滚功能

可重现的系统配置



NixOS


2、Gentoo Linux



Geetoo Linux 是一个主要针对操作系统专家的独立 Linux 发行版。它是为那些希望自由定制、微调和优化操作系统以满足其要求的用户而构建。

Gentoo 使用 Portage 包管理器 来创建和安装软件包，通常还允许你针对你的硬件来优化它们。Chrome 的开源版本 Chromium OS 便是使用 Gentoo 作为其核心的。

不要忘记，Gentoo 是 仍然支持 32 位…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[以下是如何在 Ubuntu 和其他 Linux 发行版中提高笔记本和桌面的音量的方法。


你有没有觉得你的 Ubuntu 笔记本的音量太小，尽管你把音量调到了 100%？我相信你有过。主要原因是：很明显，笔记本电脑的扬声器输出强度比大型扬声器要低。

此外，Ubuntu 和其他发行版将默认的最大音量设置为 100%，也就是 0dB（分贝）。0dB 是最大音量的参考值。做个比较，如果你把音量设置为 -10dB，这意味着你的音量比最大的 0dB 安静。

VLC 和一些媒体播放器允许你将音量提高到 200%。在最新的 Ubuntu 中使用一些设置，你可以将音量进一步提高。


注意：在你尝试和使用以下方法之前，请记住，每个扬声器都有其制造商设定的硬件限制。偶尔一次，播放超过 100% 的音频是可以的。但是，连续放大到更高的分贝可能会使输出的音频失真，并且从长远来看可能会损坏你的扬声器。因此，在使用时要小心谨慎，并有所限制。


在 Ubuntu 和其他发行版中提高扬声器音量

对于最新的 Ubuntu 22.04 及以上版本（GNOME）

从应用菜单中打开“设置Settings”，进入“声音Sound”标签。

启用 “过度放大Over Amplification” 开关。在你启用的那一刻，你应该看到音量条被扩大了。



现在你可以享受音量提升来听音乐了。

Fedora、Arch Linux 和其他发行版

如果你使用带有 GNOME 的 Fedora 工作站，你将看不到上述选项，因为这是 Ubuntu 特有的设置。见下面。



因此，对于任何其他 Linux 发行版（Arch、Fedora、RedHat 等）或桌面（KDE、Xfce、LXQt 等），打开终端并安装 PulseAudio 音量控制器。

Fedora、RedHat Linux、OpenSUSE 等基于 RPM 的发行版：

sudo dnf install pavucontrol


对于 Arch Linux、Manjaro：

sudo pacman -S pavucontrol


基于 Ubuntu 的非 GNOME 发行版：

sudo apt install pavucontrol


如何使用

安装后，从应用菜单中打开 pavucontrol，它应该有个 &ldquoulseAudio Volume Control” 菜单项。



总结

记住，上述方法可以提高整个系统的扬声器音量。这意味着系统的声音和警报也会受到影响。所以，要记住这一点。正如我前面提到的，如果连续使用，提升扬声器音量超过 100% 可能会导致扬声器变形或损坏。

我希望这个教程能帮助你提高系统音量。如果你遇到问题，请在评论栏里告诉我。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Howdy! This post was my original post, but I have also posted this question in the common_lisp and emacs subreddits.
 I'm installing Gentoo, and I'm looking at either StumpWM or EXWM as a WM, and I'm leaning toward EXWM simply because Emacs. However, I'm sure there's a lot I don't know about the comparison between them. I'm wondering if you nice folks might share your insights.
 I use Emacs a lot, and plan on using it more and more as I get my config dialed in. I'm fully invested in Emacs, and consider it to be part of the OS, so I'll be using it either way. I think having more stuff in Emacs is nothing but handy.
 I will be using this setup on several PCs, including a crappy laptop, a gaming laptop, and a few desktops. Gaming is the main thing I'm worried about. I just use KDE on the gaming laptop for now.
 I'm also interested in programming, specifically in Lisp. I'm leaning more toward Common Lisp, which is what StumpWM is written in. Of course EXWM is Emacs Lisp, but that's kind of Emacs-specific and wouldn't be used for other software development. I've also considered learning scheme because I have a copy of SICP, but that's taters under the skillet.
 Finally, I'm a few months away from getting going on managing a homelab. None of the servers will run this system, but all of the management will be done through it on my main PC. I will be doing a lot of multitasking, troubleshooting, remote-management, security stuff, note-taking, etc.
 So, in a nutshell, I'm wondering: - What can StumpWM do that EXWM can't do? - What can EXWM do that StumpWM can't do? - What are the major limitations of each, specifically when compared to one another? - How will each compare when stacked against the things I want to use it for? - How does the ecosystem for each one compare? I know the Emacs ecosystem decently well, but not StumpWM's. Are there many plugins / extensions? Are there many users communicating regularly with each other?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[分享一些我最喜欢的开源写作工具。


在我的职业生涯中，我已经写过很多东西，主要是作为一名 IT 顾问，创建产品文档作为给的客户可交付成果。这些文档通常针对不同操作系统和软件产品提供说明。

自 2018 年，我开始在 www.opensource.com 上发表关于开源软件的文章。当然，我使用开源软件进行协作。接下来我将介绍我使用过的四款开源编辑器。

1、Vi

Vi 也被称为 Vim（LCTT 校注：此外不确，Vi 和 Vim 是两个软件，只是 Vim 取代了 Vi，并以 vi 的名字运行。），是我学习的第一款开源编辑器。这是我在计算机科学课程中学习的编辑器，并且我所有的 C 语言编程都是通过它完成的。自 1995 年以来，实际上我一直使用它作为命令行编辑器。这款工具有多个迭代版本，以至于我都可以为之写一系列文章了。我只想说，在我的日常使用中，我坚持使用它的基本命令行形式，并进行最小的定制。

2、LibreOffice Writer

Writer 是 LibreOffice 开源办公套件的一部分。它是由文档基金会Document Foundation维护的全功能文字处理器。它支持行业标准格式，例如开放文档格式 （ODF）、Open XML 和 MS Office DOC、DOCX。可以在其官方网站上 了解有关 Writer 的更多信息。

3、Ghostwriter

Ghostwriter 是一个用于 Markdown 的文本编辑器。它有一个很好的实时查看器和语法指南或备忘单功能。访问官方网站 了解更多内容。

4、Gedit

Gedit 是许多 Linux 发行版中的基本图形编辑器，被描述为“用于 GNOME 桌面的小型轻量级文本编辑器”。我最近开始使用它来创建 Asciidoc 格式的文章。使用 Asciidoc 的好处是语法易于管理并可导入到 Drupal 等 Web 渲染系统中。通过 Gedit Wiki 了解许多提示和技巧。

编辑文本

开源世界中有大量编辑软件。随着我继续写作，这个列表可能会增加。我的主要目标是格式简单。我希望我的文章易于在互联网平台上导入、转换和发布。

你的写作风格、功能需求和目标受众将指导你确定首选工具。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[据媒体报道，根据推特全职员工分享的内部沟通记录，大量推特合同工发现，他们在本周末突然被解雇了，因为他们已无法访问推特聊天工具 Slack 和其他工作系统。


据科技新闻网站 Platformer 报道，来自推特的消息称，推特已终止了 4400 名合同工的合同，占据总计 5500 名合同工中的 80%。此番裁员将对保持网站正常运行的内容审核和核心基础设施服务产生重大影响。


其中一些推特合同工在印度等海外地区工作。推特全职员工表示，在与他们合作的合同工被解雇之前，他们没有收到任何内部通知。据这些员工透露，推特已经解雇了所有的内部沟通团队。他们还苦笑着说，报道该公司的媒体现在充当了内部沟通的角色。


对合同工的裁员标志着这家社交媒体平台最新的瘦身举措。自从10月28日被埃隆·马斯克（Elon Musk）收购以来，该公司已经裁员大约一半。


在埃隆·马斯克10月28日收购该公司后，推特已经解雇了一半的员工，大约为3700人。


马斯克已告知剩余推特员工，他出售了价值数十亿美元的特斯拉股票，目的就是“拯救”推特。目前还不清楚马斯克是否会继续出售特斯拉股票以偿还推特的债务。


马斯克还告诉推特员工，在经济低迷的情况下，推特存在破产的可能。在马斯克与推特展开收购拉锯战时，广告商纷纷逃离或暂停在该平台上支出。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ubuntu 21.10 “Impish Indri” 及之后的版本将 Firefox Snap 设为默认浏览器。如果你不喜欢 Snap，可以通过以下方式将其删除并使用库存版本。


关于 Snap 是否是 APT 的更好替代品，一直存在争议。而许多用户更喜欢 Snap 系统，也有一些人非常讨厌它。Ubuntu 和 Canonical 认为它是 Linux 的最佳安装仓库和包管理工具之一。 Snap 被讨厌的主要原因是它的启动很慢。然而，这个论点是另一篇文章的内容。

从 Ubuntu 中删除 Firefox Snap 版本

所以，如果你还没有 听说过这件事，Ubuntu 21.10（和所有后续版本）默认提供 Firefox Snap 包。因此，当你从 Ubuntu 21.10 开始安装时，默认的左侧停靠区的快捷方式是 Firefox 的 Snap 版本。你可以使用以下各种方法对其进行验证。





如果你因为 性能 和存储问题而不喜欢 Snap，可以通过以下命令将其删除。

如果已经打开，那么关闭所有 Firefox 实例。

打开一个终端。然后运行以下命令：

sudo snap remove firefox


等待命令完成。这将从你的系统中删除它的 Snap 可执行文件，并断开 Firefox 与各种系统服务的连接。但是主目录下的 Snap 目录仍然存在。你可以使用以下命令手动删除它：

cd ~/snap
rm -r firefox


安装 Firefox 替代方法

现在，当你删除了 Firefox，你可以通过以下方式来使用此浏览器。

方法 1 – 使用 PPA（推荐）

在使用此方法之前，请确保如上删除了 Firefox 的 Snap 版本。

有一个 官方 Firefox PPA，由其开发团队维护。你可以将此 …]]></summary>

我工作需要使用音视频媒体，不管你处理哪种媒体，你肯定知道标准化是一种有价值的工具。就像你不会试图把一个分数加到一个小数上而不转换其中一个一样，我已经知道，把不同格式的媒体组合起来并不理想。为了方便用户，大多数爱好者级应用程序使转换过程不可见。然而，对于那些需要控制媒体细节的用户的灵活软件，会通常让你自己提前将媒体转换为所需的格式。我有一些最喜欢的音频转换工具，其中之一就是号称“音频的瑞士军刀” —— SoX。

安装

在 Linux 或 BSD 上，可以从软件存储库或 Ports 树中安装 sox 命令（，以及一些有用的符号链接）。

你也可以从 Sourceforge.net 上安装 SoX。它不经常发布，但它的代码库往往是稳定的，所以如果你想要最新的功能（如 Opus 支持），构建它是容易和安全的。

SoX 主要提供了 sox 命令，但是创建了一些有用的符号链接：play、rec 和 soxi。

使用 SoX 获取文件信息

SoX 可以读取和重写音频数据。它是否存储重写的音频数据取决于你。在有些情况下，你不需要存储转换后的数据，例如，当你将输出直接发送到扬声器进行回放时。然而，在进行任何转换之前，最好首先确定要处理的是什么。

使用 soxi 命令也可以收集音频文件信息。soxi 会符号链接到 soxi --info。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[To promote Linux on the desktop, we need to promote companies that are pushing desktop Linux forward.
 Most traditional Linux companies (Red Hat/IBM, Canonical, SUSE) no longer care about desktop Linux.
 In my mind the following is the list of companies that still care about Linux desktop:
  
Google (Chrome OS, Chrome OS Flex, Android).
 System76 (Pop!_OS)
 Valve (SteamOS)
  
To promote desktop Linux we need to be supporting these companies by buying/using their software and hardware.
 Any other companies that I missed?

Until that gets released, is there a way to keep watch of the progress on that until arrives for everyone or at the bare minimum just on their distros?
 I would love to still have hope to watch and edit movies in 4K HDR both natively and streamed on my device.

 Can someone with this mouse just test for me if there is any way to control its RGB on Linux?
 Just checking the list of supported devices from the OpenRGB software isn't a guaranteed way of knowing this, because my current mouse isnt't listed there, but I can still control its RGB with this software with no problems.

 i am looking for a good Solution to backup all my Webservers and NAS to a BackUp-Server. I prefer to Pull-Backups instead of Push them because the Webserver know the least of the BackUp-Server. If a Server gets compromised, the Hacker don't have any access to the BackUp-Server.
 What Kind of Software do you use to create and manage your BackUp-Jobs? A WebGUI with a Dashboard would be awesome to overview the Jobs and get Alerts if a BackUp failed. Is there any "Industry-Standard" for that?

Now every time I try to learn something new... there's always a build system in the way, with MSTOICAL it was Autoconf, with switching to Linux, I couldn't get WikidPad to build on Linux, trying to build a lifeboat for Twitter, Python works, but then modules require builds that break.
Is it possible to have a system without Make or the like?
Alternatively, any good resources for the above?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[据QQ邮箱网站消息，目前，QQ邮箱的容量策略已经进行了调整。现阶段邮箱初始容量为2GB，最多可免费提供16G的邮箱容量，也就是翻倍3次。如果需要用到更多容量则需付费将邮箱容量和文件中转站升级至2048GB，费用为15元每月。


免费升级后的容量不会再降回去。


此前QQ邮箱每90天手动免费扩容一次，扩容后邮箱容量翻倍，而且当你容量用到50%之后也会自动翻倍。


QQ邮箱是一款腾讯在2002年推出的，向用户提供安全、稳定、快速、便捷电子邮件服务的邮箱产品，已为数亿用户提供免费和增值邮箱服务。


以下为QQ邮箱网站的“邮箱容量升级说明”。



新的容量策略为：免费提供最大可达16G的邮箱容量，可按需扩容；也可以通过付费将邮箱容量升级至2048GB；


1、邮箱初始容量为2GB，免费容量最大可达16GB；


2、我们将根据邮箱容量的使用情况自动扩容，你也可以手动升级容量，每3个月（按90天计算）可手动扩容一次；


3、免费升级后的容量不会再降回去，可放心使用；


4、若需要更大的邮箱容量，可付费升级邮箱容量至2048GB；付费到期后，邮箱容量将恢复为付费前的容量；


5、节约是种美德。我们依然推荐大家定期清理用不到的邮件。此外，我们将普通附件的大小限制也已提升到了50M。]]></summary>

也许你有一些古老的激光打印机或一体机，但是它们没有 Windows 11 驱动程序。而 Linux 在支持旧硬件方面明显更好，如果驱动程序仍然可以编译，它就不会被删除。现在你可以通过在 WSL 内运行的 OpenPrinting 中使用旧打印机进行打印。这之所以可以实现，还要感谢 WSL2 支持了 systemd，从而支持 Canonical 的 Snap 版的打印机应用。


消息来源：The Register



老王点评：没想到 WSL 还有这种好处！




DeviantArt 为作品添加 AI 许可标签

著名艺术网站 DeviantArt 推出了自己的 AI 艺术生成器 DreamUp。为了让艺术家控制他们的作品，DeviantArt 让他们可以选择该工具是否可以使用他们的风格作为直接灵感。并在不允许 AI 使用的作品页面添加特定的标签。DeviantArt 也鼓励其他创作者平台采用这种方法，以确保艺术家仍然能够与在线观众分享他们的作品。


消息来源：Engadget



老王点评：确实应该形成一种行业规范，或者新的许可证惯例。




一根普通光纤传输全球互联网流量

通过将 55 种模式的信号射入单芯光纤，该团队能够以每秒 1.53 Pbps 的数据速率进行传输。1Pbps 相当于 100 万 Gbps。据估计，整个全球互联网的带宽只有不到 1Pbps，这意味着这根光纤足够处理全球所有的互联网带宽。虽然这不是最快的传输速率，之前有日本研究机构达到了 1.84 Pbps 的速率，但这个纪录的意义在于，它是使用标准覆层直径为 0.125 毫米的光纤实现的，很大程度上与现有的基础设施兼容。

老王点评：带宽扩展的太快，说不准以后个人设备也需要几个 G 的带宽了。]]></summary>

Two well known command line tools on Linux which can help with dynamic analysis are “strace” and “ltrace”. “strace” allows tracing of system calls (“man 2 syscalls”) and signals (“man 7 signal”). I am not going to focus on “strace” in this writeup, you can read more about it using “man strace”.
 On the other hand, “ltrace” allows the tracing of dynamic library calls and signals received by the traced process (“man 1 ltrace”). Moreover, it can also trace syscalls (like “strace”) if you are using the “-S” flag.
 If you have tried using “ltrace” in the new versions of Ubuntu you probably saw that the library calls are not shown (you can verify it using “ltrace `which ls`”). In order to demonstrate that I …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[本指南介绍了使用 GNOME Boxes 将虚拟机镜像移动到另一台主机所需的步骤。


GNOME Boxes 是由 GNOME 项目创建的虚拟化程序。此程序用作 libvirt 的前端。libvirt 是用于管理平台虚拟化的开源 API、守护进程和管理工具。它支持不同的虚拟化技术，如 KVM、Xen、VMware ESXi、QEMU 等。

如果你想使用 GNOME Boxes 创建虚拟机，请参阅本指南。

在本教程中，我将解释如何将任何虚拟机镜像文件（已使用 GNOME Boxes 创建并运行）移动到不同的主机并运行它。

这样，你不再需要从操作系统重新安装虚拟机。此外，它是便携式的，你可以将虚拟机镜像放在 U 盘中。

如何使用 GNOME Boxes 将虚拟机镜像移动到另一台主机

我希望你已经在 GNOME Boxes 中创建了一个虚拟机。如果没有，请查看 本指南。

GNOME Boxes 和 libvert 使用以下目录存储虚拟机镜像和配置。如下所述，你需要仔细备份每个文件。

GNOME Boxes 将虚拟机的物理镜像（通常为数 GB 大小）保存在以下路径中。对于你的每个虚拟机，你都会在其中找到一个镜像。

~/.local/share/gnome-boxes/images/




将图像文件复制到新主机的路径：~/.local/share/gnome-boxes/images/。

将 libvirt 的 XML 配置从以下路径复制到新主机的相同位置。

~/.config/libvirt/qemu/




在上述路径中，你应该会看到每个虚拟机的单独 xml 文件。复制你需要的那个。

在你当前的系统中打开以下文件。

~/.config/gnome-boxes/sources/'QEMU Session'


复制属于你的虚拟机的部分（从 [display ... 到本部分的末尾）。你可以使用名称轻松找到它（看下面的 last-seen-name）。



在另一台主机上打开相同的上述文件并将复制的内容附加到末尾。保存文件。

关闭新主机中的所有应用，包括 GNOME Boxes。

现在打开 GNOME Boxes，你应该会看到你的虚拟机和它的内容一起被移动到新主机中。

你现在可以拥有一个可以轻松携带和移动的便携式虚拟机。请记住，目标机器应该安装了 GNOME Boxes 才能完成这项工作。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Lua 是一个有趣而强大的语言，随着各个版本的推进，功能愈发的强大，开发者群体也在不断的增长。这篇文章我们将探索一下它的各种前景。


Lua 是一个脚本语言，它面向过程、函数式编程，甚至可以是 面向对象的。它使用类 C 语言的语法，但却是动态类型，具有自动内存管理和垃圾回收功能，使用基于寄存器的虚拟机来解释字节码。这些特点使得它对于初学者来说是个很好的语言，同时也是经验丰富的程序员的强大工具。

虽然与 Python 和 JavaScript 相比，Lua 现在已经有点儿黯然失色了，但是 Lua 拥有的一些优点使得它在许多的重大软件项目中很受欢迎。Lua 很容易嵌入到其他语言当中， 这意味着你可以在（例如）Java 编写的代码中包含 Lua 文件，就像原生的 Java 代码一样运行。这听起来就像魔法一般，现在有许多项目如 luaj 使得其成为可能，之所以可以实现，正是因为 Lua 就是为此而设计的。部分出于这种灵活性，你可以在许多游戏、图形应用的程序中发现 Lua 脚本的身影。

就像其他任何事情一样，做到完美是需要时间的，但 Lua 是很易于学习（并且有趣）的语言。它是一种一致的语言、一种带有有用的错误消息的友好的语言，并且可以在网上轻松找到许多有用的资料。那么就让我们开始吧！

安装 Lua

在 Linux 下，你可以使用发行版自带的包管理来安装 Lua。例如，在 Fedora、CentOS、 Mageia、OpenMandriva 以及类似发行版中：

$ sudo dnf install lua


在 Debian 以及基于 Debian 的系统中：

$ sudo apt install lua


对于 Mac，你可以使用 MacPorts 或者 Homebrew：

$ sudo port install lua

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So I don't know is this the sub i should write, and I hope the flair is the right one. I am a first-year student in math and computer science at a uni. I am using Linux for 6 years or something like that and haven't even touched the windows for 2 years. I have above average knowledge about Linux, at least I think so.
 Last week, the manager of computer lab and teacher said there is students that gives courses in the lab, there are courses like python, web development, unity and I would like you to give Linux course. And I said why not. Now I don't know what to do. How should I proceed and what I am going to teach for 1 year (1 hour/week). I looked up to some playlists on YouTube like "Linux for Beginners" and they are teaching a little bit about terminal usage. But I will teach to volunteers and noobs. I should get their attention. How can I get their attention and make a Windows user thinking about giving a try to GNU/Linux. I want to show people that you can use GNU/Linux as a casual user. Linux is not scary and hard. The advantages of open source. And then the terminal usage. Now there is the other question, I learn Linux, okay, but why I should learn the terminal usage, how the OS works and some technical things. I can just use GUI. You get me, I hope. Then what should be the curriculum be? 
 I wanted to get your opinions. Thanks for responses. And sorry, English is not my first language.

files; the stream of commits in a Git repository
reflects the change history of those files.  What is seen in Git, though, is the
final form of those commits; the changes that the patches themselves went
through on their way toward acceptance are not shown there.  That history
can have value, especially while changes are still under consideration.
The proposed git

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[11月12日零时，第14届天猫双11收官。天猫表示，今年天猫双11稳中向好，交易规模与去年持平，但天猫方面未透露具体GMV（成交总额）。据悉，2021年11月12日，天猫发布双11战报，截至2021年11月12日零点，总交易额为5403亿元。今年也是阿里历史上首次未公布成交总额数字。


京东同样未公布今年双11的GMV，去年京东累计下单金额超3491亿元。


“京东黑板报”微信公号发布的信息显示，截至11月11日晚23时59分，京东超越行业增速，创造了新的纪录，与此同时，零售购物用户数也再创佳绩，但具体是怎样的增速，新增了多少用户，京东方面并未进一步披露。


这一决定早有迹象，在11月11日下午举行的媒体沟通会上，天猫方面开场就主动提到了变化：过去的GMV大屏幕不见了，屏幕上取而代之的是今年最重要的数字：1，今年天猫双十一要“多做一点”，呈现更多暖意、善意、绿意。


淘宝直播在今年双11前夕迎来了新的发展，罗永浩、遥望科技入淘，出现了大量中腰部商家，过亿直播间比去年翻了一番。杨光也对外披露了直播交易额的增长情况，截至11月10日，新主播预售引导成交同比增长近684%，腰部主播预售引导成交同比增长365％、直播机构预售引导成交同比增长165%。


今年年中，新冠疫情复发导致的供应链中断与消费信心疲软，对消费市场产生冲击。作为新消费品牌的代表，三顿半创始人吴骏表示，今年品牌一个很重要的变化是，从从新消费到价值消费。


过去，新是品牌的增长利器。“但新是有保鲜期的，并非能一直持续。当滤镜退去后，消费变得理性客观，现在用户拿着放大镜消费，关注价格这些客观标准的动作。”吴骏强调，当流量的红利逐渐消退，品牌也要提高自身价值，滤镜消费过去后，要从产品交付的全流程、全触点关注用户体验，才能赢得用户肯定。

I am going to talk about “SafeSetID”. By the way, if you want to read the writeup about LSM you can use the following link — https://medium.com/@boutnaru/linux-security-lsm-linux-security-modules-907bbcf8c8b4.
 Overall “SafeSetID” is an LSM that was merged in kernel 5.1. The goal of “SafeSetID” is to restrict the transitions to target UID/GID from current UID/GID based on a system wide whitelist. Thus, it governs the family of syscalls which allows those types of transitions (like seteuid and setegid. In general set*uid/set*gid).
 One of the most used use-cases for “SafeSetID” is to enable a non-root application to transition to other untrusted UIDs/GIDs with…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[一家神秘公司掌握着一个主流 SSL 根证书机构

据报道，Chrome、Safari、Firefox 和其他浏览器都接受一家名为 TrustCor 的根证书机构（CA）。CA 是互联网基础设施的基石，它签署的 SSL 证书可以保证网站不是假的，流量是加密的。因而，CA 可以签发“伪造”证书从而劫持加密流量。此外，该公司在巴拿马的注册记录显示，其信息与今年被确认的一家的间谍软件制造商相同，文件显示，该公司十多年来一直向美国政府机构出售通信拦截服务。Mozilla 表示它可能会取消 TrustCor 的根证书。


消息来源：华盛顿邮报



老王点评：谷歌当年就因为有根 CA 滥用而取消过该根 CA 证书，看看这次谷歌会如何？




GitHub 实验 “Hey, GitHub!” 语音编程

GitHub Next 团队宣布了一项新的实验：“Hey, GitHub!”，允许与 Copilot 进行语音互动。也就是说，你甚至不需要使用键盘就可以让 VSCode 为你提供编程建议。GitHub 称，该实验可以识别“自然语言”。除了编写和编辑代码，它还允许程序员进行代码导航和执行其它 VSCode 命令。

老王点评：连键盘都不用了，直接讲你要干啥就好了。




美国国家安全局敦促各组织转向内存安全编程语言

美国国家安全局（NSA）表示，建议各组织通过利用 C#、Go、Java、Ruby 或 Swift 等语言内存安全编程语言进行战略性转变。NSA 表示“内存管理问题已经被利用了几十年，今天仍然很常见。”软件内存安全问题是约 70% 的漏洞背后的原因。不良的内存管理也会导致技术问题，如不正确的程序结果，随着时间的推移程序性能的下降，以及程序崩溃。

老王点评：建议是好的，但是 NSA 不太值得信任。]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[VLC 媒体播放器是 最好的媒体播放器 之一。这款跨平台播放器功能丰富，可以播放任何可用的媒体格式。

你会惊讶地发现 VLC 不仅仅是一个视频播放器。它可以对你的媒体文件做很多事情。

我们分享过 使用 VLC 下载 YouTube 视频 的 VLC 技巧。

让我再和你分享一个。用 VLC 裁剪视频怎么样？这不是 裁剪视频 的最佳方式，但它可以作为一个选择使用。

使用 VLC 裁剪视频

在 VLC 中裁剪视频本质上意味着从所需部分的开头到结尾录制视频。默认情况下，录制控制工具通常在 VLC 面板中不可见。

让我详细介绍一下步骤。

步骤 1：启用高级控件

要获取控件，你需要使其在主控制面板上可见。

首先选择“视图View”选项，然后选中“高级控件Advanced Controls”复选框。现在，如截图所示，出现了带有几个按钮的新控件行。



步骤 2：打开视频

为了裁剪视频，你需要在 VLC 中打开它。你可以通过“媒体Media > 打开文件Open File”在 VLC 播放器中打开视频：



或者你可以使用 Nautilus 文件管理器中的 VLC 打开视频文件：



步骤 3：使用 VLC 的录制功能裁剪视频

打开视频文件后，将时间线设置为所需输出的起点并暂停视频。之后，按“录制”按钮并播放视频。



当达到所需输出的终点时，暂停视频并再次按下“录制”按钮停止录制。



这应该将裁剪后的输出保存到你的 ~/Videos 目录中。



故障排除：无法识别的输出文件

VLC 以 .ts 文件格式录制视频。这在 VLC 中受支持，你可以根据需要使用它。但是 Ubuntu 中的许多其他播放器，包括本地视频播放器，都无法识别该格式。因此，在这种情况下，有两种解决方案。

Gnome-Video 提示安装 GStreamer 包

当你尝试打开文件时，GNOME-Videos 会提示错误并建议安装 Gstreamer 多媒体编解码器。



你可以点击上图所示的 “在 Ubuntu 软件应用中查找Find in Ubuntu Software” 按钮，这将打开 Ubuntu 软件中心。你可以在那里安装所需的编解码器包。



同样安装 Gnome-videos 并使用它打开视频将解决问题。

使用 VLC 转换视频文件

如果你不想为此安装任何额外的软件包，你可以使用 VLC 本身将 .ts 文件转换为 mp4 格式以在任何其他播放器中播放。

为此，打开 VLC 并在“媒体Media”菜单下选择“转换/保存Conver/Save”选项。



现在，使用“添加Add”按钮提供需要转换的文件的位置，然后选择“转换/保存Conver/Save”，如截图所示。



选择所需的输出配置（MP4）并为输出设置文件名，然后按“开始Start”。



这将开始转换，并根据源的时长决定转换时间。完成后，你可以从 ~/Videos 目录访问转换后的输出。



总结

虽然确实可以使用 VLC 播放器来裁剪视频，但整个过程与专门的 视频编辑器 完全不同。

最大的问题是你需要观看所有裁剪部分才能完成裁剪，如果你要裁剪跨越数分钟的视频的一大部分，这就不方便了。

无论如何，这个很酷的功能在某些情况下可能是一个方便的工具，比如你想要的只是裁剪一个特定的小剪辑或从电影场景中制作一个 Gif。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[在这篇文章中，我们会介绍迄今为止所有 Ubuntu 发行版本的吉祥物。


你可能已经注意到了：每个 Ubuntu 版本都会有一个版本名称和代号。代号由两个单词组成，这两个单词有相同的首字母，第一个单词是形容词，另一个单词通常是一个濒危的物种名称。

对应于其代号，这些 Ubuntu 版本也有一个吉祥物。例如，Ubuntu 22.04 的代号为 “Jammy Jellyfish”，因此 Ubuntu 22.04 的桌面壁纸上有 吉祥物：水母 的图像。

但是实际上，这些“吉祥物”并不总是 Ubuntu 版本的一部分，因为吉祥物在早期的 Ubuntu 版本中是没有的。

有史以来第一个 Ubuntu 版本是在 2004 年 10 月发布的 4.10 版（LCTT 译注：Ubuntu 的版本号是由年份和月份的组合来表示的。）但是，直到 Ubuntu 8.04 LTS “Hardy Heron” 版本，你才会看到相关的吉祥物。

在我之前写的 另一篇文章 中，我整理了所有 Ubuntu 版本的默认壁纸。在本文中，你将了解到所有 Ubuntu 版本的吉祥物。

现在，就让我们按时间倒序，一起进入 Ubuntu 的吉祥物之旅吧。

（LCTT 校注：本文原文发表时，Ubuntu 22.10 尚未发布，它的代号是 “Kinetic Kudu”，吉祥物是“捻角羚”。）

（LCTT 校注：由于 Ubuntu 系列的代号和吉祥物选择的都是比较少见的动物和晦涩的描述，因此尽管译者和校对虽然尽力了，但是应该还有谬误。我觉得原文作者为了找出这些说明也尽力，恐怕真正权威的诠释只有 Canonical 才能给出吧。）

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all,
We're Fabienne and Ewan of Climacrux. Today we're proud to launch our latest project to try and make carbon dioxide removal as accessible as possible: CDR Platform [1].
In short: it’s an API to connect to a portfolio of carbon removers. You can purchase from as low as a single gram and select from both natural and technological removal methods.
Longer: A couple of years ago we launched an alternative to carbon credits, Carbon Removed[2], designed for individuals to buy and subscribe to CDR. But we always had the nagging thought that there was more that could be done.
CDR Platform is our foundation for that - a simple API to get prices and purchase (at the moment). Our plan is to become the Stripe of the carbon removal ecosystem, seamlessly connecting the supply to the demand.
We’d love to hear your feedback. Do you see a use case for this and would you use it? What features have we missed? Do you understand what we’re doing and if not, what’s unclear? We’d love to hear from you.[3]
Many thanks and happy hacking, Climacrux.
P.s. If you are a carbon remover, send us your prices, life cycle analysis and some more information about your removal timeline. Our aim is to bring your services to a wider audience so you can focus on reducing our CO₂ levels. Thanks for your work!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Today I'm launching Postcard!
I started Postcard when I deleted most social media, but still wanted a way to keep in touch with friends and my network.
When I worked at Webflow, it became clear to me that most website builders are way too complex for individual users. So, I drew inspiration from social media - where all you need is a couple photos and text fields to get a great site online. So, I think I’ve about achieved a site builder that even my Mom could use.
The product seems simple, but there are many under-the-hood optimizations. There's caching, CDNs, custom domain support, TLS certificate issuance + management, dynamically-generated open graph images, image optimizations, email sending, full-text RSS feed, email reputations, and more. It also uses a couple new products to make the domain connection process easy.
Let me know if you have any feedback or questions!
PS - Rumor is that Twitter is shutting down Revue. If you want help transferring content and subscribers over to Postcard, just email me!

I switched to cinnamon because I was getting tired of when my distro breaks either by user error or drivers not installing correctly, Nvidia. I heard after that, Latte was no longer in development. That crushed me as I loved Latte on Plasma. I've seen some posts involving plasma and was wanting to go back, but the lack of latte made it difficult.
 TL;DR Does Latte have an alt that I can replace latte with, or did someone else take over the project?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[这个由 KDE 开发的功能丰富的文本编辑器正在变得更好和更有用！




Kate 文本编辑器 是一个不断发展和强大的开源文本编辑器，它可以作为微软的 Visual Studio Code 应用程序的替代品。

它可以在 Linux、Windows 和 macOS 上使用。

这个代码编辑器在 2021 年进行了重大升级，这可能使它成为了 KDE 对微软产品的回应。

在即将到来的 Kate 和 KWrite 22.12 版本上，他们的目标是添加许多非常有用的功能。

来简单看看我们可以从 Kate 中期待什么。

🆕 Kate Editor 的新增功能

如果你读了 Nate 的博客 了解 KDE 的改进，你可能已经知道了 KDE Plasma 和应用程序即将获得的升级。

但是，我想强调一些 Kate 22.12 将会带来的令人激动的新功能：


对 Qt 部件的支持

更新的欢迎页面

Git 差异查看器

配置标签页

剪切板历史


欢迎页面

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After talking about LSM (“Linux Security Modules”) it is time to show different technologies which leverage them. I am going to start with LoadPin. By the way, if you want to read the writeup about LSM you can use the following link — https://medium.com/@boutnaru/linux-security-lsm-linux-security-modules-907bbcf8c8b4.
 The goal of LoadPin is to ensure that all the files the kernel can load/execute reside on the same filesystem. The idea is that the filesystem would be based on a read-only device (for example think about a DVD/CD-ROM/any other RO hardware device, it could be also software based (but it has its own drawbacks). You can go over the code of LoadPin in the following link — https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/latest/source/security/loadpin/loadpin.c.
 Among the kernel files artifacts are: kernel modules, firmware, security policies and kexec images (kexec is a syscall which enables loading and booting to a different kernel from the current running one — more on that in a future writeup).
 The way it is done is by trapping the kernel’s file reading interface and basically pinning (it for kernel code loading) to the first file system which is used. Thus, any file that is part of a different filesystem will be rejected — As you can see in the screenshot below.
 One of the use-cases for using LoadPin is to ensure the integrity of kernel code (such as *.ko file) without signing them (I will detail kernel module signing in a different writeup). It is important to note that I am not recommending using/not using LoadPin, my goal is to explain about it (and leave to the reader what to do with it ;-).
 In order to enable LoadPin (which is supported since kernel 4.7) we need to set CONFIG_SECURITY_LOADPIN before building the kernel. If it is enabled we can also toggle it using the kernel command line (“loadpin.enforce=0” or “loadpin.enforce=1”).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[11月10日凌晨，苹果正式向iPhone用户推送了iOS和iPadOS 16.1.1更新（内部版本号：20B101），距离上次发布更新间隔了16天。


这次并没有新功能的加入，只有一些小漏洞的修复，不过额外为国行用户带来了专属功能。


在最新的 iOS 16.2 (20C5043e) 测试版和 iOS 16.1.1 更中，移除了“对所有人 AirDrop”选项，目前仅国行机型有此调整。





也就是说，现在你只能在“关闭 / 仅联系人 / 对所有人开放 10 分钟”三个选项中进行选择。实测需要手动开启“对所有人开放 10 分钟”，开启一次最多只会维持10分钟，随后便会自动关闭，而默认情况下均为“仅联系人能够 AirDrop”，避免在公众场所接收到第三方发送的信息。

虽然 Fedora 37 还没有发布，但是开发人员已经在计划下一个版本。一个新的提案建议提供一个面向移动设备的 Phosh 镜像，用于运行专注于智能手机和平板电脑的 Wayland shell，同时提供一个良好的基于 GNOME 的体验。另外预计也会引入一个带有 KDE Plasma Mobile 的镜像。Fedora 38 预计明年春天发布。

罗马法院要求 Cloudflare 的 DNS 封锁 BT 网站

罗马法院已经确认，Cloudflare 必须通过其公共的 1.1.1.1 DNS 解析器阻止三个 BT 网站。Cloudflare 并不反对阻止针对其客户网站的请求，但认为干扰其 DNS 解析器是有问题的，因为这些措施不容易在地理上加以限制，将影响封锁该政府管辖范围以外的终端用户。


消息来源：Slashdot



老王点评：DNS 作为互联网流量入口的方向标，屡屡被用来做各种滥用。已经习惯了，不是吗？




15000 个网站被黑帽 SEO 利用

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This feature has been a part of Microsoft Windows for ages.
 I am genuinely curious as to why we have such a feature disparity on something that ought to be essential, especially given how easily somebody or an update can bork an installation..
 I just finished setting up Snapper with btrfs-grub. It is okay. But, honestly, this is another reason I really wish we'd stop pushing desktop to gamers.
 This software is far from ready for mass markets like gaming.
 It takes hours of learning/typing commands and testing these 3rd party projects just to be sure they work. The worst part is always it might get broken on some update.
 ​
 I do however appreciate all the work going into projects like snapper and btrfs-grub. But, it is hardly smooth. Grub still doesn't update automatically when new snapshots are made. Looks like the btrfs-grub git hasn't been updated in about a year which is a shame. This is a feature I've been hoping would come around.
 ​
 Basic features like this missing, I wonder why there is little to no focus on them. Instead we keep adding desktops and more distros. 
 ​
 I know where my money would be spent if I won the lottery.
 I'd invest millions in these sorts of features.
 Any similar features you wish were just there with linux desktops?

 Any time I've been addicted to something in the past, I've found that completely removing the possibility of doing it works the best.
 Is there some way to completely block games from running on my system? I of course want superuser privileges on my own computer, but if there was a way to change permissions on some important file needed for Steam and give the password to change permission to a friend, that would be sweet.
 Or could I sudo rm -rf some directory that has binaries needed to run it? I feel like there's got to be a way. Just uninstalling the game doesn't work since it reinstalls super easily.

 I was looking at some metrics and Linux's marketshare on the desktop grew from 0.8% in November 2012 to 2.7% in November 2022. That's a 3x increase in the span of a decade. Windows is down 15.64% and macOS is went up by 7.78%. There is also "Unknown", which has historically varied between 3% and 6% and must contain a majority of Windows users (considering how close it follows Windows' ups and downs), plus some Mac and Linux users who are using browsers and extentions to prevent tracking. With that in mind, Linux could be at 3%.
 I thought it would be cool to share this info.
 For anyone interested in the methodology they use, here's an FAQ: https://gs.statcounter.com/faq#methodology

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[使用 Lua 配置持久化应用设置。


不是所有的应用都需要配置文件；对很多应用来说，在启动时变得焕然一新对它们更有利。例如，简单的工具就极少需要偏好项和设置在使用过程中保持稳定不变。然而，当你编写一个复杂的应用程序时，如果能让用户设置与应用的交互方式，以及应用与系统交互的方式会很不错。这就是配置文件用来做的事情。本文将讨论一些利用 Lua 进行持久化配置的方法。

选择一种格式

关于配置文件很重要的两点是一致性和可预见性。你不会希望为了保存用户偏好项，将信息转储到文件中，然后再花几天去编码实现“逆向工程”，处理最后出现在文件里的随机信息。

这里用一些常用的 配置文件格式。Lua 有一些库可以处理大多数常用的配置格式；在本文中，我会采用 INI 格式。

安装库

Lua 库的核心仓库是 Luarocks.org。你可以在这个网站搜索库，或者你可以安装并使用 luarocks 终端命令。

Linux 环境中，你可以从发行版的软件仓库中下载它，例如：

$ sudo dnf install luarocks


在 macOS 上，请使用 MacPorts 或者 Homebrew。在 Windows 上，请使用 Chocolatey。

luarocks 安装后，你可以使用 search 子命令来搜索一个恰当的库。如果你不知道库的名字，可以通过关键词来搜索这个库，例如 ini、xml或者json，这取决于你想要用这个库做什么。打个比方，你可以搜索inifile`， 这个库被我用来解析 INI 格式的文本文件。

$ luarocks search inifile
Search results:
inifile

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[开源的 PSCP 程序可以轻松地在 Windows 和 Linux 计算机之间传输文件和文件夹。


你是否正在寻找一种将文件从 Windows 计算机快速传输到 Linux 计算机并再次传输回来的方法？开源的 PSCP 程序可以轻松传输文件和文件夹，当然它是开源的。

在 Windows 中设置 PATH

了解如何在 Windows 中设置命令路径可以更轻松地使用 PSCP 等方便的程序。如果你不熟悉该过程，请阅读 如何在 Windows 上设置 PATH。

使用 PSCP

PSCP（PuTTY 安全复制协议）是一个命令行工具，用于将文件和文件夹从 Windows 计算机传输到 Linux 计算机。


从 网站 下载 pscp.exe。

将 pscp.exe 移动到 PATH 中的文件夹（例如，如果你按照 Opensource.com 上的 PATH 教程进行操作，则为 Desktop\App）。如果你没有设置 PATH 变量，你也可以将 pscp.exe 移动到保存要传输的文件的文件夹中。

使用 Windows 任务栏中的搜索栏在 Windows 计算机上打开 Powershell（在搜索栏中输入 powershell。）

输入 pscp -version 以确认你的计算机可以找到该命令。


IP 地址

在进行传输之前，你必须知道目标计算机的 IP 地址或完全限定域名。假设它是同一网络上的计算机，并且你没有运行 DNS 服务器来解析计算机名称，你可以在 Linux 机器上使用 ip 命令找到目标 IP 地址：

[linux]$ ip addr show |grep 'inet '

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After much experimenting, I worked out this solution.
 1) Install the Redirector extension: https://addons.mozilla.org/en-GB/firefox/addon/redirector/
 2) Click the Redirector extension: https://i.imgur.com/GcvmP5Z.png
 3) Click "Edit Redirects": https://i.imgur.com/0iu0O4q.png
 4) Click "Create new redirect": https://i.imgur.com/AixuQyW.png
 5) Set the following redirect Settings (Comments in [brackets]) https://i.imgur.com/TNBJUiS.png
 Description: Whatever you Want [e.g. Youtube to Youtube] Example URL: Any Youtube "watch?v=" link of your choice [e.g. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTrFAY3LUNw] Include Pattern: https:\/\/www\.youtube\.com\/watch\?v=(.+) [The backspaces are important, this is Regex] Redirect to: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=$1 [Note no backspaces here, this too is important] Pattern Type: Regular Expression Click "Show Advanced Options" > Exclude Pattern: ((https:\/\/www\.youtube\.com\/watch\?v=(.+)&(?=.*list.+)).+) 
 Now you can click recommended sidebar links without the AJAX loading screwing up everything.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[At the end of our earlier article on John
Ousterhout's talk at Netdev 0x16, he had concluded
that TCP was unsuitable for data-center environments for a variety of
reasons.  He also argued that there was no way to repair TCP so that it
could serve the needs of data-center networking.  In order for software to
be able 
to use the full potential of today's networking hardware, TCP needs to be
replaced with a protocol that is different in almost every way, he said.
The second 
half of the talk covered the Homa
transport protocol that he and others at Stanford have been working on
as a possible replacement for TCP in the data center.]]></summary>

Metlo works by discovering all your API endpoints, running security tests, and detecting potential attacks. It runs before your APIs go into production, and also in real time, alerting your security team when anomalous usage patterns are detected.  Metlo secures your APIs against the OWASP Top 10 (broken auth, injection, excessive data exposure etc.) and more.
Although APIs are one of the largest attack surfaces in companies today, there aren’t many good security tools to protect them. The few tools currently on the market are “enterprise” only; they require you to talk to a salesperson to use, or even see, the product.

罗马数字是阿拉伯数字传入之前使用的一种数码。其采用七个罗马字母作数字、即I（1）、X（10）、C（100）、M（1000）、V（5）、L（50）、D（500）。罗马数字的记数方法是：相同的数字连写，所表示的数等于这些数字相加得到的数；小的数字在大的数字的右边，所表示的数等于这些数字相加得到的数；小的数字在大的数字的左边，所表示的数等于大数减小数得到的数。


在程序设计的时候，有时候会出现使用正则表达式匹配罗马数字的问题，这里给一下解决方案：


未经验证的罗马数字：


^[MDCLXVI]+$


严格验证罗马数字：


^(?=[MDCLXVI])M*(C[MD]|D?C{0,3})(X[CL]|L?X{0,3})(I[XV]|V?I{ 0,3})$


灵活验证罗马数字：


^(?=[MDCLXVI])M*(C[MD]|D?C*)(X[CL]|L?X*)(I[XV]|V?I*)$


简单的罗马数字：


^(?=[MDCLXVI])M*D?C{0,4}L?X{0,4}V?I{0,4}$


以上正则表达式适用的编程语言： .NET、Java、JavaScript、PCRE、Perl、Python、Ruby]]></summary>

微软提交了一个一百多行的补丁，使 Linux 内核可以在嵌套的微软虚拟化管理程序（MSHV）下运行，即可以在 Hyper-V 虚拟机中运行 Hyper-V 虚拟机。


消息来源：Phoronix

能打败顶尖的围棋 AI 却会输给业余选手

自从 AlphaGo 使用神经网络而通过自我对弈精通围棋后，人类就一败涂地了。研究人员创建了一个对抗性的围棋程序，使用一些超乎常规的下法训练，它在与业余棋手的对弈中败北，但是却可以打败一个顶尖的开源围棋 AI KataGo。KataGo 使用数百万次自我对弈学习围棋，但这仍然不足以覆盖所有可能的情况，留下了可利用的漏洞。研究显示，达到人类水平的 AI 往往会犯一些非常奇怪的错误，以让人类感到惊讶的方式失败。


消息来源：Ars Technica



老王点评：不按套路出牌，连 AI 都受不了。




Linux 内核中出现一个丑陋的“黑科技”

安全研究人员在 Linux 主线内核中发现了一个已经存在三年的“黑科技”：Linux 内核会识别以 “X” 字母开始的进程，并返回“不支持原子模式设置”的错误。这个丑陋的“黑科技”是为了解决旧版本的 X.Org 服务器中的一个错误。但由于没有人愿意再维护 X11，于是这个补丁的提交者觉得，与其修复有问题的代码，不如调整内核以绕开。但事实上这只是检查第一个字母是否是 “X”，扩大了打击面，因为不是所有以 “X” 开头的进程都是 X.Org 的进程。


消息来源：Phoronix



老王点评：这样丑陋的代码显然会被 Linus 破口大骂的，不知道怎么悄悄潜入到内核当中的。]]></summary>

 After a break of 8 years, my wife wants to enter into the IT workforce again. She has 1-2 years experience as a Java developer. She would like to start with Linux certification as a first step to get back into the IT. 
 We feel it is better to work towards a basic (first) Linux certification so that there is some target to reach and set path to follow. 
 Can you please suggest what is the Linux certification she can do as an absolute beginner? Also, some structured training material tips would be of great help.

 I have a couple very early gen Raspberry Pis and I love to play with them, but the idea of something with an open source CPU is very cool. There are a bunch of different distros that can be installed on the Raspberry Pis, most have a desktop, a couple server ones have just a TUI. But it seems like there's only ubuntu server out there for RISC-V boards. I was hoping for some simple distro with a lightweight desktop like AntiX or LXLE but can't find anything. Do they just not exist?

It was mainly designed to allow implementation of MAC (Mandatory Access Control) with minimal changes to the Linux kernel. For now, you should know that MAC is an organizational-wide security policy that users can’t override (I am going to post about MAC and DAC in more detail separately).
 Despite the name containing “Modules” it is not implemented as loadable kernel modules (“.ko” files). The LSM framework is of course optional and needs to be enabled by the CONFIG_SECURITY variable.

最近我写了一个使用 Groovy 脚本来清理我的音乐文件中的标签的系列。我开发了一个 框架，可以识别我的音乐目录的结构，并使用它来遍历音乐文件。在该系列的最后一篇文章中，我从框架中分离出一个实用类，我的脚本可以用它来处理文件。

这个独立的框架让我想起了很多 awk 的工作方式。对于那些不熟悉 awk 的人来说，你学习下这本电子书：


《awk 实用指南》


我从 1984 年开始大量使用 awk，当时我们的小公司买了第一台“真正的”计算机，它运行的是 System V Unix。对我来说，awk 是非常完美的：它有关联内存associative memory——将数组视为由字符串而不是数字来索引的。它内置了正则表达式，似乎专为处理数据而生，尤其是在处理数据列时，而且结构紧凑，易于学习。最后，它非常适合在 Unix 工作流使用，从标准输入或文件中读取数据并写入到输出，数据不需要经过其他的转换就出现在了输入流中。

说 awk 是我日常计算工具箱中的一个重要部分一点也不为过。然而，在我使用 awk 的过程中，有几件事让我感到不满意。

可能主要的问题是 awk 善于处理以分隔字段呈现的数据，但很奇怪它不善于处理 CSV 文件，因为 CSV 文件的字段被引号包围时可以嵌入逗号分隔符。另外，自 awk 发明以来，正则表达式已经有了很大的发展，我们需要记住两套正则表达式的语法规则，而这并不利于编写无 bug 的代码。一套这样的规则已经很糟糕了。

由于 awk 是一门简洁的语言，因此它缺少很多我认为有用的东西，比如更丰富的基础类型、结构体、switch 语句等等。

相比之下，Groovy 拥有这些能力：可以使用 OpenCSV 库，它很擅长处理 CSV 文件、Java 正则表达式和强大的…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[打算为你的项目开发工作安装 Python 3.11？下面是如何在 Ubuntu 等发行版中安装 Python 3.11 的方法。




Python 3.11 于 2022 年 10 月 25 日发布，并声称比之前的 Python 3.10 版本快 10% - 60%。

一如既往，3.11 中的功能和改进列表明显较多。下面是一个简介：


错误回溯更明确，可以指出导致错误的确切语句。

引入异常组和新的 except* 语法。

你可以在基础表达式中添加自定义文本，以便在你的代码中更好地处理错误。

引入 Variadic 泛型，允许在 Python 数值库（如 NumPy）中使用类似数组的结构。

字典类型 TypedDict 得到了改进，现在你可以指定个别字典项目是必须的还是可选的。

引入了 Self 注解，允许类返回它们自己的类型实例。


还有很多，你可以在官方的 3.11 亮点页面 上详细了解。

Linux 发行版中的当前 Python 版本

Ubuntu 22.04 LTS 带有 Python 3.10，而最近发布的 Ubuntu 22.10 Kinetic Kudu 也是同样的版本。然而， Kinetick Kudu 可能会在几周内采用 3.11。

另外，Fedora 37 已经有了 Python 3.11 RC2，并将提供该版本。

所以，如果你正在运行 Ubuntu 22.04 LTS、Linux Mint 21 或任何基于 Ubuntu-LTS 的发行版，这里是你如何通过 PPA 安装 Python 3.11 的方法。

注意：谨慎地使用这个方法。确保你知道你在做什么，因为替换 Linux 发行版的基础 Python 版本可能会导致系统不稳定。许多默认的应用程序和软件包都依赖于 3.10 版本。

Cody, Reshma, and Rahul here and we’re building Medplum (https://www.medplum.com), an open-source platform that lets you quickly build complex healthcare applications. We provide a headless EHR (electronic health record) that supports common standards like FHIR, HL7 and more. You build whatever UI and UX you want, and we handle the infrastructure and give you lots of interoperability and automation tools.
The digital healthcare space has been hampered by proprietary tech, walled gardens, and vendor lock-in. Working as healthcare app developers ourselves, we kept seeing organizations developing the same infrastructure over and over.

 I installed the amdgpu-install package from the PPA, and running sudo amdgpu-install --usecase="hip" was successful in grabbing all the dependencies (unlike with the deb you can download directly from the AMD website), but when it came to building amdgpu-dkms I was told that my kernel--6.0.7--wasn't supported.
 I'm fine downgrading back to 6.0, but given all the improvements recently released to the open source driver that's directly in the kernel, I don't want to go back any further.
 Is there any way to get access to Blender GPU rendering, the AMF encoder and OpenCL support on Linux while also using the latest kernel (and thus open source driver) for everything else?
 I'm using a highly stripped down Ubuntu 22.04 as a base, and I'm absolutely open to distro-hopping if this is trivial to do in, say, Arch.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I was wondering why I should use a rolling release distro? I really like the idea of going through every little step during installation and have everything just how I want it to be. But I do not like to idea of always have the "latest and greatest" versions of my applications. 
 I want to have a stable system as a daily driver where I do not have to struggle with os issues every day.
 Am I missing something? What's the main advantage of rolling releases for a daily driver?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[... unless we do something about our governments. 
 Let's be honest. What's holding free (as in freedom) operating systems so far behind? Are they worse? I don't think so. They might have a bit less hardware support - but most people wouldn't care. They might have a bit less software available (although debatable) - but most people wouldn't care, if it's pinta or paint.net.
 I think, although leaving a room for being mistaken, that the reason for today's Windows popularity is the fact that it's shipped in damn every single laptop (with a few exceptions in a few first world countries). People don't bother to care what their laptop is running on - and it's fair, after all, not everyone is a geek or should be.
 What I suggest, is to force laptop and desktop manufacturers to provide an option with a free OS. It doesn't have to be linux-based, as there's a couple of free non-linux OS. However, the price for this laptop should be lower by the price of Windows license, to ensure actually fair competition. If Microsoft has set a price for Windows, let people choose to pay or not for it.
 Again, free as in freedom, not as in unpaid. Although I don't know right now how to ensure that manufacturers don't exploit it (by installing some CandyCrushOS as an option to force people back into Windows ), but I do believe there's a solution.
 I think the actual outcome here will be that instead of single Windows, people will be running all kinds of operating systems, be that gnu/linux, other linux, or gnu/non-linux, or BSD, or many many more! Yet, since we're talking about free software and no dominating system, most software will be available for all systems, so we won't have a problem that something works for one system but not another one. I do believe it's possible.
 Thoughts?

        <link href="https://www.williamlong.info/archives/6985.html"/>
        <updated>2022-11-08T14:32:08.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[11月8日，记者从GPU巨头英伟达处获悉，该公司将于第三季度投产NVIDIA A800 GPU（以下简称“A800”）。根据英伟达的说法，A800是面向中国客户的NVIDIA A100 GPU（以下简称“A100”）替代产品，A800符合美国政府关于出口管制的明确测试，并且不能编程超过该限制。


今年8月底，英伟达发布公告称接到美国政府通知，对英伟达未来向中国出口的A100和即将推出的H100集成电路实施了新的许可要求。随后在公布二季度业绩时，英伟达创始人兼首席执行官黄仁勋提出，会推出不受限制的替代版本。


对业绩增长放缓的英伟达来说，中国市场的重要性不言而喻，毕竟根据财报数据，过去一年里，英伟达从中国业务区获得了71.11亿美元的收入，占公司营收比例达26.4%。


从性能上看，根据英伟达官网介绍，A100可划分为七个GPU实例，提供40GB和80GB显存两种版本，A100 80GB可提供超快速的显存带宽（每秒超过2万亿字节），处理超大型模型和数据集。从目前媒体披露的信息来看，A800芯片数据传输速率为每秒400GB，低于A100，美方新的出口管制规定将芯片数据传输速率限制在每秒600GB。


值得一提的是，随着挖矿热潮的结束，市场对于高端显卡的需求有所下滑。从此前公布的财报数据来看，英伟达2022年二季度营收67亿美元，环比跌幅为19%；净利润6.56亿美元，环比下降59%，降回到两年前同期水准。


早在受限消息传出的9月初，芯谋研究高级分析师张彬磊就曾通过微信及电话向记者介绍，一方面，就目前国内已经商业化的一些GPU跟英伟达的差距来看，需要三至五年时间来“追赶”方能满足市场需求。但另一方面，受限将会促进国产GPU的发展，推动国内相关厂商的崛起。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I created a system for building SVG-only websites called Svija.  But, though the content was nice, the sites felt too static — a bit flat and lifeless. Even a basic HTML website has mouseover effects, but SVG doesn't have them for free the way HTML does.
I wanted to find an easy way to recreate mouseover functionality in SVG. For my first try, I labeled objects in Adobe Illustrator:
  • linkSomeName: an invisible link  (over the link text)
  • mouseoverSomeName: a  mouseover decoration (usually bold or colored text, or an underline), initially hidden

Once I had used it for a bit, I thought that it might be nicer if the effects faded in and out. So, I tried animating the transitions with GSAP. It immediately became clear that there was enormous potential to manage complex animations visually, and I worked over the 
summer to create Svija Vibe.
It's all based on linking Adobe Illustrator object names to the GSAP script. Most basic transformations already work well but there's a lot I'll be able to do to make it even simpler to use.
I'm really excited about it! I've only just started but I have a million ideas about how to make it more capable — the big one being the ability to chain animations together.
There's a support document at https://tech.svija.love/how/animation that gives more detail about exactly what can be done.
Svija Vibe is free. It works with Svija, which is also free, but you do need to create an account to use it (Maconly, at least for the next three months).

It's a chrome extension that allows discussion on any webpage to happen there itself.
Currently I have built threaded comments, and a upvote/downvote system.
Plus I've built this cool feature called Highlights, which lets you discuss specific lines in any documentation. As well as a feature called Top Hightlights, which shows the most interesting hightlights on any webpage.
Hope you guys will try it out. And if you have any questions, feel free to ask me here.
Thanks.

        <updated>2022-11-08T12:25:23.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi HN, I have been making this Cozo database since half a year ago, and now it is ready for public release.
My initial motivation is that I want a graph database. Lightweight and easy to use, like SQLite. Powerful and performant, like Postgres. I found none of the existing solutions good enough.
Deciding to roll my own, I need to choose a query language. I am familiar with Cypher but consider it not much of an improvement over CTE in SQL (Cypher is sometimes notationally more convenient, but not more expressive). I like Gremlin but would prefer something more declarative. Experimentations with Datomic and its clones convinced me that Datalog is the way to go.
Then I need a data model. I find the property graph model (Neo4j, etc.) over-constraining, and the triple store model (Datomic, etc.) suffering from inherent performance problems. They also lack the most important property of the relational model: being an algebra. Non-algebraic models are not very composable: you may store data as property graphs or triples, but when you do a query, you always get back relations. So I decided to have relational algebra as the data model.
The end result, I now present to you. Let me know what you think, good or bad, and I'll do my best to address them. This is the first time that I use Rust in a significant project, and I love the experience!

现年 32 岁的 James Zhong 在 2012 年利用快存快取的方式从丝绸之路非法获取了 5 万枚比特币。他窃取的比特币当时只值 65 万美元，现在价值已超过 33 亿美元。去年 11 月，美国执法部门搜查了他的住处，查获了约 5 万枚比特币。这次扣押是当时美国司法部历史上最大的加密货币扣押。周一美国司法部宣布，James Zhong 已承认电信欺诈。

被下载了数千次的偷取密码的 Python 软件包

安全研究专家在 PyPi 上发现了 30 多个恶意 Python 软件包，试图安装 W4SP，这是一个可以从浏览器会话中偷取密码和 Cookie 的脚本。这些恶意软件包的名字听起来很普通，比如 typeutil、colorwin 等等。攻击者通常会复制一个现有的软件包，并稍作修改，以使用户错误输入时无意中安装了恶意软件。

老王点评：虽然 PyPi 已经做了一些工作，但是显然还是为恶意行为留下了广阔空间。




微软在 Windows 11 的注销菜单中显示广告

根据用户反馈的截图，微软在 Windows 11 的注销菜单中宣传其 OneDrive 文件托管服务，并提示用户创建或完成他们的微软账户。不过，看起来这可能只是针对特定群体的 A/B 测试。微软以前也在文件资源管理器、开始菜单等处发布过各种广告。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[有关 Xfce 4.18 的核心和原生应用程序的功能的全面介绍。


经过近两年的开发，Xfce 4.18 将在 2022 年圣诞节期间发布。作为 Xfce 4.16 以来的重要的版本，其一直在开发标签 4.17 下进行开发，以增强这个轻量级桌面。

考虑到 GTK4 的更新、初步的 Wayland 支持，以及核心和本地应用程序的改进，Xfce 4.18 是一个重要的里程碑版本，其带来了大量更新。

从发布时间来看，第一个 Xfce 4.18 预发布版（pre1）已经发布。2022 年 12 月的第一周会有另一个预发布版。而 Xfce 4.18 的最终版本预计将在 2022 年 12 月 15 日至 12 月 29 日之间发布。

由于目前还没有官方的详细介绍，我在这篇文章中总结了 Xfce 4.18 的基本和主要功能。

请继续阅读。



Xfce 4.18 的新功能

1、核心库更新

Xfce 4.18 的依赖关系有所改变，并使用以下版本进行编译：


glib-2.0 >= 2.66

gtk >= 3.24

libcairo >= 1.16

gdk-pixbuf-2.0 >= 2.40

gobject-introspection >= 1.66


2、桌面和面板

顶部的主面板带来了新的设置和调整。但整体外观仍与以前的 4.16 版本中的一样。一些默认的面板小程序在这个版本中也有变化。桌面图标、右键上下文菜单和项目保持不变。

面板的首选项设置有两个新的选项。首先，面板的长度现在以像素设置，而不是百分比。其次，一个新的选项，“保持面板在窗口上方Keep panel above windows” ，可以让你将窗口对话放到面板后面。之前，应用程序的窗口只能达到面板的边缘。



彻底修改了时钟小程序的设置。是的，你…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[了解 Ansible 的新徽标是如何根据相关人员的意见开发的，以确保整个项目的品牌一致性。




作为红帽的用户体验（UX）设计和 Ansible 产品团队的交互设计师，我们花了大约 6 个月的时间为 Ansible 社区设计了一系列徽标。这件事其实在更早的时候就开始了，当时一位项目经理要求我们为一个幻灯片提供一个 “快速而简单” 的徽标。在收集了一些需求后，我们在几天内就向相关人员展示了一个徽标，而且没有经过太多调整。几个月后，另一个相关人员说他们也需要类似的徽标，所以我们重复了这个过程。

于是，我们注意到一个模式：像这样的徽标资源不仅仅代表个人的要求，而是整个 Ansible 项目的共同需要。在完成了几个徽标要求后，我们有了一系列临时的设计，但在没有意识到品牌和设计惯例的情况下，这可能给整个 Ansible 的品牌视觉造成了不一致。随着这个徽标系列的增加，我们认识到了这个迫在眉睫的问题，并需要解决它。

我们的解决方案是创建一个 Ansible 设计系统，这是一个针对品牌的资源，可以指导未来一致的徽标设计。

什么是设计系统？

设计系统是一个可重复使用的资源和指导方法的集合，有助于告知任何数字产品套件的视觉语言。设计系统创造了一些模式，将独立的产品整合在一起，并通过可扩展性和一致性提升品牌。

特别是在一个有多种产品的大公司里，如果没有标准化，扩展起来就不容易，因为不同的团队对每个产品都有贡献。设计系统可以作为每个团队建立新资产的基线。有了标准化的外观和感觉，产品在整个组合中被统一为一个家族。

从头构建一个设计系统

在收到相关人员提出的为 Ansible 开源社区（如 Ansible Builder、Ansible Runner 和Project Receptor）创建徽标的一系列要求后，我们决定为我们的工作流程设计一个结构，并创建一个单一…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[本指南旨在帮助你在 Firefox、Chrome、Chromium 和 Edge 等流行的网页浏览器中启用深色模式。


我们都喜欢深色模式。与标准浅色模式相比，许多人更喜欢它。许多桌面应用原生提供深色模式，而一些应用则是通过桌面环境的底层模式适应深色模式。

不可否认，我们都在网页浏览器上花费了很多时间。我们很少使用桌面应用（除非你从事专门的工作，例如视频编辑等）。因此，当你花费大量时间在浏览器中阅读和学习时，你始终可以选择深色模式。不过，对于网页浏览器，启用深色模式的方法略有不同。

本指南为你提供了在 Firefox、Chromium、Chrome 和 Edge 浏览器中启用深色模式的简单步骤。

在网页浏览器中启用深色模式

在 Firefox 中启用深色模式

打开 Firefox 并点击右上角的菜单。

单击 “设置Settings > 扩展和主题Extension and Themes”。

选择 “深色主题Dark Theme” 并点击 “启用enable”。你应该会看到深色模式已应用于 Firefox。



在 Firefox 浏览器中启用深色模式



深色模式下的 Firefox

要将其还原，请按照相同的步骤并选择浅色主题。

Chromium 和 Chrome 中的深色模式

默认情况下，Chromium 或 Chrome 不会预安装任何深色主题。因此，你需要前往 Chrome 应用商店并下载你想要的深色主题。对于本指南，我会推荐超过一百万用户使用的 “Morpheon Dark” 主题。

从 Chromium 浏览器打开 Morpheon Dark 主题页面（以下链接）。


Chrome 应用商店中的 Morpheon Dark 主题


点击 “添加到 ChromeAdd To Chrome” 按钮。它应该会在 Chrome 中启用。

你可能想探索 Chrome 应用店中提供的其他深色或浅色主题。 访问此页面获取所有深色主题的集合。

但是，你应该要记住的一件事是：此主题不会更改设置或上下文菜单，这是显而易见的。因为它只是改变了浏览器窗口，而这些菜单（有时）是操作系统本身的一部分。



Chromium 深色主题

对 Chrome 浏览器也遵循相同的步骤。

Edge 浏览器 – 深色模式

但是，Edge 浏览器 默认带有更好的深色主题。它允许你从设置中使用 GTK+、浅色和深色模式。

打开 Edge 浏览器，点击右上角的三个小点。

转到 “外观Appearance” 并选择 “深色Dark”。这样应该就好了。

Edge 的这种深色主题实现更好，因为它改变了上下文菜单和地址栏。



深色主题的 Edge

总结

如果你是高级用户，你可能不需要本指南。你可以自己弄清楚。

但我们为所有读者涵盖了所有基础到高级教程。许多新的 Linux 用户可能不知道如何在浏览器中启用深色模式。

所以，就是说，我希望这对你和其他人有帮助。如果你遇到任何问题，请在下面的评论框中告诉我。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Yitang Zhang, the mathematician behind the 2013 breakthrough on bounded gaps in primes, posted to the arxiv today a result which (if correct) comes close to proving the nonexistence of Landau--Siegel zeros: https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.02515.
To give a sense of the scale of this claim: If correct, Zhang's work is the most significant progress towards the Generalized Riemann Hypothesis in a century. Moreover, I think this result would not only be a more significant advance than Zhang's previous breakthrough, but also constitute a larger leap for number theory than Wiles' 1994 proof of Fermat's Last Theorem (which was, in my opinion, the greatest single achievement by an individual mathematician in the 20th century).
Some discussion / explanation of Siegel zeros and Zhang's claim can be found here:

An account of Zhang's remarkable story (and his previous breakthrough) can be found here. Famously, prior to his breakthrough, he worked at Subway and lived in his car:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm curious if there are any paid services that offer to fix Linux issues. Not just a support team--but it would include support. For example, I have a weird issue in Firefox right now where scrolling "sputters" only occasionally, and usually only in Reddit. There are plenty of helpful forums, but I also want to focus on business problems and would rather some other expert could help me fix this in a jiffy.
 I think it would be so cool if I could subscribe for $50/mo to $150/mo to a company that would take my support issues seriously--either help me to resolve them if possible, or if unable, escalate to a team of expert Linux software engineers who could dig into the various systems, subsystems, and open source software code, and fix them. I would happily pay this monthly fee for the assurance that my Linux laptop works beautifully. If my issue results in a software patch, all the better for the community.
 I'm not a corporate customer, so I don't think Redhat Enterprise is a fit here. But maybe someone could correct me if I'm wrong.
 Does something like this exist?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[罗马数字是欧洲在阿拉伯数字传入之前使用的一种数码，现在应用较少。它的产生晚于中国甲骨文中的数码，更晚于埃及人的十进制数字。


罗马数字是阿拉伯数字传入之前使用的一种数码。其采用七个罗马字母作数字、即I（1）、X（10）、C（100）、M（1000）、V（5）、L（50）、D（500）。罗马数字的记数方法是：相同的数字连写，所表示的数等于这些数字相加得到的数；小的数字在大的数字的右边，所表示的数等于这些数字相加得到的数；小的数字在大的数字的左边，所表示的数等于大数减小数得到的数。


在程序设计的时候，有时候会出现使用正则表达式匹配罗马数字的问题，这里给一下解决方案：


未经验证的罗马数字：


^[MDCLXVI]+$


严格验证罗马数字：


^(?=[MDCLXVI])M*(C[MD]|D?C{0,3})(X[CL]|L?X{0,3})(I[XV]|V?I{ 0,3})$


灵活验证罗马数字：


^(?=[MDCLXVI])M*(C[MD]|D?C*)(X[CL]|L?X*)(I[XV]|V?I*)$


简单的罗马数字：


^(?=[MDCLXVI])M*D?C{0,4}L?X{0,4}V?I{0,4}$


以上正则表达式适用的编程语言： .NET、Java、JavaScript、PCRE、Perl、Python、Ruby]]></summary>

I personally find it easier to focus on dead trees, so much so, I'm thinking of investing in a duplex lazer printer and I know it seems very "boomer" and I'm reminded of this Progressive Ad, but I find it to be less distracting and easier to focus. I feel I would better focus on the Arch Wiki or the Gentoo Handbook or ffmpeg docs if it was on dead trees.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[systemd 252 如预期的锁定了 Linux 引导过程

之前，我们 报道 过，systemd 创始人发文指出 Linux 引导过程不安全，并提出采用加密签名的统一内核镜像（UKI），使用 TPM 2.0 硬件加强 Linux 系统启动过程的安全性。UKI 将 Linux 内核和 initrd，以及一些其他的小组件，合并到一个文件中，允许整个文件被加密签名。在刚刚发布的 systemd 252 中，几个重要的功能都与新的 UKI 全签名启动过程有关。除此以外，还很一些重要特性也值得关注。


消息来源：The Register



老王点评：我是觉得 sytemd 有些激进了，虽然确实 systemd 在引入新特性方面进展很快。




Mastodon 用户激增

在埃隆·马斯克接管 Twitter 的一周内，Mastodon 激增了 23 万名用户，月活用户已达 65 万。但与 Twitter 相比，仍然非常少，Twitter 有将近 “2.38 亿日活用户”。其创始人说，“它显然没有 Twitter 那么大，但它是这个网络有史以来最大的。”Mastodon 出现于 2016 年，可以免费使用，也没有广告，由一个非营利组织开发的，并通过众筹获得支持。


消息来源：CNN



老王点评：没用过，也不知道是啥。




Arc 显卡的更新只能在支持英特尔 ME 的系统进行

英特尔管理引擎（ME）是隐藏在英特尔 CPU 中的一个操作系统，它是一个修改版的 MINIX 3，运行在用户根本接触不到的 -3 层。这个事情我们以前 介绍 过。根据 Fwupd 开发者的消息，至少现在，英特尔的 Arc 显卡只能通过 ME 来更新其图形系统控制器的固件。因此，旧的英特尔系统或非英特尔系统，如 AMD、RISC-V 等系统，将无法更新 Arc 显卡的固件。


消息来源：Phoronix



老王点评：这显然是越来越封闭了。从最近的一些趋势来看，一些硬件厂商看似开放，其实本质上还是想各种办法封闭起来。]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[你上次更新通过 Pip 安装的 Python 软件包是什么时候？大多数用户往往会忘记这些 Python 软件包也需要手动更新，因为仅仅更新系统存储库对于软件包来说是不起作用的。

因此，让我们花点时间看看如何使用 Pip，来更新旧的 Python 软件包吧。

如何使用 Pip 升级 Python 软件包

Pip（Pip Installs Packages） 是一个用于管理 Python 软件包的 命令行实用程序command line utility 。你可以将 Pip 安装 Python 软件包，类比为在 Ubuntu 和 Debian 中使用 apt 管理软件包那样。

因此，接下来就让我们深入了解如何使用这个极好的工具 Pip，来管理与 Python 软件包相关的内容吧。

1、列出过时的 Python 软件包

在计划更新什么软件包之前，我们先要列出有哪些过时的软件包，你可以在其中选择想要更新的软件包，因为大多数人不会想一下子更新整个软件包库。

要列出过时的 Python 软件包，你只需将 pip 命令与 list 选项、--outdated 标志一同使用即可，如下图所示：

pip list --outdated




2、升级特定的软件包

获得可更新的软件包列表后，你可以像我之前提到的那样，选择你要更新的那个特定的软件包，pip 升级软件包命令的语法如下：

pip install package_name -U


例如，我想将名为 anime-api 的软件包升级到最新版本，所以我将使用下面的命令来升级：

pip install anime-api -U




3、将软件包升级到特定的版本

没有必要总是使用软件的最新版本，如果你想将软件包升级到不是最新的某个特定版本，参考如下的命令语法：

pip install --upgrade <package>==<version>


例如，我想将名为 xdg 的软件包更新到 5.1 版本，5.1 版本是最新版本的前一个版本，所以可以使用以下命令：

pip install --upgrade xdg==5.1




4、使用 Pip 一次性升级所有软件包

请注意：我不建议你一次性升级所以软件包，因为 Python 软件包的依赖项太复杂了，一次性的升级无法处理相互依赖项。

要一次性升级所有 python 软件包，你可以使用以下命令：

pip3 list --outdated --format=freeze | grep -v '^\-e' | cut -d = -f 1 | xargs -n1 pip3 install -U




上面的命令使用了 xargs。首先，会得到所有需要更新的软件包，然后对每个软件包执行 pip3 install -U 命令。

我在这里使用的是 pip3，而不是 pip。在 Ubuntu 22.04 及更高的版本中，pip 和 pip3 命令都可以使用。

总结

使用 Pip 一次性更新所有 Python 软件包并不是一个好主意。我发现一次性更新后，软件包之间的依赖关系被破坏了，所以请确保只更新你想要更新的软件包。

如果你还有其他的疑问，就请在评论区中留言吧。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[想知道如何在台式机或笔记本电脑上检查 Ubuntu 和其他 Linux 中的 CPU 和硬盘温度？这是一个快速指南。


如果你是普通用户，那么实际上不需要检查 CPU 或 HDD 温度。但是，如果你使用的是非常旧的硬件或轻薄型的硬件，你可能会遇到过热问题。因为这些薄的硬件内部紧密耦合在一起，无论做了多少传热机制，它都会升温。因此，必须监控硬件的温度。然而，现代 Linux 发行版能够通过软件传感器很好地处理过热情况。

在 Ubuntu 上监控 CPU 和硬盘温度的步骤

使用终端

我们将使用几个包来实现相同的目的。在基于 Ubuntu 的系统中打开一个终端并安装以下内容。

sudo apt install hddtemp
sudo apt install lm-sensors


hddtemp 程序为你提供硬盘和 SSD （根据我的测试）的温度。 lm-sensors 包为你提供来自 CPU 和其他通过 PCI 端口访问的传感器的温度详细信息。

安装后，从终端运行以下命令。你需要知道你的磁盘标识符，例如 /dev/sda 或 /dev/sdb 等。

要找出磁盘标识符，你可以使用 fdisk。

sudo fdisk -l


然后运行以下命令检查 HDD 或 SSD 温度。

sudo hddtemp




来自终端的 HDD 或 SSD 温度

检查 CPU 温度和其他信息需要额外的步骤。

首先，运行以下命令，以便传感器程序可以检测到系统中的传感器。

sudo sensors-detect


上面的命令可能会问你一些是/否的问题。继续按回车选择默认选项。

完成后，运行以下命令查看 CPU 和其他接口温度。

sensors




使用传感器

使用 GUI 工具

如果你更喜欢能完成上述所有操作的漂亮 GUI，你可以安装 psensor。该程序适用于 Linux 系统，例如 Ubuntu、Fedora、Arch 和其他变体。它为你提供了漂亮的图形和表格视图：

Ubuntu 及其衍生版：

sudo apt install psensor


Fedora 和基于 RPM 的衍生版：

sudo dnf install psensor


Arch、Manjaro 和类似的衍生版：

pacman -S psensor


安装后，从终端运行 psensor 或从应用菜单启动它。

正如你在下面的截图中所见，它通过漂亮的图表让你可以很好地了解 CPU、GPU 和 HDD 的所有重要温度。使用它的首选项，你可以根据需要对其进行调整。这个轻量级的程序在很多情况下都会很有帮助。



psensor 运行

因此，这些是你可以在 Ubuntu 和其他 Linux 系统中监控 CPU、GPU 或 HDD 温度的一些方法。如果你知道其他方法，请通过下面的评论栏告诉我。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Disclaimer: I've been using Linux for a year now. I've tried Pop, Mint, Manjaro and I'm currently maining Fedora. It's been great and I like it way better than Windows.
 What I love:
 The privacy of Linux, knowing that they aren't using my data for shady purposes has been great. 
 Customizing the desktop to my preferences.
 Using an app store is the way of the future, 1 click installs are way better than downloading exe files off the internet.
 Updating the whole system with 1 click which would take about 30 mins to do for every app on windows.
 Even the most bloated DE is light compared to windows and doesn't kill my PC.
 Open source apps are genuinely great and polished, I've switched to LibreOffice for school work, and so has my university, our PCs now run Ubuntu.

 Anybody have any experience with their software?
 ​
 They mention even having a secure hypervisor, which actually brings to question. How well "hardened" are these hyperisors like Proxmox?
 I don't think Ubuntu comes with anything like Selinux. Which is why I often wished Proxmox would be based on rhel or distro based on that.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have a ton (2-3 TB) of home recorded videos and photos on my debian server, that I would like to view on my Samsung TV using the built in uPNP/DNLA client. I do not need alle kind of weird clients, etc, etc, just for my wife and I to be able to walk down memory lane on the TV. So, I really only need to be able to browse by year/month and have something that lists the entries in date/time order. The video clips are typically less than a couple of minutes long, so they need to be served pretty quick, delays of 10-15 seconds when browsing really kills the experience. 
 I would like a simple service on my debian server, that either runs in a container or from the apt system and automatically transcode the source material to something the TV can understand. However, it seems really complicated, with kodi requiring visual configuration, UMS apparently not very good at transcoding, and so on.
 At this point I would really appreciate some tips to a simple solution that works well with a newish (2021) Samsung TV. I prefer OSS -- what media server should I focus on? Jellyfin? 
 Thanks in advance for any help.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Every time I do a fresh install, I get an itch to just go all FLOSS with my games and not install Steam. But after a little scrolling and maybe a few installs/deinstalls, I realize that the games in the repo are just not up to par.
 One wonders if there is some specific rule that new games just can't fulfill in order to get included in the repo. But that can't be the case because a whole 2 or 3 games actually look presentable. Tux kart looks good and playable, and 0ad is probably the best looking game and the only game I have seen that actually gets good regular updates and it feels like some effort has been put into it. Xonotic is nice, but it couldn't compete even with the game from 1999 it tries to imitate. Super tux is also good.
 A few honourable mentions that look like they tried - the rips of old tycoon games, red alert looks interesting (though I haven't tried it), the absolutely boring and empty minecraft clone, the few city building games...
 And the rest is just on a level below windows 98 minesweeper - projects a student could make as homework. 
 I refuse to believe that there are no people who can make good sprites, good mechanics, and nice-looking games that look and feel like they were made in this century. 
 So, purely logically, if there are 2-3 games that actually look ok-ish, then that means it is possible to put such games in the repo. The question remains why would people rather put their games in the AUR then have them in the repo, which I think is a high honor and good for the users as well because they don't have to mess with the AUR?
 Does the repo maybe require the maker to regularly update the game or something that people are not willing to do? 
 I just don't get it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi HN! We’re building an open-source pricing & packaging engine for SaaS with a built-in billing system. (https://github.com/uselotus/lotus).
We strongly believe pricing is the largest untapped growth lever for SaaS, primarily because pricing affects so many critical systems that don’t talk to each other (billing, payments, feature limits, metering, and CRM). We’re building this infrastructure to fix this and enable quick experimentation.
Lotus acts as a central repository for all of your pricing plans and utilizes your payment gateway, to manage usage-based, per-seat, and custom enterprise pricing. We’re excited to open-source this because we want to enable developers to build their custom pricing and integration edge cases on top of this base.
We’ve launched this repo under an MIT license so any developer can use the tool. Give it a spin for us at either:
* test our cloud version at (https://demo.uselotus.io)
* self-host here (https://github.com/uselotus/lotus) 
and let us know what you think.
All feedback is appreciated! If the project is especially relevant to you, follow us and we’ll keep you updated when we’ve fully published all our beta features.

I still have a lot of things I want to build, but now seemed like a good time to put it out there: even if the results aren’t nearly the quality I’d like, I’ve still found it useful and I want to show it off!
I’ve been working on it since September 2021, but only in fits and starts. The entire thing runs on a computer in my living room (there’s a picture on the About page); I haven’t done any load testing so we’ll see how it holds up.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[据路透社报道，推特5日正式推出全新订阅服务，每月收费8美元，以向用户提供蓝色认证标记(“蓝V”)，同时在苹果应用程序商店App Store推出更新版本。这是马斯克对推特的第一次重大修订。据悉，新服务目前仅供美国、加拿大、澳大利亚、新西兰和英国用户使用。马斯克表示，一旦确认新服务运作良好，并完成相关翻译工作，将会在全球各地推广。


据报道，在针对苹果iOS设备的更新说明中，推特表示，“立即注册”的用户可花费每月7.99美元在他们的用户名称旁边加入广受欢迎的“蓝V认证”，“就像你所追踪的名人、企业和政治人物一样”。


据iOS更新通知，订阅方案的其他好处还包括广告量减半、可上传较长的影片、以及根据内容质量排列推文等。


在马斯克接手推特之前，“蓝V认证”意味着推特确认该帐户的真实身份为个人或公司拥有。但推出全新订阅服务后，目前尚不清楚推特如何在收费之外验证用户的身份。


据悉，这项新服务目前仅提供美国、加拿大、澳大利亚、新西兰和英国用户使用。


马斯克5日发布推文称，“一旦我们确认新服务在首批试行国家运作良好，并完成相关翻译工作，这项服务就会在全球各地正式推出。”

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[GitHub Copilot 被诉“规模空前的软件盗版”

周四，有程序员在旧金山提起诉讼，称其代表数百万可能受每月 10 美元的 Copilot 服务影响的 GitHub 用户。该诉讼旨在挑战 GitHub Copilot 的合法性。诉讼对象包括 GitHub 其所有者微软，以及为该工具提供支持的 OpenAI。该诉讼认为“被告已经侵犯了大量创作者的合法权利，这些创作者在 GitHub 上根据某些开源许可证发布代码或其他作品。”包括 MIT 许可证、GPL 许可证和 Apache 许可证等 11 个流行的开源许可证，都要求注明作者姓名和版权。Copilot 违反并删除这些许可证，“因此，它正在实施规模空前的软件盗版行为。”


消息来源：IT Pro



老王点评：虽然可能是旷日持久的诉讼，但是目前的 AI 没有理会开源许可证就直接拿过来用代码的方式，肯定是有问题的。




经过六年等待，Rust 终于支持通用关联类型了

最新的 Rust 稳定版 1.65.0 支持了通用关联类型（GAT），可以在关联类型上声明生命期、类型和常量泛型。Rust 官方称，“很难用几个字来形容这些东西有多有用。”为了支持 GAT，必须对编译器进行大量的修改，而这项功能的 RFC 是 2016 年提出的。总的来说，GAT 为大量的模式和 API 提供了基础性的依据。大量项目因为 GAT 的稳定而受阻。即使你不需要直接使用 GAT，你所使用的库也很有可能在内部或公开场合使用它，很多时候，GAT 是唯一实现方式。


消息来源：Slashdot



老王点评：Rust 越来越发展完善，真的可以预期成为主要的底层语言。




谷歌计划建立支持世界上 1000 种最常用的语言的 AI 模型

该公司公布了一个经过 400 多种语言训练的 AI 模型，它将其描述为 “目前在语音模型中看到的最大的语言覆盖范围”，并宣布建立一个支持 1000 种语言的模型。谷歌认为，创建一个如此规模的模型将使其更容易将各种人工智能功能带入在线空间和人工智能训练数据集中表现不佳的语言（也被称为 “低资源语言”）。谷歌称，建立单一模型，而不是建立 1000 种不同的模型，有助于 AI 将从高资源语言获得的能力转化为低资源语言的能力。

老王点评：这样的进展，或许过几年，不需要专门学习外语了。]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[安卓的一个重要进展是将安卓开源项目Android Open Source Project（AOSP）移植到 RISC-V 处理器架构。




AOSP 已经开始在上游启用 RISC-V，这将促进 RISC-V CPU 在可穿戴设备、物联网，以及最终在智能手机和笔记本电脑中的使用。

为了开放生态系统，中国科学院 PLCT 实验室的工程师和软件开发人员在 2020 年开始将 Android 10 移植到 RISC-V 架构上。阿里巴巴的云计算部门和平头哥芯片子公司一起努力保持开发与最新的安卓版本同步。

“我们很高兴看到谷歌对构建针对 RISC-V 的 AOSP 的更多支持！阿里云一直致力于通过一系列的创新来支持 RISC-V 社区的发展，比如将安卓的基本功能移植到 RISC-V 上，这证明了在从多媒体到信号处理、设备互联和人工智能等场景中使用基于 RISC-V 的设备的可行性。”阿里云生态系统总监、RISC-V 国际组织的应用与工具水平委员会副主席 David Chen 博士说：“我们期待着与安卓团队合作，为繁荣的 RISC-V 社区做出贡献。”

通过增强 RISC-V 上的安卓系统的基本功能，在 2021 年，阿里云的专家们付出了巨大的努力，积极推动了软件生态系统的发展。 RISC-V on Android 的工作集中在 RISC-V Android 工作组和软件库中进行。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[git log 命令是 Git 中一个很重要的查看提交记录的工具，它也是人们喜欢使用 Git 的原因之一。


git log 命令能够让你了解到更多关于贡献者 提交commit 的记录。使用 git log 的一种方式是按日期查看提交记录 。要查看在指定日期或日期范围内创建的 Git 存储库中的提交记录，请使用带有选项 --since 或 --until 或者同时使用以上两个选项的 git log 命令。

首先，进入你要查看的分支（例如，main 分支）：

$ git checkout main


接下来，你可以使用以下命令，来显示当前日期（即今天）的提交记录：

$ git log --oneline --since="yesterday"


仅显示某一特定用户（例如，用户 Agil）在今天的提交记录：

$ git log --oneline --since="yesterday" --author="Agil"


还可以显示在某一日期范围内的提交记录。使用以下命令，显示在任意两个日期之间（例如，2022 年 4 月 22 日至 2022 年 4 月 24 日）的提交记录：

$ git log --oneline --since="2022-04-22" --until="2022-04-24"


在上面这个例子中，会输出 2022 年 4 月 22 日至 2022 年 4 月 24 日期间，不包括 2022 年 4 月 22 日的所有提交记录。如果你想要包括 2022 年 4 月 22 日的提交记录，请将命令中的 2022-04-22 替换为 2022-04-21。

运行以下命令，能够显示某一特定用户（例如，用户 Agil）在两个指定的日期之间的提交记录：

$ git log --oneline --since="2022-04-22" --until="2022-04-24" --author="Agil"


总结

Git 有很多优点，其中一个优点就是 Git 让你能够收集你项目的相关数据。git log 命令是一个重要的查看提交记录的工具，也是人们喜欢使用 Git 的原因之一！

I've tried altering the dpi and system wide font settings but I end up missing the extra screen real estate too much.
 I've found the Hover Text accessibility feature on Mac to be the perfect solution for this; it renders whatever text your mouse is currently hovering over at a high resolution as long as a key is held down, and I believe the font and contrast can be customized. So far I can't find any such equivalents in my system's package database. The programs I have tried all spawn a persistent window that takes up significant amounts of space, and rather than rendering just the text they instead blow up everything in a specific screen region, resulting in highly pixelated text obscured by irrelevant background noise.
 If a package doesn't already exist for it I would be willing to figure something out myself, even despite a lack of experience. The closest approximation I can think of off-hand would be to make a custom script that spawns an xzoom window on key-press, but that seems kind of fiddly and doesn't address the issue of the pixelated text. Is there a small cli program I can use to grab just the text string itself? Any other solutions or ideas would be greatly appreciated.

        <updated>2022-11-06T00:29:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[这个带有脚本的快速指南有助于清理旧的 Snap 版本并释放 Ubuntu 系统中的一些磁盘空间。


我正在使用的 Ubuntu 测试系统中的磁盘空间不足。因此，我通过 GNOME 的磁盘使用分析器进行调查，以找出哪个包正在消耗宝贵的 SSD 空间。除了通常的缓存和主目录，令我惊讶的是，我发现 Snap 和 Flatpak 消耗了大量的存储空间。



尽管如此，我始终坚持一个规则：除非必要，否则不要使用 Snap 或 Flatpak。这主要是因为它们的安装尺寸和其他问题。我更喜欢原生 deb 和 rpm 包。多年来，我在这个测试系统中安装和移除了一定数量的 Snap 包。

但卸载后还有问题。Snap 在系统中保留了一些残留文件，一般用户不知道。

所以我打开了 Snap 文件夹 /var/lib/snapd/snaps，发现 Snap 保留了以前安装/卸载的软件包的旧版本。

例如，在下图中，你可以看到 GNOME 3.28、3.34 和 Wine 都被删除了。但它们还在那里。发生这种情况是因为 Snap 的设计，它在正确卸载后保留已卸载软件包的版本。



或者，你可以在终端中使用：

snap list --all




对于保留的版本，默认值为 3。这意味着 Snap 会保留每个软件包的三个旧版本，包括活动版本。如果你对磁盘空间没有限制，这是可以的。

但是对于服务器和其他情况，这很容易遇到成本问题，它会消耗你的磁盘空间。

但是，你可以使用以下命令轻松修改计数。该值可以在 2 到 20 之间。

sudo snap set system refresh.retain=2


清理 Snap 版本

在 SuperUser 的一篇文章中，Canonical 的前工程经理 Popey 提供了一个简单的脚本，它可以清理旧版本的 Snaps 并保留最新版本。

这是我们将用来清理 Snap 的脚本。

#!/bin/bash
#Removes old revisions of snaps
#CLOSE ALL SNAPS BEFORE RUNNING THIS
set -eu
LANG=en_US.UTF-8 snap list --all | awk '/disabled/{print $1, $3}' |
while read snapname revision; do
    snap remove "$snapname" --revision="$revision"
done


将上面的脚本以 .sh 扩展名保存在一个目录中（例如 clean_snap.sh），赋予它可执行权限并运行。

chmod +x clean_snap.sh


当我运行脚本后，它减少了很多磁盘空间。该脚本还将显示要删除的包的名称。





结束语

对于 Snap 的设计效率如何，人们总是争论不休。许多人说，它的设计是坏的，是臃肿的，是消耗系统资源的。这种说法的某些部分是真实的，我不会否认它。如果实施和加强得当，整个沙盒应用的概念是很好的。但我相信，与 Snap 相比，Flatpak 工作做得更好。

也就是说，我希望这可以帮助你清理一些磁盘空间。尽管它只在 Ubuntu 中进行了测试，但它应该适用于所有支持 Snap 的 Linux 发行版。

此外，请查看我们关于 如何清理 Ubuntu 的指南以及其他步骤。

最后，如果你要清理 Flatpak 应用，请参阅 这篇指南。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Back in 2003, there was a Brazilian distro called Kurumin, made by Carlos Eduardo Morimoto, which was a LiveCD based on Knoppix.
 It was incredibly famous and many people here had their first experience with Linux with this distro.
 In 2004, another project was started with the idea of expanding Kurumin... Big Linux.
 The then-new project was and still is, lead by Bruno Gonçalves, known as Big Bruno.
 In fact, in the very beginning, Big Linux was just a remastered Kurumin with more preinstalled stuff.
 Kurumin has been defunct since 2008. 
 But Big Linux remains active, has been, for 18 years. Although the project went dormant and almost got discontinued several times.
 It was based on Debian until 2021, when it was rebased to Manjaro (and by extension, to Arch Linux).
 Which means it's now a full blown rolling-release distro which packs the latest and greatest versions of almost all packages, including Linux 6.0.6 kernel and KDE Plasma 5.26.2 
 It has its own artwork, in-house built tools, and a few custom desktop layouts to choose from. And of course has a ton of preinstalled software (living up to its name)!
 The system is, as expected, due to its Manjaro base, very stable and fluid!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am working full remote right now(programming/gamedev) and I travel several times a year for periods of up to two months. Because of specifics of my job I need to have a powerful workstation(I mostly need a powerful CPU) and I am comfortable with at least two 27" monitors. Traveling with that much stuff is only possible with a car, and even then the whole setup takes too much space.
Laptops are getting there with the compute power, but the 27" monitors aren't getting any smaller. Meta Quest Pro(which seems to be the top of the line now) has been just released and even tho it is somewhat pricey($1500), it still costs as much as three good 27" monitors.
Does anyone have any useful experience to share on working in a VR headset? Is it comfortable for longer periods of time? How is it on the eyes?

 The service has both a web app and mobile apps (Android and iOS) and does not even require registration! This is a breath of fresh air because other apps like this will require an app to be downloaded on your phone, a registration and possibly a paid upgrade if you don't want ads.
 Decided to share it here because the developers doubt the significance of this app.
 There is a demo instance available for everyone to fiddle with - try it, no more guessing how much money you owe to whom on a group trip.

一位工程师用两台不带显示器的 Commodore 64 “古代”电脑作为键盘，用五寸软盘粘在一起作为风箱，制作了一台可以演奏的手风琴。这个项目采用了大量定制的软件和硬件黑科技。通过测量风箱挤压时通过的空气噪音并转换为信号。Commodore 电脑本身没有音频设备，音频信号是通过插孔输出发声的。Commodore 64 是有史以来最畅销的电脑，于 1982 年开始生产。

Web 之父说 Web3 根本不是互联网

发明 Web 的蒂姆·伯纳斯-李在里斯本周五举行的 Web 峰会上表示，“真正的 Web3 的名字被以太坊的人拿去做区块链的东西，这真是一个耻辱。事实上，Web3 根本就不是 Web。”Web3 是科技界的一个模糊的术语，用来描述一个假设的未来版本的互联网，它比今天更去中心化，而不被各大巨头所支配。他认为需要澄清 Web 3 和 Web 3.0，并开发了自己的 Web 3.0 项目 Solid。

老王点评：名词并不重要，重要的真正有用，依我看，Solid 也是空中楼阁，未必比以太坊等 Web 3 项目有希望。

但是，在 Ventoy 出道之前，WoeUSB 是用于创建可启动 Windows USB 的首选工具。原版 WoeUSB 工程在 2014 年左右香消玉损。

鉴于其流行程度，一位新的开发者接过了将其起死回生的任务。因此，WoeUSB-ng 诞生了。在这里，“ng” 是 新生代new generation 的缩写。换句话说，WoeUSB-ng 是新生代的 WoeUSB 。但是，因为原版的工具已经不存在了，我将 WoeUSB-ng 描述为 WoeUSB 。

在这篇教程中，我将向你展示如何在 Ubuntu Linux 上安装 WoeUSB 。我也将分享使用 WoeUSB 来创建可启动 Windows USB 的步骤。

但是，在此之前，让我们快速查看这个令人惊叹的工具的特色。

WoeUSB



WoeUSB 是一个简单的工具，其唯一的目的是 在 Linux 上创建可启动 Windows USB 。

原版 WoeUSB 是一个 shell 脚本。这个原版 WoeUSB 被使用 Python 重写为 WoeUSB-ng ，它可以安装在你的系统上，并且通过命令行或 GUI 界面。

特色：


支持老式 PC 启动或 UEFI 启动

支持 FAT32 和 NTFS 文件系统

支持使用物理安装盘或磁盘镜像作为源

它可以用于 Windows Vista 及其更高版本的任意语言或变体版本

老式的 MBR/IBM PC 兼容启动模式

本机 UEFI 启动支持 Windows 7 及其更高版本的镜像（仅限于将 FAT 文件系统作为目标的情况）


在 Ubuntu 和其它的 Linux 发行版上安装 WoeUSB

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[据福布斯网站11月4日报道，社交媒体公司推特3日晚在加州联邦法院遭到集体诉讼，被控违反联邦和州劳工法，未能在4日计划大规模裁员之前向其员工通知到位。据悉，推特计划裁员一半。


据英国天空新闻网报道，埃隆·马斯克当地时间11月4日在推特发文回应推特公司裁员一事，马斯克在推特中写道：“关于推特公司裁员，不幸的是，当公司每天亏损超过400万美元时，这别无选择。每个离开的人都得到了3个月的遣散费，这比法律要求的高出50%。”


美国亿万富翁埃隆·马斯克近期完成了对推特的收购交易，此前有媒体曝光，他计划裁员50%。综合英国路透社、美国全国广播公司（NBC）最新报道，推特公司当地时间3日晚间向员工发布电子邮件通告，公司方将从4日早上开始通过电子邮件方式告知员工是否被裁员。


推特发送裁员通知，员工“一片混乱”


全球首富、特斯拉CEO埃隆·马斯克近期完成了对推特的收购交易。有媒体曝光，他计划裁员50%。综合英国路透社、美国全国广播公司（NBC）最新报道，推特公司当地时间3日晚间向员工发布电子邮件通告，公司方将从4日早上开始通过电子邮件方式告知员工是否被裁员。


据环球网援引NBC报道，推特通告称，“我们认识到这将影响到一些为推特做出了宝贵贡献的人，但不幸的是，为确保公司成功发展，这一（裁员）行动是有必要的。”


报道还称，一名推特员工透露，11月3日的这封电子邮件是在马斯克于当地时间10月27日收购推特后，推特工作人员首次收到来自公司的联系。关于这封邮件的影响，这名员工还说："完全是一片混乱，一屋子（人）都崩溃了，所有人都在盯着这封邮件。”


推特公司还表示，该公司的办公室将被暂时关闭，暂停任何门禁卡等证件的访问权限，以“帮助确保每名员工以及推特系统和客户数据的安全”。


值得注意的是，推特员工当地时间3日在美国旧金山联邦法院提起集体诉讼，指控推特在没有给予足够通知的情况下启动大规模裁员，违反联邦和加州法律。


在马斯克完成收购后，他对推特的改造计划受到关注，多家外媒报道称，他计划裁员50%。新加坡《联合早报》称，早些时候有消息称推特被收购后将裁员75%，但马斯克对此予以否认。不过，葛伯川崎财富和投资管理公司首席执行官戈贝尔说，管理马斯克资产的家族办公室负责人伯查尔告诉他，推特即将进行裁员，“预计大约有50%的人会被解雇”。


《华盛顿邮报》称，据知情人士透露，推特员工总数超过7000人，马斯克团队正在决定第一轮裁员计划，目标是裁掉约1/4的员工。


美国多家大型科技公司宣布裁员


宣布裁员的远不止推特一家公司，受通货膨胀加剧和经济形势恶化的影响，美国多家大型科技公司当地时间3日宣布裁员或暂停招聘。


据中新社消息，总部位于美国旧金山的在线支付公司Stripe首席执行官帕特里克·科里森3日在给员工的备忘录中说，公司将裁员14%。根据该备忘录，Stripe将把员工人数减少至约7000人，这意味着本轮裁员将影响约1100人。


科里森说，在通货膨胀加剧、经济衰退、利率上升、能源危机、投资预算紧缩和创业资金短缺的影响之下，裁员是必要的。


出行共享公司Lyft当日也宣布了裁员计划。在发给员工的备忘录中，Lyft首席执行官洛根·格林和总裁约翰·齐默表示，公司将裁员13%，所有部门都将受到影响。Lyft有5000多名员工，公司在3日提交的一份文件中确认了“解雇约683名员工”的计划。


美国有线电视新闻网报道称，亚马逊3日表示，受经济环境影响，公司计划暂停招聘数月。另外，谷歌母公司“字母表”、脸书母公司元宇宙平台等大型科技公司也纷纷加大了成本控制的力度。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[以下是快速检查在运行 Xorg 还是 Wayland 显示服务器的方法。


随着时间的推移，现代 Wayland 显示服务器正在进入所有 Linux 发行版。尽管老旧的 Xorg 仍然能用并且会继续存在，但 Wayland 无疑在安全性和其他性能方面更好。

但是，Xorg 不会很快完全淘汰。可能永远不会。

如果你在运行任何 Linux 发行版，如何检查运行的是 Xorg 还是 Wayland？下面是方法。

Wayland 或 Xorg：你在运行哪一个？

在你的 Linux 发行版（例如 Ubuntu、Fedora、Arch 等）中打开一个终端窗口（CTRL+ALT+T）。

然后输入以下命令并回车：

echo $XDG_SESSION_TYPE


命令输出会告诉你当前会话是 Wayland 还是 Xorg（X11）。

[debugpoint@fedora ~]$ echo $XDG_SESSION_TYPEwayland




这很简单。但是，还有其他方法。

其他方法

使用设置

如果你需要图形方法，请打开你的 Linux 发行版的设置应用。在关于部分，你应该看到某个标签下中的 Wayland/X11。

例如，在 GNOME 设置中，你可以在 “窗口子系统Windowing system” 下找到它，如下图所示：



使用会话值

你还可以使用 systemd 登录管理器 loginctl 找到它。请记住，它仅适用于基于 systemd 的系统。

打开终端并运行以下命令。你可以看到会话 id 值。在此示例中为 c2：

loginctl


现在，将会话 ID 传递给以下命令以获取显示服务器类型。确保将 c2 更改为你的系统规格。

loginctl show-session c2 -p Type




总结

这些是你可以确定在 Linux 系统中运行的是 Systemd 还是 Xorg 的一些方法。你还可以在 shell 脚本中使用上述命令来实现进一步的流程自动化。

祝好。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[我向所有的 Linux 初学者推荐以下这些命令。




在使用 Linux 命令行时，很容易就会迷失方向，这可能会导致灾难性的后果：我有一次使用删除命令 rm 删除文件，然而删除之后我才意识到我刚刚是删除了计算机的引导目录。后来，我学会了使用 pwd 命令，来知道当前在文件系统的哪个目录下；并且我使用了 trashy 和 trash-cli 这一命令行回收站工具（LCTT 译注：在删除文件时 trash-cli 会充当中间人，将文件先“删除”到桌面上的垃圾箱中，能够通过垃圾箱或通过终端的 trash 命令，来恢复垃圾箱中已删除的文件。）

当我刚开始使用 Linux 时，我有一个放在桌子上的“速查表”，它就是《101 条你应该知道的 Linux 命令》，我在管理 Linux 服务器时能参考速查表上面的这些命令。随着我越来越熟悉这些命令，我越来越精通服务器管理了。

以下是我认为最有用的 12 个 Linux 命令。

1、打印工作目录（pwd）

pwd 命令会打印出你的工作目录。换句话来说，它输出你当前所在目录的路径。pwd 命令有两种选项：-L 或 --logical（即逻辑路径）用来打印当前的目录路径（不解析符号链接），-P 或 --physial（即物理路径）会打印出解析符号链接后的物理目录。（LCTT 译注：你可以进一步阅读我们翻译的 另一篇文章。）

2、创建目录（mkdir）

使用 mkdir 命令来创建一个新目录，是非常容易的。以下命令，创建了一个名为 example 目录（若 example 已存在，则无法创建）：

$ mkdir example


你也可以在嵌套地创建目录及其子目录：

$ mkdir -p example/one/two


如果目录 example 和目录 one 都已存在，则仅会创建目录 two…]]></summary>

 I'm currently a beginner web developer. I haven't been on this career path for very long but do have a degree in software engineering so I know some basic stuff. A friend contacted me saying that he wants me to work/start as a devops in his company. He says he has an instructor that will guide and train me for the role. The work will be remote and the work is contact based, like projects and stuff. I'm not worried about the pay since this is an opportunity for me to get some work experience. So, I want to be prepared before the project starts as I have approximately 2 months. 
 Can you guys recommend a course that teaches me the basics of DevOps? I mean the technical side? I have searched around and found this course https://zerotomastery.io/courses/devops-bootcamp/ Will this be helpful to me? 
 Also, do you this will count as work experience? I mean if the project lasts 3 - 4 months?
 Thank you.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Around 10 months ago i made a post, saying how much the gnu/linux desktop experience had improved that year alone and here i am, doing it again. Think of it as a huge "thank you" to the developers of FOSS projects who made all this improvement possible.
 But seriously, looking even 10 months back, the linux desktop looked and felt completely differently. A lot of stuff has improved since then, plasma 5.24, 5.25 and now 5.26 have been huge updates to overall stability and responsiveness of the desktop and so have gnome versions 41, 42 and now 43. It's to a point where I can confidently say that the major linux desktops are on par with or even more polished than windows and MacOS. 
 Further more, linux gaming (on AMD at least) is to a point where i ask anyone with an AMD graphics card that they only use for gaming and uses windows... why? So many gaming enhancement tools have become prevalent to aid linux gaming in not only matching windows but in some ways even beating it . From the heroic games launcher, GE-Proton, xanmod kernel, GE kernel to mangohud and vkbasalt. All these tools are basically "linux exclusive" and some of them (GE-Proton and vkbasalt) even provide functionality that you cannot easily get on windows (having FSR upscaling on any game of my choosing can be a savior for low end systems or for older games that don't support native 1080p). All of these tools, combined with the general improvements to steam mean that for 99% of games on linux, the experience is: click install, wait, play. (excluding the like 3 games like Destiny 2 or Valorant that don't run)
 And let's not forget about the general performance improvements with every mesa driver, proton/wine or even linux kernel update (6.0 personally gave me a nice ~5% bump).
 And once again, thank you to all the developers and contributors who made all this possible!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[2022年11月3日，提供了超过1100万本书的大型数字图书馆Z-Library的域名被美国邮政检查局查封，其DNS服务器也被没收，该网站提供了超过1100万本书和8400万篇文章，这吸引了稳定的用户群和数百万月度访问者。他们是否会以新域名重新上线，或者逐渐消失，还有待观察。


Z-Library上的书籍主要来自各个出版商，很多都是各种畅销书，格式有epub和kindle格式等等，书籍都没有DRM加密，可以下载到任何电子阅读器或平板电脑上。


普通用户每天可以下载10本书，如果需要每天下载更多书籍，需要每月缴纳几美元的订阅费。不过，Z-Library的使命一直是非商业性的，旨在为所有人提供无限制的免费访问。


据维基百科上的介绍，Z-Library（简称z-lib，前身为BookFinder）是一个电子图书馆和文件分享计划，用户可在此网站上下载期刊文章以及各种类型的书籍。根据Z-Library的说法，截至2022年6月12日，其共收录了10,456,034本书和84,837,646篇文章。Z-Library在其电子书搜索页面上宣称自己是“全球最大的数字图书馆”，并在文章搜索页面上称自身是“全球最大的科学文章存储库”。项目页面的页脚写有“自2009年起提供免费电子书”的字句。Z-Library跟Sci-Hub和创世纪图书馆一样，同是相对较著名的影子图书馆，出版商和政府组织在处理反盗版事宜时，通常会把这三个项目归类为同一类。]]></summary>

Not talking about theming, I'm talking about a full-on wrapper that would mesh with both propietary and open-source applications AND make them effectively act as GTK4 apps with full Wayland support.
 Again, don't flame me if this isn't possible, just explain why it isn't.

What ldd basically does is setting different environment variables that instruct the dynamic/linker loader to (“man ld.so” — https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man8/ld.so.8.html) to print out the loaded shared object by the executed application (as you can see in the screenshot below).
 The environment variables which are used by “ldd” are: LD_TRACE_LOADED_OBJECTS, LD_WARN, LD_BIND_NOW, LD_VERBOSE and LD_DEBUG. We are going to go over all of those variables (which is also detailed in “man ld.so”).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[用这个方便的捕鼠器比喻来理解编译代码。


源代码必须要经过编译才能够运行程序，而对于开源软件，每个人都可以获取源代码。无论你是自己编写了代码，想要编译和运行它，还是下载了某人的项目来尝试它，了解如何通过 编译器 处理源代码，以及编译器如何处理这些代码，这都很有用。

创建一个更好的捕鼠器

一般情况我们不会将一个捕鼠器比作电脑，但不管你信不信，它确实与你正在使用的设备（手机或电脑）的 CPU 有一些相似之处。经典的捕鼠器（我说的不是 🐈）有两种状态：打开或者释放。你可以认为 打开 是将捕鼠器设置好准备捕获老鼠，以及 释放 是捕鼠器被老鼠触发。某种意义上来说，捕鼠器就像是一台有鼠标的电脑。你可以想象一下这个代码，用一种虚构的语言来描述这个过程：

if mousetrap == 0 then
  There's a mouse!
else
  There's no mouse yet.
end


换句话说，你可以基于捕鼠器的状态发现是否有老鼠（数据）。当然，捕鼠器不是万无一失的，有可能有一只老鼠在捕鼠器旁边，由于老鼠还没有触发捕鼠器，所以它的状态还是 打开 的。因此该程序可以进行改进，这都是非常典型的。

开关

总的来说，捕鼠器就是一个开关。你会在家里使用开关打开灯。可以从开关中获得许多信息。比如，人们会从你家灯的状态了解到你是否在家。

你可以根据邻居家灯的状态来改变行为。如果邻居家所有的灯都熄灭了，那么请关掉你大声的音乐，因为人们可能已经上床睡觉了。

CPU 也使用这样的逻辑，只不过乘以几个数量级，缩小到了微观级别。当 CPU 在特定寄存器上接收到电信号时，可以触发其他一些寄存器，然后触发另一个，以此类推。如果这些寄存器有特定的意义，那么就可以通信。也许激活同一主板上某处的芯片，或者使 LED 亮起，或者改变屏幕上的像素颜色。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Linux Lite 6.2 是一个理想的升级，带来一些有用的变化，没什么太花哨的东西。




Linux Lite 是一种流行的轻量级的类 Windows 发行版，为用户提供了一个熟悉的操作系统感受。

最新版本 Linux Lite 6.2 基于 Ubuntu 22.04 LTS，对 UI 进行了各种更改以及各种错误的修复。

Linux Lite 6.2：有什么新功能？



此版本的 Linux Lite 侧重于用户界面调整和错误修复，并对一些应用程序进行了更改。

一些主要亮点包括：


更新的图标

新壁纸

Shotcut 视频编辑器

删除微软 Teams

LibreOffice 7.3.6.2

Linux 内核 5.15


Shotcut 取代 OpenShot



是的，Shotcut 现在取代了 OpenShot，成为 Linux Lite 6.2 上的默认视频编辑器。

OpenShot 之所以被删除，是因为它不能很好地与 Ubuntu 22.04 配合使用，而如果没有一个好用的视频编辑器，用户将不得不自己寻找一个。

Shotcut 无疑是一款出色的视频编辑器。所以，应该是一个不错的选择。

微软 Teams 已删除

另一个重大变化是微软 Teams 不再包含在发行版中。

其原因是微软停止了 Linux 应用程序，转而支持一个渐进式 Web 应用程序版本。

我们之前的报道可以让你更深入地了解：


微软决定放弃 Teams 的 Linux 应用，代之以渐进式Web应用


更新的图标和新壁纸



Linux Lite 6.2 具有最新的 Papirus 图标集以及一系列新的 Linux Lite 主题壁纸。

这应该会给发行版带来用户可能喜欢的焕然一新的外观。

🛠️ 其他更改和改进



其他值得注意的变化包括：


任务管理器的更新

改进了 Lite 升级应用程序中的结束对话。

各种应用程序的最新更新、错误修复等。


你可以阅读完整的发行说明以 了解更多信息。

Linux Lite 6.2 看起来是对以前版本的令人满意的升级，有许多重大的变化和补充。

📥 下载 Linux Lite 6.2

你可以从其官方网站下载最新的 ISO 或使用 Lite 升级工具升级到它。


Linux Lite 6.2


💬 你如何看待 Linux Lite 6.2？愿意试一试吗？

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Somewhat pissed, a tiny bit laughing. I don't usually post, just lurk. After going through all that, I just want to vent a bit. I suggest you read this before going in. This is my personal addition of several issues that I had, which made me almost quit Windows, even though I couldn't.
 I saw the top post somewhat earlier today. Didn't think much of it. I knew that I had a Windows 10 installation due for later this day. Whatever. I've installed Linux. Windows is usually pre-installed so I've never dealt with the process fully.
 It wasn't pleasant. Cortana exists as a veil to what lies underneath. The installation process took 15 minutes or so. Then, after all that, to my sense of humor's delight in anti-climactic irony, it boots into Recovery Mode with error code 0x000000e. After tinkering with boot options I was able to boot from the USB and wiped the drive.
 Now it just goes into diagnostics mode. Great. More work.
 -
 I'm tired of Microsoft's mess. Can't we just have a peaceful install process? Can Windows Update work fine without any issues? I wanted to add my thoughts as too many straws have been broken. Unfortunately, as I work in drafting, almost every CAD software is only available for Windows. Linux was a breeze for most of the time I've used it. If I mess up, I know or understand why and I'm able to backtrack, at least on certain distributions. Whenever Windows fails, it just seems like a brick-wall unless I talk to someone whose entire IT repertoire is diagnosing Windows.

But after a recent re-install of the system I took a moment to take a break until I finish my post-install shell script, which I'm planning to extend with facilities that would enable me to add custom search engines to the browser, testing the default Firefox for this purpose.
 But you can imagine my surprise when I could NOT find such a built-in option in Firefox other than adding them via extensions. But come on guys, it's been a widely known and I assume a popular option in V8-based browsers for ages, I don't even remember when they introduced this functionality so long ago it was. After all, a regular user like me may not find the search engine extensions published on Mozilla web-store satisfactory or even there at all...
 I was thinking about sticking with Firefox after re-install. But now I have to reconsider this option, alas...
 REALLY REALLY SURPRISED! Or, am I so blind not to see the obvious?! Please correct me if I'm wrong.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Version
1.65.0 of the Rust language has been released.  Improvements include
generic associated types, a new let...else statement, and the
ability to break from labeled blocks:


	Plain block expressions can now be labeled as a break
	target, terminating that block early. This may sound a little like
	a goto statement, but it's not an arbitrary jump, only
	from within a block to its end. This was already possible with
	loop blocks, and you may have seen people write loops that
	always execute only once, just to get a labeled break.]]></summary>

For people who like to plan their time, it is tough to be realistic about what work you can get done without a calendar showing you how much time you can invest in your tasks. But it is hard to organize this because there is so much context-switching due to tasks coming from different apps—not to mention "unstructured" sources like email, notes taken during a meeting, a message on Slack, etc..
I’m that type of user—for me, my calendar has always been the ‘primary source of truth’. But the user experience was terrible. I had to keep to-do lists on the side of another app and manually turn my tasks into…]]></summary>

        <updated>2022-11-03T14:22:04.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[近日，赛迪顾问软件与信息服务业研究中心通过广泛调研，编制完成了《中国服务器操作系统市场研究报告（2022H1）》（以下简称“报告”）。报告从市场规模、市场结构和市场特点三方面对 2022 年上半年中国服务器操作系统市场发展情况进行了分析，并从国内产业生态的角度切入，深入分析了现阶段 openEuler 生态的发展情况。当前，以 openEuler 为代表的中国开源社区正在构建以自主技术为核心的产业生态，国产服务器操作系统已经具备产品有开发者社区、有知识产权，高安全、高可用、可定制、可重构的特性。

此前，在工业和信息化部举行的“新时代工业和信息化发展”系列主题新闻发布会上，信息技术发展司相关负责人在答记者问时，表示：“支持成立国内首家开源基金会——开放原子开源基金会，加速孵化开放鸿蒙、欧拉等一批开源项目，推动开源代码托管平台发展，优化壮大开源社区，如欧拉开源社区用户数量超 60 万人，合作单位超 380 家。在服务器操作系统方面，推动服务器操作系统与主流 CPU、数据库、中间件等软硬件的兼容适配，加快提高产品国际竞争力。如，欧拉操作系统终端部署量超 170 万套。”肯定了当前时期国内操作系统产品和生态取得的成就。

报告选取了政府、运营商、金融、能源四大行业市场逐一分析，并对中国服务器操作系统未来的发展趋势进行了研判。赛迪顾问业务总监高丹在 2022 开放原子全球开源峰会 openEuler 分论坛上对报告内容和数据进行了发布和披露。

报告显示，从整体市场来看，2022 年上半年中国服务器操作系统装机量继续高速增长，较上年同期增长 11.7%，达 195.9 万套。



从 openEuler 生态来看，openEuler 系产品（社区版、商业发行版和企业自用版）市场继续保持高速发展态势，2022 年上半年 openEuler 系产品整体装机量达 67 万套，自欧拉开源社区成立（2019 年 12 月）以来，openEuler 系产品总装机量达 172 万套。可以说，openEuler 的全面开源，引发了中国服务器操作系统发展“质”的变化，推动者整个行业进入加速发展阶段。



同时，伴随产品在市场中的稳定表现，openEuler 系产品市场装机量在 2022 年继续突破，取得了多个领域的增速第一：在政府行业，openEuler 系产品在 2022 年上半年市场占有率达 39.2%，位居第一位；在运营商行业，市场占有率达 57.9%；在金融行业，装机量市场占有率达 28.0%，位居第二；在能源行业，市场份额进一步提升，占有率达 29.6%。

openEuler 还通过开源社区的建设，将芯片厂商、整机厂商、操作系统厂商、应用软件厂商等多类伙伴集合到社区中，社区成员实现共建、共享、共治，全球资源逐渐向社区汇聚，从而推动了整个产业链条的发展。同时，随着数字经济建设的不但推进，openEuler 着力建设数字基础设施的底座，通过不断与云计算、边缘计算等结合，提供对数字场景的支持。截至目前，openEuler 社区伙伴已超 380 家，全国下载量超 50 万，用户数量超 60 万人，PR（拉取请求（Pull Request））合入超 5.5 万。

从兼容性来看，openEuler 已完成与多个硬件厂商的兼容适配，通过了 CPU 架构（x86/ARM）、跨代 CPU、主板（USB/拓扑）、外设等房名的兼容性测试。



2019 年 openEuler 宣布开源，2021 年宣布全新升级，欧拉操作系统可覆盖从 IT、CT 到 OT 数字基础设施全场景，并于 2022 年推出首个数字基础设施全场景长周期版本。当前，大量的生态伙伴已经积极加入到 openEuler 开源社区的建设当中，欧拉真正实现了由企业主导向产业共建。未来，openEuler 社区将持续与全产业链伙伴一起，共建、共享、共治，打造全球首选的数字基础设施开源操作系统。]]></summary>

But are there any 32-bit apps that specifically require the 486 that won't run on a newer 32-bit compatible CPU? For example in the case of Wine or a VM. The kernel is responsible for ultimately executing those 486 instructions right?

Our users are web developers, and a prominent and adjacent pain point for our users is authorization. Developers typically implement two independent solutions for authentication and authorization. Offering AuthN and AuthZ in a single solution is something we’ve been thinking about for the last few years.
Quick primer, authentication is knowing who the user is, and authorization is knowing what the user has access to. A physical analogy: A person enters a building.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[11 月 3 日，2022·云栖大会上，阿里云智能总裁张建锋表示，以云为核心的新型计算体系正在形成，软件研发范式正在发生新的变革，Serverless 是其中最重要的趋势之一，阿里云将坚定推进核心产品全面 Serverless 化，帮助客户更好地实现敏捷创新。

“我们希望让用户做得更少而收获更多，通过 Serverless 化，用云就像用电一样简单。”张建锋表示，Serverless 将让云计算从一种资源真正变成一种能力，未来云将全面 Serverless 化，更加接近“电网”模式，按计算的调用次数付费。



Serverless 让软件研发产生根本性改变 

Serverless 并不是不用服务器，恰恰相反，它将服务器全权托管给了云厂商，根据业务流量大小自动弹性伸缩，开箱即用免去维护成本，按使用量计费。用户无需关心和管理底层IT资源，只要聚焦业务代码，根据实际请求处理业务。

依托于 Serverless 架构，云上研发方式正在发生根本性的改变。从过去的集中式研发、分布式研发，到云上的组装式研发，实现了软件研发的服务化、模块化、可编排、可组装。无论是 2 万用户还是 2000 万用户体量，基于 Serverless 构建的 IT 架构都可以自适应伸缩，峰值秒级自动扩容、峰谷自动缩容。

作为国内首家投入 Serverless 的云厂商，阿里云早在 2017 年就推出首款 Serverless 产品——函数计算，开发者只需编写代码并上传，函数计算就会自动准备好相应的计算资源，大幅简化开发运维过程。

目前，阿里云已经拥有超过 20 款 Serverless 产品，包括函数计算 FC、Serverless 应用引擎 SAE、Serverless 容器服务 ASK、PolarDB 数据库、AnalyticDB 数仓等。其中函数计算日调用次数超过 200 亿次，有效支撑历年双 11 百万 QPS 洪峰，业务年均增速超 300%，整体规模位居国内首位。



初创公司和大型企业都在使用 Serverless

“以前搞大促我们技术团队都睡不着觉，要时刻盯着服务器水位，心里都没谱”，世纪联华是最早试水 Serverless 的新零售代表，联华华商技术负责人楼杰表示，“现在我们不用管理服务器这些基础设施，只要编写代码上传，函数计算就会准备好计算资源，水位远远高于我们储备能力的极限。”世纪联华将会员系统、交易系统、支付系统等迁移到阿里云函数计算上处理，促销准备时间从周级缩短到小时级，研发运维提效 30%，成本下降 40%，真正把促销活动变成常态。

流媒体平台南瓜电影，因为一场热映电影 1 小时内增加了 100 万用户，是当时日常流量的 5 倍以上，流量暴涨引发网站服务一度中断，临时云上扩容也无法及时满足巨大的流量。了解到 Serverless 的优势后，南瓜电影果断将系统直接部署到阿里云  Serverless 应用引擎 SAE 上，不用改造应用代码，直接上传部署 WAR/JAR 包，省去了购买服务器和运维的过程，“云上资源想弹多少弹多少，想什么时候弹就什么时候弹。”峰谷时按需自动缩容，七天内就完成了新架构的升级和部署，总成本下降  40%，运维效率提升 10 倍，从容应对突发流量。

除了广泛应用的小程序外，Serverless 还受到电商大促、音视频转码、AI 算法、游戏分发、物联网等场景的青睐。权威分析机构 Gartner 预测，2025 年将有 50% 以上的全球企业采用 Serverless 架构。]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[11 月 3 日，在 2022 云栖大会上，阿里云智能总裁张建锋发表主题演讲，他认为历经十多年的发展，云计算带来的变革依然被严重低估，它正在重构整个 IT 软硬件和终端世界，形成一个全新的计算体系。新一轮的科技变革正在深入发展，阿里云将坚持技术长征，面向下一代体系去构建第二技术曲线，抓住未来技术的定义权。

张建锋认为，以云计算为核心的新型计算体系，正在带来三大变革：首先，云重构了整个 IT 硬件体系，数据中心、芯片、服务器等产业链发生深刻变化；其次，软件研发范式发生深刻变革，Serverless、低代码、AI 大模型开源等趋势，大幅提升软件生产效率；最后，云和端加速融合，算力从端转移上云，未来万物皆是计算机。



重构整个 IT 硬件体系

张建锋回顾云计算演进历程，过去十多年，云的创新主要集中在软件领域，首先出现了分布式虚拟化，而后实现了资源池化，形成了广泛的应用规模。现在，云计算已经从软件创新，走向软硬件协同创新，用云来定义整个 IT 硬件体系。

今年，阿里云发布了一款云数据中心专用处理器 CIPU，替代 CPU 来管理和加速计算、存储和网络资源。这是一种全新的架构方式，代表着云计算深入到数据中心内部做体系化创新。CIPU 实现了全面专用硬件加速的高性能，包括高带宽、高吞吐和弹性 RDMA 的能力。“飞天+CIPU”的组合性能表现普遍优于业内同类产品，性能可提升 20% 以上。

在此基础上，阿里云基础设施已经广泛基于 CIPU 架构进行建设，并且构建了全栈自研的基础设施，例如自研 CPU 芯片倚天 710、磐久服务器、EIC 高性能网卡、磐久交换机、磐久液冷一体机、磐久液冷集装箱等自研硬件。

去年，阿里巴巴发布了首款“为云而生”的芯片倚天 710。目前，倚天 710 云实例已在多家互联网科技公司大规模应用，算力性价比提升超 30%，单位算力功耗降…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've been using Linux for a few months now, and due to some software I need for college I had to set up dual-booting on my laptop. 
 I never realized just how horribly slow the install process on Windows is. When I first installed Linux Mint, installation was nearly instant, and everything just worked out of the box. With Windows, it's screen after screen of setup. Honestly it's almost less hassle to manually install Arch.
 The thing that really stuck out to me, though, is about halfway through the installation, Windows popped up a screen saying "We're giving you a free trial of Microsoft Office"
 Whatever, I click Ok
 Next screen: "Please confirm your credit card info, you will be charged $99.99 when your free trial ends"
 Really? I haven't even installed the OS yet and you're already trying to scam me out of $100? Not to mention that they already had my credit card info pre-filled out, despite the fact that I don't think I've ever given them permission to store my credit card info
 This was followed by a few screens of ads (still in the installation media) before having to wait several more minutes until it finally installed. I then had to spend several minutes uninstalling all the bloatware that comes with Windows (Or at least what Windows lets me uninstall. Why can't I uninstall the "Your Phone" app?)
 Sorry if this post is a little off topic, but I just wanted to share the moment that made a new-ish Linux user become a lifelong user. I can't see myself ever going back to a full installation of Windows.

distribution that will not be available for 18 months or so, but that
is exactly what was recently posted to the mailing list. 
The change targets the C source code in the myriad of packages that the
distribution ships; it would fix code that uses some ancient compatibility
features that were removed by the C99 standard but are still supported by
GCC.  As might be guessed from the 
long runway proposed, there is quite a bit of work to do to get there.]]></summary>

Statcounter 是一个网站分析服务，在 150 万个网站上安装了跟踪代码，记录每个网站的数十亿次页面浏览。据 Statcounter 最新数据，安卓占全球所有操作系统份额为 42.37%，Windows 30.11%、iOS 17.6%、OS X 6.24%、除了安卓之外的 Linux 1.04%。而就桌面市场而言，Windows 占 75.93%，OS X 15.74%，Linux 2.6%，Chrome OS 2.38%。对于移动市场，安卓占 70.96%，iOS 28.43%。

老王点评：安卓的成功，也是移动操作系统的成功，也是广义上的 Linux 的成功。




英国准备立法废除传真机

传真机由施乐公司在 1964 年商业化，1980 年代起被世界各地的企业广泛使用，如今已被电子邮件、扫描仪、云端传真和即时通讯服务所取代。虽然传真机早已过时，但英国卫生服务机构仍在大量使用它，英国国家医疗服务系统现在还有数百台传真机。英国通信监管机构 Ofcom 表示它准备修订电信规则淘汰传真机。


消息来源：The Register



老王点评：之前利用互联网发送传真都被视作违法，而现今，几乎没有人用传真了。




OpenSSL 3 漏洞补丁释出，危险程度比预想要轻

由于 OpenSSL 3 出现了严重安全漏洞，原计划在 10 月底发布的 Fedora Linux 37 延迟发布。现在，OpenSSL 3 发布了补丁，修复了两个缓冲溢出漏洞。漏洞等级从之前被认为与“心脏流血”漏洞相当的“超危”降为“高危”。这两个漏洞影响所有 OpenSSL 3.x 系列，不过目前主要使用的版本 OpenSSL 1.x 不受影响。


消息来源：Phoronix



老王点评：还好，不过互联网安全需要更可靠安全的 SSL 实现。]]></summary>

 This is, by far, the best premium looking Linux desktop of all time IMHO.
 It IS stable, functional and visually consistent.
 Note: There’s a “Basic” and an “Enhanced” or “Pro” edition. 
 The Basic one looks a bit bland and very different from the Professional edition shown in the video. 
 And yeah both are Free of charge.

 Last weekend I had the time to find a secondary Linux distro for my laptop, I use Fedora as my main distro, and thought that I would share my thoughts about the ups and downs of the distros that I tried. Distros tried: Arch, FreeBSD, Gentoo, openSUSE (Tumbleweed and Leap), NixOS, Debian 11.
 Arch
 So I used Arch on my previous laptop for over a year and was quite excited, the main reason I wasn't using Arch already is because I got a beefier laptop and wanted to try out some commercial distros.
 Pros:
  
arch-install: I liked the new arch-install, I think it's actually a good looking upgrade to the initial script, most things were very intuitive and I think it's slowly opening Arch up to newer audiences
 AUR: The AUR alone is one of the main reason to use Arch, it makes softw…]]></summary>

 ​
 id like to hear what you all like or dislike!
 ​
 Edit: I've received a lot of good information, thank you all. since Opensuse will be discontinuing leap in the near future my plan will be to install Fedora on an older machine and test it out for a couple weeks!

 Probably not much in it but is one superior? I thought the advice was always visudo but seems like sanitizing config state is unnecessary if you wrap it in a adduser command.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[本文介绍我使用 Terraform 五年之后吸取到的经验。




使用 Terraform 五年的经历让我吸取到一些重要经验。无论团队大小、项目性质，有五条要点对于配置合乎逻辑且可用的 Terraform 平台至关重要。

1、了解你的目标受众

这一点似乎显而易见，但我也见过一些在这方面犯错的案例。当组织和规划 Terraform 的相关代码时，无论是将目录结构标准化还是确定命名规范，考虑目标受众是非常重要的。例如：你的团队是否会使用这些 Terraform 脚本和模块？你是否会向其他团队交接工作？你的团队是否会有新成员加入？你是否正在独自进行项目开发？你是否会半年或一年后仍然使用这些配置，还是会将它安排给别人？

这类问题会影响某些决策。理想情况下，无论如何都应该有 远程状态Remote State 和 状态锁定State Locking 两种状态。远程状态确保你的笔记本电脑不是你的 Terraform 唯一运行的机器，状态锁定确保同一时刻只有一个人对基础设施进行修改操作。

命名规范应该对项目的最终拥有者有意义，而不是只对开发团队有意义。如果项目会转交给其他团队，应该确保他们对命名规范有发言权。如果代码由非技术的利益相关者或内部安全/ GCR 团队负责审查，应该确保他们会检查命名规范。另外，对于资源名称，为了让代码审查人员更仔细地进行检查，你应该使用资源标签，把有关的数据分类/隐私需求（高、中、低）标示出来。

2、重用，重用，重用

Terraform 注册表 为大多数普通用例提供了现成模块类库。我已经使用过 VPC 模块和安全模块中的大量功能，这些功能只需要提供相关的参数就能使用。使用不同的参数，简单调用这些模块对于处理大部分用例已经足够了。尽可能多地重用这些公共模块，可以避免大量且重复的编码、测试、检查、修复、重构等操作。

 Love the aesthetic but it felt sluggish - Geekbench confirmed slower than W11 on the same hardware (test ran several times).
 For reference, Ubuntu 22.04 returned 1615 on single core (again same hardware).
 Anyone know why Zorin would have such a performance penalty given it's based on Ubuntu?

 I am pleased to announce my thirteenth ebook Computing from the Command Line. This is the longest book I've published so far (203 pages) and it took me more than 7 months to complete the first version.
 This ebook aims to teach Linux command line tools and Shell Scripting for beginner to intermediate level users. The main focus is towards managing your files and performing text processing tasks. Plenty of examples are provided to make it easier to understand a particular tool and its various features. Exercises at the end of chapters will help you practice what you've learned and solutions are provided for reference.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[这是在 Ubuntu 和其他 Linux 系统中安装 Viber 的快速指南。


Viber 是一个免费、安全的通话和聊天程序，适用于所有流行的移动平台和操作系统。

它具有丰富的功能，例如语音/视频通话、支持 GIF 的文本消息、贴纸、照片和视频。此外，Viber 还具有群聊、群呼和消失消息功能。

Viber 是一个闭源程序，但有免费的 Linux 原生可执行客户端。

下面是安装它的方法。

在 Linux 上安装 Viber

它以 AppImage 可执行文件、deb 和 rpm 包的形式提供。按照下面的相应按钮直接下载。平均可执行文件大小约为 180MB。


下载适用于所有 Linux 发行版的 Appimage



适用于 Ubuntu 的 Deb 可执行文件



Fedora 的 RPM 包


如果你已下载 AppImage，只需从任意文件管理器将权限更改为可执行文件即可。然后运行。

对于 Ubuntu、Linux Mint、Debian 和相关发行版，你可以通过多种方法安装 deb 包。

你可以通过已安装的软件管理器双击打开。或者通过 dpkg 命令安装，如下所示。

sudo dpkg -i viber.deb


对于 Fedora 和基于 RPM 的软件包，你可以通过以下命令安装。

sudo dnf localinstall viber.rpm


对于 Arch Linux 和其他发行版，你可以使用我上面提到的 Appimage。

使用

完成安装 Viber 后，通过应用菜单打开它。以下是你需要记住的几件事。

在从笔记本电脑/台式机开始使用 Viber 之前，你需要在手机上进行设置。从以下链接为你的移动平台下载并安装 Viber。


谷歌应用商店

苹果应用商店


安装后，设置 Viber。请记住，它需要你的手机号码才能注册。

设置完成后，在 Linux 桌面上打开应用。你应该会看到如下页面。



从你的手机应用扫描二维码，你应该可以在 Linux 桌面上使用 Viber。

注意： 由于它是一个闭源应用，请确保你在使用 Viber 时了解此应用的条款和与隐私相关的情况。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[欧盟新法律可能迫使苹果公司开放其核心利益

欧盟新的《数字市场法案》（DMA）于今天生效，进入六个月的实施阶段，将于名年 5 月 2 日开始适用。DMA 将适用于符合其 “看门人” 标准的科技巨头，并迫使他们向其他公司和开发者开放其各种服务和平台。苹果几乎可以肯定被列为“看门人”，因此将受到 DMA 的约束。这可能迫使苹果公司让用户访问第三方应用程序商店，并允许在 iPhone 和 iPad 上进行应用程序侧载，使用第三方支付系统，访问苹果收集的数据，以及提高 iMessage 互操作性等等。


消息来源：Mac Rumors



老王点评：不能不说，欧盟的这些法律极大地制裁了那些垄断巨头。




Mozilla 公布它的 Manifest V3 扩展方案

Manifest V3（MV3）是 Chrome 的新扩展规范，Chrome 将从明年 1 月开始逐步淘汰之前的 MV2 扩展。Mozilla 的 MV3 和谷歌的 MV3 之间有些区别，最重要的是没有采用谷歌的声明式网络请求（DNR），而保留了 MV2 的 WebRequest API。这也是新的扩展系统引发广泛争议的地方，广告屏蔽扩展如 uBlock Origin 使用 WebRequest 在广告下载前屏蔽其请求。


消息来源：Solidot



老王点评：我觉得 Mozilla 这次做的很好。




Meta 宣称其 AI 音频编解码器提供 10 倍于 MP3 的压缩率

上周，Meta 公司宣布了一种名为 “EnCodec” 的人工智能驱动的音频压缩方法，据说可以将音频压缩到比 MP3 格式小 10 倍的 64kbps，而且人耳听不到质量损失。其关键是识别人类无法察觉的变化，他们使用鉴别器来提高生成的样本的感知质量，该模型通过让重建的样本与原始样本在感知上更加相似来生成样本以“欺骗”鉴别器。


消息来源：Ars Technica



老王点评：通过 AI 分析人耳不能识别的部分，从而“骗过”鉴别器，这真是一种巧妙的方法。AI 越来越做到一些人所做不到的地方。]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[11月2日，马斯克在推特上发文称：“推特目前不能让每个人加蓝V的做法太糟糕了，就像阶级制度一样。现在每个人都有权利加蓝V了，每个月8美元。”


据悉，推特过去是根据认证通过的个人资料才会给用户“加蓝V”，但这个过程不会收费。而本次马斯克突然一改推特以前的做法，有媒体称是因为马斯克在研究推特“加蓝V”的机制后提出的。


在最近的一项民意调查中，超过80%的推特用户表示他们不会为“加蓝V”付费，其次是10%的用户表示每月仅愿意支付5美元（约合人民币36元）。


同时，推特原本针对“加蓝V”用户一项可选的附加收费功能Twitter Blue，服务费将从每月4.99美元涨至20美元。据悉，Twitter Blue可自定义导航栏和撤销推文等。

对于这一做法，畅销书作家斯蒂芬·金在推特上写道：“如果这样做，我就会离开（推特平台）。”


早先，在经历了半年的拉锯后，马斯克终于以440亿美元完成对推特的收购，从而获得对该公司的控制权。根据纽约证券交易所的退市通知，10月28日，推特从纽交所退市。接管后，马斯克迅速“血洗”管理层，解雇了包括原推特CEO、CFO在内的多名高管，由马斯克接任该公司唯一董事。


另据报道，马斯克已于上周六下令裁员。推特原有约7500名员工。据《华盛顿邮报》报道，首轮裁员幅度可能达到25%，主要目标是那些近期对代码库没有贡献的中层管理人员和工程师。裁员预计将从本周开始，管理人员已经列出了被裁员的员工名单。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[11月1日，腾讯最大股东、南非Naspers集团荷兰子公司Prosus发布声明称，媒体公司“亚洲科技”（Asian Tech Press）文章称中信集团正组团与Naspers谈判以收购其持有的全部腾讯股份，该文是猜测性的，不符合事实。中信集团也透过媒体表示报道不实。


据证券时报，虽然外资是大股东，但是腾讯一直高度由创始人控制的管理团队运营，是民营企业。如果外资选择卖给中信集团，则意味着国有资本成为大股东，有可能打破现在的经营体制，所以外界高度关心此事。


Naspers集团在声明中称将继续执行今年6月宣布的开放式股票回购计划，该计划的资金来源是定期和有序地出售集团持有的少量腾讯控股的股票。Naspers董事会与Prosus董事会重申对腾讯的长期前景仍有信心，并认为该股份回购计划符合Prosus、Naspers及其各自股东的最佳利益。


Prosus资产净值报表显示，截至10月28日，Prosus仍持有26.926亿股腾讯股票，与港交所披露文件显示的9月9日Prosus持股数量一致，意味着Naspers在9月9日至10月28日的时间内阶段性停止减持腾讯股票的动作。


据中国基金报，中信集团也回应了，11月1日，针对中信组团收购腾讯股份的消息，中信集团相关人士表示：“传闻不实，无相关计划。”


另据第一财经，记者向接近中信投资端人士了解到，目前并不存在所谓“中信组团收购腾讯股票”的事情。多位投资界人士也对记者表达了对该传言的否认。


11月1日中午12:34，腾讯公关总经理张军在朋友圈转了一首歌曲《流言》，并配文称：“流言传来传去，说不停不知道何时能停息。”


Naspers是一家总部位于南非开普敦的大型跨国科技传媒集团，成立于1915年，并于1994年在约翰内斯堡交易所上市，主体业务已经从传媒转型成全球性互联网文娱和投资。2001年，Naspers投资腾讯3200万美元（约合人民币2.3亿元），获得46.5%的股权。


Prosus（AEX：PRX）则是Naspers的子公司，为提升融资能力，Naspers打包所持的腾讯等互联网公司资产，于2019年在荷兰挂牌上市。


此次传言中涉及到的股份，主要是指Prosus所持有的腾讯股份，历史上经过IDG二次出售、腾讯上市、以及2022年南非报业集团大幅频繁减持，Prosus目前持股比例降至9月8日的27.99%。


但需注意的是，腾讯股权采取VIE架构，单一大股东并不具备投票权，仅具备分红权。截至11月1日收盘，腾讯控股股价227.4港元，涨10.6%，创近七日新高。


以腾讯的最新的2.19万亿港元市值计算，目前Naspers所持股份的市值超过6000亿港元（约合人民币5555亿元），如果真有交易，那绝对是中外资本市场交易中罕见的大手笔。


据中国基金报，此前，在10月24日晚间有消息称，中国移动可能入股腾讯。对此，腾讯方面回应称，该消息不实。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Vanilla OS 是建立在 GNOME 上的、具有按需不变性和软件包选择自由的 Ubuntu。听起来很有趣？在这里阅读更多信息。




这正是我第一次接触 Vanilla OS 时的想法。

当 Bottles 的创建者 Mirko Brombin 在 Twitter 上宣布它时，让我对它产生了兴趣 😎。

我加入了他们的 Discord 频道并成为了一名测试者。虽然我没有做出什么贡献，但关注项目发展是很有趣的。

回到至关重要的问题上：什么是 Vanilla OS？

Vanilla OS 的目标是提供一个干净、原味的 GNOME 体验，并具有按需不变性的能力。

听起来很有趣？让我告诉你我试了试它的第一个开放测试版本后的一些细节。


💡 Vanilla OS 计划在 11 月有一个稳定的版本。

它将跟随 Ubuntu 的小版本发布。

因此，你可以期待每年发布两个版本。例如，你可以从 Ubuntu 22.04 升级到 Ubuntu 22.10 甚至更之后的版本。

除非你知道自己在做什么，否则你不应该把它作为日常系统来使用。


Vanilla OS：又一个基于 Ubuntu 的发行版？



是，也不是。

对于初学者来说，我认为有以下独特的理由可以尝试一下：


在 Ubuntu 之上获得 原装 GNOME 体验。（Fedora 也是一个很好的选择，但并不适合所有人！）

在其安装后的首次设置时，允许你选择并启用 Flatpak/Snap/AppImage。

按需不变性，意味着你可以使系统变成只读，以防止来自第三方应用程序和更新的关键变化。

一个新的软件包管理器（apx）允许你默认在管理的容器内安装软件包。


首次设置过程的体验很轻松。


ℹ️ 目前，它使用 Calamares 安装程序。他们打算用 Crystal Linux 中使用的 Jade 取代它。




越来越多的发行版投身于此；我相信更多的用户会乐意加入到 Linux 中来。



Vanilla OS 对软件包管理器的选择

当然，像 Ubuntu MATE 和 Pop!_OS 这样的发行版已经付出了巨大的努力，而 Vanilla OS 也为此增加了一些改进。



这看起来是一种漂亮的体验！😊

一旦你完成了首次设置，你就没有什么可担心的了。你会得到通常的 GNOME 桌面，以及由 Patrik Kramolis 制作的漂亮的壁纸。



接下来，我试着检查了按需不变性，你可以用以下命令查看和调整：



你可以在 GitHub 上了解更多这个（基本上）使之成为可能的工具。

接下来，看看新的软件包管理器，我喜欢 Distrobox 的底层概念，使其与 apx 成为可能。

Distrobox 的创建者 Luca di Maio 也参与了 Vanilla OS 的开发。

不过，当用 apx 安装一个软件包时，你需要用命令来初始化容器：

apx init


如果它能自动完成，那就更直观了。



当然，我不知道技术上的限制。但是，对于用户端来说会感觉更顺滑！

总的来说，一个利用容器安装应用程序的软件包管理器、获得选择你的软件包管理器的能力、按需不变性，以及原味的 GNOME 使它看起来是一个值得关注的好东西。

前面的路：第一印象

我觉得，一旦它进入稳定版，它就会成为我的日常使用系统。

原因是：我总是喜欢原装的 GNOME 体验，而且不需要处理 Fedora 的定期升级。

当然，等我使用了稳定版之后，我可以给你写一篇整体的用户体验评判。

在那之前，我想说这是一个我相信很多用户都会喜欢的项目 👏。

目前，你可以通过加入其 Discord 频道来下载 ISO。该 ISO 还没有公开向所有人提供。如果你感兴趣，可以看看它的 文档。


Vanilla OS


然而，按照路线图，他们计划很快就会有一个候选版本。

Tier is "Terraform for Stripe" but it goes further and gives you feature flag style access checks, and allows you to count/report usage which can be used for metered billing.
When we started Tier, we knew that there was something interesting in the SaaS pricing and packaging space. Adjusting price is the single most effective lever a business can use to achieve product/market fit, and there's a strong correlation price nimbleness and market success.
In spite of overwhelming evidence of this, most startups pick the price for their product once and then never change it, opting instead to invest in less effective levers like CAC, sales efficiency, "virality", churn, etc. Why?

This means from your laptop, you can easily find that complex bash pipeline you wrote on your server, and see the context in which you ran it.

 Specifically:
  
Login, and choose something to watch.
 I get a grey-ish screen. Sometimes a spinner flashes up for a moment, and then disappears. The content never loads.
 In the dev console, there are several 403s coming from the CDN.
  
Support desk sounds as though this is the first they've heard of it. Is anyone else having this issue?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm developing Hyperstep[0], a spatial language for music production. I find using existing DAWs frustrating because they don't allow me to navigate and operate intuitively on the latent spaces behind my musical ideas. This is why I've decided to build my own set of "seeing tools".(Bret Victor)[1]. I'm also convinced that by framing music as processes and interactions in the 3D world, spatialization and mixing should become fairly pain-free.
I'm still early in development and I would love to build this into an actual product that can be integrated into existing DAWs or even turn it into a musical framework itself for AR and VR experiences.
If you're interested in working on it or if you simply want to know more, feel free to contact me.

It was tough: I didn't know anything about WebAssembly internals and I'm a newbie with Go... so I tried to document it as much as I could for anyone that would like to approach the quest in the future!
It misses a lot of features (that will be gradually implemented).
Any feedback is welcomed!!

There has been a lot of controversy and hype around NFTs, but we’re focused on solving the technical challenges that our customers (software developers working with digital assets) deal with on a day-to-day basis.

security problems, is available.  The release
notes list two vulnerabilities (CVE-2022-3786 and CVE-2022-3602) that

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you want to know about a certain distro, you go on YouTube to look up some review, and over 90% of the videos you're gonna find are some guy spending like 20 minutes just poking around a freshly-installed system, in some cases not even on the real hardware (as in in Virtual Box). The videos are usually barely edited at all, and the person making it constantly makes mistakes in their claims (e.g. out of all the Feren OS videos I've watched, almost every single one of them claimed that the software center is Gnome's or Ubuntu's, while in reality it's Mint's).
 These videos are absolutely pointless. You're not gonna figure out what the distro is in the first half an hour. If there are any bugs or other issues, they're most likely gonna come out once you start ACTUALLY using it, like installing a bunch of software, extracting archives, watching videos, maybe even gaming, etc. It's usually always something small that's easy to miss. And yet the "reviewer" at the end of the video will always make some kinda conclusion, call it a great OS or even compare it to some other distro.
 I hate this crap. In the midst of all this, nobody makes any ACTUAL reviews, where a person has used the system on their main machine for at least a couple of weeks. And why should they? When these 'First Look' videos (that are also often labeled 'review' btw) collect thousands of views, while actual reviews often struggle to get noticed. Worst of all, the community keeps encouraging these videos. Many prominent Linux youtubers have built their career doing just that. It's very low-effort content that has little to no informational value.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[这篇速成指南诠释了一些步骤，它对于恢复一个 Arch Linux 安装很有帮助。


作为一个滚动发布版本，Arch Linux 有时会崩溃。那不是你自身的问题，而是因为数百个其它的原因，例如一个新内核与你的硬件或软件的兼容性。但是，即使如此，Arch Linux 仍然是比较优秀的，并且提供最新的软件包和应用程序。

但是，有些时候，它会给你带来麻烦，最后你只会看到一个闪烁的光标。

因此，在这种情况下，在你放弃希望前，你可能希望尝试恢复系统的安装以及数据，而不是重新格式化或重新安装。这篇指南在这些方面概述了一些步骤。

恢复 Arch Linux 安装

第一步是创建一个可启动的 Arch Linux 的现场Live USB 。从下面的链接中下载 ISO 镜像文件，并创建一个可启动的 ISO 的启动盘。你可以查看 这篇 关于如何使用 Etcher 创建可启动的 ISO 的启动盘的指南。记住，这一步骤需要在另一个工作稳定的系统上完成，很明显，这是因为你当前系统是不可用的。


下载 arch linux


你需要知道在 你的 Arch Linux 安装在哪个分区上。这是关键的一步。如果你不知道，你可以使用 GParted 来找出来。或者在你的 Grub 菜单中查看，或者也可以运行下面的命令来找出来。这将列出你所有的磁盘分区、大小和标签。

sudo lsblk -o name,mountpoint,label,size,uuid


在完成后，插入 USB 设备，并从中启动。你应该会在现场 USB 启动后看到 Arch Linux 提示符。

现在，使用下面的命令挂载 Arch Linux 分区。将 /dev/sda3 更改为你实际对应的分区。

mount /dev/sda3 /mnt
arch-chroot /mnt

人们设立了自动监听站，它们甚至可以贴在小如蜜蜂的动物身上。这些数字设备的功能就像一个行星规模的助听器：使人类能够观察和研究大自然的声音，超越我们感官能力的极限。这些数据通过 AI 来处理，找到可能帮助我们理解动物之间的对话的模式，现在已经有了鲸鱼的歌声和蜜蜂的舞蹈等数据库。但这也可能带来一个意想不到的滥用：比如将机器人放入蜂巢，欺骗蜜蜂飞到哪里去寻找特定的蜜源，从而对动物进行剥削性使用。

老王点评：AI 确实能做很多好事，但是，如果被滥用也很可怕。你能想象蜜蜂被不断驱使去采蜜直到累死吗？




旧金山举办人工智能艺术展

旧金山的一个名为“人工想象”新的艺术展览展示了艺术家们利用 DALL-E 2、GPT-3 和其他 AI 系统生成的作品。作品包括一系列的作品，从视频到静态图像和雕塑。艺术家和策展人说，这个展览是第一个此类展览，是对人工智能艺术确实是艺术的一个重要认可。一些参加展览的艺术家将当前的时刻比作伴随着照相机到来的类似的手忙脚乱。

老王点评：确实，就像相机的出现不但没有消灭传统艺术，反而成了一种新的艺术门类。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[在 Windows 上设置你的路径，这样你就可以使用开源的命令。


当你在操作系统上启动应用程序时，操作系统需要使用某些代码库和实用程序来运行该应用程序。你的操作系统知道如何找到这些库和实用程序，因为它有一个 系统路径，这是一个通往许多应用程序需要的共同共享数据的地图。所有操作系统都有这一点，但用户通常不会意识到这一点，因为他们通常不需要在意它。然而，当你需要编程或使用特殊的网络实用程序或命令时，你可能需要关心你自己的 PATH 变量配置。

PATH 变量使你可以将命令保存到一致的位置，并使用命令提示符或更强大（而开源的）Powershell 从系统上的任何位置调用它们。

例如，假设你想安装开源应用程序 pscp.exe，它是 Windows 上著名的 PuTTY OpenSSH 客户端的命令行界面。你可以将它下载到你的硬盘，但是你的命令行如何知道它的存在呢？其实一开始，它并不知道：

PS> pscp
 pscp: 命令 “pscp” 不能被识别为 cmdlet、脚本文件或可操作程序的名称。
 检查名称的拼写，或者如果包含了路径，则检查路径是否正确，然后再试一次。


如果你正在使用一个开源命令行，例如 Powershell 或 Cmder，那么你将得到一个有用的错误提示，提示这可能是你的路径有问题（或缺少路径）。下面是解决这个问题的方法。

设置 PATH

首先，在桌面上创建一个名为 App 的文件夹。

接下来，右键单击屏幕左下角的 Windows 菜单，然后选择 “系统System”。



在弹出的 “系统System” 窗口中，单击窗口左侧的 “高级系统设置Advanced system settings” 链接。

在出现的 “系统属性System properties” 窗口中，单击窗口底部的 “环境变量Environment variables” 按钮。



在 “环境变量Environment variables” 窗口中，单击 “用户变量User variables” 面板下的 “新建New” 按钮。



在弹出的对话框中，为 “变量名Variable name” 字段输入 PATH，为 “变量值Variable value” 字段输入 %USERPROFILE\Desktop\App 。单击 “确定OK” 按钮保存更改。



在 Desktop/Apps 中放置你想从命令提示符中访问的命令和应用程序，Powershell、Cmder 甚至 Cmd 都能找到它们。

PS> pscp –version
 pscp: Release 0.XY
 Build platform: 64-bit x86 Windows
 PS>


自动设置路径

许多应用程序会在安装过程中自动添加到系统路径中。然而，并不是所有的程序都如此，要么是因为你在安装过程中遗漏了一个复选框，要么是因为应用程序开发人员希望你自己添加它。当自动路径失败时，你现在知道如何自己设置路径。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I obviously have some preferences, but that’s just because they require less steps to get to my preferred state.
 I like GNOME with minimal extensions, spend most of my time in the terminal/Text Editor and browser. I run the same chat apps in the background always installed as flatpaks. Steam and proton work on most distros just fine. Lots of services I just replace with Docker/Podman instead, and for everything else, systems is a standard api.
 I don’t care if I have to type apt, zypper, yum, pacman, dnf, etc. I don’t care if the calculator is a snap or a native app. I don’t really even care that the snap daemon is running. I don’t care if there’s an extra line of text in the terminal when I run an apt update
 I’m just using the OS with the workflows that best suit me. None of this other stuff matters at all.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[这里是如何将你当前的 Ubuntu 22.04 LTS Jammy Jellyfish 升级到 Ubuntu 22.10 Kinetic Kudu 的步骤。


始终停留在长期支持的发布版本，这是金科玉律。因为，先前的 Ubuntu 22.04 LTS Jammy Jellyfish 将被支持到 2027 年 4 月。这是一段很长的时间。

此外，LTS 版本超级稳定。它们很少损坏并变得不稳定。因此，如果你在笔记本电脑/台式机电脑或服务器上安装使用 LTS 版本，保持使用它。

然而，如果你想要最新的内核、GNOME 43 和 Pipewire 之类的最新技术 – 你可能会想完成版本跳级，并升级到 Ubuntu 22.10 Kinetic Kudu。

这里是如何做的方法。

升级 Ubuntu 22.04 LTS 到 Ubuntu 22.10

注意：我希望你没有运行去年 10 月份发布的 Ubuntu 21.10 Impish Indri 。因为它已经不被支持。但是鉴于某些原因，你正在运行它，我建议你直接重新安装 22.10 。或者，先升级到 22.04 ，再升级到 22.10 。

在你升级前

在你升级前，做一些内务整理。这是非常重要的。


备份你的 /home、/downloads 和其它的文件到 USB 驱动器或任意独立的分区，以防升级失败。

如果你随着时间的流逝而添加了一些额外的 PPA ，确保将它们记录下来。虽然，在升级过程开始前，升级过程将禁用 PPA 。而在升级完成后，确保手动启用 PPA 。

记录并禁用所有的 GNOME 扩展。如果开发人员没有按照 GNOME 版本进行更新，那么扩展在升级后将会损坏。

家中常备一个现场 USB 磁盘。


升级步骤

打开 “软件包和更新Software & Update” 。

转到 “更新Updates” 标签页。

转到 “通知我新的 Ubuntu 版本Notify me of a new Ubuntu version”，选择并将其更改为 “任意新的版本For any new version”。

这将告诉软件包管理器来查找 Ubuntu 22.10 发布版本的详细信息。



打开一个终端，并运行下面的命令：

sudo apt updatesudo apt upgrade


或者，你也可以打开软件包更新程序。安装所有的准备就绪的软件包。

在两个命令完成后，打开软件包更新。你将会看到一个升级到 Ubuntu 22.10 的提示（如下图所示）。



现在，单击 “升级Upgrade” 按钮，并按照屏幕上的说明进行操作。升级过程需要一些时间，因此，要耐心等待，直至升级完成。确保在整个升级过程中有稳定的互联网链接。

如果你尚未获得更新，请等待一、两天后再次尝试。

如果你没有看到上述提示，手动重新启动一次系统。并再次添加尝试。

通过终端

在终端中通过 nano 文件编辑器打开下面的文件。

nano /etc/update-manager/release-upgrades


将 Prompt=LTS 更改为 Prompt=normal 。注意：如果你已经如上所述将更新标签页更改为 “任意新的版本For any new version” ，那么这个文件应该已经更新了。但是，要验证它一次。



分别按下组合键 CTRL+O 和组合键 CTRL+X 来保存和退出。

最后，你也可以运行下面的命令来从终端中强制升级过程。

sudo do-release-upgrade -c




升级过程需要花费一些时间（最少半个小时，上不封顶），这主要取决于你的互联网连接和硬件。直至等到其完成。在完成后，重新启动并享受 Ubuntu 22.10 Kinetic Kudu.



在升级过程进行时，看看我们 不久前发布的关于 Ubuntu 22.10 的精彩文章。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Systemd version 252 has been released.  As usual, the list of changes is
long.  It includes a new systemd-measure tool for the calculation of PCR
values and a bunch of infrastructure to use the result for disk encryption:


	Net effect: if you boot a properly prepared kernel, TPM-bound disk
        encryption now defaults to be locked to kernels which carry PCR
          signatures from the same key pair. Example: if a hypothetical distro
          FooOS prepares its UKIs like this, TPM-based disk encryption is now –
          by default – bound to only FooOS kernels, and encrypted volumes bound
          to the TPM cannot be unlocked on kernels from other sources.


There's a lot more; see the announcement for all of the details.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Linux security module (LSM) mechanism was created as a result of the first Kernel Summit in 2001; it was
designed to allow the development of multiple approaches to Linux security.
That goal has been met; there are several security modules available with
current kernels.  The LSM subsystem was not designed, though, to allow
multiple security modules to work together on the same system.  Developers
have been working to rectify that problem almost since the LSM subsystem
was merged, but with limited success; some small security modules can be
stacked on top of the "major" ones, but arbitrary stacking is not possible.
Now, a full 20 years after
security-module support went into the 2.5 development kernel series, it
looks like a solution to the stacking problem may finally be getting
closer.]]></summary>

So I ask: do you have a procedure in place to grant or transfer access in case of death?
My first idea would be using a password manager for everything, list every device used for 2SA and confine within my will a master password.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Wikipedia has an entire page criticizing Linux, collecting information given by the developers of the Kernel and even Linus himself. However, the sources of these information seem to be a bit old (most of them are from around 2000-2012).
 Most of these issues will definitely be resolved as time goes on, such as bad hardware support and lower game market-share. Other points aren't actually issues, but rather depend on how you consider them; such as distribution fragmentation. However, the most concerning point of that article is the following:
  
In an interview with German newspaper Zeit Online in November 2011, Linus Torvalds stated that Linux has become "too complex" and he was concerned that developers would not be able to find their way through the software anymore. He complained that even subsystems have become very complex and he told the publication that he is "afraid of the day" when there will be an error that "cannot be evaluated anymore."
  
and:
  
Q: Is it your opinion that the quality of the kernel is in decline? Most developers seem to be pretty sanguine about the overall quality problem. Assuming there's a difference of opinion here, where do you think it comes from? How can we resolve it? 
 A: I used to think [code quality] was in decline, and I think that I might think that it still is. I see so many regressions which we never fix.
  
In other points of the article, it was said that Linus considers the kernel to be bloated.
 I'm wondering, will something be done to fix this issue that even Linus considers concerning? I really love Linux but these issues hinder my ability to sleep at night.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[据第一财经，日前有市场传闻称，以中信为首的财团正在接洽腾讯南非大股东，拟全额收购其手中的腾讯股票，拿下腾讯控股权。


此前腾讯发布财报显示，腾讯控股今年上半年收入2695.05亿元，同比下滑1%；净利润420.32亿元，同比重挫53%。而根据腾讯2022年中期报告，其第一大股东MIH TC由南非报业集团Naspers全资子公司Prosus所控制。经过多轮减持，南非报业集团Naspers对腾讯持股比例已经从最初的46%降至当前的27.99%。腾讯股价在2022年以来大跌，不过，若要收购其大股东手中的股票，中信仍要支出大约5000多亿港元。


面对Naspers持续不断的减持，目前腾讯公司一直在出资回购，并且已经耗资一千多亿港元来承接Naspers的巨大抛盘，但如果要让腾讯继续掏钱回购剩下的6000亿港元股权，确实也有很大的难度。南非大股东持有腾讯28%股份，约合700亿美元，一家财团拿下可能有点困难，但是要是几家国资共同发起收购也不是不可能。

我喜欢 Linux 桌面这件事对任何读过我作品的人来说都不会感到惊讶。我的意思是，我曾经是一个早已消失的出版物《Linux 桌面》的主要作者和编辑。那么，为什么我在底特律召开的 Kubecon 北美峰会上，在我的惠普 Chromebook x360 上写这篇文章呢？

很简单，因为 Chrome OS 是一个 Linux 发行版。以前是，以后也是。

而这让一些 Linux 粉丝很恼火。他们对 Linux 桌面未来的设想是让每个人都“运行 Ubuntu，不是 Fedora 或 Arch Linux！”，“拜托，Linux Mint 才是赢家”，“MX Linux”，“现实点吧！使用 openSUSE Tumbleweed！” 等等，不一而足。有 上千种 Linux 发行版，这就是我们永远不会看到他们的 “Linux 桌面消灭 Windows” 的梦想实现的一个重要原因。

但 Chromebook 不同。当然，Chromebook 的销售已经 崩溃 了，但部分原因是 Chromebook 太皮实耐用了。与 Windows 机器不同的是，Windows 机器的寿命大概是三年，而我有的 Chromebook 已经运行了七年了。

的确，它们的 自动更新到期（AUE）日期 已经成为过去了，所以我不能再获得自动更新。但是，那又怎样？甚至谷歌也 承认 你可以在它们的平均五年到期日期之后继续使用它们。

而如果是 Windows，那就不一样了。任何仍在运行 Windows 7 的人都是邀请黑客来黑他，除非他们购买了 扩展安全更新（ESU）合同。而且，即使是这样，ESU 也将在 2023 年 1 月结束。

 I'm not sure if it's allowed to post links to webshops. I can post it if you want to see for yourself.
 Edit: Thanks for all your comments. I just noticed that the site has some links on the bottom of every page that explain what Linux is and give proper credit, so I guess everything is above board.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[谷歌给出了废弃 JPEG-XL 的理由：不爱了

昨天我们 报道 过，谷歌准备在 Chrome 110 中废弃 JPEG-XL 的实验性支持。对此，谷歌的一位工程师给出了他们的理由：实验性标志和代码不应该无限期地保留下去；整个生态系统没有足够的兴趣继续实验；新的图像格式并没有带来足够的增量优势；减少维护负担。而事实上，JPEG-XL d 比特流在 2020 年底才被冻结，文件格式在去年才被标准化，编码系统在今年早些时候才被标准化。

国外网友发现他的猫在“使用”百度

一位国外网友给自己的猫买了一个自动喂食器，但是他发现这个喂食器每隔五分钟就会解析一下 baidu.com 的域名。经过研究，原来这个带有摄像头、WiFi 功能和云端服务的物联网设备，会通过解析 baidu.com 来判断网络联通性。而这是硬编码到其设备代码中的，并且使用了过期的解析库。至于为什么会解析百度而不是谷歌，显然这是一台中国生产的物联网设备。

苹果公司增加了漏洞赏金，但不准备针对之前的操作系统

苹果安全博客带来了修订后的漏洞赏金的消息，有些漏洞赏金最高是以前最高赏金的两倍，一个零点击远程攻击链的理论最高赏金可达 200 万美元。但与此同时，苹果已经表示，旧的操作系统版本可能无法获得所有已知安全问题的修复。


消息来源：The Register



老王点评：虽然说是苹果的操作系统是免费升级，但是老设备是不能一直升级下去的，所以，换新设备吧。]]></summary>

We’ve chosen to use Svelte so our flows would be lightweight (it is ~50kb gzipped).
Next up:
- Adding forms and components for it to be used as a full onboarding flow.
- Releasing an open-source case management dashboard, for manual approval of users.
- Releasing an open-source rule engine, to help automate decisions.
We’d love to hear your feedback, suggestions, or any question you’ve got.
And if the rest of the project is relevant or interesting to you, follow us and, we’ll update you once new things are available.
Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Based on the kernel source code zswap is a backend for frontswap. Frontswap provides a “transcendent memory” interface for swap pages. In some cases we can get increased performance by saving swapped pages in RAM (or a RAM-like device) and not on disk as swap partition\swapfile (https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/v4.18/vm/frontswap.html). The frontends are usually implemented in the kernel while the backend is implemented as a kernel module (as we will show soon). Zswap takes pages that are in the process of being swapped out and attempts to compress and store them in a RAM-based memory pool. (https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/latest/source/mm/zswap.c).
 We can say that zswap trades CPU cycles for potentially reduced swap I/O. A significant performance improvement can happen in case the reads from the swap device are much slower than the reads from the compressed cache (https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/v4.18/vm/zswap.html). The “zswap_frontswap_store” is the function that attempts to compress and store a single page (https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v6.1-rc2/source/mm/zswap.c#L1097).
 The kernel thread “zswap-shrink” is created created based on a workqueue (https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v6.1-rc2/source/mm/zswap.c#L1511). On my VM (Ubuntu 22.04.1) zswap is compiled part of the kernel itself and not as a separate “*.ko” (kernel module). You can see in the screenshot below that it does not appear in the output of “lsmod” and is marked as builtin (look at the filename field) in the output of “modinfo”.
 For more information like the compression used by zswap (the default one is lzo) and other parameters that can be configured for zswap I suggest reading the following link https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/zswap. You can also read the parameters on “/sys/module/zswap/parameters”

此外，今日下午，“郑州发布”连发两条消息，通告“富士康给员工连发三条关爱通知：去留自愿，做好保障，并附上返乡乘车地点和电话”，以及“全力以赴确保富士康员工顺利安全返乡”。


针对郑州园区疫情状况，富士康科技集团发布了四点说明:



1、我们深知，在当前疫情形势下，如何做好园区20余万员工的照护与安全保障是一场“持久战”，也关注到了外界对富士康的关心，恳请各界给予理解和支持。


2、照护员工是集团经营的首要原则。当前，在地方政府的指导下，集团郑州园区正持续落实防疫措施，实施了闭环管理、点对点通勤、每日核酸及抗原筛查、免费为员工提供三餐、增设24小时关爱热线、志愿者服务等员工关爱举措，并持续为员工提供最新的防疫信息及宣导。


3、针对园区内的同仁，在符合防疫安全生产规范下，集团会全力保障员工生产安全及健康照护；由政府统筹管理的爱心观察区员工，集团也会尽最大努力，持续协调地方政府，为员工提供必要的物资供给与生活保障；目前园区内相关物资供应充足，会待疫情逐步稳定后，恢复先前因防疫而暂停的堂食等正常措施，以提高员工生活的便利性与满意度；针对部分有返乡意愿的员工，园区已联合政府统一组织人员和车辆，从今日起做好员工点对点有序返乡服务。


4、郑州园区与政府配合防疫，目前状况已在逐步控制之中，集团也会协调其他厂区产能备援，以降低可能的影响。



据“郑州发布”微信公众号最新消息，10月30日，记者从郑州航空港区疫情防控指挥部获悉，富士康将统一组织人员和车辆，全力以赴确保富士康员工顺利安全返乡。


对于近期一些有返乡意愿的员工，本着充分尊重员工意愿的原则，航空港区积极与相关员工输出地政府沟通和协调，在严格落实疫情防控规定的前提下，安排公安、交通、属地办事处和富士康企业，统一组织人员和车辆，启动员工点对点返乡工作。


在返乡前，充分尊重员工的去留意愿，与企业员工进行充分沟通，去留自愿，并做好点对点保障。按照疫情防控规定，加强返乡员工做好个人防护，安排核酸检测，协调省内相关地区做好接收，点对点闭环运输车辆，确保员工安全有序返乡。


对于自愿留在企业生产生活的员工，将进一步优化、细化各项疫情防控措施，定期对厂区、员工宿舍消毒，在确保安全的前提下，全力组织好企业无疫情车间厂区的生产。同时，将积极做好在企员工的食宿、核酸检测、身体健康保障等工作，为员工提供医疗及关爱服务，开放线上、线下各类咨询渠道，竭尽全力为员工提供后勤服务及关爱保障。

JPEG-XL 作为一种免版税的下一代有损/无损图像格式，其性能比 JPEG 好得多，因此被人们所看好。JPEG-XL 部分是基于谷歌的 PIK 提案，该文件格式在去年才被标准化。自 Chrome 91 以来，谷歌浏览器通过一个功能标志启用 JPEG-XL 支持，但谷歌正在考虑在 Chrome 110 中废除对该图像的支持。目前还没有公开的评论，说明他们放弃 JPEG-XL 的理由，但是谷歌方面一直在积极推广他们的 WebP 格式。


消息来源：Phoronix



老王点评：看来还是谷歌觉得 JPEG-XL 不够亲儿子。




VMware 为过期版本修补了一个高危漏洞

VMware 修补了一个影响其 VMware Cloud Foundation 和 NSX Manager 产品的高危漏洞，该漏洞允许未经授权的黑客以最高的系统权限执行恶意代码。该漏洞危险等级 9.8/10，存在于其所依赖的 XStream 开源库中，因为危险是如此之高，VMware 不同寻常的为不再支持的版本发布了补丁。


消息来源：Solidot



老王点评：还不错，还会为停止支持的过期产品提供安全补丁。




FreeBSD 再次引入 WireGuard

早在 2020 年，FreeBSD 就引入了 WireGuard，但后来发现其初始实现代码太烂，而在 FreeBSD 13 RC 期间被移除。后来，WireGuard 的上游开发者亲自出手参与了其在 FreeBSD 的实现，经过两年的精细打磨，终于在周五重新进入了 FreeBSD 内核。预计它将出现在 FreeBSD 14 中，之前版本的 FreeBSD 也将会向后移植。


消息来源：Phoronix



老王点评：为 FreeBSD 的精益求精点赞。]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[GNOME 有了一个全新的文本编辑器，以取代旧的 Gedit 编辑器。

虽然 GNOME 42 已经可以使用了它，但 Ubuntu 22.04 还依赖于 Gedit。

这在 Ubuntu 22.10 中发生了变化。 GNOME 文本编辑器Text Editor 现在是默认程序，甚至没有安装 Gedit。



虽然新编辑器足够好，但并不是每个人都喜欢它。如果你将 Gedit 与其他插件一起频繁使用，则尤其如此。

如果你属于这类人，让我向你展示如何在 Ubuntu 上安装 Gedit。我还将分享如何将其设为默认文本编辑器。

在 Ubuntu 上安装 Gedit

这实际上是不费吹灰之力的。虽然默认未安装 Gedit，但它仍然可以在 Ubuntu 仓库中找到。

所以，你所要做的就是使用 apt 命令来安装它：

sudo apt install gedit


Gedit 也可以在软件中心中找到，但它是 Snap 包。如果你愿意，你可以安装它。



安装 Gedit 插件（可选）

默认情况下，Gedit 为你提供访问一些插件的选项。你可以从 “汉堡菜单->偏好Preference->插件Plugins” 启用或禁用插件。



你可以在这里看到可用的插件。检查已安装或正在使用的插件。



但是，你可以通过安装 gedit-plugins 元数据包将插件选择提升到一个新的水平。

sudo apt install gedit-plugins


这将使你可以访问其他插件，如书签、括号补全、Python 控制台等。



提示：如果你发现 Gedit 因缺少底角而显得有些格格不入，你可以安装一个名为 Round Bottom Corner 的 GNOME 扩展。这将为包括 Gedit 在内的所有应用强制添加圆底角。

使 Gedit 成为默认文本编辑器

好了！你已经安装了 Gedit，但文本文件仍然在双击操作后使用 GNOME 文本编辑器打开。要使用 Gedit 打开文件，你需要右键单击，然后选择“打开方式open with”选项。

如果你希望一直使用 Gedit 打开文本文件，你可以将其设置为默认程序。

右键单击文本文件并选择“打开方式open with”选项。在此处选择 Gedit 并从底部启用“始终用于此文件类型Always use for this file type”选项。



删除 Gedit

觉得 Gedit 没达到预期么？这很少见，但我不会评判你。要从 Ubuntu 中删除 Gedit，请使用以下命令：

sudo apt remove gedit


你也可以尝试从软件中心卸载它。

总结

GNOME 文本编辑器是下一代从头开始创建的编辑器，它与新的 GNOME 完美融合。

对于简单的文本编辑来说已经足够了。然而，Gedit 有一个插件生态系统，赋予它更多功能。

对于那些将它广泛用于编码和其他事情的人来说，安装 Gedit 仍然是 Ubuntu 中的一个选项。

那你呢？你会坚持使用默认的新文本编辑器还是回到旧的 Gedit？

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[组织层面的自动化一直是一个难以实现的目标，但 Kubernetes 或许能够改变这一切。


当我在 2002 年采用 Gentoo Linux 作为我的主要操作系统时，我开始了我的自动化之旅。二十年后，自动化还没有完成。当我与客户和合作伙伴会面时，他们分享了团队内部的自动化成果，但他们也描述了在组织层面实现类似成功所面临的挑战。

大多数 IT 组织都能够端到端地提供虚拟机，从而将过去 4 周的交付周期缩短到仅 5 分钟。这种级别的自动化本身就是一个复杂的工作流程，需要网络（IP 地址管理、DNS、代理、网络区域等）、身份访问管理、虚拟机管理程序、存储、备份、更新操作系统、应用最新的配置文件、监控、安全和强化以及合规性基准测试，等等。哇，这么多！

满足高速、可扩展和按需自动化的业务需求并不容易。例如，来看看经典的网上商店或提交纳税申报表的在线政府服务，其工作负载有明确的峰值需要面对。

处理此类负载的一种常见方法是拥有一个超大的服务器集群，以供 IT 专业人员的特定团队使用，监控客户或公民的季节性涌入。每个人都希望及时部署整个栈。他们希望基础架构在混合云场景的上下文中运行工作负载，使用“构建-消耗-回收build-consume-trash”模型来优化成本，同时从无限弹性中受益。

换句话说，每个人都想要乌托邦式的“云体验”。

云真的能交付吗？

尚有一线机会，这主要归功于 Kubernetes 的设计方式。Kubernetes 的指数级普及推动了创新，取代了管理平台和应用的标准传统做法。 Kubernetes 需要使用 “万物皆代码Everything-as-Code”（EaC）来定义从简单的计算节点到 TLS 证书的所有资源的期望状态。Kubernetes 强制使用三种主要的设计结构：


一个标准接口，以减少内部和外部组件之间的整合问题

API 优先及仅 API 的方法来标准化其所有组件的 CRUD（创建、读取、更新、删除）操作

使用 YAML 作为通用语言，以简单易读的方式定义这些组件的所有所需状态


这三个关键组成部分基本上是选择自动化平台的相同要求，至少如果你想让跨职能团队轻松采用是这样的。这也模糊了团队之间的职责分工，有助于提高跨越孤岛的协作，这是一件好事！

事实上，采用 Kubernetes 的客户和合作伙伴正在加速进入超自动化状态。Kubernetes 有机地推动团队采用多种 DevOps 基础和实践，如：EaC、使用 Git 进行版本控制、同行评审、文档即代码Documentation as Code，并鼓励跨职能协作。这些实践有助于提高团队的自动化技能，并帮助团队在处理应用生命周期和基础架构的 GitOps 和 CI/CD 管道方面取得良好的开端。

让自动化成为现实

你没看错！网络商店或政府报告等复杂系统的整个栈可以用清晰、可理解、通用的术语定义，可以在任何本地或云提供商上执行。可以定义具有自定义指标的自动伸缩器以触发所需栈的即时部署，以解决季节性高峰期间客户或市民的涌入问题。当指标恢复正常，且云计算资源不再有存在的理由时，你将它们回收并恢复常规运营，而由一组核心资产在本地接管业务，直到下一次激增。

鸡和蛋的悖论

考虑到 Kubernetes 和云原生模式，自动化是必须的。但它提出了一个重要的问题：一个组织可以在解决自动化战略之前采用 Kubernetes 吗？

似乎从 Kubernetes 开始可以激发更好的自动化，但这并不是一个一成不变的结论。工具不是对技能、实践和文化问题的解决方案。但是，设计良好的平台可以成为 IT 组织内学习、变革和跨职能协作的催化剂。

开始使用 Kubernetes

即使你觉得自己错过了自动化列车，也不要害怕从简单、不复杂的栈上开始使用 Kubernetes。当你 掌握了初始步骤，就可以拥抱这个出色的编排系统的简单性，并根据更复杂的需求进行迭代。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[滚动发布的 Ubuntu 发行版？等等，什么？ Rhino Linux 听起来不错……




Rhino Linux 将成为 Rolling Rhino Remix 的继任者。这个由 http.llamaz 构建的 Linux 发行版，提供了滚动发布的非官方的 Ubuntu 变体版本。

需要澄清的是，该项目从未旨在取代其他稳定的发行版，而纯粹是一个充满乐趣的激情项目。

而随着人们开始将其用作日常使用并对其期望更多，开发人员决定将其变成一个严肃的项目。

Rhino Linux 作为它的继任者。那么，你对它的期待是什么？

有请继任者 Rhino Linux

其主要目标是提供稳定的 Ubuntu 体验，同时仍提供滚动发布模式。

目标仍保持不变，但 Rhino Linux 的基础将得到彻底改变。他们有可能使它成为一个令人印象深刻的滚动发布的 Ubuntu 发行版。

听起来很令人兴奋！🤯

在其核心，Rhino Linux 将使用稍微修改过的 Xfce 版本作为其桌面环境；之所以选择它是因为它众所周知的稳定性和速度。

Rhino Linux 的创始人提到了以下几点：


滚动版 Ubuntu 仍然是我们的核心理念。Rhino Linux 并不是从 Rolling Rhino Remix 中分离出来的，而是将它重新设想为更稳定、更成熟的发行版，它原本就应该以这种方式出厂。




除此之外，Pacstall 将用作 Rhino Linux 上的默认包管理器及其存储库之一。


💡 Pacstall 是一个受 AUR 启发的 Ubuntu 包管理器。


Pacstall 的开发由其创始人 Plasma 领导。他还作为新开发人员之一（副项目负责人）加入，而 Sourajyoti Basak 作为另一位核心成员加入。

前进：可用性和发布

在撰写本文时，Rhino Linux 尚未确定任何具体的发布日期，但你可以预计它会在 2023 年的某个时间发布。

Rolling Rhino Remix 会发生什么？

开发者澄清说，它将在 Rhino Linux 发布后继续维护三个月。但是，在 2022 年 1 月 11 日后继发布之后，它没有新的发布镜像。

你可以通过访问其 官方网站 了解更多关于 Rhino Linux 的信息。

💬 你觉得 Rhino Linux 怎么样？它可以成为值得尝试的官方 Ubuntu 风格的竞争者吗？

 The question is I don't know if my laptop can handle the new ubuntu release without causing any issues with the hardware.
 I once used fedora on a HP laptop, and it started powering off randomly and I think it is the AMD graphics card as maybe it got damaged.
 I am a bit traumatized with what had happened, and I am afraid of this happening again with my new device so would you give me any advice please!

 What does that mean though? According to what I know of the GPL license, when you distribute a product with open-source components, you have to either license the product under the GPL or pay royalties to the owners of the open-source components.
 There was a case some years ago when a China-based company created a product and rebranded a open-source music playing application as their own. The open-source developers sued, it went to court and the judge upheld the GPL and the China-based company removed all open-sourced components from their product and created their own music player in order to avoid paying royalties to original owners of the code.
 So, is that what Apple is doing then? Paying royalties to open-source developers for every iPhone or Mac sold?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm working on ANSI Parser written in JavaScript for my Open Source project. And I'm looking for examples to stress test my code.
 So far I'm testing against some ANSI Art and output of the script command where I call: dialog, top, vi, and to be complete I just run emacs -nw.
 Do you have any ideas for any other commands that I can test? This needs to produce single output but can be interactive (because I use script command).
 I was also cmatrix but I needed to tweak the file because it was clearing the screen before exit. But it's not good because It's hard to say if the output is correct or not.
