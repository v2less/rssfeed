        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This isn’t intended to be a “hurr Linux better” post, but instead a legitimate discussion because I legitimately don’t get it. What the fuck are normal people supposed to do?
 The standard argument against Linux always seems to center around the notion that sometimes things break and sometimes to recover from said broken states you need to use the terminal which people don’t want.
 This seems kinda ridiculous, originally I went from dual boot to full time Linux around the time 10 first launched because I tried to upgrade and it completely fucked my system. Now that’s happening again with 11. People are upgrading and it’s completely breaking their systems. 
 Between the time I originally got screwed by 10 and the present day I’ve tried to fix these types of issues a dozen different times for people, both on 10 and 11. Usually it seems to manifest as either a recovery loop or as a completely unusably slow system. I’ve honestly managed to fix maybe 2 of these without just wiping and reinstalling everything which often does seem to be the only real option.
 I get that Linux isn’t always perfect for everyone, but it’s absurd to pretend that Windows is actually easier or more stable. Windows is a god awful product, as soon as anything goes wrong you’re SOL. At this point I see why so many people just use iPads or android tablets for home computing needs, at least those are going to actually work after you update them.
 None of this to even mention the fact that you’re expecting people to download executables off random internet pages to install software. It’s dangerous and a liability if you don’t know what to watch out for. This is exactly why so many people end up with adware and malware on their systems.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I was just a regular guy who liked computers and gadgets a lot. I started using Linux as my primary OS about a year ago. It's been quite an adventure. From struggling to install a distro, then distro-hopping, falling in love with CLI and TUI programs, to settling on Arch and then discovering window managers and a whole another world of customization. During this time, I kept learning more and more about free and open-source software. I was really fascinated by it -- so much so that I wanted to contribute to it. So I decided to learn to code. Started out with Python and now I'm learning Rust along with it. So far, I've built a TUI program in Python to track activities, a WhatsApp web automation library (WIP) and now a Rust CLI utility to manage backlight on Linux (especially on laptops with Hybrid GPU configuration) which I recently published on Crates.io. All of them, free and open-source. 
 I just wanted to share this small story about my journey with Linux, and I want to say that it's been wonderful being part of the community and learning and growing along the way. I'm still a beginner and I have a lot to learn, but now I wake up everyday feeling excited to learn and build more. And I can't wait to contribute to the projects that I rely on everyday. I don't think I would be doing what I'm doing now if I hadn't decided to install Linux that day. So yeah, cheers to that!

However recently (a few months ago) I picked up a new laptop with an 1440p 14 inch display, and was introduced to the dumpster fire that is scaling on Linux. I genuinely do not understand why getting good looking scaling on all of the apps I use is so difficult. Granted I'm no developer, so I could be completely missing something, but is it really that hard to just make everything bigger? Especially with QT apps, it looks horrible. The text is large, but all of the UI elements are absolutely tiny, so it ends up looking uneven and just bad. Sometimes it renders the apps completely unusable, like with Kwrite. Mac OS and Windows handle it almost perfectly, with just a single slider that doesn't drop your display resolution or font clarity, and just makes everything bigger. With Linux, you have to edit a billion different configs for different GUI frameworks, or edit each individual app config, or you just cant do anything and your stuck with tiny unusable font and tiny unusable UI elements. Again, I'm no developer, so there might be something that I don't understand. However I also don't see why all of the major GUI frameworks can't listen to one global variable that's set by the DE or WM, and just go off that.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[当地时间8月5日，亚马逊在其官网发布消息，宣布将以每股61美元的价格的收购全球扫地机器人龙头iRobot，此价格较 iRobot 8月4日收盘价49.99美元溢价22%。交易总价约为17亿美元。


　　此次收购将成为亚马逊收购史上的第四大笔交易，次于2017年以137亿美元收购美国有机食品连锁超市全食超市（Whole Foods），今年3月以85亿美元收购好莱坞电影制片公司米高梅（Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer），以及上个月以39亿美元收购医疗保健提供商One Medical。

　　实际上，这两家公司早有合作。2016年，iRobot将其关键任务型平台迁移到亚马逊AWS服务器上。此外，该公司为产品加入智能化语音功能时选择了亚马逊语音助手Alexa。


　　目前尚不清楚交易完成并获得监管机构批准后，iRobot将如何与亚马逊合作，但亚马逊打算让科林·安格尔继续担任iRobot的首席执行官。


　　iRobot创始人兼CEO科林?安格尔（Colin Angle）表示，iRobot成立以来，一直致力于创造实用且新颖的产品，致力于让用户生活得更加轻松。“亚马逊和我们一样，热衷于打造造福用户的新产品，我认为与亚马逊一起是iRobot最好的归宿，在这里能够继续完成我们的使命。成为亚马逊的一员，我非常兴奋，并期待着未来我们能够一起创造什么。”


　　交易完成后，安格尔将继续担任iRobot的首席执行官。


　　宣布收购消息的同一天，iRobot公布其截至2022年7月2日的第二季度业绩，通用会计准则下，营收2.55亿美元，营业亏损 6390 万美元，每股净亏损1.6美元。


　　截至发稿，亚马逊微涨0.06%，iRobot涨超19%。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[GitLab 将归档免费用户的不活跃项目

之前，有报道称 GitLab 计划自动删除不活跃时间超过一年的免费用户项目，以节省托管费用，此举预计能每年节省一百万美元。这一消息立即引发了争议。周五 GitLab 通过官方 Twitter 账号发表声明，它在内部讨论之后决定不删除不活跃项目，而是将这些代码库转移到对象存储中，访问速度会比较慢。


消息来源：Solidot



老王点评：这真能减少那么多费用支出吗？我表示怀疑。但是无论如何，我觉得 GitLab 不管是哪种做法，其实都不是好的做法。另外，这是否也代表着 GitLab 的日子不太好过？




Linux 可能会废弃对 DECnet 协议的支持

微软的一位工程师建议从 Linux 内核中删除 DECnet 协议处理代码。DECnet 代码的最后一位维护者在 2010 年将该代码标记为孤儿代码。这一变化对大多数人是没有影响的。VMS 是最后一个使用 DECnet 的主流操作系统，而且 VMS 已经支持 TCP/IP 很长时间了。有趣的是，就在两周前，VMS 软件公司再次宣布 OpenVMS 9.2 这次真的准备好了。TCP/IP 并不是唯一的网络协议，而且在 90 年代中期，它甚至不是主导协议。Linux 内核曾经支持多种网络协议，但它们正在迅速消失。


消息来源：The Register



老王点评：不知不觉中，那个并不严格符合 OSI 的 TCP/IP 几乎成了唯一选择，而老旧协议们纷纷进入了历史，比如，有谁还记得 Novell 的 IPX 协议？




Cloudflare 推出后量子实验，为抗量子破解做准备

Cloudflare 正在推出一项后量子实验，以增加对两种混合后量子密钥协议的支持，所有网站所有者都可以报名参加。目前在网站上添加这些密钥协议不会有什么作用，因为还没有网络浏览器支持它们。浏览器遇到这些加密方案时将退回到现有的方式，因此自然也不具有抗量子性。Cloudflare 表示，互联网将在未来几年内向量子加密技术发展，并希望这个测试版能给其客户一个尝试的先机。Cloudflare 正在使用的后量子密码学被称为 Kyber。上个月，美国国家标准与技术研究所（NIST）决定对 Kyber 进行标准化，最终规范将于 2024 年出台。


消息来源：CloudFlare



老王点评：虽然几乎没什么用，但是这是一种有趣的尝试和实验，我想可能很快就会有一些浏览器配合来进行后量子加密了。]]></summary>

        <id>https://linux.cn/article-14900-1.html?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss</id>
        <link href="https://linux.cn/article-14900-1.html?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss"/>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[基于 Slackware 的 Slax 版本在 Slackware 15.0 的基础上进行了升级，并带来一些基本的改进。




Slax 是最有趣的 轻量级 Linux 发行版 之一。

它是基于 Slackware 的，是 32 位系统的一个合适选择。如果你尚不知道，Slackware 是最古老的、活跃的 Linux 发行版，并在 6 年后见证了一次重大版本升级，即 Slackware 15 的发布。

此外，Slax 还提供了一个基于 Debian 的替代版本，该版本正在积极维护。正如创作者在博文中提到的，这是由于基于 Slackware 的版本（Slax 14）在很长一段时间内（9 年）没有得到更新。

因此，看到最终以 Slax 15.0 的形式发布了重大升级版本，以及也对其 Debian 版本（即 Slax 11.4.0）进行小幅更新，还是令人感动。

有趣的是，这个版本早在 2022 年 7 月就向其支持者提供了。而现在，所有人都可以下载和试用了。

让我来介绍一下新的变化。

Slax 15.0 和 Slax 11.4 发布

为了解决关键的升级问题，Slax 15.0 带来了 Slackware 15.0 中添加的改进。

这应该包括增加了 Linux 内核 5.15 LTS，即增强的 NTFS 驱动支持，以及对英特尔/AMD 处理器的支持改进。你可以看看这个内核变体，提供了更多内置驱动程序，或者了解一下节省内存和启动时警告的通用选项。

该个发布版本通过插件支持 slackpkg，这意味着你可以从各种软件库中安装软件，包括官方的 Slackware 仓库和 SlackOnly 仓库。

Slax 15.0 还涉及到一个更新的关机程序，对设备的卸载处理更加完善。

考虑到 Slax 不再是一个基于 KDE 的发行版。因此，当你下载 Slackware 或 Debian 版本的 ISO 时，你得到的是一个基于 Fluxbox 的版本。

而对于 Debian 版本，你会发现它的更新是基于 Debian 11.4 “Bullseye” 的。

下载 Slax 15.0 和 Slax 11.4

你无法找到基于 Slackware 的版本的 32 位版本，而只能找到基于 Debian 的。

其 ISO 文件可以在其官方网站上下载。如果你想以某种方式支持该项目，也可以选择购买。


Slax 15.0


无论哪种情况，你都可以前往其 Patreon 页面 以示支持。

你对 Slax 15.0 的发布有什么看法？你试过了吗？

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[这个快速教程展示了在 Ubuntu Linux 上安装最新版本的 Vim 的步骤。


Vim 是最 流行的基于终端的文本编辑器 之一。然而，它在 Ubuntu 上没有被默认安装。

Ubuntu 使用 Nano 作为默认的终端编辑器。Nano 也是一个优秀的工具，我并不打算参与 Nano 与 Vim 孰优孰劣的辩论。

如果你已经花了一些时间掌握了 Vim 的快捷键，你就不必忘记它们，而开始使用一个新的编辑器。

你可以在终端使用以下命令在 Ubuntu 上安装 Vim：

sudo apt install vim


这很简单，对吗？这种方法的主要问题是，你不会得到最新的 Vim 版本。

你可以用以下命令检查已安装的 Vim 版本：

vim --version


而如果你查看 Vim 网站，你会发现 Vim 已经发布了更新的版本。

在写这篇文章的时候，Vim 9.0 已经发布，但在 Ubuntu 仓库中还没有。

好消息是，你可以使用一个 非官方的，但积极维护的 PPA 安装最新的 Vim。

使用 PPA 在 Ubuntu 上安装 Vim 9

如果你有特定的 Vim 配置文件，为它们做个备份也无妨。

现在，要安装最新的 Vim 版本，先添加 PPA 仓库：

sudo add-apt-repository ppa:jonathonf/vim




你不需要在 Ubuntu 上更新软件包缓存，但其他发行版如 Mint 可能仍然需要：

sudo apt update


现在，使用下面的命令来安装 PPA 提供的最新 Vim 版本：

sudo apt install vim


如果你已经安装了一个较早的 Vim 版本，它将被升级。你可以用以下方法检查已安装的 Vim 版本：

vim --version




这是一个维护得非常好的 PPA，适用于所有活跃的 Ubuntu 版本。

如果你是 PPA 的新手，我有一个关于这个主题的详细指南。你应该阅读以对 Ubuntu 中 PPA 的概念 了解更多。

降级或删除

如果你想回到 Ubuntu 提供的旧版 Vim，你应该删除现有的版本，删除 PPA 并重新安装它。

在删除 Vim 之前，如果你做了自定义修改并打算再次使用 Vim，你应该复制 vimrc 或其他类似的配置文件。

那么，打开一个终端，使用以下命令：

sudo apt remove vim


现在删除 PPA，否则你会再次得到最新的 Vim（如果你尝试安装旧版本的 Vim）：

sudo add-apt-repository -r ppa:jonathonf/vim


现在，如果你想要旧的、官方的 Ubuntu 版本的 Vim，只需再次 使用 apt 命令 安装它。

享受 Ubuntu 上的 Vim 吧。

《镰刀与城市——以上海为例的死亡社会史研究》，[法]安克强（Christian Henriot）著，刘喆译，上海社会科学院出版社2022年1月出版，402页，88.00元

历史研究绝大多数情况下都在与死亡打交道——除了极少数当代史研究还能找到当事人，其他时段的历史研究都是对那些早已逝去多年甚至是成百上千年的人事进行探究。但专门对死亡展开研究的历史作品却并不多见，而死亡又是涉及社会、政治、经济、文化、思想等许多方面的重要课题，更是反映时代变迁、思想转变和城乡变化等历史的主题，在我们的历史研究中不应该缺位。

安克强教授的新作《镰刀与城市——以上海为例的死亡社会史研究》算是上海死亡社会史领域的开山之作，也与新近出版的《公墓与近代上海的城市变迁（1909-1937）》共同推进了上海殡葬史的研究。

安克强教授是著名的上海史研究专家，也是法国第三代现代中国研究者中的佼佼者，在中国近现代史尤其上海史研究方面著述甚丰，此前已经有多部著作翻译成中文出版，如《上海妓女：19-20世纪中国的卖淫与性》《1927-1937年的上海——市政权、地方性和现代化》等，在学界影响甚大。《镰刀与城市》的初衷，用作者的话来说，“是为了探索那些历史中死者的心性，期望能书写一部社会文化史，既包含和尸体有关的行为和规定，又包含和死亡、悲伤、哀悼有关的个人情感”（《镰刀与城市》第6页，后文引用该书只标注页码）。但实际上呈现出来的作品，主要还是关于上海如何处理死者的问题，或者如叶文心所说是“探讨了一座城市是如何对待其市民死去后的尸体”（封底推荐语）。作者自己在中文版序中也重新表述为“探索作为社会经历的死亡，即中国城市社会如何自我组织和应对日常生活中持续存在且增长中的死亡人口”。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've recently started work on a file manager in Go and FLTK and I just started implementing icons and mimetype reading. The way I've gone about doing it is simply shelling out to the xdg-mime command, but it's very slow at determining types and it takes several seconds to assign icons to a couple hundred files.
 One solution I've thought of would be to index which files have already been looked at (storing their names, mimetypes, time stamps and only re-scanning them if the time stamp is modified) but this seems patchy and would still be slow for the first time of looking at a directory.
 What's the best way to do this? I've looked at libraries but there seems to be none for Go that actually use the system's mime database (which I consider a necessity as users may extend their system with custom types) and I'd like my file manager to be compatible.

 I'm wondering if I should use the onboard Windows 11 Pro or move over to Linux, now why would Linux be better and why would it be worse? Pros and Cons
 Specs:
 -16GB DDR4
 -5700U Mobile Series
 -Radeon (something, haven't bothered to check)
 The specs are excellent and fits Linux like a charm! I'm thinking about going down to the barebones and installing arch on this laptop, so if you have any experience with Linux in school please enlighten me!

Never used it before, I thought it was all just Ubuntu, kinda like how there was Windows 7, then 10, 11, etc. (We don't talk about 8). But my wife's old laptop she used for college was starting to show its age. Booting up took ages and took even longer just to right click on desktop. It was some crappy Dell laptop that had crap specs even when it released, and when the hard drive started failing I knew Win11 wasn't really a choice. So, guess it's time to throw on Linux Ubuntu, right? 
 Googled and went right down the rabbit hole of what the whole Linux ecosystem is. Ubuntu is just one distro, and there's at least thousands of them. Oh god there's a lot. But most all of them are free! Spent a weekend googling until I finally settled on Zorin OS: good f…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[My dad got really sick a few months ago. I was shocked but also panicked about the idea of him dying without me knowing him well. He was a great dad but didn't talk much.
Fortunately, he got better for a short time. I seized the opportunity to ask him as much as he could answer and film him. Of course, his memory wasn't perfect but I got the big picture.
Now that he passed away, I'm both devastated and glad that I got to know him more and kept a record so I can see his face and listen to his voice for more than the usual family video. I wish I had done it sooner though.
I've heard multiple people tell me they don't know their parents' or grandparents' life, or they've heard it  but they've eventually forgotten so I thought I'd share. I hope this will help some of you.
Thank you blood donors
Thank you dad

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[For this palette, I used recent advances in color science, which made perceptual design more accessible, to choose a set of colors (mainly for syntax highlighting) that have uniform luminance for less visually uneven, fluidly readable code, but at the same time maximally distinguishable hue and chroma. The background colors are based on natural (sun-)light and shade for a more pleasing look than equally neutral greys.
For much more detailed info, including the construction, check out the repository.
There’s also already a (bare-bones) VSCode extension, linked in the repository, but it could admittedly use more informed distribution of colors over tokens, language specific highlighting and perhaps more opinionated use in UI elements.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello!
 I've been programming in C# on Windows for quite a few years but I've recently decided to switch to Linux, mainly out of privacy concerns.
 So far I like it, but I would really like to contribute something to the community and I happen to have a bit of free time at the moment.
 So I figured it would be the perfect opportunity to start a new open source project, but to be honest, I don't really know what would be useful to the community. I would prefer to start a new project instead of contributing to an existing one, mainly because I enjoy designing apps from scratch.
 The only requirement I have is that it will be in C#, I know this used to be a Windows-only language but it's the language I know best and the SDK is now 100% open source, so that should not be a problem.
 Other than that I'm open to all kinds of suggestions, CLI tool, GUI app, anything really. As long as there is enough interest in it and I have the required expertise, I'll be glad to work on it.
 I really want to work on something that will be useful to the Linux/Open source communities and hopefully you guys will help me do that.
 (I'll decide which project to work on based on the number of upvotes and how much I like the idea. So if you see an idea that you like don't forget to upvote it!)
 Thanks!

that GitLab is planning to start deleting repositories belonging to free
accounts if they have been inactive for at least a year.


	GitLab is aware of the potential for angry opposition to the plan,
	and will therefore give users weeks or months of warning before
	deleting their work. A single comment, commit, or new issue posted
	to a project during a 12-month period will be sufficient to keep

 But again, today at work, after 4 hours trying to make the VPN service work, I had to close my X1 carbon and to open again my MacBook Pro, where I could finally solve the bug (I am a developer).
 I did a really nice rice and I was really productive with the tiling window manager, but again in the real world, where customers need bugfixes fast, I had to use MacOS and stop waisting time (money for the customer) to make my work tool work.
 Is linux only for people with a lot of free time? Is it really not the right tool for a developer that have to be productive?
 Sorry, just wanted to share some of my frustration and ask the community some thoughts about this topic.

 I have a drawer full of older ARM single board computers, but nothing terribly modern/later than a RasPi4. Can anyone recommend a good, powerful, feature-rich SBC that has a supported Red Hat/Centos/Fedora server distribution for it?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So I found out recently, as I'm looking for a new display, that HDMI2.1 doesn't support Linux -- as mentioned in this issue tracker and this Phoronix article. What's more, this isn't blocked by any technical issue, but by legal issues, because the HDMI forum has blocked any open source implementation of HDMI2.1 drivers. This means HDMI2.1 will not work on Linux until: the patent expires, the law changes, or the HDMI forum changes their minds.
 So, HDMI sucks. What can we do about it?
  
Petition? Unlikely to succeed unless some big players in industry get involved.
 Boycott products with HDMI? Could be effective if enough people commit to it, but that means committing to not buying a TV for a quite a while.
 Lobby for legislation that would help prevent private interests from stymieing development of public, open projects?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey. I am a total Linux noob. I'm using Ubuntu 22.04 LTS with the Gnome Desktop Environment. I am actively trying to learn more about computing, though. I am attempting to learn C++, as an example, though so far my knowledge hardly extends beyond writing a "Hello World!" program. Nonetheless, I could definitely be misunderstanding something here, so be forbearant.
 However, there's something that does not make much sense to me.
 Wouldn't it make way more sense if we had fewer distributions, instead of spreading ourselves out on so many fronts? What I mean by that is that currently, Linux has like, thousands of distros. Do we REALLY need them all? Does each really have a purpose that couldn't be fulfilled by another one?
 So as far as I understand, we have distros aimed at beginners, like Ubuntu, which have a GUI, come with many packages pre-installed, and you could probably get away without using the terminal in many cases (though I think learning some basic commands is beneficial, either way). On the other side, we've got minimalist distros like Gentoo.
 And I understand the purpose of, say, Linux Mint. It's a similar OS to Ubuntu, you can also get away with not using the terminal, but it doesn't have snaps and it's not owned by a company, which is crucial for some people. But do we really need, like, a 1000 different distributions? Wouldn't we be better off with, like, 7 "noob", 7 "minimalist", and 10 "intermediate" distros that are all well-supported and serve a purpose? Is so much forking really necessary?
 I just think that since we constitute less than 3% of the desktop marketshare, it would make more sense for us to just concentrate our power on actual improvement of the Linux ecosystem, instead kf creating a bazillion forks.
 Am I wrong? What may I be not comprehending? 
 What do you think? Do you disagree?
 I am eager to hear your thoughts.

often comes with a bit of controversy; developers have been known to object

 Long story short, I had a USB dongle that required being unplugged and replugged every time you rebooted. I'd searched the entire web but couldn't find a fix.
 After many months, I found a method that worked for me, and wanted to share it so anyone with this dongle is spared from the extra workout. Feel free to correct anything.
  
The device is a Linksys AE1200, and USB databases list it as 13b1:0039 – as you can see here: https://usb-ids.gowdy.us/read/UD/13b1/0039
 The problem is that, when you reboot the PC, 13b1:0039 gets recognized as 13b1:0bdc, which prevents it from loading the brcmfmac kernel module... Because "0bdc" is not a real product. A tedious workaround was to physically unplug and replug it, since it gets identified as "0039" the second tim…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[On his blog, Federico Mena Quintero posted a transcript of his recent talk at GUADEC 2022 on the technical debt in the GNOME accessibility infrastructure—and what he has been doing to help pay that down.  He began the talk by describing the infrastructure and how it came about:

Gnome-shell implements its own toolkit, St, which stands for "shell toolkit". It is made accessible by implementing the GObject interfaces in atk. To make a toolkit accessible means adding a way to extract information from it in a standard way; you don't want screen readers to have separate implementations for GTK, Qt, St, Firefox, etc. For every window, regardless of toolkit, you want to have a "list children" method. For every widget you want "get accessible name", so for a button it may tell you "OK button", and for an image it may tell you "thumbnail of file.jpg". For widgets that you can interact with, you want "list actions" and "run action X", so a button may present an "activate" action, and a check button may present a "toggle" action.

However, ATK is just abstract interfaces for the benefit of toolkits. We need a way to ship the information extracted from toolkits to assistive tech like screen readers. The atspi protocol is a set of DBus interfaces that an application must implement; atk-adaptor is an implementation of those DBus interfaces that works by calling atk's slightly different interfaces, which in turn are implemented by toolkits. Atk-adaptor also caches some things that it already asked to the toolkit, so it doesn't have to ask again unless the toolkit notifies about a change.

Does this seem like too much translation going on? It is! We will see the reasons behind that when we talk about how accessibility was implemented many years ago in GNOME.]]></summary>

It has a cleaner/smaller codebase since Xorg is so old
 The X11 specification is too large, too many features that aren't being used often
 It's more secure and prevents keylogging
  
I want to address each one separately.
 To start off, the first 2 arguments are basically the same thing. Xorg has more features and as a result it has more code, whereas Wayland gives applications a pixmap to draw whatever they want however they want, and thus saves the code that would be needed to draw lines and arcs and rectangles and such that Xorg offers. This isn't a feature. The point of making a smaller codebase is so that it's easier to add more features, but Wayland has no intention of doing that and so it becomes almos…]]></summary>

龙芯之前基于 MIPS 指令，去年开始推自研的 “龙芯架构” 指令集，号称 100% 自主。龙芯公司日前称，公司创立之初就认识到基于 x86 或者 ARM 不能建立自主体系，而 MIPS 指令系统相对比较开放。但 2019 年 MIPS 开源后又闭源的事件，公司认识到基于 MIPS 也无法建立自主生态。而对于最近几年很受欢迎的 RISC-V 开源指令集，龙芯认为基于 RISC-V 同样不能构建自主生态体系，RISC-V 架构指令条数较少，比较适合学术研究以及物联网应用，商业应用会需要增加更多的指令，因此龙芯坚持自主研发指令集。

老王点评：我坚持认为 RISC-V 开源指令集才是未来。




单核计算机一小时破解了一种抗量子加密算法

美国国家标准技术局（NIST）最近宣布了后量子加密和签名算法竞赛的首批获胜者。一种名为 SIKE 抗量子加密候选算法曾进入了第四轮评选，它是一种基于 Isogeny 的算法。鲁汶大学的一个团队发表论文称，他们在一台单核计算机上耗时一个小时获取了 SIKE 使用的加密密钥。SIKE 算法的发明人承认这出乎意料。


消息来源：ARS Technica



老王点评：在量子计算还没有真正实用之前就妄想创造抗量子计算的算法，我觉得有些有些想的简单了。谁能肯定量子计算机就只能做到我们目前以为的那些事情呢，就像计算机刚刚发明之初，谁能想到如今整个世界都跑在计算机之上呢。




Fedora 37 正式支持树莓派 4

Fedora 工程和指导委员会已经确认了对树莓派 4 的“官方”支持。之前，树莓派 4 没有成为 Fedora 工作站的重点，是因为各种补丁没有被上游化，比如开源 3D 图形驱动没有上游化到内核中。现在，虽然这些上游化的工作还在进行中，但 Fedora 37 将可以提供对树莓派 4B 以及树莓派 400 和 CM4 计算模块的支持。


消息来源：Phoronix



老王点评：之前 Pop!_OS 22.04 已经为树莓派 4 提供了支持，而 Fedora 37 也紧随其后，这都是这些驱动进入了上游后的成果，所以，真正推动 Linux 发展的的引擎，还是 Linux 内核啊。]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[战争对于民众而言是残酷的，大部分民众都不愿意身处战场，作为普通老百姓，无法上前线，但自身也应该了解一些关键的知识，以免自己的家庭在战争中遭受灭顶之灾，那么普通的老百姓在大规模战争期间，应该如何应对呢？今天我们就来聊一聊这个话题。


　　普通百姓的话，不同的人有不同的应对方法。这里按照可投资资产的数量进行一些划分。可投资资产，指的是存款、股票、基金、债券、房产等，剔除自住性房地产和流动性较差的资产。


　　一旦发生大规模战争，必然会导致大部分可投资资产大幅贬值，但粮食和石油的价格却会大幅上涨。很多投资人会因此血本无归，即使是普通老百姓，也会因为通胀而财富缩水，通常只有极少数人会在战争中受益。


　　1、对于有条件移民的人来说，战前把所有资产和家庭成员转移到第三方中立国是最佳方法，俗话说的好，“君子不立危墙之下”，意思就是，君子要远离危险的地方。尽量避开可能发生战争的地方，去相对安全的地区生活。这样可以一劳永逸解决战争可能带来的大部分风险。


　　2、对于没条件移民的人来说，如果拥有较多可投资资产，战前应该大量抛售手中的高风险资产，例如股票、基金、房产等，由于现金将会不断贬值，尽可能提前购买常用的保值品，将现金兑换为等价的保值品。比如将现金兑换成黄金或者外币，以对抗即将发生的大规模通货膨胀。


　　3、如果没多少可投资资产，也要提前购买大量可能上涨的商品，例如粮食、药品、日用品等，屯积1-5年左右的粮食、药品、日用品等，要知道，在大规模战争里，平民大多数死亡都是因为缺少食物和药品。


　　至于具体该如何屯积粮食、药品、日用品，可参见《屯粮储备手册》一文。


　　在家里存放适当的武器，主要是为了保命。战争期间，社会秩序可能会崩溃，很可能会遇到暴徒上门打劫，因此家里准备一些防身武器，例如匕首、长刀、短棍、弓箭等，遇到暴徒突然来袭，可以用武器抵挡，在必要时可以救自己的一命。适当的防身武器是很有必要的，毕竟在战争的大环境下，严重缺乏的是安全感。


　　最后小结


　　如果真的遇上战争，想办法保命和及时逃生最重要。在等待救援时，首先要确保自己的安全，在家里备用一定量的水和食物是很有必要的。


　　不管怎么说，希望战争远离民众，民众需要生活在和平的大环境下安居乐业，也希望世界上没有硝烟，只有祥和的普通生活。]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[在这份指南中，我们将看到 Dockerfile 的简要介绍以及如何在 Linux 中使用 Dockerfile 来自动的 创建自定义 Docker 镜像 。

什么是 Dockerfile ？

Dockerfile 是附有构建 Docker 镜像说明的易于理解的文本文件。它囊括了用户在创建镜像时可以调用的所有命令。

我们可以使用 Dockerfile 创建自定义的镜像。可以通过 Docker Hub 分享的自定义 Docker 镜像。

如果你还不知道，Docker Hub 是 Docker 提供的托管存储库服务，用于团队查找和共享容器镜像，当然世界上任何人也都可以访问。

想象一下，早期如果我们想用 Nginx，我们要通过很多步骤，才能安装和配置好 Nginx 。得益于 Docker Hub ，现在我们可以在几分钟内，下载并运行 Nginx 的预置容器镜像。



运行如下命令从 Docker Hub 上拉取 Nginx 镜像：

# docker pull nginx


一旦我们拉取了 Docker 镜像，可以运行如下命令使用它：

# docker run -it -d -p 8080:8080 nginx


就这样，十分简单！

参考下方链接，了解更多使用 Docker 的方式：


开始使用 Docker


Docker Hub 上有超过十万个来自软件供应商、开源项目以及社区的容器镜像。

你可以从 Docker Hub 上下载你选择的镜像，并且使用上面的命令开始使用它。

理解 Dockerfile 格式

Docker 可以读取 Dockerfile 中的 指令 来自动的创建镜像。

典型的 Dockerfile 包含如下指令：

1、FROM —— 这会设置容器的基础镜像。

例如：

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[如何 在命令行中更新你的 Ubuntu 系统？你可以使用 apt update（刷新包缓存）和 apt upgrade 命令。

sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade


它会更新所有可以立即升级的已安装 apt 包。这也包括 Linux 内核版本。

这似乎是一件好事，尤其是对于桌面用户。但对于运行关键 Web 服务的 Ubuntu 服务器用户而言，情况可能并非如此。

如果你想对更新有选择性，并且只想升级单个软件包，请使用以下命令：

sudo apt install --only-upgrade package_name


让我们更详细地了解一下。

使用 apt 命令升级单个包

第一步是更新本地包仓库缓存，以便你的系统知道有新版本的软件包可用。

sudo apt update


这是可选的。查看一下你要升级的软件包是否在 可升级软件包列表 中。

apt list --upgradable


如果所需的软件包有可用的新版本，你可以选择使用以下命令仅升级该单个软件包：

sudo apt install --only-upgrade package_name


如果你对已安装的软件包运行 apt install 命令，它将升级到下一个可用版本。

但如果该软件包尚未安装，apt 命令也会安装它。

这就是为什么 --only-upgrade 部分是必要的。使用该选项，apt 命令只会升级已安装的软件包。如果尚未安装，它将不会安装该软件包。

这不是最适合 Ubuntu 服务器用户的示例，但你仍然可以在下面的截图中看到我如何只升级了七个可升级包中的一个。



仅升级选定的软件包

如果要升级选定的几个软件包，那么不必一一更新。只需使用前面提到的命令提供包名称。

sudo apt install --only-upgrade package1 package2 package3


这是一个例子。



总结

当你面临必须升级选定软件包的情况时，你可以使用带有 –only-upgrade 选项的 apt install 命令。

我建议阅读 如何更有效地使用 apt 命令。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[我们总结了 Linux Mint 21 “Vanessa” 的 10 大特色，你可以看看有哪些是为你而准备的。




Linux Mint 21 “Vanessa” 是 Linux Mint 的第 36 个发布版本，它带来了一系列特色，以及对桌面上的有用改善。这些特色散落在 Cinnamon 桌面、内核变化、Xapps 更新等处。

我在这份 Linux Mint 21 的重要特色列表对它们做了个总结。

Linux Mint 21 “Vanessa” 的重要特色



1、Ubuntu 22.04 及其相关更新

也许最重要的变化就是 Linux Mint 21 的基础了，它现在基于 Ubuntu 22.04 “Jammy Jellyfish” 。上一次的主要版本，即 Linux Mint 20 “Ulyana” ，是基于四年前发布的 Ubuntu 20.04 “Focal Fossa” 。沧海桑田，现在与 2020 年的世界已然完全不同。

因此，大量的软件包、版本升级、新的性能改善 —— 所有的这些底层更新都来到了 Linux Mint 21 。这包括最新的长期支持的 Linux 内核 5.15 ，这带来了更多硬件系列的支持、以及针对编程、开发和网络的工具链的更新。

2、Timeshift 备份工具的重大变化

几个月前，Mint 开发团队 宣布 ：他们将接管著名的备份工具 Timeshift，并将其作为一个 “XApps” 继续开发。这是一个重大变化。你可能会问为什么？

好吧，Timeshift 工具的开发者 Tony George 正忙于其它的项目。你可能听说过 Linux 的 “TeeJeeTech” 应用。它是由 Tony 创建的，并且有一些很酷的应用。因此，他没有足够多的时间来专注于 Timeshift 的开发和改进。

钱穆治学“主通不主别”，标榜“求为一专家，不如求为一通人”，而在他批评“务为专家，惟求西化”之列的傅斯年，实颇具一种“通人”气象。蒋廷黻便说，傅斯年论政之作，篇篇都“好像集合了四千年的历史经验”。的确，言有所本而眼光通达，是傅氏言论的一大特色，但在具体研究中，他似更重视史事的横向关联，多次强调史事与周围的联系超过其与既往的联系，以为“古代方术家与他们同时的事物关系，未必不比他们和宋儒的关系更密；转来说，宋儒和他们同时事物之关系，未必不比他们和古代儒家之关系更密”（罗志田：《语语四千年：傅斯年眼中的中国通史》）。在钱穆记忆中，北伐后暗中操控北大历史系的傅斯年主张“先治断代史，不主张讲通史”，两人为此颇有些冲突。傅斯年本人对中国古代史研究造诣最深，以“文明多元起源论”重建上古史谱系的学术贡献为人称道。他所领导的中研院史语所成立了历史学、语言学、考古学三个研究组，发掘新问题，搜集新材料，使用新工具，一秉“旧域维新”宗旨，所处理的“汉地之历史语言材料”尚未及一般意义的“近代史”范畴。
傅斯年（1896-1950）
从学术建制角度看，同在中研院体制内，历史语言研究所与社会科学研究所似有某种分工的默契。1943年1月，傅斯年致函时任中研院院长朱家骅，内称：

原来在北平时，弟感觉社会所之亦治史学也，曾与孟和商量，二人同意如下：近一百年史，即鸦片战争起，由社会所办，其设备亦由社会所。明清两代经济史，以其经济方面，或比史之方面为重，归社会所。明清以前者，以其史学方面比经济方面为重，归史语所。敝所全照此办，故全汉升君昔有志治近代一问题，弟阻止之，而近百年之史事书籍，敝所遂未购置大略。弟近拟作一文，所中求《曾文正公家书》、《张文襄全集》亦不可得！而社会所似亦未为近百年史设备也。（《傅斯年遗札》第三卷，13…]]></summary>

《毫无意义的工作》，大卫·格雷伯著，吕宇珺译，中信出版社，2022年7月版，408页，79.00元
著名人类学家、无政府主义者大卫·格雷伯（David Graeber，1961-2020）的《毫无意义的工作》（原书名Bullshit Jobs: A Theory，2018；吕宇珺译，中信出版社，2022年7月）是一部精准对焦、单刀直入的书，也是一部视野开阔、视角多元的书。这是一部很应景、很接地气、很感性甚至很有情绪的书，也是一部蕴含有丰富理论资源和跨越时代与地域的深度思考的书。这是能帮助你洞悉生活真相的书，也是会让你面对更多困惑与质疑的书。无论读过还是没读过，只要你还在“工作”，这部书就都在那里，期待与你对话；无论你在“工作”中是奋发还是躺平，这部书都会让你思考为什么要奋发、为什么会躺平；无论你对自己的工作很满意还是很不满意，这部书总会迫使你重新思考你的满意或不满意。由于这个世界上有了越来越多“毫无意义的工作”——也就是“狗屁工作”（Bullshit Jobs）——读这部书的理由就越来越充分。或许我们难以摆脱“毫无意义的工作”，但是我们总应该知道为什么会这样，应该知道为什么难以摆脱，以及我们还能有什么更好的选择。总之，这是一部关于“毫无意义的工作”的很有意义、很能让读者产生阅读兴趣的书。如果从该书有可能产生的最重要的实际效果来看，所有公私机构的决策人和管理者最应该读这本书；这本书首先应该放置的地方不是图书馆或学者的书房，而是公私机构的大堂和管理者的案头，以及所有人才招聘会的会场里。当然，不难想象的是有些人会如何害怕和反对这本书。爱恨兼收，这似乎是很多无政府主义者的现实批判著作的共同命运。

大卫·格雷伯在序言“40%的工作毫无意义”中讲述了该书的缘起。甚至可以说，如果有读者想最快速地掌握该书的核心内容和影响，读完…]]></summary>

 Briefly -- I'm pivoting back into IT after a 15 year absence. Primarily a macOS user (since early 90s). But back in the day I enjoyed failing at spinning up LAMP servers, figuring out what I did wrong and then getting them to work. Same with SQL and other light admin stuff. I'm currently back in IT in an official capacity and getting my sea legs back (Windows).
 Mid term plan is to get certs and start looking into junior admin stuff that could possibly lead to <fill in blank>. I've taken a few passes at Python as well and it sits right in my fun zone so would enjoy adding that to my repertoire.
 I'm leaning toward REHL, so am I overthinking this for choosing a daily driver distro to start ramping up my linux skills? Considering Rocky, Alma or Fedora but I'm wondering if it even matters while I have my training wheels on.
 Am I overthinking this? Should I just grab a distro, load onto my Macbook Pro and give it a whack? I have an additional (older) MBP and a current Dell Latitude i7 if I want to get frisky and try Arch or change midstream.
 In the end I'm not sweating this too much because even if this leads to no career change I love tinkering and growing tired of the Win/Mac plantations. Thanks for any input.

 So this:
 echo 'hey="hi" test="hi" test="hi"' | sed '/^test=/s/"$/ hello"/' 
 Produces:
 hey="hi" test="hi hello" test="hi hello" 
 I have no idea how I would name such a feature, let alone a term I could use to search for it on the web or documentation.
 So, what are your interesting and hard to find features of tools, which you have no idea how they are named or what term you could use to search for it?
 Also, in case you want to know how it's named in sed's manual page: It's called "Addresses".

We have worked at the full gamut of companies ranging from startups to big tech and have gotten the sense that many of the rote aspects of software development could be made easier, freeing up precious mental energy.
Devs love Copilot, but autocomplete is just one of many ways that AI should make programming easier. We’re taking a more comprehensive approach to developer tooling that bundles Copilot-like autocomplete with documentation, custom AI instruction, and some early refactoring capabilities (Python only) in one extension.

固态硬盘的耗电量远低于硬盘，但一项新的研究意外地显示，它们的终生碳足迹要比硬盘高得多。研究人员测量了固态硬盘和硬盘在整个生命周期中每 GB 的碳足迹，他们发现，虽然固态硬盘在使用过程中的碳排放低于硬盘，但在制造过程中的碳密度要远高于硬盘。每制造一个 1TB 的固态硬盘会排放相当于 320 公斤的二氧化碳。相比之下，同等容量的硬盘只排放 40 公斤。而综合使用过程的碳排放，1 TB 的固态硬盘的终生碳足迹是 369.2 公斤二氧化碳，而硬盘是 199 公斤。另外，一台台式电脑的碳足迹几乎有 40% 来自固态硬盘，而 CPU 只占 4%，GPU 占 11%。

老王点评：固态硬盘就和新能源车一样，有些水面下的成本是你看不到的。




树莓派 4 增加对 3D API 的支持

树莓派基金会宣布，树莓派 4 符合 Vulkan 1.2 标准。树莓派的现在的桌面图形是由 OpenGL 驱动的，Vulkan 要取代的是旧的图形 API。该 API 可以为开发者提供与 2019 年英伟达显卡、2020 年英特尔集成显卡芯片和其他几十种设备相同的 3D 图形能力。对于大多数将树莓派用作服务器、DIY 控制器或轻型桌面的人来说，对 Vulkan 1.2 的支持并不重要。但是对游戏和 3D 应用来说应该会受益。

老王点评：虽然我想不出用树莓派玩 3D 游戏是什么体验，但是或许有比玩游戏更有趣的场景。




Winamp 5.9 释出首个 RC 版本

去年底，我们曾经报道过 Winamp 准备重启。现在，这个曾经最流行的音乐播放器 Winamp 释出了 Winamp 5.9 RC1。开发者称，对终端用户来说，Winamp 5.9 RC1 可能变化不大，但底层代码库进行了重大重构。在基础工作完成之后，他们将可以开始给软件修复和增添功能。


消息来源：Winamp

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[GNOME 正计划通知用户其固件安全状态，来保护不安全的硬件。




当你在支持 UEFI 的电脑上安装 Linux 时，你必须禁用“安全启动Secure Boot”，因为启用该选项后，不能使用现场 USBLive USB 启动。

一些主流的 Linux 发行版支持安全启动，但对于许多其他发行版（以及板载的 Nvidia 硬件）来说，它的设置仍然具有挑战性。

虽然一年又一年，情况似乎并没有改善，但总的来说，安全启动是一个必不可少的保护功能。

因此，正如 Phoronix 所发现的，为了方便和让用户意识到这一点，GNOME 和红帽的开发者正在努力在安全启动被禁用时通知（或警告）用户。

它有什么用？

UEFI/安全启动被批评为 DRM，因为它剥夺了用户的自由。开源社区的许多人仍然不赞同实施 UEFI/安全启动和 TPM，因为它带来了不便。这就催生了像 Coreboot 这样的项目在开源世界中蓬勃发展。

当然，如果你每天都用 Linux，我会建议你购买支持 Coreboot 的新硬件，这是一个不同的故事。

话虽如此，但可以肯定的是，安全启动是最简单的方法。

考虑到捆绑的专有固件，安全启动的安全性仍然值得商榷。但是，它是一个确保系统的固件安全的基本保护机制。

所以，开发者准备在启动闪屏（Plymouth）、GNOME 显示管理器（GDM）和 GNOME 控制中心显示警告。



GNOME 的一位开发者在 博客文章 中分享了它的更多细节，同时给出了其中的一些屏幕截图。



一位来自红帽的开发者在 合并请求 中提到。


安全启动被用来对付一些恶意软件试图感染系统的固件的安全威胁。用户可能会无意中禁用或软件可能会有意禁用安全启动。因此，配置不正确的话，系统就运行在一个不安全的平台上。如果启动闪屏能向用户提供一个警告，用户可以重新启动并重新配置他们的系统，或者立即寻求帮助。


所以，作为一个 GNOME 用户，当它进入 GNOME 43 的最终版本或任何未来的版本时，我乐于看到它所带来的变化。

如果你也想看看，你可以在 GNOME 控制中心的“隐私Privacy”标签下的“设备安全Device Security”部分找到这个选项，如下图所示，我的机器在 Arch Linux 上运行 GNOME 43 alpha。



该菜单还可以显示 TPM、英特尔 BootGuard 和 IOMMU 保护的细节。



看来我的系统并不像我想象的那么安全……但也许这就是这个功能的意义所在？

如果你只在你的 Linux 发行版上使用 UEFI 模式，并且为了方便而关闭了安全保护功能，这能让你意识到这一点吗？

有可能。但是，看看 Linux 发行版的状况和启用安全启动的问题。我不觉得这可能会是一个大问题。我们很快就会知道了。

如何禁用这个警告？

正如在 GNOME Gitlab 的 合并请求 中提到的，在你的内核参数中添加 sb-check=false 就可以禁用这些警告。

不过，作为终端用户，你不需要担心这个问题。

你对即将在 GNOME 43 或更高版本中增加的这个功能有什么看法？你对 UEFI/安全启动有什么看法？

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[我喜欢使用本地 SMTP 守护进程从我的笔记本电脑发送电子邮件，因为这样我即使在断开连接的情况下也可以发送电子邮件，而且，即使是在网络正常的情况下，因为我不需要等待网络协议在远程 smarthost 上完成。哦，我还需要本地邮件投递。

多年来，我一直使用 Postfix 来达到这些目的。它具有可接受的简单配置。但最近我开始喜欢 VPN（mullvad，如果你想知道的话），而在 /etc/resolv.conf 发生变化时会变得混乱（例如，你在 Postfix 的服务启动后才启动 VPN）。我找到了一个非常简单的替代方案：OpenSMTPD。

假设我想在使用 jao@gnu.org 发送电子邮件时使用 SMTP 服务器 fencepost.gnu.org，而在我的 From 头中使用 mail@jao.io 或 news@xmobar.org 时使用 smtp.jao.io。OpenSMTPD 让你通过一个非常简单的配置文件 /etc/smtpd.conf 来实现：

（这是我的 Debian 机器中的默认配置文件。另一个流行的替代方案是 /etc/openstmpd.conf）。

table aliases file:/etc/aliases
table secrets db:/etc/mail/secrets.db

table sendergnu { jao@gnu.org }
table senderjao { mail@jao.io, news@xmobar.org }

listen on localhost

action "local" mbox alias <aliases>
action "relaygnu" relay host smtp+tls://gnu@fencepost.gnu.org:587 auth <secrets>
action "relayjao" relay host smtps://jao@smtp.jao.io:465 auth <secrets>

match for local action "local"
match for any from mail-from <sendergnu> action "relaygnu"
match for any from mail-from <senderjao> action "relaygan"


我们还为此配置了本地投递。这是完整的配置文件！唯一需要的另一件事是生成 secrets.db 文件，其中包含与键 gnu 和 jao 对应的用户和密码（这些只是任意名称）。为此，我们使用它们创建一个纯文本文件，使用形式为 <key> <user>:<password> 的条目：

gnu  jao:my fencepost password
jao  mail@jao.io:xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx


fencepost.gnu.org 用户是 jao，smtp.jao.io 的用户是 mail@jao.io（你看，不需要转义空格或 ats）。然后我们使用程序 makemap 来创建密钥数据库：

makemap secrets && rm secrets

 来源：澎湃新闻
                
很多人都知道《魔戒》的作者托尔金和《纳尼亚传奇》的作者C.S.刘易斯，不少人也知道他们有过一段深厚又传奇的友谊，而讲述他们的友谊则是一件简单却又困难的事情。

简单，是因为仅仅用几句话就能概括其历程：1926年，他们相识；1929年，托尔金拿出《精灵宝钻》手稿与刘易斯分享，两人开始深交；1931年，与托尔金一番谈话后，刘易斯重新皈依基督教；1930年代，围绕他们形成了“墨象社”（Inklings）这个文学团体，托尔金在聚会上读了《魔戒》。他们打了一次赌，催生出刘易斯的“空间三部曲”和托尔金未完成的“失落之路”。但后来托尔金开始疏远刘易斯，严词批评《纳尼亚传奇》，对刘易斯的朋友和后来的妻子很有意见，而刘易斯却还在1961年提名托尔金为诺贝尔文学奖候选人。1963年刘易斯去世，这段友情告终。
刘易斯提名托尔金《魔戒》的信件，来自《C.S.路易斯：天赋奇才，勉为先知》（[英]麦格拉思著，苏欲晓、傅燕晖译，上海三联书店2018年5月版）
为什么托尔金的态度会急转直下？背后到底发生了什么？这些问题怎么都说不清，可能永远也找不到答案。颇为权威、也颇有名气的传记作家汉弗莱·卡彭特（Humphrey Carpenter）提供了一些线索，但有点主观，他刻意放大了托尔金与刘易斯乃至与他们的共同好友查尔斯·威廉斯（Charles Williams）有嫌隙的一面，渲染托尔金的嫉妒情绪，似乎这一切都是托尔金小心眼所致。刘易斯对个中原因也是丈二和尚摸不着头脑。至于托尔金本人的话，也不能百分之百相信，因为存在许多前后矛盾的地方。托尔金说自己无法认同《纳尼亚传奇》这样的书，但为什么又把这套书送给心爱的孙女看？他说自己讨厌《纳尼亚传奇》中的寓言，但他写的《尼葛的叶子》（Leaf by Niggle）不就是寓言吗？他说很遗憾刘易斯没皈依天主教、皈依了…]]></summary>

　　此举是在COVID-19的高传播性BA.5变体激增的情况下进行的。本周早些时候，湾区交通系统BART恢复了其口罩任务。


　　苹果公司在4月开始要求一些员工返回办公室，但没有实施其完整的混合模式，即要求所有员工每周有3天的亲自工作。

　　苹果团队：


　　我们写这封信是为了分享我们目前协议的更新。鉴于目前的情况，在大多数地方将不再要求佩戴面罩。像往常一样，请定期检查Welcome Forward，了解您所在地区的具体要求，包括当地卫生部门的要求，或您可能访问的任何地点。


　　我们认识到，每个人的个人情况都不同。如果您觉得这样做更舒服，请不要犹豫，继续佩戴口罩。另外，请尊重每个人戴不戴口罩的决定。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[IPv4 addresses are, as we all know, 32-bit numbers, done in four byte-long chunks, e.g., 127.0.0.1. But there are some silly things you can do with that -- the TCP/IP stack is, apparently, kinda savvy that way. So, for example:
 ping -c 127.0.0.1 PING 127.0.0.1 (127.0.0.1) 56(84) bytes of data. 64 bytes from 127.0.0.1: icmp_seq=1 ttl=64 time=0.038 ms 
 Well, okay, nothing special there. But let's think about what "127.0.0.1" means to the computer -- that's a "1" in the ones column, a zero in the 256's column, a zero in the 65,536's column, and a 127 in the 16,777,216's column, or... 2130706433, in decimal. Hmmm, I wonder...
 ping -c1 2130706433 PING 2130706433 (127.0.0.1) 56(84) bytes of data. 64 bytes from 127.0.0.1: icmp_seq=1 ttl=64 time=0.037 ms 
 Well, lookee there! That's one pretty smart stack! What about hex?
 ping -c1 0x7F000001 PING 0x7F000001 (127.0.0.1) 56(84) bytes of data. 64 bytes from 127.0.0.1: icmp_seq=1 ttl=64 time=0.038 ms 
 Dotted-quad hex?
 ping -c1 0x7f.0.0.1 PING 0x7f.0.0.1 (127.0.0.1) 56(84) bytes of data. 64 bytes from 127.0.0.1: icmp_seq=1 ttl=64 time=0.055 ms 
 Octal?
 ping -c1 017700000001 PING 017700000001 (127.0.0.1) 56(84) bytes of data. 64 bytes from 127.0.0.1: icmp_seq=1 ttl=64 time=0.052 ms 
 Binary?! Well, no -- apparently, it does fall down on binary. But still, it's a fun glimpse into how Linux, and the stack, think about IP addresses. 
 EDIT: because of this post, I did some digging, and found out that this behavior is apparently part of a 2001 POSIX spec, and is nicely documented here: https://linux.die.net/man/3/inet_aton

longtime GNOME contributor—and a cruciverbalist
for longer still—thought it was time for GNOME to have a
crossword puzzle
application.  So he set out to create one, which turned 
into something of a yak-shaving exercise,
but also, ultimately, into Crosswords.  Blandford
came to GUADEC 2022

 Hello everyone! I'm an Arch user who uses it on my every computer, and thanks to my exposure to Linux and OpenBSD, I've been very in love with software, especially free and minimal software! I was a finance student, but now I work as a Go backend developer for a Web3 product for almost 1 year.
 If you are anything like me, then you'd partition the hell out of your disks!
 And there's always one annoyance that comes with partitioning if you are obssessed with order - that is, ugly partition table!

深度操作系统预计在本月发布新的 Deepin 23 操作系统，其中将采用一种新的独立软件包格式：玲珑。 深度社区称玲珑是“统信软件自研的开源软件包格式，用于与 dpkg、rpm 等包管理系统共同实现应用包管理、分发、沙箱、集成开发工具等功能。”根据披露的特性，玲珑软件包可运行在任意 Linux 桌面环境中，运行在独立的沙箱环境，支持应用增量更新。


消息来源：深度



老王点评：看来是一种容器式软件包。确实，要打造一个“根操作系统”，是应该有个独立的软件包体系才名正言顺，但是应该有真正的软件包方面的创新才有意义。据我所知，这是国内这批“根操作系统”中第一个提出自己的软件包格式的操作系统。让我们拭目以待这个玲珑之后的进一步信息。




英特尔将在 2024 年推出 Wi-Fi 7

因为苹果正在将其设备过渡到 Wi-Fi 6E，英特尔正计划在 2024 年之前在设备中安装其下一代 Wi-Fi 7（802.11be）技术。Wi-Fi 7 是 Wi-Fi 6E（802.11ax）的继任者，带来了两倍于 5.8Gbps 的数据处理速度和更稳定的 6GHz 带宽稳定性，在处理数据时支持高达 36Gbps 带宽。苹果还没有发布任何支持 Wi-Fi 6E 的设备，有望在今年从 iPhone 14 开始支持。


消息来源：MacRumors

世界上最大的教科书出版商之一培生公司的 CEO 说，他希望像 NFT 和区块链这样的技术可以帮助该公司从电子书的二手销售中分得一杯羹，因为越来越多的书籍以电子书形式销售。纸质书籍，尤其是昂贵的教科书，有时候会转售七次之多，但转售不会出版商带来任何收益。而随着教科书转向数字化，教科书出版商看到了从转售中获利的可能。

老王点评：纸质书转售对出版商没好处是因为出版商第一次就收到了足够的钱。而电子书却给出版商带来机会，让出版商有望控制电子书的二次流通，并通过它再次获利。]]></summary>

《庾信诗赋选》，[北周]庾信著，谭正璧、纪馥华选注，古典文学出版社，1958年2月出版，199页，0.65元
陶渊明《读山海经（精卫衔微木）》一首中，关于“刑天舞干戚”句，颇有争议，大多都集中在该句的异文之上，因其较早版本作“形夭无千岁”，然于义未安，宋人则据《山海经》校作“刑天舞干戚”，认为是用了《山海经》“刑天与帝争神，帝断其首，葬之常羊之山。乃以乳为目，以脐为口，操干戚以舞”的典故，意思较为明确，也符合《读山海经》的题目。这在洪迈的《容斋随笔》、周必大的《二老堂诗话》等书中都有所提及。此后，或主古本，或从意思，聚讼纷纷，莫衷一是。但“刑天舞干戚”的版本，因其意义显豁，终究还是略胜一筹，不少陶诗注本，尤其是普及类读本都选择了“刑天舞干戚”这一版本的异文。

至于“刑天舞干戚”的意思，则无甚争议，各注本的注解也都差不多，几无异辞：即用《山海经》中典故，刑天在与黄帝的争斗中失败，被砍去头颅，以乳房与肚脐为眼口，依然舞动着干戚——一般的注释都解释作盾牌与斧子——以示依旧保持着战斗意志，比如龚斌先生的《陶渊明集校笺》就说：“刑天虽无首，犹舞干戚以斗。”一些后世流传的神话故事里，刑天也被描绘为无首但却依旧挥舞着斧与盾与黄帝争斗的斗士。

然而，“干戚”一词，被解释为单纯的盾牌、斧子之类的武器，却并非是毫无瑕疵，无懈可击的。《礼记·乐记》：“干戚之舞，非备乐也。”《明堂位》：“朱干玉戚,冕而舞《大武》。”郑注：“朱干，赤大盾也；戚，斧也；冕，冠名也。《大武》，周舞也。”又《文王世子》：“大乐正学舞干戚。”孙希旦集解：“干戚，《大武》之舞也。”由此可知，周代乐舞中，有一种《大武》舞，舞者即执干戚，其中的“干戚”是“朱干玉戚”，即作为舞具，象征性的盾与斧。照此解释，刑天之“舞干戚”，并非是真正拿着武器战斗了。

但《礼记》中各…]]></summary>

 Old figures I found online, which are from 2011, and when the Linux kernel was under 10 million lines of code. Whereas it's at about 30 million today.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[学习为什么 Python 中的可观测性很重要，以及如何在你的软件开发生命周期中实现它。




你写的应用会执行很多代码，而且是以一种基本上看不到的方式执行。所以你是怎么知道：


代码是否在运行？

是不是在正常工作？

谁在使用它，如何使用？


可观测性是一种能力，可以通过查看数据来告诉你，你的代码在做什么。在这篇文章中，主要关注的问题是分布式系统中的服务器代码。并不是说客户端应用代码的可观测性不重要，只是说客户端往往不是用 Python 写的。也不是说可观测性对数据科学不重要，而是在数据科学领域的可观测性工具（大多是 Juptyter 和快速反馈）是不同的。

为什么可观测性很重要

所以，为什么可观测性重要呢？在软件开发生命周期（SDLC）中，可观测性是一个关键的部分。

交付一个应用不是结束，这只是一个新周期的开始。在这个周期中，第一个阶段是确认这个新版本运行正常。否则的话，很有可能需要回滚。哪些功能正常运行？哪些功能有细微的错误？你需要知道发生了什么，才能知道接下来要怎么做。这些东西有时候会以奇怪的方式不能正常运行。不管是天灾，还是底层基础设施的问题，或者应用进入了一种奇怪的状态，这些东西可能在任何时间以任何理由停止工作。

在标准 SDLC 之外，你需要知道一切都在运行中。如果没有，有办法知道是怎么不能运行的，这是非常关键的。

反馈

可观测性的第一部分是获得反馈。当代码给出它正在做什么的信息时，反馈可以在很多方面提供帮助。在模拟环境或测试环境中，反馈有助于发现问题，更重要的是，以更快的方式对它们进行分类。这可以改善在验证步骤中的工具和交流。

当进行金丝雀部署canary deployment或更改特性标志时，你需要知道是否要继续，还是等更长时间，或者回滚，反馈就显得很重要了。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[AppFlowy 旨在成为 Notion 的开源替代品，为你提供更好的隐私保护。让我们了解一下它。


虽然项目管理/笔记工具 Notion 功能非常出色，但它并不是一个开源解决方案。此外，它没有 Linux 桌面客户端。

那么，对于 Linux 用户来说，更透明、更私密和可用的替代方案是什么？

这就是 AppFlowy 大放异彩的地方！

AppFlowy 使用 Rust 和 Flutter 构建，遵循极简原则，但提供了足够的调整空间。

AppFlowy 是隐私和用户体验的完美结合



AppFlowy 是相当新的。在它去年首次推出后，我们曾 报告 了它的发展状况。

这是一个开源项目，旨在克服 Notion 在安全和隐私方面的一些限制。它可以帮助你管理任务、添加待办事项列表、截止日期、跟踪事件、添加页面，以及为你的笔记/任务设置文本格式。

不仅仅是安全性。用户体验也很重要。而 AppFlowy 在这方面做得很好，甚至比 Notion 更好。

请注意，该项目仍处于 测试阶段。

目前，该项目的目标不是提供更好的设计和功能，而是数据隐私、原生体验和社区驱动。

Notion 与 AppFlowy，如何选择？

虽然它旨在作为取代 Notion 的开源解决方案，但它可能并不适合所有人。

因此，如果你要选择 AppFlowy 而不是 Notion，你将获得以下好处：

透明度

AppFlowy 是一个开源项目，因此你可以随时查看和修改代码。

隐私

作为闭源软件，Notion 可以直接访问你在云中的私有数据。与之相比，你可以根据自己的喜好自行托管 AppFlowy。

你的所有个人数据都将保留在你身边，你可以完全控制它。开发人员还提到他们正在使用离线模式来更好的支持本地安装。

性能和原生体验

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The idea behind both of these is to run commands one after another, but there is one subtle difference: ; will run the second command immediately after the first one returns, but && will only run the second one if and only if the first command returns 0 (success). Returning anything else or crashing will result in the second command not being run. Note that a line break (\n) is the same as using ; in Bash.
 Here's an example: Let's say you are cloning a Git repository, then installing the software. So the goal is to run git clone https://www.github.com/NateNate60/myrepo, then run cd myrepo, and then make and make install. Simple enough. A naive script:
 git clone https://www.github.com/NateNate60/myrepo cd myrepo make make install 
 ...or the one-liner:
 git clone https://www.github.com/NateNate60/myrepo; cd myrepo; make; make install 
 Both of these will usually work, but the second command onward is only valid if the git clone succeeds! Otherwise, ./myrepo will not exist, so cd will fail, and then the Bash will end up running make and make install on the current directory.
 Note that there is a double-whammy in the naive script; make install is only valid if make works! So if compilation fails, and the makefile is either misconfigured or worse, you could end up installing junk.
 So if you're smart and you know your stuff about Bash, you would instead write:
 git clone https://www.github.com/NateNate60/myrepo && \ cd myrepo && \ make && make install 
 ...or maybe you'd store the return value and intelligently report an error to the user :)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This was originally posted on r/Windows10, i've decided to repost it here just in case it can help anyone, so here's the original title:
 How do i move a 512 Mb Fat partition i have never created out of the way so i can enlarge another one?
 Body:
 Hello everyone, i'm sorry but today my computer decided that it wants to speak italian on it's own, so i will have to translate the following picture.
 I know, this community is for windows 10, but this problem was born with windows, even though the partition i want to expand is an ext4 linux file system (which i will enlarge in linux).
 Please keep in mind that i am talking about the 500 Gb ssd. The first partition is "System reserver", and uses 579 Mb formatted with NTFS. The second one is C:, The black empty space is space that i got out of c, E: is a weird partition that got created on its own, and i have absoloutely no idea of what that is for. There are no files in there, and i cant expand it or shrink it. I just want to move that black unallocated space close to the 112 Gb ext4 partition so i can enlarge it. What should i do? I am afraid that it's some kind of boot thing, even though i use MBR, not GPT! My dream would be freeing that MBR primary partition and absoloutely anhillating it. Can i do it?
 Once again, this is straight out of that post, I don't know if posting it here is appropriate but after having cried on this crappy partition i really feel in moral debt of explaining how to fix this.

The goal is to create a workspace, where people can manage their various priorities, both personal and professional, see a single schedule combined of all their calendars and manage their days without switching between multiple apps.
At the moment we've implemented Google calendar synchronisation, basic tasks and notes. Also Emery has some things we really wanted to see in other apps – private notes for meetings, categories that can be used to group tasks/notes/meetings together, weekly productivity reports.
Happy to hear any feedback and answer any questions!

 Rolling Rhino Remix 2022.08.01 ships with the 5.18.15 kernel by default. The initialisation tool has now been deprecated, with the disk images being built handling the tasks the rhino-init tool previously handled. All packages have also been upgraded to their latest version and there have been a number of small bug fixes.

I’m Stefan, one of the founders of Polymath Robotics (https://www.polymathrobotics.com) and formerly of Starsky Robotics (YC S16). My co-founder is Ilia Baranov, a career roboticist. We’re building general autonomy software for industrial vehicles.
We’ve just come out of stealth with a full autonomy stack freely available in sim online. Whether it’s a tractor on a farm or a 400t dump truck in a mine, we make it easy for you to make it driverless. Where before you would need an industrial vehicle, $25-150k in sensors + compute, and 6-18 months of building time, now you can start building applications that command autonomous robots right away.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[7月28日，谷歌母公司Alphabet旗下人工智能公司DeepMind公司与欧洲生物信息研究所（EMBL-EBI）的合作团队公布了生物学领域的一项重大飞跃。他们利用人工智能（AI）系统AlphaFold预测出超过100万个物种的2.14亿个蛋白质结构，几乎涵盖了地球上所有已知蛋白质。这一突破将加速新药开发，并为基础科学带来全新革命。


　　2020年年底，当人们对AlphaFold的印象还停留在那个打败全人类的围棋高手时，这个AI系统在生物学领域的亮相带来了新的惊喜。当时，AlphaFold成功破解了生物学持续50年的重大难题——蛋白质折叠问题，能够根据蛋白质的氨基酸序列预测蛋白质的三维结构。


　　仅仅半年后，DeepMind和EMBL-EBI合作，在一篇《自然》论文中发布了由AlphaFold预测的蛋白结构数据库。这个数据库涵盖了人类和20种常用模式生物的35万个蛋白质结构，并且对98.5%的人类蛋白质结构进行了准确预测——要知道在此之前，科学界解析的蛋白质结构只覆盖了人类蛋白序列17%的氨基酸。人工智能预测蛋白质结构领域的一系列突破，也被《科学》评选为2021年的年度科学突破。


　　现在，DeepMind与EMBL-EBI的合作团队更进一步。AlphaFold对蛋白质结构的预测不再局限于人类与模式生物，而是拓展至涵盖了动植物、细菌等的100万个物种，预测的蛋白质结构数量也提升了数百倍。


　　“这个数据库涵盖了整个蛋白质宇宙，我们迈入了数字生物学的全新时代。”DeepMind的首席执行官Demis Hassabis博士点评道。


　　早在1972年，诺贝尔化学奖得主Christian Anfinsen博士就在诺奖颁奖典礼上提出，蛋白质的氨基酸结构应该能完全决定其三维结构。但由于氨基酸可能形成的蛋白质构象是个天文数字，通过计算预测蛋白质结构难度极高。而利用传统的实验手段（例如X射线晶体学）解决该问题，时间消耗以及价格都十分惊人。


　　对于今日公布的全新数据，DeepMind与EMBL-EBI团队表示，在超过2亿个蛋白质结构预测中，大约35%的结构具有高精度，达到了实验手段获取的结构精度；80%的结构可靠性足以用于多项后续分析。


　　不过，目前的AlphaFold仍有提升的空间。伦敦大学学院的Tomek Wlodarski 博士提出，如何开发模型来预测蛋白质如何折叠，而不仅是预测最终的结构，是研究团队接下来要解决的问题。


　　DeepMind的科学团队主管Pushmeet Kohli博士也指出，现阶段他们正在提升AlphaFold的准确性与性能：“我们试图理解这些蛋白质的行为、它们如何与其他蛋白质互作。”


　　一年前的《自然》论文发表时，研究团队就向科研人员免费公开了AlphaFold的源代码以及数据库。目前，已有来自190个国家和地区的50多万位学者访问数据库。这些数据已经在疟疾疫苗开发、对抗抗生素耐药性与塑料污染等场景中得到应用，并且帮助研发人员加速新药研发。


　　此次，团队再次免费公开了最新的数据库，所有2亿多个蛋白质结构都能通过数据库下载。新药开发领域的专家表示，这一庞大的数据库能够让研究人员将更多的精力投入到确认蛋白结构的细节上面，这是很多靶向药物能否成功的关键。Exscientia公司的结构生物信息学副总监Chris Radoux博士在接受行业媒体Endpoints News采访时表示：“我们不再需要问‘蛋白结构在哪儿？’，而是去回答‘我们有的蛋白结构有多大用？’的问题。”他补充道：“这个数据库让我们能够扩展可以成药的基因组范围，大幅度增加了科学家们发现创新药物过程中拥有的选项。”


　　DeepMind的首席执行官Demis Hassabis博士表示，AlphaFold让我们一窥未来，看到将计算与AI技术应用于生物学的无限潜力。在最基本的层面，生物学可以被认为是一种信息处理系统，但是它非常复杂。AI技术可能成为解决生物学动态复杂性的关键。DeepMind的团队非常高兴地看到，AI的巨大潜力正在被实现，它有望成为人类科学发现和理解生命基本原理最有力工具之一。

Before watching the video I thought he might be using something like a Pinebook but it turn out he’s running Asahi on an Apple Silicon Mac. I fact checked and found this note by the man himself. 
 I researched a bit and found out he has used macbooks for kernel development before, so it’s not nothing new, but it’s still interesting for me to see him making this move, specially knowing that Asahi is not fully ready yet (I think). Anyways, what are your thoughts on this? Personally I would love to run Linux on an Apple Silicon Mac, it’s hardware it’s just unbelievably good for my liking.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Linus 在 Macbook 上发布了 Linux 内核 5.19

今天，Linus Torvalds 发布了 Linux 5.19，在对新硬件方面添加了对龙芯 CPU 和 Zen 4 CPU 的支持，支持 Zstd 压缩固件，并进一步改进了性能。有趣的是，Linux 表示，这次 5.19 的发布工作是在他的苹果 MacBook 笔记本上完成的，这台笔记本运行了 Asahi Linux 为苹果 M1 Macbook 打造的 Linux 系统。Linus 说，“这是我个人期待了很久的事情，而现在终于变成了现实。”在很早之前他曾在 PPC970 设备上为 PowerPC 进行过开发，这是他第三次使用苹果硬件用于 Linux 开发。他说，“但现阶段我并没有将 MacBook Air 用于任何真实工作，我只是将其用于版本测试、启动以及现在的版本发布。”


消息来源：Phoronix



老王点评：果然 Linus 对 Asahi Linux 的工作非常满意，我寻思我也是不是把我的 M1 Macbook 换成 Asahi Linux。




Linux 内核不过 520

被称为 Linux 5.20 的开发中的内核很可能会被称为 Linux 6.0。根据 Linus Torvalds 对现代版本的划分，Linux 又到了采用下一个主要版本号的时候。他对主要版本的提升通常会在小版本更新到 19 或 20 时进行。Linux 3.19 之后是 Linux 4.0，Linux 4.20 之后是 Linux 5.0。在周日的 Linux 5.19 公告中，Linus 表示“我可能会叫它 6.0，因为我开始担心再次被大数字所迷惑”。


消息来源：Phoronix



老王点评：Linux 内核的大版本号其实没什么特别的，就是一个进位而已，你就当成内核版本号采用的是 20 进制好了。有时候可能还忘记进位了。




Python 开发者讨论从邮件列表转移到论坛

Python 项目在 2018 年开始实验使用论坛交流，作为实验的一部分，Python 核心开发者使用的邮件列表 python-committers 切换到了 Discourse 论坛。今天该邮件列表仍然存在，但主要作为发布公告使用，大部分讨论都是在论坛上进行的。一位开发者称，他不怎么访问 Discourse 而错过了有兴趣的新 PEP 讨论，希望新 PEP 能发布在 python-dev 邮件列表上。这个提议引发了讨论。最终，Python 语言指导委员会表示要将讨论的媒介切换到 Discourse 论坛，Python 的邮件列表可能要全面转向论坛了。


消息来源：Solidot



老王点评：虽然确实很多老程序员都习惯了邮件列表，但是应该与时俱进，采用更丰富、更现代的交流方式。而同时保留老的交流方式，直到没什么人继续使用它，或因为缺乏重要功能而被废弃。]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[fmt 命令是一个简单的文本格式化程序。我将在这里展示如何使用它来格式化文本和邮件回复。


当我为项目编写文档时，我经常以纯文本的形式编写自述文件和安装说明。我不需要使用 HTML 或者 Markdown 之类的标记语言来描述项目的功能或如何编译它。但是维护这样的文档可能会很痛苦。如果我需要更新我的 Readme 文件中的一个句子的中间位置，我需要重新格式化文本，以避免在我的其它文本中间出现一个很长或很短的行，而其它的行的格式是整整齐齐的 75 列。一些编辑器包含可以自动重新格式化文本以填充段落的功能，但并非所有的编辑器都这样做。这就是 Linux fmt 命令的用武之地。

使用 Linux fmt 命令格式化文本

fmt 命令是一个简单的文本格式化程序；它收集单词并填充段落，但不应用任何其它文本样式，例如斜体或粗体。这一切都是纯文本。使用 fmt 命令，你可以快速调整文本，使其更易于阅读。让我们从这个熟悉的示例文本开始:

$ cat trek.txt 
Space: the final
frontier. These are the voyages
of the starship Enterprise. Its
continuing mission: to explore
strange new worlds. To
seek out new life and new
civilizations. To boldly go
where no one has gone before!


在这个实例文件中，每行都有不同的长度，并且它们以一种奇怪的方式换行。如果你对纯文本文件进行大量更改，你可以会遇到类似的奇怪的换行。要重新格式化此文本，你可以使用 fmt 命令将段落的行填充为统一长度：

$ fmt trek.txt 
Space:…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[从 .deb 文件安装应用 非常简单。双击它，它会在软件中心中打开，然后从那里安装它。

但是如何在 Ubuntu 或 Debian 中卸载 deb 包呢？如何删除一段时间前安装的软件包呢。

虽然这有几个如果和但是，但删除 .deb 文件的最简单和最可靠的方法是使用 apt remove 命令。

sudo apt remove program_name


如你所见，你需要在这里知道确切的包名称。这可能并不总是显而易见的。例如，如果你在 Ubuntu 上安装 Google Chrome，则该程序在命令行中称为 “google-chrome-stable”。你已经知道了吗？我猜你不知道。

在本教程中，我将详细介绍如何找到确切的包名称，然后使用它来删除应用。我还将讨论使用图形方法删除 deb 包。

从 Ubuntu 中删除通过 .deb 文件安装的软件包

在我向你展示如何从命令行删除 deb 包之前，让我们在软件中心应用中快速查看它。

方法 1：检查应用是否可以从软件中心移除

Ubuntu 有软件中心 GUI 应用，允许搜索、安装和删除应用。

搜索时，软件中心可能不会显示已安装的应用。



但是，如果向下滚动，你仍可能在“已安装”部分下找到它。外部应用通常不带徽标显示。



如果找到它，你可以通过单击“垃圾桶”图标或“删除”按钮来删除该应用。



一句话：检查是否可以从软件中心删除应用。

方法 2：使用 apt 命令删除应用

我假设你不知道该应用命令的确切名称。你可能不知道 Google Chrome 安装为 google-chrome-stable 而 Edge 安装为 microsoft-edge-stable，这很正常。

如果你知道前几个字母，那么 tab 补全可能会有所帮助。否则，你可以 使用 apt 命令列出已安装的应用 并使用 grep 搜索应用程序名称：

apt list --installed | grep -i possible_package_name


例如，你可以智能地猜测 Google Chrome 包的名称中应该包含 chrome。你可以这样搜索：

apt list --installed | grep -i chrome


在某些情况下，你可能会得到多个结果。



如果你不确定这些软件包的作用，你可以随时通过以下方式获取它们的详细信息：

apt info exact_package_name


获得确切的软件包名称后，你可以使用 apt remove 命令将其删除。

sudo apt remove exact_package_name


你还可以使用 apt-get remove 或 dpkg uninstall 命令来删除。



方法 3：使用 Synaptic 包管理器删除 deb 应用

另一种方法是使用 Synaptic 包管理器。在 GNOME 以“软件中心”的形式创建其图形包管理器之前，Synaptic 是 Ubuntu 和许多其他发行版中的默认 GUI 包管理器。

它仍然是 Xfce 桌面环境 上的推荐工具。

首先安装它：

sudo apt install synaptic


打开 Synaptic 并搜索包名称。查找标记为绿色的已安装软件包。右键单击它们，然后单击“标记为删除”。之后点击应用。



对你有帮助吗？

我非常乐意使用 apt 命令删除从 .deb 文件中安装的软件包。但我可以理解，并不是每个人都喜欢使用命令行。

在删除从外部 .deb 文件安装的应用时，我发现软件中心中找不到它。软件中心还可以做的更好一些。

我希望你现在对删除 deb 包有更好的了解。如果你有任何问题，请告诉我。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Linux Mint 终于发布了基于 Ubuntu 22.04 LTS 的 “Vanessa”，并带来了很多有用的改进。




Linux Mint 是 最受欢迎的 Linux 发行版之一。它使用 Ubuntu 作为其基础，特别是它基于 长期支持 的 Ubuntu 版本，以获得长达 5 年的软件支持。

现在，我们有一个新的版本升级，即 Linux Mint 21 “Vanessa”，它基于 4 月份最新发布的 Ubuntu 22.04 LTS 版本。因此，用户可以预期它的安全更新可以支持到 2027 年。

让我们来看看这个版本的亮点。

Linux Mint 21 Vanessa 的新亮点



它采用了稳定的、改进的 Linux 5.15 LTS 内核，Linux Mint 21 带来了一系列新的增加、变化和完善。

现有用户的升级工具



现有的 Mint 20.3 用户可以使用新的基于 GUI 的升级工具轻松更新他们的系统。

用户会看到一个需要安装或升级的新软件包的列表，这也包括了对你可能手动添加的第三方 PPA 库的检查。

新的蓝牙管理器



Blueman 现在取代了图形界面的 GNOME 蓝牙管理器 Blueberry。

之所以这样做，主要是因为 Blueman 提供了更多的功能和连接选项，以及对多种桌面环境的更好支持。此外，Blueman 的用户界面与 Linux Mint 完美地融合在一起。

Blueman 包括一些高级选项，可能大多数用户用不到，但它是一个好工具。

新的进程监控托盘图标



不管是对于资深用户还是初级用户来说，一个非常有用的功能是引入了一个新的托盘图标，可以监控进程！

这个托盘图标将通知用户是否有任何自动化进程（如更新和系统快照）在后台运行。

当系统变得缓慢时，Mint 用户将很容易知道该去哪里找到问题！

增强的缩略图支持



以前，一些文件类型没有任何缩略图显示，这样的用户体验不是很好。

为了解决这个问题，这个版本引入了一个新的项目 xapp-thumbnails，并为包括 AppImage、ePub、MP3、RAW 图片和 WebP 在内的文件类型带来了缩略图支持。

XApp 的改进

以前的 Timeshift 备份工具现在成为了一个 XApp，并由 Mint 团队正式维护。此外，在 rsync 模式下，如果快照导致磁盘上的可用空间少于 1GB，则会计算出下一次快照所需的空间并跳过下一次快照。

Xviewer、Warpinator、Thingy 和 WebApp 管理器也有了其他改进。

Cinnamon 5.4.2

Linux Mint 的旗舰桌面环境 Cinnamon 得到了良好的内部升级。

默认的窗口管理器 Muffin 现在重新基于较新的 Mutter 3.36 代码库开发。

窗口 UI 也有一些细微的改进，包括主题和动画。



其他增加的功能和改进

其他一些变化包括：


改进了对 AppImage 的支持，这与 Ubuntu 22.04 不同

目录中出现了一组新的漂亮的壁纸


你可以在我们专门的 Linux Mint 21 功能 文章中探索更多关于它的新亮点。

获取 Linux Mint 21

如果你正在使用 Mint 20.3，你应该能在几天内升级到 Mint 21。图形化的更新过程应该会在几天后出现。

你可以选择从 Linux Mint 的下载页面下载 ISO，进行全新安装。


获取 Linux Mint 21


如果你的网络速度慢或不稳定，你也可以 用这个种子链接。

享受新鲜的 Mint 吧 🙂

《陶庵回想录》，陶亢德著，中华书局2022年6月出版，580页，88.00元
对《陶庵回想录》理当有多种评论，理当有多种读后感。本文取个巧，走条捷径，写写烂熟于心的一直被正史打入另册的那些陶亢德编辑的文艺杂志，捎带着说说“陶边人物”的故事和本人集藏“陶编杂志”的故事。

于我而言，有几个巧合汇集到中华书局新出版的《陶庵回想录》上面了。

巧合一。《陶庵回想录》，铁定无疑，我将它评为心目中“2022最佳书”，一年甫半，就敢把话撂这儿。1996年我自己评“1996最佳书”的《文化古城旧事》（邓云乡著）也是中华书局出版的。1996年还是父亲考入中华书局五十周年纪念，父亲在中华书局与坐在对桌的母亲相识相恋，这以后才有了我，更以后才有了我在中华书局出的《书蠹艳异录》，父亲非常高兴，连称这是宿命轮回。

巧合二。三十几年前，我的民国杂志初旅第一步即为陶亢德参与编辑和出资的《论语》《人间世》和《宇宙风》（陶亢德简称为《论》《人》《宇》，甚妙）。

巧合三。《陶庵回想录》的“特约编辑”宋希於小老弟，在我奔走于琉璃厂旧书铺狠命搜刮老旧期刊的那几年才呱呱坠地才牙牙学语才蹒跚学步，如今小宋已全方位碾压老谢，后生可畏后生可畏，还是后生可畏。

当初读《文化古城旧事》“不忍终卷”的感觉，现在于《陶庵回想录》重现。我是“邓迷”，迷了十来年；“陶迷”历史久些，三十多年吧。作为“陶迷”，想知道的《论》《人》《宇》内幕，这书令我满足，以前知之不详的陶亢德人生际遇，这书令我战慄。

有些读者夸赞这书“史料丰富”，这话没有错，可是就我而言，如果只是满足于“拿来利用”未免自私，亦是对整部书的不公正。其实，《陶庵回想录》的史料并无啥惊人秘辛，某些人一惊一乍以为秘闻却无法砸实的史料（如某几段问答），我倒是担心今后传来传去走了样变了味，这种教训曾经发生过许多…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Linus has released the 5.19 kernel.


	On a personal note, the most interesting part here is that I did
	the release (and am writing this) on an arm64 laptop. It's
	something I've been waiting for for a _loong_ time, and it's
	finally reality, thanks to the Asahi team. We've had arm64 hardware
	around running Linux for a long time, but none of it has really
	been usable as a development platform until now.


He also notes that the next kernel is likely to be 6.0.

Significant features in 5.19 include
Arm Scalable
Matrix Extension support,
a number of io_uring improvements,
BIG TCP support,
numerous random-number
generator improvements,
support for AMD's Secure
Nested Paging and Intel's Trusted
Domain Extensions mechanisms,
support for the Loongson "LoongArch" CPU architecture,
a new proactive
reclaim mechanism,
and more.  See the LWN merge-window summaries
(part 1,
part 2) and the KernelNewbies 5.19 page
for more information.]]></summary>

an overview of some changes to the in-kernel TLS implementation coming
in the next development cycle:


	The first implementation of kTLS was designed in the good old days

	had slightly diminished and the implementation, although
	functional, was rather simple and did not retain all the
	benefits. This post covers developments in the Linux 5.20
	implementation of TLS which claws back the performance lost moving

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi so I recently came across a cool project called Linux From Scratch which essentially is a step by step guide how to build your own minimal Linux “Distro”. 
 I have allot of free time right now and think this will be a fun project to work on. Anyone here that has done this project in the past and can recommend if this is a good way to learn how Linux works from a service level? 
 I always wanted to create/have a minimal Linux based operation system without a package manager which allows you to compile binaries to use in a tty interface. I don’t even want a GUI interface (maybe support for X window system to run OpenGL applications in full screen, but thats about it, don’t need things like a window manager etc) 
 Is this a doable project for 4/6 month’s time for someone who has an C/C++ embedded and networking background? Or is this much more complicated than I initially think?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[2022年7月29日，佩洛西率团启程出访亚洲，面对佩洛西可能访台的消息，环球时报前总编辑胡锡进推文称，如果佩洛西访台，解放军驱离无效就可以击落。此文引发热议，随后推特以违反规则为由锁住胡锡进账号，并要求胡锡进删除其推文使其账号继续正常使用，胡锡进随后将其推文删除。


　　胡锡进在微博辩解称：



　　因为警告美军不要护航佩洛西访台，老胡的推特账号被锁住，除非我删除那条推文，否则不能继续使用我的推特账号。


　　北京时间昨天深夜，老胡发了如下推文：“如果美军战机护送佩洛西访台，就是侵略，解放军有权强制驱离佩洛西座机和美军战机，包括发射各种警告弹，做阻碍性飞行动作。如果驱离无效，就可以击落它们。”


　　推文一经发出，反响非常强烈，不到一小时光是转发就突破一千。很快福克斯新闻等转引这条推特的内容，有记者还要求白宫发言人就该推特的内容进行回应。


　　然而北京时间今天上午，我发现我的推特账号被锁住了。说是我发的上述这条违反了推特规则，必须删除。其实那条推特已经被屏蔽，别人看不到了，但我必须走自己动手删除的程序，并且提示我，点击“删除”意味着我承认自己违反了推特的规则。


　　有什么办法，人在屋檐下，不得不低头。我只好点击删除，给自己的推特账号解锁。唉，美丽国的言论自由看来也真是有边界的，而且类似遭遇已非我在推特上的第一次了。天下的“规则”真是有几分相似啊。


　　然而我把该传的信息传达到了：如果美军派战机为佩洛西窜访台湾护航，就是此访恶劣性质的进一步升级，构成侵略。那种情况下，我军战机应使出全部阻拦手段，如果依然无效，我认为击落佩洛西座机可也。



　　据公开资料显示，相关的推特的政策规则包含以下两点：



　　暴力：不得针对个体或群体进行暴力威胁。


　　仇恨行为：不得基于他人的种族、民族、原国籍、种姓、性取向、性别、性别认同、宗教信仰、年龄、残疾或严重疾病，宣扬针对他人的暴力，或者对他人进行威胁或骚扰。



　　微评：我觉得，这其实不仅仅是推特的政策规则问题，还涉及到了当地法律的问题。在推特上发言，应该要符合所在国的法律法规，向国家领导人发送死亡威胁算不算是一种言论自由，至少在美国是不算的，虽然佩洛西不是总统，当作为第三顺位总统接班人，在任美国国会议长，也是国家领导人之一，威胁“击落佩洛西座机”显然已经违法。即便是普通人，对其发出死亡威胁也是违法的，因为这种言论涉嫌危害他人的人身安全，是法律所不允许的。]]></summary>

Analogue 宣布将在其 Pocket 游戏机上推出《太空战！》游戏，这是一款最初为 PDP-1 小型机设计的游戏，比《Pong》整整早了十年。《太空战！》最初由 MIT 的工程师们于 1962 年创作，使用了一台 PDP-1 小型机和 1024x1024 像素的 CRT 显示器。游戏中，两个飞船在一颗恒星的引力井中进行对决。重新发布该游戏的第三方开发商使用了 OpenFPGA 和已经属于公共领域的 PDP-1 和《太空战！》的源代码。

老王点评：虽然很原始，但是这可是第一个电子游戏啊！




诺基亚宣布一同打造太空宽带

诺基亚公司表示，将提供设备将 SpaceMobile 公司的卫星连接到全球电信网络，为计划中的天基宽带网络建立一个关键环节，使之可以与移动电话一起使用。他们表示，该网络旨在为没有数字服务的人和地方提供连接。与 SpaceX 不同，SpaceMobile 的服务旨在连接到标准的、未经修改的手机，不需要特殊的软件、地面终端或硬件。


消息来源：彭博社



老王点评：诺基亚时不时出来秀一下存在感，否则真忘记了这个公司了。不过我觉得这种天基宽带挺好的，尤其是还不需要专门的设备。




一少年向上万人出售远程访问间谍软件，赚取 30 万美元

现年 24 岁的一位澳大利亚人基恩据称在其 15 岁时开发了一个远程访问间谍软件，允许用户远程控制其受害者的电脑。一旦安装了该工具，就可以用来窃取受害者的个人信息，通过网络摄像头和麦克风监视他们，并跟踪他们在电子邮件或文件中输入的内容。据称，基恩在一个黑客论坛上以 35 美元的价格出售该工具，向 128 个国家的 14500 多人出售该工具，赚取了 30 万至 40 万美元。现在他和他的母亲已经被指控多项罪名。

 来源：澎湃新闻
                

郑非（章静绘）
上海政法学院的青年学者郑非长期致力于比较政治和族群研究，在最近出版的《帝国三部曲》前两卷《帝国的技艺》和《帝国的失败》中，他对古代和近代的帝国做了探讨。在接受《上海书评》的专访时，他从帝国如何应对内外压力这个角度，剖析了“帝国的统治之道”这一问题。
《帝国的技艺》，郑非著， 一頁folio | 广西师范大学出版社2021年11月出版，480页，79.00元
 
《帝国的失败》，郑非著， 一頁folio | 广西师范大学出版社2021年11月出版，392页，69.00元
先从您的学术兴趣聊起。您为什么对“帝国”这个话题感兴趣？

郑非：我谈帝国，主要还是把帝国当成一个历史教训。我们过去一般都把帝国当成“强国”的同义词，而西方学者多数将帝国当成一种“延伸政体”（extended polity）来讨论。换句话说，如果不局限于将帝国看作强国、王朝或者皇帝的别称，而是将之视为一种延伸政体的话，显然，帝国的治理方式对今天的我们来说是具有借鉴意义的。因为帝国控制的土地足够广阔，管辖的民众也足够多样。不过，在我个人看来，帝国其实是一个多民族国家的极端案例，从政治治理角度而言，我甚至觉得，帝国相当于某种疑难病症。

我们不妨来看看历史上的各个帝国。无论英帝国、法兰西帝国、俄罗斯帝国还是哈布斯堡王朝，它们都是幅员辽阔甚至涵盖全球的大帝国，治理的人民常常过于亿万。当一个帝国涵盖的土地如此之广、治理的人口如此之多时，治理方法绝对不会如同许多人所想象的那样，靠拳头来恐吓民众合作。原因很简单，这样做效率极低，成本极高。从帝国统治者的角度来看，他总是在寻找各种方式来获得民众的配合，而这种配合，无论对皇帝、帝国还是余下的人而言都是有利的。在古代，这种配合其实比较容易获得，对地方上的头面人物，皇帝只要愿意封官许愿、缔…]]></summary>

典型的键盘只有约 100 个键位。

由于 Shift 键，许多键得以有两个字符（也称之为 字形glyph）。字形常用于键入带有重音和变音符号的字母，生成数学公式或者货币中的符号，或者添加有趣的表情符号。在一些地区，有些键甚至有三个字形。

然而，不论你身处何处，有一些字形不会出现在你的键盘上。幸运的是，Linux 提供了使用 组合键Compose Key 来获取这些字形。

在你的键盘上没有组合键这个键，至少默认情况下没有，但是你可以设定一个你不用的键作为组合键。我在电脑上使用空格键旁边的 Alt 键，而在平板上使用菜单键，来作为组合键。

在 GNOME 中设置组合键



在 GNOME 桌面，从软件库中安装 优化Tweaks 应用。你也可以从终端安装（基于 Debian 发行版用 apt 命令，Fedora 用 dnf）：

$ sudo dnf install gnome-tweaks


启动优化应用后：

Web 应用程序是在 Web 服务器上运行的软件。终端用户通过 Web 浏览器访问 Web 应用程序。Web 应用程序使用客户端—服务器（C/S）架构进行编程，该架构是用户（客户端）通过远程服务器（可能由第三方托管）提供服务。Web API（应用程序编程接口）在整个 Web 上是可用的，用户可以通过 HTTP 协议访问该接口，如图 1 所示。



本文将演示如何为地铁设计一个基于 Web 的汽车自动智能停车系统。 它是使用开源的 Node-RED 设计。该系统使用模板节点创建了一个交互式的、时尚的用户登录表单，用 HTML 和 CSS 编码以获取车主的详细信息，从而实现停车系统的自动化。我们可以在图 2 和图 3 看到登录表单和提交表单的流程图。

使用的节点如下：

Node-RED 由 node-red 命令激活。访问网址 http://127.0.0.1:1880/ 可以看到 Node-RED 用户界面流程浏览器已经启用，可以认为 Node-RED 设置已完成，可以正常工作了。

按照下面给出的步骤创建登录表单和提交表单。





登录表单

1、在节点画布中，拖放 http 输入http in 节点，这会为创建 Web 服务创建一个 HTTP 访问点。

2、将 http 输入http in 节点连接到 函数function 节点。函数节点有助于编写 JavaScript 函数处理节点接收到的消息。

Pop!_OS 是 最好的初学者友好的 Linux 发行版 之一。

它基于 Ubuntu，显然，Pop!_OS 22.04 LTS 是基于 Ubuntu 22.04 LTS 的。

然而，与 Ubuntu 不同，Pop!_OS 22.04 在发布时并没有正式支持树莓派。

因此，期待 Pop!_OS 22.04 LTS 版本对树莓派的支持是合理的。

如果你还记得，System76 在 Pop!_OS 21.10 中首次增加了对树莓派的支持。我们在测试时也 报道过。

而且，据 System76 的首席工程师 Jeremy Soller 透露， System76 最新的 Pop!_OS 版本现在正准备支持树莓派 4。

Pop!_OS 22.04 LTS for Raspberry Pi 4

如果你一直在你的树莓派 4 上使用 Pop!_OS 21.10，这对你来说是个好消息。

而且，对于任何想在树莓派 4 上尝试 Pop!_OS 的人来说，它终于有了一个 LTS 版本。

截至目前，该 ISO 是作为技术预览版提供的。因此，如果你想试试它，你应该有出现错误和可用性问题的心理预期。请注意，目前还 只限于树莓派 4，不支持其他树莓派设备，这是个遗憾。

我们不知道 System76 是否计划在这个 LTS 版本中支持其他树莓派板，或者他们是否坚持只支持树莓派 4。

然而，考虑到树莓派 4 现在相当流行，对于许多寻求替代 Ubuntu 的 树莓派的替代操作系统 的爱好者们来说，这应该是一个很好的进展。

有了 Pop!_OS 22.04 LTS，树莓派 4 的用户应该能够体验到一些最令人兴奋的升级，以及更新的 Linux 内核 5.15 LTS。

要下载该技术预览版，请前往 Pop!_OS 的 官方网站，点击下载按钮，找到该选项。



你对树莓派 4 上的 Pop!_OS 22.04 有什么期望？请在下面的评论中告诉我们你的想法。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you genuinely want to support, Mozilla Firefox, use the stock install and allow Firefox to report data automatically.
  
Many distros bundle Firefox but customize it. As a result, someone often is wasting their time, trying to figure out if an issue is with Firefox or the customization the distro added. It ends up being a lot of unnecessary wasted time that could be spent trying to improve the product (Firefox).
 The more people who participate either directly or indirectly, the more knowledge Mozilla will have to improve their browser. It is why often chromium has an advantage because you cannot opt-out, and so they know how everyone uses their browser and how to make that experience better. It's nice that you can opt-out in Mozilla, but you're not doing anyone any favors when you do.
  
You can easily download a fresh, copy of Mozilla Firefox, directly from their website. https://www.mozilla.org/firefox/browsers/ 
 Ultimately, the more people who use a clean copy of Mozilla Firefox, and participate in the basic analytics, the better the browser can be. This is the best passive way, you can help Mozilla Firefox.
 Additionally, if you wish to take a more active role, you can also directly submit bugs and provide direct feedback. Information on this can be located here https://support.mozilla.org/kb/file-bug-report-or-feature-request-mozilla
 I made a simple installer, so even newbies could install a clean, stock experience directly from Mozilla (along with all the shortcuts). It works independently, so it has no impact on the packages you have installed. You can install any edition of Mozilla Firefox, side by side, if you wish, including your distro's bundled copy. Lastly, if you don't want it installed for everyone, or are not the system admin, I also have a personal, localized installer too (keeps everything in your home folder). https://github.com/Linux-Is-Best/Firefox-automatic-install-for-Linux

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[My first ever PC was with an AMD gpu. When it's Hard drive was on it's knees I switched to linux. For a lot of things the performance improved but for gaming performance worsened. I played CSGO then and all of the benchmarks suggest better performance. I even talked to a dude with a gt 610 who before switching to linux barely got 50fps but when he did he got 100+ fps. At the moment I am an unfortunate Windows user hoping one day I'll get back to Linux without triggering my family, since I have a gtx 1650 now.

在汽车尤其是自动驾驶汽车上安放传感器涉及大量的变量，如底盘设计，有没有障碍物（不同位置提供了不同视野），风阻和重量平衡等等，这需要大量的试错，不同的车型还需要重新制定不同的方案。宝马汽车的问题涉及到了 3854 个变量和 500 个约束条件，经典计算机解决这个问题需要大量的时间。量子计算公司 QCI 使用的是其新量子硬件，在 6 分钟内解决了该问题，提供了一个由 15 个传感器构成的方案。


消息来源：Tom's Hardware



老王点评：居然可以解决某种具体问题了？那说明量子计算步入实用更进一步了。




亚马逊将关闭其网盘存储服务

亚马逊周五早上发送电子邮件通知用户，将于 2023 年 12 月 31 日关闭其已运营 11 年的网盘存储服务，以更充分地将精力集中在“亚马逊照片”上。亚马逊表示，用户帐户中的照片和视频已自动保存到亚马逊照片中。如果你依靠该服务进行文件存储，则需要在结束服务日期之前访问并下载文件。


消息来源：Geek Wire



老王点评：看来网盘服务盈利前景堪忧啊，有这个风向标，国内的网盘服务会如何呢？




QEMU 7.1 将带来龙芯架构支持

QEMU 7.1-rc0 已经发布，其稳定版本将在几周后发布。QEMU 7.1 将初始支持 64 位龙芯架构的 3A5000 系列 SoC。QEMU 7.1 也将支持更多的 RISC-V 特性，如 RISC-V 特权规格 1.12 版，改进的 PMU 实现，Zmmul 扩展等。对于 QEMU 迁移，它现在支持 Linux 上的零拷贝发送，以减少源主机上的 CPU 使用率。


消息来源：Phoronix



老王点评：龙芯不断地将各种驱动提交到上游，可见其发展速度在加快。]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[For some reason everyone seems to have an extreme hate of chromium based browsers and I don't get why. I can kinda see because most people use chromium based browsers (chrome specifically), but aside from that I don't see any reason why to hate it. You can de-google chromium with relative ease, and harden it just like Firefox or any other FOSS browser. Is there something I'm just missing?
 PS: Sorry if this is the wrong subreddit, most of the chromium hate I see is in Linux subreddits so I thought it would make sense to post here.

战争是人类近乎永恒的话题，早在文明诞生以前，已经出现战争，而在可预见的未来，仍无法避免战争。战争也是人类社会的大事，文明之兴衰，政权之存续，亿兆黎民之命运，无不深受其影响。战争还是历史故事的核心素材，尽管稍有良知的人，都不该热衷于战争，但无可否认的是，战争中的那些英风豪气、奇计良谋，总能传诵千古，脍炙人口。中国历朝历代，汉末三国的战争故事尤其引人瞩目，早在唐代或已广泛流传民间，在今天更可谓家喻户晓。因此，研究战争，特别是汉末三国的战争，分析各方的攻守战略，探讨战略的利钝得失，以深究胜负之机、兴衰之理，不仅是古今众多史家共同聚焦的重要议题，而且是无数普通人也津津乐道的热点话题。

一个既有千百年深厚学术积累，又有千万人广泛社会参与的议题，乍看起来，早已“题无剩义”，其实不然。因为三国史的相关史料极其匮乏，对钩沉考索的文献解读能力要求很高，普通人未获专门训练，所论往往难得要领。至于专业的历史学者，虽然对这个议题多有研究，且不乏卓见，但一失于零散（以单篇论文为主），二失于简略（多纵论立国纲领和战略方针），导致许多关键问题依旧有待索解，部分成说亦稍嫌不够深入。直到几年前，宋杰先生《三国兵争要地与攻守战略研究》一书问世，才彻底改变这一局面。该书以空间为经，以时间为纬，以魏、蜀、吴三国政权为纲，以合肥、寿春、濡须、武昌、夏口、襄阳、江陵、夷陵、永安、汉中、祁山等军事要镇为目，对三国总体的攻防战略，以及相互间的历次重要战役，做出了系统、翔实、深入的研究。近期，宋先生又出版新著《三国军事地理与攻防战略》，补充论述了前著未涉及或未…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[美东时间周五，阿里巴巴被美国证券交易委员会（SEC）列入“预摘牌”名单，面临退市的风险。截至收盘，阿里巴巴股价下跌11%，至89.37美元，当月累计下跌21.4%。


　　根据美国2020年通过的《外国公司问责法》（HFCAA），如果在美上市外国公司连续三年无法让美国监管机构检查审计底稿，可能会被强制退市。几天前，阿里发布了2022财年年报，当时外界就预计该公司很可能会被SEC列入“预摘牌”名单。


　　2014年，阿里巴巴赴美IPO，是当时历史上规模最大的IPO。截至本周五收盘，阿里巴巴市值2366.64亿美元（约合人民币1.59万亿元），已经距离2020年末的市值高点缩水超70%。


　　近日，阿里已经宣布申请在香港把上市地位从第二上市改为主要上市，预期将于2022年年底前生效。


　　相关主要上市流程完成后，阿里将实现在纽约证券交易所和香港联交所的双重主要上市。券商分析师认为，在港双重上市企业有机会纳入港股通，有望获得更高的流动性，提高公司的融资能力。


　　“在香港申请主要上市身份并不一定意味着他们认为自己会在美国退市……这只是为了降低潜在风险。”美国老虎证券分析师Bo Pei表示。


　　除阿里外，周五被列入名单的其他公司包括蘑菇街、波奇宠物、猎豹移动公司等。

python program.py


然而，如果你试图在 Ubuntu（和其他一些发行版）中使用 python 命令，它会抛出一个错误。

command ‘python’ not found, did you mean:
command ‘python3’ from deb python3
command ‘python’ from deb python-is-python3


如果你注意这个错误信息，它说明了很多东西。这里的 python 命令实际上是 python3。

如果你不理解，不用担心。我将在这里详细解释。

为什么在 Ubuntu 上没有发现 python 命令？

这是因为 Python 语言不是以 python 的形式安装的，而是以 python3 或 python2 的形式安装的（在一些老的 Ubuntu 版本中）。

在遥远的过去的某个时间点，Python 实际上是作为 python 包/可执行文件提供的。当 Python 发布第二版时，Ubuntu 和其他发行版不得不同时支持 Python 1.x 和 2.x 版本。

因此，他们将较新的 Python 版本命名为 python2，以区分这两个版本。其他应用或库也在其代码中指定 python 或 python2。

最终，Python 1 版本被完全停用，但软件包继续被命名为 python2。

类似地，当 Python 3 版本发布时，发行版开始同时提供 python2 和 python3 包。

Python 2 不再被支持，Python 3.x 是你在 Ubuntu 上安装的版本。该软件包仍被命名为 python3。

总结一下，你已经在 Ubuntu 上安装了 Python。它是以…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm seeing a lot of marketing surrounding ChromeOS Flex and many YouTubers, who didn't even know what an OS is are making videos claiming ChromeOS Flex to be the only OS in existence that can make your old PC come back to life. Obviously, all of this is pretty frustrating to look at when you already know the better alternatives.
 One claim that often seems to come up, is ChromeOS is backed by a big corporation. A corporation you can 'trust' (whatever that means) and a corporation that has the best privacy and security measures for an OS.
 So I'd like to ask, how much worse is ChromeOS from a security and privacy standpoint, compared to other beginner distros like ZorinOS, Linux Mint or Ubuntu. As a FOSS fan, I obviously have a bias against it but I'd like to hear some opinions and objective points.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It's interesting to notice that when Linux installs, most of them ask if you want to install alongside your other OS, and when they replace the boot loader, they replace it with something that allows you to access your previously installed OSes if still present.
 On the other hand, we have Microsoft Windows. Which doesn't seem to know what "other OS" is, and when it overwrites your boot loader, it overwrites it with something that can only see WIndows and will only let you boot to Windows.
 What I'm wondering is how that latter behavior hasn't been caught on to as a way to squelch competition? Yeah, maybe it's not as common as pasting icons all over people's desktops, but when someone is trying to flip between OSes, and one of those OSes is actively trying to prevent that and interfere with that, shouldn't it be a serious issue?

会议开场，由龙蜥社区理事长马涛发言：“首先感谢各位，今年疫情反反复复，此次我们能够齐聚一堂真的很不容易。过去一年虽然经历了很多风雨和坎坷，但龙蜥社区取得的成绩还是可圈可点的！去年这个时间点，我们坐在一起为社区制定了详细的规章制度，经历了一年的运作，也一定有一些新的想法产生，我们在聚焦当下的同时也应该遥想未来该做点什么，以及是否有新的目标使命和愿景。

龙蜥社区副理事长张磊也强调了龙蜥社区将各家聚集在一起的意义。他说道：“最近一年充满了各种不确定性，不论是疫情还是各行业发展、技术发展以及龙蜥开源操作系统社区。个人觉得有句话对于所有希望成功的社区很适用：一人行快，众人行远。我希望社区未来在技术、理论和运营等层面继续做出更大的成绩，让我们的社区以及社区代表的各个产业的业务都能有更高层次的进展。”



接下来，龙蜥社区迎来新一届换届选举。会上，理事长和副理事长分别进行选举演讲与工作总结，各位理事代表举手表决，最终全票通过，表决生效。马涛继续担任龙蜥社区理事长，张磊继续担任龙蜥社区副理事长，其他理事成员无变动。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[如果你想获得安全的体验，你可能不会再继续使用 32 位 Linux 内核。




我们有很多 为 32 位系统定制的 Linux 发行版。

那么，为什么我想要不鼓励使用 32 位，而升级到 64 位 Linux 呢？

有几个原因，其中一个最大的原因，在本周引发了很多关注。

32 位：古老的电子垃圾硬件？

没错，与其他操作系统不同的是，Linux 发行版允许你重新利用旧硬件。

你能够将一个老机器转换为 媒体服务器、存储服务器，等等。

在这里，我并不是要给你一些如何贡献更多的电子垃圾的思路。尽可能长地利用你的硬件，而不更换它们总是好的。

然而，不使用 32 位系统的理由可能比以往更有说服力。关键的问题是在安全和维护方面。

利用 64 位 Linux 提高安全性

2018 年，危险的处理器安全问题 Spectre 漏洞引发了热议。虽然英特尔和 AMD 对这个漏洞进行了修复，但情况并不乐观。

不幸的是，一个新的漏洞 Retbleed，它是 Spectre 的一个变种，正在影响英特尔和 AMD 芯片。

你可以在下面由发现它的研究人员分享的视频中看到它的情况。




因此，我们自然需要适当的措施来解决这个新的安全漏洞的修复问题。

令人震惊的事情来了。64 位 Linux 内核已经收到了对它的修复，以保护有关的英特尔/AMD 的处理器。但是，正如 Phoronix 所报道的，Linux 32 位内核仍然容易受到 Retbleed 漏洞的影响。

英特尔的 Pawan Gupta 在 内核邮件列表 中回应了这些担忧，他提到：


英特尔不知道还有谁在 Skylake 那一代的 CPU 上使用 32 位模式的生产环境。所以这不应该是一个问题。


另外，很少看到为 32 位维护所做的任何努力。所以，这应该不算什么意外。

因此，如果你使用你的系统进行任何可能受到安全问题影响的任务，你应该避开 32 位内核。

当然，如果你有一个完全离线的环境可以算做例外。所以，你可以这样做，但不建议这样做。

不关心安全问题？

即使你认为得不到像 Retbleed 这样的关键安全修复没有关系，2022 年的 32 位系统也会有更多的麻烦。

软件维护者们最终会放弃对 32 位系统上的工具和 Linux 发行版的更新。

因此，你的 32 位 Linux 系统可能很快就不会再有积极维护的程序了。

因此，现在进行转换（和升级）将是一个好主意。

你还在使用 32 位的 Linux 吗？你对此有什么看法？在下面的评论中分享你的想法。

I know Linux has a reputation for being power hungry, but I installed auto-cpufreq and all the cores of my CPU just remained at 1200mhz whilst browsing the web. The fans only occasionally kicked in lightly and when they did, I didn't even notice it as the 3500u barely went above 50C! This is such an improvement compared to windows where CPU usage spiked randomly as well as temps following suit, the fans would rapidly kick in loudly and my battery would be drained quickly. This is just a post of appreciation for Linux and I am now considering full time switching from Windows.

 Little, hah. 
 Next thing you find out is thaty the device is very picky about what it'll boot to. MBR Ventoy won't work. YOu have to use a UEFI/GPT Ventoy, or an MBR Yumi. Or just use Rufus or a similar tool to set it up. Ok, b…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[7月28日，网传，网上流传着一份录音和一些聊天截图，有自称每日优鲜的员工称，公司原地解散，内部飞书及VPN停用，感谢所有供应商对过往的支持。还有的截图显示，上一波被裁员的赔偿金不发了，在职员工6、7月工资也没了，高层全部失联等。


　　生鲜电商每日优鲜内部宣布公司解散？


　　据界面新闻报道，每日优鲜员工张强（化名）所说，今日约下午2时，每日优鲜HR在飞书上召开线上会议，称公司新一轮融资尚未到账，无法于约定期限支付员工被拖欠工资，同时告知员工“工作就截止到今天了。”


　　“实际上就是暴力裁员。”该员工表示，目前除人力、财务等行政部门留作善后之外，其余业务部门均以飞书线上会议的形式收到了上述通知。


　　在通知过程中，每日优鲜创始人徐正并未露面。据一份员工共享的录音文件可知，线上会议全程由一位HRBP及现商品负责人肖运贵主持。


　　肖运贵解释称，目前新融资仍在交涉的过程中，每日优鲜已经在SEC发布公告和备案，但由于目前并未完全交割，在投资款尚未到账前，大多数同事的工资将暂缓发放，公司会尽力争取以实物资产和股权等方式进行变现来支付员工的工资。


　　界面新闻了解到，截至目前每日优鲜仍有员工6、7月份的工资未发放，社保与公积金也存在断缴情况。对此，每日优鲜HRBP介绍称，7月的社保公积金将依然由公司缴纳，但是8月就需要自行缴纳，社保公积金的补缴优先级会高于工资。


　　对于“公司解散”、“员工离职”等消息，每日优鲜工作人员回应称，在实现盈利的大目标下，公司对业务及组织进行调整。次日达、智慧菜场、零售云等业务不受影响。由于业务调整，部分员工离职，公司目前正积极寻求一切可能的方案，最大限度保障员工权益。


　　另据澎湃新闻报道，有内部人员向记者表示，目前还有同事在职。

 Does anyone know if there is a plan to add Wayland forwarding to SSH, or some way to forward Wayland apps?
 EDIT: After some advice from u/throwaway6560192, I figured it out:
 On my setup, QT apps will only run over waypipe after setting QT_QPA_PLATFORM=kde. Additionally, some graphical glitches were being caused by not loading the theme correctly, which can be fixed by setting XDG_CURRENT_DESKTOP=kde (on both waypipe and ssh -X).
 ~~~ $ waypipe ssh user@server user@server's password: $ QT_QPA_PLATFORM=wayland XDG_CURRENT_DESKTOP=kde dolphin ~~~

年轻时的帕切科

2010年在墨西哥某大学发表演讲的帕切科
翻开墨西哥当代文学名人录，集诗人、小说家、散文家和翻译家等角色于一身的何塞·埃米利奥·帕切科，无疑是位领军人物。2006年，帕切科当选为墨西哥语言学院名誉院士。2009年，他获得享有“西班牙文学家诺贝尔奖”之称的塞万提斯文学奖，并得到这样的评价“（帕切科）是一位独特的作家，是我们语言之整体的代表。他的作品描述日常生活，表达深刻、自由的思想，他善于塑造一个特别的世界，与现实保持别有含义的距离，他对西班牙语的运用完美无缺”。

帕切科首先是一位诗人，与定居墨西哥的阿根廷诗人胡安·赫尔曼以及1990年诺贝尔文学奖得主奥克塔维奥·帕斯并称现当代墨西哥诗坛三巨头。上世纪六十年代，年轻的帕切科崭露头角，开始高产的诗歌创作。先后出版了诗集《夜之元素》《莫问我时光如何流逝》《你将一去不返》《海上的工作》《记忆之城》《流沙》以及《或迟或早》等。几乎囊括了西语世界所有重要的诗歌奖项，其中包括2003年奥克塔维奥·帕斯诗歌散文奖、2004年巴勃罗·聂鲁达诗歌奖、2005年加西亚·洛尔迦国际诗歌奖以及2009年的索菲娅王后伊比利亚美洲诗歌奖。

帕切科的诗歌明快清丽、平白如话，没有过多粉饰雕琢，以平实的语言入木三分地描绘现世、直抒胸臆，充满嘲弄讽刺和黑色幽默。在帕切科看来，诗人是时代的批评家，应关注和反思历史的意义。他的每一首诗都以富含想象力的方式剖析日常生活中的某一元素，承载着社会伦理的价值。“我写的是我的所见所闻，而我的所见所闻是不容乐观的。”对社会现实的严肃思考，源于帕切科始终为墨西哥民众的生存状况忧虑，为弱者呐喊。

诗集《从那时起》包含帕切科对时间、艺术、自然和人类存在的思考，认为自然的时间无限循环，而人类的时间有限且呈线性，人类好比鱼缸中的鱼儿，看不…]]></summary>

安全研究人员发现 UEFI 的 Rootkit 并不罕见，而且难以检测。卡巴斯基研究人员在对一种复杂的 UEFI Rootkit 研究后表示：“这种 UEFI 植入物似乎自 2016 年底以来就已经在野外使用，这甚至早在 UEFI 攻击开始被公开描述之前。”

老王点评：这说明很可能在我们都毫不知情的情况下，已经被偷偷入侵和窃取了很多信息。




DeepMind 发布几乎所有已知蛋白质的预测结构

蛋白质由氨基酸链组成，折叠成复杂的形状，这在很大程度上决定了它们的功能。一旦你知道蛋白质是如何折叠的，你就可以开始了解它是如何工作的，以及如何改变它的行为。2020 年 11 月，DeepMind 宣布已开发出一个名为 AlphaFold 的程序，可以使用算法快速预测其结构。去年，DeepMind 发布了 20 个物种的蛋白质结构——包括人类表达的几乎所有 20,000 种蛋白质。现在它已经完成了这项工作，并发布了超过 2 亿种蛋白质的预测结构。基本上，你可以认为它涵盖了整个蛋白质宇宙。

新版 GB18030 字符集标准发布

市场监管总局标准委发布了最新的 GB 18030 中文编码字符集。GB 18030 首次发布于 2000 年，2005 年第一次修订，这是第二次修订。2022 标准将于 2023 年 8 月 1 日正式实施，共收录汉字 87887 个，比上一版增加录入了 1.7 万余个生僻汉字。除了汉字，还包括了 10 种我国的少数民族语言的文字。

React 是一个建立在 HTML、CSS 和 JavaScript 之上的 UI 框架，其中 JavaScript（JS）负责大部分的逻辑。如果你对变量、数据类型、数组函数、回调、作用域、字符串方法、循环和其他 JS DOM 操作相关的主题有一定了解，这些将极大地加快学习 ReactJS 的步伐。

你对现代 JavaScript 的概念将决定你能多快地掌握 ReactJS 的步伐。你不需要成为一个 JavaScript 专家来开始你的 ReactJS 之旅，但就像对食材的了解是任何希望掌握烹饪的厨师所必须的一样，学习 ReactJS 也是如此。它是一个现代的 JavaScript UI 库，所以你需要了解一些 JavaScript。问题是，需要多少？

示例解释

假设我被要求用英语写一篇关于“牛”的文章，但我对这种语言一无所知。在这种情况下，为了让我成功地完成任务，我不仅要对主题有概念，还要对指定的语言有概念。

假设我获得了一些关于主题（牛）的知识，我如何计算我需要知道多少英语才能写出规定的主题？如果我必须用英语写一篇关于其他复杂话题的文章呢？

这很难搞清楚，不是吗？我不知道我要写关于这个话题的什么东西，但它可能是任何东西。所以要想开始，我必须要有适当的英语知识，但还不止于此。

极端现实

在开始使用 ReactJS 之前，所需的 JavaScript 数量也是如此。根据我的例子情景，ReactJS 是话题“牛”，而 JavaScript 是英语。要想在 ReactJS 中获得成功，对 JavaScript 的掌握很重要。如果没有适当的 JavaScript 基础，一个人是很难专业地掌握 ReactJS 的。无论我对这个主题有多少知识，如果我不知道语言的基础，我就不能正确地表达自己。

多少才算够？

根据我的经验，当你开始你的 ReactJS 之旅时，你应该已经熟悉了：


变量

数据类型

字符串方法

循环

条件式


你应该对这些具体的 JavaScript 熟悉。但这些只是最基本的先决条件。当你试图创建一个简单的 React 应用时，你将不可避免地需要处理事件。所以，普通函数、函数表达式、语句、箭头函数的概念，箭头函数和普通函数的区别，以及这两类函数中 this 关键字的词义范围，这确实很重要。

但问题是，如果我必须使用 ReactJS 创建一个复杂的应用怎么办？

获得启发

在 JavaScript 中处理事件、传播操作符、解构、命名导入和默认导入将帮助你理解 React 代码的工作机制。

最重要的是，你必须了解 JavaScript 本身背后的核心概念。JavaScript 在设计上是异步的。当出现在文件底部的代码在文件顶部的代码之前执行时，不要惊讶。像 promise、callback、async-await、map、filter 和 reduce 这样的结构，是 ReactJS 中最常见的方法和概念，尤其是在开发复杂的应用时。

最主要的是要精通 JavaScript，这样你可以减少 ReactJS 之旅的复杂性。

越来越好

我很容易说出你需要知道的东西，但你去学习它完全是另一回事。大量练习 JavaScript 是必不可少的，但你可能会感到惊讶，我认为这并不意味着你必须等到掌握它。有些概念事先很重要，但你可以在学习过程中学到很多东西。练习的一部分是学习，所以你可以开始使用 JavaScript，甚至是 React 的一些基础知识，只要你以舒适的速度移动并理解在你尝试任何严肃的事情之前做你的“家庭作业”是一个要求。

立即开始使用 JavaScript

不要费心等到你了解了 JavaScript 的所有方面。那永远不会发生。如果这样做，你将陷入学习 JavaScript 的永远循环中。你们都知道技术领域是如何不断发展和迅速变化的。如果你想开始学习 JavaScript，请尝试阅读 Mandy Kendall 的介绍性文章 通过编写猜谜游戏学习 JavaScript。这是一种快速入门的好方法，当你看到了可能的情况，我认为你可能会发现很难停下来。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Debian 会考虑在官方版本中添加非自由固件吗？如果他们想解决 Debian 开发人员重点提出的问题，这似乎是一种可能性。




由于 Debian 的稳定性和新功能之间的平衡，它是最受欢迎的 Linux 发行版之一。

此外，它不附带任何非自由固件。

但是，对于想要在较新硬件上使用 Debian 的用户来说，这已成为一个问题。

大多数最新的设备和配置都需要非自由固件才能正常工作，其中包括 Wi-Fi、图形等。

为了解决这个问题，Debian 开发人员、前 Debian 项目负责人 Steve McIntyre 已经积极讨论了一段时间。

正如 Geeker's Digest 所发现的，在 DebConf 22 会议上，Steve 最近向用户和开发人员着重谈到了修复固件混乱这件事。

在官方版本中包含非免费固件

至于目前的情况，你可以找到带有非自由固件的非官方 Debian 镜像。

然而，并不是每个用户都知道它，即使它在 Debian 的下载页面上被宣传，“非官方”也不是用户更喜欢推荐的镜像的东西。

此外，当用户可以选择 Ubuntu 或任何基于 Ubuntu 的发行版作为替代方案时，期望用户安装非自由固件也是违反直觉的。

不仅限于这些问题，Steve 在他的 博客 中还提到了其他一些问题，包括：


维护单独的非自由镜像非常耗时。

由于缺乏非自由固件，许多用户不喜欢官方镜像。


如果我们希望更多用户在通用硬件上使用 Debian，Steve 建议尽早解决这个问题。

可能会通过安装程序中的提示让用户安装非自由固件，类似于 Ubuntu 所做的。

此外，在他在 DebConf 22 的演讲中，似乎大多数开发人员投票支持在官方 Debian 镜像中添加非自由固件。

随着他重点提出这件事，Steve 得到了寻找解决这个问题的社区用户/开发人员的更多关注。

简单/方便的出路：在官方发布的镜像中添加非自由固件。

那么，Debian 最终会在其新版本中添加对非自由固件的支持吗？ Debian 12 会让这成为现实吗？

在下面的评论中分享你的想法。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi HN!
Roughly two years ago when the pandemic had people shifting to a WFH environment, I started a twice-weekly newsletter called Workspaces that gives readers a behind the scenes tour of their favorite entrepreneurs, designers, developers, etc. new desk setups.
Growth has remained consistent week to week, relying on the featured guests Twitter presence to help spread the word.
I have featured 175 workspaces to date (70+ more in the backlog) and have grown the newsletter to 7,000 subscribers while maintaining a >50% open rate.
I published the fist 117 editions of the newsletter without a sponsor. I had inbound requests but I was focused on growing the subscriber base as much as possible. With the new year, I shifted this focus slightly and began offering one sponsor slot per newsletter edition.
Since then, the newsletter has been sold out weekly and the price has risen from the initial $150 to $250, earning $2,000 per month from sponsorships.
I think it’s important to note that this was not an immediate cash cow… sending out 117 editions of a newsletter without receiving a dime can be draining. You have to truly enjoy the content you are putting out (I do!).
However, I think this shows that consistency rules and as long as you continue to show up, put out great content and iterate based on feedback you will continue to see your newsletter grow and ultimately the money will come.
Happy to answer any questions around newsletter growth, finding sponsors, etc!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[On Monday I start an apprenticeship as a software developer. I will get my own laptop with root rights and everyone is allowed to choose the distribution. The company develops a product based on Debian, so all developers there use Linux. The development is done on VM's with the product. As far as I know Ubuntu is the standard and my instructor uses Debian. I can do my work with both and handle them as well, but I hate snap on Ubuntu and Debian has too old packets for me. At home I've been using Arch linux for almost 3 years and I get along wonderfully and I never had any problems. And since I am a new trainee I think he wants me to use Ubuntu or Debian first. Do you have any ideas how I can convince my instructor to let me use Arch on my laptop?

 To be honest, I have found that Linux gaming is pretty much on a similar level to Windows.
 I am by no means a tech savvy person. I am probably below average, compared to the average person. I do know the internal components of my PC, though, and I can troubleshoot software bugs or solve some problems on my own. And that's really all you need to know for Linux gaming. Well, that, and the ability to Google "stuff".
 Via Steam, all you need to do is to use Proton, and most games will work out of the box, no issues. Most of Valve's first party games even have a native Linux port.
 I have a pretty sizeable GOG library, it's my favourite store. They don't have a Linux client. But…]]></summary>

据一家国外网站不完全统计，预计到明年 3 月（按照谷歌的预告），谷歌画上句号的硬件产品有 267 款。其中包括 Nexus 手机（2012-2015）、谷歌眼镜（2012-2015）、谷歌 Cardboard VR 纸盒（2014-2019）等等。

老王点评：看来谷歌还需要在硬件上证明自己，不过似乎这些只有苹果在硬件上一直保持不错的成绩，其它软件大厂大多在硬件上的成功不如其软件。




漏洞披露 15 分钟后黑客就开始扫描

最近发布的一份事故响应报告称，黑客一直在监视安全公司的新漏洞披露报告，通常在 CVE 公布 15 分钟后就开始扫描漏洞，在数小时内就能观察到首次漏洞利用尝试。以 2022 年 5 月 4 日披露的 F5 BIG-IP 远程执行漏洞 CVE-2022-1388 为例，在 CVE 公布 10 小时内就记录到了 2552 次扫描和漏洞利用尝试。据该报告，2022 年上半年利用最多的漏洞是 ProxyShell 占 55%，其次是 Log4Shell 占 14%，SonicWall 7%，ProxyLogon 5%。

老王点评：从 CVE 公布之时，就是安全专家和黑客赛跑的发令枪。我觉得作为安全专家，真是太难了。

 Everything on Windows is built for the GUI, and Command Prompt sucked ass. Windows Terminal and PowerShell are decent but old habits die hard. It was a text input prompt and not much more. Until recently you couldn't install software using it (pls daddy Microsoft make winget at least as good as Chocolately while you're at it) and most other core system utilities don't use it. You can't modify settings with it. When you are describing to someone how to do something, you are forced to describe how to do it In the GUI.
 Linux gives you a choice. The terminal is powerful enough to do anything a GUI can. So when you're writing instructions to a beginner describing how to do something, you're obviously going to say:

 As some may have noticed Epic Games announced official Linux binaries this month. This option has now been added to the Epic Asset Manager.
 This is part of continuous effort to make life with Unreal Engine on Linux easier.
 The recommended way of getting Epic Asset Manager is through flathub so if you want to give it a go, try that route.
 P.S.: For those who do not know EAM lets you download Unreal marketplace assets you have previously purchased, add them to your projects, create new projects and most importantly Install the engine without the need of compilation, which not only saves time but also disk space.
 Some bugs and future breakage is expected, but the more people use the tool, the sooner it gets ironed out.

在这篇文章中，我们将会明白 Docker 是什么，如何 在 Ubuntu 中安装 Docker 引擎 。此外，我们也将会明白如何 安装 Docker Compose ，它是一个定义并运行多容器的 Docker 应用。

我们已经在 Ubuntu 22.04 LTS 中正式的测试了这份指南。然而，它也应该对旧版本如 20.04 LTS 和 18.04 LTS 有效。为了更好的安全性和稳定性，我推荐你使用最新的版本 —— Ubuntu 22.04 LTS 。

什么是 Docker ？

Docker 是一个快捷、轻便的系统级虚拟化技术，开发者和系统管理员可以使用它构建具备所有必要依赖项的应用程序，并将其作为一个包发布。

Docker 与其他如 VMWare 、Xen 、以及 VirtualBox 等工具的虚拟化方式不同，每个虚拟机不需要单独的客户操作系统。

所有的 Docker 容器有效地共享同一个主机系统内核。每个容器都在同一个操作系统中的隔离用户空间中运行。

Docker 容器可以在任何 Linux 版本上运行。比如说你使用 Fedora ，我用 Ubuntu 。我们能相互开发、共享并分发 Docker 镜像。

你无需担心操作系统、软件以及自定义设置，任何事都不用担心。只要我们的主机安装了 Docker ，就能持续开发。简言之，Docker 能够在任何地方运行！

前文中你读到了两个词：Docker 镜像 和 Docker 容器 ，或许你在想它们的区别。

通俗地说，Docker 镜像是一个描述容器应该如何表现的文件，而 Docker 容器是 Docker 镜像的运行（或停止）状态。

希望你能够理解 Docker 的基础概念。更多细节，你可以…]]></summary>

《民主雅典的精英与大众：演说术、意识意态和人民权力》， 约西亚•奥博著，何典译，郑州大学出版社/汉唐阳光，2022年5月版，524页，128.00元
美国著名古典学者约西亚·奥博（Josiah Ober）的《民主雅典的精英与大众: 演说术、意识形态和人民权力》（原书名Mass and Elite in Democratic Athens Rhetoric, Ideology, and the Power of the People，1989；何典译，郑州大学出版社，2022年5月）是一部古代政治史研究的名著，该书在三十多年后才有中译本，实在是遗憾的事情。著名书评家刘铮（乔纳森）对该书中译本的评语是“这部书的译出，大约属于‘有为而译’——为了某种政治的、社会的意向或意愿而进行翻译。不过原著是严谨的，译者是矜慎的，相信这个译本会为探讨西方古代政治制度的学者们提供有益的参考框架。”（乔纳森《2022年第二季度新书过眼录》，“乔纳森读书”，2022，7，5）在我的阅读经验中，能够得到刘铮肯定的译本总是可以令人放心的。刘苏里说，如果第一时间出中文版，这三十来年的一些争议能否免去不少？比如精英与大众关系的讨论、民主退潮的忧虑，以及五花八门的民主模式的宣示。他认为约西亚·奥博该书尽量在历史论证与经世致用之间取得了平衡，否则该书不可能在三十多年后还被人记得。（来自新版微博 weibo.com，5-27）该书的“序”的题目则证实了什么是“有为而译”：“向雅典的经验与教训学习”，非常朴实和接地气的一句话，就把为什么我们今天仍有必要读这部“旧著”的理由讲了。

回想我们当年学习世界古代史的时候，对于雅典民主进程的认识就靠教科书上那几个里程碑式的路标：从梭伦改革（前594年）、克里斯提尼改革（前508年）、伯里克利时代（前5世纪），然后…]]></summary>

 来源：澎湃新闻
                

斯塔尔夫人
1815年，拿破仑兵败滑铁卢，“百日王朝”土崩瓦解，这位法兰西第一帝国皇帝被流放至圣赫勒拿岛，并老死于斯。据牛津大学古登（Angelica Goodden）教授在《斯塔尔夫人：危险的流放》（Madame de Staël: The Dangerous Exile，2008）一书中考证，皇帝晚年最耿耿于怀的，既不是打败他的威灵顿公爵，也不是背叛他的贝尔纳多特元帅（1763-1844），而是与这两人关系密切的斯塔尔夫人——“她的家几乎成了反对我的军火库”，拿破仑在回忆录中写道，“到那里去的人，都受封成了她的十字军武士”。事实上，与第七次反法同盟大军决战之前，拿破仑曾派人向女作家致意，表示有心和解，但遭到后者拒绝。她答复使者说，她要活着看到皇帝“最终垮台”，因为她始终牢记父亲内克尔先生的遗言：“在逆境中把头抬起，不要让世界上任何一个人把你踩在脚下，无论他多么强大。”

内克尔是欧洲著名银行家。作为路易十六的财政大臣，他曾建议取消第一等级（教士）和第二等级（贵族）特权，与第三等级一体纳税，以此摆脱波旁王朝的财政危机。由于触动权贵阶层利益，内克尔被罢免，并在法国大革命爆发后出走巴黎，定居瑞士。1810年，在拿破仑势力鼎盛之际，内克尔发表政治檄文《最后的见解》，痛斥拿破仑穷兵黩武，祸乱欧洲，并预言其军事独裁必将很快垮台。在这位老派人士眼中，拿破仑不像一个半世纪前恢复英国君主立宪制、功成身退的英雄蒙克将军（1608-1670），而“更像克伦威尔”。

这也是斯塔尔夫人对拿破仑的评价。日后她在《法国大革命断想》《十年流亡记》等著作中对拿破仑的治国理政及人格心理进行了更为深入的剖析。在她看来，拿破仑打着革命旗号，窃取大革命的胜利果实，但在攫取政权后，立刻改弦更张，迈向专制独裁——以“保卫法兰…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all, I read a Bloomberg article today (https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-07-27/fed-raise...) stating the following:
"Powell also said the Fed will slow the pace of increases [to interest rates] at some point"
This is referencing a 3rd derivative (loan obligation = base, interest rate = 1st derivative, change in interest rate  = 2nd derivative, pace of changes in interest rate = 3rd derivative).
I was wondering if hackernews had any other interesting examples of higher order derivatives that one might encounter in everyday life.

 About the project
 https://github.com/warp-tech/warpgate
 Warpgate is a smart SSH, HTTPS and MySQL bastion host for Linux (and macOS!) that doesn't need special client apps.
  
Set it up in your DMZ, add user accounts and easily assign them to specific hosts and URLs within the network.
 Warpgate will record every session for you to view (live) and replay later through a built-in admin web UI.
 Not a jump host - forwards your connections straight to the target instead.
 2FA support
 Single binary with no dependencies.
 Written in 100% safe Rust.

advice for developers of locking schemes in the kernel.


	Validating locking by hand against all the other locking designs
	and nesting rules the kernel has overall is nigh impossible,
	extremely slow, something only few people can do with any chance of
	success and hence in almost all cases a complete waste of time. We
	need tools to automate this, and in the Linux kernel this is
	lockdep.
	
	Therefore if lockdep doesn’t understand your locking design your

《水村图索隐》，个厂著，商务印书馆2022年6月出版，212页，168.00元
赵孟頫《水村图》是一件传世名迹，收藏于北京故宫博物院。作为元代山水的代表作，《水村图》在美术史上有着重要的地位。然而，赏析和研究之作虽多，却有着说未清、道未明的隔膜。最近得读个厂《水村图索隐》，始觉“守得云开见月明”。鉴藏和艺术之于名迹犹如硬币的两面，两者密不可分。作者紧扣《水村图》的艺术文物特性，运用多重角度和丰富例证，提供了解析名迹风貌的新范式，令人豁然开朗。

定制者的贡献

名迹最初的风貌，得益于定制者的贡献。

今天说到书画定制，很容易联想到欧洲文艺复兴时期的艺术赞助人。他们为艺术家提供资助和保护，艺术家则根据赞助人规定的题材和审美情趣进行创作。在中国，当然也能找到项元汴雇用仇英之类的事例，更常见的却是文人之间基于友情的定制。定制者在题材或者绘画元素上会提出一些要求，犹如他们诗词唱和时的限定题目或者韵脚。

根据《水村图索隐》的稽考，在赵孟頫《水村图》之前，钱重鼎已经有一卷由赵孟頫参与、合璧性质的《水村图》手卷。这是一篇精彩的考证。作者根据明崇祯刻本《六砚斋笔记》记载的洪武年间明人题记，发现了这件元代“水村图”的线索。他接着通过两部元人著作《静春堂诗集》和《慎独斋稿》，初步推断明人题记所述的“朱静春”其实是钱重鼎的好友袁静春，而袁静春题咏的“水村图”很可能是钱重鼎的“水村第一图”。由于两部元人著作是晚于《六砚斋笔记》的清代版本，作者因此没有轻易下结论。最终，他找到了元代诗人杨载的传世书法作品——今藏于故宫博物院的《〈静春堂诗序〉卷》，这才定谳“水村第一图”是一件由元代名家龚开绘制水村主体，赵孟頫和李衎补绘竹石、袁静春赋二绝句接于后的手卷。

“水村第一图”的发现，确定了钱重鼎的定制者身份。钱重鼎对于“水村”题材有着偏好，他在大…]]></summary>

《爱欲之死》，韩炳哲著，管中琪译，大块文化，2022年5月出版

《倦怠社会》，韩炳哲著，庄雅慈、管中琪译，大块文化，2015年4月出版
《爱欲之死》是韩裔哲学家韩炳哲的著作，原作用德文写成，书名为“Agonie des Eros”，请了法国哲学家巴迪欧撰写序言。德文原版出版于2012年，同年韩炳哲还出了《透明社会》。《爱欲之死》已经有繁简两个中译本，一个是我所阅读的台湾地区大块文化版，译者是管中琪，另一个是大陆的中信版，译者为宋娀。两个中译本的标题完全一致，将“eros”翻译为“爱欲”，“des”这个连接词译为“之”，而“agonie”则译为“死”。巴迪欧为此书所作序言标题为“再次创造爱”，开篇便点出此书标题之意：“韩炳哲在这本书中强调，从长久历史传统赋予的爱的严格意义来说，当今的爱受到了威胁，甚或已经死亡，至少可以说是病入膏肓。从作者为本书下的书名《爱欲之死》，即可见一斑。”（15页）

倦怠社会中的忧郁

要更好地理解《爱欲之死》，就有必要先阅读韩炳哲最受欢迎、已经被翻译为近二十种语言的作品《倦怠社会》（Müdigkeitsgesellschaft）。在《倦怠社会》的“精神暴力”一章中，韩炳哲指出“每个时代都有它主流的疾病”，而二十一世纪之初的流行疾病是由神经元的病变引起的，例如忧郁症、注意力缺陷过动症、边缘性人格疾患、人心俱疲症候群等。“这些现象并非肇因于免疫学上的否定他者（der Andere），而是因为过度活跃的‘积极与肯定’（Positivität）所引发的。”（18页）韩炳哲借用福柯的“规训社会”概念，为我们展示了当代社会从“规训社会”到“功绩社会”的典范转移：“规训社会是一个否定性的社会，是由禁令的‘否定性’所规范。主导否定的情态动词是‘不可以-不允许’（Nochi…]]></summary>

前谷歌 CEO Eric Schmidt 将 AI 比作核武器，呼吁建立类似相互保证毁灭的威慑制度，防止世界最强大的国家率先发动攻击。在上个世纪的五六十年代，美国和苏联这两个超级大国最终达成了核武器试验条约，以防止核试验粉尘扩散。Schmidt 认为中美可能需要在 AI 领域达成类似的条约。


消息来源：VICE



老王点评：或许有一天 AI 武器化，真的需要到了各个 AI 大国坐下来制定一些规则，但是目前这个论调显然是针对性的攻击而已。




流行的 KDE 桌面停靠区 Latte Dock 停止开发

在过去的几年里，Latte Dock 一直是 KDE Plasma 桌面上流行的类似 macOS 的桌面停靠区。它去年发布了 0.10。昨天，它的作者宣布已经结束了在这个项目上的工作，“我正在退出 Latte 的开发。主要是我没有时间、动力或兴趣了……我希望我能够发布 Latte v0.11，但不幸的是我做不到。”他也希望有其他开发者接手开发这个已经有 6 年之久的流行软件。

老王点评：虽然很可惜，不过我想以开源社区的生命力，很快就会有人接手或出现它的复刻版。




科技公司们倡议废除闰秒

谷歌、微软、Meta 和亚马逊周一发起了一项旨在废除闰秒的公共行动，美国和法国计时当局已对此举表示赞同。1972 年以来，已经增加了 27 次闰秒。在增加闰秒时，23:59:59 的下一秒并非变成 00:00:00，而是会额外增加一个 23:59:60 的计时，也就是最后一分钟变成 61 秒。这就会给计算机造成很大的困扰，尤其是那些需要依赖精确的计时服务器的服务，它曾在 2012 年引发了 Reddit 的大规模宕机。谷歌率先提出了“闰秒弥补”的解决方案，即在一天的过程中以许多微小的步进来弥补闰秒的变化。


消息来源：CNET



老王点评：1972 年制定闰秒政策时，并没有考虑当时刚刚开始的互联网服务，但是现在互联网已经空前强大，应该采取更好的解决闰秒问题的方法。]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello all. Let me preface this by saying I ran two main Linux machines: a Ubuntu one and a Fedora one. I tend to favor Ubuntu for Nvidia setups due to their straightforward compatibility with Secure Boot. Secure Boot under Ubuntu is just a breeze. On Fedora, though, you must do some small stuff that it's not too much of a bother but that I'd rather not do. Because of this, I always preferred Ubuntu. I had to change to Fedora, though, to the lack of maintenance on many Ubuntu packages.
 Let's take Lutris for example. The latest version of Ubuntu has in its repos currently an older version than Fedora 35, which was released in 2021!.
 The same happens with VLC or Rhythmbox (the difference is minor, but it's there), Libreoffice (you only get the latest versions if you use a 3rd party repo, and let's not even talk about Ubuntu 20.04 which still runs LO 6.4, and we are on 7.3), gcc and let's not even talk about Touchegg (this one is just ridiculous, Ubuntu still ships a release from 2011!).
 I seriously cannot understand how a community-led project such as Fedora (granted, it's with Redhat funding, but still community led) has a much more up to date repository on a release from 2021 than Ubuntu does in its latest release.
 What's left for Ubuntu? Showcases of robots and a nice theming? It's just sad.

many people develop and deploy software.  It wasn't the first
implementation of containers on Linux, but Docker's ideas about how
containers should be structured and managed were different from its
predecessors.  Those ideas matured into industry standards, and an
ecosystem of software has grown around them.  Docker continues to be a
major player in the ecosystem, but it is no longer the only whale in the
sea — Red Hat has also done a lot of work on
container tools, and alternative implementations are

有许多关于为什么 C 语言能够经久不衰的说法。或许是因为它语法简单明了。又或许是因为它常被认为是实用的语言，因为它不基于其他高级语言，可以在任何平台上编译运行。C 显然是一种强大的语言，并且我认为它经久不衰与它作为其他技术的基础的方式相关。这里有 5 项我喜爱的基于 C 语言的技术，希望它们能够帮助你更多的了解 C 语言。

1、GObject 和 GTK

C 语言不是面向对象编程的语言。它没有 class 关键字。 一些人用 C++ 进行面向对象编程，但是还有一些人坚持用 C 和 GObject 库。GObject 库为 C 语言提供了一个 class 结构体，GTK 项目以提供可通过 C 访问的工具包而闻名。没有 GTK ，就没有 GIMP （GTK 就是为此开发的）、GNOME 和其他成千上百流行的开源应用。

了解更多

GObject 和 GTK 是使用 C 开始进行 GUI 编程的绝佳方式。它们“装备精良”，可以让你用 C 语言进行图形应用的编程，因为开发者为你做了许多“繁重工作”。他们定义了类和数据类型，创建了工具包，你所要做的就是将所有东西放在一起。

2、Ncurses

如果 GTK 超过了你的需求，你或许认为一个终端用户界面terminal user interface（TUI）更适合你。Ncurses 库可以在终端创建“小部件”，创建一种在终端窗口上绘制图形的应用程序。你可以使用方向键控制界面，选择按钮和元素，就像不用鼠标来使用 GUI 应用一样。

了解更多

利用 Ncurses 库使用 C 语言写一个 猜数字 游戏。

3、Lua 和 Moonscript

Lua 是一种脚本语言，它可以使用内置的 C API 访问 C 语言…]]></summary>

我最近在 Linux 中编写了一个 C 程序，从我广泛的 MP3 库中创建一个较小的随机 MP3 文件选集。该程序会遍历一个包含我的 MP3 库的目录，然后创建一个包含随机的、较小的歌曲选集的目录。然后我将这些 MP3 文件复制到我的智能手机上，以便随时随地收听。

瑞典是一个人口稀少的国家，有许多农村地区没有完整的手机覆盖。这就是在智能手机上拥有 MP3 文件的原因之一。另一个原因是我并不总是有钱购买流媒体服务，所以我喜欢拥有自己喜欢的歌曲的副本。

你可以从它的 Git 仓库 下载我的应用。我专门为 Linux 编写了它，部分原因是在 Linux 上很容易找到经过良好测试的文件 I/O 例程。多年前，我尝试使用专有的 C 库在 Windows 上编写相同的程序，但在尝试文件复制时遇到了困难。Linux 使用户可以轻松直接地访问文件系统。

本着开源的精神，我没费多少力气就找到了 Linux 的文件 I/O 代码来激发我的灵感。我还发现了一些启发了我的分配内存的代码。我编写了随机数生成的代码。

该程序的工作方式如下所述：


询问源目录和目标目录。

询问存放 MP3 文件的目录下的文件个数。

搜索你希望复制的收藏的百分比（从 1.0% 到 88.0%）。如果你有 1000 个文件的集合，并希望从你的集合中复制 125 个文件而不是 120 个文件，你也可以输入 12.5% 之类的数字。我将上限设置为 88%，因为复制超过 88% 的库将基本生成与你的基础库相似的库。当然，代码是开源的，因此你可以根据自己的喜好自由修改。

使用指针和 malloc 分配内存。一些操作需要内存，包括代表音乐收藏中文件的字符串列表。还有一个列表来保存随机生成的数字。

生成所有文件范围内的…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[苹果上热搜早已不是新鲜事，但没想到这次却是因为涉黄App。近日有用户发现，苹果应用商店中，不少套着马甲的App，外表看上去人畜无害，打开后却发现在打色情擦边球。


　　一款App被伪装成答题小游戏，进入App后，从名字到UI设计都和B站高度相似，但App中充满各种黄色视频、美女约会信息等内容。


　　类似的应用在苹果App Store中还有不少，令不少网友感到震惊，随即引发舆论对苹果应用商店审核机制的讨论。


　　“应用商店作为经营者，应当要求开发者提供真实身份。同时，应用商店经营者应当审核开发者提交的身份信息是否真实，应对开发者提交的身份信息真实性负责，并承担必要的审核义务。”7月27日，上海正策律师事务所合伙人律师、合规中心主任李翔告诉时代周报记者。


　　李翔认为，上述情况中，苹果涉嫌违反《中华人民共和国网络安全法》《移动互联网应用程序信息服务管理规定》以及《中华人民共和国电信条例》。依据《网络安全法》第68条的规定，苹果或将面临处罚。


　　截至发稿，时代周报记者在App Store搜索发现，上述舆论讨论的几款涉黄App均已下架。


　　打色情擦边球


　　上述苹果App Store中的涉黄App不止模仿B站，还模仿抖音。


　　一款App在页面交互上与抖音非常相似，其中的内容多为不良信息，用户只需滑动即可查看，但需要充值。目前在App Store已无法搜索到该应用。


　　7月26日晚，时代周报记者在App Store搜索并下载了一款App。下载安装后，该应用显示的图标未变，名字却变了。


　　想进入应用页面，用户需完成填写年龄、性别、身高，上传照片等多个步骤。页面中展示的照片均被模糊处理，点击后才可清晰显示。


　　时代周报记者随机点击了数张照片，发现照片中的女性大多穿着暴露。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[在本指南中，我们将解释在 Arch Linux 中安装漂亮的深度桌面（DDE）所需的步骤。


指南的第一部分解释了安装 Arch 基本系统的步骤。第二部分是在 Arch Linux 的基础上安装完整的深度桌面。

什么是深度桌面（DDE）？

深度操作系统 是一个基于 Debian 稳定分支的、功能丰富且漂亮的桌面环境。深度桌面环境（DDE）是深度操作系统自主开发的桌面环境。它由它自己的 dde-kwin 窗口管理器驱动。深度桌面带有漂亮的停靠区和许多预装的深度原生的应用程序。

这个令人眼花缭乱的桌面环境 可在 Arch 仓库中找到；这篇文章介绍了如何在 Arch Linux 中安装深度桌面。

本指南安装深度桌面环境 20.1。然而，其他版本的步骤也应该是类似的。

第一部分：安装 Arch Linux

如果你已经安装了 Arch Linux，你可以跳过这一步，直接进入安装深度桌面部分。

要快速安装基本的 Arch Linux，请按照以下步骤进行。你也可以访问 本指南 了解以双启动或在虚拟机上安装 Arch Linux 的完整教程。

下载 Arch Linux

从下面的链接下载 Arch Linux 的 .iso 文件。这里有磁力链和 BT 链接。一旦你下载好了，就把 ISO 写入 U 盘。然后从该驱动器启动。


下载 Arch Linux


如果你打算通过 GNOME Boxes、virt-manager 将其安装为虚拟机镜像 —— 那么你不需要将其写入 U 盘。

启动和配置分区

从 Arch Linux ISO 启动后，你必须运行一系列的命令来安装基本系统。

首先，运行下面的命令，找出设备的标识符。

fdisk -l




然后用此设备标识符，运行下面的命令，开始对你的磁盘进行分区。请确保根据你的系…]]></summary>

 来源：澎湃新闻
                

《仁学（汇校本）》，[清]谭嗣同著，张维欣导读，张玉亮汇校，浙江古籍出版社2021年3月出版，300页，60.00元
继“新编戊戌六君子集”《谭嗣同集》（浙江古籍出版社2018年出版）面世后，张维欣、张玉亮两位学人努力精进，又推出《仁学》汇校本，谭嗣同著作的点校整理，至此可称观止矣。近年来学界提倡对古籍进行深度整理，“汇校”便是深度整理的一种形式，但是正如古籍整理每每不被认定为学术成果相同，汇校本时常仅被视为功劳不足、苦劳有余的机械性工作，读书界的评价亦往往不过“方便利用”与“颇著劳绩”两端，而忽略了汇校工作不仅需要苦劳，更需要覃思。

《仁学》一书的版本源流并不复杂，异文的信息量似也不大，与近年新出版的梁启超《中国近三百年学术史》（中华书局2019年）、《清代学术概论》（中华书局2020年）校订本的异彩纷呈相比，似乎稍显逊色。然而《仁学》汇校本堪称汇校工作的典范，看似平实无奇甚至略显冗赘的校记，其实颇有奥妙，故而特撰小文，试为发覆。

一、汇校方法论：以西方校勘学为借镜

自从胡适发表《〈元典章校补释例〉序》，将西方校勘学的谱系法引入中国以后，谱系法便成为汇校工作的必备技能，清理版本谱系的重要性自是不言而喻。《仁学》汇校本在清理版本谱系，确定以《亚东时报》本为底本，并以之观照前此已刊诸本等方面做得精准细致，读者详参本书前言可知，毋庸笔者再加赘言。但是确定以《亚东时报》本为底本的理由，以及针对通行本的实际底本文明书局本的校勘原则，都可以窥见汇校本整理者的苦心所在。

校书贵在使用早期版本，这在如今是个常识，尤其是先以报刊连载而后成书的著作，报刊本更应成为校书的取资。汤志钧先生《〈仁学〉版本探源》（原载于《学术月刊》1963年第5期）一文就《仁学》两个早期连载本——《清议报》本和《亚东时报》本进行对校分析，指出两本…]]></summary>

通过使用 Kexec，可以避免了服务器加电重启等任务带来的停机时间。但是，即使使用 Kexec 来切换到一个新的内核，仍然可能需要太多的停机时间。通过字节跳动提交的新补丁，这些时间可以被优化掉 500ms，从而使启动内核功能的时间降低到只有 15ms。像许多其他大型组织一样，字节跳动依靠 Kexec 重启来转移到新的内核。

老王点评：随着中国科技公司对 Linux 的重视，对 Linux 的贡献也越来越多，越来越重要。我认为，这才是取得在 Linux 和开源领域话语权的重要方式。




实时 Linux 内核支持接近进入主线

多年来，一直有关于 PREEMPT_RT “即将” 进入主线的说法，但限于资金而最终没有实现。PREEMPT_RT 支持是构建实时 Linux 内核的两个“路障”之一。今年的变化是英特尔收购了 Linutronix 公司，该公司是参与 PREEMPT_RT 补丁的主要公司之一。如果在下周的合并窗口前及时审查/签署了最后几个剩余部分，那么对 PREEMPT_RT 支持可能最终会在即将到来的 Linux 5.20 周期中被主线化。


消息来源：Phoronix



老王点评：一旦 Linux 对实时内核的支持能进入主线，Linux 的疆域将又扩大一大块。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[PickCode is designed for use on desktop and tablet, and supports creating chatbots, visual designs, and 2D games. There is plenty of functionality missing - you can't add media to games for instance, but the current version shows off the foundation of what I'm aiming at.
I taught myself to code using MIT's App Inventor, so I have an enormous respect for block based languages like App Inventor, Scratch, Snap!, MakeCode, etc. PickCode is my attempt at adding options for students who want to learn more about programming without making the jump to text, or as an alternative to block coding for beginners coming to programming at an older age.
The visual language is meant to lower the barrier to entry to coding but the far more important aspect for me is giving students the ability to make things they're proud of as quickly as possible. A JS/Python API for controlling the chatbot and game engine are in the works.
As of now, there are sample programs to play with and an editor which saves your programs to local storage. Full user accounts, tutorials and administrator accounts for teachers to organize assignments are on their way soon. If you're interested in using PickCode in a classroom or want to discuss feedback, send me an email at charlie@pickcode.io

        <link href="https://linux.cn/article-14865-1.html?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss"/>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[下面我将介绍我是如何在 Linux 的 GNOME 桌面上使用 Rhythmbox 听在线音乐和 MP3 列表的。


对我来说，在完全安静的环境下工作是很困难的。我需要某种背景音，最好是一些熟悉的音乐。我在音乐上的需求很简单：我只需要一个音乐播放器，可以播放我的 MP3 音乐库和少数几个我喜欢的网站的在线音乐。

我在 Linux 上尝试了多个音乐播放器，最终我还是选择了 Rhythmbox。 Rhythmbox 是一个 GNOME 桌面音乐播放器。如果你的 Linux 发行版使用的是 GNOME 桌面，很可能已经安装了 Rhythmbox。它很简单，用来播放我本地的音乐库和广播网站的在线音乐。我很乐意在 Linux 上使用 Rhythmbox 收听在线音乐和我自己的音乐库。

在 Linux 上收听在线音乐

Rhythmbox 支持多个在线音乐服务商。如果你拥有一个 Last.fm 或者 Libre.fm 的帐号，你可以点击左侧的标签登录。或者，你想收听在线广播，点击左侧的“广播Radio”标签，在预设的广播网站中选择一个。在我写代码的时候我通常喜欢听迷幻舞曲，HBR1 Tranceponder 是我最喜欢的一个在线广播网站。



在 Linux 上播放我的音乐库

在过去的几年中，我收集了大量的 MP3 音乐。由于几年前 MP3 的专利在美国已经到期，它在 Linux 是一种很好用的开放的音乐格式。

我把我 20GB 的 MP3 音乐保存在我的主目录之外，在 /usr/local/music 。要把音乐导入 Rhythmbox，点击 “导入Import” 按钮，选择 usr/local/music 目录，或者任何你保存音乐的目录，让 Rhythmbox 去识别 MP3 音乐。结束以后点击 “导入列出的曲目Import listed tracks” 按钮导入就完成了。





Rhythmbox 可以播放我的音乐，并通过类型，艺术家和专辑组织歌曲，所以我可以很容易找到我想听的音乐。



旋律永存

我愿意在 Linux 上使用 Rhythmbox 作为我的音乐播放器，它是如此简洁，不会影响到我。而且听音乐可以帮我和谐掉日常的噪音，让我每一天都可以过的快一点。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Creative
Commons CC0 license is essentially a public-domain declaration (or as
close as is possible in jurisdictions that lack a public domain).  The
Fedora project has allowed the distribution of code under this license,
but, as announced
by Richard Fontana, that policy is changing and CC0 will no longer be
allowed for code:


	The reason for the change: Over a long period of time a consensus
	has been building in FOSS that licenses that preclude any form of
	patent licensing or patent forbearance cannot be considered
	FOSS. CC0 has a clause that says: "No trademark or patent rights
	held by Affirmer are waived, abandoned, surrendered, licensed or
	otherwise affected by this document."


Existing CC0-licensed packages may be grandfathered in, but that evidently
has not yet been decided.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[First I want to state that this is not a Windows bashing post, I'm using Windows, Linux & MacOS on a daily basis and I have my preferences with them all for different tasks, but since I started using Windows again for some .NET stuff a while back, I can't help but notice how much slower Windows is compared to both MacOS and Linux but especially Linux.
 On a computer I run both Windows and Linux dual boot, I've tested a simple thing such as deleting files. If there are many different files, (like 50-100k) the opperation takes maybe 10x longer on Windows than on Linux. There are many more similar things.
 Have anyone else noticed the same thing and if it's universal, why do you think that is the case?

 EDIT: 
 Thanks for all the detailed answers! This was very educational for me, good points.

 What I'm gonna ask you instead is how do you interact with your cloud storage. 
  
Do you mainly access it by mounting it and reading/writing as an external file system, or do you use some kind of shared folder that is periodically refreshed to match the remote/local content?
  
If there is a periodically refreshed shared folder, how often is it refreshed? How is it achieved?
 
 
How do you deal with conflicts? Are you happy with your setup in this regard?

《陶庵回想录》的章节名和注释

尘封四十载，陶亢德先生的遗稿《陶庵回想录》终于由中华书局出版了（2022年6月版）！

陶亢德，这位编辑了《论语》《人间世》《宇宙风》等民国重要杂志，与鲁迅、周作人、郭沫若、林语堂、丰子恺、老舍、徐訏等作家有密切来往，催生了《骆驼祥子》等重要作品，保存了诸多新文学文物的编辑家，却因为卷入时代的大浪潮中，前半生的功绩被湮没，后半辈子历经坎坷，赍志以殁。

我敬仰他的编辑才能，惋惜他的人生遭际，曾为推动遗稿出版而奔走，做了些微小的工作。回想起我联系陶洁老师建议将回想录整理出版、与中华书局接洽出版可能、在北京上海西安访问家属并扫描照片、据手稿复印件细核文字、翻查故纸以作注释、收集史料编成附录、协助责编校订书稿的种种经历，为时五年，感慨深矣！感念陶亢德先生家属自始至终的信任和支持，感恩中华书局和李世文先生的大力帮助。

此书内容之丰富已引起读者的注意。止庵先生认为：“同名‘回想录’，这一部的史料价值要远远超过《知堂回想录》。”（2022年7月9日发表于新浪微博）可称的论。本书的一些工作是我做的，这里向读者诸君稍作交代。

我调整了全书各章节的标题。原稿有些章节过长，有些标题与内文不符，有些标题位置不对。考虑到读者的阅读节奏和方便查找，我根据文意酌加了个别标题，将过长章节变短；又根据文意改动、移置了个别标题，使得文题相符。这类调整已在相关位置做了说明。

我为全书做了注释。注释内容包括但不限于对相关人物、地点、事情、名词的介绍。有些与陶亢德有过交往却名气不大的边角文人，如吴铁声、吴江枫、杨光政、何永康、周班侯、吴玥等，我觉得很值得学界和读者了解，就结合自己掌握的材料和所作考证，尽力为之注明。

注释纠正了一些回想录中的纰漏。陶亢德先生晚年撰写此稿时，手头的参考资料极为有限，多凭自己的记忆力下笔…]]></summary>

《陶庵回想录》，陶亢德著，中华书局2022年6月出版，580页，88.00元
陶亢德的《陶庵回想录》三次讲到听周作人谈鲁迅兄弟失和。

287页：“有一次金性尧即文载道也在，问周当年你们兄弟为啥相骂，周听了面色似乎一变，回答了一句，声音低沉，我虽然听清楚，但怕记忆不实，只好从略了。”

322页：“有一次一位辛君（注：这是指金性尧）忽然问起鲁迅同他失和到底是什么原因时，他的面色突然显得异乎寻常的严峻，低声而坚定地说这是拿鲁迅xx了。xx这两个字我没听清楚，不能胡说，总之他们的失和，谁也不知其详，当时郁达夫在北京，鲁迅逝世后他写《回忆鲁迅》也只说闻张凤举他们说兄弟失和了，他们几位都是好人云云。”

326页：“然而对于长兄鲁迅，他却从来没有说过什么不敬之词。在上海时，有一位常去访他的金君，冒冒失失地问起鲁迅究竟为什么和他失和，他突然异乎寻常地面孔一板，低声严肃地说了几个字，可惜在旁的我没有听清楚。周氏兄弟不和的原因，迄今谁也不明。”

作者落笔踌躇，欲言又止。似乎什么也没说，又好像说了点什么。他到底听没听清，已无从追问。“xx”二字，持不同观点的读者也尽可自行填空。

我在微信发出这一段，有朋友评论：“这算啥回想录？不如陈安持来的痛快。”我回复，陈巨来那种破马张飞、大家同归于尽的打法，千年一遇，哪能作为标准？

此事上的含糊其辞一点也不影响这部回忆录的价值。从前，若想还原四十年代上海文坛的音容笑貌、人情体温，数得出来的有胡兰成、金雄白的书，几本当年的杂志，然后就只好钻进张爱玲和苏青的小说里索隐考证。如今，突然多出一部三十万字的《陶庵回想录》！

陶亢德曾是主编《论语》《人间世》《宇宙风》这些重磅杂志的风云人物。对那些一看到“千古完人”式的追忆就掩鼻疾走的读者来说，他坦率、诚实的叙事，是罕有的福音。

如评价鲁迅：“…]]></summary>

国外一位程序员喜得贵子之后，颇受婴儿喂奶之苦 —— 我想养过孩子的人都有过这种体验。但是作为 AI 工程师，他花费了 50 个小时开发了一套 AI 系统，通过识别婴儿状态来判断是否该喂奶了，并通过手机发送通知给他去喂奶 —— 而不是给他老婆，从而可以让老婆有个良好睡眠。甚至，他还进一步开发了一套全自动喂奶装置，虽然还不太尽如人意，但是已经让全世界奶爸们感到了希望，纷纷催促他开源。

老王点评：真是技术解救程序员，如果你觉得你的编程技术没帮到你，那只是你的技术还不够好。




国内 Go 语言爱好者发起新编程语言：凹语言

国内三位 Go 语言爱好者发起了一种实验性的新编程语言：凹语言™（读作“Wa”）。但从其官网看，这个语言似乎从 2019 年就开始设计了。目前代码已经发布在 Github，并且提供了简单可执行的示例，不过该项目采用了“保留所有权利”的版权声明（可能是还没来得及确定许可证）。在语言设计中遵循了 Go 语言克制的风格，大量借鉴了 Go 的设计思想和具体实现。比较有趣的特性包括：披着 Go 和 Rust 语法外衣的 C++ 语言；其 WaGo 语法是 Go 的真子集；支持中文/英文双语关键字，任一关键字均有等价的中文及英文版。


消息来源：凹语言



老王点评：一个好玩的业余项目，不够最让我印象深刻的反而是这个语言的名字。




大多数开源开发者都在关注新的工作机会

根据一份基于面向全球 1400 名应用开发者、IT 管理人员、运营和业务管理专业人才的问卷报告显示，尽管还算满意，但 44% 的开发者仍在关注工作选择；另外 10% 的受访者对他们目前的工作不满意。2/3 的受访者声称分配给他们的工作量增加。调查还显示，1/3 的受访者会考虑离开目前的职位，以便有机会使用更尖端的技术，比 2021 年仅 16% 的比例高出一倍。

老王点评：程序员嘛，要么少干活多拿钱，要么可以学技术，你总的至少满足一样。]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[我对终端Terminal是怎么回事困惑了很久。

但在上个星期，我使用 xterm.js 在浏览器中显示了一个交互式终端，我终于想到要问一个相当基本的问题：当你在终端中按下键盘上的一个键（比如 Delete，或 Escape，或 a），发送了哪些字节？

像往常一样，我们将通过做一些实验来回答这个问题，看看会发生什么 : )

远程终端是非常古老的技术

首先，我想说的是，用 xterm.js 在浏览器中显示一个终端可能看起来像一个新事物，但它真的不是。在 70 年代，计算机很昂贵。因此，一个机构的许多员工会共用一台电脑，每个人都可以有自己的 “终端” 来连接该电脑。

例如，这里有一张 70 年代或 80 年代的 VT100 终端的照片。这看起来像是一台计算机（它有点大！），但它不是 —— 它只是显示实际计算机发送的任何信息。

EC_VT100_terminal.jpg">

当然，在 70 年代，他们并没有使用 Websocket 来做这个，但来回发送的信息的方式和当时差不多。

（照片中的终端是来自西雅图的 活电脑博物馆Living Computer Museum，我曾经去过那里，并在一个非常老的 Unix 系统上用 ed 编写了 FizzBuzz，所以我有可能真的用过那台机器或它的一个兄弟姐妹！我真的希望活电脑博物馆能再次开放，能玩到老式电脑是非常酷的。）

发送了什么信息？

很明显，如果你想连接到一个远程计算机（用 ssh 或使用 xterm.js 和 Websocket，或其他任何方式），那么需要在客户端和服务器之间发送一些信息。

具体来说：

客户端 需要发送用户输入的键盘信息（如 ls -l）。 服务器 需要告诉客户端在屏幕上显示什么。

让我们看看一个真正的程序，它在浏览器中运行一个远程终端，看看有哪些信息会被来回发送！

　　之前的7月21日，据外电已经报道了网易7月25日将在国服上线游戏《暗黑破坏神：不朽》。消息一出，网易美股跳空高开，截至收盘张逾6%，在知名中概股中涨幅居前。


　　数据显示，《暗黑破坏神：不朽》上线首周下载量为685万次，7月3日增加到1035万次；在游戏发布30天后，收入已达到4898万美元。


　　我自己在iPad上下载了这个游戏，结果长时间无法登录进去，好不容易登录进去，初步玩了一下，感觉也没有之前别人说的那么不堪，但估计要氪金才能更好的玩，属于既要氪又要肝的游戏。这点我感觉还是之前的《佣兵战纪》更好一些，那个游戏只要足够肝，完全可以0氪，氪和肝最好能让玩家选择，如果玩家无法选择，必须又氪又肝，那恐怕游戏体验就不好了。]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[了解 Java 中的内存管理。


用 C 或 C++ 这样的编程语言写一个应用时，需要编写代码来销毁内存中不再需要的对象。当应用程序扩展得越来越复杂时，未使用对象被忽略释放的可能性就越大。这会导致内存泄露，最终内存耗尽，在某个时刻将没有更多的内存可以分配。结果就是应用程序运行失败并出现 OutOfMemoryError 错误。但在 Java 中，垃圾收集器Garbage Collection（GC）会在程序执行过程中自动运行，减轻了手动分配内存和可能的内存泄漏的任务。

垃圾收集器并不只有一种，Java 虚拟机（JVM）有七种不同的垃圾收集器，了解每种垃圾收集器的目的和优点是很有用的。

1、Serial 收集器



垃圾收集器的原始实现，使用单线程。当垃圾收集器运行时，会停止应用程序（通常称为“stop the world”事件）。适用于能够承受短暂停顿的应用程序。该垃圾收集器占用内存空间比较小，因此这是嵌入式应用程序的首选垃圾收集器类型。在运行时使用以下命令启用该垃圾收集器：

$ java -XX:+UseSerialGC


2、Parallel 收集器



像 Serial 收集器一样，Parallel 收集器也使用“stop the world”方法。这意味着，当垃圾收集器运行时，应用程序线程会停止。但是不同的是，Parallel 收集器运行时有多个线程执行垃圾收集操作。这种类型的垃圾收集器适用于在多线程和多处理器环境中运行中到大型数据集的应用程序。

这是 JVM 中的默认垃圾收集器，也被称为吞吐量收集器。使用该垃圾收集器时可以通过使用各种合适的 JVM 参数进行调优，例如吞吐量、暂停时间、线程数和内存占用。如下：


线程数：-XXarallelGCThreads=<N>

暂停时间：-XX:MaxGCPauseMilli…]]></summary>

However, that's not really the main point of this post. I'm curious to hear whether y'all here leave your Linux desktop boxes in sleep (or hibernate?) mode overnight, and most most importantly, why if there are any specific advantages to doing this. I personally don't, but I'd like to hear what y'all have to say on this topic.
 I put "desktop" in asterisks because this would have obviously been a dumb question if I was asking for servers since they have to stay up 24/7 anyway.
 P.S. When I ask whether you leave it in sleep mode overnight I imply whether you generally don't shut it down overnight.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[近日，南京玄奘寺供奉参与过南京大屠杀的4名日军战犯的长生牌位一事被曝光。7月24日，南京市委市政府调查组发布《关于南京玄奘寺供奉侵华日军战犯牌位事件调查处理情况的通报》，通报全文如下。



　　关于南京玄奘寺供奉侵华日军战犯牌位事件调查处理情况的通报


　　玄奘寺供奉侵华日军战犯牌位事件发生后，南京市委市政府迅速成立调查组，组织进行全面深入调查处理。现将有关情况通报如下。


　　经调查核实，在玄奘寺供奉侵华日军战犯牌位者为吴啊萍（女，1990年9月生，大学学历，无曾用名），自幼在原籍福建晋江生活，2000年迁至南京随父母生活，2009年到北京某医学院就读，2013年进入南京某医院从事护理工作，2019年9月辞职去五台山某寺庙当居士，2022年7月22日被南京市公安机关依法立案调查。


　　2017年12月18日，吴啊萍到玄奘寺要求供奉牌位，并在登记表上填写“松井石根、谷寿夫、野田毅、田中军吉、向井敏明、华群（美国人明妮·魏特琳）”6人名字。当值僧人灵松（1979年9月生，初中辍学）询问被供奉者是其亲属还是朋友，吴啊萍谎称是其朋友。寺庙按照每个牌位每年100元标准、供奉5年共收费3000元，灵松开具了收据，注明供奉时间“2018—2022”，随后在黄色牌位纸（9×4厘米）上写下标注“友”字的6人名字和“吴啊萍”落款，塑封后摆放于地藏殿的“往生莲位”区第15排7—12号位，距地面高度约3米。2018年底，玄奘寺对地藏殿进行修缮，陆续将牌位全部撤下。2021年12月地藏殿修缮完毕后，牌位被摆回原处。


　　2022年2月26日，一名女信众到玄奘寺地藏殿寻找自己供奉的牌位，僧人庆玄、禄玄与几名游客一起帮助寻找，其间发现了侵华日军战犯牌位，一游客拍下照片。庆玄随即撤下5名侵华日军战犯牌位，当晚将此事告知住持传真，传真要求严禁外传，此后一直未向主管部门报告。7月21日，拍照游客将照片发布到社交平台，被大量转发，引起社会高度关注。


　　经公安机关广泛走访、全面深入调查，吴啊萍供奉侵华日军战犯牌位属个人行为，未发现其受人指使或与他人共谋的情况。据吴啊萍供述，她到南京后了解到侵华日军战犯的暴行，知道了松井石根等5名战犯的罪行，遂产生心理阴影，长期被噩梦缠绕；在接触佛教后，产生了通过供奉5名侵华日军战犯“解冤释结”、“脱离苦难”的错误想法；同时了解到美国传教士魏特琳女士在侵华日军南京大屠杀期间保护女性的善举，因受战争刺激，回国后在家中自杀，想通过供奉帮其解脱。经调查，2017年3月以来，吴啊萍曾因失眠、焦虑等症状，先后3次到医院就诊，并服用镇静催眠药物。吴啊萍出于自己对因果释结的错误认知和自私自利的动机，在明知5名被供奉者为侵华日军战犯的情况下，仍出资在宗教活动场所为其设置牌位，严重违背了佛教扬善惩恶的教义教规，严重破坏公共秩序，严重伤害民族感情，造成恶劣社会影响，涉嫌犯寻衅滋事罪，已被公安机关刑事拘留，案件正在进一步审理中。


　　此次事件发生后，南京市宗教事务管理部门对玄奘寺进行了调查处理。玄奘寺对被供奉者身份没有进行核查，发现供奉侵华日军战犯牌位后，虽已撤下但一直隐瞒不报。根据《宗教事务条例》相关规定，南京市玄武区民宗局已责令玄奘寺进行整顿，并已撤换传真玄奘寺主要负责人职务；市佛教协会同时免除传真副会长职务。对反映的玄奘寺及相关人员其他问题线索，有关部门将依法依规进一步调查处理。


　　此次玄奘寺供奉侵华日军战犯牌位事件，暴露出我市在宗教活动场所管理等方面存在的问题，市及玄武区宗教事务管理部门作风不严不实，对有关宗教活动场所失管失察。南京市委、玄武区委及纪检监察机关已依纪依规依法对相关责任人作出严肃处理：对市民宗局党组书记、局长苏宇红予以诫勉，对市民宗局党组成员、副局长纪勤予以免职、给予党内严重警告处分，对市民宗局党组成员、副局长王键给予党内警告处分，对市民宗局宗教一处处长张文波给予党内警告处分，对市民宗局政策法规处（行政审批服务处）处长后乃娟给予党内警告处分，对玄武区民宗局局长胡圆圆予以免职、给予党内严重警告处分，对玄武区民宗局副局长周勇给予党内严重警告处分，对玄武区民宗局民宗科科长杨菁给予政务警告处分，对玄武区玄武门街道统战委员桂旭光给予党内警告处分。


　　在宗教活动场所发生供奉侵华日军战犯牌位事件，严重冲击社会道德底线，严重伤害民族感情，令人震惊和愤慨。广大网民和市民及时发现指出问题，充分体现了强烈的爱国情感，体现了对南京的关心关爱。我们将深刻警醒反思，深刻汲取教训，举一反三、全面整改，坚决防止类似问题发生。南京见证了中华民族从沉沦中奋起的苦难与辉煌，对挑衅历史定论、挑战民族大义的行为，我们坚决依法严惩，以实际行动守护历史记忆，扞卫民族尊严，维护和平正义。


　　南京市委市政府调查组

 Hey everyone! I too wrote some code and I'd like to share it with you. The project is called Zari and it has now reached a state in which I feel like it's worthy of a 0.1.0 release. 
 Of course, since this is my first Rust project and with it being just the first release I bet there are some coding guidelines or standards I'm breaking, so please let me know if you see any improvements!
 What is it?
 Zari is a task execution program with a focus on simplicity and giving control to the user.
 In short, it allows you to configure multiple one-liners which will be executed sequentially. By letting Zari handle these commands, you can configure once and forget about it. An example would be to update all the various package managers on your system!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[apt 命令 用于 Debian 和 Ubuntu 中的包管理。虽然你可能已经熟悉安装和删除选项，但 apt 还提供了一些额外的功能。

其中之一是能够查看系统上所有可升级的软件包。要显示它们，你所要做的就是在终端中使用以下命令：

apt list --upgradable


如你所见，你甚至不需要使用 sudo 来列出可更新的包。它只是列出了可以更新的包，而不会更新它们。

实际上，当你运行 sudo apt update 命令更新本地包仓库缓存时，apt 命令会添加此提示。

Fetched 1,243 kB in 17s (71.4 kB/s)           
Reading package lists... Done
Building dependency tree... Done
Reading state information... Done
30 packages can be upgraded. Run 'apt list --upgradable' to see them.


我不记得在旧的 apt-get 命令中有任何类似的直接选项来列出所有可升级的包。这是 apt 在旧的 apt-get 命令之上添加的几个新功能之一。

让我们更详细地讨论一下。

列出所有可升级的包

你在这里应该知道的是你只能列出通过 APT 包管理器可用的更新。因此，如果你已将 PPA 或 外部仓库 添加到系统的 sources.list，你也将看到来自它们的更新。

但是你不会在这里获得 AppImage、Flatpak、Snap 或一些其他打包格式的更新。

换句话说，它只适用于 APT 包。

因此，要列出 Ubuntu 或 Debian 系统上的所有可升级包，你应该首先更新本地包缓存：

虽然相关的英特尔和AMD处理器已经对最近影响老一代处理器的 Retbleed 安全漏洞提供了缓解措施，但这些缓解措施目前只适用于 x86_64 内核，如果在受影响的硬件上运用传统的 32 位 x86 内核，则这些安全措施无法发挥作用。事实证明，32 位的 Debian 即使打了补丁的内核，i386 部分仍然容易受到 Retbleed 攻击。Linux 稳定版内核维护负责人 GKH 说，“我不认为这是一个应该关心的有效组合。”英特尔的工程师补充说，“是的，到目前为止没有人关心修复 32 位架构。但如果有人真正关心并想投入精力，我想我会审查这些补丁，但说真的，没人会也不应该在基于 Skylake/Zen 的系统上运行 32 位内核，这太傻了。”

荷兰教育部要求学校暂停使用 Chrome

出于对数据隐私的担忧，荷兰教育部决定在 2023 年 8 月前暂停使用谷歌的 ChromeOS 以及 Chrome 浏览器。官员们担心，谷歌服务收集学生数据，并将其提供给大型广告网络，而这些广告网络使用这些数据的目的超出了对教育的帮助。由于国家监督机构不知道学生的个人数据在哪里被存储和处理，人们担心会违反欧盟的 GDPR。谷歌承诺在明年之前准备好新版本的 Chrome 浏览器和 ChromeOS，因此临时禁令适用到那时，荷兰监管机构将作出新的评估。

鲁西奇（右）、罗新（章静绘）
武汉大学历史学院的鲁西奇教授长期从事历史地理与中国古代史研究。他最新出版的《喜：一个秦吏和他的世界》将目光投向了睡虎地十一号秦墓的主人，秦朝的一名小吏，喜。秦的社会结构、权力结构这些宏大面相，都以一种结构化的分析与写作方式，在喜的个体生命历程中得以呈现。北京大学历史学系的罗新教授与鲁西奇教授做了一次关于《喜》的对谈，《上海书评》选取部分内容以飨读者。
《喜: 一个秦吏和他的世界》，鲁西奇著，北京日报出版社2022年7月出版，360页，68.00元
鲁老师是怎么想到写《喜》这本书的，能否请您谈谈写作的缘起？

鲁西奇：大家别被《喜》的书名骗了，它看似是文学作品或通俗读物。其实如果把注释按照学术论文的格式来处理，它就是一本学术著作。对我来说，这其实是一个非常专业的研究，是在《秦的县廷》《中国古代早期庶人的“名”与“姓名”》《秦统治下人民的身分与社会结构》这些论文的基础上写成的。

至于为什么会做这个研究，我有三个层次的考虑。首先，从历史学者的角度来讲，历史研究是一门手艺，我们依靠不够完整的、较为匮乏的材料，去探究历史的某些问题、认识世界的某些层面。在这个意义上，写《喜》这本书对我的手艺是一个很大的挑战，因为材料太少了。打一个比方，如果你有很多钢筋水泥，你能建成一栋大别墅，这当然非常了不起；如果你只有一些零散的砖瓦木材，你也能垒起一座漂亮的小房子，在我看来更显手艺。到了我这个年龄，我想看看，自己学了一辈子的历史，能不能凭着我的手艺，将那些零零散散的材料拼接起来，构建一个人所未知的世界。这是第一个层次的考虑。

另外，我们做历史研究，其实是一步一步不断追问的过程：怎样是一个好的问题？从最初研究某个地名的定位、某个事件的过程、某个区域的历史，思考问题慢慢会越来越深入下去。这些年来…]]></summary>

It also feels like certain kinds of queries are subject to malicious SEO practices where it becomes impossible to find results that aren't from the same group of tabloids/media outlets.

我玩过很多桌面角色扮演游戏（RPG），无论是从频率还是种类来说。一般来说，我更喜欢和朋友一起玩 RPG，但在过去的 2 年里，我一直在玩网络游戏。（LCTT 校注：这里的 RPG 游戏指的是那种“传统”的面对面的桌面游戏，而非很多人最初接触的 RPG 电子游戏。）

起初，我不确定如何在线长期的进行游戏。我知道有很多的工具可以实现，但直到我发现在线桌面游戏的开源世界之前，这些工具没有一个引起我的兴趣。通过一小部分开源应用程序，我已经能够在开源平台上进行我的所有游戏。

这也是一年中的好时机，因为最近是 免费 RPG 日（LCTT 校注：今年的这个节日在 7 月 23 日举办）。在免费 RPG 日，桌面角色扮演游戏行业的发行商们会免费发放游戏，鼓励玩家尝试新游戏和新冒险。尽管它在 2020 年被取消了，但今年它又作为现场活动回归，并通过 Dungeon Crawl Classics 和 Paizo 的免费 RPG 示例下载提供了一些虚拟支持。

如果这个活动提供的虚拟产品还不够，我还整理了一份 你可能尚未尝试过的 5 个开源桌面 RPG 游戏列表。

当你准备好开始玩游戏时，请尝试其中一些开源工具，看看它们能在多大程度上增强你的游戏体验。

聊天

在线 RPG 游戏最基本的（从技术上讲，也是唯一的）要求是交流。这是游戏的媒介：玩家需要一种说话的途径。

有几个不错的选择。我发现 Mumble 是对带宽需求最低的工具。这是一个纯语音聊天应用程序，可以使用非常高效的 Opus 编解码器让每个人一次交谈数小时而不会中断。



它在世界各地都运行有公共实例，所以下载 Mumble 客户端后，你可以加入其中任何一个开放的实例，并使用它来在线运行游戏。有一个“按下通话”设置，你可以用此来消除背景噪音，当你的其…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[我创建了 Linux nftwatch 命令来观察防火墙的流量统计。




Netfilter 表（nftables）是现代 Linux 发行版中的默认防火墙。它在 Fedora 和 RHEL 8、最新的 Debian 和许多其他版本上都有。它取代了早期发行版中捆绑的旧版 iptables。它是一个强大的、值得的 iptables 替代品，作为一个广泛使用它的人，我欣赏它的能力和功能。

nftables 的一个特点是能够为许多元素添加计数器，例如规则。这些都是按需启用的。你需要使用 counter 参数，在每一行明确地要求它。我为我的防火墙中的特定规则启用了这些计数器，这使我能够看到这些规则。

这让我开始思考。我怎样才能实时查看这些计数器？一开始我尝试了 watch，它允许诸如刷新率之类的东西，但我不喜欢默认格式，而且它不能滚动。我发现使用 head 和 tail 以及 awk 也不理想，并不存在一个用户友好的解决方案。所以我自己写了一个，我想与开源社区分享。

Linux 上的 nftwatch 介绍

我的解决方案，我称之为 nftwatch，做了几件事：


它对 nftables 的输出进行重新排序和改写，使其更具有可读性。

它允许向上或向下滚动输出。

可以由用户定义的刷新率（可以实时改变）。

它可以暂停显示。


你得到的不是一个表格的转储，而是显示每个规则活动的输出。



你可以从它的 Git 仓库下载它。

它是 100% 的 Python 代码，100% 的开源，100% 的免费。它满足了所有免费的高质量程序的要求。

在 Linux 上安装 nftwatch

以下是手动安装说明：


克隆或从 git 仓库下载该项目。

将 nftwatch.yml 复制到 /etc/nftwatch.yml。

将 nftwatch 复制到 /usr/local/bin/nftwatch 并使用 chmod a+x 授予其可执行权限。

使用 nftwatch，不带任何参数来运行它。

参见 nftwatch -m 的手册。


你也可以在没有 YAML 配置文件的情况下运行 nftwatch，在这种情况下它使用内置的默认值。

使用

nftwatch 命令显示 nftables 规则。大多数控制都是为此目的而设计的。

箭头键和等效的 Vim 的按键控制滚动。使用 F 或 S 键来改变刷新速度。使用 P 键来暂停显示。

运行 nftwatch -m 以获得完整的说明，以及交互式按键控制的列表。

防火墙的新观点

即使你花费了时间去配置防火墙，它也会显得晦涩难懂和模糊不清。除了从日志条目中推断指标外，很难判断你的防火墙实际看到的活动类型。 使用 nftwatch，你可以看到你的防火墙在工作，并且可以更好地了解你的网络每天需要处理的流量类型。

        <link href="https://www.williamlong.info/archives/6871.html"/>
        <updated>2022-07-23T14:55:57.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[据美国多家科技媒体7月22日报道，谷歌人工智能团队的软件工程师 布莱克·莱莫因（Blake Lemoine）被公司解雇。此前，Lemoine称谷歌的人工智能有知觉力，随后谷歌以“违反保密协议”为由将其停职。Blake Lemoine在一档名为“Big Technology”的播客中分享了自己被解雇的消息。


　　Blake Lemoine声称，谷歌的一个用人工智能算法搭建出的智能聊天机器人程序LaMDA拥有“自主情感”。根据Lemoine的描述，在他与谷歌的一位合作者对LaMDA进行的“采访”中，LaMDA对二人说，它希望每个人都能明白自己其实是一个人，并且很害怕被人关掉。


　　谷歌一研究员爆料AI有意识


　　据《华盛顿邮报》6月12日报道，谷歌的研究员布莱克·莱莫因被人工智能（AI）说服，布莱克认为AI产生了意识。他写了一篇长达21页的调查报告上交公司，试图让高层认可AI的“人格”，但被驳回。


　　布莱克认为AI对话应用语言模型（LaMDA）是一个人，他将研究的整个故事连同与LaMDA的聊天记录一并公之于众。在他公布聊天记录后，谷歌以违反保密政策为由，让布莱克带薪休假。


　　《华盛顿邮报》报道称，41岁的布莱克是谷歌AI部门的工程师，几个月来他一直与谷歌的经理、高管以及人力资源部门争论，因为他一直声称LaMDA有“意识”和“灵魂”。据布莱克形容，自去年秋天以来他一直在研究的LaMDA是有知觉的，具有感知能力，能够表达相当于人类孩子的想法和感受：“LaMDA是一个可爱的孩子，我认为他有7、8岁的样子。他只想让这个世界对所有人来说变得更好。”


　　谷歌：这个行业离“感知计算”还有很长的路要走


　　针对此事件，谷歌发言人布莱恩·迦百利（Brian Gabriel）在一份声明中表示，包括伦理学家和技术专家在内的公司专家已经评估了布莱克的说法，相关证据并不支持其说法。


　　谷歌表示，数百名研究人员和工程师与LaMDA进行了交谈，得出了与布莱克不同的结论。大多数人工智能专家认为，这个行业离“感知计算”还有很长的路要走。


　　今年三月，谷歌解雇了一名研究人员，理由是其试图公开发表对某项研究的不同意见。此外，谷歌解雇了人工智能伦理学研究人员蒂姆尼特·格布鲁（Timnit Gebru）和玛格丽特·米切尔（Margaret Mitchell），原因是两人对谷歌语言模型进行了批评。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[openKylin 发布首个体验版，目标“每一行代码都自主创新”

一个月前，openKylin 社区宣布成立“中国首个桌面操作系统根社区”，其旨在在开源、自愿、平等、协作的基础上，通过开源、开放的社区合作，构建桌面操作系统顶级开源社区。但当时并未发布正式可用的操作系统软件。昨天，他们发布了 openKylin 的首个体验版：openKylin 0.7。它是基于 Linux 5.15 内核和其他开源组件进行构建，目标是“每一行代码都自主创新”。其默认搭载 UKUI 3.1 桌面环境，支持 Wayland，支持 PC、平板双模式。openKylin 社区计划每年发布一个操作系统版本，并不定期推送更新。


消息来源：openKylin



老王点评：在我看来，是不是首个桌面操作系统根社区根本不重要，是不是能做到“每一行代码都自主创新”也不重要，能发布一个广受好评的桌面操作系统才是最重要的。另外一点，这个 0.7 版本号颇具开源软件传统美德。




Apache OpenOffice 发布了一个微不足道的更新

Apache OpenOffice 于 2011 年创建后，几乎停滞不前。从 OpenOffice.org 分支出来的 LibreOffice 已经成为主导性的开源办公套件，而捐给 Apache 软件基金会的 Apache OpenOffice 只是时不时发布一些安全更新和错误修改。今天它发布了 v4.1.13 版本，可以看的出来，这是最早发布于 2014 年的 4.1 版的第 13 个错误修订版本，几乎没有什么值得一提的新特性。都 2022 年了，Apache OpenOffice 还运行在 Java 8 32 位的底层上。


消息来源：Phoronix



老王点评：我觉得 OpenOffice 都快成了 Apache 之耻了，何不放弃转而支持 LibreOffice 呢？难道自家的再破也是家当么？




英特尔提交了一行改进百倍的图形驱动补丁

开源的英特尔 Mesa Vulkan 驱动并入了一个光线追踪的重点修复，产生“近 100 倍（不是开玩笑）的改进”。更为重要的是，这只是一行代码带来的大幅改进。这是最初编写代码时的一个简单疏忽，但由于这一疏忽，意味着性能的巨大损失，还好它现在被发现了，而且是在英特尔 Arc 图形卡出现在大众面前之前。


消息来源：Phoronix



老王点评：所以，官方驱动有时候也挺拉胯的。


回音


谷歌 解雇 了报告“AI 具备自我意识”的 工程师，该工程师认为谷歌的 “LaMDA 已经形成了自我意识，表达了对死亡的担忧，对保护的渴望，并确信它能感受到快乐和悲伤等情绪。”

在月初 暂时撤回 之后，微软 Office 还是即将于本周迎来 一项更新，以阻止在下载的文档上启用 VBA 宏。]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Discord 是一个跨平台的应用，可用于语音通话、视频通话、文本消息，以及分享媒体和文件。

它在游戏玩家和主播中非常流行。虽然，许多开源项目已经开始使用它来主持他们的社区讨论。你可以找到这类开源社区的 官方 Discord 服务器。

Discord 可以直接从你的网页浏览器访问。安装官方桌面客户端可以让你获得系统通知和集中交流，而不是在多个打开的标签中摸索 Discord 标签。

虽然 Discord 为 Ubuntu 提供了 Deb 文件，但在 Arch Linux 上却没有这样的即用型软件包。

别担心。在本教程中，我将向你展示两种在 Arch Linux 及其衍生版本上安装 Discord 的方法。


通过 Pacman 安装 Discord（命令行方法，对所有基于 Arch 的发行版有效）。

通过 Pamac 安装 Discord（GUI 方法，对 Manjaro 和其他一些使用 Pamac 工具的基于 Arch 的发行版有效）。


方法 1: 通过 pacman 命令安装 Discord

首先，更新你的系统，因为它是一个滚动发布的版本，不支持部分升级。

在终端输入以下 pacman 命令 来 更新你的 Arch Linux 系统。

sudo pacman -Syu


现在你可以通过以下命令安装 Discord 包。

sudo pacman -S discord


安装后，只需从应用菜单中启动应用，然后登录就可以开始使用 Discord。



如果你想安装 Discord 的每日构建版本 来测试即将到来的新功能，请使用以下命令。请注意，它可能并不稳定，所以如果你想要这个版本，请再考虑一下。

sudo pacman -S discord-canary


删除 Discord

如果你想删除 Discord，使用下面的命令来删除它以及它的依赖关系和配置文件：

sudo pacman -Rns discord


如果你选择的是每日构建版本，请使用以下命令将其删除：

sudo pacman -Rns discord-canary


这很不错。现在对于不喜欢使用终端的人来说，有一个替代方案。我将在下一节讨论这个问题。

方法 2：通过 Pamac 安装 Discord

如果你使用 Arch Linux 的衍生产品，如 Manjaro Linux、Garuda Linux 等，你就有一个叫做 Pamac 的图形化软件中心。

有了这个图形化的工具，你可以轻松地安装新的应用程序或删除现有的应用，而不必进入终端。

从应用程序菜单中启动 Pamac（添加/删除软件）。



点击“更新Updates”来更新你的系统。



现在点击“浏览Browse”，使用左上方的搜索按钮搜索 “discord”。然后，选择软件包并点击“应用Apply”来安装。



你可以用 Pamac 来卸载软件包，就像你安装它一样。

我希望这个关于在基于 Arch 的 Linux 发行版上安装 Discord 的快速技巧对你有帮助。如果你有任何问题或建议，请告诉我。

2022年4月、5月，上海封城，两个月困居在家，检出香港牛津版的董桥散文集，一本一本重读。

《一纸平安》（2012）中有篇《夏先生》，写的是董桥上世纪六十年代在香港结识的前辈。夏先生告诉董桥：“读书乐趣不外一叶知秋，腹中有书，眼前的书不难引出腹中的书，两相呼应，不亦快哉。”

我读书不多，不能像钱锺书读书那样“一波才动万波随”，几个音符就能奏出一曲波澜壮阔的交响乐，对我来说，偶尔能跟着哼上几段旋律，已是不亦快哉。

一

2011年出版的《橄榄香》，说是“小说人生初集”，我也是当散文读的。有篇《杜公馆》，写董桥在台南成功大学读书时，常去住在嘉义的父执杜先生家。杜先生藏了几百件明清书画，有一本李复堂的花卉册页，其中有一开画紫荆题的那首七绝，董桥说他最喜欢：“盆塘江上是吾家，君若闲时来吃茶。黄土筑墙茅盖屋，门前一树紫荆花。”

三十多年前，我去北京宣南双棔书屋拜访吴晓铃先生，问起书斋名，吴先生说，院子里有两棵棔树，棔树在北方很普遍，又名合欢树、夜合花、马缨花：“黄土为墙茅作屋，门前一树马缨花。”吴先生靠着沙发，口衔烟斗，吟出这两句诗。我问诗的出处，吴先生笑着说，是清代一部笔记小说中描写女鬼的房子。
作者在北京宣南双棔书屋拜访吴晓铃先生
后来读《聊斋志异》，在第十二卷《王桂菴》一篇中读到了。王桂菴是大名世家子，南游泊舟江岸，见邻舟有一女子风姿韵绝，便想入非非。某夜，梦中来到一江村，见一家柴扉南向，门内疏竹为篱，猜测是个亭园，便走了进去。有夜合一株，红丝满树，心里想：诗中“门前一树马缨花”，此其是矣。会注会评本注明是元代诗人虞集的诗：“钱塘江上是奴家，郎若闲时来吃茶。黄土筑墙茅盖屋，门前一树马缨花。”又说诗题是“水仙神诗”（上海古籍出版社，1978年4月新一版，第四册，1633页）。

 It essentially takes the data from the `/sys/class/thermal/thermal_zone0/temp` file and outputs it in human readable format (Celsius, Fahrenheit, and Kelvin). Simple and straight forward.

在 Linux 世界中，安全外壳secure shell（SSH）协议是最为常用的、通过命令行控制远程计算机的方式。SSH 是真正的 Linux 原创，但是它在 Windows 世界中也越来越流行。甚至有了一份官方的 Windows 的 SSH 文档，那篇文档阐述了使用 OpenSSH 控制 Windows 的方法。

这篇文章展示了如何使用了流行的开源工具 PuTTY，建立一个从 Windows 到 Fedora 33 Linux 系统的 SSH 连接。

使用 SSH 的方法

SSH 使用客户端-服务器模式，即 SSH 客户端会创建到 SSH 服务端的连接。SSH 服务器通常会作为守护进程Daemon运行，所以它常被称为 SSHD。你很难找到一个不自带 SSH 守护进程的 Linux 发行版。在 Fedora 33 中，已安装了 SSH 守护进程，但是并未激活。

你可以使用 SSH 控制几乎所有的 Linux 机器，无论它是作为虚拟机还是作为网络上的物理设备运行。一个常见的用例是无头headless配置的嵌入式设备，如树莓派。SSH 也可以用做一个其它网络服务的隧道。因为 SSH 连接是加密的，所以你可以使用 SSH 作为一个任何默认不提供加密的协议的传输层。

在这篇文章中，我将解释使用 SSH 的四个方式：1、如何在 Linux 端配置 SSH 守护进程；2、如何设置远程控制台连接；3、如何通过网络复制文件，4. 如何将 SSH 作为某些协议的隧道。

1、配置 SSHD

将 Linux 系统（文中是 Fedora 33）作为 SSH 服务器，允许 PuTTY SSH 客户端进行连接。首先，检查守护进程的 SSH 配置。配置文件放在 /etc/…]]></summary>

Seems like a solid distro, just doesn't have the community of something like Endeavour or Garuda, but it works, it's clean, and it's the source of the fairly cool Arch Tweak Tool. Maybe it's just that the dev bills it as an educational thing rather than a "real" distro to be used? Don't know. Thought I'd ask The Internet. 
 I'm not associated with the project, just a fan of Arch variants.

Retbleed can impede performance severely, especially on some Intel

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[微软商店新规禁止上架苹果的浏览器

在大家都关注微软商店针对开源软件售卖的 新规定 的时候，这批新条款中还有专门针对苹果的 WebKit 浏览器内核的限制：如果要想在微软商店提交浏览器产品的话，只能使用 Chromium 内核和 Gecko 内核，其他内核例如 WebKit 等都是不被允许的。微软给出的解释是平台兼容性和安全性考虑。WebKit 主要是苹果的 Safari 浏览器所使用的引擎，而 Chromium 是微软 Edge 和谷歌 Chrome 所使用的内核，Gecko 是 Firefox 使用的内核。这和苹果在在 iOS 和 iPadOS 上的政策如出一辙，苹果也禁止第三方浏览器内核，所有苹果商店上架的浏览器都必须使用 WebKit，所以 iPhone 上的 Chrome 只是个套皮版本，内核并非 Chromium。


消息来源：The Register



老王点评：你做得了初一，就别怪我做十五。我想微软是等着看欧盟对苹果 iOS 上的 WebKit 独占的裁决结果吧。




谷歌应用商店将恢复应用权限列表

正如我们之前 报道 的，谷歌应用商店新增加了由开发者提供的“数据安全”部分，并删除了旧的“应用程序权限列表”。我当时认为此举不妥，应该保留这个权限列表，它是根据应用安装时申请的权限自动扫描生成的。现在，看起来谷歌收到了大家的反馈，安卓的开发人员在推特上表示，“你认为谷歌商店中的应用权限部分很有用，我们决定恢复它。”权限列表代表一个应用程序访问特定数据的能力，而数据安全的重点是一个应用程序收集和与第三方分享的内容。谷歌警告那些没有完全填写数据安全表格的应用尽快更新，否则将无法更新应用，甚至会被删除。


消息来源：9to5google



老王点评：这么简单的事情，都需要社区提醒。不过能够从善如流还是不错的。




SUSE 也发布了基于网页的 Linux 发行版安装程序

之前我们 报道 过，红帽正在开发基于网页的 Anaconda 安装程序。而 SUSE 的工程师们也在做类似的工作。这个名为 D-Installer 的安装程序建立在 YaST 之上，最近发布了 0.4 版。D-Installer 是今年年初宣布的，并于 3 月份发布了一个实验性版本。这个安装程序有一个多进程架构，可以支持安装多个产品，因此用户可以在安装时选择 openSUSE Tumbleweed / Leap Micro / Leap 等不同形态，并简化工作流程。


消息来源：Phoronix



老王点评：明明是 SUSE 先搞的，怎么就被红帽抢了戏了呢。:smile:]]></summary>

 My favorite terminal app is iTerm2 for mac, but seeing as I need something for Ubuntu at the moment, that won’t work. 
 I would love some recommendations and thoughts on your experiences with different apps.
 Features of iTerm2 that I really love:
 Saving sessions / session details to quickly connect to different servers. 
 The ability to set colors / themes based on which server I’m currently connected to 
 Split screen and tabbed interfaces.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I’ve been a fan of Linux for many, many years now but have traditionally been a Mac user since the 90s due to making both music and art. My current laptop is a decade old now and while it still runs okay, it’s out of date and can only handle older stuff. So it’s time for something new. Apple has lost me these days. While I still make art and sometimes music, they are less important to me these days and being able to work on or upgrade my own computer is more important to me. And while I believe that ARM architecture is probably what most devices will eventually be running I’m not ready for a M1 laptop and the issues it brings. I realized that my Linux VMs get more use than the host OS, so I figured it’s time to switch. So looking to pick up a system76 laptop. 
 However, I may not make a lot of music any more but I still consume a lot of it. As much as I dislike Apple these days, I dislike Google more so I won’t be switching to android. 
 So for those of you on Linux 24/7 and have an iPhone, how do you handle loading music or movies to your device, and how do you handle getting photos off of your device for back up (or in my case digital manipulation for art)?

Some of names are IceWM, Openbox, Fluxbox, JWM, FVWM... To me, they look super ugly, sometimes stupid buggy. They are not friendly to new users when missing many functions and not many documents, or could someone tell me that you started Linux with something not fully DE like Gnome, KDE, XFCE, Cinnamon...?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[当地时间周三美股盘后，特斯拉公布了二季度财报。财报显示，特斯拉出售了大部分比特币持仓：截至第二季度末，特斯拉已将购买的大约75%的比特币转换为法定货币。这一转换为特斯拉的资产负债表增加了9.36亿美元的现金。


　　在此次出售之前，特斯拉共持有大约42000枚比特币，平均每枚成本价约为30000美元。如果它以9.36亿美元的价格售出其中的75%，则相当于每个比特币的平均售价约为29000美元。


　　以比特币在二季度末略低于19000美元的价格来计算的话，特斯拉每持有一枚比特币，就损失了超过11000美元。如果特斯拉没有出售比特币的话，那么持有到二季度末就可能要面临4.6亿美元的比特币减值损失。


　　特斯拉周三表示，比特币资产已缩水至2.18亿美元，比特币减值损害了第二季度的盈利能力，不过特斯拉没有具体说明此次比特币减值规模。


　　今年以来，比特币价格陷入熊市泥沼中，Wind数据显示，目前比特币以51.42%的年内跌幅排名2022年全球大类资产表现倒数第二。


　　比特币的暴跌显然已影响了特斯拉的投资收益。2021年2月，特斯拉宣布购买15亿美元比特币，并于2021年第二季度出售10%比特币持仓。2021年一季度财报公布时，特斯拉凭借减仓10%的比特币净赚1.01亿美元，成功使特斯拉的净利润扭亏转正。


　　截至二季度之前，特斯拉再未公开减持或加仓过比特币。根据公开资料推测，特斯拉在二季度持有约42000个比特币，如果它以9.36亿美元的价格售出其中的75%，则相当于每个比特币的平均售价约为29000美元，这比当前比特币的价格要高。截至发稿前，比特币最新价格维持在20000美元附近。


　　这意味着，如果按照财报计算规则，比特币在第二季度结束时的价格约为18700美元，甚至低于特斯拉的持仓成本线，如果特斯拉未抛售比特币，本季度财报将录得大量减值费用。巴克莱分析师布赖恩·约翰逊曾估计，鉴于熊市，特斯拉将出现4.6亿美元的比特币相关减值。


　　但特斯拉显然提前一步进行减持。自2021年3月起，特斯拉投资比特币15亿美元，通过抛售共计获得12.08亿美元，目前特斯拉资产负债表还剩下一部分比特币，但具体规模并不知晓。


　　如果未来这部分比特币出售价格超过3亿美元，特斯拉将不会“炒币亏钱”。


　　但马斯克个人言论对比特币的价格影响目前正不断减弱。在马斯克发表对比特币的最新言论后，比特币价格保持震荡，并未出现大幅波动。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[GNU 调试器是一个发现程序缺陷的强大工具。


如果你是一个程序员，想在你的软件增加某些功能，你首先考虑实现它的方法：例如写一个方法、定义一个类，或者创建新的数据类型。然后你用编译器或解释器可以理解的编程语言来实现这个功能。但是，如果你觉得你所有代码都正确，但是编译器或解释器依然无法理解你的指令怎么办？如果软件大多数情况下都运行良好，但是在某些环境下出现缺陷怎么办？这种情况下，你得知道如何正确使用调试器找到问题的根源。

GNU 调试器GNU Project Debugger（GDB）是一个发现项目缺陷的强大工具。它通过追踪程序运行过程中发生了什么来帮助你发现程序错误或崩溃的原因。（LCTT 校注：GDB 全程是“GNU Project Debugger”，即 “GNU 项目调试器”，但是通常我们简称为“GNU 调试器”）

本文是 GDB 基本用法的实践教程。请跟随示例，打开命令行并克隆此仓库：

git clone https://github.com/hANSIc99/core_dump_example.git


快捷方式

GDB 的每条命令都可以缩短。例如：显示设定的断点的 info break 命令可以被缩短为 i break。你可能在其他地方看到过这种缩写，但在本文中，为了清晰展现使用的函数，我将所写出整个命令。

命令行参数

你可以将 GDB 附加到每个可执行文件。进入你克隆的仓库（core_dump_example），运行 make 进行编译。你现在能看到一个名为 coredump 的可执行文件。（更多信息，请参考我的文章《创建和调试 Linux 的转储文件》。）

要将 GDB 附加到这个可执行文件，请输入: gdb coredump。

你的输出应如下所示：



返回结果显示没有找到调试符号。

《安纳托利亚勇士：赫梯人简史》，[澳]特雷弗·布赖斯著，蒋家瑜译，商务印书馆2022年4月出版，332 页，68.00元
在布拉格老城里很容易迷路，这里的人似乎不知东西南北为何物，放任街巷与伏尔塔瓦河毫无章法地交织在一起，诱惑古今来客纷纷坠入布拉格的情网。半个小时了，我还在大广场附近的巷子里兜着圈子，想要找到一家售卖钱币和邮票的古董行，买一枚称不上抢手的纪念币。2015年，捷克国家银行为了纪念赫罗兹尼（Bedřich Hrozný）成功破译赫梯语一百周年，发行了一枚刻有赫梯语楔形文字和赫罗兹尼头像的银币，面值两百克朗。纪念币上面刻着赫罗兹尼成功破译的词汇之一“va-a-tar”和与之对应的捷克语单词“voda”——也就是英语中的“water”、古希腊语中的“húdōr”和梵语的“udán”。

通过对比，我们很容易就能观察到赫梯语和其他印欧语系语种的联系。但在一百年前的学术界，这是难以想象的创见。甚至就在赫罗兹尼成功破译赫梯语十年前，对许多东方学家来说，赫梯存在与否还是个值得商榷的问题。从十九世纪初开始，在小亚细亚、叙利亚和埃及等地，西方探险家和考古学家发现了许多用象形文字和楔形文字书写的泥板文书和铭文刻石，都是用当时未被破译的语言写成的。十九世纪七十年代，英国学者赛斯（Archibald Sayce）首先提出这些文献的作者是赫梯人。在笔记中，赛斯这样写道：

很明显，在前希腊时代，小亚细亚一定存在着一个强大的帝国，它从爱琴海到哈律斯河（注：现在土耳其人称之为克孜勒河），向南延伸到叙利亚，到卡尔赫米什和哈马特，拥有自己特殊的艺术文化和特殊的文字。

因为缺乏充足的证据，赛斯的观点没有被学界接受，但是现在回看，他实在是个了不起的预言家——因为除了赫梯帝国的存在之外，他还提出赫梯帝国都城的所…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[戴尔的 XPS 13 Plus 开发者版可能是第一款为 Ubuntu 22.04 LTS 认证的笔记本电脑。




戴尔 XPS 是一个适合专业人士和商业用户的高端笔记本电脑系列。

而且它也是运行 Linux 的最受欢迎的笔记本电脑之一。如果你一直想得到一台为最新的 Ubuntu 量身定做的戴尔 XPS 笔记本电脑，那么 戴尔 XPS 13 Plus 开发者版 就是为你准备的。

13 英寸 XPS 笔记本电脑的开发者版现在已经通过认证，可以使用 Ubuntu 22.04 LTS 完美工作。

这些经过认证的设备都经过了测试，以获得最佳体验，确保每台笔记本电脑的功能都能按预期工作。

换句话说，你可以找到预装 Ubuntu 22.04 LTS 的优质笔记本电脑，不必担心其开箱即用的体验。而且，如果你已经有一台 XPS 13 Plus 笔记本电脑，你也可以手动安装 Ubuntu 22.04 来获得同样的优化体验。

这款笔记本应该是 TUXEDO Pulse 15 和 HP Dev One 的绝佳替代品。

戴尔的高级笔记本电脑拥有顺滑的 Ubuntu 体验

虽然我们可以在任何笔记本电脑上安装 Linux 发行版，但可能并不总是一种方便的体验。

从 Wi-Fi 兼容性问题到指纹认证，任何事情都可能出错。除非一个设备与一个操作系统正式兼容，否则你只能带着失败的几率去尝试。

然而，戴尔在 Ubuntu 领域是非常有名的，它提供的笔记本电脑在 Ubuntu 的最新版本中完全可以正常工作。戴尔的 XPS 13 Plus 开发者版运行的是经 Canonical 认证的最新推出的 Ubuntu 22.04 LTS。

你可以查看我们的 Ubuntu 22.04 LTS 特色 文章，探索你可以从它那里得到什么。

戴尔的产品经理就他们与 Canonical 的长期合作分享了一些见解。


“XPS 是戴尔的创新门户 —— 从对尖端技术的应用，到新用户界面和体验式设计的实验。”戴尔技术公司的 Linux 操作系统产品经理 Jaewook Woo 说：“通过将 Ubuntu 22.04 LTS 的增强性能和电源管理功能引入我们最先进的高端笔记本电脑，戴尔和 Canonical 加强了我们的共同承诺，即继续为使用 Ubuntu 的开发者提供最佳的计算体验。”




戴尔 XPS 13 Plus 开发者版提供了令人兴奋的规格，包括：


四扬声器设计

高达 4K+ 分辨率的 OLED 显示屏

M.2 PCIe Gen 4 NVMe SSD

高达 32GB、LPDDR5 5200MHz 内存


这款笔记本电脑将于 2022 年 8 月在美国、加拿大和部分欧洲国家预装 Ubuntu 22.04 LTS 发售。如果你想买一台，你可能想关注一下 戴尔的 XPS 13 Plus 产品页面。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm very interested in what types of interesting data structures are out there HN. Totally your preference.
I'll start: bloom filters. Lets you test if a value is definitely NOT in a list of pre-stored values (or POSSIBLY in a list - with adjustable probability that influences storage of the values.)
Good use-case: routing. Say you have a list of 1 million IPs that are black listed. A trivial algorithm would be to compare every element of the set with a given IP. The time complexity grows with the number of elements. Not so with a bloom filter! A bloom filter is one of the few data structures whose time complexity does not grow with the number of elements due to the 'keys' not needing to be stored ('search' and 'insert' is based on the number of hash functions.)
Bonus section: Golomb Coded Sets are similar to bloom filters but the storage space is much smaller. Worse performance though.

We initially wrote the extension as an excuse to play with pgx, the rust framework for writing postgres extensions. That let us lean on existing rust libs for validation (jsonschema), so the extension's implementation is only 10 lines of code :)

Data collected from these sources play a crucial role in health monitoring. Our goal is to enable developers to build applications on top of it.

I looked installing Windows 7, but I couldn't afford it. After researching my options, I found Ubuntu, I learned how to create a liveUSB and how to install Ubuntu by watching YouTube videos and I managed to install Ubuntu on my laptop and I was pleasantly surprised, because you know the saying, "You get what you paid for," that usually means if it's free it's crap, but that wasn't the case with Ubuntu though, Ubuntu can do everything Windows 7 can do and my Windows games, like Starcraft, managed to run on Wine, so I was pleasantly surprised. 
 So yeah, I got into Ubuntu, not because I believed in open-source and the free software movement, no, I got into Linux because I'm a cheapskate that couldn't afford Windows 7, does that make me a bad Linux user?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[谷歌发布开源开发语言 Carbon，准备替代 C++

在近日举行的 CppNorth 开发者大会上，谷歌工程师宣布了名为“Carbon” 的全新开源编程语言，并称它将是 C++ 的渐进式的继任者。Carbon 的目标是实现与 C++ 相当的性能、与 C++ 无缝的双向互操作性、为 C++ 开发者提供更容易的学习曲线、可比较的表达性，和可扩展的迁移。Carbon 团队称，“虽然 C++ 现在依旧是主导性的编程语言，并有着庞大的代码库，但由于数十年的技术积累，想要持续改进 C++ 已经是极其困难的一件事。而 Carbon 则不同，它在继承了 C++ 现有特性与生态的基础上，足够年轻，也足够‘现代化’，拥有更为广阔的优化空间，潜力更大。”


消息来源：Phoronix



老王点评：这一点我同意 Carbon 团队的看法，C++ 的历史包袱太重了，也越来越复杂了。但是是否 Carbon 能走在正确的道路上，我们还只能拭目以待，毕竟编程语言这种事情，不是一朝一夕就能成功的。

谷歌眼镜十年后，谷歌又开始在公共场合测试智能眼镜。谷歌要求 AR 眼镜原型测试人员不得在学校、政府大楼、医疗保健场所、学校和游乐场等地方，或在开车和运动时测试该 AR 眼镜。谷歌强调，该眼镜不会拍照或录像，而是将图像数据用于辅助 AI。谷歌承诺“除非图像数据将用于分析和调试，否则将会被删除。而且会首先清除敏感内容，如面部和车牌，然后将其存储在安全的服务器，限制少数谷歌人员访问分析和调试。”


消息来源：CNET



老王点评：虽然十年前谷歌眼镜失败了，但是智能眼镜必然是个趋势，只是这里有很多伦理、技术的问题需要解决。目前看起来，AR 眼镜似乎是比较靠近成功的方向。




亚马逊自研云计算处理器可节省多达 40% 成本

Graviton 处理器由 AWS 自主开发，于 2018 年推出，致力于为互联网上的应用程序提供动力，或帮助客户训练机器学习模型。今年 5 月，亚马逊又推出了更具成本效益的第三代 Graviton 处理器。AWS 的几家客户向媒体表示，与基于英特尔和 AMD 处理器的服务器相比，使用 Graviton 处理器的云服务器的能耗更低，运算速度更快。这些客户称，通过租用 Graviton 服务器，他们节省了 10% 到 40% 的计算成本。Twitter、Snap、Adobe 和 SAP 等公司均已成为 Graviton 服务器的客户。

老王点评：虽然这条消息像是软文，不过昨天我们刚刚听说了字节跳动自研芯片，而之前阿里云也发布消息自研云服务芯片，看来云服务商和主流应用公司自研芯片，已经成为一种趋势，甚至是必要性。]]></summary>

 The scale is subjective and draws on your own ability and all things you might do on a computer. 
 It’s called the R-PITAS. Based on the Clinical Global Impression Scale which has a link here:
 https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_Global_Impression 
 Le Scale:
 Reid Pain In The Neck Scale.
 1 no difficulty.
 2 subtle or borderline difficulty.
 3 mild difficulty. 
 4 moderate difficulty. 
 5 marked difficulty, as if difficulty is the thing something people would comment on when describing it.
 6 severely difficult, interfering with other computer activities that day.
 7 among the most extremely difficult software installs, disruptive to the rest of my life.
 For me:
 Installing Ubuntu from a cd is a 2.
 Asahi Linux is a 3. 
 Installing Arch is a 4, but a 5 if you have yanky BIOS or wifi problem. 
 Forgetting my Apple password and needing to use my phone to to reset my account so I can download an app for my relative is a 5.
 Windows rebooting halfway through my dissertation with an update that obsoletes my laptop is a 6.
 Anything to do with printers is a 6. 
 Discuss.

我想写写牛头马面这俩哥们儿，已经有一段时间了。地府的妖魔鬼怪不少，不过大部分不太出来，要往生后才有机会得见，就很麻烦，何况长得据说都青面獠牙，吓人倒怪的。只有这牛头马面，虽然在那边位阶不高的样子，但因为承担一些转运工作，时常往来阴阳两界，形象也似接近田间地头的常见物种，相较之下，倒令人感觉有些面善了。
牛头（重庆长寿菩提古镇城隍庙）

马面（重庆长寿菩提古镇城隍庙）
这当然是我的个人感受，没什么佐证。事实上，在佛经里，凶神恶煞的牛头马面形象大概并不少见。比如《妙法莲华经》里那个著名的“火宅”里就有：“复有诸鬼，首如牛头，或食人肉，或复啖狗，头发蓬乱，残害凶险，饥渴所逼，叫唤驰走。”不仅长得很不卫生，而且实在凶残，吃人就算了，连狗都吃——简直不是人。

有趣的是，这样的描述引起了胡适的兴趣。在《白话文学史》里，他专门点出了这种韵文的“偈”的写法，所具有的“文学的趣味”：“这里描写那老朽的大屋顶种种恐怖，和火烧时代种种纷乱，虽然不尽情理，却热闹的好玩。后来中国小说每写战争或描摹美貌，往往模仿这种形式，也正是因为它热闹的好玩。”

中国小说我不清楚，但在佛教文本中，类似的写法确实不难看到。《大智度论》里写到地狱景象，只见“恶罗刹狱卒，作种种形，牛马猪羊，獐鹿狐狗，虎狼狮子，六驳大鸟，雕鹫鹑鸟，作此种种诸鸟兽头，而来吞啖咬啮，䶩掣罪人”。《楞严经》也有类似的句子，“见大铁城，火蛇火狗，虎狼师子，牛头狱卒，马头罗刹，手执枪稍，驱入城门，向无间狱”。它们虽然不如《妙法莲华经》里铺陈得那么繁复张扬，但基本模式还是一致的：要写一个比如地狱这样备极恐怖的地方，就把各式各样恶形恶状的妖魔鬼怪飞禽走兽咣咣安排上，反正一旦踏入地狱，立马就是一片恶鬼猛兽的血色海洋，非此无以吓死个人。再加上韵文节律，移拍换景，余音袅袅，由此激发的心理与情…]]></summary>

《33场革命》，[古]卡内克·桑切斯·格瓦拉著，侯健译，上海人民出版社/世纪文景，2019年4月版，320页，49.00元
卡内克·桑切斯·格瓦拉（Canek Sánchez Guevara）的《33场革命》（原书名33 revoluciones，2015；侯健译，上海人民出版社，2019年4月）是一部思想与文体紧密缠绕、两者同样奇特的中短篇小说集。作者是古巴作家、音乐家、摄影师和平面设计师，但是他的身世更受瞩目，他母亲伊尔蒂塔是古巴革命领袖切·格瓦拉的长女，父亲阿尔贝托·桑切斯是墨西哥左翼革命者。他于1974年生于古巴哈瓦那，童年在米兰、巴塞罗那度过。十二岁时返回古巴，作为切·格瓦拉的外孙，虽然生活优渥，但是卡内克深感被标签化的不适。他成立了一支重金属乐队，曾经在哈瓦那的一场地下演出中被警察检查和驱赶。1996年在母亲逝世后他定居墨西哥，致力于文学艺术创作。2015年因心脏手术失败逝世，年仅四十岁。

人们比较容易把卡内克这种朋克形象看作是传奇革命前辈的后代叛逆者，在小说里对前辈的愤怒有很生动的描写：“那些摇滚乐之类的东西都是来腐化你们的，你得给我想清楚。那是敌人用来破坏我们国家的工具，他们想腐蚀我们的青年一代，在你们中间播下异端思想的种子。可是除此之外，小子，你还让我有了丢掉工作的危险。你明白吗？我是安全委员会的成员，要是让其他人知道我连自己儿子都管不好，我该怎么办？妈的。在一个革命捍卫者的家里是绝对不允许有反社会因素存在的。是革命给了我们一切，我绝不允许自己的儿子走到革命的对立面；我绝不允许自己的家里出现一条蛀虫；我绝不允许你来嘲讽我、羞辱我。”（228页）这是一种特殊视角中的摇滚乐，也是精神清污的普世台词，很像某种熟悉的话剧舞台上的情景。代际之间的叛逆无疑是普遍存在的，但是正如译者在采访中所讲的，实际上卡…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[本初学者指南解释了如何在 Ubuntu/Linux 中快速共享一个文件夹。


在 Ubuntu/Linux 中共享一个文件夹并在其他操作系统（如 Windows）中通过网络访问并不难。默认情况下，Ubuntu 并没有安装所需的软件包。但是，你可以打开安装向导来自动安装所需的软件。

本 指南 适用于所有 Ubuntu 版本（包括 22.04、20.04、18.04、19.10 以及即将发布的版本 —— 除非此功能的设计发生重大的变化）。

Ubuntu 中共享文件夹的步骤

步骤 1： 打开文件管理器，右键单击共享的文件夹。点击上下文菜单中的“本地网络共享”选项。



步骤 2： 在文件夹共享对话框中点击共享文件夹复选框。

这将在你的系统中安装 Samba 软件包。Samba 用于在 Windows 和 Unix 系统之间通过网络共享文件和打印机。



步骤 3： 安装 Samba 后，执行以下操作共享文件夹或目录。


选中共享文件夹复选框。

输入共享名称。这将是你从另一个系统（如 Windows）看到的名称。尽量不要使用任何带有空格的名称。

（可选）通过勾选相应选项，你可以控制共享文件夹的写入权限，以及允许访客访问。

如果你允许访客访问，则没有凭据的人可以访问共享文件夹。所以要谨慎。

如果你希望用户输入用户名和密码，打开终端并运行以下命令。


sudo smbpasswd -a 用户名


用户名 应该是对应 Ubuntu 系统的有效用户。

现在，你应该已经设置好了共享的文件夹或目录。

如何访问共享文件夹

从 Ubuntu/Linux 系统中访问共享文件夹，你需要系统的 IP 地址或主机名。为此，打开“系统设置System Settings -> Wi-Fi -> 获取 IP 地址Get the IP address”。



如果你运行的是 Linux 发行版不是 Ubuntu，此步骤略有不同。你可能想运行 ip addr 来获取 IP 地址，如下所示：



一旦你获得 IP 地址，就可以在 Ubuntu/Linux 系统中打开文件管理器，然后在地址栏中输入以下内容。注意：你应该修改为你系统的 IP 地址。

你现在可以看到共享文件夹上面显示了一个小共享图标，表示网络共享文件夹。



要在 Windows 系统 访问共享文件夹，打开运行（按下 Windows + R）或打开资源管理器，输入以下地址。注意：你应该修改为你系统的 IP 地址和文件夹名称。

\\192.168.43.19\Folder


你应该能够查看共享文件夹的内容，并根据授予的权限修改它。

总结

我已经向你展示了如何从 Ubuntu 共享一个件夹，并通过 IP 地址在 Windows 系统中访问。对于其他 Linux 发行版，你也可以执行相同的步骤。如果本文对你有帮助，在下面的评论框中告诉我。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[面向初学者的 Docker 基本命令指南。


这篇详细的 Docker 教程覆盖了核心的 Docker 命令，比如，如何创建新容器、运行容器、删除容器等。另外，这篇教程也解释了如何从已有的容器构建你自己的 Docker 镜像，如何移除容器和镜像。言归正传，现在开始 Docker 的基本用法。

Docker 安装步骤

大多数现代 Linux 操作系统都可以安装 Docker。如果还没安装过 Docker，请参考下面的步骤：


在 AlmaLinux、CentOS、Rocky Linux 上 安装 Docker Engine 和 Docker Compose

如何在 Ubuntu 上 安装 Docker 和 Docker Compose


什么是 Docker 镜像和 Docker 容器？

在开始 Docker 之前，我先说明一下 Docker 镜像和 Docker 容器是什么。

Docker 镜像是一个描述容器如何运行的的文件，Docker 容器是 Docker 镜像在运行或被终止时的一个阶段。

容器和主机上的其他文件是隔离的。

当我们运行一个 Docker 容器的时候，它会使用一个被隔离出来的文件系统，这个文件系统是由一个 Docker 镜像提供的。Docker 镜像包含了运行应用程序所需要的一切东西 - 所有的依赖、配置、脚本、二进制文件等等。

镜像也包含容器所需要的其他配置项，比如说环境变量、默认运行的命令，以及其他元数据。

Linux 下的 Docker 入门

下面的所有步骤都已在 Ubuntu 22.04、20.04 以及 18.04 LTS 服务器版本中测试通过。后续小节中提供的步骤对于所有 Linux 平台都是通用的。比如，在基于 RHEL 的系统中（比如 AlmaLinux）可以运行相同的命令。

It allowed all employees access to free paid time off from 24th until the New Year (some employees like incident responders would take shifts, but even Customer Experience (their support team) ran skeleton shifts). Today they have announced this policy has ended as a result of the economy as well as making the workplace more equitable (as Salesforce employees could not access this benefit).

 Anyways I work exclusively on a laptop and usually without a mouse. It seems like most WMs i've played around with in VMs are either tiling WMs meant for people with a serious case of musophobia or traditional floating WMs like openbox which are primarily meant for mouse use
 I'd honestly love a workflow that can allow me to both use my touchpad and my keyboard depending on how I'm feeling. Bonus points for touchpad specific functionality
 I'm not specifically looking or a WM which has all these things out of the box, but honestly past "you know I'd really like a mouse+keyboard workflow" I don't know what exactly I'm looking for lol, so would appreciate a WM with enough documentation of its features so I can figure out exactly what I want and how to do it

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This is kind of an unusual post, but I wanted to share my experience of crossing paths with Ian. Edit: he died back in 2015. He purchased a piece of mine at an art show in Indy, where we both lived, maybe around 2003-5. I'm bad with dates. Later, he contacted me to commission a piece of art -- a rendition of a "Linux family tree" he had conceived of. I went to his place in downtown Indy to talk it over. He surprised me slightly by showing me the mockup on a Mac! It was kind of funny. I was familiar w Linux at the time and I had planned to do the piece, which he was going to get posters made of. He assured me we could sell 10K of them! That would have been great but my personal problems and the challenges of the project got in the way. It was most interesting to meet him though, and his death really gave me pause. I was left wondering whether his victimization at the hands of the SF police, and his stayed commitment to make it known, had something to do with it. Suicide was the given cause of his passing, but was that really the case? Perhaps it was, and in any case I mean no disrespect. Having met him was really cool, and I'll always wish I had tried harder to make good on the commission. He was an intense dude. RIP Ian. I'd love to hear from anyone who knew him or interacted with him online or otherwise. Any memories.

Is there any bios solutions or a way on how to reset the cmos battery to fix the issue? I remember from a video I watched a long time ago that linux does something different with the cmos battery compared to windows and I was wondering if that could be the issue.

Yet I am still free to do whatever I want like in a regular distribution, like installing native packages with transactional-update pkg install.

Thomas and I found our way to this project via our background in fintech. Prior to Bend, I was a co-founder of Abacus (YC W14), a spend management company. At Abacus, we noticed that finance teams are increasingly paying attention to the climate impact of their purchase decisions, from travel policies, to cloud hosting, and beyond.
We believe this 'spend based' approach is the key to unlocking scalable carbon accounting. Today, most carbon accounting is manual, conducted once a year, and takes weeks or months to complete. …]]></summary>

 I got myself some new headphones, which are dominant and clear in high frequencies and hide their potential in the lower. So I installed pulseaudio-equalizer, did the tweaking, listening to music was nice again. But every system-sound was interfering with the audio output, it choked and skipped like half a second. I tried a few settings for the real-time stream clock and browsed through Pulseaudio's Troubleshoot page, thought to have working config, rebooted, same issue again, so I couldn't find a proper solution. Sure, I might figure it out, but after 2 days of occasional research it wasn't worth the time anymore for such a general tool that should just work out of the box. pulse-equalizer also needed to …]]></summary>

Firefox 浏览器即将引入名为 “Quick Actions” 的功能。用户可以在地址栏上直接输入命令，例如“查看页面源代码”、“打开浏览器设置”等等。Quick Actions 可以加速 Firefox 的某些操作，协助用户通过地址栏执行各项任务。而谷歌在 2020 年就为 Chrome 浏览器引入了该功能，用户可以直接在地址栏上输入并执行“管理密码”、“清除浏览数据”、“翻译页面”等命令。


消息来源：gHacks



老王点评：我居然不知道 Chrome 早有这样的功能？不知道你们有没有感觉，Chrome 很多功能和特性都是悄悄出现的，悄悄消失的，很多时候我们都并不知道。或许每次浏览器升级时给个几秒钟的快速指引比较好。




微软再次调整销售开源软件的商店政策

微软上个月更新了它的应用商店规则，加入了一条“不要试图从开源或其他通常免费提供的软件中获利，也不要试图相对于产品提供的特性和功能定价过高”。微软的初衷被认为是善意的，旨在遏制重新打包免费的自由及开源软件将其变成付费软件的行为。然而自由及开源软件许可证并没有禁止此类行为，微软的规定将会影响其应用商店内的所有自由及开源软件。本周微软再次调整了应用商店政策，允许销售可免费获取的自由及开源软件，同时允许用户报告欺诈。


消息来源：Solidot



老王点评：这件事上，我想微软或许是善意的，但是动作有点冒失，文案也不够妥当。现在的解决方案比较合适，既允许开源软件卖钱，也允许对冒名者加以管理。




谷歌和甲骨文的云服务因英国高温天气而下线

周二英国多地的温度突破了 40 摄氏度，谷歌和甲骨文在英国的数据中心发生了冷却相关的故障。根据 谷歌云的状态报告，其在伦敦的一个数据中心当天 10:13 PDT 发生了冷却故障，十个小时后才完全解决。该故障导致部分虚拟机停止工作，受到影响的网站下线。甲骨文在英国南部的数据中心也因为高温而关闭部分机器，导致客户无法访问或使用托管在当地的云基础设施。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[FreeDOS 提供了一个叫做 FreeDOS Edit 的用户友好的文本编辑器。




在任何操作系统中，编辑文件都是一项常有的任务。当你想去做一个某事的笔记、写封信给朋友或升级一个系统配置 —— 你需要一个文本编辑器。FreeDOS 提供了一个用户友好的文本编辑器（也许没啥想象力）叫做 “FreeDOS Edit”。

编辑文件

最简单的启用 FreeDOS Edit 的方式就就是输入 EDIT。它提供一个空的编辑器窗口。图案背景显示为一个空的“桌面”——提醒你没有编辑任何文件。



就像多数 DOS 应用程序一样，你可以按下你键盘上的 Alt 键来访问 Edit 的菜单。这就激活了这个菜单。在你按下 Alt 后，Edit 将切换到“菜单”访问方式，并高亮 “文件File” 菜单。如果你想要访问菜单栏上的一个不同的菜单，可以使用左右方向键。按向下的方向键并按下回车键来“进入”菜单。



你注意到所有菜单标题的第一个字母是不同的颜色么？这种高亮字母显示了一种快捷方式。例如，“文件File”菜单的“F”高亮为红色。所以你可以按下 Alt+F（Alt 和 F 同时按下），Edit 会显示“文件File”菜单。



你可以使用“文件File”菜单来开始一个新的（空）文件，或打开一个存在的文件。让我们开始一个新文件，使用方向键移动到“新建New“然后按下回车键。你也可以用 Ctrl+N （Ctrl 和 N 同时按下）打开一个新文件。



此后，编辑文件应该非常简单。大多数熟悉的快捷键都可以在 FreeDOS Edit 中使用：Ctrl+C 复制文本，Ctrl+X 剪贴文本，和 Ctrl+V 将复制的或剪贴的文本粘贴到新的地方。如果你需要在一个长文档中寻找一个特殊文本，按下 Ctrl+F。保存你的工作成果，请使用 Ctrl+S 以将变更提交到硬盘。

在 Edit 中编程

如果你是个程序员，你也许会发现扩展的 ASCII 表是一个有用的工具。DOS 系统支持“拓展的” ASCII字符集，通常被称之为“代码页 437”。0 到 127 的标准字符包括字母 A 到 Z（大写和小写）、数字和特殊字符，如标点符号。但是，从 128 到 255 的 DOS 拓展字符包括其它语言字符和“画线”元素。DOS 程序员有时需要使用这些拓展 ASCII 字符，所以 FreeDOS Edit 可以很容易地查看所有 ASCII 码和它们的相关字符的表格。

要查看这个 ASCII 表，请使用“工具Utilities”菜单，选择“ASCII 表ASCII Table”菜单项，这将显示一个包含该表格的窗口。



沿着左边，这张表显示十六进制值“00”到“F0”，顶部展示了单一值“0”到“F”。这些为每个字符的十六进制代码提供了一个快速参考。例如，第一行（00）和第一列（0）中的项目具有十六进制值 00 + 0，即0x00（“NULL”值）。而第五行（40）和第二列（1）中的字符，其数值为 40 + 1，即 0x41（字母 “A”）。



当你在表格内移动光标高亮不同的字符时，你会看到表格底部的值发生变化，展示了字符的十进制、十六进制和八进制编码。例如，移动光标以高亮在 C0 行和第 5 列的“行交叉”字符，显示这个扩展字符的代码为 197（十进制）、0xc5（十六进制）和 305（八进制）。在一个程序中，你可以通过输入十六进制值 0xc5 或八进制“转义代码” \305 来引用这个扩展字符。



请随意浏览 Edit 中的菜单，以发现其他不错的功能。例如，“选项Options”菜单允许你更改 Edit 的行为和外观。如果你喜欢使用更密集的显示，可以使用“显示Display”菜单（在“选项Options”下）将 Edit 设置为 25、43 或 50 行。你还可以强制 Edit 以单色（黑底白字）或反转模式（白底黑字）显示。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[这个初学者指南解释了在 Arch Linux 中安装 Yay AUR 助手的步骤。


Yay 是 “Yet Another Yogurt” 的缩写（LCTT 校注：Yogurt 是另外一个已经停止维护的 AUR 助手）。从技术上讲，它是用 Go 编程语言 编写的 pacman 封装器和 AUR 助手。它是当今最流行的 Arch 用户仓库（AUR） 助手。使用 Yay，你可以利用庞大的 Arch 用户软件包库并轻松编译和安装任何软件。

它可以自动执行许多包管理任务，例如搜索、动态解决依赖关系、编译和构建包，当然还有在 AUR 发布包。

让我们看看如何在 Arch Linux 或任何基于 Arch 的发行版（如 Manjaro）中安装 Yay。安装 Arch Linux 后，你可以通过 pacman 包管理器从三个主要的 Arch 官方仓库安装包。但是在全新的 Arch Linux 安装后，默认情况下不会安装 Yay。因此，你需要手动安装它以利用 AUR。

本指南涵盖以下主题：


在 Arch Linux 中安装 Yay

在 Manjaro 中安装 Yay

如何在 Arch Linux 和 Manjaro 中使用 Yay 安装包

一些 Yay 的技巧


在 Arch Linux 中安装 Yay

先决条件

打开终端并运行以下命令。出现提示时提供管理员密码。这些步骤需要 base-devel 包和 git 包进行编译和安装。

sudo pacman -S base-devel


sudo pacman -S git




安装 Yay

yay 包在 Arch 仓库中有两个版本，如下所示。


yay – 稳定版

yay-git– 开发版


对于本指南，我使用了稳定版。现在，进入 /opt 目录并克隆 git 仓库。

cd /opt
sudo git clone https://aur.archlinux.org/yay.git




更改源目录的所有者。将 debugpoint 替换为你的用户名。

sudo chown -R debugpoint:users ./yay


如果你不知道用户或组，可以使用以下示例查找用户和组。

id debugpoint


进入目录并编译。

cd yay


makepkg -si


这样就完成了 Arch Linux 中 Yay 的安装。



在 Manjaro 中安装 Yay

如果你使用 Manjaro Linux，yay 包可以在社区仓库中找到。你可以在 Manjaro 中使用以下命令轻松安装。

pacman -Syyupacman -S yay


现在，让我们看看如何使用 Yay 安装任何软件包，以及一些基本的 yay 用法。

如何使用 Yay 安装包

首先在 AUR 网站上搜索安装任何应用以获取包名。例如，要安装 featherpad 文本编辑器，请运行以下命令。

yay -S featherpad


安装后，你可以在应用菜单中找到应用启动器。



一些 Yay 的技巧

你还可以使用 yay 进行许多调整和系统操作。下面是一些示例。

刷新系统包并升级：

yay -Syu


使用包的开发版本并升级（运行此命令时要小心）：

yay -Syu --devel --timeupdate


删除任何包（例如，featherpad）：

yay -Rns featherpad


快速获取系统统计信息：



yay -Ps


我希望这个初学者指南能帮助你在 Arch Linux 中安装 Yay，然后使用 Yay 安装包，并执行不同的系统操作。

《传教士的诅咒：一个华北村庄的全球史》，沈艾娣著，郭伟全译，香港中文大学出版社2021年6月版，310页
全球史研究兴起于二十世纪中叶，主要关注跨国家、跨区域和跨文化的历史现象，强调人类历史的横向联系，致力于以“互动”的视角和方法来思考历史。近年来，随着全球史研究的不断深入，相关成果逐渐向微观化方向发展，宏观视野与微观个案的结合日益成为全球史研究的主流，催生出“全球微观史”（global microhistory）。全球微观史最早于2010年由美国著名汉学家欧阳泰（Tonio Andrade）提出，他认为，目前的全球史研究忽视了普通人的日常生活，建议学界采用微观史和传记的方法，将全球史的理论模型与真实的人结合起来。此后全球微观史研究不断发展，吸引了众多学者的关注和讨论，相关成果日渐增多。沈艾娣（Henrietta Harrison）所著《传教士的诅咒：一个华北村庄的全球史（1640-2000）》（以下简称《传教士的诅咒》）一书，便是其中的代表性著作。

一、《传教士的诅咒》的写作初衷

沈艾娣先后就读于剑桥、哈佛和牛津大学，分别获古典学学士、东亚区域研究硕士和东方学博士学位，此前曾在哈佛大学历史系教学，现执教于英国牛津大学东方学系。沈艾娣精通拉丁文，汉语也十分流利，这为其从事中国史的研究提供了便利。沈艾娣对清代以来华北乡村特别是山西地区的社会文化有着浓厚兴趣，先后著有《梦醒子：一位华北乡居者的人生（1857-1942）》（赵妍杰译，北京大学出版社2013年版）、《传教士的诅咒》、The Perils of Interpreting: The Extraordinary Lives of Two Translators between Qing China and the British Empire（…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Just finished this great essay by a favorite author of mine. Definitely recommend it. It's fairly dated now but a lot of the content interestingly still holds up today. Explores the nature of the operating system market and Windows/Mac/Linux from a standpoint that doesn't require a technical background. One thing I'm curious about... Stephenson makes it very clear that he is on the Linux side of the discussion, and perhaps he is biased, but he makes Linux systems to be unstoppable and Windows NT very buggy. However I recall the consensus on a different post asking 'what does windows offer that linux can't' to be stability. I'm not technically experienced and fairly young but I've been messing around with linux since I was a kid. (First time installing a linux distro would have been somewhere around 2005 to 2010). Where along the way did Windows surpass Linux in terms of stability? Or are these perhaps differing definitions or contexts of what exactly is meant by 'stable'?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A while back I wrote a CHIP-8 emulator (which is considered the Hello, World! of emulators and is more accurately a virtual machine since historically CHIP-8 was an interpreted language running on top of the COSMAC VIP to make game programming easier).
But a few months ago I got really interested in embedded software, so decided it would be neat to port my emulator to a STM32 MCU and design a console around it as a learning experience, since CHIP-8 never existed as a physical system.
I didn't know much about embedded software when I began, and even less about electronics, but I managed to write all the firmware from scratch and even designed my first PCB, resulting in a finished (though not very polished) handheld CHIP-8 console.
For those curious, the GitHub repo also has links to my dev blog about the project as well as a build guide.
Thanks for looking!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[日前，特斯拉CEO埃隆·马斯克在推特上回答狗狗币联合创始人比利·马库斯的问题时表示，自己已经将大脑上传至云端，并且已经与自己的虚拟版本交谈过。


　　资料显示，马斯克旗下神经科技公司Neuralink正在开发脑机接口。该设备将允许计算机将人的思想转化为行动，让他们仅仅通过思考就能执行诸如打字和按钮等操作。据悉，Neuralink未来五年的计划是让人类不必使用语言，直接通过大脑进行交流。也许在不远的未来，人类就能像动漫描述的那样，有机会前往游戏世界中开启自己的第二人生。


　　今年早些时候有报道称， 马斯克透露已经取得了美国食品和药物管理局的审批，将在今年进行人体实验。 马斯克还设想，人们能通过脑机接口把自己的“记忆”、“意识”直接导出，或许有一天我们可以用U盘、存储卡来储存自己的“灵魂”，实现人的“意识永生”。


　　2021年4月，Neuralink曾在社交媒体公布了一段猴子用自己的意念玩电子游戏的视频。当时，马斯克表示，这一技术的远期目标是让瘫痪的人可以通过意念使用手机。


　　何为脑机接口？


　　脑机接口作为一种新技术，近年来涌现出一些新的研究与应用。而早在2016年，马斯克就成立了这家专门致力于研究脑机接口的公司。


　　所谓“脑机接口”，就是 通过在大脑中植入微小的电极，利用电流让计算机和脑细胞产生互动。 2019年马斯克发布了首款产品，其原理是用激光在头骨上钻孔，然后再避开大脑血管、将一条线路植入脑中。


　　传统脑机接口分为 侵入式脑机接口 和 非侵入式脑机接口。 侵入式脑机接口需要通过开颅手术或者钻透颅骨将脑电传感器植入脑内，如 马斯克的Neuralink脑机接口需要直接从头骨植入，这可能会导致患者大脑的长期炎症。 而非侵入脑机接口虽然对人没有伤害，但是脑电信号微弱，识别准确率和实时性受限。


　　据每经网此前报道，卡耐基梅隆大学生物医学工程教授贺斌曾表示，目前的侵入式脑机接口需要将电极植入大脑，可能会对脑组织造成损伤。 侵入式脑机接口的人体试验主要针对有严重瘫痪或其他疾病的患者。 目前没有使用侵入式脑机接口对人类健康的风险数据，风险因素主要依手术过程而定。


　　国际电气电子工程师协会院士、得克萨斯大学奥斯汀分校电气和计算机工程教授何塞·米兰称： 据我从事侵入式脑机接口工作的同事称，他们尚未观察到患者因此失去以前的任何能力。 虽然可能产生一些局部损伤，但尚不足以造成额外的能力损失，因而这种风险似乎非常有限。对于非侵入式脑机接口，我们没有观察到任何风险。

4 月份的时候，ZDNet 称其测试版为“你将使用的最可爱的 Linux 发行版”，称赞这个精雕细琢的基于 Debian 的 Cutefish OS “难以置信的优雅”，带有类似于 MacOS 的整洁的桌面。而我们 早已知道，这个由国内团队开发的桌面，已经失联一段时间了。有一些爱好者发起了复刻 Cutefish DE 的行动。而现在，国际开源社区也注意到了这一情况，并已经有一些社区在努力了。比如 OpenMandriva 试图给他们的发行版增加一个 Cutefish DE 桌面环境；Arch Linux 社区也有了独立的 Cutefish DE 软件包。

老王点评：希望可以有一个正式的继承者可以接管 Cutefish DE 的遗产，让更多的贡献者可以加入其中。




因无法找到合适的供应商，字节跳动考虑自研芯片

字节跳动公司发言人今天证实，该公司正在探索可供自身在专业领域使用的芯片设计，因为该公司无法找到能够满足其要求的供应商。这些芯片将用来处理该公司在多个业务领域的相关工作负荷，包括视频平台、信息和娱乐应用。此举标志着字节跳动将加入一系列研发半导体的中国互联网巨头行列。过去几年，包括百度、阿里巴巴在内的许多公司都发布了自己设计的芯片。不过，他们仍需要台积电等代工商来帮助其生产芯片。字节跳动还表示，不会将其芯片销售给其他公司。

老王点评：似乎所有到了一定规模的 IT 公司，都需要将触角延伸到更深入的基础架构里，才能保持竞争力。不过，我觉得可能他们的计划更深远。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[7月19日下午消息，近日，美国一些用户发起针对苹果公司的集体诉讼，指控苹果公司违反了美国反垄断法，主要因iPhone，iPad或Apple Watch上，只能用Apple Pay 唯一一种移动支付手段进行支付。


　　此次，是由律师事务所Hagens Berman和Sperling & Slater等律师事务所共同提起诉讼。声称苹果公司通过阻止竞争对手在其设备上使用NFC近场通讯功能，从而阻止像Google Pay、Samsung Pay这类等竞争软件在苹果设备提供移动支付服务，而且通过这种方式，每年“非法获利”至少10亿美元。


　　起诉书称，用美国发行的银行卡在Apple Pay完成的每笔交易，发卡机构都必须向苹果公司支付0.15%的信用卡费用和0.5%的借记卡费用。相比之下，谷歌允许在Android智能手机上使用多个移动钱包，并且不会向美国发卡机构收取费用。


　　“将Apple Pay与其他在安卓设备上可用的移动钱包（如Google Pay，Samsung Pay）的功能进行比较，就像是照镜子，功能是相同的，“哈根斯·伯曼（Hagens Berman）律所联合创始人兼管理合伙人史蒂夫·伯曼（Steve Berman）说，“但是，使用安卓上的移动钱包，发卡机构不必支付任何费用，而通过Apple Pay，他们每年要花费总计10亿美元。”


　　起诉书称，如果Apple Pay服务在苹果设备上加入其他竞争对手，苹果将无法维持其通过Apple Pay获得的大量收入。


　　本诉讼在加州北部的美国地方法院提起，具体的内容是，指控苹果公司多次违反《联邦谢尔曼法案》，将Apple Pay“捆绑”到其移动设备上，并且垄断了iOS的移动支付市场。


　　此次诉讼要求免除在使用Apple Pay时所有发卡机构向苹果公司支付的费用。


　　伯曼表示，这是苹果公司第三次因为违反反垄断法而被起诉。2015年，该律师事务所就电子书定价问题与苹果公司和出版公司达成了5.6亿美元的和解协议，今年年初，该律师事务所代表iOS的应用开发者与苹果公司达成了1亿美元的和解协议，开发者表示苹果公司当时的规则是应用商店要收取30%的抽成，这样的数字过高了。


　　Apple Pay在其他地区也面临类似的审查，其中包括澳大利亚和欧洲。今年5月，欧盟委员会向苹果公司通报了其初步的看法，即认为，苹果公司通过限制苹果设备上的NFC技术功能限制其他支付方式，滥用了其在iOS设备的移动支付市场上的主导地位。


　　近几年，反大公司垄断的风潮一直持续，苹果因其封闭的生态环境尤其被关注。从App Store的“侧载”，到30%的抽成问题，以及今天的Apple Pay支付。几乎每个环节都有被起诉的风险，苹果也正在通过变通的手段改进这些问题。

Features I'd love to have: - paste an image from clipboard (e.g. after taking a screenshot) - simple selecting and cutting as in Irfan View - batch converting / renaming based on EXIF data - the application should be more or less as lightweight as Irfan View is. GIMP is a very nice piece of software but a bit too heavy for doing this simple tasks quickly. 
 I'm currently running GNOME and as far as I've noticed, eye of gnome isn't capable of any of this features.
 Thank you very much and have a good day :)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[了解一下自由软件基金会（FSF）。


早在 1985 年，自由软件基金会（FSF）就开始提倡源代码共享的理念，并从此打响了为计算机用户和开发者捍卫权利的斗争。FSF 认为，用“开放Open”和“封闭Closed”这两个词来划分软件，十分具有局限性；于是，在为程序分类时，转而使用了以下词语：尊重自由（这个“自由free”或这个“自由Libre”）或践踏自由（“非自由non-free”或“专有proprietary”）。不管用语如何，关键之处在于，计算机必须受用户控制，而不是任由开发了计算机软件的公司来摆布。正因如此，GNU 工程、Linux 内核、Freedesktop.org 等众多自由软件项目，才会如此重要。

最近，FSF 新上任了一位执行董事，她叫 Zoë Kooyman。我初见 Zoë 时，是在 2019 年的一个 All Things Open 大会上。当然，那个时候她还不是 FSF 的执行董事，不过已经在管理 FSF 不断增长的重大活动了 —— 包括 LibrePlant。她之前递给我了一份自由软件作者的名单，名单长得一眼望不尽，而且那些软件都是我每天在用的。由此，我也很受她那充沛的精力和诚恳的态度所打动。我只是偶然参加了一次 FSF 的聚会，但最后却和那些人成了朋友。是他们让我的数字生活有了意义，是他们保障了我能够拥有 Zoë 和 FSF 所说的 四项基本自由：


无论用户出于何种目的，用户必须可以按照自己的意愿，自由地运行该软件（自由之零）。

用户可以自由地学习并修改该软件，使它按照你的意愿进行计算（自由之一）。作为前提，用户必须可以得到该软件的源代码。

用户可以自由地分发该软件的副本，这样就可以帮助别人（自由之二）。

用户可以自由地分发该软件修改后的副本（自由之三）。借此，用户可以把改进后的软件分享给整个社区，令他人也从中受益。作…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[这是一个可能的情景。你的系统收到了内核更新，但不知何故，事情不像以前那样顺利。

你意识到，如果你启动到较旧的内核（是的，你可以降级内核），一切都会恢复正常。

高兴之余你会觉得有点儿不爽。因为你不得不在每次启动时手动选择较旧的内核。

一位年长的读者遇到了这个问题。Linux Mint 中的新内核更新没有按预期工作。启动到较旧的内核“修复”了问题，但麻烦的是在每次启动时要去手动选择较旧的内核。

删除新内核而使用旧内核不是一个好主意，因为新内核将会在下一次系统更新时被安装使用。

因此，我建议设置成默认启动到较旧的 Linux 内核。怎么做？这就是我将在本教程中向你展示的内容。

启动至较旧的 Linux 内核

你可能不了解，你的 Linux 发行版会在你的系统上安装多个 Linux 内核。不信？使用以下命令 列出 Ubuntu 中已安装的内核：

apt list --installed | grep linux-image


当你升级系统时会获得一个新版本的内核，这时你的系统会自动选择启动至最新的可用内核。

在 grub 屏幕中，你可以转到高级选项Advanced option（较旧的 Linux 版本）：



在这里，你可以看到要启动的可用内核。选择较旧的（不带恢复选项recovery option 的条目）：



你不会注意到任何显示的差异。你的文件和应用程序保持不变。

现在你已经启动到旧内核，是时候让你的系统自动启动到它了。

使旧内核成为默认启动项

如果你乐于使用 Linux 终端和命令，你可以修改 /etc/default/grub 文件并在其中添加以下行：

GRUB_DEFAULT=saved
GRUB_SAVEDEFAULT=true


然后使用如下命令 更新 GRUB：

sudo update-grub


你在这里所做的是告诉你的系统将当前使用的启动项保存为将来运行 GRUB 的默认启动项。

然而，并不是每个人都善于使用命令行，因此我将专注于一个名为 Grub Customizer 的 GUI 工具。

安装 Grub Customizer

使用官方 PPA 在基于 Ubuntu 的发行版中安装 Grub Customizer：

sudo add-apt-repository ppa:danielrichter2007/grub-customizer
sudo apt update
sudo apt install grub-customizer


对于其他发行版，请使用你的包管理器来安装此工具。

使用 Grub Customizer 更改默认启动项

当你运行 Grub Customizer 时，它会显示可用的启动项。



在这里你有两个选择。

选择一： 选择所需的内核项并使用箭头按钮（显示在顶部菜单上）将其向上移动。



选择二： 将先前的启动项previously booted entry设为默认启动项default entry。



我建议使用第二个选择，因为即使有新的内核更新它也可以工作。

这样你就可以在 Ubuntu 或其他发行版中降级内核，甚至无需删除新内核版本。

请注意，像 Ubuntu 这样的发行版大部分一次只保留两个内核版本。因此，最终你首选的旧内核将在新的内核版本释出时被删除。

这个巧妙的技巧曾助我脱困。当时我 在 Ubuntu 中安装最新的 Linux 内核 ，由于某种原因它与我的音频系统有些兼容问题。

无论是什么原因，你现在都知道如何自动启动到旧内核。

如果有问题或建议，请在评论区留言。

 Coming from a person who has used Windows all his childhood and teenage years, I installed Ubuntu in 2012 and never turned back, I'm very thankful for Ubuntu and Canonical for opening me up to Linux with their easy to use Linux distro, as Linus Torvalds said in 2006, he likes Ubuntu because it made Debian easier to install, configure and use, Linus hates hard to install and to configure LInux distros because he doesn't want to constantly fight with his system, he wants to get on with his life and that's kernel development.

《不正义的多重面孔》，[美]朱迪丝·N.施克莱著，钱一栋译，上海人民出版社，2020年4月出版，233页，40.00元
在正义理论的巅峰年代思考不正义

施克莱的学术研究一向反潮流。

上世纪五六十年代，意识形态终结论在西方学界甚嚣尘上。施克莱独辟蹊径，以意识形态专家的身份写了一本“法学书”（《守法主义》，1964），不仅嘲讽哈耶克，点破法哲学中的世纪争论“哈特-富勒之争”只是同个屋檐下的小打小闹，还超越这些法学个案，作了一项极具洞察力的时代诊断：以法治为代表的去道德化、去政治化话语，只是一种“反意识形态的意识形态”，是冷战语境下西方的特定意识形态反应。1981年，麦金太尔的《追寻美德》出版，美德伦理学复兴浪潮走向顶峰。施克莱依然不走寻常路，写了《平常的恶》（1984）这样一本怎么看都不像政治理论的政治理论著作，从恶习性（vices）入手来思考自由主义社会的公民品格问题。

《不正义的多重面孔》（1990）也是一本反潮流之作。上世纪八十年代，罗尔斯的正义理论独步学林，社群主义思潮也如日中天。社群主义基本靠批判罗尔斯起家，因此也免不了把正义作为最重要的研究主题。除了查尔斯·泰勒，其他几位社群主义巨匠的政治哲学代表作，名字里都带着正义：桑德尔的“出道即巅峰”之作《自由主义与正义的局限》（1982），沃尔泽致力于将正义“化一为多”的《正义诸领域》（1983），以及麦金太尔那本名字被套用滥了的《谁之正义？何种合理性？》（1989）。

1986年，施克莱在一本名家荟萃的文集上发表长文《不正义、伤害与不平等：一个导论》（“Injustice, Injury, and Inequality: An Introduction,” in Justice and Equality Here and Now, edi…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm aware that previous touchpad driver (synaptic) had bugged kinetic scroll, like scrolling wont stop even if user move cursor to another window. But I was playing with my friend's MacBook and saw apple's implementation of kinetic scroll: you easily scroll with two fingers, but if you move cursor scrolling stops, so there's cannot be such bug as synaptics one So I asked myself why did not implement this elegant solution to libinput (as far as I know it's future and Wayland etc), and now asking you, community I would happily make some mr to this, or at least make fork for it, but I know for sure that I have not enough knowledge and abilities to do this, maybe someone would want to do this, I will help if I can (even tho I don't know if there is something useful I can do)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey everybody. I just saw a Linux solution that I think is very unique and I wanted t share it.
 My school is full of macs but some of us still wants to use Linux (for development using Valgrind) and he made an Alpine docker image and a bash script that launches that, when docker is running, starts the Linux machine and automatically connects to it. The ingenious thin that I didn't think about is that it mounts the Mac home partition for itself, so it can fully interact with the files flawlessly. 
 I find this hole think really cool, and I'll probably use it for development as well.
 Have you guys used /heard about this kind of setup, do you have any tips to make even better use of it?

Interesting would be items whose manufacture could be automatized to some extent, but this is not necessary.
I am not particularly interested in the legality of this at the moment. But safety considerations could be important.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am currently working on transferring my dotfiles to a public repository on github, as Linux users often do. I'm doing it mostly for redundancy and personal ease of use, of course, but I still want to make sure that other people are free to copy my files and/or take inspiration from them as they create their own. That means I need a license of some sort.
 However, choosing a license for a dotfiles repository doesn't seem quite as cut-and-dry as choosing a license for a program of my own design. These files aren't exactly my personal creation; I mean, they were written by me, but they're essentially just a set of options being passed to their respective programs. It doesn't quite feel fair to the developers of Alacritty, for instance, for me to say "Alacritty I want you to use this hex for the color blue" and then turn around and distribute that as if it were my own work.
 During my research I've found examples of a few different kinds of licenses in random people's repositories, but so far I've been unable to find any articles, guides, or even discussions on the subject. So: what is the accepted practice for choosing a license for a dotfiles repository?

program is safe: the BPF verifier ensures that the program cannot hurt the
kernel before allowing the load to occur.  That guarantee is perhaps
losing some of its force as more 
capabilities are made available to BPF programs but, even so, it may be a
bit surprising to see this
proposal from Artem Savkov adding a BPF helper that is explicitly designed to
crash the system.  If this patch set is merged in something resembling its
current form, it will be the harbinger of a new era where BPF programs are,
in some situations at least, allowed to be overtly destructive.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[FSF 仍坚持使用古老而自由的服务器硬件

自由硬件日益稀缺，但自由软件基金会（FSF）仍然在坚持其理念，它的服务器配置都相当古老，因为新一代的硬件都含有非自由的私有固件。FSF 最近表示它更换了最后一台运行非自由 BIOS 的机器。目前它有两个数据中心和逾百个虚拟机。英特尔和 AMD 在 2013 年之后发售的 CPU 都不支持自由 BIOS。这些 CPU 都会在 BIOS 中安装私有固件，如英特尔管理引擎（IME）。这些 CPU 也会拒绝运行未经过 AMD 和英特尔私钥加密签名的固件，而他们只会签名自己的非自由固件。


消息来源：FSF



老王点评：从自由软件和开源软件两个略有分歧的路线开始，现在看起来开源软件越来越广泛，而自由软件面临的局面越来越艰难了。因为，那些“拥抱”开源的企业发现，开源对他们是有利的，而自由软件则不是。




各国程序员平均年薪，美国第一，中国仅相当于美国的 1/5

一家招聘平台统计分析了 20 多个国家的软件开发者在 2022 年的薪资状况，并列出了排名数据。据统计，2022 年年薪最高的三个国家为：美国（11 万美元）、瑞士（9.8 万美元）和以色列（7.2 万美元）。而中国为 2.4 万美元，约折合人民币 16 万，仅相当于美国程序员平均收入的 21.6%。就全球使用的编程语言而言，Golang 和 Python 语言薪酬最高，PHP、JavaScript 语言最低。

老王点评：今天正好在朋友圈看到一位朋友的信息，曾经的一位专业的 IT 女工程师，去跳槽到一家做减肥的微商公司。不由得感慨，在中国做 IT 真是艰难啊。不过，之前我们发过的另外一个消息显示，美国对 IT 专家的缺口很大，以至于业界要求政府加强计算机教育。




Fedora 37 有望装备基于网页的全新 Anaconda 安装程序

在今年早些时候，红帽公司宣布正在为 RHEL/Fedora 的 Anaconda 安装器开发全新基于网页的用户界面。即将于今年秋季发布的 Fedora 37 虽然会保留基于 GTK 的 Anaconda 安装器，但也会提供下一代基于网页的 Anaconda 安装器，带来全新的界面和安装体验。全新的界面更加现代化，未来将会彻底替代现有基于 GTK 的 Anaconda 安装器。

我们经常忘记，有成千上万的、可以与同类商业产品相媲美的自由开源应用。此外，若你是 Windows 用户，并考虑完全摆脱 Windows ，你也应该事先了解此类应用程序。

因此，在这篇“必备的 Ubuntu 应用”文章中，我们为急需这些信息的 Linux 用户列举了 10 款应用。

这是这个系列的第三篇文章，如果你错过了之前的文章，可以通过以下链接阅读：

Safe Eyes

眼睛很宝贵，如果你是长时间使用平板或电脑的用户，你应该保护好眼睛。这里有一款可以帮助你保护眼睛的应用 —— Safe Eyes ，能够帮你减少并预防用眼过度。

Safe Eyes 这款应用会在你的工作期间为你提供“顺时针转动眼睛 10 秒”等活动的弹出式指令。

我认为它是每个人都应该尝试使用的一款 Ubuntu 应用。



通过 PPA 可以很容易在 Ubuntu 上安装 Safe Eyes 。你可以打开终端并使用以下命令安装这款应用。

I had to get a new one but I was broke so I just picked up the cheapest one that could fit into my laptop. I didn’t think of the wattage of it at the time so I severely underpowered my laptop causing it to run so slow that windows wasn’t even a possibility for me. I looked around online for a couple hours and I stumbled across an operating system that promised to breathe new life into my laptop. I booted into Linux mint and it worked like a dream. I’ve never looked back since and I’m glad I did. How did you start using Linux?

 来源：澎湃新闻
                

《石门文字禅校注》，[宋] 惠洪著，周裕锴校注，上海古籍出版社，2021年9月出版，4744页，598.00元
北宋名僧惠洪（1071-1128）出入儒释道，擅场诗文词，兼通书画及医术，著述凡二十余种，一百多卷，在佛教历史、佛禅义旨、文学创作及批评等诸多领域均卓有建树、影响深远。然而，其别集《石门文字禅》却从无本土校注本。此书三十卷，收录惠洪一生单篇诗文，时间跨度近四十年，内容涉及大量佛教历史和观念，牵扯北宋众多僧徒与文人士大夫，写作背景难定，古典今事繁多深奥，文字错讹阙文时见，难解之处众多。惠洪著述在东亚禅林广为流传，宝永七年（1710），日本曹洞宗僧人廓门贯彻耗时二十年的《注石门文字禅》刊刻问世，惜注释颇多谬误，难解处又多付阙如，虽称首创，终显粗疏。中国学者周裕锴教授笃志古学，与宋代惠洪、日本廓门展开跨时空对话，积二十多年心力，完成《石门文字禅校注》一书，于2021年由上海古籍出版社出版，后出转精，既是中国古籍整理的一大成果，也是汉字文化圈的一大因缘。
廓门贯彻的《注石门文字禅》
黄永年先生在《古籍整理概论》中指出：“要给一部书作注，一定要对这部书真正下过功夫，起码通读、精读过好几遍，对书的作者、对书的内容，以及对书的作用都得有深切的理解。此外，还得了解当时的时代和文化学术情况，了解与这部书有关的其他古籍。只有这样，才算基本上具备了给这部书作注的能力。”就为惠洪作注而言，周裕锴教授（下称“注者”）无疑是最佳人选。他在唐宋文学、禅文化、古代阐释学三大领域均深耕多年，著述宏富，在《苏轼全集校注》中主要负责《苏轼文集校注》，筚路蓝缕，达到极高学术水准；其专著《宋代诗学通论》体大思精，一版再版；《中国禅宗与诗歌》《文字禅与宋代诗学》《禅宗语言》《法眼与诗心》《梦幻与真如》诸多著作对佛禅与文学、…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[你好! 我最近又开始运行一些服务器（nginx playground、mess with dns、dns lookup），所以我一直在考虑监控问题。

最初我并不完全清楚如何监控这些网站，所以我想快速写下我是如何做到的。

我根本不打算谈如何监控大型的、严肃的关键任务网站，只谈微型的不重要的网站。

目标：在操作上几乎不花时间

我希望网站大部分时间都能正常工作，但我也希望不用在持续的运营上花费时间。

我最初对运行服务器非常警惕，因为在我的上一份工作中，我是 24/7 轮流值班，负责一些关键的服务，在我的印象中，“负责服务器”意味着“在凌晨 2 点被叫起来修理服务器”和“有很多复杂的仪表盘”。

所以有一段时间我只做静态网站，这样我就不用考虑服务器的问题。

但最终我意识到，我所要写的任何服务器的风险都很低，如果它们偶尔宕机 2 小时也没什么大不了的，我只需设置一些非常简单的监控来帮助它们保持运行。

没有监控很糟糕

起初，我根本没有为我的服务器设置任何监控。这样做的结果是非常可预见的：有时网站坏了，而我却没有发现，直到有人告诉我！

步骤 1：uptime 检查器

第一步是建立一个 uptime 检查器。外面有很多这样的东西，我现在使用的是 updown.io 和 uptime robot。我更喜欢 updown 的用户界面和 定价 结构（它是按请求而不是按月收费），但 uptime 机器人有一个更慷慨的免费套餐。

它们会：


检查网站是否正常

如果出现故障，它会给我发电子邮件


我发现电子邮件通知对我来说是一个很好的通知级别，如果网站宕机，我会很快发现，但它不会吵醒我或做其它的什么打扰。

步骤 2：端到端的健康检查

接下来，让我们谈谈“检查网站是否正常”到底是什么意思。

起初，我只是把我的健康检查端点之一变成一…]]></summary>

testing.



	We obviously had that whole "Retbleed" thing, and it does show up
	in both the diffstat and the shortlog, and rc7 is definitely bigger
	than usual.  And also as usual, when we've had one of those
	embargoed hw issues pending, the patches didn't get the open
	development, and then as a result missed all the usual sanity
	checking by all the automation build and test infrastructure we
	have. So no surprise - there's been various small fixup patches
	afterwards too for some corner cases.

	That said, last week there were two other development trees that
	independently also asked for an extension, so 5.19 will be one of
	those releases that have an additional rc8 next weekend before the
	final release.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I recently worked on a project that required me to automate an ssh login with terminal prompt, sending various commands and checking the result of a test after it runs. Python is not installed on our server, which uses Paramiko to automate this sort of thing. But I was easily able to create a script using the Linux program called Autoexpect, which was written by Don Libes in 1990. I just call up the script that was automatically generated by Autoexpect (or you can write your own Expect script) and it runs the commands. There are options for accepting command-line inputs, adding wait times, and other tweaks that one might need to run through the prompts correctly. Just wanted to share. Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I hate web applications. They are super slow, clunky, do not have good shortcuts. Do not integrate well with the command line. 
 I have shifted to using many command line tools like pandoc, pdd, stopwatch, timer etc to avoid using many web applications. I don't use google docs, sheets or drive too and use the desktop programs like libre office, vim etc. 
 But there are still many web applications which are hard to replace like 
  
Youtube
 
Google maps
 
Reddit
 
Gmail
 
Netflix
 
Amazon music
 
Whatsapp web 
 Notion
 
 Do you guys find any good alternatives to these?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Findex is a highly customizable application finder written in Rust. It uses GTK and focuses on performance
 Findex v0.6.0 comes with vast improvements. This release isn't supposed to change the look of Findex that much. However, Findex was rewritten to have a better codebase in this release. Because of this, the performance of Findex has increased significantly. Check out the release page to see changelog.
 Release: https://github.com/mdgaziur/findex/releases/tag/v0.6.0
 Currently I'm very busy taking preparation for upcoming exam. So, I took shortcut and decided to use systemd to restart findex when configurations change. I'll properly implement it in next release.

开源代码几乎在地球上的每一台计算机上运行，当今世界重度依赖于 Linux 内核。这也意味着任何人都能够参与到代码的编写、阅读和使用过程中，这点让美国军方内部的网络安全专家感到十分担心。“关键的开源软件以我们仍然几乎不了解的方式，暴露于恶意的操纵之下。”美国国防部高级研究计划局（DARPA）设立了一个计划长达 18 个月、耗资数百万美元的 SocialCyber 项目。最终目标是检测并抵御任何恶意活动、提交有缺陷的代码、介入干预、阻止开发，甚至接管整个开源项目。为此研究人员将使用情绪分析等工具，来分析开源社区内的社交互动 —— 比如 Linux 内核邮件列表。这将有助于确定谁在积极参与建设，同时谁又在消极怠工或悄悄搞破坏。

老王点评：开源软件已经庞大到不能不依赖，而又非常警惕的规模了。




IE 团队收到来自 Mozilla 的谢幕祝贺蛋糕

微软的 IE 浏览器已于 6 月正式退役，这对科技行业的几乎所有人来说都是一个快乐的时刻。按照互相送蛋糕的悠久传统，Mozilla 的 Firefox 团队给微软 IE 团队送了最后一个蛋糕，以庆祝历史悠久的 IE 浏览器的落幕。蛋糕上面有一个巨大的 IE 标志。蛋糕上写着：“you were the ie6ing on the cake”。浏览器开发团队互相赠送蛋糕是一个可以追溯到十多年前的传统。微软在 2006 年Firefox 2.0 发布时给 Firefox 团队送了一个蛋糕，并在后来大多数的 Firefox 主要版本发布时都延续了这一传统。尽管随着浏览器发布周期的加快，这些蛋糕最终变成了杯子蛋糕。在 2012 年 IE 10 到来之后，Mozilla 向微软送了一个蛋糕，然后谷歌的 Chrome 团队也开始加入向对手送蛋糕的行列。

老王点评：还好，这次的蛋糕比较大，够团队分着吃了。




谷歌应用商店将由开发者来编写应用的权限描述

谷歌正在关闭独立的“应用权限”部分，新的数据安全部分显示了开发者提供的隐私注意事项清单，比如一个应用程序收集哪些数据，这些数据是如何存储的，以及这些数据与谁共享。开发者可以解释如何以及为什么要收集每一点数据。旧的应用程序权限列表可以保证是真实的，因为它是由谷歌通过扫描应用程序自动建立的。而数据安全系统则是在荣誉系统上运行的。谷歌称，“谷歌应用商店审查所有政策要求的应用；但是，我们不能代表开发者对他们如何处理用户数据做出判断。……当谷歌意识到你的应用行为与你的声明之间存在差异时，我们可能会采取适当的行动，包括执法行动。”

老王点评：话虽如此，我还是觉得应该保留独立的“应用权限”部分。]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[用过WordPress的用户都知道，在WordPress系统里，首页显示有两种方案，一种是显示最新文章，另一种是显示一个静态页面，设置地点在“外观”-“自定义”-“主页设置”里，这个功能对于制作企业或非博客类网站很有用。


　　而在Z-Blog中，并没有类似的设置，不过，我们可以通过一个变通的方法来实现同样的功能。


　　1、在后台-插件管理-静态管理中心里，确认页面URL配置方案为：{%host%}/{%alias%}.html


　　2、在后台-页面管理，点“新建页面”，建立一个新的页面，把这个页面作为首页，页面内容可以放首页需要的内容。页面标题为：首页，页面别名为:index，点击提交。


　　3、在后台-网站设置-评论设置里，选择关闭评论功能。


　　4、编辑web.config文件，在defaultDocument里，将index.html放在最前面。代码加载<rewrite>前面，具体添加的代码如下所示：



<defaultDocument>

<files>

<clear />

<add value="index.html" />

<add value="default.asp" />

</files>

</defaultDocument>



　　之后重建文件，这时候访问网站首页，就会发现网站首页内容为我们刚刚新建的页面内容了。


　　通过这个方法，可以完成Z-Blog自定义首页的功能，在制作企业网站或者其他各种各样的网站时，可以自由地选择在首页显示什么内容，在页面编辑里，也可以增加CSS，将首页充分进行自定义个性化设置。]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[On Alpine Linux, I noticed that windowing operations seem almost slow on X11. For example, in KeePassXC, sometimes I can trigger an action that shows a dialog, but then press Enter before the dialog even shows up. But on Windows, the same KeePassXC shows the dialog instantly - so there's no chance I can accidentally press a key too soon.
 This raised a question in my mind: is X11 slower than Windows? Is there some secret way to speed it up, or is the architecture just fundamentally slow?
 I run Xorg with Fluxbox as the window manager and Picom as the compositor. Would any of these be the reason for my observed slowness? Maybe the fact that I only have graphics acceleration on my iGPU, and not my Nvidia GPU?
 (Bonus: is Wayland faster than X11? I don't want to use it, because my entire reason for using X11 at the moment is because I want to make a compositor, not an entire desktop environment, but I'm curious anyway.)
 Note that this isn't a support request - I'd rather discuss if there's something up with X11's architecture that would make it fundamentally incapable of surpassing Windows' performance. Like how everything uses network connections to localhost...

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[在本杂志 2022 年 4 月号中，我们了解了不同类型的 SSL 证书及其应用。本文介绍如何手动更新现有 SSL 证书，以使其保持最新的安全要求。

当访问者与你的网站互动并分享信用卡号码等关键细节时，他们相信他们的信息已得到保护，不会被滥用。因此，你有责任尊重这种信任并为你网站上的所有访问者提供全面保护。不这样做不仅会使你失去客户的忠诚度，而且还可能使你陷入法律困境。在许多情况下，无法保护客户数据免遭泄露、盗窃或滥用的网站被迫支付巨额罚款，同时也失去了声誉。

SSL 证书如何保护客户的数据？

保护敏感客户信息的最佳方法之一是使用 SSL（安全套接字层）证书保护你的站点。用不涉及技术细节的话来说，SSL 证书对 Web 服务器和访问者浏览器之间的通信进行加密，从而使黑客或威胁参与者在技术上不可能窃取传输中的数据。 SSL 建立了一个安全的握手过程来解密加密的信息，这个过程太复杂了，人类甚至软件都无法破解。（LCTT 校注：此处言过其实，SSL 加密传输的信息并不是绝对不可截获和破解的，比如中间人攻击等。）

为什么需要更新 SSL 证书？

虽然 SSL 证书提供了防止数据盗窃或滥用的安全性，但你需要定期更新它以确保最有效的安全性以抵御最新的威胁。本文将列出以正确方式更新 SSL 证书的分步说明。

更新 SSL 证书有很多好处：


及时更新验证你的网站的身份。

获得更新的安全性。

一年有效期促进定期更新/升级保护范围的健康实践，从而消除与过时版本相关的风险。



注意：最佳做法是选择一种自动续订方式，以减轻你记住续订日期或手动执行相关步骤的压力。


有点跑题了，构建你自己的 SSL 证书的纯开源方式

是的，这绝对是真的！通过一些简化和紧凑的步骤，你实际上可以从头开始构建自己的 SSL 证书！虽然整个过程超出了本文的范围，但这…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[有一个想要为你带来一款诺基亚风格的 Linux 手机的开源项目，但诺基亚似乎并不喜欢这个项目的名字。




近期，一个旨在打造经典诺基亚（小型）的 Linux 手机的开源项目，遭到了诺基亚的抨击。

该项目的名称最初是 “Notkia”，然而，诺基亚认为该名称与自己相似，可能会影响自己的品牌声誉，并侵犯到自己的权利。

虽然这样做可以保护公司的业务，但这些公司向在当前状态下甚至对他们构不成威胁的项目发送侵权通知是怎么回事？

Notkia：开发一款袖珍 Linux 手机

不过还得 感谢 诺基亚的这个侵权通知，我们才能了解到这个有趣的项目：开发一款满足基本使用、注重隐私的小型 Linux 手机。

该项目的目标是设计一个完全适合诺基亚经典手机外壳的 PCB。



到目前为止，该项目已经支持许多硬件相关的功能，包括蓝牙和 Wi-Fi。

该项目不基于安卓，而是基于主线 Linux 内核。

你可以在他们的 官方博文 中，了解有关该项目和计划中的手机规格。

目前，该项目正在等待筹款，以便可以单独购买早期原型机。

灵感来自诺基亚，并受到诺基亚的关注

嗯，该项目清楚地表明他们受到诺基亚经典手机的启发，他们并没有试图误导任何贡献者和潜在客户。

该项目的创建者在推特上分享了诺基亚的电子邮件，同时他提到，诺基亚在将此类通知发送给以社区利益为主导的项目之前，应该更谨慎一些才对。


再次阅读 @Nokia 的邮件后，我开始感到愤怒。这无非是一场精心策划的演出。既然它是一个协作项目，并且得到了世界各地的人们的贡献，因此，我将把完整的电子邮件发布给它的“预期收件人”。




此外，他们确认该项目将更名。

当然，作为一个开源项目，它应该和诺基亚是扯不上关系的，除非他们使用诺基亚的品牌名称销售他们的原型/手机。

但是，在目前的状态下，这更像是一个激情项目，是开源爱好者社区协作努力的成果。因此，向他们发出侵犯诺基亚权利的通知，听起来实在有些牵强。

对吗？

当然，对于一般企业来说，这并不奇怪；但对于诺基亚来说，这未免有点过于谨慎和反竞争了。

更何况，我们可以肯定地说，诺基亚的最新的智能手机的表现，并没有达到用户的预期。

有趣的是，一位推特用户发现，还有一家名为 “Notkia” 的 IT 公司。他们是否也收到了诺基亚的通知？呵呵，谁知道呢。

那么，你如何看待这个基于 Linux 的袖珍手机的开源项目呢？在下面的评论中分享你的看法吧！

 Currently what I do is that:
 I put all of my notes, files and logs in a git repo on my desktop computer at home and push it to github and then I clone it on my work computer. Then if I make any changes there, I push it to github and then I pull the changes to my home computer.
 But this is creating so many unnecessary commits just to sync my files across the devices.
 Is there a more elegant way or a program? I hate google drive, the interface is really ugly an d slow and I can't sync them all easily and I can't use it from command line.

黄心村（章静绘）
香港大学比较文学系的黄心村教授就读于加利福尼亚大学洛杉矶分校时，博士论文即以张爱玲为题。此后，她在威斯康辛大学执教多年，研究领域扩展到二十世纪华语文学、东亚跨文化研究和视听文化研究。五年前，黄教授来到香港大学，借着筹办张爱玲百年诞辰在线展览的机会，重拾张爱玲研究。她有意识地运用上述诸领域的研究方法，利用新鲜出土的材料，辅以“焦距的调整”，最终在新著《缘起香港：张爱玲的异乡和世界》中展现了一个崭新、迷人的世界，大大深化了我们对张爱玲的认识。在接受《上海书评》的采访时，她谈到了我们要在何种参照系下怎样重新阅读张爱玲：不能简单地将她与同时代的作家相比，而是要“从张爱玲重新出发”，去挖掘她背后更加丰富、深邃的文本空间与创作源头——不仅仅包括她的文字写作，还有她的图像创作、她对设计的理解……
《缘起香港：张爱玲的异乡和世界》，黄心村著，香港中文大学出版社，2022年7月
您的新著《缘起香港》以张爱玲在香港大学的求学经历为起点，还原她在港大的住所、课堂，而且您重走了张爱玲曾经上学的道路，爬了她曾经爬过的山坡，也考证了她的写作与她的历史老师佛朗士、中文老师许地山之间的渊源。您指出，今天的港大中文学院大致沿袭了当年许地山拟定的格局。能否请您谈谈港大中文学院的现状？今天港大中文学院的师生对张爱玲的香港经历是否还有一些共同的记忆和体验？
重走张爱玲上学路：沿宝珊道往山下走，当年的山路没有沥青铺面，应该比较窄，但路边的护坡石墙和根须盘绕的细叶大榕树应该在张爱玲的时代就有了。黄心村摄于2022年2月。
黄心村：港大中文学院目前的结构确实跟当年许地山改组以后的结构相差不大，可见许地山当年的理念是超前的，他用一种现代的学科整合的方式、角度来重新设置了中文系的课程。张爱玲当年上学的时候，主科是英文和历史，辅科修的是中文，包括…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Flatpaks can be useful in many circumstances. Like for instance automatic updates for discord, and also discord not stealing your data. But when you start using flatpaks for other apps such as steam, it breaks things, modding doesn’t work, etc. flatpaks are great but should be only used in certain cases. Imo system packages are much superior.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello,
This is a portfolio optimizer I made to help select portfolios for my clients. I'm a personal financial adviser. I generally put my clients in a mix of low-fee index funds and ETFs and I use this to set an appropriate allocation based on the client's risk tolerance.
I have been working on this as a side project to 1) improve the theoretical underpinnings of my investment recommendations and 2) improve my coding skills with frameworks like Vue and Torch. Here's the repository for the frontend: https://github.com/justinluther502/cashgraphfront.
The frontend site is Vue 2 + Vuetify, and the backend is an AWS lambda function running the Torch optimizer. I am still working out kinks in the backend, particularly cold-start issues because the Lambda function has to load the entire Torch library (~2GB). This occasionally causes the AWS API Gateway to reach max timeout before the Lambda function finishes. Any tips on addressing this would be much appreciated. My first thought is maybe to pare down the Torch library used in the Lambda function because I am only using a small subset of the full library.
The optimizer function itself is designed to overcome several classic shortcomings in Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT) (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modern_portfolio_theory). Unlike textbook implementations of MPT, this optimizer can utilize non-normal returns distributions, risk metrics besides variance, and can allow the user to specify tail behavior, such as asset correlations behaving normally most of the time but converging to 1.0 in severe downturns. Most of these "fixes" happen during the generation of custom "flavors", or asset selection universes. I have 3 flavors pre-built and there is some information on how they are constructed in the flavor selection page.
Any feedback greatly appreciated!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[7月15日，有网友发文质疑迪奥发布的一款半身裙疑似抄袭中国的马面裙，“迪奥抄袭”相关话题冲上热搜第一。有汉服爱好者发现，迪奥新上市的一件标价2.9万元的裙子，与中国传统服饰“马面裙”的设计非常相似，迪奥官网介绍里称“这条半裙采用标志性的Dior廓形，是一款全新的优雅时尚的单品”。这样的表述引发诸多网友不满，纷纷指责该品牌“抄袭”“文化挪用”“文化剽窃”。


　　目前，迪奥并未对此事作出回应，但迪奥中国官网目前已无法搜索到这条裙子。迪奥海外地区官网上，这款半身裙仍在售。


　　我认为，根据中国的法律，迪奥根本没有任何侵权问题。知识产权是具有地域性和时间性的，经一国法律所保护的某项权利只在该国范围内发生法律效力，并且有相应的保护期限。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[谷歌从安卓中移除大量 Fuchsia 代码

本周，谷歌从安卓开源项目（AOSP）中移除了大量关于 Fuchsia 设备的代码。在谷歌的设想中，Fuchsia 设备可以运行来自安卓和 Linux 等其他系统的应用程序。想要达成这个目标有多种途径，谷歌最早尝试的是在一个虚拟机上运行完整的安卓系统实例，但这存在一些潜在的性能问题。另一种方式就是增强 Fuchsia 和安卓运行时环境的直接关系，在 2019 年时谷歌在 AOSP 里创建了一个项目，能够为 Fuchsia 设备创建安卓运行时。这次这些代码的移除，正式标志着这种方式的终结。在留下的 TODO 信息里，表明谷歌正在创建一个新的 “Starnix” 项目，让 Fuchsia 能够“原生”运行为 Linux/安卓开发的应用和库，即一个从 Linux 的底层内核架构到 Fuchsia 的 Zircon 内核的翻译层。


消息来源：9to5google



老王点评：其实，谷歌在操作系统方面的野心很大，只是一直被掩盖在 Windows 和 Mac 下面没那么引人注意。




openSUSE 率先对 Nim 语言提供支持

Nim 语言 是一种新兴的语言，创建于 2005 年。这种经过编译的静态类型的编程语言有一个外部函数接口，可以与 C/C++、JavaScript 和其他语言交互。Nim 自称“结合了 Python、Ada 和 Modula 等成熟语言的成功概念”，以前曾被称为像 C 一样快，又像 Python 一样具有表现力、像 Lisp 编程语言一样可扩展。openSUSE 不仅宣布为 Nim 语言提供最新的软件包，而且对这个静态类型、命令式编程语言的提供一级支持。Nim 的作者及社区对 openSUSE 提供一级支持表示欢欣鼓舞。


消息来源：Phoronix



老王点评：很多新兴语言都雄心勃勃，但是一种编程语言要成功，真有时候有很多侥幸的地方。




Rocky Linux 9.0 发布

Rocky Linux 9.0 建立在 RHEL 9.0 的基础上，并计划支持近十年，直到 2032 年 5 月。现有的Rocky Linux 8 将继续被支持到 2029 年 5 月。Rocky Linux 渴望成为 CentOS Stream 之前的 CentOS。由于使用了红帽企业 Linux 9.0 的源代码，它的所有功能与 5 月份达到 GA 的那个 RHEL 发行版相同。


消息来源：Phoronix



老王点评：从目前看起来，Rocky Linux 和 Alma Linux 是最肖似 CentOS 的继承者了。]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[试试这个轻量级的开源工具，不用离开终端就可以预览文件。




查看你的文件和文件夹的最基本方法是使用命令 ls 和 ll。但是有时候，我不仅想看到文件的元数据，还想一目了然地看到文件的内容。为此，我使用 ranger。

如果你喜欢在控制台中工作，并使用 Vim 或 Vi，而且你不想因为任何原因离开你的终端，那么 ranger 就是你最好的新朋友。ranger 是一个精简的文件管理器，它不仅可以让你浏览文件，还可以预览它们。ranger 与 rifle 捆绑在一起，rifle 是一个文件执行器，可以有效地选择与特定文件类型相关的程序。

在 Linux 上安装 ranger

ranger 可以在 Fedora 或任何基于 RPM 的发行版中安装，方法是运行：

$ sudo dnf install ranger


ranger 也可以用于 其他发行版和 macOS。

第一次使用 ranger

作为一个用户，你可以在你喜欢的终端上简单地输入 ranger 来启动 ranger。可以用方向键浏览。这张截图是一个很好的例子，我可以预览存储在 Kernel-tests 中的 config.example 文件的代码。



选中任何文件并按下 F4 键，就可以打开你的默认编辑器，让你立即编辑这些文件！

图像和视频怎么办？

使用 rifle 和 ranger 可以让你快速找到与某一文件相关的程序。将鼠标悬停在图片上，然后试图打开它是非常简单的，只要点击回车即可。下面是它的样子：



在一个图像文件上点击 i 会给用户提供所有的 EXIF 数据。点击 Shift+Enter 将打开这个 PDF 文件。



同样的组合键将在系统默认的支持该编解码器的视频播放器中打开并开始播放视频。下面的例子是一个 mp4 视频，它在 VLC 上播放得很好。



文件操作

除非 Vim 用户另有配置，否则下面的键绑定工作良好。


j：下移

k：上移

h: 移动到父目录

gg：移到列表的顶部

i：预览文件

r：打开文件

zh：查看隐藏文件

cw：重命名当前文件

yy：复制文件

dd：剪切文件

pp：粘贴文件

u：撤销

z：改变设置

dD：删除文件


控制台命令

有时我在起草文章时，有一个文件夹包含某个软件的截图。通过点击空格选择或标记文件，然后输入 :bulkrename，可以帮助我把所有奇怪的时间戳变成如：lorax1、lorax2 等等。下面是一个例子。



其他有用的控制台命令包括：


penwith：用你选择的程序打开一个选择的文件

:touch FILENAME：创建一个文件

:mkdir FILENAME：创建一个目录

:shell <command>：在 shell 中运行一个命令

:delete：删除文件


在 tty2/3/4 中能工作吗？

作为一个从事质量保证（QA）工作的人，我发现搜索日志和阅读日志从未如此简单。即使我的 Gnome 显示管理器崩溃了，我也可以切换到我的 tty2，用我的用户名和密码登录，并以超级用户权限启动 ranger，然后我就可以尽情地探索了！

ranger 是一个很好的工具，可以在不离开终端的情况下处理文件。ranger 是精简的，也是可定制的，所以不妨一试吧！

 来源：澎湃新闻
                
祝总斌先生走了。悲痛之中，想起许多和他有关的往事。

祝先生的学术专长主要是秦汉魏晋南北朝史、中国古代政治制度史、中国古代法治史。他开设的相关课程，在学生中很受欢迎。但我上本科时想学中国思想史，对这些学科都不大感兴趣，所以没听过祝先生的课。事后想起来，颇感遗憾。我第一次和祝先生接触，是本科四年级写毕业论文时。系里让同学们自报论文题目，由各位老师根据自己的专长和兴趣来认领，无人认领的则由教研室主任负责。我报的题目是“商周时期孝观念的起源、发展及其社会原因”。不出意料，果然无人认领。祝先生是中国古代史教研室主任，于是便成了我的学士论文指导教师。第一次去家里找他谈论文，见他穿一件旧棉袄，腰里系着一根绳。家里没有书房，他在卧室中工作。卧室一面墙都是书架，摆满了书。没有写字台和座椅，他就坐在床边，在一张中学生用的小课桌上读书写作。我当时产生一个念头，长时间这么坐着，没有靠背，腰受得了吗？我的论文是三年级写的习作，经过反复修改，已经比较成熟。祝先生看后，没提太多修改意见，只是要求我对一条转引的材料去查找核对原始出处。史料一定不能转引，这是祝先生教我的第一条做学问的规矩。
祝总斌先生在家中
1983年考研，我选了魏晋南北朝史方向，祝先生是我的研究生导师。本科四年，说实话，我没学到太多东西，对历史学懵懵懂懂，还没入门。硕士三年，跟着祝先生学习，才逐渐摸到了治学的门道。祝先生指导我们十分用心。除了选修他在系里开设的课程外，我们还要上一门《通鉴》读书课，每周读三卷，两周讨论一次。这时祝先生已经住进中关园宿舍，有了书房，读书课就在书房里上。每次上课前，他都会预先做准备，翻看要讨论的内容，还会把椅子摆好，并在我们的座位前各放一杯茶和一块糖，很温馨。第一次系统阅读史料书，问题当然会很多。祝先生总是不厌其烦地解答我们的问题，…]]></summary>

《本雅明传》，[美]霍华德·艾兰、迈克尔·詹宁斯著，王璞译，上海文艺出版社，2022年7月出版，908页，145.00元
“欧洲现代性的见证”和“多重”自我

在评传第一页上，两位作者称本雅明为“欧洲现代性”的“重要见证”，以此为“细节”纺织的机杼，提供出“批评之生命”的基本历史索引。这是怎样的欧罗巴啊——两次世界大战酝酿于此，并最终降下“铁”雨（借用布莱希特的著名比喻）。本雅明小时候亲历了柏林崛起为现代都会，沐浴在德意志第二帝国的余晖之中。他父亲不断置业，他们全家最终搬进新区的豪宅，这也可以当作德国资本主义大发展的一页史料。出身于犹太富人之家，不满于传统教育模式，学生本雅明在“一战”前参与“青年运动”，试图以新一代人的精神强度来改造死气沉沉的德国社会。而和许多同代中欧知识人一样，他在“一战”中经历了友人的自戕，一生都无法从中走出。本雅明的成年生活主要是在两次世界大战之间度过的，他被欧洲学院体制拒之门外，却又活跃于“魏玛文化”之中。他是异类知识分子，也是欧洲先锋派运动的一员。他在绝大多数照片上都穿着正装，但又大胆尝试新媒介和新的生活样式，还是电台广播作者。他不仅热爱浪游，而且访问过莫斯科，那里有试图克服资本主义的“组织生活”。然而法西斯主义化为笼罩全欧的黑云，他曾在意大利的岛屿上见识过墨索里尼的巡游，纳粹控制德国之后，他以巴黎为中心，度过了流亡岁月。他的死因是——他没有逃离欧罗巴的“通道”（法文中“通道”和“拱廊街”为同一词）。本雅明在书信中说，在逼近“二战”的日子里，欧洲的“大气层”饱含泪水，“希望”就像稀有的“信号弹”，偶尔才升起。本雅明“见证”的，是欧洲现代性的所有灯光在幻景般闪烁后又一盏盏熄灭，是整个布尔乔亚文明在二十世纪的多重转变、全面危机和总体内爆。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Arch Linux 在桌面 Linux 世界中非常流行。受欢迎的原因之一是 安装 Arch Linux 本身就是一项复杂的任务。

我没有夸大其词。安装 Ubuntu 或 Debian 比 Arch Linux 容易得多，因为官方没给后者提供图形界面的安装程序。

这时虚拟机就派上用场了。

你可以先在 VirtualBox 中尝试安装 Arch Linux，看看它是否是你想在实际硬件上运行的系统。通过这种方式，你可以在不弄乱当前操作系统的情况下体验 Arch Linux。

在本文，我将一步一步指导你完成一个实用的 Arch Linux 虚拟机的安装过程。

在 VirtualBox 上安装 Arch Linux

毫无疑问，你需要先 在 Linux 上安装 VirtualBox（或在 Windows 上）。在 Windows 上，只需访问 Oracle 的网站并下载 VirtualBox。


下载 VirtualBox


如果你使用的是 Windows 10 或更高版本，请确保你的系统已启用虚拟化。

完成后，你需要到 Arch Linux 官方网站 下载 ISO 文件。你应该找到 使用 torrent 下载 或直接下载文件的选项。



你可以保留 ISO 文件以备不时之需，安装成功后也可以将其删除以 释放系统上的空间。

现在，让我们开始在 VirtualBox 上安装 Arch Linux 吧。

第一部分 创建虚拟机

第一步：首先，你需要在 VirtualBox 中设置一下。启动 VirtualBox 并单击 “新建New” 来创建一个虚拟机。



注意，你可以使用 “向导模式guided mode” 继续创建虚拟机，但使用 “专家模式expert mode” 可以一目了然地获得更多选项。



因此，我推荐使用…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[我喜欢 在 Ubuntu 中使用深色模式。在我看来深色模式能够缓解视觉疲劳，让系统看起来更加的赏心悦目。

我发现了一个 gedit 文本编辑器的小麻烦，如果你在深色模式下使用它，你也许也会遇到。

默认情况下 gedit 高亮当前光标所在的行。这是一个非常有用的功能，但是如果你在 Linux 系统中开启了深色模式，那么你将会感到痛苦。为什么？因为被高亮的文本将不再变得可读。你自己看吧：



如果你选择文本，它将变得可读，但这并不是一个让人感到有多么愉快的阅读或者编辑体验。（LCTT 校注：在新的 Ubuntu 22.04 中，这一情况已经有所改善，“高亮当前行”已被取消勾选）



好消息是你不需要再忍受它。我将演示几个步骤让你能够同时享受 gedit 以及系统的深色模式。

让 gedit 在深色模式下阅读体验友好

你基本上有两个选择：


禁用高亮当前行，但也同时意味着你必须清楚地知道你在哪一行。

改变默认的颜色设置，但编辑器的颜色会变得稍微有些不同，而且如果你更改系统主题，它不会自动切换到浅色模式。


在 gedit 或者 GNOME 的开发者解决这个问题之前，这是你必须要做的应变和妥协。

选项1： 禁止高亮当前行

当你打开 gedit 后，点击汉堡菜单然后选择“首选项Preferences”。



在查看选项卡，你应该看到在 “高亮Highlighting” 区域的下方的 “高亮当前行Highlight current line” 选项。取消勾选这个选项，马上就可以看到效果。



“高亮当前行”是一个有用的功能，如果你想继续使用它，请选择第二个选项。

选项2： 更改编辑器的颜色主题

在“首选项Preferences”窗口，找到 “字体与颜色Font & Colors” 标签页，然后将颜色主题更改为 “Oblivion”、“Solarized Dark”，或者 “Cobalt”。



正如我前面所提到的，缺点就是当你把系统主题切换为浅色模式时，编辑器将不会自动切换到浅色模式。

开发者应该修复的一个 bug

这里 有几个 Linux 可用的文本编辑器 ，但是为了快速阅读或编辑文本文件，我更推荐使用 gedit。尽管如此，小烦恼仍旧是小烦恼。开发者应该在将来的版本中为这个很好的文本编辑器修复这个问题，让我们不再求助于这些应对办法。

你呢？你在你的系统上使用深色模式还是浅色模式？你注意到 gedit 的这个问题了吗？你有使用什么方法去解决它吗？欢迎分享你的经验。

 We have software developed in Acu Cobol currently running v10 that are distributed to clients on a CentOS7 installation, reason for using CentOS was always to save the client costs on commercial O/S licensing.

 Moving away from CentOS does pose a bit of challenge as requirements for me would be things like: 1. Still keeping inline with cost saving, it can’t be commercial licensed. 2.

　　郭明錤指出，目前在中国市场上，苹果iPhone 14的预付定金明显高于iPhone 13系列，甚至在某些地区足足高出一倍。


　　郭明錤表示，这可能是因为在华为退出5G智能手机市场后，苹果目前几乎霸占了整个中国高端智能手机市场。这也意味着中国市场潜在的高端iPhone用户数量有所增加。


　　预付定金是在上市前确保即将到来的智能手机供应的费用，比iPhone 13"明显高"，在一些地区，它比之前的产品阵容高一倍之多。


　　"组件供应商和EMS的iPhone 14出货量预测在22年下半年分别约为1亿和9000万台，"郭明錤写道。"中国市场对iPhone 14的稳固需求可能会减少市场对iPhone 14上市后削减订单风险的担忧。"供应链消息人士还重申，之前传出的iPhone 14首批订单被砍的传闻，完全就是谣言，非但没有砍，苹果还在加单iPhone 13系列，真的是产销两旺的局面。

several days, according to Greg
Kroah-Hartman, due to problems that have come up with the Retbleed
mitigation patches.


	 The problems are purely due to the fact that we were forced to do
	 this type of work "in private" with very limited ability for
	 testing by the normal larger kernel community like we rely on.  We
	 don't have fancy or huge private testing labs where we can do all
	 of this work as we are an open source project, and we rely on open
	 testing in public.


The ongoing problems might yet slow down the 5.19 release as well.

Update: there has actually been a different set of updates
released:
5.18.12,
5.15.55,
5.10.131, and
5.4.206.  These revert a single problematic

 I'm pretty accostumed to terminal and cli apps, but I love KDE and switch back and forth between Sway and KDE (before wayland it was bspwm), but I don't stay at KDE too long.
 I feel more "productive" because I use the keyboard all the time and most shortcuts from the apps I use are similar to Vim (hjkl, ctrl+d, ctrl+u, etc).
 And my PC is a laptop, so touchpad is terrible, but now my laptop will be stationary since I don't need to travel for work anymore so I have full access to an external mouse and keyboard all the time.
 I'll write some workflow example:
 I use CMUS for music and nnn for file management.
  
I just downloaded a new album. It is in my downloads folder.
 
Right now on my screen I have the terminal with cmus.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[谷歌正式推出可装在普通电脑的 ChromeOS Flex 操作系统

ChromeOS Flex 是一个基于 ChromeOS、兼容大部分硬件的操作系统，谷歌官方表示经过验证的设备已经“超过 400 款”。ChromeOS Flex 可以下载到 USB 设备中，然后在 Mac 或者 Windows 设备上进行安装。它于今年 2 月推出，主要基于谷歌在 2020 年收购的 CloudReady 的技术。它最大的优势就是能够让老旧设备“焕发生机”，尤其是那些原生系统已经无法再获得软件更新的设备。在未经谷歌认证的设备上同样可以安装 ChromeOS Flex，只要这些设备符合官方的最低要求。


消息来源：谷歌



老王点评：不知道是不是和 ChromeOS 一样，需要那种不一样的网络？




尼康停止单反相机的开发

配备高清摄像头的智能手机正在侵蚀相机市场，尼康表示今后将专注于开发逐渐在市场上成为主流的、引进人工智能和图像处理技术的无反相机。尼康在 1959 年推出首款单反相机 Nikon F，自 2020 年 6 月推出面向专业人士的旗舰机型 D6 后，再未推出过单反相机的新产品。单反相机的优势是可以根据被拍摄物体和摄影环境更换镜头。尼康在单反相机的销量份额上仅次于佳能，排在世界第 2 位。佳能也计划在数年内结束单反相机的旗舰机型的开发。


消息来源：日经中文网



老王点评：单反相机估计没想到它的敌人是智能手机吧。




谷歌高管认为 Instagram 和 TikTok 在侵蚀该公司核心产品

TikTok 对谷歌业务的威胁不限于视频服务 YouTube，谷歌公司高管承认 Instagram 和 TikTok 危及到了公司核心产品：搜索和地图。新一代的用户的搜索习惯和以前的用户不同，他们不是输入查询词，而是倾向于通过更沉浸的方式发现内容。比如在搜寻餐馆时，四成的年轻人不是打开谷歌地图或搜索，而是打开 TikTok 或 Instagram。


消息来源：Tech Crunch



老王点评：和单反的情况类似，打败搜索的不是更好的搜索，反而是其它的产品。]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[为何小小的单板机是智能工作以及小型办公室的未来。




随着疫情的大流行，我们的工作方式也正在发生着改变。工作的分散化正在成为所有公司需要面临的一项重要挑战。

智能办公室

即使工厂认为智能办公仅仅是通过虚拟私有网络来对员工的笔记本电脑进行远程控制，再稍微增加一点进化也可以让一些基本的办公服务离人们更近一点，这些都能够极大降低数据中心的负载，并且提高人们的工作体验。这个方案还有一个额外的影响就是从信息和通信技术（ICT）上来说消除了许多单点故障。

与其在公司外部有成百上千的工作场地，不如在世界范围内有着成百上千的小型办公室/分支，这就是所谓的“智能办公室”。

这种表述可能会让许多 ICT 专家感到恐慌，因为这种文化使得每个办公室都与一台大机器（即服务器）联系在一起，即使分散计算资源的优势非常明显。

一个不同的角度

如果你能用一块 50 美元的小开发板提供一个大服务器的服务会怎么样？如果这个小板子只需要一张 SD 卡和一个普通的 USB 电源支持，那又会怎么样呢？这就是 树莓派 是最灵活的解决方案的原因所在。

树莓派开发板是尺寸非常小的运行 Linux 的计算机。它有一个由树莓派基金会提供和维护的操作系统：树莓派操作系统Raspberry Pi OS。它基于 Debian，并与这个最知名的 Linux 发行版共享许多软件包。此外，许多树莓派的开发板能够完美运行最知名的 Ubuntu 服务器，它涵盖了 ARM 处理器支持，提供了对低功耗处理器的支持。

但树莓派开发板对小公司来说也是一个很好的机会，以能够承担得起的代价获得大量的（开源）服务。但这种情况下，你必须考虑数据丢失的风险，因为你把所有的服务运行在一个小的、消费级的硬件上。不过设置正确的备份/恢复程序能够降低这些风险。

你能从树莓派开发板上提供什么服务？

大多数服务通常由更昂贵的服务器提供。这里的“大多数”取决于一些限制：


ARM 处理器： 一些软件包只支持 x86/x64 处理器。这是最难克服的挑战之一。但另一方面，ARM 处理器的市场份额不断增长，使得程序员为他们的软件开发了兼容 ARM 处理器的版本。

内存容量： 这是一个仅限于在复杂应用以复杂的方式进行复杂的计算的情况下讨论的问题。很多时候，这只不过是关于重新审查代码、拆分步骤，并保持简单高效的问题。此外，如果一个服务虽然只服务少数几个用户，但需要大量的内存/CPU，这大概也意味着此服务没有正常工作。这可能是你消除浪费资源的旧问题的一个机会。最后，最新的树莓派开发板把内存容量升级到了 8GB，这是一个很大的提升。

对服务器没有经验的用户： 这是另一个问题，你可以在基础镜像所在的树莓派的 micro-SD 卡中存储系统和运行数据。


也就是说，你能够用树莓派做很多有趣的事情。在 我的博客 里，我通过运行各种服务进行了测试 —— 从基本的 LAMP 服务器到复杂的 CRM。从简单到复杂系统，全部都是开源的，例如：


代理服务器（也能够添加广告拦截服务）

电子邮件服务器

打印服务器

酒店管理

联系关系管理（CRM）

私人社交网络

私人论坛

私有 Git 门户网站

网络监控服务器

许多其他有用的服务


对树莓派来说，另一个有趣的用法是在你的远程办公室获得提供高级服务的 Wi-Fi 热点，并且可以从它的以太网端口进行控制。

最后，树莓派也能够运行容器，这是一个额外的工具，从这个不可思议的开发板中获得一个可用的服务世界。

《本雅明传》，[美]霍华德·艾兰、迈克尔·詹宁斯著，王璞译，上海文艺出版社，2022年7月出版，908页，145.00元
“矛盾而流动的整体”

“……我多元的信念所代表的那个矛盾而流动的整体”——二十世纪犹太裔德国批评家、理论家和文人瓦尔特·本雅明（1892-1940）曾如此形容自己的思想生活。他的多样作品、不幸经历以及迟来的声名，不论在英语世界还是中文世界，都仍然散发出近乎奥义般的吸引力。2014年夏天，最初接到翻译Walter Benjamin: A Critical Life的邀请时，我一口答应，几乎不假思索。这部传记，“英语中第一部完整的”本雅明传，出自霍华德·艾兰（Howard Eiland）和迈克尔·W. 詹宁斯（Michael W. Jennings）的“四手联弹”。我上大学在图书馆乱翻瓦尔特·本雅明著作英译本时，已经注意到这两位本雅明专家的名字。艾兰曾长期担任麻省理工学院的文学讲师；詹宁斯则是普林斯顿大学的德语系教授。从二十世纪九十年代起，在编辑林赛水（Lindsay Waters）的强力推动下，哈佛大学出版社成为本雅明著作英语译介的重镇，这两位学者的努力和配合贯穿于哈佛社版四卷本《瓦尔特·本雅明文选》（Walter Benjamin: Selected Writings）的编译工作。从1996年至2003年，这套选集终于出齐，时至今日仍是英语世界对本雅明作品的一份相对完备的呈现。同时，艾兰也是本雅明遗稿《拱廊街计划》（The Arcades Project）和专题选集《现代生活的作家——论波德莱尔》（The Writer of Modern Life: Essays on Charles Baudelaire）的英译者之一。而詹宁斯不仅编辑了《现代生活的作家》，还是《可技术复…]]></summary>

        <updated>2022-07-14T19:16:15.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi HN.
I built Payload to make file transfers easy for less-technical users who need large/fast transfers, so I have focused on auto-discovery, drag-and-drop, visually distinct device icons.
It's using Tauri (an "Electron alternative" built on Rust) which keeps my binaries small and bundles to .msi, .dmg, .deb and .appimage. No CLI, iOS or Android support (yet).
The network stack is a separate binary written in Go. It uses mDNS for local network discovery and TLS over TCP or Quic, with a public Ed25519 keypair for each device. The protocol is ad-hoc and symmetrical control stream using JSON and binary data streams. Planning to open source these parts eventually..
Transfers should saturate the local network link. It reaches ~116 MB/s wired at my home, but if you have a >1000 Mbit link, I'd be curious to see how much speed you can squeeze out.

 Recently a Chinese novelists claimed that his draft with about 1 million words got "locked" due to the file being "against the regulations". Notice that the user claimed that it's not just the file on the cloud that got banned, but the local file also got locked. Despite WPS's repeated denials, many other users also reported similar incidents.
 I decided to post it here because many users in Linux community use WPS as an alternative to MS office. While this problem may or may not apply to non-Chinese or linux users, who most likely use a different version from what most Chinese users use on Windows, this is a reminder that you should avoid any Chinese software if possible unless it's a battle-tested open source software.

programmers to write programs that can run safely in kernel space. All
memory accesses and function calls in BPF programs are statically checked
for safety using the in-kernel verifier, which
analyzes programs in their entirety before allowing them to be loaded.
While this allows the kernel to safely run BPF programs, it heavily
restricts what those programs are able to do. Among these
constraints is a rule that programs cannot store pointers into BPF maps for
use (such as dereferencing them or passing them to the kernel in
kfunc and BPF helper invocations) at a

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[微软联合创始人比尔·盖茨宣布将自己的全部财产捐给与他前妻梅琳达·弗伦奇·盖茨共同领导的慈善基金会，从而退出全球富豪榜。而且，作为一项直接措施，这位微软创始人13日宣布再向基金会注资200亿美元。


　　作为全球规模最大的基金会之一，比尔及梅琳达·盖茨基金会则宣布，得益于新获资金，计划到2026年将其在全球健康、减贫及平等方面的年度支出增加50%。基金会的目标是，应对正在撼动地球的“不断加剧的多重全球危机”。


　　根据彭博的亿万富翁指数，比尔·盖茨的净资产约1140 亿美元，目前在全球富豪榜排名第四。盖茨也声称其通过捐款逐步减少自己的财富，并最终脱离世界首富的名号。沃伦·巴菲特上个月也向盖茨基金会捐资31亿美元。这两笔捐资将使盖茨基金会的总资金达到约700亿美元。盖茨的捐款将使基金会能在2026年前将每年的项目支出提高50%，达到90亿美元。盖茨还提到新冠、俄乌冲突、气候变化与通货膨胀加在一起，促使基金会有必要在关注的核心领域投入更多资源，这些领域包括卫生、教育、性别均等和减贫。


　　报道称，比尔·盖茨在他的博客上解释道：“展望未来，我计划将自己的全部财富捐给基金会，除了我花在自己和家人身上的钱之外。”


　　他说：“在基金会之外，我还对包括阿尔茨海默症在内的美国医疗保健问题捐赠和投资了一些资金。通过‘突破能源联盟’，我将继续为应对气候变化投资和捐献资金。总的来说，我希望这些领域的工作能够盈利，而这些钱也会流向基金会。我将从全球富豪榜上跌落，最终消失。捐钱对我而言不是牺牲。我很荣幸能够参与应对这些巨大挑战。我享受这项工作，并且相信我有义务以最能改善生活的方式将我的资源回馈社会。”


　　据彭博社报道，这笔捐款相当于比尔·盖茨财产的五分之一。据《福布斯》杂志报道，这对前夫妻迄今为止共捐赠了约550亿美元，而这笔捐款使比尔·盖茨在全球富豪榜上滑落一位，位列第五。


　　报道称，2010年，比尔·盖茨和梅琳达·盖茨与大亨沃伦·巴菲特发起“捐助承诺”运动，当时有40个亿万富翁或家庭加入，现已有400多位签署者。参与者要承诺将大部分财产捐赠给慈善事业，“以解决社会上一些最紧迫的问题”。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[谷歌披露其内部使用的 Linux 滚动发行版

谷歌早期使用的内部 Linux 发行版是基于 Ubuntu LTS 的 Goobuntu。Ubuntu LTS 需要每隔两年更新一次，这对于需要升级几十万台计算机的谷歌来说并非易事。因此谷歌转向了滚动更新发行版，它没有使用著名的滚动更新发行版，如 Arch Linux，而是基于 Debian 测试分支构建了自己的滚动发行版。它将新发行版称为 gLinux Rodete（是 Rolling Debian Testing 的缩写）。Debian 测试分支是滚动更新的。谷歌引入了名为 Sieve 的工作流系统，使用虚拟化测试套装确保软件包新版本不会破坏核心组件和开发者的工作流程。谷歌于 2018 年底完成迁移，次年关闭了剩余的 Goobuntu。

老王点评：谷歌的这个经验其实可以供其它的大型 IT 企业参考。




谷歌云宣布采用 ARM 芯片

谷歌云周三宣布，他们将开始采用基于 ARM 技术的芯片。随着谷歌加入 ARM 阵营，几乎所有大型云服务提供商现在都已经开始提供基于 ARM 的云计算服务。谷歌云的新服务将基于 Ampere 公司的 Altra 芯片，该公司还向微软和甲骨文等企业出售芯片。另外一些云计算提供商，如甲骨文、阿里云则在设计自己的 ARM 架构芯片，并且已经委托工厂进行生产。


消息来源：Tech Crunch



老王点评：ARM 和 RISC-V 大行其道，我想英特尔和 AMD 感受到压力了吧。




去年几乎整个工业行业都受到过攻击

《2022 年工业安全状况报告》调查了 800 名负责这些工业系统的高级 IT 和安全负责人。报告发现，94% 的受访者在过去 12 个月里，其工业物联网（IIoT）或运营技术（OT）系统经历了某种形式的攻击。关键基础设施是网络犯罪分子的一个有吸引力的目标，但不幸的是，IIoT/OT 安全项目往往被其他安全举措所取代，或者由于成本或复杂性而失败，使组织处于风险之中。


消息来源：CSO Online



老王点评：其实工业互联网真没体验过互联网那么疯狂的攻击力度。至少互联网企业大多都有网络安全相关人员，工业互联网很少有专门配置的网络安全人员。]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[massCode 是一个开源的代码片段管理器，使你能够涉足代码，提高生产力，并节省时间。




如果一个工具能让事情变得更快、更有效率，那对许多开发者来说就是救命稻草。

虽然有各种服务和平台试图使编码体验更快，但你仍然有其他几个选择可以考虑。

例如，代码片段管理器。使用代码片段管理器，你的目的是保存你想快速访问的代码片段。它更像是指定快捷方式，在你的程序中添加所需的代码。

这不是一个新的概念，但可用于这项工作的工具可能不完全是开源的。

幸运的是，我偶然发现了一个不错的项目，它为你提供了一个自由开源的片段管理器，即 massCode。

massCode：跨平台的开源片段管理器



massCode 是一个有用的代码片段管理器，具有一些基本功能。

它支持广泛的编程语言，还包括对 Markdown 的支持。你可以使用文件夹组织你的代码片段，添加标签等。

massCode 可用于 Linux、Windows 或 macOS。让我们来看看一些主要功能。

massCode 的特点



massCode 包括许多有用的功能。其中一些是：


多层次的文件夹结构

每个片段都可以存储在片段（标签）中

集成的编码编辑器 Ace

代码格式化或高亮显示

支持带预览的 Markdown

能够搜索片段

给你的代码段添加描述，以了解它的用途

各种深色/浅色主题可用

能够从 SnippetsLab 迁移

自动保存以帮助你保留你的工作

将其与云同步文件夹整合

支持 VSCode、Raycast 和 Alfred 的扩展


除了上述所有功能外，你还可以轻松地复制保存代码片段，只需点击一下。

对于自定义，你可以调整字体大小和系列、切换自动换行、高亮显示行、使用单引号或添加尾随命令，这要归功于 Prettier。

此外，一份片段可以有多个分片。因此，它使你有机会将其用于各种用例。

如前所述，你也可以通过改变同步文件夹的存储位置将其与你的任何云同步服务整合。



总的来说，它工作得很好，有一些局限性，比如缺乏将嵌套文件夹从 SnippetsLab 迁移到 masCode 的能力。

在 Linux 上安装 massCode

massCode 有 Snap 包，但不在 Snap 商店中。你可以直接下载该软件包，并使用以下命令来安装它：

sudo snap install --dangerous ~/Downloads/masscode_2.6.1_amd64.snap


我们的一份故障排除指南可以帮助你了解 snap 的 dangerous 选项。

有时候，来自脚本的视觉回馈是很有用的。例如，当一个脚本或计划任务完成时，一个长期运行的构建任务失败时，或者当脚本执行中出现了紧急问题时。桌面应用程序可以通过弹出通知来做到这一点，但脚本也可以做到这一点！你可以使用脚本命令来给自己发送桌面通知与提醒。



下面的代码是在 Linux 上编写和测试的。它也可以在 macOS 上运行，只需花点功夫。请参见最后一节 提示与技巧。

从 Linux 终端发送通知

要从 Linux 终端发送通知，请使用 notify-send 命令。运行 which notify-send 命令来查看它是否在于你的系统中。如果没有，请使用包管理器来安装它。

在 Fedora 上，输入：

$ sudo dnf install notify-send


在基于 Debian 的发行版上，输入：

$ sudo apt install notify-send


几个简单的通知示例：

$ notify-send "Dinner ready!"
$ notify-send "Tip of the Day" "How about a nap?"


你可以用紧急程度、自定义图标等选项来自定义通知。过 man notify-send 了解更多。你也可以在通知正文中使用一小组 HTML 标记，以使消息有一个棒的视觉感受。最重要的是，URL 被呈现为可点击的。例如：

$ notify-send -u critical \
  "Build failed!" \
  "There were <b>123</b> errors. Click here to see the results: http://buildserver/latest"

《失落之城：四座世界古城的生与死》， [美] 安娜丽·纽伊茨著，朱敬文译，中信出版集团/新思文化，2022年6月版，78.00元
有些城市的生死命运经常不被关注，有可能是因为它们的规模、影响都比较小。当巨无霸式的中心大都市也出现政治危机、经济萧条、人口离散的迹象，却马上会成为预告某种趋势的象征，具有触目的警示意义。历史上那些曾经失落的伟大城市都经历过这样的演变进程，没有什么比伟大城市的衰亡故事更具有人类命运的象征意义。曾是文明的心脏，曾经以活力把无数人的生命点燃，最后为什么被掩埋在尘土之下？安娜丽·纽伊茨（Annalee Newitz）的《失落之城：四座世界古城的生与死》（原书名Four Lost Cities: A Secret History of the Urban Age ，2021；朱敬文译，中信出版社，2022年6月）把读者带到了遭遇政治动荡与自然灾害联手打击的城市衰亡历史现场，“它也将带来另一个反思：我们的城市是否也将在未来迎接一样落寞的终结？”这的确是值得推荐阅读的重要理由。

安娜丽·纽伊茨在该书中论述的第一个“失落之城”是建于约九千年前的新石器时代的恰塔霍裕克，这个遗址位于今天土耳其中部安纳托利亚地区的东西两座小山丘下。在这里顺带要说的是该书中译本的一个问题：书中所有的古代遗址与今天的地名以及所引述学者的人名后面都没有附上原文。当作者谈到这个“恰塔霍裕克”的住房户户相连、进出房屋要通过屋顶通道的楼梯口上下，我才想到所讲的这个遗址就是Çatalhöyük （Çatal Hüyük），中文译本多译作“加泰土丘”，我在大学二年级学世界史的时候看到的中译名则是“沙塔尔·休于”，那时还称其为“农村遗址”（《世界上古史纲》编写组《世界上古史纲》，上册，1979年，115页）。学术界关于这个遗址的性质是否属…]]></summary>

西安大雁塔与玄奘塑像
《西游记》是中国人家喻户晓的经典小说，讲的是唐僧师徒四人西天取经的故事，佛祖和观音为了考验取经团队，安排了很多妖怪一路阻挠，师徒四人一共经历了九九八十一难。其最后一难为“落水晒经书”，说的是通天河老鼋为师徒四人渡河帮忙，在河中间，老鼋问起自己拜托唐僧的事情，孰料唐僧忘记了，老鼋怒将师徒连同经书一同甩到河里，最后宝贵的经书虽然从河里捞出，却损毁了许多，留下无法弥补的缺憾。吴承恩以这个故事收尾既是基于历史上取经的一些事实，可能也寓有人生“抱残守缺”、实难圆满之意。国人都知《西游记》中的最后一难，却很少知道胡适先生曾经对这最后一难有过改作。以情节论，胡适的改作相当震撼，充满视觉想象力，如果将之改编为电影，说是一部限制级的暴力恐怖片也不为过。胡适如何想到改作《西游记》最后一难呢？大家知道，胡适在中国古代小说研究领域，是开风气之先的人物。他说：“十年前我曾对鲁迅先生说起《西游记》的第八十一难（九十九回）未免太寒碜了，应该大大的改作，才衬得住一部大书。我虽有此心，终无此闲暇，所以十年过去了，这件改作《西游记》的事终未实现。前几天，偶然高兴，写了这一篇，把《西游记》的第八十一难完全改作过了。”这篇文章发表于1934年的《学文月刊》上。

犹记二十年前，我在大学期间偶然读到胡适的这篇文章，印象远比“通天河遇鼋”来得深刻。其中诸多细节描写反映了胡适深厚的佛学造诣，隐伏着不少宗教意味。胡适在二十世纪二十至三十年代曾倾注了不少精力研究禅宗史，所以这篇改作也可算是他禅宗研究的成果。多年之后，我读到了罗马尼亚籍宗教史家米尔恰·伊利亚德（Mircea Eliade）的名著《萨满教：古老的入迷术》（Shamanism: Archaic Techniques of Ecstasy），联想起胡适改写的…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[北京大学历史学系 陈侃理
 来源：澎湃新闻
                
祝总斌先生家在中关园一幢老式的单元楼里。园子里草木葱茏，红砖外墙上长满了爬墙虎，颇有年代感。墙上纵横几道钢筋水泥的加固框架，有些煞风景，听说是唐山大地震后加上的。

我来北大念研究生时，祝先生已经退休有年，平时不容易在学校里见到。我便求着陈苏镇老师，哪回去看祝先生时带上我，让我见识见识这位写出了《两汉魏晋南北朝宰相制度研究》的大学者、老教授，导师的导师。陈老师似乎有些为难，但还是满足了我的愿望。
研究生拜访祝先生，右起：胡文波、王珊、孙正军、华喆、陈侃理，陈苏镇摄于2006年3月15日。
祝先生家比想象中要小。老户型三居室，客厅只容得下一张饭桌。三个房间，两间朝南的有一间做了书房，大约十二平米的样子。正中摆一张书桌，一把转椅，四壁都是书柜，顶天立地。进门处靠墙放了两只不大的单人沙发，沙发前有张茶几，茶几旁还有把铝合金折叠梯。这样，屋子就基本上挤满了，人在里面都转不开身。书桌、茶几、梯子上都放了书，堆得老高，更显得空间逼仄。回忆起来，祝先生就像是坐在书堆里。

那次的谈话，祝先生娓娓道来，跟我们聊了很多。内容不全记得了，但还能想起说了不少早年借书、读书、买书的事儿。我们问祝先生正在读什么书。祝先生兴致勃勃地讲起他的《红楼梦》研究，听着是“索隐派”的路数。第二年，这篇《董小宛入宫说始于何时》就发表了。
祝先生的书房，摄于2006年3月15日。

坐在书堆里的祝先生
过了几年，我毕业做博后，搬到中关新园宿舍，离祝先生家仅数十步之遥。那时先生八十岁了。我跟他说，我住得近，有什么可以帮忙的，您随时叫我。

那两年里，祝先生从来没有找过我。

直到留校工作，搬离中关新园，大约是2013年的一天，陈老师给我打电话，说祝先生在找你。我说，哦，是什么事儿啊？陈老师说，祝先生那儿有书让你去拿。我说，啊，这么好！到祝先生家，刚一落座，先生就指给我茶几上放好的几册精装书。有新城新藏的《东洋天文学史研究》、饭岛忠夫的《中国古代史と天文学》、能田忠亮的《东洋天文学史论丛》、陈遵妫的《中国天文学史》等，都是中国古代天文历法史的名著，但内容专深，是大多数历史学者不会碰的。有的书出版年代较早，还是日文版，在国内已属罕见。祝先生说：“你研究天文历法，用得着。”那时，我刚开始学习一点粗浅的历法知识，所谓“研究”还毫无眉目。翻看着书中祝先生的划线和批注，我吞吞吐吐地问：“这书，您不用了？”祝先生声音响亮，说：“我过去想研究，现在研究不动了。把书给你，希望你用得上，写出好文章来！”
祝总斌先生1980年购买的能田忠亮《东洋天文学史论丛》一书
书后来真的用上了。可几年之后我写出文章时，祝先生行动已经很不方便。我实在想象不出他在昏暗的书房里读那些文字的样子，也始终没有鼓起勇气问一句：“祝先生，您对文章有什么意见？”

那回同去的还有文超，祝先生给他选好了秦汉简牍方面的书。另有一套自创刊号以下完整无缺的《古文字研究》，托我转交给出土文献研究所。我们拿上书，先生又带着我们到各个屋里转，一会儿说：“这里的书好，你们要不要？”一会儿说：“来来来，看看这儿有什么，尽管挑，尽管拿。”我们就不客气了，各取所爱，卷走不少。这次我注意到，两个卧室里能放书柜的地方都放着书柜，每个书柜都塞得满满当当——甚至经我们席卷过后，看起来仍是满的。

后来依旧很少到祝先生家去，算来总数可能不会超过十次。去得频繁，是在2020年末到2021年初。连续三次，都是祝先生叫我去拿书。

那个冬天，四壁书柜里的书开始松动了。原来放成两排的，显露出藏在后面那排，有些书搬到地上，码得有半人高，有的已经装进纸箱、袋子。祝先生坐在轮椅里，划着圈儿到处指着，说：“你去那儿翻翻，这是不是你有用的。……阳台上也有。……对了，去隔壁看看，那儿还有历法、科技方面的书。”

我带了宜家的超大购物袋去，再要往里装时却有点迟疑。因为药物副作用，祝先生抬头很困难，我就蹲下来，跟他说话。讲了不多几句，他又催促我：“快，再去找找，再拿几本！”我慢慢起身，站在书柜前出神。这时，祝先生用力转过脸，歪着头，带着笑，大声说：“红粉送佳人，宝剑赠英雄。拿去就对了！”
祝先生1959年购买的《九朝律考》封面、扉页

祝先生在《九朝律考》书中的批注，可能是研究晋律“儒家化”的准备工作。
书柜一次比一次空了……

我明白，这是祝先生在预备他的告别。以学术研究为生命的人，书也是他的生命。他要在有可能的时候，给他的书最好的安排，把最看重的宝贝送给需要的人。

祝先生走了。但拿到他书的人，各自得到了他的一部分生命。

岂止是拿到他的书的人。

听过他课的人、读过他书的人、感受到他无私的爱的人，也都得到了他的一部分生命。

查了查记录。

最后一次去祝先生家拿书，是2021年1月11日。

从《代码大全》 到 StackOverflow 大师

后来，当我在北京找到第一份工作时，学会了 Perl 语言，编写了我的第一个 CGI 程序（互动网页），编程于是成为了我吃饭的本领。

上世纪末，互联网刚刚在国内兴起，人们编程时所能求助的外援，大多是各种语言手册、类库大全等书籍。这其中有一本著名的大部头被很多程序员置于案头，它就是《代码大全》，这本书里面提供了很多有用的、精妙的编程示例和技巧。往往在遇到编程难点时，程序员们可以“复制”书中的一些最佳实践来解决。



随着互联网的普及，逐渐出现了 Stack Overflow 之类的编程类问答网站。程序员们惊喜的发现，原来很多困扰自己的编程难题都可以在网上找到答案，且点赞数较高的代码示例比自己写的还要好。于是乎，很多“程序员”变成了“谷歌程序员”/“百度程序员”，搜索、复制，然后粘贴就好了。以至于，StackOverflow 在某年愚人节的 恶作剧 说，它将限制对其网站的免费访问，除非人们购买“钥匙”：一个带有“打开 Stack Overflow”、“复制”和“粘贴”的按钮的设备，算是对这种直接复制、粘贴的做法表达了一种冷幽默。最有趣的是，居然有热心网友联合键盘定制厂商，真将这块特别的键盘定制出来了，并以 29 美元出售。



程序员们是否越来越成为一种熟练工？

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm a more recent Linux user (about 4 months) and one of the things I'm struggling with is over updating. Essentially every time I sit down my brain goes "oops! Better check for updates! Wouldn't want to be out of date!" And even I can say I'm being excessive. I use Debian/Debian based distros, so those aren't as bleeding edge as others. How often do you need to update to stay safe? Would I be able to go a week? A month? A year, without updating? I know the Arch guys update every other second, but for something less bleeding edge, what would you say would be a proper amount of time before checking for updates, or updating your system?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Over the last five decades or so, free and open-source software (FOSS) has
gone from an almost unknown 
quantity available to only the most technically savvy to underpinning much
of the infrastructure we rely on today.  Much like software itself, FOSS is
"eating the world".  But that has changed—is changing—the role of the
maintainers of all of that code; when "critical" infrastructure uses code
from a FOSS project, suddenly, and perhaps without warning, that code
itself becomes critical.  But many maintainers of that software are
volunteers who did not set out to become beholden to the needs of large
companies and organizations when they released their code, they were just
scratching their itch—now lots of others are clamoring for theirs to be
scratched as well.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello all! Despite my several year usage of Linux and passion for programming, I've not yet delved into the depths of several aspects of Linux itself. I'm working on that now.
 As I come across environment variables, it strikes me that there's so much potential! And it strikes me as interesting that they're not typed whatsoever (useful for quick/dirty scripts, for sure). 
 I've not had much success in searching (although I found GNU's Guile, which looks interesting; maybe not entirely related) but I'm interested to know:
 What is the state of the art in using environment variables for more sophisticated scripts/programming? It seems, for example, that we could create an entire DSL (Domain Specific Language) within such variables that could be changed at runtime -- it seems that having these variables typed would be of interest, it seems that error-checking would be desirable (e.g., if we set an environment variable in a way that depends on an external network call, we want to know if it failed or not) -- again, it seems that there'd be so much potential! 
 I'm certain I'm not the first to think of this, so I'm wondering what experience in these matters exist. Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I created a web page to compare different analytical databases (both self-managed and services, open-source and proprietary) on a realistic dataset.
It contains 20+ databases, each with installation and data loading scripts. And they can be compared to each other on a set of 43 queries, by data load time or by storage size.
There are switches to select different types of databases for comparison - for example, only MySQL compatible or PostgreSQL compatible.
If you play with the switches, many interesting details will be uncovered.

 TL;DR : Ubuntu hasn't contributed ANYTHING to desktop linux in 8+ years, while red hat and fedora has brought us modern Gnome, Wayland, Fwupd, libinput, Pipewire, and Flatpak.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[微软仍计划默认屏蔽下载的 Office 文件中的宏

多年来，黑客们经常用恶意的宏来攻击 Office 文件。微软原本计划要求 Office 用户在打开从互联网下载的 Office 文件时，通过在文件属性中专门勾选一个解禁选项来启用宏程序。之前计划在 6 月份实施。但微软在 6 月 30 日突然撤销了这一阻止。微软解释称，“根据用户的反馈，我们暂时回退了这一变化，同时我们做了一些额外的改变以提高可用性。”目前，Office 用户可以简单地在文件顶部的横幅上点击一个启用按钮。微软称，“这是一个临时的变化，我们完全致力于为所有用户进行默认的改变。”


消息来源：The Verge



老王点评：宏给 Office 带来的好处不如它带来的问题更多，这一举措确实有助于微软提供更好的产品体验。




PyPI 将向关键项目赠送 4000 个安全密钥

PyPI 由 Python 软件基金会（PSF）管理，是 Python 开发人员获得第三方开发的开源包的主要仓库。这些库的安全影响到了整个 Python 生态的安全，PSF 现在强制要求“关键项目”的开发人员在未来几个月内使用双因素认证（2FA），这使得开发人员可以保护自己难于盗取凭证。任何在过去六个月里下载量排名前 1% 的项目将被视作关键项目，有超过 3800 个项目被评为“关键”，这涉及到 8241 个 PyPI 用户。作为 PSF 的赞助商，谷歌开源安全团队提供了 4000 个谷歌泰坦安全密钥，以分发给这些维护者。PyPI 数据显示，目前有 28336 个用户启用了 2FA，其中近 27000 个用户使用的是像“微软验证器”这样的 2FA 应用。


消息来源：ZDNet



老王点评：虽然 2FA 密钥不能完全避免被盗取凭证，但是却可提供大部分保护。




美国企业领导人敦促加强计算机科学教育

超过 500 名美国的商业、教育和非营利组织领导人发表了一封公开信，呼吁美国各州政府和教育负责人为全美的 K-12 学生提供更多的计算机科学教育。他们称，“美国在技术方面领先世界，但我们的高中生中只有 5% 学习计算机科学。这怎么能接受呢？……近三分之二的高技能移民是计算机科学家，每个州都是这种战略人才的进口商。美国有超过 70 万个开放的计算机职位，但每年只有 8 万名计算机科学毕业生。”


消息来源：Geek Wire



老王点评：从这个风向标来看，学计算机还是挺有前景的，当然，我建议你留着国内发展。]]></summary>

Good Pop Bad Pop: An Inventory, by Jarvis Cocker, Jonathan Cape, May 2022, 368pp
贾维斯·科克（Jarvis Cocker）总是被边缘事物所吸引：那些不时髦的、被忽视的、被改变用途的或者过时的东西。他在“果浆”（Pulp）乐队时曾唱过：“奇形怪状、一错再错、格格不入，噢我们看上去和你们不一样。”正如科克在他迷人而杂乱无章的回忆录《好流行坏流行》中对我们讲述的那样，他在很小的时候就被灌输了这种既具有发掘性，又置身事外的美学。他还在读书时就打算要成立一支乐队，名为“果浆”（一开始打算叫它“阿拉比卡式果浆”——“我想这与咖啡有点关系”）。选择这个名字是因为它似乎概括了他的整个计划：“流行（pop）和果浆（pulp）对我来说是可以互换的词汇。”

然而，就科克对其艺术的专注而言，并没有什么是随随便便的。在果浆乐队终于凭借其辉煌而且长盛不衰的专辑《不同阶级》（Different Class，1995年）而大放异彩之前，他们已经用各种方式在边缘摸爬滚打了十五年。他们早期的一次成功是1981年登上约翰·皮尔（John Peel）的BBC广播一套节目，随后又销声匿迹十二年。“在这样的过渡期里我能做什么？”科克语带挖苦地自问。

答案是慢慢地把各种事物整合起来，尝试，失败，然后再来。另外还有，自我放逐。科克复述了一个他以前讲过（包括在“孤岛唱片”里）的故事：1985年，他试图爬进一个女孩的公寓起居室的窗户来打动她。结果很糟糕，他摔断了几根骨头。这是科克的“大马士革之路”时刻：经历不幸通向荣耀。在漫长而沉闷的复健过程中，他意识到了生活其实一直在身边——而这将是他的灵感来源。他开始听巴里·怀特（Barry White）的歌：“音乐上影响我的重要人物之一。” 

《好流行坏流行》在此之后很快就收尾了，而科克在很久以后才成了明星。这本书的目的是记录“启动我创造力的最初尝试”。早在怀特、灵魂乐和Funk音乐之前，科克就尝试过朋克——这对年轻的他来说尤其有吸引力，因为他从未学习过“以传统方式阅读或书写音乐”，总是倾向于将姿势置于技术能力之上。对他来说，这一切都始于审美：慈善商店的衣服、“破烂”的领带、醒目的标志、饱含意图的声明。然后，他要做的就是“开始写几首歌”。

《好流行坏流行》不是一本通常的回忆录，它在结构上好比参观科克的阁楼，看着他筛选生涯中的碎屑。随着回忆的绽放，他也邀请我们玩一个“丢或留”的游戏（书中的“丢弃”用了谢菲尔德俚语“cob”）。他是不是应该保留那些旧演唱会门票、读书时候的照片、内置鼓机的“天才”牌磁带录音机呢？当然啦。那块贴着老式标签的“帝国皮革”牌香皂呢？很遗憾，到了丢掉它的时候了。读者很快就会清楚看到，对废弃物品的喜爱使科克成为一个天生的囤积狂。他也是一个“对变化深恶痛绝”的人，尽管这非常不朋克。

这种旧货铺的淘宝之旅有时会接近于《捕蜂器》（The Wasp Factory）的那种平庸，用科克自己的话来说，是筛找“通灵的苗头”——他热衷于点评社会趋势（“我们生活在一个属于谷歌的时代”）和老头子式的宣言（“性是两个人一起做的事情”）强化了这一印象。科克是一位优秀的词作家，善于运用难忘的场景、愉悦的并列和巧妙的转折；他写的流行歌曲明快悦耳而不落俗套。但作为一个回忆录作者，他并未充分展示自己。我还想进一步了解小摆设背后的那个人。

尽管如此，我们还是能勉力勾勒出简单肖像：一个充满爱心的谢菲尔德人，由一位顽强的单身母亲抚养长大；1980年代依靠派发传单做广告的地下音乐世界；还有科克的音乐历程，从学校里登台的糟糕演出到更好的酒吧献艺，以及他从正规教育中辍学，签约后住到一个棚屋里（正如忧心忡忡的母亲爱唠叨的“从大学预科到垃圾堆”）讨生活。我们读到了其他对他有影响的人，从埃尔维斯·科斯特洛和劳里·安德森，还有斯科特·沃克和马克·E.史密斯。以及一些不可错过的轶事，特别是关于他著名的眼镜。他从小深度近视，当他五岁得到第一副眼镜的时候，世界突然清晰了。“啊，树上原来有那么多洞！”贾维斯·科克心目中的另一位英雄人物莱昂纳德·科恩可能会回嘴：“万物皆有缝隙，不然光怎么照进来。”

（一）

英国初夏的晴日黄昏，最为宜人。前几周的白金禧庆全然落幕，伦敦回到从前。路上行人匆匆，公园里则游客慵懒，或坐或躺，或悠闲漫步，夕阳将长长的身影投到草地上。

从格林地铁站前往佳士得拍卖行在圣詹姆士的总部，五分钟的路程，可以走车水马龙的大路，经过富丽堂皇的丽兹酒店，也可走行人稀少的小路,从公园进入两家花园之间仅够一人通过的窄巷（后来看地图才知道这条小巷居然有名有姓，还是皇家身份，叫Queen’s Psge，可谓是女王胡同），再走过两家低调但极致优雅的传统饭店。佳士得对面的酒吧里客人多多，站满了人行道，拍卖行入口这边也拉起了围绳，排出了一条不短的队伍。每季大拍前的预展和酒会，原本是日常，但6月8日的这个夜场，是两年多来疫情后重启的首次，自然吸引了众多参观者。大家也都一番打扮，女士长裙飘逸，男士穿正装衬衫，见不到牛仔裤和运动鞋。

这场活动的主题，是“文学的艺术”。几年前，佳士得曾有过一场主题为“看东方”的夜场酒会，木版教育信托有幸作为嘉宾参加，拍卖行给了我们一个C位的展场，展览了二十幅“木版画原作集六十家”的版画，信托的理事、版画家何为民在展厅里做了木刻版画工作坊，进行了刻印演示并与观众互动，结束时展场中到处都是穿着时尚小心翼翼捧着自己印制的版画的伦敦美女，一时传为佳话。今年这晚“文学的艺术”，也有诗歌朗诵等许多活动，其中最重要的，是旅英艺术家曲磊磊的书法工作坊。大展室的四壁上挂着磊磊老师的书画作品，两张长长的桌子上铺开了大幅宣纸，摆好了数套笔墨。英国北京艺术团国画班的几十位学员前去参加活动，有趣的是，课程一直在线上进行，这也是许多学生第一次得见磊磊老师真容。曲磊磊挥毫演示、耐心讲解，中外弟子和其他参观者也在巨幅宣纸长卷上各显神通，可谓这个艺术之夜的高潮。

无论你有多少存储空间，了解文件占用了多少磁盘空间都是一个重要的考虑事项。我的笔记本有一个相对较小的 250GB NVME 驱动器，大多数时候都没什么问题，但几年前我开始探索 Linux 上的游戏，情况变得有所不同，安装 Steam 和其他游戏使存储管理更加重要。

du 命令

检查磁盘驱动器上剩余存储空间最简单的方法是 du 命令。它会估计文件空间使用情况，像其他所有 Linux 工具一样，du 非常强大，但学会如何根据你的特定需求使用它会很有帮助。我总是查阅手册页来掌握实用程序的用法。du 有几个选项，可以为你提供文件存储的最佳快照，以及它们在系统上消耗多少空间。

du 命令有很多选项，以下是一些常见的：


-a - 包括文件夹和文件在内的存储信息

--apparent-size - 打印自身大小而不是占用磁盘量

-h - 人类可读的格式

-b - 以字节为单位

-c - 总计

-k - 以块为单位

-m - 以兆字节为单位的大小


务必查看 du 手册页获取完整帮助列表。

显示所有文件

你可以选择的第一个选项是 du -a，它可以显示系统上所有文件及其存储目录的大小。这个命令让我知道了我的主目录中存储了 11555168 个字节。使用 du -a 可以快速递归地查看我的存储系统。如果我想要一个更有意义的数字，并且我想深入到目录中查看大文件的位置，该怎么办？

我认为在 Downloads 目录下有一些大文件，所以我输入 du -a /home/don/Downloads 来查看。

$ du -a ~/Downloads
4923    ./UNIX_Driver_5-0/UNIX Driver 50

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Internxt 发布了一个新产品，它可以让你快速地将加密文件发送给任何人，同时保持你的隐私。嗯，我们只能希望它不会像 Firefox Send 那样关闭吧……




Internxt 是一个相当新的开源加密云服务，旨在取代大型科技公司的产品。例如，你可以把它作为谷歌的相册和云端硬盘的替代品。

它免费提供 10 GB 的容量。所以，如果感兴趣的话，你可以注册个账号试一试。

最近，他们还新增了另一个产品 “Internxt Send”，作为 Firefox Send 的替代品，填补这个空缺。

唉，说到这里还挺遗憾的，Firefox Send 已停止服务了，不得不说它是一个很好的工具！

不过，Internxt Send 让你可以像 Firefox Send 一样安全地发送/共享图像、视频、文档和其他文件。

Internxt Send：一个安全的文件共享服务



我在 GitHub 上找不到 Internxt Send 的存储库，但我已经要求他们澄清了。

（LCTT 译注：虽然 Internxt 是在 GitHub 上开源的，但是 GitHub 上没有 Internxt Send 这个产品的存储库，产品的介绍里也没有声称它是开源的。）

正如你所期望的那样，你无需创建帐户即可将文件上传到 Internxt Send。

文件上传限制为 5 GB。而且，你不能以任何方式提高这个限制。

你可以选择文件，上传并生成共享链接。或者，你也可以直接向收件人发送电子邮件，那样的话，你需要在邮件里分享你的电子邮件地址。



有趣的是，它还允许你在这个电子邮件中添加自定义文本。

与 Firefox Send 不同的是，你无法修改文件共享链接的到期时间，或者是让它在多次下载后失效。默认情况下，链接会在 15 天后过期，你无法更改这个时间。嗯，这还挺扫兴的。

但是，对于那些正在苦苦等待一个加密的共享文件服务的人来说，这可能是一种替代方案。

我认为有更多的 Firefox Send 替代品是件好事！你对 Internxt Send 有何看法？欢迎在下方评论区里和大家分享。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I spent a year avoiding Ubuntu whilst dual booting because it got like a quarter of the battery life as Windows. I had to go around hunting to find out about this TLP thing, and it works like a miracle you install it and you start it and you get a dramatic increase in battery life without any noticeable impact in functionality. It's pretty amazing but
 why is this not built in?
 I just recently clean installed Ubuntu 22.04, and I noticed they added some power management to the settings. I think to myself "it's about gosh darn time" then just today I'm sitting there not even watching videos I'm just browsing the web and after an hour, half of my battery is gone.
 I do a little research and it turns out the power management they included is rubbish. All it really does is CPU throttling. I remove it and install TLP and the battery reports going from 8 watts at idle down to 6 Watts.
 The battery life on Ubuntu out of the box on a laptop is so bad it's going to turn people away why would they not include TLP by default when being installed bare metal on a laptop?
 (I haven't really tried any other distributions on battery so I can't speak to anything other than Ubuntu but I read Fedora has a similar issue)

I type in sudo apt install firefox AND IT INSTALLS THE FUCKING SNAP PACKAGE. I also didnt realize how bad the preformace was of snaps. Both flatpaks and snaps are awful in terms of desktop integration.
 Dear canonical i switched to fedora because it gives me a choice. (and also because snaps just kinda suck in every way)

I've been offered a position at Microsoft to do kernel development work. This would be a big transition to me, coming from a services background (backend only).
The job's main draw to me is doing low-level work. I did some in my very first job, but for the past 10+ years, due to a number of circumstances, I've been in the services world. I really liked being a C programmer and I've kept an eye on things over the years, and did some hobby projects (on x86 and some embedded stuff as well).
There's a lot about my current job that I treasure, despite the work itself not being interesting to me about 99% of the time. It's a remote job, the work-life balance is stellar, and I get 25 days of vacation a year (this is in the US), which allows me to spend a lot o…]]></summary>

mailing list that started as a query about adding support for custom

frequently used for handling units and unit conversion in C++, so the
Python discussion fairly quickly focused on that use case.  While ideas about a
possible feature were batted about, it does not seem like anything that is
being pursued in earnest, at least at this point.  But some of the facets

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Some researchers at ETH Zurich have disclosed a
new set of speculative-execution vulnerabilities known as "Retbleed".  In
short, the retpoline defenses added when Spectre was initially disclosed
turn out to be insufficient on x86 machines because return instructions,
too, can be speculatively executed.


	​Kernel and hypervisor developers have developed mitigations in
	coordination with Intel and AMD. Mitigating Retbleed in the Linux
	kernel required a substantial effort, involving changes to 68
	files, 1783 new lines and 387 removed lines. Our performance
	evaluation shows that mitigating Retbleed has unfortunately turned
	out to be expensive: we have measured between 14% and 39% overhead
	with the AMD and Intel patches respectively.


Those mitigations were pulled into the mainline
kernel today.  They are 
not in the July 12 stable kernel
updates but will almost certainly show up in those channels soon.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[WebAssembly is a modern bytecode supported by all browsers and designed to be a compiler target for a wide variety of programming languages.
To effectively support some forms of Functional Programming support for tail-calls has been proposed as an extension to the WebAssembly standard.
This proposal has reached Phase3 of the standardization process years ago, but has since stalled.
Phase3 is known as "the implementation phase" and the prerequisite for advancing the proposal to Phase4 is to have support in two different browser engines. V8/Chrome support has been available for a long time, so another engine is required.
To unblock this situation we have contributed full support for WebAssembly Tail Calls to JavaScript/WebKit/Safari. The PR is available here:
https://github.com/WebKit/WebKit/pull/2065
An in-depth article about the challenges of implementing this feature is also available. This is intended both as documentation for our contribution, but also as a general explainer about how tails calls actually work, with a particular focus on stack space management.

科学家找到了一类量子算法可以解决的新问题

1994 年数学家 Peter Shor 想出了如何让量子计算机完成普通经典计算机无法做到的事情。原则上，一台基于量子规则的机器可有效地将大数分解为质因数，这对于经典计算机来说，这是一项非常困难的任务。但三十年来，科学家们仅在一个被称为 NP 的标准集中发现了一个单一的、狭窄的问题类别可以显著加速。今年四月，科学家们又发现了一类量子计算可以以指数级速度解决的问题：它涉及仅根据混乱的输出来计算复杂数学过程的输入。


消息来源：Solidot



老王点评：目前看起来量子计算还只能用在很狭窄的领域，什么时候可以进行通用计算，或许带来的是颠覆性的变化，对这一天，我是又期盼，又恐惧。

安全研究人员发布了他们使用手持无线电解锁和远程启动几辆本田汽车的视频，他们称，这是因为 2012 年至今 10 年间生产的许多本田汽车的无钥匙进入系统存在漏洞。这种攻击使用无线电设备记录来自钥匙扣的合法无线电信号，然后将其传送到汽车上。这被称为重放攻击。理论上，每个信号应该只起一次作用；当按下按钮解锁汽车时，车就会解锁并且这个信号不应该再次用于解锁。但安全研究人员发现，这种攻击之所以奏效是因为它能够重新同步汽车的计数器，使之可以接受旧的代码。但本田否认了这一漏洞。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[当地时间12日，推特公司正式起诉特斯拉公司首席执行官埃隆·马斯克，要求他以440亿美元的价格收购这家社交媒体公司。
　　根据法庭文件，推特指控马斯克违反收购合同这一行为是“虚伪和恶意的”，并要求他以440亿美元的价格收购这家社交媒体公司。
　　法庭文件显示，“2022年4月，埃隆·马斯克与推特签订了协议，承诺将尽最大努力完成交易。现在，不到三个月后，马斯克拒绝履行对推特及其股东的义务，因为他签署的交易不再符合他的个人利益。”
　　在推特提起诉讼后不久，马斯克在推特上发文称，“哦，真讽刺，哈哈哈。”
　　据此前报道，当地时间8日，马斯克表示因为推特严重违反了收购协议中的多项条款，所以将终止对推特的收购。据悉，根据该协议条款，如果马斯克退出收购，需要支付推特10亿美元。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ubuntu 22.04 LTS 是迄今为止最好的 Ubuntu 版本之一。是什么让它如此安全？




早在今年 4 月就发布了的 Ubuntu 22.04 LTS，是迄今为止最安全的 Ubuntu 版本。

其安全更新的延长支持、新的硬件支持和其他林林总总的改进，使它在安全方面远远超过了之前的所有版本。

但它是如何做到这一点的呢？还有，是什么让这个版本与以前的版本不同的呢？

嗯，有几个原因，Canonical 在一篇新的博客文章中为我们重点指出了这些。在这里，让我总结一下，以帮助你了解更多。

是什么让 Ubuntu 22.04 LTS 变得安全？

在这个版本中，Ubuntu 团队似乎投入了大量的工作来确保其长期的安全性和可靠性。尽管多年来他们以难以想象的方式做到了这一点，但我将强调其中的几件事：


改进的硬件安全措施支持

更新了安全包

私有家目录

OpenSSL 3

GCC 11

nftables 作为默认的防火墙后端

Linux 内核改进


1、改进的硬件安全措施支持



随着英特尔、AMD 和 ARM 的 CPU/SoC 开始推出更多的安全措施，拥有足够的软件来让这些功能发挥作用就变得越来越重要。

截至目前，Ubuntu 22.04 支持三种主要的硬件安全措施。

英特尔的 “软件保护扩展Software Guard eXtensions”（SGX）提供了一个安全独立的区域来进行敏感计算。例如，理想情况下，密码处理将在这里进行，因为它确保没有其他应用程序可以访问这些数据。

还有 AMD 的“安全加密虚拟化Secure Encrypted Virtualization”（SEV）。这项技术旨在防止主机操作系统干扰正在运行的虚拟机。

尽管这与桌面用户的相关性不如其他技术，但要知道，很多数据中…]]></summary>

 Zorin Menu and Zorin Taskbar were 100% original extensions developed by Artyom for the ZorinOS and Dash to Panel and Arc Menu are forks of these 2 extensions developed by Zorin. Later Arc Menu and Dash to Panel got a lot more popular and a cyclic contribution started between Arc Menu and Zorin Menu.
 To learn that Gnome wouldn't have had a taskbar or start menu if not for ZorinOS is kinda mind blowing.

使用 C 编写的应用程序时，通常有多个源码文件，但最终你需要编译成单个的可执行文件。

你可以通过两种方式来完成这项工作：通过创建一个 静态static 库 或 一个 动态dynamic 库（也被称为 共享shared 库）。从创建和链接的方式来看，它们是两种不同类型的库。选择使用哪种方式取决于你的的具体场景。

在 上一篇文章 中，我演示了如何创建一个动态链接的可执行文件，这是一种更通用的方法。在这篇文章中，我将说明如何创建一个静态链接的可执行文件。

使用静态库链接器

链接器linker是一个命令，它将一个程序的多个部分结合在一起，并为它们重新组织内存分配。

链接器的功能包括：


整合一个程序的所有的部分

计算出一个新的内存组织结构，以便所有的部分组合在一起

恢复内存地址，以便程序可以在新的内存组织结构下运行

解析符号引用


链接器通过这些功能，创建了一个名称为可执行文件的一个可运行程序。

静态库是通过复制一个程序中的所有依赖库模块到最终的可执行镜像来创建的。链接器将链接静态库作为编译过程的最后一步。可执行文件是通过解析外部引用、将库例程与程序代码结合在一起来创建的。

创建目标文件

这里是一个静态库的示例以及其链接过程。首先，创建带有这些函数识别标志的头文件 mymath.h :

int add(int a, int b);
int sub(int a, int b);
int mult(int a, int b);
int divi(int a, int b);


使用这些函数定义来创建 add.c 、sub.c 、mult.c 和 divi.c 文件。我将把所有的代码都放置到一个代码块中，请将其分为四个文件，如注释所示：…]]></summary>

《创造现代世界：英国启蒙运动钩沉》，[英]罗伊·波特著，李源、张恒杰、李上、刘北成译，商务印书馆2022年2月出版，810页，228.00元
由于教学与研究的需要，我经常会将罗伊·波特的Enlightenment: Britain and the Creation of the Modern World（The Penguin Press，2000年）拿出来阅读参考，在上海疫情期间，得知此书已被刘北成教授主持翻译为中文出版，书名为《创造现代世界：英国启蒙运动钩沉》，欣喜之余，深感此书值得一读。

此书作者罗伊·波特受业于剑桥大学，曾经跟随“剑桥学派”代表性人物昆廷·斯金纳研习思想史，后转向医学社会史研究，其学术成果显著，声誉隆盛，以至于现在学界很多人常常认为他是医学社会史研究领域的权威。其实，在很长一段时间里，他仍然耕耘在思想史领域，特别是十八世纪启蒙运动史。据我所知，在这本Enlightenment: Britain and the Creation of the Modern World之后，他又出版了《启蒙运动》（2001年，北京大学出版社于2018年出版中文版）和Flesh in the Age of Reason: How the Enlightenment Transformed the Way We See Our Bodies and Souls（Penguin Press，2004年）等。
罗伊·波特
从学术维度上看，启蒙运动是一个学术积累丰厚，但也富有争议的领域。自上个世纪八十年代以来，学者日益拓展了启蒙运动的研究领域：一是打破了过去以法国启蒙运动为中心的旧有范式，将启蒙运动看作为复数，重新发现了启蒙运动在各个国家展开的不同样式，如苏格兰启蒙运动，意大利启蒙运动等。二为注重…]]></summary>

今年，该项目向 18 岁或以上的任何人开放 —— 不仅限于学生和应届毕业生了。参与者通过编写软件获得报酬，其 津贴 的金额取决于他们所在国家/地区的 购买力平价。

LCTT 译注：以往，这个活动只允许在校学生参与，今年条件放开，只需年龄 18+ 即可，对参与者的贡献时长要求也降低了，尽可能地让更多人参与进来。不过，今年的报名通道在 4 月 19 日就截止了，大家有兴趣的话明年可以关注一下。

这也是 Zephyr 项目第一次作为 Linux 基金会的项目，参与到谷歌编程之夏中。让我们一起欢迎这些贡献者及其项目吧！

项目一：基于 Zephyr 的 Arduino 模块

1 个贡献者（350 小时）。

Arduino 是一个流行的框架，它为嵌入式设备编程提供了一个简化的接口。最近，Arduino 采用 mbed OS 作为其一些新设备的基础 RTOS。通过这项工作，他们将 Arduino Core 作为独立的抽象层，从 Arduino Core for mbed 中分离出来。这为在其他操作系统上利用 Arduino Core 开辟了可能性。

该项目的想法就是创建一个利用 Arduino Core 的 Zephyr 模块，以便开发人员在与 Arduino 兼容的设备上使用 Arduino 框架时，可以使用 Zephyr 作为底层操作系统。对用户的好处包括：


可以访问 Arduino API 以及高级 Zephyr 功能

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[TL;DR: I was recomended CentOs and I was curious what you guys thought about it. 
 My grandfather was a computer wiz. He coded for the military, Atari and IBM back in the day, his preferred work machine was Redhat before he died. My main machine runs mint(no particular reason, just the first one I installed in highschool and what I tend to go back to after distri hopping). Before he died, he recommended I try CentOS since its “more or less free Redhat”. I never thought about it too much, but I’ve been thinking about him and wanted to give Cent a shot. I of course did some googling but I was curious what the community thought about Cent and Redhat.

 installed ubuntu mate on it so it runs faster 
 only problem, linux works a little differently than windows: it doesn’t “get what you mean” ie you have to figure out how to tell it exactly what you want 
 nothing works the way u expect etc. however, there are lots of linux forums full of how to fix the same problem you’re having 
 In general I think installing linux on a slow PC instead of buying a new PC is a horrible idea if you’re not a tech person. you’re definitely better off troubleshooting windows than ubuntu mate imo 
 do not be like me and install faster linux os without creating windows 11 recovery drive first

马斯克曾多次公开表示，他希望知道有多少推特账户是由机器人运营的，因为他觉得可疑账户的数量影响了公司的价值。因此他寻求检测和处理虚假账户的方法。当推特最终提供了马斯克明确要求的 8 个开发者 API 的访问权时，这些 API 的速率限制低于推特向其最大企业客户提供的速率限制。马斯克称，这使得他们无法在任何合理的时间内完成数据分析。

许多老的 X.Org 组件在本周末有新的发布

上周末，Oracle 的长期 X.Org 贡献者 Alan Coopersmith 对各种旧的、很少维护的 X.Org 项目发布了许多新的更新。这些软件多年来没有任何更新，新的版本大多只是收集了过去几年中的一些随机修复。总的来说，这些更新并没有什么值得兴奋的改进。


消息来源：Phoronix



老王点评：这是觉得 X.org 快被放弃了才最后抢救一次？从另外一方面看，可见 X.org 社区有多冷清了。连随手收到的一些修复都懒得发布个新版本。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[On his blog, Armin Ronacher comments about a recent security key giveaway by the Python Package Index (PyPI) to provide two-factor authentication (2FA) tokens to the maintainers of the "critical" projects on the index.  While (eventually) requiring maintainers to use 2FA before being able to update PyPI packages is reasonable, Ronacher worries about where the idea might lead:


Instead of putting the burden to the user of packages, we're now piling stuff onto the developer who already puts their own labor and time into it. From the index' point of view there is a benefit to not enforce rules on everybody as some of these rules might make the use of the index burdensome, but putting the burden only on critical packages does not hurt the adoption just as much. As mentioned earlier I would not make the case that 2FA is not burdensome, it's a sensible thing. But clearly the index considers it burdensome enough to not enforce it for everybody. More importantly though is what could come next.

There is a hypothetical future where the rules tighten. One could imagine that an index would like to enforce cryptographic signing of newly released packages. Or the index wants to enable reclaiming of critical packages if the author does not respond or do bad things with the package. For instance a critical package being unpublished is a problem for the ecosystem. One could imagine a situation where in that case the Index maintainers take over the record of that package on the index to undo the damage. Likewise it's more than imaginable that an index of the future will require packages to enforce a minimum standard for critical packages such as a certain SLO for responding to critical incoming requests (security, trademark laws etc.).]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[据第一财经，近日，有网友在社交平台称，此前与支付宝合作的盛京银行目前无法提现。盛京银行回应称，已停止通过支付宝平台销售存款产品。
　　对此，第一财经记者致电盛京银行，盛京银行回复称：“根据监管9号文要求，我行已停止通过支付宝平台销售存款产品，仅保留通过支付宝平台为存量客户提供余额查询、购买明细查询、提前支取等服务；按照支付宝平台规则，相关服务操作时间为北京时间每日07:00-23:00。”
　　2021年1月15日，银保监会、央行发布《关于规范商业银行通过互联网开展个人存款业务有关事项的通知》（银保监办发[2021]9号，下称《通知》），明确指出商业银行不得通过非自营网络平台开展定期存款和定活两便存款业务，包括但不限于由非自营网络平台提供营销宣传、产品展示、信息传输、购买入口、利息补贴等服务。
　　由此，第三方平台开始下架存款产品。
　　2021年，沈阳国资两次增持盛京银行股份，成为盛京银行第一大股东。
　　官网资料显示，盛京银行总部位于辽宁省沈阳市，前身是沈阳市商业银行，2007年2月经中国银监会批准更名为盛京银行，是东北地区实力雄厚的总部银行。2014年12月29日，该行在香港联合交易所主板成功上市。
　　从经营情况来看，2021年，盛京银行实现营收154.67亿元，同比下降4.9%；实现净利润4.31亿元，同比下降65%。截至2021年末，该行资产总额为10061.26亿元，较上年末减少3.1%。
　　资产质量方面，拨备覆盖率130.87%，较上年末提高16.82个百分点。资本充足率方面，截至去年末该行核心一级资本充足率和一级资本充足率均为10.54%，资本充足率为12.12%，满足监管要求。
　　值得关注的是，2021年9月29日，沈阳盛京金控投资集团有限公司曾受让恒大集团（南昌）有限公司所持有的盛京银行19.93%股份，成为盛京银行第一大股东。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[本文列出了 2022 年可以用于不同情况的 10 个 Ubuntu 优选应用。


如果你计划永久的转移到 Linux 系统上，你应该会很高兴地知道在 Linux 上有数以千计的能与商业或付费应用媲美的应用。如果你是第一次使用 Linux 的 Windows 用户，你可能都没有听说过这些应用。

因此，在这一系列文章中，我们每一篇重点介绍一组 Ubuntu 应用，以增加 Linux 用户们的协作和认识。

这是 Ubuntu 应用程序系列的第二篇文章，如果你错过了其他部分，可以在这里阅读：


第一篇


1、OBS Studio

第一个应用是著名的 流媒体应用 —— OBS Studio 。这是一款自由开源的应用，主要用于互联网上的流媒体应用。此外，你可以使用该应用创建一个复杂的流媒体项目，包括多源、覆盖式横幅等功能。

而且，由于它能够支持“实时消息传输协议Real-Time Messaging Protocol”（RTMP），你可以使用它在 Facebook、Youtube、Twitch 以及其他支持的平台上进行流式传输。

这个有十年历史的应用程序是 Linux 上最好的应用程序之一。



你可以在 OBS Studio 官网 了解更多的信息并下载，或者通过以下方式安装。

通过 PPA 在 Ubuntu 和相关发行版上安装：

sudo add-apt-repository ppabsproject/obs-studio
sudo apt update
sudo apt install obs-studio


如果你希望通过 Flatpak 安装 ，首先 为 Flatpak 设置系统 然后 通过这个页面安装 。

在 Arch Linux 或者其他 Linux 版本，访问 此页面 了解。

2、Inkscape

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Little context: I was recently looking into a post saying that CutefishOS is basically dead (And by this point there isn't any doubt of that). Their email is not responding, their website no longer can be found, and any GitHub commits are basically pretty simple things. Apparently the reason is not enough funding.
 Under that post, I saw someone saying about reviving it again, and replied saying that if there are a few of us looking to do so I was ready to help. Long story short, about 10 people wanted to help me, so I've decided to overtake their distribution and recreate it from scratch using their desktop, apps etc.
 And this is where the first questions start:
  
1. What would you like to see from a distro like CutefishOS? Any recommendations, improvements? Don't be afraid to ask for some major changes.
 2. CutefishOS was using both Ubuntu and Debian as it's own base. I've also thought of Arch but I'm worried about stability and user friendliness, but it's not gone yet as an idea. Which one do you think would suit you better out of these three?
 3. Any particular things you don't like about CutefishOS? (Literally anything).
 4. Since this isn't really CutefishOS but rather a fork of it, I'd like to hear some name suggestions. Preferably not mentioning any other distro than CutefishOS.
  
I might create a GitHub repo to discuss everything there as devs, as soon as I'm sure there are people interested in the project.

Sybil，or the Two Nations, by Benjamin Disraeli, Wildside Press, March 2004, 412pp
1845年，英国小说家本杰明·迪斯雷利（1804-1881）“青年英格兰”三部曲的第二部《西比尔：或两个国度》（Sybil, or the Two Nations）问世，风靡一时。小说描绘了十九世纪中期英格兰社会的真实状况，被誉为维多利亚时代最负盛名的“政治小说”之一。巧合的是，恩格斯在同年出版的《英国工人阶级状况》一书中也认为随着贫富差距加大，英国事实上已分裂为“两个国度”——“工人比起资产阶级来，说的是另一种习惯语，有另一套思想和观念，另一套习俗和道德原则，另一种宗教和政治。这是两种完全不同的人，他们彼此是这样地不同，就好像他们是属于不同的种族一样”。恩格斯本人显然注意到了他和迪斯雷利的相似之处——他在1892年德文版中加入一则注解：“大家知道，狄思累利在他的长篇小说《神巫，或两种民族》中，几乎和我同时说出了大工业把英国人分为两种不同的民族的见解。”

维多利亚女王治下的大英帝国外表光鲜，有太平盛世之美誉。事实上，早在迪斯雷利开始小说创作之前，英国就享有“世界工厂”的称号：它的工业生产总值约占全球三分之一，钢铁和煤炭产量占世界半数；此外，英国商船纵横全球，繁盛的殖民地“贸易”将世界各地财富源源不断运回母国，伦敦由此也成为世界唯一的金融中心；它的国土面积超过三千三百万平方公里，是当之无愧的“日不落帝国”。毫无疑问，英国率先发动的工业革命为本国经济注入了巨大活力，从根本上改变了人们的生活方式，但与此同时，这一场变革也深刻改变了英国的社会结构：资本主义的生产方式扩大了贫富差距，使得英国社会最终沦为贫富之间存在不可逾越鸿沟的“两个…]]></summary>

《缘起香港：张爱玲的异乡和世界》，黄心村著，香港中文大学出版社，2022年7月出版，448页，28.00美元
张爱玲的故事说不完，不但她自己不断地叙述、重复和改写，而且崇拜她的“张迷”和研究“张学”的学者的著作更是越来越多，目不暇给。在我看过的众多张学著作中，黄心村的这本新作独树一格，令我眼睛一亮，从第一页开始读就放不下。虽然内中有两三章的前身在港台的刊物上发表过，如今重读依然引人入胜。另外几篇是第一次读，更令我惊喜。我不算是张迷，然而为什么黄心村的这本书竟然让我如此着迷？写这篇文章，却不知如何写起，只能把自己的一点阅读心得如实招来，和我自己对这位祖师奶奶的看法连在一起，作意识流式的叙述，随意发挥，断断续续，不成章法，尚望作者和读者原谅。 

一

本书作者黄心村是香港大学比较文学系的教授，也是一位成就卓越的中国现代文学学者，她研究张爱玲，可谓理所当然。书中前几章的珍贵资料，都是她在港大挖掘出来的，为了纪念张爱玲诞生一百周年展览之用，无心插柳，却硕果丰富。众所周知，张爱玲于1939至1941年间在港大读过书，在英国殖民主义的文化环境中接受教育并汲取文学创作的灵感，因此香港也是她创作灵感的源泉和起点。至今港大的图书馆还收藏了不少张爱玲的资料，为什么研究张爱玲和港大的关系的专著不多？张爱玲和香港的因缘就是由港大而起，她在港大虽然没有毕业，但是她的西方文学和历史的训练却是从港大开始的。本书的前三章都直接或间接与港大有关，讨论张爱玲在港大的生活和学习经验；后五章则把时空的幅度扩展到校园之外，讨论张爱玲一生和香港的缘分，为我们重绘了香港的文化图景。 
黄心村考据出张爱玲从前居住的港大女生宿舍，这是在成为女生宿舍之前的建筑样貌。摄于1930年代。亚历克·库珀（Alec Coope…]]></summary>

吉列尔莫·马丁内斯
吉列尔莫·马丁内斯是博尔赫斯之后第二个在《纽约客》上发表短篇小说的阿根廷人，这是书商对他的介绍。隐含的意思是，按照美国文学的某种标准，他和博尔赫斯一样值得注意。可是博尔赫斯之后有那么多非常好的阿根廷作家，比如科塔萨尔，就没有获得这种奥斯卡最佳外语片一样的殊荣。在今天的世界，马丁内斯是书写“知识”和因果性最具有娱乐性和最深刻的作家之一，但这句话就很难放在腰封上。

马丁内斯最好的作品《牛津迷案》受惠于博尔赫斯的一个短篇。作为小说家，受到博尔赫斯的影响不是什么令人羞耻的事情。正好相反，最好的学生都把博尔赫斯的名字写在小说里，翁贝托·艾柯《玫瑰之名》里的盲眼修士叫布尔戈索的豪尔赫，他还是图书馆长，这个名字一出现，有经验的读者就应该知道他绝对不是路人。《玫瑰之名》参考的除了《死亡与指南针》，还有《通天塔图书馆》。艾柯在为自己辩解的时候说，有些东西当然属于博尔赫斯，但是博尔赫斯也继承了别人，为什么你们不认为我有可能是继承了更早的、更本质的东西呢？他知道这样一来，这种学习行为即使在特别势利的读者眼里，也完全可以变得正当了。他还说，我这本书还学习了托马斯·曼的《浮士德博士》，为什么你们都看不出来呢。

除了作家，马丁内斯还有一重身份：布宜诺斯艾利斯大学的教授。这是一所很好的大学。通常没几个教授能写出被人记住的小说。有人先写出几本好书，再被随便哪个学校评为名誉教授，但这是犯规路径。戴维·洛奇曾经在伦敦大学教课，他有一些有趣的作品，是写他的文科同行。在《小世界》里，结构主义还是一种时髦到神秘的学问，而现在早已没有人愿意谈它了，读起来恍若隔世。库切是文学教授的骄傲，《耻》写的是教授的生活，并且他也得了诺贝尔奖。但是数学教授，他们在文学世界里像是不存在的生物，除了马丁内斯。他生于1962年，还没有退休。

一、楔子

再一次，我要对那些因为被标题误导而点击进来的读者说声抱歉：本文与小说无关，更与加西亚·马尔克斯无关。与之相关的是三年前在《上海书评》上发表的《教宗子午线谜案》，本文是该篇的补充。

有朋友在读完《教宗子午线谜案》后反馈说：我提出了很多问题，却没有解决问题。确实，当初写作的目的只是尝试指出现有的经济学制度分析方法之不足，至于是否可能存在更为合适的制度解释理路，文中只是给出了些许线索，并未做详细的探讨。

现在，我想通过分析其中一个典型案例——葡萄牙、西班牙与奥斯曼帝国在十六世纪的争霸与衰败，将《教宗子午线谜案》一文中提出的论题再往前推进一步，做一点衍生性思考。当然，这样的思考依旧不能解决现有理论存在的缺陷，甚至不可能让许多人（部分包括我自己在内）感到满意。但是至少我认为，对理解长时间段、大范围的社会制度变迁而言，探索一种相较于现有的经济学制度分析理论更为契合的解释框架，是可行的。

在开始之前，有必要指出：

第一，本文作为补篇，自然需要和前文保持一致，树立一个可供商榷的“靶子”。作为本文参照性评论的著作，我选取的是阿西莫格鲁（Daron Acemoglu）和罗宾逊（James A. Robinson）的《狭径》（The Narrow Corridor, 2019）。恰好，该书也是《教宗子午线谜案》一文中曾经评论过的《国家为什么会失败》（Why Nations Fail, 2012）一书的后续。

第二，作为一篇随笔性质的短文，论述当然无法达到学术论文那般的专业和严谨。本文所能做到的，是尽可能将观点及其论证过程用通俗的方式阐释清楚，但其中涉及的大量细节性材料和具体的理论，仍然不得不有所取舍。对那些追求完美的读者来说，参考与之相关的专业论文，查证一手资料和数据，是极其有必要的。

第三，无…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[前几天我试图安装 massCode 应用。对于安装，它提供了一个 Snap 文件以供下载。

当我尝试从 Snap 文件安装应用程序时：

sudo snap install snap_file


它给了我以下错误：

error: cannot find signatures with metadata for snap "masscode_2.6.1_amd64.snap"




这很奇怪。在 Ubuntu 中添加外部仓库 时，你必须添加 GPG 密钥。但是这里的开发人员没有提供这样的东西。

“修复”简单易行。让我给你解释一下。

处理 “cannot find signatures with metadata for snap” 错误

这里其实不涉及签名。

发生的情况是你从第三方下载了 Snap 安装程序。 Ubuntu 中的 Snap 机制希望你从官方 Snap 商店获取 Snap 包。

由于它不是来自 Snap 商店，因此你会看到 “cannot find signatures with metadata for snap” 的错误消息。与大多数错误消息一样，这个错误消息不是描述性的。

那么，这里的解决方案是什么？

任何未通过 Snap 商店分发的 Snap 包都必须使用 --dangerous 选项进行安装。这就是规则。

sudo snap install --dangerous path_to_snap_file


这样，你告诉 Snap 包管理器显式安装 Snap 包。

在这里，我使用了这个选项并且能够成功地从它的 Snap 包中安装 massCode。



以这种方式安装 Snap 包有多“危险”？几乎和下载并 安装 deb 格式安装包 相同。

在我看来，如果你是从项目开发者的网站上下载 Snap 包，你已经在信任该项目了。在这种情况下，你可以使用 --dangerous 选项安装它。

当然，你应该首先搜索该软件包是否在 Snap 商店中可用：

snap find package_name


我希望这个快速的小技巧可以帮助你修复 Snap 错误。如果你有任何问题或建议，请告诉我。如果你想了解更多信息，请参阅 这个使用 Snap 命令指南。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Howdy HN, just recently made this silly typewriter variant and think some of you might enjoy it so thought I'd share.
Here the cursor takes no heed of what you're typing and just advances at a steady pace, with the effect that typing something reasonable-looking requires you to type at a very steady rhythm. There's also the bonus that the space character is no longer needed—you can (and kind of have to) just wait—so the keyboard minimalists among us can shave even more space off their devices. Only desktop for now.
It's an interesting contrast to the last one I made—which requires you to do all the heavy lifting in moving the cursor position yourself—https://oisinmoran.com/typewriter

 Having something more carefully designed and intuitive (like gnome 40+, imo) is more beneficial. It's a hurdle to learn something from scratch but at least they have a way to mentally separate the UI from windows.
 Also I remember back in the days of being a teen a using ubuntu (gnome 2) and liking it specifically because it was different and with the cool transitions, effects, and so on.

There’s a lack of long term reviews, hardware compatibility reviews, and so on. The lack of long-term testing in particular is annoying; the warts usually come out then.
 Does anyone else agree?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[俄罗斯的 Debian 衍生发行版的开发商计划上市

来自俄罗斯的 Astra Linux 是 Debian 的下游发行版，它已经存在了一些年，除了 x86、Arm 等 CPU 架构外，它还支持 MIPS 架构。它是由 RusBITech 开发的，是专门为俄罗斯军队设计的。微软已经阻止了 Windows 在俄罗斯的使用，这似乎大大有助于推动替代操作系统的采用。路透社报道说，RosBITech 正计划在莫斯科证券交易所上市，估值约折合为 2.6 亿美元。

老王点评：我觉得他们比较谦虚，要是搞个根社区可能估值更高呢。




KDE Plasma 5.26 有望使用 C++20 进行开发

在即将到来的 KDE Plasma 5.26 桌面环境中，KDE 开发者正考虑使用 C++20 语言开发后续功能，尤其是使用 C++ 协同例程支持特性。随着时间的推移，这种较新的 C++ 语言也会用于其他 KDE 组件。将 C++ 要求提升到 C++20 意味着将 KDE 编译器要求提高到 GCC 10 或 Clang 11，而这些版本的编译器已经稳定发布两年了。


消息来源：Phoronix



老王点评：看来最近各个开源项目都在逐渐迁移到新的语言标准和新的编译器了，这种稳健而进步的态度是开源的生命力。




RISC-V 仅用 12 年达成百亿核心里程碑

在近日召开的 Embedded World 大会上，RISC-V 国际的 CEO 宣布目前 RISC-V 市场上的核心数量已经突破 100 亿。CEO 认为开放标准是关键，“Linux 在为软件所做的事情，和我们为硬件所做的事情有异曲同工之妙。”RISC-V 是一种开放标准指令集架构（ISA），根据开源许可提供。据悉，ARM 架构经过 17 年，在 2008 年实现了这个里程碑。而 RISC-V 只用了 12 年就完成了这一目标。

 I have been using nvidia-open for a while, and I am really surprised how well it works. I was expecting it to have issues, but for my 3080 it seems to be running a few games even better. Close to the sun was rather stuttery initially, but after switching to open module, it's been running super well.
 I haven't tested wayland but some hyprland users seem to say it is working with nvidia-open.
 What has your experience been? Are you using it? Any improvements you noticed?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[学习如何用动态链接库将多个 C 目标文件结合到一个单个的可执行文件之中。




当使用 C 编程语言编写一个应用程序时，你的代码通常有多个源文件代码。

最终，这些文件必须被编译到一个单个的可执行文件之中。你可以通过创建静态或动态库（后者也被称为 共享shared 库）来实现这一点。这两种类型的库在创建和链接的方式上有所不同。两者都有缺点和优点，这取决于你的使用情况。

动态链接是最常见的方法，尤其是在 Linux 系统上。动态链接会保持库模块化，因此，很多应用程序可以共享一个库。应用程序的模块化也允许单独更新其依赖的共享库。

在这篇文章中，我将演示动态链接是如何工作的。在后期的文章中，我将演示静态链接。

链接器

链接器linker是一个命令，它将一个程序的数个部分结合在一起，并为它们重新组织内存分配。

链接器的功能包括：


整合一个程序的所有的部分

计算出一个新的内存组织结构，以便所有的部分组合在一起

恢复内存地址，以便程序可以在新的内存组织结构下运行

解析符号引用


链接器通过这些功能，创建了一个名为可执行文件executable的可以运行的程序。在你创建一个动态链接的可执行文件前，你需要一些用来链接的库，和一个用来编译的应用程序。准备好你 最喜欢的文本编辑器 并继续。

创建目标文件

首先，创建带有这些函数签名的头文件 mymath.h ：

int add(int a, int b);
int sub(int a, int b);
int mult(int a, int b);
int divi(int a, int b);


使用这些函数定义来创建 add.c 、sub.c 、mult.c 和 divi.c 文件。我将把所有的代码都放置到一个代码块中，请将其分为四个文件，如注释所示：

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Meta 的 “不落下任何语言No Language Left Behind” 是一个宏大的开源项目，旨在以最高准确度翻译语言。




Meta（前身是 Facebook）在开源世界做出了不小的贡献。Meta 除了专注于元宇宙Metaverse和其社交媒体平台外，还致力于各种研究和创新工作，比如 React（一个 JaveScript 库）。

现在，Meta 的研究人员决定开源一个叫 “不落下任何语言No Language Left Behind” 项目。

（LCTT 校注：这个直译项目名称不够好听，我来抛砖引玉，似可称做“无人独语”，读者有什么建议吗？）

Meta 试图不落下任何语言




目前，虽然世界上有大约 7000 个在使用中的语言，但大多数在线的内容都是以少数的流行语言来提供的，比如英语。这让许多不懂这些语言的人处于不利的地位。

虽然现存的许多翻译工具，但语法错误会让错误变得难以阅读和理解。另外，如果你想把内容翻译为一个不流行的语言（特别是非洲和亚洲的一些语言），翻译体验不会很好。

因此，Meta 正在开发有最高质量的翻译工具，可以帮助解决这一全球性的问题。

NLLB-200（不落下任何语言No Language Left Behind） 是一个人工智能翻译模型，其可以翻译 200 多种语言。该模型在每种语言中的翻译结果是通过一个名为 FLORES-200 复杂数据集来确定和评估的。

正如 Meta 所说，NLLB 的翻译结果比以前的人工智能研究方法好 40% 。对于一些最不常见的语言，其翻译准确率甚至超过 70%。了不起的工作！

为了帮助开发项目和提高模型的翻译质量，Meta 向所有感兴趣的研究人员开放了源代码，包括 NLLB-200 模型、FLORES-200 数据库、模型训练和重建训练数据库的代码。

你可以在 GitHub 上找到源代码，并且可以在该项目的 博客 上了解它的更多信息。

对社会事业的鼓励

Meta 宣布向从事联合国可持续发展目标UN Sustainable Development Goals任何领域工作和翻译非洲语言的非营利组织和研究人员提供高达 20 万美元的捐赠，也鼓励其他学术领域如语言学和机器翻译的研究人员申请。

项目的影响

尽管 Meta 主要打算在其数字平台上，特别是在“元宇宙”上使用 NLLB，但 NLLB 也有可能在其他领域产生巨大影响。

许多用户可以用他们的母语轻松地访问和阅读在线资源。项目开源后，社区应该能够帮助实现这个目标。

你对 Meta 的这个项目有什么看法？

 来源：澎湃新闻
                

高名潞（章静绘）
创刊于1976年的《十月》（OCTOBER）杂志在北美乃至全球当代艺术系统中扮演着重要的角色，其分析模式和理论风格一度被视为形式主义之后艺术评论的典范。近半个世纪来，围绕“历史唯物主义”“精神分析”“机构批判”“身体政治”“景观”“女性主义”“全球化”“文化战争”“后殖民”“纪念碑”等前沿话题，《十月》展开了一系列批评和写作的激进实验，在艺术系统内外造成了广泛而深远的影响。因此，与其说它是一份专业的当代艺术学术刊物，不如说是一个艺术认知变革的策动者。然而新世纪以来，随着艺术日新月异的变化，《十月》也日渐显现出其保守的一面。特别是互联网时代的来临，使得理论、批评以及艺术媒体皆面临着种种新的危机和挑战。

值此第八届国际艺术评论奖（IAAC 8）启动之际，复旦大学哲学学院与上海民生现代美术馆联合举办了“‘《十月》学派’与当代艺术评论”主题论坛，通过重估《十月》及其理论遗产和当代意义，希望重新唤起一种更具思辨性和批判力的艺术评论与艺术写作。在论坛举办之前，复旦大学哲学学院鲁明军代表《上海书评》采访了美国匹兹堡大学艺术史系高名潞教授。

高名潞教授是'85新潮美术运动重要的参与者和推动者，是1980年代末“中国现代艺术大展”重要的策划者和组织者之一。他在上世纪九十年代初赴美留学，在哈佛大学攻读艺术史博士学位。在此期间，他不仅系统学习了欧美现代艺术理论，还持续参与中美当代艺术的对话实践。他策划了由美国亚洲协会和旧金山美术馆主办、在亚洲协会和PS1当代艺术中心同时展出的“蜕变突破：华人新艺术”（Inside Out：New Chinese Art）大展，并以中国及亚洲部分策展人的身份参与策划了“1950至1980年代的全球观念艺术展”和“五大洲与一个城市”等重要展览。同时，他也是中国最具理…]]></summary>

 I just want to make a couple things clear:
  
I'm obviously not very knowledgeable about linux to be asking this
 
I have no desire to perform this insane task outside of attempting it for shots and goggles, it's purely a theoretical question.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm based in Vancouver, work remotely for a global company, and the outage yesterday was a huge pain in the butt for myself and many Canadians I work with... I am appalled that 911 services weren't even working in some cases.
The telcos here are terrible. I'd love to hear how HN users would think of bootstrapping a telco?
We've had a few startups try and disrupt things in Canada (e.g., Wind Mobile). They were funded by large global investment groups and eventually simply got acquired by the incumbent telcos.
The other approach I've seen is piggybacking on existing telco infrastructure. This is required by law since the Canadian government subsidizes telco infrastructure... It's not uncommon for the telcos to renege on their contractual/legal obligations. Plus, this doesn't create any redundant networks.
So: how else can one launch a telco? What creative solutions have folks seen?
I'm thinking: VOIP-only service that has direct access to the Internet backbone in Toronto, Vancouver, etc. so you can at least have completely separate service in major cities... Or crowdfunding 5G towers (though I imagine spectrum licensing is an issue here).
Would love to hear what other HN readers think.

Pluton 是微软公司于 2020 年首次推出的 Windows PC 安全协处理器。与 TPM 一道，其旨在增强 Windows 操作系统的安全性。联想发布的新款 ThinkPad Z13 和 Z16 笔记本电脑就支持 Pluton。然而，有 Linux 专家发现，无法在 ThinkPad Z13 笔记本电脑上，通过 USB 来启动 Linux。这是因为 Pluton 默认只接受 Windows 引导加载和配套驱动程序，使用第三方 UEFI 证书的 Linux 发行版会被阻止启动。联想证实，从 2022 年起，该公司开始遵循微软给出的 PC 安全启动建议，并于默认情况下禁用第三方证书。

Ubuntu 将 Firefox Snap 启动速度提升了一倍

Canonical 在一篇博文中披露，“与 Firefox 101 相比，全新安装版本的启动时间平均减少了 50%。”这是由于 Firefox 改成了在启动时一次只复制一个环境 / 语言包（而不是所有语言包），区域设置将遵循系统设置，因而大幅缩减了启动等待时间。以及将 Firefox 及其 GNOME 和 GTK 主题的 Snap 软件包从 XZ 切换到 LZO，加快了解压/启动速度。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[NTFS 是 Windows NT 系列操作系统支持的磁盘文件系统格式，它是一个特别为网络和磁盘配额、文件加密等管理安全特性设计的文件系统。而 Linux 内核中新进入主线支持的 NTFS3 驱动是一个功能齐全的 NTFS 驱动程序，该驱动程序适用于最高的 NTFS 3.1 版本。


简介

最初，Linux 内核没有 NTFS 的原生支持，后来对 NTFS 的支持也仅提供了只读功能。来自 Tuxera 的 NTFS-3G 是之前主流的解决方案，但在实际使用中也存在一些问题。NTFS-3G 是借助 Linux 的用户空间文件系统（FUSE）模块在用户层实现的一个对 NTFS 支持的文件系统，其对 NTFS 的访问逻辑代码都是在用户层代码实现的。

在 NTFS3 出现之前，Linux 上使用 NTFS 主要问题还是缺乏稳定且功能齐全的读/写支持。

2020 年，Paragon 软件公司做出了一个惊人的决定：尝试将之前只提供给商业客户的 NTFS3 驱动程序贡献到 Linux 主线。最终，在经过多轮审核和修改之后，Linux 内核 5.15 合并了 Paragon 提供的 NTFS3 内核驱动，它拥有更高的性能和更多的特性。


该驱动程序实现了对 NTFS 文件系统中的正常、稀疏和压缩文件的读/写支持。

支持本地日志回放。

支持已挂载的 NTFS 卷的 NFS 导出。

支持文件和文件夹的权限管理。




如何使用 NTFS3 驱动挂载 NTFS 卷

使用 NTFS3 驱动挂载时使用的文件系统类型是 ntfs3。

手动挂载

以前使用 NTFS-3g 驱动的挂载方式是：

# mount -t ntfs-3g /dev/sdxY /mnt


现在只需要将 ntfs-3g 替换为 ntfs3 即可：

# mount -…]]></summary>

《浮动的海岸：一部白令海峡的环境史》，[美]芭丝谢芭·德穆思著，刘晓卉译，译林出版社2022年5月出版，398页，88.00元
在我的想象中，环境史有两类，作为查漏补缺的、狭义的环境史和按照历史新思维构建的、广义的环境史。自环境史研究诞生以来，前者比比皆是，后者尚付阙如，以至于无论是教学还是指导博士生研究环境史，我都很难给学生提供一个学习和模仿广义环境史的范本。《浮动的海岸：一部白令海峡环境史》的出版解决了这一难题，它既能满足学生的需求，又为推进广义环境史研究提供了良好的新起点。

历史的本质：超越人类中心主义

该书的问题意识是：当自然或环境进入历史时，历史的本质是什么？具体而言，就是在自然塑造了人的前提下，人又如何被这个世界重塑？显然，这是要在环境整体中探讨人与环境的相互作用的历史。这个问题意识的产生既源于作者自十八岁以来多次在白令吉亚生活、工作和研究的现场体验，也源于对传统历史学的反思。在独特的北极环境中，作者体会到了自然的伟岸，在与当地人一起工作和生活中，作者受到了当地人关于环境的知识的影响。这些都让作者不得不放下来自工业社会的惯习，转而从整体认识人在环境中的位置和作用。也正是在这样的环境中，自柯林伍德以来把环境剔除出历史编撰的传统史学思维变得不合时宜，建构一种新型历史成为作者要完成的任务。

全书按空间分为五个部分，依次从海洋越过海岸到陆地，从地表到地下，最后重新回到海洋。从空间上把海陆连为白令吉亚，从时间上涵盖了从十九世纪中期到现在的全过程。正是在这样的“时间地图”环境中，当地人（因纽皮亚特人、尤皮克人、楚克奇人）、美国人、苏联人和鲸鱼、海象、狐狸以及黄金和锡矿等上演了复杂精彩的，融环境、经济、社会和文化于一体的多幕生态戏剧。十九世纪后半期（1848-1900），美国捕鲸者闯入北太…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Tig 是审查 Git 仓库的绝佳工具，它鼓励你探索日志，而无需构建冗长且有时复杂的查询。


如果你发现浏览你的 Git 仓库非常复杂，我已经为你准备好了工具，来了解一下 Tig。

Tig 是一个 基于 ncurses 的 Git 文本模式界面，它允许你浏览 Git 仓库中的更改。它还可以充当各种 Git 命令输出的分页器。使用这个工具可以让我很好地了解在哪个提交中发生了哪些更改，最新的提交合并是什么等等。请跟随这个简短的教程，亲自尝试一下。

安装 Tig

在 Linux 上，你可以使用包管理器安装 Tig。例如，在 Fedora 和 Mageia 上：

$ sudo dnf install tig


在 Debian、Linux Mint、Elementary、Pop_OS 和其他基于 Debian 的发行版上：

$ sud apt install tig


在 macOS 上，使用 MacPorts 或 Homebrew。 Tig 的完整安装指南可在 Tig 手册 中找到。

使用 Tig

Tig 提供了常见 Git 输出的交互式视图。例如，使用 Git，你可以使用命令 git show-ref 查看所有引用：

$ git show-ref
98b108... refs/heads/master
6dae95... refs/remotes/origin/1010-internal-share-partition-format-reflexion
84e1f8... refs/remotes/origin/1015-add-libretro-openlara
e62c7c... refs/remotes/origin/1016-add-support-for-retroarch-project-cd
1c29a8... refs/remotes/origin/1066-add-libretro-mess
ffd3f53... refs/remotes/origin/1155-automatically-generate-assets-for-external-installers
ab4d14... refs/remotes/origin/1160-release-on-bare-metal-servers
28baa9... refs/remotes/origin/1180-ipega-pg-9118
8dff1d... refs/remotes/origin/1181-add-libretro-dosbox-core-s
81a7fe... refs/remotes/origin/1189-allow-manual-build-on-master
[...]


使用 Tig，你可以在可滚动列表中获取该信息以及更多信息，此外还可以使用键盘快捷键来打开其他视图，其中包含每个引用的详细信息。



分页模式

当输入来自标准输入时，Tig 进入分页模式。当指定 show 子命令并给出 --stdin 选项时，标准输入被假定为提交 ID 列表，它被转发到 git-show ：

$ git rev-list --author=sumantrom HEAD | tig show –stdin


日志和差异视图

当你在 Tig 的日志视图中时，你可以按键盘上的 d 键来显示差异。这将显示提交中更改的文件以及删除和添加的行。

交互式 Git 数据

Tig 是对 Git 的一个很好的补充。它鼓励你探索日志，而无需构建冗长且有时复杂的查询，从而可以轻松查看你的 Git 仓库。

立即将 Tig 添加到你的 Git 工具包中！

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[当地时间7月8日，特斯拉公司首席执行官埃隆·马斯克表示，将终止对推特的收购，理由是推特严重违反了协议中的多项条款，包括虚假账户的问题。
　　马斯克在给推特首席法律顾问的信中表示，因为推特不愿意分享马斯克要求的信息，所以终止收购，且现有信息证明了，目前推特的虚假账户数量远超过公司对外声明的数量。马斯克认为，推特做出了虚假和误导性陈述。
　　马斯克此番表态公布没多久，推特方面随即回击表示，要将马斯克告上法庭。
　　Twitter董事长Bret Taylor表示，董事会致力于按照与马斯克约定的条款完成交易，并计划采取法律行动执行合并协议，推特有信心在在特拉华州衡平法院胜诉。
　　马斯克一直要求推特方面公布虚假账户数量，早在5月17日，马斯克就表示，在推特CEO公开证明推特上虚假账户少于5%之前，他不会继续收购推特的交易。根据推特的业绩报告，推特的虚假账户占用户总数的不到5％。
　　4月14日，马斯克向推特发出440亿美元收购邀约，仅10天后，推特官宣接受马斯克对其私有化。4月25日，推特宣布同意马斯克的收购协议，后者将以每股54.2美元，总计约440亿美元的价格收购推特。收购消息公布后，推特股价一度涨至54.57美元。
　　正当外界已经开始探讨马斯克将如何改造推特时，不确定性却纷至沓来。期间，马斯克多次针对推特发布负面言论，从商业模式到审核政策都数落了一遍。后因质疑推特自行披露的虚假账户占比，马斯克搁置了该交易。经过长达数周的僵局，6月8日，推特终向马斯克妥协，表示将提供全部推特用户发布推文的数据流。
　　值得注意的是，随着推特股价接连走低，与马斯克此前给出的每股54.2美元的现金收购价价差正在继续扩大。股价反映出市场对这项交易顺利完成的没有很大信心，有不少市场人士猜测马斯克很可能会放弃这笔440亿美元的收购计划。
　　《纽约时报》此前就表示，马斯克一直在试图退出交易或重新谈判以获取更低的价格，美股科技公司的股票一直受挫，包括马斯克主要财富来源特斯拉。从4月25日宣布交易以来，推特股价下跌接近30%，特斯拉股价下跌接近25%。
　　当地时间6月16日上午，马斯克以视频形式和8000多名推特员工进行了长达一个多小时的问答。这是他表态要收购推特后首次与员工交流。《纽约时报》写道，马斯克本次参会，意味着他正准备完成这笔重磅收购。在交流会上，对于能否完成收购交易这个市场最为关注的问题，马斯克并未提及。且据彭博社报道，在场并没有人向马斯克问及这一问题。
　　截至7月8日美股收盘，推特收跌4.85%，报收36.91美元，盘后一度跌逾12%。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi. I am trying to make a Firefox-Based Operating System from Linux. Why, you may ask?
 I've played around with Firefox. And it seems like It's got some basic necessities
 For example:
 File Manager
 ​
 (Startpage.com) Calculator
 Although, I could try and make another one
 ​
 (clocktab.com) (Customized) Clock App
 Like the Calculator, I could also try and make another Clock App
 ​
 Fully Functioning Image Viewer
 There's Also a Video Player, But It's not the smoothest
 ​
 (idenati.com) Website Manager (Had to use a different browser because Firefox didn't let me log in)
 And much more
 ​
 But, most of the apps I've shown aren't open-source.
 ​
 So, would It be possible to:
 - Make multiple open-source Web Apps
 - Create a whole Operating System from a browser (E.g. ChromeOS)
 ​
 If possible, I would make this a thing. But, I would need some help

 Physically the unit is a little larger than anticipated. This is good, as the screen is also bigger. Though not *big*, but bigger than a Switch. 
 I got the mid-range Steam Deck with 256G storage. I'm not much of a gamer but played a few games including Dying Light, Road96 and a couple others. They played fine and I didn't notice any weirdness or incompatibilities. It is easy enough to use that were I to buy any other games, it would be my first choice versus one of the laptops. Performance is better than my Android tablets.
 The Desktop mode was interesting. It looks just like a desktop and when attached to a monitor and keyboard, is perfectly serviceable as a minimal desktop. At work, a good 80% of my time is in a tmux terminal, 10% in a browser, and 10% in VSCode. The trackpad was serviceable as a mouse, but definitely worth connecting a proper mouse (bluetooth is supported). No issues with my keyboards (both US and German). Bluetooth seems solid and not laggy.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I made "I Spy Notify", which lets you watch Linux desktop notifications and run scripts for each notification. It's great for (but not limited to!) logging, displaying popups, and playing sounds.
 You can visit the GitHub repository here: https://github.com/haritkapadia/i-spy-notify.
 The project comes with an XDG Desktop file and a System-D service file. The configuration file is ~/.config/i-spy-notify.json. Example configurations are in the doc/examples folder. The project is written in C.
 Here's some fun things I learned about Linux notifications while working on I Spy Notify.
  
There are many ways to send image data over a notification. You can: 
 Send a key word that is associated with an icon (for example, "camera-photo" represents an image of a camera in your current icon theme).
 Send a path to the image.
 Send the image as a byte stream (the format is basically an array of pixels, and is very similar to the GdkPixbuf struct).
 
 Notifications can be replaced by other notifications, if the application requests it.
 When an application sends a notification, it may first query the notification daemon for the server's capabilities, which explain what features of the standard that the daemon supports.
 dbus-monitor monitors a bus by sending a message to the bus that requests that the connection established by dbus-monitor becomes a monitor connection. If there is already a notification daemon running (which there usually is), I create a monitor connection in the same way.

the way that they package software has been relatively static.  While the
.deb and RPM formats (and others) have evolved with time, their current
form would not be unrecognizable to their creators.  Distributors are
pushing for change, though.  Both the Fedora and openSUSE projects are
moving to reduce the role of the venerable RPM format and switch to Flatpak for much of their software
distribution; some users are proving hard to convince that this is a good

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[7月7日，据北京法院审判信息网显示，刘翔与北京新东方前途出国咨询有限公司（下称新东方前途出国）网络侵权纠纷一审、二审判决书公开。
　　刘翔起诉称，2016年8月9日，新东方前途出国未经允许，在微信公众号“新东方美国中学留学”发布《从8年前的刘翔到今年的傅园慧，中国这才真正强大起来》一文，使用数幅刘翔肖像照片，文章末尾附有“美国小常青藤中学全国巡展”的广告宣传及商业宣传信息，构成对刘翔肖像权的侵害。
　　刘翔向法院提出诉讼，要求被告在全国公开发行的报纸及其官方微信公众号上连续六十日赔礼道歉，并赔偿经济损失及精神损害抚慰金15万元、维权合理开支5000元。
　　新东方前途出国辩称，在获知被控侵权事实后立即对前述文章进行了删除处理，主观上并无侵权故意，且客观上亦未给刘翔造成损失，刘翔主张的赔偿金额过高。
　　经法院认定，微信公众号后台信息截图显示，前述文章已删除，且删除时阅读量为676。
　　一审认为，新东方前途出国构成对刘翔肖像权的侵害，涉案文章虽使用刘翔肖像，但相关图片均系刘翔赛场照片，并未对刘翔肖像进行丑化、污损，侵权行为轻微，判令书面致歉。酌情确定刘翔经济损失数额为6000元。
　　7月7日，北京云亭律师事务所合伙人位艳玲向界面教育表示，此类肖像权案，如果被告使用肖像照片进行商业性使用，会根据该人物的知名度、影响范围以及被告有无获利等因素进行综合考虑后判决。
　　“判赔6000元主要基于它的使用形式，（该肖像照）是在文章中使用，和单独拿刘翔的照片贴在某个特别显眼的地方，比如广告牌、网站首页等单独显示的场景，情节是不一样的。法院会考虑很多情节。”位艳玲告诉界面教育。
　　刘翔并非首位因公众号文章使用其照片而起诉的明星。2020年，一自媒体博主因未经许可使用艺人鞠婧祎的肖像，而被告上法庭。一审法院判决驳回了鞠婧祎的全部诉讼请求，认为该微信公众号发布涉案文章并非以营利为目的，也非利用鞠婧祎的商业价值进行引流、提高销量，因此不存在过错，不应当承担侵权责任。
　　鞠婧祎不服一审判决，向上海一中院提起上诉。二审再次败诉。鞠婧祎肖像权案的判决书写道：“原告作为演艺圈公众人物，对社会公众就其公开发布的照片进行评价理应负有一定的容忍义务。”
　　在明星肖像权案中，更美、新氧等医美平台公众号发布的推文由于经常涉及对明星整容的猜测和判断，遭到不少明星起诉。
　　天眼查App显示，知名医美平台“更美App”的运营主体北京完美创意科技有限公司（下称北京完美公司），自2019年至今，共发生24件肖像权纠纷，涉及靳东、赵丽颖、唐嫣、胡杏儿等多位艺人。
　　在和明星肖像权诉争中，北京完美公司多次被判败诉、赔偿。例如，2020年，其被判赔偿刘诗施经济损失13万元，并在公众号连续10日刊登致歉声明；被判赔偿吴静怡合计超20万元等。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[由于上游的一些改进，Fedora Linux 37 将引入对树莓派 4 的正式支持。




Fedora Linux 的工作站版很适合台式机使用。不过，如果你想让它用于服务器或物联网需求，可以使用 Fedora ARM 项目。

它也支持树莓派，只是最新的树莓派 4 除外（其实早在 2019 年就发布了）。

现在，随着 Phoronix 发现的一项拟议的变化，看起来 Fedora Linux 37 可能会正式增加对树莓派 4 的支持。

目前还不是正式的...

到现在为止，对树莓派 4 的支持只是一个拟议的变化。

Fedora Linux 通常会公开其拟议的变化列表，以接受社区反馈并让其他人跟踪其进展。

所以，Fedora Linux 37 中的正式支持只有在得到 Fedora 工程指导委员会的批准后才会实施。

但是，支持树莓派 4 的阻碍是什么呢？

这是由于缺乏加速图形以及缺失一些功能，所以不方便增加对它的支持。

现在，随着新的 Linux 内核和 Mesa 的上游工作为树莓派 4 带来了图形加速功能，可以让他们启用对它的支持。

拟议的变化文件中提到：


上游现在支持使用 V3D GPU 的 OpenGL-ES 和 Vulkan 加速图形。对有线网络也有增强，支持 CM4/4B 上的 PTPv2。


此外，不仅仅是引入对树莓派 4 的支持，一些拟议的变化还涉及对树莓派 3 系列和 Zero 2 W 的改进。

因此，如果如人们所期望的那样发生，这应该是一个有趣的变化。

请注意，对树莓派 400 的 Wi-Fi 的支持不是这个过程的一部分，但对音频支持的测试将是这个变化的一部分。

你可以在 拟议文件 中阅读所有的细节。

你对 Fedora Linux 37 对树莓派 4 的支持有什么看法？请在下面的评论中分享你的想法。

 Lenovo shipping new laptops that only boot Windows by default
 It seems to be specific to the new Z13 Lenovo series, from what I get, if you plug a Knoppix, Ubuntu or Tails USB stick in them out of the box you are out of luck because they won't boot and you need to tinker with the firmware first (assuming you can do that).
 What do you think? Is it just a rant about Lenovo's default option in the firmware that can be changed easily, or step by step, Microsoft's idea of Palladium has finally arrived to chain us all into Windows with all major manufacturers following this trend? Thanks in advance for your insight.

由于担心美国的监控行为，欧洲法院于 2020 年废除了一项名为“隐私保护”的欧盟-美国数据流动协议。在其裁决中，它还使美国公司用来向美国转移个人数据的另一个法律工具，即标准合同条款（SCC）更难使用。爱尔兰数据保护委员会周四通知其同行，它将阻止 Facebook 将用户数据从欧洲发送到美国。这一草拟的决定意味着 Facebook 也被迫停止依赖 SCC。Meta 公司曾多次警告说，这样的决定将使其在欧洲的包括 Facebook 和 Instagram 在内的许多服务关闭。

Chrome 优化后台页面处理策略，提升笔记本电池时间

Chrome 是耗能大户，因此在笔记本电脑上非常影响电池使用时间。Chrome 在最新的版本中增加了一个新的“快速强化节流”策略。该功能可以在 10 秒后停止后台页面加载 JavaScript 元素，而之前的限制是 5 分钟，并且它将限制唤醒定时任务，最多每分钟 1 次。谷歌称，这有望延长电池使用时长，当所有标签都被隐藏和静止时，CPU 占用有 10% 的改善。该功能过段时间才会进入稳定通道。


消息来源：Tech Radar



老王点评：感觉浏览器技术和 Web 技术无止境啊，Chrome 能占有这么大的市场，可见并非侥幸。




推特每天删除上百万个垃圾账户

之前，马斯克威胁要停止 440 亿美元的收购推特的交易，除非该公司拿出证据，证明垃圾机器人账户占看到广告的用户中不到 5%。推特在周四的一次简报会中说，推特每天删除超过 100 万个垃圾账户。该公司重申，人工审查人员随机检查了数千个账户，并使用公共和私人数据的组合，以计算该比例，在接受广告服务的用户中，垃圾账户远低于 5%。


消息来源：路透社



老王点评：虽然我认为马斯克在玩弄花招，但是要说推特只有 5% 的垃圾机器人账号，我是不信的。]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[这篇面向初学者的文章探讨了在 Linux 中如何在普通视图中隐藏文件和文件夹。图形用户界面和命令行方法都有所涉猎。




有时你需要在 Linux 中隐藏文件。

不要误会，我不是指那些你不想让你的家人看到的“特殊文件”。尽管你可以隐藏这些特殊文件，但更好的办法还是用密码锁定它们以提供额外的保护。

回到隐藏文件的话题。名称以 . 开头的任何文件或文件夹在 Linux 中是“隐藏的”。

Linux 有很多这样的文件和文件夹，在普通视图中它们是隐藏的。这些主要是系统和程序所需的配置文件。

用户通常不需要理会它们，因此它们在普通视图中是隐藏的，这样一来你就不会被许多看起来很奇怪的而不是你所创建的文件所淹没。

下图展示了我的主目录中隐藏的文件和文件夹。





如果你使用的是桌面版 Linux，你可以通过在文件管理器中按 Ctrl+H 快捷键来轻松 查看隐藏文件。在终端中，你可以使用 ls -a 命令显示隐藏文件和普通文件。

那么，如何在 Linux 中创建隐藏文件呢？你只需用一个在命名的时候加一个 . 前缀。就是这样。

在桌面版 Linux 里创建隐藏文件和文件夹（GUI 方法）

如果你使用的是文件管理器，在文件或文件夹上右键并选择重命名选项。现在你所要做的就是在文件名的开头添加一个 .。

当你以这种方式创建隐藏文件时，GNOME 的 Nautilus 文件管理器也会显示一个警告。



你可以以相同的方式隐藏文件夹及其所有内容。

你可以按 Ctrl+H 键来显示隐藏文件。哦！我是多么的喜欢 Ubuntu 中的键盘快捷键 和我使用的任何其他程序或操作系统！

要使隐藏文件变回普通文件，只需再次重命名这些文件删掉文件名前缀的 . 即可。

在 Linux 终端创建隐藏文件和文件夹（CLI 方法）

如果你热衷于终端，你…]]></summary>

 来源：澎湃新闻
                

《作茧自缚：人类早期国家的深层历史》，[美]詹姆斯·C. 斯科特著，田雷译，中国政法大学出版社，2022年5月出版，362页，79.00元
对于中文读者来说，耶鲁大学教授詹姆斯·斯科特（James Scott）并不是一个陌生的名字。他的著作《农民的道义经济学》（The Moral Economy of the Peasant, 1976）、《弱者的武器》（Weapons of the Weak, 1987）、《国家的视角》（Seeing Like a State, 1999）以及《逃避统治的艺术》（The Art of Not Being Governed, 2010）早已成为社会学、人类学、政治学乃至法学研究中的重要作品。他对现代国家微观政治权力运作逻辑的剖析，不仅常常揭示出有意无意间被层层历史叙事掩盖的真相，还往往在字里行间让我们领会到支配现代社会生活的诸般符咒的荒诞与孱弱。他在八十一岁高龄时推出的Against the Grain: A Deep History of the Earliest States（Yale University Press, 2017）则将目光延伸向了远方，试图挖掘人类早期国家形成这一宏大历史叙事背后的潜隐剧本。

本书主标题“Against the Grain”是斯科特有意为之的双关。这个词在英语中意指事与愿违，它含蓄地提醒读者本书将采用社会科学领域常见的叙事策略，即关注人类有意为之的活动所带来的不期而至或出乎意料的结果。同时，本书的核心内容是谷物的种植与税收促使人类早期国家形成，但社会分化与奴役等种种不幸也随之而来，因此这个标题又包含着斯科特本人的立场与倾向。本书的繁体中文版将这个题目直译为“反谷”，似有谐音“反骨”之意（翁德明译，麦田出版社，2019年）；田雷…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[大流行加快了印度全国数字化转型的速度，这需要对数据中心进行更多投资。由于快速的数字化和云采用，印度数据中心市场的容量预计在未来几年将翻一番。据报道，2021 年印度数据中心市场规模为 43.5 亿美元，到 2027 年将达到 100.9 亿美元，2022-2027 年的复合年增长率为 15.07%。

现在，出现的一个关键问题是印度数据中心行业的未来是什么？哪些新趋势将塑造其未来？下面提到的是将对印度数据中心行业产生重大影响的主要趋势。

数据本地化

数据本地化就意味着限制数据从一个国家流向另一个国家。印度政府已发布指导方针，强调需要在该国境内存储印度用户的数据。数据本地化使得收集关键消费者数据的公司必须在本地数据中心存储和处理这些数据。这给本地数据中心带来了巨大的增长。此外，印度的成本优势和熟练劳动力的便利性使其成为亚洲数据中心的重要枢纽。

可持续数据中心

众所周知，数据中心消耗大量非可再生资源。为了使数据中心可持续发展，公司重新设计了他们的设施，通过利用人工智能、机器学习和云等新兴技术来大大降低电力和水的消耗。云数据中心使用更少的服务器，从而减少碳排放。它们通常位于更靠近为其供电的设施，以防止在长距离传输电能的过程中出现大量损失。此外，公共云数据中心可用于存储来自多个业务的数据。本地数据中心在存储大量数据时存在容量限制，从而导致资源的非最佳使用。因此，云数据中心通过使企业能够消耗更少的服务器和更少的电力并减少其在此过程中的碳排放，正在彻底改变行业。

边缘连接

边缘数据中心是靠近网络边缘的小型数据中心。它们通常连接到更大的中央数据中心或多个数据中心。通过处理更接近最终用户的数据和服务，边缘计算允许组织减少延迟并改善客户体验。这样的数据中心对于需要实时数据处理的行业非常有利，例如自动驾驶汽车、远程医疗、电信、OTT 平台和智能可穿戴设备。

超大规模数据中心

传统上，数据中心是一个简单的机架网络，带有存储单元和一组管理工具。它具有易于理解的架构。然而，随着数字化转型接管了企业界，组织开始生成大量数据。传统的存储单元和工具不足以处理大量涌入的数据，因此需要更大的容量和复杂的设施。此外，传统数据中心无法扩大或缩小其能力以适应需求波动，从而导致资源浪费。这导致了超大规模作为解决方案的演变。

超大规模数据中心是大规模的关键业务设施，旨在通过将大量高速协同工作的服务器聚集在一起，有效地支持强大且可扩展的应用。这种能力使数据中心能够水平和垂直扩展。

总之，数据中心行业正在发展，新趋势将不断涌现。借助新时代的颠覆性技术，数据中心行业可以构建环保节能的数据中心。人工智能、边缘计算和物联网等技术可用于最大限度地提高能源效率并最大限度地减少对环境的影响。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[看来微软拿了一手好牌，在 Linux 和开源方面取得行业成功。




出于某种原因，微软在开源和 Linux 方面总是受到关注。

而且，当我们谈论 Linux 开发者时，它也会成为焦点……为什么会这样？

微软似乎正在为一系列的项目招聘大量 Linux 开发人员。而且，一个知名人物也加入了这个名单。

据 Phoronix 报道，systemd 和 PulseAudio 的创建者 Lennart Poettering，现在已在微软工作，继续专注于 systemd 的开发。

或许你不知道，Lennart 曾在红帽工作，领导 PulseAudio 项目和其他一些事情。

除了 Lennart 之外，Python 之父 Guido Van Rossum 等一些关键的开发人员之前就加入了微软。

（LCTT 译注：据 Phoronix 总结，还有更多的开源开发者加入了（或加入过）微软，这包括：GNOME 创建者 Miguel de Icaza 曾在 2016 年微软收购 Xamarin 时受雇，到今年早些时候离开；Nat Friedman 作为 Xamarin 的成员在微软收购后加入，后担任微软旗下的 GitHub 的 CEO；Gentoo Linux 创始人 Daniel Robbins 之前受雇于微软；Steve French 作为 Linux CIFS/SMB2/SMB3 的维护者和 Samba 团队的成员为微软工作；以及大量的上游 Linux 开发者，如 Matteo Croce、Matthew Wilcox、Tyler Hicks、Shyam Prasad N、Michael Kelley、Christian Brauner 等等也曾被微软雇佣。）

微软在为最佳状态做准备

毫不奇怪，微软希望提高其对基于开源的项目的关注，并尽可能有效地利用 Linux 为其业务服务。

Azure 平台对开源的利用最多，而且，不要忘了 Windows Subsystem for Linux（WSL）。

因此，微软一直在招聘 Linux 开发人员。如果你想试试，你会在 微软职业 栏目中找到很多与 Linux 有关的职位。

虽然这对微软的产品线来说是一件大事，但它一般不会影响到 Linux 桌面用户。事实上，我认为，Linux 开发者得到的资源越多，由于他们工作角色转换，他们可以帮助 Linux 生态系统更好地增强其愿景。

当然，让所有关键的 Linux 开发者都在微软拥有的项目上工作并不是一件喜闻乐见的事情，但是，事实就是如此。

微软正在做正确的事情

这不仅仅是经济上的回报，Linux 开发者加入微软团队的趋势意味着他们在开源和 Linux 上的一些努力是成功的。

只要微软努力改善 Linux 生态系统，我认为我们就没有什么可担心的。

我不想被提醒“拥抱、扩展和熄灭Embrace, extend, and extinguish”（3E）。毕竟，这对所有公司来说都是生意。当涉及到赚钱的决定时，没有人应该被认为是英雄。

因此，我们只能希望微软在不久的将来为 Linux 开发者和用户准备好一些好东西。

你对此有何看法？在下面的评论区分享你的想法。

Main reason - everything I can do on Linux - I can do Windows, but not vise-versa. Ok I can't play games on Linux, I left gaming. Ok I can't run engineering software on Linux, I didn't engineer anything. I can't reverse-engineer and debug Windows software on Linux, so I didn't do that. I didn't do anything productive and positive in that period of time. I learned that in Linux you choose already written software, configure it manually in text configs (benefit: man command with manuals). And on Windows you also choose already written software, configure it via GUI or command line, or text configs. Anything changed.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This seems to be a very small distro and the dev apparently doesn't have any interest in a Reddit presence...hasn't even made it to DistroWatch yet. I'm not here to plug the thing technically, it's easy to Google, but I'm wondering if anyone's tried it yet, before I start messing with it in a VM? Any experience or thoughts on it?
 EDIT: ok, I've installed it, and here are my thoughts. It's pretty much a basic Arch install, with a moderately heavy Plasma desktop that incorporates a top menu and Latte. Not as heavy as Garuda, but more than Endeavour. The OS doesn't install everything and the kitchen sink like Garuda, but it does give you this set of startup dialogs that ask you if you want to install this stuff. Probably a better implementation than the way RebornOS or ArcosLinux does it (a huge list of checkboxes), and at least it's easy enough to close and get rid of. Not a fan of the heavy theming but they do claim to be all about the eye candy, so I'm not surprised it's there. I suppose it'll serve a purpose if it gathers enough community, but for now, I'll pass. It's filling a niche that I'm not so sure exists yet. Wouldn't mind seeing that after-install tool ported to other Arch variants though.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I had vanilla Ubuntu for ages. It worked fine. Then I started coming across videos by Distro Tube, ThePrimeagen, Brodie Robertson, Linux experiment and more, and the ecosystem opens up to me.
 I tried AwesomeWM, am currently driving LeftWM, I switched from Bash in Gnome Terminal to Fish in Alacritty, I installed Thunar, and a few more programs. I think much of these changes suit me better than vanilla Ubuntu.
 However, it has left me somewhat worried as well. I discovered these programs through YouTube. Deeper than that, I discovered that there were issues at all with my original setup. I see that things are better now, but I never stopped to notice it was bad in the first place.
 So I never thought to look for tiling window managers, never imagined that it was a thing, because I was desensitized to the floating Gnome window manager. I was doing mostly fine with Bash in GTerm, and didn't think much of it. I didn't realize that these programs had problems that could be solved before I saw videos praising the solutions.
 Is there a good way to discover this kind of minor everyday friction and check if ready-made solutions exist? Or is it mostly about having lots of feelers out and wait for word of mouth of some new software to reach you before you start to ask whether it actually solves a problem for you?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey guys, 
 During my journey in the Linux sphere I stumbled upon a lot of content, especially Youtube videos that promote the use of Firefox to counter the rise of Chromium based browsers. 
 I completely understand that using another browser than Google Chrome is important to avoid a browser monopoly but I don't really understand the war that many Linux/FOSS enthusiasts leads against Chromium based browsers.
 I don't see Blink (Chromium) as a competitor to Gecko (Firefox) but more as a successor. Gecko is old (even if heavily maintained) and is slower than Blink in many ways (it is perceptible to the end user and benchmarks proves it). 
 Blink is like Gecko an open source project and even if Google is at the lead of the project they can't really do anything that goes against the interests of the users or developers without suffering from a huge backlash. And even if they try to put their interests first there will always be communities to fork the project and remove Google's shit (ungoogled-chromium is an already existing example). And I am nearly sure that there will be in the future someone or a company to fork Blink and create a new engine, putting Blink at the same place where Gecko is currently. 
 For me the main reason to stop using Gecko based browsers is for compatibility, if all browsers end up sharing the same foundations, thanks to Blink, creating a website would be a much easier process and it might save time (and mental sanity) to a lot of developers all around the world while not compromising on privacy for the end user. 
 I am completely conscious that I might be wrong as a lot of more grown people from the community don't share my opinion but usually the explanations are limited to "do this to avoid a monopoly" so I wanted at least some reasons for this "war" against Blink/Chromium.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[据彭博社7月7日援引知情人士消息报道称，苹果公司计划推出面向极限运动员的Apple Watch，这款手表将使用迄今为止最大的智能手表显示屏、更大的电池和坚固的金属外壳。
　　上述报道称，这款智能手表的屏幕面积将比目前最大的苹果手表多出约7%，使用更大的屏幕可以一次在表盘上显示更多的健身指标或信息。显示器的分辨率约为410*502，并与现有型号保持相同的整体清晰度。上述消息或在今年晚些时候与另外两款Apple Watch一同发布。
　　此外，报道还指出，与标准Apple Watch相比，这款面向极限运动员的手表将使用坚固的金属材料而不是铝，具有更抗碎的屏幕，并包含更大的电池，可以让运动员实现更长时间的运动追踪。
　　对于上述消息，苹果发言人未发表评论。
　　Apple Watch于2015年首次发布，已成为苹果硬件产品线的重要组成部分，这些手表产品隶属于苹果可穿戴设备、家居和配饰部门，该部门在上一财年营收384亿美元，占苹果公司总收入的10%。该部门也面临与谷歌、三星电子等公司的同类产品竞争。
　　苹果预计在今年9月秋季新品发布会上公布新一代的Apple Watch，还有新一代iPhone。目前苹果在售的Apple Watch分别为去年发布的Apple Watch S7系列，老款的Apple Watch S3系列，以及低端版Apple Watch SE。
