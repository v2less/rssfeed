        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[打算为你的项目开发工作安装 Python 3.11？下面是如何在 Ubuntu 等发行版中安装 Python 3.11 的方法。




Python 3.11 于 2022 年 10 月 25 日发布，并声称比之前的 Python 3.10 版本快 10% - 60%。

一如既往，3.11 中的功能和改进列表明显较多。下面是一个简介：


错误回溯更明确，可以指出导致错误的确切语句。

引入异常组和新的 except* 语法。

你可以在基础表达式中添加自定义文本，以便在你的代码中更好地处理错误。

引入 Variadic 泛型，允许在 Python 数值库（如 NumPy）中使用类似数组的结构。

字典类型 TypedDict 得到了改进，现在你可以指定个别字典项目是必须的还是可选的。

引入了 Self 注解，允许类返回它们自己的类型实例。


还有很多，你可以在官方的 3.11 亮点页面 上详细了解。

Linux 发行版中的当前 Python 版本

Ubuntu 22.04 LTS 带有 Python 3.10，而最近发布的 Ubuntu 22.10 Kinetic Kudu 也是同样的版本。然而， Kinetick Kudu 可能会在几周内采用 3.11。

另外，Fedora 37 已经有了 Python 3.11 RC2，并将提供该版本。

所以，如果你正在运行 Ubuntu 22.04 LTS、Linux Mint 21 或任何基于 Ubuntu-LTS 的发行版，这里是你如何通过 PPA 安装 Python 3.11 的方法。

注意：谨慎地使用这个方法。确保你知道你在做什么，因为替换 Linux 发行版的基础 Python 版本可能会导致系统不稳定。许多默认的应用程序和软件包都依赖于 3.10 版本。

 a script that will install it for the current user (doesn't require sudo)
 a script that will install it for all users. the package manager can either install a package just for the user or for all users. (requires sudo)
 using the system package manager (dnf, rpm-ostree, apt, pacman, xbps, zypper, ect) to install it for all users (requires sudo)

Cody, Reshma, and Rahul here and we’re building Medplum (https://www.medplum.com), an open-source platform that lets you quickly build complex healthcare applications. We provide a headless EHR (electronic health record) that supports common standards like FHIR, HL7 and more. You build whatever UI and UX you want, and we handle the infrastructure and give you lots of interoperability and automation tools.
The digital healthcare space has been hampered by proprietary tech, walled gardens, and vendor lock-in. Working as healthcare app developers ourselves, we kept seeing organizations developing the same infrastructure over and over. The question “how is this stuff not open source?” came up so often that we finally decided to just build it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Has anyone had any success installing the amdgpu (closed source) driver when using a "mainline" kernel (6.0) as opposed to the stable kernel that ships with Ubuntu (5.19)?
 I installed the amdgpu-install package from the PPA, and running sudo amdgpu-install --usecase="hip" was successful in grabbing all the dependencies (unlike with the deb you can download directly from the AMD website), but when it came to building amdgpu-dkms I was told that my kernel--6.0.7--wasn't supported.
 I'm fine downgrading back to 6.0, but given all the improvements recently released to the open source driver that's directly in the kernel, I don't want to go back any further.
 Is there any way to get access to Blender GPU rendering, the AMF encoder and OpenCL support on Linux while also using the latest kernel (and thus open source driver) for everything else?
 I'm using a highly stripped down Ubuntu 22.04 as a base, and I'm absolutely open to distro-hopping if this is trivial to do in, say, Arch.

I really like the idea of going through every little step during installation and have everything just how I want it to be. But I do not like to idea of always have the "latest and greatest" versions of my applications. 
 I want to have a stable system as a daily driver where I do not have to struggle with os issues every day.
 Am I missing something? What's the main advantage of rolling releases for a daily driver?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[... unless we do something about our governments. 
 Let's be honest. What's holding free (as in freedom) operating systems so far behind? Are they worse? I don't think so. They might have a bit less hardware support - but most people wouldn't care. They might have a bit less software available (although debatable) - but most people wouldn't care, if it's pinta or paint.net.
 I think, although leaving a room for being mistaken, that the reason for today's Windows popularity is the fact that it's shipped in damn every single laptop (with a few exceptions in a few first world countries). People don't bother to care what their laptop is running on - and it's fair, after all, not everyone is a geek or should be.
 What I suggest, is to force laptop and desktop manufacturers to provide an option with a free OS. It doesn't have to be linux-based, as there's a couple of free non-linux OS. However, the price for this laptop should be lower by the price of Windows license, to ensure actually fair competition. If Microsoft has set a price for Windows, let people choose to pay or not for it.
 Again, free as in freedom, not as in unpaid. Although I don't know right now how to ensure that manufacturers don't exploit it (by installing some CandyCrushOS as an option to force people back into Windows ), but I do believe there's a solution.
 I think the actual outcome here will be that instead of single Windows, people will be running all kinds of operating systems, be that gnu/linux, other linux, or gnu/non-linux, or BSD, or many many more! Yet, since we're talking about free software and no dominating system, most software will be available for all systems, so we won't have a problem that something works for one system but not another one. I do believe it's possible.
 Thoughts?

As an Ubuntu user myself (I appreciate that they're not as bleeding edge as Fedora is), I became interested in the performance of a theoretically snap-mainly system.
 As that thing doesn't exist yet (Ubuntu Core exists, but I found building that a bit complicated for the quick test I wanted to perform), I decided to test the bootup times and performance of a Ubuntu system fresh, and one with a very large collection of snaps installed (582 snaps to be exact, but many of these were rather small, so the total size of the disk image is around 100GB) on a virtual machine (Gnome Boxes) under a 11400h Intel Tiger Lake CPU.

        <link href="https://www.williamlong.info/archives/6985.html"/>
        <updated>2022-11-08T14:32:08.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[11月8日，记者从GPU巨头英伟达处获悉，该公司将于第三季度投产NVIDIA A800 GPU（以下简称“A800”）。根据英伟达的说法，A800是面向中国客户的NVIDIA A100 GPU（以下简称“A100”）替代产品，A800符合美国政府关于出口管制的明确测试，并且不能编程超过该限制。


今年8月底，英伟达发布公告称接到美国政府通知，对英伟达未来向中国出口的A100和即将推出的H100集成电路实施了新的许可要求。随后在公布二季度业绩时，英伟达创始人兼首席执行官黄仁勋提出，会推出不受限制的替代版本。


对业绩增长放缓的英伟达来说，中国市场的重要性不言而喻，毕竟根据财报数据，过去一年里，英伟达从中国业务区获得了71.11亿美元的收入，占公司营收比例达26.4%。


从性能上看，根据英伟达官网介绍，A100可划分为七个GPU实例，提供40GB和80GB显存两种版本，A100 80GB可提供超快速的显存带宽（每秒超过2万亿字节），处理超大型模型和数据集。从目前媒体披露的信息来看，A800芯片数据传输速率为每秒400GB，低于A100，美方新的出口管制规定将芯片数据传输速率限制在每秒600GB。


值得一提的是，随着挖矿热潮的结束，市场对于高端显卡的需求有所下滑。从此前公布的财报数据来看，英伟达2022年二季度营收67亿美元，环比跌幅为19%；净利润6.56亿美元，环比下降59%，降回到两年前同期水准。


早在受限消息传出的9月初，芯谋研究高级分析师张彬磊就曾通过微信及电话向记者介绍，一方面，就目前国内已经商业化的一些GPU跟英伟达的差距来看，需要三至五年时间来“追赶”方能满足市场需求。但另一方面，受限将会促进国产GPU的发展，推动国内相关厂商的崛起。

        <updated>2022-11-08T13:45:03.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I created a system for building SVG-only websites called Svija.  But, though the content was nice, the sites felt too static — a bit flat and lifeless. Even a basic HTML website has mouseover effects, but SVG doesn't have them for free the way HTML does.
I wanted to find an easy way to recreate mouseover functionality in SVG. For my first try, I labeled objects in Adobe Illustrator:
  • linkSomeName: an invisible link  (over the link text)
  • mouseoverSomeName: a  mouseover decoration (usually bold or colored text, or an underline), initially hidden

Once I had used it for a bit, I thought that it might be nicer if the effects faded in and out. So, I tried animating the transitions with GSAP. It immediately became clear that there was enormous potential to manage complex animations visually, and I worked over the 
summer to create Svija Vibe.
It's all based on linking Adobe Illustrator object names to the GSAP script. Most basic transformations already work well but there's a lot I'll be able to do to make it even simpler to use.
I'm really excited about it! I've only just started but I have a million ideas about how to make it more capable — the big one being the ability to chain animations together.
There's a support document at https://tech.svija.love/how/animation that gives more detail about exactly what can be done.
Svija Vibe is free. It works with Svija, which is also free, but you do need to create an account to use it (Maconly, at least for the next three months).

It's a chrome extension that allows discussion on any webpage to happen there itself.
Currently I have built threaded comments, and a upvote/downvote system.
Plus I've built this cool feature called Highlights, which lets you discuss specific lines in any documentation. As well as a feature called Top Hightlights, which shows the most interesting hightlights on any webpage.
Hope you guys will try it out. And if you have any questions, feel free to ask me here.
Thanks.

        <id>https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33518320</id>
        <link href="https://github.com/cozodb/cozo"/>
        <updated>2022-11-08T12:25:23.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi HN, I have been making this Cozo database since half a year ago, and now it is ready for public release.
My initial motivation is that I want a graph database. Lightweight and easy to use, like SQLite. Powerful and performant, like Postgres. I found none of the existing solutions good enough.
Deciding to roll my own, I need to choose a query language. I am familiar with Cypher but consider it not much of an improvement over CTE in SQL (Cypher is sometimes notationally more convenient, but not more expressive). I like Gremlin but would prefer something more declarative. Experimentations with Datomic and its clones convinced me that Datalog is the way to go.
Then I need a data model. I find the property graph model (Neo4j, etc.) over-constraining, and the triple store model (Datomic, etc.) suffering from inherent performance problems. They also lack the most important property of the relational model: being an algebra. Non-algebraic models are not very composable: you may store data as property graphs or triples, but when you do a query, you always get back relations. So I decided to have relational algebra as the data model.
The end result, I now present to you. Let me know what you think, good or bad, and I'll do my best to address them. This is the first time that I use Rust in a significant project, and I love the experience!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[有关 Xfce 4.18 的核心和原生应用程序的功能的全面介绍。


经过近两年的开发，Xfce 4.18 将在 2022 年圣诞节期间发布。作为 Xfce 4.16 以来的重要的版本，其一直在开发标签 4.17 下进行开发，以增强这个轻量级桌面。

考虑到 GTK4 的更新、初步的 Wayland 支持，以及核心和本地应用程序的改进，Xfce 4.18 是一个重要的里程碑版本，其带来了大量更新。

从发布时间来看，第一个 Xfce 4.18 预发布版（pre1）已经发布。2022 年 12 月的第一周会有另一个预发布版。而 Xfce 4.18 的最终版本预计将在 2022 年 12 月 15 日至 12 月 29 日之间发布。

由于目前还没有官方的详细介绍，我在这篇文章中总结了 Xfce 4.18 的基本和主要功能。

请继续阅读。



Xfce 4.18 的新功能

1、核心库更新

Xfce 4.18 的依赖关系有所改变，并使用以下版本进行编译：


glib-2.0 >= 2.66

gtk >= 3.24

libcairo >= 1.16

gdk-pixbuf-2.0 >= 2.40

gobject-introspection >= 1.66


2、桌面和面板

顶部的主面板带来了新的设置和调整。但整体外观仍与以前的 4.16 版本中的一样。一些默认的面板小程序在这个版本中也有变化。桌面图标、右键上下文菜单和项目保持不变。

面板的首选项设置有两个新的选项。首先，面板的长度现在以像素设置，而不是百分比。其次，一个新的选项，“保持面板在窗口上方Keep panel above windows” ，可以让你将窗口对话放到面板后面。之前，应用程序的窗口只能达到面板的边缘。



彻底修改了时钟小程序的设置。是的，你…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[了解 Ansible 的新徽标是如何根据相关人员的意见开发的，以确保整个项目的品牌一致性。




作为红帽的用户体验（UX）设计和 Ansible 产品团队的交互设计师，我们花了大约 6 个月的时间为 Ansible 社区设计了一系列徽标。这件事其实在更早的时候就开始了，当时一位项目经理要求我们为一个幻灯片提供一个 “快速而简单” 的徽标。在收集了一些需求后，我们在几天内就向相关人员展示了一个徽标，而且没有经过太多调整。几个月后，另一个相关人员说他们也需要类似的徽标，所以我们重复了这个过程。

于是，我们注意到一个模式：像这样的徽标资源不仅仅代表个人的要求，而是整个 Ansible 项目的共同需要。在完成了几个徽标要求后，我们有了一系列临时的设计，但在没有意识到品牌和设计惯例的情况下，这可能给整个 Ansible 的品牌视觉造成了不一致。随着这个徽标系列的增加，我们认识到了这个迫在眉睫的问题，并需要解决它。

我们的解决方案是创建一个 Ansible 设计系统，这是一个针对品牌的资源，可以指导未来一致的徽标设计。

什么是设计系统？

设计系统是一个可重复使用的资源和指导方法的集合，有助于告知任何数字产品套件的视觉语言。设计系统创造了一些模式，将独立的产品整合在一起，并通过可扩展性和一致性提升品牌。

特别是在一个有多种产品的大公司里，如果没有标准化，扩展起来就不容易，因为不同的团队对每个产品都有贡献。设计系统可以作为每个团队建立新资产的基线。有了标准化的外观和感觉，产品在整个组合中被统一为一个家族。

从头构建一个设计系统

在收到相关人员提出的为 Ansible 开源社区（如 Ansible Builder、Ansible Runner 和Project Receptor）创建徽标的一系列要求后，我们决定为我们的工作流程设计一个结构，并创建一个单一…]]></summary>

        <updated>2022-11-08T03:06:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[本指南旨在帮助你在 Firefox、Chrome、Chromium 和 Edge 等流行的网页浏览器中启用深色模式。


我们都喜欢深色模式。与标准浅色模式相比，许多人更喜欢它。许多桌面应用原生提供深色模式，而一些应用则是通过桌面环境的底层模式适应深色模式。

不可否认，我们都在网页浏览器上花费了很多时间。我们很少使用桌面应用（除非你从事专门的工作，例如视频编辑等）。因此，当你花费大量时间在浏览器中阅读和学习时，你始终可以选择深色模式。不过，对于网页浏览器，启用深色模式的方法略有不同。

本指南为你提供了在 Firefox、Chromium、Chrome 和 Edge 浏览器中启用深色模式的简单步骤。

在网页浏览器中启用深色模式

在 Firefox 中启用深色模式

打开 Firefox 并点击右上角的菜单。

单击 “设置Settings > 扩展和主题Extension and Themes”。

选择 “深色主题Dark Theme” 并点击 “启用enable”。你应该会看到深色模式已应用于 Firefox。



在 Firefox 浏览器中启用深色模式



深色模式下的 Firefox

要将其还原，请按照相同的步骤并选择浅色主题。

Chromium 和 Chrome 中的深色模式

默认情况下，Chromium 或 Chrome 不会预安装任何深色主题。因此，你需要前往 Chrome 应用商店并下载你想要的深色主题。对于本指南，我会推荐超过一百万用户使用的 “Morpheon Dark” 主题。

从 Chromium 浏览器打开 Morpheon Dark 主题页面（以下链接）。


Chrome 应用商店中的 Morpheon Dark 主题


点击 “添加到 ChromeAdd To Chrome” 按钮。它应该会在 Chrome 中启用。

你可能想探索 Chrome 应用店中提供的其他深色或浅色主题。 访问此页面获取所有深色主题的集合。

但是，你应该要记住的一件事是：此主题不会更改设置或上下文菜单，这是显而易见的。因为它只是改变了浏览器窗口，而这些菜单（有时）是操作系统本身的一部分。



Chromium 深色主题

对 Chrome 浏览器也遵循相同的步骤。

Edge 浏览器 – 深色模式

但是，Edge 浏览器 默认带有更好的深色主题。它允许你从设置中使用 GTK+、浅色和深色模式。

打开 Edge 浏览器，点击右上角的三个小点。

转到 “外观Appearance” 并选择 “深色Dark”。这样应该就好了。

Edge 的这种深色主题实现更好，因为它改变了上下文菜单和地址栏。



深色主题的 Edge

总结

如果你是高级用户，你可能不需要本指南。你可以自己弄清楚。

但我们为所有读者涵盖了所有基础到高级教程。许多新的 Linux 用户可能不知道如何在浏览器中启用深色模式。

所以，就是说，我希望这对你和其他人有帮助。如果你遇到任何问题，请在下面的评论框中告诉我。

To give a sense of the scale of this claim: If correct, Zhang's work is the most significant progress towards the Generalized Riemann Hypothesis in a century. Moreover, I think this result would not only be a more significant advance than Zhang's previous breakthrough, but also constitute a larger leap for number theory than Wiles' 1994 proof of Fermat's Last Theorem (which was, in my opinion, the greatest single achievement by an individual mathematician in the 20th century).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm curious if there are any paid services that offer to fix Linux issues. Not just a support team--but it would include support. For example, I have a weird issue in Firefox right now where scrolling "sputters" only occasionally, and usually only in Reddit. There are plenty of helpful forums, but I also want to focus on business problems and would rather some other expert could help me fix this in a jiffy.
 I think it would be so cool if I could subscribe for $50/mo to $150/mo to a company that would take my support issues seriously--either help me to resolve them if possible, or if unable, escalate to a team of expert Linux software engineers who could dig into the various systems, subsystems, and open source software code, and fix them. I would happily pay this monthly fee for the assurance that my Linux laptop works beautifully. If my issue results in a software patch, all the better for the community.
 I'm not a corporate customer, so I don't think Redhat Enterprise is a fit here. But maybe someone could correct me if I'm wrong.
 Does something like this exist?

I personally find it easier to focus on dead trees, so much so, I'm thinking of investing in a duplex lazer printer and I know it seems very "boomer" and I'm reminded of this Progressive Ad, but I find it to be less distracting and easier to focus. I feel I would better focus on the Arch Wiki or the Gentoo Handbook or ffmpeg docs if it was on dead trees.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[systemd 252 如预期的锁定了 Linux 引导过程

之前，我们 报道 过，systemd 创始人发文指出 Linux 引导过程不安全，并提出采用加密签名的统一内核镜像（UKI），使用 TPM 2.0 硬件加强 Linux 系统启动过程的安全性。UKI 将 Linux 内核和 initrd，以及一些其他的小组件，合并到一个文件中，允许整个文件被加密签名。在刚刚发布的 systemd 252 中，几个重要的功能都与新的 UKI 全签名启动过程有关。除此以外，还很一些重要特性也值得关注。


消息来源：The Register



老王点评：我是觉得 sytemd 有些激进了，虽然确实 systemd 在引入新特性方面进展很快。




Mastodon 用户激增

在埃隆·马斯克接管 Twitter 的一周内，Mastodon 激增了 23 万名用户，月活用户已达 65 万。但与 Twitter 相比，仍然非常少，Twitter 有将近 “2.38 亿日活用户”。其创始人说，“它显然没有 Twitter 那么大，但它是这个网络有史以来最大的。”Mastodon 出现于 2016 年，可以免费使用，也没有广告，由一个非营利组织开发的，并通过众筹获得支持。


消息来源：CNN



老王点评：没用过，也不知道是啥。




Arc 显卡的更新只能在支持英特尔 ME 的系统进行

英特尔管理引擎（ME）是隐藏在英特尔 CPU 中的一个操作系统，它是一个修改版的 MINIX 3，运行在用户根本接触不到的 -3 层。这个事情我们以前 介绍 过。根据 Fwupd 开发者的消息，至少现在，英特尔的 Arc 显卡只能通过 ME 来更新其图形系统控制器的固件。因此，旧的英特尔系统或非英特尔系统，如 AMD、RISC-V 等系统，将无法更新 Arc 显卡的固件。


消息来源：Phoronix



老王点评：这显然是越来越封闭了。从最近的一些趋势来看，一些硬件厂商看似开放，其实本质上还是想各种办法封闭起来。]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[你上次更新通过 Pip 安装的 Python 软件包是什么时候？大多数用户往往会忘记这些 Python 软件包也需要手动更新，因为仅仅更新系统存储库对于软件包来说是不起作用的。

因此，让我们花点时间看看如何使用 Pip，来更新旧的 Python 软件包吧。

如何使用 Pip 升级 Python 软件包

Pip（Pip Installs Packages） 是一个用于管理 Python 软件包的 命令行实用程序command line utility 。你可以将 Pip 安装 Python 软件包，类比为在 Ubuntu 和 Debian 中使用 apt 管理软件包那样。

因此，接下来就让我们深入了解如何使用这个极好的工具 Pip，来管理与 Python 软件包相关的内容吧。

1、列出过时的 Python 软件包

在计划更新什么软件包之前，我们先要列出有哪些过时的软件包，你可以在其中选择想要更新的软件包，因为大多数人不会想一下子更新整个软件包库。

要列出过时的 Python 软件包，你只需将 pip 命令与 list 选项、--outdated 标志一同使用即可，如下图所示：

pip list --outdated




2、升级特定的软件包

获得可更新的软件包列表后，你可以像我之前提到的那样，选择你要更新的那个特定的软件包，pip 升级软件包命令的语法如下：

pip install package_name -U


例如，我想将名为 anime-api 的软件包升级到最新版本，所以我将使用下面的命令来升级：

pip install anime-api -U




3、将软件包升级到特定的版本

没有必要总是使用软件的最新版本，如果你想将软件包升级到不是最新的某个特定版本，参考如下的命令语法：

pip install --upgrade <package>==<version>


例如，我想将名为 xdg 的软件包更新到 5.1 版本，5.1 版本是最新版本的前一个版本，所以可以使用以下命令：

pip install --upgrade xdg==5.1




4、使用 Pip 一次性升级所有软件包

请注意：我不建议你一次性升级所以软件包，因为 Python 软件包的依赖项太复杂了，一次性的升级无法处理相互依赖项。

要一次性升级所有 python 软件包，你可以使用以下命令：

pip3 list --outdated --format=freeze | grep -v '^\-e' | cut -d = -f 1 | xargs -n1 pip3 install -U




上面的命令使用了 xargs。首先，会得到所有需要更新的软件包，然后对每个软件包执行 pip3 install -U 命令。

我在这里使用的是 pip3，而不是 pip。在 Ubuntu 22.04 及更高的版本中，pip 和 pip3 命令都可以使用。

总结

使用 Pip 一次性更新所有 Python 软件包并不是一个好主意。我发现一次性更新后，软件包之间的依赖关系被破坏了，所以请确保只更新你想要更新的软件包。

如果你还有其他的疑问，就请在评论区中留言吧。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[想知道如何在台式机或笔记本电脑上检查 Ubuntu 和其他 Linux 中的 CPU 和硬盘温度？这是一个快速指南。


如果你是普通用户，那么实际上不需要检查 CPU 或 HDD 温度。但是，如果你使用的是非常旧的硬件或轻薄型的硬件，你可能会遇到过热问题。因为这些薄的硬件内部紧密耦合在一起，无论做了多少传热机制，它都会升温。因此，必须监控硬件的温度。然而，现代 Linux 发行版能够通过软件传感器很好地处理过热情况。

在 Ubuntu 上监控 CPU 和硬盘温度的步骤

使用终端

我们将使用几个包来实现相同的目的。在基于 Ubuntu 的系统中打开一个终端并安装以下内容。

sudo apt install hddtemp
sudo apt install lm-sensors


hddtemp 程序为你提供硬盘和 SSD （根据我的测试）的温度。 lm-sensors 包为你提供来自 CPU 和其他通过 PCI 端口访问的传感器的温度详细信息。

安装后，从终端运行以下命令。你需要知道你的磁盘标识符，例如 /dev/sda 或 /dev/sdb 等。

要找出磁盘标识符，你可以使用 fdisk。

sudo fdisk -l


然后运行以下命令检查 HDD 或 SSD 温度。

sudo hddtemp




来自终端的 HDD 或 SSD 温度

检查 CPU 温度和其他信息需要额外的步骤。

首先，运行以下命令，以便传感器程序可以检测到系统中的传感器。

sudo sensors-detect


上面的命令可能会问你一些是/否的问题。继续按回车选择默认选项。

完成后，运行以下命令查看 CPU 和其他接口温度。

sensors




使用传感器

使用 GUI 工具

如果你更喜欢能完成上述所有操作的漂亮 GUI，你可以安装 psensor。该程序适用于 Linux 系统，例如 Ubuntu、Fedora、Arch 和其他变体。它为你提供了漂亮的图形和表格视图：

Ubuntu 及其衍生版：

sudo apt install psensor


Fedora 和基于 RPM 的衍生版：

sudo dnf install psensor


Arch、Manjaro 和类似的衍生版：

pacman -S psensor


安装后，从终端运行 psensor 或从应用菜单启动它。

正如你在下面的截图中所见，它通过漂亮的图表让你可以很好地了解 CPU、GPU 和 HDD 的所有重要温度。使用它的首选项，你可以根据需要对其进行调整。这个轻量级的程序在很多情况下都会很有帮助。



psensor 运行

因此，这些是你可以在 Ubuntu 和其他 Linux 系统中监控 CPU、GPU 或 HDD 温度的一些方法。如果你知道其他方法，请通过下面的评论栏告诉我。

 Customizing the desktop to my preferences.
 Using an app store is the way of the future, 1 click installs are way better than downloading exe files off the internet.
 Updating the whole system with 1 click which would take about 30 mins to do for every app on windows.
 Even the most bloated DE is light compared to windows and doesn't kill my PC.
 Open source apps are genuinely great and polished, I've switched to LibreOffice for school work, and so has my university, our PCs now run Ubuntu.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I just discovered this recently and I am quite curious.
 Anybody have any experience with their software?
 ​
 They mention even having a secure hypervisor, which actually brings to question. How well "hardened" are these hyperisors like Proxmox?
 I don't think Ubuntu comes with anything like Selinux. Which is why I often wished Proxmox would be based on rhel or distro based on that.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have a ton (2-3 TB) of home recorded videos and photos on my debian server, that I would like to view on my Samsung TV using the built in uPNP/DNLA client. I do not need alle kind of weird clients, etc, etc, just for my wife and I to be able to walk down memory lane on the TV. So, I really only need to be able to browse by year/month and have something that lists the entries in date/time order. The video clips are typically less than a couple of minutes long, so they need to be served pretty quick, delays of 10-15 seconds when browsing really kills the experience. 
 I would like a simple service on my debian server, that either runs in a container or from the apt system and automatically transcode the source material to something the TV can understand. However, it seems really complicated, with kodi requiring visual configuration, UMS apparently not very good at transcoding, and so on.
 At this point I would really appreciate some tips to a simple solution that works well with a newish (2021) Samsung TV. I prefer OSS -- what media server should I focus on? Jellyfin? 
 Thanks in advance for any help.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Every time I do a fresh install, I get an itch to just go all FLOSS with my games and not install Steam. But after a little scrolling and maybe a few installs/deinstalls, I realize that the games in the repo are just not up to par.
 One wonders if there is some specific rule that new games just can't fulfill in order to get included in the repo. But that can't be the case because a whole 2 or 3 games actually look presentable. Tux kart looks good and playable, and 0ad is probably the best looking game and the only game I have seen that actually gets good regular updates and it feels like some effort has been put into it. Xonotic is nice, but it couldn't compete even with the game from 1999 it tries to imitate. Super tux is also good.
 A few honourable mentions that look like they tried - the rips of old tycoon games, red alert looks interesting (though I haven't tried it), the absolutely boring and empty minecraft clone, the few city building games...
 And the rest is just on a level below windows 98 minesweeper - projects a student could make as homework. 
 I refuse to believe that there are no people who can make good sprites, good mechanics, and nice-looking games that look and feel like they were made in this century. 
 So, purely logically, if there are 2-3 games that actually look ok-ish, then that means it is possible to put such games in the repo. The question remains why would people rather put their games in the AUR then have them in the repo, which I think is a high honor and good for the users as well because they don't have to mess with the AUR?
 Does the repo maybe require the maker to regularly update the game or something that people are not willing to do? 
 I just don't get it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi HN! We’re building an open-source pricing & packaging engine for SaaS with a built-in billing system. (https://github.com/uselotus/lotus).
We strongly believe pricing is the largest untapped growth lever for SaaS, primarily because pricing affects so many critical systems that don’t talk to each other (billing, payments, feature limits, metering, and CRM). We’re building this infrastructure to fix this and enable quick experimentation.
Lotus acts as a central repository for all of your pricing plans and utilizes your payment gateway, to manage usage-based, per-seat, and custom enterprise pricing. We’re excited to open-source this because we want to enable developers to build their custom pricing and integration edge cases on top of this base.
We’ve launched this repo under an MIT license so any developer can use the tool. Give it a spin for us at either:
* test our cloud version at (https://demo.uselotus.io)
* self-host here (https://github.com/uselotus/lotus) 
and let us know what you think.
All feedback is appreciated! If the project is especially relevant to you, follow us and we’ll keep you updated when we’ve fully published all our beta features.

I still have a lot of things I want to build, but now seemed like a good time to put it out there: even if the results aren’t nearly the quality I’d like, I’ve still found it useful and I want to show it off!
I’ve been working on it since September 2021, but only in fits and starts. The entire thing runs on a computer in my living room (there’s a picture on the About page); I haven’t done any load testing so we’ll see how it holds up.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[据路透社报道，推特5日正式推出全新订阅服务，每月收费8美元，以向用户提供蓝色认证标记(“蓝V”)，同时在苹果应用程序商店App Store推出更新版本。这是马斯克对推特的第一次重大修订。据悉，新服务目前仅供美国、加拿大、澳大利亚、新西兰和英国用户使用。马斯克表示，一旦确认新服务运作良好，并完成相关翻译工作，将会在全球各地推广。


据报道，在针对苹果iOS设备的更新说明中，推特表示，“立即注册”的用户可花费每月7.99美元在他们的用户名称旁边加入广受欢迎的“蓝V认证”，“就像你所追踪的名人、企业和政治人物一样”。


据iOS更新通知，订阅方案的其他好处还包括广告量减半、可上传较长的影片、以及根据内容质量排列推文等。


在马斯克接手推特之前，“蓝V认证”意味着推特确认该帐户的真实身份为个人或公司拥有。但推出全新订阅服务后，目前尚不清楚推特如何在收费之外验证用户的身份。


据悉，这项新服务目前仅提供美国、加拿大、澳大利亚、新西兰和英国用户使用。


马斯克5日发布推文称，“一旦我们确认新服务在首批试行国家运作良好，并完成相关翻译工作，这项服务就会在全球各地正式推出。”

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[GitHub Copilot 被诉“规模空前的软件盗版”

周四，有程序员在旧金山提起诉讼，称其代表数百万可能受每月 10 美元的 Copilot 服务影响的 GitHub 用户。该诉讼旨在挑战 GitHub Copilot 的合法性。诉讼对象包括 GitHub 其所有者微软，以及为该工具提供支持的 OpenAI。该诉讼认为“被告已经侵犯了大量创作者的合法权利，这些创作者在 GitHub 上根据某些开源许可证发布代码或其他作品。”包括 MIT 许可证、GPL 许可证和 Apache 许可证等 11 个流行的开源许可证，都要求注明作者姓名和版权。Copilot 违反并删除这些许可证，“因此，它正在实施规模空前的软件盗版行为。”


消息来源：IT Pro



老王点评：虽然可能是旷日持久的诉讼，但是目前的 AI 没有理会开源许可证就直接拿过来用代码的方式，肯定是有问题的。




经过六年等待，Rust 终于支持通用关联类型了

最新的 Rust 稳定版 1.65.0 支持了通用关联类型（GAT），可以在关联类型上声明生命期、类型和常量泛型。Rust 官方称，“很难用几个字来形容这些东西有多有用。”为了支持 GAT，必须对编译器进行大量的修改，而这项功能的 RFC 是 2016 年提出的。总的来说，GAT 为大量的模式和 API 提供了基础性的依据。大量项目因为 GAT 的稳定而受阻。即使你不需要直接使用 GAT，你所使用的库也很有可能在内部或公开场合使用它，很多时候，GAT 是唯一实现方式。


消息来源：Slashdot



老王点评：Rust 越来越发展完善，真的可以预期成为主要的底层语言。




谷歌计划建立支持世界上 1000 种最常用的语言的 AI 模型

该公司公布了一个经过 400 多种语言训练的 AI 模型，它将其描述为 “目前在语音模型中看到的最大的语言覆盖范围”，并宣布建立一个支持 1000 种语言的模型。谷歌认为，创建一个如此规模的模型将使其更容易将各种人工智能功能带入在线空间和人工智能训练数据集中表现不佳的语言（也被称为 “低资源语言”）。谷歌称，建立单一模型，而不是建立 1000 种不同的模型，有助于 AI 将从高资源语言获得的能力转化为低资源语言的能力。

老王点评：这样的进展，或许过几年，不需要专门学习外语了。]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[安卓的一个重要进展是将安卓开源项目Android Open Source Project（AOSP）移植到 RISC-V 处理器架构。




AOSP 已经开始在上游启用 RISC-V，这将促进 RISC-V CPU 在可穿戴设备、物联网，以及最终在智能手机和笔记本电脑中的使用。

为了开放生态系统，中国科学院 PLCT 实验室的工程师和软件开发人员在 2020 年开始将 Android 10 移植到 RISC-V 架构上。阿里巴巴的云计算部门和平头哥芯片子公司一起努力保持开发与最新的安卓版本同步。

“我们很高兴看到谷歌对构建针对 RISC-V 的 AOSP 的更多支持！阿里云一直致力于通过一系列的创新来支持 RISC-V 社区的发展，比如将安卓的基本功能移植到 RISC-V 上，这证明了在从多媒体到信号处理、设备互联和人工智能等场景中使用基于 RISC-V 的设备的可行性。”阿里云生态系统总监、RISC-V 国际组织的应用与工具水平委员会副主席 David Chen 博士说：“我们期待着与安卓团队合作，为繁荣的 RISC-V 社区做出贡献。”

通过增强 RISC-V 上的安卓系统的基本功能，在 2021 年，阿里云的专家们付出了巨大的努力，积极推动了软件生态系统的发展。 RISC-V on Android 的工作集中在 RISC-V Android 工作组和软件库中进行。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[git log 命令是 Git 中一个很重要的查看提交记录的工具，它也是人们喜欢使用 Git 的原因之一。


git log 命令能够让你了解到更多关于贡献者 提交commit 的记录。使用 git log 的一种方式是按日期查看提交记录 。要查看在指定日期或日期范围内创建的 Git 存储库中的提交记录，请使用带有选项 --since 或 --until 或者同时使用以上两个选项的 git log 命令。

首先，进入你要查看的分支（例如，main 分支）：

$ git checkout main


接下来，你可以使用以下命令，来显示当前日期（即今天）的提交记录：

$ git log --oneline --since="yesterday"


仅显示某一特定用户（例如，用户 Agil）在今天的提交记录：

$ git log --oneline --since="yesterday" --author="Agil"


还可以显示在某一日期范围内的提交记录。使用以下命令，显示在任意两个日期之间（例如，2022 年 4 月 22 日至 2022 年 4 月 24 日）的提交记录：

$ git log --oneline --since="2022-04-22" --until="2022-04-24"


在上面这个例子中，会输出 2022 年 4 月 22 日至 2022 年 4 月 24 日期间，不包括 2022 年 4 月 22 日的所有提交记录。如果你想要包括 2022 年 4 月 22 日的提交记录，请将命令中的 2022-04-22 替换为 2022-04-21。

运行以下命令，能够显示某一特定用户（例如，用户 Agil）在两个指定的日期之间的提交记录：

$ git log --oneline --since="2022-04-22" --until="2022-04-24" --author="Agil"


总结

Git 有很多优点，其中一个优点就是 Git 让你能够收集你项目的相关数据。git log 命令是一个重要的查看提交记录的工具，也是人们喜欢使用 Git 的原因之一！

I've tried altering the dpi and system wide font settings but I end up missing the extra screen real estate too much.
 I've found the Hover Text accessibility feature on Mac to be the perfect solution for this; it renders whatever text your mouse is currently hovering over at a high resolution as long as a key is held down, and I believe the font and contrast can be customized. So far I can't find any such equivalents in my system's package database. The programs I have tried all spawn a persistent window that takes up significant amounts of space, and rather than rendering just the text they instead blow up everything in a specific screen region, resulting in highly pixelated text obscured by irrelevant background noise.
 If a package doesn't already exist for it I would be willing to figure something out myself, even despite a lack of experience. The closest approximation I can think of off-hand would be to make a custom script that spawns an xzoom window on key-press, but that seems kind of fiddly and doesn't address the issue of the pixelated text. Is there a small cli program I can use to grab just the text string itself? Any other solutions or ideas would be greatly appreciated.

        <updated>2022-11-06T00:29:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[这个带有脚本的快速指南有助于清理旧的 Snap 版本并释放 Ubuntu 系统中的一些磁盘空间。


我正在使用的 Ubuntu 测试系统中的磁盘空间不足。因此，我通过 GNOME 的磁盘使用分析器进行调查，以找出哪个包正在消耗宝贵的 SSD 空间。除了通常的缓存和主目录，令我惊讶的是，我发现 Snap 和 Flatpak 消耗了大量的存储空间。



尽管如此，我始终坚持一个规则：除非必要，否则不要使用 Snap 或 Flatpak。这主要是因为它们的安装尺寸和其他问题。我更喜欢原生 deb 和 rpm 包。多年来，我在这个测试系统中安装和移除了一定数量的 Snap 包。

但卸载后还有问题。Snap 在系统中保留了一些残留文件，一般用户不知道。

所以我打开了 Snap 文件夹 /var/lib/snapd/snaps，发现 Snap 保留了以前安装/卸载的软件包的旧版本。

例如，在下图中，你可以看到 GNOME 3.28、3.34 和 Wine 都被删除了。但它们还在那里。发生这种情况是因为 Snap 的设计，它在正确卸载后保留已卸载软件包的版本。



或者，你可以在终端中使用：

snap list --all




对于保留的版本，默认值为 3。这意味着 Snap 会保留每个软件包的三个旧版本，包括活动版本。如果你对磁盘空间没有限制，这是可以的。

但是对于服务器和其他情况，这很容易遇到成本问题，它会消耗你的磁盘空间。

但是，你可以使用以下命令轻松修改计数。该值可以在 2 到 20 之间。

sudo snap set system refresh.retain=2


清理 Snap 版本

在 SuperUser 的一篇文章中，Canonical 的前工程经理 Popey 提供了一个简单的脚本，它可以清理旧版本的 Snaps 并保留最新版本。

这是我们将用来清理 Snap 的脚本。

#!/bin/bash
#Removes old revisions of snaps
#CLOSE ALL SNAPS BEFORE RUNNING THIS
set -eu
LANG=en_US.UTF-8 snap list --all | awk '/disabled/{print $1, $3}' |
while read snapname revision; do
    snap remove "$snapname" --revision="$revision"
done


将上面的脚本以 .sh 扩展名保存在一个目录中（例如 clean_snap.sh），赋予它可执行权限并运行。

chmod +x clean_snap.sh


当我运行脚本后，它减少了很多磁盘空间。该脚本还将显示要删除的包的名称。





结束语

对于 Snap 的设计效率如何，人们总是争论不休。许多人说，它的设计是坏的，是臃肿的，是消耗系统资源的。这种说法的某些部分是真实的，我不会否认它。如果实施和加强得当，整个沙盒应用的概念是很好的。但我相信，与 Snap 相比，Flatpak 工作做得更好。

也就是说，我希望这可以帮助你清理一些磁盘空间。尽管它只在 Ubuntu 中进行了测试，但它应该适用于所有支持 Snap 的 Linux 发行版。

此外，请查看我们关于 如何清理 Ubuntu 的指南以及其他步骤。

最后，如果你要清理 Flatpak 应用，请参阅 这篇指南。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Back in 2003, there was a Brazilian distro called Kurumin, made by Carlos Eduardo Morimoto, which was a LiveCD based on Knoppix.
 It was incredibly famous and many people here had their first experience with Linux with this distro.
 In 2004, another project was started with the idea of expanding Kurumin... Big Linux.
 The then-new project was and still is, lead by Bruno Gonçalves, known as Big Bruno.
 In fact, in the very beginning, Big Linux was just a remastered Kurumin with more preinstalled stuff.
 Kurumin has been defunct since 2008. 
 But Big Linux remains active, has been, for 18 years. Although the project went dormant and almost got discontinued several times.
 It was based on Debian until 2021, when it was rebased to Manjaro (and by extension, to Arch Linux).
 Which means it's now a full blown rolling-release distro which packs the latest and greatest versions of almost all packages, including Linux 6.0.6 kernel and KDE Plasma 5.26.2 
 It has its own artwork, in-house built tools, and a few custom desktop layouts to choose from. And of course has a ton of preinstalled software (living up to its name)!
 The system is, as expected, due to its Manjaro base, very stable and fluid!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am working full remote right now(programming/gamedev) and I travel several times a year for periods of up to two months. Because of specifics of my job I need to have a powerful workstation(I mostly need a powerful CPU) and I am comfortable with at least two 27" monitors. Traveling with that much stuff is only possible with a car, and even then the whole setup takes too much space.
Laptops are getting there with the compute power, but the 27" monitors aren't getting any smaller. Meta Quest Pro(which seems to be the top of the line now) has been just released and even tho it is somewhat pricey($1500), it still costs as much as three good 27" monitors.
Does anyone have any useful experience to share on working in a VR headset? Is it comfortable for longer periods of time? How is it on the eyes?

 The service has both a web app and mobile apps (Android and iOS) and does not even require registration! This is a breath of fresh air because other apps like this will require an app to be downloaded on your phone, a registration and possibly a paid upgrade if you don't want ads.
 Decided to share it here because the developers doubt the significance of this app.
 There is a demo instance available for everyone to fiddle with - try it, no more guessing how much money you owe to whom on a group trip.

一位工程师用两台不带显示器的 Commodore 64 “古代”电脑作为键盘，用五寸软盘粘在一起作为风箱，制作了一台可以演奏的手风琴。这个项目采用了大量定制的软件和硬件黑科技。通过测量风箱挤压时通过的空气噪音并转换为信号。Commodore 电脑本身没有音频设备，音频信号是通过插孔输出发声的。Commodore 64 是有史以来最畅销的电脑，于 1982 年开始生产。

Web 之父说 Web3 根本不是互联网

发明 Web 的蒂姆·伯纳斯-李在里斯本周五举行的 Web 峰会上表示，“真正的 Web3 的名字被以太坊的人拿去做区块链的东西，这真是一个耻辱。事实上，Web3 根本就不是 Web。”Web3 是科技界的一个模糊的术语，用来描述一个假设的未来版本的互联网，它比今天更去中心化，而不被各大巨头所支配。他认为需要澄清 Web 3 和 Web 3.0，并开发了自己的 Web 3.0 项目 Solid。

老王点评：名词并不重要，重要的真正有用，依我看，Solid 也是空中楼阁，未必比以太坊等 Web 3 项目有希望。

但是，在 Ventoy 出道之前，WoeUSB 是用于创建可启动 Windows USB 的首选工具。原版 WoeUSB 工程在 2014 年左右香消玉损。

鉴于其流行程度，一位新的开发者接过了将其起死回生的任务。因此，WoeUSB-ng 诞生了。在这里，“ng” 是 新生代new generation 的缩写。换句话说，WoeUSB-ng 是新生代的 WoeUSB 。但是，因为原版的工具已经不存在了，我将 WoeUSB-ng 描述为 WoeUSB 。

在这篇教程中，我将向你展示如何在 Ubuntu Linux 上安装 WoeUSB 。我也将分享使用 WoeUSB 来创建可启动 Windows USB 的步骤。

但是，在此之前，让我们快速查看这个令人惊叹的工具的特色。

WoeUSB



WoeUSB 是一个简单的工具，其唯一的目的是 在 Linux 上创建可启动 Windows USB 。

原版 WoeUSB 是一个 shell 脚本。这个原版 WoeUSB 被使用 Python 重写为 WoeUSB-ng ，它可以安装在你的系统上，并且通过命令行或 GUI 界面。

特色：


支持老式 PC 启动或 UEFI 启动

支持 FAT32 和 NTFS 文件系统

支持使用物理安装盘或磁盘镜像作为源

它可以用于 Windows Vista 及其更高版本的任意语言或变体版本

老式的 MBR/IBM PC 兼容启动模式

本机 UEFI 启动支持 Windows 7 及其更高版本的镜像（仅限于将 FAT 文件系统作为目标的情况）


在 Ubuntu 和其它的 Linux 发行版上安装 WoeUSB

据英国天空新闻网报道，埃隆·马斯克当地时间11月4日在推特发文回应推特公司裁员一事，马斯克在推特中写道：“关于推特公司裁员，不幸的是，当公司每天亏损超过400万美元时，这别无选择。每个离开的人都得到了3个月的遣散费，这比法律要求的高出50%。”


美国亿万富翁埃隆·马斯克近期完成了对推特的收购交易，此前有媒体曝光，他计划裁员50%。综合英国路透社、美国全国广播公司（NBC）最新报道，推特公司当地时间3日晚间向员工发布电子邮件通告，公司方将从4日早上开始通过电子邮件方式告知员工是否被裁员。


推特发送裁员通知，员工“一片混乱”


全球首富、特斯拉CEO埃隆·马斯克近期完成了对推特的收购交易。有媒体曝光，他计划裁员50%。综合英国路透社、美国全国广播公司（NBC）最新报道，推特公司当地时间3日晚间向员工发布电子邮件通告，公司方将从4日早上开始通过电子邮件方式告知员工是否被裁员。


据环球网援引NBC报道，推特通告称，“我们认识到这将影响到一些为推特做出了宝贵贡献的人，但不幸的是，为确保公司成功发展，这一（裁员）行动是有必要的。”


报道还称，一名推特员工透露，11月3日的这封电子邮件是在马斯克于当地时间10月27日收购推特后，推特工作人员首次收到来自公司的联系。关于这封邮件的影响，这名员工还说："完全是一片混乱，一屋子（人）都崩溃了，所有人都在盯着这封邮件。”


推特公司还表示，该公司的办公室将被暂时关闭，暂停任何门禁卡等证件的访问权限，以“帮助确保每名员工以及推特系统和客户数据的安全”。


值得注意的是，推特员工当地时间3日在美国旧金山联邦法院提起集体诉讼，指控推特在没有给予足够通知的情况下启动大规模裁员，违反联邦和加州法律。


在马斯克完成收购后，他对推特的改造计划受到关注，多家外媒报道称，他计划裁员50%。新加坡《联合早报》称，早些时候有消息称推特被收购后将裁员75%，但马斯克对此予以否认。不过，葛伯川崎财富和投资管理公司首席执行官戈贝尔说，管理马斯克资产的家族办公室负责人伯查尔告诉他，推特即将进行裁员，“预计大约有50%的人会被解雇”。


《华盛顿邮报》称，据知情人士透露，推特员工总数超过7000人，马斯克团队正在决定第一轮裁员计划，目标是裁掉约1/4的员工。


美国多家大型科技公司宣布裁员


宣布裁员的远不止推特一家公司，受通货膨胀加剧和经济形势恶化的影响，美国多家大型科技公司当地时间3日宣布裁员或暂停招聘。


据中新社消息，总部位于美国旧金山的在线支付公司Stripe首席执行官帕特里克·科里森3日在给员工的备忘录中说，公司将裁员14%。根据该备忘录，Stripe将把员工人数减少至约7000人，这意味着本轮裁员将影响约1100人。


科里森说，在通货膨胀加剧、经济衰退、利率上升、能源危机、投资预算紧缩和创业资金短缺的影响之下，裁员是必要的。


出行共享公司Lyft当日也宣布了裁员计划。在发给员工的备忘录中，Lyft首席执行官洛根·格林和总裁约翰·齐默表示，公司将裁员13%，所有部门都将受到影响。Lyft有5000多名员工，公司在3日提交的一份文件中确认了“解雇约683名员工”的计划。


美国有线电视新闻网报道称，亚马逊3日表示，受经济环境影响，公司计划暂停招聘数月。另外，谷歌母公司“字母表”、脸书母公司元宇宙平台等大型科技公司也纷纷加大了成本控制的力度。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[以下是快速检查在运行 Xorg 还是 Wayland 显示服务器的方法。


随着时间的推移，现代 Wayland 显示服务器正在进入所有 Linux 发行版。尽管老旧的 Xorg 仍然能用并且会继续存在，但 Wayland 无疑在安全性和其他性能方面更好。

但是，Xorg 不会很快完全淘汰。可能永远不会。

如果你在运行任何 Linux 发行版，如何检查运行的是 Xorg 还是 Wayland？下面是方法。

Wayland 或 Xorg：你在运行哪一个？

在你的 Linux 发行版（例如 Ubuntu、Fedora、Arch 等）中打开一个终端窗口（CTRL+ALT+T）。

然后输入以下命令并回车：

echo $XDG_SESSION_TYPE


命令输出会告诉你当前会话是 Wayland 还是 Xorg（X11）。

[debugpoint@fedora ~]$ echo $XDG_SESSION_TYPEwayland




这很简单。但是，还有其他方法。

其他方法

使用设置

如果你需要图形方法，请打开你的 Linux 发行版的设置应用。在关于部分，你应该看到某个标签下中的 Wayland/X11。

例如，在 GNOME 设置中，你可以在 “窗口子系统Windowing system” 下找到它，如下图所示：



使用会话值

你还可以使用 systemd 登录管理器 loginctl 找到它。请记住，它仅适用于基于 systemd 的系统。

打开终端并运行以下命令。你可以看到会话 id 值。在此示例中为 c2：

loginctl


现在，将会话 ID 传递给以下命令以获取显示服务器类型。确保将 c2 更改为你的系统规格。

loginctl show-session c2 -p Type




总结

这些是你可以确定在 Linux 系统中运行的是 Systemd 还是 Xorg 的一些方法。你还可以在 shell 脚本中使用上述命令来实现进一步的流程自动化。

祝好。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[我向所有的 Linux 初学者推荐以下这些命令。




在使用 Linux 命令行时，很容易就会迷失方向，这可能会导致灾难性的后果：我有一次使用删除命令 rm 删除文件，然而删除之后我才意识到我刚刚是删除了计算机的引导目录。后来，我学会了使用 pwd 命令，来知道当前在文件系统的哪个目录下；并且我使用了 trashy 和 trash-cli 这一命令行回收站工具（LCTT 译注：在删除文件时 trash-cli 会充当中间人，将文件先“删除”到桌面上的垃圾箱中，能够通过垃圾箱或通过终端的 trash 命令，来恢复垃圾箱中已删除的文件。）

当我刚开始使用 Linux 时，我有一个放在桌子上的“速查表”，它就是《101 条你应该知道的 Linux 命令》，我在管理 Linux 服务器时能参考速查表上面的这些命令。随着我越来越熟悉这些命令，我越来越精通服务器管理了。

以下是我认为最有用的 12 个 Linux 命令。

1、打印工作目录（pwd）

pwd 命令会打印出你的工作目录。换句话来说，它输出你当前所在目录的路径。pwd 命令有两种选项：-L 或 --logical（即逻辑路径）用来打印当前的目录路径（不解析符号链接），-P 或 --physial（即物理路径）会打印出解析符号链接后的物理目录。（LCTT 译注：你可以进一步阅读我们翻译的 另一篇文章。）

2、创建目录（mkdir）

使用 mkdir 命令来创建一个新目录，是非常容易的。以下命令，创建了一个名为 example 目录（若 example 已存在，则无法创建）：

$ mkdir example


你也可以在嵌套地创建目录及其子目录：

$ mkdir -p example/one/two


如果目录 example 和目录 one 都已存在，则仅会创建目录 two…]]></summary>

Backstory essay: I'm 6 years into my career. I spent 5 of those in the same company - company A, working up from a Grad engineer to an SDE3, 3 promos, in that company. I had a very few stumbles there and always performed and handled transition pretty well.
I jumped ship January of this year over company changes, projects getting cancelled and stopping from a revolving door of Product heads coming in and out. My goal is not to get a senior title but to progress in my knowledge and move on from JS over to a Java focus. I want to build a product or even just some features; I want to code and earn my way to seniority; not start and stop every quarter.
I move to the next company, Company B, in March as SDE; everyone else on…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey Guys, I don't know if this is the right sub to ask this, if not, please could you tell me which is? Here I go: 
 I'm currently a beginner web developer. I haven't been on this career path for very long but do have a degree in software engineering so I know some basic stuff. A friend contacted me saying that he wants me to work/start as a devops in his company. He says he has an instructor that will guide and train me for the role. The work will be remote and the work is contact based, like projects and stuff. I'm not worried about the pay since this is an opportunity for me to get some work experience. So, I want to be prepared before the project starts as I have approximately 2 months. 
 Can you guys recommend a course that teaches me the basics of DevOps? I mean the technical side? I have searched around and found this course https://zerotomastery.io/courses/devops-bootcamp/ Will this be helpful to me? 
 Also, do you this will count as work experience? I mean if the project lasts 3 - 4 months?
 Thank you.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Around 10 months ago i made a post, saying how much the gnu/linux desktop experience had improved that year alone and here i am, doing it again. Think of it as a huge "thank you" to the developers of FOSS projects who made all this improvement possible.
 But seriously, looking even 10 months back, the linux desktop looked and felt completely differently. A lot of stuff has improved since then, plasma 5.24, 5.25 and now 5.26 have been huge updates to overall stability and responsiveness of the desktop and so have gnome versions 41, 42 and now 43. It's to a point where I can confidently say that the major linux desktops are on par with or even more polished than windows and MacOS. 
 Further more, linux gaming (on AMD at least) is to a point where i ask anyone with an AMD graphics card that they only use for gaming and uses windows... why? So many gaming enhancement tools have become prevalent to aid linux gaming in not only matching windows but in some ways even beating it . From the heroic games launcher, GE-Proton, xanmod kernel, GE kernel to mangohud and vkbasalt. All these tools are basically "linux exclusive" and some of them (GE-Proton and vkbasalt) even provide functionality that you cannot easily get on windows (having FSR upscaling on any game of my choosing can be a savior for low end systems or for older games that don't support native 1080p). All of these tools, combined with the general improvements to steam mean that for 99% of games on linux, the experience is: click install, wait, play. (excluding the like 3 games like Destiny 2 or Valorant that don't run)
 And let's not forget about the general performance improvements with every mesa driver, proton/wine or even linux kernel update (6.0 personally gave me a nice ~5% bump).
 And once again, thank you to all the developers and contributors who made all this possible!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[2022年11月3日，提供了超过1100万本书的大型数字图书馆Z-Library的域名被美国邮政检查局查封，其DNS服务器也被没收，该网站提供了超过1100万本书和8400万篇文章，这吸引了稳定的用户群和数百万月度访问者。他们是否会以新域名重新上线，或者逐渐消失，还有待观察。


Z-Library上的书籍主要来自各个出版商，很多都是各种畅销书，格式有epub和kindle格式等等，书籍都没有DRM加密，可以下载到任何电子阅读器或平板电脑上。


普通用户每天可以下载10本书，如果需要每天下载更多书籍，需要每月缴纳几美元的订阅费。不过，Z-Library的使命一直是非商业性的，旨在为所有人提供无限制的免费访问。


据维基百科上的介绍，Z-Library（简称z-lib，前身为BookFinder）是一个电子图书馆和文件分享计划，用户可在此网站上下载期刊文章以及各种类型的书籍。根据Z-Library的说法，截至2022年6月12日，其共收录了10,456,034本书和84,837,646篇文章。Z-Library在其电子书搜索页面上宣称自己是“全球最大的数字图书馆”，并在文章搜索页面上称自身是“全球最大的科学文章存储库”。项目页面的页脚写有“自2009年起提供免费电子书”的字句。Z-Library跟Sci-Hub和创世纪图书馆一样，同是相对较著名的影子图书馆，出版商和政府组织在处理反盗版事宜时，通常会把这三个项目归类为同一类。]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[用这个方便的捕鼠器比喻来理解编译代码。


源代码必须要经过编译才能够运行程序，而对于开源软件，每个人都可以获取源代码。无论你是自己编写了代码，想要编译和运行它，还是下载了某人的项目来尝试它，了解如何通过 编译器 处理源代码，以及编译器如何处理这些代码，这都很有用。

创建一个更好的捕鼠器

一般情况我们不会将一个捕鼠器比作电脑，但不管你信不信，它确实与你正在使用的设备（手机或电脑）的 CPU 有一些相似之处。经典的捕鼠器（我说的不是 🐈）有两种状态：打开或者释放。你可以认为 打开 是将捕鼠器设置好准备捕获老鼠，以及 释放 是捕鼠器被老鼠触发。某种意义上来说，捕鼠器就像是一台有鼠标的电脑。你可以想象一下这个代码，用一种虚构的语言来描述这个过程：

if mousetrap == 0 then
  There's a mouse!
else
  There's no mouse yet.
end


换句话说，你可以基于捕鼠器的状态发现是否有老鼠（数据）。当然，捕鼠器不是万无一失的，有可能有一只老鼠在捕鼠器旁边，由于老鼠还没有触发捕鼠器，所以它的状态还是 打开 的。因此该程序可以进行改进，这都是非常典型的。

开关

总的来说，捕鼠器就是一个开关。你会在家里使用开关打开灯。可以从开关中获得许多信息。比如，人们会从你家灯的状态了解到你是否在家。

你可以根据邻居家灯的状态来改变行为。如果邻居家所有的灯都熄灭了，那么请关掉你大声的音乐，因为人们可能已经上床睡觉了。

CPU 也使用这样的逻辑，只不过乘以几个数量级，缩小到了微观级别。当 CPU 在特定寄存器上接收到电信号时，可以触发其他一些寄存器，然后触发另一个，以此类推。如果这些寄存器有特定的意义，那么就可以通信。也许激活同一主板上某处的芯片，或者使 LED 亮起，或者改变屏幕上的像素颜色。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Linux Lite 6.2 是一个理想的升级，带来一些有用的变化，没什么太花哨的东西。




Linux Lite 是一种流行的轻量级的类 Windows 发行版，为用户提供了一个熟悉的操作系统感受。

最新版本 Linux Lite 6.2 基于 Ubuntu 22.04 LTS，对 UI 进行了各种更改以及各种错误的修复。

Linux Lite 6.2：有什么新功能？



此版本的 Linux Lite 侧重于用户界面调整和错误修复，并对一些应用程序进行了更改。

一些主要亮点包括：


更新的图标

新壁纸

Shotcut 视频编辑器

删除微软 Teams

LibreOffice 7.3.6.2

Linux 内核 5.15


Shotcut 取代 OpenShot



是的，Shotcut 现在取代了 OpenShot，成为 Linux Lite 6.2 上的默认视频编辑器。

OpenShot 之所以被删除，是因为它不能很好地与 Ubuntu 22.04 配合使用，而如果没有一个好用的视频编辑器，用户将不得不自己寻找一个。

Shotcut 无疑是一款出色的视频编辑器。所以，应该是一个不错的选择。

微软 Teams 已删除

另一个重大变化是微软 Teams 不再包含在发行版中。

其原因是微软停止了 Linux 应用程序，转而支持一个渐进式 Web 应用程序版本。

我们之前的报道可以让你更深入地了解：


微软决定放弃 Teams 的 Linux 应用，代之以渐进式Web应用


更新的图标和新壁纸



Linux Lite 6.2 具有最新的 Papirus 图标集以及一系列新的 Linux Lite 主题壁纸。

这应该会给发行版带来用户可能喜欢的焕然一新的外观。

🛠️ 其他更改和改进



其他值得注意的变化包括：


任务管理器的更新

改进了 Lite 升级应用程序中的结束对话。

各种应用程序的最新更新、错误修复等。


你可以阅读完整的发行说明以 了解更多信息。

Linux Lite 6.2 看起来是对以前版本的令人满意的升级，有许多重大的变化和补充。

📥 下载 Linux Lite 6.2

你可以从其官方网站下载最新的 ISO 或使用 Lite 升级工具升级到它。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Somewhat pissed, a tiny bit laughing. I don't usually post, just lurk. After going through all that, I just want to vent a bit. I suggest you read this before going in. This is my personal addition of several issues that I had, which made me almost quit Windows, even though I couldn't.
 I saw the top post somewhat earlier today. Didn't think much of it. I knew that I had a Windows 10 installation due for later this day. Whatever. I've installed Linux. Windows is usually pre-installed so I've never dealt with the process fully.
 It wasn't pleasant. Cortana exists as a veil to what lies underneath. The installation process took 15 minutes or so. Then, after all that, to my sense of humor's delight in anti-climactic irony, it boots into Recovery Mode with error code 0x000000e. After tinkering with boot options I was able to boot from the USB and wiped the drive.
 Now it just goes into diagnostics mode. Great. More work.
 -
 I'm tired of Microsoft's mess. Can't we just have a peaceful install process? Can Windows Update work fine without any issues? I wanted to add my thoughts as too many straws have been broken. Unfortunately, as I work in drafting, almost every CAD software is only available for Windows. Linux was a breeze for most of the time I've used it. If I mess up, I know or understand why and I'm able to backtrack, at least on certain distributions. Whenever Windows fails, it just seems like a brick-wall unless I talk to someone whose entire IT repertoire is diagnosing Windows.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[For the most part I've been using a V8-based browser as my default one. But after a recent re-install of the system I took a moment to take a break until I finish my post-install shell script, which I'm planning to extend with facilities that would enable me to add custom search engines to the browser, testing the default Firefox for this purpose.
 But you can imagine my surprise when I could NOT find such a built-in option in Firefox other than adding them via extensions. But come on guys, it's been a widely known and I assume a popular option in V8-based browsers for ages, I don't even remember when they introduced this functionality so long ago it was. After all, a regular user like me may not find the search engine extensions published on Mozilla web-store satisfactory or even there at all...
 I was thinking about sticking with Firefox after re-install. But now I have to reconsider this option, alas...
 REALLY REALLY SURPRISED! Or, am I so blind not to see the obvious?! Please correct me if I'm wrong.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[近日，赛迪顾问软件与信息服务业研究中心通过广泛调研，编制完成了《中国服务器操作系统市场研究报告（2022H1）》（以下简称“报告”）。报告从市场规模、市场结构和市场特点三方面对 2022 年上半年中国服务器操作系统市场发展情况进行了分析，并从国内产业生态的角度切入，深入分析了现阶段 openEuler 生态的发展情况。当前，以 openEuler 为代表的中国开源社区正在构建以自主技术为核心的产业生态，国产服务器操作系统已经具备产品有开发者社区、有知识产权，高安全、高可用、可定制、可重构的特性。

此前，在工业和信息化部举行的“新时代工业和信息化发展”系列主题新闻发布会上，信息技术发展司相关负责人在答记者问时，表示：“支持成立国内首家开源基金会——开放原子开源基金会，加速孵化开放鸿蒙、欧拉等一批开源项目，推动开源代码托管平台发展，优化壮大开源社区，如欧拉开源社区用户数量超 60 万人，合作单位超 380 家。在服务器操作系统方面，推动服务器操作系统与主流 CPU、数据库、中间件等软硬件的兼容适配，加快提高产品国际竞争力。如，欧拉操作系统终端部署量超 170 万套。”肯定了当前时期国内操作系统产品和生态取得的成就。

报告选取了政府、运营商、金融、能源四大行业市场逐一分析，并对中国服务器操作系统未来的发展趋势进行了研判。赛迪顾问业务总监高丹在 2022 开放原子全球开源峰会 openEuler 分论坛上对报告内容和数据进行了发布和披露。

报告显示，从整体市场来看，2022 年上半年中国服务器操作系统装机量继续高速增长，较上年同期增长 11.7%，达 195.9 万套。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[11 月 3 日，2022·云栖大会上，阿里云智能总裁张建锋表示，以云为核心的新型计算体系正在形成，软件研发范式正在发生新的变革，Serverless 是其中最重要的趋势之一，阿里云将坚定推进核心产品全面 Serverless 化，帮助客户更好地实现敏捷创新。

“我们希望让用户做得更少而收获更多，通过 Serverless 化，用云就像用电一样简单。”张建锋表示，Serverless 将让云计算从一种资源真正变成一种能力，未来云将全面 Serverless 化，更加接近“电网”模式，按计算的调用次数付费。



Serverless 让软件研发产生根本性改变 

Serverless 并不是不用服务器，恰恰相反，它将服务器全权托管给了云厂商，根据业务流量大小自动弹性伸缩，开箱即用免去维护成本，按使用量计费。用户无需关心和管理底层IT资源，只要聚焦业务代码，根据实际请求处理业务。

依托于 Serverless 架构，云上研发方式正在发生根本性的改变。从过去的集中式研发、分布式研发，到云上的组装式研发，实现了软件研发的服务化、模块化、可编排、可组装。无论是 2 万用户还是 2000 万用户体量，基于 Serverless 构建的 IT 架构都可以自适应伸缩，峰值秒级自动扩容、峰谷自动缩容。

作为国内首家投入 Serverless 的云厂商，阿里云早在 2017 年就推出首款 Serverless 产品——函数计算，开发者只需编写代码并上传，函数计算就会自动准备好相应的计算资源，大幅简化开发运维过程。

目前，阿里云已经拥有超过 20 款 Serverless 产品，包括函数计算 FC、Serverless 应用引擎 SAE、Serverless 容器服务 ASK、PolarDB 数据库、AnalyticDB 数仓等。其中函数计算日调用次数超过 200 亿次，有效支撑历年双 11 百万 QPS 洪峰，业务年均增速超 300%，整体规模位居国内首位。



初创公司和大型企业都在使用 Serverless

“以前搞大促我们技术团队都睡不着觉，要时刻盯着服务器水位，心里都没谱”，世纪联华是最早试水 Serverless 的新零售代表，联华华商技术负责人楼杰表示，“现在我们不用管理服务器这些基础设施，只要编写代码上传，函数计算就会准备好计算资源，水位远远高于我们储备能力的极限。”世纪联华将会员系统、交易系统、支付系统等迁移到阿里云函数计算上处理，促销准备时间从周级缩短到小时级，研发运维提效 30%，成本下降 40%，真正把促销活动变成常态。

流媒体平台南瓜电影，因为一场热映电影 1 小时内增加了 100 万用户，是当时日常流量的 5 倍以上，流量暴涨引发网站服务一度中断，临时云上扩容也无法及时满足巨大的流量。了解到 Serverless 的优势后，南瓜电影果断将系统直接部署到阿里云  Serverless 应用引擎 SAE 上，不用改造应用代码，直接上传部署 WAR/JAR 包，省去了购买服务器和运维的过程，“云上资源想弹多少弹多少，想什么时候弹就什么时候弹。”峰谷时按需自动缩容，七天内就完成了新架构的升级和部署，总成本下降  40%，运维效率提升 10 倍，从容应对突发流量。

除了广泛应用的小程序外，Serverless 还受到电商大促、音视频转码、AI 算法、游戏分发、物联网等场景的青睐。权威分析机构 Gartner 预测，2025 年将有 50% 以上的全球企业采用 Serverless 架构。]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[11 月 3 日，在 2022 云栖大会上，阿里云智能总裁张建锋发表主题演讲，他认为历经十多年的发展，云计算带来的变革依然被严重低估，它正在重构整个 IT 软硬件和终端世界，形成一个全新的计算体系。新一轮的科技变革正在深入发展，阿里云将坚持技术长征，面向下一代体系去构建第二技术曲线，抓住未来技术的定义权。

张建锋认为，以云计算为核心的新型计算体系，正在带来三大变革：首先，云重构了整个 IT 硬件体系，数据中心、芯片、服务器等产业链发生深刻变化；其次，软件研发范式发生深刻变革，Serverless、低代码、AI 大模型开源等趋势，大幅提升软件生产效率；最后，云和端加速融合，算力从端转移上云，未来万物皆是计算机。



重构整个 IT 硬件体系

张建锋回顾云计算演进历程，过去十多年，云的创新主要集中在软件领域，首先出现了分布式虚拟化，而后实现了资源池化，形成了广泛的应用规模。现在，云计算已经从软件创新，走向软硬件协同创新，用云来定义整个 IT 硬件体系。

今年，阿里云发布了一款云数据中心专用处理器 CIPU，替代 CPU 来管理和加速计算、存储和网络资源。这是一种全新的架构方式，代表着云计算深入到数据中心内部做体系化创新。CIPU 实现了全面专用硬件加速的高性能，包括高带宽、高吞吐和弹性 RDMA 的能力。“飞天+CIPU”的组合性能表现普遍优于业内同类产品，性能可提升 20% 以上。

在此基础上，阿里云基础设施已经广泛基于 CIPU 架构进行建设，并且构建了全栈自研的基础设施，例如自研 CPU 芯片倚天 710、磐久服务器、EIC 高性能网卡、磐久交换机、磐久液冷一体机、磐久液冷集装箱等自研硬件。

去年，阿里巴巴发布了首款“为云而生”的芯片倚天 710。目前，倚天 710 云实例已在多家互联网科技公司大规模应用，算力性价比提升超 30%，单位算力功耗降…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've been using Linux for a few months now, and due to some software I need for college I had to set up dual-booting on my laptop. 
 I never realized just how horribly slow the install process on Windows is. When I first installed Linux Mint, installation was nearly instant, and everything just worked out of the box. With Windows, it's screen after screen of setup. Honestly it's almost less hassle to manually install Arch.
 The thing that really stuck out to me, though, is about halfway through the installation, Windows popped up a screen saying "We're giving you a free trial of Microsoft Office"
 Whatever, I click Ok
 Next screen: "Please confirm your credit card info, you will be charged $99.99 when your free trial ends"
 Really? I haven't even installed the OS yet and you're already trying to scam me out of $100? Not to mention that they already had my credit card info pre-filled out, despite the fact that I don't think I've ever given them permission to store my credit card info
 This was followed by a few screens of ads (still in the installation media) before having to wait several more minutes until it finally installed. I then had to spend several minutes uninstalling all the bloatware that comes with Windows (Or at least what Windows lets me uninstall. Why can't I uninstall the "Your Phone" app?)
 Sorry if this post is a little off topic, but I just wanted to share the moment that made a new-ish Linux user become a lifelong user. I can't see myself ever going back to a full installation of Windows.

is exactly what was recently posted to the mailing list. 
The change targets the C source code in the myriad of packages that the
distribution ships; it would fix code that uses some ancient compatibility
features that were removed by the C99 standard but are still supported by
GCC.  As might be guessed from the 
long runway proposed, there is quite a bit of work to do to get there.]]></summary>

Statcounter 是一个网站分析服务，在 150 万个网站上安装了跟踪代码，记录每个网站的数十亿次页面浏览。据 Statcounter 最新数据，安卓占全球所有操作系统份额为 42.37%，Windows 30.11%、iOS 17.6%、OS X 6.24%、除了安卓之外的 Linux 1.04%。而就桌面市场而言，Windows 占 75.93%，OS X 15.74%，Linux 2.6%，Chrome OS 2.38%。对于移动市场，安卓占 70.96%，iOS 28.43%。

老王点评：安卓的成功，也是移动操作系统的成功，也是广义上的 Linux 的成功。




英国准备立法废除传真机

传真机由施乐公司在 1964 年商业化，1980 年代起被世界各地的企业广泛使用，如今已被电子邮件、扫描仪、云端传真和即时通讯服务所取代。虽然传真机早已过时，但英国卫生服务机构仍在大量使用它，英国国家医疗服务系统现在还有数百台传真机。英国通信监管机构 Ofcom 表示它准备修订电信规则淘汰传真机。


消息来源：The Register



老王点评：之前利用互联网发送传真都被视作违法，而现今，几乎没有人用传真了。




OpenSSL 3 漏洞补丁释出，危险程度比预想要轻

由于 OpenSSL 3 出现了严重安全漏洞，原计划在 10 月底发布的 Fedora Linux 37 延迟发布。现在，OpenSSL 3 发布了补丁，修复了两个缓冲溢出漏洞。漏洞等级从之前被认为与“心脏流血”漏洞相当的“超危”降为“高危”。这两个漏洞影响所有 OpenSSL 3.x 系列，不过目前主要使用的版本 OpenSSL 1.x 不受影响。


消息来源：Phoronix



老王点评：还好，不过互联网安全需要更可靠安全的 SSL 实现。]]></summary>

 This is, by far, the best premium looking Linux desktop of all time IMHO.
 It IS stable, functional and visually consistent.
 Note: There’s a “Basic” and an “Enhanced” or “Pro” edition. 
 The Basic one looks a bit bland and very different from the Professional edition shown in the video. 
 And yeah both are Free of charge.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Introduction
 Last weekend I had the time to find a secondary Linux distro for my laptop, I use Fedora as my main distro, and thought that I would share my thoughts about the ups and downs of the distros that I tried. Distros tried: Arch, FreeBSD, Gentoo, openSUSE (Tumbleweed and Leap), NixOS, Debian 11.
 Arch
 So I used Arch on my previous laptop for over a year and was quite excited, the main reason I wasn't using Arch already is because I got a beefier laptop and wanted to try out some commercial distros.
 Pros:
  
arch-install: I liked the new arch-install, I think it's actually a good looking upgrade to the initial script, most things were very intuitive and I think it's slowly opening Arch up to newer audiences
 AUR: The AUR alone is one of the main reason to use Arch, it makes softw…]]></summary>

 ​
 id like to hear what you all like or dislike!

 Edit: I've received a lot of good information, thank you all. since Opensuse will be discontinuing leap in the near future my plan will be to install Fedora on an older machine and test it out for a couple weeks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[本文介绍我使用 Terraform 五年之后吸取到的经验。




使用 Terraform 五年的经历让我吸取到一些重要经验。无论团队大小、项目性质，有五条要点对于配置合乎逻辑且可用的 Terraform 平台至关重要。

1、了解你的目标受众

这一点似乎显而易见，但我也见过一些在这方面犯错的案例。当组织和规划 Terraform 的相关代码时，无论是将目录结构标准化还是确定命名规范，考虑目标受众是非常重要的。例如：你的团队是否会使用这些 Terraform 脚本和模块？你是否会向其他团队交接工作？你的团队是否会有新成员加入？你是否正在独自进行项目开发？你是否会半年或一年后仍然使用这些配置，还是会将它安排给别人？

这类问题会影响某些决策。理想情况下，无论如何都应该有 远程状态Remote State 和 状态锁定State Locking 两种状态。远程状态确保你的笔记本电脑不是你的 Terraform 唯一运行的机器，状态锁定确保同一时刻只有一个人对基础设施进行修改操作。

命名规范应该对项目的最终拥有者有意义，而不是只对开发团队有意义。如果项目会转交给其他团队，应该确保他们对命名规范有发言权。如果代码由非技术的利益相关者或内部安全/ GCR 团队负责审查，应该确保他们会检查命名规范。另外，对于资源名称，为了让代码审查人员更仔细地进行检查，你应该使用资源标签，把有关的数据分类/隐私需求（高、中、低）标示出来。

2、重用，重用，重用

Terraform 注册表 为大多数普通用例提供了现成模块类库。我已经使用过 VPC 模块和安全模块中的大量功能，这些功能只需要提供相关的参数就能使用。使用不同的参数，简单调用这些模块对于处理大部分用例已经足够了。尽可能多地重用这些公共模块，可以避免大量且重复的编码、测试、检查、修复、重构等操作。

我也发现，基于…]]></summary>

 Love the aesthetic but it felt sluggish - Geekbench confirmed slower than W11 on the same hardware (test ran several times).

 Anyone know why Zorin would have such a performance penalty given it's based on Ubuntu?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello!
 I am pleased to announce my thirteenth ebook Computing from the Command Line. This is the longest book I've published so far (203 pages) and it took me more than 7 months to complete the first version.
 This ebook aims to teach Linux command line tools and Shell Scripting for beginner to intermediate level users. The main focus is towards managing your files and performing text processing tasks. Plenty of examples are provided to make it easier to understand a particular tool and its various features. Exercises at the end of chapters will help you practice what you've learned and solutions are provided for reference. I hope this ebook would make it much easier for you to discover CLI tools, features and learning resources than my own blundering experience.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[这是在 Ubuntu 和其他 Linux 系统中安装 Viber 的快速指南。


Viber 是一个免费、安全的通话和聊天程序，适用于所有流行的移动平台和操作系统。

它具有丰富的功能，例如语音/视频通话、支持 GIF 的文本消息、贴纸、照片和视频。此外，Viber 还具有群聊、群呼和消失消息功能。

Viber 是一个闭源程序，但有免费的 Linux 原生可执行客户端。

下面是安装它的方法。

在 Linux 上安装 Viber

它以 AppImage 可执行文件、deb 和 rpm 包的形式提供。按照下面的相应按钮直接下载。平均可执行文件大小约为 180MB。


下载适用于所有 Linux 发行版的 Appimage



适用于 Ubuntu 的 Deb 可执行文件



Fedora 的 RPM 包


如果你已下载 AppImage，只需从任意文件管理器将权限更改为可执行文件即可。然后运行。

对于 Ubuntu、Linux Mint、Debian 和相关发行版，你可以通过多种方法安装 deb 包。

你可以通过已安装的软件管理器双击打开。或者通过 dpkg 命令安装，如下所示。

sudo dpkg -i viber.deb


对于 Fedora 和基于 RPM 的软件包，你可以通过以下命令安装。

sudo dnf localinstall viber.rpm


对于 Arch Linux 和其他发行版，你可以使用我上面提到的 Appimage。

使用

完成安装 Viber 后，通过应用菜单打开它。以下是你需要记住的几件事。

在从笔记本电脑/台式机开始使用 Viber 之前，你需要在手机上进行设置。从以下链接为你的移动平台下载并安装 Viber。


谷歌应用商店

苹果应用商店


安装后，设置 Viber。请记住，它需要你的手机号码才能注册。

设置完成后，在 Linux 桌面上打开应用。你应该会看到如下页面。



从你的手机应用扫描二维码，你应该可以在 Linux 桌面上使用 Viber。

注意： 由于它是一个闭源应用，请确保你在使用 Viber 时了解此应用的条款和与隐私相关的情况。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[欧盟新法律可能迫使苹果公司开放其核心利益

欧盟新的《数字市场法案》（DMA）于今天生效，进入六个月的实施阶段，将于名年 5 月 2 日开始适用。DMA 将适用于符合其 “看门人” 标准的科技巨头，并迫使他们向其他公司和开发者开放其各种服务和平台。苹果几乎可以肯定被列为“看门人”，因此将受到 DMA 的约束。这可能迫使苹果公司让用户访问第三方应用程序商店，并允许在 iPhone 和 iPad 上进行应用程序侧载，使用第三方支付系统，访问苹果收集的数据，以及提高 iMessage 互操作性等等。


消息来源：Mac Rumors



老王点评：不能不说，欧盟的这些法律极大地制裁了那些垄断巨头。




Mozilla 公布它的 Manifest V3 扩展方案

Manifest V3（MV3）是 Chrome 的新扩展规范，Chrome 将从明年 1 月开始逐步淘汰之前的 MV2 扩展。Mozilla 的 MV3 和谷歌的 MV3 之间有些区别，最重要的是没有采用谷歌的声明式网络请求（DNR），而保留了 MV2 的 WebRequest API。这也是新的扩展系统引发广泛争议的地方，广告屏蔽扩展如 uBlock Origin 使用 WebRequest 在广告下载前屏蔽其请求。


消息来源：Solidot



老王点评：我觉得 Mozilla 这次做的很好。




Meta 宣称其 AI 音频编解码器提供 10 倍于 MP3 的压缩率

上周，Meta 公司宣布了一种名为 “EnCodec” 的人工智能驱动的音频压缩方法，据说可以将音频压缩到比 MP3 格式小 10 倍的 64kbps，而且人耳听不到质量损失。其关键是识别人类无法察觉的变化，他们使用鉴别器来提高生成的样本的感知质量，该模型通过让重建的样本与原始样本在感知上更加相似来生成样本以“欺骗”鉴别器。


消息来源：Ars Technica



老王点评：通过 AI 分析人耳不能识别的部分，从而“骗过”鉴别器，这真是一种巧妙的方法。AI 越来越做到一些人所做不到的地方。]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[11月2日，马斯克在推特上发文称：“推特目前不能让每个人加蓝V的做法太糟糕了，就像阶级制度一样。现在每个人都有权利加蓝V了，每个月8美元。”


据悉，推特过去是根据认证通过的个人资料才会给用户“加蓝V”，但这个过程不会收费。而本次马斯克突然一改推特以前的做法，有媒体称是因为马斯克在研究推特“加蓝V”的机制后提出的。


在最近的一项民意调查中，超过80%的推特用户表示他们不会为“加蓝V”付费，其次是10%的用户表示每月仅愿意支付5美元（约合人民币36元）。


同时，推特原本针对“加蓝V”用户一项可选的附加收费功能Twitter Blue，服务费将从每月4.99美元涨至20美元。据悉，Twitter Blue可自定义导航栏和撤销推文等。

对于这一做法，畅销书作家斯蒂芬·金在推特上写道：“如果这样做，我就会离开（推特平台）。”


早先，在经历了半年的拉锯后，马斯克终于以440亿美元完成对推特的收购，从而获得对该公司的控制权。根据纽约证券交易所的退市通知，10月28日，推特从纽交所退市。接管后，马斯克迅速“血洗”管理层，解雇了包括原推特CEO、CFO在内的多名高管，由马斯克接任该公司唯一董事。


另据报道，马斯克已于上周六下令裁员。推特原有约7500名员工。据《华盛顿邮报》报道，首轮裁员幅度可能达到25%，主要目标是那些近期对代码库没有贡献的中层管理人员和工程师。裁员预计将从本周开始，管理人员已经列出了被裁员的员工名单。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[11月1日，腾讯最大股东、南非Naspers集团荷兰子公司Prosus发布声明称，媒体公司“亚洲科技”（Asian Tech Press）文章称中信集团正组团与Naspers谈判以收购其持有的全部腾讯股份，该文是猜测性的，不符合事实。中信集团也透过媒体表示报道不实。


据证券时报，虽然外资是大股东，但是腾讯一直高度由创始人控制的管理团队运营，是民营企业。如果外资选择卖给中信集团，则意味着国有资本成为大股东，有可能打破现在的经营体制，所以外界高度关心此事。


Naspers集团在声明中称将继续执行今年6月宣布的开放式股票回购计划，该计划的资金来源是定期和有序地出售集团持有的少量腾讯控股的股票。Naspers董事会与Prosus董事会重申对腾讯的长期前景仍有信心，并认为该股份回购计划符合Prosus、Naspers及其各自股东的最佳利益。


Prosus资产净值报表显示，截至10月28日，Prosus仍持有26.926亿股腾讯股票，与港交所披露文件显示的9月9日Prosus持股数量一致，意味着Naspers在9月9日至10月28日的时间内阶段性停止减持腾讯股票的动作。


据中国基金报，中信集团也回应了，11月1日，针对中信组团收购腾讯股份的消息，中信集团相关人士表示：“传闻不实，无相关计划。”


另据第一财经，记者向接近中信投资端人士了解到，目前并不存在所谓“中信组团收购腾讯股票”的事情。多位投资界人士也对记者表达了对该传言的否认。


11月1日中午12:34，腾讯公关总经理张军在朋友圈转了一首歌曲《流言》，并配文称：“流言传来传去，说不停不知道何时能停息。”


Naspers是一家总部位于南非开普敦的大型跨国科技传媒集团，成立于1915年，并于1994年在约翰内斯堡交易所上市，主体业务已经从传媒转型成全球性互联网文娱和投资。2001年，Naspers投资腾讯3200万美元（约合人民币2.3亿元），获得46.5%的股权。


Prosus（AEX：PRX）则是Naspers的子公司，为提升融资能力，Naspers打包所持的腾讯等互联网公司资产，于2019年在荷兰挂牌上市。


此次传言中涉及到的股份，主要是指Prosus所持有的腾讯股份，历史上经过IDG二次出售、腾讯上市、以及2022年南非报业集团大幅频繁减持，Prosus目前持股比例降至9月8日的27.99%。


但需注意的是，腾讯股权采取VIE架构，单一大股东并不具备投票权，仅具备分红权。截至11月1日收盘，腾讯控股股价227.4港元，涨10.6%，创近七日新高。


以腾讯的最新的2.19万亿港元市值计算，目前Naspers所持股份的市值超过6000亿港元（约合人民币5555亿元），如果真有交易，那绝对是中外资本市场交易中罕见的大手笔。


据中国基金报，此前，在10月24日晚间有消息称，中国移动可能入股腾讯。对此，腾讯方面回应称，该消息不实。

        <link href="https://linux.cn/article-15203-1.html?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss"/>
        <updated>2022-11-02T03:28:03.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Vanilla OS 是建立在 GNOME 上的、具有按需不变性和软件包选择自由的 Ubuntu。听起来很有趣？在这里阅读更多信息。




这正是我第一次接触 Vanilla OS 时的想法。

当 Bottles 的创建者 Mirko Brombin 在 Twitter 上宣布它时，让我对它产生了兴趣 😎。

我加入了他们的 Discord 频道并成为了一名测试者。虽然我没有做出什么贡献，但关注项目发展是很有趣的。

回到至关重要的问题上：什么是 Vanilla OS？

Vanilla OS 的目标是提供一个干净、原味的 GNOME 体验，并具有按需不变性的能力。

听起来很有趣？让我告诉你我试了试它的第一个开放测试版本后的一些细节。


💡 Vanilla OS 计划在 11 月有一个稳定的版本。

它将跟随 Ubuntu 的小版本发布。

因此，你可以期待每年发布两个版本。例如，你可以从 Ubuntu 22.04 升级到 Ubuntu 22.10 甚至更之后的版本。

除非你知道自己在做什么，否则你不应该把它作为日常系统来使用。


Vanilla OS：又一个基于 Ubuntu 的发行版？



是，也不是。

对于初学者来说，我认为有以下独特的理由可以尝试一下：


在 Ubuntu 之上获得 原装 GNOME 体验。（Fedora 也是一个很好的选择，但并不适合所有人！）

在其安装后的首次设置时，允许你选择并启用 Flatpak/Snap/AppImage。

按需不变性，意味着你可以使系统变成只读，以防止来自第三方应用程序和更新的关键变化。

一个新的软件包管理器（apx）允许你默认在管理的容器内安装软件包。


首次设置过程的体验很轻松。


ℹ️ 目前，它使用 Calamares 安装程序。他们打算用 Crystal Linux 中使用的 Jade 取代它。




越来越多的发行版投身于此；我相信更多的用户会乐意加入到 Linux 中来。



Vanilla OS 对软件包管理器的选择

当然，像 Ubuntu MATE 和 Pop!_OS 这样的发行版已经付出了巨大的努力，而 Vanilla OS 也为此增加了一些改进。



这看起来是一种漂亮的体验！😊

一旦你完成了首次设置，你就没有什么可担心的了。你会得到通常的 GNOME 桌面，以及由 Patrik Kramolis 制作的漂亮的壁纸。



接下来，我试着检查了按需不变性，你可以用以下命令查看和调整：



你可以在 GitHub 上了解更多这个（基本上）使之成为可能的工具。

接下来，看看新的软件包管理器，我喜欢 Distrobox 的底层概念，使其与 apx 成为可能。

Distrobox 的创建者 Luca di Maio 也参与了 Vanilla OS 的开发。

不过，当用 apx 安装一个软件包时，你需要用命令来初始化容器：

apx init


如果它能自动完成，那就更直观了。



当然，我不知道技术上的限制。但是，对于用户端来说会感觉更顺滑！

总的来说，一个利用容器安装应用程序的软件包管理器、获得选择你的软件包管理器的能力、按需不变性，以及原味的 GNOME 使它看起来是一个值得关注的好东西。

前面的路：第一印象

我觉得，一旦它进入稳定版，它就会成为我的日常使用系统。

原因是：我总是喜欢原装的 GNOME 体验，而且不需要处理 Fedora 的定期升级。

当然，等我使用了稳定版之后，我可以给你写一篇整体的用户体验评判。

在那之前，我想说这是一个我相信很多用户都会喜欢的项目 👏。

目前，你可以通过加入其 Discord 频道来下载 ISO。该 ISO 还没有公开向所有人提供。如果你感兴趣，可以看看它的 文档。


Vanilla OS


然而，按照路线图，他们计划很快就会有一个候选版本。

I get 0 packets captured, and some number (maybe 1 every 10 seconds) of packets received by filter. ​ What is causing this discrepancy? It seems that the packets are making it to the server's interface, but the application (in this case the UniFi controller/network application server) isn't seeing them, and tcp dump isn't seeing them either? ​ OS is 20.04.4 LTS.

Tier is "Terraform for Stripe" but it goes further and gives you feature flag style access checks, and allows you to count/report usage which can be used for metered billing.
When we started Tier, we knew that there was something interesting in the SaaS pricing and packaging space. Adjusting price is the single most effective lever a business can use to achieve product/market fit, and there's a strong correlation price nimbleness and market success.

It stores your shell history in context (what directory you ran the command it, whether it succeeded or failed, how long it took, etc). This is all stored locally and end-to-end encrypted for syncing to to all your other computers. All of this is easily queryable via Control-R and via the hishtory CLI. This means from your laptop, you can easily find that complex bash pipeline you wrote on your server, and see the context in which you ran it.

 I get a grey-ish screen. Sometimes a spinner flashes up for a moment, and then disappears. The content never loads.
 In the dev console, there are several 403s coming from the CDN.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm developing Hyperstep[0], a spatial language for music production. I find using existing DAWs frustrating because they don't allow me to navigate and operate intuitively on the latent spaces behind my musical ideas. This is why I've decided to build my own set of "seeing tools".(Bret Victor)[1]. I'm also convinced that by framing music as processes and interactions in the 3D world, spatialization and mixing should become fairly pain-free.
I'm still early in development and I would love to build this into an actual product that can be integrated into existing DAWs or even turn it into a musical framework itself for AR and VR experiences.
If you're interested in working on it or if you simply want to know more, feel free to contact me.

It was tough: I didn't know anything about WebAssembly internals and I'm a newbie with Go... so I tried to document it as much as I could for anyone that would like to approach the quest in the future!
It misses a lot of features (that will be gradually implemented).
Any feedback is welcomed!!

There has been a lot of controversy and hype around NFTs, but we’re focused on solving the technical challenges that our customers (software developers working with digital assets) deal with on a day-to-day basis.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you want to know about a certain distro, you go on YouTube to look up some review, and over 90% of the videos you're gonna find are some guy spending like 20 minutes just poking around a freshly-installed system, in some cases not even on the real hardware (as in in Virtual Box). The videos are usually barely edited at all, and the person making it constantly makes mistakes in their claims (e.g. out of all the Feren OS videos I've watched, almost every single one of them claimed that the software center is Gnome's or Ubuntu's, while in reality it's Mint's).
 These videos are absolutely pointless. You're not gonna figure out what the distro is in the first half an hour. If there are any bugs or other issues, they're most likely gonna come out once you start ACTUALLY using it, like installing a bunch of software, extracting archives, watching videos, maybe even gaming, etc. It's usually always something small that's easy to miss. And yet the "reviewer" at the end of the video will always make some kinda conclusion, call it a great OS or even compare it to some other distro.
 I hate this crap. In the midst of all this, nobody makes any ACTUAL reviews, where a person has used the system on their main machine for at least a couple of weeks. And why should they? When these 'First Look' videos (that are also often labeled 'review' btw) collect thousands of views, while actual reviews often struggle to get noticed. Worst of all, the community keeps encouraging these videos. Many prominent Linux youtubers have built their career doing just that. It's very low-effort content that has little to no informational value.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[这篇速成指南诠释了一些步骤，它对于恢复一个 Arch Linux 安装很有帮助。


作为一个滚动发布版本，Arch Linux 有时会崩溃。那不是你自身的问题，而是因为数百个其它的原因，例如一个新内核与你的硬件或软件的兼容性。但是，即使如此，Arch Linux 仍然是比较优秀的，并且提供最新的软件包和应用程序。

但是，有些时候，它会给你带来麻烦，最后你只会看到一个闪烁的光标。

因此，在这种情况下，在你放弃希望前，你可能希望尝试恢复系统的安装以及数据，而不是重新格式化或重新安装。这篇指南在这些方面概述了一些步骤。

恢复 Arch Linux 安装

第一步是创建一个可启动的 Arch Linux 的现场Live USB 。从下面的链接中下载 ISO 镜像文件，并创建一个可启动的 ISO 的启动盘。你可以查看 这篇 关于如何使用 Etcher 创建可启动的 ISO 的启动盘的指南。记住，这一步骤需要在另一个工作稳定的系统上完成，很明显，这是因为你当前系统是不可用的。


下载 arch linux


你需要知道在 你的 Arch Linux 安装在哪个分区上。这是关键的一步。如果你不知道，你可以使用 GParted 来找出来。或者在你的 Grub 菜单中查看，或者也可以运行下面的命令来找出来。这将列出你所有的磁盘分区、大小和标签。

sudo lsblk -o name,mountpoint,label,size,uuid


在完成后，插入 USB 设备，并从中启动。你应该会在现场 USB 启动后看到 Arch Linux 提示符。

现在，使用下面的命令挂载 Arch Linux 分区。将 /dev/sda3 更改为你实际对应的分区。

mount /dev/sda3 /mnt
arch-chroot /mnt

人们设立了自动监听站，它们甚至可以贴在小如蜜蜂的动物身上。这些数字设备的功能就像一个行星规模的助听器：使人类能够观察和研究大自然的声音，超越我们感官能力的极限。这些数据通过 AI 来处理，找到可能帮助我们理解动物之间的对话的模式，现在已经有了鲸鱼的歌声和蜜蜂的舞蹈等数据库。但这也可能带来一个意想不到的滥用：比如将机器人放入蜂巢，欺骗蜜蜂飞到哪里去寻找特定的蜜源，从而对动物进行剥削性使用。


消息来源：VOX



老王点评：AI 确实能做很多好事，但是，如果被滥用也很可怕。你能想象蜜蜂被不断驱使去采蜜直到累死吗？




旧金山举办人工智能艺术展

旧金山的一个名为“人工想象”新的艺术展览展示了艺术家们利用 DALL-E 2、GPT-3 和其他 AI 系统生成的作品。作品包括一系列的作品，从视频到静态图像和雕塑。艺术家和策展人说，这个展览是第一个此类展览，是对人工智能艺术确实是艺术的一个重要认可。一些参加展览的艺术家将当前的时刻比作伴随着照相机到来的类似的手忙脚乱。

老王点评：确实，就像相机的出现不但没有消灭传统艺术，反而成了一种新的艺术门类。




Discord 半年禁止了 5500 万个账户

Discord 最近公布了其季度安全报告，其中指出，在 2022 年 1 月至 6 月期间，约有 5500 万个账户和 68000 个服务器被禁用。其中绝大多数是由于“垃圾信息或与之有关的行为”而被关闭的。只有 1% - 2% 的上诉成功得到了解封。


消息来源：The Gamer



老王点评：虽然 Discord 上充斥着垃圾信息，但是这么大的数量还是令我吃惊。]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[在 Windows 上设置你的路径，这样你就可以使用开源的命令。


当你在操作系统上启动应用程序时，操作系统需要使用某些代码库和实用程序来运行该应用程序。你的操作系统知道如何找到这些库和实用程序，因为它有一个 系统路径，这是一个通往许多应用程序需要的共同共享数据的地图。所有操作系统都有这一点，但用户通常不会意识到这一点，因为他们通常不需要在意它。然而，当你需要编程或使用特殊的网络实用程序或命令时，你可能需要关心你自己的 PATH 变量配置。

PATH 变量使你可以将命令保存到一致的位置，并使用命令提示符或更强大（而开源的）Powershell 从系统上的任何位置调用它们。

例如，假设你想安装开源应用程序 pscp.exe，它是 Windows 上著名的 PuTTY OpenSSH 客户端的命令行界面。你可以将它下载到你的硬盘，但是你的命令行如何知道它的存在呢？其实一开始，它并不知道：

PS> pscp
 pscp: 命令 “pscp” 不能被识别为 cmdlet、脚本文件或可操作程序的名称。
 检查名称的拼写，或者如果包含了路径，则检查路径是否正确，然后再试一次。


如果你正在使用一个开源命令行，例如 Powershell 或 Cmder，那么你将得到一个有用的错误提示，提示这可能是你的路径有问题（或缺少路径）。下面是解决这个问题的方法。

设置 PATH

首先，在桌面上创建一个名为 App 的文件夹。

接下来，右键单击屏幕左下角的 Windows 菜单，然后选择 “系统System”。



在弹出的 “系统System” 窗口中，单击窗口左侧的 “高级系统设置Advanced system settings” 链接。

在出现的 “系统属性System properties” 窗口中，单击窗口底部的 “环境变量Environment variables” 按钮。



在 “环境变量Environment variables” 窗口中，单击 “用户变量User variables” 面板下的 “新建New” 按钮。



在弹出的对话框中，为 “变量名Variable name” 字段输入 PATH，为 “变量值Variable value” 字段输入 %USERPROFILE\Desktop\App 。单击 “确定OK” 按钮保存更改。



在 Desktop/Apps 中放置你想从命令提示符中访问的命令和应用程序，Powershell、Cmder 甚至 Cmd 都能找到它们。

PS> pscp –version
 pscp: Release 0.XY
 Build platform: 64-bit x86 Windows
 PS>


自动设置路径

许多应用程序会在安装过程中自动添加到系统路径中。然而，并不是所有的程序都如此，要么是因为你在安装过程中遗漏了一个复选框，要么是因为应用程序开发人员希望你自己添加它。当自动路径失败时，你现在知道如何自己设置路径。

 I like GNOME with minimal extensions, spend most of my time in the terminal/Text Editor and browser. I run the same chat apps in the background always installed as flatpaks. Steam and proton work on most distros just fine. Lots of services I just replace with Docker/Podman instead, and for everything else, systems is a standard api.
 I don’t care if I have to type apt, zypper, yum, pacman, dnf, etc. I don’t care if the calculator is a snap or a native app. I don’t really even care that the snap daemon is running. I don’t care if there’s an extra line of text in the terminal when I run an apt update
 I’m just using the OS with the workflows that best suit me. None of this other stuff matters at all.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[这里是如何将你当前的 Ubuntu 22.04 LTS Jammy Jellyfish 升级到 Ubuntu 22.10 Kinetic Kudu 的步骤。


始终停留在长期支持的发布版本，这是金科玉律。因为，先前的 Ubuntu 22.04 LTS Jammy Jellyfish 将被支持到 2027 年 4 月。这是一段很长的时间。

此外，LTS 版本超级稳定。它们很少损坏并变得不稳定。因此，如果你在笔记本电脑/台式机电脑或服务器上安装使用 LTS 版本，保持使用它。

然而，如果你想要最新的内核、GNOME 43 和 Pipewire 之类的最新技术 – 你可能会想完成版本跳级，并升级到 Ubuntu 22.10 Kinetic Kudu。

这里是如何做的方法。

升级 Ubuntu 22.04 LTS 到 Ubuntu 22.10

注意：我希望你没有运行去年 10 月份发布的 Ubuntu 21.10 Impish Indri 。因为它已经不被支持。但是鉴于某些原因，你正在运行它，我建议你直接重新安装 22.10 。或者，先升级到 22.04 ，再升级到 22.10 。

在你升级前

在你升级前，做一些内务整理。这是非常重要的。


备份你的 /home、/downloads 和其它的文件到 USB 驱动器或任意独立的分区，以防升级失败。

如果你随着时间的流逝而添加了一些额外的 PPA ，确保将它们记录下来。虽然，在升级过程开始前，升级过程将禁用 PPA 。而在升级完成后，确保手动启用 PPA 。

记录并禁用所有的 GNOME 扩展。如果开发人员没有按照 GNOME 版本进行更新，那么扩展在升级后将会损坏。

家中常备一个现场 USB 磁盘。


升级步骤

打开 “软件包和更新Software & Update” 。

转到 “更新Updates” 标签页。

转到 “通知我新的 Ubuntu 版本Notify me of a new Ubuntu version”，选择并将其更改为 “任意新的版本For any new version”。

这将告诉软件包管理器来查找 Ubuntu 22.10 发布版本的详细信息。



打开一个终端，并运行下面的命令：

sudo apt updatesudo apt upgrade


或者，你也可以打开软件包更新程序。安装所有的准备就绪的软件包。

在两个命令完成后，打开软件包更新。你将会看到一个升级到 Ubuntu 22.10 的提示（如下图所示）。



现在，单击 “升级Upgrade” 按钮，并按照屏幕上的说明进行操作。升级过程需要一些时间，因此，要耐心等待，直至升级完成。确保在整个升级过程中有稳定的互联网链接。

如果你尚未获得更新，请等待一、两天后再次尝试。

如果你没有看到上述提示，手动重新启动一次系统。并再次添加尝试。

通过终端

在终端中通过 nano 文件编辑器打开下面的文件。

nano /etc/update-manager/release-upgrades


将 Prompt=LTS 更改为 Prompt=normal 。注意：如果你已经如上所述将更新标签页更改为 “任意新的版本For any new version” ，那么这个文件应该已经更新了。但是，要验证它一次。



分别按下组合键 CTRL+O 和组合键 CTRL+X 来保存和退出。

最后，你也可以运行下面的命令来从终端中强制升级过程。

sudo do-release-upgrade -c




升级过程需要花费一些时间（最少半个小时，上不封顶），这主要取决于你的互联网连接和硬件。直至等到其完成。在完成后，重新启动并享受 Ubuntu 22.10 Kinetic Kudu.



在升级过程进行时，看看我们 不久前发布的关于 Ubuntu 22.10 的精彩文章。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Systemd version 252 has been released.  As usual, the list of changes is
long.  It includes a new systemd-measure tool for the calculation of PCR
values and a bunch of infrastructure to use the result for disk encryption:


	Net effect: if you boot a properly prepared kernel, TPM-bound disk
        encryption now defaults to be locked to kernels which carry PCR
          signatures from the same key pair. Example: if a hypothetical distro
          FooOS prepares its UKIs like this, TPM-based disk encryption is now –
          by default – bound to only FooOS kernels, and encrypted volumes bound
          to the TPM cannot be unlocked on kernels from other sources.


There's a lot more; see the announcement for all of the details.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Linux security module (LSM) mechanism was created as a result of the first Kernel Summit in 2001; it was
designed to allow the development of multiple approaches to Linux security.
That goal has been met; there are several security modules available with
current kernels.  The LSM subsystem was not designed, though, to allow
multiple security modules to work together on the same system.  Developers
have been working to rectify that problem almost since the LSM subsystem
was merged, but with limited success; some small security modules can be
stacked on top of the "major" ones, but arbitrary stacking is not possible.
Now, a full 20 years after
security-module support went into the 2.5 development kernel series, it
looks like a solution to the stacking problem may finally be getting
closer.]]></summary>

So I ask: do you have a procedure in place to grant or transfer access in case of death?
My first idea would be using a password manager for everything, list every device used for 2SA and confine within my will a master password.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Wikipedia has an entire page criticizing Linux, collecting information given by the developers of the Kernel and even Linus himself. However, the sources of these information seem to be a bit old (most of them are from around 2000-2012).
 Most of these issues will definitely be resolved as time goes on, such as bad hardware support and lower game market-share. Other points aren't actually issues, but rather depend on how you consider them; such as distribution fragmentation. However, the most concerning point of that article is the following:
  
In an interview with German newspaper Zeit Online in November 2011, Linus Torvalds stated that Linux has become "too complex" and he was concerned that developers would not be able to find their way through the software anymore. He complained that even subsystems have become very complex and he told the publication that he is "afraid of the day" when there will be an error that "cannot be evaluated anymore."
  
and:
  
Q: Is it your opinion that the quality of the kernel is in decline? Most developers seem to be pretty sanguine about the overall quality problem. Assuming there's a difference of opinion here, where do you think it comes from? How can we resolve it? 
 A: I used to think [code quality] was in decline, and I think that I might think that it still is. I see so many regressions which we never fix.
  
In other points of the article, it was said that Linus considers the kernel to be bloated.
 I'm wondering, will something be done to fix this issue that even Linus considers concerning? I really love Linux but these issues hinder my ability to sleep at night.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[据第一财经，日前有市场传闻称，以中信为首的财团正在接洽腾讯南非大股东，拟全额收购其手中的腾讯股票，拿下腾讯控股权。


此前腾讯发布财报显示，腾讯控股今年上半年收入2695.05亿元，同比下滑1%；净利润420.32亿元，同比重挫53%。而根据腾讯2022年中期报告，其第一大股东MIH TC由南非报业集团Naspers全资子公司Prosus所控制。经过多轮减持，南非报业集团Naspers对腾讯持股比例已经从最初的46%降至当前的27.99%。腾讯股价在2022年以来大跌，不过，若要收购其大股东手中的股票，中信仍要支出大约5000多亿港元。


面对Naspers持续不断的减持，目前腾讯公司一直在出资回购，并且已经耗资一千多亿港元来承接Naspers的巨大抛盘，但如果要让腾讯继续掏钱回购剩下的6000亿港元股权，确实也有很大的难度。南非大股东持有腾讯28%股份，约合700亿美元，一家财团拿下可能有点困难，但是要是几家国资共同发起收购也不是不可能。

我喜欢 Linux 桌面这件事对任何读过我作品的人来说都不会感到惊讶。我的意思是，我曾经是一个早已消失的出版物《Linux 桌面》的主要作者和编辑。那么，为什么我在底特律召开的 Kubecon 北美峰会上，在我的惠普 Chromebook x360 上写这篇文章呢？

很简单，因为 Chrome OS 是一个 Linux 发行版。以前是，以后也是。

而这让一些 Linux 粉丝很恼火。他们对 Linux 桌面未来的设想是让每个人都“运行 Ubuntu，不是 Fedora 或 Arch Linux！”，“拜托，Linux Mint 才是赢家”，“MX Linux”，“现实点吧！使用 openSUSE Tumbleweed！” 等等，不一而足。有 上千种 Linux 发行版，这就是我们永远不会看到他们的 “Linux 桌面消灭 Windows” 的梦想实现的一个重要原因。

但 Chromebook 不同。当然，Chromebook 的销售已经 崩溃 了，但部分原因是 Chromebook 太皮实耐用了。与 Windows 机器不同的是，Windows 机器的寿命大概是三年，而我有的 Chromebook 已经运行了七年了。

的确，它们的 自动更新到期（AUE）日期 已经成为过去了，所以我不能再获得自动更新。但是，那又怎样？甚至谷歌也 承认 你可以在它们的平均五年到期日期之后继续使用它们。

而如果是 Windows，那就不一样了。任何仍在运行 Windows 7 的人都是邀请黑客来黑他，除非他们购买了 扩展安全更新（ESU）合同。而且，即使是这样，ESU 也将在 2023 年 1 月结束。

然而，Chrome OS 呢？与每个月都有重大安全补丁的 Windows 不同，Chrome OS 的严…]]></summary>

 I'm not sure if it's allowed to post links to webshops. I can post it if you want to see for yourself.
 Edit: Thanks for all your comments. I just noticed that the site has some links on the bottom of every page that explain what Linux is and give proper credit, so I guess everything is above board.

昨天我们 报道 过，谷歌准备在 Chrome 110 中废弃 JPEG-XL 的实验性支持。对此，谷歌的一位工程师给出了他们的理由：实验性标志和代码不应该无限期地保留下去；整个生态系统没有足够的兴趣继续实验；新的图像格式并没有带来足够的增量优势；减少维护负担。而事实上，JPEG-XL d 比特流在 2020 年底才被冻结，文件格式在去年才被标准化，编码系统在今年早些时候才被标准化。

国外网友发现他的猫在“使用”百度

一位国外网友给自己的猫买了一个自动喂食器，但是他发现这个喂食器每隔五分钟就会解析一下 baidu.com 的域名。经过研究，原来这个带有摄像头、WiFi 功能和云端服务的物联网设备，会通过解析 baidu.com 来判断网络联通性。而这是硬编码到其设备代码中的，并且使用了过期的解析库。至于为什么会解析百度而不是谷歌，显然这是一台中国生产的物联网设备。

	So while rc2 was just _way_ bigger than usual, rc3 is only a bit

	largish side. I hope that things start calming down, and we'll
	start seeing the size of these rc's shrink. Please?]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi everyone, We’re building an open-source identity and risk management platform and we’ve just released the first chunk of code, a fully customizable KYC flow & UI, to the public.
We’ve chosen to use Svelte so our flows would be lightweight (it is ~50kb gzipped).
Next up:
- Adding forms and components for it to be used as a full onboarding flow.
- Releasing an open-source case management dashboard, for manual approval of users.
- Releasing an open-source rule engine, to help automate decisions.
We’d love to hear your feedback, suggestions, or any question you’ve got.
And if the rest of the project is relevant or interesting to you, follow us and, we’ll update you once new things are available.
Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Based on the kernel source code zswap is a backend for frontswap. Frontswap provides a “transcendent memory” interface for swap pages. In some cases we can get increased performance by saving swapped pages in RAM (or a RAM-like device) and not on disk as swap partition\swapfile (https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/v4.18/vm/frontswap.html). The frontends are usually implemented in the kernel while the backend is implemented as a kernel module (as we will show soon). Zswap takes pages that are in the process of being swapped out and attempts to compress and store them in a RAM-based memory pool. (https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/latest/source/mm/zswap.c).
 We can say that zswap trades CPU cycles for potentially reduced swap I/O. A significant performance improvement can happen in case the reads from the swap device are much slower than the reads from the compressed cache (https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/v4.18/vm/zswap.html). The “zswap_frontswap_store” is the function that attempts to compress and store a single page (https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v6.1-rc2/source/mm/zswap.c#L1097).
 The kernel thread “zswap-shrink” is created created based on a workqueue (https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v6.1-rc2/source/mm/zswap.c#L1511). On my VM (Ubuntu 22.04.1) zswap is compiled part of the kernel itself and not as a separate “*.ko” (kernel module). You can see in the screenshot below that it does not appear in the output of “lsmod” and is marked as builtin (look at the filename field) in the output of “modinfo”.
 For more information like the compression used by zswap (the default one is lzo) and other parameters that can be configured for zswap I suggest reading the following link https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/zswap. You can also read the parameters on “/sys/module/zswap/parameters”

JPEG-XL 作为一种免版税的下一代有损/无损图像格式，其性能比 JPEG 好得多，因此被人们所看好。JPEG-XL 部分是基于谷歌的 PIK 提案，该文件格式在去年才被标准化。自 Chrome 91 以来，谷歌浏览器通过一个功能标志启用 JPEG-XL 支持，但谷歌正在考虑在 Chrome 110 中废除对该图像的支持。目前还没有公开的评论，说明他们放弃 JPEG-XL 的理由，但是谷歌方面一直在积极推广他们的 WebP 格式。

老王点评：看来还是谷歌觉得 JPEG-XL 不够亲儿子。




VMware 为过期版本修补了一个高危漏洞

VMware 修补了一个影响其 VMware Cloud Foundation 和 NSX Manager 产品的高危漏洞，该漏洞允许未经授权的黑客以最高的系统权限执行恶意代码。该漏洞危险等级 9.8/10，存在于其所依赖的 XStream 开源库中，因为危险是如此之高，VMware 不同寻常的为不再支持的版本发布了补丁。


消息来源：Solidot



老王点评：还不错，还会为停止支持的过期产品提供安全补丁。




FreeBSD 再次引入 WireGuard

早在 2020 年，FreeBSD 就引入了 WireGuard，但后来发现其初始实现代码太烂，而在 FreeBSD 13 RC 期间被移除。后来，WireGuard 的上游开发者亲自出手参与了其在 FreeBSD 的实现，经过两年的精细打磨，终于在周五重新进入了 FreeBSD 内核。预计它将出现在 FreeBSD 14 中，之前版本的 FreeBSD 也将会向后移植。


消息来源：Phoronix



老王点评：为 FreeBSD 的精益求精点赞。]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[GNOME 有了一个全新的文本编辑器，以取代旧的 Gedit 编辑器。

虽然 GNOME 42 已经可以使用了它，但 Ubuntu 22.04 还依赖于 Gedit。

这在 Ubuntu 22.10 中发生了变化。 GNOME 文本编辑器Text Editor 现在是默认程序，甚至没有安装 Gedit。



虽然新编辑器足够好，但并不是每个人都喜欢它。如果你将 Gedit 与其他插件一起频繁使用，则尤其如此。

如果你属于这类人，让我向你展示如何在 Ubuntu 上安装 Gedit。我还将分享如何将其设为默认文本编辑器。

在 Ubuntu 上安装 Gedit

这实际上是不费吹灰之力的。虽然默认未安装 Gedit，但它仍然可以在 Ubuntu 仓库中找到。

所以，你所要做的就是使用 apt 命令来安装它：

sudo apt install gedit


Gedit 也可以在软件中心中找到，但它是 Snap 包。如果你愿意，你可以安装它。



安装 Gedit 插件（可选）

默认情况下，Gedit 为你提供访问一些插件的选项。你可以从 “汉堡菜单->偏好Preference->插件Plugins” 启用或禁用插件。



你可以在这里看到可用的插件。检查已安装或正在使用的插件。



但是，你可以通过安装 gedit-plugins 元数据包将插件选择提升到一个新的水平。

sudo apt install gedit-plugins


这将使你可以访问其他插件，如书签、括号补全、Python 控制台等。



提示：如果你发现 Gedit 因缺少底角而显得有些格格不入，你可以安装一个名为 Round Bottom Corner 的 GNOME 扩展。这将为包括 Gedit 在内的所有应用强制添加圆底角。

使 Gedit 成为默认文本编辑器

好了！你已经安装了 Gedit，但文本文件仍然在双击操作后使用 GNOME 文本编辑器打开。要使用 Gedit 打开文件，你需要右键单击，然后选择“打开方式open with”选项。

如果你希望一直使用 Gedit 打开文本文件，你可以将其设置为默认程序。

右键单击文本文件并选择“打开方式open with”选项。在此处选择 Gedit 并从底部启用“始终用于此文件类型Always use for this file type”选项。



删除 Gedit

觉得 Gedit 没达到预期么？这很少见，但我不会评判你。要从 Ubuntu 中删除 Gedit，请使用以下命令：

sudo apt remove gedit


你也可以尝试从软件中心卸载它。

总结

GNOME 文本编辑器是下一代从头开始创建的编辑器，它与新的 GNOME 完美融合。

对于简单的文本编辑来说已经足够了。然而，Gedit 有一个插件生态系统，赋予它更多功能。

对于那些将它广泛用于编码和其他事情的人来说，安装 Gedit 仍然是 Ubuntu 中的一个选项。

那你呢？你会坚持使用默认的新文本编辑器还是回到旧的 Gedit？

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[组织层面的自动化一直是一个难以实现的目标，但 Kubernetes 或许能够改变这一切。


当我在 2002 年采用 Gentoo Linux 作为我的主要操作系统时，我开始了我的自动化之旅。二十年后，自动化还没有完成。当我与客户和合作伙伴会面时，他们分享了团队内部的自动化成果，但他们也描述了在组织层面实现类似成功所面临的挑战。

大多数 IT 组织都能够端到端地提供虚拟机，从而将过去 4 周的交付周期缩短到仅 5 分钟。这种级别的自动化本身就是一个复杂的工作流程，需要网络（IP 地址管理、DNS、代理、网络区域等）、身份访问管理、虚拟机管理程序、存储、备份、更新操作系统、应用最新的配置文件、监控、安全和强化以及合规性基准测试，等等。哇，这么多！

满足高速、可扩展和按需自动化的业务需求并不容易。例如，来看看经典的网上商店或提交纳税申报表的在线政府服务，其工作负载有明确的峰值需要面对。

处理此类负载的一种常见方法是拥有一个超大的服务器集群，以供 IT 专业人员的特定团队使用，监控客户或公民的季节性涌入。每个人都希望及时部署整个栈。他们希望基础架构在混合云场景的上下文中运行工作负载，使用“构建-消耗-回收build-consume-trash”模型来优化成本，同时从无限弹性中受益。

换句话说，每个人都想要乌托邦式的“云体验”。

云真的能交付吗？

尚有一线机会，这主要归功于 Kubernetes 的设计方式。Kubernetes 的指数级普及推动了创新，取代了管理平台和应用的标准传统做法。 Kubernetes 需要使用 “万物皆代码Everything-as-Code”（EaC）来定义从简单的计算节点到 TLS 证书的所有资源的期望状态。Kubernetes 强制使用三种主要的设计结构：


一个标准接口，以减少内部和外部组件之间的整合问题

API 优先及仅 API 的方法来标准化其所有组件的 CRUD（创建、读取、更新、删除）操作

使用 YAML 作为通用语言，以简单易读的方式定义这些组件的所有所需状态


这三个关键组成部分基本上是选择自动化平台的相同要求，至少如果你想让跨职能团队轻松采用是这样的。这也模糊了团队之间的职责分工，有助于提高跨越孤岛的协作，这是一件好事！

事实上，采用 Kubernetes 的客户和合作伙伴正在加速进入超自动化状态。Kubernetes 有机地推动团队采用多种 DevOps 基础和实践，如：EaC、使用 Git 进行版本控制、同行评审、文档即代码Documentation as Code，并鼓励跨职能协作。这些实践有助于提高团队的自动化技能，并帮助团队在处理应用生命周期和基础架构的 GitOps 和 CI/CD 管道方面取得良好的开端。

让自动化成为现实

你没看错！网络商店或政府报告等复杂系统的整个栈可以用清晰、可理解、通用的术语定义，可以在任何本地或云提供商上执行。可以定义具有自定义指标的自动伸缩器以触发所需栈的即时部署，以解决季节性高峰期间客户或市民的涌入问题。当指标恢复正常，且云计算资源不再有存在的理由时，你将它们回收并恢复常规运营，而由一组核心资产在本地接管业务，直到下一次激增。

鸡和蛋的悖论

考虑到 Kubernetes 和云原生模式，自动化是必须的。但它提出了一个重要的问题：一个组织可以在解决自动化战略之前采用 Kubernetes 吗？

似乎从 Kubernetes 开始可以激发更好的自动化，但这并不是一个一成不变的结论。工具不是对技能、实践和文化问题的解决方案。但是，设计良好的平台可以成为 IT 组织内学习、变革和跨职能协作的催化剂。

开始使用 Kubernetes

即使你觉得自己错过了自动化列车，也不要害怕从简单、不复杂的栈上开始使用 Kubernetes。当你 掌握了初始步骤，就可以拥抱这个出色的编排系统的简单性，并根据更复杂的需求进行迭代。

Rhino Linux 将成为 Rolling Rhino Remix 的继任者。这个由 http.llamaz 构建的 Linux 发行版，提供了滚动发布的非官方的 Ubuntu 变体版本。

需要澄清的是，该项目从未旨在取代其他稳定的发行版，而纯粹是一个充满乐趣的激情项目。

而随着人们开始将其用作日常使用并对其期望更多，开发人员决定将其变成一个严肃的项目。

Rhino Linux 作为它的继任者。那么，你对它的期待是什么？

有请继任者 Rhino Linux

其主要目标是提供稳定的 Ubuntu 体验，同时仍提供滚动发布模式。

目标仍保持不变，但 Rhino Linux 的基础将得到彻底改变。他们有可能使它成为一个令人印象深刻的滚动发布的 Ubuntu 发行版。

听起来很令人兴奋！🤯

在其核心，Rhino Linux 将使用稍微修改过的 Xfce 版本作为其桌面环境；之所以选择它是因为它众所周知的稳定性和速度。

Rhino Linux 的创始人提到了以下几点：


滚动版 Ubuntu 仍然是我们的核心理念。Rhino Linux 并不是从 Rolling Rhino Remix 中分离出来的，而是将它重新设想为更稳定、更成熟的发行版，它原本就应该以这种方式出厂。




除此之外，Pacstall 将用作 Rhino Linux 上的默认包管理器及其存储库之一。


💡 Pacstall 是一个受 AUR 启发的 Ubuntu 包管理器。


Pacstall 的开发由其创始人 Plasma 领导。他还作为新开发人员之一（副项目负责人）加入，而 Sourajyoti Basak 作为另一位核心成员加入。

前进：可用性和发布

在撰写本文时，Rhino Linux 尚未确定任何具体的发布日期，但你可以预计它会在 2023 年的某个时间发布。

Rolling Rhino Remix 会发生什么？

开发者澄清说，它将在 Rhino Linux 发布后继续维护三个月。但是，在 2022 年 1 月 11 日后继发布之后，它没有新的发布镜像。

你可以通过访问其 官方网站 了解更多关于 Rhino Linux 的信息。

💬 你觉得 Rhino Linux 怎么样？它可以成为值得尝试的官方 Ubuntu 风格的竞争者吗？

 I am a regular ubuntu user who is a bit familiar with the Linux terminal. I find myself a lot comfortable using Linux.
 The question is I don't know if my laptop can handle the new ubuntu release without causing any issues with the hardware.
 I once used fedora on a HP laptop, and it started powering off randomly and I think it is the AMD graphics card as maybe it got damaged.
 I am a bit traumatized with what had happened, and I am afraid of this happening again with my new device so would you give me any advice please!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[According to Wikipedia, Apple's iOS and MacOS are closed-source with open-source components.
 What does that mean though? According to what I know of the GPL license, when you distribute a product with open-source components, you have to either license the product under the GPL or pay royalties to the owners of the open-source components.
 There was a case some years ago when a China-based company created a product and rebranded a open-source music playing application as their own. The open-source developers sued, it went to court and the judge upheld the GPL and the China-based company removed all open-sourced components from their product and created their own music player in order to avoid paying royalties to original owners of the code.
 So, is that what Apple is doing then? Paying royalties to open-source developers for every iPhone or Mac sold?

 So far I'm testing against some ANSI Art and output of the script command where I call: dialog, top, vi, and to be complete I just run emacs -nw.
 Do you have any ideas for any other commands that I can test? This needs to produce single output but can be interactive (because I use script command).
 I was also cmatrix but I needed to tweak the file because it was clearing the screen before exit. But it's not good because It's hard to say if the output is correct or not.

从现在起，广泛使用的 Adobe 应用程序，如 Photoshop、Illustrator 和 InDesign 将不再免费支持 Pantone 公司的颜色，那些希望在他们的文件中使用这些颜色的人将需要支付一个单独的许可证。你需要使用一个每月 15 美元的插件才能使用这些颜色。

为修复高危漏洞，Fedora 37 推迟发布

Fedora Linux 37 的发布日期从原计划的 10 月底推迟到 11 月 15 日，原因是为了修复一个 OpenSSL 高危漏洞。OpenSSL 计划在 11 月 1 日释出修复漏洞的补丁，因此关于该漏洞的细节尚未公开。安全社区的一种通常做法是在补丁做好准备前对相关信息保密，以防止其被利用。由于 Fedora 是公开构建的，所以不能在漏洞披露前就先打好补丁。但有趣的是，即使发布延迟，但是定于 11 月 4-5 日的 Fedora Linux 37 发布派对会照常举行。


消息来源：Fedora Magazine



老王点评：开源项目的开放性往往都是好的，但是在这个情况下，却是一个弱点。




Linux 6.2 主线内核将支持苹果 M1 系列芯片

本周，苹果 M1 Pro、Max 和 Ultra SoC 的设备树排队进入 Linux 内核 SoC 的 for-next 分支。也就是说，对 M1 系列芯片的支持进入了上游，而且使用这些 SoC 的 Mac Studio 也将得到支持。最终，基于 Arm 的苹果芯片将在 Linux 上得到很好的开箱即用的支持，而不仅仅是 Asahi Linux 发行版。


消息来源：Phoronix



老王点评：虽然苹果不主动支持，但是 Linux 内核社区还是非常有积极性。]]></summary>

 Finally at the end of 2010 I've moved to a company where they forced everybody to move to Linux (great!!!), and these last 12 years I didn't touch a Windows computer, except some servers, in and outside my working time.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[马上就到万圣节了，太棒啦！

我相信你已经有了一些庆祝万圣节的想法。给你的 Linux 桌面做一个像幽灵般的黑暗改造，就类似于下面的屏幕截图，你觉得怎么样？



可定制是 Linux 的一大优势，对 Linux 可进行的定制是多种多样且没有尽头的。之前，我们向你展示过 如何让你的 Linux 看起来像 macOS 的方法。今天，我将继续分享一些定制“万圣节”Linux 桌面的技巧。

可以通过主题、图标、扩展、字体、Conky 等一系列配置组合起来，来实现 Linux 桌面的定制。虽然，你可以在任何的 Linux 发行版和桌面环境中配置这些东西，但是仅在一个教程中展示所有 Linux 发行版和桌面环境的桌面定制方法，是不太可行的。

因此，在本文中，我将介绍 Ubuntu 与 GNOME 桌面环境的桌面定制方法。

安装所需工具

你需要一些软件包和工具。在开始定制桌面前，请确保你安装了全部（或大多数）的软件包和工具。

你不必做所有这些桌面改变。但你做的越多，你的桌面也会美化得更好看。

安装 GNOME 优化工具和 GMOME 扩展管理器

使用以下命令，来安装 GNOME 优化Tweaks 工具和 GMOME 扩展管理器（Extensions manager）：

sudo apt install gnome-tweaks gnome-extension-manager


在基于 KDE 的 Linux 系统中，没有可以更改 Linux 桌面外观的优化工具。但是，你可以使用 Kvantum-Manager 这一应用程序来更改外观，请参考我在 KDE 主题指南 中的讨论。

安装 Conky（可选）

你可以选择是否要安装 Conky ，因为现在 conky-manager 项目已经不再维护了，因此继续使用 Conky 可能会有点棘手。…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[你想了解 Base64 编码和解码的方法吗？在本教程中，我们使用 Bash shell 脚本和各种示例解释了 Base64 编码和解码步骤。




Base64 编码方法可以将二进制数据转换为文本，如此编码数据可以在任何通信媒介进行传输。这种编码方法主要用于电子邮件加密的过程。

总体而言，Base64 编码方法是一种二进制到文本的编码方案，以 ASCII 字符串格式表示 8 字节的二进制数据。使用这种编码方法在各种媒介之间传输数据时有几个优势，尤其是对于那些能可靠地支持文本内容的媒介。因此，Base64 编码方法在万维网上被广泛使用。这种编码方案最常用于电子邮件附件的编码上。

根据 Base64 编码表，二进制数据可以经 Base64 编码后可以转换为 64 个不同的 ASCII 字符，包含大写字母 A 到 Z，小写字母 a 到 z，数字 0 到 9，以及符号 + 和 /，这些字符在传输和打印上十分便捷。

这 64 个 ASCII 字符代表着从 000000 到 111111 的二进制值。每个非末尾的 Base64 编码字符恰好代表 6 位二进制值。



Bash base64 的编码和解码

句法

在我们提供示例之前，首先介绍 Base64 的基本语法。

base64 [OPTIONs] [INFILE] [OUTFILE]



选项（Option）：参照下面的表格，你可以提供任何的选项或组合多个选项。

输入（INFILE）：你可以从标准输入（如命令行）或文件中输入。

输出（OUTFILE）：你可以将输出重定向到标准输出，如终端或文件中。





选项
描述




-e 或者 --encode
此选项用于对标准输入的数据或从文件中读入的数据进行编码。这是默认选项。


-d 或者 --d…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Xubuntu 22.10 提供了精致的 Xfce 体验。请读此文了解详情。




Xubuntu 是基于 Xfce 的 Ubuntu 官方版本。

它也是最好的轻量级 Linux 发行版之一。

随着最新的 Xubuntu 22.10 “Kinetic Kudu” 版本，你可以看到改进的桌面环境、添加的功能，以及全面的细化。

Xubuntu 22.10 的新变化



Xubuntu 22.10 带来了一些令人兴奋的升级。一些亮点包括：


Xfce 4.16（或 Xfce 4.17 开发版）

Catfish 的外观进行了更新。

更新了新图标，弃用了 elementary-xfce-darker 主题。

Mousepad 搜索历史。

Thundar 文件管理器的改进。

Xfce 任务管理器。



💡 Xubuntu 22.10 将支持九个月，直到 2023 年 7 月。如果你想要稳定性而不是功能，你应该首选使用 LTS 版本。


Xfce 4.17 开发版还是 Xfce 4.16？

Xubuntu 22.10 的发行说明说它专门提供了 Xfce 4.17 开发版本。

但是，当我安装 Xubuntu 22.10 的 beta 版本（并将其更新到最新版本）时，只具有 Xfce 4.16。



不确定他们是否退出了 Xfce 4.17 开发版本，或者 Xfce 4.16 现在是否存在。

Catfish 外观



Catfish 是 Xubuntu 上的一个文件搜索工具。通过新的升级，它具有焕然一新的外观，并做了底层的改进。

与你搜索的文件交互时，你还会获得一个“打开方式”上下文菜单。



Catfish 还添加了一些细微而有用的功能。

GNOME 43 软件应用

在值得注意的应用程序更新中，GNOME 的最新软件中心是一个不错的选择。这是 Xubuntu 22.10 的外观：



当然，它可能无法与 Xfce 上的其他应用程序保持一致，但我认为你应该不会介意。

图标更新

随着 elementary-xfce 0.17 图标更新，有许多新图标和更简洁的选项，可提供一致的 Xubuntu 桌面体验。



此外，elementary-xfce-darkest 主题图标包已被弃用。



任务管理器右键选项



你现在可以将完整的进程路径复制到剪贴板。这对于需要从命令行进行故障排除或停止操作很有用。

其他增强功能



还有其他几个值得注意的变化，包括：


Linux 内核 5.19。

Firefox 浏览器 105。

Alt-Tab 视图通过更突出的图标进行了改进。

马赛克拼图添加到 SGT 拼图系列。

Mousepad 文本编辑器现在包括搜索历史记录，以及更多调整。


要了解有关更改的更多信息，请查看 官方发行说明。

下载 Xubuntu 22.10

你可以从 Ubuntu 的中央镜像库 或它的 官方网站 下载最新的 ISO 文件。

官方网站可能需要一段时间才能提供 ISO。


下载Xubuntu 22.10


💬 你觉得 Xubuntu 22.10 如何？请在评论中告诉我。

我们的消费交易是一个从需求开始、通过账户流出、产生交易并得到商品的过程，记账就是对这个过程进行记录、整理和归档。如果把这个过程映射在记账行为中，就是一个在预算的基础上、通过账户和类别的输入、到消费交易的处理流程，最后，在期末用报表的形式进行输出，这就构成了一个完整的记账系统，它也是你在学习记账中的重要的逻辑基础。

想要真正地学会记账，就必须搭建一个包含这 4 种元素的记账系统，我把这 4 个元素模块化，分别分成：1. 输入，2. 处理，3. 输出，0. 预算。
在这一章中，我主要从理论出发，把记账系统按照输入、处理、输出和预算划分为了 4 个模块，在你使用任何一个记账 App 的时候，从这 4 个模块出发能帮你更有逻辑地从全局上认识这个 App。

I reinstalled the system and tried different solutions on youtube But same problem 
 So I tried another distro and give linux another chance I installed the distro which was garuda Linux and it's was so goddamn slow the animations were laggy I tried to install some software but it's was giving me error codes But the nvidia drivers were installed by default this time so That's a good thing i guess 
 This was my experience So i came back on using my compatible fast windows -_- Where at least i don't have to rely on terminal for literally everything

that the long-awaited generic associated types feature will be stable in Rust 1.65.


	At its core, generic associated types allow you to have generics
	(type, lifetime, or const) on associated types. Note that this is
	really just rounding out the places where you can put generics: for
	example, you can already have generics on freestanding type aliases
	and on functions in traits. Now you can just have generics on type
	aliases in traits (which we just call associated types).]]></summary>

I started messing around with a way to verify the checksum of scripts before I execute them. I've found it a really useful tool for installing things like Rust or Deno.
It's written entirely as a shell script, and it's easy to read and understand what's happening.
I hope it may be useful to someone else!

most software of interest was written in C; as a result, distributions
are naturally able to efficiently package C applications and the libraries
they depend on.  Modern languages, though, tend to be built around their
own package-management systems that are designed with different goals in
mind.  The result is that, for years, distributors have struggled to find
the best ways to package and ship applications written in those languages.
A recent discussion in the Fedora community on the packaging of Rust
applications shows that the problems have not yet all been solved.]]></summary>

周四，经过几个月的法律纠纷后，埃隆·马斯克捧着一个水槽进入了推特总部大楼。除了原 CEO、CFO 之外，总法律顾问、首席客户官等高管也被辞退，有消息称，有的高管是被保安带出去的。不过，这些高管都是拿着巨额补偿走的。马斯克曾谈到利用推特创建一个类似微信的超级应用 “X 应用”。

谷歌推出以太坊节点云服务

谷歌云区块链节点引擎将是一个“完全管理的节点托管服务，可以最大限度地减少对节点操作的需求”，这意味着谷歌云将负责监控节点活动，并在停机后重新启动它们。谷歌的宣布标志着技术巨头对区块链和 Web3 项目给予了越来越多的关注。


消息来源：谷歌



老王点评：这对于区块链的发展是件好事。




苹果公司在开发者的强烈抗议下暂停了应用商店的赌博广告

周二，苹果公司宣布在其应用商店中投放更多的广告，这包括在应用程序的页面上宣传其它应用程序。开发者发现在他们的应用程序下有很多不当的广告，比如一个老虎机应用被放在赌博成瘾康复应用旁边做广告，还有一些例子是其他博彩应用被放在针对儿童的应用页面上做广告，成人视频聊天应用出现在苹果图书页面，约会应用被放在旨在改善现有关系的应用下面。在受到大量批评之后，苹果已经“暂停了应用商店产品页面上与赌博和其他一些类别有关的广告”。


消息来源：The Verge



老王点评：看来苹果在广告投放方面还需要学习一下。]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[据美国《华盛顿邮报》援引消息人士称，当地时间27日晚，特斯拉CEO马斯克以440亿美元收购推特交易已完成，他已获得该公司控制权。据彭博，根据纽约证券交易所的退市通知，推特将于当地时间10月28日从纽约证券交易所退市。当地时间10月27日，马斯克完成了440亿美元将推特私有化的交易，并已掌管该公司。


据报道，3位要求匿名的知情人士透露，推特首席执行官Parag Agrawal、首席财务官Ned Segal、法律总顾问Sean Edgett等4名高管已被马斯克解雇，被匆匆赶出推特总部大楼。


此举表明马斯克打算将自己的印记打入这家世界上颇具影响力的社交媒体公司。


据《华盛顿邮报》此前援引知情人士和一份文件报道称，马斯克计划在未来几个月内将推特的7500名员工人数减少到2000多人。但后来遭到马斯克否认，称他不会裁员75%。


马斯克26日在推特上公布了一段自己抱着一个洗手水槽进入推特总部的视频，暗示收购推特已经定局。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[这是你在 Linux 终端中安装和玩经典贪吃蛇的方法。


还记得老式手机经典简单的贪吃蛇吗？我记得玩了几个小时。嘿，当时没有其他选择，对吧？智能手机仍未上市。而你所拥有的只有这个。



但随着时间的推移，贪吃蛇被具有各种选项的更高级的图形游戏所取代。但没有什么能比得上经典贪吃蛇游戏。

如果我告诉你，你可以在 Linux 终端中玩这个游戏呢？无论你运行的是 Ubuntu Linux、Fedora Linux 还是 Arch Linux，都无关紧要。该游戏适用于大多数 发行版。



安装 nSnake – Linux 终端的贪吃蛇

你可以使用以下方法通过终端安装 此游戏。

对于 Ubuntu、Linux Mint 或其他相关发行版：

sudo apt install nsnake


对于 Fedora Linux 和其他：

sudo dnf install nsnake


对于 Arch Linux，此游戏可在 Arch 用户仓库（AUR） 中获得。你可以使用以下步骤安装它。


设置 Yay AUR 助手

然后打开终端并运行以下命令


yay -S nsnake


上面的命令会安装游戏的软件仓库版本，它可能不是最新的。但是，如果你想要最新版本，你可能需要通过 GitHub 编译源代码。我在本页末尾添加了编译说明供你参考。

玩游戏

玩游戏非常简单。在终端中输入 nsnake，这将启动游戏。

要立即退出，请按 q。

以下是默认键绑定。


箭头键 - 移动蛇

q – 退出游戏

p – 暂停游戏


你还可以通过主菜单以各种方式配置游戏。



完成了，玩吧！

编译

要编译最新版本，请在所有 Linux 发行版中使用以下命令。

哦，确保你已经安装了 git 和 ncurses-devel，它们是编译所需的包。

git clone https://github.com/alexdantas/nSnake.gitcd nsnakemakemake install


那么，你喜欢贪吃蛇游戏吗？与其他基于终端的游戏相比，你更喜欢它吗？在下面的评论框中与其他读者分享你的观点。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[以下是我们安装 Ubuntu 22.10 “Kinetic Kudu”（GNOME 版）后，推荐做的 10 件事列表。




Ubuntu 22.10 带来了很多令人兴奋的新功能，例如 GNOME 43、最新的内核、重新设计的托盘菜单、文件应用的功能和 Pipewire 等 新功能。

我相信你已经迫不及待地想尝试 Ubuntu 22.10 上的这些新功能了。

但是请先等一等。

在你前往享受你新安装的 Ubuntu 22.10 之前，我要向你推荐一个不容错过的 Ubuntu 定制技巧列表。

安装 Ubuntu 22.10 后要做的 10 件事

1、更新你的系统

安装好 Ubuntu 22.10 后，第一件要做的事就是更新你的系统。因为时差的原因，最新的 ISO 镜像通常不会包括所有的系统更新。所以，你要打开一个终端窗口，并运行以下命令，来更新你的系统。

sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade


上述命令执行完成后，你就可以进行下一步啦。

2、删除 Firefox Snap，并安装 Flatpak 或者 deb 版本的 Firefox

自去年发布的 Ubuntu 21.10 版本以来，默认的网页浏览器 Firefox 开始以 Snap 软件包的形式出现。如果你是普通用户，这可能不是一个问题或者需要担心的事情。但是出于几个原因，例如 Snap 软件包的 Firefox 启动时间较长、且当 Firefox 有后台更新时，会有不必要的 Snap 更新通知等等原因，导致许多用户不太喜欢 Firefox 的 Snap 软件包。

因此，你可以按照 我写的另一篇操作指南，来完全删除 Firefox 的 Snap 软件包。这一过程有点复杂，需要花费一点时间。删除完成后，再从个人软件包存档（PPA）安装 deb…]]></summary>

though the project has done better on that score in recent years.  Ben
Cotton has announced in
Fedora Magazine that the upcoming Fedora 37 release, initially planned
for October 25, won't be happening until November 15.  The
immediate cause is an
impending OpenSSL update which fixes a vulnerability described as
"critical".


	Ironically, Fedora’s openness means we can’t start preparing ahead
	of time. All of our build pipelines and artifacts are open. If we
	were to start building updates, this would disclose the
	vulnerability before the embargo lifts. As a result, we only know
	that OpenSSL considers this the highest level of severity and Red
	Hat’s Product Security team strongly recommended we wait for a fix
	before releasing Fedora Linux 37.]]></summary>

 Caveats:
  
I have no interest in Arch or Arch-derivatives or rolling releases.
 Comments on other distros are observations/facts/personal opinions, not meant as criticism.
  
What went wrong with other distros:
 - My longest stint on something non-Ubuntu was Fedora (2+ years as a daily driver), and my second-longest was Debian (~3 months semi-daily driving).
 - I want vanilla Gnome desktop. Debian is too old and stuck on 3.38 for stable, and I really like the Gnome 40+ horizontal workspaces.
 - While Fedora is pretty much my dream distro, there are a couple of i…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The kernel thread “ksm” is also known as “Kernel Same Page Merging” (and “ksmd” is ksm demon). It is used by the KVM hypervisor to share identical memory pages (supported since kernel 2.6.32) Those shared pages could be common libraries or even user data which is identical. By doing so KVM (Kernel-based Virtual Machine) can avoid memory duplication and enable more VMs to run on a single node.
 In order for “ksmd” to save memory due to de-duplication we should compile the kernel with “CONFIG_KSM=y”. It is important to understand that the sharing of identical pages is done even if they are not shared by fork(). If you want to go over “ksmd” source code you can use the
 following link — https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/latest/source/mm/ksm.c.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello HN! We are Andres and Edgar and we are building MovingLake (https://movinglake.com). We are creating real-time, bidirectional data connectors which aim to solve automated ETL (eg moving data from an API to Snowflake), reverse ETL (we pipe the data straight to your CRM instead of going through the data warehouse),  and transactional integrations (e.g. for an ERP integration) in one swoop. Polling, webhooks, websockets, REST, GraphQL, SOAP—we merge it all into one reliable, replayable, real-time data stream which can be sent anywhere.
Here are two demos: Whatsapp to Google Sheets (https://youtu.be/Qy4eInGgIhw) and Postgres to Webhooks (https://youtu.be/cmrkUan8o1w).
Moving data around is still difficult and a pain. Companies spend thousands of hours and lots of money making data pipeli…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Look, I get it. Snaps are bloated, poorly optimized and need to be monitored more closely but I think if we ever want to see the year of the Linux desktop should we not be encouraging them? Not to mention I think it's a genuinely great idea that has been implemented poorly and needs some time to mature. 
 The biggest scare offs for the average user to transition over is installing applications. I agree pacman/sudo apt (app) install is not hard but the average normie is NEVER going to take the time to learn the basic commands when alternative operating systems allow them to simply click on "install". As someone who's been in dependency hell it's nice not having to install 3-4+ other programs when all I want to do is quickly use a program and remove it.
 From a security standpoint I think snaps are fantastic minus the snap store having malware on it (I've yet to come across it personally). Running everything in it's own sandbox with the dependencies being in the same sandbox? Hell yea! 
 Regular applications will always be there but giving users like grandma and the average consumer who just use their computers as boot-loaders for their web-browser a familiar / user friendly alternative is fantastic. I really fell that all the negative discourse around snaps is somewhat unjustified, albeit understandable given what the average Linux user is expecting from their OS.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Meta低于预期的业绩再次让市场恐慌。10月27日美股开盘，脸书（Facebook）母公司Meta（Nasdaq：META）股价跳水，跌幅一度扩大至24%，股价创下2016年以来最低，较股价最高点384美元缩水75%，市值不足2700亿美元。截至发稿，Meta跌幅缩窄至22.36%，报100.79美元。


此前的10月26日，Meta发布2022年第三季度财报，报告期内，公司营收下降4%至277.14亿美元，这是连续第二个季度出现营收同比下滑，此前的二季度是Meta史上首次营收下滑。


Meta第三季度净利润43.94亿美元，同比大幅下降52%，连续四个季度下降；每股收益（EPS）1.64美元，同比下降49%，低于分析师预期的1.98美元。《华尔街日报》称，近十年以来，Meta从未出现过连续第四个季度净利润下降的情况。


与此同时，Meta发布的第四季度业绩指引低于预期。Meta预计总营收在300到325亿美元，而分析师预计为322亿美元。Meta还预计2022年的总支出将在850至870亿美元之间，低于此前预测的850至880亿美元。


Meta创始人兼CEO马克·扎克伯格（Mark Zuckerberg）重申了他将花费数十亿美元开发元宇宙的承诺。


财报显示，Meta的元宇宙业务部门，今年以来已累计亏损94亿美元，而2021年曾亏损超100亿美元。


“显然，元宇宙是我们长期努力的目标，”扎克伯格在电话会议上表示，长期投资元宇宙业务“最终将会得到回报”。


扎克伯格说，Meta面临着许多挑战，例如经济逆风、苹果隐私政策以及来自TikTok等软件的竞争。他表示，“Meta将在未来不同时段解决这些问题。有耐心并投资我们的人最终将获得回报。”


然而就在本周，Meta的长期股东之一Altimeter Capital对烧钱的元宇宙提出不满，其CEO Brad Gerstner公开致信扎克伯格，希望Meta限制对现实实验室的投资，最好不超过50亿美元。此前Meta曾宣布，今年计划投资约100亿美元研发元宇宙相关技术。


据CNBC当地时间10月27日报道，摩根士丹利在当天下调了Meta的评级，分析师Brian Nowak将目标价从205美元下调至105美元。他预计，随着Meta继续在人工智能上烧钱，该公司将持续面临支出攀升的问题。

已经加入了微软的 systemd 创始人 Lennart Poettering 认为，在启用了安全启动的硬件上，虽然启动过程（包括内核）是签名的，但下一步，即加载 initrd，却没有签名。他提议将 Linux 启动过程转移到加密签名的统一内核镜像，使用 TPM 2.0 硬件加强 Linux 系统启动过程的安全性。initrd 是“初始化内存磁盘”，恶意软件或入侵者可以在 initrd 中插入恶意代码，而且每次系统启动时都会加载该代码，即使该恶意代码的其他副本不存在于硬盘上。

老王点评：想法是很好，但是这就是一个不透明的盒子。




Linux 内核开始为 800 Gbps 网络做准备

IEEE 已经发布了 800Gbps 网络的标准，而英伟达正在开发 800Gbps 网络硬件，其 Linux 内核驱动的开发人员确认，下一代英伟达 Spectrum ASIC 将支持 800Gbps 的速度。虽然 800Gbps 已经是目前最高端的 400Gbps 带宽的两倍，但以太网联盟今年的路线图已经将 1.6Tbps 网络作为未来几年内的计划。


消息来源：Phoronix



老王点评：Linux 内核在抛弃博物馆硬件的同时，越来越多的成为新硬件的第一批支持系统。




Fedora 40 正在为迁移到更现代的 C 语言标准做准备

1999 年发布的 C 语言标准（C99）删除了一些向后兼容的特性，然而，GCC 仍然默认接受这些过时的构造。但对这些结构体的支持让程序员感到困惑，并有可能影响 GCC 实现未来 C 标准中的功能。计划 2024 年发布的 GCC 14 编译器，正在考虑默认禁用对传统 C 语言结构的支持。LLVM 的开发者也正在考虑可能比这更早地禁用传统的 C 语言结构。Fedora 40 计划更主动地发现那些仍然依赖传统 C 语言行为的开源项目，以在 GCC 14 前就消除对旧的 C 语言标准的支持。


消息来源：Phoronix



老王点评：说是新的 C 语言标准，其实也有 20 多年了——都说程序员是喜新厌旧的，但是似乎都抱着自己用惯的语言不肯放手。]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Long time windows user here and I recently had to learn MacOS for work. For my day job I’m a data scientist and at home I like to dabble in all sort of programming projects. I kind of liked the idea of being “fluent” in both windows and MacOS so I thought maybe I could learn Linux as well. Did some research and found WSL and loved the idea of not having to dual boot so I tried to set up my dev environment on Linux….
 In the past 5 days with about 3 hours each day after work I have installed WSL, installed GWSL, got VS Code to connect to my Linux partition, installed some DS libraries, and ran a self built Qt app I was previously working on… at every stage of this journey there were problems which took hours to solve. All the while I just kept thinking to myself what’s the point? I’ve spent 95% of my time fighting with the OS and 5% coding. Is this just how it is or am I just that dumb?(which is very possible). I have to admit I have learned a TON but my god this is a steep learning curve.
 Am I doing this wrong? Any advice?

VirtualBox 能让任何人都可以轻松安装 Linux 虚拟机。你不需要有使用命令行的经验，就可以自己安装一个简单的 Linux 虚拟机。在虚拟机方面，我精通很多东西，但这篇文章将向新手展示如何安装一个 Linux 虚拟机。此外，这篇文章还概述了如何使用开源虚拟机管理程序 VirtualBox ，来运行以及安装一个测试目的的 Linux 系统。

一些术语

在开始之前，你需要了解在本安装教程中的两个操作系统（OS）之间的区别：


主机系统host system：这指的是你安装 VirtualBox 的操作系统（即本机的操作系统）。

客体系统guest system：这指的是你想要在主机系统之上运行的虚拟化系统。


在输入/输出、网络、文件访问、剪贴板、音频和视频方面，主机系统和客体系统都必须能够交互。

在本教程中，我将使用 Windows 10 作为 主机系统，Fedora 33 作为 客体系统。

安装前的准备

当我们谈论虚拟化时，实际上，我们指的是 硬件辅助虚拟化。硬件辅助虚拟化需要兼容的 CPU。过去十年来，几乎每个普通的 x86 CPU 都有这一功能。AMD 公司称这样的 x86 CPU 是具有 AMD 虚拟化技术（AMD-V） 的处理器，英特尔公司则称其是具有 Intel 虚拟化技术（VT-x） 的处理器。虚拟化功能增加了一些额外的 CPU 指令，你可以在 BIOS 中启用或禁用这些指令。

在安装虚拟机之前：


确保在 BIOS 中启用了虚拟化技术（AMD-V 或 VT-x）。

下载并安装好 VirtualBox。


准备虚拟机

下载你要用的 Linux 发行版的镜像文件。下载 32 位还是 64 位的操作系统镜像都…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[你可以按照以下步骤，来养成符合开放文化的习惯，并改掉那些不符合开放文化的习惯。




很久以来，我就对习惯很感兴趣。几年前，我做了一次关于习惯利弊的演讲，并且介绍了如何改变坏习惯、养成好习惯。不久前，我阅读了 Art Markman 教授的 《Smart Thinking》一书，这本书主要讨论的也是习惯。或许你会问习惯与 开放式组织的原则 有什么关系？这其中有一定的联系！我将会分成两篇文章，来解释你可以如何管理你的习惯。

在本文中，我们将讨论习惯如何工作的，以及更重要的是你如何去开始改变你的习惯。在下一篇文章中，我们将回顾 Markman 教授在他书中所表达的思想。

开放式组织原则和习惯的交集

设想你学习过开放式组织的原则，尽管你认为它们很有趣并且很有价值，但是你还没有对这些原则形成自己的习惯。以下就是你现实中会表现出来的样子。

社区：如果你面对一项重要挑战，但是你不知道如何独自解决它，你很有可能会由于习惯而放弃这项挑战。养成与由志同道合的人组成的社区，共同解决问题的习惯，不是更好吗？

协作：假设你认为你不善于合作，你喜欢独立完成任务。你知道有一些需要合作才能完成的事情，但是你并没有参与合作的习惯。为了弥补这种情况，你必须养成与他人更多合作的习惯。

信息共享：假如说你喜欢将你所做的事以及所知道的东西当作秘密。但是，你知道如果你不共享信息，你也无法从他人那里获取有用的信息。因此，你必须拥有共享信息的习惯。

包容性：想象一下，你与你不熟悉的人，或者是在个性、文化还是语言上都与你不同的人一起工作，你会感到不自在。但是，你知道如果你想要成功的话，你必须要和各种各样的人一同工作。那你该如何培养包容的习惯呢？

适应能力：假设当你所做的事情不再能达到你所希望的结果之后，你往往会拒绝改变。但是，你知道你必须适应这种情况，并重新调整你的努力，那你如何才…]]></summary>

        <id>https://linux.cn/article-15181-1.html?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss</id>
        <link href="https://linux.cn/article-15181-1.html?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss"/>
        <updated>2022-10-27T01:13:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[在这篇文章中，我们将介绍如何在 Ubuntu 服务器 22.04 上设置静态 IP 地址。


强烈建议在 Linux 服务器上使用静态 IP，因为它会在重启后保持不变。静态 IP 对邮件服务器、Web 服务器和文件服务器等服务器起着重要作用。

准备条件


最小安装的 Ubuntu 服务器 22.04

具有 sudo 管理员权限的普通用户


在 Ubuntu 服务器 22.04 中，网络由 netplan 程序控制，因此我们将使用 netplan 在 Ubuntu 服务器上配置静态 IP 地址。

注意：我们不能使用 nmcli 程序，因为它不是 Ubuntu 服务器上默认安装的一部分。

在 Ubuntu 服务器 22.04 上设置静态 IP 地址

登录到你的 Ubuntu 服务器 22.04，查找 netplan 配置文件。它位于 /etc/netplan 目录下。

$ cd /etc/netplan/
$ ls -l
total 4
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 116 Oct 12 04:03 00-installer-config.yaml
$


运行以下 cat 命令以查看 00-installer-config.yaml 的内容。

注意：配置文件的名称可能因你的设置而异。由于它是一个 yaml 文件，因此请确保在编辑时保持缩进和语法。

$ cat 00-installer-config.yaml


输出：



根据上面的输出，它说我们有 ens33 接口，它正在从 DHCP 服务器获取 IP。查看接口名称的另一种方法是通过 ip 命令。

现在，要配置静态 IP 代替 DHCP，使用 vi 或 nano 编辑器编辑 netplan 配置文件并添加以下内容。

$ sudo vi 00-installer-config.yaml
# This is the network config written by 'subiquity'
network:
  renderer: networkd
  ethernets:
    ens33:
      addresses:
        - 192.168.1.247/24
      nameservers:
        addresses: [4.2.2.2, 8.8.8.8]
      routes:
        - to: default
          via: 192.168.1.1
  version: 2


保存并关闭文件。



在上面的文件中，我们使用了以下内容，


ens33 为接口名称

用于设置静态 IP 的地址

nameservers 用于指定 DNS 服务器的 IP

用于指定默认网关的路由


注意：根据你的环境更改 IP 详细信息和接口名称。

要是上述修改生效，请使用以下 netplan 命令应用这些更改：

$ sudo netplan apply


运行以下 IP 命令查看接口上的 IP 地址：

$ ip addr show ens33


要查看默认路由，请运行：

$ ip route show


上述命令的输出。



完美，以上命令的输出确认静态 IP 和路由配置成功。

这就是这篇文章的全部内容。请在下面的评论部分发表你的问题和反馈。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm very new to Linux kernel development, and am confused about what exactly remoteproc and rpmsg are. Sounds like remoteproc is essentially, "how you tell a secondary processor or another core what to do", and rpmsg is "how to share memory between two processors". These are "frameworks", but is this well defined somewhere? If I want to understand this, what sorts of resources (websites, tutorials, textbooks) should I check out? If I had Linux 5.4 running on my device, how could I demonstrate use of remoteproc/rpmsg?
 What exactly then is this: https://github.com/OpenAMP/open-amp ? Is this source code meant to be included in an application and allow the application to control/communicate with other cores/coprocessors? This code ultimately must be compatible with the remoteproc/rpmsg drivers in my Linux kernel? Can someone explain how exactly this is happening?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Python has lots of different options for mutable data structures, both
directly in 
the language and in the standard library. Lists, dictionaries (or "dicts"), and
sets are the foundation, but two of those maintain an order based on how
the elements are added, while sets do not.  A recent discussion on the Python Discourse forum raised the
idea of adding an ordered variant of sets; while it does not look like
there is a big push to add the feature, the discussion did show some of
what is generally needed to get new things into the language—and could well
lead to its inclusion.]]></summary>

summary of the Netfilter workshop that was recently held in Seville.
"This year, the number of participants was just eight people, and this
allowed the setup to be a bit more informal. We had kind of an
un-conference style meeting, in which whoever had something prepared just
went ahead and opened a topic for debate."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[马斯克(Elon Musk)周三参观了Twitter的旧金山办公室，距离他完成收购这家社交媒体平台的最后期限还有几天。据《华尔街日报》(The Wall Street Journal)看到的一份内部通知，Twitter在一封内部通知中告诉员工，他们将在周五直接听到马斯克的讲话。


彭博(Bloomberg)援引知情人士的话报道，马斯克(Elon Musk)周一在与帮助收购Twitter交易融资的银行人士举行的视频电话会议上承诺，将在周五之前完成对这家社交媒体公司的收购。


报道称，为特斯拉(Tesla Inc., TSLA)提供130亿美元债务融资的银行已经完成了最终的信贷协议，目前正在签署文件，这是将现金转交给这位特斯拉首席执行官之前的最后步骤之一。


据彭博报道，银行预计将在周二收到借款通知，这是最后的手续之一，而现金预计将在周四存入托管账户。报道称，马斯克在视频电话会议中还承诺，在交易完成后，将帮助银行向基金经理推销这笔债务，这对七家参与融资的银行至关重要。


马斯克在Twitter上发布了一段视频，称正在进入Twitter总部，视频中他提着一个白色盆子走进Twitter总部。这位亿万富翁还将他的Twitter个人资料上的个人描述改为“首席Twit”，并将他的地址改为“Twitter总部”。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[GitHub 年入 10 亿美元

微软在财报会议上宣布了 GitHub 的一些新数据：GitHub 平台目前年收入 10 亿美元，高于收购时报告的 2 至 3 亿美元。GitHub 现在有 9000 万的活跃用户，高于收购结束时的 2800 万。微软于 2018 年以 75 亿美元收购了 GitHub。


消息来源：Tech Crunch



老王点评：可以说，微软给 GitHub 带来了更大的发展，当然，GitHub 也成了微软的一座宝库。




不管同意不同意，名人的“深度伪造”开始出现在广告中

上周，埃隆･马斯克似乎在一家房地产投资公司的营销视频中出演。而上个月，机器学习公司 Paperspace 的宣传视频中出现了汤姆･克鲁斯和莱昂纳多･迪卡普里奥等演员。这些名人都没有花时间拍摄这些宣传片，他们甚至从未同意为有关公司代言。这和好莱坞传奇人物 布鲁斯･威利斯 的情况不同，使用“深度伪造”技术创作的宣传片是威利斯授权制作的。


消息来源：华尔街日报



老王点评：这种图像融合技术越来越受欢迎，给营销行业带来了新的法律和道德问题。




图片巨头开始销售 AI 生成的图片

AI 图像生成器会不会扼杀图片销售行业？该行业的巨头的答案是“不会” —— 如果他们能先开始销售 AI 生成的内容，就不会。Shutterstock 宣布与 OpenAI 扩大合作，DALL-E 2 将直接整合到 Shutterstock 中。此外，Shutterstock 将向提供了 AI 创作素材的作者们支付费用。另一方面，Shutterstock 禁止在其网站上销售未使用其 DALL-E 整合的 AI 生成的艺术作品。


消息来源：The Verge



老王点评：螳臂当车而已，随着 AI 普及化，谁还会去买图片？那时候可能各种 AI 图片及其素材都会进入公共领域。]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ubuntu Budgie 22.10 是一个有趣的版本，它删除了几个 GNOME 应用程序，以及一些其他改进。




Ubuntu Budgie 是 Ubuntu 的官方版本，因其传统的桌面界面和最小的软件膨胀而广受欢迎。

Ubuntu Budgie 22.10 的发布带来了一些关键的调整和补充。

🆕 Ubuntu Budgie 22.10 有什么新变化



基于 Ubuntu 22.10 “充满活力的捻角羚Kinetic Kudu”，Ubuntu Budgie 22.10 带来了 Budgie 桌面 10.6.4 和许多其他改进。

一些值得注意的亮点包括:


增强型 Budgie 控制中心Control Center

更新了 Budgie 的“欢迎Welcome”应用

替换各种基于 GNOME 的应用程序

对翻译进行了更新


Budgie 桌面和控制中心



Budgie 桌面以及更新到 V10.6.4, 它添加了一个新的全局选项来控制小程序之间的间距，并对工作区和时钟小程序进行了各种改进。



Budgie 控制中心Control Center也得到了一堆调整，例如重新设计的显示颜色配置文件支持，修改了对屏幕分享的支持，如 RDP 和 VNC，用于显示缩放的选项，等等。

升级了欢迎应用



Ubuntu Budgie 22.10 特别升级了 Budgie 的欢迎应用，改善了翻译以及一些其他改进。

默认的应用的变化

Ubuntu Budgie 的开发人员已经开始替换和删除基于 GNOME 的应用程序，转而使用基于 MATE 的应用程序和其他替代品。

他们决定这样做是因为基于 GNOME 的应用程序在 Budgie 中的外观与其他具有圆角边缘的应用程序的外观不一致。

这些不一致是由于 GNOME 根据其样式和主题需求而转到 Libadwaita 库造成的。

Libadwaita 库是 GNOME 的一个有争议的补充，没有多少用户喜欢，你可以通过我们的报道来了解更多信息。


你对在 Linux 世界中 GNOME 的 Libadwaita 库怎么看？


以下是一些已删除或替换的应用程序：


GNOME 计算器被 MATE 计算器取代。

删除了 GNOME 日历。

GNOME 系统监视器已由 MATE 系统监视器取代。

删除了 GNOME 截图。

字体管理器 替代了 GNOME 字体查看器。


🛠️ 其他改变

其他改变包括以下：


重新开发的内置主题

移除 PulseAudio，并支持 PipeWire

原生的截图功能

支持 WebP 图像

能够查看显示器的刷新率


你可以通过 发行说明 了解更多。

📥 下载 Ubuntu Budgie 22.10

你可以在 Ubuntu 中央镜像仓库 或者它的 官方网站 下载最新的 ISO。

其官方网站可能需要一段时间才能提供 ISO。


下载 Ubuntu Budgie 22.10



💡 Ubuntu Budgie 22.10 将支持 9 个月直到 2023 年 6 月。如果你想使用稳定的功能，更应该选择 LTS 版本。


💬 你如何看待这个非 LTS 版本？愿意尝试一下吗？

由于运行上千个应用程序容器荚Pod所耗费的资源多，令它实现较少工作节点和资源占用所需成本也较高，所以在使用 Kubernetes 时，快速启动和较少的内存占用是至关重要的。在 Kubernetes 平台运行容器化微服务时，内存占用是比吞吐量更重要的考量因素，这是因为：


由于需要持续运行，所以耗费资源更多（不同于 CPU 占用）

微服务令开销成本成倍增加

一个单体应用程序变为若干个微服务的情况（例如 20 个微服务占用的存储空间约有 20GB）


这些情况极大影响了无服务器函数的发展和 Java 部署模型。到目前为止，许多企业开发人员选择 Go、Python 或 Node.js 这些替代方案来解决性能瓶颈，直到出现了 Quarkus 这种基于 kubernetes 的原生 Java 堆栈，才有所改观。本文介绍如何在使用了 Quarkus 的 kubernetes 平台上进行性能优化，以便运行无服务器函数。

容器优先的设计理念

由于 Java 生态系统中传统的框架都要进行框架的初始化，包括配置文件的处理、classpath 的扫描、类加载、注解的处理以及构建元模型，这些过程都是必不可少的，所以它们都比较耗费资源。如果使用了几种不同的框架，所耗费的资源也是成倍增加。

Quarkus 通过“左移shifting left”，把所有的资源开销大的操作都转移到构建阶段，解决了这些 Java 性能问题。在构建阶段进行代码和框架分析、字节码转换和动态元模型生成，而且只有一次，结果是：运行时可执行文件经过高度优化，启动非常快，不需要经过那些传统的启动过程，全过程只在构建阶段执行一次。



更重要的是：Quarkus 支持构建原生可执行文件，它具有良好性能…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[前天，我收到了腾讯官方发来的一个警告：


“因用户投诉并经平台审核，你的小程序涉嫌滥用小程序接口能力，影响用户体验行为。”


惊讶之下，我发现是我们几年前为了解决公众号文章内不能放置链接而开发的“文章助手”小程序被警告了。

众所周知，一般情况下，微信文章不能像网页一样放入链接的。对于一般的文字性内容，这其实并无大碍，但是对于我们这种技术类文章，常常会有一些链接，以便读者可以深入了解相关内容。因此，这种限制对我们来说是一种缺陷，为了解决这种问题，我们陆续想过几种方法，比如利用文末的“阅读原文”、在文章内注明完整链接等。最后，我们在 2019 年想到可以开发一个小程序来 辅助提供 这个链接。

通过一些 简单的方式，可以在你的微信文章中需要放置链接的地方嵌入这个“文章助手”小程序。用户只需要点击该小程序链接，即可显示该链接，并自动复制链接到剪贴板，然后只需要打开浏览器粘贴访问即可。

我自己对这种委曲求全的解决方案感觉比较满意。

现在，这个有两年没有继续添加新功能的小程序被警告了。于是我仔细查看了警告内容，在腾讯官方提供的《微信小程序平台运营规范》中是这样说的：


5.15.4 滥用操作剪切板接口

在用户使用剪切板功能进行复制操作后，恶意、强行中断小程序内功能服务或业务的完整流程，要求用户跳转或使用其他方式才可完整体验业务流程，影响用户体验。

用户未进行任何操作情况下，小程序默认读取用户剪切板信息。


考虑到申诉基本上不会得到解决（事实上我申诉了，也被驳回了），我只能修改相关代码，将以下行为做了调整：


不检测剪贴板内容长度（原本是为了避免当剪贴板内有较多内容而被覆盖）

不自动复制链接到剪贴板，而需要用户手动点击一下才复制


以我的估计，这样就不算滥用了吧？……

然而，新版本提交之后，紧接着，“文章助手”小程序就被封了剪贴板能力：


因用户投诉并经平台审核，发现帐号已发布的服务涉嫌滥用小程序接口能力，影响用户体验

已封禁服务的“操作剪贴板”能力


哑然。

无奈之下再次发起无用的申诉（已被驳回），并寻求客服解答。经过漫长的等待，客服给出了如下答复：


审核部门排查发现你的小程序内活动通过文本口令引导跳转其他渠道体验或进行，属于滥用剪切板能力 请开发者对小程序进行全面排查以及整改，将涉及违规的内容移除(包括但不仅限于内容展示、代码、路径等)，如有隐藏内容、路径、代码等，也需一并移除


呵，合着是不让用户粘贴链接到浏览器啊！

原本“文章助手”小程序内会提示用户“链接已复制，请在浏览器内粘贴打开”，看来这是摸了老虎屁股了。

而没有剪贴板能力的“文章助手”小程序，可以说是已经失去了一半用处。

那现在我有两个选择：


放弃这个小程序（这样我也不用每个月支付云开发的 20 元费用，需要说明的是，这个小程序是完全免费，没有任何广告和赞助，公益提供给任何人使用的）；

看看是否还有抢救的机会。


考虑到这个小程序已经累计有了 16 万用户，并为近 50 万个链接提供过服务，如果就此关闭，是对既往用户的不负责。因此，经过我灵机一动，我考虑可以完整地显示链接，让用户自己复制，至于复制后干什么，我不说，我也不知道，我也不想知道。

所以，你看的 0.4.7 版的“文章助手”就是这样了。

至于这样是否还会触犯腾讯的禁忌，我就不知道了，只能说，大家且行且珍惜吧。]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Lennart Poettering has posted a
detailed specification for a new approach to "trusted computing"
systems.


	Central to the proposed design is the concept of a Unified Kernel
	Image (UKI). These UKIs are the combination of a Linux kernel
	image, and initrd, a UEFI boot stub program (and further resources,
	see below) into one single UEFI PE file that can either be directly
	invoked by the UEFI firmware (which is useful in particular in some
	cloud/Confidential Computing environments) or through a boot loader
	(which is generally useful to implement support for multiple kernel
	versions, with interactive or automatic selection of image to boot
	into, potentially with automatic fallback management to increase
	robustness).


This work is evidently the first in a series that will come out of the
newly formed Linux Userspace API
Group.]]></summary>

To get your hands dirty a bit we have a stateless and signupless demo you can try out: https://hn.paigo.tech/ and a video of me walking through the system in a bit more detail: https://youtu.be/T6J1Yh8GhdU.
The idea of our platform is fairly straightforward: You give us read-only access to your SaaS backend and based on tenant metadata for your infrastructure, we measure, persist, and aggregate SaaS tenant usage data to give a clear picture of per-client usage. We can measure metrics like API requests, Compute time, Data Storage, Transaction Volumes and many more. Some common scena…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[这些天，我的一台放网站的服务器经常负载很高，上面安装了一个WordPress网站，查看日志，经常有人抓取wp-login.php，估计是黑客攻击，导致大量数据库访问造成负载过高。


WordPress其实是一个很常见的建站工具，估计很多人都会用到，我这里就介绍一下我的解决方案。


1、WordPress静态化


先针对WordPress网站实施全站静态化处理，我用的插件是“super-static-cache”这个插件，可以实现文章和目录的静态化。


不过，使用“super-static-cache”这个插件后，目录和tag会存在重定向问题，即自动从一个无“/”的目录跳转到一个有“/”的目录，正常浏览虽无问题，但对SEO不友好，最好再安装一个名为“permalink-trailing-slash-fixer”的插件来解决分类目录重定向问题。


2、添加防火墙规则


经过WordPress静态化处理之后，正常用户访问网站应该不会访问到php文件，这时候，给网站加一个防火墙，推荐使用免费的cloudflare，在防火墙后台-“安全性”-“WAF”里，增加一个规则，当“完整URL”包含“php”的时候，则执行防火墙的“托管质询”操作。


表达式为：http.request.full_uri contains "php"


我在主机上实际操作，部署了该防火墙规则之后，发现服务器整体负载立刻就恢复正常了。防火墙后台查看了一下，CSR（质询解决率）为0，说明全部都是机器抓取，并且全部都过滤掉了，效果非常不错。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Python 3.11 发布：性能大幅提升

得益于 Faster CPython 项目，Python 3.11 在性能方面提升巨大。在 Ubuntu Linux 上使用 Pyperformance 基准测试套件和 GCC 编译时，CPython 3.11 比 CPython 3.10 平均快 25%。根据你的工作负载，速度可能会提高 10-60%。


消息来源：Python



老王点评：之前 Guido 曾经希望能速度翻倍，但是看起来距离目标大打折扣啊。




欧洲理事会正式批准统一 USB-C 法案

10 月初，欧洲议会通过一项法案：自 2024 年起部分消费电子产品必须提供单一的 USB-C 充电接口。这项法案经欧洲议会主席和理事会主席签署生效后，将在 24 个月后开始实施。新规定将适用于广泛的便携式设备，而生效的 40 个月后，所有笔记本电脑的充电接口也将被规定使用 USB-C 接口。据数据，此前充电器每年产生约 11000 吨电子垃圾。


消息来源：MacRumors



老王点评：不管苹果乐意不乐意，它都得接受了。




Linux 考虑淘汰对英特尔 i486 CPU 的支持

Linux 内核在十年前移除对 i386 的支持后，i486 是内核主线对 x86 架构支持的最低版本，Linus Torvalds 认为应该让 x86-32 架构支持的最低版本提高到奔腾及更高版本。他指出 i486 已经被视为可以在博物馆里展示的展品，不如让它们运行博物馆版本的内核。


消息来源：Phoronix



老王点评：嗯，确实，我在 1995 年买的第一台计算机就是 486DX266 的，这都快三十年了。]]></summary>

 Edit: yes, I know 'feeling' should be plural, I just noticed that and can't edit a title.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[如今 SSH 已成为了登录远程服务器的默认方式。


SSH 的全称是 “安全的 ShellSecure Shell”，它功能强大、效率高，这个主流的网络协议用于在两个远程终端之间建立连接。让我们不要忘记它名称的“安全”部分，SSH 会加密所有的通信流量，以防止如劫持、窃听等攻击，同时提供不同的身份认证方式和无数个配置选项。

在这份新手指南中，你会学到：


SSH 的基本概念

设置 SSH 服务器（在你想要远程登录的系统上）

从客户端（你的电脑）通过 SSH 连接远程服务器


SSH 的基本概念

在学习配置过程前，让我们先了解一下 SSH 的全部基础概念。

SSH 协议基于客户端-服务器server-client（CS）架构。“服务器Server”允许“客户端Client”通过通信通道进行连接。该信道是经过加密的，信息交换通过 SSH 公私钥进行管理。



OpenSSH 是在 Linux、BSD 和 Windows 系统上提供 SSH 功能的最流行的开源工具之一。

想要成功配置 SSH，你需要：


在作为服务器的机器上部署 SSH 服务器组件，它由 openssh-server 包提供。

在你远程访问服务器的客户端机器上部署 SSH 客户端组件，它由 openssh-client 包提供，大多数 Linux 和 BSD 发行版都已经预装好了。


区分服务器和客户端是十分重要的事情。或许你不想要你的 PC 作为 SSH 服务器，除非你有充分理由希望其他人通过 SSH 连接你的系统。

通常来说，你有一个专用的服务器系统。例如，一个 运行 Ubuntu 的树莓派。你可以 启用树莓派的 SSH 服务，这样你可以在你 PC 中的终端中，通过 SSH 控制并管理该设备。

有了这些信息，让我们看看如何在 Ubuntu…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This kernel thread “khungtaskd” is used in order to help with identifying and debugging “Hung Tasks”. This kernel thread is scheduled every 120 seconds (that is the default value). We can say “khungtaskd” is used for detecting tasks which are stuck in uninterruptible sleep (state “D” in ps output). The code of the kernel thread can be read in the following link https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/latest/source/kernel/hung_task.c.
 The basic algorithm of “khungtaskd” is as follows: Iterate over all running tasks on the system and if there are ones marked as TASK_UNINTERRUPTIBLE and it was scheduled at least once in the last 120 seconds it is considered as hung. When a task is considered hung it’s “call stack” is dumped and if the CONFIG_LOCKDEP is also enabled then all of the locks held by the tasks are outpted also.
 If we want we can change the sampling interval using the sysctl interface, “/proc/sys/kernel/hung_task_timeout_secs” .We can also verify that the default is 120 seconds by reading it — as shown in the screenshot below.
 In order to demonstrate the operation of “khungtaskd” I have executed the following bpftrace one liner — “sudo bpftrace -e ‘kfunc:check_hung_uninterruptible_tasks { printf(“ %s:%d\n”,curtask->comm,curtask->pid); }’”. The trace prints the name of the task and it’s pid when the function “check_hung_uninterruptible_tasks” is called (https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/latest/source/kernel/hung_task.c#L178) — You can see the output in the screenshot below.
 See you in my next writeup ;-)
 ​
 sudo bpftrace -e ‘kfunc:check_hung_uninterruptible_tasks { printf(“ %s:%d\n”,curtask->comm,curtask->pid); }

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ubuntu MATE 22.10 已经发布，其中有一些细微而有用的变化。来看看吧！




Ubuntu MATE 是 Ubuntu 官方版本 之一，每次升级都会增加有趣的改进。

它的目标用户是那些既珍惜传统桌面的外观和感觉，又渴望现代操作系统的功能的用户。

Ubuntu MATE 22.10 版本增加了许多改进和功能，让我们来看看这些。

Ubuntu MATE 22.10 的新变化



基于非 LTS 版本的 Ubuntu 22.10 ，Ubuntu MATE 22.10 带来了多项更新，一些关键的亮点包括：


对 MATE 桌面的改进。

新的 AI 墙纸。

PipeWire 是默认的音频服务器。

新的 MATE 用户管理器。

Firefox 105 更新。

LibreOffice 7.4。



💡 注意，Ubuntu MATE 的升级通常包括更多的功能补充。但这一次，Martin Wimpress 一直致力于为 Debian MATE 版带来类似的体验。你可以在我们之前的报道中阅读更多细节。



准备好在 Debian Linux 上获得 Ubuntu MATE 体验吧！


MATE 桌面升级



MATE 桌面收到了各种错误修复和对 Ayatana 指示器、MATE 面板的更新。

现在，你可以将小程序居中对齐，与通常的左右对齐选项一起。

这项功能将在 MATE 桌面 1.28 版中正式出现，但 Ubuntu MATE 团队在 MATE 桌面 1.27 版的基础上将其与这个版本一起推出。

MATE 用户管理器



MATE 用户管理器是该发行版的一个新的补充，允许你添加、修改、删除用户账户。

有了它，你可以选择哪些用户可以成为管理员、设置自动登录、设置个人资料图片，以及管理组成员资格。对于有多个用户的计算机来说，这是一个相当方便和急需的功能。

新的 AI 壁纸



这个版本的另一大亮点是增加了新的 AI 生成的壁纸。

这些看起来很美 😍

鉴于人工智能生成的壁纸现在正大行其道，Ubuntu MATE 团队在 Ubuntu MATE 22.10 中加入了一批新的壁纸。

它是由 Simon Butcher 使用扩散模型创建的，用来描画 “捻角羚”。

Linux 内核 5.19

Ubuntu MATE 22.10 得益于 Linux 内核 5.19 带来的改进，对各种 ARM SoC、Arc Alchemist GPU 等提供了增强支持。

你可以阅读我们的相关报道以了解更多。

🛠️ 其他变化和改进

与其他新版本一样，Ubuntu MATE 22.10 用 PipeWire 取代了 PulseAudio，以获得更好的音频处理，并加入了额外的蓝牙编解码器，如 AAC、LDAC、aptX 和 aptX HD。

其他值得注意的变化包括：


更新的应用程序包括：Firefox 105、LibreOffice 7.4、Celluloid 0.20 和 Evolution 3.46。

Ubuntu MATE HUD 支持 MATE、XFCE 和 Budgie，具有更多的配置能力。


如果你感到好奇，你可以查看 Ubuntu MATE 22.10 官方发布说明。

下载 Ubuntu MATE 22.10

你可以从 Ubuntu 的中央镜像库 或其 官方网站 下载最新的 ISO。

它的官方网站/仓库可能需要一段时间来提供 ISO。


💡 Ubuntu MATE 22.10 将被支持九个月，直到 2023 年 7 月 。如果你想要稳定而不是功能，你应该更喜欢使用 LTS 版本。



下载 Ubuntu MATE 22.10

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Kubuntu 22.10 可能不是最令人兴奋的升级。但是，它包括了一些有用的变化。




Kubuntu 是 Ubuntu 的一个官方版本，它在一个精致的 KDE 驱动的软件包中提供了很多功能。

Kubuntu 22.10 的发布带来了各种改进和一个 KDE Plasma 的更新版本。

让我们来看看这个版本的亮点。

Kubuntu 22.10 有什么新变化？



Kubuntu 22.10 带来了很多更新，其中一些重要的更新包括：


KDE Plasma 5.25

Linux 内核 5.19

PipeWire

Firefox 104

Qt 5.15.6



💡 Kubuntu 22.10 将被支持九个月，直到 2023 年 7 月。如果你想要稳定而不是功能，你应该更喜欢使用 LTS 版本。


KDE Plasma 5.25



尽管最近 KDE Plasma 5.26 已经发布了，但 Kubuntu 22.10 还是搭载了 KDE Plasma 5.25。

然而，KDE Plasma 5.25 与 5.24 相比仍然是一个重大的更新，它包含了很多改进，例如，加强了对触摸板/触摸屏的支持，升级了用户界面等等。

你可以阅读我们对 KDE Plasma 5.25 的报道来了解更多。


KDE Plasma 5.25：颜色、主题和其他改进


另外，你可以期待 KDE Plasma 5.26 作为一个小版本发布，而不是作为 Kubuntu 22.10 发布的一部分。

默认采用 PipeWire

像大多数基于 Ubuntu 22.10 的发行版一样，PipeWire 是这个版本的 Kubuntu 的默认音频/视频处理器。

它取代了 PulseAudio，众所周知，它与 Ubuntu 22.10 不兼容。

Linux 内核 5.19



Kubuntu 22.10 采用了最新的 Linux 内核 5.19，这应该会带来对 ARM SoC 和 Arc Alchemist GPU 的支持、Btrfs 的各种改进、对 AMD RDNA3 图形的初步支持等等。

测试用的 Wayland 会话



Kubuntu 22.10 具有对 Plasma Wayland 会话的初步支持，但它仅用于测试目的，并不是一个完整的集成。



其他升级

其他一些更新包括：


自定义桌面重点颜色

默认浏览器是 Firefox 104 Snap

Qt 5.15.6

LibreOffice 7.4

改进的应用程序商店


要探索更多关于该版本的信息，请参考 官方发布说明。

下载 Kubuntu 22.10

你可以从 Ubuntu 的中央镜像库 或其 官方网站 下载最新的 ISO。


Kubuntu 22.10


它的官方网站可能需要一段时间来提供 ISO。

💬 你对这个版本感到兴奋吗？

awkwardness that comes when trying to interface Python and Rust code.


	The challenge is that if you want to pass some bytes to a Rust
	library to parse them (or do any other processing for that matter),
	the library almost certainly expects a &[u8], and
	there’s no way to turn a &[ReadOnlyCell<u8>]
	into a &[u8] safely, without allocating and
	copying. And of course, the whole point of the Python buffer
	protocol is to avoid these sorts of inefficiencies.

	Therefore, the regrettable solution is that, right now, there is no
	way to have all three of: efficiency, interoperability, and
	soundness.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[AR tech is looming around the corner and imo this tech is really going to be mainstream in no time. I have been thinking about how AR is going to be implemented in different operating systems and I really think this tech could be a really useful tool for every Linux user in no time given the right implementation. is there anyone working on AR in the context of Linux out there?
 It could be a great tool for new users coming to Linux and veteran super users alike, some ideas I have:
 - AR terminals
 - AR tree representation of your location in the current directory(2D or even 3D)
 - AR VMs and workstations
 - quick looks into background operations
 - AR vertical screens
 note: I am a novice programmer who started uni recently. also, I am >1month new Linux user so I could be really off with those ideas for the veterans.
 I really think that from all the OSs out there this tech fits Linux users the most. how many times a day do you open the terminal? create VMs? open vscode in your vertical screen? all those could potentially be moved to the AR glasses making "another layer" on top & cleaner laptop screen. I am sure there are many more ideas that I am too new to even think about.
 edit: typos
 edit2: for all the people that think its still far from reality look at this video from the last apple event 👀.

Linux 的通用 TUN 驱动为用户空间的程序提供数据包接收和传输，该驱动长期以来一直在 Linux 内核中使用，可用于 VPN、Open vSwitch 等用途。将近二十年前，Linux TUN 驱动设置了一个 10Mbps 链接的标称速度，这在当时足够了。但是现在，Linux 网络堆栈和硬件都有了很大的进步。开发者提出了一个补丁，将该设定值提升一千倍到 10Gbps，并建议干脆取消该限制，而让应用程序/用户自己决定一个正确的值。

GitHub 准备推出细粒度的个人访问令牌

GitHub 在 2020 年提供了 OAuth 认证，再之后，GitHub.com 所有认证的 Git 操作都需要基于令牌的认证，而不再接受账户密码。但 GitHub 的个人访问令牌只能被赋予有限的权限，也不是按仓库分配的，而且只有几个宽泛的类别。新的正在测试中的令牌是细粒度的，每个仓库有 25 种权限，其中大部分权限可以设置为只读、读写或不访问，另外有 14 种权限与账户管理有关。


消息来源：Devclass



老王点评：确实这是必要的，只是我原本以为这种细粒度的设置应该更早来到。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We are going to talk about the kernel thread “idle_inject”, which was merged to the kernel in about 2009. The goal of “idle_inject” is forcing idle time on a CPU in order to avoid overheating.
 If we think about it, “idle_inject” adds latency, thus it should be considered only if CPUFreq (CPU Frequency scaling) is not supported. Due to the fact the majority of modern CPUs are capable of running a different clock frequency and voltage configuration we can use CPUFreq in order to avoid overheating.
 Overall, there is one “idle_inject” kernel thread per processor (with the name pattern “idle_inject/N”, where N is the id of the processor) — as shown in the screenshot below. Also, all of them are created at init time.
 The “idle_inject” kernel threads will call “idle_inject_fn()”->”play_idle_precise()” to inject a specified amount of idle time. After all of the kernel threads are woken up, the OS sets a timer for the next cycle. When the timer interrupt handler wakes the threads for all processors based on a defined “cpu-mask” (affected by idle injection). By the way, when I set a kprobe on “idle_inject_fn()” for 3 hours on my VM it was never called ;-)
 Running “idle_inject” kernel threads

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ubuntu 22.10 是一个令人印象深刻的版本，它拥有新的快速切换功能、应用程序散布，以及更多。




Ubuntu 22.10 “充满活力的捻角羚Kinetic Kudu”来了。它带来了许多重大的改进，特别是 Linux 内核 5.19 和 GNOME 43 的体验。

当然，这是一个经过定制的 GNOME 体验，现有的 Ubuntu 用户会很熟悉。

那么，Ubuntu 22.10 都有哪些新变化呢？让我们一起来看看。

Ubuntu 22.10 的新变化



除了 GNOME 43 之外，Ubuntu 22.10 还包括：


一个改进的 设置Settings 应用程序。

经典的 Unity 应用程序散布模式Spread Mode的复活。

一些著名的应用程序被移植到 GTK4 和 Libadwaita。

全系统支持 WebP。

PipeWire 采样管默认的音频服务器。

Linux 内核 5.19。



💡 Ubuntu 22.10 将被支持九个月，直到 2023 年 7 月。如果你想要稳定而不是功能，你应该更愿意使用 LTS 版本。


🎨 视觉改进

当第一次测试一个新版本时，视觉上的变化总是最先被注意到的。在 Ubuntu 22.10 中尤其如此，这要归功于 GNOME 43 所带来的重大改进。



首先，我们有全新的快速设置菜单，它取代了旧的、相当笨拙的系统菜单。与安卓、iOS 和 Windows 11 中的菜单类似，这个新增的菜单允许你打开和关闭 Wi-Fi 和蓝牙，所有这些都无需进入设置Settings应用程序。

当然，在这个版本中我们还得到了全新的壁纸。



对于这个变化，我除了喜欢并希望从社区中看到更多这样的设计之外，没有什么别的可说的。

此外，更多的应用程序被移植到…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[当商业 DevOps 工具市场着眼于平台时，是时候让开源 DevOps 工具重新定义它们的未来了。


DevOps 的开源根基是无法动摇的，即便有预言称全球的 DevOps 市场将在 2026 年之前达到 178 亿美元。不断变化的工作环境、安全和合规性问题，以及风险投资公司等等因素正在将市场推向 DevOps 平台，开发团队可以在云中获得完整的端到端 DevOps 工具链。

开源 DevOps 工具现状

我们要搞清楚一件事：开源工具不可能从 DevOps 世界中消失。现在，在开源和供应商提供的 DevOps 工具之间存在着一种平衡，开发人员会在两者间选择适合他们的工具。事实上，很多情况下，一个开发团队起初会为他们的 DevOps 流水线选择一个开源工具，后来又升级到商业版本。

三种开源 DevOps 工具实例

下面我们介绍一些开源 DevOps 工具的例子，每种工具都已经有了围绕其建立的商业化生态。

Git

源代码管理工具 Git 作为源代码库，可能是 DevOps 工具链的主要基础之一。

Git 的两个最佳商业案例是 GitLab 和 GitHub。GitLab 接受开发者对其贡献开源项目。GitHub 也在着手努力成为一个 DevOps 平台，推出了人工智能版的结对编程 GitHub Copilot，在推出后受到了一些开源团体的褒贬不一的评价。

Jenkins

作为一个开源的自动化服务，Jenkins 因其易于安装、配置和可扩展性而受到推崇。

CloudBees 提供了 JenkinsX，JenkinsX 是一套开源的解决方案，可以为 Kubernetes 上的云原生应用提供自动化持续集成和持续交付（CI/CD）以及自动化测试工具。他们还为JenkinsX 提供商业支持，包括：

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Just got a Steam Deck last week. It's wonderfully user friendly, able to mod it new analog sticks and a new NVMe SSD into it without too much fuss. Now that I've installed some games, I was quite easily able to plugin a monitor, keyboard, mouse, ethernet with one of those all in one USB-C hubs. No need for special equipment the same stuff I use for my regular desktop. I love this thing! Using this in desktop mode is so freakin cool. It's more powerful than an RPi and I can do anything I want with it like any normal PC. Currently browsing for apps to install and visiting web pages using Firefox on the device itself! How cool is that? So refreshing from devices like PSP, Switch, PS5, even iOS that are horribly locked down and useless outside the limited scope the manufacturer allows. 
 Given how I can now play a huge majority of my PC titles on the go and overall how good SteamOS is doing I feel like this is moving the Linux platform into a new space we've never seen before and also making Linux mainstream with a lot of people who would otherwise may not directly interact with a full fledged Linux OS otherwise.

I updated from 21.04 to 21.10 like an hour ago. At first the graphic UI didn't show up, I had to reboot, boot again with kernel 5.15, I got access to gui, did an apt upgrade and restart again and fortunately this time gui loaded with kernel 5.19 :/ BUT IT'S NOT ALL now I can't connect to the internet because of some DNS problem or something. My /etc/resolve.conf file is corrupted AMD STILL IT'S NOT ALL sudo command gives me error. It keep saying can't resolve hostname 😐😐 What the hell 
 Btw. Gnome 43 is so much more beautiful than 42

 This workflow consists of building a pretty small project with bitbake. First I clear all the cached build artifacts and bitbake state with:
 bitbake --continue -c cleansstate world 
 Then I time the build with:
 time env BB_NUMBER_THREADS=24 bitbake core-image-minimal 
 The results for some kernel versions are as follows. They were run remotely on a system without much else going on. I went back to an older kernel to verify it wasn't thermals or some other factor:
 Running: 5.19.12-200.fc36.x86_64 Consecutive clean then builds: 4:47.04, 4:32.70, 4:31.97, 4:33.95 Running: 6.1.0-0.rc1.20221019gitaae703b02f92.17.fc38.x86_64 Consecutive: 10:40.29, 10:36.63, 10:43.97 Switch back to older kernel to verify: 5.19.16-200.fc36.x86_64 Run One: 4:30.47 Test again: 6.1.0-0.rc1.20221019gitaae703b02f92.17.fc38.x86_64 Run One: 10:41.64 
 All kernels were installed from the Fedora repos. 6.1-rc1 is from the rawhide repo. I have not yet run any profiling to find what's taking so long. I know these tests aren't very scientific, but I figured it would be good to let people know my experience.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So i've been using windows for my whole life from XP to 11 . Last week windows 11 just decided that bluetooth would stop working with xbox controller , i've tried every solution on the internet with no effect . So i decided to give Linux a try. Most of the software i use daily is on linux already ( Blender , Substance painter, Davinci Resolve ) . I'm a gamer but i mostly use cloud gaming service GFN, so that wouldn't be a problem too . After a bit of research on youtube i chose PopOs as my new system.
 First few days were extremely frustrating . From not knowing how to install apps properly ( altough there is app store, it doesn't have all the apps ) to some weird glitches like master volume being set to -55db after installing easyeffects .
 But after spending some time with the system i'm starting to like it . I've learned a few terminal commands and installing apps with commands is now faster and easier than app store. I like that system is consistent , if i enable dark mode it is used everywhere. Unlike on a windows ,where half of MICROSOFT apps do not respect the dark more. Now i like HTOP more than windows performance monitor , which if someone told me earlier i'd think they are insane. Also feels good not supporting Microsoft's monopoly.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[共和党全国委员会（RNC）已在加利福尼亚州的一家美国地方法院对Google提起诉讼，指控其将竞选邮件放入其数百万用户的垃圾邮件文件夹。Google上个月推出了一项试点计划，后来被联邦选举委员会批准，以防止竞选邮件被放入垃圾邮件。但美国全国委员会一直在批评该计划，认为它对政治邮件过滤的帮助不够。


诉讼称，Google"在选举筹款和社区建设的关键时刻，将数以百万计的RNC电子邮件集体归入潜在捐助者和支持者的垃圾邮件文件夹"。


"Google最令人震惊的过滤时间尤其令人震惊，"RNC断言。"在每个月的大部分时间里，几乎所有RNC的邮件都会进入用户的收件箱。在每个月末的大约同一时间，Google将几乎所有RNC的电子邮件都发送到了垃圾邮件中。关键的是，也是可疑的是，从历史上看，这个月末时期是RNC的筹款最成功的时候。"


另一方则表示："正如我们反复说的，我们根本不根据政治派别来过滤电子邮件，"Google发言人何塞-卡斯塔涅达说。"Gmail的垃圾邮件过滤器反映了用户的行为。我们为竞选活动提供培训和指导，我们最近为政治相关发件人推出了一个经联邦选举委员会批准的试点，我们将继续努力最大限度地提高电子邮件的交付能力，同时尽量减少不需要的垃圾邮件。"


恰逢美国中期选举季节提起的诉讼，是共和党针对技术公司的更大努力的一部分，因为他们认为技术公司在网上对他们的政党有错误的偏见。


去年，前总统特朗普曾宣布对Facebook和Twitter等公司提起集体诉讼。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[谷歌和苹果的短信标准对抗再次升级

iPhone 的短信应用 iMessage 不支持现代的 RCS 标准，因此，从 iPhone 发往安卓的短信只能采用古老的 SMS 标准。RCS 是 2008 年推出的旨在取代 SMS 的短信标准，支持更丰富的功能。它和 iMessage 一样，其信息是通过互联网传递，而不是通过电信运营商。为了使 iPhone 也能支持先进的 RCS 规范，安卓不断向苹果施压，甚至专门做了一个页面，上面有一些按钮可以让用户给苹果的 Twitter 发消息敦促它。但是苹果就是一无所动。现在，就像 iPhone 发往安卓的短信一样，当安卓用户用表情符对 iPhone 发来的短信做出回应时，iPhone 用户收到的短信不是显示该表情符，而是对该表情符的文字描述，如“爱心”这样的文字。


消息来源：Insider



老王点评：说到底，是苹果觉得支持 RCS 对它没好处，而迫使用户都用它的 iPhone。




开源网络安全监控平台 Zeek 成为 Windows 的一部分

发布于 1998 年的 Zeek（最初名为 Bro）正在被整合到 Windows 中，成为微软 Defender 的一部分，“现在已经部署在全球超过 10 亿个端点上。”Zeek 可以将网络流量转化为紧凑和高保真的日志、文件内容和行为分析，以加快安全操作。Zeek 的创始人称，“我从未想过我开发的网络监控工具会在防御端点方面找到更广泛的应用 —— 但这是开源开发的创造性魔法的一部分”。


消息来源：Corelight



老王点评：微软对采用开源软件方面毫无心理障碍，凡是好的都会想办法拿到 Windows 里面。




苹果宣布下周起更多广告将进入应用商店

苹果宣布从 10 月 25 日开始，在除中国以外的所有国家，与应用程序相关的广告将开始出现在苹果应用商店的主“今日”标签和单个应用程序列表底部的“您可能也喜欢”部分。这是开发者首次能够在“今日”标签上投放广告。“您可能也喜欢”的广告是增加实际“应用税”的另一种手段，迫使开发者在自己的应用页面上购买广告，以避免其他人将客户从自己手上引导走。苹果应用商店的广告以前只限于基于关键词的搜索结果和搜索标签的“建议”部分。苹果希望在未来将其目前的广告收入增加近三倍，达到每年至少 100 亿美元。


消息来源：MacRumors



老王点评：所以，就像 WIRED 说的那样，苹果现在是一家广告公司。]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[这是在 GNOME 文件应用中以 root 身份访问文件或目录的最简单方法。




在 Windows 中，你通常可以在右键单击上下文菜单中以“以管理员身份打开”的方式打开文件或文件夹。

该功能是文件管理器的一部分，对于 Windows，它是 Windows 资源管理器的一部分。但是，它是由操作系统及其权限控制模块执行的。

在 Linux 发行版及其文件管理器中，情况略有不同。不同的桌面有自己的处理方式。

由于以管理员（root）身份修改文件和文件夹是有风险的，并且可能导致系统损坏，因此用户无法通过文件管理器的 GUI 轻松使用该功能。

例如，KDE Plasma 的默认文件管理器（Dolphin）最近 添加了此功能，因此当需要 root 权限时，它会通过 PolicyKit KDE Agent（polkit）窗口询问你，如下所示。



而不是相反的方式。比如，你想在文件管理器中通过 root 打开/执行一些东西时，你不能使用 sudo dolphin 以 root 权限运行文件管理器本身。

在某种程度上，它挽救了许多不可预见的情况。但是高级用户总是可以通过终端使用 sudo 来完成他们的工作。

GNOME 文件应用（Nautilus）和对文件、目录的 root 访问权限

话虽如此，GNOME 文件应用（又名 Nautilus）有一种方法可以通过 root 打开文件和文件夹。

以下是方法：


打开 GNOME 文件应用（Nautilus）。

然后单击左侧窗格中的“其他位置Other Locations”。

按 CTRL+L 调出地址栏。

在地址栏中，输入下面的内容并回车。
admin:///



它会要求输入管理员密码。当你成功验证，你就会以管理员身份打开系统。

现在，从这里开始，无论你做什么，它都是管理员或 root。








但是，与往常一样，请小心你作为管理员所做的事情。在你以 root 身份验证自己之后，通常很容易忘记。

这些选项不容易看到总是有原因的，以防止你和许多新的 Linux 用户破坏他们的系统。

祝好。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[自 Copilot 首次亮相以来，Butterick 就对该计划提出了批评。


微软在 2018 年支付 75 亿美元收购了 GitHub，此后将这个代码仓库整合到其开发者工具中，同时在很大程度上采取了放手的态度。Matthew Butterick 是一名作家、律师，也是一名程序员，他认为微软基于机器学习的代码助手 GitHub Copilot 存在一些问题，它似乎不正确地对待开源代码许可证。

GitHub Copilot 是 Visual Studio 和其他 IDE 的一个插件，通过在你输入时提供代码完成的 “建议” 来运作。Codex 是该系统的动力源。然而，Butterick 等开发者认为 AI 在如何学习方面存在问题，或者更具体地说，AI 是从哪里训练的。

这里的问题是，GitHub 所训练的公开代码仓库是有许可证的，当他们的工作被利用时，需要按照许可证进行。虽然微软对其使用代码的问题一直避而不谈，称其为合理使用，但 Copilot 除了提供建议外，还能生成逐字逐句的代码部分。

根据 Codex（由微软授权）的开发者 OpenAI的说法，“Codex 是在数以千万计的公开代码仓库中训练出来的，包括 GitHub 上的代码。”微软自己也含糊地将训练材料描述为数十亿行的公共代码。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Like probably many of you, I'm kind of a perfectionist coder/creator. Recently I'd been bookmarking interesting dark mode sites just because I liked their aesthetic, and because for some of the SaaS I want to make, I wanted to make it dark mode first rather than light mode like most sites, so I was looking for inspiration.
I'd amassed around 20-30 and I told my friends about these cool sites yesterday. They mentioned that me linking to each one was kind of annoying and they wanted to see all of them at once, similar to how Awwwards and other web design inspiration directories worked. I thought a making a dark mode directory was a great idea as I could just link one site to my friends rather than bombarding them with links.
I'd previously worked on other projects but I always spent too long…]]></summary>

I built and launched Sendfly for myself 5 years ago and it's been a rock solid service that I've relied on ever since.
Recently I've done a full re-write, simplifying the product and making it super affordable. I wanted to share it here in case it comes in handy for someone else.
There are lots of competitors out there but I found them too expensive for my needs. For $15/year you get unlimited forms and 5,000 form submissions every year. Hoping that fits the bill for developers like me!

 I am aware of timeshift which can be used to take snapshots of file system partition (root partition). But I dont see it useful for non-root partitions like for separate home partition or any other btrfs partition.
 Do we have any backup tool with gui which can be used to create btrfs snapshots of non-root data partitions ?
 I am using Ubuntu 22.04 desktop with separate root and home partitions on my ssd. Both partitions are btrfs filesystem.

I’ve been using Virtualbox with Ubuntu and CentOS to try to learn this while reading the LPIC 101 book along with taking a Udemy course. I understand a lot, but there’s some things that I’m not quite understanding. I am being thrown all of this information at once and some of it is confusing me as it feels like I’m missing the fundamentals of it somehow. It’s a lot to take in as I’ve only used windows OS my entire life. I am going to attempt to do a dual boot on my windows desktop with RHEL tonight, but once I have it up and running, I’m not sure what to actually do to help me learn outside of the exercises in this book. Any tips to help as my job depends on being comfortable with and able to efficiently use Linux? Anything at all (things to try to do, videos that may have helped things click with you, etc.) would be GREATLY appreciated. TIA
 Thank you all for your pointers! I’m following all of this advice.

微软准备发布 Windows 的安卓子系统（WSA）的 1.0 版本，它可以运行安卓虚拟机，安卓应用就像 Windows 的应用一样运行。通过 WSA 可以运行 “50,000 个应用程序”，但是这些应用程序来自于亚马逊的应用商店，而不是谷歌的安卓商店。也就是说你找不到谷歌的安卓应用，微软的也找不到，Twitter、WhatsApp、Slack 等等都没有，只有各种游戏和一些看起来就山寨的应用。


消息来源：The Register



老王点评：理论上也是可以运行其它商店的安卓应用的，但是我不明白的是，为什么微软非要和亚马逊的商店合作。




利用智能手机预测死亡风险

根据一项研究，智能手机对人们行走活动的被动监测可以用来构建健康和死亡风险的人群水平模型。研究人员利用英国生物银行项目中超过 10 万名英国人的数据进行了 16 年的研究，他们佩戴的运动传感器可以用来从短时间的步行中提取步行强度的信息。该团队仅利用传感器收集的每天 6 分钟的稳定行走数据，结合传统的人口统计学特征，就成功验证了死亡风险的预测模型。研究人员的模型预测一年后的死亡有 72% 的正确率。


消息来源：Yahoo



老王点评：所以其实我们自身的“大数据”早已经“决定”了命运？




谷歌上线软件供应链管理项目 GUAC

谷歌与花旗银行、普渡大学等合作开发了这个项目，其简称 GUAC 代表“理解工件构成的图形”。这是一个免费的工具，用于汇集许多不同来源的软件安全元数据。GUAC 有四个关键功能：连接到各种软件安全元数据的来源来收集数据；从软件的上游数据源导入各种数据；整理这些数据，将其组合成一个连贯的图谱；对照组装好的图谱，用户可以查询附属于图中实体或与之相关的元数据。


消息来源：Record



老王点评：这个项目或许可以将软件供应链管理变得科学化，但是这个事情很复杂，想要真正解决，可能还需要更多的其它措施。]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The kernel thread “kswapd” is the background page-out daemon of Linux (swaps processes to disk). You can see the creation of the kernel thread in the source of the kernel — https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/latest/source/mm/vmscan.c#L4642. In the code we can see that a dedicated instance of “kswapd” is created for each NUMA zone (on my Ubuntu 22.10 VM I have only “kswapd0” — as shown in the screenshot below).
 Overall, the goal of the “kswapd” is to reclaim pages when memory is running low. In the old days, the “kswapd” was woken every 10 seconds but today it is only wakened by the page allocator, by calling “wakeup_kswapd”
 (https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/latest/source/mm/vmscan.c#L4555). The code of the page allocator is located at “mm/page_alloc.c” (https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/latest/source/mm/page_alloc.c).
 Basically, “kswapd” trickles out pages so the system has some free memory even if no other activity frees up anything (like by shrinking cache). Think about cases in which operations work in asynchronous contexts that cannot page things out.
 The major function which is called by “kswapd” is “balance_pgdat()” (https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/latest/source/mm/vmscan.c#L4146). In order to see that process happening we can use the following bpftrace one-liner: “sudo bpftrace -e ‘kfunc:balance_pgdat { printf(“%s:%d\n”,curtask->comm,curtask->pid); }’” — You can see “kswapd0” calling it in the screenshot below. The flow of “kswapd” is based on limits, when to start shirking and “until when” to shrink (low and high limits).
 See you in my next writeup ;-)
 ​
 sudo bpftrace -e ‘kfunc:balance_pgdat { printf(“%s:%d\n”,curtask->comm,curtask->pid); }’

美国著名小说家托马斯·沃尔夫的处女作（也是让他声名鹊起的作品）《天使望故乡》手稿多达 3000 页，发掘他才华的编辑珀金斯，最终让他删去了九万余字。在他们合作沃尔夫的第二部作品《时间与河流》时，编辑修改文稿的时间长达两年。
如果说一部作品的闪光依靠作者在写作时的天才迸发，那么修改文章的环节，则能让作品变得成熟、完善，禁得住时间的考验。
如果你是少数派的作者，可以写完初稿之后，找少数派的「热心编辑」来审稿，指出修改方向。但是作为文章的署名人，我们必须学会自己修改文章，一方面可以与编辑更理性、深入地交换修改意见，而不是单纯依赖自己对文字的直觉，另一方面也能让作者在修改把握文章的走向，确保自己的写作本意没有在修改环节中丢失。
其实修改文章并没有什么新鲜的招数，完全可以看作对文章写作流程的一次「重做」。从修改所涉及的范围，我们建议可以从以下三个层次来对文章进行修改：
检查文章主题；
调节行文节奏；
改善语言风格。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[本新手教程展示了在 Debian、Ubuntu 和其他的 Linux 发行版上如何解决 “Bash: command not found” 这一报错。


当你在 Linux 中使用命令时，你希望得到终端输出的结果。但有时候，你会遇到终端显示“命令未找到command not found”这一报错。



对于这个问题，并没有直截了当且单一的解决方案。你必须自己做一些故障排除来解决这个报错。

老实说，要解决它并不难。该报错信息已经给出了一些提示：“命令未找到”，这说明你的 shell（或者 Linux 系统）找不到你输入的那条命令。

shell（或 Linux 系统）找不到命令，有三个可能的原因：


你将命令的名称拼错了

该命令还没有安装

该命令是一个可执行脚本，但其位置未知


接下来，我们会详细介绍“命令未找到”这一报错的每一个原因。

解决“命令未找到”报错

方法 1：再次检查命令名称有没有写错

每个人都会犯错误，尤其是在打字的时候。你输入的命令可能存在错别字（也就是你写错啦）。

你应该特别注意：


是否拼对了正确的命令名称

是否在命令与其选项之间加上了空格

是否在拼写中混淆了 1（数字 1）、I（大写的 i）和 l（小写的 L）

是否正确使用了大写字母或者小写字母


看看下面的示例，因为我写错了 ls 命令，所以会导致“command not found”报错。



所以，请再次仔细确认你输入得对不对。

方法 2：确保命令已安装在你的系统上

这是“命令未找到”错误的另一个常见原因。如果命令尚未安装，则无法运行该命令。

虽然在默认情况下，你的 Linux 发行版自带安装了大量命令，但是不会在系统中预装 所有的 命令行工具。如果你尝试运行的命令不是一个流行的常用命令，那么你需要先安…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[你设法在你的 Ubuntu 系统上安装了谷歌 Chrome 浏览器。现在你想知道如何让浏览器保持更新。


在 Windows 和 macOS 上，当 Chrome 上有可用更新时，你会在浏览器中收到通知，你可以从浏览器中点击更新选项。

Linux 中的情况有所不同。你不会从浏览器更新 Chrome。你要使用系统更新对其进行更新。

是的。当 Chrome 上有可用的新更新时，Ubuntu 会通过系统更新工具通知你。



你只需单击“立即安装Install Now”按钮，在被提示时输入你的帐户密码并将 Chrome 更新到新版本。

让我告诉你为什么会在系统级别看到更新，以及如何在命令行中更新谷歌 Chrome。

方法 1：使用系统更新更新谷歌浏览器

你最初是如何安装 Chrome 的？你从 Chrome 网站 获得了 deb 安装程序文件，并使用它来 在 Ubuntu 上安装 Chrome。

当你这样做时，谷歌会在你系统的源列表中添加一个仓库条目。这样，你的系统就会信任来自谷歌仓库的包。



对于添加到系统中的所有此类条目，包更新通过 Ubuntu 更新程序集中进行。

这就是为什么当 Google Chrome（和其他已安装的应用）有可用更新时，你的 Ubuntu 系统会向你发送通知。



单击“立即安装Install Now”按钮并在要求时输入你的密码。很快，系统将安装所有可升级的软件包。

根据更新偏好，通知可能不是立即的。如果需要，你可以手动运行更新程序工具并查看适用于你的 Ubuntu 系统的更新。



方法 2：在 Ubuntu 命令行中更新 Chrome

如果你更喜欢终端而不是图形界面，你也可以使用命令更新 Chrome。

打开终端，并依次运行以下命令：

sudo apt update

sudo apt --only-upgrade install google-chrome-stable


第一条命令更新包缓存，以便你的系统知道可以升级哪些包。

第二条命令 仅更新单个包，即谷歌 Chrome（安装为 google-chrome-stable）。

总结

如你所见，Ubuntu 比 Windows 更精简。你会随其他系统更新一起更新 Chrome。

顺便一提，如果你对它不满意，你可以了解 从 Ubuntu 中删除 Google Chrome。

Chrome 是一款不错的浏览器。你可以通过 使用 Chrome 中的快捷方式 来试验它，因为它使浏览体验更加流畅。

在 Ubuntu 上享受 Chrome！

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[My claim is certainly contentious, but read me out first. One of the things I absolutely hated (and hackers and malware creators loved) was to hunt online for the .exe file of the software I needed to install on windows. For example, my bread-and-butter is basically R and LaTeX. Now I used to use Linux Mint and then shifted to MXLinux. If I try to install these software from the repositories, they would be very outdated (Mint worse than MX). I have to go online, download the .tar files and build everything from the instructions. I could try adding some random repo link to my repo-list and hope that it is updated and maintained. 
 You could argue saying I should switch to an Arch-based distro. I have tried. Base Arch was a bit advanced though I managed it for six months before things got really confusing. I switched to Manjaro and things crashed almost every four weeks.
 Why is there is dichotomy between having moderately new (not even bleeding edge) software, and having a stable operating system?
 As you can guess, I am no power user and NOT a computer programmer/scientist.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This kernel thread is part of the CPU hotplug support. It enables physically removing/adding CPUs on a specific system. There is one kernel thread per vCPU, and the pattern of the thread’s name is “cpuhp/N” (where N is the id of the vCPU) - as can be seen in the screenshot below. Also, today the CPU hotplug can be used to resume/suspend support for SMP (Symmetric Multiprocessing). 
 If we want our kernel to support CPU hotplug the CONFIG_HOTPLUG_CPU should be enabled (it’s supported on a couple of architectures such as: MIPS, ARM, x86 and PowerPC). The kernel holds the current state for each CPU by leveraging “struct cpuhp_cpu_state” (https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/latest/source/kernel/cpu.c#L65).
 We can configure the CPU hotplug mechanism using sysfs (/sys/devices/system/cpu). For example we can shut down and bring up a CPU by writing “0” and “1” respectively to the “online” file in the directory representing the CPU (for which we want to change the status) - checkout the screenshot below (the Linux VM I am testing on has 3 vCPUs).
 In order to bring the CPU down the function “cpu_device_down” (https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/latest/source/kernel/cpu.c#L1225) is called. In order to bring up a CPU function “cpu_device_up” (https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/latest/source/kernel/cpu.c#L1439) is called.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[All memory accesses in a BPF program are
statically checked for safety using the 
verifier, which analyzes the program in its
entirety before allowing it to run. While this allows BPF programs to
safely run in kernel space, it restricts how that program is able to use
pointers. Until recently, one such constraint was that the size of a memory
region referenced by a pointer in a BPF program must be statically known
when a BPF program is loaded. A recent
patch set by Joanne Koong enhances BPF to support loading programs with
pointers to dynamically sized memory regions.]]></summary>

I read about drastic staff / product cuts and re-focusing on the company, however that was always told from the outside.
Was someone working at Apple during that transition and has any interesting stories / can share their experience?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[根据《华盛顿邮报》获取的文件，全球首富马斯克（Elon Musk）在收购社交平台推特（Twitter Inc）之后，将在收购完成的几个月内，裁退将近75%的推特现有员工。对此，Twitter告知员工，没有全公司范围内的裁员计划。


报道说，马斯克向他的推特收购计划潜在投资者说，当他在10月28日完成推特收购计划之后，会把推特的员工人数从目前的7500人，大幅度削减到2000多人。


这个备受全球瞩目的推特收购交易，已经被美国法官下令必须在10月28日之前敲定。美国法官给马斯克铁定的交易完成日期，就是要消除这项440亿美元巨额交易再次出现时断时续的变数。


也是电动车巨头特斯拉（Tesla）首席执行官的马斯克才刚刚在星期三（10月19日）特斯拉的季度业绩发布会上，承认他以过高的价格收购推特，但他仍对即将收购推特而感到兴奋无比。


当时马斯克还把推特描述为一个“憔悴”了很长时间的资产。他说：“我和其他投资者现在显然是以过高价格收购推特。但在我看来，推特的长期潜力比它当前价值要高出许多。”


10月21日早间消息，据报道，今日早些时候，有消息称，特斯拉CEO埃隆·马斯克（Elon Musk）在收购Twitter公司的交易中告诉潜在投资者，现在Twitter有员工7500多人，他准备裁掉约75%，留下2000多人。对此，路透(Reuters)周四晚间援引一位看到相关邮件的消息人士的话报道，Twitter首席法律顾问Sean Edgett周四向员工发送了一封邮件，称没有大规模裁员计划。

Quick list of features:
  - Workspaces
  - Tabs
  - Nested Folders
  - Lots of context menus
  - Response history
  - Plugins
  - Runs fully in the browser and runs offline if necessary
  - Chrome and Firefox extension to bypass CORS restrictions
  - Desktop builds for all platforms
  - GraphQL support
  - Import collections exported from Postman and Insomnia
  - Simple user friendly interface

If you're tired of Postman's bloated interface and slow startup times, do give this a try.

In addition to its national missions, the RTT150 telescope is also working in collaboration with the Spectrum-Röntgen-Gamma (SRG) Space Observatory on an international project. Dr. Hamitoğlu explains the reason why Linux and open source systems are preferred in the whole world of astronomy: “In astrophysics, we may need to write instant programs from time to time in order to process and make sense of the data obtained during observations.

今天想必是个好日子，Ubuntu Linux 22.10 & OpenBSD 7.2 都选在今天发布。我们先来看看 Ubuntu 22.10，这个版本不是 LTS 版本，其代号为 “Kinetic Kudu”，意思是 “充满活力的捻角羚”。不过，22.10 除了升级到 GNOME 43 之外，并没有什么特别值得关注的新特性。而对于 OpenBSD 7.2，最值得关注的是支持了 Ampere Altra 处理器，这个处理器在 Linux 上取得巨大成功后，BSD 也在加紧提供对它的支持。

老王点评：没什么好说的，喜欢试用新版的尝个鲜吧。




LoongArch 成为第四个进入 UEFI 上游的 ISA

2022 年 9 月初，UEFI 官方在新发布的 UEFI v2.10 规范中，全面支持了龙芯处理器的 LoongArch64 架构，以及部分 LoongArch32 架构。近期，龙芯团队又完成了 LoongArch 基础代码与UEFI 上游 TianoCore EDK2 的合并，从而进入其主分支，成为继 x86、Arm、RISC-V 之后，第四个官方支持的芯片指令系统架构。合并后，开发者可以直接从上游获取 LoongArch 架构的基础代码，有助于 LoongArch 虚拟机开源。

RIAA 将 AI 混音器列为新出现的版权威胁

美国唱片业协会（RIAA）在其最新的市场概述报告中，将几个 “基于 AI” 的混音器和提取器被添加为一个新出现的威胁。RIAA 称，“有一些在线服务，据称使用人工智能，从录音中提取，或者说，复制人声、乐器或乐器的某些部分，和/或生成、后期处理或重新混合录音，使其与选定的知名录音艺术家的参考曲目非常相似或几乎一样好。” RIAA 将这种破坏原始的受版权保护的曲目创造衍生作品的做法视作侵权。它提及的 Songmastr 可以根据知名音乐艺术家的风格 “后期处理” 任何歌曲，该网站的底层技术基于开源的 Matchering 2.0。


消息来源：TorrentFreak



老王点评：AI 会逐渐侵蚀各种原有的版权边界，我觉得版权相关法规需要正视 AI 的出现带来的变化，而一昧的封堵是没意义的。]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Have you ever wanted a quick way to call a syscall (even if it is not exposed by libc)? There is a quick way of doing that using “ctypes” in Python.
 We can do it using the “syscall” exported function by libc (check out ‘man 2 syscall’ for more information or the following link — https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/syscall.2.html). By calling that function we can call any syscall by passing its number and parameters.
 How do we know what the number of the syscall is? We can just check https://filippo.io/linux-syscall-table/. What about the parameters? We can just go the the source code which is pointed in any entry of a syscall (from the previous link) or we can just use man (using the following pattern — ‘man 2 {NameOfSyscall}’, for example ‘man 2 getpid’).
 Let us see an example, we will use the syscall getpid(), which does not get any arguments. Also, the number of the syscall is 39 (on x64 Linux). You can check the screenshot below for the full example. By the way, the example was made with https://www.tutorialspoint.com/linux_terminal_online.php and online Linux terminal (kernel 3.10).

在这次采访中，我见到了笔记软件 Joplin 的创建者 Laurent Cozic。Joplin 是 20i 奖励的赢家，所以我想了解是什么让它如此成功，以及他如何实现的。

你能概述一下什么是 Joplin 吗？

Joplin 是一个开源的笔记软件。它可以让你捕获你的想法并从任何设备安全地访问它们。

显然，还有很多其他的笔记应用，那么除了免费使用之外，它还有什么不同呢？

对我们的许多用户来说，它是开源的这一事实是一个非常重要的方面，因为这意味着没有供应商对数据的封锁，而且数据可以很容易地被导出并以各种方式访问。

我们还关注用户的安全和数据隐私，特别是端到端加密同步功能，以及通过对应用的任何连接保持透明。我们还与安全研究人员合作，以保证软件更加安全。

最后，Joplin 可以通过几种不同的方式进行定制 —— 通过插件（可以添加新的功能）和主题来定制应用程序的外观。我们还公开了一个数据 API，它允许第三方应用程序访问 Joplin 的数据。


相关阅读：5 款 Linux 上的笔记应用


这是一个竞争非常激烈的市场，那么是什么激发了你创建它的想法？

这是有原因的的。我从 2016 年开始研究它，因为我不喜欢现有的商业记事应用程序：笔记、附件或标签不能轻易被其他工具导出或操作。

这主要是由于供应商的封锁，另外还有供应商缺乏动力，因为他们没有动力帮助用户将他们的数据转移到其他应用程序。还有一个问题是，这些公司通常会以纯文本形式保存笔记，而这有可能造成数据隐私和安全方面的问题。

因此，我决定开始创建一个简单且具有同步功能的移动和终端应用程序，使我的笔记能够轻松地在我的设备上访问。之后又创建了桌面应用程序，项目从此开始…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Snap 是由 Ubuntu 的母公司 Canonical 设计的通用包格式。有些人不喜欢 Snap，但它有一些优势。

通常，某些应用仅以 Snap 格式提供。这为你提供了在 Arch Linux 中启用 Snap 的充分理由。

我知道 AUR 拥有大量应用，但 Snap 应用通常直接来自开发人员。

如果你希望能够在 Arch Linux 中安装 Snap 应用，你需要先启用 Snap 支持。

有两种方法可以做到：


使用 AUR 助手启用 Snap 支持（更简单）

通过从 AUR 获取包，手动启用 Snap 支持


让我们看看怎么做。

方法 1、使用 AUR 助手启用 Snap

Snap 支持在 Arch 用户仓库中以 snapd 包的形式提供。你可以使用 AUR 助手轻松安装它。

有 许多 AUR 助手，但 yay 是我更喜欢的，因为它的语法类似于 pacman 命令。

如果你还没有安装 AUR，请使用以下命令安装 Yay（需要事先安装 git）：

git clone https://aur.archlinux.org/yay

cd yay

makepkg -si




现在 yay 已安装，你可以通过以下方式安装 snapd：

yay -Sy snapd




每当你 更新 Arch Linux 系统时，yay 都会启用 snapd 的自动更新。

验证 Snap 支持是否有效

要测试 Snap 支持是否正常工作，请安装并运行 hello-world Snap 包。

sudo snap install hello-world

hello-world
（或者）
sudo snap run hello-world




如果它运行良好，那么你可以轻松安装其他 Snap 包。

方法 2、从 AUR 手动构建 snapd 包

如果你不想使用 AUR 助手，你仍然可以从 AUR 获取 snapd。让我展示详细的过程。

你需要先安装一些构建工具。

sudo pacman -Sy git go go-tools python-docutils




完成依赖项安装后，现在可以克隆 snapd 的 AUR 目录，如下所示：

git clone https://aur.archlinux.org/snapd

cd snapd




然后构建 snapd 包：

makepkg -si


当它要求安装其他依赖包时输入 yes。



你已安装 snapd 守护程序。但是，需要启用它以在启动时自动启动。

sudo systemctl enable snapd --now

sudo systemctl enable snapd.apparmor --now #start snap applications

sudo ln -s /var/lib/snapd/snap /snap #optional: classic snap support




手动构建包的主要缺点是每次新更新启动时你都必须手动构建。使用 AUR 助手为我们解决了这个问题。

总结

我更喜欢 Arch Linux 中的 pacman 和 AUR。很少能看到不在 AUR 中但以其他格式提供的应用。尽管如此，在某些你希望直接从源获取它的情况下，使用 Snap 可能是有利的，例如 在 Arch 上安装 Spotify。

希望本教程对你有所帮助。如果你有任何问题，请告诉我。

 I have used Linux for years for servers and development environments, but just recently converted my home gaming desktop to Pop! OS. The software store gives me options of installing software as Flatpak or .deb (from repository).
 What are the advantages of installing software using Flatpak's vs using packages from the distribution or developers repository?
 Am I wrong to think it would always be better to install from the maintainers repository? Wouldn't patches / new versions be available quicker through official repos?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The most used reference implementation is for Python, probably CPython. It is written in C and Python and includes an interpreter and a compiler (for Python bytecode). There is no built-in JIT (Just in Time Compiling) for CPython (meaning it does not compile the code to machine instructions for a specific CPU).
 On the other hand, there is PyPy which is another implementation of Python that supports JIT (and thus is faster — look at the example shown in the screenshot below). Based on different benchmarks done by the PyPy team it seems that it is 4.7X faster than CPython (https://speed.pypy.org/).
 The crazy thing about it is that you don’t need to rewrite the code. The only thing that needs to be done is to replace CPython with PyPy. It is important to know that PyPy supports most of the tools that are part of the “Python Echosystems”. Examples for that are pip (package manager) and virtualenv (Python’s virtual environment). Even most of the Python packages are supported — but not all of them (you can see a list of supported packages by PyPy in the following link — http://packages.pypy.org/).
 Also, the way in which PyPy resembles HotSpot (Java Virtual Machine JIT engine). It uses the dynamic information from the execution of the Python code in order to identify things like the types of objects being in use (and based on that optimizes the compiled code). Let’s say we have a function that uses only two types of objects, then PyPy can create machine code that handles only them.
 Moreover, you should remember that PyPy is not a “Python Compiler” and does not support AOT (a head of time compilation). If you want to learn more about a “Python Compiler” checkout “Numba” (https://numba.pydata.org/).
 Finally, there is also Pyjion which based on its website is “A drop-in JIT Compiler for Python 3.10” (https://www.trypyjion.com/). We will be covering it on a separate writeup. See you next time ;-).

世界上大约 7000 种已知的语言中，40% 没有文字。这给现代机器学习翻译系统带来了问题，因为它们通常需要在翻译到新语言之前将口头语言转换为书面文字，并将文字还原为语音，但 Meta 公司已经通过其最新的 AI 进展解决了这个问题。这个通用语音翻译器（UST）正致力于开发实时的语音到语音的翻译。目前，该系统已经支持讲闽南话的人与讲英语的人交谈。

老王点评：Meta 要是不瞎搞，其实还是很厉害的，能做出很多很不错的技术的。不过，这个功能应该是为其元宇宙准备的。




GitHub Copilot 将微软引向版权风暴

上周，美国德克萨斯 A&M 大学教授 Tim Davis 发现，Copilot 在建议代码时会复制他拥有版权的稀疏矩阵转置代码。有律师宣布调查对 GitHub 提出版权索赔的可能性。以确定 GitHub 是否在开源代码上对 Copilot 进行了不当的训练，以及该工具是否在向用户推荐代码片段时不适当地发出了其他人的版权作品。Copilot 文档警告说，输出可能包含 “不良模式”，并将侵犯知识产权的责任放在 Copilot 的用户身上。


消息来源：The Register



老王点评：不知道微软会不会使用合规的代码重新训练它的 Copilot。




新的 USB-C 规范传输速率最高可达 120Gbps

USB-C 可以支持各种数据传输速率，从 USB 2.0 的 0.48Gbps 到 USB4、Thunderbolt 3/4 的40Gbps。USB-IF 发布了 USB4 2.0 规范，它增加了双向 80Gbps 带宽的支持，以及 120Gbps/40Gbps 的非对称速率的支持。


消息来源：ARS Technica



老王点评：USB 规范的名字已经晕菜了，只需要关注速率提升了。]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Linux 下查找网关或路由器 IP 地址的 5 种方法。


网关 是一个节点或一个路由器，当连接到同一路由器时，它允许两个或多个 IP 地址不同的主机相互通信。如果没有网关，它们将无法相互通信。换句话说，网关充当接入点，将网络数据从本地网络传输到远程网络。在本指南中，我们将看到在 Linux 和 Unix 中从命令行找到默认网关的所有可能方法。

在 Linux 中查找默认网关

Linux 中有各种各样的命令行工具可用于查看网关 IP 地址。最常用的工具是：ip、ss 和 netcat。我们将通过示例了解如何使用每种工具查看默认网关。

1、使用 ip 命令查找默认网关

ip 命令用于显示和操作 Linux 中的路由、网络设备、接口和隧道。

要查找默认网关或路由器 IP 地址，只需运行：

$ ip route


或者：

$ ip r


或者：

$ ip route show


示例输出：

default via 192.168.1.101 dev eth0 proto static metric 100 
172.17.0.0/16 dev docker0 proto kernel scope link src 172.17.0.1 linkdown 
192.168.1.0/24 dev eth0 proto kernel scope link src 192.168.1.20 metric 100


你从输出中看到了 default via 192.168.1.101 这一行吗？它就是默认网关。我的默认网关是 192.168.1.101。

你可以使用 -4 参数只显示 IPv4 网关：

$ ip -4 route


或者，使用 -6 参数只显示 IPv6 网关：

$ ip -6 rou…]]></summary>

Even though Apple is closed today and more tightly integrated within their ecosystem, they are still liked more by the Linux community than Microsoft. I am curious to know why that is the case and why there is such a strong distaste for Microsoft even to this day.
 I would love to hear various views on this! Thank you to those who do answer and throw your thoughts out! :)

《每个 Java 程序员都应该知道的 97 件事：专家的集体智慧》




《每个 Java 程序员都应该知道的 97 件事：专家的集体智慧97 Things Every Java Programmer Should Know: Collective Wisdom from the Experts》


编辑：Kevlin Henney 和 Trisha Gee

由 Seth Kenlon 推荐

这本书是由 73 位在软件行业工作的不同作者共同撰写。它的优秀之处在于它不仅仅适用于 Java 编程。当然，有些章节会涉及 Java，但是也还有一些其他话题，例如了解你的容器环境、如何更快更好地交付软件、以及不要隐藏你的开发工具，这些适用于任何语言的开发。

更好的是，有些章节同样适用于生活中的问题。将问题和任务分成小的部分是解决任何问题的好建议；建立多样化的团队对所有合作者都很重要；由从散乱的一块块拼图到拼好的完成品，看起来像是拼图玩家的思路，也适用于不同的工作角色。

每章只有几页，总共有 97 个章节，你可以轻松跳过不适用于你自己的章节。无论你是一直在写 Java 代码、或者只是学过一点 Java，亦或是尚未开始学习 Java，对于对代码和软件开发过程感兴趣的极客来说，这都会是一本好书。

 I know counterfactuals like this are pretty much pointless, but I'm curious about how different Linux was to its competitors in that era.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If someone were to build a Linux system with proprietary, private (undocumented) ISA extensions, how would they do it given Linux is open source? Are there any examples of this being done? Would it be possible at all?
 I got inspiration from this (https://github.com/corsix/amx) and I wondered if someone has done it before on a Linux-based system. I understand a userspace library could be created to access those instructions from userspace, but how would then they be implemented in the kernel? Through a proprietary kernel module built using a custom compiler? Or is that not needed at all and the library could just run on the processor taking advantage of the proprietary extensions?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Unlike many other architectures, x86 systems support atomic operations that
affect more than one cache line.  This support comes at a cost, though, in
terms of overall system performance and, even, security.  Over the last few
years, kernel developers have worked to discourage the use of this sort of
"split-lock" operation.  Now, though, one group of users is feeling
a little too discouraged, leading to a discussion of how much misery can
appropriately be inflicted upon users who use problematic but
architecturally legal operations.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[倪光南院士称中国自研芯片应押注 RISC-V

近日，中国工程院院士倪光南在《数字世界专刊》撰文指出，目前国内多种国产 CPU 架构并存，未来可能会造成资源分散，低水平重复。如果不能及时改变这种状况，若干年后，中国将缺乏能在全球市场上与 x86 和 ARM 两家竞争的 CPU 架构，从而在“主流 CPU”方面仍将受制于人。倪光南建议，大力发展壮大 RISC-V 产业生态，加大对 RISC-V 开源社区的贡献以增大社区话语权，形成 x86、ARM 和 RISC-V 三分天下的格局。

老王点评：👍 倪院士真是不怕得罪人，铁骨铮铮的老人。




Windows 终端已成为 Windows 11 默认终端

一直以来，命令提示符一直是 Windows 的默认终端。微软宣布，从 Windows 11 22H2 开始所有命令行应用将默认用 “Windows 终端”打开。Windows 终端是微软在 2019 年宣布的开源命令行终端，源代码发布在 GitHub 上。它支持多标签、Unicode 和 UTF-8 字符、GPU 加速文本渲染引擎，定制主题、样式和配置。


消息来源：微软



老王点评：👏 微软的这个终端真不错，可以和 Linux 上最好的终端相媲美。微软是不做开源软件则以，一做动辄就是精品啊。




开源相机库 libcamera 发布首个正式版本

libcamera 是“一个用于 Linux、安卓和 ChromeOS 的复杂的相机支持库”，已经开发了好几年了。相机是复杂的设备，需要大量的硬件图像处理操作，其处理控制算法是在相机中的专用 MCU 或主机的 CPU 中处理。相机设备和 Linux 之间的界限模糊，常常使用户除了使用供应商特定的闭源解决方案外没有其他选择。libcamera 在媒体社区与业界的合作中诞生的，以解决这种问题。

老王点评：🎉 第一个正式版本号非常遵循开源传统，0.0.1。]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[这是 Xubuntu 22.10 Kinetic Kudu 及其新功能的快速总结。




质量需要时间来建立。它适用于生活的各个方面，包括软件。

自 Xfce 4.16 发布以来，Xfce 4.17（开发版）已经被添加了许多新功能。这包括核心 Xfce、原生应用，GNOME 43、MATE 1.26 和 libadwaita。由于 Xfce 也是 GNOME 和 MATE 的组合，正确地合并和测试这些更改需要时间。

在 Xubuntu 22.10 Kinetic Kudu 版本中，你将体验到自 2020 年 12 月以来所做的所有改进：将近两年的错误修复和增强。

让我们快速查看一下时间表。目前，Xubuntu 22.10 beta 已经发布，并正在测试中（本问末尾提供了 ISO 链接）。最终版本预计于 2022 年 10 月 20 日发布。

Xubuntu 22.10 新功能

核心更新和 GNOME 框架

在其核心，Xubuntu 22.10 同其基于的 Ubuntu 22.10 一样，采用 Linux 内核 5.19。另外，Xfce 桌面版本是 Xfce 4.17。

4.17 版本是一个开发版，因为它是下一个大版本 Xfce 4.18 的基础，该版本 计划在今年圣诞节发布。

让我们谈谈 GNOME 和相关应用。 Xubuntu 22.10 中的 Xfce 4.17 首次获得了带有 GNOME 43 更新的 libadwaita。这意味着默认的 GNOME 应用程序可以在 Xfce 桌面下正确呈现。

这就是说，GNOME 软件应用Software 43 在 Xubuntu 22.10 的 Xfce 桌面下看起来很棒。如果你将其与 Xfce 原生外观和带有 CSD/SSD（例如 “磁盘应用Disk”）的 GNOME 应用进行比较，它…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ftrace (function tracer) is a tracing framework which allows tapping into the execution flow of the kernel (it was first merged in 2008). By using that we can examine the behavior of the kernel and learn about its inner workings. Ftrace is based on two types of probes: static (which is added at compile time) and dynamic (injected into the kernel code at runtime).
 When the kernel is compiled using gcc with the flags “-pg”, this will make gcc add machine instructions to the prologue for each non-inlined function. This code will redirect the execution flow to the ftrace’s trampolines/tracer’s plugin (they will run the tracing code we want). By the way, “-pg” generates extra code which writes profile information needed for the analysis programs “prof” (“-p”) or “gprof” (“-pg”).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[微服务遵循领域驱动设计（DDD），与开发平台无关。Python 微服务也不例外。Python3 的面向对象特性使得按照 DDD 对服务进行建模变得更加容易。本系列的第 10 部分演示了如何将用户管理系统的查找服务作为 Python 微服务部署在 Kubernetes 上。

微服务架构的强大之处在于它的多语言性。企业将其功能分解为一组微服务，每个团队自由选择一个平台。

我们的用户管理系统已经分解为四个微服务，分别是添加、查找、搜索和日志服务。添加服务在 Java 平台上开发并部署在 Kubernetes 集群上，以实现弹性和可扩展性。这并不意味着其余的服务也要使用 Java 开发，我们可以自由选择适合个人服务的平台。

让我们选择 Python 作为开发查找服务的平台。查找服务的模型已经设计好了（参考 2022 年 3 月份的文章），我们只需要将这个模型转换为代码和配置。

Pythonic 方法

Python 是一种通用编程语言，已经存在了大约 30 年。早期，它是自动化脚本的首选。然而，随着 Django 和 Flask 等框架的出现，它的受欢迎程度越来越高，现在各种领域中都在应用它，如企业应用程序开发。数据科学和机器学习进一步推动了它的发展，Python 现在是三大编程语言之一。

许多人将 Python 的成功归功于它容易编码。这只是一部分原因。只要你的目标是开发小型脚本，Python 就像一个玩具，你会非常喜欢它。然而，当你进入严肃的大规模应用程序开发领域时，你将不得不处理大量的 if 和 else，Python 变得与任何其他平台一样好或一样坏。例如，采用一种面向对象的方法！许多 Python 开发人员甚至可能没意识到 Python 支持类、继承等功能。Python 确实支持成熟的面向对象开发，但是有它自己的方式 -- Pythonic！让我们探…]]></summary>

 He's running Linux as a parallel installation on his gaming rig (and I'm using Linux daily for the last couple of decades). But I was thinking after we get the hardware running we could make it into a server with services, will give me a good excuse to introduce him to SSH and remote access. 
 Any tips or ideas for fun services to install on it? I'm thinking file server on the network, perhaps a Webb server for his own website (remember when we used to hack html in notepad 😅).
 But I have a feeling there's got to be some other really fun ideas for what we could do other than that with the hardware. Bring on the ideas!

 But why?
 Libvirt-lxc was the best thing ever happened to SLES. We were able to run complete SAP systems (w/ 2-3TB database) within LXC containers on bare metal performance. 
 They say "as a replacement, we recommend commonly used alternatives like Docker or Podman." 
 Thank you, it helps a lot.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Since its inclusion in the Linux kernel, the WireGuard VPN tunnel has become
increasingly popular.  In general, WireGuard is simpler to configure than
other VPNs, but the approach that it takes to authentication can present
some challenges. Each node in a WireGuard network has a cryptographic key
that serves as the node's identity; 
nodes that do not know each other's keys cannot directly communicate.
Keeping
track of these keys and distributing them to the other nodes
in a mesh network quickly becomes a chore as the network grows.
Fortunately, there are now 
several open-source 
tools that can automate the management of these keys and make using
WireGuard easier for both administrators and end users.]]></summary>

Today we are open-sourcing Linen and launching Linen communities. You can now create a community on Linen.dev without syncing it from Slack and Discord!
I initially launched Linen as a tool to sync Slack and Discord conversations to a search engine-friendly website. As I talked to more community managers, I quickly realized that Slack and Discord communities don't scale well and that there needs to be a better tool, especially for open-source knowledge-based communities. Traditionally these communities have lived on forums that solved many of these problems. However, from talking to communities, I found most of them preferred chat b…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello,
 So I do some freelancing work here and there though word of mouth since I live in a small town where nobody knows what a computer is.
 One of the places I hang out at is a cafeteria where they have a cheap ass 15year old laptop or something like that. It ran windows, but kept crashing as far as I know everyday.
 I respected the owners since his kids are good friends of mine (he is an old folk) so I offered to try to fix it for free since he says he does not have any money to invest in getting a new one.
 I know for a fact that's BS since the whole family including their grandmother has the latest iPhone but I digress, just wanted to do a decent thing.
 I am pretty sure the laptop hard drive has just gone nuts since many times it just would not save things (i have used it in the past) and I am afraid I was not aware of what I was getting into.
 I installed antiX on a live USB and just plugged it in, wrote with the help of one of their employees(another good friend of mine) some instructions on how to setup their speakers to play music.
 I had explained to him the laptop is dead and all I am doing is giving it one last breath until HE NEEDS to get a new one.
 He is calling me in pretty much everyday, because nobody knows how to use any non windows gui.
 I do not blame them its not their job to spend 10minutes every day enabling the speakers
 And he does treat them unfairly for the most part being paid less 3.5 euros an hour and all
 But I did this as a favor and now he is complaining to me, wanting me to come and fix his shit, for free, I even gave them my usb...
 I just dont know how to deal with these people. How do you explain to somebody that either learn the damn thing or get a new laptop and leave me the hell out of it.
 This is a chaotic and maybe offtopic post but i dont know where else I can vent about something linux related and well, yeah. Sorry I guess.

 Good morning to all the guys viewing my post,
 Recently, I have been working on creating a minimalistic & highly extensible browser inspired from qutebrowser, min, surf and badwolf browsers and to solve the problems which I have encountered with qutebrowser, Though I like qutebrowser and also it is really great project and solves a lot of the problems but the two problems I faced made me to start this project
 The 1st being that when I add a new tab in qutebrowser it goes back to normal which might sound but it hinders productivity as I have to again and again press \"i\" to go back to insert mode which is not good.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[FFmpeg 是第一个干掉专有竞争软件的大规模开源软件

FFmpeg 被描述为多媒体的瑞士军刀。它集成了数百个视频、音频和图像解码器和编码器、多路复用器和解复用器、过滤器和设备。FFmpeg 是第一个在其细分市场上完全消除了专有软件的大规模 FOSS 项目之一。几乎所有的多媒体相关公司都依靠 FFmpeg 来完成他们的重任。在多媒体方面，FFmpeg 几乎是所有问题的解决方案。如果它不是，你更有可能去修补 FFmpeg，而不是去开发新的东西。顺便说一句，FFmpeg 的创始人 Fabrice Bellard 也是 QEMU 的创始人。


消息来源：Drew DeVault



老王点评：FFmpeg 简直是垄断性的成功。说起这个来，我记得有几家公司被列入了其耻辱榜。




Electron 上运行的 Windows 95 发布新版本

发布于 27 年前的 Windows 95 虽然早已停止支持，但仍被一些人认为是微软创造的最伟大的产品之一。有爱好者使用 Electron 开发了名为“Windows 95”复刻版应用，借助该框架，它可以在 Windows、macOS 和 Linux 上运行。该应用刚刚发布了最新版本 3.1.1，得益于底层框架 Electron 从 v18 升级到 v21，它带来了一些重大变化，比如支持最新的 Chromium 106，支持深色模式。


消息来源：GitHub



老王点评：当年第一次见到 Windows 95，那种震撼是只用过 DOS 和 Windows 3.1 的我不能想象的。




比特币网络花了一个半小时才产生了一个区块

根据区块浏览器的数据，最近比特币网络开采出的两个区块间隔了 85 分钟，有超过 13,000 笔交易被积压。上周，比特币经历了一次难度调整，以确保区块确认每 10 分钟进行一次。随着采矿难度飙升至 35.6 万亿，开采比特币的成本变得更高。闪电网络的创始人说，在不考虑难度变化的情况下，每隔 34 天会发生一次 85 分钟区块间隔。


消息来源：Coindesk

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[在本指南中，我们将逐步介绍如何在 Linux 中创建 LVM 分区。


LVM 代表 “逻辑卷管理Logical Volume Management”，它是专门为服务器管理 Linux 系统上的磁盘或存储的推荐方式。 LVM 分区的主要优点之一是我们可以实时扩展其大小而无需停机。 LVM 分区也可以缩小，但不推荐。

为了演示，我在我的 Ubuntu 22.04 系统上连接了 15GB 磁盘，我们将从命令行在该磁盘上创建 LVM 分区。

准备


连接到 Linux 系统的原始磁盘

具有 sudo 权限的本地用户

预装 lvm2 包


事不宜迟，让我们深入了解这些步骤。

步骤 1、识别新连接的原始磁盘

登录到你的系统，打开终端并运行以下 dmesg 命令：

$ sudo dmesg | grep -i sd


在输出中，查找大小为 15GB 的新磁盘。



识别新连接的原始磁盘的另一种方法是通过 fdisk 命令：

$ sudo fdisk -l | grep -i /dev/sd


输出：



从上面的输出，可以确认新连接的磁盘是 /dev/sdb。

步骤 2、创建 PV（物理卷）

在开始在磁盘 /dev/sdb 上创建物理卷Physical Volume（PV）之前，请确保已安装 lvm2 包。如果未安装，请运行以下命令：

$ sudo apt install lvm2     // On Ubuntu / Debian
$ sudo dnf install lvm2    // on RHEL / CentOS


运行以下 pvcreate 命令在磁盘 /dev/sdb 上创建 PV：

$ sudo pvcreate /dev/sdb

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[LURE 是一个新的开源项目，它希望成为所有发行版的 AUR。




AUR（Arch 用户仓库Arch User Repository）是一个由社区驱动的基于 Arch 的 Linux 的发行版仓库。

简而言之： 它可以帮助你安装官方仓库中没有的软件包，并让你获得最新的版本。

我发现它对我在 Manjaro Linux 上的体验很有帮助。

从技术上讲，AUR 从源头构建一个软件包，然后利用软件包管理器（pacman）来安装它。

你也可以在我们的详细指南中探索更多关于它的信息。


什么是 AUR？ 如何在 Arch 和 Manjaro Linux 中使用 AUR？


📢 现在你对 AUR 有了一个基本的了解，有一个 新的开源项目 旨在将 AUR 的功能带到所有的发行版中。

这个项目被称为 “Linux 用户仓库Linux User REpository”（LURE）。


💡 LURE 项目正处于 alpha 阶段，由创建者在几周前宣布。所以，它完全是一个正在进行的工作。


已经有这样的项目了？



没有。

开发者们已经尝试做一个 AUR 的替代品，但是是针对特定的发行版。就像 makedeb 软件包仓库 是针对 Debian 的。

LURE 是一个雄心勃勃的想法，可以在你选择的任何发行版上工作。

它试图成为一个帮助你使用类似于 PKGBUILD 的脚本为你的发行版创建原生软件包的工具。


创建 PKGBUILD 为 Arch Linux 制作软件包


开发者在 Reddit 公告帖子 中提到了一些技术细节：


我的项目叫 LURE，是 “Linux 用户仓库”的简称。它构建原生软件包，然后使用系统软件包管理器安装它们，就像 AUR 一样。它使用一个类似于 AUR 的 PKGBUILD 的构建脚本来构建软件包。

它是用纯 Go 语言编写的，这意味着它在构建后没有任何依赖性，除了一些特权提升命令（sudo，doas 等等）和任何一个支持的软件包管理器，目前支持 pacman、apt、apk（Alpine Linux 上，不是安卓）、dnf、yum 和 zypper。


听起来很棒！


LURE 项目Repo


你也可以在它的 GitHub 镜像 上探索更多信息。

使用 LURE

你不必安装一个额外的软件包管理器来使它工作，它可以自动与你系统的软件包管理器一起工作。

因此，如果它在其仓库（或任何其添加的仓库）中没有找到一个包，它就会转到系统的默认仓库，并从那里安装它。就像我用 lure 命令在我的系统上安装/移除 neofetch 一样。



虽然该项目处于早期开发阶段，但它为各种发行版提供了 二进制包，以让你安装和测试它们。



目前，它的仓库包括一个来自创建者自己的项目。但你可以尝试添加一个仓库并构建/安装东西。

为了方便起见，我试着在它的仓库中安装软件包。



命令看起来像这样：

lure in itd-bin


在它的 官方文档页面，你可以读到更多关于它在构建/安装/添加存储库方面的用法。

未来版本的一些计划中的功能包括：


自动安装脚本

基于 Docker 的自动测试工具

仓库的网页接口


让它变得更好

嗯，首先，这是一个优秀的项目。如果你是过去使用过 Arch 的人，或者想离开 Arch Linux，这将是一个很好的工具。

然而，对于大多数终端用户和非 Arch Linux 新手来说，像 Pamac GUI 软件包管理器 这样的软件包管理器支持 LURE 应该是锦上添花的。

当然，在目前的阶段，它需要开源贡献者的支持。所以，如果你喜欢这个想法，请随时为该项目贡献改进意见

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A kworker is a kernel thread that performs processing as part of the kernel, especially if case of interrupts, timers, I/O, etc. It is based on workqueues which are async execution mechanisms, that execute in “process context” (I will post on workqueus in more details separately, for now it is all that you need to know).
 Overall, there are a couple of kworkers running on a Linux machine. The naming pattern of kworkers includes: the number of the core on which it is executed, the id of the thread and can contain also string that hints what the kworker does (check the output of ‘ps -ef | grep kworker’ — see the screenshot below).
 ​
 ‘ps -ef | grep kworker’ output
 The big question is — “How do we know what each kwoker is doing?”. It’s a great question, the way in which we are going to answer it is by using ftrace (function tracing inside the kernel — I suggest reading more about that — https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/trace/ftrace.txt). The command we are going to use are:
 echo workqueue:workqueue_queue_work > /sys/kernel/debug/tracing/set_event
 cat /sys/kernel/debug/tracing/trace_pipe > /tmp/trace.log
 The first one enables the tracing regarding workqueus. The second reads the tracing data and saves it to a file. We can also run “cat /sys/kernel/debug/tracing/trace_pipe | grep kworker” and change the grep filter to a specific kworker process. In the trace we will see the function name that each kworker thread is going to execute.

He has been wanting to switch to Linux for a long time and finally decided to make the change yesterday, but we encountered lots of issues first which was BitLocker which we removed, next we have been stuck on raid mode as monjaro won't recognise his internal SSD unless I ran a few commands and figured out that the problem is with the drive being in rapid mode only but each time I change it into ahci it gets changed back to rapid. I have tried all the top hits on google switched to safe mode and then did too still it gets changed back to raid, we decided to take his SSD and add it to another laptop and then we formatted the SSD and installed monjaro on it using that laptop it installed properly and was running smooth, but as we switched back the SSD to his laptop it gets stuck on the monjaro loading screen and doesn't load, would be really helpful if someone could help. We have been stuck on this for 48 hours now. We really want to install monjaro and get rid of windows proprietary stuff

My browsers (firefox, chrome, konqueror) work fine, except when I try to play movies, they don't. I see the first frame, and then the player pauses. It won't unpause. If I press 'play' to try to unpause it, it will shift one frame forward and stop. The 'play' button switches to a 'pause' button as though it were playing. If I press 'pause' again it shifts one frame back - as though switching between two different things, both paused.
 At first I thought it was a firefox bug. So I went to use chrome, then konqueror, to get around it. No dice. They do exactly the same thing. I popped up Gwenview to try to play a movie on my local hard drive and found that it has the same problem. "Thi…]]></summary>

 I want a program that will look for I"m as I'm typing, and if so, hit the backspace button twice, then write 'm instead. It should do this before I hit the next key(or do some sort of buffering) so it doesn't mess anything else up.
 Does a program like this exist?

 Actually I figured it out. AutoKey can do this. I'm very happy with the results

5.5 of the Tor-centered Tails distribution is out.  The biggest change

	Thunderbird 102 also includes important usability improvements to

合成党是今年 5 月丹麦成立的一个新的党派，倡导人类与 AI 的和谐共处。该党派正试图在今年 11 月的丹麦议会选举中赢得一个席位。令人吃惊的是，合成党的公众形象和挂名领袖是一个名叫 Leader Lars 的 AI 聊天机器人。它根据 1970 年以来丹麦各个边缘政党的政策编程，旨在代表 20% 不参加选举的丹麦人的价值观。它通过 Discord 与民众交流。但它不会参与投票。

老王点评：这个党派唯一不足的地方就是，成员还是人类。🤣




AI 专家点评各大 AI

UNDARK 对纽约大学名誉教授 Gary Marcus 进行了采访，在采访中他对当前的几个主流 AI 进行了有趣的点评：GPT-3 “其实是一个自动完成系统，可以预测下一个单词和句子。就像你的手机一样，你输入一些东西，它就会继续。它并不真正理解它周围的世界。”谷歌的 LaMDA “没有知觉，它不知道自己在说什么东西”。无人驾驶汽车“仅仅记住你所见过的大量交通情况并不能表达你真正需要了解的世界”。OpenAI 的 DALL-E “利用了人类的非故意贡献，他们也许已经签署了‘服务条款’协议，但没有认识到这一切会导致什么”。

老王点评：简直把当前热捧的 AI 批评的一无是处，人间清醒啊。




修好了电脑的 Linus Torvalds 呼吁内核开发人员别赶 Deadline

Linus Torvalds 发布了 Linux 内核 6.1 的第一个 rc 版本，对这个版本，Torvalds 说，“不算小，但比过去几个版本小”。内核的每一个新版本都有一个为期两周的合并窗口，“企鹅皇帝”说，“在我把我的机器整理好并赶上合并窗口后，我对各种迟到的拉取请求感到有些沮丧。我以前提到过这个，但是在合并窗口的最后几天收到相当多的拉动请求，这真的很烦人。”然后他抱怨内核开发人员们没有尽早提交代码，不要“在两周内匆匆忙忙地把一个分支放在一起，然后在第二周的星期五发给 Linus。……在截止日期前熬夜完成论文的做法在高中毕业后就应该被淘汰了。你知道我说是谁”。


消息来源:The Register



老王点评：有时候看内核邮件列表里面 Torvalds 每次的邮件也挺有意思的。]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[“亡国与亡天下”，是300多年前的顾炎武提出来的，他在《日知录·正始》中是这样说，“有亡国，有亡天下。亡国与亡天下奚辨？曰：异姓改号，谓之亡国。仁义充塞，而至于率兽食人，谓之亡天下。……知保天下然后知保国。保国者，保君其臣，肉食者谋之；保天下，匹夫之贱与有责焉耳矣。”


“亡国”指的是亡政府，古时候就是亡江山，江山在西周封建制之前是属于诸王的，在秦代帝制之后是属于皇帝的。现代国家是政府管理，政权更迭一般可称为亡国。


“亡天下”指的是文化灭亡，文化产业大幅倒退，文化输出消亡，文化发展停滞甚至被其他文化所取代，最终闭关锁国，直至被世界潮流所淘汰，就是亡天下的标志。


亡天下最终会导致文明的灭亡。文明灭亡的主要标志是文字的灭亡，古埃及、古印度、古巴比伦的文明之所以灭亡，主要因为那三个文明古国的文字都已经失传，现在人基本无法理解那些古国的文字。


正如郑也夫所说的，江山自古属于极少数人，从根本上说，江山在西周封建制之前是属于诸王的，在秦代帝制之后是属于皇帝的。侍奉皇权的官僚可以分到一杯羹。做官数代的家族每每感激涕零地说“世受国恩”。古人说：国家兴亡肉食者谋之，天下兴亡匹夫有责。意思是江山易姓是少数人的事情，文明沦丧才关乎每个人。


所谓“天下兴亡，匹夫有责”，指的是保护一个国家政权，是帝王将相和文武大臣的职责；而民族文化、文明的兴盛、灭亡，则关乎所有人的利益，每一个老百姓都有义不容辞的责任。]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[安装 Arch Linux 有一些挑战性。这就是为什么 有几个基于 Arch 的发行版 通过提供图形化的安装程序使事情变得简单。

即使你设法安装了 Arch Linux，你也会注意到它严重依赖命令行。如果你需要安装应用或更新系统，那么必须打开终端。

是的！Arch Linux 没有软件中心。我知道，这让很多人感到震惊。

如果你对使用命令行管理应用感到不舒服，你可以安装一个 GUI 工具。这有助于在舒适的图形化界面中搜索包以及安装和删除它们。

想知道你应该使用 pacman 命令 的哪个图形前端？我有一些建议可以帮助你。

请注意，某些软件管理器是特定于桌面环境的。

1、Apper



Apper 是一个精简的 Qt5 应用，它使用 PackageKit 进行包管理，它还支持 AppStream 和自动更新。但是，没有 AUR 支持。

要从官方仓库安装它，请使用以下命令：

sudo pacman -Syu apper



GitLab 上的 Apper


2、深度应用商店



深度应用商店是使用 DTK（QT5）构建的深度桌面环境的应用商店，它使用 PackageKit 进行包管理，支持 AppStream，同时提供系统更新通知。 没有 AUR 支持。

要安装它，请使用以下命令：

sudo pacman -Syu deepin-store



Github 上的深度商店


3、KDE 发现应用



发现Discover 应用不需要为 KDE Plasma 用户介绍。它是一个使用 PackageKit 的基于 Qt 的应用管理器，支持 AppStream、Flatpak 和固件更新。

要在发现应用中安装 Flatpak 和固件更新，需要分别安装 flatpak 和 fwupd 包。它没有 A…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[不要做重复的工作；基于浏览器开发 Web App 时，需要制作一些可重用的模块。




Web 组件是一系列开源技术（例如 JavaScript 和 HTML）的集合，你可以用它们创建一些 Web App 中可重用的自定义元素。你创建的组件是独立于其他代码的，所以这些组件可以方便地在多个项目中重用。

首先，它是一个平台标准，所有主流的浏览器都支持它。

Web 组件中包含什么？


定制元素：JavaScript API 支持定义 HTML 元素的新类别。

影子 DOM：JavaScript API 提供了一种将一个隐藏的、独立的 文档对象模型（DOM）附加到一个元素的方法。它通过保留从页面的其他代码分离出来的样式、标记结构和行为特征对 Web 组件进行了封装。它会确保 Web 组件内样式不会被外部样式覆盖，反之亦然，Web 组件内样式也不会“泄露”到页面的其他部分。

HTML 模板：该元素支持定义可重用的 DOM 元素。可重用 DOM 元素和它的内容不会呈现在 DOM 内，但仍然可以通过 JavaScript 被引用。


开发你的第一个 Web 组件

你可以借助你最喜欢的文本编辑器和 JavaScript 写一个简单的 Web 组件。本指南使用 Bootstrap 生成简单的样式，并创建一个简易的卡片式的 Web 组件，给定了位置信息，该组件就能显示该位置的温度。该组件使用了 Open Weather API，你需要先注册，然后创建 APPID/APIKey，才能正常使用。

调用该组件，需要给出位置的经度和纬度：

<weather-card longitude='85.8245' latitude='20.296' />


创建一个名为 weather-card.js 的文件，这个文件包含 Web 组件的所有代码。首先，需…]]></summary>

merge window for this development cycle.


	This isn't actually shaping up to be a particularly large release:
	we "only" have 11.5k non-merge commits during this merge window,
	compared to 13.5k last time around. So not exactly tiny, but
	smaller than the last few releases. At least in number of commits.

	That said, we've got a few core things that have been brewing for a
	long time, most notably the multi-gen LRU VM series, and the
	initial Rust scaffolding (no actual real Rust code in the kernel
	yet, but the infrastructure is there).]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Google has announced
the existence of yet another new operating system, called KataOS, aimed at
the creation of secure embedded systems.


	As the foundation for this new operating system, we chose seL4 as
	the microkernel because it puts security front and center; it is
	mathematically proven secure, with guaranteed confidentiality,
	integrity, and availability. Through the seL4 CAmkES framework,
	we're also able to provide statically-defined and analyzable system
	components. KataOS provides a verifiably-secure platform that
	protects the user's privacy because it is logically impossible for
	applications to breach the kernel's hardware security protections
	and the system components are verifiably secure. KataOS is also
	implemented almost entirely in Rust, which provides a strong
	starting point for software security, since it eliminates entire
	classes of bugs, such as off-by-one errors and buffer overflows.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[黑曜石 1.0 做了重新设计，带来了有价值的新功能。




黑曜石Obsidian 是一款强大的笔记应用，可以用来制作知识图谱，同时还提供 Notion 类似的功能。

在 1.0 更新之前，我们已经有一篇关于它的 详细文章。

黑曜石 1.0 的发布标志着该应用在桌面和移动体验方面的发展迈出了关键一步。


💡 黑曜石不是一个开源的应用程序，但可以在 Linux 上使用。


让我们来看看它的桌面版提供的新功能。

🆕 黑曜石 1.0 的新功能



1.0 版本增加了大量的新功能、主要的视觉变化和错误修复，其中一些亮点包括：


改良的用户界面

新的外观设置

带有标签堆叠的标签功能

大修的主题画廊

各种错误的修复


🎨 用户界面的改造



用户界面已经得到了全面改造，这使得用户体验更加直观和强大。



除此之外，黑曜石现在还有一个专门的外观设置部分。它包含了切换显示内联标题、标签标题栏、改变重点颜色等选项的设置。



带有标签堆叠的标签功能



现在你可以在黑曜石中打开多个标签，并使用热键来帮助你在忙碌的一天中完成多个任务。

一个额外的好处是，即使你退出黑曜石，它也会记住你曾经打开的标签和你在这些标签中的活动状态。



标签也可以分组形成堆叠，并在它们之间进行切换，从而使工作空间变得更加整齐。

🛠️ 其他变化

其他值得一提的变化包括：


改变缩放级别的能力

改进了黑曜石的同步

内存泄漏修复

用于折叠行的折叠命令


你可以通过 发布说明，以及 发布公告 来了解更多的细节。

📥 下载黑曜石 1.0

你可以到 官方网站 下载黑曜石 1.0。在手机上，也可以在谷歌应用商店和苹果的应用商店上找到它。

为 Linux 用户提供了三个软件包：AppImage、Flatpak 和 Snap。

开发者还澄清说，他们不会向个人用户收取黑曜石的使用费。

💬 你对黑曜石 1.0 有什么看法？一个值得替代其他记事本的应用程序吗？

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey HN,
I am a solo founder that just finished writing code for my project (MVP) and am ready to find clients.
- for the sake of the question, my clients will be small physical businesses. Think, Family Doctor's Office, Local Cafe, Small barber, etc.
I will be developing a blog for SEO purposes and doing other things to promote my business online. However, I believe the key to success here will be "Cold Sales". I have never done that before. So, if you could recommend a book, a blog post, other online resources, or you just have a random advice that I could learn from, I would be very thankful.
Suffice it to say I will be starting out ASAP, even though I don't know anything. I believe practice is the best teacher. However, if there are any resources that could help me get up and running quicker that would be awesome. Thanks a ton in advance.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I just learned this from Linus Tech Tips - Link to specific part of the video where this is mentioned.
 Needless to say I think this sucks! I had so much hope for these new GPUs to become a viable alternative to Nvidia. I know that Intel is still working on improving their drivers, but as long as they keep at it, it's just a matter of time before they reach a competitive level. And I suppose we can always hope that they'll change their stance on supporting Linux. 
 What's your take?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[如果，首页分页、分类分页、作者分页、标签分页、日期分页统一采用【*/2/default.html】式网址，URL配置如下。


首页分页【{%host%}/page/{%page%}/default.html】


分类页【{%host%}/category/{%alias%}/default.html】


作者页【{%host%}/author/{%alias%}/default.html】


标签页【{%host%}/tags/{%alias%}/default.html】


日期页【{%host%}/date/{%date%}/default.html】


那么，建议将《c_system_lib.asp》文件的【t=Replace(t,"/default.html","_%n/default.html")】修改为【t=Replace(t,"/default.html","/%n/default.html")】，方可实现统一第2页为【*/2/default.html】式网址。


——按Z-Blog现有的规则生成的【*/alias_2/default.html】式网址不够完美；风觉得完美的网址应该是要么【*/alias/2/default.html】，要么【*/alias/default_2.html】。


但是，上述修改也会导致一个bug：如果首页分页URL配置采用【{%host%}/default.html】，而分类页、作者页、标签页、日期页仍然采用上述配置就会导致页面链接为【*/2/default.html】而实际却是【*_2/default.html】式从而使得链接错误，而这个错误基本不会出现，原因如下文。


经过再三测试：只要首页分页URL配置为【{%host%}/page/{%page%}/default.html】，不管其它页面如何配置，都是正确的；只要首页分页的URL配置与其它分页配置同步（也就是都不采用上述URL配置），也是正确的。所以，建议下一版本将《c_system_lib.asp》修改了吧，没有哪个人将分类页、标签页、作者页、日期页均采用【*/2/default.html】式，而唯独放过首页，不讲武德吧？？


《YTBuild》的lib文件的语句也是将【_】改为【/】也就是【Url=StaticUrlRules("(\/default\.html)",Url,"/"&Index&"$1")】，测试也没问题。


总之，Z-Blog的生成的网址，建议采用【*/2/default.html】式或【*_2.html】式，摒弃那种【*/alias_2/default.html】式。


如果按上述修改lib文件：


那么一个非常完美的网址也是可以实现的，只是切记定好分类，不要随意更改文章的分类，切记！301定向比较麻烦！


1、父类页面：域名/父类别名/


2、子类页面：域名/父类别名/子类别名/


3、文章页面：域名/父类别名/子类别名/文章别名.html


感谢Z-Blog团队，2.3asp确实比2.2修正了很多细节和错误页面。

谷歌本周宣布发布 KataOS，它是用于进行机器学习的嵌入式设备的操作系统。KataOS 从设计上就具备安全考虑，不但几乎完全是由 Rust 实现的，而且是建立在 seL4 微内核的基础之上，seL4 在数学上被证明是安全的，具有保证保密性、完整性和可用性。


消息来源：谷歌



老王点评：谷歌的操作系统之心不死啊，时不时的就发布一个操作系统，然而，Linux 仍然是谷歌用的做到的操作系统。




谷歌搜索 emoji 相关词汇时会报错

有网友发现，在谷歌上搜索“how many emojis on iOS”、“how many emojis on windows” 等内容时，谷歌搜索引擎会极其罕见的报服务器错误：“处理您的请求时，似乎出现了内部服务器错误”。据分析，这是出现在结果中的一个特定网页可能导致了这个错误，很可能是 Emojipedia.com 网站。谷歌已经修复了该问题。


消息来源：Bleeping Computer



老王点评：这真是太罕见了，我是第一次听说谷歌会因为某个搜索结果而导致服务器内部错误。




Pine64 宣布了一款不到 10 美元的 Linux 单板计算机

这款名为 Ox64 的单板计算机有一个双核 RISC-V 处理器，64MB 的嵌入式内存，支持高达 128Mb 的闪存和一个用于额外存储的 MicroSD 卡。预计它将支持 RTOS 和 Linux，模糊了微控制器和极低功率的单板电脑之间的界限。它预计将在 11 月上市销售，RTOS 版本起价为 6 美元，Linux 兼容型号起价为 8 美元。


消息来源：Pine64



老王点评：这个单板机看起来不错，还挺便宜。]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[One of the goals of an operating system is to handle and balance resources across the hardware of the compute. In order to do that, Linux has a kernel thread named “migration” which has an instance on every vCPU. By the way, the naming format is “migration/N” where N is the id of the vCPU.
 By default threads are not constrained to a vCPU and can be migrated between them in the next call to “schedule()” (which call the main scheduler function, which is “__scheduler()” — https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/latest/source/kernel/sched/core.c#L6544). It is done mainly in case the scheduler identifies an unbalanced across the runqueues (the queue in which processes which are in ready/runnable state are waiting to use the processor) of the vCPUs.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[本指南解释了在 Fedora Linux 发行版中启用第三方软件仓库 RPM Fusion 的步骤。


RPM Fusion 软件仓库是一个社区维护的软件仓库，它为 Fedora Linux 提供额外的软件包，这些软件包不是由 Fedora 官方团队分发，例如 DVD 播放、媒体播放、来自 GNOME 和 KDE 的软件等。这是因为许可证、其他法律原因和特定国家/地区的软件规范而导致的。

RPM Fusion 为 Red Hat Enterprise Linux（RHEL）以及 Fedora 提供了 .rpm 包。

本指南介绍了在 Fedora Linux 中启用 RPM Fusion 仓库所需的步骤。本指南适用于所有 Fedora 发行版本。

这在所有当前支持的 Fedora 版本（35、36 和 37）中进行了测试。



如何在 Fedora Linux、RHEL、CentOS 中启用 RPM Fusion 仓库

RPM Fusion 有两种版本的仓库：自由和非自由。

顾名思义，自由版包含软件包的自由版本，非自由版包含封闭源代码的编译软件包和“非商业”开源软件。

在继续之前，首先检查你是否安装了 RPM fusion。打开终端并运行以下命令。

dnf repolist | grep rpmfusion


如果安装了 RPM，你应该会看到如下所示的消息。就不用下面的步骤。如果未安装，你可以继续执行以下步骤。



打开终端并根据你的操作系统版本运行以下命令。请注意，这些命令包含自由和非自由版本。如果你愿意，你可以在运行时省略下面的任何一个。

Fedora

自由版：

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[充分利用 PyLint。


敲黑板：PyLint 实际上很好！

&ldquoyLint 可以拯救你的生命”，这是一句夸张的描述，但没有你想象的那么夸张。PyLint 可以让你远离非常难找到的和复杂的缺陷。最差的情况下，它只可以节省测试运行的时间。最好的情况下，它可以帮你避免生产环境中复杂的错误。

优点

我不好意思说这种情况是多么普遍。测试的命名总是那么奇怪：没有人关心这个名称，而且通常也找不到一个自然的名称。例如以下代码：

def test_add_small():
    # Math, am I right?
    assert 1 + 1 == 3
    
def test_add_large():
    assert 5 + 6 == 11
    
def test_add_small():
    assert 1 + 10 == 11


测试生效：

collected 2 items                                                                         
test.py .. 
2 passed


但问题是：如果你覆盖了一个测试的名称，测试框架将愉快地跳过这个测试！

实际上，这些文件可能有数百行，而添加新测试的人可能并不知道所有的名称。除非有人仔细查看测试输出，否则一切看起来都很好。

最糟糕的是，被覆盖测试的添加、被覆盖测试造成的破坏，以及连锁反应的问题可能要几天、几月甚至几年才能发现。

PyLint 会找到它

就像一个好朋友一样，PyLint 可以帮助你。

So here’s America, composed of several APIs that paint a vivid, real-time picture of a good old-fashioned road trip. Get local classifieds and photos. Tune into local radio stations. Talk wit other drivers.  And more.
Exploring the country by car was an invaluable experience for me during my time in the states. I’ve since moved to Barcelona, and find myself missing the territory. This is my attempt at recreating the magic.

 Demo of `wf`, a UNIX-style program for running commands on file update
 I'm starting to use LaTeX for school, and it bothered me to have to run the compile command every time I saved the document… I could set up compile on save in my editor, but I wanted a simple, reusable, command line for it, and didn't find anything that Just Worked™ how I wanted it to. So I made my own :D
 It supports watching multiple files, and you can use the %F operator in your command to get back the name of the file that was updated!
 There are more examples, and instructions on how to build & run it on the GitHub page!
 There are also many TODOs left in the code, if you know C, feel free to PR with suggestions!
 Edit: thanks to everyone recommending other options! For now, there are none that fit my personal use case, but I do recommend you check them out! Many very interesting project around this kinda stuff!!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Canonical 在 apt 命令中为其 Ubuntu Pro 打广告

之前我们 报道 过，Canonical 公司提供的 Ubuntu Pro 支持现在可供多达五台机器免费使用，为这些机器提供十年的支持服务。这本来是一件好事，但如果你从命令行用 apt 命令更新时，你就会看到 Canonical 发布的宣传这项免费服务的广告。这让一些用户非常恼火。Canonical 在自作主张向 Ubuntu 用户显示广告方面“劣迹斑斑”。上一次在服务器的登录屏幕中显示了促销信息，而在十年前，它还在桌面搜索结果中显示了亚马逊的广告。


消息来源：The Register



老王点评：我觉得，可能 Canonical 的初衷或许是好的，但是这种侵入式广告的方式太糟糕。或许，Ubuntu 应该在其桌面版和服务器版中专门提供一个通告服务，以使关注 Ubuntu 相关信息的人可以主动订阅。




黑客利用无人机，通过 Wi-Fi 远程渗透了金融公司内网

安保人员在美国东海岸一家专注于私人投资的金融公司的大楼顶层发现了两架 DJI 无人机，一架虽然炸机但仍在运行，而另一架实现了安全着陆。两架无人机上被加装了渗透套件，包含一台树莓派、GPD 迷你笔记本电脑、4G 调制解调器、Wi-Fi 设备、几块电池，以及一套网络渗透测试设备。攻击者利用该装置拦截了该公司员工的凭据，利用员工 MAC 地址和访问凭据、从屋顶侵入了该公司的内网。


消息来源：The Register



老王点评：这真是无孔不入，之前曾经有黑客靠近办公室渗透 Wi-Fi 的，现在居然连无人机都用上了。




PostgreSQL 15 发布

新版本进一步改进了性能，主要新特性包括：支持 SQL MERGE 命令；改进内存中和磁盘上的排序性能，最高提升 400%；启用了 Zstd 和 LZ4 压缩支持，并支持写前日志文件；支持 pg_basebackup 期间执行服务器端压缩；等等。


消息来源：Phoronix



老王点评：我当时学习的第一个开源数据库就是 PG，可惜后来它的风头被 MySQL 抢走了，但是实际上 PG 更优秀。]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It offers great out of the box experience, easy installation of drivers, most of the stuff is kept at very current versions. It's also very stable, and hassle-free. Unlike Arch, Solus 's philosophy is to offer an experience that doesn't require manual intervention between updates.
 That also makes it more friendly than Ubuntu, because upgrading between major Ubuntu versions rarely is hassle-free. The only guaranteed way to have a hassle-free experience on Ubuntu, is to do a clean install, whereas Solus is rolling. You install it once, and just update it periodically (new updates are released once a week, usually on Friday / Saturday).
 For me, Solus also feels like the right distribution to start on Linux desktop for a few reasons:
  
Easy Installation. 
 Stable rolling release.
 Easy to use Software Manager without junk or obsolete packages.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[我一直在努力学习关于 IPv6 的相关知识。一方面，IPv6 的基础概念是很简单的（没有足够的 IPv4 地址可以满足互联网上的所有设备，所以人们发明了 IPv6！每个人都能有足够的 IPv6 地址！）

但是当我试图进一步理解它时，我遇到了很多问题。其中一个问题是：为什么 twitter.com 不支持 IPv6。假设，网站不支持 IPv6 并不会造成很多困难，那么为什么网站需要支持 IPv6 呢？

我在 Twitter 上询问了很多人 为什么他们的服务器支持 IPv6，我得到了很多很好的答案，我将在这里总结一下。事先说明一下，因为我对 IPv6 基本上毫无经验，所以下面所总结的理由中可能会有写得不准确的地方，请大家多多包涵。

首先，我想解释一下为什么 twitter.com 可以不支持 IPv6，因为这是最先让我困惑的地方。

怎么知道 twitter.com 不支持 IPv6 呢？

你可以使用 dig 命令以 AAAA 的选项查询某一个域名的 IPv6 地址记录，如果没有记录，则表明该域名不支持 IPv6。除了 twitter.com，还有一些大型网站，如 github.com 和 stripe.com 也不支持 IPv6。

$ dig AAAA twitter.com
(empty response)
$ dig AAAA github.com
(empty response)
$ dig AAAA stripe.com
(empty response)


为什么 twitter.com 仍然适用于 IPv6 用户？

我发现这真的很令人困惑。我一直听说因为 IPv4 地址已经用完了，从而很多互联网用户被迫要使用 IPv6 地址。但如果这是真的，twitter.com 怎么能继续为那些没有 IPv6 支持的人提供服务呢？以下内容…]]></summary>

 The purpose of this post is to criticise the Linux community's tendency to blame users for errors caused by misusing "easy" software that wasn't actually easy. This includes downvoting.
 If a user is using something that is presented as an "easy" option or in a way that leads them to reasonably believe that something should be easy but ends up messing it up and nuking their installation, that generally represents a failure in UI design.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've been keeping my eye on btrfs for over 9 years now, eagerly awaiting stability. I built a new PC recently, and figured I'd try out arch + btrfs versus my usual ubuntu LVM setup.
 The btrfs root filesystem irrecoverably failed within a day.
 I set everything up per the arch wiki guidelines. Install worked great, nvidia drivers happily powering my dual monitor setup, all peripherals working. After a few reboots, the system fails to come up with the dreaded error
  parent transid verify failed on 414318592 wanted 33555976 found 1544 
 We had some fun errors like this thrown in as well:
  btrfs errno=-5 IO failure 
 I tried the full gamut of btrfs rescue zero-log, btrfs rescue super-recover, btrfs scrub --rescue and so much more. Ultimately, the filesystem is just dead. What's interesting is I didn't go any crazy hardware stupidity like unplugging the drive or hard power resets. It. Just. Died.
 I know that Suse uses btrfs, so maybe I just "got unlucky". Then again, I have over 12 years of linux devops experience, and this was a brand new fresh install on a pristine samsung 980 Pro NVME drive. The lack of recovery options made this quite painful.
 I lost a full day and a half of debugging, time I'll never get back. I'd like to try the latest and greatest, but honestly at this point I just need a stable working system.
 Sadly, it seems that btrfs is just not there yet.
 /rant
  
Edit: folks are pointing out that this is a hardware problem. Both smartctl and nvme-util report zero issues and perfect health. What are some other ways to check the NVME drive?

 Remember when Firefox was awesome?
 In the early 2000's Microsoft launched Internet Explorer 6, and it was fancier and shinier than the previous version. I had been a Windows user since Windows 3.1 and this was by far the best update in the Windows ecosystem... but then it came along Firefox, advocating for web standards, tabbed browsing, themes, and a faster engine. It was glorious!
 Prior to HTML5, those were the days of the ActiveX, Adobe Flash, and sometimes Java applets, but truth be told, ActiveX websites looked very obsolete even by those days standards. ActiveX did not work well with Firefox, but I did not care, because that technology is for old business people anyways and I still got to rip all the aforementioned benefits.

        <id>https://linux.cn/article-15141-1.html?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss</id>
        <link href="https://linux.cn/article-15141-1.html?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss"/>
        <updated>2022-10-15T02:10:45.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[VirtualBox 7.0 是自其上次大版本更新以来的一次重大升级。有一些不错的进步！




对 VirtualBox 来说，这是一次大的升级。这个版本值得关注，因为我们在最近几年没有看到过它的大版本更新。

对于那些不熟悉 VirtualBox 的人来说，它是一个由 甲骨文公司 开发的虚拟化软件。

随着 VirtualBox 7.0 的推出，增加了许多新功能。

让我们来看看其中最关键的一些。

VirtualBox 7.0 的新内容



VirtualBox 7.0 是一次有益的升级。有图标更新、主题改进，以及一些关键的亮点，包括：


一个显示运行中的客体Guest的性能统计的新工具。

支持安全启动。

支持全加密虚拟机Full VM Encryption（通过 CLI）。

重新设计的新建虚拟机向导。


通过命令行管理的全加密虚拟机

虚拟机（VM）现在可以完全加密了，但只能通过命令行界面。

这也包括加密的配置日志和暂存状态。

截至目前，用户只能通过命令行界面对机器进行加密，未来将增加不同的方式。

新的资源监控工具



新的实用程序可以让你监控性能统计，如 CPU、内存使用、磁盘 I/O 等。它将列出所有正在运行的客体的性能统计。

这不是最吸引人的补充，但很有用。

改进的主题支持

对主题的支持在所有平台上都得到了改进。在 Linux 和 macOS 上使用原生引擎，而在 Windows 上，有一个单独的实现。

对安全启动的支持

VirtualBox 现在支持安全启动，增强了对恶意软件、病毒和间谍软件的安全性。

它还将防止虚拟机使用损坏的驱动程序启动，这对企业应用非常重要。

使用那些需要安全启动才能运行的操作系统的用户现在应该能够轻松创建虚拟机了。

其他变化

VirtualBox 7.0 是一次重大的升级。因此，有几个功能的增加和全面的完善。

例如，新件虚拟机向导现在已经重新设计，以整合无人值守的客体操作系统安装。



其他改进包括：


云端虚拟机现在可以被添加到 VirtualBox，并作为本地虚拟机进行控制。

VirtualBox 的图标在此版本中得到了更新。

引入了一个新的 3D 栈，支持 DirectX 11。它使用 DXVK 来为非 Windows 主机提供同样的支持。

支持虚拟 TPM 1.2/2.0。

改进了多显示器设置中的鼠标处理。

Vorbis 是音频录制的默认音频编解码器。


你可以查看 发行说明 以了解更多信息。

如果你正在寻找增强的功能，如更好的主题支持、加密功能、安全启动支持和类似的功能添加，VirtualBox 7.0 是一个不错的升级。

💬 你对这次升级有什么看法？你会使用较新的版本还是暂时坚持使用旧版本的虚拟机？

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[​
 https://reddit.com/link/y4920k/video/kdpeoseqzut91/player
 ​
 Plasma 5.26 added support for animated wallpapers, the following animated image formats are supported: ani, avif, avifs, gif and webp.
 In the video above I'm using WebP, I resized the image to the native resolution of my display, which is 2560x1080, file size is 2.7MiB. When the wallpaper can be seen on the screen, plasmashell uses 1.9% of my CPU (Core i5-12400), when you maximize the window it drops to 0%, so it's fairly lightweight and shouldn't affect performance when windows are maximized or fullscreen.
 Thanks to the devs for implementing this feature.

 When is AMD going to step up and improve this awful driver??? It’s been almost 2 years and they don’t even support the 6700 XT which I use. What does it take for them to do something about this? Best part too? You can’t even use the open source source drivers with their shitty ROCM driver, you’re FORCED to use the worse closed source drivers that break every kernel update.
 It’s a pain to install, it doesn’t work well. Libraries are not as performant as their Nvidia counterparts. Why has it been years and they still don’t give a shit about the productivity workspace??
 https://github.com/RadeonOpenCompute/ROCm
 What can we as a community do? Nvidia is literally the only way I can be productive in machine learning and anything that requires GPU computing. I literally have to just succumb to Nvidia’s drivers and their products if I want to do something productive on my computer. Literally have to put up with the bad guy because the “good” guy can’t make a good product

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In college I did a month long experiment where I only used my computer's terminal emulator to do all my work. I wrote my code/notes in Vim, browsed the web with elinks, and wrote my emails using mutt. It was a great learning experience.
Recently I looked into doing this again and ran into a bunch of issues:
- My company uses Slack's enterprise auth, and all the CLI slack clients I could find haven't been updated in years and no longer work.
- The web is using more javascript than in the past.
- Mutt doesn't handle multiple email accounts natively for work/personal. The solutions are hacks at best. Email servers are starting to use more complete auth mechanisms that don't work well with mutt.
It seems like the terminal world is slowly getting abandoned in favor of proprietary GUI apps. Anyone still living inside the terminal? Links to tools for Slack are appreciated.

公开资料显示，腾讯地图是腾讯公司提供的一项互联网地图服务，覆盖全国近400个城市。通过腾讯地图，用户可以查询银行、医院、宾馆、公园等地理位置，帮助用户找到地理位置相关的生活服务，如美食、汽车服务、旅游等，还提供公交换乘查询方式和驾车导航规划功能。


2013年12月，腾讯旗下SOSO地图正式更名为腾讯地图，自此和百度地图、高德地图开始竞争。2021年9月，搜狗宣布与腾讯完成合并，成为腾讯控股间接全资子公司。2022年5月15日，搜狗地图宣布下线，关闭所有相关服务，并建议用户下载腾讯地图。


而在2022年5月11日，成立于1999年的搜狗地图在官网发布通知。“搜狗地图将于2022年5月15日23时正式下线，届时关闭所有相关服务。请下载腾讯地图为您提供更好的服务。”


目前，位于前三的高德地图、百度地图和腾讯地图活跃用户分别是4.77亿、3.89亿以及3354万。随着腾讯地图的这一决定，PC端地图就仅剩百度地图和高德地图。

strongly in the area of codecs — code that creates or plays back audio
or video that has been compressed using covered algorithms.  For this
reason, certain formats have simply been unplayable on many Linux
distributions — especially those backed by companies that are big
enough to be worth suing — without installing add-on software from
third-party repositories.  One might think that this problem could be
worked around by purchasing hardware that implements the patented algorithms,
but recent activity in the Fedora and openSUSE communities shows that life
is not so simple.]]></summary>

微软宣布了基于 OpenAI 的 DALL-E 2 模型的应用 Designer。用户可通过输入文字提示生成一系列图像。Designer 有免费版和付费版，将提供给微软 365 个人和家庭订阅用户。目前 Designer 作为一个免费的 Web 应用供公众测试和获取反馈，类似的技术将整合到 Edge 浏览器和 Bing 搜索引擎中。

老王点评：AI 图像生成已经势不可挡，虽然目前还有一些道德瑕疵，但是这总是能解决的。




GNU 工具链考虑将其基础设施转移到 Linux 基金会

GNU 工具链是 GNU/Linux 生态系统、云和嵌入式环境的基石。红帽公司资助的 SourceWare.org 多年来一直在托管 GNU 工具链的大部分基础设施，但最近有提议将其基础设施转移到 Linux 基金会提供的 IT 服务下。Linux 基金会的 IT 服务将管理 Git 存储库、邮件列表、错误跟踪器、网站、CI/CD 以及相关的基础设施。GNU 工具链的领导层已经正式表态支持这一提议。


消息来源：Phoronix



老王点评：这件事 Linux 基金会做的不错，毕竟有专门的组织来负责维护，总比红帽员工兼职维护更可靠些。毕竟，现在这种基础软件的安全一旦动摇，影响的范围已经不仅仅是个人爱好者了。




Debian GNU/Linux 14 代号已确定为“Forky”

Debian 方面今天宣布，计划 2027 年发布的 Debian 14 将被称为 “Forky”。Debian 的代号是以《玩具总动员》系列中的玩具命名的。即将在 2023 年发布的 Debian 12 代号为“Bookworm”，而 2025 年发布的 Debian 13 的代号是 “Trixie”。


消息来源：Phoronix



老王点评：不知道《玩具总动员》中有多少个的有名字的玩具，要是用完了怎么办。]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[如果你在搜索引擎中输入“ARPANET”，搜索相关图片，你会看到许多地图的图片，上面是这个上世纪六十年代末七十年代初 美国政府创建的研究网络，该网络不断延伸扩展，横跨了整个美国。我猜很多人第一次了解到 ARPANET 的时候都看过这种地图。

可以说，这些地图很有意思，毕竟我们很难想象过去连接网络的计算机是那么少，就连如此低保真的图片都可以表示出美国全部机器的所在位置（这里的低保真lo-fi指的是高射投影仪成像技术，而不是大家熟知的 lo-fi 氛围音乐）。不过，这些地图是有问题的。地图上用加粗的线条连接着大陆各地，强化了人们的一种观念：ARPANET 最大的贡献就是首次将横跨美国东西两地的电脑连接了起来。

今天，即便是在病毒肆虐、人们困居家中的情况下，网络也能把我们联系起来，可谓是我们的生命线。所以，如果认为 ARPANET 是最早的互联网，那么在那之前世界必然相互隔绝，毕竟那时还没有今天的互联网，对吧？ARPANET 首次通过计算机将人们连接起来，一定是一件惊天动地的大事。

但是，这一观点却与历史事实不符，而且它也没有进一步解释 ARPANET 的重要性。

初露锋芒

华盛顿希尔顿酒店坐落于国家广场National Mall东北方向约 2.4 千米处的一座小山丘山顶附近。酒店左右两侧白色的现代化立面分别向外延展出半个圆形，活像一只飞鸟的双翼。1965 年，酒店竣工之后，《纽约时报》报道称这座建筑物就像“一只栖息在山顶巢穴上的海鸥” [1]。

不过，这家酒店最有名的特点却深藏在地下。在车道交汇处下方，有着一个巨大的蛋形活动场地，这就是人们熟知的国际宴会厅International Ballroom，多年来一直是华盛顿特区最大的无柱宴会厅。1967 年，大门乐队在此举办了一场音乐会。1968 年，“吉他之神”吉米·亨德里克斯也在此举办了一场音乐会。到了 …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[近期，京东金融发布通知，京东金融APP转账功能将于10月29日起逐步停止服务，停止服务前不影响用户正常使用相关功能。


据了解，转账功能是京东金融APP推出的收付款业务，拥有转账到银行卡（从个人借记卡转账到个人借记卡）和转账给朋友两种转账方式。


转账服务分为两小时内到账（夜间部分银行最晚4个小时内到账）和次日到账。该业务依托京东科技旗下非银支付机构网银在线（北京）科技有限公司提供服务。


QuestMobile数据显示，截至2021年12月末，京东金融活跃用户人数为3834.91万人，活跃渗透率为3.27%。


在综合理财领域，京东金融APP的用户活跃度位居行业前列，但在非银支付领域，其用户活跃数量相较微信支付等头部机构仍有较大差距。


目前，银行APP个人转账普遍免收服务费用，而非银支付平台超过一定转账金额往往需要收取一定比例的服务费用。


根据京东金融平台业务说明，2019年11月15日起，同一用户每月最高可享有1万元的免费转账额度，超出部分将按照0.15%收取服务费。


资料显示，京东金融是京东数字科技集团旗下个人金融业务平台，已推出白条、基金、银行理财、小金库、金条、联名小白卡、小金卡等金融产品，涵盖理财、借贷、保险、分期四大业务板块。


近日，京东金融旗下另一业务京东众筹亦宣布关闭。


10月8日，京东众筹宣布自10月10日起暂停运营。据了解，京东众筹入口已于9月30日10时下线，已经上线的项目不受影响。京东众筹为京东金融旗下业务板块之一，于2014年7月1日推出。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After explaining about PID 1, now we are going to talk about PID 2. Basically, kthreadd is the “kernel thread daemon”. Creation of a new kernel thread is done using kthreadd (We will go over the entire flow). Thus, the PPID of all kernel threads is 2 (checkout ps to verify this). As explained in the post about PID 1 (init) the creation of “kthreadd” is done by the kernel function “rest_init” (https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/latest/source/init/main.c#L680 — shows the source code). There is a call to the function “kernel_thread” (after the creation of init).
 Basically, the kernel uses “kernel threads” (kthreads from now on) in order to run background operations. Thus, it is not surprising that multiple kernel subsystems are leveraging kthreads in order to execute async operations and/or pe…]]></summary>

the 6.1 release, but one of the changes that has received the most
attention will also have the least short-term effect for users of the
kernel: the introduction of support for the Rust programming language.  No
system with a production 6.1 kernel will be running any Rust code, but this
change does give kernel developers a chance to play with the language in
the kernel context and get a sense for how Rust development feels.  Perhaps
the most likely conclusion for most developers, though, will be that there
isn't yet enough Rust in the kernel to do much of anything interesting.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Cofounder of Obsidian here. We're excited to announce Obsidian 1.0 is live!
Obsidian 1.0 introduces two big changes: a UI overhaul and an new tabbed interface. We've put a lot of care into making the app more approachable and more accessible. We've also prioritized using more native OS features for menus, windows, and many details.
We got our first private beta users from a comment under a HN thread about org-roam [1], and our waiting list was an innocent Google Form. Good times!
Our initial launch on HN was over two years ago [2], when terms like "second brain" and "tools for thought" were still in their infancy. Since then, the landscape has continued to evolve and new ideas are sprouting in the space every day. Obsidian has always embraced its "hacker" nature and thrives off its community of tinkerers. We now have over 670 plugins that push the envelope of what's possible in the app.
We want to continue to foster that same hacker spirit, but at the same time, we want to provide a polished product that can stand on its own. In the last several months, we've expanded the team and refocused ourselves on providing a product that's polished and easy to use.
We have big plans to continue making Obsidian the best and most refined thought-processing app for decades to come. Obsidian 1.0 is just the start!
Special credits go to Stephan Ango (@kepano) for the redesign and Liam Cain for tirelessly polishing this release.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Firefox OS 复活

Firefox OS 是 Mozilla 在 2013 年创建的安卓替代品，并于 2016 年放弃了它。2018 年，在 Firefox OS 基础上曾出现了一个令人失望的 KaiOS，主要针对功能机市场的商业操作系统，但它是封闭的，还会跟踪用户并且有广告。现在，Capyloon 项目决定复活 Firefox OS，将其带到现代 Linux 智能手机上。该项目还处于早期阶段。它能运行旧的 Firefox OS 应用。目前可以在安卓设备上通过启动谷歌通用系统镜像（GSI）测试其 UI。


消息来源：Tux Phones



老王点评：本来可能成为 Mozilla 的一个基石型项目，非常可惜被放弃了，我认为放弃 Firefox OS 是 Mozilla 的一大败笔。不过，新的复活计划是否能真正复活 Firefox OS，还需要拭目以待，毕竟，时代不同了。




国产编译器项目 LambdaChip 捐赠给 HardenedLinux

开放硬件整体方案 LambdaChip 是为数不多的国产编译器项目，其背后的公司正式破产清算，将其项目改名为 Animula，并正式捐赠给 HardenedLinux 社区。LambdaChip 是一个野心勃勃的国产项目，试图在 10KB 内存的单片机上同时支持 Scheme、Lua 5.2 和 Python3 等语言，已经有了一些不错的进展。HardenedLinux 自嘲其“是否成为商业失败的开源项目的集散地的结论为时尚早”，并对此类项目表示了欢迎。


消息来源：Solidot



老王点评：看来 HardenedLinux 成为了一个孤儿项目摇篮。不过，确实需要一些组织来负责照料这些因为种种原因被放弃的项目。




Linux 内核 6.1 放弃火线串口驱动，删除了 4000 行代码

Linux 的 fwserial 驱动程序允许通过 IEEE-1394（火线接口）连接 TTY，以实现对等体之间的有线高速串行连接。但自从该驱动程序在 2012 年被合并以来，没有人负责维护该驱动程序。而且，现在有更好的连接方式，苹果的火线接口越来越没有人使用了。因此，它在 Linux 内核 6.1 中被删除，为内核减少了约 4000 行代码。


消息来源：Phoronix



老王点评：作为一个发展了 30 年的软件项目，其中肯定充斥着大量过时或无用的驱动和代码，因此时不时清理一下也是好的。不过，我觉得或许应该有更明确的规则对内核的各个组成部分设置不同的生命周期。]]></summary>

中国半导体行业协会声明


2022年10月7日，美国商务部以维护国家安全为由宣布了两项新的出口管制规定。


中国半导体行业协会(CSIA)反对美国商务部用如此武断的方式为国际贸易带来干扰。我们非常担心美方将国家安全用于歧视性贸易政策,这种单边性的政策不仅会进一步损害全球半导体行业的供应链，更重要的是，它将形成一个不确定的产业氛围,给过去几十年全球半导体行业从业人员共同耕耘从而打造的互相信任、友好合作精神造成巨大的负面影响。


为了全球半导体行业、为了依赖半导体而发展的多个下游行业，更为了数以百万计的半导体从业人员，我们希望美国政府能及时修正错误的做法，回归世界半导体理事会(WSC）和政府与当局的半导体会议（ GAMS )的国际贸易磋商机制的框架下，能够充分沟通，有效地交换意见，寻求达成共识。


中国半导体行业协会 2022年10月9日]]></summary>

Mostly known as “init”. init is the first Linux user-mode process created, which runs until the system shuts down. init manages the services (called demons under Linux, more on them in a future post). Also, if we check the process tree of a Linux machine we will find that the root of the tree is init.
 There are multiple implementations for init, each of them provide different advantages among them are: SysVinit, launched, systemd, runit, upstart, busybox-init and OpenRC (those are examples only and not a full list). Thus, based on the implementation specific configuration files are read (such as /etc/inittab — SysVinit), different command/tools to manage demons (such as service — SysVinit and systemctl — systemd), and dif…]]></summary>

That decision has been disputed at the next level (sorry I don't know the correct terms in English, assuming the legal systems are similar enough to have a fair translation) who determined that the appeal court didn't apply correctly the law for part of the decision and thus has sent the matter back (text of the decision, you need to understand legal French to make something out of it) to the appeal court for a new trial for the relevant matter. If I'm not mistakent, that decision can be summarized "infringing a license is a copyright violation".

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Brave 是一款出色的类似于 Chrome，但可 替代 Chrome 的网络浏览器。


Firefox 和 Brave 是我喜欢在 Linux 系统上使用的两种浏览器。两者都有不同的优势。

Firefox 比 Brave 做得更好的一件事就是画中画（PIP）模式，它适用于 YouTube、Netflix 和大多数流媒体网站。

Brave 也有画中画模式，但它是如此隐藏，以至于你觉得它根本没有 PIP 支持。

内置画中画适用于某些网站（如 YouTube），但可能不适用于其他网站（如 Prime Video）。不用担心！你可以为此使用专用扩展。

让我在本教程中展示这两种方法。

方法 1：在视频上双击右键

技巧是依次单击两次右键，你应该会看到画中画模式选项。

让我通过一个例子来说明这一点。在 Brave 中播放 YouTube 视频。现在右键单击视频。



再次右键单击。它应该在视频上，但不在上一个上下文菜单上，而在视频的其他地方。

现在你应该看到另一个带有画中画选项的上下文菜单。



选择画中画，视频将从窗口中弹出。你可以将其移动到浏览器中的任何位置。



当你使用其他应用时，你还可以让它在屏幕上的任何位置播放。



在最近的 Brave 版本中，你可以根据自己的喜好调整弹出窗口的大小。

我不明白为什么 Brave 把它隐藏成这样。为什么不突出它？

无论如何，这适用于 YouTube 等网站，但可能不适用于 Prime 视频。如果你愿意，你可以安装一个扩展。

方法 2：使用画中画扩展

谷歌提供了一个官方插件，可让你在谷歌 Chrome 中获得画中画功能。由于 Brave 基于 Chromium，你可以在 Brave 中使用相同的扩展。


画中画扩展


进入扩展页面并点击 “添加到 BraveAdd to Brave” 按钮。



当你单击它时，它会提示添加扩展的选项。



添加扩展后，你应该会在浏览器的右上角看到它。



播放视频时，单击该扩展图标，视频应该会弹出。

你能在 Brave 中启用 PIP 模式吗？

画中画模式已成为休闲流媒体消费的必备功能。我觉得奇怪的是，Brave 和其他浏览器没有足够重视它。 Firefox 处理得很好。

我希望这个快速的小技巧可以帮助你在 Brave 浏览器中获得 PIP 体验。你更喜欢这两种方法中的哪一种？右键单击还是扩展？

基本上，Linux 无处不在，每个人都在谈论它，因此你可能会不自主地陷入到对错失了 “学习 Linux” 的不安中。

所以，你想知道 Linux 的优势是什么，以及它是否值得去学习。

在这篇文章中，我总结了很多 Linux 的优势和劣势。

如果你在选择 Linux 还是你喜欢的操作系统上犹豫不决，我们愿意为你提供一些帮助。


在开始之前，我们要指出的是，“Linux” 本身并不是一个操作系统，它的操作系统被称为 Linux 发行版，而且 Linux 的发行版有数百种。为简单起见，我将其称为 Linux 操作系统，而不是某个特定的 Linux 发行版。可以参考 这篇文章，来更好地理解这些东西。


使用 Linux 的优势

如果你想使用 Linux 替代现在的操作系统，那么只有当你了解 Linux 的优势，才会有意义。

如果 Linux 在你想要它做的事情上表现出色，你将永远都不会后悔你的决定。

不用购买许可证



你需要拥有苹果公司的设备，才能使用 macOS 作为日常使用；你需要拥有 Windows 许可证，才能使用微软的 Windows。

因此，你需要对这些东西进行一定的投资。但是，对于 Linux 呢？它是完全免费的！

与 Windows 和 macOS 相比，不仅仅是操作系统上的不同，Linux 上还有许多免费的软件包。

你无需支付许可证费用，就可以使用所有主流的 Linux 发行版。当然，你可以选择捐赠来支持该…]]></summary>

在今天的 Meta Connect 会议上，微软 CEO 萨提亚·纳德拉表示，该公司正在与 Meta 合作，将其最大的服务，Teams、Office、Windows，甚至 Xbox 云游戏，带到 Meta 的 Quest VR 头盔上。人们将能够直接从 Meta 的 Horizon 工作间加入 Teams 会议，也可以在 Quest VR 头盔里面使用 Windows 365，获得 Windows 的完整体验，包括所有个性化的应用程序、内容和设置。此外，微软还通过 PWA 技术将 Office 应用的 2D 版本带到 Quest VR 头盔。甚至，Xbox 云游戏也将进入 Quest VR 头盔，虽然不会像 Xbox 原生 VR 体验那样令人沉浸，但你将能够拿起 Xbox 控制器，在头盔内的巨大屏幕上玩这些游戏。

老王点评：微软的这一合作，对 Meta 的元宇宙愿景来说可谓一剂强心针。




美国能源科学网络 ESnet6 带宽升至 46Tbps

成立于 1986 年的美国能源科学网络 ESnet，旨在帮助美国能源部的科学家们打通旗下各个实验室，使之能够快速共享大量原始数据。它由横跨全美的 2.4 万公里的专用光缆组成。随着该网络完成 ESnet6 更新，美国最快的互联网带宽也飙升到了 46 Tbps。2021 年的时候，通过 ESnet 网络传输的数据量，就已经达到了惊人的 1.1 EB。不过，在实验性网络中的最高传输速度的记录是日本创造的 1 Pbps，即 1000 Tbps。

新西兰计划对农场动物打嗝、撒尿征税

据央视新闻，新西兰政府 11 日提议对农场动物打嗝、撒尿排放的温室气体征税，以应对气候变化。新西兰政府表示，该项税收是世界首创，将从 2025 年开始征收，税价未定。新西兰约一半的温室气体排放来自农场，包括牛打嗝产生的甲烷和尿液中所含的一氧化二氮。此前，新西兰政府 2003 年提出征收农场动物的“放屁税”计划，遭到农场主反对，最终告吹。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[更新 Linux 系统并没有那么复杂，不是吗？毕竟，要更新 Ubuntu 之类的发行版，你只需要使用 apt update 和 apt upgrade 就行。

如果所有的包都是通过一个包管理器安装的，就会是这样。

但现在情况不再如此。你有经典的 apt/dnf/pacman，还有 Snap、Flatpak、Appimages。不止于此，你还可以使用 PIP（用于 Python）和 Cargo（用于 Rust）安装应用。

使用 Node？ NPM 包需要单独更新。Oh My Zsh？需要单独更新。Vim 中的插件、Atom 等也可能不被 apt/dnf/pacman 覆盖。

你现在看到问题了吗？这就是名为 Topgrade 的新工具旨在解决的问题。

Topgrade：处理各种更新的单一程序

Topgrade 是一个 CLI 程序，它会检测你使用的工具，然后运行适当的命令来更新它们。



除了通常的 Linux 包管理器，它还可以检测和更新 Brew、Cargo、PIP、Pihole、Vim 和 Emacs 插件、R 软件包等。你可以在 维基页面 上查看支持的包列表。

Topgrade 的主要特点：


能够更新来自不同的包管理器的软件包，包括固件！

你可以如何控制更新包。

高度可定制。

甚至能够在更新包之前进行概览。


所以不要浪费任何时间，让我们跳到安装。

使用 Cargo 在 Linux 中安装 Topgrade

安装过程非常简单，因为我将使用 Cargo 包管理器。

我们已经有了 详细指南，其中包含设置 Cargo 包管理器的多种方法。所以我将在我的示例中使用 Ubuntu 来快速完成。

因此，让我们以最少方式安装依赖项以及 Cargo：

sudo apt install cargo libssl-dev pkg-config


安装 Cargo 后，使用给定的命令安装 Topgrade：

cargo install topgrade


它会抛出一个警告：



你只需添加 cargo 路径即可运行二进制文件。这可以通过给定的命令来完成，你需要使用你的用户名替换 sagar：

echo 'export PATH=$PATH:/home/sagar/.cargo/bin' >> /home/sagar/.bashrc


现在，重启系统，Topgrade 就可以使用了。但是等等，我们需要安装另一个包来更新 Cargo 以获取最新的包。

cargo install cargo-update


这样我们完成了安装。

使用 Topgrade

使用 Topgrade 非常简单。使用一个命令，就是这样：

topgrade





但这不会给你除了系统包之外的任何控制，但正如我所提到的，你可以将不想更新的仓库列入黑名单。

从 Topgrade 中排除包管理器和仓库

假设我想排除 Snap 和从默认包管理器下载的包，所以我的命令是：

topgrade --disable snap system




要进行永久更改，你必须在其配置文件中进行一些更改，这些更改可以通过给定的命令访问：

topgrade --edit-config


对于此示例，我排除了 Snap 和默认系统仓库：



试运行 Topgrade

评估将要更新的过时软件包总是一个好主意，我从 Topgrade 的整个目录中找到了这个最有用的选项。

你只需使用带有 -n 选项的 topgrade 命令，它就会生成过期软件包的摘要。

topgrade -n




检查需要更新的软件包的一种简洁方法。

总结

在使用 Topgrade 几周后，它成为了我的 Linux 武器库中不可或缺的一部分。 像大多数其他 Linux 用户一样，我只是通过我的默认包管理器更新包。 Python 和 Rust 包被完全忽略了。 感谢 Topgrade，我的系统现在完全更新了。

我知道这不是每个人都想使用的工具。那你呢？愿意试一试吗？

2021 年 6 月 2 日，开放组织Open Organization社区庆祝其成立六周年。这是六年来（上百篇的）文章、（一系列的）书籍、（具有启发性的）对话、（我们所 喜欢的）教学和学习。我们非常自豪地成为一个充满活力的开放专家和领导者的社区，致力于将 开放原则 带到大大小小的组织。事实上，许多 开放组织大使Open Organization Ambassadors 以帮助他人变得更加开放为职业，我们的社区仍然致力于帮助各行业的领导者以开放的心态和行为融入他们的社区和环境中。

去年 是开放组织项目的一个 成长 和 发展 时期。今年，我们将在这一势头的基础上继续努力。今天，我们很自豪地介绍两项新的倡议——当然，也邀请你的参加。

开启，调整，开放

首先，我们很高兴地宣布：我们社区的工作有了一个全新的场所。OpenOrgTV。这不仅仅是一个新的平台。它也是另一种媒介的实验：视频。

在我们的频道上，我们将举办各种对话 —— 从深层次的书评到社区圆桌会议。首先，请查看“开放领导力对话Open Leadership Conversations”系列，其中包括对某些富有洞察力的领导者的采访，提供他们对根据开放原则进行领导的意义的观点。或者观看我们的 Q&A 式写作节目 “问大使Ask the Ambassadors”，由社区专家回答你关于组织文化和设计的问题。也想参与这个节目吗？在我们的 新的专门的论坛 中向社区成员提交你的问题。

整个月，我们都会介绍 开放组织大使Open Organization Ambassadors，让你终于可以看到他们的面孔，并听到你多年来阅读的故事、案例研究和采访背后的声音。

数据库是以一种有组织且灵活的方式存储信息的工具。电子表格在本质上就是一个数据库，但是图形化应用程序这一限制使得大多数的电子表格应用程序对程序员毫无用处。随着 边缘计算 和物联网设备成为重要的平台，开发者们需要更有效且轻量级的方法，来存储、处理、查询大量的数据。我最爱的一种组合是使用 Lua 连接 ostgreSQL 数据库。无论你使用什么编程语言，PostgreSQL 一定是数据库的绝佳选择，但是在使用 PostgreSQL 之前，首先你需要知道一些基本的东西。

安装 PostgreSQL

在 Linux 上安装 PostgreSQL，要使用你的软件库。在 Fedora，CentOS，Megeia 等类似的 Linux 版本上使用命令：

$ sudo dnf install postgresql postgresql-server


在 Debian， Linux Mint， Elementary 等类似的 Linux 版本上使用命令：

$ sudo apt install postgresql postgresql-contrib


在 macOs 和 Windows 上，可以从官网 postgresql.org 下载安装包。

配置 PostgreSQL

大多数发行版安装 PostgreSQL 数据库时没有启动它，但是为你提供了一个脚本或 systemd 服务，能够可靠地启动 PostgreSQL。但是，在启动 PostgreSQL 之前，必须创建一个数据库集群。

Fedora

在 Fedora，CentOS 等类似的版本上，PostgreSQL 安装包中提供了一个 PostgreSQL 配置脚本。运行这个脚本，可以进行简单地配置：

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[10月12日消息，分析师郭明錤近期表示，苹果公司将继续实现供应链多样化，未来可能将 MacBook 的生产扩大到泰国地区。


郭明錤称，苹果计划在未来 3-5 年内增加从其他海外基地向美国发货的产品（约占全球出货量 25-30% 以上），但目前还不清楚这是否会包括将在泰国组装的 MacBook 电脑。苹果长期 MacBook 供应商广达电脑在过去几年中一直在扩大其在泰国的业务。


据悉，在过去几年中，苹果产品的供应链已扩展到印度和越南工厂生产。


另外分析师郭明錤还表示，根据苹果公司的计划，印度塔塔集团未来可能与和硕或纬创合作，发展 iPhone 组装业务。目前富士康在印度生产的 80% 以上的 iPhone 是为了满足其国内需求。塔塔集团与和硕或纬创的潜在合作可以加速提高海外基地生产 iPhone 的比例。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So, I have to check some OIDs -- object IDs, in this case, 14-digit decimal numbers -- against a file with paths listed. If any of the paths match any of the OIDs, I need to print out that path. I initially wrote it in Ruby, but it turned out that it was too darn slow, perhaps because there were 3.3 million OIDs, and 37 million file paths to check against. I tried with grep, but you can't append 3.3 million parameters to a command. So I simply read the OID file a line at a time, and fed it to grep. STILL slow -- about 1.5 seconds per OID. Total estimated time, something just shy of two months.
 Ouch.
 But then I learned about --file. With --file, you can place a match-per-line in a file, and then feed the file to grep. So, here's what happened:
 ken@mithrandir ~ $ time grep --file=SOIDs.txt allfilesanddirs.txt
 real 0m5.237s
 user 0m4.453s
 sys 0m0.761s
 Five seconds, eight weeks... tomato, tomahto, right?

Good chassis design, 100% aluminium, large battery, and (mostly) sane port options.
 I'm looking for a new laptop, and I just can't seem to find anything that intersects the quality and features that I want:
  
Full aluminum chassis. As far as general design goes... love 'em or hate 'em, Macbook Pros look and feel good.
 USB-C charging, ideally with at least one PD-compat port on each side of the chassis. No barrel connector or proprietary charging solution
 Unrestricted components (Macbooks, Windows' new co-processor) so that I can install what I want, when I want

Because of that I am going to start a series of posts named “Process ID Card” (aimed at providing the OS vocabulary). Based on a poll I have conducted I am going to start with Linux (Windows will follow).
 In order to create the list of processes I want to explain, I have installed a clean Ubuntu 22.04 VM (Desktop version) and executed ps. Probably the best way to do it is to go over the processes by the order of their PID value.
 The first one I want to talk about is the one we can’t see on the list, that is PID 0 (we can see it is the PPID for PID 1 and PID 2 — on them in the next posts). So let us dive into the details about PID 0, aka swapper (but also has the nicknames of sched …]]></summary>

was designed from the beginning to avoid existing patents in the field and

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[ISC DHCP 服务器停止维护

上周，ISC 发布了其 DHCP 服务器（dhcpd）的最后的维护版本，并宣布该服务器项目将在今年年底结束。除非发现非常严重的安全漏洞，ISC 没有计划继续发布更新，也同时停止了其代码的维护。发布于 1997 年的 ISC DHCP 是一个动态主机设置协议（DHCP）的服务器程序。ISC 结束这个项目是因为它不是为可测试性设计的，修改代码的风险性非常高，因此过去几年已经很少修改代码了。ISC 也发布了新的名为 Kea 的 DHCP 服务器作为替代。


消息来源：ISC



老王点评：除了 dhcpd，我从未注意过任何其它 DHCP 服务器，这么流行的一个默认级的开源软件就停止维护了，感觉还是很可惜。另外一个 ISC 的知名软件就是 DNS 服务器 BIND 了，不知道以后的下场如何。




VirtualBox 7.0 正式发布

甲骨文今天推出了 VirtualBox 7.0 版本，引入了诸多改进。最值得关注的改进是支持虚拟机完全加密运行，包括加密配置文件以及已保存的状态。不过加密仅支持通过命令行界面解开。此外还支持管理云端虚拟机；支持 DirectX 11 3D 加速；支持安全启动，等等。上一个大版本 VirtualBox 6.0 是 2018 年推出的。


消息来源：VirtualBox



老王点评：我觉得甲骨文还值得称道的开源贡献之一就是 VirtualBox 了，还好还在继续推出大版本更新。




超过四成的电脑仍然无法升级到 Windows 11

资产管理供应商 Lansweeper 称，在其测试的 6 万个组织的约 2700 万台 PC 中，有 42.76% 未能通过 CPU 测试，有 71.5% 没有通过内存测试，14.66% 没有通过 TPM 测试。研究还发现，Windows 11 采用率正在提高，在 1.44% 的计算机上运行，而在 1 月份只有 0.52%。另外，在被调查的商业设备中，约有 4.82% 的设备运行的是没有完整支持的操作系统，0.91% 的服务器已经报废。


消息来源：The Register



老王点评：不如把这些不能升级的电脑装上 Linux 吧~]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[这份简要指南能够帮助你快速开始使用 Git，以及配置一些选项。




在 Linux 中设置 Git 十分简单，但为了获得完美的配置，我做了以下五件事：


创建全局配置

设置默认名称

设置默认邮箱地址

设置默认分支名称

设置默认编辑器


我使用 Git 管理我的代码、命令行脚本以及文档版本。这意味着每次我开始一项新的任务，首先我需要创建一个文件目录并将其添加到 Git 库中：

$ mkdir newproject
$ cd newproject
$ git init


有一些我一直想要的常规设置。不多，但可以避免我每次都进行配置。我喜欢利用 Git 的 全局 配置功能。

Git 提供了进行手动配置的 git config 命令，但这有一些注意事项。例如，通常你会设置邮箱地址。你可以通过运行 git config user.email 你的邮件地址 命令进行设置。然而，这只会在你当前所在的 Git 目录下起作用。

$ git config user.email alan@opensource.com
fatal: not in a git directory


此外，当这个命令在 Git 仓库中运行时，它只会配置特定的一个仓库。在新的仓库中，你不得不重复这个步骤。我可以通过全局配置来避免重复。选项 --global 会指示 Git 将邮箱地址写入全局配置 ~/.gitconfig 文件中，甚至在必要时会创建它：


请记住，波浪线（~）代表你的主文件夹。在我的电脑中它是 /home/alan。


$ git config --global user.email alan@opensource.com
$ cat ~/.gitconfig
[user]
        email = alan@o…]]></summary>

那一年是 2020 年，关于大流行病的消息迅速涌来，每个人都感到完全被类似的新闻文章所淹没，提供了不同程度的更新。

但我需要知道的是，我们的官方准则何时改变。最后，这就是对我来说最重要的事情。

无论关注的是大流行病还是最新的科技新闻，提前了解网站内容的变化都至关重要。

changedetection.io 项目为网站变更检测和通知提供了一个简单但强大的开源解决方案。它很容易设置，而且可以通知 70 多个（还在不断增加）不同的通知系统，如 Matrix、Mattermost、Nextcloud、Signal、Zulip、Home Assistant、电子邮件等等。它还能通知专有应用，如 Discord、Office365、Reddit、Telegram 和许多其他应用。

但 changeetection.io 并不只是局限于观察网页内容。你也可以监视 XML 和 JSON 源，它将建立一个 RSS 馈送，记录变化的网站。

由于其内置的 JSON 简单存储系统，不需要设置复杂的数据库来接收和存储信息。你可以 使用 Docker 镜像运行 或用 pip 安装它。该项目有一个 全面的维基帮助页，大多数常见的问题都有涵盖。

对于使用复杂 JavaScript 的网站，你可以用内置的 Playwright 内容获取器 将你的 changeetection.io 连接到 Chromium 或 Chrome 浏览器。

运行后，在你的浏览器（默认情况下是 http://localhost:5000）中访问该应用。如果你的电脑可以从外部网络访问，你可以在 设置Settings中设置一个密码。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[谷歌 AI 引入了一个用于数组存储的高性能开源库 TensorStore。


谷歌开发的开源 C++ 和 Python 框架 TensorStore 旨在加速大型多维数组的读写设计。覆盖单一大型坐标系的多维数据集通常用于当代计算机科学和机器学习应用程序中。使用这些数据集具有挑战性，因为客户经常希望进行涉及多个工作站并行操作的调查，并且可能会以不可预测的间隔和不同的规模接收和输出数据。

谷歌研究院开发了 TensorStore，该库为用户提供了一个可以管理巨大数据集的 API，而无需复杂的硬件，以解决数据存储和操作问题。该库支持许多存储系统，包括本地和网络文件系统、谷歌云存储等。

为了加载和处理大量数据，TensorStore 提供了一个简单的 Python API。任何任意大小的基础数据集都可以加载和更新，而无需将数据集完整存储在内存中，因为在需要精确切片之前不需要在内存中读取或保存实际数据。

这是通过索引和操作语法实现的，它与 NumPy 操作的语法非常相似。除了虚拟视图、广播、对齐和其他复杂的索引功能，TensorStore 还支持如数据类型转换、降低取样和随意创建的数组这些功能。

此外，TensorStore 包含一个异步 API，可以并发进行读取或写入操作。在执行其他工作时，软件可以进行内存缓存处理（可配置），从而减少在访问常用数据时处理较慢存储系统的需要。

大型数值数据集需要大量的处理能力来检查和分析。实现这一点的常用方法是在分散在许多设备上的大量 CPU 或加速器内核之间并行化任务。在保持出色速度的同时并行分析单个数据集的能力一直是 TensorStore 的关键目标。 PaLM、脑图和其他复杂的大规模机器学习模型是 TensorStore 应用案例的一些例子。

 I'm a scripting noob in shell script. I know this is kinda out of band on this subreddit. sorry. 
 Can anyone give me some pointers(or a script!) that when a momentary push button on a pi is pushed, it will:
 -Check folder permissions on two folders.
 -if folder one is set to read, set to no access
 -If folder two is set to no access, set to read.
 -When pushed again, flop access on the folders. 
 This is digital signage for a small business food truck, and the chef is not a tech wiz... he's a chef. I need to make this as simple as possible for the guy. I have the hardware side down, but it'll literally take me hours to write a script to do this and i just don't have the time at the moment. 
 Thanks guys, i really appreciate any help you're willing to give.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[苹果公司推出的iPhone14及AppleWatch8中，内置了可以判断用户遭遇车祸的紧急报警功能，没想到却在用户坐过山车时会自动触发，让警察白跑一趟。


据美国《纽约邮报》10日报道，这起事件发生在俄亥俄州国王岛游乐园，当时，一位游客正在乘坐过山车，但她的iPhone14手机却自动拨打了报警电话，并向警方传送了她的位置。然而，当警方赶赴报案地点时，他们只看到游乐园的过山车。这已经是当地近期第6次出现这种误报警情况。


据苹果官方解释，这是因为iPhone14内置了可检测环境变化的全新陀螺仪，可根据外部信息和算法判断用户是否遭遇车祸，却没想到过山车同样也会造成相似环境变化。苹果表示将尽快修复这个问题。游乐园方面目前只能竖立警示牌，提醒苹果用户坐过山车时将手机调至飞行模式。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey everyone!
Excited to be able to share the release of `InvokeAI 2.0 - A Stable Diffusion Toolkit`, an open source project that aims to provide both enthusiasts and professionals a suite of robust image creation tools. Optimized for efficiency, InvokeAI needs only ~3.5GB of VRAM to generate a 512x768 image (and less for smaller images), and is compatible with Windows/Linux/Mac (M1 & M2).
InvokeAI was one of the earliest forks off of the core CompVis repo (formerly lstein/stable-diffusion), and recently evolved into a full-fledged community driven and open source stable diffusion toolkit titled InvokeAI. The new version of the tool introduces an entirely new WebUI Front-end with a Desktop mode, and an optimized back-end server that can be interacted with via CLI or extended with your own fork.
This version of the app improves in-app workflows leveraging GFPGAN and Codeformer for face restoration, and RealESRGAN upscaling - Additionally, the CLI also supports a large variety of features:
- Inpainting 
- Outpainting
- Prompt Unconditioning
- Textual Inversion
- Improved Quality for Hi-Resolution Images (Embiggen, Hi-res Fixes, etc.)
- And more...
Future updates planned included UI driven outpainting/inpainting, robust Cross Attention support, and an advanced node workflow for automating and sharing your workflows with the community.
We're excited by the release, and about the future of democratizing the ability to create. Check out the repo (https://github.com/invoke-ai/InvokeAI) to get started, and join us on Discord (https://discord.gg/ZmtBAhwWhy)!

I've found my SQL knowledge to be lacking, so I made a project that uses SQLite as a backend.
As it is intended for self-hosting I aim to make it easy to set up and maintain. Getting it up & running takes no more than a few commands (bar setting up a proxy such as nginx, which is out of scope).
I've set up a "demo" site at https://forum.agreper.com/ if you want to try out the UI.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Philip Herron and Arthur Cohen presented an
update on the "gccrs" GCC front end for the Rust language at the
2022 Kangrejos conference.  Less than
two weeks later — and joined by David Faust — they did it again at the 2022 GNU Tools Cauldron.
This time, though, they were talking to GCC developers and refocused their
presentation accordingly; the result was an interesting look into the
challenges of implementing a compiler for Rust.]]></summary>
