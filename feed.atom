        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The workplace policy has been in effect for many years, and was until recently an advertised perk of working for Slack. It allowed all employees access to free paid time off from 24th until the New Year (some employees like incident responders would take shifts, but even Customer Experience (their support team) ran skeleton shifts). Today they have announced this policy has ended as a result of the economy as well as making the workplace more equitable (as Salesforce employees could not access this benefit).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm pretty new to the world of WMs but have been using qtile for the past few weeks. I've only really done a couple of basic configurations on it so apologies if this is already possible in qtile
 Anyways I work exclusively on a laptop and usually without a mouse. It seems like most WMs i've played around with in VMs are either tiling WMs meant for people with a serious case of musophobia or traditional floating WMs like openbox which are primarily meant for mouse use
 I'd honestly love a workflow that can allow me to both use my touchpad and my keyboard depending on how I'm feeling. Bonus points for touchpad specific functionality
 I'm not specifically looking or a WM which has all these things out of the box, but honestly past "you know I'd really like a mouse+keyboard workflow" I don't know what exactly I'm looking for lol, so would appreciate a WM with enough documentation of its features so I can figure out exactly what I want and how to do it

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This is kind of an unusual post, but I wanted to share my experience of crossing paths with Ian. Edit: he died back in 2015. He purchased a piece of mine at an art show in Indy, where we both lived, maybe around 2003-5. I'm bad with dates. Later, he contacted me to commission a piece of art -- a rendition of a "Linux family tree" he had conceived of. I went to his place in downtown Indy to talk it over. He surprised me slightly by showing me the mockup on a Mac! It was kind of funny. I was familiar w Linux at the time and I had planned to do the piece, which he was going to get posters made of. He assured me we could sell 10K of them! That would have been great but my personal problems and the challenges of the project got in the way. It was most interesting to meet him though, and his death really gave me pause. I was left wondering whether his victimization at the hands of the SF police, and his stayed commitment to make it known, had something to do with it. Suicide was the given cause of his passing, but was that really the case? Perhaps it was, and in any case I mean no disrespect. Having met him was really cool, and I'll always wish I had tried harder to make good on the commission. He was an intense dude. RIP Ian. I'd love to hear from anyone who knew him or interacted with him online or otherwise. Any memories.

But after a few weeks, I started getting a message about the cmos battery going bad and after a coupe of more uses the laptop got stuck on tablet mode, so I can no longer use the keyboard. Is there any bios solutions or a way on how to reset the cmos battery to fix the issue? I remember from a video I watched a long time ago that linux does something different with the cmos battery compared to windows and I was wondering if that could be the issue.

Yet I am still free to do whatever I want like in a regular distribution, like installing native packages with transactional-update pkg install. And given the fact that it's a rolling release, I never have to worry about dist-upgrades. Count me in, I'm convinced.

At Abacus, we noticed that finance teams are increasingly paying attention to the climate impact of their purchase decisions, from travel policies, to cloud hosting, and beyond.

Firefox 浏览器即将引入名为 “Quick Actions” 的功能。用户可以在地址栏上直接输入命令，例如“查看页面源代码”、“打开浏览器设置”等等。Quick Actions 可以加速 Firefox 的某些操作，协助用户通过地址栏执行各项任务。而谷歌在 2020 年就为 Chrome 浏览器引入了该功能，用户可以直接在地址栏上输入并执行“管理密码”、“清除浏览数据”、“翻译页面”等命令。


消息来源：gHacks

微软再次调整销售开源软件的商店政策

微软上个月更新了它的应用商店规则，加入了一条“不要试图从开源或其他通常免费提供的软件中获利，也不要试图相对于产品提供的特性和功能定价过高”。微软的初衷被认为是善意的，旨在遏制重新打包免费的自由及开源软件将其变成付费软件的行为。然而自由及开源软件许可证并没有禁止此类行为，微软的规定将会影响其应用商店内的所有自由及开源软件。本周微软再次调整了应用商店政策，允许销售可免费获取的自由及开源软件，同时允许用户报告欺诈。


消息来源：Solidot



老王点评：这件事上，我想微软或许是善意的，但是动作有点冒失，文案也不够妥当。现在的解决方案比较合适，既允许开源软件卖钱，也允许对冒名者加以管理。

        <link href="https://linux.cn/article-14847-1.html?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss"/>
        <updated>2022-07-20T09:30:29.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[FreeDOS 提供了一个叫做 FreeDOS Edit 的用户友好的文本编辑器。




在任何操作系统中，编辑文件都是一项常有的任务。当你想去做一个某事的笔记、写封信给朋友或升级一个系统配置 —— 你需要一个文本编辑器。FreeDOS 提供了一个用户友好的文本编辑器（也许没啥想象力）叫做 “FreeDOS Edit”。

编辑文件

最简单的启用 FreeDOS Edit 的方式就就是输入 EDIT。它提供一个空的编辑器窗口。图案背景显示为一个空的“桌面”——提醒你没有编辑任何文件。



就像多数 DOS 应用程序一样，你可以按下你键盘上的 Alt 键来访问 Edit 的菜单。这就激活了这个菜单。在你按下 Alt 后，Edit 将切换到“菜单”访问方式，并高亮 “文件File” 菜单。如果你想要访问菜单栏上的一个不同的菜单，可以使用左右方向键。按向下的方向键并按下回车键来“进入”菜单。



你注意到所有菜单标题的第一个字母是不同的颜色么？这种高亮字母显示了一种快捷方式。例如，“文件File”菜单的“F”高亮为红色。所以你可以按下 Alt+F（Alt 和 F 同时按下），Edit 会显示“文件File”菜单。



你可以使用“文件File”菜单来开始一个新的（空）文件，或打开一个存在的文件。让我们开始一个新文件，使用方向键移动到“新建New“然后按下回车键。你也可以用 Ctrl+N （Ctrl 和 N 同时按下）打开一个新文件。



此后，编辑文件应该非常简单。大多数熟悉的快捷键都可以在 FreeDOS Edit 中使用：Ctrl+C 复制文本，Ctrl+X 剪贴文本，和 Ctrl+V 将复制的或剪贴的文本粘贴到新的地方。如果你需要在一个长文档中寻找一个特殊文本，按下 Ctrl+F。保存你的工作成果，请使用 Ctrl+S 以将变更提交到硬盘。

在 Edit 中编程

如果你是个程序员，你也许会发现扩展的 ASCII 表是一个有用的工具。DOS 系统支持“拓展的” ASCII字符集，通常被称之为“代码页 437”。0 到 127 的标准字符包括字母 A 到 Z（大写和小写）、数字和特殊字符，如标点符号。但是，从 128 到 255 的 DOS 拓展字符包括其它语言字符和“画线”元素。DOS 程序员有时需要使用这些拓展 ASCII 字符，所以 FreeDOS Edit 可以很容易地查看所有 ASCII 码和它们的相关字符的表格。

要查看这个 ASCII 表，请使用“工具Utilities”菜单，选择“ASCII 表ASCII Table”菜单项，这将显示一个包含该表格的窗口。



沿着左边，这张表显示十六进制值“00”到“F0”，顶部展示了单一值“0”到“F”。这些为每个字符的十六进制代码提供了一个快速参考。例如，第一行（00）和第一列（0）中的项目具有十六进制值 00 + 0，即0x00（“NULL”值）。而第五行（40）和第二列（1）中的字符，其数值为 40 + 1，即 0x41（字母 “A”）。



当你在表格内移动光标高亮不同的字符时，你会看到表格底部的值发生变化，展示了字符的十进制、十六进制和八进制编码。例如，移动光标以高亮在 C0 行和第 5 列的“行交叉”字符，显示这个扩展字符的代码为 197（十进制）、0xc5（十六进制）和 305（八进制）。在一个程序中，你可以通过输入十六进制值 0xc5 或八进制“转义代码” \305 来引用这个扩展字符。



请随意浏览 Edit 中的菜单，以发现其他不错的功能。例如，“选项Options”菜单允许你更改 Edit 的行为和外观。如果你喜欢使用更密集的显示，可以使用“显示Display”菜单（在“选项Options”下）将 Edit 设置为 25、43 或 50 行。你还可以强制 Edit 以单色（黑底白字）或反转模式（白底黑字）显示。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[这个初学者指南解释了在 Arch Linux 中安装 Yay AUR 助手的步骤。


Yay 是 “Yet Another Yogurt” 的缩写（LCTT 校注：Yogurt 是另外一个已经停止维护的 AUR 助手）。从技术上讲，它是用 Go 编程语言 编写的 pacman 封装器和 AUR 助手。它是当今最流行的 Arch 用户仓库（AUR） 助手。使用 Yay，你可以利用庞大的 Arch 用户软件包库并轻松编译和安装任何软件。

它可以自动执行许多包管理任务，例如搜索、动态解决依赖关系、编译和构建包，当然还有在 AUR 发布包。

让我们看看如何在 Arch Linux 或任何基于 Arch 的发行版（如 Manjaro）中安装 Yay。安装 Arch Linux 后，你可以通过 pacman 包管理器从三个主要的 Arch 官方仓库安装包。但是在全新的 Arch Linux 安装后，默认情况下不会安装 Yay。因此，你需要手动安装它以利用 AUR。

本指南涵盖以下主题：


在 Arch Linux 中安装 Yay

在 Manjaro 中安装 Yay

如何在 Arch Linux 和 Manjaro 中使用 Yay 安装包

一些 Yay 的技巧


在 Arch Linux 中安装 Yay

先决条件

打开终端并运行以下命令。出现提示时提供管理员密码。这些步骤需要 base-devel 包和 git 包进行编译和安装。

sudo pacman -S base-devel


sudo pacman -S git




安装 Yay

yay 包在 Arch 仓库中有两个版本，如下所示。


yay – 稳定版

yay-git– 开发版


对于本指南，我使用了稳定版。现在，进入 /opt 目录并克隆 git 仓库。

cd /opt
sudo git clone https://aur.archlinux.org/yay.git




更改源目录的所有者。将 debugpoint 替换为你的用户名。

sudo chown -R debugpoint:users ./yay


如果你不知道用户或组，可以使用以下示例查找用户和组。

id debugpoint


进入目录并编译。

cd yay


makepkg -si


这样就完成了 Arch Linux 中 Yay 的安装。



在 Manjaro 中安装 Yay

如果你使用 Manjaro Linux，yay 包可以在社区仓库中找到。你可以在 Manjaro 中使用以下命令轻松安装。

pacman -Syyupacman -S yay


现在，让我们看看如何使用 Yay 安装任何软件包，以及一些基本的 yay 用法。

如何使用 Yay 安装包

首先在 AUR 网站上搜索安装任何应用以获取包名。例如，要安装 featherpad 文本编辑器，请运行以下命令。

yay -S featherpad


安装后，你可以在应用菜单中找到应用启动器。



一些 Yay 的技巧

你还可以使用 yay 进行许多调整和系统操作。下面是一些示例。

刷新系统包并升级：

yay -Syu


使用包的开发版本并升级（运行此命令时要小心）：

yay -Syu --devel --timeupdate


删除任何包（例如，featherpad）：

yay -Rns featherpad


快速获取系统统计信息：



yay -Ps


我希望这个初学者指南能帮助你在 Arch Linux 中安装 Yay，然后使用 Yay 安装包，并执行不同的系统操作。

《传教士的诅咒：一个华北村庄的全球史》，沈艾娣著，郭伟全译，香港中文大学出版社2021年6月版，310页
全球史研究兴起于二十世纪中叶，主要关注跨国家、跨区域和跨文化的历史现象，强调人类历史的横向联系，致力于以“互动”的视角和方法来思考历史。近年来，随着全球史研究的不断深入，相关成果逐渐向微观化方向发展，宏观视野与微观个案的结合日益成为全球史研究的主流，催生出“全球微观史”（global microhistory）。全球微观史最早于2010年由美国著名汉学家欧阳泰（Tonio Andrade）提出，他认为，目前的全球史研究忽视了普通人的日常生活，建议学界采用微观史和传记的方法，将全球史的理论模型与真实的人结合起来。此后全球微观史研究不断发展，吸引了众多学者的关注和讨论，相关成果日渐增多。沈艾娣（Henrietta Harrison）所著《传教士的诅咒：一个华北村庄的全球史（1640-2000）》（以下简称《传教士的诅咒》）一书，便是其中的代表性著作。

一、《传教士的诅咒》的写作初衷

沈艾娣先后就读于剑桥、哈佛和牛津大学，分别获古典学学士、东亚区域研究硕士和东方学博士学位，此前曾在哈佛大学历史系教学，现执教于英国牛津大学东方学系。沈艾娣精通拉丁文，汉语也十分流利，这为其从事中国史的研究提供了便利。沈艾娣对清代以来华北乡村特别是山西地区的社会文化有着浓厚兴趣，先后著有《梦醒子：一位华北乡居者的人生（1857-1942）》（赵妍杰译，北京大学出版社2013年版）、《传教士的诅咒》、The Perils of Interpreting: The Extraordinary Lives of Two Translators between Qing China and the British Empire（…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Just finished this great essay by a favorite author of mine. Definitely recommend it. It's fairly dated now but a lot of the content interestingly still holds up today. Explores the nature of the operating system market and Windows/Mac/Linux from a standpoint that doesn't require a technical background. One thing I'm curious about... Stephenson makes it very clear that he is on the Linux side of the discussion, and perhaps he is biased, but he makes Linux systems to be unstoppable and Windows NT very buggy. However I recall the consensus on a different post asking 'what does windows offer that linux can't' to be stability. I'm not technically experienced and fairly young but I've been messing around with linux since I was a kid. (First time installing a linux distro would have been somewhere around 2005 to 2010). Where along the way did Windows surpass Linux in terms of stability? Or are these perhaps differing definitions or contexts of what exactly is meant by 'stable'?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A while back I wrote a CHIP-8 emulator (which is considered the Hello, World! of emulators and is more accurately a virtual machine since historically CHIP-8 was an interpreted language running on top of the COSMAC VIP to make game programming easier).
But a few months ago I got really interested in embedded software, so decided it would be neat to port my emulator to a STM32 MCU and design a console around it as a learning experience, since CHIP-8 never existed as a physical system.
I didn't know much about embedded software when I began, and even less about electronics, but I managed to write all the firmware from scratch and even designed my first PCB, resulting in a finished (though not very polished) handheld CHIP-8 console.
For those curious, the GitHub repo also has links to my dev blog about the project as well as a build guide.
Thanks for looking!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[日前，特斯拉CEO埃隆·马斯克在推特上回答狗狗币联合创始人比利·马库斯的问题时表示，自己已经将大脑上传至云端，并且已经与自己的虚拟版本交谈过。


　　资料显示，马斯克旗下神经科技公司Neuralink正在开发脑机接口。该设备将允许计算机将人的思想转化为行动，让他们仅仅通过思考就能执行诸如打字和按钮等操作。据悉，Neuralink未来五年的计划是让人类不必使用语言，直接通过大脑进行交流。也许在不远的未来，人类就能像动漫描述的那样，有机会前往游戏世界中开启自己的第二人生。


　　今年早些时候有报道称， 马斯克透露已经取得了美国食品和药物管理局的审批，将在今年进行人体实验。 马斯克还设想，人们能通过脑机接口把自己的“记忆”、“意识”直接导出，或许有一天我们可以用U盘、存储卡来储存自己的“灵魂”，实现人的“意识永生”。


　　2021年4月，Neuralink曾在社交媒体公布了一段猴子用自己的意念玩电子游戏的视频。当时，马斯克表示，这一技术的远期目标是让瘫痪的人可以通过意念使用手机。


　　何为脑机接口？


　　脑机接口作为一种新技术，近年来涌现出一些新的研究与应用。而早在2016年，马斯克就成立了这家专门致力于研究脑机接口的公司。


　　所谓“脑机接口”，就是 通过在大脑中植入微小的电极，利用电流让计算机和脑细胞产生互动。 2019年马斯克发布了首款产品，其原理是用激光在头骨上钻孔，然后再避开大脑血管、将一条线路植入脑中。


　　传统脑机接口分为 侵入式脑机接口 和 非侵入式脑机接口。 侵入式脑机接口需要通过开颅手术或者钻透颅骨将脑电传感器植入脑内，如 马斯克的Neuralink脑机接口需要直接从头骨植入，这可能会导致患者大脑的长期炎症。 而非侵入脑机接口虽然对人没有伤害，但是脑电信号微弱，识别准确率和实时性受限。


　　据每经网此前报道，卡耐基梅隆大学生物医学工程教授贺斌曾表示，目前的侵入式脑机接口需要将电极植入大脑，可能会对脑组织造成损伤。 侵入式脑机接口的人体试验主要针对有严重瘫痪或其他疾病的患者。 目前没有使用侵入式脑机接口对人类健康的风险数据，风险因素主要依手术过程而定。


　　国际电气电子工程师协会院士、得克萨斯大学奥斯汀分校电气和计算机工程教授何塞·米兰称： 据我从事侵入式脑机接口工作的同事称，他们尚未观察到患者因此失去以前的任何能力。 虽然可能产生一些局部损伤，但尚不足以造成额外的能力损失，因而这种风险似乎非常有限。对于非侵入式脑机接口，我们没有观察到任何风险。

4 月份的时候，ZDNet 称其测试版为“你将使用的最可爱的 Linux 发行版”，称赞这个精雕细琢的基于 Debian 的 Cutefish OS “难以置信的优雅”，带有类似于 MacOS 的整洁的桌面。而我们 早已知道，这个由国内团队开发的桌面，已经失联一段时间了。有一些爱好者发起了复刻 Cutefish DE 的行动。而现在，国际开源社区也注意到了这一情况，并已经有一些社区在努力了。比如 OpenMandriva 试图给他们的发行版增加一个 Cutefish DE 桌面环境；Arch Linux 社区也有了独立的 Cutefish DE 软件包。

老王点评：希望可以有一个正式的继承者可以接管 Cutefish DE 的遗产，让更多的贡献者可以加入其中。




因无法找到合适的供应商，字节跳动考虑自研芯片

字节跳动公司发言人今天证实，该公司正在探索可供自身在专业领域使用的芯片设计，因为该公司无法找到能够满足其要求的供应商。这些芯片将用来处理该公司在多个业务领域的相关工作负荷，包括视频平台、信息和娱乐应用。此举标志着字节跳动将加入一系列研发半导体的中国互联网巨头行列。过去几年，包括百度、阿里巴巴在内的许多公司都发布了自己设计的芯片。不过，他们仍需要台积电等代工商来帮助其生产芯片。字节跳动还表示，不会将其芯片销售给其他公司。

        <link href="https://www.williamlong.info/archives/6867.html"/>
        <updated>2022-07-19T12:10:39.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[7月19日下午消息，近日，美国一些用户发起针对苹果公司的集体诉讼，指控苹果公司违反了美国反垄断法，主要因iPhone，iPad或Apple Watch上，只能用Apple Pay 唯一一种移动支付手段进行支付。


　　此次，是由律师事务所Hagens Berman和Sperling & Slater等律师事务所共同提起诉讼。声称苹果公司通过阻止竞争对手在其设备上使用NFC近场通讯功能，从而阻止像Google Pay、Samsung Pay这类等竞争软件在苹果设备提供移动支付服务，而且通过这种方式，每年“非法获利”至少10亿美元。


　　起诉书称，用美国发行的银行卡在Apple Pay完成的每笔交易，发卡机构都必须向苹果公司支付0.15%的信用卡费用和0.5%的借记卡费用。相比之下，谷歌允许在Android智能手机上使用多个移动钱包，并且不会向美国发卡机构收取费用。


　　“将Apple Pay与其他在安卓设备上可用的移动钱包（如Google Pay，Samsung Pay）的功能进行比较，就像是照镜子，功能是相同的，“哈根斯·伯曼（Hagens Berman）律所联合创始人兼管理合伙人史蒂夫·伯曼（Steve Berman）说，“但是，使用安卓上的移动钱包，发卡机构不必支付任何费用，而通过Apple Pay，他们每年要花费总计10亿美元。”


　　起诉书称，如果Apple Pay服务在苹果设备上加入其他竞争对手，苹果将无法维持其通过Apple Pay获得的大量收入。


　　本诉讼在加州北部的美国地方法院提起，具体的内容是，指控苹果公司多次违反《联邦谢尔曼法案》，将Apple Pay“捆绑”到其移动设备上，并且垄断了iOS的移动支付市场。


　　此次诉讼要求免除在使用Apple Pay时所有发卡机构向苹果公司支付的费用。


　　伯曼表示，这是苹果公司第三次因为违反反垄断法而被起诉。2015年，该律师事务所就电子书定价问题与苹果公司和出版公司达成了5.6亿美元的和解协议，今年年初，该律师事务所代表iOS的应用开发者与苹果公司达成了1亿美元的和解协议，开发者表示苹果公司当时的规则是应用商店要收取30%的抽成，这样的数字过高了。


　　Apple Pay在其他地区也面临类似的审查，其中包括澳大利亚和欧洲。今年5月，欧盟委员会向苹果公司通报了其初步的看法，即认为，苹果公司通过限制苹果设备上的NFC技术功能限制其他支付方式，滥用了其在iOS设备的移动支付市场上的主导地位。


　　近几年，反大公司垄断的风潮一直持续，苹果因其封闭的生态环境尤其被关注。从App Store的“侧载”，到30%的抽成问题，以及今天的Apple Pay支付。几乎每个环节都有被起诉的风险，苹果也正在通过变通的手段改进这些问题。

 Please, vote to support development of the GMMK software for Linux: https://gloriouspcgaming.featureupvote.com/suggestions/303622/linux-mintubuntudebian
 They disregarded it because it only has 20 votes, let's show them!!
 EDIT: They decided to port it to MacOS after 70 votes, we can do this!! 
 P.S.: They announced that they are about to release a new and improved version of that software for Windows (Q4), which is overall good news for us users because the current version sucks very hard...

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello there, as the title indicates, I'm looking for good alternatives for Irfan View. Features I'd love to have: - paste an image from clipboard (e.g. after taking a screenshot) - simple selecting and cutting as in Irfan View - batch converting / renaming based on EXIF data - the application should be more or less as lightweight as Irfan View is. GIMP is a very nice piece of software but a bit too heavy for doing this simple tasks quickly. 
 I'm currently running GNOME and as far as I've noticed, eye of gnome isn't capable of any of this features.
 Thank you very much and have a good day :)

早在 1985 年，自由软件基金会（FSF）就开始提倡源代码共享的理念，并从此打响了为计算机用户和开发者捍卫权利的斗争。FSF 认为，用“开放Open”和“封闭Closed”这两个词来划分软件，十分具有局限性；于是，在为程序分类时，转而使用了以下词语：尊重自由（这个“自由free”或这个“自由Libre”）或践踏自由（“非自由non-free”或“专有proprietary”）。不管用语如何，关键之处在于，计算机必须受用户控制，而不是任由开发了计算机软件的公司来摆布。正因如此，GNU 工程、Linux 内核、Freedesktop.org 等众多自由软件项目，才会如此重要。

最近，FSF 新上任了一位执行董事，她叫 Zoë Kooyman。我初见 Zoë 时，是在 2019 年的一个 All Things Open 大会上。当然，那个时候她还不是 FSF 的执行董事，不过已经在管理 FSF 不断增长的重大活动了 —— 包括 LibrePlant。她之前递给我了一份自由软件作者的名单，名单长得一眼望不尽，而且那些软件都是我每天在用的。由此，我也很受她那充沛的精力和诚恳的态度所打动。我只是偶然参加了一次 FSF 的聚会，但最后却和那些人成了朋友。是他们让我的数字生活有了意义，是他们保障了我能够拥有 Zoë 和 FSF 所说的 四项基本自由：


无论用户出于何种目的，用户必须可以按照自己的意愿，自由地运行该软件（自由之零）。

用户可以自由地学习并修改该软件，使它按照你的意愿进行计算（自由之一）。作为前提，用户必须可以得到该软件的源代码。

用户可以自由地分发该软件的副本，这样就可以帮助别人（自由之二）。

用户可以自由地分发该软件修改后的副本（自由之三）。借此，用户可以把改进后的软件分享给整个社区，令他人也从中受益。作…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[这是一个可能的情景。你的系统收到了内核更新，但不知何故，事情不像以前那样顺利。

你意识到，如果你启动到较旧的内核（是的，你可以降级内核），一切都会恢复正常。

高兴之余你会觉得有点儿不爽。因为你不得不在每次启动时手动选择较旧的内核。

一位年长的读者遇到了这个问题。Linux Mint 中的新内核更新没有按预期工作。启动到较旧的内核“修复”了问题，但麻烦的是在每次启动时要去手动选择较旧的内核。

删除新内核而使用旧内核不是一个好主意，因为新内核将会在下一次系统更新时被安装使用。

因此，我建议设置成默认启动到较旧的 Linux 内核。怎么做？这就是我将在本教程中向你展示的内容。

启动至较旧的 Linux 内核

你可能不了解，你的 Linux 发行版会在你的系统上安装多个 Linux 内核。不信？使用以下命令 列出 Ubuntu 中已安装的内核：

apt list --installed | grep linux-image


当你升级系统时会获得一个新版本的内核，这时你的系统会自动选择启动至最新的可用内核。

在 grub 屏幕中，你可以转到高级选项Advanced option（较旧的 Linux 版本）：



在这里，你可以看到要启动的可用内核。选择较旧的（不带恢复选项recovery option 的条目）：



你不会注意到任何显示的差异。你的文件和应用程序保持不变。

现在你已经启动到旧内核，是时候让你的系统自动启动到它了。

使旧内核成为默认启动项

如果你乐于使用 Linux 终端和命令，你可以修改 /etc/default/grub 文件并在其中添加以下行：

GRUB_DEFAULT=saved
GRUB_SAVEDEFAULT=true


然后使用如下命令 更新 GRUB：

sudo update-grub


你在这里所做的是告诉你的系统将当前使用的启动项保存为将来运行 GRUB 的默认启动项。

然而，并不是每个人都善于使用命令行，因此我将专注于一个名为 Grub Customizer 的 GUI 工具。

安装 Grub Customizer

使用官方 PPA 在基于 Ubuntu 的发行版中安装 Grub Customizer：

sudo add-apt-repository ppa:danielrichter2007/grub-customizer
sudo apt update
sudo apt install grub-customizer


对于其他发行版，请使用你的包管理器来安装此工具。

使用 Grub Customizer 更改默认启动项

当你运行 Grub Customizer 时，它会显示可用的启动项。



在这里你有两个选择。

选择一： 选择所需的内核项并使用箭头按钮（显示在顶部菜单上）将其向上移动。



选择二： 将先前的启动项previously booted entry设为默认启动项default entry。



我建议使用第二个选择，因为即使有新的内核更新它也可以工作。

这样你就可以在 Ubuntu 或其他发行版中降级内核，甚至无需删除新内核版本。

请注意，像 Ubuntu 这样的发行版大部分一次只保留两个内核版本。因此，最终你首选的旧内核将在新的内核版本释出时被删除。

这个巧妙的技巧曾助我脱困。当时我 在 Ubuntu 中安装最新的 Linux 内核 ，由于某种原因它与我的音频系统有些兼容问题。

无论是什么原因，你现在都知道如何自动启动到旧内核。

如果有问题或建议，请在评论区留言。

 Coming from a person who has used Windows all his childhood and teenage years, I installed Ubuntu in 2012 and never turned back, I'm very thankful for Ubuntu and Canonical for opening me up to Linux with their easy to use Linux distro, as Linus Torvalds said in 2006, he likes Ubuntu because it made Debian easier to install, configure and use, Linus hates hard to install and to configure LInux distros because he doesn't want to constantly fight with his system, he wants to get on with his life and that's kernel development.

《不正义的多重面孔》，[美]朱迪丝·N.施克莱著，钱一栋译，上海人民出版社，2020年4月出版，233页，40.00元
在正义理论的巅峰年代思考不正义

施克莱的学术研究一向反潮流。

上世纪五六十年代，意识形态终结论在西方学界甚嚣尘上。施克莱独辟蹊径，以意识形态专家的身份写了一本“法学书”（《守法主义》，1964），不仅嘲讽哈耶克，点破法哲学中的世纪争论“哈特-富勒之争”只是同个屋檐下的小打小闹，还超越这些法学个案，作了一项极具洞察力的时代诊断：以法治为代表的去道德化、去政治化话语，只是一种“反意识形态的意识形态”，是冷战语境下西方的特定意识形态反应。1981年，麦金太尔的《追寻美德》出版，美德伦理学复兴浪潮走向顶峰。施克莱依然不走寻常路，写了《平常的恶》（1984）这样一本怎么看都不像政治理论的政治理论著作，从恶习性（vices）入手来思考自由主义社会的公民品格问题。

《不正义的多重面孔》（1990）也是一本反潮流之作。上世纪八十年代，罗尔斯的正义理论独步学林，社群主义思潮也如日中天。社群主义基本靠批判罗尔斯起家，因此也免不了把正义作为最重要的研究主题。除了查尔斯·泰勒，其他几位社群主义巨匠的政治哲学代表作，名字里都带着正义：桑德尔的“出道即巅峰”之作《自由主义与正义的局限》（1982），沃尔泽致力于将正义“化一为多”的《正义诸领域》（1983），以及麦金太尔那本名字被套用滥了的《谁之正义？何种合理性？》（1989）。

1986年，施克莱在一本名家荟萃的文集上发表长文《不正义、伤害与不平等：一个导论》（“Injustice, Injury, and Inequality: An Introduction,” in Justice and Equality Here and Now, edi…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm aware that previous touchpad driver (synaptic) had bugged kinetic scroll, like scrolling wont stop even if user move cursor to another window. But I was playing with my friend's MacBook and saw apple's implementation of kinetic scroll: you easily scroll with two fingers, but if you move cursor scrolling stops, so there's cannot be such bug as synaptics one So I asked myself why did not implement this elegant solution to libinput (as far as I know it's future and Wayland etc), and now asking you, community I would happily make some mr to this, or at least make fork for it, but I know for sure that I have not enough knowledge and abilities to do this, maybe someone would want to do this, I will help if I can (even tho I don't know if there is something useful I can do)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey everybody. I just saw a Linux solution that I think is very unique and I wanted t share it.
 My school is full of macs but some of us still wants to use Linux (for development using Valgrind) and he made an Alpine docker image and a bash script that launches that, when docker is running, starts the Linux machine and automatically connects to it. The ingenious thin that I didn't think about is that it mounts the Mac home partition for itself, so it can fully interact with the files flawlessly. 
 I find this hole think really cool, and I'll probably use it for development as well.
 Have you guys used /heard about this kind of setup, do you have any tips to make even better use of it?

Interesting would be items whose manufacture could be automatized to some extent, but this is not necessary.
I am not particularly interested in the legality of this at the moment. But safety considerations could be important.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am currently working on transferring my dotfiles to a public repository on github, as Linux users often do. I'm doing it mostly for redundancy and personal ease of use, of course, but I still want to make sure that other people are free to copy my files and/or take inspiration from them as they create their own. That means I need a license of some sort.
 However, choosing a license for a dotfiles repository doesn't seem quite as cut-and-dry as choosing a license for a program of my own design. These files aren't exactly my personal creation; I mean, they were written by me, but they're essentially just a set of options being passed to their respective programs. It doesn't quite feel fair to the developers of Alacritty, for instance, for me to say "Alacritty I want you to use this hex for the color blue" and then turn around and distribute that as if it were my own work.
 During my research I've found examples of a few different kinds of licenses in random people's repositories, but so far I've been unable to find any articles, guides, or even discussions on the subject. So: what is the accepted practice for choosing a license for a dotfiles repository?

Chinese people have been deprived of freedom of speech even before the COVID-19 pandemic. Li Wenliang, who was among the first to notice the spread of the virus and warned his colleagues about it in a private WeChat group, was admonished by the police for "spreading rumors"; his punishment was then aired on the national TV channel. After Wenliang passed away due to getting COVID-19 himself, discussions …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[One of the key selling points of the BPF subsystem is that loading a BPF
program is safe: the BPF verifier ensures that the program cannot hurt the
kernel before allowing the load to occur.  That guarantee is perhaps
losing some of its force as more 
capabilities are made available to BPF programs but, even so, it may be a
bit surprising to see this
proposal from Artem Savkov adding a BPF helper that is explicitly designed to
crash the system.  If this patch set is merged in something resembling its
current form, it will be the harbinger of a new era where BPF programs are,
in some situations at least, allowed to be overtly destructive.]]></summary>

ways to make the Unix cat utility more efficient on

	The first possible option is the venerable sendfile syscall, which

	descriptor to be a socket, but this restriction was removed in
	Linux 2.6.33. Unfortunately, sendfile is not perfect: because it

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[FSF 仍坚持使用古老而自由的服务器硬件

自由硬件日益稀缺，但自由软件基金会（FSF）仍然在坚持其理念，它的服务器配置都相当古老，因为新一代的硬件都含有非自由的私有固件。FSF 最近表示它更换了最后一台运行非自由 BIOS 的机器。目前它有两个数据中心和逾百个虚拟机。英特尔和 AMD 在 2013 年之后发售的 CPU 都不支持自由 BIOS。这些 CPU 都会在 BIOS 中安装私有固件，如英特尔管理引擎（IME）。这些 CPU 也会拒绝运行未经过 AMD 和英特尔私钥加密签名的固件，而他们只会签名自己的非自由固件。


消息来源：FSF



老王点评：从自由软件和开源软件两个略有分歧的路线开始，现在看起来开源软件越来越广泛，而自由软件面临的局面越来越艰难了。因为，那些“拥抱”开源的企业发现，开源对他们是有利的，而自由软件则不是。




各国程序员平均年薪，美国第一，中国仅相当于美国的 1/5

一家招聘平台统计分析了 20 多个国家的软件开发者在 2022 年的薪资状况，并列出了排名数据。据统计，2022 年年薪最高的三个国家为：美国（11 万美元）、瑞士（9.8 万美元）和以色列（7.2 万美元）。而中国为 2.4 万美元，约折合人民币 16 万，仅相当于美国程序员平均收入的 21.6%。就全球使用的编程语言而言，Golang 和 Python 语言薪酬最高，PHP、JavaScript 语言最低。


消息来源：Code Submit



老王点评：今天正好在朋友圈看到一位朋友的信息，曾经的一位专业的 IT 女工程师，去跳槽到一家做减肥的微商公司。不由得感慨，在中国做 IT 真是艰难啊。不过，之前我们发过的另外一个消息显示，美国对 IT 专家的缺口很大，以至于业界要求政府加强计算机教育。




Fedora 37 有望装备基于网页的全新 Anaconda 安装程序

在今年早些时候，红帽公司宣布正在为 RHEL/Fedora 的 Anaconda 安装器开发全新基于网页的用户界面。即将于今年秋季发布的 Fedora 37 虽然会保留基于 GTK 的 Anaconda 安装器，但也会提供下一代基于网页的 Anaconda 安装器，带来全新的界面和安装体验。全新的界面更加现代化，未来将会彻底替代现有基于 GTK 的 Anaconda 安装器。


消息来源：Phoronix



老王点评：这倒是不错，其实采用网页可以有更丰富的表现力和功能。]]></summary>

我们经常忘记，有成千上万的、可以与同类商业产品相媲美的自由开源应用。此外，若你是 Windows 用户，并考虑完全摆脱 Windows ，你也应该事先了解此类应用程序。

因此，在这篇“必备的 Ubuntu 应用”文章中，我们为急需这些信息的 Linux 用户列举了 10 款应用。

这是这个系列的第三篇文章，如果你错过了之前的文章，可以通过以下链接阅读：

Safe Eyes

眼睛很宝贵，如果你是长时间使用平板或电脑的用户，你应该保护好眼睛。这里有一款可以帮助你保护眼睛的应用 —— Safe Eyes ，能够帮你减少并预防用眼过度。

Safe Eyes 这款应用会在你的工作期间为你提供“顺时针转动眼睛 10 秒”等活动的弹出式指令。

我认为它是每个人都应该尝试使用的一款 Ubuntu 应用。



通过 PPA 可以很容易在 Ubuntu 上安装 Safe Eyes 。你可以打开终端并使用以下命令安装这款应用。

I had to get a new one but I was broke so I just picked up the cheapest one that could fit into my laptop. I didn’t think of the wattage of it at the time so I severely underpowered my laptop causing it to run so slow that windows wasn’t even a possibility for me. I looked around online for a couple hours and I stumbled across an operating system that promised to breathe new life into my laptop. I booted into Linux mint and it worked like a dream. I’ve never looked back since and I’m glad I did. How did you start using Linux?

北宋名僧惠洪（1071-1128）出入儒释道，擅场诗文词，兼通书画及医术，著述凡二十余种，一百多卷，在佛教历史、佛禅义旨、文学创作及批评等诸多领域均卓有建树、影响深远。然而，其别集《石门文字禅》却从无本土校注本。此书三十卷，收录惠洪一生单篇诗文，时间跨度近四十年，内容涉及大量佛教历史和观念，牵扯北宋众多僧徒与文人士大夫，写作背景难定，古典今事繁多深奥，文字错讹阙文时见，难解之处众多。惠洪著述在东亚禅林广为流传，宝永七年（1710），日本曹洞宗僧人廓门贯彻耗时二十年的《注石门文字禅》刊刻问世，惜注释颇多谬误，难解处又多付阙如，虽称首创，终显粗疏。中国学者周裕锴教授笃志古学，与宋代惠洪、日本廓门展开跨时空对话，积二十多年心力，完成《石门文字禅校注》一书，于2021年由上海古籍出版社出版，后出转精，既是中国古籍整理的一大成果，也是汉字文化圈的一大因缘。
廓门贯彻的《注石门文字禅》
黄永年先生在《古籍整理概论》中指出：“要给一部书作注，一定要对这部书真正下过功夫，起码通读、精读过好几遍，对书的作者、对书的内容，以及对书的作用都得有深切的理解。此外，还得了解当时的时代和文化学术情况，了解与这部书有关的其他古籍。只有这样，才算基本上具备了给这部书作注的能力。”就为惠洪作注而言，周裕锴教授（下称“注者”）无疑是最佳人选。他在唐宋文学、禅文化、古代阐释学三大领域均深耕多年，著述宏富，在《苏轼全集校注》中主要负责《苏轼文集校注》，筚路蓝缕，达到极高学术水准；其专著《宋代诗学通论》体大思精，一版再版；《中国禅宗与诗歌》《文字禅与宋代诗学》《禅宗语言》《法眼与诗心》《梦幻与真如》诸多著作对佛禅与文学、…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[你好! 我最近又开始运行一些服务器（nginx playground、mess with dns、dns lookup），所以我一直在考虑监控问题。

最初我并不完全清楚如何监控这些网站，所以我想快速写下我是如何做到的。

我根本不打算谈如何监控大型的、严肃的关键任务网站，只谈微型的不重要的网站。

目标：在操作上几乎不花时间

我希望网站大部分时间都能正常工作，但我也希望不用在持续的运营上花费时间。

我最初对运行服务器非常警惕，因为在我的上一份工作中，我是 24/7 轮流值班，负责一些关键的服务，在我的印象中，“负责服务器”意味着“在凌晨 2 点被叫起来修理服务器”和“有很多复杂的仪表盘”。

所以有一段时间我只做静态网站，这样我就不用考虑服务器的问题。

但最终我意识到，我所要写的任何服务器的风险都很低，如果它们偶尔宕机 2 小时也没什么大不了的，我只需设置一些非常简单的监控来帮助它们保持运行。

没有监控很糟糕

起初，我根本没有为我的服务器设置任何监控。这样做的结果是非常可预见的：有时网站坏了，而我却没有发现，直到有人告诉我！

步骤 1：uptime 检查器

第一步是建立一个 uptime 检查器。外面有很多这样的东西，我现在使用的是 updown.io 和 uptime robot。我更喜欢 updown 的用户界面和 定价 结构（它是按请求而不是按月收费），但 uptime 机器人有一个更慷慨的免费套餐。

它们会：


检查网站是否正常

如果出现故障，它会给我发电子邮件


我发现电子邮件通知对我来说是一个很好的通知级别，如果网站宕机，我会很快发现，但它不会吵醒我或做其它的什么打扰。

步骤 2：端到端的健康检查

接下来，让我们谈谈“检查网站是否正常”到底是什么意思。

起初，我只是把我的健康检查端点之一变成一…]]></summary>

testing.



	We obviously had that whole "Retbleed" thing, and it does show up
	in both the diffstat and the shortlog, and rc7 is definitely bigger
	than usual.  And also as usual, when we've had one of those
	embargoed hw issues pending, the patches didn't get the open
	development, and then as a result missed all the usual sanity
	checking by all the automation build and test infrastructure we
	have. So no surprise - there's been various small fixup patches
	afterwards too for some corner cases.

	That said, last week there were two other development trees that
	independently also asked for an extension, so 5.19 will be one of
	those releases that have an additional rc8 next weekend before the
	final release.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I recently worked on a project that required me to automate an ssh login with terminal prompt, sending various commands and checking the result of a test after it runs. Python is not installed on our server, which uses Paramiko to automate this sort of thing. But I was easily able to create a script using the Linux program called Autoexpect, which was written by Don Libes in 1990. I just call up the script that was automatically generated by Autoexpect (or you can write your own Expect script) and it runs the commands. There are options for accepting command-line inputs, adding wait times, and other tweaks that one might need to run through the prompts correctly. Just wanted to share. Thanks!

 Findex v0.6.0 comes with vast improvements. This release isn't supposed to change the look of Findex that much. However, Findex was rewritten to have a better codebase in this release. Because of this, the performance of Findex has increased significantly. Check out the release page to see changelog.
 Release: https://github.com/mdgaziur/findex/releases/tag/v0.6.0
 Currently I'm very busy taking preparation for upcoming exam. So, I took shortcut and decided to use systemd to restart findex when configurations change. I'll properly implement it in next release.

开源代码几乎在地球上的每一台计算机上运行，当今世界重度依赖于 Linux 内核。这也意味着任何人都能够参与到代码的编写、阅读和使用过程中，这点让美国军方内部的网络安全专家感到十分担心。“关键的开源软件以我们仍然几乎不了解的方式，暴露于恶意的操纵之下。”美国国防部高级研究计划局（DARPA）设立了一个计划长达 18 个月、耗资数百万美元的 SocialCyber 项目。最终目标是检测并抵御任何恶意活动、提交有缺陷的代码、介入干预、阻止开发，甚至接管整个开源项目。为此研究人员将使用情绪分析等工具，来分析开源社区内的社交互动 —— 比如 Linux 内核邮件列表。这将有助于确定谁在积极参与建设，同时谁又在消极怠工或悄悄搞破坏。

IE 团队收到来自 Mozilla 的谢幕祝贺蛋糕

微软的 IE 浏览器已于 6 月正式退役，这对科技行业的几乎所有人来说都是一个快乐的时刻。按照互相送蛋糕的悠久传统，Mozilla 的 Firefox 团队给微软 IE 团队送了最后一个蛋糕，以庆祝历史悠久的 IE 浏览器的落幕。蛋糕上面有一个巨大的 IE 标志。蛋糕上写着：“you were the ie6ing on the cake”。浏览器开发团队互相赠送蛋糕是一个可以追溯到十多年前的传统。微软在 2006 年Firefox 2.0 发布时给 Firefox 团队送了一个蛋糕，并在后来大多数的 Firefox 主要版本发布时都延续了这一传统。尽管随着浏览器发布周期的加快，这些蛋糕最终变成了杯子蛋糕。在 2012 年 IE 10 到来之后，Mozilla 向微软送了一个蛋糕，然后谷歌的 Chrome 团队也开始加入向对手送蛋糕的行列。

老王点评：还好，这次的蛋糕比较大，够团队分着吃了。




谷歌应用商店将由开发者来编写应用的权限描述

谷歌正在关闭独立的“应用权限”部分，新的数据安全部分显示了开发者提供的隐私注意事项清单，比如一个应用程序收集哪些数据，这些数据是如何存储的，以及这些数据与谁共享。开发者可以解释如何以及为什么要收集每一点数据。旧的应用程序权限列表可以保证是真实的，因为它是由谷歌通过扫描应用程序自动建立的。而数据安全系统则是在荣誉系统上运行的。谷歌称，“谷歌应用商店审查所有政策要求的应用；但是，我们不能代表开发者对他们如何处理用户数据做出判断。……当谷歌意识到你的应用行为与你的声明之间存在差异时，我们可能会采取适当的行动，包括执法行动。”

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[On Alpine Linux, I noticed that windowing operations seem almost slow on X11. For example, in KeePassXC, sometimes I can trigger an action that shows a dialog, but then press Enter before the dialog even shows up. But on Windows, the same KeePassXC shows the dialog instantly - so there's no chance I can accidentally press a key too soon.
 This raised a question in my mind: is X11 slower than Windows? Is there some secret way to speed it up, or is the architecture just fundamentally slow?
 I run Xorg with Fluxbox as the window manager and Picom as the compositor. Would any of these be the reason for my observed slowness? Maybe the fact that I only have graphics acceleration on my iGPU, and not my Nvidia GPU?
 (Bonus: is Wayland faster than X11? I don't want to use it, because my entire reason for using X11 at the moment is because I want to make a compositor, not an entire desktop environment, but I'm curious anyway.)
 Note that this isn't a support request - I'd rather discuss if there's something up with X11's architecture that would make it fundamentally incapable of surpassing Windows' performance. Like how everything uses network connections to localhost...

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[在本杂志 2022 年 4 月号中，我们了解了不同类型的 SSL 证书及其应用。本文介绍如何手动更新现有 SSL 证书，以使其保持最新的安全要求。

当访问者与你的网站互动并分享信用卡号码等关键细节时，他们相信他们的信息已得到保护，不会被滥用。因此，你有责任尊重这种信任并为你网站上的所有访问者提供全面保护。不这样做不仅会使你失去客户的忠诚度，而且还可能使你陷入法律困境。在许多情况下，无法保护客户数据免遭泄露、盗窃或滥用的网站被迫支付巨额罚款，同时也失去了声誉。

SSL 证书如何保护客户的数据？

保护敏感客户信息的最佳方法之一是使用 SSL（安全套接字层）证书保护你的站点。用不涉及技术细节的话来说，SSL 证书对 Web 服务器和访问者浏览器之间的通信进行加密，从而使黑客或威胁参与者在技术上不可能窃取传输中的数据。 SSL 建立了一个安全的握手过程来解密加密的信息，这个过程太复杂了，人类甚至软件都无法破解。（LCTT 校注：此处言过其实，SSL 加密传输的信息并不是绝对不可截获和破解的，比如中间人攻击等。）

为什么需要更新 SSL 证书？

虽然 SSL 证书提供了防止数据盗窃或滥用的安全性，但你需要定期更新它以确保最有效的安全性以抵御最新的威胁。本文将列出以正确方式更新 SSL 证书的分步说明。

更新 SSL 证书有很多好处：


及时更新验证你的网站的身份。

获得更新的安全性。

一年有效期促进定期更新/升级保护范围的健康实践，从而消除与过时版本相关的风险。



注意：最佳做法是选择一种自动续订方式，以减轻你记住续订日期或手动执行相关步骤的压力。


有点跑题了，构建你自己的 SSL 证书的纯开源方式

是的，这绝对是真的！通过一些简化和紧凑的步骤，你实际上可以从头开始构建自己的 SSL 证书！虽然整个过程超出了本文的范围，但这…]]></summary>

近期，一个旨在打造经典诺基亚（小型）的 Linux 手机的开源项目，遭到了诺基亚的抨击。

该项目的名称最初是 “Notkia”，然而，诺基亚认为该名称与自己相似，可能会影响自己的品牌声誉，并侵犯到自己的权利。

虽然这样做可以保护公司的业务，但这些公司向在当前状态下甚至对他们构不成威胁的项目发送侵权通知是怎么回事？

Notkia：开发一款袖珍 Linux 手机

不过还得 感谢 诺基亚的这个侵权通知，我们才能了解到这个有趣的项目：开发一款满足基本使用、注重隐私的小型 Linux 手机。

该项目的目标是设计一个完全适合诺基亚经典手机外壳的 PCB。



到目前为止，该项目已经支持许多硬件相关的功能，包括蓝牙和 Wi-Fi。

该项目不基于安卓，而是基于主线 Linux 内核。

你可以在他们的 官方博文 中，了解有关该项目和计划中的手机规格。

目前，该项目正在等待筹款，以便可以单独购买早期原型机。

灵感来自诺基亚，并受到诺基亚的关注

嗯，该项目清楚地表明他们受到诺基亚经典手机的启发，他们并没有试图误导任何贡献者和潜在客户。

该项目的创建者在推特上分享了诺基亚的电子邮件，同时他提到，诺基亚在将此类通知发送给以社区利益为主导的项目之前，应该更谨慎一些才对。


再次阅读 @Nokia 的邮件后，我开始感到愤怒。这无非是一场精心策划的演出。既然它是一个协作项目，并且得到了世界各地的人们的贡献，因此，我将把完整的电子邮件发布给它的“预期收件人”。




此外，他们确认该项目将更名。

当然，作为一个开源项目，它应该和诺基亚是扯不上关系的，除非他们使用诺基亚的品牌名称销售他们的原型/手机。

但是，在目前的状态下，这更像是一个激情项目，是开源爱好者社区协作努力的成果。因此，向他们发出侵犯诺基亚权利的通知，听起来实在有些牵强。

对吗？

当然，对于一般企业来说，这并不奇怪；但对于诺基亚来说，这未免有点过于谨慎和反竞争了。

更何况，我们可以肯定地说，诺基亚的最新的智能手机的表现，并没有达到用户的预期。

有趣的是，一位推特用户发现，还有一家名为 “Notkia” 的 IT 公司。他们是否也收到了诺基亚的通知？呵呵，谁知道呢。

那么，你如何看待这个基于 Linux 的袖珍手机的开源项目呢？在下面的评论中分享你的看法吧！

 Currently what I do is that:
 I put all of my notes, files and logs in a git repo on my desktop computer at home and push it to github and then I clone it on my work computer. Then if I make any changes there, I push it to github and then I pull the changes to my home computer.
 But this is creating so many unnecessary commits just to sync my files across the devices.
 Is there a more elegant way or a program? I hate google drive, the interface is really ugly an d slow and I can't sync them all easily and I can't use it from command line.

 来源：澎湃新闻
                

黄心村（章静绘）
香港大学比较文学系的黄心村教授就读于加利福尼亚大学洛杉矶分校时，博士论文即以张爱玲为题。此后，她在威斯康辛大学执教多年，研究领域扩展到二十世纪华语文学、东亚跨文化研究和视听文化研究。五年前，黄教授来到香港大学，借着筹办张爱玲百年诞辰在线展览的机会，重拾张爱玲研究。她有意识地运用上述诸领域的研究方法，利用新鲜出土的材料，辅以“焦距的调整”，最终在新著《缘起香港：张爱玲的异乡和世界》中展现了一个崭新、迷人的世界，大大深化了我们对张爱玲的认识。在接受《上海书评》的采访时，她谈到了我们要在何种参照系下怎样重新阅读张爱玲：不能简单地将她与同时代的作家相比，而是要“从张爱玲重新出发”，去挖掘她背后更加丰富、深邃的文本空间与创作源头——不仅仅包括她的文字写作，还有她的图像创作、她对设计的理解……
《缘起香港：张爱玲的异乡和世界》，黄心村著，香港中文大学出版社，2022年7月
您的新著《缘起香港》以张爱玲在香港大学的求学经历为起点，还原她在港大的住所、课堂，而且您重走了张爱玲曾经上学的道路，爬了她曾经爬过的山坡，也考证了她的写作与她的历史老师佛朗士、中文老师许地山之间的渊源。您指出，今天的港大中文学院大致沿袭了当年许地山拟定的格局。能否请您谈谈港大中文学院的现状？今天港大中文学院的师生对张爱玲的香港经历是否还有一些共同的记忆和体验？
重走张爱玲上学路：沿宝珊道往山下走，当年的山路没有沥青铺面，应该比较窄，但路边的护坡石墙和根须盘绕的细叶大榕树应该在张爱玲的时代就有了。黄心村摄于2022年2月。
黄心村：港大中文学院目前的结构确实跟当年许地山改组以后的结构相差不大，可见许地山当年的理念是超前的，他用一种现代的学科整合的方式、角度来重新设置了中文系的课程。张爱玲当年上学的时候，主科是英文和历史，辅科修的是中文，包括…]]></summary>

 Official release notes: https://github.com/labwc/labwc/releases/tag/0.5.3
 Added:
  
 wlr-output-power-management protocol to enable clients such as wlopm Written-by: @bi4k8
  
Fixed:
  
Call foreign-toplevel-destroy when unmapping xwayland surfaces because some xwayland clients leave unmapped child views around. Although handle_destroy() is not called for these, we have to call foreign-toplevel-destroy to avoid clients such as panels incorrecly showing them.
 
Handle xwayland set_override_redirect events to fix weird behaviour with gitk menus and rofi.
 
Re-focus parent surface on unmapping xwayland unmanaged surfaces.
 
Fixes #352 relating to JetBrains and Intellij focus issues.
 
Written-by: Jelle De Loecker.
 
Do not segfault on missing drag icon. Written-by: @Consolatis.
 
Fix windows irratically sticking to edges during move/resize. Fixes issues #331 and #309

But when you start using flatpaks for other apps such as steam, it breaks things, modding doesn’t work, etc. flatpaks are great but should be only used in certain cases.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello,
This is a portfolio optimizer I made to help select portfolios for my clients. I'm a personal financial adviser. I generally put my clients in a mix of low-fee index funds and ETFs and I use this to set an appropriate allocation based on the client's risk tolerance.
I have been working on this as a side project to 1) improve the theoretical underpinnings of my investment recommendations and 2) improve my coding skills with frameworks like Vue and Torch. Here's the repository for the frontend: https://github.com/justinluther502/cashgraphfront.
The frontend site is Vue 2 + Vuetify, and the backend is an AWS lambda function running the Torch optimizer. I am still working out kinks in the backend, particularly cold-start issues because the Lambda function has to load the entire Torch library (~2GB). This occasionally causes the AWS API Gateway to reach max timeout before the Lambda function finishes. Any tips on addressing this would be much appreciated. My first thought is maybe to pare down the Torch library used in the Lambda function because I am only using a small subset of the full library.
The optimizer function itself is designed to overcome several classic shortcomings in Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT) (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modern_portfolio_theory). Unlike textbook implementations of MPT, this optimizer can utilize non-normal returns distributions, risk metrics besides variance, and can allow the user to specify tail behavior, such as asset correlations behaving normally most of the time but converging to 1.0 in severe downturns. Most of these "fixes" happen during the generation of custom "flavors", or asset selection universes. I have 3 flavors pre-built and there is some information on how they are constructed in the flavor selection page.
Any feedback greatly appreciated!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[谷歌从安卓中移除大量 Fuchsia 代码

本周，谷歌从安卓开源项目（AOSP）中移除了大量关于 Fuchsia 设备的代码。在谷歌的设想中，Fuchsia 设备可以运行来自安卓和 Linux 等其他系统的应用程序。想要达成这个目标有多种途径，谷歌最早尝试的是在一个虚拟机上运行完整的安卓系统实例，但这存在一些潜在的性能问题。另一种方式就是增强 Fuchsia 和安卓运行时环境的直接关系，在 2019 年时谷歌在 AOSP 里创建了一个项目，能够为 Fuchsia 设备创建安卓运行时。这次这些代码的移除，正式标志着这种方式的终结。在留下的 TODO 信息里，表明谷歌正在创建一个新的 “Starnix” 项目，让 Fuchsia 能够“原生”运行为 Linux/安卓开发的应用和库，即一个从 Linux 的底层内核架构到 Fuchsia 的 Zircon 内核的翻译层。


消息来源：9to5google



老王点评：其实，谷歌在操作系统方面的野心很大，只是一直被掩盖在 Windows 和 Mac 下面没那么引人注意。




openSUSE 率先对 Nim 语言提供支持

Nim 语言 是一种新兴的语言，创建于 2005 年。这种经过编译的静态类型的编程语言有一个外部函数接口，可以与 C/C++、JavaScript 和其他语言交互。Nim 自称“结合了 Python、Ada 和 Modula 等成熟语言的成功概念”，以前曾被称为像 C 一样快，又像 Python 一样具有表现力、像 Lisp 编程语言一样可扩展。openSUSE 不仅宣布为 Nim 语言提供最新的软件包，而且对这个静态类型、命令式编程语言的提供一级支持。Nim 的作者及社区对 openSUSE 提供一级支持表示欢欣鼓舞。


消息来源：Phoronix



老王点评：很多新兴语言都雄心勃勃，但是一种编程语言要成功，真有时候有很多侥幸的地方。




Rocky Linux 9.0 发布

Rocky Linux 9.0 建立在 RHEL 9.0 的基础上，并计划支持近十年，直到 2032 年 5 月。现有的Rocky Linux 8 将继续被支持到 2029 年 5 月。Rocky Linux 渴望成为 CentOS Stream 之前的 CentOS。由于使用了红帽企业 Linux 9.0 的源代码，它的所有功能与 5 月份达到 GA 的那个 RHEL 发行版相同。


消息来源：Phoronix



老王点评：从目前看起来，Rocky Linux 和 Alma Linux 是最肖似 CentOS 的继承者了。]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[试试这个轻量级的开源工具，不用离开终端就可以预览文件。




查看你的文件和文件夹的最基本方法是使用命令 ls 和 ll。但是有时候，我不仅想看到文件的元数据，还想一目了然地看到文件的内容。为此，我使用 ranger。

如果你喜欢在控制台中工作，并使用 Vim 或 Vi，而且你不想因为任何原因离开你的终端，那么 ranger 就是你最好的新朋友。ranger 是一个精简的文件管理器，它不仅可以让你浏览文件，还可以预览它们。ranger 与 rifle 捆绑在一起，rifle 是一个文件执行器，可以有效地选择与特定文件类型相关的程序。

在 Linux 上安装 ranger

ranger 可以在 Fedora 或任何基于 RPM 的发行版中安装，方法是运行：

$ sudo dnf install ranger


ranger 也可以用于 其他发行版和 macOS。

第一次使用 ranger

作为一个用户，你可以在你喜欢的终端上简单地输入 ranger 来启动 ranger。可以用方向键浏览。这张截图是一个很好的例子，我可以预览存储在 Kernel-tests 中的 config.example 文件的代码。



选中任何文件并按下 F4 键，就可以打开你的默认编辑器，让你立即编辑这些文件！

图像和视频怎么办？

使用 rifle 和 ranger 可以让你快速找到与某一文件相关的程序。将鼠标悬停在图片上，然后试图打开它是非常简单的，只要点击回车即可。下面是它的样子：



在一个图像文件上点击 i 会给用户提供所有的 EXIF 数据。点击 Shift+Enter 将打开这个 PDF 文件。



同样的组合键将在系统默认的支持该编解码器的视频播放器中打开并开始播放视频。下面的例子是一个 mp4 视频，它在 VLC 上播放得很好。



文件操作

除非 Vim 用户另有配置，否则下面的键绑定工作良好。


j：下移

k：上移

h: 移动到父目录

gg：移到列表的顶部

i：预览文件

r：打开文件

zh：查看隐藏文件

cw：重命名当前文件

yy：复制文件

dd：剪切文件

pp：粘贴文件

u：撤销

z：改变设置

dD：删除文件


控制台命令

有时我在起草文章时，有一个文件夹包含某个软件的截图。通过点击空格选择或标记文件，然后输入 :bulkrename，可以帮助我把所有奇怪的时间戳变成如：lorax1、lorax2 等等。下面是一个例子。



其他有用的控制台命令包括：


penwith：用你选择的程序打开一个选择的文件

:touch FILENAME：创建一个文件

:mkdir FILENAME：创建一个目录

:shell <command>：在 shell 中运行一个命令

:delete：删除文件


在 tty2/3/4 中能工作吗？

作为一个从事质量保证（QA）工作的人，我发现搜索日志和阅读日志从未如此简单。即使我的 Gnome 显示管理器崩溃了，我也可以切换到我的 tty2，用我的用户名和密码登录，并以超级用户权限启动 ranger，然后我就可以尽情地探索了！

ranger 是一个很好的工具，可以在不离开终端的情况下处理文件。ranger 是精简的，也是可定制的，所以不妨一试吧！

祝总斌先生走了。悲痛之中，想起许多和他有关的往事。

祝先生的学术专长主要是秦汉魏晋南北朝史、中国古代政治制度史、中国古代法治史。他开设的相关课程，在学生中很受欢迎。但我上本科时想学中国思想史，对这些学科都不大感兴趣，所以没听过祝先生的课。事后想起来，颇感遗憾。我第一次和祝先生接触，是本科四年级写毕业论文时。系里让同学们自报论文题目，由各位老师根据自己的专长和兴趣来认领，无人认领的则由教研室主任负责。我报的题目是“商周时期孝观念的起源、发展及其社会原因”。不出意料，果然无人认领。祝先生是中国古代史教研室主任，于是便成了我的学士论文指导教师。第一次去家里找他谈论文，见他穿一件旧棉袄，腰里系着一根绳。家里没有书房，他在卧室中工作。卧室一面墙都是书架，摆满了书。没有写字台和座椅，他就坐在床边，在一张中学生用的小课桌上读书写作。我当时产生一个念头，长时间这么坐着，没有靠背，腰受得了吗？我的论文是三年级写的习作，经过反复修改，已经比较成熟。祝先生看后，没提太多修改意见，只是要求我对一条转引的材料去查找核对原始出处。史料一定不能转引，这是祝先生教我的第一条做学问的规矩。
祝总斌先生在家中
1983年考研，我选了魏晋南北朝史方向，祝先生是我的研究生导师。本科四年，说实话，我没学到太多东西，对历史学懵懵懂懂，还没入门。硕士三年，跟着祝先生学习，才逐渐摸到了治学的门道。祝先生指导我们十分用心。除了选修他在系里开设的课程外，我们还要上一门《通鉴》读书课，每周读三卷，两周讨论一次。这时祝先生已经住进中关园宿舍，有了书房，读书课就在书房里上。每次上课前，他都会预先做准备，翻看要讨论的内容，还会把椅子摆好，并在我们的座位前各放一杯茶和一块糖，很温馨。第一次系统阅读史料书，问题当然会很多。祝先生总是不厌其烦地解答我们的问题，…]]></summary>

《本雅明传》，[美]霍华德·艾兰、迈克尔·詹宁斯著，王璞译，上海文艺出版社，2022年7月出版，908页，145.00元
“欧洲现代性的见证”和“多重”自我

在评传第一页上，两位作者称本雅明为“欧洲现代性”的“重要见证”，以此为“细节”纺织的机杼，提供出“批评之生命”的基本历史索引。这是怎样的欧罗巴啊——两次世界大战酝酿于此，并最终降下“铁”雨（借用布莱希特的著名比喻）。本雅明小时候亲历了柏林崛起为现代都会，沐浴在德意志第二帝国的余晖之中。他父亲不断置业，他们全家最终搬进新区的豪宅，这也可以当作德国资本主义大发展的一页史料。出身于犹太富人之家，不满于传统教育模式，学生本雅明在“一战”前参与“青年运动”，试图以新一代人的精神强度来改造死气沉沉的德国社会。而和许多同代中欧知识人一样，他在“一战”中经历了友人的自戕，一生都无法从中走出。本雅明的成年生活主要是在两次世界大战之间度过的，他被欧洲学院体制拒之门外，却又活跃于“魏玛文化”之中。他是异类知识分子，也是欧洲先锋派运动的一员。他在绝大多数照片上都穿着正装，但又大胆尝试新媒介和新的生活样式，还是电台广播作者。他不仅热爱浪游，而且访问过莫斯科，那里有试图克服资本主义的“组织生活”。然而法西斯主义化为笼罩全欧的黑云，他曾在意大利的岛屿上见识过墨索里尼的巡游，纳粹控制德国之后，他以巴黎为中心，度过了流亡岁月。他的死因是——他没有逃离欧罗巴的“通道”（法文中“通道”和“拱廊街”为同一词）。本雅明在书信中说，在逼近“二战”的日子里，欧洲的“大气层”饱含泪水，“希望”就像稀有的“信号弹”，偶尔才升起。本雅明“见证”的，是欧洲现代性的所有灯光在幻景般闪烁后又一盏盏熄灭，是整个布尔乔亚文明在二十世纪的多重转变、全面危机和总体内爆。

你可以先在 VirtualBox 中尝试安装 Arch Linux，看看它是否是你想在实际硬件上运行的系统。通过这种方式，你可以在不弄乱当前操作系统的情况下体验 Arch Linux。

在本文，我将一步一步指导你完成一个实用的 Arch Linux 虚拟机的安装过程。

在 VirtualBox 上安装 Arch Linux

毫无疑问，你需要先 在 Linux 上安装 VirtualBox（或在 Windows 上）。在 Windows 上，只需访问 Oracle 的网站并下载 VirtualBox。


下载 VirtualBox


如果你使用的是 Windows 10 或更高版本，请确保你的系统已启用虚拟化。

完成后，你需要到 Arch Linux 官方网站 下载 ISO 文件。你应该找到 使用 torrent 下载 或直接下载文件的选项。



你可以保留 ISO 文件以备不时之需，安装成功后也可以将其删除以 释放系统上的空间。

现在，让我们开始在 VirtualBox 上安装 Arch Linux 吧。

第一部分 创建虚拟机

第一步：首先，你需要在 VirtualBox 中设置一下。启动 VirtualBox 并单击 “新建New” 来创建一个虚拟机。



注意，你可以使用 “向导模式guided mode” 继续创建虚拟机，但使用 “专家模式expert mode” 可以一目了然地获得更多选项。



因此，我推荐使用…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[我喜欢 在 Ubuntu 中使用深色模式。在我看来深色模式能够缓解视觉疲劳，让系统看起来更加的赏心悦目。

我发现了一个 gedit 文本编辑器的小麻烦，如果你在深色模式下使用它，你也许也会遇到。

默认情况下 gedit 高亮当前光标所在的行。这是一个非常有用的功能，但是如果你在 Linux 系统中开启了深色模式，那么你将会感到痛苦。为什么？因为被高亮的文本将不再变得可读。你自己看吧：



如果你选择文本，它将变得可读，但这并不是一个让人感到有多么愉快的阅读或者编辑体验。（LCTT 校注：在新的 Ubuntu 22.04 中，这一情况已经有所改善，“高亮当前行”已被取消勾选）



好消息是你不需要再忍受它。我将演示几个步骤让你能够同时享受 gedit 以及系统的深色模式。

让 gedit 在深色模式下阅读体验友好

你基本上有两个选择：


禁用高亮当前行，但也同时意味着你必须清楚地知道你在哪一行。

改变默认的颜色设置，但编辑器的颜色会变得稍微有些不同，而且如果你更改系统主题，它不会自动切换到浅色模式。


在 gedit 或者 GNOME 的开发者解决这个问题之前，这是你必须要做的应变和妥协。

选项1： 禁止高亮当前行

当你打开 gedit 后，点击汉堡菜单然后选择“首选项Preferences”。



在查看选项卡，你应该看到在 “高亮Highlighting” 区域的下方的 “高亮当前行Highlight current line” 选项。取消勾选这个选项，马上就可以看到效果。



“高亮当前行”是一个有用的功能，如果你想继续使用它，请选择第二个选项。

选项2： 更改编辑器的颜色主题

在“首选项Preferences”窗口，找到 “字体与颜色Font & Colors” 标签页，然后将颜色主题更改为 “Oblivion”、“Solarized Dark”，或者 “Cobalt”。



正如我前面所提到的，缺点就是当你把系统主题切换为浅色模式时，编辑器将不会自动切换到浅色模式。

开发者应该修复的一个 bug

这里 有几个 Linux 可用的文本编辑器 ，但是为了快速阅读或编辑文本文件，我更推荐使用 gedit。尽管如此，小烦恼仍旧是小烦恼。开发者应该在将来的版本中为这个很好的文本编辑器修复这个问题，让我们不再求助于这些应对办法。

你呢？你在你的系统上使用深色模式还是浅色模式？你注意到 gedit 的这个问题了吗？你有使用什么方法去解决它吗？欢迎分享你的经验。

 Moving away from CentOS does pose a bit of challenge as requirements for me would be things like: 1. Still keeping inline with cost saving, it can’t be commercial licensed. 2.

4096-byte page on most systems.  It thus does not seem like a worrisome
level of overhead, and little effort has been made over the kernel's
history to reduce page-table memory consumption.  Those eight bytes can
hurt, though, if they are replicated across a sufficiently large set of

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[天风国际知名苹果分析师郭明錤在推特表示，根据对分销商、零售商、黄牛的调查，中国渠道普遍都看好苹果即将发售的iPhone 14系列，他们认为iPhone 14系列需求量会超过iPhone 13系列。为此，该些人不得不为iPhone 14支付“有史以来最多的预付定金”，以确保稳定供应。


　　郭明錤指出，目前在中国市场上，苹果iPhone 14的预付定金明显高于iPhone 13系列，甚至在某些地区足足高出一倍。


　　郭明錤表示，这可能是因为在华为退出5G智能手机市场后，苹果目前几乎霸占了整个中国高端智能手机市场。这也意味着中国市场潜在的高端iPhone用户数量有所增加。


　　预付定金是在上市前确保即将到来的智能手机供应的费用，比iPhone 13"明显高"，在一些地区，它比之前的产品阵容高一倍之多。


　　"组件供应商和EMS的iPhone 14出货量预测在22年下半年分别约为1亿和9000万台，"郭明錤写道。"中国市场对iPhone 14的稳固需求可能会减少市场对iPhone 14上市后削减订单风险的担忧。"供应链消息人士还重申，之前传出的iPhone 14首批订单被砍的传闻，完全就是谣言，非但没有砍，苹果还在加单iPhone 13系列，真的是产销两旺的局面。

several days, according to Greg
Kroah-Hartman, due to problems that have come up with the Retbleed
mitigation patches.


	 The problems are purely due to the fact that we were forced to do
	 this type of work "in private" with very limited ability for
	 testing by the normal larger kernel community like we rely on.  We
	 don't have fancy or huge private testing labs where we can do all
	 of this work as we are an open source project, and we rely on open
	 testing in public.


The ongoing problems might yet slow down the 5.19 release as well.

Update: there has actually been a different set of updates
released:
5.18.12,
5.15.55,
5.10.131, and
5.4.206.  These revert a single problematic

 I feel more "productive" because I use the keyboard all the time and most shortcuts from the apps I use are similar to Vim (hjkl, ctrl+d, ctrl+u, etc).
 And my PC is a laptop, so touchpad is terrible, but now my laptop will be stationary since I don't need to travel for work anymore so I have full access to an external mouse and keyboard all the time.
 I'll write some workflow example:
 I use CMUS for music and nnn for file management.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[谷歌正式推出可装在普通电脑的 ChromeOS Flex 操作系统

ChromeOS Flex 是一个基于 ChromeOS、兼容大部分硬件的操作系统，谷歌官方表示经过验证的设备已经“超过 400 款”。ChromeOS Flex 可以下载到 USB 设备中，然后在 Mac 或者 Windows 设备上进行安装。它于今年 2 月推出，主要基于谷歌在 2020 年收购的 CloudReady 的技术。它最大的优势就是能够让老旧设备“焕发生机”，尤其是那些原生系统已经无法再获得软件更新的设备。在未经谷歌认证的设备上同样可以安装 ChromeOS Flex，只要这些设备符合官方的最低要求。


消息来源：谷歌



老王点评：不知道是不是和 ChromeOS 一样，需要那种不一样的网络？




尼康停止单反相机的开发

配备高清摄像头的智能手机正在侵蚀相机市场，尼康表示今后将专注于开发逐渐在市场上成为主流的、引进人工智能和图像处理技术的无反相机。尼康在 1959 年推出首款单反相机 Nikon F，自 2020 年 6 月推出面向专业人士的旗舰机型 D6 后，再未推出过单反相机的新产品。单反相机的优势是可以根据被拍摄物体和摄影环境更换镜头。尼康在单反相机的销量份额上仅次于佳能，排在世界第 2 位。佳能也计划在数年内结束单反相机的旗舰机型的开发。


消息来源：日经中文网



老王点评：单反相机估计没想到它的敌人是智能手机吧。




谷歌高管认为 Instagram 和 TikTok 在侵蚀该公司核心产品

TikTok 对谷歌业务的威胁不限于视频服务 YouTube，谷歌公司高管承认 Instagram 和 TikTok 危及到了公司核心产品：搜索和地图。新一代的用户的搜索习惯和以前的用户不同，他们不是输入查询词，而是倾向于通过更沉浸的方式发现内容。比如在搜寻餐馆时，四成的年轻人不是打开谷歌地图或搜索，而是打开 TikTok 或 Instagram。


消息来源：Tech Crunch



老王点评：和单反的情况类似，打败搜索的不是更好的搜索，反而是其它的产品。]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[为何小小的单板机是智能工作以及小型办公室的未来。




随着疫情的大流行，我们的工作方式也正在发生着改变。工作的分散化正在成为所有公司需要面临的一项重要挑战。

智能办公室

即使工厂认为智能办公仅仅是通过虚拟私有网络来对员工的笔记本电脑进行远程控制，再稍微增加一点进化也可以让一些基本的办公服务离人们更近一点，这些都能够极大降低数据中心的负载，并且提高人们的工作体验。这个方案还有一个额外的影响就是从信息和通信技术（ICT）上来说消除了许多单点故障。

与其在公司外部有成百上千的工作场地，不如在世界范围内有着成百上千的小型办公室/分支，这就是所谓的“智能办公室”。

这种表述可能会让许多 ICT 专家感到恐慌，因为这种文化使得每个办公室都与一台大机器（即服务器）联系在一起，即使分散计算资源的优势非常明显。

一个不同的角度

如果你能用一块 50 美元的小开发板提供一个大服务器的服务会怎么样？如果这个小板子只需要一张 SD 卡和一个普通的 USB 电源支持，那又会怎么样呢？这就是 树莓派 是最灵活的解决方案的原因所在。

树莓派开发板是尺寸非常小的运行 Linux 的计算机。它有一个由树莓派基金会提供和维护的操作系统：树莓派操作系统Raspberry Pi OS。它基于 Debian，并与这个最知名的 Linux 发行版共享许多软件包。此外，许多树莓派的开发板能够完美运行最知名的 Ubuntu 服务器，它涵盖了 ARM 处理器支持，提供了对低功耗处理器的支持。

但树莓派开发板对小公司来说也是一个很好的机会，以能够承担得起的代价获得大量的（开源）服务。但这种情况下，你必须考虑数据丢失的风险，因为你把所有的服务运行在一个小的、消费级的硬件上。不过设置正确的备份/恢复程序能够降低这些风险。

你能从树莓派开发板上提供什么服务？

大多数服务通常由更昂贵的服务器提供。这里的“大多数”取决于一些限制：


ARM 处理器： 一些软件包只支持 x86/x64 处理器。这是最难克服的挑战之一。但另一方面，ARM 处理器的市场份额不断增长，使得程序员为他们的软件开发了兼容 ARM 处理器的版本。

内存容量： 这是一个仅限于在复杂应用以复杂的方式进行复杂的计算的情况下讨论的问题。很多时候，这只不过是关于重新审查代码、拆分步骤，并保持简单高效的问题。此外，如果一个服务虽然只服务少数几个用户，但需要大量的内存/CPU，这大概也意味着此服务没有正常工作。这可能是你消除浪费资源的旧问题的一个机会。最后，最新的树莓派开发板把内存容量升级到了 8GB，这是一个很大的提升。

对服务器没有经验的用户： 这是另一个问题，你可以在基础镜像所在的树莓派的 micro-SD 卡中存储系统和运行数据。


也就是说，你能够用树莓派做很多有趣的事情。在 我的博客 里，我通过运行各种服务进行了测试 —— 从基本的 LAMP 服务器到复杂的 CRM。从简单到复杂系统，全部都是开源的，例如：


代理服务器（也能够添加广告拦截服务）

电子邮件服务器

打印服务器

酒店管理

联系关系管理（CRM）

私人社交网络

私人论坛

私有 Git 门户网站

网络监控服务器

许多其他有用的服务


对树莓派来说，另一个有趣的用法是在你的远程办公室获得提供高级服务的 Wi-Fi 热点，并且可以从它的以太网端口进行控制。

最后，树莓派也能够运行容器，这是一个额外的工具，从这个不可思议的开发板中获得一个可用的服务世界。

《本雅明传》，[美]霍华德·艾兰、迈克尔·詹宁斯著，王璞译，上海文艺出版社，2022年7月出版，908页，145.00元
“矛盾而流动的整体”

“……我多元的信念所代表的那个矛盾而流动的整体”——二十世纪犹太裔德国批评家、理论家和文人瓦尔特·本雅明（1892-1940）曾如此形容自己的思想生活。他的多样作品、不幸经历以及迟来的声名，不论在英语世界还是中文世界，都仍然散发出近乎奥义般的吸引力。2014年夏天，最初接到翻译Walter Benjamin: A Critical Life的邀请时，我一口答应，几乎不假思索。这部传记，“英语中第一部完整的”本雅明传，出自霍华德·艾兰（Howard Eiland）和迈克尔·W. 詹宁斯（Michael W. Jennings）的“四手联弹”。我上大学在图书馆乱翻瓦尔特·本雅明著作英译本时，已经注意到这两位本雅明专家的名字。艾兰曾长期担任麻省理工学院的文学讲师；詹宁斯则是普林斯顿大学的德语系教授。从二十世纪九十年代起，在编辑林赛水（Lindsay Waters）的强力推动下，哈佛大学出版社成为本雅明著作英语译介的重镇，这两位学者的努力和配合贯穿于哈佛社版四卷本《瓦尔特·本雅明文选》（Walter Benjamin: Selected Writings）的编译工作。从1996年至2003年，这套选集终于出齐，时至今日仍是英语世界对本雅明作品的一份相对完备的呈现。同时，艾兰也是本雅明遗稿《拱廊街计划》（The Arcades Project）和专题选集《现代生活的作家——论波德莱尔》（The Writer of Modern Life: Essays on Charles Baudelaire）的英译者之一。而詹宁斯不仅编辑了《现代生活的作家》，还是《可技术复…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi HN.
I built Payload to make file transfers easy for less-technical users who need large/fast transfers, so I have focused on auto-discovery, drag-and-drop, visually distinct device icons.
It's using Tauri (an "Electron alternative" built on Rust) which keeps my binaries small and bundles to .msi, .dmg, .deb and .appimage. No CLI, iOS or Android support (yet).
The network stack is a separate binary written in Go. It uses mDNS for local network discovery and TLS over TCP or Quic, with a public Ed25519 keypair for each device. The protocol is ad-hoc and symmetrical control stream using JSON and binary data streams. Planning to open source these parts eventually..
Transfers should saturate the local network link. It reaches ~116 MB/s wired at my home, but if you have a >1000 Mbit link, I'd be curious to see how much speed you can squeeze out.

 Recently a Chinese novelists claimed that his draft with about 1 million words got "locked" due to the file being "against the regulations". Notice that the user claimed that it's not just the file on the cloud that got banned, but the local file also got locked. Despite WPS's repeated denials, many other users also reported similar incidents.
 I decided to post it here because many users in Linux community use WPS as an alternative to MS office. While this problem may or may not apply to non-Chinese or linux users, who most likely use a different version from what most Chinese users use on Windows, this is a reminder that you should avoid any Chinese software if possible unless it's a battle-tested open source software.

programmers to write programs that can run safely in kernel space. All
memory accesses and function calls in BPF programs are statically checked
for safety using the in-kernel verifier, which
analyzes programs in their entirety before allowing them to be loaded.
While this allows the kernel to safely run BPF programs, it heavily
restricts what those programs are able to do. Among these
constraints is a rule that programs cannot store pointers into BPF maps for
use (such as dereferencing them or passing them to the kernel in
kfunc and BPF helper invocations) at a
later time. A
patch set by
Kumar Kartikeya Dwivedi adds this capability to BPF.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[微软联合创始人比尔·盖茨宣布将自己的全部财产捐给与他前妻梅琳达·弗伦奇·盖茨共同领导的慈善基金会，从而退出全球富豪榜。而且，作为一项直接措施，这位微软创始人13日宣布再向基金会注资200亿美元。


　　作为全球规模最大的基金会之一，比尔及梅琳达·盖茨基金会则宣布，得益于新获资金，计划到2026年将其在全球健康、减贫及平等方面的年度支出增加50%。基金会的目标是，应对正在撼动地球的“不断加剧的多重全球危机”。


　　根据彭博的亿万富翁指数，比尔·盖茨的净资产约1140 亿美元，目前在全球富豪榜排名第四。盖茨也声称其通过捐款逐步减少自己的财富，并最终脱离世界首富的名号。沃伦·巴菲特上个月也向盖茨基金会捐资31亿美元。这两笔捐资将使盖茨基金会的总资金达到约700亿美元。盖茨的捐款将使基金会能在2026年前将每年的项目支出提高50%，达到90亿美元。盖茨还提到新冠、俄乌冲突、气候变化与通货膨胀加在一起，促使基金会有必要在关注的核心领域投入更多资源，这些领域包括卫生、教育、性别均等和减贫。


　　报道称，比尔·盖茨在他的博客上解释道：“展望未来，我计划将自己的全部财富捐给基金会，除了我花在自己和家人身上的钱之外。”


　　他说：“在基金会之外，我还对包括阿尔茨海默症在内的美国医疗保健问题捐赠和投资了一些资金。通过‘突破能源联盟’，我将继续为应对气候变化投资和捐献资金。总的来说，我希望这些领域的工作能够盈利，而这些钱也会流向基金会。我将从全球富豪榜上跌落，最终消失。捐钱对我而言不是牺牲。我很荣幸能够参与应对这些巨大挑战。我享受这项工作，并且相信我有义务以最能改善生活的方式将我的资源回馈社会。”


　　据彭博社报道，这笔捐款相当于比尔·盖茨财产的五分之一。据《福布斯》杂志报道，这对前夫妻迄今为止共捐赠了约550亿美元，而这笔捐款使比尔·盖茨在全球富豪榜上滑落一位，位列第五。


　　报道称，2010年，比尔·盖茨和梅琳达·盖茨与大亨沃伦·巴菲特发起“捐助承诺”运动，当时有40个亿万富翁或家庭加入，现已有400多位签署者。参与者要承诺将大部分财产捐赠给慈善事业，“以解决社会上一些最紧迫的问题”。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[谷歌披露其内部使用的 Linux 滚动发行版

谷歌早期使用的内部 Linux 发行版是基于 Ubuntu LTS 的 Goobuntu。Ubuntu LTS 需要每隔两年更新一次，这对于需要升级几十万台计算机的谷歌来说并非易事。因此谷歌转向了滚动更新发行版，它没有使用著名的滚动更新发行版，如 Arch Linux，而是基于 Debian 测试分支构建了自己的滚动发行版。它将新发行版称为 gLinux Rodete（是 Rolling Debian Testing 的缩写）。Debian 测试分支是滚动更新的。谷歌引入了名为 Sieve 的工作流系统，使用虚拟化测试套装确保软件包新版本不会破坏核心组件和开发者的工作流程。谷歌于 2018 年底完成迁移，次年关闭了剩余的 Goobuntu。

老王点评：谷歌的这个经验其实可以供其它的大型 IT 企业参考。




谷歌云宣布采用 ARM 芯片

谷歌云周三宣布，他们将开始采用基于 ARM 技术的芯片。随着谷歌加入 ARM 阵营，几乎所有大型云服务提供商现在都已经开始提供基于 ARM 的云计算服务。谷歌云的新服务将基于 Ampere 公司的 Altra 芯片，该公司还向微软和甲骨文等企业出售芯片。另外一些云计算提供商，如甲骨文、阿里云则在设计自己的 ARM 架构芯片，并且已经委托工厂进行生产。

老王点评：ARM 和 RISC-V 大行其道，我想英特尔和 AMD 感受到压力了吧。




去年几乎整个工业行业都受到过攻击

《2022 年工业安全状况报告》调查了 800 名负责这些工业系统的高级 IT 和安全负责人。报告发现，94% 的受访者在过去 12 个月里，其工业物联网（IIoT）或运营技术（OT）系统经历了某种形式的攻击。关键基础设施是网络犯罪分子的一个有吸引力的目标，但不幸的是，IIoT/OT 安全项目往往被其他安全举措所取代，或者由于成本或复杂性而失败，使组织处于风险之中。


消息来源：CSO Online



老王点评：其实工业互联网真没体验过互联网那么疯狂的攻击力度。至少互联网企业大多都有网络安全相关人员，工业互联网很少有专门配置的网络安全人员。]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[massCode 是一个开源的代码片段管理器，使你能够涉足代码，提高生产力，并节省时间。




如果一个工具能让事情变得更快、更有效率，那对许多开发者来说就是救命稻草。

虽然有各种服务和平台试图使编码体验更快，但你仍然有其他几个选择可以考虑。

例如，代码片段管理器。使用代码片段管理器，你的目的是保存你想快速访问的代码片段。它更像是指定快捷方式，在你的程序中添加所需的代码。

这不是一个新的概念，但可用于这项工作的工具可能不完全是开源的。

幸运的是，我偶然发现了一个不错的项目，它为你提供了一个自由开源的片段管理器，即 massCode。

massCode：跨平台的开源片段管理器



massCode 是一个有用的代码片段管理器，具有一些基本功能。

它支持广泛的编程语言，还包括对 Markdown 的支持。你可以使用文件夹组织你的代码片段，添加标签等。

massCode 可用于 Linux、Windows 或 macOS。让我们来看看一些主要功能。

massCode 的特点



massCode 包括许多有用的功能。其中一些是：


多层次的文件夹结构

每个片段都可以存储在片段（标签）中

集成的编码编辑器 Ace

代码格式化或高亮显示

支持带预览的 Markdown

能够搜索片段

给你的代码段添加描述，以了解它的用途

各种深色/浅色主题可用

能够从 SnippetsLab 迁移

自动保存以帮助你保留你的工作

将其与云同步文件夹整合

支持 VSCode、Raycast 和 Alfred 的扩展


除了上述所有功能外，你还可以轻松地复制保存代码片段，只需点击一下。

对于自定义，你可以调整字体大小和系列、切换自动换行、高亮显示行、使用单引号或添加尾随命令，这要归功于 Prettier。

此外，一份片段可以有多个分片。因此，它使你有机会将其用于各种用例。

如前所述，你也可以通过改变同步文件夹的存储位置将其与你的任何云同步服务整合。



总的来说，它工作得很好，有一些局限性，比如缺乏将嵌套文件夹从 SnippetsLab 迁移到 masCode 的能力。

在 Linux 上安装 massCode

massCode 有 Snap 包，但不在 Snap 商店中。你可以直接下载该软件包，并使用以下命令来安装它：

sudo snap install --dangerous ~/Downloads/masscode_2.6.1_amd64.snap


我们的一份故障排除指南可以帮助你了解 snap 的 dangerous 选项。

你可以通过其 官方网站 或 GitHub 发布区 下载 Windows/MacOS 版。


massCode


你试过 massCode 吗？还有其他可用于 Linux 的代码片段管理器吗？请在下面的评论中告诉我你的想法。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[这篇教程演示如何使用脚本命令来发送自己的桌面通知与提醒。




有时候，来自脚本的视觉回馈是很有用的。例如，当一个脚本或计划任务完成时，一个长期运行的构建任务失败时，或者当脚本执行中出现了紧急问题时。桌面应用程序可以通过弹出通知来做到这一点，但脚本也可以做到这一点！你可以使用脚本命令来给自己发送桌面通知与提醒。



下面的代码是在 Linux 上编写和测试的。它也可以在 macOS 上运行，只需花点功夫。请参见最后一节 提示与技巧。

从 Linux 终端发送通知

要从 Linux 终端发送通知，请使用 notify-send 命令。运行 which notify-send 命令来查看它是否在于你的系统中。如果没有，请使用包管理器来安装它。

在 Fedora 上，输入：

$ sudo dnf install notify-send


在基于 Debian 的发行版上，输入：

$ sudo apt install notify-send


几个简单的通知示例：

$ notify-send "Dinner ready!"
$ notify-send "Tip of the Day" "How about a nap?"


你可以用紧急程度、自定义图标等选项来自定义通知。过 man notify-send 了解更多。你也可以在通知正文中使用一小组 HTML 标记，以使消息有一个棒的视觉感受。最重要的是，URL 被呈现为可点击的。例如：

$ notify-send -u critical \
  "Build failed!" \
  "There were <b>123</b> errors. Click here to see the results: http://buildserver/latest"

《失落之城：四座世界古城的生与死》， [美] 安娜丽·纽伊茨著，朱敬文译，中信出版集团/新思文化，2022年6月版，78.00元
有些城市的生死命运经常不被关注，有可能是因为它们的规模、影响都比较小。当巨无霸式的中心大都市也出现政治危机、经济萧条、人口离散的迹象，却马上会成为预告某种趋势的象征，具有触目的警示意义。历史上那些曾经失落的伟大城市都经历过这样的演变进程，没有什么比伟大城市的衰亡故事更具有人类命运的象征意义。曾是文明的心脏，曾经以活力把无数人的生命点燃，最后为什么被掩埋在尘土之下？安娜丽·纽伊茨（Annalee Newitz）的《失落之城：四座世界古城的生与死》（原书名Four Lost Cities: A Secret History of the Urban Age ，2021；朱敬文译，中信出版社，2022年6月）把读者带到了遭遇政治动荡与自然灾害联手打击的城市衰亡历史现场，“它也将带来另一个反思：我们的城市是否也将在未来迎接一样落寞的终结？”这的确是值得推荐阅读的重要理由。

安娜丽·纽伊茨在该书中论述的第一个“失落之城”是建于约九千年前的新石器时代的恰塔霍裕克，这个遗址位于今天土耳其中部安纳托利亚地区的东西两座小山丘下。在这里顺带要说的是该书中译本的一个问题：书中所有的古代遗址与今天的地名以及所引述学者的人名后面都没有附上原文。当作者谈到这个“恰塔霍裕克”的住房户户相连、进出房屋要通过屋顶通道的楼梯口上下，我才想到所讲的这个遗址就是Çatalhöyük （Çatal Hüyük），中文译本多译作“加泰土丘”，我在大学二年级学世界史的时候看到的中译名则是“沙塔尔·休于”，那时还称其为“农村遗址”（《世界上古史纲》编写组《世界上古史纲》，上册，1979年，115页）。学术界关于这个遗址的性质是否属…]]></summary>

西安大雁塔与玄奘塑像
《西游记》是中国人家喻户晓的经典小说，讲的是唐僧师徒四人西天取经的故事，佛祖和观音为了考验取经团队，安排了很多妖怪一路阻挠，师徒四人一共经历了九九八十一难。其最后一难为“落水晒经书”，说的是通天河老鼋为师徒四人渡河帮忙，在河中间，老鼋问起自己拜托唐僧的事情，孰料唐僧忘记了，老鼋怒将师徒连同经书一同甩到河里，最后宝贵的经书虽然从河里捞出，却损毁了许多，留下无法弥补的缺憾。吴承恩以这个故事收尾既是基于历史上取经的一些事实，可能也寓有人生“抱残守缺”、实难圆满之意。国人都知《西游记》中的最后一难，却很少知道胡适先生曾经对这最后一难有过改作。以情节论，胡适的改作相当震撼，充满视觉想象力，如果将之改编为电影，说是一部限制级的暴力恐怖片也不为过。胡适如何想到改作《西游记》最后一难呢？大家知道，胡适在中国古代小说研究领域，是开风气之先的人物。他说：“十年前我曾对鲁迅先生说起《西游记》的第八十一难（九十九回）未免太寒碜了，应该大大的改作，才衬得住一部大书。我虽有此心，终无此闲暇，所以十年过去了，这件改作《西游记》的事终未实现。前几天，偶然高兴，写了这一篇，把《西游记》的第八十一难完全改作过了。”这篇文章发表于1934年的《学文月刊》上。

犹记二十年前，我在大学期间偶然读到胡适的这篇文章，印象远比“通天河遇鼋”来得深刻。其中诸多细节描写反映了胡适深厚的佛学造诣，隐伏着不少宗教意味。胡适在二十世纪二十至三十年代曾倾注了不少精力研究禅宗史，所以这篇改作也可算是他禅宗研究的成果。多年之后，我读到了罗马尼亚籍宗教史家米尔恰·伊利亚德（Mircea Eliade）的名著《萨满教：古老的入迷术》（Shamanism: Archaic Techniques of Ecstasy），联想起胡适改写的…]]></summary>

 来源：澎湃新闻
                
祝总斌先生家在中关园一幢老式的单元楼里。园子里草木葱茏，红砖外墙上长满了爬墙虎，颇有年代感。墙上纵横几道钢筋水泥的加固框架，有些煞风景，听说是唐山大地震后加上的。

我来北大念研究生时，祝先生已经退休有年，平时不容易在学校里见到。我便求着陈苏镇老师，哪回去看祝先生时带上我，让我见识见识这位写出了《两汉魏晋南北朝宰相制度研究》的大学者、老教授，导师的导师。陈老师似乎有些为难，但还是满足了我的愿望。
研究生拜访祝先生，右起：胡文波、王珊、孙正军、华喆、陈侃理，陈苏镇摄于2006年3月15日。
祝先生家比想象中要小。老户型三居室，客厅只容得下一张饭桌。三个房间，两间朝南的有一间做了书房，大约十二平米的样子。正中摆一张书桌，一把转椅，四壁都是书柜，顶天立地。进门处靠墙放了两只不大的单人沙发，沙发前有张茶几，茶几旁还有把铝合金折叠梯。这样，屋子就基本上挤满了，人在里面都转不开身。书桌、茶几、梯子上都放了书，堆得老高，更显得空间逼仄。回忆起来，祝先生就像是坐在书堆里。

那次的谈话，祝先生娓娓道来，跟我们聊了很多。内容不全记得了，但还能想起说了不少早年借书、读书、买书的事儿。我们问祝先生正在读什么书。祝先生兴致勃勃地讲起他的《红楼梦》研究，听着是“索隐派”的路数。第二年，这篇《董小宛入宫说始于何时》就发表了。

坐在书堆里的祝先生
过了几年，我毕业做博后，搬到中关新园宿舍，离祝先生家仅数十步之遥。那时先生八十岁了。我跟他说，我住得近，有什么可以帮忙的，您随时叫我。

那两年里，祝先生从来没有找过我。

直到留校工作，搬离中关新园，大约是2013年的一天，陈老师给我打电话，说祝先生在找你。我说，哦，是什么事儿啊？陈老师说，祝先生那儿有书让你去拿。我说，啊，这么好！到祝先生家，刚一落座，先生就指给我茶几上放好的几册精装书。有新城新藏的《东洋天文学史研究》、饭岛忠夫的《中国古代史と天文学》、能田忠亮的《东洋天文学史论丛》、陈遵妫的《中国天文学史》等，都是中国古代天文历法史的名著，但内容专深，是大多数历史学者不会碰的。有的书出版年代较早，还是日文版，在国内已属罕见。祝先生说：“你研究天文历法，用得着。”那时，我刚开始学习一点粗浅的历法知识，所谓“研究”还毫无眉目。翻看着书中祝先生的划线和批注，我吞吞吐吐地问：“这书，您不用了？”祝先生声音响亮，说：“我过去想研究，现在研究不动了。把书给你，希望你用得上，写出好文章来！”

书后来真的用上了。可几年之后我写出文章时，祝先生行动已经很不方便。我实在想象不出他在昏暗的书房里读那些文字的样子，也始终没有鼓起勇气问一句：“祝先生，您对文章有什么意见？”

那回同去的还有文超，祝先生给他选好了秦汉简牍方面的书。另有一套自创刊号以下完整无缺的《古文字研究》，托我转交给出土文献研究所。我们拿上书，先生又带着我们到各个屋里转，一会儿说：“这里的书好，你们要不要？”一会儿说：“来来来，看看这儿有什么，尽管挑，尽管拿。”我们就不客气了，各取所爱，卷走不少。这次我注意到，两个卧室里能放书柜的地方都放着书柜，每个书柜都塞得满满当当——甚至经我们席卷过后，看起来仍是满的。

后来依旧很少到祝先生家去，算来总数可能不会超过十次。去得频繁，是在2020年末到2021年初。连续三次，都是祝先生叫我去拿书。

那个冬天，四壁书柜里的书开始松动了。原来放成两排的，显露出藏在后面那排，有些书搬到地上，码得有半人高，有的已经装进纸箱、袋子。祝先生坐在轮椅里，划着圈儿到处指着，说：“你去那儿翻翻，这是不是你有用的。……阳台上也有。……对了，去隔壁看看，那儿还有历法、科技方面的书。”

我带了宜家的超大购物袋去，再要往里装时却有点迟疑。因为药物副作用，祝先生抬头很困难，我就蹲下来，跟他说话。讲了不多几句，他又催促我：“快，再去找找，再拿几本！”我慢慢起身，站在书柜前出神。这时，祝先生用力转过脸，歪着头，带着笑，大声说：“红粉送佳人，宝剑赠英雄。拿去就对了！”
祝先生1959年购买的《九朝律考》封面、扉页

祝先生在《九朝律考》书中的批注，可能是研究晋律“儒家化”的准备工作。
书柜一次比一次空了……

我明白，这是祝先生在预备他的告别。以学术研究为生命的人，书也是他的生命。他要在有可能的时候，给他的书最好的安排，把最看重的宝贝送给需要的人。

祝先生走了。但拿到他书的人，各自得到了他的一部分生命。

岂止是拿到他的书的人。

听过他课的人、读过他书的人、感受到他无私的爱的人，也都得到了他的一部分生命。

查了查记录。

最后一次去祝先生家拿书，是2021年1月11日。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[二十多年前，我刚刚接触计算机时，那时候觉得编程真是一件神奇的事情，居然可以操作屏幕上神奇的字符！要说我自己的第一个编程“作品”，那可能是试图在 286 PC 的黑白显示器绘制一个钢琴键盘，并可以响应按键发出不同频率的蜂鸣声 —— 是的，那时候还没有声卡，只有开机时会“滴”一下的扬声器。虽然这个简陋的尝试并没有完成，但却给了我极大的乐趣，也开启了我的编程生涯。

从《代码大全》 到 StackOverflow 大师

后来，当我在北京找到第一份工作时，学会了 Perl 语言，编写了我的第一个 CGI 程序（互动网页），编程于是成为了我吃饭的本领。

上世纪末，互联网刚刚在国内兴起，人们编程时所能求助的外援，大多是各种语言手册、类库大全等书籍。这其中有一本著名的大部头被很多程序员置于案头，它就是《代码大全》，这本书里面提供了很多有用的、精妙的编程示例和技巧。往往在遇到编程难点时，程序员们可以“复制”书中的一些最佳实践来解决。



随着互联网的普及，逐渐出现了 Stack Overflow 之类的编程类问答网站。程序员们惊喜的发现，原来很多困扰自己的编程难题都可以在网上找到答案，且点赞数较高的代码示例比自己写的还要好。于是乎，很多“程序员”变成了“谷歌程序员”/“百度程序员”，搜索、复制，然后粘贴就好了。以至于，StackOverflow 在某年愚人节的 恶作剧 说，它将限制对其网站的免费访问，除非人们购买“钥匙”：一个带有“打开 Stack Overflow”、“复制”和“粘贴”的按钮的设备，算是对这种直接复制、粘贴的做法表达了一种冷幽默。最有趣的是，居然有热心网友联合键盘定制厂商，真将这块特别的键盘定制出来了，并以 29 美元出售。



程序员们是否越来越成为一种熟练工？

随着写的代码越来越多，这种有趣但有时候又很枯燥的重复工作，让我想过什么时候可以有个…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm a more recent Linux user (about 4 months) and one of the things I'm struggling with is over updating. Essentially every time I sit down my brain goes "oops! Better check for updates! Wouldn't want to be out of date!" And even I can say I'm being excessive. I use Debian/Debian based distros, so those aren't as bleeding edge as others. How often do you need to update to stay safe? Would I be able to go a week? A month? A year, without updating? I know the Arch guys update every other second, but for something less bleeding edge, what would you say would be a proper amount of time before checking for updates, or updating your system?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Over the last five decades or so, free and open-source software (FOSS) has
gone from an almost unknown 
quantity available to only the most technically savvy to underpinning much
of the infrastructure we rely on today.  Much like software itself, FOSS is
"eating the world".  But that has changed—is changing—the role of the
maintainers of all of that code; when "critical" infrastructure uses code
from a FOSS project, suddenly, and perhaps without warning, that code
itself becomes critical.  But many maintainers of that software are
volunteers who did not set out to become beholden to the needs of large
companies and organizations when they released their code, they were just
scratching their itch—now lots of others are clamoring for theirs to be
scratched as well.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello all! Despite my several year usage of Linux and passion for programming, I've not yet delved into the depths of several aspects of Linux itself. I'm working on that now.
 As I come across environment variables, it strikes me that there's so much potential! And it strikes me as interesting that they're not typed whatsoever (useful for quick/dirty scripts, for sure). 
 I've not had much success in searching (although I found GNU's Guile, which looks interesting; maybe not entirely related) but I'm interested to know:
 What is the state of the art in using environment variables for more sophisticated scripts/programming? It seems, for example, that we could create an entire DSL (Domain Specific Language) within such variables that could be changed at runtime -- it seems that having these variables typed would be of interest, it seems that error-checking would be desirable (e.g., if we set an environment variable in a way that depends on an external network call, we want to know if it failed or not) -- again, it seems that there'd be so much potential! 
 I'm certain I'm not the first to think of this, so I'm wondering what experience in these matters exist. Thanks!

It contains 20+ databases, each with installation and data loading scripts. And they can be compared to each other on a set of 43 queries, by data load time or by storage size.
There are switches to select different types of databases for comparison - for example, only MySQL compatible or PostgreSQL compatible.
If you play with the switches, many interesting details will be uncovered.

 TL;DR : Ubuntu hasn't contributed ANYTHING to desktop linux in 8+ years, while red hat and fedora has brought us modern Gnome, Wayland, Fwupd, libinput, Pipewire, and Flatpak.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[微软仍计划默认屏蔽下载的 Office 文件中的宏

多年来，黑客们经常用恶意的宏来攻击 Office 文件。微软原本计划要求 Office 用户在打开从互联网下载的 Office 文件时，通过在文件属性中专门勾选一个解禁选项来启用宏程序。之前计划在 6 月份实施。但微软在 6 月 30 日突然撤销了这一阻止。微软解释称，“根据用户的反馈，我们暂时回退了这一变化，同时我们做了一些额外的改变以提高可用性。”目前，Office 用户可以简单地在文件顶部的横幅上点击一个启用按钮。微软称，“这是一个临时的变化，我们完全致力于为所有用户进行默认的改变。”

老王点评：宏给 Office 带来的好处不如它带来的问题更多，这一举措确实有助于微软提供更好的产品体验。




PyPI 将向关键项目赠送 4000 个安全密钥

PyPI 由 Python 软件基金会（PSF）管理，是 Python 开发人员获得第三方开发的开源包的主要仓库。这些库的安全影响到了整个 Python 生态的安全，PSF 现在强制要求“关键项目”的开发人员在未来几个月内使用双因素认证（2FA），这使得开发人员可以保护自己难于盗取凭证。任何在过去六个月里下载量排名前 1% 的项目将被视作关键项目，有超过 3800 个项目被评为“关键”，这涉及到 8241 个 PyPI 用户。作为 PSF 的赞助商，谷歌开源安全团队提供了 4000 个谷歌泰坦安全密钥，以分发给这些维护者。PyPI 数据显示，目前有 28336 个用户启用了 2FA，其中近 27000 个用户使用的是像“微软验证器”这样的 2FA 应用。


消息来源：ZDNet



老王点评：虽然 2FA 密钥不能完全避免被盗取凭证，但是却可提供大部分保护。




美国企业领导人敦促加强计算机科学教育

超过 500 名美国的商业、教育和非营利组织领导人发表了一封公开信，呼吁美国各州政府和教育负责人为全美的 K-12 学生提供更多的计算机科学教育。他们称，“美国在技术方面领先世界，但我们的高中生中只有 5% 学习计算机科学。这怎么能接受呢？……近三分之二的高技能移民是计算机科学家，每个州都是这种战略人才的进口商。美国有超过 70 万个开放的计算机职位，但每年只有 8 万名计算机科学毕业生。”


消息来源：Geek Wire



老王点评：从这个风向标来看，学计算机还是挺有前景的，当然，我建议你留着国内发展。]]></summary>

Good Pop Bad Pop: An Inventory, by Jarvis Cocker, Jonathan Cape, May 2022, 368pp
贾维斯·科克（Jarvis Cocker）总是被边缘事物所吸引：那些不时髦的、被忽视的、被改变用途的或者过时的东西。他在“果浆”（Pulp）乐队时曾唱过：“奇形怪状、一错再错、格格不入，噢我们看上去和你们不一样。”正如科克在他迷人而杂乱无章的回忆录《好流行坏流行》中对我们讲述的那样，他在很小的时候就被灌输了这种既具有发掘性，又置身事外的美学。他还在读书时就打算要成立一支乐队，名为“果浆”（一开始打算叫它“阿拉比卡式果浆”——“我想这与咖啡有点关系”）。选择这个名字是因为它似乎概括了他的整个计划：“流行（pop）和果浆（pulp）对我来说是可以互换的词汇。”

然而，就科克对其艺术的专注而言，并没有什么是随随便便的。在果浆乐队终于凭借其辉煌而且长盛不衰的专辑《不同阶级》（Different Class，1995年）而大放异彩之前，他们已经用各种方式在边缘摸爬滚打了十五年。他们早期的一次成功是1981年登上约翰·皮尔（John Peel）的BBC广播一套节目，随后又销声匿迹十二年。“在这样的过渡期里我能做什么？”科克语带挖苦地自问。

答案是慢慢地把各种事物整合起来，尝试，失败，然后再来。另外还有，自我放逐。科克复述了一个他以前讲过（包括在“孤岛唱片”里）的故事：1985年，他试图爬进一个女孩的公寓起居室的窗户来打动她。结果很糟糕，他摔断了几根骨头。这是科克的“大马士革之路”时刻：经历不幸通向荣耀。在漫长而沉闷的复健过程中，他意识到了生活其实一直在身边——而这将是他的灵感来源。他开始听巴里·怀特（Barry White）的歌：“音乐上影响我的重要人物之一。” 

《好流行坏流行》在此之后很快就收尾了，而科克在很久以后才成了明星。这本书的目的是记录“启动我创造力的最初尝试”。早在怀特、灵魂乐和Funk音乐之前，科克就尝试过朋克——这对年轻的他来说尤其有吸引力，因为他从未学习过“以传统方式阅读或书写音乐”，总是倾向于将姿势置于技术能力之上。对他来说，这一切都始于审美：慈善商店的衣服、“破烂”的领带、醒目的标志、饱含意图的声明。然后，他要做的就是“开始写几首歌”。

《好流行坏流行》不是一本通常的回忆录，它在结构上好比参观科克的阁楼，看着他筛选生涯中的碎屑。随着回忆的绽放，他也邀请我们玩一个“丢或留”的游戏（书中的“丢弃”用了谢菲尔德俚语“cob”）。他是不是应该保留那些旧演唱会门票、读书时候的照片、内置鼓机的“天才”牌磁带录音机呢？当然啦。那块贴着老式标签的“帝国皮革”牌香皂呢？很遗憾，到了丢掉它的时候了。读者很快就会清楚看到，对废弃物品的喜爱使科克成为一个天生的囤积狂。他也是一个“对变化深恶痛绝”的人，尽管这非常不朋克。

这种旧货铺的淘宝之旅有时会接近于《捕蜂器》（The Wasp Factory）的那种平庸，用科克自己的话来说，是筛找“通灵的苗头”——他热衷于点评社会趋势（“我们生活在一个属于谷歌的时代”）和老头子式的宣言（“性是两个人一起做的事情”）强化了这一印象。科克是一位优秀的词作家，善于运用难忘的场景、愉悦的并列和巧妙的转折；他写的流行歌曲明快悦耳而不落俗套。但作为一个回忆录作者，他并未充分展示自己。我还想进一步了解小摆设背后的那个人。

尽管如此，我们还是能勉力勾勒出简单肖像：一个充满爱心的谢菲尔德人，由一位顽强的单身母亲抚养长大；1980年代依靠派发传单做广告的地下音乐世界；还有科克的音乐历程，从学校里登台的糟糕演出到更好的酒吧献艺，以及他从正规教育中辍学，签约后住到一个棚屋里（正如忧心忡忡的母亲爱唠叨的“从大学预科到垃圾堆”）讨生活。我们读到了其他对他有影响的人，从埃尔维斯·科斯特洛和劳里·安德森，还有斯科特·沃克和马克·E.史密斯。以及一些不可错过的轶事，特别是关于他著名的眼镜。他从小深度近视，当他五岁得到第一副眼镜的时候，世界突然清晰了。“啊，树上原来有那么多洞！”贾维斯·科克心目中的另一位英雄人物莱昂纳德·科恩可能会回嘴：“万物皆有缝隙，不然光怎么照进来。”

（一）

英国初夏的晴日黄昏，最为宜人。前几周的白金禧庆全然落幕，伦敦回到从前。路上行人匆匆，公园里则游客慵懒，或坐或躺，或悠闲漫步，夕阳将长长的身影投到草地上。

从格林地铁站前往佳士得拍卖行在圣詹姆士的总部，五分钟的路程，可以走车水马龙的大路，经过富丽堂皇的丽兹酒店，也可走行人稀少的小路,从公园进入两家花园之间仅够一人通过的窄巷（后来看地图才知道这条小巷居然有名有姓，还是皇家身份，叫Queen’s Psge，可谓是女王胡同），再走过两家低调但极致优雅的传统饭店。佳士得对面的酒吧里客人多多，站满了人行道，拍卖行入口这边也拉起了围绳，排出了一条不短的队伍。每季大拍前的预展和酒会，原本是日常，但6月8日的这个夜场，是两年多来疫情后重启的首次，自然吸引了众多参观者。大家也都一番打扮，女士长裙飘逸，男士穿正装衬衫，见不到牛仔裤和运动鞋。

这场活动的主题，是“文学的艺术”。几年前，佳士得曾有过一场主题为“看东方”的夜场酒会，木版教育信托有幸作为嘉宾参加，拍卖行给了我们一个C位的展场，展览了二十幅“木版画原作集六十家”的版画，信托的理事、版画家何为民在展厅里做了木刻版画工作坊，进行了刻印演示并与观众互动，结束时展场中到处都是穿着时尚小心翼翼捧着自己印制的版画的伦敦美女，一时传为佳话。今年这晚“文学的艺术”，也有诗歌朗诵等许多活动，其中最重要的，是旅英艺术家曲磊磊的书法工作坊。大展室的四壁上挂着磊磊老师的书画作品，两张长长的桌子上铺开了大幅宣纸，摆好了数套笔墨。英国北京艺术团国画班的几十位学员前去参加活动，有趣的是，课程一直在线上进行，这也是许多学生第一次得见磊磊老师真容。曲磊磊挥毫演示、耐心讲解，中外弟子和其他参观者也在巨幅宣纸长卷上各显神通，可谓这个艺术之夜的高潮。

无论你有多少存储空间，了解文件占用了多少磁盘空间都是一个重要的考虑事项。我的笔记本有一个相对较小的 250GB NVME 驱动器，大多数时候都没什么问题，但几年前我开始探索 Linux 上的游戏，情况变得有所不同，安装 Steam 和其他游戏使存储管理更加重要。

du 命令

检查磁盘驱动器上剩余存储空间最简单的方法是 du 命令。它会估计文件空间使用情况，像其他所有 Linux 工具一样，du 非常强大，但学会如何根据你的特定需求使用它会很有帮助。我总是查阅手册页来掌握实用程序的用法。du 有几个选项，可以为你提供文件存储的最佳快照，以及它们在系统上消耗多少空间。

du 命令有很多选项，以下是一些常见的：


-a - 包括文件夹和文件在内的存储信息

--apparent-size - 打印自身大小而不是占用磁盘量

-h - 人类可读的格式

-b - 以字节为单位

-c - 总计

-k - 以块为单位

-m - 以兆字节为单位的大小


务必查看 du 手册页获取完整帮助列表。

显示所有文件

你可以选择的第一个选项是 du -a，它可以显示系统上所有文件及其存储目录的大小。这个命令让我知道了我的主目录中存储了 11555168 个字节。使用 du -a 可以快速递归地查看我的存储系统。如果我想要一个更有意义的数字，并且我想深入到目录中查看大文件的位置，该怎么办？

我认为在 Downloads 目录下有一些大文件，所以我输入 du -a /home/don/Downloads 来查看。

$ du -a ~/Downloads

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Internxt 发布了一个新产品，它可以让你快速地将加密文件发送给任何人，同时保持你的隐私。嗯，我们只能希望它不会像 Firefox Send 那样关闭吧……




Internxt 是一个相当新的开源加密云服务，旨在取代大型科技公司的产品。例如，你可以把它作为谷歌的相册和云端硬盘的替代品。

它免费提供 10 GB 的容量。所以，如果感兴趣的话，你可以注册个账号试一试。

最近，他们还新增了另一个产品 “Internxt Send”，作为 Firefox Send 的替代品，填补这个空缺。

唉，说到这里还挺遗憾的，Firefox Send 已停止服务了，不得不说它是一个很好的工具！

不过，Internxt Send 让你可以像 Firefox Send 一样安全地发送/共享图像、视频、文档和其他文件。

Internxt Send：一个安全的文件共享服务



我在 GitHub 上找不到 Internxt Send 的存储库，但我已经要求他们澄清了。

（LCTT 译注：虽然 Internxt 是在 GitHub 上开源的，但是 GitHub 上没有 Internxt Send 这个产品的存储库，产品的介绍里也没有声称它是开源的。）

正如你所期望的那样，你无需创建帐户即可将文件上传到 Internxt Send。

文件上传限制为 5 GB。而且，你不能以任何方式提高这个限制。

你可以选择文件，上传并生成共享链接。或者，你也可以直接向收件人发送电子邮件，那样的话，你需要在邮件里分享你的电子邮件地址。



有趣的是，它还允许你在这个电子邮件中添加自定义文本。

与 Firefox Send 不同的是，你无法修改文件共享链接的到期时间，或者是让它在多次下载后失效。默认情况下，链接会在 15 天后过期，你无法更改这个时间。嗯，这还挺扫兴的。

但是，对于那些正在苦苦等待一个加密的共享文件服务的人来说，这可能是一种替代方案。

我认为有更多的 Firefox Send 替代品是件好事！你对 Internxt Send 有何看法？欢迎在下方评论区里和大家分享。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I spent a year avoiding Ubuntu whilst dual booting because it got like a quarter of the battery life as Windows. I had to go around hunting to find out about this TLP thing, and it works like a miracle you install it and you start it and you get a dramatic increase in battery life without any noticeable impact in functionality. It's pretty amazing but
 why is this not built in?
 I just recently clean installed Ubuntu 22.04, and I noticed they added some power management to the settings. I think to myself "it's about gosh darn time" then just today I'm sitting there not even watching videos I'm just browsing the web and after an hour, half of my battery is gone.
 I do a little research and it turns out the power management they included is rubbish. All it really does is CPU throttling. I remove it and install TLP and the battery reports going from 8 watts at idle down to 6 Watts.
 The battery life on Ubuntu out of the box on a laptop is so bad it's going to turn people away why would they not include TLP by default when being installed bare metal on a laptop?
 (I haven't really tried any other distributions on battery so I can't speak to anything other than Ubuntu but I read Fedora has a similar issue)

I've been offered a position at Microsoft to do kernel development work. This would be a big transition to me, coming from a services background (backend only).

I really liked being a C programmer and I've kept an eye on things over the years, and did some hobby projects (on x86 and some embedded stuff as well).
There's a lot about my current job that I treasure, despite the work itself not being interesting to me about 99% of the time. It's a remote job, the work-life balance is stellar, and I get 25 days of vacation a year (this is in the US), which allows me to spend a lot o…]]></summary>

mailing list that started as a query about adding support for custom

frequently used for handling units and unit conversion in C++, so the
Python discussion fairly quickly focused on that use case.  While ideas about a
possible feature were batted about, it does not seem like anything that is
being pursued in earnest, at least at this point.  But some of the facets
of the problem are, perhaps surprisingly, more complex than might be guessed.]]></summary>

new set of speculative-execution vulnerabilities known as "Retbleed".  In
short, the retpoline defenses added when Spectre was initially disclosed
turn out to be insufficient on x86 machines because return instructions,
too, can be speculatively executed.

	kernel required a substantial effort, involving changes to 68
	files, 1783 new lines and 387 removed lines. Our performance
	evaluation shows that mitigating Retbleed has unfortunately turned
	out to be expensive: we have measured between 14% and 39% overhead

Those mitigations were pulled into the mainline
kernel today.  They are 
not in the July 12 stable kernel
updates but will almost certainly show up in those channels soon.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[WebAssembly is a modern bytecode supported by all browsers and designed to be a compiler target for a wide variety of programming languages.
To effectively support some forms of Functional Programming support for tail-calls has been proposed as an extension to the WebAssembly standard.
This proposal has reached Phase3 of the standardization process years ago, but has since stalled.
Phase3 is known as "the implementation phase" and the prerequisite for advancing the proposal to Phase4 is to have support in two different browser engines. V8/Chrome support has been available for a long time, so another engine is required.
To unblock this situation we have contributed full support for WebAssembly Tail Calls to JavaScript/WebKit/Safari. The PR is available here:
https://github.com/WebKit/WebKit/pull/2065
An in-depth article about the challenges of implementing this feature is also available. This is intended both as documentation for our contribution, but also as a general explainer about how tails calls actually work, with a particular focus on stack space management.

日本 NHK 宣布在其视频平台 NHK+ 上将不支持 Firefox，而推荐用户使用 Chrome、Edge 或 Safari 的最新版本。苹果的商业网站 business.apple.com 也把 Firefox 排除在支持范围之外，使用任何版本的 Firefox 打开该网站就会显示“你的浏览器不受支持”，它也推荐用户使用 Firefox 外的浏览器。

老王点评：虽然 Firefox 的标准遵从性还不错，但是随着 Chrome 的市场占据了大部分份额，网站也会越来越依赖 Chrome 独有的一些特性。Firefox 的日子会越来越难过。




科学家找到了一类量子算法可以解决的新问题

1994 年数学家 Peter Shor 想出了如何让量子计算机完成普通经典计算机无法做到的事情。原则上，一台基于量子规则的机器可有效地将大数分解为质因数，这对于经典计算机来说，这是一项非常困难的任务。但三十年来，科学家们仅在一个被称为 NP 的标准集中发现了一个单一的、狭窄的问题类别可以显著加速。今年四月，科学家们又发现了一类量子计算可以以指数级速度解决的问题：它涉及仅根据混乱的输出来计算复杂数学过程的输入。


消息来源：Solidot



老王点评：目前看起来量子计算还只能用在很狭窄的领域，什么时候可以进行通用计算，或许带来的是颠覆性的变化，对这一天，我是又期盼，又恐惧。




过去十年的本田车型都可能受到网络攻击

安全研究人员发布了他们使用手持无线电解锁和远程启动几辆本田汽车的视频，他们称，这是因为 2012 年至今 10 年间生产的许多本田汽车的无钥匙进入系统存在漏洞。这种攻击使用无线电设备记录来自钥匙扣的合法无线电信号，然后将其传送到汽车上。这被称为重放攻击。理论上，每个信号应该只起一次作用；当按下按钮解锁汽车时，车就会解锁并且这个信号不应该再次用于解锁。但安全研究人员发现，这种攻击之所以奏效是因为它能够重新同步汽车的计数器，使之可以接受旧的代码。但本田否认了这一漏洞。

老王点评：目前看起来汽车的电子钥匙其实挺危险的。]]></summary>

　　根据法庭文件，推特指控马斯克违反收购合同这一行为是“虚伪和恶意的”，并要求他以440亿美元的价格收购这家社交媒体公司。
　　法庭文件显示，“2022年4月，埃隆·马斯克与推特签订了协议，承诺将尽最大努力完成交易。现在，不到三个月后，马斯克拒绝履行对推特及其股东的义务，因为他签署的交易不再符合他的个人利益。”
　　在推特提起诉讼后不久，马斯克在推特上发文称，“哦，真讽刺，哈哈哈。”
　　据此前报道，当地时间8日，马斯克表示因为推特严重违反了收购协议中的多项条款，所以将终止对推特的收购。据悉，根据该协议条款，如果马斯克退出收购，需要支付推特10亿美元。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ubuntu 22.04 LTS 是迄今为止最好的 Ubuntu 版本之一。是什么让它如此安全？




早在今年 4 月就发布了的 Ubuntu 22.04 LTS，是迄今为止最安全的 Ubuntu 版本。

其安全更新的延长支持、新的硬件支持和其他林林总总的改进，使它在安全方面远远超过了之前的所有版本。

但它是如何做到这一点的呢？还有，是什么让这个版本与以前的版本不同的呢？

嗯，有几个原因，Canonical 在一篇新的博客文章中为我们重点指出了这些。在这里，让我总结一下，以帮助你了解更多。

是什么让 Ubuntu 22.04 LTS 变得安全？

在这个版本中，Ubuntu 团队似乎投入了大量的工作来确保其长期的安全性和可靠性。尽管多年来他们以难以想象的方式做到了这一点，但我将强调其中的几件事：


改进的硬件安全措施支持

更新了安全包

私有家目录

OpenSSL 3

GCC 11

nftables 作为默认的防火墙后端

Linux 内核改进


1、改进的硬件安全措施支持



随着英特尔、AMD 和 ARM 的 CPU/SoC 开始推出更多的安全措施，拥有足够的软件来让这些功能发挥作用就变得越来越重要。

截至目前，Ubuntu 22.04 支持三种主要的硬件安全措施。

英特尔的 “软件保护扩展Software Guard eXtensions”（SGX）提供了一个安全独立的区域来进行敏感计算。例如，理想情况下，密码处理将在这里进行，因为它确保没有其他应用程序可以访问这些数据。

还有 AMD 的“安全加密虚拟化Secure Encrypted Virtualization”（SEV）。这项技术旨在防止主机操作系统干扰正在运行的虚拟机。

尽管这与桌面用户的相关性不如其他技术，但要知道，很多数据中…]]></summary>

 Zorin Menu and Zorin Taskbar were 100% original extensions developed by Artyom for the ZorinOS and Dash to Panel and Arc Menu are forks of these 2 extensions developed by Zorin. Later Arc Menu and Dash to Panel got a lot more popular and a cyclic contribution started between Arc Menu and Zorin Menu.
 To learn that Gnome wouldn't have had a taskbar or start menu if not for ZorinOS is kinda mind blowing.

使用 C 编写的应用程序时，通常有多个源码文件，但最终你需要编译成单个的可执行文件。

你可以通过两种方式来完成这项工作：通过创建一个 静态static 库 或 一个 动态dynamic 库（也被称为 共享shared 库）。从创建和链接的方式来看，它们是两种不同类型的库。选择使用哪种方式取决于你的的具体场景。

在 上一篇文章 中，我演示了如何创建一个动态链接的可执行文件，这是一种更通用的方法。在这篇文章中，我将说明如何创建一个静态链接的可执行文件。

使用静态库链接器

链接器linker是一个命令，它将一个程序的多个部分结合在一起，并为它们重新组织内存分配。

链接器的功能包括：


整合一个程序的所有的部分

计算出一个新的内存组织结构，以便所有的部分组合在一起

恢复内存地址，以便程序可以在新的内存组织结构下运行

解析符号引用


链接器通过这些功能，创建了一个名称为可执行文件的一个可运行程序。

静态库是通过复制一个程序中的所有依赖库模块到最终的可执行镜像来创建的。链接器将链接静态库作为编译过程的最后一步。可执行文件是通过解析外部引用、将库例程与程序代码结合在一起来创建的。

创建目标文件

这里是一个静态库的示例以及其链接过程。首先，创建带有这些函数识别标志的头文件 mymath.h :

int add(int a, int b);
int sub(int a, int b);
int mult(int a, int b);
int divi(int a, int b);


使用这些函数定义来创建 add.c 、sub.c 、mult.c 和 divi.c 文件。我将把所有的代码都放置到一个代码块中，请将其分为四个文件，如注释所示：…]]></summary>

《创造现代世界：英国启蒙运动钩沉》，[英]罗伊·波特著，李源、张恒杰、李上、刘北成译，商务印书馆2022年2月出版，810页，228.00元
由于教学与研究的需要，我经常会将罗伊·波特的Enlightenment: Britain and the Creation of the Modern World（The Penguin Press，2000年）拿出来阅读参考，在上海疫情期间，得知此书已被刘北成教授主持翻译为中文出版，书名为《创造现代世界：英国启蒙运动钩沉》，欣喜之余，深感此书值得一读。

此书作者罗伊·波特受业于剑桥大学，曾经跟随“剑桥学派”代表性人物昆廷·斯金纳研习思想史，后转向医学社会史研究，其学术成果显著，声誉隆盛，以至于现在学界很多人常常认为他是医学社会史研究领域的权威。其实，在很长一段时间里，他仍然耕耘在思想史领域，特别是十八世纪启蒙运动史。据我所知，在这本Enlightenment: Britain and the Creation of the Modern World之后，他又出版了《启蒙运动》（2001年，北京大学出版社于2018年出版中文版）和Flesh in the Age of Reason: How the Enlightenment Transformed the Way We See Our Bodies and Souls（Penguin Press，2004年）等。
罗伊·波特
从学术维度上看，启蒙运动是一个学术积累丰厚，但也富有争议的领域。自上个世纪八十年代以来，学者日益拓展了启蒙运动的研究领域：一是打破了过去以法国启蒙运动为中心的旧有范式，将启蒙运动看作为复数，重新发现了启蒙运动在各个国家展开的不同样式，如苏格兰启蒙运动，意大利启蒙运动等。二为注重…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[谷歌编程之夏（GSoC）是一个谷歌举办的国际年度项目，每年都在夏季举办。当贡献者们参与并完成一个 自由开源软件 的编码项目，谷歌 就会给他们发放 津贴。谷歌编程之夏于 2005 年推出，于每年 5 月至 8 月举行。项目创意由参与开源软件开发的主办组织提交，但学生也可以提出自己的项目创意。

今年，该项目向 18 岁或以上的任何人开放 —— 不仅限于学生和应届毕业生了。参与者通过编写软件获得报酬，其 津贴 的金额取决于他们所在国家/地区的 购买力平价。

LCTT 译注：以往，这个活动只允许在校学生参与，今年条件放开，只需年龄 18+ 即可，对参与者的贡献时长要求也降低了，尽可能地让更多人参与进来。不过，今年的报名通道在 4 月 19 日就截止了，大家有兴趣的话明年可以关注一下。

这也是 Zephyr 项目第一次作为 Linux 基金会的项目，参与到谷歌编程之夏中。让我们一起欢迎这些贡献者及其项目吧！

项目一：基于 Zephyr 的 Arduino 模块

1 个贡献者（350 小时）。

Arduino 是一个流行的框架，它为嵌入式设备编程提供了一个简化的接口。最近，Arduino 采用 mbed OS 作为其一些新设备的基础 RTOS。通过这项工作，他们将 Arduino Core 作为独立的抽象层，从 Arduino Core for mbed 中分离出来。这为在其他操作系统上利用 Arduino Core 开辟了可能性。

该项目的想法就是创建一个利用 Arduino Core 的 Zephyr 模块，以便开发人员在与 Arduino 兼容的设备上使用 Arduino 框架时，可以使用 Zephyr 作为底层操作系统。对用户的好处包括：


可以访问 Arduino API 以及高级 Zephyr 功能

得益于 Zephyrs 的设备支持，…]]></summary>

 My grandfather was a computer wiz. He coded for the military, Atari and IBM back in the day, his preferred work machine was Redhat before he died. My main machine runs mint(no particular reason, just the first one I installed in highschool and what I tend to go back to after distri hopping). Before he died, he recommended I try CentOS since its “more or less free Redhat”. I never thought about it too much, but I’ve been thinking about him and wanted to give Cent a shot. I of course did some googling but I was curious what the community thought about Cent and Redhat.

 installed ubuntu mate on it so it runs faster 
 only problem, linux works a little differently than windows: it doesn’t “get what you mean” ie you have to figure out how to tell it exactly what you want 
 nothing works the way u expect etc. however, there are lots of linux forums full of how to fix the same problem you’re having 
 In general I think installing linux on a slow PC instead of buying a new PC is a horrible idea if you’re not a tech person. you’re definitely better off troubleshooting windows than ubuntu mate imo 
 do not be like me and install faster linux os without creating windows 11 recovery drive first

马斯克曾多次公开表示，他希望知道有多少推特账户是由机器人运营的，因为他觉得可疑账户的数量影响了公司的价值。因此他寻求检测和处理虚假账户的方法。当推特最终提供了马斯克明确要求的 8 个开发者 API 的访问权时，这些 API 的速率限制低于推特向其最大企业客户提供的速率限制。马斯克称，这使得他们无法在任何合理的时间内完成数据分析。

许多老的 X.Org 组件在本周末有新的发布

上周末，Oracle 的长期 X.Org 贡献者 Alan Coopersmith 对各种旧的、很少维护的 X.Org 项目发布了许多新的更新。这些软件多年来没有任何更新，新的版本大多只是收集了过去几年中的一些随机修复。总的来说，这些更新并没有什么值得兴奋的改进。


消息来源：Phoronix



老王点评：这是觉得 X.org 快被放弃了才最后抢救一次？从另外一方面看，可见 X.org 社区有多冷清了。连随手收到的一些修复都懒得发布个新版本。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[On his blog, Armin Ronacher comments about a recent security key giveaway by the Python Package Index (PyPI) to provide two-factor authentication (2FA) tokens to the maintainers of the "critical" projects on the index.  While (eventually) requiring maintainers to use 2FA before being able to update PyPI packages is reasonable, Ronacher worries about where the idea might lead:


Instead of putting the burden to the user of packages, we're now piling stuff onto the developer who already puts their own labor and time into it. From the index' point of view there is a benefit to not enforce rules on everybody as some of these rules might make the use of the index burdensome, but putting the burden only on critical packages does not hurt the adoption just as much. As mentioned earlier I would not make the case that 2FA is not burdensome, it's a sensible thing. But clearly the index considers it burdensome enough to not enforce it for everybody. More importantly though is what could come next.

There is a hypothetical future where the rules tighten. One could imagine that an index would like to enforce cryptographic signing of newly released packages. Or the index wants to enable reclaiming of critical packages if the author does not respond or do bad things with the package. For instance a critical package being unpublished is a problem for the ecosystem. One could imagine a situation where in that case the Index maintainers take over the record of that package on the index to undo the damage. Likewise it's more than imaginable that an index of the future will require packages to enforce a minimum standard for critical packages such as a certain SLO for responding to critical incoming requests (security, trademark laws etc.).]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[据第一财经，近日，有网友在社交平台称，此前与支付宝合作的盛京银行目前无法提现。盛京银行回应称，已停止通过支付宝平台销售存款产品。
　　对此，第一财经记者致电盛京银行，盛京银行回复称：“根据监管9号文要求，我行已停止通过支付宝平台销售存款产品，仅保留通过支付宝平台为存量客户提供余额查询、购买明细查询、提前支取等服务；按照支付宝平台规则，相关服务操作时间为北京时间每日07:00-23:00。”
　　2021年1月15日，银保监会、央行发布《关于规范商业银行通过互联网开展个人存款业务有关事项的通知》（银保监办发[2021]9号，下称《通知》），明确指出商业银行不得通过非自营网络平台开展定期存款和定活两便存款业务，包括但不限于由非自营网络平台提供营销宣传、产品展示、信息传输、购买入口、利息补贴等服务。
　　由此，第三方平台开始下架存款产品。
　　2021年，沈阳国资两次增持盛京银行股份，成为盛京银行第一大股东。
　　官网资料显示，盛京银行总部位于辽宁省沈阳市，前身是沈阳市商业银行，2007年2月经中国银监会批准更名为盛京银行，是东北地区实力雄厚的总部银行。2014年12月29日，该行在香港联合交易所主板成功上市。
　　从经营情况来看，2021年，盛京银行实现营收154.67亿元，同比下降4.9%；实现净利润4.31亿元，同比下降65%。截至2021年末，该行资产总额为10061.26亿元，较上年末减少3.1%。
　　资产质量方面，拨备覆盖率130.87%，较上年末提高16.82个百分点。资本充足率方面，截至去年末该行核心一级资本充足率和一级资本充足率均为10.54%，资本充足率为12.12%，满足监管要求。
　　值得关注的是，2021年9月29日，沈阳盛京金控投资集团有限公司曾受让恒大集团（南昌）有限公司所持有的盛京银行19.93%股份，成为盛京银行第一大股东。

Their email is not responding, their website no longer can be found, and any GitHub commits are basically pretty simple things. Apparently the reason is not enough funding.
 Under that post, I saw someone saying about reviving it again, and replied saying that if there are a few of us looking to do so I was ready to help. Long story short, about 10 people wanted to help me, so I've decided to overtake their distribution and recreate it from scratch using their desktop, apps etc.
 And this is where the first questions start:
  
1. What would you like to see from a distro like CutefishOS? Any recommendations, improvements? Don't be afraid to ask for some major changes.
 2. CutefishOS was using both Ubuntu and Debian as it's own base. I've also thought of Arch but I'm worried about stability and user friendliness, but it's not gone yet as an idea. Which one do you think would suit you better out of these three?
 3. Any particular things you don't like about CutefishOS? (Literally anything).
 4. Since this isn't really CutefishOS but rather a fork of it, I'd like to hear some name suggestions. Preferably not mentioning any other distro than CutefishOS.
  
I might create a GitHub repo to discuss everything there as devs, as soon as I'm sure there are people interested in the project.

Sybil，or the Two Nations, by Benjamin Disraeli, Wildside Press, March 2004, 412pp
1845年，英国小说家本杰明·迪斯雷利（1804-1881）“青年英格兰”三部曲的第二部《西比尔：或两个国度》（Sybil, or the Two Nations）问世，风靡一时。小说描绘了十九世纪中期英格兰社会的真实状况，被誉为维多利亚时代最负盛名的“政治小说”之一。巧合的是，恩格斯在同年出版的《英国工人阶级状况》一书中也认为随着贫富差距加大，英国事实上已分裂为“两个国度”——“工人比起资产阶级来，说的是另一种习惯语，有另一套思想和观念，另一套习俗和道德原则，另一种宗教和政治。这是两种完全不同的人，他们彼此是这样地不同，就好像他们是属于不同的种族一样”。恩格斯本人显然注意到了他和迪斯雷利的相似之处——他在1892年德文版中加入一则注解：“大家知道，狄思累利在他的长篇小说《神巫，或两种民族》中，几乎和我同时说出了大工业把英国人分为两种不同的民族的见解。”

维多利亚女王治下的大英帝国外表光鲜，有太平盛世之美誉。事实上，早在迪斯雷利开始小说创作之前，英国就享有“世界工厂”的称号：它的工业生产总值约占全球三分之一，钢铁和煤炭产量占世界半数；此外，英国商船纵横全球，繁盛的殖民地“贸易”将世界各地财富源源不断运回母国，伦敦由此也成为世界唯一的金融中心；它的国土面积超过三千三百万平方公里，是当之无愧的“日不落帝国”。毫无疑问，英国率先发动的工业革命为本国经济注入了巨大活力，从根本上改变了人们的生活方式，但与此同时，这一场变革也深刻改变了英国的社会结构：资本主义的生产方式扩大了贫富差距，使得英国社会最终沦为贫富之间存在不可逾越鸿沟的“两个…]]></summary>

《缘起香港：张爱玲的异乡和世界》，黄心村著，香港中文大学出版社，2022年7月出版，448页，28.00美元
张爱玲的故事说不完，不但她自己不断地叙述、重复和改写，而且崇拜她的“张迷”和研究“张学”的学者的著作更是越来越多，目不暇给。在我看过的众多张学著作中，黄心村的这本新作独树一格，令我眼睛一亮，从第一页开始读就放不下。虽然内中有两三章的前身在港台的刊物上发表过，如今重读依然引人入胜。另外几篇是第一次读，更令我惊喜。我不算是张迷，然而为什么黄心村的这本书竟然让我如此着迷？写这篇文章，却不知如何写起，只能把自己的一点阅读心得如实招来，和我自己对这位祖师奶奶的看法连在一起，作意识流式的叙述，随意发挥，断断续续，不成章法，尚望作者和读者原谅。 

一

本书作者黄心村是香港大学比较文学系的教授，也是一位成就卓越的中国现代文学学者，她研究张爱玲，可谓理所当然。书中前几章的珍贵资料，都是她在港大挖掘出来的，为了纪念张爱玲诞生一百周年展览之用，无心插柳，却硕果丰富。众所周知，张爱玲于1939至1941年间在港大读过书，在英国殖民主义的文化环境中接受教育并汲取文学创作的灵感，因此香港也是她创作灵感的源泉和起点。至今港大的图书馆还收藏了不少张爱玲的资料，为什么研究张爱玲和港大的关系的专著不多？张爱玲和香港的因缘就是由港大而起，她在港大虽然没有毕业，但是她的西方文学和历史的训练却是从港大开始的。本书的前三章都直接或间接与港大有关，讨论张爱玲在港大的生活和学习经验；后五章则把时空的幅度扩展到校园之外，讨论张爱玲一生和香港的缘分，为我们重绘了香港的文化图景。 
黄心村考据出张爱玲从前居住的港大女生宿舍，这是在成为女生宿舍之前的建筑样貌。摄于1930年代。亚历克·库珀（Alec Coope…]]></summary>

吉列尔莫·马丁内斯
吉列尔莫·马丁内斯是博尔赫斯之后第二个在《纽约客》上发表短篇小说的阿根廷人，这是书商对他的介绍。隐含的意思是，按照美国文学的某种标准，他和博尔赫斯一样值得注意。可是博尔赫斯之后有那么多非常好的阿根廷作家，比如科塔萨尔，就没有获得这种奥斯卡最佳外语片一样的殊荣。在今天的世界，马丁内斯是书写“知识”和因果性最具有娱乐性和最深刻的作家之一，但这句话就很难放在腰封上。

马丁内斯最好的作品《牛津迷案》受惠于博尔赫斯的一个短篇。作为小说家，受到博尔赫斯的影响不是什么令人羞耻的事情。正好相反，最好的学生都把博尔赫斯的名字写在小说里，翁贝托·艾柯《玫瑰之名》里的盲眼修士叫布尔戈索的豪尔赫，他还是图书馆长，这个名字一出现，有经验的读者就应该知道他绝对不是路人。《玫瑰之名》参考的除了《死亡与指南针》，还有《通天塔图书馆》。艾柯在为自己辩解的时候说，有些东西当然属于博尔赫斯，但是博尔赫斯也继承了别人，为什么你们不认为我有可能是继承了更早的、更本质的东西呢？他知道这样一来，这种学习行为即使在特别势利的读者眼里，也完全可以变得正当了。他还说，我这本书还学习了托马斯·曼的《浮士德博士》，为什么你们都看不出来呢。

除了作家，马丁内斯还有一重身份：布宜诺斯艾利斯大学的教授。这是一所很好的大学。通常没几个教授能写出被人记住的小说。有人先写出几本好书，再被随便哪个学校评为名誉教授，但这是犯规路径。戴维·洛奇曾经在伦敦大学教课，他有一些有趣的作品，是写他的文科同行。在《小世界》里，结构主义还是一种时髦到神秘的学问，而现在早已没有人愿意谈它了，读起来恍若隔世。库切是文学教授的骄傲，《耻》写的是教授的生活，并且他也得了诺贝尔奖。但是数学教授，他们在文学世界里像是不存在的生物，除了马丁内斯。他生于1962年，还没有退休。

一、楔子

再一次，我要对那些因为被标题误导而点击进来的读者说声抱歉：本文与小说无关，更与加西亚·马尔克斯无关。与之相关的是三年前在《上海书评》上发表的《教宗子午线谜案》，本文是该篇的补充。

有朋友在读完《教宗子午线谜案》后反馈说：我提出了很多问题，却没有解决问题。确实，当初写作的目的只是尝试指出现有的经济学制度分析方法之不足，至于是否可能存在更为合适的制度解释理路，文中只是给出了些许线索，并未做详细的探讨。

现在，我想通过分析其中一个典型案例——葡萄牙、西班牙与奥斯曼帝国在十六世纪的争霸与衰败，将《教宗子午线谜案》一文中提出的论题再往前推进一步，做一点衍生性思考。当然，这样的思考依旧不能解决现有理论存在的缺陷，甚至不可能让许多人（部分包括我自己在内）感到满意。但是至少我认为，对理解长时间段、大范围的社会制度变迁而言，探索一种相较于现有的经济学制度分析理论更为契合的解释框架，是可行的。

在开始之前，有必要指出：

第一，本文作为补篇，自然需要和前文保持一致，树立一个可供商榷的“靶子”。作为本文参照性评论的著作，我选取的是阿西莫格鲁（Daron Acemoglu）和罗宾逊（James A. Robinson）的《狭径》（The Narrow Corridor, 2019）。恰好，该书也是《教宗子午线谜案》一文中曾经评论过的《国家为什么会失败》（Why Nations Fail, 2012）一书的后续。

第二，作为一篇随笔性质的短文，论述当然无法达到学术论文那般的专业和严谨。本文所能做到的，是尽可能将观点及其论证过程用通俗的方式阐释清楚，但其中涉及的大量细节性材料和具体的理论，仍然不得不有所取舍。对那些追求完美的读者来说，参考与之相关的专业论文，查证一手资料和数据，是极其有必要的。

第三，无…]]></summary>

当我尝试从 Snap 文件安装应用程序时：

sudo snap install snap_file


它给了我以下错误：

error: cannot find signatures with metadata for snap "masscode_2.6.1_amd64.snap"




这很奇怪。在 Ubuntu 中添加外部仓库 时，你必须添加 GPG 密钥。但是这里的开发人员没有提供这样的东西。

“修复”简单易行。让我给你解释一下。

处理 “cannot find signatures with metadata for snap” 错误

这里其实不涉及签名。

发生的情况是你从第三方下载了 Snap 安装程序。 Ubuntu 中的 Snap 机制希望你从官方 Snap 商店获取 Snap 包。

由于它不是来自 Snap 商店，因此你会看到 “cannot find signatures with metadata for snap” 的错误消息。与大多数错误消息一样，这个错误消息不是描述性的。

那么，这里的解决方案是什么？

任何未通过 Snap 商店分发的 Snap 包都必须使用 --dangerous 选项进行安装。这就是规则。

sudo snap install --dangerous path_to_snap_file


这样，你告诉 Snap 包管理器显式安装 Snap 包。

在这里，我使用了这个选项并且能够成功地从它的 Snap 包中安装 massCode。



以这种方式安装 Snap 包有多“危险”？几乎和下载并 安装 deb 格式安装包 相同。

在我看来，如果你是从项目开发者的网站上下载 Snap 包，你已经在信任该项目了。在这种情况下，你可以使用 --dangerous 选项安装它。

当然，你应该首先搜索该软件包是否在 Snap 商店中可用：

snap find package_name


我希望这个快速的小技巧可以帮助你修复 Snap 错误。如果你有任何问题或建议，请告诉我。如果你想了解更多信息，请参阅 这个使用 Snap 命令指南。

Here the cursor takes no heed of what you're typing and just advances at a steady pace, with the effect that typing something reasonable-looking requires you to type at a very steady rhythm. There's also the bonus that the space character is no longer needed—you can (and kind of have to) just wait—so the keyboard minimalists among us can shave even more space off their devices. Only desktop for now.
It's an interesting contrast to the last one I made—which requires you to do all the heavy lifting in moving the cursor position yourself—https://oisinmoran.com/typewriter

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Assuming newcomers will face difficulties no matter what (having to adapt to new alternative programs, having maybe some hardware issues, etc) I think it's a bad idea to present them a UI that is kinda-like-what-they're-used-to-but-not-really and only make things more confusing.
 Having something more carefully designed and intuitive (like gnome 40+, imo) is more beneficial. It's a hurdle to learn something from scratch but at least they have a way to mentally separate the UI from windows.
 Also I remember back in the days of being a teen a using ubuntu (gnome 2) and liking it specifically because it was different and with the cool transitions, effects, and so on.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[俄罗斯的 Debian 衍生发行版的开发商计划上市

来自俄罗斯的 Astra Linux 是 Debian 的下游发行版，它已经存在了一些年，除了 x86、Arm 等 CPU 架构外，它还支持 MIPS 架构。它是由 RusBITech 开发的，是专门为俄罗斯军队设计的。微软已经阻止了 Windows 在俄罗斯的使用，这似乎大大有助于推动替代操作系统的采用。路透社报道说，RosBITech 正计划在莫斯科证券交易所上市，估值约折合为 2.6 亿美元。


消息来源：The Register



老王点评：我觉得他们比较谦虚，要是搞个根社区可能估值更高呢。




KDE Plasma 5.26 有望使用 C++20 进行开发

在即将到来的 KDE Plasma 5.26 桌面环境中，KDE 开发者正考虑使用 C++20 语言开发后续功能，尤其是使用 C++ 协同例程支持特性。随着时间的推移，这种较新的 C++ 语言也会用于其他 KDE 组件。将 C++ 要求提升到 C++20 意味着将 KDE 编译器要求提高到 GCC 10 或 Clang 11，而这些版本的编译器已经稳定发布两年了。


消息来源：Phoronix



老王点评：看来最近各个开源项目都在逐渐迁移到新的语言标准和新的编译器了，这种稳健而进步的态度是开源的生命力。




RISC-V 仅用 12 年达成百亿核心里程碑

在近日召开的 Embedded World 大会上，RISC-V 国际的 CEO 宣布目前 RISC-V 市场上的核心数量已经突破 100 亿。CEO 认为开放标准是关键，“Linux 在为软件所做的事情，和我们为硬件所做的事情有异曲同工之妙。”RISC-V 是一种开放标准指令集架构（ISA），根据开源许可提供。据悉，ARM 架构经过 17 年，在 2008 年实现了这个里程碑。而 RISC-V 只用了 12 年就完成了这一目标。


消息来源：WCCF Tech



老王点评：看来 RISC-V 真能复制 Linux 在软件方面的成功啊。]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[近日，北京市邮政管理局近日依法对北京京讯递科技有限公司（京东快递北京总部）违法违规行为进行行政处罚。


　　在对门头沟区京东金春时代营业部检查中发现，某快递员未佩戴N95口罩，核酸检测未落实一天一检。调查中，该营业部称该快递员未核酸检测时均未在岗工作，并以监控设备临时损坏为由拒绝调阅视频。属地管理部门西区邮政管理局在调查核实中确认该员工一直在一线岗位工作，并未落实一日一检防疫要求。该营业部同时存在部分员工未佩戴N95口罩上岗作业、部分时段未进行快件消杀等问题。属地管理部门西区邮政管理局下发了责令改正通知书，对企业有关负责人进行了行政约谈，并对违法违规问题进行处罚。


　　市邮政管理局就京东快递北京总部疫情防控主体责任落实不到位、疫情防控措施执行不严格进行约谈，要求该公司逐级压实企业网点疫情防控责任，严格落实常态化疫情防控措施，切实加强人员防疫安全教育和规范管理，严格落实从业人员每日核酸检测，严格落实从业人员疫苗接种要求，严格落实扫码测温查验，落实企业防疫专员制度，深入自查整改疫情防控隐患。


　　北京市邮政管理局表示，当前，北京已转入常态化疫情防控，邮政快递企业人员作为重点行业从业人员务必坚持疫情防控不放松，严格落实核酸检测等各项疫情防控措施。此次京东快递门头沟区金春时代营业部暴露出的突出问题为行业疫情防控工作带来隐患，北京市邮政管理局将持续加大执法检查力度，从严从紧查处违法违规行为。

 I have been using nvidia-open for a while, and I am really surprised how well it works. I was expecting it to have issues, but for my 3080 it seems to be running a few games even better. Close to the sun was rather stuttery initially, but after switching to open module, it's been running super well.
 I haven't tested wayland but some hyprland users seem to say it is working with nvidia-open.
 What has your experience been? Are you using it? Any improvements you noticed?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[学习如何用动态链接库将多个 C 目标文件结合到一个单个的可执行文件之中。




当使用 C 编程语言编写一个应用程序时，你的代码通常有多个源文件代码。

最终，这些文件必须被编译到一个单个的可执行文件之中。你可以通过创建静态或动态库（后者也被称为 共享shared 库）来实现这一点。这两种类型的库在创建和链接的方式上有所不同。两者都有缺点和优点，这取决于你的使用情况。

动态链接是最常见的方法，尤其是在 Linux 系统上。动态链接会保持库模块化，因此，很多应用程序可以共享一个库。应用程序的模块化也允许单独更新其依赖的共享库。

在这篇文章中，我将演示动态链接是如何工作的。在后期的文章中，我将演示静态链接。

链接器

链接器linker是一个命令，它将一个程序的数个部分结合在一起，并为它们重新组织内存分配。

链接器的功能包括：


整合一个程序的所有的部分

计算出一个新的内存组织结构，以便所有的部分组合在一起

恢复内存地址，以便程序可以在新的内存组织结构下运行

解析符号引用


链接器通过这些功能，创建了一个名为可执行文件executable的可以运行的程序。在你创建一个动态链接的可执行文件前，你需要一些用来链接的库，和一个用来编译的应用程序。准备好你 最喜欢的文本编辑器 并继续。

创建目标文件

首先，创建带有这些函数签名的头文件 mymath.h ：

int add(int a, int b);
int sub(int a, int b);
int mult(int a, int b);
int divi(int a, int b);


使用这些函数定义来创建 add.c 、sub.c 、mult.c 和 divi.c 文件。我将把所有的代码都放置到一个代码块中，请将其分为四个文件，如注释所示：

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Meta 的 “不落下任何语言No Language Left Behind” 是一个宏大的开源项目，旨在以最高准确度翻译语言。




Meta（前身是 Facebook）在开源世界做出了不小的贡献。Meta 除了专注于元宇宙Metaverse和其社交媒体平台外，还致力于各种研究和创新工作，比如 React（一个 JaveScript 库）。

现在，Meta 的研究人员决定开源一个叫 “不落下任何语言No Language Left Behind” 项目。

（LCTT 校注：这个直译项目名称不够好听，我来抛砖引玉，似可称做“无人独语”，读者有什么建议吗？）

Meta 试图不落下任何语言




目前，虽然世界上有大约 7000 个在使用中的语言，但大多数在线的内容都是以少数的流行语言来提供的，比如英语。这让许多不懂这些语言的人处于不利的地位。

虽然现存的许多翻译工具，但语法错误会让错误变得难以阅读和理解。另外，如果你想把内容翻译为一个不流行的语言（特别是非洲和亚洲的一些语言），翻译体验不会很好。

因此，Meta 正在开发有最高质量的翻译工具，可以帮助解决这一全球性的问题。

NLLB-200（不落下任何语言No Language Left Behind） 是一个人工智能翻译模型，其可以翻译 200 多种语言。该模型在每种语言中的翻译结果是通过一个名为 FLORES-200 复杂数据集来确定和评估的。

正如 Meta 所说，NLLB 的翻译结果比以前的人工智能研究方法好 40% 。对于一些最不常见的语言，其翻译准确率甚至超过 70%。了不起的工作！

为了帮助开发项目和提高模型的翻译质量，Meta 向所有感兴趣的研究人员开放了源代码，包括 NLLB-200 模型、FLORES-200 数据库、模型训练和重建训练数据库的代码。

你可以在 GitHub 上找到源代码，并且可以在该项目的 博客 上了解它的更多信息。

对社会事业的鼓励

Meta 宣布向从事联合国可持续发展目标UN Sustainable Development Goals任何领域工作和翻译非洲语言的非营利组织和研究人员提供高达 20 万美元的捐赠，也鼓励其他学术领域如语言学和机器翻译的研究人员申请。

项目的影响

尽管 Meta 主要打算在其数字平台上，特别是在“元宇宙”上使用 NLLB，但 NLLB 也有可能在其他领域产生巨大影响。

许多用户可以用他们的母语轻松地访问和阅读在线资源。项目开源后，社区应该能够帮助实现这个目标。

你对 Meta 的这个项目有什么看法？

 来源：澎湃新闻
                

高名潞（章静绘）
创刊于1976年的《十月》（OCTOBER）杂志在北美乃至全球当代艺术系统中扮演着重要的角色，其分析模式和理论风格一度被视为形式主义之后艺术评论的典范。近半个世纪来，围绕“历史唯物主义”“精神分析”“机构批判”“身体政治”“景观”“女性主义”“全球化”“文化战争”“后殖民”“纪念碑”等前沿话题，《十月》展开了一系列批评和写作的激进实验，在艺术系统内外造成了广泛而深远的影响。因此，与其说它是一份专业的当代艺术学术刊物，不如说是一个艺术认知变革的策动者。然而新世纪以来，随着艺术日新月异的变化，《十月》也日渐显现出其保守的一面。特别是互联网时代的来临，使得理论、批评以及艺术媒体皆面临着种种新的危机和挑战。

值此第八届国际艺术评论奖（IAAC 8）启动之际，复旦大学哲学学院与上海民生现代美术馆联合举办了“‘《十月》学派’与当代艺术评论”主题论坛，通过重估《十月》及其理论遗产和当代意义，希望重新唤起一种更具思辨性和批判力的艺术评论与艺术写作。在论坛举办之前，复旦大学哲学学院鲁明军代表《上海书评》采访了美国匹兹堡大学艺术史系高名潞教授。

高名潞教授是'85新潮美术运动重要的参与者和推动者，是1980年代末“中国现代艺术大展”重要的策划者和组织者之一。他在上世纪九十年代初赴美留学，在哈佛大学攻读艺术史博士学位。在此期间，他不仅系统学习了欧美现代艺术理论，还持续参与中美当代艺术的对话实践。他策划了由美国亚洲协会和旧金山美术馆主办、在亚洲协会和PS1当代艺术中心同时展出的“蜕变突破：华人新艺术”（Inside Out：New Chinese Art）大展，并以中国及亚洲部分策展人的身份参与策划了“1950至1980年代的全球观念艺术展”和“五大洲与一个城市”等重要展览。同时，他也是中国最具理…]]></summary>

The telcos here are terrible. I'd love to hear how HN users would think of bootstrapping a telco?
We've had a few startups try and disrupt things in Canada (e.g., Wind Mobile). They were funded by large global investment groups and eventually simply got acquired by the incumbent telcos.
The other approach I've seen is piggybacking on existing telco infrastructure. This is required by law since the Canadian government subsidizes telco infrastructure... It's not uncommon for the telcos to renege on their contractual/legal obligations. Plus, this doesn't create any redundant networks.
So: how else can one launch a telco? What creative solutions have folks seen?
I'm thinking: VOIP-only service that has direct access to the Internet backbone in Toronto, Vancouver, etc. so you can at least have completely separate service in major cities... Or crowdfunding 5G towers (though I imagine spectrum licensing is an issue here).
Would love to hear what other HN readers think.

Pluton 是微软公司于 2020 年首次推出的 Windows PC 安全协处理器。与 TPM 一道，其旨在增强 Windows 操作系统的安全性。联想发布的新款 ThinkPad Z13 和 Z16 笔记本电脑就支持 Pluton。然而，有 Linux 专家发现，无法在 ThinkPad Z13 笔记本电脑上，通过 USB 来启动 Linux。这是因为 Pluton 默认只接受 Windows 引导加载和配套驱动程序，使用第三方 UEFI 证书的 Linux 发行版会被阻止启动。联想证实，从 2022 年起，该公司开始遵循微软给出的 PC 安全启动建议，并于默认情况下禁用第三方证书。

Ubuntu 将 Firefox Snap 启动速度提升了一倍

Canonical 在一篇博文中披露，“与 Firefox 101 相比，全新安装版本的启动时间平均减少了 50%。”这是由于 Firefox 改成了在启动时一次只复制一个环境 / 语言包（而不是所有语言包），区域设置将遵循系统设置，因而大幅缩减了启动等待时间。以及将 Firefox 及其 GNOME 和 GTK 主题的 Snap 软件包从 XZ 切换到 LZO，加快了解压/启动速度。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[NTFS 是 Windows NT 系列操作系统支持的磁盘文件系统格式，它是一个特别为网络和磁盘配额、文件加密等管理安全特性设计的文件系统。而 Linux 内核中新进入主线支持的 NTFS3 驱动是一个功能齐全的 NTFS 驱动程序，该驱动程序适用于最高的 NTFS 3.1 版本。


简介

最初，Linux 内核没有 NTFS 的原生支持，后来对 NTFS 的支持也仅提供了只读功能。来自 Tuxera 的 NTFS-3G 是之前主流的解决方案，但在实际使用中也存在一些问题。NTFS-3G 是借助 Linux 的用户空间文件系统（FUSE）模块在用户层实现的一个对 NTFS 支持的文件系统，其对 NTFS 的访问逻辑代码都是在用户层代码实现的。

在 NTFS3 出现之前，Linux 上使用 NTFS 主要问题还是缺乏稳定且功能齐全的读/写支持。

2020 年，Paragon 软件公司做出了一个惊人的决定：尝试将之前只提供给商业客户的 NTFS3 驱动程序贡献到 Linux 主线。最终，在经过多轮审核和修改之后，Linux 内核 5.15 合并了 Paragon 提供的 NTFS3 内核驱动，它拥有更高的性能和更多的特性。


该驱动程序实现了对 NTFS 文件系统中的正常、稀疏和压缩文件的读/写支持。

支持本地日志回放。

支持已挂载的 NTFS 卷的 NFS 导出。

支持文件和文件夹的权限管理。




如何使用 NTFS3 驱动挂载 NTFS 卷

使用 NTFS3 驱动挂载时使用的文件系统类型是 ntfs3。

手动挂载

以前使用 NTFS-3g 驱动的挂载方式是：

# mount -t ntfs-3g /dev/sdxY /mnt


现在只需要将 ntfs-3g 替换为 ntfs3 即可：

# mount -…]]></summary>

《浮动的海岸：一部白令海峡的环境史》，[美]芭丝谢芭·德穆思著，刘晓卉译，译林出版社2022年5月出版，398页，88.00元
在我的想象中，环境史有两类，作为查漏补缺的、狭义的环境史和按照历史新思维构建的、广义的环境史。自环境史研究诞生以来，前者比比皆是，后者尚付阙如，以至于无论是教学还是指导博士生研究环境史，我都很难给学生提供一个学习和模仿广义环境史的范本。《浮动的海岸：一部白令海峡环境史》的出版解决了这一难题，它既能满足学生的需求，又为推进广义环境史研究提供了良好的新起点。

历史的本质：超越人类中心主义

该书的问题意识是：当自然或环境进入历史时，历史的本质是什么？具体而言，就是在自然塑造了人的前提下，人又如何被这个世界重塑？显然，这是要在环境整体中探讨人与环境的相互作用的历史。这个问题意识的产生既源于作者自十八岁以来多次在白令吉亚生活、工作和研究的现场体验，也源于对传统历史学的反思。在独特的北极环境中，作者体会到了自然的伟岸，在与当地人一起工作和生活中，作者受到了当地人关于环境的知识的影响。这些都让作者不得不放下来自工业社会的惯习，转而从整体认识人在环境中的位置和作用。也正是在这样的环境中，自柯林伍德以来把环境剔除出历史编撰的传统史学思维变得不合时宜，建构一种新型历史成为作者要完成的任务。

全书按空间分为五个部分，依次从海洋越过海岸到陆地，从地表到地下，最后重新回到海洋。从空间上把海陆连为白令吉亚，从时间上涵盖了从十九世纪中期到现在的全过程。正是在这样的“时间地图”环境中，当地人（因纽皮亚特人、尤皮克人、楚克奇人）、美国人、苏联人和鲸鱼、海象、狐狸以及黄金和锡矿等上演了复杂精彩的，融环境、经济、社会和文化于一体的多幕生态戏剧。十九世纪后半期（1848-1900），美国捕鲸者闯入北太…]]></summary>

如果你发现浏览你的 Git 仓库非常复杂，我已经为你准备好了工具，来了解一下 Tig。

Tig 是一个 基于 ncurses 的 Git 文本模式界面，它允许你浏览 Git 仓库中的更改。它还可以充当各种 Git 命令输出的分页器。使用这个工具可以让我很好地了解在哪个提交中发生了哪些更改，最新的提交合并是什么等等。请跟随这个简短的教程，亲自尝试一下。

安装 Tig

在 Linux 上，你可以使用包管理器安装 Tig。例如，在 Fedora 和 Mageia 上：

$ sudo dnf install tig


在 Debian、Linux Mint、Elementary、Pop_OS 和其他基于 Debian 的发行版上：

$ sud apt install tig


在 macOS 上，使用 MacPorts 或 Homebrew。 Tig 的完整安装指南可在 Tig 手册 中找到。

使用 Tig

Tig 提供了常见 Git 输出的交互式视图。例如，使用 Git，你可以使用命令 git show-ref 查看所有引用：

$ git show-ref
98b108... refs/heads/master
6dae95... refs/remotes/origin/1010-internal-share-partition-format-reflexion
84e1f8... refs/remotes/origin/1015-add-libretro-openlara
e62c7c... refs/remotes/origin/1016-add-support-for-retroarch-project-cd
1c29a8... refs/remotes/origin/1066-add-libretro-mess
ffd3f53... refs/remotes/origin/1155-automatically-generate-assets-for-external-installers
ab4d14... refs/remotes/origin/1160-release-on-bare-metal-servers
28baa9... refs/remotes/origin/1180-ipega-pg-9118
8dff1d... refs/remotes/origin/1181-add-libretro-dosbox-core-s
81a7fe... refs/remotes/origin/1189-allow-manual-build-on-master
[...]


使用 Tig，你可以在可滚动列表中获取该信息以及更多信息，此外还可以使用键盘快捷键来打开其他视图，其中包含每个引用的详细信息。



分页模式

当输入来自标准输入时，Tig 进入分页模式。当指定 show 子命令并给出 --stdin 选项时，标准输入被假定为提交 ID 列表，它被转发到 git-show ：

$ git rev-list --author=sumantrom HEAD | tig show –stdin


日志和差异视图

当你在 Tig 的日志视图中时，你可以按键盘上的 d 键来显示差异。这将显示提交中更改的文件以及删除和添加的行。

交互式 Git 数据

Tig 是对 Git 的一个很好的补充。它鼓励你探索日志，而无需构建冗长且有时复杂的查询，从而可以轻松查看你的 Git 仓库。

立即将 Tig 添加到你的 Git 工具包中！

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[当地时间7月8日，特斯拉公司首席执行官埃隆·马斯克表示，将终止对推特的收购，理由是推特严重违反了协议中的多项条款，包括虚假账户的问题。
　　马斯克在给推特首席法律顾问的信中表示，因为推特不愿意分享马斯克要求的信息，所以终止收购，且现有信息证明了，目前推特的虚假账户数量远超过公司对外声明的数量。马斯克认为，推特做出了虚假和误导性陈述。
　　马斯克此番表态公布没多久，推特方面随即回击表示，要将马斯克告上法庭。
　　Twitter董事长Bret Taylor表示，董事会致力于按照与马斯克约定的条款完成交易，并计划采取法律行动执行合并协议，推特有信心在在特拉华州衡平法院胜诉。
　　马斯克一直要求推特方面公布虚假账户数量，早在5月17日，马斯克就表示，在推特CEO公开证明推特上虚假账户少于5%之前，他不会继续收购推特的交易。根据推特的业绩报告，推特的虚假账户占用户总数的不到5％。
　　4月14日，马斯克向推特发出440亿美元收购邀约，仅10天后，推特官宣接受马斯克对其私有化。4月25日，推特宣布同意马斯克的收购协议，后者将以每股54.2美元，总计约440亿美元的价格收购推特。收购消息公布后，推特股价一度涨至54.57美元。
　　正当外界已经开始探讨马斯克将如何改造推特时，不确定性却纷至沓来。期间，马斯克多次针对推特发布负面言论，从商业模式到审核政策都数落了一遍。后因质疑推特自行披露的虚假账户占比，马斯克搁置了该交易。经过长达数周的僵局，6月8日，推特终向马斯克妥协，表示将提供全部推特用户发布推文的数据流。
　　值得注意的是，随着推特股价接连走低，与马斯克此前给出的每股54.2美元的现金收购价价差正在继续扩大。股价反映出市场对这项交易顺利完成的没有很大信心，有不少市场人士猜测马斯克很可能会放弃这笔440亿美元的收购计划。
　　《纽约时报》此前就表示，马斯克一直在试图退出交易或重新谈判以获取更低的价格，美股科技公司的股票一直受挫，包括马斯克主要财富来源特斯拉。从4月25日宣布交易以来，推特股价下跌接近30%，特斯拉股价下跌接近25%。
　　当地时间6月16日上午，马斯克以视频形式和8000多名推特员工进行了长达一个多小时的问答。这是他表态要收购推特后首次与员工交流。《纽约时报》写道，马斯克本次参会，意味着他正准备完成这笔重磅收购。在交流会上，对于能否完成收购交易这个市场最为关注的问题，马斯克并未提及。且据彭博社报道，在场并没有人向马斯克问及这一问题。
　　截至7月8日美股收盘，推特收跌4.85%，报收36.91美元，盘后一度跌逾12%。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi. I am trying to make a Firefox-Based Operating System from Linux. Why, you may ask?
 I've played around with Firefox. And it seems like It's got some basic necessities
 For example:
 File Manager
 ​
 (Startpage.com) Calculator
 Although, I could try and make another one
 ​
 (clocktab.com) (Customized) Clock App
 Like the Calculator, I could also try and make another Clock App
 ​
 Fully Functioning Image Viewer
 There's Also a Video Player, But It's not the smoothest
 ​
 (idenati.com) Website Manager (Had to use a different browser because Firefox didn't let me log in)
 And much more
 ​
 But, most of the apps I've shown aren't open-source.
 ​
 So, would It be possible to:
 - Make multiple open-source Web Apps
 - Create a whole Operating System from a browser (E.g. ChromeOS)
 ​
 If possible, I would make this a thing. But, I would need some help
 Best Regards

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Probably old news to most here, but new to me.. Just got my SteamDeck in.
 Physically the unit is a little larger than anticipated. This is good, as the screen is also bigger. Though not *big*, but bigger than a Switch. 
 I got the mid-range Steam Deck with 256G storage. I'm not much of a gamer but played a few games including Dying Light, Road96 and a couple others. They played fine and I didn't notice any weirdness or incompatibilities. It is easy enough to use that were I to buy any other games, it would be my first choice versus one of the laptops. Performance is better than my Android tablets.
 The Desktop mode was interesting. It looks just like a desktop and when attached to a monitor and keyboard, is perfectly serviceable as a minimal desktop. At work, a good 80% of my time is in a tmux terminal, 10% in a browser, and 10% in VSCode. The trackpad was serviceable as a mouse, but definitely worth connecting a proper mouse (bluetooth is supported). No issues with my keyboards (both US and German). Bluetooth seems solid and not laggy.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I made "I Spy Notify", which lets you watch Linux desktop notifications and run scripts for each notification. It's great for (but not limited to!) logging, displaying popups, and playing sounds.
 You can visit the GitHub repository here: https://github.com/haritkapadia/i-spy-notify.
 The project comes with an XDG Desktop file and a System-D service file. The configuration file is ~/.config/i-spy-notify.json. Example configurations are in the doc/examples folder. The project is written in C.
 Here's some fun things I learned about Linux notifications while working on I Spy Notify.
  
There are many ways to send image data over a notification. You can: 
 Send a key word that is associated with an icon (for example, "camera-photo" represents an image of a camera in your current icon theme).
 Send a path to the image.
 Send the image as a byte stream (the format is basically an array of pixels, and is very similar to the GdkPixbuf struct).
 
 Notifications can be replaced by other notifications, if the application requests it.
 When an application sends a notification, it may first query the notification daemon for the server's capabilities, which explain what features of the standard that the daemon supports.
 dbus-monitor monitors a bus by sending a message to the bus that requests that the connection established by dbus-monitor becomes a monitor connection. If there is already a notification daemon running (which there usually is), I create a monitor connection in the same way.

the way that they package software has been relatively static.  While the

pushing for change, though.  Both the Fedora and openSUSE projects are

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[7月7日，据北京法院审判信息网显示，刘翔与北京新东方前途出国咨询有限公司（下称新东方前途出国）网络侵权纠纷一审、二审判决书公开。
　　刘翔起诉称，2016年8月9日，新东方前途出国未经允许，在微信公众号“新东方美国中学留学”发布《从8年前的刘翔到今年的傅园慧，中国这才真正强大起来》一文，使用数幅刘翔肖像照片，文章末尾附有“美国小常青藤中学全国巡展”的广告宣传及商业宣传信息，构成对刘翔肖像权的侵害。
　　刘翔向法院提出诉讼，要求被告在全国公开发行的报纸及其官方微信公众号上连续六十日赔礼道歉，并赔偿经济损失及精神损害抚慰金15万元、维权合理开支5000元。
　　新东方前途出国辩称，在获知被控侵权事实后立即对前述文章进行了删除处理，主观上并无侵权故意，且客观上亦未给刘翔造成损失，刘翔主张的赔偿金额过高。
　　经法院认定，微信公众号后台信息截图显示，前述文章已删除，且删除时阅读量为676。
　　一审认为，新东方前途出国构成对刘翔肖像权的侵害，涉案文章虽使用刘翔肖像，但相关图片均系刘翔赛场照片，并未对刘翔肖像进行丑化、污损，侵权行为轻微，判令书面致歉。酌情确定刘翔经济损失数额为6000元。
　　7月7日，北京云亭律师事务所合伙人位艳玲向界面教育表示，此类肖像权案，如果被告使用肖像照片进行商业性使用，会根据该人物的知名度、影响范围以及被告有无获利等因素进行综合考虑后判决。
　　“判赔6000元主要基于它的使用形式，（该肖像照）是在文章中使用，和单独拿刘翔的照片贴在某个特别显眼的地方，比如广告牌、网站首页等单独显示的场景，情节是不一样的。法院会考虑很多情节。”位艳玲告诉界面教育。
　　刘翔并非首位因公众号文章使用其照片而起诉的明星。2020年，一自媒体博主因未经许可使用艺人鞠婧祎的肖像，而被告上法庭。一审法院判决驳回了鞠婧祎的全部诉讼请求，认为该微信公众号发布涉案文章并非以营利为目的，也非利用鞠婧祎的商业价值进行引流、提高销量，因此不存在过错，不应当承担侵权责任。
　　鞠婧祎不服一审判决，向上海一中院提起上诉。二审再次败诉。鞠婧祎肖像权案的判决书写道：“原告作为演艺圈公众人物，对社会公众就其公开发布的照片进行评价理应负有一定的容忍义务。”
　　在明星肖像权案中，更美、新氧等医美平台公众号发布的推文由于经常涉及对明星整容的猜测和判断，遭到不少明星起诉。
　　天眼查App显示，知名医美平台“更美App”的运营主体北京完美创意科技有限公司（下称北京完美公司），自2019年至今，共发生24件肖像权纠纷，涉及靳东、赵丽颖、唐嫣、胡杏儿等多位艺人。
　　在和明星肖像权诉争中，北京完美公司多次被判败诉、赔偿。例如，2020年，其被判赔偿刘诗施经济损失13万元，并在公众号连续10日刊登致歉声明；被判赔偿吴静怡合计超20万元等。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[由于上游的一些改进，Fedora Linux 37 将引入对树莓派 4 的正式支持。




Fedora Linux 的工作站版很适合台式机使用。不过，如果你想让它用于服务器或物联网需求，可以使用 Fedora ARM 项目。

它也支持树莓派，只是最新的树莓派 4 除外（其实早在 2019 年就发布了）。

现在，随着 Phoronix 发现的一项拟议的变化，看起来 Fedora Linux 37 可能会正式增加对树莓派 4 的支持。

目前还不是正式的...

到现在为止，对树莓派 4 的支持只是一个拟议的变化。

Fedora Linux 通常会公开其拟议的变化列表，以接受社区反馈并让其他人跟踪其进展。

所以，Fedora Linux 37 中的正式支持只有在得到 Fedora 工程指导委员会的批准后才会实施。

但是，支持树莓派 4 的阻碍是什么呢？

这是由于缺乏加速图形以及缺失一些功能，所以不方便增加对它的支持。

现在，随着新的 Linux 内核和 Mesa 的上游工作为树莓派 4 带来了图形加速功能，可以让他们启用对它的支持。

拟议的变化文件中提到：


上游现在支持使用 V3D GPU 的 OpenGL-ES 和 Vulkan 加速图形。对有线网络也有增强，支持 CM4/4B 上的 PTPv2。


此外，不仅仅是引入对树莓派 4 的支持，一些拟议的变化还涉及对树莓派 3 系列和 Zero 2 W 的改进。

因此，如果如人们所期望的那样发生，这应该是一个有趣的变化。

请注意，对树莓派 400 的 Wi-Fi 的支持不是这个过程的一部分，但对音频支持的测试将是这个变化的一部分。

你可以在 拟议文件 中阅读所有的细节。

你对 Fedora Linux 37 对树莓派 4 的支持有什么看法？请在下面的评论中分享你的想法。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If this post is offtopic, sorry, please delete it (I'm using an old Lenovo laptop and I'm not aware of recent developments among manufacturers), this is not a support request, I'm just wondering what you make of this article: 
 Lenovo shipping new laptops that only boot Windows by default
 It seems to be specific to the new Z13 Lenovo series, from what I get, if you plug a Knoppix, Ubuntu or Tails USB stick in them out of the box you are out of luck because they won't boot and you need to tinker with the firmware first (assuming you can do that).
 What do you think? Is it just a rant about Lenovo's default option in the firmware that can be changed easily, or step by step, Microsoft's idea of Palladium has finally arrived to chain us all into Windows with all major manufacturers following this trend? Thanks in advance for your insight.

由于担心美国的监控行为，欧洲法院于 2020 年废除了一项名为“隐私保护”的欧盟-美国数据流动协议。在其裁决中，它还使美国公司用来向美国转移个人数据的另一个法律工具，即标准合同条款（SCC）更难使用。爱尔兰数据保护委员会周四通知其同行，它将阻止 Facebook 将用户数据从欧洲发送到美国。这一草拟的决定意味着 Facebook 也被迫停止依赖 SCC。Meta 公司曾多次警告说，这样的决定将使其在欧洲的包括 Facebook 和 Instagram 在内的许多服务关闭。

老王点评：欧洲人，别怕，你看我们没有这种东西，不是也有别的嘛 :<




Chrome 优化后台页面处理策略，提升笔记本电池时间

Chrome 是耗能大户，因此在笔记本电脑上非常影响电池使用时间。Chrome 在最新的版本中增加了一个新的“快速强化节流”策略。该功能可以在 10 秒后停止后台页面加载 JavaScript 元素，而之前的限制是 5 分钟，并且它将限制唤醒定时任务，最多每分钟 1 次。谷歌称，这有望延长电池使用时长，当所有标签都被隐藏和静止时，CPU 占用有 10% 的改善。该功能过段时间才会进入稳定通道。


消息来源：Tech Radar



老王点评：感觉浏览器技术和 Web 技术无止境啊，Chrome 能占有这么大的市场，可见并非侥幸。




推特每天删除上百万个垃圾账户

之前，马斯克威胁要停止 440 亿美元的收购推特的交易，除非该公司拿出证据，证明垃圾机器人账户占看到广告的用户中不到 5%。推特在周四的一次简报会中说，推特每天删除超过 100 万个垃圾账户。该公司重申，人工审查人员随机检查了数千个账户，并使用公共和私人数据的组合，以计算该比例，在接受广告服务的用户中，垃圾账户远低于 5%。


消息来源：路透社



老王点评：虽然我认为马斯克在玩弄花招，但是要说推特只有 5% 的垃圾机器人账号，我是不信的。]]></summary>

有时你需要在 Linux 中隐藏文件。

不要误会，我不是指那些你不想让你的家人看到的“特殊文件”。尽管你可以隐藏这些特殊文件，但更好的办法还是用密码锁定它们以提供额外的保护。

回到隐藏文件的话题。名称以 . 开头的任何文件或文件夹在 Linux 中是“隐藏的”。

Linux 有很多这样的文件和文件夹，在普通视图中它们是隐藏的。这些主要是系统和程序所需的配置文件。

用户通常不需要理会它们，因此它们在普通视图中是隐藏的，这样一来你就不会被许多看起来很奇怪的而不是你所创建的文件所淹没。

下图展示了我的主目录中隐藏的文件和文件夹。





如果你使用的是桌面版 Linux，你可以通过在文件管理器中按 Ctrl+H 快捷键来轻松 查看隐藏文件。在终端中，你可以使用 ls -a 命令显示隐藏文件和普通文件。

那么，如何在 Linux 中创建隐藏文件呢？你只需用一个在命名的时候加一个 . 前缀。就是这样。

在桌面版 Linux 里创建隐藏文件和文件夹（GUI 方法）

如果你使用的是文件管理器，在文件或文件夹上右键并选择重命名选项。现在你所要做的就是在文件名的开头添加一个 .。

当你以这种方式创建隐藏文件时，GNOME 的 Nautilus 文件管理器也会显示一个警告。



你可以以相同的方式隐藏文件夹及其所有内容。

你可以按 Ctrl+H 键来显示隐藏文件。哦！我是多么的喜欢 Ubuntu 中的键盘快捷键 和我使用的任何其他程序或操作系统！

要使隐藏文件变回普通文件，只需再次重命名这些文件删掉文件名前缀的 . 即可。

在 Linux 终端创建隐藏文件和文件夹（CLI 方法）

如果你热衷于终端，你…]]></summary>

 来源：澎湃新闻
                

《作茧自缚：人类早期国家的深层历史》，[美]詹姆斯·C. 斯科特著，田雷译，中国政法大学出版社，2022年5月出版，362页，79.00元
对于中文读者来说，耶鲁大学教授詹姆斯·斯科特（James Scott）并不是一个陌生的名字。他的著作《农民的道义经济学》（The Moral Economy of the Peasant, 1976）、《弱者的武器》（Weapons of the Weak, 1987）、《国家的视角》（Seeing Like a State, 1999）以及《逃避统治的艺术》（The Art of Not Being Governed, 2010）早已成为社会学、人类学、政治学乃至法学研究中的重要作品。他对现代国家微观政治权力运作逻辑的剖析，不仅常常揭示出有意无意间被层层历史叙事掩盖的真相，还往往在字里行间让我们领会到支配现代社会生活的诸般符咒的荒诞与孱弱。他在八十一岁高龄时推出的Against the Grain: A Deep History of the Earliest States（Yale University Press, 2017）则将目光延伸向了远方，试图挖掘人类早期国家形成这一宏大历史叙事背后的潜隐剧本。

本书主标题“Against the Grain”是斯科特有意为之的双关。这个词在英语中意指事与愿违，它含蓄地提醒读者本书将采用社会科学领域常见的叙事策略，即关注人类有意为之的活动所带来的不期而至或出乎意料的结果。同时，本书的核心内容是谷物的种植与税收促使人类早期国家形成，但社会分化与奴役等种种不幸也随之而来，因此这个标题又包含着斯科特本人的立场与倾向。本书的繁体中文版将这个题目直译为“反谷”，似有谐音“反骨”之意（翁德明译，麦田出版社，2019年）；田雷…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[大流行加快了印度全国数字化转型的速度，这需要对数据中心进行更多投资。由于快速的数字化和云采用，印度数据中心市场的容量预计在未来几年将翻一番。据报道，2021 年印度数据中心市场规模为 43.5 亿美元，到 2027 年将达到 100.9 亿美元，2022-2027 年的复合年增长率为 15.07%。

现在，出现的一个关键问题是印度数据中心行业的未来是什么？哪些新趋势将塑造其未来？下面提到的是将对印度数据中心行业产生重大影响的主要趋势。

数据本地化

数据本地化就意味着限制数据从一个国家流向另一个国家。印度政府已发布指导方针，强调需要在该国境内存储印度用户的数据。数据本地化使得收集关键消费者数据的公司必须在本地数据中心存储和处理这些数据。这给本地数据中心带来了巨大的增长。此外，印度的成本优势和熟练劳动力的便利性使其成为亚洲数据中心的重要枢纽。

可持续数据中心

众所周知，数据中心消耗大量非可再生资源。为了使数据中心可持续发展，公司重新设计了他们的设施，通过利用人工智能、机器学习和云等新兴技术来大大降低电力和水的消耗。云数据中心使用更少的服务器，从而减少碳排放。它们通常位于更靠近为其供电的设施，以防止在长距离传输电能的过程中出现大量损失。此外，公共云数据中心可用于存储来自多个业务的数据。本地数据中心在存储大量数据时存在容量限制，从而导致资源的非最佳使用。因此，云数据中心通过使企业能够消耗更少的服务器和更少的电力并减少其在此过程中的碳排放，正在彻底改变行业。

边缘连接

边缘数据中心是靠近网络边缘的小型数据中心。它们通常连接到更大的中央数据中心或多个数据中心。通过处理更接近最终用户的数据和服务，边缘计算允许组织减少延迟并改善客户体验。这样的数据中心对于需要实时数据处理的行业非常有利，例如自动驾驶汽车、远程医疗、电信、OTT 平台和智能可穿戴设备。

超大规模数据中心

传统上，数据中心是一个简单的机架网络，带有存储单元和一组管理工具。它具有易于理解的架构。然而，随着数字化转型接管了企业界，组织开始生成大量数据。传统的存储单元和工具不足以处理大量涌入的数据，因此需要更大的容量和复杂的设施。此外，传统数据中心无法扩大或缩小其能力以适应需求波动，从而导致资源浪费。这导致了超大规模作为解决方案的演变。

超大规模数据中心是大规模的关键业务设施，旨在通过将大量高速协同工作的服务器聚集在一起，有效地支持强大且可扩展的应用。这种能力使数据中心能够水平和垂直扩展。

总之，数据中心行业正在发展，新趋势将不断涌现。借助新时代的颠覆性技术，数据中心行业可以构建环保节能的数据中心。人工智能、边缘计算和物联网等技术可用于最大限度地提高能源效率并最大限度地减少对环境的影响。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[看来微软拿了一手好牌，在 Linux 和开源方面取得行业成功。




出于某种原因，微软在开源和 Linux 方面总是受到关注。

而且，当我们谈论 Linux 开发者时，它也会成为焦点……为什么会这样？

微软似乎正在为一系列的项目招聘大量 Linux 开发人员。而且，一个知名人物也加入了这个名单。

据 Phoronix 报道，systemd 和 PulseAudio 的创建者 Lennart Poettering，现在已在微软工作，继续专注于 systemd 的开发。

或许你不知道，Lennart 曾在红帽工作，领导 PulseAudio 项目和其他一些事情。

除了 Lennart 之外，Python 之父 Guido Van Rossum 等一些关键的开发人员之前就加入了微软。

（LCTT 译注：据 Phoronix 总结，还有更多的开源开发者加入了（或加入过）微软，这包括：GNOME 创建者 Miguel de Icaza 曾在 2016 年微软收购 Xamarin 时受雇，到今年早些时候离开；Nat Friedman 作为 Xamarin 的成员在微软收购后加入，后担任微软旗下的 GitHub 的 CEO；Gentoo Linux 创始人 Daniel Robbins 之前受雇于微软；Steve French 作为 Linux CIFS/SMB2/SMB3 的维护者和 Samba 团队的成员为微软工作；以及大量的上游 Linux 开发者，如 Matteo Croce、Matthew Wilcox、Tyler Hicks、Shyam Prasad N、Michael Kelley、Christian Brauner 等等也曾被微软雇佣。）

微软在为最佳状态做准备

毫不奇怪，微软希望提高其对基于开源的项目的关注，并尽可能有效地利用 Linux 为其业务服务。

Azure 平台对开源的利用最多，而且，不要忘了 Windows Subsystem for Linux（WSL）。

因此，微软一直在招聘 Linux 开发人员。如果你想试试，你会在 微软职业 栏目中找到很多与 Linux 有关的职位。

虽然这对微软的产品线来说是一件大事，但它一般不会影响到 Linux 桌面用户。事实上，我认为，Linux 开发者得到的资源越多，由于他们工作角色转换，他们可以帮助 Linux 生态系统更好地增强其愿景。

当然，让所有关键的 Linux 开发者都在微软拥有的项目上工作并不是一件喜闻乐见的事情，但是，事实就是如此。

微软正在做正确的事情

这不仅仅是经济上的回报，Linux 开发者加入微软团队的趋势意味着他们在开源和 Linux 上的一些努力是成功的。

只要微软努力改善 Linux 生态系统，我认为我们就没有什么可担心的。

我不想被提醒“拥抱、扩展和熄灭Embrace, extend, and extinguish”（3E）。毕竟，这对所有公司来说都是生意。当涉及到赚钱的决定时，没有人应该被认为是英雄。

因此，我们只能希望微软在不久的将来为 Linux 开发者和用户准备好一些好东西。

你对此有何看法？在下面的评论区分享你的想法。

Main reason - everything I can do on Linux - I can do Windows, but not vise-versa. Ok I can't play games on Linux, I left gaming. Ok I can't run engineering software on Linux, I didn't engineer anything. I can't reverse-engineer and debug Windows software on Linux, so I didn't do that. I didn't do anything productive and positive in that period of time. I learned that in Linux you choose already written software, configure it manually in text configs (benefit: man command with manuals). And on Windows you also choose already written software, configure it via GUI or command line, or text configs. Anything changed.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This seems to be a very small distro and the dev apparently doesn't have any interest in a Reddit presence...hasn't even made it to DistroWatch yet. I'm not here to plug the thing technically, it's easy to Google, but I'm wondering if anyone's tried it yet, before I start messing with it in a VM? Any experience or thoughts on it?
 EDIT: ok, I've installed it, and here are my thoughts. It's pretty much a basic Arch install, with a moderately heavy Plasma desktop that incorporates a top menu and Latte. Not as heavy as Garuda, but more than Endeavour. The OS doesn't install everything and the kitchen sink like Garuda, but it does give you this set of startup dialogs that ask you if you want to install this stuff. Probably a better implementation than the way RebornOS or ArcosLinux does it (a huge list of checkboxes), and at least it's easy enough to close and get rid of. Not a fan of the heavy theming but they do claim to be all about the eye candy, so I'm not surprised it's there. I suppose it'll serve a purpose if it gathers enough community, but for now, I'll pass. It's filling a niche that I'm not so sure exists yet. Wouldn't mind seeing that after-install tool ported to other Arch variants though.

I've designed the site based on what I wanted a couple of years ago when I had been looking for a remote job. It's very early and any feedback is appreciated.
I've also used this opportunity to reduce some of that front-end framework fatigue by using just HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
Edit: I'll add location and salary filters as soon as I wake up tomorrow

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I had vanilla Ubuntu for ages. It worked fine. Then I started coming across videos by Distro Tube, ThePrimeagen, Brodie Robertson, Linux experiment and more, and the ecosystem opens up to me.
 I tried AwesomeWM, am currently driving LeftWM, I switched from Bash in Gnome Terminal to Fish in Alacritty, I installed Thunar, and a few more programs. I think much of these changes suit me better than vanilla Ubuntu.
 However, it has left me somewhat worried as well. I discovered these programs through YouTube. Deeper than that, I discovered that there were issues at all with my original setup. I see that things are better now, but I never stopped to notice it was bad in the first place.
 So I never thought to look for tiling window managers, never imagined that it was a thing, because I was desensitized to the floating Gnome window manager. I was doing mostly fine with Bash in GTerm, and didn't think much of it. I didn't realize that these programs had problems that could be solved before I saw videos praising the solutions.
 Is there a good way to discover this kind of minor everyday friction and check if ready-made solutions exist? Or is it mostly about having lots of feelers out and wait for word of mouth of some new software to reach you before you start to ask whether it actually solves a problem for you?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey guys, 
 During my journey in the Linux sphere I stumbled upon a lot of content, especially Youtube videos that promote the use of Firefox to counter the rise of Chromium based browsers. 
 I completely understand that using another browser than Google Chrome is important to avoid a browser monopoly but I don't really understand the war that many Linux/FOSS enthusiasts leads against Chromium based browsers.
 I don't see Blink (Chromium) as a competitor to Gecko (Firefox) but more as a successor. Gecko is old (even if heavily maintained) and is slower than Blink in many ways (it is perceptible to the end user and benchmarks proves it). 
 Blink is like Gecko an open source project and even if Google is at the lead of the project they can't really do anything that goes against the interests of the users or developers without suffering from a huge backlash. And even if they try to put their interests first there will always be communities to fork the project and remove Google's shit (ungoogled-chromium is an already existing example). And I am nearly sure that there will be in the future someone or a company to fork Blink and create a new engine, putting Blink at the same place where Gecko is currently. 
 For me the main reason to stop using Gecko based browsers is for compatibility, if all browsers end up sharing the same foundations, thanks to Blink, creating a website would be a much easier process and it might save time (and mental sanity) to a lot of developers all around the world while not compromising on privacy for the end user. 
 I am completely conscious that I might be wrong as a lot of more grown people from the community don't share my opinion but usually the explanations are limited to "do this to avoid a monopoly" so I wanted at least some reasons for this "war" against Blink/Chromium.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[据彭博社7月7日援引知情人士消息报道称，苹果公司计划推出面向极限运动员的Apple Watch，这款手表将使用迄今为止最大的智能手表显示屏、更大的电池和坚固的金属外壳。
　　上述报道称，这款智能手表的屏幕面积将比目前最大的苹果手表多出约7%，使用更大的屏幕可以一次在表盘上显示更多的健身指标或信息。显示器的分辨率约为410*502，并与现有型号保持相同的整体清晰度。上述消息或在今年晚些时候与另外两款Apple Watch一同发布。
　　此外，报道还指出，与标准Apple Watch相比，这款面向极限运动员的手表将使用坚固的金属材料而不是铝，具有更抗碎的屏幕，并包含更大的电池，可以让运动员实现更长时间的运动追踪。
　　对于上述消息，苹果发言人未发表评论。
　　Apple Watch于2015年首次发布，已成为苹果硬件产品线的重要组成部分，这些手表产品隶属于苹果可穿戴设备、家居和配饰部门，该部门在上一财年营收384亿美元，占苹果公司总收入的10%。该部门也面临与谷歌、三星电子等公司的同类产品竞争。
　　苹果预计在今年9月秋季新品发布会上公布新一代的Apple Watch，还有新一代iPhone。目前苹果在售的Apple Watch分别为去年发布的Apple Watch S7系列，老款的Apple Watch S3系列，以及低端版Apple Watch SE。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[苹果将发布 Lockdown 模式以抵御间谍软件攻击

苹果手机曾遭间谍软件 Pegasus 的秘密入侵，为了抵御此类攻击苹果公司宣布了 Lockdown 模式。它将在今年秋天随 iOS 16、iPadOS 16 和 macOS Ventura 发布，旨在为极少数用户提供可选的极端保护。该模式将包括下列保护功能：图片之外的绝大多数信息附件类型将被拦截，链接预览等部分功能将被禁用；JIT JavaScript 编译器等将被禁用，除非列入受信站点白名单；向用户发起的 FaceTime 通话等邀请与服务请求将被拦截，除非用户此前向对方发起过通话或请求；iPhone 锁定时，与电脑或配件的有线连接也将被拦截。开启后将无法安装配置文件，且设备无法加入移动设备管理。苹果表示，如果安全研究人员在 Lockdown 模式中发现漏洞，它将提供业界顶级的最高 200 万美元的奖金。


消息来源：苹果



老王点评：我觉得这不算是极少数用户的需要，至少其中部分功能是大部分人都需要的。




亚马逊预览 AI 编程助手 CodeWhisperer

和微软的 GitHub Copilot 类似，CodeWhisperer 也使用开源代码库进行训练，根据上下文向开发者提供代码完成建议。Copilot 因为代码许可证方面的问题引发了争议，CodeWhisperer 存在类似的问题，但它的做法要好一些，在提供示例代码建议时它会给出代码的来源，开发者将能知道是来自于是可以自由使用的 MIT 授权代码，还是来自于对使用有所限制的 GPL 授权代码。


消息来源：AWS



老王点评：Copilot 增加类似的功能似乎也不难，但问题可能不在这里，而是这类 AI 助手给混淆滥用各种不同许可证的代码带来了便利，从根本上侵蚀了开源的许可证环境。




美国联邦快递将关闭数据中心，退役所有大型机

美国联邦快递（FedEx）称，将在未来两年内关闭其数据中心，并退役其剩余的 20% 大型机。该公司的目标是建立一个基于云的“零数据中心、零主机”环境，这将每年节省 4 亿美元。其 CIO 在会议上说，“在这十年中，我们一直在努力精简和简化我们的技术和系统。……我们将把剩余的应用程序转移到云原生结构。”


消息来源：Datacenter Dynamics



老王点评：大型机越来越没有市场了，不过取代大型机的是另外一种“大型机” —— 也拥有超大的计算资源和无数的终端，以及供应商锁定。

昨天我们报道过 systemd 作者 Lennart Poettering 离开了红帽，今天的消息显示，他加入了微软，仍将继续专注于 systemd 的开发。微软已经 网罗 了很多开源方面的重要人才。]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[darktable 4.0.0 版本来了，这是一个主要版本，带来了新的功能，简化了用户界面，还有一些其他的改进。




最近，作为其 3.8.x 系列的升级版，darktable 开发人员公布了新的稳定版。

最新的升级带来了新功能、错误修复和重大变化。

darktable 4.0 有什么新内容？

在 darktable 4.0 中，增加了很多功能，并对用户界面进行了一些有意义的重新打造。

让我在此介绍一下关键的亮点：


注意： 这是一次重大版本升级，采用了新的库和配置，与旧版本不兼容。因此，你需要在进行升级之前对你的工作进行备份。


颜色和曝光映射

在曝光和颜色校准模块中，你现在可以定义和保存颜色采集器的目标颜色/曝光度。

这应该有助于你匹配图像中的源对象，并确保一个对象在一批照片中的颜色一致性。

完善的用户界面



用户界面已经进行了改造以改善外观/感觉。首先能看到的是其默认主题改为了 “优雅灰”。

总的来说，填充、边距、颜色、对齐方式和图标等等都得到了改造。也添加了新的可折叠的部分（rgb 通道混合器、曝光、颜色校准），使用户界面更干净，更容易访问。

你会发现许多细微的变化，布局也更合理。

性能变化

在简化用户偏好的同时，该版本还增加了一些优化措施。

你还可以改变性能配置，而不需要重启 darktable。

改进了色彩饱和度处理



Filmic v6（一种新的色彩学）的加入有助于获得更多的饱和度，特别是对于蓝天。

另外正如公告中提到的，可以以最小的破坏性方式恢复，调色应该更安全。除此之外，还为艺术饱和度的变化设计了一个新的信息色彩空间。

总的来说，你应该对这个版本对饱和度控制的改进感到高兴。

其他变化

其他一些值得注意的变化包括：


一个新的“引导式拉普拉斯”方法已被添加到高光重建模块中。

全局颜色选择器工具的改进

一个新的对比度参数

一个新的集合过滤器模块

增加了对 EXR 16 位（半数）浮点数输出的支持。


你可以在其 官方公告帖子 中查看所有的技术细节。

下载 darktable 4.0.0

你可以使用 Flathub 上的 Flatpak 包获得最新版本。写这篇文章时，Snap 包还没有更新。

此外，你也可以选择使用其 GitHub 发布区 中的 tar.xz 文件。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[了解一下 HandBrake，这是一个优秀的工具，可以将任何格式的视频转换为目标类型。


本文介绍了它的功能、下载说明和使用指南。

HandBrake

在这个社交媒体的时代，我们身处各种视频之中，当然还有随之而来的各种格式。因此，如果你是在 Linux 平台，甚至是在 Windows 平台，你可以使用各种软件来为多个平台转换各种视频。但是，如果你需要一个简单但功能丰富的视频转换器来处理来自多个来源的所有视频格式，请尝试 HandBrake。

功能

HandBrake 有大量的选项，使其成为一个独特的工具。首先，其工作流程是超级简单。事实上，它只是三个步骤：


选择一个视频

选择一个目标格式

转换


正如你所看到的，如果你是一个新手用户，使用这个工具是非常容易的，因为目标格式的属性（如比特率、尺寸）是基于默认的预设。

其次，如果你想进行高级编辑，如在转换时从字幕文件中添加字幕，也可以使用这个工具。

此外，你还可以改变尺寸、翻转视频、改变分辨率、修改长宽比，以及裁剪。此外，通过一套基本的过滤器配置，可以完成诸如去噪和锐化等操作。

另外，为你的视频文件添加章节、标签和音轨也很容易。

也许 HandBrake 的重要功能是提供预设，以满足现代社会媒体和流媒体的需求。例如，其预设与这些流媒体平台和流媒体设备相一致，如：


Discord

GMail

Vimeo

亚马逊 Fire Stick 电视棒

苹果设备

Chromecast

Playstation

Roku

Xbox


一个相当令人印象深刻的列表，不是吗？不仅如此，如果你是一个专业工作者，它可以帮助你定义和创建转换队列。队列功能允许你在工作流程中批量转换多个视频文件。

最后，你可以转换为 MPEG-4（mp4）、Matroska（mkv）和 WebM 格式。



下载和安装

下载和安装 HandBrake 对于任何平台（Linux、Mac 和 Windows）都很容易。开发者直接提供了可执行文件，可以免费下载。

由于本站的主要目标受众是 Linux 用户，我们将讨论 HandBrake 在 Linux 中的安装。

对于 Ubuntu、Linux Mint 和所有其他发行版，最好的方法是 Flatpak。你可以 设置 Flatpak，然后点击下面的按钮来安装 HandBrake：


通过 Flathub 安装 HandBrake


对于 Windows、macOS 的安装程序，请访问 这个页面。

一个有趣的特点是，你可以通过命令行使用这个应用程序！这意味着你可以使用命令行工具进一步定制你的工作流程，你可以在 这里 下载。

如何使用 HandBrake 来转换视频？（示例）

既然你安装了它，让我们看看你如何只用三个步骤就能转换一个示例视频。


打开 HandBrake，点击顶部工具栏上的 “打开源文件Open Source” 按钮，选择你的视频文件。

现在，从“格式Format”下拉菜单中选择目标文件类型。确保选中目标文件夹（默认为 Videos）。

最后，点击顶部工具栏的“开始Start”按钮，用 HandBrake 转换视频。




你可以在窗口的底部找到一个漂亮的转换进度显示。



上面的步骤是最基本的步骤。如果你想进一步控制视频，你可以改变选项，也可以从我前面解释的大量预设列表中选择。

常见问题

HandBrake 是免费使用么？

是的，它是一个自由开源的应用程序，你可以免费下载它。

它可在 Mac 和 Windows 上用么？

是的，你可以在 macOS、Windows 10 和 Windows 11 中轻松安装 HandBrake。

如何下载 HandBrake？

你只能从官方网站 https://handbrake.fr/ ，不能从其他地方下载 HandBrake。

结束语

Handbrake 是如今可用的专业级免费和开源视频编码器之一。它是一个经过时间考验的应用，每天有数百万用户使用。我希望本指南能帮助你了解这个神奇的工具，让你开始你的视频项目。

英国媒体人、作家基斯·科尔克霍恩（Keith Colquhoun）、安·罗（Ann Wroe）合著的《讣告》（原书名Book of Obituaries，The Economist Newspaper Ltd. 2008；徐龙华译，新星出版社，2022年1月）是一部相当独特的媒体著作。1843年9月由詹姆士·威尔逊创办的《经济学人》（The Economist）是英国一份著名的新闻周报，它的社论持有古典自由主义与经济自由主义的基本立场，倾向于支持自由贸易、全球化、人口自由流动和社会自由主义。从1995年开始，《经济学人》开设了题为“讣告”（The Obituaries）的专栏，这部《讣告》的文章就选自这个专栏。在网上看到介绍这部书的一篇文章的题目是：“写一篇讣告，纪念再也看不到春天的他们和它们”，马上想到的是在近三年来的疫情中逝去的那些人，那些小狗狗，那些再也看不到春天的他（她）们与它们；想到曾经看过的那些令人泪目的前赴后继的名单，想到时代欠逝者一份讣告。当然，《讣告》里有好人也有坏人，但是那些坏人最坏的地方也正是使好人“再也看不到春天”。中文出版物大多把这个专栏名称“The Obituaries”译为“讣告”，偶尔也看到有译作“逝者”。从这些短文的内容和“讣告”作为一种体裁通常给人的感觉来看，“逝者”显得更合适；但是，这些《讣告》的作者写作原意中就有文体造反、以《讣告》的机智幽默反讣告固态的自由精神，那就还是“讣告”吧。

作为《经济学人》每周的最后一篇专栏文章，只有一百三十二行，千字左右，纯粹出自作者的个体视角。相对于逝者几十年生命史中的人和事及其背后的历史语境，这样的专栏只是一块切片，一个被聚焦…]]></summary>

吕思勉先生并不以诗名为后世所称，不过其在晚年自述中曾回忆过一生的文学爱好：“予于文学，天分颇佳。生平并无师承，皆读书而自之。文初宗桐城，后颇思突破之，专学先秦两汉，所作亦能偶至其境。少好宋诗，中年后亦好唐诗，但无功力，下笔仍是宋人境界耳。词所造甚浅，亦宗常州而薄浙派。要之，予可谓古典文学之正统派。予于文学，未尝用功，然嗜好颇笃。”（吕思勉：《三反及思想改造学习总结》）在《吕思勉全集》最后一卷的《蒿庐诗稿》中，收录诗作近百首，其中早年部分以同诗友结社所作的“社作”数量较多，因此吕氏称得上是一位名副其实的“文学青年”。

吕先生爱好文学，尤其是诗词方面，与其成长环境极有关系。父母、长姊皆能诗，其在为父亲所撰行述中称：“府君……上自经史词章之学，旁逮医卜星相之属，靡不淹贯。……姊幼承庭训，能传府君之学，工诗词，善绘事，尤熟精掌故。”同时吕氏在少年时期十分留心亲族、师友的诗词创作，喜爱的诗句皆保留在日记中，其中如父亲、姨父管凌云、舅父程均甫、族兄吕景端、表兄管达如等，另有多位常州女诗人（伯祖母袁太夫人、大姑母、长姊吕颂宜等），皆其亲族。吕氏早年诗词的天赋，可以通过舅父程均甫与乃父的通信稍见端倪：“（吕思勉）所填词，前九首笔情郎畅，虽声律欠谐，而颇近苏辛规格；后十六首细腻风光，情深幽折，渐入秦柳周史间，为阳湖时的派。然绵邈易流于甜俗，往往入于元曲，清刚则日进高洁，不难上溯风诗。若得汉魏乐府意境，出之以白石风神，玉田声韵，庶几于梁溪、阳湖、皋邮诸派中，别开生面也。”（李永圻、张耕华编：《吕思勉先生年谱长编》上，上海古籍出版社，2012年，75页）

关于诗作的情况，吕氏晚年回忆称：“予少好为诗，有所作皆书日记中。倭寇入犯，所居成瓦砾，日记存者无几，诗亦所失过半矣。”（吕思勉：《汪叔良〈茹荼室诗〉序》）而…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[To start with, until a few days ago I was using an RTX 3090 on linux. I could have used wayland but it was not an ideal experience, and I assumed that was because of being on propriety drivers.
 So I went out and bought a fresh 6900xt and installed that, thinking "great, off we go to wayland".
 Here is what I have struggled with for the last 48 or so hours with a fresh endeavour OS install.
  
vscode doesn't run in wayland at all, or sometimes it does but the window is graphically frozen unless I move it to another display/change window size. It will then update one frame and stop again.
 This used to be an old github issue which was fixed and closed a few months ago, but it's back again.
 Most 'wayland' terminals I have installed are blurring on fractional scaling. How/why if they are wayland apps? e.g. kitty looks like poop on fractional scale.
 All xwayland apps scale horribly with fractional scaling/look blurry. I don't know if this is an elitist thing ("lol just install wayland apps noob") but most popular linux apps are on electron, and thus, xwayland. 
 Trying to force certain electron apps (that support the flag) to run in wayland sometimes crashes my desktop and logs me out (sway and hyprland)
 Why do I need to keep telling apps to use wayland when I am in wayland, at all? why isn't this automatic? 
 Screen recording.
 Gaming. Please no "lol this is linux no gaming". See steam deck.
  
It feels like wayland is just a more bare metal version of mutter for gnome that tells everyone "don't worry, you can all use wayland" but, not really.
 I had a look around for any help for geting xwayland apps to scale better but... nothing. I would even settle for mac OS style scaling (scale up double then multple of resolution down).
 Anyway, let me know if I am missing any magic tricks to make the above work.

 There are so many terms that I still just feel strange saying to this day. I believe they must be industry standard, but the terminology seems exceptionally strange to me. Plus when working from home I feel ridiculous saying phrases like “run a cronjob” or “update the kernel” in front of family members who have no idea what that stuff means and it just sounds so weird. 
 Kernel… core dump… cronjob… BASH… YUM… grep… 
 Is it just me, or is Linux terminology especially esoteric?

One of them was a surprisingly unpatched Nintendo Switch. According to some posts about L4T Ubuntu, it has full support for Nvidia Tegra CPU and even has its own drivers made for Switch.
 So, can you use the Switch as an ordinary laptop? For LibreOffice, gimp, youtube videos, even some light games like Supertux, or would it be able to run games like Far Cry 2, or Mafia I? Can I use the keyboard and mouse as well? Thanks for the replies!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I needed to setup my Brother scanner on my machine for the first time today and it was a fun ride. The official instructions are basically "download this shell script which works only on debian (based) and red hat (based), run it with root privileges, English and Chinese only, after that, run these commands without any kind of explanation and hope they work".
 I just resorted to the Scanner page in the Arch wiki, and followed the documented instructions there which were still a tad confusing to me, because Brother in their infinite wisdom decided to have 4 different scanner tools, which all support different but overlapping scanners. The whole thing was pretty much a terminal only experience, which I personally don't mind, but was a huge contrast to the basically one-click install for printers that I've gotten used to.
 Any experiences you wanna share? Specific brands/companies to avoid?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Compiler link: https://github.com/c3lang/c3c
Docs: http://www.c3-lang.org
This is my follow-up "Show HN" from roughly a year ago (https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=27876570). Since then the language design has evolved and the compiler has gotten much more solid.
Assorted extra info:
- The C3 name is a homage to the C2 language project (http://c2lang.org) which it was originally inspired by.
- Although C3 mostly conforms to C syntax, the most obvious change is requiring `fn` in front of the functions. This is to simplify searching for definitions in editors.
- There is a comparison with some other languages here: http://www.c3-lang.org/compare/
- The parts in C3 which breaks C semantics or syntax: http://www.c3-lang.org/changesfromc/
- Aside from the very C-like syntax, one the biggest difference between C3 and other "C competitors" is that C3 prioritizes C ABI compatibility, so that all C3 special types (such as slices and optionals) can be used from C without any effort. C and C3 can coexist nicely in a code base.
- Currently the standard library is not even alpha quality, it's actively being built, but there is a `libc` module which allows accessing all of libc. Raylib is available to use from C3 with MacOS and Windows, see: https://github.com/c3lang/vendor
- There is a blog with assorted articles I've written during the development: https://c3.handmade.network/blog

Hello saves you time by synthesizing clear explanations to technical questions along with code snippets from the web, showing them right on the search page.
We’ve found that most technical searches fall into a few categories: ad-hoc how-tos, understanding an API, recalling forgotten details, research, or troubleshooting. Google is too broad and shallow of a search tool to be good at this. Even after sifting through the deluge of spammy, irrelevant sites pumped full of SEO, you still have to manually find your answer through discussion boards or documentation. Their “featured snippet” approach works for simple factoid queries but quickly falls apart…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, OP here. A friend was involved in a custody battle and was afraid his ex was going to leak all of his discovery documents on the internet and he asked if there was something I could do to make it harder for bots/crawlers to find sensitive information. Originally I was going to turn all of his docs to image based PDFs, but those get large fast and are easy to OCR.
So I found a post musing about altering fonts/glyphs so that it looks like english, but the actual character being seen by the pdf reader is a non-english character. As such, when you try to OCR these files, it doesn't see any images and can't convert it.
I figured it had some potential uses and maybe you fine folks can identify other use cases. I'll be monitoring this post most of the day.

        <id>https://www.williamlong.info/archives/6854.html</id>
        <link href="https://www.williamlong.info/archives/6854.html"/>
        <updated>2022-07-06T13:42:11.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[近年来，国家越来越重视对知识产权的保护，这原本利国利民的举措，却被某些游走在灰色地带的公司作为无节操“碰瓷维权”的借口。据悉，这些公司给每位被告人寄发的“民事起诉状”几乎出自同一模板，批量“生产”。一张图片，要求赔偿侵权金额7000元+3000元律师费，共计10000元。
　　据了解，目前市场上一张付费图片的价格在200元到800元之间，一张用作杂志封面的图片卖到1000元。但是，在多份裁判文书中，这些公司要求单张照片的赔偿金额为6000元到1万元。
　　这种以钓鱼、碰瓷、设置陷阱、恶意诉讼等强买强卖手段谋取不正当利益，浪费应诉人人力、时间资源，占用法院诉讼资源、人力和时间资源的行为，应该受到道德的谴责和法律的制裁。
　　如果公司遇到这种诉讼，交给公司法务部处理。
　　如果个人自媒体作者遇到这种恶意诉讼，下面介绍一些基本的应对方法。
　　1、验证基本情况
　　收到相关资料后，第一时间进行验证，不管图片是否侵权，第一时间将目标图片或页面删除。这么做的原因是，降低侵权的诉讼动机，如果真的是维权，主要目的应该是删除侵权信息，此外，如果诉讼方没有对网页进行公证，删除后对方将无法提供侵权的法律证据。
　　2、不要和解，坚持法院诉讼
　　这类“碰瓷维权”公司的业务基本是依靠和解费用和胜诉费用来赚钱的，通常情况下，大部分公司会怕麻烦，直接选择和解，并支付相关费用，对于个人自媒体来说，不要怕麻烦，坚决不和解，坚持法庭诉讼，通常情况下，这种公司采用的是“广撒网，多敛鱼，择优而从之”，如果人人都和其法庭打官司，每天的开庭的数量将是一个庞大的数字，公司律师成本将会指数型提高，因此不得不放弃大量案件，因此，对于个人来说，坚持到最后，对方往往就直接撤诉了。
　　3、法庭答辩
　　法庭上答辩可以根据几个方面进行：
　　侵权证据，侵权证据应当由原告提交，被告不承担举证责任，所有证据，一律要求原告进行公证，提高原告诉讼成本。
　　避风港原则，对于提供网络平台的网络服务商，可以通过避风港原则进行答辩，“避风港”原则是指在发生着作权侵权案件时，当网络服务提供商只提供空间服务，并不制作网页内容，如果网络服务提供商被告知侵权，则有删除的义务，否则就被视为侵权。 如果侵权内容既不在网络服务提供商的服务器上存储，又没有被告知哪些内容应该删除，则不承担侵权责任。
　　费用问题，表示不认可对方的价格，只能认可市场价格，一般市场价格可能不到300元。对于律师费，可以表示案情简单，不需要支付高额律师费，如果对方没有提供代理合同以及律师费发票，并没有支付律师费用。所以，维权成本的主张并不存在。
　　总而言之，这些所谓的图文公司，就是利用法律的空子来碰瓷。这类公司的目的就是赚取客户赔偿，敲诈勒索。因此，这是个生意对他来说，金钱是第一位的，所以，千万不能和解，让这个公司花费很多时间和精力，知难而退。
　　附录：应诉答辩书样例
　　应诉答辩书
　　（1） 原告是否有权主张权利
　　原告必须拥有着作权和肖像使用授权，才有权利来发起诉讼。鉴于原告未提供相关的证明文件，本着谁主张谁举证的原则，原告应该进行补充证据。
　　以下为详细阐述：
　　关于本案，原告提供的举证北京版权局提供的作品登记证书并不能完全证明原告有权发起诉讼。
　　根据《作品自愿登记试行办法》第二条规定：“作品实行自愿登记。作品不论是否登记，作者或其他着作权人依法取得的着作权不受影响”。作品登记证只能证明原告只是做了登记的这个过程，并不能表示他是着作权人和拥有肖像权使用权。按照法律逻辑，我司也可宣布拥有图片作品版权，只是未作登记；所以，只是根据作品登记证书来证明权属存在法律漏洞。
　　同时，此次涉嫌侵权图片简单通过百度搜索就发现有其他网络图片销售平台拥有此图片版权销售（可参考涉嫌侵权图片搜索截屏）；可佐证原告未必拥有专有版权，本着遵循最高法严格审查照片作品权利归属的态度，建议本案受理法官应该对于作品权利进行再审核。
　　如原告诉状所陈述，原告是中国顶尖的图片生产商，是国内主要图片销售平台的核心供应商，同时也拥有作品登记证书，原告应提供以下文件来支持主张权利：
　　1、 摄影师的身份证明文件或者图片作者的证明文件（需作者签名）2、 图片作品归属证明文件
　　3、 肖像权授权使用协议（有效期内）
　　4、 图片的原始胶片或原始数字文件
　　5、 照片作品独创性及创造过程证明文件
　　6、 作品完成时间，并说明是否独立完成证明文件（以上只为部分《作品自愿登记试行办法》图片申请登记的流程文件）
　　（2）被告是否侵权
　　原告必须拥有着作权和肖像使用授权，才有权利来发起诉讼。鉴于原告未提供相关的证明文件，本着谁主张谁举证的原则，原告应该进行补充证据。
　　被告图片和原告的图片是否是同一张图片，需要原告出示一份有法律效力的图片一致性鉴定证书。]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[微软 Xbox Cloud 串流针对 Linux 降低画质

微软的云游戏串流服务 Xbox Cloud 本应该是平台无关的，也就是在带宽没有变化的情况下它应该向玩家提供相同的画质。但一位玩家注意到在 Linux 下访问 Xbox Cloud 画质显著低于 Windows。他随后尝试用使用扩展将 Linux 上的用户代理伪装成 Windows 上的浏览器，结果画质有了明显提升。


消息来源：Solidot



老王点评：难道 Linux 用户不值得高清画质吗？




systemd 创建者离开了红帽

据消息，systemd 的主要开发者 Lennart Poettering 已经离开了红帽公司，除了著名的 systemd，他还领导了 PulseAudio 和 Avahi 的创建，并且一直是一个多产的自由软件贡献者。此消息还未得到红帽的公开宣布，但他的红帽账户已被禁用，他创建了一个个人的红帽 Bugzilla 账户用于之后的贡献。当然，他仍然活跃在 systemd 领域，今天还做了新的提交。


消息来源：Phoronix



老王点评：虽然有很多人讨厌 systemd，但几乎所有的主流 Linux 发行版都采用 systemd，说明它还是很优秀的。期待离开红帽后 Lennart 继续做出更多贡献！




NIST 公布首批四种抗量子的加密算法

美国国家标准与技术研究所（NIST）宣布了用于标准加密的一种算法，以及用于数字签名的三种算法，并且这三种签名算法各有不同，有的用于较短密钥，有的使用了不同数学技术。而公钥加密算法还未决定，尚在四个算法中选择。当然，关于这些算法，密码学家们还有很多争论。


消息来源：NIST



老王点评：似乎还没有其它机构公开相关的进展，看起来 NIST 成了后量子密码学巨头之战的赢家。]]></summary>

        <updated>2022-07-06T07:52:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[你可能已经知道如何在 Linux 中获得你的系统的 IP 地址。

但是你怎么知道你的路由器的 IP 地址呢？

我说的不是你可以通过连接到 “Show My IP” 这样的网站或简单地在 DuckDuckGo 中 搜索“what is my ip” 获得的公网 IP。

我说的是默认网关 IP，你的 Linux 桌面所连接的地址。

你为什么需要它？嗯，如果你需要改变你的 Wi-Fi/网络的 SSID、密码或其他配置，你必须连接到它。简单的方法是在网页浏览器中输入路由器的 IP 地址，然后使用路由器的用户名和密码。

虽然我不能帮助你获得路由器的用户名和密码，但我肯定可以告诉你如何获得它的 IP。

一如既往，我将展示 GUI 和命令行两种方法。

方法 1：在 Linux 中使用 GUI 获取路由器的 IP 地址

这其实很简单。我在这里使用的是 Ubuntu 的 GNOME 桌面。如果你使用一些 其他桌面环境，截图可能会有所不同。

打开“系统设置System Settings”：



现在进入 Wi-Fi 或“网络Network”（如果你使用的是有线的以太网连接）。在这里，点击你当前使用的网络旁边的小设置符号。



它将打开一个新窗口，里面有关于你的连接的一些细节，如 IP 地址、DNS 和 Mac 地址。你还可以在“安全security”标签下看到 保存的 Wi-Fi 密码。

你还会看到一个名为“默认路由Default Route”的条目。这就是你要找的东西。你的路由器的 IP 地址。



你的系统和网络上的所有其他设备都使用这个 IP 地址连接到路由器。这就是大多数家庭的设置。

现在我已经展示了 GUI 的方法，让我们去看看终端的路线。

方法 2：在 Linux 命令行中获取路由器的 IP 地址

打开一个终端，使用以下命令：

ip route


它将显示几个条目。

~$ ip route
default via 192.168.1.1 dev wlp0s20f3 proto dhcp metric 600 
169.254.0.0/16 dev wlp0s20f3 scope link metric 1000 
192.168.1.0/24 dev wlp0s20f3 proto kernel scope link src 192.168.1.34 metric 600


第一行，以 default via 开头，给出了你网关的 IP。这是你的路由器的 IP 地址。



你可以看到，192.168.1.1 是我的路由器的 IP 地址。通常情况下，路由器的 IP 地址是子网的第一个数字。然而，这并不是一个硬性规定。我也见过有 x.y.z.30 地址的路由器。

额外技巧

正如 Samir 在评论中所分享的，你也可以（在 Debian 上）使用 ping 命令来获得网关 IP：

ping _gateway




以防你不知道，你必须 在 Linux 中使用 Ctrl+C 来停止一个正在运行的命令。

我希望你在需要的时候能发现这个技巧是有用的。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[“星际战机”是星空实验室即将推出的一款 Linux 笔记本电脑。他们正在最后确定生产细节，同时透露了一些关键的亮点。




我们已经有许多来自星空实验室、TUXEDO 等制造商的 Linux 专用笔记本电脑。

然而，其中只有少数几家专注于提供一个超棒的显示屏。

例如，TUXEDO 的 Infinitybook Pro 14 带有 3K 显示屏，而且，该笔记本电脑确实不错。

现在，看起来 星空实验室 将为其即将推出的 “星际战机” 笔记本电脑配备 15.6 英寸 4K 显示屏。他们在 推特 上分享了初步信息，提到他们正在敲定生产细节。

关于星际战机我们目前所知道的情况

这款笔记本电脑将采用 45W 供电的英特尔 / AMD 处理器，它将有英特尔 / AMD 两种变体可用。

你还将可以选择高达 64GB 的内存和 2TB 的存储。可以说，对于那些想为自己的 Linux 笔记本电脑提高规格的用户来说，这应该是一个强大的机器。

当然，它的关键亮点是显示屏。它将采用 4K 10 位哑光 IPS 显示屏。

该公司提到，该显示屏的成本要高于其 StarLite 笔记本电脑。

但是，这会是一个有吸引力的产品吗？许多采用高分辨率显示屏或 OLED 面板的笔记本电脑在电池时长方面表现不佳。不仅仅是 Linux 笔记本电脑。

那么，“星际战机”会成为该领域的一个有竞争力的竞争者吗？

星空实验室在一条推文中提到，他们估计电池时长约为 8-14 小时，这取决于配置。当然，这也取决于你的使用情况。

该公司还澄清说，这款笔记本电脑可以使用 Coreboot，但它不会是一个完全采用自由软件的项目。其他一些值得注意的地方还有：


该笔记本电脑将具有 LVFS 支持。

英特尔型号将提供第 4 代固态硬盘。AMD 型号将只限于第 3 代固态硬盘。


如图片所示，它可能安装了 elementaryOS 6.1。然而，你也可以预期它提供 Ubuntu 22.04 LTS。

那么，你对星空实验室的这架“星际战机”有何看法？当它上市时，这将是你的下一台笔记本电脑吗？

在下面的评论区分享你的想法。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[GNOME Web 正在打磨成一个完美的 Linux 浏览器。你认同吗？




GNOME Web（Epiphany）是 可供 Linux 用户使用的最佳浏览器 之一。

它提供了简约且独特的用户体验。

不幸的是，这种独特性并没有激励用户把它作为主力网页浏览器。

但是，看起来这种情况很快就会改变……

根据其中一位开发者（Patrick，网名 TingPing）透露，GNOME Web 终于添加了对 WebExtensions 的支持。

它将会是 GNOME 43 新功能的一部分。

带有 WebExtensions 的 GNOME Web



一个浏览器，外观简约，还支持扩展，夫复何求啊！

我不知道你怎么想，但我对于 GNOME Web 不支持扩展这件事，一直耿耿于怀。

所以，这个消息真的让我很兴奋！

目前，这只是对 Epiphany 43.alpha 版本的实验性支持。因此，你只能使用 GNOME Web 的 beta/alpha 构建来测试它。

开发者提到：


Epiphany 43.alpha 支持上述的基本结构。我们目前正在根据 Firefox 的 ManifestV2 API 来建模行为，同时也尽可能与 Chrome 扩展程序保持兼容。未来，我们计划在保留 V2 的同时，支持 ManifestV3。


你必须在终端中显式启用扩展支持，然后下载、添加扩展的 .xpi 文件，以安装浏览器扩展。

你需要访问 Mozilla 的 Firefox 附加组件门户网站 来获得扩展程序。



你可以安装 Epiphany（GNOME Web）的最新开发版本，并使用以下命令启用扩展：

flatpak remote-add --if-not-exists gnome-nightly https://nightly.gnome.org/gnome-nightly.flatpakrepo
flatpak install gnome-nightly org.gnome.Epiphany.Devel
flatpak run --command=gsettings org.gnome.Epiphany.Devel set org.gnome.Epiphany.web:/org/gnome/epiphany/web/ enable-webextensions true


请注意，它仍在活跃开发中，可能无法按预期工作。在第一次尝试时，你可能需要密切关注终端是否有错误，如果有的话，要先解决它才行。

如果你想了解更多技术细节，你可以阅读 TingPing 的博文。

你的下一个主力浏览器？

与 Linux 上的基于 Firefox 和 Chrome/Chromium 的浏览器相比，GNOME Web 是一个的完全独特的替代品。（LCTT 译注：GNOME Web 基于 WebKit 引擎。）

那么，随着即将推出的扩展支持，你愿意尝试将 GNOME Web 作为你的主力浏览器吗？

你如何看待 GNOME Web（或 Epiphany）中的改进呢？请在下方评论区中告诉我们吧！

 来源：澎湃新闻
                

《法国大革命批判辞典》（五卷，已出三卷）, [法]弗朗索瓦•孚雷、莫娜•奥祖夫主编，刘景迪、顾杭、庞冠群、申华明、张智、黄艳红、洪庆明译，刘北成校，商务印书馆2022年2月出版
《法国大革命批判辞典》（以下简称《批判辞典》）序言中说，在这场革命两百年之后，它在法国人集体记忆中的地位发生了根本性的变化。在1889年和1939年，共和国仍然需要捍卫乃至垄断革命记忆来巩固自身，但当1989年临近时，这种关于革命的共和记忆已经褪色，其原因正在于它已经完成了自己的使命。实际上，在二十世纪末的记忆研究浪潮中，对法国如何纪念1889、1939和1989年三个革命的jubilé（五十年），帕斯卡尔·奥里（Pascal Ory）和帕特里克·加西亚（Patrick Garcia）有专著探讨。他们均认为，1989年的纪念活动，其政治氛围与前两次大为不同，如《批判辞典》所言，共和记忆已经不需要炫耀其战斗式的忠诚了。对这种变化的原因，《批判辞典》的主编者也在全书的序言中作了说明，指出了二战后法国经济、政治和社会等各个层面的深刻变革，在笔者看来，这些变革大致就是社会学家亨利·蒙德拉（Henri Mendras）在《第二次法国大革命》（La seconde Révolution française, 1965-1984）中论述的主要内容。1939年的法国与十九世纪的法国有明显的连续性，但1989年的法国，用《辞典》主编者的话来说，已经不认识1939年的法国了。

1989年的庆典已经看不到官方垄断革命记忆的企图，或许正因为如此，以孚雷为代表的“修正派”革命史学的胜利才得以在各个层面充分展现出来。除了这部《批判辞典》，孚雷、莫娜·奥祖夫和美国学者基思·贝克（Keith M. Baker）主编的《法国大革命与现代政治文化的创…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Just a suggestion, and I don't really have the time to code it right now, but still worth saying because (according to Google) no one has done this before.
 Nvidia has a pretty nifty tool on Windows called Nvidia Broadcast that has an incredibly good noise canceler called RTX Voice (it can even cancel out a goddamn leaf blower). A few people have pointed out that it'd be nice to have on Linux on the Nvidia Forum, and there has been a response from someone at Nvidia a month ago pointing to the API docs for Maxine. It looks like the Maxine Audio SDK can do the same thing as RTX Voice, and it has Linux support according to the docs, and it looks like implementing it isn't that hard. So if I'm not the only one who misses RTX Voice on Linux and you have the time for it, you could make a Pipewire plugin or something that uses that SDK to port RTX Voice on Linux. I might take a go at it in 1-2 months if no one does, but I just don't have time for it right now. Just thought I'd share this here :)

June 8, when Ubuntu published kernel packages containing a particularly
nasty bug that was caused by an Ubuntu-specific
patch to the kernel.  The bug led to a kernel panic whenever a Docker container
was started. Fixed packages were made available on June 10, but there
are questions about what went wrong
with handling the patch; in particular, it is surprising that kernel 5.13,
which has been beyond its end-of-life
for months, made it onto machines running Ubuntu 20.04, which is supposed
to be a long-term support release.]]></summary>

 I am wondering, does anybody else use Linux even if they don't speak any programming languages? Is this unusual?
 I would like to learn to speak a programming language, but for now, I don't. Yet I still use GNU/Linux.
 Is this unusual? Have you ever encountered such a case before? Am I alone? What about you?
 Edit: and is that embarassing? Am I inferior?
 Edit 2: Why are people being hateful and downvoting me

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Debian Linux 9 结束了五年的长期支持

Debian 长期支持团队近日宣布：Debian Linux 9 系列的五年支持周期已经结束。Debian 9 发布于 2017 年 6 月 17 日，当时官方将该版本的 LTS 支持延长到了五年，以供有特定需要的人们使用。Debian Linux 10 是目前支持的旧稳定版本，还有两年维护支持，直到 2024 年 6 月 30 日。而最新的是 Debian Linux 11 。


消息来源：Debian



老王点评：一个纯由社区驱动的发行版都能支持 5 年，并被用在生产环境中，而很多商业公司支持的 Linux 发行版都不敢承诺。




传统数据安全工具大多无法抵御勒索软件攻击

根据最新发布的《数据渗透和勒索状况报告》，虽然超过 70% 的企业拥有一套现有的预防、检测和回溯解决方案，但近 40% 的企业在过去一年中仍然受到了勒索软件攻击。研究结果表明，传统的数据安全工具，如安全备份和恢复工具、提供静态和传输中加密的解决方案、标记化和数据屏蔽等，在 60% 的时间里未能保护企业的数据免受勒索软件威胁。它们的问题不在于它们没有强大的安全措施，而在于攻击者可以通过窃取凭证来实现对关键数据资产的特权访问，从而避开这些控制。


消息来源：Venture Beat



老王点评：可以预见，数据勒索这一攻击方式必然会愈演愈烈。




西数表示硬盘容量依然很重要

西数负责人在采访中谈到了对硬盘市场的看法，他也承认机械硬盘现在没有被出现在 MacBook、Windows 或者 Chromebook 等设备中，在客户端设备中存在感下降，但是放眼数据中心市场，情况就不一样了。在这个领域，闪存存储只占 5-15% 份额，剩余的 85%-95% 存储都是靠机械硬盘，还有一些是磁带设备。IDC 预测全球数据生产量从 2018 年的 33ZB 将增长到 2025 年的 176ZB，企业用户每年的数据容量增长将达到 30%。


消息来源：Next Platform



老王点评：确实，要说可靠性和大容量，还是机械硬盘比较好。但是感觉硬盘容量的增长赶不上数据量的增长速度。]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[微软说他们热爱 Linux 和开源，但我们仍然没有得到对其许多产品的 Linux 原生支持。


虽然他们可能在努力增加更多的支持，比如 可以在 Linux 上安装微软 Edge 浏览器，但对于一个价值几万亿美元的公司来说，这并不出色。

同样，微软的 To-Do 服务也是一个受欢迎的服务，它取代了 2020 年关闭的 Wunderlist。

如果你不知道的话，我们有很多 可用于 Linux 的待办事项列表应用。因此，如果你想脱离微软 To-Do，你有选择。

微软 To-Do 是一个基于云的任务管理应用，让你从手机、桌面和网络组织你的任务。它可以在 Windows、Mac 和 Android 上下载。

那么，如果你不愿意使用网页浏览器而使用一个单独的应用，你在 Linux 上能做什么呢？

Kuro 派上用场了。

Kuro：非官方的开源微软 To-Do 应用



Kuro 是一个非官方的开源应用，它为你提供了微软 To-Do 在 Linux 上的桌面体验和一些额外的功能。

它是 Ao 的一个分叉，Ao 是一个开源项目，逐渐成为它的解决方案。不幸的是，它不再积极维护了。所以，我遇到了一个似乎可以工作的新复刻。



Kuro 提供了一些额外的功能，可以让你在应用中切换主题，启用全局快捷方式等。

请注意，这个应用是相当新的，但有一个稳定版本可以试用。此外，开发者计划在不久的将来增加更多的主题和功能。

Kuro 的功能



如果你倾向于使用微软的服务（如 Outlook），它的 To-Do 应用应该是组织你的任务的一个完美选择。你甚至可以标记电子邮件以创建任务。

使用 Kuro 桌面客户端，你可以得到一些可配置的功能，包括：


能够在启动时启动该程序。

获得一个系统托盘图标，以快速创建一个任务，搜索，或检查当天的可用列表。

启用全局快捷键。

切换可用的主题（深褐色、德古拉、黑色、深色）。

切换自动夜间模式，如果你不想不断改变主题。

隐藏托盘图标，如果你不需要它。

根据需要定制字体大小。




除了一些功能外，你还可以进入某些设置来启用/禁用电子邮件通知、删除前确认等，对待办事项应用体验的进行更多的控制。

总的来说，体验并不糟糕，但我在几分钟内注意到用户界面上有一些奇怪的图形问题。我不确定这是否是一个已知的问题。

在 Linux 中安装 Kuro

你可以从它的 GitHub 发布页面 找到基于 Ubuntu 的发行版的 .deb 包。

此外，你可以从 Snap 商店 中在你选择的任何 Linux 发行版上安装它。该软件包也可在 Arch Linux 发行版的 AUR 中获取。

开发者还提到，正在开发一个 Flatpak 软件包。所以，你可以关注它的 GitHub 页面以了解更多相关信息。

你已经试过它了吗？你知道有什么更好的微软 To-Do 客户端用于 Linux 吗？请在下面的评论中告诉我。

不管你是偶尔使用的用户、学生、老师，还是科学家、开发人员和创意工作者，在工作上你需要各种各样的应用程序。Linux 生态系统有数以千计的应用程序，它们分散在各个角落，几乎可以满足各种需求。而包括 Ubuntu 在内的大多数主流 Linux 发行版，默认都只提供了基本的应用程序。

在这个五篇系列文章的第一篇中，我们列出了一些每个人都用的上的专门应用。

1、GNOME 优化工具

如果你在使用 Ubuntu GNOME 版，GNOME 优化工具GNOME Tweak Tool是你必备的实用工具。使用这个工具来定制你的桌面，你可以改变字体、缩放比例、主题、光标和许多其他选项。默认的设置窗口现在没有列出所有这些选项。

此外，你也能用该应用改变窗口装饰、标题栏、标题栏按钮以及开机启动项。

你可以使用应用商店搜索 “Tweaks” 来安装它，或者通过下列终端的命令来安装：

sudo apt install gnome-tweaks




2、Steam

由于 Valve 公司和相关社区的贡献，在 Linux 上玩游戏不再困难。Steam 是 Valve 公司开发的电子游戏服务的前端平台，你可以通过 Steam 在 Ubuntu 上获取最新的游戏版本。此外，Steam 客户端提供反外挂监测、自动更新，和支持带有流媒体功能的社交对话。

如果你是一个 Linux 游戏玩家，Steam 是常用的客户端，你可以用下面的命令来安装。此外，你可以在应用商店中搜索 “Steam Installer” 并使用 Flatpak 或 Snap 进行安装。

sudo apt install steam




3、Peek

在我看来，Peek 是一款被低估的应用。它是一个…]]></summary>

《夏承焘日记全编》，夏承焘著，浙江古籍出版社，2021年11月版，1680.00元
今年3月，《夏承焘日记全编》新书发布会在杭州举行。皇皇十二巨册记载了夏承焘七十年人生的日记，堪称中国二十世纪最漫长、最完整的学人日记，具有极高的文化价值。媒体对此普遍关注，多家记者相继来采访或约稿，其中也有《文汇报》。我总感觉，《日记全编》是一个大大的文化宝藏，可供人多方寻采，取之不尽，用之不竭；它又像一个万花筒，不同的视角，呈现不同的色彩，不同的景观。于是就想出来一个法子，用“文汇报”三字作检索，看看《日记全编》中会罗列出哪些信息，能从中发现一些什么。这也是这部鸿篇巨制展开的一种有意味的方式。它所展现的，是上世纪五十年代开始的一些日子……

合为时·合为事

“文章合为时而著，歌诗合为事而作”。五十年代到六十年代初，是夏先生在报刊杂志上发表作品的一个高频时段。《文汇报》和《浙江日报》，则是夏先生发表作品最多的两大阵地。这阶段夏先生发表的作品，无论是诗词创作，还是诗词欣赏、评论，多带有鲜明的时代性。

如1958年日记：

《文汇报》载予下乡三诗。（1月17日）

《文汇报》见汤国梨先生和予《下乡》三诗。（1月27日）

原来，章太炎夫人汤国梨在《文汇报》上看到了夏先生的《下乡》诗，受到启发。她写给编辑的信中说：“夏先生是个文学家，竟有三事力能胜任；我虽年老力衰，尚有二事（养蚕、采棉花）可为。”于是同题赓和，也写了三首《下乡》诗投给了《文汇报》。

又如同年日记：

发《文汇报》《浣溪沙·下乡访问农村》词四首。（3月5日）

核查《文汇报》实刊发三首，词题是“春节下乡访问农村，笕桥乡七星社模范饲养员陈祖元同志邀作诗，为成小词三首”。其中一首的上片为：“谁为农家注起居？今年新事古来无，家家元旦动犁锄。”

此外，1956年12月13日…]]></summary>

Is that possible? Maybe getting hashes of all files in /boot and then checking them?

Given how baked into Linux the terminal is I expected a lot more pushback from the community. I got almost none. The most hate I got was when I said I didn't like GNOME and greatly preferred KDE because it's more comfortable to me as a lifelong Windows user. Even had a former member of the KDE team message me about how disabled people with bad hands were an oversight to them, so now they're looking to get into connection with current KDE members to improve non keyboard use. I didn't expect any of that and it's been great to recieve some support rather than just getting "oh you can't use the terminal much? Get gud." That I was expecting. Thanks again, and have a good one

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Someone was asking how to determine the quality of coding practices at places they are interviewing. My mind went on a tangent wondering if it is fair for interviewees to bring a coding exercise for the interviewers to complete. I've heard that interviews are an opportunity for both sides to interview each other? So does the interviewee have an equal opportunity to determine how the interviewers work through problems by presenting their own exercise for the interviewers to complete, and therefore gain insight on the company's practices?
I've never heard of anyone doing this before and I don't think it would be well received. Has anyone done this? For anyone who conducts interviews what would you think if someone did this?

 In my time using Linux, I've used gdm, sddm, and lightdm, all three of which have eventually (or really quickly in some cases) refused to start when booting my PC. It's not really a big deal since I can just use startx instead, but it's just one extra thing to fix when setting up a new install.
 The worst instance of this came yesterday - I had just put a fresh install of Debian 11 on my PC, and told the installer to put KDE on the system as well. I boot up the machine and it hung on "Initializing CUPS". Turns out sddm was the culprit, again. Once I disabled it, I booted straight into a login prompt from which I could startx, and everything worked.
 I had to have a bit of a laugh at something being broken on a fresh install of Debian, of all distros. But it made me curious to see if anybody else has had this sort of issue, or maybe it's just a quirk with my hardware or something.

 I've done some research and the only options I've found so far are:
  
Examining the output of locale or the LANG environment variable.
 Writing a multi-width symbol (one that occupies multiple columns) and comparing the cursor positions before and after.
  
which I have tested and both turned out to be unreliable, especially when Unicode is not supported.
 I'll like to know if there are any reliable ways to go about this.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Over my brief period of using Linux I've seen a few interesting DEs as well as Distros associated with them. However recently I was thinking about the concept of desktop environments and had a weird idea.
 What if the desktop was like a first person video game? where your windows are floating boxes that you can move around. when you install applications, instead of them showing up on a desktop their icons are objects that fall into your virtual room.
 Kind of got the idea from Anarchy Arcade Where the only real difference being that the virtual world is the entire DE or even Distro. For it's application I imagine it would be perfect for VR.
 It's just a thought more than anything. I wanted to hear what people thought of it, if it sounds cool, and maybe inspire some savy coder to make something.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So I am currently researching VR Headsets and one criteria I search by is how well (and if at all) their native SDKs work under Linux.
 Im new to VR and Linux so I dont have a full understanding yet.
 ​
 From my understanding developing an VR app (not games exclusively) requires the SDK of the Headset manufacturer or OpenVR from Valve that apparently supports most Headsets.
 For gaming you would need Unity or Unreal Engine with the SDK Plug provided by the Headset Manufacturer.
 (In case of HP, they apparently dont offer an SDK since MS Mixed Reality doenst have an SDK and you need Vidual Studio)
 ​
 Eg:
 If I want to programm 
 - a simple VR app for the HTC Vive Pro 2 I would need the Viveport SDK.
 - a game in Unity I would need Unity engine plus the Viveport SDK plug in for Unity
 ​
 Now my questions are:
 ​
 How supported and commonly used is Linux when developing VR apps?
 And how well do these SDKs provided by manufacturers work under Linux? (eg Viveport doesnt even list Linux in their system specs)

        <id>https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=31980069</id>
        <link href="https://github.com/trane-project/trane"/>
        <updated>2022-07-04T18:04:26.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi HN,
I released Trane over the weekend: https://github.com/trane-project/trane. Trane is an automated
system for learning complex skills. Think of it like defining a skills tree (technically a graph) of
all the smaller skills you need to master a complex skill and having an automated system to
automatically traverse the graph as you master them.
The seed for Trane was planted after my frustration trying to learn music, and jazz in particular.
There are simply too many things you need to master first (e.g. knowing the names of a note, knowing
where the notes are in your instrument, timing, etc) and it becomes difficult to track what it is
that you should focus on, and there is a process of constant atrophy, even if you practice
consistently.
Trane is an early state, but is already usable. I have released a command line interface at
https://github.com/trane-project/trane-cli and some music courses at
https://github.com/trane-project/trane-music.
I would like to get some ideas in regard to what other skills could be a good fit for Trane. I am
thinking chess, programming, or languages could be a fit. I am wondering if Trane could be applied
to something like learning pure mathematics. I would love to hear any suggestions. Perhaps there's
some of you who have found a similar issue while practicing your own hobbies.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The kernel has thousands of configuration options, many of which can change
the kernel's behavior in subtle or surprising ways.  Among those options is
CONFIG_ANDROID,
which one might expect to be relatively straightforward; its description
reads, in its entirety: "Enable support for various drivers needed on
the Android platform".  It turns out that this option does more than
that, to the surprise of some users.  That has led to a plan to remove this
option, but that has brought a surprise or two of its own — and some
disagreement — as well.]]></summary>

five years after its initial release on June 17, 2017".  There will be further updates for a subset of the packages in the release through the Extended LTS project.  Meanwhile, the LTS team is moving on to Debian 10 ("buster"):

The LTS Team will prepare the transition to Debian 10 buster, which is the
current oldstable release. The LTS team will take over support from the
Security Team during August, while the final point update for buster will
be released during that month.

Debian 10 will also receive Long Term Support for five years after its

　　安装步骤：
　　下载、安装并启动Battle.net应用程序。建立一个Battle.net帐号，或使用已有的帐号登入。
　　开启Battle.net，并允许该应用程式下载任何可用的更新。
　　选择“游戏”>《暗黑破坏神：不朽》，并点击“安装”。在安装完成后，只要点击“进行游戏”即可启动游戏。
　　为了在PC版和移动版《暗黑破坏神：不朽》之间无缝接轨，你必须拥有Battle.net帐号。登入Battle.net后可继续你的进度。由于游戏不支持转换服务器，暴雪基于中文与英文分别列出了亚太地区服务器名单，方便玩家选择服务器加入。
　　官方表示感谢大家的耐心等候，开发团队正努力完善游戏体验与顺畅的服务器，让玩家能在上市当日享受3A级恶魔杀戮体验。《暗黑破坏神：不朽》国服上线时间暂未公开，虽然iOS商店显示游戏将于7月31日上线，但可能只是占位符。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[下一代 GTK 5 可能要放弃 X11 支持

GTK 4 才推出没多久，而下一代的 GTK 5 可能还要很多年，但 GNOME 开发者们已经开始考虑在 GTK 5 剔除对 X11 的后端支持。有开发者认为，X11 迟迟没有变得更好，其开发几乎陷入停顿。而与此同时，Wayland 却已经变得广泛使用，GTK 也早已开始转向以 Wayland 功能为主的 API 设计。当然，开发者的这些讨论仅针对 GTK5，而不影响 GTK4 的更新。


消息来源：Phoronix



老王点评：X11 是 1987 年发布的 X 窗口系统的第 11 个版本，但是目前的参考实现是 10 年前推出的 7.7 版本。它的历史包袱太沉重了，趁早放弃，并让应用都迁移到 Wayland 才是正路。




大学拿回了支付的比特币赎金，发现还赚了

2019 年荷兰一所大学遭到勒索软件攻击，由于备份系统也被锁定了，大学最后同意支付价值 20 万欧元的比特币赎金。荷兰警方在随后的犯罪调查中跟踪到了一个洗钱账号，其中有大约价值 4 万欧元的部分比特币赎金，并在两年后将这些比特币归还给了大学。有趣的是，这些比特币现在已价值 50 万欧元。虽然没有拿回全部的赎金，但归还的比特币价值相比支付的赎金已经翻了一倍多。该大学表示这笔钱将用于帮助经济拮据的学生。


消息来源：DW



老王点评：这算不算是来自勒索攻击者的“被动投资”，就像门头沟事件后，很多人假如即便只能拿回当时的一小部分 BTC 也赚了很多。




Meta 将关闭加密货币项目

Meta（Facebook）的加密货币 Diem（前称 Libra）将于 9 月 1 日停止运作。Facebook 及其盟友是在 2019 年宣布了稳定币项目 Libra，计划在 2020 年推出。但该项目面临了世界各地监管机构的压力，主要盟友陆续退出。负责该加密货币计划的高管在 2021 年离开了公司，相关资产被出售，而 Meta 的兴趣也转向了元宇宙。


消息来源：CNET



老王点评：曾经被视为革命性的 Facebook 加密货币项目，终于走到了终点。有时候你得承认，步子太大也是危险。]]></summary>

Rationality: What It Is, Why It Seems Scarce, Why It Matters, Steven Pinker, Allen Lane, 2021, 432pp
哈佛大学教授、心理学家、作家史蒂芬·平克（Steven Pinker）2021年的新书《理性》（Rationality: What It Is, Why It Seems Scarce, Why It Matters）又是一部字面意义上的左右开弓之作，他试图辩护的核心主旨听起来一如既往的伟大、直白、正确——“我们应当追随理性”（we should follow reason）。近年来，批评平克几乎已经比吹捧平克更显媚俗了。这些批评大体分为两类，一类批评他“过于理性”，另一类批评他不甚理性。如果一定要我在保卫平克和打倒平克之间选择，那当然是选前者，但是我必须得说，我属于他的后一类批评者——他所搭建的那个平行时空里充斥着北美风情的乐观主义味道，仿佛喷多了空气清新剂似的。不过，原因还不止于此。平克对理性的理解有着严重问题。
史蒂芬·平克
《理性》的结构是很清楚的。首先，平克发问，为什么人们明明可以理性却往往不理性呢？其次，他苦口婆心地试图解释，为什么理性好、不理性不好。接下来，他分层次地展开理性有哪些内涵、人们可能在哪些问题上犯错，再回过头来讨论当今的（美国）人究竟是出了什么毛病，最后以“理性就是好来就是好”收尾。而《理性》的缺陷也是很清楚的。首先，平克没讲清楚理性是什么。其次，他也没说明白理性为什么好。再次，平克对现实中的不理性的诊断，本身就是不理性的。至于具体论述的漏洞百出，都还只是小节。最关键的是，平克急切地想要解决一些问题，却没有意识到自己提出了错误的问题。

尽管平克在《…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[代码生成器是非常有用的工具。我有时使用 jinja2 的命令行版本来生成高度冗余的配置文件和其他文本文件，但它在转换数据方面功能有限。显然，Jinja2 的作者有不同的想法，而我想要类似于 列表推导list comprehensions 或 D 语言的 可组合范围composable range 算法之类的东西。

我决定制作一个类似于 Jinja2 的工具，但让我可以通过使用范围算法转换数据来生成复杂的文件。这个想法非常简单：一个直接用 D 语言代码重写的模板语言。因为它 就是 D 语言，它可以支持 D 语言所能做的一切。我想要一个独立的代码生成器，但是由于 D 语言的 mixin 特性，同样的模板语言可以作为嵌入式模板语言工作（例如，Web 应用程序中的 HTML）。有关该技巧的更多信息，请参阅 这篇 关于在编译时使用 mixins 将 Brainfuck 转换为 D 和机器代码的文章。

像往常一样，源码在 GitLab 上。这篇文章中的例子也可以在这里找到。

Hello world 示例

这是一个演示这个想法的例子：

Hello [= retro("dlrow") ]!
[: enum one = 1; :]
1 + 1 = [= one + one ]


[= some_expression ] 类似于 Jinja2 中的 {{ some_expression }}，它在输出中呈现一个值。[: some_statement; :] 类似于 {% some_statement %} ，用于执行完整的代码语句。我更改了语法，因为 D 也大量使用花括号，并且将两者混合使模板难以阅读（还有一些特殊的非 D 指令，比如 include，它们被包裹在 [< 和 >] 中）。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There are some distributions which have a mechanism for creating live ISOs with persistent storage from a non-ISO partition on the same media, but it's distro-specific, and many distros do not have it. I wanted a distro-agnostic method to add /home persistence, and did not find much info about this. So I wrote a guide, in case it's helpful for anyone else.
 This is what I came up with ad-hoc, so there may be better methods. It has, however, worked on a range of different distros, some of which were not debian based.
 This method doubles as a way to customize live ISOs for your own needs, such as adding new files, or edit existing configuration files in /etc.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[GNOME 文件即将到来的变化改善了用户体验，让我们来看看其中的一些变化。




我们离 GNOME 43 的发布还有几个月的时间，但是 GNOME 应用程序的开发活动正在如火如荼地进行。

例如，GNOME Web 43 alpha 版本支持了扩展。

同样，GNOME 文件管理器（Nautilus）也有一些令人兴奋的变化，特别是对于列表视图。

列表视图使用 GtkColumnView 部件重新实现，丢弃了 GtkTreeView，以便能够添加新功能。

一些完善了代码的变化包括：

1、拖动并选择文件

就像你在网格视图中通常所做的那样，你终于可以通过简单地拖动你的鼠标在列表视图中选择多个项目，来选择你想要的项目。



如果你没有注意到，每行之间也有一点间隔。虽然选择的动画还不是最流畅的，但它是一个正在进行的工作。

我试着用 peek 录制 GIF（在带有 Wayland 的 Fedora 上），但由于某些原因，它没有反应，可能与 alpha 版本有一些冲突。

2、鼠标悬停时高亮行

当你把鼠标悬停在上面的时候，没有行高亮是很不直观的。

现在，它做到了。只要把你的光标放在列表视图中的任何一个项目上，它就会被突出显示，如上图所示。

3、搜索一个文件时，列不会消失





当你用当前的 Nautilus 文件管理器搜索一个文件时，列的处理方式不是很好。你会失去某些细节信息，如文件大小。

在新的变化中，你仍然可以看到文件的大小、修改日期，以及给文件加星的能力。

通过这一改变，用户体验肯定会更好。

4、更好的紧凑视图

当你缩小文件管理器窗口的大小时，也处理的不是很好。你看不到文件扩展名的细节，而且列对变化没有反应。



在 GNOME 文件管理器 43 alpha 版本中，即使你缩小了窗口的大小以获得一个紧凑的视图，你仍然可以看到列，以及如上所示的文件扩展名。

5、新的文件上下文菜单



作为对 2022 年 GSoC（谷歌编程之夏）的贡献的一部分，一位开发者正专注于改善新文档功能的可发现性。

当你将某些文件添加到模板Templates目录中时，你可以在执行右键单击时在上下文菜单中找到这个 “新文档New Document” 选项。

在即将到来的更新中，这个选项将是开箱即用。即，更加易于使用。

另外，开发人员正在想办法改进添加模板的过程。你可以这篇在 博文 中更多了解他们的工作。

6、当你给一个文件加星时的动画



当你点击列表项右侧的星形图标时，你可以发现它在移动，让你知道你与该选项进行了互动。

总结

当然，我所提到的一切都处于开发阶段（alpha 版本）。在我们等待 beta 版本的时候，我们应该能清楚地了解到文件管理器的更多功能，以及事情是如何改进的。

你对 GNOME 43 有什么期待？请在下面的评论中告诉我们。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[You need drivers to communicate with pci card, or external devices.
 Usually, drivers are developed for windows. 
 But because you can emulate windows on linux with qemu. 
 Let's say for example an external device plugged into usb to the host machine (running linux)
 The host machine running linux doesn't have the driver to communicate with this device. But this driver exists on Windows.
 Would it be possible for the host machine to redirect the usb IO signaling to/from the emulated usb port of the emulated windows (running in qemu). So it's windows having the driver which actually do the computing to communicate with this device.
 ​
 ​
 Even if of course it would be slower, would it be theoretically possible. And if no why?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Greetings, travelers.
 I am occasionally annoyed by the limitations of terminals: <esc> delays due to escape character mechanism, character grid graphical limitation, unusable keymaps (can't think of any off the top, but some keys with mods send the same code or are reserved by the terminal for an ancient reason), etc.
 I briefly used a graphical client for neovim. It was shocking to not have these problems. Scrolling was smooth. Graphics were nice. No <esc> delay, so everything felt responsive. I didn't try, but I'm sure I could have mapped practically any modifer+key combo I wanted.
 I know about some workarounds like reducing timeoutlen for <esc>, but these are not perfect solutions.
 I love the terminal for it's versatility and power, so I will not abandon it for a mouse-driven GUI workflow. I use tools like tmux, lf, neovim, ripgrep, and fd daily. I sleep with my hands on my keyboard, and my mouse(pad) is lava.
 Is there a significant way forward here without losing what I love? Would writing my own terminal get me where I want, or are there deeper sources of these limitations? I know nothing about tty except in using ctrl+alt+f_ to swap shells if something goes wrong on boot/login.
 Thanks,
 A friend

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi everybody. I have been a Linux system administrator for about 30 years now. Recently I got into a car accident and I have lost the use of my right arm for a period of time, maybe forever. I am discovering the joys of speech to text on my Mac, which does pretty well. However this is English language speech to text, not Linux commands speech to text. And certainly not VIM speech to text lol. Anyway forgive me for the low effort post (I did not do any searching) but what I was wanting to know is if there are any speech to text systems that are really geared towards typing out a bunch of Linux commands and what not. You know what I mean? Linux systems administration involves dashes and capital letters and all sorts of weird commands… Asterisks and all sorts of punctuation. I anticipate normal speech to text will have a hard time with all that, and I won't end up saving any time over just typing one-handed. Truth be told, I haven't actually tried the normal Mac speech to text because I don't think I am quite ready to go back to work. I just thought I'd ask a preemptive question to see if there are any recommendations that you guys have. As always, thanks for any help you can provide.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Google表示，已通过Safe Browsing服务封锁了遭到黑客租赁服务所利用的数十个域名，并公布黑客租赁服务的生态。Google的威胁分析小组（Threat Analysis Group，TAG）不仅长期追踪位于全球的逾30家商业黑客公司，亦密切观察日益茁壮的黑客租赁（hack-for-hire）服务。
　　前者主要销售黑客工具或能力予客户，并由客户自行操作，而后者则是直接代客攻击，不管是哪一种，都是替原本缺乏攻击能力的客户提供服务。
　　TAG发现，有的黑客租赁服务在各大地下论坛揽客，有的则相对低调，仅提供特定客户服务，例如有些位于印度的黑客租赁服务只与某些私人调查服务合作。
　　TAG主要公布了在印度、俄罗斯与阿联酋的黑客租赁服务，例如在印度发现有些从事黑客租赁服务的黑客曾在当地知名信息安全公司工作过，在俄罗斯发现的黑客租赁服务也是为了窃取电子邮件或社交网站的凭证。
　　由于这些黑客租赁服务绝大多数都是通过钓鱼来取得目标对象的凭证，因此它们也建立了不少仿冒合法域名名称的网钓网站，Google则已将这数十个域名名称全数列入了Safe Browsing中，以协助浏览器用户躲过这些恶意网站。
　　Safe Browsing是Google建立的恶意网站数据库，包括 Google Chrome、Safari、Firefox、Vivaldi及Brave等众多浏览器都已采用该数据库来保障用户的安全。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I first tried Linux somewhere around the late 1990s and a mild annoyance I found was that NumLock was off by default, so I always had to make explicit actions to use my numeric keypad.
 Since then, my life and career took a different path and I would eventually use Linux only on remote servers.
 I'm now back to Linux on the desktop after many years and I've been distro-hopping in VirtualBox to see what current offer is. And, to my surprise, every single distro I've tried has NumLock disabled by default. KDE Plasma even has a GUI app for this. Someone wrote an app to configure this specific key!
 GNU/Linux has accomplished awesome things in 25 years. What could possibly be the reasons why NumLock is still disabled on startup? Are there technical reasons? Cultural implications? Something else?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[一家中国公司发布了首款 RISC-V 笔记本电脑？

“RISC-V 国际”透露，一家名为“鉴释”的中国公司已经宣布了第一台面向开发者的 RISC-V 笔记本电脑，现已开放预订。据介绍，这个 “ROMA” 开发平台具有四核 RISC-V 处理器，高达 16GB 的内存，最大 256GB 的存储空间，并且可以运行大多数 RISC-V Linux 发行版。有趣的是，这家名为“鉴释”的公司原本是一家开发静态代码分析工具的公司，这个名为“ROMA”的新产品也无法在其中英文网站找到任何链接，只有一个孤儿 预定页，而预定页中提供一个表格，没有确定的价格或预期供应量的信息、甚至连概念图都没有，并且还提到了一些 Web3 和 NFT 的事情。

谷歌推出“高级 API 安全”服务

谷歌宣布了“高级 API 安全”的预览版，这是一个新产品，将在谷歌云上推出，旨在检测与 API 有关的安全威胁。该服务可以识别 API 错误配置和检测恶意机器人。配置错误的 API 是造成 API 安全事件的主要原因之一。开发者们越来越依赖 API，但它们也越来越成为攻击的目标。根据一份 2018 年的报告，三分之二的组织正在向公众和合作伙伴暴露了不安全的 API。


消息来源：Tech Crunch



老王点评：一个配置不当的 API，造成的影响可能非常可怕，我想网络安全圈子对这个很有感受。




Linux Mint 21 不准备用 oomd

Linux Mint 21 正在努力争取在今年夏天发布，它是建立在 Ubuntu 22.04 LTS 之上的。但因 Ubuntu 22.04 在 systemd-oomd 上广受批评，Linux Mint 决定不用这个服务来“屠杀”用户的应用。Canonical 公司的开发人员一直在努力修复这个问题，随着最新提出的 SRU 可能会有所改善。


消息来源：Phoronix



老王点评：Mint 做了明智的选择。这根本不是 oomd 的策略问题，而是不经过用户同意，甚至用户没有反对的机会，就被杀了应用。]]></summary>

 A question; how good has your experience been when running older games on Linux?
 Some background: a few months ago, I got really annoyed with Windows 11. The forced updates were bad enough, but then I saw a login box in the file explorer. That was what pushed me over the edge to nuke my windows install and go full Linux, even knowing the caveats of Nvidia drivers and having to tinker with things. 
 For the most part, Steam is a good experience. You do have to know what you're doing, but most of the games from recent years play well. Even some old…]]></summary>

 来源：澎湃新闻
                

王宏志（章静绘）
作为中英官方的第一次正式接触，1793年马戛尔尼使团访华对两国的历史发展均有深远影响。在过往研究中，翻译在使团活动里所扮演的角色不为人关注。香港中文大学翻译系荣休讲座教授兼研究教授、翻译研究中心主任王宏志的新作《龙与狮的对话：翻译与马戛尔尼访华使团》运用大量档案和文献材料，厘清译员背景以及国书、敕谕等各类文书的翻译和改写问题，力图还原中英首次对话的内容和翻译过程。围绕如何解读英国使团访华事件、翻译在近代中外交往活动中的作用，以及翻译史的研究方法，《上海书评》专访了王宏志教授。
《龙与狮的对话：翻译与马戛尔尼访华使团》，王宏志著，香港中文大学出版社，2022年6月出版，532页，42.00美元
您的早期著作都与文学有关，如《鲁迅与左联》《文学与政治之间：鲁迅·新月·文学史》《历史的偶然：从香港看中国现代文学史》。您是如何从文学研究转入翻译研究的？

王宏志：我大学本科读的是翻译与中国文学。硕士和博士学位论文都属于现代中国文学范畴，硕士论文题目是“新月诗派研究”，博士论文则写中国左翼作家联盟。不过，我从小对历史就有很深厚的爱好，在读完大学第一年后曾想过转读历史，还跟一位中文系的老师谈过，但他大力劝阻，其中最主要的理由是就业的问题。他说，读完历史，唯一的工作就是当中学老师。这在当时算不上理想的职业。然而，对历史的兴趣一直非常浓厚，即使在后来在研究生阶段，也感觉自己的研究能力是在历史方面。例如在写新月诗派的时候，较满意的部分是有关诗派的历史发展、社会背景和人际脉络方面，对于诗歌的分析，往往没有很大的把握，时常担心会流于个人主观的评论。博论方面，整篇论文都是探讨左联的历史发展和地位，重点分析1930年代左翼文学阵营内外的人际关系、矛盾和论战，以至左联在整个1930年代中国共产主义活动的角色，…]]></summary>

使用 Kubernetes 来编排容器，这种描述说起来简单，但理解它的实际含义以及如何实现它完全是另外一回事。如果你正在运行或管理 Kubernetes 集群，那么你就会知道 Kubernetes 由一台称为 “控制平面control plane” 的机器和许多其他 工作节点worker node 机器组成。每种类型都有一个复杂但稳定的堆栈，这使编排成为可能，熟悉每个组件有助于理解它是如何工作的。

控制平面组件

Kubernetes 安装在一个称为“控制平面control plane”的机器上，它会运行 Kubernetes 守护进程，并在启动容器和容器组pod时与之通信。下面介绍控制平面的各个组件。

etcd

etcd 是一种快速、分布式一致性键值存储器，用作 Kubernetes 对象数据的持久存储，如容器组、副本控制器、密钥和服务。etcd 是 Kubernetes 存储集群状态和元数据的唯一地方。唯一与 etcd 直连的组件是 Kubernetes API 服务器。其他所有组件都通过 API 服务器间接的从 etcd 读写数据。

etcd 还实现了一个监控功能，它提供了一个基于事件的接口，用于异步监控键的更改。一旦你更改了一个键，它的监控者就会收到通知。API 服务器组件严重依赖于此来获得通知，并将 etcd 变更至期望状态。

为什么 etcd 实例的数量应该是奇数？

你通常会运行三个、五个或七个 etcd 实例实现高可用（HA）环境，但这是为什么呢？因为 etcd 是分布式数据存储，可以水平扩展它，但你需要确保每个实例中的…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[VLC 是 Linux 和其他平台上最受欢迎的视频播放器之一。

它不仅仅是一个视频播放器。它提供了许多多媒体和网络相关的功能。你会惊讶地 了解 VLC 的能力。

我将演示一个简单的 VLC 功能，即使用它下载 YouTube 视频。

是的。你可以在 VLC 中播放 YouTube 视频并下载它们。让我告诉你怎么做。（LCTT 校注：发布此文只探讨技术可行性。）

使用 VLC 媒体播放器下载 YouTube 视频

现在，有一些方法可以 下载 YouTube 视频。使用浏览器扩展或使用专门的网站或工具。

但是如果你不想使用任何额外的东西，已经安装的 VLC 播放器可以用于此目的。

**重要提示：**在从 YouTube 复制链接之前，请确保从 YouTube 播放器中选择所需的视频质量，因为我们将获得与复制链接时流式传输视频相同的质量。

步骤 1：获取所需视频的视频链接

你可以使用任何你喜欢的浏览器并从地址栏中复制视频链接。



步骤 2：将复制的链接粘贴到网络流

“网络流Network Stream”选项位于“媒体Media”菜单下，这是我们顶部菜单栏的第一个选项。你也可以使用快捷方式 CTRL + N 打开网络流 。



现在，你只需粘贴复制的 YouTube 视频链接，然后单击播放按钮。我知道它只是在我们的 VLC 中播放视频，但还有一点额外的步骤可以让我们下载当前的流媒体视频。



步骤 3：从编解码器信息中获取位置链接

在“编解码器信息Codec Information”下，我们会得到当前播放视频的位置链接。要打开编解码器信息，你可以使用快捷键 CTRL + J 或者你会在“工具Tools”菜单下找到编解码器信息选项。



它将带来有关当前流媒体视频的详细信息。但我们需要的是“位置Location”。你只需复制位置链接，我们的任务就完成了 90%。



步骤 4：将位置链接粘贴到新选项卡

打开任何你喜欢的浏览器，并将复制的位置链接粘贴到新选项卡，它将开始在浏览器中播放该视频。

现在，右键单击播放视频，你将看到“将视频另存为”的选项。



它将打开文件管理器并询问你是否要在本地保存此视频。你还可以重命名该文件，默认情况下它将被命名为 “videoplayback.mp4”。



结论

如果你有互联网连接问题，或者如果你想保存一些视频以供将来观看，下载 YouTube 视频是有意义的。

当然，我们不鼓励盗版。此方法仅用于合理使用，请确保视频的创建者已允许该视频进行合理使用，并确保在将其用于其他地方之前将其归属于视频的原始所有者。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Seriously the open source nature of the Linux ecosystem means that so many x86_64 programs people use can be ported by mostly just recompiling them. Things are just so much easier to update in an open source ecosystem because it doesn't rely on one specific party to update a piece of software. In an open source environment everyone can do it which means that if either there are enough people interested in continuing to use the software so it is worth porting it or there is a super passionate community that's still submitting patches.
 If competitive desktop class ARM chips would start launching right now switching over from x86_64 on Linux is going to be way less of a hurdle than switching from x86_64 to ARM on Windows.
 EDIT: Whoops forgot to remove Apple from the title. Apple is pretty much already there so it really doesn't belong.

 Ubuntu Budgie gives a fresh look to a stable environment, I did not encounter any errors while trying out the system and that's why I am encouraging everyone to try it out and support the team. Super secure and less buggy compared to other distros. I loved the layout the most and the customizations of the icons to match what you are already used to. T…]]></summary>

A ton of people say that Go's standard library is really powerful and usually enough to get by without external dependencies. I think that's true for companies that have the resources to build and maintain packages to reduce code duplication. For everyone else, we're left to finding the right set of packages to build our projects.
So, I built Copper - a toolkit that helps you get your project off the ground with minimal dependencies. It covers everything from routing, html, storage to tooling and more.
Check it out, star it, and feel free to ask questions!
P.S.
I also have a video demo building an HN clone in the docs

 Also, They are not available in flatpak or appimage. Flatpak version of gzdoom is outdated and i guess is not officially supported
 How can we urge developers to package them in appimage or flatpak? I cannot trust unofficial flatpaks as most of them become outdated.
 Is compiling from source the ONLY way to get such packages? Compiling is very difficult (for me) - many dependencies, then it takes a LONG time in my crappy pc.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[数年后 Ubuntu Unity 桌面起死回生

Ubuntu 的 Unity 桌面已经很久没有更新了，上一次它还是 Ubuntu 17.04 中出现的 Unity 7.5。Ubuntu 背后的 Canonical 公司随后放弃了对 Unity 的开发支持。但是一些喜欢它的开发者们建立了 UnityX 项目，从而今年我们见到了 Unity 7.6，它被搭载在非官方的 Ubuntu Unity 合成版中。当然，你也可以在普通的 Ubuntu 上安装它。这是另一个完全不像 Windows 的少数选项。


消息来源：The Register



老王点评：Unity 本身好不好，是不是更流行并不重要，重要的是，开源世界是自由的，你有随时再造一个轮子的自由。这很重要。




软件自由保护协会抨击 GitHub

软件自由保护协会（SFC）专注于保护自由和开源软件，说它已经停止使用微软的 GitHub 进行项目托管，并敦促其他软件开发者也这样做。他们在其网站上增加了一个放弃 GitHub 的说明，并督促自由和开源软件开发者们自愿切换到不同的代码托管服务。SFC 与 GitHub 的决裂最终是由 GitHub Copilot 导致的。他们说，GitHub 决定发布一个源自 FOSS 代码的营利性产品，这“太让人难以忍受了”。Copilot 的训练数据来自 GitHub 上的公共存储库中的代码，但是并没有说明这些代码所附带的软件许可证和版权持有人是什么。


消息来源：The Register



老王点评：确实，似乎 Copilot 有意无意的忽视了用来训练的代码的许可证问题，所以，你很可能在得到的建议中采用了各种许可证的代码，即便只是几行。这从跟本上打击了开源许可证的严肃性。




无视谷歌、Mozilla 反对，万维网联盟发布了 DID 规范

去中心化标识符（DID）规范描述了一种部署全球唯一标识符的方法，而无需一个中心化的机构作为验证实体。它们旨在使个人和组织能够使用他们信任的系统生成自己的标识符，这些新的标识符使实体能够通过使用数字签名等加密证明来证明对它们的控制。DID 的格式类似 did:方法:特定标识。但谷歌、Mozilla 提出了反对意见，DID 中的“方法”没有定义，所以没有办法评估 DID 将如何运作，也没有办法确定如何处理互操作。他们还担心依靠工作证明量的区块链来处理 DID 的道德问题。


消息来源：The Register



老王点评：虽然这很去中心化，但是我怀疑由中心化组织提出的去中心化规范，是否真的有用？]]></summary>

今天我在推特上发布了一些关于 OSI 模型如何与 TCP/IP 工作原理的实际表现不相符的观点，这让我思考——OSI 模型到底是什么？通过阅读推特上的一些回复发现，似乎至少存在三种不同的思考方式：


TCP/IP 工作原理的字面描述

一个可以用来描述和比较很多不同的网络协议的抽象模型

对 1980 年代的一些计算机网络协议的字面描述，这些协议如今大多已不再使用


在这篇文章中，我不打算试图争辩以上哪一个才是“真正”的 OSI 模型——似乎不同的人以所有这些方式思考它。这不重要。

OSI 模型有七层

在我们讨论 OSI 模型的含义之前，让我们大致地讨论一下它是什么。它是一个抽象模型，用于描述网络如何在七个编号的层上工作：


第一层：物理层

第二层：数据链路层

第三层：网络层

第四层：传输层

第五层：会话层

第六层：表示层

第七层：应用层


我不会再费时地去解释每一层的含义，网上有上千种解释可供查询。

OSI 模型：TCP/IP 工作原理的字面描述

首先，我想谈谈人们在实践中使用 OSI 模型的一种常见方式：作为对 TCP/IP 工作原理的字面描述。OSI 模型的某些层非常容易映射到 TCP/IP：


第二层对应以太网

第三层对应 IP

第四层对应 TCP 或 UDP（或 ICMP 等）

第七层对应 TCP 或 UDP 包内的任何内容（例如 DNS 查询）


这种映射对第二、三、四层很有意义——TCP 数据包有三个标头header对应于这三个层（以太网标头、IP 标头和 TCP 标头）。

用数字来描述 TCP 数据包中的不同标头非常有用——如果你说“第二层”，很显然它位于第三层“下方”，因为二比三小。

“OSI 模型作为字面描述”的古怪之处在于，第五层和第六层并不真正对应于 TCP/IP 中的任何内容——我听说过很多关于第五层或第六层可能是什么的不同解释（你可以说第五层是 TLS 或其他东西！）但它们没有像第二、三、四层那样“每一层在 TCP 数据包中都有相应的标头”这样的明确对应关系。

此外，TCP/IP 的某些部分即使在第二层到第四层也不能很好地适应 OSI 模型——例如，哪一层是 ARP 数据包？ARP 数据包发送一些带有以太网标头的数据，这是否意味着它们是第三层？或是第二层？列出不同 OSI 层的维基百科文章将其归类为“第 2.5 层”，这并不令人满意。

因为 OSI 模型有时用于教授 TCP/IP，若搞不清楚它的哪些部分可以映射到 TCP/IP，而哪些部分不能，则会令人困惑。这才是真的问题。

OSI 模型：用于比较网络协议的一个抽象

我听说过的另一种关于 OSI 的思考方式是，它是一种抽象，可以用来在许多不同的网络协议之间进行类比。例如，如果你想了解蓝牙协议的工作原理，也许你可以使用 OSI 模型来帮助你——这是我在 这个网页 上找到的一张图表，显示了蓝牙协议如何适配 OSI 模型。



另一个例子是，这篇维基百科文章 有一个 OSI 层列表，详细划分了哪些特定的网络协议对应于这些 OSI 层。

OSI 模型：一些过时协议的字面描述

维基百科上的一些非常简短的研究表明，除了对这七层的抽象描述之外，OSI 模型还包含了 一组实现这些层的特定协议。显然，这发生在 70 年代和 80 年代的 协议战争 时期，OSI 模型失败了，TCP/IP 则取得了胜利。

这就解释了为什么 OSI 模型无法与 TCP/IP 很好地对应，因为如果当时“获胜”的是 OSI 协议，那么 OSI 模型 将 完全对应于互联网网络的实际工作方式。

结语

我写这篇文章的初衷是，当我最初学习 OSI 模型时，我发现它非常令人困惑（所有这些层是什么？它们是真实存在的吗？这是网络的实际工作原理吗？发生了什么？）我希望有人告诉我这个只使用 TCP/IP 网络协议的人，只需了解 OSI 模型第二、三、四和七层与 TCP/IP 的关系，然后忽略它的所有其他内容即可。所以我希望这篇文章对某些人能有所帮助！

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[在之前的一篇文章中，我介绍了使用 pandoc 将少量 Markdown 文件 批量转换 为 HTML 的过程。在那篇文章中，我创建了多个 HTML 文件，但 Pandoc 可以做的更多。它被称为文档转换的“瑞士军刀” —— 这是有充分理由的。很少有它做不到的事情。

Pandoc 可以将 .docx、.odt、.html、.epub、LaTeX、DocBook 等格式互相转换，或者转换为其他格式，例如 JATS、TEI Simple、AsciiDoc 等。

是的，这意味着 Pandoc 可以将 .docx 文件转换为 .pdf 和 .html 文件，但你可能会想：“Word 也可以将文件导出为 .pdf 和 .html。为什么我需要 Pandoc 呢？”

嗯，本来呢，你这个说法也没错，但考虑到 Pandoc 可以转换这么多格式，它很可能成为你所有转换任务的首选工具。例如，我们中的许多人都知道 Markdown 编辑器 可以将其 Markdown 文件导出为 .html。而使用 Pandoc 文件也可以转换为许多其他格式。

我很少将 Markdown 导出为 HTML。我通常让 Pandoc 来做这件事。

使用 Pandoc 转换文件格式



本文中，我会将 Markdown 文件转换成几种不同的格式。我几乎所有的写作都使用 Markdown 语法，但我经常需要转换为另一种格式：学校作业通常需要的 .docx 格式；我创建的网页通常需要的 .html 格式；工作需要的 .epub 格式；传单和讲义需要的 .pdf 格式；甚至包括一个大学数字人文项目偶尔需要的 TEI Simple 格式。Pandoc 可以轻松处理所有这些格式，甚至更多。

首先，你需要 安装 pandoc。此外，要创建 .pdf 文件，还需要 LaTeX。我最喜欢的套件是 TeX …]]></summary>

《法律与书商：商业出版与清代法律知识的传播》，[美] 张婷著，张田田译，社会科学文献出版社/启微，2022年4月版，260页，69.00元
张婷《法律与书商：商业出版与清代法律知识的传播》（原书名Circulating the Code: Print Media and Legal Knowledge in Qing China，张田田译，社会科学文献出版社，2022年4 月）的中心主题是清代法律书籍的商业出版及其对清代法律制度、法律文化和法律知识传播的影响，具体的论述包括了清代的立法与官方律典的产生及其阅读、律典出版传播的需求与商业化、通俗法律文本与法律知识的传播等议题。梅尔清（Tobie Meyer-Fong）在“序二”中谈到过去二十年间用英文写作的中国早期近代书籍史与法律史研究成果众多，但是这两个领域相对独立、少有交集。在我的阅读印象中也的确是这样。准确来说，在法律史研究著述中（可参见曾宪义主编《百年回眸：法律史研究在中国》，共五册，中国人民大学出版社，2009年）就极为少见关于法律知识传播的研究，具体到与出版物、书商研究相联系就更是没有读过；而在书籍出版及印刷史研究的著述中，对法律知识的传播研究同样缺乏。以周绍明（Joseph P.McDermott）《书籍的社会史：中华帝国晚期的书籍与士人文化》（何朝晖译，北京大学出版社，2009年）为例，该书在关于明清商业出版物与知识传播、文化普及的众多论述中也没有提到法律读物，可以说明由于出版物类别众多、受众范围不同，除了儒学、文学等领域之外的其他专门领域是难于被纳入议题的。就此而言，梅尔清认为张婷“创新性地将这两个不同领域的研究进行了富有成效的对话”并非溢美之言；他对该书研究结论的表述也很具体和概括：“清代法律知识的广泛传播和法律书籍的出版由书商主导。坊刻律典中的…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[摘要：被洗脑的日本人民，即是战争的加害者，又是战争的受害者。只有推翻日本军国主义政府，让日本人民摆脱了洗脑控制而成为自由人，才是对这些人民最大的善意。
　　什么是军国主义
　　军国主义，即指崇尚武力和军事扩张，将穷兵黩武和侵略扩张作为立国之本，将国家完全置于军事控制之下，使政治、经济、文教等各个方面均服务于扩军备战及对外战争的思想和政治制度。军国主义是国家军事化的法西斯主义。
　　法西斯主义是一种威权的极端民族主义形式，其特点是独裁的公权力，强大的社会和经济统一执行力，以及强制镇压反对意见。法西斯主义者认为，自由民主已经过时，并认为在一个极权主义的一党制国家中完全动员社会是必要的，国家由一个强大的领导者来领导，以建立民族团结、维护一个稳定有序的社会。通用、泛型的法西斯主义有三项核心要素：极端民族主义、革命、及复兴。
　　军国主义的特点是，宣扬极端民族主义和国家主义（中央集权），教育以仇外主义、自我民族优越为教材，激发人民对邻国人民的民族仇恨情绪，试图对外实施穷兵黩武，外交以军事优势欺凌邻近地区，以谋求领土扩张和国际霸权。对内实施独裁统治，反战、人权、言论自由受到镇压。
　　日本军国主义的特点
　　日本军国主义在几十年的时间里，已经通过宣传机构将大部分日本民众彻底洗脑，二战期间，日本民众只能接收到官方的单方面信息，缺少独立思考和判断能力。
　　日本军国主义的主要宣传方法包括仇外主义、极端的民族主义和国家主义，国家拥有过度的公权力，强大的社会和经济统一执行力，以及强制镇压反对意见，国家能够动员数百万人在前线服务，提供经济生产和后勤支持他们。
　　大部分日本人受到日本军国主义宣传机器洗脑而对日本军国主义统治者的侵略战争产生了错误的认知，进而热情地投入政府的对外侵略工作。被洗脑的日本民众，实际上就是日本军国主义的爪牙和帮凶，他们在客观上为日本战争机器提供了人力物力，维持了日本战争机器的运转。
　　一亿玉碎
　　二战末期，日本军国主义大肆宣扬以“本土大决战”为名的“一亿玉碎”的计划，所谓“一亿玉碎”，是指在盟军进入日本岛后，日本上亿民众将拒绝投降，以生命来守护祖国家园。一旦这个计划真的实现，参战双方将付出巨大伤亡，盟军的伤亡预估约达数百万，而日本军民死伤则可能逾千万人。
　　实际上，盟军的战略目的是推翻日本政府，只要推翻了日本政府，就可以改变日本宣传机构，将被洗脑的日本民众恢复正常，战争就可以结束，无谓的牺牲就可以避免。如果日本民众冲在抵抗的前线，产生巨大伤亡就在所难免。
　　不过，在1945年8月15日，日本正式宣布了无条件投降。这个疯狂的计划，也最终没有被实行，其最主要的原因，就是美军的两次原子弹袭击。
　　1945年8月6日，美军在广岛上空投下第一颗原子弹，广岛瞬间被夷为平地，人员伤亡超过16万，8月9日，美军在长崎投下第二颗原子弹，人员伤亡超过8万，长崎遭受原子弹轰炸后6天，1945年8月15日，日本宣布无条件投降。
　　原子弹的出现，让日本政府产生了巨大的恐惧，这种大规模杀伤性武器可以在一瞬间毁灭一座城市，官员和平民都会无差别被杀死，这让日本上层官员不得不重新考虑，放弃抵抗而选择投降，而这种投降，反而挽救了数千万被洗脑的日本民众的命运。
　　总结
　　日本疯狂的“一亿玉碎”计划如果实施，还是可以造成巨大伤亡的。原子弹的出现，让“一亿玉碎”的计划化为泡影，避免了日本人口的大量损失，由于大部分日本人都受过良好的教育，让这些人死于本土作战无疑是日本难以承受的损失。
　　推翻日本军国主义政府后，日本人民摆脱了洗脑控制而成为自由人，日本在战后只用了30年不到就成为了世界第二大经济体，显然，高素质劳动力是日本快速崛起的重要基础，如果“一亿玉碎”作战计划付之实施，就不会有战后的日本经济奇迹了。]]></summary>

CPU time to all tasks in the system that is fair, allows all tasks to

the system's energy consumption.   There is currently a

　　张华的经历并非个例。6月26日晚间，全国多地网友爆料称，QQ平台出现大规模用户被盗号事件，被盗的QQ号深夜向多个好友及群聊发送不雅色情图片。
　　对此，腾讯QQ官方6月27日发表声明称，调查发现事件主要原因系用户扫描不法分子伪造的游戏登陆二维码并授权登陆，该登陆行为被黑产团伙劫持并记录，随后被不法分子利用发送不良图片广告。
　　涉事的第三方平台超星学习通客服此前回复澎湃新闻称，QQ账号被盗与平台没有关系。
　　稍早前，6月21日，该公司曾就“疑似学习通APP用户数据泄露”一事发布声明称，学习通已经向公安机关报案，公安机关已经介入调查。
　　相关律师分析认为，一旦查实黑产盗取大量QQ账号发布不雅图片，就构成非法利用信息系统罪。
　　有网络安全专家在接受澎湃新闻采访时表示，QQ生态非常开放，用户数据不仅可以授权给很多游戏平台，还可以授权给其他第三方社交媒体平台，在授权的过程中，用户的数据也顺带授权过去；此次事件，更多的责任可能在QQ授权的第三方平台。
　　QQ用户授权第三方平台时数据易泄露
　　2007年，张华注册了QQ号。最初，张华用QQ来聊天、玩小游戏。回忆起此前用QQ的时光，张华说“算是一种童年的回忆。”
　　QQ空间互踩、QQ游戏大厅里的斗地主小游戏，让张华印象深刻。他对QQ有一种情结，即便随着各种社交媒体的普及应用，他还是会时不时登陆QQ。慢慢地，QQ在他看来成了一个用来联系旧时好友的小角落，“会时不时登陆进去看看有没有消息遗落”。
　　此次“QQ盗号”事件里，张华有100多位QQ好友收到了用张华QQ号发送的色情图片和链接。盗号事件发生后，张华曾向平台提起申…]]></summary>

算法可提前一周预测犯罪，准确率 90%

芝加哥大学的科学家们开发了一种新的算法，可以提前一周预测未来的犯罪，准确率约为 90%，它将城市划分为大约 1000 英尺宽的“空间瓦片”，并预测这些区域内的犯罪。该工具使用芝加哥市围绕暴力犯罪和财产犯罪事件的历史数据进行了测试和验证。该模型在美国其他七个城市的数据中表现同样出色。

俄罗斯人正在转向 Linux 和盗版

据《莫斯科时报》上周五报道，在微软公司于 3 月 4 日暂停俄罗斯的销售后，俄罗斯政府机构正在从微软的 Windows 系统转向 Linux 操作系统。另据《生意人报》报道，俄罗斯基于 Linux 开源操作系统的开发商也看到了更多的需求。但并非所有部门都能轻易换掉他们的系统，俄罗斯的网络上搜索盗版软件的数量激增了 250%。6 月至今，Excel 下载的搜索量激增了 650%。

使用 Bash 脚本语言进行编程时，有时需要创建一个临时文件。例如，你可能需要一个可以提交到磁盘的中间文件，以便你可以使用另一个命令对其进行处理。创建诸如 temp 之类的文件或任何以 .tmp 结尾的文件很容易。但是，这些名称很可能是由其他进程生成的，因此你可能会不小心覆盖现有的临时文件。除此之外，你不应该花费脑力想出看起来独特的名字。基于 Fedora 的系统上的 mktemp 命令和基于 Debian 的系统上的 tempfile 是专门为减轻这种负担而设计的，它使创建、使用和删除独特的文件变得容易。

创建一个临时文件

mktemp 和 tempfile 都创建一个临时文件作为它们的默认操作，并打印文件的名称和位置作为输出：

$ tempfile
/tmp/fileR5dt6r

$ mktemp 
/tmp/tmp.ojEfvMaJEp


除非你指定不同的路径，否则系统会将临时文件放在 /tmp 目录中。

对于 mktemp，可以使用 -p 选项指定路径：

$ mktemp -p ~/Demo
/home/tux/Demo/tmp.i8NuhzbEJN


对于 tempfile，可以使用 --directory 或 -d 选项：

$ tempfile --directory ~/Demo/
/home/sek/Demo/fileIhg9aX


找到你的临时文件

使用自动生成的临时文件的问题是你无法知道它的名字是什么。这就是为什么两个命令都返回生成的文件名作为输出的原因。你可以使用 Konsole、GNOME 终端或 rxvt…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[了解由我们生活中的所有连接设备组成的网络。




在早期，计算机既笨重又昂贵，计算机用户很少，他们必须在计算机上的预留时间内亲自来处理他们的打孔卡punchcard。被称为 大型机Mainframe 的系统进行了许多创新，并在终端机terminal（没有自己的 CPU 的桌面计算机）上实现了分时time-shared任务。

时至今日，强大的计算设备能做到 价格低至 35 美元，且大小不超过一张信用卡。这甚至还没有涵盖现代生活中负责收集和处理数据的所有小设备。从高层次的角度来看这些计算机的集合，你可以想象得到，所有这些设备多得像云中的水滴一样。

碰巧“云计算cloud computing”一词已经被占用，因此需要为由物联网（IoT）和其他具有战略意义的服务器组成的网络提供一个独特的名称。此外，如果已经有一个代表数据中心节点的云，那么在云之外与我们交融的这些节点肯定有其独特之处。

欢迎来到雾计算

云通过互联网提供计算服务。构成云的数据中心很大，但与潜在客户的数量相比相对较少。这表明当数据在云及其众多用户之间来回传送时存在潜在的瓶颈。

相比之下，雾计算Fog Computing可以在数量上超过其潜在客户，而不会出现瓶颈，因为设备执行大部分数据的收集或计算。它是云的外部“边缘”，是云落地的部分。

雾和边缘计算

雾计算和 边缘计算edge computing 本质上是同义词。两者都与云和物联网密切相关，并做出相同的架构假设：


你离 CPU 越近，数据传输就越快。

像 Linux 一样，小型专用计算机，可以“做一件事并把它做好”，这是一个强大的优势（当然，我们的设备实际上不仅仅做一件事，但从高层次上看，你购买的用于监测健康的智能手表本质上是在做“一”件事）。

离线是不可避免的，但好的设备可以在此期间同样有效地运行，然后在重新连接时同步。

本地设备能比大型数据中心更简单、更便宜。


边缘网络

将雾计算视为与云完全分离的实体很诱人，但它们毕竟是组成一个整体的两个部分。云需要数字企业的基础设施，包括公共云提供商、电信公司，甚至是运行自己服务的专业公司。本地化服务也很重要，可以在云核心与其数以百万计的客户之间提供中转站waystations。

雾计算位于云的边缘，无论客户身在何处，都与他们紧密联系在一起。有时这是一个消费环境，例如你自己的家或汽车，而另一些时候这是一种商业利益，例如零售店中的价格监控设备或工厂车间的重要的安全传感器。

雾计算就在你身边

雾计算由我们生活中的所有连接设备组成：无人机drone、电话、手表、健身监视器、安全监视器、家庭自动化、便携式游戏设备、园艺自动化、天气传感器、空气质量监视器等等。理想情况下，它提供的数据有助于建立一个更好、更明智的未来。有许多伟大的开源项目正朝着改善健康的方向而努力 —— 甚至只是让生活变得更有趣一点儿 —— 这一切都得益于雾和云计算。无论如何，我们的 工作是确保它 保持开放。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[无服务器计算将服务器从规划中移除，使企业能够专注于应用功能。那么，企业是不是都应该选择无服务器计算呢？让我们来探究一下吧！




直至不久之前，几乎每个产品经理都会将他/她的工程资源，分成两个独立的团队 —— 开发团队和运维团队。开发团队通常参与编码、测试和构建应用功能，而运维团队负责应用程序的交付、部署和运行维护。

当开发团队构建电商应用时，运维团队会搭建好服务器来托管该应用。搭建服务器涉及到许多方面，其中包括：


选择合适的硬件和操作系统

应用所需的补丁集

搭建所需服务器环境，如 JDK、Python、Tomcat、NodeJS 等

部署、配置和提供实际的应用

打开并固定合适的端口

搭建所需的数据库引擎


……这个名单还在继续。

除此之外，管理人员还对容量规划感到头疼。毕竟，任何重要应用都应始终保持 100% 可用、可靠且可扩展。这需要对硬件进行最佳投资。众所周知，在一些关键时期，硬件短缺会导致业务损失，而硬件冗余又会损害利润。因此，无论应用是针对本地数据中心，还是针对云基础架构，容量规划都是至关重要的。到目前为止，很明显，企业不仅在功能构建上投入了大量的精力，还在功能交付上也花费了大量的时间。

无服务器计算Serverless computing旨在提供一种无缝的方式来交付功能，而无需担心服务器的设置和维护。换句话说，无服务器计算平台提供了一个“即用型ready-to-use”环境，企业可以尽快将应用程序构建和部署为一些较小的功能。这就是为什么这种方法被称为“功能即服务Function as a Service”（FaaS）。

请记住，无服务器计算中仍然存在服务器，但它由 AWS、微软和谷歌等 FaaS 供应商负责。

例如，AWS 以 “Lambda 函数”的形式提供了一个无服务器计算环境。开发人员可以选择将…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So I'm new to Linux. I built a PC about a month ago and thought to myself, "hey, why don't I install a Linux distro on this thing?". It's FOSS, plus I won't have to pay for Windows, and it's more efficient and customizable... My escapades on the internet had led me to believe that Linux is just superior, and NT-based Microsoft Windows is a bloatware-ridden fossil that needs to die. I was convinced the only reason Linux hadn't replaced Windows was simple user inertia: nobody thought to switch, and most people didn't know they had a choice. But once the final kinks (like those experienced by Linus Tech Tips & Co.) get ironed out, all that can change with a bit enthusiastic publicity! We're on our way to greatness! The Year of the Linux Desktop is just around the corner!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I recently thrifted an old Iomega zip 100 drive (parallel port version) and got a few discs for it, mostly for the novelty.
 Ive been trying to get it working on my linux machine so i can mess around with it but im not quite sure how to go about that.
 Ive found a couple threads that mention some sort of 'ppa' module but beyond activating that i cant really tell if its doing anything or if the module is even on. Most of the threads are mentioning ubuntu or lubuntu, but i just have archcraft at the moment so ive been sorta stumbling thru adapting commands for arch without much luck. 
 The drive does appear to be good. no click of death, it spins up fine when a disc is inserted and it ejects discs just fine as well, 
 Im a little lost so any help or vague ideas to get it working are appreciated. 
 Ill post links to the threads ive been looking at if i remember, Most of them arent too old
 Hardware:
 Dell lattitude D830 with port expander dock thing running Archcraft (5.18.7 according to neofetch) 
 Iomega Zip 100 drive running thru native parallel (Plugged into port on dock) 100 mb discs

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ok, maybe a stupid question but...
 Is there any way for me to use two computers at once while using the same mouse and keyboard, but have them act as if they were two monitors on the same system?
 I have a desktop running Windows 10, and a laptop running Linux. Can I connect my keyboard and mouse to both of them and have them act as if they're both part of the same system.
 I want to do this just so it's easier for me to learn the system a bit easier and make some projects.
 I don't know if this is a stupid idea but it works well in my mind, on a technical aspect I have no idea if it would work but would appreciate if anyone can point out what I would need to do.
 (I know I could use VMware to do this, but would be nice if I could do without)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Software Freedom Conservancy (SFC) has issued a strong call for free software projects to give up GitHub and to move their repositories elsewhere.  There are a number of problems that SFC has identified with the GitHub code-hosting service and, in particular, with its Copilot AI-based code-writing tool that was trained on the community's code stored in the company's repositories.  Moving away from GitHub will not be easy, SFC said, but it is important to do so lest the free-software community repeat the SourceForge mistake.


Specifically, we at Software Freedom Conservancy have been actively communicating with Microsoft and their GitHub subsidiary about our concerns with "Copilot" since they first launched it almost exactly a year ago. Our initial video chat call (in July 2021) with Microsoft and GitHub representatives resulted in several questions which they said they could not answer at that time, but would "answer soon". [...] Last week, after we reminded GitHub of (a) the pending questions that we'd waited a year for them to answer and (b) of their refusal to join public discussion on the topic, they responded a week later, saying they would not join any public nor private discussion on this matter because "a broader conversation [about the ethics of AI-assisted software] seemed unlikely to alter your [SFC's] stance, which is why we [GitHub] have not responded to your [SFC's] detailed questions". In other words, GitHub's final position on Copilot is: if you disagree with GitHub about policy matters related to Copilot, then you don't deserve a reply from Microsoft or GitHub. They only will bother to reply if they think they can immediately change your policy position to theirs. But, Microsoft and GitHub will leave you hanging for a year before they'll tell you that!]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I was... really inquisitive over the last weekend. It's obvious that an NVMe drive is going to be faster than an SD Card, but by how much is actually a really important question. And is a MicroSD faster than a Hard Drive? Technically yes, but not by a whole lot.
 I've compiled a table of Devices, Storage Mediums, File Systems and tested all of them on their load times in Horizon Zero Dawn. The way I tested was: Turn off device. Turn on device. Turn on game. Load in the same exact save point. Average of 3. This prevented any sort of data caching from occurring in order to get accurate test results.
 The results, while somewhat predictable, are also quite interesting. You can find the full list here for you convenience but here are some interesting titbits:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[不值得使用 -O3 来编译 Linux 内核

在内核社区有人 建议 在更多范围内使用-O3 编译优化参数后，Linus Torvalds 迅速 驳斥 了这一想法，因为在他看来，这带来的潜在问题更多。Phoronix 使用其著名的测试套件对 -O3 编译的内核性能进行了测试。结论是：在 230 项测试中，-O3 内核的性能只领先了 1.3%，仅在压力测试软件 Stress-NG 的上下文切换基准中有近三倍的提升，一些数据库场景有 10% 左右的提升，其它场景仅有 2% 左右的变化。总体来说，考虑到 -O3 带来的过度优化的潜在风险，使用这个优化参数没什么意义。

Firefox 102 现在可以自动删除 URL 中的跟踪器

这项名为“查询参数剥离”的新功能，可以在你点击一个链接时自动删除 URL 中的跟踪参数。很多网站会在 URL 中附加特定的查询字符串来跟踪链接访问，比如 Facebook 使用的是 fbclid= 。Mozilla 大约在一年前开始研究这一功能，现在它已经准备好供公众使用。这项新功能是严格跟踪保护规则的一部分，但默认情况下是禁用的，因为有可能会破坏正常浏览体验。

老王点评：看得出来，虽然 Firefox 有种种不尽如人意之处，但是对用户隐私的保护真是竭尽全力了。




欧美大范围的路由器受到了新的、异常复杂的恶意软件的攻击

安全研究人员报告说，一个异常先进的黑客组织花了近两年时间，用恶意软件感染了北美和欧洲的各种路由器，完全控制了与路由器连接的 Windows、macOS 和 Linux 设备。他们已经发现至少有 80 个目标被这种隐秘的恶意软件感染，感染的路由器包括思科、Netgear、华硕等制造的设备。它能够列举所有连接到受感染的路由器的设备，并收集它们发送和接收的 DNS 查询和网络流量，并保持不被发现。


消息来源：ArsTechnica



老王点评：这是专门针对小型办公室和家庭办公室路由器编译的定制恶意软件，背后所图甚大。]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[6月30日消息，据国外媒体报道，美国联邦通信委员会(FCC)委员共和党成员布伦丹·卡尔(Brendan Carr)呼吁苹果和谷歌从他们的应用商店中移除中国短视频程序抖音的海外版TikTok。
　　据悉，卡尔公开了写给苹果和谷歌母公司Alphabet首席执行官蒂姆·库克(Tim Cook)和桑达·皮采(Sundar Pichai)的一封信。他在信中写道：“TikTok相当于一种复杂的监控工具，可以收集大量的个人信息和敏感数据。”
　　在卡尔致信苹果和谷歌两家公司的一周前，美国新闻网站BuzzFeed披露说，尽管TikTok表示是由美国的安全团队决定谁能获取美国用户的数据，但是TikTok中国母公司字节跳动的雇员多次获取美国用户的非公开数据。
　　TikTok一位发言人此前表示，BuzzFeed最近的报道显示的正是TikTok正在解决对美国用户数据被美国境外员工获取的担忧。这位发言人没有具体回应卡尔的信，只是表示，TikTok现在已通过甲骨文(Oracle)云基础设施传输所有美国用户数据，并且继续努力为美国数据提供更多保护。
　　但卡尔认为，TikTok将美国用户数据存储在美国的甲骨文服务器上并不能解决安全担忧。他表示TikTok的行为模式与苹果和谷歌应用商店多条涉及隐私以及数据搜集使用的政策相违背。
　　但是他的请求可能并不得获得支持，因为FCC无权监管应用商店，而且该机构的议程主要由其民主党籍主席制定。
　　早在2020年，唐纳德 · 特朗普总统签署了两项旨在禁止 TikTok 在美国使用的行政命令。2021年6月，拜登政府废除了前任的TikTok禁令，代之以一个新的程序来审查这类应用是否构成威胁。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[rustup 可用于 Rust 安装与更新。它还能够在稳定版、测试版和每日更新版之间无缝切换 Rust 编译器及其工具。


Rust 编程语言 如今变得越来越流行，受到爱好者和公司的一致好评。它受欢迎的原因之一是 Rust 提供的令人惊叹的工具，使其成为开发人员使用的乐趣。rustup 是管理 Rust 工具的官方工具。它不仅可以安装和更新 Rust ，它还能够在稳定版、测试版和每日更新版之间无缝切换 Rust 编译器及其工具。本文将向你介绍 rustup 及其一些常用命令。

默认 Rust 安装方式

如果你想在 Linux 上安装 Rust，你可以使用你的包管理器。在 Fedora 或 CentOS Stream 上，你可以这样：

$ sudo dnf install rust cargo


这提供了一个稳定版的 Rust 工具链，如果你是 Rust 的初学者，并想尝试编译和运行简单的程序，它会非常有用。但是，由于 Rust 是一种新的编程语言，它变化很快，并且经常添加许多新功能。这些功能是 Rust 工具链的每日更新版和之后测试版的一部分。要试用这些功能，你需要安装这些较新版本的工具链，而不会影响系统上的稳定版本。不幸的是，你的发行版的包管理器在这里无法做到。

使用 rustup 安装 Rust 工具链

要解决上述问题，你可以下载安装脚本：

$ curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 \
    -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs > sh.rustup.rs


检查它，然后运行它。它不需要 root 权限，并根据你的本地用户权限安装 Rust：

$ file sh.rustup.rs
sh.rustup.rs: POSIX shell script, ASCII text executable
$ less sh.rustup.rs
$ bash sh.rustup.rs


出现提示时选择选项 1：

1) Proceed with installation (default)
2) Customize installation
3) Cancel installation
> 1


安装后，你必须获取环境变量以确保 rustup 命令立即可供你运行：

$ source $HOME/.cargo/env


验证是否安装了 Rust 编译器（rustc）和 Rust 包管理器（cargo）：

$ rustc --version
$ cargo --version


查看已安装和可用的工具链

你可以使用以下命令查看已安装的不同工具链以及哪个工具链是可用的：

$ rustup show


在工具链之间切换

你可以查看默认工具链并根据需要进行更改。如果你当前使用的是稳定版工具链，并希望尝试每日更新版中提供的新功能，你可以轻松切换到每日更新版工具链：

$ rustup default
$ rustup default nightly


要查看 Rust 的编译器和包管理器的完整路径：

$ rustup which rustc
$ rustup which cargo


检查和更新工具链

要检查是否有新的 Rust 工具链可用：

$ rustup check


假设一个新版本的 Rust 发布了，其中包含一些有趣的特性，并且你想要获取最新版本的 Rust。你可以使用 update 子命令来做到这一点：

$ rustup update


帮助和文档

以上命令对于日常使用来说绰绰有余。尽管如此，rustup 有多种命令，你可以参考帮助部分了解更多详细信息：

$ rustup --help


rustup 在 GitHub 上有完整的 参考手册，你可以用作参考。所有 Rust 文档都安装在你的本地系统上，不需要你连接到互联网。你可以访问包括书籍、标准库等在内的本地文档：

$ rustup doc
$ rustup doc --book
$ rustup doc --std
$ rustup doc --cargo


Rust 是一种正在积极开发中的令人兴奋的语言。如果你对编程的发展方向感兴趣，请关注 Rust！

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[这是如何在 elementary OS 中启用最小化、最大化窗口按钮的方法。


许多人（大多数是 elementary OS 的新用户）在各种论坛上问这些问题：


我怎样才能在 elementary OS 中启用最小化按钮？

我如何启用还原、最小化、最大化？

有可能恢复最小化和最大化按钮吗？


这些都是完全正常的问题，而且问问题也是可以的。对吧？这篇指南可以帮助他们在 elementary OS 中获得这些按钮。

Elementary OS 所使用的 Pantheon 桌面并没有默认的标准窗口按钮。其主要原因是通过 Dock 和应用菜单处理用户行为和活动的不同理念。可以说，这种设计或实现的行为模仿了macOS。

不过，许多用户更喜欢窗口按钮，因为这是一个所谓的“肌肉记忆”，而且有些人是从其他桌面环境（甚至是 Windows）迁移过来的。

尽管 Elementary 没有为你提供这个默认设置，你仍然可以启用它。下面是方法。

启用最小化最大化按钮 - elementary OS

打开终端，安装添加 PPA 所需的 software-properties-common 软件包。默认情况下，这个包在 elementary OS 中没有安装（不要问我为什么，真的）。

sudo apt install software-properties-common


elementary OS 6 Odin

elementary Tweak 工具被重新换了个名字，它现在被称为 Pantheon Tweaks，并正在单独开发中。使用以下命令，你可以安装它：

sudo add-apt-repository -y ppa:philip.scott/pantheon-tweaks
sudo apt install -y pantheon-tweaks


elementary OS 5 Juno 及更低版本

如果你使用的是 elementary OS 5 June 及更低版本，你可以使用相同的 PPA 安装早期的 elementary-tweaks。在终端按照以下命令进行操作：

sudo add-apt-repository -y ppa:philip.scott/elementary-tweaks
sudo apt install -y elementary-tweaks


更改设置



安装后，点击顶部栏的“应用Application”，打开“系统设置System settings”。在系统设置窗口中，点击“个人Personal”下的 “Tweaks”。



在 Tweaks 窗口中，进入“外观Appearance”。



在窗口控制下，选择布局：“Windows”。





然后在顶部窗口栏的右侧应该有最小化、最大化和关闭按钮了。



也有其他组合形式，如 Ubuntu、macOS 等。你可以选择任何你觉得合适的：



这篇指南至此就结束了。系统设置中还有其他选项，你可以尝试使用，但窗口管理器 gala 最近删除了这些选项。因此，它们目前可能无法工作。

我希望这个指南能帮助你启用 elementary OS 的最小化最大化按钮。如果你需要任何帮助，请在下面的评论栏告诉我。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[几乎所有的事情都可以从 Linux 命令行完成，包括对 Xfce4 进行远程配置。




与专有操作系统相比，我很欣赏 Linux 的一个特点是，几乎所有的东西都可以从命令行中进行管理和配置。意味着几乎所有的事情都可以在本地或者通过 SSH 远程登录进行管理。虽然有时候需要花费一点时间在互联网上搜索，但是你能想到的任务，是有可能从命令行完成的。

问题

有时候需要使用命令行对桌面进行远程配置。在这种特殊情况下，我需要响应远程用户的请求将在 Xfce 控制板上的工作区从四个减少到三个。这种配置只需要在互联网上搜索约 20 分钟就找到了。

xfwm4 的默认工作区数量和许多其他设置可以在 /usr/share/xfwm4/defaults 这个文件中找到和修改。因此将 workspace_count=2 设置为 workspace_count=4 就改变了主机上所有用户的默认值。同时，非 root 用户可以执行 xfconf-query 命令来查询和设置 xfwm4 窗口管理器的各种属性。它应该由需要改变设置的用户使用，而不是由 root 使用。

在下面的例子中，首先我验证了当前工作区数量为 4 ，然后将数量改为 2，最后确认了新设置。

[user@test1 ~]# xfconf-query -c xfwm4 -p /general/workspace_count
4
[user@test1 ~]# xfconf-query -c xfwm4 -p /general/workspace_count -s 2
[user@test1 ~]# xfconf-query -c xfwm4 -p /general/workspace_count
2
[user@test1 ~]#


此更改会立即生效，用户可以马上看到，无需重新启动，甚至无需注…]]></summary>

22.05 has been released; this is the "developer edition" of the
Collabora Online offering formerly known as LibreOffice Online.


	CODE 22.05 is preceding the next major release of our long-term
	supported business suite Collabora Online. This free developer
	version includes all features and enhancements that will be
	available in our enterprise version, expected later in July. The
	CODE releases allow every interested user to learn and test new
	features on an early stage.


New features include support for external grammar checkers, the ability to
have 16,000 columns in a spreadsheet (which is evidently useful to
somebody), sparkline plots, support for WebP graphics, and more.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi folks, I've been experimenting with ways to teach people how to write better for a few years. During this time, I've worked in finance, sales, and software -- and everywhere I went, most people didn't write effectively, even when their job depended on it!
Learning how to become a better writer is generally not fun...books, lectures, and videos are passive and boring and tedious. Getting feedback from real people is generally most effective, but difficult and time-consuming.
Brevity 500 is my attempt at creating a learning experience that is active, engaging, and NOT tedious. It offers static human-generated advice along with real human feedback for paid users.
So far, in early testing, the games seem to appeal most to marketers and salespeople, but as a technical writer and developer myself, I think these games can help anyone build a strong foundation to become better at any kind of non-fiction writing.
Try it out and let me know what you think!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Vim 9.0 发布，带来了百倍速度新脚本语言

Vim 迎来了两年来的首个重大更新，在这个版本中除了若干变化外，还带来了一个新的脚本语言 Vim9 脚本。Vim9 脚本的目标是极大地提升性能，可带来一到两个数量级（10~100 倍）的执行速度提升；其次是避免 Vim 特有的结构，使之更接近于常用的编程语言，如 JavaScript、TypeScript 和 Java 等。不过，虽然 Vim9 和 Vim 之前支持的脚本语言存在一些不兼容，但旧的脚本仍然可以继续工作，不会像 Python 2 那样。


消息来源：Vim



老王点评：虽然是非常古老甚至古怪的编辑器，但是可喜的是 Vim 依然与时俱进，甚至还可能发展出一门通用的脚本语言来！




有人正在使用深度伪造来申请远程工作

美国联邦调查局表示已收到多起投诉，称有人利用窃取的信息和深度伪造的视频和语音来申请远程技术工作。这些视频、图像或录音被篡改成看起来和听起来像别人的，这些伪造者还使用偷来的他人身份信息来申请 IT、编程、数据库和软件公司的工作。不过，一些比较业余的深度伪造技术没有能及时跟上伪造者的咳嗽和打喷嚏，因而出现了一些穿帮镜头。目前还不清楚在这些虚假的工作尝试中，有多少是成功的，有多少是被发现并被举报的。


消息来源：gizmodo



老王点评：这真是新技术的“新用途”，这些远程工作者盯上的不只是公司的薪水，可能还有公司的机密信息。




Asahi Linux 开始着手为 M2 带来 Linux 支持

Asahi Linux 一直在努力将“苹果硅”芯片支持拉入 Linux 生态。最近他们收到了一台 13 英寸的 2022 款 MacBook Pro，开始着手为 M2 带来 Linux 支持。幸运的是，为 M1 编写的大部分 Linux 代码，都可在 M2 上无缝运行。当然，要让 M2 Mac 完美运行 Linux，还得再编写一些新的驱动程序。


消息来源：Phoronix



老王点评：光靠着开源社区反向工程做到这个程度已属难得，而这个过程中，苹果公司就静静的看着。]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[早在 2009 年，Minecraft 就来到了这个世界。从那时起，它已经成为一种文化现象。在这段时间里，一些开发者发布了具有类似想法和机制的开源游戏。今天，我们将看看其中最大的一个：Minetest。

什么是 Minetest？



Minetest，简单地说，是一个基于体素voxel的沙盒游戏，与 Minecraft 非常相似。与 Minecraft 不同的是，Minetest 是用 C++ 编写的，并被设计成可以在大多数系统上原生运行。它也有一个非常大的地图区域。地图大小为 “62,000 × 62,000 × 62,000 块”，“你可以向下开采 31,000 块，或向上建造 31,000 块”。

有趣的是，Minetest 最初是以专有许可证发布的，但后来被重新授权为 GPL。此后，它又被重新授权为 LGPL。

Minetest 有几种模式。你可以建造并发挥创意，或者你可以尝试在各种元素中生存。你并不局限于这些模式。Minetest 有大量的 额外内容，包括 模组mod、纹理包和在 Minetest 中建立的游戏。这主要是通过 Minetest 的 模组 API 和 Lua 完成的。



对于那些玩过 Minecraft 的人来说，你会发现 Minetest 中的体验非常相似。你可以挖掘资源，建造结构，并结合材料来制作工具。我在 Minetest 中没有注意到的一件事是怪物。我认为 Minetest 中没有任何生物，但话说回来，我只在创意模式中玩过。我还没有玩过生存模式。

Minetest 也被用于 教育。例如，瑞士 CERN 的人用 Minetest 创造了一个游戏，以 展示互联网是如何工作的 以及它是如何被创造出来的。Minetest 还被用于 教授 编程、地球科学以及微积分和三角学。



如何安装 Minetest?

Minetest 几乎在每个系统上都可以使用。下面是一个命令列表，你可以用它来在一些最流行的 Linux 发行版中安装 Minetest。

Ubuntu 或者 Debian

如果你有一个基于 Ubuntu 或 Debian 的发行版，只要在终端输入这个命令：

sudo apt install mintest


Arch 或者 Manjaro

对于基于 Arch 的系统（如 Manjaro），使用：

sudo pacman -S minetest


Fedora

你可以从 Fedora 服务器中输入以下命令安装 Mintest：

sudo dnf install mintest


openSUSE

openSUSE 用户可以用这个命令安装 Minetest：

sudo zypper in mintest


FreeBSD

FreeBSD 用户很幸运。他们可以用这个命令安装 Mintest：

pkg install minetest minetest_game


Snap

要安装 Minetest 的 Snap 包，请在终端输入以下命令：

sudo snap install minetest


Flathub

要安装，请输入：

flatpak install flathub net.minetest.Minetest


你可以在 这里 下载 Windows 的可移植执行文件。你也可以在 Android 上安装 Minetest，可以通过 Google Play 或 下载 APK。

总结



我已经在 Minetest 中花了几个小时在我的本地系统上进行构建和探索。它非常有趣。我还没来得及尝试任何额外的内容，因为我对我玩过的相对较少的游戏部分非常满意。我遇到的唯一麻烦是，由于某种原因，它在 Fedora 上运行缓慢。我可能存在一些配置上的错误。

如果你曾经认为 Minecraft 看起来很有趣，但不想花钱，那就去看看 Minetest。你会很高兴你这么做。

如果你玩过 Minetest，在评论中告诉我们你的体验如何。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[将你的大任务分为小步骤，避免自己不堪重负。




本周开始，我先回顾我的日程安排，看看我需要或想要完成的事情。通常，列表上有些较大的项目。无论来自工作上的问题，还是一系列关于生产力的文章，或者改进我家的鸡舍，当作为一项工作时，这个任务真的很艰巨。很有可能我无法坐下来，在一个时间段内，甚至在一天内完成类似（请注意，只是举例）21 篇文章之类的事情。



21 天的生产力 (Kevin Sonney, CC BY-SA 4.0)

所以当我的清单上有这样的东西时，我做的第一件事就是把它分解成更小的部分。如著名的诺贝尔文学奖得主 William Faulkner 说的“移山的人，从小石头开始。”（LCTT 译注：感觉与“千里之行，始于足下”是一个意思） 我们要解决大任务（山）并且需要完成各个步骤（小石头）。

我使用下面的步骤将大任务分割为小步骤：


我通常很清楚完成一项任务需要做什么。如果没有，我会做一些研究来弄清楚这一点。

我会顺序的写下完成的步骤。

最后，我坐下来拿着我的日历和清单，开始将任务分散到几天（或几周或几个月），以了解我何时可以完成它。


现在我不仅有计划，还知道多久能完成。逐步完成，我可以看到这项大任务不仅变得更小，而且更接近完成。

军队有句古话，“遇敌无计”。 几乎可以肯定的是，有一两点（或五点）我意识到像“截屏”这样简单的事情需要扩展到更复杂的事情。事实上，在 Easy!Appointments 的截图中，竟然是：


安装和配置 Easy!Appointments

安装和配置 Easy!Appointments WordPress 插件

生成 API 密钥来同步日历

截屏


即便如此，我也不得不将这些任务分解成更小的部分——下载软件、配置 NGINX、验证安装……你明白了吧。没关系。一个计划或一组任务不是一成不变的，可以根据需要进行更改。



今年的计划已经完成了 2/3 ! (Kevin Sonney, CC BY-SA 4.0)

这是一项后天习得的技能，最初几次需要一些努力。学习如何将大任务分解成更小的步骤可以让您跟踪实现目标或完成大任务的进度，而不会在过程中不知所措。

 来源：澎湃新闻
                
今年年初，友人宋希於转来中央民族大学（简称民大，即原中央民族学院，简称民院）官方微博在2020年1月3日发布的一条消息，其中说到佛学家韩镜清（1912-2003）的家人向民大图书馆捐赠图书之事。通过进一步检索，我发现民大新闻网于2020年1月2日也报道过这件事（网址：https://news.muc.edu.cn/info/1013/17422.htm），文字还要更加详细些：

校图书馆接受原中国社会科学院世界宗教所副研究员韩镜清先生家人捐赠图书

新闻网讯　12月16日，我校图书馆接受原中国社会科学院世界宗教所副研究员韩镜清先生家人捐赠图书1116种4312册。

韩镜清先生1912年10月出生于山西沁县，1932年考入北京大学哲学系，1949年起在北京大学东方语言文学系研究藏语，1952创建中央民族学院时调到少数民族语文系藏语教研组，1950至1953年和1956至1957年先后参加中国科学院西藏科学工作队语言组和民族语言调查工作队两次入藏进行语言调查和编写藏语讲义，1965年调到中国社会科学院新组建的世界宗教研究所，1977年元月病退。

此次获赠的图书不仅数量多，收藏和研究价值也颇高，如藏文《大藏经》216函、《大乘密严经》、《摄大乘论》、以及韩镜清夫人的手抄藏经书等珍贵图书文献，丰富和补充了学校图书馆馆藏资源，为相关领域学者进行研究提供了重要的文献支撑。

我校图书馆常年接受本校师生、校友及社会各界人士捐赠的图书，热诚地希望有更多的单位和个人将自己的著作或藏书捐赠给图书馆，让更多的读者能够共享这些宝贵的知识资源。

报道所附照片中的韩氏家人代表是韩镜清的女儿韩念群（韩镜清有二女，长女名念慈，念群为次女）。关于这次捐书活动举行的时间，报道中只记了月日（12月16日），没写年代。从消息发布于2020年年初来看…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Apache Kafka 是最流行的开源消息代理之一。它已经成为了大数据操作的重要组成部分，你能够在几乎所有的微服务环境中找到它。本文对 Apache Kafka 进行了简要介绍，并提供了一个案例来展示它的使用方式。




你有没有想过，电子商务平台是如何在处理巨大的流量时，做到不会卡顿的呢？有没有想过，OTT 平台是如何在同时向数百万用户交付内容时，做到平稳运行的呢？其实，关键就在于它们的分布式架构。

采用分布式架构设计的系统由多个功能组件组成。这些功能组件通常分布在多个机器上，它们通过网络，异步地交换消息，从而实现相互协作。正是由于异步消息的存在，组件之间才能实现可伸缩、无阻塞的通信，整个系统才能够平稳运行。

异步消息

异步消息的常见特性有：


消息的生产者producer和消费者consumer都不知道彼此的存在。它们在不知道对方的情况下，加入和离开系统。

消息代理broker充当了生产者和消费者之间的中介。

生产者把每条消息，都与一个“主题topic”相关联。主题是一个简单的字符串。

生产者可以在多个主题上发送消息，不同的生产者也可以在同一主题上发送消息。

消费者向代理订阅一个或多个主题的消息。

生产者只将消息发送给代理，而不发送给消费者。

代理会把消息发送给订阅该主题的所有消费者。

代理将消息传递给针对该主题注册的所有消费者。

生产者并不期望得到消费者的任何回应。换句话说，生产者和消费者不会相互阻塞。


市场上的消息代理有很多，而 Apache Kafka 是其中最受欢迎的之一。

Apache Kafka

Apache Kafka 是一个支持流式处理的、开源的分布式消息系统，它由 Apache 软件基金会开发。在架构上，它是多个代理组成的集群，这些代理间通过 Apache ZooKeeper …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello /r/linux,
 I have a little issue with choosing my desktop environment on my computer. I actually tried all the popular desktop environments existing for linux. The only desktop environments I like so far are gnome and kde (not because they are the most popular).
 My problem is that I continually change between them. For example: I see a news post about KDE and want to switch to KDE... vice versa.
 I really can't decide which desktop environment I want to be loyal to. Probably some of you will tell me that this is the good part of FOSS and that I am free to switch between them ... but at this rate I will never get comfortable with one of them.
 How did you learn which desktop environment fits to your demand? I am struggling with this step more than I thought.
 ​
 (sorry for my english.. not good at writing such a text)
 ​
 *edit: Don't take "loyal" so serious. I just want to say that I also want to contribute and help it to get better <3

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello!
 I recently released a new version of term-image. It's a Python package including a library, a CLI and a TUI for displaying and viewing/browsing images within a terminal.
 It currently supports a whole lot of features including:
  
Extensive API
 Kitty graphics support
 iTerm2 inline image support
 Support for PIL images, file paths, URLS
 Animations (even transparent ones)
 Browsing image directories recursively
 Automatic terminal support detection
  
Displaying an image can be as simple as
 from term_image.image import from_file image = from_file("path/to/image") image.draw() # OR print(image) 
 with python, or
 $ term-image path/to/image 
 from a shell, and as extensive as possible...
 Links:

 PyPI
 Docs
 Gallery
  
A screenshot of the TUI
 The project is open to contributions and I welcome everyone with knowledge and/or experience that could benefit the project.
 Thank you very much!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Version 9.0 of the Vim text
editor has been released.  The biggest change would appear to be the
addition of the "Vim9 Script" language for editor customization:



	The main goal of Vim9 script is to drastically improve
	performance. This is accomplished by compiling commands into
	instructions that can be efficiently executed. An increase in
	execution speed of 10 to 100 times can be expected.
	
	A secondary goal is to avoid Vim-specific constructs and get closer
	to commonly used programming languages, such as JavaScript,
	TypeScript and Java.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It is honestly kind of ridiculous. I have been using Linux for over three years, and during that time, Gnome Software (and the default ubuntu software app) has never worked reliably. I have used many different machines and distros, but gnome software has always been a buggy mess. I simply do not see how over three years, NOBODY at gnome has tried to fix this critical piece of software. Instead, they have just focused on making it look pretty, not useful. Having a working GUI for package management is a basic feature, and is necessary for those beginning to use Linux. It provides a user-friendly way to install and discover new packages without using a command-line interface. It makes a terrible first impression for Linux if when a new user wants to install a package, their app store just doesn't load. How is nobody talking about this? Whenever get somebody new set up on Linux, I always install KDE discover because it works perfectly, but I would imagine many new users would not know to do this. Gnome/Ubuntu software is a critical application for new users, and it's current performance is unacceptable.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've been working on building "the fastest news website" for a few reasons:
1. I got tired of waiting for news websites to load, so I made a text-only news website that only has major news headlines.
2. I wanted to demonstrate to the world that if you want to build something really fast on the web, you can do it without loads of JavaScript.
3. I wanted to show that you can design something that looks good without having tons of images, etc.
I put together the speed page at https://legiblenews.com/speed to hold my website to be more accountable for speed, but it's also interesting to see how fast other news websites are (or in most cases, are not).
Some feedback I'm interested in receiving:
1. What's your take both on the speed ranking methodology for Legible News?
2. Are my descriptions of the metrics for a non-web developer reasonable? Example of that at https://legiblenews.com/speed/websites/associated-press, and if you click through the links on that table, you see a description like https://legiblenews.com/speed/audits/cumulative-layout-shift
Sorry ahead of time, but I can't fit all news websites on the speed report. I had to target general news websites, not ones for specific niches like HN for Tech. If there's something you think that's missing please post it, but I can't promise that I'll add it.
If you like it, please consider subscribing! Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If we want people to be using linux instead of Windows or Mac OS we shouldn't make people think it's something that YOU need to put effort into understanding and belittle people who like linux but wouldn't be able to code up the entire frickin kernel and a window manager as "beginners". It creates the feeling that just using it isn't enough and that you can be "good at linux" when in reality it should be doing as much as possible for the user.
 You all made excellent points so here is my view on the topic now:
 A user friendly distro should be the norm. It should be self explanatory and easy to learn. Many are. Calling them "Beginner distros" creates the impression that they are an entry point for learning the intricacies of linux. For many they are just an OS they wanna use cause the others are crap. Most people won't want to learn Linux and just use it. If you want to be more specific call it "casual user friendly" as someone suggested. Btw I get that "you can't learn Linux" was dumb you can stop commenting abt it

第一颗使用树莓派 Zero W 作为飞行计算机的迷你卫星于 5 月重新进入地球大气层，在太空中完成了创纪录的 117 天。这颗卫星于 2022 年 1 月从国际空间站部署，是由美国犹他州立大学的大学生们开发的。它是一个立方体模块，尺寸只有 10 厘米见方，使用现成的组件建造。这颗卫星 80% 以上的软件是用 Python 编写的，并且有个装置检查其“心跳”，如果出现问题就重启解决，事实证明“重启试试”在太空同样有效。其主要目的是测试一个实验性的充气稳定系统，成功地证明了小型航天器可以在轨道上自我稳定。

老王点评：看来放个卫星也没什么难的，希望以后我们自己的空间站上也可以让同学们制造卫星放出去。




微软的内部 Linux 发行版支持内核实时补丁

上个月，微软发布了 CBL-Mariner 2.0 的第一个生产版本，这个微软内部的 Linux 发行版，用于支持从微软 Azure 到 WSL 用例等服务。CBL-Mariner 2.0 上周末进行了一次相当大的月度更新，增加了 Kpatch 以支持内核补丁，以及为内核启用实时补丁。


消息来源：Phoronix



老王点评：我感觉微软的这个内部发行版不声不响的也发展的挺快，真有一天抢了后 CentOS 市场，我觉得也不会太吃惊。




刚刚发布的 OpenSSL 3.0.4 可能存在一个比心脏流血更严重的漏洞

6 月 21 日发布的 OpenSSL 3.0.4 是为了解决一个命令注入漏洞，该漏洞在之前的补丁中没有完全解决。但这个版本本身需要进一步修复，安全研究人员称，它“容易受到远程内存损坏的影响，攻击者可以轻而易举地触发它”，可以被利用来在其中一台设备上运行任意的恶意代码。如果这个缺陷可以被远程利用（现在还不确定），它可能比心脏流血漏洞更严重。好消息是这个漏洞只影响英特尔 2016 年至 2022 年初发布的带有 AVX512 的某些 x64 芯片。


消息来源：The Register



老王点评：虽然可能影响面有限，但是一旦发布新的版本就赶快升级吧。]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When you add a PPA to your system, for example let's use ondrej/php PPA by following the on-page instructions to run add-apt-repository ppa:ondrej/php, you will run into two issues:
  
The repository uses a GPG key for signing using RSA1024, which is an encryption that has been disallowed by organizations such as NIST for nearly a decade
 The repository was added using HTTP
  
This means that:
  
A motivated attacker could have put malware into a package and signed it themselves
 Anyone could have sent you any malicious package they wanted, which if one was capable of exploiting a bug in the package manager, they could take over your system. This issue has happened in the past already.
  
So how does this happen?
  
Launchpad allows you to use RSA1024 keys, the issue for that has been open since 2015
 add-apt-repository uses HTTP instead of HTTPS - this was fixed in the latest version 22.04, but not backported to older versions.
  
But ondrej/php is very popular, why doesn't the packager simply switch to better encryption? They can't, you cannot change to another key for your PPA.
 This is yet another very old issue open since 2014.
 This actually brings us to the third issue that builds up on top of the first issue.
 Even if strong encryption was used, if author's GPG key was compromised, they are not capable of replacing it for another one without also having to use a new URL, thus essentially having to create a new repository when they want to change the key.
 I hope that Canonical stops treating security issues with such low priority, especially with how common it is to be adding PPAs on Ubuntu and Ubuntu-based systems.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Zeek 是一个开源的网络安全监控工具。本文讨论了如何将 Zeek 与 ELK 集成。




在本杂志 2022 年 3 月版发表的题为“用 Zeek 轻松实现网络安全监控”的文章中，我们研究了 Zeek 的功能，并学习了如何开始使用它。现在我们将把我们的学习经验再进一步，看看如何将其与 ELK（即 Elasticsearch、Kibana、Beats 和 Logstash）整合。

为此，我们将使用一个叫做 Filebeat 的工具，它可以监控、收集并转发日志到 Elasticsearch。我们将把 Filebeat 和 Zeek 配置在一起，这样后者收集的数据将被转发并集中到我们的 Kibana 仪表盘上。

安装 Filebeat

让我们首先将 Filebeat 与 Zeek 安装在一起。使用 apt 来安装 Filebeat，使用以下命令：

sudo apt install filebeat


接下来，我们需要配置 .yml 文件，它位于 /etc/filebeat/ 文件夹中：

sudo nano /etc/filebeat/filebeat.yml


我们只需要在这里配置两件事。在 Filebeat 输入部分，将类型改为 log，并取消对 enabled:false 的注释，将其改为 true。我们还需要指定存储日志的路径，也就是说，我们需要指定 /opt/zeek/logs/current/*.log。

完成这些后，设置的第一部分应该类似于图 1 所示的内容。



第二件要修改的事情是在输出下的 Elasticsearch 输出部分，取消对 output.elasticsearch 和 hosts 的注释。确保主机的 URL 和端口号与你安装 ELK 时配置的相似。我们把它保持为 localhost，端口号为 92…]]></summary>

浏览网页可能占了你一天中的大部分时间。然而，你总是需要手动浏览，这很讨厌，不是吗？你必须打开浏览器，然后访问一个网站，单击按钮，移动鼠标……相当费时费力。如果能够通过代码与互联网交互，岂不是更好吗？

在 Python 的 requests 模块的帮助下，你可以使用 Python 从互联网中获取数据：

import requests

DATA = "https://opensource.com/article/22/5/document-source-code-doxygen-linux"
PAGE = requests.get(DATA)

print(PAGE.text)


在以上代码示例中，你首先导入了 requests 模块。接着，你创建了两个变量：其中一个叫做 DATA，它用来保存你要下载的 URL。在之后的代码中，你将能够在每次运行应用程序时提供不同的 URL。不过，就目前而言，最简单的方法是“硬编码”一个测试 URL，以达到演示目的。

另一个变量是 PAGE。代码读取了存储在 DATA 中的 URL，然后把它作为参数传入 requests.get 函数，最后用变量 PAGE 来接收函数的返回值。requests 模块及其 .get 函数的功能是：“读取”一个互联网地址（一个 URL）、访问互联网，并下载位于该地址的任何内容。

当然，其中涉及到很多步骤。幸运的是，你不必自己弄清楚，这也正是 Python 模块存在的原因。最后，你告诉 Python 打印 requests.get 存储在 PAGE 变量的 .text 字段中的所有内容。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[这会成为放弃基于 Chromium 的浏览器并开始使用 Firefox 的一个理由吗？也许吧，决定权在你。




即使你有了所有的隐私扩展和各种保护功能，别人仍然有方法可以识别你或跟踪你。

请注意，并非所有浏览器都是如此，本文中，我们主要关注基于 Chromium 的浏览器，并将谷歌 Chrome 作为“主要嫌疑人”。

以前，在 Chromium 浏览器上，尽管别人已经能够检测到你已安装的扩展程序，但许多扩展程序都实施了某些保护措施来防止这种检测。

然而，一位名为 “z0ccc” 的安全研究人员发现了一种检测已安装 Chrome 浏览器扩展程序的新方法，该方法可进一步用于通过“浏览器指纹识别”来跟踪你。

如果你还不知道的话：浏览器指纹识别Browser Fingerprinting是指收集有关你的设备/浏览器的各种信息，以创建唯一的指纹 ID（哈希），从而在互联网上识别你的一种跟踪方法。“各种信息”包括：浏览器名称、版本、操作系统、已安装的扩展程序、屏幕分辨率和类似的技术数据。

这听起来像是一种无害的数据收集技术，但可以使用这种跟踪方法在线跟踪你。

检测谷歌 Chrome 扩展

研究人员发布了一个开源项目 “Extension Fingerprints”，你可以使用它来测试你安装的 Chrome 扩展是否能被检测到。

新技术涉及一种“时间差”方法，该工具比较了扩展程序获取资源的时间。与浏览器上未安装的其他扩展相比，受保护的扩展需要更多时间来获取资源。因此，这有助于从 1000 多个扩展列表中识别出一些扩展。

关键是：即使有了各种新的进步和技术来防止跟踪，Chrome 网上应用店的扩展也可以被检测到。



并且，在检测到已安装的扩展程序后，别人可以就使用浏览器指纹识别，对你进行在线跟踪。

令人惊讶的是，即使你安装有 uBlocker、AdBlocker、或 Privacy Badger（一些流行的以隐私为重点的扩展程序）之类的扩展程序，使用了这种方法，它们也都可以被检测到。

你可以在它的 GitHub 页面 上查看所有技术细节。如果你想自己测试它，请前往它的 扩展指纹识别网站 自行检查。

拯救 Firefox？

嗯，似乎是的，毕竟我出于各种原因，不断回到 Firefox。

这个新发现的（跟踪）方法应该适用于所有基于 Chromium 的浏览器。我在 Brave 和谷歌 Chrome 上都测试了这个方法。研究人员还提到，该工具不能在使用微软应用商店中的扩展的微软 Edge 上工作。但是，相同的跟踪方法仍然有效。

正如研究人员指出，Mozilla Firefox 可以避免这种情况，因为每个浏览器实例的扩展 ID 都是唯一的。

一、穆时英首度赴日之行的缘起

穆时英的首度赴日之行，究竟以何缘由、契机而发生？据兴亚院华中连络部调查官增谷达之辅致今日出海一信（1940年7月2日）、松崎启次《上海人文记：电影制片人手记》可知，乃由兴亚院华中连络部所组织。兴亚院设立于1938年12月16日，主席由日本首相担任，各部职务亦由日本政府高官出任，专事对华关系。次年3月10日在中国境内分别成立华北、蒙疆、华中、厦门连络部。其中，华北连络部驻地则在北京，一度扮演着大使馆一般的角色；华中连络部设址上海，起初规模较小，后设官房（办公室）及政务、文化、经一、经二、经三局，人员亦随之扩充数倍。1942年11月1日大东亚省成立前一日，兴亚院旋遭裁撤，改组为中国事务局。

但增谷并未出现在兴亚院华中连络部成立时公布的主要官员名单、1941年6月1日印刷出版的《兴亚院职员录》之中，至于其何时调入、任职时限（似较短暂）等，俱有待考证。不过，在其所服务的华中连络部完成的近五百种秘密调查报告（尚不计由其指导成立的中支那调查机关联合会、中支建设资料整备委员会，所完成的数百种以各地经济情况为主的调查报告）之中，确乎有不少关于上海电影、戏剧业的专门调查，如第二辑之一《现在上海并奥地活跃中之新剧界主要人物表》、第二辑之二《奥地戏剧运…]]></summary>

 Some days ago I bought the Asus Rog Zephyrus 2022 with alder lake and RTX 3050. 
 All this I tested in Arch Linux, I do not know the rest of distros. Also the tools to control the dGPU and others only works with systemd (I'm a OpenRC user but OpenRC do not support sockets and because of that SystemD is a requeriment).
 First, known issues that for now I do not know how to fix:
  
The notebook have 4 speakers: two for basses and two treble. I use pipewire but when use the keyboard to reduce the volume, only works with treble, if I want reduce the volume properly I must do trough pavucontrol.
 I think this issue is because the Realtek Audio Driver (if you are a Linux user, maybe you know this).

 I'm trying to stay away from rdesktop until they get maintainers for the project (the previous crew left in 2019 and I haven't heard of a replacement). No major updates or CVEs have been published as of late, which may indicate that the project hasn't gotten much help since.
 I generally enjoy CLI applications just for ease of use, so common GUI clients like Remmina are generally out of the picture.
 Suggestions?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello people, 
 Recently I've been thinking about how so many things that you wouldn't guess at first, actually run on linux, which got me thinking, that infotainment systems on our cars probably run some kind of linux software...
 And in that case, how is it not common to hear about people running their own "SO" in their car?
 Does anyone have any sort of information on this?
 In case you do, do people usually run into trouble because of sensor compatibility and stuff?
 I'm asking because i've thought about getting an aftermarket system for my car, but i'm scared that things like multi function buttons on the steering wheel, and info like fuel consumption, not to mention security systems like TC and ABS, could stop working for lack of compatibility.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This is a guide to setting up zswap on Linux-based operating systems. What is zswap and why should you use it? Zswap is a way of giving your computer additional virtual memory, like increasing your RAM. It is very useful for systems with low RAM (< 8 GB) and quite useful even for systems with more RAM. This guide will show you how to setup zswap with the lz4 compression algorithm, which is very fast. But first, to answer some questions.
 Warning for BTRFS users: BTRFS does not support swap, use ZRAM instead.
 Does this come with a performance penalty?
 There is no such thing as free lunch – compressing and decompressing pages in virtual memory will tax your CPU. However, using compressed memory is faster than swapping to an SSD, and orders of magnitude faster than swapping to a spinning ha…]]></summary>

	This second year since the RFC we are looking forward to several

    More users or use cases inside the kernel, including example drivers – this is pretty important to get merged into the kernel.
    Splitting the kernel crate and managing dependencies to allow better development.
    Extending the current integration of the kernel documentation, testing and other tools.
    Getting more subsystem maintainers, companies and researchers involved.
    Seeing most of the remaining Rust features stabilized.
    Possibly being able to start compiling the Rust code in the kernel with GCC.
    And, of course, getting merged into the mainline kernel, which
should make everything else easier!]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey, fellas!
 I'm trying to switch my career from a non-IT self-employed role where I was doing a little bit of everything (mostly managing and operations) to an IT role. My goal is to get hired as a junior DevOps/SRE. I had an interview already that exposed the lack of my hard skills. I know that working in a Linux environment is only a part of what DevOps/SRE engineers do. I'll get to automation, cloud services, containerization, Python etc later. First, I'd like to learn Linux because it seems lots of things are based on the knowledge of Linux. My goal is to learn Linux fundamentals and get certificates that attract HR managers when they are looking at your resume.
 I started self-studying Linux using Udemy courses and VirtualBox with CentOS 9/Ubuntu. Today I'm going to try to pass the LPIC Essentials test at a local test center. I hope I can pass it. Currently, I'd like to continue studying Linux to get LPIC-1. But here is an issue: my friend who has an RHCE certificate advised me I should follow the RH certification path because in his experience he never saw LPIC requirements in any related available job listings.
 I like learning Linux and I find it's fun and of course challenging, but I'd like to focus on something that is definitely better when it comes to getting hired. As I mentioned above, Linux is the basis but I'll also need to learn many different things like Ansible, Docker, AWS, Python etc. I understand Red Hat is a major player in the enterprise world and they also acquired Ansible some time ago. Ansible was one of the things I was supposed to know during my interview. I see RH offers an extra Ansible-related certificate for those who have an RHCE certificate. So RH path indeed seems to be promising.
 I'd like to know your opinion about which path will get you hired faster - LPIC or RH?

Qt Creator 是 Qt 框架的默认集成开发环境（IDE），同时也是丰富的 Qt 库和用户之前的粘合剂。除了如智能代码补全、调试、项目管理等基础功能外，Qt Creator 还提供了很多让软件开发变得更简单的特性。

在这篇文章中，我会重点介绍一些我最喜欢的 Qt Creator 特性。

深色模式

当我使用一个新的应用时，我的第一个问题是：它有深色模式吗？ Qt Creator 的回答是：你更喜欢哪一种深色模式呢？

你可以在“选项Options”菜单中激活深色模式。在顶部的菜单栏中，点击“工具Tools”，选择“选项Options”，然后转到“环境Environment”部分。下面是你能选择的常用外观：



定制外观

像每一个 Qt 应用一样，借助样式表，Qt Creator 的外观是高度可定制化的。下面，你可以按照我的做法给 Qt Creator一个想要的外观。

将下面这些内容写入 mycustomstylesheet.css 文件中：

QMenuBar { background-color: olive }
QMenuBar::item { background-color: olive }
QMenu { background-color : beige; color : black }
QLabel { color: green }


然后使用命令行开启 Qt Creator，将样式表作为参数传入：

qtcreator -stylesheet=mycustomstylesheet.css


IDE 现在看上去应该会变成这样：

被誉为互联网之父的蒂姆-伯纳斯-李，他赞同 Web3 所宣称的“将数据从大科技公司转移到用户手中”的使命，但他采取了不同的途径来实现这一目标。他的 Solid 是用标准的网络工具和开放规范建立的。私人信息存储在被称为“豆荚”的去中心化数据存储中，用户可以在任何地方托管，可以选择哪些应用程序可以访问他们的数据。但他不认同区块链，“当你试图在区块链上建立这些东西时，根本不行。”虽然，他通过将其开发的第一个互联网网站做成 NFT 赚了 540 万美元。


消息来源：The Next Web



老王点评：我认为理想化的想将数据从互联网商业巨头手中拿回来，那是不行的，即便技术上可行，经济上也不可行。我看好区块链的是地方是，它是一种新的经济分配模型，一种新的生产力关系。




Rust 连续第七年成为开发者最喜欢的编程语言

Stack Overflow 发布了 2022 年的年度开发者调查报告，180 个国家的逾 7.3 万名开发者参与了调查。JavaScript 仍然是最常用的语言，其次是 HTML/CSS；Rust 连续第七年成为开发者最喜欢的编程语言；最喜欢的数据库是 PostgreSQL 和 Redis；开发者最常用的操作系统是 Windows，WSL 使用率从 2021 年的 3% 增加到了 14%；Neovim 和 VSCode 是最喜欢的 IDE；Git 是最常用的版本控制系统，占 93.87%；


消息来源：Stack Overflow



老王点评：虽然年年都有很多机构在发布各种程序员调查，但是仔细看看这份调查结果，你就会发现世界上的程序员们正在学习和使用什么，这对于国内程序员们来说，应该是一个有效的指引。




一些互联网史前遗迹仍然活着

根据一份研究数据，超过 1700 万美国人经常使用 MapQuest，这是最早的数字地图网站之一，它早就被谷歌和苹果超越了。而 Ask Jeeves，一个在谷歌之前就开始运行的网络搜索引擎，仍然有粉丝和人们在谷歌搜索中输入 “Ask Jeeves a question”。以及 AOL，仍然是美国前 50 个最受欢迎的网站。

老王点评：不过似乎中国的互联网遗迹们所剩不多了。有谁还记得四通利方、瀛海威？如今全不见踪影了。]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[6月27日，腾讯控股发布公告称，公司第一大股东Naspers（南非报业集团）将出售公司股份，Naspers集团预计每天出售的公司股份数目将占公司股份之每日平均成交量的一小部分。
　　公告具体内容显示：
　　公司主要股东Prosus（该公司由Naspers拥有大多数股权）及Naspers就其各自股本中的股份向Prosus及Naspers各自的公众股东开始进行一项长期、开放式的回购计划，并将有序地以场内出售Naspers集团所持公司股份的方式筹集回购计划所需资金。
　　据悉，Naspers集团预计每天出售的公司股份数目将占公司股份之每日平均成交量的一小部分。例如，若Naspers集团在过去三个月内在符合欧洲监管限制的前提下执行回购计划，每天出售的公司股份平均不会超过公司股份之每日平均成交量约3-5%。
　　公告发布后，腾讯控股午后跳水，一度转跌，此前涨超4%。
　　腾讯背后最大股东
　　资料显示，Prosus是一家控股公司，用来持有南非投资公司Naspers（跨国上市传媒集团）的国际互联网资产，是由Naspers分拆出来。
　　Naspers通过控股的Prosus子公司MIH TC Holdings Limited位居腾讯第一大股东，此后一直都是最大的股东。早在2001年，Naspers的子公司南非NIH购入腾讯46.5%股权时，作价仅3200万美元，此后所持股票价值一度高达3000多亿美元，赚了12000多倍。20年来，腾讯业务从QQ扩展至微信、广告以至网游，股价则由2004年在港交所挂牌的3.7港元，升至目前的近400港元。
　　截至目前，Prosus对腾讯的持股比例为28.8%，直接持股数量为27.7亿股。
　　作为腾讯主要股东，Prosus及Naspers曾在2018年和2021年进行过两次减持，并因此获得巨大回报。值得一提的是，南非报业集团虽然是第一大股东，但是没有实际的决策和领导权，因此长期只是参与分红。
　　据公开资料，受疫情等多重因素影响，Prosus及Naspers在全球范围的投资遭遇挑战，两家公司的二级市场市值也遭遇明显缩水。
　　该次减持与前两次不同的是，减持方式将由持续性少量减持推进。有分析师认为，这是Prosus和Naspers尝试在对腾讯影响最小化的基础上，尽最大可能缓解自身压力。
　　据公告，Naspers预计每天出售的腾讯股份数目平均不会超过腾讯日平均成交量的3-5%。
　　大股东减持对腾讯股价有着不小的影响。回溯历史，2018年3月，投资腾讯已达17年的Prosus首次减持腾讯，当时也是减持了2%，约1.9亿股。当时Naspers也承诺至少未来3年将不会进一步出售股份。在2018年减持消息传出后，腾讯的股价在接下来的6个月里几乎跌去了一半。
　　Naspers完成京东股份出售，总收益约36.7亿美元
　　今日Naspers还宣布，已在6月24日完成出售从腾讯处获得的京东股份，实现总收益约为36.7亿美元，此次出售不受任何先决条件的限制。
　　2021年12月底，腾讯曾发布公告，向其股东分配其持有京东集团约4.6亿股A类普通股。在此次分配中获得京东股份的腾讯股东将成为京东的新股东。
　　本次派息后，腾讯对京东持股比例由17%降至2.3%，不再为第一大股东，同时腾讯总裁刘炽平也卸任京东董事。通过此次股权分配，Prosus(Naspers拥有多数股权)通过其子公司MIH TC Holdings获得约京东股份的4%。

        <link href="https://linux.cn/article-14765-1.html?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss"/>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[键盘快捷键让我专注于我要传递的内容，而不是它的外观。




从我记事起，我就一直在使用文字处理软件。当文字处理器从直接格式化转向利用样式来改变文本在页面上的显示方式时，这对我的写作有很大的推动作用。

LibreOffice 提供了多种样式，你可以使用它们来创建各种内容。 LibreOffice 将段落样式应用于文本块，例如正文、列表和代码示例。字符样式类似，只是这些样式适用于段落内的内联词或其他短文本。使用“视图View -> 样式Styles”菜单，或使用 F11 键盘快捷键，调出样式选择器。



使用样式可以更轻松地编写更长的文档。看看这个例子：作为咨询实践的一部分，我写了很多工作簿和培训材料。一个工作簿可能有 40 或 60 页长，具体取决于主题，并且可以包含各种内容，例如正文、表格和列表。我的一些技术培训材料可能还包括源代码示例。

我有一个提供给客户的标准培训集，但我也做定制的培训计划。在处理自定义程序时，我可能会先从另一个工作簿导入文本，然后从那里开始工作。根据客户的不同，我可能还会调整字体和其他样式元素以匹配客户的样式偏好。对于其他材料，我可能需要添加源代码示例。

要使用直接格式输入示例源代码，我需要设置字体并调整工作簿中每个代码块的边距。如果我后来决定我的工作簿应该对正文文本或源代码示例使用不同的字体，我需要返回并更改所有内容。对于包含多个代码示例的工作簿，这可能需要几个小时来查找每个源代码示例并调整字体和边距以匹配新的首选格式。

但是，通过使用样式，我可以更新定义一次，为正文样式使用不同的字体，并且 LibreOffice Writer 会在所有使用正文样式的地方更新我的文档。同样，我可以调整预格式化文本样式的字体和边距，LibreOffice Writer 会将这种新样式应用到每个具有预格式化文本样式的源代码示例中。这对于其他文本块也是如此，包括标题、源代码、列表以及页眉和页脚。

我最近有了一个好主意，更新 LibreOffice 键盘快捷键以简化我的写作过程。我重新定义了 Ctrl + B 设置加粗强调字符样式，Ctrl + I 设置强调字符样式，Ctrl + 空格 设置取消字符样式。这使我的写作变得更加容易，因为我不必暂停写作，这样我就可以高亮显示一些文本并选择一种新的风格。相反，我可以使用新的 Ctrl + I 键盘快捷键来设置字符样式，它本质上是斜体文本。之后我输入的任何内容都使用强调样式，直到我按 Ctrl + 空格 将字符样式重置为默认的无字符样式。



如果你想自己设置的，请使用“工具Tools -> 自定义Customize”， 然后单击“键盘Keyboard”选项卡以修改键盘快捷键。



LibreOffice 通过样式使技术写作变得更加容易。通过利用键盘快捷键，我简化了我的写作方式，让我专注于我要交付的内容，而不是它的外观。稍后我可能会更改格式，但样式保持不变。

南方卑湿，春夏之交尤其如此。开卷之书，在湿度一次次无声的侵袭下，轻则发黄，重则变形扭曲，这是世间诸种无能为力之一。毕竟，这年头又流行容易发黄的轻型纸。新书到手，只好保持塑封，一本本“收藏”在那里，束书不观。

但好书，足以让这些规则失效。

《目加田诚北平日记》
《目加田诚北平日记》，九州大学中国文学会编，[日]静永健主编，凤凰出版社2022年2月出版，337页，88.00元
此书是日本著名中国文学学者目加田诚博士（1904-1994）1930年代在中国北平留学时的日记，历时约一年半（1933年10月至1935年3月），记载了他在中国学习、社交方面的经历，有很高的文化价值。一年半的留学时间不长，目加田诚的记载亦很简略，但1930年代的北平，特别是夹在1931年柳条湖事件与1937年卢沟桥事变中间的社会状态，在他笔下都有不少信息；他结交的人物，无论是文化名人如孙楷第、刘节、钱稻孙、胡适、周作人、杨树达、郁达夫、鲁迅，还是学汉语的师友奚、常、杜、赵、刘、俞等人，亦是如此。特别是后几个普通人，可以说是一个日本人对中国人（国民性）的了解样本，目加田诚和俞的告别（282页），亦可以看出当时中日两个普通人之间的感情。屡次出现在日记里、目加田诚非常牵挂的女儿顺子，八十六岁时为此书写的跋语中说“年轻时的父亲是有些洁癖的人”，质诸当时的交往，颇能看出目加田诚的性情。

出现在目加田诚笔下、与其同时期在北平留学的日本青年学者如小竹武夫、小川环树、滨一卫、桂太郎、山室三良、山本守、堤留吉等，在北平工作的如桥川时雄、石桥丑雄等，短期来访的如冈田武彦、楠本正继等，构成了当时在日本的学人群体，他们后来大都成为中国课题的研究者。

这部日记一直深藏，直到2012年才被发现（静永健《序言》），整理工作不是简单的释文，而是做了大量的编注，通过目加田…]]></summary>

《埃达·洛夫莱斯：史上第一位程序员》，[英]克里斯托弗·霍林斯、[英]厄休拉·马丁、[美]阿德里安·赖斯著，柯遵科、单雯译，商务印书馆2021年8月出版，147页，49.00元
提起程序员，你会想到什么？格子衫、框架眼镜和略显秃头的技术宅男，还是精致靓丽或是不修边幅的女性？大部分人脑海中的程序员是前者，这样的刻板印象早已深入人心。2022年3月，每日互动发布的《2022年女程序员人群洞察报告》显示，程序员中的女性占比仅为两成左右。这表明软件开发目前还是“男人的天下”。这样的现实，或许也会加固一些刻板印象：女生不适合学计算机、女生不适合当程序员、女程序员的技术实力比不上男性……

事实当然不是这样。要说女性不适合当程序员，有位大佬第一个不服：写下世界上第一个计算机程序的是她，第一个认识到计算机具有超越纯计算应用的人还是她。这就是软件行业的“祖师奶奶”，史上第一位程序员——埃达·拜伦。

家世与童年

埃达·洛夫莱斯（Ada Lovelace）婚前被称为拜伦小姐，她是著名诗人拜伦的女儿。或许你会好奇，这位大诗人的女儿，为什么会将理性的数学而非浪漫的文学作为毕生所爱？这还要从她的母亲说起，她的母亲安妮·伊莎贝拉·密尔班克出身于英国极其显赫的家庭，性格沉静，痴迷数学，拜伦还曾称妻子为“平行四边形公主”。遗憾的是，志趣迥异的两人没能维持长久的婚姻，安妮发现拜伦和他同父异母的妹妹奥格斯塔的不伦恋情后，再也无法忍受丈夫四处留情的恶习和喜怒无常的行为，她带着一个月大的女儿离家出走，回到娘家，不久之后便提出离婚。消息传开后，流言蜚语让拜伦一夜之间身败名裂，这位骄傲的诗人也因此离开了英国。此后，拜伦小姐一生都再未与这位大名鼎鼎的诗人父亲见上一面，甚至连他的画像都被藏了起来，等埃达成年后才看到。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[7-Zip 是用于 Windows、Mac 和 Linux 的知名开源文件归档器。它的最新版本 22.00 现已推出。它是 2022 年的第一个稳定版本。上一个版本是 21.07，于 2021 年 12 月发布。7-Zip 的用户可以从官方网站获取该应用的最新版本，下载适用于 Windows 64 位、32 位和 ARM 版本。该应用仍然与过时的 Windows 版本兼容，例如 XP 和 Vista。它还支持所有官方支持的 Windows 版本，包括服务器版本。适用于 Linux 的 7-Zip 22.00 已经可以下载，但 Mac OS 版本还不可用。

7-Zip 22.00 包含一些增强了应用功能的新特性。这个归档器现在支持提取苹果文件系统Apple File System（APFS）镜像。几年前，苹果公司在 Mac OS 10.13 和 iOS 中引入了苹果文件系统。该文件系统在设计时就考虑到了闪存（Flash）和固态硬盘（SSD）存储。

7-Zip 22.00 包括了对其 TAR 存档支持的多项增强。使用选项 -ttar -mm=pax 或 -ttar -mm=posix，7-Zip 现在可以创建符合 POSIX 标准的 tar 格式的 TAR 档案。此外，使用选项 ttar -mm=pax -mtp=3 -mtc -mta，7-Zip 可以在 tar/pax 存档中存储高精度的文件时间戳。

最后，Linux 用户可以在 TAR 归档文件中使用以下两个新选项：


snoi：将所有者/组 ID 保存在存档中，或将所有者/组 ID 从存档复制到提取的文件中。

snon：在存档中保留所有者/组的名称。


适用于 Windows 的 7-Zip 22.00 添加了对 -snz 选项的支持，该选项用于传播区识别符（LCTT 译注：区标识符是微软在 2013 年为 IE 设计的安全功能，它会标记那些用户自网络上所下载的文件，并在用户准备打开时跳出警告）。

要提取文件，请使用标识符流。出于安全目的，Windows 使用了该流，它可用于确定文件是在本地创建的还是从互联网下载的。

在“添加到存档add to archive”配置对话框中，7-Zip 22.00 包含一个新的选项窗口。它包括用于更改时间戳精度、更改其他与时间相关的配置选项，以及防止更改源文件的最后访问时间等选项。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[正如 Linus Torvalds 所暗示，Linux Kernel 5.20 发布时可能会提供对 Rust 的支持。你怎么看？




市面上已经有许多用 Rust 重写的开源项目。因此，如今 Rust 被认为是 Linux 内核的第二语言，也就不足为奇了。

几天前，在 Linux 基金会开源峰会 上，Linus Torvals 提到他们预计将在下一个内核版本（即 Linux 内核 5.20）中对 Rust 进行试验。

或许你不知道，正如 Phoronix 率先报道的那样，Linux 已经有了 Rust 内核补丁，包含了少量的示例驱动程序，以及基本的基础设施的启用代码。

因此，Linus Torvalds 对可能合并 Rust 支持的暗示，也不足为奇。但是，这无疑是令人兴奋的！

用于 Linux 内核的 Rust

这么做的最终目标是让 Linux 内核变得更好，但它现在仍然处于试运行阶段。

凭借其各种优势，Rust 正日益成为一种流行的编程语言。还记得吗，System76 也在开发一个用 Rust 编写的新桌面环境。

然而，并不是所有参与维护 Linux 内核的人都熟悉这种编程语言。

那么，这会是一个问题吗？

Linus Torvalds 并不认为这是一个大问题，因为内核中也有其他语言。他还提到希望看到 Rust 成为新的一份子。

The Register 报道称，Linus Torvalds 表示会信任维护者，除非他们犯了错误。

Linux 5.20：何时发布？

Linux 内核 5.19 版本将于 7 月底左右发布。因此，5.20 版本的合并窗口应该会在其稳定版发布后开启（假设没有意外延迟的话）。

除了 Rust 以外，Linux 内核 5.20 应该也是对包括 RDNA3 在内的下一代硬件支持的重要更新，它同时提供了更多功能。

你如何看待 Rust 将在不久的将来进入 Linux 呢？你感到兴奋吗？欢迎在下方评论区告诉我们～

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I gave it a shot. I really did. I made it about a month. 
 I've been using Linux in some form or another since I was introduced to Slackware in the late 90s. My field laptops both run Linux - Xubuntu and Kubuntu. I got tired of the crap that Microsoft calls Windows 11 and decided to try converting my gaming laptop to Linux. I had 2 requirements -
 1) Had to run Windows games via Wine (Pingus is great but not that great). 
 2) Absolutely had to be able to play Red Dead Redemption 2 (I know - it barely runs on Windows...) 
 I was unable to get the Epic Store version of rdr2 to work. I had better luck with the Steam version, which I obviously bought right before it went on sale. However, shortly after I entered Chapter 2, it began crashing repeatedly - and all of the tips on that are Windows specific. I finally got tired of trying. 
 I was able to get Sid Meiers Pirates to run fine. I got a couple of other games to work. I just could not, for the life of me, get RDR2 to run worth a crap - at least a functional crap like on Windows. 
 Sorry Linux - your gaming days are still in the future. I've already wiped and reinstalled Win10. I'll stick with that for a couple more years.

 I think I know my way around a lot of things in Linux. But then again, I have this feeling that my knowledge is superficial. I keep forgetting things and need to reread a lot of material every time I take a brake from a subject. Refresh my mind, if you will. It really bugs me because I feel like I have to work 10x as hard as other people do just to keep up.
 For example I wanted to know more about WiFi protocols so that I know what's happening when I use the aircrack-ng package. I started reading a book on 802.11 protocols and it went good for a while but suddenly I got lost. There's so much to know. So many acronyms.

Soon it became too much work to update the items in the HTML manually, so I added a JavaScript-based editor. It relies on a tiny Node.js server to write changes back to the HTML file.
Not as user-friendly as a "normal" web-based application, but it does mean we can keep the HTML file under version control and follow our normal development process for making/tracking changes.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[NetHack 被列入现代艺术博物馆藏品

NetHack 被列入了纽约现代艺术博物馆收藏。它被建筑和设计馆选定为其小型电子游戏收藏品，并作为今年秋天的“永不孤独”展览的一部分展出。NetHack 最初是 1982 年的地下城探索游戏“Hack”（它基于 1980 年的游戏 Rogue）的一个复刻版本，它影响了日后的《暗黑破坏神》和《火炬之光》。它是仍在活动的最古老的开源项目之一，实际上比“开源”一词（当时叫“自由软件”），甚至 GPL 都早了几年。它也是最早的，甚至是第一个完全通过互联网，由分布在世界各地的团队开发的软件项目之一（“NetHack”中的“Net”因此而来）。


消息来源：Linkedin



老王点评：“上古时代”的网游，这是真正的老游戏和开源鼻祖。它也有很多衍生版本，大家感兴趣的可以看看。




Linus Torvalds 反对用 -O3 优化编译内核

之前我们 报道 过，有开发者提出了补丁，可以在所有 CPU 架构上启用 -O3 的优化参数来编译内核，而之前该 Kconfig 参数只在 ARC 架构上可用。Linus Torvalds 对此的看法是，他实际上反对有这样一个 Kconfig 选项。他需要被一些真实的、现实世界的数据所说服，以显示其好处。当然，感兴趣的人即便没有这个 Kconfig 选项，也可以为编译器添加类似选项而做到 -O3 优化。但 Linus 也指出，“在生成糟糕的代码方面，-O3 有更多的黑历史。最好干脆移除这个选项。”


消息来源：Phoronix



老王点评：过度优化显然是个错误，Linus 和内核社区还是一如既往的保守持重。不过我觉得，作为实验性的选项，完全可以更开放一些，或许真的能对内核和编译器优化有所改进。




Fedora CoreOS 有望提升为官方版本

Fedora CoreOS 是一个自动更新、最小化的操作系统，用于容器工作负载，其目标是结合 CoreOS Container Linux 和 Fedora Atomic Host 的最佳特性。早在 Fedora 34 开发周期中，Fedora CoreOS 的开发者希望能够晋升为官方版本。现在反馈的问题已经得到解决，有望在 Fedora 37 中升级为和工作站、服务器和 IoT 构建并列的官方版本。


消息来源：Phoronix



老王点评：再加上这个容器版本，Fedora 的各个官方产品线就齐全了。]]></summary>

开源的 PDF 阅读和编辑工具通常比 &ldquoDF 编辑器” 搜索结果第一页中的应用更安全和可靠。在那里，你很可能看到带有隐藏的限制和关税的专有应用，缺乏关于数据保护政策和托管的足够信息。你可以有更好的。

这里有五个应用，可以安装在你的 Linux 系统上（和其他系统）或托管在服务器上。每一个都是自由而开源的，具有创建、编辑和注释 PDF 文件的所有必要功能。

LibreOffice

使用 LibreOffice 套件，你对应用的选择取决于最初的任务。虽然文字处理器 LibreOffice Writer，可以让你创建 PDF 文件，并从 ODF 和其他文本格式导出，但 Draw 更适合于处理现有的 PDF 文件。

Draw 是用来创建和编辑图形文件的，如小册子、杂志和海报。因此，其工具集主要用于视觉对象和布局上。然而，对于 PDF 编辑，当文件具有可编辑属性时，LibreOffice Draw 提供了用于修改和添加 PDF 内容的工具。如果没有的话，你仍然可以在现有的内容层上添加新的文本字段，并对文件进行注释或完成。

Draw 和 Writer 都被捆绑在 LibreOffice 桌面套件中，可在 Linux 系统、macOS 和 Windows 上安装。

ONLYOFFICE Docs

ONLYOFFICE 一直在改进 PDF 的处理，并在 ONLYOFFICE Docs 的 7.1 版本中引入了一个全新的 PDF 和电子书的阅读器。

该文档编辑器允许从头开始创建 PDF 文件，使用 DOCX 作为文件的基础，然后可以转换为 PDF 或 PDF/A。通过内置的表单创建功能，ONLYOFFICE Docs 还可以建立可填充的文档模板，并将其导出…]]></summary>

听起来像一个简单的任务，对吧？但是事情并非看起来那么简单。这里有一些不确定是否会出现，但是可能会涉及的东西。

这篇教程将涵盖使用 apt 或 apt-get 命令来安装一个具体指定的程序的版本的所有的重要的方面。

安装一个具体指定版本的程序需要知道的事

在基于 Ubuntu 和 Debian 发行版中，你需要知道一些关于 APT 和存储库是如何工作的知识。

同一个软件包源没有较旧的版本

Ubuntu 在其存储库中不保留较旧版本的软件包。在特殊的情况下，你可以暂时性地看到多个版本。例如，你运行 APT 更新（但不升级）时，可能会有一个可用的新版本。在 APT 缓存中，你可以看到同一个软件包的两个版本。但是，一旦软件包被升级到了新的版本，较旧版本的软件包将从 APT 缓存 和存储库中移除。

使用多个软件包源来使用不同的版本

为获取同一个的软件包的多个版本，你必须得添加多个软件包源。例如，VLC 是版本 3.x 系列。添加 VLC 每日构建 PPA 将会提供（不稳定的）版本 4.x 系列。

同样，你可以下载不同版本的 DEB 文件，并安装它。

较高版本编号的版本通常有优先权

如果你有来自多个软件包源的相同名称的软件，默认情况下，Ubuntu 将安装可用的最高版本编号的版本。

在前面的示例中，如果我安装…]]></summary>

施珊珊像 （章静绘）
美国加州大学圣地亚哥分校历史系教授施珊珊（Sarah Schneewind），曾任美国明史学会会长，是明代政治史、思想史研究领域卓有成就的学者。她的著作《小天命：生祠与明代政治》中文版最近出版，在书中，她将生祠置于明代的政治和信仰之间进行研究，通过大量碑刻记录、地方方志和文人文集，考察了生祠制度，阐发了对明代政治与思想体系的思考。她在接受《上海书评》采访时指出：历史研究者必须审视自己的精英主义偏见，扩充研究视野，认识到中国“小农”并不是政治上的白痴。学者必须认识到这样一种可能性，即明清时期的普通民众有自己的政治观点，并可以为了自己的利益采取有组织的、甚至是制度化的政治行动。

施珊珊：在回答这个问题时，我想往前追溯得更远一些。长久以来，西方学术界一直津津乐道于这样的观点，即白人更加重视个体与自由。而生活在东方——通常指中国——的人们，一直为传统所束缚，处于无限皇权的统治之下。即便在中国内部，虽然相当一部分人坚持为人民的权利而奋斗，但一些学者和政治家还是认为，中国人民尚未做好接受民主的准备，因为“几千年来”（一个惯常使用的短语，但其涵义并不精确），他们都愚昧无知，臣服于专制的帝王。一些中国精英作家认为，经历过这样历史的人们至今都并不适合理解与运用政治权利，尤其是那些“愚昧落后”的小农。由于这些基于历史的观点被用来反对发展人民自我决定的权利，我想知道那些关于历史的说法，历史的“事实”是否真的如此简单。但是，正如历史学家谢和耐（Jacques Gernet）所指出的：“我们所…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[GitHub Copilot 来了，它能帮助程序员，为他们提供人工智能的编码建议，不过，它是否会让事情变得更糟呢？




在 2021 年，我曾花了好几个小时来翻阅 GitHub Copilot 文档，试图弄清楚如何能够加入它的技术预览计划。还好，这一切都得到了回报，我成功加入了预览计划。

而现在，它终于可供所有人使用啦！

如果你还不知道的话，GitHub Copilot 是一个 AI 助手，可帮助你更快、更高效地编写代码。

我能想到的最类似的东西，就是你手机上的（输入法的）自动完成功能。不过，与自动完成功能不同，GitHub Copilot 编写代码，就相当于是在完成整段的句子。

Copilot 现已可供大众使用

正如我在前面提到的，Copilot 已经处于技术预览阶段将近一年了。这意味着，GitHub 只允许非常有限数量的开发者免费使用它，以换取同意 GitHub 监控他们的使用情况，从而改进程序的最终版本。

看起来 GitHub 终于满意地向公众发布了它。现在，任何拥有 GitHub 帐户的人都应该能够使用它，尽管需要付出一定的代价（我很快就会在下面提到）。

公告 中提到：


直到不久前，人工智能都没有能够帮助改进代码，开发软件的过程几乎完全是手动的。现在，这种情况正在改变。今天，我很高兴地宣布，我们正在向所有个人开发者提供 GitHub Copilot。你的 AI 配对程序员来啦。

—— Thomas Dohmke，GitHub CEO


Copilot 作为免费的编辑器扩展，已经帮助数百万开发者加快了他们的编程速度。然而，它确实是有代价的，无论是直接的还是间接的。

GitHub Copilot 定价

与几乎所有令人兴奋的新技术一样，Copilot 对某些人来说可能过于昂贵。它将花费你 10 美元/月或 100 美元/年。

如果你是开源项目维护者或经过验证的学生，那么你可以免费使用它。

GitHub Copilot 不道德吗？

围绕 GitHub Copilot 产品的争议巨大且令人担忧。从技术上讲，这个人工智能是使用大家托管在 GitHub 上的代码来进行训练的。

因此，基本上，GitHub 是通过使用你的代码来提供一个新产品（如果你愿意的话，还可以加点料）。而且，关于 Copilot，可别忘了，自由软件基金会（FSF）也 建议 不要在 GitHub 上托管代码。

我们知道，企业总是喜欢利用事物，但有些人认为这应该不会直接损害托管在 GitHub 上的项目/代码。

但是，是这样吗？

简而言之，在 Copilot 发布后，许多开发者都分享说，他们发现 GitHub Copilot 生成了受版权保护的代码：


我试了下 GitHub Copilot，这是一项付费服务​​，来看看它是否会使用带有限制性许可证的存储库的代码。我检查了它，看看它是否有我在之前雇主那里编写的代码，该代码有一个许可证，只允许其用于免费游戏，并且需要附加许可证。是的，它确实有。




当然，如果我们查看 GitHub Copilot 的常见问题解答（FAQ），其中提到：


GitHub 不拥有 GitHub Copilot 生成的建议。您在 GitHub Copilot 的帮助下编写的代码属于您自己，由您自己负责。


所以说，你为一项服务付了费，最终却为你的项目增加了不便和更多的工作？

在我看来，就简化开发者的任务而言，这听起来一点儿也不令人兴奋。

你对此有什么想法？请在下面的评论区中分享一下吧！

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[GeckoLinux 创建者推出了一个基于 Debian 的新 Linux 发行版，专注于简单性和可用性。




GeckoLinux 改进了的 openSUSE 体验，它的创建者一直保持匿名。

我不会评论这是好事还是坏事，但现在，开发者又带着另一个基于 Debian 的类似项目回来了。

SpiralLinux，这是一个基于 Debian 的发行版，旨在使 Debian 适合最终用户使用。

SpiralLinux：基于 Debian 构建的发行版



毫不奇怪，大多数用户友好的 Linux 发行版都将 Debian 作为其原始基础。Ubuntu 就是在此基础上进行了大量改进，从而提供了良好的桌面体验，即使对于没有 Linux 经验的用户也是如此。

那么，这个发行版有什么不同呢？

嗯，它的创建者说，这个项目旨在帮助你获得 Debian 的所有核心优势，而无需定制很多东西。

如果你想在桌面上使用 Debian，SpiralLinux 是一种接近原版的体验。你还可以根据需要升级到最新的稳定 Debian 版本（或不稳定/测试版），而不会丢失方便易用的自定义设置。

换句话说，SpiralLinux 使 Debian 适合桌面使用，而最终用户只需付出最小的努力。

为了实现这一点，SpiralLinux 使用了 Debian 官方软件包存储库，并提供了现场安装方式，让你能够定制自己的 Debian 系统。

此外，SpiralLinux 还具有以下功能：


开箱即用的 VirtualBox 支持

预装了专有的媒体编解码器和非自由软件包存储库

预装了专有固件

打印机支持

通过 GUI（软件中心）支持 Flatpak

默认启用 zRAM 交换

多种桌面环境（Cinnamon、XFCE、Gnome、Plasma、MATE、Budgie、LXQt）


Debian 始终坚持使用开源和自由软件包，最终用户必须自己搞定编解码器、驱动程序和其他软件包，才能使许多功能正常工作，获得令他们满意的桌面体验。

而 SpiralLinux 似乎可以作为 Debian 的一个有用的替代品，就像 GeckoLinux 之于 openSUSE 一样。

下载 SpiralLinux

如果你一直想尝试 Debian，但又不想在初始配置上费尽心思，你可以尝试 SpiralLinux。

你可以前往其托管在 GitHub 上的官网以了解更多信息，链接如下：

I just wanted to show the progress on my little (maybe useless) side project called tone[1] to get some qualified feedback.
tone is a cross plattform command line audio tagger deployed as a single static binary without dependencies, so a wget should be enough to install on any platform (seems not to work on M1 Macs atm... if someone can help here I would really appreciate it).
  Features:
  - Supports most common formats (mp3, m4a, flac, ape, etc.)
  - Most common AND custom metadata fields
  - Chapter support
  - Embeddable pictures
  - Hackable (write your own taggers with scripting language)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[中国“网红”卢克在非洲国家马拉维诱骗当地儿童，用中文喊出种族歧视口号，并拍成影片在网络贩售。上周，BBC《非洲之眼》（Africa Eye）节目的报道曝光了他的种种剥削行径后，卢克遭马拉维警方通缉，并在邻国赞比亚东部城市奇帕塔被捕。
　　根据BBC的节目画面显示，一群非洲男童围绕在镜头前，在不明白中文字句意思的情况下，异口同声念出“我是黑鬼、智商低”等充满种族歧视的句子。当地孩童称卢克为“叔叔”，他每天会给孩子们0.5美元，要求他们在镜头前面表演，录制祝贺或自嘲影片，影片在中国社交平台出售，最高售价可达70美元。事件曝光之后惊动了当地政府。马拉维当局对卢克发布通缉。6月20日，马拉维移民部门发言人朱鲁向法新社证实，卢克在邻国赞比亚东部城市奇帕塔被捕。
　　我觉得，卢克是教育和政治的牺牲品。
　　卢克本身的文化水平不高，长期受到洗脑教育，对于种族主义和爱国主义没有正确的认识和区别，我相信卢克本身并不是故意想搞种族主义，只是国内长期的教育缺乏，让他没有认识到种族主义是错误的，微信公众上各种大国自信的宣传，让他自然而然产生了“种族自信”这种观念，在拍摄视频的时候，没有意识到某些话题是不能碰的，从而在错误的道路上渐行渐远。至于剥削儿童，我估计卢克干的这行本身就比较内卷，是个体力活，赚不了什么大钱，他自称的收入估计有不少吹嘘的成分。
　　卢克宣扬种族主义的错误观念当然受到了惩罚，他自己也被BBC的节目曝光后，迅速被警方逮捕，并面临法律的审判。
　　而官方也迅速和他切割，中国驻马拉维大使馆上周发表声明，谴责了卢克的行为，称“中国政府对种族主义是零容忍的”，并表示， “大使馆将与马拉维密切合作，并确保这一不幸的案件得到适当的处理”。
　　对于卢克来说，他就是一个牺牲品，应该受到法律的惩罚，但我觉得，那些引导他走上这条错误道路的人，也应该受到法律和道德的惩罚。
　　对于那些身在海外的自媒体人来说，可以合法地利用地域和文化差异，在异国他乡大显身手，但一定要记住，遵守当地的法律法规和道德规范，如果这些法律法规和道德规范与国内的法规和道德相冲突，以当地的法律和道德为准。]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[火星快车号上 Windows 98 时期的软件得到了更新

欧洲航天局于 2003 年发射的火星快车号已经运行了近 20 年，火星快车号包括两个部份：火星快车号卫星与小猎犬 2 号登陆器，不过小猎犬 2 号后来失去联系。卫星上的火星地下和电离层探测高级雷达（MARSIS）是 2018 年在火星上发现巨大的地下液态水层的关键，该软件使用的是基于 Windows 98 的开发环境。欧洲航天局正在升级该软件，新的软件将使 MARSIS 开启的时间延长五倍，并在每次通过时探索更大的区域。这就像是“发射近 20 年后，火星快车号上有了一个全新的仪器一样。”


消息来源：The Verge



老王点评：看来 Windows 98 一直运行的也挺好。那么，微软为啥让大家一直升级呢？




ARM 最初的操作系统 35 年后仍在更新

1987 年 6 月，Acron 推出了起价 800 英镑的 Archimedes A305 / A310 计算机。在那个年代，其产品性能设计相当先进，且提供了当时名为 Arthur 的新操作系统。两年后，它被更名为 RISC OS。如今，RISC OS 的一个分支，仍然支持 Acron 时代独特的 26 位模式，当然，目前只能运行在模拟器中。另一个分支是为 32 位的 ARM 芯片设计的，并于 2018 年开源。如今，它还在继续维护更新，近日发布了一个源自 OpenBSD 的新 TCP/IP 栈，带来了对 IPv6 的支持。但它目前还不支持 Wi-Fi，以及不支持多核处理器技术 SMP。


消息来源：The Register



老王点评：这么古老的操作系统，是操作系统发展历史上一块块纪念碑，更多只是回味。




“首个桌面操作系统根社区” openKylin 发布

昨日，麒麟软件联合普华、中科方德、麒麟信安、中兴新支点、先进操作系统创新中心等发起了中国“首个桌面操作系统根社区” openKylin 社区。所谓根社区，是指基于 Linux 内核和其他开源组件而构建，不依赖上游发行版的社区。在视频发布会上，邀请了若干院士发表了致辞，并呼吁更多的行业伙伴加入，携手打造“产业主导、平台自主、技术先进、生态丰富”的桌面操作系统根社区。

老王点评：看来国产根社区的春天到了，这又是一家。似乎“根社区”这个说法是从开放原子开源基金会开始出现的？]]></summary>

如今，人们有更多喜欢 Linux 的理由。在这个系列里，我将分享 21 个使用 Linux 的理由。今天，我将从游戏开始。

我过去认为“游戏玩家”是一种非常特殊的生物，要由科学家们在数年的研究和测试之后严谨地认定才行。我从来没有把自己归类为游戏玩家，因为我所玩过的游戏要么是桌面游戏（棋盘类游戏和纸笔角色扮演游戏），要么是 NetHack、俄罗斯方块。现在，在移动设备、游戏机、电脑和电视机上都有游戏，我觉得现在的承认有各种形式的游戏玩家们了。如果你想自称为游戏玩家，你就可以是，不需任何资格认定。你不用必须在心里熟记那些“上上下下左右左右BA”的科乐美秘籍（你甚至可以不知道这是什么）；你也不用必须买过和玩过 3A 级游戏。如果你时不时地玩游戏，你就完全可以自称为玩家。如果你想成为一名玩家，那么现在使用 Linux 正当其时。

欢迎来到游戏世界

剥除光鲜的广告，在其下面，你肯定会发现一个欣欣向荣的游戏世界。在人们相信不是电子表格也不是练习打字一类的软件能挣钱以前，新兴的游戏市场已经开始发展起来了。独立游戏indie game已经在流行文化上以各种方式打上了自己的烙印（或许你不相信，《我的世界》尽管不是开源的，但一开始就是一款独立游戏），这也证实了，在玩家眼里，可玩性高于产品价值。

独立开发者和开源开发者之间有很多交集。没有什么比带着你的 Linux 笔记本电脑，浏览 itch.io 或你的发行版的软件库，寻找鲜为人知但珍贵的开源游戏宝藏更有意义了。

有各种各样的开源游戏，包括大量的第一视角射击游戏、Nodulus 之类的益智游戏、运输大亨之类的策略经营游戏、Jethook 之类的竞速游戏、Sauerbraten 之类的竞速逃生游戏，以及很多未提到的（多亏了像 O…]]></summary>

《民族的神话：欧洲的中世纪起源》，[美]帕特里克·格里著，广西师范大学出版社｜新民说2022年2月出版，吕昭、杨光译，262页，64.00元
一

现代史学诞生于十九世纪的德国，它作为欧洲民族主义的工具被构想和发明出来，之后在民族史学中获得巨大成功。然而，在获得成功的同时，它散发的民族主义毒气却从学界和政界蔓延开来，最终渗透进大众的意识。祛除这种意识成为令当下历史学家望而却步的难题，从这个意义上来看，《民族的神话》这本书可以被视为历史学家帕特里克·格里（Patrick J. Geary）自觉的努力，作为中世纪早期史的历史学家，他似乎在专业上更有义务去面对这个难题。

这当然与罗马帝国晚期和西欧中世纪早期的社会和历史格局休戚相关。按照“野蛮人入侵”（the Barbarian Invasions）的古老叙事，晚期罗马帝国这本身算不上铜墙铁壁的政治统一体被北方的日耳曼人穿凿而过，分裂成大小不一的政治体，或者说野蛮人的王国。这种叙事并非是现代的，它源于公元八世纪，比如写作《伦巴底人史》（Historia Langobardorum）的伦巴底历史学家保罗执事（Paulus Diaconus）就这样认为。另一份更明确的证据是一位匿名作家写作的圣徒传《国王圣西吉斯蒙的痛苦》（Passio sancti Sigismundi regis），这份文献认为，在提比略皇帝时期，就有人从斯堪的纳维亚半岛迁徙到莱茵河沿岸。而到了瓦伦提比安皇帝时期，这些人的后代以野蛮的方式入侵了臣服于帝国的人民和土地。这种“野蛮人入侵”的叙事一直持续到现代，意大利历史学家莫米利亚诺（Arnaldo Momigliano）便认为罗马的衰亡是因为被征服，日耳曼民族因军事上更强的战力占领了帝国西部。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[2022 年 6 月 16 日，微软更新了其应用商店的策略。其中一项禁止了发布者对开源或免费的软件收取费用，另一项则针对的是商店使用的不合理高价。如果你在过去几年中访问过微软应用商店，你可能已经注意到，它正在成为越来越多的开源和免费产品的所在地。如果原始开发者将应用程序和游戏上传到商店，这将是有益的，但情况并非如此，因为它们是由第三方上传的。

更糟糕的是，其中许多程序仅作为付费应用提供，而不是免费下载。换句话说，微软的客户必须付费才能购买应用商店的版本，而它们在其他地方是免费的！在应用商店中，免费版和付费版有时并存。为免费应用付费已经够糟糕的了，但这并不是用户在购买时可能遇到的唯一问题。更新也可能是一个问题，因为山寨应用可能不会像源头应用程序那样频繁或快速地更新。

在更新的微软商店政策中，微软在 10.8.7 节下指出：


在您决定产品或应用内购买的定价时，您的数字产品或服务的所有定价（包括销售或折扣）必须：

遵守所有适用的法律、法规和监管要求，包括联邦贸易委员会的《反欺骗性定价指南》。您不得试图从开源软件或其他可免费获得的软件中获利，您的产品也不应提供一个（与它提供的特性和功能相比）过高的不合理定价。


这个新策略在更新部分中得到了确认。如果开源和免费产品普遍免费提供，则它们不得在微软应用商店上出售，发布者也不得对其产品收取不合理的高价。开源和免费应用的开发者可以在微软应用商店上为其产品收费。例如，Paint.net 的开发者就是这样做的。如果微软强制执行这些策略，许多应用将从应用商店中删除。以前，开发者可以向微软报告应用程序，但在新策略下，微软可以直接控制应用的列出和提交。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi,
 I am new to Linux (I installed Arch btw /s).
 I was wondering if you know any packages for displaying data visualizations on Linux Desktop where visualization layer is overlaid on top of wallpaper or displayed instead of wallpaper.
 Some kind of intermediary layer that I could use to create sets of custom visualizations of graphs, charts, raw data, etc. that I would pull from public APIs or data scrape. These visualizations would be generated on desktop and they would be interactive: graphs/charts/tables would be able to able to update in real time based on incoming data.
 ​
 Since python has tons of data visualization libraries (and easy API support), maybe there is an efficient way to turn desktop/wallpaper into a sort of a Jupyter Notebook output without too much of a performance hit?
 Is there a framework or package that streamlines this use case?
 It would be nice for creating real-time C&C setups on desktop. Sort of turning desktop/wallpaper into a flexible custom Bloomberg terminal, but not just for finance data -- anything, whatever I would code the logic for (e.g., in Python).
 As a bonus, it would be nice if the renders of the visualizations could be highly customizable (like, for example, generating a graph and being able to set its own and its background transparency, color of the whole thing, positioning, etc.)
 KDE Plasma would be my primary platform of interest, but if something like that exist for a different DE or WM, I am all ears.
 ​
 Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Manjaro Linux 21.3.0 发行包包含一些最新和最强大的更新，包括改进的安装程序。




Manjaro Linux 是一个滚动发布的发行版。因此，从技术上讲，如果你定期更新系统的话，你一直都会使用最新版本。

升级到 Manjaro 21.3.0 应该没什么大不了的，考虑到我已经在正式发布前几天就已经在稳定运行它了，毫无问题。

另外，你可能想阅读一下我 从 Ubuntu 切换到 Manjaro 的初步体验（如果你对于升级仍然犹豫不决的话）。

那么，Manjaro 21.3.0 带来了什么更新呢？

Manjaro 21.3.0 更新内容



桌面环境升级到了最新的稳定版本，而内核版本仍然是 Linux 内核 5.15 LTS。

此外，这个版本还包括最终的 Clamares v3.2 版本。让我们来看看它有哪些变化吧。

Calamares v3.2.59

Calamares v3.2.59 安装程序是 3.2 系列的最终版本，它有许多有意义的改进。这次，分区模块包含了对 LUKS 分区的支持和更多改进，以避免那些可能会弄乱 Manjaro 安装的设置。

Calamares 3.2 的所有未来版本都将仅是错误修复。

GNOME 42 + Libadwaita

最初的版本包含了 GNOME 42，而最新的版本包含了 GNOME 42.2（附带最新的更新）。

总体而言，你将获得 GNOME 42 引入的所有优点，包括系统范围的深色模式、基于 GTK 4 的 GNOME 应用的现代用户界面、升级的应用程序以及其他一些重大变化。



KDE Plasma 5.24

不幸的是，考虑到它差不多是在同一周发布的，因此该版本无法包含 KDE Plasma 5.25。

KDE Plasma 5.24 是一个不错的升级，具有更新的主题和概览效果。

XFCE 4.16

在 Xfce 4.16 中，窗口管理器得到了许多更新和改进，以支持小数倍数的缩放和更多功能。

下载 Manjaro 21.3.0

到目前为止，我在 Manjaro 21.3.0 GNOME 版本中没有遇到任何问题。一切看起来都不错，升级也很顺利。

但是，如果你不想重新安装或丢失重要文件，则应始终进行备份。

你可以从 Manjaro 的下载页面 下载最新版本。你也应该可以通过 pamac 包管理器获得更新。

无论哪种情况，你都可以在终端中输入以下命令进行升级：

sudo pacmane -Syu

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm running Wayland and Gnome 42, and recently installed Flameshot (a screenshot tool). The good news is that Flameshot 12 has Wayland support! It's actually quite good. The bad news is that the workflow is as follows:
  
Press your screenshot shortcut key or combo
 Address pop-up dialog asking for permission (xdg-desktop-portal)
 Select screenshot area, and add annotations (flameshot)
 Save / copy to clipboard
  
Many people find this to be too many steps. In addition, the native gnome/wayland screenshot tool white-lists itself, so that step 2 is not necessary (good workflow!)
 According to the Flameshot developers, they have no control over step 2, as this is implemented as a security feature of Wayland / xdg-desktop-portal.
 I agree this is a good general direction for the desktop; however, the current implementation does not have a "remember this setting" option, and therefore becomes annoying very quickly.
 Discussion at xdg-desktop-portal shows that there is interest in developing a "remember this setting" kind of feature, but they do not currently have bandwidth:
 https://github.com/flatpak/xdg-desktop-portal/issues/649
 Would anyone be able to step up to "close the gap" for all screenshot tools on Wayland? (Flameshot, ksnip, etc.)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[在中国，几乎每一个接触过 Linux 的人都听说过深度操作系统（即 Deepin OS），甚至不少人还使用过它，并一直在使用它。因此，当深度华丽转身为统信，并打出了一系列让人目不暇接的组合拳时：推出 UOS、加入了欧拉生态，同华为等欧拉伙伴们一同打造了欧拉根社区等等，让关注深度、关注国产操作系统和信创的人们开始探究这一切背后的动因，以及接下来的发展。

作为多年来一直关注开源技术发展的开源人，我约了统信的任紫东先生聊了聊，希望将从深度到统信，再到加入欧拉生态的背后的脉络展示给大家。



从桌面到服务器，从深度到统信

作为最著名的国产 Linux 操作系统之一，深度操作系统（Deepin OS）在国内外拥有一大批忠实的用户和支持者，其代表性桌面环境深度桌面（DDE）也被移植到多个 Linux 发行版之上。可能是由于深度操作系统太过成功，以至于在很多人印象中，深度只是一家桌面 Linux 操作系统供应商。

在 2019 年，统信成立并推出了 UOS，开始将目光转向了服务器、云计算等领域。无独有偶的是，同样的趋势我们也能在 Ubuntu 背后的发行商 Canonical 上、以及其它的 Linux 发行版厂商上发现。这让我们开始产生一个问题，是桌面操作系统不再重要，已经不能代表现代企业计算的主要需求了吗？

对于这个问题，任紫东的看法是，“桌面和服务器端一样重要”。一方面，虽然深度操作系统在国产 Linux 桌面操作系统中占据了较大份额，但整个 Linux 桌面只占有了近 5% 的国内桌面市场份额，可以说还有很大的发展空间。另外一方面，在 Linux 用户群体方面，往往其桌面环境和服务器环境都采用了 Linux，这种环境的协调一致，有利于他们的工作，比如开发、运维、测试等等。这也是为什么微软要在 Windows 中加入 WSL 来弥合开发人群的日用和目标操作系统…]]></summary>

微软已经正式宣布，WSL 2 发行版现在支持 Windows Server 2022 了。这对有特殊用例的开发者来说确实是好事，因为他们需要在 Windows Server 2022 上启动 Linux 时，不再需要全功能的 Hyper-V 会话。WSL2 更加轻量级。之前微软的人曾说，虽然这项技术对桌面用户来说很方便，但把它放在服务器上可能意味着，它被用来做一些它不打算做的事情。另外，微软没有将 WSL2 移植回 Windows Server 2019 的计划。

老王点评：微软又张开了吞下 Linux 的大口，不但是“面向开发者”，这回是面向运维人员了吧。




美参议员将加密货币监管法案草案发布到 GitHub 上

本周三，美国参议员 Cynthia Lummis 对即将到来的加密货币监管法案采取了令人惊讶的新措施：将其托管在 GitHub 上，请大家对起草的法案框架贡献评论。GitHub 用户们已经对法案提出了几十个评论和拉取请求，其中一些提出了对法案有意义的补充。比如“通过对采矿征税来增加工作量证明加密货币的价值”。另一个评论提出了对稳定币算法支持的担忧。


消息来源：GitHub



老王点评：这才像是征求意见，以“开源”的方式，透明的推动进步。




首个全链路国产操作系统 OpenCloudOS 发布

据其官方公众号消息，OpenCloudOS 正式发布了“首个源社区（L1）项目及首个全量软件包（L3）版本”，并披露了技术研发路线图。OpenCloudOS 是去年 12 月由腾讯牵头成立的开源操作系统社区，其成员包括北京红旗、飞腾、浪潮、龙芯中科、兆芯等几十家操作系统生态厂商及用户。OpenCloudOS 在宣传中说它是“我国首个具备全链路国产化能力的服务器操作系统”，并提出了 L1 源社区、L2 商业版、L3 社区稳定版和 L4 衍生发行版的层级划分。OpenCloudOS 称其“社区及衍生版已经装机逾千万”。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[许多大型代码库中都有 Lisp 代码的身影，因此，熟悉一下这门语言是一个明智之举。




早在 1958 年，Lisp 就被发明出来了，它是世界上第二古老的计算机编程语言（LCTT 译注：最古老的编程语言是 Fortran，诞生于 1957 年）。它有许多现代的衍生品，包括 Common Lisp、Emacs Lisp（Elisp）、Clojure、Racket、Scheme、Fennel 和 GNU Guile 等。

那些喜欢思考编程语言的设计的人，往往都喜欢 Lisp，因为它的语法和数据有着相同的结构：Lisp 代码实际上是一个列表的列表a list of lists，它的名字其实是 “列表处理LISt Processing” 的简写。而那些喜欢思考编程语言的美学的人，往往都讨厌 Lisp，因为它经常使用括号来定义范围；事实上，编程界也有一个广为流传的笑话：Lisp 代表的其实是 “大量烦人的多余括号”Lots of Irritating Superfluous Parentheses。

不管你是喜欢还是讨厌 Lisp 的设计哲学，你都不得不承认，它都是一门有趣的语言，过去如此，现在亦然（这得归功于现代方言 Clojure 和 Guile）。你可能会惊讶于在任何特定行业的大代码库中潜伏着多少 Lisp 代码，因此，现在开始学习 Lisp，至少熟悉一下它，不失为一个好主意。

安装 Lisp

Lisp 有很多不同的实现。比较流行的开源版本有 SBCL、GNU Lisp 和 GNU Common Lisp（GCL）。你可以使用发行版的包管理器安装它们中的任意一个，在本文中，我是用的是 clisp（LCTT 译注：也就是 GNU Lisp，一种 ANSI Common Lisp 的实现）。

以下是在不同的 Linux 发行版中安装 clisp 的步骤…]]></summary>

 来源：澎湃新闻
                
在回顾早年童话创作的艰辛历程时，安徒生坦言有不少作品均改编自本国或外来的民间传说，“其余真是出于我自己的创作的，只有《小伊达的花》《拇指丽娜》和《小女人鱼》，所以这三篇应当算是我起头的三篇创作的童话。最后一篇颇引起了大家的注意，我也就因为得到了这篇的成功，立意以后还要自己创作”（张友松译《安徒生童话的来源和系统——他自己的记载》，载1925年《小说月报》第十六卷第九号），足见这篇《小女人鱼》——也就是后来习称的《海的女儿》——在其文学生涯中的重要地位和深远影响。钩稽考较这篇童话自近代以来的汉译历程和早期各种译本的异同得失，以及由此衍生的各类创作和引发的褒贬评议，也有不少耐人寻味的遗闻轶事可供覆按。

一、从“重述”“改编”到“直译”

时任商务印书馆编译所高级编辑的孙毓修从1909年起主持编纂《童话》丛书，率先将这篇童话译成汉语，并改易其篇名为《海公主》（《童话》第一集第五十六编，商务印书馆，1917年）。在全篇临近结束时，他只含糊其辞地交代道，“这段故事，在下是从外国书上翻译下来的，到底有这起事没有这起事，在下也不能说定”，并没有具体说明所依据的底本。稍事比勘后不难发现，其主要人物和基本情节都源自安徒生童话，在铺陈敷演时则有许多加油添醋的增饰。全书甫一开卷便竭力夸耀人类生活的繁华闲适，提到“清风明月，不用钱买”，就把李白《襄阳歌》中名句的“清风明月不用一钱买”檃栝在内。随后描摹海王耗费多年心血营建王宫，“千门万户，杰阁重楼，不输秦始皇阿房宫的广大，汉高祖未央宫的坚固。他的材料，尽是海中所有的珊瑚明珠，宝气涵波，精光夺目。世界上的王宫，不过些砖泥木石罢了，此又秦皇汉武，所及不来的”，则将阿房、未央这些耳熟能详的古代宫殿拈来作比，以彰显海底生活的奢华富贵。诸如此类，不一而足，使原本异域色彩浓郁的童话，…]]></summary>

 I'd like to contribute back in the form of QA or Edge testing of latest P/E Core upgrades when they are patching for testing (hopefully it can be applied to Debian, as that's what I'd run).

Ultimately, I'm hoping the new Intel scheduler(s) will be highly configurable. Like, letting me force all procs to E cores on battery, force certain binaries to always run on E cores, and things like launching an app with ENV vars to designate which core I want it to run on.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[使用深圳电信的宽带拨号上网的时候，如果不手动设置DNS，拨号后会使用系统默认设置的DNS：深圳电信的DNS，这个DNS存在很多问题，建议电信用户使用更为专业有效的国内公共DNS，例如阿里DNS、腾讯DNS等。
　　最近我上网的时候，发现不少经常访问的网页会出现问题，例如图片无法显示、Javascript无法运行等等错误，经过大量排查，才发现问题的根源是，我使用了不可靠的DNS：深圳电信的DNS（IP地址202.96.134.133）。
　　具体情况是这样的，我在使用谷歌翻译进行中英文翻译的时候，发现该网站的部分图片无法显示，按F12打开谷歌浏览器控制台，发现是 fonts.gstatic.com域名下的资源无法访问。此外，我访问其他网站发现Javascript无法运行，按F12打开谷歌浏览器控制台，发现jQuery所在的域名cdnjs.cloudflare.com无法访问。
　　我ping了一下这两个域名，发现IP地址都不对，都被修改为127.0.0.1，为了确认是不是DNS的问题，我使用nslookup命令进行验证。
　　nslookup命令用于查询DNS的记录，查看域名解析是否正常，在网络故障的时候用来诊断网络问题。命令格式为：nslookup domain [dns-server]
　　我输入如下命令
　　nslookup fonts.gstatic.com 202.96.134.133
　　nslookup cdnjs.cloudflare.com 202.96.134.133

　　系统返回的IP地址为::1和127.0.0.1，::1是IPv6地址，相当于IPV4的127.0.0.1。
　　做为对比，我使用常用的国内公共DNS，如阿里DNS、腾讯DNS、百度DNS、114DNS等进行验证，全部都可以返回正确的IP地址，如下图所示。

　　因此我得出结论，深圳电信在胡搞。
　　我这里只发现了两个正规网站的域名解析被非法篡改，我相信实际被非法篡改的域名数量应该非常多，鉴于深圳电信的DNS如此不专业不可靠，建议深圳地区的电信用户上网的时候，手动将DNS设置为更专业更可靠的其他国内公共DNS，例如阿里、腾讯等DNS，不要再使用深圳电信的DNS，以免给自己上网带来大量不必要的问题。]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[极客们好，将 Ubuntu 22.04（Jammy Jellyfish）启动到救援Rescue和紧急Emergency模式可以重置忘记的用户密码、修复文件系统错误，以及在启动过程中禁用或启用 systemd 服务。

在这篇文章中，我们将学习如何启动 Ubuntu 22.04 LTS 系统进入救援和应急模式。救援模式类似于单用户模式，所有的故障排除步骤都在这里进行。救援模式加载最小的环境并挂载根文件系统。

而在紧急模式下，我们得到的是单用户 Shell，而不启动任何系统服务。因此，当我们无法启动系统进入救援模式时，就需要紧急模式。

启动 Ubuntu 22.04 进入救援或单用户模式

前往你想启动到救援或单用户模式的目标系统。在启动时按下 SHIFT + ESC 键，进入 GRUB 引导加载器页面。



选择第一个选项 “Ubuntu”，并按 e 键进入编辑模式。

在以 linux 开头的一行末尾，删除字符串 $vt_handoff 并添加字符串 systemd.unit=rescue.target。



做完修改后，按 Ctrl + X 或 F10 在救援模式下启动。



进入救援模式后，运行所有的故障排除命令，并运行 systemctl reboot 命令来重启系统。

另一种启动系统进入救援模式的方法

重新启动系统并按下 ESC + Shift 键，进入 GRUB 启动界面。

选择第二个选项 “Ubuntu 高级选项Advanced Options for Ubuntu”->选择“恢复模式recovery mode”选项并点击回车->选择 root（进入 root shell 提示符）root (Drop to root shell prompt)。

下面是一个例子：



当你有了 root Shell，运行命令来恢复和修复系统问题，最后使用 systemctl reboot 来重启系统。

引导 Ubuntu 22.04 进入紧急模式

要启动系统进入紧急模式，首先进入 GRUB 页面。



选择第一个选项 “Ubuntu” 并按 e 键进行编辑。寻找以 linux 开头的一行，移到该行的末尾，删除字符串 $vt_handoff 并添加字符串 systemd.unit=emergency.target。



按 Ctrl + X 或 F10 将系统启动到紧急模式。



同样，在紧急模式下，你可以在这个模式下执行所有的故障排除，完成后，就用 systemctl reboot 命令重启系统。

这篇文章的内容就这些。文章内容丰富，不要犹豫，请在你的技术朋友中分享它。请在下面的评论区发表你的疑问和反馈。

        <id>https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=31855732</id>
        <link href="https://www.nerdcrawler.com/"/>
        <updated>2022-06-23T22:10:24.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've been a fan of comics since I watched the X-Men Animated Series in the 90s, and I fell in love with collecting original comic art when I got my first Jim Lee sketch in high school.
But, after missing out on some original comic art pieces because I didn't know when they were added for sale on websites, I decided to take it upon myself to make an app that monitors original comic art sites and emails/texts you when new art drops.
It's called Nerd Crawler and I'm building it myself so there might be some bugs but I'm hoping it helps comic art collectors. It works with over 40 original comic art websites like Albert Moy (Jim Lee's art dealer), Cadence Comic Art, Artcoholics, a bunch of Big Cartel sites like Jim Cheung / Jason Fabok / Dustin Nguyen, Greg Capullo Art, Skottie Young, and more.
It's free to try @ https://www.nerdcrawler.com/, and you can upgrade to a paid plan if you want text messages alerts or want to check sites every 10 minutes or 1 minute.
From a technical standpoint, my tech stack is:
- Ruby on Rails
- Hosted on Heroku
- Emails sent by Mailgun
- Texts sent by Twilio
- Images hosted on Cloudinary
- Credit card charging handled by Stripe and the new, low-code Stripe Checkout
The minimum viable product was built in about a week with minor bug fixes and new features added weekly.
If you have any feedback, have art sites you wanted added, or questions, let me know!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Drew DeVault takes
issue with GitHub's "Copilot" offering and the licensing issues that it raises:


	GitHub’s Copilot is trained on software governed by these terms,
	and it fails to uphold them, and enables customers to accidentally
	fail to uphold these terms themselves. Some argue about the risks
	of a “copyleft surprise”, wherein someone incorporates a GPL
	licensed work into their product and is surprised to find that they
	are obligated to release their product under the terms of the GPL
	as well. Copilot institutionalizes this risk and any user who
	wishes to use it to develop non-free software would be well-advised
	not to do so, else they may find themselves legally liable to
	uphold these terms, perhaps ultimately being required to release
	their works under the terms of a license which is undesirable for
	their goals.


Chances are that many people will disagree with DeVault's reasoning, but
this is an issue that merits some discussion still.]]></summary>

Most online writing today is produced in a broken way. Writers are commonly told to publish a lot, see how readers respond, and adjust. But most internet readers don’t comment or respond. They just get whatever they can and move on. They bail on an article the minute it fails to hold their attention, and you don’t get a second chance. Thus the most common response to writing online is silence. Silence is a terrible teacher!
What writers need is feedback before they hit publish, so that readers receive the best-expressed version of their ideas.…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[外媒报道中国芯片行业高速发展

数据显示，过去四个季度全世界增长速度最快的 20 家芯片行业公司有 19 家在中国。据中国半导体行业协会的数据，2021 年中国芯片制造商和设计公司的总销售额增长 18%，达到创纪录的逾 1 万亿元人民币。中芯国际和华虹半导体是中国最大的合同芯片制造商，中芯国际最近报告其季度销售额增长 67%，超过 GlobalFoundries 和台积电。视频芯片设计公司上海富瀚微电子的收入平均增长 37%，它计划进入电动汽车和人工智能领域。集成电路软件工具开发商上海概伦电子过去四个季度平均销售额增长了一倍，它声称其软件可用于制造 3 纳米芯片。

老王点评：美国的封锁一时打压了中国企业的增长，但也促进了中国芯片产业的发展。




Rust 有可能在 Linux 5.20 中合并

在 Linux 基金会近日举行的开源峰会上，Linus Torvalds 谈到了 Rust 在 Linux 内核中的可能性，并表示它可能很快就会登陆，甚至可能是在下一个内核周期。目前还没有任何 Rust for Linux 的拉取请求被发送和合并，但很多初始的 Rust 启用代码已经就绪。上个月发布了最新的 Rust for Linux 内核补丁，使更多的功能得以形成，并完成了更多审查。


消息来源：Phoronix



老王点评：说实话，Rust 支持是最值得期待的特性之一了，但是距离 Rust 在内核中普遍使用，可能还有很远。




内核开发者仍然在实验 -O3 级优化

Linux 内核的编译采用 -O2 级的优化，虽然采用更高级别 -O3 编译会得到更高性能的内核，但由于内核的复杂性和非常大的代码库，它很可能在低级别的内核代码中出现错误或不正确的行为。因此采用 -O3 编译的内核并没有得到广泛认可。甚至一些内核开发者不希望看到它成为 Kconfig 选项。但是有一些爱好者对 -O3 优化内核以获得更高的性能感兴趣，或者试图发现 Linux 内核代码和编译器本身的优化出错的错误。最近有开发者发出一组补丁，使之可以在所有架构上使用该优化级别。


消息来源：Phoronix



老王点评：一般来说，上游的 Linux 内核开发者对新的的编译器功能是相当保守的，只是为了提高性能，而这可能意味着微妙的错误/难以检测的问题。但是我觉得作为实验性的功能值得探索。]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[有一大堆文件尺寸巨大的图片占用了太多的磁盘空间？或者你必须将图片上传到有文件大小限制的门户网站？

你可能有很多原因想要压缩图片。有大量的工具可以帮助你，我在这里说的不是命令行的工具。

你可以使用一个成熟的图像编辑器，如 GIMP。你也可以使用像 Squoosh 这样的网络工具，这是谷歌的一个开源项目。它甚至可以让你比较每个压缩级别的文件。

然而，所有这些工具都是针对单个图像工作的。如果你想批量压缩照片怎么办？Curtail 是一个能帮助你的应用。

Curtail: Linux 中用于图像压缩的灵巧工具

使用 Python 和 GTK3 构建的 Curtail 是一个简单的 GUI 应用，使用 OptiPNG、jpegoptim 等开源库来提供图像压缩功能。

它有一个 Flatpak 应用。请确保你的系统已启用 Flatpak 支持。

首先添加 Flathub 仓库：

flatpak remote-add --if-not-exists flathub https://flathub.org/repo/flathub.flatpakrepo


然后使用下面的命令来安装 Curtail：

flatpak install flathub com.github.huluti.Curtail


安装后，在你的 Linux 系统的菜单中寻找它，并从那里启动它。



界面朴素而简单。你可以选择你想要无损压缩还是有损压缩。

有损压缩会有质量差的图像，但尺寸较小。无损压缩会有更好的质量，但尺寸可能不会比原来的小很多。



你可以浏览图片，或者把它们拖到应用中。

是的，你可以用 Curtail 一键压缩多张图片。

事实上，你甚至不需要点击。只要你选择图片或拖放它们，它们就会被压缩，你会看到压缩过程的摘要。



正如你在上面的图片中看到的，我的一张图片的尺寸减少了 35%，另外两张图片的尺寸减少了 3% 和 8%。这是在无损压缩的情况下。

这些图片以 -min 为后缀（默认），保存在与原始图片相同的目录中。

虽然它看起来很简约，但有几个选项可以配置 Curtail。点击菜单，你会看到一些设置选项。



你可以选择是将压缩文件保存为新文件还是替换现有文件。如果你选择新文件（默认行为），你也可以为压缩后的图像提供一个不同的后缀。保留文件属性的选项也在这里。

在下一个选项卡中，你可以配置有损压缩的设置。默认情况下，压缩级别为 90%。



高级选项卡让你可以选择配置 PNG 和 WebP 文件的无损压缩级别。



总结

正如我前面所说，这不是一个突破性的工具。你可以用其他工具如 GIMP 做同样的事情。它只是使图像压缩的任务更简单，特别是对于批量图像压缩。

我很想看到在压缩时有转换图像文件格式的选项，就像我们在 Converseen 等工具中所拥有的那样。

总的来说，对于图像压缩的具体目的来说，这是一个不错的小工具。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[大家好！我又写了一篇关于 我最喜欢的电脑工具 的文章。这一篇讲的是 Docker Compose！

本文主要就是讲一讲我对 Docker Compose 有多么满意啦（不讨论它的缺点）！咳咳，因为它总能够完成它该做的，并且似乎总能有效，更棒的是，它的使用还非常简单。另外，在本文中，我只讨论我是如何用 Docker Compose 来搭建开发环境的，而不涉及它在生产中的使用。

最近，我考虑了很多关于这种个人开发环境的搭建方式，原因是，我现在把所有的计算工作都搬到了一个私有云上，大概 20 美元/月的样子。这样一来，我就不用在工作的时候花时间去思考应该如何管理几千台 AWS 服务器了。

在此之前，我曾花了两天的时间，尝试使用其他的工具来尝试搭建一个开发环境，搭到后面，我实在是心累了。相比起来，Docker Compose 就简单易用多了，我非常满意。于是，我和妹妹分享了我的 docker-compose 使用经历，她略显惊讶：“是吧！你也觉得 Docker Compose 真棒对吧！” 嗯，我觉得我应该写一篇博文把过程记录下来，于是就有了你们看到的这篇文章。

我们的目标是：搭建一个开发环境

目前，我正在编写一个 Ruby on Rails 服务（它是一个计算机“调试”游戏的后端）。在我的生产服务器上，我安装了：


一个 Nginx 服务器

一个 Rails 服务

一个 Go 服务（使用了 gotty 来代理一些 SSH 连接）

一个 Postgres 数据库


在本地搭建 Rails 服务非常简单，用不着容器（我只需要安装 Postgres 和 Ruby 就行了，小菜一碟）。但是，我还想要把匹配 /proxy/* 的请求的发送到 Go 服务，其他所有请求都发送到 Rails 服务，所以需要借助 Nginx。问题来了，在笔记本电脑上安装…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[一名安全专家成功地在谷歌 Nest Hub（第 2 代）上运行了 Ubuntu，嗯，然后呢？




我刚刚看到了一个关于在谷歌 Nest Hub（第 2 代）上运行的 Ubuntu 的消息。

嗯，这实在是让人兴奋！

所以，让我在这里分享更多关于它的信息吧。

破解谷歌 Nest Hub 以安装 Ubuntu

是的，破解使得这成为可能。

网络安全专家 Frédéric Basse 破解了谷歌 Nest Hub（第 2 代）的安全启动，并成功运行 Ubuntu。

当然，谷歌 Nest Hub 并没有正式支持启动一个自定义操作系统。但是，Fred 使用了一个安全漏洞，从而成功运行了 Ubuntu。

虽然这很有趣，但对于始终在线的谷歌智能家居显示器来说，这也是一个严重的安全问题。



正如这位安全专家在 博客文章 中所解释的，他使用了树莓派 Pico 微控制器，利用引导加载程序中的 USB 漏洞，从而破坏了安全启动链。

这位安全专家得出结论：


因此，攻击者可以通过插入恶意 USB 设备并按下两个按钮，从而在早期启动阶段（内核执行之前）执行任意代码。


如果你想进行实验（适合安全研究人员），他还在 GitHub 上提供了相关代码（关于如何利用这个引导加载程序漏洞）。

让 Ubuntu 在 Google Nest 上运行



该漏洞允许攻击者启动未签名的操作系统。但是，在那之前，攻击者必须对为树莓派（64 位 ARM 版）量身定制的预装 Ubuntu 镜像进行一些修改。

这位安全专家还提到了以下内容：


我们构建了一个自定义 U-Boot 引导加载程序，禁用了安全引导，并更改了引导流程以从 USB 闪存驱动器加载环境。我们还为 elaine 构建了一个自定义 Linux 内核，其中包括包括了一些 额外驱动，例如 USB 鼠标 。重新打包了来自 Ubuntu 的初始 ramdisk（initrd），以集成触摸屏所需的固件二进制文件。引导镜像是基于自定义 Linux 内核和修改的 initrd 创建的。


因此，很明显，你不会获得完整的 Ubuntu 体验，但由于该漏洞，我们现在知道，如果你愿意破解 谷歌 Nest 进行测试的话（真心不建议！），Ubuntu 是可以在谷歌 Nest 上作运行的。

智能家居安全担忧 + Linux

网络安全专家指出，该漏洞已在上游（两次）修复。

但是，研究人员也指出，缺乏分配的 CVE 编号可能会导致修复程序无法向下游传播。

毫无疑问，看到有人在不受支持的设备上运行 Linux 真是太棒了。这让我思考，我们是否应该也制造一些 由 Linux 驱动的商业智能家居设备？

或者说，已经有类似的东西了吗？

然而，智能家居设备容易受到简单攻击，也同样令人担忧。

你怎么看？在下面的评论中分享你的想法吧。

《皮》， [意] 库尔齐奥·马拉巴特著，魏怡译，上海译文出版社，2018年12月版，394页，52.00元
今年春夏交接以来的天气极为反常，忽然就会刮起一阵横风暴雨。在北方有人拍到了满地的冰雹，在南方的流溪河畔旋起了一股龙卷风。在这不平静的夏天，读意大利作家、记者库尔齐奥·马拉巴特（Curzio Malaparte，1898-1957）的小说《皮》（原书名La pelle，1949；魏怡译，上海译文出版社，2018年12月），似乎在冥冥之中有某种联系。其实这个中译本早在几年前就出版了，惭愧的是我到现在才读到。

作者从1943年10月1日美军第五集团军占领那不勒斯的历史背景开始讲述，书中的“我”的身份是盟军登陆后在意大利游击队与盟军指挥部之间的联络官，名字也是马拉巴特。这部小说就是脱胎于作者本人的真实经历，在书中通过联络官马拉巴特的第一人称口吻讲述了他在跟随盟军从那不勒斯到罗马的进军过程中的所见、所闻、所思。

“解放”与“占领”、“胜利者”与“失败者”是全书一开始的第一个主题，也是贯穿于全书的反思战争与人性的主线之一。在某种我们曾经熟习的战争史与战争文学叙事中，“解放”与“胜利”通常只有一种固化的观念维度和美学风格，历史被纯化为一幅色彩鲜艳、气氛热烈的宣传海报；即便在某些新学术话语的包装中显得较为精致和更有文本化，但是其扁平的实质并没有改变。《皮》从一开始就颠覆了这种“解放叙事”，把读者引领到二战结束前夕意大利的真实历史语境中去。马拉巴特曾经行进于真实的战争泥淖中，视野中的血污与废墟不是胜利者“解放叙事”中的审美点缀，而是观察与反思的真实原点。他的身份和经历不仅使他成为具有鲜明异质性的反战文学作者，而且成为战争废墟中的欧洲文明的现代主义守夜人。

库尔齐奥·马拉巴特的原名是Kurt Erich Suckert，…]]></summary>

《张尔田书札》，梁颖等整理，上海人民出版社2021年11月版，332页，58.00元

张尔田
近年来，学术界关于清末民初著名学者张尔田的文献收集整理颇有进展，其中《张尔田集》（黄山书社，2018）的整理出版与《张尔田全集》（上海大学出版社，2018）的影印出版，为我们研究张尔田提供了很方便的史料基础，但两种文集内容重合度较高，且皆有明显疏漏，尤其是漏收了大量散落于各处的张尔田信札。

上海人民出版社新近推出的这本梁颖等人整理的《张尔田书札》，收罗广泛，拾遗补缺，除了辑出部分原被收入已刊张尔田文集中的若干信函之外，还四处收罗，从已经出版的文献中发现不少张之信函，更努力从上海图书馆、国家图书馆、苏州博物馆、民国以来报刊及各公开出版物、最近的拍卖图片宣传中挖掘到若干张尔田信札（个别如致夏孙桐等的信函未标注出处），由此可以大大弥补之前两种文集的缺陷，非常便于我们研究张尔田的学思及其交游圈。

翻阅这批信札内容不难发现，曾经师事著名学者屠寄、章钰、秦树声等人的张尔田交往圈基本局限于学界之内，同近代史上很多著名学者都有交往，了解许多学界人事内幕。因此在这批信函中，心直口快的张尔田客套话、门面语较少，常常直抒胸臆，述其所知，明确表达对时局、学风和其他学者及其研究成果的看法，很能体现其为人为学的“真性情”——喜欢较真。如他《玉谿生年谱会笺》中关于李商隐及其诗的考证解释引发后辈温廷敬、苏雪林、陈寅恪等人的不同意见后，张尔田除公开发表文章进行批评回应外，还在致陈柱、李沧萍、龙榆生、吴宓等多封公开刊登的信中反复致意（33-35页、51页、113页、278页等），不断为自己立场与观点辩护。又如张煊在《古史辨》第四编中发文质疑张尔田的墨学研究后，张尔田也致信顾颉刚批评张煊的质疑站不住脚，是“考而不据，甚且不足为据”（…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So in the last 24 hours I switched my work system from Windows based to Linux, of course with blessing from the proper people. I went with Ubuntu Budgie, compatibility with Ubuntu so I didn't have to fight with the system to make it work since this is work after all. I also love the Budgie interface, can't tell you why, I just do.
 I work in IT and even though we are a Windows shop, I rarely use the windows OS for anything at all. I have been using the Ubuntu WSL2 image for a while now or PowerShell 7.2. Very rarely does a GUI do me any good and for what little I would use it for, I have a Windows VM I can turn to or just RDP the system in a pinch. Most of my day is using the Azure CLI or PowerShell cmdlets, writing Ansible, Terraform, or Packer in vscode. Anything else I am in a browser window. 
 So my experience, losing OneDrive directly was a bit of a hit just because all of my files have been redirected to it over time. I did find a solution but I need approval through Azure AD, not a big deal for now, I can manage as is and use the web tools for what little I use Office products for.
 Thunderbird setup was a breeze for my email, slack has a snap and was up in minutes. I actually found myself working better and my workflow being more efficient very quickly. Rather than using WSL or having to jump into a VM somewhere to do whatever work/testing/building I'm doing, I could just do it local. All of the VPNs I use have native clients, which is good since I can work on getting openconnect functional while knowing I can get into critical systems as needed.
 Having been in the industry around 15 years I never expected that a switch would be this quick and easy to get back into but here I am, having switched and my workflow just works and that was shocking. It's only been a day but I see this working very well for me, especially as we move forward with our cloud goals.

        <updated>2022-06-22T20:07:32.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi HN!
I've been working on a code review app for GitHub called Crocodile for about a year. I used to work at Microsoft where we used a tool called CodeFlow for reviewing code and I missed it after I left. I know many other ex-Microsoft engineers feel the same. Here are some of the distinguishing features of Crocodile that are inspired by CodeFlow:
* Comments float above the code instead of being inline. Long discussions that are displayed inline make it really hard to review the code.
* Comment on any text selection in the file, even a single character.
* Comments don't get lost when code changes. I hate it when comments become "outdated" because I rebase or the line is edited.
I also implemented lots of features that I wish CodeFlow had which you can read more about on the blog. [1]
For those curious about the tech stack: it's mostly written in Go with Alpine.js, HTMX, and Tailwind CSS for the frontend. For storage I use PostgreSQL, S3 compatible object storage, and Redis for caching. I use Pulumi for infrastructure provisioning and Kubernetes deployments. Everything is hosted on DigitalOcean.
Feedback is welcome!

Lake City, Utah, Peter Wang introduced another entrant in the field of
in-browser Python interpreters.  The Python community has long sought a way
to be able to write Python—instead of JavaScript—to run in web browsers, and there
have been various efforts to do so over the years.  Wang announced PyScript as a new framework, built atop
one of those earlier projects, to allow
Python scripting directly within the browser; those programs have access to
much of the existing Python ecosystem as well as being able to interact
with the browser document object model (DOM) directly. 
In addition, he gave some rather eye-opening demonstrations as part of the talk.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[懒人程序员们可以付费使用 AI 代写“作业”了

GitHub 宣布它的 AI 编程助手 Copilot 将开放付费使用，开发者可支付月费 10 美元或年费 100 美元。核实过的学生和流行开源项目的维护者可免费使用。Copilot 使用公开的代码库进行训练，在开发者写代码时根据函数名等上下文自动补完后续代码。很多时候 Copilot 补充的是公开代码库中代码片段的拷贝，在设置中提供了一个选项可以关闭来自公开代码库的代码补充建议。


消息来源：GitHub



老王点评：作为一个有 20 多年编程经验的人，我觉得这对编程人员来说可能并非好事。虽然它可能帮你更快、更轻松地编程，但是也可能导致你的编程基础技能进一步被削弱。最终，Copilot 的进一步强大和程序员越来越弱的编程能力，导致最终失业的是那些依赖 Copilot 的程序员们。




开源代码项目平均有 49 个漏洞

在最新《开源安全状态》报告中发现，一个开源的项目平均有 49 个漏洞和 80 个直接依赖项。修复开源项目漏洞所需的时间也在稳步增加。早在 2018 年，修复安全漏洞平均需要 49 天，而 2021 年则需要 110 天。该报告称，只有 49% 的组织制定了开源软件开发或使用的安全策略，对于大中型公司来说仅为 27%，甚至大约 30% 的组织中没有人直接负责和解决开源安全问题。


消息来源：SNYK



老王点评：开源软件从非主流变成主流，其原本的一些小问题也逐渐形成了大问题。在所有人都开始拥抱开源的时候，反而要审慎地应用开源，要对进入严肃应用场合的开源软件进行管理，使之可以避免一些固有的缺陷和风险。




研究发现区块链的中心化风险

近日，美国国防高级研究计划局（DARPA）发布了一份名为《区块链真的是去中心化吗？》的报告，发现区块链的关键漏洞有可能危及其所谓“去中心化”理念。根据该报告，至少在过去五年中，60% 的比特币流量仅通过三个互联网服务供应商，而 55% 的比特币流量是通过 Tor 进行的。这意味着这些供应商有可能拥有“改写历史”的能力，限制某些交易。此外，大约 21% 的比特币节点正在运行一个容易受到攻击的旧版本的比特币核心客户端。


消息来源：SecurityBoulevard



老王点评：毕竟区块链也是运行在网络上的，算法上的安全并不能解决基础设施不安全的问题。值此区块链暴跌的时机，这一报告又将雪上加霜。


回音


Cloudflare 解释 说 20 日的 事故 是网络配置错误导致的。Cloudflare 称它修改网络配置本意是增加弹性，结果却导致其 4% 的网络受到影响，进而影响到它处理的大约 50% 的 HTTP 请求。]]></summary>

不久前，我们写了关于 Bottles 的文章，这是一个开源的图形应用，可以在 Linux 操作系统上轻松运行 Windows 软件和游戏。今天，我们将讨论一个类似的有趣项目。向 WineZGUI 打个招呼，它是一个 Wine GUI 前台，可以 在 Linux 上用 Wine 运行 Windows 应用和游戏。

什么是 WineZGUI？

WineZGUI 是一个 Bash 脚本的集合，它允许你轻松地管理 Wine 前缀，并在 Linux 上使用 Zenity 提供更轻松的 Wine 游戏体验。

（LCTT 译注：Wine 前缀是一个特殊文件夹，Wine 在其中放置所有 Wine 特定的文件，安装 Windows 程序、库和注册表代码，以及用户首选项。）

使用 WineZGUI，我们可以直接从文件管理器中启动 Windows EXE 文件或游戏，而无需安装它们。

WineZGUI 为每个应用或游戏创建快捷方式，以便于访问，同时也为每个 EXE 二进制文件创建单独的前缀。

当你用 WineZGUI 启动一个 Windows EXE 文件时，它会提示你是否使用默认的 Wine 前缀或创建一个新的前缀。默认的前缀是 ~/.local/share/winezgui/default。

如果你选择为 Windows 二进制文件（EXE）创建一个新的前缀，WineZGUI 将尝试从 EXE 文件中提取产品名称和图标，并创建一个桌面快捷方式。

当你以后启动相同的二进制文件（EXE）时，它将建议你用先前的相关前缀来运行它。

说得通俗一点，WineZGUI 只是一个用于官方原始 Wine 的简单 GUI。当我们启动一个 EXE 来玩游戏时，Wine 前缀的设置是自动的。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[在这篇文章中学习混沌工程的基础知识。




混沌工程是由科学、规划以及实验组成的。它是一门在系统上进行实验的学科，用来建立系统在生产中承受混乱条件能力的信心。

首先，我会在文章导论部分解释混沌系统如何工作。

如何开始学习混沌系统呢？

以我的经验，开始学习混沌系统的最好方式是触发一个此前生产中出现的事故来进行实验。使用过去的数据，制定一个计划，以相同的方式破坏你的系统，然后建立修复策略，并确认结果满足你预期。如果计划失败，你就有了一种新的实验方式，并朝着快速处理问题的新方式前进。

最重要的是，你可以随时记录所有内容，这意味着，随着时间的推移，整个系统将被完整记录下来，任何人都可以值守而无需太多加码，每个人都可以在周末好好休息。

你要在混沌工程中做什么？

混沌系统实验运行背后有一些科学依据。我记录了其中一些步骤：


定义一个稳定状态： 使用监控工具来搜集当系统没有问题或事故时，看起来功能正常的数据。

提出假设或使用先前的事故： 现在你已经定义了一个稳定状态，请提出一个关于在事故或中断期间会发生（或发生过）的情况的假设。用这个假设来得出一系列将会发生的事故，以及如何解决问题的理论。然后你可以制定一个故意引发该问题的计划。

引发问题： 用这个计划来破坏系统，并开始在真实环境中测试。收集破坏时的指标状态，按计划修复，并追踪提出解决方案所需时长。确保你把所有的东西都记录下来，以备将来发生故障时使用。

试图推翻你的假设： 实验中最精彩的部分是尝试推翻你的思考或计划。你要创建一个不同的状态，看看你能走多远，并在系统中生成一个不同的稳定状态。


确保在你在另一个系统中生成的破坏因素前，建立一个处于稳定状态的控制系统。这将使你更容易在实验前、期间和之后发现各种稳定状态的差异。

混沌工程需要什么？

这有一些初学混沌工程很好的工具：


良好的文档编制方法

一个捕捉你系统是否处于稳定状态的监控系统

Grafana

Prometheus



混沌工程工具：

Chaos mesh

Litmus

之后的文章我会介绍更多



一个假设

一个计划


去搞破坏吧

现在你已经掌握了基础，是时候去安全的摧毁你的系统了。我计划每年制造四次混乱，然后努力实现每月一次的破坏。

混沌工程是一种很好的实践，也是推进你的内部文档保持最新的好方法。此外，随着时间的推移，新升级或应用程序部署将更加顺畅，你的日常生活管理将通过 Kubernetes 变得更加轻松。

毛子水先生
毛子水先生（1893-1988）原名準，字子水，浙江江山人。关于毛先生的《论语今注今译》，可以谈的很多，得先从其他方面谈起。

他既本名毛準，为何又叫他毛子水呢？中国传统对“名”“字”一向考究，使用起来总是很谨慎。古人的名是要给上辈或高官（或政府文书）称我时使用，同辈或低辈的人，是不能连名带姓叫的，不慎叫了便是犯了“讳”，犯讳得看轻重，不小心在文章中用了当今圣上的名讳，轻者可能夺官，重者可能杀头，所以要非常小心。称正式名讳的规矩很多，所以古人在取名的时候，也顺便取了个“字”，好让一般人称呼，名通常是单的，字则多是双的，名与字通常都有意义连属的关系，这层关系有的是相承，有的是相反，譬如孔子弟子仲由字子路，欧阳修字永叔（修与永都是长的意思），算是相承，而端木赐字子贡，韩愈字退之，算是相反，这类例子，在古人俯拾皆是，无须多举。毛準字子水，是名与字含意相承的例子。

清末闹革命，很多传统文化都被推翻了，毛先生与胡适、傅斯年是同时人，在文化意识上属于革新派，他们常批评“旧”文化，认为旧文化落伍。但他们又出身传统社会，真要革新也无法全然做到，譬如说他们多依古人之例，有名也有字（胡适字适之，傅斯年字孟真），有时碰到别人直呼其名也会不高兴的，要人以字称他，别人不是不懂，就是不理，有的就干脆“以字为名”了。好在之前没有身份证，改名非常方便，在台大之前有位反胡适出名的历史系教授徐子明，他本名徐光，后来也是以字为名，改名徐子明了。

毛先生早年读北大数学系，但国学功底也很深厚，读北大时，曾带顾颉刚一起蹭章太炎校外上的课，也很有领会（见顾颉刚《古史辨·序》），后来公费到德国柏林大学深造，碰上世乱，学位没有完成，回国成了北大教授，一度兼任北大图书馆馆长，据说毛先生学问很广博，是位“百科全书式”的学者，连…]]></summary>

　　法院经审理查明，2021年7月27日晚，张国在参与宴请时与被害人周某初次相识，趁周某醉酒之机，在餐厅前台附近及包间内对周某实施猥亵行为。次日7时许，张国到周某所住酒店房间内又对周某实施猥亵行为。
　　法院认为，被告人张国违背妇女意志，趁被害人醉酒之机猥亵被害人，其行为构成强制猥亵罪。公诉机关指控张国犯强制猥亵罪的事实清楚，证据确实、充分，指控罪名成立。张国无认罪、悔罪表现，应依法惩处。据此，法院遂作出上述判决。
　　案件回顾：
　　2021年8月7日晚，阿里巴巴认证员工匿名称，自己被男领导（王成文）要求陪商家（张国）喝酒，其被灌醉后遭到猥亵。而后，该领导为女员工开了房间，其进出房间4次，并实施强奸。女员工向HR等反馈无果，前往食堂发传单维权。
　　2021年8月7日，阿里巴巴对此回应称，决不容忍，全力配合警方，涉嫌员工已停职接受警方调查。8月8日，济南华联超市就此进行回应，涉事员工停职调查。8月8日，济南公安通报“阿里女员工被侵害”事件：正在调查取证。8月8日，阿里公司员工发出倡议，筹备建立保护机制。8月9日凌晨，阿里巴巴公布处理决定，业务总裁和HRG引咎辞职，涉嫌男员工王成文被辞退永不录用。8月9日，济南华联超市回应阿里女员工被侵害事件：涉事员工张国被辞退。8月10日，“阿里女员工称被侵害”事发饭店“渔家灯火济南环宇店”店员称：警方已调查取证，包厢内无监控。
　　2021年8月14日，济南市公安局槐荫区分局发布情况通报称，根据《中华人民共和国刑法》第237条规定，犯罪嫌疑人王成文、张国因涉嫌强制猥亵罪，已被济南市公安局槐荫区分局依法采取刑事强制措施，没有证据证明有强奸犯罪事实发生。案件正在进一步侦办中。
　　2021年9月6日，山东省济南市槐荫区人民检察院经依法审查，犯罪嫌疑人王某文实施的强制猥亵行为不构成犯罪，不批准逮捕。
　　2022年6月22日，张国强制猥亵案一审宣判，以强制猥亵罪判处一年六个月。]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[对于程序员来说，掌握 Java 的内存管理机制并不是必须的，但它能够帮助你更好地理解 JVM 是如何处理程序中的变量和类实例的。


Java 之所以能够如此流行，自动 垃圾回收Garbage Collection（GC）功不可没，它也是 Java 最重要的几个特性之一。在这篇文章中，我将说明为什么垃圾回收如此重要。本文的主要内容为：自动的分代垃圾回收、JVM 划分内存的依据，以及 JVM 垃圾回收的工作原理。

Java 内存分配

Java 程序的内存空间被划分为以下四个区域：


堆区Heap：对象实例就是在这个区域分配的。不过，当我们声明一个对象时，堆中不会发生任何内存分配，只是在栈中创建了一个对象的引用而已。

栈区Stack：方法、局部变量和类的实例变量就是在这个区域分配的。

代码区Code：这个区域存放了程序的字节码。

静态区Static：这个区域存放了程序的静态数据和静态方法。


什么是自动垃圾回收？

自动垃圾回收是这样一个过程：首先，堆中的所有对象会被分类为“被引用的”和“未被引用的”；接着，“未被引用的对象”就会被做上标记，以待之后删除。其中，“被引用的对象”是指程序中的某一部分仍在使用的对象，“未被引用的对象”是指目前没有正在被使用的对象。

许多编程语言，例如 C 和 C++，都需要程序员手动管理内存的分配和释放。在 Java 中，这一过程是通过垃圾回收机制来自动完成的（尽管你也可以在代码中调用 system.gc(); 来手动触发垃圾回收）。

垃圾回收的基本步骤如下：

1、标记已使用和未使用的对象

在这一步骤中，已使用和未使用的对象会被分别做上标记。这是一个及其耗时的过程，因为需要扫描内存中的所有对象，才能够确定它们是否正在被使用。



2、扫描/删除对象

有两种不同的扫描和删除算法：

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[(I am not looking for support with this post; it is just for information.) Looks like "mounting as read-only" is not the write-proof wall one might think it is.
 After attaching an NTFS hard drive, I mouned it as read-only using mount -o remount,ro. Then I read a file's last access date using the "stat" command. It was a date in March 2022. Then, I opened that PNG file inside Firefox, ran stat on it again, and its last access time was reset (2022-06-21 22:51:09).
 I first assumed that the new last access time is just in the RAM, not on the actual drive. I disconnected the drive, reconnected it, mounted it as read-only, and the last accessed time was still 2022-06-21 22:51:09.
 This means the contents of the file system were modified despite of the read-only option. Needless to say, this made me lose trust in it, since it is not that write-proof wall I thought it is. Apparently, this behaviour is specific to NTFS, since it has not happened so far with FAT32, exFAT, or ext4. Looks like the only way to actually write-protect a drive is on controller level.
 Obviously, mount -o ro can not protect from writes by tools that access the device on block level, but file attributes are on file system level. On other file systems like FAT*, it does protect from changing last access dates, but not on NTFS.

I've configured it for "RTC in local TZ" with timedatectl so it can have the same time as Windows (I'm aware that I could change Windows via regedit to use UTC for the hwclock but I'm trying to work out the best option for a corporate rollout). The problem is that I resume from suspend and the system immediately treats the RTC as if it was in UTC thus being out by 10 hours (time zone +1000).
 How does Ubuntu get the time from the RTC on resume? Any clues as to where to look would be really appreciated. I've done Google searches and found nothing helpful. Even if you just know which program does it that would help a lot, I could read the source.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In the final filesystem session at the
2022 Linux Storage,
Filesystem, Memory-management and BPF Summit (LSFMM), David Howells led
a discussion on a filesystem optimization that is causing various kinds of
problems.  Extent-based filesystems have data structures that sometimes do
not reflect the holes 
that exist in files.  Reads from holes in sparse files (i.e. files with
holes) must return zeroes, but filesystems are not obligated to maintain knowledge of
the holes  beyond that, which leads to the problems.

This concludes our coverage of LSFMM 2022.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I made a bug report on the KDE bug tracker regarding the massive regression that happened in 5.25 regarding animations on high-refresh-rate monitors and there hasn't been so much as a peep about it in a week. I realize that delays of several years is common and accepted in the open source world, but I would like this to get fixed before I die, so I'd like to start a bug bounty. How/where do I go about doing that, and how do I make the KDE devs aware that it exists?

I know in Windows adobe reader and foxit can without issue but so far I have had no luck finding something that isn't Libre Draw (don't want to use it because it fucks up the formatting a lot or goofs fonts and I just need to print a pdf as is, but in booklet, not make edits to it) that can do this seemingly simple task.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have an offsite server, a Synology Diskstation. Every week or so I get into it, fire up Docker, spin up an instance of Ubuntu, and rsync everything in a single directory with an external USB drive hooked up to the unit. It may sound weird but it works for my needs.
 However, I don't get how it goes so fast. From week to week I'll at most have a gig or two move from the Diskstation to the external drive. However, it goes far faster than I think it should and I'd like to know what I'm missing here. 
 The directory in question has ~400k files and is 4.5 Tb. Beyond the (variable) amount of time required to move the new files it seems to spend far less time than I imagine it should hashing both source and target directories. The Diskstation isn't exactly a performance machine and I've got 8 5400 RPM drives in it as a SHR-2 volume on BTRFS so it can be slow. The external drive was just the cheapest 8Tb money can buy. 
 Reading all those files would take hours. Reading the external would take more hours. Why doesn't it take hours? Does rsync not actually verify the contents of files and rely on metadata or something?
