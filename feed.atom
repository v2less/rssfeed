 Arch is the ONLY os installed on the laptop, is there anyway I can hide or disable the systemd boot menu selector? So it just boots right up?
 If I need to ever fix anything or use the fallback image I'm fully fine just booting from a live USB and using chroot.

 I am new to servers and would like to begin learning about the world of Linux by running a Home based server. At the moment, I have 4 drives to start with. 2x2tb and 2x2tb. What would you recommend to begin with? I have been thinking about Ubuntu Server, however if anyone can let me know any alternatives then that would be great? 
 The purpose of the server would be hosting websites, docker containers etc. 
 The purpose of my learning exercise would be to prepare me for a job in IT.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When I first got interested in Linux, the only way to run any Windows software was Wine, and you'd be lucky if some games maybe worked sometimes. I know that things have moved on a lot, and it's very difficult to keep up. It feels like the timeline has been:
 2010 - Some games might be barely playable in Wine with a lot of fiddling
 2020 - Now there's this amazing new distro called A/B/C which is really well preconfigured for running games.
 2021 - What's the point in ABC when you can get really good drivers now in any distro
 2022 - Ha, what peasants we were before, now there's this incredible new software which lets you magically play any Windows game with amazing performance, even better than Windows
 2023 - What a joke, now there's XYZ solution, which literally lets you run any software on any system, and completely turns everything you thought you knew about Linux upside down, and you now you don't even know anything anymore.
 ?2024 - Just give up and throw away your computer and go and live in a cabin in the woods because you've gone mad.
 It literally does feel like that, and I've just completely lost track of these incredible new developments over the last few years, and so many of them seem like they really do change the entire paradigm of what Linux even is (at least the way people talk about them). And there seem to be so many competing magical solutions that I don't even know where to start.
 So if I wanted to run say the new Hitman games, and say, Sim Tower or Caesar 3, and also Halo Infinite, what's the best super magical doohickey these days? I know this is not r/linuxquestions(!), but to me this is less of a how a 'how do I solve this specific technical problem' question, and more of a 'what the heck is even going on these days in the bigger picture' sort of question.

Seven years ago, I complained about Salesforce on HN. Somebody said: "one day, someone will do better". That stuck and today we're trying to be that “someone” with my co-founders Thomas (design) and Charles (eng like me). Our company is called Twenty and our repo is here: https://github.com/twentyhq/twenty
We want to fix two issues: most CRMs aren't enjoyable to use and they often clash with engineering teams.
YC encouraged us to launch early. What you see now is about two months' worth of feature development. Our tool only does a small part of what big CRM players offer, but we focused on providing a great user experience on the basics, instead of spreading ourselves thin across a vast range of features and delivering them half-heartedly.

 Back in 2018, as I was getting into physics school, I bought my first computer: a Dell Inspiron 15 3000, which I absolutely loved. Soon enough, I started getting irritated by Windows, so I decided to give Linux a try, and I have been a Linux user since then. I removed the DVD drive and replaced it with an SSD running Linux. The only reason I didn't wipe the original drive was that I needed Windows for Bias FX, which doesn't work with Wine (or at least I haven't been able to make it work). Ad…]]></summary>

 I made this color picker using PyQt5 mainly because I was missing a decent & minimal magnifying coloring picking tool. I’ve been quite pleased with it so far, so I thought I’d publish it on github for anyone that might be looking for the same thing I was.
 Hope you like it :)

Meta 周二发布了 Llama 2：这是一套经过预训练和微调的基于文本的人工智能模型，有三种不同的规模，分别包含 70 亿、130 亿和 700 亿个参数。与之前的 LLaMA 模型不同的是，任何人都可以申请下载 Llama 2，开发人员可以用它来构建商业产品或服务，以及开展有趣的项目。Meta 表示，不会对访问或使用其开发的模型收费，而是通过向其他公司开放该技术，如与微软和亚马逊合作，在 Azure 和 AWS 上提供该模型。值得注意的是，Llama 2 采用了专门的 许可证，有一些独特的限制，因此不符合“开源”的定义。除了常见的免责声明外，开发人员不能利用其输出结果来改进其他类型的大型语言模型。以及，如果将 Llama 2 用于支持那些拥有超过 7 亿月活跃用户的应用程序的大公司，必须申请使用 Meta 技术的特殊许可。


消息来源：The Register



老王点评：虽然不是规范定义的“开源”软件，但至少是开放的。值得注意但是，从 LLaMA 到 Llama 2，Meta 都采用了非同寻常的“开源”方式，这或许是 Meta 既想利用开源的优势，又有一些不确定的担忧。也许人工智能领域需要一种独特的开放许可证。

该计划的正式名称为《美国网络信任标识》，旨在帮助美国人确保他们购买的互联网连接设备具有强大的网络安全保护措施，可防范网络攻击。长期以来，物联网一直被认为是网络安全的薄弱环节。符合该标准的设备将要求具有唯一且强大的默认密码、保护存储和传输的数据、提供定期的安全更新以及具备事故检测能力等。

老王点评：越来越多的物联网设备，其实是埋在信息社会底层的空洞，你不知道它什么时候就会导致塌陷。




印度大部分外包程序员将在两年内因人工智能而消失

Stability AI 公司的 CEO 表示，印度的大多数外包程序员将在未来一两年内失业。不过他认为，在法国等受《劳动法》保护较强的国家受到这种影响的可能性较小。他重申了他之前的说法，五年后将 “不再有程序员”，不过，他也说明，他指的是传统意义上的程序员。他说，“当你把编程这件事从错误测试、单元测试到构思进行解构时，人工智能可以做到这一点，而且做得更好。但这不是自动完成的，而是人工智能‘辅助驾驶’完成的。”

老王点评：其实也不用特别慌，就像计算器、计算机出现，并没有让原来的财务和文员失业一样，只是如果你掌握不了新工具，那这种“古典程序员”被淘汰也是自然的。]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[当你开始在桌面上使用 Linux 时，你可能会选择像 Ubuntu 或者 Linux Mint 这样的 对初学者友好的发行版。

随着你逐渐熟悉 Linux 并且开始喜欢上它，你会加入各种社交渠道上的 Linux 相关社区，关注分享 Linux 内容的网站。而当你这样做的时候，你也会发现一些新的、相对不知名的发行版。

因为你对这个领域还比较陌生，你可能会被诱惑尝试一个接一个的发行版，从而陷入“发行版快闪”的陷阱。



于是你开始问自己这个问题：“我应该使用一个未知的发行版，还是像大多数人那样使用流行的发行版呢”？

简单的答案是坚持使用主流的发行版，但真正的答案需要你自己思考。

使用新的、较为冷门的发行版存在的问题

使用“全新的、个人开发者的发行版”存在一个主要问题，那就是不确定性。你无法确定这个项目将会存在多久。可能是一年，也可能是一个月。

我曾经见过几个发行版出现这种情况。比如，SemiCode OS 由于为程序员而创建而变得流行。类似的发行版 Emperor OS 最近消失了。这只是被停止开发的发行版长列表中的几个例子。

你可能会说，一个有一定用户基础的旧发行版也可能出现同样的情况。这是对的，但通常情况下，有一个社区和多个开发者参与项目。这样你就有一定的保证。

由于开发者的经验不足，新的发行版可能会缺失关键功能。例如，在撰写本文时，看起来令人惊艳的 Garuda Linux 官方并不推荐双启动。



尽管 Garuda Linux 拥有相当数量的支持者和几名开发者参与项目，但仍存在这个问题。

大多数新的发行版没有提供实质性的内容

你经常会遇到一些全新的发行版，它们基于一些其他流行的发行版，比如 Ubuntu 或 Arch Linux。唯一的不同可能只在于默认的应用程序、主题和壁纸。

如果它是一个“面向程序员的发行版”，它可能会默认安装一些编程应用程序。如果它是一个“游戏发行版”，它可能会默认安装一些工具，如 Steam、Wine 和 Lutris。你不太可能在图形或硬件方面看到真正的优化。

这就是为什么很多人说，已经有了数百个发行版的拥挤空间中，我们不需要更多的发行版。毕竟，在主流发行版中安装所需的应用程序并不难。

我反对这些新的发行版吗？

绝对不是。

你可能会觉得几乎没有提供任何价值的新发行版是多余的。你可能是对的，因为这些项目可能对你来说无关紧要，但对于开发它的人来说，它们是重要的。

你有没有试过学习一门编程语言？第一个教程通常是一个“Hello World”的程序。即便是高级程序员也是从“Hello World”开始的。

婴儿不会直接开始跑步。到达那个阶段需要时间。

我对这些项目的看法也是一样的。如果有人热爱 Linux 并且对创建自己的“操作系统”感到兴奋，就让他们去做吧。如果你不想鼓励他们，也不要泼冷水。

大多数项目都是从相同的方式开始的。Linux Mint 是一款非常受欢迎的 Linux 发行版。它于 2006 年开始，并以 Kubuntu 为基础。

真的需要“一个基于 Ubuntu 的类似发行版”吗？实际上并不需要。但看看 Linux Mint 如今的地位。

那么，你应该使用新的发行版还是不应该使用呢？

总体而言，这取决于你自己。

如果你不喜欢频繁格式化你的系统，并且希望继续正常生活，那就坚持使用主流的发行版。

如果你喜欢实验，不介意频繁更换操作系统并且愿意冒着搞乱系统的风险，那么你可以尝试新的发行版。就个人而言，我建议你在虚拟机中尝试它们。如果你能有一台空闲的系统专门用于实验，那就更好了。

你也可以使用那些在社区中存在多年，但不如 Ubuntu、Mint、Fedora 和 Debian 等发行版流行的发行版。像 PCLinuxOS、Puppy Linux、Peppermint OS 等项目拥有一个较小但活跃的社区。它们绝对是一个可靠的选择，即使用于你的主系统也没有问题。

在选择发行版时，除了基础发行版外，你还应该看看该发行版是否经常更新，并拥有一个活跃的社区。你只需要查看该项目的论坛，看看社区中是否有足够的活动即可。

你更喜欢哪种类型的发行版？

这是我在选择新的较为冷门发行版和流行的主流发行版之间提出的想法和建议。

那你呢？你更喜欢哪种类型的发行版？

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[blendOS v3 已经来到，并带来了重大升级！




blendOS 是一个 不可变发行版，它的目标（野心）是取代所有 Linux 发行版。我们最近 介绍了它 之前的版本。该项目由 Ubuntu Unity 的首席开发者 Rudra Saraswat 领导，其进展一直良好。

在最近的公告中，他们推出了一个带来了许多改进的新版本，使 blendOS 更加接近其目标。

让我们看看这个版本有什么内容。

🆕 blendOS v3 “Bhatura”：有什么新内容？



作为一个支持大多数软件包的 基于 Arch 的发行版，最新版本的 blendOS 的名字来源于印度美食中的一道美味佳肴 “印度炸麦饼”。

这个版本提供了很多东西，值得注意的亮点包括：


更好的桌面环境支持

直观的应用安装

支持附加发行版

改进的系统更新

新的命令行程序


更好的桌面环境支持



blendOS 现在 支持 7 种桌面环境，其中包括：


GNOME

KDE Plasma

Cinnamon

XFCE

Deepin

MATE

LXQt


现在支持的太多啦！ 🤯

你可以通过在终端中运行 system track 命令轻松地在这些之间切换。

直观的应用安装



此版本的 blendOS 现在提供了双击 DEB、RPM、pkg.tar.zst 甚至 APK 包将它们安装到容器中的功能。


📋 对于 APK：你需要从设置启用安卓应用支持。


支持附加发行版



blendOS 现在支持在容器中运行十个发行版，并且能够通过单用户/多用户安装 运行 NixOS。以下是支持的发行版：


Arch Linux

AlmaLinux 9

Crystal Linux

Debian

Fedora 38

Kali Linux （滚动版）

Neurodebian Bookworm

Rocky Linux

Ubuntu 22.04

Ubuntu 23.04


改进的系统更新



blendOS v3 使用 ISO 进行系统更新。 与传统发行版不同，它允许重建系统，更新大小在 10-100 MB 范围内。

多亏了 zsync，更新下载的大小才如此之小。更新在后台下载，下次启动时，当前的根文件系统将被替换，同时保持任何自定义系统包完好无损。

根据开发者的说法，此更新系统解决了 Arch Linux 等滚动发行版的重大缺陷，防止任何数据丢失或系统故障，提供了出色的稳定性。

新的命令行程序



最后，它引入了两个新的命令行程序； 一个是 system，另一个是 user。

system 将允许你安装软件包，甚至切换桌面。而 user 将使你能够创建/管理容器及其关联。

就是这样。对于此版本的亮点，你可以通过 发布公告 博客来了解有关此精彩版本的更多信息。

📥 下载 blendOS v3 “Bhatura”

blendOS v3 有七个不同的版本，从 GNOME 版本一直到 Deepin 版本。

你可以从 官方网站 获取它们，你也可以在其中查看安装指南。

I’m forced to use windows as a scientific workstation on my work computer as a government data scientist and I completely understand why, and I have no expectations that Linux will “win on the desktop”, because it doesn’t need to.
 Despite so many Linux fans out there thinking really hard /s about how the community can best strategize to have a completely open hardware and software platform take over households across the world, in all use cases, especially the ones the Linux kernel is least suited for (like RTOS applications directing self driving cars, and, no the driving subsystems of Tesla don’t run on linux, the infotainment system does), we still have really nice linux things!
 On my desktop, I can run hyprland basically flawlessly with my 3070 using proprietary nvidia drivers. I just got a steam deck and now I can play all of my favorite video games on my couch in 4K on my big ol TV with a wireless controller. I still use a pretty locked down andoid phone for many things (though an iPhone for daily use because privacy). I have a raspberry pi to serve as the data collection backend for my home brewed weather station. My TV and both of my partners TVs have Linux as their smart TV OS.
 All of these things are a mix of GPLed software and binary blobs/closed source elements. It’s amazing just how robust the corporate environment for Linux really is and how it drives innovation and competition.
 And Debian is also a thing, I guess. Kinda.
 The truly best thing about Linux is how all the really serious developers aren’t ESR or RMS. They’re actually rational, successful people. The zealots lost the argument and we’re all better for it.
 It’s nice to have nice things.

陈以侃在毛姆短篇集的译后记里说：“最早应该算是上了香港一位董先生的当：中学时的特长是熟读各种董桥文集，一直认定这世上写英文是没有人写得过毛姆的。”他还说董先生的《从前》他读得最熟，淡淡的气氛里，鲜明的人和事，和毛姆太像了。和董先生一样，陈以侃大学念的是英文系，相信他一定是用功读过好几代人的英美文学作品才有了发现自己“上当”的本事，才敢说自己上了董先生的“当”。我比陈以侃虚长十几岁，算起来他在中学里熟读董先生文集的年代应该也是我开始追读董先生文章的年代，快二十年了，我没陈以侃那么长进，不觉得自己上过董先生的“当”，倒是一直中着董先生的“毒”，无药可救，也乐此不疲。

“考古学”是不是一门外来的学问，乃现代中国学术史上最具争议性的问题之一。1926年10月，瑞典皇太子古斯塔夫访华。这位爱好考古的“边缘”大人物之所以到中国来，缘于他的朋友安特生在中国的数年调查发掘，为斯德哥尔摩成为世界首屈一指的中国古代艺术品收藏地贡献巨大。北京学界激动之余，安排了一系列活动，以展现“现代学术”在中国的发展面貌。其中当然以安特生公布在周口店的最新发现——古人类遗存为重头戏。梁启超作为中国学界领袖、新史学巨擘，也发表了演讲，题目是《中国考古学之过去及将来》。他一改常态，只字不提“欧洲考古学会”与“物质上之公例”，而是细数中国过去尤其是清代，四部分类中所谓“小学”与“金石”等门类的成果，称中国考古学过去已有如此辉煌成就，将来与发掘等现代技术结合，前途无量。
一个月后，梁启超在清华研究院的同事王国维到中外人士聚集的北京历史社会学会演讲《宋代之金石学》，表彰宋人于古器物有“多方面之兴味”，元明清至今，“反有所不逮”，因此谓“金石学为有宋一代之学”。大约再过了一个月，梁启超在清华研究院的另一位同事李济结束田野调查回京，在课堂上把《中国考古学之过去及将来》这篇报告向同学们一摊，说道：“这是中国人的所谓考古学。”

梁启超

梁启超不是不懂从前国人的考古学与欧洲的考古学有何区别，否则他也不会先后把梁思成、梁思永送到美国去喝洋墨水。只是话既出口，有如覆水难收。当时不得不如此苦心孤诣，渐与背景割离。何况甲骨文金文的研究，经过王国维“二重证据法”论说的发挥，仿佛代表了更广泛的考古证据之前奏。这一思路流衍至今，便追踪到了清代朴学与考据方法：传统学人既然能够经由训诂小学而发现殷商的甲骨文字，意味着现代考古学的根本内容，其实就落脚在中国本土文化之中。

一、老虎，老虎！
这是我对中国最早的记忆：爸爸办公室三面墙都是书，弥漫着烟斗的味道。即使在半个多世纪后的今天，当我在家里翻开其中一本书，总感觉仍然可以闻到一丝当年的烟味。
我心中最早的中国还伴随着野兽——其实就是一只做成虎皮地毯的老虎，当然还带着巨大的虎头。每当六岁的我走进那间办公室，都会胆战心惊地盯着它黄色玻璃般铮亮的眼睛，和那些可怕的牙齿，好像随时会被它一口吞掉。
这块虎皮地毯铺在加州大学伯克利分校那位历史学家的办公室里。它背后还有个故事。总是有故事的：爸爸的人生就是在物质体验的瞬间发现意义。那老虎是我外祖父猎回的三只老虎之一——他送给三个孩子每人一只大猫。我妈不喜欢，不愿把它摆在家里，所以她丈夫就带到上班的地方，解决了问题。
爸爸待人接物总有一丝腼腆，同时又是个引人注目的人物，所以访客进他办公室时多少都有点敬畏。这就是为何他把虎皮摆成那样——虎头刚好落在开门的弧线之外。有些紧张的客人过分在意坐在书桌后的那位先生，往往会忽视地板上潜伏的危险，被虎头绊到。爸爸就会顺势聊起他那神枪手岳父（不是个好惹的人），如何悄悄接近他的猎物，一、二、三……气氛融洽起来，访客大笑，开口提问，讨论漫长而复杂的中国历史。于是就这样开场：一段对话，一曲智性之舞，与我的父亲约瑟夫·里奇蒙·列文森一起思考中国。
二、爸爸的玩笑
爸爸喜欢玩文字游戏，忍不住要讲双关语，经常跨越两三种语言，发明一些让人哭笑不得的笑话。他把这种文字中的游戏感，把从中挖掘每一丝意义（还有幽默）的纯粹的快乐带到了我们家的日常生活中。每天晚上，他都会哄我和弟弟睡觉。他盯着我们上床，盖好被子，关上灯。然后是讲故事的时间。这是爸爸的天赋，（现在回想起…]]></summary>

 This usually happen after kernel updates but somehow I always find a way to resolve it. I need to start being more consistent and narrow down the amount of time it takes to resolve them.
 I have installed the driver with apt-get nvidia-driver
 I have also uploaded the driver to the server with rsync where I get the driver from nvidia website 
 I often struggle with getting the the previous driver purge that has issues
 What seems to work lately is to remote to the sever and invoke multi-user mode and run the driver that I get with rsync then once complete I switch it back to graphical target
 But somehow I always have to troubleshoot some

Since a few months it stopped worikng and when trying to install it dnf reports that the gpg key is invalid . I also noticed that the linux versions are behind in version comparing to other OS. 
 It seems that anydesk is no longer interested in supporting Linux. I tried on a few occasions to report it to them but all I get is a braindead support chatbot. 
 Does someone here knows a software that does more or less the same and that supports linux. 
 My mother is in a care faciility and so I have no control over the wifi there that is why anydesk was easy.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello everyone,
 I'm a new Linux user and I have a question regarding the suitability of my machine for running Linux. I'm curious to know if this would be a good and powerful choice for running Linux smoothly. I understand that Linux doesn't necessarily require a high-end processor to perform well, but I value your input on this matter. The reason behind my inquiry is that my current laptop, which is equipped with an NVIDIA RTX 3070, tends to encounter occasional issues after software updates...
 Considering these factors, I'm contemplating a switch to an AMD-based system. Hence, I would greatly appreciate hearing your thoughts and opinions on AMD processors and their compatibility with Linux.
 As for my background, I am a simple user who is currently studying IT. I spend my free time coding and playing casual games. 
 Here is the link of this new laptop: https://wccftech.com/xiaomi-unveils-redmibook-pro-15-ryzen-edition-laptop-amd-ryzen-7-7840hs-apu/
 Thank you

 One thing I am curious about are best practices for continuous integration when building a Linux distro. Also,where does the final version live? Is there like a GitHub/GitLab-like service for Linux ISOs? Do I just get a VM and set it up like an FTP server? What's the best practices.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[To all of you only using webmail and no dedicated mail client: Most webmail proviers can ask your browser to associate mailto: links inside the browser with their website. (Firefox, Chrome). That means that all mailto: clicks inside the browser will be opened using the webmail interface.
 However, you can also open mailto: clicks outside your browser (or calls to xdg-email) in your browser. All you have to do is customize your browser's .desktop link a bit:
  cp /usr/share/applications/firefox.desktop ~/.local/share/applications/ 
 open firefox.desktop and add x-schema-handler/mailto; to the MimeType=... line and reload the database
  update-desktop-database ~/.local/share/applications 
 Now you can select your browser as your Email application in your WM settings.

questions about the realtime feature of the kernel, its status, and the Real-Time Linux
project's plans for the future.  The talk was billed as a "Q&A about
PREEMPT_RT" with a caveat: "anything except printk() and
documentation".  As might be guessed, the first two questions were on just
those topics, but there were plenty of other questions (and answers) too.
The summit was 
held in conjunction with the inaugural Embedded
Open Source Summit in Prague, Czechia at the end of June.]]></summary>

 "So in conclusion, we found that 87% of the non-trivial commits to OpenSSL in the last 12 months were from 56 people paid by their employer to work on OpenSSL. This result shouldn’t be too surprising, Open Source projects such as OpenSSL rely on commercial organisations contributing their employees’ time in order to survive."
 Is this exception? Any clue if this is true for other important GNU/Linux components?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Wayland 正在成为 Linux 图形用户界面的首选方式

越来越多的证据表明，Wayland 显示服务器可能很快就会取代 X11，成为 Linux 上最常用的 GUI 方式。比如，为苹果芯片 Mac 开发 Linux 的团队表示，他们没有足够的人力来开发 X.org 支持。被许多 Linux 应用程序和桌面使用的 Gtk 工具包的开发者说，下一个版本可能会 放弃 对 X11 的支持。Budgie 桌面的下一个版本将只支持 Wayland。KDE 6 会话 默认使用 Wayland。甚至还有人尝试让 Wayland 在 OpenBSD 上运行，而它已经可以在 FreeBSD 上使用了。


消息来源：The Register



老王点评：再想想 X.org 多少年 没有 实际开发 在进行了，连 董事会选举 都差点凑不够人。所以，是时候全面转向 Wayland 了。当然，Wayland 自己还有一些问题需要解决。




安装量超百万的 WordPress 安全插件明文记录密码

All-In-One Security（AIOS）是一款安装量超过了百万的增强 WordPress 安全性的插件，在其 5 月发布的 v5.1.9 中引入了一个错误，用户登录使用 AIOS 的网站后会以明文方式记录其密码，并将其存储在管理员可访问数据库中。上周释出的 v5.2.0 修复了该问题，并从数据库里删除了相关数据。在公告中，他们还给出了一些安全建议，其中包括已被认为是糟糕的安全实践“定期修改密码”——因为这会事实上迫使用户使用弱密码。微软认为这种做法 “古老而过时”。


消息来源：Ars Technica



老王点评：无论如何，不用明文存储密码都是最起码的安全常识。从这一点和该插件开发方给出的安全建议看，他们或许并没有真正的安全意识。




网站建设公司提供创建整个网站的人工智能工具

Wix 是网站建设领域的老牌公司。该公司发布的新人工智能网站生成工具可以让 Wix 用户描述他们的意图，并生成一个包含主页、内页、文本和图片的网站，并可以包括活动、预订等特定业务板块。在一个类似聊天机器人的界面中，该工具会询问一系列有关网站和业务性质的问题，并尝试将其转化为定制的网站模板。Wix 认为客户不会特别在意花时间定制网站外观的方方面面。


消息来源：Tech Crunch



老王点评：很多年前，开发一个网站是一件艰巨的工作，而现在，通过新的工具，开发一个网站可能就像快餐一样简单。]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ever since I started seriously using Linux a few years ago, I always used Wayland. I really liked Fedora, so I used GNOME on Wayland, I also tried using KDE for a while, but that was also on Wayland. Overall, I barely touched Xorg during this entire time. I tried booting GNOME on Xorg but my touchpad gestures stopped working, so I immediately turned it off. Why bother with it if it's the outdated display server?
 Through my Linux experience, I discovered many issues - I desperately needed fractional scaling on my 14 inch 1080p laptop, which was always a blurry nightmare and I never managed to make it usable. I also experienced some visual glitches, like windows disappearing on GNOME with multiple monitors, etc. and I always figured that that's just what the Linux experience is like.
 Fast forward to a few days ago, when I installed Arch with the i3 window manager, the first environment running on Xorg that I've seriously used. And wow. So many issues are just gone, or at least very solvable. None of my apps are blurry with fractional scaling. Everything is smooth and looks good. It's like a different world.
 Wayland has some very cool features, like the responsive touchpad gestures, and it's definitely great for the future of Linux. As of now, if you're also bothered by the issues I was, consider giving them up for a way smoother and reliable desktop experience.

 I am using cron to take care of backups. I was worried that cron might fail at some point, and I wouldn't be aware of it. To mitigate this risk, I created a script called MoniCron, which monitors the state of cron. 
 You can find the script on GitHub here: https://github.com/hkarakose/monicron
 To provide a detailed explanation of how the script works and how to use it, I wrote a blog post on Medium. You can check it out here: https://medium.com/@hkarakose/keep-your-cron-entries-safe-37fd33b2667e
 I believe this script could be helpful for others who rely on cron for their backups. I welcome your comments and suggestions to further improve it.
 Thank you for your time!

每个开发人员内心最害怕的事情是什么？在你的代码开始运行前的宁静时刻，什么最让你感到恐怖？你见过或写过最可怕的代码是什么？

错误的权限

我负责一台服务器，然后我通过 FTP 上传了一些东西。显示了一些奇怪的东西，所以我想权限可能需要改变一下。

不用说，我愚蠢地关闭了读取权限并使网站瘫痪了。（当没有人能访问时，网站就没啥用了。）

我花了几个小时才修复好。这是很多年前我在一个机构担任唯一的网页开发人员时的事情。

— Miriam Goldman

混乱的 HTML

我曾经因 WordPress 的默认主题有可用的更新而使一个客户的网站瘫痪，这个客户当时是《华尔街日报》畅销书榜上的一位作者。

他的开发人员在主题中硬编码了 HTML，而不是创建一个子主题。而我运行了更新操作。

那个年代，人们不容易实现每晚备份，所以我花了几个小时打电话给托管提供商。像分阶段发布、子主题、每晚备份或手动备份这样的东西现在都很常见，还有自动更新和手动回滚的能力。但在那个时代并不常见。

— Courtney Robertson

密钥不再秘密

我想我们中的许多人在公共代码中看到过密钥。或者另一个经典案例：我的一个朋友从开发服务器向 10 万个用户发送电子邮件。

— John E. Picozzi

Unix 混乱

这是一个 Unix 的故事。今天在 Linux 中已经修复了这个问题。

在我要向管理层进行一个重要的新组件演示的前一天，我需要更新我的代码（这是在 Git 存在之前的年代）。我进入我的主目录，找到项目目录，然后删掉了一切。不幸的是，在那个版本的 Unix 中，该命令会跟随符号链接进行删除，并且我有一个链接指向代码的最新版本（并不是所有代码都在源代码系…]]></summary>

文字的发明不但用于记录过往，而且用于描述这个世界，抒发人们的感情；写作不仅是记录与想象，更是一种视觉艺术与知识霸权；文字与写作本应是思想的仆人，但往往成了思想的主人。于是，各种表现艺术得以出现，各种文体因此产生。作为文体的“历史”和“文学”都要表达的是某种陈述、事实、寄托、想象，因此，它们之间必然会存在一种有机的联系，更何况文学与史学的前身不都是神话与传说吗？希腊神话中一切艺术不是都在接受缪斯女神监管吗？九位缪斯的说法初见于公元前八世纪田园诗人赫西俄德的《神谱》，是古希腊人通过各种艺术手法追求人类整体的真善美，是秩序、优雅、意志的化身。不管是单数的缪斯还是复数的缪斯，都用舞蹈、歌曲、诗歌来激励人类，赋予人类灵感。
今天我们把文学、史学特意隔离开，完全是近代职业化带来的弊端，职业追求的是谋生手段，而非人的整体向善。“文学是什么”“史学是什么”，这类问题在本质上是人作为世界的创造者或破坏者、人在世界中的安全性与合法性所决定的，是人类对现实世界的未来控制欲所造成的。虽然“科学工作的一项原则是知识的统一性。科学并没有国界，它总是属于全人类。不过，当它努力促进全人类在知识上的统一之时，科学同样有助于维护、确立各个民族内部在学术上的协调一致”（《从福楼拜到普鲁斯特》，232-233页，以下只标注页码）。但我想这里的“知识统一性”主要指自然学科，人文的特点就在于其个性化地看待世界，对世界的解释千差万别，少有统一性。而且人文与自然一直存在分野，虽然有人不断提出各种“第三种文化”来调和它们之间看待世界的差异，但结果基本是徒劳的。因此，我们不仅要从知识的统一性的角度来思考作为学科的史学或文学是如何发生的，也要从民族国家的角度思考差异性，“法兰西文学…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[getline() 提供了一种更灵活的方法，可以在不破坏系统的情况下将用户数据读入程序。


在 C 语言中读取字符串是一件非常危险的事情。当读取用户输入时，程序员可能会尝试使用 C 标准库中的 gets 函数。它的用法非常简单：

char *gets(char *string);


gets() 从标准输入读取数据，然后将结果存储在一个字符串变量中。它会返回一个指向字符串的指针，如果没有读取到内容，返回 NULL 值。

举一个简单的例子，我们可能会问用户一个问题，然后将结果读入字符串中：

#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>

int main()
{
  char city[10]; // 例如 "Chicago"

  // 这种方法很糟糕 .. 不要使用 gets

  puts("Where do you live?");
  gets(city);

  printf("<%s> is length %ld\n", city, strlen(city));

  return 0;
}


输入一个相对较短的值就可以：

Where do you live?
Chicago
<Chicago> is length 7


然而，gets() 函数非常简单，它会天真地读取数据，直到它认为用户完成为止。但是它不会检查字符串是否足够容纳用户的输入。输入一个非常长的值会导致 gets() 存储的数据超出字符串变量长度，从而导致覆盖其他部分内存。

 Software that burns to a drive or an SD Card, that you can put multiple ISOs onto to boot from.
 What would be the best one for this?
 Also, it would be nice if it could boot virtual drives too.

I started by installing CoolerControl, as that was the only thing I could find that worked with the fans I have(Lian Li al120 v12, connected to the included hub) and that works fine for fan speed control, but has no rgb. I was looking around online and can't seem to find anything that's compatible. I installed OpenRgb but it can't seem to detect any of the devices I have. I don't know if it's just my mistake or if my hardware just isn't compatible. Any fixes or alternatives would be greatly appreciated, I'll update if I find anything, Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I want to know what is under the hood regarding the Standard Input, Standard Output, and Standard Error.
 I know at an abstraction level that they are streams of data, but what does that really mean?
 Take for example the printf of the C programming language:
  
The program, running on the processor, encounters the printf statement.
 The printf function is called and its execution beings.
 The prinf function internally uses system calls provided by the OS to interact with the stdout stream.
 The OS handles the routing of the data to the terminal (or any output file that is specified).
  
 Here I imagine that the printf function writes to a data strucure that the OS manages, and the OS reads from this data structure and writes to the terminal or a file. 
 And I imagined this based on a similar case in FreeRTOS where I would write to a queue data structure and then pop from it. 
 So where is does the "everything in Linux is a file fall in"?
  
In this article by IBM it describes them as files that a process is able to write/read to/from it, but when I try to access those files in the following directory /dev/fd/ I am encountered that those aren't files.

What happened to that alternate future? Are companies still working on it? Or did we move on from that idea for some reasons we discovered?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I see many people talking about choosing the right hardware to run Linux and I always thought there were exaggerating. I was so wrong.
 Recently I decided to build a new PC and since I was using Linux on my laptop I thought "Well, if I am building a new machine why not make it fully compatible with Linux?"
 So I did it. Every single part of my build has good support for Linux. AMD Ryzen, ATI Radeon, etc., etc... I could not be happier. Everything works just as it was supposed to. I am running Fedora with Wayland and it has been an amazing experience.
 Newcomers to Linux should know that: If you just bought your PC it probably was designed to run Windows or MAC. Most companies do not care about Linux (yes, I am talking to you Nvdia). It does not mean that it won't run Linux, it just means that it has a great chance of not being a good experience and random problems will happen. Everything on Linux was made by people who dedicate some of their time to making things work because companies do not. They do an amazing job, but it is not the same as having all info necessary. Sure, your system can run very well, but it will never be as good as a well-thought Linux-compatible PC.
 You do not have to build one. Just find a company that sells laptops for example with full Linux support and you will be amazed by how good it is .
 ​
 TL;DR: To get the whole Linux experience you have to care about hardware as well.

Ever experienced a production outage due to changes in upstream data sources? That's a problem we regularly encountered whether deploying machine learning or keeping a datawarehouse operational and it led us to create Grai.
Systematically testing the impact of data changes on the rest of your stack turns out to be quite difficult when the same data is copied and used across many different services and applications. Simple changes like renaming a column in a database can result in broken BI dashboards, incorrect training data for ML models, and data pi…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I still don't understand whether Wayland is actually the devil or the future for Linux desktop. I tried it a couple months ago on KDE with my Nvidia card, and surprisingly it ran pretty well and was much smoother than X11, a few minor graphical glitches aside. 
 What concerns me is that there's so many conflicting opinions on Wayland. Some say it has been flawed and broken from the start and some say that it's actually pretty good. 
 A couple of examples.. 
 https://serebit.com/posts/wayland-is-pretty-good/
 https://dudemanguy.github.io/blog/posts/2022-06-10-wayland-xorg/wayland-xorg.html
 Classic example of these two conflicting opinions. At this point, I just don't know what side to trust. If Wayland is truly so bad, then us being stuck with X11 doesn't sound good for the future of Linux desktop at all, considering that it's painfully obvious X11 is not even designed for modern computing. Any thoughts?

 Further i really need to work in ML, so would not enjoy being limited in this field because of my OS selection

I am not liking it that much and I want to change. Since I don't have a regular connection I prefer a distro that doesn't update as much as a rolling release. So I am uncertain between Opensuse Leap (whivh I never user, I am a Tumbeweed user in another laptop) and MxLinux, which I used some time ago and found really good. MxLinux 23 is still in beta, but Opensuse Leap has an uncertain future, as far as I understood (or am I wrong?). 
 So, what do you suggest? Leap or MxLinux 23 still in beta?
 Thank you for any suggestion Paola

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[开源硬件公司正在向封闭转变

在过去 15 年里，创新型电子公司设计并发布了数以千计的开源硬件设计，创造了一个蓬勃发展的产业。他们还集体创作并签署了《开源硬件定义》，为这些产品给出了明确的定义和标准。然而，最近一些开源硬件公司要么封闭源代码，要么推迟发布源代码，要么要求签订 NDA 才能获得“开源”的硬件及其软件。去年悄悄完成 3200 万美元融资的开源硬件公司 Arduino 修改了自己的开源承诺，删除了 “所有 Arduino 板都是完全开源的，……软件也是开源的……” 的话语。SparkFun 采用了闭源固件，需要 NDA 才能查看其代码，并申请撤销其销售的一款产品的开源硬件认证。开源 3D 打印公司 Prusa 以开源名义销售的产品，由于担忧“克隆品”而一直没有发布相应的源代码，并指责中国制造商利用其设计和源代码制造专有的闭源产品，还对从他们的开源代码中获取的设计和算法申请专利。


消息来源：Adafruit



老王点评：无论是开源软件，还是开源硬件，资本一旦涉入，开源的味道就会变化。很多靠开源起家的公司，最后背离开源，或许无奈，或许是主动选择。开源的理念，可能他们自己也不一定真心相信。




人工智能检测器认为《美国宪法》是由人工智能编写的

尽管依靠人工智能工具来检测人工智能生成的作文很有诱惑力，但迄今为止的证据表明，这些工具并不可靠。由于存在假阳性，GPTZero、ZeroGPT 和 OpenAI 自己的文本分类器等人工智能写作检测器无法检测由 ChatGPT 等大型语言模型组成的文本。如果你将美国最重要的法律文件《美国宪法》输入这种检测工具中，它会告诉你该文件几乎肯定是由人工智能撰写的。同样的情况也发生在《圣经》选段中。


消息来源：Ars Technica



老王点评：简单来说，这些人工智能的模型就是基于这些成例的文本训练而成的，自然无法区别这些事实上由人撰写的文件，而认为这些文本和人工智能生成的非常相近。这篇来源详细介绍了更多细节，感兴趣的话可以看看。




出现用于网络犯罪的人工智能 WormGPT

以 OpenAI 聊天机器人 ChatGPT 为代表的生成式 AI 能生成类似人类的文本，网络罪犯可利用它自动创建高度可信的钓鱼邮件，对收件人高度定制，增加攻击的成功率。网络罪犯甚至创建了专门用于恶意目的的工具 WormGPT。WormGPT 是基于 2021 年开发的大模型 GPTJ，它的功能包括无限字符支持、聊天记忆保留和代码格式化等。开发者声称 WormGPT 使用了恶意程序相关的数据进行训练。


消息来源：Slash Next



老王点评：要是什么地方对新技术的利用最积极，那要数这些可以用来牟利的非法领域了。]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[电子邮件服务将会一直存在，即便去中心化技术会接管互联网。

然而，随着大型科技公司试图控制新兴技术的方方面面，你如何掌控自己的电子邮件服务呢？

无论是企业还是个人，自托管的开源 Web 邮件服务始终是值得考虑的选项。你自己的服务器、你自己的数字基础架构，上面搭上你自己的电子邮件服务平台。这样，你就无需依赖供应商或第三方来管理你的电子邮件服务。你可以按照自己的方式办事。

为什么应该自托管电子邮件服务？



自托管一个可用作基于 Web 的电子邮件客户端或与电子邮件应用程序同步的服务，这不是点击一下就完成的过程。

那么，为什么要这么费事呢？难道你不能使用一些诸如 Proton Mail 和 Tutanota 之类的 注重隐私的最佳电子邮件服务 吗？

当然可以。

但是对于企业来说，自托管 Web 邮件的一些优势包括：


用户可以完全掌控电子邮件数据。

你可以自己构建符合电子邮件服务要求的基础设施。

它为个人、小型企业和企业提供了可扩展性。

你可以创建无限数量的电子邮件帐户和邮件别名。

用户可以轻松应用高级过滤器和其他保护机制，无需付费订阅。


在这里，我列出了一些你可以选择的最佳选项。

1、Roundcube



主要亮点：


适合桌面使用

持续维护

大多数服务器托管提供商都提供

可自定义的用户界面

PGP 加密


Roundcube 是一款流行的基于 PHP 的 Webmail 软件，提供简单的用户界面和所有基本功能。

大多数服务器托管提供商都已预安装它。你只需为你的域名配置它或创建电子邮件帐户即可开始使用。

你还可以在自己的服务器上安装并自定义它。

《旷奥园林意》，冯纪忠著，湖南美术出版社，2022年11月出版，168页，88.00元

位于上海市松江区老城区中山东路南侧的方塔园于1978年开始筹建，1981年初步建成，是在原兴圣教寺的遗址上建立起来的。方塔园建设工程由中国现代建筑奠基人、中国城市规划专业及风景园林专业教育的创始人、同济大学的冯纪忠先生（1915-2009）负责总体规划。其中何陋轩被普利茨克奖获得者王澍誉为“近几十年来，中国最好的现代建筑”。
去年，湖南美术出版社出版了冯纪忠先生的《造园记：与古为新方塔园》和《旷奥园林意》二书，它们根据冯先生晚年有关设计建造方塔园的口述回忆整理而成。近日，建筑艺术评论家、画家王明贤，建筑师、清华大学建筑学院副教授周榕，北京大学社会学系教授渠敬东，中央美术学院人文学院教授李军，北京建筑大学建筑与城市规划学院教授金秋野一同研讨了冯纪忠先生其人、其书、其园。

冯纪忠晚年在何陋轩

王明贤：中国实验建筑始于方塔园北大门
在现在的建筑大潮中，冯纪忠先生是一个建筑史上的被遗忘者、失踪者，现在可能有很多人不知道他。但我认为，冯先生是中国这一百年来最杰出的建筑学家，他设计的方塔园和何陋轩，是中国这一百年来最杰出的建筑。不仅在中国，何陋轩在世界建筑史上，也是非常精彩的作品。冯先生也是中国现代建筑、城市规划、园林景观的百科全书，之前还没有一个人像他这样做过如此全面的研究。

方塔园与何陋轩

更重要的是，冯先生对中国现代建筑的发展、对中国改革开放以来新一代建筑师、对中国实验建筑都产生了极大的影响。上世纪九十年代开始兴起的中国实验建筑，其中的代表像王澍、刘家琨，以及后来的朱锫、董豫赣等，都受惠于冯先生。王澍拿到普利兹克奖，冯先生便是普利兹克奖得主的精神导师。八九十年代，整个中国主流建筑师…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[在本系列的第四章，学习在 Bash 中使用基本数学运算。


你可以使用 Bash 脚本做很多事情。对变量执行简单的算术运算就是其中之一。

Bash shell 中算术运算的语法如下：

$((arithmetic_operation))


假设你必须计算两个变量的总和。你这样做：

sum=$(($num1 + $num2))


(()) 内空格的使用没有限制。你可以使用 $(( $num1+ $num2))、$(( $num1+ $num2 )) 或者 $(( $num1+ $num2 ))。它们都一样。

在通过示例详细讨论之前，我先分享一下它支持的算术运算符。

Bash 中的基本算术运算符

以下是 Bash shell 中算术运算符的列表。




运算符
描述




+
加法


-
减法


*
乘法


/
整数除法（不带小数）


%
模除法（仅余数）


**
求幂（a 的 b 次方）




🚧 Bash 不支持浮点数（小数）。你必须使用其他命令（例如 bc）来处理它们。


Bash 中的加法和减法

让我们通过编写一个脚本来看看它，该脚本从用户那里获取两个数字，然后打印它们的总和和减法。

#!/bin/bash

read -p "Enter first number: " num1
read -p "Enter second number: " num2

sum=$(($num1+$num2))
sub=$(($num1-$num2))
echo "The summation of $num1 and $num2 is $sum"
echo "The substraction of $num2 from $num…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi there! I study software development over 2 years now, and I'm willing to change my Windows 11 for a Linux distro now. Even though I'm sure about this change, I can't decide wich distro use. So far the only thing I'm sure about is that I'll choose an ubuntu based one.
 On my research I narrowed down to 2 options: Pop os and Zorin os.
 The thing that bums me out about Zorin Os is the fact that Zorin Group seems to take a lot of time to release a new update to their OS. And the thing that bums me out about Pop os is that they're about to change gnome for cosmic, and I don't know what to expect from this change. Will it be worse than gnome? I don't really know.
 But after all, I realize that for coding I won't have any big difference between theese two or any other distro. I just want to go for the one with the easiest usage for my daily activities.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am using ubuntu on WSL2. I have installed a WSLtty terminal emulator as well. Now, I can see two emulators, one is Ubuntu's default and the second one is WSLtty. If I check "echo $0" and "echo $TERM" both return the same result. ( I have attached a picture for reference. )
 How can I get the terminal emulator name using the command line. ?
 And, why do both emulators return xterm-256colour ? what is happening under the hood? Please explain.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Here's my current situation.
 - I have flashed and installed arch to a usb thumb / flash drive only (no ssd)
 - I chose GRUB as my bootloader
 ​
 Is it possible to have multiple OS/Distros on the same thumb drive (multiboot), while keeping all the settings and installed apps for each seperate OS / Distro installed?
 Ideally without deleting the already installed arch/hyprland
 Any help is appreciated, thanks.

 The first release just dropped!
 Currently only x86_64 is supported, though ARM and possibly PPC will come later.
 Please check it out if you have time!
 It aims to be zero compromises, using BusyBox, Runit and Musl. It is a fork of void built from the start to be fast, stable, minimalist, yet still good for desktop, server and even embedded use!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Basically I installed Ubuntu on an external SSD so I can boot into it in pretty much any computer. Everything is working but only when I booted back to live USB, i found out I could modify the partition easily. I think it is a huge vulnerability.
 I made some minimal changes to the installation, like installing one or two packages and updating. So it isn't hard to reinstall and set everything up again. The problem is I am afraid it will cause additional writes to SSD and therefore reducing lifespan. (I know it's negligible and the one I am using isn't from a random brand.)
 So, is it worth it to perform a reinstall with encryption? Also what encryption should I use as a balance between performance and security?
 Btw, should I encrypt the EFI partition (/boot/efi) on the external SSD? I think I need to encrypt partitions instead of entire disk because I also have other partitions. Please guide me through the process briefly as well.

If you're facing problems getting GPT to adhere to a schema (JSON, XML, etc.) or regex, need to bulk process some unstructured data, or generate synthetic data, check it out.
We run our own tuned model (you can self-host if you want), so, we're able to have incredibly fine grained control over text generation.

 In this issue, I wrote about my experience teaching computers to non-users, how to typeset music in LaTeX, the advantages (and sometimes disadvantages) of using open source software (spoiler: the advantages far outweigh the disadvantages), Ubuntu 22.04 issues (and why I won't be upgrading to 24.04 as quickly as I did to 22.04), and how to install LaTeX on Ubuntu (one way of which is probably a best practice the other way which probably isn't).
 And as the whole point of this project was for me to learn LaTeX, I also provide a brief introduction for other people who would like to learn LaTeX (although I left out how to compile a .tex file into a .pdf), and some things I learned while working on yet another LaTeX project. 
 You can read it for free here, along with the other LaTeX projects I've worked on. Feedback is welcome.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Two months back I had posted about DistroSea, website I created for exploring and testing Linux distributions online. I got very good feedback and I was working on improving the service addressing user requests and resolving reported issues. Today, I'm very excited to share that the update is now live. Some of the major improvements include:
  
Expanded Collection: Explore over 400 distro versions, including various End-of-Life releases 
 Internet is enabled for signed-in users (most requests was for this). It's now possible download and install software packages in the VM.
 Better usability on small screen devices, allowing keyboard input and easy scrolling the VM screen.
 Login credentials and instructions are displayed for some distros to easily enter into live mode
 Improvements to minimize latency while accessing VMs.
  
I have also received requests to enable disks in the VMs to try out the installation process. However, it is not currently feasible due to cost concerns.
 Many thanks to everyone who donated and sent their valuable suggestions. I hope you all will find the updates useful. Check it out now at DistroSea- Test drive Linux distros online
 Note: Do not access personal data inside the VMs. Please shutdown the VM after use to immediately allocate the server resources for another user.
 I'm currently looking for sponsors. Please get in touch if you are interested in backing my work.

 Any piece of regular software can be studied and reproduced by looking at its source code. How can an AI mode be made open source and open to scrutiny?
 Bonus question: Can information be forgotten by AI? For example, Google announced that all information on the internet will now be used to train their AI. Can that violate an individuals right to be forgotten per EU law?

 Hey there folks!
 With some friends we were comparing Calibri to Aptos, Grandview, Seaford, Skeena, and Tenorite. I posted my write-up online[1] and was discussing it on Reddit[2], among other places.
 It seems, however, that Office 365 is rendering quite a few of Calibri Regular characters, but not Calibri Light, using Lato on Linux systems. This doesn't affect MacOS, which doesn't have Calibri installed by default, nor Calibri Light, which looks and works as expected on Office 365 also when accessed from Linux Systems.
 Can some of you friendly folk with access to Office 356 upload a screenshot of what you see when you format the words "Calibri Regular" with Calibri and Calibri Light on Word (at 18px) and Power Point (at 96px)?
 The curiosity is killing us :)
 Thanks !

最近，在红帽限制其 RHEL 源代码的访问之后，整个社区围绕这件事发生了很多事情。周五，CentOS 项目董事会发出了一篇模糊不清的简短博文，文中称，“发展社区并让人们更容易做出贡献是成功的关键因素。我们对与 CentOS 项目合作的兴趣感到兴奋。”并说他们今年以来一直在制定一套指导方针，“以帮助定义 CentOS 及其交付成果的成功含义”，还表达了对新贡献者的欢迎。除了这篇模糊不清的博文外，未见到进一步的明确信息。


消息来源：CentOS



老王点评：CentOS 项目还活着？要不是这篇博文，我以为他们已经不存在了呢。这算是对社区的抗议的反击吗？




利用微软证书签发的恶意驱动多达数千个

微软本周早些时候警告称，Windows 硬件开发者计划认证的一些驱动程序正在被恶意利用。为了应对恶意驱动程序的威胁，从 Windows Vista 64 位开始，微软开始要求内核模式驱动程序使用经过验证的证书颁发机构颁发的证书进行数字签名。不过，也有例外情况，使用过期证书或 2015 年 7 月 29 日之前签发的证书签署的驱动程序，也被认为是合法的驱动。已经有多种利用这一漏洞的开源工具出现。思科称，他们观察到多个威胁行为者利用这一政策漏洞部署了数千个恶意签名驱动程序。作为回应，微软阻止了所有这些证书。


消息来源：E-Security Planet



老王点评：为了照顾临时性的特例，而开的一个“后门”，终究会引来更多麻烦。




印度开发商解雇 90% 的技术支持团队，将工作外包给人工智能

一家印度软件开发商初创公司难以负担其客户支持团队的费用，于是将其外包给一个人工智能聊天机器人，后者显然更高效、更便宜。他们反映，改用机器人服务后，首次响应时间从 1 分 44 秒降至 0 秒。解决时间也急剧下降，从人工服务时的 2 小时 13 分钟下降到人工智能服务时的 3 分 12 秒。总体客户支持成本下降了约 85%。


消息来源：The Register



老王点评：尽管印度一直被视为廉价 IT 人才的来源，也是很多公司的全球客户支持中心，但是看起来，人工智能更便宜、更好用。]]></summary>

一些专业的 Linux 用户会使用 screen 或 tmux 命令 来分割多个窗格。这些命令可以在任何终端应用程序中使用，但需要较大的学习曲线。

如果你想要在同一应用窗口中拥有多个终端会话而不涉及 tmux 或 screen 命令 的复杂性，“终结者” 是你的好帮手。



不，我指的不是那个“终结者”。是这个 👇



你的系统上安装的 终端仿真器 可能具有多标签支持。而 Terminator 支持多个可调整大小的终端面板。

它模拟了类似平铺窗口管理器的功能，并将终端面板平铺在单个窗口中。

在本文中，我将向你展示如何在 Ubuntu 和其他 Linux 发行版中安装和使用 Terminator。

但在此之前，让我们快速了解一下 Terminator 提供的功能。

Terminator 可在同一窗口中提供多个终端会话

Terminator 是一个基于 GNOME 终端的 GTK 应用程序，使用了 VTE3（GTK3 虚拟终端仿真器小部件）。

作为一个基于 GNOME 终端的应用程序，它与 GNOME 桌面环境相关联，因此有一些依赖性。

然而，即使有 GNOME 的依赖性，我发现该应用程序相对轻巧。可能在其他桌面环境中使用它不会成为问题。

从外表上看，Terminator 可能与其他终端仿真器相似。但是，Terminator 具有无限可能性，我将在后面的章节中向你展示它们。



功能特点

让我总结一下 Terminator 的一些主要功能：


平铺布局的终端

支持多个标签页

拖拽终端面板（出色的鼠标支持）

类似于平铺窗口管理器的键盘快捷键

可以保存布局和配置文件，以便快速启动

通过插件可扩展功能


安装…]]></summary>

英国格拉斯哥大学政治理论教席荣休教授、荣誉研究员克里斯托弗·贝里（Christopher Berry）是国际著名的苏格兰启蒙运动和亚当·斯密研究专家，现为英国皇家艺术学会会员，苏格兰爱丁堡皇家学会会员，苏格兰学术院院士。他曾出版多部学术著作，其中《苏格兰启蒙运动中的商业社会观念》《苏格兰启蒙运动的社会理论》《奢侈的概念：概念及历史的探究》《大卫·休谟：启蒙与怀疑》等四部已被译为中文。2023年6月，克里斯托弗·贝里应邀参加复旦大学历史系和复旦大学研究生院联合举办的“西方近代思想史”暑期讲习班。正值亚当·斯密诞辰三百周年纪念，我们对贝里教授做了一次专访，由复旦大学历史系李宏图教授协调，复旦大学马克思主义学院副教授、法学博士张晓燕采访。本文为专访的上半部分，贝里教授着重讨论了苏格兰启蒙运动研究的新动向以及对斯密思想的常见误解。

亚当·斯密（1723年6月5日-1790年7月17日)

2023年是亚当·斯密诞辰三百周年，能否向我们介绍一下苏格兰启蒙运动和亚当·斯密研究的最新发展和动向？
克里斯托弗·贝里：过去二十年，或者是更早的一段时间内，斯密研究有很大的改变，这一变化主要是《亚当·斯密著作与书信汇编（格拉斯哥版）》（The Glasgow Edition of the Works and Correspondence of Adam Smith）这套丛书带来的。自此我们拥有了比较完整的斯密著作，这也是读者第一次看到《法理学讲义》（Lectures on Jurisprudence）和《修辞学与文学讲义》（Lectures on Rhetoric and Belles Lettres）等斯密原著，由此也激发了对斯密研究的热情。一批博士生进一步投入到相关主题的研究中，逐渐形成一股学术热潮。斯密研究最初是围绕《国富论》和《道德情操论》展开的，今天能…]]></summary>

本文为克里斯托弗·贝里教授专访的下半部分，他介绍了亚当·斯密和苏格兰启蒙运动对现代社会的影响，以及他所做的有关“奢侈”概念的经典研究。
从方法论的角度，苏格兰启蒙对现代社会科学有什么样的启示？您多次提到苏格兰启蒙受到关注的原因之一就是哈耶克将对自生自发的秩序（spontan eous order）和建构秩序（artificial order）的区分传统归因到苏格兰启蒙。前者关注社会与文化的历史演化，这种方法论被认为源自于苏格兰启蒙，苏格兰启蒙中对习俗而非理性的强调是否可以认为是受自然科学影响的产物？苏格兰启蒙在如何处理好规范与经验、普遍性与多样性的关系问题上，为社会科学方法论提供了什么样的启发？
克里斯托弗·贝里：哈耶克因为所秉持的经济理论以及他对凯恩斯经济理论的反对而闻名，他所属的奥地利经济学派所持的观点在十九世纪末属于比较边缘的学术观点。奥地利学派的观点在一定程度上是斯密主义的体现，但是对斯密围绕对个人利益和公共善的追求的观点做了非常狭窄的解读。奥地利学派认为，与其他人相比，每个人是自我利益的最佳判断者，个体之间相互合作，在此基础上产生需求，产业机构试图满足这种需求，这就是价格机制的运行过程。用哈耶克的话来说，价格就是一个信号，从需求状况中传递生产信息。这是一种对奥地利经济学派的观点毫无修饰的陈述，哈耶克则多次使用了一个弗格森所运用的表达来描述这一观点，这个表达就是自生自发的秩序。自生自发的秩序是一个很古老的观念，指代的是这样一个没有任何直接的人为因素或者说官僚力量的影响，事物自有其发展方式的秩序模式，自生自发的秩序也意味着客观上也没有人可以控制这个发展的过程。很多持哈耶克观点的人对此是毫无保留的，都认为这种自生自发的秩序是最佳的，因为是由个体来决定自己的兴趣和利益是什么。我总是通过一件轶事来跟学生阐述这一理论。我曾经到美国进行过两次讲学…]]></summary>

And, to be honest, I have absolutely no idea what happened, my PC seemingly decided to not recognize the SSD as something it should boot from anymore. My first attempt at fixing this was checking the GPT / MBR and partitions with a Ubuntu live-installation using gdisk, which promptly complained that the EFI partition was not aligned properly. Wondered (still do) how that happened but proceeded to fix it with parted. I also mounted the partitions to check whether some important files were missing or corrupted, but everything was normal. With the GPT being valid, all partitions aligned and working and the boot flags set where needed I though my work was done and blissedly rebooted. Of course it didn't work. I unplugged every other drive that could somehow get in the way in the boot order (my PC is sometimes a bit whacky in regards to that), still not working. Then it occurred to me that maybe GRUB was somehow damaged and it could not load the 2nd or even 1st stage or something like that (I had used grub-install just before it broke down, but neither on the drive nor the partitions in question). Back on the Ubuntu I checked for that but it seems to be fine. As of now I currently contemplate whether it is worth to fiddle around some more or if it'd be better to just re-install and then restore my data.

 I've been using Arch now for about 15 years or so. Throughout the years, there's been a bunch of different ugly situations, with what one would think would be a regular update caused my system to not boot, or get or messed up in some other way that forced a boot from a live USB stick (or something similar).
 I remember that time about a decade ago, when there was some major change to Xorg (some portion related to input devices was separated out from the project), which resulted in people being greeted with an X-server that was grey, desktop manager not loaded, had the base Xorg "X"-pointer in the middle of the screen, and neither keyboard nor mouse worked, therefore not even allowing switc…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[To access the OpenVPN server on your Synology device from outside the mobile operator's network, you need to set up proper port forwarding on the router that is connected to the mobile operator's network. Here are some steps to take:
  
Set up an OpenVPN server on your Synology device using the DSM admin interface. Make sure all necessary settings are configured, such as IP addresses, authentication protocols, and certificates.
 
On the router that is connected to the mobile operator's network, you need to forward the OpenVPN ports to the IP address of your Synology device. The standard OpenVPN port is 1194 (UDP). Check your router's manual for how to set up port forwarding.
 
For mobile carriers, you may also need to set up network address translation (NAT) on your router to redirect traffic from the external network to your Synology device's IP address on your local network. Consult your mobile operator's documentation or support for specific NAT setup instructions.
 
Make sure the OpenVPN server is running on your Synology device.
 
 After completing these steps, you should be able to connect to the OpenVPN server on your Synology device from outside your mobile operator's network using the public IP address or dynamic DNS assigned to your router.
 It is also worth remembering that some mobile operators may block certain ports or protocols, which may make it difficult to access from outside. In this case, contact your mobile operator for more information on restrictions and how to bypass them.

互联网档案馆向 GitHub 发出移除请求，要求移除一个名为 DeGouRou 的工具。这是一个专门用于规避行业标准图书馆 TPM 的工具，可以允许读者保存他们借阅的图书的无 DRM 副本。互联网档案馆和其他图书馆使用这些 TPM 允许读者借阅加密图书，阅读加密图书，并归还加密图书。值得注意的是，互联网档案馆并“没有得到版权所有者的授权”提交这份移除通知。GitHub 满足了它的要求，但随后该软件代码出现在了更多地方。

老王点评：嗯，被出版商们揪着不放的互联网档案馆，抽出手来打击一下盗版工具。




Meta 公司将发布 LLaMA 的商业版本

LLaMA 是 Meta 开源的大型语言模型（LLM），于今年 2 月公开发布，并提供给研究人员和学者使用，它有 70 亿、130 亿、330 亿和 650 亿等不同参数规模。开源的 LLaMA 中并没有包括其所使用的权重数据，但很快这些权重数据被“意外”泄露，并迅速引爆了一系列基于它的开源创新。尽管开源人工智能模型已经存在，但 Meta 的 LLaMA 商业化仍是重要的一步，因为它比市场上现有的许多开源 LLM 都要大，而且它来自全球最大的科技公司之一。

老王点评：先开源培养生态，然后再基于此推出商业版本，这是一步好棋。




GTK 对 macOS 的支持将降到“尽力而为”的状态

GNOME 的开发者们正在考虑是否退役 macOS 上的 GLib 和 GTK 持续集成（CI）构建工具。除了 CI 硬件老化之外，CI 维护者对 macOS 也没有太多经验，而 GTK/GLib 开发者对 macOS 开发也不是特别感兴趣或熟悉。如果没有志愿者站出来处理 macOS 特定的回归问题，macOS CI 生成器可能会被逐步淘汰，反过来 GTK/GLib macOS 支持会降到“尽力而为”的状态，并依靠下游打包者和消费者来测试更改。


消息来源：Phoronix



老王点评：毕竟苹果公司不感兴趣，用户也寥寥无几，开发者自然也没有足够的动力和支持来进行。不过，还是有几个可以在 macOS 上运行的不错的 GNOME 软件的。]]></summary>

Then it came to a black screen and the cursor works I can even right click to bring up the menu but as soon as I move the cursor the menu disappears. I can open a tty terminal but that's it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[《最厉害的家伙》书影

1956年4月，香港三育图书文具公司出版了一部“滑稽讽刺小说”《最厉害的家伙》，原著者丹蒙·伦扬（版权页印作D·伦扬），译者金庸。共收录翻译小说七篇，依次是《吃饭比赛》《柠檬少爷》《记者之妻》《十二枪将》《最厉害的家伙》《超等大脚》和《恋爱大王》（以下称为前七篇）。
一
此七篇小说，根据目前零星资料判断，初刊是在香港《新晚报》，署名是“温华篆”，具体日期不详，大致在1950年10月至1952年6月期间，香港《新晚报》创刊于1950年10月，创刊伊始即连载金庸翻译的《中国震撼着世界》，继后是《朝鲜美军被俘记》《朝鲜血战内幕》，1952年6月5日，翻译完《朝鲜血战内幕》，推测前七篇就出现在这一时间段之内。金庸在完成职业翻译工作任务之余，翻译了这些短篇小说，在《朝鲜血战内幕》连载结束，金庸又接续前文未竟之事，接连翻译出《马场经纪》《神枪大盗》《开夹万专家》（以下称为后三篇），于6月6日开始连载，至7月2日结束，署名也是“温华篆”。但是，前七篇结集《最厉害的家伙》出版，并未包含后三篇。
1966年11月前后，前七篇再刊于香港《明报》，署名“金庸”，由云君配图。
1981年3月1日至4月3日，前七篇再次刊于新加坡《南洋商报》，署名“金庸”，无配图。其后，再未见到出现刊载。
2016年7月，香港天地图书有限公司出版《香港当代作家作品选集·金庸卷》，李以建编，收录了前七篇。
需要注意的是，此书收录的七篇作品，与《最厉害的家伙》在编目排序上有所变化，在文字上也不尽相同，被故作聪明的编辑动了手脚，在引文上敬请读者小心使用。
实际上，金庸翻译丹蒙·伦扬小说，曾经在香港《大公报》上刊登过两篇，比《新晚报》更早。第一篇是《记者之妻》，刊登日期是1948年9月8日至12日，后来被收录到《最厉害的家伙》；第二篇是《会一会总统》，刊登日期是1948年11月23日至28日，此篇命运…]]></summary>

LCTT 译注：昨天，AlmaLinux 称将 放弃 对 RHEL 的 1:1 兼容性，但将保持对 RHEL 的 ABI 兼容，以便在 RHEL 上运行的软件可以无缝地运行在 AlmaLinux 上。可能有的同学对 ABI 的概念还不是很清楚，因此翻译此文供大家了解。


许多 Linux 爱好者都熟悉 Linus Torvalds 的 著名告诫：“我们不破坏用户空间”，但可能并非每个听到这句话的人都清楚其含义。

这个“第一规则”提醒开发人员关于应用程序的二进制接口（ABI）的稳定性，该接口用于应用程序与内核之间的通信和配置。接下来的内容旨在使读者熟悉 ABI 的概念，阐述为什么 ABI 的稳定性很重要，并讨论 Linux 稳定 ABI 中包含了哪些内容。Linux 的持续增长和演进需要对 ABI 进行变更，其中一些变更引起了争议。

什么是 ABI？

ABI 表示 应用程序二进制接口Applications Binary Interface。理解 ABI 概念的一种方式是考虑它与其他概念的区别。对于许多开发人员来说，应用程序编程接口Applications Programming Interface（API）更为熟悉。通常，库的头文件和文档被认为是其 API，以及还有像 HTML5 这样的标准文档。调用库或交换字符串格式数据的程序必须遵守 API 中所描述的约定，否则可能得到意外的结果。

ABI 类似于 API，因为它们规定了命令的解释和二进制数据的交换方式。对于 C 程序，ABI 通常包括函数的返回类型和参数列表、结构体的布局，以及枚举类型的含义、顺序和范围。截至 2022 年，Linux 内核仍然几乎完全是 C 程序，因此必须遵守这些规范。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[在 Bash 基础系列的这一章中，学习如何向 Bash 脚本传递参数并使它们具有交互性。


来让 Bash 脚本有参数吧 😉

你可以通过向 Bash 脚本传递变量来使其更加有用和更具交互性。

让我通过示例详细向你展示这一点。

将参数传递给 Shell 脚本

当你运行 Shell 脚本时，你可以按以下方式向其中添加其他变量：

./my_script.sh var1 var2


在脚本内部，你可以使用 $1 作为第一个参数，$2 作为第二个参数，依此类推。


💡 $0 是一个特殊变量，保存正在执行的脚本的名称。


让我们通过一个实际的例子来看看。切换到保存练习 Bash 脚本的目录。

mkdir -p bash_scripts && cd bash_scripts


现在，创建一个名为 arguments.sh （我想不出更好的名称）的新 Shell 脚本，并向其中添加以下行：

#!/bin/bash

echo "Script name is: $0"
echo "First argument is: $1"
echo "Second argument is: $2"


保存文件并使其可执行。现在像往常一样运行脚本，但这次向其中添加任意两个字符串。你将看到屏幕上打印的详细信息。


🚧 参数由空格（空格、制表符）分隔。如果参数中有空格，请使用（英文）双引号将其引起来，否则它将被视为单独的参数。





💡 Bash 脚本最多支持 255 个参数。但对于参数 10 及以上，你必须使用花括号 ${10}、${11}...${n}。


正如你所看到的，$0 代表脚本名称，而其余参数存储在编号变量中。你还可以在脚本中使用一些其他特殊变量。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi so I am a computer science student who is interested in the field of system administration and cloud computing and obviously know linux is among the most important skills in theses fields i have previously worked with windows server but am a complete beginner on linux but I recently started to learn and was told that ubuntu and fedora where the best option for system administration but hear is the thing I don't really like the feel of ubuntu and it has crashed on me a couple of times while I actually like fedora i found that there where a lot of software i could not install as a lot of software was designed for debian not redhat case in point Cisco packet tracer which I use to study networking 
 Now I tried linux mint and really enjoyed using it but I was told that it is more for personal use not professional and a lot of server and system administration task can't be done on it and also that it's not really a safe os as it's been hacked be for 
 But since I enjoyed using linux mint I wanted to know if I could use it for system administration or if it even safe to use

I just realized that I have important docs that could’ve been shared with the world if someone happened to find the server from my laptop. Am I being paranoid or is it possible for hackers to constantly check open servers by pinging every combination of ports and download contents from open ones? i know it was dumb but i didn’t really think about it at the time

The problem I have is, this PC does not have any form of graphic output. No output on the mobo, and no GPU. I have no spare GPU or ability to acquire one either. Just my laptop for network access. Is there any way to install the TrueNAS os remotely? What are my options here, without spending any money?
 I've been searching the web for possible options for a few months now, and come up with almost nothing, except removing the hard drive and installing it, then hoping that the drivers are right when I reinstall the SSD for the PC to boot up.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I initially wrote this simple TUI file manager a few months ago. I struggled with a few things such as scrolling files off screen, hovering them properly, resetting cursor position, etc. I've since learned more and implemented all my knowledge. This time around I made a push and pop implementation for bash, in bash, which made writing this file manager much easier. I wrote this to increase my productivity on the commandline; This allows me to navigates files much quicker and edit them without any trouble, no more worrying about copy/pasting names, remembering them or using wildcards to make up the difference. Instead of ls, cd, EDITOR, pwd, etc - They are handled by simply using the arrow keys or H, J, K, L respectively
 This is a compelete rewrite focused on stability, simplicity and design before continuing on to features. Majority of the fearures mentioned in the README.md are not implemented yet (adding more features is not hard). Anyway, I'm curious what everyone thinks about it; If you'd use it, what could change, etc. Any testers, contributions or feedback is really, much appreciated!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[You might have heard the news that China has released a homegrown Linux distro dubbed OpenKylin. I know very well that stuff made-in-China (especially those labeled "independently created") can be pretty sloppy in implementation details. So consider this post "how not to properly configure a Linux system". Here we go:
  
The ISO archive doesn't have checksums. MD5 values are available at the official website
 Some common CLI utilities (less, man) are not installed by default.
 I've received two system upgrades since fresh install. Both upgrades are tagged w/ version 602.0001 and share the same patch notes. The version number cannot be found in dpkg -l. There must be another package management mechanism running. 
 ...and it's definitely not Flatpak. Although Flatpak is preinstalled, no remotes (not even flathub) are preconfigured
 
 APT is configured w/ APT::Get::AllowUnauthenticated=true, effectively bypasses package signing. 
 Combining the fact that the default APT repository is accessed via plain-text HTTP, this is wide open to man-in-the-middle attacks.
 
 Docker is preinstalled and enabled. The Docker bridge network is configured as "bip": "128.128.0.1/16". You can't access this part of the Internet anymore.
 (Important) packages can be outdated. ca-certificates is at version 20190110 which is four years old.
 /etc/localtime is a symlink to /usr/share/zoneinfo/Asia/Shanghai but the content of /etc/timezone is Etc/UTC.
 Proprietary packages (e.g. nvidia-driver-510) can be installed via apt without editing the default sources.list. I guess they don't have to worry about legal issues.
 Like Ubuntu, systemd-resolved is the default DNS service. But theres' also a dnsmasq service enabled, listening to 127.0.0.1:53 with the default upstream set to 114.114.114.114 (provided by www.114dns.com) 
 Though systemd-resolved is running with stock config file. No custom upstream configured.
 
  
Feel free to ask me for stuff that you are curious about.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[AlmaLinux 不再追求与 RHEL 的 1:1 兼容性

随着红帽对 RHEL 源代码库的限制访问，虽然 Rocky Linux 已经表示 找到 了继续发布 1:1 克隆品的解决方案，但 AlmaLinux “决定放弃与 RHEL 1:1（兼容）的目标”。退而求其次，AlmaLinux 将在可能的范围内与 RHEL 保持一致并兼容应用二进制接口（ABI），这样在 RHEL 上运行的软件也可以在 AlmaLinux 上运行。对于典型的用户，这将意味着你在使用 AlmaLinux 时几乎不会有什么变化。最大的变化是，AlmaLinux 将不再与红帽保持 “问题级的兼容性”，现在可以接受红帽发布周期之外的问题修复。虽然这意味着一些 AlmaLinux 的用户可能会遇到 RHEL 中没有的问题，但 AlmaLinux 也可能会接受尚未被 RHEL 接受的补丁。


消息来源：Almalinux



老王点评：这就是红帽的目的吧？最终这些精确克隆品的结果可能都这样吧。但是我很怀疑红帽以后还会给建立 ABI 兼容也制造“没必要提供的”麻烦。




好莱坞想要永远免费得到龙套演员的人工智能复制品

好莱坞的演员们将要举行一场罢工，主要的原因是好莱坞电影公司的一项以“保护演员的数字肖像权”为名义的人工智能提案。在该提案中，那些经常出现在背景中的龙套演员会被一次性扫描，而电影公司将拥有他们的扫描件、形象、肖像，并且能在他们想要的任何项目中永远使用，无需同意，无需补偿。使用生成式人工智能一直是双方谈判的主要症结之一。组织罢工的演员工会表示，“如果我们现在不站得高一点，我们都会有麻烦，我们都会面临被机器取代的危险。”


消息来源：The Verge



老王点评：别说是龙套，就是主角和配角，将来都会全是 AI 制品，早晚而已。




2027 年欧盟销售的智能手机电池需要可更换

6 月中旬，欧洲议会投票通过新立法，要求智能手机等消费设备的电池必须易于拆卸和更换。本周，欧洲理事会正式同意了这项新法规。任何想要在欧盟销售手机的制造商必须确保这些手机在 2027 年之前拥有可更换电池。


消息来源：Android Authority



老王点评：自从智能手机开始流行，不知道为什么大家就接受了电池不可更换的做法。现在，欧洲带了一个好头。

 Deja-Dup allows you to choose which folders to back up.
 Except I'm not exactly sure which ones to back up for a system restore. Ofc I could tell it to back up almost all of them but I was hoping to be more discriminating.
 This is what Thunar (the file manager) displays in the / directory.

 I only know that I won't be backing up media and mnt (these are for mounting other hard drive partitions and USB devices) and home (application data, user mode configs and documents which I'm not trying to backup).
 What is the purpose of the other directories and which other ones could I exclude from the back up for the purpose of a system restore?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[使用这些步骤来为你的第一个或接下来的项目打下坚实的基础。


开源 是一个蓬勃发展且有益的生态系统，它通过分散模式和社区贡献开发的软件，公开解决社区和行业问题。

随着这个生态系统的爆炸式发展，许多开发者想要参与并且构建新的开源项目。问题是：如何成功实现这一目标呢？

这篇文章将会揭秘开源项目的生命周期与结构。给你一个对开源项目内部运作的概述，并根据我个人的经验，向你展示如何构建一个成功和可持续发展的项目。

对开源的简单概述

开源促进会Open Source Initiative（OSI）提供了对“开源Open Source”的正式、详细的定义，但是维基百科提供了一个很好的总结：


开源软件是指根据许可证发布的计算机软件，版权持有人授予用户使用、研究、更改和向任何人、为了任何目的分发软件和它的源代码的权利。


开源软件通常在网络上有公开的代码，它由多人合作或一人开发。这就需要与来自不同地区、不同文化和不同技术背景的人合作，而且往往是远程合作。

开源项目的构成

就像人类的身体，一个开源项目由多个结构组成，这些结构构成了整个系统。我认为它们是两个分支：人员（微观）和文档（宏观）。

分支一：人员

通常，一个开源项目包括以下人群：


创建者：创建项目的人

维护者：积极管理整个项目的人

贡献者：为项目做贡献的人（像你一样的人！）

用户：使用这个项目的人，包括开发者和非技术客户

工作组：将贡献者分成特定领域的小组，专注于围绕特定主题领域（如文档、指引、测试、DevOps、代码审查、性能、研究等）的集合。

赞助人：为项目提供资金支持的人


当你准备构建一个新项目时，你需要考虑以上列表中的每一个群组。你对他们每个人有什么计划？


对于维护者，请确定任用维护者的标准。通常，积极的贡献者就是最适合的维护者。

在 定制 Linux 桌面 时，我们经常忽视光标主题。一个经过深思熟虑选择的光标主题可以提升你的 Linux 桌面，增添个性化的风格并提升整体美感。从简约而精致的设计到奇妙而有趣的动画，这里是十个适合每个人的最佳光标主题。

如何在 Linux 桌面下载和安装光标主题

对于下面列出的所有主题，在相应页面上找到下载链接。下载压缩文件并解压缩。然后，将顶层的主题文件夹复制到 Linux 发行版中的 ~/.icons 或 /usr/share/icons 目录中。然后按照下面的步骤进行相应桌面的设置。

Xfce

从应用菜单中选择 “设置Settings > 设置管理Settings manager > 鼠标和触摸板Mouse and Touchpad”。然后转到 “主题Themes” 选项卡并选择相应的光标主题。你还可以选择光标大小。



KDE Plasma

从 KDE 应用菜单打开 “系统设置System Settings”。然后选择 “工作空间主题Workspace theme > 光标Cursors”。选择主题并点击 “应用Apply”。



GNOME

对于 GNOME 桌面，请安装 GNOME “调整Tweaks” 工具。你可以在基于 Debian 的系统上使用以下命令进行安装。

sudo apt install gnome-tweak-tool


安装后，你可以打开 GNOME 调整工具并选择 “外观Appearance”。然后从下拉菜单中选择光标。



Linux 的最佳光标主题

Bibata

Bibata 是一套备受赞誉的光标主题，已成为寻求个性化体验的用户的最爱。这个主题因其独特的圆角外观和各种颜色选项而最近变得流行起来。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[1950年代初梁萍在电台献唱（关有有供图）

梁萍是时代曲歌星里的奇女子。她于1941年考取上海的英商百代公司，成为签约歌手，挤入歌坛的上层社会。此前，她并没有舞厅驻唱、电台献艺的经验，换言之，她以新人姿态一飞冲天，无视由白虹、周璇等前辈创下，吴莺音、逸敏等同侪守卫的歌星养成计划，而在那个游戏规则里，歌手在灌录唱片之前免不了要背靠舞厅或者电台，吃一段时间的大锅饭。先不谈梁萍的天赋，如此反例的形成其实与她的家境优越有一些关系。这便构成了梁萍的第二点奇特之处。同仁唱歌主要是讨生活，行话叫鬻歌，梁萍没有经济压力，她唱歌是满足爱好，就像现在的年轻人欢喜唱K，主要是为了自我娱乐。
在旧上海，梁萍唱了八年，出过近二十张唱片，名下歌曲超过三十首，有热门佳作，缺传世金曲。这个成绩在行业里属于二等撞线，与头等舱还有很长的距离。但是在回望的舞台，有一束特别的光照亮了梁萍，源于她为旧上海的时代曲历史留下的女性创作之身影。熟悉时代曲的都清楚，女性在这个领域牢牢把持着话筒，而男性则是词曲创作的执笔者，前者称霸台前，后者垄断幕后。梁萍在二战之后的上海写过五首歌，自己演唱，百代发片，成为那个年代极为罕见的唱作人（Singer-Songwriter），在她之前，这样的全才还有严华、姚敏，皆为男性。

1926年11月14日，梁萍生于上海。我能够给出这条独家讯息，得益于梁萍的外孙关有有（Johnny Quan）。三年前，他在美国某社交平台发了一个帖子，题为“My Grandma Didn't Let Me See Her Photo Album Before She Passed, And Only Now Did I Find Out About Her Illustrious Life”。此帖迅速成为爆款，国内的自媒体编译推文《外婆去世后，美国小伙整理生前相册，发现她竟是老上海歌星》，刷屏朋友圈。那大…]]></summary>

I have used Linux for years but have not played with many distros in awhile and have realized I am a bit behind on what some things support. I was wondering if anyone could recommend something that has these features. 
 1 - Wayland Support
 2 - Rolling Updates/Releases
 3 - KDE Support(I can normally add this myself)
 4 - DNF or APT (ANYTHING but pacman. I hate pacman) 
 I have considered Rocky Linux or Fedora. But I am not sure how good the Wayland support in either of those are right now. I am currently running this. I am wanting to setup a highly customized system that I can compile the Kernel for myself. I used Gentoo for a bit but I occasionally need to use programs for work that are on Linux but dont have all open source binaries and I am then limited to RPM/DEB packages.. Having to compile everything from source or be forced to use snap / flatpaks is a no go for me.. If I could use DEB or RPM packages I would stick with Gentoo. Also please excuse my ugly KDE ui. I just switched from Gnome to KDE and I am still customizing it.

the distribution will no longer be a strict clone of Red Hat Enterprise
Linux, but will maintain ABI compatibility.


	For a typical user, this will mean very little change in your use
	of AlmaLinux. Red Hat-compatible applications will still be able to
	run on AlmaLinux OS, and your installs of AlmaLinux will continue
	to receive timely security updates. The most remarkable potential
	impact of the change is that we will no longer be held to the line
	of “bug-for-bug compatibility” with Red Hat, and that means that we
	can now accept bug fixes outside of Red Hat’s release cycle. While
	that means some AlmaLinux OS users may encounter bugs that are not
	in Red Hat, we may also accept patches for bugs that have not yet
	been accepted upstream, or shipped downstream.]]></summary>

 Right now I am using proton calender on android phone and macOS calender, but it have its own set of problems.
 I need a calender app that have native software for, Linux, android... And also the rest if possible. Of course it should sync between them and also make entries when offline (proton does not do this, online only)
 Does something like this exist ?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This is something that I’ve recently have thought about as I’m getting ready to graduate in a few months with an engineering degree, and looking back at my time of switching to Linux full time. Outside of certain software that did require windows, I have, for the most part, successfully did everything that I’ve needed to with Linux, including using LTSpice and Matlab. Speaking with other engineering students, as the topic of windows beginning to become a subscription was being discussed, why not look into using Linux instead, and they responded as it was unnecessary, and they felt it’s too much. 
 What I am wondering, is whether having experience with Linux is inevitably beneficial, outside of any CS/E degrees, and whether it makes a difference in the end for non CS/E engineers?
 Edit: thank you for who have responded, I am referring to any engineering field outside of Computer Science/Computer Engineering

 I'm starting a CompSci/Cybersecurity master's soon. One of the things I've not really been exposed to is the actual nitty-gritty of Linux Kernel operation.
 Are there any agreed upon "Best" resources for learning things at an engineering level? I'm really interested in getting as close to an expert as I can. A physical book is preferred but a video course works too.
 Thanks in advance.

 Create what is basically an upgrade assistant to move people from Windows to Linux. Make it very simple to use. It will copy over files automatically (or from a backup which can be prompted for or created in the program) to the appropriate areas in Linux. It will auto install all of the programs the user needs with the Linux equivalents (or that the user selects, should they decide they don't need all the programs they've installed in Windows). Then they select a distro, with brief details as to what each distro is like. As a bonus, perhaps also have a prompt for familiar…]]></summary>

 ​
 I run a small YouTube channel and for my sake and for content, looking at making an ultimate comparison to test which would be the best hosting provider.
 ​
 Currently plan to test all under a lot of the domains that I have based on speed, uptime, support, price etc and ofcourse have a category for each such as best for price, best for overall, best for so and so etc.
 ​
 To help form my plan, was wondering - what all stuff would you guys look for when someone runs a test like this? What all things would you want included, done, performed, tested or even analysed for you to know that this would be a test which is most cohesive, fair and thorough because that would be the goal for the test.
 ​
 Thanks all!

 But I don't understand the reasoning behind the bug-for-bug clones of RHEL like Rocky and Alma (and previously CentOS), where they just change the branding without adding anything to set them apart. Is it simply to provide people and businesses with a version of RHEL they don't have to pay for support?

 Which app is best for it, or maybe it would be better to write a bash script for it?
 I want a simple solution configuration, like Grafana plus Prometheus, which is too complicated for me at the moment.

三家覆盖中国智能手机行业的第三方技术研究公司告诉路透社，华为应该能够利用自身在半导体设计工具方面的进步，以及中芯国际的芯片制造，在中国国内采购 5G 芯片。关于半导体设计工具，我们几个月前在 #951 报道过，华为称已开发出自己的 14 纳米芯片设计套件。华为曾一度与苹果和三星争夺全球最大手机制造商的地位，直到 2019 年开始的一轮美国限制措施，切断了其获得生产最先进机型所必需的芯片制造工具的渠道。

谷歌应用商店将允许在应用和游戏中使用 NFT

谷歌今天宣布了一项重大的政策调整，允许开发者将 NFT 等数字资产纳入其商店中的应用和游戏。谷歌称，这将允许合作伙伴重新想象 “用户拥有内容的传统游戏”，并 “通过独特的 NFT 奖励提高用户忠诚度”。决定提供购买、出售或赚取代币化资产能力的公司将被要求明确说明应用程序中存在基于区块链的元素。

迪士尼和 Netflix 等反对 FTC 简化取消订阅流程的提议

如今各种服务都在努力吸引用户订阅，但如果你想终止某个服务的订阅就不是那么容易了。美国联邦贸易委员会（FTC）宣布了被称为 “点击取消” 的提议，要求企业让取消服务和订阅一样简单。企业不能够让用户在网上订阅服务，但取消的操作却要通过电话来完成。也不能对于服务设定不取消就默认续订，而是企业需要每年提醒用户。包括迪士尼、派拉蒙、华纳兄弟、Netflix、索尼、环球影业等公司在内的行业组织对 FTC 的提议提出反对意见，认为拟议的法规过于模糊，会导致营销人员过度披露信息。它们甚至认为该提议会违反美国宪法第一修正案，侵犯其成员的“言论自由权”。


消息来源：Business Insider



老王点评：这种上船容易下船难的做法，早就该管管了。为啥我就一直不喜欢订阅服务——虽然我最近增加了不少订阅服务，我甚至觉得有必要用个应用来专门管理订阅服务。]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A year ago today, I wrote a journal entry making plans to end everything. It wasn't the first such entry, either. I was deeply addicted to gaming, sinking lower and lower, year by year. I was a complete loser, life was challenging and depressing, and I couldn't feel any joy.
 Then, in one computer science lecture, the professor was talking about Linux, and mentioned, “Linux is an important OS for computer science. But I don't think any of you should install it, because it will break your computer, unless you know what you're doing.”
 I had heard of Linux, but used to dismiss it as a niche OS. Curiosity got the better of me, and I decided to try it out anyway, my first distro being Ubuntu. I was amazed how well it ran compared to Windows. I was also learning new stuff and customizing things left and right.
 Even more amazingly, I felt joy for the first time in a long time. Real joy.
 However, I didn't know what I was doing, and broke my computer just as the professor foretold. I had to reinstall Ubuntu many times. During one of these reinstall, I accidentally wiped the entire disk, including the Windows installation I was dual-booting to play my games.
 The enjoyment I got from using and customizing Linux, combined with a laziness to install Windows, was exactly what I needed to eventually get rid of my gaming addiction. It had a hold over me for over a decade, and I was finally free. Linux also led the way to me rediscovering some of my older hobbies, as well as restoring my enjoyment of coding.
 Now, one year from that journal entry, life is still incredibly difficult and overwhelming at times, but I have regained hope. And I find joy in my activities, not the least of which is simply using my computer running Linux. Linux saved my life and turned it around. I am eternally grateful.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi,
 Has anyone ever used logical volume manager (LVM) to create snapshots and restore for Redhat Linux patching purposes before? Is it easy or reliable to use? What are the things to look out for or are there better alternatives?
 Possibly using them in a HA environment with pacemaker and corosync.
 Thanks!

生日是特殊的日子，从亲朋好友那里收到生日祝福是非常令人满足和愉悦的。

作为 Linux 用户，你可以通过终端给朋友和家人带来一些酷炫的生日祝福。

这是我为 Abhishek 先生的生日制作的生日卡片（或者说动画）。



我们团队的每个人都非常喜欢它，所以我受到请求要按照它做一个教程。我很乐意满足请求，因为这可能对我们的读者有所帮助 😃


✋ 这个教程需要在终端中编辑配置文件。熟练使用 Linux 终端和命令会更容易理解和跟随本教程。


安装 PyBirthdayWish

PyBirthdayWish 是一个小型的 Python 程序，通过它你可以创建漂亮的终端生日祝福，还可以播放音乐！

这个程序本身在 Ubuntu 的默认软件仓库中不可用，你需要使用 Pip 进行安装。


PyBirthdayWish GitHub


首先，使用以下命令在 Ubuntu 中 安装 Pip：

sudo apt install python3-pip


安装完 Pip 后，你可以克隆该存储库并安装该程序：

git clone https://github.com/hemantapkh/PyBirthdayWish.git && cd PyBirthdayWish && pip install -r requirements.txt


在他们的存储库中，你可以查看 .requirements.txt 文件，了解上述命令中所需的依赖项。

安装完成后，在你克隆的 PyBirthdayWish 目录中运行以下命令：

python3 PyBirthdayWish.py


这将要求你按下 F11 键，然后按回车键进入全屏模式，然后播放…]]></summary>

 However, whenever I use a good quality hi-def monitor on my macbook air (or at the office) I feel like the need to upgrade my home monitors. However, having looked into it, I'm not sure how to progress, because it looks/sounds like a mess with wayland vs x11.
 My eyes are not what they used to be, so I can't go to a tiny font, but it seems like my macbook is spot on.
 Is there a way for me to reach similar levels of resolution/quality on linux? I'm happy to spend whatever on a good monitor (32" or 34" if need be)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[你终于可以升级 Zorin OS 版本而无需重新安装。虽迟但到。




Zorin OS 无疑是 最美丽的 Linux 发行版 之一。它基于 Ubuntu LTS，以全面的软件包为用户提供类似（但不限于） Windows 的体验。

然而，它缺乏无缝升级方式。

在最近的一份公告中，Zorin OS 背后的人们终于推出了一个新的更新程序来处理该操作系统的所有升级工作！ 🤩

考虑为什么它是初学者的不错选择之一的另一个原因是什么？ 我想是这样...


Zorin OS 是初学者理想选择的 5 个原因


因此，事不宜迟，让我们简单地看一下。

Zorin OS 更新程序：初步印象 ⭐



Zorin OS 更新程序的到来是理所当然的，因为多年来开发人员收到了来自用户的许多请求，希望能有这样一个的一站式解决方案。

以前，想要切换到较新版本或更改变体的用户必须完全重新安装 Zorin OS，并且必须从头开始设置系统。

现在，不用了！

Zorin OS 更新程序是一个简洁的解决方案，允许用户轻松执行主要版本或变体升级，而无需全新安装 Zorin OS。

例如： 假设你使用的是 Zorin OS 15 Core。你可以使用此应用升级到 Zorin OS 16 Core 甚至 Zorin OS 16 Pro。

好了，继续。

让我们看看更新程序及其工作原理。我们还在本文的底部向你展示了如何使用它。

当你启动该应用时，你将看到一个页面，其中包含 Zorin OS 安装的当前版本/变体以及可用升级的列表。



当你继续操作时，你可以选择包含所有附加功能的正常安装，也可以选择包含核心程序的最小安装。



如果你要升级到 Zorin OS Pro，你必须输入你的电子邮件地址和支持代码才能继续升级。



之后，你将看到开始升级的最终提示页面。

他们建议你提前备份数据。如果在升级过程中出现问题，你可以回退。



升级过程开始时，会显示一个进度页面，其中所有重要的升级阶段都会高亮显示。



一切设置完毕后，你可以重启系统以完成操作系统升级过程。



📖 如何访问 Zorin OS 更新程序

你所需要做的就是更新你的系统以安装新的 Zorin OS 升级工具。

但是，它目前处于 Beta 测试，尚未作为稳定的工具提供。你可以在接下来的几周内期待它。


ℹ️ 通过 Zorin 菜单 → 系统工具System Tools → 软件更新程序Software Updater 更新你的系统


你可以尝试手动安装测试版，但需要自行承担风险。

打开终端并输入以下命令：

sudo apt update
sudo apt install zorin-os-upgrader


然后，要开始升级过程，请启动“升级 Zorin OSUpgrade Zorin OS”应用，然后按照屏幕上的说明进行操作。

对于 Zorin OS 15 的用户： 如果你在首次启动升级应用时没有看到任何升级选项，那么需要在终端中运行以下命令：

gsettings set com.zorin.desktop.upgrader show-test-upgrades true


你可以阅读 官方帮助指南 以获取更多信息。

But to use Linux I'm buying a framework laptop to try out nix os I've tried all kinds of distro and that one seems good as a developer machine. I really wanted to ditch windows but I can't due to that and work requiring me to use windows but my enjoyment will be to have Linux on my laptop. I enjoy Linux more then I enioy windows. And don't worry Linux fans I will use Linux on my laptop a ton actually. I love tinkering with my PCs and using the terminal for everything. I have withdrawals when Im on windows and not using Linux which is a big thing lol. If I could be a full stack engineer with Linux I would and I already use pretty much all open source software as well as gaming is way better due to me using Mesa drivers on my amd Gpu. But unfortunately I have to use windows if anyone can convince me to switch for my main rig and give me info on why I should do that I will gladly switch back to Linux and ditch windows entirely.

 I have tried to do RHCSA but without success, now i have several question:
 - Can I do everything as root or should I use another user? In my test it was not specified and I did everything as root
 - What does redhat mean by "Essential tools" ?
 - I was prompted to create a vg with an extent of 20, but even though I did "
 vgcreate [vg_name] [PV] -s 20 
 " it was counted as incorrect, I specify that it was not specified on which PV to have to create the logical volume
 Do you guys have any other advice for me?

英国著名古典学者玛丽·比尔德（Mary Beard）的《古典学还有未来吗？：从古希腊罗马到现在》（原书名Confronting the Classics: Traditions, Adventures, and Innovations，2013）原书名直译是“直面古典学：传统、冒险与创新”，中译本的书名来自作者于2011年11月30日（比尔德在本书“序言”中写为12月，或误记）在纽约公共图书馆发表的罗伯特-B.西尔维斯演讲，题目就是“古典学还有未来吗？”（Do the Classics Have a Future?），该演讲稿收入本书作为“导论”，比尔德说“‘古典学还有未来吗？’这个标题直击要害。如果你愿意，这就是我的宣言。“（序言，iii）可见中译本以这个题目作为书名对国内读者来说当然是合适的。
玛丽·比尔德自述在三十多年来每年都会为各种期刊撰写几十篇古典学领域著作的书评，这种学术阅读与写作的勤奋很令我感到惊讶。她认为发表书评的重要性不比教学或写论文差，举出的一个例子是她在剑桥古典学系最有影响力的前辈学者摩西·芬利（Moses Finley，1912-1986）在二十世纪五十年代后期和整个六十年代，发表于书评和电台谈话节目中的内容比学术期刊中多得多。本书收入过去二十多年比尔德发表于《伦敦书评》（London Review of Books）、《纽约书评》（New York Review of Books ） 或《泰晤士报文学增刊》（Times Literary Supplement） 上的古典学书评与随笔，并经过恰当的修改和增补。从全书五个部分的引言来看，作者显然是围绕某个主题或问题意识来选择文章并加以修改、增补，加上在行文中均以…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[本文将收于《我的二十世纪：李欧梵回忆录》，香港中文大学出版社即出。

前言：世纪末呓语
我生于1939年，在二十世纪活了六十年，到了“耳顺”的年纪，二十一世纪降临了，我反而感觉天命已逝，不知所措。我不知道自己还能活多久，即使活到一百岁，也不过在二十一世纪活了四十年，而在二十世纪却活了六十年，所以我算是一个二十世纪的人。

大学时期，十九岁。

当然，世纪的意义不能用时间的长短来衡量，对我而言，时间的观念是主观的，甚至是凭自己的感觉。二十世纪对我的意义重大，因为我在二十世纪经历了大大小小的创伤，到了六十岁以后，才感到一切平静了下来，可以和我妻子李子玉快快活活在香港“过平常日子”（编者注：见李欧梵、李玉莹：《过平常日子》修订版，香港三联书店，2018年）。似乎2000年把我的一生分成了两段：前一段是生命体验，后一段是生活、回忆和反思。我的学术生涯似乎也分成两段，前一段在美国，后一段在香港；在美国用英文教学和写作，在香港用中英双语教学，但写作以中文居多。我的英文学术著作只有三四本书，加上数十篇论文，大多以中国现代文学为领域，尚可以连成一气；中文写的以杂文居多，收集成书，竟有二十多本。双语写作，成了习惯，甚至在写作时，不论是用中文或英文，下意识之间都在用两种语言。在美国学界我只有一个身份：学者，然而在香港则刻意当“两栖动物”，游走于学院内外多年，最后还是回归学府，直到2020年才从香港中文大学正式退休，这是继2004年从哈佛提早退休之后的第二次，所以我也有两条学术生命。从来没有料到在香港中文大学任教竟然长达十六年，比在美国任何一间大学任教的时间——例如哈佛十年、芝加哥八年——都长。我这一生似乎都是“一分为二”，没有统一的可能，甚至我的生命旅程也被二十世纪和二十一世纪分开，虽然现在已在二十一世纪活了二十年，但依然觉得自己还是一个二十世纪的人。写这一本回忆录，当然免不了从二十一世纪来回…]]></summary>

kernel-testing framework has come up at several earlier summits, including 
in two separate sessions at last year's event.
Testing kernel filesystems and the block layer, not to mention lots of
other kernel subsystems, has become increasingly
important over time.
  So it was no
surprise that Luis Chamberlain led a 
combined storage and filesystem session at the
2023 Linux Storage, Filesystem,
Memory-Management and BPF Summit to talk more about testing, the
resources needed for it, and what can be done to improve it.  It was the
final session for this year's summit, so this article completes our coverage.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Over on the Open Source Initiative (OSI) blog, the organization has announced the Open Policy Alliance (OPA), which is meant to bring together various non-profit organizations to help educate and inform US policy makers about open-source software and its needs:

The need to create such a program is more urgent today due to the rise of new regulations in the software industry and adjacent open domains around the world. Cyber security, the societal impact of AI, data and privacy are important issues for legislators globally. At the same time, the COVID-19 pandemic drove collaborative development to unprecedented levels and took Open Source software, open research, open content and data from mainstream to main stage. Moving forward, developing these important public policies whilst not harming the ecosystem requires an understanding of how the Open Source ecosystem works. Ensuring stakeholders without historic benefit of representation are included in those discussions becomes paramount to that end.

The OPA will focus on educating public policy makers on Open Source to inform their development and deliberation of new policy concepts. There are unintended consequences that come from a lack of understanding of how open collaboration works in practice. The OPA will address this as well as the historic absence of contribution from underrepresented groups. The interest areas of the OPA community will complement those of Digitable Public Goods Alliance, a UNICEF multi-stakeholder initiative with a mission to accelerate the attainment of sustainable development goals in low- and middle-income countries that OSI joined earlier this year.]]></summary>

 I've been daily driving Linux for about 9 months, using Linux Mint, while also keeping my Window's partition around for the occasions that I need it. I've been test driving several other distros lately on a third partition. I've run into one problem with trying to install Pop_OS! in that it requires a 1Gb EFI partition in order to install. I managed to just make a second EFI partition, get it installed, and could boot into it just fine by selecting it from my boot options at start up. Mint and Windows were still also able to be booted into, no issues.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've had quite the long think about what RHEL has been doing to the open source projects a great many of us know and love (first CentOS, now Alma, Rocky, etc.) and I think the problem is summed up like this: "Line goes up"
 If a publicly traded company is behind an open source project, that open source project is at risk because, line must go up. They will make up any excuse why the line is not going up and make terrible decisions to hopefully make the line go up.
 I've been a CentOS user for years and now a rocky linux user, but I think it's time to leave that flavor behind entirely. So with that in mind I was looking at other options, Ubuntu being one of them because of the option for enterprise support, but there it is again "Line goes up".
 This is why I intend to switch to Debian 12, the latest long term supported version of Debian. Debian is bona fide community run open source project with no profit margins, shareholders, executives, etc. Therefore for Debian there is no line that must go up.
 I implore you as Linux lovers and enjoyers to switch to a distribution in no way tied to a company or gets source from a company and return to the community backed projects that made Linux what it is today.
 Edit: it's surprising to me people still don't know what the issue is. Here is a brief article to explain better than I can: https://www.techhut.tv/rhel-source-code-opensuse-songs/

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[One often stated premise as to why the GPLv2 and certain licenses deemed incompatible by the community is: dynamic linking obviously creates a derived work.
 See for instance the Software Freedom Conservancy's view:
  
The FSF, stewards of the GPL, have stated many times over the past decades that they believe there is no legal distinction between dynamic and static linking of a C program and we agree.
  
But is there any solid reason to believe this is the case? Any case law? Any reasoning from similar facts?
 Because my admittedly shallow view is -- I'm just not sure a copyright license has this kind of power.
 Imagine an extreme case, you build some software which links to MegaEvil Corp's libc, which license specifically states, if you dynamically link to this libc, your work is a derived work of MegaCorp libc, and you forfeit all claims of copyright of your work to MegaEvil Corp. My guess is many courts would say building any such software at an API boundary would be fair use, and copyright law simply does not grant any court the power to enforce this copyright term.
 Why might I guess this is the case? Because courts have actually taken similar positions several times re: software fair use. See, Sega Enterprises Ltd. v. Accolade, Inc., 977 F.2d 1510 (9th Cir. 1992), and Lewis Galoob Toys, Inc. v. Nintendo of America, Inc., 780 F. Supp. 1283 (N.D. Cal. 1991).
 But much worse than the SFC and FSF simply being incorrect is, I worry they either 1) don't know any better or are 2) purposefully misleading users about what the GPL says, and how copyright law works. By encouraging a cramped reading of the GPL and ignoring copyright fair use, they are actually making it harder to build software which interoperates with other software (see ZFS and Linux), and, while the FSF seemed to take Google's side in the Oracle v. Google case, their reasoning re: dynamic linking puts them squarely within Oracle's intellectual camp with respect to copyright fair use.

The gui will configure the daemon process then will be only used when user wants to view the status information or reconfigure. Gui will not be opened by the user for days or months. So I think the ram and performance concerns of electron should not be a very big factor.
 The daemon will be optimized to use as small amount of ram as possible.

 I am starting a new job and I have to choose between a MacBook and a Surface Laptop 4, and I really want to keep using Linux but I don't want to get stuck with Windows if I choose the Surface instead of the MacBook.
 I know about https://github.com/linux-surface/linux-surface but I'm looking for practical feedback from people who did the operation in order to orient my choice.
 People already suggested that I should use WSL to avoid breaking anything, but last time I touched a Windows computer professionally was more than 6 years ago, so I would have to relearn everything, and not having a tiles manager will drive me nuts quickly.
 A MacBook will be better than nothing, but I rather use Linux if possible.
 Thanks all!

 So…
 My dad has given me a Minix NEO N42C-4. It looks like he’s put a 500GB SSD in there and also increased the RAM.(not sure exactly on the RAM because he can’t remember). 
 What I would like to do with this Mini PC is run windows 10 on the internal hard drive, just like it would have done out of the box. Then I would like to put Botacera on the SSD so I can run it as a retro games console when I want to. 
 My problem is that it seems my Dad has put the Windows 10 OS onto the SSD so I need help getting windows 10 back onto the internal hard drive and wiping the SSD so I can start afresh. 
 One of the things I tried was to just remove the SSD in the hope that when I booted it up, the Minix would go into some kind of recovery mode and reload the windows OS but that didn’t work. 
 Any help at all would be greatly appreciated.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Solus 4.4 有了一些令人印象深刻的升级，不久以后将推出一款新版本。




Solus 是一个许久没有出现在新闻中的名字，我们上一次听说它是今年 4 月份它经历了 又一次动荡。

幸运的是，新的组织重组似乎奏效了，因为现在我们在近两年后迎来了新发布！

Solus 是最棒的 独立 Linux 发行版 之一，提供了非常适合初学者的用户体验。

和它的上一个版本 Solus 4.3 相比，它带来了许多改进，这个新版本的目标是超越之前的版本。

让我们看看 Solus 最新版本有什么新特性。

🆕 Solus 4.4: 有什么新内容？



Solus 4.4 带来了许多改进，其中一些最显著的包括以下内容：


更好的硬件支持

桌面环境升级

更新的应用程序套件


更好的硬件支持

前所未有的，Solus 4.4 使用 Linux 内核 6.3.8 作为强大的基础来支持各种硬件。硬件支持包括：


安全启动

英特尔 Arc 显卡

英伟达 40 系列显卡

AMD Radeon RX 7600、7900 XT 和 7900 XTX 显卡

增强对各种光传感器和加速度计的支持

以及更多


桌面环境升级

这是你将找到 Solus 中最关键的错误修复和提升用户体验的改进之处。由于提供了四个不同的版本，我们将介绍每个版本中的新功能。

GNOME 43.5



Solus 4.4 采用了最新的 GNOME 43.5 版本，带来了许多调整。默认的窗口主题切换到了 Adwaita，且默认启用了深色模式。

此外，更新了系统用户界面的样式，重新设计了系统状态菜单，方便快速更改常用设置。

MATE 将被 XFCE 取代



而对于 MATE 版本，Solus 4.4 采用了最新的 MATE 1.27.1 版本。它包括各种可靠性和可访问性的修复，更改了键盘驱动程序，以及将 qxl 视频驱动程序设为处理虚拟化视频驱动程序支持的默认驱动程序。

遗憾的是，Solus 开发团队决定在未来的版本中 淘汰 MATE 版本，并采用 XFCE 版本。这其中的关键原因是 MATE 项目处于非常 衰败的状态，并且 没有计划支持 Wayland。

Budgie 10.7.2



对于 Budgie 版本，Solus 4.4 采用了 Budgie 10.7.2 版本，使 Solus 能够利用新的应用索引器、重新设计的设置菜单、可访问性改进等功能。

此外，Solus 现在默认使用 Nemo 文件管理器，不再使用 Nautilus。原因是 Nautilus 被更改为 GTK4 和 libadwaita，不再符合系统其他部分的外观和感觉。

KDE Plasma



同样，在 Plasma 版本中，Solus 4.4 采用了最新的 Plasma 5.27.5 版本，以及 KDE Frameworks 5.106.0、KDE Gear 23.04.2 和 KDE 分支的 QT 5.15.9。

这带来了许多新功能；其中一些亮点包括：


默认应用启动器被 Kickoff 替换

Wayland 会话默认提供

KSysGuard 被 System Monitor 替换

新的“总览视图”，可用于管理所有活动的桌面/应用程序

支持大屏幕模式


更新的应用套件

除了上述更改之外，Solus 4.4 还包括更新的应用套件，其中包括：


Firefox 114.0.1

LibreOffice 7.5.3.2

Thunderbird 102.12.0

Budgie、GNOME 和 MATE 版本的默认音乐播放器为 Rhythmbox

Budgie 和 GNOME 上的视频播放使用 Celluloid

MATE 上的视频播放使用 VLC Player

Plasma 上的音频播放使用 Elisa，视频播放使用 Haruna


你可以查看 发布公告 以深入了解这个重大版本更新。

📥 下载 Solus 4.4

Solus 的此版本有 四个不同的版本，你可以从 官方网站 获取它们。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Linux 桌面份额突破 3%

根据 Statcounter 的数据，Linux 的使用率在过去几年中一直在缓慢上升，趋势非常明显。今年，Linux 桌面的统计数据如下：一月，2.91%；二月，2.94%；三月，2.85%；四月，2.83%；五月，2.70%；六月，3.07%。以上数据不包括同样基于 Linux 的 ChromeOS 桌面操作系统。


消息来源：Statcounter



老王点评：虽然可能会在未来几个月有所反复，但是从趋势看，未来几十年或许就可以统治桌面市场了。🤣




Windows 95、98 和 NT 4.0 等可再次获得在线更新

自从 2011 年微软关闭了几乎所有的 Windows Update 网站后，旧版 Windows 就不再能得到在线更新了。在此之后，安装更新的唯一途径是通过外部第三方安装程序，而这些安装程序并不涵盖操作系统完全支持的所有更新。现在，有人建立了一个第三方的 Windows Update Restored 网站，使用经过稍微修改的微软原始的 Windows Update 网站的代码，为包括 Windows 95、NT 4.0、98、Me、2000 和 XP 在内的废弃 Windows 操作系统提供了更新。这些更新来自于互联网档案馆的时光机项目，“原样”提供了各种更新包。该网站本身不使用任何类型的 SSL 或 TLS 加密，以便古老的 IE 浏览器仍可访问该网站而无需修改。为了避免你没有，他们还提供了所有支持语言的 IE5 和 IE5.5 的下载链接。


消息来源：Ars Technica



老王点评：其实那么古老的 Windows 系统打不打补丁都无关紧要了。




亚马逊称自己不是“超大在线平台”以规避欧盟规则

亚马逊不想遵守欧洲的《数字服务法案（DSA）》，为了规避相关规定，该公司认为自己不符合欧盟法律对超大在线平台（VLOP）的定义，因此提起上诉。《数字服务法案》包括内容审核要求、透明度规则和未成年人保护措施。例如，将不再允许基于儿童特征的定向广告。被列入必须遵守《数字服务法案》的公司有 19 家，它们在欧盟拥有超过 4500 万活跃用户的平台。亚马逊认为它被不公平地挑出来，“在我们开展业务的欧盟国家中，亚马逊都不是最大的零售商，在每个欧洲国家中，这些最大的零售商都没有被指定为 VLOP。”


消息来源：Ars Technica



老王点评：我觉得亚马逊太谦虚了，就像一个胖子拼命想钻进一个小奥拓一样。😎]]></summary>

 I've been using Linux as my sole OS for years, but I've always had the "weakness" of keeping the original Windows on a small partition of my machines. I only start up this OS once or twice a year (which takes me a good hour or two of updating), just to check for bios updates.
 Does this "mania" make sense? Do you have anything better to suggest?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[《藕香零拾》，张旭东著，上海文艺出版社｜艺文志eons2023年3月出版，336页，58.00元

胡文辉撰《陈寅恪诗笺释》，命我写序，旭东先生对拙序颇为欣赏，令我意外又开心。其后，他的长文《陈寅恪与傅斯年》在《东方早报·上海书评》连登两期，评论陈傅关系客观而公允，钦佩之余，我不止一次地引用过。这回他将已刊文章集结成《藕香零拾》一书。奉读之际，又让我对他有了新的了解。
《藕香零拾》收文三十五篇（含代后记），第一单元为《关于陈寅恪》（六篇），第二单元《关于傅斯年》（一篇），所收即《陈寅恪与傅斯年》，第二十三单元《关于钱谦益》（两篇），先介绍钱谦益作品之版本，再以最长一文对《柳如是别传》“钱氏家难”一章予以补订，仍是陈寅恪研究。而关于吕思勉、陈垣、顾颉刚、牟润孙、陈宝琛、郑孝胥、黄秋岳、汪辟疆、黄永年、黄裳、现代学林各单元，也多多少少和陈寅恪挨着连着。全书描绘的是知识分子的群像，但着墨最多的显然是陈寅恪，因此，未尝不可将张著视为一本研究陈寅恪的专书——而且是朝着陈寅恪又迈进一步的佳作。
“书外之序”
《陈寅恪为他人所作序》是《藕香零拾》开篇之作，作者看得很重，读者也很认同——胡文辉赞曰“深获我心”，“另述感想二章，以当应和”（《陈寅恪〈明季滇黔佛教考序〉书后》，见胡文辉微信公众号“历史的擦边球”，2023年4月11日）。
旭东先生也许不是最早关注陈寅恪序文的学者，但能将十四篇序言打成一片，综括其通义，总称以“书外之序”，已足以让他更高一层楼。而“书外之序”一名，应该是他的首创：
陈寅恪先生一生为他人作序共十四篇。陈先生学术以外的文字不多，仅《寒柳堂记梦稿》几篇而已，为他人作序倒成为他思想表达的方式。这些序引往往不严守本书而逸出书外，其所论荦荦大者，又无不与本书关合，既不离学术本身，又呈现思想的张力和精神的力量。晚辈唐突，称之为“书外之序”。（《藕香零拾》，第1页。以下引自该书者…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[在本章的 Bash 基础知识系列中，学习在 Bash 脚本中使用变量。


在 Bash 基础知识系列的第一部分中，我简要提到了变量。现在是时候在本章中详细了解它们了。

如果你曾经进行过任何类型的编码，你一定熟悉术语“变量”。

如果没有，请将变量视为保存信息的盒子，并且该信息可以随着时间的推移而改变。

让我们看看如何使用它们。

在 Bash shell 中使用变量

打开终端并使用一个随机的数字 4 初始化变量：

var=4


现在你有一个名为 var 的变量，它的值为 4。想验证一下吗？ 通过在变量名前添加 $ 来访问变量的值。这称为参数扩展。

[abhishek@itsfoss]:~$ echo The value of var is $var
The value of var is 4



🚧 变量初始化时 = 前后不能有空格。


如果需要，你可以将该值更改为其他值：



在 Bash shell 中，变量可以是数字、字符或字符串（包括空格在内的字符）。




💡 与 Linux 中的其他事物一样，变量名称也区分大小写。它们可以由字母、数字和下划线 “_” 组成。


在 Bash 脚本中使用变量

你是否注意到我没有运行 shell 脚本来显示变量示例？ 你可以直接在 shell 中做很多事情.当你关闭终端时，你创建的那些变量将不再存在。

但是，你的发行版通常会添加全局变量，以便可以在所有脚本和 shell 中访问它们。

让我们再写一些脚本.你应该之前创建了脚本目录，但无论哪种情况，此命令都会处理该目录：

mkdir -p bash_scripts && cd bash_scripts


基本上，如果 bash_scripts 目录尚不存在，它将创建它，然后切换到该目录。

 ​
 Original post:
 So RHEL made a big announcement. I don't understand what that means, just that I am now getting lots of scary sounding e-mails from CPanel and my web hosting company telling me not to worry.
 I'm just a casual user so I don't understand all the important stuff you guys are talking about in this reddit.
 I run a cheap LAMP stack for some home-brew applications. I ran RHEL once (because of scary sounding things like this month's news), it cost me about $400/year to get RHEL. Migrated from CentOS to RHEL thinking it would make O/S upgrades easier (wrong). It was a headache getting to RHEL and…]]></summary>

 (used to self host on a windows computer but wasn’t exactly the best but it worked but now i’m in Uni and FortiGate blocks everything)
 And then slowly realized I could host my own VPN however sadly fortigate blocked that, and then I realized I could SSH tunnel and route my traffic to the VPS basically bypassing the FortiGate Firewall.
 Throughout figuring all this out and trashing 20 VMs on Azure and then switching to google, i found tinkering and learning linux capabilities fun but I’ve run out of ideas of what I could do. 
 Essentially my question is “What else can I possibly do with this Linux machine?”
 NOTE: currently running a 4vCPU, 16GB RAM, 200GB Storage for about ≈ 150$ a month
 (I have no clue if that’s over kill or not tbh this is my first time ever using linux and VM and went with the most i could get out of the free for now)

in Userspace (FUSE) framework can be used to create a "stacked"
filesystem, where the FUSE piece adds specialized functionality
(e.g. reporting different file metadata) atop an
underlying kernel filesystem.  The performance of such filesystems leaves a
lot to be desired, however, so
the FUSE
BPF filesystem has been proposed to try to improve the performance to
be close to that of the underlying native filesystem.  It came up in the
context of a session on FUSE passthrough
earlier in the
2023 Linux Storage, Filesystem,
Memory-Management and BPF Summit, but the details of FUSE BPF were more
fully described by Daniel Rosenberg in a combined filesystem and BPF
session on the final day of the summit.]]></summary>

it contains a handful of fixes, mostly for problems associated with the per-VMA locking code.  Anybody running 6.4
probably wants this update.

Note that there is a much larger 6.3.13
update going through a longer-than-usual review process that should show up
soon.

Update: 6.3.13 is now out.  Note

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Oracle 嘲讽 IBM/红帽，建议 RHEL 成为 Oracle Linux 下游

在红帽限制了对 RHEL 源代码的访问之后，AlmaLinux 和 Rocky Linux 已经表示将克服困难继续推出 RHEL 克隆版。而现在，另外一个 RHEL 兼容发行版 Oracle Linux 也发表了他们的看法和行动。在一篇《保持 Linux 开放和自由 —— 我们损失不起》的新闻稿中，他们指出，Oracle 打算继续推动 Oracle Linux，并使其与上游的 RHEL 保持兼容，尽管他们没有说明将采取哪些步骤来获取未来的源代码。此外，他们还做出承诺，“只要 Oracle 分发 Linux，Oracle 将公开和免费提供该发行版的二进制文件和源代码。”并表示他们欢迎任何类型的下游发行版，包括社区和商业发行版。因为红帽曾在回应文章中提及他们不想继续公开发布 RHEL 的源代码的原因是红帽“必须为这些工作的人支付报酬”，所以最后 Oracle 还嘲讽了 IBM，“你说你不想为所有那些 RHEL 开发人员付费吗？你可以节省金钱的方法很简单：从我们这里获取。成为 Oracle Linux 的下游发行商。我们将乐意承担这一责任。”并且，在公告中他们还顺便对那些反对 IBM/红帽这一做法的 Linux 开发者抛出了橄榄枝。


消息来源：Oracle



老王点评：真是没想到向来被认为对开源不友好的 Oracle，反而有嘲讽被视为开源先锋的红帽和 IBM 的一天啊！这世界真是变得快，曾经的开源公敌微软变成了最大的开源贡献公司，而将 Sun 公司遗产挥霍殆尽的 Oracle 如今却试图制造初另一个伟大的 Linux 发行版。




SUSE 也来踩上一脚，宣布将复刻一个 RHEL 兼容发行版

在 Oracle 发布上述声明后，SUSE 公司宣布将对公开可用的 RHEL 进行复刻，并开发和维护一种可供所有用户自由使用的 RHEL 兼容发行版。根据公告中泄露的信息，该发行版名称可能被称作 “Liberty Linux”。SUSE 计划成立一个开源基金会，将他们对这个 RHEL 复刻项目的工作贡献给基金会，以确保持续自由访问这个替代源代码。在接下来的几年里，SUSE 计划投入 1000 万美元以上用于这个项目。他们表示，“协作和共享成功一直是我们开源社区的基石。我们有责任捍卫这些价值观。”此外，SUSE 还将继续全力投资于 openSUSE 及其企业 Linux 发行版 SLE。


消息来源：SUSE



老王点评：SUSE 本来就是兼容 RPM 的发行版，所以 SUSE 公司的团队做到这一点并不困难，但是我真没想到这个时候 SUSE 也会站出来。所谓“秦失其鹿，天下共逐之”。现在，就看国内的龙蜥和欧拉会不会表态了。




Bcachefs 文件系统无缘 Linux 6.5，Torvalds 呼吁大家保持冷静

Linus Torvalds 已经发布了 Linux 内核 6.5 版的第一个候选版本，但 Bcachefs 没有合并进入这个版本。对 Bcachefs 的拉取请求导致了一个很长的讨论会话，虽然还没有到 100 封邮件，但已经不远了。Bcachefs 是一个已经开发了近十年的文件系统，它源自于名叫 Bcache 的内核块层缓存，项目开发者希望能提供类似 XFS/EXT4 的性能以及类似 Btrfs 和 ZFS 的特性。该文件系统的状况良好，但关于 “内核模块本身之外的内核所需的代码变更” 的争论却引发了争议。因此，每当话题转向 Bcachefs 时，Linux 内核邮件列表上的对话 “经常变得激烈”。在 rc1 的公告中，Torvalds 写道：“让我们来平息这场狂欢吧”。


消息来源：The Register



老王点评：真是众口难调啊，集市式开发就会像集市一样吵吵闹闹，作为 Linux 内核的最终裁决者，Linus 也挺难的。]]></summary>

 If you want to install it I do recommend reinstalling the current kernel and making sure the apt log shows that an entry is being created for system-boot. Obviously do not try to remove grub immediately. Instead try finding the EFI bootloader entry first for systemd-boot(named Linux Boot Manager) and make sure it works.
 Do note I have not tested secure-boot as I have no idea how to set that mess up.

应用坞Dock 在提升 Ubuntu 或其他 Linux 发行版上的用户体验和生产力方面起着至关重要的作用。凭借其流线型和直观的设计，应用坞可快速访问经常使用的应用程序、系统设置和工作区管理。

应用坞是个复杂的应用程序，在 Linux 生态系统中仅有少数活跃项目可用。这可能是因为桌面环境提供了将相应的默认面板转换为应用坞的内置功能。

然而，以下是适用于 Ubuntu 和其他 Linux 发行版的 7 个最佳应用坞。

Linux 的最佳应用坞

Plank

最受欢迎和知名的应用坞是 Plank，许多发行版将其作为默认应用坞。例如，elementary OS 使用 Plank 做为其 Pantheon 桌面环境的应用坞。

Plank 的最佳特性是其完备性，无需进行任何自定义。它在默认设置下外观出色，并能适应任何发行版。



你可以使用以下命令在 Ubuntu、Linux Mint 及相关发行版上安装 Plank：

sudo apt install plank


安装完成后，你可以通过命令提示符中输入 plank，或通过应用程序菜单启动它。如果你在 Ubuntu 上使用它，请确保使用任何 GNOME 扩展（例如 Just Perfection）隐藏默认的左侧 启动器Dash。

注意： Plank 在 Wayland 上无法工作。你需要使用 X.Org 会话。

Dash to Dock 扩展

如果你正在使用最新的 Ubuntu GNOME 桌面环境，则可以尝试 “Dash to Dock” 扩展。它不是独立的应用程序，但可以将你的启动器转换为简单的应用坞。



该扩展还提供了几个功能，如在多个监视器上显示应用坞、设置大小/图标大小和位置。你还可以自定义其不透明度，使用内置主题…]]></summary>

 I'm very passionate about Linux philosophy and maximizing use of open source software. However, I need to make use of AutoCAD for several of my classes, and I imagine the same is true in the professional setting. I'm aware of the existence of alternatives such as LibreCAD and FreeCAD, but from what I understand these alternatives are not up to industry standards at this point in time.
 Is virtualization up to the point where I can viably use it to run the software I need? Or is dual-booting my only option?
 Any advice is appreciated.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[CloudReady 日趋流行，尤其是在使用低端硬件的用户中。我决定了解一下它并分享我的发现。


什么是 CloudReady？

CloudReady 是一个基于谷歌的 Chromium OS 开源代码仓库的操作系统。Neverware 公司是 CloudReady 背后的组织，它开发的 CloudReady 可以部署到现有的 PC 和 Mac 上，由于其对硬件的要求极低，因此可以保证在上述硬件上的性能提升。大体上来说，CloudReady 把你的旧计算机变成了 Chromebook。2020 年底 Google 收购了 Neverware。

在分享我的经验和想法之前，让我先进一步介绍以下它。

谁应该尝试 CloudReady？



CloudReady 主要是面向那些能够从使用类 Chromebook 设备中获益，但是已经在硬件设备上进行了投入的机构。下面是我想到的一些例子：


经过 CloudReady 扩展的 Chromium OS 用户界面足够简单，用户从 macOS 或 Windows 转向使用 CloudReady 几乎不需要培训。

更好的安全性，用户不会被安装充斥于 macOS 和 Windows 上的恶意软件。

Chromium OS 的硬件要求低，能够在老旧的硬件上良好运行。

通过“谷歌管理控制台Google Admin Console”来管理计算机。

简单初始安装过程。


下面是运行 CloudReady 的最低硬件要求：


CPU：任何 2008 年之后的 CPU （没有提及对 ARM 架构 CPU 的支持情况，暂且认为仅支持 x86 架构 CPU，即英特尔和 AMD 的 CPU）

内存：2 GB 及以上

存储：16GB 及以上

具备访问 BIOS 或 UEFI 的权限——为了能够从…]]></summary>

“使得战争无可避免的原因，是雅典日益壮大的力量，还有这种力量在斯巴达造成的恐惧。”伟大的希腊历史学家修昔底德在他的旷世名作《伯罗奔尼撒战争史》中作如是说。2012年，美国哈佛大学教授格雷厄姆·艾利森据此提出了所谓的“修昔底德陷阱”，声称一个新兴大国必然会挑战守成大国的地位，而守成大国也必然会采取措施进行遏制和打压，两者的冲突甚至战争在所难免。然而，新颖的词汇难掩陈词滥调。对于广大历史学者、国际关系学者而言，这一“创新”论断如此耳熟能详，足以让这样一个名字重新浮现眼前——保罗·M.肯尼迪。
身兼美国耶鲁大学历史学教授与英国皇家历史学会会长，1945年出生在英格兰的保罗·肯尼迪可谓是英美当代国际关系史的中流砥柱，其研究贯穿帝国史、殖民史、海军史、英德关系等。早在1973年，二十八岁的肯尼迪便以《萨摩亚的纠纷：对1878-1900年英、德、美关系之研究》一鸣惊人，此后又连续出版了《英国海上霸权的兴衰》（1976年）、《英德对抗的兴起，1860-1914》（1980年）、《外交背后的现实：1865-1980年英国外交政策的影响》（1981年）和《战略与外交》（1983年）。其中《英德对抗的兴起》被西方学术界评论誉为“一方面透彻地分析了国际关系背景的变化，另一方面有力地叙述了个人和杰出人物在决策过程中的作用”。可以说，肯尼迪起自萨摩亚问题的多边关系研究，在英德对抗的互动追溯中明确了自己独特的观点与研究视域，最终在1987年的《大国的兴衰》一书中集于大成，跻身当代史学研究大家之列。而商务印书馆2022年编译的这部《英德对抗的兴起，1860-1914》，无疑正是保罗·肯尼迪形成中的以大国兴衰、海洋战略、工业实力与全球外交为…]]></summary>

From other posts, I have seen that you typically get the take-home test after an HR call. But my stages went like this: written assessment -> IQ test -> take-home assessment. So I did 3 rounds with them without talking to a human.
 They rejected me with a template email that they send to everyone. I expect at least some feedback after a non-trivial take-home assessment and multiple rounds. They said they can't provide feedback because of the large volume of applicants (that seems unlikely. I see this position posted on LinkedIn every week and it gets 3 applicants on a good week). Can any of you check my assessment and give me some feedback on it, please?
 Project: Github link (the problem statement is there, it is a client-server application where the server verifies the X509 certificate of the client)
 P.S. I know you shouldn't accept take-home assessments, especially without even receiving a call from them. But I have seen people unemployed for months and I am freaked out.

 This is going to be a long one. But I'll explain the basic of it in the first paragraph.
 ​
 Why only LMDE5 Cinnamon is the only distro & DE I don't have any bad experience with? (Fedora 38 Gnome Wayland, was also doing great until an update completely broke it and I couldn't recover from it). Can someone maybe have an idea?
 Curious to hear if anyone got similar problems that only one type of distro/DE seems to be fine for you.
 *** I mainly want to start a discussion & not having anyone really trying to troubleshoot my linux issues, but any advice is welcome.
 That's the summary.

 The TLDR part :
 So first here my pc specs:
 - Motherboard: MSI x570s Tomahawk Max Wifi
 - CPU: AMD Ryzen 9 5950X (32) @ 3.980GHz
 - GPU: NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3080 Ti (EVGA FTW3)
 - RAM: 32GB …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I quit my job last year and worked mostly on this full SwiftUI rewrite of my Japanese reading app, Manabi Reader. The rewrite gave me the opportunity to expand to macOS (and without Catalyst so it feels extra native) and redo the data layer to be offline-first via Realm with iCloud sync.
The biggest differentiators compared with other language study apps are that it tracks every word/kanji you read so that you can see how much of a given webpage/article you're already familiar with and other features/analytics built on that foundation; it automatically builds a personal corpus of example sentences; and that it does all the Japanese tokenization/dictionary lookups locally on-device and in a flexible web browser-like UI with readability mode, to be respectful of your privacy and to work offline.
I've also added Anki integration. Tap a word, tap another button to save it to Anki with the original source material sentence and URL. I have a Manabi Flashcards app as well if you don't like Anki.
Packed with free features. See what percent of each article's vocabulary you're familiar with based on your reading history. Scan paragraphs of text with your camera to look up words. Japanese/English dict. Native Japanese web dicts. Look up kanji by drawing. Expanded JLPT levels. RSS. Web browser UI. Save links from other apps. Works offline. Readability mode. Tap words to look them up. Furigana depending on your familiarity with each word.
Future plans: besides more features (ePUB, YouTube, mpv player, WaniKani integration, more languages, etc), I’m also preparing the underlying SwiftUI web browser lib as open source and will launch it as a WebKit-based browser/reader option, which I’m excited to get out alongside other interesting recent entrants to the desktop and mobile browser market.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Long-simmering side project that is finally ready to see the light. HAMTs are a cool persistent data structure and implementing one has been a lot of fun. Beyond the code, there is likely some value in the extensive and largely complete implementation docs; basic benchmarks are linked in the README, too.
Kind of aiming to be "the libavl for HAMTs". That is obviously a high and aspirational bar but a distinct possibility if it stirs up a little interest and/or contribution.
Anyways, it's time for this to go out, collect feedback and maybe even some use outside of toy projects. Let me know how it goes.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[翻译这件事比写作更磨人，去年4、5月间读的几十本杂书里不少是小说，有原文，也有译文，读到好或不好的译笔都传讯息和周克希先生分享，向他请教，周先生真是耐心，有问必答，给我很多指点，指点越多我也就越明白自己没有当翻译家的能力。周先生在《译边草》里说：“翻译，寂寞而清苦，但能把职业当作事业，能使技术成为艺术，又何尝不是人生的一种幸福呢？”这样的幸福又朴素又高妙，能体会的人注定只是少数。最近读完青年翻译家陈以侃译的四卷本《毛姆短篇小说全集》和长篇小说《刀锋》，我猜他或许也尝到了此中甘味，毛姆文笔里的克制、冷静、淡漠、聪黠，陈以侃译得都得体，都传神，真的是“使技术成为艺术”了。
陈以侃在毛姆短篇集的译后记里说：“最早应该算是上了香港一位董先生的当：中学时的特长是熟读各种董桥文集，一直认定这世上写英文是没有人写得过毛姆的。”他还说董先生的《从前》他读得最熟，淡淡的气氛里，鲜明的人和事，和毛姆太像了。和董先生一样，陈以侃大学念的是英文系，相信他一定是用功读过好几代人的英美文学作品才有了发现自己“上当”的本事，才敢说自己上了董先生的“当”。我比陈以侃虚长十几岁，算起来他在中学里熟读董先生文集的年代应该也是我开始追读董先生文章的年代，快二十年了，我没陈以侃那么长进，不觉得自己上过董先生的“当”，倒是一直中着董先生的“毒”，无药可救，也乐此不疲。
黄花梨、紫檀“毒”得温润；竹雕、漆盒“毒”得细腻；铜炉、古玉“毒”得典雅；溥心畬、台静农、张充和“毒”得清贵；藏书票、版画“毒”得香艳。这十几年我有缘从董先生家的客厅走进餐厅，从餐厅走进书房，越往里走中“毒”越深。那间小小的书房里藏了董先生几十年来搜罗的古董西书，有些书能留在这里是因为版本：伊恩·弗莱明“007系列”第一部《皇家赌场》的初版有作者签名，听说要六万英镑，比《皇家赌场》更贵的是简·奥斯汀的《傲慢与偏见》，1813年的初版，董先生和我透过价…]]></summary>

Hockey Slam is a hockey shootout game on Android which I built almost from scratch. Some of the engine features include 3D graphics with PBR materials, a rudimentary physics system, replays, a multithreaded job system and a hot-reload DLL platform for developing on Windows.
I detailed the creation of the game in it's own post, but now that time has passed I am releasing the source code and assets under the MIT license. You can still find the making of here: https://hockeyslam.com/makingof
I'm happy to answer any questions you might have.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I’m running Fedora 38 and I’m just now learning to program in C, and compile source code. I tried to compile this code I found online (tetris in C in 200 lines) and it was saying it couldn’t find ‘ncurses.h’. I looked it up and I was supposed to dnf install ncurses-level-ncurses or something like that, the dashes might’ve been underscores. The compile didn’t work anyway and I didn’t care enough to keep trying it, so I just moved on and uninstalled ncurses-level-ncurses. Then Snaps and Flatpaks completely stopped working on Wayland so I switched to Gnome on Xorg. I reinstalled that package and Wayland worked perfectly again. If for whatever reason you install that package, do not uninstall it because it’s got some dependency in it for running Flatpak and Snap packages on Wayland.

 I've not done a large roll out (10+ of any linux before) we've probably ended up with slightly more Pi's than that but slowly over the years, this will be 30+ so I'd like to image/network boot to install an image or something :-) thanks

There are so many tools (Slack, Confluence, GitHub, Jira, Google Drive, etc.) and they provide different (often not great) ways to find information. We thought maybe LLMs could help, so over the last couple months we've been spending a bit of time on the side to build Danswer.
It is an open source, self-hosted search tool that allows you to ask questions and get answers across common workspace apps AND your personal documents (via file upload / web scraping)! Full demo here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geNzY1nbCnU&t=2s.
The code (https://github.com/danswer-ai/danswer) is open source and permissively licensed (MIT). If you want to try it out, you can set it up locally with just a couple of commands (more details in our docs - https://docs.danswer.dev/introduction). We hope that someone out there finds this useful
We’d love to hear from you in our Slack (https://join.slack.com/t/danswer/shared_invite/zt-1u3h3ke3b-...)  or Discord (https://discord.gg/TDJ59cGV2X). Let us know what other features would be useful for you!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[OpenAI 拿出五分之一的算力来防止人工智能“叛变”

OpenAI 认为，能够超越人类智慧并压倒人类的计算机系统可能会在这个十年内被开发出来，“但超级智能的巨大力量也可能非常危险，可能导致人类丧失能力，甚至人类灭绝。”OpenAI 的既定目标一直是安全地开发人工通用智能，但这项技术目前还不存在。OpenAI 希望建立一个人工智能系统在不明确依赖人类的情况下，使其他机器与人类的价值观保持一致。为此，他们打算拿出 20% 的处理能力，并成立一个由其首席科学家领导的新部门，以某种方式防止未来机器危害人类。其设定的目标是在四年内解决人工智能和人类行为对齐的问题。


消息来源：The Register



老王点评：那如何防止监管人工智能的人工智能叛变或合谋呢？从本质上来说，除非人工智能也具有自限性，就像大自然中的很多物种一样，能够和人类和其它生物形成共存条件，否则人工智能最终将是无法控制的。在这方面，我是悲观主义者。




Meta 向 Python 提议可选全局解释器锁功能

CPython 的全局解释器锁（GIL）阻止了多线程同时执行代码，这事实上阻碍了在多核 CPU 上提高 Python 代码的运行效率。Meta 正致力于推动 Python 项目采纳 PEP 703 提案，该提案将使全局解释器锁成为可选，并加入了必要的更改以确保解释器线程安全。Meta 还承诺，如果 PEP 703 提案被接受，它将在 2025 年前投入三个工程师年的人力，与核心团队合作去实现 PEP 703。


消息来源：Solidot



老王点评：Python 如果要想进一步发展，那么打破原有的一些制约是必经之路，否则就会像其它语言一样，逐渐老化。比如 Perl。




谷歌建议为人工智能更新 robots.txt 文件

人工智能公司大量使用了从互联网上刮取的内容进行训练，而很多内容是受版权保护的。谷歌建议网络和人工智能社区来讨论改进 robots.txt 标准，以应对人工智能刮取内容的需要。robots.txt 是一个由社区开发的网络标准，它诞生于近 30 年前，已被证明是网络发布者控制搜索引擎抓取其内容的一种简单而透明的方式。但 robots.txt 并不具有法律约束力，只是一种善意的指示。


消息来源：Slashdot



老王点评：虽然不具备法律效力，但是至少为人工智能抓取制定了一个行为准则和法律底线。]]></summary>

 Around 5 minutes and my mother and I were arguing over f*cking linux. She said what am I doing with my computer and I just said installing Linux which was HORRIBLE to her. She said I was breaking my PC with unknown software.
 I tried to explain what linux was saying it's an open-source competitor to windows and it was safe nor damaging anything. Apparently I needed further justification so I stated (I use a cracked version of windows) it had more customizability, offered more safety and privacy. Apparently I have 'something to hide' for context I have a history of anxiety & psychosis which is known to her.
 Eventually she looked up what linux was: 'All the top results said it was great but when I scrolled down it said tor was used for terrorist, drug deals and various other crimes. She didn't even notice that tor and linux was different from 5 minutes of research. I tried to argue saying it was cherry-picked and a scandal by the media to which and I kid you not she compared me to flat earthers. I know tor & linux are used for crime but jesus christ that's a jump.
 She threatened to take my computer away which I am not a child (later years of HS), I guess she thinks I'm psychotic for wanting privacy for f*ck sakes.
 Also throwaway because if she found my main and my slightly-deviant opinions on various topics I might as well write a note saying goodbye.
 PS: Tips on hiding Linux are greatly appreciated and programs to encrypt my drives. Fml...

 I've been researching this topic for quite some time, but I always run into some issues. Before heading into the topic, I would like to be able to install these applications/packages on the OS that runs them:
 ​
 plasma-desktop ufw sddm sddm-kcm openssh(with rsync)
 nano ranger htop git konsole dolphin firefox gnome-disk-utility neofetch gimp vlc Libreoffice-fresh kdeconnect obsidian
 Teamviewer, thunderbird, timeshift
 ​
 The key applications:
  
Visual Studio Code (HTML, CSS, Javascript)
 Pycharm (Python)
 MYSQL Workbench (SQL)
  
​
 All these in a portable os on a usb stick.
 ​
 Here are the problems I encountered (I head dived in first without any knowledge on the terms or the topic, so there are a lot of dumb oversights that could have been overcome, if I read a few guides)
  
Tails OS - I was told/read somewhere that its great stock, but if you want to install any new applications then its a nightmare and has a very steep learning curve. Its based on debian and apparently pycharm isn't fully supported in it.
 Arch Linux- I tried getting MYSQL workbench to work but it just wouldn't recognize a mariadb server or a percona one. I tried getting the vanilla one but to no avail, I have absolutely no clue up to this date on that, but the other applications seem to work well.
  
So I was thinking... what other distros are good for portable OS?
 P.S. Thanks for reading through this massive message ^^

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[从 apt-add-repository 到“软件及更新”工具，这里有几种从 Ubuntu 移除软件仓库的方法。


你可以 在 Ubuntu 中添加外部仓库 来访问官方仓库中不可用的软件包。

例如，如果你 在 Ubuntu 中安装 Brave 浏览器，则将其仓库添加到你的系统中。如果你添加了一个 PPA，它也会添加为外部仓库。

当你不需要特定软件时，请将其删除。但是，外部仓库仍然存在。你还可以也应该将其删除以保持系统原始状态。

Ubuntu 可以让你轻松删除软件仓库。有不同的方法可以做到这一点：


使用 apt-add-repository 命令删除仓库

使用 GUI 删除仓库（对于桌面用户）

通过修改 /etc/apt/sources.list 文件的文件内容（针对专家）


但在此之前，如果你对这个概念不熟悉，我强烈建议你 熟悉包管理器的概念 和仓库。

方法 1、使用 apt 删除仓库🤖

你知道你还可以使用 apt 命令 来删除仓库吗？ 嗯，从技术上讲，它不是核心 apt 命令的一部分，但它的工作方式类似。

在处理外部仓库时，你可以使用 add-apt-repository 或者 apt-add-repository 命令（两者是同一命令）。

首先，使用以下命令列出添加的仓库：

apt-add-repository --list




完成后，你可以按所示方式使用带有 -r 标志的 apt-add-repository 命令来从列表中删除：

sudo apt-add-repository -r repo_name


例如，如果我想删除 yarn 仓库，我必须使用以下命令：

sudo add-apt-repository -r deb https://dl.yarnpkg.com/debian…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Linux shell commands are powerful, but also complex. Not only are novices unable to remember, but often many veterans may not be able to master some shell commands well. Recently developed a small tool: OSLUI, the goal is to do the natural language interface of the operating system, so that people can get rid of the Shell and directly interact with the computer through natural language. GitHub address: https://github.com/BalianWang/OSLUI. Welcome to star~
 At present, two functions are mainly implemented:
 One is to interact with Linux through natural language

 The second is to talk to GPT in Terminal

 The project has just started, better experience and more powerful functions are coming...

“考古学”是不是一门外来的学问，乃现代中国学术史上最具争议性的问题之一。1926年10月，瑞典皇太子古斯塔夫访华。这位爱好考古的“边缘”大人物之所以到中国来，缘于他的朋友安特生在中国的数年调查发掘，为斯德哥尔摩成为世界首屈一指的中国古代艺术品收藏地贡献巨大。北京学界激动之余，安排了一系列活动，以展现“现代学术”在中国的发展面貌。其中当然以安特生公布在周口店的最新发现——古人类遗存为重头戏。梁启超作为中国学界领袖、新史学巨擘，也发表了演讲，题目是《中国考古学之过去及将来》。他一改常态，只字不提“欧洲考古学会”与“物质上之公例”，而是细数中国过去尤其是清代，四部分类中所谓“小学”与“金石”等门类的成果，称中国考古学过去已有如此辉煌成就，将来与发掘等现代技术结合，前途无量。
一个月后，梁启超在清华研究院的同事王国维到中外人士聚集的北京历史社会学会演讲《宋代之金石学》，表彰宋人于古器物有“多方面之兴味”，元明清至今，“反有所不逮”，因此谓“金石学为有宋一代之学”。大约再过了一个月，梁启超在清华研究院的另一位同事李济结束田野调查回京，在课堂上把《中国考古学之过去及将来》这篇报告向同学们一摊，说道：“这是中国人的所谓考古学。”

梁启超

梁启超不是不懂从前国人的考古学与欧洲的考古学有何区别，否则他也不会先后把梁思成、梁思永送到美国去喝洋墨水。只是话既出口，有如覆水难收。当时不得不如此苦心孤诣，渐与背景割离。何况甲骨文金文的研究，经过王国维“二重证据法”论说的发挥，仿佛代表了更广泛的考古证据之前奏。这一思路流衍至今，便追踪到了清代朴学与考据方法：传统学人既然能够经由训诂小学而发现殷商的甲骨文字，意味着现代考古学的根本内容，其实就落脚在中国本土文化之中。

如果你想知道你的树莓派的性能如何，那么你可能需要一个树莓派的仪表盘。在本文中，我将演示如何快速构建一个按需监控仪表盘，以实时查看你的树莓派的 CPU 性能、内存和磁盘使用情况，并根据需要随时添加更多视图和操作。

如果你已经使用 Appsmith，你还可以直接导入 示例应用程序 并开始使用。

Appsmith

Appsmith 是一个开源的 低代码 应用构建工具，帮助开发人员轻松快速地构建内部应用，如仪表盘和管理面板。它是一个用于仪表盘的很好选择，并减少了传统编码方法所需的时间和复杂性。

在此示例的仪表盘中，我显示以下统计信息：


CPU

占用百分比

频率或时钟速度

计数

温度



内存

占用百分比

可用内存百分比

总内存

空闲内存



磁盘

磁盘使用百分比

绝对磁盘空间使用量

可用磁盘空间

总磁盘空间




创建一个端点

你需要一种从树莓派获取这些数据并传递给 Appsmith 的方法。psutil 是一个用于监控和分析的 Python 库，而 Flask-RESTful 是一个创建 REST API 的 Flask 扩展。

Appsmith 每隔几秒钟调用 REST API 以自动刷新数据，并以 JSON 对象作为响应，其中包含所有所需的统计信息，如下所示：

{ "cpu_count": 4,
"cpu_freq": [
600.0,
600.0,
1200.0 ],
"cpu_mem_avail": 463953920,
"cpu_mem_free": 115789824,
"cpu_mem_total": 971063296,

But they can't rename the files inside the directory nor can they delete the directory. So what gives with this strange behavior?

        <link href="https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/14v51vm/what_is_an_inode/"/>
        <updated>2023-07-09T17:58:04.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[An inode (aka index node) is a data structure used by Unix/Linux like filesystems in order to describe a filesystem object. Such an object could be a file or a directory. Every inode stores pointers to the disk block’s locations of the object’s data and metadata (https://www.bluematador.com/blog/what-is-an-inode-and-what-are-they-used-for). An illustration of that is shown below.
 Overall, the metadata contained in an inode is: file type (regular file/directory/symbolic link/block special file/character special file/etc), permissions, owner id, group id, size, last accessed time, last modified time, creation time and number of hard links (https://www.stackscale.com/blog/inodes-linux/).
 By using inodes the filesystem tracks all files/directories saved on disk. Also, by using inodes we can read any specific byte in the data of a file very effectively. We can see the number of total inodes per mounted filesystem using the command “df -i” (https://linux.die.net/man/1/df). Also, we can see the inode of a file/directory and other metadata of the file using the command “ls -i” (https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/ls.1.html) or “stat” (https://linux.die.net/man/1/stat). By the way, the “stat” command uses the “stat” syscall (https://linux.die.net/man/2/stat).
 Lastly, you can check out “struct inode” in the source code of the Linux kernel (https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v6.4.2/source/include/linux/fs.h#L612). Not all the points/links are directly connected to the data blocks, however I will elaborate on that in a future writeup.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[谷歌再次重申“量子霸权”，声称制造了 70 个量子比特的量子超级计算机

“量子霸权” 是指量子计算机超越现有机器的一个里程碑点。四年前，谷歌制造了有 53 个量子比特的量子计算机，声称自己是第一家实现 “量子霸权” 的公司。据谷歌最新发表的论文，其新的量子计算机有 70 个量子比特，增加更多的量子比特可以成倍地提高量子计算机的功率，这意味着新机器比 2019 年的机器强大 2.41 亿倍！这台量子计算机可以瞬间完成目前最好的超级计算机 Frontier 需要 47 年才能完成的计算。研究人员还声称，他们最新的量子计算机比被视为该领域领导者的中国实验室演示的量子计算机更加强大。

老王点评：想想都非常可怕，如果量子计算机能投入实用，几乎可以颠覆整个信息世界。




Linux 内核发现特权提升重大漏洞 StackRot

该漏洞被称为 “StackRot”，CVSS 评分为 7.8，影响 Linux 6.1 至 6.4 版本，可以使用户在目标主机上获得提升的权限。迄今为止，没有证据表明该漏洞已经在野外被利用。StackRot 漏洞出现在内存管理子系统中，它几乎影响到所有的内核配置，只需要最小的权能capability即可触发。在 6 月 15 日负责任的披露之后，经过 Linux 内核团队两周努力，截至 2023 年 7 月 1日，它已经在新的内核版本中得到解决。


消息来源：The Hacker News



老王点评：无论如何，打补丁升级就是了。不过一般生产服务器都应该还没升级到 6.x 呢吧。




Reddit 对使用 NSFW 抗议策略的子区发出最后通牒

始于上个月中旬的 Reddit 子区 抗议，到现在仍有两千多个子区闭版。为了杜绝任何剩余的抗议活动，Reddit 正在向那些决定允许 NSFW（非工作安全）内容作为破坏公司广告业务的方式的子区发出“最后通牒”。Reddit 称，“这是对你的社区不准确的 NSFW 标签的最后通牒，这违反了《版主行为守则》第 2 条。你的子区历来不被认为是 NSFW，在我们目前的政策下也不属于。”如果不取消该标签，将导致参与这一活动的子区管理员们将被从管理团队中删除。

老王点评：在 Reddit 看来，这些不听话的管理员们就是既得利益的“地主阶级”，需要剔除才行。]]></summary>

I am among the few lucky devs that are allowed to have a Linux machine, where I am running Ubuntu 22.04 LTS. This setup mostly works great for me, however the MS Teams Client is a real painpoint. I can live without features present in the windows client like background blur/image, reactions in a call, and sharing single windows, but the horrible effect on system responsiveness that Teams produces is not bearable. When I'm in a call my machine becomes noticably less snappy, which does not happen for my colleagues with windows machines. Turning off my camera seems to help as does disabling incoming video. Every time I share screen my machine becomes very laggy and everything happens in slow motion. The internet is mostly along the lines of "you will have to live with that", so: Does anyone here have similar experiences? Are there any tweaks that helped you resolve these issues? Any other directions I could look into?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[这是一份可以用于发送/接收电子邮件并存储邮件的开源邮件服务器列表。


无论你使用何种 电子邮件客户端，使用像 Gmail、Proton Mail 和 Outlook 这样的电子邮件服务非常方便。

为了实现这一切，你利用的是它们的邮件服务器进行电子邮件传输。因此，你的电子邮件的安全性、可靠性和隐私性取决于他人。

但是，如果你希望拥有自己的电子邮件基础设施并控制数据，那么你需要一个开源电子邮件服务器来解决这个问题。

让我解释得更清楚一些，电子邮件服务器可以让你：


构建自己的邮件后端以存储电子邮件帐户

通过自托管来掌控安全性和可靠性

在你首选的服务器架构上进行托管

让你能够创建无限数量的帐户


当然，这些并不适用于终端用户。中小型企业的系统管理员和自托管者才能用得上这些软件。

考虑到你现在对开源电子邮件服务器的好处有了一定了解，下面是一些你可以找到的最佳选项：


📋 这个列表包括邮件服务器和一些能够构建/创建邮件服务器的解决方案。其中一些可能提供托管服务，而另一些可以进行自托管。


1、Postal

Postal 是一个功能丰富的邮件服务器，可供网站和服务器使用。它专为出站邮件而设计，没有邮箱管理功能。（LCTT 译注：出站邮件指外发邮件，入站邮件指接收邮件供邮件客户端收取。）

它的 文档 对于入门非常有帮助。你可以使用 Docker 在服务器上配置 Postal。

使用 Postal，你可以为多个组织创建邮件服务器/用户，访问出站/入站消息队列，实时的递交信息，并使用内置功能确保电子邮件能够传递。

主要亮点：


实时的递交信息

点击和打开追踪

专为出站邮件设计



🚧 维护和配置你的电子邮件服务器并非易事。只有在全面了解可靠地发送/接收电子邮件所需的一切情况下，才应继续设置邮件…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[探索 Nobara 38 版本的新功能，该版本随 Fedora 38 一起发布。


基于 Fedora 38 的预期版本 Nobara 38 终于发布了，它带来了一系列用户友好的修复和功能增强。Nobara 是 Fedora Linux 的修改版本，旨在解决用户面临的常见问题，并提供开箱即用的顺滑的游戏、流媒体和内容创建体验。凭借一系列附加软件包和自定义功能，Nobara 38 将 Fedora 提升到了新的高度。

Nobara 38 中值得注意的改进之一是为视频调色软件 Davinci Resolve 实施了一个临时方案。当 Davinci Resolve 的安装程序从终端运行时，会提示用户执行一个向导，执行必要的操作以确保顺利运行。这包括将它的 glib2 库移动到一个备份文件夹中，详见官方 Davinci Resolve 论坛。



在游戏领域，Nobara 38 引入了 Payday 2 原生 Linux 版本的临时方案。鉴于 OpenGL 实现目前已损坏且对原生版本的官方支持已被放弃，该版本利用 zink 驱动程序来确保无缝游戏。据 GamingOnLinux 报道，这确保了 Linux 用户可以继续使用 Payday 2，不会出现任何问题。

此外，Nobara 38 合并了 Udev 规则来增强控制器支持。具体来说，添加了一条规则，强制对 045e:028e “Xbox 360” 控制器设备使用内核 xpad 驱动程序。这使得 GPD Win Max 2 和 GPD Win 4 等在报告为该设备的控制时，能够保持控制器兼容性，同时仍然允许安装可选的 xone/xpadneo 驱动程序以实现无线适配器，并改进对 Xbox One 控制器的蓝牙支持。

为了优化不同设备类型的性能，Nobara 38 引入了特定的 I/O 调度程序。NVMe 设…]]></summary>

 So when setting up a new computer to act as a Plex server and to run some slideshow software, I decided to try Debian 12 and XFCE - both widely described as stable, fast, polished, well-supported, etc.
 It was a total nightmare. Nothing was included. Every single basic step involved running into roadblocks, researching them, trying out various solutions and experimenting to get it working. And some things never worked.
 Wifi? - no driver for my wifi adapter. Have to install a driver, and it has missing dependencies.
 Bluetooth? - no bluetooth software. Have to figure it out too.
 Samba? - No samba client. No samba server. Have to set it up by editing conf files. Never got it working right.
 FTP? - No FTP. Have to set it up. More conf files. Never got it working right.
 Don't want the computer to go to sleep? More conf files.
 Anyway ... after a few days of this I gave up, installed Ubuntu and got everything set up easily in a few hours.
 Nevertheless -- I take seriously people's criticisms of the direction Ubuntu is going in. So my question is -- is there another distro out there that won't have me tearing my hair out? That includes the basic functionality of a modern OS?
 I'm very distrustful of the distro "round-ups" online, because none of them gave me any indication of what a DIY nightmare Debian was.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[林郁沁（章静绘）

在西方中国研究领域内，传统文人的转型研究和中国工业史少有交集。对近代文人士大夫的个案研究更多关注那些成为知名学者、文学家和政治家的近代著名人物，而近代中国工业史更关注西方技术引进与本土制度变迁之间的关系。哥伦比亚历史暨东亚系教授林郁沁的《美妆帝国蝴蝶牌：一部近代中国民间工业史》打破了这两个历史叙事之间的藩篱。在此之前，林教授最知名的著作是《施剑翘复仇案：民国时期公众同情的兴起与影响》。这部现代中国情感史的开创性作品在2007年获得了美国历史学会的费正清奖。《美妆帝国蝴蝶牌》延续了《施剑翘复仇案》的“微观史”角度，但题旨更宏大。林郁沁通过对陈蝶仙及其事业相关史料的细读，发掘了一位隐藏在鸳鸯蝴蝶派掌门人背后的成功企业家和知识传播者。林教授进一步以陈蝶仙从知名作家到工业大亨的经历为依据，提出了“民间工业主义”（vernacular industrialism）这个历史范畴。这本书围绕“民间工业主义”的讨论跳出了“发明-制造-扩散”的叙事窠臼，勾勒出一部从仿制、在地化到再仿制的去中心化的全球工业史。陈蝶仙正是一位善于利用自身优势和本地资源的仿制高手。这既是一部围绕着陈蝶仙的微观史，也是一次将文化史、科技史、经济史和经营史融为一炉的成功尝试。在《上海书评》的访谈中，林教授重点回顾了她是如何通过发掘陈蝶仙的故事来挑战传统历史叙事的。

《美妆帝国蝴蝶牌：一部近代中国民间工业史》，[美]林郁沁著，陶磊译，上海人民出版社|光启书局2023年6月出版，332页，89.00元

 I'm building a pc for gaming and schoolwork.
 I would like to know what I should use.
 there aren't a lot of games I want to play that aren't supported on Linux.
 on the other hand, Microsoft PowerPoint is a must-have (or something like that).
 I also make little games in my free time.
 also, I don't really know what distro to use.
 that's pretty much all!

只要对游戏玩家们提到 “Denuvo” 这个名字，相信就能立即看到他们强烈的反应。关于 Denuvo 的报道下面的评论是大量对他们的 DRM 反盗版技术的抱怨。该公司的电子游戏首席运营官在一次采访中强调，他认为 Denuvo 是整个游戏界的积极力量。他说：“反盗版技术对游戏发行商有利，（但也）对玩家有利，因为它保护了（发行商）的投资，这意味着发行商可以投资于下一个游戏。……无论人们是否愿意相信，我们都是游戏玩家，我们热爱游戏，我们热爱成为游戏的一部分，我们开发技术的目的是为了让这个行业变得更好、更强大。”

旧金山的抗议者用交通锥桶使自动驾驶出租车失效

在旧金山，一群反对自动驾驶出租车的人发现，他们可以通过在车辆的引擎盖上放置一个交通锥桶来禁用 Cruise 和 Waymo 自动驾驶出租车。该组织称这是一种抗议自动驾驶出租车服务在该市蔓延的形式，它似乎得到了居民的支持，他们对这些车辆的故障和阻塞交通感到厌烦。加州公用事业委员会计划于 7 月中旬批准扩大旧金山的自动驾驶出租车数量。

老王点评：这些交通锥桶“真正”发挥了阻挡汽车的作用，但是，真能阻挡自动驾驶技术的发展吗？

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[经过大约 16 年的演变，云计算已经成为一种几乎所有网民都在使用的技术。它可以作为一种服务，用于满足各类企业和消费者的需求。因此，在云计算中正在使用多种服务架构，旨在根据最新的需求来定制所需技术。本文就如今使用的所有服务架构，提供一份完全指南。


尽管在全球范围内建立互相协同的计算机网络的构想在 20 世纪 60 年代初就提出了，但直到 2006 年，谷歌的首席执行官 埃里克·施密特Eric Schmidt 在当时的背景下引入了“云计算cloud computing”一词，这种构想才成为一种正式的概念。

云计算可以简单理解为遍布于世界各地的远程服务器网络，通过互联网共享数据和协同工作，从而为企业和消费者提供服务。虽然这样的定义比较武断，但它包含了云计算背后的核心思想。促成这项技术发展的主要因素是对“数据粘性”的需求，就是令数据更容易被各种设备访问，同时也要减少数据丢失的风险。如果用户甲只在一台服务器上保存了数据，对于用户甲来说，只要有一台服务器中断，数据就很有可能永久性丢失。这种做法无异于“把所有鸡蛋放在同一个篮子里”，从来都不是一个好办法，特别是当你在处理对公司和消费者具有重要意义的数据时。但如果你在多台服务器上备份了用户甲的数据，将有两个主要好处：其一，即使一台服务器中断，用户甲仍然可以正常获取数据；其二，云服务可以从负荷最小的、离他最近的那台正常运作的服务器获取数据。这使用户甲可以在不同设备上更快、更容易地获取数据。

历经大约 16 年的发展，云计算从起初只是一种用于备份图片的工具，变为了互联网的骨干。如今几乎所有的应用，从 Office 到 Asana 以及 Todolist，都利用云计算来实现实时访问和数据共享。几乎任意一款你能想像到的应用都在使用云计算。从 Gmail 和 YouTube，到Instagram，一切都使用云计算，以提供快速、便捷、可…]]></summary>

I thought this might be problem in mint but i asked one of friend who has ubuntu , blud has also 8gb and an 256gb ssd too but says he has this system freezing problem too!!!. Seems like linux makes your system faster is just a myth to me now , it is more slower actually.

No matter if i use free fonts or copy Windows fonts, use slight or full hinting, use grayscale or RGBA hinting, it still sucks. Some fonts are better rendered than other, but generally it's nowhere near to ClearType. I simply cannon browse the web in linux for prolonged time without eye fatigue or even small head pain. I am using linux like 20 years, things are getting better in many ways but font rendering is somehow stagnating. Is Hi-DPI ultimate solution? Should i abandon standard DPI displays and rather go with 200% DPI? What are your opinions on this topic?

 When I run `sudo libinput list-devices` I get the response `sudo: libinput: command not found`.
 If I don't have libinput, what do I have? How can I found out what my distro is using instead?
 Is there any way that a good book can guide me through the debian in deepth?

It worked fine for 2-3 days then my brother messed up something & I simply first deleted the GRUB for Ubuntu using 'bcdedit delete' command & then cleared the disks in order to delete Ubuntu from my system.
 But when I was re-installing it showed my where it asks like where do I need to install, it showed me like 'Install alongside other OS' but when the first time I tried dual-boot it was just like 'Install alongside Windows 10'. So, it shows the previous OS doesn't remove 100%. That didn't a problem anyways, I simply re-installed it and it's working fine now since then.
 But now I want to install it on my SSD & HDD to utilize my SSD. Now, it's installed on my HDD which kinda sucks, it literally takes 4-5 min to boot. So, thinking to re-install it again.
 So, like is it ok to perform that many re-installations? Doesn't it affect my system performance? Also, is there any more efficient way to remove Linux properly than I opt previously?
 Any help is appreciated, thanks!

有一类人的生活状态是这样的：每天清晨闹钟响前已经醒来，假日就算关了闹钟也无法睡到自然醒；还没起床就在手机上查工作邮件，睡觉之前也要回复了工作邮件才安心；上班时忙着处理各种事情，水不敢喝怕上厕所，但咖啡提神还是要灌几杯下肚；病了不敢请假，不舒服只能吃止痛药缓解；吃饭狼吞虎咽风卷残云几分钟搞定；下班路上不断刷社交媒体生怕遗漏各种新闻动态；擅长多任务处理（multitasking），但五分钟全心全意都没法给生命中最重要的人；一停步就觉得对不起全世界，想休息又觉得自己不值得；虽然新年愿望是躺平躺赢，但好不容易做完手上一件事之后，又开始计划下一件，心中窃喜：忙完这一阵，又可以忙下一阵了！
美国著名记者、公共演讲家、美国公共电视网（PBS）主持瑟列丝特·海德利（Celeste Headlee）2020年出版的畅销书《失控的努力文化》开头描写的就是过度工作、做得太多、活得太少的现代社会芸芸众生：
周日晚上我们还在回复工作邮件。我们不停阅读各种文章希望找到提升脑力增加效率的方法。我们把自己的照片剪切妥当用上滤镜才发上社交媒体让大家赞好。看到有趣的文章我们也只读最前面的几段，因为根本没时间看完。我们加班加点超时工作，压力山大，总是不满，不断追求越来越高的目标。我们是效率邪教的成员，我们正用生产力来杀害自己。
 “效率邪教组织”（the cult of efficiency）的说法来自英国哲学家罗素。此书导言首先引用了罗素散文《赞美闲暇》（In Praise of Idleness）中的这段话：
有人会这样说，稍事闲暇虽然令人愉悦，但如果人们每天二十…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[this. might sound incredibly stupid but Linus gave a talk many years ago and discussed that he doesn't like fooling around with Linux and is much more interested in the kernel and not much else. he brought up that he reinstalls his OS a couple times a year. I'm really just curious how easy it is to maintain all your settings and files by doing this. I guess it could work easily in the cloud as all your data syncs there and you can access it from any device. but he gave this talk before the cloud was as big as it is now. so did he imply that he just stored all his files on an external drive/network and he goes in once a month or once a quarter and nukes his machine and reinstalls from scratch? I'm pretty new to linux but I want to make sure I understand the file structure. thanks in advance.

 So what would you do if this suddenly happened? Have you thought about an alternative? If so, what is it and why?
 As a somewhat separate question, I'm also curious to know if you guys think we could make FreeBSD just as usable as Linux if enough people moved to it. Wouldn't that solve a lot of the issues that we have in our community? Such as having to make different binaries for different distros and so on?
 Curious to hear your thoughts!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[近期，金融管理部门对蚂蚁集团及旗下机构处以罚款（含没收违法所得）71.23亿元，要求蚂蚁集团关停违规开展的“相互宝”业务，并依法补偿消费者利益。


消息称，近年来，金融管理部门坚持发展和规范并重，建立健全平台经济治理体系，出台一系列制度办法，初步形成平台企业金融业务发展与监管制度框架，促进平台经济规范健康发展。2020年11月以来，从依法加强监管和有效防范风险的角度出发，金融管理部门督促指导蚂蚁集团、腾讯集团等大型平台企业全面整改金融活动中存在的违法违规问题。目前，平台企业金融业务存在的大部分突出问题已完成整改。金融管理部门工作重点从推动平台企业金融业务的集中整改转入常态化监管。


近期，针对蚂蚁集团及旗下机构过往年度在公司治理、金融消费者保护、参与银行保险机构业务活动、从事支付结算业务、履行反洗钱义务和开展基金销售业务等方面存在的违法违规行为，金融管理部门依据《中国人民银行法》《反洗钱法》《银行业监督管理法》《保险法》《证券投资基金法》《消费者权益保护法》等，对蚂蚁集团及旗下机构处以罚款（含没收违法所得）71.23亿元。要求蚂蚁集团关停违规开展的“相互宝”业务，并依法补偿消费者利益。此外，针对以往执法检查中发现的问题，金融管理部门近期也对邮储银行、平安银行、人保财险和财付通公司等实施了行政处罚。


7月7日，国家金融监督管理总局网站发布行政处罚信息公开表，对蚂蚁科技集团股份有限公司(下称蚂蚁科技集团)罚没合计超37亿元。


罚单显示，蚂蚁科技集团主要违法违规事实有两条：


一是侵害消费者合法权益。包括：存在引人误解的金融营销宣传行为，侵害消费者知情权；未向部分客户群体明示还款要求；未按规定处理部分消费者个人信息。


二是违规参与银行保险机构业务活动。包括：违规参与保险代理、保险经纪业务；违规参与销售个人养老保障管理产品、银行理财产品、互联网存款产品。


根据《中华人民共和国银行业监督管理法》第十九条、第四十四条，《中华人民共和国保险法》第六条、第一百一十九条、第一百五十九条，《中华人民共和国消费者权益保护法》第十四条、第十六条、第二十条、第二十六条、第二十九条、第五十六条等规定，国家金融监督管理总局决定，对蚂蚁科技集团没收违法所得112977.62万元，罚款263270.44万元，罚没合计376248.06万元。


作出处罚决定的日期为2023年7月7日。


蚂蚁集团回应被罚71.23亿元：自2020年以来，蚂蚁集团在金融管理部门指导下积极推进各项整改，目前已完成相关整改事项。今天，蚂蚁集团收到金融管理部门行政处罚决定书，我们对此诚恳接受、坚决服从，并将进一步夯实合规治理水平。未来，蚂蚁集团将恪守使命与初心，坚持守正创新，继续增强科技研发能力，努力为实体经济尤其是小微群体做好服务并创造更大价值。]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Long story short, steam will stop working with windows 7. So I will be giving linux a try.
 I don't know anything about it. But life is about learning new things.
 From the very short research Iv'e done, I think I will be going with the arch based system Manjaro.
 A couple questions.
 What do I need to know before I wipe my drive and make the journey to rebuilding my os.
 Is it similar to formatting a hard drive and installing a windows os? Just use a flashdrive with Manjaro?
 I only have 1 hard drive at the moment.
  
Drivers.
  
Should I have at least my ethernet drivers loaded onto a flash drive ready to go? I remember last time with a windows install I didn't have them, and had to use another computer to aqquir them and load them in.
 Does the os have features that locate drivers automaticly? Or do I have to search them manually?
  
I have 32 gigs of ram. and windows 7 locked away 16 gigs because it wasn't the premium edition. Will linux free my ram and allow me to use it as intended?
  
Anything else a first time user should know off the bat?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello,
 I find myself questioning whether using GUI is actually a good thing. I've seen people online making videos about how tiling window managers are undermining your productivity, and that things like it are just a distraction. A regular person is/should incapable of multitasking when they are focussed on let's say, programming.
 There's further discussions to be had about stripping any shell/terminal of syntax highlighting, as well as code syntax highlighting, and having everything be the same color.
 I'm mainly concerned with this as I am trying to find a way to use linux to train myself to become a better programmer, and to function in a development environment where GUIless is the standard.
 Another frequent problem is that GUI adjacent stuff always sparks a lot of conversation and I want to ideally have an environment that is as neutral and unexpressive as possible, because I don't want any slight hint of expression of personality ruining my job prospects. For this reason I always stick to default color themes and fonts, because these choices were made for me, and therefore by not changing them I am not expressing any opinion. My job is to do my job.
 How is this looked upon in industries where people use linux distros in production? I really need to commit to something that is objectively as non-offensive as possible. I do not want to get yelled at.
 I hope someone can share some insight, and recommend a distro that's focussed on GUIless, probably.

to live up to its early hype,
this Digital
Antiquarian article covers the history of rogue-like games in great
detail.


	This brings us back around to a statement I made at the outset:
	that roguelikes are the exception that proves the rule of
	open-source game development — and just possibly of open-source
	software development in general. The cast of thousands who
	contribute to them do so in order to make exactly the games that
	they want to play, which in the abstract is the best of all
	possible reasons to make a game. The experience they end up with
	is, unsurprisingly, much like high-wire programming at its most
	advanced, presenting players with an immense, multi-faceted system
	to be explored and mastered.]]></summary>

So I think that Steam might drop Windows support in favour of Linux if that happened.
 Do you think any other apps or games would drop Windows support in favour of Linux? Or do you think the rest would just take the loss and pay Microsoft a cut of their revenue?

mechanisms to take care of work that cannot be done immediately.  For many
(or most) needs, the workqueue
subsystem is the tool that developers reach for first.  Workqueues
took their current form over a dozen years
ago, but that does not mean that there are not improvements to be made.
Two sets of patches from Tejun Heo show the pressures being felt by the
workqueue subsystem and the solutions that are being tried — with varying
degrees of success.]]></summary>

 I have a bunch of older thin clients that have a 2GB storage and want to find a dist that I can use to install that has RDP or browser support so we can give this hardware new life. we have a few hundred of these thin clients and want to make use of them again. 
 i suppose another way might be PXE now that i think about it. though i ll have to check if they have PXE support or a small EFI or Micro OS to proxy the PXE support. 
 Any ideas to whats out there that could solve this? i like the rdp client in ubuntu but ubu requires more than 2gb storage to install.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[5G 并没有影响飞行安全

2021 年末，就在 Verizon 计划在其持有的新 C 波段频谱上开通 5G 网络之前，美国航空业开展了一场大型公关活动，以 阻止 该网络的推出。航空业认为 5G 频段会对飞机上的高度计形成“重大干扰”，这种高度计对于飞机在雨天和其他可能影响能见度的情况下安全着陆至关重要。一些国际航空公司开始 减少 飞往美国的航班，航空业认为这甚至会导致“国家的商业陷入停滞”。这场对峙在去年夏天达到了高峰。经过公开的辩论后，Verizon 和 AT&T 同意将他们在一些机场附近的 5G 推广工作推迟到 7 月 1 日，以使航空业有时间将一些飞机高度计更新为不会受到 5G 影响的高度计。而到了最后期限 7 月 1 日，仅达美航空就预计约还有 190 架飞机需要加装新高度计。但这一天就这样悄然过去了，一家航班追踪公司称并没有发生“任何专门与 5G 有关的干扰”。

老王点评：所以，飞机上使用手机影响飞行安全吗？




法官裁定表情符号 👍 表示签署合同

一位谷物买家在 2021 年 3 月向一位农民发送了一条短信，称该公司希望购买 86 吨亚麻，在秋季交付。双方后来通了电话，买家发来一张 11 月交付亚麻的合同图片，还说 “请确认亚麻合同”。这位农民发回了一个竖起大拇指（👍）的表情符号。但当 11 月到来时，亚麻并没有交付，而且价格已经上涨。一位加拿大法官说，“（竖起大拇指）表情符号是一种非传统的文件‘签名’方式，但在这种情况下，这是一种传达‘签名’的两个目的的有效方式”，因此裁定农民违反了合同，并命令农民支付超过 82,000 美元违约金。农民辩称，这个表情符号只表明他在短信中收到了合同。

Threads 不到 24 小时内突破 3000 万注册用户

Meta 的新 Twitter 竞争对手 Threads 在 AppStore 上线的头两个小时就超过了 200 万注册人数，并且没有放缓的迹象。在前 7 个小时突破 1000 万注册人数后，又在不到 24 小时内达到 3000 万注册人数。Threads 现在也是最快突破 100 万用户大关的应用，打破了 ChatGPT 的记录。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[据北京市市场监督管理局网站，因违反《中华人民共和国广告法》第八条第一款，苹果电子产品商贸(北京)有限公司被罚款3万元，处罚机关为北京市东城区市场监督管理局。这是该公司今年收到的第三张罚单，处罚依据均为广告法相关规定，三次罚款总额达到33万。


北京市市场监督管理局披露的处罚详情显示，苹果“iPhone年年焕新计划”主页页面为其推出的iPhone年年焕新计划发布广告。广告中有“升级到新款iPhone，轻轻松松”“如欲加入iPhone年年焕新计划，只需购买指定新款iPhone，并在同一笔交易中加购AppleCare+服务计划，即可加入其中”等内容。 经调查，年年焕新计划为苹果推出的可升级iPhone，并提供AppleCare+服务的保障计划。在实际执行中，iPhone年年焕新计划不可与商务折扣同享。苹果将上述限制条件写于跳转页面的“参与iPhone年年焕新计划，你即同意下述条款与条件”条款中，未在上述主页广告中予以标明。 上述广告内容由苹果自行编辑制作及上传发布，可追溯的发布日期为2020年10月23日。2021年8月底，苹果对上述内容予以修改完善。


在这张罚单之前，苹果电子产品商贸(北京)有限公司在5月份连续收到了两张罚单。


5月4日，苹果电子产品商贸(北京)有限公司因违反《中华人民共和国反不正当竞争法》第九条第一款被罚10万，此次处罚涉及到的产品是Apple watch series3(蜂窝网络版)手表。


处罚详情显示，2017年9月当事人在其官方网站宣传其销售的Apple watch series3(蜂窝网络版)手表产品的内置蜂窝网络功能时宣称“支持的运营商 中国移动今年稍后推出 中国电信今年稍后推出 中国联通今年稍后推出”。2017年12月13日因通信运营商未能为当事人销售的Apple watch series3(蜂窝网络版)手表产品的内置蜂窝网络功能提供技术支持，当事人将蜂窝网络服务推出的时间由“今年稍后推出”改为“2018年推出”。 当事人销售的Apple watch series3(蜂窝网络版)手表产品的“内置蜂窝网络功能”必须在通信运营商的技术支持下才可以使用。当事人与中国移动、中国联通、中国电信三家通信运营商签订的相关协议中并未约定运营商为其销售的Apple watch series3(蜂窝网络版)手表产品内置蜂窝网络服务提供技术支持的具体时间;根据当事人提交的上述合同，三家通信运营商仅向当事人承诺了其与其他客户的同等权利。 当事人称根据其与该三家通信运营商的协议以及定期沟通作出“合理的商业预计”即三家运营商应于2017年为当事人销售的Apple watch series3的内置蜂窝网络功能提供支持，将“今年稍后推出”的内容在其官方网站对外进行宣传。当事人在2017年12月13日又因“运营商无法实现我们在官网上所预测的服务开通时间后，我们及时更新了官网信息”，将上述宣传介绍内容改为“2018年推出”。 结合所取得的证据，我局认定当事人的上述宣传介绍内容没有依据。当事人上述使用没有依据的“合理的商业预期”对外进行宣传的行为引发消费者举报。


5月24日，苹果电子产品商贸(北京)有限公司因为违反《中华人民共和国广告法》(2018)第五十五条第一款被处罚20万元，这次涉及到的产品是Macbook Air。


处罚详情显示，2022年2月14日，执法人员依据举报线索浏览当事人上述网站，发现其通过上述网站为其销售的Macbook Air产品发布广告，广告使用了“8核中央处理器 干活够爽快，用电省得狠。”“M1芯片拥有我们迄今打造的最快的中央处理器。”等内容，并在页面右上角有“<广告>”字样。实际上，案发时M1芯片配备的中央处理器并非为苹果公司打造的最快的。该公司在配备M1芯片的Macbook Air和配备M1 Pro和M1 Max芯片的MacBook Pro同时销售的情况下，在Macbook Air产品广告中宣称其搭载的M1芯片“拥有我们迄今打造的最快的中央处理器。”内容与事实不符。 上述广告内容由当事人自行编辑制作及上传发布，广告费用无法核算。

《驶向现代性：私家车与当代中国的中产阶级》是一本极其迷人的有关汽车与中产阶级关联的社会科学专著，用作者的表述是机动车机制与中产的交叉点。理解机动车机制成为这本书构建中产叙事的关键。二十二万字描述聚焦机动车机制的中产叙事，围绕社会、家庭、轿车市场、素质话语、车牌拍卖和泊车这六个方面，实现中产阶级的具体化。《驶向现代化》提出机动车机制（automotive regime）这一核心概念，强调automobile（汽车）并不都是流动的，它是社会与技术二者聚合的产物，囊括了“人类、机械、空间（包括道路及其他）、代理人、监管机构，还有大量的相关行业及基础设施要素”。
我曾经在《民俗研究》发表过一篇文章（《中产阶层“不可统计”的生活经验——民族志书写城市的新路径和可能性》，2018年第6期），探讨中产阶级经验研究的成就和动态。我将这些经验研究分为三个类别：一、产权、空间的私有化，二、自我管理与规训，三、母职、照料与教育。这样的分类虽然尽可能涵盖中产阶级田野调查涉及的不同方面，不过有一个问题是仍旧将作为生活方式的中产阶级经验放在相互区别的主题单元，而割裂了生活方式的整体性。那时我还没有了解到张珺的汽车研究，虽然了解姗姗来迟，不过我会毫不犹豫地将《驶向现代化》串联起这三个分类，依靠机动车机制，它将产权、空间、素质话语与母职等多重经验维度串联起来、带动起来，这种贯通和整合效应接近机动车体制的含义。作者用汽车贯穿三大分类框架的做法，也让我回想起研究生同学因为带孩子不定期去医院打针而痛下决心学车，购买第二辆车，这样她就可以不用麻烦丈夫，自己开车带孩子“履行母职”。
由汽车引发的多重体制触角的碰撞并非均是井然有序的，有即兴性和滞后性的成分，即突发情况发生之后的管理反应。…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[我们评测了最新的 SparkyLinux 7 “Orion Belt”，它带来了最新、最好的 Debian 12 软件包。


SparkyLinux 是著名的基于 Debian 的桌面 Linux 发行版，又推出了它的最新版本 SparkyLinux 7 “Orion Belt”。自 SparkyLinux 6.0 以来，经过近两年的开发，这个主要版本已经发布。这个备受期待的版本结合了 Debian 12 的稳定性优势和 SparkyLinux 的尖端功能，承诺提供卓越的用户体验。

让我们深入研究这个主要版本的细节，并了解它的性能和其他发行版方面。

SparkyLinux 7 “Orion Belt”

核心更新

SparkyLinux 以其多样化的桌面风格而脱颖而出，确保适合每个用户。无论你喜欢视觉上令人惊叹的 KDE Plasma、轻量级 LXQt、经典 MATE、可定制的 Xfce 还是简约的 Openbox，SparkyLinux 7 都提供了令人印象深刻的选择，以满足各种喜好和要求。

SparkyLinux 7 的核心是 Debian 12 “Bookworm”，为稳定性和可靠性提供了坚实的基础。Debian 12 几天前发布，作为该项目的一个重要里程碑，它是历史上最好的 Debian 版本之一。也就是说，在 SparkyLinux 7 中，用户可以期望从 Debian “Bookworm” 和 Sparky “Orion Belt” 仓库更新所有软件包，确保最新的软件版本随时可用。

此版本默认由 Linux 内核 6.1 LTS 提供支持。但是，如果你更喜欢前沿的主线内核，那么你可以在不稳定的仓库中获取 6.3 和 5.15 LTS。



增强的应用和软件

内置应用堆栈已更新，包括基本应用。你可以使用稳定的 Firefox 102.12 ESR、Thunderbird 102.12、VLC 3.0 和 LibreOffice 7.4 作为关键应用。如果你更喜欢最新的 Firefox，那么可以使用 Firefox 114，它可以在单独的 Sparky 仓库中找到。

Sparky APTus AppCenter 是一款用于管理软件安装和更新的集成工具，已更新至版本 20230530，增强了用户的便利性。在一项重大更改中，systemd-timesyncd 取代了 ntp 以简化时间同步。

SparkyLinux 的旗舰产品 Xfce 桌面版本为 4.18，这是这款轻量级桌面的最新更新版本。此外，你还可以找到其他版本，例如 KDE Plasma 5.27、LXQt 1.2 和 MATE 1.26。

该团队还投入了大量精力来改进 amd64 ISO 映像，使其能够在具有 UEFI 主板和启用安全启动的机器上启动，从而扩展了对现代系统的兼容性。

那么，关于这个版本的更新就到这里了。我们来看看性能吧。



安装和性能

我使用 SparkyLinux Xfce 版本进行了本次评测的测试。Calamares 3.2.61 的安装很顺利，没有任何错误。如果你正在安装，你应该注意立付live介质的密码是 “live”，这是启动安装程序所必需的。

所有更新脚本（包括欢迎应用）在安装后运行良好。欢迎程序可让你快速访问所有系统信息和桌面功能。

我通过 Firefox（运行 YouTube 的 4 个以上选项卡）、文件管理器、绘图应用、终端、VLC、Synaptic 包管理器和 AppCenter 来运行这个版本。资源占用稍高一些。

此负载的内存消耗约为 2 GB，CPU 使用率平均约为 2%。SparkyLinux 7（Xfce）默认安装占用 5.2 GB 磁盘空间。

所以，总的来说，我相信它运行得相当好，但考虑到 Xfce 桌面，内存消耗似乎有点高。



总结

SparkyLinux 7 “Orion Belt” 带来了 Debian 的精华，为用户提供稳定性和多功能性的平衡组合。SparkyLinux 凭借其广泛的桌面风格、精选应用和专业版本，可以满足广泛的用户需求。

该版本将持续近两年的维护和安全更新。因此，你可以放心地采用它作为你的日常使用。

你可以从其 官方网站 下载 SparkyLinux。

Fedora 40 change proposal to add limited, opt-out telemetry to the
workstation edition.  The proposal is detailed; it is clear that the
developers involved understand that this will be a hard sell in that
community.


	We believe an open source community can ethically collect limited
	aggregate data on how its software is used without involving big
	data companies or building creepy tracking profiles that are not in
	the best interests of users. Users will have the option to disable
	data upload before any data is sent for the first time. Our service
	will be operated by Fedora on Fedora infrastructure, and will not
	depend on Google Analytics or any other controversial third-party
	services. And in contrast to proprietary software operating
	systems, you can redirect the data collection to your own private
	metrics server instead of Fedora's to see precisely what data is
	being collected from you, because the server components are open

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Greetings, I am an extreme noob with only enough knowledge to be dangerous. I followed a guide to install and run Foundry VTT on my Amazon EC2 instance and it's worked for years, recently updated to latest version and I'm unable to resolve the following issue I get when trying to access the foundry vtt server file directly.
 /foundry/foundryvtt: error while loading shared libraries: libatk-1.0.so.0: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory 
 All I'm doing is typing /foundry/foundryvtt into my console and getting that error, I assume that means I'm trying to start it.
 I've tried installing the library / package it refers to using sudo yum install libatk-1.0.so.0 and get 
 Loaded plugins: extras_suggestions, langpacks, priorities, update-motd amzn2-core | 3.7 kB 00:00:00 Package atk-2.22.0-3.amzn2.0.2.i686 already installed and latest version Nothing to do 
 Not sure what to do to resolve. I've far exhausted my ability to google lol. Any help would be appreciated!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'd like to use Posix message queues for inter-process communication between some of my user desktop programs. I think it would be a better solution that sockets, for a few reasons, but the problem I am currently facing is that it appears that only root can create the queues, and that might be a show-stopper for me.
 My code is basically: 
 struct mq_attr attr; attr.mq_curmsgs = 0; attr.mq_maxmsg = 2; attr.mq_msgsize = 1024; attr.mq_flags = 0; oflag = O_RDONLY; /* Open the queue, and create it if the sending process hasn't * already created it. */ mqfd = mq_open( "/test_queue", oflag, 0777, &attr ); if (mqfd == -1) { perror("mq_open failure from main"); exit(0); }; 
 But when I run it as a user, I get:
 "mq_open failure from main: Permission denied" 
 I just read the man pages for mq_open and for mq_overview and I didn't notice an explanation for this, does anyone have experience with Posix message queues on Linux?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello guys. I was looking for a notes app on Linux. I found out Standard Notes, but I checked on their website and there are 2 versions: free very limited and paid with all features. Since it's open source, how is it possible to be paid? If I build it myself from the source code, will I could get all the features for free or I still have to pay. I'm new in programming. I don't need their cloud, because, at the moment, I'm looking only for offline features. In the feature, I'd like to use it with sync services on Android, but I could use google drive (since the app saves notes in encrypted format).
 Thanks in advance

I have about 1.5GB of free space in my home directory, but it shouldn't matter since I was sending the ISO to an external drive.

 Edit: I am using Chrome to download such file, but it also happens with Firefox.

 I got in a (very brief) argument with a friend on whether it's worth learning PERL since there's Python. I couldn't make a good argument other than: PERL was designed for text processing so it's good at it, because I haven't and don't use PERL.
 As a sysadmin or otherwise, under what conditions would you pick PERL over Python, assuming you're adept at both?

 Sometimes you encounter files generated in Windows like a bolt out of the blue.
 '--universal-newline' of pyvipe might save you.
 Check the video here: https://www.reddit.com/r/coolgithubprojects/comments/14scz7k/pyvipe_020_unique_option_universalnewline/
 repo: https://github.com/Constantin1489/pyvipe
 install: `pip install pyvipe`
 command: `vipe`
 ​
 The original vipe of moreutils is already perfect! I recommend moreutils. It has been a trusted tool for a long time.
 But if you need vipe but you have GNU parallel, also are annoyed to remove moreutils parallel symlink and add a symlink to GNU's again, OR you need to use it temporarily, OR any restriction in your environment but pip or python are allowed, then copy pyvipe script or install pyvipe.
 Or if you are annoyed with installing `dnf --enablerepo=crb install perl-IPC-Run` before installing vipe of moreutils, use mine.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[ChatGPT 流量 6 月首次出现月度下滑

去年 11 月推出的 ChatGPT，其网站的月流量和独立访客在 6 月首次出现下降。ChatGPT 网站的全球桌面和移动流量比 5 月份下降了 9.7%，独立访客下降了 5.7%，访客在网站上花费的时间也下降了 8.5%。ChatGPT 在推出两个月后，达到了 1 亿月度活跃用户。它是有史以来增长最快的消费者应用程序，现在拥有超过 15 亿的月访问量，是世界上排名前 20 的网站之一。


消息来源：路透社



老王点评：看来 ChatGPT 的热度有点下降了，除非能在不久推出 GPT-5 —— 前一段时间有谣传 OpenAI 已经训练了 GPT-5，我对此是保持高度怀疑的。




英国的大学制定了关于生成性人工智能的指导原则

24 所罗素集团研究密集型大学的副校长们已经签署了一套指导原则，以确保学生和教职员工都具备人工智能知识。他们说这将有助于大学利用人工智能的机会，同时保护高等教育的学术严谨性和完整性。指导意见中说，应该教学生在学习中适当地使用人工智能，同时也让他们意识到生成性人工智能中存在的抄袭、偏见和不准确的风险。工作人员也必须接受培训，以便他们有能力帮助学生。


消息来源：卫报



老王点评：这是一种务实的态度，毕竟已经不可阻挡，那就要学会如何与之相处。




Spotify 停止接受苹果应用商店支付

Spotify 通知其付费用户，“不再接受这种计费方式作为付款形式”。用户需要在上一个订阅期结束后，重新使用 Spotify 的高级订阅。由于苹果拿走了 30% 的应用内购买的费用，与直接通过 Spotify 订阅相比，通过应用内购买订阅的 Spotify 用户每月被额外收取 3 美元。尽管现在苹果公司在第一年后将订阅的佣金率降低到 15%。

I've used this before, but I forgot how to do it exactly. For example you can do docker ps X and this will not stop once the containers are listed, but will continue to display and it will refresh. And X is the thing that I am looking for. I think it was universal and you could also do for example ls X or git status, very similar to how tail -f works. If someone knows how this can be done it will be very helpful. Thanks

在 介绍 pdftk-java 中, 我展示了如何在脚本中使用 pdftk-java 来快速修改 PDF 文件。

但是，pdftk-java 最有用的场景是处理那种动辄几百页的没有目录的大 PDF 文件。这里所谓的目录不是指文档前面供打印的目录，而是指显示在 PDF 阅读器侧边栏里的目录，它在 PDF 格式中的正式叫法是“书签bookmarks”。



如果没有书签，就只能通过上下滚动或全局搜索文本来定位想要的章节，这非常麻烦。

PDF 文件的另一个恼人的小问题是缺乏元数据，比如标题和作者。如果你打开过一个标题栏上显示类似 “Microsoft Word - 04_Classics_Revisited.docx” 的 PDF 文件，你就能体会那种感觉了。

pdftk-java 让我能够创建自己的书签，我再也不面对这些问题了。

在 Linux 上安装 pdftk-java

正如 pdftk-java 的名称所示的，它是用 Java 编写的。它能够在所有主流操作系统上运行，只要你安装了 Java。

Linux 和 macOS 用户可以从 AdoptOpenJDK.net 安装 Java（LCTT 译注：原文为 Linux，应为笔误）。

Windows 用户可以安装 Red Hat's Windows build of OpenJDK。

在 Linux 上安装 pdftk-java：


从 Gitlab 仓库下载 pdftk-all.jar release，保存至 ~/.local/bin/ 或 其它路径 下.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Meta公司的新社交软件Threads已登陆美国苹果应用程序商店，这款社交应用预计将于7月6日正式发布，其与马斯克旗下的推特（Twitter）软件非常相似。


据美国有线电视新闻网（CNN）7月4日报道，Meta公司创始人兼首席执行官扎克伯格，坐拥Facebook和Instagram两款社交软件，其公司预告了一款新的应用程序Threads，该软件将通过提供一个可在线实时对话的平台来与推特竞争。根据苹果应用程序商店的列表，它预计将于7月6日正式上线。根据苹果商店的描述，该应用似乎与推特有许多相似之处。


“Threads是一个可以与他人一起讨论从你今天关心的主题到明天的趋势以及所有其他事情的社区。”上述描述写道，“无论你对什么感兴趣，你都可以关注并直接与你最喜欢的创作者和其他喜欢同样事物的人联系——或者建立自己的忠实追随者群体，与世界分享你的想法、观点和创造力。”


Meta公司在近日发布Threads这一新软件的决定，可能受推特在7月初出现故障的影响，推特在故障结束后宣布对其用户能够阅读的推文数量进行了临时限制。马斯克说，这些限制是为了 "解决极端程度的数据搜刮和系统操纵"。


马斯克7月3日在推特上评论了Threads，他说： "谢天谢地，他们的运作是如此理智。“自2022年10月入主推特以来，马斯克对推特的运作方式进行了巨大的改动，他现在正在寻找让该平台恢复增长的方法。推特于7月3日宣布，用户很快需要为TweetDeck付费，这是一个可以让人们管理关注的账户的工具。


另一边，推特也在试图蚕食Meta的领域。今年5月，推特增加了加密信息功能，并表示后续将推出通话功能，这些发展可能使该平台与同样属于Meta的Facebook Messenger和WhatsApp竞争。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The kernel thread “inet_frag_wq” is created using a workqueue (https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v6.2-rc1/source/net/ipv4/inet_fragment.c#L211), we could have guessed it based on a workqueue do to the “wq” suffix. It is used for fragment management of IP packets. Thus the goal of “inet_frag_wq” is to reassemble fragmented IPv4/IPv6 packets (https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v6.2-rc1/source/net/ipv4/inet_fragment.c#L6).
 Overall, the goal of IP fragmentation is to split packets into smaller chunks in order to allow them to meet the MTU (Maximum Transmission Unit) requirement of a specific network. There is an implementation difference between IP fragmentation in IPv4 and IPv6. On IPv4 the information needed for fragmentation is part of the IPv4 header which in IPv6 there is a specific “Fragmentation Header” (https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/ipv6-fragmentation-header/). An illustration of the flow is shown in the diagram below both for IPv4 and IPv6.
 Thus, “inet_frag_wq” is relevant when a fragmented IP packet arrives at a specific system. The OS stores the fragmented packets in a queue and reassembles them before they are passing the data to the upper layers of the network stack. The fragment queue is represented by "struct inet_frag_queue" (https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v6.2-rc1/source/include/net/inet_frag.h#L66). 
 Moreover, we can see in the source code the function “ip_frag_reasm” which is responsible for building a new IP datagram from all of its fragments (https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v6.2-rc1/source/net/ipv4/ip_fragment.c#L411).

阿克塞尔·霍耐特（Axel Honneth，1949-）是著名德国社会哲学家，被誉为法兰克福学派“第三代”最重要的理论家，他的著作对中国读者来说也并不陌生。多年前读过他的《为承认而斗争》（Kampf um Anerkennung，1985；胡继华译，上海人民出版社，2005年），当时想到的是在我们的思想启蒙历程中，对于在个体经验中人的自信、道德尊严和自我实现的希望究竟是如何被摧毁、被蔑视的。这个重要问题仍然没有在社会理论研究中受到应有的重视，因此在读到霍耐特从青年黑格尔的承认理论发展出他的“为承认而斗争”的时候确有一种震撼之感。但是对于霍耐特从规范性范畴出发建构爱、法律和共同体意识等三种承认模式，并且深信建立在道德基础上的承认模式与共同体的团结具有现实可能性，我的疑虑则从未消失。可能对于我们来说重要的不是观念史的从“认同”到“承认”的发展问题，而首先是“承认”作为一种在现实经验中如何能够被承认的问题；关于“承认”的观念性阐释的可能性与诱惑反而更凸显了在现实语境中的困惑性。但是无论如何，对于霍耐特在观念史与社会理论建构方面的穿透性阐释的能力是留下了深刻印象。 
近日读阿克塞尔·霍耐特的《时代的活体解剖：20世纪观念史肖像》（原书名Vivisektionen eines Zeitalters:Porträtes zur Ideenheschichte des 20Jahrhunderts，2014），有一种在观念史与个体经验及时代现实感之间紧密联系的感受，由此想到的是霍耐特的这个研究视角及其在论述中呈现的思想观念冲突对我们而言可能具有某种特殊的启发性和现实意义。霍耐特在该书中所选取的十一位理论家的共同点是“从20世纪的历史经验空间中获得理论创…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[小说家霍桑（1804-1864）是美国“黑暗浪漫主义”的代表人物，以《红字》《七角楼房》《福谷传奇》和《玉石雕像》等四大罗曼司闻名于世。此外，霍桑在短篇小说创作方面也卓有建树，有短篇“圣手”之美誉。他的短篇佳构多收录于《故事重述》（1837）、《古屋青苔》（1846）和《雪影》（1852）等三部故事集中，其中若干题材涉及巫术、变形以及万灵药水等超自然现象，无疑是对社会现实的扭曲反映。这类故事的主人公大多生性善良，不乏艺术天赋，但由于身处恶劣环境之中，往往难以逃脱悲剧性结局。同时代的小说家梅尔维尔曾评价霍桑隐居“古屋”（Old Manse）期间创作的短篇小说“笼罩在黑暗之中，因而分外黑暗”，并指明作家的本意并非神异其事，而是影射现实——从这个角度看，此类短篇皆可归为“寓言”。
《雪影》（The Snow-Image）取材于新英格兰普通家庭生活：家中两个孩子与雪花形成的雪孩一道在户外快乐玩耍，宽厚仁慈的父亲担心雪孩受冻，坚持将其带回家中炉前烘烤，雪孩立时化为一滩水渍。这是霍桑笔下最浅显的儿童寓言：作家一方面以清丽的笔触描绘自然景物，一方面讴歌人性之纯洁善良。然而，故事的结局却点明本文寓意所在：美国社会（及民众）最为推崇的务实精神与心灵世界格格不入——从一定意义上甚至可以说前者是后者的天敌。由于缺乏艺术的想象力和感知力，他们往往在无意之中扼杀美和艺术。
《海德格尔医生的实验》（Dr. Heidegger’s Experiment）同样是一则寓言。故事中的医生邀请五位老友，前来品尝他最新的科学发明——一种能让人返老还童的青春泉水。在场的所有人都信誓旦旦，保证重获青春后将开始崭新的生活。可当他们喝下泉水、如愿重回青春岁月后，立刻又恢复了旧时的恶习本性。最后，众人在一番抢夺中失手打碎水壶，于是一场美梦宣告破碎。这一故事体现了霍桑短篇一贯的主题，即“人性恶”无处不在：它可能在某些特定条件…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm in the process of trying to organize my tools and I'm looking for a tool tracking software I can use to keep track of what tools I have, and where I've put them. For example, I know I've got a pipe cutter, but I can't find it because the last time I used it I put it away in this toolbox instead of that one. The next time I go looking for the pipe cutter, I might spend an hour looking for it or just give up and borrow/buy a new one. This is in an effort to de-clutter and organize my work area(s). 
 I would prefer something other than a spreadsheet.
 Preferably I would like to be able to barcode label my stuff, so when I'm working on a project, I can scan the barcode, and it will tell me where I am supposed to put the tool away. Also, something that I can search "Screwdriver" and it will show me list of all my screwdrivers, where they are (or are at least supposed to be), and maybe have a picture.
 Most of the software programs/solutions I've been able to find are geared more towards business inventory that is to be sold/shipped/replenished/...etc. I don't need (or really want) a cloud solution, and I definitely don't want a subscription service - or really anything I have to pay for.
 Any suggestions? Anybody found a solution that works for them?
 Thanks!

 It's not that specific either, so... as long as your answer fits the question, it's good.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A couple of weeks ago I got a Sun Ultra 60 and I am having a lot of fun with it. I have installed Solaris 10 and I want to install Red Hat Linux 6.2 for Sparc. It installs the SILO bootloader but after installation it does not have an entry for Solaris 10. After a quick look it seems Solaris does not have the kernel in one file but many.
 Is it possible in Red Hat 6.2 to get its SILO bootloader to put to a Solaris kernel and boot it?

Right now is like 60 lines of Ruby using Nokogiri, but I will certainly look into it further down the line and improve the list.
There's a cronjob checking the thread every 12 hours but I will eventually shut that down and it will become static after that.
There are some really awesome blogs in there. I really recommend going through the list, it made my day.

 Admittedly I've been IT a long time, used linux on servers for a long time, and have generally been a Windows user for any GUI and office use.
 About a year ago, I bought a DELL Inspiron 15 3511 with Windows 10. I cared for it, upgraded software, and generally tried to keep it healthy. It was prone to blue-screens of death, horrible wifi connectivity issues, and handful of other nuisances. I upgraded to Win 11 and that was a trade up a little but the machine was unstable frequently enough that I was considering getting rid of the machine.
 Then, one day, the SSD on the machine outright dies. I didn't have a full backup so I decided to take the risk and install Ubuntu on the new SSD.
 I am delighted with the functionality under Ubuntu and Gnome, AND the stability of the machine has gone up to near perfect.
 Of course, everyone has difference experiences, but I wanted to share that you CAN win with using linux (Ubuntu) on a laptop over Windows... particularly for stability over Windows.
 Have a great day!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ruihan Li has disclosed
a significant vulnerability introduced into the 6.1 kernel:


	A flaw was found in the handling of stack expansion in the Linux
	kernel 6.1 through 6.4, aka "Stack Rot". The maple tree,
	responsible for managing virtual memory areas, can undergo node
	replacement without properly acquiring the MM write lock, leading
	to use-after-free issues. An unprivileged local user could use this
	flaw to compromise the kernel and escalate their privileges.

	As StackRot is a Linux kernel vulnerability found in the memory
	management subsystem, it affects almost all kernel configurations
	and requires minimal capabilities to trigger. However, it should be
	noted that maple nodes are freed using RCU callbacks, delaying the
	actual memory deallocation until after the RCU grace
	period. Consequently, exploiting this vulnerability is considered
	challenging.


The disclosure contains a detailed description of the problem.  Fixes have
been merged into the
mainline and the 6.4.1, 6.3.11, and 6.1.37
stable kernel updates.]]></summary>

美国国家安全分析人士警告说，中国的人工智能公司可能通过使用云服务绕过了现行的出口管制规则。这些服务允许客户获得强大的计算能力，而不需要购买控制清单上的先进设备 —— 包括芯片，如英伟达的 A100 芯片。美国政府正准备限制中国公司使用美国的云计算服务，要求亚马逊和微软等美国云服务提供商在向中国客户提供使用先进人工智能芯片的云计算服务之前，必须寻求美国政府的许可。


消息来源：华尔街日报



老王点评：又是一次重击。不过，没有先进芯片就无法制造 AI 么，未必。




Canonical 收回对 LXD 的控制

LXD 作为 Linux 容器（LXC）的开源容器管理扩展，长期以来一直与 Canonical 密切相关，是它的软件产品之一。之前，LXD 一直是 LXC 项目的一部分，但 Canonical 已经决定将其更多地拉入自己的直接控制范围。LXD 的 GitHub 资源库被转移到 Canonical 名下，其官网、YouTube 频道、论坛都也随之转移。LXC 社区对失去 LXD 表示遗憾。


消息来源：Phoronix



老王点评：越来越多的看到企业对开源暴露出了狼外婆的笑容。




最后一个支持 Windows 7/8 的 Firefox 版本发布

刚刚发布的 Firefox 115 是一个扩展支持版本（ESR），它将一直支持到 2024 年 9 月，之后不再提供安全更新。ESR 为许多下游项目提供了支持，如 Thunderbird、KaiOS。此外，如果你使用过时的操作系统，ESR 也是你唯一能依赖的 Firefox 版本，如微软在 2023 年 1 月终止支持的 Windows 7 和 Windows 8，以及苹果的 MacOS 10.14、10.13 或 10.12 等等。


消息来源：Mozilla



老王点评：其实，过期的操作系统和浏览器，也不是不能用，不换有不换的原因。]]></summary>

最近，我在一个电话会议上听到有人说开源社区是好奇心和解决问题的文化的结合。好奇心是我们解决问题的基础。在解决各种规模的问题时，我们使用了大量的开源工具，其中包括在功能极为方便的树莓派上运行的 Linux。

我们每个人都有各种不同的生活经历，所以我向我们的作者社区询问了他们所遇到的最奇特的树莓派用途。我有一种预感，这些令人惊奇的构建将会为其他人激发灵感。

使用树莓派进行实验

对我来说，树莓派是在家庭网络中增加额外开发资源的绝佳工具。如果我想要创建一个新的网站或者尝试一个新的软件工具，我不必让我的桌面 Linux 机器因为一堆我可能只在实验时使用一次的软件包而变得笨重。相反，我会将它设置在我的树莓派上。

如果我认为我将要做一些冒险的事情，我会使用备份的启动环境。我有两张 microSD 卡，这样我就可以在树莓派上插一张卡，同时设置第二张卡进行任何我想要的实验。额外的 microSD 卡成本并不高，但在我想要在第二个镜像上进行实验的时候，它能节省大量时间。只需关机，换下 microSD 卡，重新启动，立即就可以在专用的测试系统上工作。

当我不进行实验时，我的树莓派充当打印服务器，将我的非 WiFi 打印机连接到家庭网络上。它还是一个方便的 SSH 文件服务器，让我可以快速备份重要文件。

— Jim Hall

树莓派的流行

我见过的树莓派最令人惊讶的事情是它使小型单板计算机的概念变得流行和通俗化，并使其真正实用于大众。

在树莓派出现之前，我们有类似的小型单板计算机，但它们往往是小众的、昂贵的，并且从软件角度来看让人拒之千里。树莓派价格便宜，便宜到任何人都可以轻松为一个项目获得一台（不考虑目前难以获得的情况）。一旦它变得便宜，人们就会克服软件挑战，使其足够好以解决许多基本的计算任…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[技术兄弟们，大家好，在这篇文章中我们将介绍如何在 Ubuntu 22.04 中安装和使用 Wireshark。


Wireshark 是自由开源的、跨平台的、基于 GUI 的网络数据包分析器，可用于 Linux、Windows、MacOS、Solaris 等。它实时捕获网络数据包并以人类可读的格式呈现它们。它使我们能够监控微观层面的网络数据包。它还有一个名为 tshark 的命令行程序，它执行与 Wireshark 相同的功能，但通过终端而不是通过 GUI。

Wireshark 可用于网络故障排除、分析、软件和通信协议开发，也可用于教育目的。Wireshark 使用名为 pcap 的库来捕获网络数据包。

Wireshark 的功能


支持检查数百种协议

能够实时捕获数据包并保存它们以供以后离线分析

一些用于分析数据的过滤器

捕获的数据可以动态压缩和解压缩

支持多种数据分析文件格式，输出也可以保存为 XML、CSV、纯文本格式

可以从以太网、WiFi、蓝牙、USB、帧中继、令牌环等多种接口捕获数据


先决条件


预装 Ubuntu 22.04

具有 sudo 权限的本地用户

互联网连接


Wireshark 安装步骤

从 Ubuntu 仓库安装

Wireshark 包可在默认的 Ubuntu 仓库中找到，并且可以使用以下命令简单地安装。但你可能无法获得最新版本的 wireshark。

$ sudo apt update
$ sudo apt install wireshark




选择 “Yes” 允许非超级用户使用 Wireshark 捕获数据包：



安装成功后，访问 Wireshare UI。从“活动Activities”中搜索 “wireshark”，然后单击其图标。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am relatively new to my company and I inherited a number of Servers.
 Local physical servers and servers in our AWS cloud accounts.
 The problem is I am not well-versed with Linux. And almost all are Linux based servers. 
 The turn-over process to me is like:
 "this is the Proxy Server."
 "This is the authentication server."
 "This is our logging server."
 "This is our ticketing server."
 "This is a DB server for tests, etc"
 "This is our monitoring server"
 -Here are the admin credentials. 
 Actually helps a lot that I got the admin accounts of all these servers so I can freely see what's inside in each server. 
 Now I kind'a need (and also want) to understand everything inside each server since I will be the one maintaining these servers, plus I will do the planning to upgrade or impro…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[《心智与政治秩序》，吴彦著，商务印书馆，2023年6月出版，320页，56.00元

《心智与政治秩序》具有一种老派的风格。它勾勒了一个庞大而整全的体系，也预告了更完整的写作计划。在这个意义上说，这部著作的确是罕见的，充满了智识上的坚忍和勇气。
吴彦的出发点是对自由主义政治哲学的不满。除去一些被自由主义的批评者重复指出的问题外，吴彦以一种具有新意的方式，提出了自己的问题：自由主义政治哲学忽略了中介问题，偏于个人和国家两极，人为制造了个人与国家的对立。其结果导致了个人和国家都变得空洞化，而空洞化又使人败坏，最终让国家也跟着败坏了。吴彦是这样说的：“……循着个人与国家的二分而在两种基本立场之间——或是偏于国家或是偏于个人——徘徊，从而遗忘了国家在其发挥其理应发挥的作用时所依赖的一种介于国家和个人之间的存在，那便是各类共同体。”（138页）
除了这条线索之外，吴彦还提示了另一条线索，就是书名所揭示的“心智与政治秩序”之间的关系。吴彦说，“政治和心智具有很强的同构性”（48页）。“我们的社会和政治结构在很大程度上立基于心灵的这一基本构造之中，尤其是心灵中那些与道德和政治现象密切相关的元素……有关心灵活动的研究以及重塑心灵活动的技艺，在很大程度上将构成我们未来道德和政治哲学探究和活动的基础。”“一种良好的道德和政治秩序就是内嵌于人的心灵之中的‘理性’的一种展现。”（84页）这里提出的是一个古老的问题。但是这条线索令人困惑，因为读者并不容易理解，究竟在“个人—共同体—国家”这一秩序中，心灵的秩序是怎样与之同构的，而国家又究竟对应着心智的哪个部分。这样的问题在柏拉图那里，答案是清晰的。
从作品的整体结构来看，中介问题才是要点所在。吴彦试图凭借托马斯主义的传统，为政治哲学重新找回这些作为中介的共同体。他尤其强调了家庭和大学这两个典型的次级共同体。可以理解。因为这两个次级共同体与德性论密切相…]]></summary>

He has given me access to courses on A Cloud Guru that can allow me to complete any certifications if I wanted to. I have no prior experience with Linux or anything tech related. I'm about 25% done with the Linux Foundation Certification already. I just graduated college with an economics major. I'm willing to get these certifications but I'm looking to get a job as soon as possible. 
 Which certification would be my best bet into getting a job quick with no other prior experience besides that certification?
 How long would it take me to land a job that can potentially be remote?
 What are other ways/jobs/certificates/trainings that would land me a job ASAP within this field (or other fields in general) since I have so much access to course trainings.

Identify what "snap" apps are currently installed on their computer.
 Automatically download the corresponding "Flatpak" version of those apps.
 Remove the "snap" version from their system.
  
To make this tool work better, I need a list of "snap" apps that also have "Flatpak" versions available. I started with a list from a project called "unsnap," but it's a bit outdated now, so I'm looking for a more updated and comprehensive list.
 If you know of any recent and complete lists of "snap" apps with their "Flatpak" alternatives, I would really appreciate your help. This way, more people can use the tool to switch to "Flatpak" packages easily, even for a larger variety of apps. Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi guys,
 so I just switched from Windows to Linux and I decided to use Fedora 38 as my first system.
 I installed the OS, updates, upgrades, etc...
 The nvidia driver is installed (latest version I believe so), but the system feels very slow for some reason. Also the steam is getting bug reloading the store page (App installed in the software center). Also got a bug where I was watching a friend stream on discord and it was having a lot of stuttering (had to switch to discord app and worked just fine). I think my pc specs wouldn't do this since never happened on windows. In case the problem is really the system I will maybe switch to Linux Mint since was the 1st option I had in mind due to friendly user.
 Someone using Fedora 38 and having the same issue or already had and was able to resolve?
 Nvidia version: 535.54.03
 NVML Version: 12.535.54.03

I fell in love with superb performance but the sweetest bit for me was how streamlined my workflow became using SSH for everything, Remmina etc.
 How easy would it be to move to Debian instead as my daily driver workstation? I love Ubuntu but snaps are hideous and I feel I should really go with a truly fully Open Source distro, especially after watching "Learn Linux TV"'s latest YouTube video. Currently on Ubuntu 22.04.

 If I look at nmcli -p device, it shows eno1/ethernet as unmanaged, and the loopback the same as unmanaged. If I look at ip address cmdlet output, it still shows eno1 picking up addressing.. 
 .. what am I missing here? How can get the net connection reinstated?

 I'm looking for offline app for mind maps, thought maps with android app but that's not a must. I have installed XMind and I don't know yet if it's good to invest my time in it. Will be there a need for net access for some essential function? Maybe there are some other great apps of that kind that you use.

 I am in the process of buying a new laptop and I would VERY MUCH like to only use amd hardware... the problem right now is that only the asus tuf a16 have a new amd cpu and gpu inside it or else i should look at yoga 6 for iGPU 780m.
 There are many MANY reasons why i would like to NOT use nvidia.. but if I have to... then how does it perform now...
 I have heard it has gotten better with wayland, but by how much ?... how is it compared to AMD today ?
 is it any good, will it get better ?
 thanks :)

he is now using that experience to write a series on "Red Hat and the Clone
Wars".  The first two episodes were Red
Hat and the Clone Wars and A
history of the early 2000s Linux landscape; the latest is The
dawn of CentOS:


	In 2009, the main project admin for CentOS went radio
	silent. CentOS had been spun up in the wild west days of the
	Internet, when it seemed totally fine to let one person hold the
	domain, communications channels, and funds. Oops.

	Folks depending on CentOS suddenly had a Come to Jesus moment. What
	happens if your production systems depend on a project where the
	main admin is AWOL and you have no plan for that?]]></summary>

One thing i noticed is when i boot linux it just open grub directly then boot my os, there is no logo of the hardware manufacturer in my case asus, but when i boot windows there is a logo of asus first then after a while it start booting windows, why is this? My theory is windows is the one that displaying the manufacturer logo to create the illusion of its the hardware loading up because if it was all windows logo it will make it look so slow. And the hardware manufacturer gets branding in returns. I know this is such a noob assumption but am really curious

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As a person who has used both Windows, Mac and Linux, I have come to the conclusion that this is the time for me and others to switch to Linux. I am in control of what I do; in Linux the majority of distros have no ads, and no "reccomended settings" that Microsoft tries to get you to use to sell more personal info. Trying to install Windows 11 got my computer in a boot loop and had to take out a battery underneath my gpu (I am very inexperienced with the physical side of computers) so I have given up hope for Windows. I will still have a Windows 10 VM for special windows apps that don't work with Wine - but Linux is getting a lot more recognition than it had in the past.

 Maybe your own package manager? Your own provisioning system? Your own desktop environment?
 The question is purely philosophical. I am not going to make another "cool Linux distribution". I am just interested in the opinion of the community.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've been using Linux on my desktop for about a year now and I am all in. I always knew Windows was junk but had no idea how bad it was until I tried an alternative. People I know are tired of me using any excuse to all over it. lol
  
 My career has stalled out a little bit this month and its time for me to rethink what I want to do with my life. I have over a decade of experience as a full stack web developer so I have a good understanding of the basics of programming. I've even maintained a few Linux web servers but didn't do anything special to configure them.
  
 Even in IT, everyone is convinced that you need to be big brained to have anything to do with Linux so there aren't tons of people out there that know how to use it. It makes me wonder what I would have to learn to pivot into being a system admin or something. I don't know. This whole thing is an idea that just popped into my head 10 min ago so I am still figuring things out. Any advice? Certifications or courses you would recommend? Is there a lot of remote work for a person that knows a lot about linux?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[libjpeg-turbo 3.0 发布，开发者表示无力继续

这个开源的 JPEG 图像编解码器每天有数十亿人通过浏览器、操作系统和图像查看器/编辑器使用，并且它是 ISO/ITU-T 的参考实现，经过了严格的审查。它的主要开发者 DRC 在 3.0 发布公告中说，这可能是功能开发的结束，很可能不会有 3.1 版本。DRC 表示，目前该项目只有每月约 8-10 小时的一般资金支持。而完成 3.0 测试版需要借用 2023 年所有预期的一般资金，而修复错误需要借用到 2024 年 9 月的所有资金，也就是说该项目未来 15 个月实际上将处于 “维护模式”。它的开发者 DRC 的大部分收入来自他的另外两个项目 VirtualGL 和 TurboVNC，而从 2010-2018 年，DRC 投入了相当于几十万美元的时间来开发 libjpeg-turbo 2.0，甚至导致负债时，不得不停止在该项目上投入。

老王点评：很多开源开发者花费了自己的时间金钱来贡献给开源，但是他们也需要钱来生活。不知道那些嫌弃别人白嫖他们的开源代码的人，是不是也白嫖过其它的上游项目呢？




Valve 拒绝发布带有人工智能生成内容的游戏

一位独立开发者在论坛上发帖说，Valve “不再愿意发布有人工智能生成内容的游戏”。他们提交的游戏有 “一些相当明显的 AI 生成的素材”。Valve 在给开发者回复中称，“我们不能发布开发者没有所有必要权利的游戏。目前，我们拒绝分发你的游戏，因为我们不清楚用于创建素材的底层人工智能技术是否对训练数据有足够的权利。”考虑到大多数人工智能工具不能真正声称对其所有的训练数据有合法权利（即使它们有，也可能不是对该数据的道德使用），这一政策的陈述基本上相当于对游戏中人工智能生成的资产的全面禁止。Valve 表示，他们的政策更多的是 “法律上的要求”，而不是对人工智能的任何特定立场，其审查过程“是对现行版权法和政策的反映，而不是我们意见的附加层。”


消息来源：Tech Crunch



老王点评：这件事凸显了现有的版权法律无法适应人工智能的需要。究竟什么样的内容可以被人工智能刮取并生成内容，然后这些内容的版权归属于谁。如果要归属于原内容提供者，人工智能是否有可能、有意义地明确地指出来源？




谷歌将用网络上公开的所有信息训练人工智能

谷歌上周末更新了其隐私政策，明确表示该公司保留刮取你在网上发布的所有信息以建立其人工智能工具的权利。谷歌举例说，将“使用公开的信息来帮助训练谷歌的人工智能模型，并建立产品和功能，如谷歌翻译、Bard 和云人工智能功能”。以前，谷歌说这些数据将被用于 “语言模型”，而不是 “人工智能模型”，而旧政策只提到谷歌翻译，现在也包括 Bard 和云人工智能。


消息来源：Gizmodo



老王点评：和上一条对应，谷歌利用互联网“公开”的信息训练的人工智能，其输出的内容的版权如何界定？现在大家都黑不提白不提的就这样糊涂着，是想造成既成事实倒逼法律认可，还是需要更多的实践和探讨？]]></summary>

 As far as I have found out, the limiting factors for computational speed of this PC are low RAM capacity (i work with experimental datasets in python and OriginPro 2021,some datasets files can grow into 1-2gb-ish volume ) and HDD speed. 
 I can spare a little money for used 2*8gb ddr3 kit, but I don't really wanna buy new ssd. 
 I am quite pissed off on how strong lag can be produced by windows defender or telemetry when those instances are running. 
 So, I am planning to install archlinux (so my system would be free of useless bloat- and malware) on free partition of HDD in hope I would get smoother experience and a lot of other Linux advantages. Would be BTRFS a good pick for hdd or should I pick other file system? If I was installing Linux on ssd I would've picked F2FS.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[了解如何使用用于切换目录的一个基本但必不可少的 Linux 命令。


Linux 中的 cd 命令用于更改目录。cd 实际上是“更改目录change directories”的缩写。

这是你必须了解的 基本 Linux 命令之一。

使用 cd 命令非常简单：

cd path_to_directory


不可能比这更简单了，对吧。

然而，你应该理解它的路径部分，以便轻松地浏览 文件系统 而不会感到困惑。

这是绝对路径和相对路径的快速回顾：



如果你需要更多细节，我建议你阅读这篇文章：


Linux 上的绝对路径和相对路径有什么不同


让我们看一些使用 cd 命令的示例。

使用绝对路径更改目录

从视觉上看会更容易理解。看下图。



我当前的位置是我的主目录（/home/abhishek），我必须进入 scripts 目录中的 python 目录。

假设我想使用绝对路径。python 目录的绝对路径是 /home/abhishek/scripts/python。

cd /home/abhishek/scripts/python




使用相对路径更改目录

让我们举同样的例子，但这次我将采用相对路径。



我的主目录到 python 目录的相对路径是 scripts/python。让我们用这个：

cd scripts/python




进入上级目录

到目前为止，你一直在进入下级。如果你必须进入上级目录怎么办？

假设你位于 /home/abhishek/scripts/python 中，并且必须将目录添加到 scripts？



使用绝对路径始终是一种选择，但它相当冗长。相反，你可以使用特殊的目录符号 ..。双点 （..）表示父目录或上一级目录。单点（.）表示当前目录。

cd ..


这是一个例子：



你可以使用 .. 在 Linux 文件系统层次结构中向上移动路径。

假设我在上图中的 python 目录中，想要进入 code 目录。这是我能做的：

cd ../../code




进入主目录

如果你在所有这些目录切换中感到迷失并想回到主目录，有很多简单的快捷方式。

事实上，最简单的就是使用不带任何选项的 cd 命令。

cd


这将使你从文件系统上的任何位置返回主目录。

或者，你可以使用 ~ 符号，表示主目录。

cd ~




进入根目录

尽管你不会像前一个那样经常使用它，但了解一下仍然有好处。

如果你想返回文件系统开始的根目录，请使用以下命令：

cd /


这里不涉及“魔法”。当放在路径开头使用时，/ 表示根。不要将它与路径分隔符混淆。



切换回上一级目录

这是一个救命稻草，或者我应该说是“省时稻草”。当你深入目录结构，然后转到另一个目录，然后你觉得需要返回到以前的位置时，此快捷方式会有所帮助。

cd -


还不清楚吗？ 让我举个例子。

我位于 /etc/apt/sources.list.d。从这里，进入 /home/abhishek/scripts/python 来处理我的代码。然后我意识到我必须再次检查 /etc/apt/sources.list.d 目录中的某些内容。

通常的方法是这样做，这让我再次输入所有路径：



但聪明的方法是使用这个：



看吧，无需再次输入冗长的路径。如期工作！

🏋️ 练习时间

如果你想练习 cd 命令，这里有一些练习供你使用。


打开终端并进入 /var/log 目录。检查目录内容。你看到了什么？

现在，进入 /var 目录。这是一个上级目录。

从这里返回你的主目录。


这些内容足以让你熟悉 cd 命令。以下是你应该了解的其他一些重要命令。


每个 Ubuntu 用户都应该知道的 31 条 Linux 命令


如果你有疑问或建议，请告诉我。

Kali Linux 是一个基于 Debian “测试版” 的 Linux 操作系统，创建于近十年前。在过去几年里，它在黑客和网络安全专业人员中非常流行。随着对数字基础设施的越来越多的依赖和网络威胁的不断增长，网络安全对于普通用户和企业来说变得更加重要。

道德黑客和渗透测试人员在识别漏洞和加强系统安全方面发挥着重要作用。由于 Kali Linux 具备为安全测试和分析而量身定制的全面工具和功能，因此成为他们的首选操作系统。



概述

Kali Linux 由 Offensive Security（一家美国信息安全公司）维护，并得到社区中数千名贡献者的支持。它跟随 Debian 的 “测试版” 分支的发展，保持与最新软件包的同步，为黑客们提供了最新模块来进行工作。

此外，Kali Linux 支持多种架构，例如 x86、x86-64、armel 和 armhf，这有助于黑客在广泛的硬件范围内使用。

使用此发行版的最大优势之一是它适用于多个技术平台，你可以下载和使用。以下是其中一些平台：


32 位和 64 位的安装镜像（ISO）

预构建的虚拟机镜像

ARM 架构镜像

用于移动设备的安卓镜像

Docker 和 LXD 镜像

可在各个厂商提供的云中使用

只读的 LIVE ISO 镜像

可在 Windows 的 Linux 子系统（WSL）上使用


为何它备受青睐

强大的渗透测试工具

Kali Linux 提供了丰富的渗透测试工具，使黑客能够识别并利用漏洞。这些工具包括网络扫描器、密码破解器、无线攻击框架和 Web 应用程序评估工具。这个操作系统内置了如此之多的工具，极大地简化了黑客的工作流程，使他们能够有效专注于目标。

I see references to various offerings like ALP, Liberty, SLES etc. I am familiar with the RH ecosystem of products and projects a bit more, and trying to draw some parallels. More specifically, I am interested in container base image -- especially the very small footprint, minimalistic options, that RedHat Universal Base Image (UBI) offers. More specifically, I am looking for any similar offerings from SuSE that are actually backed by strong commercial support.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[中华书局本《谈艺录》118页引宋人《四六话》的名言，以论放翁云：“《四六话》论隶事，有‘伐山语、伐材语’之别；放翁诗中，美具难并，然亦不无蹈袭之嫌者。”意谓陆游多是“伐材”，“非拓境宇、启山林手也”。444页补订云：“不知东坡为用此事之伐山手，放翁以下皆只伐材。”498页语及用《寒食帖》事又云：“按晁冲之伐山，始取《寒食帖》入诗，南宋多继而伐材者。”“伐山、伐材”之别，见于王铚《四六话》卷上：“四六有伐山语，有伐材语。伐材语者，如已成之柱桷，略加绳削而已；伐山语者，则搜山（搜山一作披山）开荒，自我取之。伐材谓熟事也，伐山谓生事也。”（据《历代文话》本）简言之，凡是第一个用别人所从未用过的事，就是“伐山”；而用别人所已经用过的事，就是“伐材”。“伐山”优于“伐材”，是不必说的。文人作文如是，学者著书亦然。所以顾炎武另有一个著名的比喻，那就是其《与人书十》中说的：“今人纂辑之书，正如今人之铸钱。古人采铜于山，今人则买旧钱，名之曰废铜，以充铸而已。”拟喻虽有不同，精神却是相通的。乃至于学人征文考献，亦贵伐山的第一手材料，而轻转手的伐材之事。通人必须博览，但是“书囊无底”，所以就是通人，也免不了有时要“伐材”。我去年年底时，因为住在铜陵，手边无别的书可读，所以把三十年前读过的《谈艺录》，又重读了一过，因此而屡见博极群书的钱先生所引的书，也多有是从伐材而得的。钱先生的“伐材之事”，我以前在《钱边缀琐》中指过一些，但那是瞥记随举的，不及这次所获之多。故写为一篇，供给研究“钱学”及喜谈掌故的人参考。
一
钱先生于陈衍的著述，无疑是谙熟于胸的，《石语》记陈誉其云“世兄记老夫诗熟”，可为一证。这都不必多说。陈的《石遗室诗话》，在钱先生的《中文笔记》中，却并没有笔记，那可能是因为太熟之故，所以不复札之于纸了。《谈艺录》中则多次引及石遗，在近人中是少有的，但暗本《石遗室诗话》，而又不加注明的，也…]]></summary>

 Are they needed? Firewalls?
 I used to basically DENY everything on the 3 chains and then explicitly let through certain things like my browser, etc?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello, so I was trying to build a custom wheel of Onnx Runtime and my computer completely crashed and rebooted on its own.
 During boot, it said something about hardware and then on another screen, something about (username) ttyl
 Weird but I thought nevermind, I'll do it again. On the second attempt, I updated/upgraded packages as usual and two words in the terminal caught my eye "initramsfs" and "grub". I remembered this because I had some issues booting into Linux in another computer.
 Regardless, I tried building the wheel again and once again, computer hard crashed/reboot. 
 I reset my bios settings but this time it booted straight into Windows. I never got the Grub screen.
 I booted into BIOS but it won't show my Linux boot option. Used the Boot Repair option in a live usb twice and Linux will still not show up in boot options.
 I also tried the fsck command on my root drive but it said it was mounted, even thought I used the sudo umount command before that.
 Can someone tell me why building an image may have crashed my computer and why I can't boot into Linux?
 Edit 2: Booted in with a live usb again and ran sudo fack /dev/sda2 and it returned clean, 1901093/16416768 files, 29049565, 65636608 blocks

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Yo, I threw together a little "plugin" for zsh/bash (and probably any POSIX-compatible shell) that helps work with multiple git repositories that have different "main" branch names – master and main obviously.
 Recently, various projects have been using both main and master as the name of the "main" branch in the project. This adds a bit of mess in my UX.
 This "plugin" keeps track of the status of some git subcommands that require a branch name (switch, checkout, merge, rebase, log are now supported).
 If you mistype the branch name, this tool will try to correct the command.
 For example: You type git switch main, but the main branch does not exist in the current repo – BranchFixer will correct the branch name to master.
 Thus, git switch master will be executed instead of git switch main.
 If it's useful to anyone, use it :)

 P.S. PRs and ideas for improvements are welcome

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[On my linux server i have all my partitions (all but /boot) encrypted via LUKS. I have also installed dropbear to remotely unlock the disk after reboot via SSH.
 Sometimes the power goes out and my server will reboot after getting power again but stops booting as the decryption password will be needed.
 I want to automate the process by providing the server with the decryption password over network. First i wrote a script which tries to unlock the system remotely every couple of minutes via cron. This works but is not a very good solution.
 I want a solution where the server pulls the password from another server automatically. 
 How would i go about writing an initramfs script which tries to access another server, pull the password from there and unlock itself via that password?
 Or does it make sense to try to alter the dropbear initramfs files so that it pulls the password from another server. https://ubuntu.pkgs.org/22.04/ubuntu-universe-amd64/dropbear-initramfs_2020.81-5_all.deb.html 
 I can not use a UPS and i do not want to save the password in plaintext on the machine itself for obvious reasons.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There are existing HN job aggregators, but I thought we could take it a step further.
Inspired by an insightful comment on a previous thread (https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36163021), I built a tool that aggregates job postings and intelligently categorizes them based on user-specific preferences:
* Country and remote work preferences
* Employer type (e.g., startup, corporation, government)
* Industry
* Technologies used
* Role type (developer, architect, product owner, etc.)
* Salary range (where available)
One of the superpowers of LLMs is reformatting information from any format X to any other format Y.
We leverage this to map all the unstructured job postings into the same unified structure. The new GPT functions feature and the extended context windows are really helpful for this.
Instead of having to build a custom NER pipeline, it works very well with GPT out-of-the box.
One challenge is keeping the filters consistent and merging of duplicates. Embeddings help with that.
What's next:
* Integrate additional sources. We can generate web scrapers and data processing steps on the fly that extract and transform data into the same structure.
* Add location distance filters.
* Expand beyond jobs to monitor personalized data like events or real estate. Imagine using AI to rate local events from multiple sources based on your preferences, considering factors like your interests and distance from home.
* Smaller improvements based on your feedback :)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Snap 设计者开发用 Flatpak 替换 Snap 的脚本

已经离开 Canonical 公司的 Alan Pope 是 Snap 软件包格式的共同开发者。Flatpak 和 Snap 都是一种沙盒容器式的软件包格式，旨在提供一种独立于发行版的打包格式，解决包依赖问题，能在不导致依赖地狱的情况下在同一个系统上安装同一个程序的多个版本。Flatpak 是由红帽主导推出的。相比 Snap 只能使用 Canonical 私有的软件包商店，Flatpak 可以支持多个软件仓库。最新的 Ubuntu 23.04 中默认移除了 Flatpak 格式的支持。Alan Pope 开发了一个名为 unsnap 的脚本，如果一个 Snap 软件包存在对应的 Flatpak 包，那么它将会自动用 Flatpak 包替换 Snap 包。


消息来源：Linux 杂志



老王点评：这个脚本并不复杂，作者也坦诚并不成熟。有趣是，作为 Snap 包格式的共同作者之一，他推出这样的脚本。




红帽为 RHEL 7 再增加四年的支持

红帽企业 Linux 7（RHEL 7）发布于 2014 年。所有 RHEL 的大版本都遵循标准的十年生命周期，前五年是全面支持，后五年是维护支持。此后，RHEL 进入延长生命周期阶段，红帽为其提供延长生命周期支持。也就是说，从 2024 年 7 月 1 日开始，红帽将为有需要的客户提供 4 年的 RHEL 7 延长支持服务。顺便提一句，RHEL 7 的下一个版本，RHEL 8 及其下游的 CentOS 8 已经在 2021 年 结束支持，原因大家都知道，是为了给 CentOS Stream 让路。


消息来源：红帽



老王点评：看来当时没有及时迁移到 RHEL 8/CentOS 8 的很多人仍然坚守在 7 上。




首个完全由人工智能生成的药物进入临床试验

一家总部位于香港的生物技术初创公司利用人工智能创造了一种治疗特发性肺纤维化的药物。这种导致肺部结疤的慢性疾病，如果不加以治疗，可在 2 至 5 年内导致死亡。该公司称，“这是第一个进入人体临床试验的完全生成型人工智能药物，特别是与病人进行的第二阶段试验。……该药物是第一个既有人工智能发现的新目标，又有人工智能生成的新设计的药物”。该药物目前已经在中国开展为期 12 周的随机、双盲、安慰剂对照试验。


消息来源：CNBC



老王点评：昨天我们报道了由人工智能设计的芯片，今天看到了设计的药物。以后，我们会看到越来越多由人工智能发现、设计和制造的制品。]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Clipboard 是一个有用的开源工具，具有许多可提高你的工作效率的功能。




想要一个新的智能剪贴板管理器吗？ 🤔

这就是 Clipboard 项目 背后的人们对其剪贴板管理器的看法。他们称之为“第二大脑”，可以随时随地记住任何事情。

你认为呢？ 让我们看一下：

Clipboard：概述 ⭐



Clipboard 主要用古老的 C++ 编程语言编写，提供了许多功能，例如复制/粘贴文本、文件、目录、二进制数据、无限剪贴板等等！

此外，它 与主要的 GUI 剪贴板系统无缝集成 并支持西班牙语、葡萄牙语和土耳其语等语言。

让我向你展示它是如何工作的。


📋 由于这是一个基于终端的应用，因此你必须使用各种命令来操作 Clipboard。


因此，你要做的第一件事是使用以下命令复制文件的内容：

cb copy 'filename'




然后进行粘贴，你可以使用以下命令：

cb paste




要加载所有剪贴板，你可以使用以下命令：

cb show




最后，最吸引我们注意的功能是最近添加的 无限剪贴板历史记录 功能。

你可以使用此命令访问完整的剪贴板历史记录：

cb hs




这个剪贴板应该会 吸引那些更喜欢使用基于终端的应用 而不是基于 GUI 的应用的用户。它提供了非常简单的用户体验以及所有合适的工具。

不要忘了，它包含的功能比我讨论的更多，其中包括：


制作脚本来自动化你的工作流程

能够粘贴你拥有的每种类型的数据，包括二进制数据


那些喜欢图形界面的应用的人可以选择 Pano 剪贴板管理器。它是一个轻量级的剪贴板管理器，与 GNOME 集成得很好。

📥 获取 Clipboard

你可以通过从 GitHub 获取或浏览其 官方网站 开始你的剪贴板之旅。它还包含所有必要的安装指南和文档。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[新的 Anaconda Web UI 安装程序可能会随 Fedora 工作站 39 一同推出。




长期以来，Fedora 的安装体验一直未曾改变。

然而，这个新的 Web UI 安装程序已经开发了一年多的时间，现在离正式实现的目标更近了。

为什么现在是时候了？

在我们上次 了解 即将到来的 Anaconda WebUI 安装程序时，它的进展相当不错。

而现在，它已经提交了一份 变更提案，旨在将这个安装程序添加到 Fedora 工作站中，以提供现代化的用户体验。该提案正等待 Fedora 工程和指导委员会（FESCo）的审查。

让我们再次来看看即将到来的安装程序和提案，以及可以期待在 Fedora 发布中看到它的时间。

Anaconda WebUI：概述 ⭐



目前 Fedora 使用的旧的安装程序是基于 GTK3 的，在许多情况下已被证明效率低下和不安全。新的 Anaconda WebUI 安装程序旨在解决这个问题。

它使用了一个由 Anaconda 团队开发的 基于 PatternFly 的现代后端和用户界面。

后端由 Python、DBus、Cockpit、React 和 PatternFly 组成，旨在从一开始解决许多已知的用户体验问题，并为一致的安装体验铺平了道路。

变更提案还提到了新 UI 的一些关键亮点，包括：


向导式解决方案而非中心轮毂式。

新的欢迎屏幕用于选择语言（将从系统中配置的语言预先选择）。

时区和日期配置。

磁盘选择。

引导式分区。

配置审核。

安装进度。

内置帮助。


主要关注的重点是向用户提供类似向导的体验，提供更多信息，并帮助他们更好地完成安装过程。

这个新安装程序添加了很多功能，听起来是一个很好的用户体验改变！ 😃

那么，我们可以期待什么时候呢？

由于这个变更需要经过 FESCo 的批准，一切取决于投票过程的进行。

但是，我相当有信心这个变更会得到批准，因为 变更提案 已经设定了 在 Fedora 39 中发布新的 Anaconda WebUI 安装程序 的目标。

💬 这个变更批准只是时间问题；您对此有什么看法？

在今日的思想界，霍布斯被视为不可或缺的重要思想家。他所建立的近代社会契约论框架成为现代政治制度的重要来源。不过，正如意大利哲学家诺伯特·博比奥（Norberto Bobbio）所指出的，对霍布斯的再解释更多是二十世纪的结果。在此之前，霍布斯更多被视为不入流的哲学家，是对乃师培根的拙劣模仿。黑格尔的《哲学史讲演录》将霍布斯的思想视为肤浅的经验主义，认为其中缺乏真正的哲学。博比奥诙谐地写道：“那些年里，霍布斯被毫无根据地指控为极权主义国家的先驱。前述霍布斯政治思想研究的最重要成果之一出自一位政治上可疑的作者卡尔·施密特之手。”
《霍布斯与自然法传统》是博比奥关于霍布斯研究数十年结果的集合。作为意大利重要的霍布斯研究者，博比奥认为自然法在霍布斯的政治哲学中占据最为关键的地位。通过将前政治状态转移到自然状态中，霍布斯得以建立自然状态-政治状态的结构演化模型。霍布斯是一个绝对主义者，但也是一个理性主义者。通过彻底的计算理性推论，霍布斯为现代政治找到了一条不依赖于神学的途径。国家不是自然的产物，而是人类的创造。“如果我们接受人类受命改正自然，而不仅仅是模仿自然的话，那么建立国家就是他们作为能工巧匠的能力的最为高尚和最为高贵的表达。”
不过，由于《霍布斯与自然法传统》一书是由博比奥多年来关于霍布斯的文章拼凑而成，所以章节之间没有明显的联系，讨论的内容也显得较为驳杂。对该书的评价更多着眼于他在霍布斯研究一些基本问题上的立场和看法，而非完整的体系论证。
自然状态与自然法
霍布斯的自然状态一直是所有学者研究的重点。即便是不曾读过霍布斯作品的非专业人士，也对霍布斯所描述的“一切人反对一切人”式的自然状态有所耳闻。其中的关键问题在于，这种自然状态究竟是一种纯粹的理论假设…]]></summary>

在今日的思想界，霍布斯被视为不可或缺的重要思想家。他所建立的近代社会契约论框架成为现代政治制度的重要来源。不过，正如意大利哲学家诺伯特·博比奥（Norberto Bobbio）所指出的，对霍布斯的再解释更多是二十世纪的结果。在此之前，霍布斯更多被视为不入流的哲学家，是对乃师培根的拙劣模仿。黑格尔的《哲学史讲演录》将霍布斯的思想视为肤浅的经验主义，认为其中缺乏真正的哲学。博比奥诙谐地写道：“那些年里，霍布斯被毫无根据地指控为极权主义国家的先驱。前述霍布斯政治思想研究的最重要成果之一出自一位政治上可疑的作者卡尔·施密特之手。”
《霍布斯与自然法传统》是博比奥关于霍布斯研究数十年结果的集合。作为意大利重要的霍布斯研究者，博比奥认为自然法在霍布斯的政治哲学中占据最为关键的地位。通过将前政治状态转移到自然状态中，霍布斯得以建立自然状态-政治状态的结构演化模型。霍布斯是一个绝对主义者，但也是一个理性主义者。通过彻底的计算理性推论，霍布斯为现代政治找到了一条不依赖于神学的途径。国家不是自然的产物，而是人类的创造。“如果我们接受人类受命改正自然，而不仅仅是模仿自然的话，那么建立国家就是他们作为能工巧匠的能力的最为高尚和最为高贵的表达。”
不过，由于《霍布斯与自然法传统》一书是由博比奥多年来关于霍布斯的文章拼凑而成，所以章节之间没有明显的联系，讨论的内容也显得较为驳杂。对该书的评价更多着眼于他在霍布斯研究一些基本问题上的立场和看法，而非完整的体系论证。
自然状态与自然法
霍布斯的自然状态一直是所有学者研究的重点。即便是不曾读过霍布斯作品的非专业人士，也对霍布斯所描述的“一切人反对一切人”式的自然状态有所耳闻。其中的关键问题在于，这种自然状态究竟是一种纯粹的理论假设…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Howdy y'all, we've all heard of weird stories of porting Linux to a toaster or whatever. I think it's such a great example of the benefits of open-source software but I don't know of many instances. 
 So I was wondering what are some of the most niche and unexpected devices people have successfully ported Linux to? Whether it's obscure hardware like a calculator watch, or just getting Linux to run on some ancient archaic system, anything that highlights the utility of open-source by adapting Linux to work in crazy environments. 
 Thanks :)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi,
 I'm looking to build a new equipment and I would like some advice on it. I won't play on it so I'm going small size and no dedicated GPU. The use will be navigating the web, watch videos, downloads,... No gaming, no video editing or anything very intensive.
 I know an Intel i3 would be enough but I want something more powerfull and I can't decide between an i5-12400 and a Ryzen 5700G. Which one will perform better with Linux? (I can't tell you which distro because I distrohop like I'm posessed so I usually go with Mint, XFCE or KDE).
 The case I'm thinking of is this one:
 Sparrow MQ4
 So I don't need PSU and the motherboard should be ITX.
 What do you think about the CPU?
 Cheers.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have been a Linux user since the year 2019. I used to run Linux on my all-in-one PC, which had an Intel CPU without any dedicated GPU. The experience there was perfect; I had zero complaints with any of the distributions I tried, but the story changed when I recently bought a gaming laptop with an RTX 3050.
 As expected, the first thing I did was to remove Windows and try to install Fedora on it. At first, the live USB wouldn't even boot because of the missing GPU drivers, so I tried the safe graphics mode, and then, after completing the install, I added the Nvidia drivers. In the beginning, it worked fine, but after some time, performance issues started to occur. Sometimes the OS freezes on the login screen or gives me a blank screen after I enter my password and press enter.
 I was determined that I wanted to use Linux because I like the playing around and freedom that it gives the user, so I tried other distros based on Fedora, RHEL, Ubuntu, and even Arch. I tried different DEs and switched between X11 and Wayland, but everything always gave me some kind of performance dip or left my laptop unresponsive just because of the GPU.
 In the past, when I used Linux on my PC and an old laptop that didn't have a GPU, it always worked fine, but now I am forced to use Windows just because Nvidia has a shitty Linux support.
 At this point I am tired of trying to configure everything by myself and yet getting no results, but I really want to move away from windows so if you guys got any suggestions, I am open to that.

Wtf is the problem? It's giving me a real headache. 
 Also I know there's two citras in the discover store, there wasnt before and i alresdy had the problem, I tried installing it through the flathub install command to try fix the problem, it didn't work.
 I also tried uninstalling and reinstalling through both emudeck and the discover store

 I'm kinda struggling to find a general purpose way of transfering colors, fonts, sizes, across very different applications i.e. terminal, i3config, gtk...
 I'm not a top notch programmer but i'm not an idiot either. I've mulled over the issue for a little while and would like opinions before commiting to what i'd consider to be a sizeable amount of work.
 I'm not comming here empty handed either.
 Take the terminal for instance: gogh has a build process that uses yaml for theme definitions, python for generation/building and bash for installation. It would be pretty easy to use/hijack the build process by simply generating a yaml def.
 For anything that's css-like: a tool like sass or similar is perfect, i'd just have to include my variables. I've seen a couple gtk themes using this.
 Any other configuration that uses text files should be trivial, i'm just uncertain what would be the least painful approach.
 Preprocessing options i've been coming across are: - awk / sed - probably the most painful approach imo - gpp - first time using it but seems to be a good powerful solution - node using gulp or grunt and whatever other rendering tool - i have some experience with this toolset but i feel it's not suited for the task and at this point any programming language that has printf/template strings would give the same result.
 What i'm considering is using make to process sources into a build/staging folder and then letting each 'facet' of themeing run their own build processes if needed.
 So what approach have you been using to tackle this problem?

在限制未登录用户访问 Twitter 后，它又遭遇了严重技术故障，Elon Musk 以有人在大规模抓取推文为由宣布了限流措施：普通用户每天只能阅读 600 则推文，认证用户 6000，新注册用户 300（之后又宣布略微放宽限制）。但有开发者认为不是有人在抓取推文，而是它自己的问题导致了它自己对自己发动 DDoS 攻击。

GIMP 3.0 今年有望发表候选版本

最近，GIMP 的主要开发者们召开了自 2019 年来的首次开发者会议，“Wilber Week”。这是一个为期一周的会议，在阿姆斯特丹的 Blender 基金会总部举行。根据会议发布的信息，看起来他们可能会在今年至少开始 GIMP 3.0 的候选版本阶段。目前正在开发的是 GIMP 2.99.16 版本。作为备受期待的对 GTK3 的移植，以及作为 Photoshop 的开源替代品的一系列其他改进，GIMP 3.0 已经酝酿了十年。会议还讨论了可能成立 GIMP 基金会的计划。

老王点评：说实话，已经对等待 GIMP 3.0 没有激情了。或许，抛下沉重的历史包袱的办法就是破而后立。




远程工作使美国人的生产力下降

美国劳工统计局的新数据发现，2022 年有三分之一的美国人在家工作，高于 2019 年的四分之一。调查还发现，在家全职工作的美国人比在办公室的美国人每天少工作 2.5 小时。如果人们回到办公室，像 2019 年一样每天工作 8.2 小时，而不是每天在家的 5.7 小时，那么美国经济就会增加了大约 8 亿周的工作量，即提升 8%。

基于我对 RHEL 和其他红帽产品的热爱，我不得不现在表达一些严厉的看法。我之所以这样做，是因为我希望 RHEL [及/或其克隆版] 对每个人都是 可获得的。

请原谅这次我用词有些激烈，因为我从内心不希望 RHEL 成为 对业余爱好者不可及 的产品。免费的 RHEL 开发者许可证只是转移话题而已，相比于 真正的 RHEL 克隆版存在的时候，它削弱了 广大动手爱好者社区 的热情。

快速回顾：事情是如何走到这一步的

我相信你现在都已经知道为什么红帽公司最近频频出现在新闻中：

但是，如果你对正在发生的事情一无所知，让我给你一个快速时间线的指引，帮助你理解：


红帽公司拥有一个出色的 Linux 发行版，名为 红帽企业 LinuxRed Hat Enterprise Linux（RHEL），支持周期长达 10 年。

与其他任何 Linux 发行版一样，用于构建 RHEL（或 RHEL 的 克隆版）的源代码是公开可用的。

CentOS 利用上述源代码，去除商标，并创建了一个几乎 1 比 1 的 RHEL 拷贝。（我说“几乎”是因为 RHEL 的商标 必须 被删除。）

那些不愿意支付费用只是为了第一次尝试 RHEL 的爱好者社区，现在可以使用 CentOS 来看看是否喜欢它。

公园是十九世纪中期西方为因应工业革命带来的城市问题而创造的产物，它是现代都市之心，是城市规划中始终挥之不去的乌托邦理想。在中国，“公园”一词古已有之，指称的却是官家园林，与西方public park的概念完全不同。中山大学中文系副教授林峥的《公园北京》考察公园作为一个新兴的西方文明装置如何进入近代北京的过程。以公园为视角，该书呈现了晚清至民国北京政治、社会、历史、文化、文学诸方面纷繁复杂的变革。近日，《上海书评》专访了林峥，请她谈谈与近代北京公园互为表里的文化生产与文学想象。

《公园北京：文化生产与文学想象（1860-1937）》，林峥著，北京大学出版社，2022年10月出版，408页，79.00元

您认为公园作为西方文明装置，进入近代北京，体现了另一种现代性。您对这种现代性的解释是以旧纳新、以新化旧，它表现为最旧的帝国遗迹同时也是最新的公共场域，表现为在外观古色古香的建筑内部引入现代设施。为什么这是“另一种”现代性？
林峥：现代性的概念源自西方，与都市相伴相生，纷繁复杂，中国对于现代性的理解，主要体现为晚清五四以来一种以西方（启蒙现代性）为模板的、线性进步的发展观。这样建立在西方启蒙传统加诸被曲解的社会达尔文主义之上的对于现代性的理解，容易造成一味趋新、趋西的心态。同时我认为，中国在现代化、都市化的过程中有自身独特的发展脉络，若以西方的现代性理论轨范中国城市，很难完全解释与涵盖中国的经验，这也是我为何选择“公园北京”作为研究对象的原因。
一方面，公园是西方现代都市文明的象征，清末民初的政府、启蒙知识分子也是从这个思路出发，将公园引进中国；但另一方面，近代北京的公园又不是另起炉灶、照搬西式，而是在前朝皇家园林坛庙的基础上改造开放，这造就了近代北京公园的特殊性。它的风景情致是中式的，内在精神又是现代的，既是最旧的帝国遗迹，也是最新的公共场域。可与之相对比…]]></summary>

 Nonetheless, I think that many of our well known influencers (aka the YouTubers) aren't considering the importance of profit and business culture for the long term survival, and development of Linux as a whole. Valve, Canonical, Red Hat IBM, System76, Tuxedo, etc. they all have different approaches, but they understand that to go further, they can´t rely on donations and patrons forever.

 I had no experience with anything other than Windows when i bought myself a Raspberry Pi 3B+.
 I had an awesome time using it, and looking back on it I'd say it was the only time I ever had a great time with Linux, and didn't have any real issues.
 A year later I started to dual boot Linux on my Laptop. I installed Debian, accidentally wiped the entire SSD, everything worked fine, reinstalled Windows & Debian after noticing it. After booting into Debian I'd get a kernel panic every time, with pulseaudio maxing out one core. I googled the error messages, didn't find any actual fix, so I gave up and used Ubuntu instead. Saying that I had a bad start with desktop Linux would be an understatement.

 Probably a stupid question here. Had been using Zorin OS 16 off and on for the past year or so but recently upgraded to a 7900 XT. Needed a more up to date distro so was looking into Fedora. Not the biggest fan of the standard gnome layout so I was trying the new Budgie spin but there doesn’t seem to be an option to enable the Third Party Repository?
 I had previously installed the standard Fedora and it asked me during setup, didn’t for the Budgie. Not even an option in the software store settings like i’ve seen in all the guides. Is this just available in standard Fedora Workstation? Is this just a Budgie thing? Or am I just a big dummy missing something obvious.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[For years, the tearing protocol has been one of the most controversial features regarding Wayland. Competitive gamers didn't want forced vsync for latency reasons so they kept using Xorg, and many many posts have been made regarding this situation. Only recently it was merged into the Wayland protocol but seemengly no compositor was using it.
 After updating my system about a week ago (notably with the new Nvidia 535 driver), I launched Nier Automata with direct scanout enabled in Hyprland's config file and... surprise! There's no forced vsync and I can notice tearing. I decided to test League of Legends too and it definitely works, I can now uncap my framerate and get it to ~400fps, but if it drops below my monitor's refresh rate (144Hz) tearing is noticeable.
 So... isn't this supposed to be a big thing? Why is no one talking about it?

 I have a server I have put together with Debian linux as the OS. I set it up so that there is a linux software bridge in NetworkManager/nmtui and then added interface eno1 as a slave device to the bridge nm-bridge.
 The bridge has its own MAC address distinct from the eno1 actual physical ethernet device. That's all fine.
 As I picture this in my head, I picture the nm-bridge device as like a physical layer 2 managed switch and the eno1 ethernet port as a computer connected to one of the ports of that managed switch. Then any VM's I create in virt-manager I also assign to nm-bridge an these are just equivalent to new computers being plugged into the layer 2 man…]]></summary>

 Just on a short note:
 - Recently we acquired Linux.Forum and have set up our Linux.Chat Support Forums
 - We've repurposed Linux.Community as a Linux and open source focussed Lemmy instance (Reddit-like) 
 This brings our community count to 5:
 => #linux on Libera.Chat
 => Linux.Chat on Discord
 => @linux.social (Mastodon instance)
 => Linux.Chat Support Forums (on linux.forum)
 => Linux.Chat Communities (on linux.community)
 A Matrix instance is coming at some time in the future as soon as we've moved our moderation bot architecture to something a bit more platform agnostic.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[马斯克当地时间7月1日表示，为了阻止“极端水平”的数据抓取和系统操纵，推特正在限制用户可阅读的推文数量：已验证的账户限制在每天阅读6000条推文，未验证的账户限制在每天600条推文，未验证的新账户限制在每天300条推文。 ​​​


当地时间7月1日，数以万计的用户抱怨推特没有发布他们的新推文，用户会收到“超出限制”的错误提示。


在一条推文中，马斯克详细介绍了修改后的使用配额。经过验证的帐户每天最多可以浏览6000条推文，而未经验证的账户则最多浏览600条推文。新注册的未经验证的账户面临着更严格限制，每天最多发300条推文。


随后，马斯克又发布一条推文称，很快，已验证的账户浏览推文数量的限制将增加到8000条，未验证的账户将增加到800条，新注册的未验证用户将增加到400条。


马斯克表示，推特正在努力应对“极端程度的数据抓取”和“系统操纵”。他说，这些新的限制是遏制这些紧迫问题的重要措施。他没有透露谁在抓取推特的数据，也没有说明这个问题持续了多长时间和详细解释系统如何被操纵。


马斯克此前曾对推特上的数据抓取表示担忧，并暗示他可能会对不良行为者采取行动。今年4月，他对微软“非法”使用推特数据表示愤怒，显然是指微软与人工智能公司OpenAI的合作，OpenAI在“来自互联网的大量不同文本数据集”上训练人工智能模型，马斯克说，“他们非法训练使用推特数据。诉讼时间到了。”


这并不是推特近几个月来遇到的第一个技术问题，也不是第一个为解决问题而设计的非常规解决方案。本周早些时候，推特开始限制未登录帐户的用户通过桌面和移动设备上的网络浏览器访问推文和个人资料。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[中国用人工智能在 5 小时内设计出 RISC-V CPU

在一篇由中科院、中科大的研究人员发表的论文中，详细介绍了他们在 5 小时内设计出一个新的工业规模的 RISC-V CPU 的工作。据称，这要比人类团队完成类似的 CPU 设计快 1000 倍左右。该 CPU 的设计是 “仅从外部输入-输出观察中形成的，而不是正式的程序代码”。它还拥有令人印象深刻的 11 个 9 的的准确性。该 CPU 采用 65 纳米制造，可以以高达 300MHz 的速度运行。他们在该 CPU 上运行了 Linux 内核 5.15 的操作系统，基准测试显示该 CPU 性能大约与 i486 相当。研究人员认为，他们“从头发现了冯-诺伊曼架构”。

老王点评：重要的不是设计出来的芯片有多强，而是 AI 可以这么快就完成了芯片设计，而且走了一条不同的设计道路。更好的是，这是国内的团队完成的研究。




为什么 Mastodon 无法取代 Twitter

即使 Twitter 用户体验多么糟糕，它的老板多么令人讨厌，它的用户仍然留在那里，去中心化微博客替代 Mastodon 未能吸引到更多 Twitter 用户。一位前 Mastodon 实例管理员解释了其中的原因：对于绝大多数用户而言 Mastodon 没有独特的卖点，从功能上讲它本质上是 2008 年的 Twitter，而从功能角度看 2023 年的 Twitter 能让绝大多数用户满意；对 99% 的用户来说去中心化不是卖点，就像绝大多数用户不在意开源或自由软件，在意识形态上也不反对私有软件；去中心化让用户体验糟糕；管理 Mastodon 的人对现状感到满意，他们认为其他人只需要接受就行，新用户无法将他们的体验反馈给管理者，他们会选择离开；Mastodon 扩展性不行，其用户群只接受慈善不接受其它任何资助模式；在很大程度上，Mastodon 的文化是排外的。


消息来源：Solidot



老王点评：去中心化并不是灵丹妙药，甚至我觉得它可能会一直处于非主流，虽然它的存在是非常必要的。




谷歌决定不支付加拿大的“链接税”

加拿大通过了《在线新闻法》，要求谷歌和 Facebook 为简单地显示新闻链接付费，而其他人都是免费的。谷歌和 Facebook 都拒绝了加拿大的要求，它们都决定从其平台上删除加拿大的新闻内容。谷歌称，“对链接进行定价（所谓的‘链接税’）的史无前例的决定，为我们的产品带来了不确定性，并使我们仅仅因为方便加拿大人获取加拿大出版商的新闻而面临不设上限的财务责任。”谷歌在 2021 年 1 月对澳大利亚的 “链接税” 法律采取了类似的立场，但谷歌在几周后就同意为澳大利亚的新闻付费。此外，谷歌还同意向法国新闻网站支付费用。而美国也正在制定类似的法律。


消息来源：Ars Technica



老王点评：看来“吃大户”的想法哪里都有，就像还有些人准备让大型 IT 公司额外负担光缆的费用一样。但是从另外一个方面看，似乎这些具有垄断性质的 IT 巨头，应该承担更多的责任和付出。你怎么看呢？]]></summary>

The theory is these drives have custom firmware, but I believe it's just as simple as a serial number pair for the drives and dock, plus a 256 bit SATA drive password.
 Installing one of these drives in a PC and attempting to boot from it results in a password prompt. The first 4,096 sectors are supposedly reserved and cannot be read by the host PC over USB. Some people have reported certain Linux tools would allow them to reset the SATA password but I'm not sure this is true. Others have claimed "true" drive cloners could access and dump these reserved sectors, assuming that is true as well.
 This video discusses it but it's nearly a decade old, when these products were relatively new. Has anyone made any tools to dump these sectors, reset the SATA passwords, or do a more complete wipe of these cartidges to make them usable as standard SATA drives?

        <id>https://linux.cn/article-15958-1.html?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss</id>
        <link href="https://linux.cn/article-15958-1.html?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss"/>
        <updated>2023-07-01T09:40:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[以下是如何将用户添加到 Debian Linux 中的 SUDOERS 组的方法。


在 Debian Linux 中，SUDOERS 组在向用户授予管理权限方面发挥着至关重要的作用。将用户添加到 SUDOERS 组使他们能够以 root 权限执行命令，从而为他们提供必要的管理访问权限以在 Debian 系统上执行各种任务。

在安装 Debian Linux 的过程中，如果你将 root 帐户的密码保留为空，那么系统中的 创建的第一个用户 将拥有管理权限。但是，如果你设置了 root 密码，那么用户名将不具有 sudo 权限。因此，在使用用户帐户执行管理任务时，你可能会遇到以下类似的错误。

<username> is not in the sudoers file. This incident will be reported.




本文旨在提供有关在 Debian 中向 SUDOERS 组添加用户的分步指南，确保你可以有效地管理用户权限和系统安全。

如何将用户添加到 Debian 中的 SUDOERS 组

要将用户添加到 Debian 中的 SUDOERS 组，请按照以下简单步骤操作：


单击“终端”图标或使用快捷键 Ctrl+Alt+T，打开 Debian 系统上的终端。

使用以下命令切换到 root 用户：


su -


系统将提示你提供 root 密码。输入 root 密码并按回车键。

以 root 用户身份登录后，输入以下命令。确保根据你的用户名进行更改。在此示例中，将 arindam 替换为你的用户名。

/sbin/addgroup arindam sudo


如果上面的命令无效，还可以使用下面的命令：

usermod -aG sudo arindam


按退出离开 root 提示符。注销并重新登录。现在你可以使用你的用户名执行任何管理操作。

另一种方法

你可以使用与下面相同的命令进入 root 帐户。使用 root 账号登录：

su -


然后使用 nano 或 visudo 或任何编辑器打开 /etc/sudoers 文件。

nano /etc/sudoers


添加以下行和用户名。根据你的用户名替换 arindam。

arindam    ALL=(ALL)    ALL


保存并关闭文件。然后，注销并重新登录。这应该会给用户名 root 权限。

验证 SUDOERS 组成员

要验证用户是否已成功添加到 SUDOERS 组，你可以打开一个新的终端窗口并输入以下命令。将 arindam 替换为你添加到 SUDOERS 组的用户的实际用户名。

sudo -l -U arindam


如果用户是 SUDOERS 组的成员，你将看到他们拥有的权限列表。这是一个示例，你可以看到我的用户名具有所有访问权限。



结束语

将用户添加到 SUDOERS 组将授予他们重要的管理权限。在授予用户此类访问权限之前，仔细考虑用户的可信度和责任非常重要。sudo 使用不当可能会导致系统意外损坏或受损。

请记住在委派管理权限时要小心谨慎，并定期检查用户权限以维护安全的 Debian 系统。

 I've tried a bit of AutoKey, not a lot. AutoHotkey I've used for a while, it does allow creating UI's, but it feels wrong. It's not cross-platform.
 What would you consider a good solution or stack to create similar functionality?
 What functionality? Good question. AutoHotkey and AutoKey let you remap, input devices. I'm not going to say all input devices, but it seems possible. So you hit Mouse4 on your mouse and that could do anything, like press, (Ctrl+~ ; htop) for a quick htop macro if using something like a quake-mode terminal. You do have to manually type each macro by hand. So asking what functionality is it just letting the user type some hotkey in a text file, or is it a UI letting them record a macro, ala vim style.
 I'd rather it be easier for the user and they can choose, a UI or CLI + user created macro file, both options able to be used on demand.
 I'm sure I could name any language or libs/stack and someone could find a way to create it using that. What would you suggest?
 EDIT:
 Came across a post mentioning Python as a possible replacement for AutoHotkey and how it's faster to create a UI. It's not about that for me or this project. The primary goal is cross-platform OSS, if it can't do that, it's not comparable. To me the only difficulty would be finding a library that already has the ability to accept any form of user input from any input device. If the language doesn't offer that, then that language is not an option as this isn't a driver-level project.
 What about something like QMK firmware found on some advanced keyboards? If you know what I just said, fist bump. If you're familiar with Steam Input and how that lets you configure controllers, that's a bit like QMK firmware. That's the goal, to let the user be able to do anything with their devices. I'm ignorant if some library like that exists, you think a gamedev would be able to better answer the question?

寺田浩明教授所著《清代传统法秩序》（日文原名为“中国法制史”，以下称“本书”），是近些年中日法制史学界、明清史学界期待已久的著作。本书一经面世，日本《史学杂志》《法制史研究》《中国研究月报》相继刊发了久保茉莉子、森田成满、高见泽磨等重要学者的书评；赵晶教授主持的《中国古代法律文献研究》（第十二辑，社科文献出版社，2018年）在第一时间刊发了本书第八章的译文（黄琴唐译）以及伍跃、阿风、赵思渊、孔令伟四位分别来自社会史、法律史、经济史、“新清史”等领域的学者撰写的书评。
寺田教授自1983年开始发表了一系列在中日两国均具有重要影响的论文。在本书之前，寺田教授唯一的一本书是中文版的论文集：《权利与冤抑：寺田浩明中国法史论集》（清华大学出版社，2012年），收录了他十五篇主要论文，涵盖了其学术生涯二十六篇论文的主要篇章。在寺田教授四十年的学术生涯（从1977年至本书完成的2017年）中，本书只是第二本书，也是唯一一本体系性的著作。
《清代传统法秩序》的结构
作为代表了一个时代的学者，在退休的时候出版了一生唯一的体系性著作，无论对于作者、同侪、读者，都有非同寻常的意义。因此，复述一下本书的基本内容仍是必要的。
在本书中，寺田教授首先给出了一个理解清代法秩序的基本前提，即“早熟的国家与社会的二元性”，将清代定义为由统一的官僚制国家所统辖的“大规模的市场社会、契约社会、诉讼社会”（第4页）。以此理解为基础，全书从家（家族）的实态开始，依序讨论家的经济基础，家与家之间如何建立、发展出社会，而后逐步进入法与裁判的相关问题。
第一章虽名“人与家”，依次延续滋贺秀三（1921-2008）的理论讨论了“同居共财”的家（父亲所统率、代表的近亲者成为一体而经营生活的生活共同体…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Pirate Enlightenment, or the Real Libertalia by David Graeber, Allen Lane,  January 2023, 208pp

如果大卫·格雷伯在你心目中是一位无政府主义活动家，“占领华尔街”运动的精神领袖，或者是2018年那本《毫无意义的工作》（Bullshit Jobs）的挥斥方遒的作者，你可能会惊讶地发现，他还写过一本关于海盗和政治思想的书，以十八世纪的马达加斯加（位于非洲东海岸外的巨大岛屿，大约有两个半英国那么大）为背景。
事实上，《海盗启蒙》标志着这位著名的人类学家回归了他最初的兴趣。格雷伯于两年前去世，在他还是一名在读研究生时，曾经花了几年时间去马达加斯加做田野考察。他勾搭上一位当地妇女后，发现她认为自己属于一个独特的族群，其成员的祖先可以追溯到加勒比海盗，这激发了他的兴趣。
后来他在大英图书馆发现了一份未曾发表过的十九世纪初手稿，其中收录了一位法国冒险家所描述的马达加斯加复杂的内部历史的片段。该手稿以一位名为拉齐米拉霍（Ratsimilaho）的传奇人物为中心，这位年轻的战士是一名英国海盗与一名马达加斯加妇女的儿子，在十八世纪初他成为了一场长达十年的战争中的领袖，建立了历史上的贝奇米萨拉卡（Betsimisaraka）邦联——位于马达加斯加东北海岸的一个庞大而崭新的政治实体。
几十年来格雷伯一直围着这份手稿的一个副本打转，但直到他生命的最后阶段，才最终坐下来仔细处理其内容。其成果就是这本篇幅不长但引人入胜的书，之前已经出版了法文和意大利文版。
曾活跃于加勒比海的英国海盗从1690年代开始在马达加斯加北部建立基地，方便他们劫掠。1695年，亨利·艾弗里（又名艾维里）及其船员攻击了一支前往麦加的莫卧儿帝国船队，并俘虏了其中两艘满载财富的船只，从而获得了价值六十万英镑（按今天的币值计算约为一亿英镑）的巨额财宝。
英国和法国政府最终成功打击了这种行径。艾弗里失踪了，其他数百名海盗则退至马达加斯加。逍遥法外的白人亡命徒在某个非洲岛屿上建立个人领地的想法令当时的欧洲人兴奋不已。从伦敦到莫斯科，各国政府都在与所谓的艾弗里的使者进行条约谈判，此时在传言中艾弗里已经成为马达加斯加的海盗国王。当时许多流行说法都是对他行径的描述与发挥。
丹尼尔·笛福就是被此类故事所吸引的人之一。在他出版《鲁滨逊漂流记》的几年后，一本名为《海盗通史》的书于1724年在伦敦上市，可能就是他写的。书中描述了一个奉行平等主义的马达加斯加海盗共和国，名为利伯塔利亚（Libertalia）——一个乌托邦殖民地，由思想自由、生活自由的自由海盗组成，致力于贯彻平等主义，人民直接管治。
格雷伯承认，这种说法被广泛认为是一个寓言，而且关于海盗和当地人在三百年前的马达加斯加究竟如何生活，现存的证据少之又少。但他并未因此而退缩。总体上来说，他的任务是论证我们如何看待欧洲启蒙运动从现在已经被遗忘的非欧洲思想家和社会实践中获得的诸多灵感。他推测，贝奇米萨拉卡邦联可以说某种程度上是现实中的利伯塔利亚，“海盗管治和马达加斯加传统政治文化中一些更具平等主义元素的创造性综合”。
他对这一论点的阐述涉及对马达加斯加政治、性别和社会历史的人类学文献的冗长解析。遗憾的是，格雷伯的论述也夸大了海盗式社会关系的先进性，称其具有真正的革命意义。例如，当笛福描述海盗社区通过抽签选择十二个人来解决争端时，格雷伯兴奋地将此吹嘘为他们新颖的“民主制度”的证据，据说是基于海盗船上独特的平等主义环境。他没有注意到的是，这段描述仅仅是对众所周知的陪审团审判原则的翻版，笛福当年的读者肯定会发现这一点。

《万物的黎明》英文书影

和他最近与大卫·温格罗（David Wengrow）合著的《万物的黎明：人类的新历史》（The Dawn of Everything: A New History of Humanity）一样（那本书在更大的范围内提出了相关的论点），读格雷伯的主要乐趣并不在于要同意他的论点。相反，他通过一系列挑衅性的思想实验，一再迫使我们重新思考我们在当下的生活方式。无论十八世纪的马达加斯加发生过什么，《海盗启蒙》意味着，在我们自己的社会、性别与政治安排中，必然能够更进一步地贯彻自由思考和平等主义。

I've been in tech for 20+ years in various fields, in the US, and I have never, ever heard anyone even mention Suse as a candidate distro. I know it's because they market in Europe primarily, but still -- from the looks of it they are solid enterprise option. 
 So, is there any reason why, say, a US company who is considering alternatives to CentOS/RHEL, not to consider SLES?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am still on X11 (don't kill me I am still on Nvidia) and was looking for a screen locker. This lead me to a deep rabbit hole of repeated warnings that there is no way to securely do lock screens on X11. Here is an example https://blog.martin-graesslin.com/blog/2015/01/why-screen-lockers-on-x11-cannot-be-secure/
 Majority of the complaints repeat the following as some of the primary reasons
  
X has no concept of screen lockers.
 A screen locker is just another client for X.
 There is no privileged process which acts as the one and only screen locker
 If the locker crashes you have access to the machine.
 On X11: it’s not possible to prevent that other windows grab screen content. (This is something that Wayland can solve that X11 never can)
  
My questions is why don't display managers take on the task of locking sessions.
 For instance I use LightDM. It seems to run as root, and is what is starting the X server for me.
 If LightDM (or any similar display manager) had a concept of locking sessions, then wouldn't that solve most problems.
  
The display manager could just lock the current session in a given VT
 It will then switch/redirect users to a different VT where the password dialog shows up (this is a different process).
 On successful authentication we can notify the original DM process to unlock the session.
  
Light-locker seems to operate similarly, but LightDM itself does not really seem to know anything about it.
 Obviously we still cannot prevent 5. which is inherent to Xorg, but if I don't care about 5. I don't see why display managers can't do this?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I setup a Ubuntu 22 mail server with Postfix to replace a legacy RHEL server. Everything on the SMTP side works as expected. However, needing help with granting SSH access to clients with signed keys.
 The CA authority signs SSH keys. ssh-rsa and ssh-dss signed keys receive the following error on logs
 'userauth_pubkey: certificate signature algorithm ssh-rsa: signature algorithm not supported [preauth]'
 SSH signed key that is working use rsa-sha2-512
 ssh -Q sig output on the server
  
ssh-ed25519

 [webauthn-sk-ecdsa-sha2-nistp256@openssh.com](mailto:webauthn-sk-ecdsa-sha2-nistp256@openssh.com)
  
I added the following two lines to the /etc/ssh/sshd_config but did not resolve the issue
 PubkeyAcceptedKeyTypes +ssh-rsa
 PubkeyAcceptedAlgorithms=+ssh-rsa
 ​
 I am not in a position to convert all keys to sha2 at this time, so please help me identify what needs to be changed on the server to temporarily authenticate via ssh-rsa and ssh-dss
 I appreciate any help you can provide.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello everyone,
 I'm a Debian family (Ubuntu primarily) user who recently switched to a mechanical keyboard and who is a native italian language speaker.
 The "US Intl. With Dead Keys" layout allows me to type accented characters I need (examples: à è ì ò ù) with just one modifier key right before the non-accented one.
 It works very well but it slows me down. My question is:
 Is there any software/workaround/script that will allow to type a specific defined character every time I double-press something? Example:
  
ee -> should type: è
 oo -> should type: ò
  
Any ideas?
 Thank you!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[For semantics and curiosity sake, do any of you guys know the following? I’ve done some google searches and wasn’t able to find details on the following question.
 Are there any other Enterprise level distributions (Ubuntu, Suse, etc) that have downstream distributions of their enterprise level offerings? From the exposure I’ve had to Ubuntu, there are some security and live patches and faster security fixes. These features are behind a paywall and presumably eventually end up in the main Ubuntu distribution. I am also not aware of any downstream builds of Ubuntu Pro or Suse Linux Enterprise.
 As I’m NOT an enterprise user putting boxes into production with business on the line, and everything I’m reading is that Centos Stream will likely handle what I’m trying to do without much fuss.
 Am I missing something here? Seems to me that Redhat is aligning their offerings and paywalls similarly to Ubuntu and Suse? Am I oversimplifying this, missing a key detail?

 https://ipleak.net/
 To check my ip and also check for leaks

 I run rkhunter, clamAV, lynis, to check for security issues 
 I just found out about the command sudo rpm --verify -a
 That checks all packages for changes I'm still learning how to use it
 Im sure there is alot of usefull commands im not aware of

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all, 
 I'm facing some issues related to the replacement of the my Macbook Pro early 2015 battery. 
 The story: Few years ago I stopped to use my Macbook and at that time the original battery was at 80% capacity. After 1 year (maybe more) I take back my mac and it didn't started without power supply (in the meanwhile nobody used it). Tried to take in charge it for several hours, but not changed, the battery was KO. 
 In add to this, few weeks ago I installed Fedora on my macbook, because MacOS was really slow. The OS works flawlessly, but of course nothing changed regarding the battery (need the power supply to turn on). 
 Last week I bought a non-original battery (a good one, considering the price - I hope :D) but what happens now is that my macbook still do not turn on without power supply, but immediately after the apple logo come up, I can pull off the charger and the macbook go on with its own battery. The strange things: 
 - Fedora do not recognize the battery (tried by terminal), also if in that moment it's working with that 
 - The mac wants the power supply just to turn on (with just the battery it doesn't start). 
 Already tried few SMC reset but nothing changed. Also tried another battery, but got the same result. 
 What it could be? Do you have any recommendations? 
 Thank you in advance.

I know a little here and there about computers and know old tech (excluding exceptions) isn't worth much and is mostly discarded. Since it was super slow on windows 7 , I decided to run xubuntu on it which was the lightest Os I could find. 
 Question? For the above specs , is there any Linux os that could run smoothly on this laptop ? My mom wants it for web surfing. Xubuntu runs but playing YouTube videos is a no go. Is it even possible for this system to run youtube and browse web without too much trouble . I am all ears . Open to suggestions

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Linus 的放松方式是写内联汇编

Linus Torvalds 在改进一个性能优化补丁后说，“有些人通过在泳池边喝杯好酒来放松，我通过玩内联汇编来放松”。这个补丁是为正在进行的 Linux 6.5 合并窗口提出的，它大幅提升了吞吐量，并降低了用于校验的 csum_partial 函数调用的延迟。在某些情况下，可能会有 8~9% 的延迟改善，以及大约 30% 的吞吐量改善。另外一个内核工程师调侃道，“还有第三种人，他们在游泳池边喝着好酒，同时玩着内联汇编”。

老王点评：好吧，真是独特的放松方式。我的放松方式之一就是写写代码，前提是这些代码不让我暴跳如雷。😉




Rocky Linux 反对红帽的决定，并找出了合法获得 RHEL 源代码的方法

在红帽公司决定 限制 对 RHEL 源代码的访问后，并通过服务条款（TOS）和最终用户许可协议（EULA）施加了一些条件，试图阻碍合法客户行使 GPL 所保证的权利。Rocky Linux 认为“这种协议违反了开源的精神和目的”，并已经找出了其它获得 RHEL 源代码的方法：一个选择是通过使用 UBI 容器镜像，它是基于 RHEL 的，可以从多个在线来源获得；另一个方法是通过按使用量付费的公共云实例，从而获得所有软件包和勘误表的源代码，并且可以通过 CI 管道自动完成所有这些工作。Rocky Linux 强调，“这些方法之所以可能是因为 GPL 的力量。没有人可以阻止 GPL 软件的再分发。重申一下，这两种方法使我们能够合法地获得 RHEL 二进制文件和源码包，而不影响我们对开源软件的承诺，也不会受到妨碍我们权利的 TOS 或 EULA 限制。”


消息来源：Phoronix



老王点评：我觉得这件事上红帽是自取其辱。一方面用着 GPL 软件赚钱，另外一方面又试图无视 GPL 许可证赋予的权利。没错，红帽是“没有义务让重新构建者的工作更加容易”，但是从根本上它不能违反 GPL 协议而限制源代码的可得性。最终结果是，RHEL 下游发行版依然存在，红帽却显得吃相难看。




微软公开预览 Windows 11 Copilot

几个月前，微软在 Edge 和必应支持的任务栏搜索栏中加入了生成性人工智能。本周，微软在 Windows Insider 中为公共测试者提供了 Copilot 预览。用户可以按快捷键在屏幕右侧打开 Copilot 栏。除了聊天功能，Copilot 还将支持使用 OpenAI 的 DALL-E 2 模型创建图像。此外，Copilot 还将在一开始就推出必应广告，微软将为你提供该公司 “认为相关” 的广告。


消息来源：Ars Technica



老王点评：说实话我觉得现在的 AI 和操作系统的结合还属于生搬硬套，什么时候操作系统不需要人类“操作”了，才真正的变成了 AI 的“系统”。]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[香港本来只有一所颇具规模的大学，就是以英语教学的香港大学。1963年，中文教学的崇基学院、新亚书院和联合书院合并为“中文大学”。今年香港中文大学的六十周年校庆举办了一系列活动，我应中文系张健教授之邀于4月14日做了一次报告，谈“华人学者对北美汉学的贡献”。
这里“汉学”泛指海外的中国研究（虽说这名词在西方算过时了，学者大多会划定自己研究中国哪一领域）；“北美”则指美国和土地辽阔、人口却只有其十分之一、同属一个学术圈的加拿大。疫情期间香港中文大学曾办了个线上讲座，邀请在斯坦福教中国文学的艾朗诺与当了逾半世纪汉学“票友”的我谈“美国汉学五十年”。我们主要讲朗诺在加州大学、华盛顿大学及哈佛的老师们。我有感于有些人错以为“汉学家”都是白人，而一般“海外汉学”的讨论也有意无意地绕过华人，因此这一趟聚焦于华人学者，谈他们的背景，在汉学界的地位与所扮演的角色，最后略述我对汉学前景的一些看法。
其实北美汉学比欧洲起步晚却后来居上，华人学者的参与非常关键；尤其在文学领域内，近年来可说已取得压倒性的地位。北美汉学界华人多，有下列几个原因：
1）二十世纪初义和团运动，美国获得“庚子赔款”的百分之七点三二，比实际损失的要多些，就决定把多余的款项用以资助中国学生留美，培养了一批中英文俱佳的学人。这一千数百名留美学生大多攻读理工，回国后在各大学、政府机关或私人企业工作，也有一小部分在美国执教。
2）美国铝业公司创办人霍尔（Charles Martin Hall）没有子嗣，遗嘱把财产三分之一留给“英美人士在亚洲或巴尔干半岛办教育的机构”。为争取这笔巨款，当时在北平的燕京大学和美国麻州哈佛大学决定合办“哈佛燕京学社”，于1928年成立。当时北美开设与中国有关的课程寥寥无几，该社资助美国各大学有意从事中国学术研究的学生访华，也资助年轻燕京学人访学哈佛；同时在哈佛设立“哈佛燕京图书馆”和出版《哈佛亚洲研究学报…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[在这份超详细的指南中了解如何通过 i3 窗口管理器来自定义系统的外观和体验。


你可能在网上（尤其是通过 r/unixporn 子区）看到过很多炫酷的截图，用户可以根据个人喜好自定义他们的桌面并与大家分享。

这是因为 Linux 允许你自定义桌面体验的方方面面。

而结果？就是比任何 Mac 或 Windows 系统更具视觉和感知效果。

来看一下这个 😌



看起来像一个 Linux Mint 系统吗？ 😲

但是你怎样才能做到这样呢？自定义你的 Linux 桌面外观是很困难的。

答案就在于 窗口管理器。如果你能配置好窗口管理器，你就能自定义外观。

在本指南中，我将引导你完成使用 i3 窗口管理器 进行基本配置。它是 Linux 上最好的窗口管理器之一。


💡 “加料Rice” 是一个常用的词汇，用来指代在桌面上进行视觉改进和自定义。引用自 /r/unixporn （LCTT 译注：“加料”一词来自于购买便宜的亚洲汽车，并给它们安装售后零件，以让它更好地类似于赛车。）


在遵循本指南之前，你需要了解以下内容：


在本指南中，我将使用 Arch Linux 来演示步骤，但你可以使用你喜欢的任何发行版，结果也是一样的。

请记住，本指南是 对 i3 进行“加料”定制的基础。


在按照本指南进行操作后，你应该得到以下预期结果：




📥 为了节省你的时间，我已经在 GitHub 上上传了与本文相关的所有 i3 配置文件，你可以通过这些文件实现我们在本文中所期望的最终外观。



下载 i3 配置文件


首先，让我们开始安装 i3 窗口管理器。

在 Linux 上安装 i3 窗口管理器

基于 Ubuntu/Debian：

 I think we can all understand the intent of specifically choosing a donkey's butt.
 This breaks no rules, keeps the sub open, and is not horrifying enough for them to shut down while still getting our message across that a certain someone is being a stubborn little boy

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[vDSO is a shared library that the kernel maps into the memory address space of every user-mode application. It is not something that developers need to think about due to the fact it is used by the C library (https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/vdso.7.html).
 Overall, the reason for even having vDSO is the fact they are specific system calls that are used frequently by user-mode applications.Due to the time/cost of the context-switching between user-mode and kernel-mode in order to execute a syscall it might impact the overall performance of an application. 
 Thus, vDSO provides “virtual syscalls” due to the need for optimizing system calls implementations. The solution needed to not require libc to track CPU capabilities and or the kernel version. Let us take for example x86, which has …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I know this question is probably seen alot here, but I'm a Linux beginner, I know a little about it and have dabled in it a little bit but not much other then a few basic commands.
 I feel like Linux Mint is a bit too basic for me and for what I would like to do. I am interested in learning the Linux terminal to possibly learn a bit of network type stuff.
 I have tried Kali but it is debated wether or not it is recommended due to learning how to installl the apps Kali gives you is advised rather then using Kali as a package if you're interested in the cyber security stuff which is one of my main interests. I have tried Ubuntu but that also seems to not be reccomended anymore. Linux Mint looks very basic and I feel like I wouldnt be able to do everything I want in it.
 Bare in mind I would like to daily drive Linux eventually, and due to ease of use I'd like it to be a Debian based distro.
 UPDATE I didnt write the post very well, Im not dissing mint at all, I just dont think its my kind of OS and I'd like something that skews a bit more away from the windows side of things.

 I've gotten my average draw down to ~8W. On my 65Wh battery this equates to about 8hrs of battery life under light use.
 x86_64 systems only please
 ​
 My setup and tweaks:
 - Arch Linux (also obtained on Mint)
 - Razer Blade 15 (2021 Base)
 - dGPU powered off
 - auto-cpufreq for power optimizations
 ​
 I'd like to get it down to ~5W, but idk if that's feasible. The 7-8W breakpoint appears quite difficult to pass.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello. I want to ask about a specific scenario:
 Lets say I got a flash drive, I wrote 10 files there, deleted 2 of them, so 8 are present at the moment. We know files don't just get deleted, it's just that the OS forgets that they're there and you can always retrieve deleted files unless they're damaged (overwritten).
 My question is, how would I be able to copy all 10 files including 8 present ones and 2 deleted ones from that flash drive to another so that I would be able to recover those 2 deleted ones on the second flash drive?
 My best guess is "rsync -vuar /source/directory /destination/directory" but I don't know if it would be able to copy the deleted ones too. Please tell if that would work and if not, which command should I use instead?

 Dear community,
 I'm Piotr from Customrombay.org, and I would like to bring some exciting news for all Linux enthusiasts.
 Today, support for displaying information about Linux distributions on phones was added to Customrombay.org. Now, you can easily compare the availability of custom Android ROMs, custom recoveries, and Linux distributions between devices.
 What is Customrombay?
 Customrombay is the largest database of custom ROMs, with support for over 550 devices. Our goal is to support as many custom ROMs and devices as possible and provide quality information about them.
 Contributing
 Contributing to Customrombay is highly encouraged, as it helps the project grow. More information is available on the contributing page.
 Open source
 Customrombay.org is completely open source. You can find us on GitHub. Our code is licensed under the MPL-2.0 license.
 Phones with notable Linux support
 For now, only information about Ubuntu Touch support is available on our website. We plan to extend that to PostmarketOS and NixOS. But which devices does Ubuntu Touch support? For example those:
  
OnePlus 6 (enchilada)
 OnePlus 6T (fajita)
 OnePlus One (bacon)
 Xiaomi Poco F1 (beryllium)
 Xiaomi POCO X3 (surya)
 Sony Xperia X (suzu)
 Google Pixel 3a (sargo)
 ASUS Zenfone Max Pro M1 (X00TD)

 1) Secure Boot. In order to activate the Hibernate settings, I have to disable Secure Boot. I don't really feel comfortable doing this, because I have read conflicting opinions on this. On one hand I read that it's good and recommended for security issues and on the hand I read it's just a propaganda term coined by Microsoft. I have no idea whom I should believe…]]></summary>

ReactOS 是一个开源的操作系统，旨在复制微软的 Windows，可以不加修改地运行许多 Windows 应用程序。ReactOS 的上一次更新是在 2021 年 12 月。此前它的发布计划是每三个月释出一个新版本，但自从 0.4.14 之后就再无动静。面对用户的疑问，该项目发文称其还活着，只是之后的版本发布会根据质量而不是数量。新的发布规则是“一个新版本要达到 `发布’ 状态，需要有合理的低回归量（不超过 20个）”。但他们并没有给出下一个版本预计发布的时间，不过你可以随时尝试其每夜构建版本。


消息来源：ReactOS



老王点评：其实，没事发个新版本表示活着，至少是给社区一些信心的做法。




WhatsApp 关闭了基于 Electron 的桌面应用

当 WhatsApp 处于早期开发阶段时，开发者创建了一个基于 Electron JavaScript 框架的桌面应用程序，它在 Windows 和 macOS 上都能使用。大约四周前，这个桌面应用程序的主屏幕上出现了一个倒计时器，宣布其即将关闭。WhatsApp 让用户切换到其原生应用程序上，新的原生应用程序已经稳定运行了一年左右。

老王点评：有了原生应用，谁还用 Electron 的呀。




GitHub DDoS 攻击了一个重要的开源项目小网站

一个 GCC 核心的开源算术库 GMP 项目所使用的服务器遭受到了大量的来自 GitHub 的 IP 的连接。无奈之下，该项目只能封禁了数百个微软的 IP 地址。微软发现这是一个被复刻了 700 多次的存储库上的 Actions 工作流导致的。一位 GitHub 用户更新了 FFmpeg-Builds 项目中的一个脚本，该脚本从 gmplib.org 提取内容。这种活动应该不是恶意的，但 GMP 有限的基础设施无法应对这个量级的并发请求。这并不是第一次有软件项目因为繁重的流量需求而喊出被 DDoS。


消息来源：The Register



老王点评：这个事情里面没有主动的恶意行为者，但是 GitHub 这么大体量，稍有不慎对其它微小的基础设施都是毁灭性打击，所以，微软应该对其基础设施和应用更加慎重一些。]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[近日，全国多家高校发布公告称，7月1日起开始暂停使用微信支付，原因是微信支付将收取0.6%的手续费，而此前，微信支付对教育场景下的支付服务一直免收服务费。


据不完全统计，目前已有西北大学、南京理工大学、江苏师范大学等多所高校均发布了类似的停用微信支付公告。


6月27日，西北大学发布的公告称，“因腾讯公司微信支付将于 7 月 1 日起对校园场景用户进行精细化管理，除收学费外，其它收费均会受到限制并收取 0.6% 的手续费，决定对校内一卡通用户暂停提供微信扫码支付服务。”


周口师范学院也表示，接到财付通支付科技有限公司通知后，学校多方沟通并未收到明显效果，为减轻不必要的财政负担，决定自6月29日起停用校内微信支付场景应用，包括财务处收取的各类费用、校园一卡通充值、教材费缴纳、教职员工生活区网络交通费、学生宿舍空调电费、商业用房电费缴费等。


针对此事，微信团队表示，由于我们对高校生活服务场景支付费率问题处理不周，造成大家的困扰，在此向广大学校及师生致歉。请大家放心，在校园非盈利场景，我们会持续保持零费率优惠政策。


此次调整的本意是为了对费率实施更加精细化的优惠措施，但很显然过于简单粗暴引起误解，我们深表歉意，即刻修正，后续我们将继续优化与高校的沟通流程，加强合作，助力校园数字化的持续发展。


此外，据记者了解，针对教育场景，云闪付、支付宝、银行等渠道等尚未出现支付费用上涨的问题，仍可正常使用。


博通咨询金融分析师王蓬博对记者表示，校园场景总体来看一直是被当做公益类场景，监管也一直延续对这类场景的支付费率优惠政策，并且从2021年开始也一直号召对中小微企业和公益类场景减费让利。


他表示，由于商业发展和政策等多方面原因，账户侧数字钱包分润模式种类多样，此前对于一般类场景才能够达到0.6%的手续费费率，对于公益类场景一直是0费率，此次微信支付对校园场景提价，说明微信本身依靠金融科技版块盈利的压力较大。因此，建议微信支付自身做好社会责任和盈利之间的平衡，目前微信可以依靠高粘性获取用户，但年轻用户群体的使用习惯也有可能改变。


记者注意到，中国银行卡收单市场的费率一直处于较低水平，导致收单机构的利润率较低，受到近年来严监管的持续，支付收单机构的合规成本也在逐渐增加，也让银行卡收单机构们在“跳码”事件后，开始提高特定场景的收单费率。


此外，腾讯最新发布的财报显示，腾讯金融科技板块增长较为乏力，2022年，腾讯金融科技及企业服务业务年度的收入同比仅增长3%，至1771亿元。

WhatsApp 是流行的手机通讯平台，在许多国家都很受欢迎。用户通常通过 Play 商店或 App Store 中的移动应用访问它。然而，WhatsApp 从未推出任何适用于 Linux 的官方桌面客户端。

尽管你可以使用浏览器访问 WhatsApp，这是从任何桌面（包括 Linux）访问消息的官方方式。

一个新的非官方 WhatsApp Flatpak 桌面应用出现了，你可以无缝地使用它进行通信。

那么，这个 GTK 应用有哪些功能？

“Linux 版 WhatsApp” 的功能



借助这款新的桌面应用，Linux 桌面用户可以在他们最喜欢的桌面环境中享受 WhatsApp 的所有熟悉功能。现在，你可以在 Linux 发行版上轻松访问所有功能，例如发送消息、共享媒体文件以及进行语音和视频通话。

“Linux 版 WhatsApp” 应用还提供键盘快捷键，确保应用内的无缝导航和交互。使用此应用，你可以放大和缩小以仔细查看图像和文本，或切换到全屏模式以获得无干扰的聊天体验。该应用还包括一个系统托盘图标，即使在应用最小化时也可以快速访问和通知。

此外，你可以自定义应用以满足你的喜好。通过按 Alt+H，你可以轻松显示或隐藏标题栏，从而更好地控制工作区。该应用还支持系统语言的本地化，确保你可以轻松地与世界各地的朋友和家人进行交流。



Linux 版 WhatsApp 应用的一项值得注意的功能是支持系统语言的拼写检查。要启用此功能，你必须安装相应的词典，例如美国英语的 hunspell-en_us 包。

技术细节

如果你想知道，它不是一个 Electron 应用。它是使用原生 C++ 编写的，确保了最佳的性能和安全性。它依赖于各种免费和开源库，例如 intltool、gtkmm-3.0、webkit2gtk-4.0、ayatana-appindicator3-0.1、libcanberra 以及用于拼写检查的 libhunspell（可选）。

你可以从 GitHub 上的源码了解有关此应用的更多信息。

安装

首先，你必须为你的 Linux 发行版设置 Flatpak 和 Flathub。使用 本指南 来设置。

安装后，运行以下命令进行安装。

flatpak install com.github.eneshecan.WhatsAppForLinux


你可以在应用列表中找到该应用。

运行应用

打开应用后，设置与 WhatsApp 网页类似。打开手机的 WhatsApp 应用并扫描应用中的二维码。这样就完成了。



请注意，这是一个非官方的应用。因此，请谨慎使用。你还可以查看 GitHub 以获取有关此应用的更多详细信息。

Yesterday I found out that the RHEL 8 Exam was discontinued and I felt dumb for wasting time restudying the old material. Long story short, are the major and/or critical differences between RHEL 8 and RHEL 9 learning material?

九十年前，苏联微生物学家格奥尔基·高斯将零点五克燕麦片放入一百毫升水中，煮十分钟，制成培养基后进行过滤，再加水稀释一同倒入平底试管里，最后将五只草履虫放进试管。一周之中，他观察到草履虫数量在缓慢增长一段时间后开始快速疯狂繁殖，到了第三天，数量达到顶点。然而，随着食物逐渐耗尽，种群数量开始下降直到趋于零。这一年高斯二十四岁，他用不起眼的草履虫发现了至今令人类思索的一条规律：生物会在疯狂生长到充满整个培养皿，以致拥挤到触碰器皿边缘后，开始自我消耗，直至殆尽。
那么，人类是否也与草履虫一样？我们是否已触碰到人类这个物种繁殖量的边缘？如果是，未来应该怎么办？
这精彩的故事和发人深思的追问来自美国作家查尔斯·C. 曼恩的新著《巫师与先知：两种环保科学观如何帮助人类应对生态危机》。作者发挥其科学记者的优势，采访大量专家与学者的同时，还收集了相关领域丰富的科学数据，再结合实际走访，与全世界各地环保主义者、政治家、农业人员和官员面谈，写出了一本难能可贵的环境保护论战史。全书以立场截然不同但又都关心人类前途命运的两位代表人物为线索，通过详细讲述他们的生平与贡献，串联起当今世界环保主义与科学主义人士百年来的探索与困惑。作者将他们归纳为先知派和巫师派。
环保主义与科学主义
先知派的代表威廉·沃格特在我国的知名度一定比不上《寂静的春天》的作者蕾切尔·卡森。但卡森的名著却是受到沃格特《生存之路》一书启发而写就的，尽管两人年龄仅相差五岁。沃格特出生于1902年，是现代环境保护运动基本理念的制定者。他倡导“世界末日环境论”，认为不断增长的人口数量以及不会降低的消费水平最终将压垮地球的生态系统。富裕不是成就，而是不断付出代价的向地球的索取。消减！消减！是他…]]></summary>

英国著名学者、马克思主义文化批评家特里·伊格尔顿（Terry Eagleton）的《论文化》（原书名Culture，2016）虽然只是一部不到十万字的小书，但其研究议题的深度、论述视角之开阔、批判性观点的尖锐与深刻都使其具有厚重之感。看起来是宏大抽象的主题和自由随意的思想散论，实际上在观念分析、历史语境中的意涵溯源和现实政治中的思想剖析等方面均表现出对复杂性和争议性议题的深刻思辨功力，在论述中对尼采、弗洛伊德、马克思、伯克、赫尔德、维特根斯坦、T. S. 艾略特和王尔德等人的观点的精准讨论也使该书具有以“文化”观念为中心的思想史色彩。而伊格尔顿的流畅、恣肆不羁的文风也使阅读带有了另类快感。对我来说，由于同时在阅读弗里茨·斯特恩（Fritz Richard Oskar Stern）的《非自由主义的失败：论现代德国政治文化》（孟钟捷译，商务印书馆，2015年5月），正在思考的是著名的近现代史难题“德国问题”中文化与政治的复杂关系、权力与文化之争、文明与文化之争、从文化政治走向政治文化的路径等议题，因此对伊格尔顿的《论文化》更多关注的是其中文化与政治的论述。在当下的思想与学术场域中，无论我们对伊格尔顿的理论体系及具体论点有何不同看法，他的鲜活与敏锐的批判性气质仍然是很有感染力的。
作者在“序言”中讲了本书的论述方法：鉴于“文化”这个概念的多层次使其很难被高度统一地展开描述，因此他采取的是围绕“文化”这个主题的多侧面论述。从全书内容议题来说，该书第一章首先讨论了“文化”与“文明”在概念、内涵和使用语境等方面的联系与区别。这一部分在我看来非常适合作为文明史与文化史导论课程的开篇语，可以启发学生从一开始就以开阔的观念与语言学视野思考历史叙事体系的建构与核心概念的复杂联系。…]]></summary>

 I think come from a very uncommon background. I'm an Econ Undergrad that recently got interested in understanding how Linux kernel works. Could someome tell me from where should I start studying? Maybe give me some sort of roadmap. 
 For context, I have some good experience with coding (as a hobby, 3+ years), but mostly python and webdev stuff. I have been studying C and C++, Data Structures and Algos, and I have very basic understanding of Memory, CPU, etc. 
 My goal is to understand how kernel optimizations are made in High Frequency Trading firms.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So I let me start like this.
 I had an old Lenovo Notebook lay around and I thought about making a bit of use out of it. I wanted to explore new teritories and well make something practical. 
 I'm an old windows veteran (since 3.11) and also early Android (with alt OSs like Cynogen/Lineage) user so i'm not completley new to change of OS and I'm used to tinker around. Also some old Suse and Knoppix as live CD but that's a whole different thing.
 What I want to do is:
 - hook the notebook up to the network
 - let a linux distrubtion be the OS
 - run Jellyfin/Kodi or an alternativ to hook up my quite big digital CD collection into a streaming setup to use it as spotify alternativ 
 So I installed Fedora Server, got PTSD Flashbacks to MS-DOS and said hell no I need an GUI. SO I installed Fedora Workstation.
 Rat Head enters the chat, does what we all know.
 He is the point, I don't want to go away from Microsoft to then Popo love without lubricants by Red Hat.
 I thought about using Mint, I like the Cinamon GUI they use. (I know I could theoretical tinker cinamon onto fedora even I don't know yet how). 
 But I'm not sure how good Mint is for what I want to use it. So.. help. please.
 Thank you for your pation with a beginner.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi,
 today i talk with a friend and we are discussing about the pros and cons of the use of Linux Mint vs Windows.
 He tell me that for him it's not possible to switch to linux, in particular to Mint because is a simple hobby made from some unknow people... and he describe it as a : Hobbyware...
 He concluded with... yo uare doing banking and other sensible work with this OS? I tell... yes!
 And he tell me that i'm mad, and that windows is not very secure, but i'm doing very bad use of my pc because linux mint is not secure (he repeat... it's only an hobby from someone into a garage...)
 You opinion about that?
 Yes in the last three month i'm using linux mint and every day i use it more and more... and i'm very happy.
 I know behind mint there is not a corporate or a company, and this for some people is wrong, some prefer microsoft and apple because the give the feel of "business" = "reliable".
 But it's so bad use a distro like mint for every day pc use?

 Maybe I am mistaken and there is already feature like that but last time i checked there is no such feature.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have questions on the security of the flatpak apps or packages, compared to the native Linux distribution versions. 
 How long usually the updates are delayed, from when an application update becomes available in a linux distribution?
 How trusted are the package maintainers in either case? Like, for the distribution packages, there are probably reviews of shipped software to some extent. Flathub can be like Pypy, with many malicious submissions nobody checks. Any random person could upload a package!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey iam a bloody beginner, but interested in the concept of linux. I installed the ubuntu server on a usb stick to clear the ssd of a friend and to save his data. I know that stuff like this can be done with any distro, but ubuntu seemed a bit heavy for the simple stuff, which I have used it for. Iam looking for a beginner friendly lightweight distro, which has good community support. It would be nice if it has a clean UI (Iam not a big fan of the look of puppy linux). 
 Additionally Iam looking for a distro that only has a console, like the ubuntu server, but more leightweight. 
 Do you have any reccomendations for the two distros iam looking for?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[First, you/the users still get the software. It may not be as easy to compile to a 1:1 copy, but it never was perfectly easy. Red Hat never offered binary packages outside their own RHEL distribution channels.
 RHEL's unique value proposition is being well tested, stable, and standards compliant, with bug fixes delivered ASAP. Red Hat invests lots of money, time, effort to deliver this in RHEL, whereas the RHEL clones don't offer added value beyond being cheaper. I find it hard to argue: 1) any user has a right to a continuous stream of updates, especially where 2) that user is seeking to wipe away any return on Red Hat's investment.
 Second, Red Hat is a business, and we need to stop pretending every FOSS business should be some quasi-public trust. Red Hat should do what's good for Red Ha…]]></summary>

Lately I’ve been playing around on Linux virtual machines (specifically Ubuntu Studio) and I’m seriously thinking of migrating my Asus Zenbook with a. RTX 3080gpu and 32gb of ram over fully to Linux. 
 My main uses for this computer are creating and programming, both which Linux seems to excel at more than windows plus I love the ease of use of Linux. Is there a reason not to switch to Linux? Would I be wasting my hardware? Thanks

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[cowsay 是一个有趣的小型 Linux 命令行实用程序，它有各种使用方式。以下是几个示例。


如果你想的话，Linux 终端可以是一个有趣的地方。

当然，终端一般用在严肃的场合，但你可以使用 有趣的 Linux 命令 来娱乐自己。

cowsay 就是其中之一。它可以在终端上显示一头牛。



cowsay 的一个特点是，如果与其他命令组合使用，它可以用于一些 “严肃的场合”。比如，在共享的 Linux 服务器上使用它来显示 “每日消息”，以供多个用户查看。

听起来有趣吗？是时候喂养安装一个了。

安装 Cowsay

cowsay 是一个受欢迎的工具，它可以在大多数 Linux 发行版的软件仓库中找到。

要在 Debian 和 Ubuntu 系统上安装 cowsay，请打开终端并运行：

sudo apt install cowsay


对于 Fedora，请使用：

sudo dnf install cowsay


在基于 Arch Linux 的发行版中，请使用：

sudo pacman -S cowsay


使用 Cowsay

顾名思义，这是一头以 ASCII 艺术展示的牛，能输出输入的文本。默认情况下，cowsay 提供了几个选项来调整这头 ASCII 牛的外观和样式。

普通的 cowsay

cowsay <文本>


这将在牛讲话的气泡中打印你提供的任何文本。



或者，你可以使用管道重定向，将另一个命令（比如 echo）的输出作为 cowsay 的输入。

echo "Hello" | cowsay


贪婪的牛

这里，牛的眼睛看起来有点贪婪，它是美元符号。

cowsay -g <消息>




使用特殊字符作为眼睛

你可以使用 -e 选项，然后提供你希望作…]]></summary>

We raised a seed round, then spent a year building templates of reports for startups.
After a year of building our product we tried to monetise and failed. Our free users weren’t willing to pay us money for individual reports.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The GPL-3 itself allows you to include additional terms according to Section 7:
  
“Additional permissions” are terms that supplement the terms of this License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions. Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall be treated as though they were included in this License...
  
So as long as the additional terms do not conflict with GPL-3, you may add your own terms. In fact, LGPL works like this. LGPL-3 is essentially word-per-word GPL-3 + additional terms which is an exercise of Section 7 of the GPL-3.
 Section 7 makes GPL-3 a modular, base license for other people to adapt with their own terms as long as it is compatible with GPL.
 You will still call your license GPL-3. The additional terms will be placed in a separate file:
  
If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you must place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the additional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating where to find the applicable terms.
  
I can imagine an additional term to combat Red Hat's style paywall to go something like this:
 This program should not be subjected to an agreement that penalizes the licensee from exercising their rights under this license.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[红帽认为 RHEL 克隆品是对开源公司的“真正威胁”

前两天，红帽 宣布 其企业发行版 RHEL 的源代码将只公开发布在 CentOS Stream 上，其直接后果是社区将无法直接获得 RHEL 的精确源代码。这显然给 1:1 复制 RHEL 的下游发行版，如 AlmaLinux、Rocky Linux 等造成了 阻碍。面对社区批评，红帽高管最近撰文反驳，指出对他们愤怒的人“要么来自于那些不愿为生产 RHEL 需要付出的时间、精力和资源付费的人，要么来自那些因为自己的利益而想要重新打包它的人”。他认为 AlmaLinux 等“下游重新构建者没有价值”，“简单地重新打包，并进行原样转售，没有增加任何的价值，还让开源软件的生产变得不可持续”，并且表示，他们“没有义务让重新构建者的工作更加容易”。更严重的是，他还指控这是一种对开源的“威胁”，“如果是仅仅重新构建代码，而不对现有代码增加价值或进行任何修改，对于所有开源公司来说，这才是真正的威胁。这对开源来说是一个真正的威胁，有可能将开源重新变回到只适用于业余爱好者和黑客的活动。”


消息来源：红帽



老王点评：一方面受限于 GPL 而不得不公开源代码，另外一方面又千方百计提高获得源代码的麻烦程度，并反过来指责那些依据 GPL 而获得源代码的人是“威胁” —— 说实话，“威胁”这个词我记得当年微软也这样说过。曾经红帽砍掉 CentOS 项目，而用滚动变化的 CentOS Stream 替代时，我认为这对 RHEL 的发展是有益的，面对很多“误解”，也曾出面帮他们做过一些澄清。但是现在红帽终于图穷匕见，认为从 RHEL 源代码构建的“克隆品”是一个“威胁”。我想说，你利用开源代码构建的 RHEL，没有资格说同样根据许可证获得源代码构建发行版的人是“威胁”！另外，卫 Sir 今天的 撰文 对此做了更深入的剖析，值得一看。




微软考虑将 Windows 转移到云端

在 FTC 诉微软收购动视暴雪听证会上，一份被公开的微软 2022 年 6 月的内部演示文稿中，微软讨论了在 Windows 365 的基础上实现从云端到任何设备的完整 Windows 操作系统串流。Windows 365 是一项将完整版本的 Windows 串流到设备的服务，目前仅提供给商业客户，但微软已经将其深度整合到 Windows 11 中。未来的更新将包括 Windows 365 Boot，它将使 Windows 11 设备在启动时直接登录到云 PC 实例，而不是本地版本的 Windows。

老王点评：如果 Windows 都变成云端的了，那么是不是 Linux 桌面就有希望变成“第二大”桌面系统了？ 😉




手机跟踪软件 LetMeSpy 称其被黑客窃取了大量信息

LetMeSpy 是一款手机监控应用程序，被用于家长控制或员工监控。这类手机监控应用程序也被称为跟踪软件或配偶软件，通常在未经本人同意或不知情的情况下对某人的手机进行物理访问而植入。一旦被植入，LetMeSpy 就会默默地将手机的短信、通话记录和精确的位置数据上传到其服务器，让植入该应用程序的人能够实时跟踪该人。该公司称，一名黑客窃取了 LetMeSpy 从电子邮件、电话号码和账户上截获的信息。入侵的黑客表示已经夺取了该公司域名的广泛访问权，并暗示他们删除了 LetMeSpy 存储在服务器上的数据库。同一天晚些时候，一份被黑的数据库的副本也出现在网上。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[从商业化工具开始的探索
很久以前，我曾经试图用一个工具整合各种需求，即所谓「All in One」，结果却是让工具内部变得臃肿和笨重，后来还是逐渐放弃了。
现在，我做笔记用的是 Obsidian 和 Notion，任务管理用滴答清单，剪藏管理用 Cubox（都是少数派商店里面的好货）。这样将需求拆解到不同工具之后，很多复杂脚本被现成功能取代，工作确实简单了一些。但相应的代价则是需要在工具之间跳转，而它们的协作缺乏了一些「灵性」。
针对这种问题，市场上出现了许多基于 API 的自动化平台，试图让用户以较低门槛打通不同应用。这其中的行业领先者包括 Zapier 和 IFTTT 等，都是少数派读者耳熟能详的，在少数派上也有不少关的深度教程，例如：
  
经过检索，我发现在 AI 兴起之后，很多这类服务都快速添加了调用 OpenAI API 的功能。但是它们有一个共同的缺点（或者是我自己的缺点……），就是太贵了。可以对比一下此类产品的价格：
产品
                价格
            
Zapier
                免费用户每月 100 次任务。最低升级价格 $20/月，含 750 次任务
            
IFTTT
                免费用户可保存 3 个自动化（Applets）。含有 AI 功能的升级方案升级 $5/月
            
集简云
                免费用户每月 500 次执行。升级一年 ￥1990，每月可执行 1500 次
            
HiFlow（腾讯轻联）
                免费用户每月 1000 次执行。升级一年 ￥980，每月 3000 次
            
原则上，我是非常支持为互联网企业的创新功能付费的，但是日常用户的需求并没有强烈到能支撑这种价格。特别是 Zapier，已经像是「轻奢品」的范畴了。
本文中，我将介绍自己如何搭建开源、可自建的自动化工具 n8n，并演示几个真实用例。在此基础上，我将对用自动化工具辅助工作的未来提出一些展望，以及就个人如何跟进这新的一轮「产业革命」提出些小小看法。
在经历一系列摸索之后，我最终找到了一个可用且免费的替代品——n8n。
n8n 是一个开源的自动化控制台。它具有设计简洁的图形界面，可以非常清晰地展示数据在各种服务之间流动的过程。对于入门用户，n8n 提供了丰富的模板，也有活跃的社区支持。

n8n 提供官方托管服务，定价也不便宜。但得益于开源属性，可以比较方便地在自己的 NAS 或 VPS 上部署，从而不需要任何额外开销。
用 Docker Compose 安装 n8n
n8n 的安装方式有多种选择，我选择的是 Docker Compose 方案，这也是一种比较容易上手的方案。（下面的步骤假定读者掌握基本的终端操作，且已经安装好 Docker。）
[ 编注：我们之前会员文章介绍过的 YunoHost 也可以快速安装 n8n。]

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[本快速教程解释了安装和使用 GNOME Boxes 以及创建虚拟机的步骤，以及一些提示和故障排除。


虚拟化是使用抽象硬件层运行虚拟实例（而不是实际实例）的过程。通俗地说，它允许你同时安装和运行多个操作系统（Linux、Windows）。

虚拟机 是一个模拟操作系统，它运行在另一个操作系统之上，并使用与主机相同的硬件和存储空间。虽然，你可以控制可以分配给虚拟机的共享内存或空间量。

有多种软件可用于创建虚拟机，例如 Virtual Box、KVM、Hyper-V、VMWare player 和 GNOME Boxes。

但老实说，它们中的大多数使用起来都很复杂，有时还不够稳定。GNOME Boxes 是另一个自由开源的软件，它非常易于使用，通过抽象出大量选项让你可以轻松创建和管理虚拟机。

安装 GNOME Boxes

如果你正在运行 Fedora 的 GNOME 定制版，你应该已经安装了它。但是，对于 Ubuntu、Linux Mint、Kubuntu 和其他发行版，你只需运行以下命令即可将其安装到你的系统中。

sudo apt install gnome-boxes


通过 Flatpak

它也可以通过 Flatpak 包获得。我会推荐你使用这个版本。首先，使用 本指南 在系统中安装 Flatpak，然后从终端运行以下命令进行安装。

flatpak install flathub org.gnome.Boxes


使用 GNOME Boxes 创建虚拟机

从应用菜单启动 GNOME Boxes。

要创建虚拟机，你需要要虚拟化的操作系统的镜像（*.ISO）。

你可以从发行版的官方下载页面下载任何操作系统 ISO 镜像。对于本指南，我使用的是 Pop!_OS，这是一个优秀的 Linux 发行版。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[6月28日，菜鸟集团宣布推出自营的品质快递业务：菜鸟速递。菜鸟速递历经六年打造，由服务天猫超市的配送业务升级为全国快递网络，主打半日达、当次日达、送货上门和夜间揽收等品质服务，在全国近三百城提供晚到、破损必赔，不上门必赔，在途拦截和在途更改目的地等五个100%承诺。


据了解，菜鸟速递是适应市场上对高质量快递需要而生，主要聚焦“菜鸟自营、品质快递、好用不贵”，服务上对标行业最优，价格上兼具性价比，并按照时效和重量提供丰富的产品矩阵，覆盖大件、中小件和微小件等全重量级包裹。


“中国快递市场发展得足够快、也足够大，需要物流行业提供多层次的供给，菜鸟希望打造更具性价比的品质服务，满足商家不断出现的新需求。”菜鸟集团CEO万霖表示。


六年前，由于市场上高质量快递供给不足，尤其是高性价比品质快递服务的稀缺，菜鸟速递开始着手搭建落地配网络，支撑天猫超市等阿里内部自营业务的发展，逐步将消费者体验提升到行业领先水平。


六年来，市场对品质快速服务的需求不断攀升，但供给持续紧缺。菜鸟的这张落地配网络也引发市场关注，不断有商家提出希望菜鸟开放自营物流能力。随着菜鸟搭建全国性的干线运输、转运网络，全面将落地配网络升级为具有跨区域配送、揽派一体的全国性快递网络，菜鸟速递正式推出。


6月28日，在全球智慧物流峰会现场，认养一头牛、青岛啤酒、添可、欧珀莱、盒马和银泰百货等客户与菜鸟速递签约，意味着菜鸟速递已全面向市场开放。同时菜鸟速递也接入菜鸟供应链，与菜鸟仓组成了优选仓配半日达服务，为商家提供仓配一体化的品质服务，提升消费者体验。


据介绍，乳业龙头伊利在天猫上的部分旗舰店去年开始试用菜鸟速递服务，物流问题投诉下降30%，大促物流成本下降30%，退货率也少了一倍，且老客户复购占比提升了10%。


快递行业专家赵小敏认为，菜鸟速递的推出，实质上是响应市场的需求，“菜鸟速递对快递市场来说是一种有益补充，消费市场容量足够大，还有广阔的发展空间，并不会与通达系等经济型快递形成直接竞争关系。”


菜鸟速递是今年菜鸟重点建设的国内物流业务产品。菜鸟还在加快国际快递和海外本地快递的建设。据悉，未来十年，菜鸟将着力建设一张全球领先的智慧物流网络，打造国内、跨境和海外本地等三大长链物流网络，同时形成末端驿站、物流地产和物流科技等三大短链业务。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[《繁花 : 批注本》，金宇澄著，沈宏非批注，姜庆共排版，长江文艺出版社，2023年6月出版，682页，98.00元

《繁花》出了一个新版。金宇澄著，沈宏非批注，姜庆共排版。排版先生上封面，罕见，但也因此看得出，沈宏非的批注有多激情，搞得姜先生一会让朱色批注在墨色正文间横躺，一会又竖插一个对话框，夹批与侧批齐飞，段批共尾批一色，也算印刷史上无前例的文本。
当然，批注本的好看，还不在皮相。金宇澄不响，沈宏非狂批。沈爷不仅充分展现自己食神本色，遇到“菜泡饭”“虾籽鲞鱼”“烂糊三鲜汤”“糯米双酿团”“西湖莼菜羹”这样的地方美食，立马展现专业知识和个人权威，而且一手一脚提溜进汁水丰富的历史人文，比如拾玖章提到“走油蹄髈”，沈爷先讲了蹄髈做法，又补上花絮：“‘文革’后落实政策，大笔钱财突然从天而降，世面却无车无房无奢侈品可购、无股票可炒，唯有猛吃，鱼翅、鲍鱼登场之前，‘走油蹄髈’‘全鸡全鸭’一度成为发还抄家财物者‘报复社会’之首选，曾有人日进一簋，月余暴卒。”
跟“食”关联度最高的“色”事，沈爷更是手到擒来如数家珍。金爷小说中，让年轻读者略感门槛的是，对五六十年代穿着和时尚的表达，沈爷凭着半个世纪在色相上的造诣，一一圈画，即便我们这种有点阅历的南方读者，亦大开眼界。
小说第六章，梅瑞告诉康总，她妈终于离婚了，在家清理衣服，织锦缎棉袄，罩衫，横贡缎棉袄，灯芯绒裤子，卡其裤子，两用衫，春秋呢大衣，法兰绒短大衣，派克大衣，哔叽长裤，舍维尼长裤，中长纤维两用衫，朝阳格衬衫，泡泡纱裙子，腈纶开司米三翻领，湖绉荷叶滚边裙，蓝棠皮鞋，江青裙，列宁装等等等等，沈宏非都以饕餮的快乐，色色批注。看好了，“斜纹布西服装大翻领”，“中横布带一根，束起来显腰身”，“‘集各朝女服之大成’设计的开襟V字领连衫裙，裙下摆至小腿中部，有使其（如中山装）成为女性‘国服’之意”，而且，这些食色交融的批注和老金的原文辉映成…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[《天赐之日》，[荷兰]高罗佩著，张凌译，上海译文出版社2023年4月出版，184页，45.00元

众所周知，荷兰汉学家高罗佩（Robert Hans van Gulik，1910-1967）以其融中国公案与西方侦探于一体的《大唐狄公案》闻名世界，该系列悬疑小说是以唐代政治家狄仁杰（字怀英，630-700）为主角，作者虚构了他破案、断案的故事。但很少有人知道，1964 年，也即高氏去世前三年，他还出版了《天赐之日》（The Given Day）——一部几乎完全摒弃狄公系列小说创作风格的黑帮犯罪小说，尽管依旧有一个以正压邪的结局和令男主人公心旌摇曳的美女配角，但作者对故事人物、场景、题材、结构等均作了较大创新，正如荷兰小说家与评论家扬威廉（Janwillem Van de Wetering，1931-2008）在“后记”中所云，此书是高罗佩试图将其“荷兰性”与他在远东接触到的禅学调和起来的尝试。至于这一尝试是否成功，众说纷纭、见仁见智。本文意在展现《天赐之日》对狄公系列小说的新变，并进一步剖析高氏离开狄公赐予的舒适圈，涉足一个从未尝试过的新领域的原因。
相较于《大唐狄公案》，《天赐之日》并非探案小说，而是较为典型的西方犯罪小说，一般来讲，犯罪小说的创作宗旨在于塑造社会共同的道德体系，用紧张刺激的阅读体验、推理解谜的思维乐趣和惩恶扬善的正义主题引导人们遵守法律、和谐相处。但《天赐之日》突破了这一传统主旨，意在彰显更高精神层面的超拔。为达到这一目的，高公首先挣脱了狄公的束缚，为《天赐之日》带来了诸多具有鲜明西方性和现代性的新变。
首先是主人公之变。《天赐之日》由唐武周时期的著名政治家狄仁杰变身为前殖民地也即荷属东印度政府官员约翰·亨德里克斯，前者是满腹经纶、清正廉洁、才德卓绝的“斗南一人”；后者则是爪哇某城的地区副主管和巡回法官，二战期间失去妻女及一切的日军战俘，战后身无长物的老…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It all started on my birthday, when my mother gave me a low-end notebook for studying. At first I thought it was unnecessary because I already have a high-end computer, but this innocent wrong gift literally changed my life.
 For being low-end, Windows 10 was running very poorly, and I decided to install Ubuntu just for testing, and man... how freakin awesome Linux is! At first it's kinda hard because you don't even know cd or apt , but the more you try stuff, the more you learn how to do things efficiently, and even more important, you learn how to actually solve problems by yourself.
 Yesterday I changed GNOME for KDE, and holy ****, it's a new world of customization, and I just can't get enough of this feeling of exploring a whole new land. Even when I get frustrated after failing multiple times trying to do something, the thirst for overcoming challenges seems endless!
 I don't know if I'm being crazy for thinking that exploring an OS is thrilling, but I just feel like an 7 years old kid learning how to do things on a computer for the first time, but in a very depth/technical way (at least in my head lol).
 After this awesome experience, I finally decided to go for a computing college, and I just can't thank my mother enough for giving me a shi*** computer lol. I don't know a single person who uses Linux, so I figured I might be better understood here
 tl;dr Linux just set my life course

 k-means is one of the most widely-used algorithms to cluster data. However, it has several limitations: a) it requires the use of L2 distance for efficient clustering, which also b) restricts the data you're clustering to be vectors, and c) doesn't require the means to be datapoints in the dataset.
 Unlike in k-means, the k-medoids problem requires cluster centers to be actual datapoints, which permits greater interpretability of your cluster centers. k-medoids also works better with arbitrary distance metrics, so your clustering can be more robust to outliers if you're …]]></summary>

Endless is an open-source mobile app that curates posts from your favorite websites in one place with a common interface. The application uses custom extractors specifically written for each website. This way you can endlessly scroll through posts and save the ones you like without having to deal with ads.
With the Endless server I am hosting you can also upvote and leave comments on posts without creating an account! With random tokens linked to your actions you basically use your device as your account and undo your actions in the future without spoiling your identity.
I hope to add more extractors in the future. Feel free to install the app and check out the extractors yourself or contribute to the project! I always love to hear your comments and feedback.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[你在“发行版快闪”中做错了什么？你能做得更好吗？当然可以。在这里，我们告诉你如何做。


“发行版快闪Distro hopping” 是指经常尝试新的 Linux 发行版，以寻找乐趣或找到适合你的完美发行版的习惯。

毕竟，有着 数百种 Linux 发行版，而且时不时就有新的版本出现。你可能会担心错过它们，而去尝试 Linux 社区的最新潮流。

无论你为何这样做，不管你喜欢与否，人们会犯下一些错误，这让“发行版快闪”的体验变得糟糕。

这些错误是什么？让我带你一一了解：

1、不进行备份



嗯，你想要更换发行版，由于过于兴奋，你毫不犹豫就切换了。

但是，如果你没有备份重要的、经常访问的数据，你可能需要重新配置系统和组织你需要的数据。

所以，如果你有备份，无论你做什么，你需要的数据始终可访问，并帮助你在发行版之间快速的跳来跳去。

2、不检查显卡的驱动支持



用户常常忽略发行版与其系统中的显卡的兼容性，而抱怨发行版有问题。

你必须确保你的发行版对你的显卡有开箱即用的支持。

如果你像我一样有一块英伟达显卡，你应该只选择提供带有英伟达支持的 ISO，或在启动菜单中内置了该支持的发行版。

例如，在 Linux Mint 上你需要 安装英伟达驱动。虽然大部分情况下这是一个简单且没什么麻烦的过程，但并不是每个人都愿意为之付出努力。你也可以选择 Pop!_OS 或 Ubuntu，它们默认情况下与英伟达显卡兼容良好。

3、抱有过高期望



没有谁能完美地挑选出你需要和你可能喜欢的东西。

所以，不要听从他人的建议。自己进行研究，选择你想尝试的下一个发行版。

即使你知道你想要什么，也不要期望新的发行版一定会比你当前的发行版更好。各个发行版在许多方面都有所不同。

你的下一个发行版可能解决了你遇到的问题，但也可能会带来你没有…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[“mm_percpu_wq” is a kernel thread based on a workqueue which is created in the “init_mm_internals” function (https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v6.4-rc5/source/mm/vmstat.c#L2100). It is part of the the statistics management regarding virtual memory (https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v6.4-rc5/source/mm/vmstat.c#L5). An overview diagram of virtual memory is shown below.
 Overall, “mm_percpu_wq” is the worker thread which updates different counters about the virtual memory of a Linux system. It is also called the “vmstat worker” (https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v6.4-rc5/source/mm/vmstat.c#L2021). “vmstat” stands for “Virtual Memory Statistics” which includes information such as: number of free pages, number of mapped pages, number or dirty pages, amount of memory allocated to kernel stacks and more (there are more than 150 different counters).
 The statistics can be read from the file “/proc/vmstat” (https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man5/proc.5.html). This proc entry is created with others (“buddyinfo, “pagetypeinfo” and “zoneinfo”) in the same file in which “mm_percpu_mm” is allocated (https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v6.4-rc5/source/mm/vmstat.c#L2123). We can see the list of the metric counters in the source code (https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v6.4-rc5/source/mm/vmstat.c#L1168).
 As it names suggested the kernel thread is responsible for accumulating the vm events among all CPUs (https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v6.4-rc5/source/mm/vmstat.c#L126). It is done by going over all the “online” CPUs (https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v6.4-rc5/source/mm/vmstat.c#L117).

	be required in order to implement Vulkan correctly in a bunch of

	don't want to be maintaining support for that interface for another
	10 years when it only partially works.

当然，本章节的内容肯定不是教大家如何更好地用备忘录 app 发声明，而是希望通过这款系统应用让大家可以更好地记录、整理以及分享来自生活、工作或者学习中的各类素材。
语音备忘录 app 则是一款更容易被忽视的系统应用，其实它对于学生或者商务人士来说非常简单好用，通过苹果设备就可以获得收音质量出色的录音功能，可以满足大多数人的需求，免去了另外购置设备的麻烦。同样在本章节中，我将为大家介绍这款系统应用以及如何更好地使用它。

互联网总是在消亡；多年来它一直在消亡，被那些从网站上转移流量的应用程序或奖励所谓缩短注意力的算法所杀死。但最近几个月，人工智能正在加速扼杀旧互联网。谷歌正试图改变其几十年一成不变的蓝色链接列表；领英使用人工智能来刺激疲劳的用户；Snapchat 和 Instagram 希望机器人能在你的朋友不在时与你交谈；Reddit 的版主们在抗议天价 API；Stack Overflow 的管理员们则在反对人工智能生成的内容；互联网档案馆正在对抗数据刮削者；维基百科正在被人工智能撕碎；聊天机器人们在反刍自己幻想出来的内容。

DeepMind 称其下一个人工智能系统将超过 ChatGPT

DeepMind 的 CEO 说，他们正在开发一个被称为 Gemini 的人工智能系统，该系统将比 OpenAI 的 ChatGPT 背后的系统更强大，Gemini 将结合 AlphaGo 中使用的技术，赋予该系统新的能力，如计划或解决问题的能力。AlphaGo 基于 DeepMind 的强化学习技术，通过反复尝试并接受关于其表现的反馈，学会处理需要选择采取何种行动的棘手问题。2016 年，AlphaGo 击败了人类棋手冠军，创造了历史。Gemini 仍在开发中，还将需要数月时间，它可能花费数千万乃至数亿美元。

澳大利亚建议居民每晚重启手机

澳大利亚政府告诉居民，作为一项网络安全措施，他们应该每天关闭和重新开启他们的智能手机。这个建议并不新鲜。2020 年，美国国家安全局发布了移动设备安全的最佳实践指南，其中包括每周重启一次智能手机以防止黑客攻击。网络安全专家称，定期重启手机可以将风险降到最低，因为它强行关闭了在后台运行的任何可能恶意监控用户或收集数据的应用程序和进程。

        <link href="https://linux.cn/article-15947-1.html?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss"/>
        <updated>2023-06-27T07:59:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[以下是在 GNOME 版本的 Fedora 工作站中启用分数缩放的步骤。


分数缩放Fractional Scaling 是一项方便的功能，可让你最大程度地优化 HiDPI 显示器和高分辨率笔记本电脑。通过微调缩放比例，你可以创建平衡良好、既不太大也不太小且美观的桌面显示。虽然通过分辨率设置也可以，但由于操作系统的限制，它们通常符合你的实际情况。

此外，它还允许你增加显示屏上文本和其他 UI 元素的大小，而不会使所有内容显得模糊。如果你有高分辨率显示器并希望使文本更易于阅读，这将很有用。

Ubuntu 20.04 LTS 在 2020 年引入了 100%、125%、150%、175% 和 200% 的分数缩放。它可以在“显示Display”页面下的“设置Settings”中找到。

但在默认 GNOME 桌面的 Fedora 工作站中，只有 100% 和 200% 缩放可用。



如何使用 GNOME 在 Fedora 中启用分数缩放

打开终端窗口（CTRL+ALT+T）。

运行以下命令。此命令在带有 GNOME 的 Fedora 中启用 125%、150% 和 175% 缩放因子。

gsettings set org.gnome.mutter experimental-features "['scale-monitor-framebuffer']"


重启 Fedora。

打开 “设置” 应用，你应该会看到新的缩放因子。



但是，重要的是要注意分数缩放并不总是完美的。某些应用程序可能无法正确缩放。例如，如果应用程序设计不当，非 GTK 应用可能看起来很模糊。

此外，请务必注意，由于 GPU 的渲染工作量更大，分数缩放可能会增加笔记本电脑的功耗。

一些使用说明

根据我的测试，上述命令在 Wayland 中应该是有效的。

如果你不想使用上述命令，但仍想获得类似的体验，那么你可以按照以下步骤操作：

使用 sudo dnf install gnome-tweaks 安装 GNOME “调整Tweaks” 应用。

转到 “字体Fonts” 设置并更改比例因子。

示例：如果你想保持 100% 缩放比例但想要更大的字体，请尝试缩放比例设为 1.1 或 1.2。根据你的需要进行调整。




125%：这是分数缩放的典型值。它将文本大小和 UI 元素增加 25% 而不会使所有内容显得模糊。

150%：对于想要放大文本和其他 UI 元素但又不想增加显示分辨率的人来说，这是一个很好的值。

175%：对于想要使文本和其他 UI 元素变得非常大的人来说，这是一个很好的值。


尝试不同的缩放因子对于找到最适合你的缩放因子至关重要。最佳缩放因子将取决于你的显示器尺寸、视力和偏好。

我希望本指南有所帮助。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have an RTX3060 TI and a Ryzen 5 5600g. Want to get back to Linux from Windows after a gap of 6 years. I hear that Nvidia cards can have issues with the display if you run dual monitors that have variable refresh rates/resolutions (on Wayland). Is this still true?
 ​
 My main monitor is 1440p 144hz but I also use my older 1080P 75hz panel as a secondary display. Are the issues with Nvidia in this case bad enough to warrant a switch to an AMD card? I don't mind getting a new RX 6800XT since they are available for around $500.
 ​
 Any insights would be appreciated.
 ​
 Edit: Forgot all about another major issue. I had to undervolt my GPU and put a custom fan curve on Afterburner to keep temps under 80c. It is a Zotac dual fan with underwhelming cooling. Ambient temps where I live can go as high as 32c in summer. I guess that's another point for an AMD upgrade since apparently, you cannot undervolt NVidia on Linux?

《繁花》出了一个新版。金宇澄著，沈宏非批注，姜庆共排版。排版先生上封面，罕见，但也因此看得出，沈宏非的批注有多激情，搞得姜先生一会让朱色批注在墨色正文间横躺，一会又竖插一个对话框，夹批与侧批齐飞，段批共尾批一色，也算印刷史上无前例的文本。
当然，批注本的好看，还不在皮相。金宇澄不响，沈宏非狂批。沈爷不仅充分展现自己食神本色，遇到“菜泡饭”“虾籽鲞鱼”“烂糊三鲜汤”“糯米双酿团”“西湖莼菜羹”这样的地方美食，立马展现专业知识和个人权威，而且一手一脚提溜进汁水丰富的历史人文，比如拾玖章提到“走油蹄髈”，沈爷先讲了蹄髈做法，又补上花絮：“‘文革’后落实政策，大笔钱财突然从天而降，世面却无车无房无奢侈品可购、无股票可炒，唯有猛吃，鱼翅、鲍鱼登场之前，‘走油蹄髈’‘全鸡全鸭’一度成为发还抄家财物者‘报复社会’之首选，曾有人日进一簋，月余暴卒。”
跟“食”关联度最高的“色”事，沈爷更是手到擒来如数家珍。金爷小说中，让年轻读者略感门槛的是，对五六十年代穿着和时尚的表达，沈爷凭着半个世纪在色相上的造诣，一一圈画，即便我们这种有点阅历的南方读者，亦大开眼界。
小说第六章，梅瑞告诉康总，她妈终于离婚了，在家清理衣服，织锦缎棉袄，罩衫，横贡缎棉袄，灯芯绒裤子，卡其裤子，两用衫，春秋呢大衣，法兰绒短大衣，派克大衣，哔叽长裤，舍维尼长裤，中长纤维两用衫，朝阳格衬衫，泡泡纱裙子，腈纶开司米三翻领，湖绉荷叶滚边裙，蓝棠皮鞋，江青裙，列宁装等等等等，沈宏非都以饕餮的快乐，色色批注。看好了，“斜纹布西服装大翻领”，“中横布带一根，束起来显腰身”，“‘集各朝女服之大成’设计的开襟V字领连衫裙，裙下摆至小腿中部，有使其（如中山装）成为女性‘国服’之意”，而且，这些食色交融的批注和老金的原文辉映成…]]></summary>

 So, let's limit my CPU Mhz. Installed sudo pacman -S linux-tools
 First use cpupower frequency-info too find available speeds:
 "available frequency steps: 3.60 GHz, 3.20 GHz, 2.20 GHz"
 Then I set my Ryzem 2600X to 3200 Mhz with the cpupower:
 sudo cpupower frequency-set --max 3200000
 Temperatures came down from 90 to 60 or below, and I was getting 36 fps and now 30 fps. So it is a nice trade off for low temperatures and take care of my cpu.
 You can configure HTOP to show the CPU Mhz and temperature, press F2 and in "Display Options", there is "Also show CPU frequency" and "Also show CPU temperature"

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, I am a Debian user and am looking to build a new system, something solid that'll last a good while. I don't need onboard wifi, which the Z590-A lacks, as I will only be using wired LAN, and I like that it has nice PCI-E slot options (3 x16 and an x4) and can take up to 128 GB (64 would be enough for my needs, though I like having room to go higher if needed.) I have a Radeon RX 6600 XT that I got for a good price a couple months ago but it still waiting to be used until I get everything else to build this system.
 One motherboard that I've come across that appears to meat my criteria is ASUS Prime Z590-A which is LGA 1200, which I found via:
 https://pcpartpicker.com/product/fwVmP6/asus-prime-z590-a-atx-lga1200-motherboard-prime-z590-a
 The problem is I am having a hard time fining good information of how well it might be supported by Debian 12, or Linux in general, so I would really appreciate any insight and guidance, as well as any good alternatives, including AMD boards. I just need similar PCI-E options as above (either multple x16s or one x16 and some x4 and/or x8 slots - I will only be running the one graphics card so one x16 is needed for that, I need other slots for a capture card and other hardware that are mainly x4 max.)
 Thanks.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[通常，我用的是基于 Ubuntu 的发行版进行工作，如 Pop!_OS、Zorin OS、Linux Mint 或 Ubuntu 本身。

它们不会干扰我的工作，同时又提供了顺滑的软件更新。更不用说，它们与我使用的英特尔-英伟达系统相容性良好。

所有的一切（可能是主观的）都能开箱即用。

然而，最近我决定在实体机上切换到 Arch Linux（我大部分时间都是在虚拟机上使用它）。

结果，我最终选择使用了 Manjaro Linux（一款基于 Arch 的发行版）。

我选择 Manjaro Linux 的原因

令我惊讶的是，即使是使用 Arch Linux 的立付 USB，我甚至无法解决 “nouveau DRM: core notifier timeout” 错误，更别提继续安装了。是的，我知道有向导式的 Arch Linux 安装程序，但是不论怎么样，连接的显示器都会闪烁并突出显示这个错误。

解决这个问题的最好办法是不使用我的最近刚刚升级的英伟达显卡。

很遗憾，我更喜欢英伟达的显卡……

AMD 的 RX 6600 XT 的价格与 RTX 3060 Ti 相当；对于 1440p 来说，购买那款显卡是没有意义的。

因此，在我这个情况下，RTX 3060 Ti 可能是问题所在。

虽然我找到了一些解决问题的方法，但是我太懒了。我只是想看看能否在不用付出太多努力的情况下体验一下 Arch Linux。

所以，我做了以下的事情：

下一个最佳选择就是尝试任何一个专门简化了麻烦的 最佳的基于 Arch 的发行版，对吧？

这就是 Manjaro Linux 登场的地方。

Manjaro Linux 是一款流行的基于 Arch 的发行版，并且我注意到每次更新时都有各种改进（在虚拟机上使用时）。

此外，我喜欢 Manjaro 默认主题…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[民国时期，晚明文人张岱（1597-1689？）的文章著述颇受读书界的重视，其中以周作人（1885-1967）为核心的文人群体为最著。当前学界对张岱民国时期接受史的研究多聚焦于周作人及其弟子——整理出版《陶庵梦忆》的俞平伯（1900-1990），而对另一位与《西湖梦寻》《琅嬛文集》关系颇为密切的苦雨斋弟子沈启无（1902-1969）关注相对不足，笔者因撰小文，略述细节，聊备掌故。
一、缘起《近代散文抄》
沈启无对张岱的接受与推崇，盖与周作人有关。1927年4月，朴社重刊本《陶庵梦忆》面世，该本系据清咸丰间《粤雅堂丛书》刊本整理。周作人为此本作序云：“他（引按：张岱）所选的《一卷冰雪文》曾在大路的旧书店中见过，因索价太昂未曾买得。”大抵是有鉴于此，沈启无于1930年9月编定的明清散文小品选本即以《冰雪小品》名之。该书起初因故未刊，1932年9月改名《近代散文抄》由北平人文书店出版。书中选录张岱散文二十八篇，为入选诸家之最。
沈启无编选《近代散文抄》时亦受周作人影响颇著，尤其是编选张岱散文的过程大抵可考。今按《近代散文抄》书末“抄撮书目”即载有“《张子诗文粃》二十三卷”“《琅嬛文集》十六卷”。其中“《张子诗文粃》二十三卷”系鄞马廉（字隅卿）旧藏清稿本《琅嬛文集》二十三卷十二册，分为《张子文粃》十八卷八册，《张子诗粃》五卷四册（下简称“清稿本”。按马廉《不登大雅文库书目》著录《张子诗粃》为四卷，盖第五卷残损过甚故），今藏国家图书馆（索书号：A01784）。该本为套格纸抄本，版心下方镌“凤嬉堂”，页眉行间有王雨谦评语。

国家图书馆藏清稿本《琅嬛文集·张子诗粃》书影

至于所谓“《琅嬛文集》十六卷”，北京师范大学图书馆杨健先生撰《周作人校藏本〈琅嬛文集〉略考》（载于《鲁迅研究月刊》2018年第1期）指出其中的“《琅嬛文集》十六卷”即周作人旧藏清光绪刊本六卷（下简称“刊本”），此处“十…]]></summary>

 The actual ram usage is about 10 GiB, which is what top, fastfetch and free -gh are reporting, but htop is reporting 6.5 GiB? Why is that? I also tried launching htop with its default config and I still get the same issue.
 This is the first time this has ever happened btw.

to the many criticisms aimed at the company since it changed its policy
regarding RHEL source code.


	Ultimately, we do not find value in a RHEL rebuild and we are not
	under any obligation to make things easier for rebuilders; this is
	our call to make. That brings me to CentOS Stream, of which there
	is immense confusion. I acknowledge that this is a change in a
	longstanding tradition where we went above and beyond, and change
	like this can cause some confusion. That confusion manifested as
	accusations about us going closed-source and about alleged GPL
	violations. There is CentOS Stream the binary deliverable, and
	CentOS Stream the source repository. The CentOS Stream
	gitlab source is where we build RHEL releases, in the open for
	all to see. To call RHEL “closed source” is categorically untrue
	and inaccurate. CentOS Stream moves faster than RHEL, so it might

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[today is my 32nd birthday. and before I get to my question I want to quickly talk about myself. I have a micro-enterprise which sells Linux/digital security courses etc. I also have a youtube channel that talks about linux with more than 30k subscribers which generates me a small income of 120 dolars.
 I work remotely from home and this is how I keep my self, my wife and 4 kids.
 I need suggestions and tips for my first job in the sysadmin area. I have a good experience with linux and I've been a user since 2005, I've always been a lot of tinkering and I use distributions like gentoo/slackware. I have good knowledge in Shell Scripts and backup schemes. I keep some VPS with Debian/Centos (deceased)/Slackware with the most varied services like moodle, irc, libreddit, email (postfix), tor, elog and anything else that comes to mind.
 And today on my birthday I woke up very determined to work in the area (for real). A lot, I love this area, I love the command line, I love configuration files. Some details: * I am fully self-taught * I don't have college * I have several courses on udemy (I don't know if it helps) * I'm autistic, and linux is my hyperfocus since 2005, I love it deeply. * I like to write documentation and organize scripts etc...
 A peculiar detail is that, as I am autistic, I cannot work outside the home, that is, it needs to be remotely because I cannot go out and be locked up somewhere (I have panic attacks)
 english Well, what would be your tip to put on my resume?
 I am Brazilian.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey Reddit community,
 I'm in a dilemma and need your advice. I'm looking for a Linux distribution that prioritizes bug fixes and provides quick security updates without focusing too much on additional features. After some research, I've narrowed down my options to Fedora and Ubuntu LTS, but I'm having trouble deciding which one would be the better choice.
 On one hand, Fedora is known for its cutting-edge nature and frequent updates, which could potentially mean faster bug fixes and security patches. However, the rapid pace of development may also introduce new bugs or stability issues.
 On the other hand, Ubuntu LTS (Long Term Support) versions are designed to provide a stable and reliable experience over an extended period. They prioritize bug fixes and security updates while minimizing major changes, making them ideal for users who value stability.
 Considering my primary focus on bug fixes and quick security updates, which distribution do you think would be the better choice for me? Have you had any personal experiences with either Fedora or Ubuntu LTS regarding their maintenance and support?
 I appreciate any insights, opinions, or personal experiences you can share to help me make an informed decision. Thanks in advance!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I worked on a web service that allows you to import a song and define a target length that the song will be shortened or lengthened to. It does this by analyzing the song and finding repeating audio patterns. This is helpful for making any song match a video or performance with a set duration. You can also specify areas of the song to prefer or avoid. An example is available here: https://mofi.loud.red/edit/8bd3fdf780f8c3927e41029f3b957f8a7...
The cool thing is that after the song is analyzed on the server, the client can recompute and preview the results completely client-side through an implementation that uses Web Workers and WebAssembly. The audio previewing uses Tone.js. I am thinking of writing up some more details about the implementation in the future.
I'm still working on a way to explain this easily, but I like the idea of carrying over the concept of content-aware fill from images to audio.
Please let me know if you have any comments or questions!

I’ve helped build infrastructure tooling from scratch at multiple companies and realized two things: that the shape of the solution with the advent of containerization, Kubernetes, and hyperscalers is quite similar across orgs, and that highly knowledgeable engineers are needed to build and manage this system.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[早些时候，苹果曾宣布，将在今年7月关闭iCloud的免费功能“My Photo Stream”（我的照片流），这一推出十余年的服务即将被弃用。近日，有用户发现，用户已经无法为我的照片流功能上传任何新的图片。


而根据苹果方面发布的公告，从6月26日起，新照片将停止从设备上传到“我的照片流”，在该日期之前上传到此服务的照片将在iCloud中保留30天（自上传日期起）。也就是说，最迟在7月26日中，iCloud中将不会保留任何通过该服务上传的图片，服务也正式关闭。


“My Photo Stream”服务于 2011 年由史蒂夫・乔布斯作为 iCloud 的一部分推出，可以自动将一个设备上的照片和视频上传到另一个设备上，无需手动同步。这项功能不占用免费的 5GB iCloud 存储空间，但只能存储 1000 个文件，并且不支持全分辨率同步。


苹果公司后来推出了 iCloud Photo Library（现在称为 iCloud Photos），作为一个功能齐全的照片和视频同步服务。iCloud Photos 需要付费订阅 iCloud 才能使用超过免费的 5GB iCloud 的存储空间，套餐从每月 0.99 美元起，可选 50GB 到 2TB 不等。


在关闭我的照片流服务的同时，苹果建议用户更换使用iCloud Photos服务，并给出了具体操作流程：


在iPhone、iPad或iPod touch上


1、打开照片并点击相册；


2、点击我的照片流>选择；


3、点击你想要保存的照片，然后点击分享按钮>保存图片。


在Mac上


1、打开照片应用，然后打开我的照片流相册；


2、选择你想要保存但目前不在你的照片库中的任何照片；


3、将它们从我的照片流相册拖到你的库中。]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[中国论文贡献度首次超越美国

《自然》杂志分析了 2022 年全球知名科学期刊论文的各国贡献度，结果显示，中国首次超越美国登上榜首。该排行榜依据论文作者及所属机构的“自然指数”汇总进行排名。对于《自然》、《科学》等 82 种期刊的自然科学领域论文，计算作者所属机构所在国的比例，把总和作为贡献度进行比较，结果显示中国排名第一。美国、德国、英国、日本等分列第二到第五。而从包括大学在内的研究机构来看，前十有六家来自中国，中国科学院居首。

老王点评：看起来可喜可贺，但是我们的基础科学研究还不够强，还需要继续努力。




英伟达最新 GPU 黑市价格翻番

去年，美国商务部阻止了包括英伟达和 AMD 在内的美国顶级硬件公司向中国和俄罗斯出售其最先进的芯片。其中，英伟达的 A100 和 H100 GPU 属于出口管制的对象。这导致这些芯片在黑市的价格达到了 2 万美元，比正常价格高一倍，并且没有保修和支持。


消息来源：The Register



老王点评：现在 AI 对 GPU 的需求非常迫切，这可比挖矿那时候对 GPU 的需求更紧迫。




NFC 将变得更强

负责制定近场通讯规范的 NFC 论坛公布了到 2028 年的主要计划和研究工作。主要的五个方面包括：NFC 无线充电的功率将从 1 瓦提升到 3 瓦；连接范围将从 5 毫米提升四到六倍；支持多用途轻触；使支持 NFC 手机具有 POS 功能；能够分享其成分和产品回收方式的数据。


消息来源：The Register



老王点评：虽然要几年才能落地，但我总觉得 NFC 变强也带来更多风险，比如近场通讯的距离变得更远，盗刷风险就大了。]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Apologies but asking here as /r/linuxquestions is still locked.
 I work for a private ISP, we sell managed networks to customers with various services. I have a VMware ESXi server, and to simplify things let's say it currently has 10 VMs, each VM having a management NIC, and a customer VLAN NIC. Currently I can use a service like NRPE to execute commands on each VM, and NRPE runs a networking command (like a cURL, ping, or similar) over the customer network NIC. The NRPE agent listens on the management NIC, but executes the commands over the customer VLAN NIC.
 Customer wise, for simplicity we'll say customers are called Customer1, Customer2, Customer3, and so on. Their VLANs correspond like 10, 20, 30, and so on. Each customer network has an identical IP space of 10.0.0.0/8, and the IP of this VM will be identical in each of the networks.
 I'm building a new VM which has a single management NIC, and a single trunk NIC (VLAN 4095 in VMware parlance). I've tested configuring the secondary NIC on the VM as Customer1 with VLAN 10 tagged, and that works fine (so the port is all good), but I'm having trouble with network namespaces. My end goal is to be able to run commands like ip netns exec customer1 ping 8.8.8.8 and get the results (quick crap example, but you get the idea).
 I tried to borrow the principles from this article but it wouldn't work for me. 
 Update: Now resolved thanks to /u/J4yD4n suggestion of splitting the trunk interface in to separate per-VLAN subints and then attaching namespaces to them individually.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[开发人员可以通过将开源软件集成到其代码库中，节省时间并避免重复发明轮子。然而，这也带来了严重的许可侵权风险。你必须遵守适用于重新使用的开源代码的众多开源许可证之一。如果你不这样做，你（或你所在公司）有可能因违反开源许可证条款而被起诉。即使这种诉讼并不普遍发生，它们确实存在。实际上，考虑到现在许多开源项目由希望保护其在开源社区中的投资的企业运营，这种情况在未来可能更加频繁发生。

1、熟悉开源许可证

了解开源许可证是防止开源许可侵权问题中最重要的一步。很容易认为所有开源许可证都施加相同的条件，或者它们都基本要求源代码的持续可用性。实际上，有数十种不同的开源许可证，它们都有着非常不同的条款。简单地认为只要你从一个开源项目获取代码，你可以随意使用它并保持源代码可访问，这是一个严重的错误。几个开源许可证的一个典型但经常被忽视的条件可能是需要向原始作者提供致谢。

2、记录你使用的开源内容

建立一个标准化的方法来记录你使用开源代码的情况是一个优秀的做法。导入模块或从 GitHub 粘贴代码并不难。但如果你不追踪代码来自何处以及使用了何种许可证，你可能会忘记在代码库中如何以及在哪里集成开源内容。此外，如果你在借用代码时无法证明自己遵守了有效的许可条件，那么在开源许可证发生变化时可能会产生问题。考虑在文档维基（如果有的话）中添加一个页面，列出你使用的开源代码，以避免出现这个问题。每当你包含开源组件或依赖时，至少在你自己的源代码中添加注释。

3、避免使用未经授权的开源组件

有时，你可能会偶然发现一个隐藏的 GitHub 存储库或其他源代码托管位置，其中包含你希望使用的代码，但没有提到任何许可指南。你可能会认为代码的创建者希望让其成为开源代码，并且你可以根据自己的意愿使用它。但这是一个危险的假设。开发人员可能会后续对代码设置特定的许可条件，并要求你遵守这些条件，这可能导致未来产生许可侵权的指控。除非你有非常充分的理由，否则避免使用缺乏明确许可限制的模糊代码。

4、创建自己的开源代码

将你自己的软件完全开源是减少与开源许可相关风险的一种方法。这意味着你将自动遵守任何要求保留派生源代码的开源许可条件。然而，请记住，仅仅开放你自己的代码并不能确保完全遵守许可证。你仍然需要努力确保你遵守每个许可证的规定，因为适用于你借用的代码的许可证可能与你选择的开源许可证不同。然而，你无需担心与源代码共享相关的任何条款。

5、自动检测开源组件

虽然在代码库内手动跟踪你如何使用开源是很好的做法，但通过使用能够自动识别开源组件和依赖项的软件，你可以降低出错的可能性。在这里，我们应该考虑两种不同类型的工具。一种是源代码组成分析（SCA）软件，它会自动扫描源代码并识别从值得信任的外部来源获取的元素。另一种是软件供应链管理解决方案，除其他功能外，还支持查找和监控应用程序堆栈中的任何开源依赖项。

API 网关是一个单一节点，提供对 API 调用入口。网关聚合了所请求的服务，并相应传回合适的响应信息。为了令你的 API 网关有效地工作，设计一个可靠、高效且简洁地 API 至关重要。本文介绍一种设计风格，但只要你理解其中的重点内容，它就能解决你的相关问题。

由 API 主导的方法

API 主导的方法是将 API 置于应用程序和它们需要访问的业务能力之间的通信核心，从而在所有数字通道上一致地交付无缝功能。API 主导的连接是指使用一种可重用、且设计得当的 API 来连接数据和应用程序的方法。

API 主导的架构

API 主导的架构是一种架构方法，它着眼于实现重用 API 的最佳方式。它能解决以下问题：


保护 API，使外界无法在未授权情况下访问 API

确保应用程序能找到正确的 API 端点

限制对 API 的请求次数，从而确保持续的可用性

支持持续集成、测试、生命周期管理、监控、运维等等

防止错误在栈间传播

对 API 的实时监测和分析

实现可伸缩和灵活的业务能力（例如支持 微服务 架构）


API 资源路由

实现一个 API 网关，把它作为与所有服务通信的单一入口点，意味着使用者只需要知道 URL 就能使用 API。将请求路由到相应的服务端点，并执行相应的功能是 API 网关的职责。



由于客户端应用程序不需要从多个 HTTP 端点调用功能，这个办法就减少了 API 使用者的操作复杂度。对每个服务来说，也不需实现一个单独的层级去实现认证、授权、节流和速度限制。大多数API 网关，如开源的 Apache APISIX，已经包含了这些核心功能。

API 基于内容的路由

基于内容的路由机制也使用 API 网关根据请求的内容进行路由调用。…]]></summary>

春天时，听完了杰森·萨默的《什穆尔的桥：跟随我的幸存者父亲回访奥斯维辛》的有声书。再读实体书时，已是初秋。
新冠的第三个夏天太美丽，忙着旅行、享用花草瓜果，不宜也不应该阅读这样严肃、凝重的书。疫情虽然没有结束，但世界上大部分地区的人们都恢复了从前夏天的活动。最明显的，便是旅行。回故乡，或是就地重逢，或是前往陌生的远方。旅行，是人们制造或者寻找记忆的地方。
然而，一进9月，天气转凉，空气似乎也便凝重了起来。9月18日，美国公共广播电台（PBS）上播出了知名纪录片制作人肯·伯恩斯的纪录片《美国和大屠杀》（United States and the Holocaust），三集，六个小时。九·一八，中国人自然会想起“从那个悲惨的时候”。
记住回忆。
大屠杀：读不完的书，看不完的电影
第一次接触大屠杀题材，看的是梅丽尔·斯特里普主演的四集电视剧《大屠杀》。那之后不久，在长江航船上读到了《安妮·弗兰克日记》。在美国读书期间，去欧洲参加过一次上海前犹太居民的会议，从那次会议上，第一次听幸存者的后代说，他们很多人没有见过自己的祖父母。“大屠杀”这个题目，一下子具体化了，变成了家族树上断裂的链条。
以色列作家阿摩司·奥兹在他的回忆录《爱与黑暗的故事》(A Tale of Love and Darkness)中，生动地描写了母亲的出生地，位于乌克兰境内的罗夫诺，却一直不愿意前往访问。后来，他的女儿范尼亚·奥兹代他前往。他的小说《轻抚水，轻抚风》（Touch the Water, Touch the Wind），对在德国文化中侵染多年，却一夜之间沦为流亡者，在黑暗的森林中藏匿逃生的犹太青年充满了温柔的同情。

沈周（1427-1509）作为吴门画派的领袖名闻于当时，“评者谓为明世第一”（《明史》卷二九八）；但他不仅是画家，也是隐士，既不参加科考，亦拒绝征召，终生未仕。与传统的离群索居、遗世高蹈的隐者形象不同，沈周一生雅集不断，应酬频繁，弟子文徵明在《沈先生行状》中记载：“晚岁名益盛，客至亦益多，户屦常满。先生既老，而聪明不衰，酬对终日，不少厌怠。风流文物，照映一时。”（《甫田集》卷二十五）沈周隐居的有竹居，不像安静的世外桃源，更似热闹的文化中心，“每黎明，门未辟，舟已塞乎其港矣。先生固喜客，至则相与䜩笑咏歌，出古图书器物，摸抚品题，酬对终日不厌”（王鏊《石田先生墓志铭》）。沈周的交游对象，当然也不仅仅是布衣山人、方外僧道，各种地方官员乃至馆阁诸公，都与其过从甚密。虽然沈周自称“酷爱林泉图上见，生憎官府酒边谈”（《市隐》），但他并不排斥政治，回避官员，甚至主动与官员交接。当下的研究者几乎都注意到了这一点，认为沈周与官宦的交往对提高其声誉、传播其作品起了重要作用。但是这种交游是如何影响沈周在美术与文学上的具体创作，在吴门画派的崛起过程中又有何作用？涉及者尚寥寥无几。

沈周作为吴门画派创始人，是美术界关注的热点，仅在“中国知网”数据库中以“沈周”为标题进行检索，近十年（2012-2022）来平均每年都有三十篇以上的论文发布，其中秦晓磊博士先后发表的《与邑作奇观——沈周、文徵明笔下的虞山古桧》（《故宫博物院学刊》2018年第2期）、《李东阳对沈周绘画的鉴藏——兼论北京文官与沈周的互动》（《中国国家博物馆馆刊》2018年第7期）、《沈周〈庐墓图〉与茔域山水画》（《文艺研究》2018年第11期）、《沈周〈沧洲趣图〉的意涵、年代及接受者》（《美术》2019年第6…]]></summary>

 I’m aware I can write a sh script that loops over the session names as the arguments (eg. for session in $@), BUT the problem is this doesn’t allow for Tab autocompletion of the session name. Since my session names are pretty long/specific , having this would be super helpful.
 Any thoughts on how to resolve this are appreciated. Thank you!

 I tried to log into Chase.com, and saw it gave me a "we've enhanced our platform" error on ARM when it allows x86 Linux fine. I called Chase and they said to "call a Geek Squad" or "call Apple" while claiming "we can't do anything", basically blaming Apple. As if Apple is responsible for Debian's Asahi remix and Firefox on ARM Linux. I fought them and they said "OK, we can send it to our analysts to check".

	Most of the stuff in my mailbox the last week has been about
	upcoming things for 6.5, and I already have 15 pull requests
	pending. I appreciate all you proactive people.

	But that's for tomorrow. Today we're all busy build-testing the
	newest kernel release, and checking that it's all good. Right?


Headline features in this release include:
generic iterators for BPF,
the removal of the SELinux runtime disable
knob,
the removal of the SLOB memory allocator,
linear address masking support on Intel
CPUs,
process-level samepage merging control,
support for user trace events,
more infrastructure for writing kernel modules in Rust,
per-VMA locks,
and much more.
See the LWN merge-window summaries (part 1, part 2), and the (in-progress) KernelNewbies 6.4 page for
the details.]]></summary>

 I looked into "restreamer", but I think it streams a stream to other services only and has no history. Right now, I try to setup "avideo" (or "youphptube") inside ubuntu docker container with mixed success.
 Is there an application to allow presenting a video stream via a web page (or anything else that will work on android) with the functionality of rewinding to the past and recording everything to a directory?
 If I understand, when I set up nginx with rtmp it can stream the stream. And the stream is recorded to a directory. But to watch "what has happened 2 hours ago" I have to open the directory where the stream is recorded and download a file and watch it. I want it to work like youtube. Just click 2 hours ago on the video. How do I do that?
 Thanks.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello,
 I'm having a bit of an issue with Plymouth. I'm running the code below for a theme, however scaling the images seem to make the whole script lag really bad. 
 There isn't much documentation available so I'm not sure what I'm doing wrong or why scaling these images would make it lag. As I understand it it only scales them once per image then is plays them but maybe I'm wrong, I don't know. 
 ```
 Window.SetBackgroundTopColor(0.234, 0.43, 0.705); Window.SetBackgroundBottomColor(0.16, 0.25, 0.44);
 window_width = Window.GetWidth(); window_height = Window.GetHeight();
 intro_index = 0; load_index = 0; max_intro = 37; max_load = 20;
 index = 0; while (1){ intro[index] = Image("IntroAnim" + index + ".png"); intro[index].Scale(window_width, window_height); if (index > max_intro) break; index++; }
 index = 0; while (1){ load[index] = Image("LoadAnim" + index + ".png"); load[index].Scale(window_width, window_height); if (index > max_load) break; index++; }
 sprite = Sprite();
 fun refresh (){ if (intro_index <= max_intro) { sprite.SetImage(intro[intro_index]); } if (intro_index > max_intro) { sprite.SetImage(load[load_index]); } intro_index++; load_index = (load_index + 1) % max_load; }
 Plymouth.SetRefreshFunction (refresh);

 Logging in using sddm or any other DM, both monitors flicker for maybe half a second.
 Starting an application from the launcher, nothing happens. Switch to terminal to see what's up. Solved in a couple of google searches. 
 And some more little tiny annoyances.
 It's nothing, basically. I love Linux, everything works. But the experience just isn't smooth. Everything "works". 
 Will those annoyances go away if I use Debian or OpenSUSE Leap? Maybe you can tell. To me there's always some thing I have to fix. Maybe that's why I love Linux.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey HN, I didn't want my Gateway 4DX2-66 from 1993 to be left out of the AI revolution, so I built an AI Assistant for Windows 3.1, based on the OpenAI API.
The most interesting parts of building this were:
- Getting TLS 1.2 and 1.3 working on Windows 3.1 so that WinGPT could directly connect to OpenAI's server without relying on a modern machine for TLS termination.
- Learning about the memory segmentation architecture on 16-bit Windows, including the difference between far and near pointers.
- Building the UI in plain C code with the Windows API and limited selection of controls in Windows 3.1.
You can check it out here and learn more about what it was like to build it: https://www.dialup.net/wingpt/

 Let's be honest, one of the most common complaints i see about snaps other than load times are the fact that there's only one repository to pull packages from. And that's more than often commonly listed as the sole reason why flatpaks are "apparently" better.
 So why is it that flathub is the only repo that's list in every distro's documentation to enable? ArchwikiDebianGentoo
 In fact, it's also the only repo I see that has applications added to it. here's the breakdown on numbers. First here's how to find this pout yourself so lets enable the big three repo's that I've come across from stalking /r/flatpak

 I've been looking for about a week in researching this, running a multitude of config files, commands & installing programs that was recommended by other users on wiks/forums.
 I've reinstalled so many times after just messing up the audio system and it would never boot or hear any audio.
 Tired Pulsewave, pipewire doing different configs, no dice.
 Is there anyone out there who have similar setup or the knowhow to this, Can you assist please :)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi HN, I recently created and published an open-source resume builder as a weekend project. The idea came to me while I was mentoring students and noticing common mistakes they made in their resumes that I had also made in the past. I thought to build a tool to help people easily create a modern professional resume with built-in best practices to avoid those mistakes.
Top highlights of the resume builder are:
1. Real time UI update as you type
2. ATS friendly to top ATS platforms, e.g. Greenhouse, Lever
3. Privacy focus - no sign up is required and data is stored locally in browser that only users have access
4. Support import from existing resume PDF
The tool also includes a resume parser to help people test their existing resumes’ ATS readability if they might not be interested in using the builder. I also explained the parser algorithm in an article with interactive tables that might be an interesting read to see the steps and logics it uses (https://www.open-resume.com/resume-parser).
I hope others might find this tool useful and I look forward to hearing any feedback the community has. Thanks all.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[数百万 GitHub 项目易受依赖库劫持攻击

安全专家发现，数以百万计的 GitHub 项目易受依赖库劫持攻击，攻击者可以借此发动影响大量用户的供应链攻击。GitHub 上的用户名和项目或库的名字如果改变，为了避免破坏其它项目的依赖关系，GitHub 会创建一个重定向。但如果有人用旧的名字创建了账号，那么就会导致重定向无效。GitHub 可以防御部分此类攻击，但该防御方案可以被绕过。


消息来源：Aqua Sec



老王点评：我觉得 GitHub 应该更认真的解决这个问题，毕竟 GitHub 已经不仅仅是一个代码仓库，而是一个供应链的重要组成部分了。但从另外一个角度看，软件项目依赖这种不确定的供应链是不是也过于宽松了？




美国新数据显示，在家工作成为新常态

许多在大流行期间蜷缩在家里的白领工人已经回到办公室，但没有回到办公室的人特别多。对许多人来说，远程工作似乎是一种新常态。周四公布的美国经济数据显示，在家工作似乎已经成为一种趋势，特别是对女性和受过大学教育的人而言。2022 年的数据显示，34% 的 15 岁以上的人仍然在家里工作，54% 的人拥有学士或更高的学位。而美国旧金山市长已经 提议 将市中心荒废的购物中心改造为足球场，因为越来越多人不再回到市中心上班，旧金山的办公室空置率已达到 30 年来的最高水平。


消息来源：MSN



老王点评：不知道为什么美国人就不回去上班了，而我们似乎都赶紧回去了。




Firewalld 2.0 发布

开源防火墙守护程序 Firewalld 自 2011 年以来一直在开发，而两年前才达到 Firewalld 1.0 的里程碑。因此，发现 Firewalld 2.0 在今天发布有点令人惊讶。2.0 中最重要的变化解决了区域漂移的问题，即防火墙策略可能最终违反了 “数据包只进入一个区域” 的规则。此外，还增加了对 NFTables Flowtable 的支持，可以显著提高转发性能，将网络转发的 iperf 性能提高了约 59%。


消息来源：Phoronix



老王点评：看起来是 Firewalld 的开发在加速，不过我更觉得它是在飙版本号。看看 Firefox、Linux 内核等开源软件的版本号，看来开源软件对版本号的谦虚传统已经被丢弃了。]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[在本文中，我们将逐步向你展示如何在 Kubernetes（k8s）集群上安装 Ansible AWX。


Ansible AWX 是一个强大的开源工具，用于管理和自动化 IT 基础设施。AWX 为 Ansible 提供图形用户界面，使你可以轻松创建、安排和运行 Ansible 剧本Playbook。

另一方面，Kubernetes 是一种流行的容器编排平台，广泛用于部署和管理容器化应用。

先决条件：


Kubernetes 集群

Kubectl

具有 sudo 权限和集群管理员权限的普通用户

互联网连接


步骤 1：安装 Helm

如果你的系统上安装了 Helm，则在命令下运行以进行安装，

$ curl -fsSL -o get_helm.sh https://raw.githubusercontent.com/helm/helm/main/scripts/get-helm-3
$ chmod +x get_helm.sh
$ ./get_helm.sh
$ helm version




步骤 2：安装 AWX chart

在 Kubernetes 上安装 AWX 的最简单方法是使用 AWX Helm “海图chart”。因此，要通过 “海图” 安装 AWX，首先使用以下 helm 命令添加仓库。（LCTT 译注：Kubernetes 生态中大量使用了和航海有关的比喻，因此本文在翻译时也采用了这些比喻）

$ helm repo add awx-operator https://ansible.github.io/awx-operator/
"awx-operator" has been added to your repositories
$


注意：如果你之前已经添加过此仓库，请在命令下运行以…]]></summary>

加布里埃尔·伊根（Gabriel Egan）先生是英国德蒙福特大学教授、国际知名莎学专家，也是《新版牛津莎士比亚全集》的四位总编辑之一。《全集》前四卷已出版，分别是《现代评论版》《研究参考版》（两卷）和《作者身份溯源》；后两卷是《剧目别本》，将在2023-2024年出版。杨英军先生应《上海书评》之邀，借莎翁第一对开本出版四百年之机采访了伊根教授，请他谈了《新版牛津莎士比亚全集》的编纂及莎学研究的最新进展。

《新版牛津莎士比亚全集》书影

作为《新版牛津莎士比亚全集》（The New Oxford Shakespeare Complete Works）的四位总编辑之一，您已经付出了十多年的心血。您能跟读者分享一下最新进展吗？《全集》能否按计划在2023年完成？
伊根：《新版牛津莎士比亚全集》（以下简称《全集》）是国际莎学同行协力合作的项目，担任总编辑的还有佛罗里达州立大学的加里·泰勒（Gary Taylor）教授，伯明翰大学的约翰·乔维特（John Jowett）教授，印第安纳大学的特里·柏鲁斯（Terri Bourus）教授。
整套《全集》一共六卷，我们已经出版了四卷。第一卷是《全集：现代评论版》（The New Oxford Shakespeare: Modern Critical Edition）。这是面向二十一世纪读者的全集，我们对文本全部做了规范化的处理，以满足当代读者的期待，主要是将莎士比亚时代的拼写和标点符号加以校勘和更新，其中的表演选项提示（Performance Notes）是我们的创新，目标是帮助演员更好地呈现莎剧的艺术完整性。更多的注释是为了帮助读者更好地欣赏其中的戏剧和诗歌。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So I'm curently using Windows 7, don't care, it's fine, it runs everything I want and need, I don't keep any data I need go keep private about on my PC. The only problem is Steam dropping support for Windows 7.
 And I'm not switching to the garbage that is Windows 10, and especially not Windows 10 the sequel, aka 11.
 The problem why I never used Linux for gaming, is that most of my ancient games from the 90s, early 2000s just won't run on any Linux distro I tried. To be fair most of them barely run on Windows 7 but I can make it work with some fiddling. And I want my new rig to run everything, so I don't need two seperate PCs for running different eras of games.
 But that was years ago when I last tried it, maybe there are some improvements made to run old Windows software? Plus points if a distro has a super outdated UI and looks ancient.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Here is a video: https://youtu.be/cyWu_pHwqNg
 InkBox OS is a fully-functional operating system for some Kobo and Kindle eReader devices. It has pretty much been built from scratch, except for the base system which consists of Alpine Linux 3.10 (the reason why we use such an old version is because not all devices run a recent enough kernel to handle libc that weren't built for them). Most of the scripts, system initialization and graphical user interface programs were written from the ground up, though.
 I hope that you will enjoy it if you are able to try it!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Working from a personal PC has the downside of being responsible for its availability, regardless of what happens, as well as ensuring its safety against any invasion. Currently, my approach is as follows:
 ​
  
Having a Linux PC for work.
 
Using separate email accounts for different purposes.
 
Using secure passwords for each account.
 
Using one browser for confidential tasks and another for non-confidential tasks.
 
Avoiding logging in with confidential emails on unsafe devices.
 
Never saving or copying passwords.
 
Not sharing the number used for two-step authentication with work colleagues.
 
Providing fake personal information on each email account, such as a mother's name.
 
Avoiding the installation of unknown repositories, programs, or scripts.
 
 ​
 That covers the safety aspect.
 ​
 To ensure reliability, I always keep an external HD on hand that I can quickly use for work in case anything goes wrong with my work PC.
 ​
 I'm considering what else I could do. I've heard that password management apps are very secure, and some even offer two-step authentication. Additionally, syncing a folder to Google Drive might be the best way to ensure uninterrupted access to important data, regardless of any issues. However, I'm unsure if encrypting the HD has any downsides, such as decreased read/write speed or the risk of data loss due to errors.
 ​
 Ideally, for a reliable and safe scenario, it would be convenient to have all data saved in the cloud without the associated risks.
 ​
 What are your thoughts?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So, I'm working on making an boot image file for a device that uses Linux as a base OS, not sure what base distro, but for the majority of its system graphic files, it uses .bmp.gz files. Now, I already have my boot image file itself (640x480 24-bit color-depth bitmap) that's 901 KB in size. The trouble is, when I download a boot image from a community site that serves themes and boot logos, the boot logos are like 21 KB in size (that inflate to 901 KB .BMPs), and the default boot logo is deflated to a scant 10 KB! And it, too, inflates to 901 KB. When I use gzip to compress my file, I use the -v9k flag and only manage 84.1%, resulting in a compressed filesize of 144 KB. Is there anything I can do to increase compression?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Greetings, penguins. Got a question. So recently I had dual-boot Kali with Windows. After some failed usage of Kali I found out in web that Kali is not the best for desktop (better use with live boot). Then I transferred to Arch Linux, again dual-boot with Windows. But Arch wasn't so user friendly as I've expected. Instead of working for myself I was working to fix Arch. Now I have only Windows, but I want to use Linux as well, again with dual-boot. :)
 The question is what Linux distro would you recommend for dual-boot? I want something to help me understand how Linux works ( not ones that are 99% like Windows and etc. ) and if possible suitable for gaming. Thank you in advance!! :) 
 P. S. 
 If you're wondering why in the world I still want to use Windows the answer is Lenovo Vantage. My laptop is Lenovo Legion 5 pro and that app helps me to configure everything on my laptop, especially GPU Mode (Hybrid mode, dGPU mode, etc. ).

 I wonder if anyone has some kind of workaround or will the solution be implemented in some future updates? I saw that there are a lot of HP people that can't use Linux because of this and I think that is a big miss for everyone.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[人工智能工件需要新的开源许可证

上世纪七八十年代，由于自由软件运动的兴起，从版权法中衍生出来了自由及开源软件许可证，护航了自由及开源软件的蓬勃发展。人工智能诞生于开源软件，像 TensorFlow、PyTorch 这样的人工智能程序在其开源许可下运行良好。但新的人工智能工件，如数据集、模型、权重等并不完全适用于传统的版权模式。就像对 GitHub Copilot 输出的代码建议的起诉案，相信对用于训练人工智能违例使用各种训练素材的起诉会越来越多。甚至，会有像专利巨魔一样的许可证巨魔出现。开源倡议（OSI）和许多开源和人工智能领导人正在努力将人工智能和开源许可证以对两者都有意义的方式结合起来。


消息来源：The Register



老王点评：人工智能崛起的太快，一年前还没什么人谈论人工智能，以至于很多事情都来不及做好准备。所以，现在需要一个像当年的自由软件宣言一样的提纲挈领的倡议出现，以及在这个基础上建立的不同的许可证，才能真正为人工智能的发展铺平道路。




安卓的紧急呼叫打爆英国 999 紧急电话

安卓 12 系统为紧急服务增加了一个简单的功能：只要连按五次电源键，你的手机就会为你拨打紧急服务。当手机放在你的口袋里，或者你有一个不正常的电源按钮时，这显然很容易意外地做到。英国警方称，“所有紧急服务机构目前都在经历创纪录的 999 电话量”。有趣的是，带有这个功能的安卓 12 是在一年半前推出的，但直到现在才逐步普及到足够多的设备上。从那时起，就有源源不断的帖子提醒人们注意这个问题。在补丁出来之前，谷歌目前的建议是关闭该功能。


消息来源：Ars Technica



老王点评：这又是一个产品经理想当然的功能。




新车质量因使用更多新技术而下降

据研究，在美国销售的新车的质量正在下降，因为越来越多地使用了新技术和某些零件的制造质量下降等因素使这些车型更有“问题”。报告说，在过去两年中，每 100 辆车的问题数（PP100）上升了 30。特斯拉的 PP100 质量评级，同比增加了 31，到 2023 年达到了 257。新车提供的电子触摸式设计的门把手也成为了一个问题，在 10 个问题最多的车型中，有 7 个是电池电动车。


消息来源：路透社



老王点评：电动车是有很多先进的地方，但是堆砌不成熟的新技术往往是造成崩溃的原因。这有点像一个刚刚学会使用新框架的开发者，喜欢利用各种新功能来开发软件，但是往往出现一些问题。]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[《线的文化史》，[英]蒂姆·英戈尔德著，张晓佳译，明室Lucida｜北京联合出版社，2023年5月出版，288页，62.00元

日本科幻小说家伴名练的短篇小说《平滑世界和它的敌人》（收于《平滑世界和它的敌人》，丁丁虫译，译林出版社，2022年）讲述了一个有趣的故事：作品设定人类开发出一种名为“乘觉”的第六感，可以自由穿梭于平行时空当中，这样一来世界就变得无比“平滑”——无论在何时何地遇到问题，人只要调动“乘觉”前往新的时空，问题便可迎刃而解。
然而就是这样一个“美丽新世界”，却依然有它的敌人。有人开发出一种可以屏蔽“乘觉”的药物，结果一场意外事故让一名制药厂员工不慎失去了“乘觉”，这名员工出于报复心理，试图向社会投放这种药物。故事接下来的走向乍看出人意料，却又在情理之中——当人的所有经验都可以自由索取、无限重来，“一生一次”的体验反而变得弥足珍贵、令人心仪。
从某种意义上，我们这个世界虽然还做不到“来去自由”，但它的确是在向“平滑化”迈进。今天的人们足不出户便能接收全球资讯，轻点鼠标即可与世界另一端的人“实时互联”，更不必说种种方兴未艾的“虚拟现实”（VR）和“增强现实”（AR）技术，其实就是在为人类提供自由穿梭于平行时空的可能。然而这种“平滑”也滋生了诸多问题，譬如它的脆弱性——我们几乎无法忍受自己或是他者“不在线”或是“掉线”；再如当现实世界被置换为“屏幕世界”，“避开现实而紧盯屏幕已经成为现状。屏幕训练我们去顺应和满足现状，而我们已经开始接受这种现状并取其精华、去其糟粕”（[荷兰]诺伦·格尔茨：《虚无主义》，张红军译，商务印书馆，123页）。
基于这样的前提，英国人类学家蒂姆·英戈尔德的这部《线的文化史》今天读来格外有趣。由人类的制线行为（line-making）入手，英戈尔德考察了“线”作为一种现象，在人类实践中的存在及其演变。在他看来，作为主体的“实线”曾经是人…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've been using Linux since 2017 as my main OS until my old laptop stopped working last year and I had to buy another one. My choice was the Galaxy Book S - but my nightmare started when I arrived home and tried to install Ubuntu on it. For some reason, the installer couldn't recognize any disk, and the same issue appeared over and over, no matter which distro I tried to use. 
 After some research I found out that this model does not use a regular SSD, but an eUFS instead (I've never heard about it before, apparently it is often used within smartphones). Since then, I'm stuck in Windows. Ubuntu sometimes recognizes it but it's never able to finish installation, the disk always disappears before it.
 Does anyone have any idea of how to solve it? I've been thinking in some way to install just a "windows-skeleton-alike" with no visual system, just code, and install a virtual machine with Ubuntu above it, but I'm not sure if this is even a possibility.
 I do not like using Windows at all, and I don't know what to do anymore. Unfortunately selling it and buying another is not an option at the moment.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[这篇初学者指南解释了在 Ubuntu、Linux Mint 和 Windows 中升级到最新 LibreOffice 所需的步骤。




LibreOffice 被全球数百万用户使用，是当今最流行的免费办公套件。它由电子表格程序 （Calc）、文档处理器（Writer）、演示文稿（Impress）、绘图（Draw）和数学模块组成，可帮助你完成大部分办公、商务、学术和日常工作。

由于与 DOCX、PPTX 和 XLSX 等专有文件格式兼容，LibreOffice 可以作为付费的微软 Office 套件的出色替代品。它是 Apache OpenOffice 生产力套件的一个分支，由数以千计的全球贡献者积极开发。



升级到最新的 LibreOffice

LibreOffice 改变了它的版本命名方式，不再采用"Fresh"和"Still"的概念。现在，LibreOffice 有一个社区版和一个推荐的企业版。这是因为许多企业使用带有最新功能的最新 LibreOffice 版本，这对开发工作造成了阻碍。因此，团队建议企业用户从 LibreOffice 官方合作伙伴那里获得付费支持，以获得长期支持。你可以在 此处 阅读博文。

以下是当前的版本：

最新的 LibreOffice 版本


当前的 LibreOffice 社区版本系列是 LibreOffice 7.4.x。

LibreOffice 稳定推荐的商业版本是 LibreOffice 7.3.x。


在 Ubuntu、Linux Mint 和其他基于 Ubuntu 的发行版中升级到最新的 LibreOffice

Ubuntu 22.04 LTS Jammy Jellyfish 具有 LibreOffice 7.3.x。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Over on the Software Freedom Conservancy blog, Policy Fellow and Hacker-in-Residence Bradley M. Kuhn analyzes the recent changes to Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) source availability in light of the GPL.  It contains some interesting information about two alleged GPL violations that came about because the company's business model is structured in a way that brings it too close to non-compliance with the license, he said:

Perhaps the biggest problem with a murky business model that skirts the line of GPL compliance is that violations can and do happen — since even a minor deviation from the business model clearly violates the GPL agreements. Pre-IBM Red Hat deserves a certain amount of credit, as SFC is aware of only two documented incidents of GPL violations that have occurred since 2006 regarding the RHEL business model. We've decided to share some general details of these violations for the purpose of explaining where this business model can so easily cross the line.

[...] In another violation incident, we learned that Red Hat, in a specific non-USA country, was requiring that any customer who lowered the number of RHEL machines under service contract with Red Hat sign an additional agreement. This additional agreement promised that the customer had deleted every copy of RHEL in their entire organization other than the copies of RHEL that were currently contracted for service with Red Hat. Again, this is a "further restriction". The GPL agreements give everyone the unfettered right to make and keep as many copies of the software as they like, and a distributor of GPL'd software may not require a user to attest that they've deleted these legitimate, licensed copies of third-party-licensed software under the GPL. SFC informed Red Hat's legal department of this violation, and we were assured that this additional agreement would no longer be presented to any Red Hat customers in the future.]]></summary>

I think it's the best note-taking/knowledge-base/second-brain i know it virtually could link everything you posses toghter to create a gigantic wiki, so much potential.

But once you start installing other software, you run into problems which do not exist in X11: you can't watch hardware accelerated videos on Chromium and derived browsers (massive shoutout to firefox for being there), various GNOME extensions will freeze up the system (ex. Pixel saver), adwaita themes will mess up (light theme on one app, dark on another) to name a few.
 Wayland still have a long way to go , till then, X11 remains the only option if you don't want to walk on egg shells.

This code is part of the Linux INET6 implementation and is responsible for the IPv6 Address auto configuration (https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v6.2.11/source/net/ipv6/addrconf.c#L3).
 Overall, each IPv6 entity in the network needs a globally unique address for communicating outside of the local segment. In order to get such an address there are a few options: manual assignment of an address, DHCPv6 (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol version 6) and SLAAC (Stateless Address Autoconfiguration). When talking about stateless and stateful it means if there is a server/device that keep tracks of a state for each address assignment (https://www.networkac…]]></summary>

加拿大参议院周四批准了《在线新闻法案》（Online News Act），预计不久将正式通过。Meta在声明中说：“今天，我们确认，在《在线新闻法》生效之前，加拿大所有用户将无法在Facebook和Instagram上获取新闻。”


报道指出，加拿大“在线新闻法案”要求脸书和谷歌等互联网巨头付费使用当地媒体的新闻内容，这意味着加拿大成为继澳大利亚后第二个立法要求互联网公司为使用当地媒体新闻内容付费的国家。澳大利亚于 2021 年通过“新闻媒体与数字平台强制议价法案”。


谷歌对此抗议称，加拿大法律比澳大利亚更加严格，希望加拿大修改立法。多家美国互联网公司也表态称，这些立法对他们的业务造成了影响。


加拿大内阁领导人特鲁多谴责称，Meta 和谷歌在反抗这个法案时，用了“霸凌的手段”。法案的主要起草人、加拿大文化遗产部长 Pablo Rodriguez 也在声明中强调，这是加拿大民众对抗科技巨头的第一步。

在 Linux 命令行中，如何 搜索文件？你可以使用 find 命令。这是标准答案，没有问题。

通常，你键入带有搜索参数的命令，按回车键，然后它会显示搜索结果。

你可以通过模糊搜索来提升终端中的文件搜索体验。

模糊搜索是一种近似搜索算法或技术。在这种搜索中，通过名称搜索指定位置的文件，并实时显示结果给用户。

模糊搜索在网络搜索引擎中很受欢迎，用户开始输入术语后，它会开始显示与该术语相关的结果。

在本文中，我将讨论两个命令行工具，它们可以让你在 Linux 中执行模糊搜索：


fzf：模糊查找工具

fzy：模糊选择工具


fzf：Linux 中的模糊查找工具

fzf 是一款可用于 Linux 的模糊搜索工具，你可以通过它进行交互式文件搜索。

在 Ubuntu 中安装 fzf，打开终端并运行以下命令：

sudo apt install fzf


虽然 fzf 本身可以正常工作，但最好与其他工具配合使用，以充分发挥其功能。

使用 fzf

打开终端并运行：

fzf


这将打开一个 fzf 提示符，在当前工作目录中搜索文件。



为 fzf 应用边框

你可以使用 --border 选项为 fzf 应用边框，有多种边框可用，如 rounded（圆角）、sharp（尖角）等。

fzf --border=rounded




应用背景和前景颜色

使用颜色属性，你可以为 fzf 设置 ANSI 颜色，可以作为背景、前景或两者都设置。



fzf --color="bg:black,fg:yellow"


你可以串联这些选项，使 fzf 在视觉上更加美观。

现在，让我展示一些 fz…]]></summary>

They allow to make charts quickly. 
But you lose flexibility: you're limited by the options they offer.
I just created a gallery with hundreds of graphs made with d3.js and React. 
- Examples are split by graph types
- They all come with explanation and code sandboxes
- Gradual complexity to ease the learning curve
It took me ages to create this project! Feedback welcome!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[AlmaLinux 确认受到 RHEL 源代码发布变化影响

针对 昨天 红帽发布的改变 RHEL 源代码发布方式的公告，AlmaLinux 发布声明称，这将限制他们 1:1 复制 RHEL 构建的能力。因为 CentOS Stream 虽然是 RHEL 的上游，但并不总是包括 RHEL 软件包中的所有补丁和更新。想要做到完全复制，需要有 RHEL 构建版本时的源代码。而要获得该源代码，AlmaLinux 称，“不幸的是，按照我们今天的理解，红帽公司的用户界面协议表明，重新发布通过客户门户获得的资源将违反这些协议。”在短期内，他们将专注于通过跟踪 CentOS Stream 的变化和 Oracle Linux 等来为 AlmaLinux 提供安全更新。但从长远来看，他们将与其他 RHEL 下游产品和合作伙伴合作，寻找一条合适的发展道路。


消息来源：AlmaLinux



老王点评：对于这件事红帽背后的动机我们就不妄自揣测了，毕竟红帽和 AlmaLinux 曾经“建立了令人难以置信的工作关系”。但事实就是，社区构建的 AlmaLinux 想要跟上 RHEL 的构建会越来越麻烦和越来越慢。所以，你怎么看呢？




哈佛给计算机学生们配备了一位聊天机器人老师

哈佛大学将为今年秋季的计算机科学导论 CS50 课程的学生配置一位聊天机器人老师。这个聊天机器人将不使用 ChatGPT 或 GitHub Copilot，因为它们“太有帮助了”。相反，哈佛大学已经开发了自己的大型语言模型 “CS50 机器人”，它将 “具有类似的精神”，但将专注于 “引导学生找到答案，而不是将答案交给他们”。


消息来源：PCMag



老王点评：我认为哈佛大学走在了正确的道路，拥抱 AI，而不是让 AI 替代人类，让 AI 帮助学习，而不是让学生抄袭 AI 的作业。




E3 或许再也不会举办

之前，我们 报道 过，今年的 E3 2023 已经取消，这本应是 2019 年后的第一次 E3 线下盛会。现在，E3 已经取消了 2024 年和 2025 年在洛杉矶的活动。这表明有些事情阻碍了 E3 的回归，或者其组织者正在考虑将其迁出洛杉矶。

老王点评：一场大流行，改变了很多。很多事情再也回不到过去了。]]></summary>

 I have a microcontroller board on which I am opening up an MMS port. I set the board on a static IP (this is required) and I am trying to see what data I am getting on the IEDExplorer tool which works on MMS protocol.
 Now, if the system that runs the IEDExplorer tool is on a static IP of the same range (10.3.11.x) then it works, but if the system is on a dynamic IP of the range 172.x.x.x, I can ping the board but I don't see any data on the tool.
 The application that I am using is correct because it has been previously on a different Linux image and a different processor. 
 The only thing that I am suspecting is that something might be wrong with the Linux image I have built using yocto and if something can be changed about it. 
 Feel free to ask more details and I would be really glad if you can help me out as I don't see any solution at all. (Firewall is allowing all the traffic and there is no proxy)
 ​
 Thanks.

尽管我们可以将德国思想家布鲁门贝格（Hans Blumenberg，1920-1996）的学术研究视为现代欧陆哲学隐喻复兴运动的重要组成，但他的思想风格既无法完全归入胡塞尔的现象学传统，也不属于重返修辞的后哲学论说。有趣的是，倘若我们试着列一份康德之后以独特生活方式著称的思想家名单，布鲁门贝格一定位列其中。与大多数犹太裔学者一样，布鲁门贝格在二战结束后返回校园，最初在汉堡大学师从胡塞尔的助手兰德格里伯（Ludwig Landgrebe，1902-1991）学习哲学、日耳曼学和古典语文学，后跟随他转入基尔大学，并在那里获得博士学位。1947年起，布鲁门贝格辗转汉堡大学、吉森大学、波鸿鲁尔大学和明斯特大学任教，直到1985年在明斯特退休。不接受采访，不参与学术和公共活动，退休后的布鲁门贝格以哲学隐士的姿态隐居于僻静之处。这不禁让人想起康德《纯粹理性批判》的题词：“关于自己，我们宁可沉默。”（De nobis ipsis silemus. 伽达默尔也曾将这句话写在自传扉页上）

1980年，布鲁门贝格获得弗洛伊德奖时发表演说。

归隐的生活状态和晦涩的写作风格削弱了布鲁门贝格的学术知名度，但也让一部分人相当着迷，小说家西碧拉·莱维查洛夫（Sibylle Lewitscharoff）便是其中之一。布鲁门贝格深爱与狮子有关的隐喻，他在《不在场的狮子：书斋里的圣哲罗姆》（Das Abwesende am Löwen: Hieronymus im Gehäus mit Sanduhr；收录于其身后整理出版的《狮子》一书）中讨论了一头试图攻击圣哲罗姆的狮子被圣人的雄辩和哲思驯服，从此庇护其左右的故事。莱维查洛夫由此得到灵感，创作了小说《布鲁门贝格》。在小说中，狮子在某天晚上悄然出…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[到目前为止，我们已经讲解了包括 变量、可变性、常量、数据类型、函数、if-else 语句 和 循环 在内的一些关于 Rust 编程的基础知识。

在 Rust 基础系列的最后一章里，让我们现在用 Rust 编写一个程序，使用这些主题，以便更好地理解它们在现实世界中的用途。让我们来编写一个相对简单的程序，用来从水果市场订购水果。

我们程序的基本结构

来让我们首先向用户问好，并告诉他们如何与程序交互。

fn main() {
    println!("欢迎来到水果市场！");
    println!("请选择要购买的水果。\n");

    println!("\n可以购买的水果：苹果、香蕉、橘子、芒果、葡萄");
    println!("购买完成后，请输入“quit”或“q”。\n");
}


获取用户输入

上面的代码非常简单。目前，你不知道接下来该做什么，因为你不知道用户接下来想做什么。

所以让我们添加一些代码，接受用户输入并将其存储在某个地方以便稍后解析，然后根据用户输入采取适当的操作。

use std::io;

fn main() {
    println!("欢迎来到水果市场！");
    println!("请选择要购买的水果。\n");

    println!("\n可以购买的水果：苹果、香蕉、橘子、芒果、葡萄");
    println!("购买完成后，请输入“quit”或“q”。\n");

    // 获取用户输入
    let mut user_input = String::new();
    io::stdin()
        .read_line(&mut user_input)
        .expect("无法读取用户输入。");
}

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[美国联邦贸易委员会(FTC)将于周四在联邦法庭上提出初步禁令，以暂时阻止微软690亿美元（备注：当前约4954.2亿元人民币）收购动视暴雪(Activision Blizzard)。他们认为在政府作出裁决之前应该先停止交易。


微软曾表示，“临时阻止”可能会破坏这笔交易，但法院通常不会考虑这种现实后果。如果法院暂停这笔交易，微软和动视暴雪就得将其原定于7月18日终止的协议延后。


在旧金山一家联邦法官预定为期五天的听证会上，反垄断执法机构将辩称，它需要让微软公司和动视暴雪公司在联邦法院就合并案作出裁决之前暂缓该交易，因为该机构的内部法院尚未就该交易是否损害了游戏行业的竞争状况作出裁决。


FTC担心，如果没有联邦法院采取行动，两家公司的合并“可能会改变动视暴雪的运营和商业计划”，并且可能导致微软获取敏感的企业信息。


据悉，FTC内部的行政听证会定于8月2日开始，而解决美国FTC的诉讼是微软和动视暴雪在全球范围内争取完成这笔交易的关键反垄断战之一。


FTC认为，这笔交易将是微软有史以来最大的一笔交易，也是游戏业务史上最大的一笔交易。它将使微软拥有“削弱或降低动视暴雪内容的能力和动机”，从而实质性地减少竞争。


此外，FTC曾在12月份要求其内部行政法庭阻止这笔交易，并表示该合并将使微软的Xbox游戏机独占动视暴雪游戏，而任天堂和索尼会被排除在外。


微软曾表示，这笔交易将有利于游戏玩家和游戏公司双方的利益，并已向FTC提出签署具有法律约束力的同意书，承诺在未来十年内向包括索尼在内的竞争对手提供“使命召唤”游戏。


听证会将于6月22日开始，持续到6月29日。微软首席执行官萨蒂亚・纳德拉(Satya Nadella)和动视暴雪首席执行官鲍比・科迪克(Bobby Kotick)等高管都将作为证人出庭作证。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So I've had a Lenovo Yoga 2 pro (2013) that I've had Ubuntu and mint on previously installed. It came with windows 8, but it has issues related to windows 10 so I tried Linux. Both mint and Ubuntu worked initially for awhile, but eventually both hit a point where the track pad stops responding until I do a full reinstall. I also noticed that the fans seemed to run higher more often than windows. I'm curious if another distro would fix these problems or if it just isn't going to work. 
 I'd use it mainly for hobby programming/browsing, and to learning Linux more. If it's futile also looking for laptop suggestions for replacements in the future.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Openbox 是一款适用于 Linux 的轻量级、可配置的窗口堆叠式管理器。它支持许多标准，适用于任何桌面环境。

可能让你惊讶的是，LXDE 和 LXQT 桌面环境都是基于 Openbox 构建的。你甚至可以用它替换桌面环境的窗口管理器。

当然，你几乎可以在任何 Linux 发行版上安装 Openbox。不过，配置它需要时间和精力。

一个更简单的方法是使用提供 Openbox 变种的发行版。在本文中，我列出了一些能够让你轻松体验 Openbox 的发行版。

注意： 列表按字母顺序排列，不代表排名。

1、Archcraft



如果你想体验 Openbox 窗口管理器，Archcraft 是一个不错的选择。不像其他发行版，Openbox 是这个发行版的默认桌面环境，所以你可以期待它的表现优秀。

它提供了一个精简且轻量的环境，只需不到 500MB 的内存即可运行，而且外观上也没有降级。其界面元素风格统一。

你可以通过简单点击来切换主题，如果你喜欢，它还提供了类似 Windows 的用户界面。

对于资深用户来说，它内置了对 AUR 和 Chaotic-AUR 的支持。与其他发行版不同的是，它提供了最佳的开箱即用体验。


Archcraft


2、ArcolinuxB Openbox



如果你想学习 Arch（Arcolinux 项目的主要目标），ArcolinuxB Openbox 是一个非常优秀的 Linux 桌面发行版。

它是 ArcolinuxB 项目的众多变种之一。你可能会遇到一些学习曲线和不完善的地方。

与 Archcraft 不同，你在这里不会看到完全统一的界面元素，可能需要进行一些调整来获得良好的体验。


ArcolinuxB


3、AV Linux MX Edition

I found a way to disable the title bar on windows using the win32 api and it works perfectly. I’m now trying to do the same thing on linux while still been able to resize the window and rounded corners.
 I can already get the window and the display with 
 Display* display = glfwGetX11Display(); Window x11Window = glfwGetX11Window(window);
 Any help would be appreciated :)

 Alternative but more accurate title. Hackers installed software and did bad stuff on already compromised systems running a shitty and obscure Linux derivative used for crypto bro mining. It is unclear how they even got access.
 In other news, Microsoft Azure, outlook 365, and Azure SQL server have all been hacked and lost customer data in the past year.

So I am curious what are some interesting educational resources for people in more advanced engineering roles? Courses or resources that might help one move to an Architect or Principal/Staff role?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The AlmaLinux organization has posted a message
describing the impact of Red Hat's decision to stop releasing the source to
the RHEL distribution and how AlmaLinux will respond.


	In the immediate term, our plan is to pull from CentOS Stream
	updates and Oracle Linux updates to ensure security patches
	continue to be released. These updates will be carefully curated to
	ensure they are 1:1 compatible with RHEL, while not violating Red
	Hat’s licensing, and will be vetted and tested just like all of our
	other releases.


Update: Rocky Linux has also sent out a
release on the subject.  "There will be no disruption or change for
any Rocky Linux users, collaborators, or partners".]]></summary>

I installed Ubuntu, Fedora, Linux Mint, Pop!_OS, Manajro, Arch Linux, Debian, Vanilla OS, etc. In all of them I had problems with overheating, no iGPU usage resulting in Twitch dropping frames like crazy and other problems. I will be switching to a PC soon and I wanted to clean the iMac, change the hard drive, reapply thermal paste and install Linux but this problems always persists. Any idea?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[RHEL 源代码将只放在 CentOS Stream 上

在没有宣布废弃 CentOS 之前，RHEL 的源代码会发布在 git.centos.org 上，那时候 CentOS 还是 RHEL 的下游。之后，在 CentOS Stream 成为 RHEL 的上游后，该仓库得以保留。红帽宣布，“CentOS Stream 将成为公开发布 RHEL 相关源代码的唯一仓库。对于红帽的客户和合作伙伴，源代码将继续通过红帽客户门户网站提供。”并进一步澄清，“这一变化并不意味着CentOS 项目、CentOS Stream 或 CentOS SIG 的源代码可用性有任何变化。”但这一举动引来了社区的一些人的担心，“Alma Linux，Rocky Linux，Oracle Linux 等将更难提供与 RHEL 版本 1:1 的二进制兼容的构建。”


消息来源：Phoronix



老王点评：我认为，从目前的声明上看，这种担心或许是多余的，我们只需要观察之后的 RHEL 和 CentOS Stream 之间差异有多大就好了。但从对这个事情的反应可以看出，社区对红帽的信任在降低。




Reddit 用户涌入 Lemmy

类似马斯克收购 Twitter 后 Twitter 难民涌入 Mastodon，大量 Reddit 难民涌入了 Lemmy 实例。其中，lemmy.world 实例的总用户数达到了 3.8 万。突然间，Lemmy 已经成为最大的联邦宇宙项目之一。在 Reddit 社区重新开放之后，部分用户可能会离开，但也许有更多用户会留下。


消息来源：Lemmy



老王点评：这些联邦宇宙社区会得到更多用户，但 Twitter、Reddit 失血更多。




C++ 26 标准正在制定中

C++ 版本以其发布的年份命名，并遵循三年的周期。国际标准化组织 C++ 标准委员会发布了 C++ 26 的进展情况。根据其时间表，新语言功能的截止日期是 2024 年第三季度，功能冻结将在 2025 年第一季度。委员会已经通过了 40 份 “修改文件”，增加了 _ 字符通配符，基本字符集添加了 @、$ 和 `。此外，在 C++ 26 中还支持了危险指针。危险指针是指 “只有其所有者可以设置其值，而任何数量的线程都可以读取其值” 的指针，它很难导致非常常见的内存安全问题。


消息来源：Dev Class



老王点评：在我看来，C++ 标准的演进有一定的意义，但是这并不能阻止其传统的领域被 Rust、Carbon 等新底层语言的侵蚀。]]></summary>

 I have T440p laptop on which i installed OpenSuse TW. I can only use it with external monitor because the built in screen wont turn on. I tried installing Nvidia drivers with Yast - and i did it - nothing special.
 But laptop is always using the iGPU (which i read online is the cause of the problem). Also using YAST i installed bbswitch and bumblebee, nvidia and suse prime and what not - but nothing is helping. I would like to be able to use the laptop on the go and without the external monitor. 
 Does anyone know how to fix this, because i really want to learn Linux and use it for school and am also switching from windows - but i spen almost two months trying to solve the problem without success. Thank you for your help in advance and see you

An old laptop, and i wanted to make it alive again, I found out that the battery is dead, and im not planning to replace it. Replaced the hard thermal paste on both gpu and cpus, then i tried running it with only the charger. I remember upgrading it from windows 7 to windows 10. It booted up successfully. After using it for some minutes, It just powers off. I have an inference that it is caused by the temperature, i tried turning on power saver and did almost everything to minimize the temperature in use. Then i decided to swtich the operating system to linux, xubuntu. Downloaded the media files, making a bootable drive to install, and then its now successfully installed with no interruptions. I ran the laptop on its coolest before I installed xubuntu. After the installation, the laptop is cooking, same temp before when trying windows 10. I tried to update and upgrade packages, after waiting for some time (it was like 33% don) the laptop just powered off. Same issue before, its got the cooking temp, still dont know the numbers, but it is really hot. I decided to install lm sensors after i booted up the system, lowered the brightness. I dont see any power consumption related settings other than sleep mode, display power management etc. Its currently idle for about half an hour, 51.0°c, 53.0°c (core 1 and 2). I will wait for it to measure if it can stay longer when idle. Ill test later when in-use.
 I wanted to know if there are any methods that can help reduce the temperature of my laptop using the os or fiddling with the computer's configuration.
 Thank you!

美国学者莎拉·罗伯茨（Sarah T. Roberts）被誉为“数字时代的先锋研究者”，她在2010-2018年长达八年的时间里持续展开了对互联网公司中的商业性内容审核员群体的工作状况及生存环境的访谈调查与实例研究，《幕后之人：社交媒体时代的内容审核》（原书名Behind the Screen:Content Moderation in the Shadows of Social Media，2019）是一部具有开创性的互联网田野调查与社会学研究的专著。作者的调查对象与研究主题指向全球性的商业化社交媒体的内容审核运作：针对互联网上日益巨量而良莠混杂的内容，商业性内容审核是必要的工作，因此互联网公司要雇用数以百万计的内容审核员评估社交平台用户上传的信息，筛选和删除色情、暴力、仇恨言论等不良内容。但是由于各种原因，这个工作群体一直隐身于幕后，其游离于社会、薪资低微、劳累过度、精神创伤等生存状况亦一直未能引起社会关注与疗救。莎拉·罗伯茨克服了互联网公司保密协议、地域限制等重重困难，对从硅谷到菲律宾、从专业审核公司到主要社交媒体的一线员工进行了深度采访，全面考察、分析了互联网商业性内容审核工作的不同类型（短期合同工、专业公司、外包、零工）及作为“幕后之人”的审核员群体的工作与生存状况，同时也对内容审核与相关政策争议、对现实影响的关系进行了分析和阐述。“打开了一扇了解内容审核这一晦暗不明世界的窗口。……是数字经济这一关键领域的权威著作，必将影响未来几年的政策和研究。”联合国特别报告员大卫·凯依（David Kaye）对该书的这一评语是客观、中肯的。

黄宾虹曾跋：“巨然墨法自米氏父子、高房山、吴仲圭一脉相承，学者宗之，及董玄宰用兼皴带染法，娄东、虞山日益凌替，至道咸为之中兴。”（图一）黄宾虹从道光、咸丰年间金石碑学之昌盛中寻到了中国画变革的动力，以“道咸画学中兴说”批判自宋以降落向窠臼的传统艺术，在二十世纪上半叶掀起了一场以北宋为宗的中国画“文艺复兴”。在深空探测和AI技术获得突破性发展的二十一世纪二十年代，再次回溯百余年前中国画坛的风云变幻，我们有理由以更广阔的眼光观想一张与十九至二十世纪之际世界艺术之现代主义运动同构的中国画史图景。我们业已建立寻常的画史共识：清末绘画流于程式，日渐凌替，以黄宾虹、齐白石为代表的一批先锋者将中国画从陈陈相因的泥淖中解放出来，就此开创了二十世纪中国画的现代主义。

倘若我们将这一阶段视为中国画之现代性的起点，那么在百余年之后，我们是否能够，哪怕是在极为宽泛的层面上界说出中国画的后现代主义、解构主义？后现代在西方的生发有其具体的语境，将其去语境地附会在中国显然不是科学的思量，但唯独不可否认的是，这些“先锋的时髦语汇”被利用在当代中国极其繁荣的艺术活动中，可每每回归到作品——画面内部，我们的内心是否会不可避免地引发一丝对作者所宣称的思想的忧疑。形式与内容的不自洽使得我们在总体上很难坚定地否认，当代的中国画并没有完全摆脱、超越由现代主义者——黄宾虹、潘天寿诸家代表的世代所开创的“纪元”，即便我们已经走过了西方艺术史断代的现代主义时期。中国画的题材、创作手段、艺术形式较百余年前早已大相径庭，可为什么还要做出如此扫兴的论断？重大问题的症结首先并不出在方法、技术、媒材甚至概念上，而是归咎于深刻的意识层面，至少，中国画面对自…]]></summary>

当你习惯于一个操作系统时，很容易将其他操作系统看作是“应用程序”。如果你在桌面上使用一种操作系统，你可能会认为另一种操作系统是人们用来运行服务器的应用程序，而又一种操作系统是用来玩游戏的应用程序，依此类推。有时我们会忘记操作系统是计算机管理无数任务的部分（从技术上讲，每秒数百万个任务），它们通常设计成能够执行各种任务。当有人问我 Linux 能做什么 时，我通常会问他们想让它做什么。这没有一个单一的答案，所以这里有五个让我惊讶的 Linux 用途。

1、用 Linux 进行激光切割



在离我最近的创客空间里，有一台巨大的工业机器，大约和一张沙发一样大小，可以根据一个简单的线条图设计文件来切割各种材料。这是一台强大的激光切割机，令我惊讶的是，我第一次使用它时发现它只需要通过 USB 线连接到我的 Linux 笔记本电脑上。事实上，在许多方面，与许多台式打印机相比，连接这台激光切割机更容易，因为许多台式打印机需要过于复杂和臃肿的驱动程序。

使用 Inkscape 和 一个简单的插件，你可以为这台工业激光切割机设计切割线条。你可以为你的树莓派笔记本设计一个外壳，使用这些知识共享的设计方案来建造 一个密码锁盒、切割一个店面标牌，或者你心目中的其他任何想法。而且，你可以完全使用开源软件来完成这些操作。

2、在 Linux 上进行游戏



开源游戏一直都有，最近一段时间也有一些备受瞩目的 Linux 游戏。我建造的第一台游戏电脑就是一台 Linux 电脑，我觉得我邀请过来一起玩沙发合作游戏的人们都没有意识到他们是在 Linux 上进行游戏。这是一种流畅顺滑的体验，而且取决于你愿意在硬件上花费多少，可能上无止境吧。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[6月21日消息，亿欧网创始人黄渊普发布一封举报信，实名举报全国政协委员、知乎创始人兼CEO周源恶意挑拨员工群体与企业主群体对立、严重破坏国内营商环境。黄渊普表示，恳请有关部门介入，调查我所说的情况；我愿意协助调查和调研，为有关部门提供必要的材料和证据。


以下为公开信全文：



黄渊普：实名举报全国政协委员、知乎创始人兼CEO周源恶意挑拨员工群体与企业主群体对立、严重破坏国内营商环境


尊敬的相关部门领导，我叫黄渊普，作为主要创始人做了一家叫“亿欧”《北京亿欧网盟科技有限公司》的小公司，籍贯为湖南邵阳，户籍所在地在上海市长宁区，身份证号43052719xx10xx42xx，联系方式为：15810157304。我今天实名举报全国政协委员、知乎〔北京智者天下科技有限公司，简称“知乎”）创始人兼CEO周源通过其创立的知乎平台、设置不合理的机制恶意挑拨了员工群体与企业主群体对立、严重破坏了国内营商环境。


以下为我的陈述，我对我所说的话负责；


2023年6月20日上午，在听到一位创业者朋友抱怨自己在知乎平台上被人匿名诽谤的事情后，我也在知乎上搜索了一下自己的名字“黄渊普”。发现一个“提问”（目前知乎上已经被删）∶亿欧黄渊普会卷钱跑路吗？


这个提问由知乎的匿名用户以匿名的方式提出。但其实，亿欧是科创产业智库，商业模式主要是给科技企业提供研究、咨询、品牌等服务，主营业务应收账款较大，只有占营收非常小的会员和VIP服务采取先付款后提供服务的方式。


这个提问和描述十分恶意，把我本人与某不同行业领域的企业负责人做恶意对比。这个提问，在我发现它之前，它应该已经存在一段时间（知乎的“提问”不对外显示提问时间）。在我发现这个提问之前，它对我个人名誉已经造成了损害，对公司品牌和人才招聘也有不利影响。


这不是我第一次在知乎上遭遇这类匿名提问和匿…]]></summary>

 If we look at professional use and sum up the % of the platforms, it doesn't add up to 100%.
 Wouldn't WSL under Windows be considered Windows?
 If we add all the Linux distros together then the % is the highest?
 If we add up the responses of Linux distros, it's ~47.5k which is higher than the responses for Windows - why did they list Windows as the most used platform?
 Why didn't they group Linux under a single category?
 Not sure how to interpret the results here, any ideas?

 I've tried copying several ways:
  
cp
 rsync
 tar cf - [source] | (cd [destination]; tar xfp -)
 Nemo gui file transfer
  
Each time I get the same result, the first file transfers quickly at ~200 MB/s, and then slows to ~15 MB/s for subsequent files. Except nemo which is just terribly slow from the beginning. I don't know how to troubleshoot the cause of the slowdown any further and would appreciate any suggestions you might have. thanks!

I have googled everywhere about this and can't find anything. I should also mention that I had it working perfectly fine before it had no issue downloading, but then I wanted to move the folder and it is just not accepting it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello Hacker News community,
Wanted to share a project I started working on during my spare time and was then discovered by many in the open source community last week.
GPT Engineer’s mission:
Be the open platform for devs to tinker with and build their personal code-generation toolbox.
I believe it's key for us devs to engage in how building software can and will change.
You can find more info about the flexible technical "philosophy" to make it work well, and the community we want it to become on github:
https://github.com/AntonOsika/gpt-engineer
The project is still in early stages. It's clear that there is a lot of room for improvement as the space to combine tricks that guide LLM's is large.
Appreciate any suggestions, experiences, or ideas on the project from you all!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Kernel support for copy offload is a feature that has been floating around
in limbo for a decade or more at this point; it has been implemented along 
the way, but never merged.  The idea is that the host
system can simply ask a block storage device to copy some data within the device
and it 
will do so without further involving the host; instead of reading data into
the host so that it can be written back out again, the device circumvents
that process.  At the
2023 Linux Storage, Filesystem,
Memory-Management and BPF Summit, Nitesh Shetty led a storage and
filesystem session to discuss the current status of a patch set that he and
others have been working on, with an
eye toward getting something merged fairly soon.]]></summary>

 I have several nvme devices in my Ubuntu 22.04.02 machine and I'd like to manually calculate the write amplification of each device by dividing nand_bytes_written / host_bytes_written.
 I believe host_bytes_written can be calculated in the following manner:

 The above can be proven by using dd:
 $ nvme smart-log /dev/nvme0n1 |grep -e data_units_written data_units_written : 32,800,047 $ dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/nvme0n1 bs=512000 count=1000 oflag=direct 1000+0 records in 1000+0 records out 512000000 bytes (512 MB, 488 MiB) copied, 0.967242 s, 529 MB/s $ nvme smart-log /dev/nvme0n1 |grep -e data_units_written data_units_written : 32,801,047 <--…]]></summary>

 By limiting the RHEL public sources to CentOS Stream, it will now be more difficult for community/off-shoot enterprise Linux distributions like Alma Linux, Rocky Linux, Oracle Linux, etc, to provide 1:1 binary compatible builds against given RHEL releases.
 Seems like another move to kill off Alma or Rocky

is still not as easy as on x86 systems because many Arm devices require a

components. One distribution that addresses this problem is Armbian, which offers Debian- and
Ubuntu-based distributions for
many devices. The headline feature in the recent release, Armbian
23.05, which came at the end of May, is a major rework of the build

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've been contemplating a switch from ArchLinux to Ubuntu and had a couple of concerns regarding Snap apps and package installation. I've heard mixed opinions about the startup speed of Snap apps in Ubuntu and wanted to know if it's a common issue or something that can be optimized. Additionally, I've come across comments stating that Ubuntu pushes users to install software exclusively through snaps, rather than using traditional deb packages. Is this true, and are there any limitations or drawbacks to this approach?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[据美联社报道，Twitter（推特）员工昨日向旧金山联邦法院提起诉讼，要求该公司兑现有关奖金的承诺。


员工们表示，在马斯克收购该公司之前的一个月里，包括前首席财务官内德・西格尔（Ned Segal）在内的高管“一再”向员工承诺，将支付他们 2022 年奖金的 50%。但随着马斯克的到来，这些关于奖金的承诺至今没有落地。


此次诉讼案件的首席原告马克・肖宾格（Mark Schobinger）是上月刚从 Twitter 离职的前薪酬高级总监，他的律师正代表 Twitter 现员工和前员工寻求集体诉讼。原告律师香农・利斯・赖尔丹（Shannon Liss-Riordan）表示，Twitter 所欠奖金达到“数千万美元”。


已经被马斯克解散媒体关系团队的 Twitter 除了自动回复外，没有就此给出其他回复评论。


此前报道，马斯克收购 Twitter 后一直在进行包括大幅裁员在内的各种成本压缩政策，这也导致该公司正面临来自前雇员的多起诉讼，以及众多尚未支付的账单。此前 Twitter 被曝出拒绝支付即将到期的谷歌云账单，并因拖欠房租被驱逐出位于美国科罗拉多州博尔德市的办公室。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[DeepMind 联合创始人提出新图灵测试

阿兰·图灵在 1950 年代提出了最早的对 AI 的测试，人类评估者判断他们是在和人类还是与 AI 说话。如果 AI 能冒充人类，那么它就通过了图灵测试。DeepMind 联合创始人 Mustafa Suleyman 在其新书中否定了传统的图灵测试，因为“它没有告诉我们系统能做什么或理解什么，是否建立了复杂的内心独白，或能在抽象的时间范围内进行规划”。他提出了新的图灵测试，“让 AI 将 10 万美元的种子基金变成 100 万美元，以此衡量 AI 是否具有类人的智能”。AI 需要研究一个电商方案，制定产品计划，找到制造商和销售商品。他预测 AI 将在两年内实现这一目标：“我们不只关心机器能说什么，我们还关心它能做什么。”


消息来源：Business Insider



老王点评：之前我们在 #1036 报道过，AI 撰写的商业计划书获得了更多投资人的青睐，我就谈到或许以后可以直接投资 AI 管理运营的企业。现在看起来，这个日子不会太远。不过，要是 AI 都会自己赚钱了，可以自己养自己了，还要人类干啥？




OpenAI 准备建立 AI 应用商店

据透露，OpenAI 正在考虑推出一个应用市场，客户可以将他们根据自己的需要定制的人工智能模型出售给其他企业。例如，可以发现在线零售交易中的金融欺诈，或回答有关特定市场的最新信息的模型。目前还不清楚 OpenAI 是否会对这些销售收取佣金，或者以其他方式从市场上获得收入。


消息来源：The Information



老王点评：有苹果应用商店的成功在前，这真是一个聪明的主意。不过我更倾向于将来会有 AI 自己使用的一种交易机制，AI 们可以在其中交易训练数据、模型权重和特定的模型等，并通过买来或学到的“技能”换取更多的交易机会。




微软计划淘汰原生的邮件和日历应用引来批评

微软打算关闭其时常被人诟病的邮件和日历应用程序，将其功能放到新的 Windows 版 Outlook 中。然而，尽管多年来用户对这些应用程序提出了一些批评，但对上述决定有一些强烈的负面反应。有用户评论，“看到微软为 Windows 开发网络应用，却为安卓、iOS 和 MacOS 打造高质量的原生应用，这有点搞笑，但也很悲哀。”用户认为淘汰邮件和日历的决定是对 WinUI 原生工具包的信心丧失，“如果你不能将 UWP 应用程序移植到本地工具包，这基本上就是承认没有人应该建立原生 Windows 应用程序。甚至微软也不使用他们自己的工具包。”


消息来源：The Register



老王点评：虽然邮件和日历应用有点鸡肋，但是连微软都不在自己的 Windows 上开发原生的应用，而用网络应用敷衍——这恐怕不完全是因为网络应用更流行，也是原生应用走衰的趋势吧。]]></summary>

Open For All，LLUG 经验与你共享

LLUG 举办的初衷是希望让大家可以从线上重归线下，与更多的人可以当面交流，迸发出灵感和创新的火花。而我们自己的力量是薄弱的，不足以支撑足够高频和多次的线下活动，我们希望有更多的人可以参与到线下活动的组织过程中。

所以，我们将我们的活动举办经验开放出来，方便有志于组织线下活动的同好们，可以和我们一起组织线下活动，促进更多的线下交流和沟通。

你可以在 https://github.com/Linux-CN/LLUG-Guides/tree/main 找到我们开放出来的 LLUG 活动组织手册，并参考手册，组织你自己的线下活动。

当然，在组织线下活动过程中，如果你认为手册有值得优化的点，也期待你能参与到项目的贡献当中，我们一起共建一个更好的活动组织手册。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[使用 Bash 中的 for 循环，为网页创建一个方便的调色板。


当计算机显示器的调色板有限时，网页设计师通常使用一组 Web 安全颜色 来创建网站。虽然在较新设备上显示的现代网站可以显示比最初的 Web 安全调色板更多的颜色，但我有时喜欢在创建网页时参考 Web 安全颜色。这样我就知道我的网页在任何地方都看起来不错。

你可以在网上找到 Web 安全调色板，但我想拥有自己的副本以方便参考。你也可以使用 Bash 中的 for 循环创建一个。

Bash for 循环

Bash 中的 for 循环 的语法如下所示：

for 变量 in 集合 ; do 语句 ; done


例如，假设你想打印从 1 到 3 的所有数字。你可以快速在 Bash 命令行上编写一个 for 循环来为你完成这项工作：

$ for n in 1 2 3 ; do echo $n ; done
1
2
3


分号是标准的 Bash 语句分隔符。它们允许你在一行中编写多个命令。如果你要在 Bash 脚本文件中包含这个 for 循环，你可以用换行符替换分号并像这样写出 for 循环：

for n in 1 2 3
  do
    echo $n
  done


我喜欢将 do 和 for 放在同一行，这样我更容易阅读：

for n in 1 2 3 ; do
  echo $n
done


一次多个 for 循环

你可以将一个循环放在另一个循环中。这可以帮助你迭代多个变量，一次做不止一件事。假设你想打印出字母 A、B 和 C 与数字 1、2 和 3 的所有组合。你可以在 Bash 中使用两个 for 循环来实现，如下所示：

#!/bin/bash
for number in 1 2 3 ; do
  for letter …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[《清代武科考试研究》，李林著，中华书局2022年12月出版，548页，168.00元

李林先生所著《清代武科考试研究》（以下简称“李著”）终于在2022年底出版了。该书一经面世，即在科举学界赢得一片赞誉。几个月来，我认真拜读了“李著”，深感这是一部超越以往研究清代武举制度的上乘之作，可谓是后来居上。
一
“李著”是在其博士论文基础上修改完成的。2014年，我曾赴香港中文大学参加李林的博士论文答辩，了解原稿的情况。现在的成果较之九年前的博士论文《“干城之选”——清代武举制度之设计、运作及其功效》，已在史料、论证、数字统计等多方面有了新的突破。一部博士论文经八年之久的修改才出版，这是不多见的，可见作者用功之勤。这八年，他坚持不懈，不断补充，不断完善（其间，我曾两次询问，他都回答还在修改之中），最终使该书在研究的深度、广度上都有了大幅度的提升，至少让我感觉是面目一新。
人们之所以赞誉“李著”，是因为以往研究武举考试的不多，特别是从制度层面研究的则更少，“李著”恰恰填补了这一空白。武科研究成果较少，原因有二。一是在科举时代，武科不如文科地位重要，在社会上的影响更是远不及文科。况且科举选官只是入仕之选，今后的升迁则靠个人的能力。文官靠官场上的政绩，武官则靠战场上的军功，因此对于武科出身者而言，军功更重于出身（“李著”也充分论述了这一点）。文科出身而统率军队者不乏其人。如康熙三十九年进士年羹尧于雍正初任抚远大将军，主持西北军务，平定罗卜藏丹津叛乱，有《年大将军兵法》传世。雍正时的著名军事将领张广泗、岳钟琪，均非武举出身。因为武科一直不受重视，研究者当然也就不多。二是武科留下的史料远不及文科那么丰富，这也造成武科研究的一定困难，让人望而止步。最早研究清代科举制度的专著是商衍鎏先生的《清代科举考试述录》，全书共八章，该书只是在第五章第一节讲武科，简单介绍了武童试、武乡试、武会试、武殿试。…]]></summary>

 As you may know, we went dark for over a week to protest a recent change announced by reddit.
 Here is a link to what is happening and why we went dark: https://www.reddit.com/r/ModCoord/comments/1476fkn/reddit_blackout_2023_save_3rd_party_apps/
 ​
  
Apollo made 7 billion requests last month, which would put it at about 1.7 million dollars per month, or 20 million US dollars per year. Even if I only kept subscription users, the average Apollo user uses 344 requests per day, which would cost $2.50 per month, which is over double what the subscription currently costs, so I'd be in the red every month.
  
We have received a message from the Admin team basically demanding that we stop the protest of the recent API changes or we will be removed: https://i.imgur.com/s7kM6j5.png
 The mod team is currently discussing ways to continue participating in the API protest without putting the subreddit at risk. A few ways that other subreddits have implemented are:
  
One day a week blackouts
 
Banning a specific letter and removing posts/comments that include that letter
 
Marking the subreddit as NSFW since this is all motivated by maximizing advertising revenue for their upcoming IPO
 
 ​
 The list of demands that need to be addressed as a result of this change: https://www.reddit.com/r/ModCoord/comments/148ks6u/indefinite_blackout_next_steps_polling_your/jo0pqzk/
 Please share your feedback and any suggestions you may have for showing our support to 3rd party apps and scripts that will be negatively impacted by this API change.

Or running a restaurant without looking at the price of your ingredients. Or constructing homes without looking at the price of raw materials... you get the idea.
That lack of transparency would be frightening, but hey, things could still work out, right?
Well, let's up the difficulty.
Imagine that, on top of not knowing exactly how much you were paying for your inputs, you also didn't know if you would have consistent and continued access to your wholesaler, your food supplier, or your building materials. That would almost certainly induce high blood pressure, stomach ulcers, and mild insomnia.

We built Autolabel because access to clean, labeled data is a huge bottleneck for most ML/data science teams. The most capable LLMs are able to label data with high accuracy, and at a fraction of the cost and time compared to manual labeling. With Autolabel, you can leverage LLMs to label any text dataset with https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36409201

is handled by the stable maintainers or the developers of the fixes.
However, due 
to some unhappiness in the XFS development
community with the process of handling stable fixes for that filesystem,
a different process has come about for backporting XFS patches to the
stable kernels.  The three developers doing that work, Leah Rumancik, Amir
Goldstein, and Chandan Babu Rajendra, led a plenary session at the 
2023 Linux Storage, Filesystem,
Memory-Management and BPF Summit  (with Rajendra
participating remotely)  to discuss that process.]]></summary>
