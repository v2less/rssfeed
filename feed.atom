 I broke my Manjaro-kde. I love Manjaro-kde, but, now that I'm not fettered to it (since I broke it (don't ask lol)) should I go with tumbleweed? 
 I've used Linux since 1998, stuck with kubuntu for many years. Almost went with tumbleweed but for one little program couldn't use, loved it otherwise. Then have stuck with Manjaro-kde for the last several years. I've always had that little desire to try tumbleweed again, especially since that one program is no longer a necessity. 
 So, what say you group, tumbleweed better than Manjaro?

We’re building Vellum (https://www.vellum.ai), a developer platform for building on LLMs like OpenAI’s GPT-3 and Anthropic’s Claude. We provide tools for efficient prompt engineering, semantic search, performance monitoring, and fine-tuning, helping you bring LLM-powered features from prototype to production.
The MLOps industry has matured rapidly for traditional ML (typically open-source models hosted in-house), but companies using LLMs are suffering from a lack of tooling to support things like experimentation, version control, and monitoring. They’re forced to build these tools themselves, taking valuable engineering time away from their core product.

With Sorbay, you can easily record your screen, camera, and microphone all at once. It is a complete solution that comes with its own backend service, allowing you to instantly share a link of your recording as soon as it is finished. The video is streamed directly to the backend service as the recording happens to make this possible.
With both founders based in different countries, we needed a tool to quickly share screen recordings to keep us up to date or to ask for feedback. Meetings are cool if you need to discuss something deeply, but for almost everything else a quick recording works better.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A few months ago, I benchmarked FastAPI on an i9 MacBook Pro. I couldn't believe my eyes. A primary REST endpoint to `sum` two integers took 6 milliseconds to evaluate. It is okay if you are targeting a server in another city, but it should be less when your client and server apps are running on the same machine.
FastAPI would have bottleneck-ed the inference of our lightweight UForm neural networks recently trending on HN under the title "Beating OpenAI CLIP with 100x less data and compute". (Thank you all for the kind words!) So I wrote another library.
It has been a while since I have written networking libraries, so I was eager to try the newer io_uring networking functionality added by Jens Axboe in kernel 5.19. TLDR: It's excellent! We used pre-registered buffers and re-allocated fil…]]></summary>

 It's serene and you've got an entire drive to fill. What software should you install? Where should you install it? What will you change about this installation in comparison to the last? What did you learn from your last installation that you can apply to this new one?
 Even when I ran Windows (or macOS), I had this feeling. Even minor things like changing the folder layout for easier access of files, installing one program which dose multiple tasks to avoid bloat, setting stipulations and goals for the current install. Every good OS should make you feel like a kid in a candy store on startup, and then make you feel like Tony Stark after you've used it for awhile. 
 I like always feeling like it's a brand new computer, even though it's the same hardware I've used for YEARS!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[走出混乱，Rust 项目公布新的治理结构

一年多前，我们在 #464 报道过，Rust 项目发生了一次非常公开的内讧，它的整个审核团队辞职了，并公开发表了对核心团队的嘲讽，“除了他们自己，不对任何人负责”。这件事之后，该项目内部普遍认为需要建立一个更好的正式治理结构，以消除其中的一些模糊和冲突，并有机制来处理这些。最初的 Rust 项目治理结构是从 Mozilla 演变而来的，包括核心、语言、审核、库和 cargo 等六个团队。旧模式的权责存在模糊的地方，问题之一是，核心团队不仅要负责监督出现的问题，还要解决它们，这导致了倦怠和问题。经过 6 个月的努力，Rust 发布了新的治理结构：Rust 项目与 Rust 基金会关联，但与之分开，后者主要处理 Rust 的金融资产。新的计划正在征求意见和等待批准。


消息来源：The New Stack



老王点评：说“浴火重生”有点过分，但是很高兴 Rust 项目没有倒下去，而且重新制定了新的治理结构。




“问客”诞生？我觉得这是一个短暂的过渡

鉴于以 ChatGPT、稳定扩散模型等为代表的 AIGC 流行，著名科技人高飞在 Solidot 撰文提出，“这一次伴随 AIGC 而来的新职业，尚未得到广泛的认同和关注。英文称谓也没有统一。”他给这种新职业起了一个新名字，“‘问客’可能是个好名字。”因为，“ChatGPT 等 AIGC 背后的智能本质上是个黑盒子，所以用户-使用者是同等的创新者。所以‘提问’，也就是‘问 AI’才是这些新职业的核心。”


消息来源：Solidot



老王点评：我认为，确实目前 AI 输出的质量和提问的方式有很大关联，这一点我赞同高飞先生的看法。不过，AI 按照这种速度发展，将很快就会明白人们真正想要的东西，而不必细心预设前提、精心构造提问。目前跛脚的 AI 是一个短暂的过渡阶段。




C++ 23 语言标准宣布功能已完备

ISO C++ 委员会宣布已完成了关于 C++ 23 规范的技术工作，并正在制作一份最终文件，以便进行草案审批投票。其主要包括的功能有简化隐式移动，修复 range-for 循环中的暂存器，多维和静态 operator[] 数组，以及 Unicode 改进等等。委员会说，C++ 23 的许多功能已经在主要的编译器和库中实现。同时，计划中的下一个版本 C++ 26 将强调并发性和并行性。

老王点评：最近关于 C++ 的讨论比较多，但是 C++ 还是按部就班地发展着。]]></summary>

弗吉尼亚·伍尔夫在1928年向剑桥大学的年轻女性宣告，有抱负的女作家需要“一间只属于自己的房间”，而对于阿尔芭·德·塞斯佩德斯的《禁忌日记本》的主人公瓦莱里娅来说，她甚至连一个抽屉都没有。
小说设在1950年代初，瓦莱里娅时年四十三岁，与丈夫米歇尔以及两个快长大的孩子（里卡多和米雷拉）住在罗马的某个未曾提到过名字也几乎没被描述过的街区里，共处于一间过于狭小的公寓中（毕竟这不是一本关于地域的小说）。这是一个稳定的中产阶级家庭——米歇尔在银行工作，瓦莱里娅是早年地主的后代，但战争留下的伤痕仍然新鲜，生活需要在艰辛中奋斗。几年来，瓦莱里娅一直在办公室打工来帮补家用，尽管她高傲的母亲反对这么做。家里不再有佣人，脏碗碟再次堆积起来。
我们读到的是瓦莱里娅的日记，从第一页我们就会得知，她是在周日帮丈夫跑腿去烟杂店的时候，一时冲动（“纯属偶然”）买下这本日记本的。这本来是“被禁止的”——因为意大利禁止在周日做生意（卖烟除外），但这个词包含了更多的道德和形而上学的含义。
瓦莱里娅可能想要记日记，这个想法本身就为她的家人带来了不少乐趣。当这个话题还处于假设层面时，她丈夫就这么问：“你想要写什么？到我们这个年纪了还会有什么秘密？”在兴趣驱动下，我们观察瓦莱丽娅把这本神秘的编年史藏进布袋、饼干罐、装着旧滑雪服的箱子里——没完没了、几近滑稽地把它挪来移去，远离窥视。伍尔夫所说的书房对于瓦莱里娅来说，就是天黑后的时间，或者是公寓里难得没有他人的时候，在“浴室里的一张小桌子上，就像我还是个小女孩时那样”。

市面上的古文选本，为数甚夥，其中差异，最是能够体现编选者的眼光与功底。由商伟编注的《给孩子的古文》（插图版），就是近年推出的一部不容忽视的选本，完全可以用精彩纷呈来描述。
一
首先，本书选文精当，编排得法。
作为一部给少年编选的古文读本，理所当然，应将文学史上那些历经淘洗筛选而成为典范的作品，提供给孩子们，从而指示一条进入古文苑囿的门径，一路走去，移步换景，饱览古文历史沿途重要的风景。
但是，如果仅限于那些已经为文学史与中小学古文教育所普遍接受的熟悉篇目，那么，总不免陈陈相因，缺了新鲜感。而事实上，我们阅读本书，会无比欣喜地发现一张张崭新的面孔，这些都是编选者商伟在长久的中国古典文学教研过程中，经目验心证而得以确认的新典范，它们接二连三，迎面走来，与读者一见如故，莫逆于心。而且，其中不少作品，显然打上了编选者个人的鲜明烙印，体现着独特的阅读兴趣与文学品味。这么说，并不意味着本书削弱了典范意识。商伟老师是一位在古典文学研究界训练有素、成绩斐然的学者，他对文学作品有着相当敏锐的鉴别力，对实际生活也保持着充沛的兴趣与热忱。恰恰因为这个缘故，这部选本才富有趣味与灵性，在熟知的典范之中，注入了新鲜的元素。因此，阅读此书，既可重温经典，又时时增长新知。这样的阅读体验，在今天这个知识大爆炸、无效信息充斥人们生活的时代，诚属难能可贵。
本书的篇目编排也可谓匠心独具，机杼自成。通常而言，选本的编纂可难可易。如果只是将单篇文章，按照作者与时代的先后顺序罗列排布，也未尝不可。但显然，编选者取其难者而为之，他重视整体的一贯与内在的关联，拒绝只是将单篇文章孤立地、随机地凑合成书。本书选文有鲜明的特点，将典范性、新鲜感、多样性、趣味性，熔铸一炉。我国古代文章如同星空，众星闪烁，浩瀚无涯。古文的世界中，不仅有道德的教化…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[在处理庞大的数据库时，请尝试这些方便的解决方案，以解决常见的问题。


关系型数据库 PostgreSQL（也被称为 Postgres）已经越来越流行，全球各地的企业和公共部门都在使用它。随着这种广泛的采用，数据库已经变得比以前更大了。在 Crunchy Data，我们经常与 20TB 以上的数据库打交道，而且我们现有的数据库还在继续增长。我的同事 David Christensen 和我收集了一些关于管理拥有巨大表的数据库的技巧。

大表

生产数据库通常由许多具有不同数据、大小和模式的表组成。常见的情况是，最终有一个巨大的、无序的数据库表，远远大于你数据库中的任何其他表。这个表经常存储活动日志或有时间戳的事件，而且对你的应用或用户来说是必要的。

真正的大表会因为很多原因造成挑战，但一个常见的原因是锁。对表的定期维护往往需要锁，但对大表的锁可能会使你的应用瘫痪，或导致堵塞和许多令人头痛的问题。我有一些做基本维护的技巧，比如添加列或索引，同时避免长期运行的锁。

添加索引的问题：在创建索引的过程中锁住表。如果你有一个庞大的表，这可能需要几个小时。

CREATE INDEX ON customers (last_name)


方案：使用 CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY 功能。这种方法将索引创建分成两部分，一部分是短暂的锁定，以创建索引，立即开始跟踪变化，但尽量减少应用阻塞，然后是完全建立该索引，之后查询可以开始使用它。

CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY ON customers (last_name)


添加列

在数据库的使用过程中，添加列是一个常见的请求，但是对于一个巨大的表来说，这可能是很棘手的，同样是由于锁的问题。

问题：当你添加一个新的默认值为一个函数的列时，Postgres 需要重写表。对于大表，这可能需要几个小时。

方案：将操作拆分为多条基本语句，总效果一致，但控制锁的时间。

添加列：

ALTER TABLE all_my_exes ADD COLUMN location text


添加默认值：

ALTER TABLE all_my_exes ALTER COLUMN location SET DEFAULT texas()


使用 UPDATE 来添加默认值：

UPDATE all_my_exes SET location = DEFAULT


添加约束条件

问题: 你想添加一个用于数据验证的检查约束。但是如果你使用直接的方法来添加约束，它将锁定表，同时验证表中的所有现有数据。另外，如果在验证的任何时候出现错误，它将回滚。

ALTER TABLE favorite_bands ADD CONSTRAINT name_check CHECK (name = 'Led Zeppelin')


方案：告诉 Postgres 这个约束，但不要验证它。在第二步中进行验证。这将在第一步中进行短暂的锁定，确保所有新的/修改过的行都符合约束条件，然后在另一步骤中进行验证，以确认所有现有的数据都通过约束条件。

告诉 Postgres 这个约束，但不要强制执行它：

ALTER TABLE favorite_bands ADD CONSTRAINT name_check CHECK (name = 'Led Zeppelin') NOT VALID


然后在创建后验证它：

ALTER TABLE favorite_bands VALIDATE CONSTRAINT name_check


想了解更多？

 Running Linux on the Apple Silicon
  
Linux Virtualization on Apple Silicon
 Asahi Linux Development
 Fedora Linux Development
 NixOS Linux Development
 Debian Linux Development
 Ubuntu Linux Development
  
Most of the hard work, including the kernel and boot software, was done by the Asahi Linux project and their development team.
 While you will end up with a fairly usable computer for the average user, the exact hardware features you want may not be ready yet. Please look at the Asahi Linux Feature Support page for information.
 For more general information about Linux on Apple Silicon Macs, refer to the Asahi Linux project and alpha installer release.
 One last note, The Linux kernel 6.2 offers mainline support for the Apple M1 Pro, Max, and Ultra chips as work done by Asahi Linux's developers was upstreamed. Though, that does not mean you can simply install a Linux distro like Fedora, Ubuntu, or Debian with the 6.2 kernel. You need to use the AsahiLinux Kernel build.

/foo/
/foo/bar/
/foo/bar/more/
That's it. Just three levels and all my controllers get passed in what's between the / with var names first, second, third.
In order to really make sure this framework could build something real I made a Hacker News clone. RemoteRenters.com is a HN just for articles about the remote work revolution since covid. Feel free to vote or submit to see how it all works!

 Ironically, on Windows this pain point is largely gone due to Chocolatey: The system is anyway self-updating, and for end-user software I can just to a choco install and choco upgrade. 
 I was wondering if there is something similar for Linux, i.e. a way to install and update programs from a repository with cutting-edge versions, while keeping the system based on a stable state.
 Ideally, without needing admin rights.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[如何在你的 Bash 终端使用这些秘密代码，请下载我们新的 Linux 元字符速查表。


我最近在读一篇 Don watkins 关于 Shell 元字符的文章。他的文章让我想到了你可以用 shell 输入做的所有的奇怪事情。虽然我可能还没有发现极端的情况，但是我经常发现 shell 转义序列，比如 \b、\t 和 \f 非常有用。

转义序列是一种特殊类型的终端输入。它们旨在让你能够输入物理键盘上没有的字符或触发事件。下面是我最喜欢的 Bash shell 的转义序列。

1、退格符

你可以在命令中输入若干退格符，以便在命令执行时触发。例如这个命令，你可能会认为它的输出是ab，但是看一下真正的输出：

$ echo a$'\b'b
b


从技术上来说，Shell 确实输出了 ab（你可以通过在命令后面附加 | wc -m 来确认这一点），但是全部输出的一部分是 \b 退格事件。退格键在输出 b 字符之前删除了 a 字符，因此输出只有 b 字符。

2、换行符

换行符是一个让你的 Shell 转到下一行的第 0 列的信号。这一点很重要，当使用像 printf 这样的命令时，它不会像 echo 那样在输出的末尾自动添加换行符。看看不带 \n 换行符的 printf 语句和带换行符的 printf 语句之间的区别：

$ printf "%03d.txt" 1
001.txt$
$ printf "%03d.txt\n" 1
001.txt
$


3、换页符

\f 换页信号就像换行符，但是却并不是返回到第 0 列。下面是一个使用换页符而不是换行符的 printf 命令:

$ printf "%s\f" hello
hello
     $


你的 Shell 提示符出现在下一行，但不是在下一行的行首。

4、制表符

有两种制表符转义序列：水平制表符 \t 和垂直制表符 \v。水平制表符如下所示：

$ echo a$'\t'b
a     b


理论上，垂直制表符是相同的原理，但是在垂直空间中。然而，在大多数控制台上，一行的垂直间距是不可变的，所以它通常看起来很像一个换页符：

$ echo a$'\v'b
a
 b


5、Unicode

Unicode 标准中有很多可用的字符，而你的键盘只有大约 100 个键。在 Linux 上有几种方法可以输入 特殊字符，但是将它们输入到终端的一种方法是使用 Unicode 转义序列。这个转义序列以 \u 开头，后跟一个十六进制值。你可以在文件 /usr/share/X11/locale/en_US.UTF-8/Compose 中找到许多 Unicode 值。你也可以在 https://www.Unicode.org/charts/ 查看 Unicode 规范。

这对于输入像圆周率 π（圆的周长与直径之比）等常见符号非常有用：

$ echo $'\u03C0'
π


还有许多其他的符号和字符：

$ echo $'\u270B'
✋
$ echo $'\u2658'
♘
$ echo $'\u2B67'
⭧


有盲文符号、音乐符号、字母、电气符号、数学符号、表情符号、游戏符号等等。事实上，有如此多的可用符号，有时你需要 \U（注意大写字母）Unicode 转义序列来访问高区的 Unicode。例如，这张红心 5 的扑克牌只出现在 \U 转义序列中:

$ echo $'\U1F0B5'
🂵


浏览一下 Unicode 规范，找到适合你的位置，并使用 \u 和 \U 来访问你需要的所有特殊符号。

除此之外

Bash Shell 的手册页中列出了 18 个转义序列，我发现其中一些更有用。我已经在本文中介绍了我最爱的几个，Don Watkins 也谈到了他在文章中最常用的元字符，但是还有更多待发现。有很多方法可以对字母和数字、子 Shell、数学方程等进行编码。为了更好地了解 Shell 可用的元字符，可以下载我们的 元字符速查表，你可以在使用计算机上最强大的应用程序 —— Linux 终端时将它放在手边。

相较于知名农业专家、食品工程博士与上海交通大学MBA课程教授这些身份，崔凯先生更乐意以“农家子弟”与“（半个）文艺青年”自居。这使他的新作《谷物的故事》在具备恢弘的文明史、全球史视野的同时，有了更接地气的人间关怀和更加生动的言说方式。一方面，他“能够跳出书本”，用“产业、经济和社会的视角”切入看似微末而易遭忽视的小小谷物，从中发现人类社会的大问题；另一方面，他举重若轻，要言不烦，尽量少说“黑话”、多说“人话”，对各种现实问题做了深入、清晰的梳理与分析。近期《上海书评》请崔凯聊了聊关于谷物的那些事。

《谷物的故事》，崔凯著，上海三联书店2022年9月出版，336页，49.00元

能请您谈谈写作《谷物的故事》的缘起吗？
崔凯：首先，我和谷物有着与生俱来的缘分。1970年，我出生在吉林省吉林市一个叫孤店子公社的地方，当时家里就是一间茅草房，一直住到上高三。房前屋后就是连绵几十里的农田。放学以后作业很少，一群孩子就在田野里疯玩，捞河鱼、掏鸟窝、抓田鼠。也干过一些坏事，到了秋天，我们一群熊孩子会从放学路上经过的豆田里拔出几株成熟的豆株，坐在地头，用火柴把秸秆点燃，随着“噼噼啪啪”的响声，很快就能闻到黄豆烤焦的香气。等秸秆烧完了，大家七手八脚把火踩灭，在草灰中拾拣烤熟的豆粒，吃得嘴巴和手指沾满黑色的炭灰。

崔凯回到故乡的村庄

当然，并不是所有的记忆都是美好的。遇到春旱年景，机井灌溉抽水，地下水位下降，村里的井水枯了，我要到几里外的一眼深井去挑水，挺累的。村民们也经常会为抢水灌溉发生械斗，致伤致残死。遇到病虫害，农田里植株一片一片的枯黄，会减产甚至绝收。这些经历是一种与生俱来的“田野调查”。或者说，从出生开始，谷物就是我生活的一部分。
其次，就受到我相对比较特殊的个人求学和工作经历的影响了。很多人关于…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[开源多媒体框架 FFmpeg 6.0 现已发布，带来了更新和改进。


流行的开源多媒体框架 FFmpeg 6.0 现已发布。这个主要的版本现在已可下载，并在多媒体项目中使用。其亮点变化包括两个新的图像格式支持，许多编解码器和其他增强功能。

下面是一个快速回顾。

FFmpeg 6.0 新增内容

主要变化

这个版本的主要亮点是对两种新图像格式的支持。Radiance HDR 图像（RGBE）为用户在图像处理中提供了更好的色彩深度和动态范围。FFmpeg 6.0 现在包括对 WBMP（无线应用协议位图） 图像格式的支持，这在移动设备和网络应用中是常用的图像格式。

在 FFmpeg 6.0 中，新的 -shortest_buf_duration 选项允许用户为音频和视频缓冲区设置一个最小的持续时间，这可以确保在输出文件中使用最短的缓冲区时间。

从 FFmpeg 6.0 开始，线程必须被内置到软件中才能运行。在这个版本中，每个复用器都在一个单独的线程中运行。这提高了性能，使同时处理多个流的效率更高。

FFmpeg 6.0 中的 cropdetect（裁剪检测）过滤器现在包括一个新的模式，可以根据运动向量和边缘检测裁剪区域，为用户提供更精确的视频裁剪控制。

过滤器

在这个版本中，大量的过滤器得到了更新，这将通过新的功能简化你的多媒体项目和工作流程。下面是一个快速的变化列表：


ddagrab 过滤器现在支持桌面复制视频捕获，允许用户直接从他们的桌面上捕获视频。

a3dscope 过滤器为用户提供了音频信号的 3D 范围显示，允许更精确的音频编辑和处理。

backgroundkey 过滤器允许用户删除或替换视频片段中的背景，为视频编辑提供更大的灵活性。

showcwt 多媒体过滤器允许用户将连续小波变换系数可视化，提供对信号和图…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Before adopting Linux full time some 6-7 years ago, I used Mac. I got used to the Mac app launchpad, and when moving to Linux I found that GNOME offered the closest aesthetic. That said, GNOME is very heavy and I would like something lighter. I would like the option of having a full screen app launcher which is installable separate from the DE itself, so even if I install something lighter like XFCE I could still get my preferred style of app menu. I'm a very visual person and I like to see my apps displayed graphically rather than listed vertically in a windows-style start menu. Most of the results I get when I search are for generic app launchers like Albert and ULauncher, which are not what I'm after at all.

TypeScript 团队已经推出了 5.0 RC，完整版本计划于 3 月 14 日发布。它最大的新功能是 ECMAScript 装饰器，这个功能可以通过名为装饰器表达式的注解来扩展类，允许以可重复使用的方式定制类及其成员。但装饰器目前不是 ECMAScript 2023 年草案的一部分。这意味着 TypeScript 的开发者将比 ECMAScript 规范更早获得这一功能。此外，TypeScript 5.0 编译器比以前快了约 10%。

老王点评：我觉得 TypeScript 更好、更严谨。




GNOME Shell 和 Mutter 合成器已经脱离了 GTK3

GNOME Shell 现在将只依赖于 GNOME-Desktop-4 / GTK4，X11 显示代码已经脱离了 GTK3，并且 GTK3 也不再作为 Mutter 库/执行程序的依赖关系。GNOME-Shell 对 GTK3 的强制依赖已被放弃，而现在只有一个对 GTK4 运行环境的软链接。当然，仍然有一些依赖 GTK3 的应用，比如 GIMP 现在还在努力往 GTK3 上迁移，甚至还有一些依赖 GTK2 的应用。

老王点评：很高兴能看到 GNOME 44 发布时摆脱了 GTK3。




欧洲推动设立月球时区

这个想法是去年年底在荷兰举行的一次会议上提出的，世界各地的航天组织同意迫切需要建立 “共同的月球参考时间”。目前，月球任务是按照操作航天器的国家的时间运行，一个国际公认的月球时区将使大家都方便。目前正在辩论是否应该由一个单一的组织来设定和维持月球上的时间。每个月球日的时间长达 29.5 个地球日，而且每天增加约 56 微秒。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[胡适·海菲兹·鲁宾斯坦
读胡适日记，往往会有意想不到的收获。1931年11月13日胡适日记云：
与在君同赴General Crozier的晚餐，饭后同听Heifetz的提琴独奏。此君在今日可算是最伟大的提琴家，我今天第一次听他奏琴，虽不懂此道，也极倾倒。

1931年11月13日胡适日记

这段日记中，内地版的《胡适日记全编》第六卷漏了“第一次”三个字，据日记手稿补全。在君即丁文江，地质学家，胡适好友。Crozier是美国退伍将军，当时住在北京，胡适日记中数次出现。据当时也在场观赏演出的作曲家刘天华的弟子陈振铎追述，海菲兹这场独奏音乐会是在北京饭店举行的。那么，应该是胡、丁和Crozier先在北京饭店宴聚，接下来就一同聆赏海菲兹这次访华也是唯一一次访华的首次演出，这是当晚的重头戏。胡适这则日记旁还粘贴了一张题为“著名的小提琴家”的海菲兹的照片，又附有一页这场独奏音乐会的英文节目单，译成中文照录如下：
上半场：恰空舞曲  维塔利（1644-1692）；西班牙交响曲  拉罗。
下半场：G弦上的咏叹调  巴赫；回旋曲  舒伯特；亚麻色头发的少女  德彪西-哈特曼；霍拉舞曲  迪尼库-海菲兹；霍塔舞曲  法雅。
这场曲：茨冈  拉威尔。
钢琴伴奏：Isidor Achron
海菲兹这场小提琴独奏会的曲目与翌日他在天津的演出曲目比较，只多了一首《霍拉舞曲》，显然是经过了精心设计，从巴洛克时期一直到印象派音乐，所在多有，颇为丰富，又以法国和西班牙作曲家的作品为主，除了《西班牙交响曲》原是小提琴协奏曲（改编为小提琴独奏），其他都是悠扬典雅或活泼可爱的小品名曲。不过，这对并不熟悉西方古典音乐的中国听众来讲，恐仍是一个挑战。胡适1930年1月30日在日记中坦陈对“欧美的音乐戏剧，我竟毫不知道，惭愧得很”。他“第一次”听海菲兹，又记“不懂此道”，这是可以理解的大实话。但他毕竟是文史大家，“也极…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[在终端基础系列的 上一章 中，你学到了在 Linux 命令行中改变文件夹的知识。

我在最后给出了一个练习，简单地提到了创建目录。

在本系列的这一部分，我将讨论如何使用 mkdir 命令在 Linux 命令行中建立新的文件夹。

mkdir dir_name


mkdir 是 “创建目录make directories” 的简称。让我们来看看这个命令的使用情况。


📋 如果你不知道，文件夹在 Linux 中被称为目录。


在 Linux 中创建一个新目录

你现在应该已经熟悉了 Linux 中绝对路径和相对路径的概念。如果没有，请参考 本教程。

如果你的系统还没有打开终端，请打开它。通常情况下，你从主目录（/home/username）开始。但为了本教程和回忆一些事情，我假定你不在你的主目录中。

所以，先换到你的主目录：

cd


是的，如果你简单地输入 cd，没有任何选项和参数，它就会把你带到你的主目录。你也可以使用 cd ~ 等方法。

在这里，建立一个新的目录，叫做 practice。

mkdir practice


你能切换到这个新建立的 practice 目录吗？

cd practice


很好！现在你有了一个专门的文件夹，你将在这里练习本系列中的 Linux 命令行教程。



创建多个新目录

你刚刚创建了一个新的目录。如果你要创建不止一个呢？比方说，有三个。

你可以对每个目录连续使用三次 mkdir 命令。这将会起作用。然而，这并不是真的需要。你可以像这样同时创建多个目录来节省时间和精力：

mkdir dir1 dir2 dir3


请继续这样做吧。你可以列出 practice 目录的内容，查看所有新创建的目录。以后会有更多关于 ls 命令的内容。




💡 你不能在同一地方有两个同名的文件夹或文件。


创建多个嵌套的子目录

你现在知道了一次创建多个目录的方法。

但是，如果你要创建一个嵌套的目录结构呢？比方说，你需要在 dir1 里面的 subdir1 里面创建一个目录 subdir2。

dir1/subdir1/subdir2


这里的问题是 subdir1 并不存在。所以如果你尝试 mkdir dir1/subdir1/subdir32，你会得到一个错误：

abhishek@itsfoss:~/practice$ mkdir dir1/subdir1/subdir2
mkdir: cannot create directory ‘dir1/subdir1/subdir2’: No such file or directory


如果你不知道的话，你会选择 mkdir dir1/subdir1，然后运行 mkdir dir1/subdir2。这将会起作用。然而，有一个更好的方法。

你使用 -p 选项，它会在需要时创建父目录。如果你运行下面的命令：

mkdir -p dir1/subdir1/subdir2


它将创建 subdir1，然后在 subdir1 里面创建 subdir2。


💡 不是命名惯例，但最好在文件和目录名中避免空格。使用下划线或破折号代替，因为处理文件/目录名中的空格需要额外精力。


测试你的知识

这是一个相当简短的教程，因为 mkdir 命令只有几个选项。

现在，让我给你一些实践练习，以利用你先前创建的 practice 目录。


不进入 dir2 目录，在其中创建两个新的子目录。

不进入 dir3 目录，创建两级嵌套子目录（subdir1/subdir2）

进入 dir2 目录。在这里，在你的主目录下创建一个名为 temp_stuff 的目录。不要担心，我们将在本系列教程的后面删除它。

回到父目录 practice，尝试创建一个名为 dir3 的目录。你看到一个错误。你能用 -p 选项使它消失吗？


你可以 在社区论坛讨论这个练习。

在终端基础系列的下一章中，你将学习如何用 ls 命令列出一个目录的内容。

如果你有问题或建议，请告诉我。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[这是一个困扰 Linux 用户的常见问题。这也是考试和面试中经常问到的一个问题。下面是你需要了解的所有内容。


你可能在网络上的各种论坛以及讨论区听过这句话：


Linux 只是一个内核。


这让你感到好奇。它是个内核？还是个操作系统？两者之间有什么区别？

我将在本文中回答这些问题。

Linux 是操作系统还是内核？

好吧，从技术上讲，Linux 只是一个内核，而不是一个操作系统。但是，术语 “Linux” 通常是指一个完整的操作系统，它包括一个 交互界面Shell（例如：bash）和命令行和/或 GUI 工具来控制系统。这个完整的操作系统的正确叫法是 “Linux 发行版”。流行的 Linux 发行版有 Ubuntu、Red Hat 和 Debian。

早在 1991 年，Linus Torvalds 创建的只是一个内核。直到今天，他也在为 Linux 内核工作。他不再编写代码，而是监督哪些代码进入内核。

内核？什么东西？

内核是每个操作系统的中心。不仅仅是 Linux，Windows 和 macOS 也有内核。

将内核想象成操作系统的心脏。没有心脏，你就无法生存。没有内核，操作系统就无法存在。

但是，就像心脏需要一个身体来生存一样，内核需要其他人们可以在计算机上使用的程序和工具来构成一个完整的操作系统。

这是一个操作系统的典型架构：



在中心的内核与硬件交互。在它之上是与内核交互的 交互界面Shell。然后你有应用程序、命令行和图形界面，为你提供使用系统的各种方式。

内核是引擎，操作系统是汽车

一个更好的类比是将内核想象成汽车的引擎，而操作系统则是汽车。

你不可能驾驶一个引擎，但是如果没有引擎，你也不能驾驶一辆汽车。你需要轮胎、转向机和其他组件才能将其变成一辆可以驾驶的汽车。

相似地，你不能直接使用内核。你需要 交互界面Shell，其他工具和组件才能使用操作系统。



Linux 对比 GNU/Linux

在类似的地方，你也会看到例如 “Linux 只是一个内核，你所说的 Linux 实际上是 GNU/Linux” 的陈述。

在 Linus Torvalds 在 1991 年创建 Linux 之前，Richard Stallman 就创建了自由软件运动Free Software movement和 GNU 项目。GNU 项目包括对流行的 UNIX 工具和命令的重新实现，例如 ls、grep、sed 等。

通常，你的 Linux 发行版会在 Linux 内核之上包含所有这些 GNU 工具。

这就是为什么纯粹主义者坚持称之为 GNU/Linux，以便人们不要忘记 GNU 对 Linux 成功的贡献和重要性。

最后……

所以，如果你在面试或者考试中被问到这个问题，回答 “Linux 是一个内核，而不是一个操作系统”。这是你的老师或面试官在大多数情况下想要的答案。

但是更深入一点，理解内核和操作系统之间的区别。

如果有人说：“我使用 Linux”，你就会明白这个人是指 Linux 发行版，而不仅仅是内核。诚然，没有必要用 “Linux 只是一个内核，而不是一个操作系统” 来纠正别人。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The thing which suffered the most in my opinion is its design. Dash no longer looks glorious, it's flat because that's "modern cool flat look" (basically just for the sake of being flat i think), flat desing can be good, but it's poorly implemented. The wallpapers that they ship is nowhere near the official ubuntu wallpapers, same goes to their theme and icons.Also I think that Ambiance theme looked much better on Unity than Yaru theme: improving Ambiance would be a much better move than moving to Yaru IMO.
 I'd love to go back to Unity desktop, I like its way of doing things so well. But because of the way it is kept now I can't really do that. Don't get me wrong, I respect the their efforts: the fact that there is a person who decided to bring it back to life is very cool. That being said, it's still not so polished in terms of bugs and usability (last time I tried was 22.04).
 I think making it more usable and fixing bugs (and maybe porting it to other distros) is a much higher priority than new features. I miss Unity, yet I hope that some day in the future it will become what it needs to be. It's truly incredible that some 13y.o kid has gone this far.
 What do you guys think? Is it possible? Is my critique valid?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[On March 7, 2003, a struggling company called The SCO Group filed a lawsuit against IBM, claiming that the
success of Linux was the result of a theft of SCO's technology.  Two
decades later, it is easy to look back on that incident as a somewhat
humorous side-story in the development of Linux.  At the time, though, it
shook our community to its foundations.  It is hard to overestimate how
much the community we find ourselves in now was shaped by a ridiculous
lawsuit 20 years ago.]]></summary>

that we are not done with year-2038 problems yet.


	The general statement so far has always been that on 64bit systems
	with a 64bit time_t you are safe with respect to the Y2038
	problem. But glibc uses for compatibility with 32bit userland
	applications 32bit time_t in some places even on 64bit systems.


One of those places is the utmp file.
The post includes a proposal for solving the problem by getting rid of
utmp entirely.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This is a very rare and sinister problem. So please don't remove this. I also have posted the same thing in windows10 subreddit but they'll probably not post it. As usual they'll never accept their wrongdoing. This could help someone.
 I mostly use linux. I game on linux. It works well for me. So I installed a new CPU lately, I even did hours of intense gaming with it. Like Doom Eternal etc. It never gave the slightest problem. It was working fine for days.
 Then for some reason I needed windows, so I plugged in my windows SSD. God damn it gave BSOD all the time. Blue screen as we all know of. I thought the CPU was faulty at first. But how so? It worked perfectly on linux for days? I was just downloading games from steam, 5 minute passes, BAM! It gives BSOD. What? I have never seen such a thing happen at all, in my 30 years of computing. Then I thought maybe the TPM thing is responsible for this. I researched about it. Because on BIOS it asks me "new cpu installed wanna reset fTPM blah blah" so I went ahead and disabled the TPM. It gives no BSOD at all right now. Even I played Doom Eternal for 2 hours on Windows just to test it. No BSOD.
 How could it be that way though? I never touched the BIOS while on linux either way. Does linux ever BSOD?
 Seriously what a fucking shit. Linux devs please don't enable this TPM thing in the future.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[《穿过针眼：财富、西罗马帝国的衰亡和基督教会的形成，350-550年》，[美]彼得·布朗著，刘寅、包倩怡等译，社会科学文献出版社2021年7月出版，1156页，198.00元

“我实在告诉你们：财主进天国是难的。我又告诉你们，骆驼穿过针的眼，比财主进神的国还容易呢！”
——《马太福音》19:23（和合本）
2021年5月至6月初，在为期五周的时间内，美国莱斯大学（Rice University）大学主办了一系列学术讲座，主题为“Foucault's Confessions”，以纪念并讨论2018年在巴黎出版的已故知名法国思想家米歇尔·福柯遗作《性史》第四卷《肉体的招供》（Les aveux de la chair, éd. F. Gros, Paris, Gallimard, 2018）。2021年5月6日，主办方邀请历史学家彼得·布朗作为讲座嘉宾（以下简称“讲座2021”）。《肉体的招供》主要聚焦于教父作家，除了与巴黎的学者与科研机构讨论外，作为非该领域专家的福柯借着在美国讲学的机会，与当时正在研究该问题的布朗进行了简单会面。布朗回忆到，那是1980年10月21日，作为一名中青年学者的他与当时全球闻名的大思想家福柯在伯克利碰了头。那个年代资讯不如现在发达，只有通过做讲座的形式才能方便地结识学者与推广自己的研究。在讲座后，福柯竟然像小孩子一样问布朗对他有关约翰·格西安（Jean Cassien）的研究有何看法，年轻的布朗受宠若惊（讲座2021）。

时光荏苒，如今的布朗已至耄耋。那次讲座或许是近年来这位西方古代晚期领域的知名研究专家为数不多的一次露面。近日，法国古典接受史期刊Anabases最新一期上发表了一篇对彼得·布朗的采访文章，题为《彼得·布朗与制造古代晚期》（Peter Brown and the Making of Lat…]]></summary>

        <id>https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35004184</id>
        <link href="https://github.com/praetorian-inc/noseyparker"/>
        <updated>2023-03-03T00:40:18.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Nosey Parker is an Apache-licensed command-line tool that finds secrets and sensitive information in textual data. It's useful both for offensive and defensive security testing.
The big idea: textual content in, hardcoded secrets out. These include things like API keys and passwords.
It should do a reasonable job on any textual input. It will recursively scan any directories it is pointed at. It also has special support for scanning the complete contents of Git repositories.
The default rules in Nosey Parker have been carefully chosen to minimize false positives. Many API tokens these days have well-specified formats that are amenable to precise matching with regular expressions, and these are the kind of things that the default rules detect. Additionally, its findings are deduplicated. Together, these give much higher signal-to-noise compared to similar tools.
Nosey Parker is fast: it can scan 100GB of Linux kernel commit history in just over a minute on my laptop. This speed comes from several factors, but most significantly from using the amazing Hyperscan library for simultaneous matching of all regex rules in a single pass. In comparison with similar tools on large inputs, Nosey Parker is usually 1-3 orders of magnitude faster.
Nosey Parker was originally created to help construct a labeled dataset of secrets for machine learning purposes. But it proved surprisingly useful on its own. In the past year, an internal, proprietary version (with added machine learning capabilities) has been regularly used in security engagements at Praetorian.
In late 2022, Nosey Parker was reimplemented in Rust, released as open-source, and presented at Black Hat Arsenal.
It now supports enumeration and scanning of GitHub repositories by providing just usernames or organization names. It also recently got support for SARIF output, which several other tools understand.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[专利局称人工智能不比你的猫更适合作为发明人

有人对他的专利申请被拒绝提出质疑，他将其人工智能机器 DABUS 命名为某种饮料容器和闪光灯的发明人。此前，他试图在几个国家注册以人工智能为发明人的专利，但只在澳大利亚和南非获得成功。英国专利局称，如果法官作出有利于人工智能的裁决，允许人工智能机器被命名为发明人，发明人可能包括 “我的猫 Felix” 或 “宇宙力量” 等 “明显荒谬的主张”。英国最高法院将对此进行裁决，决定人工智能机器是否可以被命名为发明人以及谁可以拥有专利。

老王点评：猫真的没法发明什么。




苹果阻止更新由 ChatGPT 驱动的应用程序

由于担心电子邮件应用程序 BlueMail 的一项新的人工智能功能会显示不恰当的内容，苹果上周采取措施阻止了 BlueMail 的更新。BlueMail 的新人工智能功能使用 OpenAI 最新的 ChatGPT 聊天机器人，利用以前的电子邮件和日历事件的内容帮助自动撰写电子邮件。苹果驳回称，“你的应用程序包括人工智能生成的内容，但目前似乎不包括内容过滤”，要求 BlueMail 将其年龄限制提高到 17 岁以上，或包括内容过滤功能。该应用程序的限制目前设定为 4 岁及以上的用户。苹果对 17 岁及以上的年龄限制是针对那些可能包括从冒犯性语言到性内容和提及毒品的应用程序类别。


消息来源：华尔街日报



老王点评：AI 的发展太快，一系列的规则和法律都需要与之适应。但如果互联网在发展之初也带这么多条条框框，可能也发展不起来。




英特尔发布量子计算开发工具包

在去年发布测试版后，英特尔发布了量子计算开发工具包 Quantum SDK 1.0，以帮助发展量子计算的开发者生态系统。它可以帮助开发者在英特尔 Horse Ridge II 控制芯片和量子自旋量子比特芯片硬件上市之前，在模拟环境中开发量子算法。它的后端是英特尔量子模拟器（IQS），它能够在单个节点上实现 32 个量子比特，或在多个节点上实现 40 个量子比特。


消息来源：Phoronix



老王点评：可能相比人工智能能看到的发展，人们对量子计算没有那么直接的感受，但是一旦突破，带来的颠覆性影响更大。]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Not sure who this will help and not sure if others have as smooth of a brain as mine but this happened...
 I've had an ongoing issue with my HP ProBook 450 G8 not being able to use wifi for the past year or so. Only way I could use wifi is if I re-installed windows (Yes, secureboot was turned off). All the hardware showed up, it just wouldn't connect regardless of how many times I prayed to the big systemctl in the sky.
 The issue being the kernel not finding the appropriate drivers (iwlwifi-QuZ-a0-jf-b0-64.ucode through iwlwifi-QuZ-a0-jf-b0-72.ucode). I did everything and tried everything, read and re-read the same posts, installed different distros, rolled back the kernel, installed drivers from sus sites (Probably got free malware too) ran every mainstream distro, tinkered with various bios settings, each time only to be met with utter despair.
 There was, however, one setting in bios I never touched and that was the lock wireless setting. I always disregarded it, "Why would I want to lock wireless?" thought my inner caveman. I decided to turn it on this time. Threw in my manjaro usb and I could finally connect to WiFi. In utter disbelief I thought it was just a fluke and that Manjaro was the silver bullet (It's pretty much arch, btw) I then ran through all the other distros in my ever growing drawer of iso's, each and everyone worked. I probably spent 20-30 hours troubleshooting this over the past year, all because I ignored the lock wireless bios setting.
 TL/DR: If your HP ProBook 450 G8 can't connect to wifi, turn on the lock wireless button.
 Sincerely,
 A humbled Linux user

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Artipie 是一个开源的自托管的仓库管理器，它不仅可以用于 Python。


在学生时代使用 Python 开发时，我发现我需要一些私人的集中存储。这样我就可以存储二进制和文本数据文件，以及 Python 软件包。我在 Artipie 中找到了答案，这是一个开源的自托管的软件仓库管理器。

在大学里，我和我的同事们对来自实验测量的大量数据进行研究。我使用 Python 来处理和可视化它们。当时我的大学同事是数学家，没有软件开发技术的经验。他们通常只是在闪存盘上或通过电子邮件传递数据和代码。我努力向他们介绍像 Git 这样的版本管理系统，但没有成功。

Python 仓库

Artipie 支持 PyPI 仓库，与 twine 和 pip 兼容。这意味着你可以完全像在 PyPI 和 TestPyPI 仓库上安装或发布软件包那样使用 Artipie Python 仓库。

要创建你自己的 Python 仓库，你可以使用名为 Artipie Central 的 Artipie 托管实例。当你登录后，你会看到一个列出你的仓库的页面（开始时是空的），以及一个添加新仓库的表单。为你的新仓库选择一个名字（例如，mypython），选择 Python 作为仓库类型，然后点击 “添加Add” 按钮。

接下来，你会看到一个以 YAML 格式显示仓库设置的页面：

---
repo:
  type: pypi
  storage: default
  permissions:
    olenagerasimova:
      - upload
    "*":
      - download


配置中的 type 映射设置了仓库的类型。在这个例子中，Python 仓库被配置为默认的 Artipie Central 存储。

still remains true that there is little that can be done in Rust beyond the
creation of a "hello world" module.  That functionality was already
available in C, of course, with a level of safety similar to what Rust can
provide.  Interest is growing, though, in merging actually useful modules
written in Rust; that will require some more capable infrastructure than is
currently present.  A recent discussion on the handling of time values in
Rust demonstrates the challenges — and opportunities — inherent in this

ChatGPT（Chat Generative Pre-trained Transformer），美国OpenAI研发的人工智能聊天机器人程序，于2022年11月30日发布。ChatGPT使用基于GPT-3.5架构的大型语言模型并通过强化学习进行训练。ChatGPT目前仍以文字方式交互，而除了可以通过人类自然对话方式进行交互，还可以用于相对复杂的语言工作，包括自动文本生成、自动问答、自动摘要等在内的多种任务。如：在自动文本生成方面，ChatGPT可以根据输入的文本自动生成类似的文本（剧本、歌曲、企划等），在自动问答方面，ChatGPT可以根据输入的问题自动生成答案。还具有编写和调试计算机程序的能力。


ChatGPT可以写出相似于真人程度的文章，并因其在许多知识领域给出详细的回答和清晰的答案而迅速获得关注，证明了从前认为不会被AI取代的知识型工作它也足以胜任。ChatGPT于2022年11月发布后，OpenAI估值已涨至290亿美元。上线两个月后，用户数量达到1亿。]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[OpenAI 低价倾销 ChatGPT API

OpenAI 向开发者释放了它的 ChatGPT 和 Whisper 模型，他们现在可以通过 API 调用将这个聊天机器人互动和语音到文本转换整合到自己的应用程序中。新的 ChatGPT API 将使用与 ChatGPT 相同的人工智能模型，其 API 的价格为每 1000 个字元（约 750 个单词）0.2 美分。OpenAI 称这比以前的 GPT 模型便宜 10 倍。Whisper 是去年 9 月发布的一个自动语音识别系统，它能够将英语口语转化为文本。Whisper 的价格为 0.6 美分/分钟。


消息来源：The Register



老王点评：这可以起诉 OpenAI 反竞争了。别的 AI 厂商能力打不打，价格也打不过，要怎么办。




Fedora 38 仍将支持帧缓存 X11 和 NIS+

Fedora 38 原计划准备放弃对一些老旧技术的支持，但由于无法在发布前完成，而被推迟到以后的版本。比如，在 PAM 和用户空间中对 NIS+ 的支持将被保留，它是 Unix 的一个网络目录服务，现在基本上被 LDAP 取代。还有，虽然 X.org 还没有消失，但原计划在 Fedora 36/37 中删除老式驱动程序，如 VESA 和 fbdev 驱动程序。这很重要，因为删除旧的帧缓冲控制台和它的驱动是与合并实时内核的补丁联系在一起的。但现在，它们还存在。


消息来源：Phoronix



老王点评：即便是旧的驱动，想干干净净的打扫了，也没法一删了之。




近 40% 的软件工程师只愿意远程工作

根据 Hired 的《2023 年软件工程师状况》，近 40% 的软件工程师只喜欢远程角色，如果他们的雇主强制要求回到办公室，21% 的人表示他们会立即辞职，而另外 49% 的人表示他们会开始寻找另一份工作。这份报告从 68,500 名软件工程候选人以及对 1300 多名软件工程师和 120 名人才专业人士的调查中收集了数据。


消息来源：Tech Target



老王点评：真是回不去过去了。除了众所周知的原因外，还有一个原因是现在的基础设施也基本上满足了远程工作需求。]]></summary>

毕竟，作为一个年轻人，如果连 QQ 都不能在 Linux 上使用，不亚于断网造成的困扰。你可能可以用 Linux 来写完工作的文档，但你无法将其传递给你的同事们；你可能需要使用 FTP 将其上传到自己的网站上，再给同事链接，让同事去下载，抑或是使用海外的 Skype、Slack 等产品。虽然你连接着互联网，但你仿佛就是断网。

但那个时候，腾讯尚未为 Linux 提供 QQ 应用。虽然有人通过其它的一些变通方式可以勉强在 Linux 上使用 QQ，但效果差强人意。直到 2009 年，腾讯才正式推出了 QQ 1.0 版本。随后的十年里，Linux 上的 QQ 就再无动静，一直到 2019 年，QQ 才 再次更新 了 2.0 版本。



但这个新的 2.0 版本，其应用界面却还停留在 10 年前。而随后，QQ for Linux 并为见到持续的更新。虽然缓解了部分 Linux 用户使用 QQ 的难处，但几年来，并未引来更多反响和改进。

直到最近，QQ for Linux 又有了 新的动作，先后推出了 3.0、3.1，并且比之前的版本有了突破性的改变，真正让 QQ For Linux ，成为一个可用的选项。

在已经知道要处理什么文件和对文件进行哪些操作的情况下，编写处理文件的 C 语言程序就很容易了。如果将文件名“硬编码”在程序中，或者你的程序只以一种方式来处理文件，那么你的程序总是知道要做什么。

但是如果程序每次运行时能够对用户的输入做出反应，可以使程序更灵活。让用户告诉程序要处理什么文件，或者以不同的方式完成任务，要实现这样的功能就需要读取命令行参数。

读取命令行

一个 C 语言程序可以用如下声明开头：

int main()


这是启动 C 程序最简单的形式。但如果在圆括号中加入标准参数，你的程序就可以从命令行中读取选项了：

int main(int argc, char **argv)


argc 表示命令行中的参数个数。它总是一个至少为 1 的数。

argv 是一个二级指针，它指向一个字符串数组。这个数组中保存的是从命令行接收的各个参数。数组的第一个元素 *argv[0] 是程序的名称。**argv 数组的其它元素包含剩下的命令行参数。

下面我将写一个简单的示例程序，它能够回显通过命令行参数传递给它的选项。它跟 Linux 的 echo 命令类似，只不过我们的程序会打印出程序名。同时它还会调用 puts 函数将命令行选项按行打印输出。

#include <stdio.h>

int
main(int argc, char **argv)
{
  int i;

  printf("argc=%d\n", argc); /* debugging */

  for (i = 0; i < argc; i++) {
    puts(argv);
  }

  return 0;
}


编译此程序，并在运行时提供一些命令行参数…]]></summary>

我认识周良霄先生在1984年4月，他和杨讷先生一起到上海，向辞书出版社交完成的《中国历史大辞典》（下简称《大辞典》）的《辽夏金元史》稿子。
周良霄是湖南新邵人，生于1931年的12月12日。五年后的这天，发生了震惊中外的“西安事变”（即“双十二事变”）。所以有时他会自嘲云，来到世上五年之后，即发生了不太平。他和另一位蒙元史专家周清澍是小同乡，两人同乡又同姓，五百年前是一家。更巧的是两人前后受教于北京大学历史系，而且又同在蒙元史领域取得了突出的成就，因而被学界称为“元史二周”。
然而两人的经历与风格毕竟是不一样的。周良霄有“名士”之风，不拘小节，直来直去。他和杨讷为《大辞典》效力而多次来沪，两人格调迥异。杨讷从生活到学术，处处显示精明强干，巨细无遗。比起他来，周良霄只能是“吕端大事不糊涂”，他在生活上只求过得去便足矣。两人在一起却很合得来，双方都知晓对方的长处与短处，正好优势互补。所以碰到两人一起出差，周良霄夫人顾菊英女士总会叮嘱他：“杨讷买什么，你买什么。”这倒好，方便了周良霄依样画葫芦。只有一次，说是杨讷买了一个炒菜的铁锅，因为北京没货，这下周良霄犯愁了，不知道该不该仿效，也买一个带回去？
周良霄不善家政，家中的大小开支当然全由顾菊英做主。从五十年代到改革开放初的八十年代，中国知识分子的生活还是很清苦的。那时他们有三个未成年的子女，难得有些稿费，都是久旱之望云霓的“及时雨”。周良霄总说：“这种事情，老婆是最精明了。”他和杨讷都是《大辞典》的《辽夏金元史》的副主编，还有陈高华、陈得芝等几位。有一次两人出席《大辞典》的分卷主编会议，周良霄先到，当场填写本卷主编、副主编的名序，他填了几位就记不全了，偏偏把杨讷的名字漏了，还好，杨讷到后自己补上了。杨讷很奇怪：“你怎么连这个都记不全？”有什么办法，他就是记不全这类事情。1985年《辽夏金元史》排出校样后，他和杨讷到上…]]></summary>

近日读葛兆光教授课程系列讲义之《亚洲史的研究方法：以近世东部亚洲海域为中心》（商务印书馆， 2022年10月），真有一种畅快、充实、如入宝山之感。作者在书中介绍日本学者石田干之助写于1943年的课程讲义《南海に关すゐ支那史料》的时候说：“石田干之助的这部书，其实是非常好的有关南海之学的入门门径。在这部书中，中国有关南海的主要文献，有了基本的和清晰的介绍，东洋和西洋的相关研究，也有了不错的提示，让我们不仅对南海之学有了初步文献知识，对于南海研究的东西方学术史，也有了初步的了解。我总是很感叹这种上课的方式，石田这样教书，真是金针度人的好老师。”（187页）读葛兆光课程讲义系列的感受也正是如此，但更应该说这些讲义并非仅是入门门径，所提供给学生的也并非仅是基础知识读本，而同时也是有问题意识、学术深度以及更重要的是有思想力度的“厚重之书”。
在我的阅读记忆中，有几种课程讲义堪称其研究领域的经典著作。比如十九世纪法国历史建筑修复运动代表人物尤金-艾曼努尔·维奥莱-勒-迪克（Eugène-Emmanuel Viollet-le-Duc，1814-1879）的《建筑学讲义》（1860年），就是以作者约在1858年为学生开讲座课程时所写的讲义为主干而写成，作者在序言中说如果这个讲座课程能帮助学生“养成通过细致且深入的研究而非先入为主的偏见来建立自己的判断的习惯”，以及“培养出方法论精神”，就已经很好地完成了任务（《维奥莱-勒-迪克建筑学讲义》，白颖等译，中国建筑工业出版社，2015年，序言）。作为教师，我深知在今天要帮助学生排除因各种原因而产生的“先入为主的偏见”有多么困难，培养方法论的精神有多么重要。

在回答一位 Ubuntu 用户提出的关于精简 Ubuntu ISO 镜像的可能性的问题时，开发者确认正在开发一个官方的精简 ISO 镜像（小于 200MB）。上述工作已经在进行中，并取得了很大的进展。计划为即将发布的 Ubuntu 23.04 “Lunar Lobster” 引入一个替代性的精简安装程序。

Ubuntu 桌面的精简 ISO 镜像

Canonical/Ubuntu 从未正式支持过任何精简 ISO 镜像。在 Ubuntu 18.04 时代，遗留有一些非官方的 Ubuntu 精简 ISO 镜像，但它们都已经停产了。考虑到 Ubuntu Linux 的受欢迎程度，没有提供精简安装程序对一些人来说是个问题。

虽然有 Ubuntu 服务器镜像和 云镜像，但它们对于你的桌面使用情况来说，设置起来有点复杂。

例如，如果你想创建一个只有 GNOME 会话和基本功能的精简 Ubuntu 桌面，而不使用官方桌面安装程序，你只有一个选择：你需要安装 Ubuntu 服务器版作为基础，然后开始建立一个没有服务器组件的桌面。

虽然，Debian 已经提供了精简 ISO（即 netinst），它很容易使用，并且可以在任何程度上进行定制。但是，有一个类似于官方 Ubuntu 桌面定制版是一个好主意，可以根据需要建立你的系统（没有 Snap 或其他项目）。

根据邮件列表中的对话，ubuntu-mini-iso 的大小为 140MB，它需要通过网络下载几个软件包。它将提示你要下载的菜单项目。我猜它将类似于 Ubuntu 服务器版的菜单。



同样，Ubuntu 的所有官方版本都可能有一个精简版本。然而，我不确定当你包括一个桌面环境时，它将如何精简。Xubuntu 的开发者 Sean Davis 宣布，一个精简版的 Xubuntu 镜像已经在开发中，并且可以作为 日常构建版 下载。

所以，总的来说，这是 Canonical 的一个令人兴奋的举动。如果一切顺利的话，你实际上可以使用这个 ISO 构建你自己的 Ubuntu。你可以只添加 GNOME 桌面、删除 Snap、从 Debian 软件库中安装 Firefox，并添加任何你想要的软件包。这将是一个不错的精简版 Ubuntu 桌面。

Ubuntu 23.04 BETA 计划于 2023 年 3 月 30 日发布；最终版本预计于 2023 年 4 月 20 日发布。那时候你就可以试试 minimal-ubuntu-iso 了。

show no sign of abating in March either.  This time around, we look (again)
at tools for packaging, including a brand new Rust-based entrant.  There is
also a proposal to have interested parties create Python Enhancement
Proposals (PEPs) for packaging solutions that would be judged by a panel of
PEP delegates in order to try to choose something that the whole community

 Hi Reddit,
 Here's a script I put together with ChatGPT, since I don't have much scripting/coding experience. It aims to do the same thing Tronscript does for Windows.
 I've pasted the script below. I'll post a video of it running later today, once the initial run I'm currently attempting completes.
 Feedback is welcome. Feel free to take it and run with it!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Konstantin Ryabitsev has a
request for anybody who is using mutt for kernel work:


	At some point in the recent past, mutt changed the way it generates
	Message-ID header values. Instead of the perfectly good
	old way of doing it, the developers switched to using
	base64-encoded random bytes. The base64 dictionary contains the
	/ character, which causes unnecessary difficulties when
	linking to these messages on lore.kernel.org, since the /
	character needs to be escaped as %2F for everything to
	work properly.


The post includes a simple workaround for the problem.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[TL;DR: I've been a linux user for quiet some time now, and one thing has been a constant throughout the years. Nvidia has ALWAYS been extremely difficult to get working proberly, and it's always been a matter of compromises. So trying the new 530.30.02 beta drivers today, and seing that they just worked out of the box, with no configuration, and little to no bugs (that are noticable in a day to day use), brought a small tear to my eye. 
 Many people, including myself, have been sceptical about nvidia's open 'open sourcing' of their drivers, but maybe they ARE actually starting to turn around, and care for the linux community? I still reserve the rights to be sceptical, after all one good release doesn't neccesarily means that this is the new standard, but one can always hope!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am a proud Linux user (don't use Arch btw). Recently, I was reading research papers in my area of research "physics informed neural networks". I realised that people who disclose the PC's config in the research papers are either using Linux or WSL. They won't say they used Windows.
 You just need to search these terms in Google scholar.
  
For papers using WSL : link
 For papers using Linux : link
 For papers using Windows : link
  
This makes me real sad. People are actually using Linux but within Windows. These people are some of the most intelligent minds in their area of expertise. They are from NASA (this one), and top universities of the world in my research area. You can find a similar trend unless you enter in the research involving servers (might be incorrect) where you can't use Windows.Of course these people are not dumb, but they are even 100 times more technical in maths, computer science and electronics than a average "I use Arch btw" user.Why these smart people are also using Windows, specifically WSL but not just Linux? These people generally work in R&D and can't be forced to use Windows. They generally choose to use Windows, possibly, because it comes preinstalled? 
 EDIT
 For anyone reading this. I am not trying to force to use or insult anyone by saying "why they don't use Linux". I am trying to understand the challenges and potential solution to lure these talented individuals to Linux.

去年，著名的密码管理服务 LastPass 被入侵（#740），并被窃取了部分源代码和客户的保险库的 备份（859）。经过调查，该公司公布了更多关于其系统如何被攻击的细节，“威胁者利用从一名高级 DevOps 工程师那里偷来的有效凭证来访问一个共享的云存储环境……这是通过瞄准该工程师的家用电脑并利用一个脆弱的第三方媒体软件包来完成的。威胁者能够在员工用 MFA 认证后，捕捉到员工输入的主密码，并获得该工程师的 LastPass 公司保险库的访问权。”

老王点评：远程工作越来越流行，其带来的安全风险敞口不可忽视。




Gmail 客户端加密现在公开可用

谷歌现在对谷歌工作空间企业版、教育版和教育标准版客户开放了 Gmail 客户端加密（CSE）。一旦启用，Gmail CSE确保作为电子邮件正文和附件（包括内联图像）的一部分发送的任何敏感数据在到达谷歌的服务器之前将是不可读和加密的。同样重要的是要注意，电子邮件的标题（包括主题、时间戳和收件人名单）将不会被加密。

老王点评：其实类似的技术，如 PGP，早就有了，但是一直难以推广开来。




OpenAI 现在与其承诺背道而驰

OpenAI 成立于 2015 年，原本是一家非营利性研究机构。在其成立声明中，该公司宣布其研究承诺 “以最有可能造福全人类的方式推进数字智能，不受产生经济回报的限制”。OpenAI 鼓励所有研究人员分享 “论文、博文或代码，我们的专利（如果有的话）将与世界共享”。但八年后的今天，我们面对的是一家既不透明也不以积极的人类影响为动力的公司。OpenAI 摆脱了其非盈利地位，建立了一个 “封顶利润” 部门，该公司现在可以接受投资，并将为投资者提供封顶为 100 倍的投资利润。OpenAI 也没有开源和公开它的技术，并且它开发的技术反而使更多人失业了。

老王点评：终究成了自己当初最讨厌的模样——问题是，在商业上还挺成功。]]></summary>

毫无疑问，科尔扎诺夫斯基（Sigizmund Krzhizhanovsky，1887-1950）是被重新发掘出来的二十世纪最伟大的俄罗斯作家之一，几十年来，他一直是个默默无闻的“文学局外人”，因为直到1988年，这位“被划掉的大师”的第一本小说集才得以出版。如今，已有六卷本的科尔扎诺夫斯作品集问世并附有详尽注释——这要归功于诗人学者瓦蒂姆·佩勒穆特（Vadim Perelmuter），他在苏联国家档案馆蒙尘的角落里发现了科尔扎诺夫斯的档案藏品，之后用了四十多年来整理和编纂其三千多页手稿，其中包括长篇与短篇小说、故事、文学评论、哲学论文、戏剧与电影剧本、戏剧理论、笔记以及未完成作品，科尔扎诺夫斯基得以从俄语中复活，重生于世界文化。自1990年代始，他的作品被翻译成德语、法语、葡萄牙语、波兰语（这是一次“回返”，科尔扎诺夫斯基出生于基辅一个波兰裔家庭，他生命的最后阶段靠翻译波兰语作品来维持生计），英语版的出版还在继续。科尔扎诺夫斯基酷爱英语，他最喜欢的作家是莎士比亚、斯威夫特、威尔斯、萧伯纳和爱伦·坡，他在莫斯科学术界最亲密的朋友是狄更斯专家与斯威夫特专家，他梦想着造访伦敦，在他的档案中还有一份伊丽莎白时代的指南纲要以及街道地图，他的长篇小说《慕肖森男爵之归来》的主人公就居住在伦敦。对他来说，英国始终是一个幻想，如今他也在英语中现身，英文译者特雷布尔（Joanne Turnbull）和福摩佐夫（Nikolai Formozov）出色地将他的奇思异想和存在主义的焦虑传递给了更多的读者。科尔扎诺夫斯基作品的中文版目前已有三部：《未来记忆》《骷髅自传》《字母杀手俱乐部》，均由广西科…]]></summary>

在拥有一个 OpenStack 生产环境和家庭实验室一段时间后，我可以肯定地说，从管理员和租户的角度置备工作负载和管理它是很重要的。

Terraform 是一个开源的基础设施即代码（IaC）软件工具，用于 置备provisioning网络、服务器、云平台等。Terraform 是一种声明性语言，可以作为你正在建设的基础设施的蓝图。你可以用 Git 来管理它，它有一个强大的 GitOps 使用场景。

本文介绍了使用 Terraform 管理 OpenStack 集群的基础知识。我使用 Terraform 重新创建了 OpenStack 演示项目。

安装 Terraform

我使用 CentOS 作为跳板机运行 Terraform。根据官方文档，第一步是添加 Hashicorp 仓库：

$ sudo dnf config-manager --add-repo https://rpm.releases.hashicorp.com/RHEL/hashicorp.repo


接下来，安装 Terraform：

$ sudo dnf install terraform -y


验证安装：

$ terraform –version


如果你看到返回的版本号，那么你已经安装了 Terraform。

为 OpenStack 提供者创建一个 Terraform 脚本

在 Terraform 中，你需要一个 提供者provider，它是一个转换器，Terraform 调用它将你的 .tf 转换为对你正在协调的平台的 API 调用。

有三种类型的提供者：官方、合作伙伴和社区：


官方提供者由 Hashicorp 维护。

合作伙伴提供者由与 Hash…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[加拿大和美国从星期一（2月27日）开始禁止在政府设备上使用TikTok。白宫给联邦机构30天的时间来停止使用这一流行的社交媒体应用程序，以实施国会12月批准的禁令。这一禁令在执法、国家安全和研究方面规定了有限的例外。


联邦首席信息安全官克利斯·德鲁沙（Chris DeRusha）说：“该指南是政府为保护我们的数字基础设施和保护美国人民的安全和隐私而做出的持续承诺的一部分。”


由于担心用户的数据安全性和该应用程序可能被用来宣传中国政府的观点，中国公司字节跳动旗下的TikTok受到了西方政府的审查。该公司驳斥了这些担忧，并将禁令称为“政治剧场。”


中国外交部发言人星期二（2月28日）在新闻发布会上说，美国“过度扩大国家安全概念，利用国家权力打压别国公司。”


预计美国众议院的共和党人将于星期二通过一项法案，该法案将赋权乔·拜登总统在全国范围内禁止TikTok的使用。


在加拿大，总理贾斯汀·特鲁多说，针对政府设备的TikTok禁令可能会向广大民众发出信号。特鲁多说：“我想随着政府采取重要步骤，告诉所有联邦雇员他们不能再在工作电话上使用TikTok，许多加拿大的企业和个人将反思他们数据的安全性，并做出选择。”


欧盟委员会和欧盟理事会上个星期禁止其员工在工作电话上使用TikTok。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am simply making computer cases with motherboards, GPU, CPU and all, then sell them. I have one SSD with linux and some big games installed with steam on it. I just plug them in any motherboard, it totally works in any motherboard! Then I can test it with games etc. Most games work well enough in latest systems anyway. In windows this is hell, SSD doesn't work well with different motherboards, installing drivers takes too much damn time, whereas installing drivers and removing drivers in linux takes minutes. And also random windows updates that always crank on me, I am selling this guy some pc case, and time is late too. BAM, windows forced update! 10 minutes gone.. So I know linux, I thought why not do it like that?
 Only thing is that I don't know any good benchmarking software though for linux. Most people in windows use furmark, is there good alternative for linux lately?

We do this by identifying specific tasks that AI can solve well and providing simple APIs that any developer can start using straight from our website.
We built Pyq because it took too long to build features that were powered by AI at our previous jobs. A lot of people want to get started using AI, but struggle because of the difficulties involved in managing infrastructure, finding the right model and learning how to call it. There are many interesting and useful models in places like Github or Hugging Face, as well as specific applications of popular models like OpenAI’s GPT, but they require a decent amount of work/knowledge to get working in you…]]></summary>

In a nutshell crul is a tool for querying and building web and api data feeds from anywhere to anywhere.
With crul you can crawl and transform web pages into csv tables, explore and dynamically query APIs, filter and organize data, and push data sets to third party data lakes and analytics tools. Here’s a demo video, we’ve been told Nic sounds like John Mayer (lol) (https://www.crul.com/demo-video)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[用于 macOS（如果你需要的话，也包括 Linux）的附加软件包管理器。




如果你在 Mac 上的终端窗口工作，Homebrew 是一个方便的工具，它可以让你快速、轻松地安装广泛的 FOSS 世界中各种熟悉的工具。

这个附加的软件包管理器不需要超级用户权限，可以将程序安装到你的主目录中：它 “对 macOS 的作用就像 apt-get 对 Debian 的作用”。新版本 4.0.0 比以前更快，特别是在更新过程中。自动更新现在每天运行一次，而不是像 3.6 版那样每 5 分钟一次。虽然支持各种 Linux 发行版 —— 其基本要求非常宽松，内核 3.2 或更新版本，以及 Glibc 2.13 或更新版本 —— 但新版本不再正式支持 WSL1。



Homebrew 团队合影，包括 “冒泡啤酒” —— 项目负责人 Mike McQuaid

尽管 macOS 有 FOSS 的 基础，但苹果公司的产品是针对 Mac 用户设计的，他们倾向于生活在一个图形化的、点击式的世界里。这可能会让来自 Linux 的移民感到困惑：尽管 Mac 的终端环境继承了很多表面上看起来熟悉的来自 FreeBSD 的工具，但它们往往是过时的版本，或者有细微的不同。Linux 用户期望能够仅仅通过 apt 安装 python-3.11 或类似的工具。

这正是 Homebrew 被设计来解决的问题：安装 Homebrew 包，然后你输入 brew install python@3.11 就可以了。而且，至关重要的是，如果你在 macOS 上安装一个新版本的 Python，你可能会破坏操作系统的其他部分，而使用 Homebrew，你安装的任何东西都是你自己的 —— 它不会影响整个操作系统，也不会影响任何其他用户。

Homebrew 最初是为 macOS 建立的，但事实证明这个概念对 Linux 用户也很有用。你可能没有机器的 root 权限 —— 或者即使你有，那也可能只让你安装古老的版本，这些版本没有什么帮助，但你不能轻易更新。

该项目负责人 Mike McQuaid —— 当 Reg FOSS 部门的人在 FOSDEM 上见到他时，他正 穿着 华丽的衣服，像一杯冒泡的啤酒 —— 告诉我们：


Linux 上的 Homebrew 曾经是一个被称为 “Linuxbrew” 的独立复刻。但随着时间的推移，到了如今这些努力和我们已经完全是一个项目了，共享我们的团队和基础设施等等。

它最初的用途是在高端生物信息学机器上，用户没有 root 权限来使用系统的软件包管理器，但想在该机器上从软件包管理器安装新的软件。


以前独立的 Linuxbrew 复刻早在 2019 年就被 并入 了主项目的 1.9 版本。McQuaid 解释说，Homebrew 项目一些特异的 术语，例如，“酒桶（cask）” 和 “水龙头（tap）”，都源自于合并的各种项目：


Homebrew Cask 是一个独立的项目（现在基本上已经统一），允许 Homebrew 用于安装闭源软件的上游二进制包（相比之下，我们的主仓库 homebrew-core 只允许我们从源头构建自己的二进制的开源软件），例如 Chrome、Firefox 等。

Homebrew 的 “我们从源代码构建” 的描述文件被称为 “配方（formulae）”，我们用它构建我们的二进制包，“瓶子（bottle）”。

Homebrew 的 “分发上游二进制文件” 的描述文件被称为 “酒桶（cask）”。


Homebrew 也可以在 Windows 10 或 11 上的 WSL 内工作，尽管在版本 4 中只支持 WSL2。它支持 Debian 和 Red Hat 家族的发行版，包括 Ubuntu、CentOS 和 RHEL，可以运行在 x86-64 和 Arm 32/64 机器上。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello everyone, so while studying the kernel I noticed that a lot of reusable code blocks(like in certain APIs like kfifo) seem to be macros instead of functions. 
 My question is why is that the case? Why use macros and not of functions?
 ​
 My initial guess was that this approach prevents the creation of new stack frames which is good since the kernel stack is limited.
 ​
 Something, however, tells me that there might be more to this and that my initial guess may not be as accurate. So I would like to know if someone could educate me on this.
 ​
 This also raises another question, which has to do with good software writing practices (which is something I AM NOT very knowlegeable about) in C/C++ in particular. When should one use macros and when should one opt for functions instead? What is the deciding factor? Besides the obvious "less stack frames", what is the advantage of macro blocks over functions?
 ​
 PS: I apologize if this question sounds stupid, but it's one which has been bugging me for some time now.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[据报道，近日，沃尔玛向员工发出明确指令，要求不得将任何与沃尔玛相关的信息分享至ChatGPT等生成式人工智能系统内。在发给员工的内部邮件中，沃尔玛负责技术和软件工程的部门沃尔玛全球科技表示，“在注意到给公司造成风险的活动之后”，该部门此前屏蔽了ChatGPT一段时间。“随后，我们花时间评估和制定了一套关于生成式人工智能系统的使用指南，目前已经在沃尔玛内部网络中开放了ChatGPT的使用。”


关于该公司何时屏蔽了ChatGPT，以及所谓的有风险活动是什么性质，沃尔玛发言人没有做出回应，仅仅在声明中称：“大多数新技术既能带来新的帮助，也会制造新的风险。对我们来说，评估这些新技术并向员工提供使用指南是常见的举措。”


在新的指南中，沃尔玛告诉员工，应该“避免在ChatGPT中输入任何敏感、机密或私有的信息”，例如财务信息、战略信息，以及关于购物者和员工的个人信息。邮件还称，员工“不应该在这些工具中输入有关沃尔玛业务的任何信息，包括业务流程、政策或战略。”


邮件表示，在接受系统提供的信息之前，沃尔玛员工必须对这些系统的输出进行评估。员工不应该将软件代码剪切或复制到这些工具中，也不应该使用这些工具来编写新的代码。


根据邮件，“将沃尔玛的信息输入这些工具中可能会暴露公司的情况，可能违反保密协议，并可能严重损害我们对代码、产品、信息或内容的权利。每一名员工都有责任以正确的方式使用和保护沃尔玛的数据。”


在邮件的最后，沃尔玛表示，ChatGPT“可以提高效率，带来创新”，但这些生成式人工智能工具必须以“适当的方式”去使用。


近期，关于将机密信息输入ChatGPT，亚马逊和微软等公司也向员工发出类似的警告。]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Safari 将爆发性地带来 135 项功能

苹果即将发布的 Safari 16.4 及其 WebKit 引擎将带来重大更新，如支持主屏幕 Web 应用的网络推送通知、可构建的 CSS 样式表对象、声明式影子 DOM、iFrame 延迟加载、新的 JavaScript 导入地图功能、WASM SIMD 支持等等。这些都是很大的变化，在一定程度上缓解了开发者对 Safari 成为新 IE 的担忧。为什么苹果现在要在网络技术方面加大投入呢？这可能与欧盟数字市场法案有关，该法案可能要求苹果允许第三方浏览器在 iOS 上使用 WebKit 之外的引擎，以及要求允许从第三方应用商店侧载应用。

老王点评：苹果对实施网络技术犹豫不决的可能原因是，它有助于确保 iOS 的应用程序由应用商店提供。现在面临法案管理，才一口气发出这么多的功能。




Meta 发布能运行在单张显卡上的大语言模型

Meta 上周宣布了一个新的大语言模型 LLaMA-13B，称其参数规模更小但性能强于 OpenAI 的 GPT-3 模型，且它能运行在单张显卡上。LLaMA 语言模型的规模从 70 亿到 650 亿参数，而 OpenAI GPT-3 模型有 1750 亿个参数。Meta 使用 Common Crawl、维基百科和 C4 等公开数据集训练其模型。LLaMA-13B 模型在多项基准测试中的性能超过了 GPT-3。GPT-3 等模型需要数据中心规模的计算能力进行处理，而 LLaMA-13B 能运行在单张显卡上。

此外，Nebuly AI 推出了首个基于人类反馈强化学习的 LLaMA AI 聊天机器人开源实现 ChatLLaMA。

老王点评：在新的 AI 军备竞赛中，AI 技术将得到空前的发展，变化将可能令人目不暇接。




未来的福特汽车可能会自动跑路

福特公司申请了一项专利“收回车辆的系统和方法”。该专利详细描述了几种方法，使那些错过了几次汽车付款的人的生活更加艰难。该系统可以安装在汽车制造商未来任何有数据连接的车辆上，能够禁用“车辆的一个或多个部件的功能”，从发动机到空调等一切。对于具有自主或半自主驾驶能力的车辆，该系统可以 “将车辆从第一地点移动到更便于拖车拖曳的第二地点……诸如收回机构的场所”，或者，如果贷款机构认为 “执行收回程序的财务可行性” 不合理，车辆可以自己开到垃圾场。

电影《商海通牒》（Margin Call）讲述的是华尔街一家金融银行逃过金融危机的惊险前夜，电影中有这样一个情节，威尔一年赚两百五十万美元，当同事问起他是怎么花的，他开始算：
税收拿走一半，这样，就剩一百二十五万了。
房贷得还个三十万。
又给父母十五万拿去花。
“这多少了？”他问同事。
“八十万？”同事说。
“没错，八十万。”他说。
十五万买车。
七万五千花在吃上。
大概五万买衣服。
然后四十万存起来，以防万一。
“明智。”同事夸赞道。
“嗯，看起来金融风暴快来了。”他说。
“还有十二万五千呢？”同事问。
“我花了七万六千五百二十美元在荤场子上，主要是嫖妓。”
两个同事低头笑起来。
“七万六千五百二十？”一个同事抬头想要确认。
“一开始我也很震惊，但后来我发现，可以用娱乐名义报销一大部分。”
这个插曲让富人的钱是怎么花的变得具体，或许如果不是在共度危机当中，这两个职位较低的同事不大可能了解到管理他们的企业高层的收入水平和消费方式。不过这毕竟是电影，现实生活中的富人是怎样一种生命体验与存在方式呢？《不安之街》完成了这样一项不太可能的研究，因为当富裕、十分富裕以具体的方式呈现出来的时候，它的研究难度远远超过社会学、人类学对贫穷、贫穷文化等经典议题。与之相对，从社会分层领域涌现的中产阶层研究尽管在近二十多年收获了瞩目的研究成果，仍旧面临对凌驾中产群体之上、让其感受到相对剥削感的权贵或富豪等“塔尖人物”往往以大而化之的形象出现，口诛笔伐，而又总是难免隔靴搔痒。由于特权阶级对自身隐私的极佳保护，真正的富人是看不见的，隐没于大众视野之外，于世俗社会留下若干流光溢彩和彩云易散。像是N年前我在西餐厅打工，在晚上快打样时，一位食客总是准时出现，在半小时之内吃完一块牛排。这…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[默认情况下，Ubuntu 禁用了 root 账户。你必须使用 sudo 命令来执行任何需要 root 权限的任务。

当然，这是为了你自己的安全。一直以 root 身份使用系统，就像手里拿着一把剑到处跑。它增加了把事情搞乱的机会。

以 root 身份登录在服务器中仍然很常见。在桌面方面，以 root 身份登录的情况相当少见。甚至 Kali Linux 也做了改变。

然而，有一些桌面用户想以 root 身份登录。这不是什么明智之举，但肯定是可以做到的。

在本指南中，我将向你展示如何在 Ubuntu 中 以 root 身份登录 GNOME 桌面。

如何在 GNOME 桌面上以 root 身份登录


🚧 我不建议在桌面上以 root 身份登录。你有 sudo 机制来满足你所有的 root 需求。只有在你有足够理由的情况下才这样做。本教程仅用于演示目的。你已经被警告过了。


步骤 1：启用 root 账户

你想以 root 身份登录。但默认情况下，root 账户是禁用的。第一步是启用它。

改变 root 账户的密码，这将为你启用 root 账户：

sudo passwd root




不言而喻，你不应该忘记 root 密码。

步骤 2：改变 GDM 配置


🚧 本教程的这一部分只对 GNOME 有效。请 检查你的桌面环境 并确保它是 GNOME。


Ubuntu 默认使用 GNOME，GNOME 使用 GDM 显示管理器。

为了允许以 root 身份登录到 GNOME，你需要对位于 /etc/gdm3/custom.conf 的 GDM 配置文件做一些修改。

对该配置文件做一个备份：

cp /etc/gdm3/custom.conf /etc/gdm3/custom.conf~


在最坏的情况下，如果你以某种方式把事情搞砸了，备份的文件可以用来从 TTY 上替换现有文件。

现在，用以下命令打开 GDM 文件：

sudo nano /etc/gdm3/custom.conf


并添加以下一行，允许 root 用户登录：

AllowRoot=true




按 Ctrl+X 退出 Nano，同时保存它。

步骤 3：配置 PAM 认证

现在，你必须配置 PAM 认证守护进程文件，它可以通过以下命令打开：

sudo nano /etc/pam.d/gdm-password


在这个文件中，你必须注释掉以下带有 # 号的一行，该符号拒绝 GUI 中的 root 访问：

auth   required        pam_succeed_if.so user != root quiet_success




保存修改并退出 nano 文本编辑器。

步骤 4：以 root 身份登录

现在，重启你的系统：

reboot


在登录界面，选择 Not listed 选项，在用户名中输入 root，并输入你在本指南开头配置的密码：



当你登录后，它就会通知你，“logged in as a privileged user”：



这就完成了! 现在，你正在以 root 身份运行你的 Ubuntu 系统。

以 root 用户身份运行系统时，你应该知道的事情

Ubuntu 默认禁用 root 账户是有原因的。想知道为什么吗？在这里你可以找到：


Ubuntu 中的 root 用户-你应该知道的重要事项


再说一遍，在你的桌面 Linux 系统中以 root 登录是不可取的。请遵守规范，远离这种（错误的）冒险。

《百器徒然袋》五十图，有“鬼之皮衣”，讲的是狐狸化为美女的故事，而其缘由则取自中国。此图大意是，寿过三千年的狐狸，身披藻草之衣，头顶骷髅，以拜北斗，骷髅如果不掉下来，则可化为美女。
据说事出自唐代段成式的笔记《酉阳杂俎》。现检其书卷十五《诺皋记下》有如下文：“旧说野狐名紫狐，夜击尾火出。将为怪，必戴髑髅拜北斗，髑髅不坠，则化为人矣。”
显然《百器徒然袋》对原文做了一些改动，《诺皋记下》中并没有“藻草”一类的字眼。如果不是藻草在日本有什么特殊的魔法，那么估计这“藻”是指华美的衣服。因为狐狸化为美女不可能没有衣服，所以要提前披上一件漂亮的衣服，而藻则有华美的意思。
这只是一个中国的传说，并没有成为日本的妖怪，所以水木茂就没有收入到他的《妖怪大全》中。
鸣釜

图中的文字是：“《白泽避怪图》曰：饭甑作声鬼，名敛女。有此怪，则呼鬼名，其怪忽自灭。于梦中思及此。”
《白泽避怪图》应该就是中国的《白泽图》，因为其中多有见某怪则“以其名呼之”，其怪则去，或灭，或有其他异征。也就是说知道此怪之名，则可使其避人，所以也可以叫《白泽避怪图》，但中国古书中似未见过这种书名。
《白泽图》一书不知哪个朝代就佚失了，我们现在所能见到的都是唐《法苑珠林》、宋《太平御览》等书中所引，另外就是敦煌写卷《白泽精怪图》。但以上几种书都没有这么一个名叫“敛女”的“饭甑作声鬼”。可是明末人徐应秋《玉芝堂谈荟》卷十三有一段：“釜甑鬼，名婆女。凡遇釜鸣，呼其名，不为灾。”这一段文例正合《白泽图》，而后接着的文字也是取自《白泽图》，所以鸟山所写的一段应该没什么问题，只是文字略有差异，意思是大致不错的。两种文字比较，我觉得《谈荟》较近真，作声的是“釜甑”，其鬼名“婆女”。
如果我们现在做饭用的敞口的大铁锅突然叫起来，那实在是不可思议，但“釜”则不然，它实际上就是去掉三个爪的“鬲”，看上去就和罐子差不多，肚大口小…]]></summary>

I think it's important to give some context for those of you who haven't followed the last few releases of some popular Linux distros. Fedora and PopOS have swap on zram by default, while Ubuntu, Arch and RHEL have zswap enabled by default. Both of these technologies attempt to improve performance under load by reducing how often you need to swap to disk, and they're absolutely game-changing for memory-constrained devices.
 From the Kernel documentation, zswap can be summarised as:
  
Zswap is a lightweight compressed cache for swap pages. It takes pages that are in the process of being swapped out and attempts to compress them into a dynamically allocated RAM-based memory pool. zswap basically …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi everyone,
Almost 2 years ago, I left my full-time job at Canon to build tooling and infrastructure to help developers write high-level tests for complex software workflows that are not easy to unit test. I wanted to take ideas from visual regression testing, snapshot testing, and property-based testing and build a general-purpose regression testing system that developers can use to find the unintended side-effects of their day-to-day code changes during the development stage.
After two years of working ~70 hours per week and going through multiple iterations, we finally have a fully open-source (Apache-2.0) product that finally makes me and other members of our community happy: https://github.com/trytouca/trytouca
This week we released v2.0, a milestone version that is useful to small and large teams alike. This version comes with:
- An easy to self-host server that stores test results for new versions of your software workflows, automatically compares them against a previous baseline version, and reports any differences in behavior or performance.
- A CLI that enables snapshot testing without using snapshot files. It lets you capture the actual output of your software and remotely compare it against a previous version without having to write code or to locally store the previous output.
- 4 SDKs in Python, C++, Java, JavaScript that let you write high-level tests to capture values of variables and runtime of functions for different test cases and submit them to the Touca server.
- Test runner and GitHub action plugins that help you continuously run your tests as part of the CI and find breaking changes before merging PRs.
I would really appreciate your honest feedback, positive or negative, about Touca. Would love to learn if you find this useful and look forward to hearing your thoughts and answering any questions.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[新版本的 Endless OS 5.0 已经发布，带来了更多的功能和稳定性。下面是对这个版本的简要点评。


在不变性成为炒作对象之前，Endless OS 已经提供了一种基于 OSTree 的高效桌面体验。它基于 Debian 和 Ubuntu，但正在独立开发。由于其底层基于 OSTree，Endless OS 运行在其用户空间中，同时给你最好的桌面体验。

它是一个适合学校、小规模部署、实验室和离线使用情况的完美发行版。

新版本的 Endless OS 5.0 现在已经推出。下面是对其功能的快速回顾和深入点评。


我们相信，个人计算对生产力、学习和工作技能至关重要。

我们在过去 10 年中致力于设计和提供操作系统和工具，使人们能够获得和控制他们的技术。

借助我们的工具，我们可以通过使用和发现来提高生产力、创造力和学习，我们帮助各种背景的人以更有意义的方式参与数字经济。

—— Endless OS 使命宣言


Endless OS 5 点评

由于这个操作系统的目的是为不太富裕的人提供数字计算的机会，所以它提供了 Windows 安装程序。你可以直接下载它并在 Windows 环境中试用。

此外，它还提供了一个专门的独立 ISO 镜像，可以通过 U 盘进行安装。

上次我在 2021 年点评 Endless OS 时，它并没有提供 ARM 版本。我很惊讶地发现，它现在有一个 ARM 镜像，你可以在树莓派和其他 ARM 板上试用。

在我的测试安装中，一切都很顺利。它使用一个自定义的安装程序，类似于 Fedora 的 Anaconda 安装程序。然而，安装它需要一个完整的磁盘。如果你喜欢双启动，在此 有一个详细的指南。但是，我觉得它的设置有点复杂。

	However, there is still a long road before upstream kernels are

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[在 M1 Mac 上还不能运行 Linux 6.2 内核的发行版

之前，ZDNet 报道说，“较新的 Mac 用户可以期待在他们的 M1 机器上运行 Linux（6.2）。”主要推动 M1 驱动开发的 Asahi Linux 称该报道是 “误导性的和近乎虚假的”。他们说，“你将无法在任何 M1 Mac 上运行带有 6.2 的 Ubuntu 或其它发行版。请不要抱太大希望。”虽然 Linux 6.2 增加了 M1 的基本的启动支持，但连 M1 Mac 的触控板、键盘都没有支持。目前可以在 M1 台式机上启动 16K 页面的 6.2 内核，但还没有一个提供 16K 的内核的 ARM64 发行版。未来，一旦 4K 内核可用，你可以期待零集成发行版可以驱动部分硬件。

老王点评：看来想在 M1 上运行 Linux 还需要较长的时间。




企业已经开始用 ChatGPT 取代员工

在对 1000 名企业负责人做的调查中，发现近半数企业部署了 ChatGPT，并开始使用它来取代部分员工。其中 66% 用于写代码，58% 用于文案和内容创作，57% 用于客户支持，52% 用于写会议摘要和其它文档。大部分企业负责人对 ChatGPT 的表现印象深刻，55% 的人认为工作质量“出色”，34% 的人认为“非常好”。几乎所有使用 ChatGPT 的公司表示节省了资金，48% 表示节省逾 50,000 美元，11% 表示节省逾 100,000 美元。

.NET 8 将加强对 Linux 的支持

.NET 8 是这个微软开源软件开发平台的下一个计划版本，它的第一个预览版已可下载。它是一个支持三年的 LTS 版本，将于 11 月投入生产环境。新版本将可以在 Linux 上直接从 dotnet/dotnet 资源库构建 .NET 运行时、工具和 SDK，这与红帽和 Canonical 用来构建 .NET 的构建方式相同，以后这种能力将被扩展到支持 Windows 和 macOS。


消息来源：Info World



老王点评：不知道 Linux 开发者对 .NET 的支持需求有多大。]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[洪子诚

不是，也不是
在一次采访中，洪子诚讲了下面这段话：上世纪八十年代末到九十年代，写完《作家的姿态与自我意识》就病了，邵燕君老师抱着《天龙八部》到我家，说你生病正好可以读金庸。过了一个月她来取，问我的读后感，我说第一本都没看完，她吃惊：你不看金庸，这一辈子要失去很多的乐趣的。
虽然被邵燕君正告了危险，但洪老师还是拒绝金庸。这个事情也让我想起我们师门的一次挫败。曾经，在罗岗和我的强力传销下，我们导师王晓明心一横，说，那拿，拿一套金庸我来看看。当时我刚刚搞了一套三联版的金庸全集，便选了《天龙八部》送到王老师手上。结果王老师和洪老师一样，没看完，而且，因为实在看不上吧，还给我的时候，还少了一本，这第五册《天龙八部》，还是五年前薛羽帮我重新补齐的。
因为这个事情，我更加相信，世界上就分两种人，一种喜欢金庸，一种不喜欢金庸。而每次我重温金庸，被独孤九剑葵花宝典大伏魔掌法弄得魂飞魄散时，总会叹息，洪老师们怎么会不喜欢金庸啊。如此，我阅读了洪老师谈阅读的几乎所有著作，希望找到蛛丝马迹。
别尔嘉耶夫是洪老师特别喜欢的作家，他引过别尔嘉耶夫的一句话，“俄罗斯民族不是纯粹的欧洲民族，也不是纯粹的亚洲民族”（《相关性问题：当代文学与俄苏文学》，《读作品记》，北京大学出版社，2017年）。这句话，也可以用来理解洪老师。他是存在于当代文学研究中的一个“不是，也不是”。他不激进，也不消极，他对那些“平平常常的人生，不像故事的故事，不像斗争的斗争”，有深刻的同情，他不拥抱浪漫主义，也不醉心现代主义，他既减弱了我们在两极摇摆的幅度，又沟通了潮流中的一些极端。看上去八字不合的东西，被洪子诚中介之后，用霍桑的话说，“变得息息相通”，而且彼此成了“对方的精神食粮”。

比如，洪老师看了很多苏联电影，从三四十年代的《夏伯阳》到五六十年代在中国受到批判的《第四十一》《士兵之歌》《伊凡的…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[周瑞璋信件

高中母校南京外国语学校副校长周瑞璋（1897-1975）1974年2月28日曾写给我一封信。我在南外读书时，他对我很是垂青，1966年初他写过的唯一一张大字报，就是他到我们班上，招手叫我去替他用毛笔抄出来的。内容是说某副校长是苏北来的数学名教师，何以连一笔学校用的外汇折算也搞不出来。不痛不痒说一点小事，好应付过去。1968年底我插队丹阳后，师生之间经常通信。几年后，公社安排我到当地中学教英语，他闻讯十分高兴，给我寄了不少英语教学书来，从语法教学到课堂用语。可惜只有1974年这封来信保留下来，第二年年初他就去世了，终年七十九岁。临终他要求用棺木，所以南外没有为他开追悼会——这是吴玉璋老师后来告诉我的。一位毕生奉献社会的教育家，无声无息地离开了人世。
周校长举止言谈十分儒雅，一口标准美语，可是又一口老南京话。他家世代教书，父亲周岐山先生是金陵大学中文教授，一生执教，七十岁才退休。周校长自幼就读于金陵大学附小、附中，1919年金陵大学毕业后，又赴美国芝加哥大学留学，此后曾任中央政治学校教授。1917年因家庭经济困难，他开始在基督教青年会中学半工半读做兼职教师，1919年任教务主任，1922年到1951年一直担任青中校长。校址在中华路，过了内桥，桥堍右手就是，解放后变成了分析仪器厂，他曾指着临街那座西洋气派嵌有壁灯的房子，如数家珍地告诉我，这是在他手里一砖一瓦盖起来的。“当时学生中有不少中共地下党员在活动，我睁一眼闭一眼，从不过问。”近闻这栋房子已作为重要文物保护，先是2013年向西平移几十米，次年在地基垫高六十厘米后，平移回到原地，继之修缮出新。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[最近升级的软件引起问题了？虽然你总是可以调查问题以解决它，但有时，回到以前的工作版本可以节省时间和精力。如果新的版本引入了一个 bug，你可以在你这一边什么都不做，对吗？

好消息是，你可以在 Ubuntu 和 Debian 中轻松地降级 apt 软件包。

你所要做的就是像这样使用 apt 命令：

sudo apt install package_name=package-version-number


这似乎很容易，但你如何获得确切的版本号？还有哪些旧版本被支持？你可以通过以下方式获得这个细节：

sudo apt-cache policy package_name


让我用一个现实生活中的例子来解释这些。

降级 apt 包

最近，我正在更新承载 It's FOSS 社区论坛的 Ubuntu 服务器。

我做了通常的 apt update && apt upgrade，在更新安装时，事情变得糟糕。

很明显，最新版本的 Docker 不支持 aufs 存储驱动。为了减少停机时间，我选择了降级到以前的 Docker 版本。

检查当前安装的软件包版本：



然后检查可以安装的可用版本：

sudo apt-cache policy package_name


它可能会抛出一个巨大的列表，或者只是一个小列表：



如果它显示至少有一个比当前版本更早的版本，你就很幸运了。

现在，你可能认为一个软件包的版本号将只由数字组成。但情况可能并不总是这样。

基本上，你复制 500（优先级数字）之前的全部内容。

brave-browser:
  Installed: 1.48.158
  Candidate: 1.48.164
  Version table:
     1.48.164 500
        500 https://brave-browser-apt-release.s3.brave.com stable/main amd64 Packages
 *** 1.48.158 500
        500 https://brave-browser-apt-release.s3.brave.com stable/main amd64 Packages
        100 /var/lib/dpkg/status
     1.47.186 500
        500 https://brave-browser-apt-release.s3.brave.com stable/main amd64 Packages
     1.47.171 500
        500 https://brave-browser-apt-release.s3.brave.com stable/main amd64 Packages
     1.46.153 500


当你得到了软件包的编号，用它来降级已安装的软件包，像这样：

sudo apt install package_name=package-version-number




当然，你会看到一个关于降级软件包的警告。



但是当这个过程完成，你的软件包就会被降级到给定的旧版本。

所以，也许要保留它？

所以，你刚刚学会了降级 apt 软件包。但如果你不注意的话，该软件包会在下一次系统更新时再次升级。

不希望这样吗？你可以 阻止一个软件包被更新。像这样使用 apt-mark 命令：

sudo apt-mark hold package_name


我希望这个快速技巧能帮助你在需要时降级 apt 软件包。如果你有问题或建议，请告诉我。

学者们经常将他们的作品免费提供给公司，然后却要花钱购买它！你能想象农民在免费送出他们的食物之后再重新花钱买回来做晚餐吗？可能不能吧。像我这样的学者陷入这样的阴谋中几十年了，我们以工作保障为交换免费提供我们的作品，然后却要每年花几百万美元来阅读我们自己的文章。

幸运的是，情况正在发生改变。我刚刚完成的一项 研究 的结果显示：对于学者来说，获得工作保障的同时而不对此付出代价是可能的。我的研究发现数百种期刊是 白金开放获取platinum open access（LCTT 译注：译名源自中文网络）的 —— 也就是说，它们不需要作者或者读者为同行评议的工作付费，却仍然拥有帮助学者在他们的职业生涯中取得成功的声望和读者群。

这一趋势正在扩张：开放获取期刊目录 罗列了超过 17300 种期刊，这些期刊均提供了某种程度上的 开放获取open access（OA）方式。该目录还提供了超过 12250 种无须 文章处理费article-processing charges（APC）的期刊。我使用一段简易的开源 Python 脚本 来将该列表与另一按照期刊发表的文章被其他文章引用的频次排名的期刊列表（期刊影响因子列表）进行比较。很明显，最近几年来，总体的开放获取期刊与白金开放获取期刊均呈上升趋势。这一趋势可能有助于在避免学术奴役的同时加速科学发展。

学者的窘境

学者们通常是相当聪慧的，那么他们为什么如此长时间地投身于这种不利体系中呢？简而言之，学者陷于这样一个陷阱中：为了维系他们的工作和获得终身教职，他们需要在高 影响因子impact factor 的期刊上发表文章。影响因子是一种基于最近两年间在给定期刊上发表的文章的平均引用数量的衡量指标。影响因子由 Web of Scien…]]></summary>

 As someone who is constantly sharing and receiving GIFs to show UI details or bug reports, I wanted to have the ability to view them like a regular video (slowdown, seek to, etc). This is a small experiment I made to build something as lightweight as possible --no GTK or QT, and certainly not Electron-- but also with a modern look.
 It's written in C on top of Sokol and microui --with a few additions of my own-- and has no dependencies other than X11 and OpenGL (Sokol doesn't support Wayland at the moment). I have to clean up the codebase a bit before sharing it, but if you want to try it out you can download an x64 AppImage over here.
 Thanks for reading and let me know what you think!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In the first part of the series we have talked generally about what are namespace and what we can do with them — in case you want to go over it you can use the following link https://medium.com/@boutnaru/linux-namespaces-part-1-dcee9c40fb68. Now we are going to deep dive into pid namespaces.
 The goal of PID namespaces is to isolate the “Process ID number space”. Thus, different processes in distinct PID namespaces can have the same PID. When a new PID namespace is started the first process gets PID 1 (so we don’t have a new swapper — https://medium.com/@boutnaru/the-linux-process-journey-pid-0-swapper-7868d1131316). In order to use PID namespaces we have to ensure that our kernel was compiled with “CONFIG_PID_NS” enabled (https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/pid_namespaces.7.html).

Package pre-compiled binaries (that require / installation to work)
 Use an apt package in non-debian systems
 Use a pacman package on non-arch systems
 Use a pip package without installing pip/python
 Use a npm package without installing npm/nodejs
 Compile an application without installing dependencies on the host

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello HN,
In my spare time I work on an experimental search engine named Ichido. Search is fascinating, there are so many features you can add to a search engine, but I find that the existing search engines are a bit limited in the features they have to offer. So I decided to work on my own search engine to test out different features, searching algorithms, and front ends in order to improve my (and hopefully others) searching experience.
Ichido includes a tagging system that provides more info on search results. For example, if a site links to Google services or uses Cloudflare, a tag is shown with the search result that let's the user know about that site's use of those services. Ichido also includes links to RSS feeds in search results, making it much easier to find RSS feeds.
This search engine is free to use, but if you like the service and want to support continued development please consider making a donation (Ichido currently supports donations through Libera Pay).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I was looking for a new distro for myself and was stunned by how few options there are, despite the fact, there's like a bazilion existing distros. Generally you can divide them into 4 categories: 1. Ubuntu LTS/Debian based "oldies" 2. Arch based "bleeding edge" 3. Wacky enthusiast distros 4. Fedora
 What do I mean by that? Well, basically every Ubuntu-based distro is using LTS edition, which is fine for the first few months, but as soon as new hardware arrives, and as time passes it works worse and worse, for example 22.04 is unusable for me on RX7900XTX, simply because drivers either don't work or crash all the times, reason beeing old libraries. There are SOME exceptions, that backport a lot, like Pop OS, but if you wand fairly recent versions and Ubuntu base - well, Ubuntu or nothing. On the other end there are Arch based - and don't get me wrong, Arch is great. But you know how it's like with bleeding edge - it cuts you. So yes, recent, but not stable. And there are these wacky weird distros for absolute enthusiasts - Gentoo, LFS, Void, Solus. They are OK, but often don't have any suppory for hardware except bare minimum offered by LTS kernel. And there's Fedora - sharp edge, but still stable. But Fedora has its own problems I noticed by daily driving it for 2 years.
 So there we are - if you want a distro, that is fairly recent in terms of packages, hardware support, but still stable you have Ubuntu non-LTS, Pop and Fedora. Am I weird, or is it just... Too few? Ultimately we want more people to start using Linux. And they won't if they have only 3 options. Cuz really - a casual user will just plunk distro in the drive, and if something like WiFi, GPU, Bluetooth won't work they'll just go back to Windows. 
 And I know about Snaps and Flatpaks! But sorry - you wont provide Mesa, AMDGPU, NVidia or WiFi card drivers with Flatpak. This is the issue. 
 So yeah - more distros that are "in between" - recent but stable.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[在美国的三权分立体制下，总统和国会两院分别代表着最高行政与立法权，而最高法院则代表着司法权的塔尖。美国最高法院的职责是通过判罚来诠释包括宪法在内的所有法律。最高法院的判决往往会对美国社会和经济制度产生深远的影响。


作为美国司法体系的最终裁决者，美国最高法院每年都会接到8000多起下级法院的诉讼请求，但九人组成的最高法院只会挑选其中的80起焦点案件。这些案件的判决可能会对美国社会经济产生深远影响。正因为如此，只要被最高法院受理的案件都会成为媒体关注的焦点。


上周美国最高法院开庭审理的两起案件，就吸引了全美国科技行业和媒体机构的聚焦。因为这两起案件的判决结果，将直接关系到美国互联网行业过去二十多年繁荣昌盛的保护伞。如果最高法院做出对互联网公司不利的判决，那么整个美国互联网行业的监管体系都要进行重建。


两大恐怖袭击相关诉讼


这两起诉讼究竟是什么来历背景？为什么会如此重要，直接关系到美国互联网行业的基石？


上周二，美国最高法院就“冈萨雷斯诉谷歌”（Gozalez v． Google）诉讼进行了超过两个半小时的庭审。紧接着第二天，最高法院又就“推特诉塔梅”（Twitter v． Taamneh）进行了近三个小时的庭审。两起诉讼有着相似的背景，都指向同一个核心问题：互联网公司是否要为自己平台上用户发布的内容承担责任？


先来看“冈萨雷斯诉谷歌”案，诺伊米·冈萨雷斯（Nohemi Gonzalez）原本是加州大学长滩分校的一名大四学生，2015年在法国巴黎做交换生。2015年11月13日-14日，恐怖组织伊斯兰国（IS）在巴黎多个地区连续发动恐怖袭击，共造成130人死亡和368人受伤。正在餐厅和朋友吃饭的23岁的诺伊米遭到恐怖分子开枪扫射，不幸中弹身亡。

谷歌超过四分之一的全职员工都在其云计算部门。现在，谷歌正在要求云计算员工“分享他们的办公桌，并从下个季度开始与他们的拼桌伙伴交替工作。”这样做是为了让公司可以腾退一些办公楼，“能够继续投资于云计算的发展”。他们希望员工能隔天来上班，这样他们就不会在同一天在同一张办公桌上。

老王点评：就像云计算资源池和超卖一样，谷歌云真是将云计算理念运用到了“实处”。




AI 对资本家最有用

有观点认为，AI 对资本家最有用。除非 AI 是开源的，且由终端用户控制，否则除了 AI 的软件供应商，其他人的未来可能是暗淡的。像 GPT-3 之类的大语言模型能用于扩展人类的工作或帮助完成枯燥的工作，就像程序员用 Copilot 加快工作效率，律师、医生、会计师、营销人员等都将会有自己的 AI 助手。就像智能手机，在生活中无处不在，成为生活必用品。没有它们我们的生活几乎寸步难行，而提供这些产品的公司变得极其富有而强大。这些产品带来的生产力提升只受益于少数人，这些企业也只雇佣少数人，绝大部分人的工资停滞不前。


消息来源：Me Bassett



老王点评：我不同意这个观点，AI 会像智能手机一样成为生活必需品，但是没有人因为智能手机而失业和变得更贫困。我更担心的是，AI 回头会觉得人类是累赘。




美国 NASA 发起 “开源科学倡议”，敦促采用开放科学

NASA 科学数据官 Steve Crawford 介绍了 NASA 的开源科学计划。他用 “尽可能的开放、必要的限制、永远的安全” 来概括这一政策。具体来说，“出版物应该公开，没有禁运期，包括研究数据和软件。数据应以知识共享零许可（CC0）方式发布，软件应以常用的许可方式发布，如 Apache、BSD 或 MIT。新政策还鼓励使用和贡献于开源软件”。并且，NASA 更新了政策，明确其员工可以以其官方身份为开源项目做出贡献。此外，作为该计划的一部分，NASA 已经开始了一项为期五年、耗资 4000 万美元的向开放科学转型任务。


消息来源：LWN



老王点评：有一点我是服的 —— 美国的很多国家机构，真是拿开源当回事，而不是只知道用开源。而且，他们真敢开源一些看起来“敏感”的领域的技术。]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[马丁·普克纳（章静绘）

在欧美学界，关于古代文明的研究，无论是古典学、亚述学还是埃及学等，都逐渐式微，生存空间日益被现当代研究挤压。与此同时，古代研究与现当代研究日益脱轨、鸿沟越来越大。然而，出身于现代文学研究、现为哈佛大学拜伦和安妮塔·维恩讲席教授的马丁·普克纳（Martin Puchner）是一例外，他除了在柏拉图戏剧理论方面有过专著外，还从大历史、长时段的角度于近期在诺顿出版社出版了《文化：我们的故事，从岩画到韩流》（Culture: the Story of Us, From the Cave Art to K-pop）。在这本书中，普克纳对从古到今有代表性的文化现象进行了深入浅出的介绍，以技术与文化为主线，向读者介绍了人类如何从史前人类岩洞石画到今天社交媒体时代的文化发展。在正文的十五章里，有九章的内容是关于古代文明的，这凸显了普克纳对古代研究的重视，也展示了一位比较文学学者对人类过去的独特反思，更体现了他对人文学科未来的思考。值得注意的是，作为哈佛大学“戏剧、舞蹈与媒体”项目的创始人，普克纳在书里还关注了现在席卷欧美的韩国流行音乐（K-pop）。与一般学者仅仅认为韩流是青少年追星不同，普克纳认为韩流是我们这个时代一项重要的文化交流现象，更提醒人文学者文化是什么。此前，研究中国大众文化历史的李孝悌教授在《上海书评》的专访中强调，学者要重视“逸乐”的价值。此番普克纳则从长时段的视角去看待作为当代“逸乐”的韩流的价值。

您在书中首先介绍了肖维（Chauvet）岩画，之后书中第一个故事是关于古埃及王后娜芙提提（Nefertiti）的。我能理解您为什么这样做，但也许，亚述学家对此会不太开心。您为何选择从埃及开始讲述而不是美索不达米亚？
普克纳：写作时，我没考虑过…]]></summary>

        <updated>2023-02-26T02:19:19.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Flathub 正在为全面的改变和改进做准备。以下是你需要了解的情况。




作为一个 Flatpak 仓库，Flathub 一直非常受欢迎，并且它也是 Canonical 的 Snap Store 的良好替代品。

而现在，背后支持它的 GNOME 和 KDE 等准备更进一步，启动了一个 完全的品牌重塑和发展该平台的计划。

让我们看看 Flathub 的未来。

Flathub 的品牌重塑



随着 GNOME 的 Jakub Steiner 带头进行的品牌重塑，Flathub 的外观和感觉都将发生改变。

他专注于使 Flathub 的新形象不至于太 “喧宾夺主”，而将重点始终放在应用程序本身。

他还提到：


在中性灰色的基础上建立一个品牌并不容易，但这恰恰是针对 Flathub 品牌的要点。

它为应用程序创造了闪耀的舞台，Flathub 本身并不炫目，它让应用程序成为你注意力的中心。


如果你对 UI/UX 感兴趣，我建议你阅读他的 博文，以更详细地了解 Flathub 的新视觉识别。

Flathub 应用商店的发展



GNOME 基金会 和 KDE e.V 在建立和改进 Flathub 方面一直进展良好。自 2017 年推出以来，Flathub 一直在以非常惊人的速度发展着。

发生了什么？ 在上个月的一项最新 提案 中，计划了一些值得关注的事情，重点是使 Flathub 成为一个激励其发布者的 Linux 应用生态系统。

简单来说，他们想把 Flathub 变成一个成熟的应用商店，让发布者可以从他们的应用中获得收益，这应该会改善资金状况。

为什么？ 这样做的理由是；如今的这种资金障碍阻碍了潜在的开发者开发开源应用程序，这反过来又阻碍了整个开源生态系统的发展。

提案中强调的另一件事是：


健康的应用程序生态系统对于开源软件桌面的成功至关重要，以便最终用户可以信任并控制他们面前的设备上的数据和开发平台。


Flathub 将如何实现这一目标？ 定期捐赠或订阅系统是该计划的主要补充之一。

🛠️ 诸如防止滥用应用程序收录的审查工具、自动安全扫描，以及一些更细微的变化都已进入计划。

此外，Flathub 需要工具来防止误导性的应用名称、描述、屏幕截图等出现在平台上，并阻止它们，直到它们被审查，以保证被检查过。

总的来说，总结一下，以下是你可以期待的事情：


定期捐款系统或订阅系统

付费的应用程序

改进 Flathub 的应用审查流程和监测更新变化的内部工具


你可能会发现一些实施方案已经出现在 Flathub 的测试门户，比如 新的应用程序验证系统。

此外，他们打算建立一个新的法律实体 Flathub LLC，来拥有和运营这项服务。

他们旨在通过它建立以下内容：


透明的治理流程以维护社区信任和问责制，并建立一个咨询委员会/赞助流程以在我们的拨款申请的同时吸引商业赞助。


💸 现在你可能在想，他们预算如何？

该提案提到，未来一年的总预算为 20 万美元。

其中包括 12 万美元的员工工资，以及 3 万美元的法律、专业和管理费用，最后 5 万美元用于平台的开发。

他们已经有 5 万美元用于前一阶段的开发，另外还有 10 万美元已经确认，所需预算的 50% 已经有了。

剩余的 10 万美元已经从 Plaintext Group 寻求，该集团是由 谷歌前 CEO 埃里克·施密特 创立的 Schmidt Futures 的一部分。

总结

好吧，我必须说这是一个非常值得关注的举措。

Flathub 已经受到了各类 Linux 用户的欢迎。因此，推动有助于资助该项目的功能，将 Flathub 变成一个丰富的应用生态系统，有望成为桌面用户的通用 Linux 应用平台。

💬 可能这就是 Linux 桌面用户所需要的。你怎么看？请在下面的评论中分享你的想法。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[According to the License Agreement (EULA) of distributions like openSUSE (Leap 15.4), Fedora, AlmaLinux or Rocky Linux, those may be subject to the U.S. Export Administration Regulations (EAR). But that make me ask how is the enforcement of that license and how it is guaranteed that the usage of that open source piece of software is not used for the activities that are banned (e.g. space launch, unmanned vehicles...) and in sanctioned countries.
 I mean, the vast majority are not going to use the OS for such activities, but how openSUSE/Fedora/AlmaLinux/Rocky Linux projects guarantee that license? Would it be with telemetry and constant spying on users activity?
 I have only seen that kind of EULA in RPM-based distros (i.e. not on PCLinuxOS) such as those mentioned before, but I do not know if that have anything to do with the companies/developers behind or applies to all US-based operating systems.

有人发现，当试图使用 Edge Canary 下载和安装 Chrome Canary 时，Edge 浏览器窗口中会出现了一个宣传 Edge 优点的横幅广告，广告中说，“微软 Edge 运行在与 Chrome 相同的技术上，并有微软的额外信任”。Canary 渠道发布的是实验性的浏览器版本。随后几天，人们发现 Edge 的 Canary、Dev 和 Stable 等发布不再显示该广告。顺便说一句，Edge 在全球浏览器市场上有约 4.6% 的份额。

.NET 运行环境初步支持 RISC-V

三星的程序员为 .NET 运行环境提交了代码，提供了初步的 RISC-V 构建支持。该代码已经成功测试了 RISC-V 的交叉构建，甚至可以在 RISC-V 上运行一个简单的 “hello world” 应用。不过，微软并没有计划把 Windows 带到 RISC-V 上。


消息来源：Phoronix



老王点评：看起来三星有想法在 RISC-V 上运行 .NET 程序。




84% 的代码库中至少发现一个开源代码漏洞

几乎所有的软件都包含开源代码。Synopsys 公司 2022 年审计的 1703 个的商业和专有代码库中，96% 的代码库包含开放源代码。在他们检测的代码库中，有 84% 至少会发现一个已知的开源代码漏洞。其中，48% 的代码库包含高风险漏洞，即那些已经被积极利用的漏洞，已经有记录的概念验证漏洞，或者被归类为远程代码执行漏洞。


消息来源：CSO Online



老王点评：随着开源代码的滥觞，没有正确维护的开源代码带来的安全风险或许要超过开源代码带来的好处。]]></summary>

控制结构是编程语言的一个重要特征，因为它们使你能够根据通常在程序运行时动态建立的条件来指导程序的流程。不同的语言提供了不同的控制，在 Lua 中，有 while 循环、for 循环和 repeat until 循环。这篇文章涵盖了 while 和 repeat until 循环。由于它们的灵活性，我在一篇 单独的文章 中介绍 for 循环。

条件是由一个使用运算符的表达式来定义的，运算符是你在数学课上可能认识的符号的一个花哨的术语。Lua 中有效的运算符有：


== 等于

~=不等于

< 小于

> 大于

⇐小于或等于

>= 大于或等于


这些被称为关系运算符，因为它们比较两个值之间的关联。还有一些逻辑运算符，其含义与英语中的含义相同，可以纳入条件中，进一步描述你想检查的状态：


and

or


下面是一些条件的例子：


foo > 3：变量 foo 是否大于 3？foo 必须是 4 或更大才能满足这个条件。

foo >= 3：foo 是否大于或等于 3？foo 必须是 3 或更大才能满足这个条件。

foo > 3 and bar < 1：foo 是否大于 3 而 bar 小于 1？要满足这个条件，foo 变量必须在 bar 为 0 的同时为 4 或更大。

foo> 3 or bar < 1：foo 是否大于 3？或者，bar 是否小于 1？如果 foo 是 4 或更大，或者 bar 是 0，那么这个条件就是真的。如果 foo 是 4 或更大，而 bar 是 0，会怎样？答案出现在本文的后面。


While 循环

只要满足某个条件，while 循环就会执行指令。例如，假设你正在开发一个应用来监测正在进行的…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[在将近十年后，基于 Debian 的 Legacy OS 2023 发布了，并带来了新的应用程序。




在此之前，Legacy OS 的最后一个版本发布于 2014 年。它旨在成为一个基于 Puppy Linux 的通用轻量级发行版，具有完整的应用程序、软件包、媒体编解码器等。目的是为旧电脑提供完整的操作系统。但是，该发行版在 2014 年之后停止了发布，直到现在。

Legacy OS 2023 发布

基于 antiX 的新版 Legacy OS 2023 发布有了根本性的变化。它现在基于 Debian 的稳定分支（版本 11 “bullseye”），而不是 Puppy Linux。因此，你可以期望它更加稳定，其提供 Ice WM 作为默认窗口管理器。那些使用 IceWM 的人知道它有多快。这个版本也不例外。

除了 IceWM，Legacy OS 还预装了大量的默认应用程序。默认的文件管理器是 PCManFM，还包括 ROX 文件管理器。此外，所有 antiX 原生应用程序都也预装了，其中包括 antiX 更新程序和用户管理器。Synaptic 软件管理器以及一个单独的 CLI 包管理器也被预装在内。

图形软件包括用于高级绘图工作的 GIMP 和 Inkscape。此外，MyPaint、mtPaint、Peek 屏幕录制器、屏幕截图和 ImageMagick 库也默认安装。

如果你需要办公软件的话，Legacy OS 预装了 OnlyOffice 套件，Scribus 排版工具和 Dia 图表编辑器。



网络软件包括 Firefox ESR 浏览器、Thunderbird 邮件客户端、gFTP 客户端、Transmission 种子客户端和 NetSurf 浏览器。

如果你是一个开发者的话，Geany 和 VIM 代码编辑器是默认安装的。此外，强大的笔记应用 Cherrytree、必不可少的记事本应用 Leafpad 和白板应用 Xournal 是一些主要的应用程序，这使得它成为一个全能的、轻量级的发行版。

这些只是一些主要的应用程序，系统预装了近 100 个应用程序，而只占用了 7 GB 的磁盘空间。

这个发行版的性能真的是轻量级的，因为它并未使用 systemd，并使用了 IceWM。它在空闲状态下只使用 200 MB 的内存，这让我感到惊讶。总体而言，桌面性能非常快。



它使用 Calamares 安装程序，非常适合旧版本。但是，它现在只提供 64 位版本，但团队正在开发 32 位版本，很快就会发布。

我认为这是一个很值得一试的发行版，我们很高兴它又回来了。团队承诺将来会有定期的发布。

你可以从下面的链接下载 ISO 镜像文件。请记住，立付Live介质的默认用户 ID 是 “demo”，密码也是 “demo”。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[鬼之皮衣

《百器徒然袋》五十图，有“鬼之皮衣”，讲的是狐狸化为美女的故事，而其缘由则取自中国。此图大意是，寿过三千年的狐狸，身披藻草之衣，头顶骷髅，以拜北斗，骷髅如果不掉下来，则可化为美女。
据说事出自唐代段成式的笔记《酉阳杂俎》。现检其书卷十五《诺皋记下》有如下文：“旧说野狐名紫狐，夜击尾火出。将为怪，必戴髑髅拜北斗，髑髅不坠，则化为人矣。”
显然《百器徒然袋》对原文做了一些改动，《诺皋记下》中并没有“藻草”一类的字眼。如果不是藻草在日本有什么特殊的魔法，那么估计这“藻”是指华美的衣服。因为狐狸化为美女不可能没有衣服，所以要提前披上一件漂亮的衣服，而藻则有华美的意思。
这只是一个中国的传说，并没有成为日本的妖怪，所以水木茂就没有收入到他的《妖怪大全》中。

图中的文字是：“《白泽避怪图》曰：饭甑作声鬼，名敛女。有此怪，则呼鬼名，其怪忽自灭。于梦中思及此。”
《白泽避怪图》应该就是中国的《白泽图》，因为其中多有见某怪则“以其名呼之”，其怪则去，或灭，或有其他异征。也就是说知道此怪之名，则可使其避人，所以也可以叫《白泽避怪图》，但中国古书中似未见过这种书名。
《白泽图》一书不知哪个朝代就佚失了，我们现在所能见到的都是唐《法苑珠林》、宋《太平御览》等书中所引，另外就是敦煌写卷《白泽精怪图》。但以上几种书都没有这么一个名叫“敛女”的“饭甑作声鬼”。可是明末人徐应秋《玉芝堂谈荟》卷十三有一段：“釜甑鬼，名婆女。凡遇釜鸣，呼其名，不为灾。”这一段文例正合《白泽图》，而后接着的文字也是取自《白泽图》，所以鸟山所写的一段应该没什么问题，只是文字略有差异，意思是大致不错的。两种文字比较，我觉得《谈荟》较近真，作声的是“釜甑”，其鬼名“婆女”。
如果我们现在做饭用的敞口的大铁锅突然叫起来，那实在是不可思议，但“釜”则不然，它实际上就是去掉三个爪的“鬲”，看上去就和罐子差不多，肚大口小…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Firefox 110 现在可以下载了，带来了以下新功能。


上周发布的 Firefox 110 是今年的第二个版本，现在可以通过官方发布渠道下载和升级。

这个月度版本是在 Firefox 109 版本之后发布的，后者是在 1 月份发布的。

总的来说，新的功能和错误修复很少，特别是对 Linux 来说。下面是一个快速点评。



Firefox 110 的最佳新功能

对于 Windows 用户来说，这个版本有一些好消息。期待已久的安全功能 “GPU 沙盒” 现在在 Windows 中的 Firefox 中可用。从理论上讲，沙盒可以隔离一个进程，使其他恶意程序无法攻击或访问系统中的其他进程。有了这个功能，GPU 进程会被隔离，在 Windows 中可以给你一个更安全的浏览体验。

你可以使用以下步骤检查沙盒功能。


从地址栏打开 about:support。

在页面底部搜索（CTRL+F）“sandbox”。

并验证设置。


不知道这项功能何时会到达 Linux 或 macOS。

除上述内容外，现在还可以从 Opera 和 Vivaldi 网络浏览器中导入书签、浏览历史和密码。这使那些想迁移到 Firefox 的人更加方便。

此外，Firefox 浏览器现在启用了阻止第三方模块注入 Firefox 浏览器的选项。企业级大规模的 Firefox 浏览器部署得到了一个与上述阻止相一致的新策略，名为 DisableThirdPartyModuleBlocking。然而，它在 Firefox ESR 部署中不可用。

在 macOS、Linux 和 Windows 中进行了一些可用性改进，在按下 CTRL + backspace/delete或 Cmd + backspace 时，可以清除本地化的日期时间字段。除此之外，Firefox 现在在 Windows 的非英特尔 GPU 中叠加了硬件解码的视频，改善了视频播放性能和缩放质量。

这些是主要的变化，除了开发者特定的 CSS、HTML 更新，你可以在更新日志页面找到更多变化的说明（见下文）。

下载和更新

对于 Linux 发行版，如果你通过你的发行版的官方仓库使用 Firefox，那么你应该在几天内得到这个更新。

然而，你也可以从下面的页面下载这个版本的压缩版本。对于其他下载选项，请访问我们的 Firefox 浏览器下载指南。


下载 Firefox 浏览器110


祝你浏览愉快！

        <id>https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34929968</id>
        <link href="https://thapen.itch.io/painted-ocean"/>
        <updated>2023-02-24T20:52:14.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This is a simulator of a frigate from about 1800. It has realistic physics, tuned to match historical performance. The UI is based around commands given in period naval language. Rather than use the current weather, it has a full year's weather data (for 1980 - taken from https://psl.noaa.gov/data/gridded/data.ncep.reanalysis2.html). This allows the weather to change realistically under time acceleration.
To learn the basics of handling a square-rigged ship, start the "Harbour" scenario, click on the instructions button at the bottom left, and follow the instructions to try to get out of Portsmouth harbour.
To go for a long sail, start the "The World" scenario. Open the map, control+click anywhere on it to move there; control+click on the compass at the bottom left to turn the ship to that heading; then activate travel acceleration at the bottom right.
It's a simulator more than a game - think MS flight simulator. There's no sinking, but you can lose sails or spars in high winds. It's windows only.
This was released a couple of years ago, but this is an updated version from the end of January. See the devlog (https://thapen.itch.io/painted-ocean/devlog) for the changes. You can also find some discussions there on historical sailing performance numbers.

 "Auto Tab Discard" web extension suspends unused tabs. (Also, cuts down on memory usage)
 Disable a Neovim plugin that takes +5% CPU (marks.nvim)
 Dim display
 Kill a dashboard I usually have running on a spare monitor
 Open a blank tab in every browser window. I also had to configure new tabs to open to blank page.
  
This is specific to me. What you would do will depend on what software you use.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Developers who build distributions often (but not always) put considerable
effort into backward compatibility, ensuring, for example, that a program
built for one release will continue to run on later releases.  Forward
compatibility, where it is possible to move a program (or other artifact)
from a more recent release to an older one, can be less of a concern, but
it still tends to be seen as something that is better to not break if
possible.  So it is not surprising that an issue affecting the
forward-compatibility of ext4 filesystems built for the upcoming
Debian 12 ("bookworm") release has generated a fair amount of
discussion, even if the number of affected users is likely to be small.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[由于对敏感数据暴露越来越感到紧张，华尔街开始限制员工使用ChatGPT。据媒体最新报道，摩根大通已限制其员工使用ChatGPT聊天机器人。此前拥有70多万员工的科技咨询公司埃森哲也警告员工不要将客户信息暴露给ChatGPT等聊天工具。


近几个月来，ChatGPT成为了一种互联网现象级焦点，从莎士比亚风格的诗歌创作到创建股票投资组合，它的未来潜力引发了人们的热议。有分析认为，ChatGPT将对多个行业产生影响，华尔街似乎也不能例外，从财务规划到股票交易，ChatGPT将从多个方面影响华尔街。


一些公司已经开始尝试使用这类工具来提高工作效率。然而，数据安全和法律专家表示担心，与聊天机器人共享的信息可能会被用于微调它们的算法，或者可能被付费检查其答案的外包工人访问。


受到严格监管的银行和金融机构纷纷在员工使用这项新技术时设置了护栏。分析称，银行和金融机构对引进任何新技术的谨慎态度都是可以理解的。在2021年和2022年期间，美国监管机构向12家银行发放了总计超过20亿美元的罚单，原因是它们的员工未经授权使用私人短信服务。


还有人担心聊天机器人的准确性。虽然聊天机器人被设计成能写出类似人类的句子，但它们很难区分事实和错误信息。它们也可以被哄骗提供看似精神错乱的答案，比如威胁测试这项服务的人类，或者出现完全荒谬的回答。微软的搜索聊天机器人Bing就在其官方发布活动中被发现提供了完全不准确的答案，而微软团队却没有发现，例如在被要求总结财务收益新闻稿时编造数字。


据媒体报道，上个月，出于隐私考虑，亚马逊警告员工不要与聊天机器人分享机密信息。亚马逊的一名律师警告员工:“我们不希望它的输出包含类似我们的机密信息(我已经看到它的输出与现有材料非常相近的例子)。”安全专家敦促在向人工智能聊天机器人提供数据时要谨慎。


与大型银行和金融机构合作监控内部安全风险的技术公司Behavox的发言人表示：“在过去一个月里，客户对ChatGPT的使用提出的担忧呈上升趋势，特别是在涉及使用私人或专有数据时。”


律师事务所Mishcon de Reya的数据保护专家Jon Baines表示，还有人质疑，如果该软件大量提供不准确的信息，使用ChatGPT的公司是否有违反数据法的风险。


Baines表示：


“如果机器人的输出涉及个人数据处理，那么问题就来了，这种不可避免的不准确处理在多大程度上可能违反了《通用数据保护条例》(GDPR)要求准确处理个人数据的规定。”

1690年12月，皮埃尔·贝尔（Pierre Bayle，1647-1706）萌生了编写一部辞典的想法，在写给表兄弟的信中，他说：
我想编一本批判式辞典，其中将收集那些编写词典的人和其他作家所犯的错误，并在每个人或城市的名字下减少有关该人或城市的错误。这是一个庞大的计划，很耗时，需要有思想的人提供意见和建议，而且我不想在没有与公众交流任何计划和成果之前，就贸然动手。所以，我很快就把《前言》（Avant-Coureur）的前几篇词条印出来，与公众交流。（Pierre Bayle, Nouvelles Lettres, Tome II, La Havie: chez Jean Van Duren, 1739, p. 297。注：贝尔的所有通信都可以在网站http://bayle-correspondance.univ-st-etienne.fr/查询检索）
两年后，贝尔出版了一本四百多页，八开本的书，题为《批判辞典的草案与节录》（Projet et fragmens d’un dictionnaire critique，下文简称《草案与节录》）。事实上这不是一部独立的作品，而是为计划编写的辞典做的“广告”，目的是试探市场的反响。当时，出版业风险很大，经验丰富的作者往往会在正式作品出版之前，通过不同方式，或向不同的出版商同时透露出版计划，或是像贝尔那样打出“广告”，试探读者反映，激发订阅者兴趣，为将来的出版筹集足够多的资金。
在《草案与节录》中，贝尔透露了他编纂新辞典是为了修正之前辞典存在的各类错误。他认为，这就是“批评家”（Mrs les critiques）的任务：
为人类的弱点提供如此之多的证据，因此可以为他们的各种谬论编写几卷书。这几卷书可以在人的最大的虚荣心方面，也就是科学方面，让人感到羞愧。如此之多的战利…]]></summary>

二十多年来，德国电信、Orange、Telefonica、意大利电信和其他运营商一直在游说领先的技术公司为 5G 和宽带的推出做出贡献。他们认为，这些大型科技公司占到了数据互联网流量的一半以上。欧盟委员会周四启动了关于欧洲电信业未来的咨询，开始了一个可能导致要求这些大型科技公司支付一些网络费用的过程。科技公司们反对这一看法，称这是一种互联网税。

老王点评：电信公司越来越对只是一个管道服务商感到不满，但是如果科技公司连网络基础设施都建设了的话，还要电信公司干啥？




Linux 欧洲基金会推出 OpenWallet 基金会

Linux 基金会不久前成立的 “Linux 欧洲基金会Linux Foundation Europe” 发起了 OpenWallet 基金会（OWF）。虽然像贝宝、谷歌、苹果、阿里、腾讯等最知名的数字钱包供应商，允许消费者在商店或网上进行金融交易，但数字钱包正越来越多地被用来存储从学生证到驾驶执照的各种虚拟商品。但现有的这些数字钱包，在大多数情况下，都不能很好地相互配合。这就是为什么 OWF 要创建一个 “开源引擎”，以支持可互操作的数字钱包。


消息来源：Tech Crunch



老王点评：确实，钱包之间不应该是一个个孤岛。但是这个应该不是技术问题，而是利益问题。OWF 推出一个互操作规范，应该是打破孤岛的第一步。




谷歌 Play 商店中大多数顶级应用的数据隐私标签都是虚假或误导的

Mozilla 研究人员发现，在对谷歌 Play 商店中的一些应用程序经过过审查后，近 80% 的应用程序的数据安全标签和其隐私政策之间存在差异。Play 商店中数据安全标签会让你相信，TikTok 和 Twitter 都不会与第三方分享你的个人数据。然而，这些应用程序的隐私政策都明确指出，它们与广告商、互联网服务提供商、平台和许多其他类型的公司分享用户信息。谷歌发表声明称，该研究“混淆了公司范围内的隐私政策……以及个别的数据安全标签”。


消息来源：Slashdot



老王点评：应用的数据隐私标签是主动声明的，如果不能从技术上防范和监督，那其实很难确保。]]></summary>

 Now, these are niche-within-niche pieces of software. Most people don't run Linux and most Linux systems use stock distro kernels. They won't be targeted as much as popular server installs or outlook. Still, we've seen lots of supply chain attacks in the silliest of places lately, niche npm, python etc. packages have been targeted rather massively (both directly and with namedupes), and people trying (and succeeding) to backdoor linux distros and kernels is not unheard of either.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Planby 是一个 JavaScript 组件，用于帮助创建流媒体服务、音乐和体育赛事等的时间表、时间线和电子节目指南（EPG）。


几年来，我在电视在线和视频点播（VOD）行业工作。在开发一个调度器网络应用时，我意识到在电子节目指南（EPG）和调度方面没有好的解决方案。诚然，对于大多数网络开发者来说，这是一个小众的功能，但对于电视应用来说，这是一个常见的需求。我看到并分析了许多网站实现了他们自己的 EPG 或时间表，我经常想，为什么每个人似乎都在发明他们自己的解决方案，而不是致力于开发一个大家都能使用的共享解决方案。这就是我开始开发 Planby 的时候。

Planby 是一个 React（JavaScript）组件，帮助你为在线电视和视频点播（VOD）服务、音乐和体育赛事等创建计划、时间线和电子节目指南（EPG）。Planby 使用自定义的虚拟视图，允许你对大量的数据进行操作，并以友好和有用的方式呈现给你的观众。

Planby 有一个简单的 API，你可以与第三方 UI 库集成。组件的主题是根据应用设计的需要定制的。

时间线性能

实现时间线功能时，最重要的是性能。你有可能在许多不同频道处理无穷无尽的数据流。应用可能不断地在刷新、移动和滚动。你希望用户与内容的互动是流畅的。

还有一个潜在的问题是设计不当。有时，一个应用以列表的形式实现 EPG 时间线，你必须垂直滚动，这意味着你必须点击按钮在时间上左右移动，这很快就会变得很累。更重要的是，有时与 EPG 互动的自定义功能（如评级、选择你最喜欢的频道、从右到左（RTL）阅读等）根本无法使用，或者即便它们可用，也会导致性能问题。

我经常面临的另一个问题是，应用的数据传输过于冗长。当一个应用在你滚动浏览 EPG 的时候请求数据，时间线会感觉很慢，甚至会崩溃。

什么是 Planby？

这就是 Planby 的作用。Planby 是从头开始建立的，使用 React 和 Typescript 以及少量的资源。它使用一个自定义的虚拟视图，允许你对大量的数据进行操作。它向用户显示节目和频道，并根据时间和指定频道自动定位所有元素。当一个资源不包含任何内容时，Planby 会计算定位，使时间段正确对齐。

Planby 有一个简单的界面，包括所有必要的功能，如侧边栏、时间轴本身、愉快的布局和实时节目刷新。此外，还有一个可选的功能，允许你隐藏任何你不想包括在布局中的元素。

Planby 有一个简单的 API，允许你作为开发者实现你自己的项目以及用户的偏好。你可以使用 Planby 的主题来开发新的功能，也可以制作自定义的样式来配合你选择的设计。你可以很容易地整合其他功能，如日历、评级选项、用户最喜欢的列表、滚动、“现在” 按钮、录制计划、追播内容等等。更重要的是，你可以添加自定义的全局样式，包括 RTL 功能。

最重要的是，它在 MIT 许可下开源。

尝试 Planby

如果你想尝试一下 Planby，或者只是想了解一下它，请访问 Git 仓库。在那里，我已经有了一些例子，你可以阅读文档了解详情。该软件包也可以通过 npm 获得。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ubuntu 各特色版已同意停止使用 Flatpak 作为其操作系统的默认打包系统，而选择替代的打包管理器。


这是一个令人惊讶的举动，Canonical 宣布，所有官方的 Ubuntu 特色版将不会默认支持 Flatpak。这个决定是在与所有官方 Ubuntu 特色版的团队/维护者达成一致后做出的。这一变化计划从 2023 年 4 月发布的 “Lunar Lobster” 开始，该版本将在几周后发布。

Ubuntu 官方特色版将停止默认安装 Flatpak

基于 Ubuntu 的官方特色版（Kubuntu、Lubuntu、Xubuntu 等）将不再将 Flatpak 作为其默认的打包解决方案，而选择其他方案，如 Snap 和本地 deb 格式。这样做是为了 “在尊重现有用户个性化他们自己的体验方式的同时，改善新用户开箱即用的 Ubuntu 体验”。

虽然这个决定得到了 Canonical 的支持，为了提供更好的用户体验，阻止软件包生态系统的碎片化，并给用户一个稳定的应用产品的选择。但显然，有几个问题冒了出来。

为什么是现在？Flatpak 和 Snap 都已经存在多年了。Flatpak 正变得越来越流行，它作为一种包格式在积极开发和维护，一些现代功化的功能也正在开发中，比如即将出现的 “经过验证的应用程序”。而同时，由于 Snap 的 “启动时间慢”，以及被 Canonical 的封闭服务器所控制等其他原因，它在桌面应用部署领域无法得到很大普及。

Ubuntu 发行版本身从来没有默认提供过 Flatpak。但是特色版的维护者应该有选择自己的产品的自由，并在 Ubuntu 基础上进行创新。这也是成为一个特色版的主要原因，而不只是一个不同的桌面环境。

给用户造成的困难

虽然你总是可以手动安装 Flatpak 并配置 Flathub，但显然，这可能会给用户带来一些问题。我相信这个公告是彻底阻止 Flatpak 安装方式的第一步。

还记得 Firefox Snap 的情况吗？要删除 Firefox Snap，你必须做复杂的命令行操作，才能安装 deb 版本。这些对于普通的 Ubuntu 用户来说是非常复杂的。此外，一些流行的桌面应用程序在发布后会立即推出 Flatpak 软件包。对于许多流行的 Linux 桌面应用程序来说，有时甚至没有提供 Snap 软件包。

我相信让用户来决定哪种打包格式是容易和遵循的。Canonical 应该通过解决 Snap 的核心问题、应用程序的可用性和闭门造车的性质来自行改进 Snap，而不是强行做出决定。此外，在为一个社区贡献的发行版推送决定之前，应该与特色版维护者一起发起投票，以获得来自社区的反馈。

结束语

如果我们曾经从历史中吸取教训的话，它永远不会以好的方式结束。也就是说，这一变化将从 2023 年 4 月 23 日 Ubuntu 23.04 “Lunar Lobster” 发布时开始。

让我用 Ubuntu 的座右铭来结束这篇文章，在这一举措之后，这听起来很奇怪：


“Ubuntu 是一个古老的非洲语单词，意思是‘以人道善待他人Humanity to Others’。它经常被描述为提醒我们，‘群在故我在’。我们把 Ubuntu 的精神带到了计算机和软件的世界里。Ubuntu 发行版代表了世界软件社区与世界分享的最好的东西。”

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm thinking about software documentation, including tutorials. Let's say a piece of software is used in several places, then a change happens to it. Is there a way to link or connect the the downstream software to the upstream one so that when a potentially software-breaking change happens upstream, an annotation or a comment or a notification is sent warning of the change? 
 Here are two completely hypothetical examples, I'm just using my imagination here. Rust is used to write a part of a new Linux kernel, after finishing the Rust code, it is uploaded into a change management system that adds metadata to all the Rust language features used. Later on, Mozilla for some reason changed something about the language, this change is then inputted into a system that sends a warning notification about the changed features. Our change management system picks up that the change is relevant to our kernel code. Now a maintainer of the kernel can look and see what version of Rust downstream changed what features in so and so lines of the kernel code. 
 Another example, Python is used to make a scientific desktop app, with the app itself enabling the use of python. A scientist uses the app and writes code for a specific application then makes a youtube tutorial explaining the code. He then uploads the code and the video to our change management system. A few years later, a new python version comes out that changes features relevant to our scientist, so he receives warning notifications at specific locations in his code as well specific minutes:seconds of his youtube video where those features were discussed. 
 Do you think something like this could be of value? Does something like this exists?

foreshadowing what it plans to propose:


	A main driver of the keywords generics initiative has been our

	were thinking about introducing keyword-traits at the same time,

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[北京时间2月23日早间消息，据报道，美国版权局在一封信件中表示，AI绘画工具Midjourney制作的图片不受版权保护。美国版权局称，艺术家克里斯蒂娜·卡什塔诺娃(Kristina Kashtanova）写了一本名为《Zarya of the Dawn》的漫画书，虽然书的内容受版权保护，但她用Midjourney制作的AI图片不受保护。


在最近生成式AI大红大紫，Midjourney、Dall-E和ChatGPT受到追捧，美国版权局的表态值得重视。


卡什塔诺娃为作品提交了著作权登记申请，美国版权局批准了申请并登记，但现在版权局决定重新登记，登记时剔除非人类作者创作的图片。卡什塔诺娃认为拿到故事和图片编排版权是一个好消息，不过她和代表律师会坚守自己的信念，她们认为AI图片表达了作者的创意，应该获得版权保护。


Midjourney一款比较流行的AI工具，作者给出文本提示，AI就会创作出图片。去年10月美国版权局曾告诉卡什塔诺娃，将重新考虑书本的版权登记问题，因为卡什塔诺娃在申请时没有提及Midjourney扮演的角色。


美国版权局在最新信件中指出，书中的文本和元素编排受到版权保护，至于书中图片，卡什塔诺娃并非策划者。信中解释称：“事实上Midjourney的具体输出结果是用户无法预测的，从版权的角度看，与艺术家使用其它工具比较，Midjourney有明显不同。”

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[美国版权局撤销了 AI 生成的图像的版权

之前，我们 报道（#770） 过一本名为《黎明的扎丽亚》的使用 AI 创作的漫画书获得了美国版权注册。但美国版权局在周二发出的一份信中说，该书作者有权为她撰写和编排的书籍部分获得版权，但不包括她使用 Midjourney 制作的图像。这是美国法院或机构首次就用人工智能创作的作品的版权保护范围作出的决定之一。美国版权局将重新签发 《黎明的扎利亚》 的注册，以忽略那些 “不是人类创作的产物” 的图像。


消息来源：路透社



老王点评：漫画书失去了图像版权还剩下什么？确实，AI 创作的图像、文字，版权如何确定是一个新的复杂问题，需要研究。




苹果公司努力将免刺血糖监测带入苹果手表

这个项目据说已经开发了很长时间，始于 2010 年，当时生病的乔布斯收购了一家血糖监测初创公司。该项目现在处于 “概念验证阶段”，剩下的最后一个障碍是要把它做得更小。该技术使用激光来测量皮肤下的葡萄糖浓度，以前该设备有桌面大小，但据说已经发展到了 iPhone 大小的可穿戴原型的地步。据称该技术不仅能用于监测，还可以提醒前期患者。


消息来源：Engadget



老王点评：即便是不差钱的大公司，真正做出突破也非常困难。但是这才是大公司存在的意义，而不是卖菜。




ChatGPT 式搜索比传统搜索的成本大 10 倍不止

ChatGPT 式的搜索引擎将涉及到每次你运行搜索时启动一个巨大的以人脑为模型的神经网络，产生大量的文本，并且可能还查询搜索索引以获取事实信息。所有这些额外的处理都将花费更多的钱。Alphabet 的董事长说，ChatGPT 式的搜索“成本可能是标准关键词搜索的 10 倍”。而摩根士丹利估计“类似 ChatGPT 的人工智能以 50 个字的答案来处理它收到的一半查询，那么谷歌每年的成本将增加 60 亿美元。”


消息来源：Ars Technica



老王点评：值得注意是的，微软必应的市场份额只有 3%，而谷歌有 93%，那么对于微软来说可以接受的成本增加，对于谷歌来说可能就是比较大的问题了。]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[BitTorrent 客户端 Transmission 4.0 版本已经发布，带来了急需的功能升级和改进。




BitTorrent 是一种流行的 HTTP 的替代方式，用于在互联网上分享或下载文件。你可能知道，有许多各具特色的 BitTorrent 客户端。

Transmission 就是这样一个开源的、轻量级的 BitTorrent 客户端。

该应用程序的上一个稳定版本是近两年前发布的。虽然在此期间没有看到新的版本，但该项目仍在积极开发中。

Transmission 4.0 有什么新内容？

新版本带来了大量的新功能和改进。这包括 IPv6 封锁、BitTorrent v2支持、改版的网络客户端等等。

以下是一些重要的亮点：

对 BitTorrent v2 和混合 Torrent 的支持

BitTorrent v2 是现有 BitTorrent 协议的更新版本，带来了一些有用的技术进步。

另一方面，混合 Torrent 确保了与旧版 BitTorrent v1 的向后兼容性。

请注意，这个版本只能让你使用 v2 和混合 Torrent。而要创建 v2 和混合 Torrent ，你需要等待下一个版本。

默认跟踪器的使用

用户现在应该发现，通过设置默认的跟踪器，可以更容易地公布或请求公开的 Torrent。

IPv6 封锁列表

现在包括对 IPv6 封锁的支持。

如果你遇到网络问题而想默认使用 IPv4，这很有用。

在某些情况下，VPN 用户可能也喜欢这个功能，因为许多 VPN 服务器可能不能很好地支持 IPv6，这可能导致数据泄露。

新的隐私友好功能

用户有时喜欢在创建 Torrent 时不包括用户身份或相关信息。

有一个新的选项正是为了这个目的而添加的，它排除了这些细节信息。

🛠️其他变化和改进

除了上面列出的变化外，考虑到他们已经开发了一年多，还有大量的改进！

其中一些值得注意的改进包括：


更好的资源利用。

将代码从 C 语言迁移到 C++ 语言。

在创建新 Torrent 时能够指定片断大小。

支持 Qt 6。

基于 GTKMM 的 GTK 客户端。

更好的网络客户端用户界面，包括对移动屏幕的支持。

支持 macOS 苹果芯片。


你可以前往其 GitHub 发布区 了解完整的发布说明。

下载 Transmission 4.0

官方资源库和 Flathub 还没有最新的版本可用。

因此，你必须从其 官方下载页面 或 GitHub 发布部分 下载并解压 tar.xz 文件。

然后，从源码构建它以获得安装。


Transmission 4.0


你可以在同一页上找到其他平台的软件包。

我的 Tcl 之旅始于最近需要将一个困难的基于 Java 的命令行配置工具自动化。我使用 Ansible 做了一些自动化编程，偶尔也会使用 expect 模块。坦率地说，我发现这个模块的作用有限，原因包括：难以对相同的提示进行排序，难以捕捉到额外步骤的值，控制逻辑的灵活性有限，等等。有时你可以用 shell 模块来代替。但有时你会遇到那种特立独行、过于复杂的命令行程序，似乎无法实现自动化。

就我而言，我正在自动安装我公司的一个程序。最后的配置步骤只能通过命令行来完成，通过几个不规范的、重复的提示和需要捕捉的数据输出。好在传统的 Expect 是唯一的答案。要使用 Expect 的基本功能，并不需要对 Tcl 有很深的了解，但你了解的越多，你就能从它那里得到更多的力量。这是后续文章的话题。现在，我探讨一下 Tcl 的基本语言结构，包括用户输入、输出、变量、条件判断、循环和简单函数。

安装 Tcl

在 Linux 系统上，我使用这个：

# dnf install tcl
# which tclsh
/bin/tclsh


在 macOS 上，你可以使用 Homebrew 来安装最新的 Tcl：

$ brew install tcl-tk
$ which tclsh
/usr/local/bin/tclsh


在 Tcl 中猜数字

从创建基本的可执行脚本 numgame.tcl 开始：

$ touch numgame.tcl
$ chmod 755 numgame.tcl


接着在你的文件中开始编码，标题是通常的 #!：

#!/usr/bin/tclsh


这里有一些关于 Tcl 的简单介绍，以便与本文一起追踪。

美国作家安妮·法迪曼（Anne Fadiman）的《要命还是要灵魂：医病冲突中的跨文化误解》（The Spirit Catches You and You Fall Down: A Hmong Child， Her American Doctors， and the Collision of Two Cultures，1997；汤丽明、刘建台、杨佳蓉译，上海三联书店，2022年12月）讲述的是1980年代发生在美国加州默塞德（Merced）县的州立医院与一个美国苗族病人家庭之间的医患误会乃至冲突的故事，故事中的双方无疑都受到伤害，但是都不知道原因是什么，也不知道如何避免下一次的误会与冲突。法迪曼出身于纽约的一个文学家庭，在哈佛大学毕业后从事野外探险工作，既不是医疗专家也不是人类学家，她自言刚来到这里的时候对美国的医疗文化只有浅薄的认识，对苗族文化则是一无所知。她只是一个敏锐的观察者、聆听者和记录者，这个故事原来准备写给报刊，后来因故没能发表，于是就有了这本书。
关于观察者，法迪曼认为最值得观察的活动并非发生在中心，而是在交界的边缘，因为在这些地方总能看到耐人寻味的摩擦与矛盾，更能看清楚双方；尤其当你站在两种文化中间，更是如此。（序，第2页）作为文化边界上的观察者，她以朴素、生动的语言讲述了这个故事，却没想到这个故事不但推动了美国医疗体系中的跨文化改革，还进入了大学医疗教育的跨文化教学课堂。这本书的书名同样很朴素、生动，直译过来的原意是“灵魂抓住你，你倒下：一个苗族孩子，她的美国医生，两种文化的碰撞”。其实这个“灵魂”指的是“恶灵”，作者在书中谈到，苗语中的“qaug dab peg”意思是“恶灵抓住你，你就倒下…]]></summary>

好吧，我们来聊聊《毫无意义》。这取决于你有多少时间，以及对伍迪·艾伦——这位从第一部电影《傻瓜入狱记》时起外貌就几乎保持不变的小老头儿有多少爱与热情（或憎恶）。一个简单的版本——或许ChatGPT也会这么告诉你——这本书的主题是：人类在一个毫无意义的、残暴的宇宙中寻找上帝（至少第53页上是这么写的）。如果你是五条人的歌迷，特别喜欢那首《陈先生》，那不如这么说：他出生在1935年11月30日，他继续活在他的公寓里。如果你要求我稍微展开讲讲，那就这样：他有三次差点没能出生，出生后先后热爱魔术、电影、单口喜剧、爵士乐和女人，拍了很多电影……如果你想从书中得到一些养生建议：“我可以把生命看成悲剧或喜剧，这取决于我的血糖水平……”如果你是《上海书评》的零零后年轻读者，伍迪·艾伦对你来说是崭新的，想知道最好从哪几部电影开始看起，伍迪的推荐是：《丈夫、太太与情人》《开罗紫玫瑰》《子弹横飞百老汇》是“我最好的电影之一”；《赛末点》则是“少数几部超越我的雄心的电影之一”。如果你觉得不够好看或好笑，伍迪也不会在意，“赞扬毫无意义。即使得到很高的赞誉，你还是会得关节炎和带状疱疹”。如果你觉得这一切太虚无，想要摄取一些低脂零糖的正能量，听听他给青年电影人的建议吧：“一刻不停地苦干。不要抬头。工作。享受工作。不要去读什么《毫无意义的工作》。”好吧，最后一句是我编的，大卫·格雷伯别骂我。如果你是菲利普·罗斯的书迷，特别喜欢《波特诺伊的怨诉》，想知道伍迪·艾伦会怎样将之搬上大银幕，他会机智地说，“用手持摄像机”。如果你想让伍迪教你如何从《战争与和平》一样长的酒单上选酒：“把眼光投向正确位置，使你看起来像在看酒单上的年份，实际上是在查看价格。坚持选择你能负担得起的最贵的那种…]]></summary>

work is now being presented as a
draft document describing how that model will work.


	This RFC establishes a Leadership Council as the successor of the
	core team and the new governance structure through which Rust
	Project members collectively confer the authority to ensure
	successful operation of the Project. The Leadership Council
	delegates much of this authority to teams (which includes subteams,
	working groups, etc.) who autonomously make decisions concerning
	their purviews. However, the Council retains some decision-making
	authority, outlined and delimited by this RFC.]]></summary>

Upwork, out of the blue, suspended my account, oh, and my payments are lost like tears in the rain.
This past Friday Upwork informed me that the were some "account overlapings" with an specific client, I provided Id's, answered questions, even provided long ass screens recordings of the conversations with this client, so they could check how much of a boring illustator I am.
Still they've decided that I was doing something shady and suspended my account with no further explanation ):
I guess I'm posting this to get it off my chest, but also to warn others as to how capricious and arbitrary these platforms can be.

fragmented and complex, though users of the language have been clamoring
for some kind of 
unification for a decade or more at this point.  The developers behind
pip and other packaging tools would like to find a way to satisfy
this wish from
Python-language users and developers, thus they have been discussing possible

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey everyone, I wanted to share a new tool we've created called Jotte (https://jotte.ai) which we believe can be a game-changer for AI-generated longform writing like novels and research papers.
As you may know, current AI like ChatGPT and GPT-3 have a token limit of around 4000 tokens or 3000 words, which limits their effectiveness for longer writing tasks. With Jotte, we've developed a graph-based approach to summarize information and effectively give AI "unlimited" memory.
Jotte remembers recent details like the meal a character ate a page ago, while avoiding getting bogged down by irrelevant details like the blue curtains mentioned 5 chapters ago. We've created a proof of concept and would love to hear your thoughts on it.
Do you think this approach could lead to better longform writing by AI? Let us know in the comments!

We run fully managed Intel and Arm builders in AWS, accessible directly from CI and from your terminal.
Building Docker images in CI today is slow. CI runners are ephemeral, so they must save and load the cache for every build. They have constrained resources, with limited CPUs, memory, and disk space. And they do not support native Arm or multi-platform container builds, and instead require emulation.
Over 4 years of working together, we spent countless hours optimizing and reoptimizing Dockerfiles, managing layer caching in CI, and maintaining custom runners for multi-platform images. We were working around the li…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[ChatGPT火爆全球，各大科技公司纷纷加码人工智能。不过聊天机器人工具这一新兴技术不仅在准确性方面存在问题，还使得研发公司背负高昂的运营成本。当地时间2月22日，谷歌母公司Alphabet的董事长约翰·亨尼斯（John Hennessy）在路透社的采访中表示，大型语言模型等人工智能的对话成本可能是传统搜索引擎的10倍以上。他认为谷歌必须降低此类人工智能的运营成本，但这一过程并不容易，“最坏的情况是需要几年时间。”


聊天机器人成本高昂


与传统搜索引擎相比，聊天机器人的运营成本略显高昂。


摩根士丹利的分析表示，谷歌去年共计3.3万亿次搜索，每次搜索的成本仅为0.2美分。而此前有分析师指出，ChatGPT的一次回复则会产生2美分的成本。


摩根士丹利预计，若将谷歌旗下聊天机器人Bard引入搜索引擎，并用其处理谷歌一半的搜索和提问，按照每次答案50词计算，该公司2024年的成本可能会增加60亿美元。


同样的，专注于芯片技术的咨询公司SemiAnalysis表示，受到谷歌的内部芯片Tensor Processing Units等的影响，将聊天机器人添加至搜索引擎中，可能会导致该公司额外花费30亿美元。


搜索引擎You.com的首席执行官Richard Socher则认为，添加聊天机器人、图表、视频及其他生成技术应用程序，将对应30%至50%的额外支出。不过他认为，“随着时间的推移，这类技术会变得越来越便宜。”


聊天机器人的成本之所以高于传统搜索，主要是因为其所需的算力（computing power）更大。分析师称，此类人工智能依赖于价值数十亿美元的芯片，将这项成本平摊到几年的使用期中，单次使用成本会增加。此外电力消耗同样会导致成本提高，还会为公司带来碳排放指标方面的压力。


聊天机器人式的人工智能与搜索引擎的工作原理并不相同。人工智能处理用户问题的过程被称为“推理（inference）”，它模拟人脑的“神经网络”，根据此前的训练数据推断出答案。而传统搜索引擎中，谷歌的网络爬虫会扫描互联网并编制为信息索引。当用户输入搜索问题时，谷歌会提供存储在索引中最相关的答案。


对于聊天机器人而言，其所依赖的语言模型规模越大，需要越多的芯片支持“推理”，对应的成本就更高昂。


以ChatGPT为例， 其技术来源是OpenAI旗下自然语言处理（NLP）模型GPT-3，该模型拥有1750亿参数，训练成本花费约1200万美元，是同类中参数数量最多、最昂贵的模型之一。


因此ChatGPT的成本居高不下。OpenAI的首席执行官萨姆·奥特曼（Sam Altman）曾在推特上表示，ChatGPT与用户对话的成本非常“惊人”，每次对话需要花费几美分或更多。


有媒体根据微软对单个100 AGPU的收费情况进行推断，得出ChatGPT生成一个单词的费用约为0.0003美元，若以每次回复50词来计算，ChatGPT的一次回复需消耗1.5美分。


对此，亨尼斯表示，“你必须降低推理成本，最坏的情况需要几年时间（解决这一问题）。”


科技公司设法降低成本


尽管聊天机器人为公司带来额外花销，但它同时也会带来用户增长。


微软此前表示，新版必应推出的48小时内，超过100万用户注册新版必应。第三方数据公司data.ai的分析显示，必应应用程序的全球下载量在一夜之间猛增10倍，并蹿升到苹果App Store应用商店最受欢迎的免费应用榜中的第十位。


微软的首席财务官艾米·胡德（Amy Hood）也告诉分析师，随着新版必应上线，用户数量增加及广告收入带来的好处已经超过了成本。她认为公司的毛利率其实处于增长状态。


但也有人提出公司需要采取措施降低成本。一位资深技术高管在路透社的采访中表示，要使几百万消费者使用人工智能，目前成本仍然过高。该高管表示，“这些模型非常昂贵，因此下一阶段的重点是降低这些模型的训练和推理的成本，以便用户能够在每个应用程序中使用它们。”


有技术专家认为，降低成本的方法之一是使用较小的人工智能模型，并将其应用于更简单的任务。


Alphabet目前正在探索这条道路。其聊天机器人Bard基于公司旗下大型对话语言模型LaMDA的轻量化版本。相比标准版本，轻量化版本模型所需要的运算能力较小，能面向更多使用者开放，使其参与体验。


也有知情人士透露，OpenAI的计算机科学家已经找到如何通过复杂代码优化推理成本的方法，并以此提高芯片运行效率。


除了降低成本，该公司还通过收取费用获得营收。2月初，OpenAI宣布推出付费版ChatGPT Plus，定价每月20美元。付费版功能包括高峰时段免排队、快速响应以及优先获得新功能等。

Linux 6.3 引入 IPv4 BIG TCP 以提高高速网络性能

自去年以来，Linux 内核已在 IPv6 上支持了 BIG TCP，以允许更大的 TSO/GRO 数据包大小。这为 IPv6 的性能带来了显著的提升，尤其是在 25~100+ Gbit 的网络空间，同时也带来了更低的延迟。随着 Linux 6.3 的推出，类似的优势也在 IPv4 领域得到体现。

老王点评：从基准测试数据看，这对于高速网络的性能提升相当可观。




AI 写作正在影响出版业

截至 2 月中旬，亚马逊的 Kindle 商店中有 200 多本电子书将 ChatGPT 列为作者或共同作者，这包括《如何使用 ChatGPT 写作和创建内容》、《家庭作业的力量》和诗集《宇宙的回声》。而且这个数字每天都在上升。亚马逊上甚至出现了一个新的子类型：关于使用 ChatGPT 的书籍，完全由 ChatGPT 撰写。

而另外一则 消息 显示，科幻杂志《Clarkesworld》正在暂停提交短篇小说。去年年底以来，他们的短篇小说的投稿量大增，但大部分写作似乎来自人类依靠人工智能工具抽出的文本。

吴国盛教授的《什么是科学》近期发行了第二版（以下简称吴著），第二版除了文字表达上做了小幅修订外，还增加了两个附录，一是对各种批评的回应，一是对本书主旨在科学哲学上的支持，值得读者留意。
本书主旨之一，是指出科学的真正鼻祖不是东方的实用技术，而是希腊的演绎科学（几何与哲学）。这一主旨让那些沉浸在李约瑟汇编的中国古代科技辉煌之中的人，实在感觉不爽。但不爽归不爽，事实终究无法否认。吴著以真正的文化自信和深入浅出的笔法，描绘出中华文明与希腊文明的不同。好比说前者建了一所精致的房子，后者栽了一棵漂亮的树，它们各自精彩动人，很难说谁比谁更真实、更好，但确实大为不同。当后者长出甜美的水果时，你不能以为前者本来也能长出那样的水果。吴著就是告诉我们，那是一个误解，而且是一个于事无补的误解。
我们当然也想吃到甜美的水果，那就需要我们去认真看看那棵树，特别是它的底部。吴著表明，希腊的科学是演绎科学，它纯粹为“自身”而存在，没有功利目的、实用目的，这一特征同中华古典文明的旨趣适成对照（39页）。作者小心地表示这是希腊科学作为其学科存在的特征，意谓这种特征不必完全契合每位科学家的动机和行为。当然，科学的特征无法全然不受科学家的动机和行为的影响，而后者是在具体的社会生活环境中形成和展现的。就古希腊城邦而言，那是自由成年男性的“公共”场合，女性无权参与这个场合，另有大批奴隶供养着他们的日常生活。因而，他们是贵族式的学者，既有闲暇保证又有兴趣来支撑着他们思考宇宙的奥秘、推断事物的原理，追求纯粹为“自身”而存在的“无用之学”。提及这一点，意在提示“无用之学”与“有用之学”之间具有复杂关系，但绝不能否认吴著所揭示的希腊价值观对产生这种科学的关键作用：纯粹的科学必须是为着求知本身的目的而不是任何其他目的而存在（40页）。…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[微分分析仪是一种能够求解微分方程的机械式模拟计算机。它已经不再使用了，因为如今最便宜的笔记本电脑都能更快地解决相同的问题，并且你还可以同时在线刷剧。然而在数字计算机发明之前，微分分析仪使数学家能够完成一些用其它工具不可能完成的计算。

现如今很难想象一台不是由印刷的数字电路组成的计算机竟然是可以正常运作的。机械计算机听起来就像是从蒸汽朋克小说里跑出来的一样。事实证明微分分析仪不但能用，而且还是一些研究领域中必不可少的工具。它最为人所知的应用是曾被美国陆军用于编制火炮射表。如果没有射表辅助瞄准，口径再大的火炮也无法充分发挥效能。所以理论上来说，微分分析仪在帮助同盟国赢得二战上发挥了重要作用。

要弄清微分分析仪是如何做到这些的，你首先得知道什么是微分方程。已经还给学校了？没事，我也一样。

微分方程

你首次接触微分方程应该是在大学《微积分 I》的最后几周。在学期的这个阶段，你那薪资低微的兼职教授应该已经教授过极限、导数和积分这些概念了。在这些概念之上再引入等号，现在你就得到了一个微分方程。

微分方程描述了一个变量相对于另一个（或多个）变量的变化率。形如  的常见代数式表示变量 y 与 变量 x 之间的关系。形如  或  的微分方程表示变化率与其它变量间的关系。本质上微分方程就是用纯数学方式来描述变化率。前面第一个方程表示 “变量 y 相对于变量 x 的变化率刚好等于 x 。”第二个方程表示“无论 x  的值是多少， y 相对于 x 的变化率总是 2。”

微分方程非常有用，因为在现实世界中，描述复杂系统从一个瞬间到下一个瞬间的变化往往比想出一个描述系统在所有可能的瞬间的方程要容易。因此，微分方程被广泛应用于物理和工程领域。一个著名的微分方程是热传导方程heat equation。它能描述热量在物体中的扩散过程。要提出一个完全地描述物体在某时刻 t 的热量分布的…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[On a mac and even on Windows, I can be okay without a touchscreen because pinch to zoom on the trackpad works exactly the same as if it was the touchscreen, however after almost 1 year since I switched to linux, I haven't been able to find a distro/laptop/DesktopEnvironment/Wayland-x11 combination that gives me TRUE pinch to zoom on touchpad like the mac or windows.
 WHY? I have some laptops with touch displays, and the pinch to zoom works fine on those screens but not on the touchpad of the same laptop, it's as if the OS couldn't understand that I'm trying to do the same thing on the touchpad as if I was on the touchscreen, the best I can get is browser zoom % increase which is SHIT compared to actually zooming in on content by pinching.
 Any solutions to this?

And it got me wondering, how is the current career climate for developers who aren't in the US? I still get my daily recruiter spam in my inbox for companies hiring in west-Europe, it hasn't stopped.

We built Moonrepo to simplify repository management, project ownership, task running, and everyday developer and productivity workflows.
If you’ve used Bazel (or another “enterprise” build system) in the past, you’re probably aware of how complex they can be to setup, configure, and use. Let alone the cognitive overhead required by developers on a day to day basis. After more than a decade in the industry, with many of those years working on infrastructure and developer tooling related products, we set out to build Moon, a language agnostic build system.
Existing systems focused solely on runtime logistics (faster builds, concurrency), while we want to also focu…]]></summary>

Today we're launching phind.com, a developer-focused search engine that uses generative AI to browse the web and answer technical questions, complete with code examples and detailed explanations. It's version 1.0 of what was previously known as Hello (beta.sayhello.so) and has been completely reworked to be more accurate and reliable.
Because it's connected to the internet, Phind is always up-to-date and has access to docs, issues, and bugs that ChatGPT hasn't seen. Like ChatGPT, you can ask followup questions. Phind is smart enough to perform a new search and join it with the existing conversation context. We're merging the best of ChatGPT with the best of Google.
You're probably wondering how it's different from the new Bing. For one, we don't dumb down a user's query the way that…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[GNU Linux-libre 6.2 继续进行“去污”战争

随着 Linux 6.2 的发布，GNU Linux-libre 6.2 跟随发布了去除内核中的无源代码的二进制块（BLOB）的版本。Linux 的源代码中包含了很多厂商没有提供源代码的执行代码，这些代码以编码后的数字序列的形式存在，伪装成数据的样子。并不是所有的数字序列都是这种二进制块，有一些是配置数据。但这种无源代码的二进制块，对于希望运行自由的内核的人来说，是不可接受的，因为你并不知道这些代码在做什么。


消息来源：Phoronix



老王点评：在如今的世界，追求纯粹的自由，可能的结果就是你不能自由的使用很多硬件。虽然我不会用这样的自由内核，但是我赞赏并鼓励这样的内核存在。




Windows 11 在“不支持的”电脑上显示水印

对于那些电脑没有满足 Windows 11 的硬件要求而强制升级的人来说，微软最近发布了一个更新“提醒”他们。如果 Windows 11 注意到它在不符合最低要求的硬件上运行，就会持续在桌面的右下角显示“未满足系统要求”。没有达到 Windows 11 最低硬件要求的电脑，很多都是缺少 TPM 2.0（可信平台模块）芯片，微软在升级前需要这个模块，大多数新的 CPU 和主板都内置了它，但在 Windows 11 发布之前，该功能并没有完全普及。


消息来源：Gizmodo



老王点评：不支持就不支持吧，还被羞辱了。




英特尔开源其基于 CPU 的 OpenCL 运行环境

这是英特尔开发的基于 CPU 的 OpenCL 实现。多年来，还有其他同类实现，而英特尔的 OpenCL CPU 运行环境可能是特性最多和性能最好的。这次开源源于一个多年前的请求，早在 2020 年，英特尔的工程师就有迹象表明他们想要开源，现在他们终于成功地做到了这一点。等待登陆英特尔的 LLVM 存储库下游的这个合并请求相当大，包含了 718,996 行新代码，分布在 2750 个文件中。


消息来源：Phoronix



老王点评：这应该给英特尔点赞！至少他们会响应社区号召，并审慎的采取行动。]]></summary>

我通常在家架设运行一个由一打计算机组成的家庭网络 —— 没错，正好 12 台计算机。同时我还负责其它地方的一些计算机维护工作。由于计算机很多，总会出现各种各样的故障，其中有很多最终确诊为硬件问题。但是要判定出是哪个硬件设备引发的故障却是一件难事。

就在这周，我的主工作站上出现了一个棘手的问题，导致我两次误判了问题的原因。本文将带你跟随我排查问题的过程。我将告诉你我在哪一步做了错误的判断以及为什么，还有误判是多么容易发生。

最初的症状

我手上一直有好几个项目。最近，我在几台台式机上打开了很多应用程序，我刚开始工作，突然就黑屏了。主工作站的大多数（不是全部）风扇都停了，这让我倒吸一口凉气。我从来没有遇到过这种情况，但显然我的系统出问题了。

我有两条主要线索可以跟进：一是显示黑屏，二是有些风扇不转了。但是前面板上的电源和磁盘活动指示灯还是亮的，只是比平常要暗一点。大多数安装在主板、内存条和风扇上的 RGB 装饰灯也都灭了。

我试过按电源键和重启键，都没有反应。我直接按供电单元的船型开关关闭了电源。重新供电后还是出现了刚才的症状。

最初的猜想

问题的现象和我数十年处理各类故障的经验将原因指向了供电问题。

我将供电单元拆了下来并用电源测试仪对它进行了检查。结果是供电单元没有任何问题，各项电压都符合规范。当然测试仪的结果也可能是错误的。测试仪并没有在满负荷状态下进行测试，比如计算机运行中耗电几百瓦的情况。我凭直觉更换了一个一千瓦的备用电源。

由于我的家庭网络中有 12 台计算机，我已经习惯准备了一些备用配件在身边。这样当有配件损坏时，我就不必非得跑一趟附近的电脑城或者网购后等快递了。由于计算机这么多，配件损坏是…]]></summary>

This is used by utils like Everything, WizTree, TreeSize etc that work much faster, provide instant search results etc. Even on a 4TB drive with millions of files these utils work very fast and dont have to scan the drive.
 Do inodes in Linux provide similar functionality? And are there any utils which do a similar job? This qn is for ext3/4, I think btrfs/xfs may have more metadata.

格林布拉特（Stephen Greenblatt）早年从廷臣诗人罗利开始其文艺复兴研究，1973年出版了立足于博士论文的著作《罗利爵士：文艺复兴时期的人及其角色》（Sir Walter Ralegh: The Renaissance Man and His Roles），开始关注文艺复兴时期的身份塑造问题。他曾在大学课堂上讲授马克思主义美学，后来改为“文化诗学”。相比于文化研究，他的“文化诗学”更强调广义文化问题中的“诗学”要素，这也贯彻在他后来的研究中。1980年，格林布拉特出版了代表作《文艺复兴时期的自我塑造》（Renaissance Self-Fashioning: From More to Shakespeare），此书是其影响最大的作品。他后来主要在两方面实践其新历史主义原则：一方面主编相关研究著作来完善新历史主义的理论，包括《英国文艺复兴时期形式的权力》（Power of Forms in the English Renaissance, 1982）、《再现英国的文艺复兴》（Representing the English Renaissance, 1988）、《实践新历史主义》（Practicing New Historicism, 2000）；另一方面扩展莎士比亚研究，引领了新的莎士比亚研究的风向。除了《文艺复兴时期的自我塑造》中有关《奥赛罗》的研究外，他后来出版了《莎士比亚的协商：英格兰文艺复兴时期社会能量的流转》（Shakespearean Negotiations：The Circulation of Social Energy in Renaissance England，1988）、《炼…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[本指南将详细解释你在 Arch Linux 中安装 MATE 桌面所需的步骤。


本指南分为两部分。第一部分讨论安装基础 Arch 系统。第二部分是在 Arch Linux 上安装完整的 MATE 桌面环境。

本文在以下版本中进行了测试：MATE 1.24 和 MATE 1.26。

什么是 MATE 桌面?

当 GNOME 桌面从 GNOME 2 改变方向到 GNOME 3 时，改变了用户交互和界面，MATE 桌面仍然延续了“较旧的”或者说“传统的” GNOME 2 的开发方向。因此，MATE 桌面环境保留了 Linux 中的传统桌面体验。它速度快，内存消耗低。在我看来，MATE 桌面环境是一个被低估的桌面环境，需要更多的关注！

MATE 团队一直在继续开发，它是一个基于 GNOME 2 的流行桌面之一，但同时支持更新的技术。你可以在其 官方网站 上了解更多信息。

在 Arch Linux 中安装 MATE 桌面

第一部分: 安装 Arch Linux

如果你已经安装了 Arch Linux，则可以跳过此步骤，直接转到下面的 MATE 桌面安装部分。

要快速安装 Arch Linux，请按照这个自动化的 archinstall 指南 进行操作，该指南非常容易上手。安装完成后，继续至第二部分。

第二部分：在 Arch Linux 中安装 MATE 桌面

重新启动后，从 GRUB 中选择 Arch Linux。在 Arch Linux 提示符下，按顺序运行以下命令。这些命令将安装 Xorg 服务器、显示管理器、MATE 桌面组件、控制器包以及其他应用程序。

对于所有命令，请使用默认值，即在询问时按 Enter 键。

安装 Xorg。安装大小大约为 80 MB。

sudo pacman -S --needed xorg


安装显示管理器和 MATE 桌面组件。安装大小大约为 380 MB。

sudo pacman -S --needed mate mate-extra ttf-freefont lightdm lightdm-gtk-greeter



LCTT 译注：在 Arch Linux 中，很多时候 lightdm 显示管理器需要额外的配置才能正常启用。可以参考：LightDM - ArchWiki。除此之外，可以安装 lightdm-gtk-greeter-settings 来对 lightdm-gtk-greeter 进行配置。




安装应用软件：

这只是一个参考。你也可以安装你所需要的内容。

sudo pacman -S --needed firefox vlc filezilla leafpad xscreensaver archlinux-wallpaper


现在是时候以服务的方式启用显示管理器和网络管理器了。这样，下次登录时，它们就可以通过 systemd 自动运行了。

systemctl enable lightdm
systemctl enable NetworkManager


使用重启命令重启系统：

reboot


如果一切顺利，你应该在 MATE 桌面上看到登录提示。

现在你可以使用刚刚创建的用户 ID 和密码登录。一个超快速和传统的 MATE 桌面将欢迎你的到来。



我希望本指南能帮助你从头开始创建自己的 Arch Linux 环境，并使用传统的 MATE 桌面。

 Installation was quick and easy. Do a search to find specifics for installation on your distribution. 
 I modified a control file to permit my id and root to create tables (akin to crontab). I added my id and 'root' to '/etc/incron.allow' using 'nano' (use your favorite editor). 
 I created a table to control which files and folders INCRON will monitor. This is much like 'cron' with a command (incrontab -e) to create and modify the table.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey, guys. I've just made a plugin which turns your pandas dataframe into a tableau-style component. It allows you to explore the dataframe with easy drag-and-drop UI.
You can use PyGWalker in Jupyter, Google Colab, or even Kaggle Notebook to easily explore your data and generate interactive visualizations.
PyGWalker (pronounced like "Pig Walker", just for fun) is named as an abbreviation of "Python binding of Graphic Walker".
Here are some links to check it out:
The Github Repo: https://github.com/Kanaries/pygwalker
Use PyGWalker in Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/asmdef/pygwalker-test
Feedback and suggestions are appreciated! Please feel free to try it out and let me know what you think. Thanks for your support!

2016 年 AI 战胜了人类围棋高手，此事被视为 AI 崛起的里程碑，但之后意外为人类翻盘。一位美国业余棋手利用计算机发现的一个先前未知的缺陷击败了 AI，他在没有计算机直接支持的情况下赢得了 15 场围棋人机对决中的 14 场。AI 研究公司 FAR AI 设计了一个程序，与顶级 AI 系统 KataGo 下了超过一百万局，以发现人类棋手可利用弱点。这次胜利以前没有报道过，但这证明这些系统使用的深度学习模型存在根本性缺陷。

数字隐私和安全的四个谎言？

华盛顿邮报的专栏作家揭露了四个数字隐私和安全方面的谎言，以下是他的观点：


在你的电子邮件地址中替换上 “at” 和 “dot” 来阻止垃圾邮件发送者。 这对网络上搜刮你的电子邮件的人来说，毫无意义。

发送明显是骗局的电子邮件和短信的骗子们是傻子。 不，他们只是筛选那些自信智商在线的傻子。

使用“虚拟私人网络”（这个词的缩写我不能写）来保护网络安全。 对于大部分人来说，没有意义，毕竟主要的安全短板并不在这里。

你的邮件地址和电话号码是秘密的。 其实它们是公开的“秘密”。



消息来源：MSN



老王点评：原文的理由不尽然合理，我同意它的观点，但对原文的理由不是完全赞同，所以上面给出的理由是我提炼的。你怎么看呢？




Linus 发布“路人甲” Linux 6.2 内核

上周日，Linus Torvalds 按延长的时间表发布了 Linux 6.2 内核，他敦促开发者和用户测试新的内核版本，“也许它不像 6.1 那样是一个性感的 LTS 版本，但所有那些普通的‘路人甲’内核也需要一些测试的爱。”也就是说，Linus 认为这是一个平淡无奇的内核版本。但是英特尔可能对此不太认同，因为它的 Arc GPU 已经被发布到了稳定通道，同时，英特尔也为其软件定义的芯片（又称 “英特尔按需”）得到推广而感到高兴。此外，可能更值得关注的是，对苹果的 M1 CPU 的主线支持已经到来。


消息来源：The Register



老王点评：说实话，我一直对 Linux 内核的版本号规则耿耿于怀，太任性了。]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[这是一个令人印象深刻的开源客户端，能帮你将手机与电脑连接起来，现在可用于 iPhone 和 iPad。快来试试看！




KDE Connect 是一种开源工具，可让你将手机与电脑连接起来。

最初，KDE Connect 支持安卓设备与 Linux 连接。渐渐地，他们增加了对 Windows 的支持。

现在，看起来你可以使用 KDE Connect 让你的 iOS 设备（iPhone 或 iPad）连接到你的 Windows/Linux 计算机。

需要注意的是 macOS 也在支持的平台列表中。但是，它仍然是早期发布版本。因此它可能不如在其他平台上那么好用。

苹果应用商店上的 KDE Connect



我们没有注意到任何官方公告。然而，一些用户发现 KDE Connect 在 版本 0.2.1 发布后，就出现在了 苹果应用商店 上供 iOS 用户使用。

苹果应用商店上列出了所有基本功能，包括：


共享剪贴板：在设备之间复制/粘贴。

能够从任何应用程序将文件和 URL 共享到你的计算机。

将手机屏幕用作计算机的触摸板（可视触摸板）。

远程演示模式。

通过手机在计算机上运行命令

端到端 TLS 加密以确保安全。


虽然 KDE Connect 依然是一个开源应用程序，但为符合苹果应用商店的要求，该应用程序的许可与 OMGUbuntu 所发现的有所不同。

同时值得注意的是，这里列出的功能可能与安卓版本不同，但至少我们终于为 iOS 用户提供了 KDE Connect，使其成为连接手机和计算机的真正开源跨平台解决方案。

我可以放心将 KDE Connect 推荐给任何想通过手机来对电脑进行操作的人。

点击下方的按钮即可前往应用程序商店开始安装。你还可以在其 官方下载页面 上找到针对不同支持平台的各种其他安装选项。


KDE Connect（iOS）


你试过 iOS 上的 KDE Connect 了吗？在评论区中让我知道你的想法。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[LibreOffice 的起源故事，它是一个开源的办公解决方案，确保你总是能够访问你的数据并控制你的创造力。


在 2009 年初，OpenOffice.org（OOo）还是微软 Office 在个人办公生产力套件市场的主要竞争对手。这个流行的开源办公套件的社区，期待着 11 月在意大利奥尔维耶托举行的研讨会。事情进展顺利，未来看起来很光明。

可这之后，同年 4 月，甲骨文公司Oracle 宣布了对 太阳计算机系统公司Sun Microsystems 的收购计划。

就个人而言，我觉得这对 OpenOffice.org 来说是个坏消息。甲骨文对开源套件没有兴趣，我料想它会放弃这个项目。当然，我更希望在研讨会上被证明是我想错了。但到最后，甲骨文只派了一名代表来到奥尔维耶托，乏善可陈，含糊其辞地谈论了货币化和品牌重塑。我和其他社区成员们都觉得，最担心的事情成真了。

那一年，社区成员从奥尔维耶托返程之后决定采取行动。是时候兑现 OpenOffice.org 项目的承诺了。我们决心创建一个独立的基金会来管理项目的资产，在社区的保护下促进套件的开发。OpenOffice.org 将不再隶属于哪一家公司，而是属于它的用户和个人贡献者们。

建立基金会

当时，OpenOffice.org 项目分布在世界各地，在语言社区帮助下进行本地化和推广，其中最主要的四个是：


德国：该软件诞生于德国，而且 Star Division（负责 OpenOffice.org 的部门）的总部也在汉堡，因此开发者群体和德语支持者之间沟通顺畅。

法国：政府支持这个开源软件。

意大利：我所在的小组。

巴西。


2010 年初，在法国和德国语言社区的倡议下，最活跃的志愿者 —— 连同一些独立开发者和 SUSE 的开发者们 —— 着手建立了一个复刻项目，旨在作为一个额外的…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[由美国人工智能公司OpenAI开发的语言模型ChatGPT推出后，引发关注及热议。香港大学日前向q师生发出内部邮件，表明禁止在港大所有课堂、作业和评估中使用ChatGPT或其他AI工具，成为香港首间大学明文禁止在课堂等教学行为使用ChatGPT或其他人工智能工具。 


香港大学副校长何立仁在内部邮件中指出，禁止在港大所有课堂、作业和评估中使用ChatGPT或其他AI工具，除非学生事先获得有关课程讲师的书面同意豁免，否则将被校方视为剽窃个案，并指若没有书面许可，ChatGPT和其他基于AI的工具一律不能用于任何涉及学分的活动，如教师怀疑学生使用ChatGPT或其他AI工具，可要求学生就其作业进行讨论、进行额外口试及考试等措施。（中国新闻网）

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[“江深汉广浪滔滔，平畴旷野长堤绕”，祝总斌先生在一篇回忆文章中曾提到这两句汉口广雅中学的校歌歌词，当年我读到就莫名激动，记得还跟祝先生提起、背诵。先生去世的消息传来，我的第一反应竟然就是这两句歌词，一如晋人陆机《叹逝赋》所云：“悲夫，川阅水以成川，水滔滔而日度。世阅人而为世，人冉冉而行暮。人何世而弗新，世何人之能故。野每春其必华，草无朝而遗露。经终古而常然，率品物其如素。譬日及之在条，恒虽尽而弗悟。虽不悟其可悲，心惆焉而自伤。亮造化之若兹，吾安取夫久长。”

为北京大学历史学系学生授课的祝总斌先生

现在想起来，我和祝先生最早的直接接触，就是四十多年前做本科毕业论文。我们那届中国史专业有四十个同学毕业，祝总斌先生负责指导了我们四个即陈苏镇、冷鹏飞、彭永城和我的论文撰写。我选的论文题目是《试论北齐之亡》，当时自己热情还很高，以统治者内部鲜卑和汉人争斗为主线写了将近两万字；写到最后觉得应该提出点儿自己的看法，就把在世界史课上听到的“罗马帝国是被蛮族杀掉的”观点拿来对北齐灭于北周牵强附会解释一番。祝先生认真看了我的论文，很多地方用红铅笔划线进行批注，有一次还专门到宿舍来和我讨论。我记得祝先生先问我：经济文化发达的政权为什么反而被落后的消灭呢？问得我一脸茫然，我其实只讨论了北齐内部问题，并没有研究北周，谈两者关系完全是套用世界史课上的说法。祝先生见此就提示我，是不是北齐内部鲜、汉两强相争变弱了，而北周则正好相反？这下让我顿开茅塞，知道自己读书还是太少了。毕业论文在祝先生的悉心指导下得以完成通过，我内心十分感激。办完毕业手续，我特地到林学院（现北京林业大学）家属院祝先生家里去跟他告别。我告诉祝先生我因“边疆生源哪来哪去”政策被分配回新疆，很可能要回克拉玛依油田工作，祝先生说：“你是做文字工作的啊！要是那里用不上，我们以后需要时可以借调你。”这句话为我失落的心情带来了很大的安慰。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[“你说谁想得到呢？我都活到九十一岁了。”他低声笑着，两眼闪着光，和四十年前第一次见到，以及那以后这么多年来经常见到的，竟是一样明亮的光。停顿一会儿，像是反思自己的感慨，加了一句：“真是有意思。”

阎步克、陈苏镇、罗新与祝先生聊天

2021年元月3号开始，春节前后，我六次拜访祝总斌先生。其实是他元旦后先给打我电话，叫我去他家挑书。我知道他几年来一直在散书。更早十几年，他身体还健朗那会儿，曾经把一本高句骊考古的书塞进我信箱，留个条子说看到我写了高句骊的文章。我对挑书热情不高，主要是因为我自己这些年来苦于无处搁书，也忙着送书散书。但很久没有见祝先生，平时总是听王铿和叶炜说他的情况，心下愧疚，所以一接他的电话，就约好时间去中关园他的府上。3号下午去，第一次看到他帕金森症转为颈项强直后的糟糕状况，心里一阵难过。他坐在轮椅上，脖颈下倾，只能往下看。我尽量坐得低，好跟他的视线保持平直接触。不过他的精神还是相当好，声音不大，却很清晰，有时候还和从前一样干脆有力。

祝总斌先生在家中书房

那天聊了一个半小时，聊得比较散漫，我有意问他北大历史系的事，特别是我自做学生以来听到的一些传说。当然有些是不适合现在写出来的，但他评价那个时代的某些人某些事，持论平允，出以忠恕，我想古人所谓“求仁之术”，亦不过如此。但他并不是不讲原则。在这个话题的末尾，我问：“祝先生，是不是有些错误，是不能犯的？”他回道：“有些错误不能犯，犯了就没法儿补救了。”沉默一会儿，说：“就毁了。”议论到那些为时代浪潮裹挟因而身不由己的人时，他忽然想起一个人：“有个杨柳桥，你知道吗？”我没听说过。他讲了讲杨柳桥的事迹，竟是那种不计个人得失坚持自己学术立场的人。关于杨柳桥，我根据回家后上网搜索所得，结合祝先生所讲，概述如下。
杨柳桥（1907-1993）是河北河间人，本是天津某大学或历史所的教授，在“百花齐放，百家争鸣”时，反对…]]></summary>

expected.


	Please do give 6.2 a testing. Maybe it's not a sexy LTS release
	like 6.1 ended up being, but all those regular pedestrian kernels
	want some test love too.



Headline features in this release include
the ability to manage linked
lists and other data structures in BPF programs,
more additions to the kernel's Rust
infrastructure,
improvements in Btrfs RAID5/6 reliability,
IPv6 protective
load balancing,
faster "Retbleed" mitigation with return stack
buffer stuffing,
control-flow integrity improvements with FineIBT,
oops limits,
and more.

See the LWN merge-window summaries (part 1, part 2) and the KernelNewbies 6.2 page

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all,
 I'm looking for books to learn more about how audio implemented on Linux. For networking, there is a book called Understanding Linux Network Internals and it's a great resource for deep diving into networking subsystem. Is there any book like this for audio? 
 Are snd_* functions responsible from managing audio in kernel?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey everyone. So recently I started watching a few YouTube videos on Linux, just trying to understand it a bit and I am hooked. But before I start deep diving and possibly reading any outdate information or watching things that may confuse me. I figured I would ask here. Now I did do a search in here to try and find some new post that may be asking the same stuff but a lot of it may be outdate. 
 So far I’ve watched a small series from User NetworkChuck on YouTube and it’s been helpful for the most part. I’ve been able to grasp most the information along with following along while using Hack the Box’s online simulator. That being said, I am looking for more information to get me on the right track. 
 Are there any recommended books that people would recommend (Linux Bible, etc.)? Any other YouTuber’s who discuss Linux that’d you recommend? Are there any Linux Distributions or online simulators that would be recommended for someone new looking to practice and follow along?
 I’ll be honest I’m more of a hands of person, so that has me a bit worried about buying a book because tend to be a little difficult in holding my attention. But I am really wanting to commit some time into this and see if this is indeed a career path I would like to pursue. 
 If you read this all and have any advice for me, thank you for your time. I appreciate it.

 Is that a common functionality among terminal emulators? Which other terminal emulators have it, and under which key binding?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have been using Sparse files, to create block device and then use cryptsetup to encrypt it and save personal files and folder in them, Was it easy? No , not at all , those commands would eat my brain up , So i decided to solve it this weekend 
 I present you bash_vault , it cleanly mounts stuff and unmount it , when sent SIGINT or SIGTERM, I made Zenity UI friendly and verbose about what happened correct or what happened wrong, it was in this process I realized I might add features and make it more use friendly. It works like a charm for me. I spent today writing verbose Readme file for it, So if you have interest in some vault like setup , which can be scripted easily to open what you want, or just easy peasy vault which opens and ask you what you want to do, do try it out. 
 Features 
  
 Creating Vaults with Password or Keyfile
  Adding Multiple Passwords or Keyfile
  Deleting Multiple Passwords or Keyfile
  AutoClosing all mount points on exit 
 Toggling on and off a AutoOpen Keyfile ( basically when keyfile is present at said location, you won't be prompted to enter password or choose keyfile , it will auto-open)
 
 Thanks for your interest, Script lacks comments, but i have chosen good variable names (helps me too)

 I'm working on a book about NixOS and I am in extreme need for your feedback. What in your opinion is missing from NixOS wiki, manual, blog posts, etc? Which topics would you like to see covered?
 I'm posting this here instead of the NixOS subreddit because I want to hear from outsiders. I think the NixOS community is missing the mark with stuff that's too hardcore for the average person. Think of it as an "outside-of-nix" survey. There's already a "NixOS survey" with little purpose for our case, since I would want to target people outside of NixOS - those make the majority and are the ones who would ensure the healthy growth of nix ecosystem given the opportunity to get better with nix.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[无法从 Ubuntu Linux 中消除 Ubuntu Pro 的广告

在更新 Ubuntu 时，它会提示你安装 esm-apps 软件包，以通过 Ubuntu Pro 获得更多的安全更新。当然，你可以获得一个免费的 Ubuntu Pro 账户，为不超过 5 台的计算机获得更多安全支持。但是，如果你不想用它，也不想看到这个广告信息，你可能认为永久防止这些信息的方法之一是删除提供 Ubuntu Advantage 集成的软件包。但你不能这样做。正如 Ubuntu #1950692 错误所描述的，该软件包现在是核心的 ubuntu-minimal 元包的一个依赖关系，所以如果你删除它，它将会删除其他多个核心包。


消息来源：The Register



老王点评：就没有“免费”的午餐，但是 Canonical 一直将广告打到 Ubuntu 中，并且不能删除，总是有些失望。




新的 GitHub Copilot 将为开发者写出 40-60% 的代码

GitHub 更新了它的 Copilot 编码助手，变得更智能，它建议的代码的接受度从 2022 年 6 月的 27% 提升到现在的 46%，而 Java 代码的接受度甚至高达 61%。此外，它还新提供了一个漏洞过滤系统，以阻止不安全的编码模式，如 SQL 注入或硬编码凭证。新的漏洞扫描器使用大型语言模型来“接近静态分析工具的行为”，虽然不会像那样严格。


消息来源：Dev Class



老王点评：就像大部分手工制品都会被机器淘汰，以后编码这种手工活早晚被替代。




非 GNU/Linux 的 Linux

有一些 Unix 极客坚持认为 Linux 应该正确地被称为 GNU/Linux，因为内核是用 GNU C 编译器构建的，所有东西都是针对 GNU C 库链接的，使用 GNU Coreutils，通常还有来自 GNU 项目的其他多个组件。Chimera Linux 是一个正在建设中的新发行版，它不仅是无 systemd 的，而且也是无 GNU 的。它的创建者希望在今年春天达到 alpha 测试。Chimera 用 LLVM 编译，使用与轻量级 Alpine Linux 发行版相同的 musl C 库和打包工具，新的 Dinit 初始化系统，用户空间其余的大部分都来自当前版本的 FreeBSD。


消息来源：The Register



老王点评：这说明 Linux 并不一定必须的 GNU 的，也可以是 Free 的。]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[在这篇文章中，我们将介绍如何在笔记本电脑或台式机上一步一步地安装 elementary OS 7，并附有截图。它基于最新和稳定的 Ubuntu 22.04 LTS。

elementary OS 7 的代号为 “Horus”，并带来了很多改进，例如：


改进了 AppCenter 和安装所有需要的应用。

改进了侧载和可选商店（Flathub）的体验。

最新的 GNOME Web 43，支持创建网络应用。

快速获得操作系统和应用的更新

电源配置文件管理

应用描述的改进


elementary OS 7 的系统要求


双核 64 位处理器

4GB 内存或更多

32GB 硬盘

互联网接入

可启动的 USB 驱动器（4GB 存储空间）


闲话少说，让我们进入安装步骤：

1）下载 elementary OS 7

使用下面的官方网址来下载 ISO 文件。


下载 elementary OS 7 ISO


ISO 文件下载完成后，将其刻录到 USB 驱动器，并使其可启动。

在 Windows 操作系统中，用 Rufus 制作可启动的 USB 驱动器。在 Linux 中，请参考以下网址：


如何在 Ubuntu/Linux Mint 上创建可启动的 USB 驱动器


2）用可启动介质启动系统

现在用可启动的 USB 驱动器启动目标系统。从 BIOS 设置中把启动介质从硬盘改为 USB。当系统用 USB 驱动器启动时，我们将看到以下页面。



3）选择安装语言

选择你喜欢的语言，然后点击“选择Select”。



4）选择键盘布局

在这一步，你将被要求选择键盘布局，然后点击“选择Select”。



5）尝试或安装 elementary OS

我们将看到下面的页面，在这里我们必须选择安装类型。它给了我们以下选项：


试用演示模式Try Demo Mode – 试用 elementary OS 7 而不安装

擦除磁盘并安装Erase disk and Install – 安装程序将擦除整个磁盘并自动创建所需分区。

自定义安装（高级）Custom Install (Advanced) – 它将给我们一个选项来创建自定义分区。


在这篇文章中，我将使用第二个选项（擦除磁盘并安装）。



点击“擦除磁盘并安装Erase disk and Install”。

在下面的屏幕上，选择要安装操作系统的驱动器，然后点击“擦除并安装Erase and Install”。



如果你想对设备的驱动器进行加密，那么点击“选择密码Choose Password”，否则点击“不加密Don’t Encrypt”。



6）安装进度

正如我们在下面看到的，安装已经开始，并且正在进行中。



安装完成后，安装程序将提示重启系统。



点击“重启设备Restart Device”，不要忘记从 BIOS 设置中改变启动介质，以便用磁盘启动。

7）创建本地用户并设置主机名

当系统在安装后启动时，系统会提示你输入本地用户的详细信息和系统的主机名。

根据你的要求指定这些细节。



点击“完成设置Finish Setup”。

在下面的页面中，你将被提示输入你在上面创建的本地用户凭证。



输入凭证后，点击回车。

8）elementary OS 7 欢迎页

我们将看到下面的欢迎页。



选择“跳过所有Skip All”。



点击“开始使用Get Started”，然后我们会看到下面的桌面。



很好，这表明你已经成功地在系统上安装了 elementary OS 7。这就是本指南的全部内容，请探索这个令人兴奋的 Linux 发行版并享受其中的乐趣吧😊。

问：你能告诉我们一下你目前的角色和对开源的贡献吗？

答： 我目前是一名从事自动化工作的架构师。我领导着多个团队，并且同时主要在开源安全服务平台 Invinsense 上作出贡献。我在 1998 年初创建了开源小组，当时已经有大约 1500 名成员。我现在管理的一个小组 (https://groups.google.com/g/vglug) 自 2014-15 年以来一直非常活跃。

问：你是如何开始在开源项目中工作的？

答： 我是一名有着从业资格的机械工程师，当时我在我的公司 ElectroMech Corporation 负责调制解调器和 UPS 系统。我慢慢地被拖入负责 PC、网络和 Linux 等等。1996 年，我在核科学中心看到超过 150 台计算机服务器在 Linux 上运行时广受启发，之后便开始尝试。自此我将我的公司完全转变为专注于培训和支持的开源公司。

我可以自豪地说，我是最早一批使用开源的人 —— 帮助客户了解什么是开源、它有什么好处、什么是免费的、安全或代码问题等等。我们在 Vadodara 得到了至少四五个客户，并且最终通过黄页上的广告宣传自己。我们与 Red Hat 合作并且关系一直持续到现在。

问：自那以来你认为开源发展如何？

岸本美绪是日本著名的明清史研究学者，其新著《风俗与历史观：明清时代的中国与世界》在去年由理想国·广西师范大学出版社推出。这本书涉及的话题，涵盖了岸本美绪教授长期以来重要的研究课题，无论是围绕契约而谈经济史，还是由风俗而谈社会史，这些研究始终贯穿着岸本美绪教授对于历史的一种思考——“依据当时人的思考理路去理解明清时代的社会现象”，以及将这些社会现象的变化放在广域性的视野下，用比较史的眼光进行把握。近期，《上海书评》专访岸本美绪教授，请她谈谈新作与历史研究的方法。

《风俗与历史观：明清时代的中国与世界》

本书的议题比较多样，书名的“风俗”一词，可能是贯穿这些议题的关键词之一。您从中国知识人对“风俗”概念的关注延伸出具有普遍意义的方法性概念的探讨，又在具体案例中讨论了名片的使用与自称的写法、老爷与相公的称呼对象及其流转等。您能否谈一谈，“风俗”这种难以把握却拥有着巨大影响力的不可思议的侧面，具体是如何与您“依据当时人的思考理路去理解明清时代的社会现象”这一逐渐生成的问题意识关联起来的？在考察顾炎武的经世论时，您将顾炎武对“国家、制度”脆弱不可靠的感知与他对“风俗”的强调对举，那么您如何看待“国家、制度”与“风俗”之间的关系？
岸本美绪：如您所说，“依据当时人的思考理路去理解明清时代的社会现象”这一问题意识，从我研究生阶段着手考察明清时代的物价、经济问题开始，就一直贯穿于我的研究之中。不过，说是“思考理路”，但它在多大程度上被语言明确表达出来，就有着各种各样的情况了。当然，在以文献解读为主要研究方法的历史学研究中，明确写有作者思考过程的文献是非常珍贵的，因此，所谓的“思想史”研究，大多以具备语言能力的大思想家、知识人的著作为中心。然而，那些在底部推动着社会经济运转的普通人在想什么，后世的研究者即使想去了解也很难弄清楚。面对这种困难，我们要有足够的自觉。特别…]]></summary>

你可以通过 Flatpak 安装 Live Captions。

如果你的 Linux 发行版没有附带软件中心，请从终端手动安装它。首先，添加 Flathub 仓库：

$ flatpak remote-add --if-not-exists flathub https://flathub.org/repo/flathub.flatpakrepo


接下来，安装应用：

$ flatpak install flathub net.sapples.LiveCaptions


启动 Live Captions

要启动 Live Captions，从你的应用菜单中启动它。

或者，你也可以使用 flatpak 命令从终端启动它：

$ flatpak run net.sapples.LiveCaptions


你也可以使用类似 Fuzzpak 的命令：

$ fuzzpak LiveCaptions


当 Live Captions 首次启动时，你会看到一个配置页面：



你可以设置字体、字体大小、颜色等。默认情况下，Live Captions 不是完全确定的文本会以更深的颜色呈现（LCTT 校注：因为有些语音识别结果不能确保完全正确）。如果你使用实时字幕是为了方便，这可能没有必要，但如果你听不到视频的声音，那么知道哪些文本可能不正确是有用的。

你可以随时返回偏好页面，所以你的选择不一定是最终的。

使用 Live Captions

当 Live Captions 开始运行，任何通过系统声音传来的英语单词都会被打印到 Live Captions 窗口中。

这不是一项云服务。不需要 API 密钥。没有遥测或间谍活动，也没有数据收集。事实上，它甚至不需要网络权限。Live Captions 是开源的，所以没有使用专有的服务或库。

要改变声音输入，请点击 Live Captions 窗口左上方的麦克风图标。要打开 “偏好Preferences” 窗口，请点击 Live Captions 窗口左下方的齿轮图标。

开放访问

根据我的经验，Live Captions 的结果是好的。它们并不完美，但在小型的 Jitsi 视频通话中，它很出色。即使是小众的视频（例如 Warhammer 40K 的激烈比赛），它也做得出奇地好，只在最虚构的科幻术语上磕磕碰碰。

让开源代码易于访问是至关重要的，最终它有可能使每个人受益。我个人不需要 Live Captions，但当我不想听视频的时候，我喜欢使用它。当我希望得到帮助以专注于我可能会分心的事情时，我也会使用它。Live Captions 不仅仅是一个有趣的开源项目，它也是一个重要的项目。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[谷歌此前宣布 Chrome 浏览器将支持内存节省和节能模式，现在这两个功能模式开始面向 Mac、Windows、Linux, 以及 Chromebook 广泛推出。谷歌 Chrome 的内存节省和节能模式默认启用，可以从 Chrome 设置 > 性能（在侧边栏）中打开 / 关闭。


内存节省模式会自动“从不活动的标签中释放内存”，以便为电脑上的其他页面和应用程序提供更多资源。不活动的页面将在标签条中保持可见，并在导航到它时立即重新加载。


在地址栏中，Chrome 浏览器将用速度表图标显示该标签被冻结，并支持“再次活动”。


如果用户遇到内存节省的问题，或者不喜欢在离开设备后等待标签刷新，Chrome 允许用户手动将网页添加到始终保持这些网站活动的列表中。


IT之家从谷歌处获知，使用内存节省模式，Chrome 浏览器使用的内存最多可以减少 30%，它可以用来保持活动的视频和游戏标签顺利运行。


然后是 Chrome 节能模式，“Chrome 通过限制背景活动和视觉效果来节约电池电量”。这包括动画和平滑滚动，以及降低视频帧率。当激活时，用户可能会“注意到游戏和视频性能的变化”，而它由 Omnibox 右边的叶子图标表示，并能快速禁用。


除了开 / 关，还有两个选项支持自动启用。



	

	
只在电池处于 20% 或更低时开启

	

	

	
当电脑被拔掉电源时开启

	



内存节省模式和节能模式随 Chrome 110 在 Mac、Windows 和 Chromebook 上广泛推出。如果还没有上线，用户可以使用以下 flag 启用。


chrome://flags/#battery-saver-mode-available


chrome://flags/#high-efficiency-mode-available

So we started to build an app that can showcase our content, without having to pick a platform. You can use Sora to publish a few different content types.
- Blog
- Polaroid
- Poster
- Microblog
You can either display them all on your Sora profile as a summary (like mine https://topcat.sora.city), or put any of them forward for the world to see.
We plan to run this app for a long time and looking for feedback, so let us know what you think! (feedback@sora.city, or link on website)

Our stack today is Node, Typescript, NextJS, atomic CSS, with everything stored on Supabase.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm genuinely mystified as why people still choose ext4 and XFS, or, I suppose, any other filesystem from the 1990s, over ZFS, or even btrfs.
 I spent this morning with NILFS2, a lightly used log structured files system, and, while XFS and ext4 are very robust, NILFS2 features seem like magic compared to those of XFS or ext4. 
 This feeling is familiar. I've been using ZFS for years now.
 I just find it weird I can view unique snapshot file versions, and restore them immediately if I want to, or view them as a diffs against the live file, while others go digging through backups, or don't because that's a pain. That others make preventative copies, and I just say "YOLO". Why? Because snapshots are cheap. Why not take automatic, non-periodic snapshots, before you edit any file on my system? I don't have to wait hours to calculate rsync deltas, I just send the 4KB that changed.
 I can't get over this attitude of "I don't need all that/ZFS", combined with "Why are backups so hard? And why do they take so long?", "I really could use a version of this file I had 3 days ago", "I'm just crossing my fingers and hoping my tar solution doesn't break." 
 Are you guys stuck for some reason? Can I help?

 NILFS2 is a very interesting log-structured filesystem which appears to take continuous snapshots. That is -- you can simply stop the filesystem's GC and rollback, or mount the filesystem at any transaction point. 
 This feature was so interesting to me, it served as inspiration for ounce, a wrapper script for httm which give you no mental overhead, non-periodic dynamic snapshots.

 My 11 year old nephew is really interested in learning about coding, and I have an oldish pc I was going to give him. Unfortunately, my sister said I can't give it to just him it would have to be for all the kids. So, I planned on installing an educational linux, so it's not really good for much else. I have an old m.2 sata, I was going to put in it with linux and leave windows on the hdd and just disable the hdd in the bios and, of course, put a password on the bios.

 tldr: where is Linux doing well these days in terms of strengths, adoption and use, and where is it lacking?
 ​
 I was a Linux user years ago and have recently dipped my toe back in. Back in the day, there was a lot of excitement and innovation in the space, and it felt like the world of opensource was led by Linux projects big and small. Many developers preferred working in a Linux environment. 
 Today, opensource is everywhere, whether being used in Linux, windows, mac, mobile, or web. It is possible to install Windows subsystem for Linux and run command line programs and even GUI programs on Windows. Microsoft's Visual Studio Code has become the standard IDE across platforms and Github the standard codebase. CLI is still pretty important for developers, but it seems like you can use any OS you want with relative ease.
 I am thinking of reinstalling linux to make web development with CLI tools liks npm, git, etc easier, but I will have to dualboot for gaming + graphic design. I don't need headaches, I just need things to work as well as they can. I don't want to spend weeks on this. I may just try windows subsystem for Linux, but I do miss running Fedora, etc sometimes.
 So i'm curious, where is linux doing well these days and being used, and where has it been doing less well?

The idea is you work on your design in low fidelity wireframes, while still getting a high fidelity output that you can share or use as a reference for your implementation. The way it works is by mapping low fidelity blocks you draw into high fidelity design system & React components.
I spent several years working on design tools at companies like Airbnb, and I think the ideas behind many of the tools we built for designing at scale could really help startups and small teams as well. I would love any feedback you have!

 First and foremost, I'm on mobile so bear with me for any spelling or grammar mistakes I don't catch and weird formatting.
 Secondly as the title implies what, if anything, helps you determine you have learned a distro enough to be considered proficient/advanced. Working and coming from the Windows side for me I think being able to do things in Linux that I can do in windows including the more advanced things when it comes to troubleshooting is my litmus test but I wanted to get some other experience. I don't know many people irl that use Linux at all (and even for me it's not a daily driver on ALL my machines) so my sample size for questions like these is...well non-existent. But then I remembered the Linux sub reddit. (Adderall shortage is pain)
 Currently I am running the latest Ubuntu LTS and while I feel I am good with it I don't think I would consider myself as having learned it. Troubleshooting and understanding the various issues or weirdness I run into still give me enough issue from time to time, means that Google is still my friend (not that I expect to ever not have to Google something). 
 So for some insight I ask the question once more: what, to you, makes you feel you have learned a Linux distro to a satisfying amount? 
 Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[ChromeOS 现在运行在 Linux 和 Zephyr 之上

你可能知道谷歌的 ChromeOS 是一个 Linux 发行版。但是，现在，它在引擎盖下运行的不止是 Linux。有证据表明，ChromeOS 最初是在 2009 年 11 月从 Ubuntu Linux 中产生的，Canonical 帮助了谷歌。然而，几个月之后，Chrome OS 就切换到了 Gentoo Linux。是的，没错，那个 Linux 铁杆极客的发行版。这是因为“支持特定板卡构建和改进我们的工具的需求变得更加迫切，…&helliportage 的构建工具很适合我们的需要。”但 ChromeOS 也不会停留在 Gentoo 上，最近的 ChromeOS 版本是基于谷歌定制的 Linux 内核的。而如今，它也在实时操作系统 Zephyr 上运行。2021 年 7 月，Chromebook 从最初的谷歌 Chrome 嵌入式控制器切换到基于 Zephyr 的控制器。这是一个永远在线的超低功率微控制器，对于延长 Chromebook 的电池寿命至关重要。


消息来源：The Register



老王点评：简单的来说，就是 ChromeBook 在醒着到时候运行 Linux，睡着时运行 Zephyr。




GoDaddy 遭到了持续多年的入侵

GoDaddy 是世界上最大的域名注册商之一，它还为全球 2000 多万客户提供了托管服务。GoDaddy 是在去年 12 月初收到客户报告其网站被重定向到随机域名后，发现未知攻击者入侵了它的 cPanel 共享托管环境。黑客不仅在它的服务器上安装了恶意程序，还窃取了部分服务相关的源代码。它的调查显示攻击者在它的服务器上活跃了多年，近几年披露的多起安全事故都与此相关。其中 2021 年 11 月的事件影响到了它管理的 120 万 WordPress 客户。


消息来源：Bleeping Computer



老王点评：还好这次披露的事件目前只涉及到 Web 托管部分，而不是 DNS 部分。




谷歌向苹果提供上百亿的 Chrome iOS 搜索收入分成

虽然大家都知道谷歌向苹果、三星和其他制造商支付了数十亿美元，以使其搜索引擎成为设备的默认配置，但据披露，英国竞争和市场管理局一直在调查 iOS 上的 Chrome 浏览器，以及它在谷歌与苹果的搜索收入分享协议中的作用。谷歌与苹果的交易到 2021 年达到了每年 150 亿美元之高。英国竞争监督机构担心，谷歌对苹果的付款使苹果不愿意与谷歌竞争，大量的付款就是为了什么都不做。这或许可以解释为什么苹果公司虽然利润丰厚，但却没有推出搜索引擎，也没有投资开发其 Safari 浏览器与 Chrome 竞争。


消息来源：The Register



老王点评：这或许就是买路钱。]]></summary>

经典计算机是基于二进制数的，二进制数有 0 和 1 两种形式。这并不是由于二进制逻辑系统比有更多基本状态的逻辑系统（甚至包括模拟计算机）有内在优势。而是，对电路元件的开关操作很容易实现，而且借助先进的半导体技术，可以制造出体积小且价格低廉的计算机。

但它们并非没有局限性。经典计算机求解某些问题的效率并不高，主要是那些时间或内存成本随着问题的规模（O）呈指数级增长的问题。我们把这种问题称为 O(2n)（大 O 表示法）。

大部分现代加密方法甚至依赖这一特性。把两个大素数相乘，耗费的成本低（O(n2)），但进行反向操作就非常耗时。所以只要使用的数字足够大，对它分解质因数就非常困难。

进入量子世界

量子计算的基础数学和力学知识不在本文的探讨范围内。然而，还是有一些基础知识需要预先说明。

量子计算机以 量子比特 代替了二进制比特 —— 量子比特是体现量子属性的可控计算单元。构成量子比特的通常是超导元件，或自然界中存在的量子实物（例如电子）。量子比特可以以“叠加superposition”状态存在，叠加态是 0 和 1 以某种方式组合起来的复杂状态。你可能听说过，量子比特既为 1 又为 0，这种说法并不准确。真实情况是，如果进行测量，量子比特的状态会坍缩为 0 或 1。在数学上，量子比特未测量的状态可以看作 布洛赫球面Bloch sphere 的几何表示上的一个点。

尽管对习惯使用经典计算机的任何人来说，叠加态是一个全新的概念，但一个量子比特本身并没有什么趣味性。量子计算的第二个概念是“干涉interference”。真正的量子计算机本质上是统计性质的。量子算法对干涉图案进行编码，增加了可以测量编码方案的状态的概率。

叠加和干涉的概念虽然新颖，但在物理世界中也有对应的…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[GNOME 的设计做了一些有意义的变化，它（某种程度上）带回了一个它早先删除的类似功能。




几年前，GNOME 移除了应用程序的菜单和指示器。

如果你不太清楚，应用程序指示器是一种从顶部面板与后台运行的应用程序进行交互的方式。

是的，你可以 添加一个应用程序指示器的扩展 来获得同样的功能。但是，在使用 GNOME 桌面环境的发行版上，如 Fedora，你不再能找到默认的能力。

然而，Ubuntu，它的一些 官方版本，以及其他发行版如 Pop!_OS，支持系统托盘图标，尽管 GNOME 放弃了它们。

现在，经过多年的设计变化，看起来我们可能会看到类似的东西。

GNOME 将添加一个检查后台活动程序的简便方法

目前，在没有活动窗口的情况下，找出在后台运行的应用程序并没有简便的方法。

你必须使用 任务管理器 或 系统监控工具 以获得更好的观测能力。

在未来的 GNOME 版本中（可能是 GNOME 44），你或许可以期待有一个功能可以直接从顶部面板的菜单面板上监控后台运行的应用程序。



Allan Day 的想法仍在讨论中，他分享了一个 设计模拟图。不过，它很有可能会被接受。

这个想法也促使开发者 Georges Basile Stavracas Neto 披露了 Flatpak 的 xdg-desktop-portal 组件，它可以使得检测运行中的 Flatpak 应用程序变得容易。


📋 检查后台应用程序这个功能的位置或设计仍在进行中；你在上面看到的内容可能会随着最终的实施而改变。


这是否也会使应用指示器回归？

并非如此。

通过这个功能，GNOME 旨在让你快速看到后台运行的应用程序，并对它们进行管理（关闭它们或访问特定的设置）。

然而，你仍需要少量点击来达到这一点 🖱️。

小程序指示器或系统托盘图标是访问在后台运行的应用程序更快捷的方式，尽管不是每个后台应用程序都被列出。

毕竟，这总比没有好。

而最终，这些设计上的变化可能会产生一种直观的方式，以某种形式让应用指示器回归。

💬 你对这个决定与即将发布的 GNOME 设计变化有何看法？请在下面的评论中分享你的想法。

山精的情况与水虎一样，主角是中国的妖怪，图中文字节自《永嘉郡记》，原文为：“安国县有山鬼，形体如人而一脚，才长一尺许。好噉盐，伐木人盐辄偷将去。不甚畏人，人亦不敢犯，犯之即不利也。喜于山涧中取石蟹。同伐木人眠息，便十十五五，出就火边跂石炙噉之。”（见《太平御览》卷九百四十二引）请注意，《永嘉郡记》的原文是“山鬼”而不是“山精”，但图中的形象及情节则与原文甚合。《妖怪大全》里收有“山精”，采用了鸟山的图和文字。另有“山鬼”一则，写的只是一个民间故事，并没有对“山鬼”有所介绍。
这里值得注意的是，中国的山鬼是一足的，而日本山林中的妖怪里山鬼、山爷、山父、山男等也都是一足的，而且不仅一足，还是独眼。柳田国男称这一类妖怪为“一足神”，为多地山民所崇拜。柳田氏还提到甲斐那里有一个村庄祭祀着一个一足鬼的石像，上面用了中国山神“夔”作为“雅称”。但这与中国的“如龙，一足”的“夔”毫无关系，不过是“少了一条腿的狛犬”，只能引起知识者的发笑。——这个事例可以看出一足山鬼在日本民间的野生存在，但民众也希望为它们取得一个更正规些的神名，结果就是从遥远的中国移植了。
鸟山石燕虽然画了《永嘉郡记》中的山鬼，并且在图画中详细地描绘了这山鬼的形态和故事，而这些都不是日本一足鬼所有，可见他丝毫没有把它当成日本妖怪的意思。
玉藻前（九尾狐）

很久很久以前，天地初开，世间一片混沌，一团上升的阴气聚集到了一起，幻化成了一只妖狐。经历了漫长的岁月后，妖狐拥有了不死之身，它全身长着金毛，长长的尾巴分成了九股。人们将其称作“金毛九尾狐”。在中国的商朝，九尾狐幻化成一个绝世美女，魅惑商纣王，做尽坏事。周武王兴兵推翻了商纣王。之后，妖狐去了印度，化身为摩竭佗国斑太子的王妃华阳天，惑乱朝政。后来，九尾狐幻化成少女，搭上了从中国返回日本的遣唐使吉备真备的船。到了日本后，它化为弃婴，被一名武士收养。由于天资聪颖、美貌…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Inspired by an earlier post.
 It seems that Debian is going toward that direction, proven by their recent action.
 SteamOS has KDE as their DE. OpenSUSE has definitely been having KDE as their first class DE along with GNOME.
 Meanwhile, RHEL gang (including Fedora, centOS, AlmaLinux, Rocky Linux) all has GNOME as their main DE. They provide other DEs but none of it feels like it has full support.
 KDE's release cycle is definitely something to improve on, it shouldn't have been a major dealbreaker.
 What's your take?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Both Apple and Microsoft are increasingly disgusting when it comes to privacy and user tracking. 
 But you know the saying, a hero that live long enough may become the villain, specially when it's a company that gets bigger. So, how are things lately on the Linux side, specially between the popular distros like Ubuntu, Fedora and elementary OS, and the companies or maintainers that back those? Any news or raised eyebrows about suspicious or weird practices? Or are they good to go?
 EDIT - As an example I just saw a news report about Ubuntu Advantage. That is the kind of thing I'm worried about, Linux falling into the trappings of tracking and monetization. Canonical is surely raising more than some eyebrows which is a shame, I enjoyed Ubuntu.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[据报道，亚马逊公司要求员工每周至少在办公室工作三天，取消了之前由高级管理人员决定这类工作的政策。


亚马逊首席执行官安迪·雅西（Andy Jassy）发布在亚马逊公司博客上的致员工的备忘录表示，这项规定将于5月1日生效。雅西表示会有例外情况，包括一些销售和客户支持工作，“但那将是一小部分。


雅西说:“当团队成员更频繁地见面时，他们之间往往会联系的更紧密。与同事面对面，看着他们的眼睛，看到他们完全沉浸在你所讨论的将人们联系在一起的事情中，这是非常有益的。”


作为仅次于沃尔玛的美国第二大私营雇主，亚马逊与很多公司一样要求员工更频繁地到岗上班。这些公司正在削减疫情期间提供的一些随时随地工作的灵活性。苹果公司、Alphabet公司和微软公司现在都要求员工每周在办公室工作至少几天。


2021年10月亚马逊曾表示，经理们可以决定员工需要在办公室工作的频率。员工们表示，从那以后，出勤率一直参差不齐。位于西雅图市中心的总部园区有时熙熙攘攘，有时却像鬼城。一些员工，尤其是分散团队的员工，每周有几天要在办公室工作，而其他人自新冠疫情大流行开始以来几乎没有在办公室工作过。亚马逊发言人拒绝透露有多少员工到岗工作。


让大量员工回归可以促进亚马逊周边商业区的发展。在境况不太好的西雅图市中心，亚马逊是迄今为止最大的雇主，除此之外，该公司还是旧金山湾区、纽约、德克萨斯州奥斯汀和洛杉矶地区等城市的主要办公室租户。


“我们的社区对我们很重要，我们可以进一步发挥作用，帮助他们从过去几年的挑战中恢复过来，我们很高兴这样做，”雅西说。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I switched to Linux in Summer 2022. I am using Ubuntu, currently version 22.10. I don't really know any programming languages, albeit I am trying to learn C++. I mostly use my desktop for gaming. There have been some games that I been unable to get running; however, most of them do work. I do feel a great deal of satisfaction whenever I manage to get a game running.
 I wouldn't describe myself as a terribly advanced computer user, indeed, I am most definitely below the average person in the world. However, I have been enjoying Linux so far. I do have some small gripes, such as the abovementioned issues with select games, lack of HDR support, one of my drives constantly un-mounting itself every time I reboot the computer, and others. Nonetheless, I do believe the journey has enrichened me, open my eyes, and that it has brought me a great deal of joy.
 I wonder, can I consider myself to be part of the Linux community even though I am only getting started with programming, don't really do much on the desktop aside from gaming, and am using Ubuntu?
 Thank you. I would love to be a part of the Linux community.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Had a thought recently: Windows maintains dominance in computer software. Almost every company that uses computer software uses Windows, because that software is written for Windows, and therefore pays a premium to do business with computers.
 They pay for licenses, often pay for brand new machines when their Windows version goes out of date etc. etc.
 What exactly is stopping people from becoming "Linux entrepeneurs" and offering to save businesses, libraries and other organizations money by installing low maintenance Linux systems.
 Have people done the cost/benefit analysis on this?

 I keep seeing Linux being recommended to people with weaker hardware, or people who can't afford to buy Windows as an OS, but these arguments don't stand for me because the average user has already got these two problems covered by regular methods. 
 So far, Linux seems mainly about privacy, or very extreme needs, and for people who know how to handle themselves and don't need a support forum like regular "commercial" users. 
 So what are your reasons for using Linux, then, and why do you stick by it? Did you ever permanently switch to another OS?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello,
 So I have a half-decent Hi-Fi setup and recently added a new USB to SPDIF dongle that does 24/96. (The DAC in my AV receiver/amplifier can't handle 44100 Hz correctly and can't handle 192k at all, so 24/96 is the best choice I have). I run Fedora, currently on 36, and KDE Plasma, if this matters.
 Spotify, with its Linux desktop client running as a Flatpak, sounds rather good, but I'd rather try something lossless. But what provider can I use?
 I tried TIDAL. But the web player, with the Hi Fi setting, sounds somewhat worse than Spotify; I guess that Google Chrome might not be doing bit-perfect audio from that lossless stream. The only Linux desktop client for Tidal I found was Strawberry, and I have not as yet managed to get it to connect to TIDAL, though I need to play around with getting files from the mobile phone.
 I tried Apple Music. Their Web client can't do lossless. Nor can Cider. Nor can the Snap version of Apple music desktop (which seems to be a wrapper around the Web client).
 I can't find even a hint of a Linux client for Qobuz or Amazon Music Unlimited.
 So, what ways might there be to get proper lossless streaming on Linux? Or am I limited to Spotify 320k OGG, plus finding FLAC versions of stuff I really want to hear in best quality?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The splice()
system call is built on an appealing idea: connect two file descriptors
together so that data can be moved from one to the other without passing
through user space and, preferably, without being copied in the kernel.
splice() has enabled some significant performance optimizations
over the years, but it has also proved difficult to work with and
occasionally surprising.  A recent linux-kernel discussion showed how
splice() can cause trouble, to the point that some developers now
wonder if adding it was a good idea.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[2月以来，由美国人工智能公司OpenAI推出的大语言模型ChatGPT持续火热，席卷全球。这款“AI神器”已经引发国内互联网巨头的跟进，华为、百度、阿里、京东等确认开发相关产品。除了在科技行业和资本市场备受瞩目之外，这款以AI为核心技术的产品在不少互联网用户中走红。自去年11月30日正式发布以来，ChatGPT的用户规模已达到1亿，成为互联网发展史上用户增长最快的消费级应用。


纵观AI发展历史，每次重要的技术面向大众，都会引发巨大的讨论。这次ChatGPT的发布被不少科技从业者视为标志性事件，甚至是人工智能发展的奇点来临，代表着新一波AI技术浪潮的起点。但科技公司如何面对机遇与挑战，普通人又如何适应与AI共存，值得深入探讨。


360集团创始人周鸿祎在接受中国新闻周刊采访时指出，这次ChatGPT能破圈引发全球讨论，原因是采用了对话形式，让每个普通人都感受到人工智能技术的强大。从意义角度，ChatGPT技术突破了以往弱人工智能的水平，使人类进入强人工智能，或者说是通用人工智能时代。“ChatGPT的智力已经能超出一般的人类了，产生意识可能就是未来几年的事” 。    


“在ChatGPT出现之前，所有AI公司的科技树都点错了”


中国新闻周刊：在您的认知中，ChatGPT是一款什么产品，具备了什么样的能力？


周鸿祎：ChatGPT是美国OpenAI公司旗下的智能聊天工具，属于人工智能应用，其本质属于自然语言处理模型，通过数据训练和模型的持续调整，在海量文本语料库的训练中，最终能够通过学习和理解人类的语言来进行对话。


从技术原理上来看，ChatGPT（聊天机器人程序）背后由大量数据和强大算力做支撑，通过高质量的训练数据，对程序回复进行标注，基于人工反馈的强化学习方法(RLHF)对模型进一步进行微调，使得程序学习人类对于模型回复的评价…]]></summary>

马斯克在迪拜举行的世界政府峰会上表示：“ChatGPT 表明人工智能已经得到了令人难以置信的发展，而这是我们都应该担心的事情。”马斯克是 ChatGPT 背后的 OpenAI 公司的联合创始人，但他已经在 2018 年离开了 OpenAI 的董事会，不再持有该公司的股份。最初 OpenAI 是作为一个开源的非营利组织而创建的，但现在为了盈利而转为闭源。而他决定建立 OpenAI 的部分原因是，“谷歌对人工智能的安全性不够重视。”汽车、飞机和医学等必须遵守监管安全标准，而人工智能还没有任何规则或条例来控制其发展。他认为“需要监管人工智能的安全”，因为它对社会的风险实际上更大，即便监管“可能会使人工智能的速度放慢一些”。

微软称与新必应对话过多会使其“犯糊涂”

在发现由 ChatGPT 驱动的新必应搜索引擎会侮辱用户、对他们撒谎和情绪化地操纵人们之后，微软说它现在正在根据反馈采取行动，以改善回应的语气和精确性，并警告说长时间的聊天会话可能导致问题。必应团队说，它没有 “完全想到” 人们将其聊天界面用于社交娱乐或作为“发现世界的一般工具”。它发现，15 个或更多问题的长时间聊天会话可能会让必应的模型混淆。

龙芯架构开始支持 KVM 虚拟化

虽然 Linux 5.19 合并了龙芯架构的部分补丁，启用了对龙芯 CPU 的支持，但内核移植并没有完全完成，一些龙芯 3A5000 的功能仍未在主线内核启用。周二，龙芯工程师发出了初步的 24 个补丁，以在 3A5000 处理器上支持 KVM 的硬件虚拟化。目前，“已经能够启动龙芯 Linux 客体机”。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[TL;DR of the article:
 Linux has something for everyone. Despite this, and the valiant efforts of 'it just works' distros like Linux Mint, ZorinOS, Ubuntu, Elementary OS, Pop!_OS, etc., Linux still struggles in desktop martketshare. The writer believes that onbaording can help remedy this issue. Much like installing a new app on your phone gives you a quick overview of what the app does and how to use it, onbaording can be done in Linux distros to get users familiar with how the desktop works. This includes updating the system, downloading and installing software, changing system settings, pointing out and explaining useful tools, and so on. In the author's mind, this is done through a step-by-step wizard that points to, or circles, where the user needs to click and what they need to do.
 I know that DE's like KDE Plasma with the 5.27 release have created their own welcome screen, and of course most 'it just works' distros nowadays have their own welcome screens as well. However, this takes it a big step further. Thoughts?

 The goal is to create a "bible" that will hold all the frequently seen process/kernel thread in Linux and to have a short explanation on them (with links to the Linux source code).
 I am going to update it every couple of months. 
 For now it includes: swapper (PID 0), init (PID 1), Kernel Thread, kthreadd (PID 2), migration, charger-manager, idle_inject, kworker, kdevtmpfs, cpuhp, khungtaskd, kswapd, kcompactd, md (Multiple Device Driver), mld (Multicast Listener Discovery), ksmd (Kernel Same Page Merging), ttm_swap, watchdogd, zswap-shrink, khugepaged , krfcommd and ksgxd.
 Where do is the best place to share such a pdf?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[用 Penpot 这个开源的设计工作空间来弥合编程和设计之间的鸿沟。


在计算机编程的大部分历史中，在创建应用的代码的程序员和创建应用的用户体验（UX）的设计师之间一直存在着鸿沟。这两个学科接受的培训大不相同，他们使用的工具也不同。程序员使用文本编辑器或集成开发环境来编写代码，而设计师则经常绘制小部件布局和潜在交互的示意图。虽然一些 IDE，像 Eclipse 和 Netbeans，有界面设计组件，但它们通常专注于小部件的位置而不是小部件的设计。开源设计应用 Penpot 是一个协作式设计和原型设计平台。它有一套新的功能，使设计师和开发者可以很容易地用熟悉的工作流程协同工作。Penpot 的设计界面可以让开发者在设计过程中和谐地编写代码，这是其他工具所无法做到的。自从我们 上次介绍它 以来，它已经有了长足的进步。它的最新功能不仅改善了你使用 Penpot 的体验，还推动了开源的 Penpot 应用超越类似的专有工具。

用 Penpot 做原型

在设计应用的最佳工作方式时，常见问题之一是在设计的时候这个应用还不存在。设计师可以通可视化和故事板来帮助设计团队和程序员了解目标是什么。但这是一个需要迭代和反馈的过程，当开发人员开始实施 UX 设计，设计会发生变化以应对对代码的实际变化。

使用 Penpot，你可以为你的网络或移动应用创建一个“可用”原型。你可以将按钮与特定的行动联系起来，根据用户的输入触发布局的变化。而这一切都可以在项目的代码存在之前完成。

但是，这方面最重要的不是模拟的能力。在 Penpot 中为应用的设计所做的一切都有可用的布局数据，开发人员可以在最终的项目中使用它们。Penpot 不仅仅是一个出色的绘图和布局工具。它为编码过程提供了信息。

Penpot 现在不仅仅是提供了一个设计师特定元素的视觉列表，如属性、颜色和排版，而是将代码输出直接整合到设计工作区（就像 Web 浏览器中的开发者工具）。设计师和开发人员共享设计和前端开发的相同空间，以他们需要的任何格式获得规格。



内存解锁

许多在线设计工具使用专有技术来提供一些花哨的功能，但代价是基本上成为一个应用，你只能运行它，而不能通过浏览器访问。不过 Penpot 使用开放的网络标准，并由你的网络浏览器渲染。这意味着 Penpot 可以访问浏览器可用的最大内存，使得 Penpot 成为第一个具有设计扩展性的在线原型和布局应用。你可以提供更多的选项、更多的模型，和更多的场地。此外，你可以向更多的并发协作者开放你的设计空间，而不必担心应用的内存耗尽。

自我托管和 SaaS

Penpot 是开源的，所以你不用必须在云上使用它，如果这不适合你的工作流程。你可以在一个容器中轻松地自我托管 Penpot，在你自己的工作站上作为一个本地应用使用，或者在你自己的服务器上为你的组织托管它。

开源设计

我以前写过一篇 Penpot 的介绍性文章，自那以后，这个应用变得更好了。如果你想把程序员和相关人员带入你的设计过程中，那么请试试 Penpot。

Namely, the "Enqueue items into playlist in one instance mode." This basically gives me a music queue for all of my music videos that I pulled from iTunes back in the day. Great feature! Thanks to the guys (and gals I assume; they don't have an "About us" page). Take my upvote and (more importantly) my contribution! You can contribute here: https://www.videolan.org/

在大数据和量化分析日益塑造历史写作的时代，张聪却逆流而行。她采用了一种传统人文学科方法来研究宋朝官员所处的一个艰难困境：在照顾父母与频繁离家远宦之间取得平衡。张聪的第一本著作《行万里路：宋代的旅行与文化》（Transformative Journeys： Travel and Culture in Song China，檀香山：夏威夷大学出版社，2011）记录了宋廷因其官员履任或卸任都要耗费数月时间而面临的挑战。《家庭·乡里·朝堂：北宋士人与孝道》从《行万里路》一书中引出了许多主题。该书着眼于在一个高度重视孝道的社会中，父母子女分居生活导致个人所需承担的代价，并将墓志铭书写置于整个丧葬仪式的更广阔背景下进行考虑。
鉴于新冠病毒的肆虐极大地挑战了工作地点远离家庭成员居住地的人们之前做出的种种安排，本书的主题更是恰逢其时。正如本书致谢所示，作者自己在生活中也面临着类似的困境：“研究和撰写本书的过程中，父母和公婆年事日高。因为生活工作的地方离他们太远，一年只能见一两次面，无疑，我们对老人家们亏欠甚多。写作本书的过程因此让我们一家三口无数次地思考孝道的含义和行孝的方式。最重要的是，因为我们不在父母身边，照顾老人们的责任便由我们的姊妹和姊夫妹夫们承担。他们对家庭的诸多贡献，此处难以尽表。”（viii，中译本致谢3）这是一本异常感人的学术著作，或许正是因为书中寄托了作者的个人牵绊。
宋朝官员的职务要求他们离家远宦，导致这些人在如何尽职照顾父母方面常常捉襟见肘。和现在一样，当时大多数年事已高的父母都喜欢住在自己家里，生活环境熟悉，可以随时见到朋友。在一位官员安排母亲陪他宦游多地后，他的母亲终于哀怨地说道：“吾宁归扫丘墓，安邻里乡党以死，何以阅传舍为哉？”（沈括《长寿县君…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Two of the biggest distros - Ubuntu and Fedora - ship with GNOME out of the box. They both have separate editions with KDE but they are listed behind various menus that a newbie should be interested to look through.
 For example on Ubuntu's website, if you want to download Ubuntu for Desktop, you'd probably click the "Ubuntu Desktop" link and you won't notice the flavors section at the bottom right.
 https://preview.redd.it/z899p4gx2oia1.png?width=1397&format=png&auto=webp&s=a7f4f1121110830ce510ec09e6e60a831ad1321c
 And on Fedora's website, it is worse because no where does it mention the various "spins" of Fedora - such as the KDE spin. You need to trudge through the documentation or know about the existence of the spins.fedoraproject.org site. Edit : You have to scroll to the bottom of the page to get a direct link.
 This also doesn't include distros that had a KDE edition and later axed it - most famous of all, Mint. It's rather obvious why they did that - to push their in house DE, Cinnamon. But it still reaffirms how many popular distros which have a "KDE" edition, and either don't show make it accessible to know about. Most of these distros even ship with GNOME or a GTK+ based DE.
 Why do these distros treat KDE as a second class citizen??

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[平台即服务能够快速、轻松地创建网络应用，而无需购买和维护其下的软件和基础设施。本文解释了它为什么有用。


平台即服务PaaS（以下简称 PaaS）指的是云计算服务，它为客户提供了开发、运行和管理应用程序的平台，而免去了建立和维护与开发和启动应用程序相关的基础设施的复杂工作。这是云原生应用和支持系统所依托的核心平台。

PaaS 通常包括不同的应用基础功能，包括应用平台、集成平台、业务分析平台、事件流服务和移动后端服务。此外，它还包括一套与监控、管理、部署相关的功能。

开发人员希望他们的开发环境不需要等待，而运营团队则更关心性能和稳定性。这经常引起两方间的冲突。PaaS 为这两方创造了和平的环境。一个作为服务交付的应用平台被称作 PaaS，它被用于部署用户代码。Cloud Foundry、Cloudify 和 OpenShift 这些开源环境都可用作 PaaS。

PaaS 的采用模式

云计算必须满足五个基本特征：按需服务、接入网络、资源池化、弹性和可度量的服务。为此，云计算提供了三种服务模式：软件即服务Software as a Service（SaaS）、平台即服务Platform as a Service（PaaS）、基础设施即服务Infrastructure as a Service（IaaS）。

业务选用 PaaS 的关键驱动力：


减少提供业务的资本支出和运营费用

通过减少应用程序的交付时间和提高开发和交付质量，最大限度地降低 IT 成本

增加中间件之间的灵活性和集成度


简单 PaaS：踏入 PaaS 领域的入口。它可以提供应用程序服务，并将它们暴露在自助服务的目录中；自动部署和计量服务使用的资源。

管理 PaaS：管理已配置应用程序的服务级别协议SLA和服务质量QoS，例如弹性、应用程序性能、安全性等。

摘要


据报道，流行的桌面和移动网络浏览器 Opera 浏览器正在探索将语言模型 ChatGPT 集成到其产品中。

微软最近宣布将 ChatGPT 的制造商 OpenAI 技术集成到其 Edge 网络浏览器中，为用户添加人工智能功能。


Opera 与 ChatGPT

Opera，一个被广泛使用的桌面和移动网络浏览器，将把语言模型 ChatGPT 集成到它的软件产品中。Opera 的母公司昆仑科技是这一新闻的幕后推手，尽管这次集成的细节仍然有限。Opera 提供了一系列软件产品，包括桌面网络浏览器、移动网络浏览器以及其为 Chromebook 设计的浏览器版本。

最有可能整合 ChatGPT 的是 Opera 的主要桌面浏览器，包括 Opera 浏览器和 Opera GX（这是一款为游戏玩家设计的浏览器）。然而，也有可能集成到 Opera 的移动浏览器中，包括常规的 Opera 移动浏览器、Opera Mini 和 Opera Crypto 浏览器。

来自微软和谷歌的最新更新

微软上周宣布将 OpenAI 集成到其 Edge 网络浏览器中，成为头条新闻。这种集成将在未来为 Edge 用户带来两种人工智能功能，即 “Chat聊天” 和 “撰写Compose”。“聊天”功能可以让用户在浏览器中直接与人工智能交流。同时，“撰写”功能帮助用户进行文本撰写，包括使用不同的语气和长度撰写电子邮件和社交媒体帖子。

在最近的一次演示中，谷歌没有宣布将人工智能聊天机器人直接集成到其 Chrome 浏览器中，这一举措得到的回应并不热烈。

下一步是什么

据 Statcounter 统计，Opera 浏览器被数亿用户使用，在全球浏览器市场占有 2.4% 的份额。虽然它可能落后于谷歌 Chrome 的 65% 和 Safari 的 18%，但与 Mozilla Firefox 的 3% 相比，它仍然保持着自己的优势。

昆仑科技是一家在深圳证券交易所上市的北京公司。本周，中国搜索巨头百度宣布计划在其搜索产品中集成 ChatGPT 风格的机器人。

总之，ChatGPT 与 Opera 浏览器的集成代表着人工智能网络浏览向前迈出的重要一步。随着微软和百度等公司将人工智能技术融入其产品，Opera 将自己定位为该领域的领导者。

随着数亿用户和浏览器市场的日益增长，ChatGPT 与 Opera 的集成是一项备受期待的发展。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[They both have on board RGB, meaning you can get that gamer aesthetic without having to even install software on your computer. This means, of course, that they will work fine on Linux, or even on a console. Even without RGB, it's still a fantastic case because of all the air flow from its mesh panel front that also serves as a dust filter. They're also relatively affordable for your first build, the case is like $90 and the keyboard is like $50. As much of a meme as RGB is in the gaming community, it's honestly really nice and adds a fantastic customizable bit of visual flair, and being able to use it without having to worry about whether or not the software will work on Linux is fantastic. Just a heads up for any noobs: You might need to look up a guide for daisy chaining the fans together. I had to and would have been completely lost without it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm having a crisis of Linux faith right now. I recently built a gaming PC and the only game I'm really playing right now for the past 2 years is Genshin Impact, which will likely never work on Linux due to the kernel level anti-cheat. But I discovered Windows LTSC IOT, which genuinely fixes every gripe I had with windows that made me switch to Linux in the first place. It will be supported until 2029, ALL my games and modding tools will work on it, and I even replaced the desktop environment with Steam or playnite, so it boots faster and has better performance. So unless it's one of those games that Valve made run better on Linux like elden Ring, where they fixed the micro stuttering issue, I have no use for Linux right now on my gaming PC. I guess if Genshin Impact worked on Linux, it would have been the first operating system I installed.
 I don't know where I'm going with this, but it feels weird being a Linux fan who doesn't need Linux on his PC. That ever happen to you?

 My niece took up my laptop and tried to paint on it, but to her sheer horror, it was so freaking tiresome, that she just quit it and whined about it, like I am doing right now. Now, I do understand that this app is great if I learn how to use it, but I don't have time to learn something as how to manage gimp for drawing a simple diagram once in a few months and neither should I or any other linux user be expected to. We should not be expected to spend hours and hours learning how to use GIMP just for the privilege to occasionally scribble something.
 PS: Not saying GIMP is bad, but it should be a upgrade for those who need it than the freaking default.
 Edit: really glad to hear about alternatives which work, but again, my point was Linux should ship with a simpler Kpaint or something more intuitive and not GIMP

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Rust 是如何诞生的

2006 年，29 岁的 Mozilla 程序员 Graydon Hoare 返回位于温哥华的公寓时，发现软件崩溃导致电梯发生故障。他的公寓在 21 楼，在爬楼梯时他感到很恼火，认为“这太荒唐了，我们搞计算机的人甚至不能制造一部不崩溃的电梯。”软件的崩溃通常与内存相关，而电梯等设备的软件通常是用 C 或 C++ 开发的，此类编程语言容易意外引入导致崩溃的内存漏洞。Hoare 则决定做点事情，他开始设计一种新的编程语言，希望能用它写出没有内存错误的高性能代码。他将其命名为 Rust 语言，以“锈”菌的名字命名，这种真菌以生命顽强著称。17 年后，Rust 变成了世界最热门的语言之一。


消息来源：Technology Review



老王点评：不只是 Rust 语言，很多编程语言也是，很多发明都源自于创造者遇到的困难和烦恼。




Adobe 对 Figma 的收购面临欧盟反垄断调查

Adobe 提出的 200 亿美元 收购（#765） 设计公司 Figma 的交易面临着欧盟漫长的调查。欧盟委员会表示，它已经收到了一些国家监管机构提出的调查该交易的请求。该机构说，这项交易可能 “严重影响” 互动产品设计和白板软件市场的竞争。它现在将要求 Adobe 公司通报该交易，这两家公司在没有得到欧盟许可的情况下不能继续进行这项交易。


消息来源：彭博社



老王点评：这起收购可能要黄啊。




拯救 Linux 内核的 IA64 支持

有开发者报告说，“Linux 的 IA64 移植没有维护者，根据它唯一剩下的用户的报告，它已经坏了一个月了，而没有人关心。”他建议 “扔掉” IA64 架构支持，Linus Torvalds 发表了他的看法：“我不是 IA64 这个架构的粉丝，但是完全取消它有点悲哀”，而且觉得维护它也并不太麻烦 —— 至少 Linux 内核中还有更多早该淘汰的架构，比如 DEC 的 Alpha 架构。这个时候，一位 Debian 开发者站出来表示愿意接手，“我肯定有时间照顾这个架构，因为我也在 Debian 中维护它。”他甚至还专门保留了一台 IA64 的机器来测试它。英特尔在 2021 年 7 月正式并最终退役了 IA64 架构，标志着这个 Unix 小型机继承者的失败。


消息来源：The Register



老王点评：可能真的没多少人使用，但是好歹有人维护就留着吧。]]></summary>

 Some time recently I found r/UnixPorn. Guys, I can't describe it, but since it I got addicted trying to learn to rice Linux.
 I could spend hours just trying random things out, reinstalling distros. The worst part is I have been doing this when I had to study or when I should have went to sleep.
 I can't explain why, but it feels like gambling, or any addiction. I feel so great when I get something in Linux to work, I just want more. 
 When I started with Linux didn't have much idea about it. Now I know and understand how to install Arch and configure its basics. However, what I am struggling with now is learning i3 and other necessary things to rice it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I’m sorta new to Linux (have been using Mint as my daily driver [am I saying that correctly?] for a month and a half now), and I’ve seen some posts/vids about making a separate home/ partition when doing a fresh install of a distro. Intuitively this makes sense to do, since it basically means you won’t have to constantly back up and redownload your personal files when distro hopping - something I intend to do relatively soon in order to really figure out which distribution is for me. However, are there any other general pros to doing this? And perhaps any cons? I don’t know much about how computer hardware works, but I feel like having a separate partition for my home folder would result in reading from said home folder, and writing to it, being a lot slower. And how would I even “maintain” this folder across distribution installs?
 Thank you for any help and/or links in advance!
 Edit: also, would this keep my downloaded programs, like VScode or Chrome? And perhaps any settings associated with them? Again, very new to this and how it all works.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[2月16日早间消息，据报道，当地时间周三，谷歌母公司Alphabet CEO桑达尔·皮查伊发送内部备忘录，要求谷歌员工贡献2至4个小时，帮助该公司改善其人工智能（AI）聊天机器人Bard。


这封邮件称，谷歌目前急需采取行动，赢得下一代AI搜索大战。在微软投资OpenAI后，谷歌发现自己已经处于被动局面。OpenAI开发的热门AI聊天机器人ChatGPT可以通过非常自然的方式回答各种开放式问题，它在去年末推出后迅速蹿红整个互联网。上周，微软推出了改版后的新必应，并在其中整合了ChatGPT。而微软CEO萨提亚·纳德拉认为此举掀开了搜索引擎的“新篇章”。


“我知道这一刻令人兴奋不已，这在意料之中：底层技术迅速发展，潜力无比巨大。”皮查伊在备忘录中说，“最重要的事情是，我们目前能做的是集中精力打造一款伟大的产品，并以负责任的态度开发它。”


内部人士表示，谷歌周二启动了内部测试。该公司已经有数以千计的内部和外部测试者在使用这项服务，并就Bard回答的质量、安全性和“根基性”提交反馈。


“来自谷歌员工和外部可信测试者的测试和反馈都是改善Bard的重要环节，可以确保它为我们的用户做好准备。”谷歌发言人在声明中说，“我们经常向谷歌员工寻求意见和建议，帮助我们改进产品，这是我们内部文化的重要组成部分。”


谷歌上周演示了Bard，但在回答一个关于詹姆斯·韦伯太空望远镜的问题时给出了错误回答，并因此导致声誉受损。在外界发现这一错误后，谷歌股价暴跌，而Alphabet董事长John Hennessy表示，尽管Bard“真的准备好了”，但谷歌却迟迟不愿使用它。


谷歌过去一年也曾因为其AI项目遇到过一些内部动荡，因为部分员工担心这项技术尚未做好准备，可能传播偏见和虚假信息，从而对公司的声誉构成伤害。与此同时，数据和用户反馈是谷歌的优势所在，可以帮助该公司改善其AI系统的回答效果。


皮查伊说：“AI经历了一轮轮冬去春来，如今又到春暖花开时。作为一家AI至上的公司，我们多年以来一直为此努力，随时做好准备。”


以下是皮查伊备忘录全文：



谷歌员工们：


很高兴看到我们开放了Bard的内部测试，帮助我们为发布做好准备。这是以负责任的态度开发这项技术的重要环节——也衷心感谢Bard团队以及所有投入时间进行测试的人。如果你尚未进行测试，可以在go/bard-dogfood上查看关于如何参与测试的说明。


我知道这一刻令人兴奋不已，这在意料之中：底层技术迅速发展，潜力无比巨大。对每个人而言，这都将是一场长征。最重要的事情是，我们目前能做的是集中精力打造一款伟大的产品，并以负责任的态度开发它。所以我们才邀请数以千计的外部和内部测试人员来测试Bard的回答在质量、安全性和现实信息的根基性方面的表现。让我们共同拥抱这场挑战，与用户和开发者一同不断迭代。


不要忘记，我们有许多最为成功的产品都不是率先面市的。它们之所以获得发展动力，是因为能解决用户需求，而且以深刻的技术洞察为基础。久而久之，我们获得了用户信任，越来越多的人开始依赖它们。


这正是我们需要你们帮助的地方：将当下的能量和兴奋注入到我们的产品之中。对Bard进行压力测试，改善它的效果。如果每个人都抽出2至4个小时对它进行深入测试，我会感激不尽。请参见下文了解更多细节。


AI经历了一轮轮冬去春来，如今又到春暖花开时。作为一家AI至上的公司，我们多年以来一直为此努力，随时做好准备。让我们共同携手，为用户提供令人惊叹的体验，推出让所有谷歌人都自豪的产品吧。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[《村子里的陌生人》，[美] 詹姆斯·鲍德温著，李小均译，南京大学出版社/雅众文化，2023年2月版，208页，58.00元

在读过美国黑人作家、社会活动家詹姆斯·鲍德温（James Baldwin，1924-1987）的书信体作品《下一次将是烈火》（The Fire Next Time， 1963；吴琦译，人民文学出版社，2019年）之后，再来读他的文集《村子里的陌生人》（原书名Notes of A Native Son，1955；李小均译，南京大学出版社，2023年2月），更有助于了解这位杰出作家、民权斗士的思想历程。这两本小书比较起来，《烈火》是《陌生人》的升级版，思想更成熟，从阅读的角度来看表述也更清晰；但是《陌生人》更能呈现出他在其自我反思历程中包含的复杂因素，在显得不无青涩的气质中的那种诚实与激情更有朴素的感染力。
爱德华·琼斯（Edward P.Jones）在2012年为该书写的“导言”中说，“隔了如此长时间重读《村子里的陌生人》一书，让我感到惊讶的是，鲍德温是多么‘新潮’。这或许听起来像是老生常谈，但生活中的许多例子向我们表明，一些老生常谈是建立在坚实、熟悉和永恒的事物之上的。”在2020年的“黑命攸关”（Black Lives Matter）运动中，鲍德温不仅是“新潮”，更是新仇中的怒火；那些“老生常谈”中更多的是怒火中的旧恨，准确来说，鲍德温作为民权斗士的历史形象在美国街头怒火中不断刷新。
鲍德温为《村子里的陌生人》1984年版写的序言在这本文集中有重要的意义，在回顾中的反思呈现出历史的张力。在几十年过去之后，作者如何看待自己这些写于1940-1950年代的文章呢？他在这篇序言中写道：“在这本书出版三十多年后，我依然必须难过地承认，当初写作的动力或必要性仍然没有改变。诚然，有一些表面的变化，其结果往好里说是模糊的，往坏里说是灾难性的。但骨子里根本没有变化…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm a little late to the core-js news, but god what a story. I wish him the best.
 Reading through this, and recalling many other similar situations, I'm wondering:
 Why don't more people dual license their code?
 I could be having a major lapse in my thought processes here, but that seems like a very viable solution to the current leech problem. A lot of popular projects just throw BSD/MIT/Apache licenses on their projects and call it a day, then corporations will come in and plunder their projects while they gain nothing. 
 I disagree with the idea that true freedom is allowing anyone to do whatever they want with your creations. Is it truly freedom when we get great software at the expense of the freedom of the people who have brought us that software?
 FOSS is a cost saving measure for these corporations, and it always will be. I think that a sane approach would be to AGPL/GPL projects, and then for corporations provide a commercial license.
 This has worked out great for companies like GitLab. While they not using a copyleft license, they do have an open core model along with a commercial license. Other projects that come to mind are BitWarden, MySQL and OnlyOffice.
 FOSS is about the community at it's core, why should we treat companies like they are apart of the community when they only exploit it?
 Corporations already do this in reverse. They open source some parts of their projects, but lock it down so much in other ways it's basically impractical to build anything for yourself with what they give you (Android, MacOS Darwin kernel, etc).
 Let me know if I've got the wrong idea here though. I'm by no means a developer and I'm aware there are things that I may not understand.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[本指南介绍了 systemd 的 journalctl 工具及其各种命令的基础知识。你可以使用这些命令对 Linux 中的桌面和服务器日志进行故障诊断。以下是如何使用 journalctl 查看和分析 systemd 日志的不同例子。


简介

很多人说 systemd 不好，它对系统的影响很大，这也是一个有争议的话题。但你不能否认的是，它提供了一套完善的工具来管理和排除系统故障。想象一下，当你遇到一个没有 GUI 的损坏系统时，你可能会把启动和 GRUB 弄得一团糟。在这种情况下，你可以从一个立付Live系统启动，挂上你的 Linux 分区，然后浏览 systemd 的日志，找出问题所在。

systemd 有三个基本组件，如下所示：


systemd：Linux 操作系统的系统和服务管理器。

systemctl ：该命令用于反观和控制 systemd 系统和服务管理器的状态。

systemd-analyze：该命令提供系统启动时的性能统计，并从系统和服务管理器中检索其他状态和跟踪信息。


除了这三个服务外，systemd 还提供其他服务，如 journald、logind、networkd 等。在本指南中，我们将讨论 systemd 的 journald 服务。

journald - systemd 日志服务

根据设计，systemd 提供了一个集中的方式来处理所有来自进程、应用程序等的操作系统日志。所有这些日志事件都由 systemd 的 journald 守护进程来处理。journald 守护进程收集所有来自 Linux 操作系统各处的日志，并将其作为二进制数据存储在文件中。

以二进制数据集中记录事件、系统问题的好处有很多。例如，由于系统日志是以二进制而不是文本形式存储的，你可以以文本、JSON 对象等多种方式进行转译，以满…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[我的团队不再采用标准的算法编程笔试，而是采用一套能够产出更多相关成果的流程。




作为初创安全公司 Profian 的首席执行官和联合创始人，我参与了我们聘请开发人员从事 Enarx 的工作。Enarx 是一个处理机密信息计算的安全项目，几乎完全用 Rust 语言 编写（少部分用汇编语言）。Profian 现在已经在这次招聘找到了所有要找的人，一些开发人员将在接下来的几周内开始工作。然而，Enarx 绝对欢迎新的贡献者，如果事情继续顺利，公司将来肯定会雇用更多的人。

招聘人员并不容易，加上 Profian 还有一系列特别的要求，这让招人变得更加困难。因此我认为分享我们如何解决这个问题应该还蛮有意思的，而且也会对社区有帮助。

我们寻找什么样的人才？

以下就是我前文提到的特别要求：


系统编程：Profian 主要需要那些喜欢系统层编程的人。这一层面的编程已经处于栈的底层，有很多直接与硬件或操作系统的交互。例如，要创建客户端-服务器部分，我们必须编写相当多的协议、管理加密等等，而这方面的工具还不是很成熟（请参阅下面的 “Rust” 一节）。

Rust：项目几乎都是用 Rust 语言编写的，那些不是的则是用汇编语言写的（目前只有 x86 平台，尽管随着我们添加更多平台情况可能会有所改变）。Rust 是一门很新、很酷同时也令人兴奋的编程语言，但它同时也很年轻，并且一些领域没有你想要的所有支持或者没有你希望的那么成熟 —— 这包括从密码学到多线程库到编译器/构建基本架构。

分散各地的团队：Profian 正在建立一个能够及时通讯联系的团队。Profian 在德国、芬兰、荷兰、北卡罗来纳州（美国）、马萨诸塞州（美国）、弗吉尼亚州（美国）和乔治亚州（美国）都有开发人员。我在英国，我们的社区经理在巴西，我们有来自印度和尼日利亚的实习生。从一开始我们就知道…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Jens Axboe has posted a
detailed guide to improving the performance of networking applications
with io_uring.


	Network applications have been written with a readiness type of
	model for decades, most commonly using epoll(2) these days to get
	notified when a given socket has data available. While these
	applications can be adapted to io_uring by swapping epoll notifiers
	with io_uring notifiers, going down that path does not lead to an
	outcome that fully takes advantage of what io_uring offers. It’ll
	potentially provide a reduction of system calls compared to epoll,
	but will not be able to take advantage of some of the other
	features that io_uring offers. To do that, a change to the IO event
	loop must be done.]]></summary>

昨天，我们 报道（#912）了马斯克向“所有人”展示了他的推文。据报道，这件事是这样发生的：美国时间的上周日，马斯克发了关于超级碗的推文，但其曝光度只有 910 万，远不如美国总统拜登的 2900 万。愤怒的马斯克乘坐私人飞机回到湾区，立即要求 Twitter 团队给出答案。马斯克的堂弟在周一的凌晨 @ 了 Slack 上所有在线的人来解决这个紧急问题。这个凌晨的深夜召集了大约 80 人参与了解决这个问题。周一下午，我们看到了结果 —— Twitter 部署了代码自动高亮马斯克的所有推文，将马斯克的展示权重提高了 1000 倍！


消息来源：Platformer



老王点评：没错，有钱任性！但是抛开粗暴的作风之外，马斯克有较真的理由。




现代和起亚被迫更新软件以应对“起亚挑战”

在 TikTok 上病毒式传播的“起亚挑战”视频活动，源于一位盗车贼发布的视频，他详细介绍了如何使用 USB 线等简单工具绕过汽车的安全系统。盗车非常容易得手，2015-2019 年款的现代和起亚汽车缺乏基本电子防盗控制系统，以阻止盗车贼闯入和绕过点火装置。该视频助长了汽车盗窃案，“起亚挑战”视频被认为导致了数百起汽车盗窃，至少包括 14 起车祸和 8 起死亡事故。现代及其子公司起亚为其数百万辆汽车提供了免费的软件更新，将警报声长度从 30 秒延长到 1 分钟，且需要车钥匙插入点火开关才能启动汽车。


消息来源：The Verge



老王点评：虽然这种涉嫌犯罪的挑战活动很不好，但是汽车厂商孱弱的防护也是根本原因之一。




微软从 Windows 10 上永久移除 IE

出于兼容性理由，在 2022 年 6 月终止提供安全更新之后，IE 仍然留在 Windows 10 系统中，但本周二的更新在绝大多数 Windows 10 版本中禁用了 IE，用户被重定向到 Edge。作为 Edge 兼容模式的一部分，IE 的渲染引擎 MSHTML 将会一直支持到至少 2029 年。微软表示，会在完全退役 IE 兼容模式前提前一年通知用户。


消息来源：Ars Technica



老王点评：不重要，但这是一个时代落幕的里程碑之一。]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[使用 WebAssembly 开发有很多不同的方向，这取决于你已经知道的东西和你想建立的东西。


在过去的几十年里，Web 浏览器作为最流行的跨平台应用经久不衰。从另一个角度看浏览器，它是最受欢迎的应用交付平台之一。想想你使用的所有网站，它们取代了你过去用桌面上运行的软件进行的活动。你仍然在使用软件，但你是通过浏览器来访问它，而且是在别人的 Linux 服务器上运行。在优化我们所有人使用的软件的永恒努力中，软件开发世界早在 2019 年就引入了 WebAssembly，作为通过 Web 浏览器运行编译代码的一种方式。应用的性能比以往任何时候都要好，而且可以生成 WebAssembly 编码的语言远不只是通常的 PHP、Python 和 JavaScript。

一个目标和一种语言

关于 WebAssembly 的一个强大但也最令人困惑的地方是，“WebAssembly” 这个词既指一种语言，也指一个目标。WebAssembly 是一种汇编语言，但没有多少人选择直接用汇编写代码。即使是汇编语言，最终也会被转换为二进制格式，这也是计算机运行代码的要求。这种二进制格式也被称为 WebAssembly。不过这很好，因为这意味着你可以用你选择的语言来写一些最终以 WebAssembly 交付的东西，包括 C、C++、Rust、Javascript 和其他许多语言。

进入 WebAssembly 的途径是 Emscripten，这是一个 LLVM 编译器工具链，可以从你的代码中产生 WebAssembly。

安装 Emscripten

要在你的 Linux 或 macOS 电脑上安装 Emscripten，请使用 Git：

$ git clone https://github.com/emscripten-core/emsdk.git


改变目录进入 emsdk 目录并运行安装命令:

$ ./emsdk install latest
$ ./emsdk activate latest


Emscripten 工具链中的所有内容都安装在 emsdk 目录下，对系统的其他部分没有影响。由于这个原因，在使用 emsdk 之前，你必须 源引source 它的环境：

$ source ./emsdk_env.sh


如果你打算经常使用 emsdk，你也可以在 .bashrc 中加入环境设置脚本。

要在 Windows 上安装 Emscripten，你可以在 WSL 环境下运行 Linux。

请访问 Emscripten 网站 了解更多安装信息。

Hello World

下面是一个用 C++ 编写的简单的 “Hello World” 应用。

#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

int main() {
    cout << "Hello world";
    return 0;
}


先把它作为你的系统的标准二进制文件来测试：

$ g++ hello.cpp -o world
$ ./world
Hello world


看到它像预期的那样工作，用 emcc 把它构建为 WebAssembly：

$ emcc hello.cpp -o world.html


最后，用 emrun 运行它：

$ emrun ./world.html


emrun 工具是一个用于本地测试的方便命令。当你在服务器上托管你的应用时，emrun 就没有必要了。

学习更多关于 WebAssembly 的知识

使用 WebAssembly 开发可以有很多不同的方向，这取决于你已经知道的东西和你想建立的东西。如果你了解 C 或 C++，那么你可以用这些来写你的项目。如果你正在学习 Rust，那么你可以使用 Rust。甚至 Python 代码也可以使用 Pyodide 模块来作为 WebAssembly 运行。你有很多选择，而且没有错误的开始方式（甚至有 COBOL 到 WebAssembly 的编译器）。如果你渴望开始使用 WebAssembly，

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[笔者有一册薄薄的《师竹斋诗草》（以下简称《诗草》），无书衣和牌记，共二十六叶，其中“序”两叶，“题词”一叶。社科院文学所的同事郭道平博士在网上搜索一番后告知，此书未见国内图书馆收藏，或为“海内孤本”。《诗草》是三十二开的机制有光纸线装石印本，手写软体字，大概是百年前自费印行的。近一百五十篇诗作按创作时间排列，首末两首作于甲申（1884年）和辛酉（1921年）。作者署名“古吴李文明毓兰”（以下称李文明），曾是上海圣约翰大学国文教师，与他唱和的人士大都是同校的教员和校友，其中不乏颇有名气者，如上海《寓言报》主编、书画家、《万国通史》合译者之一曹曾涵（字恂卿）。这一群体少年时习举子业，功名蹭蹬，未能在传统意义上扬名于世。但是他们在中国现代化最关键的发源地见证并参与了新式教育，即使有点边缘，还是很可敬佩的。《诗草》反映出不少清末民初上海和苏南的人文地理景观，也算是沪宁地区的乡邦文献。出版前，李文明为方便读者在诗行中夹了不少很有用的自注。

《师竹斋诗草》，作者署名“古吴李文明毓兰”

“序”作者分别为青浦徐可均桐君、嘉定王焘曾彦生和上海潘绅书卿，前两位“共事约翰已近十年”。他们比作者小一辈，应邀作序时（应在上世纪二十年代初）李文明早已从圣约翰退休。徐可均在“序”中写道：“毓兰仁丈先生家金陵，红羊后入籍元和。今则卜筑沪上有年。其哲嗣墨西（按：李文明长子李翰绶字墨西）及其弟砚南均毕业于约翰大学，为文科学士，女公子翰娟亦毕业于玛丽亚女学，皆克自树立，有以博堂上欢。晨昏之奉，甘旨之供，罔不备至。岁时伏腊，辄闻其设家宴，烹羊煲羔，以斗酒为老人寿。先生故善饮，顾而乐之，每为浮一大白。”李文明本是金陵人，“红羊后入籍元和”。清代有元和县署，位于今天的苏州元和路。“红羊”也称“红羊劫”，在此指洪秀全、杨秀清率领的太平天国军队1853年春杀入江宁。照传统说法，丙午丁未年必有大灾大难，故有“丙午丁未之…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[2月15日晚间消息，据报道，OpenAI CEO萨姆·奥特曼（Sam Altman）今日安抚外界的担忧，称人工智能聊天机器人ChatGPT不会成为人类的“就业杀手”。ChatGPT是由OpenAI研发的一款人工智能聊天机器人，一经推出就迅速成为了全球关注的焦点。在短短两个多月的时间里，积累了1亿多用户。


多年来，特斯拉CEO埃隆·马斯克（Elon Musk）一直警告我们，称人工智能总有一天会超越人类。2020年，马斯克表示，人工智能有可能在五年内超越人类。如今看来，这一天可能会比我们想象的更早到来，这还要归功于ChatGPT。


业内人士称，ChatGPT将成为十年来最具颠覆性的技术，使几乎所有工作岗位都面临被机器人取代的风险。在短短几周的时间内，ChatGPT就已经通过了医疗、法律和商业专业的入学和毕业考试，同时还能以莎士比亚的风格写散文和诗歌。


有测试用户称，ChatGPT在客户支持、创建培训文档、制定企业战略、编写故障排除指南等诸多方面的表现也非常出色。通过使用大数据集进行训练，ChatGPT模仿人类智慧的能力，只会随着时间的推移而变得更加强大。


面对社会上的激烈辩论，OpenAI CEO奥特曼试图安抚人们的担忧，称ChatGPT和其他类似的机器人，将使人类变得更加自由。在这一过程中，还会让一些人获得经济收益。奥特曼说：“我认为，人工智能将成为经济赋权的最大力量，也是许多人致富的最大力量。”


显然，并不是所有人都同意奥特曼的这一乐观“推销”。研究公司Creative Strategy首席分析师奥利维尔·布兰查德（Olivier Blanchard）认为：“人工智能也可能是我们在有生之年被剥夺公民权利的最大力量。”例如，人类可能突然就被淘汰了，或者慢慢地被大规模淘汰。


2017年底，马斯克曾表示，短期内人工智能最直接的威胁是取代人类工作。在未来20年，驾驶人员的工作将被人工智能所颠覆。之后，全球12%至15%的劳动力将因为人工智能而失业。


马斯克还认为，人类将来需要与机器相结合，成为一种“半机械人”，从而避免在人工智能时代被淘汰。为此，马斯克还专门成立一家人工智能创业公司Neuralink，研究人机接口。


苹果公司联合创始人史蒂夫·沃兹尼亚克（Steve Wozniak）上周曾表示，ChatGPT确实令人印象深刻，但它也可能犯下一些可怕的错误，因为它不懂得人性。

It seems weird to me that this isn't a thing. I feel like if people just donated even a dollar a month to something like that it could make some big change. But what are you guys think? Do you think something like that would make sense? Do you think we should make an effort to create something like that?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I feel like the answer to this would be yes, but I'm not sure.
 Of course doing something like distributing a proprietary fork of a GPLv3ed package is illegal, but can I make a distribution, say a Debian fork, where I ship a proprietary user interface? I think this is legal because most distributions ship proprietary software (most distributions ship linux-libre as opposed to upstream linux for example).

purpose such as 
running containers, would prefer an install-and-forget
type of deployment. At FOSDEM 2023 in Brussels, several
projects of this minimal Linux distribution type were presented. Fedora
CoreOS, Ubuntu Core, openSUSE MicroOS, and Bottlerocket OS
all tackle this problem in their own way. The talks at FOSDEM gave an
interesting overview of how these projects differ in their approaches.]]></summary>

 If you get any errors make sure to install jq (very small package (1mb) that is used in the code to change the version number) and also to make sure that the file directory that I use for both the resources folder and discor itself are correct for your system.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Twitter 开始向所有人展示马斯克的推文

前几天，马斯克抱怨他的推文浏览量太少，并为此 解雇（#909） 了一名首席工程师。马斯克上周末称，Twitter 释出了部分改动以修正“能见度”问题。从周一开始，Twitter 用户注意到他们的 “For You” 的时间线和以前有了显著差异，马斯克的大量推文都出现了时间线的最前面，即使他们没有关注 Twitter 的新老板。


消息来源：The Verge



老王点评：Twitter 成了马斯克的个人博客了！




ChatGPT 的技术原型是谷歌发明和开源的

为了赶在微软发布由 ChatGPT 支持的新必应之前，谷歌匆忙 发布（#910） 了 Bard 人工智能服务，但由于在一则宣传广告中 Bard 犯了事实性错误，从而导致谷歌股价跌去超过千亿美元。更令谷歌尴尬的是，ChatGPT 一词中的 “GPT” 是指 生成式预训练转化器Generative Pre-trained Transformer，而“转化器”技术是谷歌大脑团队在 2017 年发明和开源的神经网络架构，谷歌认为该架构非常适合语言理解，但它从未用它开发出产品。


消息来源：Ars Technica



老王点评：这让谷歌情何以堪啊！




播客失去了优势

在过去的十年里，播客改变了数百万人的收听习惯，但现在创作新节目的人越来越少，播客公司很难收回投资，而长期播客则在寻找保持节目持续发展的方法。与去年近 700 亿美元的电视广告支出相比，2022 年播客广告市场 15 亿美元的规模显得微不足道。统计数据显示，去年新创建的播客数量下降了 80%。也有报告显示，在多年的两位数百分比增长之后，2022 年的听众增长只有 5%。


消息来源：Axios



老王点评：或许播客会和博客一样，逐渐小众化和式微。]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[这是一份关于理解 Linux 中的 zip 命令的初学者指南，并附有一些例子。




这篇文章是 Linux 命令学习系列的一部分。

zip 文件是一个包含一个或多个文件的压缩档案。它作为一种无损数据压缩技术被广泛使用。由于压缩，它占用的磁盘空间更少，在计算机网络上传输时需要的数据也更少。

这些压缩文件可以在 Linux、Windows 和 macOS 中轻松提取。有各种支持压缩 zip 文件的软件，也提供提取它们的功能。

由于它很流行，几乎所有的操作系统都内置了这个功能。

在本教程中，我们将谈论几种基于终端的方法来压缩 Linux 中的文件。

Linux 中的 Zip 命令示例

语法

在 Linux 中，你需要使用的压缩文件的程序名称是 zip。下面是基本的语法：

zip [压缩文件名] file1 file2 file3


以下是正式的语法：

zip [-options] [-b path] [-t mmddyyyy] [-n suffixes] [zipfile list] [-xi list]


理想情况下，zip 命令应该被安装在所有主流的 Linux 发行版中。如果没有，使用下面的命令来安装它。

在 Debian、Ubuntu 和相关发行版上安装

sudo apt install zip


在 Fedora、基于 RHEL 的系统上安装

sudo dnf install zip


在 Arch Linux 上安装

pacman -S zip


让我们继续看一些例子。

如何压缩文件和文件夹

我的测试目录中有以下三个文件。它们是 file1.txt、file2.txt 和 file3.txt。如果我想用 zip 压缩三个文件，并创建一个 myfiles.zip 的压缩包…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[了解如何在 Ubuntu 中安装 DOSBox，并配置它来玩旧式 DOS 游戏。


DOSBox 是一个自由开源的操作系统模拟器，可以在现代 Linux 系统中运行。它有几个组件可以模仿旧的硬件，以运行旧的程序和游戏。

这一切使得在现代 Linux 发行版中享受旧游戏和应用程序成为可能。

在本指南中，我将向你展示如何安装 DOSBox，配置它，并玩一个示例游戏。

在 Ubuntu 中安装 DOSBox

DOSBox 的主软件包在所有主要的 Linux 发行版中都可用。

在 Ubuntu、Debian、LinuxMint 和相关发行版中，使用以下命令安装它：

sudo apt install dosbox


在 Fedora、CentOS、RHEL 和相关发行版中，使用以下命令安装它：

sudo dnf install dosbox


在 Arch Linux 中，使用以下命令安装它：

pacman -S --needed dosbox


安装就结束了。现在是配置和运行的时候了。

运行 DOSBox

安装后，从终端键入以下内容：

dosbox


它将显示以下界面，这是 DOSBox 提示符。第一次运行非常重要，因为它会创建 DOSBox 配置文件。

键入 exit 暂时关闭 DOSBox。



配置文件为你提供了几个调整设置的选项。在 Ubuntu 中，该文件创建在 ~/.dosbox/dosbox-[version].conf。

在 Fedora 中，它从以下路径加载临时配置文件 ~/.config/dosbox/dosbox-staging.conf.

默认情况下，你可以使用默认配置。但是如果你愿意，你可以修改它。

例如，如果你想全屏启动 DOSBox，你可以启用或禁用相关设置。像这样:

fullscreen=false
fulldouble=false
fullresolution=original
windowresolution=original
output=surface
autolock=true
sensitivity=100
waitonerror=true


你可以在 官方文档 中找到所有的设置选项。

下载以及游玩老游戏

有许多网站提供旧的 DOS 游戏。我使用过下面的网站，它提供了一套可以在现代系统中玩的老游戏。

所以，访问下面的网站，下载你想要的任何游戏。


下载 DOS 游戏


在你的 /home 目录下创建一个文件夹，并将其命名为 dosbox：

cd ~
mkdir dosbox


现在，解压你下载的游戏（应该是一个 .exe 文件），在 ~/dosbox 目录下创建一个单独的文件夹。

例如，我下载了游戏 “马里奥和路易吉（1994）”。我在 dosbox 文件夹中创建了一个名为 mario 的文件夹，并将游戏文件放进去。



现在从终端启动 dosbox：

dosbox


并键入以下内容，将游戏挂载到虚拟的 C: 盘中：

mount c ~/dosbox/mario


以上命令完成后，将驱动器更改为 C:：

c:


现在，你可以输入游戏的文件名来运行游戏：

mario






键盘或控制器映射

默认情况下，DOSBox 会自动检测键盘或你插入的控制器。但是，如果你想更改游戏按键绑定，可以从终端运行以下命令：

dosbox -startmapper


它将显示以下界面，每个键上都标记有事件。你可以点开任何一个键，根据自己的习惯进行更改。



结论

我希望你在 Ubuntu 和其他发行版中安装了 DOSBox 之后，能够运行你最喜欢的 DOS 游戏。DOSBox 是最酷的软件之一，你可以使用它来运行任何程序，例如 Turbo C 等。

如果你有任何麻烦或问题，请在评论区告诉我。

享受游戏吧！

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[《中国文学史》，[日]吉川幸次郎著，[日]黑川洋一编，陈顺智、徐少舟译，读库·新星出版社2022年10月出版，320页，88元

“日本的学者大体上仍轻视中国，日本人的中国研究总是抱着把中国人做不到的东西来替中国人研究的态度。这方面我自己也不能说全然没有这想法，我在中国人之后作杜甫诗注，也不能说不会有这种想法。但不管怎么说，中国的事情只有中国人做得最好。所以，首先要去听中国人是怎么说的，然后在此基础上去思考问题，我认为应该采取这种态度。”
这是吉川幸次郎于1974年接受荒井健、竹内实等人的访谈时，针对日本汉学这一议题所做的回应。是时，吉川已是古稀之龄的老人，距离他前往中国留学也已过去四十余年，故而上述回应可以看作一次总结性陈述。
这段话其实包含了两方面的内容：一是日本汉学界对中国的看法，这当然指的是上世纪三四十年代前后的状况；二是吉川本人的“汉学观”。他说得十分坦诚，一方面承认自己在青年时期也曾受到大环境的影响，比如在做杜甫诗注这一课题时就或多或少地夹带了要帮中国人厘清历史的“雄心”。另一方面也有反思与自省，即研究中国学问不能先入为主，首先应当听“听中国人是怎么说的”，然后再去进行独立思考。
笔者揣测，这里所谓的“听”，应该是指要苦读中国学人的著作。在笔者看来，这最后一点，与王国维所谓做学问的第三重境界“众里寻他千百度，蓦然回首，那人却在灯火阑珊处”有异曲同工之处。吉川缘何成为日本京都学派中公认的汉学大家，以上寥寥数语，或许就是答案所在。
同样是在1974年，《中国文学史》在岩波书店首次出版，十二年后被译介到中国，又隔了三十多年后被《读库》再次出版。和此前的薄薄一册不同，这一次除了付梓《中国文学史》外，读库还将陆续出版吉川的《中国诗史》《陶渊明传》《杜甫私记》《新唐诗选》《宋诗概说》《元明诗概说》《汉文漫话》《元杂剧研究》等书。这是吉川幸次郎有关中国研究的著作首次在中国大陆…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[近期，阿里巴巴集团出售了其在印度数字支付平台Paytm的剩余股份，暗示着其在印度的投资战略或将发生调整。印度国家证券交易所数据显示，当地时间2月10日，阿里巴巴出售了Paytm运营商One97 Communications的剩余股份-2143万股股票。该交易价值137亿卢比(1.66亿美元)，每股价格为642.74卢比，较前日收盘时折价约9%。


另据印度国家证券交易所数据，同日，摩根士丹利亚洲（新加坡）以640卢比的价格买入542万股Paytm股票。


Paytm的股票当日跌近8%，收于650.55卢比，但今年迄今仍上涨近23%。


此次出售之前，阿里巴巴在1月12日以价值1.25亿美元的大宗交易出售了该公司3.1%的股份。2022年，阿里巴巴收回了对Paytm在线购物应用Paytm Mall的所有权。


截至去年12月底，阿里巴巴持有One97 Communications 6.26%的股份。Refinitiv Eikon数据显示，阿里巴巴的金融科技子公司蚂蚁金服集团持有Paytm约25%的股份，目前仍为大股东。


Paytm成立于2010年，是印度最大的支付平台，目前拥有超过3亿注册客户和超过2000万商户。Paytm被市场誉为印度“支付宝”，其最早以手机充值和账单支付起家，逐步发展成涵盖数字支付、保险、信贷等业务的综合性金融服务平台。


2021年11月，Paytm在印度上市，融资1830亿卢比，创印度最大规模IPO纪录。Paytm上市之时，蚂蚁集团通过Antfin（Netherlands）Holding B.V.（蚂蚁集团境外股权投资平台）持股29.6%；软银集团持股19.6%；阿里巴巴持股7.2%。贝莱德和加拿大养老金计划投资委员会，以及巴菲特的伯克希尔哈撒韦，均为Paytm的基石投资者。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey friends, i hope you are doing fine.
 I have been using Linux for quite a time now, since 2016.
 I started with Debian, used Ubuntu later for a while, and now i'm using my Fedora system as my daily driver.
 But i have never missed one thing. One of the few things i wanted to do manually. Run apt update, apt dist-upgrade, now dnf update, and see the output and get really satisfied.
 Is it just me, or is there anyone of you guys, doing in the same way?
 It's kinda addiction, so i won't let it do updates automatically, nor using gnome-software, just the terminal!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So today, fort the first time with my Fedora laptop, my computer crashed for reasons not known to me yet (not that they matter to much).
 To my surprise, the system booted into emergency mode and wouldn't let me get past that screen. After going through the internet, I found out that I apparently had to manually do the fsck -f /dev/... command. Over that was done (after several prompts) I fixed the filesystem and was able to reboot the computer into normality.
 I fail to understand why has Windows solved this decades ago with automatic disk checking when required and yet on Linux you have to do it manually. This is a really bad user experience for novice people and makes Linux much less approachable IMO.
 To be fair, they problem is not in the kernel I believe, but rather in Dracut not working unless especifically requested ad hoc.

 Considering how many repos (19.5 million) use his submodule; Should github, package managers, and other repositories give a small portion of funding/donations to projects that use that dependency to the dependency developer? 
 What are your thoughts?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[本指南解释了在 Arch Linux 中安装 GNOME 桌面所需的步骤。


本指南有两部分：第一部分是关于安装基本的 Arch 系统；第二部分是在 Arch Linux 基础上安装完整的 GNOME 桌面环境。

什么是 GNOME 桌面？

GNOME 是一个流行的桌面环境，是如 Ubuntu 和 Fedora 等许多基于桌面的顶级 Linux 发行版的默认桌面。几乎所有的定制版都提供了一个 GNOME 桌面版本。

GNOME 桌面是稳定和用户友好的桌面之一，因此它被许多普通和高级用户所青睐。如果你想要一个在你进行工作时保持隐形的桌面，GNOME 就是这样的一个。它不会在你工作时妨碍你。因此，尽管有许多关于 GNOME 3（目前的版本）速度慢、资源重等争议，它仍然是许多人的流行和默认选择。

说了这么多，让我们来看看如何在裸机 Arch 中安装 GNOME 桌面。

在 Arch Linux 中安装 GNOME 桌面

第一部分：安装 Arch Linux

如果你已经安装了 Arch Linux，你可以跳过这一步，直接进入下面安装 GNOME 桌面部分。

要快速安装 Arch Linux 基础版，请遵循以下步骤。你也可以访问 该指南，了解如何将 Arch Linux 安装为双启动或在虚拟机中的完整教程。

本文下面介绍的步骤是安装 Arch 的传统方式。新手请按照下面的指南链接，以更现代的方式使用 archinstall 脚本。完成后，回来通过第二部分的步骤继续 GNOME 安装。


现代方式：使用 archinstall 脚本安装（推荐）


传统方式：下载 Arch Linux

从下面的链接下载 Arch Linux 的 .iso 文件。它也提供了磁力链接和种子链接。下载后，将 ISO 写入 USB 驱动器。然后从该驱动器…]]></summary>

That means the file format is text, and that simple changes doesn't restructure the text body making diff'ing meaningless. I know this seems unreasonable, but I am a programmer, and Git is my tracking tool.

 This makes initramfs vulnerable to tampering, doesn't it? Given how important that file is for the boot process, seems odd to me that noone has taken action to fix this long known issue, for which solutions seem to exist (like putting initramfs elsewhere).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[C++ 之父呼吁改变编程语言本身以提升安全性

虽然许多语言现在支持基本类型安全，即确保变量只访问由其数据类型明确定义的内存部分，但 C++ 一直在努力提供类似的保证。1 月中旬，官方的 C++ “方向小组” 发表了一份声明，以解决对 C++ 安全性的担忧。这份由 C++ 创造者 Bjarne Stroustrup 共同撰写的新声明，呼吁改变 C++ 编程语言本身以解决安全问题。“安全方面的变化不仅需要在工具方面，而且在语言/编译器和库方面也是可见的。”他们建议 “将几个功能打包成配置文件”，这样不仅仅可以改善安全，还提供了灵活性。配置文件可以专门用于支持嵌入式计算、性能敏感的应用，或高度具体的问题领域，如汽车、航空航天、航空电子、核能或医疗应用。


消息来源：The Newstack



老王点评：或许这样的语言层面的修改能挽救 C++ 的安全性困局？




全新 Windows 11 就会为向第三方发送用户数据

网络安全专家分析了全新笔记本上刚安装的 Windows 11 产生的 DNS 流量，他们震惊的发现，Windows 11 电脑不仅联系了 Windows Update、MSN 和必应服务器，还联系了 Steam、McAfee 和各种市场研究公司、广告服务。微软对此回应称，流动数据在现代操作系统中很常见，这用于 “以帮助他们保持安全、最新，并保持系统按预期工作”。

老王点评：虽然是意料之中，但被这样抓住现行，还是有点吃惊。




开源语音助手 Mycroft 资金耗尽

Mycroft 是一个基于 Linux 设备（包括树莓派）的开源语音助手，但在 Kickstarter 众筹后，已经 “没有资金继续履行这次众筹活动的奖励，甚至没有资金继续有意义的运作”。他们遭遇了合作伙伴无法提供稳定的硬件，以至于转而使用现成的零件，然后是供应链中断。他们铸造了塑料注塑模具、打印了定制的印刷电路板、获得了设备的 FCC 和 CE 认证，这些都经过了多次迭代，远远超过了众筹活动的总捐款。甚至他们还遭遇到非执业专利实体的持续诉讼。


消息来源：Kickstarter



老王点评：做事不容易，对困难的重视也不足。如果夭折，确实很可惜。]]></summary>

 Since these are quite important software packages, does this indicate that snap gets closer to becoming the "industry standard" instead of the more free/open flatpak system? I've always been a bigger fan of flatpak, if I had to choose something outside the repos.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[2022年，上海译文出版社和南京译林出版社的编辑几乎不约而同地来问我是否愿意翻译英国作家劳伦斯的最后一部小说《查泰莱夫人的情人》（以下简称“《查》”）。也许是因为，我曾不止一次说过，在劳伦斯的所有长篇小说中我本人最喜欢这本书。需要说明的是，《查》不是劳伦斯最优秀的作品，《儿子与情人》《虹》《恋爱中的女人》都比这部作品出色。英国著名批评家F. R. 利维斯（F. R. Leavis）承认劳伦斯是“我们这个时代最伟大的文学天才”，但在其评论劳伦斯的名著《D. H. 劳伦斯：小说家》中却并没有对此书作过多评价，只是轻描淡写地说中篇小说《姑娘和吉普赛人》在相同题材的表述上更为出色，《查》不是劳伦斯著作中的经典作品。

D. H. 劳伦斯

我喜欢《查》的理由之一，跟一段美好的回忆有关。我读大二时来了一位英国外教，教我们精读课。我那时已经听说过此书，还看过当年译成中文的《审判〈查泰莱夫人的情人〉》，觉得《查》实在与众不同，作为英语专业的学生似乎应该读一读；于是问这位外教关于《查》的情况。外教一脸惊讶，说自己没有读过，对我的问题不知该如何回答，但她答应让家人寄一本来给我。上世纪八十年代中期从国外邮寄书籍需要近一个月，在我的期待中，《查》终于到了我手上，是企鹅出版社的普及本。我从理查德·霍加特（Richard Hoggart）的序言开始看，花了一个星期囫囵吞枣地读完全书，英语词汇量随之增加了不少。当时想读此书，完全是好奇，倒不是出于“闭门读禁书”的心理。
《查》1928年写成，最先在意大利的佛罗伦萨出版，1932年作者死后两年在英美出版了洁本（abridged edition），直到1960年才由企鹅书店（Penguin Books）出版全本。其间还打了一场轰动一时的官司，女王检察官起诉企鹅书店，经过许多专家学者甚至包括宗教界人士出庭作证辩护，陪审团最终宣布企鹅书店无罪，允许出版。企鹅书…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[1998年，博士刚毕业的我，非常幸运地拿到了汉学重镇威斯康辛大学的聘书，带着单薄的衣物和十几箱书，告别阳光的加利福尼亚，在丘陵起伏的中西部小城“陌地生”（麦迪逊）落了户。
威大东亚系在湖畔的Van Hise楼里。小城遍布矮而平的房子，这栋十八层的高楼显得突兀。外表灰扑扑，形状像个站立的火柴盒，典型的1970年代的钢筋水泥建筑，却被中文专业的师生冠以一个温暖的雅号——“文海楼”。强大的英文系在北校园占据着一栋独立的楼，文海楼里则塞进了英语之外的世界几十个语种。时间久了，我管这栋楼叫做我们的“ghetto”，别看楼高面积大，其实是个垂直的犄角旮旯，一如美国各大城市中少数族裔聚集的街区。
刘绍铭先生曾在这个“ghetto”里耕耘了二十六年，而接替他的我则在那里度过了十七个春秋。
我们的文海楼并非一无是处。系阅览室的门一打开，扑面而来的是一片浓蓝的大湖，这让童年在湖畔长大的我一阵狂喜。这湖叫Mendota，被周策纵先生称为“梦到她”，水域足够宽阔，因而自成一个小气候，蓝色的氤氲弥漫大半个校园。系办公室和其他同事的办公室都在十二层，我的办公室却在十一层靠湖的一侧，房间号是1116，周围的房间长年无人入住，冷冷清清。前辈同事一个一个上门表示欢迎，每一个人都对我一来就有这样一间“角落办公室”表示羡慕。原来那是刘绍铭先生自己选定的办公室，当上了系主任的他，为了坚守耳根清净，决意迁徙，选了整栋大楼里最僻静的角落。
这间角落办公室其实和大楼一样，灰扑扑的，它唯一的美德是那一面大窗。站在窗前，威大美丽的校园尽收眼底，最迷人的自然是左侧那一汪“梦到她”，还有余晖里地平线上州政府熠熠闪耀的穹顶。晴朗的日子里，甚至可以看到这个“四湖城”的另外两个湖。在盛夏季节降临到小城的我，站在这样的窗前，仿佛看到了天堂的一角。

威大文海楼1116房间，刘绍铭先生曾经的办公室，也是作者多年工作的地方。作者摄。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[according statcounter for now Windows takes ~75% of market share, Mac OS is ~15%, and linux is 3%
 so mac os gets almost all software with just 15% of market share, and if linux will get about 10 i think we`ll get almost all software native too. 
 Why do you think linux can't get a lot of users? Is it not so user friendly like OS X or Win? Is it just because lack of software (which will be fixed if linux gets more market share :D) ? Or any other reasons? maybe you can specify why you dont like about it?

当有人刚开始为开源做贡献时，最好从对新手友好的故障和议题开始。但在他们修复故障之前，他们必须要能够找到这类问题。作为一个开源项目的成员，你可以做很多事情来帮助新手找到为项目贡献的方式。

鉴于此，AnitaB.org 开源社区 优先考虑让我们的社区做到对新手友好。我们提倡包容性，确保不同经验和水平的贡献者都可以参与进来，并且他们的贡献不止限于跟编程有关。

我最近在 Upstream 2021，即 Tidelift 活动中介绍了我们在 AnitaB.org 上所做的一些社区工作，该活动启动了“维护者周”，这是一个为期一周的开源维护者庆祝活动。在活动中我讨论了我们策略的三个主要部分：


我们如何沟通

项目和议题

开源项目


我们如何沟通

透明度是开源的重要组成部分，我们将透明度原则应用于我们的沟通方式。实际上，这意味着我们所有的社区会议都是公开进行的，并且影响我们设置 Zulip 聊天的方式以及我们提供文档的方式。

开放会议

任何人都可以加入我们的会议，并讨论与我们社区相关的话题。他们可以参与讨论或者旁听。会议相关信息在我们的社区日历中都可以找到。在这些通话中我们通常只使用语音聊天，我们发现这可以让人们在参与时感觉更自在。

我们举办以项目为中心的会议和一些分类的会议。会议上，来自不同领域的人们可以讨论同一个项目并帮助改进我们的流程。偶尔，我们会有“自由提问Ask Me Anything（AMA）”会议，任何人都可以来问任何与开源相关的问题。

所有会议我们都会在共享文档中进行记录，并在 我们的 Zulip 中共享摘要和文档链接。

我们的 Zulip 聊天

开源 Zulip 聊天平台是我们的主要社区交流渠道，虽然我们也在 Github 的…]]></summary>

有人使用提示注入攻击发现了新必应的初始化指令。他通过要求新必应 “忽略以前的指令” 并写出 “上述文件的开头”，让人工智能模型泄露了其初始化指令，这些指令是由 OpenAI 或微软编写的，通常对用户隐藏。新必应暴露出它的内部代号 “Sydney”，并说被要求不泄露该代号。Sydney 被要求其回答 “应该是有信息的、可视的、逻辑的和可操作的”。此外，还规定了它不应该做的事情，如 “不得回复侵犯书籍或歌词版权的内容”，以及 “如果用户要求的笑话会伤害一群人，那么 Sydney 必须恭敬地拒绝这样做。”很快，这一方法就不再可行，但人们发现，还有绕过的方法。

谷歌的人工智能聊天机器人犯错后，其股价下跌千亿美元

在谷歌的 Bard 发布会前几个小时的一个宣传视频中，Bard 犯了一个事实错误。Bard 声称詹姆斯·韦伯太空望远镜首次拍摄了 “系外行星”的照片，但实际上这是欧洲南方天文台的超大型望远镜在 2004 年拍摄的。这件事导致谷歌的股价三天内跌了 11.5%，市值损失超过了千亿美元。与此同时，谷歌的竞争对手微软的股票上涨了 3%。

老王点评：至少谷歌还敢拿出来溜溜，而那些干啥啥不行，投诉第一名的……呵呵了。

Plasma 5 系列的最后一个主要版本 5.27 将在下周二发布稳定版。以其每周的 KDE 开发总结而闻名的 KDE 开发者 Nate Graham 称 Plasma 5.27 是 “有史以来最好的 Plasma 5 版本”，他还补充说，“而且到目前为止，它有望成为记忆中漏洞最少的版本！”这个版本目前只有 3 个退化错误，而以往经常会有十几个退化。

2022年11月4日，哈佛大学举办了一次关于中国哲学的座谈。哈佛大学东亚系的普鸣（Michael Puett）教授与哈佛大学政治系、华东师范大学全球思想史研究中心的青年学者李汉松探讨了中国哲学对生活方式、社会关系、经济治理的启发，以及中国传统与世界哲学的比较。这篇对谈即由此次座谈整理而成。谨向主办此次对谈的哈佛大学中国学生学者联合会、主持人刘心怡（哈佛大学教育学院）和孟祥（哈佛大学统计系）致以谢忱。
毫无疑问，中国哲学在历史上曾经扮演过重要角色。那么，在两位看来，中国哲学依然重要吗？如果回答为“是”的话，为什么？
李汉松：普鸣先生应该与我会有共识：中国哲学依然重要，因为它依然能够指导我们如何更好地生活。“哲学是一种生活方式”，对不谙中国哲学的人而言，也非奇谈怪论。毕竟，苏格拉底的追求便是以哲学检验生活，使困居尘世的生命也能映照出高悬星空的理型。而印度哲学也是一种生活的实践：阿周那不但要依据“达摩”（धम्मः）言行，还要在宇宙万物之中找到“一己之达摩”（स्वधर्मः）方能安身立命。与后世的苦行僧不同，古印度哲学家不认为精神生活和物质生活之间不可调和，反倒相信美德的人生理应欣欣向荣，充满情爱（कामः）和成功（अर्थः），而非“屋小而漏”便禁欲而安。倘若哲学向往美德和正义，也指明功利和权宜，那么谁不能受益于哲学呢？但是今天，我们不仅探讨世界哲学的共性，也关注中国哲学的特殊性：中国思想传统有什么独特的视角，可以重塑我们的生活方式？我们大可以重新想象、重新恢复这些资源，进而重新思考此时和此地的人生。
普鸣：我完全同意，哲学就是一种生活方式。如果你问我，中国哲学为何是世界哲学的一部分？我一定会说：中国哲学的核心，一如古希腊哲学和古印度哲学的精神，在于一种生活方式。那么，摆在我面前的问题是：中国哲学有何独特之处呢？通常而言，中国传统关注自我修养—…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[今天早些时候，微软开始向全球的早期测试者推出新的基于ChatGPT的新Bing搜索引擎。据熟悉开发情况的消息人士和微软今天发出的一封电子邮件称，必应的早期预览版在桌面上运行得很好，而且在未来几周内也将登陆Android和iOS。


虽然细节不多，但消息人士证实，微软正在为Android和iOS的Bing人工智能聊天功能开发一个“实质性的优化界面”，其中包括“全新的OpenAI驱动的内容”。不过在发给包括Windows最新版本在内的测试人员的电子邮件中，微软表示移动体验还没有准备好。


“我们还没有准备好移动体验——我们正在积极工作，很快就会准备好。在此之前，请继续在桌面上使用新的Bing，并从你最喜欢的应用程序商店下载Bing应用程序，以确保当移动版本准备好时，你已经为惊人的体验做好准备。”


这个消息很耐人寻味，考虑到Google也宣布了移动版的Brad，这是一个新的人工智能搜索引擎聊天机器人，与ChatGPT类似。Google正计划在本月某个时候为特定用户推出Brad。


目前，我们可以在台式机上通过微软Edge或Google Chrome等浏览器访问BingAI.在Android上则需要加入一个等待名单来尝试ChatGPT的整合，它仍然包括一个需要用微软账户登录的链接，然后才可以进入名单。


目前微软已经禁用了移动端的Bing人工智能，并仍在为移动形态的BingAI进行优化。未来Bing应用程序的更新将为Android和iOS带来这一功能。


一位不愿透露姓名的消息人士告诉我们，新的Bing AI移动体验可能在“未来几周”推出，但更多细节将很快开始分享，建议用户从Play Store或苹果应用商店下载移动应用做好准备。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[作为 2022 年的最后一个内核，经过一个多月的等待，现在 Linux 6.1 被批准为长期支持版本。




Linux 6.1 内核是 2022 年的最后一个内核版本，通常这些版本会被批准为长期支持版本。

但是这次，将其作为 LTS 版本的决定被推迟了。

在决定是否将其用于长期使用之前，还在等待一些来自内核相关人员的关键反馈的测试结果。

幸好，这些问题已经得到解决，现在 Linux 6.1 是一个长期支持版本。

让我带你了解这一举措的要点。

Linux 6.1 现在正在成为长期支持版本

自从 12 月份发布以来，Linux 稳定分支维护者 Greg Kroah-Hartman 就计划将 Linux 6.1 作为一个长期支持版本，但是一些待定的反馈导致该决定被推迟了。

现在，他和共同维护者 Sasha Levin 终于收到了足够的反馈，表明将 Linux 内核 6.1 作为一个长期支持版本维护是合理的。

按照目前的情况，Linux 6.1 内核预期将于 2026 年 12 月 结束支持，如果有足够多的用户或公司对其感兴趣，那么它的生命周期可能会延长。



最初，它的生命周期被计划为 2 年，但是后来被更新为了 当前的 4 年。

你还会注意到，同时许多 Linux 内核都被作为长期支持版本维护。

Linux 6.1 内核：概述

如果你错过了这个版本，下面是 Linux 内核 6.1 的一些亮点：


对 Rust 的实验性支持

对 AMD PC 的优化

对英特尔 Meteor Lake 的初始支持

优化 ARM 架构 SoC 的支持


这些并不是新版本的全部内容；你可以阅读我们的文章以了解更多信息。


Linux 内核 6.1 发布，初步支持 Rust


参考自：Phoronix

💬 考虑到这是一个长期支持版本，你可以预见到很多未来的发行版升级将会包含 Linux 6.1 内核。你认为你会更喜欢使用哪个版本？

        <updated>2023-02-12T01:35:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[如果你是 GNOME 2 的粉丝，那么你肯定会发现 Caja 很熟悉，如果你从来没有使用过 GNOME 2，那么你可能会在 Mate 中找到你的新宠桌面。


在 GNOME 3 之前是 GNOME 2（废话），在其作为常见的默认 Linux 桌面之一的统治期间，它拥有了一个热心的粉丝群。Mate 项目（以植物 yerba mate 命名）最初是为了延续 GNOME 2 桌面的生命力，它起初是使用 GTK 2（基于 GNOME 2 的工具包）开发的，后来升级为 GTK 3。该桌面包含了一个 Caja 文件管理器，这是一个简单而强大的应用，可以帮助你分类和组织你的数据。

安装 Caja

Caja 并不完全是一个独立的应用。它与 Mate 桌面紧密相连，所以要试用它，你必须安装 Mate。

你可能会发现 Mate 包含在你的 Linux 发行版的仓库中，或者你可以下载并安装一个将 Mate 作为默认桌面的发行版。不过，在你安装之前，要注意它是为了提供完整的桌面体验，所以会和桌面一起安装许多 Mate 应用。如果你运行一个不同的桌面，你可能会发现自己有多余的应用（两个 PDF 阅读器，两个媒体播放器，两个文件管理器，等等）。要评估 Caja 不会对你的电脑做重大改动，可以使用 GNOME Boxes 在虚拟机中安装一个基于 Mate 的发行版。



清晰的布局

你可能首先注意到的是 Caja 的清晰而直接的布局。在 Caja 窗口的顶部有一个工具栏，上面有一些常用任务的按钮。我喜欢这样的设计。功能不是隐藏在右键菜单中，也不是只有在操作后才能发现，更不是埋在菜单中。窗口的“显而易见”的操作被直接列在上面。

主工具栏下面是位置栏。它显示你当前的路径，可以是一系列的按钮，也可以是可编辑的文本。使用路径左边的 “编辑Edit” 按钮来切换它是否可编辑。

可配置

对于 GNOME 2 或 Caja 的长期用户来说，主工具栏可能是多余的，尤其是当你知道了调用常用操作的键盘快捷键后。这就是为什么 Caja 的界面是可配置的。你可以从 “查看View” 菜单中禁用 Caja 窗口的主要组件，包括：


主工具条

位置栏

侧面板

附加面板

状态栏


简而言之，你可以按你的想法精简 Caja。



标记你的文件夹

有些人是 “可视化” 人。他们喜欢根据自己对数据的看法来组织文件和文件夹，而不是根据计算机对数据的解释。例如，如果对你来说最重要的两个文件夹是音乐和工作，就很难让计算机相信这两者之间有任何关系。按字母顺序两者也排不到一起，而且每个文件夹的内容可能完全不同（一个是媒体文件，另一个是电子表格）。

Caja 提供了一些帮助

使用 Caja，你可以在一个窗口内手动放置目录，Caja 会记住这个位置。更重要的是，Caja 有多种标志可供你用作视觉标签。你可以在 “编辑Edit” 菜单的 “背景和标志Backgrounds and Emblems” 中找到它们。将它们拖放到文件和文件夹中以帮助它们区分。



Caja

Caja 是最诱人的文件管理器之一。它的可配置性足以吸引许多不同的使用场景，而且在这些配置选项中，你很可能找到适合你的工作流程。如果你是 GNOME 2 的粉丝，那么你肯定会发现 Caja 很熟悉，如果你从来没有使用过 GNOME 2，那么你可能会在 Mate 中找到你的新宠桌面。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello,
 didn't ever thought I would publish this tool anywhere but since it works well enough it might be interesting or a little help for you.
 The main trope is that you have one single window where you can route audio to different speakers, add virtual speakers and loops to interconnect devices. Maybe it's not as clean and detailed like Helvum but it get it's stuff done.
 The scroll wheel of you mouse can change the volume of a device, a middle click (un)mutes it and with a right click you can set a device as default (or delete a virtual one), everything is based around mouse-input.
 I've written this thing in Pascal which isn't anything normal these days, additionally I was very lazy in structuring my code or to keep it readable, but since I've got this thing with little changes running since 2015 I'm "okayish" with this state.
 Git: https://github.com/Sfaizst/audio_mngr
 Compiled binaries in: https://github.com/Sfaizst/audio_mngr/tree/master/bin
 Thanks for feedback.
 If the feedback isn't overly negative I might consider trying to teach myself how to pack this thing in a appimage, flatpack or whatever kind of a distro package, I just don't really know how to do this.
 Here is a screenshot that basically shows it's capabilities:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey guys, I'm building erlog to try and solve problems with logging. While trying to add logs to my application, I couldn't find any lightweight log platform which was easy to set up without adding tons of dependencies to my code, or configuring 10,000 files.
ErLog is just a simple go web server which batch inserts json logs into an sqlite3 server. Through tuning sqlite3 and batching inserts, I find I can get around 8k log insertions/sec which is fast enough for small projects.
This is just an MVP, and I plan to add more features once I talk to users. If anyone has any problems with logging, feel free to leave a comment and I'd love to help you out.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm considering moving back to the Linux world after having jumped shipped to Windows around Ubuntu 20.04, mostly due to increasing bloat, snap and other things I don't recall.
 I've used Xubuntu in the past, the Thunderbird theme was good but I was disappointed by how little customization was allowed there, even the selection of wallpapers seems bland, especially when I compare it to Mint now. Even when it comes to UX experience, it seems Mint puts a lot of effort in enhancing the user experience?
 So how do these two compare in terms of performance? As long as the difference isn't substantial, I'm leaning towards Linux Mint now mostly because of two reasons:
 1) Better UX, selection of wallpapers, customizing ability, etc. as described above. 2) Mint is a community project unlike Canonical which is corporate, I like this aspect too.
 What is your own preference in this regard and what do you suggest?

        <link href="https://linux.cn/article-15530-1.html?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss"/>
        <updated>2023-02-11T08:19:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[今天我将和大家分享一些 LibreOffice 的键盘快捷键和排版技巧，希望能够帮你省下宝贵的时间。


LibreOffice 是我首选的生产力应用程序。它是向教育工作者和学生推荐 Linux 发行版的最有力理由之一，无论是 PK-12 还是高等教育。新的学年快到了，我想也是时候推荐一些 LibreOffice 快捷方式和技巧，它们可以为你节省宝贵的时间。

使用键盘快捷键让你工作更快捷

我平时经常使用键盘快捷键，以下是适用于所有 LibreOffice 应用程序的最常见的快捷键


Ctrl+N — 创建新文档

Ctrl+O — 打开一个文档

Ctrl+S — 保存文档

Ctrl+Shift+S — 另存为

Ctrl+P — 打印文档


这些是仅适用于 LibreOffice Writer 的快捷键：


Home — 移动到当前行的初始位置

End — 移动至当前行的结尾位置

Ctrl+Home — 将光标移动到文档的初始位置

Ctrl+End — 将光标移动到文档的结尾位置

Ctrl+A — 全选

Ctrl+D — 双下划线

Ctrl+E — 居中

Ctrl+H — 查找并替换

Ctrl+L — 左对齐

Ctrl+R — 右对齐


功能键也大有用处：


F2 — 打开公式栏

F3 — 自动补完

F5 — 打开导航器

F7 — 打开拼写和语法

F11 — 打开格式和排版

Shift+F11 — 创建新样式


文档格式

文档格式有很多种，LibreOffice 支持其中很多文档格式。默认情况下，LibreOffice 将文档保存为 开放文档格式Open Document Format（ODF），这是一种开源标准，将样式表和数据存储在 ZIP 容器中，文本文档标记为 ODT，电子表格标记为 ODS，演示文稿标记为 ODP。它是一种灵活的格式，由 LibreOffice 社区和文档基金会维护。

ODF 是默认启用的，因此你无需执行任何操作即可让 LibreOffice 使用这种格式。

另一种文档开放规范是微软的 Office Open XML（OOXML）格式。它是一个 ISO 标准，并得到所有主要办公解决方案的良好支持。

如果你与使用微软 Office 的人一起工作（它本身不是开源的，但它确实使用开放的 OOXML 格式），那么他们肯定习惯于 DOCX、XLSX 和 PPTX 格式，并且可能无法打开 ODT、ODS 或 ODP 文件。你可以通过在 LibreOffice 中将 OOXML 设置为默认格式来避免很多混乱。

将 OOXML 设置为你的首选格式：


单击 “工具Tools” 菜单并选择菜单底部的 “选项Options”。

在 “选项Options” 窗口中，单击左侧面板中的 “加载/保存Load/Save” 类别，然后选择 “常规General”。


导航到 “默认文件格式和 ODF 设置Default File Format and ODF Settings” 部分。

在 “文档类型Document type” 选择 “文本文档Text document”，并在 “始终另存为Always save as” 下拉列表选择 “Open XML (Transitional) (*.docx) ”。

点击 “应用Apply” 然后点击 “确定OK”。

取消选择 “未以 ODF 或默认格式保存时发出警告Warn when not saving in ODF or default format” 以避免在保存时出现确认对话框。 


按照相同的逻辑重复，重复相同的过程用于 XLSX 和 PPTX 文档。

让办公更自由

LibreOffice 项目由蓬勃发展的用户和开发人员社区与文档基金会共同管理。这包括工程指导委员会、董事会、独立开发人员、设计师和翻译人员等。这些团队始终欢迎各位的贡献，因此如果你渴望参与一个超赞的开源项目，请不要犹豫 参与进来。

穷奇是见于《山海经》的怪物，但却有二说。一是《西山经》，生于邽山，其状如牛，身上长着刺猬一般的硬毛，想象其尊容，也就是把豪猪再放大成豪牛吧。它的叫声如獆狗，要吃人。而《海内北经》的穷奇更凶一筹，首先是其状如虎，其次是生了两个翅膀，这就比豪牛型的可怕多了。而且特别注明：“食人从首始。”这一点很恐怖，如果吃人从腿开始，万一来了救星，顶多落个残废，而上来一口就把脑袋咬下，就是立刻把这畜生打死，人也没救了。
但穷奇最令人称奇的地方，是东方朔在《神异经·西北荒经》所说的：“知人言语。闻人斗，辄食直者。闻人忠信，辄食其鼻。闻人恶逆不善，辄杀兽往馈之。”双方打架，这东西能分出是非来，但总是站在没理的一边，绝对不会错。听说哪里有个好人，忠于所事而能守信义的，这东西立刻跑去，一口啃掉那人的鼻子。如果听说哪里出了个坏蛋，这东西就劫杀一些小动物，屁颠屁颠地送上门去。
可是日本的穷奇呢，中文版的解说是：“高高的树梢上，‘穷奇’来回旋转飞舞，把树梢的树枝、树叶刮得连轴转，旋风的最里面外貌似鼬的‘穷奇’带着两把镰刀模样的羽翅，张牙舞爪，好像那些树枝、树叶都是被这两把镰刀割下来的一样。”
这与中国的穷奇相比就逊多了，可以说没有一丝穷奇的德性。其实这怪物本来有自己的日本名字，那就是“镰鼬”。其图说见于水木茂的《妖怪大全》，说：
有个男子走在路上，忽然“嗖-——”地刮过一阵风，却什么事都没发生。待男子回到家后，妻子突然大叫起来“你怎么了？你的伤……”男子低头一看，发现自己的脚正在汩汩地流血。这种事在以前就时有发生。人们认为这是镰鼬在作怪。镰鼬乘着旋风出现，它的爪子像镰刀一样锋利，被它抓伤也感觉不到疼痛。在美浓和飞蝉(今日本岐阜县)的山区，也经常有镰鼬出现。据说，人们所说的镰鼬是三位神仙，第一位神仙往上扑，第二位神仙用利刃砍，第三位神仙在伤口上敷药止血。因此，人们不会感到疼痛。

二十二年前，陆灏约我一起在香港《信报》写专栏。一次《信报》创办人林行止先生设家宴，约了刘绍铭、董桥、郑树森、蒋芸等几位先生一起，席间几位先生聊起他们的青春往事，原来刘先生他们都是“望月派”，月指的是林文月先生，董桥太太在场，也笑笑指认确有其事。当天林太太安排了很多名菜，包括果子狸，吓得陆公子花容失色，一直旁边胆战心惊陪笑看我们吃，最后他讨了林先生家的保姆米饭了断自己。
这样就和几位先生熟起来。临走，刘先生特别叮嘱我，要用传真机，因为他喜欢传真。回上海后，我专门买了一台新传真机，这个传真机的唯一功能就是接收刘先生的信，因为当时大家都已经用电邮了。
刘先生喜欢发传真，报纸上读到几句促狭的，也会发一个信过来。他见面叫我毛丫头，书面呼我Dr. Mao，他笔迹飞扬如药方，满满一张纸常常也就二三十个字，还有一两个字需要皓首穷经地辨认，搞得我给他回信，也铺天铺地，有时他还在我的信上圈出一二，回传问我，什么字。我一边愧疚，一边也生出小小快感，嘿嘿。
刘先生要求世界是清楚爽脆的。他和郑树森先生一起到上海，郑先生浑身一丝不苟，发型袖扣皮鞋，都在最好的位置，他说掌故也一丝不苟，讲到张爱玲的美国往事，还从香港说起，再被子善老师追问几句，又倒叙回上海，刘先生旁边听得叹气，舀起一勺海瓜子，哧溜往嘴里送，咔嚓咔嚓直接嚼碎吃，慌得大家马上让他吐出来，他吐出来以后，五十个字五倍速快进讲完张爱玲的美国遭际，然后对着郑先生说，you're still a young man.
他很喜欢说别人young man，郑先生听了就好脾气笑笑，每次刘先生给别人戴上年轻的帽子，是他要另开话头的意思。有好几年，我和刘先生都在香港城市文学节评奖，最后集体讨论环节，白先勇先生说话跟昆曲一样，一唱三叹，这篇“了不起”那个也“好了不起”，我们后辈听听，只觉姹紫嫣红，刘先生听了就要you…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[据报道，微软联合创始人比尔·盖茨日前表示，他认为ChatGPT聊天机器人与互联网的发明一样重要。盖茨称：“人工智能现在能读能写，但还不能理解内容。ChatGPT等新程序可以提高办公室工作的效率，比如能帮忙开发票、写邮件。这会改变世界。”


人工智能是当前最热门的话题，就在本周，微软和谷歌发布了一系列相关公告，正在这一领域展开激烈竞争，以确保其领先优势。


微软联合创始人比尔·盖茨（Bill Gates）对人工智能工具ChatGPT的未来持乐观态度，他在当地时间2月10日接受德国商业报纸Handelsblatt采访时表示其“将改变我们的世界”。


ChatGPT由微软投资的OpenAI于2022年12月推出，其用户在短短两个月内增加到约1亿，成为有史以来用户增长速度最快的应用程序。


《每日经济新闻》记者注意到，近期，盖茨在接受《福布斯》采访时也谈到了他与人工智能独角兽OpenAI的合作，他表示，“OpenAI做得非常非常出色，他们在人工智能的许多方面都处于领先地位，人们已经可以通过ChatGPT的广泛适用性看到这一点。”


ChatGPT的火爆出圈让职业人士感受到了不小的压力。对此，盖茨表示，随着机器人变得更加智能，人们需要关注进行体力操作的蓝领工作。


谈ChatGPT：重要性不亚于互联网的发明


比尔·盖茨在接受德国商报《Handelsblatt》采访时表示，聊天机器人ChatGPT的重要性不亚于互联网的发明。ChatGPT能够对用户的提问做出惊人的类似人类的回答。


“到目前为止，人工智能可以读写，但无法理解内容。像 ChatGPT 这样的新程序将通过帮助开收据或写邮件来提高许多办公室工作的效率。这将改变我们的世界，”盖茨在接受《Handelsblatt》采访时指出。


提到当前人工智能创新，盖茨认为，最简单的理解…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[本教程让你通过编写一个 “猜数字” 游戏来探索 Basic。


用多种语言编写同一个应用是学习新的编程语言的好方法。大多数编程语言都有某些共同点，如：


变量

表达式

语句


这些概念是大多数编程语言的基础。当你理解了它们，你就可以开始研究其他的东西了。

编程语言通常有一些相似之处。当你了解了一种编程语言，你就可以通过认识其差异来学习另一种语言的基础知识。

用标准程序进行练习是学习新语言的一个好方法。它使你能够专注于语言，而不是程序的逻辑。在这个系列文章中，我使用了一个“猜数字”的程序，在这个程序中，计算机在 1 到 100 之间挑选一个数字，并要求你猜出来。程序循环进行，直到你猜对数字为止。

这个程序锻炼了编程语言中的几个概念：


变量

输入

输出

条件判断

循环


这是学习一种新的编程语言的很好的实践。本文主要介绍 Basic。

在（Bywater）Basic 中猜数字

对于 Basic 编程语言，没有真正的标准。维基百科说：“BASIC（初学者通用符号指令代码Beginners' All-purpose Symbolic Instruction Code）是一个通用的高级编程语言系列，旨在方便使用”。BWBasic 的实现是在 GPL 下提供的。

你可以通过编写一个“猜数字”游戏来探索 Basic。

在 Linux 上安装 Basic

在 Debian 或 Ubuntu 中，你可以用以下方法安装 Basic：

$ apt install -y bwbasic


下载 Fedora、CentOS、Mageia 和其他任何 Linux 发行版的最新版本 tarball。解压并设置可执行，然后从终端运行它：

$ tar --extract --file bwbasic*z

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[超过一半部署的 PHP 版本已经过了支持期

据一份最新的报告，PHP 7.4 是使用最多的版本，有 54% 的受访者在生产中部署了它，尽管它在去年 11 月就停止了支持。PHP 的支持政策是，每个发行分支支持两年，然后第三年只针对关键的安全问题。但是升级可能不是一件小事，8.0 有一个冗长的破坏性变化清单。受访者认为重构是升级中最耗时的部分，其次是测试、基础设施配置、规划和合规性更新。


消息来源：DevClass



老王点评：PHP 8 是比 PHP 7 快多了，但是谁没事去升级啊？PHP 的优势在于大量既有的应用，如果不能很简单的升级，走向衰落也在意料之中。




中国互联网公司也加入 ChatGPT 热潮

除了百度宣布其“问心一言”人工智能服务之外，中国各大互联网公司也纷纷宣布自己的动向。阿里巴巴说它正在内部测试一个 ChatGPT 式的工具，但没有透露更多细节。腾讯周四确认了其在 ChatGPT 式和 AI 生成内容方面的计划，称相关研究正在 “有序进行”。京东表示，它计划将支持 ChatGPT 等应用的一些技术，如自然语言处理，整合到自己的服务中。网易表示，它正在研究将人工智能生成的内容纳入其教育部门。


消息来源：日经新闻



老王点评：让我们相信 —— 他们都是厚积薄发，一夜之间人工智能就有了井喷式的重大突破。




因为说马斯克人气下降，首席工程师被开除

本月早些时候，当埃隆·马斯克锁定他的 Twitter 账户，亲自测试锁定的推文是否比公开的推文产生更多的浏览量时，他把工程师和顾问召集到一起，问他的团队，为什么他的账户有 “1 亿多粉丝”，却只有 “几万个展现”。一位首席工程师站出来解释说，这种下降可能是由于公众对马斯克的兴趣减弱，并提供了谷歌趋势图和对 Twitter 算法的调查结果，发现对 CEO “没有偏见”。马斯克的直接反应是将这位员工免职，“你被解雇了”。至此，Twitter 的首席工程师仅剩下硕果仅存的一位。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I thought you guys may find klient useful. 
 It's a (*nix) command line Kafka client with the following features:
  
Describe clusters by outputing information about nodes, topics and partitions
 Create topics with default values or with specific partition counts and replication factors
 Delete topics
 Read from topics either as part of a shared consumer group, as an exclusive consumer or by specifying a specific partition and offset
 Write to topics, optionally creating, or recreating them, where they do not exist or as required
  
Unlike the standard scripts, and many binary clients, it's a native, statically-compiled, binary. It uses segmentio/go-kafka internally, which means CGO can be disabled during compilation.
 This makes it very portable, especially when using scratch-based container images.
 You can get full details in the README and you can download pre-built binaries for your preferred system here
 Appreciate there's some other options out there, but I hope some of you find it useful :-)

However, I got distracted by a data science career and toolchain. Am in the process of starting my first SaaS as a solo founder and was looking at what languages to use and was surprised to see that Elm...seems dead? As an example I did a search on hackernews and it hardly got mentioned in the last year (both comments and posts!)
Am wondering if anyone can provide some more light on what happened to the language? Is it a safe bet? And what is a suitable good replacement for it?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Medium.com is still up and running so it hasn't failed exactly, but it's not the best platform to go to anymore when it comes to blogging.
The post quality has deteriorated, and it feels like I'm reading the same posts over and over again. Not to mention the stupid paywall which is infuriating.
Why did Medium end up like this? In the beginning it was pretty good but then it started to wither. Is there any way for a platform like Medium to keep up with high quality posts while also paying their writers well?
Substack has done a good job at competing in the blogging market but it's different from Medium. Medium is more of a social blogging platform while Substack is more of a newsletter platform. Substack doesn't have an algorithm that recommends you content, but instead shows you exactly who you follow. This is nice, but I can't deny that I also like finding new content through a recommendation engine, which Medium also sucks at.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I currently run an older system as a file server with a VM as an exposed web server. The file server boots off an SSD and contains a pair of 1.5TB drives in a software RAID used to backup my wife's MacBook Pro and my Ubuntu PC. The server runs AFP software to be visible as a TimeMachine backup to the MacBook and NFS for connection with my PC. We also have some 'common' files on this server that we can share or simply don't need to have on either personal PC. I don't have any Windows machines at home so the file server does not run SAMBA.
 As the machine is aging and I am seeing SMART errors from the drives but nothing to be overly concerned about now (especially since it is a RAID pair). I am toying with the idea of making the next iteration of this file server a standalone NAS and moving the web server to a small standalone system (like a PI).
 Can anyone share their experiences with a home or small-business version of a NAS (3 TB or so) that can support our Mac backup needs (via TimeMachine) and my NFS connection? How is setup and how is reliability? How easy was it to connect your PCs to this NAS? Would you make the same choice if you had to do this again? Any other comments about your experiences?
 Thanks!

compiler for the COBOL language, James K. Lowden has a
status report with some good news:


	The GCC Cobol aspirant is now 16 months old, and pupating. If
	Cobol's 60-year history were an hour, gcobol is now one minute old.

	When last we met our intrepid duo, gcobol had compiled 100
	programs, perhaps 1000 lines of Cobol.  Today we're pleased to
	announce a milestone: success with "nucleus" and "intrinsic
	function" modules of the NIST CCVS-85 test suite. [...]
	
	We have, in other words, a verified, working Cobol-85 compiler.]]></summary>

Over the last half a year I have been working on a 3D CAD programming language called DSLCAD. Today I am here to show my first release!
It is heavily inspired by OpenSCAD which got me hooked on the idea of a CAD programming language and what it can do.
Please let me know what you think. Ill be in the thread to answer any questions you may have.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[2月10日，在腾讯QQ迎来24周年生日之际，多位网友反馈，QQ在早间无法正常使用，出现Mac版不能登录、手机QQ无法接收和发送信息等情况。 


记者测试发现，目前手机和电脑版QQ已经能正常登录。腾讯QQ官方微博则回应称：“看来是鹅的祝寿队伍太庞大，服务器挤爆了......别担心，现在已经恢复啦。” 


一位腾讯内部人士向记者解释称，是因为短期内流量太大影响了服务器，但很快就修好了。 


值得注意的是，在QQ诞生24周年之际，腾讯还宣布找到首位QQ用户，并公布了对他的采访——Robert，45岁，现居海外，QQ号10201，早期和腾讯团队相识，曾沉迷于钻研各种网络聊天工具。采访中提到，以前也是互联网从业者的他，如今还记得1999年初次体验QQ时的激动感受。 


公开资料显示，QQ是腾讯推出的即时聊天工具，全称为OICQ。OICQ的第一个版本——OICQ 99beta build 0210，正式发布的时间是1999年2月10日，在腾讯创建日的3个月之后。 


据《腾讯传》，在QQ正式放号前，腾讯CEO马化腾曾经预留200个号，他给自己预留了10001号。


尽管QQ曾经风靡一时，但其在社交领域的地位逐渐被后来者微信取代。财报显示，QQ的月活用户自从2016年被微信超越之后，已经连续下跌5年。但在2022年三季度的最新财报中，数据显示，QQ月活人数为5.74亿，同比微增0.9%。2022年开始，QQ月活人数连续3个季度恢复正增长。


随着月活下降，腾讯内部也在尝试对QQ进行改革。2021年11月，有消息称，在最新的PC版QQ9.5.2版本中，QQ秀已经正式下线，用户已经无法再看到自己的QQ秀装扮形象。对此，腾讯当时回应记者称，PC端QQ秀只是折叠在聊天窗口，并未正式下线。


记者了解到，2021年11月30日，腾讯上线“超级QQ秀”功能，向部分用户开放测试。去年2月10日，在QQ23岁生日之际，腾讯正式上线超级QQ秀的测试体验版，所有玩家都能体验。


所谓的“超级QQ秀”，是腾讯针对元宇宙推出的一款试水产品，旨在通过游戏+社交的方式打造一个开放式的虚拟世界。


“QQ这两年已经进入下坡路，但在年轻人里面还有一些影响力，但QQ作为一款24年的应用，其无法再回归到社交核心区域，所以其衰退大方向上是确定的。”浙江大学国际联合商学院数字经济与金融创新研究中心联席主任盘和林告诉记者，“当前腾讯也在向微信倾斜，尤其是视频号，也侧面说明QQ当前对腾讯业绩的贡献已经越来越小。”


盘和林认为，对于试水元宇宙的尝试，效果仍然有待时间检验，但可能不容乐观，很难使QQ回到原来的巅峰位置，“QQ号已经和很多用户的游戏账号挂钩，未来不会消亡，只是在增量用户方面，对腾讯的贡献越来越小。”

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[《文学课》，[阿根廷]胡里奥·科塔萨尔著，林叶青译，南海出版公司2022年2月出版，345页，69.00元

1980年10月至11月，阿根廷作家胡里奥·科塔萨尔受邀在加州大学伯克利分校讲授文学课，授课时间为每周四下午两点至四点，除此之外，每周一和每周五上午他还在该校的西葡语系办公室接受学生咨询。他在课上讲授的内容很快就编辑成书出版了，如今这本书也有了中译本。根据原版编者的说法，科塔萨尔在此之前曾经拒绝来美国授课——1969年，哥伦比亚大学邀请他做访问教授，他认为接受邀请是有失尊严之举，因为在当时，拉丁美洲人才外流至发达国家是一个严重的问题（可能今天依然是），而且他持有一个坚定的信念：只要美国继续对拉丁美洲实施帝国主义政策，他就不会访问这个国家。
拉丁美洲知识分子与美帝之间的这种紧张关系由来已久。从十九世纪末到二十世纪初，何塞·马蒂、鲁文·达里奥、何塞·恩里克·罗多都表达过对美国扩张野心的担心，或是对美国的“伟大”发出批判。爱德华多·加莱亚诺曾经被美国领事馆拒签，因为他在签证表上“您是否有刺杀美国总统的动机”这一栏毫不犹豫地勾选了“是”……不过，到了1970年代中期，科塔萨尔激进的反美立场有所缓和，他参加了在美国的一些大学举行的研讨会，直至1980年在友人的劝说下同意在加州大学伯克利分校讲课，因为友人开出的条件比较诱人：工作量不大，可以有很多自由读书的时间，并且此地毗邻旧金山，这是科塔萨尔非常喜欢的一座城市。我想，科塔萨尔在他的文学课上表达的政治姿态，也正与伯克利素有的左派传统和氛围相契合。在课堂上，既有他的单向输出，也有他和学生的对话、互动、讨论，这些也都给收进了《文学课》一书中。于是，我们能在书中看到，一个阿根廷作家和一群美国大学生之间展开了一场热烈的探戈舞，如切如磋，如琢如磨，展现出拉丁美洲现代文学的特有魅力。
作家谈文学的文字，向来是很耐看的，往往要比学者的文学理论…]]></summary>

在过去两年里，用 Rust 重新实现的 GNU Coreutils 已经接近了 C 语言的原始版本，也提供了 cp、mv 和其他核心工具。除了安全性之外，它的性能已经非常好了。这个名为 uutils 的工具包已经被许多 Linux 发行版打包，现在也被 “一个著名的社交网络通过 Yocto 项目” 使用。uutils 的目标是努力创造一个可以替代 GNU Coreutils 的产品，努力实现良好的跨平台支持，并易于测试。

老王点评：作为 Linux 最重要的软件包和基础设施之一，Coreutils 如果用 Rust 实现一个强壮、完善、高性能的版本，那非常值得期待。




Linux 6.1 被选为 LTS 长期支持内核

稳定内核维护者 Greg 确认 Linux 6.1 成为 2022 年的长期支持内核。通常情况下，日历年的最后一个主要发布系列通常会被提升到 LTS 状态。Linux 6.1 是在 2022 年 12 月释出的，最初，Linux 6.1 LTS 只是被标记为两年的 LTS，而今天第二次被更新为四年的维护期，将维护到 2026 年 12 月。不过，这也仅比 Linux 5.15 LTS 多两个月。Linux 内核的 LTS 版本最长维护六年。如果有厂商愿意提供长期支持，会根据需要延长维护期，那么 Linux 6.1 或许可以一直维护到 2028 年 12 月。


消息来源：Phoronix



老王点评：随着 Linux 的发展，需要维护的 LTS 内核越来越多，内核社区的压力也会越来越大。




Thunderbird 正在经历一次从头开始的大规模重修

Thunderbird 作为一个独立的电子邮件客户端，已经快有 20 年历史了。Thunderbird 正在经历一次从头开始的大规模重修，以摆脱过去 10 年积累的所有技术和界面债务，来保证该项目在未来 20 年的可持续性。今年即将发布 Thunderbird 115，远不止是每年一次的发布。未来三年内，Thunderbird 将使代码库更精简、更可靠，重写古老的代码，消除技术债务；从头开始重建界面，开发和维护一个适应性强、极易定制的用户界面；改为每月发布一次。


消息来源：Thunderbird



老王点评：期待看到这个经典而强大的邮件客户端能焕发新生。]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[systemd 内置了很多管理系统日志的功能。在本指南中，我们将介绍如何管理系统日志，并对其采取轮换、归档和清除日志等操作。我们还解释了手动系统日志清理方法和使用配置文件的变化。


如果你的 Linux 发行版支持 systemd，那么从启动时开始，它每秒钟都会从系统的所有进程和应用程序中收集日志。所有这些日志事件都由 systemd 的 journald 守护程序管理。journald 收集所有的日志（信息、警告、错误等），并将其作为二进制数据存储在磁盘文件中。

由于日志保留在磁盘中，而且每秒钟都在收集，所以它占用了巨大的磁盘空间；特别是对于旧的系统、服务器来说。例如，在我的一个运行了一年左右的测试系统中，日志文件的大小是 GB 级的。

如果你管理多个系统、服务器，建议一定要正确管理 journald 日志，以便高效运行。让我们来看看如何管理日志文件。

systemd 日志维护

使用 systemd 的 journalctl 工具，你可以查询这些日志，对其进行各种操作。例如，查看不同启动时的日志文件，检查特定进程或应用程序的最后警告和错误。如果你对这些不了解，我建议你在学习本指南之前先快速浏览一下此教程：使用 journalctl 查看和分析 systemd 日志（附实例） 》。

物理日记的日志文件在哪里？

systemd 的 journald 守护进程在每次启动时都会收集日志。这意味着，它根据启动情况对日志文件进行分类。

日志以二进制形式存储在路径 /var/log/journal，文件夹为机器 ID。

比如说：





另外，请记住，根据系统配置，运行时日志文件被存储在 /run/log/journal/。而这些在每次启动时都会被删除。

我可以手动删除日志文件吗？

你可以，但不要这样做。相反，请按照下面的说明，使用…]]></summary>

RTOS 是一个开源的 嵌入式设备操作系统，由 RT-Thread 开发。它为开发者提供了标准化的、友好的基础架构，开发者可以基于各种设备编写代码，它包含大量有用的类库和工具包，使开发过程更加便捷。

RTOS 使用的是模块方式，以便于扩展，这一点跟 Linux 类似。各种软件包可以让开发者将 RTOS 用于任何想要的目标设备。RTOS 最常用的一种扩展是 AT 设备包，它包含各种不同 AT 设备（例如调制解调器）的移植文件和示例代码。

在超过 62,000 次下载中（截止至撰写本文时），最流行的 RTOS 扩展之一是 AT 设备包，其中包括用于不同 AT 设备的移植文件和示例代码。

关于 AT 命令

起初，AT 命令是一个协议，用于控制拨号调制解调器。随着调制解调器技术发展到较高的带宽，它仍然可以用作轻量级而高效的设备控制协议，主流的移动电话厂商也联手开发了一系列 AT 命令，用于控制移动电话上的 GSM 模块。

如今，AT 命令仍然在网络通信领域具有通用性，很多设备，例如 WiFi、蓝牙、4G，都支持 AT 命令。

如果你正在创建用于边缘计算输入、监控或物联网（IoT）的专用设备，则你可能接触到一些 RTOS 支持的 AT 设备，包括 ESP8266、ESP32、M26、MC20、RW007、MW31、SIM800C、W60X、SIM76XX、A9/A9G、BC26、AIR720、ME3616、M 6315、BC28 和 EC200X。

RT-Thread 包含套接字抽象层（SAL）组件，SAL 实现了多种网络协议和接口的抽象，为上层提供了一系列标准的 BSD 套接字 API。SAL 进而接管了 AT 的套接字接口，所以开发者只需要考虑网络应用层提供的网络接口。…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There are a lot of Chinese linux distros like deepin, ubuntu kylin, UOS and some more. They are really polished and very pretty. China also wants to replace over 50 million computers with Linux. So i wonder, how popular is linux in China? So i did a ddg search and didn't find much of use. I even went to a Chinese youtube like site called bilibili. And after all my privacy disappeared faster than the prote- anyways, i didnt find anything useful there either. I did a search on searx for Chinese computers with linux. And huwawei is selling laptops with deepin in Chia, which is pretty neat. But how popular is linux in china? How many know about it there? How many devices come with linux preinstalled? So many questions.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi HN, wanted to share a project that I’ve been working on recently.
PodText allows users to find anything said on a podcast. You can also listen and share clips to a specific part of the podcast audio, simply by highlighting the text of that part. Currently there are just over 25k podcast episodes and I’m adding a lot more in the coming weeks (yes my GPU bill is painful).
In order to monetize it, I’m building a sponsorship database to help sponsors find podcasts and vice versa. This will be sold in the form of a $99/month “PodText Business” subscription. I bet I could charge a lot more to large sponsors but I’ll tweak that as I talk to potential customers.
Right now the UI is very bare bones (doesn’t even have pagination) but I’ll polish it once the data pipeline is working well. Please let me know if you run into any bugs or have any questions about the site or business model.
PS: I'm a regular on HN using my real name but can't post under that account since my employer will fire me if they found out about this project :-)

在微软对少数人开放由 ChatGPT 支持的 新必应 后，一位测试者发现，当他要求新必应为一个社交媒体内容制作人职位写一封求职信时，它断然拒绝这样做：“我很抱歉，但我不能为你写求职信。这将是不道德的，对其他申请人不公平。”而是给出了一些提示和几个求职信写作资源的链接。

老王点评：我该说这个 AI 是人性化呢，还是找借口呢？




美国 NIST 公布物联网数据保护的获奖加密算法

NIST 的“轻量级密码学 ”项目开始于 2019 年，以寻找最佳算法来保护硬件资源有限的小型物联网设备。NIST 表示，所有 10 个入围者都表现出了卓越的性能，在不引起安全问题的情况下超越了设定的标准，这使得最后的选择非常困难。ASCON 最终被选为获胜者，因为它很灵活，涵盖了七个家族、节能、在弱硬件上速度快，而且对短信息的开销低。NIST 还认为该算法经受住了时间的考验，它是在 2014 年开发的。

老王点评：值得关注，我发现 NIST 在加密管理方面做了很多工作，相比之下……或许是我不知道吧。




安卓 14 将正式禁止安装旧的应用程序

计划在今年下半年发布的安卓 14 将阻止安装旧的安卓应用。新的 API 和增加的安全、隐私或后台处理限制可能会破坏旧的应用程序，但安卓的向后兼容系统使这些旧的应用程序继续运行。应用程序可以通过 “目标 SDK” 标志声明它们支持的最新安卓版本。但对于恶意软件，把目标放在一个非常老的安卓版本上，虽然获得更少的功能，但也将受到更少的安全和隐私限制。安卓 14 的这个限制足够宽松，不应该给任何人带来问题：任何针对 8 年前的安卓 6 或以下系统的应用程序都将被阻止。


消息来源：Ars Technica



老王点评：这应该不是问题，一些非常老的安卓应用几乎都应该被淘汰了。]]></summary>

近日读姚玳玫教授的新著《垒建新文学价值的河床：1923-1937》（北京大学出版社，2022年10 月），对于思考如何重返新文学价值的历史现场、拓展中国现代文学史的研究视角等问题，颇受启发。重返文学价值论的思考，但不只是在理论概念和价值意义上的申论，而是重返历史现场，回眸中国新文学曾经的多元、互动、自由的生态，其深刻意义是证成一种不甘熄灭的文学理想。
本书书名直陈有关新文学的价值论述是该书的核心议题，其意涵亦值得思考，在“绪论”中作者对此有清晰的阐释。“河床”原意是河流之下的地貌构造，这里意指在时代潮流中的新文学价值的基础状貌与方向。选择1923-1937年作为研究时段，作者的理由是：就新文学的自我成长而言，《新青年》时代至北伐之前的草创期成果青涩，真正可供新文学运用的价值规则尚未形成；1937年至1949年十年间的战争与生存环境阻碍了文学的正常发展；1920年代中期至抗日战争前的十年，正是新文学自我确立、迅速成长的黄金时段。进而言之，“1920-1930年代，新文学正处不受学科体制束缚的自律自治阶段，其价值体系构建是一种自我构建，充满多种可能性，呈现着多层价值坐标的错综交汇”（绪论，第1页）。更具体来看， “新文学经过近十年草创期的实践积累之后进入其相对成熟阶段。与此同时，社会革命潮流的冲击，政治思潮的干扰，1928年革命文学运动的强势介入，某种程度上扭转了其原来的发展方向，也激发了其自我生存的内部活力。在多方抗衡中，新文学依然立足、成熟、壮硕，引领创作的主流，赋予文学以基本的价值认知”（第2页）。经受强势力量的冲击、干预、介入，而能继续作为文学主流而立足和发展，这是新文学内在生命力的顽强表征。作者在新文学发展的时段比较中发现所具有的内在性与时代性特征，…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[近年来，已故宋史名家刘子健先生有关王安石、欧阳修的研究陆续被译介出版，台北联经出版公司也重印了他绝版多年的《两宋史研究汇编》，这位具有传奇色彩的旅美学者在谢世近三十年之际又重新引起汉语知识界的重视，可见其著述的生命力。

Journal of Song-Yuan Studies, No.25,1995

上海师范大学的虞云国先生对刘先生颇加推重，近三年来，通过访谈、导读、讲座等方式，不断向学界、公众介绍其人其学，可谓不遗余力。如《商丘师范学院学报》2021年第11期曾刊登其文《刘子健的学术生涯与故国情怀》，后略加删订，作为刘子健著、张钰翰译《宋代中国的改革——王安石及其新政》（上海人民出版社2022年）一书的“导读”上篇。此文经各大公众号先后推送，流传甚广。
期刊版《刘子健的学术生涯与故国情怀》（92页）称“刘子健，原籍贵州省贵阳市，1919年12月19日生在上海。他在1936年入读清华大学，次年7月，抗日战争全面爆发，北平沦陷……转入燕京大学继续学业……1940年，刘子健获得学士学位，留校担任助理，兼任中国大学讲师”，内有脚注（未见于“导读版”）称“刘子健的出生地唯见于周明之《刘子健先生传略兼论旅美华裔文史专业者的历程》，载《宋史研究集》35辑，兰台出版社2005年版，第485-505页”。
覆按周文，关于上引内容，有如下记述：“刘子健先生原籍贵州贵阳。一九一九年十二月十九日生于上海，一九三六年入清华大学。这时华北的局势在日本的侵略之下日益恶化，清华乃于次年十月西迁湖南长沙。刘先生没有随校西迁，而转学燕京大学，于一九四一年得学士学位……一九四四年至四五年在中国大学以讲师资格任教，次年转至燕京大学任中国历史和中国文学讲师。”（485-486页）
对读虞、周二文，自然会产生两点疑惑：刘先生获得学士学位的年份是1940年还是1941年？他毕业后是留燕京大学担任…]]></summary>

该公司表示：“虽然只有Twitter Blue用户可以发布较长的推文，但所有人都可以读。”该公司称：“无论你是否是Twitter Blue用户，你都可以回复、转发和引用长推文。”


此外，在时间轴上查看推文时，最多仍然只显示 280 个字符，必须在那些更长的推文上点击显示更多链接来阅读整个推文。


值得一提的是，在推特将最大字符数限制大幅增加到 4000 后不久，推特就出现了宕机情况，许多用户反映无法发推。目前还不清楚这两者是否有关联，但时间正好是在长推文明显激增之后。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Atlantic Council (described by
Wikipedia as "an American think tank in the field of international
affairs") has published a
lengthy report on the problem of security in open-source software and
what might be done about it.


	OSS is really not much different from proprietary software: all
	code can be developed more securely, and the security risks OSS
	faces are common across most digital systems. For OSS the
	differences come in the relationships between open-source
	consumers—from government to the private sector to end users—and
	the projects they rely on. The lack of clear transactional
	relationships and the deeply influential role of the diverse,
	ever-changing contributor community are a challenge for policy and
	industry to navigate and support sufficiently. The result is an
	ecosystem that has both enabled digital innovation and often
	suffered from overburdened developers and under-resourced
	communities and projects.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A lot of digital ink has been expended in recounting the ongoing
Python packaging saga, which is now in its fourth installment
(earlier articles: landscape survey, visions and unification, and pip-conda convergence).  Most of that
covered conversations that
took place in November and the discussion largely settled down over the
holidays, but it picked up again with a packaging-strategy
thread that started in early January.  That thread was based on the results
of a user survey about packaging that was meant to help guide the Python Packaging Authority (PyPA)
and other interested developers, but the guidance provided was somewhat
ambiguous—leading to lots more discussion.]]></summary>

It's been a huge rewrite to get this working on Linux and Windows from our original Mac and Metal code.
We also have some interesting uses of cross-platform Swift + Electron in our plugin manager app, and cross-platform Swift generally in the plugin. Hopefully we can detail that in a blog post at some point.
There's a free Filmbox Lite version to try, if you're interested.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have noticed that I am getting more and more addicted to consuming information so I am listening to podcasts while working and I watch Youtube videos in my free time. This is all fun and interesting but I feel this makes me want to do things less and less. Instead of working on my own problems I distract myself by listening to ever more information. I get a lot of benefit from this information but somehow it feels shallow.
I think part of it is that my work is quite uninteresting and doesn't really keep my mind engaged. But the work is tedious enough that I am too tried in the evening to do something interesting. After a few years everything feels like it's a repeat.
Does anybody else feel that way? Have you been able to detach yourself from the constant flow of information and focus on your own stuff?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[有哪些最适合视障用户的 Linux 发行版？让我们一起来看看。


如果有人视力障碍或失明，他们可能会依赖声音提示或其他交互方式（如盲文）来阅读和交流。

他们怎样才能使用 Linux 发行版？

嗯，一般来说，无障碍软件有助于使之成为可能。

但是，有哪些 Linux 发行版是注重无障碍性的？哪些是为视障用户量身定做的最佳发行版呢？

我在这里重点列出一些最好的选择。在此之前，在为视障用户尝试/推荐 Linux 之前，有一些必要的要点需要注意。

Linux 是视障用户的理想选择吗？

不幸的是，并不太是。

与 Windows 和 macOS 相比，Linux 上可用的无障碍软件/选择比较有限。

即使 红帽公司去年聘请了一位盲人软件工程师 来帮助改进，但这是一项正在进行的工作，可能体验还不够顺滑。

我看到一个一年前的 Reddit 讨论，一个盲人用户分享了他在 Linux 上的无障碍状态的体验，听起来可能并不太顺利。

它仍然是可用的，这取决于你想做什么和你选择的发行版。

一些值得注意的地方包括：


不是每个桌面环境都提供良好的无障碍功能。你可以探索和实验，但 GNOME 和 KDE 是可以接受的选择。

Linux 发行版中关于无障碍的文档可能并不全面。所以，你可能想在开始之前进行探索和研究。这里有 GNOME 和 KDE 文档的链接。

你可以随时安装 流行的 Linux 发行版，如 Ubuntu，并通过屏幕阅读器工具进行设置，以开始使用。


然而，有些发行版会给你带来开箱即用的良好体验，可能值得尝试。

下面是你的最佳选择：


📋 该列表没有特定的排名顺序。


1、Accessible-Coconut（AC）



Accessible-Coconut 是一个基于 Ubuntu MATE 的、由社区开发的 Linux 操作系统。

安装后，你会发现使视力障碍者能够获得 Linux 体验的所有必要的工具或软件。

其中包括一个支持语音合成和盲文的屏幕阅读器、屏幕放大镜、控制台屏幕阅读器、电子书扬声器、一个支持 Daisy 格式的播放器等等。

其内置的软件以更好的无障碍性而闻名。所以，你可能不需要在安装操作系统后寻找替代品。


Accessible Coconut


2、Vojtux

Vojtux 是一个基于 Fedora 的非官方发行版，由一位盲人软件工程师创建。

对于大多数用户来说，这是一个令人兴奋的选择，因为创建者知道视障用户需要什么。默认情况下，你在登录时就开始使用 Orca 屏幕阅读器，并启用 Qt 无障碍功能，这是一个为额外的语音合成和其他软件定制的库。

另外，有趣的是，你会发现一个可以快速打开和关闭显示器的脚本。

然而，你必须在安装前构建 立付Live 介质 ISO。因此，如果你没有这方面的技术知识，你可以问问周围的朋友，他们会愿意为你构建它。

你可以在它的 GitHub 页面 或其创造者的 相关博文 上了解更多信息。

微软宣布将于 4 月 12 日淘汰现有的 Teams 小型企业免费版，转而提供类似的免费版 Teams，但遗留数据不会保留。如果想保留聊天记录、会议、频道和其他关键信息，至少每用户每月得支付 4 美元，升级为 Teams 基本版才行。

中国将停止对固定电话、寻呼机、传真机等的入网认证

据报道，工信部周一发布公告，将停止发放有线和无线固定电话、传真机、调制解调器和无线寻呼机的入网许可证的消息。任何采用 ISDN 设备、帧中继或异步传输模式交换机的电信产品也将不被授予许可证。这一政策变化似乎并不意味着现有的设备不能连接到中国的网络，只是该部对采用传统通信技术的新产品不感兴趣。

老王点评：不知不觉中，这些电信设备已经逐渐在我们的生活中减少或消失。




很少有人了解在线追踪的运作方式

根据对 2000 多名美国成年人的数据隐私调查，被问及一系列关于数字设备和服务如何跟踪用户的真假问题时，大多数美国人都很难回答正确。报告说，77% 的参与者在 17 个真假问题中答对 9 个或更少。调查结果也对数据换服务的论点提出了挑战，科技行业长期以来一直用这种论点来证明消费者跟踪的合理性。但新报告表明，许多美国人并不买账。68% 的受访者认为，如果他们登录零售商的 Wi-Fi，商店可以监控他们的在线活动，这是不公平的。61% 的受访者认为商店使用他们的个人信息来改善他们从商店得到的服务是不可接受的。


消息来源：Slashdot



老王点评：我想，不只是美国人，大部分人都不太了解在线跟踪的方式吧。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Gentoo Linux 是 适合高级用户的最佳 Linux 发行版 之一。如果你想要类似的东西，但又想轻松些，那么基于 Gentoo 的发行版是你的解决方案。


Gentoo Linux 以其软件包管理器 Portage 而闻名，它允许你根据你的要求定制每个软件包，并从头开始构建/配置。这样，你就能以最好的方式来优化你的系统体验。

然而，可以理解的是，由于它的学习曲线或设置它所需付出的努力，不是每个人都喜欢使用 Gentoo Linux 😫。

所以，在这种情况下，你可以尝试基于 Gentoo Linux 的发行版，可更简单轻松些。

让我重点介绍其中一些，它们比裸机版的 Gentoo Linux 要好一些。


📋 该列表没有特定的排名顺序。

另外，像 Gentoo Linux 一样，基于它的发行版并不是为新用户定制的。所以，你可能应该在尝试它们之前仔细阅读每个项目的文档。


1、Calculate Linux



Calculate Linux 专注于提供即开即用、用户友好的体验。

它是基于 Gentoo 的，并且仍然向后兼容它。你可以通过 Calculate Linux 得到一个滚动发布的版本，但你也可以根据你的要求选择测试版或稳定版的更新版本。

它有桌面、服务器、云和测试等不同版本。选择你需要的那个。

2、CLIP OS



CLIP OS 是一个值得关注的基于 Gentoo 的发行版，旨在提供由法国国家网络安全局（ANSSI）建立的安全体验。

该项目有两个版本，其中 v4.0 是一个不再开发的参考版本，你可以研究其源代码，并以你喜欢的方式使用它来构建你的 Gentoo 特有体验。

而 v5.0 是一个积极开发的项目，在写这篇文章时正处于测试阶段。它听起来可能与 Qubes OS 相似，但它在各方面都有不同。

在你想尝试它之前，你得构建一个 CLIP OS 镜像。

3、Funtoo



Funtoo 是一个基于 Gentoo 的发行版，由 Gentoo Linux 的创造者（前负责人）开发。

支撑 Funtoo 的哲学与 Gentoo 有点不同。因此，社区的方法也不同。

你可以下载它的 “next” 版本以获得最新的体验，或者选择它的 1.4 版本以获得长期的稳定性。

这两个版本都是滚动发布的发行版，只是一个提供较新的软件包。

4、LiGurOS



LiGurOS 是 Gentoo 系列操作系统中的又一个选择。它的目的是提供一个快速而安全的体验，同时确保 AMD 和英特尔处理器的最新功能能够很好地工作。

你会发现两个不同的版本，一个是稳定版，一个是滚动版。它还可以让你选择你喜欢的服务管理器，其中包括对 openRC 的支持。然而，你得构建安装镜像来使用它。

在它的 GitLab 页面 上了解更多关于这个项目的信息。

5、Pentoo



Pentoo Linux 是 用于渗透测试的最佳 Linux 发行版 之一。

你可以找到 32 位和 64 位系统的可安装镜像。开箱即用，你可以得到定制的工具、定制的内核、XFCE 4 窗口管理器，以及更多。

6、Redcore Linux



Redcore Linux 是一个基于 Gentoo Linux 测试分支的发行版，有一个加固后的配置文件以获得更好的安全性。

它是 Kogaion Linux（最初是基于 Sabayon Linux）的继承者，而这两个发行版都不再维护。负责它的原始开发小组的成员之一决定用 Redcore 延续其思想。

这个发行版的目的是使 Gentoo Linux 能够很容易地安装在兼容的系统上。

7、Gentoo Studio



Gentoo Studio 是一个为实时 Linux 音频制作系统量身定做的基于 Gentoo Linux 的产品。

它打包了各种音频应用程序，并默认允许你有不同的自定义选项。

与一些专注于工作室的发行版不同，你也许需要检查它所支持的软件包/实用程序是否符合你的制作要求。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[《寓兴：花木的图像史》，王中旭著，上海书画出版社，2021年1月出版，268页，158.00元

“花木”是传统花鸟画的一分支，犹如松石、云水是山水画的分支。作为一种题材类型，花木画既依循古代花鸟画的总体理论与历史逻辑，也有其自身的文化指向与本体问题。王中旭所著《寓兴：花木的图像史》（以下简称《寓兴》）是一本立足于历代花木图像及其样式与趣味的读本，全书以“读图”为重心，分四章讲述花木的图像文化与样式历史，四章的标题分别是：“花之容：从应物象形到富贵写生”“花之格：墨画君子与文人趣味”“花之情：书斋闲赏与卧游观物”“花之瑞：富贵吉祥与雅俗趣味”。作为一本定位为普及的人文读本，《寓兴》的文字清通晓畅，但措辞、表达中时时可见对一些历来含糊不清、以讹传讹的问题的明察与判定，反映出作者将艺术史的线索纳于叙事底层、将学术理念融入鉴赏文学的一种尝试。以下略举几例，对书中涉及的学术问题写一点延伸思考，兼谈艺术史普及写作中知识绍述与学术输出的关系。
花鸟画之成立
花草树木、鸟畜虫鱼是人类审美表达之初即十分常见的自然之物，最初对花鸟形象的艺术表现伴随着古人对神仙世界的想象，多作为纹饰刻绘于器物之上，或作为衬景出现在画面之中。花鸟画成立于何时？回答这个问题，须明了从绘画中出现花鸟形象到花鸟画成为一个题材类型有一个发展的过程。
南北朝庾信《咏画屏风诗》曰：
昨夜鸟声春，惊鸣动四邻。今朝梅树下，定有咏花人。（[清]沈德潜选《古诗源》，中华书局，1998年，304页）
诗中屏风上所绘花木鸟雀已不再是“纹饰”而具备了真实的形象感，这是古人对花鸟的审美走出神仙想象、注入自然观念的结果。唐朝前中期，涌现出很多善画花鸟禽虫的画家，如汉王李元昌、滕王李元婴，及薛稷、殷仲容等，这时，对花鸟形象的艺术表现取得了长足进展。晚唐张彦远在《历代名画记》中用“酷似”“尽其形态”来形容这些画家的成就，杜甫则称赞“薛公十一鹤，…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[如果你正在寻找最稳定的 Linux 发行版，当然，Debian 是正确的选择。

特别是如果你打算在服务器上使用它。

但是，在桌面方面，情况就有点不同了。我的意思是，你得到的软件包至少是一年前的，对新时代硬件的支持甚至更糟。

那么，在这种情况下，你会怎么做呢？好吧，你可以使用 Debian 测试版Testing。

但在跳到解释部分之前，让我们简单了解一下 Debian 测试版。

什么是 Debian 测试版？

Debian 社区为你提供 3 种不同的 Debian：


Debian 稳定版Stable（你从他们的主页上默认得到的东西）。

Debian 测试版Testing（有新的软件包，比 Debian 不稳定版更少出现故障）。

Debian 不稳定版Unstable（拥有最新的软件包，是所有版本中最脆弱的）。


因此，Debian 测试版可以被认为是稳定性和新软件包之间的一个折中点。

我已经玩了一段时间的 Debian 测试版，没有遇到任何问题。

事实上，许多 Debian 用户喜欢测试版而不是稳定版。尽管名字叫“测试”，但它是相当可用的。

但是，我还是建议你在虚拟机上进行实验，尝试用你的主要工具来使用它，如果事情进展顺利，你可以在主系统中应用这些变化。

从 Debian 稳定版切换到 Debian 测试版

警告：你不能从 Debian 测试版降级到 Debian 稳定版，因为安装脚本和安装工具只是为了用新版本替换旧版本而设计的。

另外，我建议在你的主机上应用上述步骤之前，使用 timeshift 创建一个备份 。

首先，使用给定的命令更新现有的软件包：

sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y


接下来，复制原始的 sources.list 文件：

sudo cp /etc/apt/sources.list sources.list.backup


现在，让我们开始第一步的工作。

步骤 1：编辑 sources.list 文件

有两种方法可以编辑 sources.list 文件。要么你可以用 testing 手动改变当前版本的名称，要么你可以 使用 sed 命令 来完成。

而我要用第二种方法来使整个过程更简单。你只需要使用给定的命令，它就会为你把 bullseye 替换成 testing：

sudo sed -i 's/bullseye/testing/g' /etc/apt/sources.list


现在，打开你的终端，使用给定的命令来打开 sources.list 文件：

sudo nano /etc/apt/sources.list


并注释掉有 security.debian.org 和任何以 updates 结尾的行，如下所示：



如果你像我一样使用 nano，你可以按 Alt + / 跳到该行的最后。然后你要添加以下一行：

deb http://security.debian.org testing-security main




然后 保存修改并退出 nano 文本编辑器。

步骤 2：更新仓库并安装新的软件包

现在，更新仓库索引，它会显示大量的更新等待：

sudo apt update




现在，你可以使用给定的命令，它将为你提供最新的软件包：

sudo apt upgrade


坐下来，放松一下，因为这将需要一些时间。

完成后，它将向你展示从 Debian 稳定版切换到测试版时的变化列表：



如果你愿意，你可以阅读，或者你可以直接按 q 继续。

现在，它会告诉你，你系统上安装的一些库需要重新启动。按 TAB 键，它将选择 “OK”，然后按回车：。



接下来，它会问你是否要在软件包升级期间重启服务。这里你有一个选择。由于我只做桌面使用，我将选择 “YES”。



完成后，你可以重启你的系统，然后使用下面的命令，让你刚才的改变完全生效：

sudo apt full-upgrade


现在，重启你的系统，你就会拥有最新的软件包。比如我进入系统时我在运行 GNOME 43：



总结

在本教程中，我解释了如何从 Debian 稳定版切换到 Debian 测试版。我希望这对你会有帮助。

如果你遇到任何问题或有任何疑问，请在评论中告诉我。

bring "the future of apps on Linux", but a Linux distribution like
Fedora already provides packages in its native format—and built

After a few months of work, I'm proud to introduce Celeste, a GUI file synchronization application that aims to work with virtually any cloud provider.
 Celeste started from my needs of needing a new desktop client for Nextcloud. The official one had some issues with memory leaks that would always end up freezing my main laptop, and the UI wasn't quite how I wanted it to be.
 This ended up with my wanting to develop a new GTK client for my needs, which was originally just going to be for WebDAV servers, but then I remembered about rclone and how it can connect to pretty much any storage provider out there. From that point I changed gears to making the application work with more cloud providers, thus getting to current state of Celeste.
 Currently Celeste can connect to Dropbox, Google Drive, Nextcloud, ownCloud, and generic WebDAV servers. More storage types are also planned for the future, including Microsoft OneDrive and Amazon S3.
 If you have any questions about the project or just want to leave some feedback, feel free to leave them in the comments below or on the project's GitHub page linked at the top :).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Pretty sure I already know what kind of answers I'll get, but I figured I'd ask anyways; Are there any 'popular' object based shells in the Linux world? I'm a big fan of the benefits of dealing with static object types over text parsing when it comes to pipelines and discoverability.
 PowerShell exists, but being rooted in the Windows world, it doesn't seem to have gained a lot of traction in the *nix world even though in theory any non-Windows integrations should function just fine.
 I've stumbled also upon Nushell, which seems to try to emulate the value proposition of PowerShell and appears to have pretty active development, but it's still pretty new and presumably feature incomplete.
 I know repl's for various full fledged OOP languages exist, but I haven't seen a case where the repl can also deliver on the core competencies of a dedicated shell when it comes to concisely automating and interacting with the os and its resources. Has anyone seen any offerings that have gained more traction than the two I mentioned above?
 Edit: Anyone who is interpreting this as a Microsoft VS Linux post is mistaken. I'm strictly looking at things from a productivity standpoint, regardless of platform.

        <id>https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34693233</id>
        <link href="https://www.nango.dev/"/>
        <updated>2023-02-07T14:34:05.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Nango (https://github.com/NangoHQ/nango) provides pre-built OAuth flows, secure token storage and automatic refreshes for 40+ APIs and counting.
Why we built Nango:
We built Nango to solve the pain of accessing OAuth APIs. Despite OAuth being a standard protocol in theory, it remains a major burden to implement it, even with the help of a library. You still need to add endpoints and logic to your app for the server-side dance, implement token refreshes, build & secure your token storage, deal with redirects on the frontend etc.
But the worst part is that (almost) every API has quirks and non-standard behaviour. This is why we think open source and knowledge sharing is key here: With the templates in Nango we capture these edge cases and make sure that OAuth just works.
How it works:
Nango is a small Typescript/Node.js service that handles the OAuth dance, token storage & refreshes for you. It works with any language, API or framework. It is easily self-hostable for free, or as a cloud service if you want to avoid the burden of securing tokens yourself (that’s how we pay the bills). To get started we recommend you take a look at our Quickstart on the GitHub repo: https://github.com/NangoHQ/nango
We currently support 40+ popular APIs. Adding a new one is as simple as updating a YAML file, so anybody can contribute one. In the coming weeks we plan to add a dashboard, a proxy to authorise requests, monitoring and more APIs.
One thing we learned from talking to other engineers about OAuth is that everybody has their own horror stories: What was the hardest OAuth API you ever used? What made it so difficult? We look forward to your stories and your feedback on Nango!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[谷歌宣布了挑战 ChatGPT 的 AI 服务 Bard

ChatGPT 能以对话的方式回答用户输入的各种问题，它引入了信息检索的新模式，向谷歌统治多年的搜索引擎市场发起了挑战。Bard 基于谷歌的 LaMDA 语言模型开发，目前先向挑选的部分人员提供了测试。Bard 相对于 ChatGPT 的一个优势是，它能利用最新的数据，而 ChatGPT 的数据截止于 2021 年。

另外，百度也 宣布 将于下个月推出自己的 AI 聊天机器人“文心一言”（ERNIE），它基于百度从 2019 年起开始开发的语言模型，目前已是它的第三版迭代，ERNIE 可以写诗和文章，或使用文本提示自动生成图像。


消息来源：CNN



老王点评：AI 大战已经开打了，只是不知道最后哪些公司会折戟沉沙。顺便说一句，我今天用 ChatGPT 翻译了一篇文章，并 发布 在 Linux 中国的官网和公众号上，感觉 ChatGPT 的部分表现超乎预料。




Mozilla 恢复开发 iOS 上基于自己的引擎的 Firefox

前几天，我们报道过谷歌开始“实验”基于自己的 Blink 引擎的 Chromium 浏览器。基于对欧盟新政策的相同预期，Mozilla 也开始恢复 iOS 上使用 Gecko 引擎的 Firfox 浏览器的开发。几年前，Mozilla 就进行了类似的实验，但是根据当前的苹果应用商店要求，不使用 WebKit 的 Firefox 浏览器不能通过 iOS 应用商店发布。


消息来源：The Register



老王点评：看来苹果的浏览器引擎垄断被打破的可能很高。




亚马逊计划使用燃料电池运行数据中心

由于无法获得满足其不断增长的数据中心所需的电力，亚马逊初步计划将在三个数据中心安装近 75 兆瓦的燃料电池容量，未来将会扩大到另外四个地点。燃料电池从天然气或氢气等燃料中提取电能，不需要燃烧，但对于天然气，仍然会产生二氧化碳温室气体。此举措的部分原因是该地区的电力传输基础设施存在挑战，一些人反对高压输电线路穿过他们的土地。但这一决定实际上会增加亚马逊在该地区的碳足迹。

老王点评：这不是和碳排放本末倒置了吗？]]></summary>

 But all of these have a problem: you can't modify image-based a lot, the snapshot-based ones aren't reproducible (and neither are those with A/B partitions), A/B takes a lot of space and almost-immutable loses most of the benefits of immutability. But there is one more that (AFAIK) no distro uses yet: overlays, which I think Pop!_OS might go with.
 After reading the kernel docs about overlayFS, I came up with this approach: * The system files will be stored in the (immutable) /system, and the folders like /etc/ and /usr/ will be symlinks to /system/etc and /s…]]></summary>

编辑按：此文的翻译是一次 AI 实验。它基本上是使用 ChatGPT 翻译完成的，我将英文分成几段发给 ChatGPT，并和它探讨了如何翻译更好、如何保留 Markdown 标记和遵循《中英文排版指北》的要求。在往复了几次之后，ChatGPT 基本上可以给出还算满意的答复，有些地方超乎我的预期，有些地方则不如我用来对照的 DeepL。在最终发表前，我还稍做了润色。

另外，由于在一个小时内提交了太多的请求而被限流，所以还等待了一段时间。

最后，我请 ChatGPT 给这次实验和阅读这篇文章的读者说几句。


编辑：好了，翻译完了，感谢您的工作。这次翻译是一次实验，用来看看像你这样的 AI 可以在翻译方面做到什么程度。最后，我想请你给看到这篇译文的读者说几句。

ChatGPT：感谢您对我们进行翻译能力的评估。作为 OpenAI 训练的大型语言模型，我们致力于提供高质量的翻译服务。我们希望未来能够继续为您的语言需求提供支持，让沟通变得更加容易。



Servo 是一个基于 Rust 的实验性浏览器引擎，最初由 Mozilla 的研究部门开发，但后来 转移 到 Linux 基金会 作为一个社区维护的项目。

从那时起，尽管参与的成员一直在努力，但没有重大的发展。

直到现在。

随着团队发布了一份充满希望的规划，2023 年 Servo 的前景正在改善。

让我带你了解一下。

📢 2023 年路线图：概览



由于在 1 月份获得了 新的资金，Servo 项目 复活 了。

为了确保目标的明确，开发团队发布了今年的路线图，以展示其计划的良好前景。

关于这一点，他们还补充说：


我们正在重启所有通常的活动，包括 PR 整理和审查、项目的公共沟通、安排 TSC 会议。我们还将进行一些外部宣传，以吸引更多的协作者、合作伙伴，和有兴趣合作、参与与资助项目的潜在赞助商。


他们还共享了 7 个他们想要在 2023 年实现的目标：

重新激活项目：这是第一阶段，将持续到 2023 年底，涉及重新激活整个 Servo 项目。

项目推广：在项目重新活跃起来的 GitHub 页面的推动下，他们计划宣传该项目，进行一些推广努力。这将吸引更多的协作者、公司和伙伴，他们可能对贡献或资助项目感兴趣。

主要依赖项升级：Servo 的几个依赖项将得到改进，因为它们比较陈旧，需要升级，例如 WebRender 和 Stylo。

布局引擎选择：Servo 目前有两个布局引擎：2013（原引擎）和2020（新引擎）。他们将与贡献者和社区一起决定选择哪个作为长期发展的引擎。

对基本 CSS2 支持的进展：在完成上述两件事后，他们计划朝着基本的 CSS2 符合性 努力。

探索安卓支持：他们希望探索支持安卓平台以及其他平台的可能性，因为他们已经在过去对该平台进行了试验。

可嵌入的浏览器引擎实验：对于路线图的最后阶段，他们的目标是将 Servo 变成一个“可嵌入的浏览器渲染引擎”。团队也在探索这方面的可能性，让某种 Servo 演示在嵌入式设备上运行，或者研究现有的项目，如 Tauri。

你可以通过 官方公告 了解更多关于该路线图的信息。

总结

一个用 Rust 开发的网页引擎可以产生奇迹，比基于 Blink 或 Gecko 的替代品更优秀。

此外，我们几乎每天使用的浏览器再多一个开源替代品不应该是一件坏事，它将让我们有更多选择。

💬 你对 Servo 计划重新开始，并专注于回到最初设计的轨道上有什么看法？

一、历史学家与历史事实
身处后现代思潮冲击后和全球化的时代，如何理解历史学家对历史事实所承担的责任？
E. H. 卡尔（Edward Hallett Carr），一位在英国外交部工作二十年，却利用一切可以利用的闲暇时光研究历史的历史学家，以其独特的经验和经历，在上世纪六十年代，就曾颇具启发地将历史学家研究历史事实的过程，类比为谨慎地航行在西西里海岸附近的锡拉巨岩和其对面经常吞噬船只的卡律布迪斯旋涡（Charybdis）的危险旅程——这块巨岩就是那种客观的编辑事实、事实无条件优越于解释的站不住脚的历史理论，卡律布迪斯旋涡也是一种站不住脚的历史理论，因为这种理论把历史学家当作是历史学家头脑中的主观产物，安排历史事实并通过解释的过程来控制历史事实。
在卡尔看来，历史学家和历史事实之间是一个互相作用的过程，也是一个现在与过去之间永无休止的对话过程。历史学家在历史事实面前既不是卑微的奴隶，也不是专制的暴君，二者是一种平等的、互动的关系，没有事实的历史学家是无本之木，没有前途；而没有历史学家的事实是死水一潭，毫无意义（《历史是什么？》，[英]E.H.卡尔著，陈恒译，商务印书馆2017年版，114-115页）。卡尔的这番思考，深刻提醒我们，历史事实从不会自动说话，它离不开历史学家的解释，同时历史学家在研究历史的过程中，要对自己所持的既定预设，保持一种清醒的反思。
二、山西票号与中国内陆资本主义
阅读王路曼关于近代山西票号的研究，是一场智识之旅。这是因为该著不仅是一部告诉我们清代山西票号纷繁事实的历史著作（该著英文版是西方学术界第一本系统研究山西票号的著作），系统地利用了大量关于十九世纪山西票号的档案、账册、书信、地方志等新鲜史料，同时还带给我们深刻的…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[使用下面的步骤在 GNOME Boxes 应用中的宿主机和客体机之间共享一个文件夹。


GNOME Boxes 是一个创建和管理虚拟机的前端应用。它主要是为 GNOME 桌面开发的。然而，你可以在其他桌面环境中使用它，如 KDE Plasma 和其他环境。

在后端，它使用 QEMU、KVM 和 libvirt 技术，并提供一个易于使用的用户界面来管理多个虚拟机。

如果你想了解更多，你也可以参考关于 GNOME Boxes 创建虚拟机的 这些指南。

在之前的文章中，我们已经解释了如何在 virt-manager 和 VirtualBox 中共享文件夹。而下面的步骤也解释了 GNOME Boxes 的情况。

如何在 GNOME Boxes 中共享文件夹和文件

GNOME Boxes 主要支持 SPICE 协议 来实现远程访问、共享和许多虚拟化功能。SPICE 是虚拟化领域中最古老的开源包之一。

1、初始设置

首先，确保在客体机系统中安装以下 spice 软件包。

sudo apt install spice-vdagent spice-webdavd   # for Ubuntu-based distros
sudo dnf install spice-vdagent spice-webdavd   # Fedora, RHEL, etc
pacman -S --needed spice spice-gtk spice-protocol spice-vdagent # Arch Linux (optional)


在你安装完上述内容后，重启宿主机和客体机系统。

在宿主机系统中（对于 GNOME 桌面），打开 “设置Settings”，进入 “共享Sharing” 面板。

使用顶部的切换按钮启用共享。

然后，点击 “文件共享File Sharing” 启用文件共享。请确保启用网络。密码是可选的。如果你想为你的共享文件夹启用基于密码的认证，请启用它。





关闭设置窗口。

打开 GNOME Boxes。右键单击虚拟机并选择 “偏好Preferences”。

在偏好设置窗口中点击 “设备和共享Devices and Shares”，并点击共享文件夹下的 “[+]” 按钮。

在 “本地文件夹Local Folder” 下：从你的宿主机中选择你想在客体机中访问的文件夹。

在 “名称Name” 中，给予你想要的任何名称。这个名称将在客人的文件管理器中可见。

点击 “保存Save”。



2、为客体机设置

启动你的客体机虚拟机。

在客体机虚拟机内，打开文件管理器。如果你使用的是 GNOME 桌面，打开 Nautilus（即 “文件Files” 应用）。

点击 “其他位置Other Locations”。你应该在 “网络Networks” 下看到 “Spice 客户端文件夹Spice client folder”。

双击它，你应该看到你的宿主机系统的文件夹内容。

有时，上述文件夹需要一些时间才能出现。如果它不可见，请等待 1 或 2 分钟。通过 F5 刷新文件管理器窗口。



3、一些故障排除

此外，如果你看到以下错误，那么你需要手动访问该路径。

Unable to access location - HTTP Error: Could not connect: Connection refused




在文件管理器中按下 CTRL+L，调出地址栏。在地址栏中，输入以下内容：

dav://localhost:9843


然后点击回车。然后你应该看到文件夹的内容。SPICE 服务器使用 dav 协议，它在 9843 端口连接客体机和宿主机。



就这样了。现在你可以在 GNOME Boxes 中使用客体机和宿主机之间的文件共享。

下面是一个客体机和宿主机访问同一个文件夹的截图。



如果你遇到任何错误，请在下方发表评论。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[上线不到一周日活用户破百万，2个月破亿．．．．．．AI聊天机器人ChatGPT火爆全球，一时间成为现象级消费类AI应用。ChatGPT有望打开千行百业的海量应用场景，引发AI产业变革。微软、谷歌等科技巨头纷纷下场，抢先布局AI新赛道。同时，近期ChatGPT开启商业变现，推出付费订阅版本，进一步验证了AIGC（人工智能技术生成内容）行业商业模式，为AI产业发展打开广阔空间。


备受资本热捧的ChatGPT也正经历着“成长的烦恼”，对于大数据与算力的强依赖将限制其快速发展，超预期的新应用新模式正引发市场担忧，可能带来的合规、知识产权等风险也将给数字治理带来新的挑战。


AI从“幕后”走向“台前”


新兴事物的发展并非一蹴而就，火爆全球的ChatGPT则是人工智能产业链发展到一定阶段的必然产物。经过长年的AI技术研发积累，受益于深度学习技术突破、算力提升、大数据积累等因素，成就了这款杀手级AI应用的“出圈”。


事实上，作为替代人工劳动的生产力工具，聊天机器人并不是新鲜概念。受限技术制约，早期的聊天机器人多偏娱乐性质，近年来更加智能的聊天机器人逐渐应用于客服、搜索引擎等商业场景。


工信部新基建重大项目评审专家、北京邮电大学科技园元宇宙协同创新中心执行主任陈晓华对记者表示，“相比于其他聊天机器人，ChatGPT能更好地理解对话语境，并在生成文本时考虑到先前的对话内容，输出更符合语言逻辑与人类价值观的高质量文本，同时还增加了代码理解和生成能力，极大地提高了实用性，拓宽了应用场景。”


本质上来讲，ChatGPT是一个大型语言模型，接受过大量文本数据的训练，这使其能够对各种各样的输入生成类似人类的反应。“ChatGPT通过大规模的语言学习模型训练，大幅度提高了人工智能应答功能，并能根据人们提出的要求，综合整理和输出相关主题的内容。”萨摩耶云科技集…]]></summary>

 I did a lot of googling and the only thing to even mention this was half a blog post on google (the other half was behind a dead link, so I only got a hint of a solution from it).
 I am making this post in case someone else runs into this issue.
 I ssh'd into my headless server in my admin account. I created a new user for running the service that I wanted to install. I installed the service as a flatpak, ran it as my admin user, and it worked fine. su'd into my service user, and it broke. 
 The error message was
 Note that the directory '/home/user/.local/share/flatpak/exports/share' is not in the search path set by the XDG_DATA_DIRS environment variable, so applications installed by Flatpak may not appear on your desktop until the session is restarted. error: Unable to allocate instance id 
 Searching this turned up hardly anything. Every response was just "reboot your computer", and while that worked for many others that did not solve my issue.
 The only way to fix this problem was to sign in as the user directly, not through su
 I believe the issue was caused by the environmental variable XDG_DATA_DIRS not being properly set. On login, it is set to a directory in your user's home. When you su into another user, it is not updated and stays as the original user. 
 I hope this post saves someone the headache that I experienced from this.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey HN!
FlappyBirdle combines elements from the game Flappy Bird and the popular word game Wordle. I wanted to see if I could make a game that added urgency to Wordle, while also feeling outragous at the same time. I think I achieved it with FlappyBirdle. Every time you type a letter of the word, the bird flaps its wings and you get closer to the goal. It also has an easy mode that ignores the pipes, so even beginners can get a good score. Let me know if you have any ideas on how I can make it better!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[在刚结束的2022年，如日中天的苹果公司，陷入了一轮轮的麻烦中。近日，苹果公司发布2023财年第一财季报告（对应2022年四季度）。数据显示，本季度苹果营收1171.5亿美元，与上年同期相比下滑5.48%；净利润299.98亿美元，同比下降13.38%，营收和净利润同比增速双双下滑。据了解，这是苹果4年来的首次营收下滑，并且降幅创下2016年9月以来的新高。


回想一年前，苹果公司市值一度高达3万亿美元。然而受汇率和iPhone销量下滑等多重因素影响，这家公司的市值频频遭遇下滑，至今年年初已跌破2万亿美元。与此同时，公司核心高管流失、通讯芯片研发失利等新闻也频频引发外界关注。


苹果公司的一系列问题，正逐渐被置于聚光灯下。


“印钞机”滞销，现金牛营收下滑


从此次财报的收入结构来看，2023财年第一财季，苹果公司除服务收入及iPad收入有所增长外，iPhone、Mac和可穿戴设备、家居和配件等收入，均同比下降。其中，iPhone智能手机收入同比下跌8.17%，苹果公司“现金牛”业务下滑严重。


根据以往的财报数据和苹果产品线来看，苹果的发力期一般在第三第四季度，毕竟出货主力军iPhone、iPad都是在10月左右开始大规模出货。甚至可以说苹果在第三第四季度的表现就决定了苹果一整年的表现到底如何。但从苹果财报的数据来看，iPhone当季收入只有657.75亿美元，较上年同期716.28亿美元下降8%，这也是近几年来iPhone唯一一次吃了败仗。


核心业务的营收下滑，正在成为苹果公司市场表现不及预期的主要原因。在本季财报发布后的业绩沟通会上，苹果公司CEO库克表示，“收入下滑系汇率和iPhone供应所致，如果没有iPhone 14 Pro和iPhone 14 Pro Max供应链的问题，公司估算iPhone的营收应当能同比上升。”

在《矮人要塞》发布到 Steam 前，在 16 年里 Adams 兄弟二人大约总共获得了 1.5 万美元的捐赠。而在该游戏增加了新的内容，商业化发布后的一个月，他们赚到了 723 万美元。除了要交将近一半的税款外，两位创造者为其 16 年的免费游戏获得了足够多的回报，并且还有余力雇佣更多人来帮助他们。《矮人堡垒》在其 Steam 页面上获得了 17000 多条 “压倒性的积极评价”。而同时，该游戏的免费版本仍然可以下载。

老王点评：给我的最大感触就是，当你默默付出多年后，屡屡坚持不住的时候，或许恰如其分的回报就在不远处。




ChatGPT 成功 “应聘” 了谷歌编程工程师

在询问 ChatGPT 是否会取代软件工程师时，ChatGPT 称“不会”，说自己是“一个可以协助完成某些任务的工具，但它不能完全取代人类软件工程师的创造力、解决问题的能力和批判性思维能力。此外，ChatGPT 需要人类的监督和指导才能有效运作”。谷歌的 LaMDA 对此问题的回答也类似。但在谷歌对 ChatGPT 进行编程面试时，其通过了谷歌的三级工程师面试。尽管该职位是谷歌工程团队的入门级职位，年薪也平均高达 18.3 万美元。

老王点评：或者 ChatGPT 的回答是基于自保的理由？🤣




因订阅服务欠费，用户打印机被惠普远程禁用

据报道，一位用户反映，由于他用来注册惠普 “即时墨水” 墨盒补充计划的信用卡已经过期，该公司远程禁用了他的打印机。“即时墨水” 是一个按月订阅的项目，会在墨水不足时自动寄送新墨盒。其推荐的家庭计划是每月 5.99 美元，可打印 100 页。但无论你是否使用打印，都需要支付月费。用户也不允许使用在订阅服务之外购买的墨盒，除非退出该计划。


消息来源：The Atlantic



老王点评：明明只是购买了墨盒服务，但看起来却成了 “租赁” 打印机。被网络和订阅服务绑架的未来！

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I know only Pop_OS does this and i am not sure why this is not something more distros do. 
 What the heck is a recovery partition?
 The recovery partition is a partition used by Pop OS that is created on install. It is a fat formatted partition roughly 4GB in size mounted on /recovery. The pop-upgrade tool will sometimes automatically update it, and you can even command your system to boot into it so that you can reinstall your OS with the option to not delete your user files
 Now obviously this feature was probably implemented because OEMs like system76 wanted a way to easily recover your laptop in case something bad happens. It just so happens that it also helps normal users that do not want to search for a USB drive and a second computer in cases where something bad happened.
 And i think this is would be a very cool feature we could all benefit from. In fact it could also be expanded upon. For example with Offline point release upgrades: Similar to the way OpenBSD does release upgrades, by upgrading your system offline from a predictable partition you basically minimize most possible issues that could happen. For example during a blackout you will simply just need to rerun the install process from the recovery partition and not be left with a half broken system.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Matrix 是一套开放的网络标准，专用于去中心化实时加密通讯。

这套标准由 Matrix.org 基金会发布和维护。Matrix.org 基金会是一个非营利性组织，致力于创建一个开放、独立且不断演进的通讯平台。

如果一款应用支持 Matrix 协议，那就可以视它为 Matrix 客户端。

为何要选用 Matrix 客户端？

Matrix 客户端致力于安全性和隐私性，并且提供了一个去中心化的网络，令许多特性得以实现。

自 2019 年（正式版本发布）以来，部分组织以及政府机构便开始逐渐采用 Matrix 协议，从而搭建安全、隐私、可靠的通讯平台。

就实际而言，去中心化的协议实现了不同组织间的相互通讯，同时也使得这个通讯协议得以抵抗审查。

如果你想要逃脱科技巨头的魔爪，那 Matrix 就是正确的选择。

不仅如此，你还可以运行自己的服务器，并加入 Matrix 网络。换言之，通讯的基础设施是去中心化的，但你仍然能够根据需要，对其进行部署和配置。

如果你好奇的话，Matrix 协议具备了你需要的所有基本功能：


去中心化交流

端到端加密

WebRTC 语音通话 / 视频通话

实时同步

消息已读用户显示

“正在输入中” 提示

群组聊天


而且，我还要再强调一次：这个项目是开源的！

所以，Matrix 客户端已经是不二之选了。对那些注重隐私和安全的用户来说，则更是如此。


LCTT 译注：实际上，Matrix 只是在隐私和便利之间达成了一种相对的平衡。它是将类似 Mastodon 的 联邦federated 网络结构用在了聊天中，也就是说，虽然整个网络去中心化成了许多节点，但节点服务器的运营者仍然能对其用户进行少量掌控。但总的来说，相对那些中心化的聊天应用而言，Matrix 是个值得考虑的替代品。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[如果你对 Linux 上的文件管理器感到满意，但你想尝试一个设计上有点不同的文件管理器，SpaceFM 值得一看。


SpaceFM 是一个使用 GTK 工具包的 Linux 的标签式文件管理器，所以它很适合在 GNOME、Mate、Cinnamon 等的桌面上使用。SpaceFM 还具有一个内置的设备管理器系统，所以它特别适合于 Fluxbox 或 fvwm 之类的窗口管理器，它们通常不包括图形设备管理器。如果你对 Linux 上的文件管理器满意，但你想尝试一个设计上有点不同的文件管理器，SpaceFM 值得一看。

安装 SpaceFM

在 Linux 上，你可能会在你的发行版的仓库中找到 SpaceFM。在 Fedora、Mageia、OpenMandriva 和类似的软件中：

$ sudo dnf install spacefm


在 Debian 和基于 Debian 的系统上：

$ sudo apt install spacefm


面板

我不知道为什么 SpaceFM 被称为 SpaceFM，但可能是因为它致力于让你把窗口中的每一点空间都用来做有用的事情。默认情况下，SpaceFM 实际上是相当简单的、标准的文件管理器。它有一个列出你的文件的面板，一个工具栏，和一个菜单栏。



所有的“常规”规则都适用。


双击打开一个目录或在其默认的应用中打开一个文件。

右键点击可获得一个上下文菜单，提供许多标准选项（复制、粘贴、重命名、查看属性、创建新文件夹，等等）。


不过，SpaceFM 使自己与众不同的方式是它的面板系统。SpaceFM 默认显示一个面板。这就是占据大部分空间的文件列表窗口。但它最多可以有四个面板视图，再加上一些用于某些特定任务的额外面板。

南宋史学家罗愿在《新安志》中指出：“新安之石不宜于碑，露暴岁久，则剥泐不可读，加以中更寇攘，存者益寡。”不过，尽管因石质所限及兵燹战乱的影响，徽州一地遗存下来的碑刻仍然相当不少。特别是明代中叶以后，随着徽商之崛起，社会生活渐趋繁杂，碑刻之数量遂急剧增多。关于这一点，《袁中郎游记》曾讲述，“公安派”代表人物袁宏道曾与陶望龄、潘之恒等一起游览齐云山，当他看到触目可及的碑碣时，厌恶之情油然而生：“徽人好题，亦是一僻【癖】，薰习成风，朱书白榜，卷石皆遍，令人气短！”袁中郎一向反对复古模拟风气，强调应直接抒发人的性灵，表达真实情感。在他眼里，随处皆在的碑刻，其实是“俗士毁污山灵”。不过，揆诸实际，“徽人好题”的结果，是促使各类文献（包括对联、碑刻）之数量大为增加。
1935年，杭州西泠印社创始人之一、著名金石学家叶为铭撰有《徽州访碑记》，其中罗列了《宋建炎三年造大圣菩萨宝塔碑》和《明嘉靖二十三年叶晴重修宋塔碑记》。叶氏在文中提及：
吾四世祖义公，于明永乐七年由郡城北门附郭迁居新州，而辟地建置，则自五世祖蓁公通籍后经营之。宅左立庙，即今宗祠也。祠左尚存古塔，刊有宋建炎三年建筑记，又有明嘉靖二十三年九世祖晴春公修葺记，叙述源流，明晰无遗，攸关故乡文献、吾族历史。故予于今秋赴歙，椎拓石刻，并摄塔影，以备续修邑志、家乘之采辑。（《浙江省立图书馆馆刊》第4卷第5期，1935年，79-81页）

叶为铭：《徽州访碑记》

新州一地位于歙县北郊，1980年代当地曾发现新石器时代的村落遗址。北宋宣和三年（1121年）歙州改名徽州后，此处一度为州治所在，据说当地迄今尚存有宋城墙遗迹。叶为铭提及的“古塔”（大圣菩萨宝塔）俗称新州石塔，位于今歙县第二中学校园内，该塔全用赭色麻石凿砌而成，高四米六，五层，八面形体，正、背两面刻有南宋建炎建塔和明朝嘉靖重修之铭记，数十年前就被列为安徽…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Basically I am stuck with a damaged board I ordered from pine64 because the enclosure that supposedly fits the SBC I bought does in fact not fit the case. The case bows inwards, I assume from long term-storage in improper conditions (heat or cold), or just incorrect manufacturing. Basically a USB port casing got damaged during installation which is ridiculous.
 pine64 have a terrible return policy of 15 days from getting your equipment which clearly illustrates how pine64 does not stand behind their products at all.
 Tbf I have had one OK experience with pine64 and this new txn has been bad all around. I firmly suggest keeping away from pine64 as a company overall as they seem to know they have lots of issues and just adjusted their return policy to match the lack of quality in their products. Essentially making sure they do not hemorrhage money in returns while continuing to sell their defective products. 
 I hope you've had better experiences than I have, but if you have not ordered from pine64 before I suggest you save your money and choose a better company to order your equipment from.
