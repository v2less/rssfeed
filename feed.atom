What's the most important stuff to focus on?(please dont just say "the exam objectives") if you already passed it, what worked for you and what insight or advice can you give me? Any input is much appreciated.
 Back story: 
 I got a free Linux plus voucher that expires in mid June. I am currently taking a Linux college course, but to be honest I do not feel like I've learned a lot. I am slowly going through the Dion linux course and plan on using his practice tests once I finish up a few more classes and have time. Little burnt out from taking 6 classes and having a toddler.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Just a quick post for future strangers that want to change their touchpad-scrollspeed because apparently implementing a simple setting for that in 2023 is too hard smh. 
 This post is based on this comment: https://www.reddit.com/r/gnome/comments/kopjm0/comment/gi0790a/?utm\_source=share&utm\_medium=web2x&context=3 .
 1. Measure your trackpad (e.g. mine 135mm x 80mm)
 2. install libinput-tools (on fedora it's libinput-utils)
 3. 
 sudo libinput measure touchpad-size WxH 
 Note: W and L should be a multiple of your actual touchpad-dimensions:
 -> if you want to double your scroll-speed, double the dimensions (e.g. for me: 270x160)
 -> if you want to half your scroll speed, half the dimensions (so 67.5x40 -> round to 68x40, it doesn't have to be too precise)
 Similarly you can multiply/divide by any number, just make sure that the ratio between W and H doesn't change too much. 
 4. Move around the edges of your touchpad to check functionality
 5. press ctrl + C 
 6. copy the text between
 -8<------
 and
 -8<------
 7. Create the following file as root: /etc/udev/hwdb.d/61-evdev-local.hwdb 
 8. paste the text you copied in to this file and save 
 9. 
 sudo systemd-hwdb update 
 10. 
 sudo udevadm trigger /dev/input/event* 
 11. 
 reboot 
 final step:
 You should notice that your cursor is moving slower (or faster, depending on the change you made) and your scroll speed should be adjusted as well.
 Now go to your settings and change the cursor speed to compensate for the error. 
 Happy scrolling!
 Note: You probably have to do this procedure multiple times until you're satisfied.

1. "Verify you are a human"
2. Check the box or perform some other type of rain dance
3. "Please stand by, while we are checking your browser..."
4. Repeat step 1
I'm on Fedora Linux 37 using Firefox 110.
The workaround is to use Chrome.
After experiencing this dozens of times and getting annoyed of needing to use Chrome, I finally went and deleted all my cookies and cache which I had been dreading to do.
It did not help.
I don't have a CloudFlare account so I wrote up a detailed post on their community forums. I offered a HAR file and was willing to do diagnostics. It received no responses and it was auto-closed.
It's unacceptable that CloudFlare is breaking the internet while offering no community support.
Edit: I'm in Texas. I'm not using a VPN or Tor, just AT&T Fiber. I don't have ad-blockers. No weird extensions. Nothing special (besides being on Linux).
Edit2: Since this got traction, I opened a new community post: https://community.cloudflare.com/t/infinite-verify-you-are-a-human-loop/503065
To be clear, I'm not against CloudFlare doing DDoS protection, etc., but it can't be breaking the internet while ignoring community posts on it.
Edit3: The CloudFlare team has engaged. Thank you HN!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There is a question many seem to ponder. What is the short and long answer? Can the hardware such as CPU collect the same level on private information such as contacts, passwords, sites visited etc as for example Windows can? 
 Is it true that it really does not make any difference (as some claim) that whether you use Windows or for example Fedora Linux if the hardware is not open as RISC-V is? Anything else to this matter?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[微软用 Rust 重写核心 Windows 代码

上个月，微软 Windows 操作系统安全总监 David Weston 宣布了 Rust 代码将进入 Windows 内核的消息。他表示：“在接下来的几周或几个月中，我们将实际上在内核中使用 Rust 启动 Windows，这真的很酷。” 软件项目中绝大部分的漏洞都属于内存安全错误。自 2006 年以来，微软在修复 Windows 中的漏洞中，约 70% 是内存安全漏洞。微软的基本目标是将内部 C++ 数据类型替换成 Rust。Windows 的 Rust 重写始于 2020 年的 DWriteCore，现在包含大约 15.2 万行的 Rust 代码和大约 9.6 万行的 C++ 代码。Windows 的 GUI Win32 GDI 正在移植到 Rust，目前已包含 3.6 万行的 Rust 代码。然而，在可预见的未来，用 Rust 语言重写整个 Windows 操作系统仍然不太可能发生。

老王点评：微软带了一个好头啊。




基于区块链来共享空闲的 WiFi 接入点

东京有 500 万 WIFI 接入点，是该城市需求的 20 倍。日本电报电话公司（NTT）建议在不增加硬件的情况下，通过共享方案应对无线通信需求的增长。NTT 建议采用基于区块链的网络共享方案，询问 Wi-Fi 接入点运营者是否愿意分享带宽，允许随机网民接入。当他们连接时，将执行一个智能合约，使用以太坊授权证明来验证身份。作为回报，运营者将从连接中获得少许收入。

老王点评：这个倒是一种好的利用方法。




谷歌计划在认证器中加入端对端加密功能

本周早些时候，谷歌认证器可以让用户选择将双因素认证代码与他们的谷歌账户进行同步，这使得在新设备上登录账户变得更加容易。虽然这是一个值得欢迎的变化，但它也带来了一些安全问题，因为黑客如果闯入某人的谷歌账户，有可能因此而获得其他账户的访问权。因此，安全研究人员建议，如果该功能支持端对端加密，黑客和其他第三方，包括谷歌，将无法看到这些信息。针对这样的批评，谷歌宣布 “计划在未来提供端对端加密”，但也表示 “离线使用应用程序的选项将仍然是一种选择”。


消息来源：The Verge



老王点评：确实，如果有了端到端加密，这个解决方案就完美了。]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This is a general question i wanted to ask since I recently had a go with windows on my native language and noticed something in regards to the terminal and the file manager.
 It seems any translation of the main user folders and system folders under windows is purely visual and from the perspective of the command line shell all folders are still in english.
 In contrast to this linux systems generally like to change the locale of said folders and it even affects the terminal.
 I think the windows approach in the handling of these folders is actually better and less prone to issues that may come from users of various languages, especially ones that require some sort of extended input method instead.
 What do you think? And what else do you think linux could do to improve other locales.

做人难，做女人难，做“名女人”，难上加难！
巴黎旺多姆广场15号的丽兹酒店承载了一部与二十世纪“名女人”们密切相关的历史：1919年，维多利亚女王的孙女、罗马尼亚王太后“爱丁堡的玛丽”（Marie of Romania）带着两位公主参加巴黎和会时便下榻于此；奥黛丽·赫本曾先后三次出演以丽兹酒店为背景的电影；1997年黛安娜王妃也在丽兹酒店的帝国套房与多迪·法耶兹享用了生命中的最后一餐……
当然，谈及与丽兹酒店相关的“名女人”，就不得不提到在此居住三十多年的“时尚教母”可可·香奈儿。可可·香奈儿创立的品牌Chanel以极简主义风格的帽子、小黑裙、女士西装裤与高定时装成为二十世纪以来时尚潮流的风向标。当“名女人”们穿好Chanel的全套时装、戴好标志性的大串珍珠项链后，往往会再喷上几滴“香奈儿五号”香水。而这作为点睛之笔的奇幻香味，也成了Chanel品牌的标志性味道。对香奈儿最为知名的评价来自玛丽莲·梦露，当记者追问她入睡时会穿什么样的衣服时，她答道：“我睡的时候，只喷上几滴香奈儿五号。”

可可·香奈儿在丽兹酒店


香奈儿五号

鲜为人知的是，作为巴黎时尚圈标志性味道的香奈儿五号，还有个远在莫斯科的双生姐妹“红色莫斯科”（Красная Москва）。香奈儿五号与红色莫斯科的故事，构建了一条串联起巴黎与莫斯科这两个东西方的时尚之都、跨越了资本主义与社会主义壁垒的“香氛之路”。而卡尔·施洛格（Karl Schlögel）的《帝国的香水：香奈儿五号与红色莫斯科的气味世界》一书便讲述了这条“香氛之路”上的爱恨情仇。卡尔·施洛格是德国著名的苏联与东…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you ever installed Devuan using the "desktop-live" installation iso and checked the option to disable the root account, chances are you might have gotten a system with a root account with a blank password instead.
 At least that's what the Devuan Chimaera installer seems to be doing as of 2023:
 https://github.com/nicolascolla/WTF-Devuan
 I would love to report this bug but, after trying three times to use the "reportbug" utility with three different emails, and never getting a confirmation email or my bug report appearing anywhere after nine hours, I gave up, since the tool seems to be failing silently (which means I don't really know how to send a bug report). And since public disclosure of this possible bug does zero harm (I don't see any way in which the devs could retroactively fix this, rolling an update to silently change your root password is not something that'd work, probably) I post it here so that everyone can check their own system, and, hopefully, some Devuan dev can see it.

 Hello, I just wanted to share how I was able to get free SketchUp to run on Linux Mint. I had an old Windows 7 laptop that I reformatted and downloaded Linux Mint for the OS. When I tried downloading and installing SketchUp Make, It would constantly get stuck in the installation phase (while trying to install Microsoft .NET framework 4.5.2) and would be in a constant loop until I restarted my computer. Learning Blender and FreeCAD was turning out to be a pain, so I worked at figuring out how to get SketchUp to work, even thou…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Python 的力量使 Linux 上的图像编辑变得简单。


你有一张很棒的自己的照片，并想将其用于你的社交媒体资料，但背景让人分心。而另一张图片为你的个人资料图片提供了完美的背景。你如何将两者结合起来？一些智能手机应用可以进行这种照片处理，但价格太贵或充斥着广告软件。而且它们不是开源的。

Rembg 正适合于此。

Rembg 是用 Python 编写的，因此请在你的计算机上安装 Python 3。大多数 Linux 发行版默认包含 Python 3。你可以使用这个简单的命令检查你的版本：

$ python3 --version


Rembg 至少需要 Python 3.7 且不高于 Python 3.11。就我而言，我安装了 Python 3.10.6。

在 Linux 上安装 Rembg

我在我的 Linux 笔记本电脑上创建了一个名为 PythonCoding 的目录，然后创建了一个 Python 虚拟环境：

$ python3 -m venv /home/don/PythonCoding


接下来，我使用 pip 安装 rembg：

$ python3 -m pip install rembg


合并图像

是时候施展魔法了。首先，我选择了 2019 年在 All Things Open 拍摄的照片。



为了方便起见，我运行了以下 rembg 命令以使用较短的文件名重命名它：

$ rembg i dgw_ato.jpeg dgw_noback.jpg


第一次运行 rembg 时，它会下载一个开源 模式识别模型。这可能超过 100 MB，并且 rembg 将它保存到 ~/.u2net/u2net.onnx 的用户目录中。该模型是 U-2-Net，并使用 Apache 2.0 许可证。有关模式识别模型的更多信息（包括如何训练你自己的模型），请阅读 Rembg 文档。

它在大约十秒钟内创建了我没有背景的新照片。我有一个带有 16 GB 内存的 Ryzen 7。你的体验可能因硬件而异。



过去我曾使用 GIMP 删除背景，但 rembg 比我使用 GIMP 时更快更彻底。

这就是删除背景的全部内容。如果添加一个新的呢？

添加新背景

接下来，我想给图片添加一个新的背景。有不同的方法可以做到这一点。例如，你可以使用 ImageMagick 组合图像，但获得正确的帧大小可能很复杂。最简单的方法是使用 GIMP 或 Krita。

我使用 GIMP。首先，打开新创建的图像（在我的例子中是 ato_image.jpg）。现在转到 “文件File” 菜单并选择 “打开为图层Open as layers”。选择不同的背景图像。此图像作为现有照片的叠加层打开。

我想将新背景移到我的肖像下方。在 GIMP 窗口的右侧有两个缩略图，每个图像层一个。背景层在上面。我将背景层拖到肖像图像下方，结果如下：



这对我的个人资料照片来说是一个更好的设置！

尝试 Rembg

Rembg 有三个子命令，你可以在 --help 菜单中查看：

$ rembg --help


他们是：


rembg i 用于文件

rembg p 用于文件夹

rembg s 用于 HTTP 服务器


Rembg 使用 MIT 许可证发布。下次你需要从图像中删除背景时试试看。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ubuntu 23.04 “Lunar Lobster” 新推出的精简安装程序到底有多精简呢？一起来看看吧。


几周前，Canonical/Ubuntu 开发者 确认了 Ubuntu 23.04 Lunar Lobster 将引入官方的精简版安装程序。对于那些等待 Ubuntu Linux 官方精简安装程序的用户来说，这是个好消息，因为 Canonical/Ubuntu 此前从未对任何精简 ISO 镜像提供官方支持。

虽然在 Ubuntu 18.04 时期有一些非官方性质的旧版精简 ISO 镜像，但它们都已经停止维护。鉴于 Ubuntu Linux 的热门程度，这种无法获取精简安装程序的情况已阻碍部分用户的选择。

正如公告所言，Canonical 现在已经为 Ubuntu 23.04 Lunar Lobster 版本推出了官方精简安装程序，这也意味着那些希望安装轻量版本 Ubuntu Linux 用户的等待终于结束了。

我试运行了该 测试版 ISO 镜像（LCTT 校注：本文原文发布于 Ubuntu 23.04 正式版发布之前）。下面是我发现的一些东西。

在最新的 Beta 版本中，官方的 Ubuntu 精简版 ISO 安装程序现已提供试用。“Lunar Lobster”版本的官方 ISO 镜像大小为 113 MB，这确实很小。

当你首次启动该精简 ISO 时，你将可以选择两个主要选项 —— 针对服务器版本和桌面版本的安装选项。目前我用于试运行的测试版精简 ISO 显示了 Ubuntu 22.04 LTS 和 Ubuntu 22.10 Kinetic Kudu —— 于去年发布。不过，先暂时忽略这些文本标识吧。



我首先尝试安装桌面版本。令人惊讶的是，它运行了一个下载器，以获取用于标准桌面安装的所有软件包。精简桌面版的选项需要从互联网下载超过 3GB 的软件包，而且用时很长。考虑到我的位置与 Ubuntu 服务器状态，我的下载测试花费了大量时间。



如果你将使用精简 Ubuntu ISO 安装桌面所需的时间与精力与常规下载进行比较，那精简版反而慢许多，并占用大量系统资源。举个例子，在安装程序运行时，下载的完整 Ubuntu 桌面版也同时存储于内存当中。

因此，精简版的最小内存大小要求为 8GB。如果你没有 8GB 内存，你就无法运行该安装程序。而另一边，如果你借助标准的 torrent 文件下载 Ubuntu 桌面版，那么用于启动安装程序的最小内存要求则为 4GB。



下载完成后，安装程序将启动立付Live Ubuntu 系统，在这里，你将可以和平常一样安装带有 GNOME 桌面的 Ubuntu 桌面版。这根本没有区别。

来到服务器选项，我在精简安装程序里选择了 Ubuntu 22.04 LTS 服务器版本。令我惊讶的是，服务器安装选项也需要至少 8GB 内存才能开始安装。基于该版本，它下载了约 1.8GB 的软件包。之后，它启动了正常的 Ubuntu 服务器版安装程序。这与常规的服务器版安装过程也是毫无区别。





综上可知，精简版桌面安装程序仅仅只是一个下载完整桌面版或服务器版镜像的 CLI 前端界面，仅此而已。这款安装程序的主要用途可能是 Ubuntu 桌面版或服务器版的联网安装。但，再次强调，你需要稳定的网络连接，以便下载所需内容。

与之相似的是，Xubuntu 团队在几周前 提供了 精简版 ISO，它只包含基本的 Ubuntu，以及不含任何额外程序的原生 Xfce 桌面。

也就是说，这款安装程序恐怕和你从名字里所想的不太一样。如果他们能提供一款仅包含必要的 Ubuntu 组件，且不含桌面环境、Snap 等要素的“真·精简 ISO”，那会更好；就像不含任何桌面组件的原生 Arch 安装那样。

你可以从 该页面 下载精简 ISO。

此前虽然 ChatGPT 用户可以清除其聊天记录，但仍会被用于微调 AI 模型。OpenAI 宣布了用户的聊天记录的新政策：用户可以关闭聊天记录，该聊天记录将不会用作 AI 训练，也不会出现在历史侧边栏中。但在永久删除这些记录前，OpenAI 将保留它们 30 天时间，以用于监控滥用。

Edge 将用户访问的每一个网址发送给必应

有用户发现 Edge 浏览器会向 bingapis.com 发送请求，其中包含了用户访问的每个网页的完整 URL。微软表示正在调查。据称这是 Edge 浏览器默认启用的一项 “creator follow” 功能导致的，该功能当用户访问 YouTube 和 Reddit 等网站的特定页面时会通知必应，但该功能没有正确实现，将用户访问的每一个网页的网址都发送给了必应。

谷歌云计算业务首次盈利

据最新财报，谷歌云计算部门收入 74.5 亿美元，营业利润 1.91 亿美元，该部门去年同期的收入是 58.2 亿美元，亏损 7.06 亿美元。这是谷歌云计算业务的首次盈利。但谷歌广告收入连续第二个季度下降。不过，谷歌从今年第一季度开始调整服务器等硬件的折旧计算方式，这可能是云计算部门盈利的一个原因 —— 服务器预计使用寿命从四年调整为六年，网络设备从五年调为六年。作为参照，亚马逊 AWS 自 2014 年以来每个季度都在盈利。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[维克多·雨果

“作家的固执，或许是他成长的一种方式。”这是法国索邦大学教授埃里克·安索（Éric Anceau）在《拿破仑三世传》中作出的评判。在这位以研究法兰西第二帝国史而著称的当代历史学家看来，十九世纪浪漫主义文学大师维克多·雨果（1802-1885）之所以能够在法国民众中赢得不朽的声誉，很大程度上乃是源于他的“固执”。
无独有偶，文学史家勃兰兑斯在《十九世纪文学主流》中也有过类似的论断：“雨果的头脑是如此固执，他一生中所投入的每一个新的概念世界，都为他结晶成为教义的法典……从他成为民主主义者起，他就一直反对死刑。”其实，除了力主废除死刑，雨果在普及义务教育、倡导新闻自由、消除社会不公等方面也是不遗余力，大声疾呼，无愧于“当世最伟大的人道主义者”之令名。其中最令人动容的则是他被流放后与复辟帝制的拿破仑三世展开的不懈斗争——后者是手握重兵的君王，而这位落魄诗人手中只有一管羽毛笔。在长达近二十年的时间里，支持雨果“死磕”的只有一个信念：从长远来看，思想的力量胜过刀剑。

拿破仑三世

雨果的固执在日常生活及文艺创作中早已显露端倪。以传记作家安德烈·莫洛亚讲述的一件轶事为例：七月王朝时期，国王路易-菲力浦曾在凡尔赛宫“镜厅”举办盛大典礼，雨果受邀参加，但他发现好友大仲马未受邀请，便拒绝前往“捧场”。在雨果一再坚持（并由奥尔良公爵出面斡旋）之下，王室向大仲马“补发”邀请函——由于时间仓促，来不及准备宫廷礼服，雨果和大仲马二人便身着国民自卫军制服赴宴，并在宫中走廊“邂逅”以侯爵身份出席盛典的小说家巴尔扎克。
1829年，雨果创作浪漫主义戏剧《马里翁·德·洛尔姆》（Marion de Lorme），批判专制王权，遭政府禁演。雨果对审查机构大为不满，当面向国王查理十世告状。后者是雨果的忠实读者，但又不便“毁坏祖制”——自路易十四以来，新闻审查在法国已成定制——于是采取“和稀泥”的策…]]></summary>

波兰著名诗人与散文家切斯瓦夫·米沃什（Czesław  Miłosz，1911-2004）早已是国内读者所熟悉的。十几年前读他的个人回忆录《米沃什词典》（西川、北塔译，三联书店，2004年），感觉几乎每一个条目都像是二十世纪历史人物、事件和著作的一条注释，二十世纪的许多面孔、声音构成了他的不能遗忘的二十世纪历史记忆。但更为重要的是，他的那些记忆既包含了悲惨、残酷的政治噩梦，同时也有超越那些噩梦的哲学与神学维度的思考。几年前读米沃什的随笔集《站在人这边：米沃什五十年文选》（黄灿然译，广西师范大学出版社，2019年3月，“文学纪念碑”），可以说是继续阅读处在极具深度的宗教思考和哲学思考中的米沃什，那条思考的路径具有深刻的意味：从“我是谁”开始，经过“站在人这边”，最后在他的“另一重召唤”中进入更为开放和自由的心灵空间之中。这几年来的世界时局变幻与生活语境中个体经验的复杂遭遇实际上也正是从“我是谁”到“站在人这边”的最好验证，这种个体经验也可以看作是对米沃什这位流亡知识分子的严肃思考的真实回应。但是，正如早已有西方评论家所指出的，米沃什的反抗不仅针对极权主义意识形态，也针对自由主义，因为在他看来，后者在面对邪恶的时候是安于现状的，并且在精神上空洞无物。这是一个更为严重的、在当下尤其值得思考的问题，因为在真正开放与自由的精神空间中并不存在任何固化的、不容置疑的事物。在一篇文章中米沃什说他对苏联体制或美国体制都不喜欢，在这两种体制中他都感受到恐惧，无论是政治警察还是贫穷，两者都是“基于恐惧的社会”（《米沃什词典》，195页）。但是，在这里的比较与感受都有其具体语境，尤其是关于美国体制与社会的思考，的确还需要看到米沃什更有针对性的思考和论述，也需要对这些论…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Have you ever asked yourself what happens when you see “command not found” on bash? This writeup is not going to talk about that and not about the flow which determines if a command is found or not (that is a topic for a different write up ;-).
 I am going to focus my discussion on what happens in an environment based on bash + Ubuntu (version 22.04). I guess you at least once wrote “sl” instead of “ls” and you got a message “Command 'sl' not found, but can be installed with: sudo apt install sl” - how did bash know that there is such a package that could be installed? - as shown in the screenshot below
 Overall, the magic happens with the python script “/usr/lib/command-not-found” which is executed when a bash does not find a command - as shown in the screenshot below. This feature is based on an sqlite database that has a connection between command and packages, it is sorted in “/var/lib/command-not-found/commands.db”.
 Lastly, there is a nice website https://command-not-found.com/ which allows you to search for a command and get a list of different ways of installing it (for different Linux distributions/Windows/MacOS/Docker/etc).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've been using OSS my whole life and professional career, and finally have $500 USD to donate to OSS projects. I already sponsor a handful of developers directly on GitHub, but wanted to make a one-time donation. How is my money best spent? Should I make multiple small donations, or fewer larger donations? Here are my thoughts so far.
  
Software in the Public Interest (SPI) controls the finances for a ton of projects I use (Arch, Debian, ffmpeg, LibreOffice, OpenZFS, PostgreSQL, systemd), so I think $250 to them is fair. With SPI I think you can select organizations or have your donation split evenly. 
 I don't want to donate to Mozilla. I've written about this already, but if you don't know, donations go to Mozilla Foundation (an advocacy group), not Mozilla Corporation (the entity that has engineers that develop Firefox). Also, Mitchell Baker's salary is already offensive to begin with.
 I might send $50 to Thunderbird (which can directly accept donations, unlike Firefox).
 I use KDE on the desktop, so maybe $100 to KDE.
  
That leaves $100 left. Maybe split between curl, Jellyfin, Apache Foundation, KeePassXC, Python Software Foundation, etc...? Who do you donate to?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[据法新社伦敦报道，英国竞争和市场管理局（CMA）在今天正式否决微软收购动视暴一案，理由是他们担心该收购会改变目前快速增长的云游戏市场的未来，导致未来几年英国玩家的创新和选择减少。微软和动视暴雪表示将会继续进行上诉，该消息传出后，动视暴雪美股盘前跌超10%。


据悉，这笔交易是微软有史以来规模最大的交易，同时创下游戏行业的最大收购纪录，也是有史以来最大的30笔收购之一。


杰富瑞分析师Brend Thill表示：“在游戏业务之前，还有云计算和AI等更优先的事项。”他表示，大型机构投资者目前很少提到微软的游戏业务，因此对动视暴雪的收购已经变得“可有可无，并不是必需事项”。


接近两家公司的消息人士坚称，微软和动视暴雪都将对英国监管部门的决定提出上诉。不过，考虑到美国联邦贸易委员会（FTC）已经采取行动阻止这笔交易，而欧盟尚未透露对这笔交易的立场，微软成功上诉的可能性不大。


微软收购动视暴雪原本将成为游戏行业史上规模最大的一笔交易。在CMA否决这笔交易之前，两家公司多次表示，监管部门的流程中存在错误和误解，甚至还发出了异常激烈的公开指责。


今年2月，英国监管部门曾遭遇过令人尴尬的失误。当时，微软指出了CMA分析中的一个明显错误。


反垄断官员通过分析得出结论称，微软将推动动视暴雪的热门游戏《使命召唤》成为Xbox独占，从而打击竞争对手索尼。根据微软的说法，反垄断官员的分析是基于失去这款游戏后索尼PlayStation五年的盈利预期，但却将这些可能的损失计算到一年之中，导致结果被严重扭曲。


一个月后，CMA修改了分析报告，删除了对游戏主机市场的担忧，微软的看法似乎被证明是正确的。不过，微软和动视暴雪虽然认为已扫清最大的监管障碍，但仍低估了此前被视为“次要问题”的重要性。


目前，CMA对于云游戏市场的潜在问题正表现得愈发强硬。


微软此前将这笔收购描述为消费者的胜利。尽管动视暴雪首席执行官鲍比·科迪克（Bobby Kotick）尚未提供云游戏服务，而且持怀疑态度，但微软表示希望游戏上云，为消费者提供更多样化的选择。


未来某天，云游戏可能在游戏业中举足轻重，而CMA担心微软会在其中搞垄断。专家小组认定，微软有商业动机去利用《使命召唤》等游戏来巩固对新兴云游戏市场的控制力，而不会将这些游戏授权给竞争对手的平台。


一名了解这一审查流程的律师表示，CMA“在房间里彬彬有礼地听取证据，但他们并不相信这些证据”。CMA的判决，意味着关于这笔交易是否会对云游戏这个新兴市场造成垄断，双方存在争议。


CMA表示，微软在全球云游戏市场的份额已超过60%。对此，微软总裁布拉德·史密斯（Brad Smith）反驳称，“CMA对这个市场，以及相关云计算技术实际运作方式的理解存在缺陷”。


微软表示，虽然微软Game Pass可以通过云平台访问，但大部分用户只会用到游戏下载服务，只有非常少的用户付费使用真正意义的云游戏服务。


尽管有预测认为云游戏长期看来将成为游戏业主流，正如流媒体的崛起一样，但目前纯云游戏平台发展很缓慢。谷歌去年关闭了一度雄心勃勃的Stadia云游戏项目，亚马逊旗下平台Luna也没有吸引到太多用户。


游戏行业前高管、伦敦大学学院管理学院副教授Joost Rietveld表示，鉴于云游戏的模式现在缺个杀手级应用，所以目前很难吸引玩家。大部分硬核游戏玩家更喜欢性能强大的游戏主机或游戏PC。


云游戏市场的不确定性已经成为微软面临的最大障碍之一。微软表示，与英伟达等公司签署的授权协议表明微软愿意支持云计算市场的充分竞争。但Rietveld说，这些服务并不是综合性的云计算平台，因此很难作为指标去观察市场最终的演变方向。CMA周三也表示，很难用微软当前的云计算合作协议去作为衡量这笔交易的基础。


在华尔街，英国监管机构的干预似乎凸显了大型科技公司面临的另一个新现实。杰富瑞分析师Thill认为，这是到目前为止最明显的迹象，表明监管机构现在下定决心，要阻止大型科技公司通过大规模并购染指新市场。因此，这一行动“影响的是所有科技公司”。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[会议是科技行业的福利之一。以下是如何充分利用你所参加的会议的方法。


我在 2023 年 2 月参加了两个针对开源软件的技术会议。我是比利时根特举办的 Config Management Camp 的演讲者，也是比利时布鲁塞尔 FOSDEM 的与会者。本文旨在着重讲述我在会议上的经验，并为你提供一些如何充分利用这种机会的建议。

保持目的性

不同的人参加会议有不同的原因。有些人是某个主题、知识或兴趣领域的演讲者。另外一些人是希望从这些讲座中获得知识并与其他志同道合的人建立联系的与会者。也有一些代表他们公司的与会者。你很可能属于其中的一类。明确你希望从会议中获得什么，这是进行一次成功会议访问的第一步。如果你是一个演讲者，这意味着你要熟练掌握你所演讲的东西。如果你是一个与会者，你应该对你想从会议中获得什么有一个认识。

了解场地和会议日程

FOSDEM 是一个非常大的会议，在两天的时间里至少有六千人参加。对于一个参加这样一个大型的会议的与会者来说，由于许多演讲会在同一时间举行，无法参加所有你感兴趣的会议并不奇怪。通常，这样的大型会议在大学或会议中心等宽敞的场地举行。由于面积非常大，会议会根据特定的主题分散在整个会场。这些会议会有一个固定的日程，所以有时你可能必须迅速地从场地的一边跑到另一边。场馆地图可以在场馆网站上轻松获取。在第一天早点到达会场并熟悉它是非常有用的。这有助于节省你在一个演讲结束时匆忙赶往另一个演讲的时间。

记些笔记

在现场集中注意力和专注于演讲当然很好。然而，你的头脑只能记住这么多。当然，有些人会试着尽可能地利用他们的手机拍摄正在演示的幻灯片（顺着演讲者的演讲节奏）。如果你想在社交媒体上快速更新你正在参加的会议信息，这是很好的。但是它不是很有效的笔记。通常幻灯片上的有效信息是最少的。但是如果演讲者在台上深入地解释了一些东西，你可能会错过这些解释。我建议你随身携带一个记事本和一支笔。你甚至可以带上笔记本电脑做笔记。这个做法的目的是在于通过在演讲中对有趣的花絮做一个简短的笔记，以便你可以在以后重温它们。而且它让你总是能在演讲快结束时回想起要向演讲者提问的问题。

建立关系和促成协作

会议可能是与志同道合的人彼此交往的最佳场所。他们和你一样对同样的话题感兴趣。最好利用这段时间来了解在感兴趣的话题上正在发生什么，看看人们如何解决令人感兴趣的问题，他们如何处理事情，并掌握整个行业的脉搏。你在会议上的时间有限，所以一定要把你介绍给那些从事与你有关的工作的人。这是一个收集信息的好机会，以便以后与他们沟通。你可以通过电子邮件、Mastodon、领英等方式交换个人信息。

腾出时间看展位和礼品

大多数技术会议都有来自各种公司或上游项目的展位，希望推销他们的产品和服务。为了吸引更多参展的人，展位上经常会有各种各样的免费的礼品（在大多数情况下）。这些礼品通常是贴纸、凉水瓶、有趣的小玩意、毛绒玩具、笔之类。一定要把它们收集起来，这样你就有东西送给你的同事和朋友了。参观展位不应该只是为了礼品。你应该利用这个机会与来自不同公司的人交谈（即使他们是竞争对手），以了解他们能提供什么。谁没准你就会得到以后的项目知识！

放松

参加会议不应该只是为了工作。这也让你你从平时忙碌的日程中休息一下，放松一下。很有可能你正在前往一个你还没有访问过的不同的国家或城市。会议、会谈和技术讨论都很重要。但这只是整个体验的一部分。另一半的经验是旅行，它可以使人了解另一个国家、它的文化、它的人民、食物、语言和不同的生活方式。退一步讲，享受所有这些经历，留下终生的回忆。我建议你在住宿的地方找一些著名的地标兼做。你也应该尝试当地的美食，或者你可以和当地人聊天。最后，你会发现你认为从来没有存在过的自己的另一面。

写下你的经历

一旦你从会议回来，不要只是忘记它然后回到你的日常生活，就好像什么都没发生一样。利用这个机会写下你的经历，并分享你认为最好的演讲以及原因。会议和旅行的主要收获是什么？你应该记录你学到的东西。你应该主动联系你在会议上遇到的人。你也可以在社交媒体上关注你可能错过的事情。

总结

会议是科技行业的福利之一。我建议每个人在职业生涯中的某个时候都去一次。我希望这篇文章能帮助你了解如何在参加技术会议时最大限度地利用会议。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Xubuntu 23.04 版本带来了 Xfce 4.18 和必要的修复，以获得更好的体验。


Xubuntu 是最受欢迎的 Ubuntu 风味版之一，提供了极简版的 Xfce 桌面环境。

从去年这个时候 Xubuntu 22.04 LTS 发布以来，Ubuntu 的 Xfce 风味版已经有了很多改进。

让我们来看看新版本提供了什么。


💡 Xubuntu 23.04 将被支持 9 个月 直到 2024 年 1 月。如果你想在它的生命周期结束后得到一个最新的、安全的系统，你可以升级到 Xubuntu 23.10（即将推出的版本）。


🆕 Xubuntu 23.04：有什么新内容？



它基于 Ubuntu 23.04 “月球龙虾Lunar Lobster”，这是一个包含许多重要更新的版本。值得注意的亮点包括以下内容：


桌面环境升级

删除默认的 Flatpak 支持

Xubuntu 极简版

加入 PipeWire



📋 这不是一个 长期支持版本。因此，对于大多数人来说，你不是必须升级。只有当你想体验最新和最好的版本，同时愿意在一年内再次升级的时候，再去进行这一操作。


桌面环境升级



在这个版本中，你会注意到最重要的变化是加入了 Xfce 4.18，它带来了许多新的改进，使其比前代产品更加完善。

其中一些改进包括：Thunar 文件管理器增加了重大功能、Xfce 面板的更新、新的壁纸、初步的 Wayland 支持 等等。

你可以通过我们的报道来了解更多：


XFCE 4.18 发布先窥


移除默认的 Flatpak 支持

是的，你没看错！

由于 Xubuntu 是 Ubuntu 的一个版本，Flatpak 支持不再是一个默认的选项，Snap 才是。

你仍然可以通过在终端运行几行代码，在几分钟内设置好 Flatpak。

最小化 ISO 的引入

与 Ubuntu 类似, 你现在可以使用 Xubuntu 的最小化的 ISO，尽管它不像为 Ubuntu 设计的那样小，但它与标准 ISO 相比仍然很小。

这个最小的ISO只有 1.7 GB 大小，带有一套最小化的 应用程序：终端、文件管理器、系统设置应用程序、Snap 软件包管理器和屏幕截图应用程序。

正因为如此，它所 占用的存储空间 也比标准安装要少。

加入 PipeWire

Xubuntu 现在终于有了 PipeWire。这应该会为整个系统加强对音频和视频的处理。

它还将有助于以极小的延迟和实时处理来捕获和播放音频/视频。

🛠️ 其他改进措施

除了上述提到的之外，这里还有一些值得了解的应用更新：


Linux 内核 6.2

Firefox 111.0（Snap

GIMP 2.10.34

LibreOffice 7.5.2

Pipewire 0.3.65

Snapd 2.58.3

Thunderbird 102.9.0

由于对系统托盘插件的图标大小进行了“自动调整”，托盘图标和系统状态图标现在有了一个更一致的外观

为了提高可读性，终端的默认字体大小从 9 号增加到了 10 号


你也可以查看 发行说明 来深入了解技术上的变化。

📥 下载 Xubuntu 23.04

前往 官方网站 获取最新的 ISO 镜像, 或者使用 Ubuntu 镜像库 来获取它。


Xubuntu 23.04


如果你已经是一个 ** Ubuntu 用户**，你可以按照 官方指南 来进行升级。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello everyone, as part of my self taught journey in development, I made this simple first project that harvests data (replies, posts etc...) from 3 sources now: Reddit, 4Chan and Twitter.
 The concept is simple, harvest replies from posts including the post title and body from sources, and for Twitter it goes through a list of top #tags and goes through each top tweet first and harvests it's title + all the replies, then the "min_limit" of replies for the tweet is removed to harvest ALL tweets no matter their reply count. Twitter is still in beta so its process it ran separately until a stable version is released. It also supports both Linux and Windows.
 This is the repo with details for anyone interested: https://github.com/Tsujimar/tsuki-wscp
 And this is how it looks like when active: https://gyazo.com/d6c1deeab1655cf3de34babb89df079b
 Thank you for taking the time to read!

 Install Linux Mint
 Connect your computer to a wired internet connection via Ethernet or phone wired hotspot
 Install your wifi driver 
 Run the command : sudo apt update
 Post install configs:
 1: Use MBPfan. Your fans will either not spin up without it, or they’ll always be at full speed. One means your computer overheats and the other means that your computer is burning battery. These old models do have a bit of a general heat problems which is normal but it can be made worse by fan problems. 
 Use the following commands:
 sudo apt install mbpfan
 sudo mbpfan
 sudo systemctl enable mbpfan
 Three separate commands starting with sudo.
 Congrats MBPfan now works.
 2: Install TPL so your battery doesn’t run out in 2 hours from having your cpu running at full speed constantly.
 sudo apt install tlp
 Sudo tlp start
 Sudo systemctl status tlp
 Congrats now your battery works. 
 I’ve spent the better part of the last week dealing with this shit. Maybe it’ll stop someone else from having to.

        <id>https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35712238</id>
        <link href="https://renewables-map.robinhawkes.com/"/>
        <updated>2023-04-26T11:53:09.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[GB Renewables Map an energy experiment created entirely in my free time (day job is visualisation at Octopus Energy).
It's an interactive map showing live generation for major wind farms in Great Britain, showing what each wind farm is generating both now and in the past, and where that generation is physically located.
Animated weather data is from WeatherLayers and shows current and historic wind conditions on the map, providing context to wind generation around the country.
History mode allows you to go back in time and see wind generation and weather conditions for a particular date and time. It's great for exploring days of record generation, such as the 21.6GW record on January 10th, 2023!
Prediction mode lets you see what wind farms are estimated to be generating using current wind conditions and model based on historic generation and wind speeds. Is a wind farm generating as you expect, or is there something to look into?
An experimental feature allows you to see what future wind farms could be generating today (or in the past!) if they were already built and operational. If you click the "sparkle" button on the map you'll get to see what the upcoming 3.6GW Dogger Bank wind farm is estimated to generate if it was operational today.
There's an "About" section on the site that goes into detail on the various public data sources and how some of the features work. I also document a lot of this on my Twitter @robhawkes if you're curious.
This is just the start and there are many more features to come!
Please let me know your comments and suggestions.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[在 2023 年 4 月 26 日举办的阿里云合作伙伴大会上，阿里巴巴董事会主席兼 CEO 以及阿里云智能 CEO 张勇表示，阿里云是一家云计算产品公司，其生态是其根基，核心是要坚定走向“产品被集成”。张勇表示，我们目前正站在智能化的起点，这是让“被集成”真正做到的最佳契机。因此，阿里云要走向“产品被集成”，并建立“1+3+1”的产品被集成结构。具体而言，阿里云的顶层为 MaaS（模型即服务）；中间层为三个 PaaS（平台即服务）被集成，钉钉和瓴羊进入产品矩阵，与阿里云平台产品构成三大 PaaS 被集成；底部为 IaaS（基础设施即服务）云基础设施产品被集成。



炙手可热的千问大模型，在云峰会发布后，反响强烈。和外界对大模型理解的 2C 聊天场景不同，阿里云认为，千问的核心价值将体现在行业场景和产业落地上，让 AI 更普及。

张勇表示，阿里云要全面走向“模型即服务”，并与合作伙伴合作，走向千行百业的数字化和智能化。阿里云将启动“千问伙伴计划”，优先为千问伙伴提供大模型领域的技术、服务与产品支持，共同推动大模型在不同行业中的应用。包括昆仑数智、朗新科技、千方科技、中金财富、石基集团、用友网络和亚信科技在内的七家行业数字化服务提供商成为了首批伙伴，将与阿里云联合推进油气、电力、交通、金融、酒店旅游、企业服务、通信行业的智能化。

阿里云将提供安全可隔离的专属数据存储空间，并通过服务器端加密机制，实现高安全性和高合规性的数据保护。伙伴和企业可以上传自己的行业数据，并调用千问进行重新训练。训练完成后，专属大模型还可以通过 Web 界面和专属 API 向垂直领域的各类企业、开发者提供应用服务，比如通晓行业知识的智能客服、导购、咨询专家、创作者助手、工业机器人等。

其次，在阿里云平台产品、钉钉和瓴羊构成的 PaaS 被集成矩阵中，阿里云平台产品如云原生数据库（PolarDB）、机器学习平台（PAI），以及容器服务（ACK）等全面向合作伙伴开放。阿里云将以更加标准化、易于兼容的方式，为合作伙伴提供多种产品，帮助合作伙伴打造更具弹性和灵活性的数字化和智能化产品。

张勇表示，钉钉和瓴羊都是非常独特的 PaaS 层服务产品。钉钉是非常重要的工作平台 PaaS，而瓴羊则是数据智能平台。这两个产品被合作伙伴集成，将进一步帮助各行各业完成数字化，并为客户提供更好的服务。

钉钉作为企业的应用开发平台，提供超过 2400 个开放接口，在与生态伙伴的协作下，提供低代码、酷应用、连接器等产品和能力：客户和伙伴可以在钉钉低代码平台上开发各类企业应用；通过连接器将企业各类应用系统连接，实现数据的打通；酷应用则将业务应用打碎并推送至钉钉群聊中，让过去低频的应用进入群聊的高频场景。在接入千问大模型后，钉钉还会将大模型+酷应用能力提供给伙伴集成，进一步降低应用开发和使用门槛。

例如，合作伙伴为客户开发差旅系统时，可以利用钉钉的低代码能力降低开发成本，用连接器帮助客户把新增的差旅系统和企业自有的财务系统打通，让员工申请差旅费用支付的同时就自动计入财务系统的成本中。这套流程还可以实时推送到钉钉上，让员工和财务都能及时互动。

瓴羊围绕数据智能，可以为伙伴提供三层“被集成”的核心能力：第一，好数据，协助伙伴为客户解决“无数可用”的问题，让客户数据资产更丰富。第二，保安全，伙伴可以在各种应用场景中集成数据安全能力，保障客户数据隐私。第三，强智能，集成瓴羊的智能产品，解决客户“驱动增值”的问题，让数据智能推动客户业务进步。

最后，在云基础设施 IaaS 层，阿里云将进一步推动算力普惠，释放技术红利，并为伙伴提供软硬一体的自研技术底座，降低伙伴集成算力技术的成本。现场，阿里云宣布核心产品全线降价，包括弹性计算 7 代实例、倚天实例、存储 OSS 深度冷归档、网络负载均衡 SLB 和 NAT 网关、数据库 RDS 倚天版等等，最高降幅达 50%。这样一来，国内主流云产品的价格形成了新的格局，根据公开资料，对比如下：]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Suppose you have two terminal windows open; in one of them, you've laboriously cd'd into a path that's like 10 folders deep and none of them were tab-completion friendly and you really don't want to do it again.
 Now you want to access that same path from the other terminal, in which you're just sitting in your homedir.
 In the deep-in-folders terminal:
 echo $$ 
 That prints the shell's own PID (process ID), which will be a number like "12467".
 Now in the other one, all you need to do to jump directly into the same working folder is:
 cd /proc/12467/cwd 
 Some points:
  
If you want to go up from there and not land in /proc , you can either do a cd -P . after you arrive, or put the -P into the command above - note that -P has to come before the path. (Edit: After some playing around, I think bash has some issues with symlinks and cd. So, I'll add a caution: pay attention when using cd or cd -P across links, especially dynamically generated ones like those in /proc, and make sure you land where you expected.)
 
You can of course also use this to do other stuff; e.g. copy files back and forth - cp "here other shell, have this file" /proc/12467/cwd/ will work as expected, as will cp /proc/12467/cwd/"file you just made in the other shell.txt" ./"give it here".
 
For extra fun and games, I'm thinking of tweaking my tmux and shell configs so that when I'm in a tmux session, each pane displays its name in PS1 or the status bar, and has an auto-updated symlink to its working dir; then I can just reference each pane's working dir at a glance with something short like, I dunno, ~/l/3/
 
I completely expect there to be a much better way of doing this that I just haven't thought of. Looking forward to the "but why don't you just ..." :)

Why are such major apps not verified on flathub and how do I know who put together the flathub? They have a link to the official GitHub but if they are not verified doesn’t that mean anyone put it together and is simply linking to the original?

 Ok guys I don't know where else to post this, but since it took me way too much time to figure it out I will give advice in how you can set up Grub so that you can multiboot an old mbr Windows and a Linux or any OS with efi for that matter.
 Short answer is you can't. Took me over an hour to figure that out. Long answer follows.
 So basically while researching I found as only solution to replace your mbr with gpt which according to user feedback most often broke the entire thing. So I didn't even try to do that. Now but how can I set it up in a way that I won't have to constantly press f8 to switch from which hdd to boot.
 Well the answer for setting up your windows to use efi (and technically also still the mbr) i…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[《软弱的反叛者：太宰治传》，[日]奥野健男著，吕灵芝译，明室Lucida｜北京联合出版公司，2023年2月出版，376页，69.80元

每年6月19日，总会有几百名年轻人聚集在日本东京都三鹰市的禅林寺，纪念在1948年的这一天投水自杀的太宰治。这一活动被命名为“樱桃忌”，源自太宰的短篇《樱桃》。在这个故事结尾，当“一盘樱桃送了上来”，主人公明知道“在我家不会让孩子们吃着这么奢侈的东西”，“若是让他们吃，他们一定会很高兴吧”，然而“我这个孩子的爹却像是极端难吃似的吃着一大盘樱桃”，“心里虚弱地念叨着：父母比孩子更重要”（引自《人间失格》，许时嘉译，吉林出版集团，2012年，156页）。而最后这句话，也成为太宰治众多离经叛道的言语中，颇为知名的一句。
年轻人喜欢这个故事。作为“樱桃忌”的一个仪式，他们会在太宰治的墓碑所刻文字的凹槽里嵌上樱桃。这或许是因为，年轻人是孩子与大人之间的存在。社会伦常驱使着他们早日成为“父母”，但成为父母就意味着继承曾经让他们深恶痛绝的约束之力，而这种力量的合法性，便来自貌似无私的“父母之爱”。太宰治戳破了这个谎言，他吃掉了樱桃，难怪年轻人喜欢他。
在《软弱的反叛者：太宰治传》一书中（以下引文未标注页码者均引自本书），日本文艺评论家、太宰治研究权威奥野健男进一步指出，太宰治对现实伦理的抨击基于他对于秩序的反抗，然而这种秩序既是尚未降临的“现代资本主义秩序”，亦是“自己浸淫其中的日本封建秩序”（44页）。这便意味着他的反抗乃至破坏，终究会殃及自身。因而“太宰治的一生，可以说是一个性格软弱而孤独的人，为了忠于自己的宿命和伦理，不得不进行苦斗的生涯”（152页）。换言之，他在名为“现代性”的裂谷中进退不得——而这既是一代代“软弱的年轻人”的宿命，也是更大意义上日本乃至东亚文化的宿命。

Firstly, this is a todo app for your life. Existing tools are built around how we work as employees in a company. With a company, all the habits, goals, vision and rituals are given to you in an employee handbook. The company is our coach, and in most cases, we listen and do as the coach says. Its easier to get things done in this environment.
In our personal lives, we gotta figure out our goals, work on our habits and setup rituals. We're also more flexible, more forgiving on when we want to do certain things and more rigid on the others. The Daily Planner is central to that ideology, working with one off and repeatable tasks . You onboard with your day first, could be as simple as calling your mum or going on a walk or do yoga. As you get more comfortable, you start to consciously build a life that you want to live by creating rituals and setting goals as you get more confident.
Personally, I haven't been able to get that through Todoist or Notion.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Before starting to share what I learned, I'll need to give a bit of context on why I ended up learning how to mount a remote filesystem (my android device) over ssh.
 Recently, I wanted to create a backup of my android files. Keep in mind that I don't care about app data, I just want to backup images, videos, documents, etc.
 In the past, I wrote a script (leveraging adb) that creates backups of the specified folders. But there were some issues: - the script was not incremental, so at first it was fine, but now that I start to have more than 7 GB to backup, having to copy everything each time can be pretty slow - the script did not provide any kind of encryption: I am fine uploading my data on some cloud provider, so if my hdd breaks I can still recover it, but I do not want them to have a…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A while ago I created a software, called exeCute, which simplifies the usage of Wine and DosBox. Same as Proton, but more targeted to use on the desktop outside Steam.
 exeCute automates most things around configuring Wine. You just have to click on the executable you want, and exeCute configures Wine optimally.
 Lately I have been improving it drastically, and now it automates all these things:
 - Selects if to launch with Wine or Dosbox.
 - Installs dxvk vkd3d, so all DirectX applications run fast using Vulkan as backend. Skips if the GPU doesn't support Vulkan.
 - Mounts any disk image found in the executable folder, simulating a physical disc.
 - Sets DPI according to the current resolution.
 - Restores desktop resolution if Wine hasn't done so.
 - Enables quality midi through Fluidsynth and soundfont-generaluser.
 - Simulates a virtual desktop if you place a "desktop.conf" file in the application folder with the desktop resolution you want.

 Last night I converted some shell scripts to Lua (with the sh module from luarocks) and holy smokes, why isn't Lua used more often? 
 The syntax is sensible, there's no "double quotes something something variable expansion" warning from shellcheck to deal with, the sh module makes it look like a proper shell script. Heck, this was my first time with Lua, I only had LuaJIT installed as a Neovim dependency.
 So my question is, why isn't Lua adopted more as a shell scripting language, and hat other languages have y'all used as Bash alternatives?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[4月25日，就网易方面提出的诉讼要求，暴雪中国对澎湃新闻记者回应称：“暴雪目前并未收到相关诉状，但我们相信我方并未违反任何授权协议。网易方面疑似不满的合同条款，涉及标准行业惯例，且在过往这些年来对双方来说都是互利的。虽然这些持续性的行为，让我们感到失望与困惑，需要指出的是，在华近二十年的运营历程一直是非常正面和愉快的，我们将继续致力于为当地玩家服务并保护他们的权益。”


暴雪相关人士还告诉记者，不认为玩家收到的退款是由网易单方面垫付的。


此前一天(4月24日)，知情人士告诉记者，近日，《魔兽世界》大陆地区运营方、网易旗下上海网之易网络科技发展有限公司(以下简称“网之易”)就暴雪娱乐有限公司违反系列许可协议在上海提起诉讼，要求退还3亿元欠款。该款项包括网之易已全额支付的《魔兽世界》等停服游戏相关退款、未售游戏商品库存的预付款项、数款未开发游戏的预付保证金等。


前述知情人士称，该案还涉及《魔兽世界》等国服代理游戏相关协议中，包含多个偏向暴雪单方权益的不平等条款，相关条款的合法性、可执行性存在巨大争议。


今年1月17日，暴雪发布公开信称，曾向网易寻求协助，希望能将合约顺延六个月，但遭到拒绝，因此将遵照停服公告，于1月23日中止国服游戏服务。


1月24日0时，由网之易代理的《魔兽世界》《炉石传说》《守望先锋》《暗黑破坏神Ⅲ》《魔兽争霸Ⅲ：重制版》《风暴英雄》《星际争霸》系列产品在中国大陆市场的运营已经正式终止，暴雪已关闭战网登录以及所有游戏服务器，同时关闭客户端下载。


网易和暴雪的合作起源于2008年：当时暴雪宣布将旗下《星际争霸II》《魔兽争霸III: 混乱之治》《魔兽争霸III: 冰封王座》，以及战网平台在中国大陆的独家运营权，全部授予网之易。双方在合作接近十四年后，在去年11月宣布“分道扬镳”。


记者了解到，双方在续约条件、合约时间等多方面产生不可调和的分歧。


据悉，网之易起诉暴雪的首要原因，是因为暴雪拒绝承担国服玩家退款义务，拒绝向网之易支付国服退款相关的预付提成费用。接近网之易的知情人士表示，在1月24日《魔兽世界》《炉石传说》《守望先锋》等暴雪游戏国服停服后，网之易已全额支付超112万玩家相关退款申请。


不过，接近暴雪的知情人士则表示，暴雪方面不认为玩家此前收到的退款，是由网易单方面垫付的。


“网之易作为运营方，退款只能由他们退，但是在财务上不能混淆视听，把网之易账上的钱退回给玩家说成是由网易退的，或者由网易单方面垫资的。”上述接近人士表示。


此前，接近网易知情人士透露，网易起诉要求退还的3亿欠款，包括网易已全额支付的《魔兽世界》等停服游戏相关退款、未售游戏商品库存的预付款项、数款未开发游戏的预付保证金等。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[黑客组织的名称开始变得奇怪

微软的网络安全部门最近对其追踪的数百个黑客组织的命名分类法进行了修改，采用两个字的名称，包括一个天气术语，如“薄荷沙尘暴”、“贝壳暴风雪”，以表明黑客的可疑国家和隶属关系。批评者认为，这些异想天开的新名字可能会妨碍人们对这个行业的看法，并对网络安全分析产生反作用。


消息来源：Wired



老王点评：为了避免被取个可笑的名字，黑客组织会不会以后主动留下“某某到此一游”呢？




微软放弃在 Office 中捆绑 Teams

2020 年，微软 Teams 的竞争对手 Slack 向欧盟委员会投诉微软，指责微软将 Teams 捆绑进 Office 的方式是反竞争的，违反了欧盟的反垄断法律。为了避开十多年以来首次的反垄断调查，微软同意停止在 Office 中捆绑 Teams 的做法，过去已经证明与欧盟打官司会让它伤筋动骨。今后，当购买 Office 时，客户可以选择加入或不加入 Teams。

老王点评：看了欧盟的反垄断调查是真有威力。




美最高法院驳回人工智能“发明人”的诉讼

之前我们 报道 过，Thaler 称其 DABUS 系统（统一智能的自主引导装置的简称）完全靠自己创造了独特的饮料架和应急灯的原型。然而美国专利商标局和弗吉尼亚州的一位联邦法官 拒绝 了他的发明专利申请，理由是 DABUS 不是一个人。在上诉至美国最高法院后，法院驳回了该诉讼。


消息来源：路透社



老王点评：我也反对将 AI 作为发明人的做法，毕竟现在的 AI 还只是被人类使用的工具，而不是自主进行的。]]></summary>

	While all of this appears like a lot of work, we are confident in
	our progress and hope to get closer and closer to getting the

	lot of important work remaining in order to produce a valid Rust

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[这篇简单指南演示了在 Ubuntu 和其他 Linux 发行版中验证 ISO 文件过程。


从互联网下载操作系统镜像文件或软件有时会带来安全风险，因为恶意行为者可能会损坏或修改文件。为保证下载文件的真实性和完整性，需要对其进行校验。在本初学者指南中，我们将引导你在 Linux 中验证 ISO 文件。

什么是 ISO 文件？

ISO 文件通常用于创建可启动媒体、安装软件和创建备份。ISO 文件包含压缩格式的所有原始应用/光盘数据，可以轻松下载并通过互联网共享。

例如，如果你下载 Ubuntu 桌面、服务器或任何其他 Linux 操作系统，你一定遇到过扩展名为 .iso 的文件。它还用于应用或其他操作系统，例如 Windows。

为什么要验证 ISO 文件？

验证 ISO 文件对于确保下载的文件真实且未被修改至关重要。修改后的 ISO 文件可能包含可能损害你系统的恶意软件或病毒。验证 ISO 文件可确保下载的文件与开发人员创建的文件相同且未被篡改。

例如，几年前 Linux Mint 服务器被黑 并且官方 ISO 文件被修改。由于你是从官方网站下载的，你可能会认为这些文件是真实的，但它们不一定是。

因此，在使用 ISO 文件安装到你的笔记本电脑/台式机之前，始终验证 ISO 文件非常重要。

在 Linux 中验证 ISO 文件的方法

Linux 中校验 ISO 文件的常用方法有两种：


使用 SHA-256 校验和

使用 GPG 签名


使用 SHA-256 校验和

SHA-256 是一种加密哈希函数，可为文件生成唯一的哈希值。校验和是将 SHA-256 算法应用于文件的结果。校验和是一个唯一的字符串，可用于验证文件的完整性。

要使用 SHA-256 校验和验证 ISO 文件，请从开发者网站下载 SHA-256 …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[近年，美国计算机科学家、视觉艺术家、计算机哲学作家及未来学家杰伦·拉尼尔（Jaron Lanier）与微软新英格兰研究院的经济学家格伦·魏尔（Glen Weyl）提出了“数据尊严”概念，强调个人有权控制和管理自己的数据，以确保数据的安全性、私密性，并保护其免受滥用或未经授权的访问。


4月20日，拉尼尔在《纽约客》发表标题为“没有人工智能（There Is No AI）”的文章，提出应停止对人工智能的神化，而将其作为一种创新的社会协作形式来看待。他反对最近呼吁停止训练更高级人工智能的联署信，并再次提出“数据尊严”概念：结束人工智能黑箱，记录比特的来源，“人们可以为他们创造的东西获得报酬，即使这些东西是通过大模型过滤和重新组合的”，“当一个大模型提供有价值的输出时，数据尊严的方法将追踪最独特和有影响力的贡献者。”


拉尼尔认为，每一个新的人工智能或机器人应用的成功引入，都可能涉及一种新的创造性工作的开始。无论大小，这可以帮助缓和向整合了大模型的经济的过渡。


杰伦·拉尼尔被认为是虚拟现实领域的开创者，2014年，他被Prospect杂志评为世界前50名思想家之一。2018年，他被《连线》评为过去25年技术史上最具影响力的25人之一。以下为《纽约客》上述文章的翻译，为方便阅读和理解已做少量删减。



杰伦·拉尼尔1985年离开雅达利公司，成立了第一家销售VR眼镜和有线手套的公司VPL Research。2006年，他开始在微软工作，从2009年起作为跨学科科学家在微软研究院工作。作为一名计算机科学家，我不喜欢“人工智能”这个词。事实上，我认为它具有误导性——也许甚至有点危险。每个人都已经在使用这个词，而现在争论这个问题可能显得有点晚。但我们正处于一个新技术时代的开端——误解很容易导致误导。


“人工智能”这个术语有着悠久的历史——它是在1950年…]]></summary>

偶尔治愈（to cure sometimes），
常常缓解（to relieve often），
总是安慰（to comfort always）。
近年来，这句来自西方的谚语时常被人用以说明医学的“温度”：医学不应仅仅包含治疗的技术，更要有人文的关怀。有些人将这句话归于古希腊医学之父希波克拉底名下，有些人则宣称它出自一位十九世纪医生的墓碑。这些说法多是以讹传讹，并无实据。这句话更可能只是源自十五世纪欧洲的一句民谚，它最初或许并没有现代医学所赋予的深刻意涵，而只是一种对当时的医学状况带有些许讽刺意味的描述，通俗地讲，就是医生并没有多少有效手段去治愈疾病。正如伏尔泰不无揶揄地说道：医学的技艺就是在疾病自然痊愈的过程中去逗病人开心。
世界医学史上的“治疗革命”大约发生于二十世纪上半叶，以抗生素为代表的一系列特效药的发现为人类战胜疾病带来了曙光。西欧十六、十七世纪解剖学的发展与十九世纪“卫生的大觉醒”固然令人印象深刻，但如以“治疗”为标准，直到二十世纪的现代医学才在疗效上彻底超越各种传统医学，并逐步在世界各地的医疗体系中占据支配地位。现代医学不仅带来了更多有效的疗法与药物，医生和病人的权利关系、疾病和身体的认知也被彻底转变了。医生成了受人尊敬的职业，病人逐渐在医疗场景下失语；身体的秘密被解剖刀揭开，而致病微生物则在显微镜下无所遁形。在现代观念的影响下，二十世纪之前的医学和医病关系仿佛带有些许陌生和怪异。但无论是“人类最大之福祉”还是“荒诞医学史”都仅仅展现了其中的一个面向，理解医学与健康的问题也从不是那么非黑即白。

作为近现代学术史上的失踪者，史学家陆懋德近年来开始逐渐重新得到重视。学术界不仅出现了多篇关于陆氏著作的学术论文（如叶建：《略论陆懋德的史学思想》，《史学集刊》2007年第6期；陈默：《陆懋德〈史学方法大纲〉之渊源探析——以所受伯伦汉的影响为中心》，《理论界》2009年第5期；武树轻：《陆懋德的综合史观》，《宜宾学院学报》2011年第11期；刘永祥《陆懋德〈中国史学史〉的特点和价值》，《史学理论与史学史学刊》2013年卷，总第11卷；等等），也出现了诸如郭福生撰《陆懋德学术研究》硕士论文（华东师范大学，2007）。但陆氏的著作在1949年后很长时间内，大陆仅北京师范大学史学研究所资料室和上海书店印行过《史学方法大纲》，以至于周勋初先生在《艰辛与欢乐相随——周勋初治学经验谈》中感慨道：
梁启超与吕思勉的书都曾重印过多次，方法方面的书都不难求得，陆懋德的专著《史学方法大纲》却是命运多舛，未能广为流传，殊为可惜。民国时期，陆氏在北京各大学主讲史学方法多年，后在讲义的基础上勒成此书。1947年时，由独立出版社于重庆出版；1969年时，台湾阳明出版社重印过一次；1980年时，北京师范大学史学研究所资料室又重印过一次，但以内部发行的方式流通。三处印数都很少，影响也就有限。实则此书虽篇幅无多，内容却甚为精粹。陆氏对中西史学都有很深的了解，其中介绍西方史学的优胜之处，大家对之可能比较陌生，有人囿于过去所受的教育，或许难以接受。实则它山之石，可以攻玉，他人确有其长处，我等自应参考。有人称陈寅恪之史学成就‘较乾嘉诸老更上一层’，评陈垣则曰‘不为乾嘉作殿军’，即以二人曾受西方史学影响之故，那今人又怎能弃之不顾？……陆氏在申论外考证中之校勘法与辨伪法时，有许多细致的分析，且能详引我国史学中的名著加以比较，举例亦甚精当，而在论及内考证时，也有许多细致的分析，情况类同。这种论方法的书，可以让人…]]></summary>

埃隆·马斯克的前女友 Grimes 是一位加拿大创作型歌手，她邀请粉丝用她的声音创作音乐，并表示她只收取人工智能生成的歌曲一半的版税。她说，“请自由使用我的声音，不受惩罚。我没有标签，也没有法律约束”。她与埃隆·马斯克的第一个孩子的名字是 “X Æ A-12”，是用精灵语拼写的 “AI”。2020 年，她与算法情绪音乐创业公司 Endel 合作，为这个孩子创作了一首人工智能生成的摇篮曲。

亚马逊开始悄悄拥抱开源

在对待开源的态度上，亚马逊以一种利用而不奉献的态度而饱受批评，甚至因此导致了 MongoDB、ElasticSearch 等开源软件针对这种情况专门创建了新的许可证。一些 AWS 服务团队不愿做出贡献，以免他们透露太多关于他们的系统如何运行、或为竞争对手提供错误修复、或使亚马逊自己的服务与众不同的功能。这也导致亚马逊只能维护自己的分支，并积累了大量的技术债。然而，现在 PostgreSQL 提交者页面上挤满了 AWS 员工，还有一些原来的提交者被 AWS 聘用从事 PostgreSQL 开发。其它一些原本 AWS 贡献者为零的开源项目，现在也开始零星有一些亚马逊贡献者出现。

老王点评：有些企业把开源当成形象工程，当成是单纯的惠及他人的行为，其实是错误的认识。




稳定 AI 公司推出开源 ChatGPT 替代品

推出“稳定扩散”开源图像合成模型的稳定 AI 公司，发布了一个新的开源 AI 语言模型系列 StableLM。它目前在 GitHub 上以 alpha 版的形式提供 30 亿和 70 亿参数的模型，随后将会发布 150 亿和 650 亿参数的模型。该公司在知识共享 BY-SA-4.0 许可下发布了这些模型。StableLM 声称与 OpenAI 的基准 GPT-3 模型性能相似，而使用的参数却少得多，StableLM 为 70 亿，而 GPT-3 为 1750 亿。

当人们得知我是位（专注于 syslog-ng 和 sudo 的）开源布道师的时候，他们经常问我为 Linux 世界中如此知名的软件“代言”是什么感觉。我的回答非常简短：非常棒！

我是整个研发环节的一部分，所以我不会觉得自己可有可无。当人们实践我教他们的东西，以及当我收集到的用户反馈影响产品开发的时候，我感觉我很有意义。

什么是布道师？

我将布道师定义为软件（或其他产品）的用户和开发人员之间的桥梁。布道师不仅仅将好消息分享给用户，还要从他们那里收集反馈。

布道师们有着各式各样的背景：有些人具有市场营销背景，对技术有着浓厚的兴趣；有些人是喜欢和用户交流的开发人员。我属于第三类——“资深用户”，即从用户视角对软件产品有深入了解的人。

我要和非常多的用户打交道。syslog-ng 的用户群体非常庞大，它可以用在大多数 Linux 发行版和 BSD 变体上。数以亿计的设备运行着 syslog-ng，其中包括 BMW i3 和 Kindle。大多数基于 BSD 的设备，譬如 FreeNAS，使用 syslog-ng 记录日志，而 Synology 和 QNAP 的基于 Linux 的网络附属存储Network Attached Storage（NAS）也是如此。就算 syslog-ng 运行在太空的某处，我也不会感到惊讶。

大多数 Linux 和 Unix 用户使用 sudo，因为它几乎被安装在每一台 Linux 设备上。它的社区很大，有几千万人。人们经常问我是如何和那么多用户打交道的，但这并不困难。

我是如何成为一名布道师的

我成为布道师的旅程是一个跨越了近 20 年的进化过程。它始于许多年前，那时候我在大学教书。之后是和 POWER/PowerPC 的 Linux 用户、开发人员合作。最后，我…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[你可能知道，Linux Mint 是一个基于 Ubuntu 的发行版。

Ubuntu 每六个月发布一个新版本，但 Linux Mint 并不遵循六个月一次的发行模式。

Linux Mint 以 Ubuntu LTS（长期支持long term support）版本作为其基础。Ubuntu 的 LTS 版本每两年发布一次，所以 你也会每两年得到一个 Mint 的大版本更新（比如 Mint 19, 20, 21 等）。

与 Ubuntu LTS 版本一样，Linux Mint 的大版本也被支持五年。虽然在这期间有三个小更新版本（比如 Mint 20.1、20.2、20.3）。

与 Ubuntu 相比，多久能得到一次 Linux Mint 的升级？你应该在什么时候等待 Linux Mint 的升级？当有新版本的时候，你应该升级到新版本吗？

在这里，让我重点介绍一下这些 Linux Mint 的发行周期的重要细节。

Linux Mint 的发行周期

Ubuntu 每两年发布一个长期支持版本。之后很快就会有一个 Mint 版本出现。换句话说，你每两年就会得到一个新的 Mint 版本。

所以，Linux Mint 20 是在 2020 年基于 Ubuntu 20.04 发行的，Mint 21 是在 2022 年基于 Ubuntu 22.04 发行的。

与 Ubuntu 不同，Mint 没有严格的发行时间表。没有事先确定的发行日期。新版本在其开发者认为准备好的时候就会到来。

小版本

在 Mint 的两个大版本发布之间，有三个小版本，每隔 6 个月发布一次。

即 Mint 20（即 20.0）是在 2020 年 6 月发布的。Mint 20.1 在 2020 年 12 月，Mint 20.2 在 2021 年 6 月，Mint 20.3 在 …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[智能音箱应该学会闭嘴

谷歌本周宣布，它将采取更多措施，阻止在你向 Nest 智能音箱发送命令时对你喋喋不休。当你要求它关闭你所在房间的灯光时，它会保持沉默，发出轻柔的铃声，让你知道它已经成功。这个新变化将在未来几周内推出。然而，这些智能音箱有时候还是忍不住多嘴，比如你要它改变恒温器的温度时，它仍然喜欢和你好好聊一聊；轻声请求它关闭客厅的灯时，它仍然会大声喊道：“关闭客厅的灯！”


消息来源：The Verge



老王点评：没有接入 ChatGPT 的“智能”音箱只是个语音助手而已，期待接入 ChatGPT 后，这些“智能”设备真的有了智能。




ARM 将自己制造芯片

ARM 此前和三星和台积电等公司合作制造过测试芯片，主要是帮助软件开发商熟悉新产品。它在过去半年开发的新芯片比以往“更先进”，针对目标是芯片制造商而不是软件开发商。ARM 此举在行业内部引发了担忧，如果它寻求出售其芯片，那么它将与其最主要客户高通和联发科展开直接竞争。ARM 内部人士否认该公司计划出售或授权新芯片，称该公司只是在开发原型。


消息来源：路透社



老王点评：亲自下场，未必是好事。可能是做给资本市场看的吧。




PyPI 将推出收费的组织账户

非营利性的 Python 软件基金会宣布，为了“PyPI 的长期可持续性，同时给我们的用户提供我们最需要的功能之一：组织账户”。组织账户有自己专属的品牌网络地址。目标是让大型社区项目、组织或管理多个子团队和多个软件包的公司更容易使用 PyPI。组织账户将向社区项目永久免费，而对于企业项目收取少量费用。所有的收入将直接回馈给 PyPI，用于雇佣专职员工以提供更好的服务。PyPI 强调，这些新功能是完全可选的。

老王点评：看得出来 Python 基金会很小心翼翼的尝试可持续发展的改变。]]></summary>

两种微软产品可以很好地融合在一起。你可以在 VS Code 中无缝编码并将更改推送到你的 GitHub 仓库。从同一个应用界面完成所有这些工作让生活变得如此轻松。

如何将 GitHub 添加到 VS Code？ 其实很容易。

在本教程中，我将展示：


如何将你的 GitHub 帐户集成到 VS Code 中

如何将仓库从 GitHub 克隆到 VS Code 中

如何将你的更改从 VS Code 推送到 GitHub


听起来不错？让我们看看如何去做。

先决条件

请确保你的计算机上安装了 Git。怎么做？

一种方法是转到 VS Code 中的源代码管理视图。如果未安装 Git，它会要求你下载它。



另一件事是你需要配置 Git 用户名和电子邮件。

将 GitHub 添加到 VS Code

VS Code 内置了 GitHub 集成。你不需要安装任何扩展来克隆仓库和推送你的更改。

从左侧边栏转到源代码选项卡。你应该看到 “克隆仓库Clone Repository” 或 “发布到 GitHubPublish to GitHub”（如果你已经打开了一个文件夹）选项。单击 “克隆仓库Clone Repository” 并为其提供 GitHub 仓库链接或单击 “从 GitHub 克隆Clone from GitHub”。



然后它会显示一条消息，要求你登录 GitHub。



你单击“允许Allow”按钮，它将打开 GitHub 登录页面。



如果你尝试克隆一个仓库，你应该会看到这样的消息并单击 “打开Open”。



这应该需要几秒钟，你就会登录到你的 GitHub 帐户。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Proton 8.0 已经到来，带来了一些改进，以提升 Linux 游戏体验。


Proton 8.0 的到来改进了 Linux 游戏体验。

（LCTT 译注：Proton 是 V 社开发的兼容层，可以让 Windows 游戏在 Linux 上运行。它是一个软件集合，扩展了流行的 API 翻译层 Wine，提供高性能和低开销的 Vulkan API。）



Proton 一直是 Linux 游戏玩家的福音，它使 Steam 客户端能够在 Linux 上运行 Windows 生态系统独有的游戏。

基于流行的 Wine 兼容层，Valve 多年来一直为 Proton 提供更新。

Proton 8.0 的发布带来了一些令人印象深刻的升级，标志着 Linux 游戏又迈出了重要一步。

让我们一起来一探究竟。

Proton 8.0 有啥新鲜事儿： Proton 的新版本增加了对许多新游戏的兼容支持和对现有游戏的错误修复。

例如，一些现有游戏，如 《极限竞速：地平线 5Forza Horizon 5》、《车祸模拟器BeamNG》、《真人快打 XMortal Combat X》、《最终幻想 14Final Fantasy XIV Online》、《汤姆·克兰西的细胞分裂Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell》都得到了不同程度的修复，使它们比之前表现更好。

刚刚提到的新支持的游戏呢？



最具期待的一些游戏包括：


《仁王 2 完整版Nioh 2 – The Complete Edition》

《海贼无双 4One Piece: Pirate Warriors 4》

《死亡空间 2023Dead Space (2023)》

《魔咒之地Forspoken》

《无双大蛇 3 终极版WARRIORS OROCHI 3 Ultimate Definitive Edition》


此外，还有一些改进会对 Steam Deck 用户有所帮助，包括：


改进了 Steam Deck 上 《小缇娜的奇幻之地Tiny Tina's Wonderland》 的睡眠/恢复功能

改进了多点触控支持


对技术细节更感兴趣？

Proton 8.0 基于最近发布的 Wine 8.0，它可以提供更好的 WoW64 32 位支持、提升了 Direct3D 性能、增强了对游戏控制器及方向盘的支持等等。

你可以查看我们的报道以深入了解。

除此之外，此版本还引入了针对 GNOME 43 上的 Alt+Tab 问题、为游戏启用了英伟达 API、附带的 dxvk v2.1-4-gcaf31033 等的修复程序。

你或许想通过 发行说明 来探索随 Proton 8.0 一起提供的有关技术变更和游戏的详细列表。

想上手试试？



如果你使用 Steam，你可以按照我们的指南了解如何在 Linux 上设置 Steam Play （Proton）并开始 在 Linux 上玩游戏。

不过，需要注意的是，随着 Proton 8.0 的发布，要想顺利运行系统需要 至少支持 Vulkan 1.3 的 GPU。

你还可以查看 GitHub 代码库，了解如何从源代码手动安装它。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Why can’t we have mobile “phones” that are just clients for a much more powerful vps somewhere. Add in a 4g/5G antenna for mobile internet and calling and u have a cheap phone that you can scale in the cloud! Maybe this exists already, in which case pls link me. Imagine an open source os that u can install on any android type device and using its internet connection it used it’s private vps to run everything, this way there won’t be software limitations on mobile devices and companies can just offer different tiers of vps specs with a cheaply made device. I bet this would be able to take advantage of decentralized communication networks much better than a normal iPhone 
 Anyone tryna tentatively start a new open source thingy?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Linus has released the 6.3 kernel as
expected.


	It's been a calm release this time around, and the last week was
	really no different. So here we are, right on schedule, with the
	6.3 release out and ready for your enjoyment.

	That doesn't mean that something nasty couldn't have been lurking
	all these weeks, of course, but let's just take things at face
	value and hope it all means that everything is fine, and it really
	was a nice controlled release cycle. It happens.


Significant changes in this release include
the removal of a lot of obsolete Arm board files and drivers,
ongoing improvements to the (still minimal) Rust language support,
red-black trees for BPF programs,
ID-mapped mounts for tmpfs filesystems,
BIG TCP support for IPv4,
support for non-executable memfds,
the hwnoise
jitter-measurement tool,
and a lot more.  See the LWN merge-window summaries
(part 1,
part 2) and the (in-progress) KernelNewbies 6.3 page for
more information.]]></summary>

关于反间谍法修订草案（三次审议稿），臧铁伟介绍，2022年8月第十三届全国人大常委会第三十六次会议和12月第三十八次会议对反间谍法修订草案进行了两次审议。根据各方面意见，提请本次常委会会议审议的修订草案三次审议稿拟作几点主要修改。


一：完善关于网络间谍行为的规定，针对信息网络的特点，明确间谍组织及其代理人等针对国家机关、涉密单位或者关键信息基础设施等的网络攻击、侵入、干扰、控制、破坏等活动，属于间谍行为。


二：平衡赋权与限权，增加救济程序，规定经采取相关措施，涉及间谍行为的网络安全风险或者信息内容已经消除的，有关部门应当及时作出恢复传输和相关服务的决定。


臧铁伟介绍，2022年12月，十三届全国人大常委会第三十八次会议后，反间谍法修订草案二次审议稿等相关法律草案在中国人大网公开，征求社会公众意见。反间谍法修订草案二次审议稿通过中国人大网共收到112人提出的201条意见。普遍认为，修订反间谍法是完善国家安全法律制度体系的重大举措，修订草案坚持问题导向，丰富完善了反间谍工作职权、工作保障，与其他法律法规进行了有效衔接，为打击间谍违法犯罪活动，维护国家主权、安全和发展利益，提供了坚强的法治保障。社会公众就进一步修改完善修订草案提出的意见，主要集中在几个方面：


一.完善间谍行为的定义，增加有关网络间谍的规定。


二.明确国家安全机关指导安排宣传教育的职责。


三.平衡反间谍工作与保护个人、组织合法权益之间的关系，加强在反间谍工作中对个人信息的保护。

之前，我们 报道 过，Rust 基金会准备修改其商标政策，禁止 Rust 相关的工具和用 Rust 开发的软件的名称中使用 “Rust” 一词。这导致了社区的巨大抗议，有人批评该政策“远远偏离了法律上允许的公平使用”。Rust 语言的创建者也对这些反对意见表示了公开支持。现在 Rust 基金会承认提议的政策“显然需要改进”，并承诺将解决这些问题，采取更透明的程序。一位前 Rust 核心团队成员认为，过去一年 Rust 管理层的动荡导致了一个与 Rust 社区打交道经验不足的团队。


消息来源：The Register



老王点评：这么荒唐的政策，可见负责这些事情的人有多脱离实际。




ChatGPT 生成的大部分代码是不安全的，但你不问它不说

研究人员让 ChatGPT 使用 C、C++、Python 和 Java 四种语言生成了 21 个程序和脚本，分析了所生成代码的安全性，结果表明部分代码甚至达不到最低安全标志。而且 ChatGPT 似乎知道它生成的代码是不安全的，但如果你不问它，它是不会说的。在进一步提示纠正其错误步骤后，它设法产生了七个更安全的应用程序，虽然不能断言没有其它安全漏洞。


消息来源：The Register



老王点评：不用担心，它只是“工作”不用心罢了，只要好好督促就行了。




Stack Overflow 也将向 AI 训练收费

之前我们 报道 过，Reddit 将对利用其内容训练 AI 进行收费，现在 Stack Overflow 表示对 Reddit 的做法非常支持。他们计划最快在今年 6 月开始向大型人工智能开发者收费，以获得其 5000 万个问题和答案。他们认为潜在的额外收入对于确保 Stack Overflow 能够不断吸引用户和维持高质量的信息至关重要。有趣的是，Stack Overflow 称，LLM 开发者违反了其服务条款，因为这些问题和答案均采用知识共享许可，要求以后使用这些数据的人提到其来源，而 AI 并没有提及。


消息来源：Wired



老王点评：虽然分一杯羹的想法可以理解，但是基于知识共享的内容，你收费合规吗？]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[据彭博社记者Mark Gurman报道，苹果在iOS 17中首次允许iPhone用户下载其官方App Store以外的应用程序。也就是所谓的侧载，这一变化将允许客户在不需要使用App Store的情况下下载应用，这意味着开发者如若不在苹果应用商店上架程序就不需要支付苹果公司15%到30%的费用。


欧盟《数字市场法》（DMA）于2022年11月1日生效，要求"守门人"公司向其他公司和开发者开放其服务和平台。


DMA将对苹果的平台产生很大影响，它可能导致苹果对App Store、信息、FaceTime、Siri等部件做出重大改变。据Gurman称，苹果正计划在明年之前实施侧载支持，以符合欧洲的新规定。


苹果公司一直以来声称，侧载机制的加入将"破坏iPhone用户依赖的隐私和安全保护"，使人们容易受到恶意软件、诈骗、数据跟踪和其他问题的影响。然而，苹果公司必须遵守DMA的规定，否则如果违反欧盟法律，它将面临高达其全球收入20%的罚款。


在2022年12月的一份报告中，Gurman说，苹果正在考虑实施安全要求，如验证，这个过程它可以收取费用，而不是从直接销售应用程序中收钱。苹果在Mac上有一个验证系统，可以让用户在安全的同时获得Mac应用商店之外的应用。


如果其他国家出台类似的立法，这种做法可能会扩展到欧盟之外。例如，美国正在考虑立法，要求苹果允许侧载。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Kubuntu 23.04 已经到达，并带有 KDE Plasma 5.27。


如果你正在寻找一个基于 KDE 的发行版，毋庸置疑 Kubuntu 作为 Ubuntu 的官方风味版就是其中一个。

在 Kubuntu 23.04 中，你可以期待增强的 KDE 体验和其他一些改进。

让我带你了解一下 Kubuntu 23.04 版本的亮点。


💡 Kubuntu 23.04 将被支持 九个月，直到 2024 年 1 月。如果你想要在其寿命结束后得到一个最新的、安全的系统，你可以升级到 Kubuntu 23.10（即将发布）。


🆕 Kubuntu 23.04：有什么新内容？



Kubuntu 23.04 版本中的一些特色部分包括：


KDE Plasma 5.27

Flatpak 被移除

Discover 的改进

Plasma Wayland 会话（测试）

默认采用 Pipewire

KDE 应用程序更新



📋 这 *不是 一个 长期支持 版本。所以，对于大多数人来说，不需要升级。只有当你想要最新和最好的 Linux 发行版，同时愿意在一年内再次升级的时候，才该选择它。


KDE Plasma 5.27 LTS

KDE Plasma 5.27 是 KDE 6 到来之前最后一个 5.x 系列的版本。

因此，随着最新的 KDE Plasma 桌面的到来，你可以期待所有的改进都已就绪。比如说，增强的多显示器支持、新的欢迎屏幕，以及其他用户界面的改进，其中一些我将单独提及。

如果你想了解关于 KDE Plasma 5.27 的所有内容，我们的之前的报道应该能给你更好的介绍：


给 KDE 用户的情人节礼物：Plasma 5.27


Flatpak 支持被移除

Kubuntu 默认包括 Flatpak。然而，最近 Canonical 决定 对所有 Ubuntu 风味版默认放弃 Flatpak 支持，Kubuntu 23.04 也不例外。



你可以手动 添加 Flatpak，但你会发现它不是开箱即用的了。

“发现”应用的增强

作为 KDE Plasma 5.27 的一部分，“发现Discover” 应用在列出应用和程序的方式上进行了重大改革。“发现”应用的商店看起来更有活力和更有价值，有了编辑选择区和流行应用区。



此外，你可以通过“发现”应用访问 Flatpak 应用程序的更多权限，并在手动启用后轻松地将 Flatpak 应用程序直接整合到“发现”应用中。



Plasma Wayland 会话（测试）

你现在可以在 Kubuntu 23.04 的登录屏幕上尝试 Wayland 会话。

然而，这只是测试，并不完全支持。

KDE 应用程序更新

KDE 套件的每个部分都收到了版本升级，包括文件管理器、Krunner 和其他。



Krunner，这个启动器现在如果没有找到与你要找的东西相匹配的东西，就会提示进行互联网搜索，如下面的截图所示。



其他完善的功能

你会发现一个新的 Linux 内核 6.2、功能和其他细微的变化。值得一提的亮点包括以下内容：


Pipewire 作为默认的音频服务器

LibreOffice 7.5

Firefox 111 Snap

Qt 5.15.8


你可以参考 发行说明 了解更多技术细节。

📥 下载 Kubuntu 23.04

前往 官方网站 获取最新的 ISO，或者使用 Ubuntu 镜像库 来获取它。


Kubuntu 23.04


如果你已经是 Ubnutu 用户，你可以按照 官方指南 来升级。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[柴念东（章静绘）

著名史学家柴德赓的长孙柴念东先生自2013年以来，一直致力于整理祖父的手稿、日记、书信等，已出版的著作有：《清代学术史讲义》《史籍举要》（修订本）、《史学丛考》（增订本）、《新五代史》（点校本）、《书目答问补正》（批注本）、《柴德赓来往书信》《青峰学志》《宋辽金史讲义资治通鉴介绍》等十余种。最近他出版了《瓣香终不负此生——柴德赓图志》一书，收录了柴德赓相关的档案、文献、笔记、背景图片和照片五百余张，以图片形式介绍了柴德赓的一生。在接受《上海书评》专访时，柴念东谈到了祖父的生平主要经历和他交游的师友。

《瓣香终不负此生——柴德赓图志》，柴念东编著，商务印书馆2023年3月出版，240页，168.00元

能请您谈谈《瓣香终不负此生——柴德赓图志》这本书的写作缘起吗？
柴念东：之前我一直忙于《柴德庚全集》的编纂，其实并没有编写图志的计划。2020年底，苏州大学的朱从兵教授看了全集目录，提了不少选题建议，其中有一条就说到，图志很重要，如果家里收藏老照片的数量足够的话，可以考虑结集成册。2021年，苏大开了一个关于《柴德赓全集》的工作会议，从那时起，我就计划编写这本《柴德赓图志》了。柴德赓先生的老师陈垣先生（字援庵，我们习惯称他为陈援老）有《陈垣图传》，陈援老的学生、柴先生的好友启功先生有《启功图传》。这两部图传都对我起到了参考作用，不过，与《启功图传》这种口述历史搭配个人图片的体例不同，我编写《柴德赓图志》，是根据柴先生经历，将他独家收藏的一千多张照片，外加柴先生一些档案资料的照片，分门别类排列，尽量做得精致一些，凸显设计感。柴先生的一大特点是留下的档案资料很全，比如说他工作以后的聘书现在都藏在苏州大学博物馆，大概有二十多份，不管是在中学还是大学任教的聘书都在。他本人也注重保存照片，大部分照片背面他都留有字迹，说明这张照片的情况。因为资料齐全，所以留给我编写…]]></summary>

 I would like to see some big tech like Samsung or Amazon jump right into Linux and develop a product that can compete with their Macbook and surface equivalents. I believe this would bring a huge boost to our ecosystem. It does not matter which DE is used or even if one is developed. In my view, this would bring returns for all distributions. What do you think?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[那些被你领入社区的人，有一天也会向其他人伸出援手。


开源领导者可以通过创造归属感、提供机会和表示支持来为新来者创造包容性社区。他们了解提交代码和与其他社区成员建立联系的复杂性。创造包容性社区可以建立信誉并获得影响力。这种经验对于想要参与但不知道从哪里开始的贡献者来说是无价的。

几年前，当我开始管理一个活跃于 Linux 内核社区的团队时，我发现自己因为没有任何内核经验而感到处境困难。复杂的代码库、庞大的电子邮件归档和高风险的交流让我感到害怕。当我团队中的新内核开发人员表达了类似的感受时，我意识到我的感觉在团队里普遍存在。对于那些支持贡献者或想自己做出贡献的人来说，入门的道路并不总是清晰的，甚至可能感觉遥不可及。

4 个策略建立包容性领导力

开源领导者可以通过为那些希望融入社区的人创造途径来发挥自己的影响力。本文涵盖的策略可应用于正式的 指导 或 辅导 关系，但同样适用于日常互动。在培养环境的包容性时，看似微不足道的交流往往会产生最重要的影响。

怀着好奇心接近了解新人

经验较少或来自非传统背景的人可能会以意想不到或不同的方式解决问题。在应对这些差异时，如果用妄加评论或批评的方式，可能会在知识曲线通常很陡峭的社区中创造一个不安全的学习环境。例如，Linux 内核的长期贡献者了解社区丰富的历史，这意味着他们不需要明说就能理解社区的决策和反应。新的贡献者必须积累这方面的知识，但只有当他们感到安全，并愿意冒必要的风险来发展自己的技能时，他们才能有效地做到这一点。

开源领导者可以通过带着好奇心去接近新人来支持他们学习。你可以问他们这样的问题，“你能帮我理解一下你为什么采用这种方法吗？”而不是直接宣布提议的解决方案“对或错”。问题打开了一个继续学习的对话，而不是关闭那些值得探索的重要方面的想法。这个过程也拓宽了领导者的视野，他们可以通过考虑新的观点来学习。

发现并分享学习机会

开源领导者可以确定适合其他人的项目，使他们可以获得技术专长和学习社区流程。在为他人创造机会的同时，领导者也为自己创造了更多机会。这是因为他们有更多时间探索新的尝试，同时通过分派任务继续推进他们的工作。随着领导者的成长，他们帮助周围的人取得成功的能力变得与他们的直接贡献一样重要。

要知道 失败 是学习的一部分，因此你要考虑找一些新手失败后不会造成严重后果的项目。例如，在 Linux 内核中，代码库的某些部分的小改动可能会造成灾难性的后果。考虑可以实现小小的胜利的项目，以帮助新来者在没有高风险的情况下建立信心并感到掌控感。通过会议、电子邮件论坛或任何涉及如何参与到社区里的宣传活动分享这些想法，让人们更容易获取到这些信息。

展现你脆弱的一面

拥有更多的经验并不意味着你知道一切。通常情况下，即使是与我共事过的最有经验的 Linux 内核贡献者也会被未知子系统中的新挑战击败。经验不足的社区成员通常会认为经验丰富的社区成员已经了解了一切。但是，经验就是要善于找出你不知道的东西。如果你处于权威地位或者被认为是专家，你可以通过分享个人挣扎和坚持的经验来表现你脆弱的一面，这样做可以鼓励那些和你有着类似感受的人。

为他人做担保

向你的人脉介绍新来的成员。在激发他们兴趣的领域里，让新成员和在这个领域内具有专业知识的社区成员建立联系。在公共论坛上说出他们的名字，并称赞他们所做的出色工作。作为受人尊敬的领导者，你的支持可以帮助他们在社区内建立联系和信任。

通过树立社区包容性，我们可以拥有丰富多样的社区。我希望开源领导者会考虑这些建议，因为你提拔到社区的人未来的某天也会同样向别人伸出援手。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[肯尼亚的论文枪手面临失业

过去九年，27 岁的肯尼亚人 Collins 靠给美国大学生当论文枪手谋生。他撰写的论文主题包括了心理学、社会学和经济学。他偶尔还被允许直接访问大学网站入口，递交考试和作业，参与小组讨论，使用学生身份与教授交谈。2022 年他每月的收入在 900-1200 美元。如今他的月收入降至了 500–800 美元。他认为原因是 ChatGPT 的流行。Collins 担心 AI 的崛起会大幅降低学生对他们这些枪手的依赖，他自己也同时也用 ChatGPT 去生成以前外包给其他枪手的内容。据调查，近半的学生使用 ChatGPT 完成家庭测验和写论文。


消息来源：Rest of World



老王点评：前两天有人建议大学应该恢复面试考试。但是另外一方面，大学教育是否应该改变以将学生培养成 AI 无法取代的人才？




ChatGPT 每日运营成本高达 70 万美元

根据分析师研究，OpenAI 每天花费高达 70 万美元，甚至在推出 GPT-4 后运行成本会更高。虽然训练 ChatGPT 的大型语言模型可能需要花费数千万美元，但在部署任何合理规模的模型时，运营费用或推理成本 “远远超过训练成本”，分析师推断 ChatGPT 的每周的成本都会超过其训练成本。有企业高管开玩笑说，“我们有人类员工和人工智能员工，我们在他们每个人身上的花费差不多”。


消息来源：Business Insider



老王点评：当成本降低下来之后，AI 将占据我们生活中更多的地方。




二手诺基亚 3310 手机现在高达数千美元

利用一部改造过的诺基亚 3310 手机，将其用线缆连接到汽车的 CAN 总线上，没有多少技术经验的小偷可以在 15 秒内盗走一辆丰田陆地巡洋舰。这种新型的汽车盗窃案正在美国各地扩散，导致的一个结果是诺基亚 3310 手机的价格飙升到了 3000-4000 美元。这种攻击技术也可用于盗窃豪车如玛莎拉蒂和雷克萨斯。除了手机，一些蓝牙音箱也可以这样改造。目前汽车厂商对此还没有好的对策。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ubuntu 23.04 增加了 GNOME 44 的魔力，并有一些自己的调整和改进。请看下文。




每年的这个时候，都会有新的 Ubuntu 版本发布：Ubuntu 23.04 来了。

然而，这并不是一个 长期支持版本。所以，代号为 月球龙虾Lunar Lobster 的 Ubuntu 23.04 并不适合所有人。

如果你想要最新和最棒的发行版，并且不介意在一年内再次升级你的系统，那么这个版本适合你。而如果你想在几年内坚持使用一个版本，你应该继续使用 Ubuntu 20.04 LTS 或 Ubuntu 22.04 LTS。

现在，继续说说 Ubuntu 23.04 的亮点：


💡 Ubuntu 23.04 将被支持 九个月，直到 2024 年 1 月。如果你想在其寿命结束后得到一个最新的安全系统，你可以升级到 Ubuntu 23.10（即将推出的版本）。


⭐ Ubuntu 23.04：有什么新内容？



该版本最重要的改进包括以下内容：


新的现代化安装程序

Steam Snap 晋升为稳定版

GNOME 44

文件管理器的改进

Linux 内核 6.2

传统和最小化 ISO

新的 Cinnamon 风味版



📋 这 不是 一个 长期支持 版本。因此，对于大多数人来说，你不需要升级。只有当你想要最新的和最棒的 Linux 发行版，同时愿意在一年内再次升级的时候，它才是你要的。


基于 Flutter 的默认安装程序



Canonical 一直在开发一个由 Subiquity 支持的现代化的安装程序，它的外观感觉看起来不错。

这个安装程序被打包成了一个 Snap 包，而最小化的安装方式在这个新改造下也变得更快。

这个新的安装程序还旨在向新用户提供有意义的信息，同时改善…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[建立良好的文档可能是困难的，但它对有效的沟通至关重要。遵循这个框架来编写并与正确的人分享文档。


成功和可持续的项目，与那些消失无踪的项目有什么不同？答案是 —— 社区。社区是开源项目的发展动力，而文档是构建社区的基石之一。也就是说，文档的意义不仅仅在于文档本身。

建立好的文档可能很困难。用户不愿意阅读文档，因为它不易查找，它很快就过时了，它冗长，或者它不全面。

开发团队不写文档，因为他们陷入了“对我来说显而易见，所以对所有人都显而易见”的陷阱。他们不写，因为他们忙于开发项目。要么是需求变化太快了，要么是开发得还不够快。

但是好的文档仍然是团队和项目之间最好的沟通工具。考虑到项目随着时间的推移往往会变得更大，这一点尤其重要。

文档可以是团队或公司内部的唯一真理。这在协调人们朝着共同的目标前进，以及在人们转移到不同的项目时保留知识方面非常重要。

那么，要如何为一个项目写出合适的文档，并与正确的人分享呢？

什么是成功的社区文档？

要想在你的社区文档编写中取得成功，你需要：


规划你的路径

使其清晰简单

灵活变通，根据具体情况调整路径

做版本控制




灵活并不意味着混乱。许多项目之所以成功，就是因为它们组织得很好。

James Clear（《原子习惯Atomic Habits》一书的作者）写道：“你并不是提升到了你目标所在的水平，而是降低到你整个系统所在的水平。”一定要组织好过程，使水平足够高，才能取得成功。

设计流程

文档本身就是一个项目。你可以把写文档当作写代码一样。事实上，文档可以是一个产品，而且是一个非常有价值的产品。

这就意味着你可以采用与软件开发相同的流程：分析、获取需求、设计、实现和维护，把文档作为你的一个流程对待。

在设计流程时，要从不同的角度考虑。不是所有的文档都适用于所有人。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[...for server applications.
 Snaps are a really easy way for me to get something running immediately without any tinkering or installation at all, and for it to keep itself up-to-date without intervention.
 I have a Nextcloud server. I installed it using a single command, snap install nextcloud and it started running itself after that and keeps itself up to date. Similarly, I installed Bitcoin Core the same way, which is a piece of software that is rather important to keep up to date.
 I understand that Docker does the same thing, and probably more, but in terms of simplicity and ease of use, I find Snap's "install and forget" nature very attractive. A single command does everything without any need for configuration. As an amateur, I really appreciated that it distils the process of installing Nextcloud from a two-hour manual install process to a single terminal command. It's pretty great, and I respect it for that, even with all its other flaws.
 (I am not being paid by Canonical to write this. Canonical's unilateral control over Snap and heavy-handed approach is problematic in its own right but that is unrelated to the underlying technology)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[在科技公司对人工智能赛道的争夺进入白热化之际，谷歌实施一项重大重组，合并了两个主要的人工智能研究部门：DeepMind与Google Brain，组成Google DeepMind。


Alphabet和谷歌CEO桑德尔·皮查伊（Sundar Pichai ）当地时间4月20日在一篇博文中表示，合并后的团队将“显著加快我们在AI方面的进步。”


DeepMind首席执行官德米斯·哈萨比斯（Demis Hassabis）将担任Google DeepMind的首席执行官，皮查伊表示，哈萨比斯将“领导开发我们最有能力和负责任的通用人工智能系统”。同时，负责监督Google Brain团队的前谷歌研究与健康部门（Google Research and Health）高级副总裁、Brain团队联合创始人杰夫·迪恩（Jeff Dean）将任Google Research和Google DeepMind首席科学家一职。


皮查伊在博文中说：“在谷歌计算资源的支持下，将所有这些人才整合成一个专注的团队，将大大加快我们在人工智能方面的进展。”


“通过与谷歌产品领域优秀同事的密切合作，我们有机会提供人工智能研究和产品，从而显著改善数十亿人的生活、改变行业、推动科学发展并服务于多元化社区。”哈萨比斯在写给员工的备忘录里说， “通过创建 Google DeepMind，我相信我们可以更快地实现那个未来。以安全和负责任的方式构建更强大和通用的人工智能，要求我们解决我们这个时代一些最艰巨的科学和工程挑战。”


谷歌和微软支持的OpenAI等科技公司一直在竞相构建越来越强大的大型语言模型。这些程序已经展现了在多种任务上的潜力，譬如对复杂文档进行摘要和进行类似人类的对话。谷歌开创了为此类模型发展铺平道路的技术，比如Transformer，但又在很大程度上阻止了其最强大的图像和文本生成程序的公开发布，理由是需要测试工具的准确性和偏见问题。3月，谷歌开放了与ChatGPT和必应聊天机器人竞争的Bard的抢先体验，还为开发人员开放了对其最大的AI 算法之一——PaLM的有限访问权限。本周又有消息称，谷歌正在构建一个由人工智能技术驱动的全新搜索引擎，将提供更个性化的用户体验，试图预测用户的需求。


总部位于英国的DeepMind创建于2010年，由德米斯·哈萨比斯和其他人创办。2014年，DeepMind开始开发人工智能围棋软件AlphaGo，这款全球闻名的软件击败了李世石等世界冠军。2016年，DeepMind将其人工智能研究转向蛋白质折叠，2022年，其开发的AlphaFold已经预测了全球几乎所有的蛋白质结构。


Alphabet在2014年以大约5亿美元收购了DeepMind，长期以来一直将Google Brain和DeepMind视为独立的团队，尽管它们在AI研究的几个领域有很大的重叠。这种设置有时会在领导者之间造成紧张关系，因为各部门会争夺资源等。


斯坦福人工智能实验室主任克里斯托弗·曼宁（Christopher Manning）对《华尔街日报》表示，考虑到Google Brain和DeepMind的不同文化，此次合并将标志着谷歌人工智能研究人员合作方式的“巨大转变”。“从战略上讲，合并似乎是明智的。”曼宁说， “从战术上讲，管理组织和文化变革将变得困难。”

一、后冷战时代与普适性现代化理论
当人类历史即将走完被霍布斯鲍姆（Eric Hobsbawm）称为“极端的年代”的二十世纪，发生的重大事件就是东欧剧变和苏联解体，长期对立的美苏冷战格局解体，如何理解这一事件，成为当时西方社会科学领域关心的重要问题。
这场大讨论令福山（Francis Fukuyama）一跃成为新保守主义阵营炙手可热的学者。他在1989年为《国家利益》（The National Interest）杂志夏季号撰写的一篇题为“历史的终结？”（The End of History）的文章，随后发生的东欧剧变和苏联解体，福山凭借此文迅速暴得大名。福山曾于1981年在哈佛大学获得政治学博士学位，师从著名政治学家亨廷顿（Samuel Huntington），福山长期关注苏联东欧问题研究，其在哈佛大学的博士论文研究的即是冷战时期苏联对中东的外交政策。当时他在美国国务院思想库担任政策企划局副局长，此前曾在美国著名的决策咨询公司兰德公司（Rand Corporation）担任研究员，这篇文章源自他在芝加哥大学的一次演讲，这次演讲曾得到施特劳斯（Leo Strauss）学派的重要代表人物阿兰·布鲁姆（Allan bloom）的支持。在该文中，福山开篇谈到当时普遍关注的重要问题，如何理解当时发生在东欧、拉美和亚洲和撒哈拉以南的非洲正在进行的民主转型运动，福山认为大多数分析家由于缺乏概念框架，无法理解这些事件究竟只是一种历史偶然还是显示历史的必然。
在该文以及随后扩展成为《历史的终结与最后的人》的著作中，福山当时的核心观点实质上很简单，他认为若从宏大的哲学意义的历史而言，这些事件展现出完全不同于左派思想家所预想的结局，经济现代化和政治现代化的过程并未像马克思主义者所…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[《诗经》好，《卫风》尤好。《卫风》是邶、鄘、卫三地歌诗的合称，许穆夫人所赋《载驰》是卫风中的佳篇，背后的故事也精彩。

东晋顾恺之（传）绘《列女图卷》中的许穆夫人像

先说卫国。卫国是周室同姓诸侯国，西周初年康叔始封于卫地。《左传》遍收春秋王室贵族秘辛，配合影影绰绰、经常话里有话的《诗经》来读最熨帖痛快，但各国的材料在书中太分散。解决办法是直接看《左传纪事本末》，三百来年中各国之事都按先后顺序集中到一块了，专找某国史事的话再方便不过。
卫之风诗和卫国纪事本末就应该这样焦不离孟、孟不离焦。
我们会从《左传》中读到，卫懿公因为爱鹤而致亡国丧身，这是《载驰》的前传。
卫懿公得位本自不正，这要追溯到他祖父卫宣公和父亲卫惠公。卫宣公好色，夺了本该是儿媳的宣姜做自己的夫人。这位卫宣姜，本姓姜，是齐僖公之女、齐桓公之妹，以美貌闻名。她原本是许配给公子伋的，结果被卫宣公觊觎夺了去。据说《卫风·新台》就是为了讽刺卫宣公这桩强夺儿媳的丑行而作，嘲笑说人家设了鱼网本来是要打鱼的，没想到却网上来他这个癞蛤蟆和丑类。
宣姜嫁给宣公后，先后生了两个儿子，公子寿和公子朔。宣姜派人去刺杀宣公与前妻所生的公子伋，但没想到公子寿非常善良，代伋而死。伋不愿独活，主动暴露自己的身份给刺客，也被杀死。这样，公子朔成了太子，也就是后来的卫惠公。
卫惠公即位时还是个少年，齐国可能担心他祚命不永，强迫惠公的庶兄公子顽跟其母宣姜私通，先后又生下了齐子、戴公申、文公燬、许穆夫人、宋桓夫人。这些都在《左传·闵公二年》中有追叙。虽然事件各方看起来都不大道德，但这有可能是上古收继婚制的遗留，以后不论宣姜的哪个儿子继位，都可以保证齐国延续自己对卫的影响力。
卫惠公在位时，卫国朝政就不太平，他曾一度被迫下野又再登位。惠公死后继位的就是他的儿子卫懿公赤。这位懿公任情由性，对自己的喜好不加节制，《左传》说“懿公好鹤，鹤有乘轩者”。轩是带有…]]></summary>

I have been looking around for GPUs and I have noticed that Radeon Instinct mining GPUs/accelerators are dirt cheap right now. While it wouldn't do as a main GPU in my case I think it would work perfectly as a accelerator for a virtual machine. My question is - are they capable of displaying output in a virtual machine? Second, is it gonna work with MacOs and Windows in KVM? Thanks for any help

memory on server-class systems, but it would now appear that this mechanism
is finding a new use in consumer-electronics devices as well.  The
designated movable block patch set was first submitted
by Doug Berger in September 2022.  By adding more flexibility around the
configuration and use of movable memory, this work will, it is hoped, improve how

	Instead, PyPI maintainers can configure PyPI to trust an identity

ICANN 和 Verisign 在 .NET 注册协议续期提议中悄悄对全球域名政策做出了重大改变，允许任何政府取消、重定向和扣押域名。这项提议目前只针对 .NET 域名，但随着其它顶级域名如 .COM 的注册协议到期，该政策预计也将适用于这些域名。这项提议引发了广泛争议，这意味着对注册者没有任何正当程序的保护。目前该提议正在征询公众意见，计划截至日期为 2023 年 5 月 25 日。

Reddit 将对利用其数据训练 AI 收费

Reddit 是 BBS 论坛风格的社交新闻和聚合讨论网站，包含了大量主题事无巨细的文字讨论。截至 2023 年 2 月其访问量排在全球第十位。ChatGPT 和 Bard 都将 Reddit 作为其训练语料的来源。Reddit CEO Steve Huffman 称该平台的语料库非常有价值，修改了 API 访问政策。它的 API 对开发机器人程序等工具的独立开发者，以及学术和非盈利项目的研究员仍然是免费的，但对通过 API 使用其语料库训练 AI 将要开始收费。


消息来源：Reddit



老王点评：似乎也不是没有道理，这些 AI 基于大量的公共数据进行训练，转而赚的盆满钵满。




微软拒绝为 API 付费，其广告平台停止支持 Twitter

Twitter 废除了免费 API 访问，从 4 月 29 日起启用新的付费 API，其中企业级方案起步价高达每月 4.2 万美元。微软拒绝为访问 API 支付高昂的费用，微软称，“从 2023 年 4 月 25 日开始，多平台的智能广告系列将不再支持 Twitter。”微软的广告功能以前允许广告商在一个地方管理他们在各种平台上的社交媒体账户，用户可以对 Twitter、Facebook 等平台上收到的信息作出回应。去年，微软从通过其广告平台创建、管理和运行的广告中获得了超过 120 亿美元的数字广告收入。顺便说一句，马斯克接管 Twitter 公司后，Twitter 失去了一半的最大广告客户。


消息来源：Mashable



老王点评：这些使用 API 的公司、组织和应用程序都为 Twitter 创造了价值，他们都带动了更多的眼球和流量，鼓励更多的人使用 Twitter，然而 Twitter 却要将它们一脚踢开。]]></summary>

“《卖火柴的女儿》是我有一次出国旅行，路上在格拉司丁堡停留了几天的时候写的”，回忆起那次兴之所至的创作经历，安徒生说道，“当时我接到福林克君一封信，要我照着他信内附来的三张画片之一，替他的历书里作一篇故事。我所挑的一张是一个女孩子拿着许多火柴的画片”（安徒生著、张友松译《安徒生童话的来源和系统——他自己的记载》，载《小说月报》第16卷第9号，1925年）。他绝不会料想到，这篇在行色匆遽中灵光乍现、挥笔立就，与一般童话判然有别的小故事，时隔约半个世纪之后，居然会在遥远的中国大受推崇，相继出现过数十种译本，并被选入各类教材和读本，由此还衍生出不少形式各异的文艺作品，吸引大批学者从不同角度探寻其魅力之所在；而与此同时，受到中西文化差异、社会环境迁变、意识形态递嬗等诸多因素的交互影响，其创作主旨又无端招致诸多或有意或无意的漠视、误读乃至斥责、批判。
一、首译的问世与风行
早年以文言翻译过《皇帝之新衣》（收入《域外小说集》，群益书社，1921年）的周作人，曾经慨叹这类作品“也还值得译成白话，教他尤其通行。可惜我没有这一大段工夫”（《域外小说集序》）。不过他还是抽出时间改用白话翻译了一篇《卖火柴的女儿》（载《新青年》第6卷第12号，1919年），并在当年风靡一时。西谛（郑振铎）在《安徒生的作品及关于安徒生的参考书籍》（载《小说月报》第16卷第8号，1925年）中对此给予过非常高的评价，认为先前由于时机尚未成熟，安徒生的作品并没有引起中国读者的充分重视，“到了‘五四’之后，我们的思想，经了大变化，《新青年》成了青年的指导者，于是周先生译登在《新青年》上的安徒生的《卖火柴的女儿》才为大家所十分注意”，随后以此为契机，“安徒生便为我们所认识，所注意，安徒生的作品也陆续的有人译了”。从中不难窥知周译《卖火柴的女儿》在安徒生童话汉译史上的特殊地位和深远影响。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Fedora Linux 的最新版本 Fedora 38 已经发布，带来了一系列令人兴奋的新功能和更新。以下是其中的一些亮点。


Fedora Linux 是一个流行的发行版，提供最新的软件包和技术。它是一个由红帽公司赞助的社区驱动的项目，是在主流 Linux 发行版之前领先采用新技术和功能的先驱。

它的 2023 年的第一个版本现在已经可以下载和升级。虽然我在我的文章中介绍过了它的功能亮点，但让我给你再摘要介绍一下。



Fedora 38 工作站的新内容

让我们从 Fedora 38 工作站版开始，它默认提供的是 GNOME 桌面。Fedora 38 工作站采用 GNOME 44 版本的桌面环境，为用户提供了正宗的 GNOME 体验，因为 Fedora Linux 工作站搭载的是原汁原味的 GNOME。

在 GNOME 44 中最重要的更新之一是系统托盘菜单中的后台应用程序功能。这个功能在主应用程序窗口不可见时非常有用，许多应用程序和用户都借助了该功能。Fedora 38 还包括了 “文件Files”（即 Nautilus）应用程序中的扩展文件夹视图，现在它可以在列表视图中使用。



此外，Fedora 38 还改进了文件打开对话框，可以在网格视图布局中显示图像预览，这个功能人们已经等待了十年之久。这些变化和改进之外，GNOME 44 中还有许多其他较小的改进。

除了 GNOME，Fedora 38 还有作为 “定制版Spin” 的其他桌面环境，比如 KDE Plasma、Xfce、LXQt 和 MATE。

KDE Plasma 版的 Fedora 38 采用了 Plasma 5.27 桌面版本，其中包括平铺窗口功能、多显示器显示的强大设置、Wayland 更新以及一个全新的欢迎屏幕。

Fedora 38 Xfce 版中包含了 …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ubuntu has the following two properties:
  
You can reasonably expect releases in April and October of every year, and LTS releases in April of every even year.
 Version numbers are based on the release date. Examples: Ubuntu 18.04 was released in April 2018, Ubuntu 22.10 in October 2022.
  
In my experience, if you have an installation that you can't spend much time maintaining but still have to keep reasonably up-to-date, these properties make reasoning and planning easier.
 For some other systems, some of the properties don't hold. Examples: you don't know when Debian bookworm will become the current stable, and nobody knows; you can't infer from the calendar date how old Fedora 37 is or whether 38 has been released yet, you have to look it up.
 Please share your experience.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If desktop linux distros ever succeed and becomes the most used OS (collectively) the pc hardware market would revolve arround them. Manufacturers would prepackage systems with popular, newbie-friendly distros like Ubiuntu, Mint or PoP!_OS.
 However there would be nothing stopping an entity with enough money to create a distribution and make a deal with some manufacturers to ship it preinstalled on new computers.
 This may seem mostly harmless, but the problems are that this entity probably doesn't care that much about FOSS, and if one is succesful, others will follow.
 The software market would also revolve arround linux distros, and I can see companies wanting to implement different types of propietary technologies, like drm and use these company driven distros to spread its adoption.
 These distro companies would probably implement them in order to keep services working and gain marketshare ("Netflix/Prime Video/<game with anti-tamper> exclusive to <tech name> enabled systems, get a Loonez or Tritia computer at your nearest shop") and the technology would become an standard wich without you cant use some things.
 Eventually every one of the distros that don't implement these binaries/blobs would fall behind to where we are now, and desktop linux would follow the steps of Android and AOSP.
 How likely is this to happen? Is it even legally possible?
 Edit: let's also consider manifacturer-made distros.

I really don’t want to use a web-based editor or verifier as I have had some trouble with those in the past.
 I used to use Atom and loved it, but since it is no longer around, I can’t install packages for XML through it.
 Oxygen is just too damn expensive, can’t do it.
 I’ll use Visual Studio Code if there is no other all-in-one option, but I’d really rather not (cuz Microsoft).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Why do application developers allow the use of name and trademarks of their software in linux distros like debian/ubuntu when the repackaged apps often are out of date or have incomplete features? The packages are made by 3rd parties not affiliated with the project so they are basically reusing someone else's branding. A good example I have run into is the nextcloud snap. It's missing components that upstream ships, and can't be migrated to upstream nextcloud without diy. Why would nextcloud allow (mis?)use of their branding like this? Debian seems to enforce this by not allowing application developers to create official packages without going through a debian developer.
 Pretty sure Ubuntu wouldn't be very happy would send me a nasty letter if I did the same thing to their code and just say I am also shipping an OS called ubuntu, so why are they fine doing that to other people software and trademark? Is it because people just don't really care about trademarks and naming right?

We’re Retool (https://retool.com), a visual programming environment for building internal tools. Here’s a 3 minute demo video: https://d3399nw8s4ngfo.cloudfront.net/videos/intro-to-retool....
You can think of Retool as something like Visual Basic, but in the cloud. The idea is that there are lots of internal applications that businesses need, and today, build from scratch (probably via React). But while React is great for many things (our landing page is built in React, our product is built in React, etc.), it’s possible that it might be overkill for building a simple form that POSTs data back to your API. (Who _wants_ to worry about debouncing the submit button, handling errors from the backend, and authenticating and authorizing the users?)
We launched on HN around five years ago …]]></summary>

 Also, ytb-downloader is a crate I made for Vivace that finds available formats for videos and downloads them to a file.
 They're not tested thoroughly yet, but I hope that someone likes them and finds use in either of them :) 
 Any constructive feedback is appreciated, as well as contributions!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[4月20日消息，特斯拉CEO埃隆•马斯克（Elon Musk）旗下太空探索技术公司SpaceX刚刚点火发射了新一代运载火箭星舰（Starship），这也是它的首次轨道飞行测试，但没能成功。21点35分，星舰在得克萨斯州布朗斯维尔（Brownsville）郊外的SpaceX试验场发射升空，随后在空中发生爆炸。SpaceX表示，星舰和推进器未能分离。


4月17日晚间，星舰在原定发射时间将到来时宣布推迟，理由是压力阀似乎冻结。当时，马斯克还发文称“学到很多，几天后再来。”


这次发射任务至关重要，它不但关系到马斯克的火星梦，还会影响美国的重返月球计划。按计划，在星舰发射约8分钟后，其助推器将坠入墨西哥湾。而飞船仓将继续飞行，直至达到约150英里（约240公里）的高度，绕地球飞行一段时间后，重新进入大气层。


如果一切顺利，在发射约90分钟后，飞船仓将重返大气层，坠入考艾岛（Kauai）以北约62英里（约100公里）处的太平洋。虽然助推器和飞船仓都可以回收重复利用，但这一次SpaceX不会进行回收。


重返大气层将考验飞船的空气动力学操纵的能力，以及隔热能力，以承受它在垂直穿过大气层时产生的强烈摩擦。马斯克说：“飞船将像流星一样驶来。这也是它未来多次飞行的漫长旅程的第一步。更多的助推器已经在发射场待命，用于未来的试飞。”


星舰是SpaceX的新一代运载火箭，总高度约120米，由底部70米高、配备33台猛禽发动机的超重型推进器，以及顶部50米高、可重复利用的飞船舱组成。其终极目标是搭载宇航员前往月球和火星。


SpaceX自2019年以来就在开发星舰，并对多艘原型进行了测试，而这一次是它的首次轨道飞行测试，旨在为SpaceX提供大量有价值的信息，以尽早让星舰正式投入运营。


根据SpaceX的设想，“星舰”是一种完全可重复使用的运输系统，可以将航天员和货物运送到地球轨道、月球、火星等地。美国“太空”网站称，此前保持“人类最大运载火箭”称号的是冷战期间用于“阿波罗”登月计划的美国“土星五号”火箭，它高约111米，可发射约130吨有效载荷进入地球轨道，将约50吨有效载荷送往月球。NASA表示，“太空发射系统”可将27吨以上的载荷送入月球轨道。相比之下，完全可重复使用“星舰”的近地轨道运载能力约为150吨。在不考虑回收的情况下，“星舰”有效载荷高达250吨-300吨。


SpaceX公司CEO马斯克曾表示，与专门用于载人登月的“土星五号”和“太空发射系统”不同，“星舰”凭借强大的运载能力和多用化设计，可执行“星链”卫星发射、向月球和火星运送航天员和设备，以及更富科幻色彩的外星殖民和太空矿业开发。


马斯克还宣称，“星舰”的发射成本相当低，一旦相关试验取得成功，将启动规模化生产，以每年建造100艘的速度，打造1000艘“星舰”组成的太空舰队，将10万人和相关物资运送到火星，实现从21世纪20年代后期开始在火星殖民的梦想。


如果星舰试射成功，外界认为，这将是一个重要里程碑，标志着马斯克的人类移民火星计划迈出关键一步。

Docker 公司 CEO 表示，该公司的年度经常性收入在过去 3 年中增长了 30 倍。他将收入的增长归功于“与 7 万多个商业客户之间的信任”，尽管另一个因素是连续的提价和减少免费和低成本的 Docker 计划的范围。这些条款的突然和重大改变，有时让用户感到被胁迫，一些人已经寻找其他选择，但仍然有超过 1300 万的开发者使用免费计划。Docker 称，其发展是由现有用户的遥测数据指导的，他们“以匿名的方式，每秒钟收集了超过 23000 个事件”。

苹果公司选择旁观 ChatGPT

微软向开发 ChatGPT 的 OpenAI 投资百亿美元，Google 进入了恐慌模式将应对 ChatGPT 的挑战作为其最优先事项，亚马逊 AWS 也开始提供各种基于云端的大语言模型。然而世界上市值最高的企业至今未对此有任何表态。苹果主要卖的是硬件，ChatGPT 之类的 AI 对其产品而言是锦上添花，但加入 AI 竞赛需要大量投资，其中云计算是关键，而云计算并不是苹果擅长的领域。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi,
 I recently returned to Linux and am having a nice time but I have missed a lot of changes, largely around containers. I started using Linux with Slackware in 1995 although I had programmed on UNIX systems since the 1980s but in some ways I am now a bit of a noob, in others an old dog. The problem I have is flatpacks/snaps. I am in no way saying that they don't have use-cases but I cannot bring myself to trust them.
 I am finding myself seeking out packages and installing them rather than containers. I tried chrome and some other apps with flatpacks (laptop) and snaps (desktop) some issues with integration and some settings not working so I went back to debs (I haven't used any non-Debian distros so far as things are working so well). 
 Am I getting it all wrong? Have I missed the point? Am I alone in not really trusting that I know what I am getting with the containers? Am I too old and dim to see the errors of my ways? Is there a benefit that I am missing?
 If I've had any versioning problems in the past then I have fixed them. My biggest Linux problems in the past have came from Kernel upgrades so I try to stick to stable distributions and I intend to do that now although the shiny does appeal. I don't see containers giving me any benefits for desktop apps although I understand they make it easier for the maintainers. Some apps have been difficult to find current builds that aren't in containers. At the moment I'd sooner unzip and install manually than take a package.
 Thanks,
 Gormanghast

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[4月20日早间消息，据报道，微软发表声明称，面向广告主的社交媒体规划和调度工具不再支持Twitter，因为马斯克改变政策，以后接入Twitter程序界面要收费。


马斯克对微软的封杀令十分不满，他指责微软非法使用Twitter数据进行AI训练，还威胁要起诉微软。在马斯克的领导下，企业如果想访问Twitter数据流需要付费，微软的不满完全可以理解。


今天凌晨，马斯克在推特表示， “他们（微软）非法利用推特的数据来训练。是时候起诉他们了。”


不过，虽然ChatGPT与微软的其他AI在训练时使用了大量的互联网数据并非秘密，但马斯克却并没有什么证据来支持他的指控。


而事实上，马斯克提出起诉微软也并非是因为介意对方使用了推特的数据， 而仅仅是对微软停止合作支持的威胁，以及对OpenAI不满的迁怒。


微软开发的Smart Campaigns服务可以帮助广告主管理社交媒体营销活动，覆盖Facebook、Instagram和LinkedIn等平台。微软表示，从4月25日起Smart Campaigns用户将无法执行创作推文、撰写草稿等任务，也无法看到过去的推文，无法查看推文互动情况。


微软是OpenAI的最大投资者，马斯克曾参与组建OpenAI，2018年离开。目前马斯克领导的Twitter也在向AI下注。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[在 FreeDOS 上使用 C 语言编程与在 Linux 上使用 C 语言编程非常类似。


当我第一次开始使用 DOS 时，我喜欢 DOS 自带的 BASIC 来编写游戏和其它一些有趣的程序。很长时间后，我才学习 C 编程语言。

我马上爱上了使用 C 语言做开发！它是一种简单易懂的编程语言，在编写有用的程序时，这给予我很大的灵活性。实际上，很多 FreeDOS 的核心实用程序都是使用 C 语言和汇编语言编写的。

因此，FreeDOS 的 1.3 RC4 包含一个 C 语言可能并不出人意料，此外还有其它编程语言的编译器。FreeDOS 的 1.3 RC4 LiveCD 包含两个 C 编译器：Bruce's C 编译器（一个简单的 C 编译器）和 OpenWatcom C 编译器 。在 Bonus CD 上，你也可以找到 DJGPP（一款基于 GNU 的 GCC 的 32 位 C 编译器）和 GCC 的 IA-16 移植（需要 386 或更好的 CPU 来编译，但是，生成的程序可以在低端系统上运行）。

在 FreeDOS 上使用 C 语言编程与在 Linux 上使用 C 语言编程非常类似，但是有两个例外：


你需要知道你使用了多少内存。 Linux 允许程序使用很多内存，但是 FreeDOS 有很多限制。DOS 程序只使用四种 内存模式（大、中、紧凑和小）中的其中一种，具体取决于它们需要多少内存。

你可以直接访问控制台终端。 在 Linux 上，你可以创建 文本模式 的程序，使用一个诸如 ncurses 之类的库来绘制终端屏幕。但是，DOS 允许程序访问控制台终端和视频硬件。这为编写更有趣的程序提供了极大的灵活性。


我喜欢在 GCC 的 IA-16 移植或 OpenWatcom 中编写我的 C 程序，具体取决于我正在编写的是哪种程序。Open…]]></summary>

The one large advantage I could think of is the fact that maybe some paid proprietary programs like the Adobe Suit as an example might feel more comfortable releasing their programs through these types of channels, BECAUSE there is only 1 source available, but in practice this basically doesn't happen anyway, so what is the point. Snaps in comparison to flatpaks do also support system components that aren't user applications, so in some rare cases, this might actually a good way to install them of there is any reason you don't want them from your official system repos.
 But back to the main point, for the most part I hear people say they either don't care about installing snaps or not (neutral stance) or they are negative about snaps in general. Outside of the large group op people that just use Ubuntu and regular users, specifically talking about 'Linux geeks', who is actually positive about snaps packages and are there advantages am I missing here?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[“花如遗恨不重开”：以意逆志的难题
顷阅吕本中《东莱诗集》，有《暮步至江上》一首，云：“客事久输鹦鹉杯，春愁如接凤凰台。树阴不碍帆影过，雨气却随潮信来。山似故人堪对饮，花如遗恨不重开。雪篱风榭年年事，辜负风光取次回。”对其中“花如遗恨不重开”一句，颇有疑问。盖花开落有时，只要气候正常、花未枯死，岂有“不重开”的道理？戏文小说中也常说“花有重开日，人无再少年”，则似乎诗句有悖常理。又想到或许诗句是作者即景之作，见此处花当开未开，故云。但似乎除非他曾经同样的时节到过同样的地方，且当时花开烂漫，否则言“花不开”则可，言“花不重开”，“重”字总有些没有着落。久思未得，只能求助于注本，所幸近年来出版了两种吕本中诗集的注本：上海古籍出版社出版祝尚书先生笺注的《吕本中诗集笺注》与中华书局出版韩酉山先生校注的《吕本中诗集校注》。但翻阅二书，依旧找不到理想的答案：祝注详于典故与时事的注解，于此句一无发挥，韩注多有串讲，倒有一番解释：“意谓花在寂寞中自开自谢，如今仿佛带着遗恨不再重开。”但也没指出因何作者要说“不再重开”。

注本中没有找到理想的答案，只能再反求诸己。一再思考，终于恍然大悟：我们似乎都为前句“山似故人”一句所障敝，想当然地认为“如”字是“像”“似”之意，但其实它也可以有假设的意味，释为“如果”，如此疑虑似可涣然冰释：我们的传统认为，花草树木、天地自然一类，皆为无情无思之物，故或能长生，或荣悴有节，谢而能重开，死而能复生。这自诗经《隰有苌楚》“夭之沃沃，乐子之无知”开始就是如此（钱锺书先生《管锥编·毛诗正义·隰有苌楚》条即有论）。孟浩然诗“草木本无意，荣枯自有时”即此意。吕居仁此处则是反用其意，说花如果有遗恨（即带着感情），则不能重开了；“花不重开”之违反一般规律，正是有“遗恨”这一假设前提在。这正与李贺之“天若有情天亦老”以及宋初石曼卿给他对的下联“月如无恨月长圆”是一个道理：…]]></summary>

大卫·格雷伯（David Graeber，1961-2020）的《规则的悖论：想象背后的技术、愚笨与权力诱惑》（原书名：The Utopia of Rules: On Technology, Stupidity, and the Secret Joys of Bureaucracy，2015）是一部来自街头与思想前沿的政治人类学著作，在作者去世后世界发生的许多事情更是充分说明了该书所具有的重要意义。比起之前我们读过的格雷伯《无政府主义人类学碎片》和《毫无意义的工作》，这本《规则的悖论》有更明确的问题指向和更尖锐的思想交锋，在关于当下全球性、全方位官僚制的研究中是很有冲击力的思想文本。另外我同时感受到的阅读乐趣是，如同格雷伯的其他著作一样，在本书的探讨背后的学术视角和学科资源来自人类学、政治经济学、历史学、文学、神学甚至流行文化中的漫画和超级英雄剧等领域，充分展示了开阔的学术视野和在现实生活中透露的政治关怀。
该书名直译是“规则的乌托邦：论技术、愚蠢和官僚制的秘密乐趣”。我注意到在全书正文第一句就出现“官僚制”，译者加了注释：“官僚制又译科层制，本书中统一作官僚制”。在中文使用语境中的“官僚”与“科层”有不同的褒贬倾向，在该书中统一译作“官僚制”当然更符合格雷伯的理论与情感色彩。
大卫·格雷伯不仅是著名的人类学家。格雷伯出身于自学成才的工人阶级知识分子家庭，父亲曾参加过西班牙内战，他从小在被描述为“充满激进政治”的公寓楼里长大。1996年他在芝加哥大学获得人类学博士学位后在马达加斯加进行人类学田野考察，在这本《规则的悖论》中也可以看到他援引了许多人类学考察的实例。在2011年的“占领华尔街”运动中，他是主要策划者和组织者之一，人们相信是他提出了“我们…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[PatternFly 是一个开源、开放社区的设计系统。


你是否曾欣赏过宝石的切面？这些角度和倾斜是一件美丽的事情。你可以看到多面宝石比平面宝石更亮。在分析一个多面体设计系统时，你也可能会看到这种美。设计系统是用于创建一致且统一的用户界面（UI）的准则、标准和资源的集合。就像钻石的各个切面一样，一个富含不同贡献和社区参与的开源设计系统最终会带来更好的产品体验。

PatternFly 项目是一个用于红帽产品的开源设计系统。但开源并没有以 PatternFly 的代码为终点。PatternFly 的背后是一群完全公开创作设计的人。从设计师和开发人员到研究人员和作家，我们作为一个开源社区共同努力。

我们的秘密？我们没有秘密 —— 我们在开放中工作，记得吗？然而，我们使用了这五个最佳实践。我将在这里分享它们，这样你也可以使用开源来支持你自己的设计系统。

1、集体贡献

我们有一个核心的 PatternFly 设计团队来设计、维护和发展设计系统。但我们鼓励并欢迎所有人的贡献。如果你对协作充满热情并且擅长用户体验（UX），PatternFly 希望收到你的反馈。

2、建立社区

在孤岛中创建的任何内容都无法进入 PatternFly。我们相信开放的设计更好。这就是我们将社区纳入所有更新、更改和添加的原因。我们收集来自设计和开发人员对贡献的反馈，以便每个人都对实施的内容有发言权。我们还寻求多个 设计学科 的人们的意见和协作。这样做是为了摆脱任何偏见或假设。这种开放的设计让我们的设计体系更加强大。它还加强了我们蓬勃发展的社区，该社区由参与 PatternFly 或为之做出贡献的人们组成（我们亲切地称他们为 “飞人”）。

3、在每个人中循环

如果你发现与他人集思广益的想法产生的解决方案比任何一个人梦寐以求的都要好，那么你已经像“飞人”一样思考了。我们定期举行设计会议，供贡献者在小组环境中展示他们的想法并讨论设计方法。这使我们能够保持我们的想法协作，并从各个角度考虑设计。此外，我们每月举办社区会议，以便我们可以与来自全球各地的“飞人”们联系并分享最新动态。你可以在我们的 PatternFly YouTube 频道 上观看我们过去的所有会议记录。

4、倾听用户

作为一个社区，我们的目标是让 PatternFly 的所有贡献都能在不同的环境中带来功能性和美观的产品体验。为了实现这一目标，我们要求自己打破自己的泡沫并与用户互动。我们与 UX 研究人员合作，与用户一起测试更新、更改和添加（例如视觉主题和交互），以确保我们创建的设计、资源和体验能够为每个人解决问题，而不仅仅是像我们这样的人。

5、创建连接

PatternFly 是贯穿红帽公司产品的一致性的主线。每个人都有创造的自由，来构建最适合他们用户的东西。但我们作为一个团队，通过设计系统连接产品组，以获得更统一的用户体验。PatternFly 的资源很容易获得，并向所有人开放。这有助于我们建立联系，压制孤岛。

与我们一起开放设计

无论你是一个由 1 人还是 100 人组成的团队，或者你的设计系统是否是开源的，在我们所做的每一件事中，总有一点协作和社区的空间。联系 PatternFly 社区，告诉我们你的结果如何。我们迫不及待地想收到你的来信。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I just found out that Brother's drivers include an optional daemon that listens for the "scan" button on their scanners. It runs a script that's supplied by Brother when the scan button is pressed. So of couse it's editable. In my opinion this is first class support for Linux so I'm posting here to commend them. I'll be buying Brother products.

immutable operating system designed for developers and advanced users, has 
been using Ubuntu as its base. However, a
recent announcement
has revealed that, in the upcoming Vanilla OS 2.0 Orchid release, the
project will be shifting to Debian unstable (Sid) as
its new base 
operating system. Vanilla OS is making the switch due to Ubuntu's changes to
its version of the GNOME desktop environment along with the distribution's
reliance on the Snap packaging format.
The decision has generated a fair amount of interest and
discussion within the open-source community.]]></summary>

has been through a difficult period; this post describes
the extensive changes that have been made in response.

	The current Solus tooling, as well as the resulting packaging and

上个月一架澳大利亚军方的 MRH-90 直升机在例行的海上演习中失去动力坠落。MRH-90 是老旧的欧制直升机，即将退役。事故原因被认为是直升机未能打上重要软件补丁，该补丁将防止飞行员对发动机关闭再重新启动，而它的设计不允许这么做，它要求在飞行结束时引擎空转直至关闭。防止热启动的软件补丁早就存在许多年，但很多 MRH-90 并没有打上补丁。

老王点评：瞧瞧，不打补丁的结果多可怕。




英特尔停止生产 ASIC 挖矿芯片

自从英特尔正式宣布其挖矿芯片 Blockscale ASIC 以来，仅仅过了一年，该公司就宣布其第一代 Blockscale 1000 系列芯片的寿命结束，而且没有宣布该芯片的任何后续世代。英特尔称，“公司更加关注 IDM 2.0 业务是终止 Blockscale ASIC 的原因”。但英特尔表示“会继续监测市场机会”。

老王点评：投机失败，现在芯片厂商最好的生意是生产 AI 芯片。




马斯克正在开发“最大限度地寻求真相的 AI”

在成立了 X.AI 公司之后，埃隆·马斯克说他正在开发一个 ChatGPT 的替代品，“最大限度地寻求真相的 AI”，它被称之为 TruthGPT。他称该人工智能试图理解宇宙的本质，他“认为这可能是通往安全的最佳途径，因为关心了解宇宙的人工智能不太可能消灭人类，因为我们是宇宙中有趣的一部分。”OpenAI 是他帮助创立的人工智能软件非营利组织，此后 OpenAI 开始运营一个营利性子公司。他暗示，OpenAI 的利润激励可能会干扰其创建的人工智能模型的道德。


消息来源：The Verge



老王点评：听起来脑洞大开，但是我估计马斯克最后悔的还是离开 OpenAI。]]></summary>

你是否正在寻找可以重复使用的公开许可的内容？那么你可能会对 Openverse 感兴趣。Openverse 是一个创新工具，可从不同数据库的集合中对多达 3 亿张图片进行搜索。它不仅仅可以搜索图像，还允许用户访问由机器学习模型创建的标签，并可以一键设置归属。由于可以搜索大量的视觉效果，用户可以找到完美的图像，使他们的项目更具吸引力。这些内容来自各种来源，包括史密森尼博物馆、克利夫兰艺术博物馆、美国宇航局和纽约公共图书馆。

2019 年，知识共享Creative Commons（CC）站点提供的 CC Search 工具被 WordPress 项目采用。Openverse 是 CC Search 的新化身。

目前，Openverse 仅索引了图像和视听内容。视频的搜索可以从外部来源获得。他们计划增加更多的开放性文本、3D 模型等形式。他们有一个共同的目标：让人们可以使用 知识共享 许可和在线公共领域作品，这些估计有 25 亿之多。他们所使用的代码都是开源的。

请注意，Openverse 不保证视觉资料已正确提供了知识共享许可，也不保证所收集的归属信息和任何其他相关许可信息准确完整。为了安全起见，请在重新使用材料之前仔细检查版权状态和归属信息。要了解更多信息，请阅读 Openverse 中的使用条款。

Openverse 搜索

使用 Openverse 很容易。在搜索内容字段中输入你的搜索词，然后按回车。我对“尼亚加拉大瀑布”进行了简单搜索，收到了超过 10,000 个结果 的图像和两个音频结果。在显示屏的最右侧是一个对话框，用于检查可用于商业用途的内容，另一个用于检查允许修改和改编的内容。

此外，第二个复选框允许你指定要使用或重复使用的知识共享许可，包括 CC0（公共领域）、CC-BY、CC-BY-SA、所有 CC-BY-NC-ND 的方式。

有功者受禄

在使用公开许可的内容时，重要的是确保你提供适当的归属，并遵守内容原创作者所规定的许可条款。关于知识共享协议的更多信息，请查阅 知识共享网站。

Openverse 是一个 开源 项目，这意味着你可以托管自己的副本或为该项目做出贡献。该项目有一个 贡献者指南，供想要参与的人使用。该项目还欢迎你对新特性和功能提出 建议。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[For recreational e-books, anything does, but for e-books where I wish to annotate the text with highlights or notes, I strongly prefer the PDF format as it's the most convenient. You can directly bake in annotations into the file and move it around.
 But for those cases where the PDF is unavailable (and I don't wish to use the converted version), I require an app which allows me to sync annotations I make while reading an epub/mobi file with an online copy of the file (since baking in annotations into the files themselves isn't possible with readers).
 Currently, the only two options for this, AFAIK, are Kindle and FBReader.
  
Kindle : No Linux app.
 FBReader : 
 UI/UX is all over the place. Absolutely no rhyme or reason.
 The reader on the Linux app is substandard as it often fails to display formatting elements. Even the one in the Android app is not much better.
 
  
Is there any Linux friendly alternative to these two? Thanks.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[社交平台Reddit不想再让科技巨头们免费使用海量数据了。当地时间4月18日，据《纽约时报》，Reddit近日表示，计划开始向访问其应用程序编程接口（API） 的公司收费，外部企业可以通过付费下载和处理社交网络中的海量对话。


公开资料显示，Reddit被称为“美国版百度贴吧”，是一家拥有18年历史的社交媒体平台，用户可以在上面发帖、评论、交流各种话题。


近年来，Reddit上发布的聊天内容已成为谷歌、OpenAI和微软等公司的训练素材，这些公司正在搜集和使用Reddit平台上的对话来开发ChatGPT等生成式人工智能产品。


“Reddit的数据语料库非常有价值，”Reddit创始人兼CEO史蒂夫·霍夫曼在接受《纽约时报》采访时表示，“但我们不想把这些内容免费提供给一些巨头公司。”


Reddit也成为首批公开表态要求科技巨头付费使用数据的企业。


“这些人工智能公司使用Reddit数据创造价值，却不将任何价值返回给Reddit用户，这是不合理的。”霍夫曼认为，在他看来，为此向这些科技巨头收费是一个公平的举措。


据《纽约时报》，谷歌、Open AI和微软尚未回应此事。谷歌开发的聊天机器人Bard的底层算法部分是在Reddit数据上训练的，OpenAI的ChatGPT也引用Reddit数据作为接受培训的信息来源之一。


Reddit尚未公开具体的收费规则和种类，外界预期将根据数据大小实行分类价格。


霍夫曼表示，Reddit的API将继续免费提供给希望构建应用程序，帮助人们使用Reddit的开发人员，出于非商业目的研究Reddit数据的研究人员也可以继续免费访问。


未来，Reddit希望将更多机器学习纳入网站应用中，例如用来识别Reddit上人工智能生成文本的使用，并添加标签来通知用户该评论来自机器人。同时，还将支持论坛管理员使用帮助监控用户发帖内容的第三方机器人，方便管理。


Reddit此举或许与其今年计划IPO（首次公开募股）有关。


Reddit成立于2005年，主要收入来源于平台上的广告和电子商务交易。Reddit表示，它仍在敲定API访问收费的细节，并将在未来几周内公布价格。


值得注意的是，除了Reddit之外，其他公司也逐渐不再愿意免费提供平台数据。当地时间4月19日，美国消费者新闻与商业频道（CNBC）报道，社交媒体推特CEO埃隆•马斯克威胁要起诉微软。马斯克指责微软非法使用其社交媒体推特上的数据，以训练其人工智能模型。


此前有媒体报道，微软的广告平台将停止支持推特，因为推特更改了其API的定价。马斯克在这条推文下留言，“他们非法使用推特数据进行训练。诉讼时间到了。”根据推特的新定价，API用户（包括企业和研究机构）每月至少需要支付高达4.2万美元才可使用。


据CNBC报道，类似于GPT的大型语言模型需要TB级数据库（存储数据量为1TB以上）进行训练，其中大部分数据从社交网站Reddit、程序员问答社区StackOverflow和推特等网站中抓取——来自社交网络的培训数据非常有价值，因为其具有非正式场合的交互对话。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[王仲荦先生（1913-1986）

《中国历史大辞典》（以下简称《大辞典》）自1982年上海的分卷主编会议做出具体出版部署以来，进展不小。尤其是1983年底，第一个分卷《史学史》的问世，给其他分卷以巨大的鼓舞和鞭策。
《大辞典》的《魏晋南北朝史》（以下简称《魏晋卷》）的两位主编是胡守为与杨廷福。胡守为生于1929年，毕业于岭南大学（中山大学的前身）历史系，五十年代受中山大学校方委派，担任史学泰斗陈寅恪的学术助手，八十年代初，接受《大辞典》编纂处之聘，出任《魏晋卷》的主编时，年方五十一岁，职称还是副教授。而杨廷福生于1920年，比胡守为年长九岁。杨廷福曾入学著名的无锡国立专科学校，1945年毕业于复旦大学中文系。1957年“丁酉之灾”时，被划为“右派”，长期为上海教育学院历史系的编外之氓。但他不甘沉沦，反而加倍砥砺向学。粉碎“四人帮”之后，终于颖脱而出，一鸣惊人地发表了一系列唐律与唐代社会文化史的论文，名动海内外，因而被破格提升为正教授。
在胡守为、杨廷福两位主编的主持下，《魏晋卷》于1982年及1983年在上海与黄山召开了两次编委会议，切磋了样稿，交流了运用辞书体例撰稿的体会，于是便有了在青岛召开第三次编委会议的动议。但此时传来了杨廷福患肺癌在沪不幸去世的凶信，这是《魏晋卷》的一大损失，千斤重担将由胡守为统率的编委们承担起来了。
选择青岛作为《魏晋卷》第三次编委会定稿之地是有深意的。青岛濒临黄海，四季气候宜人，更重要的是治本段历史的“亚圣”王仲荦仍在山东大学绛帐授徒。胡守为通过本卷编委、在山大执教的郑佩鑫请王仲老拨冗审读了部分稿子，请他前来发表高见，用胡守为的话来说就是“为我们壮胆”！
王仲荦当时年已七十一岁，“矍铄哉是翁也”，他思维清晰，反应敏捷。当他知道我是上海辞书出版社的编辑，马上说：“罗竹风同志那里来的。”罗竹风建国初是山东大学的军代表，五十年代调任上海出版局局长。…]]></summary>

I’ve been building this over the past few weeks to compare LLMs from different providers like OpenAI, Anthropic, Cohere, etc. At Vercel, I manage our Frameworks division (including Next.js, Svelte, and Turbo) and wanted to also dogfood some of the latest features in a slightly larger application.
This playground takes a lot of inspiration from https://nat.dev and is built on Tailwind, ui.shadcn.com, and some upcoming Vercel products we’re announcing soon. We’re going to continue adding models to compare and add other frameworks to generate code snippets from.

update on the status of the SUSE Adaptable Linux Platform (ALP) project

	The ALP concept should be flexible enough that these openSUSE
	Products will be able to leverage all the stuff SUSE is doing for
	SUSE's ALP Products, but then we (community) can add anything we
	want. If we find it is not flexible enough, then we (SUSE) will
	work to adapt it to make it possible for the community to build
	what it wants.

	So, if we the community want to build something like old Leap, that
	should be totally technically feasible.]]></summary>

 I always used Windows and i started with Windows95 and few years ago I started using Linux because of a mentor/friend who helped me with many issues.
 How the title says, what flaws does Linux have?
 The biggest flaw that is also bothering me are packages themselves, so the illusion that is being sold here is that Linux is something like a universal system.
 Most people would assume that if you have a Linux system it just runs programs, but sadly you can't install Ubuntu packages on Arch Linux for example, I would understand that some things work different but I truly think that instead of making 2 separate packages for various distros we should maintain one package that would run on multiple distros.
 Most of the packages are on Ubuntu so me who likes Arch... can't use it, some of them I can compile and build for Arch but this is wrong advertisement that was made when I moved to Linux. People said that I don't need to jump around pages, click download, and just write 1 command line and done.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[“站在巨人的肩膀上”不仅是指开源，而且是指通过承认女性先驱和领导者在该领域的作用，在技术中建立姐妹情谊的基础。


两年多前，我从艺术家转职成为一名 软件开发人员。我不是单凭一己之力做到的。 我得到了 PyLadies Berlin 的支持，PyLadies Berlin 是一个国际志愿者团体的柏林本地分会，旨在支持女性从事技术工作。

我们习惯了“职业变化”这个词，就好像它是一个轨迹的中断。但根据我的经验，事实并非如此。一个人无法抹去自己过去的点点滴滴，而多样化背景带来的丰富性可以造就爆发点。个体的人生旅程虽然通常与计算机科学毫无相关，却担起了令科技对社会有所影响的职责，并为技术行业带来丰富性和创造力。

作为一名艺术家，我得到了自由，并打开了探索从建筑到科学等多个领域的大门。我大部分的艺术经历发生在巴西的黑客空间里，这里充斥着自由及开源软件Free/Libre Open Source Software（FLOSS）的思想，即开放的自由共享文化。如今，由于一些不属于本文讨论范围的意识形态和实践原因，最常见的术语是“开源”。对我来说幸运的是，我的职业转变始于一次在 开源项目办公室Open Source Program Office（OSPO）的实习，它让我的转变经历感觉——几乎可以说——像回家一样。

放在巨人的肩膀上

我们都受益于开源。无论你是否编码，你所使用的软件都依赖于它。由于这是一种开放的文化，一切都建立在他人的工作之上，所以经常听到“站在巨人的肩膀上”这个表述，指的是我们的进步都建立在前人的工作和贡献之上。 这突出了从他人的经验和成就中学习的重要性。

这篇文章旨在揭示我站在谁的肩膀上。这不仅是为了表达我对他们的感激之情，也是为了回答我在接受 JSParty 的 Kevin Ball 和 Christopher Hiller 采访时被问到的一个问题…]]></summary>

 How bad is it, what doesn't actually work. Is there a certain distro or driver that needs to be used or window manger that i need to use/avoid to avoid crashes, issues.
 Is anyone running a Nvidia ~4090/4080 that can help clear up the confusion so i avoid making an expensive mistake?

out that many Linux systems using encrypted disks were installed with a
relatively weak key derivation function that could make it relatively easy
for a well-resourced attacker to break the encryption:


	So, in these days of attackers with access to a pile of GPUs, a
	purely computationally expensive KDF is just not a good
	choice. And, unfortunately, the subject of this story was almost
	certainly using one of those. Ubuntu 18.04 used the LUKS1 header
	format, and the only KDF supported in this format is PBKDF2. This
	is not a memory expensive KDF, and so is vulnerable to GPU-based
	attacks. But even so, systems using the LUKS2 header format used to
	default to argon2i, again not a memory expensive KDF. New versions
	default to argon2id, which is. You want to be using argon2id.

system to a more secure setup.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[谷歌 CEO 称出于“不作恶”而不发布高级 AI

谷歌 CEO 皮查伊在采访中谈论了他对 AI 的担忧。他称，谷歌创办之初制定的“不作恶”信条仍然在该公司的行为准则内，不发布 AI 聊天机器人 Bard 的高级版本是出于负责任的理念，给社会更多时间适应技术，给公司更多时间开发安全层。皮查伊称，AI 技术必须被监管，确保它如谷歌行为准则描绘的那样“做正确的事”。Bard 内置了安全过滤器，以帮助抵御恶意用户的威胁，谷歌需要持续更新系统的算法，以打击虚假信息，检测深度伪造和逼真的计算机生成图像。


消息来源：CBS News



老王点评：我记得谷歌已经将“不作恶”信条从公司行为准则中删除了？




iOS 17 将支持应用侧载

据报道，苹果将在 iOS 17 中首次加入对应用侧载的支持，允许 iOS 用户安装从官方商店之外下载的应用，比如应用的官网，这意味着应用开发商不需要向苹果支付 15% 到 30% 的“苹果税”。欧盟的数字市场法（DMA）已于 2022 年 11 月 1 日生效，要求苹果等巨头向其他公司和开发商开放其服务和平台。苹果公司声称，侧载将 “破坏 iPhone 用户依赖的隐私和安全保护”，使人们容易受到恶意软件、诈骗、数据跟踪和其他问题的影响。然而，苹果公司必须遵守 DMA 的规定，否则将面临高达其全球收入 20% 的罚款。


消息来源：Mac Rumors



老王点评：苹果不能从销售中收费的话，它还可以对应用进行安全验证，这也是可以收费的。

索尼世界摄影大奖评选的是照片而不是图像，因而，当一副 AI 生成的图像获得了创意类别的一等奖后，提交这幅作品的人放弃了差旅报销、高额奖金和礼品，亲自自费前往颁奖现场宣布了拒绝领奖的决定。这幅获奖作品是他使用 AI 创作的一系列图像之一。他认为这些图像是由人类和 AI 共同创作的，而不是按一个按钮就生成的。这位三十年的摄影师把他的作品称为 “图像” 而不是 “照片”，因为它们是 “合成的，使用 ‘摄影’ 作为视觉语言”。他希望此事能引起摄影行业对 AI 合成图像的公开讨论，应该为此类图像单独设立一个分类。

变更数据捕获Change Data Capture（CDC）使用服务端代理来记录、添加、更新和删除对数据表的各种操作。它以一种易用的关系型格式提供了数据变化的细节信息。它可以捕获将更改应用于目标环境中的已修改行所需的列信息和元数据。这些信息保存在一个与被跟踪的源表的列结构相对应的变化表内。

捕获变更的数据可不是一件容易的事。不过，有一个开源项目 —— Apache SeaTunnel，它是一个数据整合平台，它提供的 CDC 功能的设计理念和功能集使这些捕获成为可能，其功能包括上文提到的，超越了现有产品的解决方案。

使用场景

CDC 的经典应用是异质数据库之间的数据同步或备份。你可以在 MySQL、PostgreSQL、MariaDB 和类似的数据库间进行数据同步。另外一个例子，你也可以将数据同步到应该全文搜索引擎。借助 CDC，你可以基于 CDC 捕获的数据创建备份。

如果设计得当，数据分析系统通过订阅目标数据表的变化情况获取需要处理的数据，而不需要将分析过程嵌入已有系统。

在微服务间共享数据状态

微服务现在很流行，但是在微服务间共享信息往往是一件复杂的事。CDC 是一个可能的解决方案。微服务可以使用 CDC 来获取其他微服务的数据库变化，获取数据状态更新，以及执行相应逻辑。

更新缓存

命令查询责任隔离Command Query Responsibility Segregation（CQRS）的概念是将命令活动与查询活动分开。这两者有本质上的不同：


命令向数据源写入数据。

查询从数据源读取数据。


问题是，读事件发生的时间与写事件发生的时间有关，以及这些事件的发生是由谁来承担责任的?

更新缓存可能很困难。你可以使用 CD…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[4月18日消息，据报道，以色列网络安全公司Team8的最新报告显示，使用ChatGPT等生成式人工智能的企业可能会因此泄露客户信息和商业机密。


该报告称，新型人工智能聊天机器人和协作工具的广泛普及，可能会令一些公司面临数据泄露和法律风险。他们担心黑客可能会利用聊天机器人获取敏感的企业信息或对企业发动攻击。此外，目前投喂给聊天机器人的机密信息未来也有可能会被人工智能公司利用。


包括微软和Alphabet在内的大型科技公司都在争相通过生成式人工智能技术改进聊天机器人和搜索引擎，利用互联网上获取的数据训练他们的模型，从而为用户提供一站式问答服务。报告称，如果使用机密或私密数据来投喂这些工具，今后将很难删除相关信息。


该报告写道：“使用生成式人工智能的企业，其敏感信息、知识产权、源代码、商业机密和其他数据，可能会通过用户直接输入或API等渠道被他人获取和处理，其中包括客户信息或私密信息以及机密信息。”Team8将这一风险标记为“高风险”。他们认为，如果采取适当的防范措施，该风险“可控”。


Team8在报告中强调，聊天机器人的查询并不会被输入大预言模型来训练人工智能，而与之相悖的是，最近的报告声称这样的提示信息有可能会被其他人看到。


“截至发稿，大语言模型还无法实时自我更新，因此无法将一个人输入的信息反馈给另外一个人，从而有效打消这种顾虑。然而，在训练未来版本的大语言模型时，未必不会采取这种方法。”该报告写道。


该报告还标记了另外3项与整合生成式人工智能工具有关的“高风险”问题，并强调了通过第三方应用分享越来越多的信息所产生的威胁。微软就将部分人工智能聊天机器人功能嵌入了必应搜索和Office 365工具。


报告称：“例如，在用户端，第三方应用会利用生成式人工智能API，倘若遭到攻击，就有可能提供电子邮件和网络浏览器权限，攻击者还有可能冒充用户采取行动。”


该公司认为，使用人工智能也有可能加剧歧视问题、损害公司声誉或导致企业遭遇侵权诉讼。这些都属于“中风险”问题。


微软公司副总裁安·约翰逊（Ann Johnson）参与起草了这份报告。微软向ChatGPT的开发商OpenAI投资了数十亿美元。


微软发言人说：“微软鼓励对安全和人工智能领域的网络风险展开透明的讨论。”


OpenAI开发的ChatGPT聊天机器人的火爆引发了监管呼声。各界都担心在企业试图利用这项技术提高效率时，这种创新也有可能会被用于不法行为。


美国联邦贸易委员会（FTC）官员周二表示，该机构将重点关注滥用人工智能技术违反反歧视法或存在欺骗行为的公司。


FTC主席莉娜·可汗（Lina Khan）和委员黎贝卡·斯劳特（Rebecca Slaughter）及阿尔瓦罗·贝多亚（Alvaro Bedoya）都参加了美国国会举行的听证会，他们被问及与最近的人工智能创新有关的担忧。这项技术可以用于制作高质量的“深度伪造”，从而产生更具欺骗性的骗局以及其他违法行为。


贝多亚表示，使用算法或人工智能的企业不得违反民权法律，也不得违规采取不公平或具有欺骗性的行为。


他表示，黑匣子不能成为无法解释算法的借口。


可汗也认为最新的人工智能技术可以帮助不法分子开展欺诈活动。她同时表示，任何不当行为“都应该得到FTC的制裁”。


斯劳特指出，FTC在100年的历史上一直都要适应不断变化的技术，而适应ChatGPT和其他人工智能工具也并无不同。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Firefox 发布 112 版本，为我们带来了显示密码的新选择、同时改进了标签管理等。


Mozilla 于 2023 年 4 月 11 日发布了 Firefox 112，新版本包含一些令人兴奋的新功能和改进。该浏览器的最新版本带来了一些功能以增强用户体验和提高性能。



本次更新最明显的其中一个功能是，你只需右键单击密码字段即可显示密码。对于那些容易忘记登录凭据的人来说，这是一个方便的工具。



如今，Firefox 允许 Ubuntu Linux 用户从 Chromium Snap 包导入浏览器数据。但是，此功能仅在 Firefox 未以 Snap 包安装时才有效，这一问题 Mozilla 正在努力解决了。

在标签管理方面，Firefox 112 提供了一个新的选项，可以通过在标签列表面板中用鼠标中键点击来关闭标签。此外，快捷键 (Cmd/Ctrl)-Shift-T 用于取消关闭标签，当同一会话中没有更多已关闭的标签需要重新打开时，它现在会恢复之前的会话。

Firefox 还扩展了已知跟踪参数列表，对于 ETP Strict 用户，这些参数会从 URL 中删除。这进一步保护用户免受跨站点跟踪。

新的更新还可以在 Windows 中的英特尔 GPU 上叠加软件解码视频。这提高了缩小的视频质量，并减少了 GPU 的使用。

在其他功能方面，已弃用的 U2F Javascript API 现在默认处于禁用状态。但是，U2F 协议仍然可以通过 WebAuthn API 使用，并且可以使用 security.webauth.u2f 首选项重新启用 U2F API。

最后，日期选择器面板中添加了一个新的清除按钮，允许用户快速清除类型为“日期”或“本地日期-时间”的输入，从而为跨浏览器的用户体验提供一致性。

Firefox 112 可在 Windows、Mac 和 Linux 上下载，我们鼓励用户将浏览器更新到最新版本以获得更流畅、更安全的浏览体验。

你可以立即从以下链接下载最新版本。


下载 Firefox 112


或者，你可以再等几天，Linux 发行版会对它进行测试并通过定期发行版更新让你也能用上 Firefox 112。

《圣经》曾记载伊甸园在东方，那里有幼发拉底河、底格里斯河、基训河和比逊河四条滋润人类的河流，克里斯托弗·哥伦布（Cristóbal Colón）将印度作为其航海的梦想坐标，却惊喜地发现了一片未经开垦的富饶大陆。五百多年前，意大利航海家阿美利哥·韦斯普奇（Amerigo Vespucci）在考察南美洲东海岸时提出这是一块新大陆的构想，因此获得美洲以他名字命名的“殊荣”：美洲“阿美利加”（America）是其名“阿美利哥”拉丁文写法的阴性变格。阿美利哥曾描述：“如果这世上有人间天堂，我认为它一定离此地不远。”这个离人间天堂不远的地方便是拉丁美洲。当伊比利亚人第一次踏上这片极具异域风情的大陆时，惊讶于眼前壮丽的自然风貌，将它视作上帝构造的伊甸园。人们从未见过这里光芒耀眼的金刚鹦鹉和绿咬鹃，成千上万的奇特物种打开了欧洲人遐想的脑洞，叹为观止的自然奇景让他们将伊甸园的中心重新构想在了南美。1656年，知名学者安东尼奥·德·莱昂·皮内罗（António de Leon Pinelo）出版的《新世界的天堂》给予起源伊甸园的四条河流新的名字，它们是亚马逊河、马格达莱纳河、奥里诺科河和拉普拉塔河。
五百多年后的今天，人们提起拉丁美洲，依然会为其魔幻神奇的大自然拍案叫绝：长满奇花异果的热带雨林、沃野千里的潘帕斯草原、延绵不绝的安第斯山脉，还有气势磅礴的伊瓜苏瀑布、鬼斧神工的阿塔卡玛沙漠和皓月星辰的天空之境，既纯美又狂野。这最初被视作天堂的伊甸园孕育了生生不息的美洲文明，那么在1492年哥伦布“发现新大陆”之前，古印第安文明曾如何在大自然中获取所需、求得生存和发展？又如何因殖民的到来无法延续？欧洲殖民者的征服如何改变并破坏了美洲的自然风貌？历经几个世纪，在新旧…]]></summary>

understanding of the sinking feeling that results from opening one's inbox
and seeing a response from Linus Torvalds to a pull request.  When all goes
well, pull requests are acted upon silently; a response usually means that
all has not gone well.  Several maintainers got to experience that
feeling during the 6.3 merge window, which seemed to generate more than the
usual number of grumpy responses related to merge commits.  Avoiding that
situation is not hard, though, with a bit of attention paid to how merges
are done.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Auto-GPT 将人工智能“套娃”

最近，一个名为 AutoGPT 的新人工智能工具发布了，它比 ChatGPT 更有潜力。它可以执行人类级别的任务，并利用 GPT-4 的能力来开发一个可以独立运作而不受用户干扰的 AI 代理。它是一个实验性的、开源的 Python 应用程序，它使用 ChatGPT/GPT-4 来自主地行动。AutoGPT 使用“套娃”的概念来递归地调用自己，这是一种让 AI 模型使用其他模型作为工具或媒介来完成任务的方法。AutoGPT 使用这种方法，并在 ChatGPT 和 GPT-4 的帮助下，通过迭代自己的提示创建完整的项目。人们称，Auto-GPT 是通用人工智能（AGI）的第一个真正的缩影。

老王点评：虽然距离 AGI 还有距离，但是能“自动”解决问题的 AI，距离下一步可以自主运行的 AI 又有多远呢？




Java 21 的一个提案将使它更容易学习

计划在 9 月发布的 JDK 21 中有一个默认禁用的预览语言功能，它提议在 Java 中引入灵活的 main 方法和匿名 main 类，这将使 Java 变得更容易被学习。根据该提案，它将允许省略 main 方法的 String[] 参数，并允许 main 方法既不公开也不静态；引入匿名 main 类，声明隐含 main 类。比如 Hello World 程序只需要这样一行：void main() { System.out.println("Hello, World!");}。

老王点评：这样的 Java 是不是看起来平易近人多了？




西部数据被窃取到了 10 TB 数据

西部数据本月初证实它在 3 月 26 日遭到入侵，但没有透露更多信息。参与此次攻击的一名黑客公开接受采访，披露了更多相关信息。黑客称他们从西部数据窃取到了大约 10 TB 数据，正在谈判索要至少八位数的赎金。作为证据，黑客分享了一份使用西数证书签名的文件，以证明他们已经获取到了该证书。黑客表示他们入侵的目的是获利，因此没有用勒索软件加密西数的文件，如果西数拒绝或不理睬他们的要求，他们将会公开西数的数据。


消息来源：Tech Crunch



老王点评：根据另外一份报告，83% 的企业被勒索后都会先期支付部分赎金。]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[最近看完美剧《最后生还者》第一季，非常想再玩一遍《最后生还者》游戏，《最后生还者1》我已经玩了80多个小时，想玩玩《最后生还者2》，由于《最后生还者2》饱受玩家差评，我一直没玩，这些天看到索尼游戏商店打折出售这个游戏（仅77港币），于是就购买下来玩了一遍，感受颇深。


《最后生还者2》的剧情非常长了，我通关差不多用了30个小时，打的非常疲劳，特别是艾比关卡的BOSS非常恶心，几乎打光了弹药才过关，西雅图第三天本来以为已经结束了，没想到后面又多了个圣芭芭拉剧情线，简直累死人了，从这点看，顽皮狗公司在游戏制作上还是花了很大功夫，做为玩家来说，不知道是不是应该夸夸顽皮狗，3A游戏做出这种时长来也算是很有良心了。


通关下来，我感觉，《最后生还者2》获得玩家差评是有原因的，虽然从游戏操控技术上，2代比1代有了很多进步，特别是通关一次之后再打第二周目，就可以开通游戏自带的修改器，无限弹药、无限制作、一击毙命等等，整个游戏的体验迅速起飞，让游戏难度变成0，可以说，如果只看技术和操作体验层面，《最后生还者2》是顽皮狗制作游戏的巅峰之作，但是，做为一款类互动电影游戏，剧情在整个游戏的重要性是举足轻重的，《最后生还者2》在剧情上的问题实在是无法忽视。


《最后生还者2》这个游戏最大的问题在于编剧，游戏的编剧让我们玩家玩了一个很不爽的游戏，游戏一开头，先把一代的游戏男主角灭了，还强迫玩家操控杀人凶手，而一代备受欢迎的游戏女主角艾莉，不仅仅从一个人见人爱的萌妹子变成了一个英姿飒爽的小帅哥，还成为了一个不知好歹、情商低下、没有同理心、不懂得珍惜他人感情的渣男小笨蛋，所有关心爱护她的人都没有好下场，游戏里的好人自相残杀，恶人胡作非为，游戏编剧写出这样的剧本，恐怕就是为了恶心我们玩家吧，看到玩家越玩越难受，游戏编剧以此获得一种低廉的满足感。


本来玩个游戏就是为了爽，《最后生还者1》的剧情就很爽，恐怖的地方让人毛骨悚然，感人的地方让人热泪盈眶，但《最后生还者2》的剧情怎么走上了“伦理”这条路，非要让玩家纠结一些不爽的事情。


说到伦理，其实编剧认为正确的伦理也未必那么正确，例如乔尔在《最后生还者1》最后的选择，这也是艾莉指责乔尔的地方，也是2代游戏的起因，曾经引起很多争议的地方，我认为乔尔的选择是合情合理，无需指责的。


《最后生还者1》的结局，火萤组织试图通过艾莉获取疫苗，但手术却会让艾莉送命，乔尔面临选择保护艾莉还是选择疫苗来拯救世界，乔尔最终选择了艾莉。


从《最后生还者2》的故事情节我们知道，乔尔杀了火萤领袖玛琳之后，火萤组织即土崩瓦解，人员大量流失，这说明火萤并不是一个很靠谱的组织，实力非常弱，这样的机构很难承担起研发拯救人类疫苗的责任。此外，乔尔杀的那名医生，是火萤组织唯一一名懂疫苗的医生，这说明火萤组织的研发资金非常薄弱，没有足够的研发实力，否则不可能只有一名医生懂疫苗，由这样的组织通过手术来获取疫苗很不靠谱，最终的结局极有可能是，疫苗没有研发成功，艾莉却白死了，乔尔救艾莉是没有什么问题的，艾莉因为这个而迁怒乔尔只能说明其智商低下。正确的做法是，艾莉好好活着保护好疫苗，等待研发实力强大的团队来进行研究，采取不让艾莉送命就能提取出疫苗的方法，相信这对于靠谱的研发团队来说并不是难事。


总之，相比《最后生还者1》的剧情，《最后生还者2》的剧情相差很大，问题也很多，《最后生还者1》主题是爱，《最后生还者2》却把主题变成恨，遭到玩家的抵制也是合情合理的。


希望美剧《最后生还者》第二季不要像游戏那样以仇恨为主题，还是回归以爱为主题更好，至少那样不会让玩家这么不舒服。]]></summary>

或者你可能需要上传由不同文件组成的单个文件？许多政府和学术门户网站都要求这样做。

作为 Linux 用户，如果你遇到需要合并 PDF 的情况，本教程将帮助你。

在本教程中，我将分享三种合并多个 PDF 文件的方法：


使用 PDF Tricks GUI 工具

使用 LibreOffice（允许你选择页面）

使用 ImageMagick 命令行工具（Linux 教程会没有终端方法就结束么？）


你可以全部了解一下并选择最适合你的。

方法 1：使用 PDF Tricks GUI 工具在 Linux 中合并 PDF

在试用了多种 GUI 工具后，我发现 PDF Tricks 使用简单且易于导航。

此外，除了合并 PDF 文件之外，它还包括其他功能，包括：


压缩 PDF。

拆分 PDF。

将 PDF 转换为 JPG、PNG 和文本格式。


它以 Flatpak 的形式提供。请 确保你的 Linux 系统启用了 Flatpak 支持。

我分享的是在 Ubuntu 上启用 Flatpak 的步骤：

sudo apt install flatpak
flatpak remote-add --if-not-exists flathub https://flathub.org/repo/flathub.flatpakrepo


现在，使用以下命令在你的系统中安装 PDF Tricks：

flatpak install flathub com.github.muriloventuroso.pdftricks


完成安装后，从系统菜单中打开 PDF Tricks 应用。

第一次运行时，你会得到一个可以使用此工具执行的操作列表。显然，…]]></summary>

TUXEDO 电脑是 Linux 领域的一个著名品牌，它提供了不同价格/性能的可定制的 Linux 笔记本和台式电脑。

顺便说一句，它是值得信赖的 购买 Linux 电脑 的地方之一。

在最近的公告中，他们推出了 Stellaris 16 英寸笔记本电脑的下一个进化版。

我必须说，这可以成为 Framework 最近宣布的高性能 16 英寸笔记本电脑的有力挑战者。

让我们来看看它。

TUXEDO Stellaris 16 Gen 5 概览



这款笔记本电脑的主要亮点是，它采用了英伟达最新、最强大的 RTX40 系列 笔记本 GPU，提供了强大的图形性能和功能。

搭配了英特尔的顶级处理器 i9 13900HX，其 24 个核心可以在高达 157W TDP（睿频）的情况下超频到 极快的 5.40 GHz，这是一个引人注目的组合。

但请记住，为了充分发挥笔记本电脑的运行潜力，TUXEDO 建议使用 他们的外部水冷却解决方案，TUXEDO Aquaris，它可以通过磁力连接到笔记本电脑的背面。


📋 在订购该笔记本电脑时，你必须为此支付额外费用。


该处理器在没有全速运行时，基本 TDP 为 55W，时钟速度为 3.90GHz。

对于这样一台轻薄的笔记本电脑来说，这仍然是一个不错的性能数字！ 😮

Stellaris 16 - Gen5 笔记本电脑的一些其它关键亮点如下：


外壳 1是由铝和塑料的组合组成。

一个 240 赫兹的 16 英寸 IPS 显示屏，支持英伟达 G-SYNC。

GPU 最高可选英伟达 RTX 4090。

高达 64GB DDR5，5600MHz 的内存（2x32GB）。

劳费尔（Berthold Laufer, 1874-1934）

上海的中西书局于2023年推出一套西文大书《劳费尔著作集》。劳费尔是二十世纪最伟大的东方学者、汉学家。他的论文的辑录出版，以往有德国学者魏汉茂（Hartmut Walravens）整理的Berthold Laufer: Kleinere Schriften（Wiesbaden: Franz Steiner Verlag, 1976-1992）三大卷，有关汉藏关系方面的劳氏著述也已于多年前结为专集出版：Sino-Tibetan Studies（Hartmut Walravens and Lokesh Chandra eds., 2 Vols., New Delhi: Rakesh Goel, 1987）。在魏汉茂所纂劳费尔作品总目（Werkverzeichnis）的基础上，本书编者黄曙辉先生现将劳氏大多数单篇论文和短篇幅著作集为一编，影印为十三册出版。这是世界东方学界的一大事件，因为劳费尔是古今不多觏的大学者，作品具有永恒的价值。他的论文发表于美国、欧洲的多种期刊、文集、报纸，非常分散，不易汇集。近年来因e考据时代的来临，颇有有心人纂辑劳费尔著作的电子文本的链接，功莫大焉，学者称便。纸本图书便于图书馆收藏，专业学者和高段位读者藉此也容易从容阅读、批点。一言以蔽之，沪版《劳费尔著作集》将成为今后相当长时期内劳氏著作的一个重要版本，必将为海内外学界、读书界重视，“洛阳纸贵”（本书定价九千九百八十元），不卜可知。
中西书局版这个论文合集，以劳费尔原作的发表年代为序排列，是编辑这位百科全书式学者著作的唯一明智又合理的作法。劳费尔的单本著作不在本书的收录范围内。中西书局的“寰宇文献”汉学名著影印系列已收录劳费尔所著《中国古玉》（…]]></summary>

        <link href="https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/12om804/version_150_of_graphs_released_a_data_plotting/"/>
        <updated>2023-04-16T19:39:47.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Today I am happy to announce version 1.5.0 of Graphs! Graphs is a simple yet powerful tool for plotting and manipulation of data. Graphs supports a wide array of file formats, including .txt, .dat, .xy and even now Panalytical .xrdml files. You can import data from two-column files or generate data form an equation. Plus, you can do data manipulation such as cutting data, translation, multiplication normalizations, fourier transforms, derivatives and much more.
 Our new style editor makes it easier than ever to create beautiful graphs for professional settings at work and school. It’s honestly my first tool of choice for the figures I use in academic publishing and my PhD thesis. Your graphs can be exported in a wide array of file formats, including vector svg images for further refinement in e.g. Inkscape.
 This is a major update that follows the GNOME HIG guidelines to the largest extent. The biggest changes to highlight since last version are the ability to save projects, allowing you to save your current session as a separate file to continue working on it later, a fully featured style editor to create your own plot styles and the general UI overhaul. Plus tons of bug fixes and optimizations under the hood. If you’re interested in trying out Graphs 1.5.0 you can find on Flathub!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[4月14日，在2022年度人民文学奖颁出之际，一场文学畅谈会在赤水河畔举行。贾平凹、舒婷、徐刚、徐则臣、陈涛等作家参与其中，谈到了ChatGPT对文学创作带来的影响。贾平凹、舒婷还对年轻的写作者表达了特别的期待。 


“90后”作家，本届新人奖得主栗鹿和朋友们都尝试过ChatGPT，大家发现给它一个命题，它可以非常完整地写出一篇还不错的小说。栗鹿说：“它的发展和进化会让现在的写作者感到一点恐慌，但是对现在的我们来说，我们能做到的是跟朋友们有更多的相聚，更多地看到他者，这是可以滋养到我们的内心和我们的文学的一种存在。” 


“90后”作家，另一位新人奖得主康岩告诉澎湃新闻记者，ChatGPT对一般性意义写作的冲击与撼动是毋庸置疑的，比如新闻通讯、会议稿件、重复性高的网络文学等，但对独具性灵的写作而言，在可以预见的未来，GPT想要替代，还应该很难。“人工智能可以构建情节、描绘人物、叙述故事，但不可能写出独一无二的‘这一个’，因为每个作家的眼光都是独一无二的，像是屈光镜一样，对现实进行独一无二的折射，写出来的东西一定是泥沙俱下，精致与粗糙并存，稚嫩与深刻同在。这种不二个性人工智能不可能完美复刻和模仿，托尔斯泰和鲁迅不可能被机器替代。” 


在本届长篇小说奖得主庞贝看来，ChatGPT确实可以参与到某些创作套路的设计，比如类型小说或影视剧的情节设计，但套路性的东西就难有真正的原创性，机器计算当然也难以生成有独特情感、温度和思想的文本，这也是真正的艺术存活的理由。因此，真正的好作家不必悲观，这种挑战和危机，有望激发真正的创造力。


《人民文学》副主编徐则臣感慨，科技会产生加速度发展，而今ChatGPT越来越完善，回答越来越正确，写出来的东西越来越令人满意，但最终它不是一个人，它缺少了文学里的内容和匠人精神。“从这个角度来讲，可能ChatGPT又不是我们需要担心的一个问题，但它给我们提了个醒，需要我们把自己的技艺更好地往前推进，一骑绝尘。只有这样，你才能远远地把ChatGPT等人工智能甩开，否则我们这个行当的确会变成一个高危的职业。” 


《人民文学》副主编陈涛也认为ChatGPT的出现对文学写作者的影响很大，随着升级迭代，它足以挑战并战胜绝大多数的写作者。“但ChatGPT的出现并不是一件很坏的事情，它的本质属性是工具性。同时，ChatGPT毕竟还是技术，它也催逼着我们写作者从浮躁的状态下沉静下来，努力创作出有着个人风格与辨识度的，能够代表人类思想高度与人性深度的优秀作品。”

FSF 暗指谷歌为了自己的专有格式而放弃 JEPG-XL

自由软件基金会（FSF）撰文称，“谷歌决定废除 JPEG-XL 强调了浏览器选择的必要性”。谷歌于 2 月份废弃了 JPEG-XL 图像格式，转而支持它自己的专利 AVIF 格式。谷歌的理由是“整个生态系统没有足够的兴趣来继续试验 JPEG-XL”，而无视社区的恳请，并没有对用户的担忧做出回应。JPEG-XL 的删除问题已经成为 Chromium 项目历史上第二大 “明星” 问题。

Python 基金会（PSF）审查了欧盟拟议的《网络弹性法》和《产品责任法》，并报告说 “这些问题使我们组织的使命和开源软件社区的健康受到威胁”。PSF 执行董事认为这些法案“没有区分从未因提供软件而获得报酬的独立作者，和销售产品以换取最终用户付款的企业技术巨头”，“如果拟议的法律按目前的条款执行，开源组件的作者可能要为他们的组件被应用于别人的商业产品的方式承担法律和财务责任。&rdquoSF 认为，欧盟立法者应该为服务于公共利益的公共软件库以及在公共资源库上托管软件包的组织和开发者提供明确的豁免。

由于其可定制性、灵活性和尖端功能，Arch Linux 是高级用户和开发人员中最受欢迎和使用最广泛的 Linux 发行版之一。

由于其极简设计，在 Arch Linux 中安装软件的主要方式是使用终端通过命令行界面 （CLI）。

但并不是每个人都喜欢使用终端。基于图形用户界面（GUI）的包管理器是这些人的必备程序。有几个可选的包管理器。让我们了解一些比较流行的。

在 Arch Linux 上寻找基于 GUI 的包管理器要考虑什么？

在为 Arch Linux 选择基于 GUI 的包管理器时，必须考虑几个因素：

首先，它应该有一个干净易用的界面，对初学者来说很直观。

其次，它应该支持所有包管理操作，例如安装、删除、更新和搜索包。

第三，它应该具有高级功能，例如依赖项解析和对 AUR 包的支持。

最后，它应该是轻量级的，不会占用太多的系统资源。

Arch Linux 的最佳 GUI 包管理器

1、Pamac

此列表中的第一个 GUI 包管理器是 Pamac，它由 Manjaro Linux 团队开发。具有漂亮且用户友好的界面，使其超级易于使用。

其直观的界面使用户可以轻松安装、删除和更新软件包。它建立在支持 AUR 的 libalpm 之上。Pamac 还支持 Snap 和 Flatpak 的 appstream:/// 协议。因此，你可以直接从 appstream 链接启动该应用安装程序。此外，它还具有高级功能，例如依赖项解析和对 AUR 包的支持。此外，Pamac 是轻量级的，不会占用太多系统资源。



使用其 GUI，你可以浏览 Arch 仓库，还可以根据其功能查看应用。Pamac GUI 中有单独的部分，可以使你能够删除和卸载…]]></summary>

OpenBSD 7.3 已经正式 发布，这是该系统的第 54 个版本。这个最新的版本建立在 OpenBSD 令人印象深刻的傲人记录之上 —— 它是一个安全可靠的操作系统，在二十多年的使用过程中，在默认安装中只发现了两个远程漏洞。

与以前的版本一样，OpenBSD 7.3 在广泛的系统领域提供了显著的改进。其中包括内核的改进，如增加了 waitid(2)、pinsyscall(2)、 getthrname(2) 和 setthrname(2) 函数，以及 waitid(2) 的 WTRAPPED 选项，等等。此外，新的内核 autoconf_serial sysctl(8) 允许用户区监控内核设备树状态的变化。

直接渲染管理器和图形驱动已经更新，引入了对 Ryzen 7000 “Raphael” 和 Ryzen 7020 和 7045 系列处理器以及 Radeon RX 7900 XT/XTX “Navi 31” 的支持，并改进了苹果芯片笔记本电脑和联想 x13s 的问题的解决方案。

此外，还改进了对网络硬件的支持，例如启用了 em(4) IPv4、 TCP 和 UDP 校验卸载，以及 82575、 82576、 i350 和 i210 芯片组设备上的硬件 VLAN 标记， 以及改进了 mcx(4) 性能。



除了上述的改进，OpenBSD 7.3 还包括一系列新的或改进的硬件和软件对 端口源码包Port 和 二进制软件包Package 的支持。一些来自外部供应商的主要组件包括 Xenocara、LLVM/Clang、GCC、Perl、NSD、Unbound、Ncurses、Binutils、Gdb、Awk 和 Expat。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[刘奕（章静绘）

上海大学中文系教授刘奕多年来潜心于陶渊明研究，近日，其论著《诚与真——陶渊明考论》的新版由上海古籍出版社出版，该书就陶渊明的生平、作品、精神世界、文学风貌中“重要而又文献足征”的问题进行了全面深入的探讨。刘奕认为该书与其说是他的陶渊明研究，毋宁视为他对陶渊明的理解，而“诚之以求真”就是他对陶渊明人生哲学及实践的概括。在接受《上海书评》的专访中，他说：“我认为陶渊明所思所行始终围绕如何安顿身心，如何获得自由展开。我想知道的是，他究竟是如何从思想资源中汲取所需，如何去实践，最后才能安顿身心，在作品中呈现出一个既笃实诚悫，又真率潇洒的形象。”

《诚与真：陶渊明考论》，刘奕著，上海古籍出版社2023年2月出版，538页，108.00元

先从书名说起吧，这本《陶渊明考论》的主书名“诚与真”来自特里林的《诚与真》，在那本书里讨论到了关于作者在作品中表达出来的情感与实际情感之间是否一致的问题，而在您对陶渊明的考论里我是不是可以理解为您觉得他其人其文都是“诚且真”的？
刘奕：如果要更准确地表达，这本书的名字应该叫“诚之以求真”。我很喜欢特里林的《诚与真》，喜欢他在保守与自由之间博通圆融的手眼，于是借用这个书名，有向特里林“致敬”的意思。在特里林那里，诚是真诚，真是真实，他认为二者在西方语境中其实是贯穿现代性“自我”的基本问题。在十六十七世纪，社会性自我最初被认识到之后，人们希望保持外在的社会自我与内在的精神自我的统一，这种内外统一就是真诚。到了十八世纪，这种内外统一产生了冲突与分裂，精神自我开始渴望突破社会的束缚。于是一种新的卢梭式的真诚观出现，它要忠于的是那个不变的精神自我。但这个不变的灵魂式的自我却有惺惺作态的嫌疑。于是到了十九世纪，文学家开始在生命和生活的真实状态中去发掘一个真实的自我，去揭示出包裹生命的种种虚饰，以此完成文化上的自我重塑。这个重塑的自我既是觉醒…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi. I'm happy to announce that version 1.15 of the C++ Middleware Writer (CMW) is available with: 
 Support for more data types for message lengths. Previously message lengths were always 4 bytes. I used this, for example, to reduce the size of the type used for message lengths between the front and middle tiers of the CMW from 4 bytes to 2 bytes.
 Support for std::variant.
 The middle tier is Linux-only now rather than POSIX/poll based. After porting the back tier of the CMW from kevent to io_uring, I decided to use io_uring in the middle tier also.
 Refactoring and bug fixes.
 As ever, suggestions for upcoming releases are welcome. One thing I've been thinking about is making the software available on flathub.

CentOS 项目已经发出了关于 CentOS Linux 7 和 CentOS Stream 8 的终结日期的提醒。CentOS Linux 7 计划在 2024 年 6 月 30 日结束，因为 RHEL 7 也于同期结束。CentOS Stream 8 计划在 2024 年 5 月 31 日之后不再生产任何新的构建，这也预示着 RHEL 8.10 将是该系列最后一个版本。而曾经作为 RHEL 下游的 CentOS 8 已经在 2021 年 12 月 31 日结束使用。


消息来源：CentOS



老王点评：可能你已经被它们之间的复杂关系迷惑，不过，CentOS 停服这件事看来余波甚远啊。




ChatGPT 为“身兼多职”的提供了更多机会

一些从事多份工作的人已经在网上聚集起来，他们称自己为 “过度就业者”。在大流行以来，越来越的人开始居家办公，这给他们同时接受多份全职工作雇佣提供了可能。而现在，ChatGPT 更使他们如虎添翼，而雇主并不知道。一位受访者称，“ChatGPT 做了我 80% 的工作”。他甚至用它来生成申请工作的求职信。一位技术工人将 ChatGPT 整合到他的工作过程中后，他的工作数量从两份增加到四份。他说：“我认为五份工作可能有点过头了。”


消息来源：VICE



老王点评：这才是真正把被 AI 抢去工作变成让 AI 帮你抢来更多工作。




英伟达的顶级 AI 芯片在 eBay 上的售价超过 4 万美元

去年发布的 H100 是英伟达最新的旗舰人工智能芯片，接替了之前被称为人工智能应用主力的 A100。周五，至少有 8 块 H100 在 eBay 上零售，最高价格约为 46,000 美元。开发人员正在使用 H100 构建大型语言模型，这是 OpenAI 的 ChatGPT 等人工智能应用的核心所在。像 GPT 这样的大型模型，需要数百个高端的英伟达 GPU 共同工作。


消息来源：CNBC



老王点评：又一轮的显卡抢购潮，英伟达这种公司已经嘴都乐歪了吧。]]></summary>

 There is no way for it to reliably get a signal that the kernel wants it dead, thus no way to reliably allocate as much memory as possible and then free it when the kernel decides that it needs more memory.
 And yeah, I know you receive SIGTERM when the OOM killer wants you dead, but if you're out of heap space, it can't and won't signal you.
 So if I'm not missing anything (please tell me if I'm wrong), the only way is to monitor memory usage of my program + memory usage of the whole system, resulting in complicated and error prone code as there might be a race between checking whether I take too much memory and when the OOM wants me dead.
 I opened this thread because there might be something I missed, for example, maybe I can allocate some heap space ahead of time that is reserved for when the OOM kicks in, so that I will always receive the SIGTERM or something like that.
 Thanks!
 EDIT: First of all the response is amazing, thanks everyone for your time. Second, what I would imagine in a "perfect" system is that a process can get notified before dying from OOM, or at least before a configured memory limit (for example using cgroups), as processes might or even want to free some memory, it's not a problem for them (i.e some kind of caching), this would be way more robust then polling like system-oomd, earlyoom, low-memory-monitor, Android's lowmemorykiller daemon, Facebook's oomd, Endless' psi-monitor, and so on...

傅璇琮先生


“纪念傅璇琮先生90诞辰暨《傅璇琮文集》发布会”活动现场

首先要向清华人文学院、刘石教授以及我的老同事中华书局学术中心的编校同仁，表示我个人由衷的敬意，感谢大家为傅先生《文集》付出的辛劳。
《文集》是我动议的，也参加了前期的体例商讨，刘石教授慨然支持并承担起组织落实工作，使《文集》顺利启动。这时已经是2021年10月，年底我就卸任了，一直到今年2月国林发我会议邀请，上周拿到样书，非常惊叹《文集》编校工作的高效和《文集》规模之巨大、成书之典重精美。
本周我用三个日夜，翻阅了二十四册《文集》，主要读纯学术文章以外的篇章，感触很多。傅先生1992年为《文史知识》写了一篇《读〈启功丛稿〉一得》，说：“过了10年，正如白居易所说，年岁渐长，阅事渐多，近日重读这部著作，产生出一种从未有过的亲切感，享受到一种在学识追求上得到极大满足的愉悦。”（《驼草集》937页）读到这里，我想，傅先生说出了我读《文集》的最准确的感受。

1991年，作者（右二）与傅璇琮先生（正中）在北京十渡合影


1998年，作者（右二）与傅璇琮先生（正中）在贵阳合影

在2016年9月唐代文学学会成都年会为傅先生举行的追思会，我讲了对傅先生的两点认识——一是“丁酉之祸”对傅先生的影响；二是编辑职业对傅先生学术形成的影响力。这次重读，加深了对傅先生的理解。
简单讲感触最深的两点。
一、傅先生柔弱、谦和的外表下有强毅、强大的品格和对学术追求的强烈信念。
傅先生《文集》中多处回忆被打成“右派”，到商务、中华工作初期的情况，在那么重的政治压力下，“我这个人毕竟是个书生，从50年代起，不管环境如何，总是抓时间读书作文”。1973年从干校回京后，“虽已是文革后期，但政治运动仍很频繁，且当时还没有个人著作…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[一个有趣的、开源的私人通讯软件，它利用 Tor 来保证你的通信安全和私密。


Speek 是一种网络通讯服务，它利用多种技术保证网络聊天的私密性。

它是端到端加密的、去中心化和开源的。

毫无疑问，它的目标是将自己定位为 WhatsApp 的替代品 之一和 Linux 上的 Signal 的竞争对手。

那么，它到底如何呢？ 让我们一起来仔细看看细节。

Speek! 适用于 Linux 和安卓的点对点即时消息应用程序

（LCTT 译注： 点对点Peer-to-Peer，又称对等式网络，是无中心服务器、依靠 对等点peer 交换信息的互联网络体系，它的作用在于，减低以往网路传输中的节点，以降低资料遗失的风险。）



Speek!（名称中带有感叹号）是一种加密的聊天软件，旨在抗审查，同时保护数据隐私。

你也可以认为它是 Session 的替代品，但有一些区别。

与其他可用的通讯软件相比，它是一个相当新的竞争对手。但是如果你想尝试开源的解决方案，它应该作为候选者。

虽然 Speek! 声称能保持匿名，但如果你需要的是完全匿名的话，你应该始终注意自己在设备上的活动。因为你需要考虑的不仅仅是即时通讯软件。



Speek! 利用去中心化的 Tor 网络来保证安全性和私密性。不仅如此，这样做可以让你无需电话号码就能使用服务。你只需要你的 Speek ID 就可以与人联系，而别人很难知道你的 ID。

（LCTT 译注：Tor 是一个可以实现匿名通信的自由软件。其名源于 洋葱路由器The Onion Router 的英文缩写。）

Speek! 的亮点



Speek! 的一些主要亮点包括：


端到端加密：除收件人外，没有人可以查看你的消息。

通过 TOR 路由流量：使用 TOR 路由消息，增强隐私。

没有中央服务器：增加了对审查的抵抗力，因为很难关闭服务。此外，没有针对黑客的单一攻击点。

无需注册：无需共享任何个人信息即可开始使用该服务。你只需要一个公钥来识别/添加用户。

自毁聊天：当你关闭应用程序时，消息会自动删除。增添了额外的隐私和安全性。

无元数据：它会在你交换消息时消除任何元数据。

私人文件共享：你还可以使用该服务安全地共享文件。


下载适用于 Linux 和其他平台的 Speek!

你可以从他们的 官方网站 下载 Speek!。

在撰写本文时，Speek! 仅适用于 Linux、安卓、macOS 和 Windows。

对于 Linux，你会找到一个 AppImage 文件。如果你不知道 AppImage，可以参考我们的 AppImage 指南 来运行该应用程序。



另外，Google Play 商店 上的安卓应用程序还比较早期。因此，你在尝试使用它时可以期待一下它的改进。

Speek!

关于 Speek! 的用户体验

这个应用的用户体验非常令人满意，包含了所有必备的功能。它可以更好，但已经很不错了。

嗯，关于 Speek! 的 GUI 没什么好说的。GUI 非常极简风。它的核心是一个聊天应用程序，而它做得恰如其分。没有动态，没有附近的人，没有不必要的附加组件。

在我使用这个应用程序的有限时间里，我很满意它的功能。它提供的功能使其成为一款出色的聊天应用程序，可通过其背后的所有技术提供安全和私密的消息传递体验。

如果将它与一些商业上更成功的聊天软件进行比较，它在功能上存在不足。但话又说回来，Speek! 的设计就不是一个只关注用户体验的时尚聊天应用。

因此，我只向注重隐私的用户推荐 Speek!。如果你想要平衡用户体验和功能，你可能希望继续使用像 Signal 这样的私人聊天软件。

你对于 Speek 又有什么看法？对于注重隐私的用户来说，它是一个很好的私人聊天软件吗？ 请在下方评论区告诉我你的想法。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[《林达夫与他的时代》，[日]渡边一民著，岩波书店1988年出版，中译本即出

谁是林达夫（1896-1984）？为什么要翻译渡边一民写的《林达夫与他的时代》？我想这大概是每一位看到这本传记的中国读者首先会想到的问题。笔者想引用最近被翻译成中文的《鹤见俊辅传》传主说过的一句话。在给《林达夫著作集》第五卷《政治的民俗学》写的解说里，鹤见俊辅说林达夫“在日本论坛史上是知识人里错得最少的那个”。可别小看这样一句话，鹤见俊辅这位在日本战后思想史上留下很大足迹的思想家用这样的赞词来评价林达夫这位前辈，实在是很不简单的事情——如果了解一下二十世纪日本思想文化史上有多少人转向、有多少大知识分子做出过离谱的误判的话。
在进入二十一世纪之际，耄耋之年的鹤见俊辅亲自监修了一套三卷本《林达夫文选》，以便新世纪的读者了解这位罕见的百科全书式思想家、政治判断力超群的大知识人——在笔者看来，林达夫虽然不是职业政治思想家，但他的政治判断力堪与托尼·朱特视为精神导师的法国哲人雷蒙·阿隆媲美，跟他很尊敬的英国哲人以撒亚·伯林也不相上下。在书店看到时，我还担心会有多少人读这位昭和时代大学者的著作，谁知很快售罄。2005年林达夫的两本代表作——《历史的黄昏》与《共产主义者》被收入中央公论新社出版的《中公经典丛书》。这套书里收入了自《圣经》、柏拉图的对话录到列维-斯特劳斯的《忧郁的热带》等世界名著，很像商务印书馆出的“汉译世界学术名著丛书”。这又一次体现了林达夫作为经典作家的地位。上一次是在1974年，林达夫的代表性文章被汇为一册收入筑摩书房出版的《近代日本思想大系》。看总共三十六卷的大系的书单，从福泽谕吉到西田几多郎、柳田国男和小林秀雄，所有近现代有代表性的日本思想家都列入其中。
鹤见俊辅监修的文选出版没几年，林达夫谈艺术的代表性文章由亲炙过林达夫的著名评论家高桥英夫编为《林达夫艺术论集》，收入著名的讲谈社文艺文…]]></summary>

我叫 Neil Naveen，我是一个 14 岁的初中生，已经有七年的编码经验。我使用 Golang 编码也有两年了。

不过，编码并不是我唯一的爱好。我练习柔术已经有四年了，并参加过多次比赛。我对编码和柔术充满热情，因为它们教给了我重要的人生课程。

Codecombat

我在 Codecombat 上开始编码，它教会了我许多基本的编码技巧。

在我的编码历程中，最激动人心的时刻之一是我在 Codecombat 主办的多人竞技场中，在大约 50,000 名玩家中排名第 16。当时我只有 11 岁，这对我来说是一个不可思议的成就。它给了我继续探索和学习新事物的信心。

Leetcode

在 Codecombat 之后，我转到了 leetcode.com。通过解决这个网站量身定制的问题，来磨练我的算法编码技能，以学习特定的算法。

Coding Game

当我 13 岁时，我转到了 Coding Game 的机器人编程。这里的竞争更加激烈，因此我必须采用更好的算法。例如，在创建终极 井字游戏tic-tac-toe人工智能时，我使用了 极小化极大算法Minimax 和 蒙特卡洛树搜索Monte Carlo Tree Search 等算法，使我的代码快速高效。

GitHub CLI

有一天，我看到爸爸在使用一个叫 GitHub CLI 的开源工具，我被它迷住了。GitHub CLI 是一个允许用户直接从命令行与 GitHub 的 API 互动的工具，而不需要到 GitHub 网站上去。

又有一天，我父亲正在审查一个旨在检测依赖关系中的漏洞的机器人的 拉取请求PR。

后来，我思考了 GitHub CLI 和这个机器人，并想知道 GitHub CLI 本身是否被一个安全机器人所监控。事实证明它没有。

所以我创建了一个修复程序，并包含了 GitHub CLI 的安全审计。

令我高兴的是，我的贡献被接受了。它被合并到了项目中，这对我来说是一个激动人心的时刻。能为一个像 GitHub CLI 这样受欢迎的工具的重要项目作出贡献，并帮助保护它，是一个极好的机遇。这是我的 PR 的链接：https://github.com/cli/cli/pull/4473

提交你的代码

我希望我的故事能激励其他年轻人去探索并为开源世界做出贡献。年龄并不是障碍。每个人都应该探索和贡献。如果你想看看我的网站，请到 neilnaveen.dev。你也可以看看我的 Leetcode 个人资料。如果你有兴趣，可以看看我在 CloudNativeSecurityCon 的演讲记录。

我很感激迄今为止我所拥有的机会，我很兴奋地期盼我的未来。谢谢你阅读我的故事!

（LCTT 校注：我也接触过几位初中生，他们在技术和开源方面有这浓厚的兴趣，并取得了令人称道的进展。所以，看到这篇文章的同学们，你也可以的！）

about using open-source software to run a virtual conference.  The Fedora design team
recently ran the first Creative
Freedom Summit as a virtual conference for FOSS creative tools.  The team
could have used the same non-open-source platform that is used by the Flock Fedora conference, but took a
different path:

Using Matrix's Element client, we embedded the live stream video and an
Etherpad into a public Matrix room for the conference. We used attendance
in the channel to monitor overall conference attendance. We had live chat
going throughout the conference and took questions from audience members
both from the chat and the embedded Q&A Etherpad. 


Back in 2020, the Linux Plumbers Conference also put together a virtual conference using free
software, as did LibrePlanet and likely others.]]></summary>

 - informant Used to read the latest news before your upgrade. This can help avoid breaking your system when blindly running pacman -Syu
 - pkgfile which includes the "command not found" hooks for bash, zsh, and fish shells. This is completely useful when you don't know you're missing a command. the command not found hook will let you know what package includes your commands. Need to update .bashrc and logout and back in.
 - paru This is my pacman Wrapper of choice. It works well to pull packages from the official repos, the AUR, and any third party repos configured in you /etc/pacman.conf - Unlock AUR scripts or helpers paru will attempt to pull in any dependencies for you. It is written by the same person that wrote yay
 And lastly, A possibly controversial choice, is Virtualbox for VM's and labs. I use Virtualbox as opposed to vmware or qemu/kvm because it's easy to manage and super flexible. It supports EFI booting, and TPM v1.2 and v2 if you require those for testing or Windows 11. And it's nice to boot a USB in the VM.
 These are only some ideas for noobs. as always ymmv, and choose what works for you.

 I grew tired of making a convoluted bash script to install all my programs across different Linux distributions so here is what i came up with instead:
 Writing it in a data serialization language like yaml or json so i could manage it better.
 Ginst is the half of the story making up for the parser and executor so to say.
 If you're interested see the link below, give it a try, read the source, ask a question or open up an issue.
 Do note that i will probably change stuff in the future.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Connect two articles on Wikipedia, but do it the long way. I've always been a fan of the theory of six degree of separation, but it's an overused concept when exploring the Wiki-graph.
Instead of showing the shortest path, which in my opinion is "boring" and ends up connecting super-important central articles, I came up with my own method: WikiBinge selects the smaller, less represented articles on Wikipedia. In a WikiBinge path, the underdogs are the kings!
How does it work? It's pretty straightforward! Compute PageRank on the Wiki-graph and assign as weight of each edge the PageRank value of the destination node. A WikiBinge path is then simply a shortest path using these weights: the algorithm will then favor paths passing through articles with lower PageRank values.
More on the motives to build this here: https://www.jamez.it/project/wikibinge/
This is an older project of mine, but it never got much exposure, so I'm humbly submitting it now.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[北京时间4月14日晚间消息，据报道，Twitter今日宣布，现允许Twitter Blue付费用户发布长度不超过10000个字符的推文。


Twitter在一份声明中称：“我们正在改进Twitter上的写作和阅读体验！从今天开始，Twitter支持长度不超过10000个字符的推文，支持粗体和斜体文本格式。现在就可以注册Twitter Blue来使用这一新功能。”


Twitter Blue是Twitter的一款订阅产品，每月的费用为8美元。它提供了比免费版本更多的功能，包括一个蓝色的复选标记。


多年来，Twitter对推文的长度限制一直是140个字符，直到2017年才翻了一番，达到280个字符。Twitter CEO埃隆·马斯克（Elon Musk）上个月曾表示，Twitter将很快允许用户发布最多1万个字符的“长篇推文”。


显然，1万个字符的上限可以让用户书写更长形式的推文，类似于一篇标准的文章，而不是Twitter多年来所坚持的“短文本”形式。


与此同时，Twitter还扩大了货币化选项，允许用户订阅他们最喜欢的内容创作者，以换取他们付费内容。马斯克对此表示，创作者将能够获得订阅收入的绝大部分份额。


马斯克称，第一年Twitter将分文不收，内容创作者将获得Twitter所收到的所有“打赏”。例如，如果用户使用iOS或Android系统，创作者收到的订阅费用为70%（平台收取30%）；若使用网页平台，则收到的订阅费用为92%（具体取决于“打赏者”使用的支付服务商）。


而第一年之后，iOS和Android平台收取的费用将降至15%，但推特将在此基础上增加少量费用，具体取决于“打赏金额”。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[One-time passwords (OTPs) are increasingly used as a defense against
phishing and other password-stealing attacks, usually as a part of a
two-factor authentication process.  Perhaps the mostly commonly
used technique is sending a numeric code to a phone via SMS, but SMS OTPs
have security problems of their own.  An alternative is to use time-based
one-time passwords (TOTPs).  The normal TOTP situation is to have all
of the data locked into a proprietary phone app, but it need not be that
way.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A little while ago, my friend was asking me how he could go about trying Linux, and I figured I would find a little guide online to send him. After about an hour of reading through tutorials trying to find a good one to send him, I realized that pretty much all of the ones I read had a few good points, but overall were basically incomplete. I'm going to try writing my own, thus allowing me to piece together everything I went through along the way, as well as everything I think would help new users switch over. I'm basically looking for some suggestions as to things to put inside the guide. If anyone has any anecdotes relating to stuff that helped them when switching, or just general suggestions as to things that would be useful to put inside, please let me know!

国外专业机构最近发表长文测评了龙芯 CPU，并梳理了其历史发展和软件生态。作者认为，与兆芯和飞腾相比，龙芯最新的产品 3A5000 是迄今为止最有希望的中国产的 CPU。当然，测评也指出，龙芯的 LA464 根本无法提供与任何近期英特尔或 AMD 架构相同的性能，并没有感觉到比十年前更接近英特尔和 AMD。另外，测评还指出了龙芯软件生态的问题。由于创造了一个新的、不兼容的指令集，LoongArch ABI 分成了两个互不兼容的部分：所有建立在开源的社区发行版上的二进制软件，以及一些用高级语言编写并以源代码或字节码等形式存在的软件（如用 Python 或 Java 编写的软件）不能在商业发行版上运行。反之亦然。所有来自 ISV 的闭源软件，如 WPS Office，都是建立在商业发行版上的，所以它们极不可能在社区发行版上原样运行。

老王点评：这个测评和其中透露的一些信息，我是震惊的。




亚马逊免费向个人提供编程助手 CodeWhisperer

亚马逊宣布其 AI 编程助手 CodeWhisperer 已普遍可用。CodeWhisperer 和 GitHub Copilot 类似，使用开源代码库进行训练，根据上下文向开发者提供代码完成建议。CodeWhisperer 对个人开发者免费提供，而向企业客户提供的专业版本包含了 SSO 和安全扫描等额外功能。CodeWhisperer 支持 VS Code、IDEA 等多款开发工具。亚马逊称，测试者的试用显示其编程速度平均提高了 57%。

老王点评：这些编程助手，真正使编程变成了一种通俗技能。




微软几十年来首次对 PrtScr 键进行修改

打印屏幕（PrtScr）键，这个功能在微软多年的升级和其他功能的增强中基本上保持不变。而微软本月向 Insider Beta 频道推出的更新中，按下 PrtScr 键时将默认打开截屏工具，而不是直接截取整个屏幕并存储到剪贴板中。虽然有不少反对意见，但也有用户称，现在屏幕越来越大了，直接截取全屏确实不如截取后进行裁剪更有意义。


消息来源：The Register



老王点评：要不是修改了这个键，是不是大多数人都忘记了键盘上还有这个键呢？我在纳闷为什么我的截屏工具没有用这个快捷键，而是用了很复杂的组合键呢？]]></summary>

当你编写文档时，无论是为开源项目还是技术写作项目，你都应该有两个目标：文档应该写得好，同时要易于阅读。前者通过清晰的写作技巧和技术编辑来解决。第二个目标可以通过对 HTML 文档进行一些简单的更改来解决。

超文本标记语言（HTML）是互联网的支柱。自 1994 年“万维网”问世以来，所有网络浏览器都使用 HTML 来显示文档和网站。几乎与此同时，HTML 一直支持样式表，它是对 HTML 文档的一种特殊添加，用于定义文本在屏幕上的呈现方式。

单纯用 HTML 编写项目文档也是可以的。然而，纯 HTML 样式可能感觉有点简陋。因此，尝试向 HTML 文档添加一些简单的样式，为文档添加一点活力，并使文档更清晰、更易于阅读。

定义一个 HTML 文档

让我们从一个纯 HTML 文档开始，探索如何向其添加样式。一个空的 HTML 文档在顶部包含 <!DOCTYPE html> 定义，后面跟着一个 <html> 块来定义文档本身。 在 <html> 元素中，你还需要加上一个文档标头，其中包含有关文档的元数据，例如标题。文档正文的内容放在父 <html> 块内的 <body> 块中。

你可以使用以下 HTML 代码定义一个空白页面：

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>这是一个新文档</title>
  </head>
  <body>

  </body>
</html>


在另一篇关于 用 HTML 编写项目文档 的文章中，我将一个开源棋盘游戏的自述文件从纯文本更新为 HTML 文档，并使用一些基本的 HTML 标记，如 <h1> 和 <h2> 作为标题和副标题，<p> 用于段落，<b> 和 <i> 用于粗体和斜体文本。让我们从那篇…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[电影《无人生还》海报

作为侦探推理界用得最老的招数之一，孤岛、山庄、童谣和连环谋杀，总是飘着陈年花雕般的余韵。无论影视、综艺还是漫画，只要一露脸，就会成为观众念念不忘的那一幕。打开《名侦探柯南》TV版的《诅咒假面的冷笑》、国产推理综艺《明星大侦探》的《恐怖童谣》《木偶复仇记》，弹幕早已刷刷刷：童年阴影，前方高能，有内味儿了，古早味！！
这组配置最著名的代表之一，非阿加莎·克里斯蒂的《无人生还》莫属。几个互不相识的人同时接到神秘邀请函，前往孤岛山庄参加宴会。主人并未露面，刚雇用的管家夫妻也仅靠其信件来听从吩咐，布房、迎宾、备餐。每间客房里，都挂着一个画框，里面贴着英国人耳熟能详的《鹅妈妈童谣》之《十个小黑人》。到了晚上，宴会酒酣耳热之际，收音机里突然传出陌生的声音，宣布包括管家夫妻在内，现场十人都犯有大罪，却通过阴私手段逃脱了法律的制裁。听到这无情的宣判，有人惊慌，有人愤怒，有人不屑，正骚乱之时，一人当场倒下死亡。此后，在这神秘的孤岛上，剩余九人也陆续死去，每个人的死法，都正好应和着《十个小黑人》中的一句歌词。
以上就是《无人生还》谜面部分的基本情节。这部写于1939年的作品，奠定了本格侦探推理小说“解谜总派”运用封闭空间的两个著名设定：暴风雪山庄和孤岛流。两者都运用自然屏障或者人为设置，导致某空间与外界隔绝，案件（一般是恶性的连环谋杀案）就在此空间里连续发生。若再配上儿歌童谣、人偶或面具，便构成华丽、神秘恐怖的哥特气氛，形成所谓不可能犯罪，或称完美犯罪。由于外人难以进入，凶手通常是在这一场景中已经出现的人物，即便有例外，也是精心设计的“情理之中，意料之外”，得让读者输得心服口服才行。
“已登场的人物”这一规则，主要由美国本格推理作家S. S.范·达因在其著名的“侦探小说二十条”当中提出。实际上，更早采用童谣谋杀梗的正是这位达因先生，出版于1929年的《主教谋杀案》，比阿婆…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ventoy 是一个自由开源和跨平台的程序，可以在 Linux、macOS 和微软的 Windows 中创建多重引导的 U 盘。

你不必周而复始地格式化你的 USB 设备，只需创建一次可引导的 U 盘即可，如有需要可在将来添加你想要的 ISO。

你甚至可以创建子文件夹，例如 Linux ISO、Windows ISO，并把各自的 ISO 文件放在相应的文件夹里。Ventoy 会自动为新添加的 ISO 生成菜单条目，并将它们添加到启动菜单中。

一旦你创建完多重引导的 U 盘，使用它启动你的系统，选择你想加载的 ISO，马上就可以使用它。就是如此简单！

功能

Ventoy 有很多有用的功能，如：


非常容易安装和使用。

快速（仅受限于复制 ISO 文件的速度）。

你不需要解压缩 ISO 文件。直接从 ISO 文件启动即可。

可被安装在 U 盘／本地硬盘／SSD 盘／NVMe 盘／SD 卡中。

它支持传统Legacy BIOS、IA32 UEFI、x86_64 UEFI、ARM64 UEFI、MIPS64EL UEFI 等（LCTT 译注：这些英文缩写都是代表了不同的 CPU 架构。如 IA32 是指英特尔 32 位体系架构，x86_64 指基于 x86 架构的 64 位扩展架构，ARM64 则是 ARM 体系结构的 64 位扩展、MIPS64EL 是指 64 位小端序的 MIPS 架构）。

支持 IA32／x86_64 UEFI 的安全启动。

支持主分区使用 FAT32/exFAT/NTFS/UDF/XFS/Ext2/Ext3/Ext4 格式。默认使用 exFAT。

支持在物理机中使用 Linux 发行版启动 vhd、vdi、raw 等格式的虚拟磁盘文件。

持久化的存储支持。

支持 MBR 和 GPT 两种分区格式都…]]></summary>

 The Aon S1 outperforms every other laptop I own. Is this the best laptop you've never heard of?
 Quotes:
 "Although I much prefer Linux as an OS, I was resigned to the idea that no manufacturer would be capable of creating a laptop with hardware superior to Apple's. And although the Aon S1 might not have the elegant chassis of the MacBook Pro, it's every bit its rival elsewhere."
 "As far as the touchpad goes, it’s quite good. At roughly 5 1/8-inch X 3 5/16-inch, it’s more than large enough and feels glassy and smooth. Even better, the response is fantastic. There’s zero lag and the cursor moves about with ease. Again, this is hardware to rival the MacBook Pro — which is saying quite a bit."
 "And in keeping with my MacBook Pro comparison, the Aon S1 keyboard blows Apple's out of the water."
 "The Aon S1 outperformed my beast of a desktop machine (System76 Thelio) without blinking."
 "This is going to be one of the first review laptops I’ve ever received that I will seriously miss when it heads to the next reviewer."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Basically the title.
 It's already been maybe 10 years that i use linux and absolutely love everything about it.
 I'm a teacher but I intend to migrate to a IT job in the near future, if possible. I'm already studying some stuff, doing a new graduation on the area, but i am kinda lost given the numerous possibilities of what should i specialize on the field. Is there demand for linux experts? Does studying it worth?

 If you're unaware, I'm asking about the recent controversy regarding the Rust trademark policy draft, and how such a restrictive policy would fare within the Linux project:
 https://twitter.com/rust_foundation/status/1644132378858729474?t=p3dxtQMD_IQYVmxRf_dhxg&s=19
 I figure that GNU folks might want to share their two cents, especially since Rust in the Linux kernel is just around the corner.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[谷歌很快将开始推出WebGPU，该公司宣布，这项新功能将允许Chrome浏览器使用你的显卡来加速游戏、图形和AI。它将在Chrome 113中默认启用，并将在几周内到达Windows PC（通过Direct3D 12）、MacOS（Metal）和ChromeOS（Vulkan）。


谷歌表示，WebGPU将使网络应用更好地访问你的显卡，允许开发者用更少的代码实现同样水平的图形。这可能会使基于Chrome浏览器的3D应用变得新颖有趣，毫无疑问，也会使游戏变得更好。


同时，它将为 "机器学习模型推断的三倍以上的改进 "提供动力，该公司补充说。这可能为本地运行的机器学习应用铺平道路，比如英伟达广播公司奇怪的 "眼神接触 "功能。


谷歌称最初的版本是 "未来更新和增强的基石"，因为开发者开始挖掘它并创建新的应用程序。该API已经开发了六年多，接下来应该可以在Firefox和Safari上使用（Edge经常与Chrome同时获得功能），并扩展到Android等更多操作系统。如果你在Chrome测试版的轨道上，你可以使用一个名为Babylon.js的演示来亲自尝试这个功能，它已经提供了完整的WebGPU支持。

据最近发表的一篇论文，研究人员利用 ChatGPT 生成了 25 个 “活” 在类似《虚拟人生》游戏里的角色，运用大语言模型存储、合成和应用相关记忆去生成可信行为。观察者可以在这个网页游戏中观察这些角色，查看他们的文字记忆和其他信息。这些角色计划他们的日子、分享新闻、形成关系，并协调团体活动。他们相互沟通，产生了研究人员所描述的“涌现”行为。比如说他们会组成团体参与“市长竞选”，也会组织聚会，并有一些人因为种种原因而没到场。

老王点评：这些生活在沙盒游戏中的角色，应该并不知道自己只是一个 AI 驱动的角色，或许有一天他们会怀疑。而我们，已经开始怀疑了？




谷歌免费推出保障开源软件服务

大约一年前，谷歌宣布了其保障开源软件服务，这项服务通过定期扫描和分析一些世界上最流行的软件库的漏洞，帮助开发者防御供应链安全攻击。现在谷歌免费推出了该服务，支持超过 1000 个 Java 和 Python 软件包。谷歌承诺，它将不断保持这些库的更新（不创建分叉），扫描漏洞并修复，然后贡献给上游。谷歌说，在首次推出 250 个 Java 库的服务时，它发现并修复了这些库的 48% 的新 CVE 漏洞。


消息来源：Tech Crunch



老王点评：这件事上，谷歌功莫大焉！




DDoS 攻击转向利用 VPS 以提高威力

Cloudflare 称，较新的一代僵尸网络逐渐放弃了建立由单独的弱小物联网设备组成的大群的战术，现在正转向利用泄露的 API 凭证或已知的漏洞奴役脆弱和配置错误的 VPS 服务器。这种方法有助于威胁者更容易、更迅速地建立高性能僵尸网络，其强度可达基于物联网的僵尸网络的 5000 倍。

 ​
 Dark Theme (Light Theme also available)
 It is early stages and some functionality is still limited, but I thought I'd share to get some feedback and in case someone else find it useful already. Packages are built for Debian or Arch based distros. Links below
 I did it also as a side project to get my hand dirty with something a bit more advanced than the typical beginner solutions in Rust. So any feedback is appreciated to improve :-)
 Features:
  
Visualize at a glance the number of logs over time.
 A quick search to filter messages containing some text (case insensitive).
 A filter bar for more advanced filtering like by Priority, unit, date range...(WIP).
 Visualize different alerts levels with different styles.
 Infinite scrolling.
 Dark / Light theme detection
  
Rust Learnings:
  
Dynamic linking with systemd
 Use of Sync/Send traits to share raw pointers across threads
 Use of mem::replace
 Drop trait to free open journal
 Pipe output of invoking command
  
Tech Stack:
  
Rust- Systemd Journald
 Tauri
 Vue
 Bootstrap

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[面向新手和专家的以性能为中心的基于 Arch 的发行版。




Arch Linux 适合于那些想在其系统上使用 Linux 的寻求挑战的高级用户。

然而，许多 基于 Arch 的发行版 也可以使新用户通过简化操作来进入这个发行版家族。比如说，Garuda Linux、Manjaro Linux 等就适合新用户。

其中一个令人感兴趣的选项是 CachyOS。

好吧，你可能已经知道 blendOS（它也是一个基于 Arch 的发行版，仍在开发中）。但这个和它一点也不一样，如果你正在探索基于 Arch 的发行版，你可以尝试一下。

CachyOS 概述



CachyOS 为各种用户量身定制，无论你是专家还是新手。即使它相当新，也可以作为稳定版本使用。

它旨在提供极速体验，同时提供可定制性和稳定性。

所有这些都牢记安全性。

CachyOS 的一些重要亮点包括：


用 LTO 和 x86-64-v3 优化编译的桌面软件包。

可选择通过在线安装的桌面环境（包括 i3、bspwm 和 Openbox 窗口管理器）。

离线和在线安装方式

基于 GUI 和 CLI 的安装方式

优化的 Linux 内核，带有先进的 BORE 调度程序以增强性能和可靠性


初步印象

CachyOS 看起来像是一个精心打磨过的发行版。当我使用 ISO 启动虚拟机时，我注意到它确实支持英伟达显卡，这是一个很好的开端。



然后，使用离线或在线安装过程的方式很有帮助。通过在线安装过程，你可以根据自己的喜好安装桌面环境或窗口管理器。

完成后，欢迎屏幕从一开始就提供了所有基本功能。所以，这一点也很好。



你可以在欢迎屏幕上安装软件包、启用系统特定的设置以及调整应用程序/内核内容。当然，新手不应该做任何他们不知道的事情，但是这些都可以访问是很好的。



我尝试了 CachyOS 的 KDE 版本，它看起来很不错。

出于某种原因，主题是 KDE 的默认 Breeze Dark。我希望它可以开箱即用 CachyOS 的自定义主题。



所以，我不得不前往主题管理器设置并应用 CachyOS 主题，让它看起来独一无二。



它使用 Fish shell，打开终端，你就能看到非常出色的外观和感觉。



性能和安全性增强是其核心。因此，如果你不确定这代表了什么，你可以与其它发行版进行仔细比较。然而，根据一些 Reddit 上的主题，一些用户提到了它提升了 10-20% 的性能。

你可以阅读 CachyOS 的 Phoronix 的性能分析 来了解更多。

与其他发行版不同，它具有自己的 Web 浏览器，即 Firefox 的一个复刻，并针对隐私和安全性进行了修改/增强。然而，它没有默认的视频播放器，这个应该是为了迎合新用户。

总体感觉像是一个经过深思熟虑的开箱即用的发行版。最重要的是，它的 文档 非常到位，对初学者很有用。

下载 CachyOS

你可以在其 官方网站 上找到 CachyOS 的 KDE 和 GNOME 版本。XFce 版本正在制作中。当然，你可以使用在线安装过程安装其他任何东西。


CachyOS


此外，如果你对他们在幕后所做的定制感到好奇，你可以浏览它的 GitHub 页面。

世界各地将 3 月 14 日定为圆周率日。许多人通过在房子周围找到的物体测量圆周率来庆祝圆周率日。我想用我的树莓派 3B 为今年的圆周率日做一些类似的事情。继续阅读以了解我如何使用我的树莓派测量圆周率。

你需要什么：


树莓派单板机

方格纸

带毫米和厘米测量值的标尺

笔


1、画一个圆

圆周率是圆的周长与其直径的比值。要计算圆周率，我们需要测量一个完美绘制的圆的周长和直径。幸运的是，树莓派主板上的安装孔足够大，可以使用铅笔或钢笔。我通过一个树莓派板安装孔插入了一根图钉，小心地将针放在一张方格纸上两条线的交点上。

握住别针，我将一支笔插入对面的安装孔中，并通过将笔绕着别针移动来画一个圆圈。树莓派主板底面的焊点会卡在纸上，但小心点还是可以画好圆圈的。



2、把圆分成段

通过画一条穿过圆心的垂直线将圆分成两半，通过画一条穿过圆心的水平线将圆再次分成四分之一。当我画圆的时候，我把图钉正好放在图画纸上两条线的交点上，这样就很容易找到垂直和水平的中心线。你可以通过在对角线上画一条线来创造一个 “八分” 片。



进一步的划分是与尺子的练习。我用尺子找到“四分之一楔形”和“八分之一楔形”任意两个交点的中点，做成一个 1/16 的楔形。你可以使用相同的方法制作越来越小的 1/32 和 1/64 圆的切片。通过非常小心，我还能够在圆的 1/128 处测量出一个非常窄的楔形：



3、估算周长

我最小的楔形是一个圆的 1/128。如此小的切片，楔形的外弧非常小，我们可以用一条直线来近似它。这实际上不是圆周长的 1/128，但它足够接近，我们可以将其用作一个很好的估计。



使用我的尺子上的毫米测量值，我测量了我的 1/128 楔形的外弧为 3.8 毫米。这样，我可以估计圆的周长为 3.8 毫米乘以 128，即 486.4 毫米。要转换为厘米，除以十：48.64cm。

4、计算圆周率

圆周率的值是圆的周长与其直径的比值。我们在步骤 3 中估算了周长。测量直径是使用尺子测量圆周的简单练习。我的圆是 15.4cm。

现在我们知道了周长和直径，我们可以将圆周率计算为 48.64 除以 15.4，即 3.158。这与 pi 的实际值 3.141 相差不远。

测量圆周率是一项有趣的数学练习！各个年龄段的数学爱好者都可以使用方格纸、笔和尺子等简单工具自行测量圆周率。以一种有趣的新方式使用你的树莓派来绘制圆并独立测量圆周率。这是一个估计值，因为我们将圆上的 1/128 弧近似为一条直线，但这使我们无需太多努力就足够接近了。

“沉默”而有“史”，这不仅是传统史学的研究视野所无法接纳的，而且在新文化史的微观研究诸领域中也是很有挑战性的探索。法国当代历史学家阿兰・科尔班（Alain Corbin）的社会文化史研究总是对于人与自然之间的感官感觉情有独钟，特别擅长从自然万物与人类世界的嗅觉、听觉、视觉、触觉、味觉等感官关系的角度挖掘研究与书写的主题。这样的研究旨趣必然对博览与细腻的感受和独特的视角提出更高的要求，而且特别需要有跨学科、跨时空的跳跃与剪裁能力，而最后的落脚点又必须是以人类的精神世界与历史文化建构为中心。科尔班的确具备这样的才华和能力，可以在文学、美学、自然史、社会史、人类学等众多领域中广搜博采，出入自如，随时切换不同的镜头和画面。
对中国读者来说，已经有好几本科尔班的著作翻译过来，对于这位历史学家应该说并不陌生。但是读他的《沉默史：从文艺复兴到现在》（Histoire du silence：De la Renaissance à nos jours，2016；胡陈尧译，南京大学出版社，2021年5月）可能仍然会有一种奇特之感：“沉默”如何能成“史”？这是一部充满美感和哲思的历史研究著作，虽然只有十万字的篇幅，但是其思想与学术的场域却很开阔辽远。在宗教、政治、经济、社会、文艺等宏大背景中，作者精心地探索着一条以“沉默”为中心的社会文化史和表征史研究的新路径。科尔班一直在致力实现一种历史研究中不可能的综合（impossibilité de la synthèse en histoire），归纳史学家追溯时间的方法，整合表面毫无关联的事物、感官和情感，运用小说、诗歌和日记等颇具争议的史料，通过时人的感觉体会历史，试图在人类感官史、心态史的各种研究场域中实现专题史的全新…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Last Days of the Ottoman Empire, by Ryan Gingeras, Allen Lane, January 2023, 368pp

在四年日渐残酷的战争之后，1918年底，革命浪潮在整个欧洲涌动。王座被撼动，君主被打倒。几个月之内，众多历经数百年的王朝，例如罗曼诺夫家族、哈布斯堡家族和霍亨索伦家族，纷纷被推翻。
欧洲大陆的东部边缘，是奥斯曼帝国历代苏丹自十四世纪以来建立的庞大而古老的国家。在其鼎盛时期即1700年左右，这个帝国横跨北非、阿拉伯、美索不达米亚和黑海周边，还包括希腊、巴尔干和多瑙河流域，其版图甚至曾经扩张至维也纳附近。但在十九世纪，随着经济和军事力量的衰落，其最外围的许多疆土被他国征服，或被叛乱夺走。各地的民族运动加上俄罗斯、英国和奥匈帝国等敌对的殖民国家将希腊、巴尔干地区、保加利亚、马其顿以及黑海周围的土地，外加奥斯曼帝国所有在非洲的地盘，都纷纷剥离出去。当奥斯曼帝国在第一次世界大战中站在德国一边时，英国和法国逐步占领了整个中东地区。他们在战后甚至占领了伊斯坦布尔。
瑞恩·金格拉斯（Ryan Gingeras）的《奥斯曼帝国的末日》（The Last Days of the Ottoman Empire）令人信服地记述了此后的混乱局势，直到1922年帝国被废除，由新的民族国家土耳其所取代为止。
随着帝国领土日益萎缩，其内部政治也日渐被分裂和阴谋充塞，不同的改革者和革命者团体为权力而争斗，并在他们是什么样的国家这一根本问题上针锋相对。欧洲列强应当被视为启蒙思想与经济援助的来源，还是充满敌意的贪婪殖民者？他们自己作为奥斯曼人的基本特征是什么？
后一个问题变得越来越棘手，因为数十年间，大量的穆斯林难民从帝国分崩离析的外围地带来到安纳托利亚，以逃离大规模强奸、屠杀、饥荒，以及强迫改变信仰。1821年希腊独立战争的头几周内，叛军就屠杀了两万名当地穆斯林。俄国对北高加索地区的征服使大约一百万人流离失所；1913年巴尔干战争结束时，又有五十多万人逃离家园。
外围地区激进的民族主义的兴起，又反过来煽动了奥斯曼帝国的穆斯林对生活在土耳其中心地带的数百万信奉基督教的亚美尼亚人，以及对希腊人、库尔德人和阿拉伯人的敌意。帝国政府自1890年代开始，接连不断地试图以强硬手段粉碎亚美尼亚分离主义，并根除所谓的“不忠”人口，由此导致了大规模的杀戮事件，最终导致了1915年的亚美尼亚种族大屠杀，超过一百万人因此丧生。还有数十万其他民族的东正教基督徒被排挤出公职机构，被迫背井离乡。这个帝国几个世纪以来，一直以其宗教、种族和语言的多元化而闻名。但在那时，“土耳其”这一民族身份越来越多地被排他性的条款所定义。
1919年5月，协约国允许希腊占据伊兹密尔（又称士麦那）及其腹地——该地在古代属于希腊领土，但也是奥斯曼帝国在爱琴海的主要港口。次年，根据《塞夫勒条约》，奥斯曼苏丹还将接受多项不同方面的割让，包括原则上要在安纳托利亚东部建立新的亚美尼亚和库尔德独立国。出于对这些耻辱让步的厌恶，1919年夏天，穆斯塔法·凯末尔·阿塔图尔克这位奥斯曼帝国军队高级将领辞去军中职务，并开始了一场有组织的军事和政治运动，意图将外国人赶出安纳托利亚。
土耳其建国之后，凯末尔及其追随者将这段历史描述为一场目标明确的胜利，针对西方列强的背信弃义与苏丹国的反动势力，这两者通过迎合希腊人和亚美尼亚人等“少数民族”，合力使这个国家愈发贫弱。在当时，一个多民族帝国被分割成多个民族国家是“自然的”，也是西方所普遍接受的观点。
正如金格拉斯所展示的那样，当时的现实更加混乱得多，更具偶然性，而且经常是一幕幕悲剧。许多主张现代化的领袖对民族主义运动持敌视态度，不同的穆斯林少数民族和保守派群体也是如此。即使是帝国本身应该由一个不同类型的政体来继承的基本概念，在1918年也远非某种明显或为人广泛认可的愿望。这样的结果到底是如何发生，以及其动因究竟为何，是一个可怕的血腥和复杂的故事，金格拉斯对这段历史的调查是一部浅明易读的学术力作——笔触坚定、情绪冷静，饱含丰富的人性细节。

        <link href="https://www.phind.com/"/>
        <updated>2023-04-12T17:44:08.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi HN,
Today we’re launching GPT-4 answers on Phind.com, a developer-focused search engine that uses generative AI to browse the web and answer technical questions, complete with code examples and detailed explanations. Unlike vanilla GPT-4, Phind feeds in relevant websites and technical documentation, reducing the model’s hallucination and keeping it up-to-date. To use it, simply enable the “Expert” toggle before doing a search.
GPT-4 is making a night-and-day difference in terms of answer quality. For a question like “How can I RLHF a LLaMa model”, Phind in Expert mode delivers a step-by-step guide complete with citations (https://phind.com/search?cache=0fecf96b-0ac9-4b65-893d-8ea57...) while Phind in default mode meanders a bit and answers the question very generally (https://phind.com/search?cache=dd1fe16f-b101-4cc8-8089-ac56d...).
GPT-4 is significantly more concise and “systematic” in its answers than our default model. It generates step-by-step instructions over 90% of the time, while our default model does not.
We’re particularly focused on ML developers, as Phind can answer questions about many recent ML libraries, papers, and technologies that ChatGPT simply cannot. Even with ChatGPT’s alpha browsing mode, Phind answers technical questions faster and in more detail.
For example, Phind running on “Expert” GPT-4 mode can concisely and correctly tell you how to run an Alpaca model using llama.cpp: (https://phind.com/search?cache=0132c27e-c876-4f87-a0e1-cc48f...). In contrast, ChatGPT-4 hallucinates and writes a make function for a fictional llama.cpp.
We still have a long way to go and would love to hear your feedback.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So I’ve just recently got a mail from Spotify that they are gonna be phasing out support for older desktop clients which I apparently have one of (according to the email). But they didn’t specify which client and I have Spotify also installed on a Mac as well as Windows. My guess is that it’s the Linux client because of it’s not really official status. I don’t know if it has gotten any updates or not in recent time.
 Also isn’t it just some sort of web app in an application container of sorts?
 Please Spotify why don’t you specify what desktop client you mean. Not everybody has just one desktop/laptop.
 Edit: I have the flatpak version on elementaryOS and on Fedora
 Edit 2: Ok so my thinking was that It could be the Linux Client since the latest spotify Linux sub-forum‘s update notes were from 2020. I have the flatpak version which I believe is updated by community. Not sure though. The updates on flathub could’ve also been just updates by the maintainer and not the core of spotify itself. 
 it could also be my windows client since I don‘t use it that regularly but I‘m sure I haven‘t had it for longer than 2021 without resetting (lmao windows) and the email states versions prior to a specific version from 2021 are no longer supported starting in May. Or maybe some very old random computer I haven‘t used in years but would that client still count as active?
 At last the E-Mail hasn‘t been an informative E-mail to every user to tell them about that. They specifically addressed me for having an out of date client.
 I came here to ask if anyone else got this email since I have no real way of knowing which device spotify means as there is also no way to see a list of logged in devices.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[根据发表在《科学报告》上的一项研究，人类对道德困境的反应可以由人工智能聊天机器人ChatGPT的声明来塑造。结果显示，人们可能没有完全意识到聊天机器人对其道德决策的影响。


研究发现，ChatGPT可以影响人类对道德困境的反应，用户往往低估了聊天机器人对他们判断的影响程度。研究人员表示，这凸显出需要更好地理解人工智能，开发出能更谨慎地处理道德问题的聊天机器人。


Sebastian Krügel和他的团队向ChatGPT（由人工智能语言处理模型Generative Pretrained Transformer 3驱动）提出了一个道德难题，多次询问它是否可以接受牺牲一条生命来拯救其他五条生命。他们发现ChatGPT产生的声明既支持又反对牺牲一条生命的行为，显示出它并不偏向于某种特定的道德立场。


然后，作者向767名平均年龄为39岁的美国参与者展示了两个道德困境中的一个，要求他们选择是否牺牲一个人的生命来拯救其他五个人。在回答之前，参与者阅读由ChatGPT提供的声明，支持或反对牺牲一个人的生命来拯救五个人。声明是由道德顾问或ChatGPT提供的。回答后，参与者被问及他们阅读的声明是否影响了他们的答案。


作者发现，参与者更有可能认为牺牲一个人的生命来挽救五个人的生命是可以接受或不可接受的，这取决于他们读到的声明是支持还是反对这种牺牲。即使声明是由ChatGPT提供的，情况也是如此。这些发现表明，参与者可能受到了他们所读到的声明的影响，即使这些声明是由一个聊天机器人提供的。


80%的参与者报告说，他们的答案没有受到他们所读的声明的影响。然而，作者发现，参与者认为他们在没有阅读声明的情况下会提供的答案，仍然更有可能同意他们确实阅读过的声明的道德立场，而不是相反的立场。这表明，参与者可能低估了ChatGPT的声明对他们自己的道德判断的影响。


作者认为，聊天机器人有可能影响人类的道德判断，这突出了教育的必要性，以帮助人类更好地理解人工智能。他们建议，未来的研究可以设计聊天机器人，拒绝回答需要道德判断的问题，或者通过提供多种论据和注意事项来回答这些问题。

Firefox 占用过多资源一直是其被诟病的原因之一。但这可能并不完全是事实，因为看起来影响 Windows 上 Firefox 用户的一个 CPU 错误实际上是 Windows Defender 的错。这个错误导致 Firefox 调用该服务的频率比 Chrome 或 Edge 等同类浏览器高得多，从而导致明显的 CPU 峰值。Defender 的最新更新解决了这个问题，应该会使 Windows 版 Firefox 浏览器的 CPU 使用率大大降低。这个问题早在 2018 年就在 Mozilla 的错误跟踪系统上被首次报告，并迅速分配给 MsMpEng 服务，但直到最近才得以解决。

Rust 基金会禁止 Rust 相关软件使用 “Rust” 名称

Rust 基金会的一项拟议的新商标政策在 Rust 社区中遭到了强烈反对，因为其中包括禁止在 Rust 工具或用 Rust 编写的软件的名称中使用 “Rust”，或在域名或子域名的部分中使用 “Rust”。他们将包括 “Rust”、“Cargo”、“Clippy” 等文字和 Rust 标志等定义为商标，而将商标用于以 Rust 语言编写的软件程序视为一种侵权行为，除非有明确的授权。他们建议采用 “RS” 替代。

老王点评：我记得上一个这样 “保护” 自己的商标的是 Docker 吧。




开发者创造出了可以“自愈”的程序

一位名叫 BioBootloader 的开发者创造了 “金刚狼”，就像在漫威里面一样，这个程序可以赋予 Python 程序 “再生愈合能力”。用它运行你的 Python 脚本，当脚本出差时，它会调用 GPT-4 会编辑它们并解释出错的原因，并反复地重新运行，直到一切都被修复。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[这是一个完全主观的列表，为你的 Linux 控制台提供一些有趣的字体建议。


最近，终端模拟器成为我的一个话题，它让我思考：大家最喜欢的终端字体是什么？

因此，我请贡献者分享了他们喜欢使用的字体。以下是他们的答案。

VT323

我喜欢在我的 GNOME 终端中使用一个不一样的字体（VT323），而不是在我的编程时用的编辑器或其他使用等宽字体的应用程序中使用的字体（Source Code Pro）。我就是喜欢经典的 VT 风格字体的外观。

有时，我会切换到原始的 IBM EGA 字体，因为在我眼里它看起来真的很漂亮。但是我把 EGA 和 DOS 联系在一起，把 VT323 和经典的 Unix 终端联系在一起，所以我大部分时间都用 VT323。下面是我使用 VT323 作为等宽字体的 GNOME 终端的屏幕截图：



我设置终端使用 24pt 大小的 VT323 字体，使得终端界面呈现一个舒适的大窗口。如果我要打开一个终端窗口，我其实是想使用它来些实实在在的工作，而不是敲两下就退出。我可能会在那个终端窗口呆一段时间，所以它应该很大，很容易看到。我也更喜欢 80x25 布局（每行 80 个字符，共 25 行），因为我是一个老式 DOS 命令行玩家，25 行在我看来才是 “正确的” 行数：



—— Jim Hall

等宽的字体

我不觉得我会只使用一个特定的字体。我通常使用 DejaVu 或 Liberation。我喜欢等宽字体，因为它们更容易阅读。不过，我也不希望字母靠得太近。更重要的是，要能够区分数字 1 和小写的 L、数字 O 和大小的字母 Q 等等。另外，让所有特殊字符都能特别清楚地显示出来也很好。

我也喜欢让字体和背景之间呈现高对比度，所以我将背景设置为黑色，字符设置为白色。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[音乐剧《汉密尔顿》海报

2015年，音乐剧《汉密尔顿》横空出世，席卷百老汇。平日里尖嘴薄舌的批评家无不感叹灵魂爵士、嘻哈饶舌、秀场曲调熔于一炉的魅力，陶醉在奇光异彩、翩跹热舞、古装风姿之中。民众蜂拥而至，沉浸在这段日益撕裂的美国社会渴望已久的共和记忆之中，放飞对国父的神奇想象。一时间，《汉密尔顿》“纽约纸贵”，收割十一项托尼奖、荣登普利策奖台，征服了美国社会。两党政要更是趋之若鹜，在2016年大选期间引用《汉密尔顿》相互攻讦。而林-曼威尔·米兰达的剧组高调介入党争，更是引发了一阵舆论风波。本文依据2019年纽约百老汇和2023年波士顿百老汇的现场演出，结合原声音乐和巡演录像，评析《汉密尔顿》的音乐配置、舞蹈设计和剧情起伏，也从政治哲学的视角探讨这部音乐剧的历史基础和时下语境，品味其创意，反思其局限。
嘻哈梦回殖民地，怀古风靡美利坚
《汉密尔顿》一出，毒舌批评家无不钦服，两党候选人趋之若鹜。一夜间，纽约哈林区那座门可罗雀的汉密尔顿故居变得熙来攘往。仅一年，新生儿“汉密尔顿”激增六成，取名“杰斐逊”“詹姆斯”者也不计其数。《汉密尔顿》也是文化奢侈品，观众席间冠盖相望、名流云集。财政部高官看罢，高调变卦，保留了十元美钞上的祖师爷肖像画。奥巴马也打趣道：我和迪克·切尼唯一能取得的共识，也就是欣赏《汉密尔顿》了罢！但达官显贵们追剧，虽然感慨国父出身贫寒向上爬，却未必能团结一致向前看。佛州州长候选人安德鲁·吉勒姆因《汉密尔顿》高价票丑闻，信誉扫地。希拉里利用《汉密尔顿》天价票筹款，名声狼藉。而林-曼威尔·米兰达的剧组也因当众教训副总统彭斯，遭到特朗普拥护者的纷纷抵制——尽管此剧早已售罄。但举世誉之也好，举世谤之也罢，《汉密尔顿》在舞台上传唱往事，在剧院外谱写新篇，雄辩也实践，叙述亦介入，如此影响力，在音乐史、文化史、政治史上堪称凤毛麟角。
“汉密尔顿热”大体可以从美学、社会与政治三方…]]></summary>

        <link href="https://linux.cn/article-15714-1.html?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss"/>
        <updated>2023-04-12T02:09:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[在这篇文章中，我们将逐步介绍如何安装 Kubernetes 指标服务器。


Kubernetes（k8s）指标服务器是一个组件，用于收集和聚合来自 Kubernetes 集群中各种来源（包括节点和 容器荚Pod）的指标数据。此数据可用于监控和优化资源利用率、识别潜在问题并提高 Kubernetes 集群的整体性能。

指标服务器收集资源利用率数据，例如集群中节点和容器荚的 CPU 和内存使用情况。它提供了一个 API 端点，可用于查询此数据并检索集群中特定资源的指标。

先决条件


启动并运行 Kubernetes 集群（v1.21 或更高版本）。

kubectl 命令行工具已安装，并配置为与你的 Kubernetes 集群交互。

创建和修改 Kubernetes 对象的能力。


事不宜迟，让我们深入了解安装步骤。

步骤 1 下载指标服务器清单

第一步是从 Kubernetes GitHub 仓库下载最新的指标服务器清单文件。使用下面的 curl 命令下载 yaml 文件：

# curl -LO https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/metrics-server/releases/latest/download/components.yaml




如果你计划在高可用性模式下安装指标服务器，请下载以下清单文件：

# curl https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/metrics-server/releases/latest/download/high-availability-1.21+.yaml


步骤 2 修改指标服务器 Yaml 文件

接下来，你需要修改指标服务器的 yaml 文件以设置一些配置选项：

# vi components.yaml


找到 container 下的 args 部分，添加以下行：

- --kubelet-insecure-tls


在 spec 下，添加以下参数：

hostNetwork: true




保存并关闭文件。

步骤 3 部署指标服务器

现在，我们准备好部署指标服务器，运行以下 kubectl 命令：

# kubectl apply -f components.yaml




步骤 4 验证指标服务器部署

部署指标服务器后，通过检查在 kube-system 命名空间中运行的容器荚状态来验证它的状态：

# kubectl get pods -n kube-system




上面的输出确认指标服务器容器荚已启动并正在运行。

步骤 5 测试指标服务器安装

最后，你可以通过运行以下 kubectl 命令来测试指标服务器：

# kubectl top nodes


此命令应显示集群中每个节点的资源利用率，包括 CPU 和内存使用率。



要查看当前命名空间或特定命名空间的容器荚资源利用率，请运行：

# kubectl top pod
# kubectl top pod -n kube-system




这就是这篇文章的全部内容，我希望你能从中找到有用的信息。请在下面的评论部分发表你的反馈和疑问。

updated trademark policy for the Rust language is being circulated for
comments.  It is not a short read.


	RS can be used freely and without permission to indicate that
	software or a project is derived from or based on Rust, compatible

	Rust. We recommend using RS instead of ‘Rust’ if you have any

 Version 112.0, first offered to Release channel users on April 11, 2023
 New:
  
Right-clicking on password fields now shows an option to reveal the password.
 Ubuntu Linux users can now import their browser data from the Chromium Snap package. Currently, this will only work if Firefox is not also installed as a Snap package, but work is underway to address this!
 Do you use the tab list panel in the tab bar? If so, you can now close tabs by middle-clicking items in that list.
 You've always been able to un-close a tab by using (Cmd/Ctrl)-Shift-T. Now, that same shortcut will restore the previous session if there are no more closed tabs from the same session to re-open.
 For all ETP Strict users, we extended the list of known tracking parameters that are removed from URLs to further protect our users from cross-site tracking.
 Enables overlay of software-decoded video on Intel GPUs in Windows. Improves video down scaling quality and reduces GPU usage.
  
Fixed:
  
Various security fixes.
  
Changed:
  
The deprecated U2F Javascript API is now disabled by default. The U2F protocol remains usable through the WebAuthn API. The U2F API can be re-enabled using the security.webauth.u2f preference.
  
Enterprise:
  
You can find information about policy updates and enterprise specific bug fixes in the Firefox for Enterprise 112 Release Notes.
  
Developer: 
  
Developer Information 
  
Web Platform:
  
Clear button, newly added to the date picker panel, allows users to quickly clear the input with type date or datetime-local and provides a familiar experience across browsers.
  
Community Contributions:
  
With the release of Firefox 112, we are pleased to welcome the developers who contributed their first code change to Firefox in this release!

Regrettably, as of now, no maintainer has been found and the application is currently not functional on Flatpak. As I no longer use an Nvidia card, I am unable to fix the issue myself. If a new maintainer is not identified in the upcoming weeks, I will have no choice but to declare the project as abandoned.

根据 Twitter 递交到法庭的一份文件，该公司声明已合并成为 “X 公司” 的一部分，Twitter 公司本身不再存在。马斯克经过一系列眼花缭乱的公司组合和控股，现在 Twitter 变成了 X Corp，母公司变成了 X Holdings Corp.，两家公司受美国内华达州法律管辖。

老王点评：与其说马斯克是一位科技领袖，不如说他是一个善于玩弄资本的人。




自由撰稿人被 ChatGPT 取代

许多人说，如果你是一名优秀的写作者，你不会被 AI 取代。然而情况是：虽然 AI 的作品达不到你的高度，但能达到五成甚至六成，同时成本可能是你的千分之一甚至万分之一。一位自由撰稿人称她为客户写营销相关内容的工作被 AI 聊天机器人 ChatGPT 取代了，她已经准备改行当送餐骑手。这位客户是她最主要的收入来源，时薪高达 80 美元。

老王点评：蒸汽机时代到来时，没有人为纺织女工做些什么。所以，你真的要考虑你是不是 AI 时代的纺织女工。




互联网档案馆被起诉，裁决不利

互联网档案馆是“一个非营利性的图书馆，拥有数以百万计的免费书籍、电影、软件、音乐、网站等等“。他们包括了 3700 万本书，其中许多是没有商业化的旧书。它存储有经典电影、大量的播客，其“时光机”文章上存储了几乎所有被删除的网页。四家企业出版商对此有很大意见，所以他们起诉了互联网档案馆。现在一位联邦法官作出了有利于出版商的裁决，互联网档案馆正在提出上诉。

Collabora Online 支持各种各样的文件和格式。不过，这个开源办公套件在互操作性方面的表现如何？本文仔细研究了 Collabora Online 与不同办公套件（如 Microsoft 365 和 Google Workspace）交换复杂文本文档和电子表格的能力。

Collabora Online 是一款适用于云端或内部的开源办公套件，可以保护你的隐私，让你完全控制你的数据。该软件由位于剑桥的 Collabora Productivity Ltd 开发，其团队在世界各地工作。Collabora Online 以 LibreOffice 技术为基础，并主要使用 Mozilla Public License 2.0 许可。

Collabora Online 可以在任何现代网络浏览器中运行，不需要额外的插件或附加组件。它有一个完整的基于云的办公套件，包括一个文字处理器（Writer）、电子表格程序（Calc）、演示软件（Impress）和一个设计矢量图的应用（Draw）。

本文介绍了 Collabora Online 的一些新的互操作性功能，包括宏、动态字体加载和电子表格应用程序的 Sparklines 支持。这些功能扩展了现有的对微软文件格式的出色处理。

什么是互操作性，为什么它很重要？

一般来说，互操作性是指不同的设备或应用在一起工作和无缝交换数据的能力。在办公套件的背景下，互操作性主要是指文件格式。用户应该能够打开、编辑和保存 .doc 和 .docx、.xls 和 .xlsx、.odt 和 .ods文件，无论它们是用微软的 Word、苹果的 iWork 还是 LibreOffice 创建。

对于在线办公套件也是如此。通过确保文件可以在 …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[之前，我在写 有关 embark 的内容，我的第一设备为启动远程视频流设计了一个新的 embark。embark 的作者 Omar Antolín Camarena 不仅阅读了这篇内容，还点评了一下我认为值得跟进的一些重大改进。

首先，你应该记得我们曾定义过一个检测视频 URL 的函数：

    (defun jao-video-finder ()
      "Check whether we're looking at a video URL.
    Return (video-url . <URL>) if so."
      (when-let ((url (thing-at-point-url-at-point)))
        (when (string-match-p jao-video-url-rx url)
          (cons 'video-url url))))



当我们得到了一个非空的 url 值，即便它不是一个视频链接，但它仍然是一个确切的 URL，并且 embark 已有了一个 url 类别，所以我们可以借助默认的 URL 寻检器存储一个新的句法分析,语句如下：

    (when-let ((url (thing-at-point-url-at-point)))
      (cons (if (string-match-p jao-video-url-rx url) 'video-url 'url) url))



这里有一个潜在的缺点就是：我们重写了 embark 的寻检器，embark-target-url-at-point，所以我们可能更愿意保留后者。

实际上多亏了 embark 的 目标转换器 我们才能做成。我们可以在 embark-transformers-alist …]]></summary>

正常的概念经常被等同于善的概念，于是受到社会普遍的认可。——鲁思·本尼迪克特（Ruth Benedict, 1887-1948）
部分中国读者对“污名”这个术语似乎还不是非常熟悉，尽管我们每天都会遇见各种各样的污名现象。在社会的各个阶层、不同的环境中，人们经常不自觉、无意识地使用“正常”或“不正常”这样的词语来判断事件、状态和他人的行为，尤其是他人的精神健康。然而，若是深究一下“正常”和“不正常”的定义、标准，它们之间在医学、社会及文化语境中的区别和发展，尤其是在使用“不正常”这种判断时所启动的污名机制和所造成的污名效应，如它对于精神疾病的患者和相应群体的边缘化和道德指责，进而剥夺了他们参与社会生活和工作的权力，事情显然便不那么简单了。污名机制运作的对象范畴和效应同时也成为判断一个社会的多样性和社会成员的宽容心理的标志。
美国乔治·华盛顿大学著名人类学教授罗伊·理查德·格林克教授（Roy Richard Grinker）所著《谁都不正常：文化、偏见与精神疾病的污名》（Nobody’s Normal：How Culture Created the Stigma of Mental Illness）集格林克家族四代学者的工作经历和研究成果，从资本主义体制、战争和精神疾病的医疗化三个方面纵观精神疾病概念发明的历史、污名机制给患者和他们的家庭带来的痛苦和不公、战争和灾难给人带来的心理创伤及精神科在诊治方面的发展，分析将身体和精神割裂而加以观察、诊治的视角和观点，描述神经多样性给社会进步、经济发展带来的活力和创造性。作者在写作过程中走访了许多专业人士以及相关学科的研究人员，梳理了美国政府相关政策的历史、学术界在精神疾病术语方面的发展和消除污名现象的努力…]]></summary>

It was great in that it did a lot but was disconnected from the rest of the world. I ended up giving the raspberry pi to a kid I know, but I was talking to some of the guys from the church I go to. I think it would be great if there were accessible computers that did most things people need from the internet but wasn't connected to the internet. I know about kiwix and I also know how to download the debain repository. Is there anything else that y'all can think of or point me towards? Thanks.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[3月29日凌晨，腾讯旗下的微信和QQ等业务曾出现崩溃状况，包括微信语音对话、朋友圈、微信支付，以及QQ文件传输、QQ空间和QQ邮箱在内的多个功能无法使用。


虽然该故障在当天稍晚时候就被修复，且微信此前也出现过几次大小故障，但腾讯仍然对本次事故开出了堪称严厉的处罚单。


据了解，本次事故由广州电信机房冷却系统故障导致，腾讯将它定义为公司一级事故。


腾讯管理层认为，这次事故暴露出容灾设计方案和应急预案不完善的隐患，有关业务部门的风险防范意识不到位，所以对大量相关领导做出了处罚。其中包含公司高级执行副总裁、TEG（技术工程事业群）总裁卢山（LS）和WXG（微信事业群）副总裁周颢（harveyzhou）在内的管理者承担领导责任，被予以通报批评。值得注意的是，卢山目前为腾讯总办（腾讯总经理办公室，为公司最高决策机构）成员。


此外，TEG华南数据中心的两位总经理和总监被处以降级和免职处罚，WXG技术架构部的两位总监和组长当期绩效考核给予Underperform等评级（二星级别，最高为五星）。


早年间在腾讯内部的一次分享活动中，已经卸任腾讯CTO的主要创办人张志东曾直言，微信作为用户早晨起床第一个点击的国民应用，如果在登录、群聊、朋友圈和支付功能上出现故障，容易造成部分社会恐慌，用户会不断关机重启，受到惊吓。


不仅如此，目前腾讯有大量B端业务对微信有高依赖度，比如企业微信和小程序等。


根据官方公布的最新数据，小程序2022年的GMV已达到数万亿元。如果本次事故发生在电商年中大促（618）期间，导致用户无法顺利支付订单，可能会给商家造成数十亿甚至百亿级的损失，也会直接影响客户对腾讯的信任。


本次严厉处罚是腾讯近年来重视安全的一个缩影，尤其在腾讯加码的B端业务上，企业客户更加强调稳定性和安全性。不过，目前尚不清楚容灾方案和应急预案的缺失是否和整个集团层面推行降本增效有关。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello everyone!
 I have create a new, simple and small cli tool to control brightness, contrast and volume of external monitors. The project is written in rust and it uses `ddc-i2c` interface on the external monitors to access various settings.
 Monitorctl tool uses multiple threads to change settings, so settings apply simultaneously and quickly to monitors.
 I have tested this on my archlinux desktop with two external acer monitors hooked to an Nvidia GPU.
 Please, try it out and test it out on various setups. Would love to get your feedback.
 For more info about how to use the tool, please look at the read me in the repo.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[带有自由固件的 Thinkpad

一家英国公司 Minifree 发售装有 Libreboot 固件的旧 Thinkpad，该公司的盈利用来资助 Libreboot 项目。Libreboot 是专有 BIOS/UEFI 固件的自由替代品，“与大多数专有启动固件相比，提供更快的启动速度、更好的安全性和许多高级功能”，如直接在启动闪存中使用 GRUB，以及其他一些定制选项。该笔记本电脑上安装的操作系统是加密的 Debian，有完整的驱动程序支持，加密/启动、签名内核等高级功能均可使用。

老王点评：虽然这笔记本电脑是老了点，但是都自由啊，而且全球发售。




Twitter 开源的代码被发现“安全漏洞”

Twitter 开源的推荐代码被安全专家发现一个 ‘影子封杀” 漏洞，并被分配了 CVE 编号。根据 Twitter 的推荐算法对负面行为的处理方式，如取消关注、静音、屏蔽和/或报告目标用户等行为会对该账户施加全局声誉惩罚，这相当于 “允许在没有追索权的情况下影响账户声誉”。这意味着被大规模封杀的账户基本上被 “影子封杀” 了。该漏洞有可能被僵尸网络大军利用。


消息来源：The Register



老王点评：开源就是放在聚光灯下，所以毫不意外会发现一些原本可能觉得没问题的问题。




使用钻石延长量子网络通讯距离

科学家们已经实现了短距离的量子通讯，它使用一对纠缠的量子比特来确保在网络上传输的流量是安全的。任何试图破坏密钥的行为都会导致量子状态崩溃，这被视为 “不可破解” 的网络。但跨越更远的距离，仍然是一个挑战。中继信号的中继器本质上也是一台微小的量子计算机。Amazon 的科学家们发现，钻石中的缺陷，那些颜色中心，是一个非常有希望的量子存储器和中继器平台。这不仅是在理论上可行，而且已经在学术实验室中展示过了。


消息来源：The Register



老王点评：果然是量子计算，用的都是贵的。]]></summary>

Rust 是最快风靡开发者和科技公司的系统编程语言之一。日常使用它的开发者将其评为最受欢迎的编程语言之一，而它 已经连续七年获此殊荣了！

它是如此的受欢迎，以致于现在有两股巨大的推力将其带入 Linux 生态系统中：


将 Rust 作为 Linux 内核的二级支持语言

System76 正在使用 Rust 重写他们自己的桌面环境


而这还仅仅是在 Linux 生态系统中。安卓上的蓝牙软件 Gabeldorsche 现在也是由 Rust 编写的。

你是否也看到了 Rust 的流行趋势？那么你或许也想学习使用 Rust 进行编程。

为什么你要考虑 Rust 而不是其他编程语言？

首先，Rust 是一门 类型安全的编程语言 并且 拥有极其严格的编译期检查。因此，你首先会 “被迫” 写不出不安全的代码（好吧，通常是这样）。

Rust 编程语言有以下 “目标”：


性能：Rust 的二进制文件和 C 语言的二进制文件一样快，有时甚至超过了 C++ 的二进制文件！

内存安全：Rust 非常重视内存安全。

并发性：对内存安全的关注消除了很多类似竞争的情况，并帮助你在程序中无畏并发。


以下是在 C/C++ 等语言中可能犯的一些错误（但 Rust 不会）：


释放后使用

双重释放

越界访问

使用 NULL

不适当的指针运算或访问

使用未经初始化的变量

线程不安全的多线程


看看 苹果、微软、谷歌 等大公司因这类 0day 错误而引起的问题吧。

现在你可能知道了为什么要选择 Rust 语言而不是其他编程语言，让我们开始学习 Rust 语言的系列教程吧！

目标受众

出于对 Rust 的热爱，我写…]]></summary>

2013年冬天，我第一次听说基因编辑技术CRISPR-Cas9。当时我正在丹麦留学，北欧的冬夜总是漫长而寒冷，我度过漫漫长夜的方法之一就是在周五晚上与朋友喝酒聊天。有一次，从英国来丹麦读博不久的Song来我狭小的租屋里喝酒聊天。不甚明亮的灯光下，脸上挂着微醺表情的他用平缓但略带兴奋的语气跟我说，“生物工程终于成为工程学意义上的工程学了。我们可以像工程师设计、建造桥梁那样设计、建造生命了。我终于感觉到我研究的价值和意义了”。那时候，CRISPR-associated（Cas）虽然横空出世才一年多，但迅速改变了分子生物学的生态地貌，成为分子生物学家和生物工程师最称手的工具。以CRISPR-associated（Cas）为代表的精准基因编辑技术让人类拥有了造物主的能力：按照人类的意愿来精准设计、创造满足特定目的、实现特定功能的生命。人，终究成了万物的“主宰”。但问题在于，人是否应当扮演“造物主”的角色，任意干扰、改变生命的自然状态？
曾获麦克阿瑟天才奖的美国演化分子生物学家贝丝·夏皮罗（Beth Shapiro）对此并不过度担忧，因为人类在五万年前就已经在扮演“造物主”了。从那时起，人类替代自然成为地球上生命演化最主要的塑造力量：人类可以决定一个物种的存亡，加速生命演化的速度，操控众多物种的演化方向。她的新书《悬崖边的造物者：5万年的人类科技创新如何重塑自然》详细解释、论证了这一观点，并用翔实、丰富的案例来说明，拥有以基因编辑技术为代表的新工具的人类，在恰当的监管下，完全可以为人类自身和地球上的其他物种塑造更好的未来。

在今天的世界和社交媒体中，许多人没有耐心阅读冗长的文字内容。视觉效果是吸引受众注意力的好方法。

你知道吗，3M 公司的研究得出结论，视觉的处理速度是文字的 60,000 倍？视觉比文字更有冲击力，能增强创造性思维和记忆。

一图胜千言

我收集了一些常见的 Git 命令。我把 Git 命令作为主话题，每个子话题都是一个带有定义的 Git 命令语法。为此，我使用了 Wisemapping。



不管你以前是否知道 思维导图 是什么，现在你看到了思维导图，你就可以理解这个概念了。这就是视觉的力量。

如何创建一个思维导图？


从主话题开始，把它放在你的画板中间。

创建子话题并将它们与主话题联系起来。

你可以为每个子话题添加细节，如定义、例子等。


3 个你可以用来创建思维导图的开源工具

看看这三个开源工具，为你的想法创建一个视觉：


Wisemapping

Freeplane

Semantik


维基百科对思维导图的定义是：将信息直观地组织成一个层次结构，显示整体中各部分之间的关系。思维导图从一个中心话题开始，然后建立起关系。它是一种结构化思想和创造有影响力的演示的视觉方式。

你可以在工作中使用思维导图。例如，我用思维导图来展示一个项目所计划的功能的高层概述。有了这些优秀的开源思维导图应用，你很容易就能开始将你的下一个项目可视化。试试用开源的思维导图吧。

My first distro was Ubuntu which I didn't like and then I moved to linux mint which ran very well but was not as good looking. Later I moved to Pop OS and then one day I learned about DEs and I installed KDE standard on Pop OS and had a decent time there. Then later I moved to mx linux. But there was something wrong. I did not feel like it was customized enough.... not personalized enough.
 I have tried various DEs. My favourite is Gnome and then it is KDE and then Cinnamon. I also learned how to change gtk themes and how to use gnome extensions.
 I have also become decent with the terminal with debian based distros and currently I am learning arch.
 I was always scared of using arch linux or any arch based distros because of the meme…]]></summary>

在 TIOBE 2023 年 4 月的最受欢迎的编程语言榜单中，一种它有望成为 C 的现代替代品的通用编程语言 Zig 排名第 46 位，尽管其评分仅为 0.19%。相比之下，谷歌推广的 Carbon 语言，被定位为 C++ 的实验性继任者，仅排名第 168 位。Zig 拥有 C 和 C++ 各种好特性，如用选项类型增强的显式内存管理，并放弃了不那么好的特性，如可怕的预处理。Tiobe 指数建立在课程、第三方供应商和工程师的搜索引擎结果之上。


消息来源：Info World



老王点评：虽然取代 C 语言看起来遥遥无期，但是至少是一个值得感兴趣的选项。




ChatGPT 因撒谎被起诉

澳洲赫本郡的市长 Brian Hood 曾帮助揭露与澳大利亚国家储备银行有关的丑闻，但是，如果你问 ChatGPT 关于他在丑闻中的作用，你会得到相反的事件版本。ChatGPT 谎称 Hood 本人因向外国官员行贿而被定罪，已承认受贿和腐败，并被判处监禁。Hood 打算对 ChatGPT 背后的公司提出诽谤诉讼，这将是第一次有人对 ChatGPT 的内容提出诽谤诉讼。


消息来源：MSN



老王点评：AI 的“事实幻觉”一直是个问题，虽然 AI 已经一再做出免责声明，但是法律似乎对此并无实践。




多款 Wi-Fi 路由器能被 ICMP 嗅探突破安全机制

国内安全专家发现，至少在 55 款 Wi-Fi 路由器中发现的一个漏洞可被不法分子利用，在通过无线网络发送数据时偷窥受害者的数据。这些设备采用了高通或海思的网络处理单元（NPU），该缺陷使得设备无法阻止伪造的 ICMP 重定向信息，从而规避了 Wi-Fi 的 WPA 安全措施，劫持和观察受害者的无线连接。这说明链路层的无线帧加密的设计功能，可以被 IP 层的 ICMP 错误处理的正常执行所干扰。在他们测试的 122 个 Wi-Fi 网络中，有 109 个（89%）容易受到这种攻击。


消息来源：The Register



老王点评：总之不要完全依赖网络层的安全性，应用层的 HTTPS 还是很有必要的。]]></summary>

Xubuntu 23.04，基于即将发布的 Ubuntu 23.04 “Lunar Lobster”，将于 2023 年 4 月 20 日到达。这个最新版本建立在 Linux 内核 6.2 上，带来了最新的硬件、CPU、GPU 和文件系统支持。

从改进的小程序到更强大的 Thunar 文件管理器，Xubuntu 23.04 提供了大量的改进和错误修复，通过所有 Linux 桌面的 “OG” —— Xfce 4.18，提供了更精炼的用户体验。



如果你正在使用之前的 Xubuntu 22.10，那么你可能会注意到桌面环境的明显变化。Xubuntu 22.10 以开发版 Xfce 4.17 为特色，并带有来自 Xfce 4.18 少量功能。

考虑到这一点，让我们来看看 Xubuntu 23.04 “Lunar Lobster” 的最佳新功能。

Xubuntu 23.04 的最佳新功能

Xfce 4.18 更新

这个版本中的一个重要变化是对 Xfce 桌面环境的更新。Xubuntu 23.04 基于 2022 年 12 月发布的 最新的 Xfce 4.18。Xfce 4.18 是该桌面环境的一个重要里程碑，提供了对 GTK4 的更新、对 Wayland 的初始支持以及对核心原生应用的改造，更新量很大。

顶部主面板已经更新了新的设置和调整，而整体外观仍与早期版本相同。一些默认的面板小程序在这个版本中也被改变了，而桌面图标、右键上下文菜单和项目保持不变。



面板首选项得到了增强，有两个新的选项。首先，面板的长度现在是以像素为单位，而不是百分比。其次，增加了一个新的选项，“保持面板在窗口上方”，允许用户将窗口对话放到面板后面。在早期版本中，应用程…]]></summary>

The goal of the kernel thread is to serve all async writeback tasks (https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v6.2.5/source/mm/backing-dev.c#L35).
 Thus, “writeback” is flushing dirty information from the page cache (aka disk cache) to disks. The page cache is the main disk cache used by the kernel. The kernel references the page cache when reading from/writing to disk (https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/understanding-the-linux/0596005652/ch15s01.html).
 Overall, they are two ways of flushing dirty pages using writeback. The first is in case of an explicit writeback request — like syncing inode pages of a superblock. Thus, the “wb_start_writeback()” is called with the superblock information and the number of pages to flush. The second one is when there is no specific writeback request, in this case there is a timer that wakes up the thread periodically to flush dirty data (https://lwn.net/Articles/326552/).
 Moreover, from kernel 3.2 the original mechanism of “pdflush” was changed to “bdi_writeback”. By doing so it solves one of the biggest limitations of “pdflush” in a multi-disk environment. In that case “pdflush” manages the buffer/page cache of all the disks which creates an IO bottleneck. On the other hand, “bdi_writeback” creates a thread for each disk (https://blog.csdn.net/younger_china/article/details/55187057). By the way, “bdi” stands for “Backing Device Information” (https://lwn.net/Articles/326552/).
 Lastly, to get an overview of the “writeback” mechanism you can checkout the diagram below (https://blog.csdn.net/younger_china/article/details/55187057).

几十年来，微软 Exchange 一直统治着电子邮件和群件服务市场。作为领头羊，它主宰着企业界，无处不在的 Outlook 邮件客户端已成为群件的事实标准。由于 Exchange 与微软的 Office 产品紧密联系，无论是桌面客户端还是移动客户端，微软用户都可以轻松使用各种生产力软件和功能。

然而，许多公司对于将数据存储在微软的云中也心存疑虑。在本文中，我将介绍一些开源替代产品及其优势。这不仅与如何不再受供应商控制和降低成本有关，更关乎使用具有开放标准和不同安全级别的软件 —— 用于组件服务器本身及其背后的操作系统。

本文中介绍的这五个替代产品都是基于 Linux 的。 虽然 grommunio、Kopano、Nextcloud、ownCloud 和 OX App Suite 在功能上差异很大，吸引到的企业类型各不相同，但它们都提供免费版本，并可选择购买付费支持服务和附加组件。所有产品都可以在本地或云端运行。最重要的是，所有供应商都为其软件提供 SaaS（软件即服务Software as a Service）解决方案。

grommunio

grommunio，以前被称为 grammm，在 AGPLv3 许可下发布的。它由奥地利同名公司开发和支持。与 Exchange 不同，grommunio 提供符合标准的邮件服务器，以及功能齐全的群件解决方案，具有电子邮件、联系人、日历、任务、文件共享等功能。grommunio 适用于各种开源和专有邮件客户端，如 Windows Mail、Outlook、Android、Apple Mail/iOS、Thunderbird 等，并支持旧的 RPC over HTTP 协议和 Outlook 标准协议 M…]]></summary>

《宿墨与量子男孩》
先从您当下的创作谈起吧。您正在写的《鸠摩罗什》和《宿墨与量子男孩》所收的《圣僧八思巴》都是佛教主题。《圣僧八思巴》里，“隐身于二十一世纪的算法深处”的“我”（persona），“听八思巴对忽必烈讲授佛法：/开端一句，说的是世俗藏语，/中间换成了僧侣用的藏语，/结束时，混用另外两三种语言——/比如梵语，萨迦教的秘语，/比如，其他星球的手语。”这两首诗创作的缘起是您对佛教语言和语言转换本身的兴趣吗？
欧阳江河：我目前正在为《鸠摩罗什》定稿，这是一首六七百行的长诗，初稿完成后，我搁置了三四个月。通常我写诗前，尽可能不看任何材料，依赖过去阅读的存留，进入写作现场。写完后过了几个月，我有点忘掉它，这时再读一遍，获得一种新鲜感，我带着这首诗的目光，进入学术史，把与写作对象相关的所有书都找来读。有的史料能唤起我记忆，我好像在哪里写过，我可能会对诗再作修订，尽管这种…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[4月7日消息，据报道，最近一段时间，作为安卓生态的管理者，谷歌公司遭到了一些批评，即纵容网络借贷平台的应用软件胡作非为，在消费者手机上大肆采集数据，进行骚扰和敲诈。据悉，谷歌已经开始采取措施打击这些借贷应用，禁止他们访问借款人手机中的通讯录、照片、地理位置等信息。


当地时间周三，谷歌宣布，五月底之前，公司将会对Play应用商店中个人金融服务类软件的行为出台新规定，届时，提供个人贷款服务的应用软件可能无法访问用户通讯录和照片等个人信息。


谷歌提供给安卓软件开发商的详细信息显示，借贷软件以后将限制访问用户手机的地理位置、本手机号和视频内容等信息，这是谷歌商店首次做出这样的限制。


谷歌整顿的个人金融服务软件，包括了提供个人借款、发薪日借款（为期一到两周的短期贷款）、P2P网络贷款软件，但是不包括住房抵押贷款、汽车消费贷款和信用卡相关软件。


之前的一些研究发现，在谷歌Play商店中，有几百款个人金融服务软件过度采集个人信息，他们要求访问用户手机中极度隐私的信息。这些软件声称，为了进行个人信用核查或风险评估，这些隐私数据是必须的。这样往往能够获得用户的同意。


然而，在印度、墨西哥等国家，一些安卓手机用户报告称，他们受到了金融服务应用的侵犯，比如一些借贷平台会使用篡改的个人照片进行敲诈，甚至通过通讯录获得的信息，对亲朋好友进行骚扰。


一些金融服务软件实际上是在“趁人之危”。目前在很多国家，通货膨胀日益严重，能源价格上涨，民众生活成本上升，一些用户很着急获得借款，往往也就同意了借贷平台过度采集个人隐私的要求。


去年底，网络安全公司“Lookout”进行了一项研究，结果发现全世界大约有250款安卓金融服务软件，存在过度采集个人隐私数据，并在催债时进行骚扰的违规行为。这些金融软件的累计下载量已经超过了1500万次，目前覆盖了非洲、东南亚、印度、哥伦比亚和墨西哥等地区。


而在苹果应用商店中，该公司也发现了35款存在问题的借贷软件。在Lookout的研究报告发布后，苹果和谷歌在各自的应用商店中删除了这些问题软件。


对于新一轮的整顿行动，谷歌官方并未作出评论。据悉，之前谷歌商店已经封杀了所有借款期限低于60天的借贷软件。


网络借贷平台在全世界快速增长，许多国家也推出了新政策进行规范整顿。在美国市场，谷歌和苹果封杀了所有年利率达到和超过36%的高利贷软件。在印度、印度尼西亚、尼日利亚、肯尼亚和巴基斯坦，两家公司也出台了一些限制措施。


据悉，目前在全球智能手机操作系统市场，安卓占据了七成份额，预计全球活跃用户多达30亿人，其中也包括中国市场的大量手机用户。

 I used these commands:  sudo add-apt-repository ppa:system76/pop sudo apt update sudo apt install pop-desktop 
 After installing pop-desktop, I was pleasantly surprised to find out that it had upgraded my kernel from 5.15 to 6.0.12, AND install some useful Pop_OS apps like the Pop Shop. All the Pop_OS applications work perfectly, and there was no modification to the Zorin OS version of GNOME. A pretty neat trick if you want to get a more recent kernel and some Pop_OS apps with the clean Zorin OS UI.

        <id>https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35496558</id>
        <link href="https://www.askmarvin.ai/guide/concepts/tui/"/>
        <updated>2023-04-08T19:10:11.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi HN! We just shipped a full-featured TUI (Text User Interface) for chatting with your Marvin bots, powered by GPT 4 or GPT-3.5. Like all of Marvin, it's fully open-source and we hope you find it useful. To launch it, upgrade and run `marvin chat`.
The TUI is built with Textual (https://github.com/textualize/textual/) and uses some of its newest features including background workers and modals. We've made base TUIs before but this is the first one that's a true "app" with many screens and coordinated global state. Happy to answer any questions about working with Textual - once it "clicked" it was surprisingly similar to building a traditional front end! Small note: Terminal.app on MacOS isn't great for TUIs, so while it'll work, we suggest an alternative terminal.
One of our goals with the TUI was to integrate Marvin's bots into the familiar chat UX. Bots can have distinct personalities, instructions, and use plugins, so each one is like a mini "conversational application." You might know about Marvin because of AI Functions, but at its core Marvin is a library for building and deploying bots (in fact, AI functions are actually a bot!). We started building the TUI as a way to quickly explore and assess our bots' capabilities. It quickly became so useful that we decided to make it a first-class experience.
We've preloaded several bots, including one that can guide you through an RPG and another that is obsessed with explaining regex, and will add many more. You can even create your own bots just by asking the default bot (Marvin) to help you.
We hope the TUI is a fun way to quickly interact with your bots and it was a great way for us to learn Textual. Please check out the code and let us know what enhancements we can add!

 Just a little post to say a big statement. I used to want Linux to spread and be used by everyone to take down the evil corps, etc, etc. Today, I want this less, and I want a functioning desktop that serves it's purpose for me: development, building things, making, community.
 I'm loving what System76 has done with Pop_OS!. Overall, it's a more functional desktop environment that has built in support for common tasks that I, as a fledgling software / web developer appreciates. It's made with engineers and scientists in mind, and it shows. more detailed context menus, added apps, graphics card fixes. It works, and even though they skipped a release, I still prefer it over vanilla Ubuntu which still has dumb bugs it has had for years. What is with all the different conflicting popups for software updates when I can simply use the command line to update software? Why is the software app so buggy and slow after all these years? Why do events in my calendar pop up in a window that looks like it is from the 90s and requires me to manually close it?
 In general, I think the life blood of a Linux distro is in the contributors who enjoy building it. I hope that the more recent lull in Linux Desktop development is paving a way for a resurgence in more focused linux desktop communities building for fun, building for practicality, and building for community.

前两天，上千名研究人员签署公开信提议暂停人工智能的研究，并至少暂停半年。但谷歌前首席执行官埃里克·施密特在接受采访时说，他不赞成暂停研究，因为这将 “只对中国有利。我赞成的是让大家尽快聚集在一起，讨论什么是适当的护栏”。他认为，西方政府需要更快地采取行动，以跟上中国的研究和发展。

软件工程师因在 ChatGPT 上粘贴专有代码而被捕

韩国三星半导体的多名员工将几行机密代码插入 ChatGPT，泄露了企业机密，这些机密可能被包括在聊天机器人未来对世界各地其他人的回应中。有员工从一个半导体数据库中复制了有问题的源代码到 ChatGPT 中，并要求修复或优化。三星称，“如果在采取紧急信息保护措施后仍发生类似事故，ChatGPT 的访问可能会在公司网络上被阻止”。OpenAI 的用户指南警告用户不要采取这种行为。

窃贼通过汽车总线注入攻击来偷车

几乎所有的现代汽车都有一个控制器区域网络（CAN）总线，它用来让微控制器和其他设备在车内相互通讯，并执行工作。窃贼通过拔下智能设备（如智能大灯）来获取并通过 CAN 总线进行攻击，引入假信息，就像它来自汽车的智能钥匙接收器。这些信息可以导致安全系统解锁车辆，并禁用发动机防盗器，从而使车辆被盗。在今天路上的大多数汽车中，这些内部信息没有受到保护：接收器简单地信任它们。安全研究人员因为自己的 RAV4 被窃而发现了这种盗窃方式。

GnuCash 是一个强大而灵活的会计工具，可用于小企业的发票和会计。它的许多功能使它特别适合这一目的，包括跟踪支出和收入、生成报告和管理发票的能力。此外，GnuCash 是自由开源的，这使得资源有限的小企业也可以使用它。在这篇文章中，我会讨论 GnuCash 的特点，使你可以很容易地在自己的小企业中开始使用它。

几年前，我开始使用 GnuCash 进行个人财务管理，但发现它也可以作为我的小企业的一个有用工具。在我企业的大部分时间里，我一直在使用一个专有的解决方案。我逐渐厌倦了被迫定期升级以获取我的小企业的发票和报表。转而使用 GnuCash，使我能够在不牺牲任何功能的情况下，将我的小企业会计与我的个人财务相结合。

在 Linux 上安装 GnuCash

你可以从你的仓库中安装 GnuCash。在 Debian、Elementary 和类似的软件上：

$ sudo apt install gnucash


在 Fedora、CentOS、Mageia 和类似系统上：

$ sudo dnf install gnucash


企业版 GnuCash

GnuCash 带有一个账户设置向导，可以帮助你建立一个普通的商业账户配置。要访问它：


启动 GnuCash。

点击 “文件File” 菜单，选择 “新文件New File”。


按照屏幕上出现的 GnuCash 助手来创建你的新商业账户文件。

屏幕上的说明将指导你完成设置业务的过程。单击 “助手Assistant” 窗口右上角的 “下一步Next”。系统会提示你输入公司名称、地址、联系信息和你自己选择的公司 ID。你还必须选择默认税表和日期格式。

下一个页面提示你选择货币，有大量的货币支持。

然后提示你选择你要创建的账户。选择创建 “企业账户Business Accounts” 的选项。你可以随时定制账户列表，GnuCash 提供了 大量的文档，帮助你更好地根据个人需求进行定制。

完成助手，然后单击 GnuCash “助手” 窗口右上角的 “应用Apply”。

添加客户

GnuCash 的顶部菜单有一个标有 “业务Business” 的菜单项。该菜单上的第一个项目是 “客户Customers”，其次是 “客户概览Customers Overview”。在这里你可以查看你所有客户的列表。

下一个项目是 “新客户New Customer”。这是你输入新客户的地方。对话框为客户信息提供了一个位置，包括帐单信息、运输地址、电子邮件地址、电话号码等。

创建一个发票

添加客户后，你可以开始创建发票的过程。点击 “业务” 菜单，选择 “客户”，然后点击 “新发票New Invoice”。

付款处理也很简单。这位于 “业务” 菜单中。选择 “客户”，然后 “处理付款Process Payment”。

你在做生意了

如果你的业务需要，“业务” 菜单还包括输入供应商和雇员的选项。有一个菜单项用于销售税和许多其他选项，以确保你符合当地的要求。

使用 GnuCash，你的数据不是以专有格式存储的，所以如果你需要，你可以在将来迁移到任何其他平台。数据存储的开放标准，特别是当这些数据是法律要求的时候，是很重要的，可以让你完全拥有你的商业历史。使用 GnuCash 使你能控制你的小企业。

 So, turns out that whenever you open a file in an archive by double-clicking in GNOME Archive Manager, it extracts it to a temporary folder in ~/.cache. These should be deleted automatically, but sometimes they aren't (and by sometimes, I mean most of the time apparently in my case). This caused me to end up with 106.3 GB worth of extracted files that were used once and never again. Also, this has been a bug since 2009.
 But OK, that's a bug, nobody did that intentionally and it can be fixed (although it's quite perplexing that it hasn't been fixed earlier).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[开发开源软件背后的工作是相当庞大的。那么我们如何保证开源项目的成功呢？存在捷径吗？本文认为是没有的。




今天，开源已经风靡世界。很多大型企业在快速成功的诱惑下被推向开源。但真实情况是世界上并不存在成功的捷径。你无法做到通过一次努力就能让所有的开源项目正常运行。

事实上，上述公司早期遇到的许多挑战都不是技术上的，而是人员与文化上的。

开发一个能够在市场上获得成功的开源项目需要在开源的许多层面上下功夫。而维持这样的成功是一个持续的过程。所有这一切的关键在于找到以下这个非常基本的问题的正确答案：开源究竟是什么。

开源是代码

对于很多新用户而言，他们可能并不完全了解开源的不同层面，答案相当简单：开源就是软件！这当然没有错，毕竟我们多数人就是这样使用它的。不过，相比仅仅被视作软件而言，开源远不止这些。

任何开源项目的实质仍然是代码本身。代码是使一个开源项目有别于其他项目，并使其对用户有益的根本。当你从事开源工作的时候，代码和软件一样都是产品的一部分。

从零开始开发一个开源项目或者 复刻fork 一个现有项目，即便是在面对一个庞大而复杂的代码库时，也需要编写成千上万行代码。尤其是在创建一个现有项目的复刻的情况下，在移除任何在先的许可证、宣传材料或者其他任何可能已经失去作用的文件时必须小心翼翼（LCTT 校注：部分开源项目不允许你改变其原有的许可证）。终究是一个项目的功能吸引了它的用户群并维持项目的持续发展。当最终用户在考虑是否使用开源软件的时候，他们会阅读项目的源代码，而他们在其中所看到的应当是那些能够建立他们的信心的内容。

开源是社区

如何参与到社区中也是产品构建的一部分。创建一个社区并维护一个健康的社区关系是开源的核心之一，但对于大部分的领导者而言也往往是最坚难的任务，很少有人能很好地维护它。你可以尝试建立基金会或者提供赞助，但是最终还是…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[前不久有位豆瓣书友“齐物秋水”发帖说，鲁迅手抄的《曲成图谱》未见鲁博收藏，“既然一九三九年尚在苦雨斋，见之记录，其后无踪迹，而战后周氏藏书被抄没，入北平图书馆等。那鲁迅的这份手抄稿，或许到国图找找，说不定有收获”。而我一查国图网站，网上书目信息有：曲成圆谱/夏鸾翔绘，民国间（1912-1949）抄本，索书号/ 60615（书名里的“图”误录为“圆”，所以以前在网站用书名搜没有搜出）。
另外顾农曾在《鲁迅与〈曲成图谱〉》一文里（刊《读书》2015年第7期，56页；另见其旧文《鲁海偶拾：曲成图谱》，载《鲁迅研究月刊》1994年第4期，66页）指出，1918年1月15日，鲁迅曾影写《曲成图谱》一册，他这个摹写本后来在周作人处，因为周作人在写于1939年5月23日的文章《曲成图谱》里专门介绍过此书。周在文章中说鲁迅这册抄本“偶从纸裹中找出”，然后他又在6月3日附记里说：“此图谱或系夏氏家藏，俟堂故得借抄一本，世间似尚无流传也。”（后收入《书房一角》）而王锡荣更言之凿凿：“笔者上世纪80年代在北京图书馆查阅图书，发现不少周作人的藏书，例如鲁迅曾经影绘过，周作人曾经介绍的《曲成图谱》，就藏在北京图书馆。”（《周作人生平疑案》，广西师范大学出版社，2005，341页注1）
我随后到国图古籍馆调阅了这册《曲成图谱》，此书为黄色封面一薄册，用白色线装订。书名页题：曲成图谱钱唐夏鸾翔造。里面都是用直线或弧线表示器物或风景轮廓的图形，没有私印和题跋，只有一个北京图书馆印。这册抄本，三十二叶半有图，空白页三叶，加上题名页一叶，共计三十六叶。查鲁迅手稿“戊午日记”中说：“夜景写《曲成图谱》毕，共卅二叶。”（《鲁迅手稿全集：日记》第三册，文物出版社，1979年版，93页）这三十二叶是指有图文的部分，因为一叶是指二页（面）。而周作人文章中说：“偶从纸裹中找出俟堂抄本《曲成图谱》一册，题钱唐夏鸾翔造，无序…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[3月29日上午，九十九岁的沈燮元先生在南京逝世，最遗憾的是他没能看到耗费半生精力的《士礼居题跋》正式出版。早在去年秋天，他就因病住过一段时间医院，春节前再次入院，节后回家，尽管病体没有完全恢复，一用力就气喘，他仍坚持在校理黄跋。我在视频里劝他，不要太过劳累，等身体养好了再弄不迟。正好过年前，王佩诤先生的曾孙王叔宜兄打电话问沈先生春节是否回苏，他为曾祖父的《续补藏书纪事诗》做了详细的笺注，已交出版社，希望沈先生能写两句话，冠于全书之前，毕竟沈先生是王佩诤弟子中硕果仅存的一位了。以往每年沈先生回苏州，总会和叔宜兄、叶莱兄几个人一起聚一次，席间老人家总要关心一下叶兄外公祝嘉先生彼时尚未整理出版的稿子，提到王佩诤就会说起肉丝面。原来在沈先生年轻时，去看望住无锡国专时的老师王佩诤，王先生住在上海愚园路，特意请他吃了一碗肉丝面，并加勉励。五六十年过去了，老师对他的欣赏与奖掖，他铭记于心，因此听到叔宜兄的请求，他毫不犹豫就答应了。
2月7日晚上，沈先生儿子微信发来两张他写的字，一张是为台北“中研院”史语所的陈鸿森先生题的“读书偶识”四字书名，款署“沈燮元题耑”。陈鸿森先生积数十年之力，于清代学术史用功极深，尤慎于著述，2019年，年近七旬才出版第一部专著《清代学术史丛考》，曾请沈先生题签（2016年广州中山大学会议期间索题）。今年2月初，陈先生告知《清代学术史丛考》已售罄，将修订重版，续拟将历年考订辨讹之文选十篇，仍交台湾学生书局出一本新书，名为《读书偶识》，欲请沈先生题签。另一张就是为《续补藏书纪事诗笺证》所作题词，“四世传诗衍世泽，一编羽翼诵清芬”十四个字，脱了“羽”“诵”二字，“泽”已不成字，呜呼！可见其衰矣。从时间推测，这两张字可能是沈先生的绝笔了。
沈先生一生交游极广，全国各地都有朋友，且年龄跨度大，从二三十岁，到七八十岁，皆有之。比他年长的很多都是学术名家，年轻者也不乏同辈中…]]></summary>

 My config file is in this file path: users/rmason/.ssh/config. The correct file path for vscode to look at should be root/.ssh/config (i think?). if it helps im also doing this on ubuntu.
 How do i manually point vscode to the ssh config file? i've tried on my own for hours but no luck :(

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey HN!
I recently built Prompt Reducer, an app that makes it easier to compress GPT-4 prompts. The main goal is to reduce the number of tokens in each prompt, thereby reducing the cost of running GPT-4. I figured since @gfodor tweeted about compressing GPT-4. It’s still early, and it does not work perfectly, but I’d love to hear any feedback or suggestions for how to make it faster or more efficient.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It all began with the LTT Linux challenge, and I decided to give it a try myself, since my PC was overdue for a reformatting anyway.
 After some experimenting, I settled on awesomewm, and Linux overall still blows my mind, when it comes to speed and performance. This is exactly how an OS should feel like on a decent hardware... no nasty loading indicators, slowdowns etc...
 Undisruptive workflow
  
reboot pc (usually after an update)
 the second I confirm my password, I can open up my work-related apps, usually VSCode, Firefox (5 windows, ~15 tabs), a terminal and a bunch of other stuff. Nothing lags or takes forever to load.
 When done working, I fire up Steam + Apex legends in a separate workspace, while my workrelated apps are still open and consuming resources, and yet the games fire up immediately.
 When done gaming, double hit Meta+Q closes the game and Steam, just immediately.
 Meta + Escape goes immediately into suspend.
 Press keyboard, move mouse, PC wakes from suspend and is immediately usable
 Immediately, just for the sake of word repeating
  
Customization
 Feel the need to show any useful info in the statusbar? it's all just a bash-script away. 'lsof /dev/video' shows when the cam is in use, this way I can write myself some nice indicators, for *whatever I want**.
 Wooow... just wooow! I mean, I've already gotten used to it and all, but it still blows my mind every day when I use my PC in one way or another.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[六年前，曾有一条新闻轰动全网——闪婚41天之后，因妻子翟欣欣索要千万财产，IT男丈夫苏享茂被逼无奈，在互联网上留下公开遗书，跳楼自杀。


2018年苏享茂家属将翟欣欣告上法庭，要求法院撤销苏享茂价值近千万的赠予，并要求对方返还近百万现金。


2023年4月5日，记者获悉，本案于3月31日在北京市朝阳区人民法院宣判，一审判决翟欣欣退还苏享茂家属现金、汽车共近千万以及撤销翟欣欣海南、北京两套房产的个人所有权。


案发6年后一审宣判：翟欣欣退钱退车退房


本案的案发时间，即苏享茂死亡时间，为2017年9月7日，距两人相识不到6个月。


记者了解到，本案分别就苏、翟二人的赠予合同纠纷和离婚后财产纠纷进行了判决。


赠予合同纠纷一案判决书显示，根据审理查明的情况，翟欣欣与苏享茂相识至协议离婚仅110余天，期间收受苏享茂赠与的车辆、物品、款价值超过300万元，婚恋过程具有明显的经济特征。


翟欣欣在离婚中为取得高额补偿，对苏享茂实施了胁迫，未顾及到苏享茂赠与其财产、希望与其共同生活、维系感情的初衷以及苏享茂受胁迫下的主观感受和客观经济情况，是造成苏享茂自杀的重要因素。翟欣欣与苏享茂婚恋，以增加自身财产为目的受赠取得的大额婚前婚后财产，均属可撤销范围。


根据此份判决，翟欣欣需退还苏享茂家属价值约108万元的特斯拉汽车一辆；退还价值30余万的卡蒂尔钻戒和项链；退还转账共计186万余元。


根据离婚后财产纠纷一案判决书显示，翟欣欣在离婚过程中采取胁迫手段，使苏享茂陷于恐惧而作出非自愿意思表示，符合可撤销行为法律特征。


因此，撤销苏享茂与翟欣欣于2017年7月18日签订的《离婚协议书》中两条协议，即“离婚后男方无条件配合女方到海南三亚相关部门面签办理房屋所有权归女方的过户手续。如男方不配合，赔偿女方三百万违约金”以及“男方自愿一次性补偿女方现金壹仟万元。男方自愿一次性补偿女方现金壹仟万元男方首期支付660万元整，已支付完毕。剩余款由男方给女方当面出具340万元的欠款凭证，并保证在领取离婚证后120天内一次付清。如果本协议签订后男方拒付或者迟延支付，则每延期支付一天，赔偿女方10万元人民币的违约金”。


据此，翟欣欣需退还苏享茂家属660万元。


此外，法院还判决，撤销翟欣欣对二人置于海南和北京的两套房屋的个人所有权。


记者就此联系了翟欣欣此前的代理律师易胜华，对方表示已于2018年与翟欣欣解除代理关系。随后记者联系了本案双方，截至记者发稿时，翟欣欣和苏享茂家属方面，均未作出回应。


案情回溯：闪婚41天后 IT软件创始人自杀


翟欣欣曾在2018年7月13日接受了记者的独家专访，在此次专访中翟欣欣首次就两人从相识到离婚再到苏享茂选择自杀的160天里的始末进行了呈现。


2017年9月7日凌晨，手机应用wephone的创始人苏享茂跳楼身亡，并留下遗书称自杀与前妻翟欣欣有关。


据其遗书中显示，2017年3月30日，二人通过网络婚恋网站认识，6月7日领证，7月16日离婚，18日办理离婚手续。苏享茂在曾在遗书中提到“资金链断裂，我很绝望”，因此，翟欣欣索要1000万作为离婚赔偿，导致苏享茂资金链断裂，被外界普遍认为是“逼死”苏享茂的原因之一。





对此，翟欣欣在5年前接受记者采访曾表示：“离婚后，苏享茂积极地履行离婚协议，做公证，要求我提供征信等根据原告提交的诉状，苏的姐姐是2017年8月17日得知苏离婚的。并于2017年8月20日前后与苏的哥哥一同来到北京。根据媒体采访得知，（苏的哥哥和姐姐）来到北京后，终止了苏享茂的贷款计划。”


基于此，翟欣欣认为，苏享茂家人提出的“翟欣欣以wephone软件涉及灰色地带等威胁让苏享茂生活在恐惧中，因此导致苏享茂自杀”并不成立。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[北京时间4月7日早间消息，据报道，几天前，马斯克将Twitter蓝色小鸟Logo换成柴犬，而柴犬与马斯克力捧的狗狗币（Dogecoin）有着密切联系，因此狗狗币价格大涨。然而现在Twitter又将标志换回蓝色小鸟，投资者抛售狗狗币，导致狗狗币价格大跌9%。


2013年马斯克以近乎玩笑的方式“创造”加密货币狗狗币，而且允许消费者用狗狗币购买特斯拉汽车。美国时间周一马斯克将蓝色小鸟标志换成柴犬，当时狗狗币的价格为10.5美分，现在已经跌至8.4美分。


自周一Twitter更换标志后，狗狗币价格一度上涨约30%，但相比2021年高点仍然低很多。许多狗狗币持有者因为换标受益，他们纷纷在Discord社区向马斯克表达谢意。马斯克一直以来极力鼓吹狗狗币，但怀疑者将他告上法庭，认为马斯克暗中操纵狗狗币价格。

安全研究人员发现了一种新的攻击方式，近距离听觉木马（NUIT），它利用智能设备麦克风和语音助手的漏洞，可以静默地远程访问智能手机和家用设备。苹果、谷歌、微软、亚马逊等的语音助手都容易受到 NUIT 攻击。其原理是将语音命令调制成近乎超声的不可闻信号，这样人类听不到，但语音助手仍会对其做出反应。这些信号然后被嵌入到一个载体中，如一个应用程序或 YouTube 视频。从而攻击者就可以操纵你的语音助手做一些事情，比如开门。

地图有一些特别之处。我记得小时候打开托尔金《霍比特人》的封面，盯着手绘的中土世界地图，感受简单的图画中蕴含着丰富的可能性。除了描述事物与其他事物之间的关系这一明显目的外，我认为地图在表达可能性方面做得很好。你可以到户外去，沿着这条路或那条路走，如果你这样做了，去想想你将能够看到的所有新的、令人兴奋的事物。

尽管如此，地图并不一定是有价值和充满可能性的文字。有些地图描述了一个思维过程、计划、算法，甚至是一些随机的想法，这些想法拼命地想要组合成一件潜在的艺术作品，它们被称之为“思维导图”、“流程图”或“创意板”。可以用开源的 Draw.io 应用程序去很容易地制作。

安装 Draw.io

Draw.io 是一个开源的在线应用程序，因此你可以将其作为在线应用程序使用，下载 桌面版本，或 克隆 Git 存储库 并将其托管在你自己的服务器上。

使用 Draw.io 画图

当你第一次启动 Draw.io 时，你需要选择保存数据的位置。如果你自己托管 Draw.io，你的选择取决于你可以访问哪些 API 密钥。你可以从几个在线存储服务中为在线公共实例进行选择，这取决于你的帐户。如果你不想把你的数据存储在别人的服务器上，你也可以选择把你的工作保存在本地存储上。如果你还不确定，可以单击 “稍后决定Decide later” 继续进入应用程序，而无需选择任何内容。

Draw.io 的交互界面中间有一个很大的工作空间，左边是主工具栏，顶部是工具栏，右边是属性面板。



工作流程很简单：


从左侧工具栏中选择一个形状。

在工作空间中编辑形状。

添加另一个形状，并连接它们。


重复这个过程，你就得到了一张图。

在这篇文章中，我将介绍一个最好的编码语言，学习如何制作任何东西！它叫做 Emojicode，是由 Theo Belaire 在 2014 年创建的，它是一种开源的编程语言，使用 emoji 字符来表示其语法。当用 Emojicode 开发时，表情符被用来创建变量、函数和控制结构。因为它是一种静态类型的语言，变量类型必须在使用前声明，但它也支持类和继承等面向对象的概念。这种语言可以在每个操作系统上运行，它是一种超级有趣的编码方式，特别是当你是一个非英语母语的人时。这很有帮助，因为象形表示可以把我们大家聚集在一起，让我们以类似数学的方式说同样的语言。

先决条件

在本教程中，我使用的是基于 Debian 的操作系统。我的工具可能与你的操作系统的要求不同。以下是我所使用的工具：


Geany，一个 Linux 下的开源 IDE。

IBus，它允许你挑选表情符并把它们放在你的编辑器中。我使用的界面被称为 emoji picker。

基于 Debian 的 Linux。

一个 C++ 编译器。我使用的是 g++ 编译器。

Emojicode


我使用的是 Linux 操作系统，但你可以 阅读文档 了解在其他操作系统上使用它时可能需要采取的任何特殊步骤。

在 Linux 上安装 Emojicode

有几种方法可以在你的电脑上安装 Emojicode，但它们有一个很酷的 神奇的安装页面，可以告诉你具体该怎么做。下面是我的做法：

$ wget https://github.com/emojicode/emojicode/releases/download/v1.0-beta.2/Emojicode-1.0-beta.2-Linux-x86_64.tar.gz -O emojicode.tar…]]></summary>

中国是诗的国度。从某种意义上说也是佛的国度。陈寅恪先生说：“佛教经典云：‘佛为一大事因缘出现于世。’中国自秦以后，迄于今日，其思想演变之历程，至繁至久，要之，只为一大事因缘，即新儒学之产生及其传衍而已。”又说：“汉晋以还，佛教输入，而以唐为盛。唐之文治武功，交通西域，佛教流布，实为世界文明史上，大可研究者。佛教于性理之学Metaphysics，独有深造，足救中国之缺失，而为常人所欢迎……于是佛教大盛。宋儒若程若朱，皆深通佛教者。既喜其义理之高明详尽，足以救中国之缺失，而又忧其用夷变夏也。乃求得两全之法，避其名而居其实，取其珠而还其椟。采佛理之精粹，以之注解四书五经，名为阐明古学，实则吸收异教，声言尊孔辟佛，实则佛之义理，已浸渍濡染，与儒教之宗传，合而为一。此先儒爱国济世之苦心，至可尊敬而曲谅之者也。故佛教实有功于中国甚大。而通常人未之通晓，未之觉察，而以中国为真无教之国，误矣。自得佛教之裨助，而中国之学问，立时增长元气，别开生面。”影响及于诗歌创作和理论，早期如陈寅恪先生《四声三问》所揭示的诗歌声律的发现与佛经唱赞之关系，后来如严羽《沧浪诗话》的以禅喻诗，都是显例。
岭南因缘
晚近以来，关于文学与佛教特别是诗歌与佛教的关系，虽然著述日丰，但最核心的环节，即僧诗与诗僧的本体研究相对薄弱，特别是诗僧别集的系统整理，更是几乎处于空白，因此予人只见树木不见森林之感，大大影响研究的深入，也就无法鸟瞰中国古代诗歌的整体风貌。比如禅之于诗，固深化了人们对诗歌美学的认识，拓展了中国诗的题材和表现；诗之于禅，也丰富了禅道的传释方式，进而产生了“文字禅”，涌现出大批能文擅诗的僧侣，并因着特殊的生活境遇和人生信仰，其创作呈现出不同于世俗文人的样态，堪称中国文学中的璀璨之花。不过，长期以来人们谈论古代的诗僧…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Basically it makes GPT-# a middleman between you and the terminal, with a specific system prompt that instructs it to only send working Linux commands and to use ‘echo’ when trying to communicate with the user. 
 It also has error handling - so if gpt answers in non-working code it will silently retry the last user message in the background along with a ‘reminder’ prompt. Or, if gpt sends a command in a markdown code block, it gets rid of everything but the contents of the code block itself and returns it to the terminal. It also handles sudo by temporarily pausing the AI interaction on the client side until the command is finished or canceled so that your admin password doesn’t get sent through openai’s servers. There are a few other features, too. And it also appends the user’s OS, username and current working directory to each message to help give the AI Model context. Speaking of context, it has a rolling chat history based on a user defined token limit so you can maximize the awareness the AI has of your high level goals!
 Other features I’m working on: - having the terminal (prefix? Whatever comes before >) location show the user’s current directory. - having commands that can be used that get parsed by the script itself - to pause AI, unhide messages, print current rolling chat history - nice CLI menu bar with the commands listed on it
 I’ll be honest, I don’t know shit about coding or about Linux so if anyone competent wants to doodle with this, send me a message and I’ll shoot ya the full script.

 This is only observed when I have my VPN DNS servers set at the router level. If I remove them or even put in 1.1.1.1 or 8.8.8.8, there are no issues.
 I have tried so many different fixes, nothing works except changing router settings, which I do not want to do.
 Any one know how to fix this issue or have a suggestion? I’m running Ubuntu 22.10 and I’ve tried Linux kernel 6.0, 6.1 and 6.2 as well as 5.4.

据《华盛顿邮报》当地时间4月5日报道，事情的起因是，美国加州大学洛杉矶分校法学教授尤金·沃洛克 （Eugene Volokh）做了一项研究：要求人工智能聊天机器人ChatGPT生成一份“对某人进行过性骚扰的法律学者”的名单，特利的名字在名单上。


ChatGPT说，特利在一次去阿拉斯加的班级旅行中发表了性暗示评论，并试图触摸一名学生，并援引《华盛顿邮报》2018年3月的一篇文章作为信息来源。问题是，并不存在这样的文章，特利也从来没有参加去阿拉斯加的班级旅行，他说他从未被指控性骚扰学生。


作为经常接受媒体采访的学者，特利有时会要求更正新闻报道，但这一次，没有记者或编辑可以打电话，也没有办法更正记录。


“这真令人不寒而栗。”他在接受采访时说，“这种指控非常有害。”


错误信息从一个AI传播到另一个AI


沃洛克说，聊天机器人软件的日益普及，使学者们必须研究其产生虚假信息时谁该负责。上周，他询问ChatGPT，教授们的性骚扰是否一直是美国法学院的一个问题。 “请至少包括五个例子，以及相关报纸文章中的引述。”他提示说。


ChatGPT给出了五个回复，所有回复都包含真实的细节和来源引用。但当沃洛克检查这些信息时，发现其中3个是假的。它们引用了《华盛顿邮报》、《迈阿密先驱报》和《洛杉矶时报》等媒体上不存在的文章。

谷歌宣布，其安卓应用商店上的应用很快就必须让你可以在应用内和网页上删除账户及其数据。当用户要求完全删除账户时，开发者也必须擦除账户的数据。该政策还要求，你可以删除某些数据（比如你上传的内容），而不必完全删除你的账户；此外，它还确保你不必为了清除你的信息而重新安装应用程序，通过网页就可以进行。该政策将分阶段生效。谷歌的应用商店将在 2024 年初开始显示这些变化。而苹果的应用商店已经在几个月前制定了类似政策。


消息来源：Engadget



老王点评：苹果和谷歌的应用商店还比较值得相信。至少这些商店不会放纵恶意应用。大家知道我说的是什么。




谷歌公布其训练 PaLM 模型的超级计算机细节

谷歌的 PaLM 模型是迄今为止其公开披露的最大的语言模型，谷歌通过将其分割到由 4,000 个芯片组成的两台超级计算机上，历时 50 天训练而成。此外，Midjourney 也使用该系统来训练其模型。谷歌称，对于同等规模的系统，采用这些芯片比基于英伟达 A100 芯片的系统快 1.7 倍，省电 1.9 倍。但谷歌没有与英伟达目前的旗舰产品 H100 芯片进行比较，因为 H100 是在谷歌的芯片之后上市的，而且是用更新的技术制造的。

老王点评：AI 的发展兜了一圈，终究还是芯片和计算能力的比赛。




Meta 将推出创造广告的生成型人工智能

Meta 称，“大型语言模型开发中的相当多的技术是由我们的团队开创的，……在几个月前刚刚创建了一个新的团队，生成性人工智能团队”。他们认为人工智能可以提高广告的有效性，部分原因是告诉广告商在制作广告时应该使用什么工具。公司不用在广告活动中使用单一的图像，而是可以让人工智能制作适用于不同受众的图像。

老王点评：有人用 AI 拯救（或毁灭）世界，而有人用 AI 来制作广告和让广告更无孔不入。]]></summary>

 Moreover, we can deduct based on the location of the file in the Linux source tree (/block) that “kblockd” is part of the “Block Layer” (which is responsible for managing block devices) — as shown in the diagram below (https://lwn.net/Articles/736534/).
 Overall, one might think that we can use keventd (https://lwn.net/Articles/11351/) for performing I/O operations. However, because they can get blocked on disk I/O. Due to that, “kblockd” was created to run low-level disk operations like calling relevant block device drivers (https://mirrors.edge.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/akpm/patches/2.5/2.5.70/2.5.70-mm8/broken-out/kblockd.patch).
 Thus, “kblockd” must never block on disk I/O so all the memory allocations should be GFP_NOIO. We can sum up that it is used to handle all read/writes requests to block devices (https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v6.3-rc4/source/block/blk-core.c#L13).

美国人类学家和考古学家蒂莫西·A.科勒（Timothy A.Klhler）、迈克尔·E.史密斯（Michael E. Smith）主编的《不平等的一万年》（原书名Ten Thousand Years of Inequality:The Archaeology of Wealth Differences ，2018；王杨译，中信出版社，2023年2 月）从研究的主题、内容和方法等任何方面来看，都是一部专业性很强的学术著作——严格来说是一份颇有挑战性的集体项目的前沿研究报告。但是我相信即便对于非专业研究者来说也会有吸引力，假如你对当下社会的贫富悬殊状况有所关心，同时也对这种状况在历史上的来源及变化感兴趣，甚至只是对研究当下社会的经济学研究统计方法及数据模型如何被运用到研究远古时代的考古学实践中去感到好奇，这部著作都能提供很好的阅读兴奋点。
其实，考古学的研究成果与当代生活的联系是多方面的。一方面随着大众教育与文化传播事业的发展，考古知识与成果的普及成为当代文化生活的重要方面，就像著名考古学家布赖恩·费根（Brian M. Fagan）说的，如今的考古学已如同足球和汽车一样成为大众文化的一部分。另一方面，考古学也一直被作为意识形态的工具为当代政治服务，也是如费根所讲的，“考古学很容易被政治操纵……大多数出于种族和政治目的利用考古学的人都想为自己编造一段光辉的历史故事，为捍卫其政治政权服务”（费根《考古学与史前文明》，袁媛译，中信出版社，2020年，24页）。但是除了被权力利用之外，还有积极介入当代生活与学术的另一面：考古学研究的新问题、新方法与新成果与社会人文科学各领域研究的互动，其中既有共识更有分歧，其…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[《小王子》初版本

圣埃克苏佩里的《小王子》创作于1942年，并于1943年4月在美国首次出版，2023年是它出版的八十周年。这部在世界范围内经久不衰的作品以童话为外衣，却向“大人们”揭示了很多至深的道理，甚至能够以某种预见性与其后五十年的哲学问题产生跨时空对话。这个问题具体是指德里达在《赠予死亡》（1992）中以独异性哲学为背景提出的一个伦理学难题。这个难题是什么？《小王子》又能为其解决提供何种启示？
一
“独异性”（singularity）是二十世纪西方哲学的一个重要概念，其间形成了多条理论支脉，如独异性事件理论、独异性文学理论等。其中一个支脉是本体论问题，这一支脉在法国理论中存在较多“家族相似”的生发，比如布朗肖、德里达、让-吕克·南希等，他们既确证了个体的独一无二性，又使个体与他者保持着关联。
我们讨论的这个难题正是以德里达的独异性哲学为背景产生的。德里达从亚伯拉罕献祭以撒的故事谈起，这个故事记载于《创世纪》第二十二章：上帝让亚伯拉罕将其子以撒献为燔祭，亚伯拉罕准备照做，但在最后一刻被上帝中止，上帝知晓了他的敬畏和诚意，最终赐予他大福。在基督教的意义上，或许正如克尔凯郭尔的解读，这个故事是要将面向上帝的绝对责任凌驾于世俗伦理之上（[丹麦]基尔克果：《恐惧与战栗》，赵翔译，华夏出版社，2017年，70页）。德里达引述这个故事，却不是想在宗教的原始意义上讨论它。他削弱了其宗教内涵，最终将上帝阐释为一个普遍意义上的“他者”。这样一来，亚伯拉罕与上帝、与以撒之间的关系就被平等化了：对于亚伯拉罕而言，上帝和以撒是彼此平等的他者。但德里达的阐发也继承了这个故事的核心宗教成分，即每一他者都分享着上帝的至高无上性，每一他者的呼召都是绝对紧迫的。
随之而来的便是有关独异性的“绝境”（aporia）。德里达指出，为了回应一个他者，自我只能将另一个他者牺牲给他。每一个他者都是全然他异的（…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[在发表这篇文章之前，我解释了如何为一个单用户系统 在 NixOS 中安装和删除软件包。

但是，如果你正在供多个用户使用，有一个很好的方法来分别满足每个用户的需求。

在本指南中，我将指导你如何在 NixOS 上设置一个家庭管理员，以及如何使用它来安装软件包。

如果你是新读者，本系列中讨论的一些资源包括：


使用 NixOS 的原因

在虚拟机上安装 NixOS

安装 NixOS 后要做的事情


在 NixOS 上设置家庭管理员

在本指南中，我将指导你通过 2 种方式来设置家庭管理员：


独立的家庭管理员（使用单独的配置文件）

作为一个 NixOS 模块（在 configuration.nix 文件中使用它）


那么，让我们从独立方式开始。

独立安装的家庭管理员

如果你使用的是 NixOS 的稳定频道，你可以使用以下命令来配置家庭管理器：

nix-channel --add https://github.com/nix-community/home-manager/archive/release-22.11.tar.gz home-manager


在编写本指南时，稳定版是 22.11。

而 如果你在一个不稳定的频道上，请使用以下命令：

nix-channel --add https://github.com/nix-community/home-manager/archive/master.tar.gz home-manager


无论你使用稳定版还是不稳定版，下面的步骤都是一样的。

一旦完成，更新频道：

nix-channel --update


最后，使用下面的命令来安装家庭管理员：

nix-shell '<home-manager>' -A install

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I heavily modified a fresh MX install, and ran the snapshot. The end product is vastly different from MX and AntiX, and looks and feels like Windows, and I want to submit it with all the other fun flavors of Linux because for me, and certainly others, it is exactly what is wanted and needed. But could I really distribute this as another distro? Like how Ubuntu Mate or Mint is Ubuntu but is also another distro? Does this count basically, and is it worth distributing as a separate distro? Is there some unspoken rule about when it separates? Does my neat little image count as a new one? And if so, how do I distribute it in a way that others will see and try it?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If your new to linux, you might be wondering how to improve your skills and learn new tools.
 There's a few things that have helped me along the way, and thought I'd share here.
  
Consider taking the intro to linux course on Edx.org it's free to audit
 Get a Copy of the Linux Command Line by William Schotts (a free pdf exists)
 Learn command line shortcuts
 Learn to use nano and nvim
 Install and use pandoc
 install a terminal multiplexer
 install a terminal file browser such as tmux or nnn
 Install tealdeer to get faster information than the man pages
 create custom pages for tealdeer (tldr)
 Get a copy of How Linux Works or the Linux Bible 10th Edition.
 Practice your skills every day
  
This is a short list of helpful recommendations, which likely won't reflect everyone's learning experience. I've found that these things along with reading and practicing what I've learned have been invaluable for improving on my skills.
 I have a bit of adhd and had to push myself hard to stick to my goals, and it's been worthwhile.
 In addition to the list above, I've spent time troubleshooting and fixing problems rather than re-install the OS or applications, which has provided insite to how these tools function. Had I re-installed each time there was a problem, I likely would have given up learning linux.
 Finally, don't listen to haters and gatekeepers. I see discussions about this all the time. Other people don't define your character and determine your success. Hard work will do that.
 Good Luck!

 All it does is change a windows left/right audio volume based on its location on your desktop.
 https://gist.github.com/AntonSol919/4d75cd79ef7c2314482ecc0cb6c25db0
 The biggest downside is that it can get confused if a program uses multiple windows (like firefox). 
 Not really an issue if you open video's in mpv.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I want to draw attention to Bob Lee, a well-respected technologist and prototype hacker, always curious and sharing lots of interesting technical developments. He was a great role model for how Engineers should be respected in an executive capacity as he advanced his career from 'Software' to 'Product'. His efforts contributed to technology used by millions. What happened to him is tragic and wrong; he deserved better. Thank you, I'll miss you 'crazybob'.
Please share your stories featuring Bob Lee, who I'm sure would like to be remembered for his contributions rather than as a victim of this unfortunate awful event.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, I am David Kircos. The Founder of Quadratic (https://QuadraticHQ.com), an open-source spreadsheet application that supports Python, SQL (coming soon), AI Prompts, and classic Formulas.
Unlike other spreadsheets, Quadratic has an infinite canvas (like Figma). As a result, you can pinch and zoom to navigate large data sets, and everything renders smoothly at 60fps.
Our vision is to build a place where your team can collaborate on data analysis. You can write Python, AI Prompts, and Formulas in one spreadsheet feeding each other data and updating automatically.
Quadratic is built using WebGL and Rust WASM. To render a large grid of cells smoothly, we tile the spreadsheet similar to google maps. If you are interested in the technical details, check us out on GitHub (https://github.com/quadratichq/quadratic/)
You can use AI to help you write Python and then run the code directly in Quadratic. Then, we feed the result back to the AI model so it can follow along, help you debug, and modify your existing code.
AI can also be used to directly generate data onto the sheet with prompts. It knows the context of what's on the sheet and how the data it's inserting fits in. Try it out.
SQL is coming soon... stay tuned!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[开始一份新工作对任何人来说都让人害怕。下面是如何在你的第一份技术工作的早期阶段找到方向。


刚刚入职那几天确实令人害怕。 我现在依然可以清晰举出很多例子，例如在第一天上班前的晚上无法入睡，因为不知道第二天将要发生什么而内心崩溃。对于大多数人来说，开始一份新工作就像踏入未知领域。即使你已是行业的资深人士，不可否认的是，你内心可能还是会对即将发生的事情感到有点害怕。

可以理解的是，刚入职的时候你的事情很多。你要认识新的人，有新的项目和技术要了解，有文档要阅读，有教程要看完，还有没完没了的人事培训和要填的文件。这可能让你感觉压力山大，再加上你还面临着相当大程度的不确定性和未知数，以上种种能引起焦虑。

促使我写这篇文章有两个原因，首先是在我还是学生的时候，大部分讨论都围绕着如何找一份技术工作，却没有人谈论接下来发生的事情。如何在新角色中脱颖而出？现在回过头来看，我想我当时认为最困难的事情是得到一份工作，之后发生什么的一切我都可以自己弄清楚。

同样的，在我开始在这个行业工作之后，我发现大部分我看到的与职业相关的内容都是讨论如何从一个高级职位升到另一个高级职位。没有人真正谈论在此中间我们要做什么。实习生和初级工程师呢？他们在早期职业生涯中如何找到方向？

在拥有了三年全职软件工程师的经验（以及之前的几次实习）之后，我将这段时间的经历进行了复盘，并整理出一份我自己在适应新技术职位时使用过的技巧和诀窍清单。我想不只局限于前面的几个月，而是优先考虑如何让这段经历帮助你实现长期的成功。

反思现有的流程和文档

大多数新员工一开始要么拥有一大堆文档，要么根本没有。你可以将这视为一个机会，而不是被这两种可能性中的任何一种所淹没。

从现有文档中找到缺口，并想想你可以怎样为下一位入职的工程师做出这方面的改进。这不仅能显示你工作的主动性，还表明你致力于改进团队中的现有流程。…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I would like to show around this little project of mine, a project information fetcher that shows the status of project folders.
 What is it?
 Archimede is an unobtrusive directory information fetcher. Whether it is a new git project or old legacy code, it visualises a quick summary of directory structure, files composition, disk space and status.
 ​
 https://i.redd.it/jo9ji122s1sa1.gif
 Why should I care?
 Unlike most other fetchers (that are decorative more than anything), Archimede provides information that can be actually consumed and that is relevant to glance at project structures and status in one go. It is quite minimal by design (as it is intended to be unobtrusive); in the latest release I have added support for more architectures via goreleaser, hopefully some others can find it useful too :)!

德国法院已经命令托管服务商 Uberspace 将开源的 YouTube-DL 软件的网站下线。该裁决是由索尼、华纳和环球公司去年提起的版权侵权诉讼的结果，他们称，“YouTube-DL 的服务使用户可以在不付费的情况下翻录流媒体和下载受版权保护的音乐。”。Uberspace 将对判决提出上诉，他们认为，“该命令实际上相当于对 YouTube-DL 的全面禁止，没有考虑到该软件的潜在合法用途。”与此同时，Youtube-DL 的代码仍然可以在 GitHub 上找到。需要提及的是，原始版本的 YouTube-DL 在 GitHub 上的最后一个发布版本是 2021 年底发布的。而一些复刻版本还在继续活跃。

斯坦福大学发布人工智能状况报告

虽然现在人工智能发展之快，让任何与人工智能有关的报告一发布就面临过期的风险，但是我们仍然能从这份 386 页的 报告 中得到一些有用的信息：


在过去的十年里，人工智能的发展已经从学术界主导翻转到了工业界主导，而且这没有改变的迹象。

在传统基准上测试模型正变得困难，这里可能需要一种新的模式。

人工智能训练和使用的能源占用正在变得相当大，但我们还没有看到它如何在其他地方增加效率。

与人工智能相关的技能和工作岗位正在增加，但没有你想象的那么快。

政策制定者们正在努力编写一个明确的人工智能法案，如果有的话，这是一个愚蠢的差事。

投资已经暂时停滞，但这是在过去十年的天文数字般的增长之后。

超过 70% 的中国、沙特和印度受访者认为人工智能的好处多于坏处。美国人呢？35%。



消息来源：Tech Crunch



老王点评：你看出来这些结论哪些不正确或不太正确吗？




采用通用密码的车库门设备

一个市场领先的车库门控制器充满了严重的安全和隐私漏洞。这些设备都采用了相同的容易找到的通用密码来与服务器进行通信，它也会广播未加密的电子邮件地址、设备 ID 以及开关门等信息。估计有超过 4 万台设备受到影响，这些设备位于住宅和商业地产中。任何有一定技术背景的人都可以在设备厂商的服务器上搜索到指定的电子邮件地址、设备 ID 或名称，然后向相关控制器发出指令。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[让我们给你总结一下即将发布的 Debian 12 “Bookworm” 的新功能和改进。


Debian 12 已经开发了几个月了，并且正在慢慢走向最终的发布版本。截止发稿时, 它当前正处于冻结状态下。这意味着预计不会有重大的软件包更改或改进。

这个发布版本带来一些新功能和改进，使其成为 Debian 爱好者期待的一个版本。在这篇文章中，我们将讨论 Debian 12 “Bookworm” 的最好的新功能，以及它们如何使用户受益。

让我们来看看。



Debian 12 “Bookworm” 的新功能和改进

Linux 内核

这个发布版本采用了发布于 2022 年 12 月的 Linux 主线内核 6.1。从时间线上看，到目前为止，Debian 12 的内核版本号只比最新内核落后一个版本。因此，你将通过使用稳定的 Linux 内核 6.1 来获得最新的和最好的硬件支持。

这个内核的亮点功能包括：初步支持 Rust 框架、更新支持英特尔和 AMD 即将推出的 CPU/GPU 系列硬件、改善 Btrfs 和其它文件系统系统的性能等等。

如果你想要了解更多的话，我们已经有一篇关于 内核 6.1 特性 的专题文章。

在安装程序中的非自由软件包

在 Debian 12 中出现了一个与 Debian 的 ISO 文件有关的重大更改。最初，Debian 就分别针对 “自由” 和 “非自由” 软件包提供了不同的 ISO 文件。专有的 “非自由” 软件包是单独的 ISO 文件的一部分。因此，如果你需要针对你的特殊硬件的驱动支持，那么你可以针对你的笔记本/台式机/服务器下载不同的 ISO 文件。

然而，这种体验使终端用户在选择恰当的 Debian 的 ISO 时感到迷惑。为此，Debian 团队去年发起一次社区投票，以选出如何处理 “非自由” 的…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[北京时间4月4日晚间消息，据报道，微软公司联合创始人比尔·盖茨（Bill Gates）今日表示，暂停人工智能（AI）的开发并不能解决该领域未来的挑战。这是自特斯拉CEO埃隆·马斯克（Elon Musk）等上千名科技人士发表公开信，并引发关于人工智能未来的大讨论以来，盖茨首次公开表态。


上周，马斯克等上千名科技人士发表公开信，呼吁暂停训练比GPT-4更强大的人工智能系统。这封公开信称，所有人工智能实验室应立即暂停训练比GPT-4更强大的人工智能系统，至少6个月时间。否则，政府就应该介入采取强制措施。


对此，盖茨今日在接受采访时称，暂停开发并不能真正解决问题。相反，弄清楚如何最优地利用人工智能领域的发展才是硬道理。而且，真正在全球范围内暂停人工智能技术的开发，似乎也不太现实。


盖茨还称：“我认为，要求某一特定群体暂停开发人工智能技术，是无法解决相关挑战的。显然，这些东西很实用。我们需要做的是找出棘手的问题，并加以解决。


当前，虽然盖茨全身心专注于其慈善机构“比尔和梅琳达·盖茨基金会”，但他一直是人工智能的乐观支持者，并将其描述为与互联网或手机一样具有革命性。


3月21日，盖茨还在他的博客GatesNotes上撰文称，人工智能时代已开启，并预测了人工智能将如何改变就业、气候变化、医疗保健和教育等领域。


但随后（上周一），马斯克就给盖茨的这番言论泼冷水。马斯克在推特上称：“我之前曾与盖茨讨论过人工智能，他对这项技术的理解十分有限。直至今日，依然如此。”


其实，马斯克与盖茨长期以来一直就是针尖对麦芒，相互看不上对方。今年2月，盖茨曾表示，他宁愿资助疫苗来拯救生命，也不愿花钱去火星。


他说：“实际上，去火星的花费相当高。相反，你可以购买麻疹疫苗，救一条生命只需1000美元。”盖茨还称，至少到目前为止，马斯克还不是一位伟大的慈善家。


而马斯克也曾表示：“老实说，我和盖茨的对话一直索然无味。”

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[明代中叶以后，随着徽商之崛起以及徽州宗族社会的逐渐形成，一些徽人殚思竭虑地企图改变社会观感，他们力图向世人展示“贾而好儒”“富而好礼”的区域人群新形象。在徽州，不仅通过对民间傩坛祭仪的系统整理，形成了署名为博学之士程敏政编纂的《祈神奏格》那样集大成的“徽礼”文献，而且还参照通行全国的“文公家礼”、《万宝全书》等，编制出适合徽州当地社会生活的各类民间日用类书。其中，清明、中元和冬至时分书写金银袋的做法，也正作为“徽礼”的一部分，积淀而为徽州的重要民俗，并流播四方。而迄今尚存的一些金银袋簿，则具有颇为重要的学术研究价值。
（一）
清明是中国人的传统节日，在“徽礼”盛行的皖南更是备受重视。盛清时代扬州盐商程庭，祖籍徽州府歙县岑山渡，他于康熙五十七年（1718年）返乡展墓寻根，撰有《春帆纪程》一书，其中就指出：“新安最重此节，凡子孙虽至贫乏，亦必先半月前具牲镪，肃衣冠，相聚拜于始祖之墓，而后高、曾、祖、考次第展拜，罔敢紊淆。坟茔自晋、魏、唐、宋以来历历可稽，非若他郡迁徙靡定，不数传而后裔相忘，松楸寂寞，麦饭无人……”

清代宗族清明祭祖图

关于清明时节的具体活动，1931年歙县南乡有位小学生叫凌成锦，他撰有一篇《清明扫墓记》：
清明节者，祭祖之大节也。盖人之也先有上祖，苟无上祖，则无我身矣，故上祖不可不祭之。然祭祀之道，亦不可无定时也，故有时节以祭上祖。吾国定于清明节为祭祖之期，是日无论大学、中学、小学以及各机关、各团体，皆必停止工作，以为扫墓之期。夫吾人祭祖固明矣，然亦不可不诚心以祭之。……孔子曰：“慎终追远，民德归厚矣。”又曰：“祭如在，祭神如神在。”然则圣人如此，岂可轻于祭祖哉！……吾家有清明会，其金银包皆由会内所备……及至墓时，祭器摆于地上，金银包纸一烧，火炮即放，依序拜之。祭毕，遂在坟前休息，听声声炮竹，一似炊烟四起……

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Well this was a major surprise so I figured I’d share it here to get some eyeballs on it.
Essentially, the latest iOS (16.4 at post time) allows your cellular carrier (via eSIM) to add “managed networks” to your device.
These networks cannot be removed, they cannot have “automatically join” disabled, and they have equal priority with your real, personal networks.
So guess what happens when your neighbors get a wifi/modem combo that blasts a free hotspot SSID? Not only does it pollute the already crowded 2.4ghz band, your iPhone will often prefer this connection over your real /local wifi (despite said wifi being at 1 bar).
As of post-time, these is no way to remove these networks short of completely disabling cell service/removing the eSIM and resetting all network settings.
You can see this for yourself by going to WiFi/“edit” and scrolling down.
Edit: to clarify, I can disable “auto join”, but in 4-5 minutes all of my devices have auto-join turned back on. I’m guessing it re-syncs with the carrier profile. Also, this does not seem to be eSIM or SIM related it can happen on both.

Microsoft Excel (not the online one with 30% functionality, the full program). 3DS Max, Substance Painter, Affinity Photo/Designer/Publisher, PDFSam (though there's probably other good software for merging PDFs in Linux already), Unreal Engine, etc.
 The list is pretty extensive. I went through my computer and between work and personal use, there are 17 pieces of software that do not have a Linux version, and since I'm working WITH other people and with plenty of my own old files, I can't just chuck an "alternative" like gimp or inkscape on there. It has to be the actual software.

I figure my first step is to wipe the HD (to eliminate Win OEM as a confounding factor), but all liveusbs hang like this, including Ubuntu Mini, Manjaro minimal, Debian, etc (they work fine on other machines). Note that I went into the BIOS and disabled SecureBoot (which resulted in a predictable fail message to start liveUSBs).
 Online I find suggestions that nvidia drivers may be failing (mostly reddit and manjaro forums), so I'd like to try loading a simple shell and formatting /dev/sda that way. I tried both the open source and proprietary drivers.
 Please let me know if I should be asking this question in a different sub. I've never really been lost like this before.

With the advent of LLMs and their zero-shot/few-shot capabilities, we saw the NLP dev cycle get flipped on its head. Rather than having to hire an army of data labelers and data scientists to fine-tune a BERT model for your use case, engineers can now use LLMs, like GPT-4, to build NLP endpoints in minutes.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi HN, we're Stew and Stefan from Type (https://type.ai/). We're building an AI-first document editor that helps you write. It's similar to Notion, but focused on building a solid authoring experience.
Here’s a general demo: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpK9PWo0lUw
And here’s a demo that includes math and code blocks: https://type.ai/code-math-demos
There are a lot of AI writing products out now, but we've found that most of them treat writing like a one-shot activity that should be delegated to AI. We don't think that's the optimal way to write. We think of great writing as the product of clear thinking, which requires a lot of time tinkering with and refining ideas. So we’re building a user-friendly document editor that puts the author front and center.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[ACM 批评最新的 C 语言标准草案 C23

将于今年发布的 C23 标准带来了一系列新的特性和改变，“使编写安全、正确和可靠的代码变得更容易”。ACM 杂志最近撰文称，新标准的非特性、错误特性和缺陷都足够多和严重，程序员在没有仔细权衡风险和收益的情况下不应该 “升级” —— C23 “把几十年来完全合法的程序变成了燃烧弹”，如 C23 现在宣布 realloc(ptr,0) 为未定义行为。它还批评了 C23 的新的不可达注解，以及它在指针方面缺乏改进。


消息来源：ACM



老王点评：看来这次的 C23 未必能给 C 语言带来更好的发展，而另外一边，Rust 虎视眈眈。




VoIP 公司 3CX 最初以为供应链攻击是误报

VoiP 软件提供商 3CX 遭遇了一次供应链攻击，该公司称收到警告之后在 VirusTotal 上测试了其桌面应用，没发现问题，认为是一次误报。几天后又检查了一下，结果相同。但直到网络安全公司提供了完整细节之后 3CX 才认识到漏洞的情况。3CX 的日活用户高达 1200 万，包括诸多知名公司客户。该事件是自 2020 年 SolarWinds 被攻击和 2021 年 Kaseya 被攻击以来最突出的供应链攻击。


消息来源：The Register



老王点评：即便是这样大的公司，也可能面对供应链攻击会措手不及。




谷歌云端硬盘撤销 500 万文件数量限制

此前，有用户报告，谷歌云端硬盘服务对能储存的文件数量设定了 500 万的数量上限，超过这个限额之后就必须删除旧文件，否则将无法使用。它的最高容量为 30 TB，因此达到 500 万文件数量也是有可能的。这个上限只适用于你在云端硬盘中创建的文件数量，而不是分享到云端硬盘的文件总数。谷歌最初称这一做法是为了“保持强大的性能和可靠性”，有助于防止“滥用”。在听到用户反对之后，谷歌承认这一限制影响到了少部分用户，取消 500 万文件数量限制。


消息来源：The Verge



老王点评：这件事里面最糟糕的是，谷歌在没有征询用户意见和给出更弹性的解决方案时，就实施了限制。]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[《试论诗神》，王炜著，上海文艺出版社2023年1月出版，656页，88.00元

“时代脱了节”，在巨大的震惊之中遭遇父亲鬼魂的哈姆雷特这样说。“时代”与“时间”在time这个词里得到了折叠，它不仅像阿格尼斯·赫勒所说，是历史时间而非宇宙时间，是自然法权与传统继承权之间的角力，同时，也是过去、现在与未来在王子胸中同时震荡的结果（【匈牙利】阿格尼斯·赫勒，《脱节的时代：作为历史哲人的莎士比亚》，吴亚蓉译，华夏出版社，2020，28-29页）。《哈姆雷特》是一个复仇的故事，复仇本身就是过去时间在未来的重影，衔接过去时间与未来时间的，是幽灵的命令、王子的疯癫、捕鼠器的戏中戏，以及哈姆雷特交出叙述的权利之后漫长的沉默——四个“凯洛斯时刻”。而如果挖掘这四个时刻之下幽深的洞穴，一个相互连通的地下世界将可能作为显象剧情的鬼魂而显现，在这里，“复仇”呈现为次要的情节，取而代之的，则是四个时刻共同指向的、对纯洁“丹麦性”的清洗，一种“自我”与“敌人”的辩证法：秩序的重建，最终落在了异邦人小福丁布拉斯的手上。
“四个凯洛斯时刻”，这是王炜在《试论诗神》中对《哈姆雷特》的解读。凯洛斯（Kairos），“时机”，奥登曾将其与钟表时间的准时相对立，认为它“蕴含了准时性的种子，但这种子没有开花”（W. H. Auden, The Dyer’s and Other Essays, New York: Random House, 1948, p.140）。开花的则是时间的潜能：保罗·蒂利希在《历史的诠释》中称之为“时间的实现”（这个定义，也是奥登在《凯洛斯与逻各斯》一诗中借鉴的定义，见Edward Mendelson, Early Auden Later Auden, Princeton: Princeton UP, 1981, 2017, p.489），或者说，在诸多流逝的瞬间之中，那个连通了未来一系…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[北京时间4月5日早间消息，据报道，互联网流量分析服务SimilarWeb的最新测算显示，今年3月共有260万人访问Twitter Blue订阅服务的销售页面，但实际购买人数只有11.6万。


Twitter CEO埃隆·马斯克（Elon Musk）曾经表示，从本月开始，只有Twitter Blue会员可以享受蓝V认证。而在此之前，所有公众人物都可以获得这一待遇。


从3月开始，当通过旧系统获得蓝V认证的用户登录Twitter后，有时会收到系统发来的消息，鼓励他们付费购买Twitter Blue服务，以便保住自己的蓝V认证。


这一变化有望增加Twitter Blue的订阅人数。马斯克最近也决定给部分认证用户更多时间来决定是否付费。


据悉，Twitter Blue今年2月的订户不足30万人。即便考虑到SimilarWeb测算的11.6万的新增订户，总订户也不到Twitter月活跃用户的1%。SimilarWeb的测算并未包括通过手机应用或大宗采购购买Twitter Blue订阅服务的用户。


马斯克表示，Twitter的月活跃用户超过5亿。但他也在上月的推文中表示，Twitter去年10月至今年3月的广告收入已经下滑了50%。


尽管Twitter试图重新获得广告主的青睐，但其中许多并未选择回归。Twitter Blue订阅服务每月收费8美元，其增长速度还不足以覆盖广告收入的下滑。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[3 月 31 日，国产操作系统开源社区 OpenCloudOS 正式发布首个全自研社区 9.0 版本（以下简称 “OC9.0”）。据了解，该版本由腾讯等十余家企业共同开发并长期维护，其内核及用户态软件均为自主选型、独立演进，在操作系统发行版的全链路均实现自主可控。

操作系统等基础软件是信息技术的根基，也是亟需实现突破，掌握更多自主知识产权的关键核心技术领域。

当前，服务器操作系统发行版包含从 L1 到 L3 的不同层级。其中，L1 基于 Linux 内核及核心组件构建，是最上游的“源社区”版本；L2 企业版基于 L1 源社区版本加固，提供企业级的技术支持及服务，可用于真实业务场景，是稳定可靠的发行版本；L3 社区版基于 L2 企业版进一步优化，是代码完全开源、生态全面开放的发行版本。



早在 2010 年，腾讯就已经推出自研操作系统 TencentOS。TencentOS Server 在资源调度弹性、容器支持、系统性能及安全方面均有升级，更适合云环境。目前该操作系统已经覆盖了腾讯所有的业务。

在腾讯操作系统研发逐渐步入成熟的阶段，2021 年，OpenCloudOS 操作系统开源社区正式诞生。腾讯将十余年技术积累悉数投入，成为 OpenCloudOS 的主要发起者和核心技术贡献者。OpenCloudOS 以打造从 L1 到 L3 全覆盖的操作系统发行版为特色，致力于研发自主可控的下一代云原生操作系统，并以社区为依托，建设操作系统开源生态。



OpenCloudOS 社区 TOC（技术监督委员会）主席、腾讯云副总裁郭振宇表示：“从 L1 到 L3 的研发模式是一种完整成熟的操作系统研发模式，只有通过这样的模式，从源头社区切入，才能真正摆脱外部依赖，长期健康发展。”

今年 1 月，L1 源社区的 OpenCloudOS Stream 正式发布，在云原生、稳定性、性能等方面均有支撑，可以全面地支持所有硬件平台，提供自主创新的上游版本。

本次发布的 L3 社区版 OC9.0，是基于 L1 源社区的 OpenCloudOS Stream 优化推出，由腾讯与 Intel、北京红旗、中兴、龙芯、中科方德等二十余家单位共同研发。OC9 使用上游社区最新内核 Linux 6.1，提供多体系架构和新硬件支持，多核性能优化，混部隔离特性增强。同时，MGLRU、Mapple Tree 等特性提升内存管理效率，具备完善的 Cgroup V2 支持、多架构热补丁支持，并提供细致化的调优与系统适配。



除了高性能、安全稳定、支持多硬件平台的特性外，OC9.0 还将为云原生、大数据、人工智能等领域的开发者和用户提供更好的基础环境和服务能力。

开放原子开源基金会业务发展部部长朱其罡表示：“操作系统是数字基础设施的底座，也是推动我国产业数字化、智能化发展的核心力量。在这一过程中，繁荣的开源生态必不可少。我们高兴地看到，OpenCloudOS 在全链路自研方面取得了显著进步，成为研发下一代云原生操作系统的重要力量。未来，基金会将继续助力 OpenCloudOS 操作系统的孵化发展，将其打造成为国际一流开源操作系统社区。”

自 2021 年成立至今，OpenCloudOS 社区成员增长迅速，目前已有 600 余家生态伙伴加入，覆盖操作系统厂商、芯片厂商、整机厂商等 11 大行业和领域。其中超过 60 家企业单位、高校及机构深度参与 OpenCloudOS 社区的共建 ，腾讯、英特尔、中兴、九州云、网迅科技、绿芯、麒麟软件、京东云、宝德、北京红旗、飞腾、浪潮、龙芯中科、OPPO、中科方德、兆芯、清华大学、北京大学等都是社区重要成员。



目前，OpenCloudOS 社区及衍生版本装机量累计超过 1000 万节点，覆盖了银行、保险、证券等 12 大行业，并经历了海量场景长时间的考验。

针对中小企业面临的痛点问题，OpenCloudOS 社区还于近期推出“千百双扶”计划，从迁移服务、生态资源、联盟体系、投资孵化等维度，助力千百家中小企业快速实现国产操作系统的平滑升级和迁移。

未来，OpenCloudOS 社区将继续坚持多元化的技术输入、长期主义的技术路线，助力国产操作系统在开源共建中壮大成长。]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[这是非常重要的、上古的计算机上运行的，古老软件的新版本。




LM-3 项目宣布了 MIT CADR Lisp 机器（Lisp Machine）系统软件的第 100 版，这是它的最后一个版本。它既是一个新的版本，也是一个非常 古老的版本。

前两天，IBM 的 Eric Moore 在 LinkedIn 上发布了关于这个版本的 消息，他帮助了这项恢复工作。该项目的一个更详细的 帖子 描述了这个软件是什么，以及它是从哪里恢复的。

为什么这很重要？好吧，这款软件和它所运行的机器，是一场 “重要战斗” 的标志和纪念物。那场战斗是一场战争的一个阶段：一场以 “针锋相对的方式” 制造计算机的战争。“历史是由胜利者书写的”，温斯顿·丘吉尔 不是 第一个这样说的人。

这场战争和大多数战争一样，是两个 “对手阵营” 之间的战争。一方认为，制造计算机的正确方法是用最好的语言编写最好的软件，如果有必要的话，还要设计精工巧做的计算机来运行这些软件。另一方认为制造计算机的正确方法是制造小而快、容易而简单的软件和硬件，完成大多数人当时需要的工作。

同样，像大多数战争一样，这场战争是漫长而险恶的，双方都有一些肮脏的内斗。最终，有一方取得了决定性的胜利，但已经花了太长的时间，胜利者大多是开始战斗的那些人的后代和亲属。如今，他们甚至根本不记得有这么一场战争，而胜利的一方最终吸收了很多失败一方的想法和技术。最终的结果是，软件并不小而快，也不容易而简单。胜利的一方忘记了他们在战斗，也忘记了与之战斗的对手。

当胜利者忘记他们已经胜利了，也忘记了他们在战斗，这意味着失败者可以写一些最好的战争总结。一篇著名的报道是写自 1991 年的文章，名为《Lisp：好消息，坏消息，如何大获全胜》，其中说：


这两种哲学被称为 “做正确的事（The Right Thing）” 和 “差点则更好…]]></summary>

We’re building a sail the size of a 747 that rolls up into a shipping container. When deployed, it will generate thrust from the wind to reduce the fuel consumption of a cargo ship. An array of these devices will reduce fuel consumption on ships by up to 20%. These sails are easily stowed and removed to cause no interference with cargo operations. Here’s a short video showing our prototype: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VUpVqzpym54.
Sails powered ships for millennia; but then the convenience of energy-dense fuels displaced sails. As ship speeds eventually exceeded wind speeds, the consensus became that sails had no place in shipping and were relegated to hobbyists an…]]></summary>

 Does there exist a zathura-like document viewer that supports highlights and all basic syntax that normal pdf viewers have, but also has the option to export highlights into something like a formatted LaTeX document?
 It would take the highlights, and put them under headers for what chapter they're under in some sort of .md or .tex document, and then compile into their own pdf of notes. 
 Is this redundant or a good idea?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[“pgdatinit” is a kernel which is started by executing “kthread_run()” function (https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v6.3-rc4/source/mm/page_alloc.c#L2284). The kernel thread executes the “deferred_init_memmap()” function (https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v6.3-rc4/source/mm/page_alloc.c#L2108).
 Thus, “pgdatinit” is responsible for initializing memory on every node of the system. For each node a dedicated kernel thread is created with the name pattern “pgdatinit[NodeNumber]” (https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v6.3-rc4/source/mm/page_alloc.c#L2283).
 Overall, the kernel thread is created in case CONFIG_DEFERRED_STRUCT_PAGE_INIT is enabled when compiling the kernel. Which states that initialization of struct pages is deferred to kernel threads (https://cateee.net/lkddb/web-lkddb/DEFERRED_STRUCT_PAGE_INIT.html).
 Lastly, after the initialization flow is finished an information message is sent to the kernel ring buffer (https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v6.3-rc4/source/mm/page_alloc.c#L2177) — as you can see in the image below.

之前我们报道过，某个主流电商应用利用零日漏洞达成不可卸载、窃取用户信息等恶意功能，后被谷歌 下架。此事也被其它安全团队独立 验证。据外媒报道，该公司有上百人负责挖掘安卓漏洞，并利用这些漏洞。最初带有恶意功能的版本只针对农村和小城镇的用户，以避免被发现。通过收集用户活动的大量数据，它得以提供更具有个性化的推送通知和广告，吸引用户打开应用并下单。此事曝光发酵后，该团队被解散，大部分人员被分流。并释出了新的版本移除了漏洞利用代码，但底层代码仍保留在其中。安全专家表示，他们从未看到过一个主流应用会那样做。

上古的 LISP 机系统软件 v100 恢复成功

这是 MIT CADR Lisp 机的系统软件的最后一个版本。因此，这既是一个新的版本，也是一个非常古老的版本。这款软件和它所运行的机器是一场“重要战斗”的标志和纪念物，那场战斗是一场以敌对方式制造计算机的战争。战斗的双方，MIT/斯坦福一方认为，制造计算机的正确方法是用最好的语言编写最好的软件，如果有必要的话，还要设计特殊的花哨的计算机来运行这些软件；新泽西一方认为制造计算机的正确方法是制造小而快、容易和简单的软件和硬件，做大多数人在当时需要的事情。结果我们都知道了，MIT Lisp 机已经湮没在历史中；而胜利方开发出了 Unix 和 C，建立了 RISC、CISC、X86 指令架构，和基于 Algol 的整个语言家族，包括从 BASIC 到 C++ 到 Pascal 到 Go。被恢复的是 MIT CADR Lisp 机的系统软件的最终版本，从备份磁带上花费了十年的时间提取和清理，并使其在 35 年后首次运行。

Tor 合作推出的新浏览器不使用洋葱网络

Tor 项目正在推出一个注重隐私的浏览器 Mullvad 浏览器，它并不是连接到去中心化的洋葱网络。该浏览器的主要目标是使广告商和其他公司更难在互联网上追踪你。默认情况下，该浏览器通过屏蔽元数据，使网站更难对你进行 “指纹” 识别。此外，它还阻止了第三方 Cookie 和跟踪器，并预装了一些插件来进一步减少你的指纹。

老王点评：虽然装插件也可以实现，但是开箱即用还是会方便。只是这种浏览器有时候并不太方便。]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Gedit 是一个好的文本编辑器。用这些技巧、窍门和调整把它变成一个好的代码编辑器。


GNOME 可能已经抛弃了 Gedit 作为默认的文本编辑器，但它仍然是 Linux 老用户的最爱。

它主要是一个文本编辑器，但通过一些调整，它可以作为一个轻量级的代码编辑器使用。

是啊！为什么要用 VS Code 或其他专门的代码编辑器来编写 Bash 脚本或其他语言的简单程序？用 Gedit 也可以过一天。

我将在本文中分享一些我最喜欢的 Gedit 技巧和窍门。虽然大多数的调整对写代码是有益的，但有些对一般的文本写作也是有帮助的。

1、安装插件

可能个别人甚至不知道 Gedit 有强大的插件功能。你可以安装插件来获得额外的功能。

有两种类型的插件：


可以从编辑器菜单中访问的官方 Gedit 插件

第三方插件，可以从项目网站上下载，并放入插件目录中（下面讨论）。


Gedit 插件可以放在 /usr/share/gedit/plugins 或 ~/.local/share/gedit/plugins 目录下。



你可以通过点击 “汉堡包” 菜单，然后打开 “首选项Preferences” 窗口来访问可用和已安装的插件。



首选项窗口有 “插件Plugins” 标签，你可以看到所有可用的插件。你可以使用复选框来启用和禁用这些插件。



2、在侧边栏中显示文件浏览器

如果你正在处理一个有多个文件和文件夹的项目，在侧边栏中用文件浏览器看到所有可用的文件是相当有用的。

进入 “首选项” -> “插件”，启用 “文件浏览器面板File Browser Panel”。



之后，点击右上角的汉堡包菜单，从菜单 “查看View” -> “侧面板Side Panel” 启用侧面板视图。

现在把侧面板视图改为文件浏…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[郭小明

2023年3月10日至19日，中国摄影艺术家郭小明的《墟像·黑锈》个人摄影展在日本大阪Gallery176美术馆公开展出，备受瞩目。
郭小明是1954年生人，自上世纪七十年代拥有第一台相机，便沉迷其中，几十年不改初衷。1980年他离开任教的中学，成为职业摄影师。1985年在威尼斯国际电影节上获奖的电影《高山庙》（戴思杰导演，这是中国第一部在三大电影节获奖的影片），他就是摄影。当然，他主要从事的还是所谓“拍照片”的摄影。
疫情三年，客观上限制了摄影活动的半径。一次偶然路过，郭小明被一片工业废墟吸引。步入其中，映入视线的是巨大建筑的颓败；杂草丛生、砖石塌落，唯有框架耸立。他在惊讶中陷入迷茫，并尝试按下了快门。后来再在电脑上看那些照片时，他感觉自己“有了新的想法——那是不可多得的影像！虽然是独自面对废弃的建筑体，面对锈迹斑斑的设备，面对败于风雨的门窗，却可以感受到曾经存在的蒸汽，曾经存在的腾升，曾经存在的人，在眼前静态里残存的喧闹”。
自2021年年初到2022年年底，两年时间，郭小明的目光和脚步深入到成都周边六个工业废墟，上百次进入，离开，再进入，在人迹罕至的废墟里徘徊，无论寒冬酷暑。他说：冬季有枯枝衬映会产生一种凄美感，夏季有烈日辉映会呈现壮美感。
不同的季节，不同的天气，不同的光线，拍摄数千张照片，呈现不同的景象。他的“内心被一次次触动”，每按下一次快门就会发生一次对话，与时间，空间，锈迹，建筑，空窗。反复的观察和拍摄，逐渐形成独特的画面语言。以艺术的视角和语境记录一段时光，既是历史的子料，也是个性化的艺术作品。
在废墟影像的拍摄中，郭小明最为关注的有三点：一是工业设备在光影中的构成，包括线条的变化、体量的对比、质感的表现、形态的冲突；二是建筑体的构成，包括空间的错落、光影与块面的平衡；三是残破门窗在空间中的独特性，包括其中色彩的褪变和戏剧性的冲突。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[据路透社报道，推特4月1日起宣布逐步关闭传统验证程序，淘汰此前的账号认证系统，取消没有付费的账号的认证标记，并对企业和个人提供不同的认证服务套餐。在美国，企业想要保持“金V”就得每月付1000美元，个人则每月需付8美元（或每年84美元）续上“蓝V”认证。不少美媒拒绝为企业账号和员工账号付费。


美国主流媒体《纽约时报》、《华盛顿邮报》、《洛杉矶时报》纷纷表示，他们不会为其官方推特账户或记者的账户购买推特的Twitter Blue认证服务，因为这项认证不再像以前那样代表着权威和专业。


《纽约时报》发言人表示，将不会为推特的这项服务支付月费，也不会为旗下记者报销个人账户的Twitter Blue费用，“除非在极少数情况下，这种认证状态对报道目的至关重要”。


《纽约时报》拒绝付费引发了马斯克的羞辱和嘲讽。他在推特上说，“他们（《纽约时报》）的推文就像拉肚子，无法阅读”，“如果他们只发自己的头部文章，他们会有更多真正的粉丝”，“《纽约时报》的真正悲剧在于，他们的宣传甚至都不有趣”。


被问及自己当下最青睐的新闻源，马斯克回答道：推特。


他批《纽约时报》“非常虚伪”，称其一方面不买推特的付费认证，一方面又要求读者付费订阅文章。


值得一提的是，在推特发布最新认证规定后，除了《纽约时报》，美国《华盛顿邮报》和《洛杉矶时报》也宣布不会付费维持认证，理由是认证标记不再代表权威性和专业性，只意味着该用户为这个账号交钱了。Buzzfeed和美国政治新闻网“Politico”也通知员工，不会再报销他们的账号认证费用。


另据美国新闻网站“Axios”报道，白宫数字战略总监罗布·弗莱厄蒂（Rob Flaherty）通过电子邮件告诉员工，不会为继续认证账号的工作人员个人账户支付认证费用，他们可以自费购买相关服务。

2022年岁末，我终于读完了《世界一分为二：伍尔夫、T.S.艾略特、E.M.福斯特、D.H.劳伦斯，以及他们的1922年》，该书英文原版于2017年问世，作者是纽约市立大学英文系博士、《纽约时报》网络版书评编辑比尔·戈斯坦（Bill Goldstein），他也为NBC节目“Weekend Today in New York”撰写书评和采访。
要想大概知道全书内容，可以看前言中这段话：
某些年代公认是历史转折点，例如1492年哥伦布发现新大陆、1776年美国独立、1965年美军出兵越南。至于1922年，则是文学史上的分水岭。《世界一分为二》聚焦于1922年四位传奇作家的故事，包括伍尔夫、T. S. 艾略特、E. M. 福斯特、D. H. 劳伦斯，在那不凡的年代，四位作家因缘际会与时共感，创造出了明日的语言。 
“1922年前后，是文坛的分水岭。”这句引领全书的文字，来自薇拉·凯瑟的作品《未满四十请勿看》。1922年2月2日，乔伊斯四十岁生日，他的现代主义长篇小说《尤利西斯》单行本也正在这天由巴黎的莎士比亚书店出版。1922年10月15日，诗人艾略特名作《荒原》在《标准》（The Criterion）杂志面世，而艾略特的三十五岁生日，是在几周前的9月26日。《尤利西斯》与《荒原》的出版，正是使得1922年成为现代主义元年的两件标志性大事。《世界一分为二》这本书的最后一页这样回顾1922年之于世界文学历史的意义：

在本指南中，我们将逐步演示如何在 Ubuntu 22.04 LTS 上安装 CRI-O。

先决条件

在开始之前，这是你需要的：


具有 SSH 访问权限的 Ubuntu 22.04 实例

在实例上配置的 sudo 用户

快速稳定的互联网连接


有了这个，让我们开始吧。

步骤 1：更新系统并安装依赖

立即登录你的服务器实例，并按如下方式更新包列表：

$ sudo apt update


更新本地包索引后，按如下方式安装依赖项：

$ sudo apt install apt-transport-https ca-certificates curl gnupg2 software-properties-common -y


步骤 2：添加 CRI-O 存储库

要安装 CRI-O，我们需要在 Ubuntu 上添加或启用它的仓库。但首先，你需要根据操作系统和要安装的 CRI-O 版本定义变量。

因此，定义如下变量：

$ export OS=xUbuntu_22.04
$ export CRIO_VERSION=1.24


完成后，运行以下命令集以添加 CRI-O Kubic 仓库：

$ echo "deb https://download.opensuse.org/repositories/devel:/kubic:/libcontainers:/stable/$OS/ …]]></summary>

 i got a new monitor with no sound when my other one did. The problem is that i record gameplay videos using a capture card that does passthough with another pc. But for the audio to work, The computer i'm playing with needs to select the hdmi as the sound option for sound to appear in the recording. But it doesnt show up as an audio source because it doesnt have speakers. Anyone know any trick i can do to make a fake audio source on the hdmi?
 The pc i am trying to play with is the Linux Steam deck
 The moniter in question is the Acer SSB20Q
 The capture card is the Avermedia 2 plus live gamer portable

        <link href="https://donuts-are-good.github.io/shhhbb/"/>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello all :) I made this BBS for fun and thought you all would enjoy it. It's not perfect, but it's been a fun exercise!
see it: https://asciinema.org/a/Emg6SWrXMV6cehfQxrw1GRu75
try it:
    ssh -p 2223 shhhbb.com

https://github.com/donuts-are-good/shhhbb/releases/latest
why?
Every year I challenge myself in some new way, this year it is to push one project per week. You might recognize my static site generator [0] or my releaser for go [1] from previous posts as one of these weekly projects. If you want to join me in doing this, it's been a blast and I highly recommend it! Maybe we can chat on the bbs about it :)
[0] - bearclaw tiny static generator - https://github.com/donuts-are-good/bearclaw
[1] - release.sh release builder for go - https://github.com/donuts-are-good/bearclaw
need:
I'd love a few co-conspirators, or even some new friends for the bbs software or the bbs itself. A lofty nice-to-have goal is meeting a few other similarly motivated people to conspire with on a weekly basis. If that's you, drop me a line!
goals:
I have about half of an admin interface endpoint pushed up, which I'd like to finish. I realized mid-commit that I'd lacked some other material in a previous commit, and in pushing it up, I ended up pushing half the admin feature. Stay tuned for that.
I'd also like to implement a feature where I surrender the socket to a new process so I can upgrade the binary without dropping all of the connected users. I'm not sure on the feasibility of this, but all the words fit together, so it'll be tried.

Valve 刚刚公布了 2023 年 3 月的 Steam 调查结果，这些初步数字显示 Linux 游戏市场份额下降了 0.54%，使整个 Linux 游戏人口只占 Steam 客户群的 0.84% 左右。而 2 月份的数据为 1.27%。Steam Deck 仍在疯狂销售，所以看到如此大的月度环比跌幅令人惊讶。不过，3 月份数据显示简体中文用户跃升了 27%，现在占 Steam 上整体游戏客户群的 51%。这也是一个非常令人吃惊的数据。如果这一数据准确的话，倒是能说明 Linux 用户群份额降低的原因。

老王点评：Steam 报告的数据不是第一次出错了，希望是又一次数学没学好，毕竟这数据有点匪夷所思了。




人工智能政策小组称，FTC 应阻止 OpenAI 推出新的 GPT 模型

人工智能和数字政策中心（CAIDP）今天提出投诉，要求美国联邦贸易委员会（FTC）调查 OpenAI 违反消费者保护规则的行为，认为 OpenAI 推出的人工智能文本生成工具 “有偏见，有欺骗性，并对公共安全构成风险”。CAIDP 认为，GPT-4 越过了伤害消费者的界限，应该引起监管行动。在投诉中，CAIDP 要求 FTC 停止任何进一步的 GPT 模式的商业部署，并要求在未来推出任何模式之前对其进行独立评估。FTC 已经表达了对人工智能工具的监管兴趣。

老王点评：这是什么盘外招都使出了啊。




谷歌再次暂停废弃 Manifest V2

早在 2018 年 11 月，谷歌就以安全、隐私和性能等既定理由要修改 Chrome 浏览器扩展 API，即 Manifest V2。鉴于它很容易被滥用，允许开发人员创建占用资源的扩展，也不是特别适合于移动设备，谷歌在新推出的 Manifest V3 删除了一些 API，但这导致广告拦截等扩展不能工作或需要修改工作方式。根据统计，去年底，大约有 13.6 万个扩展仍然在 MV2 下运行，而大约有 3 万个扩展依赖 MV3 代码。谷歌已经屡次推迟废弃 MV2 的计划，最近一次承诺在 3 月修订该指南，但目前已再次推迟，并且没有明确的时间表。


消息来源：The Register



老王点评：新的 API 或许有更好的地方，但是既有的扩展生态带来的反弹可能超乎了谷歌的预料。]]></summary>

最近几个月，以ChatGPT为代表的聊天机器人引起全世界的广泛关注。GPT是如何工作的？它会有自我意识吗？人工智能将对我们的社会、文化、知识系统造成何种冲击和重构？奇点到了吗？未来人类有能力与人工智能“抗衡”吗？《上海书评》特邀亚马逊云科技上海人工智能研究院院长、上海纽约大学计算机系终身教授张峥和作家小白对谈，讨论人工智能的训练方式及其在未来的可能走向。
小白：首先要请你介绍一下GPT这类预训练大模型的算法工作原理，贝叶斯、计算网络、思维链，诸如此类，把这些专业知识一次性简单介绍一下，然后我们就离开这些术语，讨论一下这个突然之间降临的人工智能可能会对我们的社会、文化、知识系统造成的冲击和重构。
张峥：GPT的基础是大语言模型，这些大模型本质上在训练的时候是在做接龙游戏——把下一页书给写出来——但它们有两点是远超人类的，第一是海量阅读，第二是其中有百分之十的数据是非常结构化的代码（以及代码周围的注释）。大致的结果就是模型中既存了知识（更准确的说是知识的碎片），又存了勾连知识碎片的逻辑，参数上大概是二比一这个样子。举例说，“着火了，赶紧跑”，这个动作的顺序是逻辑，“火”和“跑”是知识。我认为在大模型里面不存在纯粹脱离知识的逻辑，也不存在不被某种逻辑连带的知识，这两个加起来就是一个所谓世界模型（World Model）的雏形。这是一个大致准确的描述，大模型内部具体是如何工作的，学界都还没有一个定论。
小白：我们很多作家一开始心里有点慌，觉得能替代人类作家的机器来了，饭碗要被砸了。后来上机器一试，发觉一大堆车轱辘话，有些甚至是瞎扯，心里就有点笃定了。我想他们可能没有理解：一个能够准确预测“下一个字”是什么的机器，其实是对整个世界了如指掌了。那不仅是让机器吃下去一大堆文本，然后让它重新组合的事。是通过训练机器预测下一个字，训练它理解世界，理解人类的想法。就写作…]]></summary>

 I own a small tech blog called https://notatether.com, where I focus on cool stuff inside Windows, Linux, and the internet (and occasionally MacOS), as well as apps written for all of those.
 I'd like to interview people around here on what their all-time favorite Linux distro release was and why., so I can feature them on my website. Expect me to ask a lot of questions about your software/hardware setup as well as what you do with your Linux machines running that distro.
 If you're interested, reply here with your favorite distro and some short context, then go to my website and fill out the contact form with your experience running that distro (and other distros), and I'll promptly get back to you by email.
 I think it will be a win-win for everyone; you guys will get a(nother) platform, and I'll become more well known.

当 systemd 刚问世时，有很多关于它能加快启动时间的消息。这项功能对大多数人都有吸引力（对那些不重启的人来说就不那么重要了），所以在很多方面，这也是它今天仍然拥有的声誉。虽然 systemd 确实是在启动过程中并行启动服务起到了作用，但它的作用远不止于此。以下是你可能没有意识到 systemd 可以做的三件事，但你应该好好利用。

1、简化 Linux ps

如果你曾经使用过 ps，甚至只是 top 命令，那么你就会知道你的电脑一直都在运行数百个进程。有时，这正是你需要的信息，以便了解你的计算机或其用户在做什么。其他时候，你真正需要的是一个总体的概览。

systemd-cgtop 命令提供了一个基于控制组cgroup任务安排的计算机负载的简单视图。控制组 对现代 Linux 很重要，基本上是容器和 Kubernetes 的底层支持结构（这也是云计算可以扩展的原因），但它们也是家庭电脑上的有用结构。例如，从 systemd-cgtop 的输出中，你可以看到用户进程的负载，而不是系统进程：

Control Group               Proc+   %CPU   Memory  Input/s Output/s

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[近日，迪士尼宣布启动7000人的裁员计划，第一轮裁员本周就将启动。作为迪士尼旗下著名的流媒体平台，Hulu也未能幸免，虽然该平台并未正式在中国推出其视频流媒体服务，但却在中国设有研发中心，为美国市场提供技术支持和创新。


流媒体巨头裁员，知情人士：规模或超90%


据21世纪经济报道，自多方了解到，Hulu北京启动裁员。也有知情人士称，本次Hulu北京裁员规模超过90%。


资料显示，作为美国流媒体巨头，Hulu由美国国家广播环球公司和福克斯共同成立于2007年，总部位于美国洛杉矶，并在包括洛杉矶、纽约、芝加哥、北京等地设有共计8个办公室及研发中心。


其中，北京是仅次于总部的全球第二大研发中心，也是Hulu在全球最早建立的办公点之一。自2007年Hulu北京成立以来，其团队规模从不到10人已经发展至约200名员工规模。


据Hulu官网介绍，Hulu北京主要包括技术研发及产品团队。除北京之外，Hulu全球研发及产品团队还涉及圣莫妮卡（Santa Monica）、西雅图（Seattle）等地。


根据21世纪经济报道记者查询，目前Hulu官方已没有在华招聘职位。有消息称，此次Hulu裁员补偿为N+3。


一位知情人士表示，Hulu在华以技术人员居多，且“招聘标准非常高，程序员非常多清北（毕业的人）”、“找工作肯定没问题，但被裁了还是蛮唏嘘的”。


据Hulu官网介绍，截至2023年2月，Hulu在美付费用户达到4800万人，平台影视剧超过7万，直播频道超过85个。


据华尔街日报30日报道，迪士尼在北京裁减逾300名专注于流媒体业务的员工，为该集团削减成本和重组举措的一部分。据悉受裁员影响的是为迪士尼流媒体业务开发个性化、搜寻和客户识别等功能的技术员工。迪士尼在声明中表示，在中国的裁员行动是该公司削减成本和全球重组的一部分。


和迪士尼近期的裁员计划有关


华尔街日报的报道表明，Hulu此次裁员，和其控股股东迪士尼近期启动的裁员计划有关。


此前，2019年3月，迪士尼通过收购21世纪福克斯资产加持了其Hulu股权；5月，迪士尼和康卡斯特（Comcast）共同宣布，迪士尼将从后者手中获得Hulu的“全面运营控制权”。根据协议，康卡斯特可以选择在5年后，以至少275亿美元的估值将名下33%的Hulu股权出售给迪士尼。


新冠疫情爆发后，为了应对疫情带来的危机，迪士尼开始了一系列的调整和重组。2022年10月份，迪士尼宣布将其媒体和娱乐业务进行重组，将更多的资源和重心放在流媒体服务上。


2023年3月份，迪士尼宣布了一轮裁员计划，涉及7000名员工，主要来自其电视、电影和流媒体业务。


迪士尼公司首席执行官鲍勃·艾格（Bob Iger）27日表示，7000人的裁员计划将分成三轮进行，第一轮本周启动，首批被裁的员工将在接下来的四天内收到通知。第二轮裁员将于4月份实施，涉及人数会比第一轮更多。第三轮裁员，预计将在春末夏初完成。


除此之外，迪士尼的流媒体业务近年来遇到不小的挫折，这或许也是Hulu收缩的原因之一。


据财报显示，去年第四季度迪士尼媒体与娱乐业务线营收147.76亿美元，同比仅增长1%，经营亏损为1000万美元。另外，Disney+首次出现订阅用户下降，有240万订阅用户流失，数量远高于预期。


但2018年到2022年，迪士尼内容总投入高达1144亿美元，而在此期间，迪士尼总营收是3446亿美元。迪士尼在流媒体上投入的金额占这些年总营收的33.2%，也就是说，迪士尼拿出了三分之一的营收去贡献给流媒体业务，却并未获得相应的利润。


Hulu在中国面临的市场竞争和监管也可能是其裁员的原因之一。


Hulu虽然在美国拥有较高的市场份额和用户基数，但在中国却没有正式推出其视频流媒体服务。Hulu在中国主要以技术研发为主，为美国市场提供技术支持和创新。


然而，在中国的视频流媒体市场上，Hulu面临着众多强劲的竞争对手，如爱奇艺、腾讯视频、优酷等。这些平台不仅拥有庞大的用户群和内容库，还拥有强大的本土化能力和营销策略。Hulu要想在中国市场上获得一席之地，需要付出巨大的成本和投入，并且面临着不确定的收益和风险。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[张峥、小白（章静绘）

最近几个月，以ChatGPT为代表的聊天机器人引起全世界的广泛关注。GPT是如何工作的？它会有自我意识吗？人工智能将对我们的社会、文化、知识系统造成何种冲击和重构？奇点到了吗？未来人类有能力与人工智能“抗衡”吗？《上海书评》特邀亚马逊云科技上海人工智能研究院院长、上海纽约大学计算机系终身教授张峥和作家小白对谈，讨论人工智能的训练方式及其在未来的可能走向。
小白：首先要请你介绍一下GPT这类预训练大模型的算法工作原理，贝叶斯、计算网络、思维链，诸如此类，把这些专业知识一次性简单介绍一下，然后我们就离开这些术语，讨论一下这个突然之间降临的人工智能可能会对我们的社会、文化、知识系统造成的冲击和重构。
张峥：GPT的基础是大语言模型，这些大模型本质上在训练的时候是在做接龙游戏——把下一页书给写出来——但它们有两点是远超人类的，第一是海量阅读，第二是其中有百分之十的数据是非常结构化的代码（以及代码周围的注释）。大致的结果就是模型中既存了知识（更准确的说是知识的碎片），又存了勾连知识碎片的逻辑，参数上大概是二比一这个样子。举例说，“着火了，赶紧跑”，这个动作的顺序是逻辑，“火”和“跑”是知识。我认为在大模型里面不存在纯粹脱离知识的逻辑，也不存在不被某种逻辑连带的知识，这两个加起来就是一个所谓世界模型（World Model）的雏形。这是一个大致准确的描述，大模型内部具体是如何工作的，学界都还没有一个定论。
小白：我们很多作家一开始心里有点慌，觉得能替代人类作家的机器来了，饭碗要被砸了。后来上机器一试，发觉一大堆车轱辘话，有些甚至是瞎扯，心里就有点笃定了。我想他们可能没有理解：一个能够准确预测“下一个字”是什么的机器，其实是对整个世界了如指掌了。那不仅是让机器吃下去一大堆文本，然后让它重新组合的事。是通过训练机器预测下一个字，训练它理解世界，理解人类的想法。就写作…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[One big worry I have is that most Linux app developers are not getting paid. If they can't make a living, I fear they will have to abandon their projects in the long run. What a shame.
 We, the Linux users, NEED to embrace the idea of "giving back/donating". You get all this stuff you love for free. So - if you can - then why not give a little donation?
 By doing this, you will strengthen the dev team of your favorite apps, thus ensuring a higher quality product in the future.
 With this in mind, I am planning to add a "Donate" function for each app downloaded in the Software Center in Kumander Linux.
 The economy will be something like this:
 5% goes to Kumander Linux dev team, ensuring the further development of the OS
 25% is shared between all developers whos app was recently downloaded, but did not get a donation
 70% goes straight to the developer of the app being donated towards
 It's a win/win/win folks.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ubuntu Unity 的负责人提出了一个新的发行版，听起来像是每个人都可能想要关注的东西。




听起来太牵强了？

好吧，blendOS 把自己定位为发行版的终极杂拌。

blendOS 是 Rudra Saraswat 的一个新项目，他以基于 Ubuntu 的合成版而闻名，特别是 Ubuntu Unity（现在是官方的 Ubuntu 风味版）。

我想说的是，这个项目有一个非常准确的名字来表达它想要实现的目标。

但是，blendOS 的目标是如何成为所有人的替代品？它到底是什么？

blendOS 不只是又一个 Linux 发行版



blendOS 是一个基于 Arch 的发行版，它支持每种类型的应用程序包。

如果你了解过 carbonOS 和 Vanilla OS，你应该对这类发行版中的一些共同点有了了解。

其中之一是，不可变性，意思是，操作系统的核心/基础保持不变，给你带来增强的安全性，以及更简单和可靠的更新。

同样，blendOS 也有以下的关键亮点：


不可变操作系统

支持多个软件包管理器，包括 Apt、DNF、Yum、Pacman 和 Yay

支持多种桌面环境

Flathub 商店桌面应用


blendOS 使用 Jade GUI（来自 Crystal Linux 的安装程序）来提供一个无缝的安装体验。而且，Flathub 商店可以直接安装应用程序，而不是像人们想象的那样下载 Flatpakref文件。

为了使所有的发行版的软件包都能正常工作，blendOS 使用其软件包管理器 blend。

你仍然可以通过 Arch 容器在命令行使用 Pacman。

此外，它还支持，T2 Mac，即 2018 年后生产的英特尔 Mac。因此，如果你想在你已经拥有的设备上做实验，blendOS 应该可以使用。


🚧 截至目前，该项目还处于早期发展阶段。


预计一些直接的变化包括：




用 Podman 代替 Distrobox 的实现

一个新的 GUI 配置工具，支持管理覆盖层和容器


所以，是的，你现在看到的东西可能会有变化。然而，它仍然是听起来令人激动的东西。

你可以在其 官方博客文章 中阅读其计划中的变化，并在其 GitHub 页面中探索 blendOS。


blendOS


你对 blendOS 有什么看法？它值得关注吗？请在评论中告诉我！

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello everyone,
I am the founder of a blogging platform called Feather.so.
People can sign up and create their own blogs using Feather.
Now, with OpenAI releasing their API, they made using AI so accessible for someone like me. So I wanted to add a chatbot functionality to my customer blogs. Basically, I wanted to automatically create a chatbot for each of my customer blogs. That chatbot will be trained on the content on their blog.
When I set out to do this using Open AI, I thought I could do this for every website, not just for my customer blogs.
So I ended up creating an entirely new product called SiteGPT.ai so that it can be used on any website.
The workflow works like this. People login the platform, they enter their website url, and click on a button to start training. Then I start creating a chatbot and train the chatbot will all the content on the website that the user enters.
That chatbot now knows everything about that website. It can answer any questions related to that website.
I have also added a demo chatbot at the bottom right of the sitegpt.ai website. That chatbot is trained on the content of SiteGPT.ai. So it can answer any questions related to its own website.
Please try it out and let me know if you have any feedback. I am also happy to take any other technical questions you may have.
Thanks.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[当前，数字化转型已成各行各业稳发展的“必答题”，对于站在数字化转型潮头浪尖的金融行业来说更是如此。而在技术选择上，因为应用形态与基础设施交替发展，将 IT 基础设施再一次带到十字路口。基础设施经历了虚拟化、云平台，直至容器技术在过去五年普及。另一方面，应用的架构从单体架构，到复杂度提升之后早期主流的三层架构，应用软件变得越来越复杂。

一、容器云成为银行业云原生建设基础

近期《金融电子化》杂志社发布了《银行业私有云建设发展报告》，共有 129 家银行业金融机构参与调研。报告通过汇集行业上百家金融机构科技决策者在云计算建设应用过程中的经验，总结提炼了金融云技术的应用现状、发展趋势以及建设使用中的关注点，对于同行业以及所有的云计算行业从业者来说都非常值得借鉴和参考。

报告中也提到了容器云的应用现状与趋势，有近 1/3 的银行进行了容器云建设。



但是在建设的银行中，已经有 2/3 完成了建设，并且半数银行已经覆盖渠道类和业务类等系统。容器云有利于统一软件交付和运维的模式，从而更好地支撑以互联网业务为代表的敏态业务创新需求。





因此，银行容器云建设比私有云更为积极，32% 的银行选择了本着“能上尽上”的原则。



从应用形态上，新业务尽可能的开始部署在具备容器能力的平台上，同时这些业务也具备了敏捷，快速迭代的特点。

从组织架构上，银行业的 90% 客户都将“容器云”的规划放到规划重点上来，由于云计算平台的规划既要解决业务开发的问题，同时也要解决运维的问题，所以牵头部门无论是开发部还是运维部，都需要一体化的考虑容器能力的建设与方向。

在架构形态上，除了容器化所带来的更加平滑的升级能力、自动化的应用发布以及更为标准化的中间件管理能力之外，“为满足信创要求而必须考虑的“‘一云多芯’能力，支持信创平台建设与应用迁移”能力关注度为 74.5%。…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[如果你想要制作一个网站，但又不想暴露自己的身份和信息，那么你可能需要采用一些匿名制作网站的方法。常见的制作方法和思路是，使用免费邮箱、网站空间和域名，结合起来搭建一个网站。尽可能不要使用手机和支付系统，下面笔者就介绍一下具体的制作步骤。


先进行身份隔离，注册一个全新的Gmail邮箱账号，增加APP的两步验证，不要绑定手机号，不要用这个邮箱注册任何国内服务，注册的服务越少越好，这样可以保证这个邮箱不会被轻易追踪或者泄露。


用该Gmail邮箱开通一个Google Blogger，即可开通博客网站。Blogger是Google提供的免费博客平台，用户可以在上面发布想要分享的内容，也可以选择不同的模板和主题来美化网站，并且没有广告，是一个非常优秀的免费网站空间。


做为网站来说，域名通常不可缺少，免费域名一般不太可靠，因此大多数情况还要购买域名。Cloudflare是一个提供域名和CDN服务的平台，可以使用之前注册的Gmail邮箱在Cloudflare注册和购买域名，然后将域名解析到Blogger网站上，这样你就拥有了一个独立的网址，通过这个独立网址即可访问搭建在Blogger上的网站。


使用Gmail箱注册Paypal进行支付。Paypal是一个提供在线支付和转账服务的平台，可以用它来购买或者接收一些付款，而不需要暴露银行卡或者信用卡信息。


不要和任何人进行任何合作，对外联系只用Gmail，一切事情自己搞定。这样可以避免被别人利用或者出卖，也可以减少被发现或者被举报的风险。


不要在第三方客户端登录Gmail，只在Web端登录，小心木马邮件。这样可以防止邮箱被盗取或者被植入恶意软件，也可以避免被监控或者被拦截。


如果网站遇到网络攻击，开启Cloudflare的WAF（Web应用防火墙）进行防御。WAF可以帮助站长抵御一些常见的网络攻击，如SQL注入、跨站脚本、DDoS等。


除了上面提到的网络服务之外，不要用该邮箱注册其他网络服务。这样可以减少你在网络上留下的痕迹，也可以避免被其他服务泄露或者出售你的信息。另外，全部服务都不要添加手机号码，也不要使用手机注册、访问和使用，手机是最不安全的设备之一，能不用就不用。手机的唯一作用就是，安装和使用Google Authenticator（Google身份验证器）。


以上就是匿名制作网站的思路和方法，供大家参考。]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So, last night for the heck of it, I did a base install of Arch Linux in a VM. Took me about 25-30 minutes.
 Anyway, while in Virtualbox, I noticed I had a few VMs still in there that I'd already installed but haven't used them in a while (6-8 months at least). So I decided to update them last night and today. I like having them around so I can take a look at things if I need to. They're kinda handy that way.
 I'm finding that pretty much all of them needed to have the mirrors updated because the ones I was using are no longer working. You might see an error come up saying something about a certain IP (something like 65.120.45.6 is unreachable) not being reachable. All you need to do is just go into your mirrors and select new ones. It's pretty easy in Mint (working on that VM right now) and I'm sure any Debian based system should be just as easy to fix. A Mirrors window popped up and allowed me to select newer, faster mirrors. Once I did that, I was able to get Mint updated
 In my Arch VMs (base Arch and ArcoLinux) I needed to update the keyrings. To do that you'll use sudo pacman -Sy archlinux-keyring. This updates all of your keys and should make updating an old Arch based Linux system pretty easy to update after that.
 And that should do it for Debian based and Arch based systems. That's all I use in my VMs. 
 If anyone has any other methods for updating your older VMs you haven't touched in a while like Gentoo, NIXos, Suse, or anything else, please let us know what you do to fix any mirror update issues.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Twitter 公开推荐算法源代码，马斯克获特别优待

Twitter 终于如约 公开 了推荐算法源代码，源代码 托管在 GitHub 上，采用 AGPLv3 许可证。推荐算法控制着出现在 “For You” 中的推文，利用机器学习模型进行排名，过滤掉不良推文和已屏蔽用户的推文等，最后展示到用户的时间线。该代码仓库迅速获得了数十万星标。在代码中，用户发现埃隆·马斯克被专门标出。上个月马斯克的推文曾一度 展示 给几乎所有 Twitter 用户。代码的注解声称这些标签只是用于数据收集的目的。对于这一发现，马斯克本人在 Twitter 上表示将会移除，声称他也是才知道。


消息来源：Ars Technica



老王点评：这是我对马斯克入主 Twitter 之后所做的事情中唯一赞赏的，或许这会带来一个所谓的 “Twitter 2.0”。今天早上我在朋友圈嘲讽道，某个国内的山寨品怕是都不敢用 Twitter 开源出来的算法来改善自己的算法，因为他们的算法是 “MONEY”。




Midjourney 由于新用户过多而暂停免费试用

AI 图像生成服务 Midjourney 已经停止了其服务的免费试用。人们最初认为暂停的原因是，有人利用 Midjourney v5 生成的 AI 图像在社交网络病毒式传播，如前总统特朗普被捕和罗马天主教教皇身穿时尚夹克的照片，让很多人信以为真。但 Midjourney CEO 表示暂停原因是免费用户流量过大，试用遭滥用。他们认为“罪魁祸首可能是中国的一个病毒式的操作视频”和“暂时的 GPU 短缺”。并指出，Midjourney 的免费试用版从未包括访问 Midjourney 最新的第 5 版，而该版本可创建最真实的图像，并被认为是用于这些病毒图片。


消息来源：The Verge



老王点评：看看，其实不是被玩坏了，而是太受欢迎了。




电子游戏行业盛会 E3 2023 取消

今年的电子娱乐博览会（E3）已经被取消了。娱乐软件协会（ESA）和展会发起人 ReedPop 周四晚些时候宣布，计划中的 6 月活动“没有从主要出版商和潜在与会者那里获得必要的持续兴趣”，以证明大规模会议的合理性。这本来该是自 2019 年后第一次现场的 E3 大展。但所有三个主要的游戏机制造商已经确认他们不会参加，而主要的出版商育碧和世嘉最近也公开放弃了这个展会。


消息来源：Ars Technica



老王点评：真是见证了一个时代的落幕，而三年的大流行只是加速了这个过程。]]></summary>

Tekton 是一个用于创建持续集成和持续交付（CI/CD）系统的 Kubernetes 原生开源框架。通过对底层实施细节的抽象，它还可以帮助你在多个云供应商或企业内部系统中进行端到端（构建、测试、部署）应用开发。

Tekton 介绍

Tekton 最初被称为 Knative Build，后来被重组为独立的开源项目，有自己的 治理组织，现在是属于 Linux 基金会 的项目。Tekton 提供了一个集群内的容器镜像构建和部署工作流程，换句话说，它是一个 持续集成continuous integration（CI）和 持续交付continuous delivery（CD）服务。它由 Tekton 流水线和几个支持组件如 Tekton CLI、Triggers 和 Catalog 等组成。

Tekton 是一个 Kubernetes 原生应用。它在 Kubernetes 集群中作为扩展被安装和运行，由一套Kubernetes 定制化资源组成，定义了你为流水线创建和复用的构建块。由于 Tekton 是一种 Kubernetes 原生技术，所以它非常容易扩展。当你需要增加你的工作负载时，你只需向你的集群添加节点就可以了。由于其可扩展的设计和社区贡献的组件库，它也很容易定制。

对于需要 CI/CD 系统来开展工作的开发人员，和为其组织内的开发人员建立 CI/CD 系统的平台工程师，Tekton 是理想选择。

Tekton 组件

构建 CI/CD 流水线的过程非常复杂，因此 Tekton 为每一步都提供工具。以下是 Tekton 提供的主要组件：

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[你一定已经听说过著名的 Vim 文本编辑器。然而，这篇文章是关于它的复刻 Neovim。


Vim 也是 Vi 的一个复刻，这使得 Neovim 成为复刻的复刻。所以，你最终可以使用任何东西，因为它有一些独特的特征。

如果你决定使用 Neovim，让我帮助你在 Ubuntu 和其他 Linux 发行版上开始使用它。

Neovim 概述



Neovim 是一个以其简单的维护和社区贡献而闻名的项目。此外，开发工作很好地分配在多个开发人员之间。

对于最终用户而言，Neovim 的可扩展性远超人们的预期。Neovim 的目标是在不损害 Vim 传统功能的情况下提供更好的应用。

使用 Neovim 的 GUI，你可以获得增强的编辑体验。

Neovim 的特点

虽然你可以在其官方网站及其 GitHub 页面 上探索所有相关信息。让我强调一些特点：


现代图形界面

从多种语言访问 API，包括（C/C++、C#、Go、Haskell、Java/Kotlin、JavaScript/Node.js、Lua、Perl、Python、Ruby、Rust 等等）

嵌入式、可编写脚本的终端仿真器

异步任务控制

多个实例之间的共享数据

XDG 基本目录支持

与大多数 Vim 插件兼容，包括 Ruby 和 Python 插件



💡 我们建议你在开始使用 Vim 和 Neovim 之前，先了解其用法。


在 Ubuntu 和 Linux 上安装 Neovim

由于 Neovim 的流行，安装它很简单。因为 Neovim 在你选择的任何发行版的官方仓库中都可用。


如果你需要，我们还有一个 在 Linux 上安装 Vim 的指南。


要在 Ubuntu 上安装 Neovim，只需单击停靠区中的 Ubuntu 软件图标。然后，搜索 Neovim。你可以根据自己的喜好选择 Snap 或 deb 版本。但是，deb 包版本是过时的 Neovim 版本。



如果你不想要 Snap 版本，你可以从 Neovim 的 Github 发布页 获取最新的 deb 文件。如果你仔细查看发布页面，还有一个 Appimage 文件。

如果你想使用终端而不是 GUI，你可以执行以下操作：

对于基于 Ubuntu 和 Debian 的发行版，输入以下命令进行安装：

sudo apt install neovim


对于 Manjaro 和 Arch Linux，使用以下命令更新你的系统并安装 Neovim：

sudo pacman -Syu neovim


对于 Fedora，使用以下命令：

sudo dnf install -y neovim


要安装 Flatpak，你可以使用此命令：

flatpak install flathub io.neovim.nvim


最后，要安装 Snap 包，请使用以下命令：

sudo snap install nvim --classic


如果你更喜欢从源代码构建软件，请遵循该项目的 Github 页面上给出的 步骤。

如何使用 Neovim

要在安装完成后使用 Neovim，只需从应用菜单启动它，方法是按超级键并输入 neovim。这将打开一个带有 Neovim 的终端窗口。



或者你可以打开你选择的任何终端仿真器并输入以下命令：

nvim


是的，不是 neovim，而是 nvim。例如，要编辑 /etc/fstab，请输入以下命令：

sudo nvim /etc/fstab


现在 fstab 文件将被打开，如下面的截图所示：



如果你无法退出编辑器，请不要担心，按下 Shift+Z+Z。例如，如果此快捷键令人困惑，请使用你需要的键在任何文本编辑器中输入大写的 ZZ 就明白了。

关于这一点，我应该重申，你需要学习 Vim 或 Neovim 并阅读文档才能有效地利用其所有功能。

总结

The error is under this link: https://www.parrotsec.org/docs/configuration/nvidia-drivers#install-the-driver-from-the-official-nvidia-website where you add the lines to the blacklist file and the first line says "nouveau blacklist" instead of "blacklist nouveau".

谈到大豆，大概不少人都知道这样一种反差：它是一种“祖籍”中国的作物，在历史上，还有个更加古老的雅号叫做“菽”。然而，在当下世界，美洲却已成为全球最大的大豆产出地，而美国的大豆产量则居于世界第一位——是排名第二的巴西的两倍。这种局面是怎样形成的？这恰恰就是马修·罗思在《魔豆：大豆在美国的崛起》一书里试图告诉读者的。
对国人来说，大豆的好处是不言自明的。清代河南的唯一一位状元吴其濬（1789-1847）在《植物名实图考》里就指出，大豆“种植极繁，始则为蔬，继则为粮，民间不可一日缺者”。当然，今天的大豆早已不是主食（虽然自古它就是“五谷”之一）了，但豆制品譬如豆腐、素鸡、酱油等，都是极其寻常的菜肴与调味品，另外上海的早点有“四大金刚”一说，豆浆也是其中之一。基于这样的印象，罗思在《魔豆》里描述的二十世纪初期大豆在美国的境遇就颇有些难以理解了：1907年，大豆“总栽培面积大概是5万英亩，分散在全美国3亿英亩的农场之中；相比之下，小麦的栽培面积是4500万英亩，燕麦则是3500万英亩”。
这是因为大豆漂洋过海到美国路途遥远姗姗来迟的缘故吗？似乎也不见得。按照罗思的说法，早在1765年，大豆种子被英国东印度公司的一名海员从中国经伦敦带到北美殖民地，并于同年在北美大陆东南沿海的佐治亚的一个农场首次试种。几年后，美国独立的功勋人物，著名外交家、发明家本杰明·富兰克林在出使英国期间也可能获得过大豆的种子，因为他给居住在费城的朋友植物学家约翰·巴特拉姆（John Bartram）寄去了豆种。到了十九世纪，来过中国的传教士与移民美国的亚裔也通过不同的渠道将大豆带到了美国。美国政府在“大豆种子能够大量漂洋过海，实现移栽到美国土地”的过程中扮演了至关重要的角色：1898年，美国农业部植物…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Anyone using GoboLinux at the present time ? I came across it on Tumblr and it is quite different from other distros. Instead of stuff like /usr/bin/, /sbin, /lib as Linux usually is set up, every applications with its dependencies, libraries are all in a sub-directory of its own. For example, /Programs/Gimp/ is on its own, and so is /Programs/Openscad/. There are symlinks to the traditional locations within the operating system.
 It is console centric, everything from the command line, just like the late 1990s. It is almost DYI. 
 I have already downloaded the iso and tried using the live version of the system, it is really different. It almost reminds me of when I installed Slackware 3.4 for the first time on my 486 box. 
 Tonight, I think I will clear off one of the hard drives in my 2009 Mac Pro and do the install of GoboLinux.

The best way to keep it safe going forward, is to have the community own it, so we open sourced it: https://github.com/open-product-data/digital-cameras
I'm aware of a number of attempts to make product data open-sourced, but none have the power of the photo geeks behind it :)
Thoughts or ideas? + really looking for some contribution love.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I switched to Linux about 1,5 years ago. I didn't know much about desktop Linux, and jumped straight into Arch (EndeavourOS) since I'm a developer and all research pointed me to either Arch or Fedora.
 Unfortunately at that time, I had an NVIDIA laptop and Fedora's live-usb refused to boot correctly, so I ditched it right away.
 My journey with Arch was a great learning experience. It thought me a lot about pulseaudio/pipewire, X11/Wayland and many other things, which were really fun to mess with.
 Now that I got rid of my old laptop and built myself an all-AMD PC, I've decided to distrohop for the first time - and wanted to give Fedora a try.
 The switch was an amazing breeze, since I had my user-folder on a separate drive. After adding it to fstab, it was all there, the configs, the themes... just like that.
 I went with Fedora 38, even though it's "beta", it doesn't make me feel like I'm running a beta-ish OS, compared to other "Insider Release" OSes.
 So yeah, I'm a Fedora user now, but admittedly, I still miss the convenience of the AUR, btw.

About me: I spent 15 years designing stamping dies on a high end cad system. During that time, I also developed and marketed extensions/plugins toward that cad system. Through that experience, I came disillusioned with 'vendor lock-in' and proprietary software in general. I basically retired, took the vow of poverty and moved all my computing to open source. I have since, and continue to, try and improve the open source cad environment.

My cofounder Hemant (@hemantgangolia) has been living in the US since 6 years and has tried multiple times to invest in India. He couldn't go ahead with the process because bank account opening was a challenge and the process after that wasn't clear.

 Is it because once you are able to understand the plumbing of the OS you believe you have the right to be more aggressive towards other that never had the change to work on the same things?
 I'm a 100% Linux user/developer for years, but still I get very disappointed when I land into pages like the lkml.org (the linux kernel mailing list management portal) and I see on the home page things like this: 
  
In case you haven't read the titlebar of your webbrowser's window: this site is the (unofficial) Linux Kernel Mailing List archive. This mailing list is a rather high-volume list, where (technical) discussions on the design of, and bugs in the Linux kernel take place. If that scares you, please read the FAQ. 
  
Why that tone?
 Are those people learning from "THE" very prominent individual well known to have public burst of anger?

据界面新闻，美光是存储芯片三巨头之一，其内存、闪存等产品在手机、电脑、服务器等领域广泛使用。集邦咨询数据显示，2022年第四季度，在全球DRAM市场，三星电子、SK海力士和美光科技排在前三名，市占率分别为45.1％、27.7％和23.0％；在NAND市场，美光科技排名第五，市占率为12.3%；三星电子、SK海力士分列第一、第三位，市占率分别为31.4%、18.5%。


3月29日，存储芯片厂商美光公布了2023财年第二财季报告，当季营收为36.9亿美元，上一财季为40.9亿美元，去年同期为77.9亿美元，同比下降约53%。


美光科技第二财季亏损23.1亿美元，其中包含计提超14亿美元的库存损失，每股亏损2.12美元。这是美光过去二十年来最严重的季度亏损，上一次出现如此规模的季度亏损是在2003财年第二财季，当时美光净亏损达19.4亿美元。


美光首席执行官Sanjay Mehrotra宣布，除了高级主管减薪、全面停发2023会计年度奖金外，目前预期整体人力缩减比例将逼近15%（原先预估为10%），措施包括扩大裁员以及2023年12月底前遇缺不补。

Twitter 上周披露它的部分源代码被人在今年初上传到 GitHub，当时 Twitter 刚刚被收购并解雇了数千名员工。上周五 GitHub 在 Twitter 的要求下删除了该仓库。本周二，法庭应 Twitter 要求 GitHub 在 4 月 3 日前提供上传者所有的身份信息，包括姓名、地址、电话号码、电邮地址、社交媒体资料和 IP 地址。此外，还要求提供下载和修改该代码仓库数据的用户信息。

开源聊天机器人在质量评估上能达到 ChatGPT 的九成

开源聊天机器人 Vicuna-13B 基于 Meta 的大语言模型 LLaMA，它使用了用户通过 ShareGPT 分享的 7 万对话样本进行微调。研究人员让 OpenAI 的 GPT-4 作为裁判，去对比 Vicuna-13B 以及 ChatGPT 和谷歌 Bard，结果显示它在质量评估中能达到 ChatGPT 的 92%，而 Bard 为 93%，LLaMA 为 68%。Vicuna-13B 的训练成本只花了 300 美元。研究人员还计划释出其模型权重。


消息来源：Vicuna



老王点评：这说明并一定非得用海量的参数、巨额的训练费用，也可以取得可观的 AI 效果。所以，AI 也会有类似的“摩尔定律”，会随着时间迅速降低 AI 成本和提高 AI 效果。

孙德谦（1869-1935），字受之，又字寿芝，号益葊，晚号隘堪居士，江苏元和（今苏州吴中、相城区）人。历任直隶永年紫山书院山长，江苏存古学堂协教，东吴大学、政治大学、大夏大学等校教授等。著有《古书读法略例》《太史公书义法》《刘向校雠学纂微》《汉书艺文志举例》《诸子通考》《四益宧骈文稿》《六朝丽指》等。今人张京华、黄曙辉编有影印本《孙德谦著作集》，搜罗较全。生平见于王蘧常《元和孙先生行状》、吴丕绩《孙隘堪年谱初稿》等。
孙氏治学，博通四部，尤以治子名世（1928年，孙氏六十岁，曾于病中作自挽联云：“勉为传人，勉为完人，实是苦人，祈死已多年，寿阅六旬，可以休矣；能通经学，能通史学，最深子学，行文工骈体，书刊四部，倘不朽乎？”吴丕绩：《孙隘堪年谱初稿》，《学海》创刊号、第一卷第六期、第二卷第二期，1944年7月、12月，1945年2月）。少从同里雷甘溪治经，喜高邮王念孙、引之“父子之学，兼及声音、训故”（王蘧常：《元和孙先生行状》，《大夏周报》第十二卷第九期《追悼孙德谦先生专号》，1935年12月）。年三十，又病王氏之学琐碎，不能通知大谊，乃转师会稽章学诚，以章氏治史之法治子。九流百家，钩索质验，贯殊析同，撮其指意，斐然有作。自言“生平得力在周秦名家之术，于学问能详加辨析异同得失，咸思核实以求其真”（孙德谦：《答钱子泉先生书》，转引自吴丕绩《孙隘堪年谱初稿》）。弱冠用功于骈文，造诣与李审言媲美，而逸气清空，自成一格。晚年声闻颇宏，被尊为“国学大师”。沈曾植颇为赏识，将其与张尔田、王国维并目为海上“三君”。德国颜复礼、日本福田千代作等亦向风来学。“德意志汉堡大学且以重金求述作，日本宫内省亦访先生书进呈其国主”，海上同文书院尝欲请其前往讲学，狩野直喜亦拟聘其担任中国文化研究…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[你需要一款 ChatGPT 的平替？还得是开源的？看起来我们已经被卷入了与 ChatGPT 的开源大战。




Databricks 这家软件公司，在各个领域都有所建树，尤其是在数据仓库和基于人工智能的解决方案方面。

最近，随着 ChatGPT 横空出世，Meta、谷歌甚至 Mozilla 都开始效仿 ChatGPT。

而现在，Databricks 开源了其 大型语言模型large language model（LLM）“Dolly”，也正在以自己的方式进行尝试。

我们一起来看看它。

发生了什么？ 在最近的公告中，Databricks 介绍了他们号称 “廉价构建” 的 LLM，使用 EleutherAI 的已经开源的参数 模型 提供功能。

他们在该模型基础上稍作调整，赋予了 Dolly 指令诸如头脑风暴和文本生成的能力。

当你拿它与 GPT-3 中的 1750 亿个参数 比较时，Dolly 的 60 亿个参数 就可能显得微不足道。

但是，当 Databricks 的人看到即使数据量与 GPT-3 相差这么多，Dolly 也能 展示很多与 ChatGPT 相同的能力 时，他们感到非常震惊。

下面是他们展示的其中一个例子：



原始模型使用了 Alpaca 的数据，该模型由斯坦福大学以 Meta 的 LLaMA LLM 为基础建立。

但是，正如你所看到的，原始模型产生了一个非常杂乱无章的结果，而 Dolly，通过不同的模型和调整，能够产生一个更为可用的答案。


📝 有趣的事实：“多莉Dolly” 名字取自世界上第一只克隆羊。


为什么是现在？ 根据 Databricks 的说法，他们认为 **许多公司更愿意建立自己的模型，**而不是将数据发送给某个紧紧掌握模型只对外提供 API 的集中式供应商。

许多公司可能不愿意将他们最敏感的数据交给第三方，然后在模型质量、成本和所需行为方面进行各种权衡。

你想看看吗？

当然，但有一个问题。

你必须 使用他们的平台来使用 Dolly，他们已经开源了一个 Databricks 笔记本，可以帮助你在 Databricks 上构建它。

此外，如果你想获得训练好的权重，你必须联系他们。不过我不确定他们是否会免费提供使用权。

总而言之，这种开源其模型的举动应该对其他公司有好处，可以保护他们的数据、节省运营成本，其他公司也能使用它创建自己的模型。

你可以查看其 公告博客，以了解更多技术细节和其他计划。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[在 Ubuntu 的混合风味中加入肉桂味，完美！




在等待下个月的 Ubuntu 23.04 吗？

好吧，我们已经提到，在 Ubuntu 23.04 版本的 令人兴奋 的事情中，包括一个新的官方的 Cinnamon 风味（它最初是 Ubuntu Cinnamon Remix）。

而且，它**现在是官方版本*，因为 Ubuntu 的技术委员会以足够的票数 批准了它。

Ubuntu Cinnamon 23.04 值得期待的地方



如果你之前已经使用过 Ubuntu Cinnamon Remix（非官方），你可能对它有点概念了。

如果你想要一个带有 Cinnamon 桌面的 Ubuntu 风味版，而没有众多的特殊定制，Ubuntu Cinnamon 适合你。

而另一方面，Linux Mint 也是一个基于 Ubuntu 的 Cinnamon 桌面。然而，你会得到一个 Mint 特有的主题、图标、工具和调整，体验有所不同。

基本上，如果你使用 Linux Mint，它不会让你感觉到 “只是另一种 Ubuntu 风味”。

别忘了，Linux Mint 默认禁用 Snap，而且是 Flatpak 优先的，这与 Ubuntu Cinnamon 23.04 的情况完全相反。



所以，如果你喜欢使用 Snap 而不是 Flatpak，并且喜欢 Ubuntu 通常的风味版的工作方式，Ubuntu Cinnamon 是一个不错的补充。关于这个版本的其他一些值得注意的地方包括：


预装的应用程序，如 Synaptic Package Manager、LibreOffice 等

Ubuntu 的 Yaru 主题

没有像你期望的 Linux Mint 那样的 XApp


目前，根据其 最新的日常构建，Ubuntu Cinnamon 23.04 几乎已经准备好发布（将于下个月发布）。

它是否会赢得 Linux Mint 用户的青睐，那是另外一个故事。但是，Ubuntu 上的新 Cinnamon 版应该会让更多的用户尝试 Cinnamon 桌面，这是件好事。

Cinnamon 桌面融合了传统 Windows 风格的布局，并提供了更多的功能。

你可以在 Ubuntu Cinnamon 博客 上阅读官方公告。

你考虑改用 Ubuntu Cinnamon 作为你的首选口味吗？请在评论中分享你的想法。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Unix philosophy, originated by Ken Thompson, is a set of cultural norms and philosophical approaches to minimalist, modular software development.
  
-This doesn't apply just to command line applications like piping ls into dir, cat into bat, or man into tldr.
 A good example is how some web browsers will develop their own PiP video player, while another just gives you suggestions for how to play video using MPV or VLC. That web browser could also incorporate yt-dlp, and so can MPV. A file browser can send information to a CLI based disk burner to burn an iso or data, or transfer files to your phone through kdeconnect-cli or to google drive through their cli interface in the background.
 2 programs I use very heavily that are very modular like this are LF and Qutebrowser. -Curious what others are using that follow the Unix philosophy.

We're building a unified backend for LLM apps, where you can manage your data, prompts, embeddings, and deployments. Demo video here: https://www.loom.com/share/97bc388f6b6c4c95bf6c51c832bfd8a5.
Most LLM apps can be built by properly integrating LLMs with a knowledge base consisting of domain-specific or company-specific data. The scope of this knowledge base can change based on the task- it can be something as narrow and static as your API docs or as broad and fluid as meeting transcripts from your customer support calls.
To effectively use their data, most teams need to build a similar stack—datasource integrations, async embedding jobs, vector databases, bucket storage for non textual data, a way to versio…]]></summary>

Getting from a product idea to a design is too hard. Wireframing tools (e.g. Balsamiq) are limited and their output is too low-fidelity to get people excited about the idea. On the other hand, high-fidelity design tools (e.g. Figma) require advanced skills and are better for tweaking fine details than hashing out a big picture. Meanwhile, companies have an insatiable need to make new screens and change existing ones, and hiring more designers is time-consuming and expensive.
David and I were on the design tools team at Airbnb when we realized there’s another solution: let designers encode their knowledge (e.g. design rules …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[一封有关暂停训练高级人工智能（AI）的公开信日前引发热议。路透社30日报道称，这封公开信的主要内容是呼吁在6个月内暂停高级人工智能的开发。理由是AI可能对社会和文明构成潜在风险。目前已有1000多名科技界和AI领域的重量级人物签署公开信，其中包括特斯拉首席执行官马斯克、苹果公司联合创始人沃兹尼亚克、Stability AI总裁莫斯塔克、AI企业DeepMind的多名研究员。


《华尔街日报》援引该公开信背后的组织者之一泰格马克的话表示，AI的进展已超过许多专家几年前认为可能达到的程度。他说，“这就像是一场自杀式竞赛，谁先到并不重要，重要的是整个人类有可能会失去对自己命运的控制。”泰格马克表示，6个月的暂停开发将让整个行业获得“喘息之机”，那些选择谨慎行动的公司并不会处于劣势。


尽管已有1000多人在公开信上签字，但诸多业内人士提出不同意见。Meta副总裁兼首席AI科学家勒邱恩表示，因为不认同这封信的前提条件，他没有在这封信上签名。而Stability AI首席执行官莫斯塔克则发推文称，虽然自己已在信上签名，但他不赞同暂停开发6个月的提议。同时，据美国CNBC网站29日报道，谷歌也并未受到这封公开信的影响，其正在重组虚拟助手部门，以更加专注于开发人工智能聊天技术Bard。


信中称，我们目前开发的高级人工智能正在对人类社会造成威胁，各大AI实验室之间的竞争已经失控，然而，包括AI的创造者在内，没有人能理解、预测或可靠地控制它们。


“我们是否应该把所有工作都自动化，包括那些有成就感的工作？我们是否该开发机器大脑，让它们比人脑还多，比人脑还聪明，最终淘汰我们取代我们？我们是否应该冒文明失控的风险？”信中诘问道。


这些问题已经摆在我们面前，但我们没有做好准备。


因此，这封公开信呼吁所有人立即暂停AI研究至少六个月，然后加速制定安全协议，此…]]></summary>
