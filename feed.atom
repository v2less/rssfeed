        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Flatpak package format promises to
bring "the future of apps on Linux", but a Linux distribution like
Fedora already provides packages in its native format—and built
to its specifications.  Flatpaks that come from upstream projects may or
may not follow the packaging guidelines, philosophy, and practices so they
exist in their own world, separate from the packages that come directly
from Fedora.  But those worlds have
collided to a certain extent over the 
past year to two.  Recently, a
packager announced their plans to stop packaging the Bottles tool, used for running
Windows programs in Wine-based containers on Linux, in favor of
recommending that Fedora users install the upstream Flatpak.]]></summary>

 Flathub page: https://flathub.org/apps/details/com.hunterwittenborn.Celeste
 Snap page: https://snapcraft.io/celeste
  
After a few months of work, I'm proud to introduce Celeste, a GUI file synchronization application that aims to work with virtually any cloud provider.
 Celeste started from my needs of needing a new desktop client for Nextcloud. The official one had some issues with memory leaks that would always end up freezing my main laptop, and the UI wasn't quite how I wanted it to be.
 This ended up with my wanting to develop a new GTK client for my needs, which was originally just going to be for WebDAV servers, but then I remembered about rclone and how it can connect to pretty much any storage provider out there. From that point I changed gears to making the application work with more cloud providers, thus getting to current state of Celeste.
 Currently Celeste can connect to Dropbox, Google Drive, Nextcloud, ownCloud, and generic WebDAV servers. More storage types are also planned for the future, including Microsoft OneDrive and Amazon S3.
 If you have any questions about the project or just want to leave some feedback, feel free to leave them in the comments below or on the project's GitHub page linked at the top :).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Pretty sure I already know what kind of answers I'll get, but I figured I'd ask anyways; Are there any 'popular' object based shells in the Linux world? I'm a big fan of the benefits of dealing with static object types over text parsing when it comes to pipelines and discoverability.
 PowerShell exists, but being rooted in the Windows world, it doesn't seem to have gained a lot of traction in the *nix world even though in theory any non-Windows integrations should function just fine.
 I've stumbled also upon Nushell, which seems to try to emulate the value proposition of PowerShell and appears to have pretty active development, but it's still pretty new and presumably feature incomplete.
 I know repl's for various full fledged OOP languages exist, but I haven't seen a case where the repl can also deliver on the core competencies of a dedicated shell when it comes to concisely automating and interacting with the os and its resources. Has anyone seen any offerings that have gained more traction than the two I mentioned above?
 Edit: Anyone who is interpreting this as a Microsoft VS Linux post is mistaken. I'm strictly looking at things from a productivity standpoint, regardless of platform.

We built Nango to solve the pain of accessing OAuth APIs. Despite OAuth being a standard protocol in theory, it remains a major burden to implement it, even with the help of a library. You still need to add endpoints and logic to your app for the server-side dance, implement token refreshes, build & secure your token storage, deal with redirects on the frontend etc.
But the worst part is that (almost) every API has quirks and non-standard behaviour. This is why we think open source and knowledge sharing is key here: With the templates in Nango we capture these edge cases and make sure that OAuth just works.
How it works:
Nango is a small Typescript/Node.js service that handles the OAuth dance, token storage & refreshes for you. It works with any language, API or framework. It is easily self-hostable for free, or as a cloud service if you want to avoid the burden of securing tokens yourself (that’s how we pay the bills). To get started we recommend you take a look at our Quickstart on the GitHub repo: https://github.com/NangoHQ/nango
We currently support 40+ popular APIs. Adding a new one is as simple as updating a YAML file, so anybody can contribute one. In the coming weeks we plan to add a dashboard, a proxy to authorise requests, monitoring and more APIs.
One thing we learned from talking to other engineers about OAuth is that everybody has their own horror stories: What was the hardest OAuth API you ever used? What made it so difficult? We look forward to your stories and your feedback on Nango!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[谷歌宣布了挑战 ChatGPT 的 AI 服务 Bard

ChatGPT 能以对话的方式回答用户输入的各种问题，它引入了信息检索的新模式，向谷歌统治多年的搜索引擎市场发起了挑战。Bard 基于谷歌的 LaMDA 语言模型开发，目前先向挑选的部分人员提供了测试。Bard 相对于 ChatGPT 的一个优势是，它能利用最新的数据，而 ChatGPT 的数据截止于 2021 年。

另外，百度也 宣布 将于下个月推出自己的 AI 聊天机器人“文心一言”（ERNIE），它基于百度从 2019 年起开始开发的语言模型，目前已是它的第三版迭代，ERNIE 可以写诗和文章，或使用文本提示自动生成图像。


消息来源：CNN



老王点评：AI 大战已经开打了，只是不知道最后哪些公司会折戟沉沙。顺便说一句，我今天用 ChatGPT 翻译了一篇文章，并 发布 在 Linux 中国的官网和公众号上，感觉 ChatGPT 的部分表现超乎预料。




Mozilla 恢复开发 iOS 上基于自己的引擎的 Firefox

前几天，我们报道过谷歌开始“实验”基于自己的 Blink 引擎的 Chromium 浏览器。基于对欧盟新政策的相同预期，Mozilla 也开始恢复 iOS 上使用 Gecko 引擎的 Firfox 浏览器的开发。几年前，Mozilla 就进行了类似的实验，但是根据当前的苹果应用商店要求，不使用 WebKit 的 Firefox 浏览器不能通过 iOS 应用商店发布。


消息来源：The Register



老王点评：看来苹果的浏览器引擎垄断被打破的可能很高。




亚马逊计划使用燃料电池运行数据中心

由于无法获得满足其不断增长的数据中心所需的电力，亚马逊初步计划将在三个数据中心安装近 75 兆瓦的燃料电池容量，未来将会扩大到另外四个地点。燃料电池从天然气或氢气等燃料中提取电能，不需要燃烧，但对于天然气，仍然会产生二氧化碳温室气体。此举措的部分原因是该地区的电力传输基础设施存在挑战，一些人反对高压输电线路穿过他们的土地。但这一决定实际上会增加亚马逊在该地区的碳足迹。


消息来源：The Register



老王点评：这不是和碳排放本末倒置了吗？]]></summary>

 But all of these have a problem: you can't modify image-based a lot, the snapshot-based ones aren't reproducible (and neither are those with A/B partitions), A/B takes a lot of space and almost-immutable loses most of the benefits of immutability. But there is one more that (AFAIK) no distro uses yet: overlays, which I think Pop!_OS might go with.
 After reading the kernel docs about overlayFS, I came up with this approach: * The system files will be stored in the (immutable) /system, and the folders like /etc/ and /usr/ will be symlinks to /system/etc and /s…]]></summary>

编辑按：此文的翻译是一次 AI 实验。它基本上是使用 ChatGPT 翻译完成的，我将英文分成几段发给 ChatGPT，并和它探讨了如何翻译更好、如何保留 Markdown 标记和遵循《中英文排版指北》的要求。在往复了几次之后，ChatGPT 基本上可以给出还算满意的答复，有些地方超乎我的预期，有些地方则不如我用来对照的 DeepL。在最终发表前，我还稍做了润色。

另外，由于在一个小时内提交了太多的请求而被限流，所以还等待了一段时间。

最后，我请 ChatGPT 给这次实验和阅读这篇文章的读者说几句。


编辑：好了，翻译完了，感谢您的工作。这次翻译是一次实验，用来看看像你这样的 AI 可以在翻译方面做到什么程度。最后，我想请你给看到这篇译文的读者说几句。

ChatGPT：感谢您对我们进行翻译能力的评估。作为 OpenAI 训练的大型语言模型，我们致力于提供高质量的翻译服务。我们希望未来能够继续为您的语言需求提供支持，让沟通变得更加容易。



Servo 是一个基于 Rust 的实验性浏览器引擎，最初由 Mozilla 的研究部门开发，但后来 转移 到 Linux 基金会 作为一个社区维护的项目。

从那时起，尽管参与的成员一直在努力，但没有重大的发展。

直到现在。

随着团队发布了一份充满希望的规划，2023 年 Servo 的前景正在改善。

让我带你了解一下。

📢 2023 年路线图：概览



由于在 1 月份获得了 新的资金，Servo 项目 复活 了。

为了确保目标的明确，开发团队发布了今年的路线图，以展示其计划的良好前景。

关于这一点，他们还补充说：


我们正在重启所有通常的活动，包括 PR 整理和审查、项目的公共沟通、安排 TSC 会议。我们还将进行一些外部宣传，以吸引更多的协作者、合作伙伴，和有兴趣合作、参与与资助项目的潜在赞助商。


他们还共享了 7 个他们想要在 2023 年实现的目标：

重新激活项目：这是第一阶段，将持续到 2023 年底，涉及重新激活整个 Servo 项目。

项目推广：在项目重新活跃起来的 GitHub 页面的推动下，他们计划宣传该项目，进行一些推广努力。这将吸引更多的协作者、公司和伙伴，他们可能对贡献或资助项目感兴趣。

主要依赖项升级：Servo 的几个依赖项将得到改进，因为它们比较陈旧，需要升级，例如 WebRender 和 Stylo。

布局引擎选择：Servo 目前有两个布局引擎：2013（原引擎）和2020（新引擎）。他们将与贡献者和社区一起决定选择哪个作为长期发展的引擎。

对基本 CSS2 支持的进展：在完成上述两件事后，他们计划朝着基本的 CSS2 符合性 努力。

探索安卓支持：他们希望探索支持安卓平台以及其他平台的可能性，因为他们已经在过去对该平台进行了试验。

可嵌入的浏览器引擎实验：对于路线图的最后阶段，他们的目标是将 Servo 变成一个“可嵌入的浏览器渲染引擎”。团队也在探索这方面的可能性，让某种 Servo 演示在嵌入式设备上运行，或者研究现有的项目，如 Tauri。

你可以通过 官方公告 了解更多关于该路线图的信息。

总结

一个用 Rust 开发的网页引擎可以产生奇迹，比基于 Blink 或 Gecko 的替代品更优秀。

此外，我们几乎每天使用的浏览器再多一个开源替代品不应该是一件坏事，它将让我们有更多选择。

💬 你对 Servo 计划重新开始，并专注于回到最初设计的轨道上有什么看法？

一、历史学家与历史事实
身处后现代思潮冲击后和全球化的时代，如何理解历史学家对历史事实所承担的责任？
E. H. 卡尔（Edward Hallett Carr），一位在英国外交部工作二十年，却利用一切可以利用的闲暇时光研究历史的历史学家，以其独特的经验和经历，在上世纪六十年代，就曾颇具启发地将历史学家研究历史事实的过程，类比为谨慎地航行在西西里海岸附近的锡拉巨岩和其对面经常吞噬船只的卡律布迪斯旋涡（Charybdis）的危险旅程——这块巨岩就是那种客观的编辑事实、事实无条件优越于解释的站不住脚的历史理论，卡律布迪斯旋涡也是一种站不住脚的历史理论，因为这种理论把历史学家当作是历史学家头脑中的主观产物，安排历史事实并通过解释的过程来控制历史事实。
在卡尔看来，历史学家和历史事实之间是一个互相作用的过程，也是一个现在与过去之间永无休止的对话过程。历史学家在历史事实面前既不是卑微的奴隶，也不是专制的暴君，二者是一种平等的、互动的关系，没有事实的历史学家是无本之木，没有前途；而没有历史学家的事实是死水一潭，毫无意义（《历史是什么？》，[英]E.H.卡尔著，陈恒译，商务印书馆2017年版，114-115页）。卡尔的这番思考，深刻提醒我们，历史事实从不会自动说话，它离不开历史学家的解释，同时历史学家在研究历史的过程中，要对自己所持的既定预设，保持一种清醒的反思。
二、山西票号与中国内陆资本主义
阅读王路曼关于近代山西票号的研究，是一场智识之旅。这是因为该著不仅是一部告诉我们清代山西票号纷繁事实的历史著作（该著英文版是西方学术界第一本系统研究山西票号的著作），系统地利用了大量关于十九世纪山西票号的档案、账册、书信、地方志等新鲜史料，同时还带给我们深刻的…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[使用下面的步骤在 GNOME Boxes 应用中的宿主机和客体机之间共享一个文件夹。


GNOME Boxes 是一个创建和管理虚拟机的前端应用。它主要是为 GNOME 桌面开发的。然而，你可以在其他桌面环境中使用它，如 KDE Plasma 和其他环境。

在后端，它使用 QEMU、KVM 和 libvirt 技术，并提供一个易于使用的用户界面来管理多个虚拟机。

如果你想了解更多，你也可以参考关于 GNOME Boxes 创建虚拟机的 这些指南。

在之前的文章中，我们已经解释了如何在 virt-manager 和 VirtualBox 中共享文件夹。而下面的步骤也解释了 GNOME Boxes 的情况。

如何在 GNOME Boxes 中共享文件夹和文件

GNOME Boxes 主要支持 SPICE 协议 来实现远程访问、共享和许多虚拟化功能。SPICE 是虚拟化领域中最古老的开源包之一。

1、初始设置

首先，确保在客体机系统中安装以下 spice 软件包。

sudo apt install spice-vdagent spice-webdavd   # for Ubuntu-based distros
sudo dnf install spice-vdagent spice-webdavd   # Fedora, RHEL, etc
pacman -S --needed spice spice-gtk spice-protocol spice-vdagent # Arch Linux (optional)


在你安装完上述内容后，重启宿主机和客体机系统。

在宿主机系统中（对于 GNOME 桌面），打开 “设置Settings”，进入 “共享Sharing” 面板。

使用顶部的切换按钮启用共享。

然后，点击 “文件共享File Sharing” 启用文件共享。请确保启用网络。密码是可选的。如果你想为你的共享文件夹启用基于密码的认证，请启用它。





关闭设置窗口。

打开 GNOME Boxes。右键单击虚拟机并选择 “偏好Preferences”。

在偏好设置窗口中点击 “设备和共享Devices and Shares”，并点击共享文件夹下的 “[+]” 按钮。

在 “本地文件夹Local Folder” 下：从你的宿主机中选择你想在客体机中访问的文件夹。

在 “名称Name” 中，给予你想要的任何名称。这个名称将在客人的文件管理器中可见。

点击 “保存Save”。



2、为客体机设置

启动你的客体机虚拟机。

在客体机虚拟机内，打开文件管理器。如果你使用的是 GNOME 桌面，打开 Nautilus（即 “文件Files” 应用）。

点击 “其他位置Other Locations”。你应该在 “网络Networks” 下看到 “Spice 客户端文件夹Spice client folder”。

双击它，你应该看到你的宿主机系统的文件夹内容。

有时，上述文件夹需要一些时间才能出现。如果它不可见，请等待 1 或 2 分钟。通过 F5 刷新文件管理器窗口。



3、一些故障排除

此外，如果你看到以下错误，那么你需要手动访问该路径。

Unable to access location - HTTP Error: Could not connect: Connection refused




在文件管理器中按下 CTRL+L，调出地址栏。在地址栏中，输入以下内容：

dav://localhost:9843


然后点击回车。然后你应该看到文件夹的内容。SPICE 服务器使用 dav 协议，它在 9843 端口连接客体机和宿主机。



就这样了。现在你可以在 GNOME Boxes 中使用客体机和宿主机之间的文件共享。

下面是一个客体机和宿主机访问同一个文件夹的截图。



如果你遇到任何错误，请在下方发表评论。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[At least, on Ubuntu 22.04.1
 I did a lot of googling and the only thing to even mention this was half a blog post on google (the other half was behind a dead link, so I only got a hint of a solution from it).
 I am making this post in case someone else runs into this issue.
 I ssh'd into my headless server in my admin account. I created a new user for running the service that I wanted to install. I installed the service as a flatpak, ran it as my admin user, and it worked fine. su'd into my service user, and it broke. 
 The error message was
 Note that the directory '/home/user/.local/share/flatpak/exports/share' is not in the search path set by the XDG_DATA_DIRS environment variable, so applications installed by Flatpak may not appear on your desktop until the session is restarted. error: Unable to allocate instance id 
 Searching this turned up hardly anything. Every response was just "reboot your computer", and while that worked for many others that did not solve my issue.
 The only way to fix this problem was to sign in as the user directly, not through su
 I believe the issue was caused by the environmental variable XDG_DATA_DIRS not being properly set. On login, it is set to a directory in your user's home. When you su into another user, it is not updated and stays as the original user. 
 I hope this post saves someone the headache that I experienced from this.

FlappyBirdle combines elements from the game Flappy Bird and the popular word game Wordle. I wanted to see if I could make a game that added urgency to Wordle, while also feeling outragous at the same time. I think I achieved it with FlappyBirdle. Every time you type a letter of the word, the bird flaps its wings and you get closer to the goal. It also has an easy mode that ignores the pipes, so even beginners can get a good score. Let me know if you have any ideas on how I can make it better!

在《矮人要塞》发布到 Steam 前，在 16 年里 Adams 兄弟二人大约总共获得了 1.5 万美元的捐赠。而在该游戏增加了新的内容，商业化发布后的一个月，他们赚到了 723 万美元。除了要交将近一半的税款外，两位创造者为其 16 年的免费游戏获得了足够多的回报，并且还有余力雇佣更多人来帮助他们。《矮人堡垒》在其 Steam 页面上获得了 17000 多条 “压倒性的积极评价”。而同时，该游戏的免费版本仍然可以下载。

老王点评：给我的最大感触就是，当你默默付出多年后，屡屡坚持不住的时候，或许恰如其分的回报就在不远处。




ChatGPT 成功 “应聘” 了谷歌编程工程师

在询问 ChatGPT 是否会取代软件工程师时，ChatGPT 称“不会”，说自己是“一个可以协助完成某些任务的工具，但它不能完全取代人类软件工程师的创造力、解决问题的能力和批判性思维能力。此外，ChatGPT 需要人类的监督和指导才能有效运作”。谷歌的 LaMDA 对此问题的回答也类似。但在谷歌对 ChatGPT 进行编程面试时，其通过了谷歌的三级工程师面试。尽管该职位是谷歌工程团队的入门级职位，年薪也平均高达 18.3 万美元。


消息来源：《PC 杂志》



老王点评：或者 ChatGPT 的回答是基于自保的理由？🤣




因订阅服务欠费，用户打印机被惠普远程禁用

据报道，一位用户反映，由于他用来注册惠普 “即时墨水” 墨盒补充计划的信用卡已经过期，该公司远程禁用了他的打印机。“即时墨水” 是一个按月订阅的项目，会在墨水不足时自动寄送新墨盒。其推荐的家庭计划是每月 5.99 美元，可打印 100 页。但无论你是否使用打印，都需要支付月费。用户也不允许使用在订阅服务之外购买的墨盒，除非退出该计划。


消息来源：The Atlantic



老王点评：明明只是购买了墨盒服务，但看起来却成了 “租赁” 打印机。被网络和订阅服务绑架的未来！

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I know only Pop_OS does this and i am not sure why this is not something more distros do. 
 What the heck is a recovery partition?
 The recovery partition is a partition used by Pop OS that is created on install. It is a fat formatted partition roughly 4GB in size mounted on /recovery. The pop-upgrade tool will sometimes automatically update it, and you can even command your system to boot into it so that you can reinstall your OS with the option to not delete your user files
 Now obviously this feature was probably implemented because OEMs like system76 wanted a way to easily recover your laptop in case something bad happens. It just so happens that it also helps normal users that do not want to search for a USB drive and a second computer in cases where something bad happened.
 And i think this is would be a very cool feature we could all benefit from. In fact it could also be expanded upon. For example with Offline point release upgrades: Similar to the way OpenBSD does release upgrades, by upgrading your system offline from a predictable partition you basically minimize most possible issues that could happen. For example during a blackout you will simply just need to rerun the install process from the recovery partition and not be left with a half broken system.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Matrix 是一套开放的网络标准，专用于去中心化实时加密通讯。

这套标准由 Matrix.org 基金会发布和维护。Matrix.org 基金会是一个非营利性组织，致力于创建一个开放、独立且不断演进的通讯平台。

如果一款应用支持 Matrix 协议，那就可以视它为 Matrix 客户端。

为何要选用 Matrix 客户端？

Matrix 客户端致力于安全性和隐私性，并且提供了一个去中心化的网络，令许多特性得以实现。

自 2019 年（正式版本发布）以来，部分组织以及政府机构便开始逐渐采用 Matrix 协议，从而搭建安全、隐私、可靠的通讯平台。

就实际而言，去中心化的协议实现了不同组织间的相互通讯，同时也使得这个通讯协议得以抵抗审查。

如果你想要逃脱科技巨头的魔爪，那 Matrix 就是正确的选择。

不仅如此，你还可以运行自己的服务器，并加入 Matrix 网络。换言之，通讯的基础设施是去中心化的，但你仍然能够根据需要，对其进行部署和配置。

如果你好奇的话，Matrix 协议具备了你需要的所有基本功能：


去中心化交流

端到端加密

WebRTC 语音通话 / 视频通话

实时同步

消息已读用户显示

“正在输入中” 提示

群组聊天


而且，我还要再强调一次：这个项目是开源的！

所以，Matrix 客户端已经是不二之选了。对那些注重隐私和安全的用户来说，则更是如此。


LCTT 译注：实际上，Matrix 只是在隐私和便利之间达成了一种相对的平衡。它是将类似 Mastodon 的 联邦federated 网络结构用在了聊天中，也就是说，虽然整个网络去中心化成了许多节点，但节点服务器的运营者仍然能对其用户进行少量掌控。但总的来说，相对那些中心化的聊天应用而言，Matrix 是个值得考虑的替代品。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[如果你对 Linux 上的文件管理器感到满意，但你想尝试一个设计上有点不同的文件管理器，SpaceFM 值得一看。


SpaceFM 是一个使用 GTK 工具包的 Linux 的标签式文件管理器，所以它很适合在 GNOME、Mate、Cinnamon 等的桌面上使用。SpaceFM 还具有一个内置的设备管理器系统，所以它特别适合于 Fluxbox 或 fvwm 之类的窗口管理器，它们通常不包括图形设备管理器。如果你对 Linux 上的文件管理器满意，但你想尝试一个设计上有点不同的文件管理器，SpaceFM 值得一看。

安装 SpaceFM

在 Linux 上，你可能会在你的发行版的仓库中找到 SpaceFM。在 Fedora、Mageia、OpenMandriva 和类似的软件中：

$ sudo dnf install spacefm


在 Debian 和基于 Debian 的系统上：

$ sudo apt install spacefm


面板

我不知道为什么 SpaceFM 被称为 SpaceFM，但可能是因为它致力于让你把窗口中的每一点空间都用来做有用的事情。默认情况下，SpaceFM 实际上是相当简单的、标准的文件管理器。它有一个列出你的文件的面板，一个工具栏，和一个菜单栏。



所有的“常规”规则都适用。


双击打开一个目录或在其默认的应用中打开一个文件。

右键点击可获得一个上下文菜单，提供许多标准选项（复制、粘贴、重命名、查看属性、创建新文件夹，等等）。


不过，SpaceFM 使自己与众不同的方式是它的面板系统。SpaceFM 默认显示一个面板。这就是占据大部分空间的文件列表窗口。但它最多可以有四个面板视图，再加上一些用于某些特定任务的额外面板。

在你的文件管理器中，你可以…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[一、徽州碑刻及其相关著录
南宋史学家罗愿在《新安志》中指出：“新安之石不宜于碑，露暴岁久，则剥泐不可读，加以中更寇攘，存者益寡。”不过，尽管因石质所限及兵燹战乱的影响，徽州一地遗存下来的碑刻仍然相当不少。特别是明代中叶以后，随着徽商之崛起，社会生活渐趋繁杂，碑刻之数量遂急剧增多。关于这一点，《袁中郎游记》曾讲述，“公安派”代表人物袁宏道曾与陶望龄、潘之恒等一起游览齐云山，当他看到触目可及的碑碣时，厌恶之情油然而生：“徽人好题，亦是一僻【癖】，薰习成风，朱书白榜，卷石皆遍，令人气短！”袁中郎一向反对复古模拟风气，强调应直接抒发人的性灵，表达真实情感。在他眼里，随处皆在的碑刻，其实是“俗士毁污山灵”。不过，揆诸实际，“徽人好题”的结果，是促使各类文献（包括对联、碑刻）之数量大为增加。
1935年，杭州西泠印社创始人之一、著名金石学家叶为铭撰有《徽州访碑记》，其中罗列了《宋建炎三年造大圣菩萨宝塔碑》和《明嘉靖二十三年叶晴重修宋塔碑记》。叶氏在文中提及：
吾四世祖义公，于明永乐七年由郡城北门附郭迁居新州，而辟地建置，则自五世祖蓁公通籍后经营之。宅左立庙，即今宗祠也。祠左尚存古塔，刊有宋建炎三年建筑记，又有明嘉靖二十三年九世祖晴春公修葺记，叙述源流，明晰无遗，攸关故乡文献、吾族历史。故予于今秋赴歙，椎拓石刻，并摄塔影，以备续修邑志、家乘之采辑。（《浙江省立图书馆馆刊》第4卷第5期，1935年，79-81页）

叶为铭：《徽州访碑记》

新州一地位于歙县北郊，1980年代当地曾发现新石器时代的村落遗址。北宋宣和三年（1121年）歙州改名徽州后，此处一度为州治所在，据说当地迄今尚存有宋城墙遗迹。叶为铭提及的“古塔”（大圣菩萨宝塔）俗称新州石塔，位于今歙县第二中学校园内，该塔全用赭色麻石凿砌而成，高四米六，五层，八面形体，正、背两面刻有南宋建炎建塔和明朝嘉靖重修之铭记，数十年前就被列为安徽…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Basically I am stuck with a damaged board I ordered from pine64 because the enclosure that supposedly fits the SBC I bought does in fact not fit the case. The case bows inwards, I assume from long term-storage in improper conditions (heat or cold), or just incorrect manufacturing. Basically a USB port casing got damaged during installation which is ridiculous.
 pine64 have a terrible return policy of 15 days from getting your equipment which clearly illustrates how pine64 does not stand behind their products at all.
 Tbf I have had one OK experience with pine64 and this new txn has been bad all around. I firmly suggest keeping away from pine64 as a company overall as they seem to know they have lots of issues and just adjusted their return policy to match the lack of quality in their products. Essentially making sure they do not hemorrhage money in returns while continuing to sell their defective products. 
 I hope you've had better experiences than I have, but if you have not ordered from pine64 before I suggest you save your money and choose a better company to order your equipment from.

	So the 6.2 rc releases are continuing to be fairly small and

红帽也许是最著名的 Linux 操作系统供应商，但该公司的 OpenShift 平台才是其增长最快的部分。IBM 在其财报中称 OpenShift 是一项 10 亿美元的业务。OpenShift 基于开源的 Kubernetes 容器编排系统，这是红帽将商业和开源结合起来，为所有参与者带来利益的又一个例子。


消息来源：Venture Beat



老王点评：虽然知道操作系统系统厂商都逐渐扩展其营利方向，但是我还是为 OpenShift 的发展吃惊。




Facebook 被指秘密耗尽用户的电池

以测试功能或问题的名义，比如测试应用程序运行速度或图像的加载方式，“偷偷” 耗尽某人的手机电量，这种做法被称为 “负测试”。一名前 Facebook 雇员因拒绝执行 “负测试” 而被解雇，他被告知这样 “通过伤害少数人，可以帮助更多的人”。

拟议的 Linux 补丁将允许在构建时禁用 CPU 安全缓解措施

如果想避免内核中不断增加的 CPU 安全缓解措施及其相关的性能开销，有一个拟议的 Linux 内核补丁将提供一个新的 Kconfig 构建时选项，来构建一个不安全的内核。之前，有一个等同的 Linux 内核启动参数 mitigations=off，可以允许在运行时禁用针对这些 CPU 问题的各种内核内安全缓解措施。这个新的构建选项可以避免在启动时忘记设置该内核参数。

老王点评：虽然在生产环境或对安全有严格要求的环境中，应该坚持启用这些安全缓解措施，但也可见这些缓解措施对性能的损耗不小。]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[以下是关于 GNOME 截图工具的细节，它的用法、安装方法以及如何用新旧两种方式启动它们。




2022 年，GNOME 改变了其默认的截图工具，并将截图功能构建为 GNOME Shell 的一部分。它不再是一个独立的应用了。

早些时候，GNOME 为主要的 Linux 发行版，如 Ubuntu 和 Fedora，提供了一个原生的 GTK 应用 gnome-screenshot。然而，从 GNOME 42 开始，这个功能已经被移除。因此从 Ubuntu 22.04 和 Fedora 36 开始，你只能得到以下新的截图 UI 作为默认的截图工具。

这一变化从根本上破坏了许多工作流程。因为它不是一个你可以单独启动的可执行文件，你只能依赖键盘上的 Print-Screen 键。而且只能通过应用搜索找到它的快捷方式。

因此，在新的 GNOME 截图 UI 中捕捉延迟的屏幕截图变得更有挑战性。

下面是一些你仍然可以使用旧的 GNOME 截图工具的方法，以及如何手动触发新的截图 UI。

GNOME 截图工具：如何安装旧版 GUI

如果你使用的是 Ubuntu 22.04 及以上版本，或者任何基于 Ubuntu 的带有 GNOME 桌面的发行版，运行以下命令来安装它。

sudo apt install gnome-screenshot


而对于 Fedora 用户，使用下面的命令。

sudo dnf install gnome-screenshot


如果你在 Arch Linux 或者 Manjaro Linux 中使用 GNOME 桌面，那么使用下面的命令来安装它。

pacman -S gnome-desktop


安装后，通过应用程序菜单启动它。





为了进一步定制，你可以打开设置，从 GNOME Shell 的新 UI 中移除 Print-Screen 的按键绑定，并通过以下命令创建一个自定义的键盘快捷方式：

gnome-screenshot --window   <窗口>
gnome-screenshot --area     <区域>
gnome-screenshot            <全屏>


GNOME 截图 UI：如何通过命令行手动触发它

当你从键盘上按下 Print-Screen 键时执行的功能是 GNOME Shell 代码 的一部分。不幸的是，它被保护在 dbus API 内，你不能直接调用它。

这样做是为了让你在 Wayland 下安全，这样就不会有任意的代码通过任何脚本获得对 dbus 调用函数的访问。

然而，这破坏了许多使用场景和人们多年来编写的脚本。例如，许多用户报告说 Zoom 在 GNOME-Wayland 下的视频会议通话 中断 就是因为这个原因，最终通过下面这个关闭安全模式的方法解决了这个问题。

让我们看看如何关闭它并触发 gnome-shell 的截图。

在使用下面的步骤之前，请谨慎行事。因为它可能会开放你的 GNOME Shell，让你任意访问脚本。请确保你知道你在做什么。

首先，你需要打开 GNOME looking glass 来关闭安全模式。

按 ALT+F2 并输入以下内容：

lg




在顶部选择 “Evaluator”，在命令窗口中，输入以下内容。然后点击回车。

global.context.unsafe_mode = true




你应该看到一个响应，即它已被关闭。



现在按 Esc 键关闭 “looking glass”。并打开一个终端。

输入以下内容以启动截图工具：

gdbus call --session --dest org.gnome.Shell --object-path /org/gnome/Shell --method org.gnome.Shell.Eval 'Main.screenshotUI.open();'


你应该看到新的 GNOME Shell 截图被触发了。



如果你想关闭它，再次打开 lg 并将其设置为 false。

global.context.unsafe_mode = false


结束语

从使用上来说，通过关闭安全模式，你仍然可以通过任何 shell 脚本使用新的截图功能。但不建议这样做。最好是使用旧的 GNOME 截图工具来避免所有的麻烦。

干杯。

《现代政治思想史：从霍布斯到马克思》是英国埃克塞特大学政治理论教席荣休教授伊安·汉普歇尔-蒙克（Iain Hampsher-Monk）的代表作，其中译本最近由上海人民出版社出版。面对二十世纪后期以来政治思想史领域中研究路径的争鸣，本书回归经典解读，兼取语境分析，清晰全面而均衡地探讨了近代早期至十九世纪末期的一系列重要政治思想家的观点。本书以霍布斯的“政治世俗化”为开端，依次介绍了霍布斯、洛克、休谟、卢梭、联邦党人、伯克、边沁、密尔、黑格尔、马克思等人的思想，并内在展现了近代以来政治思想发展的两种趋势。如何看待蒙克在史学进路与哲学进路之间会通的立场，如何看待现代政治思想与传统政治思想的巨大转变？本书译者、华东师范大学政治学与国际关系学院周保巍副教授在接受《上海书评》专访时谈到：蒙克认为，在政治思想研究中，历史进路和哲学进路并不是一种非此即彼的排他性关系，而应该超越僵化的路线之争，维持同情性的、语境化的历史理解和理性化、逻辑化的哲学重构之间的创造性紧张，认真地对待彼此的批评和吁求。

【英】伊安·汉普歇尔-蒙克/著 周保巍 等/译，上海人民出版社，2022年9月版


伊安·汉普歇尔-蒙克

在英语世界的政治思想史领域，施特劳斯学派的哲学进路和剑桥学派的历史进路曾势同水火，而在国内，这两派也各自都有不少拥趸，但蒙克却在《现代政治思想史》的中文版序中声称，“围绕政治议题的史学进路和哲学进路之间的思维碰撞，总是如此引人入胜”，他似乎并没有选边站，而是采取了一种兼容并蓄的“会通”立场，您如何看待这种立场？“会通”何以可能？
周保巍：融合和会通一直是蒙克所采取的一种自觉的方法论立场。具体例证有二：一是在埃克塞特大学，蒙克曾长期执教“西方政治思想史”和“分析政治理论”这两门课程，并自如地在这两个相当不同的思想操作系统（一个更加史学化，一个更加哲学化）之间切换；二是当1…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[通过全新的应用程序图标和其他改进，LibreOffice 7.5 似乎有了新的形象。




LibreOffice 7.5 社区版来了，带来许多功能升级和新的应用图标。

之前的主要版本 7.4 版 为微软的专有文件格式提供了更好的 “互操作性”，并进一步巩固了 LibreOffice 作为 Linux 上 微软 Office 的最佳开源替代品 之一的地位。

而现在，一个新的版本来了，里面有很多东西。

让我们来看看带来了什么好东西。

🆕 LibreOffice 7.5 的新变化




在这个版本中，对 LibreOffice 的所有程序都做了大量的改进；一些关键的亮点包括：


新的应用程序图标

Writer 的改进

Calc 的改进

Impress & Draw 的改进

深色模式的改进


新的应用程序图标



LibreOffice 现在具有一套新的应用程序图标，看起来相当现代。这些图标在 GNOME 和 KDE Plasma 等新一代的桌面环境中看起来都很漂亮。

下面是它与旧图标的对比情况。令人耳目一新，对吗？



同样，开发者也更新了 LibreOffice 整个界面上用于各种媒体类型/文件的图标集。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[谷歌正在开发基于 Blink 的 iOS 浏览器

当前的 iOS 版 Chrome 浏览器使用了苹果的 WebKit 渲染引擎，这是因为苹果要求每个 iOS 浏览器都必须使用 WebKit。但据称，谷歌的 Chromium 开发人员已经开始使用谷歌自己的 Blink 引擎为 iOS 开发一个实验性的浏览器。谷歌坚持说这是一个实验，“目的是了解 iOS 上性能的某些方面”，并不打算发布。但是，这个基于 Blink 的浏览器可能是为欧洲的竞争规则做准备，这些规则看起来将要求苹果停止要求其他浏览器必须使用其 WebKit 引擎。


消息来源：The Register



老王点评：就看欧盟能不能敲开苹果的外壳了。




谷歌将在下周披露挑战 ChatGPT 的 AI 工具

据报道，谷歌将在 2 月 8 日披露挑战 ChatGPT 的 AI 工具。该活动将围绕“使用 AI 的力量重新想象如何搜索、探索和与信息互动，使得比以往任何时候更自然、更直观的找到所需要的信息”。谷歌有大量的人工智能技术，但它大多不对公众开放。它有一个名为 LaMDA 的聊天机器人语言模型，和一个名为 Imagen 的图像生成 AI。不过，谷歌有对互联网上其他流行事物反应过度的历史，这些 “克隆竞争对手” 的项目在 “谷歌坟场” 里随处可见。


消息来源：Ars Technica



老王点评：或许，谷歌真的不必慌？




GitHub CEO 认为开源开发者应被豁免于欧盟的《人工智能法案》

欧盟议会即将在未来几个月表决的《人工智能法案》旨在解决人工智能在我们日常生活中日益增长的影响。批评者认为，该法案可能会给通用人工智能系统（GPAI）带来法律责任，并赋予大型科技公司更多的权力和控制权，因为独立的开源开发者没有资源来应对法律纠纷。GitHub CEO 在欧盟开源政策峰会上说，“因为最终这要归结为人。开源社区不是一个实体的社区。它是一个人的社区，合规负担应该落在实体身上，应该落在正在交付产品的公司身上。”


消息来源：Tech Crunch



老王点评：和 之前（#894） 的《网络弹性法案》一样，这些方案在要求加强监管和合规的同时，也无视了开源的社区本质，很可能影响到开源文化的根基。]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[BookStack 是一个开源的、基于网页的文档系统，它允许你创建一个结构化的知识库，供个人、团队或公司使用。


BookStack 是一个开源的、基于网页的文档系统，它允许你创建一个结构化的知识库供个人、团队或公司使用。BookStack 专注于易用性和设计，以适合具有潜在的混合技术技能的受众。它建立在 PHP 框架 Laravel 之上，使用 MySQL 或 MariaDB 作为数据存储。

在尝试为我的工作场所寻找文档或维基系统后，我构建了 BookStack。Confluence 是最符合我要求的选项，但基于用户的定价带了的阻碍。Confluence 的封闭性也对我要构建的文档的寿命提出了质疑。最后，我决定建立自己的平台来满足我的需求。我用 MIT 许可发布它，以回馈我多年来喜爱并从中受益的开源社区。

内容层次和组织选项

为了保持熟悉和直观，BookStack 使用了现实世界的书籍术语来描述其组织结构。文档内容被创建为 “页Page”：


“页” 属于一个特定的 “书Book”。

在一本书中，“页” 可以选择性地被分组为 “章节Chapter”。

随着文档的增长，你可以使用 “书架Shelve” 来对 “书” 进行分类，如果需要，“书” 可以成为多个书架的一部分。


这种结构是 BookStack 的核心，而且往往是决定 BookStack 是否适合你的使用情况的选择因素。

在这个核心层次上，BookStack 还提供了标签、用户收藏夹和高级搜索功能，以确保内容可被发现。

编写文档

在 BookStack 中编写文档的主要方法是通过使用其所见即所得（WYSIWYG）编辑器，它利用了开源的 Tiny 项目。这个编辑器提供了一系列的内容格式，包括：


各种标题级别

代码块

可折叠的块

表格

图片

链接

iFrame 嵌入

提醒呼出

项目符、编号和任务列表

绘图（通过与开源 diagrams.net 的整合）


如果你喜欢 Markdown，你可以使用内置的 Markdown 编辑器，它提供实时预览并支持与所见即所得编辑器相同的功能集。如果权限允许，你甚至可以根据你所编辑的页面，在这些编辑器选项之间跳转。

你的数据是如何存储的

如果使用了 Markdown，除了原始的 Markdown 内容外，文档以相对简单的 HTML 格式存储在 MySQL 或 MariaDB 数据库中。很多设计和开发决定都是为了保持这种 HTML 格式的简单性。它尽可能地使用普通的标准 HTML 元素，以确保原始文档内容保持开放和可移植。

上传的图片、附件和创建的图纸被保存在本地文件系统中，但也可以选择存储在一个与 s3 兼容的数据存储中，比如开源的 MinIO。

为了保持你的内容可访问性，有内置的选项可以将内容导出为 PDF、HTML、纯文本或 Markdown。对于外部使用，有一个 HTTP REST API 和一个 Webhook 系统。在扩展方面，一个 “逻辑主题系统” 允许在广泛的系统事件中运行自定义的 PHP 代码。

为商业做好准备

BookStack 具有一系列的功能来支持商业环境。内置了对一系列认证选项的支持，包括 SAML2、OpenID Connect 和 LDAP，允许使用 KeyCloak 等平台轻松实现单点登录。也支持多因子认证（MFA），并且可以根据角色进行授权。审计日志提供整个实例的修改活动的完整可见性。

一个完全基于角色的权限系统为管理员提供了对系统内容的创建、查看、更新和删除操作的完全控制。这允许每个角色的系统默认值，以及在每个层次项目基础上设置自定义权限的选项。

支持的社区

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[因为十几年前编了本《中国神怪大辞典》，便被人以为我对中国的妖怪懂了些什么，其实这是个误会。因为那本辞典本来是以“神”和“仙”为主，虽然也有一些妖怪的词条，但只是选择一些“有名”的（非著名之名，而是专名之名，诸如“狐精”“虎怪”之类即属非专名者）列入，甚至一度把《山海经》中只怪而不妖的鸟兽都删掉过，所以当时只想把书名称作“神名辞典”。至于最后改为“神怪辞典”，那是出版方朋友所提的建议，我以为非常好，就采纳了，但心中终觉得有些愧疚，想着以后如果有机会就把妖怪部分充实进来。
说了以上这些话，只是表明我对中国妖怪没什么研究。实际上，即便我在辞典中把中国所有的妖怪收罗殆尽，也与“研究”相距甚远，深入的理解更谈不上。现在所以硬着头皮要写这个题目，实在是因为困惑已久，有些不吐不快，更有深望得到行家指教的意思。
总有十年以上了吧，网上还有一些书中，一直流传着一种说法：日本的妖怪百分之七十以上是从中国传过去的，有百分之二十是印度的，他们自己本土的妖怪只有百分之十。对一个在1945年之前从来没有为外族入侵或殖民，因而文化的独立性非常突出的岛国来说，这一论断简直不可思议。但此说有“权威”的支持，据说此话出自日本的妖怪学会会长水木茂。
日本的妖怪学会，恕我无知，还真没听说过，但水木茂先生的书我看过，而且对这位杰出的漫画家能介入妖怪领域也深表敬佩。据我所看到的水木茂编绘的《日本妖怪大全》，书中没有前言、后记，当然也找不到那段话。可是如果把全书七百多种妖怪的图与说看上一遍，我只能得到一种结论，水木茂先生绝对会把“百分之七十”说当成违背常识的蠢话，因为他的七百多种妖怪中，占百分之九十以上的都是产自日本本土。那么那句话是谁说的呢？盼知道的朋友明以告我。
当然，早在明治时期，日本就有学者为日本的一些妖怪到中国去挖根，虽然这与自古以来吸收、攀附中华文化的传统有关，但善意的并不能就是正确的，所以日本民俗学创始人…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[System76 介绍了其即将推出的由 Rust 开发的 COSMIC 桌面环境的开发细节。让我们来看看。




Pop!_OS 的开发者们 早在 2021 年 就开始着手开发他们基于 Rust 的桌面环境 COSMIC。

其目标是制作一些你已经熟悉的 Pop!_OS 的东西，但为你提供一个更快和更可扩展的桌面环境。

System76 也决定 不发布 Pop!_OS 22.10，以专注于它的开发。

另外，我们的一个社区贡献者尝试了它的一个早期版本，它看起来很有希望：

我试用了 System76 新的基于 Rust 的 COSMIC 桌面！如果你还不知道，System76 的开发者一直在开发一个新的桌面环境（被称为 COSMIC），它是用 Rust 编写的：一种内存安全和超快的编程语言。从头开始创建一个桌面环境并不是一件简单的事。这涉及到创建从合成器、...




时间过去了一年，我们现在对这个桌面环境有了更多的期待。

让我们来探索一下 System76 为我们准备了什么。

COSMIC 桌面的 3 项关键性的改进


📋 我们讨论的这些变化和草图在最终发布时可能会有变化。


在 最近的一篇博文 中，来自 System76 的 Alex 让我们看到了 COSMIC 桌面环境的发展状况。

让我带你看看其中值得注意的亮点：


新的用户界面功能

重新打造的设置应用

新的壁纸功能


1、新的用户界面功能



一个新的 SegmentedButton 部件被用来处理 COSMIC 桌面环境中各处的标签和分段式按钮。

它的目的是给人一种简洁、有条理、更集中的菜单体验，而分段式按钮则允许在选择时进行操作。

他们还举了一个例子来解释这对用户界面有什么帮助：

 Should I grab a copy of Red Hat 9 and throw it on a VMware server I have and get a recommended training course and go for it? What do you recommend my direction be?

 Distributions like Fedora, Arch, openSuse Tumbleweed: - very fresh package versions means we always get the latest commits, including security related fixes, but may also introduce brand new zero day security holes that no one yet knows about. New versions usually have new features as well, which may increase attack surface.
 Which is your favourite tradeoff?

I will be giving a talk on glidesort tomorrow at FOSDEM 2023 in the Rust Devroom at 16:10, you can seek me out there as well. In other news, I am leaving academia soon, so if you have interesting (Rust) jobs the coming months feel free to approach me.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[工程师们纷纷批准谷歌联合创始人谢尔盖·布林的代码申请

为了应对 ChatGPT，谷歌的两位联合创始人 回到 谷歌共商对策。已经淡出公司日常管理的顶级富豪谢尔盖·布林提交了多年以来的第一个代码申请，以获得训练 LaMDA 的数据。这是对一个配置文件的两行修改，将他的用户名加入到代码中。几十名工程师回复了“我看行（LGTM）”，批准了这个请求，其中一些批准来自该团队以外的工作人员，他们似乎只是渴望能够说他们给公司联合创始人的代码做了审查批准。


消息来源：福布斯



老王点评：哈哈，给谷歌创始人的代码做批准的机会可不多。




ChatGPT 月活用户达到一亿，史上增长速度最快的消费级应用

OpenAI 是在 2022 年 11 月推出的聊天机器人 ChatGPT。据研究，2023 年 1 月期间 ChatGPT 日独立访客达到 1300 万，这一数字是 12 月的一倍多。1 月份的月活用户达到一亿，为史上增长速度最快的消费级应用。而 TikTok 达到 1 亿用户花了 9 个月时间，Instagram 花了 2 年半时间。分析师称，过去二十年没有一个互联网消费应用能以如此快的速度增长。


消息来源：路透社



老王点评：就这样的用户量和活跃程度，我觉得 ChatGPT 成为一个新的“搜索引擎”没有问题。




苹果活跃设备已达 20 亿台

在今天的季度收益报告中，苹果公司表示，该公司超过了 20 亿台设备的里程碑。去年这个时候，苹果公司说达到 18 亿台活跃设备。自 2019 年以来，其安装量每年增长约 1-1.5 亿台新设备。而活跃设备在短短 7 年内从 10 亿增加到 20 亿，翻了一番。


消息来源：9to5mac



老王点评：看起来苹果的发展依旧很好。]]></summary>

        <updated>2023-02-03T09:16:59.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[在一年后，elementary OS 7 出现了，带来一些激动人心的微妙变化！




elementary OS 6.1 是一个令人印象深刻的版本。终于，过去了一年，下一个主要的升级，elementary OS 7 “Horus” 来了。

这些变化可能不算大规模的翻新，正如以前 报道，开发的重点更多的是在细化上。

elementary OS 7：有什么新内容？

主要的改进领域包括：


应用中心AppCenter

应用程序和系统更新

侧载/替代商店

改进的初次安装体验

应用程序的改进


应用中心升级



在每一次重大的升级中，应用中心AppCenter都得到了很大的重视。虽然它已经提供了完美的体验，但它变得越来越好了，更快的性能、更好的调整以适应不同屏幕分辨率或窗口大小。

应用的描述是这次的亮点。你可以一次看到应用程序的更多屏幕截图，让你对应用程序有更好的了解。



这些图片还包括了图片说明，应该有助于视力有关的残疾用户访问应用程序页面。

从大的方面来说，屏幕截图融入到以应用程序的默认重点颜色为特色的背景中，看起来很不错。

此外，应用程序的描述也会给你提供更多关于该应用程序如何积极维护的信息，以及最近的发布说明。

应用程序更新



你现在可以选择切换是否要自动更新应用程序。

Flatpak 的首选项保持不变；你可以选择让它们自动更新，而不是手动检查。

此外，系统更新一旦下载并准备好，就会离线安装，可以给你一个顺滑的体验。

第三方应用商店

elementaryOS 7 应用中心上的应用程序放在其独立的 Flatpak 软件仓库上。

然而，你仍然可以添加 Flathub 作为软件仓库，以获得更多的 Flatpak 应用程序。

为了告知你这一区别，应用中心会提到一些警告，如 “非策划的Non-Curated”，这样你就知道它是来自另一个应用商店。



当你第一次尝试从第三方商店安装一个应用程序时，这样的弹出警告只会出现一次。

支持网页应用程序



该版本包括 GNOME Web 43，它支持创建网页应用程序，可在应用程序菜单中找到。

你可以在 GNOME Web 中管理所安装的网页应用程序。

重新设计的图标



elementaryOS 已经被视作最漂亮的 Linux 发行版之一。

为了提升体验，几乎每一个应用程序的图标都被重新设计，以提供一个更现代和更有表现力的用户体验。

安装和初次体验



安装体验随着升级而变得更加直接了当。

换句话说，你在安装程序中的看到屏幕数量将减少，但仍然可以得到所有的基本信息，包括警告和系统要求。

安装程序现在可以提示你选择左键或右键设置为鼠标的主按钮。



从系统主题偏好到自动更新，你可以在安装后直接配置所有必要的东西。

新的音乐多媒体应用程序



为了提供更好的多媒体体验，该音乐应用程序已经从头开始完全重写，在各种使用情况下都能很好地工作。

你可以设置本地音乐位置、预览音频文件、获得正确的元数据信息，以及更多。

其他变化

你会发现其他几个细微的改进。其中一些包括：


邮件应用现在采用了更现代、更扁平的设计，以提高响应速度。

邮件应用程序现在支持微软 365 账户。

在任务应用中对新创建的任务列表的离线支持。

在线账户设置包括对 CalDAV 账户的离线支持。

切换选择文件夹，只需点击一下。

重新设计的打印机设置。

电源配置文件管理设置。


你可以参考 官方公告 了解更多细节。

下载 elementary OS 7


📋 当我尝试最新的 RC 构建版时，我的英伟达显卡驱动的系统启动时出现了一个反色的（看起来很奇怪）的彩色屏幕。这对最终版本来说可能不是一个问题。


你可以从 官方网站 上获取最新的 ISO。我希望他们能够为英伟达系统增加一个单独的 ISO，但对于其他系统，它应该可以正常工作。


elementary OS 7


另外，你必须得重新安装，而不是从 elementary OS 6 升级。在你继续安装之前，请查看其 官方 FAQ。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[一个正在开发中令人兴奋的新代码编辑器，基于其自己的 GUI 框架。




如果你看看周围的开源代码编辑器，有几个有前途的新项目可能会挑战 Visual Studio Code 的地位。

当然，这可能不会很快发生。但对支持新项目持乐观态度也无妨。

我们最近在这里介绍了其中的一些选择：

现在，我偶然发现了另一个编辑器，“ecode”。这个项目的作者提到，它从 Lite XL 等编辑器中获得了灵感。

有什么不同？


它建立在其新的 GUI 框架 eepp 之上，该框架专注于提供一个丰富的用户界面。

虽然它的目标是使用最少的资源，但 ecode 的理念针对的是有 SSD、高核心数和良好的 GPU 加速的现代硬件系统。

该代码编辑器可以被编译为在任何现代浏览器中运行。然而，目前的重点并不在网页版的开发上。




这听起来不错。那么，让我们看一看。


🚧 该项目正在大力开发中。你不应该在日常工作中依赖这个工具。


ecode 的特点



ecode 是一个功能强大的编辑器，从一开始就有所有的基本功能。

当然，它有计划随着开发的进展增加更多的东西。就目前而言，这里有一些关键的亮点：


可移植

语法高亮

终端支持

自动补全

可定制的颜色方案

可定制的键盘绑定

LSP 支持

缩略视图Minimap

插件管理器

深色和浅色模式

各种类型的分割视图以适应不同的工作流程


我在 Linux Mint 上简单地试了一下这个编辑器，它看起来确实是正在开发中。

但是，即使在其早期阶段，它也支持广泛的语言和相应的语法高亮。



你可以从一组预定义的主题中快速定制编辑器的主题。

对于编写大量代码（冗长的片段）并需要快速浏览的用户来说，缩略视图将非常方便。

最初，当我在一个空白区域右键点击时，该应用崩溃了。但是，随着下一个版本 0.4.1（在发表这篇文章的时候）的更新，它很快就被修复了。所以，我想说开发进展似乎很有希望。



下载 ecode

你可以尝试一下 在线演示 来快速测试一些选项。

有一个可用于所有 Linux 发行版的 AppImage 软件包。也有用于 macOS 和 Windows 的软件包。

你可以从它的 GitHub 发布页 获得这些包，或者探索它的 源码。


下载 ecode


💬 有这么多有前途的新代码编辑器在开发中，你认为我们会对微软的 VS Code 有一个好的竞争吗？

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[杨讷（1935—2019.1.6）

我认识杨讷先生略早于其他诸位如杨志玖、蔡美彪先生等。因为1978年2月我作为1977级学生入学华东师大历史系不久，听说下半年系里将召开全国性的农民战争史讨论会，各地的学者将来校参会。到了下半年，果然冠盖云集，兰州大学的赵俪生、河北大学的漆侠、历史所的田昌五、陕西师大的孙达人等等都到会了。因为农民战争史是1949年以后的史学领域著名的“五朵金花”之一，倍受学界的关注。在“阶级斗争是历史发展的动力”的理论指引下，很多学者穷年累月投入大量精力，企图从绵延两千余年的农民战争史实中总结出有规律性的经验教训来。今天回过头去看，似乎当年的这种认知很幼稚，但人类的认识就是由浅入深，由片面到全面，经过无数个螺旋式上升得以提高的，没有理由以今天的成熟来讪笑昨天的浅薄。
杨讷先生是以中国社科院历史研究所代表的名义参加研讨会的。1978年时，农民战争史的研究还是有很多“禁区”，唱赞歌的分贝远比否定的声音更为强烈。比如，封建社会中的农民阶级，明明是“只反贪官，不反皇帝”而且拥护好皇帝的皇权主义者，却因为个别起义者针对不平的社会现实，超前地偶然地喊过“均贫富”的口号，因而被一些学者拔高，成为“平均主义”的追求者。他们进而认为这种口号影响下的活动就是反对封建的生产关系，本质上就是反封建。又如每次大的农民起义被平息以后，统治阶级是否会实行“让步政策”，也成了与会者争论的热点。虽然1965年的一言九鼎，肯定了对“让步政策”的批判，从此，“只有反攻倒算，何来‘让步’之说”便一边倒地充斥史坛。但学术毕竟不是现实的政治，武器的批判焉能长久取代批判的武器？到了1977年，争论重又激烈起来了。这些辩难对于刚入校门的大学生来说，真是目眩神迷，不知所从。于是通过王春瑜老师邀请，杨讷先生给我们做了一场辅导性质的学术漫谈。
记得杨讷先生主要讲了三点意见：

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[本文将帮助你理解 情感分析sentiment analysis 的概念，并且学习如何使用机器学习进行情感分析。我们使用了不同的机器学习算法进行情感分析，然后将各个算法的准确率结果进行比较，以确定哪一种算法最适合这个问题。

情感分析是自然语言处理（NLP）中的一个重要的内容。情感指的是我们对某一事件、物品、情况或事物产生的感觉。情感分析是一个从文本中自动提取人类情感的研究领域。它在上世纪 90 年代初才慢慢地开始发展起来。

本文将让你明白如何将机器学习（ML）用于情感分析，并比较不同机器学习算法的结果。本文的目标不在于研究如何提高算法性能。

如今，我们生活在一个快节奏的社会中，所有的商品都能在网上购买到，每个人都可以在网上发表自己的评论。而一些商品的负面网络评论可能会损害公司的声誉，从而影响公司的销售额。因此对公司来说，通过商品评论来了解客户真正想要什么变得非常重要。但是这些评论数据太多了，无法一个个地手动查看所有的评论。这就是情绪分析诞生的缘由。

现在，就让我们看看如何用机器学习开发一个模型，来进行基本的情绪分析吧。

现在就开始吧！

获取数据

第一步是选择一个数据集。你可以从任何公开的评论中进行选择，例如推文或电影评论。数据集中至少要包含两列：标签和实际的文本段。

下图显示了我们选取的部分数据集。



接下来，我们导入所需的库：

import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
from nltk.stem.porter import PorterStemmer
import re
import string


正如你在上面代码看到，我们导入了 NumPy 和 Pandas 库来处理数据。至于其他库，我们会在使用到它们时再说明。

数据集已准备就绪，并且已导入所需的库。接着，我们需要用 P…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[北京时间2月3日早间，苹果公司发布了截至12月31日的2023财年第一季度财报。受iPhone 14 Pro供应链问题影响，苹果在去年最后三个月的营收出现了2019年后首次同比下滑。财报发布后，苹果美股盘后跌逾3%。


营收、利润均不及预期 iPhone销售额同比下降8%


财报显示，苹果第一财季营收为1171.54亿美元，较上年同期的1239.45亿美元下降5%，自2019以来营收首次遭遇同比下滑，市场预计苹果第一财季营收为1211.04亿美元；净利润为299.98亿美元，较上年同期的346.30亿美元下降13%。市场预计苹果第一财季净利润为309亿元美元。每股盈利1.88美元，市场预期为1.94美元。大中华区净销售额为239.05亿美元，较上年同期的257.83亿美元下降7%。


按产品划分，除服务和ipad以外，所有产品类别的销售额都有所下降。


一季度iPhone营收657.8亿美元，市场预期683亿美元，iPhone营收较上年同期的716.28亿美元下降8%。Mac营收为77.4亿美元，市场预期为97.2亿美元，同比下降29%。可穿戴、家居以及配件业务第一财季净销售额为134.82亿美元，较上年同期的147.01亿美元下降8%。


iPad营收为94.0亿美元，市场预期为77.8亿美元，同比增长30%；服务收入为207.7亿美元，市场预期为204.7亿美元，同比增长6.4%。


供应链问题、汇率波动以及宏观经济因素影响一季度财报


苹果首席执行官库克在财报电话会议上透露，美元保持强势；影响iPhone14 Pro和iPhone 14 Pro Max的供应链生产问题；以及整体宏观经济环境三个因素影响了第一财季业绩。


库克解释称，影响苹果业绩的部分原因是美元强势，如果除去800个基点的不利外汇因素影响，苹果营收在大多数市场都实现了增长。


库克还表示，iPhone 14 Pro和iPhone 14 Pro Max的供应量在第一财季大幅减少，这意味着向客户销售的数量也在减少。不过，iPhone产量现在已经回到了正常水平。公司估算如果没有iPhone 14 Pro和iPhone 14 Pro Max供应链的问题，iPhone的营收应当能同比上升。


库克承认，充满挑战的宏观经济环境重创了iPhone、Mac以及Apple Watch等可穿戴设备的销售。


库克还透露，考虑到宏观经济形势，苹果已经调整了支出和招聘计划。例如，该公司“非常严格地管理成本，在某些领域减少了招聘，但在其他领域继续招聘”。他接着说，裁员是“最后的手段”，公司宁愿用其他方式来管理成本。


积极的方面是，苹果宣布到2022年底全球激活的苹果设备达到20亿部，较去年1月多出2亿部。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey HN!
I just shipped a project I’ve been working on called Maroofy: https://maroofy.com
You can search for any song, and it’ll use the song’s audio to find other similar-sounding music.
Demo: https://twitter.com/subby_tech/status/1621293770779287554
How does it work?
I’ve indexed ~120M+ songs from the iTunes catalog with a custom AI audio model that I built for understanding music.
My model analyzes raw music audio as input and produces embedding vectors as output.
I then store the embedding vectors for all songs into a vector database, and use semantic search to find similar music!
Here are some examples you can try:
Fetish (Selena Gomez feat. Gucci Mane) — https://maroofy.com/songs/1563859943 
The Medallion Calls (Pirates of the Caribbean) — https://maroofy.com/songs/1440649752
Hope you like it, and would love to hear any questions/feedback/comments! :D

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Version 7.5 of the LibreOffice Community edition is now available.  LibreOffice is, of course, the FOSS desktop office suite; version 7.5 brings new features to multiple parts of the tool, including major improvements to dark mode, better PDF exports, improved bookmarks in Writer, data tables for charts in Calc, better interoperability with Microsoft Office, and lots more. 
Check out the release notes for further information.

LibreOffice 7.5 Community's new features have been developed by 144
contributors: 63% of code commits are from the 47 developers employed by
three companies sitting in TDF's Advisory Board - Collabora, Red Hat and
allotropia - or other organizations, 12% are from 6 developers at The
Document Foundation, and the remaining 25% are from 91 individual
volunteers.

Other 112 volunteers - representing hundreds of other people providing
translations - have committed localizations in 158 languages. LibreOffice
7.5 Community is released in 120 different language versions, more than any
other free or proprietary software, and as such can be used in the native
language (L1) by over 5.4 billion people worldwide. In addition, over 2.3
billion people speak one of those 120 languages as their second language
(L2).]]></summary>

For steam to detect my external drive I was following tutorials where I edited the fstab file but then deleted that mount point to create a new one. The next day I tried to turn my pc on but it was failing. Took a while to fix. (Atleast that’s what I think the issue was)
 I love messing up my install and debugging it and learning what I did wrong. It is so much fun to me. Also the fact that all the files are just there and you can look and see what’s up with them opens up that black box that a computer was to me when I was young. Really rewarding when you can unfuck things.
 Edit: Thanks everyone for the awesome advice.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Faith Ekstrand begins
an exploration of using the Rust language to write Vulkan graphics
drivers.



	Whenever a Vulkan object is created or destroyed, the parent object
	is passed to both the create and destroy functions. This ensures
	that the lifetime of the child object is contained within the
	lifetime of the parent object. In Rust terms, this means it's safe
	for the child object to contain a non-mutable reference to the
	parent object. Vulkan also defines which entrypoint parameters must
	be externally synchronized by the client. Externally synchronized
	objects follow the same rules as mutable references in Rust.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Version
2.37 of the GNU C Library has been released.  This looks like a
relatively low-key release, with the one "major new feature" described as:


	The getent tool now supports the --no-addrconfig option. The output
  	of getent with --no-addrconfig may contain addresses of families
  	not configured on the current host i.e. as-if you had not passed
  	AI_ADDRCONFIG to getaddrinfo calls.


There is also a security fix for CVE-2022-39046:

  When the syslog function is passed a crafted input
  string larger than 1024 bytes, it reads uninitialized memory from the
  heap and prints it to the target log file, potentially revealing a
  portion of the contents of the heap.


There is more information in the release
notes.]]></summary>

brief notice that the checksums of archives (such as tarballs)
generated by the site had just changed.  GitHub's engineers were seemingly
unaware of the consequences of such a change — consequences that were
immediately evident to anybody familiar with either packaging systems or 
Hyrum's law.  Those checksums were
widely depended on by build systems, which immediately broke when the
change went live; the resulting impact of
jawbones hitting the floor was observed by seismographs worldwide.  The
change has been reverted for now, but it is worth looking at how GitHub
managed to casually break vast numbers of build systems — and why this sort
of change will almost certainly happen again.]]></summary>

据称，微软正在努力将 OpenAI 的 ChatGPT 的更快版本（被称为 GPT-4）在未来几周内纳入它的必应搜索引擎。整合后，必应将使用 GPT-4 来回答搜索查询。GPT-4 和 ChatGPT 的主要区别在于速度，不像 ChatGPT 有时需要长达几分钟的时间来形成回应。通过使用 GPT-4，必应将能够为用户提供人性化的答案，而不是仅仅显示一个链接列表。

Twitter API 将不再提供免费访问

Twitter 宣布，从 2 月 9 日开始它的 API 将不再支持免费访问，使用其 API 将必须付费。但其尚未披露付费计划。上个月 Twitter 修改了 API 规则，明确禁止 了开发者利用其 API 开发第三方客户端，大部分第三方 Twitter 客户端已经被 杀死 了。成千上万的开发者还使用 Twitter API 建立了有关天气和信息的机器人，这些都是有趣的业余项目，但在新的政策下，这些机器人都面临关闭。该公司还没有澄清它是否也计划终止对研究人员的免费 API 使用。

AI 图像合成模型会“记忆”一点点训练图像

研究发现利用对抗性攻击，可以从“稳定扩散”等潜在扩散人工智能图像合成模型中提取一小部分训练图像。它挑战了图像合成模型不记忆其训练数据的观点，以及训练数据如果不被披露就可能保持隐私的观点。研究人员在他们测试的 35 万张高概率记忆图片中只提取到 94 个直接匹配和 109 个感知近似匹配，记忆率大约为 0.03%。另外，他们发现 “记忆” 是近似的，因为人工智能模型不能产生训练图像完全相同的精确副本。

老王点评：虽然这个比例非常小，但是如果在大量使用的情况下，可能会带来一些监管和隐私的问题。也就是说，人们希望 AI 图像合成可以做到 “意会” 而不是 “拼合”。]]></summary>

 I've been using and trying different things for an organizational purpose, there's this super simple, yet powerful tool todotxt which I used a while and left it because of missing things such as reminder, calendar, scheduling etc...
 Now I figured out there is a 'remind' tool which is pretty old, and missing some features such as nice gui so I can overview it from my phone (eg. if its a website gui) or integration with external calendars (e.g. google calendar)...
 Remind release binaries are from 2002 :-) 
 anyways, my question is... is there more tools to recommend in this class, simple and powerful to consider ?
 Thanks!!

There’s an increasing desire in commercial open source about “maintaining control” e.g. defining exactly what binaries are shipping to users. Not supporting users (or even software distributions) to build-from-source is antithetical to the values of open source. If you think Homebrew's perspective is annoying on this: try and see how Debian responds to requests to ship your binaries.
  
But I would assume that Debian doesn't wanna ship user-created binaries because they might contain malware. They'd prefer to let software hosted by their OS-default repositories only contain code they or their people have vetted.
 Am I understanding this wrong? I want more history context or explanation. Because right now I agree with the way that I think debian is.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[体验为开源做出贡献的快乐。


难以用言语形容我在收到合并通知（如下图）时的喜悦，当然这要归功于现在我上的工程学校 AltSchool Africa。



在此之前，我曾多次接触过开源的概念，了解了它在技术领域的重要性，甚至参加过开源会议（比如 OSCAFest）。我曾多次跃跃欲试，但当打开 GitHub 来想创建些东西时，冒名顶替综合症就会冒出来。

时间来到 2022 年 8 月 8 日星期一，当观看了 Bolaji 为开源做贡献的视频之后，我重新振奋起来。不过，想要把我学到的东西付诸实践，我注意到需要下面几个步骤：

步骤：


我要下定决心，做好为一个开源项目做出贡献的心理建设。

我要根据我的技能水平进行筛选，我从一个站点（Good First Issues）寻找我开始的第一个项目。我不停地往下翻看，直到找到了一个符合心意的项目。

我要确定自己掌握完成项目所需的 Git 和 GitHub 知识。



LCTT 译注：

“Good First Issues” 这个网站主要是针对那些想为开源软件做贡献，但不知道从哪里开始或如何开始的开发者。通过为开发者提供过滤器，该网站使他们能够根据自己熟悉的编程语言来浏览和选择问题和存储库。此外，他们还可以选择他们想要解决的问题的类型。


项目

经过长时间查找，我终于找到了一个名为 确保没有缺失的 alt 属性 的项目。我所要做的，就是为网站上的图片提供描述性的 alt 值。图片的 alt 值有助于提高网站的辅助功能，这样屏幕阅读器就可以向视障人士提供图像的详细描述了。这很简单，对吧？是的，但假如我没有下定决心想要作出贡献，我就不会找到这项目，在我心中开源仍将是个神话。

我心潮澎湃，直到发现这个项目是来自 MDN 的。等等，MDNMozzila 开发者网络？干和 Mozilla 的开发者一样的事儿？他们会合并我这么小儿科的贡献吗？冒名顶替综合症 又开始了。

在检查这个议题时，我看到有人已经在提交贡献了，于是我鼓起勇气开始翻阅项目的内容。阅读和理解这个项目颇花费了我一些时间，而另一个要克服的，就是清楚处理这个议题我要怎么做。

这个项目就像你想的那么简单。

于是，我挑选了两幅图片着手尝试。我给它们的 alt 属性赋值，提交我的更改，然后发出拉取请求。从提交请求到收到批准邮件的这段时间，我充满了自我怀疑。我要不要关闭拉取请求？这可是 MDN 啊。好吧，这甚至都不算编程…… 如果请求没有被合并怎么办？我恐怕再也不会想为开源做出贡献了。不过，所有的疑虑都在我看到审阅者发来的这些邮件时烟消云散：







我喜出望外，这激发了我去检查更多图片的热情，也给了我发请求解决其他议题所需的勇气。



总结

我希望你能从这篇文章中感受到以下几点：


开源是面向所有人的。你在刚刚访问的那个网站上看到拼写错误了吗？你帮助订正了拼写错误，这就是为开源做出了贡献。

没有任何技能是微不足道的。如你所见，我所做出的贡献，只需要对 HTML 最基本的了解。

能阻止你做出贡献的只有你自己。

要想让雪球滚起来，需要做的就只是提交第一个贡献。


我衷心希望你能从我的经历中获得什么，并且今天就付诸实践。这也就是我想贡献的另一个领域，那么，我们下一篇文章见，也祝你开源愉快！

 Key points to take away: 
  
Linux overall percentage has not changed this month
 Steam OS percentage is going down and other distros are going up. 
 Every other result is still f****d due to the existence of the steam deck
 Intel CPU slightly up
 Steam deck GPU slightly down
 
 I think points 2,4 and 5 indicate a few people are actually slowly trying Linux on their desktop.

当代著名的政治思想家朱迪丝·N.施克莱（Judith N. Shklar）的论文和著作的核心议题之一是对社会压迫与政治不公正的关注，而且具有很强的现实针对性和实践性；在她看来，“政治理论原本就是用来争论和说服的”。近日读她的专著《不正义的多重面孔》（The Faces of Injustice, Yale University Press，1990；钱一栋，上海人民出版社，2020 年4月），更深感在她政治理论中的那种争论与说服的力量令人折服：不仅是因为她的论述所具有的深刻的思想性和敏锐的现实感，也是因为如约翰·格雷（John Gray）所说的那种言述品格：敏锐、富于层次、深具心理洞察力、对自身处境的历史意识以及带有反讽和怀疑主义色彩的写作风格。令人感慨的是，这种言说品格在当今舆论场中尤其显得稀缺和珍贵。
该书缘起于1988年施克莱在耶鲁大学法学院的斯托尔斯法理学讲座，成文后保留了在对话中的思考与争论的风格，其核心议题是在政治理论研究中被忽视的重要概念“不正义”的多重性及其在现实中的呈现。值得注意的是，她强调以美国为对象，不仅因为她最了解美国，而且她认为“在写作不正义这个话题时，人们最好还是指责自己的国家”（12页）。同时还有的一层意思是，她所讨论的“消极不正义”主要指的并不是对他人苦难的习惯性冷漠，而是一种公民失败（civic failure）：没能阻止私人的和公共的不正义之举。说这是一种“公民失败”，是因为“与弥漫恐惧的威权社会中的情形相比，在自由社会，这种防御性公民活动的实现可能性要大得多，所以我应该把它视为仅适用于立宪民主国家的公民义务的一个方面”（11-12页）。仅此已经很值得我们深思。她在一处注释中也谈到，“显然，我是在这样一种社会语境中讨论正…]]></summary>

因为《风俗与历史观》的中文结集问世，岸本美绪先生的研究在中国引发了更大范围的关注。如果说这种关注，不仅是出自对史家智慧的折服，对明清历史的好奇，恐怕就还有著作中蕴涵的一种情感或者说是“感觉”的力量。由情成法、入理，足以动人。
深化中国历史研究中的“风俗”概念，使其在机理上更为周详紧密，在功能上更具有分析概念和方法的分量；在世界史、比较史的格局中观察明清时代动态往复中的社会现象；通过名片、老爷、抬头、买卖、契约等微观研究，进入诸如“后十六世纪的共通问题”的宏观统合，达致对明清时代的中国与世界之社会秩序问题的新体会。这样的学术贡献是精到、见功力而多面相的，富有方法启发，但终究不是岸本史学之全部。
岸本先生自述“同根的问题关心”是“依据当时人的想法，具体地厘清他们如何因应变动的经济状况来选择自身的行动”，“依据当时人的思考理路去理解明清时代的社会现象”。“当时人”是其大者，但斯世持此理路为研究准绳者并不少见，与“以欧洲历史为基础抽取出来的宏大理论”指引下的研究已成二水分流之势。更重要、更有区分度和触动感的，也许是“具体地”三个字。包括岸本先生所言“了解当时的人们如何看待地方官、如何想象国家”“探寻当时的人们——买卖与诉讼的当事人，以及相关的官僚们——想法背后的逻辑”。“具体地”背后是历史学家平等的身份观念和身份感觉，这里移用岸本先生对“身份”和“身份感觉”的重视来形容其本人。她曾说地域社会论的研究者“企图站在这一社会偏僻角落的行为者的视角来观察问题”，这就是后代历史学家与古代的老爷和小民平等而非俯视的站位。这是一种理性的学术方法，也是感性上的自然与当然，是非常具体的“个人主义”的社会感觉：

 My experience is that both Lenovo thinkpad and regular works quite well. ASUS have been mostly problematic especially the microphone. What are your experiences?
 Other general tips are welcome too like if those components have better compatibility: Intel/AMD/Nvidia or Intel/Broadcom/Qualcomm.

has been released.



	We’re particularly excited to launch a preview of profile-guided
	optimization (PGO), which enables the compiler to perform
	application- and workload-specific optimizations based on run-time
	profile information. Providing a profile to go build enables the
	compiler to speed up typical applications by around 3–4%, and we
	expect future releases to benefit even more from PGO. Since this is
	a preview release of PGO support, we encourage folks to try it out,
	but there are still rough edges which may preclude production use.

	Go 1.20 also includes a handful of language changes, many
	improvements to tooling and the library, and better overall
	performance.]]></summary>

We heard from a lot of people that the biggest thing holding them back from starting a company was that they didn't want to do it alone and didn't have any friends who wanted to do it with them.
So we built a site that's similar to a dating site but for co-founders, and launched it on HN: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=27750298.
Like any new product, we weren't sure how well this would work.  Other people had tried this idea before, and none of them had really taken off.  But we thought YC had some unique advantages in doing it.
Fast forward to now, and frankly it's worked better than we dared hope.  In the first two years, YC has invested in dozens of companies that came from people meeting each other on the s…]]></summary>

detailed article on work being done to ensure the integrity of the

	As you may know, traditional firmware security measures like UEFI
	Secure Boot and measured boot, even with a Static Root of Trust
	(SRT), may only sometimes be enough to ensure a completely secure
	environment for your operating system. Compromised firmware may
	allow for the injection of malicious software into your system,
	making it difficult to detect. To overcome these limitations, many

Anyway, I've been looking at the immutable distros out there because later Win10 and WIn11 are disgusting me so much I want to get my less technical family off of them. Problem is, I'm not sure there's a terribly good landing spot. I figure if I give them something immutable it'll be a lot harder for them to break, right? Especially clicking on pop-ups, you know how it goes. 
 Obviously the big one out there is Fedora Silverblue...two problems with it though. One, it's GNOME, which isn't all that Windows-like. I like it personally but it might be harder for someone coming from Windows, learning-curve wise, and the idea is to NOT frustrate people back over to Windows. Kinoite might work out better, but then we get to the second problem: Fedora is religious about offering free software only. So certain codecs and such are missing. That won't do.
 VanillaOS is up and coming and seems more relaxed...but again, GNOME. 
 I'd like to see a more relaxed option out there that uses KDE, or maybe Cinnamon, and I'm wondering why none have popped up yet. I do think if Linux desktops are going to get anywhere it's going to be a situation where you give them a read-only system and let them use Flatpaks. Of course, if nothing's out there I might just have to give them an Endeavour or Mint setup without sudo access, but then they wouldn't be able to update the system, so that's not really a fix. 
 This has been turning around in my head for a while and I just wanted to put it out there. I think there's room for more (and more diverse) immutable offerings out there.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[OpenAI 发布检测 AI 生成文本的工具

ChatGPT 的创造者 OpenAI 今天发布了一个免费的基于网络的工具，旨在帮助弄清某块文本是由人类还是机器写的。OpenAI 警告说，该工具并不完美，可能会有“误判和漏判”，不应该单独依靠新工具来确定文件的作者身份。它在大于 1000 字的文本样本和英语中效果最好，但它还不能区分人类和人工智能编写的计算机代码。


消息来源：Axios



老王点评：以子之矛，攻子之盾。我敢说，这个工具肯定会利用来改善 AI 的输出，使之更不容易识别出来。




万维网联盟以公益性非营利组织重启

万维网联盟（W3C）是 Web 发明人蒂姆·伯纳斯-李创立于 1994 年的行业组织，它为互联网制定了包括 HTML 和 CSS 等近 500 个开放标准，整个 Web 世界都是在此基础上发展起来的。W3C 的标准可以被任何人使用，而且由于 W3C 专利政策免收版税，所以不需要任何费用。2023 年伊始，W3C 联盟成立了一个新的符合美国 501(c)(3) 的公益性非营利组织。虽然蒂姆爵士已经逐渐退出了大多数 W3C 的决策，但在 W3C 董事会中为他保留了一个永久席位。


消息来源：W3C



老王点评：W3C 确实很有功绩，成为非营利组织后应该可以发挥更大的作用。




谷歌决定在 2024 年禁止第三方 Cookie

尽管存在争议和来自政府的审查，但这家广告公司仍打算继续推进其基于兴趣的广告主题 API。谷歌在报告中说，“在 2024 年第三季度，Chrome 浏览器将在两个月内逐步取消对第三方 Cookie 的支持。”此前，谷歌最早曾打算在 2022 年底前废弃对第三方 Cookie 的支持。为了取代第三方 Cookie，谷歌早在 2019 年就宣布了“隐私沙盒”技术，并正在开发一系列取代性技术，如主题 API、FLEDGE API、归属报告 API、私有状态令牌 API、第一方集 API 等等。谷歌坚持认为其广告技术工具可以在支持开放网络的同时促进隐私。


消息来源：The Register



老王点评：或许一部分初衷是好的，但是打击对手的心思怕也是有的，大部分数字广告商都还必须依赖第三方 Cookie。]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[关于安装和使用 Fedora Media Writer 从 Linux 和 Windows 创建立付 USB 的教程。




Fedora Media Writer

社区和 Fedora Linux 团队开发并维护了 Fedora Media Writer 应用。这个应用可以将任何 ISO 镜像写入你的闪存盘（U 盘）中。此外，Fedora Media Writer 还有直接从 Fedora 镜像中下载 ISO 文件的功能，前提是你有一个稳定的互联网连接。

此外，它还为你提供了一个下载选项列表：比如官方版本、新兴版本、定制版和实验室版本的镜像。

不仅如此，你还可以使用这个灵巧的工具将任何其他 ISO 镜像写入你的闪存。它不总是需要 Fedora ISO。

虽然有其他流行的工具可以用来创建 立付Live USB ，比如 Etcher、Ventoy 和 Rufus，但考虑到该团队是从主流 Fedora Linux 与贡献者一起开发的，你仍然可以尝试使用此程序。


LCTT 译注：特此说明一下使用 “立付” 一词作为 “Live” 的中文翻译。

Live 原意多指“现场”、“实时”，在计算机环境中使用时也多引用此意。但对它的翻译就颇费神，因为无论是在 Live Patch，还是更多见的 Live USB/CD、Live Session，其实都不好翻译为“现场”、“实时”。

提议者之前曾经尝试创造了新的“临场”词汇，但是感觉有些不够达意。经过推敲，提议者再次推荐使用“立付”，在照顾发音的同时，取其“立时交付”之意。这样，Live USB/CD 可以译做 “立付 USB/CD”，Live Session 可以译做 “立付会话”。

详见我们发布的《LCTT 术语词典》。


因此，综上所述，这里是 Fedora Media Writer 的…]]></summary>

ChatGPT 是一个在当下十分流行的聊天机器人，它可以与用户进行互动，用户就像在对话一样。

最近，关于 ChatGPT 的新闻时常出现在人们的视野之中，有时是关于 ChatGPT 的坏消息。

不难看出，ChatGPT 有其两面性。事实上，对于任何人工智能的实现都同样如此。

一方面，ChatGPT 这一工具的巨大潜力给许多人留下了深刻的印象。但另一方面，因人们对它的滥用/误用，导致 ChatGPT 在科技界引起了轩然大波。

人们对 ChatGPT 滥用/误用太多了，以至于其创建者 OpenAI 开发了一种工具来检测 ChatGPT 的使用情况，这个内容可以进一步访问 此网页。

现在，我注意到在一个 Reddit 讨论中，一位开发人员提到了一些有趣的事情。

一个用户名为 HorrorPills 的开发人员已经开始为 ChatGPT 开发 GNOME 扩展。

这听起来非常有趣，让我们继续来看看吧。

这个扩展仍在开发中：让我们持续保持关注吧！



这是一个 GNOME 桌面扩展，将 ChatGPT 添加到了桌面的 系统托盘system tray 中。

现在，这个 GNOME 桌面扩展还处于未完成的状态，它已经具有了基本的功能，但仍存在一些错误。

正如它的开发者 所说 的那样：

你需要有一个 ChatGPT 帐户，才能使用这个扩展程序，并且需要用到你的键盘，才能进行定位，因为现在这个扩展的光标功能还有很多问题。

此外，这个扩展对 GNOME 43 的支持也很不完整，他们提供了一个临时的修复程序，并将这个进一步完善的任务添加到此扩展的后续开发中。

如果你喜欢的话，你可以试试这个扩展。你可以通过它的 GitHub 仓库，来获取运行它所需的所有说明和文件。

它的开发人员还 表示：当这个扩展变得更加稳定时，他们会将这个扩展发布到 GNOME 扩展 网站 上去。

此外，开发人员还 透露：他们在未来可能会实现 KDE Plasma 的 ChatGPT 扩展。

拉丁美洲无论就自然风光还是历史文化而言都是个迷人的地方，但无论对中国知识界还是普通读者而言，拉丁美洲环境史都是一个几乎完全陌生的领域。这当然与拉丁美洲环境史研究的现状有关。在英语世界的拉丁美洲环境史研究中，迄今为止，仅仅出版了三本以拉丁美洲为研究对象的环境史著作，分别是2004年由ABC-CLIO出版、由Kevin Hillstrom和Laurie Collier Hillstrom主编的《拉丁美洲和加勒比：一个大陆的环境问题概况》（Latin America and the Caribbean: A Continental Overview of Environmental Issues），2007年由剑桥大学出版社出版、Shawn William Miller撰写的《拉丁美洲环境史》（An Environmental History of Latin America），2018年在纽约出版、由John Soluri, Claudia Leal和José Augusto Pádua主编的《鲜活的历史：现代拉丁美洲环境史》（A Living Past: Environmental Histories of Modern Latin America）。《拉丁美洲和加勒比：一个大陆的环境问题概况》虽然位列《自然与社会》系列丛书，但与该系列中其他地区的书名都以环境史命名相比，这本书的书名却很独特。它不是从历史角度来分析拉丁美洲人与环境关系的变化，而是从科学家的视角出发描述了拉丁美洲环境问题（人口和土地利用，生物多样性，保护区和国家公园，森林，农业，淡水，海洋和海岸带，能源和运输，空气质量和大气，环境行动主义）的现状。《鲜活的历史：现代拉丁…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey HN! About a year ago i stumbled upon the world of swords, knives, and EDC gear. A weirdly addicting (and expensive) hobby to have.
Back then i noticed something, it was quite tedious to easily sift and search through knives based on length, steel, brand, and what not to find the knife for me. There were some great youtube channels that helped me pick out what i wanted however i had to sit through multiple 30 minute videos just to review 10-15 knives or so each.
Recently i've been having a little trouble sleeping so i decided to pickup a new passion project to work on late at night, here's KnifeGeek!
it's a completely free website where you can search, filter, and sift through an extensive knife database (over 60K+ knives) and add them to your collection or wishlist. You do need to sign in to add stuff to your wishlist or collection and after a bunch of advanced searches.
Please check it out and let me know if you think anything is missing! I'll try to flesh it out more on a daily basis if people find it cool or useful.
Planning to add in price comparison functionality and more data per knife in the next week.
PS: Images are a little shoddy, working on that.

detailed document describing the work to improve  safety of
flexible-length arrays 
in the kernel.


	Converting such codebases to use “modern” language features, like
	those in C99 (still from the prior millennium), can be a major
	challenge, but it is an entirely tractable problem. This post is a
	deep dive into an effort underway in the Linux kernel to make array
	index overflows (and more generally, buffer overflows) a thing of
	the past, where they belong. Our success hinges on replacing
	anachronistic array definitions with well-defined C99 flexible
	arrays.


This work has been covered here as well.]]></summary>

> Your private repository baobabKoodaa/laaketutka-scripts (forked from futurice/how-to-get-healthy) has been deleted because you are no longer a collaborator on futurice/how-to-get-healthy.
That was an MIT-licensed open source project I worked on years ago. We published the source code for everyone to use, so I certainly did not expect to lose access to it just because someone at my previous company has been doing spring cleaning at GitHub! I had a 100% legal fork of the project, and now it's gone... why?
Turns out I don't even have a local copy of it anymore, so this actually caused me data loss. I'm fine with losing access to this particular codebase, I'm not using HN as customer support to regain access. I just wanted everyone to be aware that GitHub does this.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Last December, Heroku nuked the database on one of my active projects.  I was travelling at the end of the year and did not catch wind of this until I returned and saw messages about an issue with the app.  Sure enough, I checked and noticed that the database was gone and detached on December 9th.
Before the hate comes out, yes I know Heroku deprecated free tiers.  However, I did not understand this would affect my projects on paid dynos.  The real issue here is that I never received a single email or notice of any kind to my email about this.  From researching, it appears most people received SEVERAL notices about this.  I did not think there was an issue with my setup because I received zero communication.
Upon reaching out, Heroku has told me that they cannot recover the database.  They also admitted that there was "an issue" sending out notifications to me, and confirmed that none were sent.
So I guess just a warning to all - your database might be nuked at any time.  I learned my lesson about not doing an offsite backup regularly.  I guess the bigger lesson though is that Heroku should really be a last resort option for projects these days. RIP.

Needl is a single search bar for all your apps that lets you find any document, message, or file you need. Here’s a demo video: https://www.loom.com/share/652ae56c8ee34bc2a84b8aacf479a9f4.
We’ve all struggled to find information and couldn’t remember if it was shared over Gmail or Slack or Notion. Most of us have hundreds of thousands of emails, documents, messages, etc., and only a small fraction are actually useful. Internal search is even harder than web search in some ways: with web search, there are dozens of right answers and millions of previous searches to train ranking models, but internally (i.e. on your own data), there is only one right answer and limited training data.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In Go, Java, Node.js, Python, Ruby, etc.. you have dependency management solutions.
 The idea is every project wraps its output into an artefact, this is pushed into a central repository (Maven Central, NPM Registry, Ruby Gems, etc..).
 The build management system can extract the artifact contents and link against the contents. To compile your application, which you package and deploy to the artefact repository.
 Considering how much energy has gone into packaging systems and alternative routes, I don't understand why no one has tried this now standard software development approach.
 I figure the only technical objection is about C/C++ being platform specific and the artefacts it can produce. However:
  
Apache Maven is aware of the operating system and architecture for those terrible Java developers who make OS specific code. 
 NPM and PiP both have dependencies with C libraries (SSL is an obvious one) and are OS aware.
  
I figure C devs might complain their project in what it produces. At this I would refer to Node.JS developers who produce all sorts of madness and the artefact is still usable accross projects.
 This approach happened years after apt and rpm were developed, but more than a decade before Snaps & Flatpak which aim to overcome how painful it is to use deb/rpm.
 My issue with Snaps and Flatpak is to reduce image size you can now reference libraries which install as snaps/flatpaks. Which is an incredibly heavyweight means of pulling down libraries.
 Lastly having written RPM/Deb specs for Java, Node.JS and Python projects its actually really easy to pull the dependency management and build information to auto populate most of it for you.
 It just boggles me the open source movement has spent so much energy not doing the obvious thing.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[魔兽世界作为一个有着十多年历史前的老游戏，拥有极为海量的内容，可玩性很高，至今的游戏热度居高不下。随着魔兽世界国服的暂停，老玩家面临无法玩魔兽世界的状况，然而，没有人能剥夺玩家玩游戏的权力，这里就介绍一下魔兽世界外服的玩法。


游戏服务器的选择


除了中国之外，暴雪游戏在全世界都是直营销售，因此在外服不存在代理商搞事的情况，可以放心玩，目前玩家可以选择的外服有亚服和美服，玩家可以根据网络延迟情况来选择服务器。


游戏延迟在魔兽世界主界面右下角，鼠标移动到右下角图标处可以显示延迟，魔兽世界的延迟分为本地延迟和世界延迟，两者的区别有：含义不同、对宽带需求不同、延迟的产生原因不同。


1、含义不同


本地延迟，表示到服务器的连接。这个连接发送数据，比如聊天数据，拍卖所数据，工会聊天和工会信息，某些插件数据和多种其他数据。


世界延迟，表示服务器传输所有其他数据的连接。比如战斗数据，身边的玩家(他们的天赋，装备，附魔等等)，NPC，怪物，施法，专业等。


2、对宽带需求不同


本地延迟，这个连接对带宽的需求和占用都是很小的。


世界延迟，需要连接服务器较多，对宽带的占用较大。


3、延迟的产生原因不同


本地延迟高有时是在最初几次进入游戏中的地图和场景时，可能需要下载额外的数据和文件，等待这些文件和数据下载完毕，会出现高延迟等问题。


世界延迟常见原因有电脑配置方面，网卡性能差，造成网络丢包问题；线路方面是入户前的线路质量不好引起的延迟高，这种情况只能联系运行商。


经过实地测试，对于沿海省份来说，亚服的延迟大概是100-200ms左右，基本符合正常使用需求，如果有PVP需求的话，那就要使用加速软件，延迟能降低到50ms左右。当然延迟还是比国服高，国服的延迟在10-20ms左右。美服的延迟大概在400ms…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Now hear me out!
 During the last couple of weeks, ever since the 6.1.4 kernel release, I've been noticing an ever increasing amount of problems, both with past linux installs, as well as brand new ones. Furthermore, it seems that switching to the LTS kernel (5.15) fixes them all.
 Now, I'm not asking for help on the issues, i just want to know if other people have noticed similiar increase in bugs, in the last couple of kernel releases?
 Sometimes it's suspend, sometimes it's networkmanager, and sometimes it's something else completely... the glitches seems rather random, but one thing is guaranteed, switching to the lts kernel resolves them all, and only gives me the issues i would expect from the lts kernel (since it's not really made for a modern gaming laptop)
 So if you experience this behavour, please let me know... It makes debugging a bit easier, if i know it's a general thing, and not just my sys being weird.
 ​
 Edit: It's worth mentioning that in the 5 years I've been using linux, on 7 different computers, and 3 servers, I've never had this many issues getting a kernel to run stable. The most profound issue is the ram consumption (the actual one, not that cache one) constantly increasing, and not dropping as i close my programs. I once experienced 23GB of actual ram consumption, on a system that did nothing... The DE wasn't even loaded, it was just sitting in the tty

Yandex 的搜索引擎使用了 1922 个排名因子

Yandex 搜索引擎的源代码最近被前雇员泄露。根据分析，它的搜索排名算法使用了 1922 个排名因子。即便 Yandex 不是谷歌，但 Yandex 和谷歌的排名因子肯定有很多相似之处。Yandex 的排名因子包括 PageRank 和链接相关因子、文本相关性、内容年龄和新鲜度，终端用户行为信号、主机可靠性、维基百科等网站高优先度，等等。

老王点评：这种靠排名因子来列出搜索结果的做法，现在和 ChatGPT 等 AI 相比，感觉太机械、太手工、太落后了。




GIMP 3.0.0 有望在年内发布

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[本文收录了 LCTT 自创和选用的翻译词汇。

为什么要自创翻译词汇？在翻译过程中，我们发现一些非缩写的英语术语沿袭使用了英语单词/短语，而没有得体的、公认的、正式的对应中文翻译。我们认为，中英文混杂是对原生语言的一种污染（英文缩写除外，这是为了减少冗长的语句），按照本地化的宗旨，应该对这些词汇进行翻译，并在必要时创造新的词汇。故此，我们在几年的翻译中，逐渐推敲和形成了一些新的译法，并在我们翻译的文章中使用和推广。

对这些译法，我们尽量遵循“信达雅”的原则。但鉴于水平所及，肯定会有所不足，虽然也有不断的调整和改进，但仍希望得到大家的反馈和指正。

我们采用的方法是：


音似：中文读音近似于英文原词

意近：中文字的意思接近英文原意

组词：根据上述两条组成新的词汇，以避免和原有词汇混淆


此外，需要说明的是，有些译法可能已经被其他人在别的地方更早提出，但限于我们的学识和搜索能力，并未发现和了解到，并非我们故意剽窃。

顺便说一句，2014 年对 “Shebang”（#!）一词翻译时，来自于 LCTT 早期重要贡献者 GOLinux 提出的 “释伴” 译法，是我们第一次创造新的翻译词汇，也是我们形成这样的想法的起点。

除了自创的翻译词汇外，这里还收录了一些选用的翻译词汇。有一些词汇存在多种译法，我们在翻译和使用过程中，采用了某个译法，在此列出以保持一致。

F

Fork

Fork 行为/操作广泛用于进程管理、版本管理和软件衍生方面。此词汇也长期缺乏确定的译法。

此前，提议者对 Fork 给出了 “复刻” 的译法。基本意思是，根据上游/父本复制一份，然后在此基础上进行修改，从而形成“衍生品”。

有趣的是，我们发现 GitHub 的 部分中文文档 中也采用了此译法，不知道是不是受到了我们的影响。

《探索与反讽：暹罗研究四十年》（下文简称《探索与反讽》）是本尼迪克特·安德森在泰学研究领域多年成果的文集，书中所收录的文章跨度长达四十年之久，期间有十八年左右的空白期（1993-2011）。这段空白也正好可以作为本尼迪克特对泰国研究关注点的分水岭：1977年到1993年间所发表的文章，核心皆在讨论泰国的政治局势、社会问题以及造成这些局面的可能的历史原因；2011年后，本尼迪克特对泰国的研究兴趣投向了在泰华人华裔陆津（luk jin）的认同。2014年他应邀在清华大学做演讲时，讲的第二个题目就是《东南亚华人的认同悖论——以泰国为例》。这两个阶段在某种意义上也分别对应了书名中的两个关键词：1993年之前是本尼迪克特对泰国和泰学研究的探索时期，而2011年之后，他观察到泰国社会中充满了矛盾和讽刺。

本尼迪克特·安德森

本书前两篇文章——《对泰国国家的研究：泰学研究的现状》（下文简称《泰学研究现状》以及《撤军症候：1976年10月6日争辩的社会和文化面向》（下文简称《撤军症候》）正是笔者在清迈大学教授《泰国社会与文化》（Thai Society and Culture）课程的必读选材。这门课是清迈大学历史系开设的供全校本科生选修的通识课，是多年来的“明星通识课”，之前只针对泰国学生，近两年增加了面向国际生的英语授课部分。尽管数年来多任教师已对教学大纲以及课程设置做过若干次提炼改进，这两篇完成于上世纪七十年代末的文章仍被视作重中之重。
首先《泰学研究现状》在泰国研究领域带来的革新意义，不亚于本尼迪克特的《想象的共同体》之于民族主义研究。比《泰学研究现状》早一年发表的《撤军症候》则是本尼迪克特在泰学领域初试牛刀，以1976年10月泰国法政大学大屠杀事件作为切入…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[无论你使用的是 while 循环、do/while 循环，还是无限循环，了解循环的工作原理对 Java 编程至关重要。


只要某些预定的条件为真，一个 while 循环就会执行一组任务。这被认为是一个控制结构，可以指导程序的流程。它是一种你可以通过定义一个条件来告诉你的代码要做什么的方法，它可以测试它，并根据它发现的情况采取行动。Java 中的两种 while 循环是 while 和 do/while。

Java while 循环

while 循环的目的是对数据进行迭代，直到某个条件得到满足。要创建一个 while 循环，你需要提供一个可以测试的条件，然后是你想要运行的代码。Java 有几个内置的测试函数，其中最简单的是数学运算符（<, >, ==, 等等）：

package com.opensource.example;

public class Example {
  public static void main(String[] args) {

  int count = 0;
  while (count < 5) {
    System.out.printf("%d ", count);
    count++;
    }
  }
}


在这个简单的例子中，条件是变量 count 小于 5。因为 count 被实例化为 0，然后在 while 循环的代码中增加 1，所以程序总共迭代了 5 次：

$ java ./while.java
0 1 2 3 4


在它进行第六次迭代之前，条件不再是真的，所以循环结束。

while 循环的条件语句是至关重要的。弄错了可能意味着你的循环永远不会执行。例如，假设你把 count == 5 作为条件：

while (count == 5) {

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm not entirely clear on the current release process for new Linux kernel versions, but something struck me earlier today: It seemslike Linus Thorvalds is a massive Single Point of Failure in the current release process Lots of people and organisations provide massive contributions to the Linux kernel and core subsystem maintainers perform the bulk of the work on reviewing these contributions, but as I understand it, Linus is pretty much alone in handling the merge window where these contributions are included into the mainline kernel and both release candidates and final releases are made. So what would the consequences be, if Linus Thorvalds suddenly got hit by a bus and died, or suffered a stroke and became completely incapacitated for a year or more?

- Apply the stability guarantees starting with the most recent publication (draft 2020-12) so that the next publication contains no breaking changes.

        <link href="https://lwn.net/Articles/921646/"/>
        <updated>2023-01-30T16:28:53.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Over at Linux.com, Yocto Project architect Richard Purdie  writes about various kinds of problems that the project is experiencing, some of which stem from its success and growth.  It is a story that will likely resonate with other open-source projects.


Our scale also means patch requirements are more demanding now. Once, when the number of people using the project was small, the impact of breaking things was also more limited, allowing a little more freedom in development. Now, if we accept a change commit and something breaks, it becomes an instant emergency, and I’m generally expected to resolve it. When patches come from trusted sources, help will often be available to address the regressions as part of an unwritten bond between developers and maintainers. This can intimidate new contributors; they can also find our testing requirements too difficult.

We did have tooling to help new contributors—and also the maintainers—by spotting simple, easily detected errors in incoming patches. This service would test and then reply to patches on the mailing list with pointers on how to fix the patches, freeing maintainer time and helping newcomers. Sadly, such tools require maintenance, and we lost the people who knew how to look after this component, so it stopped working. We formed plans to bring it back and make the maintenance easier, but we’ve struggled to find anyone with the time to do it. I’ve wondered if I should personally try to do it; however, I just can’t spend the chunk of time needed on one thing like that, as I would neglect too many other things for too long.]]></summary>

where a handful of people have the key, then cloud-based environments are like
apartment complexes that offer both higher density and greater flexibility,
but which include more key holders and potential entry points. The importance
of protecting virtual machines (VMs) running in these environments — from
both the host and other tenants — has become increasingly clear.

        <id>https://www.williamlong.info/archives/7068.html</id>
        <link href="https://www.williamlong.info/archives/7068.html"/>
        <updated>2023-01-30T14:46:32.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[1月30日，中国消费者协会网站发布《2022年十大消费维权舆情热点》，其中“网络游戏停服删档可能造成的消费者权益受损”也入选了这份榜单，位列第十。南都此前报道，今年春节期间，暴雪国服正式停服成为热议话题，退款、进度存档等后续安排也曾登上微博热搜。


中消协报告称，近年来，一些运营不当的网络游戏“停服删档”引发虚拟财产纠纷，导致消费者投诉的事件屡屡发生，并引发舆论关注。2022年2月，手游《云裳羽衣》停止运营引发大量消费者不满，中消协介入后，该游戏运营方中止了停服流程。同年10月下旬，媒体报道了一起“男子起诉游戏运营商停服案”，该事件中，北京互联网法院判定手游运营商具有过错，应按照玩家充值金额的一定比例进行赔偿。同年11月下旬，“网易与暴雪停止合作”事件，也引发舆论对拥有庞大玩家群体的《魔兽世界》《炉石传说》等游戏可能因“停服”导致消费者权益受损隐患的关注。相关案例中，争议的焦点主要在于，大多数游戏在停服后会删除与游戏相关的数据存档，被质疑侵犯游戏玩家的权益。并且，一些游戏运营方提出的补偿措施，大多是引流至公司其他游戏的礼包或福利，这又导致消费者质疑所谓的补偿方案是游戏运营商换一种方式“割韭菜”。舆论认为，消费者的权益不能“想删就删”，网络游戏运营方在调整经营策略时，须尊重消费者意愿，选择消费者可接受的方式。相关法律法规也应不断完善，为消费者的虚拟财产筑起坚实的保护墙，更好地为消费者放心消费保驾护航。


记者注意到，作为去年影响范围最大、最受公众关注的网游停服事件，“暴雪国服停服”的影响持续至今。去年11月17日，美国游戏公司动视暴雪突然宣布，其与网易的现有授权协议将到期，其间双方谈判未成，今年1月24日0时，由网易旗下公司网之易代理的《魔兽世界》《炉石传说》《守望先锋》等暴雪系列游戏产品在中国大陆地区正式终止运营。同日，网之易发布《关于暴雪游戏产品退款安排的初步说明》称，计划针对玩家在游戏内已充值但未消耗的虚拟货币，或未失效的游戏服务，开放退款申请。预计将于2月1日开放退款申请通道，支持“全现金、全平台”退款。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[甲骨文新的授权模式导致 Java 使用成本激增

甲骨文公司修改了 Oracle Java SE 订阅模式，在新的模式下，Java 将按每个员工授权，而不是像旧模式允许的那样按每个用户或每个处理器授权。尽管甲骨文公司承诺允许用户可以根据他们目前的订阅模式进行续约，但随着时间的推移，它可能会对用户施加压力，让他们采用新的模式。这种转变将惩罚那些花了多年时间尽量减少 Java 使用量的公司，因为他们发现无论他们使用多少Java，都要按员工收费。有分析称，有的公司的 Java 成本上升了 10 倍，平均在 2 到 4 倍的增长。


消息来源：The Register



老王点评：是时候抛弃甲骨文的 Java 了。




GitHub 用户数突破 1 亿

成立于 2008 年的 GitHub 宣布，现在有 1 亿名开发者在使用该平台。与 GitHub 十年前的 300 万用户、五年前微软以 75 亿美元收购它时声称的 2800 万用户，以及三个月前透露的 9000 多万用户相比，这一数字有了大幅提升。在 2019 年的一次主题演讲中，其前 CEO 说，该公司的目标是到 2025 年达到 1 亿名开发者，所以实际上是提前两年达成了目标。


消息来源：Tech Crunch



老王点评：要不是在某些地方访问 GitHub 经常性抽风，可能 GitHub 能更快完成这一目标吧。




ChatGPT 在寻找和解决程序错误方面表现优异

研究人员将 40 段有错误的代码交给四个不同的代码修复系统：ChatGPT、Codex、CoCoNut 和标准 APR（自动程序修复）。在第一轮测试中，ChatGPT 解决了 19 个问题，Codex 解决了 21 个，CoCoNut 解决了 19 个，而标准 APR 方法则解决了 7 个。然而，通过和 ChatGPT 对话，提供了有关问题和错误的更多信息后，最终 ChatGPT 解决了 31 个问题。


消息来源：《PC 杂志》



老王点评：看看，不仅仅能写程序，还能替你挑错，甚至修改错误，所以，程序员们可能真的快被淘汰了。]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[想让你的终端有一个复古的外观？本指南将帮助你在 Linux 发行版中安装 Cool Retro Terminal 应用程序。




你有没有想过如何在你的 Linux 终端中模仿那些老式 CRT 显示器的外观？

那些 CRT 屏幕有自己的粉丝。如果你把苹果 2 或 IBM 3278 终端之类与今天的 4K 显示器显示相比较，它们的外观真的很酷。我并不是说 4K 显示器不好，但有时传统的显示器会让我们想起那些过去的日子。闲话少说。让我们开始安装这个应用程序。

Cool Retro Terminal

该应用程序是自由开源的。它被称为 cool-retro-term。它是轻量级的，有许多自定义选项，有预先设置的配置文件，如 Apple 2 等。它还能在你的终端中提供那些静态噪音和扫描线效果。很酷，不是吗？

它是用 Qt 构建的，需要 Qt 5.2 或更高版本。如果你使用的是最新的 Linux 发行版，在依赖性方面你应该没问题。



如何下载和安装 Cool Retro Terminal

Ubuntu、Linux Mint 和其他基于 Debian 的发行版：

使用下面的简单命令在你的 Ubuntu 和其他相关发行版中安装这个应用程序：

sudo apt install cool-retro-term


Arch Linux：

这个软件包在 Arch 用户仓库（AUR）中可用。如果你没有启用 AUR，请使用 本指南 启用它，然后使用以下命令来安装它：

pacman -S cool-retro-term


Fedora、RHEL 和其他相关发行版：

对于 Fedora 和其他相关的 Linux，使用下面的命令来安装这个应用程序：

sudo dnf install cool-retro-term


Appimage：

也有一个 AppImage 格式的独立的可执行程序，你可以直接下载并运行。不需要安装。按照下面的命令来做：

1901年作家泰戈尔四十岁，他在加尔各答以北约一百英里孟加拉郊区的桑蒂尼盖登创立了一所小小的学校。二十年后，他在那旁边又建立了一所名为维斯瓦·巴拉蒂的大学，其名称是将梵语中的“世界”与“智慧”相结合，其校训是“整个世界在这个小窝中相遇”。这些合作办学机构的教育愿景在当时颇为大胆且有实验性：男女同校，没有体罚，也没有什么正式的纪律，课堂就在户外的树荫下。他们强调美术、音乐、体育和戏剧教育，不看重考试及形式化的成绩。课堂之外，教师和学生们自由社交。最重要的目的是鼓励学生的想象力和思想自由，并向他们灌输对世界（和印度）伟大而多元的知识和文化的欣赏与赞美。因此，其课程范围非常广泛，不仅涉及印度的历史、艺术和文学财富，而且对西方、非洲、拉丁美洲和亚洲其他地区的各种文化也给予同样的关注。
泰戈尔的设想反映了他对传统学校教育的不满，也反映了他现代与开放的背景。他本人从未在学校里待很久，青少年时期去英国旅居，在布莱顿他很快就从为他安排的公学退学了；在伦敦时他只在伦敦大学学院读了几个月；在加尔各答的总统学院他只待了一整天。但他曾接受过梵文、英文、音乐、哲学及其他科目的教育，主要由私人教师和他有才的哥哥姐姐们授课，其中有几位成为了著名的作家、作曲家、爱国者和知识分子。
这种量身定制的多元文化教育之所以能够实现，不仅仅因为泰戈尔是他父母的第十四个孩子，还因为他出生在孟加拉的豪门之一。他的祖先从十七世纪末就成了东印度公司的成功经纪人，家族财富随着东印度公司的壮大而增长。到十九世纪他们堪比加尔各答的美第奇家族。作家泰戈尔的祖父德瓦卡纳特·泰戈尔是当时一位富有的商人、慈善家和社会改革家，他曾在欧洲社交圈大放异彩，维多利亚女王在白金汉宫款待过他，还被誉…]]></summary>

要是你想要（或需要）知道 开源 的意思究竟是什么。我会介绍开源的一些基础，无论你是对项目贡献感兴趣，还是在想要融入的新工作圈子里总是听到这个名词，因为这个词总是被人不断的提起。

我坦白，我这个人没什么技术经验，在极具技术性的开源社区中从事着内容设计的边缘工作。考虑到我原来的背景是营销与传播，我决定换工作时感觉就像离了水的鱼儿。Git、数据科学、软件的来龙去脉……直到一年后的今天，我依然感到难以消化。

但这正是为什么我要写这篇文章。我想要让开源变得不那么令人生畏。毕竟，开源的中心是一个支持型的学习社区 —— 这个社区对所有人开放，无论你是否有技术经验。

我会从基础中的基础开始。

什么是开源？

在此声明，业界对开源的定义可以在 开放源代码促进会Open Source Initiative 的网站找到。

然而，大众对“开源”软件的认知通常为它不用花钱，它的源代码是公开的，任何人都可以对其贡献，你可以重新发布它或者用它做任何你想做的事。

这里面有些是真的，而有些则属于常见的误解，其中之一就是关于花费。

开源只要 0 元

这是真的吗？大部分情况下是，但不是所有情况。开源软件的本质在于代码的公开性，所以获取软件本身确实不需要花费。但是，依赖开源项目营利的公司也确实存在。但如果软件不需要花钱，开源公司又是如何生存的？他们该如何盈利？

拥有“免费产品”这个概念本身是反直觉的。但你要知道：一个公司不一定要靠出售软件来赚钱，它也可以从产品的管理，数据的储存，以及对客户的支持中获利。

很多公司都采用了订阅模式，他们提供客户支持服务以帮助客户解决软件问题并为客户解答疑惑。数据储存也并非免费，这也是能为公司带来收入的另一领域。从这个角度来说，在销售的“产品”不是软件，而是订阅服务。


开源代码是公开…]]></summary>

I lead the technical efforts at one of the charities in Ukraine; we're now trying to rebuild connectivity for people in some of the areas where much of the civilian infrastructure was destroyed and Starlink® is not a viable option, or perhaps "not-to-be easily scaled option."
The world of long-range Wi-Fi is a wild one!
We are now trying to evaluate the cost of a point-to-point mesh network using commodity hardware, and so far have only experimented with Raspberry hardware to work the antenna, and some Atheros AR9331-based SoC's. The idea is to make a single device that can act as both a relay station, as well as an actual hotspot, it then can be placed in line-of-sight configuration to potentially cover huge areas (the accepted performance would be anywhere from 0.1-1 Mbit/s point-to-point over anywhere from 5-20km. We are aiming to bring the cost of such configuration down to $100 per unit at least. Hopefully, we also wouldn't need to do so and somebody else could do the whole thing for us at a similar price... Where would you start, i.e. with the vendors, as well as the commodity hardware, firmware that should work best for a setup like this? Bonus points; if it can be somewhat be aware of the current happenstance. In terms of bleed from Electronic warfare deployed by the enemy in Ukraine; it has to work hopefully in adversarial environment!
Best regards,
Ilya

许多被开除的人是谷歌开源项目办公室（OSPO）和其他开源工作中最优秀的人。这包括 18 年前创建谷歌 OSPO 的 Chris DiBona；还有 Samba 的共同创造者，前谷歌开发者生态系统的项目经理，以及新招聘的负责谷歌开源安全计划的人等等。


消息来源：The Register



老王点评：这时候我们要问一句，“谷歌还爱开源”吗？并不是开源的人不能裁，对谷歌来说，这些开源专家并没有他们自己想象中的那么重要。他们只是裁人算法下的牺牲品。




沃顿商学院的副教授要求学生使用 ChatGPT

出于对利用 ChatGPT 作弊的担忧，一些学区已经禁止使用它，但沃顿商学院的副教授 Ethan Mollick 不仅允许学生使用 ChatGPT，而且将其列为要求，并将 AI 政策纳入教学大纲。他说，“我们是在一个有计算器的世界教学生数学。现在的挑战是教育者要教学生世界如何再次改变，以及他们如何适应这种改变。”他指出，使用人工智能是一项 “新兴技能”；它可能是错误的，学生应该根据其他来源检查其结果；他们将对该工具提供的任何错误或遗漏负责。


消息来源：NPR



老王点评：积极正面的去迎接新技术的到来，而不是螳臂当车。




GitHub 质疑对 Copilot 滥用开源代码的指控

GitHub、微软和 OpenAI 在周四给法庭的文件中说，由一群匿名版权所有者提出的投诉没有足够具体地概述他们的指控。他们认为，原告缺乏提起诉讼的资格，因为他们未能证明他们因该公司的行为而受到具体伤害。并称，诉讼中没有指明他们滥用的特定版权作品或他们违反的合同。文件中还称，这些版权指控将 “一头撞上合理使用原则”，该原则允许在某些情况下未经许可使用版权作品。


消息来源：路透社



老王点评：首先，GitHub 恐怕否认不了 Copilot 是从 GitHub 上存储的代码进行学习的，甚至是直接原样复制了代码。而是否是“合理使用”，可能不仅仅要看判例，还要看这些代码使用的许可证。]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[GNOME 的调查数据揭示了一些令人感兴趣的用户偏好。这是否会影响 GNOME 在不久的将来的开发决策？让我们拭目以待。




在 2022 年 8 月，GNOME 开发了 一个工具，让用户可以匿名提供关于他们的系统配置、扩展和 GNOME 调整的设置。

这是为了帮助 GNOME 深入了解用户的偏好，并在分析数据的基础上做出更好的决定。

GNOME 设计团队的成员 Allan Day 在最近的一篇博文中分享了收集的数据。它包含了一些有趣的洞察和发现。

让我带你了解一下：

研究报告的发现

本研究报告包括来自 2,517 个用户的数据，这些用户的硬件和软件配置各不相同。


📋 这些数据是使用 gnome-info-collect 工具 从向 GNOME 提供数据的人那里获得的，并不代表 GNOME 的全部用户。


最初，他们收到了 2,560 个回复，但由于一些数据没有来自使用 GNOME 的系统或来自虚拟机，他们不得不从数据集中删除一些。

它包含什么？它含有匿名的非敏感数据指标，显示了用户是如何设置他们的系统的。


💡 这对 GNOME 团队来说可以有很大的用处，他们现在可以使用这些数据来做出设计和开发的决定。


其中一个引起我们注意的数据指标是在他们的 GNOME 系统上使用 Flatpak 的人的百分比。

超过 90% 的系统都安装了 Flatpak。

在 2517 个用户中，有高达 2344 个用户在他们的 GNOME 系统上安装了 Flatpak。其中 2,102 人完全启用了它。

在这样一个小的数据集中，这是一个巨大的数字！ 🤯

关于这一点，Allan 有这样的补充说明：


Flatpak 和 Flathub 对 GNOME 的战略方向至关重要，所以了解它们的采用程度是很有用的。这种采用程度也与 GNOME 的软件应用设计有关。


除此之外，一些关键的收获包括：


最常用的默认网页浏览器是 Mozilla Firefox。

在使用 GNOME 的人中，最常用的发行版是 Fedora。

谷歌是配置了在线账户的用户的首选账户。

GIMP 是安装在 GNOME 上最受欢迎的应用程序之一，紧随其后的是 VLC。

83% 的用户至少启用了一个 GNOME 扩展。


我建议你通过该 研究报告 来获得更深入的了解。

这是否有助于改善 GNOME 的体验？

收集这些数据是为了通过分析和提供给设计和开发团队来改善桌面体验。

然而，收集到的数据仍然相当有限，可能无法代表大多数的 GNOME 用户。

为了解决这个问题，博文中提到：


总的来说，这些数据对于 GNOME 项目应该专注于哪些功能给出了一些有力的提示。它也提供了关于哪些功能不应该被优先考虑的证据。需要记住的是，虽然我们在这里有关于一些 GNOME 用户做出的决定的证据，但这些数据并没有让我们深入了解为什么他们会做出这样的决定。


GNOME 团队希望在根据这些数据做出决定时保持谨慎。而且，像这样的调查应该能让他们更好地了解用户的偏好，并把重点放在基本层面上更重要的东西上。

当然，不可能照顾到每一种类型的用户。但是，只要基本面得到了照顾，桌面体验最终应该得到改善。

你对这些发现有什么看法？欢迎在下面的评论中分享你的想法。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[只要你遵循这些通用流程，代码评审并不可怕。


你是否需要在你还没有完全理解整个项目时就对代码进行评审？抑或你避开了评审，以免让你看起来不知道如何进行。

本篇文章想要告诉你一个更好的方法。代码评审code review 并不需要你知道所有事情。实际上，就我个人经验而言，这种情况非常普遍。

我还记得作为实习生加入 红帽Red Hat 的时候，被要求参与代码评审。我们当时采取的是 +1 或 -1 的投票系统，而我在一开始的时候常常踌躇于该如何评审。我发现我会问自己，如果我对于一处改动给予了 +1，而别人却投了 -1，我是不是看起来很蠢？

如果你对一处改动投了 +1，而别人投了 -1，这又意味着什么呢？答案是不意味任何事！你可能只是漏掉了一处别人注意到的细节。这不意味着世界末日。这也是为什么我们会用投票系统。正如同所有开源项目一样，代码合并是一项协同工作。

最近，我接到了太多的代码评审工作，以至于我几乎做不过来。我同时也注意到，参与评审的贡献者数量正在稳步减少。

出于这个原因，我想要写一篇文章阐述我对代码评审的个人观点。在这篇文章里，我会分享一些诀窍与技巧。我将会向你展示几个用来问自己的问题，以及在评审代码时需要注意的一些地方。

代码评审的目的是什么？

你是否曾写过一个非常简单的补丁？你认为它是如此微不足道，不需要审查。或许你直接就合并了它。直到晚些时候，你意识到你犯了个错误，一个明显的或是愚蠢的错误，比如错误的缩进，比如几行重复的代码而不是调用函数（是的，这些都是经验之谈！）。

如果有其他人来审查代码，就会发现这些东西。

代码评审的一个目的便是为你带来一双新的眼睛，从新的视角看待你要尝试解决的问题。这种新的背景也正是为什么代码评审至关重要。

你可能认为你必须是一个语言专家，才能审查别人的代码、项目，或两者。让我来告诉你一个所有代码评审…]]></summary>

 Cim stands for Common input method.
 Input methods in Linux and BSD are fragmented.
 There are many input methods in Linux and BSD, such as XIM, Gtk-IM, Qt-IM, and Wayland-IM.
 Cim is software that integrates these input methods.
 Already, the Gtk input method and the Qt input method are plugin methods, and it has already been proven that there is no problem for decades when these plugin methods are used for input.
 However, since the Gtk input method and Qt input method depend on Gtk and Qt, respectively, X-only, Java, Wayland-only, and console-only applications cannot use such Gtk and Qt input methods.
 So I designed a common input method with C API by removing the dependency on Gtk from the Gtk input method.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[当地时间周一，据外媒报道，苹果公司的主要供应商、美国科技巨头捷普公司（Jabil Inc.）已开始在印度为AirPods生产零部件，这标志着苹果在推动供应链多元化方面又迈出了重要一步。


据传Airpods零部件开始在印生产


知情人士对媒体透露，捷普公司的印度子公司已经开始生产AirPods外壳（塑料机身），并运往中国和越南用于组装。


迄今为止，苹果在印度生产的产品仅限于iPhone。假如消息属实，这意味着AirPods将成为第二款部分在印度生产的苹果产品。


据捷普公司官网介绍，该公司在印度西部的浦那运营着一家占地85.8万平方英尺（约合8万平方米）的工厂，雇佣了2500多名工人。


研究公司Canalys的数据显示，苹果第三季度无线耳机出货量为2380万部，市场份额为31%。


这对于印度政府来说也是一条喜讯。近年来，印度总理莫迪已将发展印度制造业列为国家优先事项，并一直积极为企业的扩张项目提供财政激励和政府支持。


印度政府正积极提供支持


尽管目前距离苹果在印度完整生产AirPods还有一段时间，但印度政府已初步批准苹果的十多家中国供应商通过与印度合作伙伴组建合资企业来扩大生产 ——这为Airpods等更多苹果产品在印生产拓宽了道路。


苹果公司的中国供应商之一、生产AirPods的立讯精密就是据称获得批准的公司之一。立讯精密于2020年同意收购摩托罗拉在印度南部泰米尔纳德邦的一家工厂，但尚未开始在当地生产苹果产品。


一位知情人士表示，印度莫迪政府正在制定计划，为无线耳机和智能手表的本地生产提供财政激励。


调研机构Counterpoint研究副总裁尼尔·沙阿（Neil Shah）表示：“制造外壳通常是全面生产AirPods的第一步……现在包括立讯在内的一些苹果供应商已经获得了初步批准，他们显然正在为生产最终产品建立供应链。”


尽管苹果绝大部分iPhone产品供应链仍在国内，但苹果公司已经在供应链多元化方面取得了一定进展。


去年，苹果的合作伙伴鸿海精密在iPhone 14全球发售几周后就开始在印度生产。从去年4月到12月，苹果从印度出口了超过25亿美元的苹果产品。

奔驰成为美国首家获得三级自动驾驶认证的汽车公司

周四，奔驰确认其 Drive Pilot 自动驾驶辅助系统（ADAS）现在符合内华达州第 482A 章的要求，成为目前美国唯一合法的三级自动驾驶系统。第三级能力将使车辆在参与时能够处理 “所有方面的驾驶”，这比我们今天看到的二级系统，如特斯拉的 “完全自动驾驶”、福特的 “蓝色巡航” 和通用的 “超级巡航”，有了很大的进步。奔驰称，其 ADAS 可以“在 40 英里/小时的速度范围内接管保险杠对保险杠的爬行任务，而驾驶员不需要将手放在方向盘上。” 甚至可以对 “意外的交通情况作出反应并独立处理，例如，在车道内进行规避动作或进行制动动作。”

《科学》期刊禁止将 ChatGPT 列为论文的共同作者

《科学》期刊宣布了一项更新的编辑政策，禁止使用 ChatGPT 生成的文本，并澄清该程序不能被列为作者。《科学》期刊要求作者签署一份表格，声明他们对自己对工作的贡献负责任，而由于 ChatGPT 不能这样做，所以它不能成为作者。此外，他们认为，即使在准备论文时使用 ChatGPT 也有问题。因为 ChatGPT 会犯很多错误，这些错误可能会出现在文献中，如果科学家们开始依赖人工智能程序来准备文献综述或总结他们的发现，那么工作的正确背景和结果应有的深入审查就可能会丢失。


消息来源：《卫报》



老王点评：有一定的道理，但是我认为是徒劳的，就像你不可能阻止使用计算器一样。计算器本身并不能替你完成全部求解，只是一个辅助工具。经过 AI 辅助的研究论文终究会找到它应有的位置。]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[据史书记载，班固撰写《汉书》时，有两部分内容没有写完，即八《表》与《天文志》，他死后由班昭等人接续完成。由此想到，此处称八《表》与《天文志》未完成，是因为在班固的《汉书》书稿中，它们有篇章目录而无内容，所以有后人补写完成。但是我在研读《汉书》时发现，这种“有目录无内容”的现象，不但是在“章”的目录中出现，在下一层目录即“节”中，也有类似的情况存在。比如在《汉书·五行志》的章目之下，班固总共列出六十九个问题的目录，或称例目，但在下面的正文中，班固只写出四十二个问题，可以称为“实目”；还有二十七个例目没有给出内容，也可以称为“空目”。此类情况的产生，原因何在呢？它们是否与班固的八《表》与《天文志》一样没写完，还是班固有意而为之？它们是否没有被后人发现，因此也未续写；还是后人发现了，但无力续写或不屑续写？
说明此事之前，先做一个相关知识背景的铺垫，然后再列出班固《汉书·五行志》已写的与未写的目录，最后简述一下《汉书·五行志》未完善的三件事情。

《汉书》书影

《汉书》的两个来源
班固撰写《汉书·五行志》，他的思路大体有两个来源：一是在总体上，《汉书》对《史记》的续写；再一是在个体上，班固以《洪范五行传》为纲目，创建《汉书·五行志》的体例。此中《洪范五行传》已失传，撰著者众说不一，有说是伏生所作，有说是夏侯始昌所作，也有说是刘向刘歆父子所作（《书经·洪范注》《汉书·眭两夏侯京翼李传》《廿二史剳记·汉儒言灾异》）。本文按下此事不表。现将前述两个来源问题分论如下：
一、从《史记》说起
先说司马迁撰著《史记》，只写到汉武帝时期，太初年之后缺而不录。汉代学者刘向、刘歆、冯商、卫衡、扬雄、史岑、梁审、肆仁、晋冯、段肃、金丹、冯衍、韦融、萧奋、刘询等都曾经缀集时事，续补《史记》。班固的父亲班彪认为，这些著作水平不高，不足以踵继前史。于是班彪采集旧事，旁贯异文，作《史记后传》百余篇，或称数十篇…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[zram 是一个用于创建内存压缩缓存的工具，特别是可以用作交换空间。


我在我的电脑上花了很多时间（我是说工作），我发现了很多有趣的东西。其中最近引起我注意的是 zram0 设备。我是在几个月前写一篇文章时第一次注意到它，它显示在 lsblk 命令的输出中：

# lsblk
NAME          MAJ:MIN RM   SIZE RO TYPE MOUNTPOINTS
sda             8:0    0 931.5G  0 disk
├─sda1          8:1    0   600M  0 part
[...]
zram0         252:0    0     8G  0 disk [SWAP]


它被识别为交换空间，这就是首先引起我的好奇心的原因，所以我做了一些研究。zram 最初被称为 “压缩缓存compcache”，即 “压缩的高速缓存”。事实证明，zram 是一个用于创建内存内压缩缓存的工具，特别是作为交换空间使用。

但为什么呢？

当我开始研究 zram 时，我只发现了几篇关于将 zram 用于交换空间的基础文章。起初，这对我来说似乎有点违反直觉。毕竟，如果你的内存快用完了，你把页面交换到内存中的虚拟驱动器中，有什么好处呢？

然后我找到了 Fedora 项目的维基页面，它提议使用 zram 交换空间swap-on-zram。该建议说：“交换是有用的，除了它的速度很慢。zram 是一个使用了压缩的内存驱动器。在启动时创建一个 zram 交换空间，并且不再使用默认的交换分区。”

该页面的其余部分是关于它的细节、好处、副作用和反馈。

Linux 上用于交换空间的 zram

使用 zram 作为交换空间，与常规的基于分区或基于文件的交换空间做的事情相同。当内存压力过大时，一些最近使用…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[昔日科技巨擘比尔·盖茨有了新身份——美国最大私有农田 “地主”。根据2022年版《土地报告100》（The Land Report 100）的数据，比尔·盖茨已经在美国拥有超27万英亩农田，这相当于1090平方千米多土地，接近北京通州区的面积。


此前，比尔·盖茨1月中旬参加了社交新闻网站Reddit的“问我任何问题”（Ask Me Anything）活动，在被问到拥有大量农田的原因时，回应称：“我拥有的农田不到美国的1/4000。我的投资是为了提高它们的生产力，创造更多的就业机会。这其中没有什么宏伟的商业计划。事实上，所有这些都是专业投资团队做出的决定。”


据农业创投媒体AgFunder的报道，在过去十多年里，比尔·盖茨持续透过旗下投资公司Cascade Investment收购全美各地的农地，并在比美国19个州拥有农业土地。





比尔及梅琳达·盖茨在美国拥有的土地，图片：Farmfolio，发布于2022年4月


根据该网站的分析，购买耕地可以收获两种强劲并现实的回报：租金和农作物，以及土地升值后的出售收益。AgFunder数据显示，自1992年至2020年期间，美国农田的平均年回报率为10.9%，而股市为7.87%，黄金为6%。此外，农田也是一种波动性极低的资产类别，在上述周期中耕地的波动率为6.84%，股市的波动率为16.9%，黄金的波动率为14.8%。


同时，农田与包括股票、债券和黄金在内的其他主要资产类别不相关，这意味着它不易受其他资产价格的影响。这样帮助投资者实现资产配置的多元化。


尽管在美国有关于比尔·盖茨大量囤田的各种传言，但抛开捕风捉影的猜测，购买农田本身则是一项较为稳健的投资行为。


比尔·盖茨今年一直致力于农业慈善的捐助，他曾回应称“有了高生产力的种子，我们可以避免砍伐更多森林，并协助非洲应对气候困境”。


根据比尔·盖茨的说法，在他农地上进行的研究与实验，很大一部分是为了提高生产力，凭借粮食增产收获更多利润。同时他也不讳言地表示，“有一些农地靠近大城市，未来可能会有其他用途”。


但比起购买农田的原因，令很多美国人更为担忧的，是富豪大量囤地的后果。


目前，美国的农场主要由中小型家庭农场组成。一些美国农民担心，有钱人购买农业土地可能会增加他们对土地的垄断，这也会抬高农田价格。最终威胁到小农户的经营。


面对人们的顾虑，比尔·盖茨在Reddit还表示“我将卖掉我拥有的一切，把钱捐给基金会。在此期间，我的投资团队试图投资包括农田在内的生产性资产，尽管这不到总资产的4%。”


不过，比尔·盖茨并不是个例，不少有钱人都对农业表示出兴趣。在《土地报告100》中，杰夫·贝索斯拥有42万英亩土地，其中包括大量耕地、森林和未开垦的土地。

欧盟拟议的《网络弹性法案（CRA）》被称之为软件产品的 “CE 标志”。它有四个具体目标，其中之一要求制造商在 “整个生命周期” 内提高数字产品的安全性。对于软件开发商和硬件制造商来说，这将增加新的网络安全要求、合格评估、文件和报告义务的直接合规成本。这个成本预计将达到 290 亿欧元，但预计可以减少安全事件带来的成本为 1800 至 2900 亿欧元。问题是，自由软件开发者如何能够承担合规成本？这可能打破了开源生态系统的社会契约：免费提供用于任何目的的开源软件，可以自由修改和进一步分发，但作者、贡献者或开源分销商没有保证或责任。

老王点评：我觉得，开源软件的基石不容触动，CRA 尽可以去约束那些商业的专有软件。




美国联邦调查局黑掉了勒索团伙

美国联邦调查局的政府黑客闯入了勒索团伙 Hive 的网络，并对该团伙进行了监视，窃取了该团伙用来解锁数据的数字密钥。然后他们提前提醒受害者，以便他们能够在 Hive 要求付款之前保护他们的系统。美国司法部表示，多年来，Hive 入侵了 80 个不同国家的 1500 多名受害者，勒索金额超过了 1 亿美元。周四，Hive 的网站被查封，并在该网站显示了查封信息。政府黑客对 Hive 的监视从 2022 年 7 月开始直到被查封前，都没有被 Hive 发现。


消息来源：路透社



老王点评：政府黑客技高一筹啊，看来是懒得和勒索黑帮玩下去了。




2022 年 FreeBSD 没有达到筹款目标

FreeBSD 发布了其 2022 年第四季度的状态报告。根据报告，他们 2022 年的筹款目标是 140 万美元，而截至现在大约是 114.7 万美元。他们正在考虑引进一个能够鼓励组织投资于 FreeBSD 的人。报告中其中值得关注的信息还有：发布工程团队正在努力推出 FreeBSD 13.2；正在开发集成应用容器 Vessel，以类似 Docker 的界面向应用开发者展示许多 FreeBSD 的特性。


消息来源：Phoronix



老王点评：FreeBSD 的日子比起来 Linux 惨淡得多，但是 FreeBSD 依旧带来了很多技术进步。

The Politics of Pleasure: A Portrait of Benjamin Disraeli, Simon & Schuster UK，2007

1868年，迪斯雷利接替病重的德比勋爵，受命组阁。维多利亚女王在写给长女（普鲁士王储妃）的家信中难掩激动和喜悦之情：“迪斯雷利先生成为新首相！这对于一个在人民中崛起的人来说，多么值得骄傲！”
此时距阿尔伯特亲王病逝已有七年。女王夫妇是表亲，婚后二人恩爱逾常，共诞育九名子女。亲王心思缜密，讷言敏行，不仅是女王事业的帮手，更是她感情的寄托。亲王逝后，女王哀恸过度，长期陷入自闭和幽居状态：她谢绝朝臣觐见，也无心过问政事。少数共和派乘机发难，叫嚣取消君主制。对此，朝野上下有识之士无不忧心忡忡。
女王当时的处境可谓内外交困。长子威尔士亲王爱德华继承乔治家族不良基因，轻佻放荡，先后卷入莫当特（Mordaunt）丑闻与埃尔斯福德（Aylesford）事件，后竟以通奸罪被告上法庭，令王室颜面扫地。与宫内丑闻相比，余波未了的宪章运动更触动王权根本。有一份地下传播的小册子，公开妄议女王的财务状况：根据法律条款，国家每年为王室支付费用总计三十八万五千英镑，其中女王私人费用即高达六万英镑——作者大胆发问：对于一位只需履行象征性职责的君主而言，国库这一笔支出是否必要？日后女王回忆说，这一段是她一生中最孤立无援的时期：她成了“一名惨遭公众误会的女人”——大臣、报纸和民众拧成一股绳，对她横加指责，但却无人对她表示同情。
迪斯雷利的登场适逢其时。凭借高超的政治智慧和一流情商，他以积极乐观的精神感染女王，重新唤起她对生活的热爱，并将爱心推及她的臣民。日后为人称道的维多利亚时代，以婚姻幸福、家庭和睦、道德完善和社会进步为标志，很大程度上是君臣合力谋划的结果——迪斯雷利认为，让每一位英国人感到开心快乐是政治的最高目的…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[我们都知道如何从键盘输入文字，不是吗？

那么，请允许我挑战你在你最爱的文本编辑器中输入这段文字：



这段文字难以被输入因为它包含着：


键盘上没有的印刷符号，

平假名日文字符，

为符合平文式罗马字标准，日本首都的名字中的两个字母 “o” 头顶带有长音符号，

以及最后，用西里尔字母拼写的名字德米特里。


毫无疑问，想要在早期的电脑中输入这样的句子是不可能的。这是因为早期电脑所使用的字符集有限，无法兼容多种书写系统。而如今类似的限制已不复存在，马上我们就能在文中看到。

电脑是如何储存文字的？

计算机将字符作为数字储存。它们再通过表格将这些数字与含有意义的字形一一对应。

在很长一段时间里，计算机将每个字符作为 0 到 255 之间的数字储存（这正好是一个字节的长度）。但这用来代表人类书写所用到的全部字符是远远不够的。而解决这个问题的诀窍在于，取决于你住在地球上的哪一块区域，系统会分别使用不同的对照表。

这里有一张在法国常被广泛使用的对照表 ISO 8859-15：



如果你住在俄罗斯，你的电脑大概会使用 KOI8-R 或是 Windows-1251 来进行编码。现在让我们假设我们在使用后者：



对于 128 之前的数字，两张表格是一样的。这个范围与 US-ASCII 相对应，这是不同字符表格之间的最低兼容性。而对于 128 之后的数字，这两张表格则完全不同了。

比如，依据 Windows-1251，字符串 “said Дмитрий” 会被储存为：

115 97 105 100 32 196 236 232 242 240 232 233


按照计算机科学的常规方法，这十二个数字可被写成更加紧凑的十六进制：

The kernel thread executes the “rfcomm_run()” function (https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/latest/source/net/bluetooth/rfcomm/core.c#L2109). Thus, we can say that “krfcommd” is responsible for RFCOMM connections (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57152408/what-is-the-internal-mechanics-of-socket-function).
 RFCOMM (Radio Frequency Communication) is a set of transport protocols on top of L2CAP which provides emulated RS-232 serial ports. It provides a simple reliable data stream (like TCP). It is used directly by many telephony related profiles as a carrier for AT commands, as well as being a transport layer for OBEX over Bluetooth…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey HN! Some more info: I’m an NHS doctor and the founder of Pi-A (https://www.pi-a.io) which developed Lungy (https://www.lungy.app). Lungy is an app (iOS only for now) that responds to breathing in real-time and was designed to make breathing exercises more engaging and beneficial to do. It hopefully has many aspects of interest to the HN community – real-time fluid, cloth and soft body sims running on the phone’s GPU.
My background is as a junior surgical trainee and I started building Lungy in 2020 during the first COVID lockdown in London. During COVID, there were huge numbers of patients coming off ventilators and they are often given breathing exercises on a worksheet and disposable plastic devices called incentive spirometers to encourage deep breathing. This is intended to prevent chest infections and strengthen breathing muscles that have weakened. I noticed often the incentive spirometer would sit by the bedside, whilst the patient would be on their phone – this was the spark that lead to Lungy!
The visuals are mostly built using Metal, with one or two using SpriteKit. There are 20 to choose from, including boids, cloth sims, fluid sims, a hacky DLA implementation, rigid body + soft body sims. The audio uses AudioKit with a polyphonic synth and a sequencer plays generated notes from a chosen scale (you can mess around with the sequencer and synth in Settings/Create Music).
There are obviously lots of breathing and meditation apps out there, I wanted Lungy to be different - it's about tuning into your surroundings and noticing the world around you, so all the visuals are nature-inspired or have some reference to the physical world. I didn’t like other apps required large downloads and/or a wifi connection, so Lungy’s download size is very small (https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34534615

and data structures; this naturally leads to concerns about maintaining
interface stability as the kernel changes.  The longstanding position that
BPF offers no interface-stability guarantees to user space has always
seemed a little questionable; kernel developers have, in the past, found
themselves having to maintain interfaces that were not intended to be
stable.  Now the BPF community is starting to think about what it might
mean to provide explicit stability promises for at least some of its
interfaces.]]></summary>

a couple of Rust crates in an attempt to determine whether they
actually implement the read-copy-update algorithm; in the process, he gives
an overview of the numerous RCU variants in the kernel.



	Except that the first RCU crate, rcu_clean, throws a monkey wrench
	into the works.  It does not have any grace-period primitives, but
	instead a clean() function that takes a reference to a
	RCU-protected data item.  The user invokes this at some point in
	the code where it is known that there are no readers, either within
	this thread or anywhere else.  In true Rust fashion, in some cases,
	the compiler is able to prove the presence or absence of readers
	and issue a diagnostic when needed.]]></summary>

谁是阿瓜卢萨？稍为了解当代非洲葡萄牙语文学的读者对他肯定不陌生，但是对我来说却是第一次读他的作品。若泽·爱德华多·阿瓜卢萨（José Eduardo Agualusa）是当代安哥拉乃至整个葡语世界的代表作家，也是近年来竞逐诺贝尔文学奖的热门人选，各种文学大奖都青睐他。只是这个中译人名有点怪怪的，似乎很难想象“阿瓜”会出现在欧美作家的译名中。叫他“阿古鲁萨”如何？
若泽·爱德华多·阿瓜卢萨的《生者与余众》（原葡语书名 Os Vivos e os Outros ，2020；王渊译，上海人民出版社，2022年4月）是他近年的新作，出版之日正是疫情与战争把世界拖入危机与困境之时。小说中的孤岛隔离、信息中断、核弹危机等情境似乎正是时代危机与困境的预言。原书名“Os Vivos e os Outros”直译就是“活着的人和其他人”，不是“生者与死者”，或许可以理解为生存困境中的人的复杂面向，比如人与其他的存在，并非仅是人的生与死那么简单 。
小说描写发生在七天中的事情。安哥拉作家丹尼尔·本希莫尔等非洲各国的数十位作家、诗人来到莫桑比克岛参加第一届莫桑比克岛文学节，这个小岛仅以大桥与非洲大陆连接。第一天，有人发现手机没有信号了，网也上不去了。小岛与外界的联系方式突然全部中断，失去了网络、电力，暴风雨使船无法出海，大桥也无法通行。“这就是一切的开始：巨大的闪光中夜晚被撕裂，而小岛与世界分离。一段纪元慢慢终结，另一段渐渐开始。但彼时无人知晓。”（22页）作家们既来之则安之，在酒店、在海边聊天、举杯、回答记者问题。到了第五天，手机突然有了短暂的信号，人们读到来自五天前的信息，才知道“一颗原子弹在以色列爆炸了！”（213页）耶路撒冷遭到了核弹袭击，全球随之爆发骚乱，孤岛危机的困…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[《英雄联盟》源代码被窃，勒索 1000 万美元

开发《英雄联盟》的拳头游戏被入侵，入侵者说，“我们已经获得了你的宝贵数据，包括珍贵的反作弊源代码和整个《英雄联盟》的游戏代码及其工具，以及你的用户模式反作弊器 Packman。……要求交换 10,000,000 美元。”并只给了 12 个小时的期限。入侵者警告称，他们只花费了几个小时的业余水平的入侵。拳头游戏承认了被入侵，但表示不会支付赎金，没有提供更多信息。


消息来源：VICE



老王点评：1000 万美元对日进斗金的《英雄联盟》倒是不贵，问题是，支付了赎金怕是也没用。




自由软件基金会收紧对许可证的审批

自由软件基金会（FSF）董事会通过了下个月实施的更新章程，旨在进一步保护左版许可。更新后的附则收紧了起草和发布新的/更新的许可证的审批程序：现在需要绝对多数（66%）的赞成票。此规定适用于所有 FSF 许可证，包括任何 GNU 版权许可证。


消息来源：自由软件基金会



老王点评：看起来 FSF 在治理方面进一步完善了。




Wine 8.0 发布，完成 PE 转换

作为年度稳定版本，Wine 8.0 纳入了过去一年中的所有变化。在此版本中，完成了将所有 Wine 模块转换为 PE 格式的工作。这对于复制保护、64 位主机上的 32 位应用支持、Windows 调试器、Arm 上的 x86 应用等工作非常重要。此外，在 Wine 8.0 中还有如下变化：打印处理器架构已经实现；继续进行 WoW64 的开发；控制器的热插拔支持得到了极大的改善等等。


消息来源：Wine HQ



老王点评：虽然有越来越多的原生 Linux 应用和游戏，现在 Wine 并不如早期那么重要，但是 Wine 依然是 Linux 的重要基石之一。]]></summary>

I’m Joe, CTO at Dopt. We’re building a tool that lets you design user state machines with an SDK so that you can run them in your product.
We offer a React SDK that lets you create instances of those machines for any user of your product and exposes methods for transitioning the state of the user—effectively moving them through the machine. Dopt then acts as a persistence layer for the users’ machine state. We call our machines “flows”. Dopt lets you send in data about your users (identify calls/properties) and lets non-devs define rules based on that data for which users should enter the flows. Non-devs can also update content and other custom properties that can be referenced via the SDK.
For example, with Dopt’s SDK you can build:

little-endian has 
largely "won" the battle at this point since the vast majority of today's
systems store data with the least-significant byte first (at the lowest
address).  But when the X11 protocol was developed in the 1980s, there were 
lots of systems of each byte order, so the X protocol allowed either order
and the server (display side) would swap the bytes to its byte order as
needed.  Over time, 
the code for swapping data in the messages, which was written in a
more-trusting era, has bit-rotted so that it is now a
largely untested attack surface that is nearly always unused.  Peter
Hutterer has been doing some work to stop using that code by default, both
in upstream 
X.org code and in downstream Fedora.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Kostya Shishkov has just posted the
concluding installment of an extensive history of the FFmpeg project:


	See, unlike many people I don’t regard FFmpeg as something unique
	(in the sense that it’s a project only Fabrice Bellard could
	create). It was nice to have around and it helped immeasurably but
	without it something else would fill the niche. There were other
	people working on similar tasks after all (does anybody remember
	transcode? or gmerlin?). Hopefully you got an idea on how many
	talented unsung heroes had been working on FFmpeg and libav over
	the years.


The full set can be found on this
page.  (Thanks to Paul Wise).]]></summary>

收集到的随时间变化的数据称为时间序列数据。今天，它已经成为每个行业和生态系统的一部分。它是不断增长的物联网行业的一大组成部分，将成为人们日常生活的重要部分。但时间序列数据及其需求很难处理。这是因为没有专门为处理时间序列数据而构建的工具。在这篇文章中，我将详细介绍这些问题，以及过去 10 年来 InfluxData 如何解决这些问题。

InfluxData

InfluxData 是一个开源的时间序列数据库平台。你可能通过 InfluxDB 了解该公司，但你可能不知道它专门从事时间序列数据库开发。这很重要，因为在管理时间序列数据时，你要处理两个问题：存储生命周期和查询。

在存储生命周期中，开发人员通常首先收集和分析非常详细的数据。但开发人员希望存储较小的、降低采样率的数据集，以描述其趋势，而不占用太多的存储空间。

查询数据库时，你不希望基于 ID 查询数据，而是希望基于时间范围进行查询。使用时间序列数据最常见的一件事是在一段时间内对其进行汇总。在典型的关系型数据库中存储数据时，这种查询是很慢的，这种数据库使用行和列来描述不同数据点的关系。专门为处理时间序列数据而设计的数据库可以更快地处理这类查询。InfluxDB 有自己的内置查询语言：Flux，这是专门为查询时间序列数据集而构建的。



数据采集

数据采集和数据处理都有一些很棒的工具。InfluxData 有 12 个以上的客户端库，允许你使用自己选择的编程语言编写和查询数据。这是自定义用法的一个很好的工具。开源摄取代理 Telegraf 包括 300 多个输入和输出插件。如果你是一个开发者，你也可以贡献自己的插件。

InfluxDB 还可以接受上传小体积历史数据集的 CSV 文件，以及大数据集…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[这个简单的指南演示了如何在 Windows 上下载和安装 Python。


这篇文章是用最新的 Python 3.11 稳定版测试的。

在学习如何在 Windows 上安装 Python 之前，你可能想看看如何在 Linux 发行版（如 Ubuntu）上轻松安装 ython。如果你打算成为一名开发者，最好在 Linux 中尝试 Python。那么，你可能想看看 如何在 Windows 之外安装 Linux（如 Ubuntu）。

Python 是一种流行的通用编程语言，在过去十年中成为开发者的选择。而且它的受欢迎程度与日俱增。它被广泛用于网络开发、复杂系统、数据科学、机器学习和所有科学领域。

你可能遇到的 Python 有两个版本。Python2 目前已经不支持了。而 Python3 系列是持续支持的版本。

检查 Python 是否已经安装

在 Windows 上安装它之前，你应该检查它是否已经安装。一般来说，它应该没有安装，不像在 Ubuntu （和其他 Linux 发行版）中，Python 是预先安装的。

从开始菜单中，打开“命令提示符”。

并输入以下内容：

python --version


如果 Python 是可用的，它将显示一个包含版本细节的信息。

下载并安装 Python

打开下面的 Python 官方下载页面。


下载 Python




在顶部，你应该看到当前的稳定版本。点击下载链接。如果你正在寻找任何特定的版本，在这个页面上向下滚动，在 &ldquoython releases by version number:” 的标签下下载特定的版本。

下载后，进入下载文件夹，运行安装程序。

按照屏幕上的指示进行安装。





安装完成后，验证 Python 的版本。

验证 Python 版本

从开始菜单，打开“命令提示符”，运行以下命令。

python --version




你应该看到你的系统当前安装的 Python 包的版本。另外，你也可以运行下面的程序来获得一个 Python 交互式 shell。

python


你可以用 CTRL+Z 和回车键退出这个交互界面。

检查 PATH 变量

你应该检查系统变量 PATH，看看 Python 的可执行位置是否存在。这应该是使用安装程序自动更新的。

从开始菜单中，搜索“系统变量system variables”并打开它。



在“系统属性”对话框中，点击“高级Advanced > 环境变量Environment Variables”。在用户变量部分，对照路径变量，检查 Python 的安装位置是否存在。请参考下面的图片作为指导。

如果你看到所有的路径都存在，你就可以运行你的 Python 项目了。



创建并运行你的第一个 Python 程序

一个额外的步骤，这里是你如何编码和运行你的第一个 Python 程序。你可以使用任意 推荐的 Python 编辑器 来编写你的程序。

下面是一个简单的程序，它在控制台中输出文本 debugpoint.com。

# Sample Python program
print("debugpoint.com")


用任意名字保存文件。这里我把它保存为 hello.py，放在 E 盘。.py 是 Python 源码的扩展名。

要运行这个程序，请打开命令提示符，在 E 盘中执行以下内容。

python hello.py


输出：



结束语

我希望这个简单的初学者指南能够帮助你在 Windows 中安装 Python，验证安装并运行你的第一个程序。

如果你遇到问题，请在下面的评论栏中告诉我。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[《猫哲学：猫与生命意义》，[英]约翰·葛雷著，陈信宏译，春山出版有限公司2022年5月出版

英国哲学家罗素《幸福之路》（The Conquest of Happiness）第一章的标题直指人心：“什么使人不幸福？”此章开篇首句如此写道：“动物只要没生病，吃得饱，就是快乐的。我们以为人也应该是这样的，但是当今世界的大多数情况却不是这样。如果你感觉自己不幸福，恐怕你不会认为自己是特殊的。如果你感觉自己是幸福的，那就看看周围有多少朋友跟你一样。”
为动物幸福代言的罗素，不知道有没有读过《庄子·外篇·秋水》里庄子与惠子的辩论：
庄子与惠子游于濠梁之上。庄子曰：“儵鱼出游从容，是鱼乐也。”惠子曰：“子非鱼，安知鱼之乐？”庄子曰：“子非我，安知我不知鱼之乐？”惠子曰：“我非子，固不知子矣; 子固非鱼也，子之不知鱼之乐全矣。”庄子曰：“请循其本。子曰‘汝安知鱼乐’云者，既已知吾知之而问我，我知之濠上也。”
子非鱼，安知鱼之乐？这个问题牵涉到认知论的根本问题：某一个体何以知道其他个体的感受？然而，这对英国政治哲学家约翰·格雷（John Gray）而言却不成问题。他的研究领域为自由主义，著作甚丰，除此以外也写了三部以动物为主题的著作：《沉默的动物：论进步及其他现代神话》（The Silence of Animals: On Progress and Other Modern Myths）、《刍狗：对人类与其他动物的思考》（Straw Dogs: Thoughts on Humans and Other Animals），以及《猫哲学：猫与生命意义》（Feline Philosophy: Cats and the Meaning of Life）。
《猫哲学》这本书是资深猫奴铲屎官格雷与猫共同生活四十年的反思心得。在《猫哲学》一书最后致谢环节里，格雷感谢了促成此书写作的编辑朋友，还特别提及自…]]></summary>

对数百万个商业应用程序的研究显示，近 75% 的应用程序存在安全缺陷，并随着时间的增长而变得不那么安全。其中，82.2% 的.NET 应用程序存在缺陷，而 Java 的缺陷为 77.7%，JavaScript的缺陷为 55.8%。只有 9.5% 的 JavaScript 应用程序存在较严重的安全漏洞，而 Java 和 .NET 的比例分别为 19.9% 和 21.9%。此外，JavaScript 缺陷的修复速度也更快，其一半的缺陷平均在 116天内修复，而 .NET 为 158 天，Java 为 243 天。


消息来源：Dev Class



老王点评：这个结果有点出乎意料，专门为企业应用而设计的 Java 和 .NET 反而不如 JavaScript。




微软通过补丁检查过期的 Office 套件

微软打算通过更新推送一个补丁，来了解知道在 Windows PC 上安装了多少个超出支持范围的 Office 应用副本。该补丁主要检查的是已经停止支持的 Office 2007 和 2010，也包括今年 4 月将停止支持的 Office 2013。微软称，“这个更新将默默地运行一次，不会在用户的设备上安装任何东西”。微软没有提到它打算如何处理从更新中收集的数据。


消息来源：The Register



老王点评：微软这手未免伸的有的过长了，难道支持过期的 Office 就不能用了么？

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Signal was a brilliant app. It can send messages with rich media, host group chats, and even do voice and video calls, all with the peace of mind that comes from a proper secure messaging app. The best part was that you could still send messages to people who don't use Signal. Signal was the messaging app everyone wants - all the benefits of iMessage, without being siloed in one particular ecosystem.
Sometime leading up to October of 2022, the folks at the Signal foundation lost the plot. Signal has since dropped support for SMS, and is inexplicably adding "stories" to their personal messaging app. I despise this.
Instead of just complaining about it, I decided to do something about it. Here is a link to a version of the Signal Android app that still supports SMS, and doesn't have stories. There also isn't a stupid, nagging banner telling you to update. Right now, it's just Signal 5.38 with a couple lines commented out, but I plan to integrate any upstream security/UX improvements in the near future. For now, you'll have to build/install it yourself, but I will eventually put an APK out there for people to download. Enjoy!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Two months ago, we left our jobs at AWS and Figma to continue building Infisical.
It is an open-source end-to-end encrypted tool that helps you manage developer secrets across your team, devices, and infrastructure.
During the previous Show HN, we got a lot of useful feedback which we’ve been iterating on A LOT!
In the past month, we’ve been pretty much working 24/7, and we added:
- Integrations for Vercel, Netlify, GitHub Actions, Render, and Fly.io
- Public API
- User activity logs
- Point-in-time recovery and secret versioning
- Custom environments
- Kubernetes operator (https://infisical.com/docs/integrations/platforms/kubernetes)
And made lots of other performance improvements both on the frontend and backend.
Our repo is published under the MIT license so any developer can use Infisical. The goal is to not charge individual developers. We make money by charging a license fee for some enterprise features as well as providing a hosted version and support.
In the coming weeks, we plan to add features like key rotation, alerts, and secret groups - as well as continue adding more integrations.
Give it a try (https://github.com/Infisical/infisical)! We’d love to hear what you think!

Windows compatibility layer has been released.  The headline feature
appears to be the conversion to PE ("portable executable") modules:


	After 4 years of work, the PE conversion is finally complete: all

  	on the road to supporting various features such as copy protection,
  	32-bit applications on 64-bit hosts, Windows debuggers, x86

Other changes include WoW64 support (allowing 32-bit modules to call into

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi everyone! This is a quick update regarding my Linux portable install script!
 As a quick summary, I made a portable, customizable and modular linux install script which at the moment, uses ArchLinux as base
 The idea is that it is customizable, thus I can also use it as a template for other distros - though that is a WIP, please refer to this post for the detailed background and more information
 Now with that said, I have made some pretty (in my opinion) useful QoL changes as well as additional features to the installer
 The following are some of the bigger changes, as well as bug fixes ``` [New Features] - Command Line Arguments (CLI) support in install script that is simple to modify + -c | --config : For setting custom configuration file + -d | --target-disk : For setting target disk name via CLI argument + -g | --generate-config : For generating a new config file template right from the get-go + -h | --help : Display help message + -m | --mode : Set startup mode; DEBUG or RELEASE
 [Refactor/Modification] - Changed 'MODE' variable to a static DEBUG as the command line argument is now dynamic - Refactored global variables into individual functions for reusability (i.e. generating or resetting) ```
 The repository is here
 Feel free to dm me or comment below on what you think and/or if you have and inputs, or perhaps features you would like to see etc
 Thank you very much!
 P.S. I have also mentioned this in opensource, so you might have seen this there, thanks again!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[我们整体点评了最近发布的 EndeavourOS “Cassini”。


每年，个人和小型团队们推出了数以百计的 Linux 发行版。它们大多是 Debian、Ubuntu、Fedora 或 Arch Linux 的直接衍生品，再加上一些定制的东西。这也难怪每年都有因为缺乏贡献、愿景和坚持而死亡的发行版。

三年前，作为已停止的 Antergos 项目的延续，一个由贡献者们组成的小团队发起了 EndeavourOS 项目。从那时起，由于其安装简单，用户体验和功能，它已经变得很受欢迎。



点评 EndeavourOS

如果你曾经试过它，你就会很明显地发现，他们花了很多心血来开发这个发行版。这个发行版的口号是成为一个面向大众的 “通用” Arch Linux 发行版，摒弃了新用户对 Arch Linux 安装的恐惧，以及使用 Arch 时的优越感。

如果你曾经尝试过 EndeavourOS，你一定会 “感觉” 到作为一个 Arch 发行版，对最终用户来说，在桌面上执行的事情是多么的 “容易”。

安装和可供选择的桌面

通过 “独有的” Calamares 安装程序，它的安装变得超级简单。除此之外，EndeavourOS 团队还特别注意在安装步骤中为你提供了大部分的选项。例如，无需用户干预的临场介质直接启动。它会启动欢迎屏幕。欢迎屏幕要做的事就是提供让你在系统中安装它所有必要选项。



默认情况下，ISO 提供了一个轻量级的 Xfce 桌面。然而，EndeavourOS 也为你提供了各种桌面环境和窗口管理器（见下文）。而且它们都经过测试，可以正常工作。如果你在安装过程中连接到了互联网，你可以通过 Calamares 安装程序来安装这些。这意味着你不需要在基本的 Xfce 设置后重新安装它们。

此外，如果你是一个资深用户，只想安装一个基本的 …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[在这个简便的教程中，我们可以了解到 Java 中方法的定义，如何使用方法，以及何时使用方法。




Java 中的方法（在许多其他编程语言中称为“函数”）是被组合在一起并标记为可重用的一块代码。方法很有用，因为它们允许你在不重写相同代码的情况下，执行相同的操作或一系列操作，这不仅意味着你的工作量减少，还意味着出现问题时需要维护和调试的代码减少。

方法存在于类中，因此标准 Java 样板代码适用：

package com.opensource.example;

public class Example {
  // 在此写代码
}


在这样一个简单的单文件应用程序中，包定义并不是绝对必要的，但它是一个很好的习惯，而且大多数 IDE 都强制执行它。

默认情况下，Java 会寻找在类中运行的 main 方法。方法可以是公有的或私有的，也可以是静态的或非静态的，但 main 方法必须是公有的、静态的，Java 编译器才能识别和使用它。当方法是公有的时，它可以从类外部执行。要在程序启动时调用 Example 类，其 main 方法必须是可访问的，因此将其设置为 public。

下面是两个方法的简单演示：一个 main 方法在调用 Example 类时默认执行，另一个 report 方法接受 main 的输入并执行简单操作。

为了模拟任意数据输入，我使用了 if-then 语句，该语句根据你启动应用程序的时间在两个字符串之间进行选择。换句话说，main 方法首先设置一些数据（在现实生活中，这些数据可以来自用户输入，也可以来自应用程序其他地方的其他方法），然后 “调用” report方法，将处理后的数据作为输入提供：

package com.opensource.example;

public class Example {

麦克尼斯的卡里克弗格斯城堡令人想起另一座古堡——皮尔城堡，屹立在英格兰西北部坎布里亚郡的弗内斯半岛：
我曾与你为邻，你这粗粝的基石！
那年夏天整整四个星期我居于你的视野：
我每天都看见你；从始至终
你的身形睡在如镜的海面。

乔治·博蒙特爵士，《暴风雨中的皮尔城堡》，1806

1806年，华兹华斯在皇家美术学院的展览上看到乔治·博蒙特爵士的油画《暴风雨中的皮尔城堡》，写下这首挽歌。画中，城堡在雷电撕裂的天宇下岿然不动，一艘轮船在咆哮的大海上奋力抗争。人们一般认为这首挽歌写给一年前遭遇海难的弟弟约翰。但许多学者也指出，诗中哀叹的“悲痛”与“损失”也指向另一重回忆：“那年夏天整整四个星期”指的是1794年夏末，华兹华斯曾逗留于城堡附近的兰普塞德村庄，并在莱文沙滩上听闻罗伯斯庇尔的死讯。此前，1792年底，华兹华斯未及见到女儿出生就被迫离开革命的法国。1793年2月，英国对法宣战，更阻断了诗人与法国女友和女儿团聚的道路。因此，尽管挽歌中只字未提法国，城堡周围的景物显然构成他人生中一段动荡岁月的背景，一种涉及法国的生命损失在其中投下巨大的阴影。希尼曾用华兹华斯的案例来说明北爱尔兰少数群体诗人的典型情况：
当英国向革命的法国宣战，年轻的威廉·华兹华斯遭受了一种错位，与现在依然发生在爱尔兰的状况非常相似。这位英籍的大革命支持者怀有法国的政治理想，陷入了进退两难的困境。华兹华斯将这种困境戏剧化，忆起他在教堂参加为英军成功而进行的祈祷仪式时所感到的孤立、叛变与不忠。华兹华斯说，他的忠心突然裂开一个罅隙，引发令人迷失的巨力，给他的道德自我带来空前绝后的震动与打击。
希尼认为，华兹华斯在诗歌中讲述心灵的危机与复原，北爱尔兰的大部分诗歌也是如此，“写作的最大努力是整合，将全部的文化政治力量重新分配，使之获得差强人意的秩序”（189页）。
1813年，同在弗内斯半岛，华兹华斯写下《黑峡…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[本文将帮助你了解在 Ubuntu 和 Fedora 中设置 Python 开发环境的基础知识和步骤。


Python 由于其强大的库、简单的语法和可移植性，在过去几年中变得很流行。目前几乎所有的企业系统都在使用它。

因此，如果你正试图建立你的 Python 环境，并想知道如何开始等等，那么你就找到正确的地方了。在这里，我试图给你一些开始的步骤。

在 Ubuntu 和 Fedora 中设置 Python 开发环境

Python 版本

如果你刚刚开始 Python 开发，那么建议你使用最新的 Python 3.x 进行开发，因为 Python 2.x 已经不再支持了。几乎所有领先的 Linux 发行版都取消了对 Python 2 的依赖。

如果你正在运行 Fedora 或 Ubuntu 的最新发行版，那么你应该已经安装了 Python 3.x，并设置为默认解释器。例如，Fedora 37 和 Ubuntu 22.04 LTS 将 Python 3.11 作为默认的 Python 交互界面。

找到你的 Python 版本的一个快速方法是在 Ubuntu 和 Fedora 的终端运行以下命令：

python2


python3




如果你运行的是早期版本的 Ubuntu 或 Fedora，那么你可以使用以下命令安装最新的 Python 3.x：

Ubuntu：

sudo apt install python3


Fedora：

sudo dnf install python3


另外，运行下面的命令，找出当前系统中 Python 可执行文件的路径：

Which python


切换默认解释器的版本

如果你的系统安装了多个 Python 版本 —— 2.x 和 3.x，并且你想在它们之间切换，也是…]]></summary>

前几天，我们 报道（#882） 过，在没有告知的情况下，众多第三方 Twitter 客户端由于 API 访问受限而不能使用。现在 Twitter 给出了一个解释，“Twitter 正在执行其长期的 API 规则，这可能导致一些应用程序无法工作”。在其 API 规则中添加了一条新的规则，限制开发者“使用或访问授权材料去创建或尝试创建 Twitter 应用的替代或类似的服务或产品”。这意味着 Twitter 明确禁止了开发者开发第三方客户端。


消息来源：The Register



老王点评：我想说 Twitter “醒悟”的太晚了，凭啥让第三方客户端挣钱啊，瞧瞧它的某个山寨品早就干掉第三方客户端了。




因软件故障，7000 盏灯连续亮了 17 个月

美国麻省的一所高中十多年前安装了一种软件控制的照明控制系统，但在 2021 年该软件出现了故障，以至于所有的灯都无法关闭，这 7000 盏灯 24 小时点亮，一直亮了 17 个月。但是由于年代久远，安装该照明系统的公司也几经易手，已经没有修复该系统专有软件了。而更换整个照明系统需要替换大量硬件，一时也无法开展。


消息来源：ARS Technica



老王点评：一方面，软件的淘汰速度要比我们想象的要快，另外一方面，“古老”的电气开关看起来比软件更可靠。




用 AI 检测 AI 撰写的文字

一家从事反剽窃服务的公司正在开发一种新的工具，以检测 ChatGPT 等 AI 工具生成的文字。他们发现 AI 写作中有明显的模式，“人类并不倾向于在高概率的地方持续使用高概率的词，但 GPT-3 会这样做”。他们的检测器基于与 GPT-3 相同的架构，并将其描述为该 GPT-3 的微型版本。“它所做的是以与 GPT-3 阅读语言完全相同的方式阅读语言，但它不是吐出更多的语言。”而是显示一篇文章中似乎有多少是 AI 写的。他们认为该工具可以保护学术诚信。


消息来源：The Register



老王点评：AI 的进步我们只能顺应，而无法逆转。一方面我们要利用 AI 来替我们完成大量初级、重复的工作，另外一方面也可以利用 AI 来防止 AI 用在不当的地方。]]></summary>

网易告别信全文如下：



网易致魔兽国服玩家的告别信：感谢相伴14年


亲爱的暴雪游戏玩家：


2023年1月24日0时，由网之易代理的《魔兽世界》、《炉石传说》、《守望先锋》、《暗黑破坏神Ⅲ》、《魔兽争霸Ⅲ：重制版》、《风暴英雄》、《星际争霸》系列产品在中国大陆市场的所有运营将正式终止。届时，暴雪将关闭战网登录以及所有游戏服务器，同时关闭客户端下载。


相伴14年，说再见很难。我们一直清楚知道，对每个玩家，包括我们自己而言，所有的角色、账号、装备和好友列表，绝不仅仅是一串代码，而是我们的青春，我们的热血，我们的一段美好人生。所以，我们不会忘记对玩家的承诺，仍将尽最大努力，为暴雪国服玩家服务到最后一刻，与玩家共同走完最后一里路。我们将于停服后公布暴雪游戏产品的退款工作安排，请各位玩家关注“暴雪游戏服务中心”公众号。


与国服玩家相伴14年，除了感谢，我们更感荣幸。


感谢每个玩家对服务器的包容，对客服服务的理解，对黄金赛现场排队的耐心，甚至对暴雪游戏频道直播中的每一个广告都愿意忍受。


我们更荣幸，大家将人生最重要的青春时光，选择与我们共同度过。我们一起在游戏里与时间为敌，也在平凡的生活里打怪升级，一起创造不可复制的青春回忆。


我们永远记得，曾与每一个玩家在艾泽拉斯的世界里，迎战一个又一个强大的敌人；在炉石酒馆的闲暇中，思考、构筑、切磋牌技；在守望先锋和黑爪的战斗中，成为这个世界需要的英雄；也在庇护之地、在时空枢纽、在科普卢星区，书写篇章、挥洒热血。


这些美好的回忆，不会因停服而消逝，它们就像宝石一…]]></summary>

VirtualBox 是 Oracle 的一款流行的虚拟化软件，可用于 Linux、mac 和 Windows 系统。它是灵活的，并提供了许多功能来实现虚拟化。这是在 Windows 中体验 Ubuntu 而不安装它的最佳且简单的方法。然而，我强烈建议将 Ubuntu 以双引导的方式安装在物理机上，从而更好地体验 Ubuntu。

去年夏天，GNOME 邀请人们自愿在他们的系统上运行一个工具，以对系统配置方面的数据进行宏观统计。有 2560 人运行了这个工具，他们现在公布了这些数据。一些有趣的数据有：在受访者中，一半的用户在运行 Fedora；近 1/4 的用户使用的是联想的机器；90% 的系统都安装了 Flatpak；3/4 的默认浏览器是 Firefox；只有 1/10 的默认浏览器是 Chrome；83% 受访者安装了非默认的 GNOME 扩展。


消息来源：GNOME



老王点评：我最感兴趣这个安装扩展的比例，这充分说明了多样性的用户需求通过扩展的方式来满足是个好方法。




VSCode 扩展市场容易出现欺骗性扩展

根据调查，74.48% 的开发者在使用微软的 VSCode，几乎每个开发者都会使用扩展，而在 VSCode 市场上有超过 4 万个的扩展。研究发现，攻击者可以轻易地冒充流行的扩展，并欺骗不知情的开发者下载它们。一方面很难区分恶意扩展，扩展名称上的蓝色复选标记仅仅意味着发布者对随便一个域名的所有权。虽然 VSCode 市场会对每个新扩展和后续更新进行病毒扫描，并在发现恶意扩展时将其删除。但上传一个扩展，在被删除前很容易欺骗用户下载使用。最糟糕的是，VSCode 的扩展没有沙箱环境，这意味着扩展可以安装勒索软件、擦拭器和其他恶意代码，还可以改变你的本地代码，甚至使用你的 SSH 密钥来改变远程代码库中的代码。

老王点评：同样是扩展的话题，这个消息反映出来的潜在危险令人担心。我想微软应该对 VSCode 的扩展安全做更多的工作。]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[在本指南中，你将学习如何在 virt-manager 的 KVM、QEMU 和 libvirt 的主机和客户机之间共享文件夹。


virt-manager 应用或软件包使用 libvirt 库来提供虚拟机管理服务。它有一个桌面界面，有助于创建、删除和管理多个虚拟机。

virt-manager 桌面界面及其组件为各种个人和商业场景提供了灵活的虚拟机管理服务。它是一个自由开源的应用，主要用于 KVM 虚拟机。然而，它也可以支持其他管理程序，如 Xen 和 LXC。

在之前的文章中，我解释了 如何使用 virt-manager 创建虚拟机。这篇文章介绍了如何在客户机和主机之间无缝访问文件和文件夹。

关于 virtiofs 的说明

共享文件和文件夹是由名为 virtiofs 的 libvirt 共享文件系统提供的。它提供了访问主机上的目录树的所有功能和参数。由于大多数 virt-manager 虚拟机的配置都被翻译成 XML，所以共享文件/文件夹也可以通过 XML 文件来指定。

在 virt-manager中共享文件夹

首先，确保你的客户机关闭了电源。在 virt-manager GUI 中，选择虚拟机，点击“打开Open”，弹出控制台设置。



点击工具条上显示虚拟硬件细节的图标。然后点击左边面板上的“内存Memory”。

选择选项 “启用共享内存Enable shared memory”。点击应用。



然后点击底部的 “添加硬件Add hardware”。



在添加新硬件的窗口中，从左边的面板上选择 “文件系统File system”。

然后在 “细节Details” 标签中选择 “驱动程序Driver” 为 “virtiofs”。点击 “浏览Browse > 浏览本地browse local”，选择你想在客户机内访问的主机路径。

在目标路径中，输入你想要的任何名字。这只是一个文件标签，将在挂载时使用。

所以，如果我想访问 Pictures/Screenshots 文件夹（/home/debugpoint/Pictures/Screenshots），示例设置可以是这样：



下面是上述配置的 XML 设置。你可以在 XML 标签中找到它。

<filesystem type="mount" accessmode="passthrough">
  <driver type="virtiofs"/>
  <binary path="/usr/libexec/virtiofsd"/>
  <source dir="/home/debugpoint/Pictures/Screenshots"/>
  <target dir="mount_tag_pictures"/>
  <alias name="fs1"/>
  <address type="pci" domain="0x0000" bus="0x08" slot="0x00" function="0x0"/>
</filesystem>


点击 “完成Finish”。在 virt-manager 主窗口中，右键点击虚拟机，点击运行，启动虚拟机。确保点击“显示图形控制台show the graphical console”（如果虚拟机没有显示，点击工具条上的监视器图标）。

在客户机中，创建一个你想挂载主机文件夹的文件夹。在这个例子中，我使用了 /mnt/pictures。

sudo mkdir /mnt/pictures


最后，使用你在上述步骤中创建的标签将主机文件夹挂载到这个新文件夹。使用下面的命令在终端做这件事。确保根据你的系统改变下面命令中的标签和文件夹名称。

sudo mount -t virtiofs mount_tag_pictures /mnt/pictures


现在你可以在 virt-manager 中的主机和客户机之间的无缝地浏览文件夹和添加/删除项目。



总结

我希望这个方案能帮助你从客户机上访问主机文件和文件夹。记住，你的用户 ID，也就是用来启动 virt-manager 应用的用户，应该有同样的权限来访问主机文件夹。

如果你遇到任何错误，上述指南帮助了你，请在下面留言。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[路易斯·麦克尼斯（Louis MacNeice），1907-1963

希尼在牛津诗歌讲座最后一讲“写作的边界”中提出一种尝试：让国土的边界与写作的边界一致，由此勾勒一个完整的文学传统。他将这个传统描绘为五塔阵，“第一座塔位于中央，代表最初的爱尔兰性，岛上原始的圆塔住宅，或许就坐落于路易斯·麦克尼斯所说的‘孕育之山’”；以此塔为中心，南塔是斯宾塞的基尔克曼城堡（Kilcolman Castle），亦是英格兰征服与爱尔兰英化之塔；西塔是叶芝的诺曼风格城堡巴里郦（Ballylee），象征着他通过诗歌去复原被斯宾塞的军队和语言所摧毁的精神价值的努力；东塔是乔伊斯的圆形石塔，位于都柏林湾，《尤利西斯》的开篇场景，体现乔伊斯“将爱尔兰岛希腊化”的尝试。斯宾塞的塔楼直面原始神秘的爱尔兰圆塔，看到教皇、野蛮和黑暗的中世纪；叶芝的塔楼面向它，看到可能的统一，一个通过收回盖尔文化遗产而重获新生的爱尔兰国家；乔伊斯的塔面向它，看到“一个重建秩序的肚脐”，或“一座象牙塔，爱尔兰天主教保守的贞女必须被解放出来，投身欧洲的世俗自由”。最后，从北边进来，是卡里克弗格斯城堡（Carrickfergus Castle）——麦克尼斯最坚固的塔楼：
这座塔楼，奥伦治的威廉（William of Orange）曾在稳固新教继承权的途中着陆于此；世世代代为英军的驻扎之地；这座塔，在麦克尼斯的视野下，不再仅仅用回避的目光回顾光荣革命和议会之母，而且也能展望一个想象中的爱尔兰，其名字，用麦克尼斯的话来说，“始终如洪钟 / 回响在水下钟楼”。我以为，麦克尼斯以其英国原籍和文化教育，是斯宾塞的一个侧面；以其与康尼玛拉（Connemara）祖上及情感上的关联，是叶芝的一个侧面；以其神话的欧洲意识，是乔伊斯的一个侧面。通过将他的城堡写入诗歌编年史，他圆成了这个图表。他可以被视为一位爱尔兰新教作家，具有英国中心的态度，设法忠于…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[20 世纪 70 年代末期，计算机突然成为了某种普罗大众能够买回家的商品；而此前的几十年间，它一直只是听命于企业级霸主的神秘而笨重的机器。少数狂热的爱好者注意到了它是多么的吸引人，并争相购买了属于自己的计算机。对更多的人而言，微型计算机的到来引发了对未来的无助焦虑。同时期的杂志上的一则广告承诺，家用计算机将“让您的孩子在学校享有不公平的优势”。广告中展示了一位打着领带，身着时髦的西装外套的男孩子急切地举手回答问题，而在他的身后，他的那些显得不那么聪明的同学们闷闷不乐地望着他。这则广告以及其它类似的广告在暗示：世界正在疾速改变，而如果你不立即学习如何使用这些令人生畏的新设备之一，你和你的家人就会被时代所抛弃。

在英国，这些焦虑转化为政府高层对国家竞争力的担忧。从各种意义上，20 世纪 70 年代对英国来说都是平平无奇的十年，通胀与失业率高企。与此同时，一系列的罢工让伦敦陷于一次又一次的停电中。一篇 1979 年的政府报告担心：没有跟上计算机技术浪潮将“为我们糟糕的工业表现平添又一个影响因素”[1]。英国似乎已经在计算机技术的角逐中落后了 —— 所有的大型的计算机公司都是美国的，而集成电路则在日本和中国台湾制造。

由英国政府建立的公共服务广播公司英国广播公司（BBC）作出了一个大胆的举动，决定通过帮助英国人战胜他们对计算机的反感，来解决英国的国家竞争力问题。BBC 发起了 “计算机认知计划Computer Literacy Project”，该计划包括多个教育方向的努力：几部电视连续剧、一些相关书籍、一个支持团队网络以及一款名为 BBC Micro 的特别定制的微型计算机。该项目是如此成功，以致于 1983 年 《BYTE》杂志的一位编辑写道：“与美国相比，英国人对微型计算机感兴趣的比例更高。”[2] 这位编辑惊讶于在英国举办的 第五届个人计算机世界展Fifth Per…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[动视暴雪对网易的授权协议将于2023年1月23日到期，基于合约限制，1月24日0点起，暴雪《魔兽世界》《炉石传说》《守望先锋》《暗黑破坏神III》《星际争霸II》《魔兽争霸III：重制版》《风暴英雄》）等7款游戏国服将正式停运。


这意味着明天将是上述游戏国服运营的最后一天，明晚也将迎来游戏史上最大规模停服事件。


此前暴雪中国发布公告称，“网易拒绝暴雪顺延服务六个月”“网易想要IP控制权”。网易对于暴雪这则公告反驳称：暴雪的顺延提议及突发声明是蛮横、不得体且不符合商业逻辑的，并反问暴雪过分的自信中并未考虑这种予取予求、骑驴找马的行为，将玩家和网易置于何地。


有消息称，由于没有找到接盘的下家，暴雪再次找上了网易，想要跟网易再续签6个月的合同，合同细节都已经谈好了，分成比例什么的也没有变化，但是暴雪要求是签半年，而网易的要求最少签一年，两家最后自然是不欢而散。]]></summary>

	Ok, so I thought we were back to normal after the winter holidays

	sizable rc5, so I suspect there was still pent up testing and fixes
	from people being off.

	Anyway, I am expecting to do an rc8 this release regardless, just
	because we effectively had a lost week or two in the early rc's, so
	a sizable rc5 doesn't really worry me. I do hope we're done with

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[C++ 之父认为 Rust 的安全性并不优于 C++

C++ 之父 Bjarne 最近发布了一篇文章，号召认真思考 “安全” 问题；然后做一些明智的事情。Bjarne 对 NSA 关于软件内存安全的报告做出了回应，因为该报告将 C 和 C++ 排除在安全之外。Bjarne 不认为报告中任何一种 “安全” 语言的选择在他所关心的使用范围内比 C++ 优越。他认为，在 NSA 的文件中，“‘安全’仅限于内存安全，而忽略了语言可能（以及将）被用来违反某种形式的安全和保障的十几种其他方式。”


消息来源：Slashdot



老王点评：确实，安全缺陷本来不是 C++ 或者大部分流行的编程语言的一部分，编程的人才是安全漏洞的引入者。问题是，Rust 可以通过语言本身的机制来避免这些本可以避免的安全漏洞。




OpenAI 说 GPT-4 的 100 万亿参数数量是“胡说”

OpenAI 的 CEO 澄清了一些关于 GPT-4 的流言。他说 GPT-4 的发布没有确定的时间框架，“它会在某个时间点出现，当我们有信心能够安全和负责任地完成它时”。并称那张比较了 GPT-3（1750 亿）和 GPT-4（100 万亿）中的参数数量的图表“完全是胡说”。而对于通用人工智能（AGI），他说，“人们在乞求失望，他们会失望的……我们没有一个真正的 AGI。”他也认为 ChatGPT 将杀死谷歌的预测是错误的，“我确实认为搜索有一个变化，可能会在某个时候到来 —— 但变化短期内不会像人们想象的那样剧烈。”


消息来源：The Verge



老王点评：看到 OpenAI 的创始人还如此清醒，这很好。我也为我之前传播的那张错误的参数对比图道歉。




GitHub 将停止支持 Subversion

GitHub 宣布将于 2024 年 1 月 8 日停止支持 Subversion（SVN）。GitHub 是在 2010 年的愚人节这天宣布支持 Subversion 版本控制系统（一度被视为玩笑），当时集中式版本控制系统是主流，分布式版本控制系统如 Git 还是一个新人，还没有迹象显示它将统治世界。通过在 GitHub 后端原生支持 Subversion，GitHub 让用户能更容易迁移到 Git。今天 Git 在开发者中的使用比例高达 94%，Subversion 的使用比例越来越少。


消息来源：Solidot



老王点评：谁能想到，当年流行的 Subversion 等版本控制系统都被 Git 所取代了。想想，Linus 真是天命之子啊。]]></summary>

最近，当需要更新时，我一直在密切关注从产品和服务获得的变更日志。以下是一些示例：


修复了一些错误。

进行了一些可访问性改进。

我们已经进行了改进，并修复了错误，以实现更顺畅地运行。


当我想到我还是一名初级开发人员写的一些首次提交信息时，我不得不沮丧地垂下头：


用鼠标点了一下，现在一切似乎都正常了。

执行了程序员 X 告诉我的操作，现在横幅是蓝色的。


这可真令人沮丧！我向我们的贡献者们提出了以下问题：


什么是好的 Git 提交信息？

什么是坏的 Git 提交信息？

你认为一个项目应该有哪些关于提交信息所写内容的规则？


以下是他们的答案：

易阅读的文笔是关键

与你写任何东西一样，你应该考虑谁会阅读它。然后相应地调整信息的数量和深度。

提高你的自然语言和写作技能对于软件开发的职业生涯顺利发展至关重要。重要的不仅仅是代码。

—— Camilla Conte

具有描述性，不要假设

我在 OpenStack 社区中花了很多时间合作，与我在像“野外”的其他随意的项目中看到的相比，它的代码审查者有一些相当严格的标准。

我花在撰写一条可靠的提交信息的时间，往往要比编写实际的代码实现或修复程序的时间长得多。有时，提交信息可能会比它们解释的代码变化长很多倍。

总结一些贡献者指导：


描述为什么要做出改变，而不仅仅是改变了什么

第一个提交行是最重要的（就像电子邮件的主题行）

不要假设审查者了解你正在修复的原始问题

不要假设审查者可以访问外部 Web 服务或网站（总结缺陷报告和其他相关讨论）

不要假设代码是不言自明的和自我说明的（尽管没有必要重复你在代码注释中也提出的观点）

不要只包含与更改的早期…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[周松芳（章静 绘）

文史学者、专栏作家周松芳先生常年在媒体撰写饮食文化专栏，著有《岭南饕餮：广东饮膳九章》《民国味道：岭南饮食的黄金时代》《海派粤菜与海外粤菜》《饮食西游记：晚清民国海外中餐馆的历史与文化》《民国粤味：粤菜师傅的老菜谱》《粤菜北渐记》等多部饮食文化著作。与很多美食作家不同的是，他特别注重从史料中爬梳饮食文化在国内外传播的资料，将其置于近代中国政治、经济、文化变迁的视野下，别具一格。在接受《上海书评》的专访中，他认为：市场会重塑饮食文化，会使其在包容吸收的同时再重新突出自己的特色；从晚清民国迄于今日，没有市场就没有传播，没有传播就没有菜系的形成和发展。

《粤菜北渐记》，周松芳著，东方出版中心2022年8月出版，295页，49.80元


《饮食西游记》，周松芳著，生活·读书·新知三联书店2022年4月出版，295页，48.00元

说到饮食文化在国内的传播，粤菜和川菜似乎在各地最为盛行，所以粤菜北渐是避不开的，能否先介绍下粤菜在民国时期北上的进程和盛衰之势？
周松芳：菜系的跨区域传播，是晚近以来的事，李一氓先生说：“限于交通条件、人民生活水平和职业厨师的缺乏，跨省建立饮食行业是很不容易的。解放以前大概只有北京、上海、南京、香港有跨地区经营的现象。”当然时限没有这么晚，范围和规模也没有这么小。粤菜的向外传播，主要是在五口通商之后。此前，虽然如屈大均《广东新语》所说：“广州望县，人多务贾与时逐，以香、糖、果箱、铁器、藤、腊、番椒、苏木、蒲葵诸货，北走豫章、吴浙，西北走长沙、汉口。”但早期的商业都会中，是没有粤菜馆的，或者说粤商在各地的会馆提供了粤菜馆的功能，像在北京，即便民国粤菜馆兴起之后，会馆的饮食功能仍然不可或缺，容庚先生居京之时，就屡屡就食于东莞会馆。
粤菜北渐，首上海而次北京。五口通商之后，上海迅速取代广州成为最重要的通商口岸，粤商也蜂拥北上，特别是外…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[遇见 Wordbook：一个 GNOME 桌面的离线词典应用。


我们大多在谷歌、DDG 或其他搜索引擎上搜索单词信息，如含义、同义词、反义词等。

由于今天几乎每个人都有一个连接互联网的手机，在谷歌上搜索可能更容易。

但对于离线使用，在没有互联网连接的情况下，你可以尝试 Wordbook。

Wordbook：离线词典应用

这个应用在本质上是非常基础的，但它的能力足以完成工作。Wordbook 目前支持一个英英字典。在其核心部分，它使用 Open English WordNet 数据库 进行定义。Open English Wordnet 是 Princeton Wordnet项目 的一个开源复刻。

Wordbook 应用还可以使用 eSpeak – 一个自由开源的语音合成器来发音。



然而，在第一次运行时，它需要一次性上网，以下载离线数据。仅此而已。其他值得注意的功能包括实时搜索、双击搜索和带有 HTML 标记的自定义定义。

Wordbook 是一个 GNOME 应用，使用现代的 GTK4 和 libadwaita 构建。因此，它与 GNOME 桌面的浅色和深色主题整合得很好。你也可以使用 Wordbook 的随机单词功能来学习新单词以增加你的词汇量。

安装

你可以很容易地从 Flathub 将其作为 Flatpak 应用安装。为 Flatpak 和 Flathub 设置你的系统，然后从终端使用以下命令安装它：

flatpak install com.github.fushinari.Wordbook


安装后，你可以在应用菜单中找到它。

结束语

我希望你在学校或商业工作中使用这个小小的应用。如果你在写论文和较长的段落，离线特性是很方便的。

你知道其他 Linux 的离线字典吗？请在评论栏里告诉我们。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A quick Google search will say that it isn't possible to modify an installed Snap. But in the process of writing a script to bypass Firefox's extension walled garden, I decided I didn't care what the internet thought and did it anyways.
 So here's how to modify a Snap!
 Note: This process was written for Ubuntu systems, it might be slightly different on other distributions. Also, future updates to Snap itself could break it.
  
Open a terminal.
 Find the version of the Snap you have installed: snap list | grep '<Snap Name Here!>' | awk '{print $3}'.
 This means the Snap itself is stored at /var/lib/snapd/snaps/<Snap Name Here!>_<Snap Version Here!>.snap.
 Unmount the Snap: sudo systemctl stop "snap-<Snap Name Here!>-<Snap Version Here!>.mount".
 Run sudo /usr/lib/snapd/snap-discard-ns <Sna…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi. I'm a (not so proud) owner of an AMD A6-4400M (2.7 GHz dual core) laptop and I'm struggling to get Linux working on this elder one. It's basically a HP G4 from 2011 or so, with 4gb ram and a 120GB SSD.
 I tried to install Fedora 36 and 37 but things were very very weird, even the mouse wasn't as smooth as it should. I though it was because it's a crappy machine, but even lubuntu was taking long time to open any app, plus everything looked like freezing.
 I didn't tried any other distro, but was forced to reinstall windows 8, which surprisingly worked better than I was expecting. The problem is I am a Linux-派 and would appreciate if there's a distro I could run into it.
 PS: I'm very broke, so I can't buy anything right now, especially since I'm not from US/Canada and dollar conversion goes bananas very quickly. 
 PS2: My main use is toward studying and programming, some very light games and movie watching.

I’d love to try one of these out. I have a modern computer so I’m guessing it’ll have to be emulated somehow, but what do you recommend as a great text based game to try? Like ones that really make you think and get creative

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This is kind of a tip-of-my-tongue question ... because I can't for the life of me find a project anymore. At a conference a few years back someone presented a container runtime that was completely self-contained. You basically built a statically linked binary that - probably similar to AppImage - extracted the actual application and ran it in a containerized setting ... probably using cgroups directly. Neither docker, nor podman nor anything of the likes was involved.
 The focus was clearly to pack and distribute services to be run in corporate settings.
 I can't find it anymore. I am going through all my bookmarks, notes, tried tons of different google searches. Nothing.
 Can anyone remember this project as well? If so: link?

上个月，谷歌的创始人拉里·佩奇和谢尔盖·布林与该公司高管举行了几次会议，以应对 ChatGPT 对该公司的搜索业务的挑战。对谷歌来说，ChatGPT 看起来似乎可以提供一种在互联网上搜索信息的新方法。这两位创始人自从 2019 年离开谷歌的日常工作后，就没有在该公司呆过多少时间，他们审查了谷歌的人工智能产品战略，批准了将更多聊天机器人功能纳入谷歌搜索引擎的计划并提出了想法。


消息来源：《纽约时报》



老王点评：当年靠着搜索变成了一家独大，如今却有可能被 AI 掀翻。




苹果开源了 40 年的 Lisa 操作系统

作为苹果 Lisa 电脑发布四十周年庆典的一部分，苹果通过计算机历史博物馆公开了 Lisa OS 3.1 操作系统的源代码，它采用了苹果学术许可证协议，包括 26MB 源代码，超过 1300 个源文件。苹果 Lisa 发布于 1983 年 1 月 19 日，其名字来自于乔布斯的女儿。它是一款基于鼠标 GUI 的商用计算机，但由于太过昂贵而在商业上失败，苹果于 1985 年终止了该项目。但它为之后的 Macintosh 奠定了基础。


消息来源：计算机历史博物馆



老王点评：欢迎苹果公司将古老的操作系统“文物”放入博物馆。




美科技公司反对对科技算法提起诉讼

在美国最高法院关于 YouTube 算法的一个关键案件中，众多企业、互联网用户、学者甚至人权专家为大科技公司的责任盾牌辩护，他们认为，如果将人工智能驱动的推荐引擎排除在联邦法律保护之外，会对开放的互联网造成全面的改变。他们表示美国联邦法律《通信礼仪法》第 230 条对网络的基本功能至关重要，该法条被用来保护所有网站使其免受第三方内容的诉讼。他们认为，允许对科技行业算法提起诉讼的裁决，可能会甚至导致未来对非算法形式的推荐提起诉讼，并可能对个别互联网用户提起有针对性的诉讼。


消息来源：CNN



老王点评：算法有罪吗？有意的算法作恶应该被惩处吗？无意的算法错误应该被惩罚吗？黑盒式的 AI 决策的责任该由谁承担？这个信息时代打破了很多既有认知。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[一个不错的 GNOME 扩展：Colorblind Filters，它为色盲用户带来了许多调整选项。


无障碍是计算和操作系统的一个重要方面。它包括对视力障碍、色盲和许多其他健康症状的管理设置。流行的 Linux 桌面环境，如 GNOME 和 KDE Plasma，具有无障碍设置，以帮助所有这些情况。

感谢 GNOME 扩展生态系统，有大量的专门扩展可以帮助这些用户。我遇到的其中一个扩展是“Colorblind Filters”。

Colorblind Filters – GNOME 扩展

根据维基百科，"色盲通常涉及无法区分红色和绿色的深浅。遗传性色盲症没有治疗方法。如果色盲是由其他疾病引起的，治疗潜在的原因会有帮助。"。

因此，你有可以调整你的 Linux 桌面设置的选项是很重要的。

设置扩展程序和 Flatpak

首先，确保你已经启用了 Flatpak 和 GNOME 扩展。并且安装了扩展管理器。你可以参考这个关于如何 设置 flatpak 和启用 GNOME 扩展 的详细指南，或者从终端运行以下命令（对于 Ubuntu、Linux Mint 等）。

sudo apt install flatpak
sudo apt install gnome-software-plugin-flatpak
flatpak remote-add --if-not-exists flathub https://flathub.org/repo/flathub.flatpakrepo
reboot



对于 Fedora 用户，使用以下命令。

sudo dnf install flatpak
sudo dnf install gnome-software-plugin-flatpak
flatpak remote-add --if-not-exists flathub https://flathub.org/repo/flathub.flatpakrepo
reboot


完成后，安装扩展管理器：

flatpak install com.mattjakeman.ExtensionManager


安装扩展

从应用菜单中打开扩展管理器。搜索 “colorblind”。并安装该扩展（见下图）。



安装后，你可以在系统托盘上看到一个小眼睛图标。你可以点击它来启用预定义的颜色过滤器。



右键点击眼睛图标以获得更多设置。这个扩展带来了色盲集合、模拟和额外选项的所有必要定制。目前有以下选项：


纠正和模拟（具有高对比度）

红色盲

绿色盲

蓝黄色盲



额外的调整

GBR 和 BRG 的通道混合器

亮度反转

颜色反转






使用最适合你的眼睛的那个。

总结

我认为苹果的 macOS 和 iOS 已经实现了比 Windows 或 Linux 更好的无障碍。然而，Linux 桌面在这些应用和扩展方面也不落后。另外，还有一些专门的 Linux 发行版，如 “Accessible Coconut”，它是为专门的需求而建立的。

我希望 Colorblind GNOME 扩展对你日常使用 Linux 和 GNOME 桌面有帮助。

干杯。

是时候向 2022 年说再见了！📆

2022 年有很多发行版发布，其中有一些非常出色。

随着人们越来越关注用户体验和性能，Linux 发行版在过去的一年中有了显著的发展。

对于你我这样的最终用户，可以有几个选择。你可以尝试一些 对初学者友好的选项 或者尝试一些 面向资深用户的发行版。

在本文中，我将重点介绍一些你可以尝试一下看看的新发行版。这些发行版可能不一定能取代现有的流行发行版。但是，如果你想尝试一些新的东西，可以试试列表中的这些。

所以，你在 2023 年可以期待什么？🤔

好吧，为了回答这个问题，让我们踏上发行版之旅吧！


💡 新的发行版可能不适合生产环境。如果你不介意尝试新的东西，可以尝试这些选项。


1、Vanilla OS



Vanilla OS 是一个基于 Ubuntu 的发行版，它是 Bottles 的创建者 Mirko Brombin 的心血结晶。

它旨在提供一个具有**干净、原生的 GNOME 体验，以及按需不变性on-demand immutability**和优秀的首次安装体验。


LCTT 译注：按需不变性on-demand immutability，指一个可以按需让文件不可更改的功能，用于确保系统文件不会被随意更新。 可参考 此链接。


如果你想尝试一些新的东西并且想尝试一下按需不变性这个令 Vanilla OS 如此独特的功能，可以尝试一下这个发行版。

它还没有稳定版本，在一段时间内也不会有，预计将在 2023 年进行许多改进。


Vanilla OS


2、XeroLinux

读《青蛙有灵魂吗》，我完全沉浸在十九世纪的科学世界里。有时候，思绪还将我带回到二十世纪末的大学课堂里，动手解剖，观摩动物心脏的跳动、肠胃蠕动、神经反射等等的场景历历在目。“青蛙有灵魂吗”原本是英国科学家托马斯·赫胥黎（Thomas Henry Huxley）于1870年在形而上学协会会议上的一个演讲主题。我手捧着的《青蛙有灵魂吗》当中囊括的七个主题为维多利亚时代的科普热点，包括了当时的生物学前沿知识，蕴含了人们感兴趣的哲学话题，如今读来，意义已经超过了书中文字的承载力。
一、穷小子的逆袭人生
赫胥黎以支持达尔文的演化论最为知名，被世人称为达尔文的斗牛犬。这种说法给人留下了他在科学史上的地位不如达尔文的印象，颇失公允。赫胥黎自身就是一位杰出的科学家，一直为推动英国的教育改革摇旗呐喊。坊间甚至流传，没有他的鼓励，《物种起源》就没有那么快面世。
1825年，赫胥黎出生于一个中产家庭，父亲在学校任职。不幸的是，在他幼年时期，学校关闭，父亲失业了。经济支柱轰然倒塌，兄弟姐妹众多，赫胥黎八岁才得以步入学堂，仅仅接受了两年的正规教育。之后，他便开启了自学成才的道路，绘画、机械工程、德语和科学，样样精通。

1908年的毛囊横断面图，其中有赫胥黎层

十六岁时，他给一位行医的姐夫当学徒。十七岁那年，他获得了查令十字医院的奖学金，有幸进入大学习医。期间，他发现了人类毛囊里的一层构造，即赫胥黎层（Huxley’s layer）。这一发现成就了他的第一篇科学论文。可惜的是，在通过了初次医学考试不久，他便失去了奖学金的资助，不得已借钱度日。负债累累的他不得不放弃后半段考试，这导致了他与一纸文凭失之交臂。
为了还债，1846年，他以外科医生的身份加入海军队…]]></summary>

my root volume had been set up to 'never' do a fsck at boot.
 I can force a fsck by putting fsck.mode=force on the boot command line in grub
 Or I can force a fsck on next boot with touch /force…]]></summary>

----
I'm 37.  I spent my twenties bouncing all over the place; did a stint in the Army Reserves while shooting for liutenant bars that didn't work out (failed out of college and I was in ROTC).  Did construction, real estate, grew weed in Denver for a year (legally), ended up bartending for roughly a decade.  It was great in my early 20s.  Not so hot to watch my age group get raises and salary increases.
I have my GED and never finished college - left with a record-setting 1.2 GPA (I have severe ADD and I wasn't properly medicated, there were other problems too).  Seemed like there was this universe of 'good jobs' that …]]></summary>

        <updated>2023-01-20T22:14:29.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The kernel thread “kugepaged” is created using the “kthread_run()” function (https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/latest/source/mm/khugepaged.c#L2551). It is responsible for the “Transparent Hugepage Support” (aka THP). “kugepaged” scans memory and collapses sequences of basic pages into huge pages (https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/admin-guide/mm/transhuge.html). 
 We can manage and configure TPH using sysfs (https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/admin-guide/mm/transhuge.html#thp-sysfs) or by using the syscalls “madvise” (https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/madvise.2.html) and “prctl” (https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/prctl.2.html). 
 The scan of memory is done by calling “khugepaged_do_scan()” https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/latest/source/mm/khugepaged.c#L2404 which in turn calls “khugepaged_scan_mm_slot()” (https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/latest/source/mm/khugepaged.c#L2232). In order to demonstrate that I have used the following bpftrace oneliner “sudo bpftrace -e 'kfunc:khugepaged_scan_mm_slot{ printf("%s:%d\n",curtask->comm,curtask->pid); }'”. The output is shown in the screenshot below. 
 Lastly, we can also monitor the modifications made by “khugepaged” by checking the information on “/proc”. For example we can check the “AnonHugePages”/”ShmemPmdMapped”/”ShmemHugePages” in “/proc/meminfo”, which is global for the entire system. If we want information regarding a specific process/task we can use “/proc/[PID]/smaps” and count “AnonHugePages”/”FileHugeMapped” for each mapping (https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/admin-guide/mm/transhuge.html).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Yesterday I made a discovery that LXC container CPUs are pinned to a host CPU. In Proxmox this is random (AFAICT). And by randomly, I mean no consideration is made for the host CPU load. Moreover, I wasn't expecting pinning. This seems like a suboptimal resource sharing algorithm. I realize you can specify which host CPUs are used and what percent usage you want, but that lacks flexibility.
 The rub is if you have 2 (or more) containers pinned to the same CPU. They could be contending for processor resources while other host CPUs are idle, under utilized, or running low priority (nice) processes.
 This revelation has made me rethink containerization and suddenly I'm in the weeds trying to discover how to optimally share host resources among (K)VMs, LXC, and Docker, what type of process scheduling they use, how to deal with workloads that vary, etc.
 I don't really have anything useful to share other than to generate awareness with other users. Frankly I'm kind of exasperated.

此前暴雪曾公告，将在今年1月24日0点起中止国服游戏服务。


暴雪表示，“通用下载”功能是安全的，提供一个涵盖角色信息、装备和游戏进度的综合存档，以期在《魔兽世界》国服重新开放时使用。


所谓的“进度存档”，指的是此前1月18日，《魔兽世界》国服推出“电子骨灰盒”功能，玩家可以下载各自的游戏进度以备未来使用。将来国服游戏重新上线时，就可以上传手中保存的游戏历史，这项功能将持续开通至国服停服。


暴雪还特别强调，这项功能是对网之易涉及所有《魔兽世界》国服玩家的数据封存的额外补充，让玩家把数据掌握在自己手里，主要面向的是希望在游戏服务终止后自己也保留游玩历史的人。


值得注意的是，在回复“玩家的虚拟财产可能遭到损失吗？暴雪会承担这个责任吗？”提问时，暴雪回复称，该功能是安全的，以期在《魔兽世界》国服重新开放时使用。此外，该功能是对网之易的数据封存的额外补充，网之易对这部分数据负责。


但此前1月17日，网易曾发布声明称，暴雪应该为玩家虚拟财产损失或无法游戏承担全部责任。“对于暴雪中国在其声明中提到的关于2023年1月18日推出的《魔兽世界》游戏进度存档功能，有义务提醒所有玩家，该功能为暴雪单方面提出并开发上线，未经网易方面测试、使用可能存在未知安全隐患。”


“网易作为暴雪游戏的中国代理商，需要根据双方代理协议的约定履行游戏运营、推广等义务，但包括游戏版权在内的相关权益本身是属于暴雪公司的，玩家也是与暴雪公司之间存在网络游戏服务合同关系。”上海…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[安卓 13 占比已超过 5%，原因可能你不知道

根据谷歌最新的官方安卓分布数据，安卓 13 在发布后不到 6 个月的时间里，已运行在 5.2% 的设备上。以往，最新版本的安卓在半年后也比这个比例少得多。这主要归功于安卓开发和部署方式的结构性变化。2017 年推出的 Project Treble 项目重新架构了平台，将操作系统框架与底层供应商代码分开。这使得更新设备更容易，而无需等待供应商提供更新的驱动程序。


消息来源：9to5google



老王点评：原来新安卓系统快速普及的背后是有原因的。👍




ChatGPT 被列为论文署名作者，你同意吗？

至少有四篇论文或预印本将 AI 聊天机器人 ChatGPT 列为署名作者。ChatGPT 通过模仿其训练的庞大文本能生成令人信服的语句，它在学术界引发了争议，因为它给出的陈述不一定正确。一些期刊出版商和预印本服务认为，将 ChatGPT 等 AI 列为署名作者是不合适的，因为它无法对论文内容和完整性负责。而另外一些出版商认为 AI 对论文撰写的贡献可以写在署名作者列表之外的部分。


消息来源：《自然》



老王点评：我觉得，哪怕就是提供初步的提纲或进行润色填充，也值得署个名。🤣




勒索软件受害者付款金额大幅下降，但不是因为攻击减少

据研究，自 2019 年以来，受害者的支付率从 76% 下降到 41%。数据显示，去年勒索软件的总收入至少下降到 4.6 亿美元，比 2021 年的 7.7 亿美元下降了 40%。而据另外的数据，2021 年至 2022 年的勒索攻击数量仅仅下降了 10.4%。这一金额的降低的主要原因是，支付赎金可能带来严重的法律后果。此外，最终偿还公司赎金的网络安全保险公司也要求在签发或续签保单之前，企业必须证明他们已经有了相应的工具和措施，以防止被勒索软件攻击。


消息来源：The Register



老王点评：看来猖獗的勒索软件攻击终于达到了一定的制约。😎]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[我写了一个名为 “Toy CPU” 的教育性复古计算机程序，以便我的学生能够学习机器语言。


我兼职教授大学课程，包括一个对所有专业开放的一般计算机主题的课程。这是一门入门课程，向学生讲授技术是如何运作的，以消除围绕计算的神秘感。

虽然不是计算机科学课程，但这门课的一个部分涉及计算机编程。我通常用非常抽象的术语谈论编程，所以不会让听众听不懂。但是今年，我想让我的学生以 “老派” 的方式做一些需要 “动手” 的编程。同时，我又想保持简单，以便让每个人都能跟上。

我喜欢将我的课程结构化，以显示你是如何从 “那里” 到 “这里” 的。理想情况下，我会让我的学生学习如何编写一个简单的程序。然后，我将从这里开始，展示现代编程是如何让开发人员创建更复杂的程序的。我决定尝试一种非常规的方法 —— 教学生学习终极的低级别编程语言：机器语言。

机器语言编程

早期的个人电脑如 Apple II（1977 年）、TRS-80（1977 年）和 IBM PC（1981 年）让用户用键盘输入程序，并在屏幕上显示结果。但计算机并不总是带有屏幕和键盘。

Altair 8800 和 IMSAI 8080（均为 1975 年制造）要求用户使用面板上的 “开关和灯” 输入程序。你可以用机器语言输入指令，使用一组开关，机器会点亮 LED 灯以代表每个二进制指令的 1 和 0。



对这些早期机器进行编程，需要了解被称为 “操作码opcode” （操作代码的简称）的机器语言指令，以执行基本操作，如将两个数字相加或将一个值存储到计算机的存储器中。我想向我的学生展示程序员是如何通过开关和灯，手工输入一系列指令和内存地址的。

然而，在这门课上，使用实际的 Altair 8800 就有点太复杂了。我需要一些简单的、任何初级水平的学生都能掌握的东西。理想情况下，我希望能找到一个简单的 “…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Having searched this and other linux related subs, I found that many questions were asked in this regard but with few solutions. For those who don't know, ShareX is a light-weight screen recorder app which bundles in several features like not just taking screenshots and uploading to sites like Imgur, etc. but also creating actual screencasts or video recordings, using both desktop and webcam as input device.
 This is very useful for small Youtubers, Freelancers, etc. who want to create videos or desktop recording content. In linux world, the closest that comes to this is perhaps OBS studio but that's a bit heavy and not quite usable on older machines with lesser RAM. Do you know of any lighter alternatives?

2011年Ghost on the Throne（中译本为《王座上的幽灵》）刚出版的时候，我第一时间购读了这本书。在十多年前几乎同时出版的几本关于继业者战争的著作中，此书给我的印象是最深刻的。所谓继业者，说的便是亚历山大大帝死后，参与争夺、分割他帝国的诸多将帅。本书作者的视角可谓独具一格，为我们刻画出了一代神王亚历山大大帝阴影之下的凡人群像。无论是修成正果、最终建立起自己王朝的成功者，还是在时代的大潮中身不由己、最终粉身碎骨的失败者，都难免被无常的命运所支配。书中那些单纯想保卫自己城市的希腊政治家，或者是身在遥远东方只想回家的普通士兵的结局，更是让人感慨不已。
亚历山大大帝是幸运的。在他最后几年的统治中，扩张过快的马其顿帝国已经出现了一系列严重危机：甚至在他生前，印度河流域的部分占领区实际上已经起来驱逐马其顿驻军了；无论戍守在中亚还是希腊本土的希腊人都不愿再服从亚历山大，在他远征印度时已经有过骚乱，更大范围的全面叛乱正在酝酿中；在马其顿本土摄政的安提帕特与亚历山大关系急剧恶化，亚历山大不得不派克拉特鲁斯带兵去取代他；就算在亚历山大身边，都充满了不满他各种政策的马其顿贵族，亚历山大最后几年因此清洗了大批东方行省的总督。可以说，如果亚历山大再多活几十年，“自我得之，自我失之”这个成语很可能就要应验在他身上了。某种程度上看，亚历山大本人在开创了前所未有功业之后的英年早逝，反而帮助他实现了自己形象在一段时间内的完美化和神格化。《王座上的幽灵》这本书中的故事，就是从这个时间开始的。
绝大部分关于继业者战争的通俗读物会将时间线延伸到伊普苏斯战役或是塞琉古遇刺，但《王座上的幽灵》却独辟蹊径。作者并没有选择全景式的描绘继业者战争，而是选择在…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This isn't another complaining post, there's just something that doesn't add up and that I can't find any answer for online. As you know, Fedora recently removed some patents from their main repository for legal reasons. This makes sense because they're associated with a company, and therefore are beholden to patent laws. But weren't those codecs there for years before this? So did they just not care in the past or did they somehow miss the fact that they were violating a patent for years? And if so, how could they miss that? How did their legal department miss that?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Google Project Zero page shows
how to compromise the kernel by using a NULL pointer to repeatedly
force an oops and overflow a reference count.


	Back when the kernel was able to access userland memory without
	restriction, and userland programs were still able to map the zero
	page, there were many easy techniques for exploiting null-deref
	bugs. However with the introduction of modern exploit mitigations
	such as SMEP and SMAP, as well as mmap_min_addr preventing
	unprivileged programs from mmap’ing low addresses, null-deref bugs
	are generally not considered a security issue in modern kernel
	versions. This blog post provides an exploit
	technique demonstrating that treating these bugs as universally
	innocuous often leads to faulty evaluations of their relevance to
	security.


This is the sort of vulnerability that the
oops-limit patch is meant to block.]]></summary>

Odigos is an open-source project that lets you instantly generate distributed traces for your applications. It works alongside existing monitoring tools and does not require any code changes.
Our earlier experiences with monitoring tools were frustrating. Monitoring a distributed system with multiple microservices, we found ourselves spending way too much time trying to locate the specific microservice that was at the root of a problem. For example, we once spent hours debugging an application which we suspected was causing high latency, only to find out that the actual problem was rooted in a completely different application
Then we learned about distributed tracing, which solves exactly this problem.…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[无论你是刚刚开始在你的组织中使用 DevOps，还是仅仅想改善你现有的文化，请考虑这些技巧以及它们与你组织的未来的关系。




你为什么要构建 DevOps 文化？开发团队和运维团队的精简协作有很多好处。效率是首要目标：提高新软件部署的速度，减少等待的时间。培养同事之间的信任可以提升员工的满意度，激发新的创新，并对盈利能力产生积极的影响。

DevOps 是一个很广泛的思想，大家的理解也见仁见智。每个公司对于如何实行 DevOps 也各不相同。这种意见的多样性实际上是一件好事 —— 这么多的观点对于建立更强大的团队是很有用的。本指南将探讨在 DevOps 文化中鼓励同事之间更好地合作的最高技巧。

下面每个部分从不同的视角介绍 DevOps 文化，并探讨了将它引入员工队伍的方法。



流程的持续发展

DevOps 文化的这一核心原则使它与许多其他类型的工作场所的风气区别开来。DevOps 哲学说，犯错是有积极意义的，因为这表明你在尝试新的想法。

DevOps 文化的核心是不停地创造。实际上，这意味着当测试结果显示事情由于你的改动而变坏时，不要懊恼。我们要认识到，进化的过程不是线性的，通往成功的道路也从来不是一条直线。

DevOps 专家 Gene Kim 主张勇于承担风险和进行实验。鼓励你的团队尝试不寻常的任务，以得到新的领悟。

你的组织应该以利润为导向吗？你能允许你的团队尝试一些新东西（非指个人兴趣项目）吗？持续的流程发展意味着对升级目前的方法持开放态度。优秀的销售领导懂得，结果比出勤率更重要，因此，关注团队的工作方式而不是工作量的多少始终是关键。

随时提供反馈并积极寻求反馈

成员之间增加信任是蓬勃发展的 DevOps 文化的另一个关键特征。无论你的员工是在学习如何建立联盟网络联系，还是试图设计他们的下一个 用户体验 调查，每个人…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've always had trouble with note taking, digitally. You open the file browser, browse to an appropriate directory to store the text file in, give it a proper name. If you're using a note taking app, you open it, you go to the proper notebook/section, you create a new note, you give it a name, maybe you have to worry about formatting...
 End result: text files everywhere in my system with random meaningless names: 111.txt, aa.txt, note.txt. Most of them probably were created for temporary needs and are now obsolete. Yet you're never not too lazy to find them and delete them. Imagine having to clean up every single thought you have in your brain as well?
 I often find the things between the idea in my head and the act of writing it down just very inefficient. And I've always dreamed of this simple yet effective solution. A note-taking app that is 24/7 running in the background. You open it with dragging the left or right edge of your screen, this spawns a sidebar, with a new empty note opened. And you just write.
 This app has 1 search/filter bar at the top, and all the notes are listed down sorted by the time of creation. Most recent at the top. You can pin/favorite. And optionally you can make notes auto-deleted by default unless you click on a "keep" button, if you find it tedious having to delete obsolete notes. And finally you can sort by type, if the note has a lot of - at the beginning of each line, that means it's probably a list and it automatically is marked as a list, this should make it easier to filter out later on.
 Features can be expanded, but the base idea is the most crucial aspect. I have used many note taking apps, but I never really use them when I'm in a hurry and just want to write down a random idea. I see myself just create text files in the desktop or home to do that.
 What do you think?

在 DNS over TLS 之前，DNS 查询由于技术原因会被投毒，从而导致客户端访问到投毒者设置的假冒地址。为了避免这种安全风险，最好的方式是使用 DNS over TLS 这样的加密查询通道。但是仍然有大量的 DNS 服务器没有或不能使用加密查询。谷歌从 2009 年就在小范围实验一种名为 0x20 的做法，它可以将查询的域名随机改变字母大小写，这可以有效的提高 DNS 投毒的难度。现在谷歌已经扩大了该方案，已经覆盖了 90% 没有使用加密查询的 DNS 服务器。

老王点评：以后在你的权威 DNS 服务器上看到类似 liNUx.cN 这样的查询不要惊奇。

安全启动是 UEFI 主板固件中的一项安全功能，确保在启动过程中只有受信任的（签名）软件可以执行。研究发现，微星公司在 2021 年 9 月至 2022 年 1 月期间发布的固件更新，改变了微星主板上的一个默认安全启动设置，该设置允许任何操作系统镜像运行，无论其是否有错误或丢失的签名。受影响的主板超过了 290 款，包括最新的用于英特尔和 AMD CPU 的微星主板。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[我是王季思先生带的最后一届学生，从1986年秋到1996年春，我自读博士到留校，追随先生度过他人生最后的十年。如今，先生离去已将近三十年，近来读亲朋所写忆念先生的文章，恍然间觉得先生那蹒跚的身影似乎并未远去，令我有重闻謦欬的感觉。于是掇拾思绪，写下我的忆念。
一
我读博士时，先生已年过八十，但仍然写了多篇超过一万字的论文：大多是自己列出提纲，然后通过讲述，与助手、学生合作撰写。我也曾根据先生的提纲与讲述，为他整理过两篇论文。1993年，先生与郑尚宪、我合作编集《中国当代十大悲剧集》《喜剧集》《正剧集》，选目都是先生在反复征求意见之后确定的；每集都有一篇超万字的序言，虽是我和尚宪起稿，但都经过先生的悉心指导和最后审定。
年过八五之后，先生还通过口述，写了一些短篇论文。最后的两年，则是在家人和学生陪伴下，写一些随笔和回忆文字，从千余字到数千字不等。这些随笔中，我印象最深的有两篇，一篇是《我的老年心境》，另一篇是《祸福交乘  冤亲平等》。后一篇，看题目，我以为会讲“宽恕”，或是像鲁迅那样的“一个也不宽恕”，先生却说：“我感激那些信任我赞助我的同志，也不忘记那些从反面激励我前进的朋友们。”
至于诗词短章，是先生一直都在写作的。在生命的最后几年，他连口述散文也变得艰难，但每年春节也仍然自拟春联，在元旦时吟咏新篇。例如1994年的春联：
放眼东方  万里晴光来晚岁
托身南国  一生学术有传人
1995年的春联是：
薪火相传一生无大憾
中兴在望双眼盼长青
从这些春联中，可见他心心念念所想的，一是对学术的薪火相传，欣慰已得传人；二是对国家兴盛的期盼，泰然面对离去那一刻的到来。
甚至当他只能卧床，连翻身也不方便时，仍在床榻上吟咏诗句，让守护在身边的儿女记录下来，有时候也寄给朋友看，如林芷茵先生就收到过“半章”诗篇：“世味尝来惯，浮生认不真；药医不死病，佛渡有情人。”虽谈不上是华美的辞章，却依…]]></summary>

1989年2月18日至4月29日在纽约公共图书馆（NYPL）的D. Samuel和Jeane H. Gottesman展厅举办了题为“印刷中的革命：1789年的法国”的展览，以纪念法国大革命200周年。特邀策展人是普林斯顿大学教授、著名历史学家罗伯特·达恩顿（Robert Darnton）和巴黎大学教授、著名的18世纪文化史学者丹尼尔·罗什（Daniel Roche），展览的重要成果之一就是由罗伯特·达恩顿和丹尼尔·罗什主编的《印刷中的革命：1775-1800年的法国出版业》（原书名Revolution in Print: The Press in France,1775—1800，University  of California ，1989；汪珍珠译，上海教育出版社，2022年11月）。其实在主展览及专著的背后还有更多的成果，除了向走进展场的观众提供了丰富的图文观赏机会之外，还延展到在尚伯克（Schomburg）黑人文化研究中心和表演艺术研究中心的音乐和舞蹈区都举办了相关展览，一系列公共项目也开展起来，最后还与美国图书馆联合会联合在各大城市图书馆举办了巡回展。更为潜在的重要影响是激发了许多学者对大革命时期法国文化史研究的兴趣，直到今天它所激发的问题意识仍然在相关研究议题中延伸。
不妨先回到1989年世界各国纪念法国大革命二百周年的文化活动中去，或许更能理解纽约公共图书馆的这个展览所具有的独特意义。该年7月14日，在巴黎协和广场举行了盛大的大革命二百周年官方庆典活动。有学者在一个多月后认为，“协和广场上的表演，典型地说明了这场官方二百周年庆典未公开宣布的主题：‘大革命结束了。’……罗伯斯庇尔和丹东，将被…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[如果你想 在 Ubuntu 上使用终端卸载软件，可以使用：

sudo apt remove package_name


但是在很多论坛，你可能会看到别人说，如果你想彻底删除软件就用 apt purge。

你可能会觉得很困惑，因为 apt purge 和 apt remove 看起来是一样的。

sudo apt purge package_name


为什么会有两个如此像的命令来删除软件包呢？两者之间有什么不同呢？下面将为你揭晓。

apt-remove 和 apt-purge 有什么不同？

apt-remove 和 apt-purge 的相同之处就是都可以卸载软件包，但是运行 apt-purge 除了可以删除安装包之外，还可以清除相关的配置文件。这是两者之间唯一的不同点。要注意的是这两条命令都不能删除用户主目录中相关的应用程序文件。

你是否遇到过这样的情况，卸载一个软件然后重新安装，却发现之前的设置都还在。这是因为用 apt remove 不能删除该软件的相关配置文件。

哪些东西被删除了？哪些还在？

我分享一个使用 apt remove 和 apt purge 两个命令分别卸载 mplayer 这个软件的实际例子。重点是看每次操作后还残余哪些文件。

这是删除前的文件：



现在运行 apt remove 这个命令：



下面的是还残留在系统中的文件：



我们可以看到，有两个地方残留着 mplayer 的文件: /etc 和 /home/abhishek。

这次我们重新安装 mplayer，然后用 apt purge 来卸载软件。



现在让我们看看与 mplayer 相关的文件：



我们可以看到 /etc 目录下的文件已经没有了。

但是在主目录中的文件呢？apt purge 会删除它们吗？

答案是否定的。apt 命令不会删除主目录中的配置文件。所以它们仍然在系统中，除非你手动删除。但是这些文件所占的空间真的很小，几乎不占磁盘空间。

值得注意的是，不是所有的软件在主目录或者 /etc 目录下都有配置文件。

使用 apt remove 或者 apt purge 的效果

我能想到的一个实际例子就是 Discord，你用 deb 文件 在 Ubuntu 上安装了 Discord。然后登录自己的账号，之后又卸载并重新用 deb 文件安装。

现在如果你打开 Discord，你会发现你的账号自动登录了。是不是觉得很奇怪？

这是个功能，像一些软件，比如 Discord、VirtualBox，它们会提供更新，就是卸载现在的版本然后下载新的（尽管你不知道它内部怎么进行的），但是它在卸载的时候，这些软件的配置文件没有被删除，所以等你打开这些软件的时候就会自动登录。

当你想卸载一个软件，但是想保留你过去使用该软件留下的配置文件的时候，你就可以用 apt remove。

但是，有时候用它不能满足你的需求，比如当你没有配置好一个软件的时候，你想要重新开始，这个时候用 apt purge 就比较合适。

运行 apt purge 是否可以用通配符删除？

当你删除一个包的时候，它会提示 removing package-name*。这意味着它会删除以这个包名开头的所有文件。



我在手册页之类的文档中没有找到关于这个问题的答案。所以我自己做了一个小测试，我安装了 espeak 和 espeak-ng 这两个软件，espeak* 应该可以通配扩展到 espeak-ng。

但是当我用 apt purge 删除 espeak 包时，espeak-ng 包还在，没有被一并删除。因此，这似乎是有一种防止通配符的扩展的机制。

那么，你应该使用 apt remove 还是 apt purge 呢？

很少有人会一直使用 apt purge。

在我看来，一般清况下，用 apt remove 就可以了，但是当你想删除那些自定义配置文件时，你就得用 apt purge。

不管是用 apt remove 还是 apt purge，你都需要从用户的主目录中删除残余的配置文件，并运行 apt autoremove 来清除任何依赖的包。

现在到你啦。你现在对 apt remove 和 apt purge 的区别更加了解吗？你更喜欢使用哪一个呢？

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Today is y2k38 commemoration day
 I have written earlier about it, but it is worth remembering that in 15 years from now, after 2038-01-19T03:14:07 UTC, the UNIX Epoch will not fit into a signed 32-bit integer variable anymore. This will not only affect i586 and armv7 platforms, but also x86_64 where in many places 32-bit ints are used to keep track of time.
 This is not just theoretical. By setting the system clock to 2038, I found many failures in testsuites of our openSUSE packages:
  
mercurial
 tcl
 python
 mariadb
 enaml
 libarchive ... twice
 nim
 perl HTTP::Cookies
 perl Time::Moment
 python-DateTime (fixed - this one is interesting as it involved rounding errors on a floating point value)
 python-bson
 python-softlayer
 python-heatclient
 python-aiosmtplib
 python-tasklib/taskwarrior
 xemacs
  
It is also worth noting, that some code could fail before 2038, because it uses timestamps in the future. Expiry times on cookies, caches or SSL certs come to mind.
 The above list was for x86_64, but 32-bit systems are way more affected. While glibc provides some way forward for 32-bit platforms, it is not as easy as setting one flag. It needs recompilation of all binaries that use time_t.
 If there is no better way added to glibc, we would need to set a date at which 32-bit binaries are expected to use the new ABI. E.g. by 2025-01-19 we could make __TIMESIZE=64 the default. Even before that, programs could start to use __time64_t explicitly - but OTOH that could reduce portability.
 I was wondering why there is so much python in this list. Is it because we have over 3k of these in openSUSE? Is it because they tend to have more comprehensive test-suites? Or is it something else?
 The other question is: what is the best way forward for 32-bit platforms?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[On today's Fedora systems, a reboot cycle—for a kernel update,
say—is normally a fairly quick affair, but that is not always true.  The
system will 
wait for services to shut down cleanly and will wait for up to two minutes
before killing a service and moving on.  A recent proposal to change the
default timeout to 15 seconds, while still allowing some services to
require more time, ran into more opposition than was perhaps anticipated.
Not everyone was comfortable shortening the timeout period, though the
decision has now been made to reduce it, but not as far as was proposed.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello - I am wondering how many of us use some form of Linux OS as an editing workstation for either video audio or graphic design.
 At what level? Is it for home use only, or do you work professionally on a Linux workstation doing any form of media creation?
 What are some of the specific requirements for your work? What are your go-to creation applications running on Linux?
 I have been developing and using my own version of Debian for media creation over the past few years. It uses Plasma as the DE and has a bunch of now configured features to help, such as an optional real-time kernel build and coexistence of pulseaudio/JACK.
 I'm always curious to learn what others are doing with Linux, and I am hopeful that this will start a good conversation about media creation and Linux Systems... 🍻

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[1月24日，是《魔兽世界》《炉石传说》《暗黑破坏神3》《守望先锋》《星际争霸》等暴雪游戏国服预计停服的日子。此前，不少国内游戏玩家仍然期待网易与暴雪能够继续谈判，事情能够出现转机。但1月17日，暴雪中国的一则公告，彻底浇灭玩家心中最后一丝希望。公告显示，暴雪与网易不久前再次谈判未能成功，其对游戏顺延运营6个月的提议未被网易接受。


对此，1月17日晚间，网易在官微发布声明称，暴雪的这种提议是蛮横的、不得体的且不符合商业逻辑的。其过分的自信中并未考虑这种予取予求、骑驴找马、离婚不离身的行为，将玩家和网易置于了何地。


我做为一个暴雪游戏的付费玩家，对于暴雪的几乎所有游戏都有付费记录，我在后台的“交易记录”里查询，自2012年开始，有整整228条付款记录，我想我有资格对于网易和暴雪的这场“闹剧”发表一下我的看法。


我做为付费游戏玩家，我对网易和暴雪这两家公司的八卦、争端以及龌龊往事毫无兴趣，对两家公司的这场“闹剧”也毫无兴趣，我就关心我购买的游戏如何处理。游戏公司固然赚钱非常重要，但为了赚钱肆意牺牲玩家的基本权益，这样的游戏公司恐怕也长久不了。


我认为，这两家公司的商业争端，不应该损害付费玩家的利益，有些消费，例如《魔兽世界》游戏时间等，因为属于租用性质，可以无需处理，但有些消费，属于购买性质的，例如购买的数字版游戏，游戏内商品等等，应该退款给玩家。比如，我花真金白银购买的《暗黑破坏神3》，为什么就不能玩了，我花真金白银购买的《炉石传说》大量卡包，为什么就不能玩了，我花真金白银购买的《魔兽世界》大量游戏时间、游戏金币和游戏道具，为什么就不能玩了，我花真金白银购买的《守望先锋》，为什么就不能玩了。


玩家的利益是能继续玩那些已经购买的游戏，数字版游戏和光盘版游戏本质是一样的，这些游戏都是玩家的实际财产，归玩家终身所有，我做为付费玩家，我不关心网易和暴雪之间乱七八糟的事情，我向网易付费花钱购买的数字版游戏（暗黑破坏神、守望先锋等等），购买的时候没说只能玩几年，现在购买游戏不能玩了，我要求网易对这些购买商品进行退款。


我购买的数字版游戏有《暗黑破坏神3》《守望先锋》《星际争霸》等等，我购买的游戏内商品有《炉石传说》卡牌包、《炉石传说》多个冒险模式扩展包，《星际争霸》战役等等。这些都是玩家数字财产，付款给做为代理商的网易，我不管代理商和总公司有什么争执，我要求代理商履行自己的义务，要么提供玩家正常玩这些游戏的途径，要么将游戏购买的款项退给玩家。


做为一个消费者，我认为这个要求合理也合法。]]></summary>

这是一个时代的结束。正如上周报道的那样，IBM 已经将 AIX 的开发转移到印度。在它支付了 340 亿美金买下了红帽，有了自己的 FOSS 版本的 Unix 后，为什么还要为一个昂贵的美国团队支付费用来维护它自己的官方 Unix 的专有版本呢？！

自从我们报道“大蓝”推出 不支持 AIX 的新 POWER 服务器后，我们就察觉到了这一点 —— 而这已经是近八年前的事了。即使这已经是明摆的事，它也是一个重大事件。AIX 是最后一个正在积极开发的专有 Unix，在官方的 Open Group 名单 的 10 个条目中就占了 4 个。

在甲骨文公司内部，Solaris 正处于 维护模式。几乎整整六年前，我们报道了下一个主要版本 Solaris 12 已经从甲骨文的路线图上 消失 了。HPE 的 HP-UX 也处于维护模式，因为没有新的硬件可以运行它。安腾现在真的 已经死了，而最后 HP-UX 只能在这上面运行。自从我们报道惠普调查但 取消 了将其移植到 x86-64 的努力以来，已经过去了十年。

SCO Group 的最后一个化身 Xinuos 仍然存在，它提供的不是一个而是两个专有的 Unix 变体：SCO OpenServer 是 SCO Xenix 的后代，而 UnixWare 是 Novell 的 Unix 的后代。我们注意到，OpenServer 10，一个基于 FreeBSD 10 的更现代的操作系统，已经从 Xinuos 的主页上消失了。值得指出的是，SCO Group 是以前被称为 Caldera 的公司，与 1980 年代与微软 共同创建 Xenix 的 Santa Cruz Operation 不是同一个 SCO。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[苹果 AR 眼镜被无限期推迟

据报道，由于技术上的挑战，苹果公司已经无限期推迟了其轻型增强现实（AR）眼镜的推出，但仍计划在今年推出其首款混合现实（MR）头盔。MR 头盔结合了增强现实和虚拟现实（VR），将在今年的春季活动中推出，该设备的价格将在 3000 美元左右。但 Meta 的 Quest Pro 价格只有它的一半左右。


消息来源：路透社



老王点评：看来在 AR 眼镜上又一家巨头折戟了，我原本很看好苹果的 AR 眼镜。




数千 Sophos 防火墙存在严重漏洞

数千台暴露在互联网上的服务器运行的 Sophos 防火墙中存在一个严重漏洞，允许黑客执行恶意代码。它的严重性评级为 9.8/10。当 Sophos 在去年 9 月披露该漏洞时，它已经作为一个零日漏洞在野外被利用。该安全公司敦促客户安装热补丁或完整的升级。最新的研究发现，有超过 4400 台运行 Sophos 防火墙的服务器仍然存在漏洞，约占所有的 Sophos 防火墙的 6%。


消息来源：ARS Technica



老王点评：作为第一道防御措施，如果连严重漏洞都不去修补，无异于给盗贼开门。




Windows 专业版也将默认禁止访客访问

这意味着最新版本的 Windows 10、Windows Server 2019、使用 SMB2 和 SMB3 的系统将不再默认允许访客账户访问远程服务器，或允许那些提供无效凭证的人回退到访客账户。这使得 Windows 专业版与企业版和教育版中安全性保持一致，它们自 Windows 10 以来就不再允许默认访问。允许客户端使用访客登录使用户容易受到中间人攻击或恶意服务器的影响。微软称，自 Windows 2000 以来，Windows 客户端和服务器就不允许访客访问或远程用户作为访客或匿名用户连接。只有第三方远程设备可能默认需要访客访问，但运行 Windows 的系统不需要。


消息来源：The Register



老王点评：默认访客可能是方便，但在当前网络安全越来越重要的形式下，显然是个严重的安全缺陷。]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Vim 很不错，但 NeoVim 更新一些，甚至更棒。Vim 和 NeoVim 都是基于终端的文本编辑器，具有类似的功能。

如果你是一个习惯于使用 像 VS Code 这样的 GUI 文本编辑器 的人，并且希望拥有 NeoVim 提供的类似功能，你应该了解一下这些 GUI 编辑器。

虽然我知道你可以把 NeoVim 作为你目前的文本编辑器的插件，但直接使用 NeoVim 工作要比管理插件更有效和方便。

在选择 NeoVim 的 GUI 时，有一些不同的选择，我把一些最好的 GUI 列在下面：

1、Neovide



主要特点：


动画光标

平滑滚动

动画窗口

模糊的浮动窗口

支持表情符号


Neovide 旨在成为一个简单的 NeoVim GUI。

虽然你不会看到很多图形元素，它只是增加了一些诸如动画之类的 GUI 功能。它使用了一个叫 Skulpin 的库来渲染动画。

而我在使用 Neovide 时最喜欢的地方是它拥有一个动画光标和平滑滚动。你看一看这个就明白了：



看起来很酷。对吗？

2、Neovim Qt



主要特点：


悬停功能

多个 GUI 标签

自动制表符补完

跨平台支持


顾名思义，Neovim Qt 是用 Qt5 库构建的，你会经常看到它在 KDE 中使用。它没有太多花哨的东西，只是增加了一些额外的 GUI 功能，如多个标签，自动制表符补完等。

因此，如果你已经在使用 Qt5 库，并希望为 NeoVim 提供一个精简的 GUI，它将工作的很好，并为你省去一些依赖安装。

推荐：


Vim vs Nano：你应该选择哪个？


3、Uivonim



主要特点：


WebGL GPU 渲染和多线程

支持 VSCode 扩展

Nyancat（经典猫咪动画的 ANSI 文本程序）

悬停和代码动作


Uivonim 是 Veonim（一个建立在 VSCode 插件和 NeoVim 上的简单 IDE）的复刻版，采用 Electron 框架编写，如果你从 VSCode 转换过来，它是一个完美的选择。

而 Uivonim 的唯一目标是提供丰富的 NeoVim 体验，支持 NeoVim 的最新功能，包括浮动窗口、内置 LSP 等等。你不需要依赖 VSCode 扩展来获得这些功能。

4、FVim



主要特点：


脱离窗口（使用 Ctrl+w，GE）

自定义弹出式菜单条目图标

支持 HiDPI

GPU 加速


FVim 是一个用 F# + Avalonia 构建的 NeoVim 的跨平台 GUI，带有一些突破性的功能，如高性能渲染（在 4K 显示器上支持 60FPS）。

而我经常使用脱离窗口的功能，因为我更喜欢为不同的文本文件设置独立的窗口。另外，如果你是一个资深的远程用户，FVim 也不会让你失望。

5、Goneovim



主要特点：


支持一个带有 Bash 和 Zsh 的终端

迷你地图

动画光标

HiDPI 缩放

外部浮动窗口


顾名思义，Goneovim 是用 Go 语言编写的，是 Gonvim 的一个复刻品。它提供了足够的 GUI 功能来完成你的工作，如动画光标、像素级滚动等。

而且它在让你获得基本的文本编辑功能方面也并不差，比如对文本文件的拖放支持。

总结

这是我对 NeoVim 的图形用户界面的一些好的选择，我希望你能找到你想要的东西。

如果我错过了任何你喜欢的东西，请在评论中告诉我。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[《动员的力量：上海学潮的起源》，陈以爱著，民国历史文化学社2021年10月版

布罗代尔尝言：“事件”犹如夜空滑过的一束烟花，虽然耀目一时，却也转瞬成空，真正掌握历史面貌的乃是那些“不变或几乎不变”的“结构”。在刹那爆发之后，“事件”仍要跌回“结构”的沉沉暗夜中——然而大多数史家智若孩童，喜欢被瞬间光华吸引，反倒错过了历史的真正主人，这令他颇感遗憾。布罗代尔诚然是伟大的，可是伟人的发言，即使是最为得意的主张，也未必可以句句着实，让人信以为真。事件的确是突发的、瞬时的，却并不因此就只是消极的力量，而无法产生深远和实质性的影响。事实上，如果一个事件不断引来学者重访，那必然蕴含着极为丰富的意义潜能，绝非短暂的幻相所能涵盖。这样的“事件”，自然不是布罗代尔心中（地理性和生态性的）“结构”，但它一定是其来有自，在突发的表象下，隐藏着更加绵长的线索，也因此能对后续历史产生更为持久的影响，其于历史研究的重要性，未必比“结构”来得轻。
五四运动就是这样的“事件”之一。自其发生以来，百余年中，论者因立场不同，下笔各异其趣，却无不试图把握对此事件的解释权，借由叙说过去以干预未来。然而奇怪的是，对于这样一个开辟性的历史事件，真正有分量的史学著作却相当罕见。周策纵先生的《五四运动：现代中国的思想革命》问世已超过一个甲子，仍是这一领域无法绕过的巅峰；彭明先生的《五四运动史》则带有过于鲜明的政治取向，而出版也已二十余年。不过，最近十余年来，学界对此一事件兴趣大增，许多事实得到清理，观察视角也更趋多元，极大地刷新了学界的认知。陈以爱教授最近推出的《动员的力量：上海学潮的起源》一书，可以看作这些新的学术努力的代表性成就。
作为作者计划中“东南集团与五四研究系列”三部曲中的第一部，本书厚达六百余页，其内容之丰富，亦足与外观相副。此书聚焦1919年的上海学运，看来并不算开创性的题目，但实际上这是一个似乎人人略…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[如果你想调试或排除任何问题，你需要一个像 lnav 这样的高级日志文件查看器。它在任何 Linux 系统的终端都能创造奇迹。


lnav: 日志文件查看器

lnav 可以即时解压缩所有的压缩日志文件，并将它们合并在一起进行漂亮的显示。显示是根据错误/警告的类型进行解析和格式化的，这有助于快速浏览成千上万的日志，特别是在服务器中。

在分析日志的时候，时间戳是非常重要的。所以 lnav 会根据时间戳合并多个日志，这对追踪系统问题很有帮助。

大多数重要的日志文件格式检测都是内置的，包括如下：


通用网络访问日志Common Web Access Log格式

CUPS page_log

Syslog

Glog

VMware ESXi/vCenter 日志

dpkg.log

uwsgi

“通用”：任何以时间戳开头的信息

Strace

sudo

GZIP、BZIP


这还不是全部，lnav 还能实现以下功能，使其成为 Linux 系统的重要应用：


根据正则表达式过滤消息

错误日志的时间轴视图

漂亮的打印视图，这有助于重新格式化

使用 SQL 查询日志

在搜索时，日志会实时更新

通过正则表达式高亮显示语法（比如你想在整个日志中找出一个 IP 地址）

显示的日志中任何单词的 Tab 补全！!




要查看上述功能的截图和了解更多信息，请访问 本页面 。

如何安装

这个程序在 Ubuntu、Debian 的官方仓库中可以找到。使用以下命令安装它。

sudo apt install lnav


而对于 Fedora、RHEL 用户，使用下面的命令：

sudo dnf install lnav


另外，开发者还提供了一个离线的独立可执行文件，你不需要安装。你可以从 GitHub 发布页 下载压缩包，然后按以下方式执行：

./lnav


注意：它也可用于 macOS，你可以在上述 GitHub 页面找到。

lnav: 如何使用（基础）

简单的命令语法是：

lnav [options] [logfile1 logfile2 …]


如果你直接运行 lnav 命令，它会显示你系统中的所有日志（/var/log/messages 和 /var/log/syslog)

lnav


要查看任何特定的日志文件，在命令行中输入：

lnav /var/log/syslog


使用 -t 参数在你的日志输出中添加时间戳：

lnav -t /var/log/syslog


以下是 lnav 的一些关键开关：


-d file：将调试信息写入给定的文件。

-a：加载所有最新的日志文件类型。

-r：也加载较早的轮转的日志文件。

-t：在标准输入中读入的数据行上预加时间戳。

-w file：将标准输入的内容写入该文件。

-c cmd：在文件加载后执行命令。

-f path：执行给定文件中的命令。

-n：不使用 curses UI 运行（无头模式）。




要进一步阅读和探索，请访问 官方文档。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Because LTS distros ship with outdated kernels and drivers, they typically don’t support the latest hardware. 
 If distros want to market their so-called stable releases as the go-to option for most users, it should come with massive disclaimers that they are shipping 2 year old mesa and any GPU newer than that is gonna cause issues. 
 Same applies to wifi in laptops or even CPUs in extreme cases. 
 This post was inspired by having to yet again help a friend troubleshoot why his brand new GPU wasn’t working in Ubuntu.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[You may like or dislike Tiktok based on it's content and style of delivering that content but I think everyone has to admit that technically it is quite the achievement.
It's video based and delivers video really well. It rarely buffers or fails to load. Compare that to the Reddit video player or the Twitter video player or Vimeo. It's much better. Netflix loads poorly initially for me quite a bit (granted it's trying to load much higher quality).
How did they manage to get the engineering talent when seemingly FB, MS, Netflix, Amazon, Google are all fighting for that talent?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[周二晚间，网易就暴雪中国官方微博《暴雪对国服玩家社区的更新说明》中一些消息直引发了市场和媒体的诸多评论，发布声明进行回应，网易称上周暴雪公司重新寻求网易公司，提出了所谓的游戏服务顺延六个月的提议和其他条件，并明确表示在合同延续期间不会停止与其他潜在合作方继续谈判。网易称，据其了解，同期暴雪与其他公司的谈判全部是基于三年的合同期。考虑到合作的不对等、不公平和其他附带条件，因此最终双方未能达成一致。


网易还就网传寻求暴雪游戏或其他合作伙伴的IP控制权也发表回应。网易表示，作为代理公司，网易从未寻求暴雪游戏或其他合作伙伴的IP控制权，在过去十四年的长期合作过程中，网易对任何暴雪IP的使用和授权都是按照合同条款，并取得了暴雪的同意和审批。与其他合作伙伴的IP合作也都是基于此原则。


网易声明全文如下：



网易公司就《暴雪对国服玩家社区的更新说明》的说明


今天，暴雪中国通过其官方微博发表了《暴雪对国服玩家社区的更新说明》，其中一些消息直指网易，且因此内容，引发了市场和媒体的诸多非议，我方特说明如下。


一、关于“网易拒绝关于暴雪提议的顺延服务六个月”的说明。


美国动视暴雪公司于北京时间2022年11月17日发布公告称，将中止上海网之易公司代理的暴雪游戏在中国大陆地区的服务，生效时间为2023年1月24日0时。


暴雪中国公司于今天（2023年1月17日）发布最新声明表示，这期间暴雪方面已经启动了寻找新合作方的工作。基于未可知的原因，上周暴雪公司重新寻求网易公司，提出了所谓的游戏服务顺延六个月的提议和其他条件，并明确表示在合同延续期间不会停止与其他潜在合作方继续谈判。而据我们了解，同期暴雪与其他公司的谈判全部是基于三年的合同期。考虑到合作的不对等、不公平和其他附带条件，因此最终双方未能达成一致。


我方认为，暴雪的这种提议——包括今天突发的声明——是蛮横的、不得体的且不符合商业逻辑的。其过分的自信中并未考虑这种予取予求、骑驴找马、离婚不离身的行为，将玩家和网易置于了何地。


二、关于有媒体报道“网易想要IP控制权”的说法说明。


我们关注到，有媒体收到爆料称网易想要暴雪IP控制权的传闻。在此，我们必须严肃指正：作为代理公司，网易从未寻求暴雪游戏或其他合作伙伴的IP控制权，在过去十四年的长期合作过程中，网易对任何暴雪IP的使用和授权都是按照合同条款，并取得了暴雪的同意和审批。与其他合作伙伴的IP合作也都是基于此原则。


三、关于《魔兽世界》游戏玩家进度存档的提示。


对于暴雪中国在其声明中提到的关于明天（北京时间2023年1月18日）推出的《魔兽世界》游戏进度存档功能，我们有义务提醒所有玩家，该功能为暴雪单方面提出并开发上线，未经网易方面测试、使用，可能存在未知安全隐患。若因此功能造成玩家虚拟财产损失或无法游戏，暴雪方面应承担全部责任。


说明如上，承诺如下：


当告别注定成为故事的终章，网易也还是希望尽最大努力，陪玩家走完最后的时光，为玩家服务到最后一刻。从此以后，无论你身处何方，无论你要去向何处，愿风指引你的道路，愿星辰照亮你前进的方向。]]></summary>

The reasoning was mostly because of how Plymouth's handling of keyboard input was reliant on VTs, and not the input devices themselves. However, the next version of Plymouth will now fix this. 
 Thanks to the work of /u/diegovsky_pvp and halfline and me, Plymouth now will use evdev keyboard input and xkbcommon keymappings instead, in the same way a modern and major display servers handle keyboard input. I also made a small tweak so that Plymouth can be forced to not fallback to serial console output when the kernel console is something like ttyS0, (which is the default on kernels compiled without VTs). However, for compatibility with serial logging, it will require …]]></summary>

大部分机器学习软件开发框架严重依赖于英伟达 CUDA，并在英伟达 GPU 上表现最佳。但随着 PyTorch 2.0 和 OpenAI Triton 的到来，英伟达 CUDA 对机器学习的垄断地位正逐渐瓦解。即将到来的 PyTorch 2.0 在英伟达 A100 上的训练性能提升了 86%，在 CPU 上的推理性能提升了 26%。而且这种优势可以扩展到 AMD、英特尔、特斯拉、谷歌、亚马逊、微软等等各个公司生产的 GPU 和 AI 加速器上。而 Triton 能让高级语言达到与使用低级语言相当的性能，提高了可用性。

Basecamp 因巨额账单退出云计算

Basecamp 的 CTO，也是 Ruby On Rails 的创建者 DHH 介绍了让该公司退出云计算的巨额账单。其 2022 年的费用为 320 万美元，绝大部分都花在了 AWS 上，其中 S3 花费 90 万美元，RDS 47 万美元，OpenSearch 52 万美元，Elasticache 12 万美元。即便如此，也是经过大量工作才减少到这一费用的，该团队不但运行了成本检查计划，还就作为私人协议就长期使用达成了协议。DHH 还用戴尔服务器的三年均摊成本做了对比。

老王点评：云计算确实有很多好处，但也可能是个让你花钱上瘾的无底洞。




使用了 25 年的笔记本内存规范 SO-DIMM 将被替换

制定内存标准的组织 JEDEC 正在制定新规范，以取代已经使用了 25 年的 SO-DIMM 规范。新的 CAMM 标准将基于戴尔公司的设计，目标是在 2023 年下半年完成 1.0 规范，到明年推出基于 CAMM 的系统。现有的 SO-DIMM 在 DDR5/6400 时已经遇到了“困境”，CAMM 的主要吸引力在于它可以实现更高的内存密度，同时还可以扩展到更高的时钟速度。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[据暴雪中国发布说明消息，对暴雪娱乐在国服地区的游戏服务状况作出说明。暴雪中国表示，其上周再次与网易接触并寻求协助，以探讨将现有的，基于网易于2019年已同意既定条款的协议，顺延六个月，从而使大家得以不受干扰地继续游戏，也让暴雪继续探寻未来在国服地区合理而长远的发展道路。但网易并未在上周的顺延谈判后，接受其关于顺延现有游戏服务协议的提议。因此暴雪将遵照网之易停服公告于1月23日中止国服游戏服务。


以下为暴雪中国的公告全文：



暴雪对国服玩家社区的更新说明


亲爱的国服玩家们：


我们想通过今天这封信，对暴雪娱乐在国服地区的游戏服务状况向大家做一些说明。


我们明白，自从网易的相关公告发布以来，这段时间大家都很煎熬，而我们自己也深感忧虑。我们永远都把玩家放在第一位，无论各位来自世界的哪个角落。大家对未来的不确定感，也让我们这些已服务国服玩家社区20年的暴雪同事们感到很痛苦。


许多暴雪的同事都是游戏玩家。我们通过电子游戏结识了许多终生挚友，收获了许多珍贵回忆。这些游戏空间对我们来说意义重大，让我们能尽情享受乐趣，成为一个热爱暴雪游戏的玩家。我们非常理解游戏对人们有多重要。许多国服玩家也发来消息和邮件分享你们的感受，你们不能玩到最喜欢游戏的痛苦，你们与暴雪游戏、乃至暴雪早期经典游戏的共同成长经历，你们从那时起就一直是暴雪游戏的玩家。每封邮件读来都让我们唏嘘感叹。


正是出于我们作为游戏玩家的个人体会，以及国服玩家向我们所表达的憾恼，我们上周再次与网易接触并寻求协助，以探讨将现有的，基于网易于2019年已同意既定条款的协议，顺延六个月，从而使大家得以不受干扰地继续游戏，也让暴雪继续深寻未来在国服地区合理而长远的发展道路不幸的是，网易井未在上周的顺延谈判后，接受我们关于顺延现有游戏服务协议的提议。因此我们将不得不遵照网之易停服公告于1月23日中止国服游戏服务。


鉴于这个不幸的结果，我们想重申我们对国服玩家的承诺，同时与大家分享目前我们所能提供的最新消息：


关于玩家游戏进度存档：


妥善封存大家的游戏进度、物品装备和美好回忆，对于暴雪的每位同事而言，都至关重要一一我们创造这些世界，是为了让各位感觉到自己是其中的一部分。我们希望各位能够从先前离开的地方继续前进。我们希望网易能遵照其此前发布的停服公告，妥善封存所有玩家的游戏数据。


为了让《魔兽世界》的国服玩家多一份安心，在网之易所提供的游戏数据封存之外，暴雪也会在明天（北京时间1月18日)推出一项功能，让《魔兽世界》的国服玩家下各自的游戏进度以备未来使用。将来国服游戏重新上饯时，大家就可以上传手中保存的游戏历史，以便继续游戏。这项功能将持续开通至国服停服。我们后续也将在微博与大家分享更多关于《魔兽世界》进度存档的信息。


关于退款：


正如网之易此前在2022年11月17日发布的公告中提到的，针对玩家在游戏内已充值但未消耗的网络游戏虚拟货币以及付费购买且仍未生效的游戏时间（如有），我们预期网之易会在稍后开通退款申请渠道，详情请关注网之易方面的退款相关信息发布。


关于导找新合作方的进展：


我们已与多个与我们一样拥有玩家为先价值现的潜在合作方展开了会谈。我们会优先选择这样的潜在合作伙件:能为玩家提供高质量且稳定的游戏服务，能在游戏内外营造积极的游戏环境，而且能和我们一起尽力将我们的游戏带回给国服玩家。我们将在未来与大家分享新的进展。


遗憾的是，网易不愿在我们寻找一家新合作方期间，基于现有的合作条款将游戏服务顺延六个月，使大家在这段时间能继续游戏。但我们不会因此放弃，仍会为大家竭尽全力。我们希望大家明白，事情仍未结束。我们仍会努力寻找怀揣共同信仰的国服合作伙伴。


我们目前及今后都会尽我们所能地与大家分享相关进展。


感谢读到这里的各位，也希望大家理解，无论是在即将到来的兔年还是将来，我们和每一位暴雪同仁，对各位国服玩家的心意，都不会改变，]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Linux 内核将不再支持 RNDIS 驱动程序。这是一个好的举措吗？这对你意味着什么？在这里了解一下。




微软的 RNDIS 协议（即 远程网络驱动接口规范Remote Network Driver Interface Specification 的简称），是一个专有的 USB 协议，用于计算机上的虚拟以太网功能。

这方面最常见的使用情况是通过连接到电脑上的 USB，使用手机的移动网络连接互联网，也称为 系连Tethering。

尽管它主要在 Windows 上工作，但它成为 Linux 内核的一部分已经有一段时间了。

但这种情况很快就会改变。

向 RNDIS 协议说再见？



发生了什么？ 周一，Greg Kroah-Hartman 创建了 usb.git rndis-removal 分支，其中他提到禁用 Linux 上所有 RNDIS 协议驱动程序的实现。

在该提交中他提到：


微软的 RNDIS 协议按照设计是不安全的，在任何连接不信任的主机或设备的系统上使用它都是脆弱的。因为该协议不可能变得安全，所以只要禁用所有的 RNDIS 驱动，就可以防止任何人再使用它们。Windows 只在 XP 和更新一些的系统中需要用它，比这更早的 Windows 系统可以使用正常的 USB 类协议来代替，没有这些问题。


正如最初由 Phoronix 报道的那样，一旦这个协议在 Kconfig 选项中被标记为 “损坏”，它将再保留一段时间，最终从内核中删除。

但是为什么呢？

众所周知，RNDIS 在 Windows 之外的平台上的实现是一团糟，并带来了相当多的安全风险。此外，RNDIS 并不像以前那样广泛使用了，它带来的安全风险可能是作出这一决定的主要原因之一。

这对目前的用户有影响吗？你应该担心吗？

如果我们看一下对这一即将到来的变化的 Reddit 讨论，我们会发现许多用户仍然很担心这是否会破坏大家的 USB 连接。

考虑到许多安卓手机仍然使用 RNDIS 而不是 CDC NCM（一种较新的协议），用户似乎对这一举措感到困惑 😕；不只是用户，一位 谷歌的内核网络开发人员 也提出了这个议题，但我们还没有看到对此的回应。

但不是每个人都使用主线 Linux 内核？如果你不想受到这种变化的影响，你是否应该坚持使用 LTS 版本的内核？

此外，用户希望更清楚地了解这是否会影响到所有人。

但是，从目前来看，Greg 可能并没有给出更多的细节来说服一些相关用户。

🤔 当然，我们不是 Linux 内核维护者。所以，最好等这个提交通过时，我希望 Linux 内核维护者能比我们知道更多的信息。

💭 你对这个计划中的 Linux 内核的变化有什么看法？请在下面的评论中分享你的想法。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[《女士接力: 美国变革者》，钱满素著，青豆书坊｜上海社会科学院出版社2022年5月出版，352页，68.00元

2022年6月24日，美国最高法院一份反堕胎的判决引发全美抗议，令全世界关心女性权益的人感到忧心。最高法院门前抗议的人群中，有个女孩举着牌子，写着“我享有的权利还没有奶奶享有的权利多”，诉说着女性权利的退步。

希拉里·克林顿

即便是在现代文明国家，女性享有与男性大致相等的权利，也不过是近几十年的事情。2018年初夏，希拉里·克林顿回到母校耶鲁大学，在“毕业纪念日”上发表演讲时，开篇回顾了1969年她初到耶鲁法学院读书时的场景。那年，耶鲁法学院两百三十五名新生中只有二十七名女生，耶鲁本科生院第一次招收女生。四年后，《纽约时报》针对耶鲁男女同校的调查显示，“女生比男生更加努力，并或多或少取得了更高的成绩”。但令希拉里感到震惊的是，这份调查还显示，上述结果竟让许多男性觉得受到了威胁。
纵然性别平权还有很长的路要走，但今天的成绩耗费了无数人的心血，是一代代人接力实现的成就。钱满素先生组织编写的《女士接力：美国变革者》（除特别注明外，本文注释均出自本书）讲述了美国历史上跨越百年的九位最重要的杰出女性。她们为今天的男女平等贡献了心智，做出了表率，争得了机会，留下了成绩。一部书稿，九位人物，九份传记，九段历史，诉说着同一个主题：追求男女平权。这九位女士，不仅自己活出了精彩的人生，成为每一个追求独立者的典范，更带领着后继者完成这场接力赛，争取缔造一个男女平权的社会。
一
像大多数成功者一样，这九位女士生性“另类”，思想和行动都处在时代前列，因此并不受所处的时代待见。她们中有些人的遭遇在今天看来已不可思议。生于十七世纪的安·哈钦森，遭受审判的主要罪行是，身为女人在家聚众讨论宗教问题。当时的北美大陆是上帝抛弃欧洲旧世界而临在的新世界，是“山巅之城”，因宗教自由成为欧洲异端的圣地…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've created a GitHub Action for running commands on multiple platforms. This includes platforms that GitHub Actions don't natively support. It currently supports FreeBSD, OpenBSD and NetBSD. OpenBSD can run on x86-64 and ARM64, the other operating systems run on x86-64.
Some of the features that are supported include:
* Multiple operating system with one single action
* Multiple versions of each operating system
* Allows to use default shell or Bash shell
* Low boot overhead
* Fast execution
* Runs on both macOS and Linux runners
Compared to similar solutions like https://github.com/vmactions/freebsd-vm, the boot time is around a fifth and the full execution time for the same job is around half of freebsd-vm (last time I tried).
The readme contains more information about how it all works under the hood.

current systems and hopes for gains that exceed that loss in the future —

	With flent - in the 110 tests in it - in a matter of minutes you

	networking results across an extraordinary number of variables,
	over time, across many tests. Before Toke Høiland-Jørgensen
	developed flent, it would take days to set up a single test and

	each change you make, with comparable results in a standardized

I’m excited to share sketch: a tool to help anyone who uses python and pandas quickly iterate and get to answers for their data questions.
Sketch installs as a pandas extension that offers utility functions that operate on natural language prompts. Using the `ask` interface you can get answers in natural language. Using the `howto` interface you can get get python and pandas code directly. The primary benefit of this over copilot and chatGPT is that this adds data-content based context so that the generated answers are much more accurate and relevant to the data problem at hand.
Check out the demo video[1] and try it out using the colab notebook (on github)!

科技新闻网站 CNET 被发现自去年 11 月以来，用 AI 撰写了 75 篇与个人财务有关的文章，但这些文章并没有申明使用 AI 撰写。CNET 回应 称，虽然 AI 撰写了这些文章内容和收集了素材，但发表的每一篇文章都经过了具有相关专业知识的编辑的审查、事实核查和编辑。CNET 随后注明了这些文章由 AI 撰写。他们称正在做其最擅长的事情：测试一项新技术，以便能够将炒作与现实分开。有趣的是，BussFeed 在报道此事时，也使用 ChatGPT 来撰写了整篇报道，但经过编辑审核后，“不得不重写了几次提示，以使其不再插入事实错误”。

Linux 准备禁用微软的 RNDIS 协议的驱动程序

RNDIS 是通过 USB 提供虚拟以太网功能的专有协议，但除了 Windows 之外，几乎没有得到支持。由于安全问题，Linux 内核正在准备将 RNDIS 内核驱动程序移到 Kconfig “损坏” 选项里，一旦被标记为 “损坏” 一段时间，这些驱动将可能最终从上游源码树中删除。内核维护者 Greg 表示 “因为该协议不可能做到安全，所以禁用所有 RNDIS 驱动，以防止任何人再使用它们”。

老王点评：按 Linux 的风格，这么不安全的协议是怎么进入内核的？

That is, creating m3u playlists, finding music using the file manager, creating mixes and the rest.

So, with a bit of guidance from ChatGPT, I made a shell script that takes the battery level of a connected DualSense controller and outputs it on the tray via the xfce4-genmon plugin. It also powers off the controller when you click on the battery percentage number. 
 My setup is for 2 controllers with active/inactive icons and battery % text, but you can easily customize it for your needs.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Linux Mint 是我最喜欢的发行版之一，其旗舰版的默认 Cinnamon 桌面是我如此喜欢它的原因。


Cinnamon 桌面提供的用户体验可能并不炫目花哨。但是，用户有充分的理由喜欢这个桌面环境，并可以轻松地用它来完成工作。

在日复一日工作中，我们想要的是，一个能按预期工作且不造成妨碍的用户界面。

我认为 Cinnamon 桌面做对了几件事，可以给你带来了令人兴奋的体验。让我在这里介绍其中一些。


如果你还不知道，Cinnamon 桌面是由 Linux Mint 的创建者 Clement Lefebvre 于 2011 年创建的 GNOME 3 复刻版，并经过多年的改进。


1、熟悉的用户界面



构建 Cinnamon 的主要目的是为了保持 GNOME 2 的桌面风格。

而这就是为什么与最流行的消费级桌面操作系统 Windows 相比，你会看到一个熟悉的桌面布局。

当然，随着时间的推移，Windows 11 已经进化了它的通常布局。但是，访问开始菜单、任务栏、托盘中的系统图标和几个窗口装饰使其易于掌握。

无论你是 Windows 用户还是 macOS 用户，Cinnamon 的桌面布局都不应该让你感到有什么挑战。



为了进一步帮助你，Linux Mint 的 “欢迎屏幕” 为你迅速提供了各种信息。

2、轻量级

为了获得舒适的 Cinnamon 桌面体验（通常使用 Linux Mint），有以下最低系统要求：


4GB 内存

100 GB 的磁盘空间

1024×768 分辨率的屏幕


在现代计算时代，这些规格应该适合几乎所有人。所以，你不必担心需要一个疯狂的内存或磁盘空间来运行由 Cinnamon 驱动的 Linux 发行版。

当然，你可以尝试 在 Ubuntu 上安装 Cinnam…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[开源论坛软件 Discourse 有了一个新的重大版本升级！让我们看看有什么新东西。




Discourse 是一个开源的论坛平台，以其丰富的功能和第三方集成而闻名。

它也是 最好的开源论坛软件 之一，你可以部署在你的 Linux 服务器上来建立一个社区。

现在，我们来看看 Discourse 的最新版本。

在 Discourse 2.0 发布已近五年之后，Discourse 3.0 终于来了。

这个版本包含了大量的新功能和改进，让我带你看看：

🆕 Discourse 3.0 的新变化



Discourse 3.0 提供了很多东西，其中一些值得注意的亮点包括：


新的设置向导

用户状态

通知菜单

新的侧边栏

实时聊天

用户提示


新的设置向导



Discourse 现在有一个新的设置向导，可以让你快速配置一些最重要的选项。

因此，像将社区设置为私人、仅邀请、需要批准等选项在论坛设置的初始阶段就会显示出来。

用户状态



与现在大多数社区平台的做法类似，Discourse 现在也支持设置用户状态。

用户可以设置一个自定义的表情符号和文字，在整个平台上显示在他们的头像附近，无论是帖子、聊天还是用户卡中。

通知菜单



这终于实现了。

Discourse 现在有一个专门的通知菜单，让你更容易跟踪你在论坛上的活动。

新的侧边栏



这是的另一项你可能会喜欢的用户体验改进。

你现在可以在新的侧边栏上添加聊天频道、标签和类别，以方便访问你想追踪的东西。

论坛的管理员也可以为游客和新成员设置一个默认的侧边栏配置；这样，每个人都可以对论坛提供的内容有一个很好的展望。

实时聊天



Discourse 现在支持实时聊天；频道管理员可以选择创建一个非正式的讨论、展示，甚至是备忘录的空间，如果这对他们有用的话。

Discourse 的产品经理 Rishabh Nambiar 提到：


我们的目标是，当对话在快节奏的聊天和慢节奏的讨论之间转换时，赋予社区以综合的体验。

当想法被激发出来，在一个更容易被发现的地方，聊天信息可以被引用到话题中，讨论可以随着时间的推移而继续，并允许不同时间和地点的人以后加入进来。


用户提示



这个功能对不熟悉 Discourse 的新用户很有帮助。

当用户第一次使用某个特定的功能时，他们会得到与 Discourse 的功能相关的提示。

🛠️ 其他变化和改进

上面提到的并不是这次发布的 Discourse 的全部变化，下面是其他一些亮点：


改造了标签系统。

改进了搜索界面。

更新了开源工具。

改进了错误页面。

新的闪屏。

改进了页面加载动画。

更快的图像预加载。


如果你想深入了解这个版本的技术细节，请查阅 发行说明。

📥 获取 Discourse 3.0

如果你使用的是 Discourse 的托管计划，你一定已经收到了 3.0 的更新，你所要做的就是通过你的管理设置启用新功能。

如果你是自我托管，你必须通过点击管理仪表板上的“更新”按钮手动更新你的实例。

对于新用户，请在他们的官方网站上探索更多关于 Discourse 的信息。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[《溪山清远：中国古代早期绘画史（先秦至宋）》，[美]高居翰著，张坚等译，北京大学出版社，2022年10月出版，840页，398.00元

在众多中国读者眼中，高居翰（James Cahill，1926-2014）或许是中国绘画领域最为名声卓著的海外研究者，被称为“最懂中国画的美国人”。他在中国巨大的影响力，有相当一部分来自他数量庞大的著作。2009至2022年间，三联书店曾将高居翰的八本著作密集而系统地引进中国大陆。2023年开年，高居翰重回众人视野，一部厚达八百二十页的巨帙作品《溪山清远：中国古代早期绘画史（先秦至宋）》由北京大学出版社出版。
本书开篇提及，高居翰去世前曾对自己未能写出一本中国美术通史而深感遗憾。但他当时年事已高，无力再撰写规模宏大的通史著作，所以才选择了录制视频这个相对简单的形式。《溪山清远》一书正是由高居翰晚年录制的系列讲座“A Pure and Remote View: Visualizing Early Chinese Landscape Painting”翻译、整理而来。所以准确地说，这并不是一本严肃的学术著作，而是高居翰引导读者学习如何“观画”的指南书，带领读者“云看展”的观画秘笈。也正是因为如此，众人难得见到了一个更为真性情的大师。
在开篇的“导言”中，高居翰就极其郑重地提出了要求：“听我讲的时候，请不要费心做笔记。……仔细观看才是我真正想让大家去做的事情。”他认为，“作品不会说话，画家也不用凝重和严肃的术语，一切都在画里发生着”。高居翰最想让中国艺术研究领域里的年轻学者铭记于心的，就是“要长时间观察和分析艺术作品，把注意力放在视觉特质上”。他认为，眼睛是用来观看艺术品的，而不是用来阅读文献的；美术史研究应以画面图像，而不是文本话语为核心。观画，要重视看画面本身，题跋印章和画面背后的笔法传统及历史典故，远不如观看本身重要。

 Recently I decided to see how far Ubuntu has came over the last decade or so since I tried it, and it seems to have fell off a cliff. I could go over issue after issue I have with it, but I'm sure some of you just know what I mean. Ubuntu used to be the flagship Linux distro. What happened?

 Does anybody know? 
 The readme says he can ship the source files on 3'5" disks. I found that a bit amusing today.

        <link href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34392783"/>
        <updated>2023-01-15T20:07:48.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Last month I asked[0] what could be done with an old iPad; the responses led me to discover Alfred Home Security[0] and It's exactly what I was looking for. The winning feature being, you can repurpose any old iOS device as a camera.
I have since used the app with 2 old iPads, and an iPhone 7 Plus. Works better than I expect, really nicely done app.
The motion detection is spot-on. I've been mostly using this to see what our new very shy kitten is up to since we've only seen him twice in 5 weeks; basically he's impossible to find during the day and only comes out to play after we're asleep. The videos are super fun / cute, and it's nice to see he's having fun and in good health! [3]
Alfred Security also make a impressive, very inexpensive camera ($34 US, 1080P, night vision, 130 degree viewing angle and easy to mount). I just received 3 of the 4.
TLDR: last month I wanted to know what was the best use for old iPads /iOS devices, and I've since discovered Alfred Home Security[1].
Supported Devices[2]:
Android: Android 4.4 or above (For a better experience, operating systems above Android 5 are highly recommended)
iOS: iOS 10 or above

[3] https://alfred.camera/tv/9IHo74Mj5
* I have nothing to do, nor any affiliation with Alfred other than pay for and use their products.
* Original Post is locked; I couldn't post this information there.
* Updated with devices / link, and kitty video link (this is off an old iPad, not the Alfred Camera), and formatting.

	There is very little left to do before version 3.0 can be

Copilot 实验室的 VS 扩展中“添加了一个笔刷工具箱，可以修改你的代码，只要选择几行，再选择你的笔刷，就能看到你的代码更新了。”他们演示了添加类型笔刷、修复错误笔刷、添加调试笔刷、易读性笔刷等。并且以后会增加更多笔刷，允许开发人员存储自定义笔刷。他们的目的是“如何赋予开发者权力，而不是使他们自动化”，最终是将一个令人难以置信的简单界面嫁接到 “由机器学习驱动的代码修改” 上。目前该笔刷工具箱的订阅费用是每月 10 美元。




消息来源：GitHub Next



老王点评：我有个脑洞啊 —— 以后或许可以选择“卡马克”笔刷，就可以写出像大神一样的代码了。




Ubuntu 的实时内核接近普遍可用状态

在 Ubuntu 22.04 LTS 中，Canonical 提供了一个测试版的实时内核。一年后，Canonical 宣布带有实时内核的 Ubuntu 接近普遍可用（GA）。而且，它目前仍然是 Ubuntu Pro/Ubuntu Advantage 组合的一部分，这至少对个人使用是免费的。此外，上游的实时补丁系列几乎已经完全就绪，只剩下一些不大的问题了。如果今年实时内核支持进入了 Linux 内核主线，将使 Linux 发行版更容易提供实时内核。


消息来源：Phoronix



老王点评：通过整个社区的各家企业和开发者的努力，Linux 的实时内核终于就快完成了，这对 Linux 的应用场景拓展很有意义。




大量第三方 Twitter 应用停止工作

众多第三方 Twitter 客户端在周四晚上停止工作，目前还不知道是什么原因，Twitter 官方并没有给出解释。“因为新的所有者取消了致力于保持 API 顺利运行的员工，包括之前提供与第三方沟通的开发者布道师”。现在访问这些客户端使用的 API 会返回 “401 未授权” 的错误。据推测，访问受限的原因可能是在这些第三方客户端上的广告被过滤、推文按时间排序而不是按更容易挣钱的算法排序，也有可能是使用这些第三方客户端的用户超过了一定数量。


消息来源：The Register



老王点评：我的印象中，Twitter 的某个国内山寨品的衰落迹象之一，就是 API 不好用、开放平台名存实亡、封杀第三方客户端。]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[据“网信中国”微信公众号消息，为营造喜庆祥和的春节网上舆论氛围，中央网信办决定即日起开展为期1个月的“清朗·2023年春节网络环境整治”专项行动。此次专项行动开展时间为即日起至2月底。


具体整治以下六方面：


（一）持续巩固“饭圈”治理成果，切实维护良好网络文娱生态。一是密切关注春节晚会、春节档影视作品有关情况，整治借机挑唆粉丝群体互撕谩骂、攻击对立等问题，严防“饭圈”问题向体育、电竞等其他领域外溢。二是加强春节期间娱乐明星网上信息呈现规范管理，防止绯闻八卦、隐私爆料等信息占用公共平台资源。三是严禁网站平台借春节活动新设针对明星个人的榜单评选，不得变相诱导应援打榜。四是集中整治各类不良“网红”问题，严肃处置存在炒作劣迹行为史、刻意扮丑等问题的“网红”博主，查处炫耀服刑经历、美化服刑生活的所谓“励志网红”。


（二）严肃查处网络炫富、宣扬暴饮暴食等问题，避免不良风气反弹回潮。一是集中清理借“天价年夜饭”“天价年终奖”“瀑布式压岁钱”“巨额红包”“顶级豪宅”“天价彩礼”等刻意炫耀奢侈生活的图文视频信息，不得恶意炒作隐形炫富、故意攀比等问题。二是排查处置刻意展示春节期间暴饮暴食、大吃大喝画面，宣扬铺张浪费的信息。


（三）集中查处组织实施网络赌博、网络诈骗等违法违规行为。一是持续清理赌博引流信息，坚决关闭春节期间组织赌博交易的违法网站平台，严肃查处借棋牌类小游戏、夺宝游戏等名义或者利用建群发红包等功能变相从事网络赌博的行为。二是从严整治借“春运红包补贴”“春节集福”“有偿转让福卡”等名义实施网络诈骗问题，严防借“红包雨”“薅羊毛”等活动诱骗用户刷单。


（四）加大封建迷信和不良现象整治力度。一是持续清理鼓吹炒作封建迷信陋习的帖文、视频信息，处置提供算命、占卜违规服务等问题。二是严管借低俗着装、露骨动作等方式，打造“酒店媛”“景点媛”“雪媛”“农媛”“外卖媛”等各类低俗人设，进行炒作引流的问题。


（五）严管网络欺凌、网络沉迷等问题，加大未成年人保护力度。一是集中清理欺凌恶搞未成年人，或者诱导其从事危险动作的视频内容，持续整治利用“网红儿童”牟利等问题。二是严管利用儿童智能设备、网络游戏、游戏直播等渠道，向未成年人传播色情低俗、血腥暴力信息等问题。三是集中整治违规租号买号，鼓励家长主动为未成年人设置青少年模式，预防未成年人尤其是农村留守儿童沉迷网络。]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[这是一份关于如何理解 Linux 和 BSD 中 whereis 命令的初学者指南，还包括几个例子。




这篇文章是 Linux 命令 学习系列的一部分。

whereis 命令

whereis 命令是一个命令行程序，可以帮助你找出任何二进制可执行文件、源文件或手册页的路径或位置。

在告诉你如何使用 whereis 命令之前，让我们先看看其语法。

语法

以下是 whereis 命令的语法：

whereis [OPTIONS] FILE_NAME


whereis 命令的参数是你要搜索的程序名或文件名。该参数是必须的。

默认情况下，它在环境变量（如 HOME、USER、SHELL 等）中定义的路径中搜索程序。

让我们看下一些例子。

Linux 和 BSD 中 whereis 命令的例子

下面是 whereis 命令的一个简单例子，我试图搜索 firefox。在下面的输出中，你可以看到包含 firefox 文件或可执行文件的路径列表。

$ whereis firefox

firefox: /usr/bin/firefox /usr/lib64/firefox /etc/firefox /usr/share/man/man1/firefox.1.gz




带有选项 -l 的命令会显示其搜索的路径列表。比如:

$ whereis -l

bin: /usr/bin
bin: /usr/sbin
bin: /usr/lib
bin: /usr/lib64
bin: /etc
bin: /usr/games
bin: /usr/local/bin
bin: /usr/local/sbin
bin: /usr/local/etc
bin: /usr/local/lib

李孝悌，美国哈佛大学历史学博士，曾任台湾“中研院”历史语言研究所、近代史研究所研究员，香港城市大学中文及历史学系主任，现为台湾“中央”大学历史学研究所讲座教授。研究方向为明清以来的社会文化史、城市史。《恋恋红尘：中国的城市、欲望与生活》（以下简称《恋恋红尘》）是李孝悌教授的名作，已有中、英、日等多个语言版本，2022年10月，广西师范大学出版社推出了《恋恋红尘》最新的简体中文版。以此为契机，《上海书评》特邀南京大学中华民国史中心副教授胡箫白对李孝悌教授进行了专访，从《恋恋红尘》谈到其英文新著Opera, Society, and Politics in Modern China（Harvard University Press，2019）。在这篇访谈中李孝悌教授表示，回看自己几十年的学术体验，“逸乐”最能代表他的学术志向。

《恋恋红尘 : 明清江南的城市、欲望和生活》，李孝悌著，广西师范大学出版社2022年10月出版

新文化史的逻辑与方法正在成为“常识”
《恋恋红尘》近期由广西师范大学出版社再版，据我所知，近二十年来这本书以不同的面貌、文字与书名和读者见面，凸显了经久不衰的生命力。您觉得这本书为什么如此受欢迎？
李孝悌：广西师大的新版卖得很好，已经二刷了，这让我非常讶异。可能是因为这本书迎合了大众对新文化史的兴趣，这让我尤感慰藉。新文化史作为一个已经不算太新的史学思潮，在美国、法国、中国大陆的发展态势非常不一样。先讲美国。2019年时我去哈佛开一个关于“五四运动”的会议，算是重游故地，但发现哈佛的学术世界已经完全不一样了。一方面，我读书时常常流连的区域已经基本找不到书店了，倒是多了很多咖啡馆，虽然方便了学生一边用餐一边温习，但整体环境看起来有点颓靡，不太像读书的环境。仅存的两家书店里也全是全球史和后殖民理论的作品。此行期间我还去参加了蒋经国基金会办…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Mastodon 的又一次胜利！Medium 为其用户推出了一个 Mastodon 实例。




Mastodon 在最近一段时间的增长是巨大的；越来越多的人正在转向这个 Twitter 的替代品。

如果你不熟悉 Mastodon，它是目前 最好的主流社交媒体替代品 之一，有可能成为 Twitter 的替代品，它是 完全开源和去中心化的。

随着 Twitter 的不断发生变化和去年埃隆·马斯克对它的收购，更多的用户开始对 Mastodon 这个平台产生了浓厚的兴趣。

Vivaldi 最近推出了 其由 Mastodon 驱动的社区，Mozilla 基金会 也在考虑类似的东西。

现在，Medium 已经向前迈出了一步，推出了它们的 Mastodon 实例。

Medium 启动了一个由 Mastodon 驱动的社区

在 最近的公告 中，Medium 在 me.dm 推出了其 Mastodon 实例，专注于 “帮助他们的作者、出版物和读者在 联盟宇宙Fediverse 中找到一个家”。

该网站（即 Mastodon 实例）旨在成为 Medium 的用户的专属空间。



换句话说，它将成为 Medium 用户的专属社交网络平台。

有了这个网络平台，他们也可以开始进行 500 字以内的短文写作了。

Medium 的 CEO 提到：


相比之下，Mastodon 主要是为 500 字以内的短文写作服务的。用一个不太双关的说法：今天，我们正在借助 Mastodon 上的实例（me.dm）将我们用于发表长文的 Medium 扩展到短文 medium（小写 m）。除了更简短的形式外，Mastodon 还带来了围绕联盟概念的重要创新。


因此，看起来 Medium 正在试水和尝试新的东西。

对于那些喜欢一目了然的内容而不是冗长信息的用户来说，可能是一件好事。

如果操作得当，这对他们来说会有很好的效果。

**那么，你怎样才能加入 Medium 的 Mastodon 平台？


💡 你看，最初，只有选定的作者和出版物 才能进入这个 Mastodon 实例。现有的 Medium 用户可以尝试发送一个 注册请求，但要经过他们的批准。


因此，如果你发送一个注册请求，你得等待批准。

他们还计划作为付费会员的额外服务来邀请作家和读者。

他们已经在为他们的 Mastodon 实例开发一个 “用 Medium 注册” 的选项，这应该是为了让你更容易开始使用。

关于这一点，他们提到：


有这么多的 Mastodon 实例可供选择，我们计划让 me.dm 一开始就有几个重要的好处：可靠的基础设施和审核，一个短域名让你更容易分享你的用户名，为新用户提供更好的入门培训，以及一个有趣的本地信息源。


去中心化和开源平台的步伐加快了

去中心化的平台正在变得比人们十年前预期的更加流行。

最大的促成因素是大型科技公司越来越多的不稳定的变化和决定，迫使用户不断调整他们在社交媒体平台上的互动方式和理由。

有了开源和去中心化的平台，用户得到了透明度，更多的数据控制，以及更多的自由。

我们可能没有想到，Mastodon 作为一个平台，逐渐成为各种组织的社区建设的一个重要组成部分。因此，我们非常期待在不久的将来看到更多变化。

💭 欢迎在下面的评论中分享你的想法。

现在是为你的业务纳入在线视频内容的最佳时机。为什么？因为研究表明，全球在线视频市场正以每年约 20% 的速度增长。

而且，由于开发者们提供的一些优秀软件，任何人都可以轻松地创建视频内容，并在 YouTube 和 Twitch 等几个流行的平台上传播。如果你仔细想想，你会发现如今你在网上观看的视频内容比基于文本的内容更多。

因此，在这篇文章中，我们将列出一些适用于 Ubuntu 和其他 Linux 的免费软件，这些软件很容易用于为你和你的企业创建超级有趣的流媒体内容。

Linux 的五大流媒体直播应用

OBS Studio

本列表中的第一个免费应用程序是 OBS Studio（即 Open Broadcaster Software）。它是一个具有屏幕广播功能的流媒体直播应用程序，可用于 Linux、Windows 和 macOS。

出于几个原因，OBS Studio 是这个名单上最好的一个。它内置了编码，支持 RTMP 广播、多源、网络摄像头、绿屏、捕捉卡和你的应用程序窗口。

其用户界面相当简单明了，功能丰富。你可以从第三方开发的插件中获得帮助，以扩展其功能，例如，在直播时将 Twitter 上的实时推文混入你的流媒体。不过，OBS 不支持多比特率流媒体。



如何安装：

OBS Studio 可以在所有 Linux 发行版的官方软件库中找到。详细的安装说明见下面的链接。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[跟随这个演示，学习如何在 Rust 中使用文件系统模块。




知道如何读写文件对各种用途都很有用。在 Rust 中，这项任务是通过标准库中的文件系统模块（std::fs）完成的。在这篇文章中，我将向你介绍如何使用这个模块。

为了演示这项任务，我准备了一些示例代码，也可以在 GitHub 上找到。

准备工作

在使用 Rust 时，失败的函数会返回 Result 类型。尤其是文件系统模块会返回专门的类型 std::io::Result<T, Error>。有了这些知识，你可以从 main() 函数中返回相同的类型：

fn  main() ->  std::io::Result<()> {
/* ...code comes here... */


Rust 文件写入

在 Rust 中执行文件的 I/O 操作是相对容易的。写入文件可以简化为一行：

use  std::fs;
fs::write("favorite_websites.txt", b"opensource.com")?;
Ok(())


使用错误传播操作符 (?)，错误信息被传递到调用函数中，随后可以处理错误。由于 main() 是调用栈中唯一的其他函数，如果写操作失败，错误信息将被传递到控制台输出。

fs::write 函数的语法是非常先进的。第一个参数是文件路径，它必须是 std::path:ath 类型。第二个参数是内容，它实际上是一个字节切片（[u8]）。Rust 将传递的参数转换为正确的类型。幸运的是，这些类型基本上是下面的例子中所处理的唯一类型。

使用文件描述符类型 std::fs::File 可以实现对写操作更简洁的访问：

let mut file = fs::File::create("favorite_websites.txt")?;
file.write_all(b"opensource.com\n")?;
Ok(())


由于文件类型实现了 Write 特性，所以可以使用相关的方法来写入文件。然而，create 方法可以覆盖一个已经存在的文件。

为了获得对文件描述符的更多控制，必须使用 std::fs::OpenOptions 类型。这提供了类似于其他语言中的打开模式：

let mut file = fs::OpenOptions::new()
                            .append(true)
                            .open("favorite_websites.txt")?;
                            
file.write_all(b"sourceforge.net\n")?;


Rust 文件读取

适用于写的东西也适用于读。读取也可以通过简单的一行代码来完成：

let websites = fs::read_to_string("favorite_websites.txt")?;


以上一行读取文件的内容并返回一个字符串。除了读取字符串，还有 std::fs::read 函数，如果文件包含二进制数据，该函数会将数据读成一个字节向量。

下一个例子显示了如何将文件的内容读入内存，随后逐行打印到控制台：

let file = fs::File:pen("favorite_websites.txt")?;
let lines = io::BufReader::new(file).lines();

for line in lines {
    if let Ok(_line) = line {
        println!(">>> {}", _line);
    }
}


总结

如果你已经熟悉了其他编程语言，你可能已经注意到没有 close- 函数（或类似的）来释放文件句柄。在 Rust 中，当相关变量超出作用域，文件句柄就会被释放。为了定义关闭行为，可以在文件表示的周围应用作用域 ({ })。我建议你熟悉 Read 和 Write 特性，因为你可以在许多其他类型中找到这个特性的实现。

Ti Amo, translated by Martin Aitken, Archipelago, September 2022, 128pp

汉娜·奥斯塔维克（Hanne Ørstavik）这位来自挪威的杰出作家，近年来终于为英语读者所知。2014年英国佩瑞涅出版社推出《蓝色房间》英译本（挪威原版于1999年问世），这是一部篇幅短小、气氛紧张不安的寓言，讲述了一个年轻女子约翰娜的故事，她专横的母亲将她锁在卧室里。约翰娜原本要去机场与她的新男友一起出门旅行，她的母亲却另有想法。
《蓝色房间》（黛博拉·道金翻译）向读者展示了奥斯塔维克作品中许多长期延续的主题和模式：幽闭的环境、未得到满足的渴望、扭曲的爱、无法被信赖的母亲。奥斯塔维克笔下的人物经常发现自己被陌生的新边界所限制。也许是因为他们刚来到一个陌生的城市，或一个大雪覆盖的偏远村庄。爱人或丈夫可能已经被弃；新的恋情可能就要点燃。书中的人物能够暂时找到逃离之处，但他们的自我又总是常伴左右。简短、紧张、高度电影化的戏剧性情节在气氛浓厚的封闭环境中上演。奥斯塔维克在新书《我爱你》中写：“我的小说几乎总是从某个地点开始。”
《蓝色房间》问世四年后，马丁·艾特肯——也是全球知名的挪威作家卡尔·奥韦·克瑙斯高的译者——接下了翻译奥斯塔维克的事业。他从她最著名的作品《爱》开始，这是现代斯堪的纳维亚文学的经典之作，1997年在挪威首次出版。《爱》的主人公是一位年轻的单身母亲，一天晚上她把焦虑不安的八岁儿子丢在家里然后进城去玩。第二天是男孩的生日，他（并非没有理由地）担心妈妈已经把这天给忘了。在只能听天由命的情况下，他出门走入了冰冷的夜晚。
与《蓝色房间》一样，《爱》兼顾了现实主义的模式与梦幻般的语调。这本书极度诱人但又不安，赢得了美国笔会的译著奖。作为一个系列，艾特肯先生与杰出的群岛书店合作，在去年推出…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[《正仓院：宝物与交流》，[日]东野治之著，龚婷译，社会科学文献出版社2022年8月出版，264页，79.00元

去年10月，日本奈良国立博物馆循例举办第七十四回“正仓院展”，向世人展示正仓院收藏的部分古代宝物。条件所限，亲临其境并无可能。好在还有《正仓院：宝物与交流》一书，让国内读者可以一窥正仓院宝物的究竟。
“宝物”二字，强调的是其珍贵与稀有。有些出乎意料的是，作者东野治之在前言里开门见山：市面上并不缺乏“详尽介绍各个宝物的美术类书籍”。大概也是出于这个原因，《正仓院》其实对正仓院藏品本身的介绍不甚详细。比如，正仓院里藏有《王勃诗序》写本一卷。它是目前已知王勃著作的最早写本，文献价值极高。著名的“落霞与孤鹜齐飞”在正仓院本《滕王阁序》里就写作“落霞与孤雾齐飞”。但东野治之在书中仅只提到其抄写年代（公元八世纪初），此外几乎不置一词。
真正引起作者兴趣的，是正仓院藏品的域外来源——“这类进口物品包括各种乐器、室内摆设、染织品和部分佛具等，是正仓院宝物中最有代表性的一部分”。随之而来的问题则是，“为什么这些拥有复杂文化背景的宝物会保存在正仓院中”呢？
在今天，符合逻辑的答案自然是贸易。但古代东亚还有另一种物品交换的形式，这就是“朝贡”。当时日本向唐朝献上的物品名义上叫作“日本天皇赐予大唐皇帝之物”，但在唐朝方面看来，仍然是“朝贡”而已。抛开名分认知的差异，东野治之直白地承认，“无论是哪个国家，就算再憧憬中华文化，获取朝贡的回赐也才是主要目的”，而且“中国会向来朝贡的国家赐下比贡品更为高级的礼物也是再普通不过的常识”。这其实就是《礼记》里人们很熟悉的一个词，“厚往薄来”。也正因藏品的中国来源，“正仓院宝物带给人们的是一种直通长安的强烈感觉”。在西安曾经出土了与正仓院所藏球形香炉规制极为相似的银质香囊，而吐鲁番古墓也曾发现与正仓院藏品极为相似的刺绣鞋子。
除了直接的朝贡之外，正仓…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I need to replace my aging OnePlus3, and apparently what I'm looking for amounts to a tiny Linux laptop. Stumbled on the Cosmo Communicator from PlanetCom, and now I'm looking to get some feedback.
 At first glance, it checks all the boxes I want in a mobile device, and what reviews I've read were mostly positive. The devil's in the details, though, and I've still got some questions. Specifically with regard to running Linux on it.
  
Do you use it as your daily driver? If not, what's stopping you? I'm looking replace my "go bag" laptop and phone with this, so any warnings would be appreciated.
 It looks like PlanetCom supplies their own version of Linux. Has anyone run vanilla Debian on it? How's driver/hardware support and/or is it worth just sticking with their version?
 Do you trust PlanetCom's version any more or less than any other major Linux distro?
 In PlanetCom's version of Debian, what apt repos does it use? i.e. Does it rely on a repo run by PlanetCom, or does it use the regular Debian mirrors for that architecture? I don't want to lock all software updates into a single vendor.
 Does it work well/at all with a USB-C dock? I'd like to be able to use it as a full workstation from time to time. Specifically, does it work well under Debian?
 Can the dual sims both be active on LTE at once, or is one always in standby? When AT&T shut off 3G voice last year, I lost the ability to receive calls on the non-active SIM since my OP3 can only have one SIM active on LTE at once. I'd like to be able to receive calls on both SIMs again.
 Any issues receiving calls/texts in Debian? I'd like to not miss an important call while booted into the desktop environment.
 What are you major gripes about it?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm sorry I wrote non-rectangular but I really meant these 2 types of displays:
  
displays with cutouts/waterfalls/droplets/notch's etc. like the displays we have on newer phones these days which has little cutouts for the cameras and other components that would otherwise usually be in the top bezel. for reference, check iPhone X onwards and the newer MacBooks with notches. also interesting to see how curved and round displays are handled since on phones there is usually a "safe area" where content must be so not to be cut out by the rounded edges or other notches etc 
 foldable/flippable/rollable displays. these are displays that can basically fold into 2 adjacent displays or be used as one continuous displays depending on how the device is being operated by the user. for reference check Samsung Z Flip, Samsung Z Fold, Microsoft Duo and the Lenovo Yoga Book 9i announced at CES a few days ago
  
I'm not entirely sure how this is/would be managed whether it's on the Linux level, display compositor level or DE/toolkit level.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Let me explain... this is about the process of how programs are installed and ran on an OS, for example like Ubuntu Server.
 So I kind of had an "ah-ha" moment with Linux and I just want to make sure I can understand it correctly. There was a term I've read and heard about Linux that "Linux is just a bunch of files and folders" and I'd always ask myself, "What do you mean by that?" Then it hit me years later. So back in my high school days my school gave us Windows 8 tablets (YIKES) to use, and like standard IT organizations for schools and businesses, it was locked down with standard Windows UAC; so basically it was to do work only and you can't install any other programs. But since my friends were gamers we always wanted to "bend" the rules if possible.
 The game in choice was Halo CE. The game was extremely small (Under 150MB) and you can copy and paste the entire game from a flash drive, drag and drop to the desktop, and rename the folder to "schoolwork" so a teacher would never notice. On the flip side the program would never show up in the registry and Programs and Features on Windows, so it was hard to detect.
 So we would launch the .exe inside the folder and start LAN parties at school.
 Now fast forward to now and I just r/selfhosted my headless Minecraft server so my high school buddies can join my server. After SSH I created my directory, did the java stuff and accepted the EULA terms and conditions etc. Then that was when I had my "ah-ha" moment. 
 So if I'm understanding Linux Server installation correctly, programs are never "installed" on Linux they can just run on the contents within a given folder? 
 Is this the same concept for Linux Desktop also? 
 Reading this article is seems like its pretty flexible on the filesystem in general. 
 But I wanted to make sure if this is a good concept to follow OR maybe running a service like a Minecraft Server is a wildcard and depending on the program and or service it may be different. 
 Thanks!!!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So I have been over the last 3 years using mostly RHEL Linux. Mostly for monitoring, updates, and lvm/disk expansion, user creation in an MSP. I am looking to level up my skills a bit but my family travels a lot while I am not working and I can't always have a full size laptop or anything with me. 
 I am familiar with doing something like a raspberry pi. However I would like an integrated screen, enough memory to run an enterprise environment. (This could include wireless capability to use linode however I would like to run the base Linux build without internet if and when possible) I also have an unlimited data 4g router I can take. with me, a dedicated keyboard. 
 Really what I want is like a psp sized all in one computer that isn't a trash netbook and charges via usb-c. 
 Does anyone have anything they have seen or have come up with that fits this? I'm sure it could double over as a pentesting tool at some point but I'm less interested in that ATM.

 "In addition to Paizo, Kobold Press, Chaosium, Legendary Games, and a growing list of publishers have already agreed to participate in the Open RPG Creative License, and in the coming days we hope and expect to add substantially to this group.
 The ORC will not be owned by Paizo, nor will it be owned by any company who makes money publishing RPGs. Azora Law’s ownership of the process and stewardship should provide a safe harbor against any company being bought, sold, or changing management in the future and attempting to rescind rights or nullify sections of the license. Ultimately, we plan to find a nonprofit with a history of open source values to own this license (such as the Linux Foundation)."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey everyone, I’m Pedro, and together with my friend Paulo I co-founded MagnaPlay (https://magnaplay.tech). Basically, we’re a “Spotify”, but for games made by independent creators on PC.
Paulo and I have been indie gamers for the past decade. Both of us have insanely long back catalogs of games we’ve always wanted to try, but couldn’t. When we were stuck at home during covid, we were frustrated and decided to set out to solve this problem. Naturally, this decision was made during a game of Call of Duty: Warzone.
For consumers, MagnaPlay eliminates the paywall when it comes to buying a new game. Today, the indie market is incredibly saturated and prices are increasing. A subscription service, like Spotify, can make indie gaming more affordable and allow players to try out more content.

Now we are going to deep dive into the mount namespace.
 The goal of mount namespace is to provide isolation regarding the list of mounts as seen by the process/tasks in each namespace. By doing so different processes/tasks that belong to different mount namespaces will see distinct directories hierarchies (https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/mount_namespaces.7.html). 
 Using “/proc” we can inspect the mounting points visible for specific processes using “/proc/[PID]/mounts, “/proc/[PID]/mountinfo” and “/proc/[PID]/mountstats”. For more information a…]]></summary>

周三，美国联邦航空局（FAA）的空中任务通知系统发生严重故障，一度导致全美停飞航班。FAA 初步判断问题根源是一个数据库文件受损，而没有证据表明这是一次网络攻击。周二晚间 FAA 的计算机系统就出现了问题，于是他们在周三凌晨航班最少的时候重启了系统。但在经过 90 分钟的重启之后，该系统的功能没有完全恢复，而备份系统也同样发现存在问题。FAA 于是下达了全美的停飞令，导致了大规模航班延误和机场瘫痪。

因员工监控软件显示摸鱼，被勒令向公司返回工资

一名加拿大女子以远程方式从事会计工作，她最初声称自己去年被无故解雇，并要求获得赔偿。但该公司告诉法庭，该员工有 50 多个小时没有从事工作有关的任务。该公司说，在发现该员工分配的工作超出预算和进度后，该公司在其工作笔记本上安装了名为 TimeCampon 的员工追踪软件。该软件可以跟踪文件打开的时间，员工如何使用该文件，并将时间记录为工作时间。该软件可以将工作时间记录与使用笔记本电脑播放电影和电视节目等活动分开。法官因此判决该女子败诉并向公司返回部分工资。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[这个 "猜数字 "游戏是学习新编程语言的一个很好的入门程序，因为它以一种相当直接的方式锻炼了几个常见的编程概念。




当你想 学习一种新的编程语言 时，把注意力放在编程语言的共同点上是很好的：


变量

表达式

语句


这些概念是大多数编程语言的基础。一旦你理解了它们，你就可以开始琢磨其他的东西了。因为编程语言通常有相似之处，一旦你知道一种语言，你就可以通过了解其差异来学习另一种语言的基础知识。

学习新语言的一个好方法是用一个标准程序进行练习。这使你能够专注于语言，而不是程序的逻辑。在这个系列文章中，我使用了一个“猜数字”的程序，在这个程序中，计算机在 1 到 100 之间挑选一个数字，并要求你猜出来。程序循环进行，直到你猜对数字为止。

这个程序锻炼了编程语言中的几个概念：


变量

输入

输出

条件判断

循环


这是一个学习新的编程语言的很好的实践实验。

安装 Ada

Ada 编程语言 是一种独特的、高度结构化的语言，有专门一群开发者使用它。Ada 的工具链是 GNU Ada 开发环境，多被称为 GNAT。

你可以使用你的发行版的包管理器在 Linux 上安装 GNAT。在 Fedora、CentOS 或类似系统上：

$ sudo dnf install gcc-gnat


在 Debian、Linux Mint 及衍生版上:

$ sudo apt install gnat


在 macOS 和 Windows 上，你可以从 Adacore 网站 下载一个安装程序（从下拉菜单中选择你的平台）。

在 Ada 中猜数字

创建一个名为 game.adb 的文件。

这个程序使用的两个内置 Ada 库：Text_IO 和 Numerics.Discrete_Random：

But every time its been discussed its always focused on the same points - it does too much, whether or not it follows Unix philosophy. Then someone will point out its not just an init system but also unifies a bunch of other related tasks and others will whine and complain.
 What never seems to be mentioned is that the core principle of systemd is that it uses cgroups, which is a fundamental change and a much bigger deal. It allows specifying resource limits and quotas, monitoring etc in a way that simply wasn't possible before.
 cgroups themselves are a not very well known feature of the kernel that are the foundation of containers/docker/k8s etc.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[近日，北京大学国家发展研究院马京晶等人组成的课题组发布了一份新冠疫情感染报告，对本轮疫情的传播特征、民众感染后的症状、人群和地区间差异等进行了系统分析。报告显示，在“新十条”出台后大概13天，即12月20日，全国多地疫情就已达峰，到12月底各地感染均已过峰。截至2023年1月11日，全国新冠感染率累积约达到64%，感染人数累积约9亿。


在区域感染差异上，报告显示本轮累积感染率最高的前三名省份均属于西部地区，第一名甘肃省约达91%，第二名云南省约84%，第三名青海省约80%。


报告课题组成员北京大学国家发展研究院副教授马京晶对经济观察网表示，在互联网上北上广疫情声量很大，但数据估计西部地区感染率可能更高。


马京晶介绍，这些感染率是模型估计数据，是根据网络平台上对感染新冠后相关症状的搜索量计算而得。简单来说，就是网上对“发烧”“咳嗽”等症状搜索上升了，也就代表感染率上升了。感染率的原始数据主要由脉策数据提供，该公司抓取了国内多家网络平台上关于新冠症状的搜索数据，在这些数据基础上，课题组成员计算了全国、各省、各城市的感染率。


马京晶说，现在很多公众都很希望了解到感染率数据，但完全准确的数据现下不可能得到，通过此类大数据方法可以快速全面的估算各地感染率，而且成本较低。虽然此类方法会受到一些影响搜索的随机因素或固有习惯影响，跟现实有一定差距，但在疫情暴发期间，快速全面了解全国各地的大致感染率，对相关部门进行医疗资源的调配可以起到重要作用。


“大小数据相结合”可更合理配置医疗资源


除了大数据方法外，课题组还使用了问卷调查（小数据）方法。在疫情高峰期在全国进行了问卷调查，共获取有效样本11443人。


马京晶解释，“大数据方法可快速估算出每日各地的感染率，但想要服务于医疗资源调配，还需要了解感染后各种症状出现的可能性、用药率、就医率、…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[明代苏州传奇人物周丹泉，以神技名世，其曾祖周诏为嘉靖帝的老师。有记载说他名秉忠、字时臣，也有记载称其名时臣、字秉忠。和很多古人一样，他当年以号行，我也顺水推舟，称这位绝世高人为周丹泉。
明代几位大佬都写到过周丹泉，不夸张地说，若得其中一人片言只语赞扬，被赞者足以记入艺术史。周丹泉是叠山理水的前辈，研究园林的人无不服膺于他，苏州留园和惠荫园的假山均留有他的手笔。吴县县令袁宏道当年游玩留园后，盛赞周丹泉非凡的造园技艺。苏州另一位地方长官江盈科对留园的假山亦赞不绝口。高濂则在《遵生八笺》中，赞扬周丹泉所制定窑鼎炉和定窑彝炉。陈继儒对周丹泉烧制的陶印至为欣赏，《妮古录》称其“色如定，文亦古”。彼时的文玩大亨李日华，眼光一流，见解独到，他的著作《味水轩日记》也记载了周丹泉高超的古器物修复技术。
周丹泉的传奇故事颇多。姜绍书曾于崇祯时任南京工部郎，他在《韵石斋笔谈》中说：常州唐鹤征藏有宋定窑鼎，周丹泉见到此器后，“以手度者再”，再以“片楮摹鼎纹”。半年后，周丹泉仿造出与唐家一模一样的鼎。唐鹤征取出家藏宋定窑鼎的盖子、座子，竟然与周丹泉的鼎严丝合缝。唐鹤征惊奇不已，周丹泉以实相告：“实仿为之，不相欺也。”唐鹤征遂以四十金买下周丹泉的仿品。

台北故宫博物院藏“周丹泉造”款娇黄锥拱兽面纹鼎

韩世能是董其昌的老师，展子虔《游春图》和张择端《清明上河图》均是他的藏品。韩世能曾请周丹泉招仙画祖先遗像。周丹泉到了韩家，掐指一算，徐徐说：“今日之仙宜至。”果然，不一会飞来三只白鹤，旋即白鹤盘旋，多至五只、七只、九只，摩空耀日，最后共有十二只之多。待祖先画像完成，“衣冠笑貌，俨若生存”。韩家子孙见后，又惊又喜，纷纷下拜。此事见韩世能《仙应图记》一文。我觉得，周丹泉应该是古代大型魔术的先行者。
前年，我撰文考证，推测周丹泉是文震孟、文震亨两兄弟的舅舅。文震孟是苏州状元，文震亨著有《长物志》，两人同为文…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[OBS Studio 29 是一个令人兴奋的版本，在所有平台上都有关键的改进。




OBS Studio 是最受欢迎的开源屏幕录制和流媒体软件之一。

许多 Linux 用户和内容创作者都在使用它，它有一套相当不错的工具和功能，可以让你录制和串流内容。

它的上一个主要版本发布于 2022 年 9 月，它带来了对苹果芯片的原生支持、更新了用户界面、改进了颜色支持等等。

它的下一个版本，即 v29，似乎有点意思，但对 Linux 用户来说变化不大 😞

OBS Studio 29 的新变化



这个版本有大量的改进和修复；其中一些亮点包括：


对 Linux 的媒体键支持

新的音频过滤器

改进的英伟达视频和音频过滤器

更好的编码器支持

各种修复和改进


媒体键支持： 你终于可以用键盘上的媒体键来控制 Linux 上的 OBS 的播放或音量了。

新的音频过滤器： OBS Studio 29 具有两个新的音频滤波器，一个向上压缩滤波器和一个 3 波段均衡器滤波器。

改进的英伟达视频和音频过滤器： 对这些过滤器进行了各种改进。

增加了一个新的屏蔽刷新滑块，同时支持时间处理，这应该是为了提供更好的屏蔽质量。

更好的编码器支持：，OBS Studio 29 对几个编码器的支持得到了改善，例如：


Windows 上的用于 AMD RX7000 系列 的 AV1 编码器。

Windows 上的用于英特尔 Arc GPU 的 AV1 编码器。

Windows 上的英特尔 HEVC 编码器。

macOS 上的原生 HEVC 和 ProRes 编码器。



📋 注意，这些编码器只支持 Windows 或 macOS。可悲的是，他们少了对 Linux 的支持。我们希望在 OBS Studio 的未来版本中加入这些功能。


各种修复和改进： 除了上面列出的那些，OBS Studio 29 还有很多其他的变化，例如：


Websockets 5.1.0

回放缓冲区的内存限制现在被限制在已安装的系统内存的 75%，而不是固定在 8GB。

支持对 SRT 和 RIST 输出的加密和认证。

能够检查和/或静音个别的浏览器底座。

在视频捕获的情况下，支持更高的刷新率。


关于更多的技术细节，你可以查看 官方发布说明。

下载 OBS Studio 29

要获得最新的 OBS Studio 29，你可以使用 Flatpak，这是推荐的方法。

你也可以看看其官方下载页面中提到的其他安装方法。


OBS Studio 29

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Title basically says it all. I've been getting into kernel hacking and a little bit of independent osdev lately and I've come across a few large and small issues that I have with the current Linux kernel. So far my top three are:
  
The filesystem hierarchy in regards to new users and fragmentation of functionality (/var/www v.s. /srv, etc). It's not technically kernel specific, but it'd likely take an overhaul of the source code to make it feasible and not entirely broken
 The amount of random drivers and kernel modules included by default (This is also a security risk as seen by various CVEs exploiting filesystem drivers... cough cough overlayfs)
 Lack of abstraction in regards to basic functionality that most OS's would consider part of the kernel. This isn't really a code issue per say more so a personal gripe that I have with the Linux ecosystem. If you've ever tried to install LinuxFromScratch you'd know how many freaking programs you have to install to get a basic cmdline install.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Is there a distro with zero root access? And what would that be like? WouId there be limitations to zero root access? I would imagine that the apps would be appimages, since you don't need root to install and use these.
 Wouldn't such a system be foolproof since the user cannot muck about the root file system and change anything, and more secure because the user doesn't know or have a root password at all.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Chromium browser project has announced
that it will be integrating support for third-party libraries written in Rust.



	 Our goal in bringing Rust into Chromium is to provide a simpler
	 (no IPC) and safer (less complex C++ overall, no memory safety
	 bugs in a sandbox either) way to satisfy the rule of two, in order
	 to speed up development (less code to write, less design docs,
	 less security review) and improve the security (increasing the
	 number of lines of code without memory safety bugs, decreasing the
	 bug density of code) of Chrome. And we believe that we can use
	 third-party Rust libraries to work toward this goal.
	 
	 Rust was developed by Mozilla specifically for use in writing a
	 browser, so it’s very fitting that Chromium would finally begin to
	 rely on this technology too. Thank you Mozilla for your huge
	 contribution to the systems software industry. Rust has been an
	 incredible proof that we should be able to expect a language to
	 provide safety while also being performant.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello, took me quite some time to figure it all out, information is scattered all over the place and had to figure some stuff myself, so here it is :
 I wanted to play tidal from the smartphone to the PC that is connected to a sub + speakers, so I don't I have to stand up every now and then to switch albums, but also allow guests to play music from their phone.
 So far so good, one can pair the smartphone with a pin on both ends, and if pipewire/wireplumber is installed it uses good codecs (for me ldac doesn't works for some reason, so aptx HD it is)
 Problem is I was recently gifted a bluetooth-capable Sony turntable that won't even try to connect to a bluetooth device advertising itself as a PC, only if it's listed as an audio receiver such as "bluetooth speaker" will it attempt to pair.
 In order to do that we must change the bt class of the PC, there's a setting in /etc/bluetooth/main.conf, except it does nothing by default (welcome to linux)
 So, still, I set "Class = 0x040414" and "Name = FaKeHiFi" in /etc/bluetooth/main.conf, then found out I had to edit /etc/systemd/system/bluetooth.target.wants/bluetooth.service with "ExecStart=/usr/libexec/bluetooth/bluetoothd --noplugin=hostname" for this setting to be taken into account (this is on debian, ymmv)
 Now, the turntable attempts to connect, but immediately disconnects when authorized.
 No amount of "sudo bluetoothctl --agent=NoInputNoOutput", "hciconfig hci0 sspmode 1" and such helps it, nothing.
 I finally found out I had to set "JustWorksRepairing = always" in /etc/bluetooth/main.conf for it to stay connected and not bother with a pin.
 Hope that helps someone some day as it's been quite a headache tbh.

        <id>https://www.williamlong.info/archives/7050.html</id>
        <link href="https://www.williamlong.info/archives/7050.html"/>
        <updated>2023-01-12T14:41:30.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[据悉，苹果CEO官蒂姆·库克的总薪酬将在2023年减少40%以上，至4900万美元，原因是投资者的反馈以及库克本人要求调整薪酬。该公司周四在一份文件中说，大部分薪酬将以股票授予的形式发放。


苹果公司表示：“考虑到苹果公司的相对规模、范围和业绩，薪酬委员会还打算将库克先生未来几年的年度目标薪酬定位在我们主要同行的80%至90%之间。”


从苹果公布的消息看，去年库克的年薪达到了近1亿美元，而这9900万美元的薪酬方案中，包含了大部分的苹果股票。


库克此前9900万美元的薪酬方案遭到了机构股东服务等组织的批评，但去年大多数股东投票通过了这一方案。顶级咨询公司ISS抱怨称，库克的股票将在退休后继续发放，而且一半的奖励并不取决于公司股价等业绩标准。


库克的总薪资一共包含三部分，300万美元（折合约0.20亿人民币）的基本工资，600万美元（折合约0.40亿人民币）的奖金，以及一部分股权奖励。这次薪资调整的部分也全都属于第三部分，也是其薪酬中最重要、占比最大的一部分。


2022年，库克股权奖励的价值估计约为7500万美元（折合约5.04亿人民币），其中有一半的因素与苹果的股票表现挂钩，今年这一部分价值降至4000万美元（折合约2.69亿人民币），并且薪酬委员会将其与股票表现挂钩的金额占比提高到了75%。


考虑到苹果公司的整体规模和业绩表现等，薪酬委员会还打算将库克未来几年的目标年薪定在其相对应的主要同行CEO的80%至90%之间。


2021年，库克的股票和现金收入达到了9870万美元，同比增长571%。这也导致一些股东、咨询公司反对库克的天价薪资方案。


2022年初，股东服务公司Institutional Shareholder Services就建议苹果投资者拒绝授予库克9900万美元的薪酬方案，称其对相当于公司普通员工收入1400倍的超额薪酬感到“严重担忧”。


不过，去年苹果年度股东大会上，大多数股东投票批准了该方案。当时，股东服务公司Institutional Shareholder Services的相关负责人抱怨说，库克的股票在退休后仍将归属他，而且有一半的奖励并不取决于公司股价等业绩标准。


这是因为调整之前，库克股权奖励的价值有50%基于股票表现，另外50%则预计其工作时间等。

 We also have fex coming to arm linux and such and maybe already here so.
 I do however would love to do everything that we always did on pc with risc v.

OpenAI 发布于 2020 年的 GPT-3 有 1750 亿个参数。根据传闻，即将在 2023 年初发布的 GPT-4 的参数约为 100 万亿。如果将参数比作人类的神经元，这一数量的参数大致相当于人类大脑中存在的神经元连接的数量，而人类实际上并没有使用我们大脑的全部容量。按照 GPT-3 对其前代产品的进步，GPT-4 将在能力、范围和潜力方面与我们目前的 GPT-3 版本的 ChatGPT 相比，可能拥有一个质的飞跃。

美联邦机构 1/5 的密码在安全审计中被破解

美国内政部最近的一次的安全审计发现，在测试的近 9 万个加密哈希值中，只用了 90 分钟就破解了 16% 的密码，最后有 21% 的账户密码被破解。这些被破解的密码涉及 28 个高价值资产中的 25 个，占比近 90%。破解这些密码只使用了一台价值 15000 美元的设备。值得注意的是，被破解的绝大多数密码都符合密码复杂性要求，该要求规定密码必须至少有 12 个字符，并且至少包含大写、小写、数字和特殊字符等四种字符类型中的三种。


消息来源：Ars Technica



老王点评：传统的“强密码”理论已经不合时宜。多个无关联的单词组成的长密码会更安全一些，最好是使用密码管理器生成随机密码，以及辅助使用多因子认证。




美国原住民要求阿帕奇基金会改名

美国的一个民间组织呼吁阿帕奇软件基金会Apache Software Foundation（ASF）改名，以尊重美国原住民，并遵守其自身的行为准则。他们指责 ASF 出于品牌推广的目的盗用原住民文化。该团体对他们所说的阿帕奇部落只存在于过去的历史背景中的说法提出异议。ASF 表示已经知晓此事，但“变化需要时间与成员、董事会和我们的法律团队进行仔细权衡。我们的成员正在探索其他解决方法。”


消息来源：The Register



老王点评：我觉得，要是没有 ASF，可能很多人都不知道阿帕奇部落，我不觉得这是恶意滥用。而且，据我所知，Apache 起名的部分灵感来自于对 NCSA 服务器的修补版。]]></summary>

1979年春天的一个早上，我和同班同学林君跑到宿舍天台上，拿着惠特曼的《草叶集选》（楚图南译本） 激动地翻看、大声地读着，结果这个上午就翘课了。《为你，啊，民主哟！》《我在春天歌唱着这些》《我歌唱带电的肉体》《啊，船长，我的船长哟！》……光是这些题目就足以让我们激动得跺脚；第一首诗《给外邦》，只有三行：“我听说你们在寻找什么东西来打破新世界这个谜，/ 并为美国，为她的强有力的民主制度下个定义，/ 因此我把我的诗篇送给你们，使你们在其中看到你们所需要的东西。”对于这两个七七级历史系学生来说，这似乎是冲着我们说的。那是在思想解放运动中的一次小小的个人阅读事件，对以后的精神成长无疑有深远的影响。很多年以后，从一些人的回忆文章中也看到了当年我们阅读惠特曼诗歌的那种激动与影响。不过，自从那次楼顶阅读之后，惠特曼再也没有以那么震撼的方式进入我的阅读记忆，虽然《草叶集》仍时有翻看。直到2019年5月，我和妻子在纽约公共图书馆看了惠特曼诞辰两百周年纪念特展，惠特曼再次以触目的方式进入我们的视野。这个展览一方面以极为丰富的图文史料把我们引向惠特曼生活于其中的历史语境，尤其是在纽约看这些资料更有感觉；另一面是展览的导向，“他的名字几乎成为包容、平等、感性和个体价值等观念的代名词”，这与当年读《草叶集选》已经不是同一个层面了。

现在回想起来，当年在我们对惠特曼诗歌的激动中也有某种朦胧的不安，虽然在那个时候完全没有想到会与国家主义、民粹主义的关联，那种不安来自诗歌中对奴隶主同样有所赞美，这对于正在学习世界史的我们来说…]]></summary>

张爱玲在逝世前一年出版了《对照记——看老照相簿》，薄薄的书中用整整一页披露了她与李香兰的合影，背后一页附有说明：1943年在游园会中遇见日本影星李香兰。
为了验证此事，我去查阅《申报》，从此掉进了广告的海洋，沉下去后竟发现了一片新大陆，看到了张爱玲文学之树背后那片广袤的影视森林。
查阅的首次成果是更正了张爱玲的记忆误差：游园会是在1944年7月8日举行的，合影的拍摄则是在一年后的纳凉会上。
游园会全名为“市民游园讲演会”，是上海新闻联合会“鉴于南太平洋战争与欧亚大陆战局之激烈，为使一般人士进一步认识起见”在静安寺路哈同花园举行的，会上有军人讲演，电影公司红星歌唱，最后放映了“名片”《鸾凤和鸣》。第二天，《申报》用很大的篇幅报道了前日盛况：数千人参加了活动，报道的名单里有中共地下工作者袁殊、鲁风等。
可以想象，此时上映的电影，宣传色彩一定相当浓厚。那么，《鸾凤和鸣》究竟宣传了什么，又是怎样宣传的呢？此问在脑海里存疑多年。
2021年，在一次云端研讨会上，日本的中坚研究者菅原庆乃教授以“孤岛・占领期上海的映画特刊与说明书——使用无胶片资料的事例”为题作报告，探讨在看不到影像的条件下研究电影的可能性，并且公告研究者，她已将收集到的电影特刊存入资料库，可供查阅。
时隔二十年，终于看到了电子版《鸾凤和鸣》。
《鸾凤和鸣》

华影（中华电影联合股份有限公司）特刊

                  
华影特刊以《美丽的抒情诗》为题，首先介绍了此片“在方沛霖的细腻手法下，已经大功告成”，接着谈到周璇的歌唱，给了影片极高的评价：
《鸾凤和鸣》好比一首美丽舒畅的抒情诗，传播出婉转的情调，感人肺腑，动人心弦。
《鸾凤和鸣》好比一枝怒放美艳的花朵，芬芳清秀，香气扑鼻，散播在四周围。
一个曲折的故事，加以锐利的笔锋，完全是轻松的素描。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[下面是一份关于理解 Linux 和 BSD 中的 w 命令的初学者指南，并附有几个例子。




这篇文章是 Linux 命令学习系列的一部分。

w 命令

w 命令是 Linux 中的一个工具，它显示当前登录到系统中的用户及其进程的信息。它显示谁已登录，以及他们正在做什么活动。这意味着它可以显示他们在系统中运行什么进程。

语法

下面是 w 命令的基本语法：

w [options] [username]


w 命令接受一个可选的选项列表，然后是一个可选的用户名。如果指定了用户名，w 将只显示该用户拥有的进程信息。

w 命令的例子及其用法

下面是一些使用 w 命令的例子。

当你只用 w 运行它时，它显示以下输出：

$ w
 21:45:07 up 1 day, 12:48,  1 user,  load average: 1.05, 0.85, 0.56
USER     TTY        LOGIN@   IDLE   JCPU   PCPU WHAT
debugpoi tty2       Thu08   36:48m  0.03s  0.03s /usr/libexec/gnome-session-binary




解释：USER 列给出了用户名，然后是终端号、登录日期时间、空闲时间、CPU 使用率，以及用户正在执行的进程。


USER - 在你的 Linux 或 BSD 系统中登录的用户名称。

TTY - 当前会话的终端标识符号。

FROM - 用户的主机名或 IP 地址。

LOGIN@ - 用户登录的时间。它有时会根据你的系统设置显示日期。

IDLE - 用户与终端交互后的空闲时间。

JCPU - 该会话的所有用户进程使用的 CPU 时间。

PCPU - 该用户的进程（在 WHAT 字段中提到）使用的时间。

WHAT - 当前带参数的进程。


下面是 w 命令的另一个例子，有两个用户在虚拟机环境中登录。正如你所看到的，显示了两个用户名与当前运行的带有进程参数的独立进程。



让我们看一下这个命令的一些选项。

要停止显示标题，使用 -h 选项。它与 --no-header 开关相同。

$ w -h


-f 选项可以在输出中切换 FROM 字段的可见性。

$ w -f


使用 -s 选项打印一个简短的输出，不包括 JCPU、PCPU 和 LOGIN@ 信息。

$ w -s


要显示一个特定用户（例如，debugpoint）拥有的所有进程的列表：

$ w debugpoint


结束语

我希望这篇文章能帮助你了解 w 命令及其基本原理。你也可以阅读 w 手册页 来了解更多。如果你有任何问题，请告诉我。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[1月11日消息，据苹果官网消息，Apple 今日推出了 Apple Business Connect。这款免费工具让各种规模的企业都能认领相应地址的地点卡，并自主设计关键信息在 Apple 地图、信息、钱包、Siri 等各种 App 中向超过十亿 Apple 用户展示的方式。


Apple Business Connect 是一款全新的免费工具，让企业可以在地点卡中自定义显示精美图像、关键信息和特别促销活动


“我们创造 Business Connect 以便让世界各地的 Apple 用户都能找到关于美食、购物、旅行目的地的精确信息。” Apple 服务业务高级副总裁 Eddy Cue 表示，“Apple Business Connect 为所有商家提供了实用的工具，让他们可以更直接地和顾客建立联系、更好地掌控超过十亿用户每天浏览和使用产品和服务的方式。”


地图 App 的地点卡上的信息会通过 Siri、钱包、信息和其他 App 展示给超过十亿 Apple 用户。


苹果称，有了 Business Connect，全世界的企业都可以直接在 Apple 地图 App 的互动式地点卡中管理自己的信息，比如添加并更新照片与 logo、让顾客在地图 App 里直接点餐或预订座位、向顾客介绍特别促销活动等。地点卡新增 Showcase 功能，让企业可以向顾客展示优惠或促销，如当季菜单、产品折扣等等。企业可以通过 Business Connect 轻松更新他们地点卡中的 Showcase 栏目。即日起，Showcase 功能在美国地区开始使用，并会在接下来的数月内向全球企业开放。


据悉，企业还能重点展示可在地图 App 地点卡中直接执行的操作，来为顾客提供实用信息。例如使用 Insacart 订购日常用品、借助 Booking.com 预订酒店、通过 OpenTable 预订晚餐席位等等，只需轻轻一点即可完成。


有了 Business Connect，企业可以向顾客展示优惠或促销信息，还能重点展示用户可以在地图 App 地点卡中直接执行的多种操作。


企业所有者可以在任何台式或笔记本电脑上用现有的 Apple ID 或创建新的 Apple ID 访问自助网站注册 Business Connect。当一家企业完成录入并经 Apple 验证后，即可认领相应地址并开始免费更新他们的地点卡内容并且进行个性化设置。


苹果还称，在设计 Business Connect 时同样心怀小型企业，为他们提供和国际品牌相同的自订企业数字形象的途径和功能。Business Connect 和 Apple 专为促进小型企业成长和触达用户的多样服务相辅相成，这些服务包括 iPhone 上的轻点即付，让企业可以无缝且安全地兼容 Apple Pay、无接触信用卡与借记卡及其他数字钱包，仅需使用 iPhone 一触；又如订阅服务 Business Essentials，一站式提供设备管理、全天候支持服务和云存储服务。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[在刚刚结束的 openEuler Summit 2022 上，华为服务器 OS 首席架构师、openEuler 社区技术委员会委员熊伟为广大开发者介绍了 openEuler 在过去 3 年的成就和成果。而其中最值得关注的是，openEuler 在云、服务器、边缘计算、嵌入式等四大场景下的八个技术方向的创新。

用熊伟博士的话来说，“在过去的三年里，openEuler 深入行业和产业，用八个技术方向的纵深创新，引领全场景的产业领先”。接下来，作为一个一直关注开源操作系统的技术人，我分享一下我的理解。

可编程内核：系统调度的极限追求

首先介绍一下可编程内核。

我们知道，内核是一个操作系统的核心。对于我们所熟悉的 PC 和服务器，由于对资源的消耗和性能的需求没有那么的敏感，无需毫厘必争，所以往往不太需要在内核层面做删减，正常使用即可。删减内核功能的成本可能远高于增加内存的成本。

但对于资源消耗和成本更加敏感的边缘计算、嵌入式设备来说，每一丝的资源占有，都是难以估量的成本。对于资源集群量级极大的云计算场景而言，每 0.1% 的性能优化，对于整个集群而言，都是十分可观的收益。一个可编程的内核相比于模块化的内核，为生产环境下的优化提供了更多的可能性 —— 工程师可以根据业务的实际变化，随时调整内核的实现和策略，从而优化系统的性能。

在这种情况下，对于内核进行组装，支持可编程能力，就变得极其重要。openEuler 创新性地借鉴了社区当中 eBPF 的思想，并在此基础之上，将内核的机制和框架进行了分离，将框架内置到内核，实现的功能和策略则可以在开发完成后，注入到内核中即可实现对内核二次编程的效果。

说起来简单，但在具体落实层面，openEuler 做了不少的工作来达成这个目标：

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[了解 MySQL 如何存储和显示你的字符串变量，以便你能更好地控制你的数据。


字符串是你在 MySQL 中使用的最常见的数据类型之一。许多用户在他们的数据库中插入和读取字符串，而没有认真地了解过它们。本文旨在让你深入了解 MySQL 如何存储和显示你的字符串变量，以便你能更好地控制你的数据。

你可以把字符串分成两类：二进制和非二进制。你可能在大多数时候想到的是非二进制字符串。非二进制字符串有字符集和排序的不同。另一方面，二进制字符串存储诸如 MP3 文件或图像等东西。即使你在二进制字符串中存储了一个词，比如“歌曲”，它的存储方式也与非二进制字符串不同。

我将重点讨论非二进制字符串。MySQL 中的所有非二进制字符串都与字符集和排序相关。字符串的字符集控制哪些字符可以存储在字符串中，而它的排序方式控制当你显示字符串时如何排序。

字符集

要查看你系统中的字符集，请运行以下命令：

SHOW CHARACTER SET;


这个命令将输出四列数据，包括字符集：


名称

简要描述

默认的排序方式

字符集中每个字符的最大尺寸


MySQL 过去默认为 latin1 字符集，但自 8.0 版以来，默认为 utf8mb4。现在的默认排序方式是 utf8mb4_0900_ai_ci。ai 表示该排序对音调不敏感（ á = a），而 ci 则指定它对大小写不敏感（a = A）。

不同的字符集将其字符存储在内存中不同大小的块中。例如，从上面的命令可以看出，存储在 utf8mb4 的字符被存储在 1 到 4 个字节大小的内存中。如果你想看看一个字符串是否包含多字节的字符，你可以使用 CHAR_LENGTH() 和 LENGTH() 函数。CHAR_LENGTH() 显示一个字符串包含多少个字符，而 LENGTH() 显示一个字符串有多少…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[公元759年岁暮（乾元二年十二月底），杜甫经历近一个月的艰难跋涉，自秦州抵达成都。
初到成都，面对陌生的异乡景色与人事，他写下《成都府》一诗：
翳翳桑榆日，照我征衣裳。我行山川异，忽在天一方。但逢新人民，未卜见故乡。大江东流去，游子日月长。曾城填华屋，季冬树木苍。喧然名都会，吹箫间笙簧。信美无与适，侧身望川梁。鸟雀夜各归，中原杳茫茫。初月出不高，众星尚争光。自古有羁旅，我何苦哀伤。
成都自秦以来一直为蜀郡治所。唐初改蜀郡为益州，置总管府。剑南西川节度使亦治成都。天宝初从益州又改回蜀郡。安史之乱后，玄宗避难成都，从天宝十五年（至德元年756）至至德二年年底（757），玄宗在成都驻跸一年多，“至德二年十月，驾回西京，改蜀郡为成都府，长史为尹”（《旧唐书·地理志》六）。
蜀地开发很早，境内稻菽桑麻盐铁水利资源都极其丰富。《汉书·地理志》说巴蜀“土地肥美，有江水沃野，山林竹木疏食果实之饶”。由于地理优势，战乱较少，社会经济发展，人民生活相对安定富庶。安史之乱中，关陇、中原甚至江南地区均受到侵扰和破坏，只有蜀地为流亡的皇帝和朝廷百官，以及因战乱流离失所的百姓提供了一个避难的场所。玄宗入蜀后，在成都留驻了将近一年半时间，并且在此遥控朝政，成都一度成为另一个政治中心。虽然此时玄宗已回到长安，但皇帝驻跸带来的影响还在，这一点也是杜甫在同谷失据后选择入蜀到成都的重要考虑。
面对乱世中这样一座繁华富足的都市，诗人的感慨强烈而复杂。有秦岭为屏障，深冬的成都依然树木葱郁，令北来的旅人眼目为之清新。而在四方战乱之中，成都的繁荣和逸乐更让杜甫有种时空错置之感。杜甫的行程，是从北面抵成都，再折向城市西南方向。他的观察目光，也由远及近，从野外行至近郭，人烟渐渐稠密，看到许多风俗、语音都和关陇故乡完全不同的人民。江水蜿蜒东去，像诗人异乡游子的生活完全看不到尽头。“信美无与适”，杜甫此时的心情，如同汉末从战乱…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[MasterPlus 将被彻底改造并推出开源版本？听起来不错！




大多数游戏/外设软件套装要么是专有的，要么是没有对 Linux 的官方支持。

因此，我们必须不断寻找开源工具来配置我们的硬件以获得原生功能。

像 Piper、OpenRGB、Solaar 等在这些情况下都很有用。

但是，有时候，即使是这些也是不够的。

幸运的是，酷冷至尊（CoolerMaster） 已经决定发布其 MasterPlus 软件的开源版本，旨在为其散热器和第三方的散热器提供服务。

虽然这并不能保证它可以用在 Linux 系统上，但我们绝对可以期待它。

此举也应该鼓励雷蛇和罗技这样公司考虑制作精简过的开源工具。

让我们看看酷冷至尊打算怎么做。

MasterPlus 开源版本：我们目前所知的情况



酷冷至尊在最近的 CES 2023 活动中透露了他们计划发布新的 MasterPlus 开源版本。感谢来自 Boring Text Reviews 的 Albert 让我们注意到了这一点。

预期会有什么？ 对 MasterPlus 软件进行了全面的重新设计，有一个 API 插件系统，允许非酷冷至尊散热器与之整合。

他们已经澄清，酷冷至尊的独有功能不能配合其他散热器一起工作。因此，诸如检测 AIO 散热器的泄漏或计算 PSU 的效率等，都不能对第三方产品进行跟踪。

相反，该应用程序将只支持读取基本的性能信息，如温度和风扇速度，并能够配置 ARGB 设备。

如果你问我，这总比没有好。 而且，如果你的系统碰巧使用了酷冷至尊的组件，这对你来说是一个令人兴奋的消息！

酷冷至尊还展示了 API 系统的潜在应用，让它与一个照片应用程序挂钩，用它来控制集成在电脑机箱侧面的辅助显示器。

此外，他们还介绍了其软件的全面云整合。但遗憾的是，这部分不会开源。

什么时候？ 我们还没有 MasterPlus 开源的具体发布日期。

但是，如果让我猜，2023 年的某个时候是最好的选择。

💬 即使该工具没有被确认可以在 Linux 上工作，对开源工具来说也是一个好的开始，不是吗？你怎么看？

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Obviously Linux shenanigans enables breathing new life into things that’d otherwise be long dead.
 My daily driver is a 2015 MacBook Pro with a problematic logic board I pulled out of an abandoned hoard. The SSD isn’t even fastened so it just bounces around all willy nilly. It can’t successfully run or install MacOS. But I still get a solid 3 hours battery life at full normal usage incl web browsing, a couple Teams meetings etc.
 I run a weekly backup/update/reboot with anacron and make no effort to stop that from triggering whenever it wants to. If it happens during a meeting I just let it, because it reboots so fast I’m back in the meeting in no time and just say “Sorry, disconnected.” Typing pw to decrypt is like 75% of the whole reboot time.
 Its logic board problem seems to mostly affect its ability to properly power certain hardware components esp when it goes through different power states, along with some erratic charging behavior. So I just have it power off on lid switch.
 I really didn’t expect much from this heap but it works great! Super snappy, super reliable for my needs. And it has a TIMER TO TURN OFF THE KEYBOARD LIGHT WHEN IDLE which isn’t even available on cutting edge Apples. (Unless they added that finally…)
 Who else has trash junkboxes that keep on crushing it?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[tldr: Set environment variable MESA_LOADER_DRIVER_OVERRIDE=i965 on /etc/environment
 ​
 Hello! I'm making this post in case someone out there, like me, is having trouble with the HD Graphics 520 crashing when under heavy load and hopefully this might also work for other iGPUs suffering from the same issue.
 Usually when doing GPU heavy tasks, your desktop might freeze for a few seconds or even crash the entire session (if you're unlucky). You'll get an error like this one on dmesg:
 i915 0000:00:02.0: [drm] GPU HANG: ecode 9:1:85dffffb, in Xorg [2300]
 For me this only happens when using the Iris driver which is the default for my card, changing it to the old i965 driver seems to not only have fixed the issue but reduced GPU usage when OBS is running.
 The only thing you'll need is to set an environment variable: MESA_LOADER_DRIVER_OVERRIDE
 Open the file /etc/environment as root with any text editor (with sudo nano or sudo vim) and add this to a new line: MESA_LOADER_DRIVER_OVERRIDE=i965
 This will set the variable for every user on the machine (at least on Ubuntu 22.04) so that anyone logging into any session will be using the old driver instead of the Iris one.
 Now log off and log back in and hope it fixes the problem for you. This works with both X.Org and Wayland. This variable can also be set individually for any applications that might have problems with the Iris driver like SDL-only PPSSPP.

 When I started with Linux I used to write everything that I downloaded so when my system crashed and I did not find how to repair it, I would reinstall it. The list was beneficial. I decided why not make a script in my dotfiles so that when I was installing Linux to some other PC It would be really easy to run just one command and everything will be installed automatically. Maybe you did that, too. However, let me share it, and let's help some who did not think of this.
 Here is the repo:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Python's formatted strings, or "f-strings", came relatively late to the
language, but have become a popular feature.  F-strings allow a compact
representation for the common task of interpolating program data into
strings, often in order to output them in some fashion.  Some
restrictions were placed on f-strings to simplify the implementation of
them, but those restrictions are not really needed anymore and, in
fact, are complicating the CPython parser.  That has led to a Python
Enhancement Proposal (PEP) to formalize the syntax of f-strings for the
benefit of Python users while simplifying the maintenance of the
interpreter itself.]]></summary>

        <updated>2023-01-10T20:29:25.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In the first part of the series we have talked generally about what are namespace and what we can do with them - in case you want to go over it you can use the following link https://medium.com/@boutnaru/linux-namespaces-part-1-dcee9c40fb68. Now we are going to deep dive into the IPC (inter process communication) namespace.
 The goal of the IPC namespace is to isolate between different IPC resources like message queues, semaphores and shared memory. We are talking both on System V IPC objects (https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/sysvipc.7.html) and POSIX message queues (https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/mq_overview.7.html). In order to use “IPC namespaces” the kernel should be compiled with CONFIG_IPC_NS enabled (https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/ipc_namespaces.7.html). 
 We can use “/proc” in order to retrieve information about the different IPC objects in an “IPC namespace”. Regarding POSIX message queues we have “/proc/sys/fs/mqueue”. In case of System V IPC objects we have “/proc/sysvipc” and specific file in “/proc/sys/kernel” (msgmax, msgmnb, msgmni, sem, shmall, shmmax, shmmni, and shm_rmid_forced). For more information I suggest reading proc’s man page (https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man5/proc.5.html). 
 Lastly, all IPC objects created in an “IPC namespace” are visible only to all processes/tasks that are members of the same namespace - as shown in the screenshot below. In the demonstration the namespace was created using “unshare” (https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/unshare.1.html), the IPC resource was created using “ipcmk” (https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/ipcmk.1.html) and the show information about System V IPC resources using “ipcs” (https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/ipcs.1.html).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[First, Fedora just breaks VAAPI encoding without providing a workaround first, as if no one needed that on production. Then, other distros followed but at least some of them provided alternative solutions.
 Now OBS just released an update that REMOVED VAAPI from the Flatpak. For a software that relies so much on hardware encoding (even with the bad Linux support they have), an issue like this should be something that all devs must think before doing. Flatpak can use runtimes, so if the runtime they use breaks the program then don't update the runtime.
 Meanwhile Windows users got new hardware encoding options that actually work. I don't get why we started this journey against the desktop Linux right when it was getting somewhere.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In late 2021, LWN covered a plan to
eliminate the Python global interpreter lock (GIL), thus improving the
language's thread-level concurrency.  This plan has now been codified as PEP 703, which includes
an extensive discussion of the changes that would be made.


	The global interpreter lock will remain the default for CPython
	builds and python.org downloads. A new build configuration flag,
	--without-gil will be added to the configure script that
	will build CPython without the global interpreter lock.


The posting of a PEP is only one step in a long path toward integrating
this change into the CPython interpreter; expect some extended discussions
over the coming months.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I worked for Apple many years ago, and due to this have ended up with many old PowerPC & 68k Macs in my possession. I’ve dutifully moved them from place to place over the years, mostly due to my desire to not seem them end up in a landfill, but I’d like to actually utilize at least a few of them. 
 Most are laptops, like a PowerBook 100 and a few of those colourful, toilet-seat-shaped iBook G3’s, but I also have some desktop machines that I believe still have some useful life left in them, but MacOS abandoned them decades ago, in most cases. 
 If I wanted to resurrect these old dinosaurs with a passably-modern, Linux-based OS, what distribution would you suggest I look at first? I’m more concerned about the PowerPC machines, but I’d also love some advice about the Motorola 68k machines. 
 Thanks in advance for any guidance you’re able to provide.
 EDIT: I’ve fallen into that age-old trap of using the word ‘Linux’ as a catch-all that just means “Unix-like FOSS Operating System”. My bad; I’ll try to do better in the future:) It’d definitely be at least slightly better/easier for me overall if it were truly Linux-based, but I’m not averse to looking into BSD; I had already anticipated that this project would involve building quite a great deal of what I want from source anyway.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[这是一篇快速而简单的指南，用 Oh My Zsh 和 Powerlevel10k 主题改造你的 Zsh 终端 Shell，使其在 Ubuntu 和其他 Linux 发行版中看起来很酷。




大多数 Linux 发行版中的默认 Shell 是 Bash。Bash 是一个可靠的和传统的工具。然而，它缺乏一些自定义功能，比如漂亮的颜色、光标支持等等。

你可以使用另一个 Shell，即 Zsh 来得到更多的设置调整，并帮助你扩展你的 Bash Shell 体验。

这个简单的指南解释了如何安装 Zsh、Oh My Zsh 并应用 Powerlevel10k 主题。

Oh My Zsh 和 Powerlevel10k 安装和配置指南

1、安装 Zsh 和改变 Shell

打开一个终端，使用以下适用于你的发行版的命令安装 Zsh。

Ubuntu、Debian、Linux Mint 和所有相关的发行版：

sudo apt install zsh


Fedora：

sudo dnf install zsh


Arch：

pacman -S zsh


安装完成后，找出 Zsh 的安装路径：

whereis zsh


然后使用当前用户的 Zsh 可执行路径改变 Shell。

chsh -s /usr/bin/zsh <用户名 >




关闭并再次打开终端。然后你应该看到 Zsh 的首次设置。选择选项 2。它将用一个默认的主题改变你的 Shell 提示符的外观，如下图所示：



2、安装 Oh My Zsh

Oh My Zsh 是一套可以进一步定制 Zsh 的脚本。

首先，我们将从 GitHub 上下载 Oh My Zsh 脚本来安装它。如果你有 wget 和 git 软件包，那就最好了。如果还没有…]]></summary>

据报道，微软已经讨论在 Word、PowerPoint、Outlook 等应用程序中加入 OpenAI 的人工智能，以便客户能够使用简单的提示自动生成文本。这一举措可能会改变超过 10 亿人编写文档、演示文稿和电子邮件的方式。工程师们正在开发在客户数据上训练这些模型的方法，并保证这些数据不会泄露给其他客户或落入不良分子手中。


消息来源：The Information



老王点评：让我想一下，或许以后可以就写个提纲，Word 就可以替你补充大段看起来没什么问题的文字？这简直是灌水的福音。




艺术家担心 Adobe 追踪其设计过程来训练 AI

前两天我们 报道 过，Adobe 创意云服务的隐私条款让用户担心其创作被用来训练 Adobe 的生成性 AI。这一讨论在 Twitter 上吸引了数百万次浏览和数千次转发。但是除了对图像、音乐、视频等创作被利用的担心之外，艺术家们还担心 Photoshop 和其他 Adobe 产品追踪其应用的使用，以了解创作者是如何工作的。也就是说，窃取平面设计师在几十年的工作中形成的流程和行动。一个复杂、曲折的艺术过程变得有可能被自动化。


消息来源：Fast Company



老王点评：如果是真的，那么平面设计师或艺术家们也将很快被人工智能取代。我们说的 AI 的消息够多了，总感觉我们处在 AI 爆发前夜，或许明天一切你想得到、想不到的工作都会因 AI 而改变。




动态三重缓冲有望加入 GNOME 44

两年多来，Canonical 一直在为 GNOME 桌面的 Mutter 合成器研究动态三重缓冲。这种按需的三重缓冲可以极大地提高桌面性能，特别是在使用英特尔集成显卡和树莓派板卡的情况下。虽然三重缓冲的实现还没有被上游化，但从 Ubuntu 22.04 LTS 开始就把这些补丁作为他们发行的 Mutter 包的一部分，Debian 等发行版也一直携带该补丁。开发人员表示动态三重缓冲有望会被 GNOME 44 上游纳入。GNOME 44.0 稳定版将于 3 月 22 日发布。


消息来源：Phoronix



老王点评：这对低性能显卡真是一件好事。相比 GNOME、KDE 的各种花哨改进，我更愿意看到它们在性能和稳定性等底层的进展。]]></summary>

滋贺秀三（1921-2008）

在社会正常运转、一切相安无事或者按部就班的情况下，秩序或社会秩序是一个不被意识到的抽象概念。一旦出现如大面积传染病造成的连锁性社会危机，或因特定要素发生战争之类的冲突，社会秩序、维持秩序的诉求和努力、秩序的力量等观念、需求、实体组织与支撑要素以及复杂的结构立即凸显出来。凡事有例可依，顺理成章就是秩序状态或者社会秩序化的结果，意味着背后的社会习惯、规则、制度以及支撑这些习惯、规则、制度正常运转的文化价值、意识形态和相关社会组织系统的复合性力量持续发挥作用。
为构建一个井然有序的社会，无论是站在政治顶端的当权者，怀抱修齐治平理想的官僚与学者，还是负有家族村社之责的家父长与村野长老，在思想文化、制度规则、组织人事、社会习惯与风俗方面作了千年以上的努力。但是中国文明得以绳绳不绝，其秩序究竟是以什么原理，按照什么规则构建、维持？制度、规则通过什么层级、组织系统来执行，底层社会的纠纷经过什么样的环节与政治、社会性权力系统的介入获得解决？即社会秩序的制度结构与实际运用等问题，是致力于传统中国制度史与法制史学者具有魅力的研究领域。
在学术上专门讨论这些问题的中国法制史学科的形成与发展过程中，日本的东洋法制史学具有非常重要的位置。立基于近代人文社会科学理论与方法的中国历史学和法制史学始于二十世纪初，在构建中国历史学与法制史学框架的过程中，日本的“东洋史”与“东洋法制史”学者在某种意义上具有奠基之功。在中国法制史学领域，如果说宫崎道三郎与中田薰的开拓性研究处于草创期，那么仁井田陞以唐律令的复原与解释为出发点，承接了宫崎与中田等的成果，比较系统地展开了中国法史学研究，拓宽了中国法制史领域，滋贺秀三则是其后日本中国法制史研究的代表性学者。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[这里是一个关于理解 Linux 中 who 命令的初学者指南，并带有几个例子。


这篇文章是 Linux 命令学习系列的一部分。

who 命令

Linux 中的 who 命令用于显示当前登录到系统中的用户的信息。它显示用户的登录名，用户登录的终端，用户登录的时间，以及远程主机名（如果有）。

语法

下面是 who 命令的基本语法：

who [OPTION]... [ FILE | ARG1 ARG2 ]


各种 who 命令和开关的例子

默认情况下，who 读取文件 /var/run/utmp，其中包含当前登录的用户的信息。如果没有指定选项，它会显示每个用户的登录名、终端和登录时间。

who


它给出了以下输出。你可以看到它显示了登录名是 debugpoint，终端 ID tty2 和登录的日期和时间。

debugpoint tty2 2023-01-01 11:22 (tty2)




然而，如果你在虚拟机中运行上述命令，你应该看到同样的情况，但终端 ID 将是 x11 服务器的显示名称，即 :0。

❯ who
debugpoint :0 2023-01-01 23:36 (:0)


要显示当前用户的用户名和信息，使用下面的方法：

whoami


使用 -b 选项查看最后一次系统启动时间：

❯ who -b
system boot 2023-01-01 23:36


显示当前系统中登录的用户数：

❯ who -q
debugpoint
users=1


所有上述命令与 -H 选项配对时，你会有一个更好的含标题行的信息，如下所示：

who -H

NAME LINE TIME COMMENT
debugpoint tty2 2023-01-01 11:22 (tty2)


如果你想在 Linux 中显示与 who 命令有关的所有信息，请使用选项 -a：

who -aH

NAME LINE TIME IDLE PID COMMENT EXIT
system boot 2023-01-01 11:19
run-level 5 2023-01-01 11:19
debugpoint + tty2 2023-01-01 11:22 13:26 2042 (tty2)


像往常一样，你可以使用下面的重定向将 who 命令的输出保存到任何文件：

who > user_details.txt


who 命令选项的例子总结

下面是一些 who 命令的例子和它们的解释：

下面是一些可以与 who 命令一起使用的选项：


-a: 显示每个用户的主机名、登录时间和进程

-b: 显示上次系统启动的时间

-d: 显示死进程（已终止但未从 utmp 文件中删除的进程）

-H: 显示标题行

-l: 显示长格式的登录进程

-m: 只显示在 ARG1 ARG2 指定的终端上登录的用户的名字和行。

-q: 显示已登录用户的数量

-u: 显示拥有未脱离进程的用户的信息

-w: 显示已经登录的用户信息，格式与 utmp 文件相同


总结

我希望这篇文章能够帮助你了解 who 命令及其基本原理。你也可以阅读 who 手册页来了解更多。如果你有任何问题，请告诉我。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[引言

2022 年末，openEuler Summit 2022 上，中国 Linux 内核圈最有影响力的开发者之一——吴峰光博士做了名为《面向全场景操作系统的构建服务发布》的主题演讲，正式向开发者披露了 openEuler 统一构建服务 EulerMaker。

Linux 中国开源社区就此采访了吴峰光博士，为读者挖掘到一些在峰会上亮相的 EulerMaker 背后的有趣细节。


💡 吴峰光博士是著名的 Linux 内核贡献者、华为计算操作系统首席专家、openEuler 社区技术委员会委员。他在 Linux 内核领域上拥有卓越贡献，在 I/O 和内存管理、内核测试服务方面做出了重要的贡献。有关他的故事，可以参阅《新程序员》杂志的专访《吴峰光杀进 Linux 内核》。


openEuler 的全场景

2021 年 9 月，openEuler 宣布将支持全场景，在服务器、云计算之外，还支持编译计算和嵌入式场景，这就引来了很多人的关注，但也有一些怀疑的眼光。因为，服务器和嵌入式分处两端，中间有着巨大的鸿沟。

“30 年前，服务器 OS、嵌入式 OS，界限非常清晰，像是两个村，中间全是农田。但后来 IT 越来越深入千行百业，云、边缘、IoT 兴起，各种场景涌现，发生了交叠。所以我们认为这是一个新的历史机会，来做一个全场景 OS。”吴峰光说。


💡 关于多场景的支持和融合，请参考我们之前对欧拉技术委员熊伟的采访：《操作系统专家解读 openEuler 22.09 最新技术特性》。




“要做全场景 OS，就引入了一个需求：原来的构建系统，如何转化为全场景统一构建系统？”

什么是 OS 构建系统？

OS 构建系统以 OS 源代码作为输入，以用户可安装使用的软件仓或OS镜像作为输出。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[苹果公司宣布，近期购买并激活新iPhone或iPad的新订阅用户，可免费获取6个月iCloud+服务。符合该优惠条件的设备是指2023年1月1日起，在中国大陆范围内，从苹果官方或其授权经销商处购买，并已经运行iOS 14或iPadOS 14系统的新iPhone或iPad。简而言之，就是今年1月之后购买激活iPhone或iPad的用户。


虽然苹果提到“现有iCloud+付费用户无法享受此优惠”，但其实“停用 iCloud+ 服务三个月以上的原订阅用户也可享受这一优惠”，也就老用户停用一段时间也可以享受优惠。


符合条件的用户在激活设备48小时内会在系统内收到推送通知，在90天内点击即可兑换优惠。


6个月免费期结束后，iCloud+订阅将按中国大陆地区当前定价自动续订。用户在结束前取消订阅即可。


iCloud是苹果自有的私有云空间服务，2011发布。它将苹果的不同硬件和软件与云端数据结合，可在云端存储照片，应用，日历，文档等数据，并通过Apple ID自动同步。起步是免费的5GB空间。并具备200GB——2TB等不同容量的收费档位。


2021年6月，苹果在其全球开发者大会上宣布，iCloud正式升级为iCloud+品牌，同时更加强调用户隐私保护。


相比iCloud，“iCloud+”服务具有更多进阶功能，如“隐藏邮件地址”和 HomeKit 安防视频支持。此外，用户可通过家人共享与家庭成员共享最大2TB的存储空间。


这是苹果尝试将其硬件+服务绑定的新尝试，此前，Apple Music也有类似活动。让新用户免费体验一段时间的苹果流媒音乐服务。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have been a fan of Linux for years but I'm not too knowledgeable about computer hardware. I understand the basic concept of ram but this seems like a big change to how its partitioned maybe? I'm really curious about what this will change in Linux that's supposed to make it better than before substantially.

Feel free to ask any question about it, it's hard to describe what it is all about in a single blog post. For examples of a more complex code I recommend looking into to the "src" directory in the SDK. And here are some documentation links:

 What Is An ABI and Why Is It So Complicated
 Flatpak Is Not The Future
 This is a manifold problem that involves many actors and subsystems - compiler settings, target architecture, distro defaults, Unix conventions.
 I am wondering what is your feeling about the future of Linux distros with regard to executable portability. Is Flatpak the lesser evil? Is it a second edition of the LBS agreements? Will containers or virtualisation eventually turn this problem obsolete? Are executable specifications maybe floating up onto some abstraction layer that can eventually turn into an standard?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[smenu is a powerful visual selection tool for the terminal, originally created to make menus, hence its name.
 smenu makes it easy to navigate and select words from stdin or a file using a friendly user interface. The selection is printed to stdout for further processing.
 Tested on Linux and FreeBSD but should work on other Unix as well.
