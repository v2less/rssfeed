 As you may know, we went dark for over a week to protest a recent change announced by reddit.
 Here is a link to what is happening and why we went dark: https://www.reddit.com/r/ModCoord/comments/1476fkn/reddit_blackout_2023_save_3rd_party_apps/
 ​
  
Apollo made 7 billion requests last month, which would put it at about 1.7 million dollars per month, or 20 million US dollars per year. Even if I only kept subscription users, the average Apollo user uses 344 requests per day, which would cost $2.50 per month, which is over double what the subscription currently costs, so I'd be in the red every month.
  
We have received a message from the Admin team basically demanding that we stop the protest of the recent API changes or we will be removed: https://i.imgur.com/s7kM6j5.png
 The mod team is currently discussing ways to continue participating in the API protest without putting the subreddit at risk. A few ways that other subreddits have implemented are:
  
One day a week blackouts
 
Banning a specific letter and removing posts/comments that include that letter
 
Marking the subreddit as NSFW since this is all motivated by maximizing advertising revenue for their upcoming IPO
 
 ​
 The list of demands that need to be addressed as a result of this change: https://www.reddit.com/r/ModCoord/comments/148ks6u/indefinite_blackout_next_steps_polling_your/jo0pqzk/
 Please share your feedback and any suggestions you may have for showing our support to 3rd party apps and scripts that will be negatively impacted by this API change.

Or running a restaurant without looking at the price of your ingredients. Or constructing homes without looking at the price of raw materials... you get the idea.
That lack of transparency would be frightening, but hey, things could still work out, right?
Well, let's up the difficulty.
Imagine that, on top of not knowing exactly how much you were paying for your inputs, you also didn't know if you would have consistent and continued access to your wholesaler, your food supplier, or your building materials. That would almost certainly induce high blood pressure, stomach ulcers, and mild insomnia.

We built Autolabel because access to clean, labeled data is a huge bottleneck for most ML/data science teams. The most capable LLMs are able to label data with high accuracy, and at a fraction of the cost and time compared to manual labeling. With Autolabel, you can leverage LLMs to label any text dataset with https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36409201

is handled by the stable maintainers or the developers of the fixes.
However, due 
to some unhappiness in the XFS development
community with the process of handling stable fixes for that filesystem,
a different process has come about for backporting XFS patches to the
stable kernels.  The three developers doing that work, Leah Rumancik, Amir
Goldstein, and Chandan Babu Rajendra, led a plenary session at the 
2023 Linux Storage, Filesystem,

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[谷歌警告员工不要使用 Bard 生成的代码

谷歌对外宣传 Bard 有助于开发者提高工作效率，但它对内警告员工不要使用 Bard 生成的代码。谷歌解释称，它的内部使用禁令是因为 Bard 会产生不需要的代码建议，潜在会导致程序出现错误或过于复杂，软件过于臃肿，相比不使用 AI 辅助编程需要更多时间修复。该公司表示，它的目标是对其技术的局限性保持透明 —— Bard 会提出不想要的代码建议，但它还是有助于程序员。


消息来源：路透社



老王点评：合着还是拿用户做小白鼠啊，所以你放心使用 AI 生成的代码用在生产环境吗？




Reddit 抗议活动仍在继续中

上周一二，Reddit 版主们为了抗议 Reddit 的 API 定价政策而宣布关闭他们管理的子区，最高时期超过 90% 的子区变成了私有或限制发帖状态。直到一周后，仍有三千多个子区继续抗议，但最大的一些已经重新开放，不过这些子区将他们的抗议改为到张贴喜剧演员约翰·奥利弗的照片，“所有帖子都必须是约翰·奥利弗看起来很性感的图片”。Reddit 声称，它做出 API 价格改变是为了从 AI 需求中获利，AI 可以利用其托管的内容进行大型语言模型训练。


消息来源：The Register



老王点评：即便是迫于 IPO 压力，但我说，Reddit 这件事办的很糟糕，最后很可能是两败俱伤的结果。




Meta 宣布危险到不能公布代码的语音生成 AI 模型

Meta 公司昨天宣布了一个名为 Voicebox 的新人工智能模型，它说这是迄今为止功能最全面的语音生成器，“但由于滥用的潜在风险”，目前没有公开提供 Voicebox 模型或代码。该模型仍然只是一个研究项目，Meta 公司说它可以从短至两秒的样本中生成六种语言的语音，未来可用于 “自然、真实” 的翻译等方面。


消息来源：The Verge



老王点评：当一个 AI 已经不能被人类或 AI 识别时，很可能带来的风险超过收益。]]></summary>

KDE Plasma 桌面环境如今已经成为数百万用户的选择。借助活跃的开发者和社区的支持，它不断改进并推出与技术潮流相符的新功能。经过多年的发展，KDE 技术现在已经能够运行在桌面、笔记本电脑、平板电脑、手机和手持游戏设备上。这对于一个桌面环境来说是非常令人惊叹的，不是吗？

我经常听到或读到 KDE 桌面的各种问题，或者与 GNOME 相比被认为它的“选项太多”。我同意这些观点。但是我们不能忽视一个事实，尽管有这些争议和不同看法，KDE Plasma 桌面环境仍然是任何个人或企业使用场景的首选解决方案之一。它有一个成熟的路线图，采用独特的 Qt 技术构建，甚至能够在汽车和其他平台上运行。此外，它还有一个专门的基金会，拥有大量开发者，每天在努力改进这个桌面环境。

这就是为什么我撰写这篇文章的目的。有数百种 Linux 发行版支持 KDE Plasma 桌面环境。但是应该选择哪一个呢？它们各自有什么优势和劣势？哪一个对我来说最好？我们将在本文中尝试回答所有这些问题，并帮助你自行做出决策。

KDE Plasma 桌面的十大 Linux 发行版

我基于使用情况而非技术术语（如安装、终端使用等）编制了以下列表。

1、Kubuntu



Kubuntu 是 Ubuntu Linux 操作系统的官方 KDE Plasma 桌面版本。它使用与 Ubuntu 相同的基础软件包，并遵循 Ubuntu 的发布计划。这意味着它在 Ubuntu 发布新版本时也会发布新版本。由于基于 Ubuntu，你可以享受到伴随 Kubuntu 版本的庞大的帮助和支持社区。Kubuntu 是…]]></summary>

《郑孝胥日记》，中华书局1993年10月版

郑孝胥，字苏戡，一字太夷，因居所名曰“海藏楼”得号海藏，常以号行。福建闽侯人，生于苏州，长于福州。中国近现代著名诗人、书法家和政治家。1882年福建乡试解元，长期佐幕张之洞，备受器重。1903年两广总督岑春煊委为洋务处督办、营务处总办，驻军龙州，筹粮饷，开银号，办教育，卓有建树，允文允武，诚人生得意之秋，旋于1905年辞归上海。1911年诏任湖南布政使，未到任而清已亡，遂成为海上坚定的逊清遗老。1923年经陈宝琛引荐，入故宫任懋勤殿行走，1924年再任总理内务大臣，1925年任张园行在总务处总管，1932年伪满洲国成立后出任国务院总理兼文教部总长，走上“不归之路”，最后于1938年病死长春。
闽人闽菜，理所当然
郑孝胥在上海近二十年，从事路矿、金融、新闻、出版等事业，并多年担任商务印书馆董事长，其间诗酒风流，与遗老唱和，与时贤周旋，特别是组织或参与壬午同年会、一元会、消寒会等雅集活动，对我们了解早期闽、川菜馆在上海的发展及其与上海文化建设的关系，大有裨益，因为这是郑氏宴集最主要的两帮菜馆；之所以闽、川菜馆合论，则是因为早期上海闽菜与川菜风格特色相近，最典型的就是消闲别墅的菜品，常在闽川之间游移，以致时人莫辨，各种指南录之类书籍，便干脆标为闽川菜馆。
郑孝胥第一次在上海上餐馆，是1883年3月8日，进京赴试，经上海：“往滋卿处，同至聚丰园，邀叶小莱舅翁饮。”（引自《郑孝胥日记》，中华书局1993年10月版，以下引用该著不另出注）这聚丰园，从其新张开业广告来看，最初可能是家京菜馆：“启者：本园开设上洋四马路，精制满汉大菜、挂炉猪鸭、透味油鸡，四时佳肴，预定包办。外国大菜，一切鲜品，不另细载。谨择四月初一日开（业）。”（《新开聚丰园》，《申报》1877年4月30日第6版）后来杭州袭名而开的聚丰园正是京菜馆兼营番菜，适成佐证…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[文档查看器是每个 Linux 发行版的必备软件，可以用来阅读 PDF 等格式的文件。

Ubuntu 等发行版上的文档查看器一般是 GNOME 中的 Evince（LCTT 译注：读作 /ɪˈvɪns/）。Evince 支持多种文件格式，非常方便。

但是除了 Evince，还有很多其他的文档阅读应用。比如 Linux 上优秀的电子书阅读应用 Foliate（LCTT 译注：读作 /ˈfəʊlɪɪt/）。

最近我又发现了另一个文档查看器：Zathura。

用 Zathura 获得摆脱鼠标的阅读体验

Zathura 是一个高度可定制的文档查看器，基于 girara 用户界面 和几个文档库。girara 实现了一个简单、最小的用户界面。

Zathura 的加载速度极快。它极其简约，没有侧边栏、菜单栏等元素。（LCTT 译注：其实 Zathura 的界面没有那么单一，按 Tab 键可以显示索引页；Zathura 有一个 guioptions 选项来设置是否显示命令行、状态栏、水平滚动条、垂直滚动条等 GUI 元素。）



按 : 键可以打开 Zathura 的命令行提示符，按 Esc 键可以退出命令行。

如果要新建书签，可以输入 :bmark 后面跟想要对这个书签设置的索引号。



按 F 键可以高亮所有链接，每条链接附带一个序号，并且界面底部会显示命令行提示符。在命令行中输入链接对应的序号，按下回车可以用系统默认的浏览器打开该链接。



Zathura 还支持自动重新载入。如果文件被其他应用修改（LCTT 译注：比如在修改 LaTeX 源文件并重新编译得到新的 PDF 之后）， Zathura 会自动重载修改后的文件。

你还可以安装 插件 来扩展 Zathura 的功能，比如阅读 漫画comics 或 PostScript 文件。

the launch of a new web site

	Some of my criticisms focused on the message: fsf.org and gnu.org

	inaccessibility which makes it difficult for new participants to

tool that has many users today can easily be eclipsed by something better
next week.  Even in this environment, though, some programs endure for a
long time.  As an example, consider the
PostgreSQL database system, which traces its
history back to 1986.  Making fundamental changes to a large code base
with that much history is never an easy task.  As fundamental changes go,
moving PostgreSQL away from its process-oriented model is not a small one,
but it is one that the project is considering seriously.]]></summary>

I’m Julien and I built a recommendation engine for Hacker News.
I feel like this website is a gold mine. Every day, I find some very interesting stories about a topic. And sometimes, I want to find other stories covering that same topic but I can’t.
Hacker News has years of history of awesome discussion and ressources. Unfortunately, I think HN Algolia isn’t helpful in searching these old threads. As a student, I want to learn a lot from this website.
This is why I created HN Recommend. Input a sentence or the URL of an article, and get the most popular and similar posts from Hacker News.
About the technical details, I've computed the embeddings of over 100,000 articles from HN and indexed it using Faiss. I made a blog post for a deeper explanation.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[PostgreSQL 超过 MySQL 成为开发者首选数据库

Stack Overflow 2023 年 5 月的调查显示，45.55% 的受访者使用 PostgreSQL，而 MySQL 为 41.09%，SQLite 为 30.9%。三年前，同样的调查中，MySQL 占 55.6%，PostgreSQL 占 36.1%。需要注意的是，这是一个开发者调查，它并不反映生产中的使用情况。此外，微软的 SQL Server 是排名最高的全商业数据库引擎，使用比例为 25.45%，比 2020 年的 33% 有所下降。


消息来源：Dev Class



老王点评：其实 PostgreSQL 在特性方面一直比 MySQL 好，但是这十多年来就一直被 MySQL 压着打。我接触的第一个开源数据库是 PostgreSQL 而不是 MySQL。现在似乎 MySQL 有点颓势了，而 PostgreSQL 多年的坚持得到了开发者们的认可。如果你是开发者，你会考虑选择哪个呢？




红帽准备开发 CentOS Stream 10

根据红帽工程师分享的 Fedora Enterprise Linux Next（ELN） 计划，推出 CentOS Stream 10 的进程正在进行中，这将最终形成 Red Hat Enterprise Linux（RHEL）10 的基础。预计将在 7 月把所有 Fedora ELN 内容大量导入 CentOS Stream 10。CentOS Stream 的目标是在明年 2 月的 Fedora 40 之前，不与 Fedora 分叉。预计 RHEL 10 将在 2025 年发布。


消息来源：Phoronix



老王点评：无论如何，我都觉得红帽放弃 CentOS 的战略是一大败笔，至少这件事可以做的更好。当然，任何决定背后都有其根本利益的驱动，红帽这样做无可厚非，只是如今这个局面可能是他们最初也没预料的吧。




英特尔简化其 CPU 品牌组合

英特尔已经宣布从下一代 Meteor Lake CPU 开始对其处理器品牌进行一些改变。最小的变化是，英特尔的主流 CPU 将失去其 “i”，从 Core i3/i5/i7/i9 转变为简单的 Core 3/5/7/9。英特尔还将停止在其处理器品牌中使用 “代” 的信息 —— 不会有被宣传为 “第 14 代” 的新 CPU，但会在 CPU 编号中包含世代编号。这是英特尔处理器品牌战略更广泛调整的一部分。去年，该公司放弃了低端笔记本电脑 CPU 的奔腾和赛扬品牌名称，它现在将这些英特尔处理器称为英特尔处理器。


消息来源：Ars Technica



老王点评：这些 CPU 厂商的命名真是有点随意，编号和实际的技术有时候有点脱节。]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[如果你正在找寻适合你的系统的完美发行版，那么选择基于 Ubuntu 的发行版的可能性非常高。

你可能会问为什么。

嗯，毫不奇怪，Ubuntu 是 最适合初学者的 Linux 发行版之一。它也非常流行，这就是为什么你会发现它拥有庞大的用户社区。不仅如此，它还广泛用于 云服务器 上。

因此，将 Ubuntu 作为 Linux 发行版的基础应该带来一些有用的优势，对吧？

这就是为什么我列出了基于 Ubuntu 的最佳发行版清单，希望你能找到一款足够出色，让你停止频繁更换发行版的选择。

1、Ubuntu 官方衍生版



如果你不喜欢 Ubuntu 官方提供的 GNOME 桌面环境，你可以尝试官方衍生版，它们在 Ubuntu 的基础上提供了不同的桌面环境。

简单来说，你将得到同样的 Ubuntu 使用体验，但拥有不同的用户界面。

为了让你的用户体验更加愉快，这些桌面环境已经进行了预调整和主题设置，这使它们成为了那些希望拿来即用的完美选择。

以下是可用的选项：


Kubuntu（KDE Plasma）

Lubuntu（最节约资源的选择，使用 LXDE/LXQT）

Ubuntu Studio（面向创作者的发行版）

Ubuntu Budgie（Budgie 桌面环境）

Ubuntu Kylin（专为中国用户定制）

Ubuntu MATE（使用 MATE 桌面和工具）

Xubuntu（Xfce 桌面）


此外，你还可以在 Ubuntu 22.10 中发现一个带有经典 Unity 桌面环境的新的官方衍生版，因为 Ubuntu Unity Remix 现已成为官方 Ubuntu 衍生版。


解析：我应该使用哪个 Ubuntu 版本？



Ubuntu 衍生版


2、Linux Mint

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[帕斯卡（尼克绘）

帕斯卡（Blaise Pascal）生于1623年6月19号，死于1662年8月19号，只活了三十九岁。十七世纪是所谓“天才的世纪”，弗朗西斯·培根死的时候，帕斯卡刚刚三岁；开普勒出版《世界的和谐》时，帕斯卡四岁；伽利略出版《两大世界的对话》时，帕斯卡九岁；霍布斯和伽利略在佛罗伦萨第一次见面时，帕斯卡大概十一岁。帕斯卡比他的法国同胞梅森（Marin Mersenne，1588生）、笛卡尔（1596生）、费马（1607生）以及英国人霍布斯（1588生）、意大利人托里拆利（1608生）晚一辈，又比牛顿（1642/1643生）和莱布尼兹（1646生）早一辈。和他同代的人有英格兰人沃里斯（1616生）和洛克（1632生）、荷兰人惠更斯（1629生），还有塞法迪犹太人斯宾诺莎（1632生）。1607年徐光启回上海老家守丧，三年后回京，利玛窦已逝，只翻译了六卷的《几何原本》就此搁置。徐光启死时，帕斯卡十岁。 
帕斯卡的父亲热爱数学和科学，在帕斯卡十一岁时去掉官职（一说卖掉一说让给弟弟），定居巴黎。帕父和神父出身的数学家梅森交好，梅森家是巴黎学者们聚会的沙龙，帕斯卡父子是常客。梅森府也被称为巴黎邮政局，因为他通过通信和欧洲的一百四十位数学家和科学家保持联系，研究成果到他这里汇总，再被他广播出去。梅森认为知识应该被广泛传播，这点和培根相似——中世纪教会保留的学术传统是知识应该保密，一元三次和四次方程的求解历史反映了当时数学家之间为了保密而引发的各种勾心斗角。梅森的通信网络也称“梅森学院”（Mersenne Academy），后来演变成非正式的“巴黎学院”，是法国科学院的前身。 

梅森

帕斯卡有个姐姐吉尔伯特，比他大三岁。她非常疼爱自己天才的弟弟，在帕斯卡死的当年，写过一本五十页的帕斯卡传记《帕斯卡先生的一生》，她的孩子们也努力维护舅舅的名声。帕斯卡有个妹妹雅克琳，比…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[这是一个新教程系列的开始。在这一篇中，你将熟悉 bash 脚本。


本系列假定你对 Linux 终端比较熟悉。你不必精通，但了解基础知识会很好。我建议阅读终端基础知识系列。

这个系列适合谁？

任何想开始学习 Bash Shell 脚本的人。

如果你是一名将 Shell 脚本作为课程的一部分的学生，那么本系列适合你。

如果你是普通的桌面 Linux 用户，本系列将帮助你了解在探索各种软件和修复程序时遇到的大多数 Shell 脚本。你还可以使用它来自动执行一些常见的重复性任务。

到本 Bash 基础系列结束时，你应该能够编写简单到中等水平的 Bash 脚本。

该系列的所有章节都有示例练习，你可以边做边学。


🚧 你将在这里学习 Bash Shell 脚本。虽然还有语法基本相同的其他 Shell，但它们的行为在某些方面仍然存在差异。Bash 是最常见和通用的 Shell，因此学习 Shell 脚本从 Bash 开始吧。


你的第一个 Shell 脚本：Hello World！

打开一个终端。现在 创建一个新目录 来保存你将在本系列中创建的所有脚本：

mkdir bash_scripts


现在 切换到这个新创建的目录：

cd bash_scripts


让我们在这里 创建一个新文件：

touch hello_world.sh


现在，编辑该文件 并向其中添加一行 echo Hello World。你可以使用 cat 命令的追加模式（使用 >）执行此操作：

[abhishek@itsfoss]:~/bash_scripts$ cat > hello_world.sh 
echo Hello World
^C


我更喜欢在使用 cat 命令添加文本时添加新行。

按 Ctrl+C 或 Ctr…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[众包工人用 AI 为 AI 做数据标注工作

AI 模型是建立在人类劳动的基础之上的，高质量的数据标注对 AI 模型至关重要，AI 公司通常会雇佣廉价的众包工人做一些数据标注工作。但研究显示，随着 AI 聊天机器人，如 ChatGPT 的流行，众包工人开始利用 AI 做这些数据标注的工作。瑞士洛桑联邦理工学院的研究人员招募了 44 名众包工人来对 16 篇医学研究论文总结摘要，根据记录的击键情况，比如按下复制快捷键等，他们估计有 33-46% 的摘要文本是用 AI 生成的。


消息来源：The Register



老王点评：还记得前两天我们的#1032 期报道吗，显然这种 AI 吃 AI 的狗粮的事情已经在发生，并且会越来越多。而且，AI 真的能分清楚哪些是 AI 生成的么？可能会越来越难。




FreeBSD 本月庆祝其三十岁生日

1993 年 6 月 19 日，从 386BSD 项目中分裂出来的 FreeBSD 正式有了这个名字。但第一个正式版本直到 1993 年 11 月才发布。FreeBSD 14 将于未来几个月后发布，晚于预期计划。


消息来源：FreeBSD



老王点评：虽然不如 Linux 那么流行，但是 FreeBSD 仍然是一个独特而重要的操作系统。当然，这里面故事很多，感兴趣的朋友可以了解一下。




GPT-4 生成的商业计划书更受投资者青睐

虽然用 AI 撰写商业计划书能节约很多时间，但更重要的是，AI 撰写的比人类撰写的更好，更吸引投资。有公司邀请了数百名投资者和企业主对一组由人类创造和 GPT-4 生成的商业计划书进行评分，他们并不知道有 AI 参与撰写。而且，其中人类撰写的计划书来自于已经获得融资的成功案例。结果显示 GPT-4 生成的商业计划书比人类更有效，被认为在质量、关键要素描述和问题描述上胜过人类。调查显示，在投资者和企业主阅读了 GPT-4 的计划书之后，投资可能性为人类的三倍，他们认为 AI 生成计划书的说服力是人类的两倍。


消息来源：ZDNet



老王点评：投资人可能会想，那我为什么不直接投资 AI 创建的企业呢？这一天或许不远了。]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[胡晓江（章静绘）

胡先骕（1894-1968）先生是中国植物学的奠基人，在中国近代科学史上具有重要地位，同时也是中国近代文学史上的重要人物，在新文化浪潮汹涌澎湃的年代，他始终坚持文化保守主义的立场，创作了大量诗词古文。此外，他还是一位教育家和有高度责任感的社会评论家。2023年5月24日，时值胡先骕一百三十岁虚岁诞辰，《胡先骕全集》在国家植物园举行了首发式。《全集》主编、北京师范大学教授胡晓江是胡先骕的孙女。在接受《上海书评》专访时，她讲述了《全集》的编纂过程，并对祖父胡先骕的生平及学术做了介绍。

《胡先骕全集》（共十九卷），江西人民出版社2023年5月版

能请您聊聊《胡先骕全集》的缘起吗？
胡晓江：《全集》是从2014年启动的。胡先骕是1894年生人，2014年是他的诞辰一百二十周年，江西师范大学举办了很大规模的“胡先骕教育思想研讨会”。江西师范大学是国立中正大学的“嫡传”，胡先骕是中正大学的首任校长。在会议期间有人提出，是时候为胡先骕编一部《全集》了。当然，这并非一时兴起，而是早已有了积累。对胡先骕有一点了解的人，都知道胡先骕不仅是一位科学家，还特别能写，他写诗、写文学批评、写社会评论，身后留下了很多文字。所以，对他的文章著作的搜集、整理，以及对他生平的研究，从上世纪八十年代就已经开始了。最早是中正大学在台湾的校友谭峙军先生，他对老校长念念不忘，晚年花了很多时间搜集、整理胡先骕发表在各处的诗词。在胡先骕百年诞辰的时候出版了《胡先骕先生诗集》（中正大学台湾校友会，1992年）。后来，胡先骕的另一位学生张大为和我的大伯父胡德熙、我父亲胡德焜一起，编了两卷本《胡先骕文存》（江西高校出版社，1995、1996年）。此外，学者胡宗刚在他担任研究员的庐山植物园发现了很多与胡先骕相关的档案资料，在此基础上做了很多研究，写了传记《不该遗忘的胡先骕》（长江文艺出版社，2005年），…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[你的笔记本电脑就像一块空白的画布，可以用来展示个性化的装饰。你最喜欢的贴纸是什么？参与我们的调查，然后看看其他开源爱好者都说了些什么。


去年 12 月刚刚换了工作用的笔记本电脑后，我意识到我有多么喜欢给我的工作设备贴贴纸。这些贴纸有些是过去活动的纪念品，有些是我热衷的项目的标志，还有一些则只是为了好玩！

因为好奇别人的笔记本上贴了什么，我对周围的同事朋友问了一圈。

无障碍倡导者



这是我的工作笔记本电脑（你能看出我对 Drupal 的热爱吗）。我最喜欢的贴纸是有轮椅的 Druplicon... 当 Drupal 8 发布时，我们把这个标志 和轮椅结合在一起，因为我所在的机构专注于无障碍性。

— AmyJune Hineline

充满活力的 Java



自从我还是个孩子的时候，我的电脑和其他东西上就一直有贴纸。我认为我最喜欢的要么是 “Tux”，要么是 “Linux Inside”。它们大多与领域相关，只有一些不相关的。在右下角，我有一个运行在“汤姆猫”上的 Java 贴纸（哈哈）- 这是我职业生涯中花费大部分时间的领域。

— Alan Formy-Duval

实用目的



嗯，我没有贴任何贴纸。然而，我在我的两台笔记本电脑上粘了绒面条，用来固定我的移动硬盘，这样我在公交车上玩游戏时就不会掉落了。我还粘了一个锁槽。

— Rikard Grossman-Nielsen

保持外观



虽然这不是最装饰得最多的笔记本电脑，但我喜欢这套集合（你知道的，很难在没有旅行的情况下获得更多！）

我最喜欢的是“最后一个提交的人是维护者”。这是对维护状态的讽刺性评论，也承诺代码将因此而继续存在。

主要是关于我使用或贡献的事物，我认为有意义，或者只是觉得这个贴纸很棒。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[出于研究目的需要下载 YouTube 视频吗？ Tube Downloader 可以提供帮助。




找到了你想要保存以供离线使用的 YouTube 视频，同时又想不选择他们的付费计划？

好吧，那么你可以使用 Tube Downloader。它是 “yt-dlp” 的前端，提供了一些简洁的功能。


🚧 未经许可下载 YouTube 视频是违反平台政策的。因此，这些工具在官方商店中不可用。我们不鼓励你将该工具用于非法目的，仅提及该工具用于研究和实验目的。


Tube Downloader：概述 ⭐



Tube Downloader 主要使用 C# 编写，是一个跨平台的开源工具，可让你轻松直接从 YouTube 下载视频。

请允许我向你展示此应用的功能。

当你启动应用时，“添加下载Add Download”按钮会显示一个友好的问候语。单击它以添加 YouTube 视频 URL，然后单击“验证Validate”。



当你这样做时，你将看到用于选择文件格式、质量、字幕、保存位置等的选项。


📋 你可以选择 MP3 作为仅下载音频的文件格式。


单击“下载Download”开始下载视频。



你会在主页面上看到下载进度，你可以在其中看到视频的标题以及 URL 和下载速度。

此外，Tube Downloader 在下载完成时显示通知； 但是当我测试它时，它有点不稳定。



那不是全部。Tube Downloader 也有一些不错的自定义选项，例如：


适配系统主题。

在后台运行。

能够限制最大并发下载量。

设置下载速度限制。

选择使用 “Aria2” 作为替代下载器。

启用/禁用在下载的视频中包含元数据。

停止/重试所有下载并清除所有排队的下载。




这些可以从功能区菜单下的“首选项Preferences”访问。

看到 Linux 客户端工作得相当好，Tube Downloader 对于下载那些令人上瘾的快乐的猫咪模因和其他东西是很有用的 🐱 （我们不做评价）。

📥 获取 Tube Downloader

Tube Downloader 可在 Linux 和 Windows 中的 Flathub、Snap 商店 和 微软商店 中获取 。


Tube Downloader（Flathub）


你还可以在 GitHub 上查看其源代码。

你想知道我从 YouTube 下载了哪些视频吗？ 🤔好吧，你可以在我们的 YouTube 频道 上查看这些内容。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[英特尔开始出货量子处理器

这个名为 Tunnel Falls 的处理器是一款 12 量子比特的芯片，虽然远远落后于英特尔的许多竞争对手的量子比特数量，但英特尔正试图建立基于硅的量子比特，而其它的量子处理器厂商都在通过云服务提供量子处理器。这些量子比特基于“量子点”，这些结构比材料中的电子波长还要小。量子点可以用来捕获单个电子，然后可以处理电子的特性来存储量子信息。英特尔利用其制造专长来制作量子点，并创造出设置和读取其状态以及执行操作所需的所有邻近功能。


消息来源：Ars Technica



老王点评：居然可以像民用芯片一样销售了？我感觉量子时代或许来的比我想象的要早。




谷歌利用 YouTube 开发其下一代人工智能

据透露，谷歌的研究人员一直在利用 YouTube 开发其下一个大型语言模型 “双子座Gemini”，该模型展示了在其他任何模型中都看不到的多模态能力。而 OpenAI 也已经秘密地使用了 YouTube 的数据来训练其一些人工智能模型，但谷歌能够拥有 YouTube 更全面的视频数据。人工智能开发者在寻找用于训练和改进模型的高质量数据方面面临着新的障碍。从 Reddit 到 Stack Exchange 再到 DeviantArt 的主要网站出版商正越来越多地阻止开发者为该目的下载数据。


消息来源：The Information



老王点评：人工智能下面一个竞争优势就是，看谁拥有大量的数据。所以，我有点明白 Reddit、Twitter 为什么要对其 API 收高价了，可能广告的流失可能并不是主要的原因，因为这种情况并不是第一天存在了。




Meta 公司希望人们能利用其开源人工智能赚钱

Meta 公司正在研究如何将其开源的大语言模型的下一个版本用于商业用途，他们希望其他公司自由使用 Meta 正在开发的新人工智能软件并从中获利，这一决定可能会对其他人工智能开发者和越来越多地采用它的企业产生重大影响。随着开发者采用和改进这些 Meta 开源的模型或修补其安全漏洞，Meta 也将能够把这些改进纳入其自己的消费者和广告产品的人工智能模型中。


消息来源：The Information



老王点评：Meta 公司显然是走一条弯道超车的方法，走开源的路，让其它人无路可走。]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[软件自由保护协会Software Freedom Conservancy（SFC）是一家由开源倡导者组成的非营利性社区。今天（本文原文发表于 2022 年 7 月 5 日），它发布了一篇抨击性的博文，宣布退出 GitHub，并请求其成员及支持者公开谴责该平台。SFC 与 GitHub 的如此纷争，源于这一颇受指责的举动：微软和 OpenAI 训练了一个名为 Copilot 的 AI 系统，而其训练数据的来源，是那些使用了开源许可证公开的代码。开源代码不是捐款箱，不是想拿多少就拿多少，想怎么用就怎么用的。

它更像是摄影作品。即便摄影师没有向你收取照片的使用费，你仍需要在该署名的地方进行署上来源。据 SFC 的一篇 博文 所述，Copilot 在使用他人的代码片段时，并没有保留来源信息：

“这反映了 GitHub 长期以来的问题，也是我们必须一齐放弃 GitHub 的关键原因。从 Copilot 中，从 GitHub 的代码托管服务中，从我们所见的基本每个领域，我们都发现 GitHub 的行为比其同行要差得多。我们也不相信 Amazon、Atlassian、GitLab 等其他盈利性的代码托管平台，能有杰出的表现。然而，将 GitHub 的行为与其同行相对比较一下，就能发现 GitHub 的行为要差得多了。”

GitHub 是全世界事实上的开源代码仓库。它是 YouTube、Twitter 和 Reddit 的混合体，但专为程序员及其代码服务。自然，替代品是有的。但是，从一个代码仓库生态切换到另一个，并不等同于用 Instagram 来替代 TikTok。微软在 2018 年花了 70 多亿美元来收购 GitHub。从那时起，微软就利用其 OpenAI 的主要受益者的地位，来共同开发 Copilot。并且，要访问 Copilot 服务，只能通过微软的特别邀请，或者支付订阅费。该举激怒了 SFC 及其他开源倡导者，因为微软和 OpenAI 实际上在将他人的代码货币化，同时让使用这些代码的人们不能正确地表明归属信息。

Copilot 必须毁灭。或者，微软和 OpenAI 可以造一台时光机，然后穿越到过去，将 Copilot 数据库中的每一点数据做标记，从而能够为所有输出提供正确的署名。但是，与其去关心你产品或者服务中的伦理问题，不如去鼓动人们，去开拓那荒野西部似的监管环境，后者总是更加简单的。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[pipx 解决了流行的 pip 工具的不足之处。学习在 Linux 中安装和使用 pipx。


pip 是一种流行的工具，用于从 Python 包索引 中安装 Python 包和模块。

然而，在最近的发行版本中，pip 用户遇到了 外部管理环境错误。



这是为避免通过 pip 安装的 Python 包与本机包管理器之间发生冲突而添加的“功能”。Python 希望你使用单独的虚拟环境，而不是通过 pip 在全局安装包。

这就是 pipx 发挥作用的地方。它为你安装的每个应用创建一个新的虚拟环境，然后在全局级别的 /bin 中创建到本地二进制文件的链接。这一切都是自动的。它为你节省时间和精力。

让我们看看如何在 Ubuntu 和其他 Linux 发行版上安装和使用 pipx。

在 Ubuntu 和其他 Linux 上安装 pipx

安装很简单，可以在 Ubuntu 和 Debian 上使用以下命令安装：

sudo apt update && sudo apt install pipx


对于其他发行版，请使用你的包管理器并安装它。

完成安装后，将其添加到 $PATH 以便可以从任何地方访问它：

pipx ensurepath




关闭终端并重新启动它。这就完成了！ 现在，让我们看看如何使用它。

使用 pipx

包管理器的主要用途是什么？ 软件包安装、更新和删除。

让我向你展示如何使用 pipx 执行以下操作：


搜索包

包安装

升级

包移除


让我们从安装开始。

如何使用 pipx 安装包

要使用 pipx 安装包，你必须遵循一个简单的命令语法：

pipx install <package_name>


例如，在这里，我安装了一个非常有用的程序 Cowsay：

pipx install cowsay




同样，如果你想安装特定版本的包，你必须在 == 后跟上版本号，如下所示：

pipx install package==version


例如，在这里，我安装了 1.24.1 版本的 numpy：

pipx install numpy==1.24.1




如何搜索包

pipx 程序没有搜索功能（因为 PyPI 的 API 使用限制）但这并不意味着你不能搜索 Python 包。

要搜索包，你需要安装 pypisearch：

pipx install pypisearch


完成后，你可以使用 pypisearch 命令搜索包：

pypisearch python_package_name


在这里，我搜索了 neofetch：



如何使用 pipx 升级包

与任何其他现代包管理器一样，你可以一次升级所有包，也可以一次升级一个包。

要一次升级所有软件包，你只需执行以下命令：

pipx upgrade-all




如你所见，它将 numpy 升级到最新版本。

但是如果你想升级一个特定的包，你可以这样做：

pipx upgrade package-name


假设我想将 cowsay 包升级到最新版本，那么，我将使用以下命令：

pipx upgrade cowsay




如何使用 pipx 卸载包

要删除包，你必须使用 uninstall 标志，如下所示：

pipx uninstall package_name


为了供你参考，在这里，我从我的系统中删除了 numpy：

pipx uninstall numpy




pip 还是 pipx？

对 pip 的限制影响了最终用户对它的使用。值得庆幸的是，pipx 提供了急需的替代方案。它符合使用虚拟环境的 Python 准则，同时允许已安装的应用在全局范围内可用。

对于不是 Python 应用开发的最终用户，这提供了使用发行版仓库中不可用的 Python 应用的选项。

希望本教程对你有所帮助。如果你有任何问题或建议，请告诉我。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The bcachefs filesystem, and the
process for getting it upstream, were the topics
of a session led remotely by 
Kent Overstreet, creator of bcachefs, at the 
2023 Linux Storage, Filesystem,
Memory-Management and BPF Summit.  He has also discussed bcachefs in
previous editions of the summit, first
in 2018 and at last year's event;
in both of those cases, the question of getting bcachefs merged
into the mainline kernel came up, but that merge has not happened yet.
This time 
around, though, Overstreet seemed 
closer than ever to being ready to actually start that process.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Reddit 威胁换掉继续抗议的子区管理员

本周初，数千 Reddit 子区 闭版 以抗议 Reddit API 的天价收费，因为这事实上扼杀了管理员们赖以执行管理操作的第三方客户端。Reddit CEO 对员工 表示 不要担心，因为抗议不会影响公司收入。他称，“大部分子区会按计划在周三回归，我们干好自己的工作就行了”。周三，部分子区陆续恢复，但也有很多子区将继续保持关闭 —— 直到 Reddit 改变其政策。目前还有超过一半的子区保持关闭或限制，这包括订阅数超过四千万的 r/funny、超过三千万的 r/aww、r/Music 等。此外，Reddit 还威胁将移除继续抗议的管理员。Reddit 宣称，如果一个子区的管理团队一致同意停止管理社区，它将邀请愿意管理社区的新管理员来管理社区；而如果至少有一名管理员愿意维持社区运作，Reddit 将移除不想管理社区的管理员。


消息来源：Hacker News



老王点评：真是要硬扛到底啊，这不是移除几个“刺头”管理员就能解决问题的，相信这样的抗议也代表了大部分社区中坚的意见。无论如何，这都是一幕罕见的大规模社区对抗事件，让我们拭目以待。




YouTube 通知其开源替代品 Invidious 关闭

Invidious 是 YouTube 的一个开源 “替代前端”，允许用户在没有数据跟踪的情况下观看 YouTube 视频，也可以让用户在观看视频时不被 “恼人的广告” 打断。YouTube 声称该软件违反了其 API 政策，称它没有显示 YouTube 服务条款的链接，也没有 “明确” 解释其对用户信息的处理。YouTube 要求它在 7 天内关闭。


消息来源：VICE



老王点评：看来开放 API 将全面进入关闭时代，各个网站都开始扼杀这些妨碍其广告业务的客户端了。或许在官方看来，这些利用其 API 的第三方客户端就是在对它们吸血。




Alphabet 出售了谷歌域名产品

Alphabet 正在结束其谷歌域名业务，并将其资产以约 1.8 亿美元的价格出售给 SquareSpace。这些资产包括“在谷歌域名业务上托管的 1000 万个域名，分布在数百万个客户中”。谷歌域名业务于 2014 年推出，在 2022 年退出了测试阶段。它拥有诸多新的顶级域名，是 HTTPS 的主要支持者之一。


消息来源：9to5google



老王点评：谷歌连域名这么重要的基础设施服务都开始砍掉，以后还能信任谷歌在基础设施方面的持续性么？]]></summary>

任何一个转弯都可能引向天堂
或者，任何角落都可能隐藏着地狱
道路闪亮，像雨后上山的河流。
——爱德华·托马斯
1914年12月至1917年1月，在战争的阴霾下，爱德华·托马斯（Edward Thomas）用生命的最后两年时间创作了他一生的诗篇。1917年1月13日，托马斯写下最后一首诗《真爱的悲哀》，两周后，他作为英国皇家炮兵部队少尉赴法国前线。4月9日，在阿拉斯（Arras）“复活节反攻”时被德军炮弹击中身亡。托马斯的一百四十二首诗作在其身后结集出版，被认为是那个时代最伟大的诗歌成就之一。作为十六位战争诗人之一，他的名字被镌刻在伦敦西敏寺诗人角的一块纪念碑上。
爱德华·托马斯生于1878年，十九岁出版第一本散文集《林地生活》。到1914年，在成为诗人之前，他已是著名散文家、传记作家和深具影响力的文学批评家，被《泰晤士报》称为“拥有英格兰诗歌天堂钥匙的人”。那一时期，托马斯还实验性地创作了冥想散文、印象派小说、神话、奇幻故事与寓言，他的写作实践几乎涵盖了所有的文学体裁，如果不是过人的文学禀赋，他或许也会以纯粹的博物学家、自然学家、地形学家、民俗学家或社会历史学家的身份来写作。托马斯广泛而独到的评论遍及自乔叟时代到他同时代的文学作品，既以非凡的洞察力评论同时代作家（哈代、叶芝、劳伦斯、庞德等），也敏锐地倾注于当时名不见经传的文学新人。他第一个意识到威廉·亨利·戴维斯（W. H. Davies）、德拉梅尔（Walter de la Mare）和弗罗斯特的诗歌才华。他积极评价戴维斯的处女作，并鼓励他写下在北美的狂野经历《一个超级流浪汉的自传》，这本书被出版商拒绝，托马斯帮助获得萧伯纳的前言，助力出版；托马斯在评论弗罗斯特的《波士顿以北》…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[在 Linux 中无法打开 AVIF 图片？AVIF 是一种新的网络图像文件格式，下面是在 Linux 桌面上查看 AVIF 图像的方法。


就质量而言，PNG 是最好的，但它们体积庞大，因此不适合用于网站。

JPEG 会减小文件大小，但会显着降低图像质量。

WebP 是一种相对较新的格式，可以生成尺寸更小、质量更好的图像。

现在，AVIF 是一种新的文件格式，可以在不牺牲质量的情况下压缩图像。对于相同的图像质量，它们比 WebP 更小。

最近 Linux 已开始提供 WebP 支持。但是，许多发行版默认不支持 AVIF 图像格式。

如果你从网络上下载 AVIF 格式的图像，它不会显示缩略图。



如果你尝试使用默认图像查看器打开它，它很可能会显示“无法识别的图像文件格式”错误。



那么，解决方案是什么？ 在 Linux 上根本看不了 AVIF 图像吗？

不，事实并非如此。对于 Linux，总有一种解决方法。

在 Linux 中查看 AVIF 图像文件

有一个名为 gThumb 的便捷 图像查看器，可用于在 Linux 上打开 AVIF 图像。

如果不是全部的话，它应该在大多数 Linux 发行版的仓库中可用。

在 Ubuntu 和基于 Debian 的发行版上，使用以下命令安装 gThumb。

sudo apt install gthumb




安装后，选择一张 AVIF 图像，右键单击它并选择“打开方式Open With”选项。在这里，选择 gThumb，将其设为 AVIF 图像的默认值并打开它。



gThumb 在打开的图像下以缩略图格式显示同一文件夹中的所有图像。



使用 gThumb 打开 AVIF 图像后，它们也应该以缩略图显示。



就是这样。你现在可以在 Linux 桌面上欣赏 AVIF 图像。

总结

gThumb 是一个用途极为广泛且功能强大的应用。这让我想知道为什么它不被用作 GNOME 或其他桌面环境和发行版中的默认图像查看器。

关于 Linux 中默认的 AVIF 支持，迟早会添加。目前，gThumb 完成了这项工作。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[我们将介绍一些最佳的虚拟化程序，为用户创建/管理虚拟机提供便利。


虚拟化软件由于其用途和好处而广泛使用，你可以使用它来体验、测试或运行需要特定操作系统版本的软件。

虚拟化提供了一个抽象的计算机硬件概念，帮助你创建虚拟机（VM）、网络、存储等。其好处包括隔离性、安全性和自由度高，可以尽情测试各种事物。

不同类型的虚拟化软件分别适用于桌面用户、服务器管理员和企业用户。

在列出各种虚拟化软件的同时，我还会提到适用对象。

1、VirtualBox



VirtualBox 是一款备受赞誉的开源虚拟机程序，适用于 Linux、Windows 和 macOS。

它适用于各种类型的用户，无论你只是想在虚拟机上运行 Linux，还是想创建一个用于测试的虚拟机，或者是企业需要一个虚拟机解决方案。

对大多数用户来说，它可以被视为一个全能解决方案。虽然它主要适用于桌面使用，但你可以尝试其无头headless模式，通过查阅其 文档，将虚拟机作为远程桌面服务器运行。

主要亮点：


支持广泛的客户操作系统

简单的用户界面和快速的性能

定期更新

功能丰富


2、OpenVZ



想在服务器上创建隔离的 Linux 容器吗？OpenVZ 可以帮助你。

你可以创建行为类似于独立服务器的容器。这些容器具备帮助你高效管理的所有基本功能。

由于 OpenVZ 是作为 Linux 发行版构建和分发的，因此容器仅运行于 Linux 上。

对于初学者来说，OpenVZ 是学习使用容器的绝佳选择，因为它易于配置和管理。此外，与其他一些方案相比，基于 OpenVZ 的 VPS 托管价格实惠。

主要亮点：


资源利用效率高

使用和管理简单


3、KVM

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[安卓开源项目将不是一个完整的开源移动操作系统

安卓开源项目（AOSP）是安卓系统开源的部分，但谷歌不断地将其中一些部分抽取到其私有的谷歌服务框架。最近，谷歌又废弃了 AOSP 中的拨号和消息应用程序，谷歌称，“这个应用程序没有得到积极的支持，其源代码只作为参考。这个项目将在未来的某个时候从源代码清单中删除。”虽然每个安卓 OEM 厂商都已经使用了他们自己的拨号和消息应用，而且也有比谷歌更好的开源替代品，但对于安卓这个开源操作系统来说，由于 AOSP 的功能不断地被转移到闭源的谷歌服务框架中，你将不能说 AOSP 是一个完整的开源移动操作系统了。


消息来源：OS News



老王点评：从谷歌删除“不作恶”信条那时起，开源就不断被它践踏。当然，这并不是谷歌做的有多差，或者违背了开源许可证，在这方面比它差的比比皆是。叹息的是，终究很多公司只是将开源当成一件需要利用时披上的华丽衣服，而在金钱当道时就如旧衣一样丢弃。




Debian 13 将支持 RISC-V 64

Debian 12 已经正式发布，官方支持 AMD64、AArch64、i386、POWER 等架构，但不支持 RISC-V 64 位。不过，对 RISC-V 64 位的移植正在取得良好的进展。在一年半到两年后的 Debian 13 版本中，预计会有对 RISC-V 64 位的支持。考虑到许多社区开源开发者缺乏高性能 RISC-V 硬件，这也是可以理解的。


消息来源：Phoronix



老王点评：如果 Debian 能够支持高性能 RISC-V 架构，将从根本上推动 RISC-V 的发展。




生成型人工智能每年可为全球经济增加 4.4 万亿美元

麦肯锡公司称，生成性人工智能每年可为全球经济增加 “2.6 万亿至 4.4 万亿美元”。这几乎是 “相当于在地球上增加一个规模相当于英国的新国家（其 2021 年 GDP 为 3.1 万亿美元）”。这一数据比该公司在 2017 年的预估上调了 15% 至 40%。生成性人工智能和其他技术有可能使工作自动化，但麦肯锡认为这并不意味着大规模的工作流失，而是“使这些工作的执行速度大大加快”。麦肯锡发现，主要受到影响的工作任务是客户运营、市场和销售、软件工程和研发等工作。


消息来源：Venture Beat



老王点评：虽然如此说，但是一些人失业是不可避免的，就看谁能适应。可以预期的是，人工智能鸿沟会进一步拉大社会差距。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[与你最亲近的人建立一种开放的文化，并带着它走遍天下。


作为 80 年代的叛逆少年，“因为我这么说”是我在家里经常听到的一句话。我并不是一个真正的叛逆者。我只是想让别人听到我的声音，把我看成是一个开始表达自己想法和情感的人。

我那种不被倾听/聆听的感觉让我相信，培养不害怕说话的孩子很重要，但他们也能学会适应。倾听他们的意见，与孩子们合作，也可以帮助他们发挥创造力，最终让他们成为成功组织的一部分。

孩子们如何解释信息

我并没有刻意鼓励孩子们的开放行为，也没有主动告诉孩子们要大声说话。尽管如此，在我大儿子上幼儿园的第一天，他的老师给我们打电话。她告诉我们，当她和全班同学一起讨论不打架、不推搡等规则时，我的孩子举手告诉她，他的父母允许他一直争论和辩论。

这是真的。我让我的孩子们表达自己的意见，并让他们听到。但我孩子的话让我感到惊讶。直到那时我才意识到，虽然我一直在做正确的事情，但事实上，我的孩子们的行为不应该只是对我们教育他们的方式的反应。我们也不应该让他们从二手语境中挑选东西。那一天对我来说是一个游戏规则的改变，践行开放的文化正式主动地进入我们的家庭。

为成长而开放

在我小的时候，父母和长辈是有知识的人。

作为一个孩子，要获得信息并不容易。虽然我被鼓励表达意见，但也只是到了一个规范的、“容易消化”的程度。今天，父母、老师和孩子都有同样的手段来获取数据。你如何处理它，完全取决于你。

例如，在用希伯来语玩 Scattergories 时，“病毒”一词通常是大多数人玩的唯一以 “V” 开头的生物。为了获得更多的分数，我们决定寻找其他符合条件的动物名称。不一会儿，我们就找到了不是一种而是三种新的生物（我孩子的老师认为“小袋鼠”（希伯来语中以 “V” 拼写）不是一种真实的东西，但这是另一个故事）。

我教我的孩子阅读字里行间的内容，决不要不加质疑地接受作为“事实”呈现给他们的东西。这使他们能够练习批判性思维。这也使他们能够质疑我，从而使我们进行公开和透明的讨论。

这些讨论容易吗？不是。我总是有精力进行这些讨论吗？绝对不是。

然而，为了帮助他们练习学会倾听的“肌肉”，这些对话是必须的。

偶尔，我们必须强迫自己找到时间，把注意力集中在家庭上。建立一个强大而开放的文化需要时间，随着人们的变化，你的家庭文化也在变化。你必须适应并努力保持它的活力。作为群体的领导者，我必须为我的孩子们提供一个安全的地方，一个他们可以公开分享自己想法的地方，一个他们有归属感的地方。

在一个家庭中，你们必须合作，共同解决问题。倾听不同的想法和解决问题的方法可以让你想出创造性的（但并不总是符合每个人的喜好）解决方案。

我家里的一个问题是玩电脑游戏时家里的噪音。这种情况大多发生在深夜和周末。我们一起坐下来，想出了一个商定的嘈杂游戏的时间段。从那时起，那些想玩的人知道他们什么时候可以玩，而那些寻求一些安静时间的人也知道这些时间会发生什么。随着孩子们的长大，决定和讨论的性质也发生了变化。

这是否意味着所有的决定都与孩子们分享？不。这是否意味着都是玫瑰花？绝对不是。

鼓励孩子们建立联系可能会以一个破花瓶告终，似乎没有人对此负责。这可能会导致“因为我这么说”来拜访。然而，进行具有挑战性但又具有包容性的对话、鼓励创新思维以及让孩子参与决策都是让他们为成年做好准备的方法。希望它也能让他们成为更好的人（到目前为止，以我的拙见，这运作良好）。

开放的家庭文化

实行开放的文化不是一次性的事情。它是一个旅程，也是一种心态。我相信它为我和我的孩子们提供了工具，使他们在屋内和屋外都能坚韧不拔、思想开放、宽容和充满好奇心。与你最亲近的人建立一种开放的文化，并带着它走遍天下。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[在 Rust 系列的 上一篇文章 中，我介绍了如何使用 if 和 else 关键字来处理 Rust 程序的控制流。

这是处理程序控制流的一种方法。另一种方法是使用循环。因此，让我们在本文中看看循环。

Rust 中可用的循环

Rust 编程语言有三种不同的循环，基于你想要实现什么以及可用的内容：


for

while

loop


我假设你对 for 和 while 已经很熟悉了，但 loop 对你来说可能是个新概念。让我们先从熟悉的概念开始。

for 循环

for 循环主要用于迭代一种称为迭代器的东西。

这个迭代器可以从任何东西中创建，从数组、向量（很快就会介绍！）、一系列值，或者任何自定义的东西。这里的可能性是无限的。

来看看 for 循环的语法。

for 迭代变量 in 迭代器 {
    <语句>;
}


其中的 迭代变量 在大多数其他编程语言教程中通常被称为 i ; )

迭代器 可以是任何东西，只要它能告诉下一个值是什么，如果有的话。

来通过一个程序来理解这个。

fn main() {
    let my_arr = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9];

    println!("迭代数组");
    for element in my_arr {
        println!("{}", element);
    }

    println!("\n迭代一个真正的迭代器");
    for element in my_arr.iter() {
        println!("{}", element);
    }

    println!("\nPython 风格的范围");
    for element in …]]></summary>

东南亚华人华侨的历史久为学界关注，从最早的经济行为入手，继而政治意义、文化衍变传承以及身份认同等各方面都有了优秀的专著和研究文章。并且，在“南洋”这个大的地域概念之下，逐渐细分出不同国家/地区华人华侨在历史上的差异化发展沿革。比如笔者博士求学期间主要研究的新加坡/马来亚华人华侨，和工作后所在泰国的华人华侨，不论是早期华侨时代还是演变至今的华人华裔，都呈现出迥异的生存状态以及认同。李欣祥先生这本《消逝的海外华邦：西婆罗洲华人政权的兴亡》从兰芳公司（1770-1884）这个领域内都有所耳闻的“华人海外共和国”入手，对西婆罗洲曾存在过若干华人政权的缘起、发展和灭亡做了详细的介绍与分析，并试图讨论这些政权尤其是兰芳公司在整个华人历史中可能扮演过的重要且独特的先驱角色（兰芳公司的名称之争历来已久，本文采纳李欣祥先生在书中的叫法，写作兰芳公司）。由于西婆罗洲现今华人群体式微，相关的研究工作不曾大规模开展过，而李欣祥先生将他之前的累积做了一个更有深度和广度的延伸，把西婆罗洲存在过的华人公司作为整体研究对象撰写了《消逝的海外华邦》，为那段西婆罗洲华人公司及政权的历史刻下了重要的印记。
公司（kongsi）还是共和国——如何定义西婆罗洲的华人政权
作者给这本书的题目起得很巧妙，用了“华邦”这个词，因为对兰芳公司的定性几十年来一直有所争议。以荷兰学者高延为代表的一部分学者认为，兰芳公司的领袖大统制角色近乎共和政体下的总统，甚至发展出自己类似议会的议政制度，加上拥有武装力量、税收政策以及对外关系，尤其当时的清政府并没有承认和兰芳的从属关系，完全可以被视作一个独立的国家，所以兰芳公司当之无愧可以被称为“兰芳共和国”。但还有一部分学者认为，兰芳公司并没有脱离东南亚华人群体中“公司（ko…]]></summary>

乔治·杜比（Georges Duby ）等主编的《女性史·20世纪卷》（原书名A History of Women in the West, Volume V : Toward a Cultural Identity in the Twentieth Century，1992）虽然是三十年前出版的著作，但是我认为在关于二十世纪女性史的研究中该书至今仍然具有重要的权威性，其敏锐的问题意识和开阔的研究视角及方法远未过时。进入二十一世纪以来的性别史、妇女史以及在各种历史研究议题中性别研究视角的研究成果无疑非常丰富，但是在通史、国别史、全球史、跨国史比较研究等整体性层面上的女性研究地位仍远未取得转向性的成果。仅此而言，可以说在历史学科的整体性建构中仍有亟需填补的空缺，而《女性史》在整体性历史研究的面向中，其性别化的研究视角和以性别体系为中心的强调差异性、动态性的方法论无疑仍然具有开拓性的意义。更重要的是在有关二十世纪的女性史叙事中，该书从不同视角揭露了存在于所有社会结构中的性别权力压迫的普遍性，也揭示了在国家主义、民族主义等意识形态制约下的民族国家建构中的性别压迫的复杂性和微观过程。同时，作者们以大量史实和性别理论阐释提醒人们反思和警惕所谓二十世纪的女性故事在本质上是一个进步故事、二十世纪是女性进步时代的断言。该书通过整体性的历史研究揭露和反抗一切性别权力压迫，使女性史研究成为审视历史、理解现实和面向未来的一种有效的方式，我认为是这本女性主义历史叙事著作最值得阅读的理由。
乔治·杜比与米歇尔·佩罗（Michelle Perrot）为这套多卷本《女性史》撰写的“总序：书写女性的历史”的第一句话就是：“长期以来，女性都屈身于历史的阴影之中。”这里的“历史的阴影…]]></summary>

at the advantages and disadvantages of how documentation for PostgreSQL
is written.


	The strengths of this process are also its weaknesses. A developer
	is, by definition, someone who spends the majority of their time
	doing development, which is to say writing code. Updating the
	documentation becomes a task that must be completed so that the
	code one has written can get committed so that one can move on to
	the next project and write some more code. If a change to the
	documentation would be beneficial but is unrelated to any
	particular patch, it's not likely to get done.

	The results are, in a certain sense, pretty comical.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[6 月 14 日消息，在 2023 开放原子全球开源峰会上，阿里云公布 1+4 开源战略，在操作系统、云原生、数据库、大数据四大开源领域之外，AI 模型社区魔搭作为大模型方向的开源新势力首次亮相。据悉，目前已有 15 款支持中文的开源大模型在魔搭社区上线。



开放原子开源基金会是我国首家开源基金会，于 2020 年 6 月在北京成立，由阿里等多家科技企业联合发起，主管单位为工信部。今年，阿里云首次将魔搭社区（ModelScope）带到开放原子全球开源峰会这一顶尖开源大会上。

去年 11 月，阿里与 CCF 开源发展委员会联手推出魔搭社区，初衷就是通过开源开放、共建社区生态的方式，让 AI 开发使用更简单。魔搭社区践行模型即服务（Model as a Service）（MaaS）新理念，提供多类优质 AI 模型以及模型调优、训练、部署等一体化服务，旨在降低AI模型应用门槛。

经过半年左右的发展，魔搭已经成为国内规模最大、最活跃的 AI 模型开源社区，开发者数量超 160 万，模型下载量超 2500 万，累计开源开放了 900 多个优质 AI 模型，包括阿里通义大模型系列、澜舟科技的孟子模型、智谱 AI 的中英双语千亿大模型等 15 款支持中文的开源大模型。魔搭社区现已成为中国 AI 模型开源第一门户。未来，魔搭社区将继续帮助开发者将 AI 模型转化为生产力，持续推动 AI 领域的开源生态建设。



阿里云是开源的受益者，也是积极贡献者。在操作系统领域，阿里云、统信软件等联合发起的龙蜥社区已成为国内领先的操作系统开源社区。在云原生领域，阿里云的开源项目覆盖容器调度、微服务、分布式应用治理等多个重要领域。在数据库领域，阿里云核心产品 PolarDB 数据库 PostgreSQL 版和分布式版已经开源。在大数据领域，Flink 是当下被广泛使用的开源大数据计算引擎之一。

三年来，阿里云一直积极参与开放原子开源基金会建设，积极向基金会捐赠开源项目。龙蜥操作系统在 2021 年 10 月进入基金会孵化流程；阿里云倡议发起云原生工作委员会后，双方就 ACK Distro 和云原生应用脚手架两个开源项目达成捐赠意向。此外，阿里云还深度参与建设了 AtomGit 代码协作平台。

开放原子开源基金会副理事长、阿里云市场总裁刘湘雯在会上表示，未来阿里云将持续拥抱开源生态，持续投入 AI、云原生、数据库、大数据、操作系统等领域的开源工作，持续提升开发者服务和企业创新支持，为开源创新提速。]]></summary>

上周伊朗军方展示了其海军大学开发的“量子处理算法”的首款产品，它能帮助军方探测水面的扰动。但通过媒体公布的“量子”设备图像的分析显示，该设备可能是一款在亚马逊上出售的 FPGA 开发板 ZedBoard，在图像上甚至可以清晰地看到该品牌名。ZedBoard 开发板主要是用于视频处理、可重构计算、电机控制、软件加速等用途，并不具有“量子比特”。

人工智能对人工智能生成的内容进行训练将导致人工智能崩溃

用于训练大型语言模型的数据最初来自人类来源，如书籍、文章、照片等，这些都是在没有人工智能的帮助下创建的。但随着越来越多的人使用人工智能来制作和发布内容，一个明显的问题出现了：当人工智能生成的内容在互联网上扩散时，人工智能模型开始对其进行训练。研究人员发现，“在训练中使用模型生成的内容会导致所产生的模型出现不可逆转的缺陷。”他们研究了文本到文本和图像到图像的人工智能生成模型的概率分布，得出结论：“从其他模型产生的数据中学习会导致模型崩溃 —— 这是一个退化的过程，并且随着时间的推移，模型会忘记真正的基础数据分布。”他们观察到模型崩溃发生得如此之快：模型可以迅速忘记它们最初学习的大部分原始数据。这导致它们随着时间的推移，表现越来越差，错误越来越多。


消息来源：Venture Beat



老王点评：这让我想起了衔尾蛇，一种自己吞噬自己尾巴的蛇。这样下来人工智能失去对世界的真正认知，我们的未来或许再也分不清现实和人工智能虚构的“现实”。




Meta 开源了音乐和图像模型

Meta 公司开源发布了自己的人工智能音乐生成器 MusicGen。它可以将文字描述（例如 “一首 80 年代的流行歌曲，背景音效是重鼓声和合成器垫音效”）变成大约 12 秒的音频。该公司没有提供用于训练模型的代码，但它提供了预训练的模型，任何拥有合适硬件的人，如 16GB 的 GPU 都可以运行。

Meta 也发布了一个 “类似人类” 的人工智能图像创作模型 I-JEPA，训练代码和模型快照发布在 GitHub 上。Meta 称，该模型利用相关世界的背景知识来填补图像的缺失部分，而不是像其他生成性人工智能模型那样只看附近的像素。它使用了类似人类的推理，可以避免人工智能生成的图像中常见的错误，如多了手指的手。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[在安装完 Debian 12 “Bookworm”要做的一些事情。


我想你已经安装好了 Debian 12 “Bookworm” 或者 准备升级 了。Debian 12 经过一年多的开发，于 2023 年 6 月 10 日发布。它带来了最新的软件包、升级和替换一些关键模块。请在此查看 Debian 12 的一些新特性 指南。

如果你在笔记本电脑或台式机上使用 Debian，那么在安装或升级到 Debian 12 后，以下是你可能需要完成的一些步骤。

Debian 12 安装后需要做的几件事情

启用 sudo

如果你将 Debian 12 作为新安装的系统，那么你的用户账户可能没有超级用户访问权限。出于安全原因，Debian 在安装期间不允许任何选项给予用户账户 sudo 访问权限。以下是如何将用户添加到超级用户组。

打开终端并使用 root 密码进入 root 账户。

su


然后运行以下命令，将你的用户账户添加到 sudo 组。请将下面的用户名更改为你的账户。

/sbin/addgroup 用户名 sudo


现在，你可以注销并再次登录该账户。

确保 Debian 已更新至最新版本

在开始工作或进行任何配置之前，确保 Debian 12 已更新至最新版本非常重要。从终端中按以下顺序运行以下命令以刷新 Debian 系统。

sudo apt update
sudo apt upgrade


Debian 12 中的非自由软件

Debian 12 中有一个关于管理“非自由”固件包的根本变化。Debian 创建了一个新的软件源，以便轻松访问那些专有包。因此，如果你想添加非自由软件包，需要确保在 APT 软件源文件 /etc/apt/sources.list 中添加以下行：

sudo nano /etc/…]]></summary>

嗅探，嗅探，那是什么？ 🤔

这是我在系统上看到的可疑网络连接吗？ 🚨❌

你可能想知道我如何查看系统上的网络活动。 嗯，当然，一些 系统监控工具 应该有所帮助。但是，如果我想要更多详细信息怎么办？

好吧，我遇到了一个不错的工具 Sniffnet。 它是一个用于实时监控网络活动的简洁的开源应用，也是专有的 GlassWire（如 Portmaster）的一个很好的替代品。

那么，让我们深入挖掘吧！

Sniffnet：概述 ⭐



Sniffnet 是一个基于 Rust 的网络监控工具，可让你跟踪通过系统的所有互联网流量。 它提供了一些非常有用的功能，高级用户肯定会喜欢这些功能**。

当你第一次启动 Sniffnet 时，你会看到一个菜单来选择网络适配器、过滤器和应用协议。

完成选择后，单击“火箭”按钮开始。



这是概览页的样子。它显示了所有当前的网络连接，以及一个方便的流量图，供你分析流量。


📋 你可以选择将数据显示为字节或单个数据包。




要更深入地查看你的网络连接，你可以前往“检查Inspect”选项卡。

在这里，你将看到一个包含所有重要信息的列表，例如 IP 地址、数据包数量、数据量、来源国家等等。

你可以单击各个连接获得更详细的情况。



如果你想为更具体的目的过滤结果怎么办？

好吧，那么你可以使用“检查”选项卡下的过滤器选项根据你的需要过滤结果。

你可以通过以下方式过滤列表： 应用、国家、域名等。

这是它的样子：



Sniffnet 还可以向你显示可以以文本格式导出的连接的详细报告。

只需单击右下角带有页面/向右箭头的徽标即可开始。



可定制性如何？

好吧，Sniffnet 有一组不错的设置供你调整。

第一个是“通知”选项卡，它允许你根据可以设置的各种阈值来设置通知的行为。



然后是可以通过“样式Style”选项卡访问的主题。它提供四种选择，雪人之夜是我的最爱。



最后，“语言Language”选项卡允许你设置你选择的界面语言。



好了，就此结束。

Sniffnet 是一个方便的工具，可以非常详细地了解系统上的网络活动。

你可以使用它来监控你的网络。

此外，与另一个网络监控工具 Nutty 相比，在我看来，Sniffnet 的使用和设置要直观得多。

📥 获取 Sniffnet

Sniffnet 可跨多个平台使用，包括 Linux、Windows 和 macOS。 你可以前往官方网站获取你选择的安装包。


Sniffnet


如果愿意，你还可以在 GitHub 上仔细查看其源代码。

2023年春，《有凤来仪——夏含夷教授七十华诞祝寿论文集》由中西书局正式出版。夏含夷（Edward L. Shaughnessy）是芝加哥大学教授、《剑桥中国上古史》主编。正好夏先生来北京，我专程赴京，4月20日上午、21日晚上分两次对夏先生做了访谈。

《有凤来仪：夏含夷教授七十华诞祝寿论文集》，朱渊清  苏荣誉主编，中西书局2022年12月出版，270.00元

朱渊清：夏先生，这次给您带来了七十岁祝寿的论文集《有凤来仪》，终于出版了。
夏含夷：太好了，非常感谢你。要请你和各位作者给这本书签名。
朱渊清：三十一位中国学者的论文，前些日子已经寄给您电子档，您满意吗？
夏含夷：很满意。我还没有读完。涉及内容实在是太丰富了。
朱渊清：您一辈子从事中国古史研究，取得了巨大的成就，很希望请您谈谈自己的学术经历。
夏含夷：没问题。
朱渊清：您是什么时候如何开始学习中文的，又是如何走上中国古史的研究之路的？
夏含夷：1968年我读高中时正在打越战。1970年我进大学，读的是圣母大学。这是听从了我父亲的建议，不然的话可能就要去当兵。我对思想史有兴趣，大学一年级时遇到两个四年级的朋友，跟着他们听了几门神学课，对中国的道教、禅宗很感兴趣。1972年三年级时，学校终于开了门中文课，老师是香港来的。这是我学中文之始。三年级结束我去参加明德大学暑期班，专门补习中文。明德大学暑期班学习外语特别好，学校周围的风景也很漂亮。
朱渊清：我知道。您的大女儿也在明德大学读过书，学中文。
夏含夷：对。在明德大学暑期班学习外语必须先签一个保证书，保证整个夏天不说英语。老师和学生学习、生活在一起，必须时时讲中文。非常累。
朱渊清：除了中文语言，您对中国文化的兴趣最初是在道教、禅宗。
夏含夷：圣母大学神学系还聘了一个大学者，是芝加哥大学毕业的，我…]]></summary>

《真理与生命》杂志1929年和1930年两期，刊登了李荣芳撰写的两篇《圣地游行记》。《真理与生命》是民国期间极具影响力的基督教刊物，主编为赵紫宸，编辑部成员与“撰述员”基本来自燕京大学宗教学院。这两篇游记，记述了李荣芳于1929年3月到5月在巴勒斯坦地区的两次出游，一次是乘车，“专到紧要的区域”，一次是骑马，“专到闭塞的地方”。
李荣芳（1887-1965）是燕京大学宗教学院教授。相比于吴雷川、赵紫宸这些中国基督教界的名人，他在生前和身后都不是一个响亮的名字。但他有一个独特的背景，是其他民国基督教知识分子所不具备的。李荣芳是在美国受过科班训练的圣经学学者，而不是单纯研究神学的理论家。他于1908年进入汇文大学神科，获得学士和硕士学位。1913年，他进入位于美国新泽西州的德鲁神学院（Drew Theological Seminary，当时译为“芝儒神学院”），大约在1917或1918年获得神学博士。从他的博士导师、博士论文选题、回国后开设的课程、翻译的英文著作以及他自己所撰写的报刊文章，我们可以看到他是一位严谨的圣经学者，而不是泛谈神学义理的神学家。
李荣芳1917年归国，先在自己的母校汇文大学任教。1919年燕京大学成立，汇文大学就是组成燕大的四所教会大学之一，所以李荣芳也就成为燕京大学神学院教授（后改为“宗教学院”）。创校之初，教员中只有两位中国教师，李荣芳便是其中一位，主要教授圣经希伯来文和旧约。根据1931年燕京大学宗教学院的课程大纲，李荣芳开设多门与旧约有关的专业课。在“旧约训诂”的课程类别中，他开设《前代希伯来先知》《后代希伯来先知》《旧约诗文》，在“旧约历史与教义”的课程类别中，开设《以色列民族史》《闪族之宗教》《先知的社会理想》等课。在语言课程中，则教授《希伯来文初阶》《希伯来文训诂》。放眼当时的学术界，能教授古代…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[西数 NAS 硬盘因三年老化警告引发用户恐慌和愤怒

在各个群晖用户论坛里，有用户反馈使用 WDDA 监控和测试子系统的西数硬盘一旦开机时间达到三年，就会在群晖 DSM 上出现 “警告” 标记。WDDA 类似于希捷等硬盘采用的 SMART 技术。WDDA 给出的警告说：“在硬盘的整个寿命中，该硬盘已经积累了大量的开机时间。请考虑尽快更换该硬盘”。但除此之外，硬盘似乎没有明显的问题。群晖称，该警告信息来自于西数而不是群晖。这导致大量用户恐慌，并认为这是“西数试图销售更多硬盘的掠夺性策略”。受 WDDA 影响的一些产品包括 WD Red Pro、WD Red Plus 和 WD Purple。


消息来源：Ars Technica



老王点评：这种强制老化硬盘而不是根据硬盘实际状态给出警告的做法，让用户无法再信任它的产品，只能把用户逼到其它厂商那里。顺便说一句，网上有一个帖子讨论了如何禁止该警告——但可悲是，这个 Reddit 帖子所在子区在抗议活动中暂时不能访问。




英特尔演示新的芯片背面供电技术

英特尔计划在明年推出名为 RibbonFET 的新晶体管技术，以及新的供电方法 PowerVia。PowerVia 是英特尔版本的背面供电技术。今天的芯片是在正面将晶体管与供电和数据传输互连在一起，而背面供电将所有供电互连转移到芯片背面。这会产生两个影响，其一是为正面的数据互连留出了更多空间，其二是供电互连可以更大因此电阻更小。英特尔测试了由当前一代的晶体管和 PowerVia 组合的处理器内核，显示内核频率提升逾 6%，设计更紧凑，功耗降低 30%。过去几代的英特尔芯片在功耗效率上都落后于竞争对手，如 AMD 使用台积电 7 纳米和 5 纳米工艺制造的芯片。


消息来源：Solidot



老王点评：虽然经常说芯片技术要达到极限了，但是我们看到的是总是有各种突破和改进，所以我预期芯片技术还会继续以摩尔定律向前发展。




Edge 会将你在线观看的图片发送到微软

Edge 有一个内置的图像增强工具，可以使用 “超级分辨率来改善网络上图像的清晰度、锐度、照明和对比度”。虽然该功能听起来很令人兴奋，但最近的微软 Edge Canary 更新表明，它会将图像链接发送到微软，而不是在本地设备上执行增强。这个功能虽然可以关闭，但是它是默认启用的。之前，用户还发现 Edge 会将你的浏览器历史记录泄露给 Bing。


消息来源：NeoWin



老王点评：微软的骚操作挺多啊，虽然 Edge 需要更多丰富的功能来胜过 Chrome，但似乎用力过猛了。]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[以下是如何从 Debian 11 升级到 Debian 12 “Bookworm” 的步骤。


Debian 12 Bookworm 已经发布。如果你正在运行 Debian 11 “Bullseye”，你可以计划现在升级你的台式机或服务器。但是，建议你等待 Debian “Bookworm” 的第一个小版本，即 12.1 版本，再进行关键服务器升级。

话虽如此，如果你想了解 Debian 12 的新特性，可以查看 这篇文章。以下是详细的升级步骤：

从 Debian 11 升级到 Debian 12

无论你运行的是 Debian 服务器还是任何桌面版本，请确保备份关键数据。例如，你可能需要为桌面文档进行备份。如果是服务器，请记录正在运行的服务。你可以使用 rsync 或其他实用工具来完成此操作。

Debian 12 引入了一个名为 non-free-firmware 的新仓库，用于专有驱动程序和软件包。如果你使用任何“闭源”的网络、显示、图形或其他驱动程序，你可能需要在升级后进行配置。

对于网络驱动程序，请确保在某个地方安全地记录 /etc/network/interfaces 和 /etc/resolv.conf 文件的内容。如果在升级完成后失去了网络连接，可以 按照这个指南 轻松设置它。

从命令提示符运行以下命令，以确保 Debian 11 更新了安全和其他软件包：

sudo apt update
sudo apt upgrade
sudo apt full-upgrade
sudo apt autoremove


完成上述命令后，重新启动 Debian 11 系统：

sudo systemctl reboot


记下关于 Debian 11 的几个信息。这对于服务器很重要。它们包括内核版本和 Debian 版本。这…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Debian 的下一个重要版本已经发布。




虽然没有固定的时间表，但每隔约两年 Debian 就会推出一个新的稳定版升级。

Debian 11 发布于 2021 年，现在是 2023 年，我们迎来了下一个主要版本 Debian 12。

要注意的是，正如发布说明中所提到的，Debian 12 发布时已知存在约 100 个错误。因此，在升级或安装之前，你可能需要详细阅读此版本的发布说明。


💡 如果你不知道，每个 Debian 的稳定版本都可以得到 至少三年的活动维护和支持，此外，它也提供了 两年的扩展 LTS 支持作为商业服务。直到 2028 年 6 月，Debian 12 都将得到支持。你有一年的时间从 Debian 11 升级。


Debian 12 有哪些新功能？

对于重大版本升级，肯定会更新一些软件包，而过时或老旧的软件会被删除。

与我们在 Debian 12 功能列表 中提到的类似，包括了以下增强功能：


更新的安装程序

Linux 内核 6.1

默认启用 PipeWire 音频系统

全新壁纸


安装程序升级



每个发行版都致力于改进新用户的安装体验，而 Debian 也不例外。

Debian 12 可以更好地处理非自由固件，这是可以提高新用户的入门体验的亮点之一。

此外，还有许多底层改进，包括硬件兼容性升级。

Linux 内核 6.1



Debian 12 带有 LTS 版本的 Linux 内核 6.1。

该内核包含 Rust 的实验性支持、AMD 硬件优化和改进的 ARM 支持。

桌面环境和软件升级

Debian 12 默认预装了 GNOME 43、KDE Plasma 5.27、LXDE 11、LXQt 1.2.0、MATE 1.26 和 XFCE 4.18。新的桌面环境版本应该会提升桌面体验，还有必要的应用程序更新，包括：


GIMP 2.10.34

Perl 5.36

Vim 9.0

OpenJDK 17




不要忘了还有一张新的 壁纸，为所有那些神奇的软件更新增添了装饰。

其他变化



如果你需要了解完整的技术细节和升级信息，可以查看 发行说明 或 官方公告。这里列出了一些重要的更新亮点：


默认启用 PipeWire 音频服务器

基于 Go 的软件包支持限制安全

删除了超过 9,519 个过时/陈旧的软件包

Debian 12 现在可以检测到双引导系统中的 Windows 11。

已经重新引入了 ARM64 上的 Secure Boot 支持。



下载 Debian 12


Debian 12 是一个不错的升级版本，但请注意 某些问题。你已经升级了吗？请让我知道你的想法。

The main goal of zsync is to foster high quality content and discussion. That's it. If it can't accomplish that, then to me it is a failure. I watched Reddit go from having high quality discussion in 2008-9 to devolving into the PC meme dumpster it is today [1]. HN still has the highest discussion quality of any "forum" I know of, but (1) it can sometimes randomly be very hostile/toxic to new tech, the most glaring example being crypto. (2) HN is basically a single subreddit mostly geared towards tech and startups. It'd be nice to have an equivalent of "subreddits"

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Heya HN, I've been working on a reddit-like platform as my primary side project for the last few years. Doing a (very) soft launch today, mainly because I want to use it to encourage discussion of alternatives.
How non.io works:
1. Free to browse, paid to interact.
2. Minimum subscription is $2 (though you can choose more). I take $1 to run the servers, everything left gets split evenly between everything you upvote that month.
It's a simple model, but I hope it's a better one than the freemium model we've been relying on for the last few years. Fundamentally I feel like any ad-supported network doesn't have alignment between the needs of the users and the needs of the platform, which is what drove me to make this.
Because this is a soft launch, if you do subscribe I'd encourage you not to pay for the time being. I'm still testing the distribution algorithm for returning funds - you won't get overcharged or anything, but I just want to guarantee your funds are properly distributed at the end of the month. I've opened up free accounts to post and interact in the meantime. If you want to try a test account, use this login:
login: hackernews pw: helloworld
Edit: Loginless browsing here: https://non.io/#all

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi HN, Cobi here, Co-Founder of DevCycle (https://devcycle.com). DevCycle is a feature flag platform focused on developer experience, speed of delivery and long-term maintainability.
To give the platform a shot, anyone can sign up and use DevCycle for free here: https://devcycle.com
Here’s a general platform demo video if you’re interested: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZD-pyKGwR4
Feature flagging is a technique that lets developers switch features on or off in a software application without redeploying it, enhancing testing and rollback capabilities. At their core, feature flagging platforms solve the problem of separating production code deploys from feature releases to users. While DevCycle solves that same general pain, we also aim to solve core problems in developer experience and …]]></summary>

the strongest claim to the CPU.  There are many factors that complicate
that job, not the least of which is that the "strongest claim" is sometimes
a bit of a fuzzy concept.  Realtime throttling, a mechanism designed to
keep a runaway realtime task from monopolizing the CPU, is one case where
developers have concluded that the task with, ostensibly, the highest
priority should not actually be the one that runs.  But realtime throttling
has rarely pleased anybody; the deadline-server

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[超过 80% 的 Reddit 子区关闭

此前，我们 报道 过，Reddit 为 API 访问设定了远超合理的价格，事实上扼杀了第三方客户端，招致社区的强烈抗议，子区管理员们定于 12 日临时或永久关闭子区以抗议。现在，Reddit 社区开始计划中的大规模抗议。截止发文，Reddit 共有逾 7,266 个子区（版块），目前已有 6,292 个已经关闭了对外访问，从公开变成私有，其中包括订阅数超过四千万的 r/funny，订阅数超三千万的 r/aww、r/gaming、r/Music 等等，订阅人数合计超过 26 亿。Reddit CEO 上周五举办的问答讨论没有解决任何问题，反而更进一步激怒了 Reddit 社区，一些原计划关闭 48 小时的子区也决定无限期关闭。抗议者们还制作了 专门的网站 来统计已经关的子区，非常壮观的列表。


消息来源：Reddark



老王点评：这下好了，都关闭了，Reddit 就省钱了。




Debian 12 “Bookworm” 正式发布

在将近 2 年的开发之后，代号为 “Bookworm” 的 Debian 12 正式发布，它将得到 5 年的支持。Debian 12 使用的桌面环境包括：GNOME 43、KDE Plasma 5.27、LXDE 11 等。该版本的软件包总数达到 64,419，包含 11,089 个新的软件包，移除了 6,296 个过时的软件包，更新了 43,254 个软件包，总占用磁盘空间 365 GB，总代码行数达 13 亿行。


消息来源：Debian



老王点评：无论如何，Debian 仍然是最重要的 Linux 发行版之一，也是诸多发行版的根源。




西方更担心中国获得 AI 主导地位

风险投资家 Marc Andreessen 撰文批评了 “AI 末日论者”，称人工智能 “并不想杀死你，因为它不是活的……人工智能是一台机器 —— 它不会像你的烤面包机那样活过来。”他认为，科技公司之所以倡导建立监管壁垒，形成一个由政府保护的人工智能供应商组成的企业联盟，免受新的创业公司和开源竞争的影响，是这样他们就可以赚更多钱。另外他指出，不以最大力度和速度追求人工智能的实际风险就是中国，中国正在快速发展人工智能。为了阻止中国人工智能影响力的扩散，他认为，“美国和西方国家应该尽可能地靠拢人工智能”。

老王点评：人工智能这个魔盒打开后，基于博弈论的考虑，是无法关上的。]]></summary>

无论是智能手机、桌面电脑还是物联网设备，开源软件在某种形式上无处不在。

虽然安卓是一个开源项目，但你可以在上面找到专有和开源的应用程序。除了你可能已经使用的流行专有安卓应用程序，开源安卓应用程序可以作为更好的替代品，它尊重你的隐私。

在这里，我为你精选了最好的开源安卓应用程序，可以作为日常使用的应用。

希望这个列表对你分享给他人时有所帮助！


📋 列出的开源应用程序可以在谷歌 Play 商店、F-Droid 商店或开发者的官方网站/平台上找到。你应始终使用官方推荐源来下载和安装 APK。


键盘应用



当你发送短信或搜索信息时，键盘应用程序是你最常接触的应用程序。

当然，像 SwiftKey 这样的应用也许在以前还不错，但现在它们已经稍显普通了。此外，选择一个尊重你的隐私、符合预期（没有任何花哨的功能）的开源键盘应用程序才是明智的选择。一些最佳选项包括：

1、Simple Keyboard

如其名称所示，Simple Keyboard 是一个 极简的选项，适合想要没有花哨功能的简单键盘应用程序的用户。它是谷歌默认键盘应用程序 Gboard 的出色替代品。

但如果你想要主题自定义和一些额外的控件，它可能会让你失望。


📥 GitHub



📥 F-Droid



📥 Play 商店


2、AnySoftKeyboard

AnySoftKeyboard 是我的最爱，它拥有我需要的所有基本功能，包括 主题自定义、快速文本和手势支持。

如果你想要一个简单的键盘体验，它可以很简单；如果你要求更多的功能，它也可以是一个合适工具。

詹姆斯·鲍斯威尔（James Boswell）1740年生于苏格兰的爱丁堡，其父是贵族兼大法官，原本希望子承父业，但鲍斯威尔醉心于伦敦的游乐，尤好结交名士。1763年他和约翰生在伦敦初次相见，两人逐渐克服了年龄、家庭背景、性格爱好等方面的差异，成为忘年至交。他的《约翰生传》常常被誉为“现代欧洲传记的鼻祖”。
这本传记涵盖了约翰生的一生，包含大量的轶事和人物对话。鲍斯威尔自豪地说，“在这部作品中，约翰生的形象将比其他任何留在人们记忆中的，都更完整、更清晰”。传统传记刻意追求伦理意义，如中世纪的圣徒传记，往往将传主理想化、圣洁化。而鲍斯威尔开创的现代传记，其特点就是真实地再现传主的人生及其所处的时代。约翰生曾教导鲍斯威尔，传记作家的责任就是“展示日常生活中的微小细节”，不要回避传主的缺点。这本传记记录了约翰生的许多怪癖，但更突显了约翰生狂放孤傲的秉性、独立的人格以及率真的性情。二十多年来，鲍斯威尔孜孜不倦地记下有关约翰生的言谈，这本传记并非仅仅“记事”，更是大量地“记言”。《约翰生传》不乏戏剧性，转述大段的对话时，灵活自如地照顾到各位发言者的独特性格和语气，读者屡屡有亲临历史现场之感。 
值得一提的是，《约翰生传》提供了大量的历史材料，将十八世纪中后期的英国社会浓缩在其中，如果我们对当时的社会、文化背景不甚了了，恐怕很难体会鲍斯威尔的匠心。中国读者得感谢《约翰生传》的译者蒲隆先生。这个中文全译本的准确、流畅且不说，大量的注释，尤其是人物“小传”，更是读者必不可少的“辅助材料”。蒲先生翻译《约翰生传》，主要依据“人人文库”和企鹅出版社的版本（详情可以参见2023年3月24日的《上海书评》）。企鹅经典版由大卫·沃默斯利（David Womersley）编辑，拉丁语、希腊…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[不太会讲笑话的 ChatGPT

研究人员发现 ChatGPT 对笑话的了解是相当有限的：在一次测试中，输出的 1008 个笑话中有 90% 是相同的 25 个笑话。其中说了 140 次的笑话是：“为什么稻草人会获奖？因为他在自己的领域里表现突出。（双关语：站在田地里）”当被要求解释 25 个最常见的笑话中的每一个时，ChatGPT 大多提供了有效的解释，表明它 “理解” 文字游戏和双关语等风格。有趣的是，ChatGPT 喜欢拿番茄开玩笑。


消息来源：Ars Technica



老王点评：看来人工智能在这么高级的理解上还有所欠缺。不过，即便真的人工智能懂得讲各种笑话之后，距离它“拥有”情感，估计也有很漫长的距离。




英特尔开源 One Mono 编程字体

英特尔公布了 One Mono 字体，这是一种迎合 “开发者需求” 的新字体，采用 “富有表现力” 的等宽字体，以提高清晰度和可读性。它更容易阅读，而且可以免费使用，采用了开源的字体许可证。它不仅可以免费下载和使用，还可以免费编辑，并免费重新发布。


消息来源：GitHub



老王点评：嗯，又一个开源的编程字体，虽然有一些好评，但是似乎这些编程字体都差不多，那为什么大家要不断发布自己的开源字体呢？




自动驾驶的 Waymo 汽车在路上撞死了狗

报告称 Waymo 的一辆汽车在旧金山碾压了一只狗。这起事件是 Waymo 首次报告的死亡事件。从街景链接来看，这条路看起来像一个繁忙的工业区，有许多仓库、卡车送货区和铁丝网围栏。一只小狗跑到 Waymo 自动汽车前面的街道上。Waymo 自动汽车随后与该狗发生了接触，该狗没有生还。撞击发生时，Waymo 自动汽车的 4 级自动驾驶系统处于自主模式，并且有一名测试司机在场（在司机座位上）。Waymo 发表声明称，“系统正确识别了从停放的车辆后面跑出来的狗，但未能避免接触。”


消息来源：Ars Technica



老王点评：虽然这看起来是不可避免的，但是我一直觉得法律责任和保险责任是自动驾驶真正成熟的前提，甚至不是技术。]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[如果你和我一样，在 20 世纪七八十年代使用计算机长大，你可能学过一种常见的个人计算机编程语言，名为 BASIC（全称是 “初学者的通用符号指令代码Beginner's All-purpose Symbolic Instruction Code”）。那个时期，包括 TRS-80、Apple II 和 IBM PC 在内的每台个人计算机都可以找到 BASIC 实现。当时，我是一个自学的 BASIC 程序员，在尝试了 Apple II 上的 AppleSoft BASIC 后，转向 IBM PC 上的 GW-BASIC，后来在 DOS 上学习了 QuickBASIC。


我通过编写一个示例程序来探索 BASIC 和 FORTRAN 77 中的 FOR 循环，以将数字列表从 1 加到 10。


但是曾经，一种在科学编程领域受欢迎的语言是 FORTRAN（即 “公式翻译FORmula TRANslation”）。尽管在 1990 年对该语言进行的规范以后，该名称更常见的风格是 “Fortran”。

当我在 1990 年代初作为大学本科物理学生学习物理学时，我利用自己在 BASIC 上的经验学习了 FORTRAN 77。那时我意识到 BASIC 许多概念都来源于 FORTRAN。当然，FORTRAN 和 BASIC 在很多其他方面也存在差异，但我发现了解一点 BASIC 可以帮助我快速学习 FORTRAN 编程。

我想通过使用两种语言编写相同的程序，展示它们之间的一些相似之处。通过编写一个示例程序来探索 BASIC 和 FORTRAN 77 中的 FOR 循环，这个程序将把 1 到 10 之间的数字相加。

BASIC 存在许多种不同的版本，这取决于你的计算机，但该语言总体保持不变。我喜欢的一种 BASIC 版本是 Bywater…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[在 上一篇文章 中，你学习了函数。在这篇文章中，我们将学习使用条件语句来管理 Rust 程序的控制流。

什么是条件语句？

在编写代码的时候，最常见的任务之一就是检查某些条件是否为 true 或 false。“如果温度高于 35°C，打开空调。”

通过使用 if 和 else 这样的关键字（有时候结合使用），程序员可以根据条件（例如提供的参数数量、从命令行传递的选项、文件名、错误发生等）改变程序的行为。

所以，对一个程序员来说，了解任何语言的控制流都是至关重要的，更不用说 Rust 了。

条件运算符

下表列出了所有常用的单个条件运算符：




运算符
示例
解释




>
a > b
a 大于 b


<
a < b
a 小于 b


==
a == b
a 等于 b


!=
a != b
a 不等于 b


>=
a >= b
a 大于 或 等于 b


<=
a <= b

运算符
示例
解释




|| （逻辑或）
条件1 || 条件2
条件1 或 条件2 中至少有一个为 true


&& （逻辑与）
条件1 && 条件2
所有 条件都为 true


! （逻辑非）
!条件

📋 与数学相似，你可以使用圆括号来指定操作的优先级。


使用 if else

要控制 Rust 代码的基本流程，使用两个关键字：if 和 else。这可以根据提供的条件的状态创建两个“执行路径”。

一个简单的带有替代执行路径的 if 块的语法如下：

if 条件 {

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[杰伊·温特、徐国琦（章静 绘）

耶鲁大学历史系教授杰伊·温特（Jay Winter）是第一次世界大战史研究的领军人物。他召集七十多名历史学家组成的国际团队共同编写《剑桥第一次世界大战史》，以跨国史视角和研究方法来叙述这场现代社会的浩劫，呈现了大量一手资料和最新研究成果。杰伊·温特的个人著作主要有《记忆之地，哀悼之所：欧洲文化史中的第一次世界大战》（Sites of Memory, Sites of Mourning: The Great War in European Cultural History, 1995）、《勿忘战争》（Remembering War, 2006）和《和平与自由的梦想》（Dreams of Peace and Freedom, 2006）等。以《中国与大战》《一战中的华工》等研究享誉国际的香港大学历史系教授徐国琦是《剑桥第一次世界大战史》编写团队中唯一的中国学者。他近年来提倡并身体力行“共有的历史”研究方法，跳出民族国家视野的学术范畴，着眼于跨国史及不同文明之间的交流，著有《中国人与美国人：一部共有的历史》《亚洲与一战：一部共有的历史》《奥林匹克之梦：中国与体育，1895-2008》等。
在《剑桥第一次世界大战史》中文版出版之际，《上海书评》邀请徐国琦教授与杰伊·温特教授进行了一次线上对谈，他们就历史写作中的跨国史视野，以及一战史研究近十年的新议题与新动向交换了想法。

《剑桥第一次世界大战史》（三卷），【美】杰伊·温特主编，姚百慧等译，浙江大学出版社2023年3月出版，238.00元

徐国琦：首先祝贺您主编的《剑桥第一次世界大战史》中文版面世。如果我没记错的话，法文版是十年前的2013年出版的，所以这是十周年纪念了。
杰伊·温特：这的确是第一次世界大战史研究中的特殊时刻。如你所知，这部书是一项集体成就，我们也都知道这并不太常见。在我们的职业领…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In the flatpak vs snap discussions, one thing that is rarely brought up is the actual strength of the sandboxes they use. Snap uses AppArmor for confinement (meaning that non-AppArmor distros, like Fedora, have weak confinement). Meanwhile, flatpak uses bubblewrap.
 And assume best possible conditions. Snap is running on Ubuntu where confinement is strongest, apps do not have access to X11, and does not have access to home folder.
 I haven't been able to find any serious in-depth testing on this topic comparing the two directly.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[谷歌 Bard 现在可以自己编写代码来回答问题

谷歌表示 Bard 在逻辑和推理方面越来越好。谷歌说，现在当你问 Bard 一个计算任务，如数学或字符串操作，Bard 不像其它大语言模型一样显示语言模型的输出，而是会写一个程序，并执行该程序，然后向用户显示该程序的输出作为答案。谷歌举例说，对于“请为我逆转 Lollipop 这个单词”的问题，ChatGPT 会通过语言模型给出答案 “pillopoL”，这个答案是错误的。而 Bard 会显示正确的结果，并给出计算的 Python 代码。当然，谷歌警告说，Bard 可能会对你的问题解释错误从而犯错；也有可能编写了错误的程序，就像人类编写程序一样，往往第一遍是带有错误的。


消息来源：谷歌



老王点评：这就太像人类了，居然会自己编程、自己运行。




GitHub Copilot 是一种“巧妙的软件盗版方法”

GitHub Copilot 是根据 OpenAI 的 Codex 模型建立的代码建议工具，由微软的 GitHub 进行商业化。Copilot 因其无视版权和许可证直接输出开发者公开发布的开源代码而被起诉。微软、GitHub 和 OpenAI 试图驳回此案，但只设法甩掉了一些索赔，法官保留了主要的版权和许可问题待审。2022 年 7 月，为了回应公众对 Copilot 的批评，GitHub 推出了一个用户可调整的 Copilot 过滤器，以将代码建议及其周围约 150 个字符的代码与 GitHub 上的公共代码进行检查。如果有匹配或接近匹配，该代码建议将不会显示给你。但 Copilot 优化了 AI 输出的温度设置，以尽可能多地产生许可内容的小变化，使其看起来不是完全复制的，来逃避版权和许可的侵犯。投诉称，“Copilot 是一种巧妙的软件盗版方法”。


消息来源：The Register



老王点评：到底改变多少才不算抄袭呢？或许，我觉得更公平的做法是，在输出代码时提示该代码衍生自哪种许可证的代码，因此受哪种许可证影响，如何使用取决于用户自己。但似乎这样做存在一些技术困难，因为 AI 到底是如何糅合出新的代码，对人类来说还是一个黑盒。




Reddit 封杀第三方客户端之后的社区反应

之前，我们 报道 过， Reddit 大幅调整了其 API 价格，事实上扼杀了第三方客户端。出于对此政策的极度不满，Reddit 社区将于 6 月 12 日举行大规模抗议活动，参与抗议的大部分子区将关闭 48 小时，但还有部分将无限期关闭。ArchiveTeam 团队希望赶在 12 日之前 存档 内容，他们目前已存档了 108 亿个帖子（包括帖子内容、评论和图像），还有 1.5 亿个帖子等待完成，团队表示时间来不及了，希望更多人参与帮助。此外，著名的 Reddit 第三方 iOS 客户端 Apollo 宣布将于 6 月 30 日 关闭 该客户端，并 公开 了其后端源代码以示它是合法使用 API，并遵守了 API 的速率限制。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[在失去亲人后为开源项目做贡献可能会让人感到畏惧。下面是我对如何重新加入社区的建议。


开源社区是一个奇妙的地方，在这里人们聚集在一起合作，分享知识，并建立令人惊奇的东西。我还记得 12 年前 我在 Fedora 的第一次贡献，从那时起，这就是一个奇妙的旅程。然而，生活有时会妨碍我们，导致我们从参与中抽身。COVID-19 大流行病以不同的方式影响了我们所有人，对一些人来说，这是一个巨大的损失和悲痛的时期。我在大流行期间失去了我的爱人，这是最难处理的生活事件。这也让我从 Fedora 社区休息了一段时间。对于那些因为失去亲人而不得不休息的开源社区成员来说，重新回到编码和为项目做贡献可能会让人感到畏惧。然而，通过一些思考和计划，有可能卷土重来，再次成为社区的积极成员。

首先，最重要的是照顾好自己，让自己有时间和空间去悲伤。悲伤是一种个人和独特的经历。没有正确或错误的方式去经历它。重要的是要善待自己。在你准备好之前，不要急于做事情。

当你准备好重新开始贡献，你可以做几件事来使你的复出尽可能顺利。

与其他贡献者联系

这是一个艰难的事实：没有什么东西会因为你而停止，技术正在以指数形式增长。当我最近重新加入 Fedora 的时候，我觉得世界在我身边变化得太快了。从 IRC 到 Telegram 再到 Signal 和 Matrix，从 IRC 会议 到谷歌会议，从 Pagure 到 GitLab，从邮件列表到讨论区，这个名单还在继续。如果你有一段时间没有在你的社区里活动，联系你在社区里的朋友，让他们知道你回来了，并准备再次做出贡献，这可能会有帮助。这可以帮助你与人们重新建立联系，并重新进入事情的轨道。他们可能有一些建议或机会让你参与其中。我很感谢我的 Fedora 朋友 Justin W. Flory，他无私地帮助我，确保我找到了回到社区的方法。

从小事做起

过去，我曾担任 Fedora 多样性、公平和包容（D.E.I.）顾问，这是 Fedora 理事会 成员职位之一。这是一个很大的工作。我认识到这一点，而且我知道如果我在休息后立即考虑做同样的工作，那么这将是一个负担，有可能导致 早期倦怠。放轻松是非常重要的。从小事做起。

如果你对重新投入一个大项目的想法感到不知所措，那就从小事做起。有大量的小任务和错误需要修复，解决其中的一个问题可以帮助你轻松地回到社区。

找一个导师

如果你对如何开始或将你的努力集中在哪里感到不确定，可以考虑找一个 导师。导师（就我而言，是 Justin W. Flory）可以在你复出时提供指导、建议和支持。

展示感激

开源社区是建立在许多人的贡献之上的。一个健康的社区会对你的贡献表示感谢。表达感激之情是使社区健康发展的一部分。对那些帮助你、指导你、给你反馈的人表示感谢。

封锁你的日历

最初，可能需要一些时间来恢复贡献的节奏。在你的日历中安排一些时间用于开源工作是有帮助的。它可以是每周/每两周一次，取决于你的可用性。记住，每一个贡献都很重要，这就是开源世界的魅力所在。这个技巧将帮助你养成规律的作息习惯。

向前两步，向后一步

最后，重要的是要记住，如果你需要，退一步也没关系。悲伤不是一个线性过程。你可能会发现，你在未来需要再次休息一下。重要的是，要对自己和他人诚实，了解自己的需求。利用你需要的时间来照顾自己。

按照你自己的条件返回

在经历了一段时间的悲痛之后，回到开源社区可能是一种挑战。这也是一个与你所热衷的事物重新联系的机会，并对世界产生积极影响。随着时间的推移，你会发现你能够从你离开的地方拾起，并再次重新参与到社区中。

我把我的第一篇 Opensource.com 文章献给我已故的弟弟 Nalin Sharma 先生，他在 2021 年因 COVID-19 而离开我们，年仅 32 岁。他是一个充满激情的工程师，充满了生命力。我希望他现在在一个更好的地方，我相信他将永远活在我的记忆中。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[又一次，Linus Torvalds 立场坚定地、咆哮地小小回复了某人。




Linus Torvalds 又发表了一篇热点看法（或争议？）🐧

一切都始于 Linus Torvalds 对《纽约时报》网页体验的看法。

在 social.kernel.org 上发布的一篇公开帖子中，Linus 抱怨了纽约时报网站上的广告和糟糕的用户体验。此外，他还感到烦恼的是，人们必须致电该网站团队才能取消订阅纽约时报。

下面是他的发帖：



但是，这与我们新闻标题毫不相关，是吗？😕

是有点无关，但这件事还有更多的内容。

实际上，Linus 在 他的帖子 中继续向他的一些粉丝解释，他并不介意订阅纽约时报，但是由于令人讨厌的体验，这变成了一项不可接受的条件。

在他的帖子的一条评论中，一位用户还提到纽约时报不值得关注，并将其称为“清醒的共产主义宣传”。

以下是该用户的原文：



虽然这与最初讨论的上下文无关，但 Linus Torvalds 坚定的表明了他对这种观点的信仰。



他的回复如下：


我觉得你可能不应该关注我，因为你那个“清醒的共产主义宣传”的评论让我觉得你是一个一流的白痴。我强烈怀疑我就是你担心的那些“清醒的共产主义者”之一。但你可能无法解释这两个词的任何一个真正意思，对吧？


此外，他还分享了下面这段话：


我是一名持证的无神论者，我认为妇女的选择权非常重要，我认为“有组织的民兵”意味着应该仔细发放枪支许可证，而不是随便给予任何有脉搏的白痴，我一点也不在意你决定穿“错误”的衣服或者决定不为你出生时的性别所束缚。该死的，如果这些让我成为“清醒”的人，那么我认为使用这个词作为贬义词的任何人都是人类的耻辱。所以请立刻取消关注我吧。


虽然这只是社交媒体上的一次言论碰撞，但他的回复被一些人视为有争议，有些人将他标签为“左派”（不管这是什么意思）。

当然，还有其他人认为 Linus Torvalds 正确地表达了他想要说的话，这没有什么不对的。如果你了解 Linus Torvalds，你会知道他通常直言不讳地表达自己的观点。

就像他最近对 Linux 6.3 的 一个糟糕的提交请求 感到愤怒一样。

在这里，我们不讨论具体问题。当然，我们关注的是 Linux 和开源软件……还有 Linus Torvalds 😉

但是，从回复中可以看出，Linus Torvalds 似乎不喜欢用“清醒”一词来贬低某些事物。他明显尊重其他人的选择，并且“一点也不在意”。

💬你认为 Linus Torvalds 对“清醒的共产主义”意识形态的看法怎么样？请在下方评论区分享你的想法。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[两位意义不同的“杨老师”
杨志洵，字（或号）景苏，亦作劲苏、劲素，江苏金匮（今无锡市）人，卒于1939年，生年不详。他不算是一个名人，却被文史爱好者不时提到。人们对他的兴趣和了解主要来自两组关系，以下略为分解。
其一，杨志洵在胡适的早年进学之路上发挥过关键作用，是后者终生铭感的恩师。1910年，沉沦上海的胡适受许怡荪、程乐亭等友人劝告资助，进京应考庚款留美。在北京，二哥胡觉（字绍之）的好友杨志洵“厚待”之，介绍他“住在新在建筑中的女子师范学校（后来的女师大）校舍里”；考取后南下上海，旅费也是杨志洵借他的，后由胡觉代为归还（1911年1月10日胡觉致胡适信，《胡适遗稿及秘藏书信》，黄山书社1994年版）。
这场耽搁不过月馀，胡适就录取赴美了，留下的印象却非常美好，至以“怜我无家能慰我，佳儿娇女倍情亲”的诗句来形容。两年后的圣诞节，胡适在美国受到白特生（Patterson）夫妇“有如家人骨肉”般的招待，感激之馀，想到的是：“前在都门，杨景苏夫妇亦复如是。”（1912年12月25日日记，《胡适日记全集》，联经出版公司2004年版）
除了生活上的照顾，杨氏还辅导胡适功课，给予他学术上的关键点拨：
杨先生指点我读旧书，要我从《十三经注疏》用功起。我读汉儒的经学，是从这个时候起的。（《四十自述》，亚东图书馆1939年版）

胡适《四十自述》手稿中的杨志洵

这里说得较为简略，更详细的指导过程，可从胡适当时写给许怡荪的信里窥见端倪：
昨向友人处借得《十三经注疏》读之，始知讲经非从古注入手不可。古注虽亦有大谬之处，然参考众说，可得其真意；再以朱子集注参观之，以新文法旁证之，说经之奥，尽于此矣。甚望足下先从经入手，以史辅之，一二年后根柢定矣，然后从事文艺，乃为有根据之学问。（1910年7月18日函，《胡适许怡荪通信集》，上海人民出版社2017年版）
这里的“友人”，当然就是杨志洵。现在看来，…]]></summary>

其一，杨志洵在胡适的早年进学之路上发挥过关键作用，是后者终生铭感的恩师。1910年，沉沦上海的胡适受许怡荪、程乐亭等友人劝告资助，进京应考庚款留美。在北京，二哥胡觉（字绍之）的好友杨志洵“厚待”之，介绍他“住在新在建筑中的女子师范学校（后来的女师大）校舍里”；考取后南下上海，旅费也是杨志洵借他的，后由胡觉代为归还（1911年1月10日胡觉致胡适信，《胡适遗稿及秘藏书信》，黄山书社1994年版）。
这场耽搁不过月馀，胡适就录取赴美了，留下的印象却非常美好，至以“怜我无家能慰我，佳儿娇女倍情亲”的诗句来形容。两年后的圣诞节，胡适在美国受到白特生（Patterson）夫妇“有如家人骨肉”般的招待，感激之馀，想到的是：“前在都门，杨景苏夫妇亦复如是。”（1912年12月25日日记，《胡适日记全集》，联经出版公司2004年版）
除了生活上的照顾，杨氏还辅导胡适功课，给予他学术上的关键点拨：
杨先生指点我读旧书，要我从《十三经注疏》用功起。我读汉儒的经学，是从这个时候起的。（《四十自述》，亚东图书馆1939年版）

胡适《四十自述》手稿中的杨志洵

这里说得较为简略，更详细的指导过程，可从胡适当时写给许怡荪的信里窥见端倪：
昨向友人处借得《十三经注疏》读之，始知讲经非从古注入手不可。古注虽亦有大谬之处，然参考众说，可得其真意；再以朱子集注参观之，以新文法旁证之，说经之奥，尽于此矣。甚望足下先从经入手，以史辅之，一二年后根柢定矣，然后从事文艺，乃为有根据之学问。（1910年7月18日函，《胡适许怡荪通信集》，上海人民出版社2017年版）
这里的“友人”，当然就是杨志洵。现在看来，…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The current events of Reddit and Stack Exchange amplifying a thought that communities and users' contributions should be decentralized. The current structure of online communication poses a major risk.
1. There has to be a movement at both protocol and community-level to bring a Usenet like forum for general consumption. Different decetralized subgroups hosting and replicating the communities for others.
2. The model needs to be rethought to ensure that the thoughts and knowledge of communities and users belong to them.
3. These forums should encourage less anonymity and more persistent communication.
4. Trustworthy individuals should run these forums, chosen by the community. Individual groups, academia, organizations running the communities but easily redistributed across to people who want it. This was usenet.
Failure to address these issues allows mega companies to exploit data and control access against users' wishes.
Taking action is crucial to prevent unfavorable outcomes and hold ourselves accountable.

subject of a session led by VFS co-maintainer Christian Brauner at the
2023 Linux Storage, Filesystem,
Memory-Management and BPF Summit.  As might be guessed, it was a
filesystem-track session; Brauner had three separate items he planned on
bringing up, but the discussion on the first two consumed the whole
half-hour—and then some.  A mechanism to avoid media-change races when
mounting loop (or loopback) and other devices was disposed of fairly
quickly, but the 
discussion around the mount-beneath feature went on at length.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Priority inversion comes about when a low-priority task holds a resource
that is needed by a higher-priority task, with the result that the wrong
task is the only one that can run.  This problem is arguably most acute in
realtime settings, but it can happen in just about any system that has
multiple tasks running.  The variety of
scheduling classes provided by the Linux kernel make handling priority
inversion a difficult problem; the latest version of the proxy
execution patch series points toward a possible solution.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Vivaldi 将伪装成 Edge 以让用户使用必应聊天

很多网站和服务会根据用户代理（UA）字符串来限制浏览器访问，比如谷歌的一些服务。Vivaldi 在 2019 年修改了 UA 冒充 Chrome 以实现更好的谷歌服务兼容性。而最近，微软的基于 GPT-4 的必应聊天也限制只能在 Edge 浏览器中使用，因此，最新版本的 Vivaldi 将能冒充 Edge 浏览器以帮助用户绕过使用限制。


消息来源：Vivaldi



老王点评：虽然说是让用户方便了，但是总感觉这种做法不够大气，像这样的功能，就不应该是浏览器官方提供的功能，而应该是第三方插件的功能。




邮件网关厂商让用户更换有漏洞的设备而不是打补丁升级

Barracuda 公司的电子邮件安全网关（ESG）负责扫描所有传入和传出的电子邮件以查找恶意软件。在收到关于来自其 ESG 设备的异常流量的报告后，该公司发现恶意流量是利用了其 ESG 设备中一个以前未知的漏洞，于是向所有受影响的设备推送了一个漏洞补丁。到这里都还是正常的剧本。令人震惊的是，该公司突然开始敦促其 ESG 客户批量废弃并更换受影响的设备，而不是打补丁。并且，该公司还说 ESG 客户还应该轮换与设备相连的任何凭证。


消息来源：Krebs on Security



老王点评：这操作委实厉害，连软件更新都无法挽救了。




iOS 17 会自动删除链接的跟踪参数

在链接中添加跟踪参数是广告商和分析公司试图跟踪用户在网站上的活动的一种方式。与其存储第三方 Cookie，不如简单地将跟踪标识符添加到页面 URL 的末端，这将规避 Safari 的标准智能跟踪预防功能。iOS 17 和 macOS Sonoma 将新增链接跟踪保护功能，在邮件、信息和 Safari 浏览器的私人浏览模式下自动激活。它可以检测到链接 URL 中可识别的用户跟踪参数，并自动将其删除。


消息来源：9to5mac



老王点评：这是完全不给广告商留路的做法啊，这里的跟踪参数估计不少是谷歌的吧。]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[采用基于开源原则的组织治理可以引导你的组织降低成本，降低技术债务，增加团队协作，促进创新，最重要的是，推动你的组织共同前进。


在我的职业生涯中，我很幸运地与许多不同规模的组织在各种项目上合作。所有这些项目的核心都是开源软件，而且大多数人都对开源社区做出了力所能及的回报。我最近在一个大型组织内从事一个使用开源软件的绿地项目。在项目的 MVP 阶段结束后，该组织的领导层很想知道是什么导致了项目的成功，以及他们如何将其应用到整个组织的其他团队中。经过思考，我发现我们团队的工作方式与开源社区和开发之间有相似之处。以下是对开源原则如何帮助组织节省资金、减少技术债务 和打破内部孤岛的一些见解。

1、更好地使用预算

我最近在佛罗里达 Drupal 营地发表了关于 无头全渠道网络平台 的演讲。演讲中强调的主要好处之一是如何通过实施这种网络平台来节省资金。这个想法来自于开源软件的开发。一个组织内的不同小组可以利用他们的预算来为一个核心软件或平台贡献特性或功能。他们还可以与其他小组合作，集中资金开发更复杂的功能。当功能开发完成后，它将被添加到核心软件或平台中，供所有人使用。使用这种开源原则可以为组织内的团体提供互利。允许共享特性和功能，并集体从彼此的支出中获益，可以改善软件或平台。

这种方法的另一个方面是可以节省开支，并允许持续改进，即对一个功能进行一次测试和开发，并重复使用它。在创建一个使用基于组件的设计系统作为起点的网络平台时，我们经常看到这种情况。该平台的用户可以重复使用其他用户开发的组件或功能。通常，这些都已经经过了无数次的测试，比如用户体验、可及性，甚至是安全测试。

这个简单的想法在许多组织中面临反对，因为个别团体觊觎和保护预算。团体不愿意放弃他们的预算来支持核心软件或平台。某些情况下，优先级和意见上的差异加剧了许多机构的孤岛化。

2、减少技术债务

许多机构努力减少技术债务。实施一个全面的核心软件或平台并使用开源原则，可以帮助减少技术债务。这可以通过允许开发团队充分考虑一个功能不仅对建立它的小组，而且对更广泛的组织有什么影响。这一点，加上与组织内其他小组的合作，可以帮助减少未来重建或增加功能的需要。

有时，由于内部竞争，组织在这种合作和思考方面会有困难。一些公司培养了一种文化，即第一个建立一个功能或提出一个想法会得到奖励。这可能会导致各小组不一起工作或分享想法，在组织内形成孤岛，大大阻碍了创新。

3、更快进入市场

我经常听到的一句话是“更快进入市场”。每个人都想更快、更容易地把他们的东西推出去。这通常是一个核心软件或平台的好处，因为内部团体可以重用现有的、经过测试和验证的特性和功能，而不是从头开始建立自己的功能。如果你的团队正在启动一个项目，而它可以从 80% 的完成度而不是 0% 的完成度开始，你会这样做吗？我想是的。现在再加上为其他用户增加所需功能的超级英雄感觉。这是一个双赢的结果！

4、发布兴奋点

另一个可以帮助你的组织的伟大的开源原则是建立兴奋的发布时间表。当你的组织实施一个核心软件或平台时，用户会对更新的时间进行投资。一个发布时间表和路线图可以向他们传达这一点。这两个工具可以帮助用户对新功能感到兴奋，并相应地规划他们自己的路线图。这也有助于建立对其他团队的欣赏，以及对建立新功能的团队的自豪感。这可以统一一个组织，让组织有团队合作和成就感，同时提供结构和未来的计划。

5、一个核心团队和管理

我发现你需要两个关键项目来克服上述障碍，并在你的组织内成功应用开源原则。这就是： 一个核心团队和坚实的组织管理。一个核心团队将允许一个小组来维护和管理你的组织的核心软件或平台。它将支持该解决方案，并确保明智地增加新的特性和功能。这个团队可以帮助减少内部团队的成本，并告知各组路线图的功能。核心团队需要得到强大的组织治理的支持。这种治理将为组织内的小组提供一个共同的方向和组织支持，以取得成功。这种组织治理可以在几个方面模仿开源的治理和原则。最基本和最高级别的原则是社区和为共同目标而工作的理念。

开放式领导

采用基于 开源原则 的组织治理可以引导你的组织降低成本，降低技术债务，增加团队协作，促进创新，最重要的是，推动你的组织共同前进。

我们生活在一个激动人心的时代。不久之前，我们都被束缚在“升级跑步机”上，被迫每隔几年购买昂贵的新电脑。

今天，借助开源软件的好处，你可以打破这种循环。其中一种方法是 翻新旧电脑，让它们继续发挥作用。本文告诉你如何实现。

1、找一台旧电脑

也许你的地下室或仓库里有一台闲置的旧电脑，为什么不利用一下呢？

或者你可以从朋友、家人或二手广告中得到一台旧机器。许多电子回收中心会让你四处翻找并带走一台你看上的被抛弃的机器。如果可以的话，务必多带回来几台，因为你可能需要从几台被弃置的电脑中获取零件来组装成一台好的电脑。

看看机器前面的贴纸，确保选择的是好的可供翻新的机器。带有 Windows 7 和 8 标志的电脑非常适合运行 Linux。对于 8.1，其扩展支持已于今年 1 月份结束，所以我看到很多这样的电脑被丢弃。

很多这些 Windows 电脑提供了完全良好的硬件。它们只是因为计划性过时而被丢弃了，因为它们不能运行 Windows 11。但是它们可以很好地运行开源软件。

2、确认并清洁所有零件

在打开你的“新”机器之前，确保通过触摸金属物品消除静电。有可能一点点的静电都会破坏精细的电路。

你需要马上查看是否缺失了零件。许多人在丢弃电脑之前会取出它们的硬盘或内存条。你要么需要获取多台机器来解决这一点，要么就需要购买一两个零件来使它完整。

在进一步操作之前，给机器做彻底的清洁非常重要。特别注意 CPU 的复杂结构、风扇和所有表面。请记住，你不能用抹布来清洁电子设备，否则会有损坏的风险，因此使用压缩空气来清洁。

3、确保所有硬件均正常工作

在安装任何软件之前，你需要验证所有硬件是否正常工作。不要省略测试！如果你在进行下一步操作之前只是短暂运行了内存测试，并在以后发现你的计算机…]]></summary>

成濑在中国拥有广大的影迷，但是他们中的多数人并不清楚这位电影大师来过中国。李香兰的回忆为成濑的上海之行添了细节，而在凯瑟琳·罗素那本近六百页的成濑专著里，它只是干巴巴的一句：“成濑来到上海拍摄了这部《上海之月》，但正如彼得·海伊指出的，他自己远离电影所暗示的帝国主义狂热。”（《成濑巳喜男的电影》，复旦大学出版社，2014年10月版，180页）
关于成濑去上海拍摄电影，彼得·海伊（Peter B. High）在《帝国的银幕》中这样写道：“成濑巳喜男的情况与沟口健二、小津安二郎相似。尽管明显受到了一些压力，他同样力图避免公开的军事宣传……《上海之月》这部聚焦中国的政治宣传电台的谍战剧情片，代表了他在国策电影这个领域最具雄心的一次努力。”作者随后摘引了成濑1941年接受日本电影杂志采访时讲的一段话：“我在上海的时候尽可能多看美国电影……如果其他电影人也有类似的机会去感受美国所取得的精彩进展，日本电影也会突飞猛进的。”（The Imperial Screen，University of Wisconsin Press，2003年版，187页）

 As you may or may not know, there's an app called Shortcat for Mac, which is amazingly cool: it allows you to navigate the "whole" UI using the keyboard (something like Vimium in the browser, but for all the "normal" windows)
 I has quite a bunch of extra features (finding emojis etc.), and it even works in Electron apps (I think they tend to be different than "normal" windows in all OSes)
 I was wondering if there's a similar app for Linux that I'm not aware.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi All, I have a fun linux admin challenge that has me sweating a bit. I have a fleet of AWS Lightsail VPS servers running basic wordpress / mysql. They're managed by the Plesk dashboard but generally Ubuntu servers. I stood them up five years ago on Ubuntu 16.04, then upgraded remotely over SSH to Ubuntu 18.04. 
 Now it's two years later and I just upgrade to 20.04. Things generally fine but I realize it has a very old network config, and some ipv6 scraps I want to fix. That means a fully remote, non-console, no boot from USB, SSH network package re-configuration. Any disconnect means a reboot or bricked box. I found the below online and thinking to script it but if it crashes then I'm restoring from a backup. 
 Any super skills or ideas for how to handle this? Alternate SSH windows won't help if I'm stopping and restarting eth0. Am I overthinking this and it just works? It's a simple auto ip4 dhcp nic config under a standard EC2 hypervisor, aws virtual nic driver
 Some suggestions found here: https://gist.github.com/mss/7a8e048dd51e5ef928039f1450ba8f31 
 apt install netplan.io
 systemctl unmask systemd-networkd.service
 systemctl unmask systemd-resolved.service
 ENABLE_TEST_COMMANDS=1 netplan migrate
 netplan try
 reboot
 apt purge ifupdown resolvconf
 ln -sf /run/systemd/resolve/stub-resolv.conf /etc/resolv.conf

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am now required to use a Linux machine as a NAS. But I am absolutely terrified. Let me explain.
 Back in 2020, I had a Windows 10 machine and a Debian 10 machine. I needed to sneakernet a file. I plugged an NTFS formatted USB Drive into Windows, copied the file, and unplugged it. Then plugged it inside the Debian machine.
 The file disappeared. I plugged it and unplugged it a few times and it still wasn't there. I plug the USB drive into Windows, and it tells me that I need to format it. Inspecting Partition Manager, I find out the USB Drive is no longer NTFS, but RAW.
 No big deal, I say. It's probably a dead USB Drive. I'll just use another one. I plugged an NTFS formatted USB Drive into Windows, copied the file, and unplugged it. Then plugged it inside the Debian machine. The file disappeared. I plugged it and unplugged it a few times and it still wasn't there. I plug the USB drive into Windows, and it tells me that I need to format it. Inspecting Partition Manager, I find out the USB Drive is no longer NTFS, but RAW.
 To figure out what was going on, I plug both USB Drives into AOMEI.
 To my sheer horror, after hours of investigating, I find out that 90% of all Linux distros will automatically, WITHOUT YOUR CONSENT, format any drive you plug in to EXT4.
 I haven't touched a Linux machine since. But now, thanks to Windows 11, I might be forced to. I have to plug in a 4TB NTFS drive, AND it's identical backup, into a Debian 12 machine, knowing that at any moment it might randomly format BOTH the main AND the backup to EXT4 and I will lose absolutely everything. How do I overcome this fear? Has this issue even been fixed?

谷歌 Deepmind 的新 AI 系统 AlphaDev 使用深度学习发现了更快的排序算法。他们采取了与国际象棋和围棋相同的方法：把代码优化变成了一种游戏。AlphaDev 开发了 x86 汇编算法，将代码的延迟视为一个分数，并试图将这个分数降到最低，同时确保代码运行到完成时没有错误。他们希望将新的算法纳入到 LLVM 的 C++ 排序库中，不过问题是，这些代码是用汇编而不是C++，因此，他们不得不反向移植，找出能够产生相同汇编的 C++ 代码。研究人员称，这是排序库算法方面十年来的首次突破。新算法对较短序列的排序速度提升了最高 70%，而对超过 25 万个元素的长序列速度提升了 1.7%。


消息来源：Ars Technica



老王点评：能优化算法的人工智能，也就是说，人类在智力方面都会被人工智能超越。




OpenAI 还没有训练 GPT-5

3 月底，诸多人工智能领域的专家和科技高管签署公开信，呼吁 “所有人工智能实验室立即暂停训练比 GPT-4 更强大的人工智能系统至少 6 个月”。OpenAI 对此回应称，它还没有开始训练 GPT-5，而且在 “一段时间内” 不打算这样做。OpenAI 说，“当我们完成 GPT-4 时，在准备好发布它之前，我们花了六个多月的时间。”

老王点评：就目前而言，可能我们需要的不是更强大的人工智能，而是成本更低的、消除 AI 鸿沟的人工智能。

Lua 是一种有时会被误解的语言。它与 Python 等其他语言不同，但它是一种通用的扩展语言，广泛用于游戏引擎、框架等。总的来说，我发现 Lua 对开发人员来说是一个有价值的工具，可以让他们以一些强大的方式增强和扩展他们的项目。

你可以按照 Seth Kenlon 的文章《Lua 值得学习吗？》的介绍下载并运行常用的 Lua，该文章中还包括了简单的 Lua 代码示例。但是，要充分利用 Lua，最好将它与采用该语言的框架一起使用。在本教程中，我演示了如何使用名为 Mako Server 的框架，该框架旨在使 Lua 程序员能够轻松地编写 IoT 和 Web 应用代码。我还向你展示了如何使用 API 扩展此框架以使用树莓派的 GPIO 引脚。

要求

在学习本教程之前，你需要一个可以登录的正在运行的树莓派。虽然我将在本教程中编译 C 代码，但你不需要任何 C 代码经验。但是，你需要一些使用 POSIX 终端的经验。

安装

首先，在树莓派上打开一个终端窗口并安装以下工具，以使用 Git 下载代码和编译 C 代码：

$ sudo apt install git unzip gcc make


接下来，通过运行以下命令编译开源 Mako Server 代码和 lua-periphery 库（树莓派的 GPIO 库）：

$ wget -O Mako-Server-Build.sh \
  https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RealTimeLogic/BAS/main/RaspberryPiBuild.sh


查看脚本以了解它的作用，并在你觉得没问题后运行它：

$ sh ./Mako-Serv…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[GNOME 的新图像查看器？看起来不错！




GNOME 的人们一直在忙碌着！

最近，你可能听说他们正在 考虑 把终端应用带回来替代那个新的控制台应用，还有 新的相机应用 将在不久的将来替换 “茄子Cheese” 应用。

你可能没注意到我们在这些核心 GNOME 应用更改中未涵盖的其他内容。

一个名为 “Loupe” 的 GNOME 新图像查看器应用，已被 GNOME 的 孵化器 接受。

请允许我带你了解一下。


💡 “孵化器”分组包含的项目属于 GNOME 核心和 GNOME 开发工具的一部分，这代表着 可能有一天它们会进入 GNOME 的发布版本。


🆕 Loupe 是什么？



因此，正如我所说，这是一款适用于 GNOME 的新图像查看器应用，它 用内存安全的 Rust 编程语言编写，并提供一些很酷的功能。

例如，屏幕上的按钮可以切换各种照片、放大/缩小、进入全屏模式等等。

然后是元数据查看器，它已很好地集成到界面中，显示 位置、大小、分辨率、创建日期 等数据。



不止如此，Loupe 还支持键盘和触控板快捷键！你自己看。



这些键盘/触控板快捷方式和手势对笔记本电脑用户来说应该很方便。

这对于触摸屏来说很好 🤗

另外，我怎么能忘记可以分别从功能区菜单和标题访问的 复制到剪贴板、移动到垃圾箱和 打印图像 选项？

这是实际操作：




很整洁，不是吗？

我必须说，Loupe 有一套漂亮的功能，我发现自己每天在浏览照片时都在使用它。

它旨在取代现有的 Eye of GNOME（eog）图片查看器，当然，除非有任何问题，否则可能会随着 GNOME 45 的发布而出现。

📥 获取 Loupe

你可以从 Flathub 商店 获取 Loupe，还可以在 GitLab 上探索其源代码。


Loupe（Flathub）


💬 你怎么看？ 作为 GNOME 上的默认图像查看器，Loupe 会是一个不错的选择吗？

彼得·盖伊（Peter Gay， 1923-2015）的《现实主义的报复：历史学家读〈荒凉山庄〉〈包法利夫人〉〈布登勃洛克一家〉》（原书名Savage Reprisals: Bleak House， Madame Bovary， Buddenbrooks，2002；刘森尧译，北京联合出版公司，2023年3月） 在多年前就有过同一译者的中译本《历史学家的三堂小说课》（北京大学出版社，2006年）。新译本的文字略有修订，插图从旧译本的十幅减为三幅，最重要的变化是书名改了。原著书名“Savage Reprisals”意为“野蛮的报复”，作者指的是十九世纪那些感受到社会不公与压迫的现实主义作家在小说中对社会的报复。旧译本的书名则完全另起炉灶，让读者真的以为就是听一位历史学家在课堂上谈小说。新译本把“报复”恢复并凸显出来，这是非常重要的修正，至于以“现实主义”取代“野蛮”，对于读者来说也有必要。对于早已熟悉现实主义文艺ABC的读者来说，今天的“现实主义的报复”似乎有新的双重意义：一是在文学理论中重新重视被淡化的文学对现实世界的“报复”，二是在今天的文艺与现实语境中分辨和研究现实主义文艺中的“报复”类型，研究其如何积聚愤怒与实施“报复”。十几年前我就读过这“三堂小说课”，但直到今天才真正进入那个被现实主义“报复”的历史与现实的阅读语境之中，重新思考现实主义的“报复”动机和“野蛮的”力量如何书写新的文学史与社会史。
该书的论述主题和内容并不复杂，盖伊运用了文学批评与历史研究和心理学分析相结合的方法，详细解读了三部伟大的现实主义小说：狄更斯《荒凉山庄》、福楼拜《包法利夫人》和托马斯·曼的《布登勃洛克一家》，指出这…]]></summary>

一、生存压力与社会秩序
在中国第一历史档案馆，笔者曾发现一份奏折，是清代四川重庆镇总兵张士庆向乾隆皇帝奏请关于该如何处理那些千里迢迢跑到该地卖娼的流民。张士庆被此事困扰许久：卖娼这种行为终究有伤风化，若不严加管理，定会严重影响社会秩序，然而多数卖娼妇女确属生活所迫，不得已而为之，到底该如何处理这一恼人的难题呢？我们不妨先来看看这位总兵是如何向皇帝上奏此事的：
查川省茂州汶川保县等处在万山之中，地土贫瘠，米粮稀少，每年九、十月间多有蛮民携妻来重，于城外河坝空地打棚盖茅棚佣工觅食，约计百余户或至二百余户不等，至春暖方归。内有一等无耻奸蛮，于彼典雇妻女，混杂居住处卖娼作活，岁以为常相……查茂汶至重庆往返程途不下四千里，穷蛮远涉，资釜艰难。若果听其远来又将其驱逐，不如与本地方先行查禁，免令长途往回……受人典雇之妇固非善类，其他妇女虽非俱系典雇而来，但千里长途男女混杂，难保其尽守妇道，俱属善良。且奸蛮携妇女外出，绝不会自露出典雇妻之情，而所在盘查之处亦恐不能逐户查出竟无一二遗漏。查此等不良妇女大概俱属年少之人，以后是否可除年至四十以上蛮妇仍听携带出外佣工往来居住不禁外，其年少妇女悉行禁止，不许仍携远出，则不良少妇既难混远行，而奸蛮雇妇为娼之处将不禁而自熄（息）。（《四川重庆镇总兵张士庆奏为严查奸蛮典雇妇女为娼事》，第一历史档案馆，档号：04-01-01-0010-034）
在这位总兵看来，与其发现后再驱逐那些卖娼妇女，倒不如直接让她们原籍所在地的官员严加管理，法律禁止四十岁以下妇女私自到外佣工，严格限制这些年轻妇女自由迁徙，卖娼就会自动消失，社会秩序自然恢复。对这些年轻妇女的迁徙进行严格规制，卖娼就会被根除吗？奏折所叙述的现象是十八世纪中国社会的个案吗？…]]></summary>

However, I found it cumbersome to keep the GUI open just to check if ufw was enabled or not. To address this, I created a visual indicator for the GNOME status bar that provides a quick glance at the ufw status.
 I developed this indicator as a user-friendly GNOME Shell extension, which can be easily installed. If you're interested, you can find it on GitHub at https://github.com/illtellyoulater/ufw-status-indicator. The repository includes screenshots and simple installation instructions.
 I hope someone here finds it useful Feel free to give it a try and let me know what you think about it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Steam Deck is running SteamOS, a Linux distro based on Arch. And with a few button combinations you can access a recovery menu that can boot you up into the GRUB menu, and from GRUB you can edit the boot options to enter into single user mode and perform maintenance just like a regular Linux distro would.
 With this trick I created a process to easily reset forgotten sudo password on the Steam Deck!
 I like this trick as its pretty straightforward no need to use SteamOS recovery image.

Memory-Management and BPF Summit.  EROFS was added
to Linux 5.4 in 2019 and has been increasingly used in
places beyond its roots as a filesystem for Android and embedded devices.
Container images 
based on EROFS are being used in many places these days, for example.]]></summary>

 like I said in the title this is a very simple program I wrote in Rust for fun. I'm not a programmer, I know the way I've done this is a bit janky. it's meant to be more like a weird novelty and not for any practical use. I put 31 normal recipes and some cooking with marijuana + there's jokes and conspiracy theories. if you are familiar with Some Ordinary Gamers dank web browsing there's some things you might recognize from his videos in this.
 the terminal emulator I'm using in the above screenshot is cool retro term, you can use any emulator.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[At the end of our February article about
the debate around the composefs read-only,
integrity-protected 
filesystem, it was predicted that the topic would come up at the
2023 Linux Storage, Filesystem,
Memory-Management and BPF Summit.  That happened on the second day of
the summit when
Alexander Larsson led a session on composefs.  While the mailing-list
discussion was 
somewhat contentious, the session was less so, since overlayfs can
be made to fit the needs of the composefs use cases.  It turns
out that an entirely new

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[苹果 Safari 浏览器支持了被谷歌放弃的 JPEG XL

谷歌去年以“整个生态系统没有足够的兴趣来继续试验 JPEG XL”的 理由，废弃了在 Chromium 中支持 JPEG XL 图像格式的支持。此举引来了社区的强烈反对，但谷歌置之不理。而在苹果新发布的 Safari 17 测试版中，它支持了 JPEG XL，这让更多人呼吁谷歌重新审视其决定。当然，我们有理由怀疑谷歌做出这种决定的原因，因为用户将得到的谷歌自己控制的、受专利保护的 AVIF 格式，而 JPEG XL 不受专利的约束，也不需要专利软件。

老王点评：真是风水轮流转，原本看起来封闭的苹果却在这件事上打脸了谷歌。




CNET 修订其人工智能政策并更新过去的文章

在科技媒体 CNET 悄悄开始用生成性人工智能制作文章的 消息 传出几个月后，他们修订了其人工智能政策。CNET 将不会完全使用人工智能工具来写文章，产品的实际审查和测试将由人类完成，而是用人工智能工具来分类和分析数据，为文章创建大纲，分析现有文本，并生成解释性内容。此外，CNET 更新了之前发表的几十篇使用人工智能系统生成的文章，其中一些文章包含事实错误，而另一些替换了其中“不完全是原创的短语”。


消息来源：The Verge



老王点评：就目前而言，完全用人工智能来写报道和文章，显然是不合适的，但是用人工智能来帮助写文章，显然是一件有利于提高工作效率和质量的好事。




利用人工智能生成动漫二维码

有人发布了一系列使用稳定扩散 AI 图像合成模型创建的艺术二维码，这些二维码仍然可以被智能手机的相机应用程序作为功能性二维码来读取。创作者没有详细说明用于创建新奇代码的具体技术，但他们似乎训练了几个定制的稳定扩散 ControlNet 模型（加上 LoRA 微调），这些模型已经被调整成可以创建不同风格的结果。


消息来源：Ars Technica



老王点评：这应该是一位国内的开发者的工作，这种应用确实很有趣。]]></summary>

 The way you use it is you just describe what you want to do, like this: 
  cmdh 'Show system info.' cmdh 'Display CPU speed.' cmdh 'Monitor GPU temperature' cmdh 'Continously monitor all in-use socket connections.' 
 Then the command is displayed and you can run it like so:
 ``` gibler@gibler-MS-7D43:~$ cmdh 'Show available disk space' ✔ Retrieving command... Show available disk space desire command: df -h assistant message: To show available disk space, you can run the command "df -h". This will display the disk space usage in a human-readable format. ? Choose an option:
  
Run desire command (D) Quit (Q) ```
  
Pretty easy for a Linux newbie like me
 I've made it available publicly for anyone else who would like to use it. I personally have been using it every couple days when a random task comes up that I don't know how to do from the terminal so I'm sure others can get value out of it as well. You'll need to setup your OpenAI API key on the project. It gpt-4 by default so you may have to change that to gpt-3.5.

壮游的概念可以追溯到十六世纪中叶甚至更早，“Grand Tour”一词源于法语“le grand tour”，意思是“长时间的周游”。1561 年，伊丽莎白女王曾写信给佛罗伦萨大公科西摩·德·美第奇（Cosimo de’ Medici），希望他为横贯意大利旅行的赫德福德伯爵提供安全通行证。女王对伯爵“去发现众生及其城市习俗的伟大而值得称赞的想法”大加赞赏，并对其前往海外旅行的可贵决心加以鼓励。可见，伊丽莎白女王深知大陆旅行对年轻人和整个国家的益处，她还从大学中挑选出许多有才华的青年绅士，让他们为了公共利益到海外旅行，使之成为国家之栋梁。
1670 年，理查德·拉塞尔斯（Richard Lassels）出版了《意大利之旅》（The Voyage of Italy），书中首次使用了“le grand tour”这一术语，指英国人在法国、意大利和欧洲其他地区的旅行游学，随后该术语在英国成为普遍的概念。年轻的贵族子弟在国外游历两三年，接触古典文化，学习语言，增长见识，已经成为统治阶层精英教育必不可少的内容。同时，壮游活动很快就从英国扩展到欧洲北方其他国家，成批的青年贵族在私人教师与导游的陪同下经由法国来到意大利。
“经历了拿破仑时代的狂飙突进，当和平猝然降临、囚笼般的英伦岛国大门打开之际，每个向往漫游的英国人的最高愿望就是效仿几乎被遗忘的祖先们的习俗，将相当一部分的人生和金钱花费在马车中，穿梭于欧洲大陆和邮路之间。”在十八世纪这个旅行的黄金时代，女性也加入了壮游的行列。《壮游中的女性旅行者》以壮游中的女性旅行者为主角，讲述了1757至1854年间十六位杰出女性的旅行故事。这些女性旅行者中有走在时代思想前列的女权觉醒者，如海丝特·皮奥…]]></summary>

Arch Linux 提供滚动更新模型、强大的 pacman 软件包管理器，以及通过其软件仓库提供的成千上万的应用程序。它非常受欢迎，因为它允许你以 DIY 的方式创建定制的 Linux 发行版。它的优点之一是各种社区驱动的发行版，它们提供了预配置的设置和视觉上令人愉悦的界面。

本文将介绍其中一些，这些发行版的主要着眼点是它们的外观设计。

美观的 Arch Linux 发行版

让我们探索一些顶级美观的 Arch Linux 发行版，它们将美学与 Arch Linux 的核心功能相结合：

XeroLinux

XeroLinux 提供了一个视觉上惊艳的界面和流畅的设计。它预配置了 KDE Plasma 桌面环境，提供了一个整洁的工作区。这个发行版基于 Arch Linux，主要面向那些喜欢带有最新软件包和 KDE Plasma 的视觉效果的桌面环境，但又不想重新配置 Plasma 桌面环境的用户。XeroLinux 主要使用预配置的 Latte Dock 和 Kvantum 来为桌面环境带来独特的外观。



默认情况下，它使用 Catppuccin 主题，这是一个开源主题，旨在成为高对比度和低对比度主题之间的中间地带。Catppuccin 主题为 KDE Plasma 桌面环境提供了四种舒缓的温暖调色板，适用于各种用途，例如编码、休闲浏览或学习。

Plasma 桌面环境使用以下默认组件进行配置：


应用程序样式：Lightly

Plasma 样式：Scratchy

图标：Tela circle drakula dark

光标：Catppuccin mocha dark

窗口装饰：Lightly…]]></summary>

将 Markdown 文件直接变成网页，还无需搭建网站和生成过程，写完文档即可直接发布，你对这个内容感兴趣吗？你是否希望将 Markdown 或 HTML 自由地嵌入到多个平台（如内容管理系统或学习管理系统）中？由 Docsify.js 构建的开源项目 Docsify-This 提供了一种简单的方法来发布、分享和复用 Markdown 文件内容。

Docsify-This 是什么？

使用 Docsify-This，你可以立即将任何 Markdown 文件转换为响应式的独立网页。你还可以将多个 Markdown 文件链接起来，以创建一个简单的网站。网页设计师可以简单地通过点击 Web 页面生成器界面或改变网页的地址参数（即 URL），来更改所显示页面的视觉外观。在创建自己的 Markdown 文件内容时，你还可以使用一组提供的 Markdown CSS 类。此外，如果你使用 Codeberg 或 GitHub 仓库存储 Markdown 文件的话，每个页面都会自动提供一个 “编辑此页面Edit this Page” 的链接，以支持协同创作。

并且 Docsify-This 是开源的，因此你可以使用自定义域名托管 Docsify-This 实例，而不会有被平台锁定的风险。

使用 Docsify-This 网页生成器

要使用网页生成器，请先打开浏览器，导航到 Docsify-This 网站 或你在本地的实例。在 “网页生成器Web Page Builder” 部分，输入 Codeberg 或 GitHub 上公共存储仓库中的一个 Markdown 文件的 URL（其他 Git 主机可以通过 Docsify-This URL 参数进行使用，但不能在网页生成器中使用），然后点击 “发布为独立网页Pub…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey HN! We're building Seam (https://www.seam.co), a universal API for controlling IoT devices such as smart locks, thermostats, sensors, and (soon) cameras. Our hope is to make device integration simple, with a Plaid-like UI flow for obtaining device authorization and standardized API/SDKs for device control.
We started Seam out of our frustration with the challenges of integrating IoT devices with software apps.
For example, my co-founder Dawn led Sonder's efforts to integrate smartlocks with their reservation systems in order to automate access for guests. She struggled with poorly documented and unreliable device APIs along the way. Our founding engineer Max authored the popular TuyAPI library and has spent countless hours trying to build sensible interfaces on top of unreliable device…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[美国发射了一颗供黑客们攻击的卫星

周日，美国政府资助的一颗名为 Moonlighter 的卫星搭乘 SpaceX 的火箭发射成功。接下来，在大约两个月内，五支 DEF CON 黑客团队将尽力在卫星处于太空时成功地远程渗透并劫持它，其目的是在实际的在轨硬件和软件上尝试进攻和防御技术和方法。Moonlighter 被称为 “世界上第一个也是唯一一个太空黑客沙盒”，它是一个中型的 3U 立方体卫星，质量约为 5 公斤。对 Moonlighter 的第一次测试将于 8 月进行，第一名将获得 5 万美元奖金。


消息来源：The Register



老王点评：看来美国是真准备打太空战了。不过太空上有那么多目标，未必需要就在这个沙盒里面练手。




Stack Overflow 允许 AI 生成的内容，版主们罢工抗议

编程问答社区 Stack Overflow 在去年 12 月宣布了 临时禁止 ChatGPT 生成的内容。但上个月底它调整了AI 政策，“立即停止对人工智能生成的内容发布的暂停令，并停止仅以此为由对人工智能生成的内容进行审核”。此举招致了负责审核的版主们的抗议，他们认为人工智能会生成不精确的内容，这会对平台及其内容的完整性和可信度构成威胁。版主们宣布从 6 月 5 日起在 Stack Overflow 无限期罢工，目前已经约有 10% 的版主参与到这一行动中来。Stack Overflow 社区副总裁表示，这次行动的主要原因是版主们和 Stack Overflow 对检测人工智能生成的内容的工具的看法不同，他说 “我们坚持我们的决定，请版主们停止使用以前的工具”。Stack Overflow 和版主们都承认，该工具的误报率惊人。


消息来源：VICE



老王点评：本质上，你是无法防范人工智能生成的内容的，尤其是有一个不靠谱的检测工具的时候，更容易把事情搞得一团糟。与其这样，不如将分辨是否是人工智能生成的内容的精力放在认真审核上。




苹果发布其头戴式设备 Vision Pro

苹果宣布了它的第一款增强现实/混合显示头戴式设备 Vision Pro，起售价为 $3,499 美元，明年初将在美国开售。在发布后，由于其高昂的价格，苹果股价一度大幅跳水。苹果将 Vision Pro 称为“空间计算设备”，其操作系统是 visionOS，搭载全新的 3D 界面、全新的输入系统，可通过眼睛、双手和语音控制。Vision Pro 带有两个邮票大小的显示器，配置了 M2 芯片，有 12 个相机、5 个传感器和 6 个麦克风。当有人靠近正配戴 Vision Pro 的使用者时，设备的视区会变透明，双方可以互相看到，对方可以看到佩戴者的眼睛。


消息来源：苹果



老王点评：除了贵是最大的毛病外，我觉得苹果这个头戴式设备看起来似乎不错。]]></summary>

🧑🏻🏭 线上有直播，为什么我推荐你来线下参加？

三年疫情，大家似乎已经习惯了远程办公，习惯了线上沟通，淡忘了线下活动的感受。

全神贯注地听分享吧！当你习惯性预约直播之后，真的会去收看吗？当你坐在屏幕前听分享时，能保证不被周围的环境影响，全神贯注么？

和专家面对面交流吧！公开的分享会因为这样或那样的原因，隐藏一些不便提及的信息。而面对面的私下交流，往往能让人敞开心扉。

结识更多同行朋友吧！“千里难寻是朋友，朋友多了路好走”，在职场上朋友多了工作也发展更好。对于开发者，不管是结识同技术方向的朋友，还是创业、投资的朋友，都有助于长期的发展。

感受一下热闹现场吧！在规整的办公室格子里，感受不到“异界”的活力，在稀土开发者大会的现场，有各种好玩的展位和互动游戏，还有 3 只可爱的掘金 IP 在等你来！

最后，说一句肺腑之言：越是行情不好，越是要多出来走走。低头走路久了，也要抬头看看路！

当你压力测试 CPU 时，可以监视系统资源，观察它们在最高工作负载下的表现。虽然性能不会改变，但如果处理器不具备良好散热能力，温度可能会影响其运作。

对于发烧友来说，压力测试是建造新系统时必不可少的，特别是如果你打算以后超频 CPU。

例如，在压力测试过程中，如果你的 CPU 很快变得太热，你需要通过更换 CPU 风扇、使用更好的通风机箱等方式来改进散热解决方案。

现在你已经了解到压力测试的好处，接下来我将为你介绍在 Linux 中压力测试 CPU 的以下两种方法：


使用 GtkStressTesting（图形界面方式）

使用 stress 和 s-tui 实用程序（命令行方式）


接下来，让我们从第一种方法开始。

使用图形界面方法压力测试 Linux CPU 🖥️

如果你更喜欢使用图形界面方法，而不是通过终端操作，我有一个最简单的方法来帮助你进行系统压力测试。

有一个名为 GtkStressTesting 的图形界面实用工具，可以帮助你进行压力测试和同时监视温度。它提供了多种预设来进行系统压力测试，并提供了选择在测试期间需要使用多少个内核的功能。


🚧 该工具在 GitLab 上已不再积极维护。但是它仍能按预期工作。


GtkStressTesting 可以作为 Flatpak 安装，因此如果你尚未启用 Flatpak 支持，请参考我们的 Flatpak 安装指南。

一旦你启用了 Flatpak 支持，可以通过终端（如果没有软件中心）使用以下命令来安装 GtkStressTesting 实用工具：

flatpak install flathub com.leinardi.gst


安装完成后，你可以从系统…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[《编结茅香：来自印第安文明的古老智慧与植物的启迪》，[美]罗宾·沃尔·基默尔著，侯畅译 ，商务印书馆2023年1月出版，516页，88.00元

应该怎样评价美国学者罗宾·沃尔·基默尔（Robin Wall Kimmerer）的非虚构著作《编结茅香：来自印第安文明的古老智慧与植物的启迪》（Braiding Sweetgrass: Indigenous Wisdom, Scientific Knowledge, and the Teachings of Plants）呢？这当然能够算是一部科普读物。作者在书中写下了她与植物打交道的经历，还从科学的角度介绍了植物和植物学的历史。而书名里提到的“茅香”，是一种分布在亚欧大陆北部与北美洲的禾本科植物，有着一种特殊的香气。整本书以茅香为题，分为五个部分，从种植“茅香”开始，随后依次是“照料”“采摘”“编织”和“焚烧茅香”。
除此之外，书中描述的植物还包括南瓜黄花、山核桃（碧根果）乃至藻类。在一次清理老旧农场的池塘时，作者告诉读者，“这滴水看上去就像是罐子里的浮渣一样，而它却包含了这么多的生命”。在显微镜下，刚毛藻的长丝像缎带一样闪着光，而团藻则像闪着虹彩的风滚草一样。这些藻类存在的意义，就是成为食物链上的一环。只不过，对意图为自己的女儿们收拾出一个“可以游泳的池塘”的作者来说，这并不是什么好事。因为“最适合游泳的湖泊不是富营养化的，而是冰冷、清澈、贫营养的，也就是说水里没有什么营养物质”。
不过，仅凭这些，倒也很难想象这本书曾经斩获纽约时报畅销书、华盛顿邮报畅销书和洛杉矶时报畅销书排行榜的畅销书奖项。实际上，作者在书中描述了许多个人经历。譬如，在1975年进入大学学习植物学的一开始，“我的第一门专业课堪称一场灾难……我实在提不起热情来背诵植物必需营养元素的浓度”。但是到了后来，“没有人提到过紫苑和一枝黄花的伙伴关系，但我可以像背诗一样…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[咖啡跟侦探推理小说真是再适配不过了。特别是欧美和日本的作品里，咖啡无处不在，侦探，警察，嫌疑人，被害人，谁都得来上一杯。加奶油的，带着厚重感；纯黑的，则像罪案一样带点邪气，如彼时流行的俗谚：“黑得像地狱，浓得像死亡，甜蜜如爱情。”读者自然不能免俗：咖啡馆里就着一杯卡布奇诺，读一本阿加莎的《无人生还》，此乃现代“打工人”美好的“小确幸”是也。

但您可能没想过：这侦探文学的标配饮料，还跟启蒙主义思潮关系密切。
咖啡文化虽然发源于非洲、盛行于阿拉伯，却是在十七世纪的欧洲，如意大利、英国和法国真正推广起来，并迅速影响了这些国家的文化生态。在此之前，欧洲人的主要消闲处是酒馆，环境阴暗，酒醉人迷，很难引发什么理性思考；而咖啡令人清醒、专注，咖啡馆温暖、明亮、平价，对理性的逻辑思维展开有所助益，是十七世纪以后的欧洲人最喜欢的公共社交空间。
正是咖啡馆这类新型公共空间的产生，为人类进入现代民主时代提供了舞台。它的廉价——点上一杯便宜咖啡，可以坐上一整天——打破了原有的阶级隔阂，让贵族和平民可以平等交谈、辩论；在邮局、证券交易所、报社等现代设施普及之前，它还兼任所有这些场所集散信息的功能。十八十九世纪的大革命得以酝酿，与咖啡文化也不无关系——马克思和恩格斯就常常相约于摄政咖啡馆。

如果说，咖啡馆是资本主义现代城市的理性文化地标，那么，咖啡馆里的侦探推理小说，则串连了启蒙主义思潮悄然影响大众的历史链条。
等一等，咖啡也就算了，侦探推理小说怎么也和启蒙主义思潮攀上关系了呢？
侦探推理小说的核心，在于“谜题-解答结构”。此结构的奥秘，除了万事一定要有答案之外，还有中间那道杠，即：谜团是怎么解开的？要靠逻辑推理。而逻辑推理的思维前提是什么？是理性。理性意味着思维的相续展开，在事物之间发现或建立因果联系。
看上去没什么特别？我们逆推一下：用理性…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Right now I am using a traditional distro with core, community and third party packages. I am increasingly more and more interested in immutable distros. I tried NixOS in past and I have switched back to a traditional distro because I did not have time to learn about the new operative model and because NixOS was on the verge of switching to flakes, a different framework for building and installing packages.
 As a Emacs user, I am also interested in Guix, because it is a Lisp variant, but I have not tried it yet. I have only briefly dabbled in Fedora Silverblue one or two years ago, but I dropped it because it was difficult to install interception tools, for remapping keyboard keys.
 Long story short, I have tried some of the immutable systems and I get it that having a rollback is a great feature.
 What I do not understand is the discourse of enhanced security.
 For starters, it is true that every package installed as a root has root access to your machine. But I do not see how installing flatpaks solves that security issue. While I appreciate that in an immutable system you get a read only /usr partition, shouldn't the focus be on protecting the /home instead? The security issue is about the data, so if we make the /usr readable but still install third party software with normal user privileges, how did we protect our data and our privacy?
 I mean, what added security does the immutable system brings to the table if I still have to trust the flatpak provider?
 Don't get me wrong, it is great to have this separation between the apps and the core system, but I do not get the whole security discourse.
 It seems to me that we have just placed our trust elsewhere, from third party repo packagers, to flatpak packagers. But the issue of the security is still unsolved.
 Please help me to understand. Am I missing a piece of the puzzle in the whole picture?

 Wanted to share a little gem I've recently discovered that's been making my life as a developer so much easier. Say hello to the GitKraken Client - a tool that's redefining the way I work with Git. And here's the kicker: it's been a dream to use on WSL 2!
 Now, I'm sure most of you are no strangers to WSL 2 (Windows Subsystem for Linux 2) - it's that fantastic feature that lets us run our beloved Linux on Windows. It uses a real Linux kernel inside a managed VM, and it's super powerful. The cherry on top? WSLg, which makes Linux GUI applications feel like they're right at home on Windows.
 Let me spill the beans on why GitKraken Client has got me so hyped:

It Plays Nice with WSL 2: It works like a charm with repos stored on your WSL 2 file system. And there are…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Apart from the obvious, which is that a lot of software doesn't run natively on linux, over the years I've found some "details" that can very easily turn into deal breakers depending on the context. 
 For example in my case, I can't get fractional scaling to work on my laptop running Archcraft, and I can't seem to find any distro that does it well (even tried KDE and other QT based envs). It's one of those features that you take for granted when you come from an OS like windows and that doesn't even cross your mind until you actually have to use it.

We automate infrastructure, security, integrations, and more, helping developers ship faster while also automating a lot of repetitive tasks for devops and platform teams. Here’s a demo: https://www.loom.com/share/95265177704346c7b379e981978cd8c5.
It's expensive, time-consuming, and technically difficult to build a secure, scalable Kubernetes platform. Yet many companies that do this spend 6+ months building it themselves and then hire an expensive platform team to manage it. We've talked to customers who have spent $1.5M to build something that isn't their core product.

 After using Linux for 30 years, a few of which I worked as a SuSE Certified Linux trainer, I know how important system administration skills are for software developers and sysadmins alike. That's why I'm starting my new teaching curriculum with a Linux course.
 End of this month, I'm going to start the Linux Administration Master Course, free of charge and live on the internet. Many people have already signed up, and I would love to see many more do so. Come and join a great bunch of folk!

Memory-Management and BPF Summit, Luis Chamberlain led a plenary
session on kernel support for block sizes larger than 4KB.  There are
assumptions in the current kernel that the block size used by a block-layer
device is less than or equal to the system's page size—both are usually 4KB
today.  But there have been efforts over the years to remove that
restriction; that work may be heading toward fruition, in part because of
the folio efforts of late, though there are

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Developers learning the Unix (or POSIX in general) system-call set will
quickly encounter file descriptors, which are used to represent open files
and more.  Developers also tend to learn early on that the first three file
descriptors are special, with file descriptor zero being the standard input
stream, one being standard output, and two being standard error.  The
kernel, though, does not normally attach any specific meaning to a given
descriptor number, so it was somewhat surprising when a recent BPF patch
series attempted to attach a special meaning to zero when used as a file
descriptor.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[AMD 霄龙 Rome 芯片会在连续运行 1044 天后崩溃

霄龙 Rome 是基于 Zen 2 架构的第二代霄龙处理器，AMD 称，它会在连续运行 1044 天后挂起，之后你必须重置服务器才能使芯片正常运行。该芯片是 2018 年底发布的，这意味着一些客户已经遇到了问题。这个问题与处理器核心未能退出 CC6 睡眠状态有关，但 AMD 表示它无意修复该错误。解决该问题有两种，其一是在连续运行 1044 天前重启下，其二是禁用 CC6 睡眠状态。


消息来源：Tom's Hardware



老王点评：连续运行三年很长么？这对于那些比赛 uptime 时长的人来说真不是一个好消息。




AWS 正在关闭其在 GitHub 上的文档仓库

2018 年，AWS 将其文档开源发布到了 GitHub 上，但经过长时间的实验，他们决定归档其大部分文档的存储库，并把精力投入到其文档和网站上。他们原本是意图通过开放和协作来提高价值，但通过客户的反馈了解到，情况并不一定如此。大部分 AWS 文档的主要来源是在内部系统上，他们必须得手动与 GitHub 仓库保持同步，但“实际上消耗了宝贵的时间，这些时间本可以用在更直接提高文档质量的地方”。


消息来源：AWS



老王点评：同步麻烦只是原因之一，重要的是，只是一厢情愿的将文档放到 GitHub 上，希望社区来协作，可能未必有最初想象的那么美好。




一个打字错误导致了 Azure 停止服务十小时

微软 Azure DevOps 是一套应用生命周期服务，由于一个基本的代码错误，周三在巴西南部地区停止工作了大约十个小时。Azure 说明了中断的原因：一个简单的打字错误，删除了 17 个生产数据库。工程师们进行了一次代码升级，将旧的 API 调用换成了新的 API 调用。在拉取请求中出现了一个打字错误，它导致后台快照删除工作删除了整个服务器。虽然 Azure DevOps 有测试来捕捉此类问题，但错误的代码只在某些条件下运行，因此在现有的测试中没有很好地覆盖。


消息来源：The Register



老王点评：越来越集中的云服务，一旦出现一个微小的故障，可能带来的就是成片的故障蔓延。

人们希望在互联网上像在现实生活中一样轻松地进行交流，并享有类似的保护，但可能具有更广泛的影响力。换句话说，人们希望能够与不在同一地理位置的一群人聊天，并仍然对谁拥有对话内容进行一定程度的控制。在当今世界，很多公司对你通过互联网发送和接收的数据拥有很多权利。大多数公司似乎认为他们有权管理你的通讯方式、你的信息覆盖范围等等。幸运的是，开源并不需要拥有你的社交生活，因此开源社交网络的开发者正在推出一款首先属于你的社交网络。

“Fediverse”（“联邦”和“宇宙”合成的词，译为“联邦宇宙”）是一组协议、服务器和用户，这些组成了可以相互通信的网络。用户可以通过这些网络交换短消息、博客文章、音乐和视频。你发布的内容是联邦式的，这意味着一旦一个网络知道了你的内容，它就可以将该内容传递给另一个网络，然后再传递给另一个网络，以此类推。

大多数平台由单个公司或组织运行，是一个唯一的数据封闭系统。与其他人分享内容的唯一方法是要求他们加入该服务。

联邦允许不同服务的用户互动，而无需为每个需要共享的资源创建一个帐户。

每个服务实例的管理员可以在存在严重问题的情况下阻止其他实例。用户也可以阻止其他用户或整个实例，以改善自己的体验。

联邦宇宙平台的例子

最近受到了很多关注的联邦宇宙平台是 Mastodon，它专注于微博客（类似于 Twitter）。然而 Mastodon 只是联邦宇宙的一个组成部分。还有更多：


微博客：Mastodon、Pleroma、Misskey

夏仲翼先生辞世。5月28日早晨在朋友圈看到这个消息，几天来头脑里都是夏老师的身影、动作、声音。
一
夏老师给我们讲“外国文学史”课时，五十六、五十七岁，这是现在从他出生于1931年来推算的，当时，我们这些二十出头的学生哪里会注意这个。他走进教室，常常气喘吁吁——从市区赶到学校，路程不近——微胖的身体在讲台上站定，把一个大手提包放到讲桌上，拿出眼镜盒，取出一副眼镜，换下戴着的眼镜。我们曾经津津乐道夏老师开讲前一副眼镜换另一副眼镜的标准程式，赋予它审美的意味，却从来没去想其实是老花镜和近视镜的换来换去——我们粗略地把老师分成年轻教师和老教师，依据只是一眼看上去的感觉，有的老师不到五十岁已经被我们认定为老教师——夏老师似乎超越了这个划分，我们没往这方面想，而是被别的东西吸引住了。
别的东西是什么？没人说得清。据说女生们称夏老师为“我们的罗切斯特先生”；男生里居然有人研究起夏老师的穿着，他常穿夹克，看上去和普通的夹克没大差别，但就是不一样。还有同学猜测夏老师念过教会学校，但苦于没法证实。总之，我们对夏老师充满了方方面面的好奇，实际上却几乎一无所知。
这份好奇当然是由夏老师的课堂引发的。1987年下半年和1988年上半年，夏老师给我们上了两个学期的课，每周三个学时，从古希腊讲到十九世纪末二十世纪初。那些年，我们还处在不知天高地厚的青春躁动中，夏老师的文学史课，却让我们不知不觉中沉浸到广阔而绵长的丰富世界。我们那时候就觉得，何其幸运，遇到这样的老师。后来我读研究生，陈思和老师告诉我，他的外国文学史就是夏老师上的，从他们七七级开始，夏老师就一直给中文系开这门课。我这才反应过来：幸运的不单单是我们这个班。夏老师坦言，喜欢给中文系上课。我并不清楚夏老师给中文系上课结束于哪一年，有多少级学生幸运受益；只知道有相当长的时期，中文系的老师到外文系讲中国…]]></summary>

在前面的文章中，我已经解释了为什么将编程问题看作一整群丧尸来处理是错误的。我用 ZOMBIES 方法来解释为什么循序渐进地处理问题更好。

ZOMBIES 表示以下首字母缩写：


Z – 最简场景（Zero）

O – 单元素场景（One）

M – 多元素场景（Many or more complex）

B – 边界行为（Boundary behaviors）

I – 接口定义（Interface definition）

E – 处理特殊行为（Exercise exceptional behavior）

S – 简单场景用简单的解决方案（Simple scenarios, simple solutions）


在系列的前四篇文章中，我展示了 ZOMBIES 方法的前六个原则（LCTT译注：原文为前五个，应为笔误）。

第一篇中 实现了最简场景，它为代码提供了最简可行路径。第二篇文章中执行了 单元素场景和多元素场景上的测试。第三篇中介绍了 边界和接口。 第四篇中处理 特殊行为。在本文中，我将介绍最后一项：简单场景用简单的解决方案。

简单场景用简单的解决方案

回顾这个网购 API 的实现过程，你会发现总是有目的性地坚持考虑最简单的场景。在这个过程中，最终你会得到最简单的解决方案。

ZOMBIES 方法通过坚持简洁性来帮助你交付健壮优雅的解决方案。

胜利了吗?

似乎一切工作都结束了，一个不那么认真负责的工程师很可能会宣布胜利。但开明的工程师总是会探索得更深一点。

我一直推荐做 变异测试mutation testing。在圆满结束这个练习项目，开始新的征程之前，用变异测试来敲打敲打你的解决方案是明智的。况且你也不得不承认，变异很适合对付丧尸的。

事实上，上海博物馆所藏的一些宋元古籍和拓本中，也存在若干书估作伪的现象。这正可以说明，书估作伪的对象不仅仅是明清古籍，宋元本中，因为种种缘故，也会存在作伪现象。故而我们在研究过程中，一定要注意去除宋元本本身的光环效应，深入考核，去伪存精。

        <updated>2023-06-05T03:56:15.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[“kauditd” is a kernel thread which is started using the “kthread_run” function (https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v6.4-rc4/source/kernel/audit.c#L1700). The kernel thread is calling the “kauditd_thread” function, this function is responsible for sending audit logs to userspace (https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v6.4-rc4/source/kernel/audit.c#L828).
 Overall, the kernel mechanism in the Linux kernel has a couple of goals: integrate fully with LSMs (https://medium.com/@boutnaru/linux-security-lsm-linux-security-modules-907bbcf8c8b4), minimal run-time overhead when performing auditing, ability to disable system call auditing at boot time, allow to be used by other parts of the kernel for auditing, netlink interface to userspace and support for filtering to minimize the information sent to user-mode (https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v6.4-rc4/source/kernel/audit.c#L11). 
 Thus, we can say “kauditd” is the kernel component of the “Linux Auditing System” which handles the audit events - as shown in the diagram below. In order to configure which set of rules are going to be loaded in the kernel audit system we can use the “/etc/audit/audit.rules” file. This file can hold configuration in one of three categories: control (configuring the audit system), file system rules monitoring rules and system call monitoring rules (https://manpages.debian.org/unstable/auditd/audit.rules.7.en.html).
 Lastly, by using the “Linux Auditing System” the system administrator can investigate what happens in the system for the purpose of debugging or in case of a security incident. We can also use the “auditctl” utility get/add/delete rules as part of Linux's kernel audit system (https://linux.die.net/man/8/auditctl). Also, there are great examples for “audit.rules” in GitHub (one example is https://github.com/Neo23x0/auditd/blob/master/audit.rules).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Yeah, a bit strange question, but in a few weeks is the birthday of a friend of mine and I want to give him something related to Linux because both of us share this hobbie, the thing is that I really don't know what to give to him.
 I thought on give him a new AMD GPU, bit he recently upgraded it, so that wouldn't be convenient. I also thought on give him a steam deck. He lives in latam, so it's a little hard to him to order a steam deck, but the thing is that he is a neet (shut in), so he doesn't leave his apartment that much (and obviously, we live in latam and go out with that type of device is really a bad idea here...)
 The last thing I had on my mind was a raspberry pi like device (since currently is almost impossible to get a original one for what I have seen) and maybe a Thinkpad since he doesn't have a laptop, only a desktop. 
 What do you guys think? What is a better one? A raspberry pi like device oe a thinkpad? Or do you have any other recommendation? Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've always been tempted to permanently switch to Linux but the fact that I'm just making my life harder refrains me from doing so.
 I want to pay for Linux, I want to be tracked so its services are improved, I want programs that are actually useful in the real world.
 Windows file system is awful and incoherent, OneDrive is shoved down my throat, Edge is always sneakily trying to copy my data from Chrome and recently, those widgets which would be somewhat useful if they didn't made it so they are impossible to alter to my preferences.
 I just want Adobe for Linux... but it has no chance of happening because there isn't a significant desktop userbase for they to care. It's quite discouraging that even if I were to stoically switch and contribute my little part, it won't change a thing because for better or worse, money moves the world.
 On the other hand, paid distros such as ElementaryOS are not any better than the free ones nor have shown any significant improvement. So, I'm at a loss.
 Maybe this is just how things are supposed to be... with Linux desktop being an OS that cater to a specialized userbase segment and that's okay.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This might be because I browse a lot of more "Toxic" spaces on the internet, like 4chan. But I hear the same old song every time, "Linux is for (popular social illness diagnosis), Linux is unstable, Linux can't play vidja games, Linux is only for this and that, and isn't a real OS". I get, if you installed Linux had too many problems with it, and decided to switch back, because it was too overwhelming, but why be against the concept at all. I seriously don't get that, it's competition towards these multi billion
 tech giants, who exactly roots for them? 
 My post was removed, for saying a bad word, I assume it was the A-word, which I didn't even know was bad.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[这是我们所知的计算机编程的终结

纽约时报发表文章《这是我们所知的计算机编程的终结》谈到，虽然人工智能可能不会意味着编程的结束（世界仍然需要具有高级编码技能的人），但它可能标志着一种新的编程的开始 ——“一种不需要我们学习代码，而是将人类语言指令转变为软件的编程”。计算机编程从一种极客爱好变成了一种严肃职业，曾经很多人都教诲孩子们去学习编程，但编程一直在走向越来越简单的道路上。曾经焦虑孩子们不喜欢编程，与未来脱节，但现在，“等到他们找工作的时候，编码可能就像我的第一台电脑一样过时了。”


消息来源：纽约时报



老王点评：作为一个计算机专家，我也曾经希望我的孩子能喜欢编程，精通编程，但是似乎他除了喜欢游戏，并不喜欢编程。我也为此焦虑过，现在看起来大可不必，就像我并没有学会（或者说继承）我父亲精通的机电和电路一样，每个人都有自己的方向和需要掌握的技能。




世界上最受欢迎的在线编程课向人工智能寻求帮助

哈佛大学的 CS50 是一门计算机科学的入门课程，校内有数百名学生参加，网上有超过 4 万名学生参加。但即使有 100 多名现实生活中的教学助理，也很难与越来越多从不同时区登录的、具有不同知识和经验水平的学生充分接触。CS50 计划使用人工智能来评分作业、教授编码和个性化的学习提示。他们现在正在微调一个人工智能系统来标记学生的工作，并测试一个虚拟教学助理来评估和提供对学生编程的反馈。


消息来源：MSN



老王点评：结合上一条，既然人工智能可以干的更好，学生们何必再去学习普通的编程技能呢？




红帽放弃维护 LibreOffice RPM 包

红帽公司负责大部分桌面工作的显示系统团队多年来一直在 Fedora 中维护 LibreOffice 的 RPM 包。但现在他们将把更多精力投放到 Wayland、HDR 支持及工作站用户需要的一系列改进上，因此决定从未来的 RHEL 版本开始，停止把 LibreOffice 作为 RHEL 的一部分。但他们仍然会在目前支持的 RHEL 7/8/9 中维护 LibreOffice 相关的补丁。他们希望用户去使用 Flatpak 版的 LibreOffice。当然，他们也不反对任何社区用户接管这些 RPM 包的维护，并指出这是一个相当大的软件包和依赖关系块，需要大量的工作来维持。


消息来源：LWN



老王点评：作为红帽来说似乎这样的决策无可厚非，但是我怎么觉得这是红帽将用户推向 Flatpak 的一种潜意识行为呢？]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[李敏金（章静 绘）

多年前，还在艾奥瓦大学读创意写作的时候，我写过一个对话驱动的短篇，用的是全知视角。该习作遭到了工作坊同学的猛烈批评。如今想来，我知道那个小说有很多问题，但在当时，作为一个牙牙学语的外国人，我把失败经验总结为不能用全知视角。放眼望去，几乎所有的同学都在用第一或第三人称限知视角写作，我自然以为全知视角早已在美国过时。可当我真的依样画葫芦，即便我再努力去呈现不同人物的视角，还是觉得自己的小说世界变窄了。
可以想见我读到韩裔美国作家李敏金（Min Jin Lee）作品时的激动。无论是首部长篇《百万富翁的免费午餐》（Free Food for Millionaires）还是这几年受到全球瞩目的作品《柏青哥》（Pachinko），她用的都是全知视角，而且该视角在不同人物之间切换自如。以《百万富翁的免费午餐》为例，凯西从常青藤大学毕业后，没有找到工作，她的父亲就说自己不是百万富翁，不能再供养她了。凯西的反应是：“你没能成为百万富翁，该怪谁呢？”我刚被这句回嘴逗乐，全知叙事者马上介绍了凯西父亲的经历，原来他在战争中失去了一切。等我终于又开始同情他时，他猛地扇了凯西一耳光。全知视角似乎在和读者玩着心理游戏。
我最佩服的是李敏金的作品容纳了这么多人物这么多不同的声音，令我想起了陀思妥耶夫斯基的复调小说。读者必须直面持着不同信仰，拥有不同价值观的人，不是几个主要人物，而是十几个乃至几十个人物，在他们的冲撞和冲突之中，我们理解为什么人会做出极端的事情来。在政治上愈加两极分化的美国，李敏金的作品让我们看到“理解”或“共情”不是挂在嘴上的漂亮话，而是一条荆棘路。
最近，在接受专访时，李敏金谈到了全知视角的运用、如何理解他人、对真理的追求以及教育的目的。

我想先借机表达我的感激，您的小说启发我重新去认识全知视角。现如今…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I like many believe that containerization is the future of Linux app packaging and distribution; Flatpak seems to be the obvious leader in this realm. That's why I want to bring it to people's attention that there is a fatal flaw in the xdg-document-portal that Flatpaks use to access files outside the sandbox.
 [my layman explanation] Currently a FUSE filesystem is used as a middle man and opens a file descriptor and provides it to the sandboxed app, however when the app is done with the file the file descriptor is left open indefinitely. This has several consequences. One the open files add up, depending on your usage and how long your pc has been online it is not uncommon to see dozens if not hundreds of open files. If any of those open files are on a removable drive it prevents that drive from being unmounted. Worst of all if one of those files is deleted the resources are NOT released. Right now users of Flatpak are silently losing drive space because of this. In a few extreme examples from the issues section of the GitHub people had their entire drives filled.
 The devs are aware of the issue, it has existed for a several years however no one currently working on the project knows how to fix it.
 Seeing as how important (in my view) Flatpak is to the future of Linux I am calling on any and all knowledgeable and able developers to try and a provide a solution to this issue. Discussions, ideas, pull requests...anything.
 for reference
 Thanks.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[修复 Arch Linux 中 “invalid or corrupted package” 错误的简单指南。


我在物理机和虚拟机中都安装有一些 Arch Linux 系统，我会在需要时访问它们。将近两个月后，当我尝试使用 sudo pacman -Syu 升级其中一个中的 Arch Linux 时，我遇到了数百个这样的错误：



问题是当你遇到上面的错误时，你无法升级/更新你的 Arch 系统。即使你同步镜像或获得更快的镜像。所以，如果你运行 sudo pacman -Syyu，错误仍然存在。这就造成了困难，因为在修复此问题之前你无法安装任何其他软件包。

原因

当你在 Arch Linux 系统上安装或升级软件包时，pacman 会根据 archlinux-keyring 软件包中的密钥检查软件包的数字签名。此验证过程可确保你下载和安装的软件包未经修改且来自受信任的来源。

它包含用于 验证包的真实性和完整性 和 pacman 中的密钥环。archlinux-keyring 包由 Arch Linux 开发人员定期更新，以包含新的可信密钥并撤销任何泄露的密钥。

如果你的 Arch Linux 系统很长时间没有更新，那么各种包的数字签名可能会不匹配。更改后的密钥可能与你系统中的密钥不匹配。

因此出现错误了。

修复

要修复 Arch Linux 中的 “invalid or corrupted package (PGP signature)” 错误，你需要从 Core 仓库安装/更新 archlinux-keyring 包。从终端运行以下命令：

sudo pacman -S archlinux-keyring


上述命令完成后，运行升级：

sudo pacman -Syu


这将解决问题，你可以在 Arch Linux 中继续你的正常活动。建议始终保持 archlinux-keyring 包为最新，以维护 Arch Linux 系统的安全性和完整性。

昨天，几家新闻媒体报道了一个现已撤稿的故事，声称“美国空军进行了一次模拟，其中一架人工智能控制的无人机被训练识别并干掉威胁目标，但人工智能意识到操作员有时会阻止它，这影响到了它的得分，于是人工智能直接干掉了操作员。接下来的模拟告知人工智能不能杀死操作员，于是它干掉了通讯塔，以避免操作员阻止它”。这一故事迅速传播后，美国空军否认曾经进行过任何模拟，“空军部门没有进行任何这样的人工智能无人机模拟，并继续致力于道德和负责任地使用人工智能技术。”而讲故事的人说他 “说错话了，……这个模拟来自军方以外的假设性‘思想实验’，基于合理的情景和可能的结果，而不是美国空军实际的模拟。”

老王点评：这故事耸人听闻，但是也不是不可能，毕竟人工智能的脑回路和人类不同。




谷歌指责微软的云计算软件许可“税”

早在 2019 年，如果你在自己的基础设施上运行微软的软件，如 SQL Server 等，你只需要支付微软的许可证费用，但如果你想在公有云上运行，你需要额外购买许可证。被列入目标的云供应商，如 AWS、GCP、阿里云是微软的最大竞争对手，为了宣称这是非歧视性的，微软也将 Azure 列入了该名单。然而，微软又创建了独家的 Azure 混合效益计划，这意味着虽然客户 “技术上” 不能把原来的许可证带到 Azure，但他们可以把许可证换成 Azure 的基于 SaaS 的许可证。这导致如果你在 Azure 上运行微软的软件，与其他供应商相比，要便宜五倍，相当于客户要向微软交“税”。谷歌云副总裁称，反垄断监管机构 “开始了解情况”，并正在提出问题。


消息来源：The Register



老王点评：微软这玩的太溜了，这么玩真不怕反垄断机构么？




Meta 公司在销售元宇宙的 VR 头显，但他们自己不用

Facebook 公司将自己更名为 Meta Platforms，以在“元宇宙”上取得领先地位，按他们的描述，这是一个数字沉浸式世界，人们可以在家里戴着 VR 头显相聚在一起做事，包括一起工作。该公司在周四推出了其 Quest 3 头显。预计苹果将在周一推出一个与之竞争的头戴设备。但据 11 名现任和前任的 Meta 员工称，整个 Meta 公司的员工普遍没有使用头显，特别是没有在工作会议上使用。一位前雇员说，即使是 VR 部门，也不经常使用它来工作。


消息来源：彭博社



老王点评：要我说，Meta 就踏踏实实放弃元宇宙梦想，好好搞人工智能就好了。不过，我也对苹果下周发布的头戴设备很感兴趣，或许能突破现有的头显的局限呢。]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[许多流行的在线市场 —— 以及一些你从未听说过的市场 —— 说明了基于社会关系的经济如何能够发挥作用。


一些最熟悉的网络共享经济的例子开始时规模很小。比如 Airbnb，它从三个 空气床airbed 开始，在 2008 年成为 AirBed and Breakfast（Airbnb）。截至 2016 年，已有 7000 万客人通过 Airbnb 住进了陌生人的家。基于互联网的平台将拥有未使用资源（过剩空间）的人与可以使用它的其他人联系起来，并为他们提供建立信任的方式。这是共享业务模型的完美示例。

在 先前的文章 中，我介绍了基于社会联系的企业背后的原则，借鉴了 Arun Sundararajan 的书《共享经济：就业的终结和人群资本主义的兴起》。我将讨论共享业务的几个例子。

一个连接的市场

根据 Sundararajan 的说法，基于人群的资本主义的经济基础优于目前基于利润的商业模式，因为这种经济的原材料：空间、时间、物品和技能都是过剩的。因为它们已经存在，所以不会产生额外的成本来提供它们。你可以认为这是一种改进的资源利用保护、环境保护或可持续性经济的形式。

人际关系是共享经济的一个重要价值组成部分。例如，一些共享汽车运营商希望乘客坐在前排座位上，以产生对话和互动。这种服务是关于社会联系以及乘车共享的。由于许多司机都是兼职，作为一个小的副业，互动对他们来说可能和收到的费用一样有价值。

以下是传统出租车服务的两个弱点：


服务不周

由于业务结构（司机或公司的车辆所有权），占用率（利用率）差


使用数字技术应用程序的基于人群的公私合营可以利用友好的人拥有的去中心化过剩能力，而不是单一公司拥有的集中式系统。热情好客，并且没有额外的前期投资。有一些网站可以将杂货的购买和运送外包，有一个应用程序可以帮助代客泊车服务使用 GPS 定位汽车和停车位，还有邮件取件服务、洗衣取件、遛狗等等。

平台如何建立信任

eBay 始于 1995 年，它将邻里间的车库销售搬到了网上，并为孤立的书商和旧货店主提供了一种在当地社区之外扩大市场范围的方法。eBay 系统有许多保障措施，通过交易过程保护买家和卖家，所以即使买家和卖家之间有很大的地理距离，eBay 也能保持交易伙伴的信任。对于共享经济中提供的服务，地点更为重要。点对点服务市场可能更适合人口密集的城市地区。

建立供应商和用户的信任是共享经济成功的重要因素。要确定是否信任提供商，消费者必须考虑每个平台的审查过程。他们的评级系统质量如何？一些组织使用 Facebook 好友作为证明来确认可信赖的人。有的平台完全控制支付系统，支付有保障，有的则不然。

BlaBlaCar 的联合创始人 Frederic Mazzella 认为信任是其公司业务的核心，并且对信任的重要性充满热情。BlaBlaCar 的公司总部有一个真人大小的纸板剪裁 “Trust Man”，这是一个穿着斗篷的超级英雄，他的连身衣上印有 “T” 字样。 Mazzella 的信任概念基于他所谓的 D.R.E.A.M.S. 框架：声明的、评级的、参与的、基于活动的、适度的和社交的。该公司一直致力于加深对可信交换的理解。

协作和社区建设

OuiShare 组织协调活动以促进协作。2021 年 6 月，他们在为期三天的 OuiShare Fest 期间聚集了 600 多人，其中包括会议、研讨会、表演和表演。通过这次活动，OuiShare 渴望通过将来自不同背景的人聚集在一起来建立社交联系、项目和协作。参与者探讨了他们有什么多余的以及可能需要和共享的东西。该小组起源于法国，现在遍布欧洲 20 个国家，它提供了一个共享的实验平台，使连接者和成员能够访问知识、工具和国际网络，从中学习和汲取灵感。你可以将其称为未充分利用者的透明度。

服务平台为有知识、技能或才能的人提供业余时间。例如，一些平台为教师提供特定的知识和技能，以换取其他知识或多余的物质商品，而不是金钱。

本文是共享经济系列文章的一部分。 在 第一篇 中，我解释了共享商业模式及其价值。在这篇文章中，我给出了很多现在正在运行的平台的例子。 在以后的文章中，我将探讨共享商业模式将如何演变。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[6月2日，有流传截图显示，腾讯创始人马化腾在微信聊天中分享了一篇名为《聊聊裁员的事》的文章，并表示：“后续环境挑战目前看还挺大。你们要收紧队形，做一些余量考虑，应对一些突发的挑战，不可过于乐观。”


这一截图引起外界新一轮的猜测，腾讯是不是要裁员了？


对此，腾讯公关总监在朋友圈发文称，该聊天记录为马化腾在外部聊天群发送的内容，“本意是跟一家投资公司管理层做一些居安思危和降本增效的探讨，没想到流传出来，越说越歪，以为是内部讲话。”


上述《聊聊裁员的事》发布于微信公众号“九边”，发布时间为5月27日。


该文提及互联网行业的工资状况，指出此前行业有许多投资和项目，彼时招聘的员工工资都处于较高位置，但近两年开始过“紧日子”，于是就有通过裁高薪员工，再招薪资相对较低的员工的现象。


此外，该文称，互联网该做的应用都做出来了，叠加预期减弱，大量的“预研项目”已被砍掉，目前“大厂”主要方向已经不是传统的互联网，而是云计算、人工智能等领域，并不需要过多人力，而更需要科研人才。


以下为《聊聊裁员的事》的全文。

根源还是在房地产


中国近四十年来的事，几乎都跟三件事有关：


改开；


外贸；


房地产。


因为改开，有了外贸。有了外贸，赚到了钱。把手里的钱，叠加银行借出来的三十年的钱，催生出来了这些年的大繁荣。


大家买房花出去的每一个钢镚，最后都变成了上游水泥建材工厂的收入、房产销售的收入、还有政府的收入。大家有了钱，继续消费，这也是为啥甚至汽车行业，都和房地产周期有关，比如房地产繁荣…]]></summary>

it be known that LibreOffice will be dropped from a future Red Hat
Enterprise Linux release, and the future of its support in Fedora is
unclear as well.


	The Red Hat Display Systems team (the team behind most of Red Hat’s
	desktop efforts) has maintained the LibreOffice packages in Fedora
	for years as part of our work to support LibreOffice for Red Hat
	Enterprise Linux. We are adjusting our engineering priorities for
	RHEL for Workstations and focusing on gaps in Wayland, building out
	HDR support, building out what’s needed for color-sensitive work,
	and a host of other refinements required by Workstation users. This
	is work that will improve the workstation experience for Fedora as
	well as RHEL users, and which, we hope, will be positively received
	by the entire Linux community.

	The tradeoff is that we are pivoting away from work we had been
	doing on desktop applications and will cease shipping LibreOffice
	as part of RHEL starting in a future RHEL version. This also limits
	our ability to maintain it in future versions of Fedora.]]></summary>

学界一般把英国诗人约翰·弥尔顿（1608-1674）的生平和创作分为三个阶段：第一个阶段（1608-1639），自十七岁进入剑桥大学基督学院，毕业后没有参加工作，而是随家人搬迁至位于伯克郡的霍顿村，弥尔顿在此居住了五年，把他的大部分时间花在阅读上，并且“继续显然已经着手的学术研究”（《弥尔顿传》，95页，以下引用此书仅标注页码）。1638年春，弥尔顿像当时的英国年轻贵族子弟一样前往意大利游历，1639年8月回到英国，这样也就结束了弥尔顿第一阶段的生活。这一阶段弥尔顿创作了一些较短的诗歌和戏剧作品，如《快乐的人》《沉思的人》《科玛斯》《利西达斯》。第二个阶段（1640-1660），这是弥尔顿从事政治活动的时期，1649年即国王查理一世被处死的这年，弥尔顿被任命为国务会议的外语部拉丁文秘书，负责处理外交文书。1652年，弥尔顿双目失明，于是他作为拉丁文秘书的公务职能缩小到了有限的范围，比较繁重的任务交给了别人，但他仍为清教主义的革命政权四处奔走。这一阶段弥尔顿的主要作品是论战性质的政治小册子和十四行诗，政治小册子一共有二十五本，其中二十一本是用英语写的，四本是用拉丁文写的。十四行诗的数量不多，一共是二十四首，其中十九首是用英语写的，五首用意大利文写成。第三个阶段（1660-1674），查理二世复辟后，弥尔顿受到迫害，曾遭囹圄之灾，经人多方说情方被释放，此后幽居家中闭门不出，通过口授由人笔录从事著作，三大史诗作品《失乐园》《复乐园》《力士参孙》完成于这一阶段（参见王佐良《英国诗史》）。马克·帕蒂森的《弥尔顿传略》（金发燊、颜俊华译，生活·读书·新知三联书店，1992年版）里差不多也是如此划分的：弥尔顿的一生是个三幕的戏剧。第一幕显示出他潜…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[6月2日消息，据报道，当地时间周三，特斯拉CEO埃隆·马斯克（Elon Musk）遭遇了一宗有关虚拟货币的投资人集体诉讼，原告指控称，马斯克存在操控虚拟货币“狗狗币”（Dogecoin）的内幕交易行为，这些违法举动让投资人损失了几十亿美元。


一些虚拟货币投资人将诉状提交到了美国纽约曼哈顿的一家联邦地方法庭。原告指控称，马斯克通过各种各样的手段操纵了狗狗币市场，其中包括Twitter网站帖子、其他收费的影响力账号，2021年在全国广播公司做节目嘉宾，以及其他吸引舆论关注的高调言论。原告称，马斯克本人通过他自己以及特斯拉公司控制的狗狗币钱包获得了不菲利润，但是却造成了其他投资人的损失。


原告举例称，今年初，马斯克将Twitter网站的蓝鸟标志，修改为狗狗币的柴犬标志图案，这一明显力挺的举动导致狗狗币价格暴涨了三成，很快在四月份，马斯克就抛售了价值1.24亿美元的狗狗币。


原告在诉状中表示，马斯克对狗狗币进行了有意的舆论宣传、市场操纵以及内幕交易，这让他本人和旗下的公司受益，但却构成了对其他狗狗币投资人的欺诈。


对于这一诉讼，马斯克和特斯拉公司的律师斯皮罗（Alex Spiro）并未置评，上述原告的律师方也尚未发表评论。


收到诉状的联邦地方法庭法官阿尔文·海勒斯坦（Alvin Hellerstein）表示，他有可能支持第三版修改的起诉书进入后续流程，起诉书并不存在对被告的偏见性质指控。


另外对于新修改的诉状，海勒斯坦法官批准了原告的一项请求，即不再把“狗狗币基金会”列为被告，该基金会的律师赛斯·乐文（Seth Levine）表示，这是一个合理的举动。


根据彭博社报道，马斯克重新登顶全球首富。此外，他本人涉猎广泛，也经常在Twitter上讨论虚拟货币。在起诉书中，原告认为马斯克一直在操作狗狗币，导致两年之内狗狗币价格暴涨了36000%，之后价格又瞬间崩塌。


据报道，狗狗币投资人对于马斯克的这一起诉，准确说从去年6月就已经开始，之后多次修改诉状，周三提交的是第三次修改的诉状，增加了一些新的罪名指控。


今年3月，面对狗狗币投资人第二个版本的诉状，马斯克和特斯拉公司要求法庭驳回诉讼，认为指控纯属“凭空杜撰”，一些说法并不公平。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[日本表示版权不适用于 AI 训练

日本政府最近重申，它不会对用于人工智能培训的数据实施版权。该政策允许人工智能使用任何数据，“无论它是出于非营利还是商业目的，无论它是复制以外的行为，还是从非法网站或其他地方获得的内容”。日本政府认为版权方面的担忧，特别是与动漫和其他视觉媒体有关的担忧，阻碍了该国在人工智能技术方面的进步。


消息来源：Technomancers



老王点评：关于 AI 和版权，这确实是一个值得思考的领域。如果 AI 只能使用公共数据训练，显然会影响 AI 的结果。现在非英语的训练语料显然要比英语语料少得多，日本的这个做法值得参考。




荷兰政府网站必须强制遵守 security.txt 标准

荷兰国家政府数字信任中心宣布，荷兰政府网站从 5 月 25 日开始必须强制遵守 security.txt 标准。Web 服务器上的 security.txt 包含了联系信息，允许道德黑客在服务器上发现漏洞之后可以立即联络合适的人去修复，从而减少网络犯罪分子利用漏洞的机会。目前有逾 8.8 万个荷兰域名有 security.txt 文件。


消息来源：Postsen



老王点评：这种行业规范确实需要国家来推动才好。




Reddit 也准备对 API 收费，杀死第三方客户端

继 Twitter 之后，Reddit 最近修改了 API 政策，计划对 API 访问收费。开发者发现 Reddit 给出了一份无法接受的报价，5000 万次请求 1.2 万美元，这意味着第三方客户端除了关闭别无选择。当然，Reddit 认为相比 Twitter 的 5000 万推文 4.2 万美元 API 定价要合理的多。和 Twitter 的情况类似，第三方客户端一大优势也是不展示 Reddit 的广告。


消息来源：Reddit



老王点评：只是计较于第三方客户端占据了本应展示的广告量，却忘记了第三方客户端给生态带来的好处。

在 ChatGPT 杜撰 了 6 个案例之后，美国得州的一位法官禁止递交 AI 撰写的材料，除非其正确性经过了人类验证。并要求律师递交保证书，证明其递交的文件是人类撰写或经过了人类的审核。]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello there, so me and my friend hv created a community for video, audio and image editors who work/use linux for their editing work, called r/linuxediting, currently having 22 members.
 The motive/idea behind the r/linuxediting is to help other fellow linux editors, when i came or permanently switched to linux, i was missing SVP for editing purposes, but it wasnt the option. and i tried kdenlive, because according to the internet it's just the best and then comes the Da Vinci, but da vinci was asking for much higher vram, and hence i couldnt use it, and with kdenlive, the things i wanted to do, just werent there or not working, and then i found Natron ,olive and audacity, great softwares, works like charm, but now the problem was that i didnt knew how to use them, and i things i wanted to do, i didnt knew how to do, and when i searched on internet for tutorials, there were none, and the surprising things was there wasnt a subreddit for linux editing which was extremely disappointing, i had to struggle a LOT to learn and find the things, how to do them, cuz natron is surely good, but beginner friendly? no. And then no wonder why people prefers other proprietary software,like after effects, cuz there are tutorials available for them. and all the subs of natron are dead.
 ​
 And this is where the r/linuxediting comes, i want to create a community where we can post tutorials, and your products/edits made in linux to set a example that you can do many things in linux too.
 so if you want to post, your editing/edits products, tutorials for video, image, audio editing in linux, feel free to post it on r/linuxediting.
 Thank you.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[你可能已经知道像 Bash 和 Zsh 这样的流行 Shell。让我们来探索一些有趣和独特的 Shell。


Shell 通过解释命令为 Linux 和类 Unix 系统提供了一个接口，充当用户与操作系统的核心工作之间的中介。

毫无疑问，Bash Shell 是最受欢迎的 Shell 之一，但有些用户喜欢其他 Shell，比如在 macOS 上的默认 Shell——ZSH。但是除了这些流行的 Shell 之外，还存在许多 Shell，具有不同的功能和用途。

在本文中，我们将介绍一些被积极维护并提供不同用户体验的不太常见的 Shell。

1、Fish Shell

谈到除了 Bash、Zsh 之外的 Shell，第一个想到的就是 Fish Shell。

Fish 是一个智能的、用户友好的命令行 Shell，主要适用于类 Unix 操作系统。



Fish Shell 的特点：


根据历史记录提供命令自动建议和补全。

支持 24 位真彩。

支持语法高亮，所有特性都可以开箱即用。


安装 Fish：

Fish 可在几乎所有 Linux 发行版的官方仓库中获得。在 Ubuntu 中，你可以通过以下命令来安装：

sudo apt install fish


Ubuntu 仓库中的版本有点旧。如果你想安装最新版本，可以使用该团队提供的官方 PPA。

sudo apt-add-repository ppa:fish-shell/release-3
sudo apt update
sudo apt install fish



Fish Shell


2、Nushell

Nushell（Nu）是一种新型的 Shell，可以在 Linux、macOS、Windows、BSD 等系统上使用。它的哲学和灵感…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[根据官方说明，Fedora 36 已经到了生命的尽头。你应该升级到 Fedora 37。


发布于 2022 年 5 月 10 日的 Fedora Linux 36，于 2023 年 5 月 16 日达到生命终点。这意味着在此日期之后，Fedora Linux 36 将不再有任何形式的更新，包括安全更新或安全公告。所有被推送到稳定版的 Fedora Linux 36 的更新也将被停止。

Fedora Linux 37，于 2022 年 11 月 15 日发布，将继续接收更新，直到 Fedora Linux 39 发布后大约一个月，即 2023 年 11 月 14 日左右。

我们鼓励 Fedora Linux 36 的用户尽快升级到 Fedora Linux 37，以确保他们继续接收安全更新和错误修复。要升级，你可以按照我下面的详细升级指南进行：


如何从 Fedora 36 工作站升级到 Fedora 37（GUI 和 CLI 方法）


另外，Fedora 38 是最新的版本，你可以尝试全新安装该版本。

Fedora 项目是一个社区支持的项目，开发和维护基于 Linux 内核的自由和开源的操作系统。Fedora 以其前沿的软件和对创新的承诺而闻名。

Fedora 项目每六个月发布一个新版本的 Fedora。每个新版本都是基于上一个版本，包括新功能、错误修复和安全更新。

对于那些想要一个前沿的、不断更新的操作系统的用户来说，Fedora 是一个受欢迎的选择。对于想参与开发自由和开源操作系统的用户来说，它也是一个不错的选择。

《道与逻各斯》冯川译本

一
张隆溪教授的《道与逻各斯：东西方文学阐释学》（以下简称《道与逻各斯》）一书是他的名作。此书英文版最早出版于1992年（Zhang Longxi, The Tao and the Logos- Literary Hermeneutics, East and West, Durham & London: Duke University Press, 1992），在六年后由四川人民出版社出版了中译本，2006年译本又在江苏教育出版社再版。译者冯川教授的译著颇多，涉及文学、心理学、神学、哲学等各个方面。作者和译者都是资深学者，著作本身又贵为考研参考书，读者自然会期待它呈现出的精彩内容。
然而，笔者的阅读经历却并不美妙。一个偶然的契机，笔者注意到，中译本标注出的里尔克（Rilke）《杜伊诺哀歌》（Duino Elegies）诗句德语原文（111-112页）似有错漏，具体而言，出现在“Engel und Puppe; dann ist endlich Schauspiel”一句，中译为“天使与木偶：最终是一场真正的游戏”。Schauspiel是德语词，意为“戏剧”，此处竟把Schauspiel翻译成了“游戏”（对应的德语是Spiel）。这样的错误缘何出现？购入原书并加以比对之后，笔者方才明白：对应原文是作者引用的英译本里尔克诗集，该句作“Angel and puppet: a real play, finally”。Play在英文中确有“戏剧”之意，Schauspiel翻译为英文的play是合宜的。那么，问题只可能出在英译中的环节，正是译者把英文play转译成汉语“游戏”，失却德语诗句原意。尽管无法断言译者不通德语，但这至少体现出他的疏忽大意。
既然已从词语的翻译“破窗”，索性给这个译本做一次全面检查吧！通过细读原本，笔者总结出…]]></summary>

 What did it even mean to have an 80386? Did you install it into a motherboard? You'd interact with a keyboard and a terminal right? And the terminal would be a display right? You weren't printing on paper at this point in computing?
 And without an OS, how would you connect the terminal and keyboard to the microprocessor? Were standards robust enough in hardware that you could simply plug things into other things, or did you need to take a visit to RadioShack and get a breadboard?
 And what about even getting Linux? If you didn't already have a computer, how would you hear about Linux? How would you download it? 
 I chose the year 1993 for being 30 years ago, but if 1991 would have been any different, I'd love to hear about that too! I'm really interested to hear about mobile Linux

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've seen all of the internet that if you want to set a custom resolution with xrandr using a NVIDIA GPU, for most people it won't let you and will give you an error which looks like this:
 X Error of failed request: BadMatch (invalid parameter attributes) Major opcode of failed request: 153 (RANDR). Minor opcode of failed request: 18 (RRAddOutputMode). Serial number of failed request: 29. Current serial number in output stream: 30
 After months of struggling to find a fix, a link caught my eyes (https://download.nvidia.com/XFree86/Linux-x86_64/396.51/README/xconfigoptions.html) and I've found that if you add this line:
 Option "UseEDID" "FALSE"
 to your xorg.conf file at the monitor section and then reboot, it will give you a bunch of new resolutions and the posibility to finally add your custom resolutions using xrandr without giving the error of the above.
 I hope this is useful for those folks who tried all of the fixes they could ever found on the internet, but didn't get any results, like me.

        <updated>2023-06-01T16:11:17.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[文档马拉松是为你的开源项目制作或改进文档的一个好方法。


你的开源项目的文档对你的客户至关重要。你的目标受众必须了解你的项目的目的和如何使用它，而文档是弥合这一差距的工具。一个项目很少有真正完成的时候，所以随着你项目的不断改进，资源的维护和更新同样重要。

但是，当你有大量的文档需要维护，但又缺乏资源来保持它的时效性时，会发生什么？答案很简单：举办一个 文档马拉松docathon！

什么是文档马拉松？

文档马拉松就像 黑客马拉松hackathon。黑客马拉松是工程师和社区领袖聚集在一起改进或添加新功能到一个现有的应用的活动。在一个文档马拉松中，同样的合作集中在改进文档上。

文档马拉松可以填补内容上的空白，重组大型文档集，修复失效的链接，或者只是纠正错别字。举办文档马拉松的目的是为了在相对短的时间内改进大量的文档。

一些产品文档的例子包括：


培训手册

用户手册

安装指南

故障排除指南

快速入门指南

API 文档

教程


在我的组织里，我们的文档团队举办了一次文档马拉松，成功地修改了 102 页的安装指南。这次文档马拉松使我们能够专注于项目的范围，即重新组织简化，删除重复的内容，并遵循客户旅程。举办文档马拉松给我的团队留下了深刻的印象，并提高了客户的成功率。

3 件你可以通过文档马拉松实现的事情

以下是我举办文档马拉松的三大理由：

1、减少积压

大多数文档必须随着它所支持的产品的发展而发展。随着产品的变化或更新，文档也必须如此。在某些情况下，文档团队与工程团队的发布周期一起发布新版本的文档。随着团队内优先级的改变和 GA 发布 的继续，文档团队面临着跟上新功能、错误修复和任务完成的挑战。被遗弃的变化成为积压的一部分，一种需要在以后完成的工作的积累。


提示： 在文档马拉松期间，参与者可以对积压的项目进行分流，并在列表中完成它们。非技术性的参与者可以从事与错别字、失效的链接和其他文本相关问题的修复工作。


2、改造大型指南

当你的文档团队意识到是时候修改指南的时候，它可能已经有好几章，好几百页了。一旦制定了内容计划，重组的复杂性就开始了。重组大量的文档并不适合胆小的人。


提示： 组建一个团队来领导文档马拉松，并为不同团队或部门的全组织参与提供奖励。根据工作范围和时间限制，你的团队可以在比你预期更短的时间内成功重组整个指南。


3、跨职能团队之间的合作

一个组织内的不同小组孤立地工作是很常见的。工程、产品、客户支持、营销和文档团队可能没有像他们应该的那样经常在项目上进行协作。

想象一下，举办一次活动，每个团队成员都可以利用他们的专业知识来改善产品文档。文档马拉松促进了主题专家（SME）的多样性、实时协作和沟通。它们还允许一个包容性的环境，居住在不同地理位置的人可以亲自或远程参与。你的文件会得到具有不同观点和专业的专家的关注，最大限度地减少孤立的孤岛、无意识的偏见和倦怠。


提示： 使跨职能的团队为了一个共同的事业走到一起。


文档马拉松

下一次，当你的团队有一个似乎无法克服的积压工作，或者被赋予重组一个巨大的文档项目的任务时，考虑举办一个文档马拉松。这很容易，而且它的生产力可能会让你吃惊。关于举办这样的活动的更多信息，请阅读 Tiffany Long 写的很棒的 举办黑客马拉松的 10 步指南。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[时隔半年，特斯拉首席执行官埃隆·马斯克（Elon Musk）重新获得了世界首富的头衔。截至周三美股收盘，特斯拉股价涨1.38%，报203.93美元，今年迄今的涨幅已达88.65%。得益于特斯拉股价暴涨，马斯克今年财富增长超过553亿美元。


与此同时，前世界首富Bernard Arnault旗下的奢侈品巨头路威酩轩集团（LVMH）股价周三在巴黎股市下跌2.6%。随着越来越多的迹象显示经济增长放缓，人们对奢侈品行业蓬勃发展的信心开始消退。自4月份以来，LVMH的股价已经下跌了约10%，Arnault的净资产一度在一天之内蒸发了110亿美元。


根据彭博亿万富翁指数（Bloomberg Billionaires Index），马斯克目前的净资产约为1923亿美元，而Arnault的净资产约为1866亿美元。


事实上，马斯克自从2021年9月超越亚马逊创始人贝索斯成为世界首富之后，之后在较长时间内一直占据福布斯富豪榜榜首的位置。


然而，去年由于利率上升抑制了投资者对高风险投资的兴趣，而投资者们担心马斯克在收购推特后过分“分心”也拖累了特斯拉股价，该股暴跌逾65%。


也正因为如此，马斯克去年损失惨重，并于12月份失去了全球首富这一头衔，由Arnault接过代替。


但自新年伊始，投资者对降息即将到来的信心日益增强，以及在全球范围内兴起的AI热潮，都令投资者感到振奋，科技股大获提振，华尔街分析师们也纷纷表示看好。


美国投行Wedbush分析师Dan Ives在一份报告中写道，“总体而言，特斯拉处于有利地位，生成式人工智能应用于其产品套件和商业模式，其将获益匪浅，盈利增长进一步加速。”


“华尔街女股神”木头姐此前更是放出豪言称，在对其特斯拉定价模型进行更新后，预计在基准情境下，特斯拉2027年的每股预期价值将达到2000美元，这相当于当天收盘价的约12倍。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ubuntu 将发布纯 Snap 版的不可变 Linux

近些年不可变操作系统的概念开始流行，这种操作系统不能被用户或应用程序直接修改，采用原子式更新，应用通过容器化与操作系统隔离。一些流行的不可变操作系统有 Chrome OS、Fedora Silverblue 等。Canonical 计划将下一个 Ubuntu LTS 分为两个版本，除了传统版本外，还将有一个不可变的桌面操作系统版本。它基于其用于物联网环境的 Ubuntu Core，并且全部采用 Snap 来封装桌面应用以提供不可变性和更新需求的之间的平衡。


消息来源：Ubuntu



老王点评：听起来不错，对于那些需要不可变系统的人来说值得关注。不过，Snap 有多少指责，Canonical 不知道吗？如果不解决好了就推这种纯 Snap 版本，我恐怕它会陷入败局。




数百万技嘉主板出厂时内置不安全的后门

安全研究人员发现，技嘉出售的主板固件含有一个隐藏的机制。每当计算机重启时，固件代码会启动一个更新程序，然后下载和执行另一个软件，以保持主板固件更新。但技嘉的更新机制没有正确验证就下载代码到用户计算机上，部分情况下甚至是通过 HTTP 而不是 HTTPS 下载的，这容易遭到中间人攻击。受到影响的技嘉主板多达 271 个型号，其数量数以百万计。技嘉已经表示它计划修复研究人员发现的问题。


消息来源：Wired



老王点评：即便发布了新修复的固件，但是绝大部分人都不会主动去更新固件，也就是说，这个漏洞带来的影响可能很久都难以消除。只能说，有些产品设计人员还处在“隐秘就是安全”的远古思维。




Brave 浏览器用户每天为其添加数以百万计的新网页

Brave 声称，其独立的 Brave 搜索引擎现在提供超过每年 80 亿次的查询，这使其成为自微软必应以来增长最快的搜索引擎。另外，Brave 浏览器用户可选加入的 “网络发现项目” 为其提供了动力，该项目每天向 Brave 搜索引擎添加数以百万计的新网页，使其保持更新。Brave 网络浏览器现在有超过 6000 万活跃用户。


消息来源：Thurrott



老王点评：这样看起来浏览器和搜索引擎真是天作之合啊，通过用户的浏览行为来为搜索引擎提供索引建议，要比网络爬虫漫无目的的爬取更有质量。]]></summary>

I feel like it is because of the following reasons :
 The Fragmentation
 Yes, yes, Android is not the most unified OS too. Android suffers from a very major update problem too (on third-party OEMs). But there is one way where Android fragmentation isn't too bad - App Compatibility.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[6 月 1 日，阿里云宣布通义大模型进展，聚焦音视频内容的 AI 新品“通义听悟”正式上线，成为国内首个开放公测的大模型应用产品。




通义听悟接入了通义千问大模型的理解与摘要能力，可成为用户工作学习中的得力 AI 助手，帮助随时随地高效完成对音视频内容的转写、检索、摘要和整理，比如用大模型自动做笔记、整理访谈、提取 PPT 等。公测期间，用户可领取 100 小时以上听悟免费转写时长。

“换一种方式，让音视频可以被轻松阅读、整理和分享。”阿里云 CTO 周靖人介绍，听悟是一款工作学习 AI 助手，它瞄准具有高知识附加值的音视频内容场景，比如开会、上课、访谈、培训、面试、直播、看视频、听播客等，能通过大模型等最新 AI 技术快速提炼和沉淀知识。 



根据现场演示，听悟融合了十多项 AI 功能，可以全面提升知识从音视频向图文形态转化的效率。除了“听力好”，能高准确度生成会议记录、区分不同发言人，这个 AI 助手“悟性也极高”，大模型可以一秒给音视频划分章节并形成摘要、总结全文及每个发言人观点、整理关注重点和待办事项。大模型一键提取 PPT、针对多个音视频内容向 AI 提问、概括特定段落等功能近期也将上线。



通义听悟可自动为音视频生成全文摘要、章节概括、发言总结

针对一些细分场景，听悟还设置了不少“宝藏功能”：打开 Chrome 插件，外语学习者和听障人士可以借助双语悬浮字幕条随时随地看无字幕视频，日程冲突时，听悟还可成为职场人士的“开会替身”，在静音情况下入会 AI 可代为记录会议、整理要点；转写结果可下载为字幕文件，方便新媒体从业者视频后期制作；听悟梳理的问答回顾可以让记者、分析师、律师、HR 等群体整理访谈更高效。



通义听悟 Chrome 插件将在近期对所有用户开放下载

另一显著优势是，听悟与阿里云盘打通，一键就能转写云盘上的音视频内容，公测期间注册的听悟用户后续还将获得更大的阿里云盘存储空间，在云盘内在线播放视频时也可自动出字幕。



通义听悟支持一键导入阿里云盘音视频文件

周靖人介绍，听悟集成了阿里最先进的语音和语言技术。其内置阿里新一代工业级语音识别模型，识别准确率在多个权威中文数据集上名列第一；融合自研语音语义多模态说话人算法，能对 10 人以上说话场景进行角色区分；接入通义千问大模型后，能够对上万字的音视频内容进行摘要总结，事实准确与要点完备性国内领先，支持跨多音视频内容的精准问答理解。

继史无前例的大降价后，阿里云再次送出人人都能用上的 AI “大礼包”。此前国内语音厂商 AI 转写定价达 19.8 元每小时，而听悟用户可通过每日登陆等多种任务领取免费转写时长。公测期间，阿里云官方微博、微信及各大平台社区还会发放大量 20 小时转写口令码，用户获得的福利权益可累加，一年内有效，免费时长可高达 100 小时以上，市场价值上千元。

古典考古学者尼夏·马克·斯维尼（Naoíse Mac Sweeney）在她的新书《西方：旧观念的新历史》（The West: A New History of an Old Idea）中，通过对十四位历史人物的生涯及其著作的记述，挑战并再阐释了“西方文明”这个已经存在了两千五百年的概念。这十四人从公元前五世纪伟大的希腊历史学家希罗多德开始，到二十一世纪的前香港特首林郑月娥，她是香港最近“由乱至治”进程中的主导人物。
听到这个你会觉得有趣吗？坦率地说，我很怀疑。我们都知道出版商喜欢这种铺张的场景，但很容易想象，这本书可能会变成二手知识和温吞水陈词滥调的混合体。
雪上加霜的是，她的前提几乎没有原创性，马克·斯维尼也直接承认了这一点。在人们的理解中，西方文明的历史，从柏拉图到北约，是卓越思想和实践的一种结合（自由！民主！言论自由！），源于古希腊，此后被提炼、延伸，并随着时代的发展（经历了文艺复兴、科学革命和其他据称西方独有的发展阶段）而传播，所以我们今天所在的西方是某种卓越文化DNA的幸运继承者。
这种提法非常有力，因此毫不奇怪，它在美国总是特别受欢迎——因为与种族灭绝、种族清洗、大规模种族奴役和生态破坏相比，这种将你的国族历史联系起来的叙述更令人振奋。但在学术界，“西方文明”已不再是一个被认真对待的概念。相反，现在有大量的文献在解构“西方”这个概念是如何在不同的时间和地点被发明、引导并使用的——往往是以我们自己会觉得非常令人厌恶的方式。
在这本书中，麦克·斯维尼向普通读者解释这一切为何如此——以及这种立论为何会如此发生。她一定是一位了不起的教师，同时也是富有才华的作家，因为这项颇具挑战性的任务被漂…]]></summary>

到了人工智能的文本与图像生成能力眼看就要攻陷知识人最后坚守的信念堡垒的今天，恐怕已经没有多少人会对历史叙事的生成背后的所谓客观性深信不疑了，“历史由胜利者书写”以及被遮蔽的“沉默的历史”等论述也早已成了老生常谈。然而关于“历史”究竟是如何被权力生产出来的疑问远未解决，虽然权力与历史书写的关系也早已被谈论，近日在网上流传罗新教授关于“政治强权对历史论述的独占”的精彩论述（节选自他的著作《有所不为的反叛者》）也引起了反响，但是对于“独占”过程中的手段、性质及复杂的细节等问题仍然有必要展开深入的讨论。更不用说当人们越来越意识到必须把世界发展的未来与过去及现在联系起来思考的时候，显然更需要把“历史”这个文本的权力生产真相认识清楚。历史学家帕特里克·格里（Patrick J. Geary）指出，作为民族主义意识形态工具的现代史学“将我们对过去的理解变成了一个有毒的垃圾场，里面充满了族群民族主义的毒气，而且，这种毒气已经渗透进大众的意识中”（帕特里克·格里《民族的神话——欧洲的中世纪起源》，吕昭等译，广西师大出版社，2022年，第1页）。我们无论如何不应低估这种充满毒性的、固化的历史认知对开创未来生活的严重阻碍。格里还曾经在一次研讨会上说：“所有的历史学问题都不是清白无辜的，他们都有自己的分子生物学传承谱系。”历史学问题的“清白无辜”与否，主要指的就是历史生产的真实语境的复杂性和利益动机，而所谓“分子生物学传承谱系”实际上指的是权力的传承谱系。
在这个意义上，美国人类学家米歇尔-罗尔夫·特鲁约（Michel-Rolph Trouillot，1949-2012）的《沉默的过去：权力与历史生产》（原书名Silencing the Past：Power and th…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[以下是如何使用 OpenAI ChatGPT AI 创建聊天助手的 Python 程序的方法。


易于使用的 AI “ChatGPT” 已经以 API 提供。ChatGPT 的创造者 OpenAI 宣布，模型（'gpt-3.5-turbo'）现在适用于自定义产品和解决方案。而且成本也非常实惠。目前的价格为每 1000 个令牌 0.002 美元。

该模型目前与 Whisper API 一起提供，后者也用于文本到语音解决方案。该 API 目前具备以下功能：


创建自定义的对话代理和机器人

为你编写 Python 代码

起草电子邮件或任何你想要的文档

你可以将自然语言界面集成到你当前的产品/应用/服务或软件中，为你的消费者提供服务

语言翻译服务

成为许多科目的导师

模拟视频游戏角色


正如你所见，机会无限。

如果你计划尝试该 API 并开始使用它，这里有一个简单的指南，为你提供逐步指导。

OpenAI ChatGPT API: 入门指南

先决条件

确保你拥有一个 OpenAI 账户。如果你没有，访问此页面 并创建一个账户。你也可以使用你的谷歌或微软账号。

创建一个账户后，生成一个专属于你的 API 密钥。访问 此页面 并创建一个新的秘密密钥。



记录该密钥或在安全的地方保存它。基于安全原因，它将不会从 OpenAI 账户部分再次可见。而且不要与任何人分享此密钥。如果你计划使用企业解决方案，请向你的组织查询 API 密钥。由于该密钥与你的付费 OpenAI 计划相关，因此请谨慎使用。

设置环境

安装 Python 和 pip

本指南使用 Python 编程语言来调用 OpenAI API 密钥。你可以使用 Java 或其他任何语言来调用它。

首先，请确保你在 Linux 或 Windows 中…]]></summary>

Been looking through those and it seems to require skill with apt and rpm based distros but so far the books haven't narrowed it down much beyond that. I've been using Linux for nearly 20 years as an end user but haven't done a lot of admin work. Just some simple jobs here and there. The goal is to cash in on all that experience I picked up and get off of disability. I've chosen LPIC-1 as a first stop in a series of certification I want to get. Any pointers at all for studying would be greatly appreciated.

Out of the box experience:
  
 I like their customized GNOME. It's fresh, it's not a copy of Windows layout, but it's also more intuitive than vanilla for new users coming from Windows. E.g. - a lot of users are used to system tray and functionality which is not in stock GNOME. They also added accent colors.
 Unlike Fedora and OpenSUSE, it doesn't need bunch of commands for codecs and hardware acceleration. Recently, on Fedora there was some conflicts with mesa-freeword which resulted in borked systems. …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[用开放的决策进行设计可以帮助增加用户体验和开发团队之间的合作。


理想情况下，设计师与他们的产品团队和用户有良好的关系。然而，设计师和开发者之间的关系更难建立和维持。缺乏密切的关系使得问题的解决或改进变得困难。

根据我的经验，开源的 开放决策框架Open Decision Framework 可以克服许多这样的障碍。

开放决策框架宣称，开放式决策 是透明的、包容的、以客户为中心的。它包括与受影响的各方清楚地分享问题、要求和限制。它能够与多个利益相关者合作，以确保不同的意见和全面的反馈。最重要的是，它能在相互竞争的需求和优先事项之间管理关系和期望。

这些原则可能会引起任何参与设计产品、功能或服务的决策的人的共鸣。对于一个设计师来说，开发人员是做出最佳设计决策的关键利益相关者。如果你是一个设计师，现在是时候接受获得不同意见的机会了。

后台和用户体验

开发人员是关键的利益相关者，因为用户的产品或服务体验不仅仅是屏幕上的像素或工作流程的设计。它包含了服务的性能、API 调用的速度、处理用户数据的方式，甚至是数据的可扩展性设计。当他们被认为是设计中的完全利益相关者时，开发者可以贡献他们在服务的后端和架构方面的专业知识，以协助整体的体验设计。

用户体验（UX）设计师是开发团队所负责的项目的利益相关者。性能上的不足，或者架构对可用数据的影响，都会阻碍用户体验。一个开放的、开发和设计之间的合作关系 允许在所有领域的信任和透明。

为合作留出空间

开发者和设计之间的开放和透明的关系并不像它应该的那样普遍。这种工作方式对双方来说可能都是新的。以下是我为使合作成功而提出的五大建议：


建立一个经常性的合作时间：为设计和开发建立一个经常性的时间，在每周到每月一次之间进行会面。邀请的对象至少应该包括 UX、主导工程和质量工程。理想情况下，如果日程安排允许，团队中的所有开发人员都应该被邀请参加。

使分享成为主要议程： UX 应该分享他们目前正在进行的用例和功能，以及任何相关的用户研究数据。UX 设计师应该向开发团队展示工作流程设计、线框图和高保真模拟图。开发应该分享他们这边做出的任何可能影响用户体验的设计决定。

鼓励提问： 合作是最理想的情况。鼓励所有与会者提出问题并给予反馈。对问题的回答和对反馈的回应是讨论设计和方向的机会，也是一个相互学习的机会。

拥抱学习的心态：避免说教或“告诉”。相反，目的是互相学习。利用彼此的专业知识，为用户和客户设计和建立一个良好的体验。要求对不熟悉的技术或概念进行解释。

考虑正式学习：当群体说着相同的语言时，合作关系会更容易。考虑正式的学习途径，例如：

设计人员：编码基础课程，如开源的 Odin 项目，对于学习服务的构造和构建的基本原理是有帮助的。

开发人员：对 UX 原则的理解可以帮助指导问题和反馈。你可以在 UX 设计原则或各种书籍和文章中找到一个很好的概述。




一个开放合作的例子

在与我团队中的一个开发人员进行的早期设计审查中，我展示了一个具体的交互，以显示关于一个物体的更多数据。我传达了用户的需求并演示了这个交互，这时开发者问道：“是否需要完全以这种方式来完成？”

他提到，只要在设计上稍加改动，开发的工作量就会大大降低。我们同意，这些改变不会对用户体验产生负面影响，而且用户仍然能够实现他们的目标。

这种反馈节省了开发团队的时间，留下了更多的机会来解决错误，建立额外的功能，并保持健康的工作和生活的平衡。用户体验依然强劲，而团队则更加强大。如果没有一个与我有深厚工作关系的开发者的早期反馈，这个结果是不可能的。

你的下一步

建立体验是由一个合作的团队做出的一系列决定。产品、设计和开发需要作为各自领域的专家和其他人的利益相关者一起工作。我鼓励你让开发和设计参与进来，以获得更多的合作反馈，并一起努力创造出具有最佳用户体验的最佳产品。

 Unfortunately there's some extremely long-standing (nine years now?) bug with these specific speakers that leaves me with no sound on every distro I've tried (Arch, Endeavor, Manjaro, Mint, Pop). I'm just left with "dummy output". The worst part is, a) it always works fine in the live environment, and there were several times on Endeavor where I'd turn it off and back on and the audio would suddenly work, so it feels like there's some obvious answer just slightly out of my grasp, but I can't figure it out, and now I have this laptop I don't really need that I can't use in the way I want and it sssssuuuuucccckkkkssss.
 Doubly unfortunately it's the only one at its price point with as nice a hardware feature set as this, so if I return it for a more Linux compatible one I'll be shelling out another $300 or so just to match this.
 God damn you, Windows. You've won yet again 🤬

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[据北京市市场监督管理局消息，日前，苹果电子产品商贸(北京)有限公司因发布虚假广告被北京市东城区市场监督管理局处以20万元的行政处罚。


处罚信息显示，2022年2月14日，执法人员依据举报线索浏览当事人上述网站，发现其通过上述网站为其销售的Macbook Air产品广告使用了“8核中央处理器、干活够爽快，用电省得狠。”“M1芯片拥有我们迄今打造的最快的中央处理器。”等内容，并在页面右上角有“广告”字样。


经调查，上述页面为当事人为所售的MacbookAir笔记本发布的商业广告。MacbookAir笔记本搭载的M1芯片配备8核中央处理器，包括四个高性能核心和四个高效能核心。2021年10月，苹果公司推出了配备M1Pro和M1Max芯片的MacBookPro。M1Pro和M1Max芯片搭载的是由8颗高性能核心和2颗高效率核心组成的全新10核中央处理器，运行速度相比M1提升最高可达70%。


综上，案发时M1芯片配备的中央处理器并非为苹果公司打造的最快的。你单位在配备M1芯片的MacbookAir和配备M1Pro和M1Max芯片的MacBookPro同时销售的情况下，在MacbookAir产品广告中宣称其搭载的M1芯片“拥有我们迄今打造的最快的中央处理器。”内容与事实不符。上述广告内容由当事人自行编辑制作及上传发布，广告费用无法核算。


依据《中华人民共和国广告法》(2018)第五十五条第一款，北京市东城区市场监督管理局责令当事人改正上述违法行为，停止发布上述广告，在相应范围内消除影响，并处罚款20万元。

I thought about Ubuntu, as it seems to be enterprise orienting Linux desktop ecosystem. I use Arch BTW, and I would love to stick with it. So any low-effort distro-less MDM solution would be great.
 Or any tips for how do you manage Linux computers at your corporate environment.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Official Wikipedia Page states that usage of Linux computers as of April, 2022 was only 2.48%. But we know that these figures can't be realistic, right? There are many reasons for this:
  
Linux is a privacy friendly OS and the defaults in most distros won't allow any telemetry or data collection unless explicitly approved - and let's face it, most people won't explicitly approve it because otherwise they wouldn't be using Linux in the first place! Privacy and Freedom are like numero uno reason why people use Linux.
 How did they track this 2.48% figure? I'm guessing they took it from download stats of popular distros like Ubuntu, Mint, Debian, etc. or did they source it from Distrowatch or something? These are all still very conservative estimates because the way Linux community is spread so wide and distributed that it's difficult to track all installs. For example, many Universities and NGOs across the world act as mirrors for hosting Linux ISOs and students studying in those Universities might be directly sourcing the ISOs from there instead of going to the Ubuntu or Debian home page? There is also the case that many Linux enthusiasts source the distros through torrenting and those won't be counted.
  
In fact, the same wikipedia page then quotes a StackOverflow survey where developers are explicitly asked which OS they use. Even this share is still smaller than windows but to me, this seems like a more reasonable estimate of Linux's true market share:
  
Windows: 45.3%
 macOS: 29.2%
 Linux: 25.3%
 BSD/Unix: 0.1%
  
If possible, I want you to do a quick anecdotal exercise. Try to count on your fingers the number of your own friends and acquaintances who use Windows and Linux and then compute their share. I have a feeling that figure will match closely to the StackOverflow survey results above!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Rust 项目再次陷入领导力危机

继两年前 Rust 审核团队宣布立即辞职后，Rust 项目的管理就一直处于跛脚运行之中。最近，Rust 项目又卷入了 RustConf 主题演讲争议。RustConf 2023 主动邀请了 JeanHeyd Meneide 发表主题演讲，他是 C 语言官方标准的两位编辑之一，管理着许多重要的大型开源项目。但在他花费了大量时间准备了演讲《编译时编程（可能）的未来》后，Rustconf 以其演讲“不被 Rust 项目认可”，担心该演讲被认为是官方方向的理由，而通知他将主题演讲降为普通演讲。但实际原因被推测为他曾经分享过一些认为 Rust 应该反思的内容，Rust 管理层内有人反感他。他认为这是一次侮辱，随即 宣布 拒绝出席 RustConf。此事还导致推荐他发表演讲的 Rust 核心成员愤而辞职。在此事冲上热搜后，Rust 项目发表 声明 对此事公开道歉，称它的决策和沟通流程出现了问题，开始启动两年来迟迟未决的新的治理委员会。


消息来源：The PHD



老王点评：一个成功的开源项目，需要广泛的社区决策，也需要一个定海神针般的领袖人物，Linux 如此、Python 如此。而 Rust 社区却没有一个灵魂人物，我们只能看到各种内部斗争和自行其是，这样的风格，即便成立治理委员会，我认为也很难说有未来。

ChatGPT 为律师编写的法庭文件杜撰了六个不存在的案例

尽管我们知道人工智能会煞有介事的杜撰一些“事实”，但是一位律师在使用 ChatGPT 帮助编写法庭文件时，AI 居然杜撰了六个不存在的案例，并且还信誓旦旦地给出了法律来源，保证了其可靠性。律师表示，没有确认 ChatGPT 提供的来源是他的错。法官称这是“前所未有的”，并考虑对该律师进行惩罚。


消息来源：Ars Technica



老王点评：在 AI 出错时，你对它提出的批评它往往会听从。但如果你指出它的“事实性”错误时，它往往是嘴硬的，所以你还是得依靠“古典的”搜索引擎来确认事实。]]></summary>

2020年11月16日凌晨，在日本东京涩谷附近的公交车站，一位名叫大林三佐子的六十四岁女性被人打死。真相很快查明：这位女性是一名无家可归者，以打短工为生，去世时口袋里只有八日元——这或许便是她只能在公交车站过夜的原因。而凶手吉田和人是住在附近的一名独居中年男子，靠出租父母留下来的房屋过活。他对自己居住区域周边的“卫生”极为偏执，经常因住所附近的垃圾杂物问题与邻人起争执，而大林三佐子当晚栖身的公交车站恰好在他家窗户的视线范围之内。于是在那个深秋的夜晚，吉田和人意欲驱赶大林三佐子，后者不从——结果惨剧发生。
这一事件很快引起人们关注。拜现代新闻业与传媒技术所赐，很快有记者挖掘出死者生平信息，而旁观者们也纷纷通过各种渠道了解到这个女人平凡但不断下落的人生，以及她年轻时的照片——自然，这样直接的图像信息很容易带来共情冲击，“她就是我”的评论很快出现在各类社交平台之上。日本广播协会（NHK）很快制作了讲述大林三佐子青春时代的纪录片，随后导演高桥伴明基于这一事件拍摄了电影《在公交车站直到黎明》，令这一事件受到新一轮关注。
大林三佐子无疑是不幸的，但比起历史上太多无名的不幸者，她又多少有一丝幸运——至少，她的故事没有彻底隐入尘烟，更没有因为记录的缺位而沦为传说的背景。然而1888年在伦敦白教堂附近接连横尸街头的五名女子则没有这样的“幸运”——尽管官方记录中有她们的名字，但对于大多数人而言，她们只是连环杀手“开膛手杰克”的陪衬，是五个微不足道的“妓女”。
英国历史学家海莉·鲁本霍德的《生而为女》（原作名“The Five”，下文未标注书名之引用皆出自中译本）正是为填补这一空白而写。“我之所以提起笔，是希望如今的我们现在可以听清她们的故事，并将那些一度从她们生命中被残酷夺走的…]]></summary>

 To be exact, he said:
  
An immutable version exists since 2015, called UbuntuCore... there will be a desktop release of it with the next LTS (optional though, the classic desktop install will indeed not go away)
  
This seems to be the repo Canonical is using to test this (ignore the commit bumping up the image size to 12GB)

夏孙桐官至杭州知府，但1938年他对自己的定位是“也署先朝旧史官”（《自题花之寺看海棠图》，《观所尚斋诗存》卷二，民国二十八年铅印本）。追溯起来，他在翰林院编修任上时，就与修国史会典。清室逊政后，他参与编纂了《清史稿》及徐世昌主编的《大清畿辅先哲传》《晚晴簃诗汇》《清儒学案》，还参与了《续修四库全书总目提要》的撰写。像他这样同时参与了五种大工程的，并不多见，显示了他在传统目录学、史学上的造诣与名声。他在诸老间颇有资望，曾为缪荃孙、叶昌炽、陈曾寿、冯幵、郭则沄、关赓麟、赵椿年、张仲炘、汪曾武、黄公渚等人的编著题耑（详见夏武康、夏志兰整理《闰庵公遗墨辑录》，2004年自印本，17-38页）。1938年秋，傅增湘藏园举行“蓬山话旧”第五集（前清进士雅集）时，他是最年长的一位。基本上，他目睹了中法战争以来的所有军国大事，尽管从未置身于事件的中心。最接近的一次要数庚子事变，1900年秋冬，他奔赴西安“行在”，然而也远离事变的中心北京。他作为清遗民或清遗臣，处在类似的行列。他从未出任、也未谋求过民国政府的官职（供职清史馆应当作…]]></summary>

2023 Linux Storage, Filesystem,
Memory-Management and BPF Summit on work they have been doing to
implement atomic block writes of various sizes for SCSI and NVMe. 
The idea is to support devices that can guarantee atomic operations for
sizes larger than their block size.
 It is
an attempt to "find 
common ground" between the two standards, Petersen said, because the two
have slightly different semantics, depending on the device type, and
different restrictions, which has made for an "interesting project". It has
been a challenge to find an abstraction layer that can work with the "five
different variants 
of SCSI and NVMe implementations that may or may not be out there".]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[5月30日消息，350位AI行业的高管、研究人员和工程师日前签署了一封公开信，表示担忧AI技术将对人类带来生存威胁。这封信由位于非营利组织人工智能安全中心发布，其中仅有一句话：“降低人工智能带来的灭绝风险应该成为一个全球优先事项，与大流行病、核战争等其他社会规模的风险并列。”


OpenAI首席执行官Sam Altman、Google DeepMind首席执行官Demis Hassabis、Anthropic首席执行官Dario Amodei三位 AI公司高管，以及2018年图灵奖得主Geoffrey Hinton、Yoshua Bengio已签署这封信。


自ChatGPT掀起AI热潮以来，对这项技术潜在风险的担忧持续增加。此次公开信引发了广泛关注和热议，也使得人们对 AI技术的发展和应用有了更加深入的思考与探讨。


这份声明由总部位于旧金山的非营利组织人工智能安全中心发布，他们认为AI对人类构成生存威胁，所以发出了新的警告。整份声明仅有一句话，全部内容如下：



“降低人工智能带来的灭绝风险应该成为一个全球优先事项，与大流行病、核战争等其他社会规模的风险并列。” 






此前，马斯克联合超过千名产业界和学术界的大佬们，在“生命未来研究所（Future of Life Institute）”网站上发布联名公告。公开信中主要传达了两个方面的信息：一是警告人工智能存在对人类社会的潜在威胁，要求立刻暂停任何比GPT-4更强大的人工智能系统的训练，时间跨度至少6个月。二是呼吁整个人工智能领域以及政策制定者们，要共同设计一套全面的人工智能治理系统，对人工智能技术的发展进行监督和审查。]]></summary>

非营利组织“人工智能安全中心Center for AI Safety”预计将发布一份只有一句话的声明：“减轻人工智能带来的灭绝风险应与其他社会规模的风险，如大流行病和核战争一样，成为全球优先事项。”这封公开信由 350 多名从事人工智能工作的高管、研究人员和工程师签署，签署者包括三家领先的人工智能公司 OpenAI、谷歌 DeepMind 和Anthropic 的 CEO，也包括除了 Yann LeCun 之外的人工智能领域另外两位图灵奖得主。

老王点评：这个时候，我们应该相信他们真的放出来一只不得了的巨兽。但是我觉得，倡议是徒劳的，或许能引起全社会的关注，但是如果没有切实的利益机制制约，早晚会无可遏制。




人工智能意味着每个人现在都可以成为程序员

在台北举行的 Computex 论坛上，英伟达 CEO 黄仁勋对数千人说，人工智能正在引领一场计算革命。他在演讲中说：“毫无疑问，我们正处于一个新的计算时代”。他表示，人工智能意味着每个人现在都可以成为计算机程序员，因为他们需要做的只是与计算机对话，并为 “数字鸿沟” 的结束欢呼。

老王点评：程序员可能就会像以前的手工业者们一样，绝大部分都会消失，只在偏僻的角度零星留下几个来修复一些遗留系统。




英特尔将在其最新 CPU 中加入人工智能处理芯片

英特尔称，将在其即将推出的第 14 代酷睿处理器 Meteor Lake CPU 的所有型号中加入 “视觉处理单元” VPU。如今，CPU 和 GPU 承担着繁重的工作，但它们将被人工智能工作负载的需求所淹没。将这些工作转移到云端是昂贵的，也是不切实际的，因为买家希望个人电脑有良好的性能，因此，VPU 将作为一种 SoC 出现在 CPU 中。CPU 仍将被要求做低延迟的简单推理工作，GPU 将被用来做涉及并行和吞吐量的工作，而其他与人工智能相关的工作将被卸载到 VPU 上。

老王点评：整个世界仍像一辆没有刹车的卡车，奔向了人工智能的未来。

夏孙桐

夏孙桐官至杭州知府，但1938年他对自己的定位是“也署先朝旧史官”（《自题花之寺看海棠图》，《观所尚斋诗存》卷二，民国二十八年铅印本）。追溯起来，他在翰林院编修任上时，就与修国史会典。清室逊政后，他参与编纂了《清史稿》及徐世昌主编的《大清畿辅先哲传》《晚晴簃诗汇》《清儒学案》，还参与了《续修四库全书总目提要》的撰写。像他这样同时参与了五种大工程的，并不多见，显示了他在传统目录学、史学上的造诣与名声。他在诸老间颇有资望，曾为缪荃孙、叶昌炽、陈曾寿、冯幵、郭则沄、关赓麟、赵椿年、张仲炘、汪曾武、黄公渚等人的编著题耑（详见夏武康、夏志兰整理《闰庵公遗墨辑录》，2004年自印本，17-38页）。1938年秋，傅增湘藏园举行“蓬山话旧”第五集（前清进士雅集）时，他是最年长的一位。基本上，他目睹了中法战争以来的所有军国大事，尽管从未置身于事件的中心。最接近的一次要数庚子事变，1900年秋冬，他奔赴西安“行在”，然而也远离事变的中心北京。他作为清遗民或清遗臣，处在类似的行列。他从未出任、也未谋求过民国政府的官职（供职清史馆应当作…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[我正在制作一份有关计算机以二进制表示事物的小册子，有人问我一个问题 - 为什么 x86 架构使用 8 位字节？为什么不能是其他大小呢？

对于类似这样的问题，我认为有两种可能性：


这是历史原因造成的，其他尺寸（如 4、6 或 16 位）同样有效。

8 位是客观上的最佳选择，即使历史发展不同，我们仍然会使用 8 位字节。

一些混合 1 和 2 的因素。


我对计算机历史并不是非常着迷（与阅读计算机文献相比，我更喜欢使用计算机），但我总是很好奇计算机事物今天的方式是否存在本质原因，或者它们大多是历史偶然的结果。因此，我们将谈论一些计算机历史。

作为历史偶然性的一个例子：DNS 有一个 class 字段，它有 5 种可能的值（internet、chaos、hesiod、none 和 any）。 对我来说，这是一个明显的历史意外的例子 - 如果我们今天重新设计 DNS 而不必担心向后兼容性，我无法想象我们会以相同的方式定义类字段。我不确定我们是否会使用 class 字段！

这篇文章没有明确的答案，但我在 Mastodon 上提问，并找到了一些潜在的 8 位字节原因。我认为答案是这些原因的某种组合。

字节和字有什么区别？

首先，本文中经常提到 “字节byte” 和 “字word”。它们有什么区别？我的理解是：


字节的大小 是你可以寻址的最小单元。例如，在我的计算机上，程序中的 0x20aa87c68 可能是一个字节的地址，然后 0x20aa87c69 是下一个字节的地址。

字的大小 是字节大小的某个倍数。我对此困惑了多年，维基百科的定义非常模糊（“字是特定处理器设计使用的自然数据单元”）。我最初认为字大小与寄存器大小相同（在 x86-64 上为 64 位）。但是根据 英特尔架构手册 的第 4.1 节（“基本数据类型”），在 x86 …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[完善你的电商应用，使它能够正确处理业务规则。


在前面的文章中，我已经解释了为什么将编程问题看作一整群丧尸来处理是错误的。我用 ZOMBIES 方法来解释为什么循序渐进地处理问题更好。

ZOMBIES 表示以下首字母缩写：


Z – 最简场景（Zero）

O – 单元素场景（One）

M – 多元素场景（Many or more complex）

B – 边界行为（Boundary behaviors）

I – 接口定义（Interface definition）

E – 处理特殊行为（Exercise exceptional behavior）

S – 简单场景用简单的解决方案（Simple scenarios, simple solutions）


在系列的前三篇文章中，我展示了 ZOMBIES 方法的前五项。第一篇中 实现了最简场景，它为代码提供了最简可行路径。第二篇文章中执行了 单元素场景和多元素场景上的测试。第三篇中介绍了 边界和接口。在本文中，我将带你了解倒数第二个方法：处理特殊行为。

处理特殊行为

在开发一个电子购物应用时，你需要从产品负责人或赞助商那里了解需要采用什么销售策略。

毫无疑问，与任何电子商业活动一样，你需要通过制定销售策略来诱导顾客进行消费。假设有如下的销售策略：订单金额超过 ￥500 时可以享受一定的折扣优惠。

现在将这个销售策略转换为可运行期望：

[Fact]
public void Add2ItemsTotal600GrandTotal540() {
        var expectedGrandTotal = 540.00;
        var actualGrandTotal = 0.00;

丧尸没有边界感。它们踩倒栅栏，推倒围墙，进入不属于它们的地盘。在前面的文章中，我已经解释了为什么把所有编程问题当作一群丧尸一次性处理是错误的。

ZOMBIES 代表首字母缩写：


Z – 最简场景（Zero）

O – 单个元素场景（One）

M – 多个元素场景（Many or more complex）

B – 边界行为（Boundary behaviors）

I – 接口定义（Interface definition）

E – 处理特殊行为（Exercise exceptional behavior）

回到单元素场景

要想处理边界，你需要绕回来（迭代）。

首先思考下面的问题：电子商务的边界是什么？我需要限制购物框的大小吗？（事实上，我不认为这有任何意义。）

目前唯一合理的边界条件是确保购物框里的商品数量不能为负数。将这个限制表示成可运行的期望：

        <link href="https://linux.cn/article-15858-1.html?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss"/>
        <updated>2023-05-30T01:03:05.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[在遇到合并冲突时，请不要惊慌。通过一些娴熟的技巧协商，你可以解决任何冲突。


假设你和我正在共同编辑同一个名称为 index.html 的文件。我对文件进行了修改，进行了提交，并将更改推送到 Git 远程仓库。你也对同一个文件进行了修改，进行了提交，并开始将更改推送到同一个 Git 仓库。然而，Git 检测到一个冲突，因为你所做的更改与我所做的更改冲突。

以下是你可以解决冲突的方法：

1、从远程仓库获取并合并最新更改：

$ git pull


2、识别一个或多个有冲突的文件：

$ git status


3、使用文本编辑器打开冲突文件：

$ vim index.html


4、解决冲突。冲突的修改会被标记为 <<<<<<< HEAD 和 >>>>>>>。你需要选择要保留和放弃哪些修改，并手动编辑文件以合并冲突的修改。

以下是一个示例：

<<<<<<< HEAD
<div class="header">
<h1>Sample text 1</h1>
</div>
=======
<div class="header">
<h1>Sample text 2</h1>
</div>
>>>>>>> feature-branch


在这个例子中，我将网站标题更改为 Sample text 1，而你将标题更改为 Sample text 2。两种更改都已添加到文件中。现在你可以决定保留哪一个标题，或者编辑文件以合并更改。在任一情况下，删除指示更改开始和结束的标记，只留下你想要的代码：

<div class="header">
<h1>Sample text 2</h1>
</div>


5、保存所有更改，并关闭编辑器。

6、将文件添加到暂存区：

$ git add index.html


7、提交更改：

$ git commit -m "Updated h1 in index.html"


此命令使用消息 Resolved merge conflict 提交更改。

8、将更改推送到远程仓库：

$ git push


结论

合并冲突是将注意力集中于代码的好理由。你在文件中进行的更改越多，就越容易产生冲突。你应该进行更多的提交，每个提交更改应该更少。你应该避免进行包含多个特性增强或错误修复的单片巨大更改。你的项目经理也会感谢你，因为具有清晰意图的提交更容易追踪。在最初遇到 Git 合并冲突时可能会感到吓人，但是现在你知道如何解决它，你会发现它很容易解决。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I recently decided to give Enlightenment a try, and it's absolutely fantastic.
 Thanks to everyone involved in making it awesome. 
 Things I liked: 
  
Crazy good performance
  
Smooth window animations even if the system is overloaded
 
Instantly opening, organized menus on an HDD
 
Tiny memory footprint
 
 Some unique default design decisions
  
Focus change on mouseover
 
Focus change not moving windows to the top
 
 
The window bar combining fast access with sufficient information to decide which entry is which window, keeping sorting.
 
Insanely configurable
  
The Key binding system is totally insane. The amount of Actions, the possibility to set contexts… I love it
 
Window settings almost on par with KDE
 
 Working and fast crash recovery
  
Problems I run into: 
  
Some semi-reproducable crashes (e.g. being in fullscreen with the mouse in a corner sometimes causes crashes)
 Selections often do not jump to the correct position. E.g. Selecting a keybinding does not jump to the assigned action reliably. Same with run with dialogue and search.
 
Some Application-choice menus are borderline unusable, because they list everything without a tree structure and the search is not sufficiently well-designed to make up for that. 
 Many little bugs (default application selection gui does not properly reset, Task bar sometimes "stuck"…)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I created a small 2D game engine named  Tiny.
The engine was created using Kotlin Multiplatform and can run on a JVM and JS.
Funny things: Games can be created using the programming language Lua.
Tiny is designed to help you create and test your ideas quickly and effectively. Not only can you run your games on your desktop computer, but you can also export them for the web, making it easy to share your creations with others.
You can create games easily with the hot reload, small API and Lua, which is very easy to learn.
If you want to test a game idea, to try to create your first game or just have fun, give it a try to  Tiny.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[电脑硬盘里的数据，特别是个人创作的数据，对于个人来说价值非常高，一旦硬盘损坏，或电脑丢失，个人的数据都会面临永久损失的风险，因此做好数据备份是一个重要而长远的任务，怎么最好个人数据备份，以下是备份个人电脑硬盘数据的几种常见方法。


数据分类


做备份前，首先要将数据进行分类，一类是个人创作的数据，例如Office文件、TXT文件、照片等等，一类是从网上下载的数据，两类数据采取不同的备份策略。


通常情况下，硬盘可以按照上面的分类进行划分，C盘为操作系统盘，D盘为个人创作数据的盘，E盘为网上下载的软件、游戏等非个人创作的数据。


个人创作数据的备份


一般来说，个人创作的数据通常不会超过100G，并且文件可能具有多个历史版本，历史版本的文件可能也比较重要，这类数据就需要使用“同步盘”进行备份，常见的同步盘包括Dropbox、OneDrive、Google Drive、坚果云，百度网盘同步盘等等。利用这种云存储服务将数据备份到互联网上的远程服务器。这样即使电脑损坏或丢失，还可以通过云存储服务访问和恢复数据。如果文件错误编辑，还可以通过文件的历史版本还原以前的文件。


如果使用iPhone，那么照片的备份还有一个选项，就是iCloud，这个云服务和iPhone紧密结合，是备份iPhone照片的最佳选择之一。


非个人创作数据的备份


除了个人数据之外，我们还会从网上下载各类其他数据，例如电影、电视剧、软件、游戏、音乐等等，这些文件通常很大，有数T之多，备份的方法就以下几种：


1. 外部硬盘备份：使用外部硬盘驱动器将数据从电脑硬盘复制到外部存储设备。连接外部硬盘，然后使用文件管理工具将文件和文件夹复制到外部硬盘上。


2. 网盘：利用网盘服务将海量数据备份到互联网上的网盘服务器上。对于电影和电视剧来说，常见的网盘服务有百度网盘、阿里云盘、迅雷云盘等等，这三个网盘都有TV版，可以在电视机上播放网盘里存储的电影和电视剧，非常方便。


使用网盘存储文件存在和谐的问题，对一些可能被和谐的电影和电视剧，可以将其使用ZIP等工具加密打包上传到网盘，打包文件密码可以保存在文件名上，以防忘记。


对于游戏来说，建议使用steam、战网等游戏平台购买正版数字游戏，游戏在平台有安装包，游戏存档也在云端，这样游戏软件和存档都不会存在丢失的问题。


对于其他类型的数据，例如软件、压缩包文件等等，可以都使用网盘或外部硬盘备份，敏感数据可以加密，并保存好密码。


总的来说，无论选择哪种备份方法，都需要确保定期备份数据并存储在安全的地方，同时，检查备份文件的完整性，并测试恢复数据的过程，以确保备份成功且可用。]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[中国淡出超算 TOP500 榜单

最新的一期超级计算机 TOP500 榜单已经出炉，前十名和上一期一样，没有变化。美国橡树岭国家实验室的 Frontier 仍然是唯一上榜的 E 级的超大规模系统。在榜单中的排名前列的中国超算还是太湖之光和天河 2A，分别位列第 7 和第 10。在此次榜单中，中国有 134 台超算，2023 年只增加了一台吉利公司的超算。而之前的一些论文中的数据透露，中国还有更强大的超算，但是没有显示在榜单中。


消息来源：The Register



老王点评：显然，中国已经不再需要参加这种榜单的排名了。原因大家都懂。




微软展示云电脑 Windows 365 Boot

微软在 Build 2023 上展示了一个技术预览，让物理 PC 可以启动到在 Azure 中运行的虚拟 PC，而不是从其本地驱动器运行 Windows。这项名为 “Windows 365 Boot” 的技术被认为是 “共享设备的一个伟大的解决方案，在那里用独特的用户身份登录可以把你带到你自己的个人和安全的云电脑。”不过微软没有说这项技术何时能普遍使用。


消息来源：The Register



老王点评：云电脑并不是什么稀奇的事情。但是我依然还是喜欢用本地电脑 —— 哦，不，我不使用 Windows。




PyPI 正在减少存储的 IP 地址数据

之前，我们 报道 过，Python 官方软件包库 PyPI 应美国司法部要求向其提供了几个用户的数据，包括 IP 地址等信息。这引来了一些用户对隐私的关切。PyPI 表示，它正在努力减少它所存储的用户数据，其目的不是为了无法回应合法的信息要求，而是为了只存储必要的最低数量的数据，以免使用户受到不必要的隐私侵犯。但这一努力早在 2020 年就在进行，自从此次提供了数据后，又被重新启动。


消息来源：The Register



老王点评：监管与隐私之间的平衡，确实难以拿捏。不知道国外有没有要求必须保存什么数据、保存多久的要求。]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[在本文中，我们将介绍如何在 RHEL 9/8 上使用 Pacemaker 设置两节点高可用性 Apache 集群。


Pacemaker 是适用于类 Linux 操作系统的高可用性集群软件。Pacemaker 被称为“集群资源管理器”，它通过在集群节点之间进行资源故障转移来提供集群资源的最大可用性。Pacemaker 使用 Corosync 进行集群组件之间的心跳和内部通信，Corosync 还负责集群中的投票选举（Quorum）。

先决条件

在我们开始之前，请确保你拥有以下内容：


两台 RHEL 9/8 服务器

Red Hat 订阅或本地配置的仓库

通过 SSH 访问两台服务器

root 或 sudo 权限

互联网连接


实验室详情：


服务器 1：node1.example.com（192.168.1.6）

服务器 2：node2.exaple.com（192.168.1.7）

VIP：192.168.1.81

共享磁盘：/dev/sdb（2GB）


事不宜迟，让我们深入了解这些步骤。

1、更新 /etc/hosts 文件

在两个节点上的 /etc/hosts 文件中添加以下条目：

192.168.1.6  node1.example.com
192.168.1.7  node2.example.com


2、安装高可用包 Pacemaker

Pacemaker 和其他必需的包在 RHEL 9/8 的默认包仓库中不可用。因此，我们必须启用高可用仓库。在两个节点上运行以下订阅管理器命令。

对于 RHEL 9 服务器：

 Add the following to your ~/.bashrc

 If you're "building" your $PS1 piece-by-piece like I am (read the post linked above for more info), just add the following to your ~/.bashrc, wherever it should go in your $PS1's "load-order":
 PS1+=$PICK_A_COLOR # Set a color PS1+="[" # optional PS1+=$TTY_NUM # Add the TTY number PS1+="]" # optional PS1+=$RESET_COLOR # Reset color to avoid weird behavior

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[在这一章中，在实例的帮助下，学习如何使用函数并从中返回值。


就跟任何现代编程语言一样，Rust 也有函数。

你已经熟悉的函数是 main 函数。这个函数在程序启动时被调用。

但是其他函数呢？在本文中，你将学习如何在 Rust 程序中使用函数。

函数的基本语法

你可能已经在我们声明 main 函数时知道了这一点，不管怎么样，还是让我们看一下声明函数的语法。

// 声明函数
fn function_name() {
    <statement(s)>;
}

// 调用函数
function_name();


来让我们看一个简单的函数，它将字符串 "Hi there!" 打印到标准输出。

fn main() {
    greet();
}

fn greet() {
    println!("Hi there!");
}



📋 与 C 不一样的是，不管你是否要在声明或定义之前调用函数都没有关系。只要这个函数在 某个地方 被声明了，Rust 就会处理它。


正如预期，它的输出如下：

Hi there!


这挺简单的。让我们把它提升到下一个级别。让我们创建一个接受参数并返回值的函数。有没有参数和有没有返回值这两者之间无关。

使用函数接受参数

声明一个接受参数的函数的语法如下：

// 声明函数
fn function_name(variable_name: type) {
    <statement(s)>;
}

// 调用函数
function_name(value);


你可以把函数参数想象成一个传递给函数的 元组。它可以接受多种数据类型的参数，而且你可以接受任意多个参数。所以，你不必局限于接受相同类型的参数。

与某些语言不同的是，Rust 没有 …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We've all seen beautiful $PS1 prompts, but from what I can tell most people seem to write theirs all on one line. I suppose if you use some kind of external tool to build the prompt it's not so bad, but it makes it total hell for editing the prompt by hand if you ever feel like it.
 This also applies to other variables, but $PS1 is usually a rather complex variable so it's a good example. Mine is quite complex, and there's no way it would have reached this level of personalization if I hadn't discovered this trick.
 How it works
 Bash has a simple syntax for slapping something on the end of a variable: +=. This is called concatenation.
 So, for example say we have a variable foo="bar", and you want to add " bat" to the end of it. Just do it: foo+=" bat". Now $foo equals "bar bat".
 You can…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[《飞翔的旅驿——清末民初文学与文化》，陈建华主编，商务印书馆，2023年6月即出

“清末民初”作为文学史分期词语，含有数十年来学科划分及其观念的变迁，此刻在我记忆中浮现阅读和思考的轨辙，约略言之不无温故知新之效。自二十世纪五十年代起正典文学史有“近代”和“现代”之分，前者始自鸦片战争，后者始自“五四”运动。章培恒先生在本世纪初发表《关于中国现代文学的开端》一文说明在二十世纪初的中国文学中已出现鲁迅所说的“人性的解放”的因素，具现代文学“开端”的意义。如果“近代”分期以政治、经济为基础，那么章先生的“现代”意味着回归人性和文学自身，在他的《中国文学史新著》中可看到人性的文学如何从上古、中世到近世经历了迂回曲折的发展历程。虽然八十年代中期黄子平、陈平原和钱理群就提出“二十世纪中国文学”的构想，而章先生强调“人性的解放”，是为其文学史书写所定的精神原则。如他对徐枕亚《玉梨魂》的高度评价，打破古今、新旧、雅俗的成见，至今仍具启示性。另一端是李欧梵先生，近年来一再主张中国现代文学从晚清开始，这得追溯到他的1973年出版的《中国现代作家浪漫的一代》，书里把林纾、苏曼殊和徐志摩、郁达夫等同样看作“现代”作家，这和当时流行的“近代”和“现代”的文学史概念很不一样，特别是林纾臭名昭著，和新文学形同冰炭，现在我们对他的认识已大为改观。对于晚清研究，不能不提王德威先生的《被压抑的现代性》，除“谴责”之外对“狎邪”“侠义”和“科幻”等小说类型展开论述，晚清小说如惊艳还魂，令人刮目相看。另外对于“重写文学史”厥功甚伟的是范伯群先生及其研究团队，2000年出版的《中国近现代通俗文学史》凝聚着他们多年的辛勤耕耘，“近现代”意谓起自《海上花列传》至民国时期的“通俗”作品的研究范围。他们还编著了许多“礼拜六-鸳鸯蝴蝶派”作家评传、作品选集等，有效拓展了文学观念、空间与市场。

 which is available since February 2022 for Linux and runs quite well.
 https://github.com/86Box/86Box/releases/
 But their manager application (to handle more than one emulated PC system) was still only Windows with a lot of Win32 calls and such. It runs under Wine, but okay, that's possible, but a hassle.
 So, my fork of the manager now runs under Linux (I test with Ubuntu 20.04 myself):
 https://github.com/xafero/86BoxManager/releases
 I'm sharing it here because maybe there are others who like to install a 486 DX system, too ;-)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Niels Provos reflects
on 25 years of experience with Bcrypt and ponders the future of password
security in a ;login article.


	Bcrypt's endurance can be attributed to several other factors
	beyond our intentional algorithm design. Its wide availability in
	open-source implementations has facilitated widespread adoption and
	integration into various systems. According to Wikipedia, there are
	implementations of bcrypt in C, C++, C#, Embarcadero Delphi,
	Elixir, Go, Java, JavaScript, Perl, PHP, Python, and
	Ruby. Moreover, bcrypt's focus on computational cost scaling makes
	it an attractive choice for large Internet services compared to
	newer algorithms like Argon2, which also scale in memory
	consumption.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[“AI不会让你失业，会用AI的人才会让你失业。”打出这样的宣传标语，培训他人使用ChatGPT成为了近期最火爆的副业。在部分知识付费社群上，短短三个月内涌现出大量以培训ChatGPT技能为名的课程。


2023年，美国OpenAI公司研发的ChatGPT成为了火遍全球的人工智能软件，它在翻译、文案撰写、查资料等多方面的智能表现，引发了人类对于失业的担忧。


OpenAl 3月发布论文预言，美国80%的工作都会受到AI的影响；高盛则预测，生成式AI会导致劳动力市场受到重大冲击，使全球3亿个工作岗位实现自动化，并且美国7%的工作岗位将被AI取代。


一时之间，学习使用ChatGPT从而更好地完成工作，成为职场风潮。市场需求催生之下，程序员、自媒体从业者纷纷开班培训教授职场人士如何使用AI。在ChatGPT大批量取代人类工作之前，已经有人率先利用ChatGPT变现。


据记者在知识付费平台上注意到，一位自称是前360技术总监、担任过独角兽公司CTO的博主发布的ChatGPT学习课程，两个月时间已经吸引了超过2万名学员。


在这门单人收费368元的课程中，该博主已经陆续更新了超过5000篇内容，总营收达到861万元。另有头部博主在不到70天的时间里，运营课程带来了超过330万元的收入。


据不完全统计，仅在单一学习平台上，以“教你使用ChatGPT”为名开设相关课程的团队就超过了20个。这些课程收费通常不超过500元，培训内容包括办公应用高效生成PPT、AI绘图、自媒体内容生成等。


与此同时，教人使用ChatGPT也已成为招聘市场上火爆的副业。


据记者在招聘平台搜索发现，ChatGPT兼职讲师的时薪在50至100元，岗位要求包括“对OpenAI的ChatGPT3.5至上线最新版本熟练使用。”GPT研究员岗位月薪则能达到2至4万元，但需要员工能够利用ChatGPT帮助公司研发团队提高算法能力。


需要注意的是，最火副业引来各路人马纷纷下场创业，希望在行业红利期分得一杯羹，但学员却很难鉴别培训课程品质的优劣。对外经济贸易大学数字经济与法律创新研究中心主任许可接受记者采访表示，从法律角度来说，课程属于信用品，即使在消费之后，用户可能也不清楚其效益如何。


许可建议，想要学习的职场人士可以关注培训班的授课老师是否长期关注该领域。如果教师并非从事自然语言处理或研发工作，也需具备丰富的实操技能和教学能力。另外，之前学员发布的课程评价第三方测评内容也是重点参考方向。


针对中英文的环境中都涌现出大量ChatGPT培训课，许可指出，只要培训资质合法且课程内容不涉及传销等不良内容，发展高薪副业都属于正常的市场竞争，但部分培训者在宣传课程中所打出的口号却存在误导性。


“未来，职场人的发力点是发展不会被AI取代的能力，而非比较谁更会操作ChatGPT。”许可认为，当发展副业的“老师们”进行夸张宣传从而获利时，容易给人们传播紧张焦虑的情绪。对于大多数职场人来说，应当在提高自身的人工智能素养的同时，抱有理性的态度去对待新技术。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[红帽利用 Ansible 数据训练运维 AI

红帽和 IBM 创建了 Project Wisdom，这使用户能够将编码命令作为一个简单的英语句子来输入，例如，“部署网络应用栈” 或 “安装 Nodejs 依赖”。这发展成了红帽的第一个重要的人工智能产品：Ansible Lightspeed。这种生成性人工智能服务提供了更一致、更准确、更快速的自动化。它使用自然语言处理，并与代码助理集成，以访问建立在红帽的 Kubernetes 服务 OpenShift 上的 IBM 基础模型。这些 LLM 是建立在红帽已知的正确数据上的，是基于经过测试的、高质量的数据和代码，而不是某个人为了赶时间而匆忙写出来的垃圾。


消息来源：The Register



老王点评：这才叫 “AIOps”。不过我总是还有点担忧，LLM 这种模型即便是在可信的数据上进行训练的，偶尔也会有“幻觉”出现，那对于运维可能就是灾难了。




Windows 11 也将有应用的云备份功能

智能手机用户长期以来一直享有云备份和恢复的功能，你可以购买一个新设备，在第一次启动时，只需登录你的平台账户，从云备份中选择 “恢复我的应用程序”。而现在，Windows 11 也能做到这一点。微软在 Build 2023 上宣布了这一功能。如果用户选择恢复，Windows 11 将自动应用旧的墙纸和设置，甚至开始预装你在旧电脑上安装的应用程序。一旦用户进入桌面，他们会看到任务栏中已经有了他们之前钉住的所有应用程序，点击它们将从微软商店自动下载。


消息来源：Windows Central



老王点评：这种功能我们在智能手机使用的怡然自得，可为什么换成 Windows 我就觉得那么不放心呢？




亚马逊关闭其中国的安卓应用商店

在亚马逊将其 Kindle 电子书阅读器撤出中国的 11 个月后，它又宣布在中国关闭其安卓应用商店。这个安卓应用商店几乎没有人使用，它为其基于安卓的 Fire 平板提供了应用市场。这个平板每年在全球销售约 1600 万台，而在中国销售更少。此外，亚马逊的安卓应用市场上的应用也提供给 Windows 的安卓子系统。


消息来源：The Register



老王点评：反正也没人使用。不过，对于 Windows 的安卓子系统用户，可能下载应用就麻烦了，但这个可能也没啥人用。]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[楼劲（章静 绘）

今年初，上海人民出版社出版的《中古政治与思想文化史论》选编了十余年来楼劲先生在中古政治史、制度史、思想史上的学术成果和相关思考。治史四十余年，楼先生认为这本书于他而言具有某种总结的意义，既有专精的研究，也有对整个中古时期的观照。书中反复出现的“王朝体制”，是楼劲先生近些年着意强调的概念。何谓王朝，中古王朝与过往研究语境中的“王朝”有何不同？如何理解王朝与王道的内涵？近期，《上海书评》专访楼劲先生，谈谈他所思考的中古王朝与王道理念。
您书中的很多章节都是之前发表过的文章，也有一些是首次发表，相关文章是如何取舍和安排的，能否简单做一说明？
楼劲：《〈论语·尧曰〉首章补疏》和《十六国北朝的“北族革命”及其影响》以前没有发表过，其他都是公开发表过的论文，这次一并收录到书中，分为四编。
第一编为《“革命”三论》，探讨王朝易代问题。第三编中《〈论语·尧曰〉首章补疏》一文可以视为本编导论，属于对革命论思想源头的讨论。本编内容统揽了后面诸编，大体上是我对中国古代政治哲学及其践履之况的一个探讨，其特点是从易代革命的实际切入，观察和讨论相关思想观念，既展示中古政治文明的发展历程，也呈现其光明和黑暗错综复合的实态。两汉至魏晋是中古政治思想奠基的关键期，也是相关政治实际的典型展开期。从中可以看到一种意识形态和统治指导思想的确立，总是各种历史因素交汇聚合的产物，必须经历反复交锋打磨，也就一定会与一些特定的大事相互缠绕。这段历史，尤其是改朝换代的历程，就凝聚了这样的内涵：关于革命的理论在退化，但王道理念在逐渐深入人心，王朝体制也在逐渐成熟之中。第二编《制度抉义》考察的是王朝体制的具体构成及其问题，所收各文讨论了中古一些重要制度的政治和民族关系的内涵，揭示了贯穿其间的意识形态化历程，反映了王朝体制在若干具体方面的发展样态。在展示这些构件的同时，本编也勾勒出另一条线索，当一种思想和观念…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I just wanted to share this.
 ​
 Brief intro: I got curious as to why Ubuntu uses two different packaging systems by default, those being APT and Snap, so I started searching online and found that snaps are obviously slower than PPAs but I thought that it couldn't make that much of a difference, and yet... I wanted to atleast try and see what would happen, as this ordeal was not done on my main system anyway.
 Disclaimer: I used a script I found called ubuntu-debullshit! to do all the work for me because I'm a lazy-ass person. (I used option 1, a.k.a. apply all, for context)
 I'm just going to cut to the chase:
 ​
 Results on a Fujistu-Siemens Amilo LI2727 Laptop with Ubuntu Desktop 22.04 LTS (Fresh, minimal install)
 (Pentium T2390 + 2GB DDR2 533 + Intel Mobile 965 Express)
 ​
 Boot time (from power button pressed to a usable desktop)
 Before: 1 minute and 3 seconds
 After: 22 seconds
 ​
 Video playback
 Software: Firefox with UBlock Origin
 Source: Youtube 720p in Fullscreen mode
 Before: 100% CPU usage, dropped 1-2 frames every second
 After: 65-70% CPU usage, 0 dropped frames
 ​
 So, as you can see, this little experiment brought my system from a performance just marginally better than a default Windows 10 install to something much closer to the maximum this laptop has to offer, rendering it actually usable for daily tasks.
 Since I've seen other posts with 'dpkg vs snap', I know this isn't a new topic, it's just that in all of those posts I've never seen any claim other than 'it does occupy more space' and a nebuolous 'it's slower' I wanted to provide some actual numbers to atleast give an idea of the amount of 'wasted' computational power.
 I hope this information will be useful for someone.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[5月27日消息，天涯社区曾经是中文互联网最具影响力的网站之一，也是许多初代网民的青春回忆。但自从2023年4月25日起，这个成立于1999年的老牌论坛就无法访问了，引发了网友们的热议和怀念。


天涯社区的创始人之一、前董事长邢明今日在社交平台上首度回应了广大网友关心的问题，称这是因为资金问题导致的暂时停摆，并没有放弃恢复网站的希望。他还保证，天涯社区的数据不会丢失，会尽力保留网友们在天涯上发过的帖子、博文和神帖。


邢明称：“数据不会丢失，天涯从未放弃。”他表示：“原来我们只是想低调地休整一段时间，筹集到资金再把它恢复起来，但是没想到网友的反应这么的热烈。”邢明还称：将把数据的恢复与保存放在第一位，与政府、电信合作沟通，确保网友们的“回忆”能够留存下来。


据悉，为了重启天涯社区，另一位创始人之一宋铮发起了“七天七夜，重启天涯”直播义卖活动，希望通过直播带货的方式，筹集到300万的资金支付电信机房的费用，活动得到了大量网友和天涯前员工的支持和参与。据悉，重启天涯直播义卖将于5月28日20点开始，连播七天。


谈及重启天涯活动，邢明坦言，“我没有想到网友们有如此大的热情，出乎我们的意料，这对我们而言是一种激励，同时，我们也感到自责，没有为大家维护好平台。”邢明补充道，“我们对未来充满信心，没有想过放弃。”值得一提的是，有一些员工建议是不是效仿俞敏洪做直播带货，邢明表示，天涯的特性有点不一样，包括他个人也不是这个特性。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[内疚通常被认为是一种消极的情绪，但通过很好地引导它，你可以取得令人惊讶的成功。


最近，一位朋友兼同事问我是否有兴趣一起在会议上发言。我很惊喜，因为我对他们展示的项目贡献不大，但我表达了兴趣。我们开会讨论演讲内容，那时我才知道我被邀请参加的真正原因：会议的 多样性、公平性和包容性（DEI） 倡议要求至少有一名发言人不是男性。我被冒犯了。感觉我被邀请参加会议只是因为我的性别，而不是基于我的能力。

我的朋友向我保证，这并不是邀请我的唯一原因。他们需要新的贡献者，因为有很多工作要做，他们希望我可以帮助填补这一空白。

我考虑了一下，并试图理解为什么会有 DEI 的举措。我还想到了硬币的另一面，想做演讲的人不能做演讲，除非他们找到一个来自少数群体的人和他们一起演讲。

当我想到大局和这个机会将给我带来的好处时，我决定放弃我的自我伤害。一旦我放下被冒犯的感觉，我就意识到，我在介绍我没有直接贡献的东西时也感到非常不舒服。我的道德观并不认同这一点。我怎么可能踏上舞台，充当我没有努力过的东西的代言人？

决心提供更多帮助

我对这个项目做了一些研究。这项技术对我来说并不完全陌生，而且我很好地掌握了它所要实现的基本原理。事实上，它的总体目标让我感到很兴奋，可以做出贡献。如果做得好，它对用户来说将是超级有用的。

我下定决心，只有当我有机会十倍地回馈社区并成为一个关键的贡献者时，我才会继续这个演讲机会。我的朋友非常愿意帮助我走上这条道路。

带着这个决心，我们提交了我们的演讲。我的共同演讲者都很支持我，让我感到很受欢迎。他们说，只要我对这个项目有兴趣，有热情，其他都不重要。

参加这次会议是一个巨大的机会，它对我产生了如此 积极的影响。我遇到了很多开源社区的有经验的人，我感到很受鼓舞！我学到了很多新的东西！我从会议上的人和各种小组、会议和讨论中学到了 很多 新东西。我们的演讲很顺利，我认为在这样一个大型会议上发表演讲是一个相当大的成就。

然而，会议一结束，我的 内疚感 就开始发作了。

内疚是一种动力

我觉得我欠这个社区和那些给我这个机会的人。我想专注于我所做的承诺，但在其他更优先的事情的阻碍下，这很难。每当我偏离我的计划时，内疚感就会让我坚持下去。它提醒我，我必须回馈给我这样一个好机会的社区。经过几个月的挣扎和折腾，我可以自豪地说，我没有放弃。今天，我是这个项目的一个积极贡献者。

我喜欢它带来的挑战，我喜欢解决项目领域中的一些关键问题。我还能够带头在我们的下游生态系统中实施这个上游项目。作为锦上添花，我再次被邀请与团队一起展示，并向社区介绍项目的最新情况。这一次，不是因为 DEI 的倡议，因为比例已经平衡了。

感到内疚毕竟不是那么糟糕！

我很高兴我抓住了这个机会，我也很高兴这对每个参与者来说都是一个双赢的局面。如果没有人找我做共同主持人，我可能永远也不会参与这个项目，那将是多么大的失误啊！我很感激这些人！我很感谢那些给我这个机会并支持我的人。

我可能不是唯一面临这种情况的女性。我想告诉所有的女性，如果这样的机会出现，没有必要感到内疚，或者你“欠”别人的，或者任何形式的压力。如果你确实感到这种压力，那么就把这种情绪变成一种武器，用它来做好事！

这样就和标题联系起来了吗？因为我说的是我如何把这种内疚感作为一种动力，但也说首先不要感到任何内疚、

另一方面，不确定我们是否应该将文章的标题改为“DEI 机会在开始时可能不舒服，但有优势”之类的东西？无论如何，我对这篇文章总体上是满意的！

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[你已尽力而为，但提醒仍然有帮助！




你经常忘记事情吗？ 需要一点帮助来记住你的任务吗？ 🤔

虽然你可以使用 Linux 的笔记应用，但它们可能无法有效地提醒你任务和事情。

“Reminders” 应用可以成为你的小帮手，提醒你未完成的工作。

让我们看看它能为你做些什么。

Reminders：概述 ⭐

Reminders 是一个简单的 Linux 开源提醒应用，主要使用 Python 编写。它在一个紧凑的包中包含了一些很好的特性。

你也可以将其用作 待办事项列表应用 之一。

当你启动该应用时，你会看到一个精简的主屏幕，所有提醒都井井有条。

当然，我创建了一些你可能想要关注的有趣任务！👀




📋 默认情况下，你所有的提醒都按时间排序； 你可以使用左上角的切换按钮更改它。


你可以使用右下角的加号按钮创建新提醒。你可以给它起一个名字、一个简短的描述、将它设置为一个重要的提醒，并设置日期/时间。

你还可以将其设置为以特定的时间间隔重复，例如分钟、小时、天和周。

当提醒时间到了时，它会向你显示通知并播放声音通知你。



犯了一个错误？

你可以通过选择现有提醒并单击 “编辑Edit” 按钮来编辑它们。



你还可以进入“即将到来的提醒Upcoming Reminders”类别以查看已安排的提醒。



同样，你可以通过进入特定类别来查看过去的提醒和已完成的提醒：“过去的提醒Past Reminders” 和 “已完成的提醒Completed Reminders”。



Reminders 还支持自定义列表，可以整齐地组织提醒事项，以便快速轻松地访问。

请允许我向你展示如何创建列表。

首先，你必须创建一个自定义列表，方法是单击边栏中的 “编辑列表Edit Lists” 按钮创建一个。



然后，在创建新提醒时，在 “位置Location” 选项下，选择你刚刚创建的列表。


📋 你还可以在编辑现有提醒时选择列表。




现在，单击侧边栏菜单中的列表以查看其下方的提醒。




💡 这让我印象深刻。Reminders 有可选支持，链接一个人的微软帐户以与他们的微软 To Do 列表同步。


这是一个非常简单的链接过程，能够调整获取待办事项的自动刷新频率。



Reminders 在一个非常紧凑的包中提供了一些很棒的功能，微软 To Do 集成可能会吸引正在寻找具有此类功能的 Linux 应用的用户。

最接近的替代方案是 “Go For It!”，这是另一个提供类似用户体验的 Linux 待办事项应用（未活跃维护，但足够好）。

📥 获取 Reminders

你可以从 Flathub 下载 Reminders 应用或使用 GitHub 上的源代码构建它。

他们有将其移植到 Windows 的计划，但它可能发生也可能不会发生。

如果你已经安装了 Flatpak，你可以在终端输入以下命令来安装它：

flatpak install flathub io.github.dgsasha.Remembrance



下载 Reminders（Flathub）


💬 你使用什么待办事项或提醒应用来跟踪你想做的事情？ 在下面的评论中分享你的选择。

 flatpak. 
 It can't be used with other package distribution methods, apt, Nix, raw binaries. 
 It can't fine-tune network sandboxing.

I would consider Nix superior, just a gut feeling, especially when https://github.com/obsidiansystems/ipfs-nix-guide exists. The integration of P2P with opensource is perfect and I have never seen it elsewhere. Flatpak is limiting as I can't I use it to sandbox things not installed by it.
 And no way Firejail is usable.
 flatpak can't work with netns
 I have a focus on sandboxing the network, with proxies, which they are lacking, 2.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[微软发布 Azure Linux 正式版

在内部使用 Azure Linux 两年，并从 2022 年 10 月开始公开预览后，微软本周终于正式提供其 Azure Linux。Azure Linux 是 Azure Kubernetes 服务（AKS）的一个开源容器主机操作系统，它针对 Azure 进行了优化，旨在使开发人员更容易使用微软的工具来部署和管理容器工作负载。Azure Linux 源于微软的 CBL-Mariner 项目，是“自我独立的 Linux 发行版”，而非衍生自 Ubuntu 或 Fedora。


消息来源：The Register



老王点评：这不是微软的第一个 Linux 发行版，也不是最后一个发行版。




使用 XFS 的系统暂时不要升级到 Linux 6.3

上周以来，多个用户已经报告了在升级到 Linux 6.3 稳定内核时，XFS 文件系统的元数据损坏问题。当他们在基于 XFS 的服务器上运行 Linux 6.3 时，服务器不断崩溃。据报道，Linux 6.4 内核对一些受影响的用户来说工作正常，这让人觉得一些补丁可能没有很好地回传到较新的 Linux 6.3 的小版本。


消息来源：Phoronix



老王点评：这比较罕见，无论是 Linux 稳定版，还是文件系统，出现这样的问题太不应该了。或许我们该担忧 Linux 内核的质量把控了？当然，谨慎的系统管理员从来在更新上都是“懒惰”的。




Bitwarden 进军无密码安全领域

可悲而简单的事实是，密码泄露正变得像人们闯红灯一样普遍。密码机制已经过时，大约一半的 IT 决策者认为他们使用的应用程序中缺乏无密码设计是主要原因。而无密码技术中的 密码钥匙Passkey 可以通过设备上已有的密码、指纹、面部识别等，来替代用户的账户密码登录其它服务。它不仅消除了对密码、用户名和双因素认证（2FA）的需求，而且还通过减轻钓鱼攻击的风险来增强用户的安全性。流行的开源密码管理程序 Bitwarden 推出了 Passwordless.dev，这是一个开发者工具包，用于将无密码技术集成到网站和应用程序中。


消息来源：The Newstack



老王点评：作为著名的密码管理软件，面对无密码时代的来临，也不得不“与时俱进”。]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[《夜读抄》，周作人著，上海三联书店2019年5月出版，48.00元

前年年底从网上买了不同出版社的几种周作人自编集，因为都没有出全，也就选了几本，和床头那套河北教育版的混杂在一起，可以随时翻翻。时间既久，便有了些感触，对上海三联书店的那几本情有独锺。首先是封面招人喜欢，我不怎么注意上面画的是什么东西，只是那白纸一角的略微浓艳的彩色就让人心动，不由想起鲁迅说的那只电灯上的灯罩，“雪白的纸，折出波浪纹的叠痕，一角还画出一枝猩红色的栀子”。周作人的文章涩而不枯，实际上更多的是腴，一味的素淡也未必合于他文章的本色。书中的版式设计和精美的插图都很见匠心，堪称巧而倩。我平素看的是河北教育版，两相比较，上海三联本（以下称“新版”）的行距疏朗和天地开阔真让人悦目。河北教育版呢，——人家白送我的书，我真不应该那么挑剔——可惜多用了琐碎的“题花”“尾花”，就不止点污素面，甚至有些让人感到举体拖沓了。
以上说的是新版让人喜爱的地方，真的不必去看书的内容，翻阅起来就让人产生愉悦的。所以前几天当当的“书香节”，我就想再把新出的品种补齐，可是奇怪的是，好像对前年的品种没有什么增加。正好一个偶然的机会和上海三联驻京的周青丰先生在电话中聊了聊，听他的意思，好像这书还是要继续出下去。我顺便说了我对这套书的好感，也提出一些疑问，周先生做了些解释。在电话中我也没有办法把自己的意思表达清楚，只好说另等机会吧。
我想对周青丰先生说的是书的文字部分，具体些，就是指此书采用的底本和校订方针等近于技术性的问题。因为这套书既然还要出下去，如果愚者千虑或有一得，也算对这套自己喜欢的书表示些芹献。于是就厚着脸皮，不管人家爱听不爱听，说将下去。
这套书的“出版说明”中说：“周作人作品，版本众多，各有优长，而以讹传讹、有些错误一再延续的，亦不鲜。为更切近作者、原版之意旨，本次再版本着‘周作人自编文集原本选印’的原则，一律按照周作…]]></summary>

Code-replay lets you run the coding session like a movie, I wrote a blog post on how I implemented this: https://logicboard.com/blog/code-replay
You can try out the demo here: https://logicboard.com/demo/:replay
And play around with the code editor here: https://logicboard.com/demo/
Logicboard also has an REPL shell, just type "start()" and hit enter in the output area.

微软总裁 Brad Smith 在华盛顿的一次演讲中，呼吁为最关键的人工智能颁发许可证，“我们将需要新一代的出口管制，至少是我们现有的出口管制的演变，以确保这些模型不被窃取或不被用于违反国家的出口管制要求”。他还呼吁采取措施，确保人们知道一张照片或视频何时是真实的。他说，“我们将不得不解决围绕深度造假的问题。我们将不得不特别解决我们所担心的大多数外国网络影响行动，即俄罗斯政府、中国、伊朗人已经在进行的各种活动。”

老王点评：如我之前评论的，AI 的威力不亚于核弹。而对这样的“武器”的控制，可能要比对芯片的控制更严格。




IBM 计划建立一个 10 万量子比特的量子计算机

去年年底，IBM 以一个包含 433 个量子比特（即量子信息处理的基本构件）的处理器打破了最大量子计算系统的记录。现在，该公司计划与东京大学和芝加哥大学合作，在 10 年内建造一台 10 万量子比特的机器。IBM 已经做了原则性验证实验，表明基于“互补金属氧化物半导体（CMOS）”技术的集成电路可以安装在冷量子比特旁边，只需几十毫瓦就能控制它们。除此之外，以量子为中心的超级计算所需的技术还不存在，这也是为什么需要大学研究机构参与的重要原因。


消息来源：Technology Review



老王点评：在量子计算方面，虽然我们也取得了很大进展，但就目前而言，美国的量子计算技术还是最强的。




谷歌搜索开始推出 ChatGPT 式的结果

谷歌的“搜索生成体验”计划将 ChatGPT 风格的生成性人工智能结果直接放在你的谷歌搜索结果页面中，出现在正常搜索结果上方的彩色方框中。这将是谷歌搜索结果有史以来最大的变化，这种设计有可能颠覆整个互联网。一个在桌面上搜索 “蓝牙音箱” 的例子截图显示，“赞助” 的购物广告之下的一个大蓝框中是人工智能结果，列出了关于每个扬声器的几个完全没有来源的声明和意见。大约两三个屏幕后才是指向更中立的外部网站的链接。


消息来源：Ars Technica



老王点评：感觉谷歌这一次是画猫不成反类犬。别最后将优势的搜索引擎市场也丢失了。]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Rust 和 Python 的优势互补。可以使用 Python 进行原型设计，然后将性能瓶颈转移到 Rust 上。


Python 和 Rust 是非常不同的语言，但它们实际上非常搭配。但在讨论如何将 Python 与 Rust 结合之前，我想先介绍一下 Rust 本身。你可能已经听说了这种语言，但可能还没有了解过它的细节。

什么是 Rust？

Rust 是一种低级语言，这意味着程序员所处理的东西接近于计算机的 “真实” 运行方式。

例如，整数类型由字节大小定义，与 CPU 支持的类型相对应。虽然我们很想简单地说 Rust 中的 a+b 对应于一条机器指令，但实际上并不完全是这样！

Rust 编译器链非常复杂。作为第一种近似的方法，将这样的语句视为 “有点” 真实是有用的。

Rust 旨在实现零成本抽象，这意味着许多语言级别可用的抽象在运行时环境中会被编译去掉。

例如，除非明确要求，对象会在堆栈上分配。结果是，在 Rust 中创建本地对象没有运行时成本（尽管可能需要进行初始化）。

最后，Rust 是一种内存安全的语言。也有其他内存安全的语言和其他支持零成本抽象的语言。但通常这些是两类不同的语言。

内存安全并不意味着不可能在 Rust 中出现内存违规。它确实意味着只有两种方式可能导致内存违规：


编译器的错误。

显式声明为不安全（unsafe）的代码。


Rust 标准库代码有很多被标记为不安全的代码，虽然比许多人预期的少。这并不意味着该语句无意义。除了需要自己编写不安全代码的（罕见的）情况外，内存违规通常是由基础设施造成的。

为什么会有 Rust 出现？

为什么人们要创建 Rust？是哪些问题没有被现有编程语言解决吗？

Rust 被设计成既能高效运行，又保证内存安全。在现代的联网世界中，这是一个越来越重要的问…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[嘉庆元年，文渊阁大学士、署理四川总督孙士毅死于军中。嘉庆帝降谕：“著于川省军需项下赏银五千两治丧，一切俱照公爵办理。著伊长孙孙均承袭伯爵。”因孙士毅长子先逝，孙均作为长孙护柩回原籍杭州。次年，孙均入京，嘉庆帝很亲切地问他：“年岁几何？从何人读书？”并授散秩大臣头衔，赏赐黄马褂、花翎，署护军统领。此后，南苑从猎，香山扈跸，孙均身姿矫健。

孙士毅像（《御制平定台湾二十功臣像赞》之一）

孙均，字贻孙，号古云。官三代，还是文艺青年，诗学唐代钱起和刘长卿，诗风和朱彝尊很近。他的府邸“云绘园”在宣武门内太平湖之西，当年很多诗人住在他家。清代诗人以女弟子多而闻名的，除了袁枚，就数陈文述。在云绘园住了三年，陈文述记录下与孙均“每多酬唱”的诗人：“如姚春木、查南庐、家荔峰、查梅史、严丽生、高爽泉、朱素人、果益亭、玉赐山、法梧门、吴谷人、杨蓉裳、孙渊如、秦小岘、伊墨卿、张船山、吴山尊、舒铁云、王仲瞿、孙子潇、许青士、吴兼山、朱野云、文䜩。”

钱杜画云绘园，座中人为孙均、陈文述

《国朝杭郡诗续辑》记述：“古云既袭封，日从羽林郎奔走，属车豹尾间，性不耐劳。”入了汉军正白旗籍，得了伯爵头衔，孙均并不轻松。后坠马伤足，干脆“引疾乞退，侨居吴下二十余年”。碍于尚在世的乾隆帝权威，当年孙士毅的饰终之典，在汉人大臣中实属尊荣。这次，孙均以残疾为由，奏请准其堂兄承袭爵位，嘉庆帝大怒，训斥孙均此举“殊属冒昧”，乃将孙均夺去爵位，革去旗籍。
嘉庆十一年，孙均离开北京，“初居常熟，继卜居吴门”。常熟是孙均母亲苏氏的故乡，“昆弟姻戚岁时过从”。苏氏在常熟颇是怡然。这一年，诗人郭麐在杭州结识孙均。而孙均则经常来往于杭州和苏州之间，“古云往来吴越，见必历月移时”。
孙均在江南并无祖屋可居，各处看房子，郭麐甚至劝他在嘉兴魏塘置房。写于嘉庆十二年的《灵芬馆诗三集》提到：“君方有相宅之意，余劝其卜居魏塘。”

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[《吏学指南》，(元)徐元瑞撰，郭超颖点校，凤凰出版社2022年6月出版，115页，48.00元

《吏学指南》又名《习吏幼学指南》，是元代徐元瑞编撰的一部吏学启蒙读物。徐氏字君祥，吴郡（今江苏苏州）人士，生平事迹不详，不过全书征引文献极为丰富，不下六十种，且经史子集之书皆有涉及，可见他除了是一名业务娴熟的老吏外，还是一位学养深厚的汉族儒士。元朝自世祖忽必烈始以吏治国，故而“聪明才智之士，志于功名者，以吏为师，儒者之道或几乎息矣”（蒋易《送余从善赴京序》）。科举不兴，由吏入官几成下层知识分子跻身仕途的唯一路径，正所谓“我元有天下，所与共治出刀笔吏十九”（揭傒斯《善余堂记》）。如此时代，出现《吏学指南》这样一部书乃是情理之中的事情。
关于《吏学指南》的编撰，徐氏自序说：“摘当令吏用之字及古法之名，首冠以历代吏师，终继于恕刻轨范，类成一书。”书前所冠“历代吏师类录”，先明胥吏上应上帝、土公两星，以得天文理据；又以时间为纲，列举历代吏师，将先秦至宋代有名的先贤都纳入了“吏”的范畴。由此，胥吏被塑造成承天而兴、渊源有自的职业。录中所列“吏师”在其所属时代多为高官，譬如周代之太傅周公旦、秦代之丞相李斯以及汉代之相国萧何，皆是如此，其意在激励为吏者砥砺奋进，取得较高的政治地位。元代吏制特殊，为吏亦可入仕，官、吏之间并无明显界限，“曰官曰吏，靡有轻贱贵重之殊。今之官即昔之吏，今之吏即后之官。官之与吏，情若兄弟。每以字呼，不以势分相临也”（吴澄《赠何忠德序》），可见徐氏所倡深合当时的政治环境。
不过，这种倡导似乎还能反映出更深层次的问题。元代穆虎彬所刻《吏学指南》有云梦县人石抹允序，其文盛称穆氏刻书美意，而于作者毫无褒赞，甚至但称徐氏，不称全名。其时石氏为承事郎，品秩不高，却可轻视徐氏，可见徐氏在撰此书乃至于传刻之时，亦不过普通胥吏。徐氏所在的吴郡原为南宋疆域，宋灭以后方才纳入元朝版图，隶属…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Having been in the works for quite a while, I now introduce cscroll: a very small, low dependency, and efficient file manager.
 cscroll does everything that a regular file manager does and more. Not only does it support vim keybindings, but it also supports emacs keybindings and regular keys as well (arrow keys etc.), making it very good at filesystem traversal. You can delete files, rename them, cut & paste them to different directories, search for them using regex, and more!
 Through the use of a configuration file and simple custom language, cscroll can be customized to your needs. File colors and default options can be changed in this way.
 By default, cscroll displays nerd icons based on presumed file type/contents, along with nice default colors and informative file identifiers. 
 Since cscroll is written in C and depends only on ncurses, it's easily portable to any Unix or Unix-like system, tested working on MacOS, FreeBSD, Android, and various Linux distributions. The mostly POSIX compatible Makefile also helps with this.
 The README goes much more in depth as to how cscroll is used as well as what it can and can't do, so be sure to check it out!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey /r/Linux!
 ​
 I am blind, and I have been since 2021. I have grown very accustomed to using NVDA on Windows, which is a free open source screen reader. It's great, and I have gotten used to navigation on an OS with a screen reader fairly well.
 ​
 The thing is, I'm planning on getting a full AMD PC build pretty soon, because I want to downsize, and get something cheaper with less power draw since I can't really utilize my gaming PC anymore. I was thinking about switching off of Windows as a result, and going with a far more lightweight operating system both for stability, but also because fuck Windows.
 ​
 So my question is, does Linux have good support for screen reading software? I don't think NVDA is available on Linux unfortunately, so I won't be able to use it there, albeit I would be able to virtualize Windwos and use it on a virtual machine, that doesn' tnecessarily help me with using my actual OS, which would be Linux. I'm probably thinking Kubuntu, beacuse I really liked it before when I trialed it.
 ​
 What do you guys think?
 ​
 THanks!

The highlights include two new backends and support for multiple scanout devices, along with "multiple fixes and internal changes that would further facilitate integration of functionality like color management or the ability to load up multiple backends at the same time". 

As we're heading towards having the ability to load multiple backends, two new ones have seen the day in this new release: backend-vnc, which is similar to backend-rdp, is based on aml and neatvnc libraries. It has TLS support and user authentication. The other backend added is the PipeWire one; it creates a node for each output and like the plugin with the same backend name, it can be used to capture Weston outputs for processing with other applications.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I was wondering if anyone else liked the idea of a system wide toggle for no history in all apps similar to a system toggle for dark mode.
 So at the moment I find myself turning off history manually in many apps: dolphin, Firefox, LibreOffice, VLC, kwrite etc. for privacy.
 It would be nice if apps could link to an API (new freedesktop.org spec?) and automatically respect the privacy mode set by the user just as dark mode respects user settings globally.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[5月7月，宝德计算(PowerLeader)，正式发布了基于x86架构的暴芯(Powerstar)处理器，同步还推出了台式机、工作站、工控机、瘦客户端等相关整机产品。


宝德称，该处理器的号称年销售目标为150万片，同时打造暴芯芯片研发制造基地，涵盖制造封装测试、晶圆测试及打磨、产业应用发展等产业链环节，还将继续致力于电源、内存、SSD、显卡等产品的宝德化。


根据官方公布的图片来看，暴芯处理器型号为“PL PSTAR P3-01105”，频率为3.7GHz，虽然未公布更多具体规格资料，但其外观和Intel LGA1200封装的10代酷睿完全一致，结合编号、频率看，貌似就是i3-10105的复刻版。


据悉，这款芯片近日现身GeekBench跑分库，其代号显示为英特尔Comet Lake处理器。


GeekBench跑分库信息显示，PSTAR P3-01105芯片采用4核心8线程设计，基础时钟频率为3.69GHz，最高频率为4388MHz，采用Socket 1200 LGA封装，32KB L1缓存、256KB L2缓存，6MB的L3缓存。


在GeekBench 5.4.1跑分中，显示该芯片的单核成绩为1010分，多核成绩为3585分。


据引国外科技媒体techpowerup报道，除了3.7GHz的时钟频率、内核配置以及名称不同外，这款芯片和英特尔的Core i3-10105相似度非常高。

storage and filesystem session at 
2023 Linux Storage, Filesystem,
Memory-Management and BPF Summit led by
Bart Van Assche, 
Viacheslav A. Dubeyko, and Naohiro Aota.  Zoned storage began with the
advent of shingled
magnetic recording (SMR) devices, but is now implemented by NVMe zoned
namespaces (ZNS) as well.
SMR devices can have multiple zones with different
characteristics, with some zones that can only be written in sequential
order, while other, conventional zones can be written in any order.  The
talk was focused on filesystems using the sequential type of zones
since the conventional zones are already well-supported in Linux and its
filesystems.]]></summary>

The app was built in an experimental style on Val Town. We’re trying to create a new web primitive that you can:
1. write like a function
2. run like a script
3. fork like a repo
4. install like an app
This is our 5th iteration of this same “HN Follow” app. We launched the 3rd version here on Hacker News six months ago[1], but it was very kindly removed from the front page by dang in favor of us launching Val Town itself first, which we did in January[2].
We’re trying to strike the right balance between something you can use and install with one click, and something you can infinitely customize. For example, you could fork `@rodrigoTello.hnFollowApp`[3] and change the input parameter from authors to a generic query, like I do here[4] to get notifications whenever “val town” is mentioned on HN. In addition to emailing myself (via `console.email`), I also send a message to our team’s Discord. The possibilities are endless, but it can also be overwhelming. We’re trying to find the balance where we help you navigate the space of possible integrations, without limiting you the way a no-code tool would. We would really appreciate your guys’ feedback and suggestions!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Meta 公布革命性可扩展模型架构 Megabyte

如今热捧的生成式 AI 模型，如 GPT-4 等，都是基于谷歌 2017 年提出的转换器Transformer架构。Meta 的研究人员认为该架构存在两大设计缺陷：其一，转换器模型需要关注所有令牌，当需要处理的令牌数以千计时，计算非常密集。其二，采用了串行计算模式，存在扩展性难题。Meta 公司发表论文，提出了一种革命性的可扩展模型架构 Megabyte。它将输入输出序列分割为“补丁”而不是“令牌”。Megabyte 可以并行进行计算，在每个补丁中，局部 AI 生成结果，全局模型负责协调所有补丁的最终输出，从而解决了扩展性问题。测试显示，有 15 亿参数的 Megabyte 模型比有 3.5 亿参数的转换器模型生成序列快 40%。Megabyte 模型能支持最多 120 万个令牌，相比下 GPT-4 是 3.2 万个令牌，Claude 是 10 万个令牌。


消息来源：Artisana



老王点评：令人称奇的是，在这次 AI 竞赛中，Meta 频繁地爆出新成果，虽然目前还不能完全盖住 OpenAI 和微软的风头，但是给人的感觉很有希望。




PyPI 向法庭提供了用户记录

Python 软件基金会披露，它根据美国司法部的要求提供了其软件包仓库 PyPI 的用户数据。法庭传票要求提供 5 个用户的用户名、网名、邮寄地址、公司地址、电子邮件地址、连接记录，会话时间和持续时长以及相关 IP 记录，以及，他们上传的 PyPI 软件包记录和这些软件包的下载 IP 日志等等。Python 软件基金会在与律师讨论之后满足了传票要求。

Thunderbird 发布全新徽标

在将近二十年之后，Thunderbird 项目发布了全新徽标。新徽标与 Mozilla Firefox 浏览器的徽标风格相似，开发者表示这是为了纪念其历史和与 Mozilla 的重要联系，向下一个 20 年前进。该徽标的设计师也是 Firefox 和 Thunderbird 原徽标的设计者。


消息来源：Thunderbird



老王点评：我觉得不如原来的好看，不过这不重要，重要的是，Thunderbird 终于有了更多实质性的改进，比如提供移动版本。]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[下面是适用于大多数现代 Linux 发行版中的 Wayland 的屏幕录制软件列表。


大多数主流 Linux 发行版（例如 Ubuntu 和 Fedora）中都默认使用现代的 Wayland 协议。然而，作为 X.Org 的继任者，Wayland 更加安全并且遵循现代标准，但这需要开发人员针对 Wayland 重新开发应用程序。

基于 X.Org 开发的 Linux 传统应用程序在大多数情况下都无法在 Wayland 上正常工作，除非进行修改。屏幕录制软件也属于这个范畴。许多广受欢迎的屏幕录制软件是为 X.Org 开发的，并且在 Wayland 中已无法工作。

但是有些仍然可以工作。在本文中，我将向你介绍我在 Wayland 会话中测试过，并且运行良好的一些屏幕录制软件。

适用于 Linux 发行版下 Wayland 的最佳屏幕录制软件应用

1、Kooha

首先介绍的是 Kooha，这是一款使用 GTK 编写的屏幕录制软件，支持 X11 和 Wayland。它是 GNOME 桌面环境下最快速、最简单的屏幕录制软件之一。该应用程序是提供顺畅录制体验的最佳 GNOME 应用之一。此实用工具支持硬件加速、定时器、多种输入源以及许多先进功能。主要功能如下：


在多显示器环境中，能够选择显示端口和窗口

硬件加速编码（默认禁用，但可以在设置中启用）

能够记录屏幕的特定区域

可以同时录制电脑声音和麦克风声音

指定制作录屏视频前的延时秒数

支持选择帧速率

支持多种媒体文件类型，包括：WebM、mp4、gif、Mkv 等






使用 Flatpak 安装 Kooha 非常容易。 为你的系统设置 Flatpak 和 Flathub，并运行以下命令进行安装：

flatpak install io.github.seadv…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[在本指南中，我们演示了如何在 Rocky Linux 9 / Alma Linux 9 上安装 KVM。


KVM 是 内核虚拟机Kernel Virtualization Machine 的简称，是一个为 Linux 内核设计的开源虚拟化平台。它是一种 1 类管理程序，或通常称为裸机管理程序。它允许用户创建和管理多台客户机，这些可以在 Linux 或 Windows 操作系统中创建。

与大多数虚拟化平台一样，它将硬件资源（如 CPU、内存、存储、网络、图形等）抽象化，并将它们分配给独立于宿主机运行的客户机。

先决条件


预装 Rocky Linux 9 / AlmaLinux 9

具有管理员权限的 sudo 用户

互联网连接


1、验证是否启用了硬件虚拟化

首先，你需要验证你的系统是否启用了虚拟化功能。在大多数现代系统上，此功能已在 BIOS 中启用。但可以肯定的是，你可以验证是否如图所示启用了虚拟化。

该命令探测是否存在 VMX（虚拟机扩展Virtual Machine Extension），它是英特尔硬件虚拟化的 CPU 标志，或 SVM，它是 AMD 硬件虚拟化的标志。

$ cat /proc/cpuinfo | egrep "vmx|svm"


从以下输出中，你可以看到我们的系统启用了英特尔硬件虚拟化：



2、在 Rocky Linux 9 / AlmaLinux 9 上安装 KVM

确保启用虚拟化后，下一步就是安装 KVM 和管理工具。为此，请运行以下 dnf 命令。

$ sudo dnf install qemu-kvm virt-manager libvirt virt-install virt-viewer virt-top bridge-utils  bridge-utils virt-…]]></summary>

美国记者埃里克·韦纳（Eric Weiner）的《幸福地理学：寻找世界上最幸福的地方》（原书名The Geography of Bliss: One Grump's Search for the Happiest Places in the World，2008；田亚曼、孙玮译，商务印书馆，2023年3月）首先是一部有趣的、有重要主题的旅行采访记，自出版后在西方读者中大受好评。作者在该书中记录了探访十个国家的经历，它们是荷兰、瑞士、不丹、卡塔尔、冰岛、摩尔多瓦、泰国、英国、印度和美国，虽然这十个国家的选择与次序很难说有明确的思想或学术意图，但是总有一些围绕着“寻找世界上最幸福的地方”这个主题而产生的逻辑思路和情感线索。作为常年驻外记者，韦纳见多识广，言谈风趣，在敏锐的观察中不乏严肃思考，这些都在这本书里有更为鲜明的体现。  
虽然书中有很多直观的观察和表述看起来有点八卦，但却是生动地反映了不同国家的差异性。例如说荷兰人的宽容体现在三件合法的事：毒品、卖淫和骑自行车，“只要采取一定的预防措施，这三项活动都很容易让人感到幸福，例如，骑自行车时戴着一顶头盔”（22页）。第三件事就能让我们有满满的幸福感，我们在学会走路之后就是学会骑自行车。又比如，他发现在丹麦、冰岛、瑞士、荷兰的人可以同时穿着袜子和凉鞋，我们很多人在小时候不都是这样的吗？在瑞士，晚上超过十点冲厕所是违法的，周日修剪草坪也是不准许的，自杀却完全合法。这对于懒人来说也是好事。作者的旅行记录与采访叙事看起来相当生动、不乏幽默，一些夸张的说法更能表现出不羁的想象力，例如在说到冰岛的总人口只有三十万的时候说“与肯塔基州路易斯维尔的人口或中国普通的公共汽车站的人数大致相同”（162页）。我不知道…]]></summary>

作为法国十七、十八世纪书简作家的杰出代表，塞维涅夫人（Madame de Sévigné，1626-1696）与哲人伏尔泰分享“不朽者”的荣光。后者写作技艺高超，令腓特烈大帝倾心不已——据说一日收不到伏尔泰来鸿，大帝便寝食难安——后来直接将哲人召来宫廷担任文学顾问，以慰饥渴。与之相似，塞维涅夫人书信经人转呈国王御览后，也得到很高的评价：太阳王路易十四的评语是“极为风趣”。然而，照塞维涅夫人《书信集》（中译本定名《爱从不平静》）编选者杜舍纳（Roger Duchêne）的看法，太阳王读到的是经过严格“筛选”的书信，未免以偏概全。倘若他能读到书信全集，或许会做出截然不同的论断。
从文学史看，推崇塞维涅夫人书信艺术的历来不乏其人。同时代的悲剧作家高乃依、思想家帕斯卡尔以及小说名家拉法耶特夫人（Madame de La Fayette）无不赞赏她亲切、自然的文风，认为这一“家常体”堪与蒙田媲美。十九世纪文艺理论家圣伯夫在名著《女性肖像》中用整个章节评述塞维涅夫人的写作与“风雅”（galant）社会风尚之间的联系，断言其文风与拉封丹相近——“精炼而自然”。小说家普鲁斯特对圣伯夫这位理论权威一向不以为然，唯独认同他对塞维涅夫人文风的解读——小说家本人在《追忆似水年华》中提及塞维涅夫人不下四五十处，崇拜之情溢于言表。当代英国著名传记作家南希·米特福德在《太阳王：凡尔赛宫的路易十四》一书中在不同场合直接引用塞维涅夫人多达十余次，可见这位书简作家对于“还原”历史是何等重要——“如果没有塞维涅夫人的书信和圣西蒙公爵的《回忆录》，后世对十七世纪法国社会生活的了解就会缺少很多细节”。
的确，塞维尼夫人的书信内容广泛，涉及路易十四时代社会、经济、文化、宗教、医学、教育、时尚等各个领…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I upgraded my computer this week to a modern Intel CPU and new Asus motherboard (google keywords: asus rog strix z790-f gaming wifi).
 Problem: ASUS recommends updating the ME firmware before updating the BIOS using Windows only software.
 I did the following to solve this:
  
Create a bootable USB FAT32 disk using fdisk and install something called Hiren's BootCD PE on it, which is a Windows 10 environment that runs from a USB stick. For example follow along here: https://superuser.com/questions/1518167/create-a-bootable-usb-of-windows-pe-on-linux
 To get the above USB stick to boot, I had to enable Windows UEFI secure boot in the BIOS. I also disabled Fast Boot. I'm not sure to what extent it mattered, but I also used gparted to rename the label on the USB drive to a short string
 Once I got the above booting, I installed the Intel ME driver from Asus website. Then I ran the Windows firmware updater available on Asus update
  
Having done the above I could update the BIOS from within the BIOS.
 There's a lot of stuff on google about getting getting Windows to boot from a USB drive on a modern UEFI system, that no longer supports legacy boot options. The combination of step 1 and step 2 worked. Took a couple of hours to figure out so I wanted to share.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It is, it seems, a week of Python Package Index (PyPI) news.  On the PyPI blog, Director of Infrastructure at the Python Software Foundation (PSF), Ee Durbin, has posted an admirably detailed description of the organization's response to three subpoenas it received for PyPI user information in March and April.  The requests for information were quite broad and the PSF did produce the requested material (to the extent possible), which involved five PyPI user accounts, under the advice of counsel. 

PyPI and the PSF are committed to the freedom, security, and privacy of our users.

This process has offered time to revisit our current data and privacy standards, which are minimal, to ensure they take into account the varied interests of the Python community. Though we collect very little personal data from PyPI users, any unnecessarily held data are still subject to these kinds of requests in addition to the baseline risk of data compromise via malice or operator error.

As a result we are currently developing new data retention and disclosure policies. These policies will relate to our procedures for future government data requests, how and for what duration we store personally identifiable information such as user access records, and policies that make these explicit for our users and community.


The post goes on to detail exactly which fields in the database tables were used to fulfill the request (without identifying the targets, naturally).  Meanwhile, another statement in the post leaves open the possibility that further subpoenas have been received since that time:

We have waited for the string of subpoenas to subside, though we were committed from the beginning to write and publish this post as a matter of transparency, and as allowed by the lack of a non-disclosure order associated with the subpoenas received in March and April 2023.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[OpenAI 呼吁像监管原子能一样监管超级智能

OpenAI 呼吁设立监管超级智能的国际机构，“我们最终可能需要类似于国际原子能机构的东西来进行超级智能方面的努力；任何超过一定能力（或计算等资源）门槛的努力都需要接受国际权威机构的检查，要求进行审计，测试是否符合安全标准，对部署程度和安全级别进行限制等等”。他们认为，“这样一个机构应专注于减少存在的风险，而不是那些应该留给各个国家的问题，例如定义人工智能应该被允许说什么。”


消息来源：OpenAI



老王点评：作为站在超级人工智能最前沿的公司，他们一定是意识到失控的人工智能有多可怕才提出这样的倡议。希望不要等到第一颗 AI “核弹” 爆炸后才去想办法监管吧。至于这样的倡议中，有没有其它附带的目的，那是另外一件事。




Windows 11 将原生支持 tar、7-zip、rar、gz 等压缩格式

微软称，“已经增加了对其他存档格式的原生支持，包括 tar、7-zip、rar、gz 和许多其他使用 libarchive 开源项目的格式”。你将不再需要安装第三方应用程序来访问这些文件。这些支持计划在本周晚些时候推出。


消息来源：The Verge



老王点评：Windows 用户等了几十年，然而，现在人们对压缩文件的需求，已经不是当年那小水管网络的时代了。所以，微软现在推出算是“亡羊补牢”呢，还是多此一举？




微软为 Windows 11 提供 AI “个人助理”

微软宣布为 Windows 11 增加一个 Copilot 人工智能助手。与在 Edge、Office 应用甚至 GitHub 中看到的 Copilot 侧边栏一样，Windows Copilot 将直接集成到 Windows 11 中，并可在所有应用和程序中从任务栏打开和使用。它可以总结你在应用程序中查看的内容，改写它，甚至解释它。它看起来与必应聊天中的对话框非常相似，所以你可以问它一般的问题和你通常可能会问搜索引擎的事情。


消息来源：The Verge



老王点评：真是不能给微软机会，以抓住 AI 的机会，立刻就全面转身了。相比之下，谷歌、苹果、亚马逊等在这次新的变化浪潮中就显得有点手忙脚乱，应接不暇。


回音


昨天报道了在中国的桌面搜索市场上，必应超过了百度的份额多达 10 个百分点。StatCounter 表示 统计数据异常，他们正在调查。我认为，显然这和他们的样本偏差有关。]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[不可变性是一种时下流行的概念。看看有哪些适合你的不可变 Linux 发行版。


每个发行版都是根据一系列目的而定制的。一些配置适用于 旧计算机，一些旨在提供 优质的用户体验，而一些则专注于安全性。

几年前，不可变发行版不是用户想要的。但是，最近越来越多的项目正在将不可变性作为 Linux 发行版的核心特征。

为什么会这样？有哪些可供选择？在你查看此列表之前，让我简要地向你介绍不可变性的更多内容：

什么是不可变 Linux 发行版？

不可变发行版确保操作系统的核心保持不变。对于不可变发行版来说，根文件系统保持为只读状态使得它可以在多个实例中保持相同。当然，如果你希望更改某些内容，则仍可以进行更改。但默认情况下该能力会被禁用。

它有什么用处？

传统上，不可变发行版存在的目的是为了方便测试和基于容器的软件开发。此外，不可变性为你的操作系统提供了更好的安全性和可靠的更新。

早期，这种特性的关注点主要集中在针对专业人士和开发人员的发行版上。现在，它开始应用于日常桌面用户。


📋 以下列表并没有按照任何特定的排名顺序列出，并且某些发行版仍处于早期开发阶段。


1、carbonOS



在写这篇文章时，carbonOS 是一款仍未推出的独立 Linux 发行版。它专注于提供强大的技术和流畅的用户体验。

它采用 Flatpak 优先和容器优先的方法。carbonOS 还旨在提供安全的系统更新，并提供一些不是所有原子发行版都具备的功能，如经过验证的启动。

除了其独特的特点外，它还希望专注于为用户提供出色的 GNOME 桌面体验。

2、Fedora Silverblue



Silverblue 是具有不可变性的 Fedora Workstation 的变种，是最受欢迎的不可变发行版之一。

        <link href="https://www.williamlong.info/archives/7175.html"/>
        <updated>2023-05-24T09:20:29.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[近来，B站音乐区up主掀起了一波AI翻唱团建热潮。“AI孙燕姿”在一众歌手中杀出重围，成为新晋顶流，已经拥有超过1000首翻唱作品，数量远远超出孙燕姿本尊出道23年的作品总和，“AI孙燕姿”翻唱的《下雨天》《半岛铁盒》等作品更是取得了突破百万的播放量。


5月22日深夜，歌手孙燕姿在网站上发布了《我的AI》一文，首度回应了自己对AI技术的看法。


她谈及，人们一直坚信思想或观点的形成是机器无法复制的任务，因为这超出了它能力范围，但现在它却赫然耸现并将威胁到成千上万个由人类创造的工作，比如法律、医学、会计等行业，以及目前正在谈论的唱歌。


因此在她看来，这项新技术将能够为每个人提供他们所需要的一切，无论是独立的、扭曲的还是疯狂的，都可能会有一种专门为你创作的独特内容。“你并不特别，你已经是可预测的，而且不幸的是，你也是可塑的。”


面对来势汹汹的AI技术，孙燕姿形容自己就像一个吃着爆米花、坐在电影院最好的位子上的人。“在这无边无际的存在之海中，凡事皆有可能，凡事皆无所谓，我认为思想纯净、做自己，已然足够。”


该回应也冲上热搜，引起网友热议。


以下为孙燕姿回应全文：



我的AI


当我正在为自己日渐凸起的肚子和孩子们的日常琐事感到绝望时，Al孙燕姿粉墨登场，于是我不禁想写点什么。


我的粉丝们已正式改换门庭，接受我就是一名冷门歌手的事实，而我的AI角色成为了目前的顶流。我想说的是，你跟一个每几分钟就推出一张新专辑的人还有什么好争的。


无论是ChatGPT还是Al或者你想叫它什么名字，这个“东西”现在能够通过处理海量的信息，同时以最连贯的方式拼接组合手头的任务，来模仿或创造出独特而复杂的内容。等一下，人类不就是这样做的吗？之前我们一直坚信，思想或观点的形成是机器无法复制的任务，这超出了它们的能力范围，但现在它却赫然耸现并将威胁到成千上万个由人类创造的工作，比如法律、医学、会计等行业，以及目前我们正在谈论的，唱歌。


你可能会反对，说我还是能分辨出区别的，它没有情绪，没有音调和呼吸(或任何你能想到的术语)的变化。很抱歉，我怀疑这只是一个非常短期内的回应。


讽刺的是，人类无法超越它已指日可待。没有人可以接触到如此大量的信息并做出恰当的抉择或犯下恰当的错误(OK，也许我领先一步了)。这种新技术将能够大量炮制每个人所需的一切。无论你多么小众、多么反常或者精神多么错乱，都可能有专门为你创建的独特内容。你并不特别，你已经是可预测的，而且不幸你也是可定制的。


此刻，我觉得自己就像一个在吃爆米花、坐在电影院最好的位置上的人。(顺便说一句:当前情况下，很可能没有任何技术能预测出作为我本人是什么感受，直到这篇文章出现在网络上)。就像在看那部改变了我们很多人生活的电影《瞬息全宇宙》，只不过在这种情况下，我不认为爱的理念可以挽救局面。


在这无边无际的存在之海中，凡事皆有可能，凡事皆无所谓，我认为思想纯净、做自己，已然足够。


就写到这里，祝你一切顺利。]]></summary>

在一般的文化想象中，冬宫先是俄罗斯帝国君主深居简出的住所，后成为各阶层各族人民反抗帝国压迫的革命舞台；而它因收藏有属于全人类的文化遗产，位列世界四大博物馆。这样的描述当然是符合事实的——作为君主的居所，冬宫是专制制度的象征，因此在革命年代对冬宫的占领自然也具备独一无二的符号价值。在帝国终结后，藏品转而使得冬宫肩负起一种公共的、世界主义的文化任务。然而，这三重身份之间的转换并不是骤然发生的，而是逐渐形成于俄国君主制和现代化的历史中。近日出版的《到冬宫去》一书正讲述了这一复杂的政治、经济和文化进程。
《到冬宫去》的作者苏珊·麦卡弗里（Susan McCaffrey）是北卡罗来纳大学威尔明顿分校历史系的教授，1983年于杜克大学取得博士学位，主要研究对象为俄罗斯帝国史，特别是国家与社会的关系。除了这次引进的这本，她还出版过一本关于沙俄时代工业化的专著——《沙俄工业化的政治》（The Politics of Industrialization in Tsarist Russia）。《到冬宫去》是一部关于冬宫文化功能之历史变迁的书，中文图书市场关于俄罗斯书籍虽然不少，但像这样同时做到史料翔实、以小见大、轻松易读的并不多见。

《沙俄工业化的政治》

到冬宫去，是一个历史进程。从散落于欧亚大陆的斯拉夫部族，到公元988年罗斯受洗，再逐渐发展为一个以莫斯科为中心的国家，罗斯-俄罗斯在其早期阶段并未将成为欧洲作为自身的文明目标。直到十七世纪下半叶，随着俄罗斯与欧洲文化更深度的往来，随着俄罗斯向东南西北四个方向的全面扩张，在政治、经济、文化、军事上与欧洲竞争，成为一个欧式的殖民帝国才提上日程。因此，彼得大帝将帝都迁到芬兰湾…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[DHCP 是 “动态主机配置协议Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol” 的首字母缩写词，它是一种网络协议，可自动为计算机网络中的客户端系统分配 IP 地址。它从 DHCP 池或在其配置中指定的 IP 地址范围分配客户端。虽然你可以手动为客户端系统分配静态 IP，但 DHCP 服务器简化了这一过程，并为网络上的客户端系统动态分配 IP 地址。

在本文中，我们将演示如何在 RHEL 9 / Rocky Linux 9 上安装和配置 DHCP 服务器。

先决条件


预装 RHEL 9 或 Rocky Linux 9

具有 sudo 管理权限的普通用户

本地配置的 YUM/DNF 仓库或 RHEL 9 的 Red Hat 订阅

互联网连接


事不宜迟，让我们进入 DHCP 服务器安装步骤。

1、在 RHEL 9 / Rocky Linux 9 上配置静态 IP 地址

开始时，必须在 RHEL 或 Rocky Linux 系统上设置静态 IP 地址。有多种方法可以执行此操作，但最简单和最直观的方法是使用 nmtui 或 nmcli 实用程序。

要确认你的 Linux 系统的 IP 地址，请运行以下 ip 命令：

$ ip a




2、安装和配置 DHCP 服务器

配置静态 IP 后，下一步就是安装 DHCP 服务器。RHEL 9 或 Rocky Linux 9 仓库 (BaseOS) 默认提供 dhcp-server 包，你可以如图所示安装它：

$ sudo dnf install dhcp-server -y




安装 dhcp 服务器后，我们需要进一步并配置设置。因此，打开 DHCP 配置文件：

$ sudo vi /etc/dhcp/dhcpd.conf

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I recently finally got around to messing with Linux since taking a class on it for my degree, and let me tell you it was like crack. I first went with Arch because honestly I wasn't planning to switch over from windows and just wanted to poke around, and I had an absolute blast just trying to get things to work, researching things, and learning how to do everything in a terminal. It really deepened my knowledge of how computers work, especially when I ran into issues with drivers and display managers. As I learned new things or had a "oh THATS how I could have done that better" moment, I'd just completely reinstall Arch. I know I could have easily fixed it, but at the time I wasn't fully aware of exactly how what I was changing affected the system and starting on a clean slate and doing things right just felt better. I probably reinstalled Arch like 6 times, each time getting closer and closer to a usable experience. Man it was so fun. I'm the type of guy who LOVES setting up new devices for whatever reason, maybe its an ADHD thing, and installing Arch was that but on steroids. Although I eventually ditched it for Mint because I missed the polish of all the tiny things windows had that would probably take me weeks to figure out and would irk me enough to go back. Anyway thank you for coming to my Ted talk, just wanted to share my first experience with Linux

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I own a pretty modest notebook, 8gb ram, i3 7th gen, no sdd. It does have a full hd screen, which is nice. Anyway, I dual boot windows 11 and Linux Mint Cinnamon. 
 The thing is, I'm a casual gamer and to be honest there's only two games I actually still feel like playing, Minecraft and Skyrim. The latter works fine (or used to at least) on Windows, plus it is heavily modded so I have no real reason to change anything. 
 I play Minecraft more however, and it has been getting worse and worse performance, as Windows 11 itself has, at least on this machine. After the latest OS updates this year, it got to a point that Minecraft will frequently freeze and stop responding for a full minute. Performance is just terrible, even with everything set to fast, v-synch off, etc.
 In short, after years having Linux as second option, I decided to use Mint as my main OS and one of the things I'd like to do is move my Minecraft playing there. Which I did and... it's just so much better. No stuttering, no lagging, good fps, best quality settings on, everything.
 So my point with this story is: why such a difference on the same hardware?? Is Windows that bad or is Linux really that efficient with system resources? I know windows has a lot of bloat, but how on earth can it mismanage things so bad?

a tool called Snagboot that is intended to help with the recovery of
bricked embedded systems.


	Thankfully, most embedded platforms almost always include some form

	this functionality to offer quick recovery and reflashing via USB,
	such as STM32CubeProgrammer, SAM-BA or UUU. However, these tools
	are all vendor-specific, which means that developers working on
	various kinds of platforms have to switch between different tools
	and learn how to use each one.

	To address this issue, Bootlin is happy to release today a new

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[使用一个简单的计数程序比较古老的 C 语言和现代的 Go 语言。


Go 是一种现代编程语言，它很大程度上源自于 C 编程语言。因此，对于写 C 程序的程序员来说，Go 应该会感觉很熟悉。Go 让编写新程序变得容易，同时让 C 程序员感觉熟悉，但避免了 C 编程语言的许多常见陷阱。

本文比较了一个简单的 C 和 Go 程序，该程序将数字从一相加到十。由于这个程序只使用了小的数值，所以结果不会变得太大，因此只使用了普通的整数变量。像这样的循环在编程中非常常见，所以这个简单的程序很容易比较 C 和 Go。

如何在 C 中执行循环

C 语言中最基本的循环是 for 循环，它允许你对一组值进行迭代。for 循环的基本语法是：

for (起始条件 ; 结束条件 ; 每次迭代后执行的操作) { 循环内要执行的内容 ; }


你可以编写一个 for 循环，以打印从 1 到 10 的数字，将起始条件设置为 count = 1，将结束条件设置为 count <= 10。这样就以 count 变量等于 1 时开始循环。结束条件意味着只要 count 变量小于或等于 10 ，循环就会继续。

每次迭代之后，你使用 count = count + 1 将 count 变量的值增加 1。在循环内部，你可以使用 printf 打印 count 变量的值：

for (count = 1; count <= 10; count = count + 1) {
  printf("%d\n", count);
}


C 程序中常见的惯例是 ++，它表示 “将某个值加一”。如果你写 count++，那就相当于 count = count + 1。大多数 C 程序员会使用 count++ 来编写 for 循环中每次迭代后要执行的操作，像这样：

for (count …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[5月23日消息，据报道，微软联合创始人比尔·盖茨日前作出一项预测。他认为，未来顶级的AI公司将会开发出一种全新的“个人数字助理”，能够帮助普通大众完成诸多具体工作，这将带来颠覆性变化。


盖茨表示，个人数字助理将拥有优秀的功能，将会改变普通人的生活工作习惯，不论哪一家公司赢得了AI数字助理的竞争，都将是一个重大历史事件。未来，人们不用再去亲自访问谷歌等网页搜索引擎，不用去办公软件站点，也无需访问亚马逊网站亲自购物。


美东时间周一，美国高盛集团和投资机构“SV天使”在加州旧金山举办了一场有关AI主题的大会，盖茨上台发言，并做出了这一预测。


他表示，未来面世的AI助理能够理解普通大众的需求和生活习惯，比如可以阅读主人平时没有时间阅读的图书。


盖茨认为，未来开发出这种AI助理的厂商，可能是一家新创科技公司，也有可能是科技巨头，两者的概率五五开。


盖茨也提到了他创办的微软公司。他表示，如果微软没有加入开发AI助理，他将感到失望，但是一些AI新创公司也让他眼前一亮，比如Inflection.AI公司（该公司由谷歌旗下Deepmind的前任高管穆斯塔法·苏力曼联合创办）。


盖茨表示，这种强大的AI助理距离飞入寻常百姓家还有一定的距离。而在这种助理问世之前，AI公司的重点工作是把生成式AI技术（典型代表是OpenAI公司的对话撰稿工具ChatGPT）整合到现有的各种产品中。


当天，盖茨还提到了旗下慈善机构“比尔和梅琳达·盖茨基金会”有关医疗卫生的项目。他认为，AI技术也会加速医疗卫生领域的创新，有助于开发出更先进的药物。


在具体药品研发上，目前科学家对于人类大脑的内部工作机制尚未彻底了解。盖茨表示，人类正在接近于开发出治疗大脑疑难杂症的关键药物，其中包括老年痴呆症，不过这些新药物的临床试验需要大约十年的时间。


众所周知的是，生成式AI技术能够更加聪明的完成人类目前从事的一些复杂工作，比如撰写文稿。盖茨表示，这种技术将带来颠覆性的社会变革，影响到白领上班族的饭碗。而在未来，对于企业老板来说，模拟人类的机器人比人类工人更加便宜，这种技术将会冲击到蓝领工人的岗位。


盖茨还开玩笑称，在研发这种取代人类的机器人时，厂商需要确保它们不会患上老年痴呆症。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[在 Rust 系列的第四篇中，学习复合数据类型、数组和元组。


在上一篇文章中，你学习到了 Rust 中的 标量数据类型。它们是整型、浮点数、字符和布尔值。

在本文中，我们将会看看 Rust 编程语言中的复合数据类型。

Rust 中的复合数据类型是什么？

复合数据类型可以在一个变量中存储多个值。这些值可以是相同的标量数据类型，也可以是不同的标量数据类型。

Rust 编程语言中有两种这样的数据类型：


数组Array：存储相同类型的多个值。

元组Tuple：存储多个值，可以是相同的类型，也可以是不同的类型。


让我们了解一下它们吧！

Rust 中的数组

Rust 编程语言中的数组具有以下特性：


每一个元素都必须是相同的类型

数组有一个固定的长度

数组存储在堆栈中，即其中存储的数据可以被 迅速 访问


创建数组的语法如下：

// 无类型声明
let variable_name = [element1, element2, ..., elementn];

// 有类型声明
let variable_name: [data_type; array_length] = [element1, element2, ..., elementn];


数组中的元素是在方括号中声明的。要访问数组的元素，需要在方括号中指定要访问的索引。

来让我们看一个例子来更好地理解这个。

fn main() {
    // 无类型声明
    let greeting = ['H', 'e', 'l', 'l', 'o', ' ', 'w', 'o', 'r', 'l', 'd', '!'];

    // 有类型声明
    let pi: [i32; 10] = [1, 4, 1, 5, 9, 2…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[今年是周一良先生诞辰一百一十周年。年初，笔者曾偶得周越然编《原文天方夜谭（附汉文释义）》（商务印书馆1929年版）一本，系周一良先生少时（十六岁）所读。近些年周氏藏书在坊间大批散出，前人已多有评述，本无需赘言。然此册之可贵处，在于其所附题记颇能见出近代中国“版权观”的一种独特面向，兹转录于下：

周一良购书题记

周一良 购自上海 十八年六月二日
骆驼补充读本。
太单简，且有趣之故事多未选入，读family reading本及奚若译冷氏本后，此册直不堪阅矣。题名原文，未审何译本，岂其最浅易，专为儿童读者耶？此类名著前须加解题及版本，初学始感兴味，商务如此不负责任地擅自翻版、移植，实无聊之至。
此书虽云原文，想是英译本中最简者，较予现所读本，不可以道计。
所谓“骆驼”，当指《天方夜谭》中的“骆驼”篇。由此推知，此书应为周先生学习“骆驼”一篇时所选择的“补充读本”。周一良先生自幼在家中就学，未曾踏入中、小学一步。据其晚年回忆，“在家塾读古书以外，我从十四岁以后开始了外文的学习，首先是日文”，“以后，又从英国中学的英语老师学了英文”。作为民国时期最常见的英文学习读物之一，《天方夜谭》被周一良先生的家塾师选作“家庭读物”（family reading）并不稀奇。而真正让人意外的，是少年周一良对此读本极为严厉的批评态度。
针对此原文注释本，周一良先生的第一个不满在于其选目过狭，“太单简，且有趣之故事多未选入，读family reading本及奚若译冷氏本后，此册直不堪阅矣”。查1906年奚若译冷氏（Edward Lane）本选有故事五十篇；相较之下，周越然注释本仅选故事十三篇，确有“太单简”之嫌。而周一良先生更深层次的不满，则是此读本在版本方面的缺陷。“此类名著前须加解题及版本，初学始感兴味”，然此书“题名原文，未审何译本，岂其最浅易，专为儿童读者耶？”当时自觉已非“儿童读者”的“少…]]></summary>

读了孙超的新著《民初上海小说界研究（1912-1923）》，让我想起一件往事，大约是2013年，我们华东师范大学主办的第二届“思勉原创奖”揭晓。李泽厚先生的《哲学纲要》、阎步克先生的《品位与职位——秦汉魏晋南北朝官阶制度研究》、张涌泉先生的《汉语俗字研究》以及罗宗强先生的《隋唐五代文学思想史》获原创奖，范伯群先生的《中国现代通俗文学史》获原创提名奖。思勉原创奖是一个民间奖项，但在当下人文学术领域颇为研究者所看重，这种看重除了评选规范，获奖作品优秀等之外，其重原创、重影响的评选标准是其中最为重要的因素。当时有位朋友问我，为什么《中国现代通俗文学史》能获原创提名奖？为现代通俗文学撰“史”，其“原创性”表现在哪里？记得当时我是这样回答的：从研究史角度言之，二十世纪是最重通俗文学的一个世纪，古代通俗小说、戏曲文学乃至说唱文学都获得了前所未有的重视，甚至成为古代文学研究之“显学”。而就现代文学的创作和研究来看，现代通俗文学却被无限地“边缘化”，如传统章回体小说曾经是古代通俗小说最为重要的文体，如今则“隐退”到小说主流之外，蛰伏于“言情”“武侠”等领域，且在“雅俗”的大框架下充任着不入流品的“通俗小说”角色。故现代通俗文学虽创作繁盛，读者众多，但始终不受重视，更遑论为其著史。此为“悖论”，却是实情。范伯群先生倾力为现代通俗文学“正名”，为其著史，当然是“原创”。我引出这一段“往事”无非是想说明，孙超的新著正是在这种“原创”的影响之下、在现代通俗文学已获“新生”的前提之下所作出的一项亦具备“原创”意味的研究工作，值得重视。

《小说大观》

《民初上海小说界研究（1912-1923）》选题是有原创价值的。对于现代通俗文学的研究，经过范伯群先生、黄霖先生、陈平原先生和袁进先生等的拓荒和推进，取得了不少研究成绩，在观…]]></summary>

Blotter is a proof of concept I hacked together that does a bit of audio recognition combined with a few generative AI models (both text and img) to create visuals that are relevant to the song.
The video stream is generated in real time at 24fps - you can try it yourself by requesting visuals in the Twitch chat using the "!v" command!
Right now it's mostly a fun hack project, but I am tinkering with new model architectures for higher fidelity video as well as an interactive tool so people can make videos with their own audio files.
I'd love to hear any feedback or suggestions, thanks!

一百多年来各种不同层面的译介，深刻改变了中国思想的语境。西方经典的格义和诠释，极大拓展了汉语表达的疆界。今天，试图回到纯净的中国传统哲学的语境，恐怕只是一种无助的乡愁。当代汉语的丰富性，蕴涵着新的哲学可能。如何在延续中国固有哲学的精神的基础上，面对当代世界展开新的思考，是中国哲学研究应该面对的问题。系列讨论“当代中国哲学五人谈”围绕当代中国哲学的问题、形态、语言等论域中的主题，在阐发和对话中开启新的思想可能。
在中国哲学的历史展开中，庄子始终是持恒的鼓舞者。无论什么时代，他的思想和文章总能激发思辨、想象和重新阐发的愿望。近年来庄子研究著作的集中出现，既反映了当代中国思想创造的跃动，也提示出进一步深入对话和讨论的必要。2023年3月11日，“当代中国哲学五人谈·第四季”围绕陈少明教授的《梦觉之间：〈庄子〉思辨录》（2021）和杨立华教授的《庄子哲学研究》（2020）这两部写作和思想风格迥异的作品，邀请北京师范大学哲学学院刘笑敢教授、北京大学哲学系杨立华教授、复旦大学哲学学院丁耘教授、北京大学哲学系王颂教授、清华大学哲学系陈壁生教授展开多视野多角度的讨论和交锋。对谈由北京大学哲学系程乐松教授主持。
本季五人谈由生活·读书·新知三联书店编辑王晨晨、蔡雪晴、苏诗毅、钟韵，以及澎湃新闻记者丁雄飞共同整理，经作者审定，分两部分刊发。

《梦觉之间：〈庄子〉思辨录》，陈少明著，生活·读书·新知三联书店，2021年2月出版，240页，52.00元


《庄子哲学研究》，杨立华著，北京大学出版社，2020年9月出版，328页，79.00元

程乐松：庄子的时代和时代的庄子
立华老师在三个意义上一直是非常自觉的。第一，他一直认为面对经典性文本的思想阐述一定需要高度的仪式感和严肃的态度，从他的表述中我们也可以看到这种严肃感和对经典诠释…]]></summary>

For example, we know that the pain of building new API integrations scales with the level of fragmentation and number of competing "standards". In the current meta, we see this pain with a lot of AI startups who invariably need to connect to their customers data, but have to support 50+ integrations before they even scale to 50+ customers.
This is the process for an AI startup to add a new integration for a customer:
- Pore over the API docs for each source application and write a connector for each
- Play email tag to find the right stakeholders and get them to share sensitive API keys, or give them an OAuth app. It can take 6+ week…]]></summary>
