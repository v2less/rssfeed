        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Im working on a tool that makes it easier for people to switch from using "snap" packages to "Flatpak" packages on their computer. This tool will do the following:
  
Identify what "snap" apps are currently installed on their computer.
 Automatically download the corresponding "Flatpak" version of those apps.
 Remove the "snap" version from their system.
  
To make this tool work better, I need a list of "snap" apps that also have "Flatpak" versions available. I started with a list from a project called "unsnap," but it's a bit outdated now, so I'm looking for a more updated and comprehensive list.
 If you know of any recent and complete lists of "snap" apps with their "Flatpak" alternatives, I would really appreciate your help. This way, more people can use the tool to switch to "Flatpak" packages easily, even for a larger variety of apps. Thanks!
 Here Is the repo and the link to google forms to input the data.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi guys,
 so I just switched from Windows to Linux and I decided to use Fedora 38 as my first system.
 I installed the OS, updates, upgrades, etc...
 The nvidia driver is installed (latest version I believe so), but the system feels very slow for some reason. Also the steam is getting bug reloading the store page (App installed in the software center). Also got a bug where I was watching a friend stream on discord and it was having a lot of stuttering (had to switch to discord app and worked just fine). I think my pc specs wouldn't do this since never happened on windows. In case the problem is really the system I will maybe switch to Linux Mint since was the 1st option I had in mind due to friendly user.
 Someone using Fedora 38 and having the same issue or already had and was able to resolve?
 Nvidia version: 535.54.03
 NVML Version: 12.535.54.03

 Thanks a lot!

I fell in love with superb performance but the sweetest bit for me was how streamlined my workflow became using SSH for everything, Remmina etc.
 How easy would it be to move to Debian instead as my daily driver workstation? I love Ubuntu but snaps are hideous and I feel I should really go with a truly fully Open Source distro, especially after watching "Learn Linux TV"'s latest YouTube video. Currently on Ubuntu 22.04.

 I'm looking for offline app for mind maps, thought maps with android app but that's not a must. I have installed XMind and I don't know yet if it's good to invest my time in it. Will be there a need for net access for some essential function? Maybe there are some other great apps of that kind that you use.

 There are many MANY reasons why i would like to NOT use nvidia.. but if I have to... then how does it perform now...
 I have heard it has gotten better with wayland, but by how much ?... how is it compared to AMD today ?
 is it any good, will it get better ?

dawn of CentOS:


	In 2009, the main project admin for CentOS went radio

One thing i noticed is when i boot linux it just open grub directly then boot my os, there is no logo of the hardware manufacturer in my case asus, but when i boot windows there is a logo of asus first then after a while it start booting windows, why is this? My theory is windows is the one that displaying the manufacturer logo to create the illusion of its the hardware loading up because if it was all windows logo it will make it look so slow. And the hardware manufacturer gets branding in returns. I know this is such a noob assumption but am really curious

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As a person who has used both Windows, Mac and Linux, I have come to the conclusion that this is the time for me and others to switch to Linux. I am in control of what I do; in Linux the majority of distros have no ads, and no "reccomended settings" that Microsoft tries to get you to use to sell more personal info. Trying to install Windows 11 got my computer in a boot loop and had to take out a battery underneath my gpu (I am very inexperienced with the physical side of computers) so I have given up hope for Windows. I will still have a Windows 10 VM for special windows apps that don't work with Wine - but Linux is getting a lot more recognition than it had in the past.

 Maybe your own package manager? Your own provisioning system? Your own desktop environment?
 The question is purely philosophical. I am not going to make another "cool Linux distribution". I am just interested in the opinion of the community.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've been using Linux on my desktop for about a year now and I am all in. I always knew Windows was junk but had no idea how bad it was until I tried an alternative. People I know are tired of me using any excuse to all over it. lol
  
 My career has stalled out a little bit this month and its time for me to rethink what I want to do with my life. I have over a decade of experience as a full stack web developer so I have a good understanding of the basics of programming. I've even maintained a few Linux web servers but didn't do anything special to configure them.
  
 Even in IT, everyone is convinced that you need to be big brained to have anything to do with Linux so there aren't tons of people out there that know how to use it. It makes me wonder what I would have to learn to pivot into being a system admin or something. I don't know. This whole thing is an idea that just popped into my head 10 min ago so I am still figuring things out. Any advice? Certifications or courses you would recommend? Is there a lot of remote work for a person that knows a lot about linux?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[libjpeg-turbo 3.0 发布，开发者表示无力继续

这个开源的 JPEG 图像编解码器每天有数十亿人通过浏览器、操作系统和图像查看器/编辑器使用，并且它是 ISO/ITU-T 的参考实现，经过了严格的审查。它的主要开发者 DRC 在 3.0 发布公告中说，这可能是功能开发的结束，很可能不会有 3.1 版本。DRC 表示，目前该项目只有每月约 8-10 小时的一般资金支持。而完成 3.0 测试版需要借用 2023 年所有预期的一般资金，而修复错误需要借用到 2024 年 9 月的所有资金，也就是说该项目未来 15 个月实际上将处于 “维护模式”。它的开发者 DRC 的大部分收入来自他的另外两个项目 VirtualGL 和 TurboVNC，而从 2010-2018 年，DRC 投入了相当于几十万美元的时间来开发 libjpeg-turbo 2.0，甚至导致负债时，不得不停止在该项目上投入。

老王点评：很多开源开发者花费了自己的时间金钱来贡献给开源，但是他们也需要钱来生活。不知道那些嫌弃别人白嫖他们的开源代码的人，是不是也白嫖过其它的上游项目呢？




Valve 拒绝发布带有人工智能生成内容的游戏

一位独立开发者在论坛上发帖说，Valve “不再愿意发布有人工智能生成内容的游戏”。他们提交的游戏有 “一些相当明显的 AI 生成的素材”。Valve 在给开发者回复中称，“我们不能发布开发者没有所有必要权利的游戏。目前，我们拒绝分发你的游戏，因为我们不清楚用于创建素材的底层人工智能技术是否对训练数据有足够的权利。”考虑到大多数人工智能工具不能真正声称对其所有的训练数据有合法权利（即使它们有，也可能不是对该数据的道德使用），这一政策的陈述基本上相当于对游戏中人工智能生成的资产的全面禁止。Valve 表示，他们的政策更多的是 “法律上的要求”，而不是对人工智能的任何特定立场，其审查过程“是对现行版权法和政策的反映，而不是我们意见的附加层。”

老王点评：这件事凸显了现有的版权法律无法适应人工智能的需要。究竟什么样的内容可以被人工智能刮取并生成内容，然后这些内容的版权归属于谁。如果要归属于原内容提供者，人工智能是否有可能、有意义地明确地指出来源？




谷歌将用网络上公开的所有信息训练人工智能

谷歌上周末更新了其隐私政策，明确表示该公司保留刮取你在网上发布的所有信息以建立其人工智能工具的权利。谷歌举例说，将“使用公开的信息来帮助训练谷歌的人工智能模型，并建立产品和功能，如谷歌翻译、Bard 和云人工智能功能”。以前，谷歌说这些数据将被用于 “语言模型”，而不是 “人工智能模型”，而旧政策只提到谷歌翻译，现在也包括 Bard 和云人工智能。

老王点评：和上一条对应，谷歌利用互联网“公开”的信息训练的人工智能，其输出的内容的版权如何界定？现在大家都黑不提白不提的就这样糊涂着，是想造成既成事实倒逼法律认可，还是需要更多的实践和探讨？]]></summary>

 As far as I have found out, the limiting factors for computational speed of this PC are low RAM capacity (i work with experimental datasets in python and OriginPro 2021,some datasets files can grow into 1-2gb-ish volume ) and HDD speed. 
 I can spare a little money for used 2*8gb ddr3 kit, but I don't really wanna buy new ssd. 
 I am quite pissed off on how strong lag can be produced by windows defender or telemetry when those instances are running. 
 So, I am planning to install archlinux (so my system would be free of useless bloat- and malware) on free partition of HDD in hope I would get smoother experience and a lot of other Linux advantages. Would be BTRFS a good pick for hdd or should I pick other file system? If I was installing Linux on ssd I would've picked F2FS.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[了解如何使用用于切换目录的一个基本但必不可少的 Linux 命令。


Linux 中的 cd 命令用于更改目录。cd 实际上是“更改目录change directories”的缩写。

这是你必须了解的 基本 Linux 命令之一。

使用 cd 命令非常简单：

cd path_to_directory


不可能比这更简单了，对吧。

然而，你应该理解它的路径部分，以便轻松地浏览 文件系统 而不会感到困惑。

这是绝对路径和相对路径的快速回顾：



如果你需要更多细节，我建议你阅读这篇文章：


Linux 上的绝对路径和相对路径有什么不同


让我们看一些使用 cd 命令的示例。

使用绝对路径更改目录

从视觉上看会更容易理解。看下图。



我当前的位置是我的主目录（/home/abhishek），我必须进入 scripts 目录中的 python 目录。

假设我想使用绝对路径。python 目录的绝对路径是 /home/abhishek/scripts/python。

cd /home/abhishek/scripts/python




使用相对路径更改目录

让我们举同样的例子，但这次我将采用相对路径。



我的主目录到 python 目录的相对路径是 scripts/python。让我们用这个：

cd scripts/python




进入上级目录

到目前为止，你一直在进入下级。如果你必须进入上级目录怎么办？

假设你位于 /home/abhishek/scripts/python 中，并且必须将目录添加到 scripts？



使用绝对路径始终是一种选择，但它相当冗长。相反，你可以使用特殊的目录符号 ..。双点 （..）表示父目录或上一级目录。单点（.）表示当前目录。

cd ..


这是一个例子：



你可以使用 .. 在 Linux 文件系统层次结构中向上移动路径。

假设我在上图中的 python 目录中，想要进入 code 目录。这是我能做的：

cd ../../code




进入主目录

如果你在所有这些目录切换中感到迷失并想回到主目录，有很多简单的快捷方式。

事实上，最简单的就是使用不带任何选项的 cd 命令。

cd


这将使你从文件系统上的任何位置返回主目录。

或者，你可以使用 ~ 符号，表示主目录。

cd ~




进入根目录

尽管你不会像前一个那样经常使用它，但了解一下仍然有好处。

如果你想返回文件系统开始的根目录，请使用以下命令：

cd /


这里不涉及“魔法”。当放在路径开头使用时，/ 表示根。不要将它与路径分隔符混淆。



切换回上一级目录

这是一个救命稻草，或者我应该说是“省时稻草”。当你深入目录结构，然后转到另一个目录，然后你觉得需要返回到以前的位置时，此快捷方式会有所帮助。

cd -


还不清楚吗？ 让我举个例子。

我位于 /etc/apt/sources.list.d。从这里，进入 /home/abhishek/scripts/python 来处理我的代码。然后我意识到我必须再次检查 /etc/apt/sources.list.d 目录中的某些内容。

通常的方法是这样做，这让我再次输入所有路径：



但聪明的方法是使用这个：



看吧，无需再次输入冗长的路径。如期工作！

🏋️ 练习时间

如果你想练习 cd 命令，这里有一些练习供你使用。


打开终端并进入 /var/log 目录。检查目录内容。你看到了什么？

现在，进入 /var 目录。这是一个上级目录。

从这里返回你的主目录。


这些内容足以让你熟悉 cd 命令。以下是你应该了解的其他一些重要命令。


每个 Ubuntu 用户都应该知道的 31 条 Linux 命令


如果你有疑问或建议，请告诉我。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[以下是为什么大多数黑客和渗透测试人员喜欢使用 Kali Linux 的几个原因。


Kali Linux 是一个基于 Debian “测试版” 的 Linux 操作系统，创建于近十年前。在过去几年里，它在黑客和网络安全专业人员中非常流行。随着对数字基础设施的越来越多的依赖和网络威胁的不断增长，网络安全对于普通用户和企业来说变得更加重要。

道德黑客和渗透测试人员在识别漏洞和加强系统安全方面发挥着重要作用。由于 Kali Linux 具备为安全测试和分析而量身定制的全面工具和功能，因此成为他们的首选操作系统。



概述

Kali Linux 由 Offensive Security（一家美国信息安全公司）维护，并得到社区中数千名贡献者的支持。它跟随 Debian 的 “测试版” 分支的发展，保持与最新软件包的同步，为黑客们提供了最新模块来进行工作。

此外，Kali Linux 支持多种架构，例如 x86、x86-64、armel 和 armhf，这有助于黑客在广泛的硬件范围内使用。

使用此发行版的最大优势之一是它适用于多个技术平台，你可以下载和使用。以下是其中一些平台：


32 位和 64 位的安装镜像（ISO）

预构建的虚拟机镜像

ARM 架构镜像

用于移动设备的安卓镜像

Docker 和 LXD 镜像

可在各个厂商提供的云中使用

只读的 LIVE ISO 镜像

可在 Windows 的 Linux 子系统（WSL）上使用


为何它备受青睐

强大的渗透测试工具

Kali Linux 提供了丰富的渗透测试工具，使黑客能够识别并利用漏洞。这些工具包括网络扫描器、密码破解器、无线攻击框架和 Web 应用程序评估工具。这个操作系统内置了如此之多的工具，极大地简化了黑客的工作流程，使他们能够有效专注于目标。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[中华书局本《谈艺录》118页引宋人《四六话》的名言，以论放翁云：“《四六话》论隶事，有‘伐山语、伐材语’之别；放翁诗中，美具难并，然亦不无蹈袭之嫌者。”意谓陆游多是“伐材”，“非拓境宇、启山林手也”。444页补订云：“不知东坡为用此事之伐山手，放翁以下皆只伐材。”498页语及用《寒食帖》事又云：“按晁冲之伐山，始取《寒食帖》入诗，南宋多继而伐材者。”“伐山、伐材”之别，见于王铚《四六话》卷上：“四六有伐山语，有伐材语。伐材语者，如已成之柱桷，略加绳削而已；伐山语者，则搜山（搜山一作披山）开荒，自我取之。伐材谓熟事也，伐山谓生事也。”（据《历代文话》本）简言之，凡是第一个用别人所从未用过的事，就是“伐山”；而用别人所已经用过的事，就是“伐材”。“伐山”优于“伐材”，是不必说的。文人作文如是，学者著书亦然。所以顾炎武另有一个著名的比喻，那就是其《与人书十》中说的：“今人纂辑之书，正如今人之铸钱。古人采铜于山，今人则买旧钱，名之曰废铜，以充铸而已。”拟喻虽有不同，精神却是相通的。乃至于学人征文考献，亦贵伐山的第一手材料，而轻转手的伐材之事。通人必须博览，但是“书囊无底”，所以就是通人，也免不了有时要“伐材”。我去年年底时，因为住在铜陵，手边无别的书可读，所以把三十年前读过的《谈艺录》，又重读了一过，因此而屡见博极群书的钱先生所引的书，也多有是从伐材而得的。钱先生的“伐材之事”，我以前在《钱边缀琐》中指过一些，但那是瞥记随举的，不及这次所获之多。故写为一篇，供给研究“钱学”及喜谈掌故的人参考。

钱先生于陈衍的著述，无疑是谙熟于胸的，《石语》记陈誉其云“世兄记老夫诗熟”，可为一证。这都不必多说。陈的《石遗室诗话》，在钱先生的《中文笔记》中，却并没有笔记，那可能是因为太熟之故，所以不复札之于纸了。《谈艺录》中则多次引及石遗，在近人中是少有的，但暗本《石遗室诗话》，而又不加注明的，也…]]></summary>

 I used to know how to create ipfilter rules, but can't quite remember off hand, although it wouldn't be hard to look it up.
 So is ipfilter still the default way to setup a firewall?
 Are they needed? Firewalls?
 I used to basically DENY everything on the 3 chains and then explicitly let through certain things like my browser, etc?
 Thanks

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello, so I was trying to build a custom wheel of Onnx Runtime and my computer completely crashed and rebooted on its own.
 During boot, it said something about hardware and then on another screen, something about (username) ttyl
 Weird but I thought nevermind, I'll do it again. On the second attempt, I updated/upgraded packages as usual and two words in the terminal caught my eye "initramsfs" and "grub". I remembered this because I had some issues booting into Linux in another computer.
 Regardless, I tried building the wheel again and once again, computer hard crashed/reboot. 
 I reset my bios settings but this time it booted straight into Windows. I never got the Grub screen.
 I booted into BIOS but it won't show my Linux boot option. Used the Boot Repair option in a live usb twice and Linux will still not show up in boot options.
 I also tried the fsck command on my root drive but it said it was mounted, even thought I used the sudo umount command before that.
 Can someone tell me why building an image may have crashed my computer and why I can't boot into Linux?
 Edit 2: Booted in with a live usb again and ran sudo fack /dev/sda2 and it returned clean, 1901093/16416768 files, 29049565, 65636608 blocks

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Yo, I threw together a little "plugin" for zsh/bash (and probably any POSIX-compatible shell) that helps work with multiple git repositories that have different "main" branch names – master and main obviously.
 Recently, various projects have been using both main and master as the name of the "main" branch in the project. This adds a bit of mess in my UX.
 This "plugin" keeps track of the status of some git subcommands that require a branch name (switch, checkout, merge, rebase, log are now supported).
 If you mistype the branch name, this tool will try to correct the command.
 For example: You type git switch main, but the main branch does not exist in the current repo – BranchFixer will correct the branch name to master.
 Thus, git switch master will be executed instead of git switch main.
 If it's useful to anyone, use it :)

 P.S. PRs and ideas for improvements are welcome

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[On my linux server i have all my partitions (all but /boot) encrypted via LUKS. I have also installed dropbear to remotely unlock the disk after reboot via SSH.
 Sometimes the power goes out and my server will reboot after getting power again but stops booting as the decryption password will be needed.
 I want to automate the process by providing the server with the decryption password over network. First i wrote a script which tries to unlock the system remotely every couple of minutes via cron. This works but is not a very good solution.
 I want a solution where the server pulls the password from another server automatically. 
 How would i go about writing an initramfs script which tries to access another server, pull the password from there and unlock itself via that password?
 Or does it make sense to try to alter the dropbear initramfs files so that it pulls the password from another server. https://ubuntu.pkgs.org/22.04/ubuntu-universe-amd64/dropbear-initramfs_2020.81-5_all.deb.html 
 I can not use a UPS and i do not want to save the password in plaintext on the machine itself for obvious reasons.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There are existing HN job aggregators, but I thought we could take it a step further.
Inspired by an insightful comment on a previous thread (https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36163021), I built a tool that aggregates job postings and intelligently categorizes them based on user-specific preferences:
* Country and remote work preferences
* Employer type (e.g., startup, corporation, government)
* Industry
* Technologies used
* Role type (developer, architect, product owner, etc.)
* Salary range (where available)
One of the superpowers of LLMs is reformatting information from any format X to any other format Y.
We leverage this to map all the unstructured job postings into the same unified structure. The new GPT functions feature and the extended context windows are really helpful for this.
Instead of having to build a custom NER pipeline, it works very well with GPT out-of-the box.
One challenge is keeping the filters consistent and merging of duplicates. Embeddings help with that.
What's next:
* Integrate additional sources. We can generate web scrapers and data processing steps on the fly that extract and transform data into the same structure.
* Add location distance filters.
* Expand beyond jobs to monitor personalized data like events or real estate. Imagine using AI to rate local events from multiple sources based on your preferences, considering factors like your interests and distance from home.
* Smaller improvements based on your feedback :)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Snap 设计者开发用 Flatpak 替换 Snap 的脚本

已经离开 Canonical 公司的 Alan Pope 是 Snap 软件包格式的共同开发者。Flatpak 和 Snap 都是一种沙盒容器式的软件包格式，旨在提供一种独立于发行版的打包格式，解决包依赖问题，能在不导致依赖地狱的情况下在同一个系统上安装同一个程序的多个版本。Flatpak 是由红帽主导推出的。相比 Snap 只能使用 Canonical 私有的软件包商店，Flatpak 可以支持多个软件仓库。最新的 Ubuntu 23.04 中默认移除了 Flatpak 格式的支持。Alan Pope 开发了一个名为 unsnap 的脚本，如果一个 Snap 软件包存在对应的 Flatpak 包，那么它将会自动用 Flatpak 包替换 Snap 包。


消息来源：Linux 杂志



老王点评：这个脚本并不复杂，作者也坦诚并不成熟。有趣是，作为 Snap 包格式的共同作者之一，他推出这样的脚本。




红帽为 RHEL 7 再增加四年的支持

红帽企业 Linux 7（RHEL 7）发布于 2014 年。所有 RHEL 的大版本都遵循标准的十年生命周期，前五年是全面支持，后五年是维护支持。此后，RHEL 进入延长生命周期阶段，红帽为其提供延长生命周期支持。也就是说，从 2024 年 7 月 1 日开始，红帽将为有需要的客户提供 4 年的 RHEL 7 延长支持服务。顺便提一句，RHEL 7 的下一个版本，RHEL 8 及其下游的 CentOS 8 已经在 2021 年 结束支持，原因大家都知道，是为了给 CentOS Stream 让路。


消息来源：红帽



老王点评：看来当时没有及时迁移到 RHEL 8/CentOS 8 的很多人仍然坚守在 7 上。




首个完全由人工智能生成的药物进入临床试验

一家总部位于香港的生物技术初创公司利用人工智能创造了一种治疗特发性肺纤维化的药物。这种导致肺部结疤的慢性疾病，如果不加以治疗，可在 2 至 5 年内导致死亡。该公司称，“这是第一个进入人体临床试验的完全生成型人工智能药物，特别是与病人进行的第二阶段试验。……该药物是第一个既有人工智能发现的新目标，又有人工智能生成的新设计的药物”。该药物目前已经在中国开展为期 12 周的随机、双盲、安慰剂对照试验。


消息来源：CNBC



老王点评：昨天我们报道了由人工智能设计的芯片，今天看到了设计的药物。以后，我们会看到越来越多由人工智能发现、设计和制造的制品。]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Clipboard 是一个有用的开源工具，具有许多可提高你的工作效率的功能。




想要一个新的智能剪贴板管理器吗？ 🤔

这就是 Clipboard 项目 背后的人们对其剪贴板管理器的看法。他们称之为“第二大脑”，可以随时随地记住任何事情。

你认为呢？ 让我们看一下：

Clipboard：概述 ⭐



Clipboard 主要用古老的 C++ 编程语言编写，提供了许多功能，例如复制/粘贴文本、文件、目录、二进制数据、无限剪贴板等等！

此外，它 与主要的 GUI 剪贴板系统无缝集成 并支持西班牙语、葡萄牙语和土耳其语等语言。

让我向你展示它是如何工作的。


📋 由于这是一个基于终端的应用，因此你必须使用各种命令来操作 Clipboard。


因此，你要做的第一件事是使用以下命令复制文件的内容：

cb copy 'filename'




然后进行粘贴，你可以使用以下命令：

cb paste




要加载所有剪贴板，你可以使用以下命令：

cb show




最后，最吸引我们注意的功能是最近添加的 无限剪贴板历史记录 功能。

你可以使用此命令访问完整的剪贴板历史记录：

cb hs




这个剪贴板应该会 吸引那些更喜欢使用基于终端的应用 而不是基于 GUI 的应用的用户。它提供了非常简单的用户体验以及所有合适的工具。

不要忘了，它包含的功能比我讨论的更多，其中包括：


制作脚本来自动化你的工作流程

能够粘贴你拥有的每种类型的数据，包括二进制数据


那些喜欢图形界面的应用的人可以选择 Pano 剪贴板管理器。它是一个轻量级的剪贴板管理器，与 GNOME 集成得很好。

📥 获取 Clipboard

你可以通过从 GitHub 获取或浏览其 官方网站 开始你的剪贴板之旅。它还包含所有必要的安装指南和文档。

Lately I’ve been trying to find a way to restore win10 so I could properly dual boot but instead I accidentally lost the partition altogether and now I can’t boot either OS, all it says is “No bootable device — Please restart system”. A bit scared because I may have just lost quite a bit of files + my ledger live application. Any help would be greatly appreciated.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[新的 Anaconda Web UI 安装程序可能会随 Fedora 工作站 39 一同推出。




长期以来，Fedora 的安装体验一直未曾改变。

然而，这个新的 Web UI 安装程序已经开发了一年多的时间，现在离正式实现的目标更近了。

为什么现在是时候了？

在我们上次 了解 即将到来的 Anaconda WebUI 安装程序时，它的进展相当不错。

而现在，它已经提交了一份 变更提案，旨在将这个安装程序添加到 Fedora 工作站中，以提供现代化的用户体验。该提案正等待 Fedora 工程和指导委员会（FESCo）的审查。

让我们再次来看看即将到来的安装程序和提案，以及可以期待在 Fedora 发布中看到它的时间。

Anaconda WebUI：概述 ⭐



目前 Fedora 使用的旧的安装程序是基于 GTK3 的，在许多情况下已被证明效率低下和不安全。新的 Anaconda WebUI 安装程序旨在解决这个问题。

它使用了一个由 Anaconda 团队开发的 基于 PatternFly 的现代后端和用户界面。

后端由 Python、DBus、Cockpit、React 和 PatternFly 组成，旨在从一开始解决许多已知的用户体验问题，并为一致的安装体验铺平了道路。

变更提案还提到了新 UI 的一些关键亮点，包括：


向导式解决方案而非中心轮毂式。

新的欢迎屏幕用于选择语言（将从系统中配置的语言预先选择）。

时区和日期配置。

磁盘选择。

引导式分区。

配置审核。

安装进度。

内置帮助。


主要关注的重点是向用户提供类似向导的体验，提供更多信息，并帮助他们更好地完成安装过程。

这个新安装程序添加了很多功能，听起来是一个很好的用户体验改变！ 😃

那么，我们可以期待什么时候呢？

由于这个变更需要经过 FESCo 的批准，一切取决于投票过程的进行。

但是，我相当有信心这个变更会得到批准，因为 变更提案 已经设定了 在 Fedora 39 中发布新的 Anaconda WebUI 安装程序 的目标。

💬 这个变更批准只是时间问题；您对此有什么看法？

在今日的思想界，霍布斯被视为不可或缺的重要思想家。他所建立的近代社会契约论框架成为现代政治制度的重要来源。不过，正如意大利哲学家诺伯特·博比奥（Norberto Bobbio）所指出的，对霍布斯的再解释更多是二十世纪的结果。在此之前，霍布斯更多被视为不入流的哲学家，是对乃师培根的拙劣模仿。黑格尔的《哲学史讲演录》将霍布斯的思想视为肤浅的经验主义，认为其中缺乏真正的哲学。博比奥诙谐地写道：“那些年里，霍布斯被毫无根据地指控为极权主义国家的先驱。前述霍布斯政治思想研究的最重要成果之一出自一位政治上可疑的作者卡尔·施密特之手。”
《霍布斯与自然法传统》是博比奥关于霍布斯研究数十年结果的集合。作为意大利重要的霍布斯研究者，博比奥认为自然法在霍布斯的政治哲学中占据最为关键的地位。通过将前政治状态转移到自然状态中，霍布斯得以建立自然状态-政治状态的结构演化模型。霍布斯是一个绝对主义者，但也是一个理性主义者。通过彻底的计算理性推论，霍布斯为现代政治找到了一条不依赖于神学的途径。国家不是自然的产物，而是人类的创造。“如果我们接受人类受命改正自然，而不仅仅是模仿自然的话，那么建立国家就是他们作为能工巧匠的能力的最为高尚和最为高贵的表达。”
不过，由于《霍布斯与自然法传统》一书是由博比奥多年来关于霍布斯的文章拼凑而成，所以章节之间没有明显的联系，讨论的内容也显得较为驳杂。对该书的评价更多着眼于他在霍布斯研究一些基本问题上的立场和看法，而非完整的体系论证。
自然状态与自然法
霍布斯的自然状态一直是所有学者研究的重点。即便是不曾读过霍布斯作品的非专业人士，也对霍布斯所描述的“一切人反对一切人”式的自然状态有所耳闻。其中的关键问题在于，这种自然状态究竟是一种纯粹的理论假设…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Howdy y'all, we've all heard of weird stories of porting Linux to a toaster or whatever. I think it's such a great example of the benefits of open-source software but I don't know of many instances. 
 So I was wondering what are some of the most niche and unexpected devices people have successfully ported Linux to? Whether it's obscure hardware like a calculator watch, or just getting Linux to run on some ancient archaic system, anything that highlights the utility of open-source by adapting Linux to work in crazy environments. 
 Thanks :)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi,
 I'm looking to build a new equipment and I would like some advice on it. I won't play on it so I'm going small size and no dedicated GPU. The use will be navigating the web, watch videos, downloads,... No gaming, no video editing or anything very intensive.
 I know an Intel i3 would be enough but I want something more powerfull and I can't decide between an i5-12400 and a Ryzen 5700G. Which one will perform better with Linux? (I can't tell you which distro because I distrohop like I'm posessed so I usually go with Mint, XFCE or KDE).
 The case I'm thinking of is this one:
 Sparrow MQ4
 So I don't need PSU and the motherboard should be ITX.
 What do you think about the CPU?
 Cheers.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have been a Linux user since the year 2019. I used to run Linux on my all-in-one PC, which had an Intel CPU without any dedicated GPU. The experience there was perfect; I had zero complaints with any of the distributions I tried, but the story changed when I recently bought a gaming laptop with an RTX 3050.
 As expected, the first thing I did was to remove Windows and try to install Fedora on it. At first, the live USB wouldn't even boot because of the missing GPU drivers, so I tried the safe graphics mode, and then, after completing the install, I added the Nvidia drivers. In the beginning, it worked fine, but after some time, performance issues started to occur. Sometimes the OS freezes on the login screen or gives me a blank screen after I enter my password and press enter.
 I was determined that I wanted to use Linux because I like the playing around and freedom that it gives the user, so I tried other distros based on Fedora, RHEL, Ubuntu, and even Arch. I tried different DEs and switched between X11 and Wayland, but everything always gave me some kind of performance dip or left my laptop unresponsive just because of the GPU.
 In the past, when I used Linux on my PC and an old laptop that didn't have a GPU, it always worked fine, but now I am forced to use Windows just because Nvidia has a shitty Linux support.
 At this point I am tired of trying to configure everything by myself and yet getting no results, but I really want to move away from windows so if you guys got any suggestions, I am open to that.

 I have citra installed through emudeck, it will launch through steam and it will launch through using the command "flatpak run org.citra_emu.citra" but it WILL NOT launch through the desktop shortcut or from the discovery store or the apps list in the start/windows menu. Wtf is the problem? It's giving me a real headache. 
 Also I know there's two citras in the discover store, there wasnt before and i alresdy had the problem, I tried installing it through the flathub install command to try fix the problem, it didn't work.
 I also tried uninstalling and reinstalling through both emudeck and the discover store

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Here's my issue, every time i work on the look of my computers i end up having to propagate changes to a ton of files. Usually while programming you'd want your data that's used in multiple places to be anchored to variables.
 I'm kinda struggling to find a general purpose way of transfering colors, fonts, sizes, across very different applications i.e. terminal, i3config, gtk...
 I'm not a top notch programmer but i'm not an idiot either. I've mulled over the issue for a little while and would like opinions before commiting to what i'd consider to be a sizeable amount of work.
 I'm not comming here empty handed either.
 Take the terminal for instance: gogh has a build process that uses yaml for theme definitions, python for generation/building and bash for installation. It would be pretty easy to use/hijack the build process by simply generating a yaml def.
 For anything that's css-like: a tool like sass or similar is perfect, i'd just have to include my variables. I've seen a couple gtk themes using this.
 Any other configuration that uses text files should be trivial, i'm just uncertain what would be the least painful approach.
 Preprocessing options i've been coming across are: - awk / sed - probably the most painful approach imo - gpp - first time using it but seems to be a good powerful solution - node using gulp or grunt and whatever other rendering tool - i have some experience with this toolset but i feel it's not suited for the task and at this point any programming language that has printf/template strings would give the same result.
 What i'm considering is using make to process sources into a build/staging folder and then letting each 'facet' of themeing run their own build processes if needed.
 So what approach have you been using to tackle this problem?

在限制未登录用户访问 Twitter 后，它又遭遇了严重技术故障，Elon Musk 以有人在大规模抓取推文为由宣布了限流措施：普通用户每天只能阅读 600 则推文，认证用户 6000，新注册用户 300（之后又宣布略微放宽限制）。但有开发者认为不是有人在抓取推文，而是它自己的问题导致了它自己对自己发动 DDoS 攻击。

GIMP 3.0 今年有望发表候选版本

最近，GIMP 的主要开发者们召开了自 2019 年来的首次开发者会议，“Wilber Week”。这是一个为期一周的会议，在阿姆斯特丹的 Blender 基金会总部举行。根据会议发布的信息，看起来他们可能会在今年至少开始 GIMP 3.0 的候选版本阶段。目前正在开发的是 GIMP 2.99.16 版本。作为备受期待的对 GTK3 的移植，以及作为 Photoshop 的开源替代品的一系列其他改进，GIMP 3.0 已经酝酿了十年。会议还讨论了可能成立 GIMP 基金会的计划。

老王点评：说实话，已经对等待 GIMP 3.0 没有激情了。或许，抛下沉重的历史包袱的办法就是破而后立。




远程工作使美国人的生产力下降

美国劳工统计局的新数据发现，2022 年有三分之一的美国人在家工作，高于 2019 年的四分之一。调查还发现，在家全职工作的美国人比在办公室的美国人每天少工作 2.5 小时。如果人们回到办公室，像 2019 年一样每天工作 8.2 小时，而不是每天在家的 5.7 小时，那么美国经济就会增加了大约 8 亿周的工作量，即提升 8%。

基于我对 RHEL 和其他红帽产品的热爱，我不得不现在表达一些严厉的看法。我之所以这样做，是因为我希望 RHEL [及/或其克隆版] 对每个人都是 可获得的。

请原谅这次我用词有些激烈，因为我从内心不希望 RHEL 成为 对业余爱好者不可及 的产品。免费的 RHEL 开发者许可证只是转移话题而已，相比于 真正的 RHEL 克隆版存在的时候，它削弱了 广大动手爱好者社区 的热情。


🗒️ 对于我的使用场景来说，使用免费订阅的 RHEL 使我感到满意。实际上，我正在使用的就是免费订阅。本文是关于如果保持这种状态会对 RHEL 产生怎样的影响。


快速回顾：事情是如何走到这一步的

我相信你现在都已经知道为什么红帽公司最近频频出现在新闻中：

但是，如果你对正在发生的事情一无所知，让我给你一个快速时间线的指引，帮助你理解：


红帽公司拥有一个出色的 Linux 发行版，名为 红帽企业 LinuxRed Hat Enterprise Linux（RHEL），支持周期长达 10 年。

与其他任何 Linux 发行版一样，用于构建 RHEL（或 RHEL 的 克隆版）的源代码是公开可用的。

CentOS 利用上述源代码，去除商标，并创建了一个几乎 1 比 1 的 RHEL 拷贝。（我说“几乎”是因为 RHEL 的商标 必须 被删除。）

那些不愿意支付费用只是为了第一次尝试 RHEL 的爱好者社区，现在可以使用 CentOS 来看看是否喜欢它。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[林峥（章静绘）

公园是十九世纪中期西方为因应工业革命带来的城市问题而创造的产物，它是现代都市之心，是城市规划中始终挥之不去的乌托邦理想。在中国，“公园”一词古已有之，指称的却是官家园林，与西方public park的概念完全不同。中山大学中文系副教授林峥的《公园北京》考察公园作为一个新兴的西方文明装置如何进入近代北京的过程。以公园为视角，该书呈现了晚清至民国北京政治、社会、历史、文化、文学诸方面纷繁复杂的变革。近日，《上海书评》专访了林峥，请她谈谈与近代北京公园互为表里的文化生产与文学想象。

《公园北京：文化生产与文学想象（1860-1937）》，林峥著，北京大学出版社，2022年10月出版，408页，79.00元

您认为公园作为西方文明装置，进入近代北京，体现了另一种现代性。您对这种现代性的解释是以旧纳新、以新化旧，它表现为最旧的帝国遗迹同时也是最新的公共场域，表现为在外观古色古香的建筑内部引入现代设施。为什么这是“另一种”现代性？
林峥：现代性的概念源自西方，与都市相伴相生，纷繁复杂，中国对于现代性的理解，主要体现为晚清五四以来一种以西方（启蒙现代性）为模板的、线性进步的发展观。这样建立在西方启蒙传统加诸被曲解的社会达尔文主义之上的对于现代性的理解，容易造成一味趋新、趋西的心态。同时我认为，中国在现代化、都市化的过程中有自身独特的发展脉络，若以西方的现代性理论轨范中国城市，很难完全解释与涵盖中国的经验，这也是我为何选择“公园北京”作为研究对象的原因。
一方面，公园是西方现代都市文明的象征，清末民初的政府、启蒙知识分子也是从这个思路出发，将公园引进中国；但另一方面，近代北京的公园又不是另起炉灶、照搬西式，而是在前朝皇家园林坛庙的基础上改造开放，这造就了近代北京公园的特殊性。它的风景情致是中式的，内在精神又是现代的，既是最旧的帝国遗迹，也是最新的公共场域。可与之相对比…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I want to summarize a few thought about this subject, that I have been commenting around (like everyone else) on different threads. 
 On one hand, I absolutely respect the FOSS culture, and what those countless developers have done to push Linux over the years. Tails is probably one of the biggest example of it, and how important it can be for everyone else to have projects like this.
 Nonetheless, I think that many of our well known influencers (aka the YouTubers) aren't considering the importance of profit and business culture for the long term survival, and development of Linux as a whole. Valve, Canonical, Red Hat IBM, System76, Tuxedo, etc. they all have different approaches, but they understand that to go further, they can´t rely on donations and patrons forever. Probably they have m…]]></summary>

 I had no experience with anything other than Windows when i bought myself a Raspberry Pi 3B+.
 I had an awesome time using it, and looking back on it I'd say it was the only time I ever had a great time with Linux, and didn't have any real issues.
 A year later I started to dual boot Linux on my Laptop. I installed Debian, accidentally wiped the entire SSD, everything worked fine, reinstalled Windows & Debian after noticing it. After booting into Debian I'd get a kernel panic every time, with pulseaudio maxing out one core. I googled the error messages, didn't find any actual fix, so I gave up and used Ubuntu instead. Saying that I had a bad start with desktop Linux would be an understatement.
 Ubuntu didn't go too bad…]]></summary>

 Probably a stupid question here. Had been using Zorin OS 16 off and on for the past year or so but recently upgraded to a 7900 XT. Needed a more up to date distro so was looking into Fedora. Not the biggest fan of the standard gnome layout so I was trying the new Budgie spin but there doesn’t seem to be an option to enable the Third Party Repository?
 I had previously installed the standard Fedora and it asked me during setup, didn’t for the Budgie. Not even an option in the software store settings like i’ve seen in all the guides. Is this just available in standard Fedora Workstation? Is this just a Budgie thing? Or am I just a big dummy missing something obvious.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[For years, the tearing protocol has been one of the most controversial features regarding Wayland. Competitive gamers didn't want forced vsync for latency reasons so they kept using Xorg, and many many posts have been made regarding this situation. Only recently it was merged into the Wayland protocol but seemengly no compositor was using it.
 After updating my system about a week ago (notably with the new Nvidia 535 driver), I launched Nier Automata with direct scanout enabled in Hyprland's config file and... surprise! There's no forced vsync and I can notice tearing. I decided to test League of Legends too and it definitely works, I can now uncap my framerate and get it to ~400fps, but if it drops below my monitor's refresh rate (144Hz) tearing is noticeable.
 So... isn't this supposed to be a big thing? Why is no one talking about it?

 The bridge has its own MAC address distinct from the eno1 actual physical ethernet device. That's all fine.
 As I picture this in my head, I picture the nm-bridge device as like a physical layer 2 managed switch and the eno1 ethernet port as a computer connected to one of the ports of that managed switch. Then any VM's I create in virt-manager I also assign to nm-bridge an these are just equivalent to new computers being plugged into the layer 2 man…]]></summary>

I'm Gabriel, CEO and co-founder of Meticulous.
Our mission is to radically accelerate the pace of software development for every company in the world. We're starting with a tool to catch UI bugs in web applications with zero-effort from developers.
How it works: Insert a single line of JavaScript onto your site, and we record thousands of real user sessions. We then replay these sessions on head and base commits of PRs, take screenshots at key points, and diff those screenshots to catch visual regressions before they hit production. We employ novel techniques to eliminate flakes. You can watch a 60-second demo at [meticulous.ai](http://meticulous.ai/).

 Just on a short note:
 - Recently we acquired Linux.Forum and have set up our Linux.Chat Support Forums
 - We've repurposed Linux.Community as a Linux and open source focussed Lemmy instance (Reddit-like) 
 This brings our community count to 5:
 => #linux on Libera.Chat
 => Linux.Chat on Discord
 => @linux.social (Mastodon instance)
 => Linux.Chat Support Forums (on linux.forum)
 => Linux.Chat Communities (on linux.community)
 A Matrix instance is coming at some time in the future as soon as we've moved our moderation bot architecture to something a bit more platform agnostic.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[中国用人工智能在 5 小时内设计出 RISC-V CPU

在一篇由中科院、中科大的研究人员发表的论文中，详细介绍了他们在 5 小时内设计出一个新的工业规模的 RISC-V CPU 的工作。据称，这要比人类团队完成类似的 CPU 设计快 1000 倍左右。该 CPU 的设计是 “仅从外部输入-输出观察中形成的，而不是正式的程序代码”。它还拥有令人印象深刻的 11 个 9 的的准确性。该 CPU 采用 65 纳米制造，可以以高达 300MHz 的速度运行。他们在该 CPU 上运行了 Linux 内核 5.15 的操作系统，基准测试显示该 CPU 性能大约与 i486 相当。研究人员认为，他们“从头发现了冯-诺伊曼架构”。

老王点评：重要的不是设计出来的芯片有多强，而是 AI 可以这么快就完成了芯片设计，而且走了一条不同的设计道路。更好的是，这是国内的团队完成的研究。




为什么 Mastodon 无法取代 Twitter

即使 Twitter 用户体验多么糟糕，它的老板多么令人讨厌，它的用户仍然留在那里，去中心化微博客替代 Mastodon 未能吸引到更多 Twitter 用户。一位前 Mastodon 实例管理员解释了其中的原因：对于绝大多数用户而言 Mastodon 没有独特的卖点，从功能上讲它本质上是 2008 年的 Twitter，而从功能角度看 2023 年的 Twitter 能让绝大多数用户满意；对 99% 的用户来说去中心化不是卖点，就像绝大多数用户不在意开源或自由软件，在意识形态上也不反对私有软件；去中心化让用户体验糟糕；管理 Mastodon 的人对现状感到满意，他们认为其他人只需要接受就行，新用户无法将他们的体验反馈给管理者，他们会选择离开；Mastodon 扩展性不行，其用户群只接受慈善不接受其它任何资助模式；在很大程度上，Mastodon 的文化是排外的。


消息来源：Solidot



老王点评：去中心化并不是灵丹妙药，甚至我觉得它可能会一直处于非主流，虽然它的存在是非常必要的。




谷歌决定不支付加拿大的“链接税”

加拿大通过了《在线新闻法》，要求谷歌和 Facebook 为简单地显示新闻链接付费，而其他人都是免费的。谷歌和 Facebook 都拒绝了加拿大的要求，它们都决定从其平台上删除加拿大的新闻内容。谷歌称，“对链接进行定价（所谓的‘链接税’）的史无前例的决定，为我们的产品带来了不确定性，并使我们仅仅因为方便加拿大人获取加拿大出版商的新闻而面临不设上限的财务责任。”谷歌在 2021 年 1 月对澳大利亚的 “链接税” 法律采取了类似的立场，但谷歌在几周后就同意为澳大利亚的新闻付费。此外，谷歌还同意向法国新闻网站支付费用。而美国也正在制定类似的法律。


消息来源：Ars Technica



老王点评：看来“吃大户”的想法哪里都有，就像还有些人准备让大型 IT 公司额外负担光缆的费用一样。但是从另外一个方面看，似乎这些具有垄断性质的 IT 巨头，应该承担更多的责任和付出。你怎么看呢？]]></summary>

The theory is these drives have custom firmware, but I believe it's just as simple as a serial number pair for the drives and dock, plus a 256 bit SATA drive password.
 Installing one of these drives in a PC and attempting to boot from it results in a password prompt. The first 4,096 sectors are supposedly reserved and cannot be read by the host PC over USB. Some people have reported certain Linux tools would allow them to reset the SATA password but I'm not sure this is true. Others have claimed "true" drive cloners could access and dump these reserved sectors, assuming that is true as well.
 This video discusses it but it's nearly a decade old, when these products were relatively new. Has anyone made any tools to dump these sectors, reset the SATA passwords, or do a more complete wipe of these cartidges to make them usable as standard SATA drives?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[以下是如何将用户添加到 Debian Linux 中的 SUDOERS 组的方法。


在 Debian Linux 中，SUDOERS 组在向用户授予管理权限方面发挥着至关重要的作用。将用户添加到 SUDOERS 组使他们能够以 root 权限执行命令，从而为他们提供必要的管理访问权限以在 Debian 系统上执行各种任务。

在安装 Debian Linux 的过程中，如果你将 root 帐户的密码保留为空，那么系统中的 创建的第一个用户 将拥有管理权限。但是，如果你设置了 root 密码，那么用户名将不具有 sudo 权限。因此，在使用用户帐户执行管理任务时，你可能会遇到以下类似的错误。

<username> is not in the sudoers file. This incident will be reported.




本文旨在提供有关在 Debian 中向 SUDOERS 组添加用户的分步指南，确保你可以有效地管理用户权限和系统安全。

如何将用户添加到 Debian 中的 SUDOERS 组

要将用户添加到 Debian 中的 SUDOERS 组，请按照以下简单步骤操作：


单击“终端”图标或使用快捷键 Ctrl+Alt+T，打开 Debian 系统上的终端。

使用以下命令切换到 root 用户：


su -


系统将提示你提供 root 密码。输入 root 密码并按回车键。

以 root 用户身份登录后，输入以下命令。确保根据你的用户名进行更改。在此示例中，将 arindam 替换为你的用户名。

/sbin/addgroup arindam sudo


如果上面的命令无效，还可以使用下面的命令：

usermod -aG sudo arindam


按退出离开 root 提示符。注销并重新登录。现在你可以使用你的用户名执行任何管理操作。

另一种方法

你可以使用与下面相同的命令进入 root 帐户。使用 root 账号登录：

su -


然后使用 nano 或 visudo 或任何编辑器打开 /etc/sudoers 文件。

nano /etc/sudoers


添加以下行和用户名。根据你的用户名替换 arindam。

arindam    ALL=(ALL)    ALL


保存并关闭文件。然后，注销并重新登录。这应该会给用户名 root 权限。

验证 SUDOERS 组成员

要验证用户是否已成功添加到 SUDOERS 组，你可以打开一个新的终端窗口并输入以下命令。将 arindam 替换为你添加到 SUDOERS 组的用户的实际用户名。

sudo -l -U arindam


如果用户是 SUDOERS 组的成员，你将看到他们拥有的权限列表。这是一个示例，你可以看到我的用户名具有所有访问权限。



结束语

将用户添加到 SUDOERS 组将授予他们重要的管理权限。在授予用户此类访问权限之前，仔细考虑用户的可信度和责任非常重要。sudo 使用不当可能会导致系统意外损坏或受损。

请记住在委派管理权限时要小心谨慎，并定期检查用户权限以维护安全的 Debian 系统。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I consider cross-platform for PC software as Linux, Windows and x86 Mac.
 I've tried a bit of AutoKey, not a lot. AutoHotkey I've used for a while, it does allow creating UI's, but it feels wrong. It's not cross-platform.
 What would you consider a good solution or stack to create similar functionality?
 What functionality? Good question. AutoHotkey and AutoKey let you remap, input devices. I'm not going to say all input devices, but it seems possible. So you hit Mouse4 on your mouse and that could do anything, like press, (Ctrl+~ ; htop) for a quick htop macro if using something like a quake-mode terminal. You do have to manually type each macro by hand. So asking what functionality is it just letting the user type some hotkey in a text file, or is it a UI letting them record a macro, ala vim style.
 I'd rather it be easier for the user and they can choose, a UI or CLI + user created macro file, both options able to be used on demand.
 I'm sure I could name any language or libs/stack and someone could find a way to create it using that. What would you suggest?
 EDIT:
 Came across a post mentioning Python as a possible replacement for AutoHotkey and how it's faster to create a UI. It's not about that for me or this project. The primary goal is cross-platform OSS, if it can't do that, it's not comparable. To me the only difficulty would be finding a library that already has the ability to accept any form of user input from any input device. If the language doesn't offer that, then that language is not an option as this isn't a driver-level project.
 What about something like QMK firmware found on some advanced keyboards? If you know what I just said, fist bump. If you're familiar with Steam Input and how that lets you configure controllers, that's a bit like QMK firmware. That's the goal, to let the user be able to do anything with their devices. I'm ignorant if some library like that exists, you think a gamedev would be able to better answer the question?

寺田浩明教授所著《清代传统法秩序》（日文原名为“中国法制史”，以下称“本书”），是近些年中日法制史学界、明清史学界期待已久的著作。本书一经面世，日本《史学杂志》《法制史研究》《中国研究月报》相继刊发了久保茉莉子、森田成满、高见泽磨等重要学者的书评；赵晶教授主持的《中国古代法律文献研究》（第十二辑，社科文献出版社，2018年）在第一时间刊发了本书第八章的译文（黄琴唐译）以及伍跃、阿风、赵思渊、孔令伟四位分别来自社会史、法律史、经济史、“新清史”等领域的学者撰写的书评。
寺田教授自1983年开始发表了一系列在中日两国均具有重要影响的论文。在本书之前，寺田教授唯一的一本书是中文版的论文集：《权利与冤抑：寺田浩明中国法史论集》（清华大学出版社，2012年），收录了他十五篇主要论文，涵盖了其学术生涯二十六篇论文的主要篇章。在寺田教授四十年的学术生涯（从1977年至本书完成的2017年）中，本书只是第二本书，也是唯一一本体系性的著作。
《清代传统法秩序》的结构
作为代表了一个时代的学者，在退休的时候出版了一生唯一的体系性著作，无论对于作者、同侪、读者，都有非同寻常的意义。因此，复述一下本书的基本内容仍是必要的。
在本书中，寺田教授首先给出了一个理解清代法秩序的基本前提，即“早熟的国家与社会的二元性”，将清代定义为由统一的官僚制国家所统辖的“大规模的市场社会、契约社会、诉讼社会”（第4页）。以此理解为基础，全书从家（家族）的实态开始，依序讨论家的经济基础，家与家之间如何建立、发展出社会，而后逐步进入法与裁判的相关问题。
第一章虽名“人与家”，依次延续滋贺秀三（1921-2008）的理论讨论了“同居共财”的家（父亲所统率、代表的近亲者成为一体而经营生活的生活共同体…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Pirate Enlightenment, or the Real Libertalia by David Graeber, Allen Lane,  January 2023, 208pp

如果大卫·格雷伯在你心目中是一位无政府主义活动家，“占领华尔街”运动的精神领袖，或者是2018年那本《毫无意义的工作》（Bullshit Jobs）的挥斥方遒的作者，你可能会惊讶地发现，他还写过一本关于海盗和政治思想的书，以十八世纪的马达加斯加（位于非洲东海岸外的巨大岛屿，大约有两个半英国那么大）为背景。
事实上，《海盗启蒙》标志着这位著名的人类学家回归了他最初的兴趣。格雷伯于两年前去世，在他还是一名在读研究生时，曾经花了几年时间去马达加斯加做田野考察。他勾搭上一位当地妇女后，发现她认为自己属于一个独特的族群，其成员的祖先可以追溯到加勒比海盗，这激发了他的兴趣。
后来他在大英图书馆发现了一份未曾发表过的十九世纪初手稿，其中收录了一位法国冒险家所描述的马达加斯加复杂的内部历史的片段。该手稿以一位名为拉齐米拉霍（Ratsimilaho）的传奇人物为中心，这位年轻的战士是一名英国海盗与一名马达加斯加妇女的儿子，在十八世纪初他成为了一场长达十年的战争中的领袖，建立了历史上的贝奇米萨拉卡（Betsimisaraka）邦联——位于马达加斯加东北海岸的一个庞大而崭新的政治实体。
几十年来格雷伯一直围着这份手稿的一个副本打转，但直到他生命的最后阶段，才最终坐下来仔细处理其内容。其成果就是这本篇幅不长但引人入胜的书，之前已经出版了法文和意大利文版。
曾活跃于加勒比海的英国海盗从1690年代开始在马达加斯加北部建立基地，方便他们劫掠。1695年，亨利·艾弗里（又名艾维里）及其船员攻击了一支前往麦加的莫卧儿帝国船队，并俘虏了其中两艘满载财富的船只，从而获得了价值六十万英镑（按今天的币值计算约为一亿英镑）的巨额财宝。
英国和法国政府最终成功打击了这种行径。艾弗里失踪了，其他数百名海盗则退至马达加斯加。逍遥法外的白人亡命徒在某个非洲岛屿上建立个人领地的想法令当时的欧洲人兴奋不已。从伦敦到莫斯科，各国政府都在与所谓的艾弗里的使者进行条约谈判，此时在传言中艾弗里已经成为马达加斯加的海盗国王。当时许多流行说法都是对他行径的描述与发挥。
丹尼尔·笛福就是被此类故事所吸引的人之一。在他出版《鲁滨逊漂流记》的几年后，一本名为《海盗通史》的书于1724年在伦敦上市，可能就是他写的。书中描述了一个奉行平等主义的马达加斯加海盗共和国，名为利伯塔利亚（Libertalia）——一个乌托邦殖民地，由思想自由、生活自由的自由海盗组成，致力于贯彻平等主义，人民直接管治。
格雷伯承认，这种说法被广泛认为是一个寓言，而且关于海盗和当地人在三百年前的马达加斯加究竟如何生活，现存的证据少之又少。但他并未因此而退缩。总体上来说，他的任务是论证我们如何看待欧洲启蒙运动从现在已经被遗忘的非欧洲思想家和社会实践中获得的诸多灵感。他推测，贝奇米萨拉卡邦联可以说某种程度上是现实中的利伯塔利亚，“海盗管治和马达加斯加传统政治文化中一些更具平等主义元素的创造性综合”。
他对这一论点的阐述涉及对马达加斯加政治、性别和社会历史的人类学文献的冗长解析。遗憾的是，格雷伯的论述也夸大了海盗式社会关系的先进性，称其具有真正的革命意义。例如，当笛福描述海盗社区通过抽签选择十二个人来解决争端时，格雷伯兴奋地将此吹嘘为他们新颖的“民主制度”的证据，据说是基于海盗船上独特的平等主义环境。他没有注意到的是，这段描述仅仅是对众所周知的陪审团审判原则的翻版，笛福当年的读者肯定会发现这一点。

《万物的黎明》英文书影

和他最近与大卫·温格罗（David Wengrow）合著的《万物的黎明：人类的新历史》（The Dawn of Everything: A New History of Humanity）一样（那本书在更大的范围内提出了相关的论点），读格雷伯的主要乐趣并不在于要同意他的论点。相反，他通过一系列挑衅性的思想实验，一再迫使我们重新思考我们在当下的生活方式。无论十八世纪的马达加斯加发生过什么，《海盗启蒙》意味着，在我们自己的社会、性别与政治安排中，必然能够更进一步地贯彻自由思考和平等主义。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I recently switched to Ubuntu as my primary OS(have been using ubuntu for a year but used windows primarily). I used a fix(https://www.cmscritic.com/how-to-fix-nvidia-screen-tearing-in-xfce-mate-kde-lxde-and-others/) for the screen tearing It worked out too perfectly as even with vsync off in every single game(CS:GO, Minecraft.......) there is no screen tearing at all. I am curious to know why is that. I have been struggling with screen tearing on Windows with vsync off and I am never switching again to Windows.

 I am just trying to make a script to launch a script that is going to launch both elastic and kibana for the time I need them because it is convinient to have.
 Here is what I have in my sh script
  
(until ([redacted]elasticsearch-8.6.1/bin/elasticsearch &) | grep -q 'shards started' | head ; do sleep 1; done; echo 'Elastic Started');
 (until ([redacted]kibana-8.6.1/bin/kibana &) | grep -q 'Kibana is now available' | head ; do sleep 1; done; echo 'Kibana Started');
  
And it looks nice and it works like for 10-15 minutes, but then after some time I get the following
  
Error: write EPIPE

I thought it was just my phone acting up but then I realized that’s about 12am UTC.  With the death of Apollo also goes the metaphorical death of all the best parts (IMO) of the internet: open-source, creativity, entrepreneurial spirit. Sad day. I guess I’ll go outside now.
Edit: sorry, Apollo wasn’t open source. That’s what happens when I make a post while two beers deep I guess. Hopefully you get the general spirit of what I was trying to convey.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am still on X11 (don't kill me I am still on Nvidia) and was looking for a screen locker. This lead me to a deep rabbit hole of repeated warnings that there is no way to securely do lock screens on X11. Here is an example https://blog.martin-graesslin.com/blog/2015/01/why-screen-lockers-on-x11-cannot-be-secure/
 Majority of the complaints repeat the following as some of the primary reasons
  
X has no concept of screen lockers.
 A screen locker is just another client for X.
 There is no privileged process which acts as the one and only screen locker
 If the locker crashes you have access to the machine.
 On X11: it’s not possible to prevent that other windows grab screen content. (This is something that Wayland can solve that X11 never can)
  
My questions is why don't display managers take on the task of locking sessions.
 For instance I use LightDM. It seems to run as root, and is what is starting the X server for me.
 If LightDM (or any similar display manager) had a concept of locking sessions, then wouldn't that solve most problems.
  
The display manager could just lock the current session in a given VT
 It will then switch/redirect users to a different VT where the password dialog shows up (this is a different process).
 On successful authentication we can notify the original DM process to unlock the session.
  
Light-locker seems to operate similarly, but LightDM itself does not really seem to know anything about it.
 Obviously we still cannot prevent 5. which is inherent to Xorg, but if I don't care about 5. I don't see why display managers can't do this?

 ​
 I am not in a position to convert all keys to sha2 at this time, so please help me identify what needs to be changed on the server to temporarily authenticate via ssh-rsa and ssh-dss
 I appreciate any help you can provide.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello everyone,
 I'm a Debian family (Ubuntu primarily) user who recently switched to a mechanical keyboard and who is a native italian language speaker.
 The "US Intl. With Dead Keys" layout allows me to type accented characters I need (examples: à è ì ò ù) with just one modifier key right before the non-accented one.
 It works very well but it slows me down. My question is:
 Is there any software/workaround/script that will allow to type a specific defined character every time I double-press something? Example:
  
ee -> should type: è
 oo -> should type: ò
  
Any ideas?
 Thank you!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[For semantics and curiosity sake, do any of you guys know the following? I’ve done some google searches and wasn’t able to find details on the following question.
 Are there any other Enterprise level distributions (Ubuntu, Suse, etc) that have downstream distributions of their enterprise level offerings? From the exposure I’ve had to Ubuntu, there are some security and live patches and faster security fixes. These features are behind a paywall and presumably eventually end up in the main Ubuntu distribution. I am also not aware of any downstream builds of Ubuntu Pro or Suse Linux Enterprise.
 As I’m NOT an enterprise user putting boxes into production with business on the line, and everything I’m reading is that Centos Stream will likely handle what I’m trying to do without much fuss.
 Am I missing something here? Seems to me that Redhat is aligning their offerings and paywalls similarly to Ubuntu and Suse? Am I oversimplifying this, missing a key detail?

 https://www.dnsleaktest.com/
 To test my dns setup and check for leak
 https://ipleak.net/
 To check my ip and also check for leaks 
 https://whoer.net/port-scanner-online
 To check for open ports
 I run rkhunter, clamAV, lynis, to check for security issues 
 I just found out about the command sudo rpm --verify -a
 That checks all packages for changes I'm still learning how to use it
 Im sure there is alot of usefull commands im not aware of 
 What other useful tricks should i be aware of?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all, 
 I'm facing some issues related to the replacement of the my Macbook Pro early 2015 battery. 
 The story: Few years ago I stopped to use my Macbook and at that time the original battery was at 80% capacity. After 1 year (maybe more) I take back my mac and it didn't started without power supply (in the meanwhile nobody used it). Tried to take in charge it for several hours, but not changed, the battery was KO. 
 In add to this, few weeks ago I installed Fedora on my macbook, because MacOS was really slow. The OS works flawlessly, but of course nothing changed regarding the battery (need the power supply to turn on). 
 Last week I bought a non-original battery (a good one, considering the price - I hope :D) but what happens now is that my macbook still do not turn on without power supply, but immediately after the apple logo come up, I can pull off the charger and the macbook go on with its own battery. The strange things: 
 - Fedora do not recognize the battery (tried by terminal), also if in that moment it's working with that 
 - The mac wants the power supply just to turn on (with just the battery it doesn't start). 
 Already tried few SMC reset but nothing changed. Also tried another battery, but got the same result. 
 What it could be? Do you have any recommendations? 
 Thank you in advance.

 Question? For the above specs , is there any Linux os that could run smoothly on this laptop ? My mom wants it for web surfing. Xubuntu runs but playing YouTube videos is a no go. Is it even possible for this system to run youtube and browse web without too much trouble . I am all ears . Open to suggestions

Linus Torvalds 在改进一个性能优化补丁后说，“有些人通过在泳池边喝杯好酒来放松，我通过玩内联汇编来放松”。这个补丁是为正在进行的 Linux 6.5 合并窗口提出的，它大幅提升了吞吐量，并降低了用于校验的 csum_partial 函数调用的延迟。在某些情况下，可能会有 8~9% 的延迟改善，以及大约 30% 的吞吐量改善。另外一个内核工程师调侃道，“还有第三种人，他们在游泳池边喝着好酒，同时玩着内联汇编”。


消息来源：Phoronix



老王点评：好吧，真是独特的放松方式。我的放松方式之一就是写写代码，前提是这些代码不让我暴跳如雷。😉




Rocky Linux 反对红帽的决定，并找出了合法获得 RHEL 源代码的方法

在红帽公司决定 限制 对 RHEL 源代码的访问后，并通过服务条款（TOS）和最终用户许可协议（EULA）施加了一些条件，试图阻碍合法客户行使 GPL 所保证的权利。Rocky Linux 认为“这种协议违反了开源的精神和目的”，并已经找出了其它获得 RHEL 源代码的方法：一个选择是通过使用 UBI 容器镜像，它是基于 RHEL 的，可以从多个在线来源获得；另一个方法是通过按使用量付费的公共云实例，从而获得所有软件包和勘误表的源代码，并且可以通过 CI 管道自动完成所有这些工作。Rocky Linux 强调，“这些方法之所以可能是因为 GPL 的力量。没有人可以阻止 GPL 软件的再分发。重申一下，这两种方法使我们能够合法地获得 RHEL 二进制文件和源码包，而不影响我们对开源软件的承诺，也不会受到妨碍我们权利的 TOS 或 EULA 限制。”

老王点评：我觉得这件事上红帽是自取其辱。一方面用着 GPL 软件赚钱，另外一方面又试图无视 GPL 许可证赋予的权利。没错，红帽是“没有义务让重新构建者的工作更加容易”，但是从根本上它不能违反 GPL 协议而限制源代码的可得性。最终结果是，RHEL 下游发行版依然存在，红帽却显得吃相难看。




微软公开预览 Windows 11 Copilot

几个月前，微软在 Edge 和必应支持的任务栏搜索栏中加入了生成性人工智能。本周，微软在 Windows Insider 中为公共测试者提供了 Copilot 预览。用户可以按快捷键在屏幕右侧打开 Copilot 栏。除了聊天功能，Copilot 还将支持使用 OpenAI 的 DALL-E 2 模型创建图像。此外，Copilot 还将在一开始就推出必应广告，微软将为你提供该公司 “认为相关” 的广告。

老王点评：说实话我觉得现在的 AI 和操作系统的结合还属于生搬硬套，什么时候操作系统不需要人类“操作”了，才真正的变成了 AI 的“系统”。]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[香港本来只有一所颇具规模的大学，就是以英语教学的香港大学。1963年，中文教学的崇基学院、新亚书院和联合书院合并为“中文大学”。今年香港中文大学的六十周年校庆举办了一系列活动，我应中文系张健教授之邀于4月14日做了一次报告，谈“华人学者对北美汉学的贡献”。
这里“汉学”泛指海外的中国研究（虽说这名词在西方算过时了，学者大多会划定自己研究中国哪一领域）；“北美”则指美国和土地辽阔、人口却只有其十分之一、同属一个学术圈的加拿大。疫情期间香港中文大学曾办了个线上讲座，邀请在斯坦福教中国文学的艾朗诺与当了逾半世纪汉学“票友”的我谈“美国汉学五十年”。我们主要讲朗诺在加州大学、华盛顿大学及哈佛的老师们。我有感于有些人错以为“汉学家”都是白人，而一般“海外汉学”的讨论也有意无意地绕过华人，因此这一趟聚焦于华人学者，谈他们的背景，在汉学界的地位与所扮演的角色，最后略述我对汉学前景的一些看法。
其实北美汉学比欧洲起步晚却后来居上，华人学者的参与非常关键；尤其在文学领域内，近年来可说已取得压倒性的地位。北美汉学界华人多，有下列几个原因：
1）二十世纪初义和团运动，美国获得“庚子赔款”的百分之七点三二，比实际损失的要多些，就决定把多余的款项用以资助中国学生留美，培养了一批中英文俱佳的学人。这一千数百名留美学生大多攻读理工，回国后在各大学、政府机关或私人企业工作，也有一小部分在美国执教。
2）美国铝业公司创办人霍尔（Charles Martin Hall）没有子嗣，遗嘱把财产三分之一留给“英美人士在亚洲或巴尔干半岛办教育的机构”。为争取这笔巨款，当时在北平的燕京大学和美国麻州哈佛大学决定合办“哈佛燕京学社”，于1928年成立。当时北美开设与中国有关的课程寥寥无几，该社资助美国各大学有意从事中国学术研究的学生访华，也资助年轻燕京学人访学哈佛；同时在哈佛设立“哈佛燕京图书馆”和出版《哈佛亚洲研究学报…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[在这份超详细的指南中了解如何通过 i3 窗口管理器来自定义系统的外观和体验。


你可能在网上（尤其是通过 r/unixporn 子区）看到过很多炫酷的截图，用户可以根据个人喜好自定义他们的桌面并与大家分享。

这是因为 Linux 允许你自定义桌面体验的方方面面。

而结果？就是比任何 Mac 或 Windows 系统更具视觉和感知效果。

来看一下这个 😌



看起来像一个 Linux Mint 系统吗？ 😲

但是你怎样才能做到这样呢？自定义你的 Linux 桌面外观是很困难的。

答案就在于 窗口管理器。如果你能配置好窗口管理器，你就能自定义外观。

在本指南中，我将引导你完成使用 i3 窗口管理器 进行基本配置。它是 Linux 上最好的窗口管理器之一。


💡 “加料Rice” 是一个常用的词汇，用来指代在桌面上进行视觉改进和自定义。引用自 /r/unixporn （LCTT 译注：“加料”一词来自于购买便宜的亚洲汽车，并给它们安装售后零件，以让它更好地类似于赛车。）


在遵循本指南之前，你需要了解以下内容：


在本指南中，我将使用 Arch Linux 来演示步骤，但你可以使用你喜欢的任何发行版，结果也是一样的。

请记住，本指南是 对 i3 进行“加料”定制的基础。


在按照本指南进行操作后，你应该得到以下预期结果：




📥 为了节省你的时间，我已经在 GitHub 上上传了与本文相关的所有 i3 配置文件，你可以通过这些文件实现我们在本文中所期望的最终外观。



下载 i3 配置文件


首先，让我们开始安装 i3 窗口管理器。

在 Linux 上安装 i3 窗口管理器

 Overall, the reason for even having vDSO is the fact they are specific system calls that are used frequently by user-mode applications.Due to the time/cost of the context-switching between user-mode and kernel-mode in order to execute a syscall it might impact the overall performance of an application. 
 Thus, vDSO provides “virtual syscalls” due to the need for optimizing system calls implementations. The solution needed to not require libc to track CPU capabilities and or the kernel version. Let us take for example x86, which has …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I know this question is probably seen alot here, but I'm a Linux beginner, I know a little about it and have dabled in it a little bit but not much other then a few basic commands.
 I feel like Linux Mint is a bit too basic for me and for what I would like to do. I am interested in learning the Linux terminal to possibly learn a bit of network type stuff.
 I have tried Kali but it is debated wether or not it is recommended due to learning how to installl the apps Kali gives you is advised rather then using Kali as a package if you're interested in the cyber security stuff which is one of my main interests. I have tried Ubuntu but that also seems to not be reccomended anymore. Linux Mint looks very basic and I feel like I wouldnt be able to do everything I want in it.
 Bare in mind I would like to daily drive Linux eventually, and due to ease of use I'd like it to be a Debian based distro.
 UPDATE I didnt write the post very well, Im not dissing mint at all, I just dont think its my kind of OS and I'd like something that skews a bit more away from the windows side of things.

 I've gotten my average draw down to ~8W. On my 65Wh battery this equates to about 8hrs of battery life under light use.
 x86_64 systems only please
 ​
 My setup and tweaks:
 - Arch Linux (also obtained on Mint)
 - Razer Blade 15 (2021 Base)
 - dGPU powered off
 - auto-cpufreq for power optimizations
 ​
 I'd like to get it down to ~5W, but idk if that's feasible. The 7-8W breakpoint appears quite difficult to pass.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello. I want to ask about a specific scenario:
 Lets say I got a flash drive, I wrote 10 files there, deleted 2 of them, so 8 are present at the moment. We know files don't just get deleted, it's just that the OS forgets that they're there and you can always retrieve deleted files unless they're damaged (overwritten).
 My question is, how would I be able to copy all 10 files including 8 present ones and 2 deleted ones from that flash drive to another so that I would be able to recover those 2 deleted ones on the second flash drive?
 My best guess is "rsync -vuar /source/directory /destination/directory" but I don't know if it would be able to copy the deleted ones too. Please tell if that would work and if not, which command should I use instead?

 Dear community,
 I'm Piotr from Customrombay.org, and I would like to bring some exciting news for all Linux enthusiasts.
 Today, support for displaying information about Linux distributions on phones was added to Customrombay.org. Now, you can easily compare the availability of custom Android ROMs, custom recoveries, and Linux distributions between devices.
 What is Customrombay?
 Customrombay is the largest database of custom ROMs, with support for over 550 devices. Our goal is to support as many custom ROMs and devices as possible and provide quality information about them.
 Contributing
 Contributing to Customrombay is highly encouraged, as it helps the project grow. More information is available on the contributing page.
 Open source
 Customrombay.org is completely open source. You can find us on GitHub. Our code is licensed under the MPL-2.0 license.
 Phones with notable Linux support
 For now, only information about Ubuntu Touch support is available on our website. We plan to extend that to PostmarketOS and NixOS. But which devices does Ubuntu Touch support? For example those:
  
OnePlus 6 (enchilada)
 OnePlus 6T (fajita)
 OnePlus One (bacon)
 Xiaomi Poco F1 (beryllium)
 Xiaomi POCO X3 (surya)
 Sony Xperia X (suzu)
 Google Pixel 3a (sargo)
 ASUS Zenfone Max Pro M1 (X00TD)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[ReactOS 项目冒泡表示还活着

ReactOS 是一个开源的操作系统，旨在复制微软的 Windows，可以不加修改地运行许多 Windows 应用程序。ReactOS 的上一次更新是在 2021 年 12 月。此前它的发布计划是每三个月释出一个新版本，但自从 0.4.14 之后就再无动静。面对用户的疑问，该项目发文称其还活着，只是之后的版本发布会根据质量而不是数量。新的发布规则是“一个新版本要达到 `发布’ 状态，需要有合理的低回归量（不超过 20个）”。但他们并没有给出下一个版本预计发布的时间，不过你可以随时尝试其每夜构建版本。


消息来源：ReactOS



老王点评：其实，没事发个新版本表示活着，至少是给社区一些信心的做法。




WhatsApp 关闭了基于 Electron 的桌面应用

当 WhatsApp 处于早期开发阶段时，开发者创建了一个基于 Electron JavaScript 框架的桌面应用程序，它在 Windows 和 macOS 上都能使用。大约四周前，这个桌面应用程序的主屏幕上出现了一个倒计时器，宣布其即将关闭。WhatsApp 让用户切换到其原生应用程序上，新的原生应用程序已经稳定运行了一年左右。


消息来源：Android Police



老王点评：有了原生应用，谁还用 Electron 的呀。




GitHub DDoS 攻击了一个重要的开源项目小网站

一个 GCC 核心的开源算术库 GMP 项目所使用的服务器遭受到了大量的来自 GitHub 的 IP 的连接。无奈之下，该项目只能封禁了数百个微软的 IP 地址。微软发现这是一个被复刻了 700 多次的存储库上的 Actions 工作流导致的。一位 GitHub 用户更新了 FFmpeg-Builds 项目中的一个脚本，该脚本从 gmplib.org 提取内容。这种活动应该不是恶意的，但 GMP 有限的基础设施无法应对这个量级的并发请求。这并不是第一次有软件项目因为繁重的流量需求而喊出被 DDoS。


消息来源：The Register



老王点评：这个事情里面没有主动的恶意行为者，但是 GitHub 这么大体量，稍有不慎对其它微小的基础设施都是毁灭性打击，所以，微软应该对其基础设施和应用更加慎重一些。]]></summary>

WhatsApp 是流行的手机通讯平台，在许多国家都很受欢迎。用户通常通过 Play 商店或 App Store 中的移动应用访问它。然而，WhatsApp 从未推出任何适用于 Linux 的官方桌面客户端。

尽管你可以使用浏览器访问 WhatsApp，这是从任何桌面（包括 Linux）访问消息的官方方式。

一个新的非官方 WhatsApp Flatpak 桌面应用出现了，你可以无缝地使用它进行通信。

那么，这个 GTK 应用有哪些功能？

“Linux 版 WhatsApp” 的功能



借助这款新的桌面应用，Linux 桌面用户可以在他们最喜欢的桌面环境中享受 WhatsApp 的所有熟悉功能。现在，你可以在 Linux 发行版上轻松访问所有功能，例如发送消息、共享媒体文件以及进行语音和视频通话。

“Linux 版 WhatsApp” 应用还提供键盘快捷键，确保应用内的无缝导航和交互。使用此应用，你可以放大和缩小以仔细查看图像和文本，或切换到全屏模式以获得无干扰的聊天体验。该应用还包括一个系统托盘图标，即使在应用最小化时也可以快速访问和通知。

此外，你可以自定义应用以满足你的喜好。通过按 Alt+H，你可以轻松显示或隐藏标题栏，从而更好地控制工作区。该应用还支持系统语言的本地化，确保你可以轻松地与世界各地的朋友和家人进行交流。



Linux 版 WhatsApp 应用的一项值得注意的功能是支持系统语言的拼写检查。要启用此功能，你必须安装相应的词典，例如美国英语的 hunspell-en_us 包。

技术细节

如果你想知道，它不是一个 Electron 应用。它是使用原生 C++ 编写的，确保了最佳的性能和安全性。它依赖于各种免费和开源库，例如 intltool、gtkmm-3.0、webkit2gtk-4.0、ayatana-appindicator3-0.1、libcanberra 以及用于拼写检查的 libhunspell（可选）。

你可以从 GitHub 上的源码了解有关此应用的更多信息。

安装

首先，你必须为你的 Linux 发行版设置 Flatpak 和 Flathub。使用 本指南 来设置。

安装后，运行以下命令进行安装。

flatpak install com.github.eneshecan.WhatsAppForLinux


你可以在应用列表中找到该应用。

运行应用

打开应用后，设置与 WhatsApp 网页类似。打开手机的 WhatsApp 应用并扫描应用中的二维码。这样就完成了。



请注意，这是一个非官方的应用。因此，请谨慎使用。你还可以查看 GitHub 以获取有关此应用的更多详细信息。

九十年前，苏联微生物学家格奥尔基·高斯将零点五克燕麦片放入一百毫升水中，煮十分钟，制成培养基后进行过滤，再加水稀释一同倒入平底试管里，最后将五只草履虫放进试管。一周之中，他观察到草履虫数量在缓慢增长一段时间后开始快速疯狂繁殖，到了第三天，数量达到顶点。然而，随着食物逐渐耗尽，种群数量开始下降直到趋于零。这一年高斯二十四岁，他用不起眼的草履虫发现了至今令人类思索的一条规律：生物会在疯狂生长到充满整个培养皿，以致拥挤到触碰器皿边缘后，开始自我消耗，直至殆尽。
那么，人类是否也与草履虫一样？我们是否已触碰到人类这个物种繁殖量的边缘？如果是，未来应该怎么办？
这精彩的故事和发人深思的追问来自美国作家查尔斯·C. 曼恩的新著《巫师与先知：两种环保科学观如何帮助人类应对生态危机》。作者发挥其科学记者的优势，采访大量专家与学者的同时，还收集了相关领域丰富的科学数据，再结合实际走访，与全世界各地环保主义者、政治家、农业人员和官员面谈，写出了一本难能可贵的环境保护论战史。全书以立场截然不同但又都关心人类前途命运的两位代表人物为线索，通过详细讲述他们的生平与贡献，串联起当今世界环保主义与科学主义人士百年来的探索与困惑。作者将他们归纳为先知派和巫师派。
环保主义与科学主义
先知派的代表威廉·沃格特在我国的知名度一定比不上《寂静的春天》的作者蕾切尔·卡森。但卡森的名著却是受到沃格特《生存之路》一书启发而写就的，尽管两人年龄仅相差五岁。沃格特出生于1902年，是现代环境保护运动基本理念的制定者。他倡导“世界末日环境论”，认为不断增长的人口数量以及不会降低的消费水平最终将压垮地球的生态系统。富裕不是成就，而是不断付出代价的向地球的索取。消减！消减！是他…]]></summary>

S. 艾略特和王尔德等人的观点的精准讨论也使该书具有以“文化”观念为中心的思想史色彩。而伊格尔顿的流畅、恣肆不羁的文风也使阅读带有了另类快感。对我来说，由于同时在阅读弗里茨·斯特恩（Fritz Richard Oskar Stern）的《非自由主义的失败：论现代德国政治文化》（孟钟捷译，商务印书馆，2015年5月），正在思考的是著名的近现代史难题“德国问题”中文化与政治的复杂关系、权力与文化之争、文明与文化之争、从文化政治走向政治文化的路径等议题，因此对伊格尔顿的《论文化》更多关注的是其中文化与政治的论述。在当下的思想与学术场域中，无论我们对伊格尔顿的理论体系及具体论点有何不同看法，他的鲜活与敏锐的批判性气质仍然是很有感染力的。
作者在“序言”中讲了本书的论述方法：鉴于“文化”这个概念的多层次使其很难被高度统一地展开描述，因此他采取的是围绕“文化”这个主题的多侧面论述。从全书内容议题来说，该书第一章首先讨论了“文化”与“文明”在概念、内涵和使用语境等方面的联系与区别。这一部分在我看来非常适合作为文明史与文化史导论课程的开篇语，可以启发学生从一开始就以开阔的观念与语言学视野思考历史叙事体系的建构与核心概念的复杂联系。…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi Folks, 
 I think come from a very uncommon background. I'm an Econ Undergrad that recently got interested in understanding how Linux kernel works. Could someome tell me from where should I start studying? Maybe give me some sort of roadmap. 
 For context, I have some good experience with coding (as a hobby, 3+ years), but mostly python and webdev stuff. I have been studying C and C++, Data Structures and Algos, and I have very basic understanding of Memory, CPU, etc. 
 My goal is to understand how kernel optimizations are made in High Frequency Trading firms.
 ​
 thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So I let me start like this.
 I had an old Lenovo Notebook lay around and I thought about making a bit of use out of it. I wanted to explore new teritories and well make something practical. 
 I'm an old windows veteran (since 3.11) and also early Android (with alt OSs like Cynogen/Lineage) user so i'm not completley new to change of OS and I'm used to tinker around. Also some old Suse and Knoppix as live CD but that's a whole different thing.
 What I want to do is:
 - hook the notebook up to the network
 - let a linux distrubtion be the OS
 - run Jellyfin/Kodi or an alternativ to hook up my quite big digital CD collection into a streaming setup to use it as spotify alternativ 
 So I installed Fedora Server, got PTSD Flashbacks to MS-DOS and said hell no I need an GUI. SO I installed Fedora Workstation.
 Rat Head enters the chat, does what we all know.
 He is the point, I don't want to go away from Microsoft to then Popo love without lubricants by Red Hat.
 I thought about using Mint, I like the Cinamon GUI they use. (I know I could theoretical tinker cinamon onto fedora even I don't know yet how). 
 But I'm not sure how good Mint is for what I want to use it. So.. help. please.
 Thank you for your pation with a beginner.

 today i talk with a friend and we are discussing about the pros and cons of the use of Linux Mint vs Windows.
 He tell me that for him it's not possible to switch to linux, in particular to Mint because is a simple hobby made from some unknow people... and he describe it as a : Hobbyware...
 He concluded with... yo uare doing banking and other sensible work with this OS? I tell... yes!
 And he tell me that i'm mad, and that windows is not very secure, but i'm doing very bad use of my pc because linux mint is not secure (he repeat... it's only an hobby from someone into a garage...)
 You opinion about that?
 Yes in the last three month i'm using linux mint and every day i use it more and more... and i'm very happy.
 I know behind mint there is not a corporate or a company, and this for some people is wrong, some prefer microsoft and apple because the give the feel of "business" = "reliable".
 But it's so bad use a distro like mint for every day pc use?

 Maybe I am mistaken and there is already feature like that but last time i checked there is no such feature.

 How long usually the updates are delayed, from when an application update becomes available in a linux distribution?
 How trusted are the package maintainers in either case? Like, for the distribution packages, there are probably reviews of shipped software to some extent. Flathub can be like Pypy, with many malicious submissions nobody checks. Any random person could upload a package!

I installed the ubuntu server on a usb stick to clear the ssd of a friend and to save his data. I know that stuff like this can be done with any distro, but ubuntu seemed a bit heavy for the simple stuff, which I have used it for. Iam looking for a beginner friendly lightweight distro, which has good community support. It would be nice if it has a clean UI (Iam not a big fan of the look of puppy linux). 
 Additionally Iam looking for a distro that only has a console, like the ubuntu server, but more leightweight. 
 Do you have any reccomendations for the two distros iam looking for?

 RHEL's unique value proposition is being well tested, stable, and standards compliant, with bug fixes delivered ASAP. Red Hat invests lots of money, time, effort to deliver this in RHEL, whereas the RHEL clones don't offer added value beyond being cheaper. I find it hard to argue: 1) any user has a right to a continuous stream of updates, especially where 2) that user is seeking to wipe away any return on Red Hat's investment.
 Second, Red Hat is a business, and we need to stop pretending every FOSS business should be some quasi-public trust. Red Hat should do what's good for Red Ha…]]></summary>

Lately I’ve been playing around on Linux virtual machines (specifically Ubuntu Studio) and I’m seriously thinking of migrating my Asus Zenbook with a. RTX 3080gpu and 32gb of ram over fully to Linux. 
 My main uses for this computer are creating and programming, both which Linux seems to excel at more than windows plus I love the ease of use of Linux. Is there a reason not to switch to Linux? Would I be wasting my hardware? Thanks

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[cowsay 是一个有趣的小型 Linux 命令行实用程序，它有各种使用方式。以下是几个示例。


如果你想的话，Linux 终端可以是一个有趣的地方。

当然，终端一般用在严肃的场合，但你可以使用 有趣的 Linux 命令 来娱乐自己。

cowsay 就是其中之一。它可以在终端上显示一头牛。



cowsay 的一个特点是，如果与其他命令组合使用，它可以用于一些 “严肃的场合”。比如，在共享的 Linux 服务器上使用它来显示 “每日消息”，以供多个用户查看。

听起来有趣吗？是时候喂养安装一个了。

安装 Cowsay

cowsay 是一个受欢迎的工具，它可以在大多数 Linux 发行版的软件仓库中找到。

要在 Debian 和 Ubuntu 系统上安装 cowsay，请打开终端并运行：

sudo apt install cowsay


对于 Fedora，请使用：

sudo dnf install cowsay


在基于 Arch Linux 的发行版中，请使用：

sudo pacman -S cowsay


使用 Cowsay

顾名思义，这是一头以 ASCII 艺术展示的牛，能输出输入的文本。默认情况下，cowsay 提供了几个选项来调整这头 ASCII 牛的外观和样式。

普通的 cowsay

cowsay <文本>


这将在牛讲话的气泡中打印你提供的任何文本。



或者，你可以使用管道重定向，将另一个命令（比如 echo）的输出作为 cowsay 的输入。

echo "Hello" | cowsay


贪婪的牛

这里，牛的眼睛看起来有点贪婪，它是美元符号。

cowsay -g <消息>




使用特殊字符作为眼睛

你可以使用 -e 选项，然后提供你希望作…]]></summary>

After a year of building our product we tried to monetise and failed. Our free users weren’t willing to pay us money for individual reports.

“Additional permissions” are terms that supplement the terms of this License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions. Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall be treated as though they were included in this License...
  
So as long as the additional terms do not conflict with GPL-3, you may add your own terms. In fact, LGPL works like this. LGPL-3 is essentially word-per-word GPL-3 + additional terms which is an exercise of Section 7 of the GPL-3.
 Section 7 makes GPL-3 a modular, base license for other people to adapt with their own terms as long as it is compatible with GPL.
 You will still call your license GPL-3. The additional terms will be placed in a separate file:
  
If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you must place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the additional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating where to find the applicable terms.
  
I can imagine an additional term to combat Red Hat's style paywall to go something like this:
 This program should not be subjected to an agreement that penalizes the licensee from exercising their rights under this license.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[红帽认为 RHEL 克隆品是对开源公司的“真正威胁”

前两天，红帽 宣布 其企业发行版 RHEL 的源代码将只公开发布在 CentOS Stream 上，其直接后果是社区将无法直接获得 RHEL 的精确源代码。这显然给 1:1 复制 RHEL 的下游发行版，如 AlmaLinux、Rocky Linux 等造成了 阻碍。面对社区批评，红帽高管最近撰文反驳，指出对他们愤怒的人“要么来自于那些不愿为生产 RHEL 需要付出的时间、精力和资源付费的人，要么来自那些因为自己的利益而想要重新打包它的人”。他认为 AlmaLinux 等“下游重新构建者没有价值”，“简单地重新打包，并进行原样转售，没有增加任何的价值，还让开源软件的生产变得不可持续”，并且表示，他们“没有义务让重新构建者的工作更加容易”。更严重的是，他还指控这是一种对开源的“威胁”，“如果是仅仅重新构建代码，而不对现有代码增加价值或进行任何修改，对于所有开源公司来说，这才是真正的威胁。这对开源来说是一个真正的威胁，有可能将开源重新变回到只适用于业余爱好者和黑客的活动。”


消息来源：红帽



老王点评：一方面受限于 GPL 而不得不公开源代码，另外一方面又千方百计提高获得源代码的麻烦程度，并反过来指责那些依据 GPL 而获得源代码的人是“威胁” —— 说实话，“威胁”这个词我记得当年微软也这样说过。曾经红帽砍掉 CentOS 项目，而用滚动变化的 CentOS Stream 替代时，我认为这对 RHEL 的发展是有益的，面对很多“误解”，也曾出面帮他们做过一些澄清。但是现在红帽终于图穷匕见，认为从 RHEL 源代码构建的“克隆品”是一个“威胁”。我想说，你利用开源代码构建的 RHEL，没有资格说同样根据许可证获得源代码构建发行版的人是“威胁”！另外，卫 Sir 今天的 撰文 对此做了更深入的剖析，值得一看。




微软考虑将 Windows 转移到云端

在 FTC 诉微软收购动视暴雪听证会上，一份被公开的微软 2022 年 6 月的内部演示文稿中，微软讨论了在 Windows 365 的基础上实现从云端到任何设备的完整 Windows 操作系统串流。Windows 365 是一项将完整版本的 Windows 串流到设备的服务，目前仅提供给商业客户，但微软已经将其深度整合到 Windows 11 中。未来的更新将包括 Windows 365 Boot，它将使 Windows 11 设备在启动时直接登录到云 PC 实例，而不是本地版本的 Windows。


消息来源：The Verge



老王点评：如果 Windows 都变成云端的了，那么是不是 Linux 桌面就有希望变成“第二大”桌面系统了？ 😉




手机跟踪软件 LetMeSpy 称其被黑客窃取了大量信息

LetMeSpy 是一款手机监控应用程序，被用于家长控制或员工监控。这类手机监控应用程序也被称为跟踪软件或配偶软件，通常在未经本人同意或不知情的情况下对某人的手机进行物理访问而植入。一旦被植入，LetMeSpy 就会默默地将手机的短信、通话记录和精确的位置数据上传到其服务器，让植入该应用程序的人能够实时跟踪该人。该公司称，一名黑客窃取了 LetMeSpy 从电子邮件、电话号码和账户上截获的信息。入侵的黑客表示已经夺取了该公司域名的广泛访问权，并暗示他们删除了 LetMeSpy 存储在服务器上的数据库。同一天晚些时候，一份被黑的数据库的副本也出现在网上。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[从商业化工具开始的探索
很久以前，我曾经试图用一个工具整合各种需求，即所谓「All in One」，结果却是让工具内部变得臃肿和笨重，后来还是逐渐放弃了。
现在，我做笔记用的是 Obsidian 和 Notion，任务管理用滴答清单，剪藏管理用 Cubox（都是少数派商店里面的好货）。这样将需求拆解到不同工具之后，很多复杂脚本被现成功能取代，工作确实简单了一些。但相应的代价则是需要在工具之间跳转，而它们的协作缺乏了一些「灵性」。
针对这种问题，市场上出现了许多基于 API 的自动化平台，试图让用户以较低门槛打通不同应用。这其中的行业领先者包括 Zapier 和 IFTTT 等，都是少数派读者耳熟能详的，在少数派上也有不少关的深度教程，例如：
  
经过检索，我发现在 AI 兴起之后，很多这类服务都快速添加了调用 OpenAI API 的功能。但是它们有一个共同的缺点（或者是我自己的缺点……），就是太贵了。可以对比一下此类产品的价格：
产品
                价格
            
Zapier
                免费用户每月 100 次任务。最低升级价格 $20/月，含 750 次任务
            
IFTTT
                免费用户可保存 3 个自动化（Applets）。含有 AI 功能的升级方案升级 $5/月
            
集简云
                免费用户每月 500 次执行。升级一年 ￥1990，每月可执行 1500 次
            
HiFlow（腾讯轻联）
                免费用户每月 1000 次执行。升级一年 ￥980，每月 3000 次
            
原则上，我是非常支持为互联网企业的创新功能付费的，但是日常用户的需求并没有强烈到能支撑这种价格。特别是 Zapier，已经像是「轻奢品」的范畴了。
本文中，我将介绍自己如何搭建开源、可自建的自动化工具 n8n，并演示几个真实用例。在此基础上，我将对用自动化工具辅助工作的未来提出一些展望，以及就个人如何跟进这新的一轮「产业革命」提出些小小看法。
在经历一系列摸索之后，我最终找到了一个可用且免费的替代品——n8n。
n8n 是一个开源的自动化控制台。它具有设计简洁的图形界面，可以非常清晰地展示数据在各种服务之间流动的过程。对于入门用户，n8n 提供了丰富的模板，也有活跃的社区支持。

n8n 提供官方托管服务，定价也不便宜。但得益于开源属性，可以比较方便地在自己的 NAS 或 VPS 上部署，从而不需要任何额外开销。
用 Docker Compose 安装 n8n
n8n 的安装方式有多种选择，我选择的是 Docker Compose 方案，这也是一种比较容易上手的方案。（下面的步骤假定读者掌握基本的终端操作，且已经安装好 Docker。）
[ 编注：我们之前会员文章介绍过的 YunoHost 也可以快速安装 n8n。]

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[本快速教程解释了安装和使用 GNOME Boxes 以及创建虚拟机的步骤，以及一些提示和故障排除。


虚拟化是使用抽象硬件层运行虚拟实例（而不是实际实例）的过程。通俗地说，它允许你同时安装和运行多个操作系统（Linux、Windows）。

虚拟机 是一个模拟操作系统，它运行在另一个操作系统之上，并使用与主机相同的硬件和存储空间。虽然，你可以控制可以分配给虚拟机的共享内存或空间量。

有多种软件可用于创建虚拟机，例如 Virtual Box、KVM、Hyper-V、VMWare player 和 GNOME Boxes。

但老实说，它们中的大多数使用起来都很复杂，有时还不够稳定。GNOME Boxes 是另一个自由开源的软件，它非常易于使用，通过抽象出大量选项让你可以轻松创建和管理虚拟机。

安装 GNOME Boxes

如果你正在运行 Fedora 的 GNOME 定制版，你应该已经安装了它。但是，对于 Ubuntu、Linux Mint、Kubuntu 和其他发行版，你只需运行以下命令即可将其安装到你的系统中。

sudo apt install gnome-boxes


通过 Flatpak

它也可以通过 Flatpak 包获得。我会推荐你使用这个版本。首先，使用 本指南 在系统中安装 Flatpak，然后从终端运行以下命令进行安装。

flatpak install flathub org.gnome.Boxes


使用 GNOME Boxes 创建虚拟机

从应用菜单启动 GNOME Boxes。

要创建虚拟机，你需要要虚拟化的操作系统的镜像（*.ISO）。

你可以从发行版的官方下载页面下载任何操作系统 ISO 镜像。对于本指南，我使用的是 Pop!_OS，这是一个优秀的 Linux 发行版。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[《繁花 : 批注本》，金宇澄著，沈宏非批注，姜庆共排版，长江文艺出版社，2023年6月出版，682页，98.00元

《繁花》出了一个新版。金宇澄著，沈宏非批注，姜庆共排版。排版先生上封面，罕见，但也因此看得出，沈宏非的批注有多激情，搞得姜先生一会让朱色批注在墨色正文间横躺，一会又竖插一个对话框，夹批与侧批齐飞，段批共尾批一色，也算印刷史上无前例的文本。
当然，批注本的好看，还不在皮相。金宇澄不响，沈宏非狂批。沈爷不仅充分展现自己食神本色，遇到“菜泡饭”“虾籽鲞鱼”“烂糊三鲜汤”“糯米双酿团”“西湖莼菜羹”这样的地方美食，立马展现专业知识和个人权威，而且一手一脚提溜进汁水丰富的历史人文，比如拾玖章提到“走油蹄髈”，沈爷先讲了蹄髈做法，又补上花絮：“‘文革’后落实政策，大笔钱财突然从天而降，世面却无车无房无奢侈品可购、无股票可炒，唯有猛吃，鱼翅、鲍鱼登场之前，‘走油蹄髈’‘全鸡全鸭’一度成为发还抄家财物者‘报复社会’之首选，曾有人日进一簋，月余暴卒。”
跟“食”关联度最高的“色”事，沈爷更是手到擒来如数家珍。金爷小说中，让年轻读者略感门槛的是，对五六十年代穿着和时尚的表达，沈爷凭着半个世纪在色相上的造诣，一一圈画，即便我们这种有点阅历的南方读者，亦大开眼界。
小说第六章，梅瑞告诉康总，她妈终于离婚了，在家清理衣服，织锦缎棉袄，罩衫，横贡缎棉袄，灯芯绒裤子，卡其裤子，两用衫，春秋呢大衣，法兰绒短大衣，派克大衣，哔叽长裤，舍维尼长裤，中长纤维两用衫，朝阳格衬衫，泡泡纱裙子，腈纶开司米三翻领，湖绉荷叶滚边裙，蓝棠皮鞋，江青裙，列宁装等等等等，沈宏非都以饕餮的快乐，色色批注。看好了，“斜纹布西服装大翻领”，“中横布带一根，束起来显腰身”，“‘集各朝女服之大成’设计的开襟V字领连衫裙，裙下摆至小腿中部，有使其（如中山装）成为女性‘国服’之意”，而且，这些食色交融的批注和老金的原文辉映成…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[《天赐之日》，[荷兰]高罗佩著，张凌译，上海译文出版社2023年4月出版，184页，45.00元

众所周知，荷兰汉学家高罗佩（Robert Hans van Gulik，1910-1967）以其融中国公案与西方侦探于一体的《大唐狄公案》闻名世界，该系列悬疑小说是以唐代政治家狄仁杰（字怀英，630-700）为主角，作者虚构了他破案、断案的故事。但很少有人知道，1964 年，也即高氏去世前三年，他还出版了《天赐之日》（The Given Day）——一部几乎完全摒弃狄公系列小说创作风格的黑帮犯罪小说，尽管依旧有一个以正压邪的结局和令男主人公心旌摇曳的美女配角，但作者对故事人物、场景、题材、结构等均作了较大创新，正如荷兰小说家与评论家扬威廉（Janwillem Van de Wetering，1931-2008）在“后记”中所云，此书是高罗佩试图将其“荷兰性”与他在远东接触到的禅学调和起来的尝试。至于这一尝试是否成功，众说纷纭、见仁见智。本文意在展现《天赐之日》对狄公系列小说的新变，并进一步剖析高氏离开狄公赐予的舒适圈，涉足一个从未尝试过的新领域的原因。
相较于《大唐狄公案》，《天赐之日》并非探案小说，而是较为典型的西方犯罪小说，一般来讲，犯罪小说的创作宗旨在于塑造社会共同的道德体系，用紧张刺激的阅读体验、推理解谜的思维乐趣和惩恶扬善的正义主题引导人们遵守法律、和谐相处。但《天赐之日》突破了这一传统主旨，意在彰显更高精神层面的超拔。为达到这一目的，高公首先挣脱了狄公的束缚，为《天赐之日》带来了诸多具有鲜明西方性和现代性的新变。
首先是主人公之变。《天赐之日》由唐武周时期的著名政治家狄仁杰变身为前殖民地也即荷属东印度政府官员约翰·亨德里克斯，前者是满腹经纶、清正廉洁、才德卓绝的“斗南一人”；后者则是爪哇某城的地区副主管和巡回法官，二战期间失去妻女及一切的日军战俘，战后身无长物的老…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It all started on my birthday, when my mother gave me a low-end notebook for studying. At first I thought it was unnecessary because I already have a high-end computer, but this innocent wrong gift literally changed my life.
 For being low-end, Windows 10 was running very poorly, and I decided to install Ubuntu just for testing, and man... how freakin awesome Linux is! At first it's kinda hard because you don't even know cd or apt , but the more you try stuff, the more you learn how to do things efficiently, and even more important, you learn how to actually solve problems by yourself.
 Yesterday I changed GNOME for KDE, and holy ****, it's a new world of customization, and I just can't get enough of this feeling of exploring a whole new land. Even when I get frustrated after failing multiple times trying to do something, the thirst for overcoming challenges seems endless!
 I don't know if I'm being crazy for thinking that exploring an OS is thrilling, but I just feel like an 7 years old kid learning how to do things on a computer for the first time, but in a very depth/technical way (at least in my head lol).
 After this awesome experience, I finally decided to go for a computing college, and I just can't thank my mother enough for giving me a shi*** computer lol. I don't know a single person who uses Linux, so I figured I might be better understood here
 tl;dr Linux just set my life course

 k-means is one of the most widely-used algorithms to cluster data. However, it has several limitations: a) it requires the use of L2 distance for efficient clustering, which also b) restricts the data you're clustering to be vectors, and c) doesn't require the means to be datapoints in the dataset.
 Unlike in k-means, the k-medoids problem requires cluster centers to be actual datapoints, which permits greater interpretability of your cluster centers. k-medoids also works better with arbitrary distance metrics, so your clustering can be more robust to outliers if you're …]]></summary>

Endless is an open-source mobile app that curates posts from your favorite websites in one place with a common interface. The application uses custom extractors specifically written for each website. This way you can endlessly scroll through posts and save the ones you like without having to deal with ads.
With the Endless server I am hosting you can also upvote and leave comments on posts without creating an account! With random tokens linked to your actions you basically use your device as your account and undo your actions in the future without spoiling your identity.
I hope to add more extractors in the future. Feel free to install the app and check out the extractors yourself or contribute to the project! I always love to hear your comments and feedback.

        <updated>2023-06-27T16:07:49.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[你在“发行版快闪”中做错了什么？你能做得更好吗？当然可以。在这里，我们告诉你如何做。


“发行版快闪Distro hopping” 是指经常尝试新的 Linux 发行版，以寻找乐趣或找到适合你的完美发行版的习惯。

毕竟，有着 数百种 Linux 发行版，而且时不时就有新的版本出现。你可能会担心错过它们，而去尝试 Linux 社区的最新潮流。

无论你为何这样做，不管你喜欢与否，人们会犯下一些错误，这让“发行版快闪”的体验变得糟糕。

这些错误是什么？让我带你一一了解：

1、不进行备份



嗯，你想要更换发行版，由于过于兴奋，你毫不犹豫就切换了。

但是，如果你没有备份重要的、经常访问的数据，你可能需要重新配置系统和组织你需要的数据。

所以，如果你有备份，无论你做什么，你需要的数据始终可访问，并帮助你在发行版之间快速的跳来跳去。

2、不检查显卡的驱动支持



用户常常忽略发行版与其系统中的显卡的兼容性，而抱怨发行版有问题。

你必须确保你的发行版对你的显卡有开箱即用的支持。

如果你像我一样有一块英伟达显卡，你应该只选择提供带有英伟达支持的 ISO，或在启动菜单中内置了该支持的发行版。

例如，在 Linux Mint 上你需要 安装英伟达驱动。虽然大部分情况下这是一个简单且没什么麻烦的过程，但并不是每个人都愿意为之付出努力。你也可以选择 Pop!_OS 或 Ubuntu，它们默认情况下与英伟达显卡兼容良好。

3、抱有过高期望



没有谁能完美地挑选出你需要和你可能喜欢的东西。

所以，不要听从他人的建议。自己进行研究，选择你想尝试的下一个发行版。

即使你知道你想要什么，也不要期望新的发行版一定会比你当前的发行版更好。各个发行版在许多方面都有所不同。

你的下一个发行版可能解决了你遇到的问题，但也可能会带来你没有…]]></summary>

I usually ask sysadmins to install the "minimal" version, and now we wanna test the cloud images provided by ubuntu. Security and stability-wise, should I consider Debian over Ubuntu? There's a lot of sources saying it's "more stable". Does anyone have any (recent) actual experience with both, running on production critical systems?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[“mm_percpu_wq” is a kernel thread based on a workqueue which is created in the “init_mm_internals” function (https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v6.4-rc5/source/mm/vmstat.c#L2100). It is part of the the statistics management regarding virtual memory (https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v6.4-rc5/source/mm/vmstat.c#L5). An overview diagram of virtual memory is shown below.
 Overall, “mm_percpu_wq” is the worker thread which updates different counters about the virtual memory of a Linux system. It is also called the “vmstat worker” (https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v6.4-rc5/source/mm/vmstat.c#L2021). “vmstat” stands for “Virtual Memory Statistics” which includes information such as: number of free pages, number of mapped pages, number or dirty pages, amount of memory allocated to kernel stacks and more (there are more than 150 different counters).
 The statistics can be read from the file “/proc/vmstat” (https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man5/proc.5.html). This proc entry is created with others (“buddyinfo, “pagetypeinfo” and “zoneinfo”) in the same file in which “mm_percpu_mm” is allocated (https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v6.4-rc5/source/mm/vmstat.c#L2123). We can see the list of the metric counters in the source code (https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v6.4-rc5/source/mm/vmstat.c#L1168).
 As it names suggested the kernel thread is responsible for accumulating the vm events among all CPUs (https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v6.4-rc5/source/mm/vmstat.c#L126). It is done by going over all the “online” CPUs (https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v6.4-rc5/source/mm/vmstat.c#L117).

	upstreamed along with the new kernel API. The new API is going to
	be required in order to implement Vulkan correctly in a bunch of

	don't want to be maintaining support for that interface for another

互联网总是在消亡；多年来它一直在消亡，被那些从网站上转移流量的应用程序或奖励所谓缩短注意力的算法所杀死。但最近几个月，人工智能正在加速扼杀旧互联网。谷歌正试图改变其几十年一成不变的蓝色链接列表；领英使用人工智能来刺激疲劳的用户；Snapchat 和 Instagram 希望机器人能在你的朋友不在时与你交谈；Reddit 的版主们在抗议天价 API；Stack Overflow 的管理员们则在反对人工智能生成的内容；互联网档案馆正在对抗数据刮削者；维基百科正在被人工智能撕碎；聊天机器人们在反刍自己幻想出来的内容。

        <id>https://linux.cn/article-15947-1.html?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss</id>
        <link href="https://linux.cn/article-15947-1.html?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss"/>
        <updated>2023-06-27T07:59:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[以下是在 GNOME 版本的 Fedora 工作站中启用分数缩放的步骤。


分数缩放Fractional Scaling 是一项方便的功能，可让你最大程度地优化 HiDPI 显示器和高分辨率笔记本电脑。通过微调缩放比例，你可以创建平衡良好、既不太大也不太小且美观的桌面显示。虽然通过分辨率设置也可以，但由于操作系统的限制，它们通常符合你的实际情况。

此外，它还允许你增加显示屏上文本和其他 UI 元素的大小，而不会使所有内容显得模糊。如果你有高分辨率显示器并希望使文本更易于阅读，这将很有用。

Ubuntu 20.04 LTS 在 2020 年引入了 100%、125%、150%、175% 和 200% 的分数缩放。它可以在“显示Display”页面下的“设置Settings”中找到。

但在默认 GNOME 桌面的 Fedora 工作站中，只有 100% 和 200% 缩放可用。



如何使用 GNOME 在 Fedora 中启用分数缩放

打开终端窗口（CTRL+ALT+T）。

运行以下命令。此命令在带有 GNOME 的 Fedora 中启用 125%、150% 和 175% 缩放因子。

gsettings set org.gnome.mutter experimental-features "['scale-monitor-framebuffer']"


重启 Fedora。

打开 “设置” 应用，你应该会看到新的缩放因子。



但是，重要的是要注意分数缩放并不总是完美的。某些应用程序可能无法正确缩放。例如，如果应用程序设计不当，非 GTK 应用可能看起来很模糊。

此外，请务必注意，由于 GPU 的渲染工作量更大，分数缩放可能会增加笔记本电脑的功耗。

一些使用说明

根据我的测试，上述命令在 Wayland 中应该是有效的。

如果你不想使用上述命令，但仍想获得类似的体验，那么你可以按照以下步骤操作：

使用 sudo dnf install gnome-tweaks 安装 GNOME “调整Tweaks” 应用。

转到 “字体Fonts” 设置并更改比例因子。

示例：如果你想保持 100% 缩放比例但想要更大的字体，请尝试缩放比例设为 1.1 或 1.2。根据你的需要进行调整。




125%：这是分数缩放的典型值。它将文本大小和 UI 元素增加 25% 而不会使所有内容显得模糊。

150%：对于想要放大文本和其他 UI 元素但又不想增加显示分辨率的人来说，这是一个很好的值。

175%：对于想要使文本和其他 UI 元素变得非常大的人来说，这是一个很好的值。


尝试不同的缩放因子对于找到最适合你的缩放因子至关重要。最佳缩放因子将取决于你的显示器尺寸、视力和偏好。

我希望本指南有所帮助。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have an RTX3060 TI and a Ryzen 5 5600g. Want to get back to Linux from Windows after a gap of 6 years. I hear that Nvidia cards can have issues with the display if you run dual monitors that have variable refresh rates/resolutions (on Wayland). Is this still true?
 ​
 My main monitor is 1440p 144hz but I also use my older 1080P 75hz panel as a secondary display. Are the issues with Nvidia in this case bad enough to warrant a switch to an AMD card? I don't mind getting a new RX 6800XT since they are available for around $500.
 ​
 Any insights would be appreciated.
 ​
 Edit: Forgot all about another major issue. I had to undervolt my GPU and put a custom fan curve on Afterburner to keep temps under 80c. It is a Zotac dual fan with underwhelming cooling. Ambient temps where I live can go as high as 32c in summer. I guess that's another point for an AMD upgrade since apparently, you cannot undervolt NVidia on Linux?

当然，批注本的好看，还不在皮相。金宇澄不响，沈宏非狂批。沈爷不仅充分展现自己食神本色，遇到“菜泡饭”“虾籽鲞鱼”“烂糊三鲜汤”“糯米双酿团”“西湖莼菜羹”这样的地方美食，立马展现专业知识和个人权威，而且一手一脚提溜进汁水丰富的历史人文，比如拾玖章提到“走油蹄髈”，沈爷先讲了蹄髈做法，又补上花絮：“‘文革’后落实政策，大笔钱财突然从天而降，世面却无车无房无奢侈品可购、无股票可炒，唯有猛吃，鱼翅、鲍鱼登场之前，‘走油蹄髈’‘全鸡全鸭’一度成为发还抄家财物者‘报复社会’之首选，曾有人日进一簋，月余暴卒。”
跟“食”关联度最高的“色”事，沈爷更是手到擒来如数家珍。金爷小说中，让年轻读者略感门槛的是，对五六十年代穿着和时尚的表达，沈爷凭着半个世纪在色相上的造诣，一一圈画，即便我们这种有点阅历的南方读者，亦大开眼界。
小说第六章，梅瑞告诉康总，她妈终于离婚了，在家清理衣服，织锦缎棉袄，罩衫，横贡缎棉袄，灯芯绒裤子，卡其裤子，两用衫，春秋呢大衣，法兰绒短大衣，派克大衣，哔叽长裤，舍维尼长裤，中长纤维两用衫，朝阳格衬衫，泡泡纱裙子，腈纶开司米三翻领，湖绉荷叶滚边裙，蓝棠皮鞋，江青裙，列宁装等等等等，沈宏非都以饕餮的快乐，色色批注。看好了，“斜纹布西服装大翻领”，“中横布带一根，束起来显腰身”，“‘集各朝女服之大成’设计的开襟V字领连衫裙，裙下摆至小腿中部，有使其（如中山装）成为女性‘国服’之意”，而且，这些食色交融的批注和老金的原文辉映成…]]></summary>

 So, let's limit my CPU Mhz. Installed sudo pacman -S linux-tools
 First use cpupower frequency-info too find available speeds:
 "available frequency steps: 3.60 GHz, 3.20 GHz, 2.20 GHz"
 Then I set my Ryzem 2600X to 3200 Mhz with the cpupower:
 sudo cpupower frequency-set --max 3200000
 Temperatures came down from 90 to 60 or below, and I was getting 36 fps and now 30 fps. So it is a nice trade off for low temperatures and take care of my cpu.
 You can configure HTOP to show the CPU Mhz and temperature, press F2 and in "Display Options", there is "Also show CPU frequency" and "Also show CPU temperature"

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, I am a Debian user and am looking to build a new system, something solid that'll last a good while. I don't need onboard wifi, which the Z590-A lacks, as I will only be using wired LAN, and I like that it has nice PCI-E slot options (3 x16 and an x4) and can take up to 128 GB (64 would be enough for my needs, though I like having room to go higher if needed.) I have a Radeon RX 6600 XT that I got for a good price a couple months ago but it still waiting to be used until I get everything else to build this system.
 One motherboard that I've come across that appears to meat my criteria is ASUS Prime Z590-A which is LGA 1200, which I found via:
 https://pcpartpicker.com/product/fwVmP6/asus-prime-z590-a-atx-lga1200-motherboard-prime-z590-a
 The problem is I am having a hard time fining good information of how well it might be supported by Debian 12, or Linux in general, so I would really appreciate any insight and guidance, as well as any good alternatives, including AMD boards. I just need similar PCI-E options as above (either multple x16s or one x16 and some x4 and/or x8 slots - I will only be running the one graphics card so one x16 is needed for that, I need other slots for a capture card and other hardware that are mainly x4 max.)
 Thanks.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[通常，我用的是基于 Ubuntu 的发行版进行工作，如 Pop!_OS、Zorin OS、Linux Mint 或 Ubuntu 本身。

它们不会干扰我的工作，同时又提供了顺滑的软件更新。更不用说，它们与我使用的英特尔-英伟达系统相容性良好。

所有的一切（可能是主观的）都能开箱即用。

然而，最近我决定在实体机上切换到 Arch Linux（我大部分时间都是在虚拟机上使用它）。

结果，我最终选择使用了 Manjaro Linux（一款基于 Arch 的发行版）。

我选择 Manjaro Linux 的原因

令我惊讶的是，即使是使用 Arch Linux 的立付 USB，我甚至无法解决 “nouveau DRM: core notifier timeout” 错误，更别提继续安装了。是的，我知道有向导式的 Arch Linux 安装程序，但是不论怎么样，连接的显示器都会闪烁并突出显示这个错误。

解决这个问题的最好办法是不使用我的最近刚刚升级的英伟达显卡。

很遗憾，我更喜欢英伟达的显卡……

AMD 的 RX 6600 XT 的价格与 RTX 3060 Ti 相当；对于 1440p 来说，购买那款显卡是没有意义的。

因此，在我这个情况下，RTX 3060 Ti 可能是问题所在。

虽然我找到了一些解决问题的方法，但是我太懒了。我只是想看看能否在不用付出太多努力的情况下体验一下 Arch Linux。

所以，我做了以下的事情：

下一个最佳选择就是尝试任何一个专门简化了麻烦的 最佳的基于 Arch 的发行版，对吧？

这就是 Manjaro Linux 登场的地方。

Manjaro Linux 是一款流行的基于 Arch 的发行版，并且我注意到每次更新时都有各种改进（在虚拟机上使用时）。

此外，我喜欢 Manjaro 默认主题…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[民国时期，晚明文人张岱（1597-1689？）的文章著述颇受读书界的重视，其中以周作人（1885-1967）为核心的文人群体为最著。当前学界对张岱民国时期接受史的研究多聚焦于周作人及其弟子——整理出版《陶庵梦忆》的俞平伯（1900-1990），而对另一位与《西湖梦寻》《琅嬛文集》关系颇为密切的苦雨斋弟子沈启无（1902-1969）关注相对不足，笔者因撰小文，略述细节，聊备掌故。
一、缘起《近代散文抄》
沈启无对张岱的接受与推崇，盖与周作人有关。1927年4月，朴社重刊本《陶庵梦忆》面世，该本系据清咸丰间《粤雅堂丛书》刊本整理。周作人为此本作序云：“他（引按：张岱）所选的《一卷冰雪文》曾在大路的旧书店中见过，因索价太昂未曾买得。”大抵是有鉴于此，沈启无于1930年9月编定的明清散文小品选本即以《冰雪小品》名之。该书起初因故未刊，1932年9月改名《近代散文抄》由北平人文书店出版。书中选录张岱散文二十八篇，为入选诸家之最。
沈启无编选《近代散文抄》时亦受周作人影响颇著，尤其是编选张岱散文的过程大抵可考。今按《近代散文抄》书末“抄撮书目”即载有“《张子诗文粃》二十三卷”“《琅嬛文集》十六卷”。其中“《张子诗文粃》二十三卷”系鄞马廉（字隅卿）旧藏清稿本《琅嬛文集》二十三卷十二册，分为《张子文粃》十八卷八册，《张子诗粃》五卷四册（下简称“清稿本”。按马廉《不登大雅文库书目》著录《张子诗粃》为四卷，盖第五卷残损过甚故），今藏国家图书馆（索书号：A01784）。该本为套格纸抄本，版心下方镌“凤嬉堂”，页眉行间有王雨谦评语。

国家图书馆藏清稿本《琅嬛文集·张子诗粃》书影

至于所谓“《琅嬛文集》十六卷”，北京师范大学图书馆杨健先生撰《周作人校藏本〈琅嬛文集〉略考》（载于《鲁迅研究月刊》2018年第1期）指出其中的“《琅嬛文集》十六卷”即周作人旧藏清光绪刊本六卷（下简称“刊本”），此处“十…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Red Hat's Mike McGrath responds
to the many criticisms aimed at the company since it changed its policy
regarding RHEL source code.


	Ultimately, we do not find value in a RHEL rebuild and we are not
	under any obligation to make things easier for rebuilders; this is
	our call to make. That brings me to CentOS Stream, of which there
	is immense confusion. I acknowledge that this is a change in a
	longstanding tradition where we went above and beyond, and change
	like this can cause some confusion. That confusion manifested as
	accusations about us going closed-source and about alleged GPL
	violations. There is CentOS Stream the binary deliverable, and
	CentOS Stream the source repository. The CentOS Stream
	gitlab source is where we build RHEL releases, in the open for
	all to see. To call RHEL “closed source” is categorically untrue
	and inaccurate. CentOS Stream moves faster than RHEL, so it might
	not be on HEAD, but the code is there. If you can’t find it, it’s a

I'm wondering what sort of programs I'm missing out on by being on Linux. I know Adobe has been a problem, but is there anything else? Is there some page or something with info on this? Basically, I'm trying to figure out what complications I could run into in the future in regards to software compatibility.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[today is my 32nd birthday. and before I get to my question I want to quickly talk about myself. I have a micro-enterprise which sells Linux/digital security courses etc. I also have a youtube channel that talks about linux with more than 30k subscribers which generates me a small income of 120 dolars.
 I work remotely from home and this is how I keep my self, my wife and 4 kids.
 I need suggestions and tips for my first job in the sysadmin area. I have a good experience with linux and I've been a user since 2005, I've always been a lot of tinkering and I use distributions like gentoo/slackware. I have good knowledge in Shell Scripts and backup schemes. I keep some VPS with Debian/Centos (deceased)/Slackware with the most varied services like moodle, irc, libreddit, email (postfix), tor, elog and anything else that comes to mind.
 And today on my birthday I woke up very determined to work in the area (for real). A lot, I love this area, I love the command line, I love configuration files. Some details: * I am fully self-taught * I don't have college * I have several courses on udemy (I don't know if it helps) * I'm autistic, and linux is my hyperfocus since 2005, I love it deeply. * I like to write documentation and organize scripts etc...
 A peculiar detail is that, as I am autistic, I cannot work outside the home, that is, it needs to be remotely because I cannot go out and be locked up somewhere (I have panic attacks)
 english Well, what would be your tip to put on my resume?
 I am Brazilian.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey Reddit community,
 I'm in a dilemma and need your advice. I'm looking for a Linux distribution that prioritizes bug fixes and provides quick security updates without focusing too much on additional features. After some research, I've narrowed down my options to Fedora and Ubuntu LTS, but I'm having trouble deciding which one would be the better choice.
 On one hand, Fedora is known for its cutting-edge nature and frequent updates, which could potentially mean faster bug fixes and security patches. However, the rapid pace of development may also introduce new bugs or stability issues.
 On the other hand, Ubuntu LTS (Long Term Support) versions are designed to provide a stable and reliable experience over an extended period. They prioritize bug fixes and security updates while minimizing major changes, making them ideal for users who value stability.
 Considering my primary focus on bug fixes and quick security updates, which distribution do you think would be the better choice for me? Have you had any personal experiences with either Fedora or Ubuntu LTS regarding their maintenance and support?
 I appreciate any insights, opinions, or personal experiences you can share to help me make an informed decision. Thanks in advance!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I worked on a web service that allows you to import a song and define a target length that the song will be shortened or lengthened to. It does this by analyzing the song and finding repeating audio patterns. This is helpful for making any song match a video or performance with a set duration. You can also specify areas of the song to prefer or avoid. An example is available here: https://mofi.loud.red/edit/8bd3fdf780f8c3927e41029f3b957f8a7...
The cool thing is that after the song is analyzed on the server, the client can recompute and preview the results completely client-side through an implementation that uses Web Workers and WebAssembly. The audio previewing uses Tone.js. I am thinking of writing up some more details about the implementation in the future.
I'm still working on a way to explain this easily, but I like the idea of carrying over the concept of content-aware fill from images to audio.
Please let me know if you have any comments or questions!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[中国论文贡献度首次超越美国

《自然》杂志分析了 2022 年全球知名科学期刊论文的各国贡献度，结果显示，中国首次超越美国登上榜首。该排行榜依据论文作者及所属机构的“自然指数”汇总进行排名。对于《自然》、《科学》等 82 种期刊的自然科学领域论文，计算作者所属机构所在国的比例，把总和作为贡献度进行比较，结果显示中国排名第一。美国、德国、英国、日本等分列第二到第五。而从包括大学在内的研究机构来看，前十有六家来自中国，中国科学院居首。


消息来源：《自然》



老王点评：看起来可喜可贺，但是我们的基础科学研究还不够强，还需要继续努力。




英伟达最新 GPU 黑市价格翻番

去年，美国商务部阻止了包括英伟达和 AMD 在内的美国顶级硬件公司向中国和俄罗斯出售其最先进的芯片。其中，英伟达的 A100 和 H100 GPU 属于出口管制的对象。这导致这些芯片在黑市的价格达到了 2 万美元，比正常价格高一倍，并且没有保修和支持。


消息来源：The Register



老王点评：现在 AI 对 GPU 的需求非常迫切，这可比挖矿那时候对 GPU 的需求更紧迫。




NFC 将变得更强

负责制定近场通讯规范的 NFC 论坛公布了到 2028 年的主要计划和研究工作。主要的五个方面包括：NFC 无线充电的功率将从 1 瓦提升到 3 瓦；连接范围将从 5 毫米提升四到六倍；支持多用途轻触；使支持 NFC 手机具有 POS 功能；能够分享其成分和产品回收方式的数据。


消息来源：The Register



老王点评：虽然要几年才能落地，但我总觉得 NFC 变强也带来更多风险，比如近场通讯的距离变得更远，盗刷风险就大了。]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Apologies but asking here as /r/linuxquestions is still locked.
 I work for a private ISP, we sell managed networks to customers with various services. I have a VMware ESXi server, and to simplify things let's say it currently has 10 VMs, each VM having a management NIC, and a customer VLAN NIC. Currently I can use a service like NRPE to execute commands on each VM, and NRPE runs a networking command (like a cURL, ping, or similar) over the customer network NIC. The NRPE agent listens on the management NIC, but executes the commands over the customer VLAN NIC.
 Customer wise, for simplicity we'll say customers are called Customer1, Customer2, Customer3, and so on. Their VLANs correspond like 10, 20, 30, and so on. Each customer network has an identical IP space of 10.0.0.0/8, and the IP of this VM will be identical in each of the networks.
 I'm building a new VM which has a single management NIC, and a single trunk NIC (VLAN 4095 in VMware parlance). I've tested configuring the secondary NIC on the VM as Customer1 with VLAN 10 tagged, and that works fine (so the port is all good), but I'm having trouble with network namespaces. My end goal is to be able to run commands like ip netns exec customer1 ping 8.8.8.8 and get the results (quick crap example, but you get the idea).
 I tried to borrow the principles from this article but it wouldn't work for me. 
 Update: Now resolved thanks to /u/J4yD4n suggestion of splitting the trunk interface in to separate per-VLAN subints and then attaching namespaces to them individually.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[开发人员可以通过将开源软件集成到其代码库中，节省时间并避免重复发明轮子。然而，这也带来了严重的许可侵权风险。你必须遵守适用于重新使用的开源代码的众多开源许可证之一。如果你不这样做，你（或你所在公司）有可能因违反开源许可证条款而被起诉。即使这种诉讼并不普遍发生，它们确实存在。实际上，考虑到现在许多开源项目由希望保护其在开源社区中的投资的企业运营，这种情况在未来可能更加频繁发生。

1、熟悉开源许可证

了解开源许可证是防止开源许可侵权问题中最重要的一步。很容易认为所有开源许可证都施加相同的条件，或者它们都基本要求源代码的持续可用性。实际上，有数十种不同的开源许可证，它们都有着非常不同的条款。简单地认为只要你从一个开源项目获取代码，你可以随意使用它并保持源代码可访问，这是一个严重的错误。几个开源许可证的一个典型但经常被忽视的条件可能是需要向原始作者提供致谢。

2、记录你使用的开源内容

建立一个标准化的方法来记录你使用开源代码的情况是一个优秀的做法。导入模块或从 GitHub 粘贴代码并不难。但如果你不追踪代码来自何处以及使用了何种许可证，你可能会忘记在代码库中如何以及在哪里集成开源内容。此外，如果你在借用代码时无法证明自己遵守了有效的许可条件，那么在开源许可证发生变化时可能会产生问题。考虑在文档维基（如果有的话）中添加一个页面，列出你使用的开源代码，以避免出现这个问题。每当你包含开源组件或依赖时，至少在你自己的源代码中添加注释。

3、避免使用未经授权的开源组件

有时，你可能会偶然发现一个隐藏的 GitHub 存储库或其他源代码托管位置，其中包含你希望使用的代码，但没有提到任何许可指南。你可能会认为代码的创建者希望让其成为开源代码，并且你可以根据自己的意愿使用它。但这是一个危险的假设。开发人员可能会后续对代码设置特定的许可条件，并要求你遵守这些条件，这可能导致未来产生许可侵权的指控。除非你有非常充分的理由，否则避免使用缺乏明确许可限制的模糊代码。

4、创建自己的开源代码

将你自己的软件完全开源是减少与开源许可相关风险的一种方法。这意味着你将自动遵守任何要求保留派生源代码的开源许可条件。然而，请记住，仅仅开放你自己的代码并不能确保完全遵守许可证。你仍然需要努力确保你遵守每个许可证的规定，因为适用于你借用的代码的许可证可能与你选择的开源许可证不同。然而，你无需担心与源代码共享相关的任何条款。

5、自动检测开源组件

虽然在代码库内手动跟踪你如何使用开源是很好的做法，但通过使用能够自动识别开源组件和依赖项的软件，你可以降低出错的可能性。在这里，我们应该考虑两种不同类型的工具。一种是源代码组成分析（SCA）软件，它会自动扫描源代码并识别从值得信任的外部来源获取的元素。另一种是软件供应链管理解决方案，除其他功能外，还支持查找和监控应用程序堆栈中的任何开源依赖项。

API 网关是一个单一节点，提供对 API 调用入口。网关聚合了所请求的服务，并相应传回合适的响应信息。为了令你的 API 网关有效地工作，设计一个可靠、高效且简洁地 API 至关重要。本文介绍一种设计风格，但只要你理解其中的重点内容，它就能解决你的相关问题。

由 API 主导的方法

API 主导的方法是将 API 置于应用程序和它们需要访问的业务能力之间的通信核心，从而在所有数字通道上一致地交付无缝功能。API 主导的连接是指使用一种可重用、且设计得当的 API 来连接数据和应用程序的方法。

API 主导的架构

API 主导的架构是一种架构方法，它着眼于实现重用 API 的最佳方式。它能解决以下问题：


保护 API，使外界无法在未授权情况下访问 API

确保应用程序能找到正确的 API 端点

限制对 API 的请求次数，从而确保持续的可用性

支持持续集成、测试、生命周期管理、监控、运维等等

防止错误在栈间传播

对 API 的实时监测和分析

实现可伸缩和灵活的业务能力（例如支持 微服务 架构）


API 资源路由

实现一个 API 网关，把它作为与所有服务通信的单一入口点，意味着使用者只需要知道 URL 就能使用 API。将请求路由到相应的服务端点，并执行相应的功能是 API 网关的职责。



由于客户端应用程序不需要从多个 HTTP 端点调用功能，这个办法就减少了 API 使用者的操作复杂度。对每个服务来说，也不需实现一个单独的层级去实现认证、授权、节流和速度限制。大多数API 网关，如开源的 Apache APISIX，已经包含了这些核心功能。

API 基于内容的路由

基于内容的路由机制也使用 API 网关根据请求的内容进行路由调用。…]]></summary>

春天时，听完了杰森·萨默的《什穆尔的桥：跟随我的幸存者父亲回访奥斯维辛》的有声书。再读实体书时，已是初秋。
新冠的第三个夏天太美丽，忙着旅行、享用花草瓜果，不宜也不应该阅读这样严肃、凝重的书。疫情虽然没有结束，但世界上大部分地区的人们都恢复了从前夏天的活动。最明显的，便是旅行。回故乡，或是就地重逢，或是前往陌生的远方。旅行，是人们制造或者寻找记忆的地方。
然而，一进9月，天气转凉，空气似乎也便凝重了起来。9月18日，美国公共广播电台（PBS）上播出了知名纪录片制作人肯·伯恩斯的纪录片《美国和大屠杀》（United States and the Holocaust），三集，六个小时。九·一八，中国人自然会想起“从那个悲惨的时候”。
记住回忆。
大屠杀：读不完的书，看不完的电影
第一次接触大屠杀题材，看的是梅丽尔·斯特里普主演的四集电视剧《大屠杀》。那之后不久，在长江航船上读到了《安妮·弗兰克日记》。在美国读书期间，去欧洲参加过一次上海前犹太居民的会议，从那次会议上，第一次听幸存者的后代说，他们很多人没有见过自己的祖父母。“大屠杀”这个题目，一下子具体化了，变成了家族树上断裂的链条。
以色列作家阿摩司·奥兹在他的回忆录《爱与黑暗的故事》(A Tale of Love and Darkness)中，生动地描写了母亲的出生地，位于乌克兰境内的罗夫诺，却一直不愿意前往访问。后来，他的女儿范尼亚·奥兹代他前往。他的小说《轻抚水，轻抚风》（Touch the Water, Touch the Wind），对在德国文化中侵染多年，却一夜之间沦为流亡者，在黑暗的森林中藏匿逃生的犹太青年充满了温柔的同情。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[《吴趣：沈周绘画与文官鉴藏》，秦晓磊著，上海书画出版社2022年10月出版，262页，88.00元

沈周（1427-1509）作为吴门画派的领袖名闻于当时，“评者谓为明世第一”（《明史》卷二九八）；但他不仅是画家，也是隐士，既不参加科考，亦拒绝征召，终生未仕。与传统的离群索居、遗世高蹈的隐者形象不同，沈周一生雅集不断，应酬频繁，弟子文徵明在《沈先生行状》中记载：“晚岁名益盛，客至亦益多，户屦常满。先生既老，而聪明不衰，酬对终日，不少厌怠。风流文物，照映一时。”（《甫田集》卷二十五）沈周隐居的有竹居，不像安静的世外桃源，更似热闹的文化中心，“每黎明，门未辟，舟已塞乎其港矣。先生固喜客，至则相与䜩笑咏歌，出古图书器物，摸抚品题，酬对终日不厌”（王鏊《石田先生墓志铭》）。沈周的交游对象，当然也不仅仅是布衣山人、方外僧道，各种地方官员乃至馆阁诸公，都与其过从甚密。虽然沈周自称“酷爱林泉图上见，生憎官府酒边谈”（《市隐》），但他并不排斥政治，回避官员，甚至主动与官员交接。当下的研究者几乎都注意到了这一点，认为沈周与官宦的交往对提高其声誉、传播其作品起了重要作用。但是这种交游是如何影响沈周在美术与文学上的具体创作，在吴门画派的崛起过程中又有何作用？涉及者尚寥寥无几。

沈周《沧洲趣图》卷（局部）

沈周作为吴门画派创始人，是美术界关注的热点，仅在“中国知网”数据库中以“沈周”为标题进行检索，近十年（2012-2022）来平均每年都有三十篇以上的论文发布，其中秦晓磊博士先后发表的《与邑作奇观——沈周、文徵明笔下的虞山古桧》（《故宫博物院学刊》2018年第2期）、《李东阳对沈周绘画的鉴藏——兼论北京文官与沈周的互动》（《中国国家博物馆馆刊》2018年第7期）、《沈周〈庐墓图〉与茔域山水画》（《文艺研究》2018年第11期）、《沈周〈沧洲趣图〉的意涵、年代及接受者》（《美术》2019年第6…]]></summary>

 I’m aware I can write a sh script that loops over the session names as the arguments (eg. for session in $@), BUT the problem is this doesn’t allow for Tab autocompletion of the session name. Since my session names are pretty long/specific , having this would be super helpful.
 Any thoughts on how to resolve this are appreciated. Thank you!

 I tried to log into Chase.com, and saw it gave me a "we've enhanced our platform" error on ARM when it allows x86 Linux fine. I called Chase and they said to "call a Geek Squad" or "call Apple" while claiming "we can't do anything", basically blaming Apple. As if Apple is responsible for Debian's Asahi remix and Firefox on ARM Linux. I fought them and they said "OK, we can send it to our analysts to check".
 Yes, Apple is responsible for making hardware and not releasing FOSS drivers. Apple isn't responsible for Chase allowing x86 Linux but n…]]></summary>

	Most of the stuff in my mailbox the last week has been about
	upcoming things for 6.5, and I already have 15 pull requests
	pending. I appreciate all you proactive people.

	But that's for tomorrow. Today we're all busy build-testing the
	newest kernel release, and checking that it's all good. Right?


Headline features in this release include:
generic iterators for BPF,
the removal of the SELinux runtime disable
knob,
the removal of the SLOB memory allocator,
linear address masking support on Intel
CPUs,
process-level samepage merging control,
support for user trace events,
more infrastructure for writing kernel modules in Rust,
per-VMA locks,
and much more.
See the LWN merge-window summaries (part 1, part 2), and the (in-progress) KernelNewbies 6.4 page for
the details.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When watching a live stream on youtube you can watch current events, or rewind to the past to watch what has happened 1,5 hour ago.
 I want to setup a home monitoring service. I want a similar service, for myself, on my own server with public IP. I know Linux. I have a raspberrypi connected to network that I want to stream video from home to my server.
 I looked into "restreamer", but I think it streams a stream to other services only and has no history. Right now, I try to setup "avideo" (or "youphptube") inside ubuntu docker container with mixed success.
 Is there an application to allow presenting a video stream via a web page (or anything else that will work on android) with the functionality of rewinding to the past and recording everything to a directory?
 If I understand, when I set up nginx with rtmp it can stream the stream. And the stream is recorded to a directory. But to watch "what has happened 2 hours ago" I have to open the directory where the stream is recorded and download a file and watch it. I want it to work like youtube. Just click 2 hours ago on the video. How do I do that?
 Thanks.

 I'm having a bit of an issue with Plymouth. I'm running the code below for a theme, however scaling the images seem to make the whole script lag really bad. 
 There isn't much documentation available so I'm not sure what I'm doing wrong or why scaling these images would make it lag. As I understand it it only scales them once per image then is plays them but maybe I'm wrong, I don't know. 
 ```
 Window.SetBackgroundTopColor(0.234, 0.43, 0.705); Window.SetBackgroundBottomColor(0.16, 0.25, 0.44);
 window_width = Window.GetWidth(); window_height = Window.GetHeight();
 intro_index = 0; load_index = 0; max_intro = 37; max_load = 20;
 index = 0; while (1){ intro[index] = Image("IntroAnim" + index + ".png"); intro[index].Scale(window_width, window_height); if (index > max_intro) break; index++; }
 index = 0; while (1){ load[index] = Image("LoadAnim" + index + ".png"); load[index].Scale(window_width, window_height); if (index > max_load) break; index++; }
 sprite = Sprite();
 fun refresh (){ if (intro_index <= max_intro) { sprite.SetImage(intro[intro_index]); } if (intro_index > max_intro) { sprite.SetImage(load[load_index]); } intro_index++; load_index = (load_index + 1) % max_load; }
 Plymouth.SetRefreshFunction (refresh);

 Logging in using sddm or any other DM, both monitors flicker for maybe half a second.
 Starting an application from the launcher, nothing happens. Switch to terminal to see what's up. Solved in a couple of google searches. 
 And some more little tiny annoyances.
 It's nothing, basically. I love Linux, everything works. But the experience just isn't smooth. Everything "works". 
 Will those annoyances go away if I use Debian or OpenSUSE Leap? Maybe you can tell. To me there's always some thing I have to fix. Maybe that's why I love Linux.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey HN, I didn't want my Gateway 4DX2-66 from 1993 to be left out of the AI revolution, so I built an AI Assistant for Windows 3.1, based on the OpenAI API.
The most interesting parts of building this were:
- Getting TLS 1.2 and 1.3 working on Windows 3.1 so that WinGPT could directly connect to OpenAI's server without relying on a modern machine for TLS termination.
- Learning about the memory segmentation architecture on 16-bit Windows, including the difference between far and near pointers.
- Building the UI in plain C code with the Windows API and limited selection of controls in Windows 3.1.
You can check it out here and learn more about what it was like to build it: https://www.dialup.net/wingpt/

 Let's be honest, one of the most common complaints i see about snaps other than load times are the fact that there's only one repository to pull packages from. And that's more than often commonly listed as the sole reason why flatpaks are "apparently" better.
 So why is it that flathub is the only repo that's list in every distro's documentation to enable? ArchwikiDebianGentoo
 In fact, it's also the only repo I see that has applications added to it. here's the breakdown on numbers. First here's how to find this pout yourself so lets enable the big three repo's that I've come across from stalking /r/flatpak

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi HN, I recently created and published an open-source resume builder as a weekend project. The idea came to me while I was mentoring students and noticing common mistakes they made in their resumes that I had also made in the past. I thought to build a tool to help people easily create a modern professional resume with built-in best practices to avoid those mistakes.
Top highlights of the resume builder are:
1. Real time UI update as you type
2. ATS friendly to top ATS platforms, e.g. Greenhouse, Lever
3. Privacy focus - no sign up is required and data is stored locally in browser that only users have access
4. Support import from existing resume PDF
The tool also includes a resume parser to help people test their existing resumes’ ATS readability if they might not be interested in using the builder. I also explained the parser algorithm in an article with interactive tables that might be an interesting read to see the steps and logics it uses (https://www.open-resume.com/resume-parser).
I hope others might find this tool useful and I look forward to hearing any feedback the community has. Thanks all.

The automoderator bot has been deactivated. Reporting is useless, so it's basically the same as clicking the hide button.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[数百万 GitHub 项目易受依赖库劫持攻击

安全专家发现，数以百万计的 GitHub 项目易受依赖库劫持攻击，攻击者可以借此发动影响大量用户的供应链攻击。GitHub 上的用户名和项目或库的名字如果改变，为了避免破坏其它项目的依赖关系，GitHub 会创建一个重定向。但如果有人用旧的名字创建了账号，那么就会导致重定向无效。GitHub 可以防御部分此类攻击，但该防御方案可以被绕过。


消息来源：Aqua Sec



老王点评：我觉得 GitHub 应该更认真的解决这个问题，毕竟 GitHub 已经不仅仅是一个代码仓库，而是一个供应链的重要组成部分了。但从另外一个角度看，软件项目依赖这种不确定的供应链是不是也过于宽松了？




美国新数据显示，在家工作成为新常态

许多在大流行期间蜷缩在家里的白领工人已经回到办公室，但没有回到办公室的人特别多。对许多人来说，远程工作似乎是一种新常态。周四公布的美国经济数据显示，在家工作似乎已经成为一种趋势，特别是对女性和受过大学教育的人而言。2022 年的数据显示，34% 的 15 岁以上的人仍然在家里工作，54% 的人拥有学士或更高的学位。而美国旧金山市长已经 提议 将市中心荒废的购物中心改造为足球场，因为越来越多人不再回到市中心上班，旧金山的办公室空置率已达到 30 年来的最高水平。


消息来源：MSN



老王点评：不知道为什么美国人就不回去上班了，而我们似乎都赶紧回去了。




Firewalld 2.0 发布

开源防火墙守护程序 Firewalld 自 2011 年以来一直在开发，而两年前才达到 Firewalld 1.0 的里程碑。因此，发现 Firewalld 2.0 在今天发布有点令人惊讶。2.0 中最重要的变化解决了区域漂移的问题，即防火墙策略可能最终违反了 “数据包只进入一个区域” 的规则。此外，还增加了对 NFTables Flowtable 的支持，可以显著提高转发性能，将网络转发的 iperf 性能提高了约 59%。


消息来源：Phoronix



老王点评：看起来是 Firewalld 的开发在加速，不过我更觉得它是在飙版本号。看看 Firefox、Linux 内核等开源软件的版本号，看来开源软件对版本号的谦虚传统已经被丢弃了。]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[在本文中，我们将逐步向你展示如何在 Kubernetes（k8s）集群上安装 Ansible AWX。


Ansible AWX 是一个强大的开源工具，用于管理和自动化 IT 基础设施。AWX 为 Ansible 提供图形用户界面，使你可以轻松创建、安排和运行 Ansible 剧本Playbook。

另一方面，Kubernetes 是一种流行的容器编排平台，广泛用于部署和管理容器化应用。

先决条件：


Kubernetes 集群

Kubectl

具有 sudo 权限和集群管理员权限的普通用户

互联网连接


步骤 1：安装 Helm

如果你的系统上安装了 Helm，则在命令下运行以进行安装，

$ curl -fsSL -o get_helm.sh https://raw.githubusercontent.com/helm/helm/main/scripts/get-helm-3
$ chmod +x get_helm.sh
$ ./get_helm.sh
$ helm version




步骤 2：安装 AWX chart

在 Kubernetes 上安装 AWX 的最简单方法是使用 AWX Helm “海图chart”。因此，要通过 “海图” 安装 AWX，首先使用以下 helm 命令添加仓库。（LCTT 译注：Kubernetes 生态中大量使用了和航海有关的比喻，因此本文在翻译时也采用了这些比喻）

$ helm repo add awx-operator https://ansible.github.io/awx-operator/
"awx-operator" has been added to your repositories
$


注意：如果你之前已经添加过此仓库，请在命令下运行以…]]></summary>

加布里埃尔·伊根（Gabriel Egan）先生是英国德蒙福特大学教授、国际知名莎学专家，也是《新版牛津莎士比亚全集》的四位总编辑之一。《全集》前四卷已出版，分别是《现代评论版》《研究参考版》（两卷）和《作者身份溯源》；后两卷是《剧目别本》，将在2023-2024年出版。杨英军先生应《上海书评》之邀，借莎翁第一对开本出版四百年之机采访了伊根教授，请他谈了《新版牛津莎士比亚全集》的编纂及莎学研究的最新进展。

《新版牛津莎士比亚全集》书影

作为《新版牛津莎士比亚全集》（The New Oxford Shakespeare Complete Works）的四位总编辑之一，您已经付出了十多年的心血。您能跟读者分享一下最新进展吗？《全集》能否按计划在2023年完成？

整套《全集》一共六卷，我们已经出版了四卷。第一卷是《全集：现代评论版》（The New Oxford Shakespeare: Modern Critical Edition）。这是面向二十一世纪读者的全集，我们对文本全部做了规范化的处理，以满足当代读者的期待，主要是将莎士比亚时代的拼写和标点符号加以校勘和更新，其中的表演选项提示（Performance Notes）是我们的创新，目标是帮助演员更好地呈现莎剧的艺术完整性。更多的注释是为了帮助读者更好地欣赏其中的戏剧和诗歌。

 And I'm not switching to the garbage that is Windows 10, and especially not Windows 10 the sequel, aka 11.
 The problem why I never used Linux for gaming, is that most of my ancient games from the 90s, early 2000s just won't run on any Linux distro I tried. To be fair most of them barely run on Windows 7 but I can make it work with some fiddling. And I want my new rig to run everything, so I don't need two seperate PCs for running different eras of games.
 But that was years ago when I last tried it, maybe there are some improvements made to run old Windows software? Plus points if a distro has a super outdated UI and looks ancient.

 InkBox OS is a fully-functional operating system for some Kobo and Kindle eReader devices. It has pretty much been built from scratch, except for the base system which consists of Alpine Linux 3.10 (the reason why we use such an old version is because not all devices run a recent enough kernel to handle libc that weren't built for them). Most of the scripts, system initialization and graphical user interface programs were written from the ground up, though.
 I hope that you will enjoy it if you are able to try it!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Working from a personal PC has the downside of being responsible for its availability, regardless of what happens, as well as ensuring its safety against any invasion. Currently, my approach is as follows:
 ​
  
Having a Linux PC for work.
 
Using separate email accounts for different purposes.
 
Using secure passwords for each account.
 
Using one browser for confidential tasks and another for non-confidential tasks.
 
Avoiding logging in with confidential emails on unsafe devices.
 
Never saving or copying passwords.
 
Not sharing the number used for two-step authentication with work colleagues.
 
Providing fake personal information on each email account, such as a mother's name.
 
Avoiding the installation of unknown repositories, programs, or scripts.
 
 ​
 That covers the safety aspect.
 ​
 To ensure reliability, I always keep an external HD on hand that I can quickly use for work in case anything goes wrong with my work PC.
 ​
 I'm considering what else I could do. I've heard that password management apps are very secure, and some even offer two-step authentication. Additionally, syncing a folder to Google Drive might be the best way to ensure uninterrupted access to important data, regardless of any issues. However, I'm unsure if encrypting the HD has any downsides, such as decreased read/write speed or the risk of data loss due to errors.
 ​
 Ideally, for a reliable and safe scenario, it would be convenient to have all data saved in the cloud without the associated risks.
 ​
 What are your thoughts?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So, I'm working on making an boot image file for a device that uses Linux as a base OS, not sure what base distro, but for the majority of its system graphic files, it uses .bmp.gz files. Now, I already have my boot image file itself (640x480 24-bit color-depth bitmap) that's 901 KB in size. The trouble is, when I download a boot image from a community site that serves themes and boot logos, the boot logos are like 21 KB in size (that inflate to 901 KB .BMPs), and the default boot logo is deflated to a scant 10 KB! And it, too, inflates to 901 KB. When I use gzip to compress my file, I use the -v9k flag and only manage 84.1%, resulting in a compressed filesize of 144 KB. Is there anything I can do to increase compression?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Greetings, penguins. Got a question. So recently I had dual-boot Kali with Windows. After some failed usage of Kali I found out in web that Kali is not the best for desktop (better use with live boot). Then I transferred to Arch Linux, again dual-boot with Windows. But Arch wasn't so user friendly as I've expected. Instead of working for myself I was working to fix Arch. Now I have only Windows, but I want to use Linux as well, again with dual-boot. :)
 The question is what Linux distro would you recommend for dual-boot? I want something to help me understand how Linux works ( not ones that are 99% like Windows and etc. ) and if possible suitable for gaming. Thank you in advance!! :) 
 P. S. 
 If you're wondering why in the world I still want to use Windows the answer is Lenovo Vantage. My laptop is Lenovo Legion 5 pro and that app helps me to configure everything on my laptop, especially GPU Mode (Hybrid mode, dGPU mode, etc. ).

 I wonder if anyone has some kind of workaround or will the solution be implemented in some future updates? I saw that there are a lot of HP people that can't use Linux because of this and I think that is a big miss for everyone.
 I am grateful for every answer!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[人工智能工件需要新的开源许可证

上世纪七八十年代，由于自由软件运动的兴起，从版权法中衍生出来了自由及开源软件许可证，护航了自由及开源软件的蓬勃发展。人工智能诞生于开源软件，像 TensorFlow、PyTorch 这样的人工智能程序在其开源许可下运行良好。但新的人工智能工件，如数据集、模型、权重等并不完全适用于传统的版权模式。就像对 GitHub Copilot 输出的代码建议的起诉案，相信对用于训练人工智能违例使用各种训练素材的起诉会越来越多。甚至，会有像专利巨魔一样的许可证巨魔出现。开源倡议（OSI）和许多开源和人工智能领导人正在努力将人工智能和开源许可证以对两者都有意义的方式结合起来。


消息来源：The Register



老王点评：人工智能崛起的太快，一年前还没什么人谈论人工智能，以至于很多事情都来不及做好准备。所以，现在需要一个像当年的自由软件宣言一样的提纲挈领的倡议出现，以及在这个基础上建立的不同的许可证，才能真正为人工智能的发展铺平道路。




安卓的紧急呼叫打爆英国 999 紧急电话

安卓 12 系统为紧急服务增加了一个简单的功能：只要连按五次电源键，你的手机就会为你拨打紧急服务。当手机放在你的口袋里，或者你有一个不正常的电源按钮时，这显然很容易意外地做到。英国警方称，“所有紧急服务机构目前都在经历创纪录的 999 电话量”。有趣的是，带有这个功能的安卓 12 是在一年半前推出的，但直到现在才逐步普及到足够多的设备上。从那时起，就有源源不断的帖子提醒人们注意这个问题。在补丁出来之前，谷歌目前的建议是关闭该功能。


消息来源：Ars Technica



老王点评：这又是一个产品经理想当然的功能。




新车质量因使用更多新技术而下降

据研究，在美国销售的新车的质量正在下降，因为越来越多地使用了新技术和某些零件的制造质量下降等因素使这些车型更有“问题”。报告说，在过去两年中，每 100 辆车的问题数（PP100）上升了 30。特斯拉的 PP100 质量评级，同比增加了 31，到 2023 年达到了 257。新车提供的电子触摸式设计的门把手也成为了一个问题，在 10 个问题最多的车型中，有 7 个是电池电动车。


消息来源：路透社



老王点评：电动车是有很多先进的地方，但是堆砌不成熟的新技术往往是造成崩溃的原因。这有点像一个刚刚学会使用新框架的开发者，喜欢利用各种新功能来开发软件，但是往往出现一些问题。]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[《线的文化史》，[英]蒂姆·英戈尔德著，张晓佳译，明室Lucida｜北京联合出版社，2023年5月出版，288页，62.00元

日本科幻小说家伴名练的短篇小说《平滑世界和它的敌人》（收于《平滑世界和它的敌人》，丁丁虫译，译林出版社，2022年）讲述了一个有趣的故事：作品设定人类开发出一种名为“乘觉”的第六感，可以自由穿梭于平行时空当中，这样一来世界就变得无比“平滑”——无论在何时何地遇到问题，人只要调动“乘觉”前往新的时空，问题便可迎刃而解。
然而就是这样一个“美丽新世界”，却依然有它的敌人。有人开发出一种可以屏蔽“乘觉”的药物，结果一场意外事故让一名制药厂员工不慎失去了“乘觉”，这名员工出于报复心理，试图向社会投放这种药物。故事接下来的走向乍看出人意料，却又在情理之中——当人的所有经验都可以自由索取、无限重来，“一生一次”的体验反而变得弥足珍贵、令人心仪。
从某种意义上，我们这个世界虽然还做不到“来去自由”，但它的确是在向“平滑化”迈进。今天的人们足不出户便能接收全球资讯，轻点鼠标即可与世界另一端的人“实时互联”，更不必说种种方兴未艾的“虚拟现实”（VR）和“增强现实”（AR）技术，其实就是在为人类提供自由穿梭于平行时空的可能。然而这种“平滑”也滋生了诸多问题，譬如它的脆弱性——我们几乎无法忍受自己或是他者“不在线”或是“掉线”；再如当现实世界被置换为“屏幕世界”，“避开现实而紧盯屏幕已经成为现状。屏幕训练我们去顺应和满足现状，而我们已经开始接受这种现状并取其精华、去其糟粕”（[荷兰]诺伦·格尔茨：《虚无主义》，张红军译，商务印书馆，123页）。
基于这样的前提，英国人类学家蒂姆·英戈尔德的这部《线的文化史》今天读来格外有趣。由人类的制线行为（line-making）入手，英戈尔德考察了“线”作为一种现象，在人类实践中的存在及其演变。在他看来，作为主体的“实线”曾经是人…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've been using Linux since 2017 as my main OS until my old laptop stopped working last year and I had to buy another one. My choice was the Galaxy Book S - but my nightmare started when I arrived home and tried to install Ubuntu on it. For some reason, the installer couldn't recognize any disk, and the same issue appeared over and over, no matter which distro I tried to use. 
 After some research I found out that this model does not use a regular SSD, but an eUFS instead (I've never heard about it before, apparently it is often used within smartphones). Since then, I'm stuck in Windows. Ubuntu sometimes recognizes it but it's never able to finish installation, the disk always disappears before it.
 Does anyone have any idea of how to solve it? I've been thinking in some way to install just a "windows-skeleton-alike" with no visual system, just code, and install a virtual machine with Ubuntu above it, but I'm not sure if this is even a possibility.
 I do not like using Windows at all, and I don't know what to do anymore. Unfortunately selling it and buying another is not an option at the moment.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[这篇初学者指南解释了在 Ubuntu、Linux Mint 和 Windows 中升级到最新 LibreOffice 所需的步骤。




LibreOffice 被全球数百万用户使用，是当今最流行的免费办公套件。它由电子表格程序 （Calc）、文档处理器（Writer）、演示文稿（Impress）、绘图（Draw）和数学模块组成，可帮助你完成大部分办公、商务、学术和日常工作。

由于与 DOCX、PPTX 和 XLSX 等专有文件格式兼容，LibreOffice 可以作为付费的微软 Office 套件的出色替代品。它是 Apache OpenOffice 生产力套件的一个分支，由数以千计的全球贡献者积极开发。



升级到最新的 LibreOffice

LibreOffice 改变了它的版本命名方式，不再采用"Fresh"和"Still"的概念。现在，LibreOffice 有一个社区版和一个推荐的企业版。这是因为许多企业使用带有最新功能的最新 LibreOffice 版本，这对开发工作造成了阻碍。因此，团队建议企业用户从 LibreOffice 官方合作伙伴那里获得付费支持，以获得长期支持。你可以在 此处 阅读博文。

以下是当前的版本：

最新的 LibreOffice 版本


当前的 LibreOffice 社区版本系列是 LibreOffice 7.4.x。

LibreOffice 稳定推荐的商业版本是 LibreOffice 7.3.x。


在 Ubuntu、Linux Mint 和其他基于 Ubuntu 的发行版中升级到最新的 LibreOffice

Ubuntu 22.04 LTS Jammy Jellyfish 具有 LibreOffice 7.3.x。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Over on the Software Freedom Conservancy blog, Policy Fellow and Hacker-in-Residence Bradley M. Kuhn analyzes the recent changes to Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) source availability in light of the GPL.  It contains some interesting information about two alleged GPL violations that came about because the company's business model is structured in a way that brings it too close to non-compliance with the license, he said:

Perhaps the biggest problem with a murky business model that skirts the line of GPL compliance is that violations can and do happen — since even a minor deviation from the business model clearly violates the GPL agreements. Pre-IBM Red Hat deserves a certain amount of credit, as SFC is aware of only two documented incidents of GPL violations that have occurred since 2006 regarding the RHEL business model. We've decided to share some general details of these violations for the purpose of explaining where this business model can so easily cross the line.

[...] In another violation incident, we learned that Red Hat, in a specific non-USA country, was requiring that any customer who lowered the number of RHEL machines under service contract with Red Hat sign an additional agreement. This additional agreement promised that the customer had deleted every copy of RHEL in their entire organization other than the copies of RHEL that were currently contracted for service with Red Hat. Again, this is a "further restriction". The GPL agreements give everyone the unfettered right to make and keep as many copies of the software as they like, and a distributor of GPL'd software may not require a user to attest that they've deleted these legitimate, licensed copies of third-party-licensed software under the GPL. SFC informed Red Hat's legal department of this violation, and we were assured that this additional agreement would no longer be presented to any Red Hat customers in the future.]]></summary>

But once you start installing other software, you run into problems which do not exist in X11: you can't watch hardware accelerated videos on Chromium and derived browsers (massive shoutout to firefox for being there), various GNOME extensions will freeze up the system (ex. Pixel saver), adwaita themes will mess up (light theme on one app, dark on another) to name a few.
 Wayland still have a long way to go , till then, X11 remains the only option if you don't want to walk on egg shells.

This code is part of the Linux INET6 implementation and is responsible for the IPv6 Address auto configuration (https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v6.2.11/source/net/ipv6/addrconf.c#L3).
 Overall, each IPv6 entity in the network needs a globally unique address for communicating outside of the local segment. In order to get such an address there are a few options: manual assignment of an address, DHCPv6 (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol version 6) and SLAAC (Stateless Address Autoconfiguration). When talking about stateless and stateful it means if there is a server/device that keep tracks of a state for each address assignment (https://www.networkac…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[《华尔街日报》6月23日消息，Facebook母公司Meta周四表示，在加拿大议会通过一项迫使互联网巨头向新闻出版商付费的法案后，将终止在加拿大的Facebook和Instagram上提供新闻。


加拿大参议院周四批准了《在线新闻法案》（Online News Act），预计不久将正式通过。Meta在声明中说：“今天，我们确认，在《在线新闻法》生效之前，加拿大所有用户将无法在Facebook和Instagram上获取新闻。”


报道指出，加拿大“在线新闻法案”要求脸书和谷歌等互联网巨头付费使用当地媒体的新闻内容，这意味着加拿大成为继澳大利亚后第二个立法要求互联网公司为使用当地媒体新闻内容付费的国家。澳大利亚于 2021 年通过“新闻媒体与数字平台强制议价法案”。


谷歌对此抗议称，加拿大法律比澳大利亚更加严格，希望加拿大修改立法。多家美国互联网公司也表态称，这些立法对他们的业务造成了影响。


加拿大内阁领导人特鲁多谴责称，Meta 和谷歌在反抗这个法案时，用了“霸凌的手段”。法案的主要起草人、加拿大文化遗产部长 Pablo Rodriguez 也在声明中强调，这是加拿大民众对抗科技巨头的第一步。

在 Linux 命令行中，如何 搜索文件？你可以使用 find 命令。这是标准答案，没有问题。

通常，你键入带有搜索参数的命令，按回车键，然后它会显示搜索结果。

你可以通过模糊搜索来提升终端中的文件搜索体验。

模糊搜索是一种近似搜索算法或技术。在这种搜索中，通过名称搜索指定位置的文件，并实时显示结果给用户。

模糊搜索在网络搜索引擎中很受欢迎，用户开始输入术语后，它会开始显示与该术语相关的结果。

在本文中，我将讨论两个命令行工具，它们可以让你在 Linux 中执行模糊搜索：


fzf：模糊查找工具

fzy：模糊选择工具


fzf：Linux 中的模糊查找工具

fzf 是一款可用于 Linux 的模糊搜索工具，你可以通过它进行交互式文件搜索。

在 Ubuntu 中安装 fzf，打开终端并运行以下命令：

sudo apt install fzf


虽然 fzf 本身可以正常工作，但最好与其他工具配合使用，以充分发挥其功能。

使用 fzf

打开终端并运行：

fzf


这将打开一个 fzf 提示符，在当前工作目录中搜索文件。



为 fzf 应用边框

你可以使用 --border 选项为 fzf 应用边框，有多种边框可用，如 rounded（圆角）、sharp（尖角）等。

fzf --border=rounded




应用背景和前景颜色

使用颜色属性，你可以为 fzf 设置 ANSI 颜色，可以作为背景、前景或两者都设置。



fzf --color="bg:black,fg:yellow"


你可以串联这些选项，使 fzf 在视觉上更加美观。

现在，让我展示一些 fz…]]></summary>

They allow to make charts quickly. 
But you lose flexibility: you're limited by the options they offer.
I just created a gallery with hundreds of graphs made with d3.js and React. 
- Examples are split by graph types
- They all come with explanation and code sandboxes
- Gradual complexity to ease the learning curve
It took me ages to create this project! Feedback welcome!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[AlmaLinux 确认受到 RHEL 源代码发布变化影响

针对 昨天 红帽发布的改变 RHEL 源代码发布方式的公告，AlmaLinux 发布声明称，这将限制他们 1:1 复制 RHEL 构建的能力。因为 CentOS Stream 虽然是 RHEL 的上游，但并不总是包括 RHEL 软件包中的所有补丁和更新。想要做到完全复制，需要有 RHEL 构建版本时的源代码。而要获得该源代码，AlmaLinux 称，“不幸的是，按照我们今天的理解，红帽公司的用户界面协议表明，重新发布通过客户门户获得的资源将违反这些协议。”在短期内，他们将专注于通过跟踪 CentOS Stream 的变化和 Oracle Linux 等来为 AlmaLinux 提供安全更新。但从长远来看，他们将与其他 RHEL 下游产品和合作伙伴合作，寻找一条合适的发展道路。


消息来源：AlmaLinux



老王点评：对于这件事红帽背后的动机我们就不妄自揣测了，毕竟红帽和 AlmaLinux 曾经“建立了令人难以置信的工作关系”。但事实就是，社区构建的 AlmaLinux 想要跟上 RHEL 的构建会越来越麻烦和越来越慢。所以，你怎么看呢？




哈佛给计算机学生们配备了一位聊天机器人老师

哈佛大学将为今年秋季的计算机科学导论 CS50 课程的学生配置一位聊天机器人老师。这个聊天机器人将不使用 ChatGPT 或 GitHub Copilot，因为它们“太有帮助了”。相反，哈佛大学已经开发了自己的大型语言模型 “CS50 机器人”，它将 “具有类似的精神”，但将专注于 “引导学生找到答案，而不是将答案交给他们”。


消息来源：PCMag



老王点评：我认为哈佛大学走在了正确的道路，拥抱 AI，而不是让 AI 替代人类，让 AI 帮助学习，而不是让学生抄袭 AI 的作业。




E3 或许再也不会举办

之前，我们 报道 过，今年的 E3 2023 已经取消，这本应是 2019 年后的第一次 E3 线下盛会。现在，E3 已经取消了 2024 年和 2025 年在洛杉矶的活动。这表明有些事情阻碍了 E3 的回归，或者其组织者正在考虑将其迁出洛杉矶。

老王点评：一场大流行，改变了很多。很多事情再也回不到过去了。]]></summary>

 I have a microcontroller board on which I am opening up an MMS port. I set the board on a static IP (this is required) and I am trying to see what data I am getting on the IEDExplorer tool which works on MMS protocol.
 Now, if the system that runs the IEDExplorer tool is on a static IP of the same range (10.3.11.x) then it works, but if the system is on a dynamic IP of the range 172.x.x.x, I can ping the board but I don't see any data on the tool.
 The application that I am using is correct because it has been previously on a different Linux image and a different processor. 
 The only thing that I am suspecting is that something might be wrong with the Linux image I have built using yocto and if something can be changed about it. 
 Feel free to ask more details and I would be really glad if you can help me out as I don't see any solution at all. (Firewall is allowing all the traffic and there is no proxy)
 ​
 Thanks.

尽管我们可以将德国思想家布鲁门贝格（Hans Blumenberg，1920-1996）的学术研究视为现代欧陆哲学隐喻复兴运动的重要组成，但他的思想风格既无法完全归入胡塞尔的现象学传统，也不属于重返修辞的后哲学论说。有趣的是，倘若我们试着列一份康德之后以独特生活方式著称的思想家名单，布鲁门贝格一定位列其中。与大多数犹太裔学者一样，布鲁门贝格在二战结束后返回校园，最初在汉堡大学师从胡塞尔的助手兰德格里伯（Ludwig Landgrebe，1902-1991）学习哲学、日耳曼学和古典语文学，后跟随他转入基尔大学，并在那里获得博士学位。1947年起，布鲁门贝格辗转汉堡大学、吉森大学、波鸿鲁尔大学和明斯特大学任教，直到1985年在明斯特退休。不接受采访，不参与学术和公共活动，退休后的布鲁门贝格以哲学隐士的姿态隐居于僻静之处。这不禁让人想起康德《纯粹理性批判》的题词：“关于自己，我们宁可沉默。”（De nobis ipsis silemus. 伽达默尔也曾将这句话写在自传扉页上）

1980年，布鲁门贝格获得弗洛伊德奖时发表演说。

归隐的生活状态和晦涩的写作风格削弱了布鲁门贝格的学术知名度，但也让一部分人相当着迷，小说家西碧拉·莱维查洛夫（Sibylle Lewitscharoff）便是其中之一。布鲁门贝格深爱与狮子有关的隐喻，他在《不在场的狮子：书斋里的圣哲罗姆》（Das Abwesende am Löwen: Hieronymus im Gehäus mit Sanduhr；收录于其身后整理出版的《狮子》一书）中讨论了一头试图攻击圣哲罗姆的狮子被圣人的雄辩和哲思驯服，从此庇护其左右的故事。莱维查洛夫由此得到灵感，创作了小说《布鲁门贝格》。在小说中，狮子在某天晚上悄然出…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[到目前为止，我们已经讲解了包括 变量、可变性、常量、数据类型、函数、if-else 语句 和 循环 在内的一些关于 Rust 编程的基础知识。

在 Rust 基础系列的最后一章里，让我们现在用 Rust 编写一个程序，使用这些主题，以便更好地理解它们在现实世界中的用途。让我们来编写一个相对简单的程序，用来从水果市场订购水果。

我们程序的基本结构

来让我们首先向用户问好，并告诉他们如何与程序交互。

fn main() {
    println!("欢迎来到水果市场！");
    println!("请选择要购买的水果。\n");

    println!("\n可以购买的水果：苹果、香蕉、橘子、芒果、葡萄");
    println!("购买完成后，请输入“quit”或“q”。\n");
}


获取用户输入

上面的代码非常简单。目前，你不知道接下来该做什么，因为你不知道用户接下来想做什么。

所以让我们添加一些代码，接受用户输入并将其存储在某个地方以便稍后解析，然后根据用户输入采取适当的操作。

use std::io;

fn main() {
    println!("欢迎来到水果市场！");
    println!("请选择要购买的水果。\n");

    println!("\n可以购买的水果：苹果、香蕉、橘子、芒果、葡萄");
    println!("购买完成后，请输入“quit”或“q”。\n");

    // 获取用户输入
    let mut user_input = String::new();
    io::stdin()
        .read_line(&mut user_input)
        .expect("无法读取用户输入。");
}

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[美国联邦贸易委员会(FTC)将于周四在联邦法庭上提出初步禁令，以暂时阻止微软690亿美元（备注：当前约4954.2亿元人民币）收购动视暴雪(Activision Blizzard)。他们认为在政府作出裁决之前应该先停止交易。


微软曾表示，“临时阻止”可能会破坏这笔交易，但法院通常不会考虑这种现实后果。如果法院暂停这笔交易，微软和动视暴雪就得将其原定于7月18日终止的协议延后。


在旧金山一家联邦法官预定为期五天的听证会上，反垄断执法机构将辩称，它需要让微软公司和动视暴雪公司在联邦法院就合并案作出裁决之前暂缓该交易，因为该机构的内部法院尚未就该交易是否损害了游戏行业的竞争状况作出裁决。


FTC担心，如果没有联邦法院采取行动，两家公司的合并“可能会改变动视暴雪的运营和商业计划”，并且可能导致微软获取敏感的企业信息。


据悉，FTC内部的行政听证会定于8月2日开始，而解决美国FTC的诉讼是微软和动视暴雪在全球范围内争取完成这笔交易的关键反垄断战之一。


FTC认为，这笔交易将是微软有史以来最大的一笔交易，也是游戏业务史上最大的一笔交易。它将使微软拥有“削弱或降低动视暴雪内容的能力和动机”，从而实质性地减少竞争。


此外，FTC曾在12月份要求其内部行政法庭阻止这笔交易，并表示该合并将使微软的Xbox游戏机独占动视暴雪游戏，而任天堂和索尼会被排除在外。


微软曾表示，这笔交易将有利于游戏玩家和游戏公司双方的利益，并已向FTC提出签署具有法律约束力的同意书，承诺在未来十年内向包括索尼在内的竞争对手提供“使命召唤”游戏。


听证会将于6月22日开始，持续到6月29日。微软首席执行官萨蒂亚・纳德拉(Satya Nadella)和动视暴雪首席执行官鲍比・科迪克(Bobby Kotick)等高管都将作为证人出庭作证。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So I've had a Lenovo Yoga 2 pro (2013) that I've had Ubuntu and mint on previously installed. It came with windows 8, but it has issues related to windows 10 so I tried Linux. Both mint and Ubuntu worked initially for awhile, but eventually both hit a point where the track pad stops responding until I do a full reinstall. I also noticed that the fans seemed to run higher more often than windows. I'm curious if another distro would fix these problems or if it just isn't going to work. 
 I'd use it mainly for hobby programming/browsing, and to learning Linux more. If it's futile also looking for laptop suggestions for replacements in the future.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Openbox 是一款适用于 Linux 的轻量级、可配置的窗口堆叠式管理器。它支持许多标准，适用于任何桌面环境。

可能让你惊讶的是，LXDE 和 LXQT 桌面环境都是基于 Openbox 构建的。你甚至可以用它替换桌面环境的窗口管理器。

当然，你几乎可以在任何 Linux 发行版上安装 Openbox。不过，配置它需要时间和精力。

一个更简单的方法是使用提供 Openbox 变种的发行版。在本文中，我列出了一些能够让你轻松体验 Openbox 的发行版。

注意： 列表按字母顺序排列，不代表排名。

1、Archcraft



如果你想体验 Openbox 窗口管理器，Archcraft 是一个不错的选择。不像其他发行版，Openbox 是这个发行版的默认桌面环境，所以你可以期待它的表现优秀。

它提供了一个精简且轻量的环境，只需不到 500MB 的内存即可运行，而且外观上也没有降级。其界面元素风格统一。

你可以通过简单点击来切换主题，如果你喜欢，它还提供了类似 Windows 的用户界面。

对于资深用户来说，它内置了对 AUR 和 Chaotic-AUR 的支持。与其他发行版不同的是，它提供了最佳的开箱即用体验。


Archcraft


2、ArcolinuxB Openbox



如果你想学习 Arch（Arcolinux 项目的主要目标），ArcolinuxB Openbox 是一个非常优秀的 Linux 桌面发行版。

它是 ArcolinuxB 项目的众多变种之一。你可能会遇到一些学习曲线和不完善的地方。

与 Archcraft 不同，你在这里不会看到完全统一的界面元素，可能需要进行一些调整来获得良好的体验。


ArcolinuxB


3、AV Linux MX Edition

I found a way to disable the title bar on windows using the win32 api and it works perfectly. I’m now trying to do the same thing on linux while still been able to resize the window and rounded corners.
 I can already get the window and the display with 
 Display* display = glfwGetX11Display(); Window x11Window = glfwGetX11Window(window);
 Any help would be appreciated :)

 Alternative but more accurate title. Hackers installed software and did bad stuff on already compromised systems running a shitty and obscure Linux derivative used for crypto bro mining. It is unclear how they even got access.
 In other news, Microsoft Azure, outlook 365, and Azure SQL server have all been hacked and lost customer data in the past year.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I recently had a more junior coworker take an AWS Solutions Architect course, and I realized I am missing out on my company's personal development resources, but I am not all that interested in an AWS Solutions Architecture course, in part because a) I don't want to, and b) I know a bunch of AWS stuff by now anyway
So I am curious what are some interesting educational resources for people in more advanced engineering roles? Courses or resources that might help one move to an Architect or Principal/Staff role?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The AlmaLinux organization has posted a message
describing the impact of Red Hat's decision to stop releasing the source to
the RHEL distribution and how AlmaLinux will respond.


	In the immediate term, our plan is to pull from CentOS Stream
	updates and Oracle Linux updates to ensure security patches
	continue to be released. These updates will be carefully curated to
	ensure they are 1:1 compatible with RHEL, while not violating Red
	Hat’s licensing, and will be vetted and tested just like all of our
	other releases.


Update: Rocky Linux has also sent out a
release on the subject.  "There will be no disruption or change for
any Rocky Linux users, collaborators, or partners".]]></summary>

I installed Ubuntu, Fedora, Linux Mint, Pop!_OS, Manajro, Arch Linux, Debian, Vanilla OS, etc. In all of them I had problems with overheating, no iGPU usage resulting in Twitch dropping frames like crazy and other problems. I will be switching to a PC soon and I wanted to clean the iMac, change the hard drive, reapply thermal paste and install Linux but this problems always persists. Any idea?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[RHEL 源代码将只放在 CentOS Stream 上

在没有宣布废弃 CentOS 之前，RHEL 的源代码会发布在 git.centos.org 上，那时候 CentOS 还是 RHEL 的下游。之后，在 CentOS Stream 成为 RHEL 的上游后，该仓库得以保留。红帽宣布，“CentOS Stream 将成为公开发布 RHEL 相关源代码的唯一仓库。对于红帽的客户和合作伙伴，源代码将继续通过红帽客户门户网站提供。”并进一步澄清，“这一变化并不意味着CentOS 项目、CentOS Stream 或 CentOS SIG 的源代码可用性有任何变化。”但这一举动引来了社区的一些人的担心，“Alma Linux，Rocky Linux，Oracle Linux 等将更难提供与 RHEL 版本 1:1 的二进制兼容的构建。”


消息来源：Phoronix



老王点评：我认为，从目前的声明上看，这种担心或许是多余的，我们只需要观察之后的 RHEL 和 CentOS Stream 之间差异有多大就好了。但从对这个事情的反应可以看出，社区对红帽的信任在降低。




Reddit 用户涌入 Lemmy

类似马斯克收购 Twitter 后 Twitter 难民涌入 Mastodon，大量 Reddit 难民涌入了 Lemmy 实例。其中，lemmy.world 实例的总用户数达到了 3.8 万。突然间，Lemmy 已经成为最大的联邦宇宙项目之一。在 Reddit 社区重新开放之后，部分用户可能会离开，但也许有更多用户会留下。


消息来源：Lemmy



老王点评：这些联邦宇宙社区会得到更多用户，但 Twitter、Reddit 失血更多。




C++ 26 标准正在制定中

C++ 版本以其发布的年份命名，并遵循三年的周期。国际标准化组织 C++ 标准委员会发布了 C++ 26 的进展情况。根据其时间表，新语言功能的截止日期是 2024 年第三季度，功能冻结将在 2025 年第一季度。委员会已经通过了 40 份 “修改文件”，增加了 _ 字符通配符，基本字符集添加了 @、$ 和 `。此外，在 C++ 26 中还支持了危险指针。危险指针是指 “只有其所有者可以设置其值，而任何数量的线程都可以读取其值” 的指针，它很难导致非常常见的内存安全问题。


消息来源：Dev Class



老王点评：在我看来，C++ 标准的演进有一定的意义，但是这并不能阻止其传统的领域被 Rust、Carbon 等新底层语言的侵蚀。]]></summary>

 I have T440p laptop on which i installed OpenSuse TW. I can only use it with external monitor because the built in screen wont turn on. I tried installing Nvidia drivers with Yast - and i did it - nothing special.
 But laptop is always using the iGPU (which i read online is the cause of the problem). Also using YAST i installed bbswitch and bumblebee, nvidia and suse prime and what not - but nothing is helping. I would like to be able to use the laptop on the go and without the external monitor. 
 Does anyone know how to fix this, because i really want to learn Linux and use it for school and am also switching from windows - but i spen almost two months trying to solve the problem without success. Thank you for your help in advance and see you

An old laptop, and i wanted to make it alive again, I found out that the battery is dead, and im not planning to replace it. Replaced the hard thermal paste on both gpu and cpus, then i tried running it with only the charger. I remember upgrading it from windows 7 to windows 10. It booted up successfully. After using it for some minutes, It just powers off. I have an inference that it is caused by the temperature, i tried turning on power saver and did almost everything to minimize the temperature in use. Then i decided to swtich the operating system to linux, xubuntu. Downloaded the media files, making a bootable drive to install, and then its now successfully installed with no interruptions. I ran the laptop on its coolest before I installed xubuntu. After the installation, the laptop is cooking, same temp before when trying windows 10. I tried to update and upgrade packages, after waiting for some time (it was like 33% don) the laptop just powered off. Same issue before, its got the cooking temp, still dont know the numbers, but it is really hot. I decided to install lm sensors after i booted up the system, lowered the brightness. I dont see any power consumption related settings other than sleep mode, display power management etc. Its currently idle for about half an hour, 51.0°c, 53.0°c (core 1 and 2). I will wait for it to measure if it can stay longer when idle. Ill test later when in-use.
 I wanted to know if there are any methods that can help reduce the temperature of my laptop using the os or fiddling with the computer's configuration.
 Thank you!

美国学者莎拉·罗伯茨（Sarah T. Roberts）被誉为“数字时代的先锋研究者”，她在2010-2018年长达八年的时间里持续展开了对互联网公司中的商业性内容审核员群体的工作状况及生存环境的访谈调查与实例研究，《幕后之人：社交媒体时代的内容审核》（原书名Behind the Screen:Content Moderation in the Shadows of Social Media，2019）是一部具有开创性的互联网田野调查与社会学研究的专著。作者的调查对象与研究主题指向全球性的商业化社交媒体的内容审核运作：针对互联网上日益巨量而良莠混杂的内容，商业性内容审核是必要的工作，因此互联网公司要雇用数以百万计的内容审核员评估社交平台用户上传的信息，筛选和删除色情、暴力、仇恨言论等不良内容。但是由于各种原因，这个工作群体一直隐身于幕后，其游离于社会、薪资低微、劳累过度、精神创伤等生存状况亦一直未能引起社会关注与疗救。莎拉·罗伯茨克服了互联网公司保密协议、地域限制等重重困难，对从硅谷到菲律宾、从专业审核公司到主要社交媒体的一线员工进行了深度采访，全面考察、分析了互联网商业性内容审核工作的不同类型（短期合同工、专业公司、外包、零工）及作为“幕后之人”的审核员群体的工作与生存状况，同时也对内容审核与相关政策争议、对现实影响的关系进行了分析和阐述。“打开了一扇了解内容审核这一晦暗不明世界的窗口。……是数字经济这一关键领域的权威著作，必将影响未来几年的政策和研究。”联合国特别报告员大卫·凯依（David Kaye）对该书的这一评语是客观、中肯的。

黄宾虹曾跋：“巨然墨法自米氏父子、高房山、吴仲圭一脉相承，学者宗之，及董玄宰用兼皴带染法，娄东、虞山日益凌替，至道咸为之中兴。”（图一）黄宾虹从道光、咸丰年间金石碑学之昌盛中寻到了中国画变革的动力，以“道咸画学中兴说”批判自宋以降落向窠臼的传统艺术，在二十世纪上半叶掀起了一场以北宋为宗的中国画“文艺复兴”。在深空探测和AI技术获得突破性发展的二十一世纪二十年代，再次回溯百余年前中国画坛的风云变幻，我们有理由以更广阔的眼光观想一张与十九至二十世纪之际世界艺术之现代主义运动同构的中国画史图景。我们业已建立寻常的画史共识：清末绘画流于程式，日渐凌替，以黄宾虹、齐白石为代表的一批先锋者将中国画从陈陈相因的泥淖中解放出来，就此开创了二十世纪中国画的现代主义。

图一 黄宾虹《拟巨然墨法》，1952年，浙江省博物馆藏

倘若我们将这一阶段视为中国画之现代性的起点，那么在百余年之后，我们是否能够，哪怕是在极为宽泛的层面上界说出中国画的后现代主义、解构主义？后现代在西方的生发有其具体的语境，将其去语境地附会在中国显然不是科学的思量，但唯独不可否认的是，这些“先锋的时髦语汇”被利用在当代中国极其繁荣的艺术活动中，可每每回归到作品——画面内部，我们的内心是否会不可避免地引发一丝对作者所宣称的思想的忧疑。形式与内容的不自洽使得我们在总体上很难坚定地否认，当代的中国画并没有完全摆脱、超越由现代主义者——黄宾虹、潘天寿诸家代表的世代所开创的“纪元”，即便我们已经走过了西方艺术史断代的现代主义时期。中国画的题材、创作手段、艺术形式较百余年前早已大相径庭，可为什么还要做出如此扫兴的论断？重大问题的症结首先并不出在方法、技术、媒材甚至概念上，而是归咎于深刻的意识层面，至少，中国画面对自…]]></summary>

当你习惯于一个操作系统时，很容易将其他操作系统看作是“应用程序”。如果你在桌面上使用一种操作系统，你可能会认为另一种操作系统是人们用来运行服务器的应用程序，而又一种操作系统是用来玩游戏的应用程序，依此类推。有时我们会忘记操作系统是计算机管理无数任务的部分（从技术上讲，每秒数百万个任务），它们通常设计成能够执行各种任务。当有人问我 Linux 能做什么 时，我通常会问他们想让它做什么。这没有一个单一的答案，所以这里有五个让我惊讶的 Linux 用途。

1、用 Linux 进行激光切割



在离我最近的创客空间里，有一台巨大的工业机器，大约和一张沙发一样大小，可以根据一个简单的线条图设计文件来切割各种材料。这是一台强大的激光切割机，令我惊讶的是，我第一次使用它时发现它只需要通过 USB 线连接到我的 Linux 笔记本电脑上。事实上，在许多方面，与许多台式打印机相比，连接这台激光切割机更容易，因为许多台式打印机需要过于复杂和臃肿的驱动程序。

使用 Inkscape 和 一个简单的插件，你可以为这台工业激光切割机设计切割线条。你可以为你的树莓派笔记本设计一个外壳，使用这些知识共享的设计方案来建造 一个密码锁盒、切割一个店面标牌，或者你心目中的其他任何想法。而且，你可以完全使用开源软件来完成这些操作。

2、在 Linux 上进行游戏



开源游戏一直都有，最近一段时间也有一些备受瞩目的 Linux 游戏。我建造的第一台游戏电脑就是一台 Linux 电脑，我觉得我邀请过来一起玩沙发合作游戏的人们都没有意识到他们是在 Linux 上进行游戏。这是一种流畅顺滑的体验，而且取决于你愿意在硬件上花费多少，可能上无止境吧。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[6月21日消息，亿欧网创始人黄渊普发布一封举报信，实名举报全国政协委员、知乎创始人兼CEO周源恶意挑拨员工群体与企业主群体对立、严重破坏国内营商环境。黄渊普表示，恳请有关部门介入，调查我所说的情况；我愿意协助调查和调研，为有关部门提供必要的材料和证据。


以下为公开信全文：



黄渊普：实名举报全国政协委员、知乎创始人兼CEO周源恶意挑拨员工群体与企业主群体对立、严重破坏国内营商环境


尊敬的相关部门领导，我叫黄渊普，作为主要创始人做了一家叫“亿欧”《北京亿欧网盟科技有限公司》的小公司，籍贯为湖南邵阳，户籍所在地在上海市长宁区，身份证号43052719xx10xx42xx，联系方式为：15810157304。我今天实名举报全国政协委员、知乎〔北京智者天下科技有限公司，简称“知乎”）创始人兼CEO周源通过其创立的知乎平台、设置不合理的机制恶意挑拨了员工群体与企业主群体对立、严重破坏了国内营商环境。


以下为我的陈述，我对我所说的话负责；


2023年6月20日上午，在听到一位创业者朋友抱怨自己在知乎平台上被人匿名诽谤的事情后，我也在知乎上搜索了一下自己的名字“黄渊普”。发现一个“提问”（目前知乎上已经被删）∶亿欧黄渊普会卷钱跑路吗？


这个提问由知乎的匿名用户以匿名的方式提出。但其实，亿欧是科创产业智库，商业模式主要是给科技企业提供研究、咨询、品牌等服务，主营业务应收账款较大，只有占营收非常小的会员和VIP服务采取先付款后提供服务的方式。


这个提问和描述十分恶意，把我本人与某不同行业领域的企业负责人做恶意对比。这个提问，在我发现它之前，它应该已经存在一段时间（知乎的“提问”不对外显示提问时间）。在我发现这个提问之前，它对我个人名誉已经造成了损害，对公司品牌和人才招聘也有不利影响。


这不是我第一次在知乎上遭遇这类匿名提问和匿…]]></summary>

 If we look at professional use and sum up the % of the platforms, it doesn't add up to 100%.
 Wouldn't WSL under Windows be considered Windows?
 If we add all the Linux distros together then the % is the highest?
 If we add up the responses of Linux distros, it's ~47.5k which is higher than the responses for Windows - why did they list Windows as the most used platform?
 Why didn't they group Linux under a single category?
 Not sure how to interpret the results here, any ideas?

 I've tried copying several ways:
  
cp

 tar cf - [source] | (cd [destination]; tar xfp -)
 Nemo gui file transfer
  
Each time I get the same result, the first file transfers quickly at ~200 MB/s, and then slows to ~15 MB/s for subsequent files. Except nemo which is just terribly slow from the beginning. I don't know how to troubleshoot the cause of the slowdown any further and would appreciate any suggestions you might have. thanks!

I have googled everywhere about this and can't find anything. I should also mention that I had it working perfectly fine before it had no issue downloading, but then I wanted to move the folder and it is just not accepting it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello Hacker News community,
Wanted to share a project I started working on during my spare time and was then discovered by many in the open source community last week.
GPT Engineer’s mission:
Be the open platform for devs to tinker with and build their personal code-generation toolbox.
I believe it's key for us devs to engage in how building software can and will change.
You can find more info about the flexible technical "philosophy" to make it work well, and the community we want it to become on github:
https://github.com/AntonOsika/gpt-engineer
The project is still in early stages. It's clear that there is a lot of room for improvement as the space to combine tricks that guide LLM's is large.
Appreciate any suggestions, experiences, or ideas on the project from you all!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Kernel support for copy offload is a feature that has been floating around
in limbo for a decade or more at this point; it has been implemented along 
the way, but never merged.  The idea is that the host
system can simply ask a block storage device to copy some data within the device
and it 
will do so without further involving the host; instead of reading data into
the host so that it can be written back out again, the device circumvents
that process.  At the
2023 Linux Storage, Filesystem,
Memory-Management and BPF Summit, Nitesh Shetty led a storage and
filesystem session to discuss the current status of a patch set that he and
others have been working on, with an
eye toward getting something merged fairly soon.]]></summary>

 I have several nvme devices in my Ubuntu 22.04.02 machine and I'd like to manually calculate the write amplification of each device by dividing nand_bytes_written / host_bytes_written.
 I believe host_bytes_written can be calculated in the following manner:

 The above can be proven by using dd:
 $ nvme smart-log /dev/nvme0n1 |grep -e data_units_written data_units_written : 32,800,047 $ dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/nvme0n1 bs=512000 count=1000 oflag=direct 1000+0 records in 1000+0 records out 512000000 bytes (512 MB, 488 MiB) copied, 0.967242 s, 529 MB/s $ nvme smart-log /dev/nvme0n1 |grep -e data_units_written data_units_written : 32,801,047 <--…]]></summary>

 By limiting the RHEL public sources to CentOS Stream, it will now be more difficult for community/off-shoot enterprise Linux distributions like Alma Linux, Rocky Linux, Oracle Linux, etc, to provide 1:1 binary compatible builds against given RHEL releases.
 Seems like another move to kill off Alma or Rocky

is still not as easy as on x86 systems because many Arm devices require a

components. One distribution that addresses this problem is Armbian, which offers Debian- and
Ubuntu-based distributions for
many devices. The headline feature in the recent release, Armbian

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've been contemplating a switch from ArchLinux to Ubuntu and had a couple of concerns regarding Snap apps and package installation. I've heard mixed opinions about the startup speed of Snap apps in Ubuntu and wanted to know if it's a common issue or something that can be optimized. Additionally, I've come across comments stating that Ubuntu pushes users to install software exclusively through snaps, rather than using traditional deb packages. Is this true, and are there any limitations or drawbacks to this approach?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[据美联社报道，Twitter（推特）员工昨日向旧金山联邦法院提起诉讼，要求该公司兑现有关奖金的承诺。


员工们表示，在马斯克收购该公司之前的一个月里，包括前首席财务官内德・西格尔（Ned Segal）在内的高管“一再”向员工承诺，将支付他们 2022 年奖金的 50%。但随着马斯克的到来，这些关于奖金的承诺至今没有落地。


此次诉讼案件的首席原告马克・肖宾格（Mark Schobinger）是上月刚从 Twitter 离职的前薪酬高级总监，他的律师正代表 Twitter 现员工和前员工寻求集体诉讼。原告律师香农・利斯・赖尔丹（Shannon Liss-Riordan）表示，Twitter 所欠奖金达到“数千万美元”。


已经被马斯克解散媒体关系团队的 Twitter 除了自动回复外，没有就此给出其他回复评论。


此前报道，马斯克收购 Twitter 后一直在进行包括大幅裁员在内的各种成本压缩政策，这也导致该公司正面临来自前雇员的多起诉讼，以及众多尚未支付的账单。此前 Twitter 被曝出拒绝支付即将到期的谷歌云账单，并因拖欠房租被驱逐出位于美国科罗拉多州博尔德市的办公室。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[DeepMind 联合创始人提出新图灵测试

阿兰·图灵在 1950 年代提出了最早的对 AI 的测试，人类评估者判断他们是在和人类还是与 AI 说话。如果 AI 能冒充人类，那么它就通过了图灵测试。DeepMind 联合创始人 Mustafa Suleyman 在其新书中否定了传统的图灵测试，因为“它没有告诉我们系统能做什么或理解什么，是否建立了复杂的内心独白，或能在抽象的时间范围内进行规划”。他提出了新的图灵测试，“让 AI 将 10 万美元的种子基金变成 100 万美元，以此衡量 AI 是否具有类人的智能”。AI 需要研究一个电商方案，制定产品计划，找到制造商和销售商品。他预测 AI 将在两年内实现这一目标：“我们不只关心机器能说什么，我们还关心它能做什么。”


消息来源：Business Insider



老王点评：之前我们在 #1036 报道过，AI 撰写的商业计划书获得了更多投资人的青睐，我就谈到或许以后可以直接投资 AI 管理运营的企业。现在看起来，这个日子不会太远。不过，要是 AI 都会自己赚钱了，可以自己养自己了，还要人类干啥？




OpenAI 准备建立 AI 应用商店

据透露，OpenAI 正在考虑推出一个应用市场，客户可以将他们根据自己的需要定制的人工智能模型出售给其他企业。例如，可以发现在线零售交易中的金融欺诈，或回答有关特定市场的最新信息的模型。目前还不清楚 OpenAI 是否会对这些销售收取佣金，或者以其他方式从市场上获得收入。


消息来源：The Information



老王点评：有苹果应用商店的成功在前，这真是一个聪明的主意。不过我更倾向于将来会有 AI 自己使用的一种交易机制，AI 们可以在其中交易训练数据、模型权重和特定的模型等，并通过买来或学到的“技能”换取更多的交易机会。




微软计划淘汰原生的邮件和日历应用引来批评

微软打算关闭其时常被人诟病的邮件和日历应用程序，将其功能放到新的 Windows 版 Outlook 中。然而，尽管多年来用户对这些应用程序提出了一些批评，但对上述决定有一些强烈的负面反应。有用户评论，“看到微软为 Windows 开发网络应用，却为安卓、iOS 和 MacOS 打造高质量的原生应用，这有点搞笑，但也很悲哀。”用户认为淘汰邮件和日历的决定是对 WinUI 原生工具包的信心丧失，“如果你不能将 UWP 应用程序移植到本地工具包，这基本上就是承认没有人应该建立原生 Windows 应用程序。甚至微软也不使用他们自己的工具包。”


消息来源：The Register



老王点评：虽然邮件和日历应用有点鸡肋，但是连微软都不在自己的 Windows 上开发原生的应用，而用网络应用敷衍——这恐怕不完全是因为网络应用更流行，也是原生应用走衰的趋势吧。]]></summary>

Open For All，LLUG 经验与你共享

LLUG 举办的初衷是希望让大家可以从线上重归线下，与更多的人可以当面交流，迸发出灵感和创新的火花。而我们自己的力量是薄弱的，不足以支撑足够高频和多次的线下活动，我们希望有更多的人可以参与到线下活动的组织过程中。

所以，我们将我们的活动举办经验开放出来，方便有志于组织线下活动的同好们，可以和我们一起组织线下活动，促进更多的线下交流和沟通。

你可以在 https://github.com/Linux-CN/LLUG-Guides/tree/main 找到我们开放出来的 LLUG 活动组织手册，并参考手册，组织你自己的线下活动。

当然，在组织线下活动过程中，如果你认为手册有值得优化的点，也期待你能参与到项目的贡献当中，我们一起共建一个更好的活动组织手册。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[使用 Bash 中的 for 循环，为网页创建一个方便的调色板。


当计算机显示器的调色板有限时，网页设计师通常使用一组 Web 安全颜色 来创建网站。虽然在较新设备上显示的现代网站可以显示比最初的 Web 安全调色板更多的颜色，但我有时喜欢在创建网页时参考 Web 安全颜色。这样我就知道我的网页在任何地方都看起来不错。

你可以在网上找到 Web 安全调色板，但我想拥有自己的副本以方便参考。你也可以使用 Bash 中的 for 循环创建一个。

Bash for 循环

Bash 中的 for 循环 的语法如下所示：

for 变量 in 集合 ; do 语句 ; done


例如，假设你想打印从 1 到 3 的所有数字。你可以快速在 Bash 命令行上编写一个 for 循环来为你完成这项工作：

$ for n in 1 2 3 ; do echo $n ; done
1
2
3


分号是标准的 Bash 语句分隔符。它们允许你在一行中编写多个命令。如果你要在 Bash 脚本文件中包含这个 for 循环，你可以用换行符替换分号并像这样写出 for 循环：

for n in 1 2 3
  do
    echo $n
  done


我喜欢将 do 和 for 放在同一行，这样我更容易阅读：

for n in 1 2 3 ; do
  echo $n
done


一次多个 for 循环

你可以将一个循环放在另一个循环中。这可以帮助你迭代多个变量，一次做不止一件事。假设你想打印出字母 A、B 和 C 与数字 1、2 和 3 的所有组合。你可以在 Bash 中使用两个 for 循环来实现，如下所示：

#!/bin/bash
for number in 1 2 3 ; do
  for letter …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[《清代武科考试研究》，李林著，中华书局2022年12月出版，548页，168.00元

李林先生所著《清代武科考试研究》（以下简称“李著”）终于在2022年底出版了。该书一经面世，即在科举学界赢得一片赞誉。几个月来，我认真拜读了“李著”，深感这是一部超越以往研究清代武举制度的上乘之作，可谓是后来居上。
一
“李著”是在其博士论文基础上修改完成的。2014年，我曾赴香港中文大学参加李林的博士论文答辩，了解原稿的情况。现在的成果较之九年前的博士论文《“干城之选”——清代武举制度之设计、运作及其功效》，已在史料、论证、数字统计等多方面有了新的突破。一部博士论文经八年之久的修改才出版，这是不多见的，可见作者用功之勤。这八年，他坚持不懈，不断补充，不断完善（其间，我曾两次询问，他都回答还在修改之中），最终使该书在研究的深度、广度上都有了大幅度的提升，至少让我感觉是面目一新。
人们之所以赞誉“李著”，是因为以往研究武举考试的不多，特别是从制度层面研究的则更少，“李著”恰恰填补了这一空白。武科研究成果较少，原因有二。一是在科举时代，武科不如文科地位重要，在社会上的影响更是远不及文科。况且科举选官只是入仕之选，今后的升迁则靠个人的能力。文官靠官场上的政绩，武官则靠战场上的军功，因此对于武科出身者而言，军功更重于出身（“李著”也充分论述了这一点）。文科出身而统率军队者不乏其人。如康熙三十九年进士年羹尧于雍正初任抚远大将军，主持西北军务，平定罗卜藏丹津叛乱，有《年大将军兵法》传世。雍正时的著名军事将领张广泗、岳钟琪，均非武举出身。因为武科一直不受重视，研究者当然也就不多。二是武科留下的史料远不及文科那么丰富，这也造成武科研究的一定困难，让人望而止步。最早研究清代科举制度的专著是商衍鎏先生的《清代科举考试述录》，全书共八章，该书只是在第五章第一节讲武科，简单介绍了武童试、武乡试、武会试、武殿试。…]]></summary>

 As you may know, we went dark for over a week to protest a recent change announced by reddit.
 Here is a link to what is happening and why we went dark: https://www.reddit.com/r/ModCoord/comments/1476fkn/reddit_blackout_2023_save_3rd_party_apps/
 ​
  
Apollo made 7 billion requests last month, which would put it at about 1.7 million dollars per month, or 20 million US dollars per year. Even if I only kept subscription users, the average Apollo user uses 344 requests per day, which would cost $2.50 per month, which is over double what the subscription currently costs, so I'd be in the red every month.
  
We have received a message from the Admin team basically demanding that we stop the protest of the recent API changes or we will be removed: https://i.imgur.com/s7kM6j5.png
 The mod team is currently discussing ways to continue participating in the API protest without putting the subreddit at risk. A few ways that other subreddits have implemented are:
  
One day a week blackouts
 
Banning a specific letter and removing posts/comments that include that letter
 
Marking the subreddit as NSFW since this is all motivated by maximizing advertising revenue for their upcoming IPO
 
 ​
 The list of demands that need to be addressed as a result of this change: https://www.reddit.com/r/ModCoord/comments/148ks6u/indefinite_blackout_next_steps_polling_your/jo0pqzk/
 Please share your feedback and any suggestions you may have for showing our support to 3rd party apps and scripts that will be negatively impacted by this API change.

Or running a restaurant without looking at the price of your ingredients. Or constructing homes without looking at the price of raw materials... you get the idea.
That lack of transparency would be frightening, but hey, things could still work out, right?
Well, let's up the difficulty.
Imagine that, on top of not knowing exactly how much you were paying for your inputs, you also didn't know if you would have consistent and continued access to your wholesaler, your food supplier, or your building materials. That would almost certainly induce high blood pressure, stomach ulcers, and mild insomnia.

We built Autolabel because access to clean, labeled data is a huge bottleneck for most ML/data science teams. The most capable LLMs are able to label data with high accuracy, and at a fraction of the cost and time compared to manual labeling. With Autolabel, you can leverage LLMs to label any text dataset with https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36409201

is handled by the stable maintainers or the developers of the fixes.
However, due 
to some unhappiness in the XFS development
community with the process of handling stable fixes for that filesystem,
a different process has come about for backporting XFS patches to the
stable kernels.  The three developers doing that work, Leah Rumancik, Amir
Goldstein, and Chandan Babu Rajendra, led a plenary session at the 
2023 Linux Storage, Filesystem,
Memory-Management and BPF Summit  (with Rajendra
participating remotely)  to discuss that process.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[据阿里巴巴官微消息，6月20日，阿里巴巴控股集团董事会主席兼CEO张勇通过全员信宣布，阿里云智能集团完全分拆已经启动，正处于向上发展的最关键时期，必须全身心投入。同时为了适应未来发展规范和要求，其个人不宜再同时担任两家公司董事长与CEO职务。


经阿里巴巴控股集团董事会同意，张勇将于今年9月10日卸任阿里巴巴控股集团董事会主席兼CEO职务。张勇此后将专职担任阿里云智能集团董事长兼CEO，专注阿里云的发展，持续提升阿里云的行业竞争力与全球竞争力，让阿里云为各行业尤其中小企业的数智化升级提供更优质安全便捷的基础服务。同时，经过阿里巴巴控股集团董事会批准，集团执行副主席蔡崇信将出任阿里巴巴控股集团董事会主席；吴泳铭出任阿里巴巴控股集团CEO，同时继续兼任淘天集团董事长。


“过去24年间，我们有过很多次这样自我变革的时刻。如今，我们大家又一起站在一个新的起点上，开启一个通过自我变革、开辟未来发展的新阶段。”张勇在全员信中表示。



附：阿里巴巴集团董事会主席兼CEO张勇6月20日全员信


各位阿里人，


自从2015年5月担任阿里巴巴集团的CEO以来，我每年总会要给大家写几封信。也许大家已经习惯了，看到我发的全员信的时候，就知道公司又有重要的变化要发生。今天我又给大家写信了，给大家带来的是一个关于我自己的重要变化。


自今年3月宣布了集团“1+6+N”组织变革以后，目前各项工作都在平稳有序地推进。我们在上季度财报发布的时候公布了各业务集团董事会的组成，目前各个董事会都已经开始运行。我们也公布了各业务集团和业务单元的多个计划，包括将云智能集团从阿里集团完全分拆上市，以及菜鸟集团和盒马启动上市，海外数字商业集团的独立融资等等。整个阿里巴巴正以全新姿态奔向未来。


大家都知道，云计算、大数据和人工智能等核心技术的发展将会给社会带来巨大的变革，战略意义非常重大。目前云智能集团的完全分拆工作已经开始启动，正处于最关键时刻，要求必须全身心投入其中，同时也是考虑到分拆过程中公司规范化治理的要求，我个人不宜再同时担任两家集团的董事长和首席执行官的职责。因此，阿里巴巴集团董事会讨论并接受了我的请求：自2023年9月10日起，我将不再继续担任阿里巴巴集团董事会主席和首席执行官，而专心全职做好阿里云智能集团董事长兼首席执行官的工作。同时，阿里巴巴集团董事会决定，蔡崇信（Joe C. Tsai）将接替我成为阿里巴巴集团董事会主席，吴泳铭（Eddie Yongming Wu）将接替我成为阿里巴巴集团首席执行官。他们两位都是阿里巴巴的创始人和合伙人，都在阿里巴巴集团历史发展中做出了重要贡献，都拥有丰富的经验，相信在他们的领导下，公司能够走向更辉煌的未来。


这次的变化不仅对公司、对我个人都是另一个新阶段、新旅程的开始。时光过得真快，今年是我在阿里的第十六个年头。十六年一路同行，尤其是2015年接任集团首席执行官、2019年接任集团董事会主席以来，正是因为大家对我的信任、支持、鼓励和包容，让我在这个自己从未想象到的岗位上全情投入至今，对此我衷心地感激和感谢大家。这十六年来，因为社会进步、市场发展的时代机遇，我有幸和大家一起见证了阿里巴巴高速发展的历史阶段，参与了很多从无到有、从小到大、惠及普通人的生活、惠及企业数字化进程、惠及社会美好的创造；也和大家一起共同经受住了最近三年来新冠疫情的挑战和外部环境变化带来的种种考验。无论顺境还是逆境，我们一起不仅共同成长、共同经历、共同度过，也共同收获了很多比事业更宝贵的友谊和情义。


过去24年间，我们有过很多次这样自我变革的时刻。如今，我们大家又一起站在一个新的起点上，开启一个通过自我变革、开辟未来发展的新阶段。我相信大家会支持好Joe和吴泳铭等新一届集团高年级同学的工作，每个人都能够找到属于自己的舞台和属于自己的事业，最终能贡献社会、成就公司，也能够成就自己。我也会和云智能的同学们一起站在一个全新的舞台上，一起去探索利用云计算、大数据、人工智能的全新技术，服务于千行百业数字化、智能化的巨大前景，对此我充满憧憬和期待。


青山不改，绿水长流，创造一个新的江湖，再相会，任逍遥！

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[谷歌警告员工不要使用 Bard 生成的代码

谷歌对外宣传 Bard 有助于开发者提高工作效率，但它对内警告员工不要使用 Bard 生成的代码。谷歌解释称，它的内部使用禁令是因为 Bard 会产生不需要的代码建议，潜在会导致程序出现错误或过于复杂，软件过于臃肿，相比不使用 AI 辅助编程需要更多时间修复。该公司表示，它的目标是对其技术的局限性保持透明 —— Bard 会提出不想要的代码建议，但它还是有助于程序员。


消息来源：路透社



老王点评：合着还是拿用户做小白鼠啊，所以你放心使用 AI 生成的代码用在生产环境吗？




Reddit 抗议活动仍在继续中

上周一二，Reddit 版主们为了抗议 Reddit 的 API 定价政策而宣布关闭他们管理的子区，最高时期超过 90% 的子区变成了私有或限制发帖状态。直到一周后，仍有三千多个子区继续抗议，但最大的一些已经重新开放，不过这些子区将他们的抗议改为到张贴喜剧演员约翰·奥利弗的照片，“所有帖子都必须是约翰·奥利弗看起来很性感的图片”。Reddit 声称，它做出 API 价格改变是为了从 AI 需求中获利，AI 可以利用其托管的内容进行大型语言模型训练。


消息来源：The Register



老王点评：即便是迫于 IPO 压力，但我说，Reddit 这件事办的很糟糕，最后很可能是两败俱伤的结果。




Meta 宣布危险到不能公布代码的语音生成 AI 模型

Meta 公司昨天宣布了一个名为 Voicebox 的新人工智能模型，它说这是迄今为止功能最全面的语音生成器，“但由于滥用的潜在风险”，目前没有公开提供 Voicebox 模型或代码。该模型仍然只是一个研究项目，Meta 公司说它可以从短至两秒的样本中生成六种语言的语音，未来可用于 “自然、真实” 的翻译等方面。


消息来源：The Verge



老王点评：当一个 AI 已经不能被人类或 AI 识别时，很可能带来的风险超过收益。]]></summary>

KDE Plasma 桌面环境如今已经成为数百万用户的选择。借助活跃的开发者和社区的支持，它不断改进并推出与技术潮流相符的新功能。经过多年的发展，KDE 技术现在已经能够运行在桌面、笔记本电脑、平板电脑、手机和手持游戏设备上。这对于一个桌面环境来说是非常令人惊叹的，不是吗？

我经常听到或读到 KDE 桌面的各种问题，或者与 GNOME 相比被认为它的“选项太多”。我同意这些观点。但是我们不能忽视一个事实，尽管有这些争议和不同看法，KDE Plasma 桌面环境仍然是任何个人或企业使用场景的首选解决方案之一。它有一个成熟的路线图，采用独特的 Qt 技术构建，甚至能够在汽车和其他平台上运行。此外，它还有一个专门的基金会，拥有大量开发者，每天在努力改进这个桌面环境。

这就是为什么我撰写这篇文章的目的。有数百种 Linux 发行版支持 KDE Plasma 桌面环境。但是应该选择哪一个呢？它们各自有什么优势和劣势？哪一个对我来说最好？我们将在本文中尝试回答所有这些问题，并帮助你自行做出决策。

KDE Plasma 桌面的十大 Linux 发行版

我基于使用情况而非技术术语（如安装、终端使用等）编制了以下列表。

1、Kubuntu



Kubuntu 是 Ubuntu Linux 操作系统的官方 KDE Plasma 桌面版本。它使用与 Ubuntu 相同的基础软件包，并遵循 Ubuntu 的发布计划。这意味着它在 Ubuntu 发布新版本时也会发布新版本。由于基于 Ubuntu，你可以享受到伴随 Kubuntu 版本的庞大的帮助和支持社区。Kubuntu 是…]]></summary>

《郑孝胥日记》，中华书局1993年10月版

郑孝胥，字苏戡，一字太夷，因居所名曰“海藏楼”得号海藏，常以号行。福建闽侯人，生于苏州，长于福州。中国近现代著名诗人、书法家和政治家。1882年福建乡试解元，长期佐幕张之洞，备受器重。1903年两广总督岑春煊委为洋务处督办、营务处总办，驻军龙州，筹粮饷，开银号，办教育，卓有建树，允文允武，诚人生得意之秋，旋于1905年辞归上海。1911年诏任湖南布政使，未到任而清已亡，遂成为海上坚定的逊清遗老。1923年经陈宝琛引荐，入故宫任懋勤殿行走，1924年再任总理内务大臣，1925年任张园行在总务处总管，1932年伪满洲国成立后出任国务院总理兼文教部总长，走上“不归之路”，最后于1938年病死长春。
闽人闽菜，理所当然
郑孝胥在上海近二十年，从事路矿、金融、新闻、出版等事业，并多年担任商务印书馆董事长，其间诗酒风流，与遗老唱和，与时贤周旋，特别是组织或参与壬午同年会、一元会、消寒会等雅集活动，对我们了解早期闽、川菜馆在上海的发展及其与上海文化建设的关系，大有裨益，因为这是郑氏宴集最主要的两帮菜馆；之所以闽、川菜馆合论，则是因为早期上海闽菜与川菜风格特色相近，最典型的就是消闲别墅的菜品，常在闽川之间游移，以致时人莫辨，各种指南录之类书籍，便干脆标为闽川菜馆。
郑孝胥第一次在上海上餐馆，是1883年3月8日，进京赴试，经上海：“往滋卿处，同至聚丰园，邀叶小莱舅翁饮。”（引自《郑孝胥日记》，中华书局1993年10月版，以下引用该著不另出注）这聚丰园，从其新张开业广告来看，最初可能是家京菜馆：“启者：本园开设上洋四马路，精制满汉大菜、挂炉猪鸭、透味油鸡，四时佳肴，预定包办。外国大菜，一切鲜品，不另细载。谨择四月初一日开（业）。”（《新开聚丰园》，《申报》1877年4月30日第6版）后来杭州袭名而开的聚丰园正是京菜馆兼营番菜，适成佐证…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[文档查看器是每个 Linux 发行版的必备软件，可以用来阅读 PDF 等格式的文件。

Ubuntu 等发行版上的文档查看器一般是 GNOME 中的 Evince（LCTT 译注：读作 /ɪˈvɪns/）。Evince 支持多种文件格式，非常方便。

但是除了 Evince，还有很多其他的文档阅读应用。比如 Linux 上优秀的电子书阅读应用 Foliate（LCTT 译注：读作 /ˈfəʊlɪɪt/）。

最近我又发现了另一个文档查看器：Zathura。

用 Zathura 获得摆脱鼠标的阅读体验

Zathura 是一个高度可定制的文档查看器，基于 girara 用户界面 和几个文档库。girara 实现了一个简单、最小的用户界面。

Zathura 的加载速度极快。它极其简约，没有侧边栏、菜单栏等元素。（LCTT 译注：其实 Zathura 的界面没有那么单一，按 Tab 键可以显示索引页；Zathura 有一个 guioptions 选项来设置是否显示命令行、状态栏、水平滚动条、垂直滚动条等 GUI 元素。）



按 : 键可以打开 Zathura 的命令行提示符，按 Esc 键可以退出命令行。

如果要新建书签，可以输入 :bmark 后面跟想要对这个书签设置的索引号。



按 F 键可以高亮所有链接，每条链接附带一个序号，并且界面底部会显示命令行提示符。在命令行中输入链接对应的序号，按下回车可以用系统默认的浏览器打开该链接。



Zathura 还支持自动重新载入。如果文件被其他应用修改（LCTT 译注：比如在修改 LaTeX 源文件并重新编译得到新的 PDF 之后）， Zathura 会自动重载修改后的文件。

你还可以安装 插件 来扩展 Zathura 的功能，比如阅读 漫画comics 或 PostScript 文件。

tool that has many users today can easily be eclipsed by something better
next week.  Even in this environment, though, some programs endure for a
long time.  As an example, consider the
PostgreSQL database system, which traces its
history back to 1986.  Making fundamental changes to a large code base
with that much history is never an easy task.  As fundamental changes go,
moving PostgreSQL away from its process-oriented model is not a small one,

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi!
I’m Julien and I built a recommendation engine for Hacker News.
I feel like this website is a gold mine. Every day, I find some very interesting stories about a topic. And sometimes, I want to find other stories covering that same topic but I can’t.
Hacker News has years of history of awesome discussion and ressources. Unfortunately, I think HN Algolia isn’t helpful in searching these old threads. As a student, I want to learn a lot from this website.
This is why I created HN Recommend. Input a sentence or the URL of an article, and get the most popular and similar posts from Hacker News.
About the technical details, I've computed the embeddings of over 100,000 articles from HN and indexed it using Faiss. I made a blog post for a deeper explanation.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[PostgreSQL 超过 MySQL 成为开发者首选数据库

Stack Overflow 2023 年 5 月的调查显示，45.55% 的受访者使用 PostgreSQL，而 MySQL 为 41.09%，SQLite 为 30.9%。三年前，同样的调查中，MySQL 占 55.6%，PostgreSQL 占 36.1%。需要注意的是，这是一个开发者调查，它并不反映生产中的使用情况。此外，微软的 SQL Server 是排名最高的全商业数据库引擎，使用比例为 25.45%，比 2020 年的 33% 有所下降。


消息来源：Dev Class



老王点评：其实 PostgreSQL 在特性方面一直比 MySQL 好，但是这十多年来就一直被 MySQL 压着打。我接触的第一个开源数据库是 PostgreSQL 而不是 MySQL。现在似乎 MySQL 有点颓势了，而 PostgreSQL 多年的坚持得到了开发者们的认可。如果你是开发者，你会考虑选择哪个呢？




红帽准备开发 CentOS Stream 10

根据红帽工程师分享的 Fedora Enterprise Linux Next（ELN） 计划，推出 CentOS Stream 10 的进程正在进行中，这将最终形成 Red Hat Enterprise Linux（RHEL）10 的基础。预计将在 7 月把所有 Fedora ELN 内容大量导入 CentOS Stream 10。CentOS Stream 的目标是在明年 2 月的 Fedora 40 之前，不与 Fedora 分叉。预计 RHEL 10 将在 2025 年发布。


消息来源：Phoronix



老王点评：无论如何，我都觉得红帽放弃 CentOS 的战略是一大败笔，至少这件事可以做的更好。当然，任何决定背后都有其根本利益的驱动，红帽这样做无可厚非，只是如今这个局面可能是他们最初也没预料的吧。




英特尔简化其 CPU 品牌组合

英特尔已经宣布从下一代 Meteor Lake CPU 开始对其处理器品牌进行一些改变。最小的变化是，英特尔的主流 CPU 将失去其 “i”，从 Core i3/i5/i7/i9 转变为简单的 Core 3/5/7/9。英特尔还将停止在其处理器品牌中使用 “代” 的信息 —— 不会有被宣传为 “第 14 代” 的新 CPU，但会在 CPU 编号中包含世代编号。这是英特尔处理器品牌战略更广泛调整的一部分。去年，该公司放弃了低端笔记本电脑 CPU 的奔腾和赛扬品牌名称，它现在将这些英特尔处理器称为英特尔处理器。


消息来源：Ars Technica



老王点评：这些 CPU 厂商的命名真是有点随意，编号和实际的技术有时候有点脱节。]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[如果你正在找寻适合你的系统的完美发行版，那么选择基于 Ubuntu 的发行版的可能性非常高。

你可能会问为什么。

嗯，毫不奇怪，Ubuntu 是 最适合初学者的 Linux 发行版之一。它也非常流行，这就是为什么你会发现它拥有庞大的用户社区。不仅如此，它还广泛用于 云服务器 上。

因此，将 Ubuntu 作为 Linux 发行版的基础应该带来一些有用的优势，对吧？

这就是为什么我列出了基于 Ubuntu 的最佳发行版清单，希望你能找到一款足够出色，让你停止频繁更换发行版的选择。

1、Ubuntu 官方衍生版



如果你不喜欢 Ubuntu 官方提供的 GNOME 桌面环境，你可以尝试官方衍生版，它们在 Ubuntu 的基础上提供了不同的桌面环境。

简单来说，你将得到同样的 Ubuntu 使用体验，但拥有不同的用户界面。

为了让你的用户体验更加愉快，这些桌面环境已经进行了预调整和主题设置，这使它们成为了那些希望拿来即用的完美选择。

以下是可用的选项：


Kubuntu（KDE Plasma）

Lubuntu（最节约资源的选择，使用 LXDE/LXQT）

Ubuntu Studio（面向创作者的发行版）

Ubuntu Budgie（Budgie 桌面环境）

Ubuntu Kylin（专为中国用户定制）

Ubuntu MATE（使用 MATE 桌面和工具）

Xubuntu（Xfce 桌面）


此外，你还可以在 Ubuntu 22.10 中发现一个带有经典 Unity 桌面环境的新的官方衍生版，因为 Ubuntu Unity Remix 现已成为官方 Ubuntu 衍生版。


解析：我应该使用哪个 Ubuntu 版本？

2、Linux Mint

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[帕斯卡（尼克绘）

帕斯卡（Blaise Pascal）生于1623年6月19号，死于1662年8月19号，只活了三十九岁。十七世纪是所谓“天才的世纪”，弗朗西斯·培根死的时候，帕斯卡刚刚三岁；开普勒出版《世界的和谐》时，帕斯卡四岁；伽利略出版《两大世界的对话》时，帕斯卡九岁；霍布斯和伽利略在佛罗伦萨第一次见面时，帕斯卡大概十一岁。帕斯卡比他的法国同胞梅森（Marin Mersenne，1588生）、笛卡尔（1596生）、费马（1607生）以及英国人霍布斯（1588生）、意大利人托里拆利（1608生）晚一辈，又比牛顿（1642/1643生）和莱布尼兹（1646生）早一辈。和他同代的人有英格兰人沃里斯（1616生）和洛克（1632生）、荷兰人惠更斯（1629生），还有塞法迪犹太人斯宾诺莎（1632生）。1607年徐光启回上海老家守丧，三年后回京，利玛窦已逝，只翻译了六卷的《几何原本》就此搁置。徐光启死时，帕斯卡十岁。 
帕斯卡的父亲热爱数学和科学，在帕斯卡十一岁时去掉官职（一说卖掉一说让给弟弟），定居巴黎。帕父和神父出身的数学家梅森交好，梅森家是巴黎学者们聚会的沙龙，帕斯卡父子是常客。梅森府也被称为巴黎邮政局，因为他通过通信和欧洲的一百四十位数学家和科学家保持联系，研究成果到他这里汇总，再被他广播出去。梅森认为知识应该被广泛传播，这点和培根相似——中世纪教会保留的学术传统是知识应该保密，一元三次和四次方程的求解历史反映了当时数学家之间为了保密而引发的各种勾心斗角。梅森的通信网络也称“梅森学院”（Mersenne Academy），后来演变成非正式的“巴黎学院”，是法国科学院的前身。 

梅森

帕斯卡有个姐姐吉尔伯特，比他大三岁。她非常疼爱自己天才的弟弟，在帕斯卡死的当年，写过一本五十页的帕斯卡传记《帕斯卡先生的一生》，她的孩子们也努力维护舅舅的名声。帕斯卡有个妹妹雅克琳，比…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[这是一个新教程系列的开始。在这一篇中，你将熟悉 bash 脚本。


本系列假定你对 Linux 终端比较熟悉。你不必精通，但了解基础知识会很好。我建议阅读终端基础知识系列。

这个系列适合谁？

任何想开始学习 Bash Shell 脚本的人。

如果你是一名将 Shell 脚本作为课程的一部分的学生，那么本系列适合你。

如果你是普通的桌面 Linux 用户，本系列将帮助你了解在探索各种软件和修复程序时遇到的大多数 Shell 脚本。你还可以使用它来自动执行一些常见的重复性任务。

到本 Bash 基础系列结束时，你应该能够编写简单到中等水平的 Bash 脚本。

该系列的所有章节都有示例练习，你可以边做边学。


🚧 你将在这里学习 Bash Shell 脚本。虽然还有语法基本相同的其他 Shell，但它们的行为在某些方面仍然存在差异。Bash 是最常见和通用的 Shell，因此学习 Shell 脚本从 Bash 开始吧。


你的第一个 Shell 脚本：Hello World！

打开一个终端。现在 创建一个新目录 来保存你将在本系列中创建的所有脚本：

mkdir bash_scripts


现在 切换到这个新创建的目录：

cd bash_scripts


让我们在这里 创建一个新文件：

touch hello_world.sh


现在，编辑该文件 并向其中添加一行 echo Hello World。你可以使用 cat 命令的追加模式（使用 >）执行此操作：

[abhishek@itsfoss]:~/bash_scripts$ cat > hello_world.sh 
echo Hello World
^C


我更喜欢在使用 cat 命令添加文本时添加新行。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[仇恨的恶劣影响早已有之。但如今，新型通信技术进一步扩大了仇恨的规模和影响，发布仇恨言论已成为在全球范围内传播分裂言论和思想最常用的方法之一。6月18日是第二个打击仇恨言论国际日，联合国秘书长古特雷斯呼吁人们防止和消除这种破坏性的不良现象，促进包容、公正、和平的社区和社会。


古特雷斯表示，仇恨言论被用来煽动恐惧和分裂，往往是为了政治利益，给社区和社会带来巨大代价。仇恨言论煽动暴力，加剧紧张关系，阻碍促进调解和对话的努力。与此同时，仇恨言论还是种族灭绝和其他暴行罪的征兆之一。但在仇恨言论面前，我们远非无能为力。我们可以而且必须提高对其危险性的认识，并努力防止和消除所有形式的仇恨言论。


与此同时，古特雷斯对借口打击仇恨言论实则侵犯人权的行为发出警示。他指出，对仇恨言论错误和模棱两可的反应，包括全面禁止和关闭互联网，也可能因限制言论和表达自由而侵犯人权。他警告说，这甚至可能使一些最适合反击仇恨言论的人——人权维护者和记者保持沉默。


他指出，联合国正在就数字平台信息完整性自愿行为准则与各国政府、技术公司和其他方面进行磋商，以减少错误和虚假信息及仇恨言论的传播，同时保护表达自由。

AI 模型是建立在人类劳动的基础之上的，高质量的数据标注对 AI 模型至关重要，AI 公司通常会雇佣廉价的众包工人做一些数据标注工作。但研究显示，随着 AI 聊天机器人，如 ChatGPT 的流行，众包工人开始利用 AI 做这些数据标注的工作。瑞士洛桑联邦理工学院的研究人员招募了 44 名众包工人来对 16 篇医学研究论文总结摘要，根据记录的击键情况，比如按下复制快捷键等，他们估计有 33-46% 的摘要文本是用 AI 生成的。


消息来源：The Register



老王点评：还记得前两天我们的#1032 期报道吗，显然这种 AI 吃 AI 的狗粮的事情已经在发生，并且会越来越多。而且，AI 真的能分清楚哪些是 AI 生成的么？可能会越来越难。




FreeBSD 本月庆祝其三十岁生日

1993 年 6 月 19 日，从 386BSD 项目中分裂出来的 FreeBSD 正式有了这个名字。但第一个正式版本直到 1993 年 11 月才发布。FreeBSD 14 将于未来几个月后发布，晚于预期计划。


消息来源：FreeBSD



老王点评：虽然不如 Linux 那么流行，但是 FreeBSD 仍然是一个独特而重要的操作系统。当然，这里面故事很多，感兴趣的朋友可以了解一下。




GPT-4 生成的商业计划书更受投资者青睐

虽然用 AI 撰写商业计划书能节约很多时间，但更重要的是，AI 撰写的比人类撰写的更好，更吸引投资。有公司邀请了数百名投资者和企业主对一组由人类创造和 GPT-4 生成的商业计划书进行评分，他们并不知道有 AI 参与撰写。而且，其中人类撰写的计划书来自于已经获得融资的成功案例。结果显示 GPT-4 生成的商业计划书比人类更有效，被认为在质量、关键要素描述和问题描述上胜过人类。调查显示，在投资者和企业主阅读了 GPT-4 的计划书之后，投资可能性为人类的三倍，他们认为 AI 生成计划书的说服力是人类的两倍。

老王点评：投资人可能会想，那我为什么不直接投资 AI 创建的企业呢？这一天或许不远了。]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[胡晓江（章静绘）

胡先骕（1894-1968）先生是中国植物学的奠基人，在中国近代科学史上具有重要地位，同时也是中国近代文学史上的重要人物，在新文化浪潮汹涌澎湃的年代，他始终坚持文化保守主义的立场，创作了大量诗词古文。此外，他还是一位教育家和有高度责任感的社会评论家。2023年5月24日，时值胡先骕一百三十岁虚岁诞辰，《胡先骕全集》在国家植物园举行了首发式。《全集》主编、北京师范大学教授胡晓江是胡先骕的孙女。在接受《上海书评》专访时，她讲述了《全集》的编纂过程，并对祖父胡先骕的生平及学术做了介绍。

《胡先骕全集》（共十九卷），江西人民出版社2023年5月版

能请您聊聊《胡先骕全集》的缘起吗？
胡晓江：《全集》是从2014年启动的。胡先骕是1894年生人，2014年是他的诞辰一百二十周年，江西师范大学举办了很大规模的“胡先骕教育思想研讨会”。江西师范大学是国立中正大学的“嫡传”，胡先骕是中正大学的首任校长。在会议期间有人提出，是时候为胡先骕编一部《全集》了。当然，这并非一时兴起，而是早已有了积累。对胡先骕有一点了解的人，都知道胡先骕不仅是一位科学家，还特别能写，他写诗、写文学批评、写社会评论，身后留下了很多文字。所以，对他的文章著作的搜集、整理，以及对他生平的研究，从上世纪八十年代就已经开始了。最早是中正大学在台湾的校友谭峙军先生，他对老校长念念不忘，晚年花了很多时间搜集、整理胡先骕发表在各处的诗词。在胡先骕百年诞辰的时候出版了《胡先骕先生诗集》（中正大学台湾校友会，1992年）。后来，胡先骕的另一位学生张大为和我的大伯父胡德熙、我父亲胡德焜一起，编了两卷本《胡先骕文存》（江西高校出版社，1995、1996年）。此外，学者胡宗刚在他担任研究员的庐山植物园发现了很多与胡先骕相关的档案资料，在此基础上做了很多研究，写了传记《不该遗忘的胡先骕》（长江文艺出版社，2005年），…]]></summary>

去年 12 月刚刚换了工作用的笔记本电脑后，我意识到我有多么喜欢给我的工作设备贴贴纸。这些贴纸有些是过去活动的纪念品，有些是我热衷的项目的标志，还有一些则只是为了好玩！

因为好奇别人的笔记本上贴了什么，我对周围的同事朋友问了一圈。

无障碍倡导者



这是我的工作笔记本电脑（你能看出我对 Drupal 的热爱吗）。我最喜欢的贴纸是有轮椅的 Druplicon... 当 Drupal 8 发布时，我们把这个标志 和轮椅结合在一起，因为我所在的机构专注于无障碍性。

— AmyJune Hineline

充满活力的 Java



自从我还是个孩子的时候，我的电脑和其他东西上就一直有贴纸。我认为我最喜欢的要么是 “Tux”，要么是 “Linux Inside”。它们大多与领域相关，只有一些不相关的。在右下角，我有一个运行在“汤姆猫”上的 Java 贴纸（哈哈）- 这是我职业生涯中花费大部分时间的领域。

— Alan Formy-Duval

实用目的



嗯，我没有贴任何贴纸。然而，我在我的两台笔记本电脑上粘了绒面条，用来固定我的移动硬盘，这样我在公交车上玩游戏时就不会掉落了。我还粘了一个锁槽。

— Rikard Grossman-Nielsen

保持外观



虽然这不是最装饰得最多的笔记本电脑，但我喜欢这套集合（你知道的，很难在没有旅行的情况下获得更多！）

我最喜欢的是“最后一个提交的人是维护者”。这是对维护状态的讽刺性评论，也承诺代码将因此而继续存在。

主要是关于我使用或贡献的事物，我认为有意义，或者只是觉得这个贴纸很棒。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[出于研究目的需要下载 YouTube 视频吗？ Tube Downloader 可以提供帮助。




找到了你想要保存以供离线使用的 YouTube 视频，同时又想不选择他们的付费计划？

好吧，那么你可以使用 Tube Downloader。它是 “yt-dlp” 的前端，提供了一些简洁的功能。


🚧 未经许可下载 YouTube 视频是违反平台政策的。因此，这些工具在官方商店中不可用。我们不鼓励你将该工具用于非法目的，仅提及该工具用于研究和实验目的。


Tube Downloader：概述 ⭐



Tube Downloader 主要使用 C# 编写，是一个跨平台的开源工具，可让你轻松直接从 YouTube 下载视频。

请允许我向你展示此应用的功能。

当你启动应用时，“添加下载Add Download”按钮会显示一个友好的问候语。单击它以添加 YouTube 视频 URL，然后单击“验证Validate”。



当你这样做时，你将看到用于选择文件格式、质量、字幕、保存位置等的选项。


📋 你可以选择 MP3 作为仅下载音频的文件格式。


单击“下载Download”开始下载视频。



你会在主页面上看到下载进度，你可以在其中看到视频的标题以及 URL 和下载速度。

此外，Tube Downloader 在下载完成时显示通知； 但是当我测试它时，它有点不稳定。



那不是全部。Tube Downloader 也有一些不错的自定义选项，例如：


适配系统主题。

在后台运行。

能够限制最大并发下载量。

设置下载速度限制。

选择使用 “Aria2” 作为替代下载器。

启用/禁用在下载的视频中包含元数据。

停止/重试所有下载并清除所有排队的下载。




这些可以从功能区菜单下的“首选项Preferences”访问。

看到 Linux 客户端工作得相当好，Tube Downloader 对于下载那些令人上瘾的快乐的猫咪模因和其他东西是很有用的 🐱 （我们不做评价）。

📥 获取 Tube Downloader

Tube Downloader 可在 Linux 和 Windows 中的 Flathub、Snap 商店 和 微软商店 中获取 。


Tube Downloader（Flathub）


你还可以在 GitHub 上查看其源代码。

你想知道我从 YouTube 下载了哪些视频吗？ 🤔好吧，你可以在我们的 YouTube 频道 上查看这些内容。

这个名为 Tunnel Falls 的处理器是一款 12 量子比特的芯片，虽然远远落后于英特尔的许多竞争对手的量子比特数量，但英特尔正试图建立基于硅的量子比特，而其它的量子处理器厂商都在通过云服务提供量子处理器。这些量子比特基于“量子点”，这些结构比材料中的电子波长还要小。量子点可以用来捕获单个电子，然后可以处理电子的特性来存储量子信息。英特尔利用其制造专长来制作量子点，并创造出设置和读取其状态以及执行操作所需的所有邻近功能。

谷歌利用 YouTube 开发其下一代人工智能

据透露，谷歌的研究人员一直在利用 YouTube 开发其下一个大型语言模型 “双子座Gemini”，该模型展示了在其他任何模型中都看不到的多模态能力。而 OpenAI 也已经秘密地使用了 YouTube 的数据来训练其一些人工智能模型，但谷歌能够拥有 YouTube 更全面的视频数据。人工智能开发者在寻找用于训练和改进模型的高质量数据方面面临着新的障碍。从 Reddit 到 Stack Exchange 再到 DeviantArt 的主要网站出版商正越来越多地阻止开发者为该目的下载数据。


消息来源：The Information



老王点评：人工智能下面一个竞争优势就是，看谁拥有大量的数据。所以，我有点明白 Reddit、Twitter 为什么要对其 API 收高价了，可能广告的流失可能并不是主要的原因，因为这种情况并不是第一天存在了。




Meta 公司希望人们能利用其开源人工智能赚钱

Meta 公司正在研究如何将其开源的大语言模型的下一个版本用于商业用途，他们希望其他公司自由使用 Meta 正在开发的新人工智能软件并从中获利，这一决定可能会对其他人工智能开发者和越来越多地采用它的企业产生重大影响。随着开发者采用和改进这些 Meta 开源的模型或修补其安全漏洞，Meta 也将能够把这些改进纳入其自己的消费者和广告产品的人工智能模型中。


消息来源：The Information



老王点评：Meta 公司显然是走一条弯道超车的方法，走开源的路，让其它人无路可走。]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[软件自由保护协会Software Freedom Conservancy（SFC）是一家由开源倡导者组成的非营利性社区。今天（本文原文发表于 2022 年 7 月 5 日），它发布了一篇抨击性的博文，宣布退出 GitHub，并请求其成员及支持者公开谴责该平台。SFC 与 GitHub 的如此纷争，源于这一颇受指责的举动：微软和 OpenAI 训练了一个名为 Copilot 的 AI 系统，而其训练数据的来源，是那些使用了开源许可证公开的代码。开源代码不是捐款箱，不是想拿多少就拿多少，想怎么用就怎么用的。

它更像是摄影作品。即便摄影师没有向你收取照片的使用费，你仍需要在该署名的地方进行署上来源。据 SFC 的一篇 博文 所述，Copilot 在使用他人的代码片段时，并没有保留来源信息：

“这反映了 GitHub 长期以来的问题，也是我们必须一齐放弃 GitHub 的关键原因。从 Copilot 中，从 GitHub 的代码托管服务中，从我们所见的基本每个领域，我们都发现 GitHub 的行为比其同行要差得多。我们也不相信 Amazon、Atlassian、GitLab 等其他盈利性的代码托管平台，能有杰出的表现。然而，将 GitHub 的行为与其同行相对比较一下，就能发现 GitHub 的行为要差得多了。”

GitHub 是全世界事实上的开源代码仓库。它是 YouTube、Twitter 和 Reddit 的混合体，但专为程序员及其代码服务。自然，替代品是有的。但是，从一个代码仓库生态切换到另一个，并不等同于用 Instagram 来替代 TikTok。微软在 2018 年花了 70 多亿美元来收购 GitHub。从那时起，微软就利用其 OpenAI 的主要受益者的地位，来共同开发 Copilot。并且，要访问 Copilot 服务，只能通过微软的特别邀请，或者支付订阅费。该举激怒了 SFC 及其他开源倡导者，因为微软和 OpenAI 实际上在将他人的代码货币化，同时让使用这些代码的人们不能正确地表明归属信息。

Copilot 必须毁灭。或者，微软和 OpenAI 可以造一台时光机，然后穿越到过去，将 Copilot 数据库中的每一点数据做标记，从而能够为所有输出提供正确的署名。但是，与其去关心你产品或者服务中的伦理问题，不如去鼓动人们，去开拓那荒野西部似的监管环境，后者总是更加简单的。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[pipx 解决了流行的 pip 工具的不足之处。学习在 Linux 中安装和使用 pipx。


pip 是一种流行的工具，用于从 Python 包索引 中安装 Python 包和模块。

然而，在最近的发行版本中，pip 用户遇到了 外部管理环境错误。



这是为避免通过 pip 安装的 Python 包与本机包管理器之间发生冲突而添加的“功能”。Python 希望你使用单独的虚拟环境，而不是通过 pip 在全局安装包。

这就是 pipx 发挥作用的地方。它为你安装的每个应用创建一个新的虚拟环境，然后在全局级别的 /bin 中创建到本地二进制文件的链接。这一切都是自动的。它为你节省时间和精力。

让我们看看如何在 Ubuntu 和其他 Linux 发行版上安装和使用 pipx。

在 Ubuntu 和其他 Linux 上安装 pipx

安装很简单，可以在 Ubuntu 和 Debian 上使用以下命令安装：

sudo apt update && sudo apt install pipx


对于其他发行版，请使用你的包管理器并安装它。

完成安装后，将其添加到 $PATH 以便可以从任何地方访问它：

pipx ensurepath




关闭终端并重新启动它。这就完成了！ 现在，让我们看看如何使用它。

使用 pipx

包管理器的主要用途是什么？ 软件包安装、更新和删除。

让我向你展示如何使用 pipx 执行以下操作：


搜索包

包安装

升级

包移除


让我们从安装开始。

如何使用 pipx 安装包

要使用 pipx 安装包，你必须遵循一个简单的命令语法：

pipx install <package_name>


例如，在这里，我安装了一个非常有用的程序 Cowsay：

pipx install cowsay




同样，如果你想安装特定版本的包，你必须在 == 后跟上版本号，如下所示：

pipx install package==version


例如，在这里，我安装了 1.24.1 版本的 numpy：

pipx install numpy==1.24.1




如何搜索包

pipx 程序没有搜索功能（因为 PyPI 的 API 使用限制）但这并不意味着你不能搜索 Python 包。

要搜索包，你需要安装 pypisearch：

pipx install pypisearch


完成后，你可以使用 pypisearch 命令搜索包：

pypisearch python_package_name


在这里，我搜索了 neofetch：



如何使用 pipx 升级包

与任何其他现代包管理器一样，你可以一次升级所有包，也可以一次升级一个包。

要一次升级所有软件包，你只需执行以下命令：

pipx upgrade-all




如你所见，它将 numpy 升级到最新版本。

但是如果你想升级一个特定的包，你可以这样做：

pipx upgrade package-name


假设我想将 cowsay 包升级到最新版本，那么，我将使用以下命令：

pipx upgrade cowsay




如何使用 pipx 卸载包

要删除包，你必须使用 uninstall 标志，如下所示：

pipx uninstall package_name


为了供你参考，在这里，我从我的系统中删除了 numpy：

pipx uninstall numpy




pip 还是 pipx？

对 pip 的限制影响了最终用户对它的使用。值得庆幸的是，pipx 提供了急需的替代方案。它符合使用虚拟环境的 Python 准则，同时允许已安装的应用在全局范围内可用。

对于不是 Python 应用开发的最终用户，这提供了使用发行版仓库中不可用的 Python 应用的选项。

希望本教程对你有所帮助。如果你有任何问题或建议，请告诉我。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[昆汀·塔伦蒂诺（Quentin Tarantino），1963年3月27日生于美国田纳西州的挪克斯维尔，美国导演、编剧、演员、制作人。他电影的特色为非线性叙事的剧情、讽刺题材、暴力美学、架空历史以及新黑色电影的风格。有人曾说，近二十年内，对当代好莱坞影响最大的三位导演，当属昆汀·塔伦蒂诺、詹姆斯·卡梅隆和克里斯托弗·诺兰。


昆汀·塔伦蒂诺的电影叫好又叫座。他曾获得多项大奖，其中包括两座奥斯卡金像奖、四座金球奖、两座英国电影学院奖和金棕榈奖，并还提名过黄金时段艾美奖与格莱美奖。他受《时代杂志》于2005年评为“全球100名最具影响力的人物”。影评人及历史学家彼得·博格丹诺维奇也曾称他为“在他那世代中最有影响力的导演”。


昆汀曾说，自己这一生只拍十部电影，拍完就金盆洗手。昆汀自29岁开始执导第一部长片电影，27年间，由昆汀独立完成的有九部电影，每部都是经典之作，可以说，从未失手。


下面我们就盘点一下昆汀的这九部电影。


《落水狗》


这部电影是塔伦蒂诺的处女作，展现了他独特的对话风格，黑色幽默，暴力美学和非线性叙事。影片开头就是大段话唠，几个人的个性鲜明，故事讲述了一群不知道彼此真实身份的劫匪在一次抢劫珠宝店的过程中遭遇了警方的埋伏，随后在一个仓库里相互怀疑，想要揪出卧底的故事。很想知道，最后卧底告诉白先生自己是警察后，白先生的心理阴影。





《低俗小说》


影片情节跌宕起伏，剧情引人入胜，人物形象特色分明，叙事和拍摄手法非常独特，剧情的切换幅度很大。“低俗”的内容充斥着影片：性、毒品、暴力、杀人、抢劫、黑帮等等，人物形象特色分明，长得都很有喜感，演员表演也很经典，风情万种的蜜尔（很正点），备受老大女人诱惑的文森（风流倜傥，死的很冤），“放下屠刀，立地成佛”的黑人杀手朱思（从杀手到哲学家），倒霉的黑帮老大（暴菊黑屋子的剧情太搞了），优雅处事且老道的沃夫先生（专门帮忙解决麻烦），在餐馆抢劫的搞笑男女劫匪（笨贼一箩筐）。布鲁斯·威利斯竟然在里面做配角拳击手，实在浪费。拳击手的女友娇小柔弱，和彪悍的拳击手配在一起真绝了。 





《危险关系》


这部片大概是昆汀·塔伦蒂诺电影里知名度最低的之一，感觉女主角选的不好，让人没啥印象（可能主要原因是不好看），女配角的命运还真惨，莫名其妙就当了枪下亡魂。





《杀死比尔》


影片讲述了女主角在自己的婚礼上遭到了前任恋人“比尔”和他的杀手团队的袭击，陷入了昏迷四年的状态，醒来后决心报复的故事。画面血腥，昆汀暴力美学的经典之作。





《金刚不坏》


讲述了一个变态杀手驾驶着一辆改装过的汽车，专门追杀年轻女子的故事。这部B级片相对昆汀的其他作品来说并不出众，话唠的内容不如《低俗小说》，血腥的内容不如《杀死比尔》，前半部分使用胶片电影滤镜，很有胶片感，影片依旧是暴力、血腥，影片中间的一段舞曲《Down in Mexico》令人印象深刻，明确表明昆汀依旧恋足。





《无耻混蛋》


美丽少女苏珊娜的悲惨身世颇令人同情，她身负灭门的血海深仇，每一天都活在复仇的回忆中，她面对德军的勇气，谋划复仇计划的谋略也令人佩服和欣赏，然而，导演不会给观众一段《基督山复仇记》一般的完美情节，在最后计划几乎已经快要实施成功的时候，用一段教课书式的“暴力美学”结束了少女的生命，令人唏嘘不已。 看过这片子后，感觉很纠结。影片看起来感觉很爽，又有些感觉不爽，影片好像挺文雅，但似乎又好像挺流氓，影片似乎是抗德神剧，但似乎又有哪里不对。 不用纠结了，昆汀·塔伦蒂诺的神剧，看就是了。





《被解救的姜戈》


影片讲述了一位名叫姜戈的黑人奴隶，在一位白人赏金猎人的帮助下获得了自由并解救自己的妻子的故事。克里斯托弗·瓦尔兹扮演的赏金猎人令人印象深刻，他处决治安官那段剧情简直令人拍手叫绝。





《八恶人》


剧情发生在南北战争结束后不久，八个陌生人因为暴风雪而被困在一间客栈，每个人都隐藏着不同的秘密和目的，而这间客栈也成为了一座充满死亡和血腥的战场。《八恶人》和《龙门客栈》有很多相似之处，都是在客栈等候并伏击押送的犯人，都有一扇被反复踹开的门，一个是在酒里下毒，一个是在咖啡下毒，不同的是，本片有大量昆汀风格的话痨、血浆以及爆蛋。





《好莱坞往事》


这部电影对观众的要求很高，观众如果不知道1969年轰动洛杉矶的“曼森杀人案”的详细经过，以及嬉皮士运动的历史，那么看这部电影一定是莫名其妙一头雾水，心里想着，这导演拍的什么玩意儿。为了不影响观影效果，建议看前先了解一下“曼森杀人案”的背景和经过。]]></summary>

process for getting it upstream, were the topics
of a session led remotely by 
Kent Overstreet, creator of bcachefs, at the 
2023 Linux Storage, Filesystem,
Memory-Management and BPF Summit.  He has also discussed bcachefs in
previous editions of the summit, first
in 2018 and at last year's event;
in both of those cases, the question of getting bcachefs merged
into the mainline kernel came up, but that merge has not happened yet.

around, though, Overstreet seemed

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Reddit 威胁换掉继续抗议的子区管理员

本周初，数千 Reddit 子区 闭版 以抗议 Reddit API 的天价收费，因为这事实上扼杀了管理员们赖以执行管理操作的第三方客户端。Reddit CEO 对员工 表示 不要担心，因为抗议不会影响公司收入。他称，“大部分子区会按计划在周三回归，我们干好自己的工作就行了”。周三，部分子区陆续恢复，但也有很多子区将继续保持关闭 —— 直到 Reddit 改变其政策。目前还有超过一半的子区保持关闭或限制，这包括订阅数超过四千万的 r/funny、超过三千万的 r/aww、r/Music 等。此外，Reddit 还威胁将移除继续抗议的管理员。Reddit 宣称，如果一个子区的管理团队一致同意停止管理社区，它将邀请愿意管理社区的新管理员来管理社区；而如果至少有一名管理员愿意维持社区运作，Reddit 将移除不想管理社区的管理员。


消息来源：Hacker News



老王点评：真是要硬扛到底啊，这不是移除几个“刺头”管理员就能解决问题的，相信这样的抗议也代表了大部分社区中坚的意见。无论如何，这都是一幕罕见的大规模社区对抗事件，让我们拭目以待。




YouTube 通知其开源替代品 Invidious 关闭

Invidious 是 YouTube 的一个开源 “替代前端”，允许用户在没有数据跟踪的情况下观看 YouTube 视频，也可以让用户在观看视频时不被 “恼人的广告” 打断。YouTube 声称该软件违反了其 API 政策，称它没有显示 YouTube 服务条款的链接，也没有 “明确” 解释其对用户信息的处理。YouTube 要求它在 7 天内关闭。


消息来源：VICE



老王点评：看来开放 API 将全面进入关闭时代，各个网站都开始扼杀这些妨碍其广告业务的客户端了。或许在官方看来，这些利用其 API 的第三方客户端就是在对它们吸血。




Alphabet 出售了谷歌域名产品

Alphabet 正在结束其谷歌域名业务，并将其资产以约 1.8 亿美元的价格出售给 SquareSpace。这些资产包括“在谷歌域名业务上托管的 1000 万个域名，分布在数百万个客户中”。谷歌域名业务于 2014 年推出，在 2022 年退出了测试阶段。它拥有诸多新的顶级域名，是 HTTPS 的主要支持者之一。


消息来源：9to5google



老王点评：谷歌连域名这么重要的基础设施服务都开始砍掉，以后还能信任谷歌在基础设施方面的持续性么？]]></summary>

任何一个转弯都可能引向天堂
或者，任何角落都可能隐藏着地狱
道路闪亮，像雨后上山的河流。
——爱德华·托马斯
1914年12月至1917年1月，在战争的阴霾下，爱德华·托马斯（Edward Thomas）用生命的最后两年时间创作了他一生的诗篇。1917年1月13日，托马斯写下最后一首诗《真爱的悲哀》，两周后，他作为英国皇家炮兵部队少尉赴法国前线。4月9日，在阿拉斯（Arras）“复活节反攻”时被德军炮弹击中身亡。托马斯的一百四十二首诗作在其身后结集出版，被认为是那个时代最伟大的诗歌成就之一。作为十六位战争诗人之一，他的名字被镌刻在伦敦西敏寺诗人角的一块纪念碑上。
爱德华·托马斯生于1878年，十九岁出版第一本散文集《林地生活》。到1914年，在成为诗人之前，他已是著名散文家、传记作家和深具影响力的文学批评家，被《泰晤士报》称为“拥有英格兰诗歌天堂钥匙的人”。那一时期，托马斯还实验性地创作了冥想散文、印象派小说、神话、奇幻故事与寓言，他的写作实践几乎涵盖了所有的文学体裁，如果不是过人的文学禀赋，他或许也会以纯粹的博物学家、自然学家、地形学家、民俗学家或社会历史学家的身份来写作。托马斯广泛而独到的评论遍及自乔叟时代到他同时代的文学作品，既以非凡的洞察力评论同时代作家（哈代、叶芝、劳伦斯、庞德等），也敏锐地倾注于当时名不见经传的文学新人。他第一个意识到威廉·亨利·戴维斯（W. H. Davies）、德拉梅尔（Walter de la Mare）和弗罗斯特的诗歌才华。他积极评价戴维斯的处女作，并鼓励他写下在北美的狂野经历《一个超级流浪汉的自传》，这本书被出版商拒绝，托马斯帮助获得萧伯纳的前言，助力出版；托马斯在评论弗罗斯特的《波士顿以北》…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[在 Linux 中无法打开 AVIF 图片？AVIF 是一种新的网络图像文件格式，下面是在 Linux 桌面上查看 AVIF 图像的方法。


就质量而言，PNG 是最好的，但它们体积庞大，因此不适合用于网站。

JPEG 会减小文件大小，但会显着降低图像质量。

WebP 是一种相对较新的格式，可以生成尺寸更小、质量更好的图像。

现在，AVIF 是一种新的文件格式，可以在不牺牲质量的情况下压缩图像。对于相同的图像质量，它们比 WebP 更小。

最近 Linux 已开始提供 WebP 支持。但是，许多发行版默认不支持 AVIF 图像格式。

如果你从网络上下载 AVIF 格式的图像，它不会显示缩略图。



如果你尝试使用默认图像查看器打开它，它很可能会显示“无法识别的图像文件格式”错误。



那么，解决方案是什么？ 在 Linux 上根本看不了 AVIF 图像吗？

不，事实并非如此。对于 Linux，总有一种解决方法。

在 Linux 中查看 AVIF 图像文件

有一个名为 gThumb 的便捷 图像查看器，可用于在 Linux 上打开 AVIF 图像。

如果不是全部的话，它应该在大多数 Linux 发行版的仓库中可用。

在 Ubuntu 和基于 Debian 的发行版上，使用以下命令安装 gThumb。

sudo apt install gthumb




安装后，选择一张 AVIF 图像，右键单击它并选择“打开方式Open With”选项。在这里，选择 gThumb，将其设为 AVIF 图像的默认值并打开它。



gThumb 在打开的图像下以缩略图格式显示同一文件夹中的所有图像。



使用 gThumb 打开 AVIF 图像后，它们也应该以缩略图显示。



就是这样。你现在可以在 Linux 桌面上欣赏 AVIF 图像。

总结

gThumb 是一个用途极为广泛且功能强大的应用。这让我想知道为什么它不被用作 GNOME 或其他桌面环境和发行版中的默认图像查看器。

关于 Linux 中默认的 AVIF 支持，迟早会添加。目前，gThumb 完成了这项工作。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[我们将介绍一些最佳的虚拟化程序，为用户创建/管理虚拟机提供便利。


虚拟化软件由于其用途和好处而广泛使用，你可以使用它来体验、测试或运行需要特定操作系统版本的软件。

虚拟化提供了一个抽象的计算机硬件概念，帮助你创建虚拟机（VM）、网络、存储等。其好处包括隔离性、安全性和自由度高，可以尽情测试各种事物。

不同类型的虚拟化软件分别适用于桌面用户、服务器管理员和企业用户。

在列出各种虚拟化软件的同时，我还会提到适用对象。

1、VirtualBox



VirtualBox 是一款备受赞誉的开源虚拟机程序，适用于 Linux、Windows 和 macOS。

它适用于各种类型的用户，无论你只是想在虚拟机上运行 Linux，还是想创建一个用于测试的虚拟机，或者是企业需要一个虚拟机解决方案。

对大多数用户来说，它可以被视为一个全能解决方案。虽然它主要适用于桌面使用，但你可以尝试其无头headless模式，通过查阅其 文档，将虚拟机作为远程桌面服务器运行。

主要亮点：


支持广泛的客户操作系统

简单的用户界面和快速的性能

定期更新

功能丰富


2、OpenVZ



想在服务器上创建隔离的 Linux 容器吗？OpenVZ 可以帮助你。

你可以创建行为类似于独立服务器的容器。这些容器具备帮助你高效管理的所有基本功能。

由于 OpenVZ 是作为 Linux 发行版构建和分发的，因此容器仅运行于 Linux 上。

对于初学者来说，OpenVZ 是学习使用容器的绝佳选择，因为它易于配置和管理。此外，与其他一些方案相比，基于 OpenVZ 的 VPS 托管价格实惠。

主要亮点：


资源利用效率高

使用和管理简单


3、KVM

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The C language does not provide the sort of resource-management features
found in more recent languages.  As a result, bugs involving
leaked memory or failure to release a lock are relatively common in
programs written in C — including the kernel.  The kernel project has never
limited itself to the language features found in the C standard, though;
kernel developers will happily
use extensions provided by compilers if they prove helpful.  It looks like
a relatively simple compiler-provided feature may lead to a significant
change in some common kernel coding patterns.]]></summary>

repair for a number of years 
and things are getting to the point where most of the filesystem-internal work
has been completed and is under review.  The work remaining mostly concerns
the user-space side 
to set up a periodic scan and repair cycle, so he wanted to discuss what
user space needs from this kind of feature in a filesystem session at the 
2023 Linux Storage, Filesystem,
Memory-Management and BPF Summit that he led remotely.  The session may
not have gone quite as he hoped, as it got somewhat derailed by topics that
spilled over from the earlier session on
unprivileged image mounts.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[安卓开源项目将不是一个完整的开源移动操作系统

安卓开源项目（AOSP）是安卓系统开源的部分，但谷歌不断地将其中一些部分抽取到其私有的谷歌服务框架。最近，谷歌又废弃了 AOSP 中的拨号和消息应用程序，谷歌称，“这个应用程序没有得到积极的支持，其源代码只作为参考。这个项目将在未来的某个时候从源代码清单中删除。”虽然每个安卓 OEM 厂商都已经使用了他们自己的拨号和消息应用，而且也有比谷歌更好的开源替代品，但对于安卓这个开源操作系统来说，由于 AOSP 的功能不断地被转移到闭源的谷歌服务框架中，你将不能说 AOSP 是一个完整的开源移动操作系统了。


消息来源：OS News



老王点评：从谷歌删除“不作恶”信条那时起，开源就不断被它践踏。当然，这并不是谷歌做的有多差，或者违背了开源许可证，在这方面比它差的比比皆是。叹息的是，终究很多公司只是将开源当成一件需要利用时披上的华丽衣服，而在金钱当道时就如旧衣一样丢弃。




Debian 13 将支持 RISC-V 64

Debian 12 已经正式发布，官方支持 AMD64、AArch64、i386、POWER 等架构，但不支持 RISC-V 64 位。不过，对 RISC-V 64 位的移植正在取得良好的进展。在一年半到两年后的 Debian 13 版本中，预计会有对 RISC-V 64 位的支持。考虑到许多社区开源开发者缺乏高性能 RISC-V 硬件，这也是可以理解的。


消息来源：Phoronix



老王点评：如果 Debian 能够支持高性能 RISC-V 架构，将从根本上推动 RISC-V 的发展。




生成型人工智能每年可为全球经济增加 4.4 万亿美元

麦肯锡公司称，生成性人工智能每年可为全球经济增加 “2.6 万亿至 4.4 万亿美元”。这几乎是 “相当于在地球上增加一个规模相当于英国的新国家（其 2021 年 GDP 为 3.1 万亿美元）”。这一数据比该公司在 2017 年的预估上调了 15% 至 40%。生成性人工智能和其他技术有可能使工作自动化，但麦肯锡认为这并不意味着大规模的工作流失，而是“使这些工作的执行速度大大加快”。麦肯锡发现，主要受到影响的工作任务是客户运营、市场和销售、软件工程和研发等工作。


消息来源：Venture Beat



老王点评：虽然如此说，但是一些人失业是不可避免的，就看谁能适应。可以预期的是，人工智能鸿沟会进一步拉大社会差距。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[与你最亲近的人建立一种开放的文化，并带着它走遍天下。


作为 80 年代的叛逆少年，“因为我这么说”是我在家里经常听到的一句话。我并不是一个真正的叛逆者。我只是想让别人听到我的声音，把我看成是一个开始表达自己想法和情感的人。

我那种不被倾听/聆听的感觉让我相信，培养不害怕说话的孩子很重要，但他们也能学会适应。倾听他们的意见，与孩子们合作，也可以帮助他们发挥创造力，最终让他们成为成功组织的一部分。

孩子们如何解释信息

我并没有刻意鼓励孩子们的开放行为，也没有主动告诉孩子们要大声说话。尽管如此，在我大儿子上幼儿园的第一天，他的老师给我们打电话。她告诉我们，当她和全班同学一起讨论不打架、不推搡等规则时，我的孩子举手告诉她，他的父母允许他一直争论和辩论。

这是真的。我让我的孩子们表达自己的意见，并让他们听到。但我孩子的话让我感到惊讶。直到那时我才意识到，虽然我一直在做正确的事情，但事实上，我的孩子们的行为不应该只是对我们教育他们的方式的反应。我们也不应该让他们从二手语境中挑选东西。那一天对我来说是一个游戏规则的改变，践行开放的文化正式主动地进入我们的家庭。

为成长而开放

在我小的时候，父母和长辈是有知识的人。

作为一个孩子，要获得信息并不容易。虽然我被鼓励表达意见，但也只是到了一个规范的、“容易消化”的程度。今天，父母、老师和孩子都有同样的手段来获取数据。你如何处理它，完全取决于你。

例如，在用希伯来语玩 Scattergories 时，“病毒”一词通常是大多数人玩的唯一以 “V” 开头的生物。为了获得更多的分数，我们决定寻找其他符合条件的动物名称。不一会儿，我们就找到了不是一种而是三种新的生物（我孩子的老师认为“小袋鼠”（希伯来语中以 “V” 拼写）不是一种真实的东西，但这是另一个故事）。

我教我的孩子阅读字里行间的内容，决不要不加质疑地接受作为“事实”呈现给他们的东西。这使他们能够练习批判性思维。这也使他们能够质疑我，从而使我们进行公开和透明的讨论。

这些讨论容易吗？不是。我总是有精力进行这些讨论吗？绝对不是。

然而，为了帮助他们练习学会倾听的“肌肉”，这些对话是必须的。

偶尔，我们必须强迫自己找到时间，把注意力集中在家庭上。建立一个强大而开放的文化需要时间，随着人们的变化，你的家庭文化也在变化。你必须适应并努力保持它的活力。作为群体的领导者，我必须为我的孩子们提供一个安全的地方，一个他们可以公开分享自己想法的地方，一个他们有归属感的地方。

在一个家庭中，你们必须合作，共同解决问题。倾听不同的想法和解决问题的方法可以让你想出创造性的（但并不总是符合每个人的喜好）解决方案。

我家里的一个问题是玩电脑游戏时家里的噪音。这种情况大多发生在深夜和周末。我们一起坐下来，想出了一个商定的嘈杂游戏的时间段。从那时起，那些想玩的人知道他们什么时候可以玩，而那些寻求一些安静时间的人也知道这些时间会发生什么。随着孩子们的长大，决定和讨论的性质也发生了变化。

这是否意味着所有的决定都与孩子们分享？不。这是否意味着都是玫瑰花？绝对不是。

鼓励孩子们建立联系可能会以一个破花瓶告终，似乎没有人对此负责。这可能会导致“因为我这么说”来拜访。然而，进行具有挑战性但又具有包容性的对话、鼓励创新思维以及让孩子参与决策都是让他们为成年做好准备的方法。希望它也能让他们成为更好的人（到目前为止，以我的拙见，这运作良好）。

开放的家庭文化

实行开放的文化不是一次性的事情。它是一个旅程，也是一种心态。我相信它为我和我的孩子们提供了工具，使他们在屋内和屋外都能坚韧不拔、思想开放、宽容和充满好奇心。与你最亲近的人建立一种开放的文化，并带着它走遍天下。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[在 Rust 系列的 上一篇文章 中，我介绍了如何使用 if 和 else 关键字来处理 Rust 程序的控制流。

这是处理程序控制流的一种方法。另一种方法是使用循环。因此，让我们在本文中看看循环。

Rust 中可用的循环

Rust 编程语言有三种不同的循环，基于你想要实现什么以及可用的内容：


for

while

loop


我假设你对 for 和 while 已经很熟悉了，但 loop 对你来说可能是个新概念。让我们先从熟悉的概念开始。

for 循环

for 循环主要用于迭代一种称为迭代器的东西。

这个迭代器可以从任何东西中创建，从数组、向量（很快就会介绍！）、一系列值，或者任何自定义的东西。这里的可能性是无限的。

来看看 for 循环的语法。

for 迭代变量 in 迭代器 {
    <语句>;
}


其中的 迭代变量 在大多数其他编程语言教程中通常被称为 i ; )

迭代器 可以是任何东西，只要它能告诉下一个值是什么，如果有的话。

来通过一个程序来理解这个。

fn main() {
    let my_arr = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9];

    println!("迭代数组");
    for element in my_arr {
        println!("{}", element);
    }

    println!("\n迭代一个真正的迭代器");
    for element in my_arr.iter() {
        println!("{}", element);
    }

    println!("\nPython 风格的范围");
    for element in …]]></summary>

东南亚华人华侨的历史久为学界关注，从最早的经济行为入手，继而政治意义、文化衍变传承以及身份认同等各方面都有了优秀的专著和研究文章。并且，在“南洋”这个大的地域概念之下，逐渐细分出不同国家/地区华人华侨在历史上的差异化发展沿革。比如笔者博士求学期间主要研究的新加坡/马来亚华人华侨，和工作后所在泰国的华人华侨，不论是早期华侨时代还是演变至今的华人华裔，都呈现出迥异的生存状态以及认同。李欣祥先生这本《消逝的海外华邦：西婆罗洲华人政权的兴亡》从兰芳公司（1770-1884）这个领域内都有所耳闻的“华人海外共和国”入手，对西婆罗洲曾存在过若干华人政权的缘起、发展和灭亡做了详细的介绍与分析，并试图讨论这些政权尤其是兰芳公司在整个华人历史中可能扮演过的重要且独特的先驱角色（兰芳公司的名称之争历来已久，本文采纳李欣祥先生在书中的叫法，写作兰芳公司）。由于西婆罗洲现今华人群体式微，相关的研究工作不曾大规模开展过，而李欣祥先生将他之前的累积做了一个更有深度和广度的延伸，把西婆罗洲存在过的华人公司作为整体研究对象撰写了《消逝的海外华邦》，为那段西婆罗洲华人公司及政权的历史刻下了重要的印记。
公司（kongsi）还是共和国——如何定义西婆罗洲的华人政权
作者给这本书的题目起得很巧妙，用了“华邦”这个词，因为对兰芳公司的定性几十年来一直有所争议。以荷兰学者高延为代表的一部分学者认为，兰芳公司的领袖大统制角色近乎共和政体下的总统，甚至发展出自己类似议会的议政制度，加上拥有武装力量、税收政策以及对外关系，尤其当时的清政府并没有承认和兰芳的从属关系，完全可以被视作一个独立的国家，所以兰芳公司当之无愧可以被称为“兰芳共和国”。但还有一部分学者认为，兰芳公司并没有脱离东南亚华人群体中“公司（ko…]]></summary>

at the advantages and disadvantages of how documentation for PostgreSQL
is written.


	The strengths of this process are also its weaknesses. A developer
	is, by definition, someone who spends the majority of their time
	doing development, which is to say writing code. Updating the
	documentation becomes a task that must be completed so that the
	code one has written can get committed so that one can move on to
	the next project and write some more code. If a change to the
	documentation would be beneficial but is unrelated to any
	particular patch, it's not likely to get done.

	The results are, in a certain sense, pretty comical.]]></summary>

previous day, Christian Brauner led another discussion about providing user
space with a mechanism to get current mount information on day two of the
2023 Linux Storage, Filesystem,
Memory-Management and BPF Summit.  The session also continued on from
one at last year's 
summit—and likely others before that.
There are two separate proposals for ways to retrieve this kind of
information, one from Miklos Szeredi and another from David Howells, both

We provide a Chat UI and APIs that enforce PII redaction, audit logging, and data access controls for companies that want to use LLMs with their corporate data from Google Docs, Slack, or Confluence. There’s a demo video here: https://www.loom.com/share/2b5409fd64464dc9b5b6277f2be4e90f?....
One big thing enterprises and businesses are worried about with LLMs is “what’s happening to my data”? The way we see it, there are three big security and privacy barriers companies need to solve:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[6 月 14 日消息，在 2023 开放原子全球开源峰会上，阿里云公布 1+4 开源战略，在操作系统、云原生、数据库、大数据四大开源领域之外，AI 模型社区魔搭作为大模型方向的开源新势力首次亮相。据悉，目前已有 15 款支持中文的开源大模型在魔搭社区上线。



开放原子开源基金会是我国首家开源基金会，于 2020 年 6 月在北京成立，由阿里等多家科技企业联合发起，主管单位为工信部。今年，阿里云首次将魔搭社区（ModelScope）带到开放原子全球开源峰会这一顶尖开源大会上。

去年 11 月，阿里与 CCF 开源发展委员会联手推出魔搭社区，初衷就是通过开源开放、共建社区生态的方式，让 AI 开发使用更简单。魔搭社区践行模型即服务（Model as a Service）（MaaS）新理念，提供多类优质 AI 模型以及模型调优、训练、部署等一体化服务，旨在降低AI模型应用门槛。

经过半年左右的发展，魔搭已经成为国内规模最大、最活跃的 AI 模型开源社区，开发者数量超 160 万，模型下载量超 2500 万，累计开源开放了 900 多个优质 AI 模型，包括阿里通义大模型系列、澜舟科技的孟子模型、智谱 AI 的中英双语千亿大模型等 15 款支持中文的开源大模型。魔搭社区现已成为中国 AI 模型开源第一门户。未来，魔搭社区将继续帮助开发者将 AI 模型转化为生产力，持续推动 AI 领域的开源生态建设。



阿里云是开源的受益者，也是积极贡献者。在操作系统领域，阿里云、统信软件等联合发起的龙蜥社区已成为国内领先的操作系统开源社区。在云原生领域，阿里云的开源项目覆盖容器调度、微服务、分布式应用治理等多个重要领域。在数据库领域，阿里云核心产品 PolarDB 数据库 PostgreSQL 版和分布式版已经开源。在大数据领域，Flink 是当下被广泛使用的开源大数据计算引擎之一。

三年来，阿里云一直积极参与开放原子开源基金会建设，积极向基金会捐赠开源项目。龙蜥操作系统在 2021 年 10 月进入基金会孵化流程；阿里云倡议发起云原生工作委员会后，双方就 ACK Distro 和云原生应用脚手架两个开源项目达成捐赠意向。此外，阿里云还深度参与建设了 AtomGit 代码协作平台。

开放原子开源基金会副理事长、阿里云市场总裁刘湘雯在会上表示，未来阿里云将持续拥抱开源生态，持续投入 AI、云原生、数据库、大数据、操作系统等领域的开源工作，持续提升开发者服务和企业创新支持，为开源创新提速。]]></summary>

上周伊朗军方展示了其海军大学开发的“量子处理算法”的首款产品，它能帮助军方探测水面的扰动。但通过媒体公布的“量子”设备图像的分析显示，该设备可能是一款在亚马逊上出售的 FPGA 开发板 ZedBoard，在图像上甚至可以清晰地看到该品牌名。ZedBoard 开发板主要是用于视频处理、可重构计算、电机控制、软件加速等用途，并不具有“量子比特”。

老王点评：有没有一种可能，他们就是在这样的板卡上安装了几个“量子比特”？🤣




人工智能对人工智能生成的内容进行训练将导致人工智能崩溃

用于训练大型语言模型的数据最初来自人类来源，如书籍、文章、照片等，这些都是在没有人工智能的帮助下创建的。但随着越来越多的人使用人工智能来制作和发布内容，一个明显的问题出现了：当人工智能生成的内容在互联网上扩散时，人工智能模型开始对其进行训练。研究人员发现，“在训练中使用模型生成的内容会导致所产生的模型出现不可逆转的缺陷。”他们研究了文本到文本和图像到图像的人工智能生成模型的概率分布，得出结论：“从其他模型产生的数据中学习会导致模型崩溃 —— 这是一个退化的过程，并且随着时间的推移，模型会忘记真正的基础数据分布。”他们观察到模型崩溃发生得如此之快：模型可以迅速忘记它们最初学习的大部分原始数据。这导致它们随着时间的推移，表现越来越差，错误越来越多。


消息来源：Venture Beat



老王点评：这让我想起了衔尾蛇，一种自己吞噬自己尾巴的蛇。这样下来人工智能失去对世界的真正认知，我们的未来或许再也分不清现实和人工智能虚构的“现实”。




Meta 开源了音乐和图像模型

Meta 公司开源发布了自己的人工智能音乐生成器 MusicGen。它可以将文字描述（例如 “一首 80 年代的流行歌曲，背景音效是重鼓声和合成器垫音效”）变成大约 12 秒的音频。该公司没有提供用于训练模型的代码，但它提供了预训练的模型，任何拥有合适硬件的人，如 16GB 的 GPU 都可以运行。

Meta 也发布了一个 “类似人类” 的人工智能图像创作模型 I-JEPA，训练代码和模型快照发布在 GitHub 上。Meta 称，该模型利用相关世界的背景知识来填补图像的缺失部分，而不是像其他生成性人工智能模型那样只看附近的像素。它使用了类似人类的推理，可以避免人工智能生成的图像中常见的错误，如多了手指的手。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[在安装完 Debian 12 “Bookworm”要做的一些事情。


我想你已经安装好了 Debian 12 “Bookworm” 或者 准备升级 了。Debian 12 经过一年多的开发，于 2023 年 6 月 10 日发布。它带来了最新的软件包、升级和替换一些关键模块。请在此查看 Debian 12 的一些新特性 指南。

如果你在笔记本电脑或台式机上使用 Debian，那么在安装或升级到 Debian 12 后，以下是你可能需要完成的一些步骤。

Debian 12 安装后需要做的几件事情

启用 sudo

如果你将 Debian 12 作为新安装的系统，那么你的用户账户可能没有超级用户访问权限。出于安全原因，Debian 在安装期间不允许任何选项给予用户账户 sudo 访问权限。以下是如何将用户添加到超级用户组。

打开终端并使用 root 密码进入 root 账户。

su


然后运行以下命令，将你的用户账户添加到 sudo 组。请将下面的用户名更改为你的账户。

/sbin/addgroup 用户名 sudo


现在，你可以注销并再次登录该账户。

确保 Debian 已更新至最新版本

在开始工作或进行任何配置之前，确保 Debian 12 已更新至最新版本非常重要。从终端中按以下顺序运行以下命令以刷新 Debian 系统。

sudo apt update
sudo apt upgrade


Debian 12 中的非自由软件

Debian 12 中有一个关于管理“非自由”固件包的根本变化。Debian 创建了一个新的软件源，以便轻松访问那些专有包。因此，如果你想添加非自由软件包，需要确保在 APT 软件源文件 /etc/apt/sources.list 中添加以下行：

sudo nano /etc/…]]></summary>

嗅探，嗅探，那是什么？ 🤔

这是我在系统上看到的可疑网络连接吗？ 🚨❌

你可能想知道我如何查看系统上的网络活动。 嗯，当然，一些 系统监控工具 应该有所帮助。但是，如果我想要更多详细信息怎么办？

好吧，我遇到了一个不错的工具 Sniffnet。 它是一个用于实时监控网络活动的简洁的开源应用，也是专有的 GlassWire（如 Portmaster）的一个很好的替代品。

那么，让我们深入挖掘吧！

Sniffnet：概述 ⭐



Sniffnet 是一个基于 Rust 的网络监控工具，可让你跟踪通过系统的所有互联网流量。 它提供了一些非常有用的功能，高级用户肯定会喜欢这些功能**。

当你第一次启动 Sniffnet 时，你会看到一个菜单来选择网络适配器、过滤器和应用协议。

完成选择后，单击“火箭”按钮开始。



这是概览页的样子。它显示了所有当前的网络连接，以及一个方便的流量图，供你分析流量。


📋 你可以选择将数据显示为字节或单个数据包。




要更深入地查看你的网络连接，你可以前往“检查Inspect”选项卡。

在这里，你将看到一个包含所有重要信息的列表，例如 IP 地址、数据包数量、数据量、来源国家等等。

你可以单击各个连接获得更详细的情况。



如果你想为更具体的目的过滤结果怎么办？

好吧，那么你可以使用“检查”选项卡下的过滤器选项根据你的需要过滤结果。

你可以通过以下方式过滤列表： 应用、国家、域名等。

这是它的样子：



Sniffnet 还可以向你显示可以以文本格式导出的连接的详细报告。

只需单击右下角带有页面/向右箭头的徽标即可开始。



可定制性如何？

好吧，Sniffnet 有一组不错的设置供你调整。

第一个是“通知”选项卡，它允许你根据可以设置的各种阈值来设置通知的行为。



然后是可以通过“样式Style”选项卡访问的主题。它提供四种选择，雪人之夜是我的最爱。



最后，“语言Language”选项卡允许你设置你选择的界面语言。



好了，就此结束。

Sniffnet 是一个方便的工具，可以非常详细地了解系统上的网络活动。

你可以使用它来监控你的网络。

此外，与另一个网络监控工具 Nutty 相比，在我看来，Sniffnet 的使用和设置要直观得多。

📥 获取 Sniffnet

Sniffnet 可跨多个平台使用，包括 Linux、Windows 和 macOS。 你可以前往官方网站获取你选择的安装包。


Sniffnet


如果愿意，你还可以在 GitHub 上仔细查看其源代码。

2023年春，《有凤来仪——夏含夷教授七十华诞祝寿论文集》由中西书局正式出版。夏含夷（Edward L. Shaughnessy）是芝加哥大学教授、《剑桥中国上古史》主编。正好夏先生来北京，我专程赴京，4月20日上午、21日晚上分两次对夏先生做了访谈。

《有凤来仪：夏含夷教授七十华诞祝寿论文集》，朱渊清  苏荣誉主编，中西书局2022年12月出版，270.00元

朱渊清：夏先生，这次给您带来了七十岁祝寿的论文集《有凤来仪》，终于出版了。
夏含夷：太好了，非常感谢你。要请你和各位作者给这本书签名。
朱渊清：三十一位中国学者的论文，前些日子已经寄给您电子档，您满意吗？
夏含夷：很满意。我还没有读完。涉及内容实在是太丰富了。
朱渊清：您一辈子从事中国古史研究，取得了巨大的成就，很希望请您谈谈自己的学术经历。
夏含夷：没问题。
朱渊清：您是什么时候如何开始学习中文的，又是如何走上中国古史的研究之路的？
夏含夷：1968年我读高中时正在打越战。1970年我进大学，读的是圣母大学。这是听从了我父亲的建议，不然的话可能就要去当兵。我对思想史有兴趣，大学一年级时遇到两个四年级的朋友，跟着他们听了几门神学课，对中国的道教、禅宗很感兴趣。1972年三年级时，学校终于开了门中文课，老师是香港来的。这是我学中文之始。三年级结束我去参加明德大学暑期班，专门补习中文。明德大学暑期班学习外语特别好，学校周围的风景也很漂亮。
朱渊清：我知道。您的大女儿也在明德大学读过书，学中文。
夏含夷：对。在明德大学暑期班学习外语必须先签一个保证书，保证整个夏天不说英语。老师和学生学习、生活在一起，必须时时讲中文。非常累。
朱渊清：除了中文语言，您对中国文化的兴趣最初是在道教、禅宗。
夏含夷：圣母大学神学系还聘了一个大学者，是芝加哥大学毕业的，我…]]></summary>

《真理与生命》杂志1929年和1930年两期，刊登了李荣芳撰写的两篇《圣地游行记》。《真理与生命》是民国期间极具影响力的基督教刊物，主编为赵紫宸，编辑部成员与“撰述员”基本来自燕京大学宗教学院。这两篇游记，记述了李荣芳于1929年3月到5月在巴勒斯坦地区的两次出游，一次是乘车，“专到紧要的区域”，一次是骑马，“专到闭塞的地方”。
李荣芳（1887-1965）是燕京大学宗教学院教授。相比于吴雷川、赵紫宸这些中国基督教界的名人，他在生前和身后都不是一个响亮的名字。但他有一个独特的背景，是其他民国基督教知识分子所不具备的。李荣芳是在美国受过科班训练的圣经学学者，而不是单纯研究神学的理论家。他于1908年进入汇文大学神科，获得学士和硕士学位。1913年，他进入位于美国新泽西州的德鲁神学院（Drew Theological Seminary，当时译为“芝儒神学院”），大约在1917或1918年获得神学博士。从他的博士导师、博士论文选题、回国后开设的课程、翻译的英文著作以及他自己所撰写的报刊文章，我们可以看到他是一位严谨的圣经学者，而不是泛谈神学义理的神学家。
李荣芳1917年归国，先在自己的母校汇文大学任教。1919年燕京大学成立，汇文大学就是组成燕大的四所教会大学之一，所以李荣芳也就成为燕京大学神学院教授（后改为“宗教学院”）。创校之初，教员中只有两位中国教师，李荣芳便是其中一位，主要教授圣经希伯来文和旧约。根据1931年燕京大学宗教学院的课程大纲，李荣芳开设多门与旧约有关的专业课。在“旧约训诂”的课程类别中，他开设《前代希伯来先知》《后代希伯来先知》《旧约诗文》，在“旧约历史与教义”的课程类别中，开设《以色列民族史》《闪族之宗教》《先知的社会理想》等课。在语言课程中，则教授《希伯来文初阶》《希伯来文训诂》。放眼当时的学术界，能教授古代…]]></summary>

在各个群晖用户论坛里，有用户反馈使用 WDDA 监控和测试子系统的西数硬盘一旦开机时间达到三年，就会在群晖 DSM 上出现 “警告” 标记。WDDA 类似于希捷等硬盘采用的 SMART 技术。WDDA 给出的警告说：“在硬盘的整个寿命中，该硬盘已经积累了大量的开机时间。请考虑尽快更换该硬盘”。但除此之外，硬盘似乎没有明显的问题。群晖称，该警告信息来自于西数而不是群晖。这导致大量用户恐慌，并认为这是“西数试图销售更多硬盘的掠夺性策略”。受 WDDA 影响的一些产品包括 WD Red Pro、WD Red Plus 和 WD Purple。


消息来源：Ars Technica



老王点评：这种强制老化硬盘而不是根据硬盘实际状态给出警告的做法，让用户无法再信任它的产品，只能把用户逼到其它厂商那里。顺便说一句，网上有一个帖子讨论了如何禁止该警告——但可悲是，这个 Reddit 帖子所在子区在抗议活动中暂时不能访问。




英特尔演示新的芯片背面供电技术

英特尔计划在明年推出名为 RibbonFET 的新晶体管技术，以及新的供电方法 PowerVia。PowerVia 是英特尔版本的背面供电技术。今天的芯片是在正面将晶体管与供电和数据传输互连在一起，而背面供电将所有供电互连转移到芯片背面。这会产生两个影响，其一是为正面的数据互连留出了更多空间，其二是供电互连可以更大因此电阻更小。英特尔测试了由当前一代的晶体管和 PowerVia 组合的处理器内核，显示内核频率提升逾 6%，设计更紧凑，功耗降低 30%。过去几代的英特尔芯片在功耗效率上都落后于竞争对手，如 AMD 使用台积电 7 纳米和 5 纳米工艺制造的芯片。


消息来源：Solidot



老王点评：虽然经常说芯片技术要达到极限了，但是我们看到的是总是有各种突破和改进，所以我预期芯片技术还会继续以摩尔定律向前发展。




Edge 会将你在线观看的图片发送到微软

Edge 有一个内置的图像增强工具，可以使用 “超级分辨率来改善网络上图像的清晰度、锐度、照明和对比度”。虽然该功能听起来很令人兴奋，但最近的微软 Edge Canary 更新表明，它会将图像链接发送到微软，而不是在本地设备上执行增强。这个功能虽然可以关闭，但是它是默认启用的。之前，用户还发现 Edge 会将你的浏览器历史记录泄露给 Bing。


消息来源：NeoWin



老王点评：微软的骚操作挺多啊，虽然 Edge 需要更多丰富的功能来胜过 Chrome，但似乎用力过猛了。]]></summary>

苏享茂从认识女方到离婚百余天被索要千万后自杀一事，终于再次有了关键性进展。


虽然并未看到关于批捕的任何法律文书，但据相关知情人向中新社国是直通车透露，翟欣欣在本周被批准逮捕。


婚恋网站上遇到“致命爱人”！


梳理事件经过：2017年9月7日凌晨5时许，时年37岁的WePhone创始人兼开发者苏享茂从北京市某地跳楼，被发现时已无生命体征。坠楼发生之前，苏享茂在WePhone产品上推送了一条“公司法人被毒妻翟某害死，WePhone即将停止运营”的消息。两人于同年6月7日结婚、7月18日离婚。


苏享茂遗书内容显示，他与翟欣欣于婚恋网站相识，结婚前为翟欣欣花了几百万，领证前一天才被告知曾有短暂婚史，翟欣欣还通过诉讼从前夫处获得20万元分手费。苏翟俩人商议离婚后，翟欣欣以家中有官员亲戚及举报苏享茂偷漏税相要挟索要1000万元分手费及海南300万元房产。


此后，死者哥哥苏享龙发文爆出大量疑似苏享茂与翟欣欣以及翟欣欣与他人聊天记录，直指翟欣欣为了“弄钱”才与苏享茂结婚，其中还有与他人谈价约见的内容。诉翟欣欣的民事案件于2020年12月21日在北京市朝阳区人民法院开庭审理。


时隔两年多之后，该案于2023年3月31日在北京市朝阳区人民法院宣判，一审判决翟欣欣退还苏享茂家属现金、汽车共近千万以及撤销翟欣欣海南、北京两套房产的个人所有权，翟欣欣提起上诉。


民事案件尚未落定，翟欣欣便以“敲诈勒索罪”被刑事立案侦查并批捕。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[以下是如何从 Debian 11 升级到 Debian 12 “Bookworm” 的步骤。


Debian 12 Bookworm 已经发布。如果你正在运行 Debian 11 “Bullseye”，你可以计划现在升级你的台式机或服务器。但是，建议你等待 Debian “Bookworm” 的第一个小版本，即 12.1 版本，再进行关键服务器升级。

话虽如此，如果你想了解 Debian 12 的新特性，可以查看 这篇文章。以下是详细的升级步骤：

从 Debian 11 升级到 Debian 12

无论你运行的是 Debian 服务器还是任何桌面版本，请确保备份关键数据。例如，你可能需要为桌面文档进行备份。如果是服务器，请记录正在运行的服务。你可以使用 rsync 或其他实用工具来完成此操作。

Debian 12 引入了一个名为 non-free-firmware 的新仓库，用于专有驱动程序和软件包。如果你使用任何“闭源”的网络、显示、图形或其他驱动程序，你可能需要在升级后进行配置。

对于网络驱动程序，请确保在某个地方安全地记录 /etc/network/interfaces 和 /etc/resolv.conf 文件的内容。如果在升级完成后失去了网络连接，可以 按照这个指南 轻松设置它。

从命令提示符运行以下命令，以确保 Debian 11 更新了安全和其他软件包：

sudo apt update
sudo apt upgrade
sudo apt full-upgrade
sudo apt autoremove


完成上述命令后，重新启动 Debian 11 系统：

sudo systemctl reboot

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Debian 的下一个重要版本已经发布。




虽然没有固定的时间表，但每隔约两年 Debian 就会推出一个新的稳定版升级。

Debian 11 发布于 2021 年，现在是 2023 年，我们迎来了下一个主要版本 Debian 12。

要注意的是，正如发布说明中所提到的，Debian 12 发布时已知存在约 100 个错误。因此，在升级或安装之前，你可能需要详细阅读此版本的发布说明。


💡 如果你不知道，每个 Debian 的稳定版本都可以得到 至少三年的活动维护和支持，此外，它也提供了 两年的扩展 LTS 支持作为商业服务。直到 2028 年 6 月，Debian 12 都将得到支持。你有一年的时间从 Debian 11 升级。


Debian 12 有哪些新功能？

对于重大版本升级，肯定会更新一些软件包，而过时或老旧的软件会被删除。

与我们在 Debian 12 功能列表 中提到的类似，包括了以下增强功能：


更新的安装程序

Linux 内核 6.1

默认启用 PipeWire 音频系统

全新壁纸


安装程序升级



每个发行版都致力于改进新用户的安装体验，而 Debian 也不例外。

Debian 12 可以更好地处理非自由固件，这是可以提高新用户的入门体验的亮点之一。

此外，还有许多底层改进，包括硬件兼容性升级。

Linux 内核 6.1



Debian 12 带有 LTS 版本的 Linux 内核 6.1。

该内核包含 Rust 的实验性支持、AMD 硬件优化和改进的 ARM 支持。

桌面环境和软件升级

Debian 12 默认预装了 GNOME 43、KDE Plasma 5.27、LXDE 11、LXQt 1.2.0、MATE 1.26 和 XFCE 4.18。新的桌面环境版本应该会提升桌面体验，还有必要的应用程序更新，包括：


GIMP 2.10.34

Perl 5.36

Vim 9.0

OpenJDK 17




不要忘了还有一张新的 壁纸，为所有那些神奇的软件更新增添了装饰。

其他变化



如果你需要了解完整的技术细节和升级信息，可以查看 发行说明 或 官方公告。这里列出了一些重要的更新亮点：


默认启用 PipeWire 音频服务器

基于 Go 的软件包支持限制安全

删除了超过 9,519 个过时/陈旧的软件包

Debian 12 现在可以检测到双引导系统中的 Windows 11。

已经重新引入了 ARM64 上的 Secure Boot 支持。



下载 Debian 12


Debian 12 是一个不错的升级版本，但请注意 某些问题。你已经升级了吗？请让我知道你的想法。

The main goal of zsync is to foster high quality content and discussion. That's it. If it can't accomplish that, then to me it is a failure. I watched Reddit go from having high quality discussion in 2008-9 to devolving into the PC meme dumpster it is today [1]. HN still has the highest discussion quality of any "forum" I know of, but (1) it can sometimes randomly be very hostile/toxic to new tech, the most glaring example being crypto. (2) HN is basically a single subreddit mostly geared towards tech and startups. It'd be nice to have an equivalent of "subreddits"

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Heya HN, I've been working on a reddit-like platform as my primary side project for the last few years. Doing a (very) soft launch today, mainly because I want to use it to encourage discussion of alternatives.
How non.io works:
1. Free to browse, paid to interact.
2. Minimum subscription is $2 (though you can choose more). I take $1 to run the servers, everything left gets split evenly between everything you upvote that month.
It's a simple model, but I hope it's a better one than the freemium model we've been relying on for the last few years. Fundamentally I feel like any ad-supported network doesn't have alignment between the needs of the users and the needs of the platform, which is what drove me to make this.
Because this is a soft launch, if you do subscribe I'd encourage you not to pay for the time being. I'm still testing the distribution algorithm for returning funds - you won't get overcharged or anything, but I just want to guarantee your funds are properly distributed at the end of the month. I've opened up free accounts to post and interact in the meantime. If you want to try a test account, use this login:
login: hackernews pw: helloworld
Edit: Loginless browsing here: https://non.io/#all

Here’s a general platform demo video if you’re interested: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZD-pyKGwR4
Feature flagging is a technique that lets developers switch features on or off in a software application without redeploying it, enhancing testing and rollback capabilities. At their core, feature flagging platforms solve the problem of separating production code deploys from feature releases to users. While DevCycle solves that same general pain, we also aim to solve core problems in developer experience and …]]></summary>

the strongest claim to the CPU.  There are many factors that complicate
that job, not the least of which is that the "strongest claim" is sometimes
a bit of a fuzzy concept.  Realtime throttling, a mechanism designed to
keep a runaway realtime task from monopolizing the CPU, is one case where
developers have concluded that the task with, ostensibly, the highest
priority should not actually be the one that runs.  But realtime throttling
has rarely pleased anybody; the deadline-server
infrastructure patches posted by Daniel Bristot de Oliveira are the
latest attempt to find a better solution.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[超过 80% 的 Reddit 子区关闭

此前，我们 报道 过，Reddit 为 API 访问设定了远超合理的价格，事实上扼杀了第三方客户端，招致社区的强烈抗议，子区管理员们定于 12 日临时或永久关闭子区以抗议。现在，Reddit 社区开始计划中的大规模抗议。截止发文，Reddit 共有逾 7,266 个子区（版块），目前已有 6,292 个已经关闭了对外访问，从公开变成私有，其中包括订阅数超过四千万的 r/funny，订阅数超三千万的 r/aww、r/gaming、r/Music 等等，订阅人数合计超过 26 亿。Reddit CEO 上周五举办的问答讨论没有解决任何问题，反而更进一步激怒了 Reddit 社区，一些原计划关闭 48 小时的子区也决定无限期关闭。抗议者们还制作了 专门的网站 来统计已经关的子区，非常壮观的列表。

老王点评：这下好了，都关闭了，Reddit 就省钱了。




Debian 12 “Bookworm” 正式发布

在将近 2 年的开发之后，代号为 “Bookworm” 的 Debian 12 正式发布，它将得到 5 年的支持。Debian 12 使用的桌面环境包括：GNOME 43、KDE Plasma 5.27、LXDE 11 等。该版本的软件包总数达到 64,419，包含 11,089 个新的软件包，移除了 6,296 个过时的软件包，更新了 43,254 个软件包，总占用磁盘空间 365 GB，总代码行数达 13 亿行。

老王点评：无论如何，Debian 仍然是最重要的 Linux 发行版之一，也是诸多发行版的根源。




西方更担心中国获得 AI 主导地位

风险投资家 Marc Andreessen 撰文批评了 “AI 末日论者”，称人工智能 “并不想杀死你，因为它不是活的……人工智能是一台机器 —— 它不会像你的烤面包机那样活过来。”他认为，科技公司之所以倡导建立监管壁垒，形成一个由政府保护的人工智能供应商组成的企业联盟，免受新的创业公司和开源竞争的影响，是这样他们就可以赚更多钱。另外他指出，不以最大力度和速度追求人工智能的实际风险就是中国，中国正在快速发展人工智能。为了阻止中国人工智能影响力的扩散，他认为，“美国和西方国家应该尽可能地靠拢人工智能”。

老王点评：人工智能这个魔盒打开后，基于博弈论的考虑，是无法关上的。]]></summary>

无论是智能手机、桌面电脑还是物联网设备，开源软件在某种形式上无处不在。

虽然安卓是一个开源项目，但你可以在上面找到专有和开源的应用程序。除了你可能已经使用的流行专有安卓应用程序，开源安卓应用程序可以作为更好的替代品，它尊重你的隐私。

在这里，我为你精选了最好的开源安卓应用程序，可以作为日常使用的应用。

希望这个列表对你分享给他人时有所帮助！


📋 列出的开源应用程序可以在谷歌 Play 商店、F-Droid 商店或开发者的官方网站/平台上找到。你应始终使用官方推荐源来下载和安装 APK。


键盘应用



当你发送短信或搜索信息时，键盘应用程序是你最常接触的应用程序。

当然，像 SwiftKey 这样的应用也许在以前还不错，但现在它们已经稍显普通了。此外，选择一个尊重你的隐私、符合预期（没有任何花哨的功能）的开源键盘应用程序才是明智的选择。一些最佳选项包括：

1、Simple Keyboard

如其名称所示，Simple Keyboard 是一个 极简的选项，适合想要没有花哨功能的简单键盘应用程序的用户。它是谷歌默认键盘应用程序 Gboard 的出色替代品。

但如果你想要主题自定义和一些额外的控件，它可能会让你失望。


📥 GitHub



📥 F-Droid



📥 Play 商店


2、AnySoftKeyboard

AnySoftKeyboard 是我的最爱，它拥有我需要的所有基本功能，包括 主题自定义、快速文本和手势支持。

如果你想要一个简单的键盘体验，它可以很简单；如果你要求更多的功能，它也可以是一个合适工具。

詹姆斯·鲍斯威尔（James Boswell）1740年生于苏格兰的爱丁堡，其父是贵族兼大法官，原本希望子承父业，但鲍斯威尔醉心于伦敦的游乐，尤好结交名士。1763年他和约翰生在伦敦初次相见，两人逐渐克服了年龄、家庭背景、性格爱好等方面的差异，成为忘年至交。他的《约翰生传》常常被誉为“现代欧洲传记的鼻祖”。
这本传记涵盖了约翰生的一生，包含大量的轶事和人物对话。鲍斯威尔自豪地说，“在这部作品中，约翰生的形象将比其他任何留在人们记忆中的，都更完整、更清晰”。传统传记刻意追求伦理意义，如中世纪的圣徒传记，往往将传主理想化、圣洁化。而鲍斯威尔开创的现代传记，其特点就是真实地再现传主的人生及其所处的时代。约翰生曾教导鲍斯威尔，传记作家的责任就是“展示日常生活中的微小细节”，不要回避传主的缺点。这本传记记录了约翰生的许多怪癖，但更突显了约翰生狂放孤傲的秉性、独立的人格以及率真的性情。二十多年来，鲍斯威尔孜孜不倦地记下有关约翰生的言谈，这本传记并非仅仅“记事”，更是大量地“记言”。《约翰生传》不乏戏剧性，转述大段的对话时，灵活自如地照顾到各位发言者的独特性格和语气，读者屡屡有亲临历史现场之感。 
值得一提的是，《约翰生传》提供了大量的历史材料，将十八世纪中后期的英国社会浓缩在其中，如果我们对当时的社会、文化背景不甚了了，恐怕很难体会鲍斯威尔的匠心。中国读者得感谢《约翰生传》的译者蒲隆先生。这个中文全译本的准确、流畅且不说，大量的注释，尤其是人物“小传”，更是读者必不可少的“辅助材料”。蒲先生翻译《约翰生传》，主要依据“人人文库”和企鹅出版社的版本（详情可以参见2023年3月24日的《上海书评》）。企鹅经典版由大卫·沃默斯利（David Womersley）编辑，拉丁语、希腊…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[不太会讲笑话的 ChatGPT

研究人员发现 ChatGPT 对笑话的了解是相当有限的：在一次测试中，输出的 1008 个笑话中有 90% 是相同的 25 个笑话。其中说了 140 次的笑话是：“为什么稻草人会获奖？因为他在自己的领域里表现突出。（双关语：站在田地里）”当被要求解释 25 个最常见的笑话中的每一个时，ChatGPT 大多提供了有效的解释，表明它 “理解” 文字游戏和双关语等风格。有趣的是，ChatGPT 喜欢拿番茄开玩笑。


消息来源：Ars Technica



老王点评：看来人工智能在这么高级的理解上还有所欠缺。不过，即便真的人工智能懂得讲各种笑话之后，距离它“拥有”情感，估计也有很漫长的距离。




英特尔开源 One Mono 编程字体

英特尔公布了 One Mono 字体，这是一种迎合 “开发者需求” 的新字体，采用 “富有表现力” 的等宽字体，以提高清晰度和可读性。它更容易阅读，而且可以免费使用，采用了开源的字体许可证。它不仅可以免费下载和使用，还可以免费编辑，并免费重新发布。


消息来源：GitHub



老王点评：嗯，又一个开源的编程字体，虽然有一些好评，但是似乎这些编程字体都差不多，那为什么大家要不断发布自己的开源字体呢？




自动驾驶的 Waymo 汽车在路上撞死了狗

报告称 Waymo 的一辆汽车在旧金山碾压了一只狗。这起事件是 Waymo 首次报告的死亡事件。从街景链接来看，这条路看起来像一个繁忙的工业区，有许多仓库、卡车送货区和铁丝网围栏。一只小狗跑到 Waymo 自动汽车前面的街道上。Waymo 自动汽车随后与该狗发生了接触，该狗没有生还。撞击发生时，Waymo 自动汽车的 4 级自动驾驶系统处于自主模式，并且有一名测试司机在场（在司机座位上）。Waymo 发表声明称，“系统正确识别了从停放的车辆后面跑出来的狗，但未能避免接触。”


消息来源：Ars Technica



老王点评：虽然这看起来是不可避免的，但是我一直觉得法律责任和保险责任是自动驾驶真正成熟的前提，甚至不是技术。]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[如果你和我一样，在 20 世纪七八十年代使用计算机长大，你可能学过一种常见的个人计算机编程语言，名为 BASIC（全称是 “初学者的通用符号指令代码Beginner's All-purpose Symbolic Instruction Code”）。那个时期，包括 TRS-80、Apple II 和 IBM PC 在内的每台个人计算机都可以找到 BASIC 实现。当时，我是一个自学的 BASIC 程序员，在尝试了 Apple II 上的 AppleSoft BASIC 后，转向 IBM PC 上的 GW-BASIC，后来在 DOS 上学习了 QuickBASIC。


我通过编写一个示例程序来探索 BASIC 和 FORTRAN 77 中的 FOR 循环，以将数字列表从 1 加到 10。


但是曾经，一种在科学编程领域受欢迎的语言是 FORTRAN（即 “公式翻译FORmula TRANslation”）。尽管在 1990 年对该语言进行的规范以后，该名称更常见的风格是 “Fortran”。

当我在 1990 年代初作为大学本科物理学生学习物理学时，我利用自己在 BASIC 上的经验学习了 FORTRAN 77。那时我意识到 BASIC 许多概念都来源于 FORTRAN。当然，FORTRAN 和 BASIC 在很多其他方面也存在差异，但我发现了解一点 BASIC 可以帮助我快速学习 FORTRAN 编程。

我想通过使用两种语言编写相同的程序，展示它们之间的一些相似之处。通过编写一个示例程序来探索 BASIC 和 FORTRAN 77 中的 FOR 循环，这个程序将把 1 到 10 之间的数字相加。

BASIC 存在许多种不同的版本，这取决于你的计算机，但该语言总体保持不变。我喜欢的一种 BASIC 版本是 Bywater…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[在 上一篇文章 中，你学习了函数。在这篇文章中，我们将学习使用条件语句来管理 Rust 程序的控制流。

什么是条件语句？

在编写代码的时候，最常见的任务之一就是检查某些条件是否为 true 或 false。“如果温度高于 35°C，打开空调。”

通过使用 if 和 else 这样的关键字（有时候结合使用），程序员可以根据条件（例如提供的参数数量、从命令行传递的选项、文件名、错误发生等）改变程序的行为。

所以，对一个程序员来说，了解任何语言的控制流都是至关重要的，更不用说 Rust 了。

条件运算符

下表列出了所有常用的单个条件运算符：




运算符
示例
解释




>
a > b
a 大于 b


<
a < b
a 小于 b


==
a == b
a 等于 b


!=
a != b
a 不等于 b


>=
a >= b
a 大于 或 等于 b


<=
a <= b
a 小于 或 等于 b



以及下表是逻辑运算符，它们用于一个或多个条件之间：




运算符
示例
解释




|| （逻辑或）
条件1 || 条件2
条件1 或 条件2 中至少有一个为 true


&& （逻辑与）
条件1 && 条件2
所有 条件都为 true


! （逻辑非）
!条件
条件 的布尔值的相反值




📋 与数学相似，你可以使用圆括号来指定操作的优先级。


使用 if else

要控制 Rust 代码的基本流程，使用两个关键字：if 和 else。这可以根据提供的条件的状态创建两个“执行路径”。

一个简单的带有替代执行路径的 if 块的语法如下：

if 条件 {
    <语句>;

耶鲁大学历史系教授杰伊·温特（Jay Winter）是第一次世界大战史研究的领军人物。他召集七十多名历史学家组成的国际团队共同编写《剑桥第一次世界大战史》，以跨国史视角和研究方法来叙述这场现代社会的浩劫，呈现了大量一手资料和最新研究成果。杰伊·温特的个人著作主要有《记忆之地，哀悼之所：欧洲文化史中的第一次世界大战》（Sites of Memory, Sites of Mourning: The Great War in European Cultural History, 1995）、《勿忘战争》（Remembering War, 2006）和《和平与自由的梦想》（Dreams of Peace and Freedom, 2006）等。以《中国与大战》《一战中的华工》等研究享誉国际的香港大学历史系教授徐国琦是《剑桥第一次世界大战史》编写团队中唯一的中国学者。他近年来提倡并身体力行“共有的历史”研究方法，跳出民族国家视野的学术范畴，着眼于跨国史及不同文明之间的交流，著有《中国人与美国人：一部共有的历史》《亚洲与一战：一部共有的历史》《奥林匹克之梦：中国与体育，1895-2008》等。
在《剑桥第一次世界大战史》中文版出版之际，《上海书评》邀请徐国琦教授与杰伊·温特教授进行了一次线上对谈，他们就历史写作中的跨国史视野，以及一战史研究近十年的新议题与新动向交换了想法。

《剑桥第一次世界大战史》（三卷），【美】杰伊·温特主编，姚百慧等译，浙江大学出版社2023年3月出版，238.00元

徐国琦：首先祝贺您主编的《剑桥第一次世界大战史》中文版面世。如果我没记错的话，法文版是十年前的2013年出版的，所以这是十周年纪念了。
杰伊·温特：这的确是第一次世界大战史研究中的特殊时刻。如你所知，这部书是一项集体成就，我们也都知道这并不太常见。在我们的职业领…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In the flatpak vs snap discussions, one thing that is rarely brought up is the actual strength of the sandboxes they use. Snap uses AppArmor for confinement (meaning that non-AppArmor distros, like Fedora, have weak confinement). Meanwhile, flatpak uses bubblewrap.
 And assume best possible conditions. Snap is running on Ubuntu where confinement is strongest, apps do not have access to X11, and does not have access to home folder.
 I haven't been able to find any serious in-depth testing on this topic comparing the two directly.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[谷歌 Bard 现在可以自己编写代码来回答问题

谷歌表示 Bard 在逻辑和推理方面越来越好。谷歌说，现在当你问 Bard 一个计算任务，如数学或字符串操作，Bard 不像其它大语言模型一样显示语言模型的输出，而是会写一个程序，并执行该程序，然后向用户显示该程序的输出作为答案。谷歌举例说，对于“请为我逆转 Lollipop 这个单词”的问题，ChatGPT 会通过语言模型给出答案 “pillopoL”，这个答案是错误的。而 Bard 会显示正确的结果，并给出计算的 Python 代码。当然，谷歌警告说，Bard 可能会对你的问题解释错误从而犯错；也有可能编写了错误的程序，就像人类编写程序一样，往往第一遍是带有错误的。


消息来源：谷歌



老王点评：这就太像人类了，居然会自己编程、自己运行。




GitHub Copilot 是一种“巧妙的软件盗版方法”

GitHub Copilot 是根据 OpenAI 的 Codex 模型建立的代码建议工具，由微软的 GitHub 进行商业化。Copilot 因其无视版权和许可证直接输出开发者公开发布的开源代码而被起诉。微软、GitHub 和 OpenAI 试图驳回此案，但只设法甩掉了一些索赔，法官保留了主要的版权和许可问题待审。2022 年 7 月，为了回应公众对 Copilot 的批评，GitHub 推出了一个用户可调整的 Copilot 过滤器，以将代码建议及其周围约 150 个字符的代码与 GitHub 上的公共代码进行检查。如果有匹配或接近匹配，该代码建议将不会显示给你。但 Copilot 优化了 AI 输出的温度设置，以尽可能多地产生许可内容的小变化，使其看起来不是完全复制的，来逃避版权和许可的侵犯。投诉称，“Copilot 是一种巧妙的软件盗版方法”。


消息来源：The Register



老王点评：到底改变多少才不算抄袭呢？或许，我觉得更公平的做法是，在输出代码时提示该代码衍生自哪种许可证的代码，因此受哪种许可证影响，如何使用取决于用户自己。但似乎这样做存在一些技术困难，因为 AI 到底是如何糅合出新的代码，对人类来说还是一个黑盒。




Reddit 封杀第三方客户端之后的社区反应

之前，我们 报道 过， Reddit 大幅调整了其 API 价格，事实上扼杀了第三方客户端。出于对此政策的极度不满，Reddit 社区将于 6 月 12 日举行大规模抗议活动，参与抗议的大部分子区将关闭 48 小时，但还有部分将无限期关闭。ArchiveTeam 团队希望赶在 12 日之前 存档 内容，他们目前已存档了 108 亿个帖子（包括帖子内容、评论和图像），还有 1.5 亿个帖子等待完成，团队表示时间来不及了，希望更多人参与帮助。此外，著名的 Reddit 第三方 iOS 客户端 Apollo 宣布将于 6 月 30 日 关闭 该客户端，并 公开 了其后端源代码以示它是合法使用 API，并遵守了 API 的速率限制。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[在失去亲人后为开源项目做贡献可能会让人感到畏惧。下面是我对如何重新加入社区的建议。


开源社区是一个奇妙的地方，在这里人们聚集在一起合作，分享知识，并建立令人惊奇的东西。我还记得 12 年前 我在 Fedora 的第一次贡献，从那时起，这就是一个奇妙的旅程。然而，生活有时会妨碍我们，导致我们从参与中抽身。COVID-19 大流行病以不同的方式影响了我们所有人，对一些人来说，这是一个巨大的损失和悲痛的时期。我在大流行期间失去了我的爱人，这是最难处理的生活事件。这也让我从 Fedora 社区休息了一段时间。对于那些因为失去亲人而不得不休息的开源社区成员来说，重新回到编码和为项目做贡献可能会让人感到畏惧。然而，通过一些思考和计划，有可能卷土重来，再次成为社区的积极成员。

首先，最重要的是照顾好自己，让自己有时间和空间去悲伤。悲伤是一种个人和独特的经历。没有正确或错误的方式去经历它。重要的是要善待自己。在你准备好之前，不要急于做事情。

当你准备好重新开始贡献，你可以做几件事来使你的复出尽可能顺利。

与其他贡献者联系

这是一个艰难的事实：没有什么东西会因为你而停止，技术正在以指数形式增长。当我最近重新加入 Fedora 的时候，我觉得世界在我身边变化得太快了。从 IRC 到 Telegram 再到 Signal 和 Matrix，从 IRC 会议 到谷歌会议，从 Pagure 到 GitLab，从邮件列表到讨论区，这个名单还在继续。如果你有一段时间没有在你的社区里活动，联系你在社区里的朋友，让他们知道你回来了，并准备再次做出贡献，这可能会有帮助。这可以帮助你与人们重新建立联系，并重新进入事情的轨道。他们可能有一些建议或机会让你参与其中。我很感谢我的 Fedora 朋友 Justin W. Flory，他无私地帮助我，确保我找到了回到社区的方法。

从小事做起

过去，我曾担任 Fedora 多样性、公平和包容（D.E.I.）顾问，这是 Fedora 理事会 成员职位之一。这是一个很大的工作。我认识到这一点，而且我知道如果我在休息后立即考虑做同样的工作，那么这将是一个负担，有可能导致 早期倦怠。放轻松是非常重要的。从小事做起。

如果你对重新投入一个大项目的想法感到不知所措，那就从小事做起。有大量的小任务和错误需要修复，解决其中的一个问题可以帮助你轻松地回到社区。

找一个导师

如果你对如何开始或将你的努力集中在哪里感到不确定，可以考虑找一个 导师。导师（就我而言，是 Justin W. Flory）可以在你复出时提供指导、建议和支持。

展示感激

开源社区是建立在许多人的贡献之上的。一个健康的社区会对你的贡献表示感谢。表达感激之情是使社区健康发展的一部分。对那些帮助你、指导你、给你反馈的人表示感谢。

封锁你的日历

最初，可能需要一些时间来恢复贡献的节奏。在你的日历中安排一些时间用于开源工作是有帮助的。它可以是每周/每两周一次，取决于你的可用性。记住，每一个贡献都很重要，这就是开源世界的魅力所在。这个技巧将帮助你养成规律的作息习惯。

向前两步，向后一步

最后，重要的是要记住，如果你需要，退一步也没关系。悲伤不是一个线性过程。你可能会发现，你在未来需要再次休息一下。重要的是，要对自己和他人诚实，了解自己的需求。利用你需要的时间来照顾自己。

按照你自己的条件返回

在经历了一段时间的悲痛之后，回到开源社区可能是一种挑战。这也是一个与你所热衷的事物重新联系的机会，并对世界产生积极影响。随着时间的推移，你会发现你能够从你离开的地方拾起，并再次重新参与到社区中。

我把我的第一篇 Opensource.com 文章献给我已故的弟弟 Nalin Sharma 先生，他在 2021 年因 COVID-19 而离开我们，年仅 32 岁。他是一个充满激情的工程师，充满了生命力。我希望他现在在一个更好的地方，我相信他将永远活在我的记忆中。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[又一次，Linus Torvalds 立场坚定地、咆哮地小小回复了某人。




Linus Torvalds 又发表了一篇热点看法（或争议？）🐧

一切都始于 Linus Torvalds 对《纽约时报》网页体验的看法。

在 social.kernel.org 上发布的一篇公开帖子中，Linus 抱怨了纽约时报网站上的广告和糟糕的用户体验。此外，他还感到烦恼的是，人们必须致电该网站团队才能取消订阅纽约时报。

下面是他的发帖：



但是，这与我们新闻标题毫不相关，是吗？😕

是有点无关，但这件事还有更多的内容。

实际上，Linus 在 他的帖子 中继续向他的一些粉丝解释，他并不介意订阅纽约时报，但是由于令人讨厌的体验，这变成了一项不可接受的条件。

在他的帖子的一条评论中，一位用户还提到纽约时报不值得关注，并将其称为“清醒的共产主义宣传”。

以下是该用户的原文：



虽然这与最初讨论的上下文无关，但 Linus Torvalds 坚定的表明了他对这种观点的信仰。



他的回复如下：


我觉得你可能不应该关注我，因为你那个“清醒的共产主义宣传”的评论让我觉得你是一个一流的白痴。我强烈怀疑我就是你担心的那些“清醒的共产主义者”之一。但你可能无法解释这两个词的任何一个真正意思，对吧？


此外，他还分享了下面这段话：


我是一名持证的无神论者，我认为妇女的选择权非常重要，我认为“有组织的民兵”意味着应该仔细发放枪支许可证，而不是随便给予任何有脉搏的白痴，我一点也不在意你决定穿“错误”的衣服或者决定不为你出生时的性别所束缚。该死的，如果这些让我成为“清醒”的人，那么我认为使用这个词作为贬义词的任何人都是人类的耻辱。所以请立刻取消关注我吧。


虽然这只是社交媒体上的一次言论碰撞，但他的回复被一些人视为有争议，有些人将他标签为“左派”（不管这是什么意思）。

当然，还有其他人认为 Linus Torvalds 正确地表达了他想要说的话，这没有什么不对的。如果你了解 Linus Torvalds，你会知道他通常直言不讳地表达自己的观点。

就像他最近对 Linux 6.3 的 一个糟糕的提交请求 感到愤怒一样。

在这里，我们不讨论具体问题。当然，我们关注的是 Linux 和开源软件……还有 Linus Torvalds 😉

但是，从回复中可以看出，Linus Torvalds 似乎不喜欢用“清醒”一词来贬低某些事物。他明显尊重其他人的选择，并且“一点也不在意”。

💬你认为 Linus Torvalds 对“清醒的共产主义”意识形态的看法怎么样？请在下方评论区分享你的想法。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[两位意义不同的“杨老师”
杨志洵，字（或号）景苏，亦作劲苏、劲素，江苏金匮（今无锡市）人，卒于1939年，生年不详。他不算是一个名人，却被文史爱好者不时提到。人们对他的兴趣和了解主要来自两组关系，以下略为分解。
其一，杨志洵在胡适的早年进学之路上发挥过关键作用，是后者终生铭感的恩师。1910年，沉沦上海的胡适受许怡荪、程乐亭等友人劝告资助，进京应考庚款留美。在北京，二哥胡觉（字绍之）的好友杨志洵“厚待”之，介绍他“住在新在建筑中的女子师范学校（后来的女师大）校舍里”；考取后南下上海，旅费也是杨志洵借他的，后由胡觉代为归还（1911年1月10日胡觉致胡适信，《胡适遗稿及秘藏书信》，黄山书社1994年版）。
这场耽搁不过月馀，胡适就录取赴美了，留下的印象却非常美好，至以“怜我无家能慰我，佳儿娇女倍情亲”的诗句来形容。两年后的圣诞节，胡适在美国受到白特生（Patterson）夫妇“有如家人骨肉”般的招待，感激之馀，想到的是：“前在都门，杨景苏夫妇亦复如是。”（1912年12月25日日记，《胡适日记全集》，联经出版公司2004年版）
除了生活上的照顾，杨氏还辅导胡适功课，给予他学术上的关键点拨：
杨先生指点我读旧书，要我从《十三经注疏》用功起。我读汉儒的经学，是从这个时候起的。（《四十自述》，亚东图书馆1939年版）

胡适《四十自述》手稿中的杨志洵

这里说得较为简略，更详细的指导过程，可从胡适当时写给许怡荪的信里窥见端倪：
昨向友人处借得《十三经注疏》读之，始知讲经非从古注入手不可。古注虽亦有大谬之处，然参考众说，可得其真意；再以朱子集注参观之，以新文法旁证之，说经之奥，尽于此矣。甚望足下先从经入手，以史辅之，一二年后根柢定矣，然后从事文艺，乃为有根据之学问。（1910年7月18日函，《胡适许怡荪通信集》，上海人民出版社2017年版）

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The current events of Reddit and Stack Exchange amplifying a thought that communities and users' contributions should be decentralized. The current structure of online communication poses a major risk.
1. There has to be a movement at both protocol and community-level to bring a Usenet like forum for general consumption. Different decetralized subgroups hosting and replicating the communities for others.
2. The model needs to be rethought to ensure that the thoughts and knowledge of communities and users belong to them.
3. These forums should encourage less anonymity and more persistent communication.
4. Trustworthy individuals should run these forums, chosen by the community. Individual groups, academia, organizations running the communities but easily redistributed across to people who want it. This was usenet.
Failure to address these issues allows mega companies to exploit data and control access against users' wishes.
Taking action is crucial to prevent unfavorable outcomes and hold ourselves accountable.

subject of a session led by VFS co-maintainer Christian Brauner at the
2023 Linux Storage, Filesystem,
Memory-Management and BPF Summit.  As might be guessed, it was a
filesystem-track session; Brauner had three separate items he planned on
bringing up, but the discussion on the first two consumed the whole
half-hour—and then some.  A mechanism to avoid media-change races when
mounting loop (or loopback) and other devices was disposed of fairly
quickly, but the 
discussion around the mount-beneath feature went on at length.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Priority inversion comes about when a low-priority task holds a resource
that is needed by a higher-priority task, with the result that the wrong
task is the only one that can run.  This problem is arguably most acute in
realtime settings, but it can happen in just about any system that has
multiple tasks running.  The variety of
scheduling classes provided by the Linux kernel make handling priority
inversion a difficult problem; the latest version of the proxy
execution patch series points toward a possible solution.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Vivaldi 将伪装成 Edge 以让用户使用必应聊天

很多网站和服务会根据用户代理（UA）字符串来限制浏览器访问，比如谷歌的一些服务。Vivaldi 在 2019 年修改了 UA 冒充 Chrome 以实现更好的谷歌服务兼容性。而最近，微软的基于 GPT-4 的必应聊天也限制只能在 Edge 浏览器中使用，因此，最新版本的 Vivaldi 将能冒充 Edge 浏览器以帮助用户绕过使用限制。


消息来源：Vivaldi



老王点评：虽然说是让用户方便了，但是总感觉这种做法不够大气，像这样的功能，就不应该是浏览器官方提供的功能，而应该是第三方插件的功能。




邮件网关厂商让用户更换有漏洞的设备而不是打补丁升级

Barracuda 公司的电子邮件安全网关（ESG）负责扫描所有传入和传出的电子邮件以查找恶意软件。在收到关于来自其 ESG 设备的异常流量的报告后，该公司发现恶意流量是利用了其 ESG 设备中一个以前未知的漏洞，于是向所有受影响的设备推送了一个漏洞补丁。到这里都还是正常的剧本。令人震惊的是，该公司突然开始敦促其 ESG 客户批量废弃并更换受影响的设备，而不是打补丁。并且，该公司还说 ESG 客户还应该轮换与设备相连的任何凭证。


消息来源：Krebs on Security



老王点评：这操作委实厉害，连软件更新都无法挽救了。




iOS 17 会自动删除链接的跟踪参数

在链接中添加跟踪参数是广告商和分析公司试图跟踪用户在网站上的活动的一种方式。与其存储第三方 Cookie，不如简单地将跟踪标识符添加到页面 URL 的末端，这将规避 Safari 的标准智能跟踪预防功能。iOS 17 和 macOS Sonoma 将新增链接跟踪保护功能，在邮件、信息和 Safari 浏览器的私人浏览模式下自动激活。它可以检测到链接 URL 中可识别的用户跟踪参数，并自动将其删除。


消息来源：9to5mac



老王点评：这是完全不给广告商留路的做法啊，这里的跟踪参数估计不少是谷歌的吧。]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[采用基于开源原则的组织治理可以引导你的组织降低成本，降低技术债务，增加团队协作，促进创新，最重要的是，推动你的组织共同前进。


在我的职业生涯中，我很幸运地与许多不同规模的组织在各种项目上合作。所有这些项目的核心都是开源软件，而且大多数人都对开源社区做出了力所能及的回报。我最近在一个大型组织内从事一个使用开源软件的绿地项目。在项目的 MVP 阶段结束后，该组织的领导层很想知道是什么导致了项目的成功，以及他们如何将其应用到整个组织的其他团队中。经过思考，我发现我们团队的工作方式与开源社区和开发之间有相似之处。以下是对开源原则如何帮助组织节省资金、减少技术债务 和打破内部孤岛的一些见解。

1、更好地使用预算

我最近在佛罗里达 Drupal 营地发表了关于 无头全渠道网络平台 的演讲。演讲中强调的主要好处之一是如何通过实施这种网络平台来节省资金。这个想法来自于开源软件的开发。一个组织内的不同小组可以利用他们的预算来为一个核心软件或平台贡献特性或功能。他们还可以与其他小组合作，集中资金开发更复杂的功能。当功能开发完成后，它将被添加到核心软件或平台中，供所有人使用。使用这种开源原则可以为组织内的团体提供互利。允许共享特性和功能，并集体从彼此的支出中获益，可以改善软件或平台。

这种方法的另一个方面是可以节省开支，并允许持续改进，即对一个功能进行一次测试和开发，并重复使用它。在创建一个使用基于组件的设计系统作为起点的网络平台时，我们经常看到这种情况。该平台的用户可以重复使用其他用户开发的组件或功能。通常，这些都已经经过了无数次的测试，比如用户体验、可及性，甚至是安全测试。

这个简单的想法在许多组织中面临反对，因为个别团体觊觎和保护预算。团体不愿意放弃他们的预算来支持核心软件或平台。某些情况下，优先级和意见上的差异加剧了许多机构的孤岛化。

2、减少技术债务

许多机构努力减少技术债务。实施一个全面的核心软件或平台并使用开源原则，可以帮助减少技术债务。这可以通过允许开发团队充分考虑一个功能不仅对建立它的小组，而且对更广泛的组织有什么影响。这一点，加上与组织内其他小组的合作，可以帮助减少未来重建或增加功能的需要。

有时，由于内部竞争，组织在这种合作和思考方面会有困难。一些公司培养了一种文化，即第一个建立一个功能或提出一个想法会得到奖励。这可能会导致各小组不一起工作或分享想法，在组织内形成孤岛，大大阻碍了创新。

3、更快进入市场

我经常听到的一句话是“更快进入市场”。每个人都想更快、更容易地把他们的东西推出去。这通常是一个核心软件或平台的好处，因为内部团体可以重用现有的、经过测试和验证的特性和功能，而不是从头开始建立自己的功能。如果你的团队正在启动一个项目，而它可以从 80% 的完成度而不是 0% 的完成度开始，你会这样做吗？我想是的。现在再加上为其他用户增加所需功能的超级英雄感觉。这是一个双赢的结果！

4、发布兴奋点

另一个可以帮助你的组织的伟大的开源原则是建立兴奋的发布时间表。当你的组织实施一个核心软件或平台时，用户会对更新的时间进行投资。一个发布时间表和路线图可以向他们传达这一点。这两个工具可以帮助用户对新功能感到兴奋，并相应地规划他们自己的路线图。这也有助于建立对其他团队的欣赏，以及对建立新功能的团队的自豪感。这可以统一一个组织，让组织有团队合作和成就感，同时提供结构和未来的计划。

5、一个核心团队和管理

我发现你需要两个关键项目来克服上述障碍，并在你的组织内成功应用开源原则。这就是： 一个核心团队和坚实的组织管理。一个核心团队将允许一个小组来维护和管理你的组织的核心软件或平台。它将支持该解决方案，并确保明智地增加新的特性和功能。这个团队可以帮助减少内部团队的成本，并告知各组路线图的功能。核心团队需要得到强大的组织治理的支持。这种治理将为组织内的小组提供一个共同的方向和组织支持，以取得成功。这种组织治理可以在几个方面模仿开源的治理和原则。最基本和最高级别的原则是社区和为共同目标而工作的理念。

开放式领导

采用基于 开源原则 的组织治理可以引导你的组织降低成本，降低技术债务，增加团队协作，促进创新，最重要的是，推动你的组织共同前进。

我们生活在一个激动人心的时代。不久之前，我们都被束缚在“升级跑步机”上，被迫每隔几年购买昂贵的新电脑。

今天，借助开源软件的好处，你可以打破这种循环。其中一种方法是 翻新旧电脑，让它们继续发挥作用。本文告诉你如何实现。

1、找一台旧电脑

也许你的地下室或仓库里有一台闲置的旧电脑，为什么不利用一下呢？

或者你可以从朋友、家人或二手广告中得到一台旧机器。许多电子回收中心会让你四处翻找并带走一台你看上的被抛弃的机器。如果可以的话，务必多带回来几台，因为你可能需要从几台被弃置的电脑中获取零件来组装成一台好的电脑。

看看机器前面的贴纸，确保选择的是好的可供翻新的机器。带有 Windows 7 和 8 标志的电脑非常适合运行 Linux。对于 8.1，其扩展支持已于今年 1 月份结束，所以我看到很多这样的电脑被丢弃。

很多这些 Windows 电脑提供了完全良好的硬件。它们只是因为计划性过时而被丢弃了，因为它们不能运行 Windows 11。但是它们可以很好地运行开源软件。

2、确认并清洁所有零件

在打开你的“新”机器之前，确保通过触摸金属物品消除静电。有可能一点点的静电都会破坏精细的电路。

你需要马上查看是否缺失了零件。许多人在丢弃电脑之前会取出它们的硬盘或内存条。你要么需要获取多台机器来解决这一点，要么就需要购买一两个零件来使它完整。

在进一步操作之前，给机器做彻底的清洁非常重要。特别注意 CPU 的复杂结构、风扇和所有表面。请记住，你不能用抹布来清洁电子设备，否则会有损坏的风险，因此使用压缩空气来清洁。

3、确保所有硬件均正常工作

在安装任何软件之前，你需要验证所有硬件是否正常工作。不要省略测试！如果你在进行下一步操作之前只是短暂运行了内存测试，并在以后发现你的计算机…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[1943年初，李香兰在她寄寓的华懋饭店接受了日本友人都筑修一郎的专访。成稿后来刊登在同年1月16日的《新申报》第四版，文中，作者提及影星大日方传因为当兵也来了中国，李香兰答道：“说起大日方传，他与山田五十玲女史来上海摄制《上海之月》的时候，大家都在一块儿玩过，他立刻能奉上顺下，成了所谓的上海人，大踏步地走着。”我没看过《上海之月》（上海の月），这部电影在成濑巳喜男的导演作品里是一个鲜为人知的特例，造成这种局面的主因是胶片的散佚；成濑巳喜男一生导演了八十九部电影，存世六十七部半，这最特殊的半部便是《上海之月》（原作一百一十四分钟，现存拷贝五十三分钟）。

《上海之月》剧照，左起：大日方传，山田五十玲

成濑在中国拥有广大的影迷，但是他们中的多数人并不清楚这位电影大师来过中国。李香兰的回忆为成濑的上海之行添了细节，而在凯瑟琳·罗素那本近六百页的成濑专著里，它只是干巴巴的一句：“成濑来到上海拍摄了这部《上海之月》，但正如彼得·海伊指出的，他自己远离电影所暗示的帝国主义狂热。”（《成濑巳喜男的电影》，复旦大学出版社，2014年10月版，180页）
关于成濑去上海拍摄电影，彼得·海伊（Peter B. High）在《帝国的银幕》中这样写道：“成濑巳喜男的情况与沟口健二、小津安二郎相似。尽管明显受到了一些压力，他同样力图避免公开的军事宣传……《上海之月》这部聚焦中国的政治宣传电台的谍战剧情片，代表了他在国策电影这个领域最具雄心的一次努力。”作者随后摘引了成濑1941年接受日本电影杂志采访时讲的一段话：“我在上海的时候尽可能多看美国电影……如果其他电影人也有类似的机会去感受美国所取得的精彩进展，日本电影也会突飞猛进的。”（The Imperial Screen，University of Wisconsin Press，2003年版，187页）
除了私淑美国电影，成濑在上海还“偷师”中国…]]></summary>

It was distributed via popular Minecraft modpack site CurseForge. Upon execution it creates a systemd daemon to retain persistence and it steals browser credentials. Here is a full explanation of it and steps to detect and remove it from your system:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[1943年初，李香兰在她寄寓的华懋饭店接受了日本友人都筑修一郎的专访。成稿后来刊登在同年1月16日的《新申报》第四版，文中，作者提及影星大日方传因为当兵也来了中国，李香兰答道：“说起大日方传，他与山田五十玲女史来上海摄制《上海之月》的时候，大家都在一块儿玩过，他立刻能奉上顺下，成了所谓的上海人，大踏步地走着。”我没看过《上海之月》（上海の月），这部电影在成濑巳喜男的导演作品里是一个鲜为人知的特例，造成这种局面的主因是胶片的散佚；成濑巳喜男一生导演了八十九部电影，存世六十七部半，这最特殊的半部便是《上海之月》（原作一百一十四分钟，现存拷贝五十三分钟）。

《上海之月》剧照，左起：大日方传，山田五十玲

成濑在中国拥有广大的影迷，但是他们中的多数人并不清楚这位电影大师来过中国。李香兰的回忆为成濑的上海之行添了细节，而在凯瑟琳·罗素那本近六百页的成濑专著里，它只是干巴巴的一句：“成濑来到上海拍摄了这部《上海之月》，但正如彼得·海伊指出的，他自己远离电影所暗示的帝国主义狂热。”（《成濑巳喜男的电影》，复旦大学出版社，2014年10月版，180页）
关于成濑去上海拍摄电影，彼得·海伊（Peter B. High）在《帝国的银幕》中这样写道：“成濑巳喜男的情况与沟口健二、小津安二郎相似。尽管明显受到了一些压力，他同样力图避免公开的军事宣传……《上海之月》这部聚焦中国的政治宣传电台的谍战剧情片，代表了他在国策电影这个领域最具雄心的一次努力。”作者随后摘引了成濑1941年接受日本电影杂志采访时讲的一段话：“我在上海的时候尽可能多看美国电影……如果其他电影人也有类似的机会去感受美国所取得的精彩进展，日本电影也会突飞猛进的。”（The Imperial Screen，University of Wisconsin Press，2003年版，187页）
除了私淑美国电影，成濑在上海还“偷师”中国…]]></summary>

 As you may or may not know, there's an app called Shortcat for Mac, which is amazingly cool: it allows you to navigate the "whole" UI using the keyboard (something like Vimium in the browser, but for all the "normal" windows)
 I has quite a bunch of extra features (finding emojis etc.), and it even works in Electron apps (I think they tend to be different than "normal" windows in all OSes)
 I was wondering if there's a similar app for Linux that I'm not aware.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi All, I have a fun linux admin challenge that has me sweating a bit. I have a fleet of AWS Lightsail VPS servers running basic wordpress / mysql. They're managed by the Plesk dashboard but generally Ubuntu servers. I stood them up five years ago on Ubuntu 16.04, then upgraded remotely over SSH to Ubuntu 18.04. 
 Now it's two years later and I just upgrade to 20.04. Things generally fine but I realize it has a very old network config, and some ipv6 scraps I want to fix. That means a fully remote, non-console, no boot from USB, SSH network package re-configuration. Any disconnect means a reboot or bricked box. I found the below online and thinking to script it but if it crashes then I'm restoring from a backup. 
 Any super skills or ideas for how to handle this? Alternate SSH windows won't help if I'm stopping and restarting eth0. Am I overthinking this and it just works? It's a simple auto ip4 dhcp nic config under a standard EC2 hypervisor, aws virtual nic driver
 Some suggestions found here: https://gist.github.com/mss/7a8e048dd51e5ef928039f1450ba8f31 
 apt install netplan.io
 systemctl unmask systemd-networkd.service
 systemctl unmask systemd-resolved.service
 ENABLE_TEST_COMMANDS=1 netplan migrate
 netplan try
 reboot
 apt purge ifupdown resolvconf
 ln -sf /run/systemd/resolve/stub-resolv.conf /etc/resolv.conf

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am now required to use a Linux machine as a NAS. But I am absolutely terrified. Let me explain.
 Back in 2020, I had a Windows 10 machine and a Debian 10 machine. I needed to sneakernet a file. I plugged an NTFS formatted USB Drive into Windows, copied the file, and unplugged it. Then plugged it inside the Debian machine.
 The file disappeared. I plugged it and unplugged it a few times and it still wasn't there. I plug the USB drive into Windows, and it tells me that I need to format it. Inspecting Partition Manager, I find out the USB Drive is no longer NTFS, but RAW.
 No big deal, I say. It's probably a dead USB Drive. I'll just use another one. I plugged an NTFS formatted USB Drive into Windows, copied the file, and unplugged it. Then plugged it inside the Debian machine. The file disappeared. I plugged it and unplugged it a few times and it still wasn't there. I plug the USB drive into Windows, and it tells me that I need to format it. Inspecting Partition Manager, I find out the USB Drive is no longer NTFS, but RAW.
 To figure out what was going on, I plug both USB Drives into AOMEI.
 To my sheer horror, after hours of investigating, I find out that 90% of all Linux distros will automatically, WITHOUT YOUR CONSENT, format any drive you plug in to EXT4.
 I haven't touched a Linux machine since. But now, thanks to Windows 11, I might be forced to. I have to plug in a 4TB NTFS drive, AND it's identical backup, into a Debian 12 machine, knowing that at any moment it might randomly format BOTH the main AND the backup to EXT4 and I will lose absolutely everything. How do I overcome this fear? Has this issue even been fixed?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[人工智能发现了更快的排序算法

谷歌 Deepmind 的新 AI 系统 AlphaDev 使用深度学习发现了更快的排序算法。他们采取了与国际象棋和围棋相同的方法：把代码优化变成了一种游戏。AlphaDev 开发了 x86 汇编算法，将代码的延迟视为一个分数，并试图将这个分数降到最低，同时确保代码运行到完成时没有错误。他们希望将新的算法纳入到 LLVM 的 C++ 排序库中，不过问题是，这些代码是用汇编而不是C++，因此，他们不得不反向移植，找出能够产生相同汇编的 C++ 代码。研究人员称，这是排序库算法方面十年来的首次突破。新算法对较短序列的排序速度提升了最高 70%，而对超过 25 万个元素的长序列速度提升了 1.7%。


消息来源：Ars Technica



老王点评：能优化算法的人工智能，也就是说，人类在智力方面都会被人工智能超越。




OpenAI 还没有训练 GPT-5

3 月底，诸多人工智能领域的专家和科技高管签署公开信，呼吁 “所有人工智能实验室立即暂停训练比 GPT-4 更强大的人工智能系统至少 6 个月”。OpenAI 对此回应称，它还没有开始训练 GPT-5，而且在 “一段时间内” 不打算这样做。OpenAI 说，“当我们完成 GPT-4 时，在准备好发布它之前，我们花了六个多月的时间。”


消息来源：Tech Crunch



老王点评：就目前而言，可能我们需要的不是更强大的人工智能，而是成本更低的、消除 AI 鸿沟的人工智能。




苹果推出在 Mac 上运行 Windows 游戏的工具

苹果宣布，通过一个类似于 Valve 的 Proton 的环境，可以在 macOS 上翻译和运行最新的 DirectX 12 Windows 游戏，使得将 Windows 游戏移植到 Mac 上变得更加容易和快捷。和 Proton 一样，它是基于 CrossOver 的代码的。


消息来源：The Verge



老王点评：说到底，大家都在 Windows 上玩游戏，连 Mac 也开始眼馋这一块了。]]></summary>

Lua 是一种有时会被误解的语言。它与 Python 等其他语言不同，但它是一种通用的扩展语言，广泛用于游戏引擎、框架等。总的来说，我发现 Lua 对开发人员来说是一个有价值的工具，可以让他们以一些强大的方式增强和扩展他们的项目。

你可以按照 Seth Kenlon 的文章《Lua 值得学习吗？》的介绍下载并运行常用的 Lua，该文章中还包括了简单的 Lua 代码示例。但是，要充分利用 Lua，最好将它与采用该语言的框架一起使用。在本教程中，我演示了如何使用名为 Mako Server 的框架，该框架旨在使 Lua 程序员能够轻松地编写 IoT 和 Web 应用代码。我还向你展示了如何使用 API 扩展此框架以使用树莓派的 GPIO 引脚。

要求

在学习本教程之前，你需要一个可以登录的正在运行的树莓派。虽然我将在本教程中编译 C 代码，但你不需要任何 C 代码经验。但是，你需要一些使用 POSIX 终端的经验。

安装

首先，在树莓派上打开一个终端窗口并安装以下工具，以使用 Git 下载代码和编译 C 代码：

$ sudo apt install git unzip gcc make


接下来，通过运行以下命令编译开源 Mako Server 代码和 lua-periphery 库（树莓派的 GPIO 库）：

$ wget -O Mako-Server-Build.sh \
  https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RealTimeLogic/BAS/main/RaspberryPiBuild.sh


查看脚本以了解它的作用，并在你觉得没问题后运行它：

$ sh ./Mako-Serv…]]></summary>

💡 “孵化器”分组包含的项目属于 GNOME 核心和 GNOME 开发工具的一部分，这代表着 可能有一天它们会进入 GNOME 的发布版本。


🆕 Loupe 是什么？



因此，正如我所说，这是一款适用于 GNOME 的新图像查看器应用，它 用内存安全的 Rust 编程语言编写，并提供一些很酷的功能。

例如，屏幕上的按钮可以切换各种照片、放大/缩小、进入全屏模式等等。

然后是元数据查看器，它已很好地集成到界面中，显示 位置、大小、分辨率、创建日期 等数据。



不止如此，Loupe 还支持键盘和触控板快捷键！你自己看。



这些键盘/触控板快捷方式和手势对笔记本电脑用户来说应该很方便。

这对于触摸屏来说很好 🤗

另外，我怎么能忘记可以分别从功能区菜单和标题访问的 复制到剪贴板、移动到垃圾箱和 打印图像 选项？

这是实际操作：




很整洁，不是吗？

我必须说，Loupe 有一套漂亮的功能，我发现自己每天在浏览照片时都在使用它。

它旨在取代现有的 Eye of GNOME（eog）图片查看器，当然，除非有任何问题，否则可能会随着 GNOME 45 的发布而出现。

📥 获取 Loupe

你可以从 Flathub 商店 获取 Loupe，还可以在 GitLab 上探索其源代码。


Loupe（Flathub）


💬 你怎么看？ 作为 GNOME 上的默认图像查看器，Loupe 会是一个不错的选择吗？

彼得·盖伊（Peter Gay， 1923-2015）的《现实主义的报复：历史学家读〈荒凉山庄〉〈包法利夫人〉〈布登勃洛克一家〉》（原书名Savage Reprisals: Bleak House， Madame Bovary， Buddenbrooks，2002；刘森尧译，北京联合出版公司，2023年3月） 在多年前就有过同一译者的中译本《历史学家的三堂小说课》（北京大学出版社，2006年）。新译本的文字略有修订，插图从旧译本的十幅减为三幅，最重要的变化是书名改了。原著书名“Savage Reprisals”意为“野蛮的报复”，作者指的是十九世纪那些感受到社会不公与压迫的现实主义作家在小说中对社会的报复。旧译本的书名则完全另起炉灶，让读者真的以为就是听一位历史学家在课堂上谈小说。新译本把“报复”恢复并凸显出来，这是非常重要的修正，至于以“现实主义”取代“野蛮”，对于读者来说也有必要。对于早已熟悉现实主义文艺ABC的读者来说，今天的“现实主义的报复”似乎有新的双重意义：一是在文学理论中重新重视被淡化的文学对现实世界的“报复”，二是在今天的文艺与现实语境中分辨和研究现实主义文艺中的“报复”类型，研究其如何积聚愤怒与实施“报复”。十几年前我就读过这“三堂小说课”，但直到今天才真正进入那个被现实主义“报复”的历史与现实的阅读语境之中，重新思考现实主义的“报复”动机和“野蛮的”力量如何书写新的文学史与社会史。
该书的论述主题和内容并不复杂，盖伊运用了文学批评与历史研究和心理学分析相结合的方法，详细解读了三部伟大的现实主义小说：狄更斯《荒凉山庄》、福楼拜《包法利夫人》和托马斯·曼的《布登勃洛克一家》，指出这…]]></summary>

一、生存压力与社会秩序
在中国第一历史档案馆，笔者曾发现一份奏折，是清代四川重庆镇总兵张士庆向乾隆皇帝奏请关于该如何处理那些千里迢迢跑到该地卖娼的流民。张士庆被此事困扰许久：卖娼这种行为终究有伤风化，若不严加管理，定会严重影响社会秩序，然而多数卖娼妇女确属生活所迫，不得已而为之，到底该如何处理这一恼人的难题呢？我们不妨先来看看这位总兵是如何向皇帝上奏此事的：
查川省茂州汶川保县等处在万山之中，地土贫瘠，米粮稀少，每年九、十月间多有蛮民携妻来重，于城外河坝空地打棚盖茅棚佣工觅食，约计百余户或至二百余户不等，至春暖方归。内有一等无耻奸蛮，于彼典雇妻女，混杂居住处卖娼作活，岁以为常相……查茂汶至重庆往返程途不下四千里，穷蛮远涉，资釜艰难。若果听其远来又将其驱逐，不如与本地方先行查禁，免令长途往回……受人典雇之妇固非善类，其他妇女虽非俱系典雇而来，但千里长途男女混杂，难保其尽守妇道，俱属善良。且奸蛮携妇女外出，绝不会自露出典雇妻之情，而所在盘查之处亦恐不能逐户查出竟无一二遗漏。查此等不良妇女大概俱属年少之人，以后是否可除年至四十以上蛮妇仍听携带出外佣工往来居住不禁外，其年少妇女悉行禁止，不许仍携远出，则不良少妇既难混远行，而奸蛮雇妇为娼之处将不禁而自熄（息）。（《四川重庆镇总兵张士庆奏为严查奸蛮典雇妇女为娼事》，第一历史档案馆，档号：04-01-01-0010-034）
在这位总兵看来，与其发现后再驱逐那些卖娼妇女，倒不如直接让她们原籍所在地的官员严加管理，法律禁止四十岁以下妇女私自到外佣工，严格限制这些年轻妇女自由迁徙，卖娼就会自动消失，社会秩序自然恢复。对这些年轻妇女的迁徙进行严格规制，卖娼就会被根除吗？奏折所叙述的现象是十八世纪中国社会的个案吗？…]]></summary>

However, I found it cumbersome to keep the GUI open just to check if ufw was enabled or not. To address this, I created a visual indicator for the GNOME status bar that provides a quick glance at the ufw status.
 I developed this indicator as a user-friendly GNOME Shell extension, which can be easily installed. If you're interested, you can find it on GitHub at https://github.com/illtellyoulater/ufw-status-indicator. The repository includes screenshots and simple installation instructions.
 I hope someone here finds it useful Feel free to give it a try and let me know what you think about it.

 like I said in the title this is a very simple program I wrote in Rust for fun. I'm not a programmer, I know the way I've done this is a bit janky. it's meant to be more like a weird novelty and not for any practical use. I put 31 normal recipes and some cooking with marijuana + there's jokes and conspiracy theories. if you are familiar with Some Ordinary Gamers dank web browsing there's some things you might recognize from his videos in this.
 the terminal emulator I'm using in the above screenshot is cool retro term, you can use any emulator.

the debate around the composefs read-only,
integrity-protected 
filesystem, it was predicted that the topic would come up at the
2023 Linux Storage, Filesystem,
Memory-Management and BPF Summit.  That happened on the second day of
the summit when
Alexander Larsson led a session on composefs.  While the mailing-list
discussion was 
somewhat contentious, the session was less so, since overlayfs can
be made to fit the needs of the composefs use cases.  It turns
out that an entirely new

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[苹果 Safari 浏览器支持了被谷歌放弃的 JPEG XL

谷歌去年以“整个生态系统没有足够的兴趣来继续试验 JPEG XL”的 理由，废弃了在 Chromium 中支持 JPEG XL 图像格式的支持。此举引来了社区的强烈反对，但谷歌置之不理。而在苹果新发布的 Safari 17 测试版中，它支持了 JPEG XL，这让更多人呼吁谷歌重新审视其决定。当然，我们有理由怀疑谷歌做出这种决定的原因，因为用户将得到的谷歌自己控制的、受专利保护的 AVIF 格式，而 JPEG XL 不受专利的约束，也不需要专利软件。


消息来源：The Register



老王点评：真是风水轮流转，原本看起来封闭的苹果却在这件事上打脸了谷歌。




CNET 修订其人工智能政策并更新过去的文章

在科技媒体 CNET 悄悄开始用生成性人工智能制作文章的 消息 传出几个月后，他们修订了其人工智能政策。CNET 将不会完全使用人工智能工具来写文章，产品的实际审查和测试将由人类完成，而是用人工智能工具来分类和分析数据，为文章创建大纲，分析现有文本，并生成解释性内容。此外，CNET 更新了之前发表的几十篇使用人工智能系统生成的文章，其中一些文章包含事实错误，而另一些替换了其中“不完全是原创的短语”。


消息来源：The Verge



老王点评：就目前而言，完全用人工智能来写报道和文章，显然是不合适的，但是用人工智能来帮助写文章，显然是一件有利于提高工作效率和质量的好事。




利用人工智能生成动漫二维码

有人发布了一系列使用稳定扩散 AI 图像合成模型创建的艺术二维码，这些二维码仍然可以被智能手机的相机应用程序作为功能性二维码来读取。创作者没有详细说明用于创建新奇代码的具体技术，但他们似乎训练了几个定制的稳定扩散 ControlNet 模型（加上 LoRA 微调），这些模型已经被调整成可以创建不同风格的结果。


消息来源：Ars Technica



老王点评：这应该是一位国内的开发者的工作，这种应用确实很有趣。]]></summary>

 The way you use it is you just describe what you want to do, like this: 
  cmdh 'Show system info.' cmdh 'Display CPU speed.' cmdh 'Monitor GPU temperature' cmdh 'Continously monitor all in-use socket connections.' 
 Then the command is displayed and you can run it like so:
 ``` gibler@gibler-MS-7D43:~$ cmdh 'Show available disk space' ✔ Retrieving command... Show available disk space desire command: df -h assistant message: To show available disk space, you can run the command "df -h". This will display the disk space usage in a human-readable format. ? Choose an option:
  
Run desire command (D) Quit (Q) ```
  
Pretty easy for a Linux newbie like me
 I've made it available publicly for anyone else who would like to use it. I personally have been using it every couple days when a random task comes up that I don't know how to do from the terminal so I'm sure others can get value out of it as well. You'll need to setup your OpenAI API key on the project. It gpt-4 by default so you may have to change that to gpt-3.5.

壮游的概念可以追溯到十六世纪中叶甚至更早，“Grand Tour”一词源于法语“le grand tour”，意思是“长时间的周游”。1561 年，伊丽莎白女王曾写信给佛罗伦萨大公科西摩·德·美第奇（Cosimo de’ Medici），希望他为横贯意大利旅行的赫德福德伯爵提供安全通行证。女王对伯爵“去发现众生及其城市习俗的伟大而值得称赞的想法”大加赞赏，并对其前往海外旅行的可贵决心加以鼓励。可见，伊丽莎白女王深知大陆旅行对年轻人和整个国家的益处，她还从大学中挑选出许多有才华的青年绅士，让他们为了公共利益到海外旅行，使之成为国家之栋梁。
1670 年，理查德·拉塞尔斯（Richard Lassels）出版了《意大利之旅》（The Voyage of Italy），书中首次使用了“le grand tour”这一术语，指英国人在法国、意大利和欧洲其他地区的旅行游学，随后该术语在英国成为普遍的概念。年轻的贵族子弟在国外游历两三年，接触古典文化，学习语言，增长见识，已经成为统治阶层精英教育必不可少的内容。同时，壮游活动很快就从英国扩展到欧洲北方其他国家，成批的青年贵族在私人教师与导游的陪同下经由法国来到意大利。
“经历了拿破仑时代的狂飙突进，当和平猝然降临、囚笼般的英伦岛国大门打开之际，每个向往漫游的英国人的最高愿望就是效仿几乎被遗忘的祖先们的习俗，将相当一部分的人生和金钱花费在马车中，穿梭于欧洲大陆和邮路之间。”在十八世纪这个旅行的黄金时代，女性也加入了壮游的行列。《壮游中的女性旅行者》以壮游中的女性旅行者为主角，讲述了1757至1854年间十六位杰出女性的旅行故事。这些女性旅行者中有走在时代思想前列的女权觉醒者，如海丝特·皮奥…]]></summary>

Arch Linux 提供滚动更新模型、强大的 pacman 软件包管理器，以及通过其软件仓库提供的成千上万的应用程序。它非常受欢迎，因为它允许你以 DIY 的方式创建定制的 Linux 发行版。它的优点之一是各种社区驱动的发行版，它们提供了预配置的设置和视觉上令人愉悦的界面。

本文将介绍其中一些，这些发行版的主要着眼点是它们的外观设计。

美观的 Arch Linux 发行版

让我们探索一些顶级美观的 Arch Linux 发行版，它们将美学与 Arch Linux 的核心功能相结合：

XeroLinux

XeroLinux 提供了一个视觉上惊艳的界面和流畅的设计。它预配置了 KDE Plasma 桌面环境，提供了一个整洁的工作区。这个发行版基于 Arch Linux，主要面向那些喜欢带有最新软件包和 KDE Plasma 的视觉效果的桌面环境，但又不想重新配置 Plasma 桌面环境的用户。XeroLinux 主要使用预配置的 Latte Dock 和 Kvantum 来为桌面环境带来独特的外观。



默认情况下，它使用 Catppuccin 主题，这是一个开源主题，旨在成为高对比度和低对比度主题之间的中间地带。Catppuccin 主题为 KDE Plasma 桌面环境提供了四种舒缓的温暖调色板，适用于各种用途，例如编码、休闲浏览或学习。

Plasma 桌面环境使用以下默认组件进行配置：


应用程序样式：Lightly

Plasma 样式：Scratchy

图标：Tela circle drakula dark

光标：Catppuccin mocha dark

窗口装饰：Lightly…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[这个开源工具可以轻松将 Markdown 转换为网页。


将 Markdown 文件直接变成网页，还无需搭建网站和生成过程，写完文档即可直接发布，你对这个内容感兴趣吗？你是否希望将 Markdown 或 HTML 自由地嵌入到多个平台（如内容管理系统或学习管理系统）中？由 Docsify.js 构建的开源项目 Docsify-This 提供了一种简单的方法来发布、分享和复用 Markdown 文件内容。

Docsify-This 是什么？

使用 Docsify-This，你可以立即将任何 Markdown 文件转换为响应式的独立网页。你还可以将多个 Markdown 文件链接起来，以创建一个简单的网站。网页设计师可以简单地通过点击 Web 页面生成器界面或改变网页的地址参数（即 URL），来更改所显示页面的视觉外观。在创建自己的 Markdown 文件内容时，你还可以使用一组提供的 Markdown CSS 类。此外，如果你使用 Codeberg 或 GitHub 仓库存储 Markdown 文件的话，每个页面都会自动提供一个 “编辑此页面Edit this Page” 的链接，以支持协同创作。

并且 Docsify-This 是开源的，因此你可以使用自定义域名托管 Docsify-This 实例，而不会有被平台锁定的风险。

使用 Docsify-This 网页生成器

要使用网页生成器，请先打开浏览器，导航到 Docsify-This 网站 或你在本地的实例。在 “网页生成器Web Page Builder” 部分，输入 Codeberg 或 GitHub 上公共存储仓库中的一个 Markdown 文件的 URL（其他 Git 主机可以通过 Docsify-This URL 参数进行使用，但不能在网页生成器中使用），然后点击 “发布为独立网页Pub…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey HN! We're building Seam (https://www.seam.co), a universal API for controlling IoT devices such as smart locks, thermostats, sensors, and (soon) cameras. Our hope is to make device integration simple, with a Plaid-like UI flow for obtaining device authorization and standardized API/SDKs for device control.
We started Seam out of our frustration with the challenges of integrating IoT devices with software apps.
For example, my co-founder Dawn led Sonder's efforts to integrate smartlocks with their reservation systems in order to automate access for guests. She struggled with poorly documented and unreliable device APIs along the way. Our founding engineer Max authored the popular TuyAPI library and has spent countless hours trying to build sensible interfaces on top of unreliable device…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[美国发射了一颗供黑客们攻击的卫星

周日，美国政府资助的一颗名为 Moonlighter 的卫星搭乘 SpaceX 的火箭发射成功。接下来，在大约两个月内，五支 DEF CON 黑客团队将尽力在卫星处于太空时成功地远程渗透并劫持它，其目的是在实际的在轨硬件和软件上尝试进攻和防御技术和方法。Moonlighter 被称为 “世界上第一个也是唯一一个太空黑客沙盒”，它是一个中型的 3U 立方体卫星，质量约为 5 公斤。对 Moonlighter 的第一次测试将于 8 月进行，第一名将获得 5 万美元奖金。


消息来源：The Register



老王点评：看来美国是真准备打太空战了。不过太空上有那么多目标，未必需要就在这个沙盒里面练手。




Stack Overflow 允许 AI 生成的内容，版主们罢工抗议

编程问答社区 Stack Overflow 在去年 12 月宣布了 临时禁止 ChatGPT 生成的内容。但上个月底它调整了AI 政策，“立即停止对人工智能生成的内容发布的暂停令，并停止仅以此为由对人工智能生成的内容进行审核”。此举招致了负责审核的版主们的抗议，他们认为人工智能会生成不精确的内容，这会对平台及其内容的完整性和可信度构成威胁。版主们宣布从 6 月 5 日起在 Stack Overflow 无限期罢工，目前已经约有 10% 的版主参与到这一行动中来。Stack Overflow 社区副总裁表示，这次行动的主要原因是版主们和 Stack Overflow 对检测人工智能生成的内容的工具的看法不同，他说 “我们坚持我们的决定，请版主们停止使用以前的工具”。Stack Overflow 和版主们都承认，该工具的误报率惊人。


消息来源：VICE



老王点评：本质上，你是无法防范人工智能生成的内容的，尤其是有一个不靠谱的检测工具的时候，更容易把事情搞得一团糟。与其这样，不如将分辨是否是人工智能生成的内容的精力放在认真审核上。




苹果发布其头戴式设备 Vision Pro

苹果宣布了它的第一款增强现实/混合显示头戴式设备 Vision Pro，起售价为 $3,499 美元，明年初将在美国开售。在发布后，由于其高昂的价格，苹果股价一度大幅跳水。苹果将 Vision Pro 称为“空间计算设备”，其操作系统是 visionOS，搭载全新的 3D 界面、全新的输入系统，可通过眼睛、双手和语音控制。Vision Pro 带有两个邮票大小的显示器，配置了 M2 芯片，有 12 个相机、5 个传感器和 6 个麦克风。当有人靠近正配戴 Vision Pro 的使用者时，设备的视区会变透明，双方可以互相看到，对方可以看到佩戴者的眼睛。


消息来源：苹果



老王点评：除了贵是最大的毛病外，我觉得苹果这个头戴式设备看起来似乎不错。]]></summary>

🧑🏻🏭 线上有直播，为什么我推荐你来线下参加？

三年疫情，大家似乎已经习惯了远程办公，习惯了线上沟通，淡忘了线下活动的感受。

全神贯注地听分享吧！当你习惯性预约直播之后，真的会去收看吗？当你坐在屏幕前听分享时，能保证不被周围的环境影响，全神贯注么？

和专家面对面交流吧！公开的分享会因为这样或那样的原因，隐藏一些不便提及的信息。而面对面的私下交流，往往能让人敞开心扉。

结识更多同行朋友吧！“千里难寻是朋友，朋友多了路好走”，在职场上朋友多了工作也发展更好。对于开发者，不管是结识同技术方向的朋友，还是创业、投资的朋友，都有助于长期的发展。

感受一下热闹现场吧！在规整的办公室格子里，感受不到“异界”的活力，在稀土开发者大会的现场，有各种好玩的展位和互动游戏，还有 3 只可爱的掘金 IP 在等你来！

最后，说一句肺腑之言：越是行情不好，越是要多出来走走。低头走路久了，也要抬头看看路！

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[压力测试 CPU 是检查处理器在重负载下性能表现以及系统在此情况下的温度的最佳方法之一。


当你压力测试 CPU 时，可以监视系统资源，观察它们在最高工作负载下的表现。虽然性能不会改变，但如果处理器不具备良好散热能力，温度可能会影响其运作。

对于发烧友来说，压力测试是建造新系统时必不可少的，特别是如果你打算以后超频 CPU。

例如，在压力测试过程中，如果你的 CPU 很快变得太热，你需要通过更换 CPU 风扇、使用更好的通风机箱等方式来改进散热解决方案。

现在你已经了解到压力测试的好处，接下来我将为你介绍在 Linux 中压力测试 CPU 的以下两种方法：


使用 GtkStressTesting（图形界面方式）

使用 stress 和 s-tui 实用程序（命令行方式）


接下来，让我们从第一种方法开始。

使用图形界面方法压力测试 Linux CPU 🖥️

如果你更喜欢使用图形界面方法，而不是通过终端操作，我有一个最简单的方法来帮助你进行系统压力测试。

有一个名为 GtkStressTesting 的图形界面实用工具，可以帮助你进行压力测试和同时监视温度。它提供了多种预设来进行系统压力测试，并提供了选择在测试期间需要使用多少个内核的功能。


🚧 该工具在 GitLab 上已不再积极维护。但是它仍能按预期工作。


GtkStressTesting 可以作为 Flatpak 安装，因此如果你尚未启用 Flatpak 支持，请参考我们的 Flatpak 安装指南。

一旦你启用了 Flatpak 支持，可以通过终端（如果没有软件中心）使用以下命令来安装 GtkStressTesting 实用工具：

flatpak install flathub com.leinardi.gst


安装完成后，你可以从系统…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[《编结茅香：来自印第安文明的古老智慧与植物的启迪》，[美]罗宾·沃尔·基默尔著，侯畅译 ，商务印书馆2023年1月出版，516页，88.00元

应该怎样评价美国学者罗宾·沃尔·基默尔（Robin Wall Kimmerer）的非虚构著作《编结茅香：来自印第安文明的古老智慧与植物的启迪》（Braiding Sweetgrass: Indigenous Wisdom, Scientific Knowledge, and the Teachings of Plants）呢？这当然能够算是一部科普读物。作者在书中写下了她与植物打交道的经历，还从科学的角度介绍了植物和植物学的历史。而书名里提到的“茅香”，是一种分布在亚欧大陆北部与北美洲的禾本科植物，有着一种特殊的香气。整本书以茅香为题，分为五个部分，从种植“茅香”开始，随后依次是“照料”“采摘”“编织”和“焚烧茅香”。
除此之外，书中描述的植物还包括南瓜黄花、山核桃（碧根果）乃至藻类。在一次清理老旧农场的池塘时，作者告诉读者，“这滴水看上去就像是罐子里的浮渣一样，而它却包含了这么多的生命”。在显微镜下，刚毛藻的长丝像缎带一样闪着光，而团藻则像闪着虹彩的风滚草一样。这些藻类存在的意义，就是成为食物链上的一环。只不过，对意图为自己的女儿们收拾出一个“可以游泳的池塘”的作者来说，这并不是什么好事。因为“最适合游泳的湖泊不是富营养化的，而是冰冷、清澈、贫营养的，也就是说水里没有什么营养物质”。
不过，仅凭这些，倒也很难想象这本书曾经斩获纽约时报畅销书、华盛顿邮报畅销书和洛杉矶时报畅销书排行榜的畅销书奖项。实际上，作者在书中描述了许多个人经历。譬如，在1975年进入大学学习植物学的一开始，“我的第一门专业课堪称一场灾难……我实在提不起热情来背诵植物必需营养元素的浓度”。但是到了后来，“没有人提到过紫苑和一枝黄花的伙伴关系，但我可以像背诗一样…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[咖啡跟侦探推理小说真是再适配不过了。特别是欧美和日本的作品里，咖啡无处不在，侦探，警察，嫌疑人，被害人，谁都得来上一杯。加奶油的，带着厚重感；纯黑的，则像罪案一样带点邪气，如彼时流行的俗谚：“黑得像地狱，浓得像死亡，甜蜜如爱情。”读者自然不能免俗：咖啡馆里就着一杯卡布奇诺，读一本阿加莎的《无人生还》，此乃现代“打工人”美好的“小确幸”是也。

但您可能没想过：这侦探文学的标配饮料，还跟启蒙主义思潮关系密切。
咖啡文化虽然发源于非洲、盛行于阿拉伯，却是在十七世纪的欧洲，如意大利、英国和法国真正推广起来，并迅速影响了这些国家的文化生态。在此之前，欧洲人的主要消闲处是酒馆，环境阴暗，酒醉人迷，很难引发什么理性思考；而咖啡令人清醒、专注，咖啡馆温暖、明亮、平价，对理性的逻辑思维展开有所助益，是十七世纪以后的欧洲人最喜欢的公共社交空间。
正是咖啡馆这类新型公共空间的产生，为人类进入现代民主时代提供了舞台。它的廉价——点上一杯便宜咖啡，可以坐上一整天——打破了原有的阶级隔阂，让贵族和平民可以平等交谈、辩论；在邮局、证券交易所、报社等现代设施普及之前，它还兼任所有这些场所集散信息的功能。十八十九世纪的大革命得以酝酿，与咖啡文化也不无关系——马克思和恩格斯就常常相约于摄政咖啡馆。

如果说，咖啡馆是资本主义现代城市的理性文化地标，那么，咖啡馆里的侦探推理小说，则串连了启蒙主义思潮悄然影响大众的历史链条。
等一等，咖啡也就算了，侦探推理小说怎么也和启蒙主义思潮攀上关系了呢？
侦探推理小说的核心，在于“谜题-解答结构”。此结构的奥秘，除了万事一定要有答案之外，还有中间那道杠，即：谜团是怎么解开的？要靠逻辑推理。而逻辑推理的思维前提是什么？是理性。理性意味着思维的相续展开，在事物之间发现或建立因果联系。
看上去没什么特别？我们逆推一下：用理性…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Right now I am using a traditional distro with core, community and third party packages. I am increasingly more and more interested in immutable distros. I tried NixOS in past and I have switched back to a traditional distro because I did not have time to learn about the new operative model and because NixOS was on the verge of switching to flakes, a different framework for building and installing packages.
 As a Emacs user, I am also interested in Guix, because it is a Lisp variant, but I have not tried it yet. I have only briefly dabbled in Fedora Silverblue one or two years ago, but I dropped it because it was difficult to install interception tools, for remapping keyboard keys.
 Long story short, I have tried some of the immutable systems and I get it that having a rollback is a great feature.
 What I do not understand is the discourse of enhanced security.
 For starters, it is true that every package installed as a root has root access to your machine. But I do not see how installing flatpaks solves that security issue. While I appreciate that in an immutable system you get a read only /usr partition, shouldn't the focus be on protecting the /home instead? The security issue is about the data, so if we make the /usr readable but still install third party software with normal user privileges, how did we protect our data and our privacy?
 I mean, what added security does the immutable system brings to the table if I still have to trust the flatpak provider?
 Don't get me wrong, it is great to have this separation between the apps and the core system, but I do not get the whole security discourse.
 It seems to me that we have just placed our trust elsewhere, from third party repo packagers, to flatpak packagers. But the issue of the security is still unsolved.
 Please help me to understand. Am I missing a piece of the puzzle in the whole picture?

 Wanted to share a little gem I've recently discovered that's been making my life as a developer so much easier. Say hello to the GitKraken Client - a tool that's redefining the way I work with Git. And here's the kicker: it's been a dream to use on WSL 2!
 Now, I'm sure most of you are no strangers to WSL 2 (Windows Subsystem for Linux 2) - it's that fantastic feature that lets us run our beloved Linux on Windows. It uses a real Linux kernel inside a managed VM, and it's super powerful. The cherry on top? WSLg, which makes Linux GUI applications feel like they're right at home on Windows.
 Let me spill the beans on why GitKraken Client has got me so hyped:

It Plays Nice with WSL 2: It works like a charm with repos stored on your WSL 2 file system. And there are…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Apart from the obvious, which is that a lot of software doesn't run natively on linux, over the years I've found some "details" that can very easily turn into deal breakers depending on the context. 
 For example in my case, I can't get fractional scaling to work on my laptop running Archcraft, and I can't seem to find any distro that does it well (even tried KDE and other QT based envs). It's one of those features that you take for granted when you come from an OS like windows and that doesn't even cross your mind until you actually have to use it.

We automate infrastructure, security, integrations, and more, helping developers ship faster while also automating a lot of repetitive tasks for devops and platform teams. Here’s a demo: https://www.loom.com/share/95265177704346c7b379e981978cd8c5.
It's expensive, time-consuming, and technically difficult to build a secure, scalable Kubernetes platform. Yet many companies that do this spend 6+ months building it themselves and then hire an expensive platform team to manage it. We've talked to customers who have spent $1.5M to build something that isn't their core product.

 End of this month, I'm going to start the Linux Administration Master Course, free of charge and live on the internet. Many people have already signed up, and I would love to see many more do so. Come and join a great bunch of folk!

Memory-Management and BPF Summit, Luis Chamberlain led a plenary

assumptions in the current kernel that the block size used by a block-layer
device is less than or equal to the system's page size—both are usually 4KB
today.  But there have been efforts over the years to remove that
restriction; that work may be heading toward fruition, in part because of

quickly encounter file descriptors, which are used to represent open files
and more.  Developers also tend to learn early on that the first three file
descriptors are special, with file descriptor zero being the standard input
stream, one being standard output, and two being standard error.  The
kernel, though, does not normally attach any specific meaning to a given
descriptor number, so it was somewhat surprising when a recent BPF patch
series attempted to attach a special meaning to zero when used as a file
descriptor.]]></summary>
