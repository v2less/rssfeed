        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am on EndevaourOS + KDE Plasma. I'd like to use the power profile slider in the battery plasmoid to manage the energy consumption/performace of my (amd) laptop in combo with the recent amd-pstate drivers.
 I read on the documentation of power-profile-deamon, that it should support the AMD P-State scaling driver, but it says that it will use it only if ALL these three conditions apply
  
platform_profile driver isn't available for the system
 the CPU supports Collaborative Processor Performance Control (CPPC), and
 the AMD P-State scaling driver is in active mode.
  
I am ok with point 2 (I have Ryzen 7 7735HS) and point 3 (I added the kernel parameter amd_pstate=active and now /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu0/cpufreq/scaling_driver contains amd-pstate-epp)
 How do I fix point 1 and tell it to use the pstate driver?
 ​
 Apparently I have this platform_profile driver available and working. Indeed
 >> powerprofilesctl list performance: Driver: platform_profile Degraded: no * balanced: Driver: platform_profile power-saver: Driver: platform_profile 
 doesn't show the pstate driver
 ​
 EDIT: It was also pointed out here

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I really like the command-line tool abcde for ripping CDs. It's in most of the major distro software repos. But I noticed that the latest version, v2.9.3, was released in 2019.
 The Github repo here 
 https://github.com/glanois/abcde
 has seen somewhat more recent development, including a fairly important bugfix for an issue that causes abcde to fail on single-track CDs with the default settings:
 https://github.com/glanois/abcde/pull/4
 However, this repo is set up as a simple mirror of the (apparently canonical) repository at:
 https://git.einval.com/git/abcde.git
 But this is just a link to a git repo with nothing to browse. Poking around on the einval.com site, I can see some recent blog updates from a guy who appears to be the author of abcde, but no mention of abcde itself, which leads me to think it may be abandonware.
 Anyone know what's up?

We know life can be busy. And we often struggle to make time for the people that matter most to us.
According to a Harvard study from 2021, "36% of all Americans [...] feel “serious loneliness.”" [1]
We created an app to help people focus on their most personal relationships and guide them through forming more meaningful connections with them, in the hopes to combat the "Loneliness Epidemic".
We just launched the first iteration - call it an MVP if you like - something to validate our ideas and get the conversation started.
We are looking for people to try out what we have built and share their thoughts. The functionality is very basic for now, but we are planning to expand based on our users' feedback.
Here is what you can do today:
* Tell us who the people are that matter most to you
* Get daily reminders to reach out to them
* Send them virtual postcards with over 50 handcrafted designs

        <id>https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37624400</id>
        <link href="https://github.com/rdaum/moor"/>
        <updated>2023-09-23T15:56:48.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I got my start on the Internet in the very early 90s playing with, authoring in, and programming on LambdaMOO (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LambdaMOO) and similar systems. Shared virtual social spaces, with a persistent object oriented authoring / scripting language. They can be classified as MUDs (depending on who you talk to) but the focus is social, creative / authoring, and shared programming not RPG gaming.
I've always wanted to see this kind of thing modernized and further developed. Over the last 25 years or so I've worked on similar but novel & improved things, but never finished.
So I decided to just re-implement LambdaMOO and use that as a base, instead and keep compatibility as a goal, but build it out on a more modern foundation that takes advantage of multiple core machines, newer network protocols, newer connectivity methods, uses MVCC transactions for the shared database etc.
LambdaMOO is a somewhat extensive system in that it is composed of compiler, a virtual machine, an object database, user permissions system, network runtime. In some ways it's kind of like a shared, text-based Smalltalk image/runtime... So quite a bit to implement and get right before it all works together.
The big challenge throughout has been slavishly maintaining backwards compatibility so existing "cores" (databases) work.
It's not done, but it's darn close. Would like for people who are into this kind of thing to check it out, and maybe even help.
Many of the technical aspects here are still provisional, but this is the start. Constructive assistance welcome.
(Yes, it's a rewrite in Rust, but that's not really the point, even though that's a cliche that's fun.)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Wayland Color Management protocol has been years in the making and is needed for a client to specify the color space and HDR metadata of a surface. This color management protocol is ultimately needed for getting high dynamic range (HDR) support working out well within Wayland environments. This week an initial merge request was opened for implementing the draft color management protocol with the Weston reference compositor. 
 The Wayland color management protocol has been years in the making and the current work-in-progress protocol for staging can be found via this open merge request, which itself is three years old. 
 New this week is developer Leandro Ribeiro posting a Weston merge request for implementing a majority of the color management protocol spec. The lone missing piece is image_description_creator_params_v1 support, which will be followed up in a future merge request. 
 Those interested in tracking the Weston color management support can see this Weston merge request now under review. 
 Slowly but surely the Linux desktop is getting ready for finally offering good high dynamic range (HDR) support.

You may say BSD? Do you really think the crap BSD license would ever make that happen. And what about other Free Software that you run on your computer? I can confidently say, 80% of the Free Software you use would not exist today without GNU Project, GPL and FSF. 
 You guys tryna find out 100s of wrong arguments to defend calling your OS as Linux. For what? To hand over all the credits to a guy who stole the credits that GNU Project had been working for since 1980s?
 You argue that we can't call our system GNU/Linux/systemd/xorg/... That's fine but why special exception for the linux kernel? Afterall GNU were the one who set out to create the operating system. Atleast GNU isn't named on it's founder unlike your kernel.
 You argue Alpine isn't GNU. But you forget GNU/kBSD or GNU/Hurd isn't Linux.
 All your arguments for not mentioning GNU are already answered here
 Why don't I see people defending GNU instead. Why to defend that organization whose own employees do not care about freedom and were caught using Mac. 
 You say GNU is a cult. But you forget none of these would be possible without those so-called Free Software extremists. 
 If you have to be biased, why not be biased for GNU, for the sake of freedom. Instead of arguing about alternatives to coreutils and glibc why not use those and improve them to keep GNU and it's ideas alive.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[本文将详细介绍如何在 Ubuntu 和其他 Linux 发行版中转换和查看 WebP 图像，主题内容涵盖了你所需知道的全部信息。

WebP 图像格式的定义

2010 年 9 月，谷歌提出了 WebP 图像格式，其愿景是完全替代 JPEG、PNG 和 GIF 文件格式。就如你所见，WebP 是一个全能型的格式，继承了先前压缩算法的所有特性，支持有损和无损的动画以及透明度。

除此以外，WebP 基于块预测技术，它是互联网上推荐使用的图像格式。由于其文件大小明显更小、图象质量更好，WebP 已经成为了为网站提供图像的现代化标准。

现状简述

现在，几乎所有的主流 Web 浏览器都开始支持 WebP，也就是说你可以在包括 Chromium、Chrome、Firefox、Brave、Vivaldi、Safari 和 Edge 在内的热门浏览器中查看这种格式的图像。

然而，要从现有的 JPG 和 PNG 文件创建 WebP 图像，你需要安装谷歌开发的 WebP 库。另外，Linux 发行版的文件管理器暂时还不能直接显示该格式的图像。

为了与 WebP 实现无缝集成和提供良好的用户体验，各个组件必须协同工作。操作系统需要的是 WebP 的核心库。此外，文件管理器和图像查看器则需要能识别 *.webp 文件类型并进行加载。

这些为用户提供了一致的体验。由于 WebP 是新的标准，正在广泛施行和应用，你可能需要在 Linux 下执行一些额外的步骤以便运用这种技术。

另一方面，Windows 10 和 11 现在已经默认支持 WebP，包括其新的图像查看器功能。

因此，本篇文章将探讨如何在 Linux 系统下浏览、创建以及转换 WebP 图像的问题。

如何查看 WebP 图像

VSCodium 是微软 VS Code 的“完全开源版本”。

它基本上是 VS Code 的克隆，并去除了所有遥测痕迹。遥测是用于收集有关应用使用情况的数据。许多开发人员使用它来深入了解改进他们的应用。

从外观和功能来看，这两个编辑器是相同的。



在 Ubuntu 上安装 VSCodium 有三种方法：


从发布页面下载 deb 文件进行安装。缺点是你无法轻松更新它，因为你必须再次下载新的 deb 文件。

将第三方开发者仓库添加到你的系统中（VSCodium 推荐的方式）。这样，你还可以获得 VSCodium 新版本的定期更新。

使用 snap 版本。如果你不厌恶 Snap 软件包，这也许是最简单的方法。


我不会讨论第一种方法，因为它只是从 发布页面 下载并 安装 deb 文件。

我们来看看另外两种方法。

方法 1：通过添加外部仓库来安装 VSCodium

VSCodium 官方文档引用了 Pavlo Rudy 的 GitLab 仓库，它为你提供了 VSCodium 的持续更新版本。


📋 虽然我在这里使用 Ubuntu，但这些步骤应该适用于 Debian 和其他基于 Debian 和 Ubuntu 的发行版。


以下是步骤。

在 Ubuntu 中打开终端 并使用以下命令获取开发者的 GPG 签名密钥并将其添加到你的系统中。这样，你的 Ubuntu 系统将信任该开发人员签名的软件包。

老王点评：虽然不乏吹嘘成分，但是只有这种切实使用并改善 Linux 的商业产品和服务，并回馈给社区的企业，对 Linux 和开源的贡献才是实实在在的。

DuckDuckGo CEO 说摆脱谷歌“需要很多步”

DuckDuckGo 是一家以隐私为中心的搜索引擎，成立于 2008 年，其创始人在对谷歌的反垄断审查中表示，由于谷歌是电脑上的默认选项，消费者从谷歌转向其他搜索引擎“比想象中要难得多，……需要很多步”，因此 DuckDuckGo 的市场份额一直很小。DuckDuckGo 目前在美国搜索市场的份额约为 2.5%，每天的全球搜索量约为 1 亿次。相比之下，谷歌每天的搜索量为几十亿次。

 I've been using Linux based systems for quite a while now, but I want to get into the technical stuff of how it works internally. Not necessarily aiming to be kernel dev, but I just want to know how low level stuff works under the hood.
 Some colleagues suggested to read Linux Kernel Development by Robert Love, however it seems like it's based on kernel version 2.6, and I'm a bit skeptical about this.
 Do you think that the book is still relevant today ? I suppose the fundamentals haven't changed but it won't be the most up to date read about the kernel.
 I know I could just go ham on the kernel documentation but I'm lacking knowledge that I hope this book might provide me.

1959年首次出版的《马克斯·韦伯与德国政治1890-1920》（下文将简称《韦伯与德国政治》）是韦伯研究领域公认的经典之作。鉴于钱永祥、阎克文两位前辈已为本书增添了两篇重量级导读，其中对韦伯的政治思想以及一战前后德国政治生态提纲挈领的把握，读来令人受益匪浅。也许是出于职业习惯，我对本书的关注更着眼于作者沃尔夫冈·J.蒙森对韦伯政治观点的历史考察。作为历史学家，蒙森似乎始终坚持并强调从时代出发理解韦伯的立场，他在自己编纂的韦伯全集第十五卷的导言中写道，韦伯“终其一生深度介入政治”，也“从未摆脱过日常政治对其所提出的要求”。一方面，韦伯深度介入政治的年代适逢德国政治出现重大转变并引发后续系列影响；但另一方面，青年蒙森辗转求学并以韦伯政治思想为题撰写博士论文的上世纪四五十年代，德国又进入一个新的转折时期：二战后同盟国对战败德国采取非纳粹化和民主化改造，尤其强调在西占区（及日后的联邦德国）思想领域通过推行“再教育”以西式民主思想重塑德国社会。职业与生活的经历显然影响了蒙森对韦伯的理解，并最终参与形塑了本书的主要观点。也正是文本所呈现的观念与这种特定时代氛围、作者所处的知识分子代际之间的互动，让这次阅读之旅变得高度紧张，但同时又充满趣味。
一、沃尔夫冈·J.蒙森其人
沃尔夫冈·J.蒙森的曾祖父是德国著名的古典学家、历史学家，著有《罗马史》的特奥多尔·蒙森（Theodor Mommsen），父亲威廉·蒙森（Wilhelm Mommsen）是魏玛共和国杰出的政治史学者。他的孪生兄弟汉斯·蒙森（Hans Mommsen）则是当代著名的第三帝国史学者。虽然家学渊源深厚，沃尔夫冈·蒙森却一度想要放弃延续父祖辈的事业。不过经历了在大学修读物理和数学未…]]></summary>

Ive heard somewhere that the kernel was originally called freax or something, they could just change it back to that or just change it to something else as id imagine renaming the kernel, which isnt really what most people refer to when they say the word linux, would go way smoother.. Then gnu would just remain as is, the kernel would be named whatever is decided, and linux would finally just be solidified as the name of the combination of the gnu components with the "insert new name" kernel here. I can see why some think this is dumb, and i, to some extent, agree, but i also value credit being given appropriately, especially as an rms fan lol. Edit: i forgot to aknowledge the fact that many of us already refer to our os of choice as the name of the distro rather than linux, but it could make things less intimidating or confusing for outsiders, consider the remarkable number of distros available

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[First, I'm not a Ubuntu hater. It's not my favorite distro, but I respect it and I actually enjoy using it from time to time. As for snaps, I don't care about it being implemented to Ubuntu and I'm actually curious to see how it will turn out in the long run. And obviously, when I mention distros, I am not talking about Ubuntu flavors (Kubuntu, Lubuntu, etc...) which obviously should follow Ubuntu's direction.
 Ubuntu are making big changes recently, and they've made it clear that it's only a matter of time before their entire system is snap based. On the other hand, Ubuntu-based distros such as Pop!_OS, elementary OS and such are clearly more headed towards Flatpak and would have no use of snaps to their core system. Not to mention Linux Mint that is openly unfriendly towards snaps. As lo…]]></summary>

        <updated>2023-09-22T16:36:12.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Overall, a “Device Tree” is a mechanism for describing non-discoverable hardware. In the past this type of information was hard-coded as part of the source code (and later part of the binary/firmware). So we can say a “DeviceTree” is a data structure for describing hardware. By the way, there is a specification for that called “The Devicetree Specification” (https://www.devicetree.org/specifications/).
 Moreover, “DeviceTree” allows the kernel to manage different components such as CPU, memory, buses and other. The specification detailed above contains the data format used, which is internally a tree of named nodes and properties (key-value based). Device trees can be in binary format (“*.dtb”) or text based (“*.dts”) for easing the management and editing (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Devicetree). The “*.dtb” files are loaded by the bootloader and passed to the kernel — as shown in the diagram below.
 Thus, we can find in the Linux kernel source code “*.dts” files in the directories of some of the architectures, with the following pattern “/arch/[ARCHITECTURE/boot/dts”. Two examples are “arm64” (https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v6.5.4/source/arch/arm64/boot/dts) and “nios2” (https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v6.5.4/source/arch/nios2/boot/dts). In order to transform “*.dts” files to “*.tdb” we can use the “dtc” which is the “Device Tree Compiler” (https://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/xenial/man1/dtc.1.html). We can go over Makefiles responsible for that if we want (like https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v6.5.4/source/arch/arm64/boot/dts/Makefile).
 Lastly, there are also “.dtsi” files that include files (like we have in c/c++). We can use also YAML as the format of “*.dts” files in order to describe the different hardware components (https://www.konsulko.com/yaml-and-device-tree).

Really excited to share what I've been working on. Rapidpages is a prompt-first online IDE, think midjourney for front-end developers. I've been working on this for a while and it's great to see some interest from companies like Vercel in this space.
All you need for self-hosting is an OpenAI key and a GitHub oauth app. Simply clone the repo and play with it. It's also available on the cloud at www.rapidpages.io
Please give it a try and let me know if you have any feedback, and if you like what I'm doing with Rapidpages, please give it a star on GitHub.
Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[我们将介绍几款可在 Linux 系统中使用的白板应用程序。我相信，这些信息对你将大有帮助。请继续阅读！


一般而言，数字白板是一种大型互动显示面板的工具。比如：平板、大屏手机、触控笔记本和表面显示设备等，就是一些常见的白板设备类型。

假设教师使用了白板，你就可以使用触控笔、手写笔、手指甚至鼠标在设备屏幕上进行绘画、书写或操作元素。这意味着，你可以在白板上进行拖动、点击、删除和绘画，就如同用笔在纸上一样。

但是，要做到这一切，就需要一款软件来支持这些功能，即实现触控和显示之间的精细协调。

现在的市面上，有很多商业应用都能完成这项工作。然而，在这篇文章中，我们将会重点介绍一些自由且开源的、并且可在 Linux 系统中运行的白板应用程序。

Linux 系统白板应用程序佳选

1、Xournal++

在我们的推荐名单上，第一个就是 Xournal++。我认为，这是此列表中最好的应用程序。它十分稳定，而且已经存在了一段时间。

Xournal++ 允许你进行书写、绘画，以及其他常见的在纸上进行的各种事情。它支持手写、自定义荧光笔、橡皮擦等工具。此外，它还有其他诸多功能，例如：支持图层，支持添加外部图像，支持添加音频，具有多页特性等。

该应用程序兼容几乎所有的压敏输入设备，例如 Wacom、Huion 和 XP-Pen。我曾在触摸板笔记本上进行过测试，经过少量设置修改后，它就可以正常工作了。因此，你可以开始使用任何你手头上的触控设备。

Xournal++ 是使用 C++ 和 GTK3 进行编写的。



对于 Linux 系统，你可以按下述步骤进行安装。此程序是完全免费的，且适用于 Linux、macOS 和 Windows 系统。如果你想在移动设备上尝试，也提供了 BETA 版本。

安装步骤：

该应用程序可以通过 AppImage、S…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[使用 Tagger 来标记你的音乐？ 现在，它增加了新功能和修复。


Tagger 已发布新版本，其中包含大量有用的改进！

对于那些不知道的人来说，Tagger 是一款专注于流行音乐文件类型的开源 标签编辑器应用，支持 MP3、OGG、FLAC、WAV 等音乐文件。

它可用于向音乐文件添加重要的元数据，例如专辑封面、艺术家/发行商信息、发行年份，甚至自定义属性。

让我们看看这个新版本的 Tagger 能提供什么。

🆕 Tagger V2023.9.1：有什么新变化？



Tagger 采用 C# 语言编写，它出现自 2021 年底，并且一直在定期进行改进。

在 Tagger V2023.9.1 版本中添加了多项改进。

首先，它包括了更新的翻译，要感谢 Weblate 上的用户。

然后还有新添加的功能，可以在 Tagger 中打开、管理和创建播放列表。这是为了更容易地同时处理许多音乐文件，从而“音乐文件夹Music Folder”现在被称为“音乐库Music Library”。

接下来，同步歌词时间戳现在以 “mm:ss.xx” 格式显示，遵循 LRC 规范，并且可以指定 “hh:mm:ss” 和 “mm:ss.xx” 格式，允许 Tagger 对其进行转换。

此外，Tagger 现在在排序时在音乐文件列表中显示标题，为了获得更有条理的文件视图，主窗口大小在应用重新启动时不会丢失，并且 LRC 文件现在可以正确导入。

有关更多技术细节，你可以参考其 发行说明。

📥 下载Tagger V2023.9.1

你可以通过选择可用的软件包之一来获取最新版本的 Tagger，如下所示：


Snap

Flatpak

AUR 包


对于 Ubuntu，你还可以运行以下命令来安装它：

sudo snap install tagger



💡 当我们谈论添加元数据的应用时，还有 元数据清理器。它允许你清除最流行的文件类型中的元数据，这与 Tagger 完全相反。


💬 你以前用过 Tagger 吗？ 你对此的体验如何？ 在评论区分享你的观点。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sometime ago I posted in this subreddit my rofi-desktop project, a collection of rofi menus made by simple bash and python scripts with the aim of providing the features of a complete desktop environment. 
 Since then, many things were added or changed, and I feel like it's time for an update. 
 - First of all, almost all the scripts are now fully commented and easily customizable by sourcing environment variables. Check the config.env file for a commented list of customizable stuff. Uncomment variables inside as needed and source the file somewhere in your ~/.bashrc file to customize your rofi-desktop.
 - The main script rofi-desktop.sh now supports an optional argument that can be provided to determine which entries to show in the menu, like this:

work toward the creation of user-space spinlocks using adaptive

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[OpenAI 宣布 DALL-E 3，让提示工程过时

OpenAI 发布了 DALL-E 3，其可以与 ChatGPT 完全集成在一起。从提供的样本来看，DALL-E 3 在图像合成方面的能力似乎比现有的任何其他模型都要强，能更有效地完善手部等小细节。它可以将 ChatGPT 作为头脑风暴伙伴对图像进行会话完善，在 “无需魔改或提示工程” 的情况下默认创建引人入胜的图像。也就是说，你无需像对 MidJourney 那样输入一些反直觉的提示词，而 ChatGPT 会很好的理解你意图，并生成符合意图的图像。


消息来源：Ars Technica



老王点评：想起了国内某过气的技术大佬曾经说 10 年后全世界有 50% 的工作会是提示工程。这话颇像当年他们嘲笑云计算就是新瓶装旧酒一样。




谷歌用 “iPager” 广告嘲讽苹果

长期以来，谷歌一直试图公开向苹果施压，迫使其采用 RCS（富通信服务）消息协议，但苹果的库克回应是，消费者“应该给他们的妈妈买一部 iPhone”。谷歌最近发布了一则尖刻的广告，这则名为 “iPager” 的广告模仿了苹果的营销语言，展示了一个复古风格的传呼机（BP 机），表明苹果选择的信息平台已经落后于时代。广告称，iPager 使用 “过时的短信技术” 来 “与安卓手机发短信”，并列举了在与安卓手机通信时坚持使用短信技术的许多明显缺点。实际上，有 30 年历史的短信技术确实可以追溯到老式的传呼机。


消息来源：Engadget



老王点评：用传呼机收短信，这是个好主意~ 😉




苹果和谷歌不完全披露的 libwebp 漏洞造成大麻烦

两周前，苹果公司报告称，威胁者正在积极利用 iOS 系统中的一个零点击漏洞来安装间谍软件。几天后，谷歌报告了其 Chrome 浏览器中的一个 WebP 堆缓存区溢出漏洞，并且该漏洞已经被利用。这两个漏洞的相似之处，让安全研究人员认为它们极有可能源自同一个漏洞，特别是 libwebp，它是应用程序、操作系统和其他代码库用于处理 WebP 图像的代码库。由于这两个漏洞是单独披露的，拥有不同的 CVE，并没有追溯到根源，很有可能数百万个使用了 libwebp 的应用程序都存在该漏洞。这包括各种 Linux 操作系统、各种浏览器、各种使用 Electron 框架的的应用。


消息来源：Ars Technica



老王点评：难道报告漏洞也要各扫门前雪了么？

说到世界上最著名的女性知识分子，很多人都会想到法国哲学家西蒙·德·波伏瓦。她的名著《第二性》中有这样一句名言：“女人不是天生的，而是养成的。”（On ne naît pas femme, on le deviant.）除此之外，她也撰写了关于哲学、政治和社会议题的小说、散文、传记、自传等，曾获颁1954年龚古尔文学奖、1975年耶路撒冷奖和1978年奥地利国家欧洲文学奖。她与法国哲学家让-保罗·萨特保持了一段终身的开放式关系，也被传为佳话。
波伏瓦1908年生于巴黎，有一个比自己小两岁的妹妹。她们的母亲是一位出身于银行家族的虔诚教徒，而律师父亲一直希望有一个儿子。父亲鼓励波伏瓦像男人一样思考，也希望她成为作家，能够经济独立。由于外祖父投资失败，家道中落，家庭关系恶化，这对她的成长有很大影响。波伏瓦青年时代写的《一个规矩女孩的回忆》（上海译文出版社今年出了中译本）里这样描写父母对自己职业生涯的影响：“我父亲的个人主义与异教徒的道德标准，与我母亲所教导的严格的道德常规主义形成了鲜明的对比。这种失衡使我的生活陷入无休止的争论中，这是我成为知识分子的主要原因。”

波伏娃著《一个规矩女孩的回忆》

家庭经济困境使她无法依靠嫁妆吸引结婚对象，这使得波伏瓦决定要自力更生。十七岁时，波伏瓦完成中学会考，进入巴黎天主教大学修读数学。取得数学和哲学专业的学士学位后，她进入位于巴黎郊区的圣玛丽学院修读文学和语言，并于入学第一年就得到了索邦大学的一系列证书，于第二年开始学习哲学，并于十九岁时获得哲学证书。二十岁时，波伏瓦取得哲学文科学士学位，并在索邦大学的文学院…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[GNOME 桌面的最新版本已经发布。


我们见证了 GNOME 的不断演化，每次重大更新都会带来新的功能及改进。

在上一个版本中，GNOME 44 推出了许多酷炫的特性，如今，GNOME 45 也紧跟其后，推出许多有益的优化。

下面让我们一探究竟。

GNOME 45：有何新变化？




尽管我们已经单独详述过 GNOME 45 的亮点特性，我还是简洁回顾一下这次发布的所有相关详情。


系统设置的调整

新的工作空间指示器

新的或者更新的核心应用程序的引入

Nautilus 的用户界面优化



GNOME 45 引入激动人心的更新


新的工作空间指示器



根据我们 之前的报道，GNOME 45 让 “活动Activities” 按钮走向了历史。

如今，我们已经有了一个药丸状的动态指示器，能明了当前处于活动状态的工作空间，以及工作空间的数量。

这是一个微小但整齐的设计改动！

系统设置的调整



在 GNOME 45 中，设置应用下方出现了全新的 “隐私Privacy” 子菜单，现在各类选项展示得更有序。

“关于About” 子菜单也被优化，现已通过 “系统详细信息System Details” 菜单显示技术数据。除此之外，线上账户设置也在可用性上得到了提升。

引入了新的核心应用



GNOME 45 版本告别了 “GNOME 之眼Eye of GNOME” 图片查看器，转而采用 “放大镜Loupe” 应用，并摒弃了 “茄子Cheese” 相机应用，全新引入了 “快照Snapshot” 应用。

原有的核心应用也得到了更新。

就 “地图Maps” 应用而言，出现了一些微小变动，如缩放按钮的调整以及侧边栏的重塑。

同样地， “天气Weather” 应用的默认窗口大小被扩大，以便为所有温度计部件提供空间。

别忘了，“计算器Calculator” 应用现已支持更多种类的货币，以及 “连接Connections” 应用 可以在 RDP 连接中复制 / 粘贴文本、图片和文件。

🎨 Nautilus 的用户界面优化



Nautilus 文件管理器已 做了一些轻微的界面优化，新的左侧边栏汉堡菜单使得侧边栏看起来比以前更醒目。

🛠️ 其他改动与优化

除了我们述及的重点，下面还有一些其他值得注意的变化；


文档扫描应用已迁移到 GTK4。

数个应用新增了视觉效果并改进了自适应表现。

在快速设置中新增了一个控制键盘背光的切换。

在 Shell 中新增了一个指示器，用于显示相机何时在活动状态。


如果你感兴趣，可参阅官方 发布公告 了解更多详情。

如何开始使用 GNOME 45

你可期待 GNOME 45 将在 Fedora 39 及 Ubuntu 23.10 上首次亮相。

在那之前，你可以通过在 GNOME OS 上使用 Boxes 或在你的 Arch 发行版上手动安装（当它在仓库中可用时）来尝试 GNOME 45。

请注意，GNOME OS 的主要目的是用于测试。

💬 对于这次发布，你有何看法？是否还有其他期待？

你有一个 立付Live Linux USB 吗？在当前系统上测试它的常用方法是重新启动，并在系统重新启动时选择从立付 USB 启动。

但这很烦人，因为你需要停止计算机上的工作并重新启动它。

一种干扰较小的方法是使用虚拟机。

是的，你可以使用 VirtualBox 从虚拟机中的 USB 启动。这样，你不必为了尝试而在 VM 中安装发行版，而是改用立付会话。

在本教程中，我将展示在 Linux 系统使用 VirtualBox 从 USB 驱动器启动的步骤。这需要花费一些时间和精力，但可以让你免于重启系统。

在 Linux 的 VirtualBox 中从 USB 驱动器启动

由于这是针对高级用户的教程，因此我省略了你事先需要的几个步骤：


在 Linux 系统上 安装 VirtualBox

创建立付 Linux USB，最好 使用 Ventoy


本指南分为三个部分：


创建虚拟机磁盘文件

在 VM 中使用 USB 启动

删除虚拟机磁盘（可选）


那么让我们从第一个开始。

步骤 1：创建虚拟机磁盘文件（VMDK）

首先，你需要识别 USB 驱动器的磁盘名称，为此，你需要 列出系统的驱动器。

为此，我将使用 lsblk 命令：

lsblk





🚧 确保使用不带任何数字的磁盘名称。就我而言，Ventoy 以 sdb1 命名，但我仍然只能使用 sdb。


从上图中，你可以看到，Ventoy 列出了 sdb11，但你必须使用不带任何数字的名称。这意味着我必须只使用 sdb，否则，它会抛出错误。

找到驱动器名称后，使用以下命令中的 VBoxManage 命令来创建：

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Block Caribou extension is a 21-line extension that does one thing and one thing only: it disables GNOME's on-screen keyboard (also known as Caribou for some reason).
 Now, I'm sure you're thinking "that sounds stupid" or "GNOME has an on-screen keyboard?".
 The thing is: - GNOME's on-screen keyboard can't be disabled without an extension. - And it automatically pop ups every time you tap a text field, regardless of whether you have a physical keyboard.
 And while I'm sure this behavior is great on tablets, I don't have a tablet (in fact Linux tablets barely exist). I have a laptop with a fully functional keyboard. As such, it's extremely annoying that anytime I tap a text field, a giant on-screen keyboard appears (taking up almost half my screen) that I just don't need.
 I understand that the on-screen keyboard not checking for a physical keyboard is probably a bug. And the GNOME team has a right to prioritize what bugs they focus on. Especially since touchscreen users are a minority.
 What I don't get is why after 6 years of this being a problem, there still isn't a way to just turn off the on-screen keyboard without a third-party extension!
 It's insane to me that if you want a usable touchscreen experience on GNOME, you need to use this one person's somewhat-hacky extension. Especially since it need to be updated for each new GNOME release. Heck, the extension's already been abandoned once, the version I linked to was a fork!
 Ultimately, it's nice the extension exists, it's what allows me to use my touchscreen on GNOME. But the ability to disable the on-screen keyboard shouldn't require an extension in the first place, especially since the on-screen keyboard has bugs still. Not to mention, that due to its third-part nature, the extension isn't perfect, notably it doesn't work on the lock screen.
 (And yes, I am aware that it's extremely unlikely that this post will amount to anything. Sometimes it's just nice to yell into the void.)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hia,
 for years I maintained a courier mail server and it was rock solid, but its initial setup was quite the steep learning curve and managing users was cumbersome. For a while now I have switched to modoboa, but having reinstalled it now for the third time I am souring on it.
 Now I am in the market for something else and I was wondering if one of you can point me towards a solution that has me manage users, logs, opendkim, dmarc and whatnot without breaking every ffing time I upgrade ubuntu. (I know, it's a vps, don't judge)
 I might also be in the market for a good reliable mail provider that allows my own domain and will not scan my mails, will not rug-pull the eula, supports open standards, will not suddenly disappear.
 thx. s

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[大模型“深吸一口气”后会更聪明

DeepMind 的研究人员开发了一种技术，可以通过使用人工智能模型来改进提示词，以提高其它人工智能语言模型的数学能力。利用这种被称作“通过提示进行优化（OPRO）”的技术，他们发现，使用“深吸一口气，一步步解决问题”的提示词，能大幅提升数学测试得分。对 PaLM 2 使用该提示，它在小学数学应用题数据集 GSM8K 中的正确率达到了 80.2%，而不使用该提示正确率只有 34%。为什么这能奏效呢？大模型显然不会呼吸，也不像人类那样思考和推理。它所做的“推理”都源自从书籍和互联网上抓取的短语数据集。这些内容中往往在“深呼吸”，“一步步思考”等短语后跟着更合理的推理方案。这些短语可能有助于大模型产生更好的答案。


消息来源：Ars Technica



老王点评：要想让人工智能像人类一样思考，就得把它当成人类一样对待。




亚马逊将为 Alexa 添加人工智能

亚马逊展示了由其全新的 Alexa 大语言模型驱动的全新 Alexa 语音助手。这款全新的 Alexa 可以理解对话短语并做出适当的回应，更有效地解释上下文，并通过一个命令完成多个请求。他们表示，Alexa LLM “是一个真正可通用的大型语言模型，针对 Alexa 的用例进行了优化；它与 Bard 或 ChatGPT 或任何这些东西都不同”。想参加测试的美国用户，可以对 Echo 设备 说“Alexa，我们聊聊吧”，就有可能被加到预览测试名单中。


消息来源：The Verge



老王点评：语音助手是最应该有人工智能的设备，而之前它们只是简单的问答机和搜索引擎而已。




统一加速基金会成立，英伟达缺席

Linux 基金会本周宣布成立统一加速（UXL）基金会。该组织的使命是提供 “一个开放标准的加速器编程模型，简化高性能、跨平台应用程序的开发”。该基金会的创始成员包括 Arm、富士通、谷歌云、英特尔、高通、三星等公司。但英伟达公司缺席，英伟达提供了自己的 CUDA 编程模型，用于使用其 GPU。这个新的基金会的核心是 oneAPI 计划的演进，其目的也是创建一个新的编程模型，使开发人员更容易支持各种加速器，无论它们是 GPU、FPGA 还是其他专用加速器。


消息来源：Tech Crunch



老王点评：那就看看自己玩还是大家玩，那个更好玩。

之前，由于不满 HashiCorp 修改 Terraform 的许可证，社区创建了 OpenTF 分支。在 HashiCorp 大为不满，向许多支持的公司发送了“停止侵权”的通告后，为了避免商标侵权，OpenTF 改名为 OpenTofu —— 开源豆腐。他们有意选择了一个幽默的名字。]]></summary>

在目前的旅游史研究中，女性视角受到的关注应该说还是很不够的。法国历史学家、旅游研究专家马克·布瓦耶（Marc Boyer，1926-2018）的《西方旅游史：16-21世纪》（HISTOIRE GENERALE DU TOURISME Du XVle au XXIe siecle，2005；金龙格等译，广西师范大学出版社，2022年）是一部完成于十几年前的专著，梳理了十六至二十一世纪五百多年间西方旅游活动随社会变革、习俗演进的发展过程，以及不同历史时期的旅游活动特点。布瓦耶通过对过去五百多年间西方历史上随文明和社会习俗演进的旅游活动进行系统梳理，重新发现旅行在人类探寻生命意义和自我价值中的独特魅力。然而遗憾的是，无论从研究视角还是叙事结构来看，布瓦耶并没有把女性在西方旅游史上的独特性和思想意义作为一个研究专题来论述。女性主义历史学家更会看出在男性权力的旅游史叙事与“壮游中的女性旅行者”之间，至今仍然存在不平等的差距。
但是反过来说，尽管进入二十一世纪以来的性别史、妇女史以及在各种历史研究议题中性别研究视角的研究成果已经非常丰富，关于旅游视角的女性主义论述却也仍是很少见的。例如在乔治·杜比（Georges Duby ）与主编的《女性史·20世纪卷》（A History of Women in the West， Volume V : Toward a Cultural Identity in the Twentieth Century，1992；袁袆、王璐莎译，浙江大学出版社，2023年）中，就没有旅游史上的女性这样的研究视角。在原书出版于2013年的大部头《史学理论手册》（The SAGE Handbook of Histo…]]></summary>

位于美国艾奥瓦州费耶特（Fayette）县的奥尔温（Oelwein）是一个人口不过几千人的寻常小镇。如果不是记者尼克·雷丁（Nick Reding）写了一本名为《美国小城镇的死与生》（Methland: The Death and Life of an American Small Town）的畅销书，许多人可能根本没有听说过这个地方。在2005年至2007年间，作者走遍美国小镇，研究甲基苯丙胺（俗称“冰毒”）滥用的影响和原因，用书中的话来说，就是“寻找冰毒对于美国小城镇的意义”。而他关注的焦点就是奥尔温。

奥尔温

在作者看来，奥尔温在“成千上万个散落在美国二十八个内陆州的低空飞行区的小社区”里，“无论从哪个方面来看都相当典型”。与其他地方一样，这个小镇也曾有过属于自己的“黄金时代”。在上世纪八十年代之前，拥有百年历史的芝加哥大西部铁路公司的发动机制造厂就设在奥尔温小镇的中央区域，另一家肉类加工厂的工作虽然危险而辛苦（工伤率达百分之三十六），但可以提供有竞争力的工资，让一个高中辍学的青年也养得起好几个孩子。这里的农业条件也很好，占地四百八十英亩的莱恩农场“由于百分之五十的耕地用以大豆轮作”，“每年基本上靠间作作物就可以实现保底收益，种植干草也只是为了饲养绵羊而已”。在农业与小企业的支撑下，奥尔温有教堂、银行、电影院、日用品商店和餐厅，以及医院、学校与“至少举办了两百年的圣诞盛会”……不过，需要指出的是，《一个美国小镇的死与生》并不是一本严格按照时间叙事的著作，对奥尔温历史的回顾穿插在全书的好几个章节里。不得不说，这对原本就不熟悉相关情况的中国读者而言，又平添了不少阅读理解上的困难。
在书中，尼克·雷丁提到，进入二十一世纪以后，“与奥尔温的经济和文化联系更紧密…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Rust 开发者，你们有新的东西可以尝试了！


在最近宣布基于 IntelliJ 的 IDE 将支持 Wayland 显示服务器 协议之后，JetBrains 推出了面向 Rust 开发人员的新 IDE。

它被称为 “RustRover”，目的成为一个功能丰富的独立 Rust IDE，并将接收定期更新、快速支持和“开箱即用的体验”。

请允许我向你展示它所提供的内容。


📋 这是一个早期使用工具，目前不适合生产使用。


RustRover：可以期待什么？




🚧 RustRover 不是自由开源软件。


RustRover 从头开始开发，取代了现已弃用的 IntelliJ Rust 插件，该插件用于提供 JetBrains 平台上的 Rust 支持。

它是根据 JetBrains 的其他 IDE 构建的，用于提供专用的 Rust 开发环境，而这是以前所缺少的。


💡 RustRover 还使用 IntelliJ Rust 插件作为组成部分。


在当前状态下，RustRover 支持诸如 Rust 、 Cargo 、 TOML 、 web 和数据库等语言和技术。具有来自 IntelliJ IDEA 的附加功能，包括 VCS 集成。

而且，说到它的功能，还不少呢！ 🗒️

对于编码，它支持代码补全、代码生成、智能重构、实时模板等。RustRover 旨在帮助用户更快、更准确地编写代码。

它还具有一些基本功能，例如语法高亮显示、宏扩展、跨语言操作等，以帮助更好地理解代码库。

对于测试，RustRover 具有测试运行器、调试器、对运行配置、运行目标、分析和性能分析的支持。

对于项目管理，它支持 Cargo 和 Cargo.toml、构建脚本、依赖项声明中的代码补全，并且可以轻松访问 Crate 文档。

RustRover 还具有一些简洁的实时协作功能，例如支持 VCS（Git 和 GitHub）、配置共享 和 code with me。

你可能想知道它的许可和定价模式怎么样？

鉴于 RustRover 不是开源的，JetBrains 计划将其作为商业产品以订阅方式出售，与其他 IDE 产品类似。

定价结构尚未最终确定，但预计会与他们的 IDE 产品定价类似。

你可以通过他们的公告博客来了解更多关于 RustRover 的信息。


📋 既然我们正在讨论 Rust 的话题，为什么不尝试一下我们的 Rust 基础系列呢？它应该作为 Rust 世界的一个很好的介绍。


想要试一试么？

RustRover 已提供 tar.gz 包、JetBrains Toolbox App 和 ** Ubuntu Snap 包** 提供。你可以从 官方网站 获取你选择的包。


RustRover


 

对于 Ubuntu，你还可以运行以下命令：

sudo snap install jetbrains rustrover --classic


请注意，在撰写本文时，Snap 包未按预期运行，在使用上述命令时在安装过程中引发错误。

JetBrains 计划在 2024 年 9 月之前对 RustRover 保持公共预览版，并在此之前发布稳定版本。

I have noticed slight differences in using these distributions. With Debian, I have to apt install curl, sudo and other basic utilities. Ubuntu I don’t. I install portainer and pihole on both OSs and got an error when doing it on Ubuntu since port 54 was already occupied. I pretty easily got around this by stopping that service and repointing one of the configs but I found that interesting. What are the advantages/disadvantages of the differences in Ubuntu/Debian?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[从文字描述上看，它对用户产生的影响将如何呢？你有何看法呢？


欧洲开源峰会Open Source Summit Europe 刚刚开幕，我们开始看到围绕 Linux 和开源软件的一些有趣动态。

其中一项新闻是关于未来将如何处理 Linux 内核的 长期支持（LTS）版本。

我们来看一下即将进行的更迭。

新变化： 在峰会上，Linux 开发者和 LWN 执行编辑 Jonathan Corbett 宣布，Linux 内核的 LTS 周期即将从原先的六年缩短至两年！

目前，有 六个 LTS 版本的 Linux 内核，即 4.14、4.19、5.4、5.10、5.15 和 6.1。

在将来，继 4.14 之后，当 LTS 状态的下两个版本被淘汰时，它们将不会被其他内核版本所取代。


📋 你可以查阅 Linux 内核归档 来了解目前 LTS 版本 Linux 内核预计的终止支持日期。

4.14

2024 年 1 月



时机选择：Jonathan 提到的理由之一是，并不是很多人使用旧版本的 Linux 内核，因此这些版本没必要继续进行维护。

我对此表示同意。然而，肯定有些人对此举动感到不满。

但是，这个决策的推进主要是由于 Linux 代码维护人员过度劳累的大问题。

你看，对于一个 LTS 版本的代码进行检查和改善是一项重任务，需要消耗大量的时间和精力，而问题就出在这里。

据 Jonathan 所说，维护人员面临的 两个大挑战 分别是：大部分 维护人员并未得到酬劳以维护 Linux 内核，以及采用 “Fuzzing” 技术寻找问题，虽然有所帮助，但有时也可能揭示出许多小问题，需要维护人员花费更多的精力。

看到这样的情况，维护人员容易感到疲劳，对吧？🙁

当被问及 维护人员如何得到帮助？ 时，Jonathan 建议他们与雇主进行沟通，把 Linux 内核维护工作转为付费工作。

他还补充说，


如果公司希望继续从 Linux 中获益，就需要意识到他们必须向 Linux 回馈。


总的来说，此次变革将减轻维护人员的负担，但依赖于旧版本 Linux 内核的系统可能会承受不获得关键更新的风险。

这可能会对大部分用户产生影响，或可能不会，但对某些组织来说，可能会带来些许不便。

💬 你怎么看？在下方评论区分享你的想法吧。

I would like to look it up on the wayback machine, but i just can't remember the name.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi folks. I launched my first startup on HN 15 years ago (see my profile), and I wanted to post here again now.
Like my last one, this project comes from one of my life's passions. I have played Magic: The Gathering for 30 years.
My co-founders and I think Magic deserves its own market, and this thinking will lead to dozens of ways to make a great app. We consider what we have an MVP, and we are all going to MagicCon this weekend in Las Vegas to walk around in our Mana Pool shirts and talk to people about the future.
If HN likes the site, I would appreciate you crashing it before we head out tomorrow night!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[“ramfs” is a filesystem that exports the Linux caching mechanism (page cache/dentry cache) as a dynamically resizable RAM based filesystem. The data is saved in RAM only and there is no backing store for it (https://docs.kernel.org/filesystems/ramfs-rootfs-initramfs.html)
 Thus, if we unmount a “ramfs” mounting point every file which is stored there is lost — as shown in the screenshot below. By the way, the trick is that files written to “ramfs” allocate dentries and page cache as usual, but because they are not written they are never marked as being available for freeing (https://lwn.net/Articles/157676/).
 Moreover, with “ramfs” we can keep on writing until we fill-up the entire physical memory. Due to that, it is recommended that only root users will be able to write to a mounting point which is based on “ramfs”. The differences between “ramfs” and “tmpfs” is that “tmpfs” is limited in size and can also be swapped (https://wiki.debian.org/ramfs).
 Lastly, we can go over the implementation of “ramfs” as part of Linux’s kernel source code (https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v6.5.3/source/fs/ramfs). There are two implementations, one in case of an MMU (https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v6.5.3/source/fs/ramfs/file-mmu.c) and one in case there is no MMU (https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v6.5.3/source/fs/ramfs/file-nommu.c). A good example for using “ramfs” is “initramfs” (which I am going to elaborate on in a future writeup).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The "limited" C API for CPython extensions has been around for well over a
decade at this point, but it has not seen much uptake.  It is meant to give
extensions an API that will allow binaries built with it to be used for
multiple versions of CPython, because those binaries will only access the stable
ABI that will not change when CPython does.  Victor Stinner has been
working on better 
definition for the 
API; as part of that work, he suggested that some of the C extensions in the
standard  
library start using it in an effort for CPython to "eat its
own dog food".  The resulting discussion showed that there is still a fair
amount of confusion about this API—and the thrust of Stinner's overall plan.]]></summary>

Booklet updates classic internet forums and email groups to have a modern UI and high polish. It organizes communications into threads, and summarizes activities into a neat email newsletter - so members can stay updated without having to stay logged in. The async format promotes deeper discussions, while also increasing engagement by making conversations easy to follow.
My goal is to make communications more asynchronous - so that I can get back to work, instead of slacking all day. Most early communities have been hobby groups, but my goal is to mature Booklet into a tool that sits alongside Slack in companies.
Try it out, and let me know what you think!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[这是一款以隐私保护为重点，能在各平台上运行的记事本应用。一起来了解一下吧！


你是否正在寻找一款以隐私保护为核心的记事本应用？

那么，我们可能为你找到了合适的东西！

Beaver Notes 是一个跨平台的开源记事本应用，它将笔记数据存储本地，从而避免了数据泄露的风险，并允许用户在离线时访问已存储的笔记。

我认为它很快就可以登上我们的 最佳 Linux 记事本应用 列表了。

以下我将带你了解这款应用，同时我也会分享我的初步印象。

Beaver Notes：概况 ⭐



Beaver Notes 使用了 Vue 和 JavaScript 构建，作为一款以隐私为主导的记事本应用，它提供了简洁而直观的用户界面。

它有许多让人赞赏的功能，使它成为一款理想的记事应用。一些突出的特点包括：


专注模式

笔记标签系统

Markdown 编辑支持

导出/导入笔记的功能


推荐阅读：

初步使用体验 👨‍💻

我在我的 Ubuntu 22.04 系统上安装了 Beaver Notes，并且添加了一些随机的笔记以及它自带的两份介绍笔记。

当我打开 Beaver Notes 时，我首先看到的是其主页，上面展示了各种信息。其中包括一个整齐地组织了的我的笔记的区块，以及它旁边的配有笔记分类功能的搜索菜单。

此外还有一个侧边栏菜单，其中列出了创建/编辑新笔记、浏览所有/归档笔记、切换深色模式和设置菜单等重要选项。



随后，我尝试了下 笔记编辑体验。

如前所述，Beaver Notes 支持 Markdown 格式，而且我发现使用它编辑非常直观，而且它拥有我期待中的所有常用选项。




Linux 上 11 个最好的 Markdown 编辑器


值得注意的是，它有一个 “专注模式Focus Mode”。启用后，所有的菜单元素都被隐藏起来，让我可以全屏进行更专注的编辑。


📋 尽管该特性带我进入了全屏模式，但我为了能够以下面的截图，还是选择了退出全屏模式。




另外一个吸引我眼球的功能是 “标题树Headings Tree” 特性。这使得在大型的，由多个标题组成的笔记中轻松导航成为可能。



Beaver Notes 还有一个 笔记标签系统，这让你更有效地管理你的笔记。只需要输入 # 和标签名，即可创建新的标签。

之后，你可以通过搜索栏邻近的标签排序菜单，或点击主页上的标签进行排序。



你还可以 归档笔记。我可以将笔记归档而不是删除它，并以后在侧边栏中的 “归档Archive” 选项中查看。



那如何改变它的外观配置呢？

“设置Settings” 菜单中包含了常规的选项，允许你在浅色模式、深色模式和系统模式之间切换。

在这里还可以对数据导出设置密码，同时也能导入笔记。



最后，还有 “快捷键Shortcuts” 菜单，这里列出了在 Beaver Notes 中可用的所有键盘快捷键。



在我短暂的使用体验中，Beaver Notes 给我留下了深刻的印象，尤其针对不需要进行云同步的情况，这是一个非常理想的记事本应用。

我建议你也试试看，它提供了许多有价值的功能。

📥 下载 Beaver Notes

由于 Beaver Notes 是 一款跨平台应用，因此它可以在 Linux、Windows 和 macOS 上运行。你可以在 官方网站 下载你需要的安装包。

如果你对源码感兴趣，也可以访问它的 GitHub 仓库 查看。

I am pretty ruthless removing distractions from my life (e.g. no Instagram, Facebook, TikTok), but some tools I'd like to keep using some parts of it. E.g. Twitter/X, I dislike the feed but I like reading some threads that are shared here or on blog posts. Same for YouTube, I enjoy some videos but I do not want recommendations when I finish the video I was watching.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi HN, James, Valter, Sam and the team from ElectricSQL here.
We're really excited to be sharing ElectricSQL with you today. It's an open source, local-first sync layer that can be used to build reactive, realtime, offline-capable apps directly on Postgres with two way active-active sync to SQLite (including with WASM in the browser).
Electric comprises a sync layer (built with Elixir) placed in front of your Postgres database and a type safe client that allows you to bidirectionally sync data from your Postgres to local SQLite databases. This sync is CRDT-based, resilient to conflicting edits from multiple nodes at the same time, and works after being offline for extended periods.
Some good links to get started:
- website: https://electric-sql.com
- docs: https://electric-sql.com/docs
- code: https://github.com/electric-sql/electric
- introducing post: https://electric-sql.com/blog/2023/09/20/introducing-electri...
You can also see some demo applications:
- Linear clone: https://linear-lite.electric-sql.com
- Realtime demo: https://electric-sql.com/docs/intro/multi-user
- Conflict-free offline: https://electric-sql.com/docs/intro/offline
The Electric team actually includes two of the inventors of CRDTs, Marc Shapiro and Nuno Preguiça, and a number of their collaborators who've pioneered a lot of tech underpinning local-first software. We are privileged to be building on their research and delighted to be surfacing so much work in a product you can now try out.

据报告，二季度有 30 多万台 H100 GPU 进入了服务器制造商的装配线，按每台 GPU 连同散热器的重量约为 3 千克，约计 900 吨！此外，为人工智能处理工作配备 8 个 GPU 的服务器推高了服务器平均价格，涨幅超过了 30%。据预测，8 个 GPU 的服务器的持续部署将导致服务器市场收入在 2024 年上半年同比增长 51%，预计将有一百万个 H100 GPU 进入服务器。

老王点评：我从来不知道芯片也可以按吨来计算，这一比喻令人直观地感受到现在 GPU 芯片有多火。




MariaDB 公司或被风投收购

MariaDB 公司于 2022 年 12 月进行了首次公开募股（IPO），获得了 1.04 亿美元的资金。今年 3 月，MariaDB 公司表示，预计通过数据库订阅和服务筹集的资金将不足以满足其预计的营运资金和运营需求，“正在寻求额外的资金，以满足 2023 年 9 月 30 日之后的预计营运资金、运营和债务偿还需求”。7 月，纽约证券交易所通知 MariaDB，该公司在 30 天内股价跌破 1 美元，不符合其上市手册的规定，面临退市风险。风险投资公司 Runa Capital 提出收购 MariaDB 已发行普通股的 100% 的非承诺要约。

老王点评：开源软件公司不好干啊，可能不上市还更好一些。




AI 编程助手有时候会替你填上别人的密钥

不小心的开发人员可能会在代码库中硬编码证书，甚至提交到 GitHub 等公共源代码托管服务。研究人员对 GitHub Copilot 和亚马逊 CodeWhisper 等 AI 编程助手生成的代码中是否会出现泄露的 API 密钥进行了研究。他们让 AI 补完代码中空白的密钥值，研究发现，这些 AI 编程助手给出的密钥中，Copilot 有 3.6%，CodeWhisperer 有 5.4% 都是 GitHub 上的有效硬编码凭据。


消息来源：The Register



老王点评：也就是说你泄露的密钥，不仅仅能在 GitHub 上搜到，而且会被 AI 编程助手告诉别人。]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[《体面人生》，黄昱宁著，江苏凤凰文艺出版社丨读客文化，2023年9月版，49.90元

这是一个时代渐行渐远的结尾？或是另一个时代貌似平静的开端？因为身处其中，我们很难看清。也许要有一个视角，滤去太多太杂乱的景观；或者时间之流中一个制高点，向前、向后都能看得更远些。黄昱宁可能恰好拥有那样一个视角：这个时代（假如真有这么个东西）开始之初，人们只会在懵懂中到处乱撞时，她仍是对世事似懂非懂的少女，就像《阿B》故事的叙述者，管亦心。她看见很多时代现象，却并不真能了解其含义。这既给她带来（并将终身伴随）对某一类人、某一类事物的神秘感受，又让她能免于为那些时代现象付出某种精神上的代价——每一次撞墙都会造成巨大损伤。并且在一切都过去、一切都面目全非之后，能让她拥有比较恰当的记忆，既不会虚妄地夸大，也不会轻视甚至完全无视。
中短篇小说集《体面人生》确实也找到了一些小小的制高点——或者我们也可以称之为观景台，就像你驾车盘山正略感迷失，偶尔就会在路边看到它们，凸向峡谷的峭壁上，简单铺着几条枕木。你站到上面不仅能看到来路去路，有时候你还能看到美丽的冰川和潟湖。这些故事中的一些场景、人物以及正在或将要影响他们命运的若干日常事件，确实起到了观景台的作用，驻足其中，你便能“体面”地观察到一些东西。
《十三不靠》中在“碧云天”饭局上的人们，他们和小说作者恰好在一条时间裂缝的两边——跨过这条裂缝，事物的意义变得有所不同。就像我们先前所说的，小说作者和管亦心们有幸避过了这条时间/意义的裂缝，对事物得以保持一种恰当的、相对健全的看法。而碧云天饭局中人却经历了断裂，他们中及时跟上的人得到时代红利，稍有迟疑或者执着的人们，不免就要忍受某些支离破碎的生活感受。前者拥有双重的自满，后者则有虚妄的自矜和自持。
而管亦心们也有她们的问题。在《离心力》的故事里，她把自己的老屋租给外卖骑手，自己又去租住别人“贴着内环带地暖有…]]></summary>

六十年前，丹尼尔·布尔斯廷（Daniel Boorstin）在《幻象》（The Image, 1962）一书中试图通过“我的个人经历：我看到的广告牌、我读过的报纸杂志、我听过的广播节目、我看过的电视节目、我看过的电影、我每天收到的邮寄广告、我在店里见过的商品、对着我讲过的销售话术、我听过的对话、我在身边感觉到的种种渴望”，总结美国的当代生活，使之变得通俗易懂。他十分坦诚地承认，“20世纪美国所具有的倾向和弱点，也是我自己身上的”。因此，《幻象》如他所说，旨在为新的美国荒野描绘一份粗略的地图，而所有的美国同胞都为此提供了一手资料。最终的要旨在于：“美国人日常经历中鸡毛蒜皮的小事，回答了我们生活中最重要的问题，那就是，我们所相信的真实是什么？”
在眼下这个信息如洪流呼啸而来的时代，读者或许会怀疑六十年的岁月是否黯淡了布尔斯廷观察的光泽。事实上，《幻象》中蕴含的真知灼见是如此精辟，以至于我们触目所见的风景似乎都是布尔斯廷式的（历史学家史蒂芬·惠特菲尔德语）。当年他所追踪的刚刚冒头的、令人恼火的现象如今像浮油一样持续在美国场景中蔓延，并早已越出美国的水域而造成更大面积的“污染”，因此我们似乎不得不对此加以新的说明：居伊·德波（Guy Debord）提出了“景观社会”（society of the spectacle），让·鲍德里亚（Jean Baudrillard）提出了“拟像与仿真”（simulacra and simulation），翁贝托·艾柯（Umberto Eco）提出了“超现实”（hyperreality），更不必说进入互联网时代之后，人们遭遇无处不在的“后真相”（post-truth）和“假新闻”（fake news）。

两年前，当 Sauce Labs 在 开源项目办公室Open Source Program Office（OSPP）开设实习岗位时，我参加了它的面试。当时竞争十分激烈，而我并不具备一个技术公司青睐的技术背景。彼时的我正忙于从艺术领域寻求一个出路，参加了一系列技术课程，努力学习 Python 和 JavaScript 等技能。我下定决心要把握住这次可以在开源领域工作的面试机会，因为这是我踏上新的职业道路的入口。

在 柏林的 PyLadies 社区中，我认识了 Eli Flores，她和我亦师亦友，也正是她最终内推了我。如果不是因为 Eli，我可能根本不会有机会在 Sauce Labs 参加面试。

但我的简历真的很差。

我试图为自己包装一些我没有的技术能力，努力猜测面试官希望看到的内容。当然，面试筛选的过程也很困难。必须有人从成堆的简历中挑选出专业技能对口、适应工作角色的投递者，同时期待着有能够为团队带来新理念的创新人才。一方面，公司提供了一个面试的机会，对自己信任的人的判断有信心；另一方面，这也会使大家有很多的相似之处。

这正是内推计划的妙处所在，也是我在技术领域赢得 第一份工作的故事。

但是，为别人内推就足够了吗？很多帮助他人内推的人认为自己已经完成这一年的“善事”，但 Eli 并不这样想。

Eli 是 Sauce Labs 在德国雇佣的第一位女性软件工程师。当我来到公司时，一共有三位女性员工：Eli，我自己以及 Elizabeth —— 她是在一年前入职的一位初级工程师。基于 Eli 自己的奋力历程，她关注了我的发展，邀请我参加定期的工作检查，同时根据公司的考察体系，为我提供了很多关于如何制定职业规划的有实际意义的信息。Eli 从不会只是甩给我一个链接然后离开，她会耐心…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[gamescope: the micro-compositor formerly known as steamcompmgr essentially runs your game inside a window while not letting the game know it is inside a window. 
 https://github.com/ValveSoftware/gamescope
 For me, there have already been a few games that this fixes a lot of headache:
  
Dragon Age Inquisition window resolution doesn't change the actual size of the window. I can manually resize the window, but that doesn't resize what the game engine sees so my mouse cursor is in a different position in-game than what it shows on screen. With gamescope, the game thinks it is running fullscreen at the resolution I want and there are no problems.
 
The Outer Worlds has a similar problem. The window does match the size I want it to be at, but the resolution that I want to play at for some reason keeps resizing the window to be smaller than I want. The same as with DA:I, I can tell it to run fullscreen and gamescope turns it into a window.
 
Undertale has basically no settings, it runs in a window or fullscreen. With gamescope, you can tell the game it is running fullscreen and gamescope puts it in a window at whatever resolution you want.
 
Fanmade pokemon games using RPGMaker have weird window options like S, M, L, Full screen. You can just set it to full screen and put it in a window like the others.
 
 So, gamescope has been very useful for me. There are packages included in many distro's official repos, with a status list at the bottom of the github page, but are usually not installed by default with steam. Once installed, all you have to do is put the appropriate gamescope options into the steam launch arguments.
 This is especially useful for me because I have an ultrawide monitor and like to run games in a window in the middle with browsers open on each side for youtube or guides.
 I know this might be an extremely niche issue, but I wanted to document if there's another 5 people on the planet that really needed a solution like this.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The main reason for the maintenance overhead and maintainer burnout factor has been bugging for some time now. Finding a new maintainer is a hell of a challenge as Jonathan Corbett, Linux kernel developer and executive editor of LWN pointed out at OSSUMMIT . 
 Also mentioned is that there is no dearth of developers who flock into the system to contribute to every new release.
 He also mentions that , there is no point in maintaining the kernel people are not using anymore. Well, many maintainers are not paid to maintain. The culprit is the maintainer prime headache is the bug found fuzzer. It is not that the fuzzer is bad, then it is finding way too many small stuff that maintainers have to go through and ultimately discard. So , it gobbles up a lot of invaluable time too.

 Last year I tried asked this question at lot of places and couldn't find any solution. This includes posts on unix.stackexchange and askubuntu. It turns out that none of the RDP clients could communicate to Microsoft authenticator.
 Today I tried it again, after almost 1.5 years. And I am glad to share that I can finally connect to uni's PC.
 These PCs have a lot of proprietary that I used for engineering simulation. Here is a nice snip. Finally I can access these softwares from my home. A lot of thanks to the devs of Remmina.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Fedora 39 即将热门登场！在你进行安装前，先在这里了解一下新的功能。


Fedora 38 的升级引人瞩目，带来了全新的定制版，同时可以无限制地访问 Flathub。

如今，我们再次迎来升级，也就是 Fedora 39。

如果一切按计划进行，Fedora 39 将在 2023 年 10 月 17 日 正式发布。然而，这次有何新奇特性呢？

一起来探索一下！



Fedora 39：重要亮点

在 Fedora 39 中，你能期待一些值得关注的更新和变化，以及其他一些内容。

其主要改进包括：


GNOME 45

Fedora Onyx 定制版

彩色 Bash 提示符

应用程序更新

性能优化


彩色 Bash 提示符



Bash 提示符有了微小修改，改变了默认配色。

过往的单色默认配色与长命令的输出在视觉上容易混淆，现在，这种区分就容易多了。

当然，你也可以根据个人喜好，随意更改提示符的颜色。

GNOME 45

GNOME 45 是本次升级的一大亮点。

与 Ubuntu 23.10 一样，Fedora 39 也将是首批搭载 GNOME 45 的发行版之一。

GNOME 45 带来了大量实用的改动，以及一些微妙的视觉整改。

一些关键亮点包括：


新增的核心应用

系统设置新增的“关于About”面板

系统设置中的隐私中心

对 Nautilus 文件管理器的改善


对文件管理器的性能优化应会带来显著提升。

重新设计的简洁的侧边栏使得文件与文件夹区域的区分比以往更为明显。



引入的核心应用，如 “放大镜图像查看器Loupe Image Viewer” 和 “快照Snapshot”，应当大有用处。这是一个简单且极简的图片查看器，以及一款网络摄像头应用。然…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[SaaS 公司退云节省了 100 万美元

SaaS 项目管理公司 37 Signals 的 CTO 此前表示，他的公司每年在云计算上花费 320 万美元，其中大部分花在 AWS 上。由于高昂的云服务费用，该公司推动了云遣返计划，花费了 60 万美元购买了 8 台大型服务器，每台服务器包含 256 个虚拟 CPU，并将它们托管。该公司 CTO 称，“我们的云计算支出已经下降了 60%，从每月约 18 万美元降至不到 8 万美元。”他补充说：“按年增长率计算，这相当于节省了 100 万美元，而且我们将在 9 月份再次大幅降低成本。”此外，该公司的运维团队的规模在此期间保持不变。

老王点评：云计算并不仅仅是节省成本的。




英伟达显卡的开源 Nouveau 驱动维护者辞职

Nouveau 刚刚发布了一个大型补丁系列，使 Nouveau 内核驱动程序能够使用英伟达的 GSP 来改进对 RTX 20/30 系列硬件的支持，并最终在 RTX 40 GPU 上实现加速图形支持。几个小时之后，它的核心维护者辞职了。长期以来，红帽公司的 Ben Skeggs 一直是 Nouveau DRM 内核驱动程序的主要维护者，在很大程度上一直领导着 Nouveau 内核驱动程序部分。他发布消息称，“我已经辞去了在红帽的职务，并将退出 Nouveau 开发”。


消息来源：Phoronix



老王点评：虽然红帽在努力地封闭 RHEL 源代码，并且说了一些不中听的话。但无论如何，红帽养活了很多开源开发者，一旦他们离开了红帽，其贡献也很有可能就戛然而止。




微软发布了 WSL 2 的 2.0.0 版本

这是 Windows Subsystem for Linux 的一次重大更新，以 WSL v2.0.0 的形式发布在 GitHub 上。不要把它与 WSL 2 混淆，它实际上是 WSL 2 的 2.0.0 版（上一个版本是 1.3.17）。这个版本有许多更新，WSL 软件包中的所有二进制文件现在都已正确签名，WSL 内核已针对 Linux 5.15.123 进行了更新，WSLg 1.0.57 捆绑了最新的图形/用户界面支持。此外，还包括一些实验性功能，比如，可以减少 WSL 虚拟机回收缓存内存时的内存使用、可以改变 DNS 请求的解析方式、可以将 Windows 的防火墙规则应用到 WSL、自动使用 Windows 的网络代理信息等。


消息来源：Phoronix



老王点评：微软真是不遗余力地将 Linux 中的好东西都收罗到它的 Windows 中啊。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[以为 Linux 终端都是严肃的工作？想多了。以下是你可以在终端中使用字符画做的几件趣事。


Linux 终端其实没有想象中的那样 可怕。

当然啦，一开始它可能会令人望而却步，但是当我们更 了解 它的时候，我们就会喜欢上它的。

你可能会使用终端来做一些严肃的工作。不过，你也可以在终端中做很多有趣的事情。

其中的一项就是试一试  ASCII 字符画ASCII art。你可以在 Linux 终端中用各种命令行工具以 ASCII 的形式显示一些预定义的或是随机的消息、玩游戏，抑或是播放动画。

我的同事 Sreenath 喜欢探索此类不寻常的命令行工具并将他的发现分享给我。现在，我也将他的发现与你分享。



你的 Linux 发行版的仓库中应该已经有这些程序中的大多数了。你可以用系统的包管理器安装它们。为了使文章简洁，下文的安装指南均以 Ubuntu 为例。

1、lolcat：向终端加入缤纷色彩

虽然 lolcat 与 ASCII 字符画没有任何关系，至少，没有直接关系。

但是，我还是在文章开头就列出了它，因为它可以与其他的 ASCII 工具组合使用。

所以，它能做什么呢？它与 cat 指令很相似，但是它向输出内容加入随机的渐变色彩。



目前它看起来可能没什么用，但当其他 ASCII 工具通过 lolcat 输出时，你会看到它的效果。

用 apt 安装 lolcat：

sudo apt install lolcat


2、Aewan：漂亮地显示 ASCII 字符

Aewan 是一个多层 ASCII 图形、动画编辑器。它可以生成独立的，可被 cat 命令查看的 ASCII 字符画文件和便于命令行工具集成与解析的格式。

它包括两个工具：ASCII 编辑器 aewan，和文件查看器 aecat。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[按语：1930年代初，在两位年轻的历史学家陈恭禄与萧一山之间，围绕后者所著《清代通史》下卷，以天津《大公报·文学副刊》为主战场，发生了一场旷日持久、异常激烈的“文字战”。当年（1932），陈恭禄三十三岁，为金陵大学历史系讲师，萧一山三十一岁，为南京中央大学教授。论战过后，后者搜罗各方辩论文章，辑成《〈清代通史〉下卷讲稿辨论集》（北平中华印书局1934年8月版），并特作一长序，从自身立场回顾“辩论”始末，从一开始得见陈文，“闻而色喜”，鉴于“讨论之责任”而“竭诚答之”，到无法忍受对方“强诬狡赖”，进而“痛心国难，疾首士风”，不得不“浪费笔墨，详函申辨”，透露心态的曲折变化。这一场以“学术批评”为导火线而引发的笔墨官司，此来彼往，步步升级，生动呈现了民国学界生态的复杂面相，文字锋芒背后，蕴含当时学人之基础素养及各自汲引的思想学术资源，公共媒体性质的大报副刊为“书评”所提供的发表空间也充满了张力。（详拙文《陈恭禄与萧一山笔战始末》，《南方周末》2023年8月4日）陈恭禄书评从“论历史方法与史料”（举例凡十）、“论作者应有之态度”（举例凡三）、“指正书中错误”（举例凡十）、“指摘别字”（举例凡四）等四方面立论。最后一项，萧一山既诿责于“校对疏忽”，辩解说“印讲义作者均不校对，一委诸印刷局手民，故别字连篇也”，此处也不再赘。惟前三项兹事体大，质言之，包含了史法、史料、史观及史事考辨，荦荦大端，多关系“史学根本问题”者，与萧一山诸反论合观比勘，足资启发。窃以为“中国近代史学科”发轫期的学术派分、暗中竞逐，在陈、萧二氏笔战文字中多有透露，藉此可窥1930年代学界主流、非主流各派在纠葛中并进的多元学风。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This series adds support for loading and running on top of NVIDIA's GSP-RM firmware, instead of directly programming large portions of the hardware ourselves.
 The implementation is a little crude in places, but the goal of this series is to get (more-or-less) GSP-RM support on par with what we already support on HW. Next steps would be to look at what features GSP-RM enables us to more fully support, and clean up the GSP-RM integration once it's known what those will require.
 Things should be somewhat faster when running on GSP-RM, as it's able to control GPU clocks, which wasn't possible for us previously.
 SVM support is not available when running on top of GSP-RM at this point, due to GPU fault buffers not being implemented yet. This won't effect any real use-case, as SVM is experimental at best in nouveau anyway.
 Aside from that, things should more or less work as normal.
 GSP-RM support is disabled by default for now (except on Ada, where it's the only option) and can be enabled with nouveau.config=NvGspRm=1.
 There'll likely be some nit-picky bugs to sort through, but I don't anticipate any huge disasters. I've smoke-tested this on a selection of GPUs right back to nv50, testing both HW and GSP paths depending on the GPU, and more thoroughly tested on Turing/Ampere/Ada, both discrete and laptop GPUs.
 Firmware from NVIDIA is required to enable this support.

 Use VMs to learn how Linux works and to test software, use Linux applications on Windows when and where posisble, utilize dual booting but don't use dual booting as a crutch. Diving head first into Linux is a great way to ruin your experience because everything just becomes to much. 
 I know people have said this before but I can't express how important it is to test software before hand. Going head first into Linux from Windows IS possible but it ISN'T recommended. You're gonna find that a software doesn't work / isn't supported for Linux and your first instinct is to move back. Over the past few years, I've been slowly moving toward using more open source applications and applications that are OS agnostic (the application is available on all platforms).

HyperDX allows you to easily search and correlate logs, traces, metrics (alpha), and session replays all in one place. For example, if a user reports a bug “this button doesn't work," an engineer can play back what the user was doing in their browser and trace API calls back to the backend logs for that specific request, all from a single view.

Coming from an observability nerd background, with Warren being SRE #1 at his last startup and me previously leading dev experience at LogDNA/Mezmo, we knew there were gaps in the existing tools we were used to using.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[有一个软件用了 32 年版本号才变成 6.6

2023 年 9 月 17 日，Linus Torvalds 发布了 Linux 6.6-rc2，他写道，“我认为，6.6-rc2 最值得注意的一点是，它距 0.01 版本发布整整 32 年。如果你是计算机专业人士，这就是一个整数。”不过，除了这个日期之外，这个版本没有什么特别的，“到处都有随机修复，但没有一个看起来特别奇怪”。


消息来源：Phoronix



老王点评：之前我曾经觉得 Linux 内核的版本号变得太快了，但要是放到 32 年这个跨度上来说，倒也不算快，虽然近些年快的有点晕车。




看起来 ChatGPT 不会抢走你的编程工作

《连线》发布了一篇评论文章说，在功能开发受阻的情况下，解雇工程师并投入人工智能很可能会导致灾难，随后很快就会重新雇佣这些工程师。更合理的做法是，大型语言模型可以取代工程设计中的一些枯燥工作。如果提示词正确，它们可以提供自动完成建议或数据排序方法。计算的历史已经证明，试图减少开发人员的存在或简化他们的角色，最终只会增加工作的复杂性，使这些工作人员变得更加必要。如果说 ChatGPT 能够消除编码工作的枯燥乏味的话，那就像编译器终结了二进制工作的繁琐一样，它能让开发人员更轻松地专注于构建其作品的实际架构。


消息来源：连线



老王点评：每一个新的技术进步都淘汰了一些不能跟上的人，并创造了更多新的工作机会。




AI 专家认为构建出真正反映人类集体自我的 AI 是可能的

DeepMind 联合创始人 Mustafa Suleyman 在 2022 年创办了 AI 公司 Inflection， 获得了 15 亿美元的投资。他认为构建出真正反映人类集体自我的 AI 是可能的，能代表人类做出更好的权衡、更一致且更公平。他长期以来一直坚信对话是未来的界面，你将与 AI 进行交流，而不是点击按钮和打字。他认为 AI 的第一阶段是分类，深度学习表明可以训练计算机对不同类型的输入数据分类；第二阶段是生成式 AI，即当前大热的 ChatGPT 之类的 AI；第三阶段是交互式 AI：机器人可以通过调用其他软件和其他人来完成你为它们设定的任务。


消息来源：Technology Review



老王点评：虽然结合上一条看起来人类总会有事情做，但是可能最终的结果就是被 AI 养起来，干一些很轻松而 AI 干不了的事情。


回音


Unity 道歉，并承诺修改之前公布的定价政策。之前，由于受到死亡威胁，Unity 甚至关闭了两处办公室。]]></summary>

近年常常想起乔佖先生。
三十多年没见乔先生了。直到去年才辗转打听到先生已于2014年12月去世了。
认识乔先生，自然因为他是钱锺书先生在清华大学正式指导过的两位研究生之一。1986年夏天，忘了是谁告诉我，上海师大外文系教授乔佖曾是钱锺书先生的研究生。那时我已对钱先生很感兴趣了，当即联系了去采访乔先生。采访稿“钱锺书的风格”刊登在1986年9月27日的《文汇读书周报》上。此后几年里，与乔先生交往颇多，也常通信。

1986年9月27日的《文汇读书周报》上刊登的采访稿“钱锺书的风格”

前两年偶然翻出几封乔先生的信，又去重新了解他。
乔佖先生是山西祁县人，乔家大院的后人（那时还没听说过乔家大院，这也是近年才知道的）。1922年生，1949年毕业于燕京大学西语系，1952年清华大学外文系研究生毕业；1957年起任教北京大学西语系，1980年以后在上海师范大学任教。没有专著，甚至没读到过他的文章，也没有整本的译著，参与翻译过英国作家弗·福塞斯的长篇小说《豺狼的日子》，以及《狄更斯评论集》中燕卜荪等几篇论文。
据他晚年时与他有来往的北大或上师大的老师回忆，乔先生从来不提自己是钱先生的学生，所以他们都不知道。为此，我还请清华大学的好友刘石教授查到了乔先生研究生毕业的成绩学分记载表。现照录如下：
学号姓名：38研7，乔佖。
籍贯：山西省祁县。入学年龄：26。
毕业初试：
成绩：87%。
举行日期：一九五一年十月十日。
应考课程：
1. English Romanticism in the Age of Byron, Shelley and Keats；
2. John Keats。
考试委员：吴达元。温德、赵绍（应为诏）熊、罗念生、钱锺书、李赋宁、浦江清、卞之琳、周珏良。
论文考试：
导师：钱锺书。
成绩：82%。
举行日期：一九五二年八月十八日。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[一款昂贵的 Linux 平板电脑，注重安全和隐私。让我们拭目以待。


Purism 是一家日益流行的计算机硬件产品制造商，专门提供配备注重隐私的开源 Linux 发行版的笔记本电脑、台式机和移动设备。

最近，他们发布了一款新产品 Librem 11 平板电脑，配备了一些非常简洁的硬件。

让我们看看它能提供什么！


📋 这不是赞助文章或认可。在订购之前，你应该从它的官方网站上研究有关该产品的更多信息（包括运输查询）。


Librem 11 有什么？



Librem 11 被称为安全平板电脑，由其自用 Linux 发行版 PureOS 以及 PureBoot 提供支持，提供非常安全和专注隐私的体验。

Purism 确保了设备的安全和隐私，这要归功于他们采取的各种措施：

第一个是安全启动过程，得益于 PureBoot，它可以与 Librem Key 结合在一起，以进一步增强安全性，并在与 PureBoot 一起使用时以加密方式识别篡改。

第二个是 Purism 承诺不监视用户，避免任何监视或数据挖掘。

最后一项是 Librem 11 附加的“反拦截”服务，确保设备在制造和运输过程的之前、期间或之后不会被篡改。

你可能想知道，所有这些都在谈论安全和隐私，但是，它的配置如何？



Librem 11 由 英特尔 N5100 CPU 以及 8 GB LPDDR4 RAM 和 高达 1 TB 的 NVMe 存储提供支持。

至于显示屏，该平板电脑配备多点触控 60hz 11.5 英寸 AMOLED 显示屏，分辨率为 2560×1600。


📋 出于安全考虑，CPU 上的英特尔管理引擎（IME）默认处于禁用状态。


它还预装了一个带有倾斜支持，具有 4096 级压力的笔，以及一个可拆卸键盘，在平板电脑折叠时还可用作保护套。

其他一些亮点包括：


指纹识别器。

英特尔超高清显卡。

1 个 USB Type-C 3.1 端口。

借助 英特尔 AX201 芯片支持 Wi-Fi 6。

支持 Bluetooth 5，由 英特尔 9460 芯片提供。

3.5 毫米音频插孔（麦克风输入和耳机输出组合）。

前置 2MP 摄像头，后置 5MP 自动/手动对焦摄像头。


你可以浏览其 公告博文 以了解有关这款注重安全的平板电脑的更多信息。

🛒 获取 Librem 11

Purism 的 Librem 11 平板电脑现已发售，价格为 999 美元，交货期长达 10 天。

但是，如果你居住在美国，你很可能会比其他地区更早收到它。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[“tmpfs” is a filesystem that saves all of its files in virtual memory. By using it none of the files created on it are saved to the system’s hard drive. Thus, if we unmount a “tmpfs” mounting point every file which is stored there is lost. tmpfs holds all of the data into the kernel internal caches (https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/filesystems/tmpfs.html). By the way, it used to be called “shm fs” (https://cateee.net/lkddb/web-lkddb/TMPFS.html).
 Moreover, “tmpfs” is able to swap space if needed (it can also leverage “Transparent Huge Pages”), it will fill up until it reaches the maximum limit of the filesystem — as shown in the screenshot below. tmpfs supports both POSIX ACLs and extended attributes (https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man5/tmpfs.5.html). Overall, if we want to use tmpfs we can use the following command: “mount -t tmpfs tmpfs [LOCATION]”. We can also set a size using “-o size=[REQUESTED_SIZE]” — as shown in the screenshot below.
 Lastly, there are different directories which are based on “tmpfs” like: “/run” and “/dev/shm” (more on them in future writeups). To add support for “tmpfs” we should enable “CONFIG_TMPFS” when building the Linux kernel (https://cateee.net/lkddb/web-lkddb/TMPFS.html). We can see the implementation as part of the Linux’s kernel source code (https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v6.6-rc1/source/mm/shmem.c#L133).

我的两位孙子，Mint 和 Kasen，请求我帮助他们搭建游戏电脑。他们的请求让我感到非常欣喜。这不仅给了我一个与他们共度时光的美好机会，也让我能够帮助他们了解科技。同时，我能深入探讨电脑对环境产生的影响。

等一下！这似乎有些离题，对吧？其实并非如此，本文就是为了阐述这个问题。

旧电脑的命运是什么？

关于旧电脑的处理（以及处理的原因）是我们讨论的核心。首先，普通电脑通常在提供服务五年左右后被替换。理由何在？

我在一个名为《CHRON》的面向小企业的刊物的在线文章中找到 这样一篇文章，电脑的寿命被建议在三至五年。这个建议的部分原因是，假定电脑在生命周期的这个阶段开始变慢。这篇文章，以及其他的一些文章，都在鼓励人们在大约同样的时间段内更换更新、速度更快的电脑。当然，这些压力主要来源于电脑和芯片的厂商，他们想要保持收入的增长。

再者，美国国税局也通过规定电脑所能完全折旧的时间是五年，以此间接强化了这个服务寿命的观念。

我们首先来讨论一下关于电脑会变慢的迷思。电脑实际上是不会变慢的，恒定的时钟速度一直在运作。无论是 2.8GHz 还是 4.5GHz，当电脑忙碌时，它们总是以那个速度运行。当然，当电脑闲置或事情不多时，将会有意识地降低它的时钟速度以节省电力。

电脑变慢并不是因为它们变老了。装有 Windows 系统的电脑在使用过程中，会积累大量的恶意软件、间谍软件、广告软件和恐吓软件。这些垃圾软件拖慢了电脑的运行。电脑用户逐渐认为这是正常的，安于电脑性能下降的境况。

Linux 驰骋救援

作为朋友和熟人心目中的电脑专家，人们有时会将他们不再需要的旧电脑送给我。他们认为电脑运行速度慢，因此选择交给我，并让我在将它们带到我家附近几个街区的电子设备回收中心之前清除硬盘数…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Working as a sysadmin and devops, I automated a lot of my tasks at work via various bash and python scripts. Many of them could be placed in crontab, but I still needed to run a few manually when a user requested me to do so.
 Not anymore, as I built a tool to help me with this: https://github.com/izalac/ssh-script-dashboard
 It's a very lightweight, single page, responsive and customizable webapp which can be set up as a dashboard to execute CLI programs and your custom scripts - on local machine or via SSH. Designed for every screen size, and it will also work on mobile.
 It's also workplace-ready as it supports SSO authentication/authorization via OpenID Connect (OIDC), and event logging for audit purposes. Supports both plaintext and HTML output, so it will render your links, images, tables etc., and this can be even used to expand the functionality without modifying the source code.
 While the primary target audience are sysadmins, devops, and other professionals working in related positions, I imagine this could also be of interest to some developers (to see how some infra stuff is coded), and power users.
 Stack: Python, Flask, Jinja2 templates, Tailwind CSS, HTMX. Tested in standalone, docker, podman, and deployed on OpenShift configurations, against Keycloak and RH-SSO as OIDC providers. Free software under GPL. Extensive documentation, both in markdown and in source code. Use, modify, share, have fun.

内核级 SMB 服务器 Ksmbd 进入稳定状态

在 Linux 内核 6.6 候选发布版中，包含了一个 Ksmbd 稳定版，它是三星开发的内核级服务器，通过 SMB 协议提供文件和打印机的网络共享服务。Linux 一直以来都在使用用户空间的 Samba 解决方案，但由于性能、内存占用和复杂度等问题并不理想。Ksmbd 是与 Samba 项目合作开发的，其目标是成为比 Samba 性能更强、重点更突出的解决方案。现在它经过了大量的安全测试，被认为达到了稳定状态，计划进入 Linux 内核 6.6。

人工智能生成的艺术“通过”图灵测试

有人在网上发布了一些使用人工智能生成的图片，用螺旋或棋盘纹理展示了中世纪村庄。这些图片因其非凡的几何特质迅速在社交媒体上获得广泛赞誉。它们是使用稳定扩散和控制网引导技术创建的。之前也有人采用相同的技术来创建图片式的二维码。Y-Combinator 联合创始人 Paul Graham 甚至将之比喻为：“对我来说，这是人工智能生成的艺术通过图灵测试的时刻。”

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[钟少异（章静绘）

谈到车战，总会让我们想到春秋时代的种种典故，例如，郑庄公以“鱼丽之阵”大败周天子，齐桓公险些被管仲射死，晋文公“退避三舍”……春秋时代的霸主们，正是通过车战才得以夺取霸权。军事科学院战争研究院研究员钟少异长期致力于中国古代军事历史、军事技术和军事思想研究，编著有《中国古代军事工程技术史》《中国古代火药火器史研究》《五千年的征战：中国军事史》《安邦大略——中国古代国家安全战略思想论析》《孙子的战争智慧》《中国古代军事通识课》《古兵雕虫——钟少异自选集》等。在接受《上海书评》专访时，他介绍了先秦时期关于车战的种种情况，也梳理了战车从兴起到衰亡的全过程。
谈起先秦时期的车战，有一个概念叫作“车战时代”，能否请您先介绍一下这个概念的由来？
钟少异：“车战时代”这个概念，源于汉晋以来注经学者的一个论断：“三代车战”。中国传世最早的关于夏商周时期的文献典籍，涉及战争，都说使用战车。如中国第一部文章总集《尚书》中有一篇《甘誓》，相传是夏朝的建立者夏启征伐有扈氏的誓师词，其中提到“左不攻于左”“右不攻于右”“御非其马之正”（左边不能尽到左边的职责，右边不能尽到右边的职责，驭手控不好马驾不好车），都要受到严惩。这被视为夏朝用马车作战的例子。往后到了夏末商汤讨伐夏桀，先秦文献称双方都用了战车。再往后到商末周武王讨伐商纣王，牧野之战，文献记载双方都使用大量战车。《史记》甚至说，武王“戎车三百乘”，“诸侯兵会者车四千乘”。西周时期，留下许多描写战争的诗篇，收入了中国第一部诗歌总集《诗经》中，这些诗几乎都要对战车大加描述。如《诗经·小雅·六月》：
织文鸟章，白旆央央。
元戎十乘，以先启行。
戎车既安，如轾如轩。
四牡既佶，既佶且闲。
薄伐猃狁，至于大原……
又如《诗经·小雅·采芑》：
方叔莅止，其车三千，旂旐央央……
戎车啴啴，啴啴焞焞，如霆如雷。
显允方叔，征伐猃狁，蛮荆来威。…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[扩展 VxFX 文件系统是 Linux/Unix 管理员的一项日常任务，可以通过以下文章中描述的几个步骤在线完成此任务：

在此，磁盘组没有足够的可用空间，因此我们将在现有磁盘组（DG）中添加新磁盘，然后调整其大小。

相关文章：


如何在 Linux 中创建 VxVM 卷和文件系统

如何在 Linux 上创建共享 VxFS 文件系统


步骤 1：识别文件系统

使用 df 命令 检查要增加/扩展的文件系统，并记下以下输出中的磁盘组（DG）和卷名称，稍后在运行 vxdg 和 vxresize 命令时将使用这些名称。

# df -hP /data

Filesystem                  Size  Used Avail Use% Mounted on
/dev/vx/dsk/testdg/testvol  9.0G  8.4G 0.6G  95%  /data


根据上面的输出，VxFS 文件系统大小为 9.0 GB，我们希望额外扩展 5 GB 并发布此活动，VxFS 大小将为 14 GB。

在本例中，DG 名称为 testdg，卷名称为 testvol。

步骤 2：获取新磁盘/LUN

新磁盘必须由存储团队映射到主机，这可能需要 CR 批准，因此提出 CR 并向相关团队添加必要的任务，并且还包括此活动的回滚计划。

步骤 3：扫描磁盘/LUN

存储团队将新 LUN 映射到主机后，获取 LUN id 并将其保存。

使用以下命令扫描 LUN 以在操作系统级别发现它们。

for disk_scan in `ls /sys/class/scsi_host`; do 
    echo "Scanning $disk_scan…Completed"
    echo "- - -" > /sys/cl…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[美国一位女士最近求助热门机器人聊天工具ChatGPT成功地诊断出了她4岁儿子患的罕见疾病，此前17位医生都未能找出问题所在。


这位女士名叫考特尼（Courtney），为了保护家庭隐私，她没有透露自己的姓氏。在新冠疫情最严重的时候，考特尼四岁的儿子亚历克斯开始出现令人不安的症状。他非常痛苦，咀嚼各种各样的东西，而且停止长高了。


2021年，亚历克斯的左右腿似乎出现了不平衡，“他会用右脚走在前面，拖着左脚走，”考特尼说。


在三年多的时间里，考特尼带着儿子看了17位医生，但似乎没有人能准确地指出发生了什么。在ChatGPT爆火之后，考特尼开始考虑使用这个人工智能工具来弄清楚到底是怎么回事。


ChatGPT判断亚历克斯有脊髓异常，结果证明是正确的。


考特尼在接受采访时表示：“我一行一行地查看了他（核磁共振成像）记录中的所有内容，并将其输入ChatGPT。ChatGPT最后判断是“脊髓栓系综合征”，这是一种脊髓附着在脊柱周围组织上的神经系统综合征。


考特尼加入了Facebook上一个有这种综合征的儿童家庭的小组，看到了与亚历克斯类似的故事。


Courtney在与一位新的神经外科医生会面时提出了ChatGPT的建议，这位外科医生证实了这个人工智能程序的判断是正确的，并通过核磁共振成像确定了亚历克斯脊椎的固定位置。


亚历克斯最近接受了脊柱修复手术，目前正在康复中。


尽管ChatGPT帮助考特尼确定了亚历克斯的诊断，但医生仍然警告说，ChatGPT可能会出错。


美国主要医生组织美国医学协会主席杰西·埃伦菲尔德博士在一份声明中表示：“OpenAI的ChatGPT和其他生成式人工智能产品目前存在已知的问题，并不是没有错误。”


一个问题是，ChatGPT会编造答案——这个过程被称为“幻觉”。这个机器人聊天工具也容易出现简单的计算错误，比如不准确地“解决”数独游戏，或者错误地计算出刚刚正确计算的BMI。


尽管如此，一些医生还是对该程序诊断疾病的能力印象深刻。


哈佛大学的医生和计算机科学家艾萨克·科汉博士在他的著作《医学中的人工智能革命》中测试了ChatGPT的最新版本GPT-4。


他写道，新版本的ChatGPT可能比他观察到的许多医生都要好。它还能答对90%以上的美国医学考试执照问题。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello,
 I mostly spent my time on windows and always heard how amazing Apple operating system is.
 Never could afford it. Got to use it in 2015 but it felt dull and boring.
 Years went by and I bumped into Linux.
 Tried dual booting and I loved it.
 I couldn’t get enough Linux to a point where I installed only Ubuntu on a brand new ssd and it was sky rocketing. I tried fedora, Ubuntu, Kali, mint, Debian, Pop os, but always came back to Ubuntu.
 Fast forward got my first laptop and the most affordable good laptop I could get was a thinkpad e14 Linux ram smooth as butter on it. No problems! 
 No more blue screens or random updates. Smooth as hell.
 I went into deep depression needed a change.
 Someone offered to by my 3 year old thinkpad for a good price. I said yes!
 Got the MacBook m1 air.
 Loved it Premium, quality and the track pad is unmatched! 
 Though I miss my thinkpad cause if you were buy a MacBook you need to baby it. Which I don’t really like. I got a laptop to work and not baby it all the time.
 I’m gonna use this as long as I can but to those who ever wonder what’s best in over all use I feel Linux is king.
 Stable, smooth, free, privacy! And can build high security. 
 I only wish my MacBook wasn’t a delicate darling. 
 Feel free to ask any questions
 Edit: terms of privacy Linux > mac

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[大家好！今天我和一个朋友讨论 Git 的工作原理，我们感到奇怪，Git 是如何存储你的文件的？我们知道它存储在 .git 目录中，但具体到 .git 中的哪个位置，各个版本的历史文件又被存储在哪里呢？

以这个博客为例，其文件存储在一个 Git 仓库中，其中有一个文件名为 content/post/2019-06-28-brag-doc.markdown。这个文件在我的 .git 文件夹中具体的位置在哪里？过去的文件版本又被存储在哪里？那么，就让我们通过编写一些简短的 Python 代码来探寻答案吧。

Git 把文件存储在 .git/objects 之中

你的仓库中，每一个文件的历史版本都被储存在 .git/objects 中。比如，对于这个博客，.git/objects 包含了 2700 多个文件。

$ find .git/objects/ -type f | wc -l
2761



注意：.git/objects 包含的信息，不仅仅是 “仓库中每一个文件的所有先前版本”，但我们暂不详细讨论这一内容。


这里是一个简短的 Python 程序（find-git-object.py），它可以帮助我们定位在 .git/objects 中的特定文件的具体位置。

import hashlib
import sys

def object_path(content):
    header = f"blob {len(content)}\0"
    data = header.encode() + content
    sha1 = hashlib.sha1()
    sha1.update(data)
    digest = sha1.hexdigest()
    return f".git/objects/{dige…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Just ranting that after 20 years of Linux, my main computer is now running Windows and I hate myself.
 Jumped out because in the last few months SDL and GTK kept releasing buggy stuff that broke fullscreen a few times, and I believe that Arch is right in pulling the latest release of all packages, just sad that some libs have shitty testing practice, so don't tell me to get Debian with it's 3 years old libs missing half the features I need to code.
 And then Steam re-did their UI poorly to the point that half the user base need to press Ctrl when left clicking with their mouse in their menus. Is it their fault? Is it a lib they use? I was happy in vanilla openbox before that but then all fullscreen games started freezing. Proton/wine issue or underlying lib? I blame wayland for making dev not test properly in x11 anymore. I dunno. Maybe I'm imagining things. Had to switch to KDE plasma x11, which solved the Steam menu and games issue but KDE sucks, launched everything super slowly and doesn't bring them in focus. I'm out. (for now of course, I mean, Windows blows and keeps showing me unsolicted ads about stuff in the notification corner).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey! I'm sharing a project I've worked on for a bit, it aims to create portable sandboxed applications with ease. Like a portable steam installation with its home set in the same directory as the created portable binary; or a portable wine installation that uses its own glibc and works on musl systems. Besides the main goal of being a hybrid of flatpak and appimage, I also worked on making it possible to create portable applications as easily as installing them with apt or pacman. Here's an example:
  # Resize ./arch.fim fim-resize 4G # Set default home directory ./arch.fim fim-config-set home '"$FIM_DIR_BINARY"/home.steam' # Install steam ## Select the appropriated drivers for your GPU when asked ./arch.fim fim-root fakechroot pacman -S steam # Set permissions ./arch.fim fim-perms-set wayland,x11,gpu,session_bus # Set command to run by default ./arch.fim fim-cmd steam # Clear cache ./arch.fim fim-root fakechroot pacman -Scc --noconfirm # Compress ./arch.fim fim-compress # Rename mv ./arch.fim ./steam 
 The project is on gitlab and github. Also here's the full script for the above example.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[GCC 准备引入一“键”安全加固选项

已有各种加固选项来提高生成的二进制文件的安全性，但可能并非所有项目都在使用这些选项，原因可能是不了解它们，也可能是软件没有得到积极的维护。经过讨论，GNU 编译器集合（GCC）正准备添加一个 -fhardened 编译器选项，该选项将启用各种加固功能，以提高生成的二进制文件的安全性/稳健性。该加固选项认为合理的选项不能影响应用程序二进制接口（ABI），不能导致 “严重” 的性能问题，也不能导致新的构建错误。如果不出意外，这个选项补丁将很快被合并到明年初发布的 GCC 14.1 稳定版中。

老王点评：这样的一键选项很有必要，甚至我认为将来可能会成为默认值。




红帽正在研究延迟模块签名验证以加快 Linux 启动时间

红帽工程师提交了一组补丁，在启用模块签名检查功能时，可以延迟对这些签名的检查，内核会等待用户空间的通信，然后再开始检查。因此，可以在不影响系统安全的情况下显著提高启动速度。该功能引入了一个新的启动时内核参数，允许用户请求这种延迟。在某些情况下，启动速度变得至关重要。而有时候安全检查是多余的，因为在此过程中已经对内核和 initrd 镜像执行了加密检查，可以合理地认为其内容也是安全的。


消息来源：Phoronix



老王点评：这是安全和效率的合理折中。




Meta 的 VR 世界虚拟化身终于有腿了

此前，Meta 公司的《地平线世界》的虚拟化身因为只有上半身而受到广泛嘲笑。不过现在它终于有了虚拟腿。如果你启动《地平线世界》并在菜单空间中照镜子，你就会看到自己化身的全身，而且当你进入一个世界时，其他人也会看到。但是你自己低头时还是看不到你的腿。不过，目前还没有一款 VR 系统内置腿部追踪功能，因此虚拟腿部与真实腿部的实际动作并不一致。


消息来源：Upload VR



老王点评：我觉得目前的 VR 还处于比较可笑、原始的阶段，需要等待基础设施的进一步发展才会真正形成。]]></summary>

为了能在软件迭代交付周期内按时交付优质的文档，DevOps 和 DevSecOps 的文档实践也需要是敏捷的。这与实现 DevOps 类似，只是更偏向自动化和敏捷的内容处理方法。如果文档现在才进入你的机构的 DevOps 讨论，那么是时候让文档实践追上 DevOps 的步伐了。

下面是 DevOps 文档成熟度的四个层次：

第一层：临时且孤立

在最低一级成熟度（最不成熟），文档编制工作没有和 DevOps 开发对齐。开发团队和文档团队按照各自的路线开展工作，常常导致文档落后于开发。在竞争激烈的“云”世界里，因为文档问题而推迟产品发布是不可接受的。

人员

这个阶段的文档编制人员还没有摆脱传统的工作方式。技术写作technical writer人员隶属于一个中心化的单独团队，与开发团队是脱节的。技术写作组和开发团队之间的鸿可能是由多方面原因造成的：


造成团队分裂和孤立的公司政治

团队只是将技术文档视为项目验收清单上的检查项，而不是推动项目成功的资产

事后才雇佣技术写作人员

技术写作的优先级与开发团队的实际情况不匹配


这个阶段，另一个在人员配置上的挑战是如何“界定工作完成”。刚接触敏捷实践的技术写作可能难以适应 CI/CD 工具链和流程。

文档工具和流程

这个阶段的技术写作仍习惯于使用传统的办公工具，比如办公套件和布局程序。这些工具不够敏捷，没有版本控制和内容管理的要求。它们无法与 DevOps 工具链高效集成，不能支撑快速开发。在这个成熟度，技术写作仍然参照遗留的模板和流程。

成果

这个级别交付的文档可能是过时的，甚至缺乏技术准确性的。如果开发团队以 DevOps 的速度推进工作，而技术文档编制却遵循传…]]></summary>

1862年9月30日，新任首相奥托·冯·俾斯麦在普鲁士议会下院的三十多名预算委员会成员面前宣称：“德意志的未来不在于普鲁士的自由主义，而在于她的力量……当代的重大问题并不是通过演说和多数派决议就能解决的……这正是1848年和1849年所犯的错误……而要用铁和血来解决！”
然而，这番著名的“铁血演说”虽传扬于今世，却远不为当时的德意志所容。俾斯麦的言论不久便像野火一般烧遍了德意志各邦，不但普鲁士议会拒绝通过预算，更在全欧洲受到了广泛批评指责。“铁血”宰相的初啼远不如今人想象那般顺利。那真正在“铁与血”的外皮下阐明了强国之道，为德意志统一立论的，并非政客短短几句的惊世之言，亦非财经人士夸夸其谈的美好设想，而是斯时崛起的一大学派——德国经济学“历史学派”（Historical School）基于历史的分析判断。恰如古斯塔夫·冯·施穆勒（Gustav von Schmoller）所言：“事实无情地清楚地告诉他们，在最先进的国家以最严酷的民族利己主义，用金融、立法和暴力的一切武器，用航海法和禁航法，用舰队和海事法庭，用公司，用国家指导和支配下的贸易，为生存而进行集体斗争时——他们若不成为铁锤，就一定成为铁砧。”（《重商主义制度及其历史意义》130页，以下引用此书仅标注页码）历史学派以重商主义下笔，恰如《商君书》之于秦，《盐铁论》之于汉，写就了德意志帝国统一背后的经济秘密，也揭开了近代西方列强崛起的晦暗阴影。
学派沉浮与理念之争
历史学派起于十九世纪，恰与德意志统一同步，也与重商主义的没落共行。在西方经济学中，亚当·斯密的《国富论》横空出世有着别样意义。通过亚当·斯密精心的堆叠建构，新大陆的原料掠夺与货物倾销、三角贸易的贩奴船、持私掠…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[openSUSE Leap 将被新产品取代。怎么回事？


openSUSE 项目的长期贡献者 Richard Brown 分享了最近贡献者调查的一些结果。

这是关于用新的社区构建的产品取代 openSUSE Leap 的兴趣和可行性。哦？一个 openSUSE Leap 的替代品？

有趣的消息，对吧？ 😳

这并不令人震惊。随着 适应性 Linux 平台Adaptable Linux Platform （ALP） 的推出，openSUSE 团队曾 暗示 Leap 将于 2022 停止运营。所以，这是预料之中的。

但是，有哪些选择可以替代 openSUSE Leap？

Tumbleweed 衍生版可能取代 Leap

根据这份更换提案，我们有两种选择：


Linarite：一个普通的老式桌面发行版，软件包的选择范围可能比我们习惯的 Leap 更小，除非我们找到更多的贡献者来支持所有的软件包。

Slowroll ：是 Tumbleweed 的衍生版本，尽可能地自动构建，使用自动化和度量标准仅在特定条件（最大周期、X 周无变化等）后才从 Tumbleweed 复制软件包。基本上，它试图提供比全速运行的 Tumbleweed 不那么风险的东西。



作为这件事的后继，openSUSE 现在为 Slowroll 做了一个 页面 供你测试。


然而，调查结果显示意见不一。

大多数用户选择 “Slowroll” 作为未来可行的替代方案，他们愿意为此做出贡献。

相比之下，贡献者们则投票不取代 openSUSE Leap 或使用 Tumbleweed 替代它。

但是，在选择一个选项时，贡献者选择了 “Linarite”。

因此，用户和现有贡献者有不同的选择。

openSUSE 决定按照用户的喜好使用滚动发行版 Slowroll。它需要比调查中表示感兴趣的更多的贡献者。

Richard 还透露，两个替代方案中的任何一个都需要比 Leap 付出更多的努力，而且截至目前，对这两个选项感兴趣的 贡献者数量比 Leap 少。


即使有 61 个人直接为代码库和 backports/PackageHub 做出贡献，Leap 仍然举步维艰。这时我们就可以借用 SLE 代码库，这大大减少了所需的工作。

Slowroll 或 Linarite 都比 Leap 需要更多的打包和维护工作。


他还强调，任何 Leap 替代品都应该专注于桌面场景，而不是试图同时兼顾服务器和桌面的需求。

换还是不换？

调查结果公告 要求社区回答 openSUSE 是否应该继续替换 Leap。

而且，如果他们继续这样做，社区可以帮助他们支持吗？

💬 你认为 openSUSE 的最终决定应该是什么？ 请在下面的评论部分告诉我你的想法。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi i have a couple of old computers without enough disks for all of them (I get old computers for free). I first thought about pooling them, using a nas for storage and running a vm on top like an ESXi hypervisor but it looks like there isn't really a thing like that on linux. I found a few things that attempt to do that but i was not convinced.
 Do you have any suggestion to try and pool my computers together to run a few simple services like a tor node, a minecraft server, monero node, a nas... things like that. I have a few simple services i'd like to host but i dont want to install linux 4 times and always change on which os i run which service because now i got a better computer or i got one more service that would run better on that computer but its already maxed out and all the reorganisation. And it'd be very cool if i could scrape just a little more performance by not running 4 ssh instances, 4 kernels and all the services i could have only one of running if it was all on the same computer.
 Any ideas?

        <link href="https://www.williamlong.info/archives/7290.html"/>
        <updated>2023-09-15T16:11:10.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[苹果官微宣布，iPhone 15系列机型将于9月22日正式发售。今天起，就可在Apple官网、Apple Store app和Apple Store官方在线商店预购。


截至21时30分，所有首发（22日）当天现货已经全部预定一空，目前下单邮寄需等待3-4周时间，苹果新机吸引力依旧不减。


正如往年一样，20时一到，苹果官网和官方APP出现拥堵，多数网友需等待数分钟才得以进入预定界面，在20时30分左右，记者发现，以上海地区为例，iPhone 15系列依然可以预定，但Pro系列只剩下蓝色的256G和512G容量可以预约22日当天取货。


苹果预售分为线下直营店取货和官网邮寄，有苹果直营店的城市，取机时间为22、23、24日三天，这也是果粉首选的方式，毕竟可以第一时间拿到新机。


有果粉向记者表示，通过官方APP在20时06分成功下单预定22日的iPhone 15 Pro Max 256G 原色钛金属版本，在下完第一单后，想再购买一台1TB版本时发现很难进入预定界面，过了十来分钟才得以进入，但最终因货源问题只能选择仅有的蓝色1TB版本，“说不上遇冷，还是比较难抢的，但也没有想象中那么难抢，有些颜色半小时后依然能预约到货。”


北京时间9月13日凌晨，苹果正式发布了iPhone 15系列新机，全系采用了灵动岛设计，USB-C接口，Phone 15和iPhone 15 Plus起售价分别为5999元和6999元，Pro系列采用了3纳米的A17 Pro芯片，并使用了钛金属边框，iPhone 15 Pro和iPhone 15 Pro Max起售价为7999元和9999元。


苹果iPhone15系列新机发布后被认为创新不足，加上这一时间段有华为的Mate 60系列发售，有行业人士认为这次iPhone 15系列新机预售可能会遇冷。


微博等社交网站上，有多名抢购成功的果粉晒出自己的订单。有的用户显示iPhone 15 Pro Max将在10月17日-24日才能发货，这也意味着Pro系列在中国的交付时间已经延迟了4-5周，而另一款iPhone 15 Pro交付也将延迟2-3周。整体来说，iPhone 15系列的热度还是不错。

information around for future use to avoid the cost of looking it up again.
The kernel aggressively caches pages of file data, directory entries,
inodes, slab objects, and much more.  Without active measures, though,
caches will tend to grow without bounds, leading to memory exhaustion.  The
kernel's "shrinker" mechanism exists to be that active measure, but
shrinkers have some performance difficulties of their own.  This
patch series from Qi Zheng seeks to address one of the worst of those
by removing some locking overhead.]]></summary>

一周前，GitHub 将用户主页中的“关注”信息流和算法推荐的“为你”信息合并，就像在浏览 Twitter 一样，信息流中不按时间顺序排列，也可能混入你没有关注的内容。这让不少用户感到非常生气。有用户说，“不是所有东西都要变得像 Twitter、Facebook 或 Instagram 一样。我们是来完成工作的，而不是来参与你的算法认为我们喜欢的任何事情。”GitHub 回应了这些反馈，称部分受质疑的行为实际上是由于漏洞造成的，现已得到修复，同时加倍坚持其新的信息流的决定。GitHub 称出于性能考虑“删除了‘为用户订阅的资源库推送事件’的功能。我们不会轻易做出这些改变，……我们必须优先考虑可用性、用户体验和性能”。

黑客声称只打了 10 分钟电话就关闭了米高梅酒店

一个勒索软件组织声称对周二发生的米高梅酒店网络中断事件负责。该组织声称使用了常见的社会工程学策略，“入侵所做的一切就是在 LinkedIn 找到一名员工，然后致电服务台”，获取员工信任以获得内部信息。据该组织称，授予初始访问权限的对话仅用了 10 分钟。另据报道，他们试图从美高梅骗取赎金，但该公司拒绝支付。受此影响，米高梅的股价已下跌超过 6%。

JetBrains 放弃开源插件，宣布全新 Rust IDE

JetBrains 宣布了 RustRover 的早期访问预览版，这是一个全新的 Rust 集成开发环境。但同时，JetBrains 将不再开发现有的支持 Rust 的开源插件，不会再对其修复漏洞或添加新功能。该插件可与 JetBrains IDE 免费的社区版一起使用。而新发布的 RustRover 也将不会推出社区版，但正式版的发布日期还没有确定，至少在 2024 年 9 月前都只会发布公开测试版本。

二十世纪初，欧洲大陆上迅速生长起一种影响范围极大的艺术运动——超现实主义运动，此后蔓延至全世界，造就了二十世纪生命最长也最辉煌的艺术形式。两次世界大战被认为是超现实主义产生的历史背景，而欧洲的心理学理论在当时的繁荣又为超现实主义提供了哲学依据。
超现实主义艺术家作为“他者”，曾经从中国书画中汲取来自“异文化”的营养，创作出诸多明显带有中国书法特征的绘画作品，并且在材料上选用宣纸水墨。朱迪特·赖格尔与克里斯蒂安·多特雷蒙是最为典型的两位画家。

 This is my personal rant which I wanted to write for some time already.
 This is a story of someone going from Windows to Ubuntu to Arch to Gentoo, Nix and Guix to finally returning to Windows.
 Some context, I'm someone who used Linux exclusively for several years. I went from Ubuntu (with Unity, yes, I remember those days) to Arch (which I consider my main distro) to Gentoo (I loved that) and I was even using Nix and Guix for some time.
 I used to be that kind of person who perfectly customizes the system for my specific needs. I was daily driving very customized XMonad WM which is IMO a beautiful piece of software. I still absolutely love Linux, but it's been a year already that I'm only using Windows 11.
 So how did I end up going back to Windows? T…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[当地时间9月12日，墨西哥议会首次召开与“不明异常现象”相关的公开听证会。会上，两名科学家在播放了几段显示“不明飞行物和不明异常现象”的视频后不久，展出了两具疑似“外星生物”的遗骸，相关话题很快冲上“热搜”。


这两具小型的“非人类”尸体被放在有窗的盒子里，供所有人观看。这两具小型的木乃伊样本是从秘鲁的库斯科（Cusco）运来的，据信有一千年的历史。科学家们共同主持了这次活动。研究者在会上称，这些标本已经由墨西哥国立自治大学（UNAM）的科学家研究过，科学家们使用放射性碳定年法提取了DNA证据。“这些样本不是我们地球进化的一部分……它们不是在不明飞行物坠毁后发现的生物。它们是在硅藻（藻类）矿中发现的，后来被化石化了”。


我觉得，如果外星人有能力在1000年前抵达地球，说明其已经具有星际穿越的能力，其科技肯定远远高于地球文明，那么为什么现在地球还没有被外星人统治？反而地球人在展示外星人尸体？


根据费米悖论，我认为墨西哥展示的外星人遗体是假的。


人类一直使用探测电波、天文望远镜等方法探测外星人存在的迹象，但迄今为止并没有确切证据表明外星生命的存在。


由于光速是人类所发现的自然界中物体运动的最大速度，宇宙大爆炸理论又指出宇宙如今一直处在极快的膨胀中，由于宇宙的尺度过大，即使用光速也无法探索遥远的宇宙，这就引出了一个重要的理论：费米悖论。


费米悖论讲述的是有关尺度和概率的论点和稀缺的证据之间的矛盾，费米悖论指的是，宇宙尺度和年龄意味着高等外星文明应该存在，为什么地球人没有发现外星人或者外星物品。


费米悖论的第一点，即尺度问题，即使智慧生命以很小的概率出现在围绕这些恒星的行星中，那么仅仅在银河系内就应该有相当大数量的文明存在。地球不是特殊的，仅仅是一个典型的适居行星。


费米悖论的第二点，考虑到智慧生命克服资源稀少性的能力和对外扩张的倾向性，任何高等文明都很可能会寻找新的资源和开拓他们所在的恒星系统，然后是涉足邻近的星系。宇宙诞生超过137亿年，人类没有在地球或可观测宇宙的其他地方，找到其他智慧生命存在的切实可靠的证据。


从宇宙的尺度和年龄来看，外星人理应能快速扩张，留下外星殖民的迹象，例如探测器或者信息采集装置。某些理论上的探索技术，比如冯·诺依曼探测器（一种能自我复制的探测器，旨在利用任何恒星系统中发现的原材料进行自我复制，并探索宇宙），能够在短短50万年中探索完银河系大小的星系，却只需要相对少量的物质和能量投入。但现在我们还没有见到任何一个冯·诺依曼探测器。


英国科学家康塞利斯和韦斯特比认为，假设银河系其他类似地球的星球上，智慧生命的形成和进化跟地球文明一样，那么行星诞生几十亿年后自然而然就会出现生命。银河系至少存在36个与地球文明类似的活跃的、具有交流能力的外星文明。根据计算机模拟显示，这36个外星文明与地球的平均距离为1.7万光年。这意味着如果我们现在发送消息给他们，他们需要1.7万年后才能收到并回复。考虑到消息来回需要一定时间，整个交流过程可能需要3.4万年。


实际上，如果在地球上发现外星文明存在的证据，对地球文明来说恐怕不是个好事情。


史蒂芬·霍金认为，人类与外星生物接触存在着巨大的风险，若外星人出现在地球，即意味着他们掌握了能够穿过太空的技术，他们的军事技术将远远超过人类，人类的任何抵御都将毫无效果，这可能使地球沦为殖民地，这种事情一旦出现会给人类带来极大的风险，人类应该采取一切可能的措施，避免与外星人接触。]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[我使用开源的 XFS 文件系统是为了其扩展属性带来的小小便利。扩展属性是一种为我的数据添加上下文的独特方式。


“文件系统” 是一个描述你的计算机怎样跟踪你创建的所有文件的完美词语。你的计算机存储有大量的数据，无论是文档、配置文件还是数以千计的照片。这需要一种对人和机器都友好的方式。诸如 Ext4、XFS、JFS、BtrFS 的文件系统是你的计算机用来跟踪文件的“语言”。

你的桌面或终端可以帮助你快速查找文件。例如，你的文件管理器可能有过滤功能，以便让你可以快速查看家目录内的图片，它也可能带有搜索功能以让你使用文件名定位文件。这些特性被称作文件属性，正如其名，它们是由文件头或者文件系统代码定义的文件对象的属性。大多数的文件系统记录了标准的文件属性，例如文件名、文件大小、文件类型、创建时间、上次访问时间等。

我在我的计算机上使用开源的 XFS 文件系统，不是为了其稳定性和高性能，而是为了其扩展属性带来的小小便利。

常见的文件属性

当你保存一个文件，文件相关的数据也会随同保存。常见的属性会告诉操作系统是否更新访问时间，什么时间同步数据到硬盘等逻辑细节。哪些属性被保存取决于底层文件系统的功能和特性。

在标准文件属性（如果有标准属性的话）之外，XFS、Ext4 和 BtrFS 文件系统都可以使用扩展属性。

扩展属性

XFS、Ext4 和 BtrFs 允许你创建自己的任意文件属性。由于是自己创建的，操作系统不会有内建支持，不过我以“标签”的方式使用它们，就像图片的 EXIF 数据一样。开发者们也许会选择使用扩展属性去开发应用内的自定义的功能。

XFS 中的属性有两个“命名空间”：用户（user）和根（root）。当创建属性时，你必须将其加入其中一个命名空间。要将属性添加到根命名空间，必须使用 sudo 命令或以 root 身份登录。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Everything about GTK is great. Especially Glib-2.0. But GNOME's temu is just something else. It's really robust and very nice. I spend 99% of my time on the terminal emulator, the only other 'GUI' apps that I use are Firefox and Evince. I have tried several other temus, but GNOME temu is the best out there.

 What is your favorite temu? If it's not GNOME, it's an invalid statement.

After figuring out how things work and getting used to terminal being main tool I just don't want to go back to windows. I decided to reinstall it to get my windows ssd into ACHI mode and decided that I will keep windows only for games. I used Manjaro for like... 3-4 days but I think that I will stick to it. Maybe even move to Arch if I will decide that my sanity is no longer needed

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In the Phoronix comments section, some people pointed out that it was some old Nvidia driver version that seemed to use the GPL symbols and not work anymore with the most recent kernel version. Apparently, some guy has tested it and it seems the latest drivers work just fine.
 While I'm really happy for that, I worry about older drivers. RPMFusion, for example, has the drivers 340, 390 and 470, as well as the 535. The AUR has the 340, 390, 470, 525 and 535.
 I worry what will happen to the users of old, unsupported Nvidia cards.

 I like all three major operating systems.
  
 Back in the days, I used macOS during most of university. It's a great operating system that just works. Sometimes you feel a bit restricted and you find yourself in front of a paywall but other than that, the overall experience is really good.
  
 Due to gaming, I've always had a PC running Windows (XP, Vista, 7, 10). I'd say that it's still the best (in terms of "uncomplicated") operating system when it comes to gaming. Often times it feels less restrictive than macOS and then again… it's very similar.
  
 A few years ago, I installed Ubuntu on my laptop (T480s). It was kinda meh and I decided to try every single distro "in the top ratings". After a week, I already had Ubuntu, Linux Mint, Pop!_OS, Fedora, Manjaro, Endeavour…]]></summary>

(SFC) has announced
the availability of videos from the
first-ever Free and Open Source Yearly
(FOSSY) conference, which was held in July in Portland, Oregon in the US.

During the four days of the conference, there were a wide variety of talks
from speakers with a range of experience and backgrounds, and amazing
community focused discussions. Featuring wide ranging topics such as a panel
discussion about software coops, what
is life like without a smartphone (where the picture on the right is
from), and thinking
about FOSS from a systems theory perspective. Our track organizers
brought together communities from all over, and led by example choosing
speakers, topics and setting up panels for important conversations. There
is definitely a talk that will interest you, whether you are interested
in nonprofit
board structure, an
introduction to Reproducible

 edit Ok. I might have been wrong. My /usr/local ist empty. If stuff only gets installed there, my argument is invalid. I still feel pretty insecure about doing a make install, because it at least could conflict with the system installation.
 Thanks for answering. /edit
 I have a folder ~/usr where I push all compiled stuff. I then do cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=$HOME/usr/ or ./configure --prefix ... and then install that without sudo. Some big projects I compile even have their own prefix.
 Sure you have to tell your users to have ~/usr/bin in your PATH. I also added that to my LD_LIBRARY_PATH and PKG_CONFIG_PATH. But IMO that should be a default thing to do for Linux users (who compile stuff).
 Polluting your distro installation with random crap is a sure way to get issues later. Its far worse then anything you can do to install Software on Windows.
 I mean compiling a bleeding edge kicad, inkscape or jpeg-xl is easy. But will probably trash your system if you already have an older version installed.
 (Some projects tell you to build a distro package and sudo install that. Much better, but I still prefer having the binaries in my own prefix. Also a lot got better, since many big projects publish daily snapshots as Appimage or similar.)
 edit2 I was of course talking about a single-user system for users who sometimes like to test bleeding edge software. Not Multi-user sytems. Not Grandma, who's not allowed to install stuff. edit

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The DualSense (PS5 controller) driver reports the analog triggers (L2, R2) as ABS_Z and ABS_RZ (link to source).
 From what I can tell, this goes against the Linux Gamepad Specification:
  
Lower trigger buttons are reported as BTN_TR2 or ABS_HAT2X (right/ZR) and BTN_TL2 or ABS_HAT2Y (left/ZL)
  
I feel like I should report it somehow. Does this warrant sending a bug report to the maintainer? Seems a bit heavy to call it a bug, I dunno
 EDIT: I did some digging, and found that xpad reported the triggers as Z-axes since the start. The spec was written way later, specifically because all gamepads did their own thing. My assumption is that xpad has been used as inspiration for other drivers, leading to this confusion. xone, which aims to be a replacement for xpad, still reports the triggers as Z-axes.
 EDIT 2: I've done further digging, searching for discussions in the mailing list. Shit's crazy, there's over a decade of headaches. Like how apparently, the R in e.g. ABS_RX doesn't mean right axes at all. ABS_X was units/mm, whereas ABS_RX was units/radian. And it's the same guy, Roderick Colenbrander, trying to disentangle the snakes, too! I'd love to hear back from him, I bet he has some crazy stories about compatibility.

多年来，Unity 引擎以其免版税的授权结构赢得了大大小小开发商的好感，这意味着开发商无需根据游戏的销售情况支付额外费用。Unity 于本周二宣布了新的收费结构，在达到一定的最低门槛后，将开始按安装次数向开发者收费，每次安装费用甚至可以高达 0.20 美元，让这种好感被抛到了九霄云外。开发者们的反应非常迅速，可以说是群情激愤。新的 Unity 费用结构将于明年生效，将根据公司的不同订阅层级收取不同的每安装费用。甚至，新的收费结构将适用于以前存在的 Unity 游戏。之前，Unity 允许月收入低于 10 万美元的开发者完全免费使用，其 CEO 在 2015 年推出免费的个人版时说，“我们不会敷衍用户，也不会向他们收取版税。我们说免费，就是免费。”

Ubuntu 23.10 安装程序恢复对 ZFS 文件系统的支持

在基于 Flutter 的新版 Ubuntu Linux 桌面安装程序里，缺少了对 ZFS 根文件系统安装的支持。但最近在即将推出的 Ubuntu 23.10 中，他们恢复了对 ZFS 的“实验性”支持（包括在 subiquity 和桌面安装程序中），但尚不支持 ZFS 加密。由于 OpenZFS 内核驱动程序仍在 Linux 内核主树之外，使用 ZFS 可能面临一定的风险。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[关于林徽因的设计作品，时贤已有论述，如曹汛《林徽音先生年谱》（北京出版集团、文津出版社2022年7月版）、李传玺《林徽因设计的封面与刊头》（《中华读书报》2022年12月7日第5版）。两位学者提到，林徽因除了测绘建筑图外，还曾为多种杂志设计封面，为报纸设计刊头等。
笔者最近在《燕大·一九三六》中，发现了林徽因的两幅“分栏画”。其中一张还是当时的燕京大学风景。
所谓“分栏画”，指的是为栏目作分隔的画。《燕大·一九三六》是燕京大学一九三六届本科同学毕业纪念册。该刊共分校景、毕业生、团体、生活、体育、文艺、广告七个栏目。林徽因作的两幅画分别冠于“校景”“生活”栏目之前。

在“校景”栏之前的画，描述的是燕园风景。左下角边栏处署名“徽因”。画中包括一座塔，一座小桥，两栋中式建筑。图中间偏左一点的塔状建筑物是博雅塔，建于1924年，是一座水塔。博雅塔旁边有两座中式建筑，很可能是贝公楼（即现在的北京大学办公楼）和宁德楼。宁德楼（Ninde Hall）1922年建成，是燕京大学第一座建筑，燕京大学宗教学院所在地。宁德楼的二层设有小礼拜堂，经常用来举办宗教活动以及演讲等。宁德楼现称民主楼，为北大外语学院办公场所。贝公楼（Bashford Hall）1926年建成，是燕京大学的主楼，为纪念汇文大学第二任校长贝施德（又译贝施福，James White Bashford）而建，现为北京大学办公楼。画面右侧的小桥是校友桥（位于现在的北大西门入口处）。
综上，该图中包含了博雅塔、校友桥、贝公楼和宁德楼的风景，还点缀了很多植物如大树等等，用在“校景”栏前名副其实。

在“生活”栏前的画，是两位穿旗袍的女子在森林里游玩。画面左侧女子的手臂搭在右侧女子肩上，头微侧，赤足，双足提起，似在舞蹈，似在走路；右侧女子的脸似是给树叶挡住了，或者戴着面具，很有神秘感，身形婀娜多姿。两位女子手互相搭在肩头，四周有很多树…]]></summary>

自从涂鸦和街头艺术诞生之日起，人们一直提出各种问题，例如涂鸦是一种犯罪行为吗？它称得上是艺术吗？它们的创作者通常是什么人？为了什么目的？稍微愿意多思考一下的人还会继续追问：“涂鸦”与“街头艺术”的概念和内涵是什么？在城市文化中，它们具有何种意义和价值？它们的发展与演变过程说明了什么问题？如何从学术的视角来观察和研究街头艺术？从我阅读过的几本涂鸦艺术画册和相关著述来说，英国艺术评论家西蒙·阿姆斯特朗（Simon Armstrong）的《街头艺术》（Street Art，2019）虽然只有十万字左右的篇幅，但却是关于涂鸦和街头艺术的较有系统性的著述，在脉络清晰、简明扼要的叙事中不乏与亚文化相关的艺术社会学、政治学、法学等面向的思考。
涂鸦与街头艺术在艺术史主流叙事中难免要被冷落，只有在专门关注西方社会抗议政治的那些艺术著述中，街头艺术的发生背景、视觉意义、传播方式以及抗争遭遇才能得到关注。在利兹·麦奎斯特（Liz McQuiston）的《抗议！——社会与政治抗议的图像史》（Protest!——A History of Social and Political Protest Graphics， Princeton University Press，2019）中，涂鸦艺术与版画、漫画、海报、壁画等图像、图形一起表达对西方社会与政治的不满和抗议。不难想象的是，作者当然不是仅仅埋头在图书馆或美术馆展厅，“我参与社会运动已经有多年了，我永远不会放弃”。这是她在网络上的宣言，与那些永远不停止行为的涂鸦写手相似。激进艺术家尼古拉斯·兰伯特（Nicolas Lampert）的《美国人民艺术史：250年的行动主义艺术家和艺术家在社会正义运动中的工作》（A People s Art H…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[无论如何，保持谨慎总是上策！


对于 Linux 的恶意软件，我们并不常提及，这是因为它常会被迅速修复，并且与 Windows/macOS 相比，在现实中被利用的情况相对较少。

然而，一款颇受欢迎的跨平台下载管理器 Free Download Manager，最近引起了一些关注。

虽然在我们的 下载管理器列表 中，并未将其列为 Linux 的推荐选项，但我们的一些读者以及我自己在过去的 Windows 使用体验中，都曾选择了它。

那么，问题来了，这究竟是怎么回事？

伪装成 Linux 版 Free Download Manager 的恶意软件

Free Download Manager 本身并非恶意软件。但问题在于，研究人员发现了一个恶意 Linux 程序包，而这个包，正是假冒 Free Download Manager 的。

安全研究公司卡巴斯基的研究员们 发现，这个恶意程序包已经存在了至少两年（2020-2022年）的时间，而在此期间，大部分使用者并未意识到他们所安装的软件包，含有恶意组件。

许多恶意程序包都试图伪装成市场上受欢迎的程序；那么，这件事究竟是怎么回事呢？

问题的核心在于：这个恶意程序包是通过 Free Download Manager 的官方网站 😱 和其他非官方渠道分发的，一直持续到 2022 年。


🚧 Free Download Manager 的官方网站是 freedownloadmanager.org，正式的下载 URL 是 files2.freedownloadmanager.org。


而恶意程序包下载的域名是 deb.fdmpkg.org。

换言之，这表明开发者并未察觉其官方网站已被恶意破坏，用户已被重定向，下载安装来自另一个域名的带有恶意的 Linux 程序包。

需要注意的是：并非所有用户在 2020 年至 2022 年期间，都被从官方网站重定向，下载了恶意程序包。然而，这并不能让情况改观，对吧？

你可能下载了，也可能没有下载安装过这个具有感染性的程序包 😕

这个恶意软件究竟干了什么 🤖

卡巴斯基的报告在描述这个恶意软件时，称其为 “一种 bash 窃取器”，这种窃取器可以收集系统信息、浏览记录、已保存的密码、加密货币钱包的文件，以及云服务的凭据，包括 AWS、Google Cloud、Oracle Cloud Infrastructure 以及 Azure 等。

考虑到在现实世界中很少看到 Linux 版的恶意软件，因此验证你下载工具的来源和可靠程度是至关重要的，这需要你始终保持谨慎态度。

尽管我们并未明确了解有多少的 Linux 用户习惯使用 Free Download Manager，但这的确是令人警惕的新闻。你应当遵循所有 提高隐私保护的建议，确保你的在线体验安全无忧。

现在，你应该怎么做？

在软件的开发者就此问题做出正式公开回应之前，我会建议你转而使用其他下载管理器：


6 个最好的 Linux 下载管理器


如果你不记得（或无法确认你下载源的准确位置），我会建议你移除该下载管理器。

另外，我建议你阅读卡巴斯基发表的 研究报告，找出可能的系统遭受损害的迹象。如果你的系统中存在相同的文件路径，且 Debian 程序包的恶意校验和与之相吻合，那么你应该手动移除它们。

即使你想要重新下载该软件，在安装包到你的 Linux 系统之前，你也必须核对下载 URL 的准确性。

💬 你如何看待 Linux 用户如何保护自己避免受到恶意软件的攻击？欢迎在评论中留言分享你的想法。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Marginally prefer Gnome because it gets out of the way and everything is seamless. KDE is so much fun though and it's apps are so pretty. 
 I sat through a one hour presentation at work from a Dev telling us how to use WSL, omg how do these people even live? Install V1, upgrade to V2 just flat didn't work. The CLI help text is wrong (!!) and doesn't work and they tell me with a straight face that "oh yeah it needs you to do [goat sacrifice] to make it work. I'm sure it suits Microsoft to make it work but not easily.
 Meanwhile my home PC is an implacable mountain of computing awesomeness. The kids love their little cheap old ThinkPad Ubuntu laptops. There's never a time that I think oh I wish I was locked in to Apple's crappy ecosystem, or the horror of windows and it's mess and junk.
 And then at work they pay me way more because I'm a web dev who knows how to read logs, write bash scripts and configure build pipelines. Knowledge I got for free with a bit of fun tinkering. 
 But noooo, the other people at work, software developers mind you, people who should be interested in computers. Curious about them. They want Macs because.. I don't know? I guess the physical hardware and case is nice? What a waste of money though! And they can't confidently answer even basic questions about how to start a service or install a package. Homebrew is a joke and apparently windows devs have Chocolatey which is embarrassing to even say the name of.
 Amazing all these posts from people wandering in aimlessly with "I tried Linux but there was an error and I didn't read it or try anything and DAE think maybe lol just why can't we all use macs?".

Exposures" (CVE) system was launched late 
in the previous century (September 1999) to track vulnerabilities in
software.  Over the years since, it has had a somewhat checkered
reputation, along with some some attempts to
replace it, but CVE numbers are still the only effective way to track
vulnerabilities.  While that can certainly be useful, the
CVE-assignment (and severity scoring) process is not without its problems.
The prominence of CVE numbers, and the consequent increase in 
"reputation" for a reporter, have combined to create a system that can
be—and is—actively gamed.  Meanwhile, the organizations that oversee the
system are ultimately not doing a particularly stellar job.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[这篇文章是《Btrfs 详解》系列文章中的一篇。从 Fedora Linux 33 开始，Btrfs 就是 Fedora Workstation 和 Fedora Silverblue 的默认文件系统。

介绍

文件系统是现代计算机的基础之一。它是任何操作系统必不可少的一部分，且通常不为人注意。但是，像 Btrfs 这样的现代文件系统提供了许多很棒的特性，使计算机的使用更加方便。例如，它可以无感地为你压缩文件，或者为增量备份建立可靠的基础。

这篇文章将带你高屋建瓴地了解 Btrfs 文件系统是如何工作的，有什么特性。本文既不会过多涉及技术细节，也不会研究其底层实现，系列后续的文章会详细介绍一些重要特性。

什么是文件系统

如果你基本了解过文件系统是如何工作的，那么下面的内容对你应该是不陌生的，你可以直接跳到下一节。否则，请先阅读下面对文件系统的简短介绍。

简单来说，文件系统允许你的 PC 去寻找存储在磁盘上的数据。这听起来像是微不足道的工作，但实际上时至今日各种类型的非易失性存储设备（比如机械硬盘、固态硬盘、SD 卡等等）仍然与 1970 年代 PC 被发明时基本相同：一个（巨大的）存储块集合。

“块Block” 是最小的可寻址存储单元。PC 上的每个文件内容被存储在多个块中。一个块通常是 4096 字节的大小。这取决于你的硬件和在这之上的软件（即文件系统）。

文件系统允许我们从海量的存储块中查找文件的内容，这是通过所谓的 inode 去实现的。一个 inode 在特殊格式的存储块里记录了文件的信息。这包含文件的大小，哪里去寻找组成文件内容的存储块，访问规则（即谁可读，可写，可执行）等等。

下面是 inode 的示意图：



inode 的结构对文件系统的功能有巨大的影响，因此它是各种文件系统诸多的重要数据结构之一。出于这个原因，每个文…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[今日，苹果举办发布会，正式推出了包括iPhone 15系列和Apple Watch Series 9 / Ultra 2在内的多款产品，其售价从1999元到13999元不等。其中iPhone 15 Pro/15 Pro Max的最大亮点也是芯片，其搭载的A17 Pro 芯片，也是业界首款 3 nm芯片。集成了 190 亿颗晶体管，晶体管间仅有 12 个硅原子宽度的缝隙，内置六核 CPU的性能是 A16 Bionic 的两倍，而效率则高达四倍。


作为对比，A15 有 150 亿个晶体管，A14有118 亿个晶体管 ， A13 有 85 亿个晶体管。


A17 Pro 内置的16 核神经引擎，运行速度比上代快 2 倍，每秒可处理多达 35 万亿次运算，能够在设备上实现机器学习。额外的速度可以让 iPhone 上处理更多的机器学习事务，从而使您的个人数据远离云端。它支持更准确的自动更正、模糊肖像照片中的背景、为失语者创建个人声音等功能。对于游戏玩家来说，它有助于为新的 MetalFX 技术提供动力，该技术可以增加视频游戏图形细节，而不会像提高分辨率那样严重消耗电池电量。


A17 Pro 还拥有专门用于 iPhone 15 Pro 功能（例如 ProRes 视频格式）的专用引擎。它增加了对较新的 AV1 视频格式的支持，这应该会提高使用该格式的 YouTube 等视频网站的效率。此外，还搭载了 iPhone ProMotion 和常亮显示屏的引擎。


A17 Pro 内置的六核 GPU，采用了苹果专门设计的着色器架构，号称是苹果 GPU 历史上最大的一次重新设计，其专注于性能和效率，支持运行复杂应用软件和全新渲染功能。得益于全新设计，苹果GPU速度提高了 20%，同时也更加节能，可在游戏时保持持续性能。而且，A17 Pro 首次具有硬件加速光线追踪功能，…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[无人察觉：窃取密码的 Linux 木马已偷偷下载 3 年

安全研究人员报告，一个下载网站间隔性地向 Linux 用户提供恶意软件，盗取密码和其他敏感信息长达三年多，直到最后销声匿迹。该网站提供了一个名为 “免费下载管理器“ 的 Linux 软件。从 2020 年开始，该网站有时会将用户重定向到另外一个恶意域名，提供该应用的恶意版本，它会在目标设备上安装后门。该后门会窃取包括系统信息、浏览历史、保存的密码、加密货币钱包文件以及云服务凭证等信息。这个恶意重定向于 2022 年结束，原因不明。


消息来源：Ars Technica



老王点评：与 Windows 相比，Linux 恶意软件很少被发现，这往往让人们更加掉以轻心，现在检查一下你的 Linux 桌面，或许为时不晚。




谷歌称它的搜索引擎是最好的

在周二开庭的谷歌反垄断诉讼案上，司法部和来自美国各州和地区的 52 位总检察长指控谷歌支付数十亿美元，以换取被设置为手机和网络浏览器的默认搜索引擎，从而非法维持其垄断地位。法官称，谷歌至少在 2010 年就已成为垄断企业，如今控制着超过 89% 的在线搜索市场。谷歌的律师表示，人们选择谷歌作为浏览器和智能手机的默认搜索引擎“是因为谷歌为他们带来了价值，而不是因为他们不得不使用谷歌”。并举例，微软在 Windows 上的默认搜索引擎是必应，但用户切换到谷歌是因为它是搜索市场上更好的产品。而且，谷歌的律师表示，Safari 和 Firefox 通过默认搜索引擎交易换取收入分成，帮助了它们的创新。


消息来源：彭博社



老王点评：谷歌是不是最好的，和它是不是非法维持垄断没有关系。让我们看看这起新时代的 IT 巨头垄断案将如何走向。




OpenSSL 1.1.1 已经走到了生命的尽头

OpenSSL 1.1.1 最初于 2018 年作为开源安全通信库的长期支持版本发布。当时，其背后的团队宣称，该版本将至少支持五年，也就是到今年。要想继续获得 OpenSSL 的支持，就必须升级到 OpenSSL 3.0 LTS 或最新的 3.1 版本。但迁移到更高版本的 OpenSSL 会带来风险和危险，一些依赖 OpenSSL 的服务可能会对更新反应迟钝，尤其是那些硬编码 OpenSSL 服务的物联网组件。实际上，企业宁可花钱让 OpenSSL 维护者和作者继续使用发霉的旧代码，比如，可以购买一份针对企业的价值 5 万美元的年度支持合同。


消息来源：The Register



老王点评：作为一个安全基础组件，这么干净利索的停止服务支持，总是有些不负责任。]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So I have noticed a vast amount of non-computer science engineering software that are industry standards ain't available on Linux. Here are some of them that I know of:
  
Autodesk civil engineering suite
 Solidworks
 Aspen chemical industry suite
 AtRisk suite
 Quintic Biomechanics suite
  
However, there some softwares that are available on Linux. The paid (enterprise) version of these software are available on Linux, student version needs Windows.
 They use custom GUI installer and installs with decentralised dependencies (Windows style). In short, they are not using your package manager, flatpak, snaps or appimages. You can specify installation directory just like Windows. Most of them don't work on Wayland.
  
Altair hyperworks suite
 ANSYS: I use it personally. 56GB full size.
 Matlab
 Hexagon MSc suite (nastran, patran)
 Bentley engineering suite (ADINA and Staad): It has caveman style UI.
  
These companies don't want to put their binaries on the distro repos nor they want to use any of our container formats such flatpak etc. What are the challenges that these company face in order to follow the recommeded way of distributing softwares? Or in other words, why don't they leverage the central dependency?
 May be they are not comfortable with package mangers because it is distro specific, so why not use containers like flatpaks or snaps? Is there a flaw in our software distribution system?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[乔姆斯基对语言学、计算机科学、认知科学和哲学有深刻贡献，同时他也是在世的最有影响力的知识分子之一。有人说他位列有史以来引用数最高的十位思想者，这话即使不完全准确，应该也很接近。用Google Ngram查一下：他的名声和维特根斯坦差不多，高于波普尔、托尔斯泰、图灵和哥德尔，但逊于罗素，更不要说爱因斯坦、牛顿和希腊三贤。

ChatGPT 2022年底横空出世。2023年3月8日，近九十五岁的乔姆斯基应《纽约时报》之邀发表文章：The False Promise of ChatGPT，如文题所示，乔姆斯基对ChatGPT不买账。文中用了一个几乎在他老人家所有著作中都出现过的例句：John is too stubborn to talk to。乔姆斯基认为机器会把这个句子理解为：John太固执不愿意和人谈话；而不会正确地理解其本意：John不可理喻。但网民们把这个例句丢给ChatGPT：ChatGPT准确地知道这个句子的深层含义。乔姆斯基被打了脸。乔姆斯基对他年轻时代的新兴学科如计算机科学和认知科学的前沿成果了如指掌，但对大语言模型却持忽视态度。斯坦福大学的计算语言学家克里斯·曼宁（Chris Manning）在推文中说：“看到一位年轻时深刻的创新者，现在却保守地阻碍激动人心的新方法，真是令人悲伤。”这大概也是崇拜过乔姆斯基的两代人的普遍失望：乔老爷老了。当然，期盼年过九旬的乔姆斯基亲手微调大语言模型，是不公平的。
乔姆斯基其人
乔姆斯基的父母和那时大多数犹太人一样都是复国主义者，同时有强烈的不自私的社会主义色彩。作为左派犹太家庭的孩子，乔姆斯基十二岁就涉足政治，他的政治态度受他老师哈里斯的影响，不信布尔什维克，也反犹太复国主义。乔姆斯基刚结婚时曾考虑到迁居以色列，反讽的是，他出名后因为反犹立场，被以色列拒绝签证。他1960年代因参与反越战活动，曾被美国政府关押。他的同牢房狱友…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[展望未来，Ubuntu 将允许你利用 TPM 支持的全磁盘加密。但是，这是你想要的吗？


Ubuntu 23.10 每日构建不断增加令人兴奋的新功能！

早些时候，我们介绍了 主要的 PPA 变化 和新的 基于 Flutter 的商店（也随最新的每日构建一起发布）。

现在，我们又看到了另一项重大更改，通过更改用户处理磁盘加密的方式（如果启用），增强 Ubuntu 系统的安全性。

该功能的初始支持将在 Ubuntu 23.10 中提供，并将在未来的 Ubuntu 版本中得到改进。

Ubuntu 23.10：TPM 支持的全磁盘加密



TPM 支持的全磁盘加密Full Disk Encryption（FDE）作为一项实验性功能引入，是 Ubuntu 过去 15 年处理 FDE 方式的重大变化。

在现有系统中，采用了密码机制，该机制将通过接受用户设置的密码来对用户进行身份验证，然后使用该密码提供对磁盘的访问。

所有这一切都是由于集成了 Linux 统一密钥设置Linux Unified Key Setup（LUKS）框架而成为可能，该框架在块级别处理磁盘加密。

使用 TPM 支持的系统，主板上的 TPM 芯片将用于提供全磁盘加密，而无需密码。

芯片将处理锁定完整 EFI 状态的密钥 以及内核命令行的解密。只有当设备使用已定义为“授权”来访问机密数据的软件启动时，才有可能实现这一点。


📋 TPM 可信平台模块Trusted Platform Module 的缩写。


但是，有一个问题。

TPM 支持的 FDE 基于与 Ubuntu Core 相同的架构，这导致了许多关键组件的共享，这些组件 以 Snap 包的形式提供。因此，引导加载程序（shim/GRUB）和内核文件等内容是通过 Snap 交付的。

幸运的是，这种新的 TPM 支持的 FDE 并不是加密磁盘的唯一方法。对于那些不想使用新系统的人来说，传统密码系统仍将存在。

用户还可以使用新系统和密码来进一步增强安全性。

有关 TPM 支持的磁盘加密如何工作的技术细节，我建议你阅读 Ubuntu 的官方博客。

有兴趣测试一下吗？ 🤔


🚧 测试任何实验功能都可能导致全部数据丢失。因此，请自行承担风险。


好吧，TPM 支持的 FDE 已推出到 Ubuntu 23.10 的 每日构建 中，你只需在安装过程中进行设置，如本文中的截图所示。

在 Ubuntu 安装程序中选择安装类型时，可在“高级功能”下使用新的 FDE 选项。

💬 你对这个新的实验性功能有何看法？ 在下面的评论中分享你的想法。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[以下是确保 Windows 系统已准备好运行虚拟机的必要条件。


在 VirtualBox 中看到了“无法打开虚拟机会话failed to open a session for the virtual machine”错误？

你的系统上可能没有启用虚拟化。

这是在 Windows 系统上创建虚拟机所需执行的几件事之一。

简单来说，你需要了解：


在你的 PC 上启用虚拟化支持

使用虚拟机程序创建/管理虚拟机

确保某些系统资源要求以无缝使用虚拟机


下面是第一件事：

在 Windows PC 上启用虚拟化

如果你的系统预装了 Windows 10/11，那么你很可能已经启用了虚拟化。你不需要额外的设置。

但如果你在系统上手动安装了 Windows，那么可能需要检查 BIOS 设置以查看它是否支持虚拟化。如果禁用，虚拟机程序将无法运行并给出错误。

这是使用 VirtualBox 程序时出现的错误：



你怎么能这么做呢？ 以下是基本步骤：




前往 UEFI 固件设置（或 BIOS 菜单）。你通常可以通过按 Del 按钮或 F1、F2、F10 或 F12 来访问它。

根据主板制造商的不同，用户界面会有所不同。但是，在大多数情况下，你必须进入到其中的“高级Advance”选项，并访问“CPU 配置CPU Configuration”设置。

在 CPU 配置中，你必须启用 “Intel (VMX) Virtualization Technology” 或 “SVM Mode”（适用于 AMD 处理器）。


下一步是什么？ 考虑到你已经启用了虚拟化支持，你需要使用 虚拟化程序 来帮助你完成工作。

使用虚拟化程序

你可以选择第三方应用以方便使用，也可以选择使用 Windows 自带的 Hyper…]]></summary>

 I've been using Linux for several years now and I've more or less come to terms with the fact that the hotkeys on my mouse and keyboard will remain unconfigured, especially because the latter needed this piece of software running constantly in order to work.
 Since years have gone by: How are things going? Is it still the case that the best thing you can do is just configure the devices that save the config hardware-locally on windows and live with the rest?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[DISCLAIMER: I know many of you in this sub already know this. My post is for those who aren’t familiar with Ventoy yet.
 I’m a Linux fanboy, and I’ve made the switch from Windows since a few months only. And as many of you probably did at some point, I ended up distro hopping to « try them all ». I was happy, unfortunately my USB drive wasn’t: constant flashing and partition rearrangements killed it. My fault (carelessness and poor use of partitioning) and my drive was s*** anyway.
 In retrospect, I believe that flashing the drive on a regular basis isn’t a good idea. And it just isn’t practical and is overhaul annoying.
 Now I’m using Ventoy (free and open source) and it just makes much more sense: I flash my drive once and I’m all set forever. I can even update Ventoy on the fly should that be necessary. It creates a hidden bootable partition on the drive, and a main partition where I can dump all the .iso I want on my USB key. I can then boot to whichever iso is on my drive. Just read/write process and no constant partitioning mean little strain on my drive. Plus I can easily try out several distro on a machine if needed and I have a live CD iso of Gparted in there just in case.
 I’m posting this out for those that wouldn’t know about it, hoping it’ll make distro hopping much more enjoyable as it did for me. Cheers and happy Linuxing.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The GCC stack-protector feature detects stack-based buffer overruns by
putting a canary value on the stack and noticing if that value is changed.
It
turns out, though, that dynamically allocated local variables (such as
variable-length arrays and space obtained with alloca()) are
placed beyond the canary, so overflows of those variables will not be
detected.  As a result, arm64 binaries built with vulnerable versions of
GCC are not as protected as they should be and need to be rebuilt.


	Dynamic allocations are just as susceptible to overflows as other
	locals. In fact, they're arguably more susceptible because they're
	almost always arrays, whereas fixed locals are often integers,
	pointers, or other types to which variable-length data is never
	written. GCC's own heuristics for when to use a stack guard reflect
	this.


Kees Cook, meanwhile, has pointed out that
the kernel no longer uses variable-length arrays, so kernel builds should
not be affected by this vulnerability.]]></summary>

Starting in 2020, the same domain at times redirected users to the domain deb.fdmpkg[.]org, which served a malicious version of the app. The version available on the malicious domain contained a script that downloaded two executable files to the /var/tmp/crond and /var/tmp/bs file paths. The script then used the cron job scheduler to cause the file at /var/tmp/crond to launch every 10 minutes. With that, devices that had installed the booby-trapped version of Free Download Manager were permanently backdoored.]]></summary>

I've been playing around with fine-tuning models for a couple of years, and wanted to share some insights and practical code. I’ve condensed what I’ve learned into a small set of notebooks at https://github.com/OpenPipe/OpenPipe/tree/main/examples/clas..., covering labeling data, fine-tuning, running efficient inference, and evaluating costs/performance. The 7B model we train here matches GPT-4’s labels 95% of the time on the test set, and for the 5% of cases where they disagree it’s often because the correct answer is genuinely ambiguous.
What is fine-tuning? You can think of it as a more-powerful form of prompting, where instead of writin…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[微软将取消 Windows 中的第三方打印机驱动程序

微软计划于 2027 年取消 Windows 中的第三方打印机驱动程序。这样做的部分原因是，Mopria 联盟为打印机提供了通用标准。该联盟由多家打印机厂商于 2013 年成立。从 Windows 10 21H2 开始，微软就在其操作系统中加入了对 Mopria 的支持，借助微软 IPP 类驱动程序，可支持通过网络或 USB 连接的设备。微软表示：“这样一来，打印设备制造商就无需提供自己的安装程序、驱动程序、实用程序等”。


消息来源：The Register



老王点评：这种通用外设标准化是一件好事。除了一些非常老旧的打印机，应该没什么影响。




获得艺术大奖的著名 AI 绘画未能获得版权

还记得那副获得 2022 年科罗拉多州博览会年度美术竞赛的《空间歌剧院Théâtre d'Opéra Spatial》的 AI 绘画吗？它是艺术家使用 MidJourney AI 生成的，以其复古的笔触细腻的色彩，意外地赢得了艺术创作比赛的第一名。这件事引发了公众对 AI 绘画和 MidJourney 的极大兴趣。不出意外，美国版权局也拒绝了对该作品的版权授予，“因为它不是人类创作的产物……其中包含的人工智能创作素材超过了最低限度”。使用 MidJourney 创作这幅画的 Jason Allen 告诉版权局，他使用 Midjourney “输入了大量修改和文本提示，至少 624 次，才得到了图片的初始版本”，并用 Photoshop 对其进行了修改。


消息来源：路透社



老王点评：不授予版权有不授予的道理，我认为 AI 制品应该有不同于现有版权范围的新的版权认定。




微软决定由它来选择你使用的安全登录方式

微软本周将推出多因素身份验证（MFA）系统首选验证，它将为登录的个人选择最安全的方法，如果该方法不可用，则提供替代方法。Azure 活动目录会查看用户账户注册的身份验证方法，并选择最安全的途径。首选方法列表从临时访问通行证开始，然后依次是基于证书的身份验证、FIDO2 安全密钥、微软认证器的推送通知和基于时间的一次性密码（OTP），最后是手机。微软的总体目标是最终放弃使用用户名和密码作为身份验证方法，转而使用生物识别等其他方法。


消息来源：The Register



老王点评：总之，就是大家都习惯的密码是最不可靠的安全方式。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[按：1930年代初，在两位年轻的历史学家陈恭禄与萧一山之间，围绕后者所著《清代通史》下卷，以天津《大公报·文学副刊》为主战场，发生了一场旷日持久、异常激烈的“文字战”。当年（1932），陈恭禄三十三岁，为金陵大学历史系讲师，萧一山三十一岁，为南京中央大学教授。论战过后，后者搜罗各方辩论文章，辑成《〈清代通史〉下卷讲稿辨论集》（北平中华印书局1934年8月版），并特作一长序，从自身立场回顾“辩论”始末，从一开始得见陈文，“闻而色喜”，鉴于“讨论之责任”而“竭诚答之”，到无法忍受对方“强诬狡赖”，进而“痛心国难，疾首士风”，不得不“浪费笔墨，详函申辨”，透露心态的曲折变化。这一场以“学术批评”为导火线而引发的笔墨官司，此来彼往，步步升级，生动呈现了民国学界生态的复杂面相，文字锋芒背后，蕴含当时学人之基础素养及各自汲引的思想学术资源，公共媒体性质的大报副刊为“书评”所提供的发表空间也充满了张力。（详拙文《陈恭禄与萧一山笔战始末》，《南方周末》2023年8月4日）陈恭禄书评从“论历史方法与史料”（举例十余）、“论作者应有之态度 （举例凡三）、“指正书中错误”（举例凡十）、“指摘别字”（举例凡四）等四方面立论。最后一项，萧一山既诿责于“校对疏忽”，辩解说“印讲义作者均不校对，一委诸印刷局手民，故别字连篇也”，此处也不再赘。惟前三项兹事体大，质言之，包含了史法、史料、史观及史事考辨，荦荦大端，多关系“史学根本问题”者，与萧一山诸反论合观比勘，足资启发。窃以为“中国近代史学科”发轫期的学术派分、暗中竞逐，在陈、萧二氏笔战文字中多有透露，藉此可窥1930年代学界主流、非主流各派在纠葛中并进的多元学风。

The framerate is roughly the same and I'm experiencing lag spikes in CS:GO even at the lowest video settings. I've installed it with amdgpu-install --usecase=workstation,opencl --vulkan=pro and I'm sure that I'm using the proprietary drivers because of the output of glxinfo.
 Is this normal? Are AMD's proprietary drivers just that bad?
 Does anyone have any success stories with AMDGPU Pro?

        <id>https://linux.cn/article-16183-1.html?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss</id>
        <link href="https://linux.cn/article-16183-1.html?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss"/>
        <updated>2023-09-12T00:38:10.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Firefox 117 版本为即将到来的升级带来了必要的改进和新功能支持。


Firefox 是一款被许多人喜爱、却被少数人讨厌的浏览器。但是，作为基于 Chromium 的浏览器（例如 Chrome 和 Opera）的开源替代品，它不断发展以为其武器库添加新功能。

这一次，随着 Firefox 117 的发布，我们添加了一个有趣的附加功能，它已经准备了相当长一段时间了。

请允许我在本文中向你介绍这一点以及更多内容。让我们开始。

🆕 Firefox 117：有什么新变化？



与大多数 Firefox 版本一样，它也提供了很多功能。一些值得注意的亮点包括：


新的注重隐私的本地翻译功能（正在进行）。

将信用卡自动填充功能扩展到更多地区。

YouTube 视频列表现在可以使用屏幕阅读器正确滚动。


虽然功能听起来不错，但让我们关注翻译功能。

注重隐私的翻译

如上面的演示，Firefox 现在具有内置翻译工具。

它的主要卖点是所有语言翻译都在本地进行，无需将你的数据发送到任何服务器进行处理。

该功能本来已经存在于 Firefox 中，由名为 “Firefox Translations” 的附加组件提供。

但是，当时 在 Mozilla 对引擎代码库进行内部安全审查后，由于其第三方依赖性，放弃将其直接将其集成到 Firefox 中。

幸运的是，现在我们有了合适的原生功能。但是，有一个问题。


🚧 感谢 Ghack，我发现翻译功能在 Firefox 117 上默认处于禁用状态。他们计划逐步向用户推出该功能，并在下一个版本更新时默认禁用。


因此，为了测试它，我必须进入 about:config 手动启用它，然后在高级首选项中启用 browser.translations.enable 标志。



🛠️ 其他更改和改进

除此之外，还有一些值得注意的变化：


各种安全更新。

macOS 用户现在可以控制控件和链接的选项卡功能。

新的 CSS 兼容性工具提示增强了 Web 兼容性检查。（对网络开发人员有用）

一个新的首选项，允许禁用按 Shift+右键单击时出现的上下文菜单。


你可以浏览 发行说明 以更深入地了解此版本。

📥 获取 Mozilla Firefox 117

你可以从 FTP 门户 获取最新版本的 Firefox。如果尚未提供，它应该很快就会在 官方网站 上提供。


Mozilla Firefox 117


对于现有安装： 你可以通过在设置菜单中搜索“更新”，然后单击“检查更新”来更新它。

💬 你对 Firefox 117 新的自动翻译功能支持有何看法？ 在下面的评论中分享你的想法。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've been a software developer for almost 30 years. 
 I remember using VB back in the 90's and I was thinking about it the other day and it dawned on me; despite all the advances in technology since then, nothing I have found compares to that development experience today.  I would go so far as to say we've gone backwards in a big way.
Now, I'm no fan of Microsoft products but, I have yet to find a tool that can allow me to be as productive in so short a time as Visual Basic.  Yet I can't help wondering what problems it had that caused them to abandon it?  Moreover, why hasn't someone come out with a solid replacement?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[近日，李佳琦在直播活动中介绍79元一支的花西子眉笔时，网友在李佳琦直播间质疑商品定价贵，李佳琦怼网友说：“有的时候找找自己原因，这么多年了工资涨没涨，有没有认真工作？”此言一出，火速引起网友的热议。


9月11日凌晨1点，李佳琦就直播间怒怼网友一事发文致歉称：“深知大家的工作都是辛苦和不容易。说的话辜负了网友的期望，真的很抱歉。”


全文如下：



今天没有用“所有女生”开头，因为李佳琦让大家失望了，在看这条微博的所有人，对不起。


我刚刚结束今天的工作，昨天我在直播间回应产品评论时，说了些不恰当、让大家不舒服的话。今天工作的时候我也一直在反思，在回想，如果我是评论里的那位女生，会多失望啊。


我本就是一个彩妆柜台销售员，深知大家的工作都是辛苦和不容易的。我说的话辜负了你们的期望，真的很抱歉。之所以没有立马回应，是我想结束工作后认真地向评论里的那位女生道歉，任何人都可以对直播间的产品提出意见和想法。我作为主播应该一直带给大家积极的正能量，并学会控制情绪。


一路走来，我知道大家的信任才是直播间最重要的基础。我也希望一直保持最好的状态陪伴大家，我会认真倾听大家的建议，用心服务好所有的消费者。


再次说声对不起，诚恳接受大家的批评。    —李佳琦



李佳琦是一名知名美妆博主，因魔性的叫声和夸张的赞扬被网友称为“口红一哥”，他也是美腕（上海）网络科技有限公司合伙人。李佳琦曾于2018年9月成功挑战“30秒涂口红最多人数”的吉尼斯世界纪录，成为涂口红的世界纪录保持者。]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[人工智能正在大量“喝水”，你的每个问题都会用掉一瓶水

对人工智能工具的需求不断增长会带来高昂的成本，这不只是昂贵的半导体，还会增加数据中心的耗水量，因为所有这些计算都需要耗费大量电力并产生大量热量。OpenAI 的 ChatGPT 是在微软的数据中心训练的，这导致微软消耗了更多的冷却水。微软在其最新的环境报告中披露，从 2021 年到 2022 年，它的全球耗水量激增了 34%（达到近 17 亿加仑，超过 2500 个奥林匹克规格的游泳池）。有研究估计，每当你向 ChatGPT 提出 5 到 50 个提示或问题时，ChatGPT 会消耗 500 毫升的水来冷却。同期，谷歌的用水量也增长了 20%，这在很大程度上也归功于其人工智能工作。

老王点评：人工智能也需要不断补充水分才能跑啊。😉




2023 年顶级编程语言：Python 和 SQL

IEEE Spectrum 发布了第 10 届年度顶级编程语言排行榜。它从三个类别中各选出一种顶级语言：


光谱榜：在软件工程师使用最多的语言

职位榜：雇主需求量最大的语言

趋势榜：流行的语言


Python 在光谱榜（使用最多的语言）中保持第一，它已成为万金油语言，也是某些领域的高手，如人工智能领域。而在职位榜（雇主需求最多）中，SQL 排到了榜首，但具有讽刺意味的是，纯粹的 SQL 程序员是很难找到工作的。相反，雇主们喜欢看到 SQL 技能与其他语言的结合。而在趋势榜上，Python 仍然居首。


消息来源：IEEE



老王点评：Python 登顶并不意外，但是 SQL 能够登上工作需求排行榜首位，还是有点吃惊。所以，你知道该学习什么编程语言了吗？




Meta 计划训练与 GPT-4 相当的人工智能模型

Meta 公司已经购买了更多的英伟达 H100 人工智能训练芯片，以便不需要依赖微软的 Azure 云平台来训练新的聊天机器人。该公司计划在 2024 年初开始训练新的大型语言模型，目标似乎是传闻中 Meta 已经在开发的生成式人工智能功能的自然延伸，预计其功能将与 OpenAI 提供的最先进模型一样强大。据称，Instagram 正在测试一个拥有 30 种性格的聊天机器人，这听起来很像该公司本月即将推出的未公布的人工智能 “personas”。


消息来源：The Verge



老王点评：我比较看好 Meta 在 AI 方面的进展，尤其是他们使用伪开源打破 OpenAI 和谷歌的护城河的做法，颇有影响，虽然我腹诽他们的伪开源。]]></summary>

《安妮女王时代的英格兰》三部曲是著名历史学家乔治·麦考莱·屈威廉最具代表性的著作之一，英文版出版于二十世纪三十年代，中译本自2023年开始由中国法制出版社陆续出版，现已出第一卷《布伦海姆战役》。
G.M.屈威廉的学术生平
G.M.屈威廉全名乔治·麦考莱·屈威廉（George Macaulay Trevelyan，1876-1962），于1876年2月16日出生在英格兰沃里克郡的一个上流社会家庭。他的父亲乔治·奥托·屈威廉（Sir George Otto Trevelyan，1838-1928）是一名自由党政治家与历史作家，在格拉斯顿政府中担任过爱尔兰首席大臣与苏格兰大臣。他的祖父查尔斯·屈威廉（Sir Charles Trevelyan，1807-1886）也是一名自由党政治家，生平最重要的两项工作是负责应对爱尔兰大饥荒与推动英国文官制度改革。屈威廉的舅公则是赫赫有名的辉格党政治家、辉格史学鼻祖托马斯·巴宾顿·麦考莱（Thomas Babington Macaulay，1800-1859）。此外，他的两位兄长，一位是自由党政治家（后加入工党），一位是诗人、翻译家。出生在这样一个政治-学术家族，G.M.屈威廉的一生免不了受到影响，最终也取得了不亚于家族其他人的成就。

乔治·麦考莱·屈威廉

按照父亲的安排，屈威廉先后进入哈罗公学与剑桥大学学习，就读期间对历史、文学表现出浓厚的兴趣与过人的天赋。在大学毕业前就出版了《威克利夫时代的英格兰》（1899），这为他赢得了在剑桥任教的资格。不过，屈威廉在剑桥的时间非常短暂，1903年，他决定离开剑桥，因为想要“更多的时间从事历史写作”，他也“负担得起没有固定薪资”的生活，但或许更主要的原因是，他所推…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[解决 VLC 的视频播放问题？以下是检查 VLC 日志文件的方法。


在 VLC 上观看你喜爱的视频时，你可能会遇到与编解码器、时间戳、视频播放等相关的问题。

但好消息是，就像 检查防火墙的日志 一样，你可以使用 VLC 执行相同的操作来跟踪错误的根本原因。


📋 与 Linux 不同，VLC 不会自动保存日志，一旦关闭，所有日志都会自动删除，因此你必须手动保存它们。


因此，请确保在关闭 VLC 播放器之前保存或读取日志文件。

检查并保存 VLC 日志文件

虽然听起来很复杂，但这是最简单的方法，它不仅允许你保存日志，还可以让你读取日志而不将其保存到文件中。

首先，从顶部菜单栏转到“工具Tools”菜单，然后选择“消息Messages”，或者，你也可以按 Ctrl + M 达到相同的效果：



它将显示与当前播放的视频文件相关的日志。

在这里，你有两种选择：你可以仅读取日志，也可以保存日志。

单击“消息”选项卡后，你会注意到 “冗余Verbosity” 选项，因此让我们看一下多个详细程度选项的效果。


错误Errors: 只会记录错误信息

警告Warnings: 它将总结错误和警告消息

调试Debug：此级别将包括错误、警告和调试消息


选择适当的详细程度选项后，你很快就会看到与所选选项相关的日志。



正如你所看到的，当我选择 “调试” 选项时，它还包含警告日志。

要保存日志，请点击 “另存为Save as...” 按钮，它将打开文件管理器，在这选择保存文件的位置并为其指定适当的名称：



现在，你可以使用任何文本编辑器打开日志文件：



从这里，你可以识别导致错误的罪魁祸首。

有关 VLC 的更多信息

你是否知道你可以使用 VLC 下载 YouTube 视频或使用 YouTube 链接来流式传输视频而无需广告？

嗯，VLC 能做的远不止这些。如果你有兴趣，请查看我们详细的 让 VLC 更出色的技巧指南。

我希望本指南对你有所帮助。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[想要规划、主办及管理一次成功的黑客马拉松，请遵循以下蓝图。


初看起来，黑客马拉松hackathon是很简单的事情。你需要为它投入多少准备呢？仅设置一个日期，人们便会自动参与。然而，实际上并非如此！

虽然你可以依靠这种方式碰碰运气，但实际情况是，黑客马拉松是科技行业中的基石体验，参与者都有自己的期待。不仅如此，你的组织也有特定的需求，并应该为黑客马拉松设定目标。那么，你应该如何保障黑客马拉松对你的组织和参与者都有益呢？

成功的黑客马拉松，取决于一系列可能会反复出现的决定。关于你想达成什么目标的决定，将影响你使用哪些资源以及采用何种沟通方式。这些决定将影响你是选择线上还是线下进行，而这个决定又将反过来影响你需要的资源以及如何沟通。对齐黑客马拉松的计划并非只是让人们达成共识那么简单。你需要一整套内在的决策来达成一致。例如，一场技术难度较高的黑客马拉松可能无法吸引大量观众（你可以问我怎么知道！），并需要一种需要特殊资源的招募策略。

这些年来，我主办过很多次黑客马拉松，包括最近几个月中，在我所在的组织主办的一次黑客马拉松，由此催生了我们将融入到我们的开源产品 Traefik Proxy 3.0 下一版本中的新特性。因此，相信我，策划一个能丰富参与者体验，同时为你的项目创造有价值成果的黑客马拉松，不仅仅需要期待、披萨，和混乱！

本文以最近的 Traefik Labs 黑客马拉松为蓝图。我分享了一个清单，提供了一些技巧和窍门，帮你确定目标，规划比赛，管理报酬，分享你的成果，以及处理黑客马拉松的长期效应（黑客马拉松结束后的工作并未结束！）

这个指南充当了你规划最佳实践的模板，让你也能成功举办一场有大量目标受众并能带来实效的黑客马拉松！

1、确定目标的三个问题

首要且至关重要的步骤就是设定你的目标。这可不简单，设立目标前你需要在多个方面进行内部整合，提出如…]]></summary>

 A basic overall of the features are:
 Update command that automatically downloads and installs the latest version of the app,
 Supports exporting and importing other sessions generated by the app
 And it has a neat little encoding feature.
 Other features can be found on the readme and their usage is also provided.
 Sadly it only works on linux due to the `tty` library being used, but I'll fix that eventually.

 I'd appreciate it if you gave it a spin and told me what you think / any issues I should adress. All you need is a C/make build environment and Perl (the benchmarks are in Perl and C/XS) e.g.:
  # Debian/Ubuntu etc sudo apt-get update sudo apt-get -y install build-essential perl cpanminus # CentOS/Redhat etc sudo yum update sudo yum -y install gcc make patch perl perl-App-cpanminus 
 The last package is Perl's CPAN package manager, so installing and running the benchmark suite simply becomes:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[近期，对冲基金Satori Fund创始人公开唱空苹果公司，并称要在美东时间9月12日苹果公司的iPhone 15秋季新品发布会前后做空苹果公司股票。而在苹果年度最重磅新品发布会之前，本周苹果累计下跌5.95%，市值蒸发1764亿美元(约合人民币1.30万亿元)。


苹果公司将于下周举行发布会，推出iPhone 15系列手机。摩根大通周五发布报告称，即将发布的苹果iPhone 15并没有实质性的升级，因此也不会吸引大量用户更新换代。摩根大通将苹果目标股价从235美元调低至230美元。


至于价格问题，摩根大通称：“iPhone会涨价吗？我们认为，苹果很可能对所有型号的iPhone都涨价，而不仅限于Pro型号。如果基础款和Pro款的价格差距过大，那么消费者就没有太大的动力来购买高端型号。”


大佬计划做空苹果公司


据上海证券报9月10日消息，近期，对冲基金Satori Fund创始人兼投资组合经理丹·尼尔斯(Dan Niles)在社交媒体发文称要做空苹果公司。


尼尔斯表示，计划在iPhone 15新品发布前后，即美东时间9月12日做空苹果公司，并表示苹果公司现在是他们最大的单一股票空头头寸。


做空苹果公司的原因是什么？尼尔斯称，鉴于中国科技公司华为在其新款Mate60 Pro智能手机技术上取得突破，苹果公司面临的竞争将加剧。


尼尔斯并非第一次看空苹果公司。8月20日，尼尔斯曾在其网站发布对于苹果公司的详细看法。


在文中，尼尔斯表示，短期来看，自8月18日以来，苹果公司的股票在相对强势的基础上处于超卖状态。因为苹果公司即将推出iPhone 15新品，从历史先例来看投资苹果公司是一个不错的短期交易。但是现在苹果公司估值较高，所以，并不建议长期投资者购买苹果公司的股票。


自8月18日以来，苹果公司股票短期上涨超9%。但是近一周以来，苹果公司表现不佳，累计下跌5.95%，市值蒸发约1764亿美元。


尼尔斯的这项操作也和其管理基金的投资策略有关。尼尔斯介绍道：“我们的基金是‘全天候基金’，无论市场状况如何，期望都能产生正收益。随着时间的推移，我们的净敞口预计将保持在25%左右(多头资产的百分比减去空头资产的百分比)，即使在严重的市场调整期间，回撤也极小。”


未来走势，投行现分歧


对于苹果未来走势，华尔街投行现分歧。其中，摩根大通周五发布报告称，即将于下周发布的iPhone15并没有实质性的升级，因此也不会吸引大量用户更新换代。为此，摩根大通将苹果目标股价从235美元调低至230美元。


据证券时报报道，美国投行Needham在周四发布的报告中写道，苹果公司是当前全球市值最大的公司，但人工智能的发展趋势最终可能会颠覆这一排名。这可能会导致苹果被微软、谷歌和亚马逊这三家科技巨无霸超越。


不过，美国投行Wedbush分析师DanIves似乎不这么认为。他在最新报告中指出，即将发布的iPhone15将推动苹果股价在目前水平上上涨20%。DanIves保持对这家科技巨头的增持评级，并维持了230美元的目标股价。


据了解，苹果日前官宣，北京时间9月13日凌晨1点，将召开特别活动，主题为“好奇心上头”。按照外界预期，此次发布将推出新一代的iPhone15系列，以及新一代AppleWatchS9和第二代AppleWatchUltra等。


据悉，Apple Watch Series 9和第二代Apple WatchUltra将升级各类传感器和组件。另外，新款Apple Watch将搭载全新的U2超宽带芯片。新芯片将提高iPhone的定位功能，允许在“查找我的应用程序”中更准确地跟踪人员和设备。


另外，据MacRumors最新报道显示，不锈钢材质的Apple Watch Series 9将使用3D打印技术来打印外壳。苹果计划明年开始将3D打印技术运用在Apple WatchUltra的生产中。

微评：我觉得，这么多年以来，做空苹果的人基本上坟头都长草了，但我还是欢迎做空苹果，这样可以给我抄底苹果的机会。我认为，以苹果目前的价格，170美元是抄底的机会。]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[按惯例，LCTT 每两年会做一次总结，在第一年、第三年、第五年、第七年、第九年都分别做了陈文。今年本来不必再赘述，但是，一方面今年是第十年了，这是个有意义的年份；另外一方面，今年以来，生成式 AI 的横空出世也深切影响到了翻译这件事。因此，我觉得有必要写点什么。

十年前的这一天上午，在没有经过预先安排和详细计划的情况下，我在 QQ 群内发起了 LCTT。原本的初心是翻译 Linux 上的手册页，因为现存的中文手册页实在残破不堪。由于没有协作翻译的经验，当时先建立了一个实验性项目 TranslateProject，收集了一些英文文章来翻译。果然，在这个过程中，我们发现并改正了不少流程上的不足。这些经验甚至成为了其它类似翻译活动的基础。

但是，遗憾的是，作为我们最初的目标，中文手册页项目，却由于种种原因，中道烂尾。至今叹息。

好了，作为十年总结，我应该将过去十年的成绩做个总结。

这十年间，我们总计有 547 位贡献者参与了从选题、翻译、校对到发布等多种贡献；这些贡献者翻译超过 10 篇的译者中有 117 位，超过 100 篇的有 8 位，而最大贡献者 geekpi 一个人就翻译了 2015.5 篇；所有的贡献者们总共翻译了 7929 篇文章。这些文章，仅在我们官方的官网、微信公众号、知乎等内容渠道就获得了上亿次阅读。

通过翻译这些文章，很多人第一次接触了开源，并亲自参与了贡献，学会了使用 GitHub 和 Git，有的人还在日后的学习和工作中，成为了开源贡献者、布道者。

现在回头看，这十年，LCTT 至少还是做了一些有意义的事情的。

表完了成绩之后，我谈谈对将来的看法。

可能有的同学已经在我们近期的文章中发现，有部分文章是由 AI（ChatGPT）翻译的。这件事其实给我带来了很大的触动。

之前，我们在翻译过程中，并不排斥译者们使用计算机辅助翻译（CAT）来帮助翻译，比如谷歌翻译、DeepL 等，只要译者能够尽职审阅校对就好，甚至有时候，这些平台会给出一些比手译更合适的参照译法。在这个过程中，这些平台基本上处于参照的地位，并不能有效的形成“信达雅”的译文。

在 OpenAI 的 ChatGPT 横空出世之后，一个最常见的用例就是用来翻译外文内容。我们也做了一些尝试，令我吃惊的是，在经过调校之后，ChatGPT（3.5）可以形成通顺、合理、可信的译文。并且，在经过它的再次润色后，可以更进一步提高译文的可读性。甚至，在个别情况下，它还能找出原文中存在的错误，比如误用的命令。

当然，出于负责的角度，我们会对这些文章进行专门的校对，以免出现被 AI 愚弄的情况。

那么，LCTT 还有存在的必要吗？我认为是有的，一方面，在短期看来，AI 翻译还没有足够成熟，至少在 AI 幻觉没解决之前，并不能完全依赖 AI，尤其是在专业技术领域。另外一方面，AI 确实可以极大地加速翻译过程，提升翻译质量，我们完全可以在相同的贡献者基础上，贡献更多的专业内容。

所以，之后的 LCTT 可能要从“翻译为主，校对为辅”转变为“AI 翻译为辅，专业校对为主”的贡献模式了。顺便说一句，在 Bestony 的努力下，我们已经在开发一个新的 AI 辅助翻译平台，到时候会极大地提升翻译的质量和数量。

那么，让我们期待 LCTT 的下一个十年，一个蜕变的十年吧！

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[生成式 AI 对工作岗位的威胁不如其它自动化技术

据一份报告，到 2030 年，人工智能将取代 240 万个美国工作岗位，并影响另外 1100 万个工作岗位，但其他形式的自动化将导致更多工作岗位流失。研究认为，AI 技术将重塑更多的工作岗位，而不是取代更多的工作岗位。最有可能被抛弃的白领将是技术撰稿人、社会科学研究助理、校对员、文案和行政岗位人员。拥有大学学历、从事白领工作且属于中产阶级的工人将感受到最大的冲击。


消息来源：The Register



老王点评：尽管这些自动化形式可能会造成短期内的工作岗位减少，但长期来看，它们也可能通过提高效率、创造新型业务或催生新的就业领域，从而有可能创建新的工作岗位。




苹果争分夺秒修补最新的 iPhone 零日漏洞

苹果设备再次受到攻击，在野外发现了一个零点击的零日漏洞，该漏洞用于向 iPhone 发送 Pegasus 间谍软件。即使运行最新版本的 iOS（16.6）也无法抵御该漏洞的攻击。该漏洞涉及包含恶意图片的 PassKit 附件。PassKit 是为添加到用户苹果钱包的可分发通行证提供的服务。一旦发送到受害者的 iMessage 帐户，NSO 集团的 Pegasus 间谍软件就可以在没有交互的情况下部署。


消息来源：The Register



老王点评：即便如苹果手机，依然有非常严重的安全问题。但是我相信，安卓手机可能安全问题更多。




纳斯达克获准基于 AI 的交易指令

美国证券交易委员会（SEC）已经批准了纳斯达克运营首个交易所 AI 驱动订单类型的请求。新系统被称为动态中点延时订单，它将使用 AI 进行实时更新和重新校准。这种自动化形式已经存在了一段时间，但新的 AI 驱动订单类型是首个使用实时强化学习 AI 来执行订单的同类产品。这将大大加快系统下单的速度。纳斯达克称，成交率提高了 20.3%，标出率降低了 11.4%。


消息来源：Coin Telegraph



老王点评：虽然不是 AI 炒股，但是 AI 可以加速交易。不过我还是好奇，要是有一天，操盘的是 AI，交易的是 AI，到时候会是什么景象。]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[马小鹤 （章静 绘）

诞生在美索不达米亚平原的摩尼教，中古时期曾广泛流行于丝绸之路，遭到镇压后避入中国东南沿海的福建、浙江等地，一度湮没无闻。十九世纪末二十世纪初的考古发现使摩尼教原始文献重见天日，成为能够“预流”的热门学问，又有金庸小说将其引入华语文学世界，自此人们对摩尼教的兴趣与误解同在。
作为一个世界性宗教，摩尼教文献由中古波斯、帕提亚、粟特、回鹘、科普特等多种语言构成，摩尼教研究因此被认为是极有难度的学术制高点之一，也是一门真正国际化的学问。在敦煌吐鲁番文书惊现于世的年代，罗振玉、王国维、陈垣等人对其中的摩尼教经典做了刊布与研究，中国的学术得以立于国际摩尼教学林。一个世纪后，中国福建的霞浦、屏南、福清等地自2008年起陆续发现摩尼教科仪文书、摩尼教造像和文物，再度引起国际学术界的广泛关注。
哈佛大学燕京图书馆中国研究馆员马小鹤多年来致力于摩尼教研究，著有《摩尼教与古代西域史研究》（中国人民大学出版社，2008）、《光明的使者：摩尼与摩尼教》（兰州大学出版社，2013）、《霞浦文书研究》（兰州大学出版社，2014）等。他对福建新出的文献做出解读，在国际摩尼教学术讨论会上介绍其内涵，是为国际学界关注霞浦文书之始。
新材料相继涌现，研究不断进展，学者也不吝于更新自己的观点。在《上海书评》的专访中，马小鹤先生重新探讨了他对福建霞浦文书的认识，澄清人们对摩尼教的常见误区，并介绍了摩尼教研究的最新进展。

摩尼教在很长一段时间内被认为是一个“死去”的世界性宗教，而近年在福建霞浦等地陆续发现的一批民间宗教文书，被认为包含有明确的摩尼教因素，可能改写摩尼教的历史。能否请您简要勾勒摩尼教兴衰的时间线，并结合这批文书谈谈摩尼教在华的…]]></summary>

最新发布的 Armbian 有助于解决在 Arm 计算机上安装并运行 Linux 发行版的困难 —— 这是一项不小的挑战。

今年 3 月我们 评测 的联想 Thinkpad X13S 第一代，是我们评估的首款主流 Arm 驱动笔记本电脑。当然，市面上确实还有其他的 Arm 笔记本，如 Pine64 的 Pinebook Pro 和多款基于 Arm 的 ChromeBook 等。然而，X13S 更接近常规的基于 x86 的笔记本电脑：具备优质的配置，配有 16GB 内存和 256GB 的 NVMe SSD，更重要的是，它搭载了 PC 行业标准的 UEFI 固件，这在消费级 Arm 计算机上尚属罕见。另一个好消息是，你可以禁用安全启动，这是许多 Arm 设备不支持的。十年前，这是最初的微软 Surface RT 的一个 关键问题：Windows RT 一团糟，而它的固件不让你运行其他的系统。

虽然 X13S 从 2022 年 5 月就开始发售，但要让这个机器支持运行 Linux，却花费了一段不短的时间。一篇 博客文章 列出一些相关问题，文章副标题 “拥抱苦难” 已经透露出难度之大。这篇文章链接了一篇有关如何在该机器上安装 Debian 的 很老的指南。我们按照指南操作，尝试安装中间版的 Debian，定制内核，看起来安装成功了。

将其从 SSD 启动，着实需要巨大的努力，这涉及到进入 UEFI 固件 Shell，并手动逐个查阅 30 到 40 个条目才能找出并启用正确的 UEFI 启动条目，但经过数小时的寻找和无数次的重启，它成功工作了，Debian 能够启动。不幸的是，在启动已经安装的操作系统时，屏幕在输出几行以后就变黑了，再也没亮过。虽然操作系统还在运行…]]></summary>

I use a variety of Linux distros both in my homelab and in my work environment (Ubuntu, Rocky, Alma, OpenSUSE, etc), I even use Linux as my daily work driver, often preferring to use it to manage servers, watching YouTube, playing music, etc. I used to daily drive Linux on and off (on my personal system) every 6 months or so just to see the state of Linux, Linux gaming, Nvidia (although this doesn't stop me since they're good enough; could be better *cough* *cough* nvidia *cough*).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have a 4k Dell laptop provided through my work. I started using Ubuntu then PopOS last year because some software I needed was Unix only. I am planning a switch to Debian and a much more minimal system as I have fallen in love with the minimalism and customizability of Linux. I am trying to decide what WM I will use and the big branch point is X or Wayland. I understand Wayland has come a long way, but I keep finding posts about poor HiDPI support on xwayland. I wanted to get opinions about this. 
 Some notes about my use case: I run my 4k display at 2x scaling and reduce the font size to 0.8 currently. I almost never connect it to an external display. I use Zoom daily for meetings and have to share my screen often. My most commonly used programs appear to all have Wayland native versions, but I do have some regularly used software which I am not sure about, in particular DICOM viewers (I use slicer which is a QT app, but am open to changing if there's a better option). 
 Thanks in advance for your help!

        <id>https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37448005</id>
        <link href="https://github.com/Ads-cmu/WhatsApp-Llama"/>
        <updated>2023-09-09T17:43:11.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello HN!
I've been thinking about the idea of a LLM thats a clone of me - instead of generating replies to be a helpful assistant, it generates replies that are exactly like mine. The concept's appeared in fiction numerous times (the talking paintings in Harry Potter that mimic the person painted, the clones in The Prestige), and I think with LLMs, there might actually be a possibility of us doing something like this!
I've just released a fork of the facebookresearch/llama-recipes which allows you to fine-tune a Llama model on your personal WhatsApp conversations. This adaptation can train the model (using QLoRA) to respond in a way that's eerily similar to your own texting style.
What I've figured out so far:
Quick Learning: The model quickly adapts to personal nuances, emoji usage, and phrases that you use. I've trained just 1 epoch on a P100 GPU using QLoRA and 4 bit quantization, and its already captured my mannerisms
Turing Tests: As an experiment, I asked my friends to ask me 3 questions, and responded with 2 candidate responses (one from me and one from llama). My friends then had to guess which candidate response was mine and which one was Llama's. Llama managed to fool 10% of my friends, but with more compute, I think it can do way better.
Here's the GitHub repository: https://github.com/Ads-cmu/WhatsApp-Llama/
Would love to hear feedback, suggestions, and any cool experiences if you decide to give it a try! I'd love to see how far we can push this by training bigger models for more epochs (I ran out of compute credits)

        <id>https://www.williamlong.info/archives/7283.html</id>
        <link href="https://www.williamlong.info/archives/7283.html"/>
        <updated>2023-09-09T14:25:57.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[近日，一份行政处罚决定书引发关注。2023年8月20日，江苏镇江市公安局丹徒分局民警接报警，发现一家牛肉汤馆提供的无线网络WiFi为开放式，输入密码即可登录，未记录用户号码。这家店铺被予以行政警告处罚。


记者在江苏公安执法公示平台搜索发现，这并非个例。仅2023年8月，镇江市公安局丹徒分局就开出了14份针对公共场所提供开放式WiFi的行政处罚决定书。根据处罚决定书，这样的做法被认为是没有履行网络安全保护义务。


事实上，据镇江市公安局网络安全保卫支队官方账号发布的信息，早在2018年2月，镇江警方就开始对公共场所WiFi分阶段调查、登记、备案，推动WiFi审计设备的普遍安装和使用。3个月后，2018年5月，镇江开出了第一张“WiFi罚单”。


对WiFi用户资料做记录的规定，已有至少17年历史。早在2006年，公安部出台的《互联网安全保护技术措施规定》中就明确，互联网服务提供者和互联网使用单位应当落实记录并留存用户登录和退出时间等。此外，还应当安装并运行互联网公共上网服务场所安全管理系统，并提供符合公共安全行业技术标准的联网接口。


网络安全法是中国第一部规范网络空间问题的法律，自2017年6月1日起施行。第21条规定，网络运营者应当按照规定履行安全保护义务，保障网络免受干扰、破坏或者未经授权的访问，防止网络数据泄露或者被窃取、篡改。其中就包括，采取监测、记录网络运行状态、网络安全事件的技术措施，并按照规定留存相关的网络日志不少于6个月。


若网络运营者不履行上述义务，网络安全法第59条规定，由有关主管部门责令改正，给予警告；拒不改正或导致危害网络安全等后果的，处1万元以上10万元以下罚款，对直接负责的主管人员处5000元以上5万元以下罚款。


对因不履行网络安全管理义务而带来危害的，严重者可入刑。


刑法286条规定：网络服务提供者经监管部门责令采取改正措施而拒不改正，致使违法信息大量传播、用户信息泄露或刑事案件证据灭失，造成严重后果的，处3年以下有期徒刑、拘役或者管制，并处或者单处罚金。


一些城市对于公共场所无线上网作出了更细致的规定。例如，2018年6月，江苏省扬州市公安局出台《关于加强公共无线上网场所网络安全治理的通告》，要求开通上网服务的公共场所在网络正式联通之日起30日内，向属地县级公安机关网络安全保卫部门备案。


此外，扬州发布的规定还要求，公共上网场所应采取手机短信验证、真实身份信息核验等实名认证方式；规范上网服务标识，在场所醒目位置统一悬挂“扬州市公共安全无线覆盖区域”的网络服务标识，禁止以“公共账号或固定密码”等非实名方式提供服务；禁止向身份不明或拒绝身份查验的用户提供上网服务等。

附录：《网络安全法》相关条款


第二十一条：



第二十一条　国家实行网络安全等级保护制度。网络运营者应当按照网络安全等级保护制度的要求，履行下列安全保护义务，保障网络免受干扰、破坏或者未经授权的访问，防止网络数据泄露或者被窃取、篡改：


（一）制定内部安全管理制度和操作规程，确定网络安全负责人，落实网络安全保护责任；


（二）采取防范计算机病毒和网络攻击、网络侵入等危害网络安全行为的技术措施；


（三）采取监测、记录网络运行状态、网络安全事件的技术措施，并按照规定留存相关的网络日志不少于六个月；


（四）采取数据分类、重要数据备份和加密等措施；


（五）法律、行政法规规定的其他义务。



第五十九条：



第五十九条　网络运营者不履行本法第二十一条、第二十五条规定的网络安全保护义务的，由有关主管部门责令改正，给予警告；拒不改正或者导致危害网络安全等后果的，处一万元以上十万元以下罚款，对直接负责的主管人员处五千元以上五万元以下罚款。


关键信息基础设施的运营者不履行本法第三十三条、第三十四条、第三十六条、第三十八条规定的网络安全保护义务的，由有关主管部门责令改正，给予警告；拒不改正或者导致危害网络安全等后果的，处十万元以上一百万元以下罚款，对直接负责的主管人员处一万元以上十万元以下罚款。



微评：我觉得，小吃店根本没有保护用户信息安全的能力，要是大家把手机号提供给小吃店，被小吃店有意或无意中泄露出去，那危害不是更大？]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I used to find plenty of jobs for infrastructure engineers based on Linux and OSS. But since the invent of proper cloud AWS, etc these jobs are harder to find. Nowadays all you get is devops engineers jobs which need you to be a developer, infrastructure engineer, cloud certified etc all in one. Cloud providers even have their own certifications now which makes RHCE, Linux comptia etc obsolete. And AWS for example have their own version of Linux which if I am not mistaken has it's own certification. 
 Has cloud killed of traditional infrastructure engineer jobs? Is there still companies out there that does not care about cloud and vendor lock in? Is Linux on a mass scale being replaced by cloud systems? What is your take?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So for whatever reasons I decided to get away from the NVidia chain gang disaster of driver mess on Linux. That is not hyperbole at all until one tries to look at CUDA with the NVidia drivers and then other software bits. Just a mess of compatibility issues and endlessly dropped GPU devices from the driver support. So I gave up entirely and looked at the AMD Radeon goodness. Well it seems that the AMD Radeon line has something they call "PRO". That has to be good right? The thing middle of the road is a single slot unit that only draws 130 Watts. Nifty. Even better it claims "Hardware Raytracing" and 8G of GDDR6 memory. Whatever that is. Seems like a good card.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[无人注意，新安装的 Ubuntu 23.04 不支持安装 32 位应用

有用户报告，在新安装的 Ubuntu 23.04 上从 Ubuntu 仓库安装的 Steam 客户端是不工作的。在 Ubuntu 23.04 中使用了基于 Flutter 的新安装程序，它在后台使用了 Subiquity，默认情况下并不支持 32 位库。结果就是，尽管 Ubuntu 23.04 用户可以运行 apt 命令或点击软件中心的安装按钮来安装，但由于 Steam 所依赖的 32 位库无法被调入，因此，对大多数用户来说 Steam 无法正常运行。问题是，4 月份发布的 Ubuntu 23.04 现在才被发现这个问题。原因可能是，一方面大部分用户是从之前版本升级而来，带有 32 位库支持，也有很多人是直接从 Valve 下载了带有 32 位支持的 Linux 版 Steam；另外一方面，短期版的 Ubuntu 用户可能真不多。


消息来源：Omg Ubuntu



老王点评：Ubuntu 开发人员不可能也不应该发现所有问题，但是 Linux 桌面的用户群体，可能真的很少。




研究称 Linux 市场规模每年增长约 20%

根据一家研究机构的报告，2022 年，全球 Linux 操作系统市场规模为 62 亿美元，预计在预测期内将以 18.94% 的年复合增长率增长，到 2028 年将达到 170 亿美元。


消息来源：Benzinga



老王点评：结合上一条，Linux 整体的市场发展是很好，但 Linux 桌面可能会是一直的短板。




安卓 14 仍不能正确计算存储空间利用率

我们通常依靠安卓的存储利用率工具来查找占用存储空间的应用程序和文件，以便在需要时卸载或删除它们。然而有专家发现，谷歌对安卓系统组件占用空间的计算存在缺陷。安卓将系统存储空间计算为除了音频、视频、图片、文档、垃圾和游戏等之外的其他类别所占的空间。也就是说，安卓“系统”不仅仅包括安卓系统文件。


消息来源：Android Police



老王点评：只能说安卓开发人员偷懒了，他们认为就不应该有“偷偷”以其它未分类类别出现的文件。


回音


在 Linus Torvalds 提出 批评 后，Bcachefs 首席开发者继续 表达 了他对 Linux 内核上游进程和开发者互动的不满，表示要休息一段时间。显然，Bcachefs 不会在 Linux 6.6 合并窗口关闭的最后一分钟提交新的拉取请求了。]]></summary>

博尔赫斯在晚年写过这样一个故事：“一年秋天，时间长河里的一个秋天”，神道教的神道们召开集会，他们对人类发明的种种“可能永远结束历史”的危险之物忧心忡忡，于是商议“不如我们把人们消灭掉吧”。就在这危急关头，一位神道却不慌不忙地指出，虽然人们发明了那些残酷的东西，但“也发明了一种可以将世间的空间填进十七个音的东西……于是一首俳句给人类带来了拯救”（《作品带来的拯救》，收录于《地图册》，王永年译，上海译文出版社，2016年，83-85页）。
我们并不知道俳句是否曾在某个时刻拯救过人类，但至少博尔赫斯对它有所偏爱。理查德·弗兰纳根同样如此。《深入北方的小路》的原名The Narrow Road to the Deep North是俳句大师松尾芭蕉的名作《奥之细道》篇名的英文直译。全书共五章，皆由俳句引出——想来弗兰纳根也一定同意博尔赫斯的说法，至少这部小说的空间，总可以填进这隽永的十七个音。
然而这并不是某种文人的游戏。隽永总与残酷相连——如若没有残酷之举，人类断不需要创造隽永以求救赎。而残酷究竟由何而来？当弗兰纳根以日本俳句作为《深入北方的小路》的外衣，其内核却是二战时期日军的暴行之一——为占领当时的英属缅甸，日军驱使总计超过六万两千名战俘修建缅甸铁路（又名泰缅铁路）。由于恶劣的施工环境和种种虐待暴行，到铁路通车（原计划六年，实际用时十七个月），约四分之一战俘丧命，于是这条铁路亦被冠以“死亡铁路”之名。著名电影《桂河大桥》（The Bridge on the River Kwai，1957）便是基于这一背景的创作。然而实际上，除了这一背景，整部电影纯属虚构。影片中英国战俘带着某种奇怪的荣誉感为日军修筑铁路桥，只为证明“完成这座桥的不是一群奴隶，而是一群战士…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Librum，这是一个全新的，配备云图书馆功能的电子书阅读器。


你是不是酷爱阅读？或者正在逐渐沦为书虫？

放心，我们为你准备了绝佳的解决方案！

Librum 阅读器，这是一个全新的电子阅读器产品，它打造的阅读环境 “能让每个人都发现阅读的乐趣，轻松愉快地阅读”。

尽管它并非你通常会使用的那种离线阅读器应用，但在 Linux 最佳电子阅读器 的榜单上，很可能是候选之一。因为有了 Librum，你可以 充分发挥云技术的优势，任何时候，无论使用哪个设备，都能随时访问个人图书馆。

下面，就让我来为你详细介绍一下。

Librum：概览 ⭐



Librum 基本上是通过 QML 和 C++ 构建的，这款 开源的电子书阅读器 允许你以直观的界面将内容同步到云端。

你可以免费开始使用，初次注册便有 2GB 的云存储空间。此外，一些尚未最终确定的高级套餐也即将推出。


🚧 Librum 阅读器目前正在积极开发中，尚未发布稳定版。


Librum 还配有丰富的功能，其中一些突出之处包括：


图书馆的个性化定制

书籍的元数据编辑

云同步

现代化的界面


推荐阅读 📖


8 个 Linux 上的最佳电子书阅读器


初步体验 👨‍💻

我首次尝试在我的 Ubuntu 22.04 系统上运行 Librum。但是，在我使用该应用之前，我 必须先创建一个账户，提供电子邮件地址和密码。

虽然 Librum 的主打功能是基于云的体验，但我 还是希望它能有一个专门的离线模式，可以让我在注册之前做一些试用，或者作为一种可选择的备用模式。

不过，我还是继续前进，并登录了这款应用。我使用 “添加书籍Add books” 功能导入了一些书籍，然后它们就在主页标签下被整齐地排列好，提供了对其排序、过滤或添加标签的选项。



电子书的阅读体验 几乎与你对现代阅读器应用的期待一致，拥有最简界面，还有放大文本、进入全屏模式等功能。



汉堡菜单的选项内含有一些基本功能。最上面三个选项可以让你打印、保存或分享当前打开的电子书。

此外的选项还包括：文本转语音功能、连续/垂直显示页面、反转颜色、同步书籍，以及访问设置菜单。



我也试用了一下 搜索功能：我可以快速地查找特定的词汇，并可以高亮显示所有结果、区分大小写或搜索整个单词。



目录功能 也相当方便使用，你可以使用搜索栏查找特定章节。



以上就是我使用 Librum 阅读器的电子书阅读体验。

但是等一下，这还没完，还有更多的东西等着你去发现！

未来计划的功能 📝



我注意到还有很多功能正在开发中。

其中一个是 一个在应用内部的免费书店，计划将提供超过 70,000 本的电子书籍；另一个是 统计页面，将会显示 个人的阅读统计信息。

最后一个是 插件页面，应该是提供 进一步增强 Librum 功能的插件。



预计在接下来的几个月内会发布稳定版本。

开发者们还没有明确说明即将推出的付费计划具体会提供什么。我个人猜测可能会提供更多的云存储空间和接入更多新奇的功能。

我推荐你关注他们的 新闻页面，以便获取有关 Librum 阅读器的最新信息。

📥 获取 Librum

目前，Librum 以 Flatpak 形式提供给 Linux 用户，并且还在为 Windows 和 macOS 用户开发对应版本。

转到 官方网站 或 Flathub 商店 就可以获取下载。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Linux Lite 6.6 可能没有大的变化，但看起来它专注于有用的部分。


Linux Lite 是 最好的轻量级 Linux 发行版 之一，提供 类似 Windows 的体验。

我们上次了解它是在今年早些时候，当时 Linux Lite 6.4 添加了一些重大更改。现在，他们又发布了一个小版本，承诺进行大量改进。

🆕 Linux Lite 6.6：有什么新变化？



该版本被称为 2012 年以来最大的 Linux Lite 版本之一，增加了数千行新代码。Linux Lite 6.6 由可靠的 Linux 内核 5.15 提供支持，是一个适度的更新。

一些亮点包括：


改进了 Lite 欢迎应用

免费 AI 聊天机器人

支持新语言


改进的 Lite Welcome



“Lite Welcome” 应用已更新，当未安装 Linux Lite 时，在立付会话中显示 “立即安装Install Now” 按钮。现在它将检查它是否在立付环境中运行并相应地显示按钮。

这将是直接将 Linux Lite 安装到系统上的便捷方法。此次更新还为欢迎应用添加了另一个选项。下面有更多内容。

Free A.I. Chatbot



欢迎应用程序中的一个新链接可直接前往 Linux Lite 的网络聊天机器人，名为 “Free A.I. Chatbot”。

用户可以使用它来获得与 Linux Lite 相关的支持。尽管我希望这是系统中内置的专用应用，但拥有它仍然很有趣。

你还可以使用网络浏览器直接 访问 它。

支持新语言



这是上述代码行的主要部分，Linux Lite 6.6 中添加了对 22 种语言的支持。

我用“印地语”测试了它，效果很好。尽管某些选项仍然以英语显示，但很高兴看到它们试图更具包容性，提供更广泛的语言选项。

提供这些语言的区域包括主菜单、右键单击菜单、文件夹名称、Linux Lite 应用名称、桌面图标和“我的电脑”菜单名称。

🛠️ 其他更改和改进

其余的变化包括新壁纸和应用更新。其中一些是：


Chrome 116

VLC 3.0.16

Gimp 2.10.30

LibreOffice 7.5.6

Thunderbird 102.15

新壁纸

包含最新的 Papirus 图标主题。

硬件数据库目前拥有超过 85,000 条提交内容。


有关这些变化的更详细的展望，请访问其 公告。

📥 下载 Linux Lite 6.6

你可以前往 官方网站 获取此版本或单击下面的按钮。

 Now this may sound like a dumb thing to post considering I'm in the Linux Reddit , but I've posted this on the Zorin forum and if I post this on Microsoft I'd be lucky not to get a ban. And I'm pretty sure even the biggest Linux mains have used Windows at least once before so that's something to lean on.

 Now personally I prefer Windows, I grew up with Windows Vista/7 and it has never failed me to the point I'd pack my things and get a Mac, but I have used Linux/Zorin before. Zorin was my first Linux OS that was pre-installed on a Lenovo PC I got late 2021 and to be fair it was solid. It had a nice lightweight sense to it and wasn't bloated with sponsors, but the OS felt a bit Anorexic. In …]]></summary>

From that point, I used every version of Windows from 3.1 up to 7 (including 2000 and NT, as my parents worked in IT) with great enthusiasm. Needless to say, with the viruses, bugs, BSOD and such, I always had a love/hate relationship with Windows. But overall I used to really love it and will keep fond memories from those times. Everything changed with Windows 8. And 8.1. And 10. And now 11. I have sadly witnessed the downfall of Windows, and since almost a decade now I have hated every minute spent on that OS. Windows is dead to me. It has joined the Sith and has fallen into the dark side: it is now mostly a spyware that constantly nags you, removes control you have over your machine and does ever…]]></summary>

In the first article, he outlines the "big changes for SymPy with particular focus on speed".  The second covers polynomial handling; subsequent articles will examine other pieces of the puzzle.

I will be writing this in a series of blog posts. This first post will outline the structure of the foundations of a computer algebra system (CAS) like SymPy, describe some problems SymPy currently has and what can be done to address them. Then subsequent posts will focus in more detail on particular components and the work that has been done and what should be done in the future.]]></summary>

	If you haven't been following this, this feature will track the web

	will share with web pages whenever they ask, and it's built
	directly into the Chrome browser. It's been in the news previously
	as "FLoC" and then the "Topics API," and despite widespread
	opposition from just about every non-advertiser in the world,
	Google owns Chrome and is one of the world's biggest advertising
	companies, so this is being railroaded into the production builds.


For those who use Chrome anyway, there are instructions on how to disable
this functionality.]]></summary>

微软公司的法律事务总顾问表示，只要客户使用了他们在产品中内置的防护栏和内容过滤器，《微软 Copilot 版权承诺》将为客户提供保护。微软还承诺支付相关罚款或和解金，并表示已采取措施确保其 Copilot 尊重版权。他说，“我们向商业客户收取 Copilot 的费用，如果他们的使用产生了法律问题，我们应该把这个问题变成我们自己的问题，而不是客户的问题。”

老王点评：这是应有之义，为客户使用 AI 提供了信心。




Bcachefs 合并再生波折

在冲击 Linux 6.5 失败后，Bcachefs 再次向 Linux 6.6 发起了合并请求。但 Linus Torvalds 突然发现，不但 Bcachefs 的拉取请求没有使用带有 PGP 密钥和信任链的签名 Git 标签，更严重的是，它没有先进入 linux-next 树。这个事情让 Linus 感到烦恼，并警告 Bcachefs 不要“无视所有基本规则”，“如果你真的想把它合并到上游，就必须与上游合作。” Linus 说，“这一点不容讨价还价”，否则就“继续在主内核树之外做十年的开发工作吧”。并且，Linus 还发现 Bcachefs 会出现编译器错误，这本来应该通过 linux-next 的审核更容易地发现。


消息来源：Phoronix



老王点评：Linus 本来是乐于看到 Bcachefs 进入内核的，但是现在看起来“不守规矩”的 Bcachefs 很难在这个窗口进入 Linux 6.6 了。




Ubuntu 新增 TPM 支持的全磁盘加密功能

尽管没有集成可信平台模块（TPM），Ubuntu 多年来一直提供全磁盘加密支持。下个月发布的 Ubuntu 23.10 将实验性地引入对基于 TPM 的全磁盘加密的初步支持。但这个实验性的功能依赖于备受争议的 Snap 打包格式，引导加载器和内核将作为 Snap 包交付，而不是作为 Debian 包交付。并且，Ubuntu 还将使用统一内核镜像（UKI），将内核和 initramfs 封装在一个 PE 二进制文件中。


消息来源：Phoronix



老王点评：我既不喜欢 TPM，也不喜欢 Snap，更不喜欢统一内核镜像。真是难得集齐了。]]></summary>

 Apple has different apps, I don't really get why, I couldn't understand ISA really and it goes over my head. Shouldn't there be several abstraction layers between apps and ISAs, so that apps work regardless of the different architecture underneath? Or has the app porting in apple been required because of a different file structure between iOS and MacOS?

“人工智能的独特之处也是最令人恐惧和值得庆祝的地方，是它能够匹配我们自己的一些技能，然后走得更远，完成人类无法完成的事情。人工智能模仿人类行为的能力已成为其具有定义性质的特征。然而，机器学习和大型语言模型的每一次进步背后实际上都是人，既是经常被忽视的、使大型语言模型使用起来更安全的人类劳动力，又是在何时以及如何最好地使用这项技术方面做出关键决定的个人。”当地时间9月7日，《时代》杂志主编萨姆·雅各布斯（Sam Jacobs）写道，《时代》最擅长报道人物，这让他们想到推出TIME100 AI名单。


这份名单包括该杂志评选出的100位人工智能领域最具影响力的人物，共分为4个类别。


在领导者（Leaders）类别中，有OpenAI首席执行官山姆·奥特曼（Sam Altman），百度公司首席执行官、董事长兼联合创始人李彦宏，xAI创始人埃隆·马斯克（Elon Musk），创新工场董事长兼首席执行官李开复，英伟达联合创始人、首席执行官兼总裁黄仁勋等知名人物，以及Google DeepMind首席执行官兼联合创始人德米斯·哈萨比斯（Demis Hassabis），DeepLearning.AI创始人吴恩达（Andrew Ng），企业家兼投资人马克·安德森（Marc Andreessen）等业界大牛。

陈建华在《爱与真的启示：张爱玲的晚期风格》一书里，以《小团圆》为重点，细细梳理了张爱玲的晚期写作。这个晚期，他界定的是张1972年移居洛杉矶到去世为止，从五十二到七十六岁的二十多年间。为何不讲“后期”却说“晚期”呢？作者说“受到萨义德论文的启发，在于凸显张爱玲与世界文学的一个精神链接，即指出其《对照记》与意大利小说家兰佩杜萨的《豹》异曲同工，在揭露没落阶级的衰败与幻灭方面均具‘最后的贵族’的自传性质”。然而他意犹未尽添加一句“这在稍后（注：指晚于《对照记》）出土的《小团圆》中表现得极为震撼与深刻，恐怕不只是‘日益增强的疏离、流放与反历史的感受’”。这一点不只是，不只在哪里呢？

兰佩杜萨的《豹》

整一本书正是对这一点“不只是”的娓娓道来。萨义德的遗文《思考晚期风格》，纵论莎士比亚、贝多芬、瓦格纳、易卜生等文艺巨匠的晚年与创作，尤其是对意大利小说家兰佩杜萨及其小说世界的勾画，唤醒了陈建华重新审视张爱玲几乎被定论为创作力枯萎的不堪晚境。既以“爱与真”为名，对这两个最普遍又宏大难言的词的论证，就构成了此书最核心的任务。洋洋洒洒的为文，都是奔赴此二字而去。而这一场奔赴，又被陈建华放置在萨义德强调的“不合时宜与反常”的晚期风格舞台上恣意演出。

萨义德的《论晚期风格》

这出戏的第一幕，是陈建华对张爱玲与时间抵牾的晚作《小团圆》的阐释和理解。这是一部搁置了二十年，一面世就是王炸的小说：不是因为获得赞誉，而是因为自揭家丑，它改变了张爱玲长期的形象，改变了张学的游戏规则，使整个张学产业为之挪移换位。此前已经定型的种种盛名之下的印象、标签，因为这本自传小说都给打翻了。人们纷纷重新找词，为自己找一个立脚地。陈建华说：“《小团圆》颠覆了闺秀类型，即她长期打造的自我镜像…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[我们能否在 Arch Linux 中通过主流的桌面环境或窗口管理器来全面运行 Wayland？一起来探索答案。


Wayland 是一种针对 Linux 运行图形应用的高效、现代化的协议。相较之下，它在安全、稳定和图形性能方面相较老旧的 X.Org 显示服务器表现更出色。

尽管 X.Org 多年来一直是默认的显示服务器，但其年代漫长且复杂度高，导致了许多问题，包括安全漏洞和对新型硬件的兼容性问题。而 Wayland 提供了一个更简洁和安全的显示协议，用以解决这些问题。

虽然向 Wayland 转型已经有近十年的时间，但这是可以理解的。大型 Linux 发行版，例如 Ubuntu 和 Fedora，自 2021 年起就默认使用 Wayland，因为该协议现已逐渐稳定。

然而，对 Arch Linux 用户来说，使用 Wayland 进行自定义安装可能会比较复杂。在所有主流桌面环境中，只有 KDE Plasma 和 GNOME 有最新的 Wayland 支持。Xfce、LXQt 及其他桌面环境正在开发支持 Wayland 的功能，但现在还没有做好准备。

在窗口管理器方面，Sway 在 Arch Linux 中已经全面支持 Wayland。尽管如此，我还是希望能测试 Wayland 在 Arch 中的表现，并给你提供一个截至今日的状态报告。

让我们来尝试在 Arch Linux 中配置 KDE Plasma 和 GNOME 以全面支持 Wayland。

Arch Linux 中的 Wayland 设置

在理想的情况下，你应已经安装了 基础的 wayland 包。打开一个终端，并通过运行下列命令进行核实：

pacman -Qi wayland


如果你尚未安装，则可以使用以下命令进行安装：

sudo pacman -S --neede…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey there HN!
I wanted to share a pet project of mine. I built HackYourNews [1] to scratch a personal itch: Knowing which stories to focus on while browsing aimlessly (though there is a certain joy in that, as well!)
HackYourNews uses OpenAI's gpt-3.5-turbo to summarize the destination article as well as the comments section. Summarization of the article is always cached, while summaries of the comments are regenerated if the comments count is >10% (or >10 comments) different.
While I styled the homepage to welcome HNers, my preferred view is the Mobile view, accessed from the navbar. This no-frills view honors OS-level dark mode and is easy to skim on any device.
Tried to keep the site minimal. The only JS is Cloudflare's privacy-preserving analytics [2], just to gauge interest.
This is the first time I'm releasing something to the wild.
Hope you find this useful!
The frontend is pure HTML+CSS.
The backend is NodeJS (Puppeteer) + Python with the excellent Microsoft Guidance [3] library to interface to OpenAI's API.

 What is PodComb? 
 Fundamentally it performs one simple task: It combines an image and an audio clip into a video. I did this so that I could turn my "podcast" into video form to put into YT and figured that learning a bit about GTK4 programming would be interesting, so I decided to make my own app for it. The application is open sourced under the MIT license.

 How does it work?
 You select an image file by clicking the relevant button and you do the same for an audio file. Then you click combine, save the file and it will process the video for you.
 Features
  
Combines an image and an audio file into a video
 Error management to prevent crashes and such
 Automatic deletion of partial files if the processing is stopped midway by the user

detailed article on plans to add full-disk encryption, with the key
stored in the system's trusted platform module (TPM), to the desktop
distribution.


	In order to deliver these benefits, the implementation of
	TPM-backed FDE relies on two main design principles. First, it
	seals the FDE secret key to the full EFI state, including the
	kernel command line. Second, access to the decryption key will only
	be permitted if and when the device boots software that has been
	defined as authorised to access the confidential data.  This is
	when the initrd code will unseal the key in the secure-boot
	protected kernel.efi at boot time.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[以下是一个简单的编程项目，能够帮助你开始学习 Tcl/Tk。


探索 Tcl/Tk 的基础构造，包括用户输入、输出、变量、条件评估、简单函数和基础事件驱动编程。

我写这篇文章的初衷源于我想更深入地利用基于 Tcl 的 Expect。这让我写下了以下两篇文章：通过编写一个简单的游戏学习 Tcl 和 通过编写一个简单的游戏学习 Expect。

我进行了一些 Ansible 自动化工作，逐渐积累了一些本地脚本。有些脚本我频繁使用，以至于以下循环操作变得有些烦人：


打开终端

使用 cd 命令跳转至合适的目录

输入一条带有若干选项的长命令启动所需的自动化流程


我日常使用的是 macOS。实际上我更希望有一个菜单项或者一个图标，能够弹出一个简单的界面接受参数并执行我需要的操作，这就像在 Linux 的 KDE 中一样。

经典的 Tcl 类书籍都包含了关于流行的 Tk 扩展的文档。既然我已经深入研究了这个主题，我尝试着对其（即 wish）进行编程。

虽然我并非一名 GUI 或者前端开发者，但我发现 Tcl/Tk 脚本编写的方式相当直接易懂。我很高兴能重新审视这个 UNIX 历史的古老且稳定的部分，这种技术在现代平台上依然有用且可用。

安装 Tcl/Tk

对于 Linux 系统，你可以按照下面的方式安装：

$ sudo dnf install tcl
$ which wish
/bin/wish


而在 macOS 上，你可以通过 Homebrew 来安装最新版的 Tcl/Tk：

$ brew install tcl-tk
$ which wish
/usr/local/bin/wish


编程理念

许多编写游戏的教程都会介绍到典型的编程语言结构，如循环、条件判断、变量、函数和过程等等。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[根据 Asymco 机构分析师贺拉斯・德迪欧（Horace Dediu）发布的最新报告，苹果 iPhone 用户在应用上的平均支出，是安卓用户的 7.4 倍，远高于此前提出的 4 倍观点。


德迪欧表示：苹果声称有 6.5 亿活跃 App Store 用户，而谷歌声称有 25 亿活跃用户。这使得全球比例接近 Android 的 4 倍。收入之间的比率保持非常稳定，2016 年苹果与谷歌的收入比率为 29：15（1.93），2022 年为 81：42（1.93）。因此，我们可以通过将全球收入数除以全球用户数来比较两个平台的每个用户的应用收入。所以 iPhone 用户的价值是安卓用户的 7.4 倍。


德迪欧还对苹果推出 Vision Pro 头显表示乐观，认为这可能会产生 10 倍的支出差异。

As such, it is the Snapd agent which will be responsible for managing full disk encryption throughout its lifecycle."

上月底，由于不明原因的系统故障，日本丰田不得不停止其 12 家汽车装配厂的运营，造成每天大约 1.3 万辆汽车的产量损失。现在丰田公布了故障原因：磁盘满了。丰田在声明中称，8 月 27 日的例行维护工作是整理数据库中的数据并删除零散数据，但在完成任务之前存储空间已被填满，因此导致系统关闭。这直接影响了该公司的生产订购系统，从而无法计划和执行生产任务。并且，由于其主服务器和备份机器在同一个系统上运行。因此，两个系统都面临同样的故障，无法进行切换。两天后，丰田的工程师们准备了更大容量的服务器解决了该故障，恢复了生产。

老王点评：磁盘满这件事不只是办公室文员会遇到，就连大型生产系统都会遇到。




严重超支的甲骨文 ERP 系统压倒了伯明翰市政府

欧洲最大的地方政府伯明翰市政府宣布破产，其主要原因是这个产值达 43 亿美元的政府机构无法平衡账本，同时又需要支付高达 9.54 亿美元的同工同酬补贴。该市议会在声明中表示，其实施的甲骨文项目也是陷入困境的原因之一。自 2018 年以来，该市一直在努力实施一个 IT 项目，以替换 SAP 作为核心的人力资源和财务功能。但在该项目遭受了延迟、超支和控制不足的问题后，项目成本从 2000 万英镑激增到约 1 亿英镑。2021 年，甲骨文曾表示，伯明翰市议会是将大型 SAP ERP 客户迁移到 Oracle Fusion 的多个成功案例之一。


消息来源：The Register



老王点评：原本寄希望于好的 IT 系统能提升效率和收益，但是却倒在了实施的过程中。似乎经常听说因为实施 ERP 而走下坡路甚至倒闭的企业，这真是一个无底洞啊。




一家 3D AI 初创公司实际上是由人类手动建模

3D 建模是一项耗时的工作，一家 AI 公司承诺利用机器学习将客户的二维插图转换成三维模型。实际上，这家名为 Kaedim 的公司使用人类艺术家进行 “质量控制”。据知情人士透露，Kaedim 曾一度使用人类艺术家制作模型。其中一位消息人士说，有一次，工人们在完全没有机器学习帮助的情况下，自己制作了 3D 设计全图。此事曝光之后，该公司对其网站进行了改版，更清楚地表明人类参与了公司 3D 图像的制作，因为他们的“人工智能制作的图像质量很低”，需要人工进行“质量控制”。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[当你的桌面系统缺乏网络摄像头和专用麦克风时，你可以考虑使用智能手机。这里将教你如何在 Ubuntu Linux 中完成这个设置。


我和许多 Linux 用户一样，使用的是台式机。相较于笔记本电脑，并没有预装摄像头和麦克风。

若要获得与现代智能手机相媲美的画质，你可能需要购买一款高端的网络摄像头。

在此教程中，我将逐步指导你如何将你的手机用作麦克风和摄像头，这将非常适用于在线会议场景。

Ubuntu 下使用手机的摄像头和麦克风


🚧 本教程采用第三方网站 https://vdo.ninja/ 来托管音频和视频，因此，这并不是一项完全的开源方案。


我将指引你完成以下步骤：


安装 OBS （如果你还未安装）

通过 vdo.ninja 生成邀请链接

设置虚拟音频线缆（用于音频输出）

配置 OBS 以便从 vdo.ninja 重定向音视频流


首先，我们来看第一步。


📋 虽然本教程是在 Ubuntu 系统下完成的，但我相信，这些同样可以在其他 Linux 发行版上实现。你只需为你的发行版安装所需的包即可。你可以自行尝试，看看效果如何。


1、在 Ubuntu 中安装 OBS

OBS（Open Broadcaster Software）是众多用于录制和直播视频的优秀软件之一，许多直播者都选择使用 OBS 在各个数字化平台进行直播。

幸运的是，OBS 已经包含在 Ubuntu 的默认仓库中，你可以通过以下命令来安装：

sudo apt install obs-studio


2、通过 VDO.ninja 生成直播邀请

在这一节，我将教你如何在 vdo.ninja 上生成一个直播邀请，进而从你的手机上开始直播音频和视频。

首先，访问 VDO.ninja 并点击 “创建可重用的邀请Crea…]]></summary>

2021年7月12日，在第七十四届戛纳国际电影节主竞赛单元上，由《彼得罗夫流感》改编的同名电影全球首映。尽管现实与幻想的切换令人目不暇接，但世界各大电影媒体的影评人对影片整体评价颇高，将其公认为一部富于表现力、深植于俄国土壤的魔幻现实主义影片，在其时新冠疫情暴发的背景下尤具现实意义。《好莱坞报道》称其为“对冬季城市地狱漫游的超现实主义解读，将人语喧哗、体裁杂糅及时空错乱与精神谄妄混合起来，营造了令人匪夷所思又欲罢不能的艺术效果”。另一家美国娱乐界报刊巨头《视相》（Variety）称其“如同一部视觉交响乐，利用情节复现将读者卷入疯狂的漩涡，透过流感的棱镜加以透视。以连贯的长镜头将人物从一个时空传输到另一个时空，对苏联时期的回忆与对当代俄罗斯的感受相互交织”。
本片导演基里尔·谢列布连尼科夫（1969-）是当代俄罗斯著名电影、戏剧、电视剧导演，以犀利的社会批判视角及丰富的长镜头场面调度而著称。在一次采访中他曾坦言，《彼得罗夫流感》对他而言意义重大：“这是一部非常俄罗斯，非常私人的电影，讲述了……恐惧，欢喜，爱与恨，愤怒与崇拜，孤独与梦想，讲述了拥有千篇一律童年的一代；但戛纳国际电影节的青睐表明，不同文化和不同经历的人能够体会同样的恐惧与孤独。”

电影《彼得罗夫的流感》俄罗斯版海报

谢列布连尼科夫对《彼得罗夫流感》一书情有独钟，将其盛赞为当代俄语文学中罕见的杰作。除电影之外，还将其搬上了戏剧舞台。戏剧版《彼得罗夫流感》非但表现形式及手法与电影迥异，在艺术解读上也另辟蹊径，以相对有限的舞台空间呈现出无比开阔的思想内涵：戏剧开场时成年彼得罗夫在电车上遭遇的那群疯子，原来不是别人，正是他幼年时在新年枞树联欢会上遇见的那群演员。
自然，电影和戏剧都属于对小说文本的艺术…]]></summary>

萨尔瓦多当代作家奥拉西奥·卡斯特利亚诺斯·莫亚（Horacio Castellanos Moya）——他被称作“后文学爆炸”时代的重量级作家——的小说《错乱》（Insensatez, 2004）是近年来国内的外国文学翻译中非常有分量的一部作品，虽然只是薄薄的一本小书。原书出版于2004年，中译本在去年出版之后，不到一年就第三次印刷，我在近日才读到。它无疑是比较受国内读者欢迎的，包括“澎湃”在内的重要媒体都发表过访谈、书评。读完小说《错乱》之后，想想近二十年来拉美、非洲的当代文学，从智利的波拉尼奥（Roberto Bolaño）、安哥拉的阿瓜卢萨（José Eduardo Agualusa）到萨尔瓦多的这位莫亚，真的是光彩夺目。说起拉美文学，不能再停留在“魔幻”了，“文学爆炸”之后的“后文学爆炸”更令人心惊，不再是因为魔幻的传奇或孤独。虽然莫亚在这本小说中也描述过“失去了十指的双手扶住他那碎成两半的脑袋，好让脑浆不流出来”，然后调侃地说“看，魔幻现实主义那套把戏我也不是不会嘛”（65页）。但是他不再以“这套把戏”作为观看和描述这个世界的重要工具了。莫亚说：“我们的现实与魔幻现实主义有什么关系？我们的现实并不是魔幻的。”（《拉美作家莫亚：暴力不是魔幻现实主义，而是现实》，《南方人物周刊》采访报道，2022-08-03）这句话很有现实感，同时也可以使人想起修辞的力量与弊端。由于“魔幻”，当年的拉美“文学爆炸”曾经在我们这里燃起了余焰，而“后爆炸”的“现实”在今天我们的文学中不知还能点燃什么？
根据该书译者的介绍，小说的故事应该是发生在中美洲的危地马拉，显然是在影射由危地马拉天主教会于1995年发起的“历史记忆恢复计划”（Recuper…]]></summary>

The King’s Harvest：A Political Ecology of China from the First Farmers to the First Empire


中译本《惟王受年：从农业起源到秦帝国的中国政治生态学》

这让我想起了三十年前骑行关中的几次难忘经历。我当时在准备西周（前1046—前771）文化的研究，有必要实地踏察西周的京畿。1992年夏，相随友人罗泰（Lothar von Falkenhausen）、李永迪，自西安出发，前往周原和周公庙，去往周人的故乡。我们在咸阳渡过渭河，再沿河谷西上，经过武功县，北转扶风县。到了周原后，我在工作中的发掘区漫步了一整天，对周原遗址的规模（仅十五平方公里）、对周原考古工作者所面临的挑战和机遇都有了…]]></summary>

Flathub 是获取和分发适用于所有 Linux 的应用的地方。它由 Flatpak 提供支持，允许 Flathub 应用在几乎任何 Linux 发行版上运行。

请阅读 “Flatpak 入门”。为了启用 Flathub 作为你的 Flatpak 提供商，请参照 Flatpak 站点 上的说明。

Flatseal

Flatseal 是一个图形程序，用于检查和修改 Flatpak 应用的权限。这是 Flatpak 世界中最常用的应用之一，它允许你提高 Flatpak 应用的安全性。然而，它需要谨慎使用，因为会让你的权限过于开放。

使用起来非常简单：只需启动 Flatseal，选择一个应用，然后修改其权限即可。进行更改后重新启动应用。如果出现任何问题，只需按重置按钮即可。

你可以通过单击网站上的安装按钮或手动使用以下命令来安装 Flatseal：

flatpak install flathub com.github.tchx84.Flatseal


你也可以在 Fedora 的仓库中找到它的 RPM 包。

Reco

flatpak install flathub com.github.ryonakano.reco


Mini Text

Mini Text 是一个非常小且简约的文本查看器，具有最少的编辑功能。它是一个对要粘贴的文本的进行编辑地方，它没有保存功能。它使用 GTK4，其界面与 GNOME 很好地集成。

我发现这对于保留我想要粘贴到任何地方的数据非常有用，它没有不需要的和/或不需要的富文本功能，只是具有最少编辑功能的纯文本。

你可以通过单击网站上的安装按钮或使用以下命令手动安装 Mini Text：

flatpak install flathub io.github.nokse22.minitext


Tagger

Tagger 是一个音乐标签编辑器，适合我们这些仍然在本地保存音乐的人。

其中一些功能是：


一次编辑多个文件的标签和专辑封面，甚至跨子文件夹。

支持多种音乐文件类型（mp3、ogg、flac、wma 和 wav）。

轻松将文件名转换为标签，将标签转换为文件名。


你可以通过单击网站上的安装按钮或手动使用以下命令来安装 Tagger：

flatpak install flathub org.nickvision.tagger

protect module objects (and users) from mistaken attribute assignment and

There are ways

performance penalty for an unrelated, and heavily used, action: attribute
lookup on modules.  Back in 2017, PEP 562 ("Module __getattr__

a new proposal would extend that idea to add __setattr__() and

        <id>https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37409413</id>
        <link href="https://github.com/ddosify/alaz"/>
        <updated>2023-09-06T18:52:07.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello Everyone,
I'm excited to introduce a new open-source observability platform and would love to hear your feedback.
We are aware that there are lots of open-source/commercial tools out there. However, we believe that monitoring the clusters and extracting actionable insights requires deep know-how about the tools/domain. We mainly focused on this problem.
- Alaz is an eBPF agent installed on your K8s cluster as DaemonSet. Thanks to eBPF, Alaz collects traces directly from Linux kernels. This means there's no need for sidecars, instrumentations, or service restarts.
- The UI not only visualizes data but also provides actionable insights. Using the Service Map, you can:
  - View latencies and RPS between services.
  - Detect zombie services and underperforming SQL queries.
  - Monitor golden signals, such as 5xx status codes.

Setting up is straightforward: just install Alaz as a DaemonSet, and the platform will handle the rest.
Finally, the combination of Alaz and Ddosify Performance Testing makes it possible to do load testing and simultaneously monitor the system to find bottlenecks instantly.
For those interested, check out Alaz on GitHub: https://github.com/ddosify/alaz
Your feedback would be greatly appreciated!

        <id>https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37407758</id>
        <link href="https://github.com/pdtpartners/nix-snapshotter"/>
        <updated>2023-09-06T16:54:29.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello! This is Edgar and Robbie and we built nix-snapshotter. nix-snapshotter brings native understanding of Nix packages to containerd.
We built this because Nix is a great fit for making efficient containers. They don't need an OS because Nix captures all dependencies exactly. However, the current process of creating Nix images is subpar because one needs to transform Nix packages into a format that container runtimes understand.
Using nix-snapshotter, instead of downloading image layers, packages come directly from the Nix store. Packages can be fetched from a binary cache or built on the fly if necessary. All existing non-Nix images continue to be supported, and Nix layers can be interleaved with normal layers.
nix-snapshotter also provides a CRI image service, which allows Kubernetes to resolve image manifests from Nix directly too. This enables for the first time, fully declarative Kubernetes resources, all the way down to the image specification and its contents. With this, you can even run pure Nix images without a Docker Registry at all, if you wish.
We'd love for you to try it out, there is a one-liner for Nix users to boot a VM with everything pre-configured: https://github.com/pdtpartners/nix-snapshotter

	more personal data than necessary and uses that information for a

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I remember a reading a story a while ago that in the early of days of Google when Sergei Brin and Larry page wanted to scale up, they went to Microsoft which quoted them a ridiculous price for 20 Windows servers. 
 Instead they went off and created their own custom Linux which allowed them to scale up quickly to thousands of machines. Without Linux there would have been no Google.
 This was in the time when Linux was still considered to be cancer and their choice of using Linux was cutting edge.
 Am I remembering this story correctly or is my brain playing tricks with me?

It just puts the binaries in user writable directory and adds them to the execution PATH.
 As far as I know there is no package manager for Linux that works that way.
 For example I might not care about updating to the latest kernel, but I want the latest Firefox ...
 Can we come up with a way to do this with Linux?

谷歌一直在逐步推出 Chrome 浏览器的 “增强广告隐私” 功能。除非关闭该功能，否则网站可以根据用户的浏览器历史记录，针对用户的在线活动和兴趣投放广告。七月发布的 Chrome 115 支持谷歌的 “主题 API” 以来，一些用户的浏览器弹出窗口开始显示这项功能，而 “主题 API” 是谷歌隐私沙盒项目的一部分。Chrome 用户可能会认为他们接受或启用了 “增强的” 隐私保护功能，而实际上是启用了 “主题 API”，并会一直启用，除非在浏览器设置中手动禁用。也就是说，这个弹出窗口只是一个通知，告诉你已经被选中接受这种广告。


消息来源：The Register



老王点评：谷歌是把“免费才是最贵的”玩的最明白的，免费的 Chrome 浏览器，背后是极致的广告潜力挖掘。




安卓 14 将禁止对系统证书的修改

最初，安卓系统允许用户创建自己的 CA 并信任它，从而可以拦截设备上的 HTTPS 流量，查看设备上正在发送和接收的内容，也可以进行修改或阻止。但从谷歌 2016 年发布的安卓 7 开始，设备上的信任 CA 列表就分为两个部分：系统固定的用于所有应用的 CA，和用户可以修改但仅能用于特定应用的 CA 证书。这既保护了普通用户安全，也为那些有专门需要的技术人员提供了方便。但在最新的安卓 14 中，将进一步限制对系统证书的修改，它将 CA 证书的管理转移到了一个独立更新的组件，由谷歌 Play 商店提供更新。这对于普通用户来说会更安全，但另一方面它进一步限制了开发者，即使被完全 root 的设备也无法修改系统证书。

老王点评：如果你想调试自己的 HTTPS 流量，你需要坚持使用安卓 13。




Mozilla 称汽车是数据隐私的噩梦

众所周知，智能手机、可穿戴设备、智能门铃等会收集隐私数据，但 Mozilla 基金会发现，对你的隐私最严重的威胁可能是你的汽车。它对包括奔驰、林肯、日产、大众、本田、特斯拉等在内的 25 家主要汽车制造商的隐私政策和做法进行了评估，发现所有汽车制造商都没有通过消费者隐私测试，因此获得了“毫无隐私（PNI）”警告标签。Mozilla 警告说，它们利用的可能远不止位置历史记录、驾驶习惯、车载浏览器历史记录和音乐偏好，甚至包括一些深层次的个人数据，例如性活动、移民身份、种族、面部表情、体重、健康状况，甚至基因信息。在其调查的 25 家汽车制造商中，有 21 家表示可以与服务提供商、数据经纪商等共享客户信息，有 19 家表示可以出售个人数据。

如果我告诉你，你能将完整的 Ubuntu 系统装载在一个可移动的 U 盘上，你会有何感想？

在外置 U 盘上 安装 Ubuntu 过程相当复杂。一种更容易的方法是制作一个带有持久化存储的 立付Live U 盘，这样你对 U 盘做出的改动都会被保存下来。

请相信我，这个过程跟使用 BalenaEtcher 或其他任何刻录工具创建可引导驱动器的过程十分相似。

然而，我们在开始之前，让我们先弄清楚持久化立付 U 盘是什么。

什么是持久化立付 U 盘？

当你使用立付 Linux U 盘时，你在 立付会话Live session 中做出的所有更改，在重启以后都将丢失。比如，你必须重新连接 Wi-Fi，并且你下载的文件及安装的应用均不会被保留。而持久化立付 U 盘将会为你保存这些所有的更改。

这样，你就可以将该 U 盘作为一个外置操作系统使用，它将会保存你所做出的所有更改，比如创建用户账号，安装软件包，和一切你通常在电脑上做的事情。

当然，保存的文件数量将取决于你使用的 U 盘的大小！

但你已经明白我要表达的意思了吧。那么，我们开始学习如何创建一个带有持久性的 Ubuntu 立付 U 盘吧。

如何创建一个持久化的 Ubuntu U 盘

在这个教程中，我将引导你完成一个持久化的 Ubuntu U 盘的制作过程：


通过在 Windows 上的 Rufus 工具

或者，通过在 Linux 上的 mkusb 工具


你可以参照教程中的适合你的部分。


📋 本教程中，你将会创建一个 Ubuntu 的持久化 U 盘。并非所有的 Linux 发行版都支持数据的持久化存储，所以这个方法可能并非所有的发行版本适…]]></summary>

日本学者斋藤幸平的《人类世的“资本论”》中文译本，新近在国内出版。据报道，这本书于2020年9月出版，至2023年年初，在日本销量超过五十万册。一些日本媒体据此认为，日本社会正掀起一股马克思主义风潮，斋藤幸平被很多人誉为新一代马克思主义代言人。
“人类世 ”（Anthropocene）是一个不大常用且很隐晦的词，日文译为“人新世”，它是由诺贝尔奖得主、荷兰大气化学家保罗·克鲁岑于2000年提出的，意为人类活动的痕迹完全覆盖整个地球表面的年代。
斋藤幸平生于1987年，2015年从德国柏林洪堡大学获得了哲学博士学位，论文题目是《自然反对资本：马克思的生态学——未竟的资本主义批判》。读博士期间，他参与了编辑《马克思恩格斯全集》历史考证版第二版（MEGA2）的工作，阅读了很多马克思研究生态环境问题的相关资料。2017年，斋藤幸平以博士论文为基础，在美国出版了《卡尔·马克思的生态社会主义：资本主义、自然与未竟的政治经济学批判》一书，跻身于西方生态马克思主义学派青年学者之列。
自二十世纪六七十年代西方国家环境问题引起全世界关注以来，“马克思是否有生态思想”这个问题在马克思主义思想传统内外激起热烈的争论。从西方生态马克思主义思想内容看，其理论路径体现为两个方面：其一，是回到马恩文本，发掘其中的生态哲学内蕴，并在此基础上对马克思主义进行某种生态思想维度的辩护；其二，西方生态马克思主义也抱有一种发展马克思主义或重构马克思主义的理念，即希望将生态这一维度引入马克思主义的传统中。毕竟，在马克思的时代，生态学也不过是刚刚起步的新科学，生态环境也没有遭遇到今天这样的危机。因此，生态马克思主义所进行的理论建构是将马克思主义作为一种视角和方法，来审视生态环境的诸多问题（《西方生态马克思主义的发展与当代嬗变》，中国社会科…]]></summary>

该脚本按照以下步骤收集和打印这些信息。


它收集系统上活动 “磁盘组”（DG）的列表

查找与相应 DG 关联的 “设备名称”。

接下来，它列出了与各个设备映射的 “块设备”。

最后收集与这些块设备关联的 LUN ID 并将它们全部打印在一起，如 DG 名称、块设备名称和 LUN 编号。

 Edit: After reading all of your comments I appreciate this community and people here so helpful and supportive I should consider using windows as well for not limiting my knowledge and work I'll try using WSL as many suggested this also try to learn powershell... thank you all for the guidance.

《本草纲目》之名家喻户晓，但何为“本草纲目”，却是一个需要解释的“通识性”问题。2016年，科学出版社曾组织出版《本草纲目研究集成》，从《导读》《详注》《图考》《研究札记》等方面深入地介绍了《本草纲目》。不过，对一般读者来说，阅读如此巨制并不容易。《〈本草纲目〉通识》（以下简称《通识》，引用仅标注页码）一书的主要目标群体应是“从事传统医药行业以外的读者”，读罢可对《本草纲目》的文献结构与李时珍的学术思路有大概了解。与先前诸种“导读”书籍不同，《通识》并没有就药理、药物来介绍《本草纲目》，更多是从文化观念上清本溯源，使普通读者也能够对“本草”系列丛书的流与变有所知悉，以观历史的层累与文化的碰撞。
王家葵教授深耕本草领域多年，这本《通识》小书，从一张李时珍邮票谈起，简洁明了地道出现今对李时珍以及《本草纲目》的误读，即“本草”并不等同于“药用植物”，李时珍也绝非仅仅是“辑”成了《本草纲目》。
本书前两章，分别解“本草”与“纲目”。
李约瑟说“明代最伟大的科学成就即《本草纲目》，是为本草系列著作的巅峰”（260页）。这里提及，本草有“系列著作”。而要想评判《本草纲目》，必先知其源流。本书的第一章即着力于此。这一章重点拎出一条主线，即“综合类大型本草”的发展始末，末了补充主线外的“旁系”，读罢可知本草来龙去脉。关于本草“主流”与“旁支”的分类说法，实际上也有其学术源流，李约瑟、白井光太郎、郑金生等人都对此有进一步的解释。《通识》一书的重点自然是在“主流”，即《神农本草经》-《本草经集注》-《新修本草》-《证类本草》-《本草纲目》等之间的起承转合。不过，知识文化的变迁往往不能只看官家，所谓的“旁系”之中，隐藏着许多有关知识在地化与日常接受的提示。比如，从使用者的角度讲，有诸如《通识》中提到的“药学类手…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Nitrux 3.0 正式发布，带来核心级别的改进。在这查看详情。


作为 Linux 发行版中最美观的系统 之一，Nitrux 以其精美的用户界面和强大的不变性功能吸引着大家。

自我们上一次了解 Nitrux已经过了 一段时间。根据最近的公告，Nitrux 3.0 在系统底层加入了许多优化。

下面我们简单回顾一下这次的更新内容。

🆕 Nitrux 3.0：有何新亮点？



Nitrux 3.0 基于 Linux 内核 6.4.12-2-liquorix，这是一个旨在提升系统响应速度的 Linux 内核，Nitrux 3.0 专注于 提升性能、硬件兼容性以及 核心应用的更新。

本次发布的重点改进包括：


MauiKit 的更新

系统更新的优化

桌面环境的升级


MauiKit 的更新



Nitrux 3.0 版本中包括了最近发布有许多性能提升，以及为 Qt6 迁移打基础的 MauiKit 和 Maui 框架 3.0.1。

这也包括了 更新后的应用，如 MauiKit FileBrowsing、MauiKit TextEditor、MauiKit Calendar、MauiKit Documents 和 MauiKit Terminal。

他们也 针对 MauiKit 3.0.1 调整了 Maui Apps 和 NX 软件中心。你可以在 此处 查看更多关于 MauiKit 的更新信息。

推荐阅读 📖


11 个面向未来、不可变 Linux 发行版


OS 更新的优化

Nitrux 更新工具系统 更新到了 1.1.3 版本。这次更新带来了两个主要变化：

首先，kexec 相关的代码被移除，因为现在有了 “内核引导Kernel Boot”。

其次是新的 “急救” 功能，作为一种在没有意料到的事件中，如导致根目录不一致和无法使用的中断，确保备份冗余的方式。

这项新功能旨在让用户在活动会话中恢复根分区，以便于从这种情况中恢复。

桌面环境升级



在桌面环境方面，Nitrux 3.0 集成了 KDE Plasma 5.27.7 并进行了一些优化。

现在，NX 桌面新增了一个可以重启 Plasma 的选项，修复了与 “自动登录” 功能相关的一些问题，并且现在英伟达 X 服务器设置能正确显示 GPU 的信息了。

🛠️ 其它的变更和优化

除此之外，本版本还包括一些其它的更新，最显著的有：


集成了 Firefox 117

更新至 MESA 23.3~git2309020600.1ae3c4~oibaf~j，这是一个测试版的版本。

针对影响英特尔和 AMD 处理器的 Downfall 和 Inception 硬件漏洞的 安全补丁。

加入了一个检查以 确认英伟达专有驱动的存在，从而在使用英伟达硬件的设备上不使用“内核引导”功能。

Nitrux 的 Calamares 配置进行了优化，比如移除了一个已弃用的内核参数，为默认的图形会话启用 “自动登录” 等等。


请查阅官方 公告博客，和 发布说明 了解更多关于本版本以及如何更新已有安装的详情。

provides a repository where vendors can upload firmware updates that can be
accessed by the fwupd
firmware update daemon on Linux systems.  That mechanism allows users to keep
the hardware components of their systems up to date with the latest firmware
releases, but it has gotten so 
popular that the daily metadata queries are starting to swamp the LVFS
content delivery network (CDN) server.  So Richard Hughes, who developed
fwupd and LVFS, suggested
that it would make sense to start looking at ways to reduce that burden;

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello! This is Jeane and Samuel and we’re building RecipeUI. RecipeUI is an open source Postman alternative that uses TypeScript to statically type and autocomplete requests.
We built this because current API tools don’t deal with the fact that some APIs are just painful to work with. For us, it’s usually error after error as we try to figure out how to properly form the first request.
We recorded a demo to show you how TypeScript helps us autocomplete a request correctly.
https://youtu.be/O_Mly_p-g5s
How does our platform improve the developer experience? The analogy is similar to using a statically typed language vs dynamically typed. Most API tools are dynamically typed. You’re guessing the params and relying on the request to magically work at runtime, only for you to go back to stack overflow or the docs when it doesn’t.
We take the approach of defining parameters and the schema first. When you add a new parameter, you need to mention upfront if it’s required and what type it is (integer, string, boolean). While this can be painful in the beginning, it will save you and anyone you share this with the hassle of understanding how this API works.
Our app is cross-platform on web and desktop. Our desktop app is https://github.com/RecipeUI/RecipeUI.

As you know, serious vulnerabilities are common in IoT, and it often takes too long for these to be patched on end-user devices—if the manufacturer even bothers to release an update, and if the device was even designed to receive them. Companies may stop supporting a device well before consumers have stopped using it. The support period is often not communicated at the time of sale. And sometimes the end of support is not even announced, leaving even informed users unsure whether their devices are still safe.
I’ve advocated for the FCC to require device manufacturers to support their devices with security updates for…]]></summary>

苹果和微软是美国最有价值的公司之二，但它们认为自己的一些旗舰服务不够受欢迎，不足以成为欧盟为遏制大科技公司势力而制定的具有里程碑意义的新法规中的 “守门人”。欧盟将在周三公布首批受《数字市场法》监管的服务名单之前，与苹果公司就其 iMessage 和与微软就其必应搜索引擎是否够格进行讨论。

AWS 关闭其第一代计算和网络基础设施

AWS CTO 在其个人博客中透露，最后一个 EC2-Classic 实例已于 8 月 15 日关闭，这标志着运行了近 17 年的 EC2-Classic 结束了。AWS 让 EC2-Classic “一直活到每个实例关闭或迁移为止”。2006 年 AWS 推出弹性计算云（EC2）时，它是一个由 10.0.0.0/8 组成的巨大网络，所有实例都运行在一个与其他客户共享的扁平网络上，每个实例拥有相当于 1.7GHz 至强处理器的虚拟 CPU、1.75GB 内存、160GB 本地磁盘和 250 Mbps 网络带宽。他说，EC2-Classic “让获取计算的过程变得非常简单，尽管背后运行的堆栈复杂得令人难以置信”。


消息来源：The Register



老王点评：开创了云计算时代的云服务，就这样落幕了。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[GNOME 45 是一次重要的升级，但对扩展的影响并不令人满意！


每当 GNOME 升级，总会有一些扩展遭遇问题，这点并不新鲜。但如今，到了 GNOME 45，每个扩展都将面临问题！ 😱

那么，究竟是什么原因呢？让我为你解释一番。

GNOME 45 扩展的变化

每次升级，都意味着某种技术上的提升或者变化。

而 GNOME 45 带来了许多激动人心的更新，除了这一项。


GNOME 45 引入激动人心的更新


GNOME Shell 的 JavaScript 部分发生了变化。如果你还不清楚的话，你需要知道的是，JavaScript（以及相关的模块）负责扩展的用户界面，包括面板、菜单、对话框等。

技术上的变更主要在于，GNOME Shell 和扩展开始使用 ESModules，而不是 GJS 的自定义导入系统。

虽然这个变革旨在鼓励开发人员用更加标准化的方式来处理 GNOME Shell 和扩展的代码，但可能会造成大量困扰。

为什么呢？

那是因为旧有系统与新的模块系统存在不兼容问题。

以下是 Florian Müllner 在谈及这个技术问题时 提到 的：


模块加载的方式与脚本有所不同，有些语句，特别是 import 和 export，只在模块中有效。这就意味着，如果一个模块使用了这些语句（几乎是必然的），那么用旧系统导入这个模块就会出现语法错误。


那么问题影响范围呢？所有 GNOME 扩展都将受影响。


所有针对老版本 GNOME 设计的扩展将无法在 GNOME 45 上运行（除非迁移）。

专门为 GNOME 45 设计的新扩展，也无法在老版本上运行。


好消息是，GNOME 扩展的开发人员可以支持多版本的 GNOME，但他们将需要付出更多努力，为 GNOME 45 之前和之后的版本分别上传新的版本。

因此，即使开发人员选择了这样做，并使用 迁移指南 将他们的扩展移植到新系统中，这仍将花费他们更多的时间，而在此期间，终端用户（也就是我们）在使用 GNOME 45 时会遇到扩展无法运行的情况。

这并不是一个好的用户体验，对不对？ 😒

GNOME 的升级从未能完美处理扩展的兼容问题，现在，情况变得更糟。

虽然我并不太依赖现有的任何 GNOME 扩展，但很多用户在日常使用中都会用到。对他们来说，一个可能破坏使用体验的升级绝非喜事。

💬 你如何看待 GNOME 45 中对扩展的变动？在下方评论中分享你的想法吧。

这是大多数 Linux 管理员的例行活动，我们通常使用一些脚本来显示针对 SAN LUN 的块设备映射，然后我们将手动添加 LVM 和文件系统信息来完成操作。

今后，你无需手动干预此活动，因为这些信息可以通过 Shell 脚本进行映射，如下所示。

参考以下类似文章：

这个 Shell 脚本可帮助你识别哪些 SAN 磁盘映射到 Linux 上的哪些块设备、LV、VG 和文件系统。

请注意： 我们排除了 sda 磁盘，因为这是操作系统（OS）盘，它有多个分区。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[乔纳森·萨姆欣（章静绘）

乔纳森·萨姆欣（Jonathan Sumption，1948- ）是一位跨界奇人。他曾是世界顶级的辩护律师，于2012年至2018年间担任英国最高法院大法官；他是歌剧和古典音乐界的名人，担任英国皇家音乐学院理事；同时他是著名的中世纪历史学家，代表作为“英法百年战争”五部曲，其中前两部《战争的试炼》《烈火的审判》已由社科文献出版社甲骨文品牌推出中文版。他的历史著作还有《朝圣时代：中世纪的上帝之路》（The Age of Pilgrimage: The Medieval Journey to God）、《阿尔比十字军东征》（The Albigensian Crusade）等。
2023年7月，陆大鹏在伦敦格林尼治采访了萨姆欣，与他聊了英法百年战争和读书等话题。
首先祝贺您的“百年战争”系列第五卷出版，整个五部曲就算大功告成了。第一卷是1990年出版的，您花了三十多年时间，完成了这部鸿篇巨著。
萨姆欣：谢谢。不过不止三十多年。我从上世纪七十年代末开始写这部书，去年才完成，也就是一共花了四十多年。
我们从头聊起吧。我知道您的父亲是著名的律师，所以您从事法律工作有家学渊源。那么您是如何开始对历史，尤其是中世纪历史感兴趣的呢？
萨姆欣：我上中学（伊顿公学）的时候，历史课是从大约1500年讲起的，并没有涉及中世纪。我在中学课程里详细学习了从1500年到1900年的英格兰历史和欧洲历史。上牛津大学之后，我想学别的东西，想知道1500年之前的事情。所以我的本科专业选择了中世纪历史。1970年我本科毕业，几乎马上就成为我所在的莫德林学院的研究员，然后开始教书。
刚刚获得本科学位就成为学院的研究员，这是非常了不起的成就了。
萨姆欣：这种情况的确不算常见。作为莫德林学院的研究员，我主要从事研究工作，但也花了五年时间给本科生教中世纪历史。这是我自己读本科时很享受的专业。后…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[按：1930年代初，在两位年轻的历史学家陈恭禄与萧一山之间，围绕后者所著《清代通史》下卷，以天津《大公报·文学副刊》为主战场，发生了一场旷日持久、异常激烈的“文字战”。当年（1932），陈恭禄三十三岁，为金陵大学历史系讲师，萧一山三十一岁，为南京中央大学教授。论战过后，后者搜罗各方辩论文章，辑成《〈清代通史〉下卷讲稿辨论集》（北平中华印书局1934年8月版），并特作一长序，从自身立场回顾“辩论”始末，从一开始得见陈文，“闻而色喜”，鉴于“讨论之责任”而“竭诚答之”，到无法忍受对方“强诬狡赖”，进而“痛心国难，疾首士风”，不得不“浪费笔墨，详函申辨”，透露心态的曲折变化。这一场以“学术批评”为导火线而引发的笔墨官司，此来彼往，步步升级，生动呈现了民国学界生态的复杂面相，文字锋芒背后，蕴含当时学人之基础素养及各自汲引的思想学术资源，公共媒体性质的大报副刊为“书评”所提供的发表空间也充满了张力（详拙文《陈恭禄与萧一山笔战始末》，《南方周末》2023年8月4日）。陈恭禄书评从“论历史方法与史料”（举例十余）、“论作者应有之态度”（举例凡三）、“指正书中错误”（举例凡十）、“指摘别字”（举例凡四）等四方面立论。最后一项，萧一山既诿责于“校对疏忽”，辩解说“印讲义作者均不校对，一委诸印刷局手民，故别字连篇也”，此处也不再赘。惟前三项兹事体大，质言之，包含了史法、史料、史观及史事考辨，荦荦大端，多关系“史学根本问题”者，与萧一山诸反论合观比勘，足资启发。窃以为“中国近代史学科”发轫期的学术派分、暗中竞逐，在陈、萧二氏笔战文字中多有透露，藉此可窥1930年代学界主流、非主流各派在纠葛中并进的多元学风。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If the title didn't make it obvious... This isn't supposed to be a very serious post or anything, just a followup to an old post of mine. (That I'm sure nobody has even seen)
 About 1/4 of a year ago I got super hyperfixated on Linux. It was seriously unhealthy. I have ADHD so I naturally get some hyperfixation from time to time, but never had it been as bad as with linux.
 I would spend nearly the entire day in my room just messing around with linux. I had fun, sure, but I did nothing productive. I seriously mean nothing. I would just make setups, test distros, and other random stuff. I distro hopped a good 30 times within a two week span. HOW? I don't even know.
 I spent much less time with friends during this period and it seriously hurt some of my friendships. After settling with a distro, I got into ricing. Big mistake. Even more time spent messing with stuff. And I sucked at it! 
 From the beginning I knew it was unhealthy, but it took a while before I took control of myself. I had forced myself to stop, but it was hard. I uninstalled linux on all my systems, but I would go back. It was like a drug to me, and I don't even know why looking back. At some point, I just stopped. I had windows back on all my systems, and I never looked back. I would love to move back to linux for my primary system, but I don't want it to cause any more harm. I'm not planning on running linux as a daily OS for the near future, but I hope I can use it again at some point without losing my mind.
 Moral of the story, don't do linux. (Or just don't have an crazily unhealthy hyperfixation on it. I guess that works too...)

But I had an Ubuntu thumb stick nearby so I can still use my laptop for browsing the internet or w/e. It's quite amazing to be able to run an OS that way quickly and so easily. I don't know a lot of what it can do but maybe I can find some programs to diagnose my hardrive and try to fix it somehow... I'm looking into it atm.

 And having other things like architecture-related software like autoCAD,Lumion,Sketchup,etc would be nice to have just to convince to my coworkers to switch to linux 
 And improve the compatibility with LibreOffice with Office suite would be nice (not that libreoffice is a hazle to use with .docx files but sometimes the document its too complex to display it rigth in Libreoffice and viceversa
 I know that is a Microsoft problem but idk,it would be very nice to have better compatibility
 I know those examples are very unlikely,but its kinda fun just thinking about it

A few months ago, we introduced here at HN (https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34806482) Keep as an “open source alerting CLI” and got some interesting feedback - mainly around UI, automation, and supporting more tools. We were VERY early back then, and we understood that although the current DX around creating alerts is not great, it's not that critical and developers don’t need another tool just for that.
But we did find something else.
While talking to developers and devops, we found that a lot of companies use many tools that generate alerts - from Cloudwatch, Prometheus, Grafana, and Datadog to tools such as Zabbix or Nagios. We definitely agree consolidation in the observability space is a real thing, but while talking to those compani…]]></summary>

 Linsk is a first-of-its-kind tool that allows access to any Linux-native file systems on Windows and macOS, including LUKS and LVM (a killer feature). It originally started as a personal project for me as I wanted to have a truly cross-platform encryption for my external HDD. With time, I realized the potential this project has, and later, I decided to open-source it.
 There are a few existing solutions aiming to do the "same", like the famous Paragon software and other FUSE-based drivers with dubious quality. But all of these existing solutions have typically served as stopgaps, catering to users who occasionally access data on external drives with Linux fi…]]></summary>

苹果公司最新一轮的安全研究设备（SRD）计划已经开放申请，安全研究人员有机会获得解锁设备，并在苹果公司的许可下对其进行攻击和安全功能测试。这些解锁设备是“专门为安全研究设计的 iPhone 14 Pro 硬件变体”，可以配置或禁用 iOS 安全设置，安装和启动自定义内核缓存，运行任意级别的任意代码，设置 NVRAM 变量，甚至安装和启动自定义固件，以实现 iOS 17 的新安全功能。不过这些设备只供批准的申请者使用，并且禁止带出办公场所炫耀。苹果说，自 2019 年启动该计划以来，已经发现了 130 个具有重大影响的安全关键漏洞，多个奖项的奖金达到 50 万美元。

Windows 写字板应用谢幕

微软透露，自 1995 年以来一直随 Windows 提供的写字板“不再更新，并将在未来的 Windows 版本中删除”，但具体时间未定。微软建议使用 Word 来处理 .doc 和 .rtf 等富文本文档，使用 Windows 记事本来处理 .txt 等纯文本文档。多年来，写字板主要有两次重大更新：2001 年时在 Windows XP 中增加了打开 Word 文档的功能，2009 年时在 Windows 7 中增加了像 Word 一样的 Ribbon 用户界面。


消息来源：Thurrott



老王点评：Windows 自带应用中，除了扫雷、纸牌等几个游戏，其它的几个都比较凑合。




美国顶级域名 .US 是网络钓鱼域名最多的顶级域名

新研究显示，以美国顶级域名 .US 结尾的域名在网络钓鱼诈骗中最为常见，在 2022 年 5 月 1 日至 2023 年 4 月 30 日期间的 600 万份网络钓鱼报告中，发现了 3 万个 .US 网络钓鱼域名。有趣的是，.US 由美国政府监管，而美国政府经常是以 .US 结尾的钓鱼域名的目标。.US 域名只提供给美国公民和那些能证明他们在美国有实体存在的人。.US 域名的管理被外包给了 GoDaddy，但无论 GoDaddy 采取何种措施来管理该审查流程，都无法解决大量的钓鱼域名出现在 .US 域名中的问题。


消息来源：Krebs on Security



老王点评：我就说我怎么没见过 .US 域名的钓鱼邮件呢，原来是因为是不是美国人啊。😉

2004年，日本导演是枝裕和的电影《无人知晓》上映。该片以1988年东京巢鸭儿童遗弃事件为蓝本，讲述了四个遭父母遗弃的孩子艰难生活，最小的妹妹染病而死的悲惨故事。同年，非虚构作品《育儿放弃（忽视）：真奈小朋友为何死亡？》出版，这个故事里也有一个被父母放弃而死亡的小女孩（中译本题为《育儿放弃：被困住的母亲与被忽视的女儿》，以下简称《育儿放弃》）。我在读这本书时，脑中不断回放《无人知晓》的画面。《育儿放弃》和《无人知晓》的两个小女孩慢慢衰弱下去的身影交叠在一起，让人感到无比压抑和愤怒。

《无人知晓》海报

2000年12月10日，日本爱知县名古屋市近郊，刚满三岁的小女孩真奈被父母放入纸箱中近二十天，其间几乎没有进食，死去时体重只有五公斤，不到三岁孩子标准体重的四成。这对年仅二十一岁的父母，村田智则和村田雅美，被指控涉嫌蓄意谋杀，判处有期徒刑七年。案发时，真奈还有一个一岁半的弟弟，母亲雅美还怀有身孕，在公审期间又生下一个女儿。
自由撰稿人杉山春接受NHK教育频道的委托，以记者和调查员的身份查证为何政府部门已经注意到这个家庭有问题，却没能及时救助。杉山回顾道，她自己的孩子刚好比真奈大了一岁半，这使她在调查过程中经常无法保持客观，“越是近距离地接触案件，越是无法跳出母亲的视角”。她于是“以非虚构的写作手法大刀阔斧地修改书稿”，历经三年半调查和写作，终于还原了这桩骇人听闻的惨案（以下简称“真奈案”）的原貌。
杉山春1958年生于东京，曾任杂志记者，后成为自由撰稿人，从事非虚构写作。她的第一部作品是《育儿放弃》，出版后广受赞誉，荣获小学馆（出版社）非虚构大奖。之后，她依然对同类案件保持高度关注，分别于2013年和2016年出版了《纪实·虐待：大阪两儿童被弃置致死…]]></summary>

中国社科院拉美所谭道明老师组织的“真读书”读书会活动，有两期活动的主题是我去年（2022年）翻译的一本小书《阿根廷迷思》（Mitomanías argentinas），活动中聊到了决定翻译这本书的原因以及书名的翻译问题，实际上这两个问题是彼此联系的。原书的书名由两个单词组成，形容词“阿根廷的”问题不大，关键就在于“mitomanías”这个词，它与此书的内容是有呼应关系的，作者在那本书里列举了阿根廷的数十个“神话”，并一一加以揭秘和驳斥。此处的“神话”指的是众所周知、流传甚广但又不尽真实的传言。西班牙语中的“神话”一词为“mito”，恰好与表示“……癖”的后缀“-manía”组成了书名中的关键词。因此在翻译该书书名时，我们也的确考虑过《阿根廷“神话”》的译名，但终怕引发读者误解，遂改用“迷思”一词，既指阿根廷人对自己的迷思（“神话”产生的根源），也指外国人看待阿根廷的迷思（“神话”造成的后果）。
至于为何决定翻译那样一本书，是因为其中的两个“神话”打动了我：“拉丁美洲就是马孔多”和“阿根廷是欧洲国家？”。这两个“神话”都是我们在学校学习时便已生成的刻板印象。如今的我作为拉美文学的研究者，自然已经明白《百年孤独》中的马孔多不能代表拉丁美洲各个国家在各个时期的样子，可对于后一个“神话”，我却依然只留有十数年前精读课上老师半认真半戏言的讲解：“阿根廷人都认为自己不是拉美人，他们觉得自己的国土是从欧洲掉落到南美洲的……”了解“神话”、戳穿“神话”成了翻译那本书的最重要的驱动力。
一年之后，我的手里又捧起了另一本讲述“神话”的书，这次无论是作者还是译者都大胆地把这个关键词写进了书名里——《西班牙征服的七个神话（增订版）》（Seven Myths of th…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Flarum 可能是一个更好、更简单，或者说更具创新性的 Discourse 替代品。更多信息可在此处获取。新的一天，再来一次初次尝试😎。


这次，我们为你带来一个叫作 “Flarum” 的开源论坛软件，它可以作为 Discourse 的备选方案。它的目标是提供一个免费、快速且易于使用的简洁而具有可定制性的讨论平台。

Flarum 还具有很高的可扩展性 ，允许进行大量的自定义。

当然，我们可以拥有的开源选项越多越好，对吧？

让我们一起来看看它能提供什么。

Flarum 概述⭐



Flarum 是现已中止运营的 esoTalk 和 FluxBB 论坛软件套件的继任者。它以优化和快捷的性能为考量，提供了一整套良好的功能。

Flarum 主要使用 PHP 编程语言开发。它由志愿者进行维护和管理，并依赖于社区的贡献来推动其发展。

其主要亮点包括：


高度优化

响应式用户接口

移动优先设计

非常的灵活性



💡 Flarum 和 Discourse 使用了不同的技术栈，同时它们也有细微但实用的功能区别。

例如，Discourse 的时间线控制功能就是受到 Flarum 的启发。


初步印象 👨‍💻

我开始的测试是登录 Flarum 的 官方论坛，使用的是我的 GitHub 账户。

登录后我进入了 首页，那里展示了所有带有相关标签的讨论，并显示了各讨论的回复数。

顶部菜单具有通常的搜索栏，还有查看草稿、通知、带有用户名/头像的菜单以及一些重要设定的选项。



首页还包括一个侧边栏菜单，用户可以通过这个开始新的讨论、访问标签，或者查看私有讨论。

我必须说，我发现它和 Discourse 存在一些相似性，但这并不是什么坏事！

这里有一个让我熟悉的时间线滚动条，我可以用它跳转到帖子中的不同回复。



然后有一个 “关注Follow” 按钮，允许使用者选择三种独特的设置。其中一项是默认设置（没有任何通知），另一个是获得帖子通知，最后一个则是忽略某个帖子。



此后，我关注到用户如何互动回应某个帖子，它提供了三种方式，即“回复Reply”该帖子，“喜欢Like”它或者“标记Flag”它并让版主审阅。



回帖体验也很好，编辑器上方会显示实时预览。它还提供了保存回复至草稿、最小化编辑器、全屏编辑以及关闭编辑器等选项。



最后，我查看了用户设置，它完整地包括了通常的设置，并对通知提供了精细的控制。它还展示了与我的 Flarum 账户关联的第三方账户。



总的来说，Flarum 与广受欢迎的 Discourse 提供了相似的舒适体验，它具有有益的特性差异，且其技术栈易于安装和管理。

Flarum 经常更新，自从发布以来，已经取得了长足的发展。它也是 Linux 服务器上最好的 开源论坛软件 之一，事实已经证明了这一点。

推荐阅读 📖

📥 获取 Flarum

你既可以选择遵循 官方文档 中所述的指南自托管 Flarum，也可以选择使用 Free Flarum，这是一项与 Flarum 团队无关的免费社区服务。

目前，他们并未提供任何付费托管方案。

你同样可以通过访问其 GitHub 仓库 来查阅源代码。

💬 你对于 Flarum 有什么看法？你会试一试吗？

The question which arises is how and if it effects the ASLR (https://medium.com/@boutnaru/security-aslr-address-space-layout-randomization-part-1-overview-3aec7fec01e0) posture of the process executing the statically linked binary?
 Thus, as we can see in the screenshot below when linking the binary statically (using “-static”) any time we execute it the addresses of the stack/heap/vdso/vvar memory regions are randomized. However, the memory regions mapped from the binary are not randomized.
 In order to fix this we can use “-static-pie” which can load the memory regions mapped for the statically linked binary to randomized addresses without the need of the dynamic linker (https://patchwork.ozlabs.org/project/gcc/patch/20170808221841.GA16793@gmail.com/#1758721). We can see that in the screenshot below.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello I'm trying to understand how the Linux NAPI works. Here is a description of what i have gathered from the internet:
 Linux NAPI combines interrupts and polling. The network interfaces generate an interrupt when the first packet arrives and register themselves in a work list. All subsequent interrupts are blocked by the interface. Each interface has a DMA ring into which packets are copied by the network driver. When a DMA ring is full, all further incoming packets are dropped. Later on, a software interrupt request is activated, and the devices in the work list are polled. After a certain number of polled packets (quota), the device is placed back at the end of the work list if it still has more packets to process. Otherwise, it is removed from the work list and allowed to generate an interrupt again.
 Is this correct? Would you add something?

 I'm planning to develop an application for Linux desktop as the first product. I have a few ideas, but I'm looking for the path of least resistance just to have a first product and I'll branch out from there. I have some code written for a parental control suite, but that's still months from beta testing. I could continue working on that, and I will at some point, but I'd like to get something out at least by the end of the year. What do you think I should develop first?

RSSfeedASAP is this app and I decided to release it in case someone else finds any use in it.

IBM 于 2006 年底停止了对 OS/2 的支持，但许多公司和个人仍在使用 OS/2 及其衍生系统 eComStation。2014 年 7 月，当时几位曾参与 eComStation 项目的开发人员推出 ArcaOS。经过多年的开发，ArcaOS 发布了最新版本 5.1.0。它兼容 UEFI，可在现代 x86 硬件上运行，还能安装到基于 GPT 的磁盘布局中。需要说明的是，ArcaOS 是付费软件，个人许可证为 139 美元。


消息来源：Arca Noae



老王点评：没想到，已经停止支持十多年的 OS/2 居然还有人坚持使用它的衍生版。

加勒比海上的英属小岛安圭拉今年可能会凭借其 .ai 域名带来高达 3000 万美元的收入。这听起来并不算多，但安圭拉的土地总面积只有 35 平方英里，人口只有 1.5 万人，这占到了其国内生产总值的 10%。1985 年，各国首次获得了自己国家代码顶级域名。1995 年以来，安圭拉分配到了 .ai 域名，安圭拉在 2021 年从 .ai 域名注册中仅获得了 740 万美元的收入。

老王点评：这对于这个小岛真是飞来横财啊，感谢 ChatGPT，感谢 OpenAI。😉




由于 2038 年问题，Debian 放弃 32 位 MIPS 小端架构

Debian 12 是最后一个支持 MIPS 小端架构（MIPSEL）的版本。MIPSEL 现已从 Debian 不稳定版/实验版中移除。MIPSEL 曾是 Debian 中最古老的架构之一，仅次于 i386 和 AMD64。Debian 放弃 MIPSEL 架构的理由是，其 “2038 年问题” 尚未解决、2G 用户空间内存限制，以及 Debian 开发人员缺乏维护该架构的人力。因此，MIPSEL 将从 Debian 官方发布的架构中删除，而 MIPS64EL 作为 64 位小端变体将继续保留。

老王点评：看来 2038 问题真不是个问题，根本等不到 2038 年，有的架构就被淘汰了。]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[法国插画家古斯塔夫·多雷所绘《穿靴子的猫》

1931年3月5日的《申报》刊登了时任湖南省政府主席何键撰写的一篇《咨请教部改良学校课程》，文中气势汹汹地斥责道，“近日课本，每每‘狗说’‘猪说’‘鸭子说’，以及‘猫小姐’‘狗大哥’‘牛公公’之词，充溢行间，禽兽能作人言，尊称加诸兽类，鄙俚怪诞，莫可言状”，随即忧心忡忡地慨叹，“倘再过数十年，人之将亡，滔滔皆可率兽食人，人将相食”，“窃虑其必有无量无边之浩劫也”。他由此强烈建议，这样的课本“不切日用，切宜焚毁”，决不能予以宽宥纵容。没过多久，曾赴美攻读心理学和教育学，回国后在中央大学任教的尚仲衣，出席中华儿童教育社第二届年会并发表演讲。在稍后披露的演讲稿《选择儿童读物的标准》（载《儿童教育》第三卷第八期，1931年）中，他强调在编写和选择儿童读物时应该尽量恪守“合乎事实不违反自然现象”的原则，“鸟兽本不能作人言，如读物中使鸟兽作人言，即是越乎自然”，还举出“儿童在读物中看到猫会讲人话”等作为例证，认为如果出现类似的情况，“未始不是教育中的倒行逆施”。何、尚二人所言桴鼓相应，尽管都没有指名道姓，却很容易令人联想到此前流行的一篇汉译童话中的主人公——穿靴子的猫。

何键《咨请教部改良学校课程》

一、从翻译到改编
有关“穿靴子的猫”的民间故事在欧洲各地流传极广，还相继衍生出各种不同形式的文艺作品：德国剧作家路德维希·蒂克（Ludwig Tieck）以此为题材创作过一部三幕童话剧，德国语言学家格林兄弟（Brüder Grimm）编纂的《儿童与家庭故事集》初版第一卷中也收录过这个故事，最脍炙人口的则莫过于法国作家夏尔·佩罗（Charles Perrault）在编撰《鹅妈妈的故事》时所整理改编的版本——英国民俗学家安德鲁·朗格（Andrew Lang）蒐求遴选世界各地的传说和故事，汇辑为《朗格童话》，就将这个佩罗版童话稍加润饰收入其中。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[陈忠平（章静 绘）

现任教于加拿大维多利亚大学的陈忠平教授曾在南京大学取得学士、硕士学位，于上世纪九十年代赴美留学获得博士学位。在美留学期间，他将研究视角从明清江南市镇转向中国近代商会，2011年斯坦福大学出版社出版了在其博士论文基础上形成的专著——Modern China's Network Revolution: Chambers of Commerce and Sociopolitical Change in the Early Twentieth Century，近期江苏人民出版社推出了此书的中译本《商会与近代中国的社团网络革命》。近期，陈忠平在接受《上海书评》采访时谈了清末商会的起源，以及商会这一“革命性”组织在中国近代史上的历史意义。

《商会与近代中国的社团网络革命》

中国历史学家对近代商会、商团的研究似乎是从1980年代初开始的，这与那时国家对经济的控制比之前大幅度放松有关。具体到个人，我知道您的博士论文就是围绕商人、商会展开的，您是什么时候对商人这一群体产生兴趣的？
陈忠平：我很早就对商人研究感兴趣，我是南京大学历史系1977届的本科生、1982-1984年间的硕士生，当时的研究方向是明清经济史，就涉及商人。只是国内的明清经济史研究的时段到鸦片战争为止，而不到清末，所以我在国内基本上研究的就是鸦片战争以前的江南地区的社会经济史，也包括商人，写过一些商人的文章，比如徽商，还有广东、福建商人的活动。
这本书跟我在国内做的研究有很大不同：第一，它不是国内学者所研究的明清经济史，它在国内史学界属于近代史；第二，国内的历史学界主要是做实证研究，就是搜集、研究原始资料，而这本书很大程度上关注的是一个理论问题，就是在近代中国商会怎么形成网络，又怎么带动其他社团网络发展，造成了一种革命性的变化。这涉及了整个中国。
中国史学传统与西方史学研究之间有一个很大区别，这也是我…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[考虑到它已经如此之老，它的活力令人惊讶。




USENET 管理委员会已经重新召开，这个早于万维网的原创社交网络上出现了增长的新苗头。

USENET（或 NetNews）是一个纯文本的社交讨论平台，或者说，是一系列的被称为“新闻组newsgroup”的讨论组，这些讨论组部署在遍布世界各地的服务器上。虽然其原始开发者在 2010 年 关闭 了他们的服务器，但那只是几百个服务器中的一个，在全球范围内，还有许多服务器运行得很好。USENET 并没有消失，它仍然活着，你可以免费加入，而且大多数操作系统都有协助你使用它的各种客户端应用程序。

尽管 USENET 是去中心化的 P2P 网络，但 Big-8 理事会仍是其最接近中央的管理机构。理事会成员 Tristan Miller 说：“我和 Jason Evans 在 2020 年 重建 了这个理事会，此后，Rayner Lucas 几个月后加入了我们。”

包括其他事项在内，理事会开始重新管理新闻组列表。他们应版主的要求删除了一些过时的群组，并添加了多年来的首个新新闻组，这是一个用于 Gemini 协议 的新闻组。如果你有新闻客户端，你应该可以打开 news:comp.infosystems.gemini。此外，理事会也对网站进行了全新改版，举办了 Reddit AMA（在线问我任何事）活动，更新了版主所用的 GNU Stump 和 WebStump 软件包等。

USENET 比万维网更早，并且它运行的方式更类似与电子邮件：服务器会保存一份新闻组列表，并与其他服务器同步信息。

（USENET 之所以走向衰败，其原因之一是人们发现了如何发布二进制文件的方式 —— 将其编码为多段的 ASCII 文本。它仍然存在 盗版问题，但你可以选择忽略。这也是互联网历史上 首次出现垃圾信息 的地方。）

连上 USENET 其实非常简单。你只需在 USENET 服务器上创建一个账户，安装一个客户端并告知它服务器地址。下载群组列表，选择订阅一些群组，新的消息便会传递到你的客户端，就这么简单。

The Register 的 FOSS 部门使用的是一个名为 “Eternal September” 的服务器，该名字源自当年 AOL 向其互联网客户端引入 USENET 访问功能，导致大量的网络新手涌入但不了解其规则的 事件。这里我们可以给出一条建议：请严格遵循 纯文本、底部回复 的电子邮件“网络礼仪”。

“Eternal September” 只有文本新闻组，不接受二进制文件，但它提供完全免费的账户。而另一些大容量的服务器如 Eweka、Giganews 等则会收取访问费。

至于客户端 —— 如我们在新的 Thunderbird ESR 版本的介绍中所提到的，我们选用了 Thunderbird。它是免费的，易用，并能运行在所有主流的桌面操作系统上。当然，市面上还有许多其他的客户端可供选择。甚至 谷歌的网上论坛 都还在运营，尽管显得有些被忽视。

作为一位重度科幻读者，我乐于深入研究 rec.arts.sf.written 和 rec.arts.sf.fandom 等群组。计算机历史群组 alt.folklore.computers 依然活跃。在一些复古计算频道中依然充满生机，我们也在这些频道中愉快地讨论了 Acorn RISC OS 和 Fortran 等诸多主题。

 This post was prompted by seeing the discussion around the accent color issue, particularly the contentious point named color (AKA limiting accent colors to a set of hand picked, thoroughly tested colors) vs arbitrary colors (AKA allowing the user to choose any color, even if things become unreadable). It culminated for me with this video about it by Brodie.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[对于某些需求，你可能需要找到映射到逻辑单元号（LUN）和文件系统（FS）的块设备，以进行文件系统扩展或灾难恢复（DR）活动。

当你管理更大的基础设施时，类似的活动可能会经常发生。假设有超过 1000 台服务器托管各种应用。

参考以下类似文章：


如何在 Linux 中查找 SAN 磁盘 LUN

如何在 Linux 中将 ASM 磁盘映射到物理磁盘


在本文中，我们将向你展示如何在 Linux 中映射物理磁盘、存储 LUN 和文件系统（FS）。

将物理磁盘映射到 Linux 中的存储 LUN 和文件系统的 Shell 脚本

这个小 shell 脚本可帮助你识别哪些 SAN 磁盘映射到 Linux 上的哪些块设备和文件系统。

vi block_device_mapping_with_LUN_FS.sh


#!/bin/bash
for lunmap in `lsblk | grep disk | grep ^s | awk '{print $1}'`
do
for mpoint in `lsblk /dev/$lunmpa | grep lvm | awk '{print $NF}'`
do
echo "$lunmap --> $mpoint --> $(smartctl -a /dev/$lunmap | grep "Logical Unit id" | awk -F":" '{print $2}')"
done
done


设置 block_device_mapping_with_LUN_FS.sh 文件的可执行权限。

chmod +x block_device_mapping_with_LUN_FS.sh


最后运行脚本查看结果。

sh block_device_mapping_with_LUN_FS.sh




注意： 在上面的输出中，设备 sda 不会显示任何 LUN 信息，因为它是从 VMWare 端添加的虚拟磁盘，没有任何 LUN。其他 3 个磁盘是从存储映射的，这就是我们能够看到 LUN 信息的原因。

如果你想即时运行该脚本，请使用下面的一行脚本。

for lunmap in `lsblk | grep disk | grep ^s | awk '{print $1}'`; do 
    for mpoint in `lsblk /dev/$lunmpa | grep lvm | awk '{print $NF}'`; do 
        echo "$lunmap --> $mpoint --> $(smartctl -a /dev/$lunmap | grep "Logical Unit id" | awk -F":" '{print $2}')"
    done
done


sda --> /
sda --> /usr
sda --> /opt
sda --> /tmp
sda --> /var
sda --> /home
sdb --> /data -->      0x3600d0230000000000e1140463955737c
sdc --> /app -->      0x3600d0230000000000e114046395577cd
sdd --> /backup -->      0x3600d0230000000000e11404639558cc5


总结

在本教程中，我们向你展示了如何在 Linux 上检查 SAN 提供的 LUN 以及底层操作系统磁盘和关联的文件系统。

如果你有任何问题或反馈，请随时在下面发表评论。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This is a side project I've been working on for the last few months. I built an automated system to continuously mirror all the code on PyPI to a series of Github repositories. Mirroring PyPI code to Github enables:
1. Scanning of all new Python packages for accidentally published credentials
2. A browsable/searchable index of published code with a nice UI
3. Large-scale analysis of all published code to see how the language is evolving
Using this project anyone is able to download the contents of PyPI to their personal machine and analyse every piece of code ever published in a matter of hours.
I hope it enables people to do things with the worlds largest and oldest corpus of Python code that wasn't possible before, and while this is likely totally useless to most people I think that is kind of cool and unique.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[XRss is a simple RSS reader web app built to showcase xtemplate, a new web development tool based on Go's html/template and Caddy server.
The entire site UI for XRss comes from a single HTML template file. This index.html includes everything from SQL queries and route definitions and handlers to htmx state transition attributes and tailwindcss classes, and developing it requires zero build steps (amortized).
Check out the source which manages to be at once banal and gnarly: https://github.com/infogulch/xrss/blob/master/templates/inde...
xtemplate preloads the whole template structure into memory and builds the router at startup, so responses to matching requests are rendered after a single lookup. Combined with direct queries to sqlite makes for a very snappy experience typically responding in less than 5ms. (Fingers crossed.)
There are various places where XRss could be improved (PRs welcome!), but it already delivers on its purpose of demonstrating the plausibility of xtemplate. See the xtemplate readme for an overview of what you can do with it. I think of it as 'PHP but the syntax looks like Go templates'.
https://github.com/infogulch/caddy-xtemplate
Let me know what you think! Does remaking PHP from scratch out of Go templates make me a lunatic? (yes) Is it a good idea anyway? (yes) What kind of web application do you think would be a good fit for a platform like this?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[这是终端用户需要知道的所有关于虚拟机的信息，包括它的工作方式及其必要性。


虚拟机（VM）是一个模拟版的物理计算机，它在虚拟环境中模拟各种功能并分配资源。

简言之，你可以在你当前的操作系统中运行另一个操作系统，就像运行媒体播放器或网络浏览器一样。



你可以在 VM 中执行与裸机（例如你的笔记本电脑或个人电脑）相同的操作，例如连接到网络、下载软件、更新操作系统等等。

当然，根据使用场景，VM 的体验可能会与实体计算机有所不同。

让我们来探索虚拟机，它们的应用场景，以及它们的工作原理。

虚拟机：起源



虚拟机是最重要的基于软件的创新之一。它的起源可以追溯到 1966 年的 IBM CP-40 和 CP-67 虚拟机操作系统，那时候人们在研究和测试虚拟内存和资源的概念。

快进到我们发表此文的 2023 年，虚拟机已经无处不在，涵盖从个人电脑，到大型企业，再到小型企业。每个人以某种或其他方式都在使用虚拟机。

考虑到所有这些，显然，虚拟机非常有用。但是，它是如何工作的，我们具体用它来做什么？


💡


裸机 = 实体的物理电脑，例如你的 PC 或笔记本电脑

宿主操作系统 = 安装在你实体电脑上的操作系统

客户操作系统 = 在虚拟机内运行的操作系统

虚拟机（VM）= 是虚拟化应用的通用术语



虚拟机如何运作



理解虚拟化的概念会有助于你弄清楚虚拟机是如何运作的。

回顾我们在一篇文章中的描述：


“虚拟化为你提供了计算机硬件的抽象概念，以便你创建虚拟机（VM）、网络、存储等。”


虚拟化允许用户在虚拟环境中利用物理系统的资源。这使得一个进程可以单独地使用资源，而不会影响物理计算机。

而虚拟机就是运用这一能力的过程，在此你会得到以虚拟磁盘、内存，及其他配置文件形式的虚拟资源，让你能在…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[1/7 的 Linux 内核代码是 AMD GPU 驱动代码

随着开发中的 Linux 6.6 内核增加了对更多即将推出的 Radeon 图形处理器的支持，现在内核中 AMD GPU 驱动代码的行数已超过 500 万行。其中很大一部分是 AMD 在每一代新版本中不断引入的新的自动生成的头文件，这些冗长的头文件就像是 AMD 为其 GPU 创建详尽的公共文档一样。与此同时，整个 Linux 内核源代码树现在大约有 3480 万行，这包括文档、各种树内实用程序/工具、其他辅助工具等。作为对比，英伟达的开源 Nouveau 驱动程序仅有大约 20 万行。


消息来源：Phoronix



老王点评：相比 Linus 曾经对英伟达的愤怒，AMD 倒是大量往内核提交代码，可是这样往内核中“灌水”真的好吗？




ReiserFS 被正式标记为“过时”

ReiserFS 曾是二十多年前 Linux 引入的第一个日志文件系统，在 2006 年前 SUSE Linux 发行版一直将其作为默认文件系统。但自从 ReiserFS 作者 Hans Reiser 因谋杀罪被判刑之后，该文件系统的开发就几乎停滞了。内核开发者去年开始讨论 废弃 ReiserFS 文件系统，并在 Linux 5.18 中将其标记为废弃，openSUSE 也结束了对 ReiserFS 的支持。在 Linux 6.6 中，ReiserFS 不再被标记为“支持”，而是被正式标记为“过时”，将在未来几年来从主线内核中移除。


消息来源：Phoronix



老王点评：很可惜，但更令人遗憾的是，在主要开发者入狱后，因为没有人和公司愿意继续参与一个有污点的人开创的项目，而导致项目消亡。




Visual Studio for Mac：从开源到闭源，到废弃

微软正在停止 Visual Studio for Mac（VS Mac）的开发，将于 2024 年结束支持。VS Mac 是作为 Windows 版 Visual Studio 的 Mac 版本推出的，但该产品的起源不同，其功能也从未接近 Windows 版的同类产品。它主要是一个 .NET 集成开发环境，不支持 C/C++。它始于 2000 年 SharpDevelop，它是一个 C# 的开源集成开发环境。然后它分叉成为 Linux 上的 MonoDevelop，并被 Xamarin 接管成为 Xamarin Studio，在 2016 年随同 Xamarin 被微软收购。微软将其重新命名为 Visual Studio for Mac，并关闭了源代码。随后几年，直到被废弃前，它的开发几乎停滞不前。幸运的是，MonoDevelop 还有一个开源的复刻 DotDevelop 正在持续开发当中。


消息来源：Dev Class



老王点评：微软发现 VS Code 更好时，这种边缘项目自然就废弃了。不知道会不会有一天微软将 Visual Studio 也废弃了，只保留下 VS Code 呢？]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[对于不想在桌面上看到主文件夹图标的 Ubuntu 用户，这里有一个简单技巧。


Ubuntu 使用定制的 GNOME 版本，由于侧边启动器，它的外观与旧的 Unity 桌面有些相似。

普通 GNOME 和 Ubuntu 的 GNOME 之间的另一个区别是桌面上主文件夹和回收站的使用。这些图标就在那里，以便你可以快速访问它们。



如果你觉得不美观，可以从桌面视图中删除主文件夹。

让我分享一下 GUI 和命令行方法。

在 Ubuntu 中隐藏桌面上的主文件夹图标

你只需要这样做：

在 Ubuntu 中按 Super + D 键盘快捷键访问桌面。

现在右键单击桌面上的空白区域。

从右键单击上下文菜单中，选择桌面图标设置Desktop Icons Settings。



它将在“设置Settings”应用中打开 Ubuntu 桌面Ubuntu Desktop设置选项。你也可以通过打开“设置”应用并转到侧边栏中的“Ubuntu 桌面”选项来访问它。

在这里，你将看到**显示个人文件夹Show Personal folder的切换选项**。将其关闭以禁用桌面上的主文件夹图标。




💡 想要恢复主文件夹图标吗？ 再次切换它。


使用命令行禁用主文件夹图标

是的，你可以从命令行完全禁用主文件夹图标。

打开终端并使用以下命令。

gsettings set org.gnome.shell.extensions.ding show-home false


效果将是立竿见影的。

要恢复图标，请使用相同的命令，但使用 true 而不是 false：

gsettings set org.gnome.shell.extensions.ding show-home true


看到那有多简单了吗？ 也可以采取类似的步骤来删除回收站图标。


如何在 Ubuntu 中移走桌面的回收站图标

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[子曰：“唯女子与小人为难养也，近之则不孙，远之则怨。”（《论语·阳货·第十七》）这句话里的“女子”和“小人”到底是什么意思？该如何翻译成英语？
朱熹《四书章句集注》解释说：此小人，亦谓仆隶下人也。君子之于臣妾，庄以莅之，慈以蓄之，则无二者之患矣。显然，朱熹是把“女子”解释为妾侍，把“小人”解释为仆隶下人的。
吕思勉先生的《读史札记》第一九八条对“女子”和“小人”做了同样的解释：此所谓女子，乃指女子中之小人言，非谓凡女子也。小人犹言臣，女子犹言妾耳，古臣妾恒并称。吕先生随后分别举了《礼记》《战国策》《国语》中的例子来说明“臣妾并举”乃是古代的普遍现象。照此解释，“女子”似应译为concubine；而“小人”则是servant。
钱穆先生《论语新解》的解释是：此章女子小人指家中仆妾而言。妾视仆尤近，故女子在小人前。因其指仆妾，故称养。待之近，则狎而不逊。远，则怨恨必作。善御仆妾，亦齐家之一事。钱穆先生的“白话试译”是：先生说：“只有家里的妾侍和仆人最难养。你若和他们近了，他将不知有逊让。你若和他们远了，他便会怨恨你。”钱穆先生的解释和上述朱熹和吕思勉的解释几乎完全相同。
杨伯峻先生《论语译注》的译文是：孔子道：“只有女子和小人是难得同他们共处的，亲近了，他会无礼；疏远了，他会怨恨。”杨先生此书流传极广，可惜对两者没有作进一步解释。
李泽厚先生《论语今读》里，“译”：孔子说：“只有妇女和小人难以对付：亲近了，不谦逊；疏远了，又埋怨。”“注”：《朱注》：此小人，亦谓仆隶下人也。“记”：这章最为现代妇女所诟病。好些人写文章来批评，好些人写文章来辩说，其实都不必要。相反，我以为这句话相当准确地描述了妇女性格的某些特征。对她们亲密，她们有时就过分随便，任意笑骂打闹。而稍一疏远，便埋怨不已。这种心理性格特征本身并无所谓好坏，只是由性别差异产生的不同而已；应说它是心理学的某种事实，并不必含褒…]]></summary>

在韩国出生的德国新生代思想家韩炳哲（Byung-Chul Han）被西班牙《国家报》（El País）誉为“德国哲学界的一颗新星”，他的作品被译成十几种语言，据称中译本韩炳哲作品第一辑共九种（中信出版集团，2019年）出版后在中国读者中也产生了较大反响。应该肯定的是，韩炳哲的哲学思考与写作文本贴近数字媒体时代的现实前沿，将哲学的人文传统和批判传统相结合，针对当下世界的精神状况展开论述，因此被称为“互联网时代的精神分析师”“大数据时代的哲学批判指南”。他的很多作品篇幅简短，思想锋利，文字简洁明快，这些特点也使他在网络时代容易受到读者的追捧。在读过他的几本小书之后，我有点担心的是他那些不乏思想性和洞察力的论述会被他一再批判的讨喜点赞型社会点赞成网络心灵鸡汤。但是无论如何，在他作品中一再体现出来的批判性是不会因此而变质的。
韩炳哲的《妥协社会：今日之痛》（原书名Palliativgesellschaft： Schmerz heute）的核心主题是“痛苦”，全书十一章中有八章的题目就是：痛苦恐惧症、痛苦之无意义、痛苦之狡计、痛苦之为真理、痛苦之诗学、痛苦之辩证法、痛苦之存在论、痛苦之伦理学，就连在第二章的题目“幸福强制”之下的第一句话也是“痛苦是一种综合的文化现象，它在社会中的出现和意义也与统治形式息息相关”（第9页）。
那么，究竟作者为什么要如此重视“痛苦”？这是一种无病呻吟吗？关键的问题是看作者从什么角度和如何谈论“痛苦”。全书的第一句话引用了德国著名心理学家、哲学家恩斯特·云格尔的“告诉我你和痛苦的关系，我就会说出你是谁！”，然后他马上就说“这句话完全适用于整个社会。我们与痛苦的关系透露出我们生活在一个怎样的社会。痛苦即密码，它藏有解读当时社会的关键信息。因此，所有社会…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[《郑文焯年谱长编》，杨传庆著，中华书局2023年5月出版，371页，148.00元

1922年，梁启超在清华大学文学社的活动中进行了题为《中国韵文里头所表现的情感》的讲演，指出“清代大词家固然很多，但头两把交椅，却被前后两位旗人——成容若、郑叔问占去”。他提到的“郑叔问”，就是四年前离世的友人、“晚清四大词人”之一的郑文焯。时至今日，距离梁启超的评论已过去了一百年，较之纳兰性德在词学研究界已有多部词集注本问世（赵秀亭《饮水词校笺》、张草纫《纳兰词笺注》、张秉戍《纳兰词笺注》等），其作品风靡大江南北，被普通读者记诵的程度甚至超过了《花间》等经典，郑文焯在当代的知名度就小得多，缺少像朱祖谋编《宋词三百首》、况周颐著《蕙风词话》那样的“出圈”之作。其词集《樵风乐府》至今尚无校注本，其年谱的编纂工作亦长期无人问津，殊为遗憾。
事实上，在“晚清四大词人”中，朱祖谋、况周颐、王鹏运三人在近年皆有较完整的年谱问世，分别为沈文泉的《朱彊村年谱》（浙江古籍出版社，2013年），郑炜明、陈玉莹的《况周颐年谱》（齐鲁书社，2015年），李保阳的《王鹏运年谱稿》（见氏著《王鹏运词学文献考》，华艺数位股份有限公司，2022年），唯郑文焯的年谱迟迟未有动静。虽然早在九十年前，就有大鹤之婿戴正诚的《郑叔问先生年谱》（《青鹤》杂志，1933年）可资参考，但毕竟年代久远，当时的编纂理念和文献信息，已无法满足二十一世纪的学术需求。南开大学杨传庆先生研究大鹤十数年，早前已出版其博士学位论文《郑文焯词及词学研究》（南开大学出版社，2013年），最近又由中华书局出版所著《郑文焯年谱长编》（以下简称《长编》），洵为大鹤功臣。此书作为当代“晚清四大词人”年谱的收官之作，不仅填补了相关研究领域的空白，还是学界以“长编”体例编纂清代词人年谱的又一次尝试（此前唯有陆有富《文廷式年谱长编》，中华书局，2020年）。在史料考辨…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[这里列出了在 GNOME 45 中你可以期待的新特性和改进。


每次 GNOME 的主要版本更新对我来说都充满了激动。

你可以始终期待看到 以 UI 为中心的变化、功能增强，以及核心应用的更新。

GNOME 44 引入了一些有趣的新功能，比如能够检查正在后台运行的应用、在文件选择器中的缩略图视图等等。

GNOME 45 计划于 9 月 20 日 发布，但你已经可以在其 beta 版本中预览到更新的功能集。现在，让我们一起看看在 GNOME 45 中有哪些你可以期待的新内容。

GNOME 45：有哪些新变化？



主要的亮点包括：


新的核心应用

系统设置中的新隐私中心

系统设置中新的“关于About”面板

日历应用的新图标

对 Nautilus 文件管理器 UI 的微调


我将对所有这些改变进行分类，以帮助你更好的理解。那么，让我们立即开始：

Nautilus 的改善



在过去，Nautilus 文件管理器没有进行过任何 UI 调整。但是，在 GNOME 45 中，它做了一些微妙的 UI 改版，在侧边栏中你可以看到汉堡菜单。

总的来说，左侧边栏和窗口的其他部分更具区分度。

你还可以期待其性能提升和搜索功能的改善。

系统设置的变更

自 GNOME 43 和 44 版本起，GNOME 在努力改进并清理系统设置Settings，以便在简化系统设置选项的访问性的同时，简化所有的可用选项。

在这里，“隐私Privacy”菜单已经改版，选项的展示更加有条理且易于访问。



接下来，“关于About”区域也进行了调整，以便通过“系统详细信息System Details”菜单展示技术信息，如下图所示。



你需要点击“系统详细信息”来获取关于操作系统和硬件的所有必要技术信息。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[One of the first things I do after installing a Linux distribution, is add to the default /etc/profile (or create and entry in /etc/profile.d/) that exports variables such as XDG[DATA,CONFIG]_DIRS, and XDG[DATA,CONFIG,CACHE,STATE]_HOME to their respective locations, based on the freedesktop.org 'basedir' specification (as outlined here: https://specifications.freedesktop.org/basedir-spec/latest/ar01s03.html).
 I do this, because after trying many different distributions, I noticed that the output of printenv did not contain these variables.
 As a user, these variables make my experience simpler. I'm not going to argue that these specifications should be followed by all, because I know there are many users who are committed to dying on the hill that is their cluttered home directory. However, the existence of these variables is not a deterrent to users who do not want to use the specification, as many applications will want to use your home directory anyway. If the existence of these variables made the specification strictly followed, projects like xdg-ninja (https://github.com/b3nj5m1n/xdg-ninja) would have no reason to exist.
 I have seen many... questionable things in various distributions' /etc/profile's, but never once have I seen one that simply exported these variables. Why not?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The LFS release includes updates to binutils-2.41, gcc-13.2.0, and glibc-2.38. In total, 38 packages were updated since the last release. The Linux kernel has also been updated to version 6.4.12.
 Other significant changes include:
 - Addition of libxcrypt as a separate package.
 Previously this package was included with glibc.
 - For the sysV version of the book, udev is now extracted directly from the systemd tarball. This change also requires building the Python modules jinja and markupsafe.
 - The new package pkgconf is now used instead of pkg-config because the later packages is no longer maintained.
 - The new Python module flit-core was added as a new required dependency for the wheel module. 
 The BLFS version includes approximately 1000 packages beyond the base Linux From Scratch Version 11.2 book. This release has 1543 updates from the previous BLFS version including package updates and numerous text and formatting changes.
 New in this version of BLFS is the LXQt Desktop Environment and an alternative method of building Qt with lighter dependency requirements than the full Qt package.
 DEPRECATION NOTICE: Future versions of BLFS will remove the unmaintained LXDE Desktop Environment and support for the Reiser file system (reiserfsprogs).

over the last several years to provide a race-free way for processes to

basic pidfd support with the 2.36 release in 2022, it still lacks a
complete solution for race-free process creation.  This

near future, though, with an extension to the posix_spawn()

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[攻击者用廉价无线电设备停止了几十列波兰列车

8 月下旬，波兰全国有超过 20 列客运和货运列车紧急停车。安全专家认为，破坏者只是通过无线电频率向列车发出了连续三个声调的无线电停车指令，就触发了列车的紧急停车功能。事实上，多年来波兰的无线电和列车论坛上一直有人在介绍发送该命令的方法。波兰列车使用的是缺乏保护的 VHF 150 MHz 无线电系统，任何人只需要花费大约 30 美元购买现成的无线电设备，就可以触发列车的紧急停车功能。而波兰计划在 2025 年前取代现有的无线电系统，升级为采用支持加密和身份验证的 GMS 蜂窝无线电系统。


消息来源：Wired



老王点评：真不敢想象这么脆弱的列车系统，相比之下，波士顿地铁那个免票乘车的漏洞简直不是个事。




谷歌从用户私人保存的链接中删除盗版网址

迄今为止，谷歌搜索引擎已经处理了超过 70 亿次版权移除请求。根据《数字千年版权法》（DMCA）的要求，大部分被举报的链接都会从谷歌的搜索索引中清除。但最近，谷歌将这一范围延伸到了用户私人保存在谷歌的链接清单上。有人反映收到了来自谷歌的电子邮件，通知他的一个链接已从他的谷歌收藏中删除，因为该链接违反了谷歌的政策，已被谷歌搜索屏蔽。这并非是谷歌同步的 Chrome 浏览器书签，而是保存在谷歌上的链接，这些链接收藏可以是私人的，也可以与第三方共享。


消息来源：Torrent Freak



老王点评：所以，保存东西最可靠的还是放在自己的云存储上。




美国版权局发出 AI 版权三问

美国版权局开始就人工智能和版权问题公开征求意见，以确定如何处理这一问题。该机构希望公众回答三个主要问题：人工智能模型在训练中应如何使用受版权保护的数据？即使没有人类参与，人工智能生成的材料是否也可以受版权保护？版权责任如何与人工智能结合？


消息来源：The Verge



老王点评：AI 给传统的版权保护带来了新问题，如果社会能就这些主要问题达成原则共识，AI 才能去掉头上所悬挂的达摩克利斯之剑。]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[如果你是在 Linux 或 WSL 环境下进行开发的开发者，以下这个好消息会让你兴奋起来。


JetBrains 平台近日宣布，基于 IntelliJ 的 IDE 最终将实现对 Wayland 显示服务器 协议的支持。可能你并不知道，PyCharm 和 IntelliJ IDEA 就是搭建在 IntelliJ 平台之上的出色 IDE，而由谷歌打造的 Android Studio 也是同样的应用。

Wayland 协议逐步成为 Linux 发行版的默认选择，与 X11 相比，它可以提供更快、更安全和更稳定的体验。如果你使用的编程环境能够支持 Wayland，那么用户体验会得到显著提升。

但是，具体表现在哪些方面有所增强，他们怎么实现这个目标的呢？下文有详细解说。

分数缩放和 WSL 集成

使用 Linux 版本的 IntelliJ IDEA 等 IDE 的用户，终将借助分数缩放，可以在高分辨率显示屏上自定义字体、图标的大小。

无论是多屏幕环境，还是高清显示屏，都可以通过 Wayland 的支持享受到提升的 IDE 体验。

你不再需要担心 IDE 的文本显示模糊的问题。

不仅仅局限于原生的 Linux 环境，同样适用于使用 Windows 的 Linux 子系统（WSL），即那些 “Bash on Windows” 用户。

Wayland 的支持将确保你可以无缝集成 WSL。

此外，作为用户，你还将享受到 Wayland 带来的以下新特性：


弹出式窗口

HiDPI 支持

窗口的交互式缩放


总的说来，通过实现 Wayland 的支持，基于 IntelliJ 的 IDE 将会更具响应速度，实现更高的稳定性和安全性。

构建 Wayland 工具集

让 Java 支持 Wayland 是件颇具挑战性的任务，但 IntelliJ 已经找到了应对之策。

JetBrains 和 Oracle 的桌面团队共同开发出一个基于 OpenJDK 21 的 Wayland 工具集。

由于拥有该工具集，你将获得一系列能力，包括：


基于软件的渲染。

极简的窗口装饰。

弹出窗口，包括应用于顶层菜单的窗口。

提供包括不同每台监视器比例的 HiDPI 和多监视器支持。


此外，他们还计划添加剪贴板拖放支持、基于 Vulkan 的加速渲染，以及使用快捷键在窗口间切换的功能。

你可以通过访问 OpenJDK 维基 来关注 Wayland 工具集的开发进程。

至于 Wayland 支持的具体实现时间并未明确，但可以肯定的是，这项工作正在进行中，而且这也表明 IntelliJ 平台也正在关注以 Linux 为主的用户群。

如需获取更多信息，你可以访问 官方公告 进行查阅。

💬对于 IntelliJ 决定在其 IDE 加入 Wayland 原生支持你有什么看法呢？欢迎在评论区分享你的意见。

《大自然的恋人：玛丽安娜·诺斯的画旅人生》（下文引用此书，只列页码），正文由三部分组成，第一部分是小传，二十页的篇幅，简单、扼要地介绍了玛丽安娜·诺斯（Marianne North，1830-1890）的生平；第二部分，“环球之旅”，是全书的重中之重，约一百三十页，按时间顺序讲述了传主在世界各地的旅行；同时，它还遵循英国皇家植物园（也叫邱园）诺斯画廊展览的六大主题，要言不烦、图文并茂地介绍了上述旅途中的一些重要植物：“经济作物”“极其重要的棕榈类植物”“神奇的果实”“神圣的植物”“药用植物”和“有用的植物”。这两条线索自然而巧妙地交织起来，寓教于乐的目的达到了，想必这也是“青鸟新知”系列的宗旨之一。第三部分“画廊”，介绍了诺斯画廊的历史以及邱园对画廊及画作最新的修缮工作。本书的一大亮点在于，几乎每页正文都配有彩色图片，大多是诺斯本人构思独特、美轮美奂的画作。
环球旅行
传记部分的取材，主要来自玛丽安娜·诺斯的回忆录《幸福生活的回忆》（Recollections of a Happy Life）。所谓“画旅人生”，是名副其实的。抛开早期和父亲结伴旅行不计，1871年至1885年间，诺斯只身四处漫游，不论走到哪儿都不辍画笔。今天邱园画廊展出的八百四十八幅绘画作品，基本都是在这一时期绘制的。她的旅行地包括北美洲、牙买加、巴西、特内里费岛、日本、新加坡、婆罗洲、爪哇、斯里兰卡、印度、澳大利亚、新西兰、南非、塞舌尔和智利等大约十五个国家。

作为一种视觉意识形态（Visual Ideology），人种（Race）与人种主义（Racism）实际上是一种很晚近的现象。正如汉娜福特（Ivan Hannaford）指出的一样，在古代以及中世纪的欧洲，“人种”这一概念不论是在生物学还是社会学意义上都不存在。直到十六世纪，随着生物学知识增加以及西方列强的海外殖民扩张活动，“人种”概念才逐渐形成并开始具备其原始的生物学意义。此后，“人种”经过了近两个世纪的争论，在十八世纪获得了社会学的意义，且在此后欧洲民族国家的建构过程中发挥着重大作用（Race : the history of an idea in the West, Washington: Johns Hopkins University Press, 1996, pp.8, 213-224）。事实上，在非欧洲地区，“人种主义”作为一种综合性的解释体系也获得了特殊地位。例如，沙培德（Peter Zarrow）就指出，“人种”的历史解释对近代中国人的吸引力远远地超过了同样具有普适性价值的基督教教义（Liang Qichao and the Conceptualization of “Race” in Late Qing China， 《“中央”研究院近代史研究所集刊》，第52期，2006年6月，113-164页）。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[通常 Linux 系统会默认引导系统进入最新安装的内核，并保留最新的 3 个 Linux 内核引导条目。

假设你已经执行了 yum update，并且新的内核作为更新的一部分已经安装了。这时，由于这个新内核与应用程序不兼容，它会阻止应用程序启动。

想要暂时解决这个问题，你应该还是引导系统进入旧内核。

在本文中，我们将向您展示如何使用 grubby 工具将旧的内核版本设置为 RHEL 8 和 RHEL 9 系统上的默认版本。

grubby 是什么

grubby 是一个命令行工具，用于在多个架构上更新和显示引导加载配置文件的信息。

检查当前引导的内核

你可以使用如下的 uname 命令来检查当前引导/加载的内核。

# uname -r
4.18.0-477.13.1.el8_8.x86_64


列出默认内核

使用 grubby 验证默认内核版本，运行以下命令：

# grubby --default-kernel
/boot/vmlinuz-4.18.0-477.13.1.el8_8.x86_64


要获取当前默认内核的索引号，请运行以下命令：

# grubby --default-index
0


检查已安装的内核

要检查已安装的内核的列表，请运行以下命令：

我们来解释以下的输出信息。最新安装的内核的条目索引为 0，接下来的 较旧的内核 版本将会是 1，第二个更旧的内核版本将会是 2，而 救援内核 的条目索引将会是 3。

# grubby --info=ALL | egrep -i 'index|title'
index=0

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[这是运行在 AWS Firecracker 上的，当然，同时也有其他的新兴微虚拟机（microVM）引擎可供选择。




在更换了 FreeBSD 内核中的排序算法后，其启动速度提高了 100 倍以上……虽然这是专门针对 微虚拟机microVM 的优化，但所有人都应能从中受益。

过去五年，微虚拟机在科技研发领域中备受关注。其核心理念是重新包装和创新了 IBM 在 1960 年代随着 虚拟机管理程序hypervisor 诞生所发明的 一些概念和技术：设计专门作为另一个操作系统上的访客系统运行的操作系统。这意味着该操作系统必须专门构建在虚拟机内执行，并与特定的管理程序提供的资源进行交互，而不是模拟硬件。

这就意味着访客操作系统几乎不需要针对真实硬件的支持，只需要 VirtIO 驱动，它们可以直接和宿主机的管理程序提供的功能进行交互。反过来说，管理程序无需提供模拟的 PCI 总线、模拟的电源管理、模拟的显卡、模拟的网卡等等。结果就是，管理程序本身可以变得更加微型和简化。

通过无情地缩减虚拟机监视器和运行在其内部的操作系统，这让两端都能更小、更简洁。意味着虚拟机能更少的使用资源，并能更快速地启动。

目前，这个商业目标是提供 “无服务器serverless” 的计算能力。实际上，“无服务器” 是一种市场双关语：当然，真实世界中的服务器仍存在于某个数据中心中。但这与提供“基础设施即服务（IaaS）”模型不同，而是提供“函数即服务（FaaS）”的模式。这就代表着你不需要了解任何有关基础设施的知识 —— 你的程序直接调用另一个程序，然后管理工具会运行所需的特定操作，返回结果，然后删除用于执行计算的虚拟机。你根本不需要知道这过程在何处，如何进行。

对消费者来说，这种技术的优势在于其快速和易用性。而对服务提供商而言，因为能够更快地回收和再利用资源，使得相同的硬件能服…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[SELinux 移除了 NSA 的名字

二十年来，安全增强型 Linux（SELinux）一直是主线内核的一部分，它提供了一个实施访问控制安全策略的安全模块，现在已被广泛用于增强生产型 Linux 服务器和其他系统的安全性。SELinux 最初是美国国家安全局（NSA）开发并贡献给 Linux 内核的，并且多年来一直参与贡献，因此其正式的名称是 “NSA SELinux”。但鉴于 NSA 不良的信誉，它一直被怀疑在 SELinux 代码中埋有不为人知的后门，虽然并没有公开的证据可以证明这一点。由于社区的质疑，以及 SELinux 越来越多的由社区参与开发，Linux 内核将从 6.6 开始，NSA SELinux 的名称中将不再包含 “NSA”。


消息来源：Phoronix



老王点评：虽然我对 NSA 也持不信任的态度，但是我对这一做法不以为然。




OpenAI 称以变革的方式使用受版权保护的材料并不违反版权

OpenAI 针对作者们提起的一系列诉讼做出了回应，这些诉讼指控 OpenAI 非法使用他们的作品未经许可的副本训练了 ChatGPT。OpenAI 请求法院驳回除一项直接著作权侵权外的所有指控。OpenAI 称作者们 “误解了版权的范围，没有考虑到限制和例外情况（包括合理使用）”。OpenAI 认为，即使 ChatGPT 庞大数据集中的 “极小一部分” 包含了作者们的书籍，但 “创新者以变革的方式使用受版权保护的材料并不违反版权”。OpenAI 辩称，与试图通过传播版权材料直接获利的剽窃者不同，他们的目标是 “教会其模型推导出人类语言的基本规则”，并提醒法庭注意：“虽然作者可以为其图书注册版权，但该图书中与‘词频、句法模式和主题标记’相关的‘统计信息’却不在版权保护范围之内”。


消息来源：Ars Technica



老王点评：从一定意义上，这些诉讼反映了当前 AI 技术发展与版权法之间的矛盾，其判决可以视为未来 AI 领域的一个重要法律参考。值得持续关注。




微软使用类似恶意软件的弹窗让人们放弃谷歌

有人反馈，当他使用 Chrome 浏览器时，他的 Windows 11 弹出了一个窗口，要求将 Chrome 浏览器中的默认搜索引擎切换为微软必应。它并不是一个普通的通知，它既没有出现在通知中心，也与 Windows 11 向你推荐新功能的部分无关。它是一个以某种方式出现在临时目录中的可执行文件，并带有微软的数字签名。这种行为让用户感觉像“被安装了恶意软件”一样。微软回应称，他们“已经意识到了这些报告，并暂停了这一通知”。


消息来源：The Verge



老王点评：我本来想说，“已经为微软许可证付费的用户有理由不受这种广告、分析的影响，而开源的操作系统就可以避免这种情况”，但是我想起来 Canonical 也做过类似的事情，所以我无话可说。]]></summary>

十三世纪著名的波斯史家与政治家志费尼（Ata-Malik Juvaini, 1226–1283）在其著作《世界征服者史》（何高济译，内蒙古人民出版社，1980）中提及了一段轶事：有一回窝阔台合罕在猎场时，一个人献给他两三个西瓜。不巧的是，当时他身边的随从身上没有可供施舍的金银或衣服，只有一旁的二皇后木格哈敦（Möge Khatun）耳边佩戴着的两颗如星星般灿烂耀眼的珍珠。合罕便让木格哈敦把那两颗珍珠赏给那人。然而木格哈敦觉得那人不知道珍珠的价值，赏给他等于明珠暗投，于是建议合罕让那人明天到宫帐门前，另给金银锦衣打发即可。然而，合罕此时展现了他的仁慈，表示那人贫无立锥之地，等不到明天。他还预言就算把这些珍珠赏给那人，它们很快也会回到自己的手中。于是木格哈敦便将珍珠赏给了那人，那人高兴地离开了。但那人不知道珍珠的价格之高，便在市集上将珠子以低价卖出了。买主很高兴，认为这么好的珍珠难得，应当献给合罕，于是便来到合罕跟前，将珠子进献给他。合罕高兴地收下了珠子，不仅跟身旁的木格哈敦夸耀自己的预言应验，而且还重重赏赐了献珠者（上册，247页）。
这则轶事巧妙揭示了珍珠在蒙古宫廷中的使用、看法与流通。然而蒙古人作为一个来自内亚草原的民族，他们是如何接触到这种来自海洋的珍稀物品？他们又如何取得与使用这些珍珠？珍珠对于蒙古人而言又有什么功能与象征意义？珍珠与其他类似的奢侈品是如何在蒙古帝国所建立的政经体系中占有一席之地，甚至具有塑造帝国的作用？近期出版的《珍珠在蒙古帝国：草原、海洋与欧亚交流网络》（The Steppe and the Sea: Pearls in the Mongol Empire）就处理了上述问题。

萨曼莎·罗斯·希尔（Samantha Rose Hill）的《我愿你是你所是：汉娜·阿伦特传》（原书名Hannah Arendt，2021）在“序言”中谈到一个问题：“近年来，许多人都开始阅读汉娜·阿伦特的作品，试图去理解我们今天面对的危机。阿伦特的文字中到底有什么，在今天让如此之多的人找到共鸣？为什么我们总要把目光投向她，来理解21世纪的政治状况？”
这的确是首先要思考的重要问题。希尔认为：因为阿伦特可以帮助我们通过一个新角度来看待我们最切近的经验，她关注的她那个年代的问题呈现在每一代人面前都是新的样貌，需要我们的理解。（第8页）另外，更重要的是，“我希望她面对绝境的勇气能够激励我们鼓起勇气，在‘我们这个并不美丽的世界’，去抵抗我们今天面对的黑暗”（11页）。直到全书的最后，希尔仍然在回答这个问题：随着过去几年反自由主义在世界各地的崛起，《极权主义的起源》引发了前所未有的关注，有无数文章写阿伦特对法西斯主义和极权主义的分析。阿伦特的作品帮助我们在当下找到方向、面对新现象，“她作品的核心是，我们必须不断地对世界进行新的思考，定义新的界限，绘制新的格局，寻找新的语言，讲述新的故事。这是她留给我们的遗产”（247-248页）。另外，西蒙·斯威夫特（Simon Swift）在回答“为什么是阿伦特”的时候说：“汉娜·阿伦特是我们急需的批判思想家。在她晚期有关美国政治和文化的许多文章中，阿伦特论及了许多在今天仍与我们相关的问题，比如公民自由的性质、国家支持的暴力问题，以及自‘越战’以来政治中的谎言和犯罪文化。”“我们当前的政治危机乃是我们正在经历的新黑暗时代，全球各地的赤裸生命正以各种日益令人不安又陌生诧异的公开方式遭到残酷对待，面对这些现象，阿伦特仍是我…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[E.T.A.霍夫曼

德国浪漫派代表人物E.T.A.霍夫曼（1776-1822）是一位“多面手”：他不仅是著名小说家、剧作家，也是画家、男高音歌唱家和乐队指挥。照托马斯·曼的看法，霍夫曼堪称十九世纪唯一具有欧洲（世界）声望的德国作家，其作品对后世文学艺术影响深远：舒曼的钢琴套曲《克莱斯勒偶记》直接改编自他的同名小说，瓦格纳的歌剧《纽伦堡名歌手》取材于他的中篇小说集《谢拉皮翁兄弟》，奥芬巴赫（Jacques Offenbach）的轻歌剧《霍夫曼的故事》素材源自他的《沙人》等四部小说，欣德米特（Paul Hindemith）的歌剧《卡地亚克》（Cardillac）取材于他的历史传奇《斯居戴里小姐》。当然，流行最广的是柴科夫斯基的芭蕾舞剧《胡桃夹子》，改编自他脍炙人口的童话《胡桃夹子和鼠王》。至于霍夫曼的文学崇拜者，则包括陀思妥耶夫斯基、安徒生、巴尔扎克、狄更斯以及大洋彼岸的欧文、霍桑和爱伦·坡等一众名人。

霍夫曼生年不满半百，但他的文学成就相当惊人。除了上述作品，他的代表作还有《侏儒查赫斯》《魔鬼的迷魂汤》《雄猫穆尔的生活观》《布兰比拉公主》等，不仅数量众多，而且质量上乘——其构思之精巧，想象之奇崛，即便与现代（乃至后现代）作家相比亦不遑多让。以《布兰比拉公主》为例，波德莱尔认为它是霍夫曼最完美的作品；而海涅则宣称，谁读了本书而不失理智，“谁就没有理智可以失去”。德国文史大家里卡达·胡赫（Richard Huch）在《浪漫派盛衰记》（Ausbreitung und Verfall der Romantik，1902）中盛赞霍夫曼：“通过深入观察心灵的阴暗面，创作了许多源自心灵的奇妙事物。”当代著名作家、诺贝尔文学奖获得者赫尔曼·黑塞（Hermann Hesse）则将“鬼才”霍夫曼的“志怪小说”与中国古代作家进行比较——或据此将这位德国文学史上“仅次于歌德”的二号人物称为“德国…]]></summary>

Linux does have it's hiccups however, like with Windows App compatibility and some are still scared about Linux, but Linux is doing its best to ease newcomers into Linux, and its getting better and better with Windows apps and games.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[最新的 Mageia 主要版本已经推出，赶快来试试看吧。


Mageia 最初是 Mandriva Linux 的一个分支，但现在已经发展成全面的 独立 Linux 发行版。

从 2010 年以来，Mageia 已经成为一个用于桌面或服务器的稳定且安全的操作系统，并且定期更新。

它的近期的发布公告揭示了 Mageia 9 带来的众多核心改进。

下面就让我为你介绍一下这些改进。

🆕 Mageia 9：新亮点是什么？



由最新发布的 Linux 内核 6.4 驱动的 Mageia 9，与前一个版本相比，有了大量的提升。

以下是一些主要的亮点：


改善了内核与硬件的支持

更新了软件套件

升级了桌面环境


改善了内核与硬件的支持

得益于 Linux 内核 6.4，Mageia 9 配备了 Mesa 3D 23.1，这使得图形支持达到了新的高度。

在硬件方面，Mageia 9 使用了针对 AMD/ATI 显卡的自由视频驱动程序，AMDGPU，能同时支持新旧显卡。不过，似乎专有驱动程序不能用于这个版本。

另外，对于英伟达显卡 ，与 Mageia 8 相比，Xorg Nouveau 驱动的表现得到了提升，并且在非自由仓库中还提供了专有的英伟达驱动程序。

因此，Mageia 9 能够同时支持新款和旧款的英伟达 GPU。

还有，Mageia 9 提供了 X.Org 21.1.8 和 XWayland 22.1.9，这些都已从 Xserver 分离出来，以便进行更加方便的维护。

更新的软件套件

Mageia 9 特色之一是它丰富的应用策略，所有这些应用都已经升级至新版本。

包含如下内容：


LibreOffice 7.5

Blender 3.3.4

VirtualBox 7.0.10

NeoVim 0.9.1

Xen 4.17.0

Ruby 3.1.4

QEmu 7.2

RPM 4.18

Vim 9.0

PHP 8.2


桌面环境升级



首先，由于 Mageia 的默认桌面是 KDE Plasma，让我们先从这个开始。

Mageia 9 带有基于 Qt 5.15.7 构建的 KDE Plasma 5.27.5、KDE Frameworks 5.105 和 KDE Applications 23.04.1。

然后，对于 GNOME 版 ，Mageia 9 提供了 GNOME 44.2 ，现在默认在启动时运行 Wayland，同时提供了 “GNOME on Xorg” 的备选会话选项。

对于 Xfce ，Mageia 9 发行了 Xfce 4.18，现在有专门的 32 位 / 64 位的立付 DVD。

最后，我们还有 MATE 1.26.0 、Cinnamon 5.6、LXQt 1.3.0 ，这些都是 Mageia 9 提供的其它版本。

🛠️ 其他技术性变化

总结一下，以下是一些值得强调的其他更改：


同时支持 PulseAudio 和 PipeWire 声音服务器。

如果禁用了推荐软件包，将减少安装占用。

RPM 数据库现在采用 SQLite 记录，已不再使用 Berkeley DB。

对 Nvidia Optimus 笔记本进行了重大性能提升。


要了解此版本更多详情，可翻阅 发布说明。

📥 下载 Mageia 9

Mageia 9 现已可以下载，欢迎访问 官方网站 进行下载。


Mageia 9


针对现有用户，你可以按照官方提供的 方便的指南 进行升级。

💬 你对新变化有何感想？你是否一直期待着这次发布？欢迎在下方留言分享你的观点。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[不喜欢 KDE 钱包不时弹出？这里教你如何禁用它。


KDE 钱包管理器Wallet Manager 是 KDE Plasma 桌面默认包含的一个应用，用于存储和管理密码。

无论是存储网站凭据还是 SSH 密钥密码，你都可以使用 KDE 钱包来完成这一切。它与系统的其余部分集成良好，没有任何麻烦。你可以将其配置执行更多操作（或与更多应用和窗口管理器集成）。

既然 KDE 钱包是一个有用的程序，为什么要关闭它呢？

有时，当你与处理密码/凭据的操作交互时，KDE 钱包可能会弹出。因此，如果你遇到这种情况，我们的指南可以帮助你禁用钱包。



禁用 KDE 钱包的最快方法

幸运的是，你不需要使用终端或任何类型的命令来禁用它。你可以使用图形用户界面（GUI）直接从系统设置中执行此操作。

请注意，我在 KDE Plasma 27.4 上尝试过此操作。

首先，从应用坞或搜索栏打开 系统设置System Settings 应用。



接下来，从左侧边栏中的菜单中，单击 “KDE 钱包KDE Wallet”。


📋 如果你运行的是旧版本的 KDE Plasma，并且找不到下面的设置，那么需要手动安装 KDE 钱包管理器Wallet Manager（kwalletmanager）。

你可以通过 KDE 的软件中心（发现Discover 应用）执行此操作，然后返回系统设置以查找所需的选项。




这里，你可以访问钱包首选项，其中默认启用 KDE 钱包。

你所要做的就是取消选中 “启用 KDE 钱包子系统Enable the KDE wallet subsystem” 选项。



完成后，点击 “应用Apply” 使更改生效。系统可能会提示你使用密码验证操作。



确实，并不是每个 KDE Plasma 用户都使用这个钱包应用。如果它困扰你或与其他应用冲突，你只需将其禁用即可。

此外，你可以探索一些适用于 Linux 的 最佳密码管理器：

💬 你对 KDE 钱包有何看法？ 你经常使用它吗？ 之前有让你烦恼吗？ 除了默认钱包之外，你更喜欢使用什么？ 在下面的评论中分享你的想法。

should probably be pretty well-versed in that editor-cum-operating-system.
Sadly, for a variety of reasons, that is not really true, but the book and

百度方面称，还将开放一批经过全新重构的AI原生应用，让广大用户充分体验生成式AI的理解、生成、逻辑、记忆四大核心能力。


百度创始人、董事长兼首席执行官李彦宏表示，当文心一言向数以亿计互联网用户大规模开放服务后，能够获得大量真实世界中的人工反馈，这将进一步改进基础模型，并以更快速度迭代文心一言，创造更好的用户体验。


3月16日，百度宣布正式推出文心一言，并宣布开放测试邀请。彼时，李彦宏在发布会上坦言，“也不能说我们完全Ready了，文心一言对标ChatGPT、甚至是对标GPT-4，门槛是很高的。”


当时，李彦宏承认文心一言与ChatGPT之间的差距，在差距之下依旧推出，是因为“市场有需求。”


6月26日，李彦宏在“世界互联网大会数字文明尼山对话”上谈及文心一言最新进展，称百度文心大模型已经迭代到到3.5版本。与3.0版本相比，训练速度提升了2倍，推理速度提升了17倍，模型效果累计提升超过50%。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[谷歌推出用 AI 给 AIGC 图像加水印的工具

该工具名为 SynthID，最初将只提供给谷歌人工智能图像生成器 Imagen 的用户。传统的水印方法是在图像上添加可见覆盖层，或在元数据中添加信息，但这种方法很脆弱，当图片被裁剪、调整大小或编辑时，水印就会丢失。SynthID 利用神经网络来处理水印。一个神经网络获取原始图像，然后生成另一张看起来几乎一模一样的图像，但对某些像素进行了微妙的修改，这样就产生了一种人眼看不见的嵌入模式。第二个神经网络可以发现这种图案，这样即使对图片进行截图或编辑（例如旋转或调整大小），水印仍然可以被检测到。


消息来源：Technology Review



老王点评：果然是用魔法打败魔法，AI 制造的问题由 AI 解决。不过，我很怀疑会不会出现一种可以检测并去掉或扰乱这种水印的工具——即便这种水印工具不开源，也只是减缓对抗手段出现的时间。




黑客清除了 7.5 万部手机上的跟踪间谍软件

间谍软件允许用户不受限制地访问受害者的设备，其工作方式是在一个人的手机上下载一个应用程序，用一个不会被发现的身份，让监控者完全访问该设备。据报道，某不愿透露姓名的黑客声称他们入侵了间谍软件公司 WebDetetive，并删除了超过 1.5GB 信息，涉及到数万台设备，以保护受害者免受监控。这些间谍软件的用户将不会从他们的监控目标那里获得任何新数据。


消息来源：Engadget



老王点评：似乎这种“小偷”和“侠盗”的黑客故事越来越多了。




IDC 称 “PC 之死” 的报道被严重夸大

IDC 研究经理称，PC 需求 “充其量只是不温不火”，并表示 2023 年将是 “消费类个人电脑自诞生以来年度出货量降幅最大的一年”。据预测，2024 年个人电脑出货量将同比增长 3.7%，达到 2.614 亿台，高于 2018 年的水平，但与 2019 年的需求不相上下。与此同时，预计 2023 年的出货量将下降 13.7%，达到 2.52 亿台。


消息来源：The Register



老王点评：没那么严重，只是 PC 被淘汰是大势所趋。]]></summary>

截屏来捕获信息是很常见的。

但你知道你可以在 Firefox 中截取整个网页的截图吗？Firefox 附带一个内置的截图工具，允许你截取选定区域、可见屏幕区域甚至整个网页的截图。

这意味着如果你想保存网页供以后参考，你可以快速捕获整个网页。

Chrome 也有截图功能，但稍微复杂一些。

在本教程中，我将引导你完成以下内容：


如何在 Firefox 中截图

如何在 Chrome 中截图

使用 Nimbus 扩展获得比内置的截屏更多的功能


那么让我们从第一个开始。

在 Firefox 中截取网页截图

Firefox 的内置工具可让你通过单击选择整个屏幕、整个页面，甚至特定段落。

步骤 1：访问截图工具

要启动截图程序，请在使用 Firefox 时按 Ctrl + Shift + s。

如果你不总是能记住快捷方式，也可以从右键单击菜单访问该工具。



如果你经常截图，那么将该程序添加到工具栏将是一个好主意。为此，你只需执行三个简单步骤：


首先，右键单击工具栏并选择 “自定义工具栏Customize Toolbar” 选项

找到 “截图Screenshot” 程序并将其拖至工具栏

点击 “完成Done” 按钮即可


还困惑吗？ 操作方法如下：



启用后，你可以单击刚刚拖动到工具栏的截图图标。

步骤 2：在 Firefox 中截图

当你启动截图工具时，它会提示两个选项：“保存整页Save full page” 和 “保存可见Save visible”。这里：


保存整页将捕获整个网页

保存可见只会捕获当前帧中可见的内容


但如果你想捕获特定部分，你可以使…]]></summary>

今年恰逢亚当·斯密三百周年诞辰，中外学界多有纪念活动。3月，北京大学经济学院举办了纪念亚当·斯密诞辰三百周年经济思想史研讨会。4月，美国波士顿学院举办了“亚当斯密与今日资本主义”（Adam Smith and Capitalism Today）研讨会。8月初，浙江大学历史学院举办了纪念亚当·斯密诞辰三百周年国际学术研讨会。在这番盛况空前的热闹景象中，斯密的故乡苏格兰尤为引人瞩目。今年6月，格拉斯哥大学举办了“亚当·斯密三百年纪念周”（Adam Smith Tercentenary Week）；7月，国际亚当·斯密学会（International Adam Smith Society）的年会由圣安德鲁斯大学承办。苏格兰两地纪念活动规模之大，实为历年来所罕见；初入学界的年轻人在架上藏书的作者们面前报告自己的工作，“童子何知，躬逢胜饯”之心油然而生。
几年前国内一位学界前辈访问英国，由苏格兰而至伦敦，谈及风俗民情，幽默而不无严肃地沉吟道：“苏格兰人民富有德性。”我在今年夏天两次从财富密集的伦敦北上德性丰沛的苏格兰，仍能切身感受到三百年前的苏格兰先哲在财富与德性之间上下求索的心迹。回到三百年后的当下，他们的思索仍然是我们的关切，仍然构成今天的斯密学术与苏格兰启蒙运动研究的重要主题。过去与现在的对话、现实与学术的交织，因此成为这两次旅途中最为真切的感受。

格拉斯哥大学与斯密“正统”
格拉斯哥大学是亚当·斯密的母校，也是他后来长期工作的地方。《道德情感论》和《法理学讲义》就是斯密在格拉斯哥大学的工作成果。十九世纪以来，格拉斯哥大学成为斯密“正统”之所在，并于1896年设立亚当·斯密政治经济学讲席教授（Adam Smith Professor o…]]></summary>

2020年6月17日，是我博士生活结束后的第一天。迟来的清晨，仿佛让“恶战苦斗”般的生活暂时告一段落。时光倒流一百年，在1920年的6月17日这一天，同样有一个人感受到了人生中这种久违的宁静。他静静地躺在床上，聆听着家人与挚友的最后告别。三天前，1920年6月14日的夜晚，在那场夺走两千多万人生命的西班牙流感所引发的重度肺炎与高烧中，他向身边的妻子玛丽安妮·韦伯（Marianne Weber）与曾经的情人埃尔泽·雅费（Else Jaffé）喃喃道，“你们祈祷吧，让它结束！”祈祷应验了，他的世界沉寂下来，而屋外则是雷雨大作，一道道闪电划过天空，他苍白的头颅仿若已故骑士的雕像。
这个人便是我们熟悉又陌生的马克斯·韦伯（Max Weber, 1864-1920）。这是一个不时出现在课堂书本、新闻媒体乃至大众文化中的人物，是每位接受过大学教育的人都倍感熟悉的名字。但我们也会觉得他很陌生。他绝非我们的同时代人。在他生活的世界里，登月、相对论、人造卫星、不确定性原理、人类基因解码，等等，这一切都尚未出现；长崎、广岛、东欧、越南以及他念兹在兹的德国所发生的一切，也让他与我们的生活非常遥远；贵族、帝国、革命、大战、普鲁士以及亲友之间一封接连一封的手写书信才是他真实的生活世界。不过每一位韦伯研究者抑或阅读韦伯作品的人，都会自然而然地将他视为自己的“同时代人”。这并不难以理解：虽然韦伯著作的主题宏大艰深、论述缠绕交织，以至于读者需要拨开堆叠繁复的历史材料才能一窥其本来颇具穿透力的观点，但他有关资本主义、理性化过程、权力支配、正当性基础、官僚制度和信念体系的讨论，无一不切中现代社会生活的命脉。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Linux 内核 6.5 进行了一系列的改善，阅读此文以了解详情。


新版的 Linux 内核已经发布！

Linux 6.5 内核 已经推出，此次更新在 Linux 6.4 内核的基础上进行了进一步的开发，带来了值得注意的改变和新特性。

Linus Torvalds 表示，这是一次相对顺畅的发布：


上周并没有发生任何异常或惊人的事情，因此没有理由延迟 6.5 版的发布。

我仍有这样一个担忧，似乎是因为许多人都在度假，部分导致整体状态比较平静。但目前这次发布进展顺利，所以这可能只是我多虑了。上周的最大更新就仅仅是对我们自我测试的几次修订。


🆕 Linux 内核 6.5：新增了哪些功能？

需要说明的是，这次发布的版本不是长期支持（LTS）版本。如果你期望使用最新的功能，那么这个版本就是为你准备的。否则，除非此版本解决了你关心的特定问题或者能有效提升性能，否则没有升级的必要。

以下是新版内核发布的主要亮点：


AMD FreeSync 视频的即插即用支持

AMD CPU 默认启用 P-State 主动模式

对 USB4 v2 和 WiFi 7 的初步支持

ASUS ROG Ally 音效优化


开箱即用的 AMD FreeSync 视频支持



在这次发布中，重新引入的一项优秀功能是默认开启的 AMD FreeSync 视频模式支持。此特性在 Linux 内核 5.8 版本中首次引入，后因错误而被回滚。

启用 AMD FreeSync 模式后，通过将显示器的刷新率与显卡的帧率相匹配，可以显著减少游戏及视频中的屏幕撕裂和迟滞现象。

用技术词汇来描述，当它在 Linux 内核 5.8 版本中首次发布时，它的描述是：


这个补丁集启用了 FreeSync 视频模式的使用场景，这样用户空间可以请求一个…]]></summary>

it comes to syntax.  Programming languages are often made up of a (mostly)
irreducible core, with lots of sugary constructs sprinkled on top—the syntactic sugar. No one
wants to be forced to do without the extra syntax—at least not for their
favorite pieces—but it is worth looking at how a language's constructs can

老王点评：这钱真白交，我不觉得 100 年后还会有现在的互联网。




IBM 开发出新型模拟 AI 芯片，大幅降低能耗

IBM 的研究团队近期发布了一款新型的模拟 AI 芯片设计，这种基于大脑模式的芯片设计，可以模拟人脑神经网络的工作方式，实现复杂的计算任务，同时保持高效的能源使用。其性能已经达到了 GPU 的级别，却只有同等级 GPU 1/14 的能耗。这种芯片芯片使用相变存储器（PCM），PCM 不是记录数字系统中的 0 或 1，而是非晶态和晶态之间的连续值，它可将神经网络的权重直接编码到物理芯片上。IBM 的原型芯片能编码 3500 万个 PCM 装置，单个芯片最多能支持 1700 万参数的模型。


消息来源：IBM



老王点评：模拟 AI 芯片以其更低的能耗和类似人脑的处理方式，未来有望在 AI 应用中扮演更重要的角色。




Meta 发布了编程的大语言模型

Meta 发布了 Code Llama，这是一种基于 Llama 2 的新型大型语言模型，旨在通过生成和调试代码来帮助程序员。它与 ChatGPT 和 GitHub Copilot 类似，你可以用对话要求它编写代码。Code Llama 可以用 Python、Java、C++、PHP、TypeScript、C#、Bash 脚本等多种编程语言进行编程。该模型有三个规模：7B、13B 和 43B，其中 7B 和 13B 模型速度更快，更适合需要低延迟的任务，如实时代码完成，并且可以在单个消费级 GPU 上运行。


消息来源：Ars Technica



老王点评：这样说，可以在程序员自己的笔记本上跑了？另外，我才知道 Llama 这个缩写原来也是一个英文单词，意思是美洲羊驼，你知道这种动物的。]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[今天我在想 —— 当你在 Linux 上运行一个简单的 “Hello World” Python 程序时，发生了什么，就像下面这个？

print("hello world")


这就是在命令行下的情况：

$ python3 hello.py
hello world


但是在幕后，实际上有更多的事情在发生。我将描述一些发生的情况，并且（更重要的是）解释一些你可以用来查看幕后情况的工具。我们将用 readelf、strace、ldd、debugfs、/proc、ltrace、dd 和 stat。我不会讨论任何只针对 Python 的部分 —— 只研究一下当你运行任何动态链接的可执行文件时发生的事情。

0、在执行 execve 之前

要启动 Python 解释器，很多步骤都需要先行完成。那么，我们究竟在运行哪一个可执行文件呢？它在何处呢？

1、解析 python3 hello.py

Shell 将 python3 hello.py 解析成一条命令和一组参数：python3 和 ['hello.py']。

在此过程中，可能会进行一些如全局扩展等操作。举例来说，如果你执行 python3 *.py ，Shell 会将其扩展到 python3 hello.py。

2、确认 python3 的完整路径

现在，我们了解到需要执行 python3。但是，这个二进制文件的完整路径是什么呢？解决办法是使用一个名为 PATH 的特殊环境变量。

自行验证：在你的 Shell 中执行 echo $PATH。对我来说，它的输出如下：

$ echo $PATH
/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin


当执行一个命令时，Shell 将会依序在 PATH 列表中…]]></summary>

Which now brings us to today, when I’m happy to announce the formation of Zarro Boogs Corporation, which will now be overseeing the Bugzilla Project. This is a taxable non-profit non-charitable corporation - we have filed with the IRS our intent to operate under US Tax Code §501(c)(4) (still pending approval from the IRS) meaning the IRS would require us to spend money raised on project expenses and not make a profit, but money donated to us will not earn you a tax deduction because we aren’t a charity (software development is not considered a charitable cause in the US). Unlike Thunderbird, which is a subsidiary of the Mozilla Foundation, we are an independent entity not owned by or associated with the Mozilla Foundation, although they have licensed the use of the Bugzilla trademark to us.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[据周四发表的一篇博客文章称，Google正在对广告透明度和可供研究人员使用的数据进行一些调整，以符合欧洲《数字服务法案》的规定。在广告透明度方面，Google表示将"扩展"其广告透明度中心，以"满足《数字服务法案》的具体规定，并提供更多有关在欧盟提供的广告定向信息"。


Google的劳里-理查森（Laurie Richardson）和詹妮弗-弗兰纳里-奥康纳（Jennifer Flannery O'Connor）在博文中写道，该中心是Google今年早些时候推出的，是一个可搜索的信息库，可以让你更多地了解你在Google平台上看到的广告。


根据欧盟新法规，Google、Meta 和其他公司必须解释其算法。对于研究人员，这两位高管表示，Google正在"扩大研究人员的数据访问权限"，这些研究人员可能"希望更多地了解Google搜索、YouTube、Google地图、Google播放和购物是如何实际运作的，并开展与了解欧盟系统性内容风险相关的研究"。


该公司还在其他一些领域扩大透明度，包括设立另一个透明度中心以了解该公司的政策，在其透明度报告中纳入更多有关内容审核的信息，以及分享"与我们最大的在线平台和我们的搜索引擎有关的、符合DSA要求的"风险评估。


Google是最近为遵守 DSA 而做出改变的众多大型科技公司之一，DSA 使科技公司对其平台上的内容承担更多责任。例如，Instagram 宣布将为 Reels 和 Stories 添加按时间顺序排列的内容，但仅限于欧洲地区。而欧洲的 TikTok 用户将可以选择不使用为你和 Live feed 的个性化算法。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[将浏览器扩展名改用 WebExtensions 系统的主要理由之一是，它使跨浏览器扩展变得更容易。Firefox浏览器用户现在可以享受到这一承诺带来的好处，因为 Mozilla 已经在浏览器中实现了从其他浏览器导入扩展的功能。


Firefox浏览器最新稳定版的所有用户都可以用以下方法启用这项目前正在测试中的功能：



在浏览器地址栏中加载 about:config，确认后继续。


搜索

browser.migrate.chrome.extensions.enabled。


将该功能设置为"True"（启用）。


重新启动Firefox浏览器。



Mozilla 已将该功能集成到浏览器的导入功能中，用户可在首次运行时使用，也可随时从"设置"页面使用。


为此，请选择菜单 > 设置 > 导入数据（按钮），或在浏览器地址栏加载 about:preferences#general 并激活页面上的导入数据按钮。从列表中选择 Chrome 浏览器，展开可用的导入选项，并确保选中了扩展。


导入通常仅限于某些数据，如书签或浏览历史。Firefox浏览器是第一个在支持导入的列表中添加扩展功能的主流浏览器，也可能是第一个这样做的浏览器。


目前，该功能仅限于 Google Chrome 浏览器和部分扩展程序。尽管 Firefox 和 Chrome 浏览器的扩展程序使用相同的框架 WebExtensions，但它们并不能立即兼容。尝试从 Chrome 浏览器的 Web Store 安装扩展的 Firefox 用户可能会发现这一功能无法使用。


Mozilla 决定为 Chrome 网上商店和 Mozilla 附加组件商店中的扩展创建一个扩展对列表。Firefox 不会直接导入 Chrome 扩展，而是从 Mozilla 自己的扩展商店中安装扩展的 Firefox 版本。


虽然这本身很有用，因为用户可以立即在Firefox浏览器中安装一些自己喜欢的扩展，但它也有一些缺点。自定义、设置更改无法导入。这并不一定是个问题，尤其是对于那些无需任何配置即可运行的扩展来说，但这可能意味着用户必须重新进行更改，或者找到导入配置的方法（如果支持的话）。


另一个缺点是，在撰写本报告时，新的导入系统还不支持那么多扩展。Mozilla 网站上的这个页面列出了这些扩展对，目前有 73 个。


目前Firefox已经支持 uBlock Origin、LastPass、AdGuard AdBlocker、Ghostery 或 BitDefender TrafficLight 等扩展的导入。


目前Mozilla正在计划扩展该列表，以便将更多扩展对添加到导入功能中。未来还可能支持从其他浏览器导入。大多数人都依赖 Chrome 浏览器的网络商店来安装扩展，但也有一些浏览器开发商也运营自己的扩展商店。


导入扩展是一项非常有用的功能，希望今后能得到改进。Mozilla 是先行者，但 Chromium 浏览器制造商可以使用 Mozilla 的兼容扩展数据来创建自己的扩展导入。至于这种情况是否会发生，还有待观察。


Mozilla 还在努力解锁 Firefox for Android 扩展系统，以便可以安装所有兼容的扩展，而不仅仅是部分扩展。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[欧盟《数字服务法》于当地时间25号正式生效，该法规旨在保护欧洲用户免受虚假信息和仇恨言论的侵害。第一阶段，谷歌、脸书等19家在欧洲运营的大型科技公司将面临审查。欧盟负责内部市场的委员蒂埃里·布雷东当天表示，欧盟将对不符合要求的平台展开调查并处以罚款。


《数字服务法》由欧盟27个成员国商讨制定。该法案要求互联网平台企业采取更多措施删除非法和有害的在线内容，包括仇恨言论、虚假信息和假货交易信息等。


欧盟新的数字服务法案（DSA）适用于在欧洲境内运营的19个最大的大型数字平台，包括脸书、Instagram、TikTok和X（前“推特”）等，也包括大型中介商业平台，如亚马逊、扎兰多和全球速卖通。


如果想避免高额罚款，所有这些平台都必须严格遵守一系列措施，以更好地保护消费者及其网络基本权利，打击非法内容，并提高透明度及确保“欧盟单一且统一市场”。


负责内部市场的欧盟委员、DSA主要倡导者蒂埃里·布雷东表示：“全球范围内的儿童色情、网络霸凌和骚乱，已经显示出强大但不受监管的数字空间在我们的生活中所能扮演的角色。”他指出：“欧盟不再相信各个平台的善意或对法律的巧妙解释，而是决定通过明确的权利、义务和保障措施，来建立和恢复数字空间中的信任和安全。”


作为措施之一，这19个在欧洲境内拥有超过4500万用户的“超大型平台”（VLOP），本周五必须已经启用能让它们快速指出和删除非法内容的设备，为此它们必须拥有一个让用户举报非法内容的机制。


它们还必须打击虚假信息，在必要时采取缓解措施，并保护未成年人及打击性别暴力。它们还被要求更加透明，并改善问责制度。


布雷东强调说：“未成年人保护将是一个优先事项，同样的，打击虚假信息，包括亲俄罗斯宣传也是，特别是现在我们正在进入欧洲的选举期。”他认为，“内容限制并不意味着审查”，而是寻求“保护言论自由免受无凭无据的决定的影响”，同时“保护民众和我们的民主制度”。


如果不遵守新规定，平台将受到处罚，罚款最高可达其全球营业额的6%。如果“不诚信的”平台拒绝履行重要义务，“从而危及人民的生命和安全”，在所有有关方面都参与之后，作为最后手段，也可以向司法机关申请暂时中止其服务。


布雷东高兴地表示，随着DSA的生效，欧盟成为“世界上第一个网络平台不再拥有自由处理权，也不再能制定自己标准的司法管辖区；现在，它们是与金融机构一样受到监管的实体”。


他认为，遵守这一规定“不是一种惩罚，而是这些平台增强其作为可靠网站的品牌价值和声誉的机会”。欧盟二十七国正付出努力，以求走在数字立法的世界最前沿。


负责DSA的官员们表示，DSA带来的变化将是深刻而持久的，尽管其影响不一定会从本周五开始就显现出来。“就像银行业改革没有改变你的账户或抵押贷款一样，但它确实在幕后引起了很多结构性监督；DSA的许多影响不会立即就被用户看到，但我们认为它在删除非法内容方面将产生持久影响。”欧盟消息人士强调。


从2024年2月中旬开始，DSA的基本原则将适用于各类网络平台，无论其规模如何。但布鲁塞尔清楚，情况是不一样的，一个本土交易网站所具备的影响力（以及操纵能力）与脸书这样的全球巨头不同。因此，它对后一类，即所谓的“超大型平台”施加了一系列更严格的要求：制定行为准则、实施外部独立审计和公共问责制，以及给予用户不接收个性化推荐的自由等。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The OpenTF Foundation has announced that it is moving forward with its eponymous fork of HashiCorp Terraform, which was recently changed to a non-FOSS license by the company.  The organization has applied to become part of the Linux Foundation, "with the end goal of having OpenTF as part of Cloud Native Computing Foundation".  There is a GitHub repository for its manifesto, but the code repository for OpenTF is private for now, with plans to open it up in the next week or two.  Work has been going on for the last week and more developers are coming on board:

So far, four companies pledged the equivalent of 14 full-time engineers (FTEs) to the OpenTF initiative. We expect this number to at least double in the following few weeks. To give you some perspective, Terraform was effectively maintained by about 5 FTEs from HashiCorp in the last 2 years. If you don’t believe us, look at their repository. 


Some of the people behind OpenTF are participating in a Hacker News thread, so more information can be found there as well.]]></summary>
