        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I see a lot of people say it but at this point I almost feel like their just imagining their dream software reaching their dream goal rather than wayland actually fitting everyone needs in some way. There's still no support for external system tools like panels and notifications. Apps that need to set their positions for any reason just can't. I was trying to develop something and I'm just now discovering that there's no form of window ID's. And all these issues have been brought up before but the developers say "it's by design" and close the issue.
 I hear a lot of things about security and codebases and stuff but I doubt that's the reason people are using it. (Other than GNOME users who use it so that their dialogs float in the center of the window,) is anyone actually using it for a reason other than to prevent screen tearing? Is anyone just using it for fun?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[to give a little backstory i have been using ubuntu jellyfish the most recent version of ubuntu lately though ive noticed applications stop working, and window lagging when dragging the windows of different programs. I use this as a programming computer. I was looking at cutefish because of the interface and how modern and lite it looked in my opinion but after a little research i didn't go with it because of the os still being under development, which has more room for errors and bugs. I then found zorin os which was by far a great looking distro and honestly the window type looking distro really looks tempting. Im currently formatting my usb to burn the iso or zorin to give it an install. regardless im getting rid of ubuntu to many issues since i first got it. How was your experiences with zorin? Is there any major or minor bugs that made you change your mind about it? please share.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I just finished writing an essay for University and went to save it, I selected my directory and went to type the file name I wanted, unfortunately the default behaviour for nautilus (gnome-files) is to use your input for search over renaming the file you're about to save. This isn't bad, but combine that with nautilus's search crashing 50% of the time I use it, both nautilus and LibreOffice crashed loosing my work (and LO recovery did not work). 
 Luckily it was less that 1000 words so I'll be able to rewrite it pretty quickly, but it got me thinking about the little things that Gnome does that annoy me, and in my frustrations with having to rewrite the essay I thought I'd share some paper cuts I get from Gnome:
  
Nautilus search crashes and/or 'lags' making itself unusable.
 
In the new drop down, the bluetooth toggle doesn't give you an option to access the full settings page.
 Again in the drop down, my phone's internet is now a permanent option. I've only connected my phone to my PC once.
 When ejecting a USB the 'Device should not be unplugged.' message won't go away.
 When copying to a USB that uses NTFS, exFAT (and others) the progress in nautilus will be for your RAM buffer not the time it takes to copy it to the USB.
 In display setting, screens of the same resolution are shown to be the same size.
 I know this is a personal preference, but especially with multiple monitors workspaces work so much better vertically.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've been using linux as my daily driver for a long time now and I truly believe in linux and FOSS as a whole. It has so much potential that it has and can live up to in revolutionizing open computing. 
 But I'm tired. 
 I'm tired of hunting through I don't know how many different config files to change the DNS server each of which claiming to do so. I'm tired of googling to the obscure depths of the internet just to find out that there isn't and likely will never be drivers for my fingerprint reader. I'm tired of wondering if my games are going to launch or not today. I'm tired of having to find workarounds and alternatives to software with no linux support.
 Linux's customization is its greatest strength and that is also its biggest downfall. How can you provide support when there's so many different potential configurations? I'm not going to be switching back to windows, but I'm tired.

 We make a Debian based Linux distribution that runs as an application on top of Android. We recently ported our distribution to the Lenovo Tab P11 plus. This is a 11 inch midrange tablet with an optional keyboard case as well as support for 6GB memory. This combination makes for a sleek and light Linux laptop. Here is a clip of this in action:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Linux 6.1 发布，拉开 Rust 进入 Linux 内核的大幕

上周末，Linus Torvalds 发布了 Linux 内核 6.1，并开启了 6.2 的合并窗口。之所以专门提到 6.1 这个版本，是因为这个版本更具有里程碑意义。在 6.1 中，首次初步支持了 Rust，对 MGLRU 页面回收算法进行了大修，以及很多重要的特性和驱动更新。在 6.1 中没有任何供终端用户使用的 Rust 功能，而且在 6.2 中也将如此，会继续增加对开发者有用的功能，不会引入任何新的 Rust 编写的硬件驱动之类的东西。


消息来源：Phoronix



老王点评：终于尘埃落定了，以后随着内核中 Rust 代码的增多，Linux 内核的安全应该会上一个等级，就像安卓一样。




AlphaCode 是如何在编程竞赛中超过一半的程序员

AlphaCode 首先使用了 GitHub 上的庞大代码库进行训练，熟悉语法和编码规范。然后收集编程竞赛的数千个问题，训练它将问题描述翻译到代码。当遇到新问题时，AlphaCode 会编写出多达百万个候选编程方案，然后过滤掉不好的。它只保留通过测试用例的 1% 程序。为了进一步缩小范围，它会根据程序的输出与虚拟输入的相似性分群，从最大的群开始逐一递交程序，直到找到成功的程序或达到最大递交限额的 10 个程序。经过训练 AlphaCode 解决了 34% 的指定问题。


消息来源：《科学》杂志



老王点评：虽然是针对编程竞赛做的专门训练，但是完全可以针对某一类特定场景的需求进行编程，乃至于可以覆盖大多数常用场景的编程。我认为 AI 编程的时代的到来可能比我们大多数人预期的要快。




亚马逊计划干掉条形码

亚马逊称，条形码很难找到，而且可能被贴在形状怪异的产品上，这是机器人不能很好地解决的问题。因此，该公司说它有一个干掉条形码的计划。亚马逊利用仓库中物品的照片训练了一个计算机模型，让机器人在捡起和翻转物品时识别物品。这个被称为多模式识别的系统并不打算很快完全取代条形码，但该公司表示，它加快了处理包裹的时间。


消息来源：CNET



老王点评：确实，随着人工智能的发展，条形码可能就成了过渡性技术了。


回音


Chrome 110 中 取消 了对 JPEG-XL 的 支持，用户和开发者反对无效。]]></summary>

To be fair, there was no reason for me to leave the i3 ,my setup works just fine , but I wanted to see what the fuss was about, try out "the latest and greatest", and maybe pave a way to me finally getting some HiDPI monitors.
 So, I installed Sway onto my computer, spent several days recreating my setup and then spent couple of weeks using it as my daily driver. Over time I have encountered many issues, small and large and I have managed to find the workaround for most of them, but in the end several issues irked me enough that I have decided to go back to i3 (and X11).
 Following are the descriptions of the most annoying/surprising issues that I have faced.

Now we are going to deep dive into the time namespaces.
 By using time namespaces we can separate/isolate/segregate and thus virtualize the values of two system clocks (https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/time_namespaces.7.html). We are talking about “CLOCK_MONOTONIC” and “CLOCK_BOOTTIME”.
 “CLOCK_MONOTONIC” goal is to represent an absolute elapsed wall-clock time since some arbitrary, fixed point in the past. It is important to understand that it isn't affected by changes in the system time-of-day clock. As opposed to “CLOCK_REALTIME” which can chan…]]></summary>

1776年，美国革命者在大陆会议表决通过了由杰斐逊主导撰写《独立宣言》。在面向世界各国陈述殖民地脱离大不列颠的理由时，《宣言》诉诸了在十七、十八世纪流行的自然法与自然权利的理论。其中第二段指出：“我们认为下面这些真理是自明的：造物者创造了平等的个人，并赋予他们若干不可转让的权利，其中包括生命、自由和追求幸福的权利。为了保障这些权利，才在人们之间成立了政府。”《宣言》认为，一旦政府背离这些目的，人民就有权改变或废除它。在卡尔·贝克尔看来，《宣言》实际上是通过阐述一套普遍性的政治哲学，来为殖民地的反叛提供道德和法律上的正当基础。这种政治哲学无疑主要来源于约翰·洛克，《宣言》最具理论性的第二段几乎完整表述了洛克有关同意和革命的政治理论，因此甚至为杰斐逊招来了剽窃《政府论》的指控。
但是，若我们细察《宣言》列举的那三项“不可转让的权利”，出人意料的是，它们并非洛克惯常并列的“生命、自由和财产”。相反，财产权在这里被替换成了“追求幸福的权利”。“追求幸福”（Pursuit of Happiness）这个表述来自何处，它又是如何进入《宣言》文本的，便成了一个颇具意味的问题。在追索这一表述之起源的过程中，研究者逐渐锁定了不同的目标。事实上，洛克本人也使用过“追求幸福”这个表述，尽管不是和生命与自由并列，其他一些候选人还包括威廉·沃拉斯顿（William Wollaston）、塞缪尔·约翰逊等等。戴维•伍顿（David Wootton）最近在研究中通过检索“早期英文图书在线”（Early English Books Online）等数据库，一下子将这个名单扩展到包括坎伯兰（Richard Cumberland）、弗格森（Adam Ferguson）、休谟在内的一百…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[一个简单的教学展示，教你如何找到正在运行中的进程 ID 并杀死它，你可以使用终端或者 GUI，这个方法适用于各类 Linux 发行版。


你的 Linux 系统中运行的应用可能会让你的电脑变慢，特别是你的电脑配置较低的时候。在 Linux （以及所有其他 OS）中，程序或者应用都携带一个特别的 PID （进程 ID）可供你简单地分辨它们。

然而，大部分 Linux 初学者用户并不知道如何在 Linux 中寻找运行中的进程并杀死它。在这篇指南中，我们将会解释用不同的方法以杀死 Linux 中的运行进程。这包括了使用终端和 GUI 的方法。

记住，你只应该杀死未响应的进程，或者你发现应用无法被正常关闭 （针对基于 GUI 的应用）。

如何在 Linux 中找到 PID 并杀掉它们

在这一部分中，我们首先应该先学会如何找到运行进程的 PID，然后再学习用以杀掉它们的命令：

找到正在运行中的进程

你可以使用命令 top 来列出所有正在进行中的进程和它们的 PID，以及其他细节。程序 top 在所有 Linux 发行版和所有基于 Unix 的系统中都是默认安装了的。

top




同样地，你可以执行命令 ps 附带额外选项来获取某个指定的进程的 PID。例如，你可以使用以下命令来获得 firefox 的 PID。

ps -el | grep -i firefox




现在你已经找到 PID 了，让我们看看你该如何杀掉它。

杀死运行中的进程

使用以下命令，你可以通过进程的名字或者 PID 来杀掉这个正在运行中的进程：


killall：通过运行进程的名字来杀死进程

kill：通过 PID 来杀死进程


现在，让我们首先使用进程 killall 通过 Firefox 这个名字来杀死它的，命令如下：

This is because a Wayland client is expected to define its own pointer (cursor) and that seems to lead to inconsistencies between implementations. I do not have a problem with CSD being default on Wayland (I even prefer it when done really well, like Telegram Desktop, or any GTK app with GtkHeaderBar) but the cursor switching scale while moving it over surfaces (windows) is much more jarring.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Linus has released the 6.1 kernel; he is preparing for a tricky holiday merge window:

So here we are, a week late, but last week was nice and slow, and I'm
much happier about the state of 6.1 than I was a couple of weeks ago
when things didn't seem to be slowing down.

Of course, that means that now we have the merge window from hell,
just before the holidays, with me having some pre-holiday travel
coming up too. So while delaying things for a week was the right thing
to do, it does make the timing for the 6.2 merge window awkward.



Headline features in 6.1 include
reworked, LLVM-based control-flow
integrity,
initial support for kernel development in
Rust,
support for destructive BPF programs,
some significant io_uring performance improvements,
better user-space control over transparent
huge-page creation,
improved memory-tiering support,
fundamental memory-management rewrites in the form of the multi-generational LRU and the maple tree data structure,
the kernel
memory sanitizer,
and much more.  See the LWN merge-window summaries (part 1, part 2)  and the KernelNewbies 6.1 page for
more information.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Nemo 感觉像是更新版的 GNOME 2 文件管理器。我喜欢它，我觉得你也会喜欢它。


计算机是一个奇特的文件柜，里面装满了虚拟文件夹和文件，等待着被引用、交叉引用、编辑、更新、保存、复制、移动、重命名和归类。在本文中，我将介绍一下 Linux 系统的文件管理器。

Cinnamon 项目是使用 GNOME 3 的组件重新实现的 GNOME 2。最终，它的差异足以成为一个真正的分叉，如今，Cinnamon 桌面使用 GTK3 库和 GNOME 3 关键应用的分叉版本来创建一个“经典”的 GNOME 体验。对传统的 GNOME 体验做出贡献的组件之一是 Nemo，它是一个基于 GNOME 2 版本的 Nautilus 的文件管理器。

在 Linux 上安装 Nemo

Nemo 的源代码 在线提供，但它需要 cinnamon-desktop 来构建，所以安装 Nemo 最简单的方法是直接安装 Cinnamon。

在 Fedora、Mageia 和类似的系统上：

$ sudo dnf install cinnamon-desktop


在 Linux Mint、Debian 和类似系统上：

$ sudo dnf install cinnamon-desktop-environment


当然，作为该桌面的发源地，Linux Mint 也预装了 Cinnamon。

一个熟悉的界面

如果你已经习惯了 GNOME，无论是过去的还是现在的，那么 Nemo 从一开始就让你有一种回家的感觉。它有一个熟悉的外观和感觉，在类似的地方有按钮和选项，你很可能会认出它们。



将视图控制按钮放在右上方的 GNOME 式惯例被保留了下来，你可以使用这些按钮快速地将你的文件视图从大图标切换到详细列表或紧凑视图。那里还有一个搜索功能，以及在可编辑文本和按钮之间切换位置栏的选项。

可编辑的 URI 栏有时被低估了。这是一个简单的设计决定，但它可以是一个有助于提高效率的巨大功能。这就像在每个窗口的顶部有一个单行终端，你可以在那里输入你的系统的任何目标位置，并立即被带到那里。而且你甚至不需要输入 cd。

在左上角，有导航按钮：向上、向前和向后。与许多 Linux 文件管理器一样，你可以用 Alt 键加上适当的 箭头 键，而放弃使用这些按钮。

侧面窗格显示了重要文件夹的列表（主目录、文档、下载等），可以通过点击窗口底部的一个按钮来隐藏或显示。

熟悉但不一样

Nemo 的舒适性和熟悉性并不意味着它只是无意识地模仿 Nautilus。Nemo 有一系列不错的功能，感觉很独特。其中大部分都在 偏好设置Preferences 中，以下是我最喜欢的几个：


窗口标题中显示全路径Full path in window title：这是我最喜欢的功能。不要再怀疑你在文件系统中的位置了。让你的窗口标题告诉你。

单击或双击Single or double click：如果你是一个长期的 KDE 用户，你可能会发现单次点击打开一个文件是很新鲜的。有了 Nemo，你可以这样选择。

双击来重命名Double-click to rename：如果你使用单击来打开，为什么不重新利用双击来重命名呢？

在新窗口中打开每个文件夹Open each folder in a new window：操作系统为每一个打开的文件夹打开一个新的窗口。

插件Plugins：Nemo 有能力调用动作、脚本和扩展。有些已经包括在内，有改变桌面背景、创建启动器和挂载归档的动作。其他的还没有被创建，但这种可扩展性对开源是至关重要的。


一切近在咫尺

在 Linux Mint 上使用 Nemo 几周后，一个有趣的特征让我眼前一亮。似乎 Nemo 可以，或者通过快速配置可以，让我最常使用的所有东西都近在咫尺。许多功能，我承认，我不知道我是否需要，直到 Nemo 让我轻松点击才知道。你可能会说，我是为了满足 Nemo 的设计而改变了我的使用方式，也许情况确实如此。但是，当这种体验是如此令人愉快和有效时，这有什么关系呢？

Nemo 是一个很好的文件管理器。它让人想起了 GNOME 2 的时代，但其更新和设计选择让人有一种新鲜的感觉。如果你喜欢 Thunar 或 Nautilus，你会喜欢 Nemo。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Java 不再是最受欢迎的三大编程语言之一

根据最新的 TIOBE 指数，现在的排名是：Python 排名第一，C 第二，C++ 第三，Java 第四。2001 年以来，TIOBE 指数历史上 C++ 第一次超过了 Java。C++ 的激增，部分原因可能要归功于 2020 年 12 月发布的 C++ 20 稳定版。但在其它排行榜和调查中，Java 的表现更好。比如 Slashdata 数据显示，Java 在过去两年中以全球开发者社区两倍的速度增长，在社区规模中排名第三，超过了 C/C++，仅次于 Python 和 JavaScript。


消息来源：The Register



老王点评：我觉得语言排行榜的每次变化，除了给我添加一些话题之外，没啥意义。




谷歌再次推迟淘汰 MV2 扩展

谷歌推行的 Manifest V3 浏览器扩展规范，相比 V2 扩展，新版本增加了很多有利于谷歌的限制，比如限制广告屏蔽扩展。谷歌 原计划 在明年 1 月淘汰 MV3 扩展，但 MV3 仍存在一些问题，导致一些扩展没法迁移。这一期限被延迟到明年 6 月后，谷歌再次宣布推迟淘汰 MV2 扩展，但没有确定具体时间，谷歌表示要在 2023 年 3 月前听取开发者的更多反馈。


消息来源：谷歌



老王点评：谷歌审慎的态度很好，但是其本质上还是希望推进 MV3 的实施。




Adobe 公开发布 PostScript 源代码

Adobe 公司成立之初，他们就着手设计一种打印机无关的排版语言 PostScript，并于 1984 年发布。PostScript 本质上是一种数字化的印刷系统，它提供了其他任何地方都无法提供的能力，如文字和图像可以随意缩放、旋转和移动。如今大多数打印机都直接依赖 PostScript 技术，或者通过从它发展出来的 PDF 技术。而在它诞生近 40 年后，Adobe 公司通过计算机历史博物馆首次公开了 PostScript 的源代码。


消息来源：计算机历史博物馆



老王点评：这是印刷史上的一个里程碑，只是我没想到使用这么广泛的系统，源代码现在才公开。]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[这是一种帮助开源开发者获得报酬的令人兴奋的方式。




Tea 是一个开源的统一软件包管理器，被全球许多开发者使用。

顺便说一句，Tea 是 Homebrew 的创建者的一个新项目。

在最近的一份公告中，他们宣布已经筹集了 890 万美元的种子资金，并计划推出一个新的 Web3 协议，帮助开源开发者为他们的工作获得报酬。

我是通过 TechCrunch 上发表的一篇文章看到的，他们对 Tea 的创始人进行了访谈。

让我们来看看 Tea 的发展情况。

Tea 提出的一项新协议

它是什么？

简而言之： 该协议将帮助软件包维护者获得不可伪造的代币（NFT），作为他们对带有 Tea 支持的开源项目的贡献的奖励。

展开来说就是，这是一个 Web3 协议，将帮助软件包维护者以不可伪造的通证（NFT）的形式获得报酬。

当维护者完成了一个软件包的提交，他们将收到一个不可伪造的通证（NFT），可以作为他们工作和贡献的证据。

现有的维护者也将能够通过将软件包的 NFT 转让给其他开发者来转移软件包的维护所有权。


这些 NFT 是 Tea 计划奖励其用户的核心。


实施这一点还将涉及被称为“包支持者”和“赞助者”的实体。

这些人包括组织、软件包用户、慈善家和企业家，他们使用开源软件来构建商业产品，并希望支持这样一个生态系统。

他们还提到：


为了提供最广泛的覆盖面，我们认为奖励不能依靠跟踪安装或卸载这样简单的概念，而是要依靠激励机制，鼓励提交高质量的软件包和报告邪恶或高风险的软件包。


**到目前为止，Tea 只发布了他们所说的 “同类 CLI（命令行界面）工具应具备的基本功能”。

到目前为止，还没有提到这个新协议的具体发布日期，他们对这个协议发布的最佳估计是“2023 年的某个时候”。

他们补充说：


就像等到 11 月才发布我们的 CLI一样，我们会在了解它应该如何最好地构建并在内部经历了试验和错误之后才发布。

我们要慢慢来，确保这个工具本身对开发者非常有用和有价值。


它有什么帮助？

根据 Tea 公司的说法： 这应该有助于他们为所有开源软件创建一个开放、公开和稳定的注册中心。

反过来，鼓励项目独立发布版本，而不是依赖第三方，因为第三方会不可预测地收集他们的数据，导致大量的分立和经常重复的系统。

以下是他们对该协议的目标的描述：


Tea 的目标是通过 Tea 通证的独特用例来实现去中心化的激励机制，让 Tea 社区的任何成员为开源的永久可持续性和持续增长作出贡献。

包的支持者和赞助者可以根据他们的工作、信仰或任何影响他们决定的标准和尺度，自由决定他们要支持哪些包或包维护者。


在我看来： 这是一个令人兴奋的方法，可以奖励那些经常被忽视的开源贡献者，即使他们为各种开源项目贡献了很多。

然而，考虑到 NFT 在最近一段时间获得了很多批评。这可能会或可能不会有好的结果。

如果你想了解更多，你可以深入研究它的官方 白皮书 上的协议。

 Anyone else long for the days when shit DIDN'T just work? Like... having to compile some ridiculous driver from a long discontinued dot-matrix printer source to get the modem to dial out and even though the keyboard layout was wrong you dealt with it and if you accidentally pressed a certain key combo (no - you don't know what the combo was and you sure as hell didn't want to F around and find out) but your machine crashed a horrible crash when you pressed it? 
 It's probably the tinkering that I miss the most..... Something very motivational about that...
 Did you know? The Apple IIe had a voice simulator!? You could (sorta) make it curse: 
 "I have to take a shift."
 "I have the biggest dam peanuts you ever saw"
 That was a god-skill in my small world then.... My class of more than 8 was impressed. ;-)
 Remember this?
 It was your 5th attempt at compiling $XYZ when it finally built! Of course the application itself did not function but it did compile so there's that.
 You did some crazy file copy/paste/modify shit to get your audio to output anything - even a fart sound.
 That lesson on boot loaders... the really hard one ...because you only had one slow-ass machine with a a broken boot loader.
 The 3rd time you swore you'd never do that effing Gentoo install on Pentium II ever ever again!
 I've used only desktop Linux at home for more than twenty five years now and today at work as well although I do have a wondows machine for this one weird app for which there is no replacement.
 Oh how things change.....
 These days, anyone accepting my assistance gets a desktop Linux experience - I simply can't be bothered otherwise.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[陆大鹏、孟钟捷（章静绘）

谈及德意志贵族这个群体，中国读者的印象往往如堕五里雾中。一方面，相关的历史源流错综复杂，难以厘清；另一方面，人们又往往容易受到各种先入为主的刻板印象的影响。知名译者陆大鹏长期关注欧洲贵族文化，对德意志贵族有深入研究。最近他推出了专著《德意志贵族》，在与华东师范大学历史学系孟钟捷教授的对谈中，他们对德意志贵族的概念定义与历史渊源做了梳理和介绍。

《德意志贵族：一个群体的生活、历史与命运》，陆大鹏著，上海人民出版社2022年10月出版，735页，108.00元

国内读者认识大鹏，可能更多的是通过各种译著。具体到《德意志贵族》这本书，能否介绍一下写作缘起？
陆大鹏：作为一名翻译工作者，我翻译了一些欧洲历史题材的书籍。同时，我也一直爱好欧洲史。我从大学时代就开始学习德文，对德国历史尤其感兴趣。在翻译欧洲历史相关著作的过程中，我发现了一些很有意思的细节问题。比如，德国历史上很多贵族头衔或者机构的专名，翻译都是大有讲究的，而中文世界的相关翻译比较混乱，也不够准确。就拿大家都很熟悉的那位普鲁士军事家国王“腓特烈大帝”为例，事实上，“大帝”这个译名并不准确，确切来说应该是“大王”，因为他从来没有当过皇帝，只做过国王，当时的德意志另有皇帝；“腓特烈”也是一个比较老的译名，现在最好还是用“弗里德里希”这个更接近德语发音的译名。弗里德里希继承普鲁士王位的时候，他的头衔是“在普鲁士的国王”，过了一段时间他把头衔改成了“普鲁士国王”——一词之差，其实有着颇多深意，但在中文翻译的时候，这些深意往往就丢失了。
所以，我发现很多有意思的德国史细节值得讨论，但在中文世界里还讲得太少，逐渐萌生写这本《德意志贵族》的想法。我在书中花了一些篇幅讨论，很多概念怎么译成中文比较好，以及这些概念的起源和历史演变是怎么样的。有一位朋友开玩笑说：“这本书建议做世界史出版的编辑人手一本，因为可…]]></summary>

My goal is to keep the open source drivers but be able to run apps, OR install other drivers. I have tried using drivers that aren't open kernel and those have worked, but I would prefer to have the open kernel tested drivers.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The HP Smart App forces you to agree to use only their ink before you can use their app.   That shouldn't be a big deal since modern HP printers work fine out of the box without a driver.
However, after you've printed a bunch of pages, they stop working and display the error message "Printer setup incomplete. Your HP+ printer must be set up using the HP Smart app. Visit 123.hp.com to download the app and complete the guided setup. Any pages you have printed were intended for setup and have been exhausted."
Conveniently, this usually doesn't happen until it's too late to return the printer.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[今年即将迈入尾声，你还记得今年透过 Google 搜索过什么吗？12月7日，谷歌发表了台湾 2022 年度搜索排行榜（Year in Search），回顾台湾网友今年最关心的事。受疫情与不同防疫措施推行，今年防疫专线“1922”成为快速窜升关键字榜首，“快筛地图”、“疫苗预约”与疫情相关议题仍备受台湾网友关注。不仅国内相关议题，国际间重大突发事件也引发台湾民众高度关心，“乌克兰”、“安倍晋三”相关搜索也急遽窜升。另外，网友也特别关注国内外体育赛事，正在卡达如火如荼举行的“世足赛”和加入全新队伍的“中华职棒”都拥有高人气讨论热度，纷纷上榜。


疫情关键字搜索热度仍高　国际重大突发事件备受瞩目


随着 COVID-19 病毒株持续变异并造成多波本土确诊，在今年十大快速窜升关键字中，与疫情相关的关键字包含“1922”、“快筛地图”、“疫苗预约”等仍占多数，可见台湾网友仍然相当关心疫情发展与防疫措施。此外，今年国际间发生的重大突发事件也引发讨论，包含“乌克兰”的战争冲突与前日本首相“安倍晋三”的意外事件，显示台湾民众身为世界公民，高度关注国际间所发生重大事件与动向。


在疫情与国际事件外，四年一度的“世足赛”正在卡达热闹开踢，也带起台湾网友的足球热潮。本届赛事在开赛前就备受关注，不仅是世足赛首度于冬季举办，明星球员阵容和不奋战到最后不知鹿死谁手的精彩赛况，也迅速掀起广大讨论。台湾网友也同样关注国内体育赛事，尽管上半年赛程受到疫情影响，“中华职棒”不仅迎来全新队伍加入，为赛事注入新动力，更再次举办过去两年受疫情影响而停办的明星对抗赛，引起广大讨论话题，成为年度前十大快速窜升关键字。


而在快速窜升议题方面，今年台湾网友热切关注人身安全、公共意外与民生面向议题。其中，台湾人赴海外寻求高薪工作机会的诈骗事件与后续事件发展，以及韩国热门旅游景点在万圣节期间不幸发生重…]]></summary>

大约百分之一的 Copilot 建议可能包含超过 150 个字符的代码片段，这与训练集的代码相匹配，而这些代码是从各种软件许可证下的公共在线源代码中挑选出来的。为了避免滥用公共代码带来的风险，个人用户可以每月支付 10 美元，从而过滤公共源代码。而对于使用其商业版的企业用户，其 IT 管理员可以企业可以设置政策控制，避免采用公共源代码。并且，根据企业客户协议，如果采用了 Copilot 建议的代码而被起诉的话，GitHub 将为其企业客户辩护和提供高达 50 万美元的索赔。

老王点评：果然，并不是 Copilot 能力不行，而是 VIP 服务是需要花钱的。




Chrome 引入节能和节省内存模式

Chrome 一直被诟病占用内存过高。新的节省内存模式通过将不活跃标签进入睡眠模式而能节省最多 30% 的内存。用户重新访问睡眠的标签时会重新加载。节能模式则在笔记本电池水平低于 20% 时限制网站的后台活动和动画视频的视觉效果。休眠不活跃标签的功能最初是微软在 Edge 浏览器中引入的，微软曾 宣布 它在一个月内休眠了 60 亿个标签，节省了超过 273 PB 的内存。


消息来源：Tech Crunch



老王点评：微软放弃自己的浏览器内核而基于 Chromium 开发 Edge，实际上对 Chrome 的发展提供了很多帮助。




Dart 语言将提供健全的 NULL 安全

NULL 最初在 1964 出现在 ALGOL 语言中，其发明人称这是他的“十亿美元错误”，因为 NULL 导致的错误修复花费了大量的时间和金钱。谷歌的 Dart 语言从 2.12 版本开始支持健全的 NULL 安全，以防止访问设置为 NULL 的变量而出错，但它还保留了运行没有 NULL 安全或部分 NULL 安全的代码的模式。将在 2023 年发布的 Dart 3 将只支持健全 NULL 安全。并非每一种 NULL 安全的实现都是如此确定，例如，TypeScript 就是不健全的，C# 和 Kotlin 也有例外。


消息来源：The Register



老王点评：感觉 Dart 语言不是很流行，但是这个功能却很有意义。]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[代码中的缩进指的是你在代码行的开头处的空格。像其他代码编辑器和 IDE 一样，VSCode 允许你自动缩进你的代码。

你可以设置使用制表符或空格或任何你喜欢的缩进方式。

听起来不错吧？让我们来看看怎么做。

在 VSCode 中启用自动缩进

你有多种方法可以实现这个目标。在本指南中，我将向你展示三种在 VSCode 中自动缩进代码的方法。

方法 1：配置全局用户设置

你可以通过命令模式访问全局用户设置。使用 Ctrl + Shift + P 来打开命令模式，搜索 Open User Settings 并按下回车：



它将打开设置。在那里，你需要搜索 Auto Indent，并在 “编辑器：自动缩进Editor: Auto Indent” 中选择 “全部Full”：



接着自动缩进会被启用，并应用于 VSCode 中每个打开的文件。

方法 2：在 VSCode 中使用检查器或格式化工具进行自动缩进

在这种方法中，你需要添加扩展程序，如代码格式化工具或者检查器，以获得理想的结果。

检查器Linter会识别代码中的错误，而格式化工具Formatter只对你的代码进行格式化，使其更具可读性。你可以在 VSCode 市场 中搜索特定于你的编程语言的代码格式化器。

这里有一些我最喜欢的广泛流行语言的代码格式化工具和检查器：


C/C++：适用于 C 和 C++ 编程语言。

PHP：适用于 PHP。

markdownlint：适用于 Markdown 文件。

Python：适用于 Python 编程语言。

ESLint：适用于 JSON 和 javascript。

Beautify: 适用于 JavaScript、JSON、CSS、SASS 和 HTML。


当你为你喜欢的编程语言添加了格式化工具，你可以按 Ctrl + Shift + I 来格式化代码。

同样地，你也可以使用命令模式做同样的事情。按 Ctrl + Shift + P，并搜索 Format document，然后按下回车。



方法 3：在保存文件时启用自动缩进功能

VSCode 允许你在保存你的代码时，通过一个小小的调整来格式化它。让我告诉你怎么做。

按 Ctrl + ,，它将打开用户设置提示。在那里，搜索 Format On Save。



从现在开始，当你保存文件时，你的文件将自动添加缩进。

总结

在本指南中，我解释了如何在 VSCode 中自动添加缩进。我建议使用第二种方法以获得更好的灵活性。

我希望你会发现本指南对你有帮助，如果你有任何疑问或建议，请在评论中告诉我。

继《西周的灭亡：中国早期国家的地理和政治危机》和《西周的政体：中国早期的官僚制度和国家》之后，《早期中国：社会与文化史》是美国哥伦比亚大学东亚语言与文化系教授李峰先生新近在国内出版的又一部重要著作。本书的英文版最早在2013年由剑桥大学出版社收入“亚洲历史的新研究”丛书出版，在2014年出版修订本，此后又出版了韩文版和繁体中文版。本书的题目为“早期中国：社会与文化史”，但其内容不仅包括了早期中国社会和文化的各个方面，我们还可以从中读到与政治制度、官僚机构、经济技术、战争、法律、思想、信仰等各个领域有关的内容。由于李峰先生兼具考古学、古文字学、历史学以及东西方学术的功底，不仅治学非常严谨，而且极为关注各个研究领域中最为前沿的研究成果，因此书中看似信手拈来的一句话、一段表述，多是一个重要研究领域中最新研究成果的综合表达。正因为如此，《早期中国》自2013年出版后，就得到国内外学者的高度评价。简体中文版出版后，三联书店亦以此为契机，召集了包括考古学、历史学在内的学者和李峰先生一起举办了题为“比较视野下的早期中国”的新知大会，对“早期中国”的概念，“早期中国”的发展历程，尤其是早于夏纪年的新石器时代的“早期中国”和商周时期的“早期中国”的不同发展阶段，中国的“早期国家”与世界其他国家和地区“早期国家”的比较，以及所涉及的相关理论问题等，进行了非常深入的讨论。这些评价和讨论，为我们阅读和理解这本著作起到了非常好的引导作用。
从中国近年来出版的许多考古学著作和历史学著作的标题，都带有“早期中国”或“中国”看，就知道李峰先生的这本著作所聚焦的“早期中国”是国内学术界目前非常关注的一个研究领域。而在上个世纪七十年代，西方汉学界就开始出版名为“早期中国”（Early Chi…]]></summary>

FOAF 标准（朋友的朋友Friend of a Friend），是一个可以追溯到本世纪初的网络标准，目前它基本上已经不再使用了，或者说被人们忘记了，亦或者说已经被取代了 [1]。它暗示了，假如 Facebook 没有征服世界的话，FOAF 将会定义我们今天所用的社交网络。不过在开始探讨这一网络标准之前，我想先来谈一谈纽约地铁。

目前，纽约地铁的唯一管理机构是 大都会运输署Metropolitan Transportation Agency（简称 MTA）。MTA 垄断了纽约市的地铁交通。在纽约乘地铁必须先从 MTA 购买车票，否则属于非法行为。也就是说，MTA 在地铁行业没有任何竞争对手。

不过，以前可不是这样。说起来可能有些让人吃惊，纽约市的地铁交通曾由两家企业相互竞争，共同运营。跨区捷运公司Inter-borough Rapid Transit Company（IRT）的势力范围是穿过曼哈顿的线路，布鲁克林-曼哈顿运输股份有限公司Brooklyn-Manhattan Transit Corporation（BMT）管理的则是布鲁克林区内的线路，其中也有部分线路延伸到了曼哈顿。1932 年，纽约市开通使用了自己的服务，称为独立地铁系统，与 IRT 和 BMT 展开竞争，所以当时纽约共有三家不同公司控制着市内地铁交通。

可能会有人觉得这样的地铁运营效率不高。事实上也确是如此。由于 IRT 和 BMT 投入使用的列车宽度不同，所以在不同的运营系统之间建造换乘站十分困难。此外，乘客换乘时还需向不同的运营商支付费用，这就意味着在换乘站至少要设置两个不同的检票区域。后来，纽约市于 1940 年接管了 IRT 和 BMT，将整个纽约市的地铁交通置于一家运营商的管…]]></summary>

 sudo grub-mkconfig -o /boot/grub/grub.cfg
 Reboot your laptop and hopefully brightness should work

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello all,
Very excited to share this project with you all!
Panoptisch scans your Python file or module to find it's imports (aka dependencies) and recursively does so for all dependencies and sub-dependencies. It then generates a dependency tree in JSON for you to parse and enforce import policies.
Supply chain attacks are no joke, and this is one way to transparently analyze your dependencies to see if any malicious imports are taking place. For example, your yaml parser, nor it's sub-dependencies should import socket, or sys.
Panoptisch is in early stages, with known limitations (for now). I welcome feedback, testing and contributions.
Also, happy to answer any questions!

 Can someone explain this attitude of some Linux users?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello, we just launched the alpha release of Pynecone - a way to build full-stack web apps in pure Python. The framework is easy to get started with even without previous web dev experience and is completely open source / free to use.
We made Pynecone for Python devs who want to make web apps, but don’t want the overhead of having to learn or use Javascript. We wanted more flexibility than existing Python frameworks like Streamlit/Dash that don't allow the user to make real, customizable web apps.
With Pynecone, you can make anything from a small data science/python project to a full-scale, multi page web app.  We have over 60+ built-in components and are adding more.
We are actively trying to grow this project so no matter you skill level we welcome contributions! Open up an issue if you find missing features/bugs or contribute to existing issue.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Google正在桌面上引入“连续滚动”功能，这样用户就不必多次点击鼠标跨页浏览以找到相关的搜索结果，该公司在移动端提供的这一功能已经扩展了一段时间。值得注意的是，用户不应该把连续滚动误认为是无限滚动。通过连续滚动，用户在看到“更多”按钮寻找更多结果之前，可以通过向下滚动看到最多六页的搜索结果。


在移动设备上，Google将连续滚动限制在一次看四页搜索结果。


Google历来对搜索结果采取“分页”的方式。这意味着，在这之前，当用户向下滚动搜索结果页面并想看到更多结果时，他们必须点击底部的页码。


这项新功能还可以为那些排名不够高的网站提供更多的能见度，使其进入第一页，通常人们倾向于避免进入第二页，很少有人去看之后的页面。因此网上有这样一个笑话：藏匿具有犯罪危害性的东西的最佳地点是Google搜索结果的第二页。


这一变化发生在许多用户抱怨Google搜索结果质量下降的时候。作为回应，Google已经做出了一系列改变，包括使搜索结果更加直观。9月，它还推出了一项功能，在一个名为“讨论和论坛”的栏目下浮现来自Reddit和Quora的结果。


虽然很多功能都采用了移动优先的设计，但Google也在努力加强桌面搜索。例如，该公司正在测试主屏幕上的widget风格的卡片，让用户能够一目了然地获得天气和股票等信息。

一、傅斯年所赠拉丁语读本
1939年暑假，在湖南教书的金克木至昆明访友，见到罗常培（1899-1958）。罗又把他引荐给傅斯年（1896-1950）。一番交谈之后，傅以一册拉丁语读本相赠。关于傅斯年和他送的这本书，金克木在《自撰火化铭》（《群言》1993年第7期）和《忘了的名人》（金克木《百年投影》，北京大学出版社，1997年10月第一版，206-208页）等文中做过回忆，后者所述更为详细：
“不懂希腊文，不看原始资料，研究什么希腊史。”他接着讲一通希腊、罗马，忽然问我：“你学不学希腊文？我有一部用德文教希腊文的书，一共三本，非常好，可以送给你。”我连忙推辞，说我的德文程度还不够用作工具去学另一种语文。……他…]]></summary>

DeepMind 在《科学》杂志发布文章说，在至少有 5000 人参加的在线编码比赛中，AlphaCode 的表现超过了 45.7% 的程序员。令人惊讶的是，研究人员将其产生的程序与训练数据库中的程序进行了比较，发现它并没有重复大段的代码或逻辑，而产生了一些新的代码。这让专家们注意到了递归式自我改进的软件的长期风险，这可能导致超级智能的人工智能接管世界。专家们希望尽早为人工智能编码领域建立护栏。

老王点评：在科幻小说中，阿西莫夫创造性的提出了《机器人三定律》，而就目前的发展来看，可能要制定更具体的限制规则，让人工智能的递归式发展具有自限性。




费米实验室和 CERN 选择 AlmaLinux

在 2021 年底，CentOS 项目停止了 CentOS Linux 的更新，并以滚动版的 CentOS Stream 取代，重建了红帽的 Linux 开发和维护流程。很多使用 CentOS Linux 的企业转而使用其他的替代版本，如 AlmaLinux 和 Rocky Linux，以及国内的 AnolisOS 和 openEuler。著名的科学研究机构费米实验室和欧洲粒子物理研究所（CERN）发表联合声明，宣布将在其研究设施中采用 AlmaLinux。声明称，AlmaLinux 的优点包括：每个大版本支持寿命长，支持扩展架构，快速的发布周期，上游社区贡献，支持安全建议元数据，完美兼容红帽的企业版 Linux（RHEL）。

苹果公司昨天宣布，将在更多敏感类型的 iCloud 数据上采用端到端加密，这包括设备备份、信息、照片等，以满足用户和隐私团体的长期需求。这意味着只有受信任的设备才能解密和读取用户存储在 iCloud 中的数据。FBI 表示它“深切关注端到端加密和只允许用户访问的加密所带来的威胁”。它表示端到端加密使该机构更难开展工作，要求“通过设计进行合法访问”。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[只要对汇编有一点基本的了解，这些函数就能扩展到任意位长的整型数学运算。


几年前，我为 FreeDOS 写了一个叫做 VMATH 的命令行数学程序。它只能在很小的无符号整型上执行十分简单的数学运算。随着近来 FreeDOS 社区里对基础数学的兴趣，我改进了 VMATH 使其可以为有符号 64 位整型提供基本的数学支持。

仅使用 16 位 8086 兼容的汇编指令来操控大型数字的过程并不简单。我希望能够分享一些在 VMATH 中用到的技术例子。其中一些方法掌握起来相当容易。而另外一些方法则看起来有点奇怪。你甚至可能学到一种进行基本数学运算的全新方式。

接下来要讲的加、减、乘、除会用到的技术将不局限于并不局限于 64 位整型。只要对汇编有一点基本的了解，这些函数就能扩展到任意位长的整型数学运算。

在深入研究这些数学函数前，我想先从计算机的角度介绍一下数字的一些基本知识。

计算机是如何读取数字的

一个英特尔兼容的 CPU 以字节Byte的形式贮存数字，储存顺序为从最低有效字节到最高有效字节。每个字节由 8 个二进位Bit组成，两个字节组成一个字Word。

一个储存在内存里的 64 位整型占用了 8 个字节（即 4 个字）。例如，数字 74565（十六进制表示为 0x12345）的值长得是这个样子的：

用字节表示：db 0x45, 0x23, 0x01, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00
用字表示：dw 0x2345, 0x0001, 0x0000, 0x0000


当读取或写入数据到内存时，CPU 会以正确的顺序处理这些字节。对于比 8086 更现代的处理器而言，数据分组可以再大些，比如一个四字组Quadword就可以表达整个 64 位整型 0x0000000000012345。

8086 CPU 不能理解这么…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello, over the past few years i have been hearing a lot about people wanting linux to become more mainstream. This has a few problems in my eye. First, as the community gets bigger, there is bound to be more corporate involvement, and im afraid that eventually linux would turn into the proprietary garbage windows and mac have. Second, as it gets bigger, there will be kore security issues discovered and exploited. Third, the linux community is tight knit and i dont want it to become like the alternatives without any community.

 I have been searching high and low, for a good 10 months, with no answers. I bought this laptop to use it to its fullest, and am using linux. I was very close to scrapping everything and going back to windows, forgoing all my previous comforts and customization. Hence, this post would hopefully serve as a stopping point to fellow Linux users googling this issue, so that we all can happily use our favourite linux Distro without any qualms, while making full use of the hardware we aquired. Touchscreen folding laptop is such a gamechanger in Uni, and Linux provides an unlimited potential and ease of use and customisation. I wish Linux got not just Laptop support, but more support with current existing hardware.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey HN! Wasp (https://wasp-lang.dev/) is a simple config language (DSL) and framework for building full-stack web apps. You describe the high-level features you want (auth, CRUD, async jobs, …) using the Wasp DSL, and write the rest of your logic in React, Node.js, and Prisma. We’re focused on simplifying developer experience and ensuring best practices. Everything is open source.
Why another full-stack framework? And why a config language/DSL? We were still experiencing a lot of boilerplate (repetitive tasks) using other frameworks—things like duplicating data models across database/server/client, implementing CRUD API, setting up auth, and choosing and stitching together all parts of the stack.
There are two main reasons for the DSL approach - 1) short-term: simpler and cleaner DX via a …]]></summary>

        <id>https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33910863</id>
        <link href="https://beta.sayhello.so/"/>
        <updated>2022-12-08T17:53:53.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We’ve trained a generative AI model to browse the web and answer questions/retrieve code snippets directly. Unlike ChatGPT, it has access to primary sources and is able to cite them when you hover over an answer (click on the text to go to the source being cited). We also show regular Bing results side-by-side with our AI answer.
The model is an 11-billion parameter T5-derivative that has been fine-tuned on feedback given on hundreds of thousands of searches done (anonymously) on our platform. Giving the model web access lessens its burden to need to store a snapshot of human knowledge within its parameters. Rather, it knows how to piece together primary sources in a natural and informative way. Using our own model is also an order of magnitude cheaper than relying on GPT.
A drawback to aligning models to web results is that they are less inclined to generate complete solutions/answers to questions where good primary sources don’t exist. Answers generated without underlying citable sources can be more creative but are prone to errors. In the future, we will show both types of answers.
Examples:
https://beta.sayhello.so/search?q=set+cookie+in+fastapi
https://beta.sayhello.so/search?q=What+did+Paul+Graham+learn...
https://beta.sayhello.so/search?q=How+to+get+command+line+pa...
https://beta.sayhello.so/search?q=why+did+Elon+Musk+buy+twit...
Would love to hear your thoughts.

        <updated>2022-12-08T11:24:23.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[苹果公司今天推出了高级数据保护机制，这是一种新的、可选择的端到端加密方案，可以防止客户的iCloud中的数据在"不受信任的"设备上被解密。具体来说，高级数据保护可以保证iCloud账户的大部分数据安全，即使苹果公司被黑客攻击，而且--正如《华尔街日报》的一篇文章所指出的--可以防止苹果公司根据执法要求访问iCloud手机备份。


高级数据保护目前在美国适用于苹果测试版软件计划的成员，并将在今年年底向所有美国用户开放（世界其他地区将在2023年跟进），高级数据保护使iCloud用户的可信设备（如iPhone和Mac）能够单独访问他们大部分数据的加密密钥。(加密密钥是专门生成的随机比特串，用于扰乱和解密数据）。一旦启用该功能，苹果服务器就不能代表用户修改某些iCloud设置，或访问存储在iCloud备份、照片、笔记和第三方开发者选择标记为加密的CloudKit字段中的数据。


在推出高级数据保护之前，iCloud用户无法阻止苹果公司翻阅设备备份的内容，包括文本信息和联系人，如果它选择这样做的话。


读者可能还记得这家科技巨头与美国联邦调查局(FBI)就圣伯纳迪诺枪手的加密iPhone数据进行的斗争，在此期间，该机构试图通过法庭迫使苹果解锁受保护的iPhone。当时，苹果公司辩称，联邦调查局可以通过其服务器上未加密的iCloud备份来获取其寻求的数据。


值得注意的是，高级数据保护功能不能与iWork协作工具、照片中的共享相册、iCloud邮件、联系人或日历一起使用；苹果将此归咎于互操作性要求。要启用该功能，用户必须为他们的苹果ID注册双因素认证，并在他们的设备上设置密码或通行证，以及将这些设备更新到最新的可用软件（iOS 16.2、iPadOS 16.2、macOS 13.1、tvOS 16.2、watchOS 9.2和最新版本的iCloud forWindows）。


苹果在一份支持文件中澄清说，高级数据保护还不支持管理的Apple ID和子账户。


需要注意的是，如果没有为高级数据保护设置恢复方法，出现数据丢失的后果相当严重。苹果指出，如果恢复失败，例如，如果恢复联系人的信息已经过时，任何加密的iCloud数据都如同丢失一样。


除了高级数据保护，苹果今天上午还宣布了其他两项与安全有关的功能，将进入其产品生态系统：iMessage联系人密钥验证和安全密钥。


iMessage联系人密钥验证允许"面临特殊数字威胁"的用户，如记者和政府成员，选择进一步验证他们只与他们想要的人发送消息。苹果公司表示，如果对手侵入云服务器窃听加密通信，iMessage联系人密钥验证将发出警报，并允许用户亲自在FaceTime上或通过安全电话比对一个特殊的ID验证联系人的验证码。


同时，安全密钥建立在苹果现有的双因素认证系统之上，要求将硬件安全密钥作为验证一个人的Apple ID证书的两个因素之一。硬件钥匙有各种不同的样式和价位，通常使用蓝牙、NFC或USB来进行认证。


苹果公司表示，iMessage联系密钥验证和Apple ID安全密钥将于2023年开始在全球范围内提供。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[美国将斥资 15 亿美元启动华为替代方案

美国认为，少数海外公司制造蜂窝网络核心设备存在经济和国家安全风险，计划投资 15 亿美元到开放无线电接入网（ORAN），帮助推动基于标准的现代蜂窝网络核心设备的替代方案。它使用标准的计算设备来取代诺基亚、爱立信和华为等公司的专有硬件。不过，现有的网络运营商转而使用这种装备存在很多困难。


消息来源：Axios



老王点评：ORAN 听起来似乎挺好，但是实际如何呢？




GCC 即将加入对 Rust 的支持

GCC 不仅仅是 C 语言的编译器，其实它是“GNU 编译器集合”，所以它能支持很多语言的编译。GCC 的 Rust 前端项目 Gccrs 已被批准合并到 GCC 主分支，下一个版本的 GCC 将能编译 Rust 源代码。GCC 编译器支持的目标平台的数量要远多于标准的 Rust 编译器。开发者表示 Gccrs 仍然极具实验性，在发布之前会有很多变化。


消息来源：Phoronix



老王点评：要是能用 GCC 编译 Rust，那对 Rust 的发展应该是加速器。




一堆 X.org 组件得到了更新，但无关紧要

过去一周，有 20 个 X.org 软件组件得到了更新。长期维护者 Alan Coopersmith 每当准备为 Solaris 发布更新时，就会发布大量的 X.Org 更新。但这些更新大多无足轻重。Linux 基本上都迁移到了 Wayland，只有一些 Solaris 和 BSD 还继续使用 X.org。


消息来源：Phoronix



老王点评：这真是象征性的工作，表示 X.org 还继续活着而已。

Fedora 获准 开发 移动版 Fedora，采用 Phosh 合成器，预计将在明年春季发布的 Fedora 38 里出现。

旧金山参事会第一次投票同意 武装机器人 的提案后，遭到了强烈抗议，因而在通常只是走个形式的第二次投票中 逆转 了该批准。最终投票将一周后举行。]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Kali Linux 2022.4 现在已经可以下载了。从这里了解它的新内容。




Kali Linux 是一个开源的、基于 Debian 的发行版，专注于渗透测试和安全审计。

它由各种工具、配置和自动化脚本组成，以帮助你实现这一目标。

作为今年的最后一个版本，Kali Linux 2022.4 与其 前一个版本 相比有许多改进。

让我带你了解这个版本。

🆕 有什么新变化？



Kali Linux 2022.4 以更新的形式早早带来了圣诞礼物；这里有一些快乐的东西！🎄


Linux 内核 6.0

返回微软 Azure 市场

支持 Pine 64 的 PinePhone

新的桌面环境

QEMU 镜像

新的工具


支持 Pine 64 的 PinePhone



Kali Linux 现在已经正式支持 Pine 64 的 PinePhone 和 PinePhone Pro。

这种支持是以一种新的以移动为重点的发行版的形式出现的，名为 “Kali NetHunter Pro”。

他们把它标记为 Kali Linux 和 NetHunter 的一个新的起点；这个发行版已经为移动设备进行了优化，可以从 SD 卡上与主操作系统一起双启动。

此外，他们还暗示未来将发布 Kali NetHunter Pro 的替代版本。

这些版本将以 Plasma Mobile 为特色，同时提供了新的安装程序，可以将 Kali NetHunter Pro 安装到设备的内部闪存中。

返回微软 Azure 市场



在离开 Azure 市场很长时间后，Kali Linux 终于被 添加回来 了。

Kali Linux 背后的公司 Offensive Security 提到，借助 kali-cloud build-scripts，现在发布过程已经自动化了。

用户现在将享受与他们的 亚马逊 AWS 镜像 相同的一致性水平。

新的桌面环境



通常情况下，Kali Linux 使用轻量级的 Xfce 桌面环境作为其默认的桌面环境。

但现在，它也支持最近的 KDE Plasma 和 GNOME。

在 Plasma 方面： Kali Linux 现在采用了 KDE Plasma 5.26；改善了整体的桌面体验，并引入了许多调整和改进。

在 GNOME 方面： 包括了 GNOME 43 的常规增强，他们也增加了一些自己的调整。

在 adw-gtk3 项目的基础上增加了一个新的基于 GTK3 的主题，并加入了一些 Kali 的调整。

然后，新的 GNOME 文本编辑器取代了 Gedit，并带有一个更新的 Kali 主题。

QEMU 镜像

他们还在预生成的镜像库中增加了一个新的 QEMU 镜像，希望它能让人们更容易在 Proxmox Virtual Environments、virt-manager 或 libvirt 等自托管环境中部署 Kali Linux。

🛠️ 其他变化/改进措施

除了上述变化，还有其他几个值得注意的变化：


增强了对 Kali NetHunter 的蓝牙支持。

增加了 Kali 对树莓派镜像烧录工具的支持。

USBArmory MKII 中的 u-boot 引导加载器已经更新到 2022.10。

更新了各种 Kali 文档。

新的工具，如 bloodhound.py、certipy、rizin-cutter 等等。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[这篇指南可以让你如何摆脱 Ubuntu 的无趣的登录背景屏幕，并在你每次登录时设置一张漂亮的图片来欢迎你。


我总是认为，在你启动你的系统后，应该有一个漂亮的登录屏幕来欢迎你。这本身就为你即将开始的工作或活动渲染了愉快的氛围。尽管，我不是一名 Windows 的粉丝，但是我很欣赏 Windows 10 的登录背景都会每天随着 Bing 壁纸进行更改，它看起来好极了，对吧？

前段时间，我们讨论了如何 更改 Fedora 的登录屏幕背景 和 更改 elementary OS 的登录屏幕背景 。现在这篇指南将向你解释，如何更改使用 GNOME Shell 的 Ubuntu 的登录屏幕背景。

登录屏幕背景是显示管理器（DM）属性的一部分。这篇指南将使用一位用户在 GitHub 中创建的一个脚本，使得普通用户也能简单易用。否则，你需要在提取 .gresource 文件后，必须手动更改 Gnome 显示管理器Gnome Display Manager（GDM）的 CSS 文件，接下来再编译它。一般来说，这是很复杂的。



更改 Ubuntu 的登录背景

打开一个终端（按下组合键 CTRL+ALT+T）。

使用下面的命令，下载这个 GitHub 仓库 ：

wget github.com/thiggy01/change-gdm-background/raw/master/change-gdm-background


注意: 如果你没有 wget ，使用 sudo apt install wget 来安装它。


Ubuntu 22.04 Jammy Jellyfish 用户需要更改一些额外的代码来使其工作，因为，在 GitHub 仓库中，开发者没有修复它。因此，在这里你需要自己来更改。

使用 gedit 来打开 change-gdm-background 文件。接下来，转到下面的行（#15） 并添加 |jammy 。



接下来，转到下面的两行（#144 和 #184）。将 gdm3.css 更改为 gdm.css 。如下图所示。



最后，保存文件，并遵循如下的操作指南。这种解决方法只适用于 Ubuntu 22.04 的登录屏幕的更改。


更改脚本的权限来使其可执行：

chmod +x change-gdm-background


接下来，更改 Ubuntu 的登录背景壁纸，使用下面的命令。按照你的图片相应地更改路径：

sudo ./change-gdm-background ~/Pictures/tree.jpg


这一步骤可能需要 libglib2.0-dev 软件包，它将会自动地安装。提取和编译 .gresource 会用到它。

在安装后，它应该会提示你重新启动 GDM 。慎重起见，按下 N 按键。

注销后，你可以看到更改后的 Ubuntu 的背景。

如果你没有看到更改，尝试重新启动你的系统，然后尝试登录。



恢复先前的登录屏幕

该脚本也提供了一种恢复先前的登录屏幕的特色功能。它在更改你的 .gresource 文件前，会将其进行备份。因此，恢复先前的登录屏幕，只需要在终端中简单地运行下面的命令。

sudo ./change-gdm-background --restore


这应该会将其登录屏幕更改回其先前的形式。

请在下面的评论框中，让我知道这篇指南的内容是否对你有效果，这应该适用于所有的最新版本的 Ubuntu Linux 。

美国历史学家弗里茨·斯特恩在《文化绝望的政治》一书中将纳粹主义的兴起视为德国文化传统和时代氛围相结合的必然产物，而非“偶然事件”（operational accident）。该书原为作者博士学位论文（后于1961年出版成书），论文导师是哥伦比亚大学教授、美国著名文化史家雅克·巴尔赞（Jacques Barzun）。受巴尔赞“三人传记式”历史研究法启迪，斯特恩选择十九世纪晚期至二十世纪早期德国三位文化批评家——保罗·德·拉加德，尤利乌斯·朗本和阿图尔·默勒·范登布鲁克——作为研究对象，展示当时德国知识界普遍弥漫的对现代世界的厌恶（尤其是对市场经济和民主政治的厌恶），以及由于西方文明（Zivilisation）侵蚀导致传统文化（Kultur）丧失而感受到的绝望——即“文化绝望”。由此，斯特恩将这一历史时期的保守主义革命定义为“文化绝望的政治”，认为其代表人物试图“摧毁遭人唾弃的当下，以便在想象的未来中重塑理想化的过去”，纯属病态的乌托邦冲动。在本书“前言”部分，斯特恩坦言他进行的是“文化批评的病理学研究”，暗示上述三位末日先知是其所处时代疾病之表征，同时亦是将德国导向纳粹主义的病理性动因。
保守主义革命是斯特恩对三位代表人物乌托邦式战略的统称——他们的保守主义并非捍卫现存状态，而是捍卫理想化的过去，捍卫现代世界之前的德国“古老传统”。在这一传统中，德国人民在强大的领袖——如腓特烈大帝或“铁血宰相”俾斯麦——领导之下，以宗教相联，以血缘互系，同仇敌忾，在欧洲雄霸一方。从这个意义上说，三位代表人物致力打造的其实是“怀旧的乌托邦”——自查理大帝以来，“神圣罗马帝国”在欧洲独享千年荣光——与魏玛共和国（Weimarer Republik）的涣散无力恰成…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[了解 for 循环结构和你在控制它时拥有的选项，这样你可以对如何在 Lua 中处理数据做出聪明的决定。


在编程中，迭代是一个重要的概念，因为代码通常必须多次扫描一组数据，以便它可以单独处理每个项目。控制结构使你能够根据通常在程序运行时动态建立的条件来指导程序的流程。不同的语言提供不同的控制，在 Lua 中，有 while 循环、for 循环和 repeat until 循环。本文介绍 for 循环。我将在另一篇文章中介绍 while 和 repeat until 循环。

for 循环

for 循环接受已知数量的项目并确保处理每个项目。“项目”可以是数字，它也可以是一个包含多个条目或任何 Lua 数据类型的表。语法和逻辑有点灵活，但语法允许这些参数，每个参数本质上描述了一个计数器：


计数器的起始值

停止值

你希望计数器前进的增量


例如，假设你有三个项目并希望 Lua 处理每个项目。你的计数器可以从 3 开始一直持续到 1，增量为 -1。这呈现为 3、2、1 的计数。

mytable = { "zombie", "Halloween", "apocalypse" }
for count = 3, 1, -1 do
  print(count .. ": " .. mytable[count])
end


运行代码以确保所有三个项目都得到处理：

$ lua ./for.lua
3: apocalypse
2: Halloween
1: zombie


这段代码有效地“反向”处理了表，因为它是倒数。你可以正数：

for count = 1, 3, 1 do
  print(mytable[count])
end


此示例从最低索引到最高索引处理表：

$ lua ./for.lua
1: zo…]]></summary>

directory trees, while also providing integrity verification for the data
and the 
directory metadata, was recently posted as an
RFC
to the linux-kernel mailing list.  Composefs was developed
by Alexander Larsson (who posted it) and Giuseppe Scrivano for use by podman containers and OSTree (or "libostree" as it
is now known) root directories, but there are likely others who want the
abilities 
it provides.  So far, there has been little response, either with feedback or
complaints, but it is a small patch set (around 2K lines of code) and
generally self-contained since it is a filesystem, so it would not be a
surprise to see it appear in some upcoming kernel.]]></summary>

 When I logged back into awesomeWM (even after a restart), I was surprised to see KRunner instead of Ulauncher when hitting Alt+Space. I also noticed the kde emoji picker was popping up instead of the one, I usually use.
 So yeah, looks like everything the fact about having multiple WMs/DEs installed wirhout interfering doesn't apply to KDE.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Our Hosting provider, Hetzner, has recently started charging for public IPv4 addresses - as they should! Those numbers started getting expensive. This prompted me to try and set up a new server cluster using IPv6 exclusively, and see how far I could get before having to give in and purchase an additional v4 address.
The experiment ended much sooner than I had anticipated. Some of the road blocks I hit along the way:
  - The GitHub API and its code load endpoints are not reachable via IPv6, making it impossible to download release artefacts from many projects, lots of which distribute their software via GitHub exclusively (Prometheus for instance).
  - The default Ubuntu key servers aren't reachable via IPv6, making it difficult to install packages from third-party registries, such as Docker or Grafana. While debugging, I noticed huge swaths of the GPG infrastructure are defunct: There aren't many key servers left at all, and the only one I found actually working via IPv6 was pgpkeys.eu.
  - BitBucket cannot deploy to IPv6 hosts, as pipelines don't support IPv6 at all. You can self-host a pipeline runner and connect to it via v6, BUT it needs to have a dual stack - otherwise the runner won't start.
  - Hetzner itself doesn't even provide their own API via IPv6 (which we talk to for in-cluster service discovery. Oh, the irony.

安全专家们观察到一个利用 SSH 连接和脆弱的登录凭证来感染目标的僵尸网络 KmsdBot，该僵尸网络能够挖掘加密货币和发动 DDoS 攻击。专家发现，在该网络接收到一条格式错误的控制指令后，导致该僵尸网络瘫痪，并停止了其攻击。这条错误指令丢失了 URL 和端口号参数之间的空格，由于提供了错误的参数数量，出现了“索引超出范围”的错误，而导致 Go 程序崩溃。


消息来源：The Register



老王点评：编程错误经常有，而观察到僵尸网络因为一个编程错误而崩溃的机会却不多。估计背后的恶意黑客正在叹气。

新版 WinAMP 增加了对音乐 NFT 的支持

沉寂多年的 WinAMP 于今年 8 月复活，发布了一个 5.9 版本。现在它发布了一个修正版本，修复了一些错误和更新了一些组件。在此版本中，WinAMP 出人意料的添加对 NFT 的支持，只是这种 NFT 不是图片而是音视频。其称，“好处是艺术家可以通过创造稀缺性（例如发布独特或限量的曲目），和从歌迷之间的 NFT 的二手销售中获得分成来赚更多的钱。”


消息来源：Ars Technica



老王点评：说实话，我觉得与其将心思放在 NFT 上，不如好好重构 WinAMP。]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[前不久，欧拉社区发布了今年的创新版本 openEuler 22.09。作为欧拉社区贡献给开放原子开源基金会后的首个创新版本，此版本中新增了 2012 万行代码，其中仅在 Linux 内核上就新增了 4.8 万行代码，全量代码已达 6.7 亿行！

openEuler 采用长期支持（LTS）版本和创新版本间隔的发布方式，每两年发布一个 LTS 版本，期间每半年发布一个创新版本，用于推出实验性的技术特性。本次发布的 openEuler 22.09 创新版就带有不少的创新特性。但是在欧拉社区官方发布的公告中，并没有特别详细地介绍这些特性，因此，我特别邀约了华为服务器 OS 首席架构师、openEuler 社区技术委员会委员熊伟来为我们解读了本次发布中的一些最新、最酷的技术特性。

从内核说起

在本次的 openEuler 22.09 发布公告中提及了若干技术特性，比如可编程内核、分布式软总线、嵌入式硬实时，这些新的名称给人一种似曾相识，但又不明其中奥秘的感觉。作为欧拉技术委员会的专家，熊伟针对我的好奇，给出了他的解答：

什么是可编程内核？

“可编程内核”这个名词是我最迷惑的 —— 内核难道不是代码吗？肯定是编程产生的，那这个“可编程”的意思是什么？

对此，熊伟首先解释了“可编程内核”产生的背景，“现在的硬件迭代变化非常快，但是相对而言，软件的变化就有点跟不上。比如说，芯片一般的生命周期就三年，你得花一年时间上传到上游，半年后进入内核社区，而从社区到用户手里还有很长的周期。本质原因在于内核相对是固定的，一次开发完成以后，编译成内核模块后就相对固定了。”因此，openEuler 创新性地借鉴了  eBPF 的思想，将机制和框架分离，框架内置到内核，而实现的功能和策略只需要写完以后注入到内核即可。

在实现上，主要是两个方面：

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[基于 Kali Linux 的 Linux 滚动发行版 Gnoppix 22.12 带来了 GNOME 43、Linux 内核 6.0 和新的升级。




作为传统的现场 CD 发行版 Knoppix 项目的继承者，Gnoppix Linux 是专门为渗透测试和反向工程而设计的。它为网页应用安全和数字权利保护进行了优化。除了对安全的关注，Gnoppix 也可以作为一个普通的桌面操作系统使用。它是一个滚动的版本，经常收到更新和新功能。

在其核心部分，它基于 Kali Linux，并采用了 Debian-rolling 的某些部分。与 Kali Linux 的 Xfce 相比，它采用的是 GNOME 桌面。

Gnoppix Linux 22.12 的最新变化

目前的主要版本是 Gnoppix 22，它是一个持续的小版本发布，最近其团队发布了 Gnoppix 22.12，有以下更新。

首先，内核版本被提升到了 Linux 内核 6.0 ，采用了最新的 GNOME 43.2 桌面。如果你想把这个发行版作为桌面使用，那么默认的应用程序列表会给你带来一些好消息。

Gnoppix 22.12 增加了 GIMP 图像编辑器、Deluge & Transmission、Clapper 音乐播放器和 GNOME 固件更新器。

此外，所有的 GNOME 原生软件包都被升级到了 43.2 版本，同时团队开始着手开发 44 版本，该版本将于 2023 年 2 月发布。



其他关键组件和应用程序包括以下内容：


LibreOffice 7.4.2.3

Linux 主线内核 6.0.7

OpenJDK 11

pipewire 0.3.60

Firefox ESR 102

Python 3.10


Gnoppix Linux 还默认增加了几个微软的应用程序。在这个版本中，你可以得到微软 Edge 浏览器 107 和用于会议和通信的微软 Teams 预览版。

在完整的变更日志中有一个巨大的软件包更新列表，你可以在 这里 中找到。

下载

如果你想尝试一下，你可以使用以下链接下载它。


下载 Gnoppix 22.12


请记住，它是在现场介质中使用的理想选择。然而，你可以很容易地在你的硬件上安装它，并作为 Debian-GNOME-rolling 版本运行。另外，请注意，它需要至少 50GB 的磁盘空间来安装！这是其 Calamares 安装程序的一个硬性要求。

此外，Kali Linux 的软件仓库已经被添加到 /etc/apt/sources.list 中，来自 Debian-rolling 的软件包基本稳定，所以，它应该是很稳定的。

干杯。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[“哈佛燕京图书馆藏民国时期文献”当中有一本署名“茅盾”的文学作品《铁树花》，让笔者眼前一亮。随着探究的深入，笔者知道已有前辈提到该书，而且背后的故事说来话长。
叶子铭先生的《茅盾漫评》（百花文艺出版社，1983年6月第1版）一书，收录其八十年代初为沪《书林》杂志所作的“茅盾书话”六篇，饶有趣味。末篇《访美所见几种茅盾作品的盗版书》详载了1982年春他在马里兰大学与哈佛大学发现多种茅盾作品的盗版书的经过。

此图摄自笔者自藏本

叶子铭先是在马里兰大学东亚图书馆的一个排列茅盾作品的书架上，看见“几种新奇而陌生的书名”——《少女的心》《青春的梦》《小城春秋》《朝露》《风波》《中秋之夜》，当即起了疑心，欲一查究竟。无奈时间紧，他只好请工作人员帮忙复印这些书的目录与版权页。热心的工作人员不仅给他复印了所需的资料以及东亚图书馆所藏的茅盾著作目录卡片，还通过电脑复印了一份密歇根大学图书馆所藏的茅盾著作和茅盾研究的目录卡片。巧合的是，在密歇根大学图书馆的这套目录卡片中，除了《风波》《朝露》《青春的梦》《少女的心》《中秋之夜》《小城春秋》都赫然在目，另外还有两本，即《幸福的蓝图》（署“茅盾等著”）和《铁树花》。至此，已经出现八种让他心生疑窦的茅盾作品。
事情的真相终于在哈佛燕京图书馆基本弄清。在这个世界闻名的图书馆里，同样藏有这些新奇而陌生的茅盾作品。可见，这些书在美国各大图书馆相当常见。但它们在国内图书馆难以见到，叶子铭先生深觉“更有加以澄清之必要”。这回因为事先有准备，他利用短暂的参观时间，“迅速地、逐本地翻阅了原文”，很快确定是“香港书商耍了欺世盗财的手段，把茅盾早期短篇小说集《野蔷薇》里的《自杀》《一个女性》及以后的《陀螺》《小巫》等改换个新奇的题目作为书名，再拉上茅盾其他一些短篇，凑成了一些集子，以广招徕”。他根据查阅情况，指出五种书肯定是盗版书，并加以说明，现转引如下：

一
王太庆先生（1922-1999），哲学教授，专精西方古典哲学。他以翻译西方哲学知名，是近代继严复、林纾（康有为诗称“译才并世数严林”）、冯承钧（胡文辉诗称“汉学东传谁译笔，乾坤一手大挪移”）之后又一位造诣高深的翻译家，法、德、英、俄、古希腊、拉丁文著作均能胜任，译品众多，译笔以准确而晓畅著称。笔者曾在读书期间有幸认识王先生，得到熏陶教诲。今年是王先生诞辰满一百年，谨撰此小文以为纪念。
王先生是安徽铜陵人，中学时代离开故乡，前往上海，寄读于有外国教员任教的实业学校，得以较早受到西方文化浸染，课余博览群书：
我上初中接触了声光化电，可是最感兴趣的是希腊故事，再就是文天祥的《正气歌》、史可法的《复多尔衮书》。念法文我偏喜欢看圣女贞德的抗英事迹，《马赛曲》也能背。进了高中，工厂实习成绩平平，假日却爱上四马路，到书店里站着看书，从尼采的《苏鲁支语录》看起，直看到杜兰的《哲学的故事》。看得似懂非懂，还想再读些别的；也正因为自己知道有许多东西不懂，想求助于别人写的文章，进一步把它弄懂，但是没有成功，因为我不懂的地方别人也很少说。我自己意识到中国人到哪里去的问题从根本上说是个哲学问题，但是我听来的那点哲学还远不够用。（《王太庆自述》，方克立、王其水主编《二十世纪中国哲学》第二卷《人物志》，华夏出版社，1995年，674页）
《苏鲁支语录》是尼采著作，徐梵澄译本（商务印书馆1937年初版，今通译《查拉图斯特拉如是说》）。杜兰《哲学的故事》，是上世纪前半段的世界畅销哲学读物：Will Durant, The story of philosophy: The lives and opinions of the greater philosophers（New York: Simon & Schuster, 1926），当时此书有多种中译本，作者名译为“杜兰”、书名作《哲学的故事》的…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[刘安志（章静绘）

点校本“二十四史”及《清史稿》修订工程自2005年启动以来，2013年推出了第一部修订本《史记》，此后陆续推出《旧五代史》《新五代史》《辽史》《魏书》《南齐书》《宋书》《隋书》《金史》《梁书》与《陈书》修订本。《周书》修订本也于近日面世。主持《周书》修订的刘安志教授系武汉大学历史学院院长，主要研究领域为魏晋南北朝隋唐史与敦煌吐鲁番文书，著有《吐鲁番文书总目（日本收藏卷）》《敦煌吐鲁番文书与唐代西域史研究》《新资料与中古文史论稿》等。在接受《上海书评》专访时，刘教授对相关问题作了详尽、深入的说明。

关于《周书》及其编撰者令狐德棻，能否请您简单介绍一下相关情况？
刘安志：《周书》又名《后周书》，是唐令狐德棻主持编纂，岑文本、崔仁师等参与修撰的官修纪传体正史。全书五十卷，其中本纪八卷，列传四十二卷。《周书》虽以周题名，实际上记述的是从公元534年北魏分裂为东魏、西魏到581年杨坚代周建隋为止四十八年的西魏、北周史。
令狐德棻（583-666）是唐初著名史学家，其家世居敦煌，为当地大族。德棻祖父令狐整，在北周曾官至大将军、始丰二州刺史。其父令狐煕，自幼“博览群书，尤明三礼”，北周时官至司勋、吏部二曹中大夫，入隋后历任鸿胪卿、兼吏部尚书、桂州总管等（《隋书》卷五六《令狐煕传》）。德棻出生于官僚世家，“博涉文史，早知名”。他在唐高宗朝官至国子祭酒，参加过《艺文类聚》《氏族志》《贞观新礼》及永徽律令的撰定，又主持或参与唐修《晋书》《五代史志》及太宗与高宗两朝实录的编纂，并监修国史，史称：“德棻暮年尤勤于著述，国家凡有修撰，无不参预。”（《旧唐书》卷七三《令狐德棻传》）
唐朝开国之初，因承隋末大乱，经籍图书散佚不完，令狐德棻遂向高祖李渊奏请“购募遗书”，派人抄写。武德四年（621），德棻又奏请编修前代正史。次年，唐高祖下诏命中书令萧瑀等编修魏、周、隋、梁、齐、陈史书，…]]></summary>

当我与别人谈到 Git 时，几乎每个人都对 git rebase 命令 有强烈的印象，这个命令让许多人遇到了问题，而不得不更改目录、删除仓库、然后再重新克隆一个仓库。我认为这是因为他们误解了分支是如何工作，遇到了一个非常糟糕的默认界面，还有一些合并冲突把事情搞得一团糟。

怎么找不到 git squash 命令？

如果你曾在本地的仓库提交过很多次，并希望能把这些提交都合并为一个提交，接下来，我们就来介绍能用什么 Git 命令达到这个目的。Git 称这个概念为 “压扁提交squash commits”。我在编写文档时发现了这个概念：我花了十几个提交才修改好我的 Markdown 文档，但是仓库的维护者不想看到我的所有尝试，以免扰乱了该项目的历史，所以我被告知“需要压扁你的提交”。

压扁提交听起来是一个很有用的方法。但是只有一个问题：我不知道该怎么做。作为 Git 的新手，我做了任何人会做的事情：我去查阅 git-squash 的手册，但我立即遇到了阻碍：

$ man git-squash
> No manual entry for git-squash


我发现没有一个名为 squash 的 Git 命令，而是被要求 运行一个完全独立的命令：git rebase 命令，该命令能将我的所有提交最终合并为一个提交。

我知道我碰到一个常见的情形：已经使用工具一段时间的人使用了行话或引用了一个概念，这个概念对他们来说是非常清楚的，但对新手来说就不能明白了。从概念上讲，这个情况看起来是这样的：



我这样说是为了鼓励你，你绝对不是第一个或最后一个 被 Git 或谈论 Git 的人 弄糊涂的人。你可以要求对方说明白他的意见，并帮助你应该使用的正确命令。仓库的维护者实际上的意思是，“使用 git rebas…]]></summary>

 I love Linux, it's great. Things just became easier when I started using it. Here's the issue: people say that Linux isn't good for the average user... I am actually going to take that even further and say "Linux isn't good for anyone who isn't a programmer".
 I am not biased one way or another, and I agree with the FOSS philosophy and everything like that. However, being completely honest here, I am not going to use a program if it provides me no significant benefit over what I am already using.
 The keyword here is "significant". People say things about how Linux respects your privacy. How FOSS is better than…]]></summary>

 I'm just curious to know what's preventing Linux from having a simple way to install apps.
 I know there are repositories that are very easy to use, but they are still limited to a certain amount of apps.
 Flatpaks and .appimages are really cool, but the have limitations. eg. I'm struggling at the moment with a flatpak because it's sandboxed.
 What do you think? Are there any projects attempting to tackle this?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Over on the Collabora blog, Adrian Ratiu writes about the addition of the kernel's Rust code to the KernelCI automated kernel testing project.  The blog post looks at what it took to add the support and on some plans for future additions, as well.

An interesting challenge for the rustc docker builds was the fact that the standard Rust method of installing toolchains is via curl https://sh.rustup.rs | sh which might be ok-ish for individual local development, but is a particularly bad idea in an automated CI system. Rustup itself does not (yet) do any signature verifications for its downloads.

Distros like Debian do not ship the version required by the kernel (v1.62), nor even rustup in some cases, and it's unlikely the distro maintainers will keep the versions in sync with the mainline kernel which likely will become a moving target. Thankfully the Rust project provides standalone installers together with GPG signatures which are very useful for CI.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I see there are all kinds of media servers that look great, but I suspect they are overkill for what I need, and may not actually do what I need.
 Most of my videos are just recorded from the TV, and hence are just randomly named files. So they are not "movies" or anything that would lend itself to a nice "Netflix-like" GUI with cover pictures etc. Rather I just need something where I search for file names.
 I'd like something basic that is similar to MPD.
 Right now, I have the media files (both music and videos) on a samba server. At the TV/stereo, I have an old laptop running linux that is connected to the TV with HDMI and stereo with SPDIF. On that laptop, I run MPD for music, and I like the way it works. I can use various MPD clients to tell the laptop what to play. For example, I can sit in the easy-chair with another laptop and control the music.
 For video though, it is kinda clunky as I don't know a similar app. I can VNC into the laptop, use a file browser to select a video, and launch the desktop player, then backout of VNC. It isn't very practical if you want to fast forward, etc.
 However is there something similar to MPD that would do the videos (or both video and music). So I would envision I sit in the easy-chair with a laptop, and through a browser I could connect to the app on the laptop at the TV, and I could search for media by file name, launch media, control media (fast forward, etc). Just basic.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The backstory about this GitHub Action:
I discussed with an open-source maintainer why they publish npm packages from their local machine and do not use CI/CD pipelines.
They said publishing should require human intervention and want to continue using multi-factor authentication to publish to the npm registry.
This led to building the wait-for-secrets GitHub Action. It prints a URL in the build log and waits for secrets to be entered using a browser. Once entered, the workflow continues, and secrets can be used in future steps.
The latest release of "eslint-plugin-react" to the npm registry used a one-time password (OTP) from a GitHub Actions workflow!

In my view it is a much easier way to find a suitable domain, as the AI thinks of a much large pool of possible names than my own brain. SmartyNames found its own name, using the tool itself.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[ChatGPT是由OpenAI开发的一个人工智能聊天机器人程序，于2022年11月推出。该程序使用基于GPT-3.5架构的大型语言模型并通过强化学习进行训练。目前，有部分地区（例如中国大陆、香港）无法使用此项服务，这里我就介绍一下中国用户如何注册这个服务的方法。


想要注册ChatGPT，首先，需要有一个其他国家的代理服务器或VPN，例如美国，之后，全程使用国外代理服务器或VPN上网，打开ChatGPT的网站（chat.openai.com），点“Sign up”注册，注册后进行邮件验证，这时候就进入了电话号码验证的阶段。


电话号码需要使用一个中国以外的手机号码进行验证，例如美国、印度等国家的手机号码，不支持常见的虚拟号码，例如Google Voice等，可以去一些国外虚拟接码平台来产生号码，例如俄罗斯的接码平台sms-activate，该网站支持中文/英文显示界面，支持支付宝，网站采用俄罗斯卢布货币计费，价格也不算贵。


访问sms-activate，搜索OpenAi，可以找到很多国家的电话号码，其中印度、马来西亚、印尼等国家的电话最便宜，只需要10卢布也就是1元人民币，可以先用支付宝充值0.17美元，也就是1块钱，大概11卢布，之后选择印度、马来西亚、印尼等国的号码都可以，会出现一个虚拟电话号码。


之后将得到的电话号码填入ChatGPT网站，接收短信，然后在sms-activate网站获取短信，填入ChatGPT网站，即可成功注册。


ChatGPT是一个很好的效率工具，可以做为日常工作生活中的一个非常强大的辅助工具。包括搜索、写邮件、写论文、获取知识、头脑风暴等等。


ChatGPT在搜索和写作上非常强大。


我初步用了一下这个工具，简直被其惊呆了。这个模型的人工智能简直远远超出了我的想象，已经难以分辨屏幕背后到底是AI还是真人了。


在搜索上，ChatGPT可以根据用户提供的信息，给出一个非常合理而有效的搜索结果，完全可以当成一个超级智能客服。


在写作上，ChatGPT写的短篇小说，还真是有模有样的，可以秒杀大部分网络作家写的小说。


用来写信，ChatGPT写的信件，内容通畅，用词准确。


如此强大的工具，绝对是个人助理的必备效率神器。]]></summary>

 I'm making this post to ask for feedback on the moderation of /r/linux. When I was added to the mod team there were very strict rules about moderation that I didn't always agree on, but with the removal of the previous mod, most of those got dropped.
 But there are some topics that I still tend to remove even though they get a lot of upvotes (but also a lot of reports) because I personally find them rather boring / repetitive and raise the noise floor on the subreddit.
 But I don't want to make this decision on my own, so I'm asking for your opinion. Those topics are:
  
Screenshots of Linux installations. I find them cool if it shows some exotic / vintage machine, but installing Linux on a new laptop is no achievement, so what's the point? Maybe having a dedicated thread for this would be enough already.
 
In that vein, "Linux Success stories"/Journeys. I find those highly boring and they always give off a cultish vibe. Especially when they come with a long rant on how bad Windows is… 
 
Support questions / discussions. This isn't always so clear cut. There is a dedicated subreddit for Linux support and I think removing those is pretty uncontroversial. But often discussions about what is the best tool for xy also get reported and I'm unsure if this falls under the support umbrella or if it is generally interesting.
 
 Now the question is, should I make those decisions at all. One the one hand Reddit already has an upvote / downvote function, so why not let the users decide? But then we also ban meme posts, because funny posts will get much more upvotes than 'serious' ones and they would quickly drown out all other topics.
 So what do you think?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm interested to know about people's history with linux, how they first heard about it, what distro they started with, what they changed to and why?
 I was given a computer by my university and I guess windows must have been an option, but somehow I wasn't consulted or I missed a deadline, and I got a linux machine. It was running a version of linux that the IT department maintained themselves I think, although I am not 100% sure of that. It was pretty bare bones, as I recall, and at some point I had to enter some sort of information via vim, having never even heard of it! As you can imagine, I had no idea why I couldn't type anything, with the cursor blinking back at me, and then after mashing some keys and something odd happening, I realised I had no idea how to back out. After an embarrassing conversation with the IT department, I decided to learn how to use linux and I went through the whole vim tutorial. I went back to windows ultimately, but after using ubuntu to revive an old laptop I never looked back!

 I've recently got Sony WH-1000XM4 and they sound excellent. On Android all is fantastic, and on my Ubuntu 20.04 when I play audio, it sounds great. All via Bluetooth, not 3.5 mm jack which is also available.
 However, I've fell into a rabbit hole of setting up functional microphone for Ubuntu (again, on Android works perfect). I've switched from PulseAudio to PipeWire, updated BlueZ, and installed Bluetooth Manager from where I can select HSP/HFP profile with mSBC codec. This doesn't totally wreck the audio in headphones, it's tolerable, but it's still significantly worse than when using A2DP Sink profile.
 ​
 Is there any potential to get the same pure sound quality when using HSP/HFP as with A2DP? My understanding is I have to use the former if I want two way communication (mic to work).
 ​
 Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In Search of Us: Adventures in Anthropology, by Lucy Moore, Atlantic Books, February 2023, 320pp

当人类学作为一门学科首次出现在英国高校时，其从业者与他们的研究对象保持着严格的距离。这门学科的维多利亚时代开山鼻祖——牛津大学的爱德华·泰勒爵士和剑桥大学的詹姆斯·弗雷泽爵士的研究仅靠传教士和殖民地管理者从遥远的他乡送回来的民族学材料。弗雷泽的比较宗教学巨著《金枝：巫术与宗教之研究》出了皇皇十二卷，但他去过最远的地方就是意大利了。哈佛大学的心理学先驱威廉·詹姆斯曾问弗雷泽是否真的见过任何“原住民”，他的回答是：“谢天谢地，并没有！”
布罗尼斯拉夫·马林诺夫斯基这位博学多才的潇洒波兰人于1910年加入伦敦政经学院新建的人类学系时，他开的必读书单只有四本书，其中还有两本同名（都叫《人的种族》）。他的第一部专著《澳大利亚原住民家庭》出版于1913年，材料完全来自伦敦的图书馆。

不过变化已经在发生。次年马林诺夫斯基就乘船前往南半球，开始了后来被称为“田野调查”的研究活动——该术语是他的导师阿尔弗雷德·哈登（Alfred Haddon）从自然科学借用的，哈登最初是一名动物学家，在托雷斯海峡群岛研究软体动物，后来将注意力转向当地的人类居民。
作为新生代欧美学者，马林诺夫斯基和哈登在1880年代至1930年代之间对本学科进行了大刀阔斧的改革。他们不再枯坐书斋，开始亲身研究非洲、亚洲和美洲的“原始”文化，与他们的研究对象一起长时间生活，再向西方读者报告他们的发现。
露西·摩尔（Lucy Moore）风格明快的新书《探寻我们》讲述了那一代学者中十二人的故事。该书从法兰兹·鲍亚士（Franz Boas）开始，其职业生涯始于1880年代中期，他在仆人威尔海姆的陪同下，前往巴芬岛与因纽特人生活了一年。他后来成了哥伦比亚大学的教授，并在那里启发了摩尔书中记述的其他几位先驱人物，包括玛格丽特·米德（Margaret Mead）、鲁思·本尼迪克特（Ruth Benedict）和卓拉·尼尔·赫斯顿（Zora Neale Hurston）。该书以1955年克劳德·列维-斯特劳斯在《忧郁的热带》中对人类学之目的与局限的宏伟沉思作为结束。

1880年代中期法兰兹·鲍亚士在巴芬岛与因纽特人共度了一年。


美国作家、人类学家卓拉·尼尔·赫斯顿，摄于1937年。

在这段历程当中，还有一群迷人的学术冒险家。威廉·里弗斯（William Rivers）在爱丁堡附近的克雷格洛克哈特医院首创了对“炮弹休克”（一译弹震症）的科学治疗，他的病人包括罗伯特·格雷夫斯、威尔弗雷德·欧文和齐格弗里德·沙逊。坚定的单身汉爱德华·韦斯特马克是最早以同情的口吻为“同性爱”发声的学者之一，也是婚姻研究的世界级权威。他为了获得“对柏柏尔人更亲密的家庭生活的洞见”，曾经在摩洛哥某户人家的地板下面的洞里藏了一夜。奥黛丽·理查兹（Audrey Richards）是马林诺夫斯基的得意门生，她曾经骑自行车穿越罗得西亚高原，研究殖民统治对本巴族人的影响。她还喜欢在社交出现尴尬时用脚趾点燃火柴来缓和气氛。
摩尔指出，这些彼此之间联系并不紧密的学者的共同点，是他们都对用异国文化来阐明“文明”世界之特殊性感兴趣。正如马林诺夫斯基所说，“在以敬畏的态度真正理解他人——即使是野人——的基本观点后，我们自己的观点也必将得以拓展”。因此，人类学成了一种展示人类共同点的方法，而不是将其分裂。
曾有一位对威廉·里弗斯的知识方法深为景仰的人对“他协调看上去互不相关的事实的可爱天赋”有着特别深刻的印象。同样的话也可以用来赞美摩尔。她告诉我们，与马林诺夫斯基一起抵达特罗布里恩群岛的还有他的二十四箱物资，包括“冲饮柠檬晶、罐装牡蛎和龙虾、各种巧克力和可可、西班牙橄榄、鳕鱼籽、罐装兔肉、蔬菜罐头和菜干、带骨火腿、法国白兰地、茶叶、六种不同的果酱以及大量炼乳”，他还带了近五千粒药片，但只有一把牙刷。
《探寻我们》充满了这样的小插曲，可以说这是一本合传而非人类学著作。摩尔并未美化初代人类学家的偏见、他们对原住民的轻率态度，或人类学本身问题重重的历史。尽管她总结了他们各自的学术观点，这本书的主要亮点还是充分展示了这十几位丰富多彩、突破传统、自由思考的生命。

康昊的新书《神风与铜钱》，正如其副标题所揭示的那样，主要讲述了从1268年蒙元初次入侵日本到1368年元明鼎革之间，“海岛国家”与“世界帝国”之间的冲突、交涉，以及两国和周边东亚各地的历史进程。
近年来，有关蒙元帝国如何影响欧亚大陆各地区政治、经济、文化的话题备受关注。游离于帝国秩序之外的日本，不仅两次抵抗元朝的侵袭，还与大陆王朝之间保持了长期且频繁的贸易往来，无疑构成了蒙元“海洋帝国”方面的重要注脚。本书的讲述重点，正是世称“蒙古袭来”的元日战争以及此后的元日海上贸易、文化交往，前者据传被“神风”所终结，后者则以罕见的巨量铜钱买卖为特征。
一
“神风”之称广为流传，原指1274年、1281年两次“蒙古袭来”时，对元军造成了沉重打击并最终导致元军撤退的暴风雨，由于当时日本全国寺院、神社广泛进行“异国降伏祈祷”，故而时人多将能够击退强大元军归功于神明护佑的“神风”——二战后期，这一历史上的信仰要素又被军国主义者扭曲、利用，成为臭名昭著的自杀攻击语源。不过，始于战争的元日交涉在战后并未终结，以宁波和九州博多为主要节点的元日贸易，反而日益繁荣，甚至推动了东亚海域内诸多地区经济文化交流的持续发展——书中也提到，此后成为“万国津梁”的琉球，正是从此时开始中介东亚海域贸易。
由战争和贸易构成的元日交涉背后，是当时两国各自政治、文化、宗教信仰的持续演变，以及整个东亚海域国际秩序的动荡与转型。对此，葛兆光、村井章介、榎本涉等中日知名学者都有所关注和论述。本书则在前人研究的基础上，结合作者在中世政治、宗教研究等方面的深厚积累与透彻理解，以凝练而生动的笔法，对这一段海岛日本遭遇世界帝国的历史，进行了条理清晰且维度新颖的讲述和解读。

如果你是那些怀念美好的旧式 KDE（3.5）外观的人，那么你可以通过 Trinity 桌面环境（TDE）获得它。TDE 是一个由志愿者组成的小团队开发的一个复刻版的 KDE 3.5 桌面环境。它是 KDE 3 桌面理念的延续，为那些欣赏其功能和设计的人提供了更新和错误修复。

尽管是一个小而独立的项目，TDE 仍然在积极地开发和维护，为用户提供了一个主流桌面环境的替代品。而继 之前的 R14.0.12 版本 之后，第 13 个小版本带来了一些好东西。

Trinity 桌面环境 R14.0.13 的新内容

桌面易用性得到了更新

这个版本引入了使用 Ctrl + 鼠标滚轮 来增加或减少字体大小的功能，这可以用在 Konsole、Kate、KWrite、TDevelop 和其他使用 Kate 嵌入编辑器的应用程序中。此外，Kate 文本编辑器现在包括 Markdown 文件的语法高亮，使其更容易阅读和编辑这些类型的文档。

这些增强功能使用户对文本编辑器的外观有更多的控制，并改善了整体的用户体验。

此外，Trinity 桌面环境 R14.0.13 还改进了用户设置墙纸的方式，使其更容易设置，也更直观。Konqueror 的动作菜单现在提供了设置图像作为背景的各种选项，为用户提供了更多的灵活性和控制力。这些改进提高了设置墙纸时的整体用户体验，使用户更加方便。

除此之外，这个版本还改进了 khotkeys 输入动作，为用户提供了更多的控制和灵活性。它的用于创建和编辑动作的图形用户界面现在包括新的上移/下移按钮，使其更容易重新排列动作。此外，该版本还包括对图形用户界面的修复，以提高其整体可用性和性能。这些改进提高了…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[参数对于交互式计算至关重要，Lua 编程语言提供了 {...} 表达式来封装在启动 Lua 脚本时给定的可变参数。


大多数计算机命令由两部分组成：命令和参数。命令是要执行的程序，而参数可能是命令选项或用户输入。如果没有这种结构，用户将不得不编辑命令的代码，以改变命令所处理的数据。想象一下重写 printf 命令只是为了让你的计算机用 “hello world” 消息问候你。参数对于交互式计算至关重要，Lua 编程语言 提供了 {...} 表达式来封装在启动 Lua 脚本时给定的可变参数。

在 Lua 中使用参数

几乎每一个给计算机的命令都假定一个参数，即使它期望参数是一个空列表。 Lua 会记录启动后写入的内容，即使你可能对这些参数不做任何操作。要在 Lua 启动时使用用户提供的参数，请迭代 {...} 表：

local args = {...}

for i,v in ipairs(args) do
    print(v)
end


运行代码：

$ lua ./myargs.lua
$ lua ./myargs.lua foo --bar baz
foo
--bar
baz
----


参数是不安全的，Lua 会完全按照输入的方式打印所有参数。

解析参数

对于简单的命令，Lua 的基本功能足以解析和处理参数。这是一个简单的例子：

-- setup

local args = {...}

-- engine

function echo(p)
   print(p)
end

-- go

for i,v in ipairs(args) do
  print(i .. ": " .. v)
end

for i,v in ipairs(args) do
  if args == "--say" then
    echo("echo: " .. args[i+1])
  end
end


在 setup 部分，将所有命令参数转储到名为 args 的变量中。

在 engine 部分，创建一个名为 echo 的函数，用于打印你“输入”其中的任何内容。

最后，在 go 部分，解析 args 变量（用户在启动时提供的参数）中的索引和值。在此示例代码中，为清楚起见，第一个 for 循环仅打印每个索引和值。

第二个 for 循环使用索引来检查第一个参数，它被假定是一个选项。此示例代码中唯一有效的选项是 --say。如果循环找到字符串 --say，它会调用 echo 函数，并将当前参数的索引 加 1（下一个 参数）作为函数参数提供。

命令参数的分隔符是一个或多个空格。运行代码查看结果：

$ lua ./echo.lua --say zombie apocalypse
1: --say
2: zombie
3: apocalypse
echo: zombie


大多数用户都知道在向计算机发出命令时空格很重要，因此在这种情况下删除第三个参数是预期的行为。下面是演示两种有效“转义”方法的变体：

$ lua ./echo.lua --say "zombie apocalypse"
1: --say
2: zombie apocalypse
echo: zombie apocalypse

$ lua ./echo.lua --say zombie\ apocalypse
1: --say
2: zombie apocalypse
echo: zombie apocalypse


解析参数

手动解析参数简单且无依赖性。但是，你必须考虑一些细节。大多数现代命令都允许使用短选项（例如，-f）和长选项（--foo），并且大多数命令都提供 -h 或 --help 或者在没有所需参数时显示帮助菜单。

使用 LuaRocks 可以轻松安装其他库。有一些非常好的工具，例如 alt-getopt，它们为解析参数提供了额外的基础设施。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've sent emails to ~ 30 entities since July, and the only 3 respondents were: a 'test' reply from a friend, one business & one .gov.
I setup a PM mail for job applications & the local/name is not offensive or inappropriate. I am sending to businesses & agents with posted job openings, so, it's not unsolicited. I expected a high number of no responses, but > 90% is much higher than I expected(before the latest layoffs trend, anyway).
Is such an address likely to go straight to spam or is there a general dislike for Proton Mail I am not aware of? I understand 'free' emails are often abused by bad actors, but I presumed that Proton Mail would be less maligned than most. Is this an incorrect assumption?

 I have a Xbox one controller I use to game with, but the Bluetooth is kind of flaky. For a while I was using the disable_ertm hack and a cable as a fallback to get around it but it wasn't a perfect solution. Searching online I found that updating the controllers firmware should fix the issue, but as best I understand it can only done be via a Window app.
 In theory you could use qemu to assist here, but when I tried it the controller would change usb hosts repeatedly. In theory you could pass the usb controller over, but that was too much hassle for me, so I grabbed a spare hard drive and install stick.
 The part that really stung was after going through the process of setting up the hardware and os, I also needed to log in with a Live account just to update the firmware (just why?) which then tried to integrate the machine to my account. The number of dark patterns seem to be ever increasing. Only minutes after install and I'm already missing the "user first / no non-sense" approach Linux gives.
 At least in the end the controller now works better with Bluetooth, and seeing pv's progress of wiping Window's fingerprints from existence feels a bit cathartic.

 I currently have a Windows fileserver which is using FreeFileSync to a Linux-based NAS appliance at my house and looking to implement a new fileserver running some flavor of Linux. Also looking remove the old NAS and replace it with the old fileserver.

 If i understand correctly, Trace_printk is a debugging logging function that writes into a ring buffer quite quickly and never blocks. But I am trying to write more than the current size of the buffer
 I found posts saying that you could modify this by modifying /sys/kernel/tracing/buffer_size_kb or /sys/kernel/debug/tracing/buffer_size_kb. But any modification I make doesn't carry over to the next reboot... and most of what I am looking for is happening during boot
 Is there any way to modify these values permanently ?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[近日明星人工智能公司OpenAI发布了全新的聊天机器人模型ChatGPT。该模型能够自动生成代码以及绘画、回答一系列问题、承认自己的错误、质疑不正确的假设，甚至拒绝不合理的要求，且支持中文。


作为OpenAI投资人，马斯克直言：“ChatGPT非常好，我们离强大到危险的AI不远了。”


毫无疑问，ChatGPT又将人们对AI的认知拉到了一个新高度，也令整个市场重新评估AIGC赛道预期。美图公司（01357.HK）今日早间股价一路拉升，涨幅一度高达45.83%，创近一年来新高。而在A股市场上，也有多家上市公司应声跟涨。


ChatGPT可以做什么？


12月5日，OpenAI首席执行官Sam Altman在社交媒体上发文表示，ChatGPT于上周三推出，截至目前已突破100万用户。上一次能引起如此轰动的AI技术是GPT-3发布，如今已经时隔两年。


ChatGPT顾名思义为“聊天 GPT”，其可以对话的方式交互，回答用户所问的问题。这似乎并不新鲜，但情况是，ChatGPT 的智能化远超AI前辈们。


不少用户展示了与ChatGPT对话的有趣内容，并解锁了多个ChatGPT的用途。其中ChatGPT“化身”为程序员帮助开发者解决编码问题。而且，当用户命令 ChatGPT 找出一段程序的bug时，它不仅可以清晰地描述bug及原因，还能自动修复bug，写出一段正确的程序。


此外，作为聊天机器人，ChatGPT可以实现很多其他功能：例如查文档、问百科、写诗、小说。甚至有用户要求撰写一篇关于“AI征服人类”的故事，ChatGPT均可以实现。


业内分析，相比于前辈GPT-3，ChatGPT的主要提升点在于记忆能力。ChatGPT可以储存对话信息，延续上下文，从而实现连续对话，这在对话场景中至关重要，极大地提升了对话交互模式下的用户体验…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Stack Overflow 临时封杀 ChatGPT

OpenAI 的新通用聊天机器人原型 ChatGPT 过去几天风靡互联网，它在解决各种问题上的能力使其可以部分替代谷歌等搜索引擎和 Stack Overflow 等编程问答社区。Stack Overflow 上也涌入了数以千计的用 ChatGPT 回答的问题，但由于 ChatGPT 给出的答案正确性太低，发布的人也缺乏专业性，甚至也不愿意验证正确性，对寻求正确答案的用户来说是有害的。Stack Overflow 因而发表声明，宣布临时封杀 ChatGPT。如果用户被发现使用 ChatGPT 回答问题，他们可能会受到禁止继续发帖的惩罚。


消息来源：Stack Overflow



老王点评：虽然 ChatGPT 能做到一些令人惊讶的对话，但是本质上并不是有效的知识和思考，因此，这些似是而非的回答确实可能会毁了寻求答案者的信任。但是，有个问题是，Stack Overflow 如何识别这些以假乱真的回答？




开源软件托管商 Fosshost 关闭，CEO 失联

非盈利托管商和云计算服务商 Fosshost 免费托管了多个知名的开源项目，其中包括 GNOME、Armbian、Debian 等项目的部分内容，不过，GNOME 和 Debian 的核心基础设施并不依赖 Fosshost。Fosshost 发布了即将下线的公告称，由于情况超出了志愿者的控制，服务器无法保证能继续上线，他们预计将会很快下线。据称下线原因是控制着银行账号和资金的 CEO 已经失联了六个月，以至于无法支付服务器托管费用。


消息来源：Solidot



老王点评：本来很好的开源项目，却由于不良的管理而导致结束。希望有开源基金会或科技企业可以伸出援手。




PyTorch 终于进入 2.0，性能大幅提升

在 2021 年，开发者们对 PyTorch 1.10 是否应该被标记为 2.0 版本进行过简短讨论。当时认为 PyTorch 1.10 与 1.9 相比没有足够的根本性变化，不值得将其升级到 2.0 的主要版本号。但现在，开发者们认为是 PyTorch 2.0 的正确时机，因为该项目引入了一个新模式，称为 torch.compile，大幅提升了速度。经验证，在 2.0 试验版的大约 160 个开源模型上，速度提高了 43%。

Politics and 'Politiques' in Sixteenth-Century France: A Conceptual History, Cambridge University Press, 2021

近年来，政治思想史研究中最令人瞩目的变化无疑是语言学转向。受维特根斯坦、奥斯丁等人的影响，研究者越来越关心在思想的构建过程中，语言所发挥的作用。波考克、斯金纳、基斯·贝克尔（Keith Baker）等人的研究均表明，思想命题的构造、作者之间的交流与对话都依赖于语言。
所谓语言，可以是一套词汇，也可以是一组隐喻，或是某类题材。人们依靠这些语言，从事写作，表达思想，塑造对现实的认识，界定了所身处的状况以及个人在其中的位置。此外，语言本身就是与权力和政治密切相关的要素，既是合法性的表征，也蕴含了人们对情景的理解以及对未来的期待。最后，言说也是一种行动，“文本有多少种语言，就有多少种行动”。对这些语言，尽管当时人很熟悉，后世却已陌生。因此，思想史研究的首要任务便是读懂语言，读懂的前提则是意识到语言有历史维度，因为它代表了“由社会安排、历史事件、公认的价值和它能够言说的思维方式所组成的过去”（Q. Skinner “Meaning and Understanding in the History of Ideas,” History and Theory, Vol. 8, No. 1 [1969], pp. 3-53；波考克，《德行、商业和历史 ： 18世纪政治思想与历史论辑》，冯克利译，三联书店，2012，18-19页）。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[这些有用的开源资源， 提供了采样声音和音乐旋律。


寻找优质的开源音频样本可能是一项挑战。我越来越多地使用开源工具 Ardour 和以创作者为中心的发行版 Ubuntu Studio，利用业余时间创作音乐。我一直在寻找要包含的特定声音或旋律循环的样本。

我熟悉许多查找图像的工具，但直到最近，我才遇到类似的音频资源需求。

开源声音样本

如果你不能自己录制特定的声音，那么寻找特定的声音可能会很困难。有多种资源可用，但在开源许可下提供声音的资源并不多。

Freesound

来看看令人难以置信的宝库 Freesound，这是一个 知识共享 许可的声音协作数据库，你可以在其中浏览、下载甚至贡献。

你几乎可以在 Freesound 上找到任何东西，从路上让人昏昏欲睡的旅游巴士的声音到开门关门的声音或幽灵般的尖叫声。虽然 Freesound 主要侧重于声音样本，但网站上也有一些旋律循环。许多声音都是 CC0 许可的，因此从许可证的角度来看，你可以随心所欲地使用它们。但是，并非所有人都如此，因此在使用任何内容之前请检查许可证，因为你可能需要注明创作者的姓名。

该站点允许你检查采样率、位深度和通道，因此你可以确保该样本适用于你的作品，并且它具有内置评级系统和下载计数。波形显示可让你在预览之前深入了解声音样本的特性。

Freesound 的搜索过滤器不如其他网站强大。声音有时会被分成一组相似的声音，例如 可怕的噪音。这可以帮助你快速获取一堆相似的声音来播放。样本的质量是可变的，因此你可能需要清理某些样本的音频。如果你觉得无聊，甚至可以选择从数据库中随机选择声音，相信我，有些声音非常随机！ Freesound 还有一个社区论坛，你可以参与其中并向他人学习。

NASA 太空声音

如果你正在寻找一些超凡脱俗的声音或想窥探地球与太空之间的对话，NASA 太空声音数据库可能是个不错的去处。探索各种任务的录音并听取来回的通信是很有趣的，其中一些是有旁白的。一些录音包含来自不同太空任务的不同声音，从毅力号漫游者的火星之声到阿波罗任务的音频。

来自 NASA 网站的声音在知识共享类别公共领域标记 1.0 下发布的，这意味着它不受版权法的已知限制。

音乐创作的旋律循环

如果你更关注于创作音乐，你可能正在寻找旋律循环 —— 这是你可以在自己的作品中修改和调整的简短音乐录音。

有各种商业来源的样本包，但 Looperman 上也有很多免版税的旋律循环。音乐家、DJ、制作人和创作者上传了超过 200,000 个旋律循环，从电子舞曲、trap 到古典音乐应有尽有。还有超过 12,000 首无伴奏合唱和口语旋律循环，它是查找低音线或鼓点等内容的绝佳资源。你需要有一个帐户才能下载，并且你必须先下载曲目才能上传任何内容。

Looperman 资源不是知识共享的，但该站点默认采用类似的概念：根据站点许可，“所有样本和旋律循环都可以在商业和非商业项目中免费使用”，但“你不能声明这些旋律循环的版权”。无伴奏合唱和人声样本属于不同的类别，所以检查你考虑使用的任何旋律循环的具体条款是很重要的。

每个旋律循环都会告诉你每分钟的节拍数、调号（如果相关）以及创建它的软件。波形显示旋律循环的特征，让你清楚它是否可能适用于你的项目.你可以在浏览器中预览旋律循环并为创作者留下评论。有一个活跃的社区和许多很棒的资源可以帮助你创建自己的旋律循环。

发挥创意

我希望这可以让你了解在何处可以为你的下一个项目找到音频资源，我期待听到你创建的内容！

It is sometimes called COP (Computer Operating Properly). The way it is implemented is by opening “/dev/watchdog”, then writing at least once a minute. Every time there is a write the restart of the system is delayed.
 In case of inactivity for a minute the watchdog should restart the system. Due to the fact we are not talking about a hardware watchdog the compilation of the operation depends on the state of the machine. You should know that the watchdog implementation could be software only (there are cases in which it won’t restart the machine due to failure) or using a driver/module in case of hardware support (you can read more about it here -…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Yeah basically that.
 I know all about the negatives of snap packages, but are there any real positives for the desktop enduser?
 I mean, there is the auto-update thing but honestly that can be as much a negative as a positive depending on who you ask.
 Flatpacks or appimages have some of the downsides of snaps, but seem to do an overall better job regarding performance for the enduser, and I still prefer to use native packages if possible.
 But snaps seem to have so many disadvantages, so is there a good reason for the enduser to prefer snaps over literally everything else availeable?

What I’m seeking is reading material regarding how to manage project scope, be better team member, converting asks to deliverables, managing expectations from management, enabling team members by opening communication channels across teams, time management, etc.
Any suggested reading material? Preferably books, but excellent blog posts are welcome.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[来自苹果供应商富士康一位消息人士周一表示，预计受新冠肺炎疫情影响的中国郑州工厂将在12月底至明年1月初左右全面恢复生产，此前上个月的工人骚乱扰乱了这个全球最大的iPhone工厂。


路透社报导，位于中国河南省郑州工厂一直在努力应对严格的防疫限制，这些限制引发了工人对工厂条件的不满。 苹果设备的生产在圣诞节和1月的农历新年假期之前中断，许多工人要么不得不隔离以对抗病毒传播，要么逃离工厂。


路透社上个月援引知情人士的话报导称，富士康郑州工厂11月的生产可能有30%以上受到影响。 富士康尚未披露中断对其生产计划或财务的影响的细节。


分析师表示，富士康组装了大约70%的iPhone，郑州工厂生产大部分高端机型，包括 最新的iPhone 14 Pro。


直接了解此事的人士表示，随著新员工的招聘正在进行，“产能正在逐步恢复”。 由于信息是私人信息，该人士拒绝透露姓名。


该人士表示，“如果招聘顺利，可能需要3到4周左右才能恢复全面生产”，指的是12月下旬至1月初左右的时间。


消息人士称，富士康和当地政府正在努力开展招聘工作，但仍存在许多不确定因素。该人士说：“我们正在为招聘开足马力。”


另一位熟悉此事的富士康消息人士表示，该公司希望“尽快”恢复全面生产，但无法给出时间表。


该人士表示，“情况已经稳定下来”，指的是抗议活动和政府放松对防疫的限制。“当地政府正在积极帮助恢复。”


富士康计划在周一收市后，公布11月份的收入。这家台湾公司上个月表示，预计其包括智能手机在内的智能消费电子业务第4季度收入同比略有下降，而云和网络产品的收入将大幅增长。


苹果筹划把部分生产迁出中国


另据美国《华尔街日报》报导，据参与相关讨论的人士称，最近几周苹果公司加快推动把部分生产迁出中国的计划。


这些人士称，苹果告知供应商要更积极地筹划在亚洲其他地方，特别是在印度和越南组装该公司产品，而且苹果也在设法减少对以富士康科技集团为首的台湾组装商的依赖。


苹果目前是全球市值最高的公司，长期以来中国一直在该公司供应链中占主导地位。


报导指，苹果的这种转变部分归因于一个被称为“iPhone之城”的地方发生的动荡。在位于中国郑州的这个巨大的城中之城里，有多达30万人在富士康经营的工厂工作，生产iPhone和苹果其它产品。


据市场研究机构Counterpoint Research的资讯，该工厂一度占到iPhone Pro系列产品产量的约85%。


分析师和苹果供应链上的人士表示，一年来一连串的事件削弱中国作为稳定制造中心的地位，在这些事件发生后，这一变化意味著苹果不再愿意将如此多的业务捆绑在一个地方。


报导指，苹果计划把印度厂的iPhone产量占比从现在的个位数提升至45%，并扩大在越南生产Mac系列电脑、Apple Watch和AirPods系列产品。

粒子物理学家使用所有科学中最长的一些方程式。他们绘制了数以千计的称为费曼图的图片，每张图都编码了一个可能有数百万个术语的复杂公式。这些公式复杂到甚至用计算机添加它们也是一个挑战。33 年来，一个名为 FORM 的程序成为处理这些计算的主要程序。然而，它的维护主要依靠原作者 Vermaseren 一个人，而他已经 73 岁了，但还没有人接手这些工作。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[郑戈（章静绘）

理查德·波斯纳（Richard Posner）是美国当代法学界的传奇人物，长期被视作“天才”的他集法官、学者与公共知识分子三者于一身，以产量惊人的著述产生了巨大的社会影响。上海交通大学凯原法学院的郑戈教授主要研究领域为中国宪法、比较宪法、政治思想史和法理学，也长期关注法和经济学领域，译有大量西方法学名著，如《法律的道德性》《公法的变迁》和《普通法》等。他翻译的传记《波斯纳》（中国民主法制出版社，2022年8月版）已于近日问世。在接受《上海书评》专访时，他对波斯纳思想形成的关键与学说风格的由来做了深入评说。

《波斯纳》书影

能否请您谈谈翻译《波斯纳》的缘起？
郑戈：翻译《波斯纳》的原因其实很简单。我一直关注法和经济学这个领域，对相关的脉络、传统之类都比较熟悉，而只要对法和经济学感兴趣，就不可能绕开波斯纳，特别是他1973年出版的《法律的经济分析》（Economic Analysis of Law），可以说是这一领域的奠基性著作。我还在北大法学院读研究生的时候，就开始对法和经济学感兴趣，之前也译过两本法和经济学领域的著作，一本是斯坦福大学教授米切尔·波林斯基（Mitchell Polinsky）的《法和经济学导论》（An Introduction to Law and Economics），另一本是耶鲁大学教授圭多·卡拉布雷西（Guido Calabresi）的《法和经济学的未来》（The Future of Law and Economics:Essays in Reform and Recollection）——卡拉布雷西和波斯纳一样，也是法和经济学这个领域的开山鼻祖。所以，出版社编辑找到我，问我愿不愿意翻译《波斯纳》，我很爽快地就答应下来了。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[想在 Arch Linux 上试试 Unity 吗？现在可以了！




Unity Desktop 是由 Canonical 构建的经典桌面环境，它从 2010 年到 2017 年是 Ubuntu 的一部分，但为了支持 GNOME 而放弃。

我们认为它永远被杀死了。但它卷土重来。

今年早些时候，自 2016 年 5 月上次更新以来，经过长达 6 年的时间，Unity 的改进版本发布了。

开发由一位年轻的开发人员 Rudra Saraswat 带头，他也是 Ubuntu Unity 的创建者，它现在是 Ubuntu 的官方版本。

Unity 7.6 的发布标志着大量改进的到来。

而且，更进一步，Unity 7.6 已可用于 Arch Linux。开发者提到：


此移植基于 chenxiaolong （于 2011-2016 年维护）的早期成果 Unity-for-Arch。


在 Arch Linux 上试用 Unity 7.6



首先，你必须确保你已经安装了 Arch Linux。

然后你可以按照以下步骤在 Arch Linux 上运行 Unity 7.6：

安装 Paru，它是一个 AUR 助手。

使用 paru -S unity-installer-arch 安装名为 unity-installer-arch 的脚本。

在 TTY/终端窗口中运行 unity-installer-arch。

选择 “安装 Unity 桌面Install Unity desktop”。

将默认显示管理器更改为 lightdm。

使用 unity-greeter 作为默认登录界面。

我的同事 Sreenath 尝试了一下，在安装过程中，由于多重依赖冲突，他不得不从全新的 Arch 开始。

对你来说可能有所不同，但请记住这一点。如果你不想花时间在这上面，你可能想试试 Ubuntu Unity。

总结

对于 Unity 桌面爱好者来说，这是一件好事。更多发行版可能会考虑使用带有 Unity 桌面的变体。

你想让那发生吗？

💬 你是 Unity 桌面的用户吗？想试试看么？在评论区分享你的观点。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[再一次，微软因其 Office 365 的隐私问题而在德国受到抨击！




最近，我偶然看到 Tutanota 的一篇博文，说微软的 Office 365 再次被宣布在德国学校使用是非法的。

好吧，真让人吃惊！😬

上一次发生这种情况还是在 2019 年，当时 Office 365 被禁止在德国黑森州Hesse的学校使用。

补充说明一下，Office 365 软件包提供了一套完善的专有工具，被全球许多专业人士使用，这就是它受欢迎的原因。

然而，正如德国当局指出的那样，它带来了相当多的隐私问题，这些问题还没有得到解决。

🛑 因此，德国数据保护会议（DSK、Datenschutzkonferenz）决定禁止在全国的学校使用微软 Office 365。


💡 DSK 是一个由独立的德国联邦和州数据保护监督机构组成的团体。


微软 Office 365 不能在德国学校使用

一个大胆的举动： DSK 已经禁止在学校使用微软 Office 365，理由是微软存在各种隐私侵犯的行为。

过去两年一直在进行谈判，以确保其符合欧洲数据保护标准。

然而，事情的结果并不理想。

在 DSK 的一份声明中，他们提到：


控制者必须能够根据 GDPR 第 5(2) 条履行其责任义务。在使用微软 365 时，根据“数据保护附录”，在这方面仍然会遇到困难，因为微软没有完全披露具体发生了哪些处理操作。

此外，微软没有完全披露哪些处理操作是代表客户进行的，哪些是为自己的目的进行的。


换句话说，他们觉得微软没有遵守 GDPR 的规定，而且微软一直缺乏透明度。

与 2019 年那次有什么不同？： 好吧，在被黑森州的学校取缔后，微软在 2019 年后做了一些改变。

但是，他们只是采用了欧盟委员会的一些标准合同条款，并更新了他们的《产品和服务数据保护 附录》，几乎只是表面功夫。

这次又是什么原因造成的？： 当 DSK 发现使用 Office 365 时，个人数据被发送到美国，使美国当局可以获得这些数据时，他们很不高兴。

他们还发现，如果不将个人数据传输到美国，就无法使用微软 Office 365。

因此，他们也建议私人用户不要使用 Office 365，因为不能信任微软对他们的数据的处理。

Tutanota 的人还指出，许多贸易学校使用 Office 365 来让他们的学生学习办公室工作。现在，他们将不得不使用微软 Office 的本地许可证（在本地部署）来实现同样的目的。

下一步是什么？ 在最近的一份 声明 中，微软表示，他们不同意 DSK 的做法，并已采取措施，确保他们的 Office 365 产品符合欧洲数据标准，或者经常超过这些标准。

微软提到：


我们谨记 DSK 关于提高透明度的呼吁。虽然我们的透明度标准已经超过了我们行业中的大多数其他供应商，但我们承诺会做得更好。

特别是，我们将在我们计划的欧盟数据限制的框架内，在透明度的意义上提供关于我们客户的数据流和处理目的的进一步文档。

我们还将增加欧盟以外的分包商和微软员工的地点和处理的透明度。


因此，总结一下。在遵守严格的欧盟数据处理准则方面，微软还有很长的路要走。

我认为德国学校应该改用 Linux，并选择开源的微软 Office 替代品，如 LibreOffice、Calligra、ONLYOFFICE 等等，以保证他们的数据安全并掌握在正确的人手中。

你怎么看？微软是否在努力保持其在德国的地位？欢迎分享你的想法。

 As a total amateur when it comes to kernel design, reading pages upon pages of text doesn't seem to really transmit understanding of how it all works together. So I'm posting this to see if other folks have seen helpful diagrams.
 Ideally, this would be a complete logical diagram which would include all the various bits and pieces and how they all mutually interact in the real world. This could be logical relationships, or actual movement of bits here and there.
 A more limited diagram of just a subsystem would also be super helpful, such as the networking stack.
 i.e. How the link layer (ARP, RARP, NDP) interacts with the transport layer (TCP/UDP), how that interacts with the application layer (BGP, DNS, LDAP), etc...

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In almost all of science fiction, we see characters interacting with computers via voice, from pop culture heavyweights like Star Trek, JARVIS from Ironman, Knight Rider, etc to niche cartoons like Jonny Quest, Centurions, etc.
 Now we have some of that on mobile devices like Alexa, Siri and Hey Google. However, they are controlled by megacorps and those corps keep it limited to their services or even phase out functionality, if it doesn't benefit them monetarily.
 Even Windows can do it using Cortana but as a Linux Mint user, I've been waiting forever for a reliable way to interact with my PC using my voice, I've tried Mycroft on a Raspberry Pi but it was really bad.
 I'd love to have a way to ask my computer about the weather, add notes, tasks and meetings to my favorite applications without using Google or Amazon.
 Why haven't we seen a push for that? Am I missing something or is that impossible to do reliably without access to a cloud based trove of user data?
 Edit: Also voice based dictation? Even if you think voice control is stupid, you can't deny dictation is useful.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I was trying out linux vm. I primarily use windows. In windows there is already a gui but I don't understand how it works in linux. 
 Q1: What is all this server-client in linux desktop environment?
 Q2: What's difference between Xorg, X11, Plasma, Gnome & Wayland?
 In windows a application made for windows simply works on windows.
 Q3: Can a application developed in fedora work on ubuntu? Why or Why not? Both are linux right?
 Q4: Can a application developed for kde work on gnome?
 PS: Please don't mind my ignorance, I am new to linux & it is really confusing for me.

 Thats basically my entire youth in a time capsule that i completely forgot i had.
 I have redundant backups of that time capsule now and while Celluloid does a great job of playing them .. i'm kinda looking for more of a .. "music collection manager" similar to Spotify.
  
I remember sending all those mp3 through a "detect music and mp3tag them automatically" like 15 or 20 years ago. We all know how much more advanced AI is nowadays and i wanna do it again.
 Most of those are from random sources where i downloaded backup copies of CDs i already owned ( like eMule and Kazaa ). So the naming conventions are all over the place.
 
I would like to listen to suggested "daily mixes" similar to Spotify based on my music collection.
 
I would like to listen to a selection of web radio stations that are similar to what i listen to and have in my music collection.
 
 I don't have any idea whats happening in the music player "market" right now, because i usually just listen to a playlist i have on YouTube on random ( and get angry because the random function on YT fucking sucks )
 All suggestions are appreciated.
 EDIT : Forgot to mention im on Solus Budgie. Please let this not deter you from suggesting things from other DE's.

根据 Valve 公布的 2022 年 11 月操作系统市场份额统计，Linux 的份额在过去一个月出现数年以来的最大份额：1.44%。Windows 仍然是统治地位的 96.11%。Linux 的份额长期以来一直在 1.2% 左右，过去一年增加了 0.28%。这一涨幅被认为主要是 Linux 掌机 Steam Deck 带来的一百多万用户，SteamOS 用户约占其中的 1/4。十年前，当 Steam 在 Linux 上首次亮相时，它享有大约 2% 的市场份额，但那时的 Steam 用户数显然比现在少得多。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Authy 是一款流行的应用，用于存储和管理双因素代码。它是一项基于云的服务，可为你提供便利的工业级安全性。不幸的是，它不是开源的。

你会考虑在 Linux 桌面上使用更直接（和开源）的身份验证器应用吗？

嗯，当然，你不能使用云同步。但是你可以为双因素身份验证码做个备份。记住这点，让我告诉你更多有关 Authenticator 的信息。



Authenticator：生成双因素身份验证代码

当你启用在线服务的双因素身份验证时，大多数服务都会为你提供令牌/QR 码，你可以添加/扫描以生成代码。

Authenticator 就是这样一款适用于 Linux 的应用，他可让你添加双因素身份验证码。



它是一个自由开源的应用，具有添加各种支持双因素身份验证的令牌和网站的基本功能。

身份验证器的特点



你获得的一些基本功能包括：


使用相机或截图的二维码扫描器

使用密码保护应用

自动锁定应用

支持各种算法（SHA-1/SHA-256/SHA-512）

支持基于时间/基于计数器/流式计算方法

备份/恢复选项（FreeOTP、Aegis 和 OTP、Bitwarden 和 Google Authenticator）


你可以设置自定义选项，并能够根据服务提供的支持添加自定义的提供者。可以为提供者添加自定义图标，以帮助你区分身份验证代码。



在大多数情况下，默认设置应该适用于网站。但是，如果它不起作用，你可能需要与提供者核实确切的详细信息。

该应用还具有开箱即用的多个提供者，例如 Google Drive 和 Proton Mail。因此，你无需为添加的每个条目添加自定义配置。

在 Linux 上安装 Authenticator



Authenticator 以 Flatpak 的形式提供。因此，你可以将它安装在任何 Linux 发行版上。

只需输入以下命令即可安装它：

flatpak install flathub com.belmoussaoui.Authenticator


你可以前往其 Flathub 或 GitLab 页面探索更多信息。

如果你是 Linux 世界的新手，请参阅我们的 Flatpak 指南 进行设置。你的软件中心可能已经启用了 Flatpak 集成。这种情况下，你可以搜索安装它。

使用开源身份验证器应用确保安全性和可靠性

我们经常依赖云驱动的工具来处理所有事情。当然，这很方便。

但是，有时桌面应用更有用。如果你也这么想并考虑进行转换，Authenticator 可能是一款值得安装的出色的应用，可以用于双因素身份验证码。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[《为历史而战》，[法]吕西安·费弗尔著，高煜译，译林出版社2022年6月出版，511页，98.00元

“在（20世纪）50年代，批评是一项工作。阅读、讨论一本书，是一项人们为自身、为自身利益，也是改变自身的活动。”福柯在1984年去世前的一次访谈中如是说（Foucault, “Pour en finir avec les mensonges”）。批评是一项严肃的工作，是在与他人的对话中为了自身的活动。这时，福柯批评过法国史学中的总体史等。那么，作为二十世纪五十年代学术批评的一部分，法国的史学批评又是何种情形？二十世纪上半叶，批评又是如何塑造了现代历史学的原则？
这些问题在法国史学家费弗尔（Lucien Febvre）的《为历史而战》中得到了部分的回答。作者自编的这部文集主要汇编了1920年至1952年发表在《年鉴》和《历史综合评论》上的四十多篇文章，分“开宗明义”“赞成与反对”“关注近邻或兄弟学科”“最后的期望”等六大部分，围绕“应如何研究历史”这一问题展开一系列的探讨。回溯起来，这一问题及其部分答案也见于他的专著，例如《弗朗什-孔泰》（1905）、《菲利普二世与弗朗什-孔泰》（博士论文；1911）、《大地与人类的演进》（1922）、《马丁·路德的时运》（1928）、《莱茵河》（1935）、《16世纪的不信教问题》（1942）、《论〈七日谈〉：圣爱、俗爱》（1944）、《米什莱（1798-1874）》（1946）。不同于专著和专题论文，《为历史而战》中的那些评论被费弗尔看作是“历史学实验室”，一个揭示历史学迅速发展、批评“一些错误的思考和研究历史的方法”、展现自我主张、“为那些比较年轻的同行提供一些便利”的实验室（467、465、第1页）。该书产生了很大的影响。《泰晤士报文学增刊》于1995年10月6日公布了二战后影响西方公共话语的一百本书，其中就包括了《为历史而战》。

The one thing we all had in common is having nvidia drivers installed. I was immediately able to remove the oracle kernel, but apt got into a loop when trying to remove the other extra kernel, lowlatency, installing the unsigned version if I removed the signed version, and then installing the signed when I removed the unsigned -- the fix for that, if you've had this happen, is to first remove the nvidia signed module for lowlatency before removing the lowlatency kernel.

为何使用 PowerShell

PowerShell，正如它的名字那样，是一个强大的工具。它的句法冗长，但语义清晰。对那些不愿意写长命令的开发者来说，PowerShell 的大多数命令都有别名。可以使用 Get-Alias 或点击 此处 查询别名的使用方法。

PowerShell 和传统的 Shell 最大的区别在于它的输出管道。普通的 Shell 输出的是字符串或字符流，PowerShell 输出的是对象。这对命令管道的工作方式具有深远的影响，而且它具有很多的优点。

演示例子

下面的例子体现的是冗长而清晰的特点。以 # 号开头的行是注释行。以 PS > 开头的行是命令行，PS > 是提示符：

# Return all files greater than 50MB in the current directory.
## Longest form
PS > Get-Childitem | Where-Object Length -gt 50MB
## Shortest form (with use of aliases)
PS > gci | ? Length -gt 40MB
## Output looks like this

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[《周书》修订本，中华书局，2022年11月版

马克思在《黑格尔法哲学批判导论》中说：
宗教里的苦难既是现实苦难的表现，同时又是对这种现实苦难的抗议。宗教是被压迫生灵的叹息，是没有人性世界中的人性，是没有灵魂处境里的灵魂。它是人民的鸦片。
正因如此，前现代社会中最能与皇权分庭抗衡者，非宗教莫属。由此，政教之间产生无数纠葛斗争。中国历史上佛教曾经历“三武一宗之厄”，盖指北魏太武帝、北周武帝、唐武宗、后周世宗四次法难。周武法难是其中最为特殊的。
隋唐被目为中国历史上的一大盛世，这一时期亦被称为中国佛教的黄金时代。而这一佛教黄金时代的到来，是以一次灭佛运动作为开端的：周武法难。
（建德三年【574】五月）丙子，初断佛道二教，经像悉毁，罢沙门道士，并令还民，并禁诸淫祀，礼典所不载者，尽除之。（《周书·武帝纪》）
建德六年（577）周武帝平定北齐，齐境也随即断教。这一场起自关西，席卷整个北中国的灭法活动，随着宣政元年（578）周武帝北伐突厥途中病逝而稍歇。其子宣帝（天元皇帝）“初复佛像与天尊像”又建立了颇为奇特的以在家样貌而行出家事为国行道的“菩萨僧”制度。而在大象二年（580）宣帝去世十一天后，在权臣杨坚主导下，静帝下诏正式废除了禁毁佛、道二教的政策。这场灭法活动，对佛教产生了巨大的破坏，隋开皇十七年（597），经历了周武法难的费长房略带夸张地回顾道：
毁破前代关山西东数百年来官私所造一切佛塔，扫地悉尽，融刮圣容，焚烧经典。八州寺庙，出四十千，尽赐王公，充为第宅。三方释子，减三百万，皆复军民，还归编户。（《历代三宝纪》卷十一）
这一场动荡整个北中国的法难又是如何发生的呢？
西魏北周的佛教
北魏孝文帝南迁以来，一时人文尽在洛阳，以长安为中心的关陇地域颇为沉寂。东西分裂后，洛阳的文化大体被东魏接收。故而西魏北周一直以保守、刚健质朴的风貌出现在史书中，无论是苏绰的《六条诏书》还是恢复《周…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have a buddy of mine who needs an upgrade. He's still running Windows 7. His family doesn't want to upgrade ( Members of the cult of Windows 7) but I can't in good conscience continue to let this man use window 7, Especially with his bank account, with its wild security vulnerabilities. I'm considering upgrading the man to a Linux system, but he has little to no computing experience. He refers to himself as "The troglodyte" and is mostly not that interested in learning. 
 Another issue is that this machine will be shared with his family, and his mother in particular is a MASSIVE Conspiracy Theorist. On 1 hand, that helps limit the damage she can do with viruses. (She infects the thing about once a week visiting who knows what conspiracy sites. I'm amazed the thing still functions) On the other, I shudder to think what this woman can do with the power of The terminal. One "Do you want to stop the intergalactic lizard space aliens from being able to read your mind? Simply input this into your terminal!" could wreck the entire system. With no recourse beyond a full reinstall. 
 Is there any distro, or anything, that I could do/recommend that could possibly help them? Something very beginner friendly. Would it be possible for me to disable the terminal, to minimize the damage that could be done, and still have a usable experience? Before continuing I would be sure to verify it with them. I'm not one of THOSE Linux guys That would swap an entire system's OS without telling them and getting permission. The thing is absolutely ancient and borderline unusable in its current state, So I wouldn't be hurting anything by potentially switching it over. Trying to help the guy out, and weighing my choices. I have rudimentary Linux experience, and would be able to help at the beginning if need be, which I'm sure it would be. That's one advantage I didn't have starting out. Any advice, or is this just too risky of a thing to do?

 I'm hoping this is the best place to post this, if not, please let me know where would be better.
 I was working on a Linux website host server years ago, and my boss hired some people in another country to work overnight. When a freshman couldn't get access to something (that he didn't know he didn't need), he ended up using sudo (not my decision to allow them to do that) to give himself all permissions to all files starting from the root directory.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I ran the linpeas script on my system, out of curiosity, to check for possible PE exploits from my guest accounts. I understood most of what it reported back to me, fixed a couple of permission mistakes. But it also reported alerts on several 'writable listeners'. These were from legit core packages like systemd or nvidia.
 For example the sockets it referenced as Writable were /run/libvirt/libvirt-sock and /run/nvidia-xdriver-1e20223d and a couple of others (jackctl, pcscd,...).
 My question is why is a writable socket that these packages create considered a vulnerability? Should I do something about these? Aren't the sockets supposed to be writable (even by different users) to allow for process communication?

        <link href="https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/zauqxt/linux_outofmemory_killer_oom_killer/"/>
        <updated>2022-12-02T19:15:23.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Linux kernel has a mechanism called “out-of-memory killer” (aka OOM killer) which is used to recover memory on a system. The OOM killer allows killing a single task (called also oom victim) while that task will terminate in a reasonable time and thus free up memory. 
 When OOM killer does its job we can find indications about that by searching the logs (like /var/log/messages and grepping for “Killed”). If you want to configure the “OOM killer” I suggest reading the following link https://www.oracle.com/technical-resources/articles/it-infrastructure/dev-oom-killer.html. 
 It is important to understand that the OOM killer chooses between processes based on the “oom_score”. If you want to see the value for a specific process we can just read “/proc/[PID]/oom_score” - as shown in the screenshot below. If we want to alter the score we can do it using “/proc/[PID]/oom_score_adj” - as shown also in the screenshot below. The valid range is from 0 (never kill) to 1000 (always kill), the lower the value is the lower is the probability the process will be killed. For more information please read https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man5/proc.5.html. 
 In the next post I am going to elaborate about the kernel thread “oom_reaper”. See you in my next post ;-)

 My friend and I started college this year. He is studying physical therapy and I, computer science. I have used Linux (mainly Ubuntu) for a few years on secondary machines (and on my steam deck if you count that). So I have some experience with Linux, but my friend doesn't.
 ​
 So it was our first day of class, and my friend called me and told me that his laptop wasn't working. He had intro assignments due that night and needed to use his computer, as it was his only machine at that point. Well, for whatever reason, the windows install was borked, and he didn't have any important data, so I went to reinstall windows (from a USB stick). When doing this, I kept getting the error that the installer didn't have the right drivers to recognize his SSD. I could have futzed around…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The software-interrupt mechanism is one of the oldest parts in the kernel;
arguably, the basic design behind it predates Linux itself.  Software
interrupts can get in the way of other work so, for almost as
long as they have existed, developers have wished that they
could be made to go away.  That has never happened, though, and doesn't
look imminent. Instead, Android systems have long carried a patch that
tries to minimize the impact of software interrupts, at least in some
situations.  John Stultz is now posting
that work, which contains contributions from a number of authors, in
the hope of getting it into the mainline kernel.]]></summary>

 Here is summary of it's features:
  
Works on Linux, Mac OS X, Windows, FreeBSD and most popular Unix-like systems.
 Outputs beautiful, semantic colors by default.
 Show paths to symlinks, and explicitly show broken links.
 Recurse down sub-directories.
 Emojis (if you're into that) and Nerd Fonts.
 Supports producing structured JSON and CSV output (to use with jq or similar tools). I was inspired by nushell.
 Full flexibility in choosing which columns / information to show.
 Support correct handling of CJK and other wide or invisible Unicode characters in tabular format.
 Better default sorting (by basename then extension) and 8 custom sorting methods (more than ls, although lacking a few of ls sorting methods).
 Support several formats for time, along with custom Unix's time format (all compatible with ls).
 Support several formats for file sizes (all compatible with ls).
 High compatibility with ls command's flags.
 Ability to customize colors with an environment variable.

    图片截取自官方宣传片 The Official Mascot of the FIFA World Cup Qatar 2022™

馄饨皮、饺子皮、小精灵…… 这至少是中文互联网对于 2022 卡塔尔世界杯吉祥物印象。虽然这样说有些戏谑，但至少说明这个吉祥物给大家留下了非常深刻印象。不过只从吉祥物身上看 2022 届卡塔尔世界杯的视觉形象设计或许有些以偏概全了，毕竟除了吉祥物之外，还有 Logo、门票、字体、配色、电视中的视觉组成一个完整的视觉形象。那么本期的持续更新，和大家分享一下 2022 卡塔尔世界杯在吉祥物、字体和 Logo 设计上的巧思和批判。对了，在阅读之前推荐大家去世界杯官网上看一下吉祥物和 Logo 的设计。
馄饨皮：世界杯吉祥物中的少数派，手法独到且有差异性

    开幕式上的「馄饨皮」 图片来源

在微博上看到大家叫它「馄饨皮」之前我并没有真正观察过卡塔尔世界杯的任何设计。实际上，我第一次看到 La'eeb 的时候并不觉得他像馄饨皮，而是更像可爱的幽灵，因为无论是 Emoji、任天堂、万圣节等等活动中，大家都会把白色、无腿、大眼睛这些元素用在幽灵身上。这让我想到，大家认为 La'eeb 像馄饨皮的原因其实是文化差异：我们的生活环境中很少有人带这样的头饰，更没有见过未佩戴在头上的样子，比如我就以为这块布并不是正方形的，而开幕式上 La'eeb 出场的样子是白白净净方方正正，生活中拥有这样特征的就是馄饨皮和饺子皮了。
让我们摆正姿态再认识一下它：La'eeb，拉伊卜，样貌极具辨识度和话题性。它不仅是一个很可爱且吸睛的吉祥物，也是在世界杯中差异性做的最好的吉祥物之一，并且它是组成本次世界杯视觉设计「民族性」的重要一环。让我们先看看他的由来。

谷歌称，“在过去几年/版本中，内存安全漏洞的数量大幅下降。”每年的内存安全漏洞数量从 2019 年的 223 个下降到 2022 年的 85 个。Android 13 是第一个该版本中加入的大部分新代码都是内存安全语言的安卓版本，Rust 在 Android 13 所有新的原生代码中占 21%。在整个 Android 12 和 13 系统中，“在安卓的 Rust 代码中发现的内存安全漏洞为零”。

OpenAI 的新聊天机器人可以解释代码

OpenAI 发布了一个通用的聊天机器人原型 ChatGPT，可以以更像人类的方式和用户对话。虽然这种聊天机器人本质上是 “随机鹦鹉”，它们的知识仅仅来自于训练数据中的统计规律，而不是像人类那样对世界这个复杂而抽象的系统的理解。但有人用编码问题测试了它，并声称其答案是完美的。比如说，它会说“你使用的那个循环条件犯了一个严重的错误！”或者可以让它像一个聪明的黑客一样解释冒泡排序算法。

老王点评：能解释代码其实并不令人意外，要是能进一步可以帮忙审查代码就更好了。




英国年龄超过 50 岁的 IT 专家仅有 22% 

根据英国计算机协会的研究，在当地 190 万 IT 专家中，只有 22%（41.3 万）达到或超过 50 岁，而英国其他就业领域中 50 岁以上的平均人数约为 56.1万。另外，老年技术人员的时薪中位数为 25 英镑，比整个 IT 专家群体的时薪高 14%。

墓志，以及其他类型的石刻，承载着丰富的历史信息，是研究者不可忽视的资料。在西魏北周史研究中，传世文献的稀少使得墓志的价值更加凸显。利用墓志进行研究，首先需要掌握检索方法，了解研究时段内墓志的存佚状况，以免因失检导致研究不尽周详。碑志目录、索引以及石刻数据库能够帮助研究者在较短时间内将所需材料大致搜罗齐备。刘琴丽编《汉魏六朝隋碑志索引》（中国社会科学出版社2019年版）是目前收录唐以前碑志数目最多的石刻检索工具书。据该书统计，截至2017年底，各种出版物中所见西魏碑志共计五十二种，北周碑志共计二百零五种。据笔者不完全统计，2017年以来出版的石刻图录及期刊文章中又见西魏墓志九种、北周墓志二十八种。尽管石刻收藏与考古发现的陆续公布使西魏北周墓志的可知数量继续增长，但与东魏北齐墓志的已知数量相比，西魏北周墓志可以说是少得可怜。这一现象或许不能简单视为“幸存者偏差”，其背后的历史原因有待探寻。好在，可资西魏北周史研究的墓志不仅限于西魏北周纪年墓志。隋代乃至唐贞观以前的墓志，都是西魏北周史研究中需要留意的资料。

自传统金石学至现代石刻研究，学界对墓志的考察不断深入。孙正军总结出近年来中古碑志研究的六个新动向：一是谱系的发现及建构过程之探讨；二是碑志的历史书写与“异刻”研究；三是碑志的个体生命史研究；四是碑志的历史记忆研究；五是碑志的政治景观研究；六是碑志所见地域社会史研究。（孙正军：《近十年来中古碑志研究的新动向》，《史学月刊》2021年第4期。作者在此文中首先提出了一、二、五三个动向。在2022年10月29日由复旦大学历史学系主办的“碑之转身·中古中国石碑与石刻文化学术研讨会”上，作者提交的会议论文以《近年来中古碑志研究的新动向》为题，文中提出三、四两个新动向。第六个新动向乃笔者亲承赐示，在此…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[多文本交织的个体生命史
近年来以碑志为主要资料的个体生命史研究，多关注“边缘人”的历史。这些“边缘人”在传世文献中籍籍无名，出土材料有助于还原他们的生平，使后人得以了解以往不为人知的人生。然而，包括墓志在内，中国古代关于个人生平的资料，几乎都是基于个人在政治体中的地位和作用形成的。政治体内部的中心与边缘，是多重而相对的，上至皇帝下至奴隶，所有人的生命历程都被打碎，融入线性的历史叙事中，个体生命沦为历史事件的注脚，每个人都难免在历史文本中沦为边缘人（例如皇帝作为储君时的经历，一般不会详细保留在本纪中，因为本纪中的皇帝是在位年代的代名词）。整合零散的文本，还原被政治身份定义、被政治时间打碎的人生，在以个人生活为中心的叙事框架中重新发现历史细节，以及从前未曾引人注目的联系，或许有助于让个体生命史研究获得超越个案积累的意义。以下试以元罗为例，还原在文本边缘游走的人生。
元罗是北魏江阳王元继次子，亦即孝明帝朝权臣元叉之弟。其人一生转仕北魏、西魏、萧梁、侯景与北周，事迹散见魏、梁、周、齐诸书，南、北二史甚至《隋书》。南北朝后期政局变动频繁，转投他国避难者不在少数，但未有如元罗一样能在五个政权保持名位不堕的人。元罗的行迹决定其生平资料的多源性，史料的多源反过来又使得后世对元罗的了解呈现为零星的碎片。填补诸家史籍的叙事缝隙，描绘元罗相对完整的人生图景，本就是有价值的史学工作。然而，囿于集团、群体研究的偏好，现代学者多将元罗视作入梁元魏皇族的一员（综述见张宇阳：《入梁之元魏皇族研究》，扬州大学硕士学位论文，2017年），或将其经历作为北周优待元魏宗室的例证（王永平：《北朝后期元魏皇族人物之境遇》，《社会科学战线》2017年第8期），未将其生平作为个案进行研究。笔者认为，萧梁不可能对来奔的元魏宗室秉持一视同仁的政策，北周亦不会优容所有拓跋家人，而是根据他们各自的利用价值与威胁程度区别对待。去除…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Git 的 bisect 工具通过快速识别坏的提交，节省了时间和精力。


你是不是有过这样的经历：发现代码中有 错误bug，但不知道这个错误是什么时候引入的。这有可能是因为，某个人提交了一份有错误的代码，但没有在他的 Git 提交commit 消息中声明它。这个错误可能已经存在了几周、几个月甚至几年，这意味着你需要搜索数百或数千个提交，才能找到问题何时出现的。而 git bisect 命令能够完美地解决这个问题！

git bisect 命令是一个强大的工具。你可以给 git bisect 命令一个范围，一端是一个已知的好状态，另一端是一个已知的坏状态。它会自动地确认当前范围的中点，在这个中点上进行测试，然后要求你确定那次提交是一个 好提交good commit 还是一个 坏提交bad commit，然后它会重复这一“二分查找”的过程，直到你找到首次引入错误的那一次提交。



这个“数学”工具是利用“二分查找”来找到错误之处的。git bisect 命令通过查看中点，然后由你来决定它是提交列表的新起点（即 “坏提交” ）还是新终点（即 “好提交”），进而来缩小查找范围，如此在几次查找中你可以就能定位到有错误的提交。即使你有 10,000 个提交要检查，最多只需要 13 次查找，就能很快地定位到首次引入错误的提交。


提交 1 坏 <> 提交 10,000 好 => 提交 5,000 是坏的

提交 5,000 坏 <> 提交 10,000 好 => 提交 7,500 是好的

提交 5,000 坏 <> 提交 7,500 好 => 提交 6,250 是好的

提交 5,000 坏 <> 提交 6,250 好 => 提交 5,625 是坏的

提交 5,625 坏 <> 提交 6,250 好 => 提交 5,938 是坏的

提交 5,938 坏 <> 提交 6,250 好 => 提交 6,094 是好的

提交 5,938 坏 <> 提交 6,094 好 => 提交 6,016 是坏的

提交 6,016 坏 <> 提交 6,094 好 => 提交 6,055 是好的

提交 6,016 坏 <> 提交 6,055 好 => 提交 6,036 是坏的

提交 6,036 坏 <> 提交 6,055 好 => 提交 6,046 是坏的

提交 6,046 坏 <> 提交 6,055 好 => 提交 6,050 是坏的

提交 6,050 坏 <> 提交 6,055 好 => 提交 6,053 是好的

提交 6,053 坏 <> 提交 6,055 好 => 提交 6,054 是好的


对于上面这个例子，我们能知道 10,000 个提交中的第一个错误提交是第 6053 次提交。对于 git bisect 命令，最多需要几分钟就能完成检索。但是如果要一个一个查找每个提交是否错误，我甚至无法想象需要多长时间。

使用 Git bisect 命令

git bisect 命令使用起来非常简单：

（LCTT 译注：使用 git bisect start 命令来进入 bisect 模式，并且该命令指定了一个检查范围。它会告诉我们一共有多少次提交，大概需要几步就可以定位到具体的提交。）

$ git bisect start
$ git bisect bad        # Git assumes you mean HEAD by default
$ git bisect good <ref> # specify a tag or commit ID for <ref>


Git 检查中间的提交，并等待你声明这次提交是一个好提交还是一个坏提交：

（LCTT 译注：如果某一提交是可以通过的，则使用 git bisect good 命令标记；同样地，如果某一提交不能通过，则使用 git bisect bad 命令标记。）

$ git bisect good


或

$ git bisect bad


然后，git bisect 工具重复检查好提交和坏提交中间的那次提交，直到你告诉它：

$ git bisect reset


一些高级用户甚至可以自己编写脚本，来确定提交的好坏状态、并在找到特定提交时采取某一补救措施。你可能不会每天都使用 git bisect 命令，但当你需要它来定位首次引入错误的提交时，它会是一个很有用的救星。

As the amount of new memory-unsafe code entering Android has decreased, so too has the number of memory safety vulnerabilities. From 2019 to 2022 it has dropped from 76% down to 35% of Android’s total vulnerabilities. 2022 is the first year where memory safety vulnerabilities do not represent a majority of Android’s vulnerabilities. 

While correlation doesn’t necessarily mean causation, it’s interesting to note that the percent of vulnerabilities caused by memory safety issues seems to correlate rather closely with the development language that’s used for new code. This matches the expectations published in our blog post 2 years ago about the age of memory safety vulnerabilities and why our focus should be on new code, not rewriting existing components. Of course there may be other contributing factors or alternative explanations. However, the shift is a major departure from industry-wide trends that have persisted for more than a decade (and likely longer) despite substantial investments in improvements to memory unsafe languages.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have an mdadm RAID1 array at my parents that consisted of 4x2TB disks
 2 of these disks died and I don't intend to replace them, so I want to scale down the array to 2x2TB disks
 I removed both devices from the mdadm array, but I'm still seeing this when I run mdadm --detail /dev/md0
 I just can't seem to find a way to remove the "disk" with a "removed" state
 root@parents-server:/mnt# mdadm --detail /dev/md0 /dev/md0: Version : 1.2 Creation Time : Wed Jul 20 22:22:27 2022 Raid Level : raid1 Array Size : 1953382400 (1862.89 GiB 2000.26 GB) Used Dev Size : 1953382400 (1862.89 GiB 2000.26 GB) Raid Devices : 3 Total Devices : 2 Persistence : Superblock is persistent Intent Bitmap : Internal Update Time : Thu Dec 1 22:28:50 2022 State : clean, degraded Active Devices : 2 Working Devices : 2 Failed Devices : 0 Spare Devices : 0 Consistency Policy : bitmap Name : parents-server:0 (local to host parents-server) UUID : 64c7435f:85a7e90d:25c09e71:0f128cbe Events : 182112 Number Major Minor RaidDevice State - 0 0 0 removed 1 8 49 1 active sync /dev/sdd1 2 8 65 2 active sync /dev/sde1 
 
 EDIT: Fixed it
 https://serverfault.com/questions/554553/how-to-delete-removed-devices-from-a-mdadm-raid1
 mdadm --grow /dev/md1 --raid-devices=3 
 So in my case it was
 mdadm --grow /dev/md0 --raid-devices=2 
 Even though it's not "growing" it still set it to 2 disks

Think of Nihongo Lessons as the textbook to Nihongo’s dictionary. It’s an app for learning Japanese, specifically made for learners who are serious about becoming fluent, and want a guided set of content that will help them efficiently acquire vocabulary and grammar.
The project came about when Adam Shapiro of Japanese Level Up (Jalup) [1] announced last April that he was shutting Jalup down. As a fan of Adam’s work I was bummed to hear the news, but realized I actually might be one of the few people in the world in a position to keep his work alive. So I reached out, and we came up with a deal where I would sell Jalup content in …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have become very interested in this lately as I recently went through hell with my computer breaking and having to start over. For newbs and intermediate users, what are some common things we should get in the habit of doing to maintain the overall health of our systems? things beyond the usual autoremove, autopurge, update, upgrade, blah blah. Even delving into security and networking to ensure max performance and safety. Or how to find errors/bugs/misconfigured files/ or even files that need to be configured. I just want to make sure my system is running smoothly, safely, and correctly at all times. I recently did a systemd-analyze security check and the results freaked me out lol but that whole side of Linux is a bit confusing for me lol any tips would be appreciated

 I'm running Mint Jammy btw

据悉，腾讯游戏管家由腾讯网游加速器升级而来，是一款免费游戏加速管理工具，包括支持《王者荣耀》、《绝地求生》等热门游戏，可以提高游戏的稳定性和安全性。


另外，由于平台运营策略调整，结合整体运营情况考虑，迅雷网游加速器宣布于2022年12月1日停运，关停加速服务和各类活动。


据介绍，腾讯网游加速器是腾讯出品的游戏加速器软件，可以针对旗下网络游戏和国内外市面上火热的网络游戏进行加速，降低游戏延迟，减少卡顿。通常玩家玩外服游戏时，会选择使用加速器改善网络质量。


据了解，去年腾讯加速器曾经发布公告显示，因腾讯加速器产品策略调整，暂不接受新增充值。

We've built startups (Ryan was Dir. of Engineering at N26) and worked in big tech (William was SRE at Spotify), and in every company, saw the same pattern of data spreading out of control. It felt like a dirty secret: hundreds of employees are granted access to customer PII through internal systems. Engineers responsible for securing data end up in a race against a growing list of SaaS or internal tools in use across the organization, and fall back to using bad access management workflows.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[在蒂姆·库克说苹果将从TMSC的亚利桑那州工厂采购芯片后，一份新的报告对它将开始使用什么工艺以及最初的生产量有了更多的了解。在最初说它将在亚利桑那州开始生产5纳米工艺的芯片后，该公司显然改变了主意。当第一家工厂在现在看来是2024年全面开工时，它将生产4纳米芯片。到那时，台积电的主要代工厂预计将达到3纳米。


而且，一份新报告称，该厂约三分之一的产能将用于苹果。据说该厂之前的产能约为2万块完整的晶圆，该报告还称，随着时间的推移，这个数字可能会增加。


该计划预计将于12月6日全面披露。包括苹果公司首席执行官蒂姆-库克、英伟达首席执行官黄仁勋和AMD首席执行官Lisa Su在内的科技界名人预计都会到场。据彭博社周四晚上的报道，总统乔-拜登，商务部长吉娜-雷蒙多据说也会出席。


“我们已经做出决定，要从亚利桑那州的一家工厂买断产能，亚利桑那州的这家工厂在2024年开工，所以我们在这个问题上大约有两年的时间，也许更少一点，”据报道，库克在10月份在欧洲的一次会议上说。“在欧洲，我确信，随着这些计划变得更加明显，如有必要我们也将从欧洲采购。”


台积电在亚利桑那州的芯片制造厂于2021年6月开始施工。该公司最初预计在2022年9月启动生产，但时间表被推后了约6个月--这一延迟将全部芯片制造推到了2024年。


据报道，亚利桑那州的劳动力储备也给台积电带来了挑战。英特尔已经雇用了12000名员工，并寻求为其扩建的设施再雇用3000名员工。台积电在为其新工厂寻找人才时，将不得不在这个失业率已经很低的地区竞争，干净的水的供应可能也是一个问题。


台积电似乎对在美国能够取得的成功水平持怀疑态度。而且，从台积电亚利桑那购买的芯片仍将不得不运往中国或印度生产iPhone，如果苹果要保持目前生产iPhone的地点不变。到2024年，转向美国本土的iPhone生产似乎不太可能。


7月份，台积电的股票在今年下跌了35%。到9月30日，它下跌了41%。11月3日，它达到了2022年的最低点，年内下跌了49%。

And obviously, I still didn't write a bash script to auto-mount the luks partition because I'm too lazy to rtfm, and frankly I'm of the opinion that this should be an option somewhere ("remember password forever" does nothing because you are forced to use the keyring anyway).
 So as I was manually typing the decryption password every time I wanted to go to the second HDD, the computer kept pestering me about some keychain or whatever. On Chromium, it at least used to stop after you told it to frick off like 20 times, but this one never did (nor does it on Chromium anymore.. sigh..).
 Anyway, I never dove deep into it and it was absolutely logical to me that a keyring was something useful. And what would be useful but a fully functioning automounting with password pre-saved and encrypted. Frankly I thought that the keychain was the encryption key for the password, and that the computer uses it so it isn't stored in plaintext.
 So long story short, I still have to manually type the password, just not my decryption password, but the keychain password. How utterly useless. Replacing one password with another. What is the purpose of this? Who wants this? Why am I being pestered about this every singe time, and how the heck do I revert it or change the keyring password?
 In short, if linux is about freedom, then NO means NO whne I tell you to buzz off for the 54th time you ask me if I want a keychain. We need to stop this!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[在 Arch Linux 及其衍生版中安装 OpenOffice 的初学者指南。


OpenOffice 是最古老的自由开源的办公生产力套件，已经维护了一段时间。它是由 Apache 开发，尽管它已经被分叉为 LibreOffice，但仍然是一个受欢迎的套件。

本教程适用于那些想要安装 OpenOffice 以满足工作和其他需要的人。

注意：在安装之前，请记住许多更新的功能和与微软 Office 的兼容性在 OpenOffice 中并未得到完全支持。如果你想要更现代的 Office 套件版本，请尝试 LibreOffice。

在 Arch Linux 中安装 OpenOffice

OpenOffice 软件包 在 Arch 用户仓库中可用。因此，要安装它，你需要使用 AUR 助手程序。这是你需要做的。按照下面提到的步骤安装 Yay AUR 助手。如果你想了解有关 Yay 的更多信息，请参阅 此处提供 的详细指南。

依次运行以下命令来安装基本包并克隆 Yay：

sudo pacman -S base-develsudo pacman -S gitcd /optsudo git clone https://aur.archlinux.org/yay.git


通过将 debugpoint 替换为你的 Arch 系统的用户名来运行以下命令：

sudo chown -R debugpoint:users ./yay


最后，使用以下命令安装 AUR 助手：

cd yaymakepkg -si


完成后，使用以下命令安装 OpenOffice：

yay -S openoffice-bin




按照屏幕上的说明进行操作。安装后，你可以在应用菜单中找到它，如下图所示。

启动 OpenOffice 并将你的姓名和详细信息添加到启动向导中，你就可以使用了。





总结

使用上述方法，你还可以在 Majnaro 和其他基于 Arch Linux 的发行版中安装 OpenOffice。尽管它是一个较旧的办公生产力套件，但你应该记住，它并不完全兼容现代微软 Office 文档类型（例如 docx、xlsx）。

如果你在安装过程中遇到任何错误，请在下面的评论栏中给我们留言。

Mastodon 的安全性并不可靠

自从 Twitter 被收购后，Mastodon 引来了大量注意，用户数量激增，两周内总用户达到 870 万。有安全专家发现多个存在安全漏洞的 Mastodon 实例。Mastodon 项目缺乏专门的安全团队，甚至软件也没有自动更新或检查更新的功能。

目前全球有数以百万计的网站依赖 Let's Encrypt 作为安全保障。其 2022 年年度报告中称，截至 2022 年 11 月 1 日，它为超过 3.09 亿个域名提供了证书，仅 2022 年增加了逾 3300 万个域名。Let's Encrypt 在 2017 年 6 月签发了第一亿个证书。三年后的 2020 年 2 月签发了第 10 亿个证书。

老王点评：Let's Encrypt 功莫大焉，要是一直由 CA 公司把持 SSL 证书的签发，HTTPS 的普及可能会慢得多。]]></summary>

广州小雪过后的天气晴阴无定，冷暖交替。虽然蛰居乡野，暂离尘嚣，在这样时令中读书的心情仍然很受影响。原以为在这时没什么心情读那些大部头的书，但是前几天参加由新京报书评和广西师大社上海分部组织的线上读书谈，主题就是在今天为什么要读“厚重之书”，正好应对了时下的读书心情。何谓“厚重之书”? 在我看来很难下一个严格的定义，只能说它有一个大致的指向。大部头的篇幅固然是一个因素，但还有更重要的因素是内容、思想内涵、经典地位以及面向现实和未来的开放性意义。有些“导读”“讲义”类著作的篇幅并不“厚重”，但是同样可以以其学术与思想含量给人以厚重之感。例如英国学者西蒙·斯威夫特（Simon Swift）的《导读阿伦特》（陈高华译，重庆大学出版社，2018年）是“劳特利奇批判思想家”（Routledge Critical Thinkers）系列中的一本，这套丛书的“编者前言”说，该丛书致力于把那些重要思想家和他们的观念放回原本的语境中论述，从而引导读者阅读思想家的原著。或许在专业研究者看来，这类“导读”面向初学者和学生，往往不具有学术上的深度和作者的独创性思维。但是，有一次当我和尔克讨论这类“导读”书的时候，他却提出了一些反证，例如那套“牛津通识读本”中的《维特根斯坦与哲学》（by A. C. Grayling），不仅对概述性的导读持有高度谨慎的态度，同时对维特根斯坦在晚近哲学中的地位和影响也提出了不乏独创性和争议性的见解，这说明不可否认的是，有些“导读”的学术目标并不满足于概述与介绍；当然他也认为过于充满个人性和争议性的“导读”实际上或许难以符合这类丛书读物的初衷。这是一个颇有意思的关注视角，或许可以让我们重新思考何谓“厚重之书”。

一
北魏末年，政治衰乱，兵连祸结。北方六镇、关陇、河北、山东等地相继爆发起义，北魏王朝陷于分崩离析状态，旋即分裂为东魏和西魏。534年，渤海王高欢立孝静帝，定都邺城（今河北临漳县），史称东魏；550年，高欢之子高洋废东魏，建立北齐。535年，关西大行台宇文泰在长安拥立文帝，史称西魏；557年，宇文泰之子宇文觉废西魏，建立北周。建德六年（577年），北周武帝宇文邕灭北齐，统一了中国北部。
政权的对立却不能影响文化的同源与发展，北方东西对峙的两个政权，在佛教艺术的传承上保持了高度一致性，均沿袭北魏王朝平城和洛阳时代皇室权贵开窟造像的传统，石窟寺艺术继续蓬勃发展。
北魏都平城时期，在今大同以西武州山开凿窟龛百余，其中最早的五座石窟是文成帝命沙门统昙曜开凿的，是为“昙曜五窟”。及至献文、孝文诸帝，都在这里大量兴造。云冈石窟气势磅礴，最大的佛像高达十余米，真容巨壮，雕饰奇伟。孝文帝迁都洛阳后，石窟艺术更形发展，宣武帝在洛阳以南伊阙龙门山营造石窟，为父母孝文帝和文昭皇太后并自身各建一窟，凡为三所，工程浩大，斩山数十丈，二十余年中用人工八十万以上。至于高官显贵的造像也是盛极一时，龙门断壁上石龛遍布，石佛林立。云冈石窟与龙门石窟，成为中国古代雕刻艺术的两大宝库，正是在这样的时代背景下，东西对峙的两个政权各自开窟造像，石窟寺艺术蔚为大观。
东魏北齐时期，最重要的石窟寺是由高齐皇室、显贵及高僧经营开凿的响堂山石窟。其中北响堂石窟是规模最大的石窟寺，为高齐皇室所开，雕刻精美，气势恢弘，充分显示了皇家造像的非凡气度，是东魏北齐石窟造像的精粹所在。北响堂以北洞体量最大，开凿年代最早，洞窟面阔、进深、高均十余米。南响堂石窟由灵化寺僧慧义兴凿，丞相高阿那肱资助修成，并有北齐最高僧官之一沙门统定禅师参与石窟开凿。
西魏北周时期，虽没有发现皇室开窟造像的记载，…]]></summary>

 You just need to tell Flatpak apps where to look for it:
  
Set a couple overrides to expose the GTK and QT configurations in ~/.config.
 For GTK, find and install the GTK themes as Flatpaks from Flathub.
 For QT, install every org.kde.KStyle.Kvantum Flatpak package. (Different apps may use different runtimes, so just grab all the versions.)
 For QT, also copy the QT themes from /usr to ~/.config if they aren't already there.
  
This assumes that your system is already set up to use Kvantum in QT5CT/System Settings/Whatever— I recommend that anyway as it's worked pretty well for me.
 So after doing this, the global system state should be something like below:

        <id>https://linux.cn/article-15306-1.html?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss</id>
        <link href="https://linux.cn/article-15306-1.html?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss"/>
        <updated>2022-12-01T01:41:12.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[埃隆·马斯克证实，加密私信即将到来! 这是好东西。




今年早些时候，埃隆·马斯克 在 Twitter 上表示：Twitter 的 私信Direct Messages（DM）需要像 Signal 协议这样的 端到端加密End-to-End Encryption。

早在 2016 年，爱德华·斯诺登就 要求 Twitter 的前首席执行官兼联合创始人杰克·多尔西添加 Signal 协议类似的安全措施到 Twitter 平台。

但是，这个协议从来没有被添加到 Twitter。它可能经过测试但还未部署实施。

根据最近的公告，Twitter 似乎即将实现这个安全协议 😌。

马斯克分享了他在公司演讲中的几张幻灯片，其中就包括为 Twitter 2.0 路线图规划的“加密私信”。

🔒 Twitter 通信的 Signal 协议



虽然有一些安全研究员，例如 黄文津，已经在 Twitter 的 iOS 和 Android 应用程序中发现了对 Signal 协议 的代码引用。

但是直到现在，埃隆·马斯克才在 推文 中确认了该计划，该推文介绍了根据 “Twitter 2.0” 路线图将对 Twitter 平台进行的改进。

换句话说，埃隆·马斯克正式确认 Twitter 即将推出加密私信。



对于那些不知道 Signal 协议的人，我们简要地介绍一下 Signal 协议：Signal 协议是一种开源的加密协议，它允许以 完全前向保密perfect forward secrecy（PFS）方式实施端到端加密。

该协议使用 “双棘轮算法Double Ratchet algorithm”，通信双方根据不断变化的共享密钥，来交换加密的消息。

这确保没有第三方可以得到通信消息的内容，因为共享密钥仅存在于通信双方的设备上。

Signal 应用程序充分利用了这个方法。但是，进一步来说，还有几个以隐私为中心的替代方案：

（LCTT 译注：Signal 协议是一种真正的端到端加密的通讯协议，号称是世界上最安全的通讯协议。只有参与通讯的用户可以读取并解密信息，而任何第三方（包括服务器）都无法查看到通讯的内容。总的来说，它可以防止潜在的窃听者（包括：通信服务商、互联网服务提供商甚至是该通讯系统的提供者），获取能够用以解密通讯内容的密钥。目前有大量即时通讯软件也使用或借鉴参考了 Signal 协议，例如：Skype、What'sApp、Facebook Messenger）

Signal 协议如何帮助 Twitter DM？

它可以防止恶意攻击者和政府去窥探 Twitter 用户的消息，从而使 Twitter 成为一个更加安全的平台。

Twitter 添加加密私信会对举报人、记者和社会活动家有益，因为他们经常会因其工作而面临被审查或成为攻击目标。

诚然，就隐私而言，加密私信可能不是最严格的保护措施。但有总比没有好。

🔏 加密消息应该成为通讯软件的标准

在这个动荡的信息时代，我们看到更多的恶意攻击者试图未经授权访问敏感信息。

端到端加密应成为所有通讯软件的必要标准，我希望 Twitter 能够尽快添加它。

 I changed my user agent to chrome to see if that would work. And of course it went past the starting page. After I took the url of the document management page, switched my user agent back and went to that url. It took me back to the starting page 
 This means the code of google docs is set to deny service to anyone not using chromium by a perceived “glitch” and if the glitch was not intentional. It would be found and patched by the trillion dollar corporation of google. 
 I must conclude this is an intentional obstruction of utility to push a product made by google 
 Google images dose “function” but it’s UI changes to a half working, barely functional system 
 I am getting rid of Google products in my life soon. Their hostile tactics to make as much money as possible to detriment of utility unacceptable

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey HN,
I'm Gabriel, founder of Meticulous.
Our mission is to make the world's code safe, performant and reliable. We're starting with a tool to catch JavaScript regressions in web applications with zero-effort from developers.
How it works: Insert a single line of JavaScript onto your site, and we record thousands of real user sessions. We then replay these sessions on new code to automatically catch bugs before they hit production. You can watch a 60-second demo at meticulous.ai.
We are a London-based YC company. Our engineering team previously worked at Dropbox, Opendoor and Google. We just raised $4m, and are backed by some of the best founders and technical leaders in Silicon Valley, including Guillermo Rauch (founder Vercel, author next.js), Jason Warner (CTO GitHub), Scott Belsky (C…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This doesn't mean that realtek is better or Intel is worse, I just think that what wifi card is that best is not as cut and dry as folks make it out to seem. On my current HP laptop and my previous Dell laptop, Intel wifi cards will drop out every 30 minutes to an hour or so. I have to go into airplane mode or log out to get it to work again. This realtek card, no matter how much folks dislike it, has been a solid workhorse for me.
 I know there's been a lot of talk this week about the state of linux wireless, and I just wanted to put out there that I don't think it is as easy as just putting an intel card in a linux machine.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[苹果公司对中国制造业的广泛敞口，因其成本低和风险上升而备受关注，公司供应链数据显示，自COVID-19大流行病开始以来，这种敞口已经消退了。随着富士康在中国中部经营的全球最大的iPhone工厂出现劳动力和产能问题，分析师预计苹果的产能转换工作将加速。


路透社对苹果公司供应链数据的分析显示，中国在该公司全球制造业中的突出地位正在下降。在截至2019年的五年里，中国是其44%至47%的供应商生产基地的主要地点，但2020年下降到41%，2021年下降到36%。


这些数据显示了苹果公司及其供应商的多元化驱动，在印度和越南的投资以及从台湾地区、美国和其他地方的采购增加，正在重塑全球供应结构，尽管分析师和学者们说，在未来许多年里，它仍将严重依赖中国。


康奈尔大学研究中国劳工的副教授Eli Friedman说：“中国的供应链不会在一夜之间消失。对这些公司来说，被取代暂时还不现实，”尽管他预计多样化会加速。


苹果的供应商集中在中国，富士康生产的iPhone占全球供货量的70%，这一直是世界上最赚钱的智能手机供应商苹果的一个关键特征。


知情的政府官员本月早些时候告诉路透社，富士康正在加紧在印度的扩张，计划在两年内将其iPhone工厂的员工人数增加四倍。


摩根大通预计，从今年年底开始，苹果将把约5%的iPhone 14生产转移到印度，到2025年，每四部iPhone中就有一部在印度生产，并估计到2025年，约25%的苹果产品，包括Mac电脑、iPad、Apple Watch和AirPods，将在中国以外的地方生产，而现在只有5%。


然而，根据路透社的分析，到2021年的苹果供应商数据显示，到目前为止，没有任何地方能成为与中国的下降相匹配的大幅增长一方。


美国从2019年的7.2%上升到2021年的10.7%，其次是台湾地区，从6.7%上升到9.5%。印度仍然是一个相对较小的存在，从不到1%上升到1.5%，而越南从2.2%扩大到3.7%。


“越南和印度不是中国。”康奈尔大学的弗里德曼说：“他们无法以这种规模、质量和周转时间以及基础设施的可靠性进行生产。”


苹果公司的年度供应链数据涵盖其顶级供应商中的600多个地点，这些供应商占苹果公司直接支出的98%。苹果公司没有披露它与每个供应商的花费，而且名单上的供应商每年都会发生变化，因为不同的公司在苹果公司的数千家供应商中脱颖而出。它们包括组装iPhone、iPad、手表和无线耳机的合同制造商，以及芯片、玻璃、铝壳、电缆、电路板和其他部件的供应商。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It was only a matter of time before somebody found a way to inject BPF into
the CPU scheduler.  This patch
series, posted by Tejun Heo and containing work by David Vernet, Josh
Don, and Barret Rhoden, does exactly that.  The cover letter covers the
motivation behind this work in detail:


	One of our main goals was to lower the barrier to entry for
	experimenting with the scheduler. sched_ext provides ergonomic
	callbacks and helpers to ease common operations such as managing
	idle CPUs, scheduling tasks on arbitrary CPUs, handling preemptions
	from other scheduling classes, and more. While sched_ext does
	require some ramp-up, the complexity is self-contained, and the
	learning curve gradual. Developers can ramp up by first
	implementing simple policies such as global FIFO in only tens of
	lines of code, and then continue to learn the APIs and building
	blocks available with sched_ext as they build more featureful and
	complex schedulers.


There is a bit more documentation in this
patch.]]></summary>

英伟达最近发布的一篇论文，披露了其为《我的世界》游戏训练的通用 AI 代理 MineDojo。研究人员给它输入了 73 万个 YouTube 视频（转录了超过 22 亿字），抓取了 7000 个维基网页，以及 34 万个 Reddit 帖子和 660 万条评论。人们可以用高级自然语言告诉 MineDojo 代理在游戏中做什么。不同于其它为电子游戏开发的 AI，它们往往只擅长特定的任务，研究人员开发了一个可扩展的训练框架，能够成功执行各种开放式任务的通用代理。

老王点评：能根据自然语言进行游戏，这距离通用 AI 更进一步了。




GPT-3 可以写押韵的诗歌和歌词

OpenAI 宣布了 GPT-3 的一个新模型，人们发现它可以生成押韵的歌曲、打油诗和诗歌，而这是 GPT-3 以前无法产生的水平。用机器生成诗歌并不新鲜，甚至早在 1845 年，发明家们就已经在想办法通过自动化来写出有表现力的诗句。但是，专家们特别指出，GPT-3 的最新模型可以将有关各种主题和风格的知识整合到一个能写出连贯文字的模型中。

老王点评：AI 甚至可以写押韵的诗歌，比那些下三路诗歌强了不止一点。




API 安全漏洞成为大量泄露数据的重要风险

恶意行为者利用 2021 年 12 月披露的一个 API 漏洞，获得了超过 540 万 Twitter 用户的数据。报告称，在过去 12 个月里，95% 的企业在生产用的 API 中遇到了安全问题，20% 的企业由于 API 中的安全漏洞而遭受数据泄露。API 攻击的一个不幸的现实是，这些系统的漏洞提供了对前所未有的数据量的访问。

老王点评：API 是一道通向内部的门，而设计一个完善安全的 API 的重要性，往往被人忽视。]]></summary>

 Suppose I have a simple program in any language, e.g. python in this case:

 And we run it from a terminal with an input stream, e.g. "python3 programName <text.txt", where "text.txt" is a file with one line that says "John" say, then we see this output in the terminal:
 What is your name?Hello, John. 
 But if we run the program manually, and type in "John", then we see something different:
 What is your name? John Hello, John 
 Is there clever trick we can use to make it so that the first method produces output similar to the second method? We want "python3 programName <text.txt" to produce:
 What is your name? John Hello, John. 
 using some clever modification to the command line we issue. In summary, we want to see the word "John" appear twice (without modifying the python program content)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Midori 网页浏览器还是活跃的，即将到来的更新整合了一个开源搜索引擎！




几年前，Midori 是一个相当受欢迎的轻量级开源网页浏览器。

有些人认为它已经终止了，不知道它是否还在活动。

好消息是：

作为一个 自由开源的 产品，Midori 网页浏览器是活跃的（在测试阶段）、可用的 。

它是一个基于 Chromium 的以 Electron 构建的浏览器，但没有谷歌的东西和隐私保护功能。


💡 2019 年，该项目被终止，并与 Astian 合并为一个移动浏览器，当时我们并没有立即得到消息该浏览器是否将卷土重来或保持开源。


此外，在即将到来的浏览器更新中，他们计划将自己的开源搜索引擎 AstianGO 与之整合。🤯

这与 Brave（及其搜索引擎）有些类似，但 Brave Search 不是开源的。

AstianGO：开源搜索引擎

在一个 Reddit 帖子 中，来自 Astian 的某个人宣布计划在 Midori 网页浏览器中集成一个开源搜索引擎，即 AstianGO，并在下次更新时加入。

源代码还没有发布，应该可以通过 这个 GitLab 页面 获得。



透露的细节不多，但以下是他们提到的内容：


我们已经实现并开发了一个完全开源的搜索引擎，没有使用第三方的 API，它不存储用户的 IP 地址，不存储搜索历史。我们把这个搜索引擎称为 AstianGO，这个搜索引擎是用 PHP 开发的，它是自我托管的，尽管它还没有一个集成的更新系统，人们可以把它部署在他们的服务器上。


该搜索引擎使用来自谷歌、Qwant 和 Brave Search 的数据来提供结果。你可以看看它的 FAQ 来了解它的工作原理。

其他的浏览器，有些集成了以隐私为重点的搜索引擎，有些承诺提供隐私保护功能。



当然，这个搜索引擎看起来是一个正在进行的工作。

但是，一个开源的网页浏览器，带有隐私保护的搜索引擎（也是开源的），可能对大多数用户来说是带有太多不确定性。



Midori 的目标是通过这一补充来改变这一状况。

Midori 网页浏览器的状态

这听起来不错，但我认为这并没有充分的计划。

有一个 AppImage 和一个 .deb包 可用。它也可用于其他平台。

我试着从它的 下载页面 安装 Midori 浏览器（.deb 包），但我无法在 Ubuntu 22.04 LTS 上安装它 🚫

AppImage 文件可以使用 ✅

下载页面没有反映出所有的信息来告知 Linux 发行版的支持情况；它只是提到了 Debian x64，并没有完全翻译成英文。



所以，我不确定我们是否可以推荐使用该浏览器。

当然，考虑到它还在测试阶段，你不应该依赖它。你可以浏览它的 GitLab 页面 来了解更多。

思考？

我认为一个新的开源搜索引擎是一件好事。我仍然不确定 Linux 的 Midori 网页浏览器是否可以推荐，我需要通过测试才能在将来推荐它。

_是这个开源搜索引擎更让你兴奋，还是浏览器？请在下面的评论中告诉我你的想法。

如果你了解美国城市史，你一定知道斯蒂芬·塞恩斯托姆（Stephan Thernstrom）；如果你想了解美国城市史，你一定要知道斯蒂芬·塞恩斯托姆。在史学界，那些能够对社会已经达成共识的重大历史问题做出新解释的学者并不多见，那些能够开创新研究范式的学者也算得上是圈中顶流，而塞恩斯托姆几乎都做到了。在《其他波士顿人：美国大都市的贫穷与进步，1880-1970》（The Other Bostonians: Poverty and Progress in the American Metropolis, 1880-1970, Cambridge, Mass: Harvard University Press, 1973）中，他将目光投向美国的社会流动性（social mobility），试图用最可靠的数据告诉我们，这种流动性究竟有多高。
美国人对白手起家的传奇总是津津乐道，钢铁大亨安德鲁·卡内基、脱口秀主持人奥普拉·温弗瑞、“星巴克之父”霍华德·舒尔茨以及首位非裔美国人总统巴拉克·奥巴马，都是美国穷小子变成精英的典型。他们的经历，在不同的年代里提醒着一代代美国人，霍雷肖·阿尔杰（Horatio Alger Jr.，1834-1899，美国儿童文学作家，作品大多描写穷孩子如何通过勤奋和诚实获得成功）的故事永不过时。事实似乎真的就像劳伦斯·塞缪尔说的那样，在美国，“任何怀有果敢精神的人通过辛勤劳动都可以登上胜利的顶峰”。美国社会乐于标榜自己的社会流动性更高，以此来说明美国是一片人人都能找到机遇的乐土。可是，这样的看法到底是真是假？

Cinnamon 桌面环境 是 Linux Mint 的默认桌面风格。创建这个基于 GTK 的桌面环境是为了提供具有以前的 GNOME 的传统桌面风格（即 GNOME 3 之前的外观）。该桌面本身很轻巧，非常人性化。因为它保留了经过时间考验的图标和菜单驱动的桌面行为，因此它被认为（与 Linux Mint 结合）是新 Linux 用户易于使用的桌面之一。

尽管 Cinnamon 及其软件包与 Linux Mint 紧密结合，但该桌面可以作为单独的桌面环境安装在 Ubuntu、Fedora 或 Arch Linux 中。

在 Arch Linux 中安装 Cinnamon 相当容易，就像在 Arch 中安装其他桌面（例如 Xfce 和 KDE Plasma）一样。但它需要安装一些特定的软件包才能使其看起来像一个合适的 Cinnamon 桌面。

让我们开始吧。

在 Arch Linux 中安装 Cinnamon 桌面

第 1 步：安装基本系统

本指南假设你已经安装了基本的 Arch 系统。如果你没有安装基本系统，请按照 自动化 Arch 安装指南（推荐方法）进行安装。然后按照以下步骤操作。

第 2 步：更新你的系统

在你的 Arch 中打开一个终端。并通过运行以下命令确保系统是最新的：

pacman -Syu


第 3 步：安装 yay AUR 助手

配置 Cinnamon 所需的某些包在 Arch 官方仓库中不可用。它们在 Arch 用户仓库（AUR）中。因此，你需要安装 yay 以获得额外的软件包。按照 本指南安装 yay AUR 助手。

如果在古代文学领域评选存在感最低的断代文学，北朝文学或许能够摘得“桂冠”。这个阶段看起来缺少名作和名家，其中最著名的庾信还是位南方“移民”。然而北朝绝不是一个沉寂的时代，华夷、士庶、文武诸多元素杂糅在这段历史中，文化、政治等诸多变革也发生在北方的大地。其文学上的尴尬地位，很大程度上来自于简单的标签化定义。质朴贞刚、南北融合是北朝文学的标志特点和脉络，二者共同搭建起了北朝文学史的基础框架。这些关于北朝文学的经典论断皆来源于《魏书》《周书》《北齐书》《隋书》以及《北史》五部正史。以上史书除了《魏书》，其余诸部皆编写于唐代，可以说，今天的我们正是透过唐代史官的“眼睛”来了解北朝文学的，而唐人南北争胜的立场，影响着我们看待这段风云诡谲历史的视野与焦点。因此，深入理解正史叙事塑造的北朝文学之框架，探索其中的内涵和外延，是开拓北朝文学时代视野重要路径。
一、文与质：南北争胜的叙事与视野
魏徵《隋书·文学传序》提出南北文风差异说，在两者的对比中首次确立了北朝文学“质”的特点。
暨永明、天监之际，太和、天保之间，洛阳、江左，文雅尤盛……彼此好尚，互有异同。江左宫商发越，贵于清绮；河朔词义贞刚，重乎气质。气质则理胜其词，清绮则文过其意。理深者便于时用，文华者宜于咏歌。
此论断影响深远，现代研究多遵循其说作为北朝文学的立论基础。但统揽诸史的论述，这个奉为圭臬的经典观点仍值得思考。《隋书》选取北魏洛阳以及北齐邺城的文学冠以“贞刚气质”的特性。“质”作为与“文”相对的文学属性，具有的内涵是：内容重于形式，实用大于抒情。在魏徵的定义中，洛阳、邺城文学具有自身独特的审美属性，与南朝吟咏性情、文辞绮丽的文风明确划清了界限。然而其他诸史中却对其持以完全相反的定义。如《周书·苏绰传》则认为“逮乎江左，弥复轻薄。洛阳后进，祖述不已”，洛阳文学崇尚学习南朝绮靡风气…]]></summary>

这份分步指南将向你展示如何使用 Kubeadm 工具在 Debian 11 上安装 Kubernetes 集群。

Kubernetes（k8s）集群包含主控节点和工作节点，用于运行容器化的应用程序。主控节点作为控制平面，工作节点为实际工作负载提供环境。

前置条件：


已安装 Debian 11

2 CPU / vCPU

2 GB RAM

20 GB 空闲硬盘空间

有管理员权限的 sudo 用户

稳定的网络连接


实验环境配置：

在本文中，我使用了 3 个 Debian 11 系统的节点，配置如下


主控节点（k8s-master） – 192.168.1.236

工作节点 1（k8s-worker1） – 192.168.1.237

工作节点 2（k8s-worker2） – 192.168.1.238


事不宜迟，我们直接进入安装步骤。

1、设置主机名和更新 /etc/hosts 文件

在主控节点和工作节点上使用 hostnamectl 命令来设置主机名：

$ sudo hostnamectl set-hostname "k8s-master"       // 在主控节点运行
$ sudo hostnamectl set-hostname "k8s-worker1"      // 在工作节点 1 运行
$ sudo hostnamectl set-hostname "k8s-worker2"      // 在工作节点 2 运行


在所有节点的 /etc/hosts 文件末尾添加下面几行内容：

192.168.1.236       k8s-master
192.1…]]></summary>

 Okular, qpdfview, Evince, Atril, xpdf are affected. But internet browsers (except Falkon!), and other PDF viewers (WPS PDF, LibreOffice Draw, ImageMagick, mupdf, gv, PDF Studio Viewer, Foxit, Master PDF) are not affected.
 Such PDF pages/files have some obscure variations or defaults that cannot be handled by poppler. They can be fixed by printing them "as pdf" in Firefox or other browsers (in Chrome, Vivaldi, Opera you have to select "print to image" too) or in PDF viewers that can see in the first place the otherwise blank pages and are able to print to file/pdf: 
 * PDF Studio Viewer has the option "print to file"
 * Master PDF Editor has the option "System print", and under there it's the needed option

authority to run its servers; anyone can run their own.  Servers communicate
with each other, allowing people on different servers to send each other

I have an idea for a specification that apps could use to describe a layout of widgets (butons, sliders, checkboxes, menus, etc) to the window manager/compositor, which could then draw it on the titlebar of the app. This combines the benifits of both CSD and no-CSD, but most importantly it makes everyone happy.
 Originally, I went to the XDG mailing list and asked them if it could become a spec, and gave some examples of how it could benifit a couple of desktop environments I mentioned. Basially all the told me is that "GNOME probably won't add support for that" and "GTK headerbars won't work with that design".

 So every couple of weeks or so, I kept trying Wayland to see how it's working, and I never dreamt of being able to use Wayland for at least another year. This is because I have always had severe graphical problems, visual glitches and intense lags.
 However, about 48 hours ago I decided to switch to Wayland once again and try it, and what do you know, I've actually had almost 0 problems (And the ones I had were so rare and minor).
 So for once, I am actually using Wayland and loving it. Might be worth trying Wayland again if you have been in my shoes. (Haven't had much luck with KDE Wayland still)
 Thank you, everyone who has worked to have it working like it is now.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[消息应用Telegram的首席执行官Pavel Durov周三表示，在不到一个月的时间里，Telegram通过其基于区块链的拍卖平台Fragment，已经售出了5000万美元的用户名。这个数字说明了Telegram第二次启动自己的加密货币基础设施的成功。Fragment是建立在Telegram Open Network之上的，Durov在2020年的监管压力下放弃了这个区块链，后来在其社区的支持下又宣布回归。


在Fragment强劲销售的支持下，Durov正在为Telegram设定一个更深入的加密货币建设的路线。他说，该公司将建立一个去中心化的交易所和非托管的钱包，可以覆盖数百万用户。Telegram已经是许多加密货币交易商的首选消息应用程序。


该声明是首次确认Telegram直接参与将TON区块链整合到信使应用中。早些时候，杜罗夫谈到区块链开发是一个社区项目，Telegram只是乐于观望。


该系统早先被称为Newton和Toncoin，是由Telegram开发的最初TON概念发展而来的两个竞争对手项目之一。这两个项目都是由社区的支持者开发的，尽管最后只有一个得到了Telegram的官方认可。


杜罗夫在其个人频道的一条信息中，将Telegram的努力与失败的加密货币交易所FTX的“过度集中化”进行了对比。


他说：“加密货币用户应该转向无信任交易和自我托管的钱包，不依赖任何单一的第三方。”


周三早些时候，TON网络的支持者宣布了一个1.26亿美元的“救援基金”，以支持被FTX倒闭所困扰的加密货币项目。截至记者发稿时，TON币的交易价格上涨了近4%。

在曾经领袖了 PDA 市场的 Palm 公司于 2011 年被惠普公司关闭之前，PalmPilot 已经走向衰落很多年。但是在上世纪之交使用过 Palm 的人都对它有着深刻的印象。上周，互联网档案馆上传了一个 Palm OS 应用程序的数据库，总共包含大约 560 个程序，介绍了 Palm 发展的历程。

爱普生将结束激光打印机销售

爱普生本月宣布，它将在 2026 年之前结束激光打印机硬件的销售和分销，理由是可持续性问题。该公司称，在环境方面，喷墨打印机比激光打印机有更大的潜力来实现有意义的进步。爱普生的无热喷墨技术通过使用机械能将墨水喷到页面上，消耗的电力比激光打印机更少。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[随着 helloSystem 0.7.0 的发布和更多内部工作，helloSystem 正在增强稳定性，为 macOS 提供一个“开源”的替代方案。


helloSystem 是一个基于 FreeBSD 的轻量级操作系统，旨在为 macOS 提供一个“开源”的替代方案。helloSystem 的主要目标是提供一个易于安装和使用的，真正“开源”的 FreeBSD 替代方案。此外，该团队还专注于从 macOS 转换过来的用户，他们可以舒适的使用类似的桌面，而不会受到系统锁定或 Linux 发行版的复杂性的影响。

考虑到 BSD 系统中的硬件支持，开发这样的操作系统需要时间。团队正在努力从零创建一个桌面 - “hellodesktop”。用 C++ 编写的 hellodesktop 和其他改进正在进行中。



helloSystem 0.7.0

在 2021 年底，该团队发布了最新一个稳定版本，基于 FreeBSD 13.0 的 helloSystem 0.7.0，并且目前正在将系统移植到 FreeBSD 13.1 和 14 版本。

除此之外，一些新功能也可以在系统中工作了；这是一个总览：


由 FreeBSD 13.0 驱动

通过更新的启动时间和压缩的 UFS 文件系统改进的现场介质Live Media

将 ISO 镜像大小减少到 800 MB，以适合 CD

与 Ventoy USB creator 兼容

支持英伟达 GPU，包括旧型号

在目标分区安装时添加了 exFAT 支持

增加了 KDE 开发的 Falkon 浏览器，附带了下载和安装 Chromium 和 Firefox 的附加菜单项

系统提示音

支持通过笔记本电脑键盘的专用键控制亮度和音量




除了上述内容之外，helloSystem 0.7.0 中还添加了一个新部分，以让你可以提前了解团队正在开发的功能。未来版本中将到来的一些最酷的功能包括：


BSD 中的 Debian 运行时安装程序，以在 BSD 中运行 Linux 应用程序！

一个独立的应用程序，用于下载应用程序。

新的更新实用程序


此外，0.7.0 中还修复了一些错误并更新了翻译。



话虽如此，但它仍然需要大量的时间才能成为易于使用的 BSD 变体和 macOS 的“开源”替代方案。自从我 首次报道 以来，已经在图形安装程序，桌面应用程序和错误修复方面进行了巨大的更新。我希望它在随着 2023 年移植到 FreeBSD 14 之后，会变得更加主流。

下载

如果你想在真实的硬件上尝试它，请先进行备份然后尝试。此外，helloSystem 现在完全兼容 VirtualBox 之类的虚拟机。你可以试试。如果你在 VirtualBox 中尝试，请确保将 CPU 更改为 64 位。

官方下载链接（包括 helloSystem 0.7.0 稳定版）可在 此页面 上找到，或者您可以使用下面的链接获取 ISO。


下载 helloSystem 0.7.0


如果你想为测试、开发或任何其他事情做出贡献，请 访问 GitHub 页面以获取详细信息。

那第三方或者外部存储库呢？不，我这里并不是要讲 PPA。

早晚你会碰到那种至少四行的安装说明：你需要安装名为 apt-transport-https 的包、操作一下 GPG 和 源列表source list 之后，你才能正常安装软件包。

没有什么印象的话，那我分享一个 在 Ubuntu 上安装最新版本的 Yarn 的例子：

sudo apt install apt-transport-https curl
curl -sS https://dl.yarnpkg.com/debian/pubkey.gpg | sudo apt-key add -
sudo sh -c 'echo "deb https://dl.yarnpkg.com/debian/ stable main" >> /etc/apt/sources.list.d/yarn.list'
sudo apt update && sudo apt install yarn


当你需要直接从开发者那里安装编程工具的时候，大概率会碰到这种安装方式。

许多人只是按照说明进行操作，并不会去思考其中的原理。这也没什么不对，但了解该过程实际上可以提升你在这方面的知识，而且有助于之后排除故障。

我来解释一下这些代码背后的逻辑。

在你继续往下阅读之前，我强烈建议你先看看下面这两篇文章，方便理解后续的概念：

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[《周书》修订本，中华书局，2022年11月版

二十世纪四十年代陈寅恪先生提出“关陇集团”理论后，包括西魏北周史在内的中古史研究，基本沿“关陇集团”理论展开，形成了深厚学术积累。简而言之，“关陇集团”理论，即指北魏末西入关中的武川镇豪帅宇文泰，在占领关中后，将所占地区内胡汉族群、土著，通过以府兵制为主的“关中物质本位政策”和“周礼官制”为主的“关中文化本位政策”，融合成为拥有共同利益、与东魏北齐、萧梁对抗，建立北周隋唐，延续至唐高宗前期的政治集团。笔者拟就“关陇集团”理论来源、应用到西魏北周史研究中所遇到的问题，谈一下自己的思考。
一、“关陇集团”理论是对宋明史家研究成果的继承和发挥
脱胎于西魏北周的隋唐统一中国，创中古盛世，因此，传统史家十分重视西魏北周史研究，陈寅恪曾感慨“宋贤史学，今古罕匹”（陈寅恪：《隋唐制度渊源略论稿》，《陈寅恪集》，北京生活·读书·新知三联出版社2009年版，148页，以下简称《略论稿》）。陈寅恪“关陇集团”理论的形成，与宋明传统史家研究关系密切。宋人叶适指出宇文泰如王莽，行周官真正目的是要篡西魏，“王莽篡而作大诰，泰用周礼亦然，岂从周之伪者固当尔耶？”（《习学记言序目》，中华书局1977年版，521页，以下简称《记言》）正因如此，宇文泰在用周官设置官职时，仍杂用北魏及秦汉以后官职名称，遵循北魏末权臣尔朱荣以柱国掌握朝政的先例，自称柱国。这使其所行周官显得不伦不类，“而绰方与之法象周公，龟兹王褚煟所讥（非驴非马），依然故在，是真可笑矣！”（《记言》，524页）宋人胡寅《读史管见》卷十四《敬帝·太平元年条》也持此种看法，“今宇文氏之制，何所考哉？至于《周官》之属，有不当设而设者，有不当属而属者，其舛驳甚众”。明人王夫之也指出，宇文泰行周官只是借用周官名目，实现其篡权企图，徒有其表，“泰自以为周公，逆者丧心肆志之恒也”，“高洋之篡也，梁、陈之偷也，宇…]]></summary>

 So, this technically has been an ongoing issue for a while. I had packages that quite simply, would not upgrade, and I had no idea why. It wasn't hurting anything at the time, so I left it alone for a while. But this problem finally came around to bite me. I was trying to upgrade from Ubuntu 20.04 to 22.04, and the upgrade command was telling me to update all my packages to the latest... including the ones that would not update. Uh oh.
 So, I did some investigation; I looked up the packages that were refusing to update, and tried to explicitly upgrade them individually, but they gave me an error that I did not un…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[在之前的文章《iPhone手机安全指南》，介绍了iPhone手机系统上使用的一些安全建议，下面将介绍一些iPhone手机APP的安全建议。


1. 软件安装渠道选择正规渠道来安装


iPhone的应用全部都使用应用商店来安装，不要越狱，不要使用一些第三方工具来安装软件。一般非iPhone手机会提供下载安装APP，这非常不安全，建议使用非iPhone手机的，建议换用iPhone。iOS的应用商店选择美国等其他国家的应用商店，iCloud也一样。安装的APP请求权限时，给最小的权限。一些敏感权限，例如位置、通讯录、摄像头等，只给哪些必要的APP授权使用。


2. 如有可能使用两个手机，将日常使用的APP和敏感工作用的APP隔离成两个手机，互不影响，这样即使一个手机遗失或失去控制，可以用另一个手机使用“查找”APP远程抹除遗失手机上的内容。


3. 手机号码的安全很重要，SIM卡一定要设置密码，遗失手机后第一时间挂失SIM卡。对于敏感APP，建议国内用户不要使用国内手机号码注册敏感APP，要用其他国家的手机号码注册，手机上不建议安装敏感APP，建议通过浏览器的无痕浏览模式登录WEB版网站。


4. 手机上不要安装和使用邮箱APP，也不要在iPhone手机上使用内置的电子邮件功能。否则，一旦手机被第三方获取，通过电子邮箱很可能会给用户带来巨大损失，例如通过邮箱重置各个关键网站或APP的密码，从而获得登录和使用权限，进行各种操作，控制用户的各种关键应用APP等等，使得用户的财产和人身安全遇到重大挑战。]]></summary>

 When a user-mode thread needs to execute a system call, does the user-mode process **switch** to kernel mode and then execute the system call, and then **switch back** to user mode? Or does it delegate this sensitive instruction to a already alive (sleeping) kernel thread via IPC?
 It is said that the switch(if at all it does happen) is expensive. I believe IPC is equally expensive(?)
 EDIT:
 Seems that a userland process has two stacks, one for user mode, one for kernel mode. Hints that the process actually switches modes. But if creating kernel threads are far cheaper, why not bypass the expensive switch and just execute system calls in a newly spawned kernel thread?

据 2022 年 Stack Overflow 开发者调查，只有 9% 的开发者在使用 Rust，但它已经在“最受喜爱”的语言中占据了七年的位置。在今年的调查中，几乎有 87% 的开发者表示他们喜欢 Rust，这比第二大受欢迎的语言 Elixir 高出约 10 个百分点。

Docker Hub 是一个基于云的容器库，允许人们自由搜索和下载 Docker 镜像。除了由 Docker 库项目审查的镜像之外，在该服务上还有数十万个状态不明的镜像。Sysdig 使用其自动扫描器仔细检查了 25 万个未经验证的镜像，并确定其中 1652 个镜像是恶意的。这些恶意行为包括加密矿工、隐藏的认证凭证等。

新加坡将每棵大树都连上物联网

新加坡大约有 700 万棵树，他们通过一个巨大的物联网监测计划对 600 万棵大树进行监控。新加坡国家公园管理局用一个应用程序来管理它们，除了用 LiDAR 采集数据，对每棵植物进行地理定位之外，还通过卫星遥感进行多光谱分析，以确定叶绿素水平，确保树木仍然茁壮成长，以及在树木上安装倾斜传感器确保树木没有被移动或倾倒。

Looking into this, I can't seem to find a clear cut answer as to how the image can exist and be distributed, if it does fall under GPL.
 Some facts I came across:
  
Nvidia is using some compatibility layer trick to sidestep GPL - is this the reason why this is possible?
 Nvidia released (partial?) open-source drivers in 2022 - though I remember the Nvidia-specific image to be on offer even before 2022.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[《周书》修订本，中华书局，2022年11月版

《周书》是记述北魏东西分裂之后西魏和北周政权的纪传体断代史，中华书局点校本由前辈史学大师唐长孺先生负责整理，是“二十四史”中除前四史外出版的第一种。从计划伊始，到1965年完成点校，制版付型，再到最终出书，绵历十余年，其间种种因由，通过留存下来的书稿档案，才得见鳞爪。
1958年，在国务院领导下的古籍整理出版规划小组成立以后，中华书局随即正式启动整理二十四史计划。在同年10月拟订的计划中，整理二十四史被分为标点集注本和普通本两种系列，分别供专门研究者和一般读者需用。在集注本中，鉴于清初李清所撰《南北史合注》芜杂疏陋，而后出考订以及石刻文字等资料大多为其所未见，南北各史的纷乱脱误又较其他各史更甚，故而有新编《南北史补注》的设想。不过二十四史的集注本始终未能落地实施。在同年最早的一份《标点二十四史（普通本）约稿计划》中【图一】，便已经确定南北朝各史分别由山东大学和武汉大学承担，其中北朝四史（《魏书》《周书》《北齐书》《北史》）和《隋书》五种史书的标点整理者都是“拟约武汉大学”（《隋书》后来因武大、山大都未接受，另做了安排），预计完成时间则都是1959年11月。

图一：标点二十四史（普通本）约稿计划

这一时期的点校整理分头在各高校展开，实际开展工作已经晚于计划的完成时间。1960年底，武大历史系内成立了校点小组，由唐长孺任组长，姚薇元为副组长，组员中还包括陈仲安、石泉、赵婷、陈庆中、曹绍廉、谭两宜，正式开始点校工作。初步的整理计划是“先搞《周书》……其余三史，俟《周书》完成继续搞下去”，这也就使得《周书》成为“北朝四史”中最早整理的一种，而规模较大的《魏书》《北史》在此阶段一直没有着手。由于校点组也是第一次进行校史工作，标点和校勘的体例还处于摸索之中，加之时间和任务紧迫，初期也遇到一些困难。在1961年1月赵守俨所拟回复武大历史…]]></summary>

《错乱》这部小说属于拉丁美洲文学中现在很流行的一种特定的文学亚类型，即见证文学。往往是来自独裁、集权、第三世界国家或前社会主义阵营的自由主义知识分子，在后极端的政治情境之中对于普通人生活的描写。在政治腐败、军队独裁等高压制度面前，良知者发展出了一种强调政治作用、强调对普通人生活的记录和记忆的文学类型，尤其伴随着卡罗琳·佛雪、米沃什、索尔仁尼琴等作品在英语世界的畅销，开始蔚然成风。而在西语拉丁美洲文学中，如果以米盖尔·安赫尔·阿斯图里亚斯为起点的话，这些是几乎同步展开的。
但奥拉西奥·卡斯特利亚诺斯·莫亚的这部长篇小说的一个特殊之处，也是正在日渐转型中的当代很多优秀的长篇小说可以看到的一种特殊之处，在于抛弃了客观的、“逼真”的现实主义，而采取了一种主观视角。这和十九世纪中叶至二十世纪中叶的文学主流拉开了距离。我们不能说莫亚就直接地受到意识流小说的影响，尽管他毫无疑问是受到了乔伊斯、伍尔夫、普鲁斯特等现代主义作家群的启示，并且发展了内在聚焦的可能性，把书斋式的梦呓、内心独白与拉丁美洲极端的政治环境和平民生活联系在一起，形成了一种极为“真实”的虚妄语言，而这是远远超出了意识流作家们的蓝图的，倒有点像是伊斯梅尔·卡达莱或乔治·奥威尔与前者“合体”的版本。中国读者一定会在其中发现类似于《狂人日记》的疯狂举动，就像小说的标题本身叫“错乱”，他也是一个黑白颠倒的时代的“狂人”，作为叙事人的“我”是一个参与“历史记忆恢复计划”的编辑（这是一个跟危地马拉天主教会的历史相关的现实指涉），不过，《错乱》叙事者的狂不再是詹姆逊意义上的“民族寓言”，而是一个堕入犬儒主义的镜城的个体。这部小说当然是一个象征性的文本，讲一个人如何在诊断别人的paranoia（精神妄想症）…]]></summary>

2022年9月2日，张文艺葬礼在纽约中国城五福殡仪馆举行，我无法赶回。葬礼上，我们全家由母亲江巫惠淑率江青、江秀、江山、江川献上花圈，悼念这位挚友。想来眼前我唯一可以做的，是以此文聊作对老友的缅念与哀思。
1970年8月下旬，我背井离乡飞往了一个完全陌生的天地——美国洛杉矶，刚结束了痛苦的婚姻，感到自己唯一的出路是斩断一切过往，往前看、往远飞，越远越好。
以前素未谋面的张文艺、周鸿玲夫妇受电影导演陈耀祈之托，热心相助，接机后把我送至友人单氏姐妹家，没多久他们夫妇在圣莫尼卡（Santa Monica）替我觅得一简陋住处，是汽车间房顶加盖上去的一个阳光永远射不进的房间。我从A、B、C开始学英文，其他一切由零开始。他们帮我报名上英文课，申请装电话、接煤气水电、办银行开户手续、学习开车。至今记得文艺教我开车时嚷嚷：“教你开车，怎么你性子比我还急？！”为了设法把家里资助的钱用到最长的时间，我不舍得添置电视机解闷，为了省车费也不舍得出门。
灯下赶不走自己的身影，关了灯我又怕黑，一生中我没有一个人住一整间屋子的经验，尤其是那段时间晚上经常做噩梦，只能彻夜开灯，半夜里要是在灯下醒来，“影子”就更大也更阴森了。越坐越觉得浑身上下发冷发麻，于是就跑到离我住处有十条街的张家“避寒”。记得有几次午夜惊魂（做噩梦），也在半夜打电话求救。自觉打扰他们已经到了不可饶恕的地步，但他们总是伸出温暖的援手。虽然是自己选择到没有人认识我的环境，一切重新开始，但仅仅在一瞬间，我从云端滑入谷底……那年我二十四岁，感念当年他们夫妇雪中送炭并开导我认清残酷无情的现实。记得在美国过的第一个春节，我和他们全家吃了年夜饭后去圣莫尼卡海边散步，星空、巨浪、海风，忽…]]></summary>

一
古者立政安民，必求物尽其用，货畅其流。理财之义，既远且宏。传世先秦文献已多载及贡助之征、关市之税、山泽之赋等事项，又论量入为出、藏富于民诸原理。《尚书·洪范》所言“八政”，首论“食”（劝农业）与“货”（宝用物）；《史记》置《平准书》，专作《货殖列传》；《汉书》设《食货志》，皆关理财之事，而为专门篇章，历代正史多有借鉴。至杜佑作《通典》，切言“理道之先，在乎行教化；教化之本，在乎足衣食”（杜佑：《通典》“序”，中华书局1984年版，第9页），因以《食货》冠诸篇首；马端临《文献通考》因之，而益加详密，首论田赋、钱币、户口诸门，足征其要。
至于清代，理财之政既有旧制相因，又有新制继起，清季尤然。由逊清遗老主笔之《清史稿》，于其《食货志》中追溯称叹康乾盛世“永不加赋”之治；而论清季财政，则曰：“道、咸以降，海禁大开，国家多故。耗财之途广，而生财之道滞。……新政繁兴，孳孳谋利，而于古先圣王生众食寡、为疾用舒之道，昧焉不讲。”（赵尔巽等：《清史稿》卷120《食货一》，中华书局1977年版，3479页）诚然，从洋务运动到清末新政，五十年间百业待举，头绪纷繁，兴办教育尤为其中要项。所谓为政在人，育人由学，而兴学需财，清末尤亟。光绪二十二年（1896）九月，新授安徽巡抚邓华熙在赴任前陛见，君臣问对有此一节：
[光绪皇帝]又云：“凡事破除情面便好。用款必须节去浮费，款归实用才好。”奏云：“臣受皇上厚恩，当尽心竭力，用度可省便省，不至以有用之财办无益之事，有负委任。”上微点首，又云：“西学应办。”奏云：“学堂必须举办，才能造就人才。”上云：“苦于无经费。”奏云：“臣到任后察看情形，设法筹款奏明办理。”（邓华熙著，马莎整理：《邓华熙日记》，凤凰出版社2014年版，178页）

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[国学大师黄侃的父亲黄云鹄（1819-1898），是晚清咸丰、同治年间的名臣与诗文大家，然而晚年仕途坎坷，身后声名黯淡，最终《清史稿》亦未为立传，个中缘由，令人寻味不尽。他有一部特别的著作，名为《念昔斋寤言图纂》，记其家世生平游历见闻，有图画和文字纪事，几乎算得上是个人的画传。四川近代英年早逝的天才学者刘咸炘指出，它可能是模仿清人麟庆的《鸿雪因缘图记》而作（说见《内景楼检书记·史部》）。刘说颇有见地，试看两书图序的标题，都是整整齐齐的四个字，可为一证。此书对于研究黄侃家族历史有重要价值，然而今人有关黄侃生平学术的论著极少引用。
《念昔斋寤言图纂》（下文省称“《图纂》”）有清光绪元年（1875）建南官廨刻本、光绪十二年（1886）成都重刻本。前者有白描图画四十七幅，后者增补为六十九幅。前者影印收入《中华历史人物别传集》（线装书局2003年版）第五十五册，比较容易看到。
                  
这部《图纂》的图画，大多为黄云鹄作品（有些可能是门客所绘）。黄云鹄以诗文名世，兼擅书画艺事，是全才型的学者。三十年前，白彬师、景蜀慧师带领川大历史系本科同学去德阳市孝泉镇实习，我们在孝泉师范学校的教室里，还看到墙壁上镶嵌着黄云鹄诗作的巨幅石刻（诗题《孝泉谒姜公祠敬赋长律》，收入氏著《孝泉游草》），行书隽逸灵动，十分好看。
 
《图纂》光绪元年刻本最末一幅图画为《茅亭课易》，描绘的是黄云鹄教子研读《易经》的情形。画中三人，亭内端坐、手持经书、有髭须者为黄云鹄；中间肃立于书桌前者，当为黄侃兄长中一人；亭外的女性，疑为黄云鹄母胡氏（光绪《黄州府志》卷三〇《人物志》有传，说她“尤喜听诸孙诵书史”）。黄侃出生，正是在《图纂》重刻之时，黄云鹄已年近古稀。光绪十七年，黄云鹄致仕归里，先后客居江宁、武昌等地讲学，去世之时黄侃十三岁。黄侃早年多数时间，都在湖北蔪春乡间读书，远不如诸兄有机会从父…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[如果你正在寻找一种快速的从你的 Windows 计算机传输文件到你的 Linux 计算机的方法，那么开源的 WinSCP 实用程序会使其很容易地通过网络传输文件或文件夹。


有时，你需要通过文件传输文件。有很多文件共享服务，但是大多数的共享服务都要求你发送你的文件到互联网上。当两台计算机并排在一起或在一栋建筑物中时，通过互联网传输文件，这似乎看起来绕了很远的路（更不用说隐私问题）。开源的 WinSCP 实用程序会使其很轻易地通过网络将一个文件或一个文件夹从你的 Windows 计算机传输到你的 Linux 计算机。

IP 地址

在你可以传输之前，你必须知道目标计算机的 IP 地址或完全限定域名。假设它是一台在你的同一个网络上的计算机，并且你没有运行 DNS 服务器来解析计算机名称，你可以在 Linux 计算机上使用 ip 命令来找到目标 IP 地址：

[linux]$ ip addr show |grep 'inet '
inet 127.0.0.1/8 scope host lo  
inet 192.168.1.23/24 brd 10.0.1.255 scope global noprefixroute eth0


127.0.0.1 是一个 环回地址loopback address ，计算机仅使用它来自我通信，因此在这个示例中，正确的地址是 192.168.1.23 。在你的系统中，IP 地址可能会看起来有所不同。如果你不确定哪个是哪个，你可以逐个尝试到你找到正确的 IP 地址 （然后，在一些地方写下来！）

或者，你可以查找你的路由器设置，它列出了所有通过 DHCP 分配的地址。

There are issues with the laptop not sleeping, browsers acting weird when plugged into a monitor, mic and camera issues on Zoom, bluetooth connection issues, etc. Are there less problems on a desktop? I really want to build a PC and run linux on it, but if it's as problematic, it may not be worth it. My distro is Ubuntu.
 On the PC, I'd mainly use it for web browsing and programming, so some issues would be mitigated by transferring some work to a work laptop like for Zoom and work related programming.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[systemd 的速度和易用性使其成为管理现代 Linux 系统的流行方式。




系统管理员知道，在一台运行着的现代计算机上会发生很多事情：应用程序在后台运行、预定事件等待在特定时间被触发、事件写入日志文件、发送状态报告。在以前，不同的进程可以通过一系列 Unix 工具，来进行有效地管理和监控。然而，现代的计算机运作更为复杂了：本地服务与容器化应用程序一同运行、能够轻松访问云及其运行的集群、实时进程、以及有比以往都多的数据。

拥有统一的管理方法不但是用户想要的，也是忙碌的系统管理员所迫切渴望的。为了完成这项重要的任务，系统守护进程system daemon （systemd） 被开发出来，并迅速被所有主要的 Linux 发行版所采用了。

当然，systemd 并不是管理 Linux 系统的唯一方式，还有许多其他可供选择的初始化系统，包括 sysvinit、OpenRC、runit、s6 和 BusyBox，但 systemd 将 Linux 视为一个统一的数据集，意味着 systemd 能用强大的工具对 Linux 进行一致的操作和查询。对于忙碌的系统管理员和许多用户来说，systemd 的速度和易用性是一个重要的特性。有以下的五个原因。

启动管理

启动 Linux 计算机可能是一件非常罕见的事情。服务器的正常运行时间通常以 年 来计算，而不是月或周。笔记本电脑和台式机可能会频繁地关闭和启动，但更多的时候它们是被挂起或休眠了。无论哪种类型，最近一次开机的时刻都可用于检查一段时间内的计算机健康情况，因为当你在监视系统或诊断问题时，这一时刻能够限制查看的数据量大小，从而让你快速地找到问题所在。

如果你不记得上次启动计算机的时间，你可以使用 systemd 的日志记录工具 journalctl，来列出计算机的所有启动会话：

I never installed it until about 2004 when my dad got a way more powerful computer (Dell Dimension 8300) and ended up getting it to successfully install in VirtualPC. I should mention I did attempt to install it on my home PC at the time, a Zenith GT Workstation my mom got for me through a church donation. Either the computer was too old or I was clueless how to get it to work. I do remember the anaconda installer defaulting to a text based setup because the PC was not powerful enough to run the GUI. I think at that point I gave up.
 The same network manager gave me a CD with an early versio…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've tried calibre, okular, bookworm and foliate, with foliate providing by far the nicest experience for ebooks. But that experience is way worse than it is with a typical pdf reader. Latex doesn't render properly, scrolling is choppy, special text formatting (ie. code) doesn't really work, jumping between pages is buggy, etc. The only real advantage I can see is that with ebooks, you can make a section breakless and scrollable which is nice when reading code, whereas pdfs just split it onto multiple pages.

	There is really nothing here that makes me at all worried, except

	have slowed down more by now.

	As a result, I'm now pretty sure that this is going to be one of

 I’m retired now and looking for a simple database/web implementation to play around with some scripting. I’ve been away from Linux for about four years, have MySQL and Perl been replaced by other (just as simple) things? I don’t want a full-time job to implement, just a hobby to toy with.

 So,..(please confirm if this is indeed the case), clone system call is essentially the way for a process to spawn a thread (unlike fork for spawning a process).. and clone accepts parameters w.r.t what exactly it needs to share from the parent, virtual address space being the bare minimum. Turns out, the so-called "thread" is indeed a process in Linux. Inspection of htop, shows that even threads have PIDs. So everything is ultimately a process?

Or rather it will just boot to its console and you'll have to load the main grub.cfg yourself. To avoid this you'll need to mount your ESP read-write and reinstall the bootloader after making that change. Note: update-grub doesn't do this for you.
 I can appreciate why the Grub devs did it this way, but that behaviour was completely opposite to my expectations, considering that most distributions mount the ESP read-only by default, if at all. Anyway, I wasted yesterday evening figuring that out.

I have made it 2/3 of the way; i have changed the settings in the BIOS to start when it get connected to power and I have figured out autologin. The machine will be hidden in a closet and connected to a flat screen tv in a waiting room. When the power is turned on, it should start up and automatically start playing the contents of a folder (or an USB stick?) using the default player (or better) in ubuntu. 
 (tried first with vlc but it was so slow that it was one frame per second. Then tried the built-in player and it did fine). Maybe mplayer will work fine? I don't know yet. 
 I am experienced with Windows but I am a complete n00b when it comes to Linux. So, please explain it like you're explaining it to a toddler. Thanks in advance for helping me :)

But there's a difference between me now and the me 2 years ago. Back then, I loved compiling every program, be as "bloat"-free as possible, did everything from the command line, thinking it was the more efficient way for everything. Now that I think about it, I don't enjoy doing that stuff anymore cuz it just takes up too much time. I now prefer to use GUI apps for almost everything. Stuff like zathura and suckless apps doesn't appeal to me now. What do you think?

 Did some investigating and found the following:

Am getting into CDs again just for the fun of the nostalgia, and I discovered lightscribe is a thing and it looks pretty rad(printing images in gray-scale on the top part of the CD through the CD burner using the laser for those who don't know), but I can't find any software currently available to do it on GNU/Linux, it seems the one from LaCie is not hosted anywhere anymore, the lightscribe website is dead, not sure if it still could run on current distros anyway ...
 ​
 I only use GNU/Linux OSes and I'd like to avoid making a Windows VM just for that, is there a solution? By the way I saw Arch has packages in the AUR that would make it work it seems but am on Fedora and a DNF and flathub search for lightscribe don't return any results :/
 ​
 Can I run some CD burning program from Windows with Wine to do it maybe?
 And by the way am not sure that my computer's CD burner is compatible with lightscribe, I bought it a decade ago to put it in my self-assembled PC, I remember it didn't even came in a proper box back then, just unlabeled cardboard, only thing I know is that it's from Samsung IIRC, is there some way through software means to determine if it supports lightscribe?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[当地时间11月26日，推特首席执行官埃隆·马斯克表示，该社交媒体平台的新用户注册数量达到了“历史最高水平”，并对推特2.0计划的部分内容进行了介绍。


据马斯克在推特上分享了该公司的多张用户数据分析走势图显示，截至11月16日的7天内，推特新用户注册人数平均每日超200万，比2021年同期增长66%。用户活跃时间也达到了历史最高水平，在截至11月15日的7天内，平均每天有近80亿分钟的活跃时间，同比增加了30%。马斯克还预计推特在未来12到18个月内月活跃用户数将超过10亿。


不仅如此，马斯克还分享了推特2.0“万能应用”(everthing app)的部分内容，根据PPT介绍，在Twitter 2.0中，软件将加入包括长推文、视频、支付、加密私信等功能，并在蓝标认证和广告服务等方面做出优化。


不难看出，马斯克将此前大量的想法融入了Twitter 2.0中，试图将其从一个社交平台“改造”为一个综合性平台。


马斯克还称，推特正在应对广告收入下滑的情况。由于部分广告商因用户身份验证等新规则而离开推特，包括通用汽车、大众汽车公司等大公司暂停在平台投放广告，致使该公司广告收入大幅下滑。


据了解，数百名推特员工已经离开这家陷入困境的公司，此前马斯克发出最后通牒，要求员工签署“长时间高强度工作”的协议，否则就离开公司。


值得一提的是，该公司在11月初裁掉了一半员工，包括负责沟通、内容策划、人权和机器学习伦理的团队，以及一些产品和工程团队。

I want to show you MyNixOS.com - a website I've been working on this year to make it easy to create and share Nix and NixOS configurations. Nix is a powerful tool to deploy software in a reproducible way, and with NixOS you can control your whole operating system through a declarative configuration.
Starting out with Nix was exciting, but it definitely had a challenging learning curve. This made me start building a website focused on making it easier to create and share Nix flakes, which are the core unit of software deployment in Nix.
Using the website, you can create flakes without knowing the Nix configuration language, as the necessary Nix files are generated for you. A few examples of what you can do right now:

        <link href="https://linux.cn/article-15294-1.html?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss"/>
        <updated>2022-11-27T03:37:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[htop 是一个流行的命令行工具，可以帮助监测 Linux 上的系统资源和性能。

它比通常默认开箱即用的 top 好。

使用 htop，你可以对进程进行过滤和排序，以便更好地了解情况，获得正在运行的进程的树状视图，并在需要时杀死进程。



我使用 htop 而不是其他系统监控工具，因为它可以显示对我来说至关重要的东西，并允许在我需要控制运行中的服务时终止流氓进程或冻结进程。

但是，如果你想要其他显示更多信息，或一个看起来不同的东西，有哪些htop 替代品呢？让我们来看看。

1、atop



atop 可以提供所有运行的进程的细节。你可以得到你需要的所有数据，以了解你系统上的进程情况。

它还提供了对资源利用率进行永久记录的能力，以便进行长期分析。系统管理员可能会发现这比其他工具更有用。

不幸的是，它并没有为你提供漂亮的输出。因此，如果你想要的话，请继续看下面的其他替代品。

如何安装 atop？

对于基于 Ubuntu/Debian 的发行版，键入：

sudo apt install atop


2、vtop



如果你想要一个漂亮的输出和管理进程的基本功能，vtop 是一个完美的系统监控工具。

正如我在其他一些文章中所说，它的输出看起来像终端中的 GUI。你可以使用鼠标，也可以选择禁用它。也可以定制它的主题。

它是用 Node.js 构建的。所以，你需要安装额外的包来安装它。

不幸的是，这个项目似乎不再积极维护。但是，在写这篇文章的时候，它对我来说还是有用的。

如何安装 vtop？

对于基于 Ubuntu 的发行版，在终端输入以下命令：

sudo apt install nodejs
sudo apt install npm
sudo npm install -g vtop


3、btop++



btop++ 是 bashtop 和 bpytop 的一个 C++ 版本。是的，它是这些项目的第三次迭代，由同一个开发者完成。

btop++ 包括完全的鼠标支持，带有一个受游戏启发的菜单系统，可以让你过滤进程、树状视图等等。

如何安装 btop++？

使用官方软件库，你可以很容易地在 Fedora、openSUSE 和 FreeBSD 上安装它。

对于 Fedora，你可以键入：

sudo dnf install btop


你可以探索它的 GitHub 页面，了解在其他 Linux 发行版上的安装方式。

4、Glances



Glances 与 htop 类似，但有更多的功能。

它是一个跨平台的系统监控工具，可以将数据以 CSV 或其他格式导出，用于 InfluxDB、Elasticsearch 等。

你也可以利用它的网页用户界面，远程（或在不能访问终端的情况下）查看统计数据。

如何安装 Glances？

对于基于 Ubuntu 的发行版，你可以键入：

sudo apt install glances


5、nmon



nmon 是一个令人印象深刻的监测工具，它可以让你控制你想显示的输出内容。

你可以提取监测数据（以 CSV 格式导出）并用于进一步分析。它很容易切换统计数据和在不同的视图之间进行切换。

默认情况下，它每两秒刷新一次数据，但你可以自定义它，并使用更多的选项来调整你的体验。

如何安装 nmon？

你可以在官方软件库中找到它。对于基于 Ubuntu 的发行版，在终端键入以下内容：

sudo apt install nmon


总结

top 2022

top 命令工具被植入在你的 Linux 系统中。如果你想要一个基本的监控工具，想要关注系统进程和一些统计信息，top 就足够了。

我不确定它是否可以算作比 htop 更强的体验，这也是 top 没有被列入主要列表的原因。

正如你在这里看到的，一些监控工具可能很有趣，而且证明比 htop 更有洞察力。

你最喜欢的 htop 替代品是什么？你认为 htop 对你的使用情况来说已经足够了吗？欢迎在下面的评论中让我知道你的想法。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Pantheon 是 elementary OS 的默认桌面环境。本快速指南解释了在 Arch Linux 中安装 Pantheon 桌面环境的步骤。


Pantheon 是 elementary OS 使用的一个漂亮的桌面环境。它基于 GTK3（GTK4 移植正在进行中）和 Vala，是一个漂亮而干净的桌面，为你提供了一个精致的 Linux 桌面体验。

该桌面主要由 elementary OS 使用。elementary OS 提供了 Pantheon 桌面的修改版，它是基于 GNOME 的。

elementary OS 基于 Ubuntu LTS 版本。因此，在基于 Ubuntu 的发行版中安装 Pantheon 桌面是超级容易的。这意味着如果你想在不安装 elementary OS 的情况下体验 Pantheon，在 Ubuntu 中这只需要一两个命令就可以安装。

在 Fedora 中，你也可以使用组包进行安装。然而，一个以 Fedora 为基础，名为 Ultramarine Linux 的发行版默认提供了它。

但是，在 Arch Linux 中安装 Pantheon 需要一些工作。它不是用简单的 pacman 命令就能直接完成的，而且不能开箱即用。需要一些配置，这可能会破坏你的系统。

这里我给你提供了在 Arch Linux 中安装 Pantheon 桌面的指南和步骤。

警告： 第一次可能不顺利，所以我建议你在物理系统上安装前先在虚拟机上进行。因为在 Arch 中安装 Pantheon 并不像在 Arch Linux 中安装 GNOME、Xfce 和 KDE Plasma 桌面那样流畅。它还需要一些额外的手动配置。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Normally Linux has a better install experience than Windows (because it's faster and more drivers are included) but the only way I (or Dell support) could get a fresh (offline iso) Windows install onto a new Dell XPS 17 9720, was to install Linux and put Windows in KVM. Even using an Apple computer there are ways to get installer ISOs, but not on this Dell; unreliable online disk image driver hackery only. Windows would not even launch the installer or say what driver it wanted, just that it wanted it.
 Every time I help someone with Windows I'm reminded in multiple ways how nice Linux is.

 My parents are not computer literate. That translated into lots of regular issues with their Windows computers. When we made the switch to Linux, I had to show them where to click or how to navigate the GUI in a couple of cases or do some basic setup work, and field the occasional question.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[For other HN'ers out there who have personal projects on Heroku and might've forgotten (like I did), this weekend is the last chance to get data out of Heroku (or upgrade to paid plans) before it deletes databases/Redis and shuts down free dynos on Monday.
> What products are impacted by the removal of free plans?
>> `free` dynos, `hobby-dev` Heroku Postgres, and `hobby-dev` Heroku Data for Redis plans.
>> What happens if I take no action on my free apps or databases or do not upgrade to a paid plan?
>> If you take no action by November 28, 2022:
>> - `free` dynos will be converted to `eco` dynos scaled down to 0. You must subscribe to the Eco dyno hours plan or upgrade to another paid plan before you can scale them up again. Any Scheduler jobs that used free dynos will fail until they are reconfigured to use another dyno type.
> - For non-Enterprise users, `hobby-dev` databases will be deleted in accordance with the Heroku Documentation starting November 28, 2022.
> - For Enterprise users, `hobby-dev` databases that belong to an Enterprise Account or Team will be converted to `mini`. There will be no immediate change in cost to your Heroku Enterprise invoices if an app is upgraded from a free tier resource to a paid tier resource. Any changes to Heroku Enterprise pricing would require a contract update to take effect. If you have any concerns about your contract pricing, contact your account executive.
> - `hobby-dev` databases that belong to personal accounts will be deleted, and `free dynos` will be converted to `eco` dynos scaled down to 0, even if that user also belongs to an Enterprise Team. These users must upgrade to paid resources before November 28, 2022.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Western Digital latest Enterprise disks introduced a "technology" called OptiNAND. In their manual (pdf) they are not saying much about it (or at least I could not find anything) other than eg. the HC560 has 64GB flash on board, in their data sheet (pdf) I copy-pasted below what they are saying about it.
 My question if they are storing this so called "metadata" (whatever that is) on flash storage how would that affect full disk encryption security? Any concerns? Wonder how that even works if everything is encrypted on the disk. Or maybe this metadata is just a kind of "index table" of the sectors but has zero relevance of the sector content?
 For the sake of simplicity let's assume:
  
no intentional malicious code is on these HDDs' firmware
 dm-crypt full disk encryption (+LUKS)
 no known exploit in dm-crypt
 highly sensitive company data (so you are not hiding something from your girlfriend :D)
  
From their data sheet:
 "OptiNAND integrates an iNAND® Universal Flash Storage (UFS) Embedded Flash Drive (EFD) with traditional spinning disk media, and incorporates innovative changes to the firmware algorithm and system-on-a-chip (SoC). OptiNAND is not a hybrid technology*. The drive works smarter, with enhanced firmware algorithms taking advantage of* expanded metadata that has been offloaded to the iNAND*, enabling more tracks per inch (TPI), resulting in increased areal density. The Ultrastar DC HC560, with the first implementation of OptiNAND technology’s capacity-enabling features, delivers an unbeaten 20TB capacity in a nine-disk platform (2.2TB/platter) with CMR recording format."*

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Some time ago I wanted to give the aerc email client a try, but then I deleted it when I found out that it stores the password in plain text. But now I wonder, how do other applications store sensitive information like passwords? For example in KMail I only entered my password initially and the application stored it somewhere.
 The obvious solution is to store data encrypted, but how does the application decrypt it again? It would need some cryptographic key, but then we have just kicked the can down the road: the key itself needs to be either plain text or it needs to be encrypted again, which necessitates another key or a password.
 In this comment the author of aerc says that the config file must have permissions 600 (read+write for owner, nothing for rest of system), so it is not readable by the rest of the system. Is this what other applications do as well? A malicious application I have installed which has access to the file system could just read my settings and an attacker who gets physical access to my machine (e.g. a thief) could just hook up the hard drive to his computer and bypass and OS permissions. For the latter I would have to encrypt my hard drive, and for the former I guess I have to be careful what I run and not just trust "lol, the password is encrypted". Am I correct?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Folks, i'm so thankful to have come across linux by chance. Few years ago I purchased a Chromebook because I was broke and couldn't afford to replace windows laptop.
 I got tired of Chromebooks limitations so I looked around and came across crouton only few months ago. It began my journey of steep learning curve and may hours of frustrations.
 I persisted and ended up running various distros but settled on lubuntu. Works flawlessly on my Chromebook.
 I plan to buy a good laptop and install either Pop!Os or Mint.
 Biggest benefit for me - I struggle with hyperactivity and I'm easy distracted and overstimulated.
 Linux is basically like taking a ADHD medication for me - clutter free and no distratction. I love it.
 EDIT: btw watched and read about the development of GNU/Linux. Very interesting and I think Linus Torvalds is real deal.
 What tips do you have for an enthustiastic newbie?

谷歌称互联网的六成是重复内容

谷歌工程师 Gary Illyes 在一次演讲中称，互联网上六成的内容是重复的。但他没有对重复进行定义。互联网上有大量重复内容是众所周知的事实，问题是比例有多大，作为最大最流行的搜索引擎，谷歌给出了它的答案。


消息来源：SE Roundtable



老王点评：毕竟互联网的主要内容来自 ICP —— Internet Copy & Paste。🤣




Ubuntu Touch 发布新版本，但仍基于六年前的 Ubuntu

这个可以在智能手机和平板电脑上运行的 Linux 发行版推出了最新版本 OTA-24，继续支持来自华硕、谷歌、LG、一加、三星、索尼、小米和其他供应商的各种设备。这个版本继续基于 Ubuntu 16.04 LTS，向 Ubuntu 20.04 LTS 的过渡仍在进行。


消息来源：Phoronix



老王点评：能继续保持更新已属不易，过渡到新的 Ubuntu 版本确实需要很长时间。没有商业公司支持的开源项目，往往很难。]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[据华尔街日报中文网援引The Information报道称，Alphabet旗下的谷歌正在考虑裁员1万人，占其全球员工总数的6%。


报道指出，此举将基于一个排名系统，该系统将淘汰排名最低的“表现不佳”的员工。


报道还称，谷歌发言人在一份声明中表示，“今年早些时候，我们推出了谷歌评估和发展系统，以帮助员工获得全年的发展、辅导、学习和职业进步。这一新系统有助于建立明确的期望，并为员工提供定期反馈。”


另据美国消费者新闻与商业频道(CNBC)报道称，谷歌公司内部的焦虑情绪正在上升。


上述报道提到，谷歌的业务受到的打击并不像许多同行那样严重，但潜在的衰退、通胀飙升和利率上升的综合影响正在产生明显的影响。


此外，Alphabet的高管们近期还强调，公司需要更专注，降低各种项目的成本，并使公司的效率提高20%。其首席执行官皮查伊曾表示，“显而易见的是，我们正面临着一个具有挑战性的宏观环境，未来将有更多的不确定性。”


Alphabet的净利也在下降。三季报显示，其第三季营收为690.9亿美元，低于市场预期的705.8亿美元，去年同期为651.2亿美元；净利润从去年同期的189.4亿美元大幅下滑至139.1亿美元。


近期，包括Meta、推特、亚马逊、Carvana、思科、Lyft和Stripe在内的科技公司都陷入了裁员风波，这影响了全球数以万计的工作岗位。


对此，华尔街日报分析指出，疫情开始后，随着用户的消费行为都转向线上，科技公司的收入和员工人数出现了爆发式增长。但如今，疫情红利逐渐消退，科技巨头们不得不裁减数以千计的员工。

远程桌面客户端允许你连接到任何其他桌面/服务器，并远程执行任务。它是一种重要的 IT 支持和商业用例。在 Linux 中，有许多远程桌面客户端可用。其中一些是免费的，而另一些是付费版本。所有这些客户端都支持流行的 远程桌面协议Remote Desktop Protocol（RDP），如 VNC、RDP 等等。

本文将介绍一些适用于 Ubuntu 和其他发行版的最佳免费远程桌面客户端。该列表包括自由开源的应用程序，以及一些免费使用但专有的应用程序。

注意：你的目标系统中需要一个远程桌面服务器（如 Xrdp）来成功建立远程连接。然后你才能使用以下应用程序进行连接。这是一个双向的过程。如果你想了解更多的情况，请参考我们的一个案例研究：

适用于 Linux 的最佳远程桌面客户端

GNOME Connections



第一个远程桌面客户端是一个原生的 GNOME 应用程序：GNOME 连接Connections 应用。这个基于 GTK 的应用程序带来了一个简单的用户界面。它是一个非常适合初学者的应用程序。它可以在一分钟内快速设置和连接（如果你知道 IP 和其他细节）。

此外，它还提供了清晰的指示，说明你是要连接到 Linux 还是 Windows。GNOME 连接应用支持 VNC（针对 Linux）和 RDP（针对 Windows）协议。

用 Flatpak 安装这个应用程序超级简单。设置你的系统以使用 Flatpak，并使用以下命令进行安装：

flatpak install flathub org.gnome.Connections

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A little bit of background. 
 Some years ago, Ubuntu had Amazon integration with Unity’s search feature. This caused quite an uproar in the Linux community with the eventual removal of Amazon (at least from what I am aware, I apologize if I am wrong). 
 The Amazon integration should never happened due to Amazon’s war on privacy with them being arguably the least privacy-friendly company in existence. For Ubuntu to even think it was a good idea for the integration is an insult and a disconnect to the entire Linux community and what most Linux users try to go for. 
 Next they created the Snap store. Although the store is open source (100% a plus!), they have forced the proprietorship of the store, meaning that in order to get software on the snap store, you MUST go through Ubuntu. This is, again, an unpopular view with the community, with some popular distros, such as Linux Mint, disabling the store by default. 
 By these continuous decisions that are so disconnected from what a lot, if not most, Linux users want and are looking for when ditching Microsoft and Apple, and especially the past integration with Amazon, I feel that Ubuntu should not be listed as a trustworthy distro when it comes to privacy. 
 Now I’m not looking to specifically shit on Ubuntu and Canonical, moreoverso, I’m trying to get other views from the community and those who have chosen to stick it out with Ubuntu and why considering their recent anti-community practices. 
 Please this post was made in good faith, and I have used Ubuntu before (mostly Kubuntu KDE for the win) and I’m just looking for Ubuntu users (or Ubuntu spins users) with their opinions on Canonical and their past. 
 Thank you in advance and if this breaks the rules, please mods delete :)

        <id>https://linux.cn/article-15290-1.html?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss</id>
        <link href="https://linux.cn/article-15290-1.html?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss"/>
        <updated>2022-11-26T01:56:57.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Fedora Silverblue 是 基于 Fedora Linux 构建的桌面操作系统。它非常适合日常使用、开发和基于容器的工作流程。它提供了 众多优势，例如能够在出现任何问题时回滚。如果你想在 Fedora Silverblue 系统上更新或变基到 Fedora Linux 37（这些说明与 Fedora Kinoite 类似），本文将告诉你如何操作。它不仅向你展示了该做什么，而且还向你展示了在发生不可预见的事情时如何恢复。

在实际对 Fedora Linux 37 进行变基之前，你应该应用任何待定的更新。在终端中输入以下内容：

$ rpm-ostree update


或通过 GNOME 软件Software 应用安装更新并重新启动。

使用 GNOME 软件应用变基

在更新页面上，GNOME 软件Software 应用向你显示有新版本的 Fedora Linux 可用。



你需要做的第一件事是下载新镜像，因此请点击“下载Download”按钮。这需要一些时间。完成后，你将看到更新已准备好安装。



点击 “重启并更新Restart & Upgrade” 按钮。此步骤只需要几分钟，最后计算机将重启。重启后，你将获得全新的 Fedora Linux 37 版本。很简单，不是吗？

使用终端变基

如果你喜欢在终端中完成所有操作，那么本指南的这一部分适合你。

使用终端变基到 Fedora Linux 37 很容易。首先，检查 37 分支是否可用：

$ ostree remote refs fedora


你应该在输出中看到以下内容：

fedora:fedora/37/x86_64/silverblue


如果你想置顶当前部署（该部署将作为 GRUB 中的选项保留，直到你删除它），你可以通过运行以下命令来完成：

# 0 is entry position in rpm-ostree status
$ sudo ostree admin pin 0


要删除置顶部署，请使用以下命令：

# 2 is entry position in rpm-ostree status
$ sudo ostree admin pin --unpin 2


其中 2 是 rpm-ostree 状态中的位置。

接下来，将你的系统重新设置为 Fedora Linux 37 分支。

$ rpm-ostree rebase fedora:fedora/37/x86_64/silverblue


最后，要做的最后一件事是重新启动计算机并引导至 Fedora Linux 37。

如何回滚

如果发生任何不好的事情，例如，如果你根本无法启动到 Fedora Linux 37，这很容易回滚。在引导时选择 GRUB 菜单中的上一个条目（如果你没有看到它，请尝试在引导过程中按 ESC），你的系统将以切换到 Fedora Linux 37 之前的先前状态启动。要使此更改永久生效，请使用以下命令：

$ rpm-ostree rollback


就是这样。现在你知道如何将 Fedora Silverblue 变基到 Fedora Linux 37 并回滚。那么为什么不在今天做呢？

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[当地时间周五（11月25日），美国联邦通信委员会（FCC）宣布，禁止华为、中兴通讯、海康威视、海能达和浙江大华五家公司在美国销售设备。


FCC称这五家的产品“对美国国家安全构成不可接受的风险”。FCC此举的依据是其于2019年颁布的一项旨在保护美国通信网络安全的法律。


早在FCC做出这一决定之前，华为、中兴通讯、海康威视、海能达和浙江大华五家公司就已被列入所谓“对美国国家安全造成威胁的安全风险”清单，进入清单的公司被认定对美国国家通信安全构成威胁。除了上述五家公司外，中国移动、中国电信和中国联通也被列入了该清单。


去年由拜登政府正式把安全装置法签署生效之后，FCC联邦通信委员会在全票通过之后，于今天正式引用条文禁止多家中国企业的电讯和视像监控产品获得认证，换句话说就是要在当地禁售今后的产品，当中点名华为、中兴、大华、海康威视（Hikvision）和海能达（Hytera）。


FCC主席Jessica Rosenworcel在新闻稿中提到，他们的行动是为了保护美国国家安全，拒绝境内出现不被信任的通讯装置，特别是使用联邦基金的地方。 Rosenworcel提到会寻求重新审视，甚至是撤销涵盖名单（covered list）上产品的进网准许。


今年3月，FCC将中国电信美洲公司和中国移动国际（美国）有限公司列入“对美国国家安全造成威胁的安全风险”清单。


今年9月20日，FCC再次将中国联通美洲运营有限公司与中资电信企业太平洋网络有限公司及其全资子公司信通列入上述清单。

这个名为 Pitchfork 的秘密项目现已转到谷歌实验室，旨在 “教代码自己编写代码和重写”。Pitchfork 能够通过机器学习技术训练 AI 编写代码、修复 Bug，以及更新代码。其最初目标是构建一款工具，可以将谷歌的 Python 编程语言代码库更新到较新的版本。但随着时间的推移，该项目的目标转向了一个通用系统：可以减少人类开发者编写和更新代码的需要，同时又能保持代码质量。

谷歌安全团队称谷歌等安卓手机厂商迟迟没有修补漏洞

谷歌的 Project Zero 团队说，他们在 6、7 月间发现了 5 个新问题，并告知了 ARM 公司。ARM 在 7、8 月间发布了修复程序。然而，在三个月后，包括三星、小米、Oppo 和谷歌在内的智能手机制造商还没有部署补丁来修复这些漏洞。这些漏洞可以使恶意黑客绕过安卓系统的权限模型，获得对系统的完全访问权。

GitHub 正在测试在 Markdown 中嵌入 JavaScript

GitHub 正在内测在其仓库内的 Markdown 文件内嵌入 JavaScript 代码，这被称之为 “GitHub Blocks”。Markdown 通常用来做代码仓库的说明和文档。通过嵌入 JavaScript，调用 GitHub 提供的 RESTful API，可以使 Markdown 文件变成动态的。它的用例包括渲染字体和颜色，在格式化的表格中显示 JSON 数据，显示仓库分析，如贡献者、问题统计、提交和拉动请求，显示图表，以及动态演示应用功能。

老王点评：这样就把 Markdown 变成富文本的，动态的了，是不是和 Markdown 本身的初衷背道而驰了？]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[我们列出了 2022 年适用于 Linux 和 Windows 的六个最佳 Python 代码编辑器。


如今，Python 无处不在，它可以说是现代版的 C 语言编程语言。从网站、应用程序、数据科学项目、人工智能到物联网设备，你可以发现 Python 无处不在。因此，作为这十年来流行的编程语言，了解 Python 的开发环境是很有必要的，开发人员用它创建应用程序，特别是如果你是刚刚开始学习 Python 编程，更需要了解 Python 开发环境。

许多 Python 开发环境都提供了可以满足你需求的功能和工具。其中有些环境对学习 Python 的初学者很有用，而另外一些用户则适用于重型 Python 开发和复杂的设置。在这里，在这篇文章中，我将谈一谈其中最好的几个，这将有助于你根据自己的需要和使用情况选择一个。

最好的 Python 编码编辑器

这个榜单上有以下几个编辑器：


Visual Studio Code

Eclipse

PyCharm

Spyder

Sublime Text

Thonny


1、Visual Studio Code



尽管它是微软创造的，但 Visual Studio Code 是最好的代码编辑器之一。不仅是 Python，对于所有流行和趋势的编程语言都是。

它具有语法高亮、代码补完、调试、代码片段、内置 Git 等诸如此类的功能。对于新手来说，它有点复杂，但也只需几个小时就能学会。

然而，它是用 Electron 框架构建的，可能会感觉稍微慢一些。但在高端的开发硬件下这不是问题。它是一个自由开源的应用程序，适用于 Linux、macOS 和 Windows。

以下是适用于 Ubuntu、Fedora 和相关发行版的单个 deb 和 RPM 包：

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[这是有关如何在 Oracle VirtualBox 中启用 USB 的指南。




当你在虚拟机环境中工作时，USB 通常插入主机系统。但是从客体系统访问 USB 内容有点困难。

在 VirtualBox 中，你需要安装一些扩展并启用一些设置才能访问 USB。方法如下。

本文假设你已经安装了 VirtualBox，并且还在其中安装了一些 Linux 发行版或操作系统。

如果没有，请查看 这篇文章。


请注意，Oracle VM VirtualBox 扩展包采用 Oracle 的个人使用和评估许可证（PUEL）。该许可证与 VirtualBox 不同，后者采用的是 GPL。如果你将下面的步骤用于商业目的，请确保你仔细阅读 本页面。


在 VirtualBox 7.0 中启用 USB

安装 VirtualBox 扩展包

打开 VirtualBox 下载页面并从 此链接 下载适用于所有支持平台的 VirtualBox 扩展包。



然后单击 “文件File > 工具Tools > 扩展包管理器Extension Pack Manager”。

单击工具栏中的 “安装Install” 按钮并选择下载的 .vbox-extpak 文件。

点击 “安装Install”。接受条款，并为安装提供管理员密码。





安装成功后，可以在已安装列表中看到。

重启主机系统。重启是强制性的。

在客体机中启用 USB

将 U 盘插入你的宿主机系统，你希望从虚拟机中访问该系统。

启动 VirtualBox 并右键单击要启用 USB 的虚拟机名称。选择“设置Settings”。



在左窗格中，单击 USB。然后选择控制器版本。例如，你可以选择 USB 3.0。然后单击小加号图标添加 USB 过滤器。

在此列表中，你应该看到你的 U 盘名称（你插入的）。对于这个例子，我可以看到我插入的 Transcend Jetflash 驱动器。

选择它并按 “OK”。



现在，启动你的虚拟机。打开文件管理器，你应该会看到 U 盘已启用并挂载到你的虚拟机上。

在此演示中，你可以看到我的 Arch-Xfce 虚拟机的 Thunar 文件管理器正在显示我的 U 盘中的内容。



使用说明

现在，这里有几件事你应该记住。

当你在主机系统中插入 U 盘时，请保持挂载状态。但在启动虚拟机之前不要打开或访问任何文件。

启动虚拟机后，U 盘将在主机系统中卸载并自动挂载到客体系统中，即你的虚拟机。

使用完 U 盘后，确保在虚拟机中将其弹出或卸载。然后它将能再从你的主机系统内访问。

总结

VirtualBox 是一个功能强大的程序，提供易于使用的功能来设置的你虚拟机。这些步骤很简单，并确保你的 U 盘在主机系统中被正确检测到以正常工作。

另外，请记住，通过扩展包检测 U 盘与 VirtualBox 客户端增强包无关。它们完全不相关并提供独立的功能。

最后，如果本指南对你有帮助，请在评论栏中告诉我。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I operate multiple apps which were providing my entire livelihood, and I wake up one day to realize it's all gone.
Long story short, Google froze my Google Pay account which is used to pay for anything related to Google services, including GCP. This was done as they need to temporarily suspend me to 'verify' me. The GCP team couldn't help me since it was an issue with Google Pay. Not to mention their chat support is useless and doesn't have any power to look into cases.
Now I login to find out my Google Pay account is 'temporarily suspended' since I need to verify my account. I go ahead and add my drivers license and fill out their form, but while they verify details they suspend your ability to pay for any Google services.
So now I can't pay for GCP usage (firebase) and all my authentication, database, cloud functions, are all not usable since the service is suspended. Unlike Amazon who offers phone lines for resolving billing issues, Google does no such thing. I wish I chose AWS.
The end result is that I have apps I spent years of my life building and which currently feed me to only be rendered unusable because some AI at google thought my Google Pay needed additional verification.
My whole life has done a 180 in the past week. I feel like I'm a man with literally nothing to lose and I can't live with myself anymore. This hurts much more than losing a job for me.
Please stay far, far away from Google services of any kind. They are by far the worst of the big tech companies when it comes to developer support.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I wanted to see how difficult it would be to build a web app using a sub-$300 android smartphone. Decided to build a fun predictions website where you could bet virtual (not real) money on predictions made by others, and also make predictions of your own.
Building it turned out to be considerably easier and more fun than I anticipated.
Primary tools used were:
# QuickEdit as the mobile code editor (Note: the free version of the QuickEdit app is riddled with ads, it shows an advert each time you close a tab, but it unfortunately had the best UI of the 3 or so Android code editors I tested. Ended up using NetGuard to block it from retrieving & displaying ads),
# PHP for the Backend ( custom PHP microframework I've used and built on over the past few years ).
# jQuery for the frontend js (cringing) - it appears I'm simply too lazy to learn React/Vue/et al. Every once in a while, I pick one of them to learn, but I always end up returning to jQuery - or time-permitting - amateur level vanilla JS.
# Bootstrap for the CSS - Battle-tested. For a purely backend dev with minimal design skills, good ol' Bootstrap (and in a growing number of cases, Tailwind) is always a life saver.
# Whole thing is hosted on 2 VMs (1 hosting the web app, and 1 hosting Redis & MySQL).
# As to the site itself, it turned out to be pretty cool to play around with. Go there, view the predictions, bet on the predictions you believe will come true, or against the ones you think will not. You get $50,000 to bet with (not real money). No signup is required to bet, but a quick signup is required to make a prediction. Hope you guys like it, and please be ruthless in telling me of any bugs you've found.
So go on here => kudotap.com
And Have Fun!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Thanks in advance. I’m at the point of liking Linux and being comfortable enough with it to use as daily driver but I’m missing some 3rd party software I would need before I could completely give up on Mac OS. QuickBooks for my business accounting and Quicken for home finances are not available for Linux. What alternatives would you recommend? 
 Another is a calendar app which syncs with iCal calendar, which I believe uses the CalDAV protocol? Really if there are desktop apps that work with iCloud for calendar, notes, email, contacts, and messaging that would be amazing so I don’t have to rely on Google. I’m not skilled enough to get NextCloud working.

 I was in need of some screenshot software beyond the default mate-screenshot I have on Linux Mint and I decided to research a couple options. My goal is to be able to take screen-grabs without too much “fuzz” and paste them into a document I’m writing (e.g. into an email). At the same time, I want the option to add annotations to some of my screenshots. The two tools I decided to look into are Flameshot and Shutter.
 Flameshot
 Once you run it, it gets added to the system tray:

 When you click the icon, an intuitive dark overlay covers the screen but it also includes reminder on how to use the most common functions of the tool:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've played around with Linux before but never daily drove it cause I felt like it was too much of a pain with little gain to switch over, but a few days ago I decided to just try it properly once and for all. I partitioned a small 64GB on my laptop and daily drove it, and holy shit, its so good! I can customize it so much, boot time is noticeably faster and it runs most of my apps well. And the main part is that the OS is instantly usable as soon as it loads in, unlike Windows where I have to give it a few seconds for everything to settle down first. Linux is just underrated. 
 I dont know if this belongs here. But I am genuinely surprised big time by how good Linux is. Its honestly a no bullshit OS which I've been looking for all my life.

For example why not to create crowdfunding to pay someone to make a fractional scaling for gnome (then of course it will be curated by GNOME Project), or any other problem that i just cannot recall. Basically same as donation, but users know for sure where their money goes.
 I dont think that i am the first person thinked about it, so does anyone knows why no one did this before?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[哪些是最基本的 Linux 的命令？

经常有读者问我这个问题，我一直试图避免回答这个问题。

为什么呢？我不知道 Linux 命令吗？不是的。这不是原因。而是因为很难对它们进行分类。对我来说必不可少的东西对你来说可能并不重要。

但我想这适用于所有的东西，我们网站上的每一个这样的推荐应用程序列表也都是这样。

这就是为什么我最终放弃了，并创建了这个基本但重要的 Linux 命令列表，它应该对作为 Linux 用户的你有所帮助。这更多的是针对 Ubuntu 这样的桌面用户，但如果你把 Ubuntu 作为服务器使用，它们也应该对你有所帮助。

Linux 的基本命令

我在这里列出的每个命令都有多个选项和多种用途。如果我尝试给出每个命令的最常见的例子，它将很容易变成一本超过一万字的口袋书。

我不会详述这些命令中的任何一个。我将列出每个命令的目的及其基本语法。你可以从这些命令的链接教程中阅读更多关于使用这些命令的信息。

在你开始阅读列表之前推荐阅读：


Linux 中路径的概念

文件权限的概念

了解 Linux 终端的行话


还有一件事。我在这里更多地使用了文件夹这个术语，而不是目录。

在 Linux 中文件夹被称为目录，有些人可能不喜欢这样。然而，我相信对于初学者来说，这更容易掌握。

1、ls 命令：列出一个文件夹的内容

这是一个新的 Linux 用户最先学会的几个命令之一。这个命令可以让你看到当前文件夹里有哪些文件和文件夹。

ls


你可以使用长列表选项 ls -l 来查看细节，如文件大小、权限、修改时间等。如果你想，你可以对这些选项进行排序和控制。

ls -l

ls 命令示例


2、cd 命令：改变目录

默认情况下，你从你的主目录下开始。你经常需要改变目录并移动到…]]></summary>

老王点评：订阅制汽车，以后或许生活中所有主要家电都要付费使用，像付电费一样。




攻击者利用数十年前的软件入侵电网

微软警告说，恶意黑客正在利用常见的物联网设备中发现的一个已停用的 Boa Web 服务器来攻击能源领域。在 Boa Web 服务器中发现了一个易受攻击的开源组件，尽管该软件于 2005 年退役，但仍被广泛用于一系列路由器和安全摄像头，以及流行的软件开发工具包。微软表示，在一周的时间里，它已经在全球范围内发现了 100 万个暴露在互联网上的 Boa 服务器组件。

老王点评：遗留的旧软件带来的问题，对无法更新的 IoT 设备是巨大的隐患，这都是历史欠账。




旧金山警方申请部署武装机器人

旧金山警察局目前正在向该市监事会提出申请，要求允许部署机器人来杀死执法部门认为有足够威胁的嫌疑人。警方称，“可能会出现部署致命武力是唯一选择的情况”。这项提案已经遭到了监事会内外的巨大反对。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[微软计划在2023年2月将旗下Internet Explorer 11（简称IE11）网络浏览器在某些Windows系统中禁用。微软计划通过2023年2月累积安全更新在Windows 10系统上永久禁用IE11，这样以后就不能再重新激活和使用了。


目前除了Windows10，IE11也可以在早期版本的Windows上使用，但Windows 7 ESU和Windows 8.1扩展系统最终将在2023年1月结束支持。在停止支持它们后，微软将集中精力处理Windows 10系统相关事宜。


微软已经在网站和Microsoft365管理中心确认了该决定。


“作为计划于2023年2月14日发布的2023年2月Windows安全更新(“B”)的一部分，某些版本的Windows 10将永久禁用已停用的、不支持的Internet Explorer 11(IE11)桌面应用程序。强烈建议在此日期之前在Microsoft Edge中设置IE模式并禁用IE11，以确保你的组织不会遇到业务中断。”


据微软称，以后任何对IE11的调用都将自动重定向到Microsoft Edge网页浏览器。


IT之家获悉，IE11的支持在2022年6月15日结束，第一阶段的退役开始。在该阶段，IE11仍然保留在系统上，但对IE的调用被重定向到Microsoft Edge。第二阶段将从系统中卸载IE11的组件，但微软直到现在也没有提供截止日期。


微软计划在2023年1月17日为Windows 10和Windows 11发布可选更新；该可选的非安全更新将从Windows设备上删除安装的IE11。然后，在2023年2月14日，IE浏览器将作为2月补丁日的一部分被自动删除。可选的更新会提前删除组件，但补丁日的更新将在所有支持的系统上删除。


微软在Microsoft Edge中创建了IE模式，为组织和家庭用户提供了加载需要Internet Explorer技术内容的选项。特别是组织可能操作需要某些Internet Explorer技术的内容。Edge中的IE模式就是为了加载这些内容而设计的。


删除IE11不会从Windows系统中删除该浏览器的所有组件。虽然它不能再运行，但IE的一些组件可能仍然被操作系统上的程序所需要。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Audacity 是一个自由开源的跨平台 音频编辑器。专业人士使用它是因为它提供的功能仅需安装很小的软件包。

你不必成为一名专业人士并使用它的所有功能。你可以使用它从麦克风录制音频，并执行一些基本操作，如背景噪声消除。

我将在本教程中向你展示如何做到这一点。

在 Linux 上安装 Audacity

在 Linux 上安装 Audacity 是一个非常简单的过程。由于其受欢迎，可以在大多数 Linux 发行版的官方存储库中找到它。

你可以在发行版的软件中心或软件包管理器中搜索它。

作为一个终端爱好者，让我分享一下常见发行版的命令。

对于基于 Debian 或 Ubuntu 的发行版：

sudo apt install audacity


对于基于 RHEL 或 Fedora 的发行版：

sudo dnf install audacity


如果你在用基于 Arch 的发行版：

sudo pacman -Syu audacity


注意，通过官方存储库安装可能无法获得 最新版本。要获得最新版本，你可以使用 AppImage 或 Flatpak/Snap 软件包。

使用 Audacity 录制音频

安装 Audacity 后，从应用程序菜单打开它或从终端启动它。你会看到这样的界面：



单击“录制”按钮（红点）即可轻松开始录制。完成后，单击“ 停止”按钮（方形图标）来结束录制。你还可以预览录制的波形，如下所示：



然后，你可以通过单击“播放”按钮（绿色图标）检查录制的内容。

如果你没有看到任何波形，则表示未录制到任何内容。很可能，你没有正确设置音频输入。确保你选择了正确的麦克风，并确保在“系统设置system settings”中其未被静音。你也可以通过 Audacity 接口设置。

录音不会自动保存为 MP3 或其他格式。要保存录音，你可以转到 “文件File → 导出Export” 并选择 “导出为 MP3Export as MP3”（或任何其他想要的格式）。

使用 Audacity 降低背景噪声

Audacity 还有另一个很棒的功能，你可以使用它来减少录制音频中的白噪声。

最好的做法是在开始使用 Audacity 录制时的前五秒不要说任何话。这将为你提供所需的背景噪声。

在录制音频的波形上，选择你认为是背景噪声的部分。



选择噪声部分后，从顶部文件菜单中转到 “效果Effects → 降低噪音Noise Reduction”。

它会像这样打开一个弹出窗口。单击此处的 “获取噪音配置文件Get Noise Profile”。



现在，你已经设置了噪声配置文件。现在，你必须使用它来减少录音中的噪声。

按 Ctrl + A 快捷键选择整段录音。你也可以选择其中的一部分，仅对所选部分减少噪声。

选择音轨后，再次转到 “效果Effects → 降低噪音Noise Reduction”。

这次不要单击 “获取噪音配置文件Get Noise Profile”。这一次，你应该能够按下 “OK” 按钮。

只需按下 “OK” 按钮，即可将降噪效果应用到录音中，并反映在波形上，如下所示：



现在，相较而言，录制的音频将具有更少的噪声。你可以在选择 “降低噪音Noise Reduction” 效果时微调噪声过滤。

总结如下：


选择噪声部分，转到 “效果Effects → 降低噪音Noise Reduction”，然后单击 “获取噪音配置文件Get Noise Profile”

按 Ctrl + A 选择整段音频录制，转到 “效果Effects → 降低噪音Noise Reduction”，这次按 OK 按钮


请注意，你无法移除所有类型的噪声，但这应该会有所帮助。

Audacity 能做更多事情

使用 Audacity 录制音频可能不像使用 GNOME 录音机那样简单，但它并不太复杂。如果你正在录制画外音，降噪功能将非常有用。

Audacity 有更多其他功能，不可能在一个教程中涵盖所有这些功能。这就是为什么我会保持简短的原因。

如果你不能接受 2021 年的 Audacity 的隐私政策调整，试试其他可用的工具。

我希望这个小教程能帮助你使用 Audacity 进行音频录制。如果你有问题或建议，请告诉我。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[以下是如何在 Ubuntu 和其他 Linux 发行版中安装 LibreOffice Base 数据库模块。


流行的自由开源的办公套件 LibreOffice 由六个独立的组件组成。然而，Ubuntu 和相关发行版中默认安装的 LibreOffice 只包括其中的五个：


Calc

Writer

Impress

Draw

Math


由于某些原因，数据库模块 LibreOffice Base 没有被包括在内。所以，这里告诉你如何在 Ubuntu 和其他发行版中单独安装它。

在 Ubuntu 和其他 Linux 中安装 LibreOffice Base

你可以使用 “软件Software” 应用或终端来安装 libreoffic-base 包。我建议使用终端来安装它。打开一个终端窗口，运行以下命令来安装它。

sudo apt install libreoffice-base


如果你喜欢 “软件Software” 应用 或其他基于 GUI 的安装程序，搜索 “libreoffic-base” 并点击安装。

对于 Fedora 和基于 RPM 的发行版，使用以下命令：

sudo dnf install libreoffice-base


如果你在 Arch Linux 中安装了 LibreOffice，无论是 libreoffic-fresh 还是 libreoffic-still，那么就不需要任何操作了。LibreOffice Base 已经包含在这两个软件包中了。你可以开始使用了。

在另一个方面，如果你想看看如何安装最新的 LibreOffice，请查看 这个指南。



最后，安装完毕后，你可以在应用菜单中找出 LibreOffice Base。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Been wondering for a while, if I would have any problems with daily tasks, although, I have always liked using Linux. It's been 2 days since the install and all work/study related tasks are actually easier to do for now, considering the fact that I am running the web app when I have to use Microsoft Word. What do you guys think about Ubuntu?
 I have been thinking about Fedora as well. Seems like it's worth it to try it out. Would appreciate it, if you guys drop some comparison topics in the comments.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I presume that the Linux kernel has some automated testing in place. I am curious to know the logistics behind testing that requires a specific hardware. For example, a hardware driver for a specific printer (or anything, really). 
 Does Linux kernel have a distributed approach to testing, where people that own specific hardware test each pre-release on their hardware (I assume that would be really unlikely)? Do they do mock testing? I am thinking of the scale of the kernel and the number of hardware supported out-of-the-box, and how easily it would be for things to go wrong with a bad change, so I imagine that testing is really important.
 I am thinking more of changes to the kernel core that could break modules than changes to modules. I imagine when changes to modules are made for specific hardware, the contributor has responsibility to at least test before they submit their patch.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I took a minute (a few hours) to prepare a PPA for some deb packages I have been building for awhile, and let me tell you, there are about a billion ways that can break that I don't want to support. Let's put it this way -- it wasn't exactly fun. There were a few missteps. And I'm not certain I won't break it on the next update. Updating automatically is a chore, and isn't done yet, because I don't understand GitHub Actions.
 After all this I thought, why doesn't someone do this for me? After all my software works for me. I mean -- deb packages are great, but I don't really need a deb package built for me, and a PPA to deliver it to my door. This is mostly something I'm doing to help someone else.
 And my goodness how much digital ink has been spilled in r/linux and r/ubuntu regarding how much people hate Snaps. Given the grassroots support, you'd think there would be a group of folks just constantly building native Linux deb packages for other folks because of how easy it is (for them, not for me obviously). A concierge service if you will. 
 Wait a minute! Why isn't there a group that does nothing but build and distribute all native Linux packages? Because I want to support the entire archipelago of Linux systems for goodness sakes! If it's so easy (for them obviously, not me) to turn around a package and a repo, if thats what the Linux Desktop Users are demanding, why is this not a thing?! Obviously, it's super important. They talk about it all the time. And these people that talk and talk would be lining up to do something about the scourge of non-native packages.
 So I think this is (finally) one of those bright ideas and I wanted to share it with you. I think I am ready for someone else to literally build me a world without Snaps/Flatpak/AppImage.

 I have been working on creating my own KDE based Alpine Desktop, originally intended for use on my laptop, but possibly now as a persistent USB... It's been a journey - but I think it's going to be worth it in the long run. 
 I would like to know what others think about using Alpine as a daily desktop - I know it's not what the OS is developed or intended for, but I've always felt that it could be made into a good lightweight alternative to the available linux desktops. 
 Anyone else using Alpine as a desktop?
 Any thoughts on it? Would this seem like a pipe dream or a worthwhile endeavor?
 Thanks. 😊🙃

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey everyone!
In the last months I've been working on Unclutter, a modern reader mode browser extension. In contrast to all existing approaches, it unclutters articles by modifying their CSS instead of extracting the text content.
This results in a more visually pleasing result that reuses the original article style. The idea is to remove friction so you use the reader mode more often.
There are a few more features around saving articles automatically and taking highlights -- more details are on the website.
The extension has about 400 active weekly users right now, mostly from organic web store traffic. Monetisation has proven to be hard and for freemium there would need to be much higher numbers anyways.
Do you think I should keep working on the project?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[据华尔街日报中文网援引The Information报道称，Alphabet旗下的谷歌正在考虑裁员1万人，占其全球员工总数的6%。


报道指出，此举将基于一个排名系统，该系统将淘汰排名最低的“表现不佳”的员工。


报道还称，谷歌发言人在一份声明中表示，“今年早些时候，我们推出了谷歌评估和发展系统，以帮助员工获得全年的发展、辅导、学习和职业进步。这一新系统有助于建立明确的期望，并为员工提供定期反馈。”


另据美国消费者新闻与商业频道(CNBC)报道称，谷歌公司内部的焦虑情绪正在上升。


上述报道提到，谷歌的业务受到的打击并不像许多同行那样严重，但潜在的衰退、通胀飙升和利率上升的综合影响正在产生明显的影响。


此外，Alphabet的高管们近期还强调，公司需要更专注，降低各种项目的成本，并使公司的效率提高20%。其首席执行官皮查伊曾表示，“显而易见的是，我们正面临着一个具有挑战性的宏观环境，未来将有更多的不确定性。”


Alphabet的净利也在下降。三季报显示，其第三季营收为690.9亿美元，低于市场预期的705.8亿美元，去年同期为651.2亿美元；净利润从去年同期的189.4亿美元大幅下滑至139.1亿美元。


近期，包括Meta、推特、亚马逊、Carvana、思科、Lyft和Stripe在内的科技公司都陷入了裁员风波，这影响了全球数以万计的工作岗位。


对此，华尔街日报分析指出，疫情开始后，随着用户的消费行为都转向线上，科技公司的收入和员工人数出现了爆发式增长。但如今，疫情红利逐渐消退，科技巨头们不得不裁减数以千计的员工。

我经常使用程序坞。在本文中，我将分享一些关于有效使用程序坞的小技巧，并介绍自定义程序坞的外观和位置的方法。

你将在本教程中学习到以下内容：


程序坞的基本用途：添加应用程序，并使用快捷方式来启动应用程序

自定义程序坞的外观：更改图标大小、图标位置

更改程序坞的位置：可用于单屏和多显示器的设置

在程序坞中隐藏已安装的磁盘图标

自动隐藏或禁用程序坞

使用 dconf-editor 对程序坞进行额外的定制

用其他程序坞应用程序替换 Ubuntu 默认的程序坞


我将在教程中使用 程序坞dock、面板panel和 启动器launcher 等术语，它们的意思是等同的。

如何使用 Ubuntu 程序坞：你必须知道的基础知识

如果你是 Ubuntu 的新手，你需要掌握如何使用程序坞。尽管，在一段时间后你总会熟悉程序坞的功能，但是阅读本文能让你更快地明白。

向程序坞添加新的应用程序（或删除应用程序）

这一步骤十分简单。从菜单中搜索你想要添加在程序坞的应用程序，然后运行它。

正在运行的应用程序会显示在程序坞中，它的图标在程序坞中所有图标的下方。右键单击该图标，然后选择 “添加到收藏夹Add to Favorites” 选项。这会把该应用程序的图标锁定到程序坞上。



从程序坞中删除应用程序的图标，操作起来更为简单。你不需要运行你想要在程序坞删除的应用程序，只需右键单击应用程序图标，然后选择 “从收藏夹中删除Remove From Favorites” 即可。



更改程序坞中的图标顺序

默认情况下，新添加到程序坞…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[以下是你如何在 Debian、Ubuntu 和其他发行版中修复 “sudo command not found” 错误的方法。


有时，当你第一次设置或安装 Linux 发行版 时，你在用 sudo 尝试一些命令时，会出现 “sudo command not found” 的错误。

sudo 命令是 “superuser do” 的缩写，它是一个允许用户以管理员权限执行命令的程序。sudo 命令帮助你像管理员用户一样运行程序/命令。

此外，用 sudo 运行命令的用户必须是 sudo 组的一部分。

你看到这个错误的主要原因是该软件包本身没有安装。然而，大多数现代 Linux 发行版都默认提供了这个功能，但有些则没有。

下面是解决这个问题需要遵循的步骤。

故障排除 #1

首先，安装 sudo 包来解决这个问题。打开一个终端，刷新你的系统，并运行以下命令来安装 sudo。

对于 Ubuntu、Debian 和相关发行版：

su -apt updateapt install sudo


对于 Arch Linux：

pacman -S sudo


对于 Fedora、RHEL 等：

su -dnf updatednf install sudo


上述安装完成后，你必须使用以下命令将用户添加到 sudo 组中。

usermod -aG sudo <yourusername>


然后从终端运行 visudo，并运行以下行。按 CTRL+O 和 CTRL+X 来保存和退出。



退出并再次登录使变化生效。

故障排除 #2

在做了上述改变之后，如果你仍然收到错误信息，那么请按照以下步骤操作。

确保你的 $PATH 变量包含 sudo 可执行文件的正确路径。如果 sudo 已经安装，但 $PATH 不正确，你也会得到这个错误。理想情况下，你的路径应该包含以下所有的路径。

echo $PATH


/usr/local/bin:/usr/local/sbin:/usr/bin:/usr/sbin


要改变路径变量，使用以下命令。例如，如果 /usr/bin 不存在，那么你可以通过以下方式添加它。

export PATH=$PATH:/usr/bin


然后注销并登录查看效果。

总结

我希望这个指南能帮助你解决 Linux 发行版中的 sudo 错误。表面上的解决方案很简单，真的。

如果有帮助，或者如果你有任何问题，请在下面留言。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Just started using mpv and am impressed with the featureset and overall quality of the app. It's really quite good!
 ​
 Wanted to highlight something I really appreciated and don't see lots of other projects do: their keybindings example file!
 You can find the keybindings here: https://github.com/mpv-player/mpv/blob/master/etc/input.conf
 Snippet:
 ## Seek units are in seconds, but note that these are limited by keyframes #RIGHT seek 5 # seek 5 seconds forward #LEFT seek -5 # seek 5 seconds backward #UP seek 60 # seek 1 minute forward #DOWN seek -60 # seek 1 minute backward 
 This is exactly what I want out of apps in terms of keybindings documentation! They make the format obvious, there's a helpful inline comment, I'm not left guessing where I can find a list of functions to bind to. Really good! I hope more open source projects follow their example, I think one of the biggest pain points with new users is navigating sorta arcane config/bindings files.

 Any recommended book(s) to learn in-depth knowledge about the Kernel?
 I somehow finished undergrad without taking an OS course. (because of scheduling issues. trust me I wanted to take an OS class)
 Lately I've been trying to learn about how Docker works under the hood, and I'm grasping some of the concepts. But I need a book. I prefer reading literal paper pages over the endless CLI man pages.

In short its an IDE (VSCode/JetBrains) plugin that lets you share blocks of code that link directly to the code inside your IDE or repo. We use it all the time and think its pretty nifty tech that lets you understand someone’s code in context very quickly.  we’re hoping to keep refining it to make it better and more useful.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[For those who are waiting for Linux on Apple hardware, the Asahi Linux
project has put out a detailed
report on progress toward a working kernel and distribution.


	This kind of safety model is not new: it is already commonplace on
	Android phones, where it is usually implemented in DSP
	firmware. But of course, the desktop Linux ecosystem doesn’t even
	have a speaker EQ database framework yet, nevermind safety models!
	The eternal lagging behind of Linux audio strikes again. What’s the
	plan? While this isn’t settled yet, our current idea is to
	implement the safety model in a stand-alone daemon that captures
	the voltage/current feedback data from the ALSA device, and drives
	the mixer volume itself as as means of implementing soft power
	limits, together with some kind of “safety watchdog interlock” with
	the kernel that only enables higher volume limits when the daemon
	is active and running]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[11月22日，刘强东发布京东全员信。信中提到，为提高基层员工福利待遇，同时尽量减轻公司压力，集团决定自2023年1月1日起，京东集团副总监以上以及相对应的P/T序列以上全部高级管理人员，现金薪酬全部降低10%-20%不等，职位越高降得越多。


刘强东在邮件中表示，京东今天所有成功都离不开兄弟们的努力和坚持，在成功合并德邦之后，京东体系的员工总数已经突破了54万，相信未来京东可以为国家和社会直接带来超过100万就业岗位。


“德邦现有的员工，不管是外包还是自有的，都是我们的兄弟，自2023年1月1日起，逐步为十几万德邦的兄弟们缴齐五险一金，确保每个德邦兄弟都能‘老有所养，病有所医’，为兄弟们提供基础保障。过去，德邦的做法虽然合规合法，而且缴纳的五险一金比例远远超过其它同类公司，但依然有很多外包兄弟不能像自有员工一样享受全额五险一金待遇。我们会按照一定条件，逐步把外包兄弟转化为德邦自己的员工！让大家更有保障！”刘强东在信中表示。


目前，京东是行业内唯一一家与物流一线员工签订正式劳动合同并缴纳“五险一金”的公司，根据公开数据测算，2022年前三个季度，京东为一线员工的薪酬福利支出已超过330亿元。


“集团拿出100亿元人民币，为包括全体德邦兄弟们在内的所有集团基层员工设立‘住房保障基金’，我希望此举能为工作满五年以上全体员工，包括每一个快递兄弟和客服兄弟实现购房愿望。这是循环无息贷款基金，意味着未来十年，集团累积投入资金总额高达数百亿人民币。”刘强东在信中表示。


京东从自建物流之初就采用全职员工，与一线快递员签署劳动合同、缴纳五险一金，提供商业保险、通讯、防寒防暑、交通工具等多种福利及补贴。除了高于同行业平均水平的薪酬福利待遇之外，京东早在2012年就开始打造“安居计划”，向符合条件的员工提供最高100万的无抵押、无担保、无利息的资金支持，用于…]]></summary>

 I would like to install the video driver for my nvidia graphics card, that does best on power management. I found this old article comparing the power consummption of both nvidia and nouveau, but I do think it is quiet outdated:

 Now my question to you:
 Did anyone recently compare power consumption of proprietary nvidia driver, open nvidia driver and nouveau in a similar way?
 Thanks!

今年夏天，Ubuntu 为赛昉科技的昉・星光 RISC-V 单板计算机发布了官方镜像，而现在正在为即将发布的昉・星光 2 准备新的镜像。昉・星光 2 在几个月前宣布，将在年底陆续发货。它使用 SiFive 的 U74 四核 RISC-V SoC，运行频率高达 1.5GHz，有 2GB 到 8GB 的内存，双千兆以太网。除了 Ubuntu，他们还在努力支持多个 Linux 发行版。

老王点评：新的板子更强大，价格也不贵，我觉得树莓派并不一定是最好的选择了。




英伟达称融化的 RTX 4090 是因为电源线没插好

在英伟达宣布它正在调查关于其 RTX 4090 显卡的电源线融化和燃烧的报告数周后，他们认为大多是因为电源线没插好而导致急剧发热。4090 使用了使用新标准的电源连接器，因而需要专门的适配器。调查显示，这个适配器在设计上缺乏正确插入指示，因此没有完全插好的电源线会急剧发热，从而融毁电源线和 GPU 等设备。


消息来源：The Verge



老王点评：虽然可能是用户没插好，但是其实归根到底是产品设计不够好。




高性能计算越来越多采用液冷

随着 400W 的 CPU 和 700W 的 GPU 的出现，对这些部件的冷却已经不能风扇所能满足的了。本周在达拉斯举行的超级计算会议上，展示了一些冷却设备，其中将冷板连接到 CPU、GPU 上的直接式液冷可以散掉 80%-90% 的热量；也有一些采用浸入式液冷，整个设备浸入在冷却液中或在密闭的机箱中注满冷却液。报告称，预计到 2026 年，液体和浸入式冷却设备的支出将达到 11 亿美元，占热管理支出的 19%。


消息来源：The Register



老王点评：只能说现在的计算设备越来越热了。]]></summary>

https://blog.pimaker.at/texts/rvc1/ Risc V emulator in a shader
https://github.com/SCRN-VRC/SVM-Face-and-Object-Detection-Shader Object detection in a shader

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Kubernetes 的优势不仅在于它能够做什么，还在于知道它能为你做什么。




在 树莓派家庭实验室上运行 Kubernetes 的 5 个理由 这篇文章中，我解释了为什么推荐在家里使用 Kubernetes。其中的理由相对来说会有点随意，并且主要于关注结果。除了 Kubernetes 好用的功能之外，还有其他几个应将 Kubernetes 包含在你自己的计算机的理由。

（LCTT 译注：家庭实验室Homelab 指的是安置在你家里的一个服务器或者多服务器的组合配置。在之上托管了多个服务和虚拟系统，以此来进行测试、开发，或者提供家庭功能用途。）

1、Kubernetes 是基于 Linux 而建立的



Kubernetes 有很高的知名度。对于一些人来说，Kubernetes 是一种神秘技术，有一个不好念的名字；而对另一些人来说，Kubernetes 就好像是牧羊犬放牧羊群一样，可以帮助他们管理过多的容器；对于其它人来说，Kubernetes 是一种 云cloud 的操作系统，是 实效云开发effective cloud development 的一个有用的界面；对于大多数人来说，Kubernetes 可能是他们从未听说过的后端软件。正如人们所想的那样，Kubernetes 具有所有这些能力，甚至有更多的功能。

并非每个人都以相同的方式使用 Kubernetes，但如果你主要的工作是系统管理，你会发现 Kubernetes 只是又一个 Linux 命令。

我有一件 T 恤，上面写着 “容器就是 LinuxContainers are Linux”，它的意思是显而易见的。容器技术使用 cgroup，来运行包含一个或一组应用程序的最小 Linux 操作系统镜像。当你运行容器时，实际上你就是在运行 Linux。虽然 Kubernetes 能在许…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[在 Ubuntu 和其他 Linux 中安装最新的 LibreOffice 版本的快速指南。


自由开源的办公套件 LibreOffice 有两个版本：社区版和企业版。“社区” 版是为那些希望获得最新的尖端软件技术的早期采用者准备的。而 “企业” 版本更加稳定，可能不包括所有的最新功能，但它是生产环境和专业工作的理想选择。

在 Ubuntu 和其他 Linux 中安装最新的 LibreOffice

1、删除预安装的 LibreOffice

Ubuntu 和其他的 Linux 发行版带有预安装的 LibreOffice。这可能不是最新的，这是因为发行版有特定的发行周期。在进行新安装之前，你可以通过以下命令删除 Ubuntu 及其衍生发行版中的的旧版本。

打开一个终端并运行以下命令，以删除 Ubuntu 和相关发行版中的已安装的 LibreOffice。对于其他发行版，你可以使用发行版的软件包管理器将其删除。

sudo apt remove –purge libreoffice*
sudo apt autoclean
sudo apt autoremove


然后重启以确保一切正常（尽管你也可以跳过这一步）。

2、从网站上下载安装

前往 官方下载页面. 并通过从下拉菜单中选择类型下载 “最新的” 版本。对于 Ubuntu 和其他衍生产品，请选择 .deb 文件。



下载后，提取文件；你应该看到下面的所有软件包。



在提取文件的位置打开终端，并按顺序运行以下命令。首先，你需要安装 ure 包，其次是核心包，然后是所有的基本包。最后，就是主要的 LibreOffice 软件包。下面是一组典型的命令。你需要更改为具体版本的版本号。

sudo dpkg -i libobasis7.0-ure_7.0.4.2-2_amd64.deb
sudo dpkg -i libobasis7.0-core_7.0.4.2-2_amd64.deb
sudo dpkg -i libobasis7.0*


sudo dpkg -i libreoffice7.0*


如果你使用的是 Fedora Linux 或 Red Hat Linux，请按照上述相同的顺序使用 dnf 命令。



等待安装完成。完成后，你可以通过应用程序菜单找到 LibreOffice。



这应该完成安装最新 LibreOffice 的步骤。如果你不想遵循上述方法，请参阅以下选项。

通过 PPA 安装

如果你想通过 PPA 安装它，请按照以下步骤操作。确保在上面的第 1 步中删除现有的 LibreOffice。

sudo add-apt-repository ppa:libreoffice/ppa


最后，运行以下命令从这个官方 PPA 安装最新的 LibreOffice 5.4 系列。

sudo apt update
sudo apt install libreoffice


安装后，你可以通过 Dash 搜索启动 LibreOffice。



通过 Snap 和 Flatpak 安装

如果你是 Linux 用户，你可以尝试 LibreOffice 独立的可执行文件，它在 Snap 或 Flatpak 等沙箱中运行。

要通过 Flatpak 安装 LibreOffice ，请访问 这个页面 进行设置，然后运行以下命令进行安装：

flatpak install flathub org.libreoffice.LibreOffice


同样，对于 Snap 版本，使用以下命令进行安装：

sudo snap install libreoffice


如何升级到最新的 LibreOffice 版本？

如果你不想删除 LibreOffice 但想升级到最新版本，请阅读我们下面的完整指南。


在 Ubuntu、Linux Mint 和 Windows 中升级到最新的 LibreOffice


如果你在安装最新的 LibreOffice 时遇到问题，请随时留言。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[前言：先对广东潮州发生的2死多伤智能汽车失控事故致以默哀10分钟。


为啥写这篇文章，是因为看了很多网络评论的分析，都仅仅停留在刹车是否踩下等的初浅问题的讨论上。


作为某“大型”南极动物的工厂出来的前“某天网”安全架构师和项目主导人，我觉得有必要通过在网络安全角度，深入分析一下导致事故的各种因素，从而得出有利于对公众安全、长期认真真正负责任的分析。


首先我们知道，复杂系统一定是不可靠的，不管是谁做的。


这里先拿曾经的高铁动车事故来说：复杂的电信号和网络系统，总会因为人为的非人为的原因，导致系统层面的失控或者事故发生。


简单来说：对于安全而言，所有系统都有漏洞。  专业点来说：图灵完备的软件系统无法证明绝对正确。而智能汽车、智能电气系统，一定是有图灵完备的软件系统的：包含了spaceX这样的宇航员用的智能系统——曾经就发生过因为一个计算符号写少了等于号，所以价值几十亿美金的航天飞机失事，7个宇航员殉职。对没错，发生在美国。


温州动车事故发生后，作为没拿上岗许可证的程序员，内心很是惶恐。据说原因是某些没拿证的程序员开发的系统有BUG（程序错误）导致的信号系统失控。


当然，现在不用什么据说不据说，据说一般都是“谣言”。这里想说的是在各种事故发生了，总会有各种言论出来做为分析，不一定正确，但代表了某些人的看法。


某B音的飞机因传感器问题导致的软件系统失控，这里飞机驾驶员的权限还不如软件系统。然后大家都知道了，死了不少人，某型号的飞机也被禁飞了很久。


所以，我觉得：如果软件很重要，为什么不更注意安全多一些。在网络安全、软件安全、系统安全上投入多一些，总会带来更多的可靠性和品牌赞誉。


举了这么多例子，说了这么多事故的故事。那么我们如何来分析这次智能汽车导致的事故的原因呢？


智能系统一定是复杂系统，甚至…]]></summary>

一家初创公司借助 DALL-E 的 API 创建生成性的幻灯片（PPT），其产品旨在让用户在几分钟内，而不是几小时内创建幻灯片。他们发现，对于他们的大多数用户来说，“在几次尝试中可以得到一些有助于实现其观点的东西。”并且，他们还计划利用 GPT-3 对文件进行总结，添加到幻灯片中。


消息来源：Venture Beat



老王点评：这倒是一个好的应用，以后做 PPT 不用那么费劲就可以做出来了。




AI 辅助编程公司 Kite 关闭和宣布开源

成立于 2014 年的 AI 辅助编程公司 Kite 比 GitHub Copilot 起步更早，但很遗憾的是未能建立起一个盈利机制。Kite 虽然有 50 万月活跃开发者用户，但他们的支付意愿很低，仅仅提高程序员的编程速度 18% 并不能说服工程经理们掏钱。Kite 宣布停止运作，公开大部分源代码，项目托管在 GitHub 上。


消息来源：Kite



老王点评：看来 AI 替代人类进行编程，还有比较长的道路。




安全专家两年间秘密帮助解密勒索软件

安全研究人员在 Zeppelin 勒索软件的加密机制中发现了漏洞，并利用这些漏洞创建了一个工作的解密器，他们自 2020 年以来用于帮助受害公司恢复文件而不向攻击者付款。原本他们在 2020 年 2 月已经准备好了一份技术报告，但推迟了发布，以避免勒索黑帮知道，并悄悄帮助被勒索的机构恢复数据。可能是察觉了这种帮助解密的情况，现在 Zeppelin 采取了多次加密的方式来勒索赎金。


消息来源：Bleeping Computer



老王点评：说到底，勒索软件也是存在 bug 的，这就是和安全专家的博弈。]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[我们点评了为程序员和开发人员提供的十大最佳 Linux 发行版（2022 版），以帮助他们完成工作和个人项目。


程序员和开发人员在其工作或项目中会使用各种工具和应用程序，包括代码编辑器、编程语言编译器、附加组件、数据库等。如果你对现代开发者的工作流程进行分类，它包含以下典型的工作流程：


访问代码库

编程

调试

测试

部署


而这种典型的工作流程可能需要各种工具。一个标准的清单可能是这样的：


代码编辑器

简单的文本编辑器

网页浏览器（网页开发者需要所有变体）

数据库引擎

一个本地服务器

编程语言相应的编译器

调试器

监测或剖析工具（可执行文件或网络版）


可以说，与 Windows 相比，Linux 是编程的最佳选择。（出于几个原因，我在本文中不对 macOS 进行比较。）Linux 是最佳选择的主要原因是，与 Windows 相比，在 Linux 发行版中已经预装具有现代技术的软件包和应用程序，或非常容易安装。

因此，在这篇文章中，我们想列出 2022 年最适合程序员的 Linux 发行版。

2022 年适合程序员的十大 Linux 发行版

1、Fedora Workstation



也许这个名单中最完美的 Linux 发行版是 Fedora Linux。它用于桌面的默认 Workstation 版通过其选择的软件包带来了正宗的 GNOME 桌面体验。

Fedora Linux 的默认安装为你提供了所有主要的开发包，开箱即用。它们包括 PHP、OpenJDK、PostgreSQL、Django、Ruby on Rails、Ansible 等。

通过 dnf 软件包管理器安装更多的应用程序是非常简单的，如 VS Code 编辑器和其他软件包。你也可以借助“软件Softw…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Void is an independent binary distro created in 2008. Installed from a TUI installer, you assemble the user experience yourself. Void follows a conservative rolling release model and uses Runit instead of SystemD. Software is kept vanilla without Void branding. All the claims to fame are on the website https://voidlinux.org/. The following is why I use void, and why it may be a good option for you to.
 The conservative rolling model keeps behind a little bit, but not by a lot. New bugs introduced in major software versions have time to get squashed before reaching the end user. But you also won't have issues with old software making it a pain to interact with the outside world, and you won't be waiting for an OS release cycle for other bug fixes. You get relatively recent software without …]]></summary>

Nvidia drivers not ready yet, also I noticed some tablet settings are missing, also forced vysnc not a good idea (I know, it's changed recently.). So, can you tell me the status of Wayland in 2022-2023? What features is missing? Any sacrifice of KDE customisations? 
 Edit: Thanks you guys, for all answers. For me multi monitor setup and modern hardware support so crucial. Also I worried about old X apps. I searched technical side of Wayland, my brain is melting- So, I still learning Wayland and compositor side. Missing features will be add in the near future, I'm really happy to Wayland succes. Windows have this same problem, they can't change this stuff, W11 same. I hope Windows side get better and secure one day. :'3

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[以下是你如何在 Debian、Ubuntu 和其他发行版中修复 “bash: wget command not found” 的错误。


著名的 wget 工具被用来通过终端从 URL 下载任何文件。它是 Linux 终端中最流行和最快速的工具之一。

作为一个 GNU 工具，wget 带来了一些奇妙的功能。你可以实现各种目的，如从网上提取信息、下载文件、暂停/恢复等。

然而，许多 Linux 发行版 在默认安装时并没有附带这个工具。因此，当你想用 wget 下载一些文件时，你会得到 wget 命令未找到的错误。

修复它其实很容易。

修复 wget 命令未找到

你所需要做的就是打开终端，运行以下命令来安装 wget。

对于 Ubuntu、Linux Mint、elementaryOS、Debian 和相关发行版：

sudo apt install wget


Arch Linux：

pacman -S wget


对于 Fedora（虽然它默认包括）：

sudo dnf install wget


安装后，你就可以使用 wget 程序了。你也可以通过检查其版本来验证它是否正确安装。

wget --version


如何使用 wget

下面是一些关于如何使用 wget 的例子。

命令的语法如下：

wget [选项]… [URL]…


例如，如果我想下载 Ubuntu 的 ISO 文件，那么我可以运行下面的命令，用 URL 直接下载。

wget https://releases.ubuntu.com/22.04.1/ubuntu-22.04.1-desktop-amd64.iso




同样，你也可以使用上述命令下载，或者，通过下面描述的几个开关组合。你也可以通过 wget --help 命令得到这个：


-t, --tries=NUMBER 设置重试次数为 NUMBER（0 为不限）

--retry-connrefused 即使连接被拒绝，也要重试

--retry-on-http-error=ERRORS 逗号分隔的 HTTP 错误列表，以便重试

-O, --output-document=FILE 将文件写入 FILE 中

--nc, --no-clobber 跳过那些会下载到现有文件的下载（即覆盖它们）

--no-netrc 不要试图从 .netrc 中获取证书

-c, --continue 继续已部分下载的文件

--start-pos=OFFSET 从 OFFSET 位置开始下载

--progress=TYPE 选择进度条类型

--show-progress 在详细模式下显示进度条

--N, --timestamping 不重新获取文件，除非比本地文件新

--no-if-modified-since 在时间戳模式下不使用条件性的 if-modified-since 获取请求的资源

--no-use-server-timestamps 不以服务器上的时间戳来设置本地文件的时间戳

--S, --server-response 打印服务器响应

--spider 不下载任何东西

-T, --timeout=SECONDS 设置所有的超时值为 SECONDS 秒

--dns-timeout=SECS 将 DNS 查询超时设置为 SECS

--connect-timeout=SECS 将连接超时设置为 SECS

--read-timeout=SECS 设置读取超时为 SECS

--w, --wait=SECONDS 在两次检索之间等待 SECONDS 秒（适用于检索的 URL 超过 1个）

--waitretry=SECONDS 在检索的重试之间等待 1 到 SECONDS 秒（适用于检索的 URL 超过 1 个）

--random-wait 在两次检索之间等待 0.5WAIT 到 1.5WAIT 秒（适用于检索的 URL 超过 1 个）


总结

我希望这个指南能帮助你解决 Linux 发行版中的 wget 错误。显然方案是非常简单的。

如果有帮助或者你有任何问题，请在下面留言。

 No more mkinitramfs. No more initcpio. No more dracut… Generate once, run any OS or kernel you want with only one image!!!
 No more /boot. YOUR KERNELS CAN STAY IN YOUR ENCRYPTED OR LVM2 PV.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[To all of you experts, kindly state in clear fashion why, if you choose any side of it.
 Let me start with my understanding (please don't fret) 
 I can assure you that git is software that gobbles up more of your time than anything else. But ...but ... It is worth spending time with something, which has an impact on long-term good and boosts efficiency guarantee. All you need is a little bit of patience to brush aside the difficulty it imposes.
 Make no mistake, that this damn thing is pretty hard to get efficient(I know ..I know, masters will say, you miss the point of its efficiency). But, I am looking at it, like an average person uses it and it takes tons of time to get the basics right(like everything else??)..
 If you think, there is a psychological barrier or mental block or grey cells of mine are not good enough to capture the vibe, then I must say, you are not wrong.
 So, flame(not to roast me, but to suggest, it is an old school lingo, pardon me) me with your understanding and, please, wit ,satire and subtility always bypass me somehow.
 Kindly, be to the point.
 Thank you.

 I got tired of Windows and I AM ready to sacrifice Adobe products as well as games for the sake of security,privacy and convenience. 
 If that's all I need to sacrifice, count me in ! 
 I was wondering, before I jump into it, what are main things that every novice should know about and first steps one should take after first install of linux distro ? 
 Oh btw, some dictionary would be awesome to have, like, explaining what distro means, what some commands mean, etc.
 Basically Linux lexicon would be great to have.

 Edit: before starting any war here. I use ubuntu since 2015. I like how gnome looks (I even liked unity). I feel that I am using something different than Windows and Mac. But when I compare it to any other flavor, I feel they are snappier, less machine demanding than gnome.
 I really want to understand.

 But then comes the issue that gets me every time… audio quality. I am NOT an audiophile, i use normal desk speakers and a very decent headset. In windows i use a soundblaster z, before that i used an x-fi an, audigy 1 and SB Live.
 I realize creative offers no support on linux but the drivers are present in the kernel and audio works without much hassle.
 But everything sounds muffled, dull and too bassy. I tried the integrated sound card, same issue. Tried a USB headset, exactly the same problem. Tried external speakers, different headset it’s all the same.
 I followed tutorials on how to modify resampling, equalizers, switching to pipewire etc… Nothing got me clear sound. Modifying settings via alsamixer , modifying crystalizer etc. Nothing comes close to the audio experience in windows.
 And then came games. I love what valve is doing with proton and i own a steamdeck. On my steamdeck the audio is far better so i know it can be improved. I just do not know where to find what/how they do it.
 Positional audio is almost non existent on any of my linux installs everything gets forced into stereo. Selecting 5.1 always sends audio to the wrong channels. (Center channel to left front for ex.)
 So that is the only thing that keeps me from using linux, the abysmal sound experience breaks my spirit every time.
 Cheers.

 Just to preface this, yes! I have an Nvidia GPU. But guess what? That doesn't change a damn thing about what I'm about to say. First off, My experience, at least when it comes to the graphic stack, took an immense step forward with Wayland. 
 some of the good things I noticed: 
  
My two monitors have mismatched refresh rates and Wayland properly addressed them.
 Screentearing wasn't noticeable, if it even exists
 ...
  
That's it. Everything else is a regression.
 First off, if you're not using Gnome or KDE, you're pretty much a 3rd rate citizen. 
  
Screen sharing doesn't fucking work. Period. I do not consider a screensharing model where you have to share your entire screen or nothing as "working". You can't share individual applications.…]]></summary>

MacOS 包管理器 Homebrew 的创建者新开发了一个名为 Tea 的包管理器，作为 Homebrew 的最终继承者。Tea 除了一些包管理器的新功能之外，还有一种基于区块链的方法，以确保开源软件的创造者、维护者和贡献者都能为他们的努力获得报酬。他从 NFT 中获得了灵感，简单来说，关注开源软件生态健康的人可以购买通证并质押，而 Tea 作为一个 DAO 会奖励质押者和注册的软件包及其依赖关系的贡献者。

协调世界时将停止添加“闰秒”

11 月 18 日，全球代表在计量大会（CGPM）上投票决定，“从 2035 年起，将搁置在官方时钟上增加‘闰秒’以使其与地球自转同步的做法。”这意味着从 2035 年开始，或者可能更早，天文时间（称为 UT1）将被允许与协调世界时（UTC）相差一秒以上，甚至多达一分钟，而协调世界时是以原子钟的稳定滴答为基础。添加闰秒的做法始于 1972 年。


消息来源：《自然杂志》



老王点评：添加闰秒给互联网服务和各种依赖精确计时的服务带来很多麻烦，而且我们可能还面临着史无前例的负闰秒。取消了也好。




GIMP 2.99.14 发布

这是迈向 GIMP 3.0 的最新开发版本，GIMP 3.0 将从 GTK2 切换到 GTK3 工具箱，并有大量仍在开发中的其他改进。此版本的具体改进没有什么太值得说的，在发布公告中说，“从 3.0 的路线图中可以看出，大多数项目都‘接近完成’或‘已经完成’。……真正接近了 GIMP 3.0 的发布。……开始针对具体的痛点，很多痛点。”

 I browsed distrowatch for a distro that I like. There are a lot of distros. 
 I decided to install Ubuntu.
 I love the open source feeling. It has a different feeling than Windows for sure. A lot of things working differently. I love the terminal, but i only can copy and paste commands. I want to learn to use it. The best command i know so far is neofetch. That looks very good! 
 Fortunately most of the sofwares i use are open source, so they are available on Linux too (VLC, Chromium, etc.).
 Thanks for reading my post.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[全球首富、推特新老板马斯克星期天（11月20日）在推特上公布恢复特朗普账号的决定。马斯克写道：“民众已经决定。将恢复特朗普（的账号）。人民之声，就是上帝之声。”


综合彭博社和路透社报道，马斯克星期五（18日）在推特展开24小时民调，询问网民是否应该恢复特朗普的账号，共收到超过1500万张票，赞同者以51.8%胜出。


就允许特朗普重返推特的决定，马斯克用拉丁语短语写道：“民之声，神之声（Vox Populi, Vox Dei）”。在2021年1月6日美国国会山骚乱事件发生后，推特在其联合创始人兼时任CEO多尔西（Jack Dorsey）的领导下“永久封禁”了特朗普的8800万推特粉丝的推特账号。


据《华盛顿邮报》报导，特朗普周六在线上参加活动时谈到了马斯克发起的民意调查和他的推特账户主题。特朗普对重返推特平台的前景反应冷淡，重申了之前的言论，即他宁愿将注意力集中在他的克隆网站“Truth Social”上。


特朗普在谈到重返推特时说：“我看不出有什么理由，对于很多人来说Truth Social已经取代了（推特）的位置，我不认为他们会回到推特上”。虽然特朗普借机宣传自己的社交媒体平台，但他说自己很欣赏这次投票，并欢迎马斯克对推特的收购。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Fedora Workstation 37 是 Fedora Project 桌面操作系统的最新版本，由致力于推动开源创新的全球社区开发。本文介绍了 Fedora Workstation 37 中一些面向用户的新功能。现在就从 GNOME “软件Software”应用升级，或者在你最喜欢的终端模拟器中使用 dnf system-upgrade 升级！

GNOME 43

Fedora Workstation 37 具有最新版本的 GNOME 桌面环境，其中包含更多移植到 GTK 4 的核心应用、用户界面调整和性能调整。查看 GNOME 43 发行说明 了解更多信息！

重新设计的快速设置菜单



新的“快速设置Quick Settings”菜单提供更多控制和便利。你现在可以在菜单中轻松切换你的 Wi-Fi 网络，而不用进入全屏对话框；在默认模式和深色模式之间切换；以及在不打开“设置Settings”应用的情况下启用夜灯。现在还提供了一个方便的截屏和录屏按钮。

核心应用

Fedora Workstation 37 中包含的 GNOME 核心应用已经进行了一轮调整和改进：


“文件Files”应用已移植到 GTK 4，并且用户界面有许多改进。这里只是其中的一些：

它现在是自适应的，这意味着它会自动调整到更窄的尺寸，从而更好地利用可用空间。

列表视图已重新设计，使橡皮筋选择更容易。

重新设计了 “属性Properties” 和 “打开方式……Open With…” 对话框。 




“日历Calendar”应用有一个新的边栏，可以一目了然地显示即将发生的事件。它与“联系人Contacts”应用一起，现在具有自适应用户界面。

“角色Characters”应用现在会向你显示不同的肤色、头发颜色和表情符号的性别选项。

“软件Software” 中的包源选择器已重新设计并移至更显眼的位置。

“地图Maps”应用已移植到 GTK 4。

“设置Settings”应用包括一个新的“设备安全Device Security”面板，让你可以轻松查看你的设备提供或缺少的硬件安全功能！ 


新补充的默认壁纸

Fedora Workstation 37 附带一组新的补充壁纸。 在这里看看它们是如何制作的！



Fedora Linux 37 的底层变化

Fedora Linux 37 具有许多底层更改。以下是一些值得注意的：


现已正式支持树莓派 4 单板机，包括 3D 加速！

在 BIOS 系统上的新安装将使用 GPT 磁盘布局，而不是传统的 MBR 布局。在 BIOS 系统上，安装程序镜像现在还将使用 GRUB 而不是 syslinux 进行引导。

如果你禁用然后重新启用 SELinux，或运行 fixfiles onboot 命令，文件系统的重新标记过程现在将并行完成，从而显着提高速度。

波斯语的默认字体已从 DejaVu 和 Noto Sans Arabic 更改为 Vazirmatn，为在波斯语中使用 Fedora Linux 的用户提供更一致的体验。


还有这些...

Fedora 项目中发生的很酷的事情！


Fedora CoreOS 和 Fedora Cloud Base 已升级为 “版本Edition” 级别！

Fedora Linux 系统安装程序，带有新 GUI 的 Anaconda 预览安装程序镜像将在大约一周内可用。我将发布一篇文章以提供更多详细信息，敬请关注！

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[在本文中，我们将讨论网络连接最基本的诊断工具之一：ping 命令。




如今，联网计算机变得十分普遍，以至于我们大多数人都理所当然地认为，房间一侧的计算机可以连接上房间另一侧的计算机，更不用说能连接上世界的另一端的计算机了。如此，网络使互联网、云、文件共享、媒体流、远程管理、打印等服务成为可能。但是当网络出现问题时，有时很难诊断到底是其中哪一环节出现了问题。下面，我们就来介绍：网络连接最基本的诊断工具之一—— ping 命令。

基本的 ping 命令

当你无法访问本地网络上的计算机或互联网上的服务器时，你可以 ping 它的 IP 地址。ping 将 互联网控制报文协议Internet Control Message Protocol（ICMP）数据包发送到目标 IP 地址。当我们要对网路连接状况进行判断时，ICMP 是个非常有用的协议，本质上 ICMP 是一个响应和应答信号。

让我们由近及远地进行故障排除。请先 ping 你自己的计算机，以确保你的计算机正在运行 网络栈networking stack。你正在操作的计算机称为 主机localhost，本地回环地址是：127.0.0.1。

ping 命令能用主机的 主机名 hostname、IP 地址（即 127.0.0.1）或者仅仅用简写 0 来表示 “主机”。

你可以使用 -c 选项，来控制发送数据包的 次数count。

$ ping 0 -c 1
PING 0 (127.0.0.1) 56(84) bytes of data.
64 bytes from 127.0.0.1: icmp_seq=1 ttl=64 time=0.069 ms

 Maybe certificates, contributing, or administrating servers? I already do administrate a bunch of arch and proxmox servers and I've been using arch on desktop since about a year, contributing code sounds very fun, I'm especially interested in low level development. Certificates bore the hell out of me though.
 By the way, I don't want to land a job at a shitty place like Microsoft or Google, I just want to be useful.

I don't know much about these tools though, besides that they are used mostly in resource-constrained systems.
 I was interested in learning a bit more about the differences between the *box and *base projects, and if there are any advantages or disadvantages on a full desktop environment.

11 月 15 日，Meta 公司发布了一个名为 Galactica 的新的大型语言模型。它是一个用于科学的大型语言模型，由 4800 万篇科学文章、网站文章、教科书、讲义和维基等训练而成。Meta 公司将其模型宣传为研究人员和学生的捷径，说它“可以总结学术论文，解决数学问题，生成维基文章，编写科学代码，为分子和蛋白质做注解，等等。”但是，像所有的语言模型一样，Galactica 只是一个无意识的机器人，无法区分事实与虚构。几小时内，科学家们就在社交媒体上分享了它有偏见和不正确的结果。三天后，Meta 撤下了它的在线演示版本。

对多因素认证的攻击正在增加

三年前，针对多因素认证（MFA）的攻击非常罕见，因为很少有机构启用 MFA。但随着微软、谷歌等开始推行多因素认证，对它的攻击开始增加。在这些攻击中，攻击者破坏了发给已经完成多因素认证的人的令牌，并复制该令牌以获得不同设备的访问。令牌是 OAuth 2.0 身份平台的核心，其目的是使用户的身份验证更简单、更快速，并能抵御密码攻击。微软的检测和响应团队发现攻击者为此目的利用令牌盗窃的情况有所增加。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[使用这个开源工具，即使是批量校正图像也很容易。


多年前，在翻阅一家旧书店的书架上的内容时，我偶然发现了一本名为 《UNIX System Command Summary for Berkeley 4.2 & 4.3 BSD》 的小册子，由 Specialized Systems Consultants 出版。我买它是出于好奇，因为它已经有将近 20 年的历史了，但仍然在很大程度上适用于现代 Linux 和 BSD。

无论是当时还是现在，我都很开心。一本写于 1986 年的小册子在 2016 年仍然很重要，而同一个书架上关于专有操作系统的书籍并不值得印刷它们的纸张。（想一想：你认为什么技术可以在僵尸末日中幸存下来？）这本小册子已经放在我自己的书架上好几年了，但我突然想到可能值得对这个作品做一点数字保存，所以我决定扫描这本小册子来创建一本 CBZ 电子书。

使用 Skanlite 进行扫描很容易，但很耗时。然而，当我完成后，我发现有些页面不是很平整。



在打印中，这称为配准问题，这意味着打印内容的位置在页面上的方向不正确。

ImageMagick

ImageMagick 是基于终端的非交互式图形编辑器。尝试在无图形环境（如纯文本终端）中编辑图形似乎违反直觉，但实际上很常见。例如，当你将图像上传到 Web 应用用作个人资料图片时，应用服务器上的脚本可能会使用 ImageMagick 或其库处理你的图像。非交互式编辑器的优点是你可以制定需要对示例图像执行的操作，然后只需按一下按钮即可将这些效果应用于数百个其他图像。

ImageMagick 通常与其他图形编辑器一样强大，只要你花时间了解它的许多功能以及如何组合它们以实现所需的效果。在这种情况下，我想旋转歪斜的页面。在搜索了 ImageMagick 的文档后，我发现我需要的解决方案的 ImageMagick 术语称为纠偏。将你的术语与其他人的术语保持一致对于你不知道的任何事情都是一个挑战，因此当你使用 ImageMagick（或其他任何东西）时，请记住，你描述问题或解决方案的用词可能和别人不一样。

要使用 ImageMagick 对带有弯曲文本的图像进行校正：

$ convert page_0052.webp -deskew25% fix_0052.webp


-deskew 选项表示可接受偏差的阈值。通过跟踪看似字母的对象的峰谷来确定倾斜。根据扫描的弯曲程度，你可能需要多于或少于 25% 的阈值。我已经达到了 80%，到目前为止，低于 25% 没用效果。

结果如下：



修复了！将其应用于文档的剩余 55 页以修复倾斜的页面，而对已经笔直的页面不做任何事情。换句话说，由于我的阈值设置，在不需要调整的页面上运行此命令是安全的。

使用 ImageMagick 裁剪图像

在纠正了歪斜之后，因为我扫描每一页都比必要的范围要多，以防止意外切断单词，我认为裁剪我纠正的页面是有意义的。我很高兴在页边空白处保留一些空间，但没有以前那么多。我经常使用 ImageMagick 的“裁剪”功能来处理这个网站上的图像，所以我很熟悉这个选项。但是，我需要确定如何裁剪每一页。

首先，我需要图像的大小：

$ identify fixed_0052.webp
WEBP 1128x2593 1128x2593+0+08-bit sRGB 114732B 0.020u 0:00.021


知道尺寸后，我能够对我可以承受的丢失多少像素做出一些估计。经过几次试运行，我得到了这个：

convert fix_0052.webp -gravity Center -crop 950x2450+0+0 crop_0052.webp


这并不完全适合，但当我将它应用于册子中的其他图像时，它被证明很重要。这些页面的内容和扫描仪位置各不相同，所以我很高兴给每一页一点空余空间。

这是校正和裁剪的图像：



使用开源批量编辑图像

ImageMagick 的美妙之处在于，当你确定了修复图像的公式，你就可以将该修复应用于需要相同修复的所有图像。我使用 GNU Parallel 执行此操作，它使用我所有的 CPU 内核来完成数百页的图像校正。这并不需要很长时间，而且结果不言而喻。更重要的是，我已经有了一个 UNIX 历史上有趣作品的数字档案。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[美国司法部在11月16日的新闻发布会上表示，两名俄罗斯国民，33岁的安东·纳波斯基（Anton Napolsky）和27岁的瓦莱莉雅·埃尔马科娃（Valeriia Ermakova）于11月3日在阿根廷科尔多瓦被捕。这两名俄罗斯公民被指控侵犯版权、电信诈骗和洗钱。同时，美国政府查封并关闭了Z-Library的249个在线域名，并撤除了该网站。


联邦检察官表示，Z-Library自2009年创建以来提供超过1100万本电子书供读者下载，但该网站提供的许多电子书受知识产权保护。


“被告从他们偷来的作品中非法获利，经常在作品出版几小时后就上传，在这个过程中，作者、出版商和书商受害，”纽约布鲁克林的司法部检察官布伦·皮斯(Breon Peace)说。


网站所有者通过捐款和收取部分访问费用，建立了一个由249个网站域名组成的网络，并通过一个易于访问的主页将它们链接起来，从而避免了多次封锁和关闭。


Z-Library，通常被称为z-lib，在许多国家因侵犯版权而受到法律攻击。


2022年8月，法国出版商联盟(French Publishers Union)称这些网站对出版业构成了严重威胁，并赢得了在法国封锁Z-Library网站的法院命令。


在去年的一份法庭文件中，美国作家协会(US Authors Guild)表示，Z-Library“可能是世界上最受瞩目、流量最大的图书盗版网站”。


美国作家协会表示，Z-Library与主要的合法下载服务一起出现在常规的网络搜索中，因此它们看起来是合法的。


停刊令世界各地的读者感到沮丧，包括许多学生在网上抱怨说，他们无法负担z图书馆提供的教科书的商业价格。


尼日利亚数字营销专家阿德瑞诺拉·阿约米德(Aderinola Ayomide)在脸书上写道：“使用这个网站的主要是那些买不起昂贵课本的学生、从事研究和撰写文章的人。”


菲律宾的卡莱尔·德拉·佩纳(Karyle Dela Pena)在脸书上写道，“Z-Library是我下载天体物理学教科书的唯一途径”，因为它们的成本通常很高。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[这些年来，我通过这些开源资源提高了我的 Python 技能。


我最近决定进一步学习 Python，以便提高我的教学技能，拓宽我的学生的视野。在这个过程中，我发现了这些优秀的资源，让我学习新的代码，并提高了对 Python 的整体理解。

1、《教孩子学编程 Python 语言版》

我的 Python 之旅大约是 7 年前开始的，当时我发现了 Apple LOGO 和 Python 中的 Turtle 模块 之间的联系。当时使用的 Linux 计算机的默认 Python 版本为 Python 2.7，我很快发现我想使用 Python 3。我成功地安装了它，并开始使用 Turtle 模块编写一些简单的程序。在阅读 Dr. Bryson Payne 的 《教孩子学编程 Python 语言版》 之后，我意识到 Python 不仅仅是 Turtle。那时我安装了 IDLE。

2、IDLE

在使用 IDLE 工作的过程中，交互式界面优化了我的体验，并让我有足够的信心来考虑向学生教授 Python。我志愿帮助我社区中的一群在家学习的孩子，很快我发现自己在教授一个有十六个孩子的班级！我很高兴他们的父母同意帮助我，否则我想我会被压垮。这个经历激发了我学习更多的欲望，以便我可以教授更多。

3.、Mu 编辑器

2018 年春天，我参加了 PyConUS。我听了一场由中学老师 Nicholas Tollervey 主讲的演讲，他为学龄前儿童编写了一个 Python 开发环境。Mu 编辑器 内置了一个可以帮助我找到代码中的错误的 质检工具Linter。Mu 帮助我提高了我的编码技能，我也能够与学生分享这些技能，他们也从中受益。

我的自信和经验增长后，我希望与更多的学生分享 Python 之旅。我与其他人合作撰写了一个申请书，以教授一个使用树莓派 4 和 Python 的课程。疫情打断了这个计划。在此期间，树莓派基金会发布了树莓派 400。2021 年春天，我使用了前一年开发的材料和一个来自当地图书馆的慷慨的资助，来 教授两组 学生如何编程。这个活动非常成功并在今年再次举办。

4、Codium

几年前，我了解到微软的 VS Code 是一个可以在 Linux 上使用的开源代码编辑器。我最近才了解到，如何在 VS Code 中配置和使用 Python 虚拟环境。我的问题在一篇 关于虚拟环境的文章 中得到了解答，这让我可以知道如何在 Linux 计算机上设置和配置 Python 虚拟环境。大约在同一时间，我发现了 Codium，一个围绕 VS Code 构建的社区项目。

现在我希望与我的学生分享 VS Codium 的体验，并让他们对 Python 的理解不再局限于 Turtle 模块。这种学习的热情让我寻找开源且可以在互联网上随意获得的教学资源。

5、《Python 编程练习，简单解释》

《Python 编程快速上手 让繁琐工作自动化》 这本书是我最喜欢的一本书。现在，作者已经发布了 《Python 编程练习，简单解释》。这两本书都可以免费在线阅读，并且都采用了知识共享许可证。

6、《每个人都可以使用 Python》

Dr. Charles Severance 在 2017 年发布了 《每个人都可以使用 Python》，我非常推荐这本书。他为像我这样的有抱负的程序员提供了简短的课程。课程的代码可以在 GitHub 上找到，所以你可以下载它并在自己的计算机或学校网络上安装它。

7. Python 视频

最近，我了解到 Jay LaCroix 在 YouTube 上有一系列精彩的视频，其中包括 28 个免费视频，从 Python 基础开始，涵盖了 Python 编程 的全面介绍。最重要的是，他使用的是 Linux 计算机，因此他的课程特别适合 Linux 编程环境。这些视频的其中一个收获是学习如何使用 nano 作为编程环境，它默认情况下包含在大多数 Linux 发行版中。

你的学习之路

此处提到的这七个资源帮助我成长为一名程序员，它们都是开源的并可以与其他人分享。你是如何提高编程技能的？你有什么要分享的吗？在评论中告诉我们。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[For many years now I have been using Linux, but I still qualify myself as a newbie, always assuming that I know much less than the person answering my question when asking questions about some topic. On one side I see that I now know much more than when I for the first time installed Ubuntu LTS 12.04, on the other, I know that I have never used some functionalities that are considered advanced knowledge. 
 My flavor of choice is Debian at the moment. I do not regret switching from Ubuntu. I find it to be simpler to use and solve problems, also help topics while rarer, are more to a point, and more helpful than those found for Ubuntu earlier. 
 Recently I have found out that I am now able to solve most problems with the use of the internet without having to ask a question. On the other hand, I have never compiled a program from a source or made a bash script other than some simple automation to add some folder structure. For a few months now I am running a small homelab which worked out better than expected. 
 There are topics to be learned, which are not really Linux knowledge (DNS, networking, ...) that Microsoft managed under the hood, but a Linux user must know more to be able to successfully configure it, but that's another story. 
 TLDR: Searching for a tool to assess my Linux knowledge. I am not really considering a certification exam, but that might also be an option, some cheaper one that won't break the bank while still being useful. I am looking for some self-assess tools (like language questionnaires). 
 Also, it might be time for some deeper knowledge, so resources (a book or a course) about Linux in depth would be helpful too.

 Overall “Yama” is an LSM that was merged in kernel 3.4. The goal of “Yama” is to restrict the usage of the “ptrace” syscall (“man 2 ptrace”). Limiting the usage of “ptrace” is one way to isolate between running applications, thus even in case one application is breached it won’t be able to attach to other running applications (like browsers, crypto wallets, encryption apps, remote connection session and more) and read/write to sensitive data or change the f…]]></summary>

at the discussion around the GNU Tools Infrastructure proposal.


	Sourceware, a volunteer group that has been supporting various
	critical FOSS developer tools for more than two decades, is being
	courted by The Linux Foundation's Open Source Security Foundation
	(OpenSSF). The OpenSSF aims to improve open source software
	security by providing Sourceware projects with more modern IT
	infrastructure.

	But some members of the Sourceware community fear that accepting
	the help of the OpenSSF would give the corporate Linux world more
	leverage over FOSS developer tools. They would prefer to seek
	support from the Software Freedom Conservancy, a charitable
	non-profit that they believe is better aligned with software
	freedom.

 Can someone please share how linux rose to dominance over unix? From what I understand the emergence of the x86 chips made the hardware servers more scalable and there’s the attraction of open source software plus free. But what’s the reason behind the scale of the shift in preferred OS?
 Also is there any known competitor to linux now such that linux might be replaced and follow the path of unix? Thanks for your insights

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[一半的 macOS 恶意软件都来自一个“杀毒软件”

Elastic 安全实验室发现，一半 macOS 恶意软件来自 MacKeeper。讽刺的是，MacKeeper 声称 “以零努力保持你的 Mac 清洁和安全”。该程序可以被威胁者滥用，因为它有广泛的权限和对进程和文件的访问。这意味着，一个旨在保持 Mac 安全不受网络威胁的程序可能使你的系统处于危险之中。 MacKeeper 也以难以完全卸载而著称。然而，Mac 仍然是恶意软件最少的操作系统，研究发现只有 6.2% 的恶意软件出现在 macOS 上，而 Windows 和 Linux 上则分别为 54.4% 和 39.4%。


消息来源：Neowin



老王点评：这可真够讽刺的，一个杀毒软件反而是最大的黑窝。




开源推动 5G 占据了 50% 的电信市场

5G 部署现在已经超过 50% 的电信市场规模，这得益于开源。Linux 基金会称，在这一切的背后，“是向开放网络和框架的彻底转变。无论经济和政治风向如何，这种转变都在继续。事实上，开源可能是唯一没有受到影响的领域，因为它有能力跨越国界和边界来做需要做的事情。”据一些分析师的说法，到 2030 年，5G 的经济价值将达到 7 万亿美元。


消息来源：ZDNet



老王点评：开源居然对 5G 的推广有这么大的作用，这是有些想不到。




Mozilla 收入更多样，但仍然主要依靠谷歌

Mozilla 今天发布了其年度《Mozilla 状况》报告，2021 年，Mozilla 公司从搜索合作、订阅和广告收入中获得了 5.85 亿美元，比前一年增长了 25%。除了主要来自谷歌的搜索合作的收入之外，来自 Mozilla VPN、Mozilla MDN Plus、Pocket 等新产品的收入为 5700 万美元，与前一年相比增长了 125%。


消息来源：Tech Crunch



老王点评：虽然 Mozilla 也有一些让人批评的地方，但是这已经是自由开源世界不多的重要旗舰了。]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[本文讲述如何一步步在 Linux 上安装 AWS CLI（命令行工具）。


AWS CLI 是一个能够和 AWS 账户进行交互的命令行程序。开发者和系统管理员用它管理日常的活动和自动化。

准备环节


安装好的 Linux 系统

具有管理员权限的 sudo 账户

能够联网


现在让我们开始安装：

1、下载安装文件

打开终端使用 curl 命令下载 AWS CLI 的安装文件：

$ curl "https://awscli.amazonaws.com/awscli-exe-linux-x86_64.zip" -o "awscliv2.zip"




以上命令会在当前工作目录下载一个 awscliv2.zip 的文件。

使用 ls 命令 确认当前下载下来的文件：

$ ls -l awscliv2.zip
-rw-rw-r-- 1 linuxtechi linuxtechi 47244662 Oct 20 10:53 awscliv2.zip
$


2、解压缩下载的文件

使用 unzip 命令 解压安装包：

$ unzip awscliv2.zip


它会在当前目录创建一个 aws 文件夹，把解压好的文件放进去：

$ ls -ld aws
drwxr-xr-x 3 linuxtechi linuxtechi 4096 Oct 19 17:18 aws
$


3、运行安装脚本

使用以下命令运行安装脚本：

$ sudo ./aws/install




脚本会把所有安装的文件放到 /usr/local/aws-cli 目录下，然后创建一个链接文件到 /usr/local/bin 目录。

4、检查 AWS CLI 的版本

运行以下脚本检查版本：

$ aws --version
aws-cli/2.8.4 Python/3.9.11 Linux/5.15.0-48-generic exe/x86_64.ubuntu.22 prompt/off
$


5、配置 AWS CLI

为了验证 AWS CLI 是否安装正确，开始配置 AWS CLI：

登录你的 AWS 管理控制台，取得 AWS 访问密钥 IDAccess Key ID 和 安全访问密钥Secret Access Key。

如果还没完成创建，请先创建，并把它们复制到安全的地方。



然后回到命令行，运行以下命令：

$ aws configure
AWS Access Key ID [None]: xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
AWS Secret Access Key [None]: xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
Default region name [None]: us-west-2
Default output format [None]: json
$


以上的证书会被保存到这个文件：

$ cat  ~/.aws/credentials


上面的命令的输出：



运行 aws 命令列出你账户中的 s3 储存和 VPC：

$ aws s3 ls
$ aws ec2 describe-vpcs


输出如下：



成功输出内容，说明你的 AWS CLI 已经配置完成。

这就是这篇文章的全部内容，请在下面的评论区发表你的疑问和反馈。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[这篇文章能让你了解如何使用 Checksec ，来识别一个可执行文件的安全属性，了解安全属性的含义，并知道如何使用它们。




编译源代码会生成一个二进制文件（LCTT 译注：即 .o 文件）。在编译期间，你可以向 gcc 编译器提供 标志flags，以启用或禁用二进制文件的某些属性，这些属性与安全性相关。

Checksec 是一个漂亮的小工具，同时它也是一个 shell 脚本。Checksec 可以识别编译时构建到二进制文件中的安全属性。编译器可能会默认启用一些安全属性，你也可以提供特定的标志，来启用其他的安全属性。

本文将介绍如何使用 Checksec ，来识别二进制文件的安全属性，包括：


Checksec 在查找有关安全属性的信息时，使用了什么底层的命令

在将源代码编译成二进制文件时，如何使用GNU 编译器套件GNU Compiler Collection（即 GCC）来启用安全属性。


安装 checksec

要在 Fedora 和其他基于 RPM 的 Linux 系统上，安装 Checksec，请使用以下命令：

$ sudo dnf install checksec


对于基于 Debian 的 Linux 发行版，使用对应的 apt 命令，来安装 Checksec。

$ sudo apt install checksec


shell 脚本

在安装完 Checksec 后，能够发现 Checksec 是一个单文件的 shell 脚本，它位于 /usr/bin/checksec，并且这个文件挺大的。Checksec 的一个优点是你可以通过快速通读这个 shell 脚本，从而了解 Checksec 的执行原理、明白所有能查找有关二进制文件或可执行文件的安全属性的系统命令：

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, I was thinking how (title) would be possible to do with least effort and i thought "would be nice if PATH was a function or some kind of pythonish @property ". I didn't want to write any function that would add my pwd to the path when i cd to it and then remove it when i change working dir again. And I didn't find anything useful while searching google for temporary path change (maybe i just can't "play prompt" uell).
 So i tried just binding function to PATH and it... worked?
 export PATH=$PATH:$pwd 
 I don't quite understand why it works, because _nothing_ is changed in PATH variable when I print it using env (maybe because it's bash builtin?) but it always searches PWD as if it was in PATH and I'm kinda happy it required no effort to setup. Sharing, maybe some ppl didn't know of such trick just as I didn't.

We are selling standalone boring, mainly desktop (although it runs on beefier laptops as well) software. It's for Windows and written in boring technologies (C99 for the engine and C# for GUI).
We are considering various business models when it comes to selling it in the future as our current one causes a lot of problems. Some options and thoughts I have about them right now:
1)What I call a "classical model" which we tried so far: release 1.0 version, sell it for a fixed price. Continue to support it for a while with bugfixes/features. At some point move to developing 2.0 version, sell it again (giving discounts for current 1.0 customers).
Advantages: simple, the customers can use software they purchased forever
Disadvantages: at some point you need to start collecting features…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The “charger_manager” kernel thread is created by a freezable workqueue https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/latest/source/drivers/power/supply/charger-manager.c#L1749) . Freezable workqueues are basically frozen when the system is moved to a suspend state (https://lwn.net/Articles/403891/).
 Based on the kernel source code “charger_manager” is responsible for monitoring the health (like temperature monitoring) of the battery and controlling the charger while the system is suspended to memory (https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/latest/source/drivers/power/supply/charger-manager.c) . Also, the “Charger Manager” kernel module is written by MyungJoo Ham. (https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/latest/source/drivers/power/supply/charger-manager.c#L1768).
 Moreover, the kernel documentation states that the “Charger Manager’’ also helps in giving an aggregated view to userspace in case they are multiple chargers for a battery. In case they are multiple batteries with different chargers on a system, that system would need multiple instances of “Charger Manager” (https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/v5.3/power/charger-manager.html) .
 On my Ubuntu VM (22.04.1 LTS) this kernel module is not compiled as a separate “*.ko” file. It is compiled into the kernel itself (builtin), as you can see in the output of “modinfo” in the screenshot below.
 charger_manager is a builtin kernel module (Ubuntu 22.04.1 LTS)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I often find some bit of interesting software and install it test for a week or two. Frequently, I end up changing something in defaults, whether theme or some other parameter, and this drops a config into my $XDG_CONFIG_HOME where the program supports it and just $HOME if not. There is a similar, but less noticeable, effect happening in $XDG_DATA_HOME and $XDG_CACHE_HOME.
 When I later remove the software after determining unsuitability or just general dislike, I'm left with an orphaned config file. I usually forget to purge it when I remove the program. This means I have a lot of orphaned configs files.
 Recently, I've taken to doing my testing in distrobox podman containers to more easily ensure that software, and ~all~ dependencies, get purged on un-install, but this does nothing for user-config files. I could re-train myself to be better about seek-n-destroying configs on software removal. Likewise, I could use a dotfiles manager to mark the configs I definitely want to keep and then set up a cron job to nuke $XDG_CONFIG_HOME and reload my "keepers." I really feel like have a program to scan my config-dirs and compare against installed user-space applications for autoremoval of orphaned configs is perhaps the better way to go. I also am fully aware of the challenges involved in writing such software.
 Nonetheless, and finally, the question:
 Is there already a program for cleaning up orphaned software-config files from $HOME?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[To make it easier to make Linux a target for native application development, why not just have a library that wraps the "native" UI toolkit of whatever DE you're using? Every toolkit could host their own (or have one created by the community), and any application that is built on it would automatically theme correctly and feel completely at home due to using the DE's standard widget kit under the hood.
 ​
 Older applications wouldn't draw in a ton of deps from an old UI kit, newer apps could work on older systems, etc. Of course this wouldn't be without drawbacks. The lowest denominator between all common toolkits would have to be used, making it fairly limited, but it might be a good option for simpler applications.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[通过安全的网络连接在远程计算机上调用命令或程序。


有一天，我正在测试如何在 将文件或目录复制到多个位置和系统时保持完整的文件权限。当我想检查远程系统上的文件权限时，我必须通过 SSH 登录它并检查属性。从远程系统多次登录和注销的过程让我有点烦，我想，如果我可以在远程 Linux 系统上通过 SSH 执行命令就好了。

幸运的是，在浏览了 ssh 命令的手册页后，我找到了一个解决办法。

如果你想知道如何本地运行远程系统上运行命令或脚本，而不登录到远程系统，下面的内容会告诉你如何做。

1、通过 SSH 在远程 Linux 系统上执行命令

从本地系统通过 SSH 在远程系统上运行命令或脚本的典型方法是：

$ ssh <username@IP_Address-or-Doman_name> <Command-or-Script>


允许我给你们举几个例子：

1.1、通过 SSH 在远程系统上运行单个命令

假设你想要 查找远程 Linux 系统的内核详细信息。为此，只需运行：

$ ssh sk@192.168.225.22 uname -a


这里，


sk 是远程系统的用户名，

192.168.225.22 是远程系统的 IP 地址，

uname -a 是我想在远程系统上运行的命令。


示例输出：



看到没？我并没有实际登录到远程系统，但通过 SSH 在远程系统上执行了 uname 命令，并在本地系统的终端上显示了输出。

你还可以像下面这样用引号指定命令。

$ ssh sk@192.168.225.22 "uname -a"


或者，

$ ssh sk@192.168.225.22 'uname -a'


如果你已经 更改了 SSH 协议的默认端口，只需使用 -p 参数指定它。

意大利移动应用开发商 Bending Spoons 公司今天宣布收购印象笔记（Evernote）。在收购的新闻稿中说，“印象笔记拥有约 1 亿美元的经常性收入，数百万付费客户，以及使用其跨平台应用程序创建的近 110 亿条笔记。”印象笔记曾经是最流行的笔记应用之一，但在 2016 年开始限制免费用户的使用。在同一年还宣布开发了可以审查用户笔记的 AI，以及让其员工可以访问用户笔记，虽然在招致巨大反对后取消了计划，但也导致了大量用户流失。如今，在 iOS 上，它甚至没有跻身生产力应用程序的前 100 名。收购宣告没有公开收购金额等细节。

老王点评：我还是觉得之前的目标更务实一些，目前的 KDE 虽然已经很棒了，但是距离最好还有一些距离。

        <link href="https://www.williamlong.info/archives/6995.html"/>
        <updated>2022-11-17T05:18:13.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[11月17日，动视暴雪（简称暴雪）投资者官网发布消息称，由于与网易公司的现行许可协议将于2023年1月23日到期，将暂停在中国大部分暴雪游戏服务。包括魔兽世界、炉石传说、魔兽争霸III：重制版、守望先锋、星际争霸系列、暗黑破坏神 III和风暴英雄。


《暗黑破坏神：不朽》的共同开发和发行则涉及两家公司另外的单独协议。暴雪总裁迈克 伊巴拉（Mike Ybarra）表示，公司正寻找替代方案。2008年8月，暴雪与网易达成代理协议，此后多次续约，双方累计合作长达14年。


“近20年来，我们一直通过网易和其他合作伙伴将我们的游戏带到中国，我们非常感谢中国社区展现出的热情，”暴雪总裁迈克 伊巴拉（Mike Ybarra）表示，“他们的热情和创造力激励着我们，我们正在寻找替代方案，以便在未来将我们的游戏带回给玩家。”


11月17日上午，网易港股跌超10%。


对此，网易方面在接受《证券日报》记者采访时表示，“网易一直在尽最大努力和动视暴雪公司谈判，希望推进续约。经过长时间的谈判，我们仍然无法就一些合作的关键性条款与动视暴雪达成一致。我们非常遗憾动视暴雪在今天先行宣布了停止合作，我们将不得不接受此决定。网易将继续履行职责，为我们的玩家服务到最后一刻。”


对于玩家游戏资产处理，网易回应称，公司后续会发声明通知玩家，以玩家公告为准，具体情况目前不方便透露。


关于暴雪与网易的续约风波，据观察者网援引知情人士报道，暴雪方针对续约提出的条件包括，暴雪方分成较2019-2022合约期50%以上营收和净利润提高，暴雪还要求网易按照《暗黑破坏神：不朽》模式，研发暴雪其他IP手游全球发行，但网易只享有中国区市场营收分成。同时，暴雪还要求网易缴纳巨额保证金或预付费用来担保第2条的完成，否则将被“处罚”。


据“界面新闻”报道，有接近暴雪中国的人士向其透露，“要求网易打白工”的说法不实。观察者网的报道所述三点均明显不符实际：在分成上，暴雪并未狮子大开口，要求进一步大幅提高分成比例 ；而在游戏定价收费上，暴雪也未要求网易执行全球同步策略，即在中国区提价。


在双方停止合作后，若暴雪想要更换中国代理商，则需要面临正在运营的游戏的版号需要调整的问题。北京元合律师事务所合伙人、游戏法专家孙磊向记者表示，如果《魔兽世界》《炉石传说》等游戏因为本次授权合约到期而停服，那么就意味着此前其取得的版号作废；但如果暴雪找到了新的合作商，且网易愿意提供配合，那么做好变更登记后，原有的版号仍可沿用。


据了解，此前网易与暴雪共同成立了上海网之易网络科技发展有限公司，致力于暴雪旗下《魔兽世界》《星际争霸2》等游戏在中国大陆的运营，相关游戏的电竞赛事组织运营也由网之易主导，据业内人士透露，网之易公司内部员工存在分别隶属于网易和暴雪的两套班底。


暴雪对网易正式发出“分手函”后，其下一个代理商将花落谁家，成为了资本市场和游戏圈颇为关注的话题。“目前可以透露的是，有不止一家国内游戏厂商在争夺暴雪在中国的代理权，但暴雪似乎还没有做出最后的选择。”一位不愿具名的游戏公司员工表示。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[路透社报道，推特新老板马斯克(Elon Musk)在一封电子邮件中告诉员工，他们必须决定是否愿意留下并“在高强度下长时间工作”，或者接受离职补偿。在发出这一最后通牒之前，马斯克已在本月早些时候解雇了这家社交媒体公司大约一半的员工。


根据《华尔街日报》看到的这封电邮，员工必须在美东时间周四下午5点前填写一份谷歌表格，表明他们是否愿意留在Twitter，接受高强度的工作。


马斯克前夜在一封电子邮件中写道：“今后，为了打造出一个突破性的Twitter 2.0，并在一个竞争日益激烈的世界中取得成功，我们需要采取非常硬核的工作态度。这将意味着在高强度下长时间工作。只有出色的表现才能取得合格的成绩。”





在发出这封电邮之前，马斯克上周给员工发了一份备忘录，警告说公司面临严峻的经济挑战，他在备忘录中说破产是一种可能性。《华尔街日报》看到了这份备忘录。另据知情人士透露，同样在上周，马斯克在10月底接管Twitter后的首次全体员工会议上谈到了结束大多数员工的远程工作选项，这位亿万富豪称，员工需要在条件允许的情况下回到办公室上班。


推特近期刚无预警解雇约4400合约员工，以及近3700全职员工。


马斯克认为，推特是他以出售155亿美元（约212亿新元）特斯拉（Tesla）持股，以及承担数以10亿计美元债务的代价而“拯救”的公司。因此，在经济不景气下，如果推特不开始赚更多钱，公司就可能破产。他也要求员工停止居家办公，且每周工作80小时。

在过去几年内，我有幸和中学生们一起，并带他们入门 Python 开发 和树莓派 400。这一切都很有趣，树莓派对于学生和我来说都是一个很好的平台。我们使用了 Code with Mu，并且一切都很成功。我们的 Python 技能随着经验的增长而增长，因此最近我开始寻找给这些学生提供更多东西的方法。

我参与了一个 Python 课程并在课程中接触了微软的 Visual Studio Code。我在课程中学到了很多关于如何为 Python 设置虚拟环境，以及如何为 Python 编程配置 VS Code 的知识。在学习过程中，我也认识了 Codium，它基本上是没有微软品牌和遥测的 VS Code。

如果你正在寻找一个优秀的、通用的、开源的、带有 Python 集成的代码编辑器，那么你可以尝试一下 Codium。下面是我在 Linux 系统上为 Python 设置 Codium 的方法。

在 Linux 上安装或更新 Python

首先，确保你正在运行最新版本的 Python。你可以使用你的软件包管理器来完成这项工作。在 Debian 和基于 Debian 的系统上：

$ sudo apt install python3-pip


在 Fedora、CentOS、Mageia、OpenMandriva 和类似的系统上：

$ sudo dnf update python3


在某些系统上，你可能还需要安装创建 Python 虚拟环境的软件：

$ sudo apt install python3.10-venv


安装 Codium

接下来，在你的电脑上 安装 Codium。在 Linux 上，你可以下载一个包…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[在这篇文章中，我们将逐步解释如何在 RHEL 9 系统上安装 Node.js。


Node.js 基于谷歌的 V8 JavaScript 引擎构建，它是一个自由开源的跨平台 JavaScript 运行时环境，主要用于构建服务器端应用。它使用事件驱动和异步模型，帮助开发人员构建高度可扩展的数据密集型的实时应用（RTA）。你可以使用 NodeJS 来构建前端和后端应用。

Node.js 通常用于构建以下应用：


聊天应用

流媒体应用

浏览器游戏

命令行工具

嵌入式系统


在其技术栈中使用 NodeJS 的顶级公司包括 PayPal、NetFlix 和 Uber 等等。

安装 Node.js 主要有以下三种方式：


从 NodeSource 仓库安装 Node.js

从发行版的官方仓库安装 Node.js

使用 NVM 安装 Node.js


让我们看看如何使用这些方法在 RHEL 9 上安装 Node.js。

先决条件：


最小化安装的 RHEL 9 系统

具有管理员权限的 sudo 用户

互联网连接

Red Hat 订阅或本地配置的仓库


从 NodeSource 存储库安装 Node.js

NodeSource 是一家技术公司，旨在帮助组织运行生产就绪的 Node.js 应用，关注资源使用以及增强的安全性和应用程序性能。它提供了最新版本的 Node.js 和 NPM。

要从 NodeSource 安装 Node.js，首先，按如下所示更新系统包。

$ sudo dnf update -y




接下来，安装这期间所需的构建工具。其中包括 GCC C/C++ 编译器、Perl 和 Python 调试器等等。

$ sudo dnf groupinstall 'Dev…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The high-frequency-trading (HFT) industry is rather tight-lipped about what
it does 
and how it does it, but PJ Waskiewicz of Jump Trading came to the Netdev 0x16 conference to try
to demystify some of that, especially with respect to its use of
networking.  He 
wanted to contrast the needs of HFT with those of the traditional networking
as it is used outside of the HFT space.  He also has some thoughts on what
the Linux kernel could do to help address those needs so that HFT companies
could move away from some of the custom code that is currently being
developed and maintained by multiple firms in the industry.]]></summary>

I'm Gabriel, founder of Meticulous.
Our mission is to make the world's code safe, performant and reliable. We're starting with a tool to catch JavaScript regressions in web applications with zero-effort from developers.
How it works: Insert a single line of JavaScript onto your site, and we record thousands of real user sessions. We then replay these sessions on new code to automatically catch bugs before they hit production. You can watch a 60-second demo at meticulous.ai.

 I am trying to run the Windows Powershell binary in Linux. There is a native Powershell available for Linux, but the available libraries for Linux PS differ from those available in Windows. E.g., some tools for ActiveDirectory and Excel are not available under Linux.
 Has anyone successfully run Windows PowerShell (current version) under Wine? This is for a command line utility that queries an ActiveDirectory server and outputs reports to Excel. I did write a Go version but unfortunately the folks who will maintain the code only know Powershell.
 I found some threads on WineHQ and on Reddit, but no walkthroughs. 
 https://forum.winehq.org/viewtopic.php?t=33963
 https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/pz28xz/running_windows_powershell_script_in_endeavour_os/
 I've tried with Winetricks and Bottles so far, but get DLL errors when launching. .NET and other libraries were installed. Others have copied DLLs from Windows to work around missing DLLs but this is not an option for me.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Michael and Yury here – we're building a no-code analytics platform for growth teams that automatically generates actionable data insights.
After working in the data space for many years, we realized there was still a huge gap in the marketing analytics market. Growth teams have so much marketing and advertising data, yet this siloed data is not actionable.
The existing BI and search-driven analytics solutions are designed for data-savvy people. In our experience (previously built an NLP company called FriendlyData), non-technical people just don't know what questions to ask.
So we decided to try a different approach: Narrative BI automatically generates a personalized feed of insights. You just need to connect your data sources (takes 2 min to set up), and you will get automated narratives, alerts, and reports in minutes.
We currently support UA, GA4, Google Ads, and Facebook Ads, but many more integrations will be added soon.
You can try it out for free and give feedback or roast it in the comments section. Just connect your data source, and you'll start getting narratives in 5 minutes.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Meta has announced
the open-source release of part of its internal source-code management
system, called Sapling.


	Sapling began 10 years ago as an initiative to make our monorepo
	scale in the face of tremendous growth. Public source control
	systems were not, and still are not, capable of handling
	repositories of this size. Breaking up the repository was also out
	of the question, as it would mean losing monorepo’s benefits, such
	as simplified dependency management and the ability to make broad
	changes quickly. Instead, we decided to go all in and make our
	source control system scale.

	Starting as an extension to the Mercurial open source project, it
	rapidly grew into a system of its own with new storage formats,
	wire protocols, algorithms, and behaviors. Our ambitions grew along
	with it, and we began thinking about how we could improve not only
	the scale but also the actual experience of using source control.


At this point, only the client side of the system has been released; the
company "hopes to" release the rest later.]]></summary>

 This will interest those who do Game Dev on Linux, not only was 5.1.0 released, but we also officially have got the Quixel Plugin for Linux.
 To say, not so long ago we had to compile the engine every update ourselves, so precompiled engine is great to have. This is a huge step forward with UE.
 Some of the notable improvements on the Linux side of things are to do with Clion & Rider detection on this patch.

一百年前的实体书如果保存良好，可以正常阅读。但十年前的电子书今天去阅读极有可能会遇到各种问题。电子书需要不断维护，从文件格式到存储介质的不断变化，需要不断重新处理。电子书是脆弱且受到威胁的。

老王点评：这是一个违反直觉的事情，但是确实如此，所以，我们应该用一种明文的开放格式来承载这些电子书。




16 台晶圆级芯片计算机集群组成千万核超算

制造世界上最大的芯片 —— 晶圆级引擎 2（WSE-2）的公司 Cerebras 今天公布了其仙女座超级计算机。仙女座是由 16 个 WSE-2 芯片组成的，共有 1350 万个计算核心，比世界顶级超级计算机 Frontier 系统多出百分之六十，AI 算力与 Frontier 相当。全套系统功耗 500 千瓦，这比同等级的超级计算机的功率要低得多。


消息来源：Venture Beat



老王点评：16 块脸盆大的芯片组成的超算，在 AI 算力上与世界第一超算相当。




美国的 Frontier 超算继续占据 TOP500 榜首

第 60 版 TOP500 显示，Frontier 系统仍然是名单上唯一拥有 Exaflop 级别算力的超级计算机。Frontier 的 HPL 分数和之前一样，1.102 EFlop/s，但是确是第二名的三倍。之前连续两年占据榜首的日本富岳超级计算机依旧保持第二名。中国排名前十的两台超算依旧是神威-太湖之光和天河-2A。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[据《每日邮报》11月15日报道，据知情人士透露，马斯克似乎在进一步削减成本，即将准备让推特员工自费在公司食堂用餐，而此前推特食堂是免费的，这招引来员工的愤怒。


亿万富翁马斯克在上个月以440亿美元的交易额正式接管了推特。此后，他解雇了推特首席执行官，并解雇了公司一半的员工，包括数千名合同工。


继裁员计划后，特斯拉CEO马斯克又在考虑新的成本削减措施，计划取消推特旧金山总部的免费午餐，转而让员工付费。他在推特上称，在过去的12个月里，每顿午餐的成本预计超过400美元，使得旧金山总部的年度餐饮服务成本达到约1300万美元。


马斯克的这番言论招致了推特前员工雷西·霍金斯（Tracy Hawkins）的强烈反对。霍金斯之前是推特负责“工作转型”（work transformation）的副总裁，负责推特总部的免费午餐计划。霍金斯称，事实上每人每天的餐费约为20美元至25美元。


此外，在员工入住率（员工到公司办公）方面，霍金斯和马斯克也存在着分歧。马斯克表示，员工的最高入住率为25%，而平均入住率不到10%。而霍金斯对这些数字提出了质疑，称办公室的入住率在20%到50%之间。


马斯克回应称：“记录显示员工最高在岗率为25%，平均在岗率低于10%。准备早餐的人比吃早餐的人多。他们甚至懒得提供晚餐，因为楼里没人。”


此前几天，马斯克解雇了数千名负责筛选网站上错误信息的合同工。一些合同工说，他们直到周六无法上班时，才意识到自己被解雇了。据科技网站《平台》的记者凯西牛顿称，5500名合同工中约有4400人被解雇。


在考虑取消免费午餐之际，马斯克数日前刚刚致信推特员工称，称公司将取消远程办公，无特殊情况，员工每周至少要在办公室工作40个小时。

下载 Fedora Linux 37


两个新的版本

Fedora 的各个“版本Edition”是针对某一特定“市场”的旗舰产品。在 Fedora Linux 37 中，我们增加了两个新版本：Fedora CoreOS 是你可能还记得的 Atomic Host 的后续版本。从 Project Atomic 和 CoreOS 的初始的工作中汲取营养，它提供了一种自动更新机制，以托管基于容器的工作负载。通过原子更新和简单的回滚，它为你的基础设施增加了安全感。

Fedora Cloud 也作为一个版本回来了。云计算工作组的活动已经重新开始了。Cloud 版本提供了一个很棒的 Fedora 基础，可以在你喜欢的公共或私有云中运行。AMI 将在本周晚些时候在 AWS 市场上提供，在社区频道上现在已经可以使用。请查看 此网站 以了解可以在其他云供应商或你自己的云上运行的镜像！

桌面的改进

Fedora Workstation 专注于桌面体验。像往常一样，Fedora Workstation 采用了最新的 GNOME 版本。GNOME 43 在设置中包括一个新的设备安全面板，为用户提供关于系统中硬件和固件的安全信息。在上一个版本的基础上，更多的 GNOME 核心应用程序被移植到了最新版本的 GTK 工具包，提供了更好的性能和现代的外观。

在这个版本中，我们做了一些改变，让你的安装变得更精简。我们把 Firefox 浏览器的语言包分成了子包。这意味着如果你不需要本地化，你可以删除 firefo…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Linux Mint 的更新管理器变得更有用了！




Linux Mint 的更新管理器是该发行版的一个重要组成部分，它使新用户可以获得更为方便简易的体验。

最近的一次更新 Linux Mint 21 推出了许多改进，包括更新管理器对 Flatpak 的支持。

你只需要更新你的系统就可以获得这些改进。

⭐ 更新管理器中支持 Flatpak



是的，你没看错。这终于实现了。

Flatpak 支持已被添加到更新管理器中，用户只需单击几下就能更新 Flatpak 应用程序和运行时。

这将为进一步改善用户体验的统一更新体验提供了帮助。

这对新用户来说很有好处，他们不需要熟悉终端命令就能更新 Flatpak。此外，你不需要将 Flatpak 与软件中心集成（对于 GNOME 而言）。

换句话说，Linux Mint 团队增强了你使用 Flatpak 应用程序的体验。

除了对 Flatpak 的支持，本次更新还包括对 Linux Mint 21 的更多增强，这是一个开箱即用的更新。

这些改进包括：

对角栏的改进



Linux Mint 21 中的 角栏Corner Bar 添加了两项新特性：


能够在角栏设置左键点击和中键点击的动作；你可以配置它以显示桌面、工作区选择器或桌面。

一个允许你将鼠标悬停在角栏上以显示桌面的新选项。


Nemo 的更新



Nemo 文件管理器做了一些调整；现在，当文件被选中时，只会高亮显示文件名，而不是图标和文件名。

如果你还不知道, 你也可以通过我们建议的一些调整来增强 Nemo 文件管理器的体验：


调整 Linux 中的 Nemo 文件管理器，让它更好用的 15 种方法


此外，桌面图标被垂直翻转，桌面上下文菜单中添加了一个新的快捷方式，可以快速打开显示设置。

更少的密码提示

这是很多人可能喜欢的另一个用户体验调整。

当删除 Flatpak 或任何快捷方式或本地应用程序时，它将不再要求你输入密码。

类似地，在新立得（LCTT 译注：Linux 下的一个包管理工具）和更新管理器的情况下，将使用 pkexec 来记住密码。

这样，用户就不需要每次执行多个操作时都输入密码。

你可以浏览 Linux Mint 月度博客 以了解其它变化。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The scalability of Linus Torvalds was a
recurring theme during Linux's early years; these days maintainer struggles
are a recognized problem within open-source
communities in general.  It is thus not surprising that Sean Christopherson
gave a talk at Open Source Summit Europe (and KVM Forum) with the title
"Scaling KVM and its community".  The talk mostly focused on KVM for the
x86 architecture—the largest and most mature KVM architecture—which
Christopherson 
co-maintains.  But it was not a technical talk: most of the content can be
applied to other KVM architectures, or even other Linux subsystems, so that
they can avoid making the same kinds of mistakes.]]></summary>

We've made a “data lake” (industry jargon for a large data store with lots of heterogeneous data) that’s optimized for deep learning. Keeping your data in an AI-optimized format means you can ship AI models faster, without having to build complex data infrastructure for image, audio, and video data (check out our GitHub here: https://github.com/activeloopai/deeplake).
Deep Lake stores complex data such as images, audio, videos, annotations/labels, and tabular data, in the form of tensors—a type of data structure used in linear algebra, which AI systems like to consume.
We then rapidly stream the data into three destinations: (a) a SQL-like language (Tensor Query Language) that you can use to query your data; (b) an in-browser…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[11月15日下午消息，去年5月，多家媒体报道称，郑州车主温先生自称花150万买的特斯拉Model X在高速行驶中突然降速，且刹车失灵。该车主希望特斯拉承认刹车系统出问题，并对他进行道歉。


当时，特斯拉回应称，初步诊断车辆报警原因为右前轮速传感器警报，并非温先生所述的“刹车失灵”。


特斯拉还称，车主向特斯拉提出免费更换至新款Model X车型的诉求，但特斯拉对此无法予以满足。


但不久后，一段网上流传的疑似温先生与他人对话录音显示，温先生疑似自己“策划”了这场维权行动，目的是通过舆论压力，使特斯拉对其进行“一赔三”。


随后，特斯拉以侵犯名誉权为由，将温先生告上法庭。


近日，该案件宣判。民事判决书显示，原告特斯拉胜诉。


据判决书显示，河南省郑州市管城回族区人民法院认定温先生的言论侵害了特斯拉汽车（北京）公司的名誉权。法院判决，温先生需在《河南法制报》上向特斯拉公开道歉，并支付赔偿款1万元。]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[你可以通过以下方式确定你的 Linux 发行版中是否正在运行 systemd 或其它初始化系统。


首个进程在你启动 Linux 发行版时开始运行，它称为初始化进程 init（初始化initialization的缩写）。它的进程标识符为 1（即 pid=1）。基于 Unix 的系统中的所有进程和应用程序都是这个初始化进程的后代。

根据功能和特性，存在不同类型的初始化进程。例如，systemd、Runit、OpenRC、sysVinit 等。其中，systemd 是最流行和最现代的一种，被包括 Ubuntu 和 Fedora 在内的所有现代 Linux 发行版使用和采用。

与传统的基于 Unix 的初始化系统相比，systemd 及其性能一直存在争议。但这就是另外一个话题了。

让我们看看如何确定在 Linux 发行版中运行的是 systemd 还是其它初始化系统。

systemd 还是其它初始化系统？

不幸的是，没有直接的命令可以找到它。你可以从初始化进程追溯它，它基本上是到 /sbin/init 的符号链接，即 pid=1。

使用 strings 命令打印嵌入在二进制文件 /sbin/init 中的文本并使用以下命令搜索 init：

strings /sbin/init | grep init


示例 1

在下面的输出中，它是一个运行 Debian（Peppermint OS）的 sysVinit 系统。如你所见，它清楚地显示了 init 进程名称。

strings /sbin/init | grep init




如果在上述同一个系统中找 systemd，那么不会有任何结果。因此，你可以得出结论，你正在运行 sysVinit 而不是 systemd。

示例 2

如果你在 systemd 系统中运行上述命令，你可以在输出的第一行轻松看到 systemd 及其版本。

strings /sbin/init | grep systemd




示例 3

你也可以尝试使用 pstree 命令打印进程树，它应该会显示第一个进程名称。它应该是 systemd 或 init，如下例所示。

pstree






这就好了。这样你就可以轻松找出你的发行版是使用 systemd 还是其他的。

1962 年夏天，美国宇航局启动了水手 1 号任务，这是一项无人驾驶的任务，该装置将飞过金星并探测数据。当时的工程师通常在纸上写出他们的代码。然后这些代码通过一个复杂的系统被翻译成计算机可读的卡片，然后通过计算机执行该程序。这种手工使得意外错误率变得很高。缺失的符号与字符最终导致了水手 1 号任务的彻底失败。这次任务在当时花费了大约 1800 万美元，相当于今天的 1.5 亿美元。

老王点评：计算机发展早期，不说流程，就是工具也很简陋。但是就是这样，也送上天那么多飞行器。




一个简单的安卓锁屏漏洞获得了 7 万美元

研究人员发现，任何能拿到谷歌 Pixel 手机的人都可以通过换上自己的 SIM 卡，并输入预设的恢复代码，从而绕过安卓操作系统的锁屏保护。这个漏洞的利用非常简单，但谷歌花了大约五个月的时间来修复。谷歌为此向他支付了 7 万美元的奖金。

老王点评：看似这个钱挣的容易，但是实际上研究人员投入了大量精力才可能遇到这样一块“狗头金”。




英特尔推出深度伪造实时检测工具

深度伪造视频现在无处不在，你可能见过名人做或说他们实际上从未做过的事情的视频。英特尔开发了 FakeCatcher，这项技术能够以 96% 的准确率检测虚假人脸视频。这是世界上第一个实时深度伪造检测器，它可以在几毫秒内返回结果。该工具是通过检测视频像素中微妙的“血流”信号，在真实视频中寻找真实的线索。当心脏泵血时，人的静脉会改变颜色，这些血流信号是可以从面部各处收集的，算法将这些信号翻译成时空图。然后，利用深度学习，就可以立即检测出一个视频是真的还是假的。

老王点评：果然魔高一尺，道高一丈。不过我想深度伪造可能很快就会学会添加血流信号。]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you want to use a terminal based file manager over ssh (lf or ranger), but the server doesn't have ranger in the repos (synology NAS), or you don't have sudo privileges to install it on the server, here's a solution:
 Use sshfs to mount that server path.
 sudo mkdir /mnt/server Or any directory name you want.
 Run id and take note of your uid and gid. 
 Change ownership of that directory so that it doesn't require sudo anymore:
 sudo chown -r uid:gid /mnt/server 
 Now you can see and edit that path with your regular user. 
 sshfs <username>@<ip_address>:/path/ /mnt/server
 If you want to use your RSA key instead, so that you don't have to type the password every time do:
 sshfs -o IdentityFile=/path/to/.ssh/private_key \ <username>@<ip_address>:/path/ /mnt/server 
 You can now browse to it from ranger or lf, then bookmark it with the m key.
 To have a shortcut in the home directory, run: ln -s "/mnt/server" "$HOME/server"
 To un-mount it, do: fusermount -u /mnt/server
 The reason I like to use ranger over ssh, is the same reason I like to use it locally. It's incredibly faster to navigate using ranger than any GUI file manager, plus I have access to vim in case I want to bulk rename, or edit dotfiles, and other cool keybinds set to other stuff.
 I hope you found this helpful. :)

I'm familiar with inodes, directories and data blocks at a conceptual level, but would love a tool that would allow me to explore my live filesystem and show the contents of all the inodes and directory entries (displaying the rec_len, name_len, etc fields).
 Does such a learning tool exist? Or are there tools that can dump these entries and inodes?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Since there's no clear term for these, by Utility Distro I mean distros designed to be stored only on a USB key and exclusively Live-booted, to serve particular use cases or tasks.
 For instance, I've found:
 Parted Magic: Collection of programs and tools to detect, repair or recover data from corrupt hard drives. Unfortunately paid.
 GRUB Boot Repair Tool: As the name implies. Just repairs or reinstalls GRUB on an existing system. Saved my laptop twice with this.
 Puppy Linux: Very lightweight Distro designed to be ran on old or low spec PCs. Used it to backup all the files from my very first PC (With only 256MB of RAM!) and it didn't take an hour just to boot. 
 I've got all these on my Ventoy USB and would love to build a set of useful Distros like these just for the sake of it.

Mainly the inability to present my screen on Google Meet conversations on Chromium and being unable to use color pickers. Two things I do very frequently. Have those been fixed?
 I am considering switching again eventually, so what is the state of Wayland currently? Is the experience currently on par with X11 or are there problems average users will eventually face if they switch now?
 What still needs to be fixed/polished on Wayland before the user experience for most people is better than X11's?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm a big fan of shell scripts. What I missed is a CLI "calculator". But not just to do simple operations on numbers. It would be nice to have some Computer Algebra System available through CLI.
 For impatient - github
 So I made such a tool. Here's a simple use case:  $ amcli eval "1 / 2" 0.5 $ amcli eval "e ^ pi > pi ^ e" True 
 Here's differentation:  $ amcli diff x "sin(x) + b * ln(x)" cos(x) + 1 / x * b 
 Let's solve some equation  $ amcli solve x "a x^3 = b" (b / a) ^ (1/3) (-1/2 + i * 1/2 * sqrt(3)) * (b / a) ^ (1/3) (-1/2 + i * sqrt(3/4) * (-1)) * (b / a) ^ (1/3) 
 Let's convert to LaTeX:  $ amcli latex "1/2 + sqrt(3)" \frac{1}{2}+\sqrt{3} 
 We can also pipe:  $ echo "sin(x) + cos(x)" | amcli sub x "y/z" | amcli diff y cos(y / z) * z / z ^ 2 + -sin(y / z) * z / z ^ 2  (so we substituted y/z instead of x and then differentiated over y)
 So let's quickly compute the gradient of a neural network with MSE loss function!  echo "[ x_1, x_2, x_3 ]" \ | amcli sub X _ "[[ w_11, w_12, w_13 ], [ w_21, w_22, w_23 ], [ w_31, w_32, w_33 ]] * X" \ | amcli fsimp \ | amcli sub X _ "e ^ X / (1 + e ^ X)" \ | amcli fsimp \ | amcli sub X _ "[ v_1, v_2, v_3 ]T * X" \ | amcli fsimp \ | amcli sub pred _ "(pred - target)^2" \ | amcli diff w_21 \ | amcli fsimp 
 Why?
 To automate tasks in shell. That means, it's computer algebra which is language-agnostic. Simple example: some plugin for text editor to replace LaTeX code instead of a formula when selected.
 It's also simple, small (8.7 M by the time of writing this) and with nearly-zero startup overhead.
 It's finally free, under GNU GPL v3. I also intend to make it more cross-platform (right now it's only available for win-x64, linux-x64, osx-64).

 Releases to try it out!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[大家好！今年早些时候，我在写《DNS 是如何工作的》 时，有人问我——为什么人们有时在域名的末尾加一个点？例如，如果你通过运行 dig example.com 查询 example.com 的 IP，你会看到一下内容：

$ dig example.com
example.com.        5678    IN  A   93.184.216.34


执行完 dig 命令后，example.com 有一个 . ——变成了 example.com.！发生了什么？

有些 DNS 工具也要求传给它的域名后加一个 .：如果你在使用 miekg/dns 时传给它 example.com，它会报错：

// trying to send this message will return an error
m := new(dns.Msg)
m.SetQuestion("example.com", dns.TypeA)


最初我以为我知道这个问题的答案（“呃，末尾的点意味着域名是完全限定的？”）。这是对的 —— 一个完全限定域名fully qualified domain name（FQDN）是一个末尾有 . 的域名！

但是为什么末尾的点是有用且重要的呢？

在 DNS 的请求/响应中，域名的末尾并没有 “.”

我曾经（错误地）认为 “为什么末尾有一个点？”的答案可能是 “在 DNS 请求/响应中，域名末尾有一个 .，所以我们把它放进去，以匹配你的计算机实际发送/接收的内容”。但事实并不是这样！

当计算机发送 DNS 请求/响应时，域名的末尾并没有点。实际上，域名中没有点。

域名会被编码成一系列的长度/字符串对。例如，域名 example.com 被编码为这 13 个字节。

7example3com0


编码后的内容一个点也没有…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[本指南介绍了如何在没有互联网连接的情况下离线更新 Ubuntu 的步骤。


在很多情况下，你可能需要在没有互联网连接的情况下更新你的 Ubuntu 系统。你可能在外地不方便上网，也可能你需要更新一堆未联网的 Ubuntu，不管是哪种情况，保持你的系统更新最新的软件包总是需要的。

当然，始终建议通过联网来更新系统。

但有时，出于安全考虑，这是不行的。连接到互联网可能需要给你的系统进行额外的加固，以保护它们免受黑客和恶意软件的攻击。

以下的方法使用 apt-offline 来解决这些问题，并概述了在没有互联网的情况下离线更新 Ubuntu 的步骤。

准备环节


一台能连接到网络的 Ubuntu（你朋友的、咖啡馆、实验室系统）

存储了软件包的 U 盘

两个系统都安装了 apt-offline：一个系统离线，另一个系统联网


安装 apt-offline

在两个系统下安装 apt-offline。你可以使用以下命令安装：

sudo apt install apt-offline


如果你想在离线的目标系统安装 apt-offline，你可以提前下载到 U 盘里，然后复制到目标系统，再使用下面的命令安装。

Ubuntu 22.04 LTS 和其他版本的下载链接如下所示。你可以选择一个镜像并下载 deb 文件。


下载 .deb 文件 – apt-offline


sudo dpkg -i name_of_package.deb


如何更新 Ubuntu

在离线的目标系统上打开终端，使用以下命令创建一个 .sig 签名文件：

sudo apt-offline set ~/offline-data.sig




在这个刚创建的签名文件中，包含下载所需的软件包的路径和详细信息。



把签名文件复制到 U 盘中，再插到联网的 Ubuntu 系统上。

在联网的 Ubuntu 上创建一个目录（参见下面）来存放这些文件。

打开一个终端，运行以下命令来下载所需的软件包。记得根据你的系统，更改下载目录和 .sig 签名文件的路径。

apt-offline get -d ~/offline-data-dir offline-data.sig




你可以看到文件相应下载，然后复制整个下载目录到 U 盘，再插到离线的 Ubuntu 系统。

运行以下命令将下载的软件包安装到离线系统，记得根据你的系统更改目录路径。

sudo apt-offline install offline-data-dir/




如果一切顺利，你将获得一个更新完的 Ubuntu。

重复以上步骤，就可以保持你的离线 Ubuntu 为最新版本。

希望以上教程能帮到你更新离线的 Ubuntu 系统，如果你遇到任何问题，请在下面的评论框中告诉我。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[据报道，知情人士透露，从本周开始，亚马逊计划对企业和技术部门裁员1万人。这将成为该公司迄今为止规模最大的一次裁员。知情人士称，此次裁员将占亚马逊公司员工的3%左右。由于亚马逊正在内部审核各个业务的优先级，所以具体数字可能会有所变化。


知情人士表示，这家美国零售巨头计划对其设备部门（负责生产Alexa系列语音控制设备和家居安全摄像头）、人力资源和零售部门进行裁员，但目前还不清楚他们具体将在何时通知员工。知情人士将亚马逊及其他公司最近的裁员归咎于不确定的宏观经济环境。


美国科技公司经历了多年的快速招聘后，近期却因为担心经济衰退而展开了一系列裁员。就在上周，Facebook母公司Meta Platforms表示将裁员逾1.1万人，约占其员工总数的13%。


亚马逊预计，在通常利润丰厚的假日季期间，该公司的销售额增长将会有所放缓。


该公司CFO布莱恩·奥尔萨夫斯基（Brian Olsavsky）在上月的一次电话会议上表示，亚马逊发现，美国的家庭购物预算出现紧缩，他们仍将继续与高企的通胀率和能源成本做斗争。


亚马逊随后透露，他们将会在未来几个月冻结增量公司招聘。


上周有报道称，亚马逊的设备部门近年来的年度运营亏损超过50亿美元。由于部分用户只用语音助理来完成为数不多的几项任务，所以亚马逊也在考虑是否要专注于Alexa的新功能。


如果将仓库和物流员工都计算在内，截至9月30日，亚马逊的员工总数超过150万人。照此计算，此次裁员不到其员工总数的1%。

 github: github.com/sayan01/present
 Small and precise syntax: $ for banner text, # for title, ! for image, @ for links, - for list items
 the source file is compiled into a pdf which is ready to be presented with one command:
 present source.pre 
 I know this looks like latex+beamer or suckless/sent. That is because it was inspired by them, but this is (according to me) better than them for making presentations. Latex is for writing papers and is the best at it, adding a doc-class to it to make it render presentations is overkill for the job. It has too many complex syntax to learn and still to many options for styling. If the user is spending time on the style of the slides, he has forgetten why slides are made: to augment and aid their presentation, not be the spotlight. Presentations should be simple and to the point, without unnecesary animations and flairs. Sent does a very good job doing just that. The problem is sent does not compile into a pdf or any other portable format, rather creates an X window. so sent is a dependency on the system used to present the slides, which is not always possible to meet. present compiles the source code into a pdf, which is universally portable and almost all devices and OS support pdf. even browsers can render pdf. It also does not support links and image captions.
 present has very small syntax, which can be learnt in under a minute. These components, according to me, are enough for any presentation. The syntax is similar to markdown (sometimes easier than markdown). More details are there in the README of the github repository.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[英伟达采用形式验证来验证软件安全性

英伟达软件安全副总裁说，“面向测试的软件验证对安全来说根本不起作用，你可以对提供给用户的功能的质量有一个衡量标准，但对于安全问题，就没有什么作用，……很难知道你是否已经完成了。”幸运的是，有可能用数学方法证明你的代码的行为与它的规范精确一致。这个过程被称为“形式验证”。英伟达采用软件形式验证行业解决方案 SPARK 来证明软件的安全性。在几年前进行过概念验证后，现在许多英伟达产品在使用 SPARK 组件发布。


消息来源：AdaCore



老王点评：形式验证是个好方法，但是不是那么容易掌握和推行。




JavaScript、Java、Python、Kotlin 和 Rust 开发者增长惊人

根据 SlashData 去年夏天从 163 个国家的 26000 多名开发者调查统计而成的第 23 期《开发者国家报告》，JavaScript 仍然是最大的编程语言社区，全球估计有 1960 万开发者每天都在使用 JavaScript；在过去的两年里，Java 社区的规模已经从 830 万增加到 1650 万，而同期开发者只增加了 50%；Python 在过去两年中增加了约 800 万新的开发人员；Kotlin 和 Rust 社区的规模在过去两年里都翻了一番。


消息来源：ZDNet



老王点评：开发人员越来越倾向于使用主流开发工具，所以流行的越发流行，但是这样就会扼杀一些创新。




密码学家建议考虑非晶格的后量子密码算法

目前许多密码学系统的安全性是基于大数的因数分解的，但因数分解的一个怪癖使其容易受到量子计算机的攻击。因此人们对上世纪 90 年代提出的“晶格密码学”寄予厚望，美国 NIST 选择的四个后量子密码学标准有三个采用晶格密码学。RSA 算法名称中的 S，Adi Shamir 对此表示担忧，“从某种意义上说，我们是把所有鸡蛋放在同一个篮子里”。今年夏天早些时候，一个有前途的后量子密码学方案不是用量子计算机，而是用一台普通的笔记本电脑破解的。


消息来源：Slashdot



老王点评：确实如此，只有一种抗量子的密码理论，很难说会不会被发现潜在的弱点。]]></summary>

TTM then handles the lifetime, the movements and the CPU mapping of those objects (https://docs.kernel.org/gpu/drm-mm.html).
 Based on the kernel documentation, each DRM (Direct Rendering Manager) driver needs a memory manager. There are two memory managers supported by DRM: TTM and GEM (Graphics Execution Manager).

它们中的大多数都可以被划归为三个大类 : Debian、Red Hat（Fedora）以及 Arch Linux。

使用基于 Debian/Ubuntu、Red Hat/SUSE 或者 Arch 的 Linux 发行版自然有它们的优势。它们很受大众欢迎，因此它们的包管理器能够提供大量的软件包。

然而，有一些用户更倾向于使用从头开始构建、独立于 DEB/RPM 这类包管理系统之外的发行版。

在这篇文章当中，我们将列出一些优秀的独立 Linux 发行版。


注意 : 显然，下面的列表显然不会包括一些广受欢迎，通常作为创建新发行版的基础的发行版，如 Debian、Ubuntu 和 Fedora 等。此外，列表顺序不分先后，没有特定的排名。


1、NixOS



NixOS 最初发布于 2003 年，NixOS 建立在 Nix 包管理器之上。它每年发布两个版本，通常是在 5 月和 11 月。

NixOS 可能不是一个直接面向新用户或普通用户的发行版。然而，其独特的 包管理 方法吸引了各种用户。

此外，它仍然支持 32 位系统。

其他特性：


构建隔离的包

可靠的升级，并且具有回滚功能

可重现的系统配置



NixOS


2、Gentoo Linux



Geetoo Linux 是一个主要针对操作系统专家的独立 Linux 发行版。它是为那些希望自由定制、微调和优化操作系统以满足其要求的用户而构建。

Gentoo 使用 Portage 包管理器 来创建和安装软件包，通常还允许你针对你的硬件来优化它们。Chrome 的开源版本 Chromium OS 便是使用 Gentoo 作为其核心的。

不要忘记，Gentoo 是 仍然支持 32 位…]]></summary>

        <link href="https://linux.cn/article-15250-1.html?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss"/>
        <updated>2022-11-14T00:24:10.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[以下是如何在 Ubuntu 和其他 Linux 发行版中提高笔记本和桌面的音量的方法。


你有没有觉得你的 Ubuntu 笔记本的音量太小，尽管你把音量调到了 100%？我相信你有过。主要原因是：很明显，笔记本电脑的扬声器输出强度比大型扬声器要低。

此外，Ubuntu 和其他发行版将默认的最大音量设置为 100%，也就是 0dB（分贝）。0dB 是最大音量的参考值。做个比较，如果你把音量设置为 -10dB，这意味着你的音量比最大的 0dB 安静。

VLC 和一些媒体播放器允许你将音量提高到 200%。在最新的 Ubuntu 中使用一些设置，你可以将音量进一步提高。


注意：在你尝试和使用以下方法之前，请记住，每个扬声器都有其制造商设定的硬件限制。偶尔一次，播放超过 100% 的音频是可以的。但是，连续放大到更高的分贝可能会使输出的音频失真，并且从长远来看可能会损坏你的扬声器。因此，在使用时要小心谨慎，并有所限制。


在 Ubuntu 和其他发行版中提高扬声器音量

对于最新的 Ubuntu 22.04 及以上版本（GNOME）

从应用菜单中打开“设置Settings”，进入“声音Sound”标签。

启用 “过度放大Over Amplification” 开关。在你启用的那一刻，你应该看到音量条被扩大了。



现在你可以享受音量提升来听音乐了。

Fedora、Arch Linux 和其他发行版

如果你使用带有 GNOME 的 Fedora 工作站，你将看不到上述选项，因为这是 Ubuntu 特有的设置。见下面。



因此，对于任何其他 Linux 发行版（Arch、Fedora、RedHat 等）或桌面（KDE、Xfce、LXQt 等），打开终端并安装 PulseAudio 音量控制器。

Fedora、RedHat Linux、OpenSUSE 等基于 RPM 的发行版：

sudo dnf install pavucontrol


对于 Arch Linux、Manjaro：

sudo pacman -S pavucontrol


基于 Ubuntu 的非 GNOME 发行版：

sudo apt install pavucontrol


如何使用

安装后，从应用菜单中打开 pavucontrol，它应该有个 &ldquoulseAudio Volume Control” 菜单项。



总结

记住，上述方法可以提高整个系统的扬声器音量。这意味着系统的声音和警报也会受到影响。所以，要记住这一点。正如我前面提到的，如果连续使用，提升扬声器音量超过 100% 可能会导致扬声器变形或损坏。

我希望这个教程能帮助你提高系统音量。如果你遇到问题，请在评论栏里告诉我。
