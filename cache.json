          "description": "Hi HN community,\nI'm Marcus, a 17-year-old Software Engineer from Germany.\nFor the past two years I've been working on Tablane [0](https://github.com/Tablane/tablane) a task/project management tool, with features like:\n- Collaborative Editing (google docs)\n- Optimistic updates with RTK Query\n- Realtime sync with Socket.io\n- An awesome design\nLet me know what you think! Ask me anything!\nHow I got here:\n2020: I was developing a TTT [1] (Trouble in Terrorist Town) plugin for my minecraft server, when I started to require a project management tool to keep track of the features I wanted to implement, originally I used a text file, but after some time I started using products like ClickUp and Monday.\nBut not long after I hit several paywalls for features that I wanted to use (Custom Status, Limited Number of Boards, ...)\nSoon after Tablane (originally task-board) was born. I started building the website using plain HTML, then found out about React and completed Colt Steele's \"Web Developer Bootcamp\" [2] and \"The Modern React Bootcamp\" [3] and started re-writing Tablane in React, and started adding feature after feature.\nNow I am about to finish Highschool and originally I thought about applying to college and spending another 3-5 years there, but after the positive feedback I got on a three month internship I did at ContentPepper, and seeing how my own projects developed, I decided to look for open Developer positions, to work with a team of experienced developers so I can learn even faster.\nLinks:\n[0] https://tablane.net\n[1] https://github.com/MarconLP/TTT\n[2] https://www.udemy.com/course/modern-react-bootcamp/\n[3] https://www.udemy.com/course/the-web-developer-bootcamp/\nSocials:\nRésumé/CV: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1CbZi1Bm-MlDHEb4WjsFBzIBSomJ...\nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/marcus-hof/\nEmail: marcus (dot) hof (at) protonmail (dot)com\nGitHub: https://github.com/MarconLP\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/Marcon565\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34279062\nPoints: 186\n# Comments: 98",

Say \"ffmpeg\" for datasets and more.\nIt can resemble textql, octosql, dsq, duckdb, trdsql, q, datafusion-cli, spyql, but has better capabilities and performance.\nHere is a tutorial: https://clickhouse.com/blog/extracting-converting-querying-l...\n\"serverless\" in the same sense as here: https://www.sqlite.org/serverless.html\nand also in the more common sense - clickhouse-local can be packaged into AWS Lambda and serve queries on a per-request basis, as here: https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/43589\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34265206\nPoints: 144\n# Comments: 40",

          "description": "I wrote an RSS reader called RSS Brain recently. The motivate is the current RSS readers either don't sort articles by priority, which makes it hard to read posts from HackerNews and Reddit, or sort it with some \"smart\" algorithm which I don't trust. I also like the Google News feature that can show related story from different source, but the sources are not configurable and the algorithm is not transparent either. So with RSS Brain, I implemented these features:\n* Recommend related articles from the feeds of your choice. It's backed by ElasticSearch and the algorithm is described on RSS Brain's website.\n* Option to sort articles by upvotes and time. The algorithm is similar to the old Reddit and you can find it on the website as well.\n* Save search terms into folders so you can filter the articles.\nI've been using it for a while and found these features very helpful. So I want to share this on HackerNews. The frontend is written in Flutter so it has cross platform clients, even though the web version don't feel very \"web native\" because the level of Flutter web support. I guess only time can improve that.\nI don't have enough hardware to scale it up so it's currently in subscription mode to limit the users. I'm going to open source the code (maybe non-commercial license) once I think it's ready so you can host it by yourself. It's still in early stage and haven't been tested by a lot of people. So any feedback is helpful. Thanks!\nUpdate: Added a scroll down hint in the landing page.

          "description": "The topic of data recovery from broken phones seems to be a prime target from SEO optimised blogspam so I'm posting here in hopes that someone had a similar issue in the past and may be able to help me out.\nI am tasked with restoring some photos from a Huawei P30 that has a broken screen/touchpad. The photos were stored on the device directly, unfortunately not on an SD card or on a cloud provider. The phone does still turn on (it vibrates when plugged into a power outlet and shows up on Windows). However, it's only showing an installer for HiSuite (which did not help), not the file system. USB debugging is enabled.\nThings I tried so far and didn't work:\n- shining a flashlight at the screen to see if only the backlight is broken (it seems the whole screen is done for)\n- eyeballing it and trying to blindly enter the passcode\n- connecting phone to external monitor and keyboard via USB-C -> HDMI (monitor stays black)\nIs there anything that may still have a chance of working short of replacing the screen to unlock the phone? Thanks and happy holidays.\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34131436\nPoints: 44\n# Comments: 32",

          "description": "Just wanted to wish everybody here a Merry Christmas. HN is one of those Internet communities which I would be the saddest to see go, even looking back on other communities in which I've participated over the years.\nI see many posts here about loneliness, nihilism, friendships (or lack thereof) and just wanted to let everybody here know that life is never hopeless, and there are always people who care, even if they're thousands of miles away.\nPlease reach out to loved ones this season and let them know you love them. Life is short, and you never know when the last time you'll be wishing somebody a Merry Christmas will be.\nI wish you all the very best for 2023.\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34121082\nPoints: 966\n# Comments: 151",

          "description": "Last month, we open-sourced Infisical (https://github.com/Infisical/infisical) - a simple, end-to-end encrypted tool to sync environment variables across your team and infrastructure. You can use it to store environment variables and inject them into your applications locally or into CI/CD and production infrastructure. It can be used with any language/framework and is platform independent with a super easy setup.\nWe know secret managers exist but, in our experience, they’re too complicated, not comprehensive, not user-friendly, or a mix of all three — other nicer ones are closed-source and don’t have self-hosted options available. That’s why we’re on a mission to make secret management more accessible to every developer — not just security teams.\nWe’ve launched this repo under the MIT license so any developer can use the tool. The goal is to not charge individual developers. We make money by charging a license fee for some future enterprise features as well as providing a hosted version and support.\nIn the coming weeks, we plan to add features like key rotation, access logs + more integrations. We’d love to hear your thoughts and any feature requests!\nGive it a try (https://github.com/Infisical/infisical), and let us know what you think!\nMain website: https://infisical.com/\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34055132\nPoints: 160\n# Comments: 76",

          "description": "Not newspapers or media services (though those can be annoying too), but products in general? It feels like it's getting harder and harder to just buy something in the tech world, especially when it comes to running programs on my home computer. Want a password manager? It's a SaaS now. Note taking app? SaaS. Image editor or office suite? SaaS (thanks Adobe...)\nThis is especially annoying given I generally refuse to rent anything in life, and will go out of my way to buy something upfront simply so there's no risk of losing it if finances get worse in future (or the wrong billionaire buys the company). Yet it seems like it's getting harder to do so, especially when open source products don't exist for that domain.\nSo yeah, why is that? And is anyone else tired of the constant barrage of subscriptions for things that should be one off purchases?\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34041962\nPoints: 460\n# Comments: 339",

I'm pretty frustrated, and even given my near-complete disillusionment about capital-driven-tech these days, I can't believe Google is doing this.\nI just got home from being in Mexico where I used my VPN (because of course US financial apps panic if you access them outside the US).\nI fired up my LG TV running the YouTube app (which I'm not signed into) and every, single, ad is in Spanish.\nMy Edge browser on my desktop computer gives results in Mexico and claims I'm in Quintanna Roo. In many places, I cannot override this, at least without signing in and/or apparently explicitly feeding it more accurate location data to \"fix\" it's perception.\nIs this expected/known? At one point, it even said \"based on your IP address\" despite the fact that my IP clearly looks up to a Washington State IP address.\nI just wish I could make this known to Google's advertisers. Are they aware that when I travel, they're pay to show me ads that I can't understand?\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34032484\nPoints: 58\n# Comments: 50",

          "description": "I was born in the late 90s so by the time I got involved in technology, my introduction to Unix and Unix-flavored systems was limited to Linux and MacOS. However, I've read about the history of Unix at Bell Labs, the BSD systems derived from research Unix, and the eventual commercial releases of Unix System V from AT&T themselves. I also see that HP-UX, AIX, and Solaris are apparently still maintained and get releases, which suggests that they are still being used in production in some places.\nI'm curious if anyone here currently works (or has very recently worked) somewhere where proprietary Unix is still used for production. If so, can you tell me what they're used for and why those deployments haven't been moved to an appropriate Linux distribution?\nNot suggesting Linux is necessarily better for all use cases, just wondering what keeps these small number of entities clinging to closed-source Unix with presumably pricey license costs.\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34017934\nPoints: 64\n# Comments: 51",

          "description": "Hey HN, cofounder of Readwise here. We've been working on this cross-platform reader app for about 2 years, excited to finally share it in public beta.\nProbably the most notable thing that makes Reader unique is that it supports almost any content type you could want to save/read/highlight:\n* web pages\n* emails/newsletters\n* PDFs\n* ePubs\n* twitter threads\n* youtube videos (with transcripts)\n* RSS feeds\nWith all of your knowledge content in one place, we built powerful reading and highlighting, as well as a bunch of novel triage/organization features, so you can actually consume & stay on top of that content!\nThere are also a lot of advanced features too, such as text-to-speech, GPT3 questions/summaries, super powerful highlighting (that includes markup and images), complex filtering/search (with our own query language), sleek mobile triage UI, keyboard shortcuts for reading/everything, integrations with note-taking apps, a browser extension for both saving pages and highlighting them, and much more.\nIf anyone's interested in more product details, as well as our business model, etc, we wrote a detailed launch post: https://blog.readwise.io/the-next-chapter-of-reader-public-b...\nPredicting a common question: Reader is part of the Readwise subscription pricing right now in beta -- there's a 30 day free trial and then it's paid at ~$8usd/month. We also promise to not raise this price for existing subscribers.\nReader is also fairly technically interesting -- our iOS, Android and webapp all work fully offline and sync your reading data/progress with eachother. Our search on web is built with wasm sqlite. We have a fairly intense pipeline for cleaning web articles (removing ads/styling).

          "description": "I’ve been in the MLOps space for ~10 years, and data is still the hardest unsolved open problem. Code is versioned using Git, data is stored somewhere else, and context often lives in a 3rd location like Slack or GDocs. This is why we built XetHub, a platform that enables teams to treat data like code, using Git.\nUnlike Git LFS, we don’t just store the files. We use content-defined chunking and Merkle Trees to dedupe against everything in history. This allows small changes in large files to be stored compactly. Read more here: https://xethub.com/assets/docs/how-xet-deduplication-works\nToday, XetHub works for 1 TB repositories, and we plan to scale to 100 TB in the next year. Our implementation is in Rust (client & cache + storage) and our web application is written in Go. XetHub includes a GitHub-like web interface that provides automatic CSV summaries and allows custom visualizations using Vega. Even at 1 TB, we know downloading an entire repository is painful, so we built git-xet mount - which, in seconds, provides a user-mode filesystem view over the repo.\nXetHub is available today (Linux & Mac today, Windows coming soon) and we would love your feedback!\nRead more here:\n- https://xetdata.com/blog/2022/10/15/why-xetdata\n- https://xetdata.com/blog/2022/12/13/introducing-xethub\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33969908\nPoints: 212\n# Comments: 130",

I came across two interesting texts:\n What Is An ABI and Why Is It So Complicated\n Flatpak Is Not The Future\n This is a manifold problem that involves many actors and subsystems - compiler settings, target architecture, distro defaults, Unix conventions.\n I am wondering what is your feeling about the future of Linux distros with regard to executable portability. Is Flatpak the lesser evil? Is it a second edition of the LBS agreements? Will containers or virtualisation eventually turn this problem obsolete? Are executable specifications maybe floating up onto some abstraction layer that can eventually turn into an standard?\n    submitted by    /u/Lanky-Apricot7337  \n [link]   [comments]",

Now, one of my few complaints is that the default software center, Pop Shop, is quite buggy and freezes almost every time I try to update my system or install an application. This I found funny given that that's the main purpose of the app, but anyways, this got me looking for its replacement.

I wrote the title because I work at a third party computer/laptop store and the owner told me that a long time ago he had dealt in Linux laptops ( certified Linux laptops ) and it simply caused him to lose money. Now after pandemic, seeing somewhat rising market share of linux desktop we decided to do an experiment. We installed few Linux distros like Fedora, Ubuntu, Kubuntu, Linux Mint and Manjaro gnome on some old second hand laptops lije thinkpads ( laptops with integrated graphics so no nvidia issues ) and tested them so everything worked properly. Now whenever a customer came to buy those laptops we gave them a brief demo on how to use it like what to expect, how to use, how to install software, how to update and some basic stuff. Now here is what we found out: Return rates on these laptops were insanely high like 6-7 times more than windows laptops with Kubuntu and Linux Mint ones somewhat less than Gnome ones. Thankfully they had no warranty so we basically installed windows 10 and sent them back. Two big reasons we found out for them getting returned back were: Lack of Software and User Experience. There were very few software that they needed and open source alternatives if available were just not up to the mark. Usability was also a big issue and they couldn't do much unless they wanted to learn how to use terminal. Now I know terminal makes everything easy but it is for those who have technical knowledge and know how. For non tech people, using Linux is very hard unless there is someone with them to guide them. That is why most hardware companies simply don't want to spend money on pre-installing Linux because the potential customer base is very low.

The 7900 and 7950 3D SKUs seem to only put the extra cache on one of the two chiplets. This chiplet (the one with more cache) will run slower than the other. This introduces some complexity where the kernel would have two manage scheduling across two different vectors, clock speed and cache miss. I suspect (don’t know really) this will require more work on scheduling. \n There is a lot of discussion about this related to Windows in the AMD subreddit, but I’m curious what the Linux community thinks about this. Do you think this design will cause performance issues on Linux? If extra work is required to change scheduling to support this design, how long would that take post launch (I’m not looking for specifics of course, just trying to understand how things like this have played out in the past)?\n    submitted by    /u/marmotter  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "“Control Groups” (aka cgroups) is a Linux kernel feature that organizes processes into hierarchical groups. Based on those groups we can limit and monitor different types of OS resources. Among those resources are: disk I/O usage , network usage, memory usage, CPU usage and more (https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/cgroups.7.html). cgroups are one of the building blocks used for creating containers (which include other stuff like namespaces, capabilities and overlay filesystems).\n The cgroups functionality has been merged into the Linux kernel since version 2.6.24 (released in January 2008). Overall, cgroups provide the following features: resource limiting (as explained above), prioritization (some process groups can have larger shares of resources), control (freezing group of processes) and accounting (https://docs.kernel.org/admin-guide/cgroup-v1/cgroups.html).\n Moreover, there are two versions of cgroups. cgroups v1 was created by Paul Menage and Rohit Seth. cgroups v2 was redesigned and rewritten by Tejun Heo https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Cgroups . The documentation for cgroups v2 first appeared in the Linux kernel 4.5 release on March 2016 (https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/diff/Documentation/cgroup-v2.txt?id=v4.5&id2=v4.4).\n I will write on the differences between the two versions and how to use them in the upcoming writeups. A nice explanation regarding the concept of cgroups is shown in the image below (https://twitter.com/b0rk/status/1214341831049252870). By the way, since kernel 4.19 OOM killer (https://medium.com/@boutnaru/linux-out-of-memory-killer-oom-killer-bb2523da15fc) is aware of cgroups, which means the OS can kill a cgroup as a single unit.\n ​\n  https://twitter.com/b0rk/status/1214341831049252870/photo/1 \n    submitted by    /u/boutnaru  \n [link]   [comments]",

Personally, I'm really hoping that valve starts trying to get in contact with studios whose anti-cheat doesn't support Linux yet, like the guys who made Genshin Impact.

          "description": "I am often switching between my work computer and my fixed computer and I have to manually switch the screen input each time I do it. Today, I took it upon myself to automate this.\n Each time I am switching between the two computers, I plug a USB hub with the mouse, keyboard and headset to the computer I want to use. So I made a udev rule which detects each time my mouse is plugged in and use ddcutil to switch to the correct screen input. Here is the udev rule (located in `/etc/udev/rules.d/switch-screen-input-on-usb-plug.rules`):\n ACTION==\"add\", ATTRS{idVendor}==\"046d\", ATTRS{idProduct}==\"c051\", RUN+=\"/usr/local/sbin/switch-screen-input-on-usb-plug.sh\" \n And the corresponding script:\n #!/bin/bash FILE=/tmp/last-udev-scree-switch last_run=`stat $FILE -c %Z` min_delay=$(( `date +%s` - 30 )) if [ -z \"$last_run\" ] || [ \"$last_run\" -lt \"$min_delay\" ]; then ddcutil -g AOC setvcp 60 0x0f touch $FILE fi \n At first, I just had the ddcutil command in the udev rule but it was executing multiple times when I plugged the hub in causing the screen to flicker. So I made this wrapper script which contains some code to execute the script at most every 30 seconds.\n The vendor and product ID of the USB device can be found using lsusb -v and the capability name and values using ddcutil capabilities. The -g switch for ddcutil selects the screen I am interested in, it is the only one made by the manufacturer AOC.\n I was quite amazed that I was able to do this kind of automation with just a few lines of code. Linux is amazing for this kind of tinkering! I hope this post helps someone who wants to do something similar.\n EDIT: format.\n    submitted by    /u/MortimerErnest  \n [link]   [comments]",

But I working with embedded linux systems I have seen much faster boot-time on weaker hardware.\n On a X1 Carbon with i5-8350U with encrypted root-fs on an NVMe flash systemd-analyze gives me:\n Startup finished in 7.492s (firmware) + 1.971s (loader) + 15.012s (kernel) + 8.475s (userspace) = 32.951s\n I am curious about your boot-times to see if mine are okayish or if I have lots of room to optimize.\n Edit: u/DeedTheInky had a good hint. The password entry time seems to count towards the kernel time for LUKS encrypted volumes. As quick check I waited some seconds and the time reported for the kernel went up to 21s \n    submitted by    /u/xucrodeberco  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Desktop Linux is a very heterogenous environment, with many desktop environments and platforms involved that solve similar problems often in different ways. For that reason, we have the freedesktop/XDG standards these days, that offer a lot of ways for applications to integrate into desktop environments in a platform-agnostic way. If there is no standardised way to do something, you will always have to deal with inconsistencies in applications (like setting the cursor theme and size, which there is to this day no standardised way for). \n Some things however work surprisingly consistent among desktop Linux applications since far longer than freedesktop exists. Among these are shortcuts for copying, cutting and pasting, handling of dead keys and compose keys and other things.\n I wonder: Are these specified anywhere? Is there some sort of official agreement to use e. g. ctrl + c for copying, and not cmd + c for example, or did application authors just happen to stick to the X window system conventions here? What if we need a new application wide shortcut standard that the X window system didn't provide (e. g. for opening an emoji selection popover, or we want applications to implement a touch gesture in a consistent way)?

I had a hard time get it to run on my old hardware (i7 4790k). I had to hack into the bios and flash it afterwards for getting the rebar feature, which the gpu needs. Without, I was only able to allocate 256mb vram.\n So far it runs well. Performance in CSGO is great and a lot of other games run fine as well. Games which use the unreal engine have a hard time to run. I do not really know why. I tested them with different proton versions as well as proton ge. Without -dx12 the games do not start at all when using proton and are crashing my pc when I use proton ge. With -dx12 they do not crash. In the next days I will test with Manjaro unstable and the new Kernel 6.2 rc2. Maybe I will try to compile Mesa.

          "description": "Do you work with ebpf programming and wish for a more lightweight development environment? Check ebas, the ebpf assembler I crafted during the Xmas holidays! \n ebas is a compact, user-friendly program that allows developers to write ebpf programs that generate binaries directly loaded by libbpf. Here's an example of code attached at the entry point of the __x64_sys_nanosleep function written in ebas: \n .section \"fentry/__x64_sys_nanosleep\" .function nanosleep_fentry call.helper 14 rsh.64 r0, 32 ld.dw r1, @pid // immediate value (addr) ld.w r1, r1 // Load 32-bits from memory lsh.64 r1, 32 // expand to 64-bites arsh.64 r1, 32 jne r0, r1, @LBB0_2 ld.dw r1, @fentry_cnt // immediate value (addr) ld.w r2, r1 // Load 32-bits from memory add r2, 1 st.w r1, r2 // Store 32-bits to memory LBB0_2: mov r0, 0 exit .bss .data pid dw 0 .data fentry_cnt dw 0 \n This example illustrates how to craft an ebpf program using ebas. Create ebpf programs with ease and generate binaries quickly.\n Check out the repository on GitHub! https://github.com/ThinkerYzu/ebas\n    submitted by    /u/thinkeryzu  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "A few years ago I put together a Distro Ranking based on the number of Reddit members for the distro's group. This is an update of that ranking.\n Most people new to Linux rely on DistroWatch (DW) for rankings. The DW rankings are based on page views of each of the distros followed by DW. Most people don't believe that the DW rankings accurately reflect the true popularity of the listed distros. For example, in November 2022, DW listed Arch as the 58th most popular distro, behind distros such as Voyager Linux, MakuluLinux, EuroLinux, and others you may not have heard of.\n As an alternative, this project ranks the distros based on the number of members of their Reddit, group. Though it certainly is not perfect, it produces results that appear to better reflect the true popularity of the distros. Based of this methodology, Arch ranked ﻿#2﻿ behind Ubuntu. Looking at the top 10, everything appears reasonable.\n Here is the Google Sheet with the rankings:\n https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ng-UeqrdBbf-LilUu0fXubglXfG3gM5YdUrl6jczr68/edit#gid=973687756\n Some distros I was unable to find a Reddit group, it you are aware of one that I missed please send me a link to it and I will use it going forward. Also I may have picked up an incorrect group for some of the other distros. This is more likely to occur with less popular distros. Again, let me know if you notice a situation like this.\n Enjoy, and let me know what you think in the comments!\n    submitted by    /u/dividends4life  \n [link]   [comments]",

But occasionally something weird will come up that the OS administrator (me) needs to search for possible fixes. \n The problem was with applications installed as SNAP packages. They have been an issue since at least 2017 where these programs can't see some common system elements like attached printers. \n I have searched for a fix off and on for years, often just uninstalling a snap app and reinstalling it in a standard \"all-access way\". This method is no longer an option for certain apps. There were suggestions to use a lot of back door terminal commands I could have tried, but I kept looking for something more elegant. After all, it is 2023!\n Well, I found it in a post by Tommy Trussell on AskUbuntu.\n [ I was able to successfully activate printing using this procedure:\n Open the Ubuntu Software Center application. Search for Firefox and choose it (note it says \"Installed\" next to it). Click the Permissions button. Confirm that its printing permission is set to \":cups-control\". \n On my system, printing had been set to \"(disconnected).\" After I changed it to \":cups-control\" my printers were visible in the Print dialog in Firefox. ]\n    submitted by    /u/jlotz51  \n [link]   [comments]",

I was fed up with the performance and memory overhead of using virtual machines, and I had no other options for running distros on an Unraid host. The idea was to create a tiny container that would remount / within its assigned cgroup to a Docker volume or bind mount to a directory somewhere on the host, keeping a fully non-volatile filesystem that could be treated like a lightweight virtual machine. \n At the time, I managed to make it work with a privileged container as a headless server that could be SSHed into. More recently, I've actually been able to turn it into a full headless server with a GPU-accelerated desktop environment (using X and an Nvidia card). Would anybody else here be interested in learning how to do it, or have some tips and feedback to help improve the experience (or figure out how to do it without a privileged container)?\n Some notable things that were actually possible with this absurd setup:\n  \nGot Arch running, bootstrapped from their Docker image.\n Successfully used systemd as an init daemon inside a container.\n Used sunshine (Nvidia GameStream server) instead of VNC.\n KDE Plasma desktop environment.\n Steam, with working Remote Play and Proton (including 3D games).\n  \n   submitted by    /u/eth-p  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Myself and a couple others in have stumbled onto some new linux malware in the wild. The tl;dr is that a botnet attempts to gain access via ssh, primarily targeting users named \"steam,\" \"steamcmd,\" \"steamserver,\" \"valheim,\" and potentially a few other games. Checking ssh logs on my server, I see intrusion attempts going back to 2022-12-16, and continuing to this day. When I checked my logs, we saw intrusion attempts going back to 2022-12-10, and successful logins going back to 2022-12-11 (yeah... it took them one day to get in.) once they get in, the botnet drops a malware payload in \n ~/.configrc4 \n primarily consisting of a bitcoin miner. We noticed this because we saw the process \n kswapd0 \n maxing out 12 cpu cores, even when swap was inactive. Some investigation revealed that this instance of kswapd0 was not actually a kernel process owned by root as you'd normally expect, but it was instead a binary in a hidden directory being run as the steam user. \n lsof \n revealed that the steam user was also actively running fake binaries named \n tor \n and \n rsync \n also contained within \n ~/.configrc4 \n I'm currently waiting for tthe server to make a transfer of those files so that I can take a closer look at them (or at the very least, see what virustotal makes of them), but in the meantime i've done a simple DDG search and got a grand total of five results. Four of which were random chinese websites, and the last one was this: https://www.reddit.com/r/valheim/comments/zltnqb/dedicated_server_hacked_for_bitcoin_mining/ Some tips to protect yourself: 1. Disable password auth in sshd, use ed25519 keys instead 2. For any non-human accounts, set their shell to nologin 3. Install and configure Fail2Ban 4.

That's why I've decided to create a YouTube channel where I can share my ideas, inspirations, and even some tutorials related to home labs. I have also mentioned jellyfin as my most prized self hosted app,\n I've already created a couple of videos that I think you'll find interesting, and I'm always open to constructive criticism and new ideas.

          "description": "Hi everyone,\n After posting this post yesterday, I looked into cheap laptops and Chromebooks. I noticed that Amazon seemed to tell refurbished Thinkpads, like this T470, which is about twice the price of a Raspberry Pi, yet it is a laptop.\n Many of you may have read this post on /r/ProgrammerHumor, which I think is quite interesting. So I was wondering that can I use such Thinkpad as a dev environment and a mini server (for practice)? How much workload (like number of visitors at the same time) can it handle?\n Thank you for your time.\n Edit: This is another relevant and interesting piece: https://interconnected.org/home/2022/10/10/servers\n    submitted by    /u/hedgehog0  \n [link]   [comments]",

It is the user-mode part which belongs to the task/process. For more information about memory management I suggest reading https://medium.com/@boutnaru/linux-memory-management-part-1-introduction-896f376d3713. \n By the way, until kernel version 2.6.23 the struct was defined under “/include/linux/sched.h” (https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v2.6.23/source/include/linux/sched.h#L369), since “2.6.24” it is located under “/include/linux/mm_types.h” (https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v2.6.24/source/include/linux/mm_types.h#L156). \n Also, there is a pointer from the process’ “task_struct” (…",

          "description": "I picked out the laptop to be compatible (Lenovo ThinkBook on a black friday sale for a dang good price). Her now-previous laptop was a Dell that cost about $400 in 2010, I think. It was chugging (3gb RAM, middle-of-the-road Core2Duo processor) and either needed to be upgraded significantly (HDD, processor, memory) or replaced. Pricing out the parts and labor for upgrading and factoring in the wear and tear on the motherboard and other components (chassis has been dropped a few times...)...that computer had a great run and it makes no sense to upgrade it. Literally has duck tape on it. Lubuntu kept it alive for quite some time past its planned obsolescence date (POD?).\n She downloaded the .iso, installed it onto a usb drive, then activated the bios boot menu, booted the live usb, erased that weird mess that still comes pre-installed on far too many computers, installed the OS, rebooted, ran updates, installed their backports PPA.\n Yes I was on the phone with her for most of it. But I think it was an actual empowering experience for her, demystified a lot of the process.\n I'm so glad that at least some hardware manufacturers are making Linux compatibility a priority. Things have come a long way since 2010.\n This week she'll be making a final backup of her old computer, trying to install a few pieces of extra software on her own, and then I'll help her with any extra system configuration and printer installation, restoring the backup to her new computer, etc.\n I'm kinda proud of her.\n    submitted by    /u/ayoungethan  \n [link]   [comments]",

This protocol is used by IPv6 based routers in order to discover multicast listeners on the local network and identify which multicast addresses are of interest to those listeners.

I really don't want to use anything associated with microsoft when I can help it, so I'd rather not use VS Codium. Kate and Sublime Text are the closest so far. They allow me to save sessions, and they allow me to open a folder on the left hand side, so that I can quickly click around this directory to open these files I'm constantly editing small lines in. Sublime supports multi cursor, Kate does not. I'm running Arch Linux. I understand vim is very powerful if I learn all it's features, but for the way I'm editing the text files, I don't think a terminal solution is right here.\n EDIT: I'm going with pulsar, a fork of ATOM, and am very thankful for that find!\n    submitted by    /u/ankelbiter12  \n [link]   [comments]",

The results were, obviously, that Snaps were much worse behaving, but my study received quite some criticism (valid, IMO), as my approach was to install alphabetically from A to whatever letter I needed to reach the 400 snaps (so, as there was no careful selection, I …",

I should say, Linus only accepts open source drivers into the Linux kernel, but the point is that proprietary drivers are still getting used.\n For those who don't know why exactly that's a big deal, I've asked and have been told that once a driver is loaded into the kernel, that's it. It has full limitless control over the system. It could even infect the UEFI and make infections persist across a total reformat and reinstall. \n Because of all this, proprietary drivers are a MASSIVE FUCKING security hole that really does need to be closed as fast as possible. Of course, you could always run Linux with only open source drivers, but this is not always realistic. Android phones, just for starters, are loaded down with tons of proprietary drivers with no way to not use them without bricking the phone. And even if open soruce drivers are used, if malware ever compromises them, then that malware also has total control anyway.\n I understand that in the past, microkernels had performance issues compared to monolithic kernels, but I've also heard that recently, as long as the microkernel is correctly designed, this is no longer an issue. So, can we start giving this endeavor priority?\n    submitted by    /u/Arnoxthe1  \n [link]   [comments]",

And if your extension isn't signed, your only have four options: - Install it as a temporary extension which will be removed when Firefox is closed. - Install a Nightly (or Developer Edition, which is just a uniquely-named beta release) version of Firefox which is more likely to have bugs. - Install a weird unbranded version of Firefox that doesn't auto-update and definitely won't integrate with your package manager. (Yes, an HN comment was the most recent source I could find, these builds are really poorly documented.) - Remove Firefox's signature check yourself.\n In comparison, Chrome will bug you about it, but won't stop you from installing extension from outside the Chrome Web Store. (And for that matter, if you're using a beta version of Firefox which allows unsigned extensions, it will also warn you about it.)\n I don't know about anyone else here, but one of the main reasons I use Linux is to be in control of my computer. So I find it really annoying that Mozilla has decided that they know what's best for me and won't let me install my own extensions on my own computer (like iOS) without jumping through some really annoying hoops (also like iOS).\n (And let's not even talk about how Mozilla locked the Android version of Firefox to an arbitrary list of 18 extensions.)\n I would switch to Chrome if not for the fact that Google is even worse in almost every other aspect (Manifest v3 fiasco anyone?).\n While this doesn't impact me in any practical way because all the extensions I use are on Mozilla's store, I still find it infuriating that Mozilla controls what I can and can't install on my own web browser.

But currently, I mean more than that.\n The reason behind this is that this protocol has gone beyond telemetry transport. The major focus of MQTT is now the entire IoT space. \n Pub/Sub\n Classic Client-Server pattern requires the client and server to know each other. This is an example of a strongly coupled system. The issue that is, the server itself needs to maintain a registry of clients, making it complex, error-prone, and somehow a single point of failure. \n MQTT uses a Pub/Sub pattern which decouples this system. \n The high-level architecture is consisting of three components: publisher - broker - subscriber.

          "description": "As stated in my previous writeup about processes (https://medium.com/@boutnaru/linux-processes-part-1-introduction-283f5b5b4197) every operating system has a data structure that represents a “process object” (generally called PCB - Process Control Block). By the way, “task_strcut” is the PCB in Linux (it is also the TCB, meaning the Thread Control Block). As an example, a diagram that shows two processes opening the same file and the relationship between the two different “task_struct” structures is shown below. \n Overall, we can say that “task_struct” holds the data an operating system needs about a specific process. Among those data elements are: credentials ,priority, PID (process ID), PPID (parent process ID), list of open resources, memory space range information, namespace information (https://medium.com/system-weakness/linux-namespaces-part-1-dcee9c40fb68), kprobes instances (https://medium.com/@boutnaru/linux-instrumentation-part-2-kprobes-b089092c4cff) and more. \n Moreover, If you want to go over all of data elements I suggest going through the definition of “task_struct” as part of the Linux source code - https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v6.2-rc1/source/include/linux/sched.h#L737. Also, fun fact is that in kernel 6.2-rc1 “task_strcut” is referenced in 1398 files (https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v6.2-rc1/A/ident/task_struct). \n Lastly, familiarity with “task_struct” can help a lot with tracing and debugging tasks as shown in the online book “Dynamic Tracing with DTrace & SystemTap” (https://myaut.github.io/dtrace-stap-book/kernel/proc.html). Also, it is very handy when working with bpftrace. For example sudo bpftrace -e ‘kfunc:hrtimer_wakeup { printf(“%s:%d\\n”,curtask->comm,curtask->pid); }’, which prints the pid and the process name of all processes calling the kernel function hrtimer_wakeup (https://medium.com/@boutnaru/the-linux-process-journey-pid-0-swapper-7868d1131316). \n ​\n https://myaut.github.io/dtrace-stap-book/kernel/proc.html\n    submitted by    /u/boutnaru  \n [link]   [comments]",

I was still logged in, so I had two options - either spend hours backing up all my data and doing a fresh install, or try to repair the drive. It was risky, but I decided to use testdisk on a live USB to try and recover the lost partition. Even if it failed, I would be able to use the same tool to recover my data anyway.\n And thankfully, it worked. I had a bit of trouble actually installing testdisk on the live drive (had to add 'universe' to my sources) but in the end the risk was worth it.\n ​\n This is a reminder to ALWAYS CHECK WHAT DEVICE YOU HAVE SELECTED WHEN USING GPARTED\n    submitted by    /u/mighty_spaceman  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Not sure how many of your are in the market for a Linux laptop, but I thought I would share my own experience with the HP Dev One.\n I decided to pull the trigger on it a couple weeks ago when it was $200 off. It actually arrived very quickly (in 2 days). Overall I think it's a really fantastic laptop, excellent build quality and (obviously) excellent Linux compatibility. I really love the screen (it's only 1080p, but it's beautiful, excellent vibrancy and blacks), the Thinkpad like \"nipple\", and the keyboard. The CPU is a beast, having 8 cores/16 threads on a laptop is amazing for software development work.\n You can even update the BIOS via fwupdmgr which is brilliant! I didn't need to install anything special, I just ran fwupdmgr get-updates and then fwupdmgr update. After that I rebooted and the BIOS update started.\n The only downside that I see is that it only comes with 16GB of RAM which is a real bummer. The RAM is at least it is user upgradable (unlike other laptops where the RAM is soldered on). For about $900 USD (after the discount), it's still an absolute steal.\n Check out the specs here: https://hpdevone.com/. The discount code is in the banner at the top!\n If anyone is interested in running other distros, I ended up installing Arch Linux on it, everything is working great and I didn't have to install any additional drivers. There is an AUR package: https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/hp-vendor-dkms-git that apparently exposes Fan Speed and additional battery details, but I haven't installed it yet.\n Pop_OS is great, but I can't give up Arch :)\n I'm really happy that more companies are supporting Linux on their hardware, so I'm inclined to support them when they put out a good product!\n    submitted by    /u/rstrube  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "In the days of X11, we had separate software to do different things: Xorg was one software, the windows manager was another one, and even the window decorator was often a separate stuff. If you wanted, you could even have a separate compositing manager instead of having a windows manager that also did compositing (an example is picom). This compartmentalization was standardized and, although it apparently caused some complications, it had the undoubted advantage of being good for stability: in the event of a crash of the windows manager, for instance, one only had to restart it and no work was lost. To be on the safe side, one could have two windows managers installed and if a bug did not allow restarting the default one, the user could start the second one.\n With Wayland, things have completely changed and the window manager / compositor is also the display server. This means that a crash of the wm/compositor/display server kills all open graphics software.\n This is especially risky because on modern desktops windows managers are complex software, which handle graphic effects, and it takes very little to crash them. For instance on KDE, Kwin is pluggable with effects and scripts. On Gnome, even the Gnome Shell itself is a Mutter plugin. So, a bug in a Gnome shell extension can kill the entire session.\n Such a design in which the stability of the entire graphical system depends on a single piece of software, and its plugins, does not make sense.\n    submitted by    /u/guiodic76  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I know this is two questions in one, but I think the two are related. I'm just not sure how. I've been using Linux for a couple decades. While I've done a lot with configuration files, this either covers something at a deeper level than I've used or it's just new material for me.\n I've gone through the man page and a few other pages on udevadm and udev rules and I'm still not clear what the KERNEL and KERNELS keywords are specifying when I do an attribute-walk or when used in udev rules files. What I'm trying to learn now is how to specify, in udev rules, how to point to whatever device is plugged into a particular USB port. It looks to me like the KERNEL keyword is part of thi. When I look at the attributes for one USB camera, I get the following attributes under KERNEL or KERNELS: \n KERNEL==\"ttyACM1\"\n KERNELS==\"1-1.1:1.0\"\n KERNELS==\"1-1.1\"\n KERNELS==\"1-1\"\n KERNELS==\"usb1\"\n KERNELS==\"0000:01:00.0\"\n KERNELS==\"0000:00:00.0\"\n KERNELS==\"pci0000:00\"\n KERNELS==\"fd500000.pcie\"\n KERNELS==\"scb\"\n KERNELS==\"platform\"\n I've seen examples, including some questions and answers on Stack Exchange that seem to use something like KERNELS==\"1-1.1:1.0\" to specify the physical port, but I'm not sure just what to search for to get a breakdown on what each number means. I've done a number of searches on this, but can't fill in the gaps in my knowledge on it. I do see the KERNELS==\"usb1\" attribute, but this is not what I've seen any examples use to specify a particular physical USB port.\n How do I specify to use a device at a specific physical USB port and, along with that, I'd like to know just what the other attributes with the various numbers mean.\n    submitted by    /u/ImaginaryTango  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hi, new here. As we all know, battery life on Linux is often worse than windows out of the box (which is an issue that deserves its own post, so I won't rant on it here.) But nobody seems to be talking about the power draw disparity on desktop computers. Between the latest CPU/GPU power requirements and the cost of electricity getting to the point where people are starting to take their power bills into account for the first time, this concern is fresh in my mind. Can anyone confirm whether or not a desktop PC uses more power on Linux than Windows? Like, if you're gaming, does it use more power, or is it only using more power when running at idle or lighter tasks? I'd do it myself but I don't have a desktop. This seems like a pretty important topic nobody is talking about. I understand this is sort of a big ask, especially if you don't dual boot. But I feel like this is really important question that needs an answer.\n Edit: I'd like to thank everyone for responding, especially the guy who linked some previously done tests that showed its not even worth worrying about. They called it unsatisfying, but I see that result as quite satisfying. In the age of mobile computing, it's pathetic that Linux uses more power than Windows on a laptop, glad to see that on desktop it's not as consistent of a problem.\n    submitted by    /u/Indolent_Bard  \n [link]   [comments]",

With seccomp a process can perform a one-way transition to a “secure mode”, in that mode the process can just run the following syscall: read, write, sigreturn and exit. It was merged into the Linux kernel in version 2.6.12 (released in March 2005). \n We can configure seccomp by the libseccomp (https://github.com/seccomp/libseccomp), the prctl(https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/prctl.2.html) system call and/or the seccomp syscall (https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/seccomp.2.html) and/or other CLI tools (like https://github.com/david942j/seccomp-tools) . \n Due to its capabilities seccomp is commonly used in sandboxe…",

          "description": "Hey all,\n Last months I've been working on a graphing and data manipulation tool (just a hobby, won't be big and professional like Origin Labs 😉). Graphs is a libadwaita application, and is developed with the GNOME environment in mind, but it should work on any other arbitrary DE as well.\n I've mainly been working on this application because I'm a PhD student in physics, and I've feel like an application like this has been lacking. Either it's convoluted and non-intuitive like SciDaVis or Origin, or you're left to using Python scripting with Matplotlib.\n The goal of Graphs is to be able to easily import a data file, plot it how you want to, and to do simple operations on it. There's a number of preset operations to use, as well as a custom transformation button, which allows for arbitrary transformations using numpy notation. If I want to take the sine of the X axis, I can just easily till it to apply X = sin(X) on the X coordinates. I can also use the coordinates of the other axis, so Y = Y/X divides each Y value by the corresponding X value in the data file.\n Another neat feature I'd want to highlight is the ability to insert a new data set from an equation with a click from the button. Here too Numpy notation is used (with the exception that is does accept ^ as power operator as well as **, since I felt just ** as power operator is too unintuitive. This is also the case for the transformation button). The resulting data set gets treated identical to regular data sets and can be saved as text file as well.\n I've released Graphs on Flathub last week, and by now I've implemented most of the core functionality. There's still some interesting features planned, and I'm very open to feedback of any kind.\n Hopefully some of you find it useful. Here's a link to the Flathub page if anyone is interested: link.\n    submitted by    /u/DelusionalSocialist  \n [link]   [comments]",

In order to remove a handler we call “free_irq”. Fun fact, “request_irq” is referenced in 1280 files in the source code of the Linux kernel (version 6.1). \n Overall, we can think about two major use cases when we are handling interrupts. First, interrupts that are designed to execute quickly. Second, interrupts which have to do several operations to complete (meaning they won’t execute quickly).\n Due…",

Though, I really like ideas behind Rust language, I think it introduces great risks to Linux future: Rust's learning curve is very steep, so in a few years we might end up with more and more developers deciding to go away from Linux kernel to some new fancy Google kernel. Nowadays Linux is pretty simple, written mostly in C and ASM, and it is REALLY enjoyable to use. Since I am on my own not a professional Linux kernel dev, I won't bother with learning Rust. And if there is Rust code in my module of interest, I will just take something else (*BSD or some RTOS) to use in my project.

          "description": "I shared a project I've been working on periodically on here a few months back, hflow. It's a http debugging proxy, written in Go.\n At the time it only allowed you to view and filter http traffic. Despite this, a number of people used it, starred it and forked it; so I thought I'd share the updates that I've recently released with you. Especially as some were explicitly asked for on this sub, and similarly themed ones.\n hflow now supports the following features:\n  \nTraffic Capture: Capture all traffic or filter by request url and/or response status\n Edit & Continue: Break on requests and/or responses that match a specified url pattern and edit them before they are forwarded and/or returned\n Request Re-routing: Route requests destined for one host to another, such as a local or test instance\n TLS Support: Decrypt both HTTP and HTTPS traffic. Add HFLOW's root CA certificate into your client's certificate store for seamless HTTPS traffic interception\n Response Decoding: Automatically decodes gzip and brotli encoded responses\n Flexible CLI: Write captured traffic to stdout or to a named file, optionally omit binary data or truncate large payloads\n Comprehensive Documentation: View a 'quick start' guide and detailed information on installation and advance usage in the README\n  \nI genuinely don't think there's anything like it currently available on Linux or macOS, for free, that is as solid, and now fully featured, as hflow is. It's been a lot of enjoyable, but sometimes hard, work and, frankly, I'm proud of it!\n There's lots more information on the README and the source code is available here\n There's binaries available for various platforms here\n I hope some of you find it as useful as I do :)\n    submitted by    /u/comrade-quinn  \n [link]   [comments]",

It directs data from one network node to the next based on short path labels rather than long network addresses, avoiding complex lookups in a routing table. It is basically switching packets. Thus, we can think about it as a protocol that is between the data link layer (layer 2) and the network layer (layer 3), because of that it is commonly thought as a layer 2.5 protocol.\n The name of the protocol is composed of “Multi Protocol” because it can encapsulate packets from various protocols. Also, “Label Switching” due to the fact labels are used for switching.

          "description": "I've administered Linux both professionally and personally in my home. I enjoy trying to find FOSS options esp. for home use. I like the implication of what FOSS brings to the table and supporting those efforts. However even after 13-14 years of using Linux I still find installs outside of the standard package managers to be nearly always infuriating. I truly don't understand why things have to be so complex and why prebuilt packages can't be the norm. i.e., windows exe or msi. Why is the reliance on the consumer of the application to sift through the mountains of dependencies and their respective installs and out of date guides and install switches that nobody except for the maintainers of those tools seems to know about. \n For an example: I've recently been working on my home automation …",

          "description": "The easy answer to get Linux working fast on an old machine, with the benefit of a PCIE NVME SSD, is to create two small partitions on a BIOS-recognised drive to boot from. (these sizes could be smaller) 1GB for efi and 2GB for /boot. If you then create root / and /home on your SSD it will boot from the recognised drive and benefit from the SSD, but don't forget to point the bootloader at the BIOS-recognised drive during installation. This is the way my 11 year old i5 desktop with a PCIE slot-mounted SSD runs Kubuntu ...and it runs it really well. I don't know how the following works, but it even boots (much) faster, despite the boot stuff being on the old drive.\n    submitted by    /u/c_malc  \n [link]   [comments]",

Now we are going to deep dive into the network namespaces.\n First, in order for the kernel to support network namespaces we need to compile the kernel with “CONFIG_NET_NS” enabled. Overall, network namespaces can separate/isolate/segregate between the different system resources which are associated with networking under Linux. Among those resources are: firewall rules, routing tables (IP), IPv4 and IPv6 protocol stacks, sockets, different directories related to the networking subsystem (like: “/proc/[PID]/net”, “/proc/sys/net”, “/sys/class/net” and more), etc (https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/network_namespaces.7.html).\n By the way, unix domain sockets are also isolated using network namespaces (“man 7 unix”). It is important to understand that a physical network device can exist in one network namespace at a time (singleton). In case the last process in a network namespace returns/exits, Linux frees the namespace which moves the physical network device to the initial network namespace.\n Moreover, in case we want to create a bridge to a network device which is part of a different namespace we can use a virtual network device. It can create tunnels between network namespaces (https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man4/veth.4.html). \n Lastly, you can see an example of creating a network namespace in the screenshot below. As you can see an iptables rule is created but it is not relevant to the newly created network namespace. \n ​\n https://preview.redd.it/cnlwgvnint5a1.png?width=494&format=png&auto=webp&s=7bc200d93a7c965ab981ea70fb8f45bedb0ac6af\n    submitted by    /u/boutnaru  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I just finished writing an essay for University and went to save it, I selected my directory and went to type the file name I wanted, unfortunately the default behaviour for nautilus (gnome-files) is to use your input for search over renaming the file you're about to save. This isn't bad, but combine that with nautilus's search crashing 50% of the time I use it, both nautilus and LibreOffice crashed loosing my work (and LO recovery did not work). \n Luckily it was less that 1000 words so I'll be able to rewrite it pretty quickly, but it got me thinking about the little things that Gnome does that annoy me, and in my frustrations with having to rewrite the essay I thought I'd share some paper cuts I get from Gnome:\n  \nNautilus search crashes and/or 'lags' making itself unusable.\n \nIn the new drop down, the bluetooth toggle doesn't give you an option to access the full settings page.\n Again in the drop down, my phone's internet is now a permanent option. I've only connected my phone to my PC once.\n When ejecting a USB the 'Device should not be unplugged.' message won't go away.\n When copying to a USB that uses NTFS, exFAT (and others) the progress in nautilus will be for your RAM buffer not the time it takes to copy it to the USB.\n In display setting, screens of the same resolution are shown to be the same size.\n I know this is a personal preference, but especially with multiple monitors workspaces work so much better vertically.\n  \n   submitted by    /u/Devorlon  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "2012 年至今，我花了大量时间学习时间管理方法，看完了领域内几乎所有书籍，实践了各种方法，却还是无法管好自己，知行分离成为了长期困扰我的问题。如何成为一个即知即行的人？我把探索的触角进一步伸向了心理学、认知科学、社会学等领域。跟随阳志平老师学习的经历启发了我，我看清了那些时间管理方法对我不起作用的原因，也找到了更有效的自我管理之道 —— 心流管理。\n我发现很多介绍时间管理的书籍，没有充分考虑「人」这个关键因素。所以，本篇作为《心流管理》的第一篇，会先从人格特质的角度，解读主流时间管理方法适合的人群，帮助大家选择更适合自己的工具。\n时间管理难在哪里\n总的来说，时间管理之难，在于两点：\n因为我们是理性的人，我们会不自觉地计算成本和收益是否平衡。\n因为我们不是理性的人，方法和个性之间的冲突，造成了知易行难这个问题。\n为了帮助大家了解适合自己的时间管理方法，我把常见的时间管理方法分为 3 大派别：时间记录派、GTD / 清单派、目标管理派。在反复尝试过这些方法后，我对它们的优缺点和适用范围都有所了解，在此总结了一个简单的表格，供你参考：\n \n                时间记录派\n                GTD/清单派\n                考核派\n            \n流行程度\n                低\n                中高\n                中\n            \n上手难度\n                低\n                中\n                中\n            \n时间成本\n                较高\n                中\n                低\n            \n每一个方法都有其精妙之处，也都有其适用性。根据不同的实际情况和人格特质，选到最适合的方法才能帮我们更好地提高效率。接下来，我将对这些派别的适用性进行分析，以及如何进行针对性的调整，希望这篇文章能够引领你完成一次有益的探讨。\n[......]\n查看全文\n本文为付费栏目文章，出自《心流管理魔方》，订阅后可阅读全文。",

Reischauer）正准备离开美国大使馆，前往参加韩国前总理金钟泌举办的午餐会。从1960年被肯尼迪政府任命为驻日大使，他便成为东京外交官圈中的中心人物。日本研究与东亚研究的学术背景，让他在当地如鱼得水，不仅与日本政商学各界频繁互动，也能与包括韩国在内的其他东亚国家地区的政要保持密切沟通。\n与之前历任驻日大使不同，这位来自哈佛大学的赖肖尔是第一位精通日本文化、能用流利日语进行交流的美国驻日大使。其实，赖肖尔本人就是1910年在日本东京出生的，当时他的父亲正在日本传教。在回美国上大学前，他一直在日本的美国侨民学校就读，浸润在日本社会文化之中。用他在回忆录《我的两个祖国》中的话来说就是“从呱呱坠地的那一刻起，我就置身于日本的环境之中，日本的景色、日本的声音、日本的气息都是我自小所熟悉的”。这段独特的成长经历，使其早早就将日本及东亚研究作为毕生志业，并成为哈佛大学东亚研究的奠基者之一。\n24日这一天，赖肖尔刚走出大厅玄关，就瞥见不远处有一位穿着雨衣、行迹可疑的日本青年。\n“这人要上哪里去？”\n赖肖尔刚回头向工作人员询问，这位青年竟握着一把厨房用的菜刀冲向了美国大使。菜刀扎进了赖肖尔的右侧大腿，顿时血流如注，伤口长达五十厘米，从腰部一直延伸至膝部。所幸行凶者立刻就被负责大使馆警卫的陆战队员及其他工作人员制服，而赖肖尔也被第一时间送往虎之门医院抢救。\n对当时的日本来说，《美日安保条约》引发的安保斗争风波尚未消散，驻日美军、核武器部署等美日间的敏感议题仍时不时会引爆日本国内的社会舆论，甚至导致激烈的社会抗争运动。而即将于1964年10月举行的东京奥运会在一定程度上淡化或掩盖了日本社会对上述敏感议…",

Bulliet）却在《骆驼与轮子》一书里告诉读者，在中世纪的中东与北非地区，曾经出现过一场技术“倒退”，当地几乎完全废弃了作为交通工具的（车）轮，取而代之的则是一种纯粹的畜力——骆驼。\n说起来，这倒也不是布利特在当下这个互联网时代故作惊人之语以吸引眼球。《骆驼与轮子》中译本称得上是一本“迟来”的新著。此书的英文原版面世于半个世纪之前，以至于读者可以毫不费力地在书中发现早已“过时”的专有名词——比如将1977年成立的吉布提共和国继续称为“法属阿法尔与伊萨领地”，而1993年已经成为独立国家的厄立特里亚在《骆驼与轮子》里也仍旧是“埃塞俄比亚属”。但这并不意味着布利特在书中的论点过时了。这方面的一个例证就是，英国学者布莱恩·费根（Brian Fagan）在《亲密关系：动物如何塑造人类历史》（浙江大学出版社2019年12月版）里就引述了布利特的相关看法，足见此本《骆驼与轮子》虽然已经比许多读者的年纪还大，但阅读价值至今仍在。\n作为布利特笔下的主角，“骆驼”自然是一种人们很熟悉的家畜。身体强健的骆驼，可负重近三百公斤，中等者亦可负重一百四十公斤有余。而且，骆驼足蹄特殊，适于行走各种地形，又极其耐渴，在夏季可三至七日不饮水，在冬季，若草料含有水分，甚至可以完全不饮水，因此也有个“沙漠之舟”的雅号。需要说明的是，当今世界上其实存在三种骆驼：单峰…",

          "description": "去年，伦敦宫廷剧院卷入了一场反犹主义风波。当时他们的最新剧目，艾尔·史密斯创作的《稀土气概》，描绘一个身为一家电动汽车公司首席执行官的亿万富翁，擅长躲在暗处操纵傀儡，并将这个角色取名为赫谢尔·芬克（Hershel Fink）。该剧并未探讨芬克的背景，它与犹太人或犹太性毫无关系，史密斯只是决定给剧中的财阀恶势力起一个明显听起来像犹太人的名字。\n\n伦敦宫廷剧院\n\n在公众的强烈抗议下，这个名字被匆匆改成了亨利·芬恩（Henry Finn）——但伤害已无可挽回。剧院发表了一份声明，承认存在“无意识的偏见”，两家支持他们的企业撤回了赞助。经过内部调查，剧院发现“在剧目制作过程中相对后期阶段，曾有人先后两次向导演[哈米什·皮里]提出过对这个名字的担忧”，这类担忧“没有得到适当的解决”。看来皮里要么不理解这个名字的意义，要么无所谓。他此后“衷心道歉”。\n王家宫廷剧院对犹太社群成员的骚扰史由来已久。1987年，由肯·罗奇执导的吉姆·艾伦剧作《毁灭》在遭遇严苛批判后不得不取消首演，该剧指责犹太复国主义者与纳粹相互勾结。（这也是前工党议员肯·利文斯通最喜欢的套路；他和艾伦都深受捏造事实的托派历史学家列尼·布伦纳影响）。这家剧院在2009年上演了卡莱尔·邱吉尔的短剧《七个犹太孩子》，剧中的整个犹太社区似乎与最近以色列在加沙的军事行动有牵连。多位评论家称其为“血腥诽谤”。\n然而，“芬克门”有些不同。它的一部分源自无端的恶意。这与复杂的中东政治和当代犹太复国主义无关，而是将犹太人等同于邪恶势力的古老诽谤。整个事件也恰好撞上了好时机：在工党以及其他地方因为反犹主义而生的乱局持续五年后，伴随着杰里米·科尔宾的发迹与下台，英国犹太人的忍耐已经达到极限。\n王家宫廷剧院听到了这些声音。艺术总监维基·费瑟斯通与犹太演员特蕾西-安·奥伯曼进行了一番漫长讨论，结果是费瑟斯通决定委约制作一部关于反犹主义的纪实剧作。费…",

          "description": "Ultramarine Linux 的新版本来了。Ultramarine Linux 37 带有新的自定义软件仓库、KDE Plasma 特色版等等。\n\r\n\r\n如果你不知道，Ultramarine Linux 是一个基于 Fedora 的发行版，提供了 Budgie、Pantheon、GNOME 等桌面环境。这个发行版通过这些令人赞叹的桌面环境给你提供了最好的 Fedora 体验。\n\r\n最近，这个小项目被 FyraLabs 收购，后者是 PhotonBrowser 和 tauOS 背后的公司。而这使得 Ultramarine 项目有了必要的人力和资金来继续建设他们的发行版。\n\r\n自 Fedora 37 发布以来，该团队一直致力于重建当前版本，这包括采用新的基础设施和 CI/CD 管道迁移。终于，Ultramarine Linux 37 登场了。\n\r\n那么，它有什么新东西呢？\n\r\nUltramarine Linux 37 的新功能\n\r\n自从被 Fyralabs 收购后，该团队升级并迁移到用于自动化 CI/CD 构建的 GitHub Actions。Ultramarine 自己的软件仓库用于分发其精心组织的软件包（例如 Pantheon 桌面），它在这个版本中会发生变化，并转移到 FyraLabs 的基础设施上。\n\r\n因此，如果你正在运行 Ultramarine 36 版本，它可能无法正常工作。你最好重新安装这个版本，因为显然没有从 36 版到 37 版的升级路径。\n\r\n此外，Ultramarine 37 为 Fedora 软件包引入了一个名为 Terra 的滚动仓库，其中包括数百个 Fedora 不提供的应用程序。你可以认为它类似于 RPM Fusion，尽管有所不同。\n\r\n要了解更多，请访问 本页 或从命令行添加以下软件仓库：\n\r\nsudo dnf config-manager --add-repo https://terra.fyralabs.com/terra.repo\r\n\n\r\n事实上，这开启了一种可能性，因为你也可以尝试在 Fedora Linux 中谨慎地使用它。如果上述软件仓库能在普通的 Fedora 安装中开箱即用，那就更棒了。\n\r\n在上述变化的基础上，Ultramarine Linux 37 首次引入了 KDE Plasma 作为官方版本。KDE Plasma 特色版带来了含有 Latte Dock 和 Lightly Qt 主题的 Pop OS 风格外观。\n\r\n\n\r\nUltramarine Linux 37 也放弃了 Cutefish 桌面，因为它目前正处于 混乱的开发状态，没有可见的路线图。这是该团队的一个很好的决定，因为打包一个已经停止的项目是没有意义的。\n\r\nBudgie 桌面旗舰版使用上游的 Fedora 软件包，有更多的默认应用程序。最近，Fedora Linux 删除了对 elementary OS 的 Pantheon 桌面的支持，很遗憾。感谢 Ultramarine Linux 开发者，你仍然可以体验它，因为它已经被转移到新的 Terra 软件仓库中。\n\r\n你应该庆幸，Ultramarine Linux 是唯一一个的基于 Fedora 的支持令人赞叹的 Pantheon 桌面的发行版。\n\r\n最后，Ultramarine Linux 37 的核心基于 Fedora 37，采用 Linux 主线内核 6.0。因此，所有更新的软件包和工具链都在这个版本中。\n\r\n所以，这就是关于这个版本的总结。请继续关注几天后对这个版本的官方点评。如果有兴趣，你可以在这里阅读之前的版本（36）的评论。\n\r\n\r\nUltramarine Linux：带有 Budgie、Cutefish 和 Pantheon 桌面的终极 Fedora 特色版\n\r\n\r\n下载和升级\n\r\n由于没有升级路径，建议你对该版本进行全新安装。你可以在下面下载各个桌面环境的 ISO 文件。\n\r\n\r\n下载 Ultramarine Linux 37\n\r\n\r\n参考自：发布公告。\n\r\n\r\nvia: https://debugpointnews.com/ultramarine-linux-37-release/\n\r\n作者：arindam 选题：lkxed 译者：wxy 校对：wxy\n\r\n本文由 LCTT 原创编译，Linux中国 荣誉推出",

          "description": "C 语言已不再仅仅是一种编程语言\n\r\n有一篇论文说，《C 语言不是一种低级别的编程语言》。它不是说有其他编程语言比 C 语言更低级，C 语言经常被称赞为 “接近于裸金属”，是一种 “可移植的汇编语言”。它曾经是，但自 20 世纪 70 年代以来就不是了；现代计算机的底层计算模型与 C 所代表的模型完全不同，它是为 20 世纪 70 年代的 16 位微型计算机设计的。任何语言开发的程序都必须与操作系统对接，而操作系统几乎都是用 C 语言开发的。换句话说，即使你从来没有写过任何 C 语言的代码，你也必须处理 C 语言的变量，匹配 C 语言的数据结构和布局，用符号链接 C 语言的函数名称。\n\r\n\r\n消息来源：The Register\n\r\n\r\n\r\n老王点评：一种有趣的思考，或许是应该思考抛弃 C 语言构建的计算世界是什么样子的了。\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n百度以每年 10 万的价格出租的“虚拟人”\n\r\n百度表示，自去年以来，它为客户做的虚拟人项目数量翻了一番，虚拟人的一些买家包括金融服务公司、地方旅游局和媒体。百度说，随着技术的改进，自去年以来，成本已经下降了约 80%。一个三维虚拟人每年将花费约为 10 万元，一个二维虚拟人则为 2 万元。预计到 2025 年，虚拟人产业总体上将保持每年 50% 的增长。\n\r\n\r\n消息来源：CNBC\n\r\n\r\n\r\n老王点评：至少有一个好处是，不必担心艺人丑闻了。\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n美国结束 3G 网络服务\n\r\nVerizon 正在告诉客户，如果他们仍在使用不支持其较新网络技术的 3G CDMA 手机，“线路将被暂停而不计费，并将失去打电话、发短信或使用数据的能力”。Verizon 是美国三大无线运营商中最后一个关闭 3G 网络并将频谱重新用于更新技术的运营商。AT&T 和 T-Mobile 已于 2022 年分别关闭了其 3G 网络。事实上，Verizon 已经几次推迟了其 3G 网络的关闭。\n\r\n\r\n消息来源：Fierce Wireless\n\r\n\r\n\r\n老王点评：3G 都要被抛弃了，感觉 3G 还是昨天。",

          "description": "我相信几乎所有的 Linux 用户都会保持他们系统的更新。\n\r\n但这种更新通常是针对默认的 包管理器。例如，更新 Ubuntu 往往意味着更新所有的 APT 软件包。\n\r\n然而，还有其他的打包格式，如 Snap 和 Flatpak。Snap 应用程序会自动更新，但 Flatpak 不会。\n\r\n那么你如何更新 Flatpak 软件包呢？好吧，你可以用这个命令来更新所有已安装和可更新的 Flatpak 包：\n\r\nflatpak update\r\n\n\r\n这很简单。但让我再讨论一下关于更新 Flatpak 的一些事情，比如说：\n\r\n\r\n更新所有或特定的 Flatpak 包\n\r\n通过软件中心更新 Flatpak 包\n\r\n\r\n让我们先从终端的方法开始。\n\r\n方法 1：使用终端来更新 Flatpak 包\n\r\n首先让我从最实用的方法开始，你也应该从这个方法开始。\n\r\n更新每一个过时的 Flatpak 包\n\r\n更新现有的 Flatpak 包的整个目录是很容易的。\n\r\n输入给定的命令，就可以得到过期包的列表：\n\r\nflatpak update\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n你只需输入 Y 并按下回车键，就能搞定每一个更新。\n\r\n更新特定的 Flatpak 包\n\r\n要更新特定的软件包，你需要可以更新的软件包的列表。你用的是你之前看到的那个命令。\n\r\nflatpak update\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n从输出中复制你要更新的软件包的名称。在以下命令中使用软件包的名称：\n\r\nflatpak update package_name\r\n\n\r\n例如，如果你想更新 Telegram，下面的命令可以完成这项工作：\n\r\nflatpak update org.telegram.desktop\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n这就完成了。\n\r\n方法 2：从软件中心更新 Flatpak 应用\n\r\n有 Flatpak 内置支持的发行版会在软件中心提供 Flatpak 应用的更新。Fedora 和 Linux Mint 就是这样的发行版。\n\r\n但如果你使用的是 Ubuntu，你就需要在 GNOME 软件中心添加 Flatpak 支持：\n\r\nsudo apt install gnome-software-plugin-flatpak\r\n\n\r\n完成后，你将在 Ubuntu 中拥有两个软件中心。这是因为默认的软件中心不是 GNOME 的，而是 Snap Store。\n\r\n从系统菜单中打开这个新的软件中心：\n\r\n\n\r\n进入“更新Update”页面，你会发现过时的软件包列表。这包括 APT 和 Flatpak 软件包。\n\r\n\n\r\n在这里，你可以一次更新所有的软件包，或者你可以有选择地更新什么。\n\r\n总结\n\r\n许多 Linux 桌面用户往往忘记更新 Flatpak 软件包，因为它们不包括在定期的系统更新中。\n\r\n由于 Flatpak 是一个沙盒式的打包解决方案，你可能不会面临任何与过时的软件包有关的问题，但你肯定会错过新的功能和修复。\n\r\n这就是为什么我建议每隔几周运行一次 Flatpak 更新命令。\n\r\n我希望你喜欢这个快速的 Flatpak 小技巧。\n\r\n\r\nvia: https://itsfoss.com/update-flatpak/\n\r\n作者：Sagar Sharma 选题：lkxed 译者：geekpi 校对：wxy\n\r\n本文由 LCTT 原创编译，Linux中国 荣誉推出",

          "description": "这个 Linux 文件管理器做了你所期望的一切，没有留下不愉快的惊喜。但这里有一些令人惊喜的事情，使它值得一试。\n\r\n\r\nQtFM 是一个简单的文件管理器，旨在通过一个快速直观的界面提供文件管理的基本功能。它适用于 Linux、BSD 和 macOS。\n\r\nQtFM，顾名思义，使用 Qt（规范发音为 “cute”）编程工具包。我在 C++ 和 Python 中使用过 Qt 工具包，使用它总是一种乐趣。它是跨平台的，具有多个有用的抽象级别，因此开发人员不必直接与特定于供应商的 SDK 交互，而且它具有高度可配置性。从用户的角度来看，无论你使用的是最新的硬件还是旧计算机，这都是一种“自然”且快速的体验。\n\r\n使用 QtFM\n\r\nQtFM 没有太多内容。它专注于实现其名称所声称的：Qt 的文件管理器（FM）。其布局可能是你对文件管理器的期望：左侧是常用位置和设备的列表，右侧是文件列表。\n\r\n\n\r\n它只有四个菜单：\n\r\n\r\n文件File：创建新文件或文件夹，打开新选项卡或窗口，或退出应用。\n\r\n编辑Edit：在左侧面板中复制、粘贴、移至垃圾箱或创建新书签。\n\r\n视图View：在列表视图和图标视图之间切换，调整布局。\n\r\n帮助Help：许可信息和在线文档链接。\n\r\n\r\n与 QtFM 交互与你可能习惯使用的任何标准文件管理器的体验大致相同。你可以点击导航、在其默认应用中打开文件、拖放文件和文件夹、复制和粘贴文件和文件夹、启动应用，以及你在与计算机内容交互时执行的任何其他操作。它很熟悉，所以基本上没有学习曲线，也没有不愉快的惊喜。\n\r\n然而，也有一些惊喜。这是我最喜欢的三个。\n\r\n1、将命令放入上下文菜单\n\r\n使用 QtFM，你可以将可以在终端中运行的任何命令添加到右键单击上下文菜单中。例如，假设你想要一个将图像转换为 webp 格式 的选项到右键菜单。无需学习复杂的框架或脚本语言，无需开发插件。你只需 3 个步骤即可完成：\n\r\n\r\n转到 “编辑Edit” 菜单并选择 “设置Settings”。\n\r\n单击 “自定义操作选项卡Custom actions tab”。\n\r\n单击 “添加Add” 按钮并输入要运行的命令，用 %f 代表源文件，用 %n 代表新文件。\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n该操作现在出现在你的 QtFM 上下文菜单中。\n\r\n2、灵活的布局\n\r\nQt 工具包的内置功能之一是它的许多组件（“小部件”）是可分离的。QtFM 利用了这一点，并允许你从 “视图View” 菜单中解锁其布局。解锁后，你可以拖动工具栏和侧面板，将它们固定在窗口周围的新位置。我能够将菜单栏、导航工具栏和 URI 字段组合到一个统一的面板中，并且为了方便，我在窗口的右侧放置了一个文件树。\n\r\n\n\r\n这不需要应用设计甚至配置的特殊知识。你只需解锁、拖放和锁定。\n\r\n3、标签视图\n\r\n许多 Linux 文件管理器提供选项卡的方式与大多数 Web 浏览器相同。这是一个简单的界面技巧，可让你方便地保留多个位置。我不知道它是否真的节省了时间，但我总觉得它确实如此。QtFM 也提供选项卡，我特别喜欢它实现选项卡的方式有两点。\n\r\n首先，选项卡默认位于窗口底部（你可以在 “设置Settings” 中更改它）。因为我倾向于从左到右、从上到下阅读，所以我通常更喜欢在窗口的底部和右端设置“额外”信息。当然，“额外”信息的构成因用户而异，因此我不会责怪任何开发人员将小部件和面板放置在我不会放置小部件和面板的地方。不过，当开发人员不小心同意我的偏好时，这很好。\n\r\n其次，标签是响应式的。只需将鼠标悬停在目标选项卡上，即可将文件或文件夹从一个选项卡拖动到另一个选项卡中。感觉就像从一个窗口拖放到另一个窗口一样自然。\n\r\n安装 QtFM\n\r\n在 Linux 上，你的发行版可能会将 QtFM 打包在它的软件仓库中。如果是这样，你可以使用包管理器进行安装。例如，在 Debian 和基于 Debian 的系统上：\n\r\n$ sudo apt install qtfm\r\n\n\r\n如果你的发行版不提供 QtFM，你可以在其 网站 上找到它的软件包，或者你可以从它的 Git 仓库 下载源码。\n\r\n\r\nvia: https://opensource.com/article/22/12/linux-file-manager-qtfm\n\r\n作者：Seth Kenlon 选题：lkxed 译者：geekpi 校对：wxy\n\r\n本文由 LCTT 原创编译，Linux 中国 荣誉推出",

          "description": "Flatpak 软件包的一个鲜为人知的特点是，它允许你对已安装的应用程序进行降级。下面是如何使用它的方法。\n\r\n\r\n从技术上讲，小版本或次要更新是为了解决问题。但是，当某些更新破坏你当前的工作流程时，情况可能会变得更糟。\n\r\n无论是 Flatpak 包还是 Snap，当出现问题时，一切都会在某个时候崩溃。作为一个沙盒打包方案，它可能不会影响整个系统，但如果你遇到一个让你的应用体验变差的错误，你可能会后悔更新。\n\r\n比如之前 Black Box 的更新就带来了一些错误，无法选择文字！开发人员现在已经解决了这个问题，但在他们没有解决之前，我降级了那个特定的包以使其正常工作。\n\r\n所以，如果你想降级特定的 Flatpak 应用，你可以按照本指南进行操作。\n\r\n在 Linux 中降级 Flatpak 包\n\r\n免责声明： 与安装 Flatpak 不同，你需要 sudo 权限才能降级 Flatpak 包。如果你的用户没有该权限，你可以按照我们关于 如何向用户授予 sudo 访问权限 的详细指南进行操作。\n\r\n以下是步骤：\n\r\n1、获取包的应用 ID\n\r\n第一步是找到要降级的包的应用 ID。你可以列出已安装的软件包轻松找到它：\n\r\nflatpak list --app\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n记下要降级的包的应用 ID。\n\r\n这里，我要降级 Black Box，所以我的应用 ID 将是 com.raggesilver.BlackBox。\n\r\n2、列出以前的版本并获取该提交的代码\n\r\n获得应用 ID 后，你需要列出以前的版本。\n\r\n你可以按照给定的命令语法做到这点：\n\r\nflatpak remote-info --log flathub <Application ID>\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n找到首选的先前版本后，复制如上所示的提交的代码。\n\r\n3、降级 Flatpack 包\n\r\n执行前两个步骤后，你应该有以下内容：\n\r\n\r\n包的应用 ID。\n\r\n首选旧版本的提交代码。\n\r\n\r\n现在，你必须将它们放在以下命令中：\n\r\nsudo flatpak update --commit=<commit_code> <Application ID>\r\n\n\r\n当我将 Black Box 降级到以前的版本时，我将使用以下命令：\n\r\nsudo flatpak update --commit=c4ef3f4be655cbe2559451a9ef5977ab28139c54bb5adbd7db812f3482bd0db5 com.raggesilver.BlackBox\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n这就完成了！\n\r\n要检查你是否已成功降级软件包，你可以列出需要更新的软件包（考虑到其他所有内容都是最新的）。它应该包括你最近降级的软件包的名称：\n\r\nflatpak update\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n如你所见，Black Box 已过时，需要更新，这意味着包已成功降级！\n\r\n总结\n\r\n在本快速教程中，我解释了如何降级 Flatpak 软件包，希望对你有所帮助。\n\r\n如果你有任何疑问或建议，请在评论中告诉我。\n\r\n\r\nvia: https://itsfoss.com/downgrade-flatpak-packages/\n\r\n作者：Sagar Sharma 选题：lkxed 译者：geekpi 校对：wxy\n\r\n本文由 LCTT 原创编译，Linux中国 荣誉推出",

          "description": "利用太阳能、硬件和开源来建立你自己的电动车充电站。\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n也许你讨厌在寒冷或者酷热的时候加油，也许你关心环境问题。也许不断上涨的油价和通胀让你不得不考虑怎么更合理的安排开支。也许你只是认为电动汽车看起来很酷。不管什么原因，你都会因为即将拥有一辆电动汽车而感到激动，激动的不仅仅只有你。电动汽车的市场份额将在 2040 年增长到 30% 。美国政府提供了一个简易的比较工具，用来展示维护一辆电动汽车的花费比维护一辆化石燃料汽车要少很多。尽管如此，电动汽车的充电费用仍然会给你的钱包带来沉重的负担。\n\r\n通常，解决成本问题的最优雅的方法之一是应用开源原则来加速创新。幸运的是，在电动汽车充电领域已经找到了一种获得低成本电力和充电桩的方法。\n\r\n为了控制电动汽车充电的成本，首先，你需要低成本的电力。在过去，这意味着从石油倒退到煤炭。如今，能将太阳能直接转化为电能的 光伏发电solar photovolataic（PV） 设备提供的电力通常被认为成本是最低的。煤炭公司正在因为无法继续与清洁的太阳能竞争而破产。这也是 太阳能发电在世界各地都爆炸性增长 的原因。许多房主把 太阳能电池板放到他们的房顶 或者后院的支架上，以满足他们家庭的电力需求。但是，如果你的屋顶面积有限或者后院很小，你怎样才能使用太能能给你的电动汽车充电呢？\n\r\n开源光伏停车篷\n\r\n大型企业正在采取的一个方法是在他们的停车场上建造一个光伏顶篷。如果你自己想做一个，一个新的 研究 提供了三种新型开源光伏顶篷系统全面的机械和经济方面的分析。\n\r\n\r\n使用纯木材的单一停车位横跨系统\n\r\n使用木材和铝的双停车位横跨系统\n\r\n使用木材和铝的悬臂系统\n\r\n\r\n这些设计是以 5 * 6 个停车位的样式呈现的，但是这三个系统都可以扩展到任何需要的停车位数量。包括一个 6 千瓦的家用单车充电系统（如下图）。所有的支架都有 25 年的预期寿命来配合标准的光伏保修。\n\r\n\n\r\n这些开源光伏顶篷都是为了抵御加拿大残酷的冬天而设计的，它们遵循加拿大严格的建筑规范。所以，不管你住在其他任何地方，这些系统的设计都仍然可以为你工作。顶篷的 完整设计 以及材料清单，包括基本说明都有提供。它们以开源许可的方式发布，保证任何人都可以依照关于 DIY 太阳能收集器的免费书籍 《拥抱太阳To Catch the Sun》 制作它。\n\r\n前面提到的 研究 结果显示，开源设计比专利产品的成本低很多。单跨系统可节省成本 82% 到 85%，双跨系统节省成本 43% 到 50%，悬臂系统节省 31% 到 40% 。\n\r\n最重要的是，这些设计给你提供了足够多的能源（如果你只是正常通勤）来满足你的充电需求。在运行的第一年，光伏顶篷可以提供目前市场上效率最低的电动汽车充电所需电量的 157% 。\n\r\n\n\r\n开源电动汽车充电桩\n\r\n减少电动车维护成本的另一个办法是安装一个开源的电动车充电桩。OpenEVSE 是一个基于 Arduino 的充电桩，由 开源软件 和硬件组成，可以以 DIY 的方式制作。它们体积小，重量轻，便于携带，你可以在家里或者旅途上使用它们。\n\r\nOpenEVSE 为世界各地的许多电动车制造商提供充电站。你可以根据自己的需求调整它。OpenEVSE 已经相当成熟，支持许多先进的功能，包括可调电流，温度检测和实时功率显示。你可以购买预先组装好的硬件马上体验。如果你想体验更多的乐趣节省更多的钱，可以购买一套套件自己动手制作。\n\r\n\n\r\n我希望未来可以看到更多关于电动汽车充电解决方案的设计。睁大眼睛，撸起袖子加油干，享受组装你的开源太阳能充电桩的乐趣。\n\r\n\r\nvia: https://opensource.com/article/22/12/open-source-ev-charging\n\r\n作者：Joshua Pearce 选题：lkxed 译者：duoluoxiaosheng 校对：wxy\n\r\n本文由 LCTT 原创编译，Linux中国 荣誉推出",

          "description": "PCMan 文件管理器是一个让旧电脑感觉更有效率的好选择。\n\r\n\r\nPCMan 文件管理器，或简称 PCManFM，是一个功能齐全的快速轻量级文件管理器。它是为 LXDE 桌面环境开发的，但它是一个独立的应用，可以与你选择的桌面或窗口管理器一起使用。\n\r\n安装 PCManFM\n\r\n在 Linux 上，你可能可以在软件仓库中找到 PCManFM。例如，在 Fedora、Mageia 和类似软件上：\n\r\n$ sudo dnf install pcmanfm\r\n\n\r\n在 Debian、Elementary 和类似系统上：\n\r\n$ sudo apt install pcmanfm\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n不必用 PCManFM 替换你的桌面文件管理器，但某些发行版认为当你安装“第三方”文件管理器时，你会希望它优先于默认的文件管理器。根据你使用的桌面，有不同的方法来设置默认文件管理器。通常，它位于 系统设置System Settings 下的 默认应用Default Applications 中。\n\r\n如果你的桌面环境或窗口管理器没有选择默认应用的界面，你可以在 ~/.local/share/applications/mimeapps.list 文件中设置你的首选项。要将一个文件管理器指定为默认的，请将其放在 [Default Applications] 部分的顶部，首先指定文件类型，然后指定你想用于打开的应用文件的名称（在 /usr/share/applications 下）：\n\r\ninode/directory=myfilemanager.desktop;\r\n\n\r\nPCManFM\n\r\n如果你是 GNOME 2 或 Mate 项目的 Caja 文件管理器 的粉丝，那么 PCManFM 是一个不错的选择。PCManFM 在设计上很像 Caja，但它不像 Caja 那样绑定到桌面，所以它甚至可以在最新的 GNOME 桌面上使用。\n\r\nPCManFM 的默认布局在窗口顶部附近有一个有用的工具栏，一个提供对常用目录和驱动器的快速访问的侧面板，以及一个包含有关你当前选择的详细信息的状态栏。你可以使用 视图View 菜单隐藏或显示这些元素中的任何一个。\n\r\n选项卡和面板\n\r\nPCManFM 也使用选项卡。如果你以前从未使用过选项卡式文件管理器，那么想想 Web 浏览器以及它如何使用选项卡让你在一个窗口中打开多个网页。PCManFM 可以类似地在同一窗口中打开多个目录。\n\r\n要将文件或文件夹从一个选项卡传输到另一个选项卡，只需将文件的图标拖动到选项卡并悬停即可。少许延迟后，PCManFM 将目标选项卡置于最前面，以便你可以继续进行拖放操作。如果你不习惯与文件管理器中的选项卡进行交互，则需要一些时间来适应，但这不会花很长时间，而且它是整理工作区的一项非常强大的功能。\n\r\nPCManFM 界面的另一个不错的功能是它能够将一个窗口分成两个面板。每个面板实际上都是一个选项卡，但每个面板只占窗口的一半。\n\r\n\n\r\n这使得从一个面板拖到另一个面板就像将文件拖到文件夹中一样简单自然。我发现它对于比较文件夹的内容也很有用。\n\r\n使用 PCMan 进行文件管理\n\r\nPCManFM 是一款很棒的小型文件管理器，具有你日常所需的所有基本功能。它是你可能会觉得过于复杂的文件管理器的自然替代品，也是 老旧计算机 上的一个很好的选择，这些电脑可能对不断绘制缩略图、刷新和生成动画的文件管理器举步维艰。PCMan 专注于文件管理器的核心任务：管理文件。在你的 Linux 电脑上试试吧。\n\r\n\r\nvia: https://opensource.com/article/22/12/linux-file-manager-pcmanfm\n\r\n作者：Seth Kenlon 选题：lkxed 译者：geekpi 校对：wxy\n\r\n本文由 LCTT 原创编译，Linux中国 荣誉推出",

          "description": "看看这两个你可以为你的家庭建造的开源的光伏支架设计。\n\r\n\r\n你可能已经考虑过用太阳能为你的家供电。将太阳光直接转化为电能的太阳能光伏电池板的成本已大幅下降，因此在任何地方都具有经济意义。这就是为什么大公司投入大量太阳能，甚至电力公司也开始安装大型太阳能发电场的原因，因为它的成本低于过时的化石燃料。像大多数房主一样，你想省钱并节省电费，但你可能对前期费用有点畏缩。为了大致了解成本，一个 5 千瓦系统，以 3 美元/瓦的价格为普通家庭供电，成本约为 15,000 美元，而更大的家庭可能需要 10 千瓦才能满足所有电力购买，成本为 30,000 美元。如果你想要电池，成本加倍（你不需要电池，因为大多数太阳能电池阵列连接到电网，但如果电网瘫痪，你的太阳能电池阵列也会瘫痪，直到它重新开启）。支付你未来几十年所有的电费是一种投资，即使你存了很多钱。\n\r\n有一些好消息。首先，美国和加拿大都对太阳能实行了 30% 的税收抵免。此项优惠将价格降至约 2 美元/瓦。其次，我们之前讨论 过你可以获得一本免费书籍 《捕捉阳光》，它会引导你完成如何设计自己的系统（你仍然需要一个合格的电工和检查来把它连接到电网）。如果你有一点手艺，你可以将剩余成本削减约 50%。这些成本主要用于材料，包括太阳能电池板、布线、电子设备和支架。令人惊讶的是，对于小型太阳能系统（比如你家的太阳能系统）来说，太阳能电池板的成本下降得如此之低，以至于支架（支撑太阳能电池板的机械结构）的成本可能比面板还高！\n\r\n开源再次拯救\n\r\n将开源开发范式应用于软件可以加快创新速度、改进产品并降低成本。开源硬件也是如此，甚至在光伏支架这个相对不为人知的领域也是如此。几乎所有的商业光伏支架都是由专有的奇特铝型材制成。它们会花很多钱。如果你有一些没有遮挡的后院，有一些开源的支架解决方案可以选择。\n\r\n开源太阳能支架设计\n\r\n第一个 DIY 太阳能支架设计符合以下标准：（1） 由当地可获得的可再生材料制成，（2） 25 年的使用寿命与太阳能保修相匹配，（3）能够由普通消费者制造，（4）能够符合加拿大结构建筑规范（如果你住在没有雪的地方，这有点矫枉过正，但是，嘿，你可能有其他极端天气需要应对，例如飓风），（5）低成本，（6）它是共享的，使用开源许可证。开源的木质固定倾斜地面安装双面光伏支架设计 在整个北美都适用。与商业专有支架相比，该支架系统可节省 49% 至 77%。然而，支架设计高度依赖于世界各地不同的木材成本。\n\r\n在深入研究这个开源设计之前，请检查你当地的木材成本。\n\r\n\n\r\n如果你更喜欢冒险，你可能会考虑第二种允许改变倾斜角度的设计。第二项研究 的结果表明，具有最佳可变季节性倾斜角的支架系统具有最佳的终身能量产生，与固定倾斜系统相比，产生的能量多 5.2%（或者，如果最大倾斜角限制为 60°，能量多 4.8%）。固定和可变木制支架系统的电力成本相似，仅为专有商业金属货架的 29%。可变倾斜支架提供了最低成本的选择，即使包括适度的劳动力成本，也可能为 农业光伏 等应用提供特定优势（即，你可以在面板下面种菜，对于莴苣等耐阴作物来说，能惊人地增加产量）。此设计已通过 具有 CERN-OHL-S-2.0 许可证的 OSHWA 的认证。\n\r\n\n\r\n所示的 2 个光伏模块架中的每一个大约有 1 千瓦。所以一所房子大约需要五个。这两篇论文都提供了完整的计算和分步建造说明。\n\r\n正如拥有太阳能系统的任何人都会告诉你的那样，获得负电费是非常有益的。如果你的系统规模能满足你所有的负荷，并且住在该国的净计量地区，就会出现这种情况。请注意，电力公司不会向你付款；额度会一直延续到你在冬天使用它为止。\n\r\n享受一点开源太阳能带来的乐趣！\n\r\n\r\nvia: https://opensource.com/article/22/12/open-source-solar-power-home\n\r\n作者：Joshua Pearce 选题：lkxed 译者：geekpi 校对：wxy\n\r\n本文由 LCTT 原创编译，Linux中国 荣誉推出",

          "description": "JFileProcessor 作为一个 Linux 文件管理器，在设计和功能上都采取了极简理念。\n\r\n\r\n计算机是一个奇特的文件柜，里面装满了虚拟文件夹和文件，等待着被引用、交叉引用、编辑、更新、保存、复制、移动、重命名和归类。在本文中，我将介绍一下 Linux 系统的文件管理器。\n\r\n在 昇阳微系统Sun Microsystem 时代的末期，出现了一种叫做 Java 桌面系统Java Desktop System 的东西，奇怪的是它 不是 用 Java 编写的。相反，它是（根据当时的 sun.com 上的描述）“对集成和优化的桌面软件的明智选择，大部分基于开源代码和开放标准”。它基于 GNOME，带有办公套件、电子邮件和日历应用、即时消息和“Java 技术”。我发现自己在思考用 Java 创建桌面需要什么。客观地说，桌面实际上并不包括那么多东西。一般的共识似乎是桌面由面板、系统托盘、应用菜单和文件管理器组成。\n\r\n想象一个实际的 Java 桌面是一个有趣的思维练习。虽然不足以以此为目标启动一个开源项目，但足以在网络上快速搜索必要的组件。事实证明，有人用 Java 编写并维护了一个文件管理器。\n\r\nJFileProcessor\n\r\n我找到的 Java 文件管理器叫做 JFileProcessor，简称 JFP。它不仅是用 Java 编写的，更具体是说是用 Groovy（一种流行的 Java 脚本语言）进行的一项迷人的实践。\n\r\n\n\r\n作为文件管理器，JFileProcessor 在设计和功能上都采用了极简方式。它允许你查看、打开、移动、复制、剪切或删除本地系统和远程系统上的文件。它不是特别定制化的，它没有如拆分面板或可移动面板等额外功能。除了管理文件外，它没什么别的中心主题。JFileProcessor 在某种程度上令人耳目一新，因为它很简单。这是一个文件管理器，仅此而已。有时这就是你在文件管理器中想要的全部。\n\r\n我之前写过关于 设置 Java Swing 主题 的方式，从技术上讲，该技术可以应用于这个开源应用。但是，我认为这个应用的部分魅力在于 OpenSolaris 称之为 “Blueprint” 的主题。这是 Java 的怀旧外观，我喜欢以其原生 GUI 外观运行它，作为对我的 OpenSolaris（现为 OpenIndiana）笔记本电脑的回忆。\n\r\n用户体验\n\r\n除了设计，真正重要的是用户体验。JFileProcessor 只有三个你日常使用的按钮：向上、后退和前进。它们未绑定到键盘快捷键，因此你必须单击按钮才能导航（或使用 Tab 键选择按钮）。在使用图形应用时，我经常使用键盘快捷键，所以当我尝试浏览我的系统时，这大大减慢了我的速度。但是，有时我实际上只是懒洋洋地浏览文件，因此 JFileProcessor 完全按照我的需要工作。\n\r\nJFileProcessor 也有一个搜索组件。只要你设置合理的起始文件夹，搜索就会快速而智能，同时允许使用通配符和正则模式搜索。例如，当我搜索特定的电子书或漫画档案或游戏规则手册时，或者当我粗略地知道该目录包含一个项目但懒得一直点击到目的地址。在子目录中快速搜索，必然会得到明显的结果，然后双击打开文件，不管我设置了什么 XDG 偏好（Evince 用于 PDF，Foliate 用于电子书，等等）。\n\r\n右键单击任何文件或目录会弹出上下文菜单。它具有你期望的大部分常见任务：复制、剪切、粘贴、删除、重命名、新建。它也有一些不错的额外功能。\n\r\n\n\r\n例如，你可以只将文件名复制到剪贴板或保存文件路径。你还可以运行一些脚本，包括用于批量重命名文件的脚本、用于对选定文件运行命令的脚本、用于创建 ZIP 或 TAR 存档的脚本等等。当然，编码器有多种选择，包括在当前位置打开终端和打开新的编码窗口。\n\r\n安装\n\r\n我是 Java 的忠实粉丝。它是一种清晰的语言，具有合理的分隔符和对跨平台兼容性的坚定立场。我喜欢它作为一种语言，我喜欢看到程序员用它创造的东西。\n\r\nJFileProcessor 的名字很贴切。这是一种处理文件的有效方法，从某种意义上说，JFileProcessor 为你提供了一个简单的窗口来查看系统上的文件数据，并允许你以图形方式与它们进行交互，就像你可能在终端中与它们交互一样。它不是我用过的最高效的文件管理器，也不是功能最多的一个。然而，这是一个令人愉快的应用，为你提供了文件管理所需的基本工具，其相对较小的代码库使你可以在下午阅读一些精彩的内容。\n\r\n\r\nvia: https://opensource.com/article/22/12/linux-file-manager-jfileprocessor\n\r\n作者：Seth Kenlon 选题：lkxed 译者：geekpi 校对：wxy\n\r\n本文由 LCTT 原创编译，Linux中国 荣誉推出",

          "description": "理解 OSI 框架的基本概念，掌握计算机系统通信机制。\n\r\n\r\n开放系统互联Open Systems Interconnection（OSI）模型是一个定义计算机、服务器和用户如何在一个系统内通信的标准。它是第一个网络通信标准模型，在上世纪 80 年代早期，所有主流的计算机和通信公司都采用了这个标准。\n\r\nOSI 模型提供了一种用于描述网络的通用语言，并以离散的块或层的方式来描述。\n\r\nOSI 模型的各个层\n\r\n该模型描述了计算机系统通过网络进行通信的七个层。\n\r\n\r\n7 应用层\n\r\n6 表示层\n\r\n5 会话层\n\r\n4 传输层\n\r\n3 网络层\n\r\n2 数据链路层\n\r\n1 物理层\n\r\n\r\n每个层都有自己的工作方式和一系列跟其他层不同的协议。本文将逐个剖析这些层级。\n\r\n应用层\n\r\n应用层是在软件中实现的。它是与应用程序交互的层级。\n\r\n用发送消息作为例子。发送消息的程序与应用层进行交互，并发送消息。接着，应用层向 OSI 模型的下一个层级（即表示层）发送消息。\n\r\n表示层\n\r\n来自应用层的数据被转发到表示层。表示层接收到文字、字符、字母、数字等形式的数据，并把它们转换为机器可识读的二进制格式数据。这个过程叫做编译。\n\r\n在此阶段，ASCII（美国信息交换标准码）字符被转换为扩充的二进制编码的十进制交换码（EBCDIC）。转换后的数据在继续传输前，也会进行编码和加密过程，使用 SSL 协议进行加密和解密。\n\r\n表示层的作用是抽象化，它假设下面的层级会处理它们收到的数据。它也负责压缩数据。数据的压缩可能是有损的，也有可能是无损的，这取决于很多因素，这不属于本文的讨论范围。\n\r\n会话层\n\r\n会话层的作用是建立和管理连接。该层级的主要工作是建立会话。例如，你登录网上商城，就在你的机器和服务器之间建立了会话。\n\r\n会话层的作用是实现数据的发送和接收，完成后连接的会话就终止了。在一个会话建立前，会进行身份验证。与上一层类似，会话层也假设在它的工作完成后，下面的层级也会准确无误地处理数据。\n\r\n传输层\n\r\n传输层的作用是管理数据传输和其自身的关于数据如何传输的一些协议。从会话层传到这里的数据被分为更小的数据单元，这些数据单元称为片段。这个过程叫做“分段”。每个片段包含来源端口号、目标端口号和一个序列号。端口号用来识别发送数据的应用程序。注意，数据以块的形式传输。序列号用于把这些片段按正确的顺序排列。\n\r\n传输层负责控制流量或在给定的时间内传输的数据量。它也负责错误控制，比如数据丢失、损坏等情况。它利用一种错误检测值，通常叫做校验和。传输层对每个数据片段加上校验和，就可以检查所发送的数据是否被正确接收。然后数据传输到网络层。\n\r\n网络层\n\r\n网络层的作用是跟其他网络进行通信。它把从一台机器接收到的数据片段传输给另一台位于不同网络的机器。路由器是作用于网络层的。\n\r\n网络层的功能是逻辑寻址（就是确定 IP 地址）。它为发送方和接收方分配 IP 地址，数据包附带了这个地址，就可以被传输到正确的目标机器。接着网络层对数据包进行路由。负载均衡也是在网络层进行的，旨在确保不会发生过载。下一步，数据传输到数据链路层。\n\r\n数据链路层\n\r\n数据链路层支持跟其他设备直接通信。\n\r\n它接收到来自网络层、包含发送方和接收方 IP 地址的数据包，进行物理寻址，然后将发送方和接收方的 MAC 地址分配给数据包，形成帧。\n\r\n物理层\n\r\n物理层由系统的所有硬件和物理设备（包括网线、导航系统、适配器等）组成。在这里，从前面层级接收到的数据都是 0 和 1 形式的。物理层把这些数据转换并通过各种方式（如果是光纤电缆，有电线、电信号、光信号；如果是 WIFI，则为无线电信号）传输至本地媒介。\n\r\n注意，物理层作用于接收方的一端，把接收到的信号以帧的形式传输到数据链路层（把它转换回二进制数据形式）。然后帧传输到上面的层级，最终应用层（应用软件）会接收到需要的数据。\n\r\n结语\n\r\n当你需要描述网络架构或排除网络问题时，OSI 模型的相关知识会对你有所帮助。我希望本文能令你对这个模型的方方面面有清晰的理解。\n\r\n\r\nvia: https://opensource.com/article/22/10/osi-model-network-communications\n\r\n作者：Anamika 选题：lkxed 译者：cool-summer-021 校对：wxy\n\r\n本文由 LCTT 原创编译，Linux中国 荣誉推出",

          "description": "Linux Mint 是一款极好的 Linux 发行版，特别适合初学者。\n\r\n我喜欢它仍然保持常见的 Ubuntu/Debian 习惯，但是它还做了一些 比 Ubuntu 更好的 工作，其中之一就是它没有使用 Snap。\n\r\n然而，我不是 Cinnamon 桌面环境的粉丝，因为我从来没有真正地喜欢过 Windows XP 或 7 的默认设置。\n\r\n当我寻求保持 Linux Mint 稳定的同时而提供 GNOME 的能力时，这便是我最终获得的结果：\n\r\n\n\r\n不太炫，这就是我运行 GNOME 42.5 的 Linux Mint 21 。\n\r\n如果你想在 Linux Mint 上安装 GNOME ，那么这篇指南非常适合你。\n\r\n在 Linux Mint 上安装GNOME 之前所要知道的事\n\r\n要在 Mint 上安装 GNOME，你务必需要有足够的理由。如果你只是为了尝鲜，可以在虚拟机中尝试。我使用 在 VirtualBox 中安装的 Linux Mint 来演示这篇教程。\n\r\n安装除发行版提供的桌面环境之外的其他桌面环境，移除桌面环境部分会使其变成一件很复杂的事。\n\r\nCinnamon 使用了一些 GNOME 元素。如果你决定稍后移除 GNOME ，这可能会影响到 Cinnamon 的一部分功能。\n\r\n这可能会导致缺少实战经验用户的恐慌。当然，在 TTY 屏幕中重新安装 Cinnamon 桌面环境可能是一种可行的解决方案。\n\r\n最重要的一点是，如果你很容易惊慌地不知所措和不喜欢解决难题，那么你就不应该在你的主力计算机上做这些 “试验” 。\n\r\n抛开这些顾虑，让我们看看在 Linux Mint 上获取 GNOME 的简单过程。\n\r\n在 Linux Mint 上安装 GNOME 桌面环境\n\r\n在这里，你有两个选项：1、你可以使用包含所有的 GNOME 实用程序的完整的 GNOME 桌面，2、你也可以使用包含极少数软件包的 GNOME 精简版本。\n\r\n我都将讲解一下。\n\r\n为 安装精简版本的 GNOME ，你需要安装一个名称为 vanilla-gnome-desktop 的软件包，使用下面给定的命令：\n\r\nsudo apt install vanilla-gnome-desktop\r\n\n\r\n如果你想要完整的 GNOME 体验 ，你可以简单地安装 gnome 软件包：\n\r\nsudo apt install gnome\r\n\n\r\n在你执行上述任一个命令后，在接下来的步骤中将会要求你选择首选的显示管理器。\n\r\n\n\r\ngdm3 是 GNOME 桌面的显示管理器，而 Linux Mint 使用 lightdm 作为默认的显示管理器，这两种显示器都可以正常工作，但是，我建议你使用 gdm3 来获取完整的 GNOME 体验。\n\r\n切换到 GNOME\n\r\n在完成后，注销并按一次回车键，在这里，你将看到一个小齿轮图标。从这里选择 “GNOME” ：\n\r\n\n\r\n现在，你拥有以 Linux Mint 为基础的 GNOME 桌面环境！\n\r\n额外提示：如何应用整体风格一致的主题\n\r\n你可以继续使用 Cinnamon 桌面的主题，但是它们大多不能如前工作，因此，我建议使用 GNOME 桌面的主题（例如 Adwaita ）来保持桌面环境的一致性。\n\r\n对我而言，其默认的字体没有一点效果。并且，我更喜欢 Fedora 提供的一些字体。因此，从系统菜单打开 GNOME 调整GNOME tweaks，并作出如下更改:\n\r\n\n\r\n这里是我使用的一些设置：\n\r\n\r\nCantarell Regular (11) 用于界面和文档文本。\n\r\nNoto Sans Mono Regular (13) 用于等宽字体文本。\n\r\nCantarell Bold (11) 用于窗口标题。\n\r\n\r\n它们的结果是，比默认的 Ubuntu 字体方案要好得多。\n\r\n既然你有了 GNOME ，你可以使用我们的详细指南来安装和 更改 Linux 上的 GNOME 主题，来使其成为你所梦想的样子。\n\r\n总结\n\r\n如你所见，在 Linux Mint 上安装 GNOME 是非常简单的。正如我先前所提到的那样，移除部分可能会使事情复杂化，因为这可能会移除一些 Cinnamon 所需要的一些 GNOME 软件包。\n\r\n你现在的主力计算机系统是什么？我的是 Pop!_OS 。\n\r\n\r\nvia: https://itsfoss.com/install-gnome-linux-mint/\n\r\n作者：Sagar Sharma 选题：lkxed 译者：robsean 校对：wxy\n\r\n本文由 LCTT 原创编译，Linux中国 荣誉推出",

          "description": "Nemo 感觉像是更新版的 GNOME 2 文件管理器。我喜欢它，我觉得你也会喜欢它。\n\r\n\r\n计算机是一个奇特的文件柜，里面装满了虚拟文件夹和文件，等待着被引用、交叉引用、编辑、更新、保存、复制、移动、重命名和归类。在本文中，我将介绍一下 Linux 系统的文件管理器。\n\r\nCinnamon 项目是使用 GNOME 3 的组件重新实现的 GNOME 2。最终，它的差异足以成为一个真正的分叉，如今，Cinnamon 桌面使用 GTK3 库和 GNOME 3 关键应用的分叉版本来创建一个“经典”的 GNOME 体验。对传统的 GNOME 体验做出贡献的组件之一是 Nemo，它是一个基于 GNOME 2 版本的 Nautilus 的文件管理器。\n\r\n在 Linux 上安装 Nemo\n\r\nNemo 的源代码 在线提供，但它需要 cinnamon-desktop 来构建，所以安装 Nemo 最简单的方法是直接安装 Cinnamon。\n\r\n在 Fedora、Mageia 和类似的系统上：\n\r\n$ sudo dnf install cinnamon-desktop\r\n\n\r\n在 Linux Mint、Debian 和类似系统上：\n\r\n$ sudo dnf install cinnamon-desktop-environment\r\n\n\r\n当然，作为该桌面的发源地，Linux Mint 也预装了 Cinnamon。\n\r\n一个熟悉的界面\n\r\n如果你已经习惯了 GNOME，无论是过去的还是现在的，那么 Nemo 从一开始就让你有一种回家的感觉。它有一个熟悉的外观和感觉，在类似的地方有按钮和选项，你很可能会认出它们。\n\r\n\n\r\n将视图控制按钮放在右上方的 GNOME 式惯例被保留了下来，你可以使用这些按钮快速地将你的文件视图从大图标切换到详细列表或紧凑视图。那里还有一个搜索功能，以及在可编辑文本和按钮之间切换位置栏的选项。\n\r\n可编辑的 URI 栏有时被低估了。这是一个简单的设计决定，但它可以是一个有助于提高效率的巨大功能。这就像在每个窗口的顶部有一个单行终端，你可以在那里输入你的系统的任何目标位置，并立即被带到那里。而且你甚至不需要输入 cd。\n\r\n在左上角，有导航按钮：向上、向前和向后。与许多 Linux 文件管理器一样，你可以用 Alt 键加上适当的 箭头 键，而放弃使用这些按钮。\n\r\n侧面窗格显示了重要文件夹的列表（主目录、文档、下载等），可以通过点击窗口底部的一个按钮来隐藏或显示。\n\r\n熟悉但不一样\n\r\nNemo 的舒适性和熟悉性并不意味着它只是无意识地模仿 Nautilus。Nemo 有一系列不错的功能，感觉很独特。其中大部分都在 偏好设置Preferences 中，以下是我最喜欢的几个：\n\r\n\r\n窗口标题中显示全路径Full path in window title：这是我最喜欢的功能。不要再怀疑你在文件系统中的位置了。让你的窗口标题告诉你。\n\r\n单击或双击Single or double click：如果你是一个长期的 KDE 用户，你可能会发现单次点击打开一个文件是很新鲜的。有了 Nemo，你可以这样选择。\n\r\n双击来重命名Double-click to rename：如果你使用单击来打开，为什么不重新利用双击来重命名呢？\n\r\n在新窗口中打开每个文件夹Open each folder in a new window：操作系统为每一个打开的文件夹打开一个新的窗口。\n\r\n插件Plugins：Nemo 有能力调用动作、脚本和扩展。有些已经包括在内，有改变桌面背景、创建启动器和挂载归档的动作。其他的还没有被创建，但这种可扩展性对开源是至关重要的。\n\r\n\r\n一切近在咫尺\n\r\n在 Linux Mint 上使用 Nemo 几周后，一个有趣的特征让我眼前一亮。似乎 Nemo 可以，或者通过快速配置可以，让我最常使用的所有东西都近在咫尺。许多功能，我承认，我不知道我是否需要，直到 Nemo 让我轻松点击才知道。你可能会说，我是为了满足 Nemo 的设计而改变了我的使用方式，也许情况确实如此。但是，当这种体验是如此令人愉快和有效时，这有什么关系呢？\n\r\nNemo 是一个很好的文件管理器。它让人想起了 GNOME 2 的时代，但其更新和设计选择让人有一种新鲜的感觉。如果你喜欢 Thunar 或 Nautilus，你会喜欢 Nemo。\n\r\n\r\nvia: https://opensource.com/article/22/12/linux-file-manager-nemo\n\r\n作者：Seth Kenlon 选题：lkxed 译者：geekpi 校对：wxy\n\r\n本文由 LCTT 原创编译，Linux中国 荣誉推出",

          "description": "距去年总结的《月光博客2021年推荐阅读文章》已经有一年多的时间了，现在，旧的一年已经过去，新的一年已经到来，为了让大家不错过任何一篇好文章，我这里推荐一些全年度我觉得写的比较精彩、比较有意义的文章给大家。推荐文章的列表如下。\n\r\n\r\n\n怎样才能做到理性中立客观？\n\r\n\r\n理中客，即理性、中立、客观三者的缩略词，是一套价值观念。理性中立客观是指在讨论或分析问题时，尽可能地摒弃个人情绪、偏见和价值观，从事实和逻辑的角度来看待问题。这样做的目的是为了尽可能地接近真相，使得讨论和分析的结论更加可信和有价值。\n\r\n\r\n\niPhone手机APP的安全使用建议\n\r\n\r\n在之前的文章《iPhone手机安全指南》，介绍了iPhone手机系统上使用的一些安全建议，下面将介绍一些iPhone手机APP的安全建议。\n\r\n\r\n\n解决Chrome浏览器翻译无法使用\n\r\n\r\n由于谷歌翻译退出中国，目前，谷歌浏览器Chrome的翻译功能也无法使用，根据科技博客TechCrunch的消息称，谷歌发言人通过电子邮件告诉TechCrunch，该公司由于“使用率低”的原因，已停止中国大陆的谷歌翻译服务。这一变化也影响了中国用户曾经可以使用的谷歌浏览器Chrome内置翻译功能。\n\r\n\r\n\n《风骚律师》主要人物性格分析和结局\n\r\n\r\n看完《绝命毒师》的影迷是不会错过《风骚律师》的，《风骚律师》完全克隆了《绝命毒师》的摄影风格，适合《绝命毒师》的粉丝观看，不是特别适合没看过《绝命毒师》的观众，很多细节或者梗，要看了《绝命毒师》才能明白。\n\r\n\r\n\n慎用深圳电信DNS\n\r\n\r\n使用深圳电信的宽带拨号上网的时候，如果不手动设置DNS，拨号后会使用系统默认设置的DNS：深圳电信的DNS，这个DNS存在很多问题，建议电信用户使用更为专业有效的国内公共DNS，例如阿里DNS、腾讯DNS等。\n\r\n\r\n\n免费运营维护网站指南\n\r\n\r\n众所周知，运营和维护一个网站需要花不少费用和时间精力，如果网站数量众多的话，网站的运营和维护成本就非常高昂，如何才能长时间（十年以上的时间）零成本的维护一个网站，或者使用极低的成本（每年50美元以下）维护一个网站，实际上并不容易，这里就介绍一些我总结的经验和方法。\n\r\n\r\n\n我看俄罗斯入侵乌克兰\n\r\n\r\n2022年2月24日清晨，俄罗斯总统普京发表公开电视演说，宣告以“去军事化”及“去纳粹化”为名对乌克兰采取“特别军事行动”，随后兵分三路入侵乌克兰，轰炸其包括首都基辅在内的多个城市及军事设施、登陆敖德萨港并朝哈尔科夫进攻。\n\r\n\r\n\n为什么中国企业喜欢赚快钱\n\r\n\r\n俞敏洪曾表示：1，国内的“企业家”都是想赚快钱；2，阿里、腾讯、拼多多是迎合消费者的低级趣味来搞钱；3，国内多数“高科技”企业对不起“高科技”三个字；4，国内企业宁愿花几百亿去开发游戏，也不愿意开发工业软件、制造件等；5，中国遍地都是投机商。\n\r\n\r\n\n使用正则表达式进行中文排版\n\r\n\r\n中文排版是字处理的一个基本功能，目前有些文字排版软件，例如“排版助手”等等，可以完成一些通用的中文排版功能，但是对于一些复杂的个性化排版功能就无法实现，实际上，我们通过在一些常用的支持正则的代码编辑软件里，使用正则表达式，就可以完成很多复杂的排版功能，下面将举一些常用的例子。\n\r\n\r\n\n微信和邮件哪个更适合工作？\n\r\n\r\n据《2018中国移动消费者调研》显示，中国人查看电子邮件的次数与全球用户相比少22%。在中国，工作中最常被使用的是微信：根据企鹅智酷发布的《2017微信用户&生态研究报告》，在2万受访人群中，80%以上的人会使用微信办公，而通过电子邮件办公的仅占22.6%，继电话、短信和传真与QQ排在第四位。\n\r\n\r\n\n十大国外常用网盘推荐\n\r\n\r\n网盘，又称网络硬盘、网络磁盘、网络空间、云端硬盘等，是提供文件托管和文件上下载服务的网站（File hosting service），它们大部分是类似FTP的网络服务，加入简易的上下载功能，旨在方便用户访问文件，大多数网盘都宣称可以取代移动硬盘、U盘。免费网络硬盘的可用空间较少，一般对文件大小、下载速度、存放时间等作出限制；付费的网络硬盘能提供大量空间，文件大小、下载速度、存放时间及格式都不限制；邮箱所提供的附件功能是最早的网络硬盘，随着空间的增大，附件功能分立成网络硬盘。\n\r\n\r\n\n屯粮储备手册\n\r\n\r\n内容简介：屯粮的方法（用于保存一年以上食物）：1、主食：密封的大米、面粉、干豆；2、食用油；3、调味品：盐、糖、高度酒、干货；4、肉菜：冷冻肉、冷冻蔬菜（美式杂菜）；5、罐头；6、饮品：咖啡豆、茶叶、奶粉。保存方法是：1、常温类：抽干空气密封并放在背光处。2、冷冻类：放入冰箱冷冻室。",

          "description": "据报道，埃隆·马斯克（Elon Musk）入主Twitter后给这家社交媒体公司带来了剧变，有时甚至在内部引发强烈的反作用，不过，这位亿万富豪似乎将此归咎于成长的烦恼。\n\r\n\r\n“一开始，我们显然会犯许多错误，毕竟我是新来的——嘿，新来乍到，多多包涵。”他在一次“All-In”播客节目上说，“我觉得我今后会少犯些错误。”\n\r\n\r\n除了令Twitter官司缠身的大规模裁员外，马斯克还暂停了付费认证等新功能的实施，甚至缩减了负责监控不良内容的员工数量。他最近还封杀了多位记者的帐号，并引发了广泛批评。\n\r\n\r\n作为该节目的主持人之一，投资者大卫·弗雷德伯格（David Friedberg）提到了围绕“产品迭代”出现的争议，以及“在缺乏沟通的情况下采取快速行动所产生的负面反馈”。\n\r\n\r\n马斯克用棒球打了一个比方，他对弗雷德伯格说：“我们要在Twitter打一个全垒打，而且要尽快做到，”即便要因此“多一点三振出局”也在所不惜。\n\r\n\r\n马斯克还为Twitter本月推出的“阅读量”功能辩护，这个功能可以展示有多少人看过某一条推文。很多用户批评该功能让整个界面变得凌乱不堪，但马斯克却表示，阅读量功能的“实施难度远超你的想象”。\n\r\n\r\n马斯克还承认，Twitter系统内仍有许多机器人，但他入主之后已经“采取许多措施减少机器人和喷子”。\n\r\n\r\n弗雷德伯格还提到了马斯克对科技企业CEO的影响，使他们着迷于不受董事会的约束。马斯克似乎承认，绝对权力可能蕴含一些风险。\n\r\n\r\n“我想我在某种意义上是幸运的，我不必回答问题，这不会公开，我们没有董事会。”他说，“我可以采取一些极端行动。显然，如果我犯了大量错误，Twitter就不会成功，那会令人尴尬和难过。”\n\r\n\r\n为了缓解担忧，他再次用棒球做比：“只要击球率很好……未来就差不了。”\n\r\n\r\n稿源：新浪网",

          "description": "Twitter正在推出一项功能，显示有多少人浏览你的推文，类似于YouTube等平台上显示视频被浏览次数的功能。目前，Twitter已经有一个功能，显示关于你的推文的更详细的分析，而不仅仅是喜欢、转发和引用推文。\n\r\n\r\n\"Twitter正在推出View Count，这样你就可以看到一条推文被浏览了多少次！这对视频来说很正常。这对视频来说是正常的，\"埃隆-马斯克在一条推文中写道。\"显示了Twitter比它看起来要活跃得多，因为90%以上的Twitter用户都在阅读，但不会发推文、回复或喜欢，因为这些都是公共行为。\"\n\r\n\r\n此前，用户在发布的内容下点击\"查看推文分析\"，就可以看到人们是如何与你的推文互动的，比如点击查看个人资料或展开引用推文的细节。不仅如此，还可以看到总的展示数字，这被定义为\"这条推文在Twitter上被看到的次数\"。\n\r\n\r\n新的浏览量功能的不同之处在于，现在，浏览量将对所有人可见，而不仅仅是账户的所有者。\n\r\n\r\n现在还不是所有的用户都能使用这个功能，因为推广到所有用户需要时间。应用研究员Nima Owji展示了该功能的实际效果，并补充说，看起来这只对12月15日之后发布的推文有效。\n\r\n\r\nTwitter的产品推广一直是一波三折--还记得不到一周前，你可能因为在Twitter上发布你的Instagram链接而被短暂禁止吗？这并没有持续很久。在过去的几天里，值得庆幸的是，Twitter似乎在优先考虑不那么有分歧的功能更新。\n\r\n\r\n周三，Twitter更新了其现金标签系统，这样你只需在搜索栏中输入$ETH或$GOOG之类的东西，就可以看到股票或加密货币的价格。\n\r\n\r\n稿源：cnbeta",

          "description": "路透社22日报道，路透社看到的一封邮件显示，TikTok的母公司中国“字节跳动”（ByteDance）周四表示，一些员工不当获取了两名美国记者的TikTok用户数据，涉事的一名员工辞职，三人被解雇。\n\r\n\r\n据《纽约时报》报道，字节跳动行政总裁梁汝波在致员工的一封电邮称，公司内部调查发现有员工不当获取了少量美国TikTok用户的数据，包括两名记者；调查由外部律师行进行。\n\r\n\r\n据TikTok法律总顾问安德森（Erich Andersen）星期四（12月22日）的另一封电邮，字节跳动在今年夏季为调查公司对媒体的泄密来源，成立了一个内部调查组。调查人员在过程中查看一些记者账户的个人数据，包括他们的IP地址，试图查出他们是否与涉嫌泄露机密信息的员工处于同一地点。\n\r\n\r\n《福布斯》报道称，字节跳动计划使用TikTok应用程序跟踪美国一些用户的具体位置后，该公司进行了第二轮调查，并发现有员工不当访问了个人用户数据。\n\r\n\r\n公司内部对事件进行调查，调查小组的一人辞职，三人被解雇。调查小组也被重组以避免日后再发生此类违规事件。\n\r\n\r\nTikTok首席执行官周受资在备忘录中称，这种不当行为完全不能代表公司的原则，虽然只是一小部分人，但是他对这些人容忍这种行为感到失望。他说，公司 “将继续加强这些访问权限。自这一举措发生以来，这些权限已得到了显著的改善和加强。”\n\r\n\r\n目前，TikTok在华盛顿面临来自立法者和拜登政府对美国用户数据安全问题的压力。\n\r\n\r\n另据彭博社报道，美国参议院情报委员会主席沃纳（Mark Warner）表明，如果拜登政府不能很快就保护美国用户数据安全推进解决方案，国会和各州可能很快会采取进一步措施来限制TikTok。沃纳说，他担心的主要有两个层面，一是保护美国用户数据，二是字节跳动可能会调整算法来配合共产党对台湾和其他问题的宣传。\n\r\n\r\n字节跳动首席执行官梁汝波在另一封给员工的信中表示，少数个人的不当行为会对公司花了很大努力建立的公众信任造成严重削弱，公司将努力修复这方面的损害，做一个得到公众信任的企业。\n\r\n\r\n稿源：联合早报",

          "description": "理中客，即理性、中立、客观三者的缩略词，是一套价值观念。理性中立客观是指在讨论或分析问题时，尽可能地摒弃个人情绪、偏见和价值观，从事实和逻辑的角度来看待问题。这样做的目的是为了尽可能地接近真相，使得讨论和分析的结论更加可信和有价值。\n\r\n\r\n要做到理性中立客观，需要遵循一些原则和步骤：\n\r\n\r\n1、信息自由\n\r\n\r\n信息自由是指人们能够自由获取和表达信息的权利。其中最基本的是获取全面的信息。获取全面的信息对于理性中立客观地讨论和分析问题非常重要。要想获取全面的信息，信息渠道需要多样化，能够做到从多个不同来源渠道获取信息，包括不同的媒体、研究论文、专家和相关人员的意见等，这样才能全面而准确地获取足够多的信息。\n\r\n\r\n信息自由可以影响人们的判断力。当人们接触到大量的信息时，他们可能会受到许多不同的观点的影响，如果信息不准确或不完整，这也可能会影响人们的判断力。如果人们基于错误的信息做出决定，那么这些决定很可能是不正确的。因此，在做出决策时，人们应该尽量确保拥有准确和完整的信息。\n\r\n\r\n2、独立思考\n\r\n\r\n独立思考是指不受他人的影响或偏见，能够独立地思考和分析问题的能力。基于独立思考的原则下进行的信息判断，往往可以做出理性中立的决策和判断。\n\r\n\r\n评估信息前，可以先对不同的观点进行比较，尽量了解各种各样不同的观点，并尝试将它们进行比较，以便更好地理解问题。了解一些专业人士以及相关人员的观点和看法，以便获取更为专业的意见。\n\r\n\r\n通过独立思考，根据自己所获得的信息，辨别信息的真伪，过滤偏见信息和假信息，运用逻辑和分析能力，基于全面而准确的信息做出明智的决策和判断。\n\r\n\r\n3、不断提升判断力\n\r\n\r\n判断力是指根据事实、信息和逻辑，做出正确的决策或解决问题的能力。\n\r\n\r\n通过广泛学习各种专业知识，可以丰富自己的知识和经验，为判断力的提升打下基础。活到老学到老，只有掌握足够多的知识，才能有效地对信息进行评估和判断。\n\r\n\r\n要掌握科学的态度和方法，科学是一个建立在可检验的解释和对客观事物的形式、组织等进行预测的有序知识系统，是已系统化和公式化了的知识。\n\r\n\r\n卡尔·波普尔认为，科学的本质是“可证伪性”，所有科学理论都有可证伪性，不可证伪的理论不是科学理论。可证伪性，是指“可以被证明是错的”，科学的理论一般都是“可证伪、且未被证伪”的。\n\r\n\r\n使用科学的方法，进行逻辑思维，要尝试对自己的判断进行反思，看看是否存在偏见或不合理的想法，并尝试修正这些想法，这样才能不断提升自己的判断力。\n\r\n\r\n4、良好的心态\n\r\n\r\n良好的心态能够帮助我们更好地面对困难和挑战、做出合理的决策，一些常见的良好心态包括：\n\r\n\r\n保持对事不对人的态度，在讨论或分析问题时，尽量摒弃个人情绪，尊重他人，即使你不同意他们的观点。要关注事实，并以事实为基础来进行分析和讨论。\n\r\n\r\n要有同理心，尝试理解他人的立场，并在讨论中尊重他人的意见。\n\r\n\r\n要尊重不同意见，即使你不同意他们的观点。不要轻易放弃自己的观点，也不要试图强迫别人接受自己的观点。\n\r\n\r\n总的来说，能够做到上面几点的话，就基本上能做到“理中客”了，通过这些原则，可以帮助我们保持客观中立的态度，使得讨论和分析更加公正和有价值。",

          "description": "常用的镇痛退烧药有乙酰氨基酚、布洛芬、阿司匹林等。这类药物的原理主要是通过抑制环氧化酶来减少中枢前列腺素的合成，通过下丘脑体温调节中心，导致外周血管扩张、出汗而达到退热的作用。\n\r\n\r\n当前感冒退烧药短缺，导致人们纷纷抢购囤药，因为乙酰氨基酚、布洛芬是许多人在发烧时使用的常见药物，缺货会导致许多人无法获得所需的药物治疗。\n\r\n\r\n我一般家里会定期备用一些感冒退烧药， 实际上如果对新闻和政策敏感的话，上个月就该囤药了。\n\r\n\r\n大部分人政策敏感度不够，我在二十条发布、股市上涨、富士康事件、石家庄放开封控、乌鲁木齐解封等等事件，就看出政策已经转向，于是我在11月26日就出去购买感冒退烧药，如酚咖片（含对乙酰氨基酚+咖啡因）、布洛芬，用来备用，当时购买感冒药还必须24小时绿码，测体温，视频备案，APP登记，我当时还在想为什么要登记这么多信息，事后就明白原因了。\n\r\n\r\n在我购买完感冒药之后的两天时间里，市政府（疫情防控指挥部）就连发四条警告短信，要我不要四处乱动，否则将承担法律责任，最可气的是，之后又有一个自称网格员的陌生人打我电话，问我最近购买的感冒药有没有服用，结果被我一顿臭骂。\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n如果上面这些还算是个人猜测的话，那么11月28日美国驻华使馆的声明就是确认无疑了。美国驻中国大使馆在11月28日发布声明中强调“我们鼓励所有美国公民，为您自己和您的所有家庭成员备妥14天的药物、瓶装水和食物供应。”\n\r\n\r\n在这份声明里，内容虽然说的隐讳，但在屯积的物品里面，药物被放在第一位，说明未来药物会非常紧缺，这时候再不去买药，就只能说明对新闻政策敏感性太低了，等到现在这个时间点，感冒退烧药出现挤兑，很可能需要用药的人却购买不到退烧药。\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n当然，实在没有退烧药的话，还可以进行物理退烧，常见的方法有：\n\r\n\r\n1、多喝水：少量多次饮用温开水，不仅可以补充液体，还可以加快排汗、排尿，促进体内的毒素及代谢废物排出；\n\r\n\r\n2、酒精擦拭法：酒精一般以30%-50%浓度为宜。酒精不要太凉，温度以32℃-35℃为宜。用纱布或毛巾浸蘸酒精后，有规律地擦拭大动脉等区域，例如颈部、腋窝、手臂等。\n\r\n\r\n3、冰袋冷敷法：将适量冰块放入冰袋中，再加入适量水，外面包裹上一层毛巾，放置在患者的前额15分钟即可；\n\r\n\r\n4、毛巾湿敷法：将浸湿冷水的毛巾拧成半干，敷在患者的前额或腋窝、腹股沟等大血管部位，达到降温目的。",
