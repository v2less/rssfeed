          "description": "I wrote this tool during an internship at Narf Industries in 2023. It's a REPL that allows for quickly developing, testing, and fuzzing for HTTP request smuggling attack payloads.\nI started the internship having never worked with web servers, and have now found over 100 HTTP implementation bugs. I attribute this mostly to the ease of experimentation in the Garden. REPL-oriented fuzzing is just a really good interface for finding parsing bugs. It's pretty neat to able to run a differential fuzzer, categorize and display all the discovered discrepancies, then let a human pick through them and interact with fuzz targets to test whether the bugs are exploitable.\nSome notable server combinations in which we discovered new request smuggling attacks include Google Cloud  Node.js, Akamai  Node.js, [almost anything]  LiteSpeed, and OpenBSD relayd  [anything].\nWe also found an infinite loop DoS in Cesanta Mongoose that affects all configurations, and a null pointer dereference that can crash any OpenBSD httpd server that uses FastCGI.\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39266112\nPoints: 44\n# Comments: 3",

Here is a quick demo: https://youtu.be/7-Q0XVpfW3Y\nCould you imagine the pain of building an entire software product using only assembly code? That’s about how we felt designing hardware. We don’t currently have good ways to describe what we need, reuse existing designs and compile that description down to a product.\nWe started atopile to fix this. atopile is an open-source language and toolchain to describe circuits with code. The compiler is here: https://github.com/atopile/atopile Docs are here: https://atopile.io/getting-started/ .

          "description": "I'm experimenting game mechanics that are usually seen on a typical grid, but transposed on an irregular one.\nThis is a first game based on Minesweeper.\nThe changes an irregular grid brings are that cells don't all have 8 neighbors. Some can have less, some can have more. So when you try and deduce if a tile has a mine, you have to pay closer attention at the number clues and which tiles neighbors it.\nMy intention is to make a very classic game a bit more challenging & fun.\nI've also released a first version of Checkers/Draughts, and plan to test similar variants for Chess, Othello and Go.\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39232572\nPoints: 130\n# Comments: 82",

          "description": "Hey everyone,\nML Blocks is a node-based workflow builder to create multi-modal AI workflows without writing any code.\nYou connect blocks that call various visual models like GPT4v, Segment Anything, Dino etc. along with basic image processing blocks like resize, invert color, blur, crop, and several others.\nThe idea is to make it easier to deploy multi-step image processing workflows, without needing to spin up endless custom OpenCV cloud functions to glue together AI models. Usually, even if you're using cloud inference servers like Replicate, you still need to write your own image processing code to pre and post-process images in your pipeline. When you're trying to move fast, that's just unnecessary overhead.\nWith ML Blocks, you can build a workflow and deploy the whole thing as a single API. AFAIK, ML Blocks is the only end-to-end workflow builder built specifically for image processing.\nIf you're curious, our models run on Replicate, HuggingFace & Modal Labs cloud GPUs and we use React Flow for the node UX.\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39217550\nPoints: 78\n# Comments: 29",

          "description": "Ubicloud is an open source cloud. Think of it as an open alternative to cloud providers, like what Linux is to proprietary operating systems. You can self-host Ubicloud or use our managed service.\nOur first use-case is GitHub Actions. We support x64 and arm64 Linux runners; and reduce your Github Actions bill by 10x. We can give you hardware similar to default GitHub runners because of the very high margins on the cloud. One difference with our hardware is that we use local NVMes for better disk performance.\nUbicloud and our GitHub Actions integration is also open source. You can check out our integration here: https://github.com/ubicloud/ubicloud/blob/main/routes/web/we...\nFor security and isolation, we give you a clean and ephemeral VM for each job. When the job completes, we deprovision the VM and wipe out the block storage device attached to the VM. We set up your firewall rules to lock down access to the VM; and also encrypt your data at rest and in-transit.\n(We use Linux KVM and the Cloud Hypervisor as our underlying VM tech. For our block device, we use and extend SPDK:  https://www.ubicloud.com/blog/building-block-storage-for-clo...)\nUbicloud runners are also fully compatible with GitHub runners. To get started, all you need to do is change 1-line in your workflow file. Each account gets 1,250 free build minutes per month with standard-2 runners.\nWe’d love to hear your feedback!\nhttps://www.ubicloud.com/docs/github-actions-integration/qui...\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39191870\nPoints: 363\n# Comments: 88",

Now they are even on reputable ones.\nIs this related to a decrease in Google’s payment to site owners? \nCan they choose to enable it or opt-out?\nIf you told me the small, tasteful, text-only Google Ads of the early 2000s would morph into something that obscures the entire page while still dominating the ad market, I’d call you crazy.\nTogether with the pricing increase of Google Workspace, (doubling in just one year, in my case), drastic reducing the reCAPTCHA free limit, etc, it seems reasonable to me to assume that Google’s profit are declining to an unsustainable degree.

Admin/owner is nearly / absolutely unreachable, which causes a variety of issues. Mainly we cannot even request a traditional backup of the database underneath the forum software.\n2. As with anything, the forums don't get much active engagement other than older forum regulars. However, Google searches easily find useful posts for things like DIY maintenance, modification installs, test data from driving with ECU tunes, track day experiences, etc.\n3. It's easy to point people on other social networks at posts by their URL, but due to neglect the website constantly has problems making access increasingly complicated and inconsistent.\nIdeally, it'd be nice to find a way to scrape everything as closely as possible into a manageable database.\nEven more ideally, if we could convert said scraped data into a format that is easily publishable to a new platform, that would be handy. Even if the new platform is static and simply renders the old threads.\nI can't imagine we are the only forum that is experiencing problems like this with most forums probably dying in the last decade.\nHas anyone gone through this kind of archival process with vBulletin before?\nThanks.\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39182738\nPoints: 45\n# Comments: 37",

You can try out some games over at https://boardzilla.io, or you can take a look at https://docs.boardzilla.io to learn more about how to develop your own game. Source is available at https://github.com/boardzilla\nHey y’all. My brother and I have made a framework for board games. During the pandemic we started to look at BGA but got discouraged by how old-fashioned the tools were and how cumbersome the development process was. We set out to make our own framework where you could use the same code for both the client and server. Our hope is anyone familiar with Typescript and CSS could code up a game without worrying about state management, persistence or networking.\nIt’s still very much a wip, and we're rapidly adding features and games. But we’ve got our first draft of developer docs done, and we've put up a few games we've developed to showcase and test out the platform. Source for the games and framework is available on Github, and we’re excited to code more games and hopefully encourage other people to try it out.

          "description": "Throwaway account to cover my tracks a bit.\nI'm a volunteer for a non profit that works with mental health as part of a ragtag bunch of men who have been affected by mental health. I'm also a solo entrepreneur with a very 'get shit done' mentality in my own world. The latter doesn't always mesh well with the former, and it's causing me some frustation with how long things take to get done.\nI report to a board of directors who aren't business owners, and they regard our organisation almost as a good cause whereas in reality it's a small business. There are donors (investors), customers (attendees) and staff (volunteers).\nWithout going into too many details, I've had to step back from some internal tasks since I was compensating for a director's lack of action / insight. I've done this for my own wellbeing, but I know ultimately sometimes things need to break before they come to light, and then they can be fixed.\nI have no desire to cover for the ineffective director, and I'd like to avoid a personality conflict with them. I can split the person from the tasks (or lack of action / insight on the tasks), so I don't see any vendetta on the horizon, but I'm struggling with lack of practical experience here since I've been solo since 2006.\nHow do you deal with superiors at your organisation that appear to be without direction, strategy, awareness and action?\nThank you.\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39148577\nPoints: 26\n# Comments: 19",

I guess the cynic in me expects that companies want you to use whatever OS is bundled with the hardware rather than encouraging users to use the hardware the way they'd like -- or at least that they wouldn't want to make it easy to overwrite the ChromeOS install by providing a helpful how-to!\nCan anyone think of why Lenovo would do this? I would expect that this would potentially draw the ire of Google, but surely Lenovo has thought this through and maybe knows Google doesn't care enough? Just curious if anyone can speak to Lenovo's incentive calculus here\nhttps://www.lenovo.com/us/en/faqs/operating-systems/install-linux-chromebook/\n(Ps: the guide is somewhat out of date -- for those curious, this seems the way forward for Chromebook users looking to install a Linux distro of their choosing https://docs.chrultrabook.com/\nSeems the galliumos project mentioned in the Lenovo link is now discontinued)\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39137451\nPoints: 10\n# Comments: 3",

          "description": "Hey HN,\nWe just shipped a new AI-powered feature... BUT the \"AI\" piece is largely in the background. Instead of relying on a chatbot, we've integrated AI (with strict input & output guardrails) into a workflow to handle two specific tasks that would be difficult for traditional programming:\n1. Identifying the most relevant base URL from HAR files, since it would be tedious to cover every edge case or scenario to omit analytics, tracking, and other network noise.\n2. Generating synthetic data for API requests by passing the API context and faker-js functions to GPT-4.\nThe steps are broken down into a simple flow, with users working with the AI and verifying the output throughout.\nAll of the focus is on reducing cognitive load and speeding up test generation.\nLet me know what you think!\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39046844\nPoints: 31\n# Comments: 9",

          "description": "I'm in the same hole as a ton of other people in Canada and the U.S, such that I'm unemployed and prospects are nil. What I'm seeing is that most companies, if they have any postings, have chosen to only advertise positions for people who are comically well-decorated; Principal engineers with 10 years of experience, plus the masters degree, plus a bunch of specific cloud orchestration, scalable systems, or other devops experience that just seems entirely impractical to accumulate without simply advancing at the same company or FAANG for 15 years, which seems itself to be an unachievable tenure in this millennium.\nI've been some kind of software developer for nearly 10 years, not all in a professional capacity and I don't claim that, but I'm not qualified for these positions; I just don't really have any other option but to chance it.\nMy question is, are qualified people actually hired through this channel, or are these postings just a formality so they can bypass some bureaucratic requirement?\nEdit: Is it worth spending the time on a decent cover letter that indicates I'd be interested in discussing a lower seniority position if they don't consider me qualified for the Staff or higher? Also, this isn't relegated to startup land, more traditional online retailers, and others who's core competency isn't necessarily software\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39007740\nPoints: 5\n# Comments: 1",

          "description": "Hey HN! Wanted to share a new library and server I've recently been working on called remoteStorage.\nWhen building frontends with Javascript, the native localStorage API is super useful for keeping track of state between sessions in the same browser, but it's not as good a solution when your data needs to be shared across multiple devices or browsers.\nFor instance, let's say you want to show a welcome modal to all new users that sign up for your product. If you use localStorage to track if a user has already seen this modal, your users will end up getting the experience repeatedly every time they switch devices or browsers, or whenever Chrome decides to nuke your data.\nI built remoteStorage to help fix that. Using the same API as localStorage, remoteStorage allows you to easily read and wr…",

We’re excited to share marimo, an open-source reactive notebook for Python [1]. marimo aims to solve well-known problems with traditional notebooks [2]: marimo notebooks are reproducible (no hidden state), git-friendly (stored as Python files), executable as Python scripts, and deployable as web apps.\nGitHub repo: https://github.com/marimo-team/marimo\nIn marimo, a notebook’s code, outputs, and program state are always consistent. Run a cell and marimo reacts by automatically running the cells that reference its declared variables. Delete a cell and marimo scrubs its variables from program memory, eliminating hidden state.

          "description": "The “__counted_by” macro is based on “__attribute__” (https://medium.com/@boutnaru/the-attribute-keyword-2ee44f59ab25), it is defined as part of the “compiler_attributes.h” (https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v6.7/source/include/linux/compiler_attributes.h#L104). “__counted_by” is used on flexible array members, it gets as a argument the field name (in the holding structure) which holds the count of the elements in the flexible array (https://web.archive.org/web/20230928010656/https://reviews.llvm.org/D148381).\n Overall, the information provided by “__counted_by” is used for array bounds sanitizers (for security reasons). This attribute is optional and relevant when using gcc >= 14 (https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v6.7/source/include/linux/compiler_attributes.h#L98) or clang >=18 (https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v6.7/source/include/linux/compiler_attributes.h#L99).\n Lastly, “__counted_by” is used by different data structures related like hardware drivers (NICs, SOCs, USB, GPU, sound, storage devices and more) and security components across the Linux kernel code (https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v6.7/A/ident/__counted_by). One example is Marvell’s NAND chip controller driver — as shown in the code snippet below.\n ​\n https://preview.redd.it/ljo0a3xljtgc1.png?width=828&format=png&auto=webp&s=b1f847be5a2d0e26d2cfe64590ad599858b571a0\n    submitted by    /u/boutnaru  \n [link]   [comments]",

At the very least you don't have to worry about tweaking your hardware or your Linux install. Just start and go.\n Just for fun I asked some eBay sellers some questions about their PCs.

I know this means nothing statisticaly, and I cant say its for sure what is happening all arround, but I think the conditions we are facing today may be pushing many people to Linux here.Our acess on computers is much different than you guys on the north. They are expensive, most people cant afford one, and when they do, they buy it for using forever. They dont have the money to buy another one when Microsoft decides to update windows and make it unusable on their devices, or when it gets too bloated and need more resources. The avarage laptop here has 4gb of ram and intel celerons, windows 10 and 11 does not run smoothly (and windows 11 wont run at all with that ultra specific hardware requirements).Many people are downgrading for Windows 7 because of this, even with no security updates, because it run better on these devices. But many people are giving Linux a try for the same reason.I see many people say \"This still is not the year for Linux\". Maybe it isnt. But it is the year of the beggining of downfall of Windows here on the periphery of capitalism at least.Also, the Linux desktop experience evolved A LOT in recent years, we have many resources and facitilations that did not exist before, and we have many user friendly Desktop Enviroments that make people what come from windows confortable.

The OS feels rock solid and not at all easy to break. \n Also I read Slackware 15.1 will drop LILO/ELILO for GRUB as the default boot loader. \n Basically, even if you don’t want to use slackbuilds and compile stuff, the distro has you covered. You literally just have to optionally change the system language, add a regular user and edit the inittab file to start KDE on boot… that’s it… simple and easy. There’s nothing else you need to do.\n Also I believe the stability and solidness comes from the distribution’s simplicity, as among other things, it still uses SysVInit.\n    submitted by    /u/SerenityEnforcer  \n [link]   [comments]",

I have a full AMD desktop station that I use for work, gaming and some ML experimentation, and I can't remember and iteration when I did spend 2 consecutive days without crashing. Mostly around AMDGPU.\n I suspend / resume a lot because my boot sequence is kind of long and I appreciate getting the PC to a usable state in a few seconds. The system would crash coming back from sleep or during any involved GPU task after coming back from sleep. \n Even with REISUB, since Wayland (KDE), it seems like it's mostly impossible to gain back a TTY during such a freeze. It used to work but it just never does these days, even when I can see in the logs that in fact, my emergency syncs & unmounts were working.\n All in all, whenever suspend-to-ram was involved, the graphic stack appeared to be made of script-kiddie C99 shellcode scripts stacked together in a trench-coat. Even during kernel 6.5.x, things weren't particularly great.\n However, ever since 6.6.10, things have been FANTASTIC! \n I've now spent around 15 days suspending/resuming each day, with more or less long gaming sessions, ML experimentation sessions and various stuff that I know usually can crash AMDGPU (screenshare on Wayland via the browser), and the system is still rocking solid.\n So my question is: to you fellow RDNA2/3 users that have experienced such problems, how is 6.7.x treating you? Is it as stable as the final 6.6.x series?\n    submitted by    /u/DarkeoX  \n [link]   [comments]",

So, because of the GPL... license, does this have to provide the source code to customers who use it for free? Does it provide if they have to provide?\n 2-What information about RHEL do Almalinux and rocky linux have access to? Do they have access to the source code of RHEL?\n First I understood it like this: RHEL provides source code to paid customers, but if you distribute it, it will terminate your contract. And you can't see source code of new updates. But if free accounts can see the source code, can't they constantly open new fake accounts and get the code to compile and distribute? What prevents this?\n Or are they reverse engineering?\n I searched on the internet but I couldn't understand it clearly.

I can't be arsed moving the Terminal around with other app windows all the time. Don't get me wrong, window snapping and Workspaces are great but I just want the Terminal to be bottom center, all the time, every time.\n So, any leads on an extension (or something) that can achieve this?\n Thanks all!\n ​\n UPDATE: I got the toggle from the Dock icon working using the Dash-to-Dock extension:\n  \ngsettings set org.gnome.shell.extensions.dash-to-dock click-action 'minimize'\n  \nAlso, smooth brain moment, I can just hit Super+1 to maximise, focus or minimise the terminal due to the Dock shortcut being there!\n Now I just need to find a way to have the window size and position be permanent!\n ​\n ​\n Here are some images to illustrate what I mean:\n Collapsed, no Terminal showing\n Expanded, Terminal showing\n    submitted by    /u/minmidmax  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "The “__visable” macro is based on “__atribute__” (https://medium.com/@boutnaru/the-attribute-keyword-2ee44f59ab25), it is defined as part of the “compiler_attributes.h” — as shown in the code snippet below (https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v6.7/source/include/linux/compiler_attributes.h#L162). The goal of “__visable” is to allow an object (variable/function) to remain visible outside the current compilation unit (https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/Common-Function-Attributes.html#index-externally_005fvisible-function-attribute).\n Overall, we can say that “__visable” nullifies gcc’s command line option “-fwhole-program”. This option is part of the optimization mechanism of gcc, it assumes the current compilation unit represents the whole program being compiled. Thus, all public variable/functions (excluding “main” and those marked “__visable”) become static functions and lead to a more aggressive interprocedural optimization (https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/Optimize-Options.html).\n Lastly, “__visable__” is supported only by gcc and not by clang, thus we can look at it as optional (https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v6.7/source/include/linux/compiler_attributes.h#L157). We can check out all the references of “__visable” as for kernel version 6.7 for more insights (https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v6.7/C/ident/__visible).\n ​\n https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v6.7/source/include/linux/compiler_attributes.h#L162\n    submitted by    /u/boutnaru  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "So, I was watching YouTube and this video about an abandoned Linux Desktop Environment called XPde caught my attention. From what is shown in the video, it's a pixel perfect copy of Windows XP. I couldn't manage to get V0.4 to run on either Debian 12 or Linux Lite, but I did manage to get V0.5.1 to run and it was buggy as hell. As I already mentioned before, the project was abandoned and never left the alpha stage but I feel like it would be awesome if someone forked and made this project usable. I would love to work on this project but I simply don't have the time and know-how to do so. \n Here's the GitHub Repository of the new version: https://github.com/Danct12/xpde\n I found the older and according to the author of the video more usable version (and the source code) on his website: http://retrotechlounge.com/linux_utils\n I hope this project gains more attention and turns into something more usable.\n    submitted by    /u/DavitSensei  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "In general, zombie processes (aka defunct processes) are processes which have finished their execution flow but still have an entry in the overall processes table. This phenomena happens due to the fact that the parent process has not read the child’s exit status. Zombie processes don’t require additional resources, however the existence of them can clutter the process table (https://ioflood.com/blog/ps-linux-command/).\n Moreover, in case we have zombie processes we can’t send them a “SIGKILL”, thus we need to signal the parent process to read the child process exit status. If we use “ps” zombie processes are marked as “<defunct>” and in the state column (“STAT or “S” header) the are denoted using “Z” (https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/ps.1.html). Also, in the top command there is a specific counter for zombie processes (https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/top.1.html) — as shown in the screen below (https://www.linuxfordevices.com/tutorials/linux/defunct-zombie-process).\n Lastly, the zombie state is saved as part of the the “exit_state” field (https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v6.6.8/source/include/linux/sched.h#L879) of the process’ “struct task_struct” (https://medium.com/@boutnaru/linux-kernel-task-struct-829f51d97275) structure. It is done using the “EXIT_ZOMBIE” define value (https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v6.6.8/source/include/linux/sched.h#L93).\n ​\n https://www.linuxfordevices.com/tutorials/linux/defunct-zombie-process\n    submitted by    /u/boutnaru  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "“cpp” is a symbolic link to an ELF file which is the C preprocessor. It is mostly located at “/bin/cpp” or “/usr/bin/cpp”. In some distributions like Ubuntu “/bin” is a symbolic link to “/usr/bin”. “cpp” is a macro processor that is used by the compiler in order to transform our code before compilation. In general, macros are abbreviations for longer contracts. We use it when writing code in C/C++/Objective-C (https://linux.die.net/man/1/cpp).\n Moreover, the macros’ transformations can be the inclusion of header files, macro expansions and more. Header files are included using “#include” while defining a macro is done using “#define”. Also, we can use the preprocessor to instruct whether to include/or not a block of code as part of the compilation phase (https://www.programiz.com/c-programming/c-preprocessor-macros). This is do using “ifdef”, “#ifndef”,”#define”,”#else” and “#endif” (https://www.cprogramming.com/reference/preprocessor/ifndef.html).\n Lastly, we can say that the preprocessor prepares the source code for the compilation phase by performing different transformations — as shown in the screenshot below (we can see the replacement of the macro name with a string and the removal of a function).\n ​\n https://preview.redd.it/65apnmnco1fc1.jpg?width=334&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f3df01403599aaa1a95edaf763ea97e15ceef11a\n    submitted by    /u/boutnaru  \n [link]   [comments]",

Here are my two cents in the hopes that it might be useful to someone.\n I installed MacOS High-Sierra 10.13.6 with my GTX1060. This specific version MACOS is the latest with NVIDIA drivers available. I tried installing MacOS 12.x Monterey and backporting the nvidia drivers with OCLP but I could not make it function properly.\n Some sources that I used to make this work:\n  \nMacOS on QEMU/KVM. You can install a MacOS vm using QEMU following the tools/instructions provided in this repo.\n When installing High-Sierra, I encountered a connection error during installation. In order to initialise the install I followed singleanswer's comment, found here.\n In order to make VFIO GPU PassThrough work, I highly recommend BlandManStudios's channel. Through his videos, I made a Win10 VM with GPU PassThrough. For the MacOS VM, I believe that only older NVIDIA GPUs are supported.\n Disable ROM BAR when adding the GPU PCI hardware with Virt-Manager. Having the option enabled halts the MacOS init process.\n  \nThis is a lot of hoops for just playing a videogame, I know. Riot's stance, forcing Vanguard onto users is frankly horrible and I understand peoples' sentiment in suggesting other games. Personally, my friends group meets in LoL for some casual ARAMs, and given that I do reside in a different country for studies, I would really like it if I could be part of this hang.\n ​\n EDIT: Spelling + add ROM BAR info\n    submitted by    /u/Defykouren  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hello,\n I am looking for GNU Linux community in the context of Farsi/Persian language. To my (Wikipedia-)knowledge most of them are related to the country Iran.\n I have problems to find them.\n Mailing lists at Debian/Ubuntu/Arch are dead. Linux distros related to Iran are inactive. I am not aware of active Linux user groups. Web foren are not accessible by me because I can't read Farsi.\n I need that contact to find Farsi translators for an open source project I am involved in with maintaining. To my experience with the 44 other foreign languages that application offers contacting the user communities is very helpful. Contacting the localization teams often doesn't help that much because these people are professionals still involved in localization projects. But I also tried this.\n If you understand Farsi I would be glad if we could get in contact and you might be able to redirect my concrete request for translations into thous communities. Or you can point me to this communities (mailing lists, web forums, ...).\n Thanks in advance\n Christian\n PS: I tried the related sub-reddits.\n    submitted by    /u/buhtz  \n [link]   [comments]",

Also if you want to contribute please do. I created a script to automate setting up a Minecraft server on Ubuntu Server 22.04. As a YouTuber, I made a video last year about manually installing a Minecraft server, which got a pretty good response. However, I noticed some viewers found the manual process a bit tricky. So, I thought, why not make it easier for everyone?\n My script handles everything from installing Java and opening necessary ports to downloading the Minecraft server JAR file and setting up a systemd service for easy management. Plus, it lets you choose between different server types like Paper, Purpur, or Vanilla!\n If you're into Linux and Minecraft, I'd really appreciate it if you could check out my project on GitHub and give it a try. I'm looking for feedback, suggestions, or even contributions to make it better. Your input would be super helpful!\n GitHub link: https://github.com/keepittechie/mcsli\n Thanks a lot for your time, and I'm excited to hear what you think! 🙂\n    submitted by    /u/keepittechie  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hey people,\n I am thinking of making a distro for fun, complete with its own package manager and other bells and whistles, where it would be possible to have multiple binaries in a single installation.\n For example; one can boot from an x86 machine through EFI\\BOOT\\BOOTX64.EFI then later boot on an ARM machine through EFI\\BOOT\\BOOTAARCH64.EFI. The arch-specific initrd will symlink the executables in the booted architecture's binary directory to the PATH directories: /bin, /usr/bin, and /usr/local/bin, and do other arch-specific stuff whilst doing the regular booting stuff.\n Now, I've done some googling myself, but I couldn't really find anything about that kind of setup. What I'm reckoning about right now is figuring out the best place to put the architecture specific.\n Here are my ideas (optional arch-specific share directory in case someone decided to put arch-specific stuff in there for fun. not something one is supposed to do I know.):\n  \n/usr/{x86_64,aarch64,any}/{bin,lib,opt,share}\n /usr/archs/{x86_64,aarch64,any}/{bin,lib,opt,share}\n /usr/{bins,libs,opts,shares}/{x86_64,aarch64}\n and other variants of those.\n  \nLet me know what you guys reckon, suggest, or feel free to call the entire endeavour stupid!\n    submitted by    /u/striczkof  \n [link]   [comments]",

It's so nice to see a proper support for Linux on a mainstream laptop. And the update, I must add, was smooth as butter.\n I'm aware that ThinkPads have supported Linux before as well, but regular ThinkPads have Fn+LCtrl key order on left, and I just can't get used to it even if it is BIOS-configurable (Fn being smaller key).

          "description": "In the Linux kernel devices (character/block device) are represented as a pair of numbers (<major>:<minor>). There are some major/minor numbers which are reserved while others are assigned dynamically. A major number can be shared between multiple device drivers (https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/linux-on-systems?topic=hdaa-device-nodes-numbers).\n Overall, device files are located in “/dev” and they allow accessing the device from user-mode. Those files are “connected” to the device using the major and minor number — as shown in the diagram below on the left side (https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/linuxonibm/com.ibm.linux.z.ufdd/lxnode.jpg). We can see them using “ls -l” — as shown in the shell output in the screenshot below (taken from copy.sh). The major number identifies the drivers associated with the device, while the minor number is used only by the driver which gets the number without the kernel using it (https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/linux-device-drivers/0596000081/ch03s02.html).\n Moreover, the kernel code that can assign the name and the major number for a specific device char device can use the “register_chrdev” function (https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v6.6.1/source/include/linux/fs.h#L2535). In case of a block device can use the macro “register_blkdev” (https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v6.6.1/source/include/linux/blkdev.h#L809).\n Lastly, we can use the “mknod” (https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/mknod.1.html) command to create a block/char device file by providing a name, major and minor numbers. We can also list the major numbers of the currently registered devices with their names (https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man5/procfs.5.html) — as shown in the output of the screenshot below.\n ​\n https://preview.redd.it/mqtqjckva1ec1.png?width=1100&format=png&auto=webp&s=764928e9771903e257f0ece553f9ccbc9c021078\n    submitted by    /u/boutnaru  \n [link]   [comments]",

I understand the issues with video decoding, and having a closed source bootloader. But trivial stuff like device tree sources (e.g. BCM2710) have not been mainlined. In my experience it is more hassle in the medium term keeping your own patchset than upstreaming.\n Do you know a reason why this is the case?

Basically I just wandered around the OS and poked around in the menus.\n ​\n Over the years, I've learned to understand Windows better and better and today I have a good command of it. It does what I ask it to, I know how to get rid of unwanted elements as much as possible, etc.\n That said, I deeply disapprove of the way in which GAFAM conceives its relationship with its users and siphons off our personal data, etc. For these reasons, I try to avoid them as much as possible.\n But there's still that famous Windows. I like it in some ways, it's a matter of habit, and it's also how I learned to use a computer, to understand a whole lot of things. In fact, I recently became a computer technician.\n ​\n In short, I'd say that ideologically I'd like to switch to Linux. I'm not afraid of losing functionalities, I'm not afraid of not finding this or that software (or its alternative), I'm not afraid of learning how to use it (on the contrary, I find it motivating).\n ​\n My only fear is of gradually losing my few Windows skills. At work, all client workstations run Windows, and I wouldn't want to become a Windows illiterate over time.\n ​\n What do you think?\n    submitted by    /u/Plopaplopa  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "My understanding is that these are both supposed to be \"containerized\" and \"distro-agnostic\" package formats, but I just do not see the appeal of Flatpak when compared to Appimages.\n Appimages are the most like ordinary Windows .exe files, or MacOS .app files. They're literally just portable double-click-and-run applications, like applications should be. Just make it executable, drop them in ~/Applications, and make a link to it wherever. I understand that they haven't received the same amount of integration efforts as Flatpaks, so they can't as easily be added to your DE's dock or taskbar, but I wish they had.\n Flatpaks are kinda frustrating to me, since most of the time I only seem to get a .flatpakref file, which isn't even the package itself, and it installs like a .deb or .rpm. What's the point, other than for it to work across multiple distros? They also take FOREVER to install, it's always the most time-consuming part of setting up any new distro install. Also, they're often not just one flatpak package, which sort of defeats part of the point, doesn't it? AND they aren't all installed in the same locations, so it can be a bitch to find the directory it was installed to if I need to manually edit something.\n My biggest issue with Appimages is just that they're treated as a new process every single time, so they can repeatedly trigger security programs like OpenSnitch regardless of whether or not you've whitelisted them previously. You can work around that by setting a custom rule that catches all processes downstream of that package, so it's definitely possible to bake Appimage support into OpenSnitch, but if that's the worst I have to deal with, I'll still gladly take Appimages over Flatpaks any day.\n    submitted by    /u/Omnizoa  \n [link]   [comments]",

A two bytes per pixel saving where for general use its pretty hard to distinguish any difference. Times 1920 pixel width times 1080 depth times 60 frames/second ... and a sizeable difference in the amount of data that has to be conveyed/processed (moreso as I've also dropped the maximum frame rate down to 16 fps)\n For that I'm using the framebuffer, vesafb/fbcon, along with some framebuffer vnc viewer source code cobbled together. So for instance boot to framebuffer, load up a headless full desktop session that serves to vnc, and using framebuffer vnc viewer to connect/view/use that, more often from within the same laptop device, but as vnc is widespread can be a qemu or from remote systems (phone, server). That is working well, in fact really well .... except for the fbvnc viewer I'm using is lacking, some more obscure key combo's that simply don't work as intended. My question is that of the open source vnc viewers out there, how easy might it be to convert one of those to being framebuffer based? Or maybe one already caters for that? tigervnc server/viewer is my preferred choice when it comes to running under X as historically that has worked the best for me (uk keyboard layout) such that a vncviewer (client) running within framebuffer would be the ideal.\n    submitted by    /u/rufwoof  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "You've probably heard of 'Linux will be BIG in the future' yada yada for the last two decades and it obviously hasn't exactly manifested as such. Yet, I think as more and more time passes, Linux will slowly but surely become more and more widespread, moreso than most people think.\n Why?\n Well, Valve. Valve as a company essentially have heavily depended on Windows as their primary platform to distribute software (ie games on) which is fine, except that they are pretty much dependent on Microsoft. Now, Windows is going nowhere. If Microsoft is a beach full of sand, Valve is only a handful. But the one thing that Valve pretty much dominates is being the distributer for games. For Valve to not be dependent on Microsoft's software essentially means adopting open-source sofware aka Linux.\n Valve attempting to adopt Linux isn't anything new - we've had Steam Machines back in the day using Steam OS 2.0 (outdated now) and the early verisons of Proton compatibility layer which lets you play Windows DirectX games on Linux. But now with the Steam Deck being a relatively big success, more average users have actually used Linux and realised it's actually pretty cool.\n On the developer side of things, let's go back a decade - remember Mantle API? The API that was a 'miracle' compared to DX11? Well for those who don't know, that's now the Vulkan API which many games use and it works with Linux i.e. more and more games can actually be 'easily' compiled for Linux. This + Proton = very good game compability on Linux.\n These two things together might just give Linux the push it needs to be an actual alternatives people consider.\n Who knows, maybe in 5 years time, we will walk into an electronics store and see a bunch of Windows laptops, MacBooks, and a wide variety of Linux machines as well.\n    submitted by    /u/Pythagosaurus69  \n [link]   [comments]",

While the technology evolves, a familiar feeling returns – a subtle unease about control and ownership of our machines. This disquiet echoes an undercurrent of the early internet, where software giants first experimented with closed systems and recurring fees. \n Remember CompuServe and AOL? Their pretty sandboxes, promising convenience, ultimately felt stifling for anyone who felt like they could get more from their computers.

The hardware category stagnated, after Microsoft realized they suck at empowering touch-centric workflows.\n This changed with Windows 10, which walked back Windows 8 touch-centric menus and gradually re-integrated touch-friendly UI with 11. This is likely to continue development, in light of the recent Consumer Electronics Show (CES).\n This year of CES in particular is relevant. Products like the Zenbook DUO laptop with keyboard, dual screen, desktop mode, and sharing mode will encourage Microsoft to continue enhancing the touch-based experience.\n The potential for SnapdragonX chips and ARM CPUs to run Android apps natively is significant.…",

Sometimes however, an update requires a restart due to a kernel update. Sometimes you can't do a restart just yet - eg if you have some critical software/site running that requires no downtime.\n If you've ever ssh'd into your server and see a message that your machine requires a restart - an unapplied kernel update might be the reason.\n I'm not sure if this is common knowledge, but after diving into this I found out that the kernel has a live patching feature, where you can apply the updated kernel without any downtime on a live system - pretty neat!\n I wrote a rough overview of this tech here. You might not need this knowledge often - but it's still very nice to know that such a cool feature exists in situations that require it!\n    submitted by    /u/waterslurpingnoises  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I know a lot of people mock or make fun of phrases like \"This is the year of Linux\" or \"2024 is the year of Linux\", but I literally think that the 2020s IS the decade of Linux, and here's why: Gaming.\n Let's be honest, if you're not using a computer for work, archiving, developing, or passion projects, you're using a computer for entertainment. One of the most popular forms of entertainment is gaming.\n The efforts of Valve/Steam, the development of WINE, the community effort of making the desktop experience better, and making drivers better, we should be expecting a lot more Linux users down the line, possibly more than ever.\n With concepts, products, and changes such as:\n  \nSteamdeck\n Raspberry PI and retro gaming\n Companies creating a business out of selling retro gaming handhelds\n Most closed-source services are playing around with subscription models with their core OS or Office utilities and features (pushing users out for economic or personal reasons)\n A stronger drive for privacy\n  \nWe've ended 2023 with a 3.8% market share, the highest Linux has ever been. I expect this year to end with higher numbers.\n Linux has always needed a product that sells, in terms of easy to use, gaining a market of non-tech or computer market, and etc. The Steamdeck seems to be the best example of that concept.\n Most people might not realize that what they're gaming on runs on Linux, and that's fine. But I think Linux is on its way to become mainstream again, and can easily be in peoples' homes without them knowing it. The Linux experience is getting better, and upstart companies (especially in gaming) are definitely striking into this opportunity.\n    submitted by    /u/nPrevail  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Bottles is awesome! I've gotten to launch windows apps that I could never have before, whether it be via Lutris or anything else. It's super sleek, easy to use, gaming-ready and open source.\n Each program (or set of programs for that matter) has its own environment, just like Docker or regular Wineprefixes. Bottles makes it blissfully easy to install missing dependencies, manage runtime options, switch runner between different versions (Wine Upstream vs Proton vs anything really).\n I've gotten some truly indecently modded games to run without the hint of a problem using bottles. I've completely ditched Lutris or similar solutions in favor of Bottles. Sometimes Lutris install scripts aren't up to date, or a different setup with newer versions may work better. Using bottle, you can manually tweak everything. If I'm missing windows dependencies, I can just install them from bottles, it's automatic, it works. Switch the runner around to see if that game would run better (I strongly advise you download and use the latest caffe runner rather than the default soda runner), activate a few options to make the thing more snappy, boom, ready to go.\n I know Bottles didn't invent the concept of \"Wine Bottles\" but it makes a bliss to work with. This is probably one of the best apps a linux newbie coming from windows could ask for.\n What I love is the compartmentalization especially. When tinkering with a specific bottle, you can break everything and you risk no side effects on your other Wine apps, which wasn't the case from my experience. Furthermore, you can add multiple programs to the same bottle when it makes sense, and makes modding a whole lot easier.\n It even allows you to create desktop menu entries. I love Bottles!

          "description": "Hello all.\n I'm newer to seriously using Linux. Anytime Nvidia comes up, it seems like they get bombarded with hate. People act like Nvidia isn't even usable. I know that their drivers aren't open source, which to many is an objection.\n However, beyond that, everything does seem to just work for me. I did have some serious trouble getting wayland to start. But, once I got it to start it's actually really smooth. The only issue I've run into is Wayland not supporting E-sync yet. Which means that applications which don't run at the monitor's refresh rate have some artifacts. ( though, admittedly this is less of an issue for me since my GPU can run most things at my monitor's refresh rate.)\n Both AMD and Nvidia want Wayland to support E-sync. Nvidia devs are even contributing code to the Wayland project to make it happen. E-sync seems to be the path forward and the better way of doing things.\n So, why the Nvidia hate? Is it just the closed source drivers? Or did Nvidia used to be truly unusable as the loud haters seem to say it is? My experience ( Minus one hiccup. Getting Wayland to start) has been pretty positive overall. ( Though, my usecase can be different than many others. Which is why I'm making this post to learn.)\n    submitted by    /u/Clottersbur  \n [link]   [comments]",

The issue doesn't affect the mentioned software's Linux installers.\n So! I developed and published a software https://github.com/poetaman/arttime. Thinking it would be beneficial for users to be able to install it from homebrew, I published a package on that platform. Recently, I realized that there is problem. Unlike when a user runs install.sh from arttime's cloned GitHub repository, a user installing from homebrew doesn't get a crucial installation note. The note asks users to take a few steps before using the software, so it runs correctly at their end. The only installation message homebrew's installer print from developer is called \"caveats\".

          "description": "It came out couple of months ago , I've been using 23.04 for about half a year now (my first ever serious Linux installation on my personal laptop which has no Windows anymore, even if I got 11 with it) with great satisfaction. I did struggle the first day with my wifi but after fixing it, there have been no problems.\n Then there was some weird sound issue with MT32 emulation and DOSBox and generally playing two audio sources at the same time. After installing Pipewire and updating some packages, the problems went away.\n So quite soon support is going out for 23.04 and the update to 23.10 was warning me that it could take hours and rewrite thousands of packages. I was quite worried things may get back to square 1, and this time I may not be able to fix the audio and wifi.\n Very happy to say that the updater took only about 20 minutes, a single reboot and that was about it. For some reason, it now takes 4 GB of space less on my hard drive.\n I did have to re-install Wine, especially the 32bit stuff.. but that was all. Awesome, trouble free, seamless update of the whole system. I hope the LTS update goes the same, then I may stick with it for some time.. as some of the aps are not regularly updated for the new OS releases.\n Loving Linux more and more with each passing day as I am not hitting anywhere near the number of issues I thought I would be having... everything just works, even the old stuff through Wine.\n    submitted by    /u/BestRetroGames  \n [link]   [comments]",

I think that calls for a celebration 🎊.\n Anyway, since the previous version of this was removed by auto-mod for being too short here's the infamous GNU/Linux copy-pasta to pad it out:\n I'd just like to interject for a moment. What you're refering to as Linux, is in fact, GNU/Linux, or as I've recently taken to calling it, GNU plus Linux. Linux is not an operating system unto itself, but rather another free component of a fully functioning GNU system made useful by the GNU corelibs, shell utilities and vital system components comprising a full OS as defined by POSIX. Many computer users run a modified version of the GNU system every day, without realizing it. Through a peculiar turn of events, the version of GNU which is widely used today is often called Linux, and many of its users are not aware that it is basically the GNU system, developed by the GNU Project. There really is a Linux, and these people are using it, but it is just a part of the system they use. Linux is the kernel: the program in the system that allocates the machine's resources to the other programs that you run. The kernel is an essential part of an operating system, but useless by itself; it can only function in the context of a complete operating system. Linux is normally used in combination with the GNU operating system: the whole system is basically GNU with Linux added, or GNU/Linux. All the so-called Linux distributions are really distributions of GNU/Linux! \n Edit: 1,000,002 now we made it!\n    submitted by    /u/Salander27  \n [link]   [comments]",

There are a few scenarios where tertiary sources may provide some value over primary sources. For instance,\n  \nTertiary sources may provide more context for a particular piece of news\n Tertiary sources may take a complicated topic and make it easier to understand\n  \nFor example, a Phoronix article about bcachefs not making the merge window provides more context and is an easier read than a kernel.org email thread about it. Under the new rules, this sort of post would be allowed.\n However, tertiary sources covering This Week in Gnome or This Week in KDE would not be allowed because these are considered good primary sources.\n So the proposed change to rule 2 would be something like the following:\n  \nPosts should be submitted using the original source with the original title. Primary sources are heavily preferred, but tertiary sources that provide sufficient value over primary sources may be allowed. Tertiary sources that do not provide sufficient value will be removed and the original poster will be asked to repost using the primary source.

          "description": "1月25日，苹果公司官网宣布，为遵循欧盟《数字市场法案》（DMA），将在欧盟地区对iOS系统、Safari浏览器和App Store实施重大更新。\n\r\n\r\n具体来说，这次改革将首次允许客户从苹果应用商店以外下载软件。人们还将能够使用其他的支付系统，并且更容易地选择新的默认网络浏览器。此外，欧盟地区iOSApp将为开发者降低手续费（抽成比例），从原先的30%降至17%，或从折扣后的15%降至10%。而在降低手续费的基础上，苹果将额外收取支付处理使用费和核心技术使用费。\n\r\n\r\n欧盟用户可通过第三方下载应用\n\r\n\r\n30%的“苹果税”也下调了\n\r\n\r\n苹果此次改革中最受瞩目的无疑是将首次允许用户在不使用App Store的情况下将软件下载到iPhone上。不过苹果也强调，开放第三方应用商店，并不代表完全放弃安全，依然会把控应用分发，审查所有应用程序。\n\r\n\r\n在欧盟地区，苹果将推出新的控制选项，使用户能够选择默认使用第三方非接触支付app或替代app市场。不过对于使用替代支付处理方式的app，苹果无法提供退款，在顾客遭遇问题或欺诈时提供支持的能力也将受限。\n\r\n\r\niOS用户现在就可以将第三方网络浏览器（而非Safari浏览器）设为默认浏览器。按照《数字市场法》（DMA） 的规定，Apple 还将推出新的选择界面，用户在 iOS 17.4 或后续版本中首次打开 Safari 浏览器时将显示新的可选界面。这个界面将提示欧盟用户从选项列表中选择默认浏览器。\n\r\n\r\n此外，新的改革摒弃了自2008年苹果应用商店推出以来，苹果对开发者征收的最高30%佣金。现在他们在应用销售中仅需向苹果公司支付17%的佣金，并且在一年之后，对于大多数开发者和订阅者，佣金比例下降至10%。苹果公司未在欧盟以外的地区修改其佣金结构。\n\r\n\r\n不过需要注意的是，在降费的同时，苹果引入了两项额外的费用。一是对使用苹果内购系统的应用征收3%的支付处理费，二是对安装数超过100万次的软件，每个App应用征收0.50欧元的安装费，无论是通过苹果商店还是第三方安装，这个费用都适用。此举也意味着在苹果应用商店外销售的App应用不需要支付其他佣金，只需支付0.50欧元的费用。\n\r\n\r\n苹果也会向美国、日本低头？\n\r\n\r\n爱买苹果的中国市场“无福享受”\n\r\n\r\n据澎湃新闻，AppStore向来收取开发者销售额高达30％的手续费，成为公司软件服务业务的关键组成部分。根据瑞银集团此前的预测，AppStore贡献了苹果服务业务四分之一的营收；按照苹果去年11月公布的、截至2023年9月30日的2023财年第四财季业绩计算，服务业务季度营收213.5亿美元，意味着该季度AppStore获得的营收约为50亿美元。\n\r\n\r\n据财联社，此前，欧盟在2022年通过了《数字市场法》，旨在遏制科技公司的所谓反竞争行为。虽然《数字市场法》也适用于谷歌，但与苹果公司的iOS设备不同，谷歌的安卓系统手机允许用户在Google Play商店之外安装应用程序，因此谷歌本身已经符合上述法律的这一要素。\n\r\n\r\n这不是苹果公司第一次向欧盟妥协。据南方都市报，欧盟于2022年10月通过了一项法案，法案规定，欧盟区域内所有手机、平板电脑和相机的通用充电端口将自2024年12月开始采用通用的USB Type-C接口。2023年9月，苹果公司在新品发布会上已经宣布，iPhone15手机已全部改用USB Type-C接口。\n\r\n\r\n据新京报，欧盟区有了特供版应用商店后，消费电子领域的资深作家克里斯·史密斯评论称，欧盟可能是第一个对iPhone开放侧载的，但它不会是最后一个。日本和美国正在考虑类似的立法。“如果苹果正在准备的欧盟应用商店版本最终将在全球范围内推出，我不会感到惊讶。” 据媒体报道称，日本正在制定相关法规，要求苹果、谷歌等科技巨头允许第三方应用商店在其移动操作系统上进行支付，以遏制它们滥用其在日本市场的主导地位。\n\r\n\r\n不过中国区暂时不会出现类似情况。新京报记者询问中国区的苹果应用商店是否也有可能会开放，一位技术顾问回应称，目前不存在这种情况，“一切以官网为准。”值得注意的是，IDC最新数据显示，2023年苹果以17.3%的市场份额取代Vivo，首次成为国内市场全年出货量第一。\n\r\n\r\n来源：每日经济新闻综合自苹果公司官网、澎湃新闻、财联社、新京报、公开信息",
