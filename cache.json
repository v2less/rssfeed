          "description": "Hi HN\nA few folks and I have been working on this project for a couple weeks now. After previously working on the Docker project for a number of years (both on the container runtime and image registry side), the recent rise in open source language models made us think something similar needed to exist for large language models too.\nWhile not exactly the same as running linux containers, running LLMs shares quite a few of the same challenges. There are \"base layers\" (e.g. models like Llama 2), specific configuration to run correctly (parameters, temperature, context window sizes etc). There's also embeddings that a model can use at runtime to look up data – we don't support this yet but it's something we're looking at doing soon.\nIt's an early project, and there's still lots to do!\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36802582\nPoints: 142\n# Comments: 50",

          "description": "I quit my job last year and worked mostly on this full SwiftUI rewrite of my Japanese reading app, Manabi Reader. The rewrite gave me the opportunity to expand to macOS (and without Catalyst so it feels extra native) and redo the data layer to be offline-first via Realm with iCloud sync.\nThe biggest differentiators compared with other language study apps are that it tracks every word/kanji you read so that you can see how much of a given webpage/article you're already familiar with and other features/analytics built on that foundation; it automatically builds a personal corpus of example sentences; and that it does all the Japanese tokenization/dictionary lookups locally on-device and in a flexible web browser-like UI with readability mode, to be respectful of your privacy and to work offline.\nI've also added Anki integration. Tap a word, tap another button to save it to Anki with the original source material sentence and URL. I have a Manabi Flashcards app as well if you don't like Anki.\nPacked with free features. See what percent of each article's vocabulary you're familiar with based on your reading history. Scan paragraphs of text with your camera to look up words. Japanese/English dict. Native Japanese web dicts. Look up kanji by drawing. Expanded JLPT levels. RSS. Web browser UI. Save links from other apps. Works offline. Readability mode. Tap words to look them up. Furigana depending on your familiarity with each word.\nFuture plans: besides more features (ePUB, YouTube, mpv player, WaniKani integration, more languages, etc), I’m also preparing the underlying SwiftUI web browser lib as open source and will launch it as a WebKit-based browser/reader option, which I’m excited to get out alongside other interesting recent entrants to the desktop and mobile browser market.\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36674259\nPoints: 62\n# Comments: 30",

Beyond the code, there is likely some value in the extensive and largely complete implementation docs; basic benchmarks are linked in the README, too.\nKind of aiming to be \"the libavl for HAMTs\". That is obviously a high and aspirational bar but a distinct possibility if it stirs up a little interest and/or contribution.\nAnyways, it's time for this to go out, collect feedback and maybe even some use outside of toy projects.

          "description": "I always enjoy reading posts about indie game development and looking at the source code of games other people have built. So for any game I release I naturally I want to do the same.\nhttps://github.com/Mknsri/HockeySlam\nHockey Slam is a hockey shootout game on Android which I built almost from scratch. Some of the engine features include 3D graphics with PBR materials, a rudimentary physics system, replays, a multithreaded job system and a hot-reload DLL platform for developing on Windows.\nI detailed the creation of the game in it's own post, but now that time has passed I am releasing the source code and assets under the MIT license. You can still find the making of here: https://hockeyslam.com/makingof\nI'm happy to answer any questions you might have.\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36672183\nPoints: 46\n# Comments: 7",

          "description": "My friend and I have been feeling frustrated at how inefficient it is to find information at work. There are so many tools (Slack, Confluence, GitHub, Jira, Google Drive, etc.) and they provide different (often not great) ways to find information. We thought maybe LLMs could help, so over the last couple months we've been spending a bit of time on the side to build Danswer.\nIt is an open source, self-hosted search tool that allows you to ask questions and get answers across common workspace apps AND your personal documents (via file upload / web scraping)! Full demo here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geNzY1nbCnU&t=2s.\nThe code (https://github.com/danswer-ai/danswer) is open source and permissively licensed (MIT). If you want to try it out, you can set it up locally with just a couple of commands (more details in our docs - https://docs.danswer.dev/introduction). We hope that someone out there finds this useful\nWe’d love to hear from you in our Slack (https://join.slack.com/t/danswer/shared_invite/zt-1u3h3ke3b-...)  or Discord (https://discord.gg/TDJ59cGV2X). Let us know what other features would be useful for you!\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36667374\nPoints: 139\n# Comments: 51",

          "description": "There are existing HN job aggregators, but I thought we could take it a step further.\nInspired by an insightful comment on a previous thread (https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36163021), I built a tool that aggregates job postings and intelligently categorizes them based on user-specific preferences:\n* Country and remote work preferences\n* Employer type (e.g., startup, corporation, government)\n* Industry\n* Technologies used\n* Role type (developer, architect, product owner, etc.)\n* Salary range (where available)\nOne of the superpowers of LLMs is reformatting information from any format X to any other format Y.\nWe leverage this to map all the unstructured job postings into the same unified structure. The new GPT functions feature and the extended context windows are really helpful for this.\nInstead of having to build a custom NER pipeline, it works very well with GPT out-of-the box.\nOne challenge is keeping the filters consistent and merging of duplicates. Embeddings help with that.\nWhat's next:\n* Integrate additional sources. We can generate web scrapers and data processing steps on the fly that extract and transform data into the same structure.\n* Add location distance filters.\n* Expand beyond jobs to monitor personalized data like events or real estate. Imagine using AI to rate local events from multiple sources based on your preferences, considering factors like your interests and distance from home.\n* Smaller improvements based on your feedback :)\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36574090\nPoints: 58\n# Comments: 14",

With the death of Apollo also goes the metaphorical death of all the best parts (IMO) of the internet: open-source, creativity, entrepreneurial spirit. Sad day. I guess I’ll go outside now.\nEdit: sorry, Apollo wasn’t open source. That’s what happens when I make a post while two beers deep I guess.

          "description": "Hey guys,\nEndless is an open-source mobile app that curates posts from your favorite websites in one place with a common interface. The application uses custom extractors specifically written for each website. This way you can endlessly scroll through posts and save the ones you like without having to deal with ads.\nWith the Endless server I am hosting you can also upvote and leave comments on posts without creating an account! With random tokens linked to your actions you basically use your device as your account and undo your actions in the future without spoiling your identity.\nI hope to add more extractors in the future. Feel free to install the app and check out the extractors yourself or contribute to the project! I always love to hear your comments and feedback.\nGitHub: https://github.com/kaangiray26/endless\nAPK Releases: https://github.com/kaangiray26/endless/releases\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36496644\nPoints: 62\n# Comments: 24",

          "description": "I worked on a web service that allows you to import a song and define a target length that the song will be shortened or lengthened to. It does this by analyzing the song and finding repeating audio patterns. This is helpful for making any song match a video or performance with a set duration. You can also specify areas of the song to prefer or avoid. An example is available here: https://mofi.loud.red/edit/8bd3fdf780f8c3927e41029f3b957f8a7...\nThe cool thing is that after the song is analyzed on the server, the client can recompute and preview the results completely client-side through an implementation that uses Web Workers and WebAssembly. The audio previewing uses Tone.js. I am thinking of writing up some more details about the implementation in the future.\nI'm still working on a way to explain this easily, but I like the idea of carrying over the concept of content-aware fill from images to audio.\nPlease let me know if you have any comments or questions!\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36480687\nPoints: 410\n# Comments: 118",

          "description": "Hi HN, I recently created and published an open-source resume builder as a weekend project. The idea came to me while I was mentoring students and noticing common mistakes they made in their resumes that I had also made in the past. I thought to build a tool to help people easily create a modern professional resume with built-in best practices to avoid those mistakes.\nTop highlights of the resume builder are:\n1. Real time UI update as you type\n2. ATS friendly to top ATS platforms, e.g. Greenhouse, Lever\n3. Privacy focus - no sign up is required and data is stored locally in browser that only users have access\n4. Support import from existing resume PDF\nThe tool also includes a resume parser to help people test their existing resumes’ ATS readability if they might not be interested in using the builder. I also explained the parser algorithm in an article with interactive tables that might be an interesting read to see the steps and logics it uses (https://www.open-resume.com/resume-parser).\nI hope others might find this tool useful and I look forward to hearing any feedback the community has. Thanks all.\nHome Page: https://open-resume.com\nGithub Repo: https://github.com/xitanggg/open-resume\nProduct Hunt: https://producthunt.com/posts/openresume\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36470297\nPoints: 408\n# Comments: 135",

This'll be called the UHP Open Standard and will run on Windows, Mac and Linux. It'll also be built into Tectonic Marketplace, which will be a Chromium based app meant to allow the user to download and run UHPs. The user can also drag 3rd party UHP files into the app and install them. \n We need people that are familiar with: - the Chromium codebase (!!!) - GTK theming - making Debian applications - basic web development (HTML, CSS, JS)\n If you're interested, get in touch with me either here or on Discord. My username is @kantraa. We can discuss this further if you want and I will add you to our development group. This project is 100% non-profit, so because of that and other things right now there won't be any pay unfortunately.

It returns the output in a JSON format, thus enabling users to parse it according to their liking or forward it to any other tool for further processing.\n In short, BucketLoot has the following features: 1. Scan for secret exposures 2. Extract assets such as URLs, Subdomains and Domains 3. Search for custom keywords or regex queries \n The tool can help people like bug hunters and penetration testing folks to step up their recon game and go beyond the traditional tools available in the market.\n In case you would like to know more about BucketLoot, make sure to head over to our blog @ RedHunt Labs which gives a brief walkthrough of the tool: https://redhuntlabs.com/blog/introducing-bucketloot-an-automated-cloud-bucket-inspector/\n    submitted by    /u/0x9747  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "VFS (Virtual File System, aka Virtual File Switch) is a software component of Linux which is responsible for the filesystem interface exposed to user-mode applications. Using it allows the kernel to provide an abstraction layer that makes implementation of different filesystems very easy (https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/next/filesystems/vfs.html).\n Overall, VFS is masking the implementation details of a specific filesystem behind generic system calls (open/read/write/close/etc), which are mostly exposed to user-mode application by some wrappers in libc — as shown in the diagram below (https://www.starlab.io/blog/introduction-to-the-linux-virtual-filesystem-vfs-part-i-a-high-level-tour).\n Moreover, we can say that the main goal of VFS is to allow user-mode applications to access different filesystems (think about NTFS, FAT, etc.) in the same way. There are four main objects in VFS: superblock, dentries, inodes and files (https://www.win.tue.nl/~aeb/linux/lk/lk-8.html).\n Thus, “inode” (https://medium.com/@boutnaru/linux-what-is-an-inode-7ba47a519940) is what the kernel uses to keep track of files. Because a file can have several names there are “dentries” (“directory entries”) which represent pathnames. Also, due to the fact a couple of processes can have the same file opened (for read/write) there is a “file” structure that holds the information for each one (such as the cursor position). The “superblock” structure holds data which is needed for performing actions on the filesystem — more details about all of those and more (like mounting) are going to be published in the near future.\n Lastly, there are also other relevant data structures that I will post on in the near future (“filesystem”, “vfsmount”, “nameidata” and “address_space”).\n ​\n https://www.starlab.io/blog/introduction-to-the-linux-virtual-filesystem-vfs-part-i-a-high-level-tour\n    submitted by    /u/boutnaru  \n [link]   [comments]",

Unfortunately, with Wayland XScreensaver doesn't work so well and for that I don't blame the package as it simply is not implemented for Wayland in any manner.\n Don't get me wrong, there is something to be said for a system going into a semi-sleep mode when GNOME blanks the screen and the system becomes idle and the internal temperature is lowered by a lot. It is quite useful but also quite boring, and yes, I am aware of the goal of saving power for various reasons. Still, though, I've been entertained over the years by the sheer multitude of screen savers included in the package and enjoy watching them cycle along every few minutes or so. I also don't mind if the screen saver package blanks the screen after a half hour or so (user configurable, of course). At least with a screen saver I know my system hasn't crashed!\n Perhaps the limitation is technical and Wayland doesn't have the API that would permit a screen saver to work as it can on X.

Sadly, in the past year I've been experiencing a lot of small problems when updating my system (I use arch by the way, and before you blame that, keep in mind keeping things up to date with upstream is not beta, those project I assume test to the best of their abilities). Anyway, for example here are some issues I've had:\n - gtk issues (e.g. file chooser widget crash), that got patched a few days later.\n - SDL 2 crash on fullscreen issues, that got patched a few weeks later\n More recently:\n - Steam did a big update on their desktop ui and now I have to hold ctrl when mouse clicking widgets. Super annoying.\n - Anything going fullscreen is now having hiccups.\n So I googled what desktop environment steam deck uses, figuring that at least will get tested. So I installed kde-plasma-x11. The steam ctrl workaround is not necessary under that DE. And fullscreen doesn't hiccup. But I hate plasma. Everything is super slow to launch (i.e. 2 seconds). Worst, installing kde screwed up my configs and openbox is ugly now, and tracker3 is misbehaving so openging nautilus in openbox takes 10 seconds. I don't want to fix that issue because Steam and fullscreen still misbehave at the time of writing when I use openbox.\n I thought openbox was super stable, and the whole point of it was an exercice in writing a X11 compliant window manager. Is KDE full of non standard hack, which is why it works well while openbox doesn't? Or is there bugs in openbox that just will never get fixed and I should ditch it. Anyway. I know, this is a rant now. But my computer was running nice under it, and now it's not enjoyable under kde. I would try wayland to see, but for some reason it doesn't launch.\n    submitted by    /u/fluxrider  \n [link]   [comments]",

After updating some of the python2 scripts to python3, a brutal series of C compilation errors started coming. After some of those bugs were fixed, feels like it would help if I could just upgrade to the latest LTS 6.1.\n As a newbie, I directly merged the tag with my kernel and that was a disaster. There have been a lot of changes between and so I went back to fixing the old bugs for now. That made me wonder if there is a optimum way to upgrade old kernels without creating new bugs that would give me migraine.\n If you guys have any insights or experience on this please share.

          "description": "For the curious newbies out there:\n Repositories are one of the essential part of a distribution. Still, they are the most obscure knowledge piece about it. As far as i know Arch Linux with its official repositories and AUR has one of the largest package base leaving aside NixOS which is different on its own and is its own league. Debian boasts one of the largest official binary package database. Ubuntu hosts its own repositories and PopOS which is based on Ubuntu its seems is hosting its own repositories too. Fedora also has official as well as community repositories but its package collection is rather smaller than others.\n Flatpak, Snap, AppImage transcends the Distro packaging scheme and are standalone application pacakagers. They are their own base and are distroindependent. I don't know package count on them as they can be pretty susceptible to spaming. They also solve binary distribution problem for proprietary vendors and add useful features like sandboxing and portals generally enhancing the supposed security of the system. \n    submitted by    /u/Own_Language7325  \n [link]   [comments]",

I know that things have moved on a lot, and it's very difficult to keep up. It feels like the timeline has been:\n 2010 - Some games might be barely playable in Wine with a lot of fiddling\n 2020 - Now there's this amazing new distro called A/B/C which is really well preconfigured for running games.\n 2021 - What's the point in ABC when you can get really good drivers now in any distro\n 2022 - Ha, what peasants we were before, now there's this incredible new software which lets you magically play any Windows game with amazing performance, even better than Windows\n 2023 - What a joke, now there's XYZ solution, which literally lets you run any software on any system, and completely turns everything you thought you knew about Linux upside down, and you now you don't even know anything anymore.\n ?2024 - Just give up and throw away your computer and go and live in a cabin in the woods because you've gone mad.\n It literally does feel like that, and I've just completely lost track of these incredible new developments over the last few years, and so many of them seem like they really do change the entire paradigm of what Linux even is (at least the way people talk about them). And there seem to be so many competing magical solutions that I don't even know where to start.\n So if I wanted to run say the new Hitman games, and say, Sim Tower or Caesar 3, and also Halo Infinite, what's the best super magical doohickey these days? I know this is not r/linuxquestions(!), but to me this is less of a how a 'how do I solve this specific technical problem' question, and more of a 'what the heck is even going on these days in the bigger picture' sort of question.\n    submitted by    /u/H663  \n [link]   [comments]",

I’m forced to use windows as a scientific workstation on my work computer as a government data scientist and I completely understand why, and I have no expectations that Linux will “win on the desktop”, because it doesn’t need to.\n Despite so many Linux fans out there thinking really hard /s about how the community can best strategize to have a completely open hardware and software platform take over households across the world, in all use cases, especially the ones the Linux kernel is least suited for (like RTOS applications directing self driving cars, and, no the driving subsystems of Tesla don’t run on linux, the infotainment system does), we still have really nice linux things!\n On my desktop, I can run hyprland basically flawlessly with my 3070 using proprietary nvidia drivers. I just got a steam deck and now I can play all of my favorite video games on my couch in 4K on my big ol TV with a wireless controller. I still use a pretty locked down andoid phone for many things (though an iPhone for daily use because privacy). I have a raspberry pi to serve as the data collection backend for my home brewed weather station. My TV and both of my partners TVs have Linux as their smart TV OS.\n All of these things are a mix of GPLed software and binary blobs/closed source elements. It’s amazing just how robust the corporate environment for Linux really is and how it drives innovation and competition.\n And Debian is also a thing, I guess. Kinda.\n The truly best thing about Linux is how all the really serious developers aren’t ESR or RMS. They’re actually rational, successful people. The zealots lost the argument and we’re all better for it.\n It’s nice to have nice things.\n    submitted by    /u/sp0rk173  \n [link]   [comments]",

I'm curious to know if this would be a good and powerful choice for running Linux smoothly. I understand that Linux doesn't necessarily require a high-end processor to perform well, but I value your input on this matter. The reason behind my inquiry is that my current laptop, which is equipped with an NVIDIA RTX 3070, tends to encounter occasional issues after software updates...\n Considering these factors, I'm contemplating a switch to an AMD-based system. Hence, I would greatly appreciate hearing your thoughts and opinions on AMD processors and their compatibility with Linux.\n As for my background, I am a simple user who is currently studying IT. I spend my free time coding and playing casual games. \n Here is the link of this new laptop: https://wccftech.com/xiaomi-unveils-redmibook-pro-15-ryzen-edition-laptop-amd-ryzen-7-7840hs-apu/\n Thank you\n    submitted by    /u/mavinii  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Ever since I started seriously using Linux a few years ago, I always used Wayland. I really liked Fedora, so I used GNOME on Wayland, I also tried using KDE for a while, but that was also on Wayland. Overall, I barely touched Xorg during this entire time. I tried booting GNOME on Xorg but my touchpad gestures stopped working, so I immediately turned it off. Why bother with it if it's the outdated display server?\n Through my Linux experience, I discovered many issues - I desperately needed fractional scaling on my 14 inch 1080p laptop, which was always a blurry nightmare and I never managed to make it usable. I also experienced some visual glitches, like windows disappearing on GNOME with multiple monitors, etc. and I always figured that that's just what the Linux experience is like.\n Fast forward to a few days ago, when I installed Arch with the i3 window manager, the first environment running on Xorg that I've seriously used. And wow. So many issues are just gone, or at least very solvable. None of my apps are blurry with fractional scaling. Everything is smooth and looks good. It's like a different world.\n Wayland has some very cool features, like the responsive touchpad gestures, and it's definitely great for the future of Linux. As of now, if you're also bothered by the issues I was, consider giving them up for a way smoother and reliable desktop experience.\n    submitted by    /u/azdrawee  \n [link]   [comments]",

I started by installing CoolerControl, as that was the only thing I could find that worked with the fans I have(Lian Li al120 v12, connected to the included hub) and that works fine for fan speed control, but has no rgb. I was looking around online and can't seem to find anything that's compatible. I installed OpenRgb but it can't seem to detect any of the devices I have. I don't know if it's just my mistake or if my hardware just isn't compatible. Any fixes or alternatives would be greatly appreciated, I'll update if I find anything, Thanks!\n    submitted by    /u/Panda_369_  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I see many people talking about choosing the right hardware to run Linux and I always thought there were exaggerating. I was so wrong.\n Recently I decided to build a new PC and since I was using Linux on my laptop I thought \"Well, if I am building a new machine why not make it fully compatible with Linux?\"\n So I did it. Every single part of my build has good support for Linux. AMD Ryzen, ATI Radeon, etc., etc... I could not be happier. Everything works just as it was supposed to. I am running Fedora with Wayland and it has been an amazing experience.\n Newcomers to Linux should know that: If you just bought your PC it probably was designed to run Windows or MAC. Most companies do not care about Linux (yes, I am talking to you Nvdia). It does not mean that it won't run Linux, it just means that it has a great chance of not being a good experience and random problems will happen. Everything on Linux was made by people who dedicate some of their time to making things work because companies do not. They do an amazing job, but it is not the same as having all info necessary. Sure, your system can run very well, but it will never be as good as a well-thought Linux-compatible PC.\n You do not have to build one. Just find a company that sells laptops for example with full Linux support and you will be amazed by how good it is .\n ​\n TL;DR: To get the whole Linux experience you have to care about hardware as well. \n    submitted by    /u/colutti  \n [link]   [comments]",

Some say it has been flawed and broken from the start and some say that it's actually pretty good. \n A couple of examples.. \n https://serebit.com/posts/wayland-is-pretty-good/\n https://dudemanguy.github.io/blog/posts/2022-06-10-wayland-xorg/wayland-xorg.html\n Classic example of these two conflicting opinions. At this point, I just don't know what side to trust.

So far the only thing I'm sure about is that I'll choose an ubuntu based one.\n On my research I narrowed down to 2 options: Pop os and Zorin os.\n The thing that bums me out about Zorin Os is the fact that Zorin Group seems to take a lot of time to release a new update to their OS. And the thing that bums me out about Pop os is that they're about to change gnome for cosmic, and I don't know what to expect from this change. Will it be worse than gnome? I don't really know.\n But after all, I realize that for coding I won't have any big difference between theese two or any other distro. I just want to go for the one with the easiest usage for my daily activities.\n ​\n ** I'm Brazilian so I apologize for any grammar mistake, English is not my mother tongue. If you want to grade my English skills in a friendly way you're more than welcome, for sure I'll learn more than just linux from your comment :)\n    submitted by    /u/Davisall  \n [link]   [comments]",

Everything is working but only when I booted back to live USB, i found out I could modify the partition easily. I think it is a huge vulnerability.\n I made some minimal changes to the installation, like installing one or two packages and updating. So it isn't hard to reinstall and set everything up again. The problem is I am afraid it will cause additional writes to SSD and therefore reducing lifespan. (I know it's negligible and the one I am using isn't from a random brand.)\n So, is it worth it to perform a reinstall with encryption? Also what encryption should I use as a balance between performance and security?\n Btw, should I encrypt the EFI partition (/boot/efi) on the external SSD? I think I need to encrypt partitions instead of entire disk because I also have other partitions.

Some of the major improvements include:\n  \nExpanded Collection: Explore over 400 distro versions, including various End-of-Life releases \n Internet is enabled for signed-in users (most requests was for this). It's now possible download and install software packages in the VM.\n Better usability on small screen devices, allowing keyboard input and easy scrolling the VM screen.\n Login credentials and instructions are displayed for some distros to easily enter into live mode\n Improvements to minimize latency while accessing VMs.\n  \nI have also received requests to enable disks in the VMs to try out the installation process. However, it is not currently feasible due to cost concerns.\n Many thanks to everyone who donated and sent their valuable suggestions. I hope you all will find the updates useful. Check it out now at DistroSea- Test drive Linux distros online\n Note: Do not access personal data inside the VMs. Please shutdown the VM after use to immediately allocate the server resources for another user.\n I'm currently looking for sponsors.

          "description": "EDIT: done, couple folks reached out and they have the same issue\n Hey there folks!\n With some friends we were comparing Calibri to Aptos, Grandview, Seaford, Skeena, and Tenorite. I posted my write-up online[1] and was discussing it on Reddit[2], among other places.\n It seems, however, that Office 365 is rendering quite a few of Calibri Regular characters, but not Calibri Light, using Lato on Linux systems. This doesn't affect MacOS, which doesn't have Calibri installed by default, nor Calibri Light, which looks and works as expected on Office 365 also when accessed from Linux Systems.\n Can some of you friendly folk with access to Office 356 upload a screenshot of what you see when you format the words \"Calibri Regular\" with Calibri and Calibri Light on Word (at 18px) and Power Point (at 96px)?\n The curiosity is killing us :)\n Thanks !\n [1] https://jdsalaro.com/note/comparison-new-microsoft-default-font-calibri-aptos/\n [2] https://www.reddit.com/r/typography/comments/14zenfg/a_quick_look_into_microsofts_new_default_font/\n    submitted by    /u/jdsalaro  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "TL;DR Just some venting about a broken installation...\n My Arch installation just broke some hours ago. Working like a charm for quite some time now, this is the first major issue (besides those pesky Nvidia drivers) I encountered. And, to be honest, I have absolutely no idea what happened, my PC seemingly decided to not recognize the SSD as something it should boot from anymore. My first attempt at fixing this was checking the GPT / MBR and partitions with a Ubuntu live-installation using gdisk, which promptly complained that the EFI partition was not aligned properly. Wondered (still do) how that happened but proceeded to fix it with parted. I also mounted the partitions to check whether some important files were missing or corrupted, but everything was normal. With the GPT being valid, all partitions aligned and working and the boot flags set where needed I though my work was done and blissedly rebooted. Of course it didn't work. I unplugged every other drive that could somehow get in the way in the boot order (my PC is sometimes a bit whacky in regards to that), still not working. Then it occurred to me that maybe GRUB was somehow damaged and it could not load the 2nd or even 1st stage or something like that (I had used grub-install just before it broke down, but neither on the drive nor the partitions in question). Back on the Ubuntu I checked for that but it seems to be fine. As of now I currently contemplate whether it is worth to fiddle around some more or if it'd be better to just re-install and then restore my data.\n    submitted by    /u/Valcalen  \n [link]   [comments]",

Here are some steps to take:\n  \nSet up an OpenVPN server on your Synology device using the DSM admin interface. Make sure all necessary settings are configured, such as IP addresses, authentication protocols, and certificates.\n \nOn the router that is connected to the mobile operator's network, you need to forward the OpenVPN ports to the IP address of your Synology device. The standard OpenVPN port is 1194 (UDP). Check your router's manual for how to set up port forwarding.\n \nFor mobile carriers, you may also need to set up network address translation (NAT) on your router to redirect traffic from the external network to your Synology device's IP address on your local network. Consult your mobile operator's documentation or support for specific NAT setup instructions.\n \nMake sure the OpenVPN server is running on your Synology device.\n \n After completing these steps, you should be able to connect to the OpenVPN server on your Synology device from outside your mobile operator's network using the public IP address or dynamic DNS assigned to your router.\n It is also worth remembering that some mobile operators may block certain ports or protocols, which may make it difficult to access from outside. In this case, contact your mobile operator for more information on restrictions and how to bypass them.\n    submitted by    /u/maciej1993  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I initially wrote this simple TUI file manager a few months ago. I struggled with a few things such as scrolling files off screen, hovering them properly, resetting cursor position, etc. I've since learned more and implemented all my knowledge. This time around I made a push and pop implementation for bash, in bash, which made writing this file manager much easier. I wrote this to increase my productivity on the commandline; This allows me to navigates files much quicker and edit them without any trouble, no more worrying about copy/pasting names, remembering them or using wildcards to make up the difference. Instead of ls, cd, EDITOR, pwd, etc - They are handled by simply using the arrow keys or H, J, K, L respectively\n This is a compelete rewrite focused on stability, simplicity and design before continuing on to features. Majority of the fearures mentioned in the README.md are not implemented yet (adding more features is not hard). Anyway, I'm curious what everyone thinks about it; If you'd use it, what could change, etc. Any testers, contributions or feedback is really, much appreciated!\n    submitted by    /u/wick3dr0se  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "You might have heard the news that China has released a homegrown Linux distro dubbed OpenKylin. I know very well that stuff made-in-China (especially those labeled \"independently created\") can be pretty sloppy in implementation details. So consider this post \"how not to properly configure a Linux system\". Here we go:\n  \nThe ISO archive doesn't have checksums. MD5 values are available at the official website\n Some common CLI utilities (less, man) are not installed by default.\n I've received two system upgrades since fresh install. Both upgrades are tagged w/ version 602.0001 and share the same patch notes. The version number cannot be found in dpkg -l. There must be another package management mechanism running. \n ...and it's definitely not Flatpak. Although Flatpak is preinstalled, no remotes (not even flathub) are preconfigured\n \n APT is configured w/ APT::Get::AllowUnauthenticated=true, effectively bypasses package signing. \n Combining the fact that the default APT repository is accessed via plain-text HTTP, this is wide open to man-in-the-middle attacks.\n \n Docker is preinstalled and enabled. The Docker bridge network is configured as \"bip\": \"128.128.0.1/16\". You can't access this part of the Internet anymore.\n (Important) packages can be outdated. ca-certificates is at version 20190110 which is four years old.\n /etc/localtime is a symlink to /usr/share/zoneinfo/Asia/Shanghai but the content of /etc/timezone is Etc/UTC.\n Proprietary packages (e.g. nvidia-driver-510) can be installed via apt without editing the default sources.list. I guess they don't have to worry about legal issues.\n Like Ubuntu, systemd-resolved is the default DNS service. But theres' also a dnsmasq service enabled, listening to 127.0.0.1:53 with the default upstream set to 114.114.114.114 (provided by www.114dns.com) \n Though systemd-resolved is running with stock config file. No custom upstream configured.\n \n  \nFeel free to ask me for stuff that you are curious about.\n    submitted by    /u/ImaginaryMarketing  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "A year ago today, I wrote a journal entry making plans to end everything. It wasn't the first such entry, either. I was deeply addicted to gaming, sinking lower and lower, year by year. I was a complete loser, life was challenging and depressing, and I couldn't feel any joy.\n Then, in one computer science lecture, the professor was talking about Linux, and mentioned, “Linux is an important OS for computer science. But I don't think any of you should install it, because it will break your computer, unless you know what you're doing.”\n I had heard of Linux, but used to dismiss it as a niche OS. Curiosity got the better of me, and I decided to try it out anyway, my first distro being Ubuntu. I was amazed how well it ran compared to Windows. I was also learning new stuff and customizing things left and right.\n Even more amazingly, I felt joy for the first time in a long time. Real joy.\n However, I didn't know what I was doing, and broke my computer just as the professor foretold. I had to reinstall Ubuntu many times. During one of these reinstall, I accidentally wiped the entire disk, including the Windows installation I was dual-booting to play my games.\n The enjoyment I got from using and customizing Linux, combined with a laziness to install Windows, was exactly what I needed to eventually get rid of my gaming addiction. It had a hold over me for over a decade, and I was finally free. Linux also led the way to me rediscovering some of my older hobbies, as well as restoring my enjoyment of coding.\n Now, one year from that journal entry, life is still incredibly difficult and overwhelming at times, but I have regained hope. And I find joy in my activities, not the least of which is simply using my computer running Linux. Linux saved my life and turned it around. I am eternally grateful.\n    submitted by    /u/_Aetos  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I've had quite the long think about what RHEL has been doing to the open source projects a great many of us know and love (first CentOS, now Alma, Rocky, etc.) and I think the problem is summed up like this: \"Line goes up\"\n If a publicly traded company is behind an open source project, that open source project is at risk because, line must go up. They will make up any excuse why the line is not going up and make terrible decisions to hopefully make the line go up.\n I've been a CentOS user for years and now a rocky linux user, but I think it's time to leave that flavor behind entirely. So with that in mind I was looking at other options, Ubuntu being one of them because of the option for enterprise support, but there it is again \"Line goes up\".\n This is why I intend to switch to Debian 12, the latest long term supported version of Debian. Debian is bona fide community run open source project with no profit margins, shareholders, executives, etc. Therefore for Debian there is no line that must go up.\n I implore you as Linux lovers and enjoyers to switch to a distribution in no way tied to a company or gets source from a company and return to the community backed projects that made Linux what it is today.\n Edit: it's surprising to me people still don't know what the issue is.

          "description": "One often stated premise as to why the GPLv2 and certain licenses deemed incompatible by the community is: dynamic linking obviously creates a derived work.\n See for instance the Software Freedom Conservancy's view:\n  \nThe FSF, stewards of the GPL, have stated many times over the past decades that they believe there is no legal distinction between dynamic and static linking of a C program and we agree.\n  \nBut is there any solid reason to believe this is the case? Any case law? Any reasoning from similar facts?\n Because my admittedly shallow view is -- I'm just not sure a copyright license has this kind of power.\n Imagine an extreme case, you build some software which links to MegaEvil Corp's libc, which license specifically states, if you dynamically link to this libc, your work is a derived work of MegaCorp libc, and you forfeit all claims of copyright of your work to MegaEvil Corp. My guess is many courts would say building any such software at an API boundary would be fair use, and copyright law simply does not grant any court the power to enforce this copyright term.\n Why might I guess this is the case? Because courts have actually taken similar positions several times re: software fair use. See, Sega Enterprises Ltd. v. Accolade, Inc., 977 F.2d 1510 (9th Cir. 1992), and Lewis Galoob Toys, Inc. v. Nintendo of America, Inc., 780 F. Supp. 1283 (N.D. Cal. 1991).\n But much worse than the SFC and FSF simply being incorrect is, I worry they either 1) don't know any better or are 2) purposefully misleading users about what the GPL says, and how copyright law works. By encouraging a cramped reading of the GPL and ignoring copyright fair use, they are actually making it harder to build software which interoperates with other software (see ZFS and Linux), and, while the FSF seemed to take Google's side in the Oracle v. Google case, their reasoning re: dynamic linking puts them squarely within Oracle's intellectual camp with respect to copyright fair use.\n    submitted by    /u/small_kimono  \n [link]   [comments]",

Can someone maybe have an idea?\n Curious to hear if anyone got similar problems that only one type of distro/DE seems to be fine for you.\n *** I mainly want to start a discussion & not having anyone really trying to troubleshoot my linux issues, but any advice is welcome.\n That's the summary.\n ​\n The TLDR part :\n So first here my pc specs:\n - Motherboard: MSI x570s Tomahawk Max Wifi\n - CPU: AMD Ryzen 9 5950X (32) @ 3.980GHz\n - GPU: NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3080 Ti (EVGA FTW3)\n - RAM: 32GB …",

Apparently I needed further justification so I stated (I use a cracked version of windows) it had more customizability, offered more safety and privacy. Apparently I have 'something to hide' for context I have a history of anxiety & psychosis which is known to her.\n Eventually she looked up what linux was: 'All the top results said it was great but when I scrolled down it said tor was used for terrorist, drug deals and various other crimes. She didn't even notice that tor and linux was different from 5 minutes of research. I tried to argue saying it was cherry-picked and a scandal by the media to which and I kid you not she compared me to flat earthers.

Its based on debian and apparently pycharm isn't fully supported in it.\n Arch Linux- I tried getting MYSQL workbench to work but it just wouldn't recognize a mariadb server or a percona one. I tried getting the vanilla one but to no avail, I have absolutely no clue up to this date on that, but the other applications seem to work well.\n  \nSo I was thinking... what other distros are good for portable OS?\n P.S.

          "description": "An inode (aka index node) is a data structure used by Unix/Linux like filesystems in order to describe a filesystem object. Such an object could be a file or a directory. Every inode stores pointers to the disk block’s locations of the object’s data and metadata (https://www.bluematador.com/blog/what-is-an-inode-and-what-are-they-used-for). An illustration of that is shown below.\n Overall, the metadata contained in an inode is: file type (regular file/directory/symbolic link/block special file/character special file/etc), permissions, owner id, group id, size, last accessed time, last modified time, creation time and number of hard links (https://www.stackscale.com/blog/inodes-linux/).\n By using inodes the filesystem tracks all files/directories saved on disk. Also, by using inodes we can read any specific byte in the data of a file very effectively. We can see the number of total inodes per mounted filesystem using the command “df -i” (https://linux.die.net/man/1/df). Also, we can see the inode of a file/directory and other metadata of the file using the command “ls -i” (https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/ls.1.html) or “stat” (https://linux.die.net/man/1/stat). By the way, the “stat” command uses the “stat” syscall (https://linux.die.net/man/2/stat).\n Lastly, you can check out “struct inode” in the source code of the Linux kernel (https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v6.4.2/source/include/linux/fs.h#L612). Not all the points/links are directly connected to the data blocks, however I will elaborate on that in a future writeup. \n ​\n https://www.sobyte.net/post/2022-05/linux-inode/\n    submitted by    /u/boutnaru  \n [link]   [comments]",

I can live without features present in the windows client like background blur/image, reactions in a call, and sharing single windows, but the horrible effect on system responsiveness that Teams produces is not bearable. When I'm in a call my machine becomes noticably less snappy, which does not happen for my colleagues with windows machines. Turning off my camera seems to help as does disabling incoming video.

Nothing was included. Every single basic step involved running into roadblocks, researching them, trying out various solutions and experimenting to get it working. And some things never worked.\n Wifi? - no driver for my wifi adapter. Have to install a driver, and it has missing dependencies.\n Bluetooth? - no bluetooth software. Have to figure it out too.\n Samba? - No samba client. No samba server. Have to set it up by editing conf files. Never got it working right.\n FTP? - No FTP. Have to set it up. More conf files. Never got it working right.\n Don't want the computer to go to sleep? More conf files.\n Anyway ... after a few days of this I gave up, installed Ubuntu and got everything set up easily in a few hours.\n Nevertheless -- I take seriously people's criticisms of the direction Ubuntu is going in. So my question is -- is there another distro out there that won't have me tearing my hair out? That includes the basic functionality of a modern OS?\n I'm very distrustful of the distro \"round-ups\" online, because none of them gave me any indication of what a DIY nightmare Debian was.\n    submitted by    /u/icelandic_toe_thumb  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hello,\n I find myself questioning whether using GUI is actually a good thing. I've seen people online making videos about how tiling window managers are undermining your productivity, and that things like it are just a distraction. A regular person is/should incapable of multitasking when they are focussed on let's say, programming.\n There's further discussions to be had about stripping any shell/terminal of syntax highlighting, as well as code syntax highlighting, and having everything be the same color.\n I'm mainly concerned with this as I am trying to find a way to use linux to train myself to become a better programmer, and to function in a development environment where GUIless is the standard.\n Another frequent problem is that GUI adjacent stuff always sparks a lot of conversation and I want to ideally have an environment that is as neutral and unexpressive as possible, because I don't want any slight hint of expression of personality ruining my job prospects. For this reason I always stick to default color themes and fonts, because these choices were made for me, and therefore by not changing them I am not expressing any opinion. My job is to do my job.\n How is this looked upon in industries where people use linux distros in production? I really need to commit to something that is objectively as non-offensive as possible. I do not want to get yelled at.\n I hope someone can share some insight, and recommend a distro that's focussed on GUIless, probably.\n    submitted by    /u/SomebodyInACity  \n [link]   [comments]",

I don't need their cloud, because, at the moment, I'm looking only for offline features.

          "description": "The kernel thread “inet_frag_wq” is created using a workqueue (https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v6.2-rc1/source/net/ipv4/inet_fragment.c#L211), we could have guessed it based on a workqueue do to the “wq” suffix. It is used for fragment management of IP packets. Thus the goal of “inet_frag_wq” is to reassemble fragmented IPv4/IPv6 packets (https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v6.2-rc1/source/net/ipv4/inet_fragment.c#L6).\n Overall, the goal of IP fragmentation is to split packets into smaller chunks in order to allow them to meet the MTU (Maximum Transmission Unit) requirement of a specific network. There is an implementation difference between IP fragmentation in IPv4 and IPv6. On IPv4 the information needed for fragmentation is part of the IPv4 header which in IPv6 there is a specific “Fragmentation Header” (https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/ipv6-fragmentation-header/). An illustration of the flow is shown in the diagram below both for IPv4 and IPv6.\n Thus, “inet_frag_wq” is relevant when a fragmented IP packet arrives at a specific system. The OS stores the fragmented packets in a queue and reassembles them before they are passing the data to the upper layers of the network stack. The fragment queue is represented by \"struct inet_frag_queue\" (https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v6.2-rc1/source/include/net/inet_frag.h#L66). \n Moreover, we can see in the source code the function “ip_frag_reasm” which is responsible for building a new IP datagram from all of its fragments (https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v6.2-rc1/source/net/ipv4/ip_fragment.c#L411). \n https://notes.shichao.io/tcpv1/ch10/, https://blog.quarkslab.com/analysis-of-a-windows-ipv6-fragmentation-vulnerability-cve-2021-24086.html \n ​\n ​\n    submitted by    /u/boutnaru  \n [link]   [comments]",

I cared for it, upgraded software, and generally tried to keep it healthy. It was prone to blue-screens of death, horrible wifi connectivity issues, and handful of other nuisances. I upgraded to Win 11 and that was a trade up a little but the machine was unstable frequently enough that I was considering getting rid of the machine.\n Then, one day, the SSD on the machine outright dies. I didn't have a full backup so I decided to take the risk and install Ubuntu on the new SSD.\n I am delighted with the functionality under Ubuntu and Gnome, AND the stability of the machine has gone up to near perfect.\n Of course, everyone has difference experiences, but I wanted to share that you CAN win with using linux (Ubuntu) on a laptop over Windows... particularly for stability over Windows.\n Have a great day!\n    submitted by    /u/ReginaMulvinaLunt  \n [link]   [comments]",

This tool will do the following:\n  \nIdentify what \"snap\" apps are currently installed on their computer.\n Automatically download the corresponding \"Flatpak\" version of those apps.\n Remove the \"snap\" version from their system.\n  \nTo make this tool work better, I need a list of \"snap\" apps that also have \"Flatpak\" versions available. I started with a list from a project called \"unsnap,\" but it's a bit outdated now, so I'm looking for a more updated and comprehensive list.\n If you know of any recent and complete lists of \"snap\" apps with their \"Flatpak\" alternatives, I would really appreciate your help. This way, more people can use the tool to switch to \"Flatpak\" packages easily, even for a larger variety of apps.

Would be BTRFS a good pick for hdd or should I pick other file system? If I was installing Linux on ssd I would've picked F2FS.\n    submitted by    /u/mendelir  \n [link]   [comments]",

This adds a bit of mess in my UX.\n This \"plugin\" keeps track of the status of some git subcommands that require a branch name (switch, checkout, merge, rebase, log are now supported).\n If you mistype the branch name, this tool will try to correct the command.\n For example: You type git switch main, but the main branch does not exist in the current repo – BranchFixer will correct the branch name to master.\n Thus, git switch master will be executed instead of git switch main.\n If it's useful to anyone, use it :)\n https://github.com/sigseg5/BranchFixer/\n P.S.

          "description": "I have been a Linux user since the year 2019. I used to run Linux on my all-in-one PC, which had an Intel CPU without any dedicated GPU. The experience there was perfect; I had zero complaints with any of the distributions I tried, but the story changed when I recently bought a gaming laptop with an RTX 3050.\n As expected, the first thing I did was to remove Windows and try to install Fedora on it. At first, the live USB wouldn't even boot because of the missing GPU drivers, so I tried the safe graphics mode, and then, after completing the install, I added the Nvidia drivers. In the beginning, it worked fine, but after some time, performance issues started to occur. Sometimes the OS freezes on the login screen or gives me a blank screen after I enter my password and press enter.\n I was determined that I wanted to use Linux because I like the playing around and freedom that it gives the user, so I tried other distros based on Fedora, RHEL, Ubuntu, and even Arch. I tried different DEs and switched between X11 and Wayland, but everything always gave me some kind of performance dip or left my laptop unresponsive just because of the GPU.\n In the past, when I used Linux on my PC and an old laptop that didn't have a GPU, it always worked fine, but now I am forced to use Windows just because Nvidia has a shitty Linux support.\n At this point I am tired of trying to configure everything by myself and yet getting no results, but I really want to move away from windows so if you guys got any suggestions, I am open to that.\n    submitted by    /u/sexysenpailoves69  \n [link]   [comments]",

Usually while programming you'd want your data that's used in multiple places to be anchored to variables.\n I'm kinda struggling to find a general purpose way of transfering colors, fonts, sizes, across very different applications i.e. terminal, i3config, gtk...\n I'm not a top notch programmer but i'm not an idiot either. I've mulled over the issue for a little while and would like opinions before commiting to what i'd consider to be a sizeable amount of work.\n I'm not comming here empty handed either.\n Take the terminal for instance: gogh has a build process that uses yaml for theme definitions, python for generation/building and bash for installation. It would be pretty easy to use/hijack the build process by simply generating a yaml def.\n For anything that's css-like: a tool like sass or similar is perfect, i'd just have to include my variables. I've seen a couple gtk themes using this.\n Any other configuration that uses text files should be trivial, i'm just uncertain what would be the least painful approach.\n Preprocessing options i've been coming across are: - awk / sed - probably the most painful approach imo - gpp - first time using it but seems to be a good powerful solution - node using gulp or grunt and whatever other rendering tool - i have some experience with this toolset but i feel it's not suited for the task and at this point any programming language that has printf/template strings would give the same result.\n What i'm considering is using make to process sources into a build/staging folder and then letting each 'facet' of themeing run their own build processes if needed.\n So what approach have you been using to tackle this problem?\n    submitted by    /u/Nulltan  \n [link]   [comments]",

The theory is these drives have custom firmware, but I believe it's just as simple as a serial number pair for the drives and dock, plus a 256 bit SATA drive password.\n Installing one of these drives in a PC and attempting to boot from it results in a password prompt. The first 4,096 sectors are supposedly reserved and cannot be read by the host PC over USB. Some people have reported certain Linux tools would allow them to reset the SATA password but I'm not sure this is true. Others have claimed \"true\" drive cloners could access and dump these reserved sectors, assuming that is true as well.\n This video discusses it but it's nearly a decade old, when these products were relatively new. Has anyone made any tools to dump these sectors, reset the SATA passwords, or do a more complete wipe of these cartidges to make them usable as standard SATA drives?\n https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymEB0Ay8QTo\n    submitted by    /u/Titan_91  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I consider cross-platform for PC software as Linux, Windows and x86 Mac.\n I've tried a bit of AutoKey, not a lot. AutoHotkey I've used for a while, it does allow creating UI's, but it feels wrong. It's not cross-platform.\n What would you consider a good solution or stack to create similar functionality?\n What functionality? Good question. AutoHotkey and AutoKey let you remap, input devices. I'm not going to say all input devices, but it seems possible. So you hit Mouse4 on your mouse and that could do anything, like press, (Ctrl+~ ; htop) for a quick htop macro if using something like a quake-mode terminal. You do have to manually type each macro by hand. So asking what functionality is it just letting the user type some hotkey in a text file, or is it a UI letting them record a macro, ala vim style.\n I'd rather it be easier for the user and they can choose, a UI or CLI + user created macro file, both options able to be used on demand.\n I'm sure I could name any language or libs/stack and someone could find a way to create it using that. What would you suggest?\n EDIT:\n Came across a post mentioning Python as a possible replacement for AutoHotkey and how it's faster to create a UI. It's not about that for me or this project. The primary goal is cross-platform OSS, if it can't do that, it's not comparable. To me the only difficulty would be finding a library that already has the ability to accept any form of user input from any input device. If the language doesn't offer that, then that language is not an option as this isn't a driver-level project.\n What about something like QMK firmware found on some advanced keyboards? If you know what I just said, fist bump. If you're familiar with Steam Input and how that lets you configure controllers, that's a bit like QMK firmware. That's the goal, to let the user be able to do anything with their devices. I'm ignorant if some library like that exists, you think a gamedev would be able to better answer the question?\n    submitted by    /u/blitz4  \n [link]   [comments]",

Here is an example https://blog.martin-graesslin.com/blog/2015/01/why-screen-lockers-on-x11-cannot-be-secure/\n Majority of the complaints repeat the following as some of the primary reasons\n  \nX has no concept of screen lockers.\n A screen locker is just another client for X.\n There is no privileged process which acts as the one and only screen locker\n If the locker crashes you have access to the machine.\n On X11: it’s not possible to prevent that other windows grab screen content. (This is something that Wayland can solve that X11 never can)\n  \nMy questions is why don't display managers take on the task of locking sessions.\n For instance I use LightDM. It seems to run as root, and is what is starting the X server for me.\n If LightDM (or any similar display manager) had a concept of locking sessions, then wouldn't that solve most problems.\n  \nThe display manager could just lock the current session in a given VT\n It will then switch/redirect users to a different VT where the password dialog shows up (this is a different process).\n On successful authentication we can notify the original DM process to unlock the session.\n  \nLight-locker seems to operate similarly, but LightDM itself does not really seem to know anything about it.\n Obviously we still cannot prevent 5. which is inherent to Xorg, but if I don't care about 5.

I’ve done some google searches and wasn’t able to find details on the following question.\n Are there any other Enterprise level distributions (Ubuntu, Suse, etc) that have downstream distributions of their enterprise level offerings? From the exposure I’ve had to Ubuntu, there are some security and live patches and faster security fixes. These features are behind a paywall and presumably eventually end up in the main Ubuntu distribution. I am also not aware of any downstream builds of Ubuntu Pro or Suse Linux Enterprise.\n As I’m NOT an enterprise user putting boxes into production with business on the line, and everything I’m reading is that Centos Stream will likely handle what I’m trying to do without much fuss.\n Am I missing something here?

          "description": "Hi all, \n I'm facing some issues related to the replacement of the my Macbook Pro early 2015 battery. \n The story: Few years ago I stopped to use my Macbook and at that time the original battery was at 80% capacity. After 1 year (maybe more) I take back my mac and it didn't started without power supply (in the meanwhile nobody used it). Tried to take in charge it for several hours, but not changed, the battery was KO. \n In add to this, few weeks ago I installed Fedora on my macbook, because MacOS was really slow. The OS works flawlessly, but of course nothing changed regarding the battery (need the power supply to turn on). \n Last week I bought a non-original battery (a good one, considering the price - I hope :D) but what happens now is that my macbook still do not turn on without power supply, but immediately after the apple logo come up, I can pull off the charger and the macbook go on with its own battery. The strange things: \n - Fedora do not recognize the battery (tried by terminal), also if in that moment it's working with that \n - The mac wants the power supply just to turn on (with just the battery it doesn't start). \n Already tried few SMC reset but nothing changed. Also tried another battery, but got the same result. \n What it could be? Do you have any recommendations? \n Thank you in advance. \n    submitted by    /u/rainbowsixjjj  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I know this question is probably seen alot here, but I'm a Linux beginner, I know a little about it and have dabled in it a little bit but not much other then a few basic commands.\n I feel like Linux Mint is a bit too basic for me and for what I would like to do. I am interested in learning the Linux terminal to possibly learn a bit of network type stuff.\n I have tried Kali but it is debated wether or not it is recommended due to learning how to installl the apps Kali gives you is advised rather then using Kali as a package if you're interested in the cyber security stuff which is one of my main interests. I have tried Ubuntu but that also seems to not be reccomended anymore. Linux Mint looks very basic and I feel like I wouldnt be able to do everything I want in it.\n Bare in mind I would like to daily drive Linux eventually, and due to ease of use I'd like it to be a Debian based distro.\n UPDATE I didnt write the post very well, Im not dissing mint at all, I just dont think its my kind of OS and I'd like something that skews a bit more away from the windows side of things.\n    submitted by    /u/raetypical  \n [link]   [comments]",

Now, you can easily compare the availability of custom Android ROMs, custom recoveries, and Linux distributions between devices.\n What is Customrombay?\n Customrombay is the largest database of custom ROMs, with support for over 550 devices. Our goal is to support as many custom ROMs and devices as possible and provide quality information about them.\n Contributing\n Contributing to Customrombay is highly encouraged, as it helps the project grow. More information is available on the contributing page.\n Open source\n Customrombay.org is completely open source. You can find us on GitHub. Our code is licensed under the MPL-2.0 license.\n Phones with notable Linux support\n For now, only information about Ubuntu Touch support is available on our website. We plan to extend that to PostmarketOS and NixOS. But which devices does Ubuntu Touch support? For example those:\n  \nOnePlus 6 (enchilada)\n OnePlus 6T (fajita)\n OnePlus One (bacon)\n Xiaomi Poco F1 (beryllium)\n Xiaomi POCO X3 (surya)\n Sony Xperia X (suzu)\n Google Pixel 3a (sargo)\n ASUS Zenfone Max Pro M1 (X00TD)\n  \n   submitted by    /u/Piotr_Lange  \n [link]   [comments]",

Also some old Suse and Knoppix as live CD but that's a whole different thing.\n What I want to do is:\n - hook the notebook up to the network\n - let a linux distrubtion be the OS\n - run Jellyfin/Kodi or an alternativ to hook up my quite big digital CD collection into a streaming setup to use it as spotify alternativ \n So I installed Fedora Server, got PTSD Flashbacks to MS-DOS and said hell no I need an GUI. SO I installed Fedora Workstation.\n Rat Head enters the chat, does what we all know.\n He is the point, I don't want to go away from Microsoft to then Popo love without lubricants by Red Hat.\n I thought about using Mint, I like the Cinamon GUI they use. (I know I could theoretical tinker cinamon onto fedora even I don't know yet how). \n But I'm not sure how good Mint is for what I want to use it.

Red Hat never offered binary packages outside their own RHEL distribution channels.\n RHEL's unique value proposition is being well tested, stable, and standards compliant, with bug fixes delivered ASAP. Red Hat invests lots of money, time, effort to deliver this in RHEL, whereas the RHEL clones don't offer added value beyond being cheaper. I find it hard to argue: 1) any user has a right to a continuous stream of updates, especially where 2) that user is seeking to wipe away any return on Red Hat's investment.\n Second, Red Hat is a business, and we need to stop pretending every FOSS business should be some quasi-public trust.

At first I thought it was unnecessary because I already have a high-end computer, but this innocent wrong gift literally changed my life.\n For being low-end, Windows 10 was running very poorly, and I decided to install Ubuntu just for testing, and man... how freakin awesome Linux is! At first it's kinda hard because you don't even know cd or apt , but the more you try stuff, the more you learn how to do things efficiently, and even more important, you learn how to actually solve problems by yourself.\n Yesterday I changed GNOME for KDE, and holy ****, it's a new world of customization, and I just can't get enough of this feeling of exploring a whole new land. Even when I get frustrated after failing multiple times trying to do something, the thirst for overcoming challenges seems endless!\n I don't know if I'm being crazy for thinking that exploring an OS is thrilling, but I just feel like an 7 years old kid learning how to do things on a computer for the first time, but in a very depth/technical way (at least in my head lol).\n After this awesome experience, I finally decided to go for a computing college, and I just can't thank my mother enough for giving me a shi*** computer lol.

However, it has several limitations: a) it requires the use of L2 distance for efficient clustering, which also b) restricts the data you're clustering to be vectors, and c) doesn't require the means to be datapoints in the dataset.\n Unlike in k-means, the k-medoids problem requires cluster centers to be actual datapoints, which permits greater interpretability of your cluster centers. k-medoids also works better with arbitrary distance metrics, so your clustering can be more robust to outliers if you're …",

          "description": "“mm_percpu_wq” is a kernel thread based on a workqueue which is created in the “init_mm_internals” function (https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v6.4-rc5/source/mm/vmstat.c#L2100). It is part of the the statistics management regarding virtual memory (https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v6.4-rc5/source/mm/vmstat.c#L5). An overview diagram of virtual memory is shown below.\n Overall, “mm_percpu_wq” is the worker thread which updates different counters about the virtual memory of a Linux system. It is also called the “vmstat worker” (https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v6.4-rc5/source/mm/vmstat.c#L2021). “vmstat” stands for “Virtual Memory Statistics” which includes information such as: number of free pages, number of mapped pages, number or dirty pages, amount of memory allocated to kernel stacks and more (there are more than 150 different counters).\n The statistics can be read from the file “/proc/vmstat” (https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man5/proc.5.html). This proc entry is created with others (“buddyinfo, “pagetypeinfo” and “zoneinfo”) in the same file in which “mm_percpu_mm” is allocated (https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v6.4-rc5/source/mm/vmstat.c#L2123). We can see the list of the metric counters in the source code (https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v6.4-rc5/source/mm/vmstat.c#L1168).\n As it names suggested the kernel thread is responsible for accumulating the vm events among all CPUs (https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v6.4-rc5/source/mm/vmstat.c#L126). It is done by going over all the “online” CPUs (https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v6.4-rc5/source/mm/vmstat.c#L117).\n ​\n https://iboysoft.com/wiki/virtual-memory.html\n    submitted by    /u/boutnaru  \n [link]   [comments]",

I hear that Nvidia cards can have issues with the display if you run dual monitors that have variable refresh rates/resolutions (on Wayland). Is this still true?\n ​\n My main monitor is 1440p 144hz but I also use my older 1080P 75hz panel as a secondary display. Are the issues with Nvidia in this case bad enough to warrant a switch to an AMD card? I don't mind getting a new RX 6800XT since they are available for around $500.\n ​\n Any insights would be appreciated.\n ​\n Edit: Forgot all about another major issue. I had to undervolt my GPU and put a custom fan curve on Afterburner to keep temps under 80c. It is a Zotac dual fan with underwhelming cooling. Ambient temps where I live can go as high as 32c in summer. I guess that's another point for an AMD upgrade since apparently, you cannot undervolt NVidia on Linux? \n    submitted by    /u/Salty-Leader-7859  \n [link]   [comments]",

I don't need onboard wifi, which the Z590-A lacks, as I will only be using wired LAN, and I like that it has nice PCI-E slot options (3 x16 and an x4) and can take up to 128 GB (64 would be enough for my needs, though I like having room to go higher if needed.) I have a Radeon RX 6600 XT that I got for a good price a couple months ago but it still waiting to be used until I get everything else to build this system.\n One motherboard that I've come across that appears to meat my criteria is ASUS Prime Z590-A which is LGA 1200, which I found via:\n https://pcpartpicker.com/product/fwVmP6/asus-prime-z590-a-atx-lga1200-motherboard-prime-z590-a\n The problem is I am having a hard time fining good information of how well it might be supported by Debian 12, or Linux in general, so I would really appreciate any insight and guidance, as well as any good alternatives, including AMD boards. I just need similar PCI-E options as above (either multple x16s or one x16 and some x4 and/or x8 slots - I will only be running the one graphics card so one x16 is needed for that, I need other slots for a capture card and other hardware that are mainly x4 max.)\n Thanks.\n    submitted by    /u/blz8  \n [link]   [comments]",

I'm looking for a Linux distribution that prioritizes bug fixes and provides quick security updates without focusing too much on additional features. After some research, I've narrowed down my options to Fedora and Ubuntu LTS, but I'm having trouble deciding which one would be the better choice.\n On one hand, Fedora is known for its cutting-edge nature and frequent updates, which could potentially mean faster bug fixes and security patches. However, the rapid pace of development may also introduce new bugs or stability issues.\n On the other hand, Ubuntu LTS (Long Term Support) versions are designed to provide a stable and reliable experience over an extended period. They prioritize bug fixes and security updates while minimizing major changes, making them ideal for users who value stability.\n Considering my primary focus on bug fixes and quick security updates, which distribution do you think would be the better choice for me? Have you had any personal experiences with either Fedora or Ubuntu LTS regarding their maintenance and support?\n I appreciate any insights, opinions, or personal experiences you can share to help me make an informed decision.

          "description": "Apologies but asking here as /r/linuxquestions is still locked.\n I work for a private ISP, we sell managed networks to customers with various services. I have a VMware ESXi server, and to simplify things let's say it currently has 10 VMs, each VM having a management NIC, and a customer VLAN NIC. Currently I can use a service like NRPE to execute commands on each VM, and NRPE runs a networking command (like a cURL, ping, or similar) over the customer network NIC. The NRPE agent listens on the management NIC, but executes the commands over the customer VLAN NIC.\n Customer wise, for simplicity we'll say customers are called Customer1, Customer2, Customer3, and so on. Their VLANs correspond like 10, 20, 30, and so on. Each customer network has an identical IP space of 10.0.0.0/8, and the IP of this VM will be identical in each of the networks.\n I'm building a new VM which has a single management NIC, and a single trunk NIC (VLAN 4095 in VMware parlance). I've tested configuring the secondary NIC on the VM as Customer1 with VLAN 10 tagged, and that works fine (so the port is all good), but I'm having trouble with network namespaces. My end goal is to be able to run commands like ip netns exec customer1 ping 8.8.8.8 and get the results (quick crap example, but you get the idea).\n I tried to borrow the principles from this article but it wouldn't work for me. \n Update: Now resolved thanks to /u/J4yD4n suggestion of splitting the trunk interface in to separate per-VLAN subints and then attaching namespaces to them individually.\n    submitted by    /u/iDemonix  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Working from a personal PC has the downside of being responsible for its availability, regardless of what happens, as well as ensuring its safety against any invasion. Currently, my approach is as follows:\n ​\n  \nHaving a Linux PC for work.\n \nUsing separate email accounts for different purposes.\n \nUsing secure passwords for each account.\n \nUsing one browser for confidential tasks and another for non-confidential tasks.\n \nAvoiding logging in with confidential emails on unsafe devices.\n \nNever saving or copying passwords.\n \nNot sharing the number used for two-step authentication with work colleagues.\n \nProviding fake personal information on each email account, such as a mother's name.\n \nAvoiding the installation of unknown repositories, programs, or scripts.\n \n ​\n That covers the safety aspect.\n ​\n To ensure reliability, I always keep an external HD on hand that I can quickly use for work in case anything goes wrong with my work PC.\n ​\n I'm considering what else I could do. I've heard that password management apps are very secure, and some even offer two-step authentication. Additionally, syncing a folder to Google Drive might be the best way to ensure uninterrupted access to important data, regardless of any issues. However, I'm unsure if encrypting the HD has any downsides, such as decreased read/write speed or the risk of data loss due to errors.\n ​\n Ideally, for a reliable and safe scenario, it would be convenient to have all data saved in the cloud without the associated risks.\n ​\n What are your thoughts? \n    submitted by    /u/Vic13131  \n [link]   [comments]",

Now, I already have my boot image file itself (640x480 24-bit color-depth bitmap) that's 901 KB in size. The trouble is, when I download a boot image from a community site that serves themes and boot logos, the boot logos are like 21 KB in size (that inflate to 901 KB .BMPs), and the default boot logo is deflated to a scant 10 KB! And it, too, inflates to 901 KB. When I use gzip to compress my file, I use the -v9k flag and only manage 84.1%, resulting in a compressed filesize of 144 KB.

          "description": "Greetings, penguins. Got a question. So recently I had dual-boot Kali with Windows. After some failed usage of Kali I found out in web that Kali is not the best for desktop (better use with live boot). Then I transferred to Arch Linux, again dual-boot with Windows. But Arch wasn't so user friendly as I've expected. Instead of working for myself I was working to fix Arch. Now I have only Windows, but I want to use Linux as well, again with dual-boot. :)\n The question is what Linux distro would you recommend for dual-boot? I want something to help me understand how Linux works ( not ones that are 99% like Windows and etc. ) and if possible suitable for gaming. Thank you in advance!! :) \n P. S. \n If you're wondering why in the world I still want to use Windows the answer is Lenovo Vantage. My laptop is Lenovo Legion 5 pro and that app helps me to configure everything on my laptop, especially GPU Mode (Hybrid mode, dGPU mode, etc. ).\n    submitted by    /u/BitLegend31  \n [link]   [comments]",

My choice was the Galaxy Book S - but my nightmare started when I arrived home and tried to install Ubuntu on it. For some reason, the installer couldn't recognize any disk, and the same issue appeared over and over, no matter which distro I tried to use. \n After some research I found out that this model does not use a regular SSD, but an eUFS instead (I've never heard about it before, apparently it is often used within smartphones). Since then, I'm stuck in Windows. Ubuntu sometimes recognizes it but it's never able to finish installation, the disk always disappears before it.\n Does anyone have any idea of how to solve it? I've been thinking in some way to install just a \"windows-skeleton-alike\" with no visual system, just code, and install a virtual machine with Ubuntu above it, but I'm not sure if this is even a possibility.\n I do not like using Windows at all, and I don't know what to do anymore.

          "description": "从商业化工具开始的探索\n很久以前，我曾经试图用一个工具整合各种需求，即所谓「All in One」，结果却是让工具内部变得臃肿和笨重，后来还是逐渐放弃了。\n现在，我做笔记用的是 Obsidian 和 Notion，任务管理用滴答清单，剪藏管理用 Cubox（都是少数派商店里面的好货）。这样将需求拆解到不同工具之后，很多复杂脚本被现成功能取代，工作确实简单了一些。但相应的代价则是需要在工具之间跳转，而它们的协作缺乏了一些「灵性」。\n针对这种问题，市场上出现了许多基于 API 的自动化平台，试图让用户以较低门槛打通不同应用。这其中的行业领先者包括 Zapier 和 IFTTT 等，都是少数派读者耳熟能详的，在少数派上也有不少关的深度教程，例如：\n  \n经过检索，我发现在 AI 兴起之后，很多这类服务都快速添加了调用 OpenAI API 的功能。但是它们有一个共同的缺点（或者是我自己的缺点……），就是太贵了。可以对比一下此类产品的价格：\n产品\n                价格\n            \nZapier\n                免费用户每月 100 次任务。最低升级价格 $20/月，含 750 次任务\n            \nIFTTT\n                免费用户可保存 3 个自动化（Applets）。含有 AI 功能的升级方案升级 $5/月\n            \n集简云\n                免费用户每月 500 次执行。升级一年 ￥1990，每月可执行 1500 次\n            \nHiFlow（腾讯轻联）\n                免费用户每月 1000 次执行。升级一年 ￥980，每月 3000 次\n            \n原则上，我是非常支持为互联网企业的创新功能付费的，但是日常用户的需求并没有强烈到能支撑这种价格。特别是 Zapier，已经像是「轻奢品」的范畴了。\n本文中，我将介绍自己如何搭建开源、可自建的自动化工具 n8n，并演示几个真实用例。在此基础上，我将对用自动化工具辅助工作的未来提出一些展望，以及就个人如何跟进这新的一轮「产业革命」提出些小小看法。\n在经历一系列摸索之后，我最终找到了一个可用且免费的替代品——n8n。\nn8n 是一个开源的自动化控制台。它具有设计简洁的图形界面，可以非常清晰地展示数据在各种服务之间流动的过程。对于入门用户，n8n 提供了丰富的模板，也有活跃的社区支持。\n\nn8n 提供官方托管服务，定价也不便宜。但得益于开源属性，可以比较方便地在自己的 NAS 或 VPS 上部署，从而不需要任何额外开销。\n用 Docker Compose 安装 n8n\nn8n 的安装方式有多种选择，我选择的是 Docker Compose 方案，这也是一种比较容易上手的方案。（下面的步骤假定读者掌握基本的终端操作，且已经安装好 Docker。）\n[ 编注：我们之前会员文章介绍过的 YunoHost 也可以快速安装 n8n。]\n[......]\n查看全文\n本文为会员文章，出自《单篇文章》，订阅后可阅读全文。",

          "description": "Pirate Enlightenment, or the Real Libertalia by David Graeber, Allen Lane,  January 2023, 208pp\n\n如果大卫·格雷伯在你心目中是一位无政府主义活动家，“占领华尔街”运动的精神领袖，或者是2018年那本《毫无意义的工作》（Bullshit Jobs）的挥斥方遒的作者，你可能会惊讶地发现，他还写过一本关于海盗和政治思想的书，以十八世纪的马达加斯加（位于非洲东海岸外的巨大岛屿，大约有两个半英国那么大）为背景。\n事实上，《海盗启蒙》标志着这位著名的人类学家回归了他最初的兴趣。格雷伯于两年前去世，在他还是一名在读研究生时，曾经花了几年时间去马达加斯加做田野考察。他勾搭上一位当地妇女后，发现她认为自己属于一个独特的族群，其成员的祖先可以追溯到加勒比海盗，这激发了他的兴趣。\n后来他在大英图书馆发现了一份未曾发表过的十九世纪初手稿，其中收录了一位法国冒险家所描述的马达加斯加复杂的内部历史的片段。该手稿以一位名为拉齐米拉霍（Ratsimilaho）的传奇人物为中心，这位年轻的战士是一名英国海盗与一名马达加斯加妇女的儿子，在十八世纪初他成为了一场长达十年的战争中的领袖，建立了历史上的贝奇米萨拉卡（Betsimisaraka）邦联——位于马达加斯加东北海岸的一个庞大而崭新的政治实体。\n几十年来格雷伯一直围着这份手稿的一个副本打转，但直到他生命的最后阶段，才最终坐下来仔细处理其内容。其成果就是这本篇幅不长但引人入胜的书，之前已经出版了法文和意大利文版。\n曾活跃于加勒比海的英国海盗从1690年代开始在马达加斯加北部建立基地，方便他们劫掠。1695年，亨利·艾弗里（又名艾维里）及其船员攻击了一支前往麦加的莫卧儿帝国船队，并俘虏了其中两艘满载财富的船只，从而获得了价值六十万英镑（按今天的币值计算约为一亿英镑）的巨额财宝。\n英国和法国政府最终成功打击了这种行径。艾弗里失踪了，其他数百名海盗则退至马达加斯加。逍遥法外的白人亡命徒在某个非洲岛屿上建立个人领地的想法令当时的欧洲人兴奋不已。从伦敦到莫斯科，各国政府都在与所谓的艾弗里的使者进行条约谈判，此时在传言中艾弗里已经成为马达加斯加的海盗国王。当时许多流行说法都是对他行径的描述与发挥。\n丹尼尔·笛福就是被此类故事所吸引的人之一。在他出版《鲁滨逊漂流记》的几年后，一本名为《海盗通史》的书于1724年在伦敦上市，可能就是他写的。书中描述了一个奉行平等主义的马达加斯加海盗共和国，名为利伯塔利亚（Libertalia）——一个乌托邦殖民地，由思想自由、生活自由的自由海盗组成，致力于贯彻平等主义，人民直接管治。\n格雷伯承认，这种说法被广泛认为是一个寓言，而且关于海盗和当地人在三百年前的马达加斯加究竟如何生活，现存的证据少之又少。但他并未因此而退缩。总体上来说，他的任务是论证我们如何看待欧洲启蒙运动从现在已经被遗忘的非欧洲思想家和社会实践中获得的诸多灵感。他推测，贝奇米萨拉卡邦联可以说某种程度上是现实中的利伯塔利亚，“海盗管治和马达加斯加传统政治文化中一些更具平等主义元素的创造性综合”。\n他对这一论点的阐述涉及对马达加斯加政治、性别和社会历史的人类学文献的冗长解析。遗憾的是，格雷伯的论述也夸大了海盗式社会关系的先进性，称其具有真正的革命意义。例如，当笛福描述海盗社区通过抽签选择十二个人来解决争端时，格雷伯兴奋地将此吹嘘为他们新颖的“民主制度”的证据，据说是基于海盗船上独特的平等主义环境。他没有注意到的是，这段描述仅仅是对众所周知的陪审团审判原则的翻版，笛福当年的读者肯定会发现这一点。\n\n《万物的黎明》英文书影\n\n和他最近与大卫·温格罗（David Wengrow）合著的《万物的黎明：人类的新历史》（The Dawn of Everything: A New History of Humanity）一样（那本书在更大的范围内提出了相关的论点），读格雷伯的主要乐趣并不在于要同意他的论点。相反，他通过一系列挑衅性的思想实验，一再迫使我们重新思考我们在当下的生活方式。无论十八世纪的马达加斯加发生过什么，《海盗启蒙》意味着，在我们自己的社会、性别与政治安排中，必然能够更进一步地贯彻自由思考和平等主义。\n（本文英文原文发表于2023年1月27日《卫报》，由作者授权翻译发表）",

S. 艾略特和王尔德等人的观点的精准讨论也使该书具有以“文化”观念为中心的思想史色彩。而伊格尔顿的流畅、恣肆不羁的文风也使阅读带有了另类快感。对我来说，由于同时在阅读弗里茨·斯特恩（Fritz Richard Oskar Stern）的《非自由主义的失败：论现代德国政治文化》（孟钟捷译，商务印书馆，2015年5月），正在思考的是著名的近现代史难题“德国问题”中文化与政治的复杂关系、权力与文化之争、文明与文化之争、从文化政治走向政治文化的路径等议题，因此对伊格尔顿的《论文化》更多关注的是其中文化与政治的论述。在当下的思想与学术场域中，无论我们对伊格尔顿的理论体系及具体论点有何不同看法，他的鲜活与敏锐的批判性气质仍然是很有感染力的。\n作者在“序言”中讲了本书的论述方法：鉴于“文化”这个概念的多层次使其很难被高度统一地展开描述，因此他采取的是围绕“文化”这个主题的多侧面论述。从全书内容议题来说，该书第一章首先讨论了“文化”与“文明”在概念、内涵和使用语境等方面的联系与区别。这一部分在我看来非常适合作为文明史与文化史导论课程的开篇语，可以启发学生从一开始就以开阔的观念与语言学视野思考历史叙事体系的建构与核心概念的复杂联系。…",

          "description": "《天赐之日》，[荷兰]高罗佩著，张凌译，上海译文出版社2023年4月出版，184页，45.00元\n\n众所周知，荷兰汉学家高罗佩（Robert Hans van Gulik，1910-1967）以其融中国公案与西方侦探于一体的《大唐狄公案》闻名世界，该系列悬疑小说是以唐代政治家狄仁杰（字怀英，630-700）为主角，作者虚构了他破案、断案的故事。但很少有人知道，1964 年，也即高氏去世前三年，他还出版了《天赐之日》（The Given Day）——一部几乎完全摒弃狄公系列小说创作风格的黑帮犯罪小说，尽管依旧有一个以正压邪的结局和令男主人公心旌摇曳的美女配角，但作者对故事人物、场景、题材、结构等均作了较大创新，正如荷兰小说家与评论家扬威廉（Janwillem Van de Wetering，1931-2008）在“后记”中所云，此书是高罗佩试图将其“荷兰性”与他在远东接触到的禅学调和起来的尝试。至于这一尝试是否成功，众说纷纭、见仁见智。本文意在展现《天赐之日》对狄公系列小说的新变，并进一步剖析高氏离开狄公赐予的舒适圈，涉足一个从未尝试过的新领域的原因。\n相较于《大唐狄公案》，《天赐之日》并非探案小说，而是较为典型的西方犯罪小说，一般来讲，犯罪小说的创作宗旨在于塑造社会共同的道德体系，用紧张刺激的阅读体验、推理解谜的思维乐趣和惩恶扬善的正义主题引导人们遵守法律、和谐相处。但《天赐之日》突破了这一传统主旨，意在彰显更高精神层面的超拔。为达到这一目的，高公首先挣脱了狄公的束缚，为《天赐之日》带来了诸多具有鲜明西方性和现代性的新变。\n首先是主人公之变。《天赐之日》由唐武周时期的著名政治家狄仁杰变身为前殖民地也即荷属东印度政府官员约翰·亨德里克斯，前者是满腹经纶、清正廉洁、才德卓绝的“斗南一人”；后者则是爪哇某城的地区副主管和巡回法官，二战期间失去妻女及一切的日军战俘，战后身无长物的老…",

          "description": "社区批评 Meta 滥用“开源”来称呼其新大语言模型\n\r\nMeta AI 宣称：“Llama 2 是我们的下一代开源 LLM，可用于研究和商业用途”。但事实上 Llama 2 并没有使用 OSI（开源计划）批准的许可证，也不符合 OSD（开源定义）。其社区协议禁止使用 Llama 2 训练其他语言模型；如果在月活用户超过 7 亿的应用程序或服务中使用该技术，比如那些大公司，则需要获得 Meta 的特殊许可。对于程序员来说，可能是否“开源”并不要紧，他们能够用它来搭建和研究就够了。对于 Meta 高层来说，“开源”被他们当成了一个营销用语，但是这显然会让人对“开源”一词产生混淆。\n\r\n\r\n消息来源：The Register\n\r\n\r\n\r\n老王点评：我不觉得 Meta 不知道什么是“开源”，但是这种草率编写的许可协议，显然代表了 Meta 既想借开源的模式打狼，又担心开源反而赔了孩子。这种首鼠两端的想法最后不会有好结果。\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n人工智能公司承诺将为人工智能生成内容打上水印\n\r\nOpenAI、Alphabet、Meta、亚马逊和微软等七家主要的美国人工智能公司，承诺开发一个系统来 “标记” 文本、图像、音频、视频等所有形式的人工智能生成的内容，这样用户就能知道什么时候使用了这项技术。这种以技术方式嵌入内容的水印，会让用户更容易发现深度伪造的图像或音频。他们还承诺在发布新的人工智能系统前进行彻底地测试，并分享诸如如何降低风险等信息。\n\r\n\r\n消息来源：路透社\n\r\n\r\n\r\n老王点评：这真的能做到到么？或者说，这种水印能被其它人工智能系统去掉吧。更不要说还有开源的人工智能系统。\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\nCerebras 推出人工智能超级计算机网络\n\r\nCerebras 公司推出了 Condor Galaxy 项目，这是一个由九台相互连接的超级计算机组成的网络，专为人工智能模型训练而设计，总性能达到 36 FP16 ExaFLOP。其中第一台超级计算机 CG-1 是由 64 台 Cerebras CS-2 系统整合而成，有 5400 万个内核，能够为人工智能训练提供 4 ExaFLOP 的算力。它支持多达 6000 亿个参数的模型，其配置可扩展至支持多达 100 万亿个参数。其它几台将陆续建设。该公司 CEO 称，“许多云计算公司都宣布了耗资数十亿美元建造的大规模 GPU 集群，但这些集群却极难使用。将一个模型分布到数千个微小的 GPU 上，需要数十名具有罕见专业知识的人员花费数月的时间。CG-1 消除了这一挑战。建立一个生成式人工智能模型只需要几分钟，而不是几个月，而且一个人就能完成。”\n\r\n\r\n消息来源：Anand Tech\n\r\n\r\n\r\n老王点评：算力不是问题，将来的人工智能系统才是问题。这样大量训练出来的人工智能系统，真的能按照人们最善良的愿望去发展吗？",

          "description": "IMAX 电影播放仍然需要一台 21 年前的掌上电脑\n\r\n在《奥本海默》上映之前，IMAX TikTok 官方账号发布的一段视频中，有一个小小的蓝银色 Palm 设备。它是在另一台设备上运行的 Palm Pilot 模拟器，安装在放置卷轴的机器旁边的白色柱子上。这个仿真的设备是 Palm m130，于 2002 年发布。它有一个两英寸的 160x160 显示屏，采用 33MHz 的摩托罗拉处理器，运行 Palm OS 4.1 系统。在 IMAX 影院中，该掌上电脑的工作是控制快转卷轴装置，多年来，在大多数 IMAX 影院里，似乎都有一个实体 m130。IMAX 为什么还要在 21 年前的设备上运行其系统？又为什么会选择在一台蹩脚的 Windows 平板电脑上简单地模拟这台 21 年前的设备呢？因为，放映员们已经习惯了它的存在。\n\r\n\r\n消息来源：The Verge\n\r\n\r\n\r\n老王点评：2000 年时，我用过早期 Palm，却没想到在二十几年后 Palm 仍然在用。\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n特斯拉开始生产可以媲美超算榜首的 Dojo 超级计算机\n\r\n特斯拉在 2023 年第二季度财报中概述了大规模解决车辆自动驾驶问题所需的四大技术支柱：超大型真实世界数据集、神经网络训练、车辆硬件和车辆软件。特斯拉表示，它已经开始生产用于训练其自动驾驶车队的 Dojo 超级计算机，该计算机宣布于 2019 年。特斯拉已经拥有一台基于英伟达 GPU 的大型超级计算机，它是世界上最强大的超级计算机之一，但新的 Dojo 定制计算机使用的是特斯拉设计的芯片。此前，马斯克曾宣称，Dojo 的运算能力将达到 1 ExaFLOP。目前，据公开披露的信息，美国橡树岭国家实验室的超级计算机 Frontier 是全球首台达到 ExaFLOP 级别的计算机，也是唯一一台。\n\r\n\r\n消息来源：The Verge\n\r\n\r\n\r\n老王点评：虽然可能还需要一年时间，但是特斯拉能从芯片到贴片、托盘、机架，乃至于构成一个集群，其计算实力不容小觑。\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\nAMI 固件中发现影响数百万计算机的严重漏洞\n\r\n这些漏洞是在 AMI 为 BMC（底板管理控制器）制作的固件中发现的，BMC 是集成在服务器主板上的小型计算机，可以远程管理多台计算机。可以访问 Redfish 远程管理接口的本地或远程攻击者可以利用这些漏洞，导致未经授权的访问、远程代码执行和服务器的潜在物理损坏。这一漏洞使其能够在世界上一些最敏感的云环境中获得超级用户身份。在那里，攻击者可以安装勒索软件和间谍恶意软件，在受感染机器的最底层运行。成功的攻击者还可能对服务器造成物理损坏或无限期重启循环。\n\r\n\r\n消息来源：Ars Technica\n\r\n\r\n\r\n老王点评：在支持远程管理的固件上出现的安全漏洞，那才叫一个防不胜防。",

          "description": "现存最古老的发行版 Slackware 已经 30 岁了\n\r\n本周，Slackware Linux 项目庆祝其成立 30 周年。Slackware 1.0 版本于 1993 年 7 月 16 日发布，它是目前仍在积极维护和开发的最古老的 Linux 发行版，虽然它不是第一个 Linux 发行版。最让人敬佩的是，其创始人至今仍在维护该项目。他说，“这真的是一段非凡的旅程，我在 1993 年开始时根本无法预料。”当前版本 Slackware 15 于 2021 年进入测试阶段，并于去年初发布。顺便说一句，MCC Interim Linux 可以说是第一个发行版，它的第一个候选版本 0.97 在 1991 年内核发布几个月后就出现了。Debian 比 Slackware 稍微年轻一点，是在 Slackware 发布两个月后发布的。\n\r\n\r\n消息来源：The Register\n\r\n\r\n\r\n老王点评：Slackware 是我用过的第一个 Linux 发行版，那应该是 1997 年或 1998 年。而我那时最喜欢的发行版是 Mandrake。\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n黑客之王凯文·米特尼克去世\n\r\n凯文·米特尼克Kevin Mitnick，曾被称为 “世界头号通缉黑客”，于上周日去世，享年 59 岁。他曾因侵入和篡改公司计算机网络而入狱服刑，2000 年获释后开始了新的职业生涯，担任安全顾问、作家和公共演讲人。他最为人熟知的是 20 世纪 90 年代的疯狂犯罪，当时他从美国各地的电脑中窃取了成千上万的数据文件和信用卡号码。他利用自己的技能进入美国的电话和手机网络，破坏政府、企业和大学的计算机系统。1995 年，经过长达两年多的追捕，他被美国联邦调查局抓获。\n\r\n\r\n消息来源：Engadget\n\r\n\r\n\r\n老王点评：这是一个传奇，虽然是那种以破坏为目的的“黑客”，但依然是传奇的一生。\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n苹果正在开发自己的人工智能大模型\n\r\n据报道，苹果正在开发自己的大语言模型以及类似 ChatGPT 的 AI 工具。苹果的大模型代号 “Ajax”，苹果还创建了一个聊天机器人服务，一些工程师称之为 “Apple GPT”。苹果有多个团队在 AI 项目上展开合作，它已成为苹果的一大重要工作。苹果员工表示这项工作基本上是对 Bard、ChatGPT 的复制，并不包含任何新功能或新技术。苹果正在积极改进模型，但目前没有向消费者发布的计划。\n\r\n\r\n消息来源：彭博社\n\r\n\r\n\r\n老王点评：苹果在这一点上已经大大落后，不知道什么时候它的 Siri 才可以变聪明。",

          "description": "本章将介绍如何在 Bash Shell 脚本中使用数组。学习添加元素、删除元素和获取数组长度。\n\r\n\r\n在本系列的前面部分中，你了解了变量。变量中可以有单个值。\n\r\n数组内部可以有多个值。当你必须一次处理多个变量时，这会使事情变得更容易。你不必将各个值存储在新变量中。\n\r\n因此，不要像这样声明五个变量：\n\r\ndistro1=Ubuntu\r\ndistro2=Fedora\r\ndistro3=SUSE\r\ndistro4=Arch Linux\r\ndistro5=Nix\r\n\n\r\n你可以在单个数组中初始化它们所有：\n\r\ndistros=(Ubuntu Fedora SUSE \"Arch Linux\" Nix)\r\n\n\r\n与其他一些编程语言不同，你不使用逗号作为数组元素分隔符。\n\r\n那挺好的。让我们看看如何访问数组元素。\n\r\n在 Bash 中访问数组元素\n\r\n使用索引（数组中的位置）访问数组元素。要访问索引 N 处的数组元素，请使用：\n\r\n${array_name[N]}\r\n\n\r\n\r\n💡 与大多数其他编程语言一样，Bash Shell 中的数组从索引 0 开始。这意味着第一个元素的索引为 0，第二个元素的索引为 1，第 n 个元素的索引为 n-1。\n\r\n\r\n因此，如果你想打印 SUSE，你将使用：\n\r\necho ${distros[2]}\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n🚧 ${ 之后或 } 之前不能有任何空格。你不能像 ${ array[n] } 那样使用它。\n\r\n\r\n一次访问所有数组元素\n\r\n假设你要打印数组的所有元素。\n\r\n你可以一一使用 echo ${array[n]} 但这确实没有必要。有一个更好更简单的方法：\n\r\n${array[*]}\r\n\n\r\n这将为你提供所有数组元素。\n\r\n\n\r\n在 Bash 中获取数组长度\n\r\n如何知道数组中有多少个元素？ 有一个专门的方法 在 Bash 中获取数组长度：\n\r\n${#array_name[@]}\r\n\n\r\n就这么简单，对吧？\n\r\n\n\r\n在 Bash 中添加数组元素\n\r\n如果必须向数组添加其他元素，请使用 += 运算符 将元素追加到 Bash 中的现有数组：\n\r\narray_name+=(\"new_value\")\r\n\n\r\n这是一个例子：\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n🚧 追加元素时使用 () 很重要。\n\r\n\r\n你还可以使用索引将元素设置在任何位置。\n\r\narray_name[N]=new_value\r\n\n\r\n但请记住使用正确的索引编号。 如果在现有索引上使用它，新值将替换该元素。\n\r\n如果你使用“越界”索引，它仍会添加到最后一个元素之后。例如，如果数组长度为 6，并且你尝试在索引 9 处设置新值，则该值仍将作为最后一个元素添加到第 7 个位置（索引 6）。\n\r\n\n\r\n删除数组元素\n\r\n你可以使用 Shell 内置的 unset 通过提供索引号来删除数组元素：\n\r\nunset array_name[N]\r\n\n\r\n这是一个示例，我删除了数组的第四个元素。\n\r\n\n\r\n你还可以通过 unset 来删除整个数组：\n\r\nunset array_name\r\n\n\r\n\r\n💡 Bash 中没有严格的数据类型规则。你可以创建一个同时包含整数和字符串的数组。\n\r\n\r\n🏋️ 练习时间\n\r\n让我们练习一下你所学到的有关 Bash 数组的知识。\n\r\n练习 1：创建一个 Bash 脚本，其中包含五个最佳 Linux 发行版的数组。全部打印出来。\n\r\n现在，用 “Hannah Montanna Linux” 替换中间的选择。\n\r\n练习 2：创建一个 Bash 脚本，该脚本接受用户提供的三个数字，然后以相反的顺序打印它们。\n\r\n预期输出：\n\r\nEnter three numbers and press enter\r\n12 23 44\r\nNumbers in reverse order are: 44 23 12\r\n\n\r\n我希望你喜欢通过本系列学习 Bash Shell 脚本。在下一章中，你将学习如何使用 if-else。敬请关注。\n\r\n（题图：MJ/09477e2f-2bf9-4fdf-bc1e-c894a068adf2）\n\r\n\r\nvia: https://itsfoss.com/bash-arrays/\n\r\n作者：Abhishek Prakash 选题：lkxed 译者：geekpi 校对：wxy\n\r\n本文由 LCTT 原创编译，Linux中国 荣誉推出",

          "description": "Meta 发布新大语言模型，可免费商用，采用特别的“开源”方式\n\r\nMeta 周二发布了 Llama 2：这是一套经过预训练和微调的基于文本的人工智能模型，有三种不同的规模，分别包含 70 亿、130 亿和 700 亿个参数。与之前的 LLaMA 模型不同的是，任何人都可以申请下载 Llama 2，开发人员可以用它来构建商业产品或服务，以及开展有趣的项目。Meta 表示，不会对访问或使用其开发的模型收费，而是通过向其他公司开放该技术，如与微软和亚马逊合作，在 Azure 和 AWS 上提供该模型。值得注意的是，Llama 2 采用了专门的 许可证，有一些独特的限制，因此不符合“开源”的定义。除了常见的免责声明外，开发人员不能利用其输出结果来改进其他类型的大型语言模型。以及，如果将 Llama 2 用于支持那些拥有超过 7 亿月活跃用户的应用程序的大公司，必须申请使用 Meta 技术的特殊许可。\n\r\n\r\n消息来源：The Register\n\r\n\r\n\r\n老王点评：虽然不是规范定义的“开源”软件，但至少是开放的。值得注意但是，从 LLaMA 到 Llama 2，Meta 都采用了非同寻常的“开源”方式，这或许是 Meta 既想利用开源的优势，又有一些不确定的担忧。也许人工智能领域需要一种独特的开放许可证。\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n美国启动物联网安全标签计划\n\r\n该计划的正式名称为《美国网络信任标识》，旨在帮助美国人确保他们购买的互联网连接设备具有强大的网络安全保护措施，可防范网络攻击。长期以来，物联网一直被认为是网络安全的薄弱环节。符合该标准的设备将要求具有唯一且强大的默认密码、保护存储和传输的数据、提供定期的安全更新以及具备事故检测能力等。\n\r\n\r\n消息来源：Tech Crunch\n\r\n\r\n\r\n老王点评：越来越多的物联网设备，其实是埋在信息社会底层的空洞，你不知道它什么时候就会导致塌陷。\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n印度大部分外包程序员将在两年内因人工智能而消失\n\r\nStability AI 公司的 CEO 表示，印度的大多数外包程序员将在未来一两年内失业。不过他认为，在法国等受《劳动法》保护较强的国家受到这种影响的可能性较小。他重申了他之前的说法，五年后将 “不再有程序员”，不过，他也说明，他指的是传统意义上的程序员。他说，“当你把编程这件事从错误测试、单元测试到构思进行解构时，人工智能可以做到这一点，而且做得更好。但这不是自动完成的，而是人工智能‘辅助驾驶’完成的。”\n\r\n\r\n消息来源：CNBC\n\r\n\r\n\r\n老王点评：其实也不用特别慌，就像计算器、计算机出现，并没有让原来的财务和文员失业一样，只是如果你掌握不了新工具，那这种“古典程序员”被淘汰也是自然的。",

          "description": "当你开始在桌面上使用 Linux 时，你可能会选择像 Ubuntu 或者 Linux Mint 这样的 对初学者友好的发行版。\n\r\n随着你逐渐熟悉 Linux 并且开始喜欢上它，你会加入各种社交渠道上的 Linux 相关社区，关注分享 Linux 内容的网站。而当你这样做的时候，你也会发现一些新的、相对不知名的发行版。\n\r\n因为你对这个领域还比较陌生，你可能会被诱惑尝试一个接一个的发行版，从而陷入“发行版快闪”的陷阱。\n\r\n\n\r\n于是你开始问自己这个问题：“我应该使用一个未知的发行版，还是像大多数人那样使用流行的发行版呢”？\n\r\n简单的答案是坚持使用主流的发行版，但真正的答案需要你自己思考。\n\r\n使用新的、较为冷门的发行版存在的问题\n\r\n使用“全新的、个人开发者的发行版”存在一个主要问题，那就是不确定性。你无法确定这个项目将会存在多久。可能是一年，也可能是一个月。\n\r\n我曾经见过几个发行版出现这种情况。比如，SemiCode OS 由于为程序员而创建而变得流行。类似的发行版 Emperor OS 最近消失了。这只是被停止开发的发行版长列表中的几个例子。\n\r\n你可能会说，一个有一定用户基础的旧发行版也可能出现同样的情况。这是对的，但通常情况下，有一个社区和多个开发者参与项目。这样你就有一定的保证。\n\r\n由于开发者的经验不足，新的发行版可能会缺失关键功能。例如，在撰写本文时，看起来令人惊艳的 Garuda Linux 官方并不推荐双启动。\n\r\n\n\r\n尽管 Garuda Linux 拥有相当数量的支持者和几名开发者参与项目，但仍存在这个问题。\n\r\n大多数新的发行版没有提供实质性的内容\n\r\n你经常会遇到一些全新的发行版，它们基于一些其他流行的发行版，比如 Ubuntu 或 Arch Linux。唯一的不同可能只在于默认的应用程序、主题和壁纸。\n\r\n如果它是一个“面向程序员的发行版”，它可能会默认安装一些编程应用程序。如果它是一个“游戏发行版”，它可能会默认安装一些工具，如 Steam、Wine 和 Lutris。你不太可能在图形或硬件方面看到真正的优化。\n\r\n这就是为什么很多人说，已经有了数百个发行版的拥挤空间中，我们不需要更多的发行版。毕竟，在主流发行版中安装所需的应用程序并不难。\n\r\n我反对这些新的发行版吗？\n\r\n绝对不是。\n\r\n你可能会觉得几乎没有提供任何价值的新发行版是多余的。你可能是对的，因为这些项目可能对你来说无关紧要，但对于开发它的人来说，它们是重要的。\n\r\n你有没有试过学习一门编程语言？第一个教程通常是一个“Hello World”的程序。即便是高级程序员也是从“Hello World”开始的。\n\r\n婴儿不会直接开始跑步。到达那个阶段需要时间。\n\r\n我对这些项目的看法也是一样的。如果有人热爱 Linux 并且对创建自己的“操作系统”感到兴奋，就让他们去做吧。如果你不想鼓励他们，也不要泼冷水。\n\r\n大多数项目都是从相同的方式开始的。Linux Mint 是一款非常受欢迎的 Linux 发行版。它于 2006 年开始，并以 Kubuntu 为基础。\n\r\n真的需要“一个基于 Ubuntu 的类似发行版”吗？实际上并不需要。但看看 Linux Mint 如今的地位。\n\r\n那么，你应该使用新的发行版还是不应该使用呢？\n\r\n总体而言，这取决于你自己。\n\r\n如果你不喜欢频繁格式化你的系统，并且希望继续正常生活，那就坚持使用主流的发行版。\n\r\n如果你喜欢实验，不介意频繁更换操作系统并且愿意冒着搞乱系统的风险，那么你可以尝试新的发行版。就个人而言，我建议你在虚拟机中尝试它们。如果你能有一台空闲的系统专门用于实验，那就更好了。\n\r\n你也可以使用那些在社区中存在多年，但不如 Ubuntu、Mint、Fedora 和 Debian 等发行版流行的发行版。像 PCLinuxOS、Puppy Linux、Peppermint OS 等项目拥有一个较小但活跃的社区。它们绝对是一个可靠的选择，即使用于你的主系统也没有问题。\n\r\n在选择发行版时，除了基础发行版外，你还应该看看该发行版是否经常更新，并拥有一个活跃的社区。你只需要查看该项目的论坛，看看社区中是否有足够的活动即可。\n\r\n你更喜欢哪种类型的发行版？\n\r\n这是我在选择新的较为冷门发行版和流行的主流发行版之间提出的想法和建议。\n\r\n那你呢？你更喜欢哪种类型的发行版？\n\r\n（题图：MJ/930988c0-443d-4d61-a603-1466a5e33d85）\n\r\n\r\nvia: https://news.itsfoss.com/obscure-or-maintsream-distro/\n\r\n作者：Abhishek 选题：lujun9972 译者：ChatGPT 校对：wxy\n\r\n本文由 LCTT 原创编译，Linux中国 荣誉推出",

          "description": "开源硬件公司正在向封闭转变\n\r\n在过去 15 年里，创新型电子公司设计并发布了数以千计的开源硬件设计，创造了一个蓬勃发展的产业。他们还集体创作并签署了《开源硬件定义》，为这些产品给出了明确的定义和标准。然而，最近一些开源硬件公司要么封闭源代码，要么推迟发布源代码，要么要求签订 NDA 才能获得“开源”的硬件及其软件。去年悄悄完成 3200 万美元融资的开源硬件公司 Arduino 修改了自己的开源承诺，删除了 “所有 Arduino 板都是完全开源的，……软件也是开源的……” 的话语。SparkFun 采用了闭源固件，需要 NDA 才能查看其代码，并申请撤销其销售的一款产品的开源硬件认证。开源 3D 打印公司 Prusa 以开源名义销售的产品，由于担忧“克隆品”而一直没有发布相应的源代码，并指责中国制造商利用其设计和源代码制造专有的闭源产品，还对从他们的开源代码中获取的设计和算法申请专利。\n\r\n\r\n消息来源：Adafruit\n\r\n\r\n\r\n老王点评：无论是开源软件，还是开源硬件，资本一旦涉入，开源的味道就会变化。很多靠开源起家的公司，最后背离开源，或许无奈，或许是主动选择。开源的理念，可能他们自己也不一定真心相信。\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n人工智能检测器认为《美国宪法》是由人工智能编写的\n\r\n尽管依靠人工智能工具来检测人工智能生成的作文很有诱惑力，但迄今为止的证据表明，这些工具并不可靠。由于存在假阳性，GPTZero、ZeroGPT 和 OpenAI 自己的文本分类器等人工智能写作检测器无法检测由 ChatGPT 等大型语言模型组成的文本。如果你将美国最重要的法律文件《美国宪法》输入这种检测工具中，它会告诉你该文件几乎肯定是由人工智能撰写的。同样的情况也发生在《圣经》选段中。\n\r\n\r\n消息来源：Ars Technica\n\r\n\r\n\r\n老王点评：简单来说，这些人工智能的模型就是基于这些成例的文本训练而成的，自然无法区别这些事实上由人撰写的文件，而认为这些文本和人工智能生成的非常相近。这篇来源详细介绍了更多细节，感兴趣的话可以看看。\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n出现用于网络犯罪的人工智能 WormGPT\n\r\n以 OpenAI 聊天机器人 ChatGPT 为代表的生成式 AI 能生成类似人类的文本，网络罪犯可利用它自动创建高度可信的钓鱼邮件，对收件人高度定制，增加攻击的成功率。网络罪犯甚至创建了专门用于恶意目的的工具 WormGPT。WormGPT 是基于 2021 年开发的大模型 GPTJ，它的功能包括无限字符支持、聊天记忆保留和代码格式化等。开发者声称 WormGPT 使用了恶意程序相关的数据进行训练。\n\r\n\r\n消息来源：Slash Next\n\r\n\r\n\r\n老王点评：要是什么地方对新技术的利用最积极，那要数这些可以用来牟利的非法领域了。",

          "description": "AlmaLinux 不再追求与 RHEL 的 1:1 兼容性\n\r\n随着红帽对 RHEL 源代码库的限制访问，虽然 Rocky Linux 已经表示 找到 了继续发布 1:1 克隆品的解决方案，但 AlmaLinux “决定放弃与 RHEL 1:1（兼容）的目标”。退而求其次，AlmaLinux 将在可能的范围内与 RHEL 保持一致并兼容应用二进制接口（ABI），这样在 RHEL 上运行的软件也可以在 AlmaLinux 上运行。对于典型的用户，这将意味着你在使用 AlmaLinux 时几乎不会有什么变化。最大的变化是，AlmaLinux 将不再与红帽保持 “问题级的兼容性”，现在可以接受红帽发布周期之外的问题修复。虽然这意味着一些 AlmaLinux 的用户可能会遇到 RHEL 中没有的问题，但 AlmaLinux 也可能会接受尚未被 RHEL 接受的补丁。\n\r\n\r\n消息来源：Almalinux\n\r\n\r\n\r\n老王点评：这就是红帽的目的吧？最终这些精确克隆品的结果可能都这样吧。但是我很怀疑红帽以后还会给建立 ABI 兼容也制造“没必要提供的”麻烦。\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n好莱坞想要永远免费得到龙套演员的人工智能复制品\n\r\n好莱坞的演员们将要举行一场罢工，主要的原因是好莱坞电影公司的一项以“保护演员的数字肖像权”为名义的人工智能提案。在该提案中，那些经常出现在背景中的龙套演员会被一次性扫描，而电影公司将拥有他们的扫描件、形象、肖像，并且能在他们想要的任何项目中永远使用，无需同意，无需补偿。使用生成式人工智能一直是双方谈判的主要症结之一。组织罢工的演员工会表示，“如果我们现在不站得高一点，我们都会有麻烦，我们都会面临被机器取代的危险。”\n\r\n\r\n消息来源：The Verge\n\r\n\r\n\r\n老王点评：别说是龙套，就是主角和配角，将来都会全是 AI 制品，早晚而已。\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n2027 年欧盟销售的智能手机电池需要可更换\n\r\n6 月中旬，欧洲议会投票通过新立法，要求智能手机等消费设备的电池必须易于拆卸和更换。本周，欧洲理事会正式同意了这项新法规。任何想要在欧盟销售手机的制造商必须确保这些手机在 2027 年之前拥有可更换电池。\n\r\n\r\n消息来源：Android Authority\n\r\n\r\n\r\n老王点评：自从智能手机开始流行，不知道为什么大家就接受了电池不可更换的做法。现在，欧洲带了一个好头。\n\r\n\r\n回音\n\r\n\r\nBcachefs 在进入 Linux 6.5 受阻后，计划两个月 再次尝试 进入 Linux 6.6。",

          "description": "我们评测了最新的 SparkyLinux 7 “Orion Belt”，它带来了最新、最好的 Debian 12 软件包。\n\r\n\r\nSparkyLinux 是著名的基于 Debian 的桌面 Linux 发行版，又推出了它的最新版本 SparkyLinux 7 “Orion Belt”。自 SparkyLinux 6.0 以来，经过近两年的开发，这个主要版本已经发布。这个备受期待的版本结合了 Debian 12 的稳定性优势和 SparkyLinux 的尖端功能，承诺提供卓越的用户体验。\n\r\n让我们深入研究这个主要版本的细节，并了解它的性能和其他发行版方面。\n\r\nSparkyLinux 7 “Orion Belt”\n\r\n核心更新\n\r\nSparkyLinux 以其多样化的桌面风格而脱颖而出，确保适合每个用户。无论你喜欢视觉上令人惊叹的 KDE Plasma、轻量级 LXQt、经典 MATE、可定制的 Xfce 还是简约的 Openbox，SparkyLinux 7 都提供了令人印象深刻的选择，以满足各种喜好和要求。\n\r\nSparkyLinux 7 的核心是 Debian 12 “Bookworm”，为稳定性和可靠性提供了坚实的基础。Debian 12 几天前发布，作为该项目的一个重要里程碑，它是历史上最好的 Debian 版本之一。也就是说，在 SparkyLinux 7 中，用户可以期望从 Debian “Bookworm” 和 Sparky “Orion Belt” 仓库更新所有软件包，确保最新的软件版本随时可用。\n\r\n此版本默认由 Linux 内核 6.1 LTS 提供支持。但是，如果你更喜欢前沿的主线内核，那么你可以在不稳定的仓库中获取 6.3 和 5.15 LTS。\n\r\n\n\r\n增强的应用和软件\n\r\n内置应用堆栈已更新，包括基本应用。你可以使用稳定的 Firefox 102.12 ESR、Thunderbird 102.12、VLC 3.0 和 LibreOffice 7.4 作为关键应用。如果你更喜欢最新的 Firefox，那么可以使用 Firefox 114，它可以在单独的 Sparky 仓库中找到。\n\r\nSparky APTus AppCenter 是一款用于管理软件安装和更新的集成工具，已更新至版本 20230530，增强了用户的便利性。在一项重大更改中，systemd-timesyncd 取代了 ntp 以简化时间同步。\n\r\nSparkyLinux 的旗舰产品 Xfce 桌面版本为 4.18，这是这款轻量级桌面的最新更新版本。此外，你还可以找到其他版本，例如 KDE Plasma 5.27、LXQt 1.2 和 MATE 1.26。\n\r\n该团队还投入了大量精力来改进 amd64 ISO 映像，使其能够在具有 UEFI 主板和启用安全启动的机器上启动，从而扩展了对现代系统的兼容性。\n\r\n那么，关于这个版本的更新就到这里了。我们来看看性能吧。\n\r\n\n\r\n安装和性能\n\r\n我使用 SparkyLinux Xfce 版本进行了本次评测的测试。Calamares 3.2.61 的安装很顺利，没有任何错误。如果你正在安装，你应该注意立付live介质的密码是 “live”，这是启动安装程序所必需的。\n\r\n所有更新脚本（包括欢迎应用）在安装后运行良好。欢迎程序可让你快速访问所有系统信息和桌面功能。\n\r\n我通过 Firefox（运行 YouTube 的 4 个以上选项卡）、文件管理器、绘图应用、终端、VLC、Synaptic 包管理器和 AppCenter 来运行这个版本。资源占用稍高一些。\n\r\n此负载的内存消耗约为 2 GB，CPU 使用率平均约为 2%。SparkyLinux 7（Xfce）默认安装占用 5.2 GB 磁盘空间。\n\r\n所以，总的来说，我相信它运行得相当好，但考虑到 Xfce 桌面，内存消耗似乎有点高。\n\r\n\n\r\n总结\n\r\nSparkyLinux 7 “Orion Belt” 带来了 Debian 的精华，为用户提供稳定性和多功能性的平衡组合。SparkyLinux 凭借其广泛的桌面风格、精选应用和专业版本，可以满足广泛的用户需求。\n\r\n该版本将持续近两年的维护和安全更新。因此，你可以放心地采用它作为你的日常使用。\n\r\n你可以从其 官方网站 下载 SparkyLinux。\n\r\n参考自 发布公告\n\r\n（题图：MJ/2be08f20-13c3-4c3c-bb84-0bf5be77f86c/）\n\r\n\r\nvia: https://www.debugpoint.com/sparkylinux-7-review/\n\r\n作者：Arindam 选题：lkxed 译者：geekpi 校对：wxy\n\r\n本文由 LCTT 原创编译，Linux中国 荣誉推出",

          "description": "中国用人工智能在 5 小时内设计出 RISC-V CPU\n\r\n在一篇由中科院、中科大的研究人员发表的论文中，详细介绍了他们在 5 小时内设计出一个新的工业规模的 RISC-V CPU 的工作。据称，这要比人类团队完成类似的 CPU 设计快 1000 倍左右。该 CPU 的设计是 “仅从外部输入-输出观察中形成的，而不是正式的程序代码”。它还拥有令人印象深刻的 11 个 9 的的准确性。该 CPU 采用 65 纳米制造，可以以高达 300MHz 的速度运行。他们在该 CPU 上运行了 Linux 内核 5.15 的操作系统，基准测试显示该 CPU 性能大约与 i486 相当。研究人员认为，他们“从头发现了冯-诺伊曼架构”。\n\r\n\r\n消息来源：Tom's Hardware\n\r\n\r\n\r\n老王点评：重要的不是设计出来的芯片有多强，而是 AI 可以这么快就完成了芯片设计，而且走了一条不同的设计道路。更好的是，这是国内的团队完成的研究。\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n为什么 Mastodon 无法取代 Twitter\n\r\n即使 Twitter 用户体验多么糟糕，它的老板多么令人讨厌，它的用户仍然留在那里，去中心化微博客替代 Mastodon 未能吸引到更多 Twitter 用户。一位前 Mastodon 实例管理员解释了其中的原因：对于绝大多数用户而言 Mastodon 没有独特的卖点，从功能上讲它本质上是 2008 年的 Twitter，而从功能角度看 2023 年的 Twitter 能让绝大多数用户满意；对 99% 的用户来说去中心化不是卖点，就像绝大多数用户不在意开源或自由软件，在意识形态上也不反对私有软件；去中心化让用户体验糟糕；管理 Mastodon 的人对现状感到满意，他们认为其他人只需要接受就行，新用户无法将他们的体验反馈给管理者，他们会选择离开；Mastodon 扩展性不行，其用户群只接受慈善不接受其它任何资助模式；在很大程度上，Mastodon 的文化是排外的。\n\r\n\r\n消息来源：Solidot\n\r\n\r\n\r\n老王点评：去中心化并不是灵丹妙药，甚至我觉得它可能会一直处于非主流，虽然它的存在是非常必要的。\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n谷歌决定不支付加拿大的“链接税”\n\r\n加拿大通过了《在线新闻法》，要求谷歌和 Facebook 为简单地显示新闻链接付费，而其他人都是免费的。谷歌和 Facebook 都拒绝了加拿大的要求，它们都决定从其平台上删除加拿大的新闻内容。谷歌称，“对链接进行定价（所谓的‘链接税’）的史无前例的决定，为我们的产品带来了不确定性，并使我们仅仅因为方便加拿大人获取加拿大出版商的新闻而面临不设上限的财务责任。”谷歌在 2021 年 1 月对澳大利亚的 “链接税” 法律采取了类似的立场，但谷歌在几周后就同意为澳大利亚的新闻付费。此外，谷歌还同意向法国新闻网站支付费用。而美国也正在制定类似的法律。\n\r\n\r\n消息来源：Ars Technica\n\r\n\r\n\r\n老王点评：看来“吃大户”的想法哪里都有，就像还有些人准备让大型 IT 公司额外负担光缆的费用一样。但是从另外一个方面看，似乎这些具有垄断性质的 IT 巨头，应该承担更多的责任和付出。你怎么看呢？",

This incident will be reported.\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n本文旨在提供有关在 Debian 中向 SUDOERS 组添加用户的分步指南，确保你可以有效地管理用户权限和系统安全。\n\r\n如何将用户添加到 Debian 中的 SUDOERS 组\n\r\n要将用户添加到 Debian 中的 SUDOERS 组，请按照以下简单步骤操作：\n\r\n\r\n单击“终端”图标或使用快捷键 Ctrl+Alt+T，打开 Debian 系统上的终端。\n\r\n使用以下命令切换到 root 用户：\n\r\n\r\nsu -\r\n\n\r\n系统将提示你提供 root 密码。输入 root 密码并按回车键。\n\r\n以 root 用户身份登录后，输入以下命令。确保根据你的用户名进行更改。在此示例中，将 arindam 替换为你的用户名。\n\r\n/sbin/addgroup arindam sudo\r\n\n\r\n如果上面的命令无效，还可以使用下面的命令：\n\r\nusermod -aG sudo arindam\r\n\n\r\n按退出离开 root 提示符。注销并重新登录。现在你可以使用你的用户名执行任何管理操作。\n\r\n另一种方法\n\r\n你可以使用与下面相同的命令进入 root 帐户。使用 root 账号登录：\n\r\nsu -\r\n\n\r\n然后使用 nano 或 visudo 或任何编辑器打开 /etc/sudoers 文件。\n\r\nnano /etc/sudoers\r\n\n\r\n添加以下行和用户名。根据你的用户名替换 arindam。\n\r\narindam    ALL=(ALL)    ALL\r\n\n\r\n保存并关闭文件。然后，注销并重新登录。这应该会给用户名 root 权限。\n\r\n验证 SUDOERS 组成员\n\r\n要验证用户是否已成功添加到 SUDOERS 组，你可以打开一个新的终端窗口并输入以下命令。将 arindam 替换为你添加到 SUDOERS 组的用户的实际用户名。\n\r\nsudo -l -U arindam\r\n\n\r\n如果用户是 SUDOERS 组的成员，你将看到他们拥有的权限列表。这是一个示例，你可以看到我的用户名具有所有访问权限。\n\r\n\n\r\n结束语\n\r\n将用户添加到 SUDOERS 组将授予他们重要的管理权限。在授予用户此类访问权限之前，仔细考虑用户的可信度和责任非常重要。sudo 使用不当可能会导致系统意外损坏或受损。\n\r\n请记住在委派管理权限时要小心谨慎，并定期检查用户权限以维护安全的 Debian 系统。\n\r\n（题图：MJ/c71c2f28-51c7-44c7-87be-af88088bf459）\n\r\n\r\nvia: https://www.debugpoint.com/add-users-sudoers/\n\r\n作者：Arindam 选题：lkxed 译者：geekpi 校对：校对者ID\n\r\n本文由 LCTT 原创编译，Linux中国 荣誉推出",

          "description": "以下是在 GNOME 版本的 Fedora 工作站中启用分数缩放的步骤。\n\r\n\r\n分数缩放Fractional Scaling 是一项方便的功能，可让你最大程度地优化 HiDPI 显示器和高分辨率笔记本电脑。通过微调缩放比例，你可以创建平衡良好、既不太大也不太小且美观的桌面显示。虽然通过分辨率设置也可以，但由于操作系统的限制，它们通常符合你的实际情况。\n\r\n此外，它还允许你增加显示屏上文本和其他 UI 元素的大小，而不会使所有内容显得模糊。如果你有高分辨率显示器并希望使文本更易于阅读，这将很有用。\n\r\nUbuntu 20.04 LTS 在 2020 年引入了 100%、125%、150%、175% 和 200% 的分数缩放。它可以在“显示Display”页面下的“设置Settings”中找到。\n\r\n但在默认 GNOME 桌面的 Fedora 工作站中，只有 100% 和 200% 缩放可用。\n\r\n\n\r\n如何使用 GNOME 在 Fedora 中启用分数缩放\n\r\n打开终端窗口（CTRL+ALT+T）。\n\r\n运行以下命令。此命令在带有 GNOME 的 Fedora 中启用 125%、150% 和 175% 缩放因子。\n\r\ngsettings set org.gnome.mutter experimental-features \"['scale-monitor-framebuffer']\"\r\n\n\r\n重启 Fedora。\n\r\n打开 “设置” 应用，你应该会看到新的缩放因子。\n\r\n\n\r\n但是，重要的是要注意分数缩放并不总是完美的。某些应用程序可能无法正确缩放。例如，如果应用程序设计不当，非 GTK 应用可能看起来很模糊。\n\r\n此外，请务必注意，由于 GPU 的渲染工作量更大，分数缩放可能会增加笔记本电脑的功耗。\n\r\n一些使用说明\n\r\n根据我的测试，上述命令在 Wayland 中应该是有效的。\n\r\n如果你不想使用上述命令，但仍想获得类似的体验，那么你可以按照以下步骤操作：\n\r\n使用 sudo dnf install gnome-tweaks 安装 GNOME “调整Tweaks” 应用。\n\r\n转到 “字体Fonts” 设置并更改比例因子。\n\r\n示例：如果你想保持 100% 缩放比例但想要更大的字体，请尝试缩放比例设为 1.1 或 1.2。根据你的需要进行调整。\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n125%：这是分数缩放的典型值。它将文本大小和 UI 元素增加 25% 而不会使所有内容显得模糊。\n\r\n150%：对于想要放大文本和其他 UI 元素但又不想增加显示分辨率的人来说，这是一个很好的值。\n\r\n175%：对于想要使文本和其他 UI 元素变得非常大的人来说，这是一个很好的值。\n\r\n\r\n尝试不同的缩放因子对于找到最适合你的缩放因子至关重要。最佳缩放因子将取决于你的显示器尺寸、视力和偏好。\n\r\n我希望本指南有所帮助。\n\r\n（题图：MJ/4346b556-57ed-4c76-b2c9-e651e0d229f5）\n\r\n\r\nvia: https://www.debugpoint.com/fractional-scaling-fedora/\n\r\n作者：Arindam 选题：lkxed 译者：geekpi 校对：校对者ID\n\r\n本文由 LCTT 原创编译，Linux中国 荣誉推出",

          "description": "开发人员可以通过将开源软件集成到其代码库中，节省时间并避免重复发明轮子。然而，这也带来了严重的许可侵权风险。你必须遵守适用于重新使用的开源代码的众多开源许可证之一。如果你不这样做，你（或你所在公司）有可能因违反开源许可证条款而被起诉。即使这种诉讼并不普遍发生，它们确实存在。实际上，考虑到现在许多开源项目由希望保护其在开源社区中的投资的企业运营，这种情况在未来可能更加频繁发生。\n\r\n1、熟悉开源许可证\n\r\n了解开源许可证是防止开源许可侵权问题中最重要的一步。很容易认为所有开源许可证都施加相同的条件，或者它们都基本要求源代码的持续可用性。实际上，有数十种不同的开源许可证，它们都有着非常不同的条款。简单地认为只要你从一个开源项目获取代码，你可以随意使用它并保持源代码可访问，这是一个严重的错误。几个开源许可证的一个典型但经常被忽视的条件可能是需要向原始作者提供致谢。\n\r\n2、记录你使用的开源内容\n\r\n建立一个标准化的方法来记录你使用开源代码的情况是一个优秀的做法。导入模块或从 GitHub 粘贴代码并不难。但如果你不追踪代码来自何处以及使用了何种许可证，你可能会忘记在代码库中如何以及在哪里集成开源内容。此外，如果你在借用代码时无法证明自己遵守了有效的许可条件，那么在开源许可证发生变化时可能会产生问题。考虑在文档维基（如果有的话）中添加一个页面，列出你使用的开源代码，以避免出现这个问题。每当你包含开源组件或依赖时，至少在你自己的源代码中添加注释。\n\r\n3、避免使用未经授权的开源组件\n\r\n有时，你可能会偶然发现一个隐藏的 GitHub 存储库或其他源代码托管位置，其中包含你希望使用的代码，但没有提到任何许可指南。你可能会认为代码的创建者希望让其成为开源代码，并且你可以根据自己的意愿使用它。但这是一个危险的假设。开发人员可能会后续对代码设置特定的许可条件，并要求你遵守这些条件，这可能导致未来产生许可侵权的指控。除非你有非常充分的理由，否则避免使用缺乏明确许可限制的模糊代码。\n\r\n4、创建自己的开源代码\n\r\n将你自己的软件完全开源是减少与开源许可相关风险的一种方法。这意味着你将自动遵守任何要求保留派生源代码的开源许可条件。然而，请记住，仅仅开放你自己的代码并不能确保完全遵守许可证。你仍然需要努力确保你遵守每个许可证的规定，因为适用于你借用的代码的许可证可能与你选择的开源许可证不同。然而，你无需担心与源代码共享相关的任何条款。\n\r\n5、自动检测开源组件\n\r\n虽然在代码库内手动跟踪你如何使用开源是很好的做法，但通过使用能够自动识别开源组件和依赖项的软件，你可以降低出错的可能性。在这里，我们应该考虑两种不同类型的工具。一种是源代码组成分析（SCA）软件，它会自动扫描源代码并识别从值得信任的外部来源获取的元素。另一种是软件供应链管理解决方案，除其他功能外，还支持查找和监控应用程序堆栈中的任何开源依赖项。\n\r\n（题图：MJ/2168d466-cfc3-47de-a8a5-fc7ebaaa445f）\n\r\n\r\nvia: https://www.opensourceforu.com/2022/08/5-ways-to-prevent-open-source-licensing-violations/\n\r\n作者：Laveesh Kocher 选题：lkxed 译者：ChatGPT 校对：wxy\n\r\n本文由 LCTT 原创编译，Linux中国 荣誉推出",

          "description": "人工智能工件需要新的开源许可证\n\r\n上世纪七八十年代，由于自由软件运动的兴起，从版权法中衍生出来了自由及开源软件许可证，护航了自由及开源软件的蓬勃发展。人工智能诞生于开源软件，像 TensorFlow、PyTorch 这样的人工智能程序在其开源许可下运行良好。但新的人工智能工件，如数据集、模型、权重等并不完全适用于传统的版权模式。就像对 GitHub Copilot 输出的代码建议的起诉案，相信对用于训练人工智能违例使用各种训练素材的起诉会越来越多。甚至，会有像专利巨魔一样的许可证巨魔出现。开源倡议（OSI）和许多开源和人工智能领导人正在努力将人工智能和开源许可证以对两者都有意义的方式结合起来。\n\r\n\r\n消息来源：The Register\n\r\n\r\n\r\n老王点评：人工智能崛起的太快，一年前还没什么人谈论人工智能，以至于很多事情都来不及做好准备。所以，现在需要一个像当年的自由软件宣言一样的提纲挈领的倡议出现，以及在这个基础上建立的不同的许可证，才能真正为人工智能的发展铺平道路。\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n安卓的紧急呼叫打爆英国 999 紧急电话\n\r\n安卓 12 系统为紧急服务增加了一个简单的功能：只要连按五次电源键，你的手机就会为你拨打紧急服务。当手机放在你的口袋里，或者你有一个不正常的电源按钮时，这显然很容易意外地做到。英国警方称，“所有紧急服务机构目前都在经历创纪录的 999 电话量”。有趣的是，带有这个功能的安卓 12 是在一年半前推出的，但直到现在才逐步普及到足够多的设备上。从那时起，就有源源不断的帖子提醒人们注意这个问题。在补丁出来之前，谷歌目前的建议是关闭该功能。\n\r\n\r\n消息来源：Ars Technica\n\r\n\r\n\r\n老王点评：这又是一个产品经理想当然的功能。\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n新车质量因使用更多新技术而下降\n\r\n据研究，在美国销售的新车的质量正在下降，因为越来越多地使用了新技术和某些零件的制造质量下降等因素使这些车型更有“问题”。报告说，在过去两年中，每 100 辆车的问题数（PP100）上升了 30。特斯拉的 PP100 质量评级，同比增加了 31，到 2023 年达到了 257。新车提供的电子触摸式设计的门把手也成为了一个问题，在 10 个问题最多的车型中，有 7 个是电池电动车。\n\r\n\r\n消息来源：路透社\n\r\n\r\n\r\n老王点评：电动车是有很多先进的地方，但是堆砌不成熟的新技术往往是造成崩溃的原因。这有点像一个刚刚学会使用新框架的开发者，喜欢利用各种新功能来开发软件，但是往往出现一些问题。",

          "description": "Meta公司的新社交软件Threads已登陆美国苹果应用程序商店，这款社交应用预计将于7月6日正式发布，其与马斯克旗下的推特（Twitter）软件非常相似。\n\r\n\r\n据美国有线电视新闻网（CNN）7月4日报道，Meta公司创始人兼首席执行官扎克伯格，坐拥Facebook和Instagram两款社交软件，其公司预告了一款新的应用程序Threads，该软件将通过提供一个可在线实时对话的平台来与推特竞争。根据苹果应用程序商店的列表，它预计将于7月6日正式上线。根据苹果商店的描述，该应用似乎与推特有许多相似之处。\n\r\n\r\n“Threads是一个可以与他人一起讨论从你今天关心的主题到明天的趋势以及所有其他事情的社区。”上述描述写道，“无论你对什么感兴趣，你都可以关注并直接与你最喜欢的创作者和其他喜欢同样事物的人联系——或者建立自己的忠实追随者群体，与世界分享你的想法、观点和创造力。”\n\r\n\r\nMeta公司在近日发布Threads这一新软件的决定，可能受推特在7月初出现故障的影响，推特在故障结束后宣布对其用户能够阅读的推文数量进行了临时限制。马斯克说，这些限制是为了 \"解决极端程度的数据搜刮和系统操纵\"。\n\r\n\r\n马斯克7月3日在推特上评论了Threads，他说： \"谢天谢地，他们的运作是如此理智。“自2022年10月入主推特以来，马斯克对推特的运作方式进行了巨大的改动，他现在正在寻找让该平台恢复增长的方法。推特于7月3日宣布，用户很快需要为TweetDeck付费，这是一个可以让人们管理关注的账户的工具。\n\r\n\r\n另一边，推特也在试图蚕食Meta的领域。今年5月，推特增加了加密信息功能，并表示后续将推出通话功能，这些发展可能使该平台与同样属于Meta的Facebook Messenger和WhatsApp竞争。\n\r\n\r\n来源：澎湃新闻",

          "description": "近日，全国多家高校发布公告称，7月1日起开始暂停使用微信支付，原因是微信支付将收取0.6%的手续费，而此前，微信支付对教育场景下的支付服务一直免收服务费。\n\r\n\r\n据不完全统计，目前已有西北大学、南京理工大学、江苏师范大学等多所高校均发布了类似的停用微信支付公告。\n\r\n\r\n6月27日，西北大学发布的公告称，“因腾讯公司微信支付将于 7 月 1 日起对校园场景用户进行精细化管理，除收学费外，其它收费均会受到限制并收取 0.6% 的手续费，决定对校内一卡通用户暂停提供微信扫码支付服务。”\n\r\n\r\n周口师范学院也表示，接到财付通支付科技有限公司通知后，学校多方沟通并未收到明显效果，为减轻不必要的财政负担，决定自6月29日起停用校内微信支付场景应用，包括财务处收取的各类费用、校园一卡通充值、教材费缴纳、教职员工生活区网络交通费、学生宿舍空调电费、商业用房电费缴费等。\n\r\n\r\n针对此事，微信团队表示，由于我们对高校生活服务场景支付费率问题处理不周，造成大家的困扰，在此向广大学校及师生致歉。请大家放心，在校园非盈利场景，我们会持续保持零费率优惠政策。\n\r\n\r\n此次调整的本意是为了对费率实施更加精细化的优惠措施，但很显然过于简单粗暴引起误解，我们深表歉意，即刻修正，后续我们将继续优化与高校的沟通流程，加强合作，助力校园数字化的持续发展。\n\r\n\r\n此外，据记者了解，针对教育场景，云闪付、支付宝、银行等渠道等尚未出现支付费用上涨的问题，仍可正常使用。\n\r\n\r\n博通咨询金融分析师王蓬博对记者表示，校园场景总体来看一直是被当做公益类场景，监管也一直延续对这类场景的支付费率优惠政策，并且从2021年开始也一直号召对中小微企业和公益类场景减费让利。\n\r\n\r\n他表示，由于商业发展和政策等多方面原因，账户侧数字钱包分润模式种类多样，此前对于一般类场景才能够达到0.6%的手续费费率，对于公益类场景一直是0费率，此次微信支付对校园场景提价，说明微信本身依靠金融科技版块盈利的压力较大。因此，建议微信支付自身做好社会责任和盈利之间的平衡，目前微信可以依靠高粘性获取用户，但年轻用户群体的使用习惯也有可能改变。\n\r\n\r\n记者注意到，中国银行卡收单市场的费率一直处于较低水平，导致收单机构的利润率较低，受到近年来严监管的持续，支付收单机构的合规成本也在逐渐增加，也让银行卡收单机构们在“跳码”事件后，开始提高特定场景的收单费率。\n\r\n\r\n此外，腾讯最新发布的财报显示，腾讯金融科技板块增长较为乏力，2022年，腾讯金融科技及企业服务业务年度的收入同比仅增长3%，至1771亿元。\n\r\n\r\n稿源：界面新闻",

          "description": "6月28日，菜鸟集团宣布推出自营的品质快递业务：菜鸟速递。菜鸟速递历经六年打造，由服务天猫超市的配送业务升级为全国快递网络，主打半日达、当次日达、送货上门和夜间揽收等品质服务，在全国近三百城提供晚到、破损必赔，不上门必赔，在途拦截和在途更改目的地等五个100%承诺。\n\r\n\r\n据了解，菜鸟速递是适应市场上对高质量快递需要而生，主要聚焦“菜鸟自营、品质快递、好用不贵”，服务上对标行业最优，价格上兼具性价比，并按照时效和重量提供丰富的产品矩阵，覆盖大件、中小件和微小件等全重量级包裹。\n\r\n\r\n“中国快递市场发展得足够快、也足够大，需要物流行业提供多层次的供给，菜鸟希望打造更具性价比的品质服务，满足商家不断出现的新需求。”菜鸟集团CEO万霖表示。\n\r\n\r\n六年前，由于市场上高质量快递供给不足，尤其是高性价比品质快递服务的稀缺，菜鸟速递开始着手搭建落地配网络，支撑天猫超市等阿里内部自营业务的发展，逐步将消费者体验提升到行业领先水平。\n\r\n\r\n六年来，市场对品质快速服务的需求不断攀升，但供给持续紧缺。菜鸟的这张落地配网络也引发市场关注，不断有商家提出希望菜鸟开放自营物流能力。随着菜鸟搭建全国性的干线运输、转运网络，全面将落地配网络升级为具有跨区域配送、揽派一体的全国性快递网络，菜鸟速递正式推出。\n\r\n\r\n6月28日，在全球智慧物流峰会现场，认养一头牛、青岛啤酒、添可、欧珀莱、盒马和银泰百货等客户与菜鸟速递签约，意味着菜鸟速递已全面向市场开放。同时菜鸟速递也接入菜鸟供应链，与菜鸟仓组成了优选仓配半日达服务，为商家提供仓配一体化的品质服务，提升消费者体验。\n\r\n\r\n据介绍，乳业龙头伊利在天猫上的部分旗舰店去年开始试用菜鸟速递服务，物流问题投诉下降30%，大促物流成本下降30%，退货率也少了一倍，且老客户复购占比提升了10%。\n\r\n\r\n快递行业专家赵小敏认为，菜鸟速递的推出，实质上是响应市场的需求，“菜鸟速递对快递市场来说是一种有益补充，消费市场容量足够大，还有广阔的发展空间，并不会与通达系等经济型快递形成直接竞争关系。”\n\r\n\r\n菜鸟速递是今年菜鸟重点建设的国内物流业务产品。菜鸟还在加快国际快递和海外本地快递的建设。据悉，未来十年，菜鸟将着力建设一张全球领先的智慧物流网络，打造国内、跨境和海外本地等三大长链物流网络，同时形成末端驿站、物流地产和物流科技等三大短链业务。\n\r\n\r\n稿源：新民晚报",

Cyber security, the societal impact of AI, data and privacy are important issues for legislators globally. At the same time, the COVID-19 pandemic drove collaborative development to unprecedented levels and took Open Source software, open research, open content and data from mainstream to main stage. Moving forward, developing these important public policies whilst not harming the ecosystem requires an understanding of how the Open Source ecosystem works. Ensuring stakeholders without historic benefit of representation are included in those discussions becomes paramount to that end.\n\nThe OPA will focus on educating public policy makers on Open Source to inform their development and deliberation of new policy concepts. There are unintended consequences that come from a lack of understanding of how open collaboration works in practice. The OPA will address this as well as the historic absence of contribution from underrepresented groups. The interest areas of the OPA community will complement those of Digitable Public Goods Alliance, a UNICEF multi-stakeholder initiative with a mission to accelerate the attainment of sustainable development goals in low- and middle-income countries that OSI joined earlier this year.",

The maple tree,\n\tresponsible for managing virtual memory areas, can undergo node\n\treplacement without properly acquiring the MM write lock, leading\n\tto use-after-free issues. An unprivileged local user could use this\n\tflaw to compromise the kernel and escalate their privileges.\n\n\tAs StackRot is a Linux kernel vulnerability found in the memory\n\tmanagement subsystem, it affects almost all kernel configurations\n\tand requires minimal capabilities to trigger. However, it should be\n\tnoted that maple nodes are freed using RCU callbacks, delaying the\n\tactual memory deallocation until after the RCU grace\n\tperiod. Consequently, exploiting this vulnerability is considered\n\tchallenging.\n\n\nThe disclosure contains a detailed description of the problem.  Fixes have\nbeen merged into the\nmainline and the 6.4.1, 6.3.11, and 6.1.37\nstable kernel updates.",

          "description": "Over on the Software Freedom Conservancy blog, Policy Fellow and Hacker-in-Residence Bradley M. Kuhn analyzes the recent changes to Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) source availability in light of the GPL.  It contains some interesting information about two alleged GPL violations that came about because the company's business model is structured in a way that brings it too close to non-compliance with the license, he said:\n\nPerhaps the biggest problem with a murky business model that skirts the line of GPL compliance is that violations can and do happen — since even a minor deviation from the business model clearly violates the GPL agreements. Pre-IBM Red Hat deserves a certain amount of credit, as SFC is aware of only two documented incidents of GPL violations that have occurred since 2006 regarding the RHEL business model. We've decided to share some general details of these violations for the purpose of explaining where this business model can so easily cross the line.\n\n[...] In another violation incident, we learned that Red Hat, in a specific non-USA country, was requiring that any customer who lowered the number of RHEL machines under service contract with Red Hat sign an additional agreement. This additional agreement promised that the customer had deleted every copy of RHEL in their entire organization other than the copies of RHEL that were currently contracted for service with Red Hat. Again, this is a \"further restriction\". The GPL agreements give everyone the unfettered right to make and keep as many copies of the software as they like, and a distributor of GPL'd software may not require a user to attest that they've deleted these legitimate, licensed copies of third-party-licensed software under the GPL. SFC informed Red Hat's legal department of this violation, and we were assured that this additional agreement would no longer be presented to any Red Hat customers in the future.",
