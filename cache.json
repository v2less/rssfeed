          "description": "I’m looking for a job and like many people in this situation am finding it unusually difficult.\nI’ve read rumors that many firms are actually in a hiring freeze, but they keep job reqs open for appearances. Apparently some investors use job postings as a company health metric.\nFrom my contacts, I am personally aware of situations where internally-recommended CVs are ignored by HR, and other cases had open job postings and passed people successfully through the interview process, and then the hiring manager still didn’t pull the trigger. I have no way of knowing how widespread this is, but it is happening at some places.\nIs your company like this? If you have real info and not just suspicions, let’s name some names.\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41714672\nPoints: 34\n# Comments: 0",

You have to comb through your whole app and look for what needs to be translated and manually update your translations every time new stuff gets added. People sometimes hire their own in-house translators, or they send off their translations to humans to be translated, which takes days, weeks, or worse and costs a ton. Internationalization is, of course, super important for user growth and retention, and often neglected until very late, when competitors will make your product for LATAM, APAC, or Europe.\nI worked at Slack for…",

          "description": "Hi,\nI created httpdbg, a tool for Python developers to easily debug HTTP(S) client requests in Python programs.\nI developed it because I needed a tool that could help me trace the HTTP requests sent by my tests back to the corresponding methods in our API client.\nThe goal of this tool is to simplify the debugging process, so I designed it to be as simple as possible. It requires no external dependencies, no setup, no superuser privileges, and no code modifications.\nI'm sharing it with you today because I use it regularly, and it seems like others have found it useful too—so it might be helpful for you as well.\nHope you will like it.\ncle\nSource: https://github.com/cle-b/httpdbg\nDocumentation: https://httpdbg.readthedocs.io/\nA blog post on a use case: https://medium.com/@cle-b/trace-all-your-http-requests-in-py...\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41650905\nPoints: 73\n# Comments: 30",

          "description": "Hey HN! We're Raymond Xu and Raffi Isanians, the team behind Modern Realty (https://modernrealty.io). Modern Realty is an AI-powered real estate buying experience that helps you purchase homes without relying on a traditional realtor. Demo: https://youtu.be/VhsWSVn5blA\nOur mission at Modern Realty is to make home buying easier, faster, and far more enjoyable. We interpret real estate data, giving you an edge on other home buyers.\nSince 2024, there has been a growing need for innovative solutions in real estate, especially with tools like Zillow making it easier than ever for buyers to find the right house at the right price. However, the process still requires an agent, even though buyers are doing most of the work themselves. Modern Realty changes this by offering an AI self-service solution.\nRaymond and Raffi came face-to-face with this technology's potential while working on AI at Google and handling billion-dollar asset transactions as an attorney, respectively. The AI tools we've built guide users through every step of the home-buying process, from scheduling showings to making offers, all without the need for a traditional agent.\nBefore we expand further, this summer we've built our core AI real estate agent, which can handle everything from disclosure summaries to competitive market analyses. You can see our platform in action at https://modernrealty.io. We're particularly proud of our offer generation tool, which creates offers that are then reviewed by an attorney at no additional cost.\nWe're excited to be launching here on HN and would love to hear what you think! If you're in the market for a new home or just curious about the future of real estate, visit our website or schedule a call with us to get started.\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41638199\nPoints: 90\n# Comments: 187",

          "description": "Hey HN! We’re Emma and Chris, founders of Velvet (https://www.usevelvet.com).\nVelvet proxies OpenAI calls and stores the requests and responses in your PostgreSQL database. That way, you can analyze logs with SQL (instead of a clunky UI). You can also set headers to add caching and metadata (for analysis).\nBackstory: We started by building some more general AI data tools (like a text-to-SQL editor). We were frustrated by the lack of basic LLM infrastructure, so ended up pivoting to focus on the tooling we wanted. So many existing apps, like Helicone, were hard to use as power users. We just wanted a database.\nScale: We’ve already warehoused 50m requests for customers, and have optimized the platform for scale and latency. We’ve built the proxy on Cloudflare Workers, and latency is nominal. We’ve built some “yak shaving” features that were really complex such as decomposing OpenAI Batch API requests so you can track each log individually. One of our early customers (https://usefind.ai/) makes millions of OpenAI requests per day, up to 1500 requests per second.\nVision: We’re trying to build development tools that have as little UI as possible, that can be controlled entirely with headers and code. We also want to blend cloud and on-prem for the best of both worlds — allowing for both automatic updates and complete data ownership.\nHere are some things you can do with Velvet logs:\n- Observe requests, responses, and latency\n- Analyze costs by metadata, such as user ID\n- Track batch progress and speed\n- Evaluate model changes\n- Export datasets for fine-tuning of gpt-4o-mini\n(this video shows how to do each of those: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KaFkRi5ESi8)\n--\nTo see how it works, try chatting with our demo app that you can use without logging in: https://www.usevelvet.com/sandbox\nSetting up your own proxy is 2 lines of code and takes ~5 mins.\nTry it out and let us know what you think!\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41637550\nPoints: 8\n# Comments: 2",

          "description": "Hi HN!\nI made a live presidential polling website with real-time electoral results. Votes can be changed at any time until the poll closes. Only visitors from the USA can participate. Congressional district is detected automatically.\nThe idea is to enable a coordinated voting process, where selections are non-binding and negotiable rather than blindly cast once. Kind of like a presidential caucus, but national and over the Internet.\nThe infra is Fastly & DigitalOcean. Backend is a Django service running on DO App Platform with Postgres. Fastly is used for edge logic, captcha, geo location, and pushing updates to the page (Fanout). In theory it should be able to handle millions of participants.\nNote: since my previous post, I've added a way to close the poll after a time period. I realized that without some kind of time boxing it was unclear what the point is or how long to participate.\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41630976\nPoints: 4\n# Comments: 1",

          "description": "Hey HN, we recently fine-tuned the llama3.1 405B model on 8xAMD MI300x GPUs using JAX instead of PyTorch. JAX's advanced sharding APIs allowed us to achieve great performance. Check out our blog post to learn about the cool sharding tricks we used. We've also open-sourced the code: https://github.com/felafax/felafax\nWe're a small startup building AI infra for fine-tuning and serving LLMs on non-NVIDIA hardware (TPUs, AMD, Trainium).\nProblem: Many companies are trying to get PyTorch working on AMD GPUs, but we believe this is a treacherous path. PyTorch is deeply intertwined with the NVIDIA ecosystem in a lot of ways (e.g., `torch.cuda` or scaled_dot_product_attention is an NVIDIA CUDA kernel exposed as a PyTorch function). So, to get PyTorch code running on non-NVIDIA hardware, there's a lot of \"de-NVIDIAfying\" that needs to be done.\nSolution: We believe JAX is a better fit for non-NVIDIA hardware. In JAX, ML model code compiles to hardware-independent HLO graphs, which are then optimized by the XLA compiler before hardware-specific optimization. This clean separation allowed us to run the same LLaMA3 JAX code both on Google TPUs and AMD GPUs with no changes.\nOur strategy as a company is to invest upfront in porting models to JAX, then leverage its framework and XLA kernels to extract maximum performance from non-NVIDIA backends. This is why we first ported Llama 3.1 from PyTorch to JAX, and now the same JAX model works great on TPUs and runs perfectly on AMD GPUs.\nWe'd love to hear your thoughts on our vision and repo!\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41630913\nPoints: 12\n# Comments: 0",

It's about how to organize programs around data \"as plain data\" and the surprisingly benefits that emerge when we do. Programs that are built around the data they manage tend to be simpler, smaller, and significantly easier understand.\nJava has changed radically over the last several years. It has picked up all kinds of new language features which support data oriented programming (records, pattern matching, `with` expressions, sum and product types). However, this is not a book about tools. No amount of studying a screw-driver will teach you how to build a house. This book focuses on house building. We'll pick out a plot of land, lay a foundation, and build upon it house that can weather any storm.\nDoP is based around a very simple idea, and one people have been rediscovering since the dawn of computing, \"representation is the essence of programming.\" When we do a really good job of capturing the data in our domain, the rest of the system tends to fall into place in a way which can feel like it’s writing itself.\nThat's my elevator pitch! The book is currently in early access. I hope you check it out. I'd love to hear your feedback.\nYou can get 50% off (thru October 9th) with code `mlkiehl`\nhttps://www.manning.com/books/data-oriented-programming-in-j...\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41629377\nPoints: 217\n# Comments: 64",

Working with startups, doing interviews and sifting through endless software reviews are daunting tasks. So, we built a chatbot that lets you chat with over 3 million reviews from more than 100K SaaS products.\nWith Reviewradar, you can ask questions like:\n- create a comprehensive SWOT analysis for both Notion and Obsidian\n- give me negative feedback and complaints you have about Postmark\n- summarise the reviews you have on products in the OCR category\nI would love to get your feedback on it. Check it out here: https://reviewradar.ai\nLooking forward to your thoughts / suggestions,\nAndrei and Roman\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41616763\nPoints: 76\n# Comments: 35",

          "description": "Hi HN!  I’m Tony, one of the co-founders of Inngest (https://inngest.com/)\nInngest is an open-source durable workflow platform that works on any cloud.  Durable workflows are stateful, long running step functions written in code, which automatically retry on failure.  It abstracts everything about queues, event streams and state for you, letting you focus on code.  Some examples of uses:  managing stateful AI chained step functions;  managing search/rag indexes and data pipelines;  integrations and webhooks;  billing and payment flows.\nTechnical details:  unlike other solutions, we put lots of effort into designing our SDK’s step.run APIs to make them extremely easy to use — developer experience is the most important thing for us.\nWe had to design and build our own queueing system to work with multi-tenancy, batching, and debouncing, and we’re iterating on this as we move to FoundationDB.  It’s largely all Go in the backend, with a bunch of caching, clickhouse, event streams, and coordination on our behalf.  Workers are shared nothing, and run based off of the queue and execution state.\nWe did a post last year as we iterated on our TS SDK.  The product has changed a lot since then and wanted to show the community what’s changed as we reach 1.0:\n    * Golang, Java, and Python SDKs with cross-language function invocation (across clouds, too)\n\n    * Multi-tenant aware flow control (concurrency, throttling, debounce)\n\n    * Batching, grouping many events into a single function call\n\n    * Much improved dashboard, with tracing and metrics built in\n\n    * Advanced recovery tools like function replay, temporary pausing,  bulk cancellation (with optional expressions).  No more dead letter queues!\n\n    * Branch deploys built in, with staging env support out of the box\n\n    * Full local testing with production parity\n\n\nWanted to say thank you to the HN community for feedback so far!  Happy Friday :)\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41604042\nPoints: 83\n# Comments: 26",

          "description": "We just released a very excited touch sensor that finally simplifies touch sensing for robotics.\nOur most exciting result: Learned visuotactile policies for precise tasks like inserting USBs and credit card swiping, that work out-of-the-box when you replace skins! To the best of our knowledge, this has never been shown before with any existing tactile sensor.\nWhy is this important? For the first time, you could now collect data and train models on one sensor and expect them to generalize to new copies of the sensor -- opening the door to the kind of large foundation models that have revolutionized vision and language reasoning.\nWould love to hear the community's questions, thoughts and comments!\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41603865\nPoints: 166\n# Comments: 26",

          "description": "Numscript is a simple, declarative language that helps you model financial transactions. You can do quite a few things with it, such as modeling:\n* Payments involving vouchers and a user's prepaid balance\n* Complex funds destination scenario where the customer gets cash back\n* Configurable user credit balance spending transactions\nThe main idea is to take the pain out of describing of a system dealing with money movements should behave in traditional languages such as JS/TS/Go/Ruby etc, landing an expressive way to model these movements of value.\nIt is voluntarily broad in applicability—our customers use it today for use-cases ranging from marketplaces funds orchestration to home-grown loan management systems.\nOnce those transactions are modeled, they are to be picked up and committed to a system-of-record, ledgering system or executed on a set of payments and banking APIs.\nIt was initially a DSL we bundled into our Core Ledger product at Formance (YCS21) but we're giving it more autonomy now and started to make it standalone, with the idea that anyone could eventually bolt Numscript on top of their ledgering system. We're also exploring to make it natively compatible with other backends.\nAs part of this un-bundling, we've just shipping a playground which lets you fiddle with it without installing anything at https://playground.numscript.org/ (it works best on desktop).\nHappy to chime in on any questions!\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41593216\nPoints: 103\n# Comments: 21",

          "description": "Hi HN,\nWe are Cyril & Ulric and are building Marblism (https://marblism.com), an LLM-based dev platform to generate and iterate on full-stack web apps.\nHere’s a demo video that goes from a comment on Twitter to a working app in 10 minutes: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TapOPO-Gv20.\nMarblism started when we realized that much of the code we write for web apps is just slightly modified boilerplate: similar login flows, dashboards, API integrations, CRUD operations, etc. While AI tools are helpful, they fall short in delivering a well-architected codebase. The idea of Marblism is to combine the best of both worlds: a solid boilerplate, customized and enhanced with AI.\nHere's how it works:\nGenerate your app -  Describe your product, and the AI will build your data model. We create a NextJS app with auth, custom CRUDs, permissions, payment, emails. The AI then generates your front-end pages.\nTest and improve your app - Now that your app is set up, use our online workspace to test your app and add more complex features via an AI Chat or directly yourself in the VSCode editor.\nGo live - Once you’re happy with your app, deploy it in production in one click.\nHere are some examples of apps generated on Marblism in couple of hours of prompting:\nFind and validate startup ideas: https://www.muckbrass.com/\nA design system directory: https://awesomedesignsystem.app.io\nAI-Personalized candle: https://www.scent-a-scene.com/\nMarblism currently generates web apps like SaaS, marketplaces, and social networks. It doesn't support Chrome extensions or mobile apps, and it’s not really for small games like Snake/Tetris.\nThe vision is to add more tech stacks later this year and enable people to create their own templates/tech stack that the AI can customize.\nWe’re really excited to share this with you and we'd love to hear your thoughts on the potential directions we can take this product.\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41568343\nPoints: 81\n# Comments: 58",

          "description": "Hey HN! I'm Caleb, one of the contributors to Opik, a new open source framework for LLM evaluations.\nOver the last few months, my colleagues and I have been working on a project to solve what we see as the most painful parts of writing evals for an LLM application. For this initial release, we've focused on a few core features that we think are the most essential:\n- Simplifying the implementation of more complex LLM-based evaluation metrics, like Hallucination and Moderation.\n- Enabling step-by-step tracking, such that you can test and debug each individual component of your LLM application, even in more complex multi-agent architectures.\n- Exposing an API for \"model unit tests\" (built on Pytest), to allow you to run evals as part of your CI/CD pipelines\n- Providing an easy UI for scoring, annotating, and versioning your logged LLM data, for further evaluation or training.\nIt's often hard to feel like you can trust an LLM application in production, not just because of the stochastic nature of the model, but because of the opaqueness of the application itself. Our belief is that with better tooling for evaluations, we can meaningfully improve this situation, and unlock a new wave of LLM applications.\nYou can run Opik locally, or with a free API key via our cloud platform. You can use it with any model server or hosted model, but we currently have a built-in integration with the OpenAI Python library, which means it automatically works not just with OpenAI models, but with any model served via a compatible model server (ollama, vLLM, etc). Opik also currently has out-of-the-box integrations with LangChain, LlamaIndex, Ragas, and a few other popular tools.\nThis is our initial release of Opik, so if you have any feedback or questions, I'd love to hear them!\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41567192\nPoints: 57\n# Comments: 9",

I'm especially curious about more recent examples of specific devices that run L4 variants (seL4, PikeOS, OKL4, etc.).  I already found a few that use seL4, but to take OKL4 as an example, most of the specific devices I could find are from more than a decade ago, and I'm trying to find things from at least the last 5 or 6 years.  I'm even more curious to find devices that use a form of L4 as a hypervisor.\nHas anyone here worked on a device that used an L4-related kernel or hypervisor?  I know one major area they're used in is defense and full of NDAs, but hopefully some of the other industries they're used in (medical devices, automotive, IoT) are a little less restrictive.

Some of our recent hurricane forecasts can be visualized at https://hurricanes2024.silurian.ai/.\nWhat is it worth to know the weather forecast 1 day earlier? That’s not a hypothetical question, traditional forecasting systems have been improving their skill at a rate of 1 day per decade. In other words, today’s 6-day forecast is as accurate as the 5-day forecast ten years ago. No one expects this rate of improvement to hold steady, it has to slow down eventually, right? Well in the last couple years GPUs and modern deep learning have actually sped it up.\nSince 2022 there has been a flurry of weather deep learning system…",

          "description": "Hi all,\nI've made a javascript library to simplify searching/sorting/filtering in arrays of objects. Its inspired by both GraphQL and SQL, but implemented using javascript Proxies. Instead of creating a new language, its all just javascript.\nI've made it as part of an experimental database, which uses javascript as the query engine. The normal javascript map/reduce/sort functions are quite difficult to master for junior developers. JAQT is easier to explain, and can still be used in combination with any existing array functions.\nPlease let me know what you think of the API and its ease of use!\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41554177\nPoints: 80\n# Comments: 24",

          "description": "After working with LLMs for long enough, I found myself wanting a lightweight utility for doing various small tasks to prepare inputs, locate information and create evaluators. This library is two things: a very simple model and utilities that inference it (eg. fuzzy deduplication). The target platform is CPU, and it’s intended to be light, fast and pip installable — a library that lowers the barrier to working with strings semantically. You don’t need to install pytorch to use it, or any deep learning runtimes.\nHow can this be accomplished? The model is simply token embeddings that are average pooled. To create this model, I extracted token embedding (nn.Embedding) vectors from LLMs, concatenated them along the embedding dimension, added a learnable weight parameter, and projected them to…",

Super repairable, of course.

Whenever possible, I’ve been trying to use Claude as a first pass when implementing new features / changes. But I found that depending on the type of change I was making, I was spending a lot of thought finding and deciding which source files should be included in the prompt. The need to copy/paste each file individually also becomes a mild annoyance.\nFirst, I implemented `repogather --all` , which unintelligently copies all sources files in your repository to the clipboard (delimited by their relative filepaths). To my surprise, for less complex repositories, this alone is often completely workable for Claude — much better than pasting in the just the few files you …",

          "description": "Hey HN, we wanted to share our repo where we fine-tuned Llama 3.1 on Google TPUs. We’re building AI infra to fine-tune and serve LLMs on non-NVIDIA GPUs (TPUs, Trainium, AMD GPUs).\nThe problem: Right now, 90% of LLM workloads run on NVIDIA GPUs, but there are equally powerful and more cost-effective alternatives out there. For example, training and serving Llama 3.1 on Google TPUs is about 30% cheaper than NVIDIA GPUs.\nBut developer tooling for non-NVIDIA chipsets is lacking. We felt this pain ourselves. We initially tried using PyTorch XLA to train Llama 3.1 on TPUs, but it was rough: xla integration with pytorch is clunky, missing libraries (bitsandbytes didn't work), and cryptic HuggingFace errors.\nWe then took a different route and translated Llama 3.1 from PyTorch to JAX. Now, it’s running smoothly on TPUs! We still have challenges ahead, there is no good LoRA library in JAX, but this feels like the right path forward.\nHere's a demo (https://dub.sh/felafax-demo) of our managed solution.\nWould love your thoughts on our repo and vision as we keep chugging along!\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41512142\nPoints: 68\n# Comments: 19",

          "description": "Hey Hacker News! We’re Abhi and Alex from deepsilicon (https://deepsilicon.com). We are building software and hardware for training and inferencing ternary transformer models. Here's a video of the software: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqBn-I5D6pk.\nTransformer-based models are getting bigger every generation, making the inference hardware requirements more and more expensive. Running large transformer models on device is even more challenging. Usually, they require trillions of FLOPs to run at decent speeds and use too much energy and space.\nOur solution is to train ternary transformer models. There are two advantages to using ternary values. The first is that the weights can now be stored in two bits (or even less) from 16 bits. This represents an almost 8x compression ratio for every…",

          "description": "Hey HN, this is Lina, Andrew, and Sidney from Infinity AI (https://infinity.ai/). We've trained our own foundation video model focused on people. As far as we know, this is the first time someone has trained a video diffusion transformer that’s driven by audio input. This is cool because it allows for expressive, realistic-looking characters that actually speak. Here’s a blog with a bunch of examples: https://toinfinityai.github.io/v2-launch-page/\nIf you want to try it out, you can either (1) go to https://studio.infinity.ai/try-inf2, or (2) post a comment in this thread describing a character and we’ll generate a video for you and reply with a link. For example: \n“Mona Lisa saying ‘what the heck are you smiling at?’”: https://bit.ly/3z8l1TM \n“A 3D pixar-style gnome with a pointy red hat r…",

          "description": "Hey all,\nI'm the founder of Flipt, an open-source  (https://github.com/flipt-io/flipt) feature flag tool that I (and others) have been working on for the past few years.\nAbout a year or two ago we added support for serving flag state from various non-relational declarative stores like Git, OCI, Object Store, etc.\nMany of our users came to love the git-backed storage, as it allows them to keep their feature flags close to their code in there organization's repos. But they had one (rather large) ask, and that was the ability to use the UI to manage flag state changes and still use Git as the backend.\nSo today we're rolling out our hosted solution that does exactly that (and more soon).\nI would love any feedback, questions, etc, or if anyone would give it a spin! Happy to extend the 14-day trial as well for anyone interested in providing product feedback.\nThanks!!\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41460061\nPoints: 10\n# Comments: 0",

          "description": "Hello, everyone!\nMy name is Alex, and I'm an expat in a new country. Two years ago, I moved to Germany where I didn’t know anyone. Starting the job, I realized that becoming close friends with colleagues can be quite challenging and slow. The feeling of loneliness was gradually growing.\nTo change that, I started attending various meetups based on my interests, hoping to make new friends. However, I often found myself answering the same generic questions that didn’t really help me understand if someone shared my values and interests. As a result, lost energy and 0 friends.\nSO - That’s when I began using icebreaking questions in smaller groups. Surprisingly, these questions quickly changed any conversation to a deeper, more engaging and meaningful level. I was able to identify people I genuinely connected with and started spending more time with them.\nBUT - preparing and using these questions was a pain. I would Google the top-100, pick a random number, and choose a question. I felt a strong need for a simple „one button“ that does everything for me.\nAND - After searching and not finding such a solution, I decided to build it myself. I created a vast database of questions across various topics and integrated AI to generate questions on any subject.\nThe idea has resonated well within my communities (university and expat parties), and more people are starting to use it. I’d love to hear your stories with icebreaking questions, your experience, and your feedback so I can make the service even more useful for more people!\nCheck it out and share your thoughts!\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41438542\nPoints: 17\n# Comments: 6",

Here’s a quick demo: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9n_eY-fM_E.\nWhy we’re doing this: Mechanical engineers excel at generating initial design concepts but get bogged down translating ideas into final designs due to tedious, repetitive tasks. Our goal is to automate these mundane processes, allowing engineers to focus on the creative aspects of design.\nHaving worked at multiple hardware companies—from medical devices to space launch vehicles—we know how often “trivial” components such as manufacturing rigging, get brushed under the table in scheduling conversations.  These tasks aren’t necessari…",

The settings closely follow html/css. We think an open canvas is a big improvement over other website builders. Everything is easier: styling, consistency, responsiveness…\nBut making it work was hard! We thought HN would appreciate the tech behind it:\n- A custom WebGL rendering engine (w/text, shadows, blurs, gradients, & opacity groups)\n- A partial implementation of the css spec\n- A custom text editor & text shaper\n- A transformer to turn designs into publishable html/css\nRepaint is a design tool for html/css.

This is an open source plasmid and vector (Short, often circular segments of DNA) editor, with features related to primer quality checks, PCR cloning, and protein analysis. I plan to add more restriction-enzyme-based features in the near future. It has some extras like a solution-mixing helper, automatic feature annotation.\nFrom a technical standpoint, this is a standalone binary written using the EGUI library in rust. A project goal is performance, with small memory footprint, and small application and file sizes.\nThis is a continuous work-in-progress, and I'm open to any and all feedback, criticism, and requested features.\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41435409\nPoints: 81\n# Comments: 20",

Basically, it wants to solve the problems encountered with current solutions:\n- slow typing\n- not easily configurable\n- keyboard layout dependent\n- constant bugs\nAdditionally, Afrim offers the following features [1]:\n- Dataset easily customizable\n- Keyboard layout independent\n- Auto completion, autocorrection and autosuggestion\n- Support all sequential codes\nTechnical details [2]:\nAfrim is written in Rust and his architecture is inspired of RIME.\nWhat's next?\n- Offer an android frontend of the Afrim (in development) [3]\n- Support more African input methods as possible\nI would like to have your opinions about this project. I have been working on it so far, and I would like to know how I can improve it.\n--------------\n[1] https://github.com/pythonbrad/afrim?tab=readme-ov-file#featu...\n[2] https://pythonbrad.github.io/afrim-man/for_developers\n[3] https://github.com/pythonbrad/afrim-keyboard/\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41427563\nPoints: 80\n# Comments: 33",

And its colorful icons inform you of its major modes and states.\n As a bonus, it works for KDE+X11, too. I first developed pwr-tray back when (for me at least) KDE's power management was perpetually broken. This version is a qt5 app which may require some to install the qt5 foundation as a prerequisite.\n A unified power management app is quite the pain on Linux ... hence, pwr-tray on runs only on the few DEs/WMs I care to use.

I was interested since before then, and CrowdStrike pretty much is the nail that close any desire of mine to reinstall Windows again. So I took my blank DVD, burn the Pop!_OS ISO and I install Linux into my ASUS X44H. In short, Pop 22.04 was great, definitely a great time for me. But then I have a GRUB error, and so I install my next distro: Arch\n So I follow this guide and I install Arch on my laptop. I love the fact that it's bleeding edge and AUR is definitely something that I wish all distro have. My only real issue was the GRUB error, which I managed to fix by... reinstall GRUB (Thanks, r/archlinux) and Wine. Unfortunately, Wine prefix creation doesn't seem to work on BTRFS and later when I use Arch again, I use ext4, and while that fix things, Wine still have problem that I am not willing to try and troubleshoot. Also, I use Wine to play Touhou, I can't exactly use any PC without playing Touhou anymore\n Finally, I use Mint, which works perfectly for me in everything that I use (minus AUR and Hyprland). It's just works out of the box. Ok, not really, I still have to setup zram and turn off several things, but afterward, it's all good. It's what I use now on my laptop\n Maybe when I get a new PC, I might multiboot Windows 11 LTSC (for Koikatu and every other game that I can't get to work on Linux. No game that use kernel level anti-cheat though), Mint, Arch and maybe Pop 24.04, whenever it's out\n    submitted by    /u/Okabe_Zero-Link  \n [link]   [comments]",

Its not fancy, its not complex - it just records your keystrokes and repeats them as often as you want. Thats it. Nothing else. \n I also added adjustable timing sliders, one for regular keystrokes and one for alt-tabbing from the macro recorder itself, so it catches special keystrokes and still allows to quickly execute regular typing. Works perfectly for me to quickly go through some Excel spreadsheets, or when logging my working hours in that stupid time tracking system we have.\n I didn't test it thoroughly and I'm sure theres a hundred ways to break it, and I'm sure theres some other useful features which could be added - PRs welcome!\n https://github.com/werzum/MacroRecorder/tree/main\n    submitted by    /u/werzum  \n [link]   [comments]",

It really makes me sad when I see posts from people sometime moving away from linux. In particular, One of my closest friend which I had converted earlier switched back to windows for some personal reasons and it really strained our relations. I don't convert others now but it was a significant part of my personality earlier and still recommend linux when people ask me for any tech advice about windows.\n I wish I was trolling with the above paragraph but I don't know I feel like I think too much about my OS.

          "description": "I found a little Trick when trying to dualboot OpenBSD when making a custom entry i couldnt find the EFI path since unknown file System but rage quitting after setting the root of the ESP booted OpenBSD this moment it hit me.\n Using GRUB as a UEFI Frontend for OpenBSD Booting\n Instead of making GRUB handle the full boot process for OpenBSD, you can use it as a simple frontend that hands off control to the UEFI bootloader. This is particularly useful because it eliminates the need to find the specific path to the EFI file, which can sometimes be tricky.\n How it works:\n GRUB lets you specify the root of the EFI partition where the OpenBSD bootloader resides.\n After setting the correct root, GRUB can simply exit, handing control back to UEFI.\n UEFI, which is already configured with the OpenBSD bootloader, will automatically boot OpenBSD.\n This method doesn’t change the boot order, and GRUB serves as a frontend, making UEFI boot the system without having to manually specify the EFI file path.\n GRUB Configuration: In your /etc/grub.d/40_custom file, add the following entry:\n menuentry \"OpenBSD\" { set root=(hd0,6) # Replace (hd0,6) with the correct partition for OpenBSD's EFI exit # Return to UEFI, which will boot OpenBSD }\n Explanation:\n set root=(hd0,6): This sets the root to the partition where the OpenBSD EFI loader is located. You should replace (hd0,6) with the actual partition that holds the OpenBSD EFI loader.\n exit: Instead of chainloading or directly booting the EFI file, this exits GRUB, returning control to the UEFI firmware. Since UEFI already knows how to boot OpenBSD from that partition, it will handle the boot process automatically.\n Benefits:\n You avoid the hassle of locating the exact EFI file path.\n GRUB becomes a simple interface for managing your boot options without having to configure complex boot paths.\n UEFI handles the actual booting, ensuring a more straightforward and error-free boot process.\n    submitted by    /u/Java_enjoyer07  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hi guys,\n If you look around, you will notice that many Linux distros, which are primarily aimed at “normal” desktop users, are based on Ubuntu. The most prominent examples here are probably Linux Mint, Pop!OS and Zorin OS.\n But why exactly is this the case? And why not use Fedora, for example, or, to give another example, OpenSuse? What makes Ubuntu better than the others?\n I did a bit of research into the differences between Fedora and Ubuntu and found the information that the packages in Fedora are more up-to-date and those in Ubuntu are often older or outdated. That would actually be a point in Fedora's favor.\n I have also had this experience. VirtualBox from the Ubuntu repositories is still on version 6.1 or so, the latest is now 7.0 or already 7.1 (I don't know exactly but definitely 7). And VirtualBox is the kind of software where you are forced to install it from there, because only then will it work. If you download it as a flatpak, you still have to set it up for the distro which is very complicated.\n Apart from that, you always find relatively different information about the two, such as that Fedora is supposed to be more stable than Ubuntu and has fewer bugs, whereas elsewhere you read that Fedora is supposed to be buggy. Then you read that Fedora is more complicated than Ubuntu, then somewhere else you read that both are equally simple. Just tons of information that somehow contradict each other.\n But there must be some reason why the people who wanted to bring out a new distribution thought they'd rather use Ubuntu as a basis than Fedora, for example.\n What exactly makes Ubuntu better than Fedora or other distributions? Or is Ubuntu actually not the best base for a distro and not worth the hype? What would be the best base then?\n    submitted by    /u/mi-wag  \n [link]   [comments]",

I could use a safe heaven for my files in the future. or let it be and see if there is a point i will need it? even though I got all the documents needed here on Linux. maybe I should sell it? i bet i can get a good 20-30$ out of it. yeah just want to know what are all your opinions about your old OS drives.\n edit: fixed typos\n    submitted by    /u/ParamedicDirect5832  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "After working on the issue of my broken Mute LED light for my HP laptop, I've managed to solve the issue through an admittedly hacky solution.\n Many HP Laptops have a light on the F6 key (or near there) which also functions as the Mute button when combined with the function key. It is a known issue this mute LED light does not work consistently across many models on Linux. I have put together information that I have gathered from deep searching the internet that works on my laptop model, an HP Pavilion Gaming Laptop 15z-ec0, with Realtek ALC285. This is not the only model that this solution works for, but I do not have a comprehensive list of models that this will work for.\n The script uses the following commands:\n To turn on the LED light:\n sudo hda-verb /dev/snd/hwC1D0 0x20 0x500 0x0B &&…",

The situation has changed slightly and I am looking to see if the plan I have would still work:\n  \nIn addition to the laptops we now also have a couple of old Server storage units with HDDs that its unknown if they have been cleared or not. \n \nThere is also some old Server Equipment that includes an HP Proliant DL360p and 2 Aruba 3810M Switches\n \n The original plan was to create a small local network with some daisy chained 8 port switches and detect and wipe the laptops using one as a control with an Ubuntu distro on it and use the following process to wipe the drives:\n  \nUse nmap to discover hosts on your network\n Use the results to populate an ansible inventory\n Use ansible to wipe the drive of every host in the inventory file\n Put all that on a loop in a small script\n  \nWhat I'm now wanting to know is if that I can use the above server equipment using the same above process on a bigger scale as I now have to take into account the storage units. \n Again we are doing this due to our own security concerns regarding the data, any help of direction pointing to learning materials is appreciated. \n    submitted by    /u/DrKatataFish  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hey folks!\n I'm Xavier and a solo game dev since 2017. I use Godot, Inkscape, Blender and Krita. I'm used to this subreddit, and I like to read it! I'm more of a lurker usually, but as I'm making games I have to talk about my games, so I post quite often on reddit but here! Because I know you folks, I know you're not looking for some shiny stuff, but for something that respect your privacy, because I'm one of you using Librewolf on Debian for example.\n Anyway, my journey started in 2017, and my first game released in 2019, while the second one didn't went well. I'm about to release my third game (april 7th 2025).\n I have a spare laptop that runs windows for some testing, and a VM that runs MacOS just in case, but all of my computers run either Debian or Raspbian. I host my code on a raspberry pi using Gitea, and I share most of the code I write on github/gitlab. I also contribute to some tools that I use (godot and terraform for example).\n Today is a really big day to me since Steam accepted to put one of my game on their front-page. From a game that had around 5 to 20 players, it went to almost 600! Selling over 5000 copies within 24h. That's crazy and I really want to thank you all for making this happen!\n Of course I work my ass off to make it happen, but I don't have enough time to make an OS as solid as Linux. I don't have enough time to make a game engine as great as Godot. I don't have enough time to make a tool as AWESOME as Inkscape (I really love this one). I don't have enough time to make a 3D tool/VCE/... as incredible as Blender! I'm just talking about those tools, but I could have talked about Librewolf, KDEPlasma, Terminator, nano, ssh, git, gitea ... all of those tools/libs are great and I'm glad they exist.\n Anyway, I'm sure this post is going to get buried but I really wanted to thank you all for making all of this to happen.\n Ask me anything (if you're still here obviously)\n    submitted by    /u/binogure  \n [link]   [comments]",

I chose Zorin OS as it's the first distribution that comes to my mind (besides Pop!_OS) for people coming from Windows.\n The Moment\n I only configured general stuff (like Chrome, etc.) for her a couple of days ago, didn't get the time to give her a tour of the new setup with Zorin OS. Today, she told me over the phone that she had to install Visual Studio Code using a setup file she had lying around, but she managed to get it working, which is what shocked me. She still has no idea why I was impressed, but when she showed me around how she actually did it, I saw that it was literally a Windows setup EXE and it worked just as it does on Windows, without her realizing it usually doesn't work that way in Linux, at least natively.\n Look How Far We've Come!\n Newcomers to Linux may not realize how back in the day we had to set up Wine ourselves and yet things weren't as streamlined as it appears to be now. But still, this kind of \"backward compatibility\" in a Linux distribution, and that too out of the box such that a Windows user doesn't even face a hiccup clearly demonstrates how far we've come with Linux, even for a long-time Linux user like me. To say that I'm impressed would be an understatement! Meanwhile, I do not understand why Zorin OS receives all the hate, and to me, it hasn't received the love it deserves.\n PS: Sorry for the long post, but I had to get this out!\n    submitted by    /u/myTerminal_  \n [link]   [comments]",

Nowadays, we have desktop environments, colorful and visually appealing applications, web apps, and social media. While it's impressive, I can't help but feel like the internet and computing in general have lost a bit of that 'wild west' charm.\n There's something fascinating, even mysterious, about interacting purely through text. It feels raw, direct, and oddly stimulating in a way that's very different from today's user-friendly graphical interfaces.\n So, I had this idea (though I haven't had the time to implement it yet due to work 😅): What if I stripped away all the modern graphical interfaces and returned to a fully command-line experience? Imagine surfing the web, talking to people, and interacting with the OS—all text-based, like the early days.\n Has anyone else experienced this feeling?

The process begins by reading filenames and their contents from the selected folder, the cosine similarity score (between -1 and 1) between each file's content is calculated to identify similar files based on a specified threshold. Files that are above the threshold are grouped as key-value pairs into a dictionary, where each key corresponds to a category or folder of similar files. Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) is then used to generate topic names for the contents in each category, resulting in the creation of corresponding folders names. These folders are appropriately named and the respective files are subsequently organized into them.\n The tool uses a pre-trained NLP model sentence-transformers/paraphrase-MiniLM-L6-v2 to understand the meaning of the data and calculate the cosine similarity.\n Links: Repo and PyPI\n End-user (you) can:\n  \nOrganize files within a selected folder or manually uploaded files (uploading files is only supported for GUI).\n Organize text-based files (.docx, .txt, .pdf, etc.) using NLP based on their content.\n  \nCustomization Options:\n  \nSimilarity Threshold: Allows you to choose a similarity percentage threshold for grouping similar files.\n Reading Word Limit: You can set a limit on the number of words to read from the file content.\n Folder Name Word Limit: You can specify a maximum number of words allowed in the created folder names.\n  \nThe GUI doesn't fail gracefully so it needs some updates that will come soon otherwise its perfectly functional but the CLI is completely finished and its efficiency will be improved as I work on it.

The compatibility issues with a lot of software can also be used against them trying to execute pirated games and the like, basically making it easier to control what they have access to.\n I know there are stories of how if you apply child protection time limits or website blocks they end up adapting and circumventing it...but if they do that with Linux, then they are also forced to learn how the system works well enough to familiarize themselves with programming knowledge which could help them in the future.\n    submitted by    /u/ChocodiIe  \n [link]   [comments]",

Tested on Firefox, LibreOffice, Gimp. Same SSD, different partitions.\n Incidentally, installing an app (LibreOffice again) on Linux does not require a reboot. I still can't believe that on Windows it does.\n Windows UI makes my eyes bleed and I can't do a thing about it without third party tools that are a can of worms in their own right.

Since I do it hundreds of times every day, it's a problem.\n  \nI'll stop at this point to reiterate that no, we are not seeing things and not trying to convince ourselves of Linux advantages.

I have no idea why I was so attached to it or afraid to to switch over to linux. I think at the time, security was a worry for me (what will I do without windows defender?! oh dear!) but I can see now that's a total non-issue as long as you have a functioning brain and a firewall.\n It was a really difficult decision for me between Zorin and Mint, and Mint only won out last minute. Mint (cinnamon specifically) just does everything I want it to without any of the bloat. All my mainstay games are compatible with a little tweaking and effort. It's beautifully simple and customizable. I'm not being advertised to every five seconds. \n This is a sign: if you're a newbie, and you're sick of microsoft but too nervous to make the switch, just do it. Go with mint. It works great, and there's a massive community there to help you just in case you hit a bump in the road. You'll be glad you did it.\n Edit: I'm sorry I exaggerated about how positive my experience was. I was having fun.

Previous projects like LlamaFS (https://github.com/iyaja/llama-fs) aren't 100% local and require an AI API. So, I created a Python script that leverages AI to organize local files, running entirely on your device for complete privacy. It uses Google Gemma2 2B and llava-v1.6-vicuna-7b models for processing.\n Note: You won't need any API key and internet connection to run this project, it runs models entirely on your device.\n What it does: \n  \nScans a specified input directory for files\n Understands the content of your files (text, images, and more) to generate relevant descriptions, folder names, and filenames\n Organizes the files into a new directory structure based on the generated metadata\n  \nSupported file types:\n  \nImages: .png, .jpg, .jpeg, .gif, .bmp\n Text Files: .txt, .docx\n PDFs: .pdf\n  \nSupported systems: Linux, macOS, Windows\n It's fully open source!\n For demo & installation guides, here is the project link again: (https://github.com/QiuYannnn/Local-File-Organizer)\n What do you think about this project?

It took 2 days because it had a windows device driver issue. I also made sure to get the digital license in my Microsoft Account. I used balenaEtcher to setup the install of Ubuntu. Started the install sharing the windows drive. Had to boot into windows and turn off bitlocker, including getting the boot unlocked via Microsoft.com. Started again had it get stuck while adding WiFI. Told it to just install without updates. It installed quickly.\n I was up and using Linux in under an hour. All the hardware works.

          "description": "Hey everyone,\n IDK if you have the same problems, but I had an idea that might make screen sharing on Linux a lot more secure and private. Picture this: you’re sharing your screen on Discord, OBS, or any other screen share app, and you accidentally reveal something you didn’t mean to—like passwords or private files. It’s a common concern, and I think there might be a way to address it.\n What if we had a feature where you could easily mark parts of your screen as “sensitive,” and the compositor would automatically blur or hide those areas during screen sharing or recording? For example, you could set up certain regions or windows to be censored so that they don’t show up in the recording or stream.\n On top of that, we could take it a step further with machine learning. Imagine having a system that can automatically detect sensitive information—like passwords, IP addresses, or credit card numbers—and blur those parts in real-time. This way, you wouldn’t have to manually mark everything; the system could handle it based on common patterns.\n Does this sound useful to anyone else? I’d love to hear your thoughts or any ideas on how that could work.\n Looking forward to your feedback!\n    submitted by    /u/sporesirius  \n [link]   [comments]",

There are so many responses and I didn't expect such a great discussion. All of you have enlightened me and made me come out of my comfort zone. I'm now eager to learn more.

You taught me to use WINE, fix my GNOME a few times, that Plasma is better in every way, that Fedora and Mint are the best for my every day...\n You taught me to fix SSD compatibility issues, how a filesystem works, how to make GRUB look pretty, and how not to fix a root folder issue (worked my system)\n But now, as I'm forced into using tools I hate by my university, I must say goodbye. Alas, the power of free software isn't anything to the power of the Spanish University System.\n Goodbye Linux, and I'll come back once my odyssey in Law ends.\n o7\n Edit: LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, I managed to get it working with a Win10 VM, somehow.

Now granted, I don't really know anything about photo editing or graphic design but based on what I read from people who do graphic design professionally, GIMP just isn't up to snuff as far as features and workflow even with the new 3.0 coming. \n I learned about Photopea a couple years ago and it looks a much better alternative to Photoshop as far as workflow and features (CMYK, smart objects, AI features). The issue I see people might have it with it is it being web based and proprietary though it does edit your photos offline and is big on privacy.\n With all this in mind, for graphic design people wanting to switch to Linux should we be steering them more towards Photopea rather than GIMP despite it being proprietary and web based?\n Keep in mind I ask this as someone who knows next to nothing about graphic design or photo editing, just a huge Linux enthusiast so I would be very interested to hear thoughts from people who know more than me and/or have used both Photoshop and Photopea.\n    submitted by    /u/jmantra623  \n [link]   [comments]",

When I got it, I immediately noticed this little display on the top of the PC, the XPS Miniview. I realized it didn't have any driver support past Vista and I disabled it and haven't thought about it until now. I'm wondering if there's a way to display content like the local IP, stats and usage, uptime, etc. on the display, and how I could go about doing that. Also if it's possible to get those arrow keys working... If anybody has any knowledge I'd appreciate it. Thanks for reading!\n TLDR: Home server has a tiny screen on top.

This is very irritating and definitely dangerous for our kernel stability!\n If you think this is too dramatic, a research from NASA proves that 60%-80% accidents are caused by human error in industry. Mostly due to humans' arrogance. Linux however, is now part of industry because most of us are relying on Linux. Especially for servers and routers. Imagine international-level internet outage caused by kernel bug. Linux community would be instantly die after that 😓\n So please stop... stop playing victim on each other.\n For Rust enthusiasts, if you think maintainers who still use C are resisting to give a \"good documentation\", that means they expect you to learn how those C source codes work then write a good Rust code from those. Same as when C devs are tried to learn how to code C based on reverse engineered binaries, or a hardware datasheet if lucky. Nothing is easy, no one want to spoon-feed you except you're a toodler. Simple as that.\n Anyway, I'm really sorry to say this long. This is my first time I wrote a long rant over something, because I don't want Linux to die.

I want to move away from Windows and macOS in my personal use cases. I've been experimenting with different distros and a couple different DE's and WM's, and I'm struggling to settle on anything. I've tried Arch and I've tried NixOS, Hyprland on both, KDE on both, but I want something that isn't going to be a complete slog setting up. My goal is to build an environment that's entirely my own that's fully functional.\n Arch is great, I like the idea of starting with a minimalist build and going from there. NixOS is also great, I love the idea of (potentially) a single configuration file, the self-contained package system, and the ability to roll back changes, but my config file is getting to be a behemoth, and I'm getting the feeling that it's a better server distro than desktop.\n I would like to be able to game and develop (I want to learn Rust or build a game with Godot), and I also have taught myself how to use Photoshop/Gimp and would like to be able to do that.\n So what are your thoughts?

What I think can help will be a community effort to make a one-stop destination for such recommendations. The inspiration for this post came to me after I saw the anime recommendation flowchart in r/anime.\n As a fellow Linux user for the past year, I definitely agree with whoever that says there isn't a one-size-fits-all solution for any of the aforementioned necessities, and the customizability is what gives Linux the advantage. But I also think that it's equally important to bring attention to promising software so that they'll receive more support in the form of issues, feedback and PRs, and it will eventually help improve the Linux experience altogether.\n Ofcourse what I'm implying is a good starter pack, so that the user can slowly try out others as they understand what they feel is lacking in their current software, and give feedback to the software on the way.\n    submitted by    /u/NoCoolSenpai  \n [link]   [comments]",

Linearting just does not feel as responsive on equivalent hardware. Fantastic for Painters though - but lacking for comic and Cellshading styles imo; in big part cause of weak selection and fill tools that I heavily use in such - lack of a \"Gap closing\" function being a big pain in the arse. Paintstorm pretty much solves all of that, I can go about just as fast as in Clip without having to do any manual adjustment.\n Only dealbreaker for some might be that Paintstorm is not FOSS - but well worth the cheap price tag to me.

          "description": "Hey everyone, \n A while back, I posted my Arch Linux guide covering full disk encryption with LUKS2, LVM2, Secure Boot, and TPM2 unlocking. For those who haven't seen it, the guide is here: Arch Linux install guide.\n Recently, someone pointed out a vulnerability in the setup that could allow an attacker to mimic the root partition using the same UUID to boot a rogue OS, then query the TPM for the decryption key.\n I've updated the guide with instructions on how to secure against this. If you're using TPM unlocking, I highly recommend checking out the update to make sure you're protected.\n Basically, how the protection works is by using systemd-measure to precalculate the hash value that's expected in the PCR 11 of the TPM during a specific boot phase enter-initrd. The boot process has several phases. And during each phase , the PCR11 is extended with the hash of the new phase. \n Now during boot , during the enter-initrd phase, the TPM checks for other values in PCR 0 , 7. It also checks that the value in the PCR11 matches the precalculated value by systemd-measure, and releases the key. After the enter-initrd phase, comes the switch-root phase. This extends the PCR11 again. Now if an attacker tries to query the TPM from the rogue OS, he will fail, because the PCR11 value doesn't match the precalculated value.\n Thanks to everyone who has supported the guide so far! If you find it helpful, a star on GitHub would be greatly appreciated.\n    submitted by    /u/_d3f4alt_  \n [link]   [comments]",

I tried Ubuntu/PopOS before but never as a standalone OS on my PC. I ALWAYS had Windows on backup if I needed it.\n Recent updates issues on Windows (black screens, stuff disappearing, glitches,...) got me extremely frustrated, and I decided to switch to Ubuntu completely. Not to mention the whole Recall situation that Microsoft wants to push.\n So, a quick question for those who have been in the game for so much longer. Is there anything I need to look out for and perhaps download to make my experience a lot better?

But for my job, occasionally I need to run full-fledged Word or Excel, and I'm used to PaintNET and Affinity Photo for high quality image editing that I do for publications, I also really like Wondershare Filmora video editor. I am debating which is the best alternative and wondering what other Linux users do in this situation?\n Dual-boot? A hassle having to jump back and forth between the two OS, not to mention having to keep up with Windows updates. I'd rather forget Windows exists as native OS.\n Wine/Proton? As of 2024 it still seems a convoluted process, pollutes your distro with Windows executables and libraries (eww) and of course there are no guarantees the specific app needed will run.\n Local virtual machine? - Not ideal if you are using a laptop on battery often as the performance overhead will drain the battery faster, also it just feels slow and thefore annoying to use.\n Cloud virtual machine? I never tried it before, I wonder what's the performance like, but surely it requires adding a monthly expense.\n RDP into a Windows PC? This is the one I am most inclined to, even though I don't have a separate desktop PC right now, but I tried Parsec to someone else's laptop and it really has low latency streaming if the connection is good, it's quite usable, more so than a virtual machine.\n Any other possibilities I am missing?\n    submitted by    /u/vanwaldi  \n [link]   [comments]",

I have a good laptop already for most of my side projects and gaming, so I figured I would turn the college laptop into a Linux machine. \n I've used Ubuntu and Raspbian (raspberry pi) before in the past, but for thos go, I was thinking about EndeavourOS or Fedora just to try something different. FWIW, I'm planning on using this laptop specifically to gain a better understanding of Linux and do a little bit of programming work, but it will not be my main work laptop. I'll probably connect it to my github account and play with a little assembly, C, C++, Python, and bash. Maybe a few other things. \n So what do you think? I'd appreciate any comments or ideas. Any cool things I could do with this linux laptop. Thanks!\n FWIW the laptop is a Dell Inspiron from probably 2017. i3 processor, 8GB ram, 2.4GHz, 1TB HDD.

What I didn't realize (gimme a break, I've been away from Linux for seven years) was that the q4OS Trinity was far from vanilla; in fact, the q4OS folks were kinda going out of their way to make it as close as possible to a legacy Windows experience, which explained a few things.

          "description": "One major issue with Linux distributions is that for each piece of software, there's a package for Debian, Arch, Fedora, Ubuntu, etc. Binaries are usually compiled dynamically linked (as opposed to statically linked), which means the libraries aren't contained in the binaries themselves, rather they're linked to system libraries. Therefore, you can't just run a binary from your Arch system on a Debian-based system. Many people say the solution to this issue is Flatpak, Snaps, and AppImages. These don't really address the real problem though. The actual solution is compiling statically linked binaries. This would also make it easier for developers to make binaries for Linux knowing they can be ran on any distribution.\n    submitted by    /u/SaltyMaybe7887  \n [link]   [comments]",

How it's so customizable to your like and taste. I'm not really a fan of Windows, I gotta admit. But so far, the advantages of Windows over Linux still kinda make me hesitant to really make the switch. Yeah, gaming is very doable now thanks to software advances with programs such as Wine and Steam's Proton. But unfortunately, some games still don't run on Linux, or they do, but not flawless. Especially multiplayer games which use anti-cheat software. Unfortunately some or most of them are apparently borderline malware, with how deep they can be nestled/rooted in the OS once installed. I've got an Nvidia graphics card, and though I found out there are linux drivers for them, I'm not sure how good it is compared to Windows. On my pc I've got Nvidia GeForce experience which neatly notifies me when there's a driver update. If I don't get a notification I just don't update. I don't want to manually check for updates every time I boot up my pc. Also I've already got plenty of stuff installed on my pc, and I'm not exactly thrilled if I have to reinstall all of it, if I switch to Linux. So far Microsoft haven't really done anything that I know of that made me determined to switch to Linux.\n    submitted by    /u/SpaceSloth707  \n [link]   [comments]",

Within this time-frame I used mostly openSUSE Tumbleweed and the latest Fedora.\n Well, the first laptop died within 3 years, and had some weird CPU spikes, and resume from suspend was hit or miss. Also I had to deal with broadcom drivers constantly breaking with kernel updates.\n The second laptop had frequent freezes causing the session to hang and require cold reboots. I tried several solutions and kernel parameters but the issue remained to this day. \n The third laptop, with RX dGPU, constantly flickers when connecting to a external FreeSync 144hz display.\n My most recent purchase was finally a Intel laptop with Xe graphics (LG Gram), and behold, I have none of these issues at all. Wayland, suspend and resume, external displays, battery runtime equal to Windows, all works great. It might be just luck with this particular model but honestly it made me regret my past purchases.\n Since then I have learned more about Intel active and timely contributions to the Linux kernel and I am hoping the layoffs won't cause that to decrease.\n Either Intel has been improving a lot these last few years or AMD has been overhyped, but the hassle free experience with a Intel laptop has made me hesitant with going to AMD+NVIDIA on my next desktop build, I am Seriously considering going with Intel CPU+Arc GPU.\n    submitted by    /u/vanwaldi  \n [link]   [comments]",

Currently trying Firefox but it is video playback on youtube is pretty laggy even if I have plenty of headroom on my CPU/GPU. I have also been noticing that it is unresponsive at times, I have to click a link sometimes 5 times to get it to actually register. Are there any realistic alternative browsers that aren't chromium based? I have looked around for posts about browsers but they all seem to just say \"use Firefox\".\n    submitted by    /u/NolanSyKinsley  \n [link]   [comments]",

Let me know if you have it!\n (Thanks to LordServerReset on X for the tip!)\n    submitted by    /u/MishaalRahman  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Screenshot.\n The reason this tile is needed is because some OEMs removed the AOSP Wallet Quick Settings tile as well as the Quick Access Wallet feature. And since Google Wallet itself didn't provide its own QS tile until now, you'd need to manually open the app or add a lock screen shortcut (if possible).\n With the dedicated Google Wallet tile, though, you can open Wallet from any page. You'll need to authenticate to open it from the lock screen, though.\n This tile has rolled out to at least one user, but I don't see it yet on my devices. According to the \"what's new in Google System Updates\" page, you'll need Google Play Services v24.33 or later for this feature, though it seems to be rolling out as part of a server-side update.\n Thanks to Petro on Discord for the tip!\n    submitted by    /u/MishaalRahman  \n [link]   [comments]",

This is found under Settings > Accessibility > Color and motion > Color correction. \n \nExternal display settings - a feature I spotted last month - is now live in Android 15 QPR1 Beta 2! When you hook your Pixel 8 or Pixel 9 series device up to an external monitor, you'll be able to change its display resolution or rotation under Settings > Connected devices. \n \nGoogle has announced that Android 15 QPR1 Beta 2 enables desktop windowing support on tablets like the Pixel Tablet. \n \nAndroid 15 QPR1 Beta 2 enables the lock screen widgets feature on the Pixel Tablet. More details can be found in my article on Android Authority. \n \nAndroid 15 QPR1 Beta 2 now lets you customize the look of the mouse pointer, so you can make it easier to see.\n \n What's in development for later\n  \nThe notification cooldown feature that used to be in the Android 15 preview - the one that stops notification spam - might be coming back in Android 15 QPR1. Here's a first look at its updated page in Settings. \n \nGoodbye Extra Dim, hello Even Dimmer! In Android 15 QPR1 Beta 2, Google is preparing to integrate Android's Extra Dim feature into the system brightness bar, so you don't have to remember to turn it off in the morning anymore.\n \n    submitted by    /u/MishaalRahman  \n [link]   [comments]",

I had my phone rooted for a long time because I like more control over my phone. Google has been slowly eroding that and now I can't even use RCS anymore because my bootloader is unlocked. The only 2 things keeping me here are notifications and firefox.\n Anyways, to elaborate on the headline instead of ranting: Tensor is not great for anyone who wants to do anything with videos. It takes so long to cut the length of a video. And when I was blocking out the kid face it took so long to save that video.\n https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8T7w7mzNqI8 here is a video showing how long it took to shorten \n https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8T7w7mzNqI8 here is how long it took to save.\n It is just really frustrating as when I want to send videos to my family it takes so long to shorten the extraneous parts. iPhones and even qualcomm chips are sooo much faster and I don't know I can in good faith upgrade to a $1,000 phone when performance on an every day task is so terrible.\n    submitted by    /u/rustid  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "本人在海外留学一直使用和法定中文名不同的 preferred name ，最近想在护照上加注自己的英文名，想请教下大家几个问题：\n护照加注英文名可以通过海外使领馆搞定吗？我之前看了微信公众号的一篇文章据说可以，但是会不会国内更方便/更快？在国内/在海外哪个更推荐一些？\n我看了下大致流程说需要“一些能证明你名字的资料”，这些资料是不是一定要像改名证明/姓名公证之类的法定文件才行？还是说平时一直使用这个名字的材料（比如参加活动的名牌、一些来往通信、非政府官方证件🪪等非法定材料）就行了？\n算是第二个问题的延伸，这些资料是不是一定要法定材料才行？如果是的话，那么护照加注是不是还得先去公证处做个证明才行？\n具体从开始申请到办好的时间需要多久？\n护照加注后可以把海外官方证件（比如驾照、学生证等，还有信用卡）换成加注的英文名吗？\n先十分感谢各位提供帮助🙏祝各位有美好的一天☀️",

          "description": "2024,0923-0929\n9 月 28 日，极简软件工作室成立 4 周年。\n9 月 29 日，结婚十周年纪念日。\n注册企业的时候没太注意日期，如果也是 9 月 29 日下证就更好了，一天两个纪念日。\nShipaton 结果\n周二凌晨 Shipaton 比赛结果出来了，不出意外，没有获奖。如果获奖了，那就是三个大喜了。\n但，说实话，很失望，消沉了一整天。唉，参赛报名时，嘴上说根本不在乎获奖，结果心口不一。\n一共有三个奖项，最有可能赚钱奖，最佳设计奖，最 build in public 奖，每个奖项有一二三等奖。最有可能赚钱这个奖我是真心压根没信心去拿下，但是后两个奖项我还真的期待能够获奖。特别是 build in public ，我第一周每天都拍个简短的 vlog ，后来嫌费时费力就改成了每周一个 weekly vlog 。\n最终获得 build in public 一等奖的是比赛期间一直在互相交流鼓励的一个印度小哥。我之前只关注了他的 X ，在比赛结果公布后我才知道，原来他每天都发一个进度视频到 YouTube ，难怪他拿这个奖了。得知自己获得了一等奖，他立刻买了机票飞去了旧金山，现场领奖，还参加各种研讨会，结识全球的优秀开发者，还参加播客录制，太羡慕了。\n在上架后直至比赛结束，我的参赛 App 一个付费也没有（实际上，截止到写这篇周记，也仍然是零收入），所以我希望能够通过获得任意一个奖项来助力 App 的宣传。\n诚如一个群友所说的，App 上架后只是第一步，只是九九八十一难的第一难而已。\niOS 18 的暑假作业\n这周终于有空来给极简时钟和极简日记适配 iOS 18 的新特性了，主要就是支持深色和着色下的 App 图标，再就是增加控制中心的小组件。\n今年的关于控制中心的适配，苹果的官方文档给的一点也不详细，最后还是靠 SO 和 Emote 的开发者的帮助下，才加入了这个新功能。\n新版本上架后，很快就收到了多个用户的反馈：iOS 18 以下系统的小组件都不显示了，而且也无法添加。同时也收到了几个关于这个问题的差评。调查了一番，才知道「判断系统是否是 iOS 18 」的这句代码居然会在 iOS 18 以下的系统里引起崩溃……进而导致整个 App 的小组件无法加载。解决方法在这里：# WidgetBundleBuilder crash on #available(iOS 18.0) check，不得不吐槽一下苹果的软件品控也着实越来越堪忧了。\nPhantom Types\n这周看了 Vincent Pradeilles 的新视频：# Don't write this code! (use a Phantom Type instead 😌)视频很短，讲的就是如何避免不同语义但是相同类型的实例进行比较，由此我第一次知道「 Phantom Types 」这个东西。\n搜了一下，原来几个知名的 Swift Blog 多年以前就都写过关于 Phantom Types 的文章了：\nSwift by Sundell ，# Phantom types in Swift\nSwift with Majid ，# Phantom types in Swift，# Building type-safe networking in Swift\nHacking with swift ，# How to use phantom types in Swift\n一直以来，我在自己的代码里很少使用 swift 的泛型，主要是自己认识水平不高，怕弄巧成拙。现在有了 AI 了，感觉可以大胆使用了。写代码的快乐很大程度上就来自于重构后的优雅啊！\n其他\n备案下来了，Nut Goals 在国区也上架了。\n读完了《蛤蟆先生去看心理医生》，顺便把相关的《人间游戏》和《人生脚本》加入了阅读清单。\n恢复户外步行，趁这个转瞬而逝的秋季。\n夜骑了一次 10 km 。",

          "description": "大家国庆快乐！我们有一套预生产环境的 k8s 集群，大概 15 个节点，master 有 3 台虚拟机，配置是 8c 16g ，内核是 3.10 的，平时内存使用率比较低，大概能用到不到 4g ，每台 etcd 数据目录也就几百 M ，但是目前这 3 个虚拟机用的虚拟化集群的存储性能非常差，导致大量 api-server 到 etcd 请求超时，iowait 也经常到 20-30 。目前没有更好的存储可以供我们使用（机械盘的共享存储），etcd 这边我在调了 ionice 后也没什么可优化的了，因此想分 2 到 3 个 g 的内存盘给 etcd 当存储盘用，然后再用 fsync+inotify 等工具实时将 etcd 写的内存盘的数据写回机械磁盘，也达到了异步双写的效果，而且只有 1 台宕机，只靠 etcd 的自己的机制只靠内存盘也能恢复回来（同时 down 2 台可能性非常低）。不知道大家觉得这个思路有啥弊端吗？谢谢！",

          "description": "使用 Ballast 文件解决 Docker 容器磁盘占满无法启动的问题\n背景\n在容器开发工作中，售卖算力容器是一个很常见的需求，不管是用 Docker 容器还是 K8s Pod\n交付。\n其中有一个问题是：我们提供给用户的容器默认是没有限制 / 目录的，虽然说这些都是临时文件，真正需要持久化的文件我们可以提供分布式存储，然后挂载到用户容器的某个目录。\n一个简单而有效的方式是使用 XFS 文件系统配合 --storage-opt 参数就能限制用户容器的 / 目录，也可以说是限制用户容器的系统盘大小。\n问题\n但是当用户长期使用一个容器，比如在容器里进行模型训练，会导致系统盘空间越来越小，当系统盘空间已经非常接近我们设置的大小时，例如限制系统盘大小为\n20Gi ，用户已经使用了 19.9999Gi ，这时候当用户 Stop 了容器（关机），再次 Restart/Start 容器（开机）时很可能会失败。\n报错信息如下：\nError response from daemon: mkdir /localData/docker/overlay2/7adae703b531d3e114cd171999e5502fe685e13835569b6f1d9fb31ab812773b/merged: disk quota exceeded \n\n这好像没什么好的解决办法，因为造成问题的原因是用户把容器当成了虚机来用，一般情况下我们也不会持久化用户容器的临时文件。\n但目前确实遇到了这个问题，所以和朋友一番讨论后，想出来了一个思路。\n实现思路\n前段时间研究了一下 Golang 控制 GC 频率的方法，其中使用的是 ballast ，就像下面代码中：\n初始化了一个生命周期贯穿整个 Go 应用的超大 Slice ，保证 GC 在 10G 的一倍时才被触发。\n详情参考这篇文章 性能优化 | Go Ballast 让内存控制更加丝滑\npackage main\n\nimport \"runtime\"\n\nfunc main() {\n\tballast := make([]byte, 10*1024*1024*1024) // 10G\n\n\t// do something\n\n\truntime.KeepAlive(ballast)\n}\n\n所以脑洞大开，我们能不能也用 ballast 的思想来为容器提供一个 ballast ，当容器磁盘不足时，我们手动减少这个 “压舱石”\n的大小，这样就能能保证容器关机后，再次重启时，不会因为磁盘不足，导致失败了。\n当然这样的操作是基于一个前提的，就是：\n无论如何都不应该删除用户容器里的任何东西，即使是日志或者垃圾文件。\n所以使用一个人畜无害的压舱石，可能是比较优雅的方式。\n坏处也很明显，就是用户可以删除这块压舱石，并且用户 df -h 看到的空间是和实际购买的不一样。\n具体实现\n用户开通容器时\n当用户开通一个容器，我们会限制用户容器的系统盘大小，比如说默认 20Gi\n的空间，但是通过程序开通容器时，我们使用 --storage-opt size 限制时会把系统盘大小设置为 20Gi + 5Gi ，5Gi 的文件作为一个\nballast （压舱石）存在于用户的容器中。\n当用户使用了 19.9Gi （实际情况下要比这个数字更接近 20Gi ） 的空间后，df -h 显示如下内容：\n$ df -h\nFilesystem                             Size    Used   \n/                                      25Gi    24.9Gi\n\n用户关机时\n重点在 Stop 时，如果说 Used 已经很接近 Size 了，那么我们就调整 ballast 的大小，保证用户容器正确启动。\n举个例子，当 Used 已经为 24.9Gi ，限制的大小为 25Gi ，我们 Stop 时，把 ballast 的大小减小 0.5Gi, 保证用户容器正确启动。\n源码地址\nballast-docker-container\n如果对你有帮助，请给我一个 Star ⭐️",

          "description": "大约从 7 年前自建变得越来越困难，我就开始使用 本地-->机场-->Vultr 小鸡的方式在科学上网。PC 使用的是 V2ray cli ，安卓用的 Kitsunebi ，手写自定义配置。但最近这个方式越来越不好用了，最主要的就是 Vultr 的 IP 风险等级非常高。AI Boom 以来各大网站都在加强反爬，现在 Vultr 的 IP 甚至直接无法访问 Reddit ，而同样因为 AI ，英文搜索出来的博客等网站被内容农场充斥（反而被 V 友们嫌弃落后的日本互联网幸存，现在依然有许多高质量且频繁更新的博客），所以 Reddit 之类的 social media 反而成了高质量信息源，因此最近不得不越来越多地直接使用机场出口，Vultr 每月的$5 都浪费了。于是我今天在 V2EX 和 hostloc 搜了搜，但自己从碎片信息研究越研究越乱，Nekobox ，Hysteria2 ，trojan ，sagernet ，wireproxy ，xray 等等等等越来越搞不懂了，希望有人能指点一下。\n我现在主要是两方面的问题：\n1 、落地如何选择？我大概想到 4 种\n- 放弃中转方案，机场直接落地。缺点：审计（主要是 BT ，禁 P2P 我理解，但走 HTTP 的 web source 也不行）、IP 共用多、IP 跳\n- 维持现状 Vultr 小鸡。能解决上面列的缺点（有人说 Vultr 禁 BT ，但我用了快 8 年了从没有任何问题。我非法 BT 用的不多，却也用过 Vultr JP 下日本动画，并没有收到任何警告）。问题是它的 IP 虽然固定，风险等级实在高，而且它的价格放到机场里能升一个 Tier ，或者加个备用，体验都会好很多，感觉这$5 每月实在浪费。\n- Warp+。在 V2EX 和 hostloc 都看到不少人说这个。缺点：wireguard 是 UDP ，机场可能不支持，限速，以及使用 V2ray 等 UDP over TCP 方案导致性能不好。\n- Seedbox 等送的 VPN ，一般基于 OpenVPN 。毕竟是送的属于是不用白不用，而且支持 BT 。\n2 、客户端\n- 自建小鸡最成熟，我自己也最熟悉，继续我现在的方案或用 Clash Relay 都行。\n- Wireguard （ Warp 用的协议） Nekobox 和 sagernet ，wireproxy 等都能较简单地支持，Nekobox 还支持手机，总体来说还是比较简单的。\n- OpenVPN 就难了，我没找到任何关于这个的。我之前自己有弄过，但手机不知道该怎么弄。\n- 最关键的问题：怎么分流？比如说我偶尔想在手机上用 Seedbox 送的 VPN 下个小种子，有办法给 BT 专门分流吗？这些送的 VPN IP 都很差，我肯定是不会长期用的。Warp 不能解锁的流媒体，有办法分流到机场去吗？ TG ，推特等风控严的，有办法固定好 IP 吗？\n我现在感觉好像直接机场是不是已经是最好的了？机场的 IP 虽然会变，但固定国家问题应该不大吧？而且机场 IP 风险等级可比我现在的 Vultr 小鸡好太多了，风控这东西也是个黑盒子，自建的风险等级高和机场的 IP 变动+共用，不好说哪个影响大。BT 又该怎么办？我 BT 走代理主要是从 web source 走 HTTPS 协议下，不需要 BT 协议，也不需要和 tracker 联系，有没有什么办法走机场？这些问题我自己真的是越想越糊涂，希望有人能指点一下。",

          "description": "目前根据各家自媒体的测试，以及我去 Apple store 进行的尝试，可以确认以下 2 个事实。\n1.国行 iPhone 可以在 Qi2 模式下，以 360khz 实现 25w 快充；\n2.国行 Apple Watch S10 ，兼容磁力快速充电器（ A2515 ），比国行特供充电器快，但是依旧无法实现快充；（本人也去 Apple Store 尝试过用自己的 S9 插到展示机的充电器上可以充电，说明目前展示台并非新款国行定制充电器，也侧面印证了国行 S10 可以使用非定制线进行充电）\n根据国家无线电频率划分规定，苹果做了如下措施应对：\n1.规定只限制发射端，不限制接收端，且 iPhone 支持有线充电方式，Qi1 充电的频率也符合国标，所以针对 iPhone ，苹果的处理简单粗暴，不上架新款 25w magsafe （不排除目前在售的 magsafe 会不会在将目前存量的销售完成后，也会调整为 7.5w 的 Qi 版），手机的充电模块不做任何调整；\n2.因为 Apple Watch 仅支持无线充电，且 Apple Watch 的 2 个充电频率均不在国标允许的范围（ 326.5 kHz & 1.778 MHz ），苹果不得已给国行做了特供版 Apple Watch 和特供版磁力充电器。\n以下为个人基于官网 info ，及上述自媒体对于 Apple Watch 的一点猜测：\n1.Apple Watch S7 开始支持快充，且增加了一个频率 1.778MHz ，推测 Apple Watch 的快充是工作在 1.778MHz 下；\n2.A2515 快速充电器兼容 S1 到 S6 的表，推测 A2515 也支持发射 2 个频率（ 326.5 kHz & 1.778 MHz ）；\n3.国行 Apple Watch S10 使用特供版充电器速度最慢，使用 A2515 稍快，但仍然达不到外版的充电速度。推测 Apple Watch 的线圈设计仅能同时支持 2 个频率。国行增加了一个新的符合国标的频率（可惜没找到国行相关参数的页面），同时为了保证更好的兼容性，保留了 326.5 kHz 的慢充频率，去掉了 1.778 MHz 的支持。\n所以在使用 A2515 等充电器的情况下，会以 326.5kHz 频率工作，充电速率倒退到 S6 ；如果用特供充电器，充电速率甚至不如 S6 。\n4.国行 A2515 仍在销售，但是根据国标要求，推测在销售完目前生产的，也会下架。\n参考资料：\n1.S9 info\nhttps://cdsassets.apple.com/live/6GJYWVAV/information/locale/en-gb/ma2159_apple-watch-s9-info.pdf\n2.S6 info\nhttps://cdsassets.apple.com/live/6GJYWVAV/information/locale/fi-fi/ma1955_apple-watch-s6-hermes-watchos7-info.pdf\n3.S10 info\nhttps://cdsassets.apple.com/live/6GJYWVAV/information/locale/ar-sa/apple-watch-s10-info.pdf",

          "description": "因为想把工作和日常生活分开，所以准备了两个微信号。\n一开始是两个 iphone 双持（ 15 pro + 13 mini ）\n但是每天带两个手机真的有点麻烦，而且另外一个手机的消息不能通过 apple watch 提醒，容易漏消息\n折腾了一下，目前的双开基本没啥问题了。\n自签微信\n在网上找了原版仅砸壳的 ipa ，没有添加插件，用 sideloadly 自签，仅修改了包名，然后设置 iphone 无线连接 mac ，更新签名就可以通过 wifi 连接，不用连数据线，基本无感。\n通知转发\n自签的微信不挂后台没有通知，比较简单的方法是用一个安卓平板，同时登陆平板微信和手机微信，然后用 bark 转发消息，但是我有 ipad 了，也不想专门买个安卓平板，成本又高，供电也是问题。\n正好有一个黑苹果小主机，在 mac 端登陆微信（工作原因不需要在电脑上登陆微信，所以不会被挤下线），通过 python 脚本，读取 mac 的微信通知，通过 bark 转发到手机上。\n这个脚本还比较简陋，如果有需要我可以放到 github 上面，然后 mac 需要设置不锁屏（锁屏了好像就没有通知了）\n目前测试了一周，消息转发很及时，延迟在十秒左右。\n通知跳转\n因为是通过 bark 发送消息，点进消息会自动跳转到 bark 而不是微信，所以通过 bark 自定义 url 的功能，先用用 url 调起快捷指令，然后用快捷指令调起工作微信，实现点击 bark 消息可以自动打开工作微信的效果。\n这部分目前还存在的问题是，通过快捷指令调需要跳转两步，如果都没挂后台的话需要唤醒 bark 和快捷指令两个 app ，效率较低。考虑过修改工作微信的 scheme 来实现一步直接跳转，但目前还不知道如何在 sideloadly 中修改。\n关于封号\n登陆自签的微信后，电脑端的微信最开始两天每天早上被踢下线，后面几天就一直正常了，没有用插件的话，应该还好",

          "description": "尊敬的 V2EX 朋友们：\n我的母亲被银行工作人员诱导购买了大量保险，导致其耗尽毕生积蓄和退休金。今年九月，家人才偶然发现这一情况，整理保单和家庭收入后，发现她仍需缴纳大额保费给银行，且可能存在 9 万元的资金缺口难以填补。\n浏览了社区类似经历的主题后，花了 9 天时间跟银行协商、跟监管部门投诉，希望能取回本金，解除合同。但银行一直不予正面回应，也不愿协助调查。感觉疲惫不堪，因此希望向各位有见识的朋友寻求帮助（必有酬谢）\n以下是事情的概要：\n事件经过\n妈妈 10 年前就开始买理财和保险了，银行经理推荐她买的都是些很抽象的产品（约等于年利率仅 0.6%的 5 年定期存款）。\n近些年银行经理可能感觉妈妈这只羊很好薅，于是诱导妈妈购买了多份高额保险，包括 5 份终身寿险、1 份年金险、多份长期保险（最长的 24 年到期）。这些产品收益低得搞笑；而且 10 年内想取回钱，不仅没有收益，反而损失很大。\n维权困境\n律师咨询：无果，保险合同有效。\n银行方面：请求其提供双录等关键证据，被无视。坚持要求已对银行产生心理阴影的妈妈去面谈。\n政府部门：都建议找 12378 。\n12378 投诉：投诉单（包括诉求）被原封不动地转交给银行，并且在前天就结案了。\n现状\n银行在 9 月 21 日就说“正在核查销售过程”，然后说“跟保险公司一直在沟通”，但至今没有告知任何进展、信息，也不给协商方案。\n跟银行询问了两次，问能不能在 12378 委托独立调解组织来调解，银行都不予理睬。\n银行反复要求妈妈去面谈。把授权委托书发给银行后（妈妈授权我全权处理），银行委婉地质疑之前的沟通是否反映妈妈的真实意愿（实际上是真实的），更加要求妈妈亲自去见面。但是看妈妈现在的状况，恐怕很容易被击垮、被忽悠。\n妈妈拿不出任何证据，被银行的人忽悠的时候没录音。\n今天银行说可以“推荐一个专业的银行业调解机构”，12378 上的调解机构他们又不认可，请问这样是有陷阱吗？\n恳请帮助\n面对银行的推诿和自身的无力，恳请 V2EX 的朋友们能够伸出援手：\n如果您有类似经历或了解相关法律法规，请不吝赐教，您的每一条建议都弥足珍贵。\n如果您知道如何有效维护自身权益，如何与银行进行交涉，也欢迎您慷慨分享您的经验。\n银行工作人员的可疑操作\n提供误导性信息，夸大收益。\n规避监管： 将口头宣传、付款和合同签署分开进行，只在合同签署时录音录像\n使用煽动性语言： 利用“存款没利息”、“内部人员都在买”、“产品即将下架”等话术，制造紧张气氛，迫使母亲决定。\n阻挠家人知情：暗示妈妈“不要麻烦子女”。\n混淆概念：将购买保险与存款简单类比，使妈妈误以为自己的行为跟将钱存进银行一样。\n代填虚假信息： 替妈妈在合同上代填年收入等信息，且明显高于实际情况。\n即使妈妈明确说会提前解除保险合同（“三五年内就要用钱”），仍然隐瞒提前解除保险合同可能产生的损失。\n酬谢\n有帮助的回复必点感谢\n如果这事能顺利解决，给 V2EX 朋友们奉上大红包\n万一还能拿到利息的话，一定跟妈妈商量，利息大头归朋友们",

OPPO 账号的隐私问题\n当用户注册并注销 OPPO 账号后，尽管系统会对部分信息进行处理，但当前注册的资料（如手机号）仍然可能与账号相关联。\n在某些情况下，虽然系统对敏感信息做了部分屏蔽处理，但通过其他手段，仍有可能获取到注销后账号的部分关键信息，带来隐私泄露的风险。\n\n2. vivo 账号的严重隐私风险\n如果用户忘记了 vivo 账号，只要掌握用户的身份信息，通过验证身份信息，vivo 系统会将用户的账号和手机号展示出来。\n尽管 vivo 系统会对手机号的中间四位进行隐藏，但这些信息通过社会工程学手段非常容易被获取。\n更严重的是，当重新输入 vivo 账号时，系统会直接显示用户的实名信息的前两个字母，这在某些实名制的场景下可能会带来安全隐患。\n\n3. 与厂商沟通的反馈\n针对此问题，我曾与 OPPO 客服沟通过，但目前该问题似乎仍然没有得到妥善的处理，风险依旧存在。\n目前只发现 OPPO vivo 存在一定风险，不知道其他手机厂商是否存在，说实话为什么现在手机厂商不会倾听用户的建议",

          "description": "事情是这样的：老程序员一名，因为想回老家发展（孩子出生了，不想跑太远），在老家找了一份工作。其实当时犹豫了挺久的，主要原因有以下几个：\n我觉得工作内容没有上一份好（上一份工作主要是 AIGC 相关的，目前这一份就是硬件相关的自动化测试。）\n薪资月薪比上一份降低了 3K ，但是年终多了几个月。\n主要是怕目前这份工作内容太坑，但是胜在可以 955 。\n在犹豫期间还拒绝过，但是对方居然在 base 上加钱了（虽然不多，就几百上千）。当时还觉得对方还挺有诚意了，就接了目前的这份工作的 offer 。\n几个月工作下来，虽然确实比上一份工作枯燥，就是写写自动化脚本啥的，也从来没有在这份工作上获得过成就感，组内的编程水平也明显感觉比较低。（可能就是老家跟一线城市确实有差距吧）但是胜在可以 955 ，每天准时下班，所以整体下来感觉还不错，以为就这样可以安定下来。但是戏剧般的事情就在这个时候发生了：我的+1 居然提了离职，然后我的手下也被炒了。我们整个组也就几个人，这样下来我负责的项目就剩下我一个在干了（原本是+1 ，我，我 1 个手下在干）。\n然后我还没请陪产假，打算准备请的，但是碰上他们的离职期了，需要交接，现在都不知道能不能休了，因为我休了项目就停摆了。\n除此之外，我感觉+2 定下来的目标不可能完成，且他不懂技术，且他的目标可以说是乱定的！！！我对这里也没有归属感，技术氛围也很那啥，连我自己都可以当技术领头羊那种。对我而言这份工作就是上下钟。现在回想起来，上一份工作还是很快乐的，很有成就感，但是买不起一线城市的房啊 T T\n所以，我该跑路吗？重新找一份自己认为工作内容可以的？还是先苟着然后看看自己早下班发展点兴趣/副业？ 有点迷茫，大家支支招，谢谢～\nP.S. 第一次发帖，不知道格式，也不知道是否表达得清楚，如果有什么疑问，大家问了我再补充哈，见谅。",

          "description": "我工作需要用到内外网，然后内外网电脑是隔离的，平时如果要转移文件必须使用专门的加密安全 U 盘进行传输，比较麻烦。前段时间在 github 上看到 cimbar 这个项目 https://github.com/sz3/libcimbar ，大概意思是在纯离线情况下通过二维码来传输文件，我自己试用了一下，传输速度和效果不错，虽然我自己试了下只有十几 M 以下的文件可以比较顺利地编解码，但对于我办公用的大多就是 word 、图片和小型 PDF 来说够用了。\n但问题是这个项目二维码编码给了一个本地网页，二维码解码只给了一个安卓 APP 。这样的话，我只能用这个工具从内网传文件到外网，因为外网我用手机可以安装这个解码 APP ，但无法从外网传内网。\n看了下项目介绍和 issues ，作者在 23 年就提到说准备着手做一个电脑上能用的解码工具，但似乎一直没有进展。我现在想的是能不能曲线救国。\n一是在内网上装安卓模拟器，再在安卓模拟器里装这个解码 APP ，但安卓模拟器好像会创建虚拟网卡，感觉内网桌管系统会报警，不知道有没有规避方法或纯离线的安卓模拟器。\n二是项目主页上提到可以自己构建，但我对计算机编程基本没基础，看了半天似乎也很难实现。而且我看了下它构建的项目似乎不是调用摄像头而是直接调取图片，没看懂既然文件都没传过来怎么调取图片。\n希望有大手子帮忙看下这个项目在我这种情况下能够怎么使用，我感觉这个项目非常适合我的工作，平时内外网传文件折腾 U 盘，输加密密码耗时耗力，这个通过摄像头就能传文件真太有创意了。",

          "description": "先说一下本人情况，双非本 985 硕，本科期间对编程非常感兴趣，同时也拿了很多国家级比赛的一等奖，最后也成功保研到某 985 学校。研究生期间花了大概两年时间琢磨科研，最后因为某些原因最终放弃了在学术道路上继续前进，收获了一篇二区论文和若干竞赛奖项。\n我在本科和研究生期间一直有个大厂梦，也为此付出了极大的努力，最终在研究生期间如愿去了某不知名大厂实习了一段时间，实习期间最大的感受是，难道这就是我一直追寻的大厂吗？这段实习经历并不快乐，因为入职时正值组内动荡期，因此被领导和导师当做牛马使，很多时候得干到十点多才可以回家，周末也不愿意出去玩玩，只想宅在自己的小房间玩玩游戏，吃吃零食，看看动漫。\n实习结束后，导师问我愿不愿意转正，我想了很久还是拒绝了。拒绝的原因有很多，首先是我自认为不够聪明，身边的同事不仅比我更聪明而且能在工作上付出比我多太多的时间。其次是工作的内容不太喜欢，每天的任务就是写一些比较基础的业务代码，我们组的前景我觉得也不太明朗。最后就是感觉互联网已经过了那个野蛮生长的时期，我想要取得像我领导那样的成就基本上是不太可能了。当然还有一点就是感觉实习的这段时间里，我已经完全没有同事之外的社交了，整个人也长胖了七八斤，如果继续在互联网行业，感觉自己很难找到一个能相守一生的另一半(我真的有点恋爱脑)。\n因为十分恐惧秋招签的公司比实习时候还要离谱(当然还有个原因是懈怠了，实习结束在家休息了两个月)，于是觉得 all in 国企，希望能在国企里 wlb 。秋招期间投了数不清的国企与央企、最终选择了一个自认为还不错的企业，薪资水平基本上是在大厂转正后的 1/3 左右，不过基本上能保证 955 。\n目前已经在公司里干了快一个半月了，因为某些原因基本上都干的是些办公室的活，等这段时间过去，可能需要转型成项目经理，偶尔会带着一些外包同事干活，主要负责协调和监督。还有个比较出乎意料之外…",

          "description": "这个工具原本是我上个产品的补充功能，后来用的人越来越多，索性给它独立出来了。\n开发背景\n酷狗概念版和波点音乐一直都有组队领会员活动，达成组队可以领取若干天数的音乐会员。每月 2 期组队活动，可同时发起组队和加入组队，等于一个月可以领 4 次会员。但是活动限制每期组队成员不能与上期一致，导致用户需要到处拉人，这个工具就应运而生了。\n主要功能\n提供海量的队伍池，用户可随时加入正在进行中的组队\n支持提交组队链接，根据用户点击动作判断有效使用率\n用户规模\n截至今天：酷狗概念版达成队伍 5300 个，约 15000 人；波点音乐达成队伍 940 个，约 3700 人。\n关于推广\n我的上个产品目标用户是网易云使用者，并积累了一些用户。但后来我发现压根不是这么回事，两边 APP 的用户画像几乎对不上，导致我几发炮弹全打棉花上了。接着我依据画像数据的大致走向，判断豆瓣的用户群体比较符合目标。我尝试联系一些大组的管理并得到一些支持，使用量渐渐上来但依然没达到我的预期。\n没办法，要憋大了。\n我在开发这个工具前，就建立过比较完善的私域链路（公众号-企微-社群），其中社群运营约 2W 人。接着我开始有针对性的策划类似“种草有奖”活动，并招募一些人在 xhs 进行笔记海投。由于我的人几乎都是素人博主，第一波并不理想；后来我加班做了些笔记模板作为参考案例，曝光转化逐渐攀升。至少目前不用我去拉队伍，主动提交队伍的用户量足够支撑工具的正常运转。\n至此，我决定单独给这个工具拎出来取了个名字：饭团组队\n后续\n其实此工具还有一些可深挖的地方，比如：组队成功提醒、队长互组等；受当时思维的局限性未能考虑进来。加之我主要是做用户运营的，如果你看到我画的页面，就知道此人是个野生产品。站在我的角度，我更多的是考虑：如何短时间内利用需求去造势（当时有个平台组队活动做的很大）。因此该工具在进行代码生产的时候，我就提前筹备了公域-私域的链路转化工作，N 个运营策略，迭代再迭代。这也是开发老哥愿意不厌其烦的帮我搞定代码的原因之一。\n最后放上这个小工具，移动端访问效果要好些：饭团组队\n使用教程做了个海报，图太大就不贴了，可点此查看\n若有使用问题可留言或联系：ZHJpbmt0ZWE3Ng==\n最后，祝各位老哥的产品都能爆！",

          "description": "性格比较宅，这段时间工作又比较忙，基本上都是两点一线，也就很少出去玩了。\n这个周末终于空闲了一下，决定还是出去走走吧。在地图上随便看了看，决定去西山岛转转。一来它在苏州，距离上海并不远，开车两个小时就能到，二来看中它的与世隔绝，它是位于太湖中间的一个小岛，只有一条笔直的公路可以进岛。\n忙了一大段时间后，如果突然停下来，就会变得很空虚了，有一大段时间但不知所措。这时候就会怀疑自己，得到一些悲观的情绪。\n找地理上的与世隔绝，就是想暂时隐藏自己一下，自我暗示可以放松了，就像是一只鸵鸟，把头埋进沙子里。\n晚上 7 点多开车出发，全程都是高速，发现越是靠近苏州市区，路上的灯也就越亮，路况也就越好。\n下高速时，基本上就是进岛的路线了，有一条长长的笔直的公路，两边都是湖水，由于是深夜，所以两边都是黑漆漆的，但可以感觉到两边的宽阔，进岛公路也修的特别好，除了机动车道，还有栏杆围起来的非机动车道，还有一层是行人道。进到这条公路，一下子就变得特别的安静，大桥上三三两两的有人聚在一起，有的还摆好了烧烤架，有的则是架好了鱼竿，准备钓条大的。\n住的地方是一处自建房，装修的特别西式，大片的白色墙壁，门口还有一个小型的游泳池。到达目的地时，老板还在别处忙，一个老大爷（目测是老板的父亲吧）牵着一条是老大爷的拉布拉多（ 13 岁），拉布拉多性格温顺，对客人热烈欢迎，他那个大嘴巴，大舌头舔的我的手一手的口水，还有点黏糊糊的，弄的主人还有点不好意思了:快去厨房洗个手。\n早上 7 点起床了，决定先把今天的跑步任务完成，早上天气比较凉爽，马路上也没有什么车子，绕岛的周围小跑了 10 公里。周围就是太湖，一望无际，感觉就像是在海边跑步一样。我可能天生喜欢视野开阔的感觉，每天生活在城市里，钢筋水泥，摩天大楼组成的钢铁森林，很容易就从生理上觉得压抑和不适。在这种空旷的地方跑步，脚踩在土地上，跑完步，感觉手和脚都很暖和，心脏还在刚才的运动中一点一点的平缓，这时候很清晰的感觉到它的跳动，感觉自己确确实实的在活着。走累了，就站在湖边，对着湖打喊一声，在这里你可以肆意呐喊，内向人的福音，不会有人觉得你很奇怪。\n离开民宿后，我们驱车前往缥缈峰，《天龙八部》里天山童姥居住的地方就在缥缈峰，不知道是不是取材于此。其实它就是一个小山，一条山道直接从山脚通到山顶。站在山顶，可以俯瞰整个岛的全貌，如果天气比较好，可以看到太湖更远的地方。只可惜，今天天气不好，只能看到近处的湖面，波光粼粼，一道道波纹里藏着金光。\n接着是林屋洞，大热天的，山洞里很清凉，还有潺潺溪水。\n大概到下午四点多，眼看着岛的上空布满了一层厚厚的乌云，应该就是要下大雨了，就准备驱车离岛了。",

          "description": "我在今年一月离职，今天入职了新公司。\n当时工作压力很大，看到周围的人陆陆续续活水或离职，女朋友也支持我，于是我也下定了决心，裸辞。那时候我工作了一年半，想着我存款多，有猫猫，有爱我的女朋友，怕什么。于是义无反顾地往前走，不知道接下来的半年会那么难熬。\n女朋友在上海找到了实习，于是我们和猫咪一起从北京搬到了上海，这时是二月份。\n我一直对互联网很感兴趣，反正也辞职了，索性做了一个工具类的产品，二月份就上线了第一版，在 reddit ，product hunt ，hacker news 上推荐自己。结果当然是像大多数人一样，我没有做出改变世界或者至少改变一个小行业的产品的能力，几乎处于无人问津的状态。那段时间也凭借缘分面了一两个公司，理所当然地告吹，不过我完全没有在意。我们领养了第二只猫咪，跟她的姓，哈哈哈。她给我带饭，带可乐，我的吃喝全仰仗着她。这样一直到了 5 月份。\n5 月 6 号那天，女朋友提出了分手，我们前前后后总结了更改添加了很多分手的理由，难以捉摸。我或许隐隐约约有一些预感，不过似乎没有把它和分手联系在一起。突如其来的晴天霹雳，哭啊哭一连哭了好几天。\n后来去了上海精神卫生中心看病，不严重，医生让我多运动。于是我每天下午晚上出门遛弯，至少从表面上好点了。这段时间有用户给我发消息，说或许我可以为我的产品收费，我也想看看我能否靠它养活自己，于是添加了收费的功能，陆陆续续维护到现在，它给我挣了 1000+美元。\n浑浑噩噩到了七月，我下定决心开始疯狂找工作，注册了 boss 直聘，天天看有没有人招工。字节二面挂完一面挂，阿里二面挂，蚂蚁三面挂完 HR 面挂，携程一面挂。9 月份终于让我找到了现在的工作，跳去了前司的竞对，造化弄人。\n前两天台风过境，我刚刚搬了家，离开了伤心又留恋的地方，开始了新生活，外面呼啸的狂风框框作响的门框没有吓到我，也没有吓到我的猫咪，我和它相依为命，希望靠台风一扫过去的阴霾。\n今天是入职的第一天，晚上回到出租屋，记流水账一样记下了也许在多年后回头看是改变人生的转折点，不过现在谁知道呢？马上就 12 点了，洗洗澡睡睡觉，明天终究还是要向前看。",

          "description": "最近一年，在我身上发生了很多事情。最重要的莫过于和谈了一段时间的女朋友结婚了，也买房了。在这之后，各种一地鸡毛的事情也开始接踵而至。双方家庭内部乱七八糟矛盾、夫妻之间的矛盾、原生家庭和小家之间的矛盾、因为房贷而带来的对失业的恐惧….这一切让我感觉都非常地陌生，仿佛一年之前，这些都与我无关。而我的人生轨迹也在这一年被彻底地改变了。 \n最近也一直在想，人生的意义是什么？人为什么而活着？莫非人生来就是为了去读书的苦、在吃工作的苦、婚姻的苦和生离死别之苦吗？ \n让人窒息的原生家庭环境、每次吵架都歇斯底里日渐支离破碎的感情、 越来越糟糕的工作环境…感觉自己才 30 岁不到，就像已经死了一样，心里看不到一点光。有时候很鄙视自己像个生活的懦夫，只知道抱怨….可是我明明已经够努力了，为什么生活还是这么一团糟？ \n以前我很鄙夷那些轻生的人， 毕竟能有什么事情是能够超越死亡的？直到我亲身经历一些事情之后，我仿佛也能理解了。有时候他们可能也只是不愿再去遭受那些让他们感到痛苦的一切。毕竟让我再选一次，我也不会再选择出生、结婚、买房。",

          "description": "2024 ，0909-0915\n这个周记的标题一改再改，因为被拒的次数不断增加。\nGoogle Play 账户验证\n这周一次性通过了 Google Play 的身份验证和银行账户验证。\n之前听闻有的开发者卡在这里好久，提交各种资料就是不能通过。我也害怕这种事发生在我身上，好在没有。就是按照要求提交了身份证、水电费和银行流水，就直接通过验证了。\n\n虽然来自 GP 的收入一直在下降，但是也是目前收入的重要组成的一部分，占到美元收入的差不多四成左右。\n上周有人留言要买我的账号的 App ，向群友请教了一番，结果并不能卖多少钱，连一两特斯拉 Model Y 都不够。算了，还是别杀鸡取卵了。\nShipaton 第五周\n距离截止日期还剩 3 天。\n第五周生产力大爆发，一共完成了 56 个番茄钟，是最多的一周！\n\n因为马上就要到 deadline 了，为了能够顺利提交 App ，不得不又砍掉了一个 Jar Type 。剩余的工作就是 UI 调整，修复 bug ，加入动画和声效以提高交互性。设计师列了几十个 UI 调整事项，还好我很快就完成了大部分，一天发四五个 TestFlight 的 build ，只剩几项我认为比较费时就先搁置了。\nhttps://youtu.be/F12HzTVRrT0\n连续被拒 6 次\n终于，周五下午四点提交了第一版，没想到过了 30 个小时才进入审核。整个周六的精神状态都是心不在焉的，什么都干不进去，总在期待收到审核结果的邮件，然后意料之中地被拒了。第一次被拒的原因还好，只是元数据的问题，填补后顺便修复了一个小组件的问题第二次提交（周六晚上）。\n在等待审核的间隙，完善了 Ship-A-Ton 的各种资料，还第一次用 Rotato 录了一个演示视频。\nhttps://youtu.be/IRKSo2Txclc\n然而，第二次被拒就是周日下午了，直到午夜连着拒绝了五次……\n\n第二次被拒的原因：Paywall 页面里缺少付费后用户得到的功能或服务（我选择的这个 Revenue Cat Paywall 模板没有关于付费解锁内容的配置）。\n第三次和第四次被拒都是同样的原因：说是 Paywall 页面无法加载，影响用户付费体验。但我这个 Paywall 是 RevenueCat 提供的，加载过程不由我控制，RC 的建议就是如果一切配置没问题的话，那就是苹果审核环境导致的，没有其他办法，只能是一遍遍的重复提交。\n第五次被拒的原因：页面存在难以阅读的文字。其实就是 Onboarding 部分的大段文字颜色有些浅，而且在小屏幕的手机上会显示不全。\n第六次被拒的原因有三个：\n付费页面的按钮文案不符合要求，而我这还是借鉴了 Mobbin 发布的关于提高付费转化率的最佳实践。\n付费后遇到错误，我猜是因为 App 销售范围和订阅的销售范围不一致导致的，因为我还没有时间备案，所以第一版就不打算在国内上架了。虽然 App 销售范围去掉了中国大陆，但是订阅的销售范围还是所有国家和地区，这里不一致，另外我也回复给审核人员说这个 App 不在中国大陆销售，请用其他国家的配置环境来审核。\n技术支持 URL 留的网址不符合要求，我本以为用 Notion 搭一个包含隐私政策和使用协议的简单页面就可以了，但是苹果说必须要是能和开发者直接联系的网站才行。\n第七次提交后就马上是午夜十二点了，心情已经麻木和崩溃了，十分沮丧和忐忑地入睡了。我还梦见了第七次被拒，审核员还给我发了一封巨长巨长的邮件，里面罗列了各种素材和命名的截图，说我的 App 抄袭黑神话·悟空……\n还好，没有第七次被拒，一觉醒来，审核通过了！\n我偏要贪图完满，搜个干净\n黑神话·悟空，二周目，白金达成。\n这游戏白金的达成，不是能力问题，也不是时间问题，而是运气问题。\n花了两天在收集各种概率掉落的物品上，感觉我人品还不错，并没有刷到崩溃就收集全了，不过就凭这一点也应该给这个游戏减 0.1 分。",

          "description": "随着美国大选的白热化，预测市场 Polymarket 被大家熟知，已经吸引了近 10 亿美元进行美国总统选举结果的投注，占据了美国大选投注 85%的市场份额。\nPolymarket 的创始人，今年 26 岁的 Shayne Coplan 让我非常感兴趣：\nShayne Coplan 今年 26 岁，但却拥有了 12 年的加密领域经验：\n他 14 岁时接触到加密货币，和朋友用矿机挖莱特币；\n16 岁时参与了以太坊预售，是当年最年轻的参与者之一\n18 岁进入纽约大学，第二学期就退学。3 年后创办了 Polymarket, 目前已经成长为最大的预测市场，甚至影响美国大选。\n作为一名内容创作者、加密爱好者和父亲，我不禁好奇：\nShayne Coplan 的成长环境是什么样？\nShayne Coplan 的成长过程中被哪些事物所影响，让其 14 岁接触到加密、16 岁参与以太坊预售、22 岁创办 Polymarket?\n有哪些部分是我们培养下一代 / 未来企业家时可以参考的？\n\n于是我搜集了和 Shayne Coplan 相关的所有采访，找到一些蛛丝马迹，形成了一篇 7000 字的文章，欢迎阅读和分享： https://www.web3brand.io/p/polymarket-shayne-coplan\n另外因为是人物故事的形式，这篇文章同样适合收听，于是我同时制作了一份有声版，同样欢迎收听，enjoy： https://www.xiaoyuzhoufm.com/episode/66e521835ca6d0ace3e0fd22",

          "description": "最近在做一个电表的辅助程序开发，遇到了一些困难，求懂的大佬给科普一下。\n我仔细阅读了 DL/T 645-2007 标准，同时又根据上游给了几组合法数据，与设备进行了一些调试，发现目标设备数据格式并不完全和 645 标准一致，初步怀疑可能是采用了上海规约（因为设备产自上海地区），可是网上找不到相关上海规约的具体规范文件。\n以简单的读表操作来说，上游给的正确数据应该是：68XXXXXXXXXXXX681104323733228316，但是根据 645 标准，数据域并不应该是 3237332283 。\n同时设备上的返回值是68XXXXXXXXXXXX689139323733229c843433 fa373333373333336f333b3a3d33e73333333333b73475ac3375ac33333333333333575533333333b468333333333333335116，很显然返回值的数据域也与 645 标准不一致，看起来像是经过了某种 xor 或者数据偏移。而且只有数据域参与了偏移，控制位之前的数据位都是符合 645-2007 标准的。\n很遗憾的上游需求方也是层层转包过来，具体的细节他们也无法给出更多的参考资料，只能给出许多正确的请求样例与返回样例。\n因此，现在我就只关心一点了，这个设备的返回的数据是使用了某种地方性规范还是厂家自己魔改的。各位大佬们有关于上海规约的规范性文件嘛？如果对不上规范文件的标准，那这个活不干就是了。",

          "description": "在前端使用加解密方式容易暴露密钥（或许一定会），但是如果把密钥藏起来，藏到二进制中或许就不容易被发现了。\n\nsm4-sdk\n是我用来验证想法的 demo ，下面介绍大概思路，以及有些踩坑的内容\n一、基本情况\n1 、使用 wasm-pack 这个工具来创建项目，编译成 web 类型\nwasm-pack new sm4-sdk\nwasm-pack build --target web\n\n2 、使用了一个简单的国密库\ncargo add smcrypto\n\n经过一番研究发现它的 Padding 模式是 PKCS5Padding\n3 、使用dotenv达成编译阶段注入变量的目的\n从前端的工程化的一些经验中借鉴来的，dotenv支持从环境变量和.env文件读取变量，\ncargo add dotenv\n\n// file config.rs\nuse dotenv_codegen::dotenv;\n\npub const KEY: &str = dotenv!(\"SM4_SDK_KEY\");\npub const IV: &str = dotenv!(\"SM4_SDK_IV\");\n\n4 、如何使用\n克隆这个项目，将.env.example修改为.env文件，修改里面的密钥内容，执行\nwasm-pack build --target web\n\n二、踩坑\n1 、安装wasm-pack\n安装wasm-pack命令有两种方式，通过cargo或者npm\n如果是 windows 环境，建议设置 default host 等设为msvc\n// file settings.toml\ndefault_host_triple = \"x86_64-pc-windows-msvc\"\ndefault_toolchain = \"stable-x86_64-pc-windows-msvc\"\n\n2 、使用github action自动打包\n希望通过github action的环境变量提供给项目打包时使用，可能dotenv没有支持好，可能是我配置不对。不过不折腾的方式是配置repository secrets，使用时新建一个.env文件\n// file workflows/wasm-pack.yml\n      - name: create env file\n        run: |\n          touch .env\n          echo SM4_SDK_KEY=${{ secrets.SM4_SDK_KEY }} >> .env\n          echo SM4_SDK_IV=${{ secrets.SM4_SDK_IV }} >> .env\n\n三、如何使用\n参考项目中的example.html的做法，这个项目并没有上传到 npm 上，\n<script type=\"module\">\n    import init, { encrypt_to_base64, decrypt_from_base64 } from './pkg/sm4_sdk.js';\n\n    const run = async () => {\n        await init();\n        const origin = \"hello world\";\n        const encoded_str = encrypt_to_base64(origin);\n        console.log(encoded_str); // ${encoded_str}\n        const decoded_str = decrypt_from_base64(encoded_str);\n        console.log(decoded_str === origin);\n        appendResult(encoded_str);\n    }\n\n    run(); // checkout console for result\n</script>",

          "description": "今天下午，一朋友在某群 at 我，神秘兮兮的说道要考我一个问题。题目是这样的：\n在 Java 中有 Father 和 Son 类，其中 Son 继承了 Father 类，两类均有 method 方法，现在 Main 类的 main 方法有如下调用：\nFather f = new Son();\nf.method();\n\n问题是，编译此代码，完成后删除 Son.class，请问代码会报错吗？\n我嗤之以鼻，这还用问吗？我甚至可以告诉你这个代码会报的错一定是 NoClassDefFoundError，这也太简单了你拿这个来考我 balabala...\n然而朋友鬼魅一笑（？），你别急啊，题还没出完呢：\n在上述代码的基础上，加入一个 flag justFalse，并环绕到上述代码中：\n// in Main.java\nstatic boolean justFalse = false;\n\n// in Main#main method\nif (justFalse) {\n\tFather f = new Son();\n\tf.method();\n}\n\n同样编译后删除 Son.class，请问代码还还会报错吗？\n我大笑（？）道，这还用问？justFalse 永远是 false，也就是说内部代码永远不可能执行到，那么 Son 类也就永远不可能进入初始化阶段，所以这个代码肯定就不会报错了，这也太简单了你拿这个来考我 balabala...\n然后朋友发来的一张图让我沉默了：\n\n竟然真的会报错，难道 JVM 虚拟机会提前解析并未执行的代码行中包含的类引用吗？不对啊，这和我以前的实践完全不一样，怎么会这样...... 就在我陷入自我怀疑的时候，下一题来了：\n在上述代码的基础上，如果把 Father f = new Son(); 修改为 Son f = new Son();，在同样的操作下，请问代码还还会报错吗？\n我小心翼翼地问道：不会这样它就不会报错了吧...\n朋友淡淡说道：正是。\n我的脑海中此时一万匹草泥马奔驰而过，各种名词在我的大脑中穿过：类加载、静态分派、运行时多态、分支预测... 但没有一个能解释这个诡异的现象。\n我的天塌了。 \n深入了解 JVM 类加载机制\n当说到 JVM 的类加载机制，很多人可能会脱口而出：加载、验证、准备、解析、初始化。如果你接着问他，他可能还会告诉你，解析这个阶段在某些情况下可以在初始化阶段之后开始，这被 JVM 虚拟机称为“惰性解析（\"lazy\" or \"late\" resolution ）”。那么，出现上述情况的原因可能是因为惰性解析被提前了吗？\n然而答案是否定的，在任何情况下，对于一个类，无论其静态分派的类型是什么，其解析都会延迟进行。（即使在 JVM specs 中这种行为是未定义的，虚拟机实现可以选择立刻解析或是延迟解析）\n那么问题出在哪里了呢？经过一番查证，我发现这个报错其实是在 JVM 类加载的验证阶段产生的。\n注意，这里说的不是验证 Son.class 或是 Father.class，而是 Main.class。如果你仔细观察上面给出的堆栈轨迹（在 Oracle JDK 1.8, Hotspot VM 下），其中有一段就是 sun.launcher.LauncherHelper.checkAndLoadMain(LauncherHelper.java:632)。\n在类加载阶段，JVM 虚拟机会试图校验一个类的某些部分是否是未被破坏以及符合预期的。在对 Main.class 类的加载过程中，对于 Father f = new Son(); 和 f.method();，产生了一个包含向上类型转换的多态函数调用，对于这种调用，JVM 虚拟机会试图进行校验，这就需要加载 Son.class 的类结构，而 Son.class 已经被我们删除了，所以产生了报错。\n这种检查需要同时包含 typecast 以及多态函数调用，在上述代码中，无论将变量类型修改为变量的实际类型 Son，亦或者删去对 method 方法的调用，那么也不会产生报错。\n最后，如何验证上述推断是正确的呢？很简单，使用 -noverify 参数关闭 JVM 的类加载校验，你就可以发现上述代码正常运行了。\n（上述代码在 Java 1.8 和 Java 21 的 Hotspot 虚拟机上均能复现。为方便行文，对部分内容有所改编。）",

          "description": "依稀记得在 gpt 渐入大众的视野时，和朋友闲聊一个话题----gpt 和人类最大的区别是什么？有位朋友提到了创造性，gpt 虽然可以在短时间内快速给出接近人类思维的答复，但是给出的方案是待考究且可能是过时的。在同等情况下，人类不仅会基于专业基础还会根据其他学识综合当前处境调整应对策略，给出意想不到的解决方案。而 gpt 只能根据预训练模型中被“喂养”的知识给出一堆耦合成的弱连贯性回复，这一点在提问范围模糊时更有体现。\n  \n  但随着更多高级模型推出及用户使用次数提升，我们对 AI 工具(比如 Open AI,Kimi,Claude)的使用愈发上手，知道如何调整提问让它给出更精确的答案----我们只需要耐心把细节告诉 AI ，剩下的只需要等待、审视、根据上一轮答复微调提问。此刻我们不再是一个 Task Runner,而转变成了 Project Owner 。在 AI 降世之前，开发者们可能会因为写出一个复杂、抽象函数代码而沾沾自喜、自我陶醉在技术实现的世界里。而实现只是服务于功能运行，把关注点转移到架构设计、功能实用性，远比实现本身有更大的价值体现。受益的不仅是团队，更是产品及用户。\n  \n  AI 成为了我们的左膀右臂，意味着不必再为了数个类似业务重复劳作。既然如此，跳出劳动者这个定位，尝试从责任人的角度看待事物，那能做的事情就不只是实现层面。而是关乎整个项目起草，mvp 版本，需求迭代。这个过程则是产品间（或者独立开发）与自身、用户（甲方）商讨，及内部讨论大胆描述天马行空的想法，脑海里不断模拟、创造出期望的画面、思索细节，直到敲定了某一条分支，然后召集职能人员对齐理解，并着手开发。过程中的讨论、描述都是创造、设计的艺术体现，这使得我们对项目的理解层次得到升华。\n  \n  最后，AI 工具的面向群体愈发广泛，多数行业在熟练运用后都可以减少开发时的成本。请尝试着成为 AI 工具的 leader ，具体实现交给他们就行，然后全身心投入在需求分析、方案评审、可行性评估上，思路正确远比着手干来得重要且有意思。Project Owner 何尝不是产品经理，既然是产品, 则关乎设计，而设计便是艺术。\n推荐阅读\n● 「代码艺术家」不会被 AI 取代 ( https://lutaonan.com/blog/code-artist/)\n● Software is Art ( https://danielnguyen.me/software-is-art-2)",

          "description": "事情起因是这样的。前天的一个帖子里（ https://www.v2ex.com/t/1070885?p=1#reply35 ）大家都表示 AI 对自己的工作无用。我只是有点好奇，为什么我的感觉完全相反？所以想分享一下我的感觉和情况，很好奇大家感觉的没用是什么意义上的没有用（因为不了解专业程序员的工作流程）。\n本人没学过大多数码，但是算法懂。因为工作和研究兴趣需要（ NLP ，很多很冷门的语言），也会经常坐一些很没办法要做的东西。比如分词器，就和 Andrej Karpathy 的网课跟着做，所以其实前一段时间看见他推荐 cursor ，我前天开始也就试着用。然后就觉得 AI 太有用了。我暂时感觉突然摆脱了对程序员的大多数依赖。\n比如，试验阶段就很快用 prompts 做了一个全栈的、机构内部使用的工作记录论坛，感觉很兴奋。因为我之前既不会 java 、也没学过 sql 。就看着看着，debug 的时候，感觉就大概了解了构架、前端后端怎么互动的 blabla ，觉得很不错。我打算马上用现有的经验，写一个网页版的数据库，可以搜集结构化的语料 metadata （就是研究生会看古代语言的、就用这个网页进行标记并且生成结构化的元数据的 database 了，以后 training 时候用）（这样他们做习题就是 labelling slaves 了哈哈）。在之前这是想都不敢想的，肯定会想外包。但即便让专业 coder 做，也会有太多太多需要交流的小细节，比如很多语言是从右到左、从上到下，元音啊各种细节包不包括，乱七八糟的细节，这些调整交流起来会吐血（尤其是 coder 如果完全是技术部门来的），和 cursor 交流就感觉非常好，真的可以一个人把这个想了很久的事情做成。\n再举一个例子，我之前也想过用 OpenAI 的 api 去导出一些专业的语料元数据，但是有一定的格式需求。我大概知道 function calling 和新的 Response format 可以实现，但是因为自己不是专业的，手笨不会做。但程序员一般都只会英语或者欧洲语言，对这些元语料的结构理解需要很多解释（因为现代语言一般语法都很简单），这是去年就一直搁置到现在。昨天突然想起来，半个小时之内就开始用 function calling 自动帮我生成 training data 了。今天打算晚点试试 response format 效果会不会更好。\n所以我会感觉 ai 真厉害，尤其是很多事情可以一个人做了，会比团队快很多。可能有人觉得 AI 不会 debug ，其实不是这样的。第一，这几天 cursor+claudedev 几乎可以解决过程中 60%的错误。即便不能解决，很快要求它们解释哪部分代码是负责的，看懂之后很容易也能修好剩下的问题。（可能对程序员来说，没学过 java 看 java 的代码是荒谬的。但是实际情况是，其实 java 和 python 里也充满了自然语言，大多数问题理解了出在哪里就很容易看见并且修改。一些更高级的概念，比如类的继承啥的，单独看半个小时也基本理解了，虽然具体语句记不住但是可以问 ai 写。更复杂的 transformer 啥的框架确实要另外学懂才会改造，这个 ai 不行。还有， 剩下 40%的几率 ai 即便不能完全 debug 、但可以快速定位是哪些代码，定位速度可能比有经验的眼睛还快）\n是不是专业程序员写的程序都比这些任务要复杂很多，所以 ai 会失效？还是什么别的原因会觉得 ai 鸡肋呢？真心好奇，避争论。",

          "description": "我近期遭受的不公平不是简单的欠薪，提交一个劳动仲裁就行了，问题比较复杂。。。\n前言\n两个月之前我找到了一份 Java 开发的工作，跟我签合同的是位于外省的 B 公司，外派到上海某个甲方工作。我十年经验，但是当时 B 公司说只能给 14k ，并且试用期必须打八折，我说试用期不打折另外涨一点行不行，B 公司 HR 米雅说不打八折那只能签劳务而非劳动合同，但是如果你不要社保，这部分成本可以给到你加到工资里。我果断答应，失业了一段时间了，先把钱拿到手，社保以后再说。\n用人结构\n入职之后才发现，虽然在甲方大楼办公，但直接管理我的并不是甲方的人，甲方把一整个项目以项目制的形式给 A 公司，A 公司的项目经理直接负责整个项目，项目组除了我是通过人力公司 B 公司找过来的，其他都是 A 公司的人，我的用人结构就是甲方 - A - B - 我，工资要被剥削两层，这也解释了我为什么工资那么低，虽然甲方并没有为了我这个十年经验少付成本。\n很显然这个工作是很坑的，钱少不说，风险还大，这个跟工程行业的层层转包一样，一整个支付链一个环节出了问题，作为末端的你就拿不到钱。\n在甲方不知情的情况下，我被 A 公司项目经理单方面退场\nA 公司项目经理给了我一个比较复杂的任务，第一个任务没做好害得测试和 A 公司经理陪我加了周六一天班这是我不对，但最后也顺利交付了，甲方的测试报告也显示这个版本我做的功能都没问题。\n但是这事之后 A 公司经理没有直接跟我接触，辗转找到了 B 公司米雅，告知要退人，并且人员外包费只能结算一半。B 公司米雅告诉我，A 公司经理只给她们结算一半外包费的话，B 公司也只能给我一半工资。劝退我这个事情，完全是 A 公司经理个人意愿，甲方不知情。甚至也没找我谈话。\n跟 A 公司项目经理谈话争取到延期一个月\n当天我找 B 经理谈话，刚开始还笑嘻嘻，我摊牌之后才变脸。他说了我一堆问题，从工作能力…",

          "description": "这是一个困扰我很久的，关于读书的问题，我几年前在别的地方问过，但是没有得到正经的回答，今天看到有人在这里发帖问哪里读书合适，随又想起这个问题。\n首先说明我的状况，我其实很少“读书”。除了上学时候的课本，以及工作需要相关的技术书，别的书基本没有完整读过一本。\n至于原因，我觉得工作中用到的技术书读的也差不多了，其他的技能知识类书用不到。\n那种“闲书”比不上看个电影\n我内心中是把书有分类的。\n大概就是“闲书”和正统的书。（其实不知道如何描述）\n闲书呢。在我看来就是讲一故事。\n以前上高中的时候，我有很多同学喜欢读那种小说，就是武侠、玄幻、修仙等等之类的。\n还有那些传记类的书，比如乔布斯传等等\n\n正规书，比如《算法导论》《母猪的养殖技术》之类的。\n大体可以理解为学知识和听故事的区别。\n以前上学特别不喜欢做阅读理解，让你分析作者这么写得意义是啥，还要给你个固定答案。\n鬼知道作者是不是那个意思，不是说一千个人有一千个哈姆雷特么？\n如果读书类型都是类似上面的听故事类型，那是不是跟追动漫，看电影，看综艺差不多娱乐成本居多？还是说也能从中汲取“养分”。\n\n越说越觉得我自己拧巴，但是具体拧巴的点又描述不太清楚。\n可能从小就把“读书人”这个几个字，跟知识渊博划等号。觉得读书是高雅的事。\n从各个方面获取的信息来看，只要你读书就会被鼓励，无论你读啥。\n郭德纲之前说过，不要总想着相声有什么教育意义，大家一笑一乐那就可以了。\n不是硬要讨论读书还要分个高低贵贱、三六九等啥的，只是我觉得过去知识(技能)为目的的读书才叫读书。",

          "description": "房子卖掉了，亏了小几万，可以接受，就当买个教训。\n以后都不敢把希望寄托在邻居的素质上了。当然还有新房的质量上了。\n把从买到卖，盘点一下，才发现一路走来，真的一步一坑。\n一 买房\n当时还是限购， 需要摇号。\n我家就一个人有资格，\n摇中后， 两个选择：\n1 付定金 2w 。  2 放弃购买，半年内无资格参与摇号\n当时只有样板间，也没什么好参考的，\n所以除非有特别原因 等同于只能选 1 。\n然后约付首付，又是两个选择\n1 付首付。2 放弃 损失定金。\n所以等同于还是只有一个选择。\n我印象里付完首付，才签的合同，记不太清了。\n当时宣传的是房子当年年底就可以交房，我们也是被这个吸引的。\n实际签合同时，在未有任何通知的情况下，合同上的交房时间比宣传的延期了 7 个月。\n这时候同样两个选择，1 签合同，2 扯皮，大概率亏钱。\n毕竟定金，首付都交了，贼船已经上了。\n所以实际上，等同于还是只有一个选择。\n然后交房时间比合同上的还要延期，实际晚了一年半。\n哦 对了 当时还新实行了一个政策，大意就是不卖毛坯了，卖精装修，合同上装修价格是每平米两千多。\n也是没法反对的。\n还能咋样呢，继续签字呗。\n二 收房\n当时花了两百多，请了个验房师。\n人家倒也算敬业，大大小小便利贴，贴了一屋子。\n什么空鼓，裂缝，锁装反了，比比皆是。\n最搞笑的是，燃气热水器孤零零的挂在那，居然接不到燃气管。\n然后呢 报备到开发商，\n偶尔才有下文。\n有些改了，大部分不了了之。\n同样，业主一点办法都没有。\n看似有选择，实则无选择。\n不收房，房子也是你的，问题也还是存在的，我有邻居三年没收房，里面的门还是没装的。\n只能先住着吧。\n三 住房\n三个字，质量差。\n今天这里坏，明天那里坏。\n电梯不到一年，就频繁的关人，或者维修。\n洗脸池，睡前还好好的，起床发现洗脸池掉地上了。\n有个业主很委屈的在群里说，“你们啥时候来给我修灯啊，我都摸黑半年了”。\n最大的槽点是隔音，极其的差。\n楼上，楼上的楼上，楼下的走路说话唱歌，我都可以听到。\n我的房子里就像恐怖片一样，明明就我一个人，能听到一大家子的声音，\n身临其境。\n有走路的，有放东西的，有大喊的，有跑步的，有关门的，\n此起彼伏，热闹非凡。\n偏偏我楼上素质极差，十岁大的小孩，三年学不会穿拖鞋，大人放任不管。大人七点吵架，摔东西。\n沟通过，讲道理过，吵架过，反击过，甚至想过同归于尽，\n不胜其烦。\n当时还是限售，想卖都卖不掉，我是生生的被折磨了几年。\n最后限售过了，很多原因叠加，决定卖了。\n四 卖房\n现在卖房的情况是，不管你装修，不管你户型，不管你楼层，不管你的任何附加价值，只看小区的近期成交价。\n这肯定是不合理的，\n因为就算你去买猪肉，还得分前腿和五花，不同部位的价格肯定不同。\n所以个人感觉这种情况不会持续太久。\n中介，很不专业，房屋信息都能讲错，只会不停的劝你降价。\n（我的房子挂的价格是很公道的，贝壳评分也很高，并没有挂高价）\n甚至出现过疑似虚假带看的行为。\n有一个很假的客户，他走后我就知道，第二天中介肯定要来报价，果然报价了。\n签约，合同是统一的模板，但感觉对卖方的保障不够到位，\n比如如果因为买家问题，导致贷款批不下来，最后终止合同，默认选项是定金返还。\n这就不合理，要不然要定金干嘛呢。\n如果有卖房的朋友，可以关注下这里。\n卖房流程还有一个坑点，首先每个地方的流程和政策是不一样的，可能我说的，其他地方是不存在的。\n买家拿到新房产证后，需要去抵押，然后银行放款。\n这里的坑点就是，如果买家不去抵押，选择了取消贷款，房子已经过户了，你尾款收不到。\n我不知道其他的地方是怎么保障这一块的。\n我去问过银行，他们说，买家是可以取消贷款的，银行不能阻止，也不会通知卖家。\n我也网上查过，有地方是发生过这种 zha 骗的。\n如果买家确实要买，那就没问题，如果别有用心，就很难说。\n所以我当时还是焦虑了两天，还好收到钱了。\n综上，这就是我从买到卖的经历。\n如果踩几个坑，那也许是我运气不好。\n如果每一步都踩了坑，我想不会全是因为我衰。\n反正经历了这一切，我是不太想买房子了，至少不买新房。\n唉 其实房子卖了，还是有点舍不得的，折磨了我这么久，但我也投入了这么多精力和感情。\n现在无车无房无债，有存款。\n希望开始新的生活。",

          "description": "最近在开发一个支持 Markdown 的博客模板，我希望我的博客模板能够兼容大多数博客模板会支持的功能，比如 TOC 、脚注、代码块等，还需要确保博客模板能够适应一些比较偏门的情况（比如冷门 emoji 、超大图片、内容过短、超大表格等），确保在这些冷门情况下博客表现符合预期。所以需要一些 Markdown 文章做测试。除了做测试，这些文章还可以放到博客模板展示中，以展示博客模板的功能。然而发现适合用来做测试和展示功能的 Markdown 文章不好找，要么有版权问题，要么无法充分展示模板的功能。\n所以我用 ChatGPT 生成了 20 篇 Markdown 文章，尽量确保这些文章用到足够多的特性以及包含可能的特殊情况。本仓库已置入公共领域，可以随意使用。\n目前本仓库还有很多可以改进的地方，以后也会不断完善。\n链接： https://github.com/hanyujie2002/markdown-placeholder",

          "description": "2024 ，0826-0901\n暑假结束了，天气凉快了，孩子终于要开学了。\n8 月数据总结\n最近一个多月都在全身心在新 App 上，所有的在架 App 都没有任何打理。\n总得来看，下载量提升很多，App Store 和 Google Play 的收入没什么变化，但是国内安卓市场的收入大幅减少。\n下载量（极简时钟）\nApp Store ，增长 44%\nGoogle Play ，增长 19.30%\n国内安卓市场，因为上个月的数据不全，就和 6 月份对比，增长了 18.7%\n收入变化\nApp Store ，增长 2.2%\nGoogle Play ，增长 9.08%\nAdmob ，增长 0.28%\n国内安卓市场，减少 18.92%\nShip-A-Ton 第三周\nShip-A-Ton 就剩 18 天了，感觉要砍掉一个大功能才能勉强提交了。\n这周严重阻碍开发进度的就是黑神话·悟空！。每天都会玩到后半夜一点多，这就导致睡眠不足，严重影响到了白天的开发效率。\n这周的番茄钟数量是 26 ，相比上周多了 4 个， 但也只是 4 个而已。开发速度太慢了，这让我又开始焦虑了。\n\n这周有两个主要的进展，一是完成了第三个功能模块的原型，跑通了整个流程。这个模块经历了两次更名，一开始叫 Wishlist ，再后来叫 Goals ，最后定为 Desires 。\n另一个进展就是和设计师顺利达成了合作，App 的 UI 终于有保证了。这一周的绝大部分开发时间都花在了 UI 上，和我之前自己瞎写的 UI 一对比，简直是云泥之别。专业的事情还是要交给专业的人来做。\n[Vlog: Week 3 for Shipaton]\n本周探索\n监测 ScrollView 滚动状态\n需要在新 App 里加入对 ScrollView 滚动状态的监测，看完了肘子哥的文章，# 如何判断 ScrollView 、List 是否正在滚动中。因为 App 是 iOS 17+ 的，还不能直接使用 iOS 18 的新 API ， 直接就使用了肘子哥的 IsScrolling 。\n单复数的文案本地化\nApp 里需要用的针对单词单复数的不同文案，所以就第一次使用了 SwiftUI 中 Text 对单复数的 API ，不用自己写 if else 判断，很优雅。# Pluralisation made simpler in SwiftUI\nSVG 转成 SF Symbols\n我想要把 MasterGo/Figma 里面的切图导出后，放到 Xcode 中，然后通过 Image 和 foregroundStyle 给切图加上不同的颜色，就像 SF Symbols 那样。导出成 jpg 和 png 都无法做到，尝试导出 SVG 后才发现 SwiftUI 的 Image 还不支持 SVG 。\n我就想着怎么能把 SVG 转成 SF Symbols ，找了两个工具 App ，都是收费的，连试用也没有，我就没敢直接付费。于是我就问了下 ChatGPT 怎么将 SVG 转换成 SF Symbols ，AI 的回答如下：\n\n我就在这个回答里找到了解决方案：PDF ！将 icon 导出为 PDF ，放到 Xcode 的 Asset 里，然后将图片设置为 Render as Template Image 就可以了。\n生活\n吃了两顿大餐，还发现了一家不错的面馆。\n和许久没见的老同学见面，畅聊一晚。\n\n直面天命，刚过第五回，下周肯定能通关了。\n第三回，黄眉差一点初见过，我以为还有一个阶段变身，当时葫芦也没酒了，就摆烂打了。\n第四回，晦月魔君确实恶心，我是天命人，不是修脚师傅！\n第五回，死的最多次数居然是在铁球山路……\n\n最近因为玩游戏和写代码，尤克里里都生疏了，每天练习时间大大减少，甚至有一两天都没拿起来。花了将近一个月练习 Em 和弦终于成功了，录了 New Boy 。\n[Vlog: Ukulele - New Boy]\n视频内容还请移步到公众号文章里查看： https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/OgBlZGfDmPtq7hFY7XLi9g",

App Store搜索不到《炉石传说》\n\r\n\r\n由于在过去一年中游戏下架，在App Store中搜索“炉石传说”关键词的点击都被引入了其他应用，导致根据算法《炉石传说》在昨日不在搜索结果前排。目前随着正常点击的覆盖与相关优化的执行，您已经可以正常搜索到游戏了。\n\r\n\r\n3. 主播可以正常进入\n\r\n\r\n我们并未识别这些玩家，同时暴雪游戏也没有插队等特权功能。请您理性看待这些言论。\n\r\n\r\n4. 某某模式没有人玩了，所以匹配时间过长。\n\r\n\r\n请玩家们理解，目前匹配时间过长是由于BUG导致的，无法反应正常的游戏情况。\n\r\n\r\n最后，我们对目前的糟糕体验再次致歉，期望在服务器稳定后再给我们一次机会与您在酒馆中愉快游戏。",

          "description": "《异形》是一系列科幻恐怖电影。首集《异形》（Alien，1979年）由雷德利·斯科特执导，之后又推出了三部续集《异形2》（Aliens，1986年）、《异形3》（Alien 3，1992年）、《异形4》（Alien: Resurrection，1997年）以及一部独立间传《异形：夺命舰》（Alien: Romulus，2024年）；雷德利·斯科特还执导了异形的前传系列《普罗米修斯》（Prometheus，2012年）和《异形：契约》（Alien: Covenant，2017年）。\n\r\n\r\n异形1\n\r\n\r\n2122年，商业太空船“诺斯特罗莫号”在航行途中收到了一组不明信号，飞船前往信号源地进行搜救，船员们在神秘星球的调查过程中，意外释放了一种致命的外星生物“异形”，“诺斯特罗莫号”的船员们不得不与异形展开了一场惊心动魄的战斗。\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n异形2\n\r\n\r\n延续了前作的恐怖氛围，讲述了女主角在57年后（2179年）被救回地球后，与一支海军陆战队一起返回被异形入侵的殖民星球，与异形进行殊死搏斗的故事。\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n异形3\n\r\n\r\n剧情紧接着第二部，2179年，女主角逃亡的飞船出现意外，坠落在一个阴冷黑暗的星球上，这个星球是一个关押犯人的太空监狱，只有一群被遗弃的囚犯和看守，异形也侵入了这个星球，由于这个星球上没有现代武器和科技，女主角和囚犯们只能依靠原始的工具来对抗异形。\n\r\n\r\n更糟糕的是，女主角发现，在她体内还有一只雌性异形正在成长，最后，女主角和已经破体而出的异形一起投入了高温熔炉同归于尽。\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n异形4\n\r\n\r\n2379年，女主角死亡后200年，在一艘名叫“贝蒂”的太空船上，科学家们通过克隆技术复活了女主角，并从她体内取出了异形女王的胚胎。\n\r\n\r\n科学家们希望利用异形进行研究，但事情很快失控，异形逃脱并开始猎杀船员，女主角和一群雇佣兵联手对抗这个致命的恐怖生物。\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n普罗米修斯\n\r\n\r\n《异形》的前传，故事发生在2089年，考古学家伊丽莎白·肖和同事在苏格兰的斯凯岛找到了一份星图，在韦兰公司的赞助下组建一支探险队，搭乘“普罗米修斯号”飞船出发前往星图所指引的行星LV-223，查找制造人类的“工程师”外星人，试图揭开人类起源的谜团。\n\r\n\r\n飞船飞行过程中船员都处于休眠状态，由人形机器人大卫监控旅程，飞船于2093年到达目的地，结果发现外星人制造了一种黑色液体的生物武器想要毁灭地球上的人类，女考古学家带领普罗米修斯号撞击外星飞船以阻止外星人的企图，而外星人最终被巨型抱脸虫杀死，并生下了第一个异形。\n\r\n\r\n2094年，女考古学家和机器人大卫一同开着外星飞船前往外星人的母星，了解为什么他们要毁灭人类。\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n异形：契约\n\r\n\r\n《普罗米修斯》的续集，2094年，女考古学家和机器人大卫在前往外星人母星的途中，由于拥有自主意识的大卫改变想法，害死了女考古学家，并将黑色病原体遍布外星人母星，致使他们种族灭绝，大卫则留在该星球进行研发异形的实验，成功用黑色病原体创造出各种异形生物。\n\r\n\r\n2104年，“契约号”殖民太空船载有15名船员和2000名殖民者前往欧瑞伽六号星球，因收到不明消息，船员们决定改变航线，前往信号发出的星球进行探索。\n\r\n\r\n在那里，他们遇到了《普罗米修斯》中的机器人大卫，并遭到异形的感染和袭击，在契约号船员对抗异形的过程中，机器人大卫蒙骗了他们，并混入契约号，带着异形胚胎，独自驾驶着契约号飞往目的地。\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n异形：夺命舰\n\r\n\r\n《异形系列》的第七部电影作品，故事发生在《异形1》剧情后的20年，2142年，一艘韦兰德太空探测器调查了二十年前被摧毁的诺斯特罗莫号的残骸，科学家打开了陨石，里面有一只异形。\n\r\n\r\n几个月后，一群年轻的太空殖民者，为了逃离殖民地，前往探索一艘废弃的公司太空船时，意外遭遇了宇宙中最恐怖的生命体：“异形”。",
