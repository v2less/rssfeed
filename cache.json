          "description": "10 years ago I began working on Muki, a web-based MIDI and chiptune player which I eventually announced here on HN[0]. It was a fun weekend project.\nOver the years I received numerous requests from people that wanted more: more music, more features, more playable formats, you name it.\nEventually I began working on a complete rewrite of the app (this time for real), and, realizing that each year another chiptune or MIDI website went offline, I decided to start archiving them for preservation.\nToday, 10 years after the first release, I think it's finally time for the new, nicer version to hit the shelves. It's now called Pixeltune and yes, now you can actually turn down the volume. :)\nHope you like it!\n[0] https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=10305918\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41218811\nPoints: 13\n# Comments: 1",

They are in a top ranked EECS program, think (Stanford, Berkeley, MIT, Cornell, CMU...) and the grades are not great.\nThey are not focused on internship, which is about to end, and I don't think they did a good job. I tried to help but they're just not prioritizing the work. When at home they are just spending time on the above game. It's hard for us to decide how much to push and how much to let go, in case it all backfires and makes it worse. I'm worried they are throwing this great educational opportunity away which will impact their entire future life and worse this develops into something even more serious that it already is.\nHas anyone else gone through this, personally or for a loved one, and has any suggestions?\nThank you!!\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41212099\nPoints: 41\n# Comments: 61",

          "description": "Almost exactly 1 year ago, I submitted something to HN about using Llama2 (which had just come out) to improve the output of Tesseract OCR by correcting obvious OCR errors [0]. That was exciting at the time because OpenAI's API calls were still quite expensive for GPT4, and the cost of running it on a book-length PDF would just be prohibitive. In contrast, you could run Llama2 locally on a machine with just a CPU, and it would be extremely slow, but \"free\" if you had a spare machine lying around.\nWell, it's amazing how things have changed since then. Not only have models gotten a lot better, but the latest \"low tier\" offerings from OpenAI (GPT4o-mini) and Anthropic (Claude3-Haiku) are incredibly cheap and incredibly fast. So cheap and fast, in fact, that you can now break the document up i…",

          "description": "Hello HN!\nThe day has finally come to stop adding features and start sharing what I've been building the last 5-6 months.\nIt's a bit of CrewAI, OpenDevon, LangFuse/Cloud all in one, providing devs who prefer TypeScript an integrated framework thats provides a lot out of the box to start experimenting and building agents with.\nIt started after peeking at the LangChain docs a few times and never liking the example code. I began experimenting with automating a simple Jira request from the engineering team to add an index to one of our Google Spanner databases (for context I'm the DevOps/SRE lead for an AdTech company).\nIt incudes the tooling we're building out to automate processes from a DevOps/SRE perspective, which initially includes a configurable GitLab merge request AI reviewer.\nThe initial layer above Aider (https://aider.chat/) grew into coding agent and an autonomous agent with LLM-independent function calling with auto-generated function schemas.\nAnd as testing via the CLI became unwieldy soon grew database persistence, tracing, a Web UI and human-in-the-loop functionality.\nOne of the more interesting additions is the new autonomous agent which generates Python code that can call the available functions.\nUsing the pyodide library the tool objects are proxied into the Python scope and executed in a WebAssembly sandbox.\nAs its able to perform multiple calls and validation logic in a single control loop, it can reduce the cost and latency, getting the most out of the frontier LLMs calls with better reasoning.\nBenchmark runners for the autonomous agent and coding benchmarks are in the works to get some numbers on the capabilities so far. I'm looking forward to getting back to implementing all the ideas around improving the code and autonomous agents from a metacognitive perspective after spending time on docs, refactorings and tidying up recently.\nCheck it out at https://github.com/trafficguard/nous\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41202064\nPoints: 69\n# Comments: 21",

          "description": "Hi HN! I'm Jamil Bou Kheir, founder of Firezone (https://www.firezone.dev), a remote access platform that is a replacement for legacy corporate VPNs. Built on WireGuard (a fast, modern VPN protocol), Firezone secures your team’s apps, networks and services using access policies synced with your identity provider. You deploy tiny, self-contained binaries into your infrastructure anywhere you need access, and your workforce uses our client apps to reach the resources they protect.\nHere’s a demo: https://youtu.be/QEv7dJwKMvo.\nHistorically, the tool used to achieve this has been the corporate VPN. These work off a security model where you authenticate with the perimeter and gain access to the network behind it, which works when most workers are in office and resources on-prem.

          "description": "I wanted to show you something I was hacking on for the last few weeks.\nI tired of sharing screen via Google Meet with 1-hour limitation, with Zoom and 40-minute limitation, etc. With paid Slack subscription. And often times I just needed to screenshare with no audio.\nSo I ended up with my own solution - no registration, low memory, low CPU, low tek 1 fps encrypted screen sharing. Currently sharing only the main screen (good for laptop users).\nIt's very raw in terms of infrastructure, since I'm not counting bytes (yikes!), everything works on my own dedicated server. But the service itself has been tested, we've been sharing screens for countless hours. All sessions last for 48 hours, then it gets removed with all remaining info.\nEvery new frame replaces the other, and everything is end-to-end encrypted so even server owners and operators won't be able to see what are you sharing.\nThere is also no tracking, except the main page - and I use my own analytics. Sessions are not getting tracked and never will be, and observability currently is not in place.\nAgain, this is a true one-person side hacking project I hope (but I have serious doubts) I might need to scale if it's getting traction to support more users.\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41173161\nPoints: 169\n# Comments: 57",

However, these kinds of pathfinding algorithms really need complex terrain/mazes with interesting obstructions to showcase what they can do and how they work. So, I started thinking about how I could generate cool and diverse random \"mazes\" (they aren't really mazes, but I'm not sure what the best term is). I got a bit carried away thinking of lots of different cool ways to generate these mazes, such as cellular automata, fractals, Fourier transforms, etc.\nThen it turned out that many of the generated mazes weren't actually solvable, so I spent some time coming up with various strategies to test and vali…",

          "description": "Hi Fellow Hackers!\nI'm happy to share with you KittyCal, an installable calendar web app I made over the past two months. Existing calendar apps often focus on scheduling and require many steps to create one event. KittyCal, on the other hand, removes hourly scheduling and keeps everything on one screen.\nHow does it work? Just enter your email address, and we will send you a pair of calendar links (blue and red). There is no login process, click the magic link or scan the QR code to access your calendar. You can then add the page to home screen and use it like a native app.\nLast year, I built a bare bones version of KittyCal for my partner and myself because we wanted a private calendar that launches instantly for casual note-taking. It's worked well for us since, and I'm hoping this multi-tenant version can benefit more people with similar needs.\nPlease try it out and let me know what you think!\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41153712\nPoints: 33\n# Comments: 15",

          "description": "Hi HN!\nI've created a CLI tool called \"ell\" that allows you to interact with LLMs directly from your terminal. Designed with the Unix philosophy in mind, ell is simple, modular, and extensible. You can easily pipe input and output to integrate with other tools. Its templates and hook-based plugins enable you to customize and extend its functionality to suit any needs. Check out the README for usage instructions and examples.\nI developed this tool because existing solutions often felt too heavy, with many dependencies, or they weren't friendly to piping and customization. I, on the contrary, wrote in almost pure Bash with least dependencies. Additionally, I found a lack of tools that could read past terminal output as context. Imagine encountering an issue in your terminal and being able to directly ask an LLM for help with a simple command—this is now possible with ell (see the demo video).\nKnown limitations:\n- To maintain simplicity and efficiency, jq is used for JSON parsing.\n- Cannot avoid curl to sending HTTPS requests. If only there were SSL / TLS support in `/dev/tcp/`!\n- Perl is used to handle terminal escape sequences because regex in Bash does not support looking around.\n- Markdown syntax highlighting is not perfect due to the need for streaming output. It relies on a simple state machine instead of a full parser, which may produce falsy results.\n- Other known issues are listed in Github Issues. Please help add more!\nI welcome any criticism and suggestions, whether it's about the idea or code!\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41138085\nPoints: 141\n# Comments: 47",

          "description": "Hi HN! We're a small team in Lille (France) who make synthesizers and MIDI controllers. We've just released a virtual plugin version of our hardware synth Anyma Phi, which offers a semi-modular environment with a focus on physical models, although there are several other kinds of synthesis.\nHere's a video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6efDQ9GmRpg\nWe're not pivoting to VSTs, it's just that it was a practical way of investigating several issues and helping us with the ongoing development of our upcoming Kickstarter-backed synth (Anyma Omega) and MPE controller (Loom), and a gift to thank our backers for the wait they gave to go through due to several manufacturing and production issues.\nI enjoy reading music-related entries here, so I thought I'd contribute this time and I hope it will interest some. I'm here for any question or remark.\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41132104\nPoints: 30\n# Comments: 9",

See our demo here (https://youtu.be/jiJdfrWurvk). You can talk to Martin through voice in our iOS app. You can also text it via SMS, WhatsApp, or email. Currently, Martin can manage your calendar, set reminders, find information, send you daily briefings, and have text conversations with your contacts on your behalf (from its own phone number).\nI’ve been a Siri power user for a long time, mainly because I’ve always liked using voice as an interface. But, legacy voice assistants like Siri, Google Assistant, and Alexa were never well integrated enough or reliable enough to actually save time.

          "description": "Hey HN,\nTL;DR: We’ve launched a free version of our Shadow IT scanner to identify which SaaS apps are used in your company, who uses them, and if they have high-risk OAuth scopes.\nPhilip and I went through YC with AccessOwl in 2022. We started the company because, in our previous roles, we struggled to track all the SaaS apps, users, and granted OAuth scopes.\nThe Shadow IT scanner started as a small feature within AccessOwl, which manages SaaS vendors and user accounts centrally. But a standalone scanner would have made our lives so much easier in our previous roles. So, we thought, why not release it?\nAnd here it is: a free, standalone Shadow IT scanner!\nHope you find it useful :) The Shadow IT scan helps with:\n1. Offboarding: Employees often don’t report all the apps they sign up for, making it tough to track and secure these accounts when they leave, especially with the common SSO tax.\n2. Security: OAuth scopes are quickly granted but rarely reviewed or removed, leading to organizations unknowingly spreading their data.\n3. Compliance: Auditors need a list of SaaS vendors, which is hard to compile when employees sign up for tools independently.\nAny surprises in your scan? What features would you like to see in the next version?\nLooking forward to your feedback!\nFAQ\nWhat’s Shadow IT?\nUnauthorized SaaS apps within an organization not centrally managed, posing security and compliance risks.\nHow does it work?\nOur tool connects to your Google Workspace or M365 instance, identifies OAuth tokens granted, and maps them to known SaaS tools. Note: In this v1 version, it only detects apps using the “Sign in with Google/Microsoft” button.\nWho is this for?\nTypically IT and InfoSec teams, but in smaller companies, it may fall under the CTO.\nIs it safe to use?\nYes, reading OAuth tokens is standard for SaaS management tools. Data extraction only occurs when you initiate a scan. AccessOwl is SOC 2 Type II audited and GDPR compliant.\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41118468\nPoints: 17\n# Comments: 2",

          "description": "Hey everyone, I'm Ulysse, CTO at SSOReady (https://github.com/ssoready/ssoready).\nSSOReady is an open-source (MIT) service that lets you implement SAML single sign-on without ever touching SAML yourself. You just need to implement two API endpoints: one to initiate SAML logins and another to receive incoming SAML messages. And then you're pretty much done.\nHere's me setting up SAML single sign-on in under a minute: (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_HVtFkW8xCI).\nYou can use our service with whatever tech stack or programming language you prefer.\nEarlier in my career, I worked on SAML authentication at Segment. I've been pretty obsessed with SAML since then. In the depths of the COVID pandemic, I even wrote an implementation of SAML in Go to entertain myself (https://github.com/ucarion/saml).\nOver the years, I've gotten really itchy to build better SAML tooling. There just aren't a lot of great options out there. Almost no one seems interested in making SAML easy for developers. Almost no one seems interested in writing clear documentation.\nWe're hoping to change that with SSOReady. We've open-sourced our codebase on an MIT license. You can do pretty much whatever you want with the code. Fork us. Self-host us.\nWe've also made the product entirely free.\nWhy free and open source? We're focused solitarily on becoming developers' first choice for SAML SSO. If it makes developers' lives easier, it works for us. We expect to monetize in the future by building extra features that serve large companies with complex needs. We don't see any point to being secretive or squeezing dollars out of small companies.\nI'd be thrilled if you gave the product a try, and I'd be really grateful for any feedback on your experience.\nIf you have any questions or concerns, my cofounder Ned and I will stay active on this thread throughout the day. You can also reach us directly at founders@ssoready.com. (We really mean this! We want to hear from you!)\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41110850\nPoints: 174\n# Comments: 65",

          "description": "ThinkPost is an Interactive split-panel diagramming, draggable block-based note-taking, and brainstorming tool.\nI developed ThinkPost as a side project for few months now. \nBasic idea is parallel streaming of ideas. It's a desktop web app with a very scaled down mobile version just for support.\nWhole my career I had been working with startups and specifically early stage ones, and it's a big responsibility to devise a feature on our own, think deeply about it in different streams (logically, security, re-usability, platform APIs etc.) and even present distilled part of it to stakeholders (Often times non technical people). Even now I run backend/infra/mobile/qa/customer support/integrations for a healthcare startup, so stakes are high. There's a lot of self brainstorming in multiple streams and then there's also distillation process. I couldn't really work with single page notepads for that streaming process. We should be able to note down in split-panels, so there's space for parallel ideas.\nMany note-taking apps today single-paged have high-think-threshold (windows notepad/apple notes have very low-think-threshold), you have to think before you write in them, so not a good option for quick ideas. So built a platform specifically for everyone who can parallel stream ideas in split panels Textually (low-think-threshold), write as they like), Diagrammatically, Code-wise or even Quick Maths. And also move the idea blocks across panels or within! or Open a new tab if you want more!\nI'm personally a massive user of my app because I plan everything at my current job via this app, run meetings, self-brainstorm features, study requirements, visualize code-ideas, an develop this when I get time as well. \nAll completely free. Might run ads later.\nhttps://thinkpost.io - Try! no login needed.\nMore comprehensive introduction: https://zameermfm.medium.com/introducing-thinkpost-io-33df61...\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41094159\nPoints: 17\n# Comments: 2",

We are building a tool that can silence alerts and help with debugging and root cause analysis. We also want to automate tedious parts of being on-call (running runbooks manually, answering questions on Slack, dealing with Pagerduty).\nHere is a quick video of how it works: https://youtu.be/m_K9Dq1kZDw\nI hated being on-call for a couple of reasons:\n* Alert volume: The number of alerts kept increasing over time. It was hard to maintain existing alerts. This would lead to a lot of noisy and unactionable alerts.

We’re Asankhaya and Rohan and we are building Patchwork.\nPatchwork tackles development gruntwork—like reviews, docs, linting, and security fixes—through customizable, code-first 'patchflows' using LLMs and modular code management steps, all in Python. Here's a quick overview video: https://youtu.be/MLyn6B3bFMU\nFrom our time building DevSecOps tools, we experienced first-hand the frustrations our users faced as they built complex delivery pipelines. Almost a third of developer time is spent on code management tasks[1], yet backlogs remain.\nPatchwork lets you combine well-defined prompts with effective workflow orchestration to automate as much as 80% of these gruntwork tasks using LLMs[2]. For instance, the AutoFix patchflow can resolve 82% of issues flagged by semgrep using gpt-4 (o…",

There's a demo video at https://www.loom.com/share/10067c49e4424b949a4b8c9fd8f3b12c?..., as well as example search results on our homepage.\nWe’re both physicists, and one of our biggest frustrations during grad school was finding research — There were a lot of times when we had to sit down to scope out new ideas for a project and quickly become a deep expert, or we had to find solutions to really complex technical problems, but the only way to do that was manually dig through papers on Google Scholar for hours. It was very tedious, to the point where we would often just skip the careful research and hope for the best. Sometimes you’d get burned a few months…",

          "description": "Hi HN, we’re building Haystack Editor (https://haystackeditor.com/), a canvas-based IDE that automates the boring stuff (plumbing, refactoring, and finding code) so that you can focus on the exciting parts of software development! You can see a quick overview of Haystack at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2uZnR5D_cc!\n(It's currently only on Mac OS but we're working on Linux and Windows.)\nHaystack was born out of our frustrations with working in large and mature codebases, specifically with navigating and editing functional flows (e.g. the code flow for adding an item to the Amazon shopping cart).\nOftentimes dealing with such flows would involve navigating a maze of files and functions, and making any edits would involve a lengthy process of doing corresponding downstream/upstream plumbing.\nHaystack attempts to address this in the following ways:\n    1. It allows you to explore your codebase as a directed graph of functions, classes, etc on the canvas. We feel like this better fits how your mind understands your codebase and helps you find and alter functional flows more intuitively. We especially want to utilize this for pull request reviews!\n\n    2. It has a navigational copilot that makes edits across files or functions much easier. After you make some changes, Haystack will try to predict your next action and create functions/methods or refactor upstream/downstream code for you. Haystack will surface these speculative edits on the canvas in a way that you can easily dismiss or incorporate them, allowing you to make large changes with a few clicks or keystrokes.\n\n    3. Haystack will utilize natural language search so you don’t have to play “Where’s Waldo” to find a functional flow in your codebase. This is coming soon!\n\n\nPSA: Since Haystack is a VS Code fork, you should be able to move your extensions and keyboard shortcuts. Please let us know if you have any issues with this!\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41068719\nPoints: 86\n# Comments: 44",

          "description": "This started out as a weekend hack with gpt-4-mini, using the very basic strategy of \"just ask the ai to ocr the document\".\nBut this turned out to be better performing than our current implementation of Unstructured/Textract. At pretty much the same cost.\nI've tested almost every variant of document OCR over the past year, especially trying things like table / chart extraction. I've found the rules based extraction has always been lacking. Documents are meant to be a visual representation after all. With weird layouts, tables, charts, etc. Using a vision model just make sense!\nIn general, I'd categorize this solution as slow, expensive, and non deterministic. But 6 months ago it was impossible. And 6 months from now it'll be fast, cheap, and probably more reliable!\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41048194\nPoints: 33\n# Comments: 22",

          "description": "Hi HN,\nWe're the Douglas Neuroinformatics Platform[1], and we've been working on Open Data Capture, a web-based electronic data capture (EDC) platform for continuous clinical and research data collection. You can use it to administer instruments (like forms and interactive tasks) either in-person or remotely.\nThe platform is based on a fundamentally longitudinal data model. Unlike other EDC platforms, which are centered around the concept of a study with rigid timepoints, Open Data Capture is designed for continuous data capture. Data is associated with a given session, which includes metadata such as date, time, and mode (i.e., in-person or remote).\nWe've designed the system around the core restriction that many hospital institutions demand that data remain on-premise, while clinician-res…",

          "description": "Hey, everyone\nI made a website that lets you find study partners/groups based on the specific course/book you are studying.\nIt's 100% free + no registration required.\nWhy:\nI know there are many subreddits for finding study partners. But, one of the biggest reasons we can't find the right partner/group is lack of clarity.\nMost posts that I read on Reddit were something like:\n\"I'm interested in programming. Let's study Python together...\" - That's not a clear goal.\nBut, when you say\n\"Let's study the Python for Everybody course on Coursera. I'm from Mumbai, India, and I'm looking for study partners in the* timezone (UTC+5:30). I'm fluent in Hindi language. I have 2 years of experience in C++, so I understand the fundamentals of programming. Happy to host the group and contribute\" - that will lead to higher quality engagement.\nIt's also difficult to search + filter posts on Reddit, based on my learning requirements.\nKeeping all these pain points in mind, I've built Moocable, where you can search & filter posts based on the course/book you're learning + timezones + languages + level of experience.\nLastly, you can use it to discover new learning materials. Some of you might have used https://www.classcentral.com/\nI'm building a similar library for Moocable, you can easily search and discover new learning materials.\nIf you are looking for study partners, give it a try!\nP.S.: I've manually filled the first ~100 posts. Each post is 100% authentic, scraped from subreddits/Coursera forums/niche websites.\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41024964\nPoints: 37\n# Comments: 11",

          "description": "Demo: https://designer.sendune.com/\nCode: https://github.com/SendWithSES/Drag-and-Drop-Email-Designer\nHTML for email is probably the hardest code to write. Even a teeny-tiny deviation from the rules will break the email in untold combination of os/desktop/mobile clients.\nIt's mid 2024. Almost 50 years since email was invented and 35 years since HTML was born. A 'basic-open-source-HTML-email-designer' must be a solved problem, right? We thought so too.\nSadly, that's not the case.\nThere are a few decent open source email designers but they carry dependencies that make them cumbersome to embed within your app. That's why we decided to open source our HTML Email Designer.\nThe SENDUNE email designer focuses on simplicity and ease of use. It is light-weight. It does pure HTML - no intermediate code wranglers like mjml. There is no lock-in of any kind. Save HTML output as a template and use with ANY email service provider.\nFeel free to fork the repository, make improvements, and submit pull requests.\nAMA: hello at sendune dot com\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41007403\nPoints: 254\n# Comments: 61",

I would like to know more because i think that this language might be a powerhouse in per se.\nSince my studies are quite basic in this regards i would like to expand my knowledge on it and kind of specialize myself both in this world and another world (ontologies :D) that i really enjoy.\nWhat's prolog like in 2024? what are you wonderful people doing with it?\nthanks from a dumbass :D\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40994552\nPoints: 282\n# Comments: 175",

          "description": "Hi, everyone. I created a note-taking website for electronics and circuits where you can draw circuit diagrams and write text notes at the same time.\nI am a Digital IC designer, and I self-study different types of analog and digital circuits a lot. However, I found a problem. Circuits have many different architectures and are hard to memorize due to numerous experiential tips. I want to document what I learn in my note app, but I found there is no method for me to easily draw circuit and block diagrams alongside text notes.\nThis issue has bothered me for a long time, from my master's school to my current working life. I decided to solve it, so I created a note-taking website specifically for electronics and circuits, called VisCircuit.\nWith VisCircuit, you can easily draw circuit diagrams, block diagrams, and write text notes simultaneously. I have already used it for two weeks and have noted down things I find hard to remember, such as SRAM, amplifier circuits, and PCB components of Arduino and Raspberry Pi. I found this tool really useful for memorizing knowledge about electronics and circuits.\nCurrently, I have opened VisCircuit for alpha testing, and I want to let some people use it and give me feedback. Feel free to try it, and I will really appreciate what you think about this project. Leave any suggestions for improvement. Thank you very much.\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40987770\nPoints: 32\n# Comments: 1",

See a demo: https://www.traceloop.com/video or try it yourself at https://www.traceloop.com/docs/demo.\nWhen moving your LLM app to production, significant scale makes it harder for engineers and data scientists alike to understand when their LLM is hallucinating or returning malformed responses. When you get to millions of calls to OpenAI a month, methods like “LLM as a judge” can’t work at a reasonable cost or latency. So, what most people we talked to usually do is sample some generations by hand, maybe for some specific important customers, and manually look for errors or hallucinations.\nTraceloop is a monitoring platform that d…",

          "description": "Hey Hacker News!\nThis is my first post here. About 5 months ago, I left my job because I was completely burnt out. After taking some time off, I started freelancing. But I found tracking my time to be a real hassle as I kept forgetting to start or stop the timer and often had no idea what I’d worked on.\nSo, I decided to build Taim as a side project, while also working now on some freelancing gigs. Taim is going to be automated time tracking tool for freelancers and teams. It’s designed to make tracking time effortless and accurate, so you can focus on your work and not worry about the clock.\nI’m excited to share this with you all and would love your feedback! Currently planning to launch it to the public in a few months.\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40977453\nPoints: 92\n# Comments: 57",

          "description": "Sometime in early 2022, my wife and I started watching Jeopardy! regularly, almost by accident. Inspired, I thought it would be fun to create and host my own games with family and friends.\nBy September 2022, I debuted Buzzinga at a family reunion. Back then, it was just a website running locally on my MacBook. It was a total blast, and I knew this was something the world should enjoy too.\nI launched Buzzinga.io in December 2023 and have been rolling out regular updates for our 2000+ users ever since.\nFeatures:\n- Built-in buzzer support (phones and physical buzzers)\n- Automatic scorekeeping\n- User-friendly host controls\n- Highly customizable\n- Supports multiple clue types: text, image, audio, and video\nThe site does not require sign up to play around with, only to create your own games.\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40960508\nPoints: 161\n# Comments: 38",

          "description": "So, I have always thought about what if Linux were to become very famous as a desktop OS that it starts coming pre-installed in most of the machine. To put it into perspective, Linux starts enjoying the same fame as Windows. \n Well, I believe that the OS like Linux mint- that are more beginners-friendly- will start to get pushed ahead. Companies and people will start developing OS that reassembles Windows in beginner friendliness. Eventually, I believe Linux will just become what Windows is today. People will not have to run commands in order to install stuff. Every app will support Linux natively. Sure, on the more deeper level, many things will surely change. But for an everyday user, I believe it will become so beginner friendly that they won't be able to tell windows and Linux apart.\n Of course, more for-tech-savvy OS would enjoy this surge of people but in proportion, not much. And the idea of Linux manifesting Windows is not really a good thing for me. \n    submitted by    /u/supus4562  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "A bit of context: I’ve been “programming” (let’s call it that, even if it’s just changing variable values) since I was a kid. I’ve always liked doing things my way, that is, taking something that already works and modifying it to my liking. I’ve been using Linux for about 7 years, trying out many distributions. At first, I obviously didn’t really understand what it was, so I saw it as “a different system from Windows that runs on my old laptop without any problems.” However, since I’ve always liked computing (I currently study Computer Science), I decided to gradually learn how this “Linux” thing works.\n It all really started one day when I damaged my PC’s motherboard while trying to update the BIOS (I’ve learned from my mistakes). Since I needed a computer, I had to resort to an old office PC that couldn’t run any games and where Windows was too slow. So, I decided to really try and experiment with Linux.\n Since that day, I fell into a rabbit hole that led me to where I am today. For almost 2 years now, I’ve been using Arch Linux (i use arch btw moment) as my daily distribution and OS, and I can say that I simply enjoy Linux. \n I have a group of friends at university who also use Linux, and it’s curious how, almost unanimously, they use Linux but don’t like tinkering with the system much. They find the idea of spending weeks tweaking configurations to center a bar and add a certain animation boring, but I really enjoy it. I spend hours modifying dotfiles to make the system look the way I want and creating scripts to automate any repetitive task. It’s simply a fun activity for me.\n I really just wanted to share this feeling, as I’ve recently realized how much fun I have simply making my system work the way I want.\n    submitted by    /u/Druxorey  \n [link]   [comments]",

Here's a very simple scenario suggesting the exact opposite:\n 1- Newcomer installs Linux\n 2- They open the GUI app store - that is most likely defaulting to flatpak - and install Steam\n 3- They try to add their existing external drive as a Steam library\n 4- They can't because sandbox\n Installing Steam and adding your existing library to it is the first thing a vast, vast majority of people they do on a newly installed system. It is not at all a good first impression that the first thing you do on Linux silently fails. No error messages, no indication why you can't add your drive.\n Most people don't know what's a flatpak, they don't know what's a sandbox, at this point they can't even Google for solutions because they don't know what's wrong. They have to:\n  \nFigure out Steam is installed as a Flatpak\n That Flatpak sandboxes applications\n That they need to punch a hole in the sandbox\n How to do that\n  \nall to just do something that's seemingly so simple.\n If you have spent any amount of time in Windows forums, I think you'll agree that most people won't be able to or be willing to Google their way out this issue. As a result, we get a flood of posts asking for help in irrelevant Linux communities.\n Unless Flatpaks are completely integrated in the desktop environment, e.g. you get a popup that asks if you want to allow Steam to access that drive when you try to add it, there's no way they're a good default distribution method.\n    submitted by    /u/Prestigious-Text9674  \n [link]   [comments]",

I've noticed a lot more people are talking about and trying out Linux due to the hatred of Windows 11, so now more than ever is a critical time to make a good first impression. I'm seeing a lot more videos popping up on my youtube feed of people trying out Linux for the first time, and in my opinion, flatpaks are mature enough to be promoted to Linux noobs as THE way to install software, and these videos would probably end more positively if we did. My daily driver is Debian 12 with almost all my software installed as flatpaks and I pretty much get no issues, everything \"just werks tm\". \n Flatpak's best feature is how easy it makes it to install software that's not on the official repos. When I first got into Linux, installing third-party software was my biggest pet peeve. Every time I went to a website, and the Linux install said \"add this repo\" it made me want to quit almost immediately, because doing this almost always gave me trouble, and I felt as though the more software I installed, the less stable my system got. With flatpaks this issue completely disappears. I can install and uninstall software with ease!

My distribution of choice is CachyOS which is based on Arch Linux, so I looked through the Arch Wiki's page about wireless network configuration. It turns out that I had to enable antenna aggregation for the iwlwifi driver. I added the following line to /etc/modprobe.d/iwlwifi.conf:\n  options iwlwifi 11n_disable=8 \n After rebooting my computer, my internet speed become just as fast as it was on Windows.

The system could no longer mount /dev/mapper/home_crypt which was formatted as btrfs and had 30 TiB worth of data.\n [623.753147] BTRFS error (device dm-0): parent transid verify failed on logical 29520190603264 mirror 1 wanted 393320 found 392664 [623.754750] BTRFS error (device dm-0): parent transid verify failed on logical 29520190603264 mirror 2 wanted 393320 found 392664 [623.754753] BTRFS warning (device dm-0): failed to read log tree [623.774460] BTRFS error (device dm-0): open_ctree failed \n After spending hours reading the fantastic manuals and the online forums, it appeared to me that the btrfs check --repair option is a dangerous one. Luckily I was still able to run mount -o ro,rescue=all and eventually completed the incremental backup since the last backup.\n My geek friend (senior sysadmin) and I both agreed that I should re-format it as ext4. His justification was that even if I get battery and UPS in place, there's still a chance that these can fail, and that a kernel panic can also potentially trigger the same issue with btrfs. As btrfs has not been endorsed by RHEL yet, he's not buying it for production.\n The whole process took me a few days to fully restore from backup and bring the server back to production.\n Think twice if you plan to use btrfs for your production server.\n    submitted by    /u/etherealshatter  \n [link]   [comments]",

The connection was established successfully.\n A few minutes later, he attempted to browse my home directory, looking for some files. To stop him, I decided to stop the sshd service I had started earlier. After stopping the service and checking the status, it showed: \"Stopping OpenSSH daemon. Deactivated successfully. Stopped OpenSSH daemon.\" I thought the SSH connection would be terminated, but my friend on the call told me, \"I can still access your system.\" Upon checking with netstat, the connection was still established.\n So, I want to ask why the session didn’t terminate after stopping sshd. Is this a bug or a feature?\n Can someone please explain what exactly is happening?\n    submitted by    /u/w453y  \n [link]   [comments]",

This can be very daunting to someone who has naver done this before, and even if you have it can be cumbersome and annoying.\n The experience of installing linux should be: - googling: <distro> download - clicking on for example \"installer for windows\" on the distros website - running the program they downloaded, which allows them to partition thiere drive and reboot into the installer.\n This even already exists for asahi linux on macos.\n Now I'm wondering why there isn't anything like it available on windows for different distros, atleast for like ubuntu, mint, fedora and the likes. This would make it way easier for people to install linux.\n    submitted by    /u/einsJannis  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hello! I'm a power user of Kubuntu and have been for years. I wanted to share some joy of mine.\n I've been using Wayland with the Nvidia drivers and KDE Plasma 5 for a while now, but there were minor bugs that have been annoying me. The biggest ones for Kubuntu 24.04 are flicker in Electron applications and the application dashboard and KRunner randomly failing to open sometimes.\n Today I booted into a live CD environment for the latest Kubuntu 24.10 daily and installed Plasma 6 from the staging PPA and Nvidia drivers 555 from the graphics drivers PPA. To my pleasant surprise, everything is rock solid and smooth. There's no flicker, no tearing, and the only graphical bug I noticed was black folder icons in Dolphin.\n I'm actually seriously considering updating to this franken-OS in my main installation instead of waiting for Plasma 6 packages to land in the official repository.\n Warning! The Plasma 6 staging PPA is unstable and can brick your OS if you don't know what you're doing. I had to manually fix some broken dependencies by downloading .deb packages from Launchpad, so don't try this at home unless you really know what you're doing. The packages prepared in the PPA should soon land in Kubuntu 24.10 proper, though, before feature freeze in mid-August.\n Here's a screenshot:\n https://preview.redd.it/vgnwzc1sohgd1.png?width=3840&format=png&auto=webp&s=304f9b46ab2a2e9731dce44120e60b8076b917d3\n    submitted by    /u/Linneris  \n [link]   [comments]",

I also don't think maintainers are incompetent, I supposed they were and compiled their own version, that's why the issue -due to my misunderstanding - seemed weird. I have the utmost respect for maintainers \n A group of crackers started committing patches to xz repository, those patches, in a non trivial way, composed the backdoor.\n After that they pressured the xz maintainer to be co-maintainers and be able to sign the releases. Then they proceeded to release a signed the backdoored release.\n The signing the release was key in enabling the backdoor.\n Am I wrong about that? If that's the case, wouldn't it have been solved if maintainers compiled their own version of xzutils for each distro? \n I'm trying to figure it all out to counterpoint that it's not the problem that it's a free software project which caused the issue (given that invoking kerchoff's principle seems not to be enough)\n    submitted by    /u/roberto_sf  \n [link]   [comments]",

If so why?\n I imagine it would be easier for most non-tech users to use a Windows environment.\n I am by no means bashing RHEL, I'm just confused as to what they do exactly?\n I have seen they have quite a lot of big name customers, but again, why?\n    submitted by    /u/schizochode  \n [link]   [comments]",

Is there any oversight or accountability for this? Isn't this a concern?\n edit - yes I know Lunduke tries to stir up drama and is not the most unbiased source.

They relocate the start menu, introduce ribbons, add new animations and transitions, and generally clutter the system. This approach increases system requirements, wasting drive space, memory, CPU, and GPU resources without offering significant benefits.\n  \n In contrast, Linux Mint's approach prioritizes stability and usability.

For context I tried many terminal solutions, used ChatGPT a lot, and was stuck with my driver not working - error on start up: failed to load Nvidia persistent services. Tried different distros, kde was not even starting, and nearly gave up entirely. Super pumped I passed my first hurdle. \n As a note, I knew beforehand Nvidia would be trouble, but I need it for work. I also reached out to this board yesterday asking for help and my post was removed by mods. Very disappointed, as the accessibility of community support can be hard to find.

Linux has a golden rule: don't break user space. Unfortunately, people who depend on accessibility software find this rule broken constantly.\n That's not even including how Wayland completely broke how screen readers are able to work.

I love Gnome in it's vanilla state, and I think the only thing that is missing are optional tiling functions.\n The preview we saw in GUADEC 2023 about the tiling concepts looked absolutely amazing. \n Generally I try to completely stay away from extensions but the only extension I'll allow myself to use is one that enables basic window tiling. \n I see all the hype around COSMIC OS and most of it appears to be about the built in tiling. So I'm definitely not the only one who wants it. I'm hoping that at the minimum, someone can port the COSMIC OS tiling features into a Gnome extension. So those of us who want tiling could use that until Gnomes official tiling gets finished.\n What do you guys think? Are any of you excited for built in tiling on Gnome?\n    submitted by    /u/Wigglingdixie  \n [link]   [comments]",

I found out that Okular does not even show replies to comments -- a basic feature I would think. This is a deal-breaker when you receive documents with comments and replies every day. So, I tested different Windows and Linux PDF tools and here are the results: \n  \nAcrobat Pro (Windows, commercial): shows/edits comments and replies\n PDF-XChange (Windows only, commercial): ditto\n Master PDF Editor (commercial): ditto \n OnlyOffice: ditto \n Firefox: only shows comments and replies (replies displayed as separate sticky)\n Chromium: only shows comments and replies (replies displayed as separate sticky)\n Okular: shows/edits comments but not replies \n Draw: only indicates comments as icons; highlight covers text\n PDF Arranger: only indicates comments as icons (naturally) \n Atril: no comments\n  \nIt seems the only options are OnlyOffice and Master PDF, which are limited in other ways. It doesn't look very good, and I can't even understand why PDF editing is not supported fully on Linux, possibly even as part of LibreOffice. \n    submitted by    /u/gl0cal  \n [link]   [comments]",

It works fine overall but has some issues, and I'm wondering if these will ever be addressed.

Even doing that is hell, because everything looks shit by default.\n Last time I wanted to use, god forbids, 2-3 simple animitations to highlight stuff. That seemed to break a lot of stuff. Some text just disappeared. Some text just froze and I couldn't change anymore. When I saved the file, the saved file didn't contain any images.

I had long-standing bug of very slow wakeup-from-suspend - it could take 10 to 15 seconds until screen lights up and system becomes responsible. It started in Q2 2022, and after that no amount of tinkering allowed it to be fixed. Until recently, when my wife's machine got quite wet, and I replaced my SSD with her's to let her work while her motherboard dried up. Of course Windows did what it like to do the most - disabled my UEFI and enabled secureboot. After swapping SSD back and fixing the bootloader, I found out that the slow wakeup bug disappeared completely.

          "description": "When I first discovered Linux about four years ago, I was using beginner-friendly distributions such as Linux Mint, Manjaro, and Ubuntu. After that, I switched to Arch Linux then Gentoo with DWM as my window manager. Because Gentoo forces you to basically set up your OS and what software you want on it, I learned so much about Linux from using it. I loved the productivity gains I got from using DWM as my window manager.\n However, over the years, I realized that I was spending more time configuring my system than actually using it. I was applying as many patches as possible to DWM for increased productivity and speed. I compiled all my packages with several C compiler optimizations such as LTO, Graphite, march=native, -O3, etc. All of this didn't actually make a noticeable impact, it was more of an obsession I had with squeezing the most performance and productivity out of my system as I possibly could. Basic things like configuring my monitor setup was difficult on such a minimal configuration. I came to the realization that the law of diminishing returns is completely true. I became less productive and less focused on my work as I continued to try to optimize my system further.\n I recently installed CachyOS with the graphical installer and chose KDE Plasma as my desktop environment. I have to admit that the user experience is just better. I can still tile windows if I want, it's just not automatic. I can also set up keyboard shortcuts so that I don't have to use the mouse often. Honestly, KDE Plasma can do most things a tiling window manager can do and much more. It \"just works.\" I have come full circle. I feel like the IQ bell curve meme applies perfectly to this situation.\n Having said all of that, do I regret trying Gentoo and DWM? No. I learned so much about Linux and low-level C programming just by tinkering with them that in the end I think it was worth it. But it definitely won't be my daily driver.\n    submitted by    /u/SaltyMaybe7887  \n [link]   [comments]",

Even if the year comes around it shouldn’t be called the “year of the Linux desktop” it should be called whatever the most popular operating system that uses the kernel is because Linux is a kernel, not an operating system.\n My guess is if there is a “year” of the Linux desktop it will have to be in 20 years.

          "description": "In the summer of 1999 I began working on a C++ code generator. When I gave Bjarne Stroustrup a demo of it in 2003, I had a web interface. Eventually I realized that I should develop a command line interface and I was able to start doing so in 2009. For a short time, I had a 2-tier system with the command line front end. It wasn't long before I added a middle tier. Today it's implemented as a 3-tier system where each of the tiers is in C++.\n I started with Red Hat and used Arch and a number of distros until around 2014 when I switched to FreeBSD primarily due to wanting to use the kqueue/kevent API. Then around 2022 I switched back to Linux primarily to be able to use io-uring. My front tier, though, is very portable and also runs on Windows, MacOS, and the BSDs.\n Because my back tier is proprietary, there are some who have not appreciated my work. I'm sorry but making the service available for free is the best I can do. \n It's been a wild ride. Back when I gave Stroustrup a demo I was broke from investing in my company. I was living with a 96-year-old woman with two small dogs she didn't allow outside. Part of my rent was cleaning up after the dogs. Her first name was Constance -- it took me a while to realize that was a great name for a roommate to someone working on a C++ code generator.\n Thanks for reading.

Both GRUB bootloader and Linux live on the same disk (which I have verified with lsblk), Windows on the other. By all logic, this setup should prevent Windows from accidentally overriding the GRUB bootloader with the Windows bootloader. \n However, when I booted into Windows, I saw a loading bar reminiscence of a Windows 7 loading bar. Perhaps it was a large update, but right after this, when I switched my boot order back to GRUB, I was immediately greeted by a rescue shell as GRUB gave me an \"unknown filesystem error\". \n The fix was easy enough using a liveUSB, chroot and grub-install + grub-update, but it left me thinking how I can prevent this from happening to me again. I was also wondering if anyone else has faced this issue, despite also having their Linux and Windows physical boot disk being two separate drives. Did Microsoft make some changes such that Windows even checks other drives now for EFI partitions?\n Also, I know some people might give the meme answer of \"Don't use Windows\", but unfortunately school work requires some really iffy programs that only works on Windows. \n    submitted by    /u/Derpythecate  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "TLDR, can you guys think of any other examples of this?\n So, there's this video editor for Linux called DaVinci Resolve Studio, and although it's available for all three operating systems, the Linux version doesn't support AAC audio. What this effectively means is anything you record on a standard consumer device like a phone or a budget camera or OBS out of the box will have no sound unless you convert it first.\n Why? Well, this is just extrapolation on my part, but I found out that the license holders for AAC demand it be paid on a per-device basis. Even though you can get Windows for free, Windows and Mac can both be assumed to have already paid the licensing fee. With Linux, you can't count on anything like that. Even if they sold a plug-in to add the functionality, you would have to activate it on every computer you installed it on, or they would have to work out a deal where you could buy the codec for Linux itself on every Linux install. This would most likely stop Adobe Premiere from supporting it if it ever got ported to Linux.\n The reason why free programs like Shotcut and kdenlive are able to support it is because they aren't being used for commercial work. I don't understand how myself, but in the DaVinci Resolve subreddit, I found out that Hollywood actually scans your work to make sure that everything was above board, and if you tried using one of these free programs, it would get flagged. And Hollywood's not using AAC audio anyway. Well, outside of the trailers, they post on social media, but that's probably coming from a Mac device instead of a Linux device.\n Anyways, that's one example of how the free and customizable nature of Linux can hamper the functionality of cross-platform software. The functionality of our computers is held hostage by legal BS. Can you think of any other programs that would run into this kind of patent nonsense that would keep it from being able to be ported on Linux?\n    submitted by    /u/Indolent_Bard  \n [link]   [comments]",

At the moment, i got all macs, just purchased a mac book air 15. \n Amazing laptop, I've always loved the Gnome flavoring it has, but the real issue is i need dictation (speech to text) due to my disability. i need help with spelling a lot, and it effects my workflow. \n I've already tried in the past talking with devs directly, but it looks like the developers of those accessibility channels aren't getting funding at all to actually implement those features. if i could afford it, i'd 1000% do it. \n If they did get it figured out, i'd most likely sell my mac for a Panasonic tough book fz-55 with dual battery expansion. I prefer longer battery life then i do anything else. \n    submitted by    /u/Decent-Principle8918  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Before using Wayland, I was on X11 with DWM as my window manager. I wanted a similar setup for Wayland. I tried three tiling Wayland compositors, DWL, River, and Hyprland. However, I experienced a lot of issues with all of them. For one, on DWL, you can't change your XKB keyboard layout configuration at runtime. Because of this, I switched to River. However, River, like most Wayland compositors, doesn't give you the ability to disable vsync for certain windows. This is important for games because you want the lowest latency possible. Finally, I switched to Hyprland. Hyprland gives you the ability to disable vsync for fullscreen applications. However, Hyprland is full of bugs. Some Wayland applications don't work on it and screen recording with OBS causes the framerate to dip.\n Ultimately, the fact is that there isn't one option that is free of major bugs and has all the features I want. There's just less variety on Wayland than X11 at the moment. In addition to that, I don't like Wayland's philosophy. It wants to force compositors to be a certain way. Basic things like using keybinds for OBS become difficult as a result. What if I want to disable vsync for the entire compositor? What if I want to not have a compositor altogether and just use a window manager? This is just not possible on Wayland. I don't like the fact that X11 will be obsoleted in favour of a restrictive protocol.\n    submitted by    /u/SaltyMaybe7887  \n [link]   [comments]",

One thing that recently stood out to me since migrating to Linux is Crostini's Terminal feels rather quick, but this also puzzled me. Why does my somewhat dated Chromebook feel fast while my overpowered Linux system feels just a little less fast?\n Like most things Linux, I did a little research and found the culprit; my Keyboard Repeat Delay and Rate Settings don't feel ideal for my system. So, I quickly made some changes to these and, voila, Konsole and everything keyboard related (you do use the keyboard right?) is speedy! Yay! That said, if you configure this and it feels just a little too fast, try to give yourself a little time to get used to it before reverting the changes.\n Hope this helps someone else enjoy Linux even more!\n Cheers.\n    submitted by    /u/BinkReddit  \n [link]   [comments]",

Was a good reliable phone to me, as long as it lasted. \n On the + site i got WH-XB910N as a campaign gift, so I forgive sony for the phones short lifespan.\n MOTO G54, an upgrade VS Xperia 10 V ?\n Buying Motorola G54 5G for 15$ on sale, which is perfect, since im on a tight budget. Never had a motorola before, would love to hear opinions, tips and tricks, etc. Enjoy rest of the summer, and please remember to take good care of each other.

          "description": "There are plenty of native, OEM and third-party apps for creating shortcuts; from remapping the Bixby key, Power key double-press/press-and-hold, double/triple tap device back, One Hand Operations+, etc. And there are some famous (most of them deprecated) gesture apps, like GMD Gesture Controls, Air Gestures, and many others.\n I'm really interested in optimizing productivity using these kinds of shortcuts. But maybe I just don't use my phone enough, or I don't have a lot of apps that I use very regularly. Even my home screen is kept clean with minimal apps (I usually use search to get to what I need).\n So, looking for some ideas and inspiration, what do you guys assign to your shortcuts on your device?\n    submitted by    /u/VonLoewe  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "It might be just nostalgia, or fear from changes.. but honestly, I feel like all the recent years' updates both provide some useful and cool features, but also break some things\n And on top of all that, google seems to be reinventing the wheel too much, and changing the standards really often. Don't even get me started on the design guidelines, which often aren't followed by the Google-made apps\n There are so many drastic changes with layout of the UI, APIs like the filesystem behavior and so on, and that causes huge compatibility issues with older apps and cross-version support in general, and also confuses the developers\n Again, I might be exaggerating, but that's what I feel about the recent updates\n    submitted by    /u/creeper828  \n [link]   [comments]",

I wrote an article over on Android Authority that explains why this new equal loudness feature is pretty nifty. \n To celebrate the update, the developer gave me 100 promo codes to give away across my social media channels. Those promo codes were quickly snatched up, so he issued me another 100 to give away. After giving away some more, I'm left with 47 promo codes that I figured some of y'all might like, so here they are! \n Edit: The codes may have all been redeemed by now. There's no way for me to check, but that's what some people are reporting.\n To redeem a code, first open one of the below links, use Google Lens or something similar to copy from the image, open the Google Play Store app on your phone, tap on your profile picture, tap on Payments & subscriptions, tap on Redeem code, and then enter the promo code in the text box that appears.\n Promo codes 1-24 \n Promo codes 25-47\n If you want to know how to set up equal loudness in Wavelet, my article on Android Authority explains how. If I got anything wrong in my article or you want to add something, do let me know!\n (I am not affiliated with the Wavelet dev nor is this sponsored/a paid promotion. In accordance with rule 8 of this sub, I asked the mods if I could post this giveaway, and they allowed it.)\n    submitted by    /u/MishaalRahman  \n [link]   [comments]",

Whatever corners are cut to keep pricing competitive also affect it. On top of it, smartphone reviewers don't usually talk much about longevity of the phone model.\n So, for someone getting a phone for long term usage, what are the things to look out for. It makes sense that flagships usually last longer due to better materials, more care and longer software support, but these things apply to mid-range as well as low-range phone.\n I am listing some things that I can think of.

You can also get the tag to play a sound directly from this app. It has a find tag button which then takes you into the Google FMD app - Chipolo doesn't have a companion app or any ability to update FW.\n \nDouble pressing the button makes your phone ring/play a sound so that you can locate that if you misplaced it - Chipolo…",

          "description": "TLDR: So far they've never worked unless they were near my phone.\n I'm moving 500km across Canada, with Toronto being the origin. I'd preordered a pair of Pebblebee Tag for Android's last spring and they finally arrived a month or so ago. So I packed the two trackers in different boxes when the movers were here to see if I could track the moving truck as it moved across the country.\n The movers finished loading everything early afternoon on Wednesday July 24th and so far they were last seen at 12:41pm on July 24h... The last time I was personally standing next to the truck my phone. Four nights later there has not been a single update and our belongings are expected to be unloaded at our new home tomorrow morning. I don't expect them to be located again until I once again stand newer the truck.\n The 'Find My Device Network' seems to be missing the 'network' part. It's just my phone, all alone tracking these. I was considering getting one of the Chipolo trackers that uses a CR2032 battery for our cat, since it'll be easier for her to escape outdoors. But what use is a tracker that can basically tell you one of two things: The tracker is within Bluetooth range of your phone' and 'The tracker is NOT within Bluetooth range of your phone.'\n These are seemingly useless and I can't believe I spent over a year waiting for these.\n    submitted by    /u/AshleyUncia  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "So, just as I avoid modern Apple products, especially dislike IOS devices, I'm not a fan of Jony Ive. Seems like far too much form over function design for me. But he'll probably be remembered in 100 years as an iconic designer. Of course he's sadly (IMO) arguably quite heavily influenced many Android devices to go pretty form over function, too. \n I suppose there's a big divide between those Android users who really just want their device to do stuff well and those who really care about it's looks. Anyway, Android is so huge that you'd think at least one top phone designer would have become world famous? If not another iconic Android phone company head too, in a similar way to Steve Jobs.\n But I couldn't name, say, Samsung's head Android device designer, without looking it up, nor the CEO. HTC had pretty iconic premium designs (if you like that kind of thing), same for them. Unlike the Nexus, Google entirely design the Pixel themselves, don't they? But whoever designs them doesn't seem to have become famous at all. Why have (AFAIK) no very important Android people become famous? At least not in the west (different in Asia?)/outside of tech enthusiast circles.\n    submitted by    /u/TessaKatharine  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Stop me if you've heard this one before; Whatsapp is borderline malware. It is a third party app that somehow manages to grant itself such a heightened level of positions that it is able to override Do Not Disturb settings, which are baked into the OS. Here's a list of other apps that can do this:\n •\n •\n •\n And it has been happening for years. \n Proof 1\n Proof 2\n And I'll let you search for more threads because these aren't the only two. \n I know that we willingly compromise some of our security owning a smartphone in general, however this type of malicious behavior by third party app is where I draw the line. Remember all the outrage about the crazy stuff TikTok can do on your phone? Seems like it's time to put WhatsApp in the same category. \n If you care about your personal privacy and security at all, I suggest removing WhatsApp until Meta / the WhatsApp development team addresses this malicious behavior publicly. They haven't bothered to address it for years now, so I'm not holding my breath, but I'm done rewarding this company's continued assaults on privacy.\n    submitted by    /u/kwest12  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Let me preface this by saying I'm excited about new players in the smartphone market, but there's something about Nothing's approach that rubs me the wrong way. Here's why:\n  \nApple Comparisons Everywhere: Every interview, every tweet seems to be a veiled jab at Apple while giving off \"fake Steve Jobs\" Vibes . It's great to have competition, but constantly comparing yourself to the biggest name is tiring. Focus on what makes Nothing unique and not on gimmicks. \n Misleading Innovation Claims: The transparent back with LED lights (Glyph Interface) is cool, but is it truly innovative? True Modular phones have been around for ages (think Motorola Moto Z) unlike the fake modular CMF phone (see the latest Jerry rig everything video). Phrases like \"breaking new ground\" feel exaggerated. Who can forget the fake and over the top reactions to the first Nothing phone.\n Sustainability vs. Charger Omission: Preaching sustainability while not including a charger in a $200 phone and giving a removable back panel in CMF phone while glueing the battery is a bad look. \n  \nNow, let's look at the competition:\n Apple: Whether you love them or hate them, Apple has a long history of groundbreaking tech (think the original iPhone and the M1 chip).\n Samsung: Pioneering foldable displays is a huge accomplishment, pushing the boundaries of smartphone design.\n Xiaomi: Their focus on powerful cameras and innovative designs like glass backs has made them a major player.\n Google: Computational photography is a game-changer, and Google leads the way in this area.\n So, what has Nothing brought to the table? Right now, it feels mostly like gimmicks. The modular phone claims haven't materialized and Carl Pie had the audacity to say that no one has been doing any innovation in smartphone space in last 10 years.\n P.S. I'm open to having my mind changed! I If you think Nothing is bringing real innovation, share your thoughts below.\n    submitted by    /u/Alarmed_Atmosphere  \n [link]   [comments]",

Completing a run on Tier 2 will unlock Tier 3, and so on - There are infinite tiers, and they get harder and harder. Starting with Tier 2 you can face the true final boss, and attempt to unlock other secrets & areas. There is a lot more coming, so grab your Sword, Bow, or Wand and head into the Dungeon!\n Can check out Dungeon Hero here if curious!

          "description": "背景\n最近一直在用 iOS 的 Safari 上网，发现一些网站密码只存在 LastPass ，但它切换设备要收费，替换它刻不容缓，虽然现在都 2024 年了。\n我的需求很简单\n抛开安全先不谈，只需要多端同步密码即可，因为有些重要的账号都是需要手机号验证。\n我目前密码需要同步的几个端：\nMac + 谷歌浏览器\nUbuntu + 谷歌浏览器\niPhone + Safari 浏览器\nWindows + 谷歌浏览器（偶尔用也要有）\n安卓 + 谷歌浏览器（基本不用也要有）\n实现过程\n上网查了资料后，Keepass 满足了我的需求，大概理解了下：\nKeepass 的所有密码是存在一个后缀为 kdbx 的数据库加密文件里。\n必须有一个正确的主密钥，才能访问和操作 kdbx 内容，主密钥可以是文本密码。\n各个端使用 Keepass 兼容的图形软件工具，它们能做到添加、编辑、在网站自动填充密码，本质上就是操作 kdbx 文件。\n思路\n所以只要在一个端设置账号密码，其他端同步过去，就能实现共用。\n也就是实现 kdbx 文件云同步事关键，文件同步我选择使用 OneDrive ，单独申请了个账号，专用存 kdbx 文件，它免费额度有 5G ，根本用不完。\n主密钥我用的是一个文本密码，记在了脑子里。\n最终的同步方案：\nPC + 谷歌浏览器用的 KeepassXC ，它提供浏览器插件，支持识别 URL 写入和填充账号密码。\nMac 和 Windows 有现成的图形化软件。\nUbuntu 我用的是命令行安装，它默认的云文件路径是在 ~/OneDrive ，需要后台运行 onedrive --synchronize 命令才能一直进行同步操作。\n手机 iOS 我使用了 KeePassium 和 Strongbox ，最终选择了 Strongbox ，原因是 Strongbox 免费版自动填充效果比较好。\n虽然 KeePassium 和 Strongbox 软件自身都集成了 OneDrive 云同步的设置，但本质上还是第三方授权拉 OneDrive 的数据。\n我试了下直接用手机装额外的 OneDrive ，直接打开 OneDrive 的文件速度会快一些，也就是说没有用 Strongbox 的云同步功能（ KeePassium 也是一样），而是像打开本地文件一样打开 OneDrive 的文件。\n结论\nOneDrive 用来同步，需要自己记一下账号密码。\n不能丢 kdbx 的主密钥，如果你存的密码很重要，建议你把它当加密钱包一样保存。\n目前我都是免费用这几个工具，KeePassium 和 Strongbox 有进阶版收费，但免费版对我来说很够用。\n安卓的我用的不多，不过我看大家推荐最多的还是 Keepass2Android ，有需要的可以试一试。\n想要实现同款方案的\n如果想尝试跟我一样的方案,可以跳到我这篇博客最后面简单看看 使用 Keepass 实现跨平台密码同步",

          "description": "前言\n入职游戏公司大半个月了，公司是自研自发运营一体一条龙，在其中一个研发工作室的游戏客户端岗位实习。我是民办二本 25 应届生，找了好久都没找到实习，后面现在这家公司 HR 联系到了我，最后拿到了这家公司的 offer ，这是我的第一份实习。\n入职前期\n前面的时间都是在了解项目源码和工作流，熟悉项目的结构和数据流向，没有说立刻上手就搞开发。\n在这期间，我基本都是梳理逻辑，数据走向还没清楚。遇到不懂的我都会去请教组长或者组员，他们真的很好，很热心，很愿意去解答，真的很给力。\n入职中期\n花了大概一周时间了解近项目后，组长和我面谈，问我在组里怎么样，适不适应，以及未来的规划。\n我还挺喜欢组里的氛围的，我告诉组长觉得挺不错的，并且也愿意干下去。组长也给了我一些建议，告诉我这条路如何走。\n我简单总结一下他说的，长远目标来说：把现有项目框架吃透，熟悉整体的工作流和业务逻辑，实习生路还很很长，把现在的项目学了，对自己都是有帮助的。\n后面他安排了一个组员带我，让我开始接手代码重构，mentor 和组长都说，不懂的话问就行了。\n我任务把前面写的代码能封装的都封装起来，mentor 也会问我情况怎么样，我也会去跟他汇报当前的进度，遇到的问题。\n他时不时会拿代码重构的那些部分来问我，为什么这块代码这样写，优点是什么，缺点是什么，重构的话应该怎么改怎么封装最合适，我不知道他也会说，也让我在这个过程中也对项目有更近一步的认识。\n如今状况\n现在也完成了代码重构，组长也开始安排一些小需求和优化给我，我也能慢慢的上手。\n这周安排了一个业务逻辑给我，我当时跟策划对的时候也大致了解需求，这个业务逻辑不需要大改，总体逻辑是不变的，入口或者一些小地方需要更改。\n我的 mentor 问我做业务做得怎么样，我说目前在尝试着修改，边写边了解业务逻辑，看是否这样做能达到业务需求，然后我的 mentor 和组长听了，都叫停我了。\n尝试性编程\n他们叫停我了我，然后让我去把数据流向和有关该业务逻辑的都去看一遍，捋清楚需要改什么，不需要改什么，数据怎么传输，传输到哪里去 等等，把这些了解清楚了改。\n我当时被否定了还觉得有点难受的，我也没问为什么，就照样做。\n后面我问我组长，我大致了解了工作流程，基本逻辑，为什么不能尝试性编程？\n组长原话\n\"你要分清楚场合，对于技术攻关来说，你有个技术点不明白，你尝试是 OK 的；对于业务来说，这个是你写的东西，你需要了解你自己写的东西，知道数据的走向，以及你这个业务的整个逻辑脉络，你都要清楚，如果你尝试性编程，也就是说你还不了解业务逻辑，那么，你就要去梳理它。\"\n\"当策划提出需求的时候，如果你不能把需求拆分出一个又一个的点的时候，说明你还有不明白的地方，这个就是你要去实习的，而尝试性编程，对于你来说就是靠猜，没办法把东西消化成为自己的。\"\n\"我不管做一个框架或者做一个模块，我都要清楚我要的是什么，数据的传输、走向，你的整体是什么，整理里面又需要些什么，然后在慢慢的去扩展这些，我说的这个不是说让你怎么样怎么样，主要是一个思路：你想东西不要只想到一个点，你要想到的是面，这个面里面需要哪些点去组成，这些点又是怎么组成这个面的。\"\n\"对于我这个职位来说，我需要兜住每一个组员写的代码，清楚整个流程走向。而你，则是要养成这个习惯，不说框架有多大，先把你这个业务搞清楚，知道逻辑，知道走向，尝试性编程只会让你一知半解。\"\n后话\n我没见识过啥职场，不知道这正不正常，我真心觉得我组长和整组人都挺好，挺热情的，是我的错觉？",

          "description": "中午看到一个关于 Twitter 使用的热帖，本来想下班后梳理下再回，结果回不了了于是开了个新主题。\n首先声明，这个主题是为了从信息安全的角度讨论如何保护自己和账号，为了避免吵起来最后进水深火热，请勿在此主题内讨论下面这些话题\n对绕过 GFW 这一行为的讨论\n对反诈等政策的讨论\n社会议题\n此主题也不讨论使用 Twitter 的目的，无论是涉政、涉黄、加密货币还是其他\n请将讨论控制在技术方案本身，不要发散开来。感谢各位的理解和配合\n正题：关于正常使用 Twitter 的一些想法\n不要使用和国内账号相同、相近的用户名和头像。相信都能理解。也不要用个性化的用户名，最好使用在线工具随机生成一个用户名，然后让 Twitter 自动为你附加数字生成一个不重复的用户名。\n不要和其他账号共用邮箱和手机号，建议单独新建一个 proton 的邮箱，并且使用 proton 的加号别名（类似 Gmail ）来注册。如果你之前使用的是+86 的号码或者邮箱与别的账号混用，建议注销账号重新申请。绑定手机号时也改成使用国外手机号码。\n如果你的 Twitter 注册得很早，那你可能没有绑定手机，Twitter 似乎也没有强制这一批账号再补上手机绑定。\n关于如何获得一个国外手机号码，站内和很多博客都有资料，就不在这里讨论了。\n新建 proton 邮箱是为了避免和过去你的其他账号产生关联，使用+号别名是为了尽可能避免某天你又将这个邮箱用于别的账号（当然这是不建议的），那可以祈祷脚本没有把+号别名映射到你真实邮箱地址。\n在“设置”——“隐私和安全”里关闭允许通过邮箱和手机查找你的功能\n在“设置”——“安全性和账号访问权限”里开启双重身份验证。顺便一提，v2ex 也支持此功能很久了，可以也设置一下\n同样是“设置”——“安全性和账号访问权限”里，开启密码重设保护。此设置默认关闭，这导致能够通过你的用户名获得你手机号和邮箱的首尾信息；开启此设置后，如果你需要重置密码，需要输入完整的邮箱名，所以不要忘记注册时使用的邮箱了\n如果你不希望别人知道你关注了谁，可以通过创建私密列表来实现类似关注的功能\nTwitter 大约从今年 6 月起隐藏了对推文点赞的用户列表，但指定用户的关注列表仍然是可以看到的，并且 circleboom 这样的第三方工具也能够查到关注列表。而用户创建的私密列表是不公开的。\n如果你很在意，最好的办法就是只当信息的接收者。\n如果你只是看，建议关闭私信功能，避免哪天不小心点到里面的钓鱼链接\n无论是什么平台，都不要安装客户端，完全在浏览器内使用。当然，应当使用可信任的浏览器。\n不定期修改一下你的用户名：Twitter 有内部 ID 来识别用户，但爬虫不一定拿得到\n以上这些想法是基于下面这些出发点：\n认为 Twitter 比较可信，也相应利用 Twitter 提供的安全机制保护自己的账号\n但也不完全信任 Twitter：这里不讨论 Twitter 是否有内鬼（也请各位不要扩展讨论避免吵起来）。但在内鬼之外，即使 Twitter 有各种安全机制，也难免会因为漏洞导致数据库泄露等安全问题（ 2022 年），因此最好使用单独的邮箱地址\n这些工作可能略显繁琐，每个人对信息安全也有自己的理解，很正常。觉得自作多情多此一举的朋友请单独开主题批判我，我无意争吵所以如果有类似话题我也不会回复，谢谢～\n不尽之处也欢迎各位讨论和指正。",

          "description": "其实不算是两“周年”，已经两年多了，之前一直很忙没怎么更新，但是想了想，这一篇还是要写。\n还记得当初，由于疫情一直待在家，自己觉得不如找点事做，于是就有了这个公众号，最初基本是一天一篇的，后来随着我越来越忙碌，也就是不定时更新了，但是现在仍然有一千多个支持我的朋友，在此先感谢各位。\n\n最近实在是忙碌，马上升大四了，要准备考研，要准备毕业 ...\n开端\n最初呢我只是想有一个可以分享的平台，当时觉得微信公众号是最合适的，不需要我手动做多少，注册后就可以发文，所以下定决心后立马就开干了，当时将我所知道的一些 Windows 和软件相关的东西都做了个分享，后来随着个人折腾的东西越来越多，这里发的东西也就变多了一些，粉丝也基本上一直在涨。后来，因为开做生信，所以我搭建了个人博客，博客是几经周折，最终确定下来，近一些没有什么大的改动了，使用 hugo 框架+git 版本管理+Vercel 静态部署+Cloudflare DNS 解析，域名也确定在 yuanj.top ，甚至我现在的 Gmail 也是 yuanj.top@gmail.com 。\n\n这些大家都可以参考一下之前的文章 突然发现博客已经一年多了、如何搭建一个不用服务器的，简便的博客？。\n实际上，自从有博客之后，我的重心一直在博客上，因为它很自由，一切由我说了算，还记得公众号刚开始发的一些脚本和软件的文章，老是被删，而博客就不会有这些问题，博客上呢生信和随笔偏多，而公众号里都是一些博客上我觉得不错的文章，就把它迁移过来。\n转机\n公众号的阅读量和关注量上涨最快的是 使用 Linux 三年以来的感受、把私生活放进 Telegram 里 和 抛弃 WSL2 使用 scoop 搭建开发环境，那几个月阅读量一直在几万，而这几篇文章实际上也表明了我如今“折腾主阵地”的变化，以前就是玩玩 Windows 搞搞软件，如今似乎是变“成熟”了，对以前所纠结的东西已经不那么在乎，现在更在乎的是一直精神，比如我用 Arch ，虽然桌面依旧不那么理想，但是我爱上了 KISS 原则，喜欢系统与软件包具有同等地位的包管理器，乐于探索 Linux 更深处的奥秘，这也是这篇文章的主题——公众号文章内容的变化也是我的成长之路，可以说公众号和博客见证了我一步步的成长。\n如今\n如今，我已经看淡了很多东西，比如 Windows ，需要的时候那便用就是，为什么非要纠结是不是开源、是不是 Linux ？再如 Arch 桌面，桌面有瑕疵很正常，系统和软件都会有 bug ，何必在意那么多？只要它能够带给我想要的，那便是够了。如今我也爱上了一种极简主义精神，我希望很多事可以简简单单的，在学校的桌子我会定时收拾干净，将自己经常用的东西放在手边；手机和电脑里留下那些我需要的便可，这似乎也与 Arch 的理念不谋而合，我只要我需要的。但是我也没到走火入魔的地步，因为我很清楚，有些时候是无法真正做到极简的，所以 Windows 我也照用，即使微软喜欢给用户找不痛快，那又能怎么办？因为我需要用 Endnote 和 Office ，那么 Windows 也是必须的了，这跟 KISS 原则也并不冲突。如今想想当年因为一点点小小的问题就绕很大的弯子去解决，实在是让人贻笑大方。不过我还是坚持为生活做减法，更多的关注我所在意的东西，如今我闲暇时间基本都在 TG ，订阅了几个喜欢的博客和频道，偶尔看看 V2EX 的新帖子，那便是足够了，再者就是看看 YouTube 上关注的视频博主，感觉很惬意，电子阳痿都好了很多，算是在信息爆炸时代的一种挣扎。\n之前我一直在 RSS 订阅少数派的 martix 文章，后来取消了，起初我以为他们和我一样，都是热爱一些东西，所以乐于去折腾，但最终目的还是为了干活，为了提高数字生活质量，后来发现 ... 为什么会主动去创造需求？为什么连早起都要单独一个 APP ？总感觉有种折腾到最后不知道为什么而折腾的感觉，当然，个人看法而已~\n为什么\n其实很少有人问我为什么要写那么多东西，反而是我自己喜欢问我自己，这里写的所有文章都是我自己亲自写的，没有使用任何 AI ，而我也不会去加广告什么的，因为我觉得没必要，正如前文所述，内容的变化也是我的成长之路，而内容输出则是我进步的途径，我希望能将所学分享给更多的人，让他们少走我走过的弯路，我也希望可以让更多的人看到，我始终坚持着自己的执念，并未随着时间的脚步而消散。\n我来自甘肃边陲的一个小城镇，我其实并没有很大的追求，我只想坚持我所热爱的事物，并且希望我的坚持不会随着成长而逐渐逝去。正如我爱故乡的黄昏与夕阳，并且一直爱着。\n\n\n（题外话：西北虽然经济不行，但不至于喝不起水、骑驴上学 ...）\n今后\n今后我也会继续写，坚持着内容输出，毕竟，总会帮到别人的。\n正如苏轼所说：安得广厦千万间，大庇天下寒士俱欢颜！风雨不动安如山。",

          "description": "沉沉的睡了一觉，突然醒来了。女朋友躺在我的手臂上，躺太久，手臂被她压的有些麻了。我轻轻的把手臂从她的脖子下抽离开。想起来两个人刚刚战斗完，疲惫的睡了好久了。看着她熟睡中的可爱模样，忍不住在她的额头上的亲了一口，发现她的皮肤有点 Q 弹且温热。\n跟女朋友已经认识两年，发现我们有很多的地方都很相似，彼此变得越来越熟悉，我一个眼神，她一个动作，我们就能明白彼此在想什么。上个月刚在广场上求婚成功，她激动的哭了，我也激动的哭了，两年的爱情长跑总算是有了一个结果，下一步就是商量在哪领证，办婚礼，好在两个人达成了共识：不用太铺张，就两家人简简单单的吃个饭就行。\n我稍微从床上坐起来了，靠在枕头上，打开手机，奇怪，今天是周末，怎么企业微信多了这么多条信息，本来周末坚决不工作的原则，我点了手机上的叉号，那些消息被一键清除了。又有些后悔，从 app 里点开了，原来是 CTO 和同事们发来了一大段小作文。\n上周五经过昏天黑地的加班，终于把省外的一个大项目上线了，这时候公司的几百万钱款终于能到账。这次的项目工期紧张，又是完全没有开发过的领域，基本上每天工作都在十几个小时以上，每天下班公司都没人了，空荡荡的大厅，我把所有的灯一片一片的熄灭，最后锁上大门才放心离开。\n经过这次的项目上线，虽然拿不到很高额的奖金，但这次成功上线，这个部门主管位置基本上稳了。来这个公司好几年了，公司的氛围很好，和老员工们早已经打成一片，晚上一起吃加班餐，周末有时候也会聚聚。但是却一直做的是边边角角的工作，始终没有掌握公司的核心业务，我知道，在这个部门里，只有我一个人是新人，只有我资历最浅，领导始终有些不信任我吧。这次的项目上线，我终于能挤进来他们这个圈子里。\n很客气的跟领导回了一句：这都是领导指挥的好，我才能在你的英明部署下顺利上线呀，随即就把企微给关了。\n打开微信，发现妈妈给我发了好多的照片，他们已经开车到泉州了，上个月我买了一辆车子，本来想着平时代步用的，没想到爸爸却很喜欢我的 SUV,明着说帮我给车子热热身，实际上就是看上我的车了呗。\n本来他们已经买好了火车票，要去南方玩一下，爸爸说既然儿子有新车了，那么就跟妈妈一起开车过去吧。我们忙了一辈子了，基本上都在打工，现在该是去体验一下世界，勇闯生活了。\n妈妈给我发了好多在平潭拍的照片，看见大海，她就兴奋的不行了，像个小孩子一样：这里的大海怎么这么宽啊，比老家的湖宽了好多，这里的大海怎么这么蓝啊，真好看，就是海鲜吃不惯，没有老家的腊肉好吃。。。\n。。。\n嘟嘟嘟，嘟嘟嘟，嘟嘟嘟。\n沉沉的睡了一觉，突然醒来了。脑袋稍微有些疼，领导打电话来了：你们上周上的什么东西，赶紧给我解决掉！我仔细一想：原来周五的上线出了好多 bug 。\n艰难的起床，脚不小心碰到了地上的酒瓶，在地上翻滚，旋转，传递给下一个酒瓶，一个接一个，发出哐哐哐的声音。这一周的工作压力特别大，每天都靠着酒精才能勉强睡几个小时。\n把桌子上点的外卖盒子都推到一边，键盘于是从垃圾堆里冒出头了，打开电脑，微信弹出来好多爸妈的消息：我们天天厂里上班这么累，你到底什么时候才能找一个女朋友，结婚生子。这么大人了，还让我们操心?\n哒哒哒哒哒，我开始工作了。。。\n灵感来自于自穆赫兰道，\n写在三十岁生日来临之际。",

          "description": "最近开源了个小项目 CrossPaste，实现跨设备的粘贴板应用，当前支持 Mac/Windows/Linux （移动端在开发中）。\n开发这个项目主要目的是为了帮助多平台开发、设计人员（其实是我自己）解决多个设备间需要频繁同步数据的问题，现有的工具往往需要发送 -> 接收 -> 保存 -> 拷贝 -> 粘贴使用，效率低下，也严重打断工作心流。\nCrossPaste 的核心目标：在任意设备间复制粘贴，就像在同一台设备上操作一样自然流畅。\n当然单机的粘贴板管理功能也都支持\n支持多种粘贴板类型（文本、html 富文本、链接、图片、文件（文件夹））\n支持历史搜索，自动粘贴（返回上一个获取焦点的软件自动粘贴）\n支持收藏粘贴板\n支持纯快捷键操作\n为什么要开源项目，考虑到了一些其他原因\nCrossPaste 使用 compose-multiplatform 技术实现一套代码构建跨平台应用，compose-multiplatform 社区迭代还是蛮快的，但是国内资料相对还比较少，我这个项目就当是抛砖了\n类似的项目也有很多，闭门造车可能只能解决自己的问题，我希望更多人参与进来（反馈意见、请求新功能、贡献代码都欢迎），解决大家的问题\n安全原因，粘贴板记录是一个非常隐私敏感的问题，我想开源可以提高透明度，让大家更加放心使用（也可以自行构建）\n开源地址： https://github.com/CrossPaste/crosspaste-desktop\n官网： https://crosspaste.com\n下载页面： https://crosspaste.com/download\n也可以到 GitHub release 页面下载： https://github.com/CrossPaste/crosspaste-desktop/releases\n如果觉得项目不错欢迎点个 star\n另外叠个甲，我并没有购买微软的代码签名证书（这类证书一般需要每年 4-5k ，毕竟当前状态是为爱发电，还不会考虑去买。但是如果有富哥愿意 Github sponsor ，我会将收入用来购买证书），所以在 win 启动应用可能会弹出系统或者杀毒软件告警，这是正常现象。\n但是有个好消息是 CrossPaste 上架了 Microsoft Store ，可以直接在商店下载安装，微软帮忙签名就没有这些困扰了。",

Details...\n点击 Details...，提示：\nCannot Get Mail\nThe connection to the server failed\n然而邮箱应用里的另一个基本不使用的多年前注册的账号没问题。\n立即查看 iCloud Status ，全绿。\n使用网页版 iCloud 查看，登陆后，所有功能正常，除了邮件。点击邮件图标，提示:\nUnable to Open iCloud Mail\niCloud Mail cannot be loaded at this time.\n登录 AppleID 网页后，账号一切正常，查看邮件地址，A@xxx.com 和 B@icloud.com 都赫然在列。\n无奈联系苹果客服，首先通过 iMessage 联系，来的是个心不在焉的客服（英语），举几个例子：\n我提供了 iPhone 上的截图，对方问我 Mac 的问题\n我说了尝试了网页登录，且登录正常，还提供了截图，对方问，你尝试网页办 iCloud 了么\n要求转交给 senior 级别人员，并提供了电话。不知道此人怎么记录的电话，收到了邮件（ A@xxx.com 收到的），提示工作人员尝试联系我，然而手机完全没动静。\n换了电话之后，终于在次日接到了电话，然而电话里的工作人员只是进行了常规排查，比如重新登录什么的。最后补充了一张截图（初次我提交了多张截图都用上了），复现了问题，提交了 log ，同时工作人员记录了时间方便相关同事定位，说是会转给工程师。\n现在两天过去了，邮箱依然用不了……\n搜了一圈，也没查到谁有类似的问题……",

          "description": "之前的一些讨论\nWindows11 远程桌面的这个用户名和密码到底是什么\nWindows10 更改 Microsoft 账户密码后远程桌面密码不变\n目的\n起因是当我改了一次微软账号的密码后，发现 rdp 还是能用之前的账号密码登录，反而用新的密码无法登录。\n于是就开始搜集资料并进行本地验证。\n一番验证后，了解了微软账号(Microsoft Account)和本地帐号(Local Account)的区别。做一些整理后发出来让大家以后遇到类似情况时有个参考。\n欢迎大家讨论纠错。\n账号\n当首次登录 windows 时，系统会让你登录微软账号，也就是经典的这个页面。\n\n此时当成功登录微软账号后，系统会为这个微软账号创建一个本地账号，通常账号名是邮箱前缀。\n但如果 windows 上已有一个相同前缀的本地账号，比如先使用\"abc@outlook.com\"登录，生成了本地账号\"abc\"，又使用\"abc@icloud.com\"登录，那么系统则会为创建的本地账号名添加随机后缀。例如第二个本地账号为\"abc_2qoabc\"。\n使用 win + r 运行 netplwiz 会进入\"用户账户\"页面，双击用户名，即可看到本机用户的用户名和全名。\n\n密码\n需要知道的是，与 windows 有关的密码有三种。\n微软账号(Microsoft Account)的密码\n本地账号(Local Account)的密码\nPIN\nPIN 是否能算密码还有待商榷。至少应该不会有人用 PIN 去尝试登录远程桌面。PIN 只存在 windows 本地，用于本机登录使用，不会与任何服务器发生交流。\n当我们初次使用微软账号登录 windows 时，本地帐号(Local Account)的密码会同步成微软账号(Microsoft Account)的密码。\n但是当我们使用网页修改微软账号(Microsoft Account)的密码后，新的密码并不会同步到本地账号上(Local Account)。而使用 rdp 服务不需要与微软服务器进行对话, 只需要客户端与目的计算机对话, 所以仍能使用旧密码登录远程桌面。要想改变登录远程桌面的密码，就只能手动触发同步密码的流程。\n目前我找到的是在锁屏界面点击\"忘掉了 pin\"，重新登陆下微软账号即可，并不需要重设 PIN 。只需要登录账号，然后取消操作就行。\n我看到网上说\"将微软账号转成本地账号\"或是\"退出微软账号\"，之后重新登录微软账号也可以触发同步流程。但是在 windows 11 上我没有找到这些操作的按钮，也比较担心这些操作可能带来的副作用，就没有尝试了。\n应用登录\n登录这一流程分应用，这里用的是两个常用的应用，一个是 windows 上的\"远程桌面\"，另一个是 ios 上的\"RD Client\"。\n以微软账号为abc@outlook.com，密码是password来举例。\n远程桌面\n\n在\"远程桌面\"中，可以使用的用户名是：\nabc@outlook.com\noutlook.com\\abc\nabc\nMicrosoftAccount\\abc\nMicrosoftAccount\\abc@outlook.com\n并且这 5 种方式在被其他客户端挤掉线后都会以 5. MicrosoftAccount\\abc@outlook.com 的方式呈现用户名。\n这些账号中前两种符合微软 RDP 的用户名要求用户 @域或域\\用户。第三种或许是因为他是本地用户？第 4 、5 种是\"远程桌面\"自动帮忙解析了MicrosoftAccount？\nRD Client\n\n在 RD Client 中，能用的用户名有图片中这三种，也就是前一小节中第 1 到 3 种用户名格式。\n权限\n\n使用 win+r 运行 gpedit.msc, 即可打开\"本地组策略编辑器\", 在\"计算机配置\"->\"Windows 设置\"->\"安全设置\"->\"本地策略\"->\"用户权限分配\"->\"允许通过远程桌面服务登录\"中可以看到被允许远程登录计算机的组(group).\n\n使用 win+x 点击\"计算机管理\"->\"系统工具\"->\"本地用户和组\"->\"组\", 双击组即可看到这个组里有哪些用户了.",

          "description": "各位，\n我想使用市面上的小主机(主板尺寸 120*120 左右)配合 sfx 电源组一台 nas ，用于替代当前标准 msata 机箱的 nas 。机械硬盘数量当前为 8 个，最多应该不会超过 12 个。\n由于一般小主机扩展都非常有限。nvme 一般只有一个，至多 2 个。sata 一般没戏。考虑我至少要有 1 个拿来用于 ssd 系统盘。我试图寻找 nvme 转多 sata 的产品，只找到了 3 个解决方法：\n1.nvme 转 sata ，asm 芯片的，最多 5 口。\n2.nvme 转 mini sas ，这样能到 8 口。\n3.nvme 转 pcie 槽，再转 sata ，这样能到 16 口甚至更多，但体积方面就比较难崩了。\n请问还有其他解决方法么？\n\n谢谢",

          "description": "目前的工作内容需要开发一个类似 GeoGebra 的可视化输入函数绘图工具，目标用户是非专业人员，需要支持完全通过鼠标操作进行可视化输入。公式可以通过 LaTeX 渲染，但是不能让用户感知到有 LaTeX 的存在。公式有可能会复杂一点，比如下面这样：\ny=\\frac{2\\tan\\left(x\\right)}{\\log_{2}{\\left|\\sqrt[3]{3x}\\right|}}\n\n其实已经做了一部分了，基于 Web 前端开发，用了 MathQuill 库作为 LaTeX 表达式的渲染和可视化编辑；\n另一方面通过 JS 函数绘图的方法也搞定了，没有使用现成的库，但是tan(x)这种存在间断点的函数也是能正确绘制的；\n目前最大的问题还是不知道怎么把用户通过 MathQuill 的库自定义输入的 LaTeX 表达式编译成 JS 函数。比如上面的tan(x)，通过软键盘的方式输入过后，实际得到的 LaTeX 字符串是：\n\\tan\\left(x\\right)\n\n又或者说进一步复杂点的对数函数，软键盘的方式输入（调用 MathQuill 的实例将当前的 LaTeX 表达式设置为\\log_{2}{x}）过后再次编辑，把 x 改成 x+1 ，表达式就会变成下面这样：\n\\log_2x+1\n\n非常头疼。\n本身我没有学过计算机专业课，不过大概知道这一块算是编译原理需要解决的内容，我在做的东西应该是一个基于 LaTeX 语法的 JS 表达式引擎，但光是知道这些还是不太够。\n目前的成果是，找到了一款名叫 filtrex 的 npm 库，他是基于另一个叫做 jison 的库提供了基础的 JS 表达式引擎功能，而这个 jison 是 Bison 的 JS 版本，Bison 则是一款专业的语法分析工具。\n通过 GPT-4o 添加了一些我设定的语法规则，实际用起来发现只能做到正确解析我预设的函数，真正的用户输入和 MathQuill 的输出千变万化，无法一一穷举。\n比如我可以做到解析(x)^{2},但是把(x)编辑成(x+1)过后，整个式子会变成(x+1)^2，jison 提示“Expecting 'LBRACE', got 'NUMBER'”，又无法解析了。更不要说\\log_2x+1这种看起来就没法解析的 LaTeX 了。\n各位 V 友有什么好的建议吗？是不是我走的方向有点错误，不应该从直接解析 LaTeX 入手？还是说这个问题的复杂程度其实是我无法胜任的应该尽量改变需求？",

          "description": "吃了太多的外卖了，这个周末终于想自己做点吃的了。外卖吃过来吃过去就那么几家，就算再好吃的东西，每次都点，每天都吃，总会吃腻的。而且，点外卖又很贵，重油重盐的，吃着很香，但每次吃完都很口渴。\n早上在盒马买了一些菜，最近挺喜欢逛盒马的，东西很多，很齐全，什么吃的零食，各种生鲜一应俱全了，不仅喜欢逛实体店，而且也总在他们家点外卖。干净整洁，而且服务态度很好，东西又很齐全，这谁能拒绝呢？\n今天买了一些五花肉，买了一些猪肚，买了一些辣椒，买了一些蒜苗，花了 50 块钱。中午做了一个炒五花肉，晚上做了个炒猪肚。\n外卖到了后，先把五花肉和辣椒用清水洗了一下，把五花肉切成片状，越薄越好，把锅先涮了一下，烧热它，再倒进去一点点花生油，让油出现沸腾的状态，就可以把五花肉下到锅里煸炒了，煸炒时间可以稍微长一点，把五花肉的油脂给逼出去，一直到肉表面呈现微微金黄色，稍微有一些卷的时候，就继续往锅里放一勺豆瓣酱，上色均匀。\n这时候锅里面已经都是油了，不断地冒着泡泡，我习惯将炼出的油倒掉一部分，太油腻的话身体吃了不舒服，这时候再放入切成段的蒜苗，稍微炒两下就可以出锅了。\n20 块钱的五花肉，差不多有一斤，在厨房忙忙活活的弄了一上午，开开心心的出锅，摆盘，自己做的菜就是香，吹着空调，一边喝着小酒，一边吃着菜，很自在，最后一整个光盘。\n不过晚上的猪肚就成了失败品，由于是第一次做猪肚，经验有些不足，再加上猪肚没有切的很薄，导致嚼不烂，一整盘菜最后就浪费了。\n其实我挺喜欢做饭的，自己挑选食材，自己清洗食材，自己烹饪出来，虽然我的厨艺不是很好，但总觉得自己做的特别的香，记得在之前公司的时候，经常去领导家玩，那个领导自己买一些菜，我有时候也会带一些菜，他租的房子很大，厨房和客厅都很大，很适合做饭，然后把一个小组里的人都叫过去，刚开始有个同事很会做饭，但后面就离职了，我平时在家里就很少做的，记得有一次我清蒸了一条鲈鱼，被我妈一顿嫌弃，说是太淡了，我说你年纪大了，吃淡一点的好，她说不行不行，得去重加工一下。自此，就基本没再家里做个饭了。\n但是那个同事离职之后，我就临危受命，担任了厨师的角色，没想到效果却意外的好，拿手的有两道菜，一个是红烧鸡块，一个是炒五花肉，每次做这两道菜，每次都被不同的人夸赞。吃完之后，几个人就在家里吃西瓜，组队玩游戏，很多个周末都是这样度过的。\n来上海后，一直是租房子的状态，跌跌撞撞的换了好几次房子，有时候会有厨房，有时候没有。上一家租的房子，就是一个原始的大主卧，没有做饭的地方，在那里住了三年了，基本上都是在外面吃或者是点外卖。\n住了太久了，对那个小区很熟悉，想走又不想走，不想走是因为对那些太熟悉了，吃喝玩乐，闭着眼睛都能找到，想走也是因为太熟悉了，这毕竟不是自己买的房子，很熟悉有什么用呢，得去别的地方看一下，了解一下，不是老是困在这个熟悉圈里。\n现在找的这个房子是个老破小，天天要爬楼梯到 6 楼，周围也是有点脏乱差，但是在找的过程中，我却对这个房子的厨房一见钟情，可以说，就是因为这个厨房，我才选择租这个房子的。厨房不大，正对门就是原始的天然气灶台，左边是两个洗菜池，右边是一个很长的台面，抬头是三四个大壁橱，台面下是各种抽屉和柜子，可以说是麻雀虽小五脏俱全。最最重要的是，这个厨房完全属于我一个人。我是很不习惯和别人一起共用厨房，共用卫生间的。搬进来的第一天，我就在幻想着以后在这个厨房里，会做出什么惊天美味，我发现我还是挺爱幻想的。\n但实际的结果是，即使有这么方便的一个厨房，我好像也很少做饭，说自己很忙，没时间，其实都是借口。\n直到上一次食物中毒后，我才又重新开始审视这个厨房，现在早上和晚上都是自己开始做，周末就买点菜，整点花里胡哨的。",

Droppable\n这个产品是专门为大文件共享（最高可达 2TB ）设计的 macOS 原生应用程序，界面设计真好看。能快速、高效地发送文件。这个应用的定位是摄影师、摄像师等创意工作者，他们经常需要发送大文件，这是他们日常工作的一部分。定价$9.99 买断制。\n\n2. Dropset: Gym tracker\n一个设计的很好看的健身记录 APP ，黑白风确实很好看，简洁舒服，很小众了。\n\n3. CheckPlug\n作者@ybhrdwj抓取了 195 个国家/地区的电压数据，开发了这个网站，可以告诉你下次旅行需要哪种旅行电源插头，具体开发过程可以看作者的这个推文，使用 NextJS + Tailwind ，交互非常简单。灵感来自 WhatPlug.info 这个网站，优化了交互和体验，盈利方式是添加了 Amazon Affiliate ，推荐用户购买获得佣金。\n\n4. History Timeline\n这个网站可以用 AI 快速创建历史事件的自定义时间线。帮助整理和展示历史事件的发展过程。我测试了一下埃隆•马斯克（ Elon Musk ）历史时间表和传记，原理估计很简单，但是如果能用图表展示出来，可视化会体验不错，应该还可以做一些其他后续的操作，比如编辑/切换视图排列方式，导出图片，导出 PPT 等等，可以做增值服务。想法很不错。\n\n5. Focused\nFocused 是一款简洁无干扰的 macOS 写作 APP ，有一个非常有趣的功能叫做 Zen Mode ，它让你可以通过播放 8 首平静的自然配乐来过滤掉生活中的干扰，也就是自带白噪音功能。\n\n6.Diagramly…",

          "description": "使用 go 开发项目多年，了解和使用过不少 go 框架，例如 web 框架有 gin 、echo 、fiber 、iris 、beego 等，微服务框架有 grpc 、go-micro 、kratos 、go-zero 等，无论是 web 框架或微服务框架，当深入了解使用一个框架之后，同类的框架都比较容易上手使用。\n开发一个完整后端服务通常不止只有框架代码，还有 API 设计、数据库、测试、文档、配置、部署和监控等等，如果经常使用 gin 开发 web 服务都知道，由于 gin 过于轻量简洁，从 0 开始搭建一个完整的 web 后端服务还是过于麻烦，需要像搭积木一样拼接成完整的后端服务，达不到预想的一键创建一整套完整的后端服务代码。而使用微服务框架可以创建一整套目录结构代码，还有包含了配置、api 文档、部署和监控等。而在根据多种类型数据的表生成 CRUD api 方面没怎么支持(这不是微服务框架需要考虑的，毕竟使用什么数据库和 orm 由使用者决定)。如果开发一个业务相对简单的 web 服务，通常又不会使用微服务框架。\n我实现一个从项目层级的开发框架目的是能够把以往开发项目经验固化下来，这对于提升个人开发技术水平和解决问题能力具有极大的帮助，从项目层面思考和设计架构，并将其经验应用于其他项目开发中，方便自己和也方便团队开发，在团队协作中使用统一的开发框架可以提高代码的一致性和可维护性，如果团队成员对现有框架有不同的意见和建议，则可能导致沟通成本上升。\n注：这里的项目层级的开发框架是指一键创建包含了 web 或 grpc 框架、常用中间件或拦截器、API 、配置、orm 、测试、文档、部署和监控等等，大多情况只需关心编写业务逻辑代码。理论上从项目层级看，越往项目层设计的开发框架，可以做到自动化会越高，而 web 框架或微服务框架从框架层级设计，自动化程度没那么高，当然可以在框架层级基础上转换到项目层级设计。\n实现的在项目层级的 go 开发框架 sponge 没有从 0 开始，而是选择在 gin 和 grpc 两个基础上设计，因为这两个框架都是比较轻量级，可以定制化程度更高。\nsponge 主要特点：\n内置了丰富的生成代码和合并代码功能，自动化程度更高，减少了大量原本需要手动编写的代码，只需专注于编写业务逻辑代码。\n支持基于 mysql 、mongodb 、postgresql 、tidb 、sqlite 表来生成 CRUD 代码。\n支持在 UI 界面上生成代码，更简单易用。\n支持丰富的 gin 中间件、grpc 拦截器，同时有很好的可扩展性。\n包含丰富的常用的组件，开箱即用。\n⓵基于 sql 创建 web 服务 (gin, gorm 或 mongo)\n⓶基于 sql 创建 grpc 服务 (grpc, gorm 或 mongo)\n⓷基于 protobuf 创建 web 服务 (gin)\n⓸基于 protobuf 创建 grpc 服务 (grpc)\n⓹基于 protobuf 创建 grpc 网关服务 (gin)\n⓺基于 protobuf 创建 grpc+http 服务(gin, grpc)\nGitHub 地址： https://github.com/zhufuyi/sponge\n优秀的开发框架或脚手架有很多，选择适合自己或团队来解决实际问题就是好的选择。",

          "description": "难得小朋友去度暑假了，周末在家独享片刻安宁。想写一些文字，记录所思所想。本来一有空就想写写画画，做一些节录，然而很担心不够深刻，几年后回头看，笑掉大牙，故成文稀少。很多想法都一直在脑子里过了很多遍，也不成文字。\n1 、每个人的性格从小时候起都已初见端倪，我的故事是这样的：大概在我 5-6 岁的样子，有年夏天姐姐的腿骨折了。行动不是特别方便，去哪儿都是爸背着。有天晚上从外婆家回来，天色已晚，我爸背着姐姐、带着我一起回家。由于比较晚我很困，不想走路，按平时爸爸肯定背我，姐姐走路跟着，但是今天姐姐腿脚不方便，只能让我走路跟着。我一万个不愿意，一路大哭，慢吞吞地跟在后面，眼见他们越走越远，我更是大哭不止。爸爸把姐姐送回家，回头来接我。看见我爸的那一刻，我整个人都不依不挠心想：\"你咋才来呀，我都走这么远了, 不行,你必须回去从起点开始背我.\"当然最后的结局肯定是暴打一顿。反复的事情应该发生了好几次，每次揍完依旧这样，直到姐姐的腿痊愈。我想那或许是最初的意难平。\n2 、后面的人生轨迹让我渐渐地收敛，主要的原因是没有那么多\"恃宠而骄\"的机会。后面的路上也有很多意难平的经历，主要表现在==我本可以做到的==的懊悔上。\n3 、三年级以前我写字比较慢，耽误了很多玩耍的时间。自从看见初一的姐姐使用行书写字，我反复打开了新世界大门，语文作业 1/3 的时间就完成了。后果却是我写的字没人认得出，全班写字最差的人。从此语文就是我最大的苦恼。也尝试过好好练字。记忆最深的是，有一年除夕的晚上大冬天还在练字，但姐姐转头就向妈妈告状，\"弟弟又开始乱涂乱写了\"，这些经历给我了巨大的习得性无助。我十分想把字写好，也很努力练习，从三年级到高一，但我都是全班写字最差的，语文老师曾经把我的练习册丢在地上踩了几脚，太差了。那种深深的无助感一直刻在我的心理。直到高二的春节，我去一个亲戚家，他是医生，写的处方非常好看楷书，我就在他的桌子旁边无聊开始模仿他的字。他得空看了我的字说“你控笔可以，但是结构不好，你先按照语文书上的字体结构练练楷体字，慢慢写”。顺便给我说，你的字哪个部分为什么不好，结构要和谐与对称什么的。回去之后我慢慢练，一个春节都在家里练字，感觉每一篇都是我写过的最好的一篇字，那种成就感让我废寝忘食。终于回学校后给了老师和同学巨大的震撼，写字我终于入门了。半年后暑假，突然有一天在家练字，写一篇后，我深深的感叹，我怎么没早发现这些规律，==我本早可以做到的，怎么现在才有点感觉==，要是那样就不会又那么多习得性无助和挫败感。\n4 、大三的暑假，我留在了学校参加 9 月份的大学生电子竞赛赛前培训。计科院与物理学院一起组队参与这次比赛。2 个月的赛培时间学到很多电子和硬件相关的东西，也结识了很多朋友。我们对被院长寄于厚望，因为在模拟赛的时候，我的软件编码能力被让大家眼前一亮。所以我们团队都是奔着一等奖去的。9 月正式比赛的题目是：差分模拟器(好像是)，一共有 3 个小功能。3 天时间，在封闭环境下完成。因为要冲击一等奖，所以我们打算搞完最后一个功能再开始联调测试。很可惜功能完成后，软硬件结合调试的时候，一个功能都没完成。3 个月的时间，空手而归。 平复心情后，我回头看我们的工程。发现只是第一个小功能因为一个小 bug 导致整个项目识别，我那个懊悔。我们本可以拿奖的，如果我的策略没有那么激进，要冲一等奖，我们是稳稳可以拿奖的。==本可以做到的，辜负了大家期望==。\n5 、大学里还有好多本可以做到的事情，因为没有勇气，不敢尝试。比如：去参加软件设计大赛、比如:和宿舍同学多玩一些游戏、比如：和女生大胆地自行车比赛；工作以后也有。有一个关于勇敢尝试的 h 段子记忆深刻：如果你见到漂亮的女生，勇敢地上去就亲，结果嘛有两种：1 、啪(打脸)； 2 、啪啪啪；当然这些都是简单粗暴地总结，我后面逐渐有点总结是：在风险可控的范围里，勇敢尝试。，这样至少不会有==我本可以的==最后连尝试都没发生的遗憾\n6 、这样的总结我觉得可能还不够，意难平或者说难以释怀的避免办法还不够。直到最近我在工作上给大家打绩效、谈奖金后，我终于得出结论。背景是这样的：整个一年大家都比较累，压力大，我给大家一直都是批评的声音，谈绩效的时候大家都有怨言。直到给到大家超出预期的奖金，那些所有的意难平、怨言全部消失。我的结论是：人们都活在预期里，幸福只有预期相关。 \n7 、管理好风险和预期下，勇敢尝试。就不会意难平。",

          "description": "目前这个节点是大三同学的暑假，紧接着到来的就是秋招。目前有一疑惑，特来向各位前辈讨教：\n对于应届生的实习经历，企业在校招中，更看重的是有企业的实习经历，还是有实际的研发能力呢？\n对于校招与社招，企业分别有怎样的期待呢？对于实际研发已经有足够经验，入职可以直接上手开发的应届生，走校招还会比社招更加有优势吗？如果走社招，在薪资等方面会不会更有优势？\n问题背景：\n我的朋友计算机专业大三，之前已有拿得出手的技术类竞赛奖项，技术能力和学习能力都很不错。上学期加入了实验室的一个横向项目，项目是企业的实际研发需求，可以理解为外包给了实验室；在实验室有人带有人指导，本人也觉得确实学到了很多之前接触不到的东西，对于项目相关技术的理解也是渐入佳境的状态。\n目前正面临一个选择，究竟是留在实验室继续项目，还是在暑假/下学期初去企业实习？留在实验室继续项目对于技术能力肯定是还能继续有较大长进的，但是就肯定没有时间实习；去企业实习的话，无疑简历上会更加丰富，但是在企业实习生应该一般很难真正接触研发的核心，甚至不一定能有研发的机会，很多都是打杂性质的工作？如果去实习几个月，反而可能浪费真正提升技术的机会。\n所以想问问各位前辈，企业更加看重实习经历这个经历本身呢，还是更加注重实际技术能力呢？我朋友这种情况应该如何选择呢？\n此外跟朋友聊天的时候，朋友还给出了一个有意思的观点，他说对于真正有技术实力的，走校招可能反而会吃亏。他自己就是技术实力很强的，在杭州某大厂就职；去年校招入职后就直接上手研发，很快的时间就开始负责有难度有深度的技术攻坚了，他们主管原话说是从来没敢让应届生负责过这个事情。但是今年他却很难受，原因是承担了明显不一样的压力，明显不一样的工作强度，但是薪水一批进去的都是一样的，即使他们主管帮他写申请破格处理都没用，原因就是应届生年限没熬出来。所以我们讨论时，说他当时如果走社招，可能反而会好一些；但是也有可能根本没人要这样的简历。\n特地也一起提出来，想听听大家的想法，对于能力很强的应届生，去走社招，企业会是如何看待的呢？",

          "description": "最近上海的天似乎是裂开了，雨一阵一阵的下，不是那种缠缠绵绵的细雨，是中雨，大雨，狂风暴雨。\n晴天，在天快黑的时候，天空会出现一大片的克莱因蓝，整个天际都被它笼罩着，像披了一层薄薄的纱，又像是裹了一层厚厚的布。这层蓝色掉落凡间，成为了精美的工艺品。有时候调色盘打翻了，会出现粉红的晚霞，一大片一大片的，天空也有少女心，它的娇羞展露无疑。随着夜幕完全降临，黑暗笼罩着一切，这蓝色才依依不舍的离开。\n有句歌词叫做，爱就像蓝天白云，晴空万里，忽然暴风雨，但是今天这场雨蓄谋已久。\n先是乌云。抬头不见蔚蓝的天空，只有大片大片的乌云，乌云们比较沉默，它们只是成团成团的聚在一起，走在跨铁路的天桥上，脚下的火车刚刚驶出车站，正在提速，远处的高楼巍峨的矗立在那里，但乌云毫无畏惧，不断地吸收，不断地膨胀自己，黑云压城城欲摧，当你凝视乌云的时候，乌云也在凝视你，大有吞噬一切的决心。\n然后是闪电。似乎是乌云的铺垫已经足够，是时候来点猛的了，一道闪电划破长空，把乌云笼罩的天空撕开了口子， 闪电是粉红色的，它华丽，它迅猛，它快捷，等你反应过来的时候，它已经完成了它的出场秀，直接隐遁起来。它是一条漂亮且暴躁的蛟龙，谁都别想阻拦它的脚步，房屋阻拦它，房屋损毁，碰到人阻拦，人首分离，它的眼里只有毁灭，毁灭，毁灭。这么强悍的闪电只有一个敌人，避雷针。避雷针太了解它了，把能量都吸走，把力量都卸去，还能奈我何？也许是多次吃过这个亏，闪电们不再单打独斗，而是群体出击，一道又一道的闪电接踵而至，依次划破天空，他们准备释放些什么。\n接着是打雷。视觉上的刺激还不够，还有最后一道铺垫，闪电蛟龙离开之后，立刻来了一道擂鼓助威。先是剧烈的轰的一下，整个城区都石破天惊，一下子把人们的注意力都吸走，然后是急促的咚咚咚咚咚的擂鼓，这鼓声沉闷而又有力量，所有听到这鼓声的人精神为之一振。这边的鼓声渐渐变小，直到消失，人们终于可以叹口气，休息一下了，突然又从另外一个方向再次来一道雷声，再次震撼人的听觉，摧毁人的神经。在一遍又一遍的雷声过后，人们心里的防线终于彻底崩塌：快点下雨吧，快点下雨吧，这种听觉实在让人备受折磨。\n冲锋的号角已经吹起，无数颗雨滴化身成为千军万马，哗啦啦直接从刚才闪电撕开的口子降落而下，它们犹如一股洪流，锐不可挡，一鼓作气，直接从万里高空直冲而下，像是铁板一块，坚不可摧，快要降落到地面的时候，却又改变阵型，各自有各自明确的分工。有的雨滴冲向高楼，有的雨滴冲向人群。有些雨滴在高楼坚硬的外表下猛烈的撞击了一下，蹦出一朵美丽的花，然后又继续向下游走，有些雨专挑路上落单的行人下手，把头发打湿，把衣服打湿，嘲笑着他们在雨中的窘迫，只有那些认真打伞，全副武装的人，它们才无可奈何。\n我坐在窗边，看着窗外滂沱大雨，忍不住的在发呆。作为一个小沪漂，以前很不喜欢宅在家里，呆在这个小空间里，觉得压抑，难受，周末总是会给自己找个理由多出去走走，现在年纪大了，什么都反着来了，越来越喜欢待在家里了，尤其是这种大风大雨的时候，越发的觉得心里很安心，很平静。\n写在一个下暴雨的傍晚。",

          "description": "我有一笔房贷，一共是 127 万元，是 2020 年 3 月份开始贷款的，选的等额本金，30 年。（后续的公积金部分都没算，不打算提前还公积金的 1700 元）当时每个月商贷还 7500 元，随着贷款利率的调整，也就是 LPR 的调整，目前 2024 年 7 月份，每个月只还 6400 元。我之前一共贷款 127 万元，在 2022 年 5 月的时候提前还款了 20 万元，当时选的减年限，所以还款到 2041 年就结束。目前银行的贷款利率是 3.95%。我现在可以去借一个 2.95%的消费贷，来提前还我的房贷贷款 50 万元吗？这样做划算吗？\n大概算了下 3 年的消费贷的话。3 年需要还 32000 元。每个月要还 14000 左右，加上房贷的话，每个月就是 20500 元\n从今年 4 月份开始我发现我的房贷本金还 3200 ，利息还 3200 左右。所以相当于现在我每个月开始本金比利息还的更多了。\n这笔经济账我已经算不清楚了。我本身的倾向就有提前还款的趋势，但是又在犹豫国家大放水的问题。\n注：不用考虑主要工作风险问题，目前我没有做投资的打算，因为最近用了一笔比较大的开销，目前我手上 0 存款。不用考虑每个月我是否还不上的问题。",

          "description": "说个很残酷的事，就是软件行业劳动力过剩还在加剧。这个趋势要持续到什么时候呢，从两个角度观察：\n首先是对风口的迷信。AI 是现在的风口，你们觉得它好用吗，有人用吗？就算有人用，但这么高的成本，有望盈利吗？就算有望盈利，这点钱能撑到那时候吗？就算能撑到那时候，面对新入局竞争者能保持优势吗？难道拿提示词申请专利？\n我想说的是，未来软件风口行业可能会非常不稳定，市场小，企业存活期短，这是大形势决定的。\n其次是创业者越来越多的从自建研发部门转为找外包公司做。我没有确切数字，只是所见所感。很多小平台没什么技术门槛，创业者更关注的是业务模式可行性，花小几万块，先把服务上线看看，做不下去损失也不大。所以别瞧不起外包，外包市场依然有持续的增长空间。只不过互联网创业不再如以前那样明显带来用人需求了。\n综上所述，软件业的劳动力过剩还会加剧，还会继续出清。哪些人呢？一是被培训机构忽悠进来的，报班前告诉你薪水过万，学完出来结果不但就业率低，大部分收入都达不到个税起征点。人家 985211 科班出身的，就业率都那个吊样，你指望啥呢？二是大厂拧螺丝的，你真以为几万的月薪全靠你的本事？你一个月薪水够人家外包公司上线一个新平台，你能做啥，写三条 SQL ？一旦大厂裁掉这些拧螺丝的，他们几乎只能离开行业。\n最后，我没有任何建设性意见。如今提建设性意见容易审核不通过。",

          "description": "据台湾“中时新闻网”7月23日报道，近几年苹果公司执行“去风险”与分散供应链的策略，将订单转向印度，但实际操作下来显然并不顺利。去年印度厂组装iPhone 15不顺遭到退货，还被迫大幅降价，苹果公司首席执行官库克本人还前往中国大陆重新整顿供应链。经此教训，今年苹果已将部分产能转回中国大陆代工厂，比亚迪、立讯精密等大厂已加入iPhone 16供应链，成为苹果最新的代工伙伴。\n\r\n\r\n报道称，富士康在印度斯里佩伦布杜尔的生产基地从2023年8月开始着手生产iPhone 15系列苹果手机，目标是缩短印度与中国大陆的出货时间差，实现两地供应链同步。彭博社报道指出，富士康印度厂紧随中国大陆厂之后，仅以数周之差向全球市场供应iPhone 15系列手机，两地生产周期完成紧密接轨，印度甚至因此扬言未来5年内产值要增加5倍。\n\r\n\r\n不过实际上印度厂iPhone 15代工数量占比虽然只有一成，但问题仍然不少：印度厂需要依赖从中国大陆进口大量零部件，品质与效率都受到影响；印度厂iPhone代工的良率（仅五成左右）和卫生管理（大肠杆菌超标）仍存在问题。这两方面的问题导致产品在输往欧洲与中国大陆两个市场时都造成困扰，影响了市场销售量，苹果也因此决定以降价促销因应。库克访华时除了前往苹果零售门店与消费者互动外，还与比亚迪、立讯精密等企业会面，表示要加强与中国大陆企业合作。\n\r\n\r\n报道称，最近大陆一名知名智能手机博主在社交平台上指出，即将推出的iPhone 16系列依旧主要在中国大陆组装，其中部分高阶的旗舰机型还从富士康转到比亚迪，这也证明大陆在智能手机的代工水准方面仍居于领先地位，要立即转到印度等其他国家并没有那么容易。\n\r\n\r\n在供应链方面，大陆许多零件供应商都非常希望加入苹果供应链，不仅利润丰厚，其品质还能在业界获得肯定，能因此获得更多议价权。今年苹果公布的供应商名单中，又有10家在大陆企业加入苹果供应链，这显示虽然苹果将部分代工组装移往印度，但是却持续在中国增加供应商，库克去年访华期间与比亚迪、立讯精密、蓝思科技等企业的高管会面，证明苹果将扩大培养中国大陆的供应商。\n\r\n\r\niPhone16大部分代工回流至中国大陆后，富士康为此大举招收新员工，许多零配件也转回向大陆供应链采购，部分原本计划将工厂移至印度的供应链厂商开始出现动摇，暂时改采观望态度。\n\r\n\r\n来源：参考消息、中国经济网",

          "description": "影片根据大卫·劳埃德与阿兰·摩尔创作的同名1988年DC漫画改编的反乌托邦电影，背景设定在一个架空的未来——受到新法西斯主义统治的伦敦，讲述了一个戴着盖伊·福克斯面具的自由斗士反抗新法西斯主义极权政府的故事。\n\r\n\r\n影片设定在一个极权主义政府控制下的英国，独裁者苏特勒通过恐怖和宣传手段维持统治。而在14年前，苏特勒秘密制造了一种生化病毒，并进行惨无人道的活体实验，男主角V正是当年人体试验品之一，可怕的病毒并没有侵蚀他的思想和意志，反而磨练了他超人般的体格和智慧，他后来的名字V源自于他当时被监禁的5号牢房（罗马数字中的5写作V）。\n\r\n\r\n影片的核心人物是自由斗士“V”，他头戴盖伊·福克斯面具，身披斗篷，以其非凡的身手、渊博的学识和充满仇恨的灵魂，成为了反抗极权统治的象征。V不仅是一个孤胆英雄，更是一个思想的启蒙者，他通过一系列暴力革命手段，揭露政府的暴行，唤醒民众的反抗意识，最终实现了对极权主义的审判。在这部影片中，我们看到一个领袖是如何在极权统治下挺身而出，以个人的力量对抗庞大的国家机器，为自由和正义而战。\n\r\n\r\n可以说，他的反抗行动充满了智慧和勇气，他巧妙地利用各种手段揭露政府的暴行和谎言，唤醒民众的反抗意识。他的行动虽然充满了暴力和破坏，但这些都是为了向极权统治发出强烈的挑战和抗议。他用自己的行动告诉世人，即使是最微小的力量，也能在关键时刻发挥出巨大的作用。\n\r\n\r\n影片中的女主角伊芙的成长也同样令人印象深刻，从一个体制内的良民，到最终成为反抗者的一员，伊芙的成长过程充满了痛苦与挣扎，但正是这些经历让她变得更加坚强和勇敢。\n\r\n\r\n男主角全程戴着盖伊·福克斯面具，原先饰演这个角色的演员是詹姆斯·鲍弗，但他无法忍受在整部电影中都戴着面具，开拍后六个星期便离开了剧组。女主角为了演出剧中剃光头的戏码，真的剪去了一头秀发。",

          "description": "2024 年的巴黎奥运会各项比赛正在如火如荼进行，但是在个人感官上，这一届的奥运会热度好像有点低。\n对于开幕式，有两点切身的感受比较深刻。一个是时间定于 7 月 27 日（星期六）凌晨，第二个是可以在电影院观看 2024 年巴黎奥运会开幕式直播。这些信息基于都是来源于自己在上班路上的听广播习惯，广州可进行奥运会开幕式观影预约的影院仅有 4 家，但需要达到最低拼场人数才可 \"开团\"！\n作为史上第一次把开幕式放在室外搞，也是首次摈弃以往步行进入体育场的传统，让运动员乘船沿着巴黎的\"主干道\" ——塞纳河前进。这届奥运会的确有点别出心裁。个人对于开幕式并没有什么特别值得期待的，也就事后通过各种短视频看了一下中国代表团出场、点燃圣火，以及其他零零散散的一些画面，感觉相比上一届的日本奥运会，巴黎奥运会给人印象更加深刻，文化底蕴、开放性、包容性都很不错，但也不可否认开幕式过后的各种两极分化评论，这的确也是争议性相当大的异常奥运会。\n奥运会最大的看点还是比赛。作为四年难得一遇的体育盛宴，各项赛程都很吸引人。\n个人最大的期待，还是在于羽毛球，小组赛的赛程也追了很多场，接下来依旧值得期待。跳水、游泳、排球、篮球，时间允许下肯定也是不能错过的。",

          "description": "经济不景气，就像一股寒风，吹得人心颤颤，市场更是进入严冬，就业、消费和投资都变得如履薄冰。\n从最近身边的很多人身上，由于大环境不景气带来的裁员比比皆是，IVD 行业、生信行业订单以肉眼可见的速度越来越少，小公司首先扛不住开启裁员，大公司从考核到绩效各种手段轮番上阵。\n\n好一点的公司 N+1 赔偿，但凤毛麟角；次一点的公司礼仪性的赔偿 1、2 个月的工资；更多的是领完当月工资走人；更有甚者，老板跑路，变相裁人的 ......\n裁人失业年年有，今年的暴风雨可能会更加猛烈些。铁打的营盘，流水的兵，除了比比谁更卷，还是要多思考一下自身的选择和规划。",
