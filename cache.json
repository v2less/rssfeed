          "description": "I've been watching Elon Musk's takeover of Twitter, and I've even been personally affected by it (negatively), so I wanted a way to vent using open-source software and some very basic art skills. I woke up yesterday with an idea in mind for a MAD Fold-In[1].\nA MAD Fold-In is a piece of artwork on the inside-back cover of each issue of \"MAD Magazine\". The main image can be folded to reveal a hidden, secondary image.\nI wanted to share my interactive picture with others, but printing a fold-in and mailing it to friends with instructions seemed really hard, so I searched for a digital way to do it.\nI found a blog post[2] from Thomas Park where he already did 100% of the work necessary to make a MAD Fold-In using nothing but CSS and HTML and a normal PNG image.\nUsing Inkscape and some Creative Commons images, I drafted a rough piece of artwork and tweaked it until the CSS folded it nicely.\nI wouldn't normally share here, but I think other HN readers may get some utility from seeing and trying out a purely CSS implementation of a MAD Fold-In, even if I didn't write the CSS myself. I'm hoping to start a trend where others make their own fold-ins.\nMoreover, Elon Musk picked today of all days to rebrand the Twitter logo as a unicode \"X\" character (ùïè). So, the Twitter bird really _did_ die today, as happened in my MAD fold-in, making my post somewhat topical and weirdly apropos.\nIf this post is too off-topic, please feel free to take it down. If it stays up, please let me know what you think. In the event my server goes down, I made a WayBack Machine archive of the site [3].\n[1] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mad_Fold-in\n[2] https://thomaspark.co/2020/06/the-mad-magazine-fold-in-effec...\n[3] https://web.archive.org/web/20230724221700/https://brendenhy...\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36855278\nPoints: 20\n# Comments: 4",

          "description": "Hi all! Excited to share cc.dev after months of work and refinement.\nThe idea for this product came from trying to do email marketing for my side project, CubeDesk, a site where Rubik's Cube enthusiasts can time themselves, race with one another, train algorithms ‚Äî it's a fun niche!\nWith over 40k users, sending even a single campaign was becoming expensive with MailChimp. I knew AWS SES would be much cheaper, but it‚Äôs just an API with none of the other necessities you need for a robust email marketing platform.\nBeyond cost, I was also frustrated with having to make sure my database was always in sync with MailChimp and the audience schema they enforced. If I wanted to email every user who had completed 10 solves, that would be a whole ordeal and eat up hours of my day.\nSo, I started (and am now launching):\nhttps://cc.dev\ncc.dev connects directly to your database and lets you write SQL queries to target your audience. It's backed by AWS SES, so the cost to send emails is significantly less than what you're used to seeing. Combined with a template builder, media management, and campaign monitoring, cc.dev is meant to be your final destination whenever you need to send marketing emails to your users.\nWould love to hear your feedback on this! If you're interested in trying out cc.dev as your email marketing platform, shoot me an email and let's have a chat: kash at cc.dev\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36836596\nPoints: 183\n# Comments: 77",

          "description": "Hi HN\nA few folks and I have been working on this project for a couple weeks now. After previously working on the Docker project for a number of years (both on the container runtime and image registry side), the recent rise in open source language models made us think something similar needed to exist for large language models too.\nWhile not exactly the same as running linux containers, running LLMs shares quite a few of the same challenges. There are \"base layers\" (e.g. models like Llama 2), specific configuration to run correctly (parameters, temperature, context window sizes etc). There's also embeddings that a model can use at runtime to look up data ‚Äì we don't support this yet but it's something we're looking at doing soon.\nIt's an early project, and there's still lots to do!\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36802582\nPoints: 142\n# Comments: 50",

          "description": "I quit my job last year and worked mostly on this full SwiftUI rewrite of my Japanese reading app, Manabi Reader. The rewrite gave me the opportunity to expand to macOS (and without Catalyst so it feels extra native) and redo the data layer to be offline-first via Realm with iCloud sync.\nThe biggest differentiators compared with other language study apps are that it tracks every word/kanji you read so that you can see how much of a given webpage/article you're already familiar with and other features/analytics built on that foundation; it automatically builds a personal corpus of example sentences; and that it does all the Japanese tokenization/dictionary lookups locally on-device and in a flexible web browser-like UI with readability mode, to be respectful of your privacy and to work offline.\nI've also added Anki integration. Tap a word, tap another button to save it to Anki with the original source material sentence and URL. I have a Manabi Flashcards app as well if you don't like Anki.\nPacked with free features. See what percent of each article's vocabulary you're familiar with based on your reading history. Scan paragraphs of text with your camera to look up words. Japanese/English dict. Native Japanese web dicts. Look up kanji by drawing. Expanded JLPT levels. RSS. Web browser UI. Save links from other apps. Works offline. Readability mode. Tap words to look them up. Furigana depending on your familiarity with each word.\nFuture plans: besides more features (ePUB, YouTube, mpv player, WaniKani integration, more languages, etc), I‚Äôm also preparing the underlying SwiftUI web browser lib as open source and will launch it as a WebKit-based browser/reader option, which I‚Äôm excited to get out alongside other interesting recent entrants to the desktop and mobile browser market.\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36674259\nPoints: 62\n# Comments: 30",

Beyond the code, there is likely some value in the extensive and largely complete implementation docs; basic benchmarks are linked in the README, too.\nKind of aiming to be \"the libavl for HAMTs\". That is obviously a high and aspirational bar but a distinct possibility if it stirs up a little interest and/or contribution.\nAnyways, it's time for this to go out, collect feedback and maybe even some use outside of toy projects.

So for any game I release I naturally I want to do the same.\nhttps://github.com/Mknsri/HockeySlam\nHockey Slam is a hockey shootout game on Android which I built almost from scratch. Some of the engine features include 3D graphics with PBR materials, a rudimentary physics system, replays, a multithreaded job system and a hot-reload DLL platform for developing on Windows.\nI detailed the creation of the game in it's own post, but now that time has passed I am releasing the source code and assets under the MIT license.

Full demo here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geNzY1nbCnU&t=2s.\nThe code (https://github.com/danswer-ai/danswer) is open source and permissively licensed (MIT). If you want to try it out, you can set it up locally with just a couple of commands (more details in our docs - https://docs.danswer.dev/introduction). We hope that someone out there finds this useful\nWe‚Äôd love to hear from you in our Slack (https://join.slack.com/t/danswer/shared_invite/zt-1u3h3ke3b-...)  or Discord (https://discord.gg/TDJ59cGV2X). Let us know what other features would be useful for you!\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36667374\nPoints: 139\n# Comments: 51",

          "description": "There are existing HN job aggregators, but I thought we could take it a step further.\nInspired by an insightful comment on a previous thread (https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36163021), I built a tool that aggregates job postings and intelligently categorizes them based on user-specific preferences:\n* Country and remote work preferences\n* Employer type (e.g., startup, corporation, government)\n* Industry\n* Technologies used\n* Role type (developer, architect, product owner, etc.)\n* Salary range (where available)\nOne of the superpowers of LLMs is reformatting information from any format X to any other format Y.\nWe leverage this to map all the unstructured job postings into the same unified structure. The new GPT functions feature and the extended context windows are really helpful for this.\nInstead of having to build a custom NER pipeline, it works very well with GPT out-of-the box.\nOne challenge is keeping the filters consistent and merging of duplicates. Embeddings help with that.\nWhat's next:\n* Integrate additional sources. We can generate web scrapers and data processing steps on the fly that extract and transform data into the same structure.\n* Add location distance filters.\n* Expand beyond jobs to monitor personalized data like events or real estate. Imagine using AI to rate local events from multiple sources based on your preferences, considering factors like your interests and distance from home.\n* Smaller improvements based on your feedback :)\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36574090\nPoints: 58\n# Comments: 14",

          "description": "Hey guys,\nEndless is an open-source mobile app that curates posts from your favorite websites in one place with a common interface. The application uses custom extractors specifically written for each website. This way you can endlessly scroll through posts and save the ones you like without having to deal with ads.\nWith the Endless server I am hosting you can also upvote and leave comments on posts without creating an account! With random tokens linked to your actions you basically use your device as your account and undo your actions in the future without spoiling your identity.\nI hope to add more extractors in the future. Feel free to install the app and check out the extractors yourself or contribute to the project! I always love to hear your comments and feedback.\nGitHub: https://github.com/kaangiray26/endless\nAPK Releases: https://github.com/kaangiray26/endless/releases\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36496644\nPoints: 62\n# Comments: 24",

          "description": "I worked on a web service that allows you to import a song and define a target length that the song will be shortened or lengthened to. It does this by analyzing the song and finding repeating audio patterns. This is helpful for making any song match a video or performance with a set duration. You can also specify areas of the song to prefer or avoid. An example is available here: https://mofi.loud.red/edit/8bd3fdf780f8c3927e41029f3b957f8a7...\nThe cool thing is that after the song is analyzed on the server, the client can recompute and preview the results completely client-side through an implementation that uses Web Workers and WebAssembly. The audio previewing uses Tone.js. I am thinking of writing up some more details about the implementation in the future.\nI'm still working on a way to explain this easily, but I like the idea of carrying over the concept of content-aware fill from images to audio.\nPlease let me know if you have any comments or questions!\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36480687\nPoints: 410\n# Comments: 118",

          "description": "Hi HN, I recently created and published an open-source resume builder as a weekend project. The idea came to me while I was mentoring students and noticing common mistakes they made in their resumes that I had also made in the past. I thought to build a tool to help people easily create a modern professional resume with built-in best practices to avoid those mistakes.\nTop highlights of the resume builder are:\n1. Real time UI update as you type\n2. ATS friendly to top ATS platforms, e.g. Greenhouse, Lever\n3. Privacy focus - no sign up is required and data is stored locally in browser that only users have access\n4. Support import from existing resume PDF\nThe tool also includes a resume parser to help people test their existing resumes‚Äô ATS readability if they might not be interested in using the builder. I also explained the parser algorithm in an article with interactive tables that might be an interesting read to see the steps and logics it uses (https://www.open-resume.com/resume-parser).\nI hope others might find this tool useful and I look forward to hearing any feedback the community has. Thanks all.\nHome Page: https://open-resume.com\nGithub Repo: https://github.com/xitanggg/open-resume\nProduct Hunt: https://producthunt.com/posts/openresume\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36470297\nPoints: 408\n# Comments: 135",

Every time I unplug/plug in an external monitor, all the windows are dumped back into one workspace. This is extremely frustrating, as I tend to have 50-100 windows open, all grouped into workspaces according to my workflow, and I have multiple offices, each with its own multi-monitor setup. For example, if I want to go to my boss's office to show him some data, I have to unplug my computer and plug it into a Vibe board in his office, but then I lose all my workspaces and it takes a while to find whatever I was working on!\n This is a recognized bug in GNOME, and it seems doubtful it'll be fixed anytime soon.

          "description": "Hi 1st of all. Despite being distro hopping for more than 4 years on Linux (always on intel) and never really sticks to it due to previous workplace requirement on running windows specifics softwares, I'm still very VERY ultra noob when it comes to Linux. So If my questions sounds really stupid, please direct me what to look in order to learn.\n I've recently bought an Asus TUF A15 with Ryzen 7 4800H + RTX 3050 Ti combo. After a week of using it, I have the board fried after running Linux on VM while installing Visual studio in Windows. (My very first time to decide on AMD, had no idea when I jumped in lol)\n The store where I bought it gave me a new unit replacement since it happened on the 6th day after my purchase. (Something about Asus policy saved my ass)\n My question are. I would like to install Linux on this laptop. I've had my success on MSI GF75 Thin 9SC (intel) in controlling my fan speed.\n But for the Asus TUF A15, I understood that AMD SMU are controlling the fan and no way to control them manualy? (Correct me if I'm wrong). (Oh and theres no way to manualy control this in windows too)\n So given my experience on the Asus TUF A15, if I would just swing it and install Linux. Will it cause problems like getting my laptop board fried again? To be honest I can't afford another laptop anymore. ü§£ü§£ü§£\n I tried installing Mint and Pop OS on a second nvme, everything seems to work for me, nothing I wasn't able to google and fix. However, my concern was the fan/heat. As on my MSI, I would run my python script and it would be hot and I'll just turn my fan to boost mode. I'm afraid to test this on the Asus TBH.\n Man, I hope im not getting roast for this, kinda stupid question üòÖ\n    submitted by    /u/Sleepy_N_Walking  \n [link]   [comments]",

This'll be called the UHP Open Standard and will run on Windows, Mac and Linux. It'll also be built into Tectonic Marketplace, which will be a Chromium based app meant to allow the user to download and run UHPs. The user can also drag 3rd party UHP files into the app and install them. \n We need people that are familiar with: - the Chromium codebase (!!!) - GTK theming - making Debian applications - basic web development (HTML, CSS, JS)\n If you're interested, get in touch with me either here or on Discord. My username is @kantraa. We can discuss this further if you want and I will add you to our development group. This project is 100% non-profit, so because of that and other things right now there won't be any pay unfortunately. It's driven by pure passion and any future donators once we get started with them in the not so distant future.\n -‚ò¢Ô∏è K\n    submitted by    /u/Alpha012_GD  \n [link]   [comments]",

It returns the output in a JSON format, thus enabling users to parse it according to their liking or forward it to any other tool for further processing.\n In short, BucketLoot has the following features: 1. Scan for secret exposures 2. Extract assets such as URLs, Subdomains and Domains 3. Search for custom keywords or regex queries \n The tool can help people like bug hunters and penetration testing folks to step up their recon game and go beyond the traditional tools available in the market.\n In case you would like to know more about BucketLoot, make sure to head over to our blog @ RedHunt Labs which gives a brief walkthrough of the tool: https://redhuntlabs.com/blog/introducing-bucketloot-an-automated-cloud-bucket-inspector/\n    submitted by    /u/0x9747  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "VFS (Virtual File System, aka Virtual File Switch) is a software component of Linux which is responsible for the filesystem interface exposed to user-mode applications. Using it allows the kernel to provide an abstraction layer that makes implementation of different filesystems very easy (https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/next/filesystems/vfs.html).\n Overall, VFS is masking the implementation details of a specific filesystem behind generic system calls (open/read/write/close/etc), which are mostly exposed to user-mode application by some wrappers in libc ‚Äî as shown in the diagram below (https://www.starlab.io/blog/introduction-to-the-linux-virtual-filesystem-vfs-part-i-a-high-level-tour).\n Moreover, we can say that the main goal of VFS is to allow user-mode applications to access different filesystems (think about NTFS, FAT, etc.) in the same way. There are four main objects in VFS: superblock, dentries, inodes and files (https://www.win.tue.nl/~aeb/linux/lk/lk-8.html).\n Thus, ‚Äúinode‚Äù (https://medium.com/@boutnaru/linux-what-is-an-inode-7ba47a519940) is what the kernel uses to keep track of files. Because a file can have several names there are ‚Äúdentries‚Äù (‚Äúdirectory entries‚Äù) which represent pathnames. Also, due to the fact a couple of processes can have the same file opened (for read/write) there is a ‚Äúfile‚Äù structure that holds the information for each one (such as the cursor position). The ‚Äúsuperblock‚Äù structure holds data which is needed for performing actions on the filesystem ‚Äî more details about all of those and more (like mounting) are going to be published in the near future.\n Lastly, there are also other relevant data structures that I will post on in the near future (‚Äúfilesystem‚Äù, ‚Äúvfsmount‚Äù, ‚Äúnameidata‚Äù and ‚Äúaddress_space‚Äù).\n ‚Äã\n https://www.starlab.io/blog/introduction-to-the-linux-virtual-filesystem-vfs-part-i-a-high-level-tour\n    submitted by    /u/boutnaru  \n [link]   [comments]",

Unfortunately, with Wayland XScreensaver doesn't work so well and for that I don't blame the package as it simply is not implemented for Wayland in any manner.\n Don't get me wrong, there is something to be said for a system going into a semi-sleep mode when GNOME blanks the screen and the system becomes idle and the internal temperature is lowered by a lot. It is quite useful but also quite boring, and yes, I am aware of the goal of saving power for various reasons. Still, though, I've been entertained over the years by the sheer multitude of screen savers included in the package and enjoy watching them cycle along every few minutes or so. I also don't mind if the screen saver package blanks the screen after a half hour or so (user configurable, of course). At least with a screen saver I know my system hasn't crashed!\n Perhaps the limitation is technical and Wayland doesn't have the API that would permit a screen saver to work as it can on X.

Anyway, for example here are some issues I've had:\n - gtk issues (e.g. file chooser widget crash), that got patched a few days later.\n - SDL 2 crash on fullscreen issues, that got patched a few weeks later\n More recently:\n - Steam did a big update on their desktop ui and now I have to hold ctrl when mouse clicking widgets. Super annoying.\n - Anything going fullscreen is now having hiccups.\n So I googled what desktop environment steam deck uses, figuring that at least will get tested. So I installed kde-plasma-x11. The steam ctrl workaround is not necessary under that DE. And fullscreen doesn't hiccup. But I hate plasma. Everything is super slow to launch (i.e. 2 seconds). Worst, installing kde screwed up my configs and openbox is ugly now, and tracker3 is misbehaving so openging nautilus in openbox takes 10 seconds. I don't want to fix that issue because Steam and fullscreen still misbehave at the time of writing when I use openbox.\n I thought openbox was super stable, and the whole point of it was an exercice in writing a X11 compliant window manager. Is KDE full of non standard hack, which is why it works well while openbox doesn't? Or is there bugs in openbox that just will never get fixed and I should ditch it. Anyway. I know, this is a rant now. But my computer was running nice under it, and now it's not enjoyable under kde.

I am asking here because of the linux/mainboard issue.\n So, when I shutdown my pc it's sometimes stuck in a white text saying that the system is shutting down but still remains turned on. That happend over night and now my graphics card is not useable anymore. I've read somewhen that this is a mainboard issue with linux which is why I would prefer to also replace the mainboard. I can't find anything on what mainboard would work as it should tho.\n My processor:\n Intel(R) Core(TM) i5-7400 CPU @ 3.00GHz\n My RAM is 16gb of DDR4 RAM in dual channel.\n Current Mainboard: MSI H110M Pro-D\n I would prefer to buy an amd graphics card.

After updating some of the python2 scripts to python3, a brutal series of C compilation errors started coming. After some of those bugs were fixed, feels like it would help if I could just upgrade to the latest LTS 6.1.\n As a newbie, I directly merged the tag with my kernel and that was a disaster. There have been a lot of changes between and so I went back to fixing the old bugs for now.

          "description": "I've been using a dual boot setup with Arch and Ubuntu on my system, and I've noticed an interesting issue. Among the various popular Linux distributions I've tried, it seems that only Ubuntu can handle more resources effectively. I'll provide some details:\n  \nRAM: 4 GB\n Processor: Intel Core i5 8th gen\n GPU 1: Intel UHD 620\n GPU 2: AMD Radeon 520 (Unfortunately, it doesn't work correctly on any Linux distro, including Ubuntu)\n Storage: SSD\n  \nSpecifically, when it comes to resource-intensive tasks like running the Free and Open Source game 0.A.D. or using the Matlab software, only Ubuntu seems to handle them without any issues. However, on other distros like Arch, Debian, and Fedora, running these applications causes freezes and performance problems.\n On the other hand, for simple and lightweight tasks, I haven't experienced any problems on any of the mentioned distros.\n I'm curious to know why this discrepancy exists. Has anyone else encountered similar resource handling differences among various Linux distributions?\n    submitted by    /u/Lonely-Maximum-3750  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "For the curious newbies out there:\n Repositories are one of the essential part of a distribution. Still, they are the most obscure knowledge piece about it. As far as i know Arch Linux with its official repositories and AUR has one of the largest package base leaving aside NixOS which is different on its own and is its own league. Debian boasts one of the largest official binary package database. Ubuntu hosts its own repositories and PopOS which is based on Ubuntu its seems is hosting its own repositories too. Fedora also has official as well as community repositories but its package collection is rather smaller than others.\n Flatpak, Snap, AppImage transcends the Distro packaging scheme and are standalone application pacakagers. They are their own base and are distroindependent. I don't know package count on them as they can be pretty susceptible to spaming. They also solve binary distribution problem for proprietary vendors and add useful features like sandboxing and portals generally enhancing the supposed security of the system. \n    submitted by    /u/Own_Language7325  \n [link]   [comments]",

I‚Äôm forced to use windows as a scientific workstation on my work computer as a government data scientist and I completely understand why, and I have no expectations that Linux will ‚Äúwin on the desktop‚Äù, because it doesn‚Äôt need to.\n Despite so many Linux fans out there thinking really hard /s about how the community can best strategize to have a completely open hardware and software platform take over households across the world, in all use cases, especially the ones the Linux kernel is least suited for (like RTOS applications directing self driving cars, and, no the driving subsystems of Tesla don‚Äôt run on linux, the infotainment system does), we still have really nice linux things!\n On my desktop, I can run hyprland basically flawlessly with my 3070 using proprietary nvidia drivers. I just got a steam deck and now I can play all of my favorite video games on my couch in 4K on my big ol TV with a wireless controller. I still use a pretty locked down andoid phone for many things (though an iPhone for daily use because privacy). I have a raspberry pi to serve as the data collection backend for my home brewed weather station. My TV and both of my partners TVs have Linux as their smart TV OS.\n All of these things are a mix of GPLed software and binary blobs/closed source elements. It‚Äôs amazing just how robust the corporate environment for Linux really is and how it drives innovation and competition.\n And Debian is also a thing, I guess. Kinda.\n The truly best thing about Linux is how all the really serious developers aren‚Äôt ESR or RMS. They‚Äôre actually rational, successful people.

I'm curious to know if this would be a good and powerful choice for running Linux smoothly. I understand that Linux doesn't necessarily require a high-end processor to perform well, but I value your input on this matter. The reason behind my inquiry is that my current laptop, which is equipped with an NVIDIA RTX 3070, tends to encounter occasional issues after software updates...\n Considering these factors, I'm contemplating a switch to an AMD-based system. Hence, I would greatly appreciate hearing your thoughts and opinions on AMD processors and their compatibility with Linux.\n As for my background, I am a simple user who is currently studying IT. I spend my free time coding and playing casual games. \n Here is the link of this new laptop: https://wccftech.com/xiaomi-unveils-redmibook-pro-15-ryzen-edition-laptop-amd-ryzen-7-7840hs-apu/\n Thank you\n    submitted by    /u/mavinii  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Ever since I started seriously using Linux a few years ago, I always used Wayland. I really liked Fedora, so I used GNOME on Wayland, I also tried using KDE for a while, but that was also on Wayland. Overall, I barely touched Xorg during this entire time. I tried booting GNOME on Xorg but my touchpad gestures stopped working, so I immediately turned it off. Why bother with it if it's the outdated display server?\n Through my Linux experience, I discovered many issues - I desperately needed fractional scaling on my 14 inch 1080p laptop, which was always a blurry nightmare and I never managed to make it usable. I also experienced some visual glitches, like windows disappearing on GNOME with multiple monitors, etc. and I always figured that that's just what the Linux experience is like.\n Fast forward to a few days ago, when I installed Arch with the i3 window manager, the first environment running on Xorg that I've seriously used. And wow. So many issues are just gone, or at least very solvable. None of my apps are blurry with fractional scaling. Everything is smooth and looks good. It's like a different world.\n Wayland has some very cool features, like the responsive touchpad gestures, and it's definitely great for the future of Linux. As of now, if you're also bothered by the issues I was, consider giving them up for a way smoother and reliable desktop experience.\n    submitted by    /u/azdrawee  \n [link]   [comments]",

You can check it out here: https://medium.com/@hkarakose/keep-your-cron-entries-safe-37fd33b2667e\n I believe this script could be helpful for others who rely on cron for their backups. I welcome your comments and suggestions to further improve it.\n Thank you for your time!\n    submitted by    /u/Charming-Idea-2021  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I see many people talking about choosing the right hardware to run Linux and I always thought there were exaggerating. I was so wrong.\n Recently I decided to build a new PC and since I was using Linux on my laptop I thought \"Well, if I am building a new machine why not make it fully compatible with Linux?\"\n So I did it. Every single part of my build has good support for Linux. AMD Ryzen, ATI Radeon, etc., etc... I could not be happier. Everything works just as it was supposed to. I am running Fedora with Wayland and it has been an amazing experience.\n Newcomers to Linux should know that: If you just bought your PC it probably was designed to run Windows or MAC. Most companies do not care about Linux (yes, I am talking to you Nvdia). It does not mean that it won't run Linux, it just means that it has a great chance of not being a good experience and random problems will happen. Everything on Linux was made by people who dedicate some of their time to making things work because companies do not. They do an amazing job, but it is not the same as having all info necessary. Sure, your system can run very well, but it will never be as good as a well-thought Linux-compatible PC.\n You do not have to build one. Just find a company that sells laptops for example with full Linux support and you will be amazed by how good it is .\n ‚Äã\n TL;DR: To get the whole Linux experience you have to care about hardware as well. \n    submitted by    /u/colutti  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hi! I have a laptop which I use once in a while, but I will use it constantly in august, and which at the moment runs Fedora 38. I am not liking it that much and I want to change. Since I don't have a regular connection I prefer a distro that doesn't update as much as a rolling release. So I am uncertain between Opensuse Leap (whivh I never user, I am a Tumbeweed user in another laptop) and MxLinux, which I used some time ago and found really good. MxLinux 23 is still in beta, but Opensuse Leap has an uncertain future, as far as I understood (or am I wrong?). \n So, what do you suggest? Leap or MxLinux 23 still in beta?\n Thank you for any suggestion Paola\n    submitted by    /u/paolab79  \n [link]   [comments]",

Even though I'm sure about this change, I can't decide wich distro use. So far the only thing I'm sure about is that I'll choose an ubuntu based one.\n On my research I narrowed down to 2 options: Pop os and Zorin os.\n The thing that bums me out about Zorin Os is the fact that Zorin Group seems to take a lot of time to release a new update to their OS. And the thing that bums me out about Pop os is that they're about to change gnome for cosmic, and I don't know what to expect from this change. Will it be worse than gnome? I don't really know.\n But after all, I realize that for coding I won't have any big difference between theese two or any other distro. I just want to go for the one with the easiest usage for my daily activities.\n ‚Äã\n ** I'm Brazilian so I apologize for any grammar mistake, English is not my mother tongue.

Everything is working but only when I booted back to live USB, i found out I could modify the partition easily. I think it is a huge vulnerability.\n I made some minimal changes to the installation, like installing one or two packages and updating. So it isn't hard to reinstall and set everything up again. The problem is I am afraid it will cause additional writes to SSD and therefore reducing lifespan. (I know it's negligible and the one I am using isn't from a random brand.)\n So, is it worth it to perform a reinstall with encryption? Also what encryption should I use as a balance between performance and security?\n Btw, should I encrypt the EFI partition (/boot/efi) on the external SSD?

It's now possible download and install software packages in the VM.\n Better usability on small screen devices, allowing keyboard input and easy scrolling the VM screen.\n Login credentials and instructions are displayed for some distros to easily enter into live mode\n Improvements to minimize latency while accessing VMs.\n  \nI have also received requests to enable disks in the VMs to try out the installation process. However, it is not currently feasible due to cost concerns.\n Many thanks to everyone who donated and sent their valuable suggestions. I hope you all will find the updates useful. Check it out now at DistroSea- Test drive Linux distros online\n Note: Do not access personal data inside the VMs. Please shutdown the VM after use to immediately allocate the server resources for another user.\n I'm currently looking for sponsors. Please get in touch if you are interested in backing my work.\n    submitted by    /u/basilky  \n [link]   [comments]",

I posted my write-up online[1] and was discussing it on Reddit[2], among other places.\n It seems, however, that Office 365 is rendering quite a few of Calibri Regular characters, but not Calibri Light, using Lato on Linux systems. This doesn't affect MacOS, which doesn't have Calibri installed by default, nor Calibri Light, which looks and works as expected on Office 365 also when accessed from Linux Systems.\n Can some of you friendly folk with access to Office 356 upload a screenshot of what you see when you format the words \"Calibri Regular\" with Calibri and Calibri Light on Word (at 18px) and Power Point (at 96px)?\n The curiosity is killing us :)\n Thanks !\n [1] https://jdsalaro.com/note/comparison-new-microsoft-default-font-calibri-aptos/\n [2] https://www.reddit.com/r/typography/comments/14zenfg/a_quick_look_into_microsofts_new_default_font/\n    submitted by    /u/jdsalaro  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "TL;DR Just some venting about a broken installation...\n My Arch installation just broke some hours ago. Working like a charm for quite some time now, this is the first major issue (besides those pesky Nvidia drivers) I encountered. And, to be honest, I have absolutely no idea what happened, my PC seemingly decided to not recognize the SSD as something it should boot from anymore. My first attempt at fixing this was checking the GPT / MBR and partitions with a Ubuntu live-installation using gdisk, which promptly complained that the EFI partition was not aligned properly. Wondered (still do) how that happened but proceeded to fix it with parted. I also mounted the partitions to check whether some important files were missing or corrupted, but everything was normal. With the GPT being valid, all partitions aligned and working and the boot flags set where needed I though my work was done and blissedly rebooted. Of course it didn't work. I unplugged every other drive that could somehow get in the way in the boot order (my PC is sometimes a bit whacky in regards to that), still not working. Then it occurred to me that maybe GRUB was somehow damaged and it could not load the 2nd or even 1st stage or something like that (I had used grub-install just before it broke down, but neither on the drive nor the partitions in question). Back on the Ubuntu I checked for that but it seems to be fine. As of now I currently contemplate whether it is worth to fiddle around some more or if it'd be better to just re-install and then restore my data.\n    submitted by    /u/Valcalen  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "To access the OpenVPN server on your Synology device from outside the mobile operator's network, you need to set up proper port forwarding on the router that is connected to the mobile operator's network. Here are some steps to take:\n  \nSet up an OpenVPN server on your Synology device using the DSM admin interface. Make sure all necessary settings are configured, such as IP addresses, authentication protocols, and certificates.\n \nOn the router that is connected to the mobile operator's network, you need to forward the OpenVPN ports to the IP address of your Synology device. The standard OpenVPN port is 1194 (UDP). Check your router's manual for how to set up port forwarding.\n \nFor mobile carriers, you may also need to set up network address translation (NAT) on your router to redirect traffic from the external network to your Synology device's IP address on your local network. Consult your mobile operator's documentation or support for specific NAT setup instructions.\n \nMake sure the OpenVPN server is running on your Synology device.\n \n After completing these steps, you should be able to connect to the OpenVPN server on your Synology device from outside your mobile operator's network using the public IP address or dynamic DNS assigned to your router.\n It is also worth remembering that some mobile operators may block certain ports or protocols, which may make it difficult to access from outside. In this case, contact your mobile operator for more information on restrictions and how to bypass them.\n    submitted by    /u/maciej1993  \n [link]   [comments]",

I struggled with a few things such as scrolling files off screen, hovering them properly, resetting cursor position, etc. I've since learned more and implemented all my knowledge. This time around I made a push and pop implementation for bash, in bash, which made writing this file manager much easier. I wrote this to increase my productivity on the commandline; This allows me to navigates files much quicker and edit them without any trouble, no more worrying about copy/pasting names, remembering them or using wildcards to make up the difference. Instead of ls, cd, EDITOR, pwd, etc - They are handled by simply using the arrow keys or H, J, K, L respectively\n This is a compelete rewrite focused on stability, simplicity and design before continuing on to features. Majority of the fearures mentioned in the README.md are not implemented yet (adding more features is not hard). Anyway, I'm curious what everyone thinks about it; If you'd use it, what could change, etc. Any testers, contributions or feedback is really, much appreciated!\n    submitted by    /u/wick3dr0se  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "You might have heard the news that China has released a homegrown Linux distro dubbed OpenKylin. I know very well that stuff made-in-China (especially those labeled \"independently created\") can be pretty sloppy in implementation details. So consider this post \"how not to properly configure a Linux system\". Here we go:\n  \nThe ISO archive doesn't have checksums. MD5 values are available at the official website\n Some common CLI utilities (less, man) are not installed by default.\n I've received two system upgrades since fresh install. Both upgrades are tagged w/ version 602.0001 and share the same patch notes. The version number cannot be found in dpkg -l. There must be another package management mechanism running. \n ...and it's definitely not Flatpak. Although Flatpak is preinstalled, no remotes (not even flathub) are preconfigured\n \n APT is configured w/ APT::Get::AllowUnauthenticated=true, effectively bypasses package signing. \n Combining the fact that the default APT repository is accessed via plain-text HTTP, this is wide open to man-in-the-middle attacks.\n \n Docker is preinstalled and enabled. The Docker bridge network is configured as \"bip\": \"128.128.0.1/16\". You can't access this part of the Internet anymore.\n (Important) packages can be outdated. ca-certificates is at version 20190110 which is four years old.\n /etc/localtime is a symlink to /usr/share/zoneinfo/Asia/Shanghai but the content of /etc/timezone is Etc/UTC.\n Proprietary packages (e.g. nvidia-driver-510) can be installed via apt without editing the default sources.list. I guess they don't have to worry about legal issues.\n Like Ubuntu, systemd-resolved is the default DNS service. But theres' also a dnsmasq service enabled, listening to 127.0.0.1:53 with the default upstream set to 114.114.114.114 (provided by www.114dns.com) \n Though systemd-resolved is running with stock config file. No custom upstream configured.\n \n  \nFeel free to ask me for stuff that you are curious about.\n    submitted by    /u/ImaginaryMarketing  \n [link]   [comments]",

I was wondering if anyone could recommend something that has these features. \n 1 - Wayland Support\n 2 - Rolling Updates/Releases\n 3 - KDE Support(I can normally add this myself)\n 4 - DNF or APT (ANYTHING but pacman. I hate pacman) \n I have considered Rocky Linux or Fedora. But I am not sure how good the Wayland support in either of those are right now. I am currently running this. I am wanting to setup a highly customized system that I can compile the Kernel for myself. I used Gentoo for a bit but I occasionally need to use programs for work that are on Linux but dont have all open source binaries and I am then limited to RPM/DEB packages.. Having to compile everything from source or be forced to use snap / flatpaks is a no go for me.. If I could use DEB or RPM packages I would stick with Gentoo. Also please excuse my ugly KDE ui.

Outside of certain software that did require windows, I have, for the most part, successfully did everything that I‚Äôve needed to with Linux, including using LTSpice and Matlab. Speaking with other engineering students, as the topic of windows beginning to become a subscription was being discussed, why not look into using Linux instead, and they responded as it was unnecessary, and they felt it‚Äôs too much. \n What I am wondering, is whether having experience with Linux is inevitably beneficial, outside of any CS/E degrees, and whether it makes a difference in the end for non CS/E engineers?\n Edit: thank you for who have responded, I am referring to any engineering field outside of Computer Science/Computer Engineering\n    submitted by    /u/EETQuestions  \n [link]   [comments]",

I was deeply addicted to gaming, sinking lower and lower, year by year. I was a complete loser, life was challenging and depressing, and I couldn't feel any joy.\n Then, in one computer science lecture, the professor was talking about Linux, and mentioned, ‚ÄúLinux is an important OS for computer science. But I don't think any of you should install it, because it will break your computer, unless you know what you're doing.‚Äù\n I had heard of Linux, but used to dismiss it as a niche OS. Curiosity got the better of me, and I decided to try it out anyway, my first distro being Ubuntu. I was amazed how well it ran compared to Windows. I was also learning new stuff and customizing things left and right.\n Even more amazingly, I felt joy for the first time in a long time. Real joy.\n However, I didn't know what I was doing, and broke my computer just as the professor foretold. I had to reinstall Ubuntu many times. During one of these reinstall, I accidentally wiped the entire disk, including the Windows installation I was dual-booting to play my games.\n The enjoyment I got from using and customizing Linux, combined with a laziness to install Windows, was exactly what I needed to eventually get rid of my gaming addiction. It had a hold over me for over a decade, and I was finally free. Linux also led the way to me rediscovering some of my older hobbies, as well as restoring my enjoyment of coding.\n Now, one year from that journal entry, life is still incredibly difficult and overwhelming at times, but I have regained hope. And I find joy in my activities, not the least of which is simply using my computer running Linux. Linux saved my life and turned it around.

          "description": "I've had quite the long think about what RHEL has been doing to the open source projects a great many of us know and love (first CentOS, now Alma, Rocky, etc.) and I think the problem is summed up like this: \"Line goes up\"\n If a publicly traded company is behind an open source project, that open source project is at risk because, line must go up. They will make up any excuse why the line is not going up and make terrible decisions to hopefully make the line go up.\n I've been a CentOS user for years and now a rocky linux user, but I think it's time to leave that flavor behind entirely. So with that in mind I was looking at other options, Ubuntu being one of them because of the option for enterprise support, but there it is again \"Line goes up\".\n This is why I intend to switch to Debian 12, the latest long term supported version of Debian. Debian is bona fide community run open source project with no profit margins, shareholders, executives, etc. Therefore for Debian there is no line that must go up.\n I implore you as Linux lovers and enjoyers to switch to a distribution in no way tied to a company or gets source from a company and return to the community backed projects that made Linux what it is today.\n Edit: it's surprising to me people still don't know what the issue is.

          "description": "One often stated premise as to why the GPLv2 and certain licenses deemed incompatible by the community is: dynamic linking obviously creates a derived work.\n See for instance the Software Freedom Conservancy's view:\n  \nThe FSF, stewards of the GPL, have stated many times over the past decades that they believe there is no legal distinction between dynamic and static linking of a C program and we agree.\n  \nBut is there any solid reason to believe this is the case? Any case law? Any reasoning from similar facts?\n Because my admittedly shallow view is -- I'm just not sure a copyright license has this kind of power.\n Imagine an extreme case, you build some software which links to MegaEvil Corp's libc, which license specifically states, if you dynamically link to this libc, your work is a derived work of MegaCorp libc, and you forfeit all claims of copyright of your work to MegaEvil Corp. My guess is many courts would say building any such software at an API boundary would be fair use, and copyright law simply does not grant any court the power to enforce this copyright term.\n Why might I guess this is the case? Because courts have actually taken similar positions several times re: software fair use. See, Sega Enterprises Ltd. v. Accolade, Inc., 977 F.2d 1510 (9th Cir. 1992), and Lewis Galoob Toys, Inc. v. Nintendo of America, Inc., 780 F. Supp. 1283 (N.D. Cal. 1991).\n But much worse than the SFC and FSF simply being incorrect is, I worry they either 1) don't know any better or are 2) purposefully misleading users about what the GPL says, and how copyright law works. By encouraging a cramped reading of the GPL and ignoring copyright fair use, they are actually making it harder to build software which interoperates with other software (see ZFS and Linux), and, while the FSF seemed to take Google's side in the Oracle v. Google case, their reasoning re: dynamic linking puts them squarely within Oracle's intellectual camp with respect to copyright fair use.\n    submitted by    /u/small_kimono  \n [link]   [comments]",

However, I need to make use of AutoCAD for several of my classes, and I imagine the same is true in the professional setting. I'm aware of the existence of alternatives such as LibreCAD and FreeCAD, but from what I understand these alternatives are not up to industry standards at this point in time.\n Is virtualization up to the point where I can viably use it to run the software I need?

From other posts, I have seen that you typically get the take-home test after an HR call. But my stages went like this: written assessment -> IQ test -> take-home assessment. So I did 3 rounds with them without talking to a human.\n They rejected me with a template email that they send to everyone. I expect at least some feedback after a non-trivial take-home assessment and multiple rounds. They said they can't provide feedback because of the large volume of applicants (that seems unlikely. I see this position posted on LinkedIn every week and it gets 3 applicants on a good week). Can any of you check my assessment and give me some feedback on it, please?\n Project: Github link (the problem statement is there, it is a client-server application where the server verifies the X509 certificate of the client)\n P.S.

She said what am I doing with my computer and I just said installing Linux which was HORRIBLE to her. She said I was breaking my PC with unknown software.\n I tried to explain what linux was saying it's an open-source competitor to windows and it was safe nor damaging anything. Apparently I needed further justification so I stated (I use a cracked version of windows) it had more customizability, offered more safety and privacy. Apparently I have 'something to hide' for context I have a history of anxiety & psychosis which is known to her.\n Eventually she looked up what linux was: 'All the top results said it was great but when I scrolled down it said tor was used for terrorist, drug deals and various other crimes. She didn't even notice that tor and linux was different from 5 minutes of research. I tried to argue saying it was cherry-picked and a scandal by the media to which and I kid you not she compared me to flat earthers. I know tor & linux are used for crime but jesus christ that's a jump.\n She threatened to take my computer away which I am not a child (later years of HS), I guess she thinks I'm psychotic for wanting privacy for f*ck sakes.\n Also throwaway because if she found my main and my slightly-deviant opinions on various topics I might as well write a note saying goodbye.\n PS: Tips on hiding Linux are greatly appreciated and programs to encrypt my drives.

          "description": "An inode (aka index node) is a data structure used by Unix/Linux like filesystems in order to describe a filesystem object. Such an object could be a file or a directory. Every inode stores pointers to the disk block‚Äôs locations of the object‚Äôs data and metadata (https://www.bluematador.com/blog/what-is-an-inode-and-what-are-they-used-for). An illustration of that is shown below.\n Overall, the metadata contained in an inode is: file type (regular file/directory/symbolic link/block special file/character special file/etc), permissions, owner id, group id, size, last accessed time, last modified time, creation time and number of hard links (https://www.stackscale.com/blog/inodes-linux/).\n By using inodes the filesystem tracks all files/directories saved on disk. Also, by using inodes we can read any specific byte in the data of a file very effectively. We can see the number of total inodes per mounted filesystem using the command ‚Äúdf -i‚Äù (https://linux.die.net/man/1/df). Also, we can see the inode of a file/directory and other metadata of the file using the command ‚Äúls -i‚Äù (https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/ls.1.html) or ‚Äústat‚Äù (https://linux.die.net/man/1/stat). By the way, the ‚Äústat‚Äù command uses the ‚Äústat‚Äù syscall (https://linux.die.net/man/2/stat).\n Lastly, you can check out ‚Äústruct inode‚Äù in the source code of the Linux kernel (https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v6.4.2/source/include/linux/fs.h#L612).

I am among the few lucky devs that are allowed to have a Linux machine, where I am running Ubuntu 22.04 LTS. This setup mostly works great for me, however the MS Teams Client is a real painpoint. I can live without features present in the windows client like background blur/image, reactions in a call, and sharing single windows, but the horrible effect on system responsiveness that Teams produces is not bearable. When I'm in a call my machine becomes noticably less snappy, which does not happen for my colleagues with windows machines. Turning off my camera seems to help as does disabling incoming video. Every time I share screen my machine becomes very laggy and everything happens in slow motion. The internet is mostly along the lines of \"you will have to live with that\", so: Does anyone here have similar experiences? Are there any tweaks that helped you resolve these issues? Any other directions I could look into?\n    submitted by    /u/DiffUser123  \n [link]   [comments]",

Nothing was included. Every single basic step involved running into roadblocks, researching them, trying out various solutions and experimenting to get it working. And some things never worked.\n Wifi? - no driver for my wifi adapter. Have to install a driver, and it has missing dependencies.\n Bluetooth? - no bluetooth software. Have to figure it out too.\n Samba? - No samba client. No samba server. Have to set it up by editing conf files. Never got it working right.\n FTP? - No FTP. Have to set it up. More conf files. Never got it working right.\n Don't want the computer to go to sleep? More conf files.\n Anyway ... after a few days of this I gave up, installed Ubuntu and got everything set up easily in a few hours.\n Nevertheless -- I take seriously people's criticisms of the direction Ubuntu is going in. So my question is -- is there another distro out there that won't have me tearing my hair out? That includes the basic functionality of a modern OS?\n I'm very distrustful of the distro \"round-ups\" online, because none of them gave me any indication of what a DIY nightmare Debian was.\n    submitted by    /u/icelandic_toe_thumb  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hello,\n I find myself questioning whether using GUI is actually a good thing. I've seen people online making videos about how tiling window managers are undermining your productivity, and that things like it are just a distraction. A regular person is/should incapable of multitasking when they are focussed on let's say, programming.\n There's further discussions to be had about stripping any shell/terminal of syntax highlighting, as well as code syntax highlighting, and having everything be the same color.\n I'm mainly concerned with this as I am trying to find a way to use linux to train myself to become a better programmer, and to function in a development environment where GUIless is the standard.\n Another frequent problem is that GUI adjacent stuff always sparks a lot of conversation and I want to ideally have an environment that is as neutral and unexpressive as possible, because I don't want any slight hint of expression of personality ruining my job prospects. For this reason I always stick to default color themes and fonts, because these choices were made for me, and therefore by not changing them I am not expressing any opinion. My job is to do my job.\n How is this looked upon in industries where people use linux distros in production? I really need to commit to something that is objectively as non-offensive as possible. I do not want to get yelled at.\n I hope someone can share some insight, and recommend a distro that's focussed on GUIless, probably.\n    submitted by    /u/SomebodyInACity  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "The kernel thread ‚Äúinet_frag_wq‚Äù is created using a workqueue (https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v6.2-rc1/source/net/ipv4/inet_fragment.c#L211), we could have guessed it based on a workqueue do to the ‚Äúwq‚Äù suffix. It is used for fragment management of IP packets. Thus the goal of ‚Äúinet_frag_wq‚Äù is to reassemble fragmented IPv4/IPv6 packets (https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v6.2-rc1/source/net/ipv4/inet_fragment.c#L6).\n Overall, the goal of IP fragmentation is to split packets into smaller chunks in order to allow them to meet the MTU (Maximum Transmission Unit) requirement of a specific network. There is an implementation difference between IP fragmentation in IPv4 and IPv6. On IPv4 the information needed for fragmentation is part of the IPv4 header which in IPv6 there is a specific ‚ÄúFragmentation Header‚Äù (https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/ipv6-fragmentation-header/). An illustration of the flow is shown in the diagram below both for IPv4 and IPv6.\n Thus, ‚Äúinet_frag_wq‚Äù is relevant when a fragmented IP packet arrives at a specific system. The OS stores the fragmented packets in a queue and reassembles them before they are passing the data to the upper layers of the network stack. The fragment queue is represented by \"struct inet_frag_queue\" (https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v6.2-rc1/source/include/net/inet_frag.h#L66). \n Moreover, we can see in the source code the function ‚Äúip_frag_reasm‚Äù which is responsible for building a new IP datagram from all of its fragments (https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v6.2-rc1/source/net/ipv4/ip_fragment.c#L411). \n https://notes.shichao.io/tcpv1/ch10/, https://blog.quarkslab.com/analysis-of-a-windows-ipv6-fragmentation-vulnerability-cve-2021-24086.html \n ‚Äã\n ‚Äã\n    submitted by    /u/boutnaru  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I'm in the process of trying to organize my tools and I'm looking for a tool tracking software I can use to keep track of what tools I have, and where I've put them. For example, I know I've got a pipe cutter, but I can't find it because the last time I used it I put it away in this toolbox instead of that one. The next time I go looking for the pipe cutter, I might spend an hour looking for it or just give up and borrow/buy a new one. This is in an effort to de-clutter and organize my work area(s). \n I would prefer something other than a spreadsheet.\n Preferably I would like to be able to barcode label my stuff, so when I'm working on a project, I can scan the barcode, and it will tell me where I am supposed to put the tool away. Also, something that I can search \"Screwdriver\" and it will show me list of all my screwdrivers, where they are (or are at least supposed to be), and maybe have a picture.\n Most of the software programs/solutions I've been able to find are geared more towards business inventory that is to be sold/shipped/replenished/...etc. I don't need (or really want) a cloud solution, and I definitely don't want a subscription service - or really anything I have to pay for.\n Any suggestions? Anybody found a solution that works for them?\n Thanks!\n    submitted by    /u/raxxter  \n [link]   [comments]",

I didn't have a full backup so I decided to take the risk and install Ubuntu on the new SSD.\n I am delighted with the functionality under Ubuntu and Gnome, AND the stability of the machine has gone up to near perfect.\n Of course, everyone has difference experiences, but I wanted to share that you CAN win with using linux (Ubuntu) on a laptop over Windows... particularly for stability over Windows.\n Have a great day!\n    submitted by    /u/ReginaMulvinaLunt  \n [link]   [comments]",

I am in control of what I do; in Linux the majority of distros have no ads, and no \"reccomended settings\" that Microsoft tries to get you to use to sell more personal info. Trying to install Windows 11 got my computer in a boot loop and had to take out a battery underneath my gpu (I am very inexperienced with the physical side of computers) so I have given up hope for Windows. I will still have a Windows 10 VM for special windows apps that don't work with Wine - but Linux is getting a lot more recognition than it had in the past.\n    submitted by    /u/GoofyGooberForgor  \n [link]   [comments]",

I've even maintained a few Linux web servers but didn't do anything special to configure them.\n ¬†\n Even in IT, everyone is convinced that you need to be big brained to have anything to do with Linux so there aren't tons of people out there that know how to use it. It makes me wonder what I would have to learn to pivot into being a system admin or something. I don't know.

I have also installed dropbear to remotely unlock the disk after reboot via SSH.\n Sometimes the power goes out and my server will reboot after getting power again but stops booting as the decryption password will be needed.\n I want to automate the process by providing the server with the decryption password over network. First i wrote a script which tries to unlock the system remotely every couple of minutes via cron. This works but is not a very good solution.\n I want a solution where the server pulls the password from another server automatically. \n How would i go about writing an initramfs script which tries to access another server, pull the password from there and unlock itself via that password?\n Or does it make sense to try to alter the dropbear initramfs files so that it pulls the password from another server. https://ubuntu.pkgs.org/22.04/ubuntu-universe-amd64/dropbear-initramfs_2020.81-5_all.deb.html \n I can not use a UPS and i do not want to save the password in plaintext on the machine itself for obvious reasons.\n    submitted by    /u/DiscountCode1212  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I have been a Linux user since the year 2019. I used to run Linux on my all-in-one PC, which had an Intel CPU without any dedicated GPU. The experience there was perfect; I had zero complaints with any of the distributions I tried, but the story changed when I recently bought a gaming laptop with an RTX 3050.\n As expected, the first thing I did was to remove Windows and try to install Fedora on it. At first, the live USB wouldn't even boot because of the missing GPU drivers, so I tried the safe graphics mode, and then, after completing the install, I added the Nvidia drivers. In the beginning, it worked fine, but after some time, performance issues started to occur. Sometimes the OS freezes on the login screen or gives me a blank screen after I enter my password and press enter.\n I was determined that I wanted to use Linux because I like the playing around and freedom that it gives the user, so I tried other distros based on Fedora, RHEL, Ubuntu, and even Arch. I tried different DEs and switched between X11 and Wayland, but everything always gave me some kind of performance dip or left my laptop unresponsive just because of the GPU.\n In the past, when I used Linux on my PC and an old laptop that didn't have a GPU, it always worked fine, but now I am forced to use Windows just because Nvidia has a shitty Linux support.\n At this point I am tired of trying to configure everything by myself and yet getting no results, but I really want to move away from windows so if you guys got any suggestions, I am open to that.\n    submitted by    /u/sexysenpailoves69  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Here's my issue, every time i work on the look of my computers i end up having to propagate changes to a ton of files. Usually while programming you'd want your data that's used in multiple places to be anchored to variables.\n I'm kinda struggling to find a general purpose way of transfering colors, fonts, sizes, across very different applications i.e. terminal, i3config, gtk...\n I'm not a top notch programmer but i'm not an idiot either. I've mulled over the issue for a little while and would like opinions before commiting to what i'd consider to be a sizeable amount of work.\n I'm not comming here empty handed either.\n Take the terminal for instance: gogh has a build process that uses yaml for theme definitions, python for generation/building and bash for installation. It would be pretty easy to use/hijack the build process by simply generating a yaml def.\n For anything that's css-like: a tool like sass or similar is perfect, i'd just have to include my variables. I've seen a couple gtk themes using this.\n Any other configuration that uses text files should be trivial, i'm just uncertain what would be the least painful approach.\n Preprocessing options i've been coming across are: - awk / sed - probably the most painful approach imo - gpp - first time using it but seems to be a good powerful solution - node using gulp or grunt and whatever other rendering tool - i have some experience with this toolset but i feel it's not suited for the task and at this point any programming language that has printf/template strings would give the same result.\n What i'm considering is using make to process sources into a build/staging folder and then letting each 'facet' of themeing run their own build processes if needed.\n So what approach have you been using to tackle this problem?\n    submitted by    /u/Nulltan  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "For years, the tearing protocol has been one of the most controversial features regarding Wayland. Competitive gamers didn't want forced vsync for latency reasons so they kept using Xorg, and many many posts have been made regarding this situation. Only recently it was merged into the Wayland protocol but seemengly no compositor was using it.\n After updating my system about a week ago (notably with the new Nvidia 535 driver), I launched Nier Automata with direct scanout enabled in Hyprland's config file and... surprise! There's no forced vsync and I can notice tearing. I decided to test League of Legends too and it definitely works, I can now uncap my framerate and get it to ~400fps, but if it drops below my monitor's refresh rate (144Hz) tearing is noticeable.\n So... isn't this supposed to be a big thing?

The theory is these drives have custom firmware, but I believe it's just as simple as a serial number pair for the drives and dock, plus a 256 bit SATA drive password.\n Installing one of these drives in a PC and attempting to boot from it results in a password prompt. The first 4,096 sectors are supposedly reserved and cannot be read by the host PC over USB. Some people have reported certain Linux tools would allow them to reset the SATA password but I'm not sure this is true. Others have claimed \"true\" drive cloners could access and dump these reserved sectors, assuming that is true as well.\n This video discusses it but it's nearly a decade old, when these products were relatively new. Has anyone made any tools to dump these sectors, reset the SATA passwords, or do a more complete wipe of these cartidges to make them usable as standard SATA drives?\n https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymEB0Ay8QTo\n    submitted by    /u/Titan_91  \n [link]   [comments]",

AutoHotkey I've used for a while, it does allow creating UI's, but it feels wrong. It's not cross-platform.\n What would you consider a good solution or stack to create similar functionality?\n What functionality? Good question. AutoHotkey and AutoKey let you remap, input devices. I'm not going to say all input devices, but it seems possible. So you hit Mouse4 on your mouse and that could do anything, like press, (Ctrl+~ ; htop) for a quick htop macro if using something like a quake-mode terminal. You do have to manually type each macro by hand. So asking what functionality is it just letting the user type some hotkey in a text file, or is it a UI letting them record a macro, ala vim style.\n I'd rather it be easier for the user and they can choose, a UI or CLI + user created macro file, both options able to be used on demand.\n I'm sure I could name any language or libs/stack and someone could find a way to create it using that. What would you suggest?\n EDIT:\n Came across a post mentioning Python as a possible replacement for AutoHotkey and how it's faster to create a UI. It's not about that for me or this project. The primary goal is cross-platform OSS, if it can't do that, it's not comparable. To me the only difficulty would be finding a library that already has the ability to accept any form of user input from any input device. If the language doesn't offer that, then that language is not an option as this isn't a driver-level project.\n What about something like QMK firmware found on some advanced keyboards? If you know what I just said, fist bump. If you're familiar with Steam Input and how that lets you configure controllers, that's a bit like QMK firmware. That's the goal, to let the user be able to do anything with their devices. I'm ignorant if some library like that exists, you think a gamedev would be able to better answer the question?\n    submitted by    /u/blitz4  \n [link]   [comments]",

This lead me to a deep rabbit hole of repeated warnings that there is no way to securely do lock screens on X11. Here is an example https://blog.martin-graesslin.com/blog/2015/01/why-screen-lockers-on-x11-cannot-be-secure/\n Majority of the complaints repeat the following as some of the primary reasons\n  \nX has no concept of screen lockers.\n A screen locker is just another client for X.\n There is no privileged process which acts as the one and only screen locker\n If the locker crashes you have access to the machine.\n On X11: it‚Äôs not possible to prevent that other windows grab screen content. (This is something that Wayland can solve that X11 never can)\n  \nMy questions is why don't display managers take on the task of locking sessions.\n For instance I use LightDM. It seems to run as root, and is what is starting the X server for me.\n If LightDM (or any similar display manager) had a concept of locking sessions, then wouldn't that solve most problems.\n  \nThe display manager could just lock the current session in a given VT\n It will then switch/redirect users to a different VT where the password dialog shows up (this is a different process).\n On successful authentication we can notify the original DM process to unlock the session.\n  \nLight-locker seems to operate similarly, but LightDM itself does not really seem to know anything about it.\n Obviously we still cannot prevent 5. which is inherent to Xorg, but if I don't care about 5. I don't see why display managers can't do this?\n    submitted by    /u/vikigenius  \n [link]   [comments]",

After 1 year (maybe more) I take back my mac and it didn't started without power supply (in the meanwhile nobody used it). Tried to take in charge it for several hours, but not changed, the battery was KO. \n In add to this, few weeks ago I installed Fedora on my macbook, because MacOS was really slow. The OS works flawlessly, but of course nothing changed regarding the battery (need the power supply to turn on). \n Last week I bought a non-original battery (a good one, considering the price - I hope :D) but what happens now is that my macbook still do not turn on without power supply, but immediately after the apple logo come up, I can pull off the charger and the macbook go on with its own battery. The strange things: \n - Fedora do not recognize the battery (tried by terminal), also if in that moment it's working with that \n - The mac wants the power supply just to turn on (with just the battery it doesn't start). \n Already tried few SMC reset but nothing changed. Also tried another battery, but got the same result. \n What it could be? Do you have any recommendations? \n Thank you in advance. \n    submitted by    /u/rainbowsixjjj  \n [link]   [comments]",

Now, you can easily compare the availability of custom Android ROMs, custom recoveries, and Linux distributions between devices.\n What is Customrombay?\n Customrombay is the largest database of custom ROMs, with support for over 550 devices. Our goal is to support as many custom ROMs and devices as possible and provide quality information about them.\n Contributing\n Contributing to Customrombay is highly encouraged, as it helps the project grow. More information is available on the contributing page.\n Open source\n Customrombay.org is completely open source. You can find us on GitHub. Our code is licensed under the MPL-2.0 license.\n Phones with notable Linux support\n For now, only information about Ubuntu Touch support is available on our website. We plan to extend that to PostmarketOS and NixOS. But which devices does Ubuntu Touch support? For example those:\n  \nOnePlus 6 (enchilada)\n OnePlus 6T (fajita)\n OnePlus One (bacon)\n Xiaomi Poco F1 (beryllium)\n Xiaomi POCO X3 (surya)\n Sony Xperia X (suzu)\n Google Pixel 3a (sargo)\n ASUS Zenfone Max Pro M1 (X00TD)\n  \n   submitted by    /u/Piotr_Lange  \n [link]   [comments]",

Long story short, are the major and/or critical differences between RHEL 8 and RHEL 9 learning material?\n    submitted by    /u/9th_YearlyAccount  \n [link]   [comments]",

Red Hat never offered binary packages outside their own RHEL distribution channels.\n RHEL's unique value proposition is being well tested, stable, and standards compliant, with bug fixes delivered ASAP. Red Hat invests lots of money, time, effort to deliver this in RHEL, whereas the RHEL clones don't offer added value beyond being cheaper. I find it hard to argue: 1) any user has a right to a continuous stream of updates, especially where 2) that user is seeking to wipe away any return on Red Hat's investment.\n Second, Red Hat is a business, and we need to stop pretending every FOSS business should be some quasi-public trust.

At first I thought it was unnecessary because I already have a high-end computer, but this innocent wrong gift literally changed my life.\n For being low-end, Windows 10 was running very poorly, and I decided to install Ubuntu just for testing, and man... how freakin awesome Linux is! At first it's kinda hard because you don't even know cd or apt , but the more you try stuff, the more you learn how to do things efficiently, and even more important, you learn how to actually solve problems by yourself.\n Yesterday I changed GNOME for KDE, and holy ****, it's a new world of customization, and I just can't get enough of this feeling of exploring a whole new land. Even when I get frustrated after failing multiple times trying to do something, the thirst for overcoming challenges seems endless!\n I don't know if I'm being crazy for thinking that exploring an OS is thrilling, but I just feel like an 7 years old kid learning how to do things on a computer for the first time, but in a very depth/technical way (at least in my head lol).\n After this awesome experience, I finally decided to go for a computing college, and I just can't thank my mother enough for giving me a shi*** computer lol.

However, it has several limitations: a) it requires the use of L2 distance for efficient clustering, which also b) restricts the data you're clustering to be vectors, and c) doesn't require the means to be datapoints in the dataset.\n Unlike in k-means, the k-medoids problem requires cluster centers to be actual datapoints, which permits greater interpretability of your cluster centers. k-medoids also works better with arbitrary distance metrics, so your clustering can be more robust to outliers if you're ‚Ä¶",

Is this still true?\n ‚Äã\n My main monitor is 1440p 144hz but I also use my older 1080P 75hz panel as a secondary display. Are the issues with Nvidia in this case bad enough to warrant a switch to an AMD card? I don't mind getting a new RX 6800XT since they are available for around $500.\n ‚Äã\n Any insights would be appreciated.\n ‚Äã\n Edit: Forgot all about another major issue. I had to undervolt my GPU and put a custom fan curve on Afterburner to keep temps under 80c. It is a Zotac dual fan with underwhelming cooling. Ambient temps where I live can go as high as 32c in summer.

I have a Radeon RX 6600 XT that I got for a good price a couple months ago but it still waiting to be used until I get everything else to build this system.\n One motherboard that I've come across that appears to meat my criteria is ASUS Prime Z590-A which is LGA 1200, which I found via:\n https://pcpartpicker.com/product/fwVmP6/asus-prime-z590-a-atx-lga1200-motherboard-prime-z590-a\n The problem is I am having a hard time fining good information of how well it might be supported by Debian 12, or Linux in general, so I would really appreciate any insight and guidance, as well as any good alternatives, including AMD boards. I just need similar PCI-E options as above (either multple x16s or one x16 and some x4 and/or x8 slots - I will only be running the one graphics card so one x16 is needed for that, I need other slots for a capture card and other hardware that are mainly x4 max.)\n Thanks.\n    submitted by    /u/blz8  \n [link]   [comments]",

Some details: * I am fully self-taught * I don't have college * I have several courses on udemy (I don't know if it helps) * I'm autistic, and linux is my hyperfocus since 2005, I love it deeply. * I like to write documentation and organize scripts etc...\n A peculiar detail is that, as I am autistic, I cannot work outside the home, that is, it needs to be remotely because I cannot go out and be locked up somewhere (I have panic attacks)\n english Well, what would be your tip to put on my resume?\n I am Brazilian.\n    submitted by    /u/linuxerSl  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hey Reddit community,\n I'm in a dilemma and need your advice. I'm looking for a Linux distribution that prioritizes bug fixes and provides quick security updates without focusing too much on additional features. After some research, I've narrowed down my options to Fedora and Ubuntu LTS, but I'm having trouble deciding which one would be the better choice.\n On one hand, Fedora is known for its cutting-edge nature and frequent updates, which could potentially mean faster bug fixes and security patches. However, the rapid pace of development may also introduce new bugs or stability issues.\n On the other hand, Ubuntu LTS (Long Term Support) versions are designed to provide a stable and reliable experience over an extended period. They prioritize bug fixes and security updates while minimizing major changes, making them ideal for users who value stability.\n Considering my primary focus on bug fixes and quick security updates, which distribution do you think would be the better choice for me? Have you had any personal experiences with either Fedora or Ubuntu LTS regarding their maintenance and support?\n I appreciate any insights, opinions, or personal experiences you can share to help me make an informed decision.

          "description": "Apologies but asking here as /r/linuxquestions is still locked.\n I work for a private ISP, we sell managed networks to customers with various services. I have a VMware ESXi server, and to simplify things let's say it currently has 10 VMs, each VM having a management NIC, and a customer VLAN NIC. Currently I can use a service like NRPE to execute commands on each VM, and NRPE runs a networking command (like a cURL, ping, or similar) over the customer network NIC. The NRPE agent listens on the management NIC, but executes the commands over the customer VLAN NIC.\n Customer wise, for simplicity we'll say customers are called Customer1, Customer2, Customer3, and so on. Their VLANs correspond like 10, 20, 30, and so on. Each customer network has an identical IP space of 10.0.0.0/8, and the IP of this VM will be identical in each of the networks.\n I'm building a new VM which has a single management NIC, and a single trunk NIC (VLAN 4095 in VMware parlance). I've tested configuring the secondary NIC on the VM as Customer1 with VLAN 10 tagged, and that works fine (so the port is all good), but I'm having trouble with network namespaces. My end goal is to be able to run commands like ip netns exec customer1 ping 8.8.8.8 and get the results (quick crap example, but you get the idea).\n I tried to borrow the principles from this article but it wouldn't work for me. \n Update: Now resolved thanks to /u/J4yD4n suggestion of splitting the trunk interface in to separate per-VLAN subints and then attaching namespaces to them individually.\n    submitted by    /u/iDemonix  \n [link]   [comments]",

I just want applications that work.\n Let's be honest, one of the most common complaints i see about snaps other than load times are the fact that there's only one repository to pull packages from. And that's more than often commonly listed as the sole reason why flatpaks are \"apparently\" better.\n So why is it that flathub is the only repo that's list in every distro's documentation to enable?

It can\nallow local attackers to recover data used in string \noperations; \"If you remove the first word from the string 'hello world',\nwhat should the result be? This is the story of how we discovered that the\nanswer could be your root password!\" The report has lots of details,\nincluding an exploit; AMD has released a microcode\nupdate to address the problem.\n\nWe now know that basic operations like strlen, memcpy and strcmp will use\nthe vector registers - so we can effectively spy on those operations\nhappening anywhere on the system! It doesn't matter if they're happening in\nother virtual machines, sandboxes, containers, processes, whatever! \n\nThis works because the register file is shared by everything on the same\nphysical core. In fact, two hyperthreads even share the same physical\nregister file.",

With this randomization, an attacker cannot know ahead of time\nwhere a vulnerable target will be found on any given system.  There are\ntechniques, though, that can be effective without knowing precisely where a\ngiven object is stored.

          "description": "Over on the Open Source Initiative (OSI) blog, the organization has announced the Open Policy Alliance (OPA), which is meant to bring together various non-profit organizations to help educate and inform US policy makers about open-source software and its needs:\n\nThe need to create such a program is more urgent today due to the rise of new regulations in the software industry and adjacent open domains around the world. Cyber security, the societal impact of AI, data and privacy are important issues for legislators globally. At the same time, the COVID-19 pandemic drove collaborative development to unprecedented levels and took Open Source software, open research, open content and data from mainstream to main stage. Moving forward, developing these important public policies whilst not harming the ecosystem requires an understanding of how the Open Source ecosystem works. Ensuring stakeholders without historic benefit of representation are included in those discussions becomes paramount to that end.\n\nThe OPA will focus on educating public policy makers on Open Source to inform their development and deliberation of new policy concepts. There are unintended consequences that come from a lack of understanding of how open collaboration works in practice. The OPA will address this as well as the historic absence of contribution from underrepresented groups. The interest areas of the OPA community will complement those of Digitable Public Goods Alliance, a UNICEF multi-stakeholder initiative with a mission to accelerate the attainment of sustainable development goals in low- and middle-income countries that OSI joined earlier this year.",
