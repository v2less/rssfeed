It’s basically like TurboRepo but without the task runner. The tool builds a dependency graph between packages, allowing you to do things similar to what you can do in TurboRepo, like \"only test the packages and the packages that depend on them, compared to the main branch,\" or \"only install dependencies for Package A and its dependencies,\" etc. I use native go tool to get dependencies and create dependency graph between the package.Nothing crazy but I feel it could be useful.\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41332011\nPoints: 5\n# Comments: 0",

Here’s a quick demo video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bf-xTsDT5FQ. If you want to try it out directly, there are instructions below.\nWith Moonglow, you can start and stop pre-configured remote cloud machines within VSCode, and it makes those servers appear to VSCode like normal Jupyter kernels that you can connect your notebook to.\nWe built this because we learned from talking to data scientists and ML researchers that scaling up experiments is hard. Most researchers like to start in a Jupyter notebook, but they rapidly hit a wall when they need to scale up to more powerful compute resources. To do so, they need to spin up a remote machine and then a…",

We’re Joe and Stopa, and today we’re open sourcing InstantDB, a client-side database that makes it easy to build real-time and collaborative apps like Notion and Figma.\nBuilding modern apps these days involves a lot of schleps. For a basic CRUD app you need to spin up servers, wire up endpoints, integrate auth, add permissions, and then marshal data from the backend to the frontend and back again. If you want to deliver a buttery smooth user experience, you’ll need to add optimistic updates and rollbacks. We do these steps over and over for every feature we build, which can make it difficult to build delightful software. Could it be better?\nWe were senior and staff engineers at Facebook and Airbnb and had been thinking about this problem for years. In 2021, Stopa wrote an ess…",

Arva uses an AI agent to automate the manual verification that every banking/fintech does when they get a new business customer. This is called “Know Your Business” compliance (KYB for short) and it’s a royal pain.\nThere’s a demo video here: https://www.arva-ai.com/loom , and if you’re curious to try it out for yourself, you can onboard onto ‘Arva Bank’ and see what happens when you upload some fake documents: https://platform.arva-ai.com/demo (but please don’t upload any sensitive documents!)\nWhat’s this about? When a business onboards onto a bank or fintech (i.e. applies to be a customer), a human analyst has to conduct extensive manual verification a lot of the time.

It effectively turns computer programs into Lego bricks, to be torn down into pieces and reused into something new.\nIt supports the COFF and ELF object file formats, for the x86 and MIPS architectures. It has been successfully used on Linux, Windows and PlayStation executables. One user report is on a commercial video game from 2009 with a ~7 MiB Windows executable written in C++: it was delinked without its C runtime library and then relinked into a new executable at a different base address, with no visible change in functionality, as a prelude to a decompilation project.\nUse-cases I've demonstrated on my blog include modding, making software ports, converting executable file formats, creating libraries... I've originally built this as part of a video game decompilation project ; I've been working on this over the past 2.5 years and recently it has started gaining some users besides me.\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41318133\nPoints: 195\n# Comments: 32",

          "description": "repository: https://github.com/shimodateakira/VirtualStorageLibrary\nHello HN, I'm excited to share a project I've been working on called VirtualStorageLibrary. It's a .NET library designed to manage in-memory tree structures, including items, directories, and symbolic links.\nVirtualStorageLibrary is a .NET library that operates entirely in-memory and provides a tree-structured collection. This library offers a foundation for managing hierarchical data structures, supporting items, directories, and symbolic links that encapsulate user-defined types  (generic types defined by the user). This library is not a file system. Instead, it was redesigned from scratch to create a more flexible and user-friendly tree structure. The library aims to make it intuitive to reference, traverse, and manipul…",

          "description": "Hi HN! We’re Towaki and Allen, and we’re building Outerport (https://outerport.com), a distribution network for AI model weights that enables ‘hot-swapping’ of AI models to save on GPU costs.\n‘Hot-swapping’ lets you serve different models on the same GPU machine with only ~2 second swap times (~150x faster than baseline). You can see this in action through a live demo where you try the same prompts on different open source large language models at https://hotswap.outerport.com and see the docs here https://docs.outerport.com.\nRunning AI models on the cloud is expensive. Outerport came from our own experience working on AI services ourselves and struggling with the cost.\nCloud GPUs are charged by the amount of time used. A long start-up time (from loading models into GPU memory) means that …",

MinusX is a Chrome extension (https://minusx.ai/chrome-extension) that adds an AI sidechat to your analytics apps. Given an instruction, our agent operates your app (by clicking and typing, just like you would) to analyze data and answer queries. Broadly, you can do 3 types of things: ask for hypotheses and explore data, extend existing notebooks/dashboards, or select a region and ask questions. There's a simple video walkthrough here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BbHPyX2lJGI. The core idea is to \"upgrade\" existing tools, where people already do most of their data work, rather than building a new platform.\nI (Vivek) spent 6 years working in various p…",

          "description": "Hello!\nI recently wanted to learn a bit about computer vision. Initially, I wanted to build something which could solve a jigsaw puzzle, but figured I should start with something (much) simpler, so I've built this instead.\nThis is a visual Sudoku solver which runs in the browser. It works by using OpenCV to identify and process the Sudoku grid, passing this to a simple ML model to identify the digits, and then solving the puzzle with a backtracking algorithm. The ML model was trained on the TMNIST data set using a model built with Keras, also a completely new area to me.\nIt's far from perfect, and doesn't like non perfectly lit or overly warped puzzles, but the main goal here was learning, which I did, a lot.\nAs this was primarily a learning project, I've tried to document my approach as much as possible, which can be found in this Python notebook:\nhttps://github.com/Taiters/sudoku-solver/blob/main/notebooks...\nI used Python while exploring OpenCV and training the models etc, and eventually ported this over to web (OpenCV.js + Tensorflow.js) to get something I could actually share with people.\nFeel free to have a dig around the source or play around with the solver!\nGithub: https://github.com/Taiters/sudoku-solver\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41299594\nPoints: 37\n# Comments: 10",

          "description": "tl;dr we built an embeddable stream processing engine in Rust using apache DataFusion, check us out at https://github.com/probably-nothing-labs/denormalized\nHey HN,\nWe’d like to showcase a very early version of our embeddable stream processing engine called Denormalized. The rise of DuckDB has abundantly made it clear that even for many workloads of Terabyte scale, a single node system outshines the distributed query engines of previous generation such as Spark, Snowflake etc in terms of both performance and cost.\nNow a lot of workloads DuckDB is used for were normally considered to be “big data” in the previous generation, but no more. In the context of streaming especially, this problem is more acute. A streaming system is designed to incrementally process large amounts of data over a period of time. Even on the upper end of scale, productionized use-cases of stream processing are rarely performing compute on more than tens of gigabytes of data at a given time.\nEven so, the standard stream processing solutions such as Flink involve spinning up a distributed JVM cluster to even compute against the simplest of event streams. To that end, we’re building Denormalized designed to be embeddable in your applications and scale up to hundreds of thousands of events per second with a Flink-like dataflow API. While we currently only support Rust, we have plans for Python and Typescript bindings soon.\nWe’re built atop DataFusion and the Arrow ecosystems and currently support streaming joins as well as windowed aggregations on Kafka topics.\nPlease check out out repo at: https://github.com/probably-nothing-labs/denormalized\nWe’d love to hear your feedback.\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41258276\nPoints: 79\n# Comments: 17",

Trellis transforms phone calls, PDFs, and chats into structured SQL format based on any schema you define in natural language. This helps data and ops teams automate manual data entry and run SQL queries on messy data.\nThere’s a demo video at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ib3mRh2tnSo and a sandbox to try out (no sign-in required!) at https://demo.runtrellis.com/.  An interesting historical archive of unstructured data we thought it would be interesting to run Trellis on top of are old Enron emails which famously took months to review.

You might remember an earlier WASM build[1] that was around ~30MB. The Electric team [2] have gone one step further and created a complete build of Postgres that’s under 3MB.\nTheir implementation is technically interesting.

          "description": "10 years ago I began working on Muki, a web-based MIDI and chiptune player which I eventually announced here on HN[0]. It was a fun weekend project.\nOver the years I received numerous requests from people that wanted more: more music, more features, more playable formats, you name it.\nEventually I began working on a complete rewrite of the app (this time for real), and, realizing that each year another chiptune or MIDI website went offline, I decided to start archiving them for preservation.\nToday, 10 years after the first release, I think it's finally time for the new, nicer version to hit the shelves. It's now called Pixeltune and yes, now you can actually turn down the volume. :)\nHope you like it!\n[0] https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=10305918\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41218811\nPoints: 13\n# Comments: 1",

          "description": "My child, 19, is clearly suffering from Internet Gaming Disorder. They are spending all waking moment on an online Roblox capture the flag game with god know who all. They are in a top ranked EECS program, think (Stanford, Berkeley, MIT, Cornell, CMU...) and the grades are not great.\nThey are not focused on internship, which is about to end, and I don't think they did a good job. I tried to help but they're just not prioritizing the work. When at home they are just spending time on the above game. It's hard for us to decide how much to push and how much to let go, in case it all backfires and makes it worse. I'm worried they are throwing this great educational opportunity away which will impact their entire future life and worse this develops into something even more serious that it already is.\nHas anyone else gone through this, personally or for a loved one, and has any suggestions?\nThank you!!\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41212099\nPoints: 41\n# Comments: 61",

          "description": "Almost exactly 1 year ago, I submitted something to HN about using Llama2 (which had just come out) to improve the output of Tesseract OCR by correcting obvious OCR errors [0]. That was exciting at the time because OpenAI's API calls were still quite expensive for GPT4, and the cost of running it on a book-length PDF would just be prohibitive. In contrast, you could run Llama2 locally on a machine with just a CPU, and it would be extremely slow, but \"free\" if you had a spare machine lying around.\nWell, it's amazing how things have changed since then. Not only have models gotten a lot better, but the latest \"low tier\" offerings from OpenAI (GPT4o-mini) and Anthropic (Claude3-Haiku) are incredibly cheap and incredibly fast.

          "description": "Hello HN!\nThe day has finally come to stop adding features and start sharing what I've been building the last 5-6 months.\nIt's a bit of CrewAI, OpenDevon, LangFuse/Cloud all in one, providing devs who prefer TypeScript an integrated framework thats provides a lot out of the box to start experimenting and building agents with.\nIt started after peeking at the LangChain docs a few times and never liking the example code. I began experimenting with automating a simple Jira request from the engineering team to add an index to one of our Google Spanner databases (for context I'm the DevOps/SRE lead for an AdTech company).\nIt incudes the tooling we're building out to automate processes from a DevOps/SRE perspective, which initially includes a configurable GitLab merge request AI reviewer.\nThe initial layer above Aider (https://aider.chat/) grew into coding agent and an autonomous agent with LLM-independent function calling with auto-generated function schemas.\nAnd as testing via the CLI became unwieldy soon grew database persistence, tracing, a Web UI and human-in-the-loop functionality.\nOne of the more interesting additions is the new autonomous agent which generates Python code that can call the available functions.\nUsing the pyodide library the tool objects are proxied into the Python scope and executed in a WebAssembly sandbox.\nAs its able to perform multiple calls and validation logic in a single control loop, it can reduce the cost and latency, getting the most out of the frontier LLMs calls with better reasoning.\nBenchmark runners for the autonomous agent and coding benchmarks are in the works to get some numbers on the capabilities so far. I'm looking forward to getting back to implementing all the ideas around improving the code and autonomous agents from a metacognitive perspective after spending time on docs, refactorings and tidying up recently.\nCheck it out at https://github.com/trafficguard/nous\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41202064\nPoints: 69\n# Comments: 21",

Built on WireGuard (a fast, modern VPN protocol), Firezone secures your team’s apps, networks and services using access policies synced with your identity provider. You deploy tiny, self-contained binaries into your infrastructure anywhere you need access, and your workforce uses our client apps to reach the resources they protect.\nHere’s a demo: https://youtu.be/QEv7dJwKMvo.\nHistorically, the tool used to achieve this has been the corporate VPN.

          "description": "I wanted to show you something I was hacking on for the last few weeks.\nI tired of sharing screen via Google Meet with 1-hour limitation, with Zoom and 40-minute limitation, etc. With paid Slack subscription. And often times I just needed to screenshare with no audio.\nSo I ended up with my own solution - no registration, low memory, low CPU, low tek 1 fps encrypted screen sharing. Currently sharing only the main screen (good for laptop users).\nIt's very raw in terms of infrastructure, since I'm not counting bytes (yikes!), everything works on my own dedicated server. But the service itself has been tested, we've been sharing screens for countless hours. All sessions last for 48 hours, then it gets removed with all remaining info.\nEvery new frame replaces the other, and everything is end-to-end encrypted so even server owners and operators won't be able to see what are you sharing.\nThere is also no tracking, except the main page - and I use my own analytics. Sessions are not getting tracked and never will be, and observability currently is not in place.\nAgain, this is a true one-person side hacking project I hope (but I have serious doubts) I might need to scale if it's getting traction to support more users.\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41173161\nPoints: 169\n# Comments: 57",

          "description": "Hey Hacker News! I’m Nikita, founder of Airhart Aeronautics (https://www.airhartaero.com/). We are building an airplane for people who don’t fly airplanes. The goal is to make flying as easy as driving a car—while maintaining a high bar for safety. Here’s a video that shows a bit of our hardware and quite a bit of our software: https://youtu.be/PGJUGUceu8A\nIn the US, trips that are 50-300 miles are almost all done by car because that distance is too short for commercial airlines and too far for public transportation. Thanks to the Wright Brothers we've had aerial transport for over 100 years. The US has over 19,000 airports, and large commercial airplane technology has developed to the point that the planes practically fly themselves. If we already have the infrastructure and the technolog…",

          "description": "I was fascinated reading through another recent HN submission about a highly efficient implementation of A* in Lisp, which got me thinking about how I could do something similar in Python. However, these kinds of pathfinding algorithms really need complex terrain/mazes with interesting obstructions to showcase what they can do and how they work. So, I started thinking about how I could generate cool and diverse random \"mazes\" (they aren't really mazes, but I'm not sure what the best term is). I got a bit carried away thinking of lots of different cool ways to generate these mazes, such as cellular automata, fractals, Fourier transforms, etc.\nThen it turned out that many of the generated mazes weren't actually solvable, so I spent some time coming up with various strategies to test and vali…",

          "description": "Hi Fellow Hackers!\nI'm happy to share with you KittyCal, an installable calendar web app I made over the past two months. Existing calendar apps often focus on scheduling and require many steps to create one event. KittyCal, on the other hand, removes hourly scheduling and keeps everything on one screen.\nHow does it work? Just enter your email address, and we will send you a pair of calendar links (blue and red). There is no login process, click the magic link or scan the QR code to access your calendar. You can then add the page to home screen and use it like a native app.\nLast year, I built a bare bones version of KittyCal for my partner and myself because we wanted a private calendar that launches instantly for casual note-taking. It's worked well for us since, and I'm hoping this multi-tenant version can benefit more people with similar needs.\nPlease try it out and let me know what you think!\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41153712\nPoints: 33\n# Comments: 15",

          "description": "Hi HN!\nI've created a CLI tool called \"ell\" that allows you to interact with LLMs directly from your terminal. Designed with the Unix philosophy in mind, ell is simple, modular, and extensible. You can easily pipe input and output to integrate with other tools. Its templates and hook-based plugins enable you to customize and extend its functionality to suit any needs. Check out the README for usage instructions and examples.\nI developed this tool because existing solutions often felt too heavy, with many dependencies, or they weren't friendly to piping and customization. I, on the contrary, wrote in almost pure Bash with least dependencies. Additionally, I found a lack of tools that could read past terminal output as context. Imagine encountering an issue in your terminal and being able to directly ask an LLM for help with a simple command—this is now possible with ell (see the demo video).\nKnown limitations:\n- To maintain simplicity and efficiency, jq is used for JSON parsing.\n- Cannot avoid curl to sending HTTPS requests. If only there were SSL / TLS support in `/dev/tcp/`!\n- Perl is used to handle terminal escape sequences because regex in Bash does not support looking around.\n- Markdown syntax highlighting is not perfect due to the need for streaming output. It relies on a simple state machine instead of a full parser, which may produce falsy results.\n- Other known issues are listed in Github Issues. Please help add more!\nI welcome any criticism and suggestions, whether it's about the idea or code!\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41138085\nPoints: 141\n# Comments: 47",

          "description": "Hi HN! We're a small team in Lille (France) who make synthesizers and MIDI controllers. We've just released a virtual plugin version of our hardware synth Anyma Phi, which offers a semi-modular environment with a focus on physical models, although there are several other kinds of synthesis.\nHere's a video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6efDQ9GmRpg\nWe're not pivoting to VSTs, it's just that it was a practical way of investigating several issues and helping us with the ongoing development of our upcoming Kickstarter-backed synth (Anyma Omega) and MPE controller (Loom), and a gift to thank our backers for the wait they gave to go through due to several manufacturing and production issues.\nI enjoy reading music-related entries here, so I thought I'd contribute this time and I hope it will interest some.

          "description": "Hey HN,\nTL;DR: We’ve launched a free version of our Shadow IT scanner to identify which SaaS apps are used in your company, who uses them, and if they have high-risk OAuth scopes.\nPhilip and I went through YC with AccessOwl in 2022. We started the company because, in our previous roles, we struggled to track all the SaaS apps, users, and granted OAuth scopes.\nThe Shadow IT scanner started as a small feature within AccessOwl, which manages SaaS vendors and user accounts centrally. But a standalone scanner would have made our lives so much easier in our previous roles. So, we thought, why not release it?\nAnd here it is: a free, standalone Shadow IT scanner!\nHope you find it useful :) The Shadow IT scan helps with:\n1. Offboarding: Employees often don’t report all the apps they sign up for, making it tough to track and secure these accounts when they leave, especially with the common SSO tax.\n2. Security: OAuth scopes are quickly granted but rarely reviewed or removed, leading to organizations unknowingly spreading their data.\n3. Compliance: Auditors need a list of SaaS vendors, which is hard to compile when employees sign up for tools independently.\nAny surprises in your scan? What features would you like to see in the next version?\nLooking forward to your feedback!\nFAQ\nWhat’s Shadow IT?\nUnauthorized SaaS apps within an organization not centrally managed, posing security and compliance risks.\nHow does it work?\nOur tool connects to your Google Workspace or M365 instance, identifies OAuth tokens granted, and maps them to known SaaS tools. Note: In this v1 version, it only detects apps using the “Sign in with Google/Microsoft” button.\nWho is this for?\nTypically IT and InfoSec teams, but in smaller companies, it may fall under the CTO.\nIs it safe to use?\nYes, reading OAuth tokens is standard for SaaS management tools. Data extraction only occurs when you initiate a scan. AccessOwl is SOC 2 Type II audited and GDPR compliant.\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41118468\nPoints: 17\n# Comments: 2",

          "description": "Hey everyone, I'm Ulysse, CTO at SSOReady (https://github.com/ssoready/ssoready).\nSSOReady is an open-source (MIT) service that lets you implement SAML single sign-on without ever touching SAML yourself. You just need to implement two API endpoints: one to initiate SAML logins and another to receive incoming SAML messages. And then you're pretty much done.\nHere's me setting up SAML single sign-on in under a minute: (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_HVtFkW8xCI).\nYou can use our service with whatever tech stack or programming language you prefer.\nEarlier in my career, I worked on SAML authentication at Segment. I've been pretty obsessed with SAML since then. In the depths of the COVID pandemic, I even wrote an implementation of SAML in Go to entertain myself (https://github.com/ucarion/saml).\nOver the years, I've gotten really itchy to build better SAML tooling. There just aren't a lot of great options out there. Almost no one seems interested in making SAML easy for developers. Almost no one seems interested in writing clear documentation.\nWe're hoping to change that with SSOReady. We've open-sourced our codebase on an MIT license. You can do pretty much whatever you want with the code. Fork us. Self-host us.\nWe've also made the product entirely free.\nWhy free and open source? We're focused solitarily on becoming developers' first choice for SAML SSO. If it makes developers' lives easier, it works for us. We expect to monetize in the future by building extra features that serve large companies with complex needs. We don't see any point to being secretive or squeezing dollars out of small companies.\nI'd be thrilled if you gave the product a try, and I'd be really grateful for any feedback on your experience.\nIf you have any questions or concerns, my cofounder Ned and I will stay active on this thread throughout the day. You can also reach us directly at founders@ssoready.com. (We really mean this! We want to hear from you!)\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41110850\nPoints: 174\n# Comments: 65",

          "description": "ThinkPost is an Interactive split-panel diagramming, draggable block-based note-taking, and brainstorming tool.\nI developed ThinkPost as a side project for few months now. \nBasic idea is parallel streaming of ideas. It's a desktop web app with a very scaled down mobile version just for support.\nWhole my career I had been working with startups and specifically early stage ones, and it's a big responsibility to devise a feature on our own, think deeply about it in different streams (logically, security, re-usability, platform APIs etc.) and even present distilled part of it to stakeholders (Often times non technical people). Even now I run backend/infra/mobile/qa/customer support/integrations for a healthcare startup, so stakes are high. There's a lot of self brainstorming in multiple streams and then there's also distillation process. I couldn't really work with single page notepads for that streaming process. We should be able to note down in split-panels, so there's space for parallel ideas.\nMany note-taking apps today single-paged have high-think-threshold (windows notepad/apple notes have very low-think-threshold), you have to think before you write in them, so not a good option for quick ideas. So built a platform specifically for everyone who can parallel stream ideas in split panels Textually (low-think-threshold), write as they like), Diagrammatically, Code-wise or even Quick Maths. And also move the idea blocks across panels or within! or Open a new tab if you want more!\nI'm personally a massive user of my app because I plan everything at my current job via this app, run meetings, self-brainstorm features, study requirements, visualize code-ideas, an develop this when I get time as well. \nAll completely free. Might run ads later.\nhttps://thinkpost.io - Try! no login needed.\nMore comprehensive introduction: https://zameermfm.medium.com/introducing-thinkpost-io-33df61...\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41094159\nPoints: 17\n# Comments: 2",

          "description": "Hey HN,\nI am building an open source platform to make on-call better and less stressful for engineers. We are building a tool that can silence alerts and help with debugging and root cause analysis. We also want to automate tedious parts of being on-call (running runbooks manually, answering questions on Slack, dealing with Pagerduty).\nHere is a quick video of how it works: https://youtu.be/m_K9Dq1kZDw\nI hated being on-call for a couple of reasons:\n* Alert volume: The number of alerts kept increasing over time. It was hard to maintain existing alerts. This would lead to a lot of noisy and unactionable alerts. I have lost count of the number of times I got woken up by alert that auto-resolved 5 minutes later.\n* Debugging: Debugging an alert or a customer support ticket would need me to gain…",

We’re Asankhaya and Rohan and we are building Patchwork.\nPatchwork tackles development gruntwork—like reviews, docs, linting, and security fixes—through customizable, code-first 'patchflows' using LLMs and modular code management steps, all in Python. Here's a quick overview video: https://youtu.be/MLyn6B3bFMU\nFrom our time building DevSecOps tools, we experienced first-hand the frustrations our users faced as they built complex delivery pipelines. Almost a third of developer time is spent on code management tasks[1], yet backlogs remain.\nPatchwork lets you combine well-defined prompts with effective workflow orchestration to automate as much as 80% of these gruntwork tasks using LLMs[2]. For instance, the AutoFix patchflow can resolve 82% of issues flagged by semgrep using gpt-4 (o…",

There's a demo video at https://www.loom.com/share/10067c49e4424b949a4b8c9fd8f3b12c?..., as well as example search results on our homepage.\nWe’re both physicists, and one of our biggest frustrations during grad school was finding research — There were a lot of times when we had to sit down to scope out new ideas for a project and quickly become a deep expert, or we had to find solutions to really complex technical problems, but the only way to do that was manually dig through papers on Google Scholar for hours. It was very tedious, to the point where we would often just skip the careful research and hope for the best. Sometimes you’d get burned a few months…",

That doesn’t seem like that many.\nI set out to build a MacOS app to remind me when a full moon occurs, so that I could take a moment and step outside to appreciate it.\nThe MacOS app I ended up creating can be found at https://apps.apple.com/us/app/tiny-moon/id6502374344 along with the source code [0], all powered by the Tiny Moon library.\nI knew that I wanted the app to work offline, so working with a network request was out of the picture. Taking inspiration from SunCalc [1] and Moontool for Windows [2], I decided to create my own library and wrote Tiny Moon as a Swift Package to power my app.\nThe app tries to be as minimal as possible, does what it does very fast, and works completely offline.\n[0] https://github.com/mannylopez/TinyMoonApp\n[1] https://github.com/mourner/suncalc\n[2] https://www.fourmilab.ch/moontoolw/\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41069681\nPoints: 65\n# Comments: 18",

          "description": "Hi HN, we’re building Haystack Editor (https://haystackeditor.com/), a canvas-based IDE that automates the boring stuff (plumbing, refactoring, and finding code) so that you can focus on the exciting parts of software development! You can see a quick overview of Haystack at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2uZnR5D_cc!\n(It's currently only on Mac OS but we're working on Linux and Windows.)\nHaystack was born out of our frustrations with working in large and mature codebases, specifically with navigating and editing functional flows (e.g. the code flow for adding an item to the Amazon shopping cart).\nOftentimes dealing with such flows would involve navigating a maze of files and functions, and making any edits would involve a lengthy process of doing corresponding downstream/upstream plumbing.\nHaystack attempts to address this in the following ways:\n    1. It allows you to explore your codebase as a directed graph of functions, classes, etc on the canvas. We feel like this better fits how your mind understands your codebase and helps you find and alter functional flows more intuitively. We especially want to utilize this for pull request reviews!\n\n    2. It has a navigational copilot that makes edits across files or functions much easier. After you make some changes, Haystack will try to predict your next action and create functions/methods or refactor upstream/downstream code for you. Haystack will surface these speculative edits on the canvas in a way that you can easily dismiss or incorporate them, allowing you to make large changes with a few clicks or keystrokes.\n\n    3. Haystack will utilize natural language search so you don’t have to play “Where’s Waldo” to find a functional flow in your codebase. This is coming soon!\n\n\nPSA: Since Haystack is a VS Code fork, you should be able to move your extensions and keyboard shortcuts. Please let us know if you have any issues with this!\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41068719\nPoints: 86\n# Comments: 44",

Maybe it’ll help someone, or at least give you a good laugh.\n So, I’ve got a Bluetooth mouse and a Bluetooth keyboard. But, as it turns out, during the Ubuntu installation, they’re pretty much useless because the keyboard won’t connect. I ended up stuck on the screen where you need to enter your username, computer name, and password. And that’s when I realized—without a keyboard, I’m totally screwed. 🤦‍♂️\n After digging through some old boxes, I managed to find an ancient wired mouse—my savior (well, almost). The first steps of the installation, like choosing the language and localization, went smoothly, but then came the part where I had to type stuff… and that’s where things got tricky.\n I started frantically Googling for a solution on my phone, and then I accidentally noticed that I could highlight the text labels in the form fields. Right-clicked, and boom—there were options to “Copy” and “Paste.” That’s when it hit me! I started copying and pasting letters and words from these labels to fill in all the fields.\n One letter at a time, one symbol at a time, but I finally made it through the installation! 😅\n Afterward, I managed to get the Bluetooth keyboard working, and everything was fine. But this experience is something I’ll definitely remember for a long time.\n So, if anyone ever finds themselves in a similar mess—don’t give up! There’s always a way out. And big thanks to my old wired mouse for saving the day. 🖱️\n    submitted by    /u/Ktyby  \n [link]   [comments]",

I used Linux a while back for personal computing, and really wanted to make the switch again. I'm not really a fan of a lot of things that MS is doing (like the forced CoPilot) and figured I would be just a productive on Linux (I chose Kubuntu). Unfortunately, after many hours, I just am not.\n My role is that of an analyst and ad-hoc (not production) dev. For tasks like coding and SQL queries, and our web-based front end tools, Linux is fine. Not really any better than Windows, but not holding me back. However, my org is heavy into the MS ecosystem, and that's where the issues arise. \n Web based office sucks. It's workable for basic word and excel tasks, so I figured I could use that and a VM for more complex tasks. Which I could, but it's nowhere near as seamless as on a Windows machine (where I never work on any Office docs in a browser). Web based outlook kind of sucks, and Thunderbird just doesn't offer the full outlook experience with the multiple calendars and inboxes I have to manage.\n The other issue is I would have to ditch Google Drive. Self-Host seems the way to go for this. There are downsides with this as well, unfortunately.\n    submitted by    /u/120m256  \n [link]   [comments]",

Please note this tutorial won't work on X11 (I'm pretty sure it should work out of the box on X11 on Intel graphics). This has been tested on Chromium 127, using MESA 24.1.6 on Plasma 6.1.4 Wayland and Fedora 40, using Intel Ice Lake graphics (10th generation). This will likely work for other Chromium-based browsers, like Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge, Opera, Vivaldi, etc.\n All you need to do is to enable the following arguments:\n --ozone-platform=wayland --enable-features=VaapiVideoDecodeLinuxGL,VaapiVideoEncoder --ignore-gpu-blocklist\n On Plasma, you can use the Menu Editor application to add those arguments to the \"Command-Line Arguments\" field (append them at the end), after that, all you have to do is to save your changes and restart your browser. On other desktop environments you might have to edit the Exec line on the .desktop shortcut of your browser, usually located either in /home/your_username/.local/share/applications/ or /usr/share/applications/ (you can use sudo nano /usr/share/applications/browser_name.desktop to edit the files there, or another editor with root support of your choice)\n To confirm it's working, you can install the intel-gpu-tools package for your distribution (sudo apt install intel-gpu-tools on Ubuntu, sudo dnf install intel-gpu-tools on Fedora, and so on) and run sudo intel_gpu_top, then, play a video and check in the terminal if the video usage percentage goes above zero.\n I hope that helps!\n    submitted by    /u/Cleytinmiojo  \n [link]   [comments]",

Works.\n Game performance? Equal or better in my case.\n I never expected to run into problems with python and i didnt visual studio works good too.\n Lm studio for local llms works a bit different and while on win it didnt see option for endless generation now\n it only generates endlessly and prompt itself which is weird but fine.\n a1111 and comfyui works flawlessly.\n Installing aps with command line is in my opinion actually less of hassle than uncheking million of ad boxes in standard win installators\n My only complain is that pop shop is a bit laggy but cosmic shop is there and works much better.\n In all my 60 days of using pop_os i only once needed to use my windows laptop and it was to play league of legends. And not playing league is in general good for mental health.\n So yeah I'm still amazed how different my current experience with linux is compared to 2016 or even 2019\n    submitted by    /u/N3Rumie  \n [link]   [comments]",

Without this step, the phone will keep disconnecting. On windows, if you do not select \"Keep Originals\", it will auto convert HEIC to JPG when importing using File Explorer or Photos App.\n  \nMount your iphone via USB\n  \nThere are many ways to do this and I can't remember how I did it. I don't have ifuse installed. Pair your computer to the phone. You might have to try different ports, different cables. lsusb to see if it's connected.\n  \nInstall gthumb.\n  \nLog out, log back in. Gthumb is great because it will only import new photos on subsequent transfers.\n  \nPlug in your phone. On the phone, you will meet pop up boxes. \"Trust\" your computer and \"allow\" photo transfers.\n  \nThat's it. Hope this helps.\n ps. Why HEIC? It's smaller than JPG.

I see that people starts to give linux a try, on my close circle, nontech people started to ask me about what could they miss switching to linux, and if it's worth it. Also checking YouTube lately I see insane amount of videos being \"let's try X distro\" or \"1 month with linux challenge\" (thats actually leaves linux in good spot). do you think that the desktop scene could get more love soon / actually become an option for regular user to give it a try ditching other OS options, and impact on the marketshare?\n At least for me it was a constant try-on and out of distros for several years, but with the latest changes (especially for privacy concerns), if nothing breaks within my OS for the next 6 months, I'd go full linux in 2025 (having all webdev tools available on my setup). Looking forward for your thoughts, and what you think is the missing piece / limitation that could enable a flow of newcomers to the system ;-)\n    submitted by    /u/greckzero  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Few years ago there was a project called winapps that made running windows apps. It seems to have been abandoned now and was kind of complicated to setup. A few days ago I came across a fork of the project which is actively maintained and is much easier to setup (it's still annoying to do but still quiet a bit easier).\n It It runs on docker or podman container of windows which you can RDP to access the container. It runs a VM but it's automatically configured by docker and runs very well. Runs even better than linux distros on kvm. It also integrates with the desktop(at least on GNOME) and I can also acess /home folder.\n I tried using it for office apps (word, powerpoint and excel) and it works very well. It officially supports adobe apps and a few more but I couldn't assign more than 4GB of RAM to the docker container so I haven't really tried it.\n It's a really great project and I'm really surprised that there is no talk about it on reddit or on youtube.\n Github Link\n If you want to set it up for yourself, the instructions are on the github link. Here are a few issues I ran into and how to solve them:\n  \nOn the installing windows step the host used it really really slow and it's much better to use an iso that you download yourself and use as such.\n While creating the configuration file change the value of RDP_USER to the windows username which is probably \"Docker\" and RDP_PASS to the password which is initially empty.\n To run the apps you need to start the container, go the localhost log out of windows otherwise the apps won't start. To solve this just create an extra windows user and disable auto-login.\n  \nP.S. I tried to upload it a few days ago but it didn't get moderator approval. It wasn't rejected either, maybe noboby looked at it. This is uploaded without any changes except the P.S.\n    submitted by    /u/greatbacon02  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Nowadays, Linux is very easy to use for the average user in popular distros. GNOME and KDE are excellent desktop environments, which has allowed many people to switch to a simple distro like Ubuntu or Linux Mint without missing their old systems. I have been using Linux as my primary system for about two years, and I've learned a lot. Broadly speaking, I've noticed two types of Linux users:\n  \nFOSS User: Concerned with open source and security.\n Just Works User: Only interested in a system that works.\n  \nBoth types of users are fine with me (though I identify more with the first). However, Linux's philosophy is very focused on open source and respecting user data. Now, here's my doubt (or fear): It seems that big companies are increasingly eyeing Linux, and we might see many Windows/macOS apps here, whether through Flatpak, Flathub, or something similar. I also see a lot of hardware support, but much of that is closed source, which doesn't align with Linux's philosophy. \n So, it appears that the mainstream market is starting to focus on Linux, but they don't care about its philosophy. And if the mainstream market turns its attention to Linux, the masses will follow. But the masses don't care about the philosophy (and I'm not saying that's wrong). It seems that this niche that was once free from monitoring and malware might turn into an environment just like the one we were trying to escape from. Smaller distros might have to shift to this new model as they see that distros less aligned with the philosophy, like Ubuntu or Fedora, will grow. \n I don't know, does anyone else share this doubt, or am I exaggerating?\n    submitted by    /u/GidiomGates  \n [link]   [comments]",

Even on relatively recent and performant hardware (My system has an i5-10310U) you may notice that things like loading web pages and opening applications are now significantly slower when running on AC power.\n Obviously, selecting balance_power will result in lower power draw than balance_performance, which should improve battery life.

The reason was partly Apple ending support for my (Intel) MacBook Pro, partly my frustration with the more and more privacy-invasive nature of more mainstream desktop operating systems in the year 2024 AD. For the latter reason, Windows 10 / 11 was not an option for me. I used a new notebook for this endeavor, not my old MBP.\n So, I started out where probably a lot of new users started out, by searching for \"most beginner-friendly Linux distro\" and ended up with Linux Mint, which as far as I know is a commonly proposed option for new Linux users.

          "description": "I used to use DWM before I switched to KDE Plasma because I like having a desktop environment that I don't need to take a lot of time to set up. I also switched because I think graphical user interfaces are often a much easier way of configuring things than editing a configuration file. It's so much easier to change my display configuration with a GUI than xrandr.\n One thing I do miss from DWM is having automatic window tiling. Right now I'm using the krohnkite plugin for KWin which kind of gets the job done but it's not perfect. Instead of the window manager natively tiling windows, the plugin uses KWin's tiling API. I can see windows floating after opening for a short period of time before the plugin arranges it into the correct tile. This goes against the Wayland philosophy of “every frame is perfect.” In contrast, tiling window managers like Sway and Hyprland have windows automatically spawn in the correct location with the right dimensions.\n Since plugins are buggy and not as smooth as native tiling, I think desktop environments should natively support window tiling. I know Cosmic exists, but it has that dreaded Gn*me look.\n    submitted by    /u/SaltyMaybe7887  \n [link]   [comments]",

It's a good thing.\n BUT... IMO there are so many distros out there that are essentially just trash.\n A large percentage of them have only minor changes. They may come with one or two packages installed by default, that you could easily install on any other linux system with a simple \"install\" command. Maybe they set a wallpaper, or a minor tweak to whatever DE they decide to use, maybe a different splash screen on startup etc...\n They don't truly offer anything unique. Nothing different about the development philosophy, they just make minor changes and slap a bad name on it \"Super Fast Extreme Linux\". Most of the time, they have terrible support and stability.\n To use an analogy. It's like searching for a product on Amazon, seeing 4 or 5 good versions of the product, and then the rest of the search is just filled with cheap Chinese trash.\n Freedom, choice, and the ability to make whatever you want is a wonderful thing. But IMO, all of the man power, man hours, and human effort would be better spent contributing to existing, unique projects that actually have something to offer. Instead of everyone trying to go there own way, just for the sake of going their own way.\n So if you're starting a project, please consider looking for one that is already out there that is heading in the same direction, and contribute to that. If we consolidated just a little bit, I think the whole community would be better off for it, and have more man power to get things done.\n UPDATE: Some of you seem to think I want to force people to do things and I hate freedom somehow. This is not the case. The post is merely a plea for other people to explore existing projects, to see if they could be happy aligning themselves with said project, in order to make further progress instead of working alone.\n    submitted by    /u/Wigglingdixie  \n [link]   [comments]",

Then, an app like KDE Connect can put its own stuff there to give you a car UI that looks like the phone UI.\n Of course, car manufacturers won't implement this because Linux phones are a niche thing and they haven't become mainstream yet.\n What do you guys think?

I’ve always liked doing things my way, that is, taking something that already works and modifying it to my liking. I’ve been using Linux for about 7 years, trying out many distributions. At first, I obviously didn’t really understand what it was, so I saw it as “a different system from Windows that runs on my old laptop without any problems.” However, since I’ve always liked computing (I currently study Computer Science), I decided to gradually learn how this “Linux” thing works.\n It all really started one day when I damaged my PC’s motherboard while trying to update the BIOS (I’ve learned from my mistakes). Since I needed a computer, I had to resort to an old office PC that couldn’t run any games and where Windows was too slow. So, I decided to really try and experiment with Linux.\n Since that day, I fell into a rabbit hole that led me to where I am today. For almost 2 years now, I’ve been using Arch Linux (i use arch btw moment) as my daily distribution and OS, and I can say that I simply enjoy Linux. \n I have a group of friends at university who also use Linux, and it’s curious how, almost unanimously, they use Linux but don’t like tinkering with the system much. They find the idea of spending weeks tweaking configurations to center a bar and add a certain animation boring, but I really enjoy it.

          "description": "A post recently suggested that Linux desktop has a lot of newcomers and Flatpaks are a good way to make a good first impression. Here's a very simple scenario suggesting the exact opposite:\n 1- Newcomer installs Linux\n 2- They open the GUI app store - that is most likely defaulting to flatpak - and install Steam\n 3- They try to add their existing external drive as a Steam library\n 4- They can't because sandbox\n Installing Steam and adding your existing library to it is the first thing a vast, vast majority of people they do on a newly installed system. It is not at all a good first impression that the first thing you do on Linux silently fails. No error messages, no indication why you can't add your drive.\n Most people don't know what's a flatpak, they don't know what's a sandbox, at this point they can't even Google for solutions because they don't know what's wrong. They have to:\n  \nFigure out Steam is installed as a Flatpak\n That Flatpak sandboxes applications\n That they need to punch a hole in the sandbox\n How to do that\n  \nall to just do something that's seemingly so simple.\n If you have spent any amount of time in Windows forums, I think you'll agree that most people won't be able to or be willing to Google their way out this issue. As a result, we get a flood of posts asking for help in irrelevant Linux communities.\n Unless Flatpaks are completely integrated in the desktop environment, e.g. you get a popup that asks if you want to allow Steam to access that drive when you try to add it, there's no way they're a good default distribution method.\n    submitted by    /u/Prestigious-Text9674  \n [link]   [comments]",

It's crucial for running Solana programs, making it a prime target for potential attacks⁠1⁠​\n 3. There have been some gnarly bugs in the past, like integer overflows and discrepancies between different execution modes⁠1⁠​\n 4. These vulnerabilities can lead to network crashes or even forks - yikes!⁠1⁠\n The Solana team has been patching things up, but it's a reminder that even in the world of magic internet money, we need to stay vigilant.

I've noticed a lot more people are talking about and trying out Linux due to the hatred of Windows 11, so now more than ever is a critical time to make a good first impression. I'm seeing a lot more videos popping up on my youtube feed of people trying out Linux for the first time, and in my opinion, flatpaks are mature enough to be promoted to Linux noobs as THE way to install software, and these videos would probably end more positively if we did. My daily driver is Debian 12 with almost all my software installed as flatpaks and I pretty much get no issues, everything \"just werks tm\". \n Flatpak's best feature is how easy it makes it to install software that's not on the official repos. When I first got into Linux, installing third-party software was my biggest pet peeve. Every time I went to a website, and the Linux install said \"add this repo\" it made me want to quit almost immediately, because doing this almost always gave me trouble, and I felt as though the more software I installed, the less stable my system got. With flatpaks this issue completely disappears. I can install and uninstall software with ease!

          "description": "I have a server running ten hard drives (WD 14TB Red Plus) in hardware RAID 6 mode behind an LSI 9460-16i.\n Last Saturday my lovely weekend got ruined by an unexpected power outage for my production server (if you want to blame - there's no battery on the RAID card and no UPS for the server). The system could no longer mount /dev/mapper/home_crypt which was formatted as btrfs and had 30 TiB worth of data.\n [623.753147] BTRFS error (device dm-0): parent transid verify failed on logical 29520190603264 mirror 1 wanted 393320 found 392664 [623.754750] BTRFS error (device dm-0): parent transid verify failed on logical 29520190603264 mirror 2 wanted 393320 found 392664 [623.754753] BTRFS warning (device dm-0): failed to read log tree [623.774460] BTRFS error (device dm-0): open_ctree failed \n After spending hours reading the fantastic manuals and the online forums, it appeared to me that the btrfs check --repair option is a dangerous one. Luckily I was still able to run mount -o ro,rescue=all and eventually completed the incremental backup since the last backup.\n My geek friend (senior sysadmin) and I both agreed that I should re-format it as ext4. His justification was that even if I get battery and UPS in place, there's still a chance that these can fail, and that a kernel panic can also potentially trigger the same issue with btrfs. As btrfs has not been endorsed by RHEL yet, he's not buying it for production.\n The whole process took me a few days to fully restore from backup and bring the server back to production.\n Think twice if you plan to use btrfs for your production server.\n    submitted by    /u/etherealshatter  \n [link]   [comments]",

To stop him, I decided to stop the sshd service I had started earlier. After stopping the service and checking the status, it showed: \"Stopping OpenSSH daemon. Deactivated successfully.

Let me explain.\n I live in a poor country with a bad economy, so people try to economize when they need to buy new hardware always when it's possible. This need to economize in the last 2 decades made people actively search for Linux notebooks because they are usually ~30% cheaper than the same device shipped with windows.

This can be very daunting to someone who has naver done this before, and even if you have it can be cumbersome and annoying.\n The experience of installing linux should be: - googling: <distro> download - clicking on for example \"installer for windows\" on the distros website - running the program they downloaded, which allows them to partition thiere drive and reboot into the installer.\n This even already exists for asahi linux on macos.\n Now I'm wondering why there isn't anything like it available on windows for different distros, atleast for like ubuntu, mint, fedora and the likes.

I wanted to share some joy of mine.\n I've been using Wayland with the Nvidia drivers and KDE Plasma 5 for a while now, but there were minor bugs that have been annoying me. The biggest ones for Kubuntu 24.04 are flicker in Electron applications and the application dashboard and KRunner randomly failing to open sometimes.\n Today I booted into a live CD environment for the latest Kubuntu 24.10 daily and installed Plasma 6 from the staging PPA and Nvidia drivers 555 from the graphics drivers PPA. To my pleasant surprise, everything is rock solid and smooth. There's no flicker, no tearing, and the only graphical bug I noticed was black folder icons in Dolphin.\n I'm actually seriously considering updating to this franken-OS in my main installation instead of waiting for Plasma 6 packages to land in the official repository.\n Warning! The Plasma 6 staging PPA is unstable and can brick your OS if you don't know what you're doing. I had to manually fix some broken dependencies by downloading .deb packages from Launchpad, so don't try this at home unless you really know what you're doing. The packages prepared in the PPA should soon land in Kubuntu 24.10 proper, though, before feature freeze in mid-August.\n Here's a screenshot:\n https://preview.redd.it/vgnwzc1sohgd1.png?width=3840&format=png&auto=webp&s=304f9b46ab2a2e9731dce44120e60b8076b917d3\n    submitted by    /u/Linneris  \n [link]   [comments]",

I also don't think maintainers are incompetent, I supposed they were and compiled their own version, that's why the issue -due to my misunderstanding - seemed weird. I have the utmost respect for maintainers \n A group of crackers started committing patches to xz repository, those patches, in a non trivial way, composed the backdoor.\n After that they pressured the xz maintainer to be co-maintainers and be able to sign the releases. Then they proceeded to release a signed the backdoored release.\n The signing the release was key in enabling the backdoor.\n Am I wrong about that? If that's the case, wouldn't it have been solved if maintainers compiled their own version of xzutils for each distro? \n I'm trying to figure it all out to counterpoint that it's not the problem that it's a free software project which caused the issue (given that invoking kerchoff's principle seems not to be enough)\n    submitted by    /u/roberto_sf  \n [link]   [comments]",

First blocked nouveau (the open nvidia drivers), then installed the Nvidia driver from the website! Not terminal. Then turned off secureboot at bios. For context I tried many terminal solutions, used ChatGPT a lot, and was stuck with my driver not working - error on start up: failed to load Nvidia persistent services. Tried different distros, kde was not even starting, and nearly gave up entirely. Super pumped I passed my first hurdle. \n As a note, I knew beforehand Nvidia would be trouble, but I need it for work. I also reached out to this board yesterday asking for help and my post was removed by mods. Very disappointed, as the accessibility of community support can be hard to find. Anyway, glad to be in the penguin squad. \n    submitted by    /u/nncyberpunk  \n [link]   [comments]",

I bought a new 1TB high speed NVMe stick to be my dedicated expendable beater. Can I simply split that between ZFS cache and swap, or does a huge swap partition have an overhead penalty? (I know ZFS cache has some penalty)\n Backstory - I want the swap to play with LLM datasets. 128GB RAM is nothing to them but swap performs fine for personal use. I've been asking Llama questions about the MPEG2-TS spec because it seems to have an excellent understanding of details that are normally hidden behind paywalls and old broken links. Coding LLM deepseek-coder-v2:236b is all hallucinations and even the all-ingesting Google has nothing.\n    submitted by    /u/k-mcm  \n [link]   [comments]",

MariaDB configuration is typically using not more than 1G of RAM max 99% of the time with occasional brief periods it uses 3GB (according to mysqltuner) so some swap is briefly used on those rare occasions. Every time I run top/htop the system is using about 1.2G RAM, 1.5G is for buff/cache and 200M free. about 650M is allocated in the 2G Swap file.\n I just started using Hetrix tools server monitor agent a day ago and I'm perplexed on this graph.

I was nearly tearing my hair out trying to get the most basic functions to work on it yesterday, and I genuinely got so lost and so stressed that I almost broke down into tears trying to figure out why it couldn't seem to remain focused on Minecraft's game window. I was so upset and pissed off that I formatted the partition it was on without putting a kind of important folder back where it belonged, so it's now lost forever (lol). \n I switched to trying Debian, which finished installing itself about an hour ago, and it's been an absolute dream so far. Everything I've tried to do has worked, it seems pleased to explain itself to me when it has an issue and then just lets me fix it. It just does what it's told and lets me get on with everything else. That Minecraft window that wouldn't stay focused or clickable no matter what I did? Works out of the box on Debian.\n So far it feels like Ubuntu is just Debian with 6GB of issues added in to make it more difficult and obtuse to use, which gave me an alarming sense of familiarity to the OS I just ran away from. Can anyone explain what Ubuntu is supposed to do that the Debian/GNOME 1-2 combo doesn't?\n    submitted by    /u/RadicalDadical7000  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I got a new Samsung phone recently and the default messaging app was Google messages surprisingly. I used it for awhile, enjoying the new features. But then I found out I can't select text in a text message? Fucking what? Turns out this has been an issue for pixel enjoyers for a long time. Being able to select text in a text message is basic MVP functionality, and Google still hasn't implemented it. \n Thank God for android and being able to switch messaging apps. I'd be losing my fucking mind otherwise lol. \n Samsung messages also allows you to create folders, which is so handy for separating spam/auto messages from important numbers. It's also just nicer to look at IMO.\n Anyways, android is the best. Thank you for coming to my TED talk. \n    submitted by    /u/CommunismDoesntWork  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hey everyone, while learning about Apple and Android ecosystems, I've noticed a lot of people talking about AirDrop as if it's some kind of magical feature, or how amazing it is to use a Windows computer with a Samsung phone. Well, let me tell you: Good morning! I've been using Linux for at least 6 years now and my Pixel 4 (which, according to a friend, is faster than a 14 Max) for almost 5.\n KDE Connect is an application developed for the KDE Desktop Environment on Linux, but it works on any Linux distribution, even with GNOME (in fact, it's almost better integrated). It also has a respective app for Android (I don't know about iOS but I don't think so).\n You can do everything with it: control your PC in real time, using the keyboard, scrolling, mouse input with a double tap to click, etc., send files using your home Wi-Fi very easily (from PC: right-click -> send to device name, from phone: share -> KDE conn. -> send to name), execute any terminal command from your phone, which allows you to do whatever you want with your phone (I use it to lock my PC, turn it off), and you'll also have simultaneous notifications, a shared clipboard (both incoming and outgoing or as you prefer) and a lot of other really cool things that I invite you to try.\n I wanted to tell you about this because big companies are selling what a group of developers created a few years ago, and they did it better and for free.\n Download KDE Connect and you'll see that's all you need to have an ecosystem between devices, so much so that even my Apple fan friends were speechless.\n    submitted by    /u/SushoFusho  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "There are plenty of native, OEM and third-party apps for creating shortcuts; from remapping the Bixby key, Power key double-press/press-and-hold, double/triple tap device back, One Hand Operations+, etc. And there are some famous (most of them deprecated) gesture apps, like GMD Gesture Controls, Air Gestures, and many others.\n I'm really interested in optimizing productivity using these kinds of shortcuts. But maybe I just don't use my phone enough, or I don't have a lot of apps that I use very regularly. Even my home screen is kept clean with minimal apps (I usually use search to get to what I need).\n So, looking for some ideas and inspiration, what do you guys assign to your shortcuts on your device?\n    submitted by    /u/VonLoewe  \n [link]   [comments]",

Don't even get me started on the design guidelines, which often aren't followed by the Google-made apps\n There are so many drastic changes with layout of the UI, APIs like the filesystem behavior and so on, and that causes huge compatibility issues with older apps and cross-version support in general, and also confuses the developers\n Again, I might be exaggerating, but that's what I feel about the recent updates\n    submitted by    /u/creeper828  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "The Wavelet app just got updated to version 24.05 with the following changelog: \n  \n Update AutoEq database\n New feature: equal loudness\n New feature: quick settings power toggle\n Removed broken virtualizer feature from legacy mode for Android 14+\n Significant reduction in RAM usage\n Improvements in connected headphone detection\n Add Hindi translation\n Translation updates\n Bug fixes\n \n  \nWavelet, if you haven't heard, is a really good EQ app for Android that has a pretty sizeable fanbase among enthusiasts because of its support for importing from the AutoEQ database. \n Its latest update adds an equal loudness feature that applies loudness corrections based on the ISO 226 equal-loudness contours. I wrote an article over on Android Authority that explains why this new equal loudness feature is pretty nifty. \n To celebrate the update, the developer gave me 100 promo codes to give away across my social media channels. Those promo codes were quickly snatched up, so he issued me another 100 to give away. After giving away some more, I'm left with 47 promo codes that I figured some of y'all might like, so here they are! \n Edit: The codes may have all been redeemed by now. There's no way for me to check, but that's what some people are reporting.\n To redeem a code, first open one of the below links, use Google Lens or something similar to copy from the image, open the Google Play Store app on your phone, tap on your profile picture, tap on Payments & subscriptions, tap on Redeem code, and then enter the promo code in the text box that appears.\n Promo codes 1-24 \n Promo codes 25-47\n If you want to know how to set up equal loudness in Wavelet, my article on Android Authority explains how. If I got anything wrong in my article or you want to add something, do let me know!\n (I am not affiliated with the Wavelet dev nor is this sponsored/a paid promotion. In accordance with rule 8 of this sub, I asked the mods if I could post this giveaway, and they allowed it.)\n    submitted by    /u/MishaalRahman  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "In this competitive smartphone market, where manufacturers are constantly trying to push better specs and frequent releases, longevity usually takes a backseat. Whatever corners are cut to keep pricing competitive also affect it. On top of it, smartphone reviewers don't usually talk much about longevity of the phone model.\n So, for someone getting a phone for long term usage, what are the things to look out for. It makes sense that flagships usually last longer due to better materials, more care and longer software support, but these things apply to mid-range as well as low-range phone.\n I am listing some things that I can think of. Please add on to this list, and let me know if I added something wrong.\n  \nOverheating issues - Phones that run hot are bound to damage its internal components…",

          "description": "Just received my FMD Moto tags and thought I'd share my initial observations.\n Moto Tag\n  \nLooks and feels slightly better quality, and certainly a much better colour choice.\n \nQuite a bit smaller than the Chipolo (although a similar size in the case I chose).\n \nAbility to adjust the ring volume of the tag within the Google FMD app (although high volume sounds quite a bit quieter then the Chipolo).\n \nHas it's own companion app and the ability to update the FW of the tag. You can also get the tag to play a sound directly from this app. It has a find tag button which then takes you into the Google FMD app - Chipolo doesn't have a companion app or any ability to update FW.\n \nDouble pressing the button makes your phone ring/play a sound so that you can locate that if you misplaced it - Chipolo…",

          "description": "TLDR: So far they've never worked unless they were near my phone.\n I'm moving 500km across Canada, with Toronto being the origin. I'd preordered a pair of Pebblebee Tag for Android's last spring and they finally arrived a month or so ago. So I packed the two trackers in different boxes when the movers were here to see if I could track the moving truck as it moved across the country.\n The movers finished loading everything early afternoon on Wednesday July 24th and so far they were last seen at 12:41pm on July 24h... The last time I was personally standing next to the truck my phone. Four nights later there has not been a single update and our belongings are expected to be unloaded at our new home tomorrow morning. I don't expect them to be located again until I once again stand newer the truck.\n The 'Find My Device Network' seems to be missing the 'network' part. It's just my phone, all alone tracking these. I was considering getting one of the Chipolo trackers that uses a CR2032 battery for our cat, since it'll be easier for her to escape outdoors. But what use is a tracker that can basically tell you one of two things: The tracker is within Bluetooth range of your phone' and 'The tracker is NOT within Bluetooth range of your phone.'\n These are seemingly useless and I can't believe I spent over a year waiting for these.\n    submitted by    /u/AshleyUncia  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I feel like this feature, has been so much abused on modern smartphones, that instead of small dslr in your pocket (consistently) you get small dslr ONLY in some situations. They smooth out soooo much, that the photo becomes water-painting, don't know where the fear from noise come from but this is ridiculous. If they could only add control for denoise in the camera apks, modern phones will become super strong (they already are with 3rd party apks tbh)\n BTW this is way worse then any sharpening method, ill take over-sharpened photo over smudged textures anyday!\n    submitted by    /u/Dazed811  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "So, just as I avoid modern Apple products, especially dislike IOS devices, I'm not a fan of Jony Ive. Seems like far too much form over function design for me. But he'll probably be remembered in 100 years as an iconic designer. Of course he's sadly (IMO) arguably quite heavily influenced many Android devices to go pretty form over function, too. \n I suppose there's a big divide between those Android users who really just want their device to do stuff well and those who really care about it's looks. Anyway, Android is so huge that you'd think at least one top phone designer would have become world famous? If not another iconic Android phone company head too, in a similar way to Steve Jobs.\n But I couldn't name, say, Samsung's head Android device designer, without looking it up, nor the CEO. HTC had pretty iconic premium designs (if you like that kind of thing), same for them. Unlike the Nexus, Google entirely design the Pixel themselves, don't they? But whoever designs them doesn't seem to have become famous at all. Why have (AFAIK) no very important Android people become famous? At least not in the west (different in Asia?)/outside of tech enthusiast circles.\n    submitted by    /u/TessaKatharine  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "前几天，去朋友工作的小公司溜达，朋友写前端，他身后一哥们写后端，看起来不到三十岁。我闲着无聊，就坐在后端老哥旁边，看他写写代码，不一会儿我朋友前端问题修改完了，打包项目发给他部署到服务器测试一下。这时候我看着后端开始了操作，他们用的是 Caddy Web Server ，于是后端就开始改 Caddyfile 文件：\n:2333 {\n   root * /var/www\n   file_server\n}\n\n:2333 {\n   root * /usr/root/dist\n   file_server\n}\n\n他简单的把之前的复制了一下，改了root路径，就打算重启caddy了。我说：端口也要改吧？他说：先试试。于是重启caddy，发现报端口重复的错误，又再次编辑Caddyfile，把端口改了。那一瞬间我甚至怀疑他是不是第一次写代码了，我虽然没用过caddy，但一个端口配置两个网站，稍微想想也不可能有这种操作吧？\n这件事让我想起几年前隔壁公司的一个女程序员 A ，因为大家一起下楼吃饭，也都比较熟，有一次 A 找我说：JS 有几个地方的代码报错，能不能帮她看看怎么回事？我过去一看，好家伙！一个类里面这样写着：\nclass Store {\n    function getItem(key: string) {\n        // TODO\n    }\n}\n\n我说类里面写函数为什么要加 function 关键字？她说好像有这种语法吧，她试了不行还以为开发环境哪里出错了！\n再说到另一个男同事 B ，这个同事是纯前端，完全不懂一点后端。有一次，他想试试用Node.js怎么读写数据库实现用户登录，然而编辑器却总是提示错误，我偶然瞅了一眼他正在摸索着写的代码，发现他在 JS 文件里这样写着：\nimport sqlite3 from 'sqlite3';\n\nexport function login(req: Request) {\n    sqlite3.SELECT * FROM users\n}\n\n我震惊了！函数里面都不是JS语法，这都看不出来？\n为什么我要说这几个事情呢，因为他们的情况真的太反差了。通过以上几个事情，不管是谁，第一印象都会觉得这几个人水平很菜。但除了第一个后端，后两个我是知道的。女程序员 A 和男同事 B 工作经历大概都是五六年了。\n女程序员 A 在他们公司干了两年，做的项目大概一二十万代码，她每天提交代码，开发能力肯定是够的，后面跳槽去了其他公司，据说干得也很好。\n男同事 B 参与的项目八十多万行代码（ css + js/jsx/ts/tsx + json ）,他参与需求开发和性能优化，平时的工作任务也没出过什么问题。\n你说他们水平不够吧，他们靠自己的能力完全能够应付日常的开发工作。你说他们厉害吧，有时候写出来的代码我甚至都怀疑他们会不会编程。（上面的几个问题，他们不是大意而犯错，是真的不知道自己写错了）\n真是奇哉怪哉！",

          "description": "站长如何选择博客平台?在选择博客平台时，需要综合考虑多个因素，包括平台的易用性、功能、自定义能力、社区支持、成本以及是否满足个人或企业的特定需求 http://m.bokequ.com/list/22-0.html\n　　以下是一些建议，帮助您选择适合的博客平台：\n　　 1. 评估平台类型\n　　综合性平台\n　　优点：用户基数大，易于上手，提供丰富的模板和插件，SEO 优化较好，有助于内容推广。\n　　代表平台：新浪博客、博客园等。这些平台适合博客新手或偶尔写作的人。\n　　开源博客系统\n　　优点：提供高度的自定义能力，可以根据个人喜好设计博客的外观和功能，支持多平台同步发布。\n　　代表平台：WordPress 、Typecho 等。这些系统适合有一定写作经验和追求个性化的博主。\n　　专业内容平台\n　　优点：提供更高的流量和关注度，有助于内容的传播，同时提供丰富的商业合作机会。\n　　代表平台：知乎专栏、简书等。这些平台适合专业写手或自媒体人。\n　　 2. 考虑关键功能\n　　自定义能力：选择能够完全控制博客外观和功能的平台，如 WordPress 。\n　　 SEO 优化：确保平台具备良好的 SEO 性能，以便提高博客的可见性和访问量。\n　　社区支持：选择拥有活跃社区的平台，有助于内容分享和互动。\n　　插件和主题：查看平台是否提供丰富的插件和主题，以满足不同的功能需求和设计风格。\n　　 3. 成本考量\n　　免费与付费：许多平台提供免费和付费两种选项。免费选项通常有限制(如广告、存储限制等)，而付费选项则提供更多功能和更好的用户体验。\n　　长期成本：如果计划长期运营博客，需要考虑平台的升级费用、域名和服务器费用等长期成本。\n　　 4. 用户体验\n　　易用性：选择界面友好、易于操作的平台，以便快速上手和高效管理博客。\n　　编辑器功能：特别是对于喜欢使用 Markdown 等轻量级标记语言的用户，需要选择支持 Markdown 的编辑器。\n　　 5. 特定需求\n　　内容类型：如果主要发布图片、视频等多媒体内容，需要选择支持这些媒体类型的平台。\n　　国际化需求：如果博客面向全球受众，需要选择支持多语言和多地区的平台。\n　　 6. 示例对比\n　　以 WordPress 为例，它提供了广泛的自定义选项、强大的插件生态系统和 SEO 友好性，但需要一定的技术知识和资源投入。而知乎专栏则是一个适合专业和深度内容创作者的平台，拥有广泛的受众和友好的用户界面。\n　　总结：选择博客平台时，请根据您的个人或企业需求、技术水平、成本预算以及长期规划进行综合考虑。通过比较不同平台的优缺点，选择最适合您的博客平台。同时，记得定期评估和调整您的博客平台策略，以适应不断变化的网络环境和市场需求。",

          "description": "最近刚刚折腾了一把，分享下我买美区 AC+的过程，也想问问有没有人在中国大陆/香港使用过美区 AC+的？使用的体验是什么样的？\n因为 Apple Intelligence 锁中国大陆的硬件，于是把原来的国行 AC+的 iPad Pro M1 卖掉了，找人从澳门伦敦人的 Apple Store 带回来了一台 M4 的 iPad Pro ，有小票。\n结果因为不熟悉情况，收到才发现澳门和香港的 iPad 还是有区别的，具体在于澳门的不能在 iPad 设置里面买 AC+，只能线下购买或者电话购买。\n先是尝试去拨打澳门的 Apple Support 电话，结果无法接通，退而求其次拨打澳门伦敦人店的电话，结果那时候他们还没开业，不在营业时间 w 不接电话。\n最终拨打了香港的 Apple Support 电话，接通之后发现只有广东话和英语，就选择了英语客服。之后的过程倒是挺顺利的，只是由于没有显示 this device is eligible for AppleCare+，客服让我额外运行并且上传了个设备诊断日志作为补充。客服还说按月订阅的方案无法选择，只能先买两年的。\n购买的 AppleCare+是与当前登录的 Apple ID 绑定的，我登录的是美区，所以收到的邮件就是美区 AC+的链接，点进去之后支付只支持美国发行的卡，无论是输入 cvv 还是直接 Apple Pay ，还好我有张美卡，支付顺利。这里还有个题外话题外话，当时我问客服港卡是否可以支付，她告诉我可以，结果最终验证结果是不行的。\n买完之后很快就收到了邮件，AppleCare+ Proof of Coverage ，另外买完之后如果你还有 Apple Pencil Pro 或者 Magic Keyboard 的话，需要把序列号也报给客服，她再做一次绑定。\n这次算是踩了一个坑，按理说我这种直营店买的有收据的也不会被刁难使用 AC+，不知道有没有人真的在中国大陆或者香港用过美区 AC+，是什么体验？",

A request that arrives sooner than 100ms after the previous one is put in a queue, and here we are setting the queue size to 20.\n\nThat means if 21 requests arrive from a given IP address simultaneously, NGINX forwards the first one to the upstream server group immediately and puts the remaining 20 in the queue. It then forwards a queued request every 100ms, and returns 503 to the client only if an incoming request makes the number of queued requests go over 20.\n\n结合代码和这段文字，我对 burst 的理解是：\n6r/m：以每 1 分钟为一个时间阶段，将这 1 分钟分为 6 段，即每 10s 最多接收 1 个请求，该 10s 内的多余请求将会被返回 503 ；\nburst=5：突发队列长度=5 。以每 1 分钟为一个时间阶段，在这 1 分钟内，该队列最多只能接受 5 个请求，即使该队列内的请求已经被处理，也不会往队列里新增新的请求，直到下 1 分钟到来。\n测试\n测试工具：jmeter \n\n预期结果：\n在 120s 内，一共发起了 120 个请求，其中请求成功 22 个(6+6+5+5)，其余返回 503 ；\n实际测试结果：\n在 120s 内，一共发起了 120 个请求，其中请求成功 17 个(6+6+5)，其余返回 503 ；\n为什么少了 5 个请求，希望大佬们为我指点下，谢谢~",

          "description": "自从去年 9 月公司散伙之后，boss 上沟通无数公司，几乎没有回复。本地有家公司给了个机会，上了几天班感觉不对，就没去了。之前在 v2 写了个帖子介绍这个经历。\n前公司散伙的时候，前老板让我想办法把我之前做的 UWB 定位系统方案卖了，给我分成。然后我就建了个网站，也在知乎上写了些文章。\n有不少人咨询，但是都没有下文，一直到 6 月份，才有一个公司表达了购买的意向，对方是国企，到现在合同都没签，他们还在走内部的流程。\n去年底决定做独立开发。打算做一个自动运维的软件，折腾了几个月之后，发现还是应该继续搞 UWB 定位。\nUWB 定位这个东西，我已经做出了一个完整的系统，还量产了，从技术的角度来说，也到了一定的深度。并且，在业内有一定的“知名度”，至少有不少人知道有这么个公司这么个人，在做这个事，效果还可以，技术也靠谱。\n我可以把这个作为自己的立足点。之前做的东西，知识产权当然是前公司的，但是，我可以继续往深处搞/往广度搞，可以重新做出一套不同的东西出来。例如之前的系统是上行 TDOA 定位，我可以做下行 TDOA 定位，还可以增加 TOF 定位等等。以后可以靠卖技术卖方案挣钱。如果有人买老系统，我就跟前老板分成，如果买新系统，就是我自己的。于是就把以前弄的东西又翻出来，开始做一些以前想做但还没有做的事，把 UWB 定位继续往深处搞。\n前两周，有个深圳的老板联系我，邀请我到他们公司上班。他是看了我在知乎上写的文章之后，大概觉得我还可以，是个合适的人选，所以联系我。\n对方是个做嵌入式的初创公司，目前只有几个人。如果我过去，是负责软件这块工作，大概算是软件经理吧。\n纠结了很久，从目前的情况来看，如果继续坚持弄 UWB 定位，收入很难保证。如果运气好，也许能挣点钱，如果运气不好，生活都困难。深圳这边如果上班，马上就会有工资收入。\n但是这个年龄(56+)还要去深圳，实在是有点那啥。。。。\n老板建议我可以先到深圳看一下，大家见个面，也到公司看看。然后我上周去了深圳。\n最终决定还是去深圳吧。我跟老板说，先搞 3 个月试用期，大家都有足够的时间做出评估。如果大家都觉得 OK ，就继续下去；如果哪方觉得不行，随时可以中止。\n跟老板沟通过几次，感觉老板是个技术上的大牛，一直在跟踪蓝牙标准，跟我谈到蓝牙标准有好多不足之处。虽然我对蓝牙不了解，但是感觉他说得比较有道理。老板的很多理念跟我相似，但是我不确定他是真的这样，还是投我所好。无所谓了，如果理念一致，大家相处会比较愉快；如果是投我所好，大家应该也会相处愉快。\n在过往的职业生涯中，很多次从零开始组建团队，看样子这次也是要从零开始咯。",

          "description": "起因\n自七月开始，手机开始陆续收到一些短信、贷款的推销短信。\n到了八月初，首先是接到了一个电话，声称我有一笔 “医疗补充金” 待领取。这种话术一听就是推销 or 诈骗，直接就挂断掉了。这个时候也没有特别关心，只是觉得推销越来越多了。\n之后的节奏就开始疯狂起来了，他们使用不同的短信签名发送内容大致相同但推广链接不同的短信。一会是信用飞、好分期、众安金融这些短信，一会又是通过不同的手机号码（非固定电话，全部是个人号码，但都是虚拟运营商）进行骚扰。以近乎每日一条甚至两三条的频率疯狂推送短信，电话则是每周能接到两到三次。\n我的号码会在工作中使用，短信尚且可以编辑规则屏蔽，但电话无能为力。来电的号码归属地哪里都有，除了都是虚拟运营商外，没有其他规律。\n端倪\n虽然短信签名不同，但他们使用的短链接大多相似。比如他们使用的一部分域名：\nkg1.cn\ngh1.cn\nqw7.cn\n8rf.cn\n这些域名都在近期内完成了 ICP 备案，并且来自不同的主体，大概是收购来的备案或域名。\n而贷款短信中的链接点进去会直接跳转到正规的小贷平台，跳转携带了 aff 链接。这些小贷平台会结算佣金，但不知道这条代理链条有多长，也拿不到相关的资料。\n无独有偶，在“医疗补充金”的骚扰电话来电后，也会收到一条签名为 “保单在线” 的企业所发的短信，使用的链接同样是与上述短信相同的 xxx.cn 格式。这个所谓的 “医疗补充金” 和 “保单在线” 其实已经被许多组织预警，可以查询到很多关于他们的信息。你点进他们的链接订阅了他们的产品后，他们会划走高额的订阅费用，大概率是针对不会操作取消订阅的群体。\n如图：\n滥发 106 短信，电话语音诱导诈骗别人订阅产品，听起来比较老的手段，今天仍然还在。\n最后\n其实在今天，骚扰短信和电话早就算是一件小事。我们的数据、信息早已被链条上的既得利益者传的满天飞。但见到这种程度的骚扰，终究还是令我比较担忧。\n我们作为每天耳濡目染这些圈套的人，也只能堪堪应对。很难想他们通过这些手段欺骗了多少不懂退订的中老年人。可能像是我的父母一样，上了年纪也不会操作，只能吃了哑巴亏。\n即便最后发现并通过种种方式退订，早就不知道被划走了多少隐性费用，但又够不上报警的条件。这种事情更不会告诉在外工作的子女，就这样被骗走少则几十多则几百上千的费用。\n个人的力量终归太有限，我很希望能深挖这条灰色链条，但又苦于没有时间、精力，也没有足够的手段制裁。能做到这些多多少少依赖着灰产。很多材料还能深挖出一些蛛丝马迹。但真的，个人的力量太弱小了。\n很无奈，但我能做的也只是把他发出来。",

          "description": "如果一个人没上班或者处在下班后的时间，你跟他说，猪肉一块钱十斤，他肯定会觉得要么你疯了要么商家疯了，因为他的理智告诉他，几乎不可能有这么卖猪肉的。\n但是，一旦类似的情况发生在公司，情况完全就变了。\n我们以熟悉的互联网公司为例。比如面试，我们都知道技术注重的是实操，但是很多公司就是喜欢面八股文，不注重实操。再比如加班，明明没什么事做，早点下班休息，第二天精神饱满才能更好干活，但是公司就是不让走，哪怕坐着玩手机都行。\n这些事情，在任何有理智的个人看来，都是很无语的行为，但是公司就要这么做。为什么呢？\n如果我们把视角拉高一点，从整个社会的视角看，把公司当作劳改所，把员工当作犯人。这样一来所有的事情就变得合理了，员工进来就是有罪的，而公司的义务就是把“犯人”好好改造。\n公司说猪肉一块钱十斤，你说不对，那就“打”，“打”到你同意为止。（“打”表现为降薪、扣绩效、辞退）\n公司说你活着全靠老板赏你饭吃，你反驳说你凭自己的能力挣钱吃饭，还是“打”，必须得把你这种“病态”的价值观“矫正”过来。\n当你活干得好的时候，就给你改善下“伙食”（加薪、奖金），当你没干好的时候，迎接你的就是“打骂”。\n所以，我不禁想到：在公司这座“劳改所”里，与其说员工是在赚钱，不如说是在接受劳改。改造的不能有自己的理性思考，改造的要默默为资本家服务。\n所以公司，不是单纯的经济实体，而是资本控制人们思想的统治工具。\nPS：只是随便聊聊一些看法，有不同意见欢迎评论理性探讨。",

          "description": "The share of state-owned enterprises (SOEs) in Sweden's economy is not explicitly detailed in the search results. However, it is noted that public-sector spending in Sweden accounts for up to three-fifths of GDP, and in 2014, the percent of national wealth owned by the government was 24%. Additionally, SOEs are significant in various sectors across Europe, including Sweden, particularly in network industries like energy and transport. This suggests that while specific figures for Sweden's SOE share are not provided, SOEs play a substantial role in certain sectors of the economy.\n关于瑞典经济中的国有企业（ SOE ）份额，搜索结果中没有明确的详细信息。然而，据了解，瑞典的公共部门支出占国内生产总值（ GDP ）的五分之三，而在 2014 年，政府拥有的国民财富比例为 24%。此外，国有企业在包括瑞典在内的欧洲各国的多个行业中具有重要地位，特别是在能源和交通等网络行业。这表明，尽管没有提供瑞典国有企业份额的具体数据，但国有企业在经济的某些领域中发挥着重要作用。\n简直是国进民退的典范。",

          "description": "今天我们聊一聊电影。\n死侍与金刚狼\n昨天去电影院看了《死侍与金刚狼》，说实话这个电影一般，双方莫名其妙的打了起来，又莫名其妙的和好了。多元宇宙这个词，就像死侍说的，已经被漫威玩烂了，死去的英雄又复活，原来前一部设定好的剧情，这一部又被推倒重来。\n总结这部电影就是个爆米花电影，你就为自己的情怀买单或者无脑跟着死侍吐槽傻笑就完事了。\n在电影结束的时候，放了很多金刚狼拍摄的花絮，却勾起了很多逝去的回忆。\n金刚狼主演或者参演的电影一共有十部，最早的一部是 2000 年的《 X 战警》，后面《 X 战警》又出了很多部，再后来又为金刚狼为主线拍了好几部。\n休杰克曼与金刚狼\n休杰克曼，演了这个角色二十多年，在花絮里他透露，当他第一次定好妆容时，工作人员甚至问他：你是谁啊，金刚狼是长你这个样子吗？\n而现在，只要看到休杰克曼，就想到了金刚狼，看到金刚狼，就想到了休杰克曼，他演活了这个角色。漫画里金刚狼是个个子很矮的杀人机器，而休杰克曼演的，虽然脾气火爆，但是身材高大威猛，那一身的腱子肉，站在那里就让人望而生畏了。\n在血脉喷张的杀戮背后，休杰克曼赋予了这个角色更深邃的层次，他迷茫，痛苦，矛盾，思索人生的意义，思考爱情的真谛，他渴望爱人，又害怕爱人，他想要亲情，却又害怕 失去。表面漠不关心，背地里却总是为团队做的牺牲最大的那个，就像他对小狼女说的，每个我爱或者爱我的人最后都因为我死去，我眼睁睁的看着他们死去，却无能为力。\nX 战警的印象\n第一次出场在《 X 战警》中，金刚狼给我的感觉很复杂，说他很菜吧，他有利爪，又有极强的自愈能力，说他很强吧，他跟魔形女打架，却打不赢，感觉他很笨重，不灵活，跟万磁王单挑，无奈万磁王就是他的克星，一招就把他制服。\n后来几部 X 战警陆续出来，虽然他做了很多的牺牲，差点被小淘气吸光生命，忍痛送走了琴，都没有给人留下很深的印象。这个系列电影里的变种人实太多，大家都各有所长，所以他没有那么出众吧。\n金刚狼系列电影\n但自从金刚狼系列电影出来，一下子就被这个角色深深吸引，形象变得特别立体了。\n《金刚狼》第一部终于弄清楚了他的身世由来，为什么叫做金刚狼，金刚利爪是怎么来的，一一做了解答。这部电影里再也没有觉得他又菜又厉害了，后期做完手术 carry 全场，太帅了。\n《金刚狼》第二部主要发生在日本，增加了很多日本的元素：和服，武士刀，新干线。开头那幕，被原子弹的烈火包围，整个人都被灼烧殆尽，但是又很快复原，徒手从心脏里取出机械虫子，强悍的跟个怪物一样，但是他和真理子在一起，制造了很多的反差，像是美女与野兽。\n而在第三部里也表现的很反差，当金刚狼逐渐衰老，当金刚利爪无法伸出，当自愈能力越来越弱时，他也进入了每个普通人的宿命：迟暮与死亡。而根据他的基因培育出来的劳拉，也就是小狼女，正是勃勃生机，无限活力的时候。\n老头与萝莉，开着一辆快报废的车子，行使在无边无际，渺无人烟的沙漠里，还有比这更吸引人眼球的组合吗？最后他为了救下一代的变种人而选择自我牺牲，劳拉哭着喊着他 daddy 的时候，几乎要泪目，这是这个角色最高光的时候，他选择一种最伟大的解脱自己的方法。\n每个人都有英雄情节吧，有的是父亲，有的是超人，有的是孙悟空，他们拥有我们不曾拥有，也永远不会拥有的能力，他们就是这个平凡世界围墙里的一道光，带我们冲突高楼大厦的禁锢，走向幻想的无限世界。\n休杰克曼之后，再无金刚狼。\n顺便预言一下：既然马斯克这么喜欢 X ，会不会收购 X 战警呢？",

          "description": "两年前发过一个帖子  /t/834103，当时虽然说是无公网 IP 几乎抢不到上传（偶尔也有一些零零散散的上传），但是下载还是不受影响的。\n现在还是这个黑裙的配置和环境，升级到了 DSM 7.1 和 Transmission 4.0.6 ，依旧没 IPv4 的公网 IP 但有了公网 IPv6。路由器关闭了群晖所在 IP 的 DMZ （其实是分给了另一台机器，路由器是 TP-XDR5430 ，无 upnp/有 DMZ 设置，但只能为一台内网机器开启 DMZ ）\n现在出现的问题是：\nTransmission 几乎无下载速度，或者下载速度显示只有几 MB/s ，但不管下载速度多少已缓存那里几乎均无变化。然后更诡异的是，我为了测试只随便挂了一个很热的种，文件体积大概 9G 多，挂了一晚上之后进度只显示为 0.4%，但是传输信息那里居然显示已下载 116GB ！且在不断增加中，但是种子信息还是只显示已下载 43.02 MB （应该就是 9.85G x 0.4%这个结果）\n请问各位老哥是哪里的设置出了问题嘛？特意看了 PT 站的公告，不禁止 Transmission 这个客户端且是推荐 Transmission 。\n之前以为是挂载路径权限的问题，现在也开了 sc-transmission 和 Everyone 的读写权限。",

          "description": "2024 ，0805-0811\n8 月 4 日是极简时钟 iOS 上架七周年纪念日，我居然都忘了，过了两天才想起来。\n从这周开始，又进入了一个新的开发周期。\n报名 SHIP-A-TON\n周二的时候得知 RevenueCat 开展了一个名为 SHIP-A-TON 的 Hackathon ，基本的规则也很简单，就是提交一个新 App ，只要集成 RevenueCat 的 SDK 就可以。\n\n我犹豫了一天， 周二的晚上报了名。我的参赛作品就是最近在写的新 App ，然而我根本不指望这个 App 能获奖，我只想靠这次机会完成它，与其漫无节奏地开发，不如在一个目标的激励下去步步推进，毕竟 deadline 才是第一生产力。\n周三的一整天我没有动手写代码，而是在脑中计划如何写完这个 App 并顺利提交。我算了一下，从周四（ 08-08 ）开始写的话，到比赛的截止日期（ 09-18 ）是 42 天，正好是 6 个星期。于是我就在网上找了一个 Weekly Plan ，改了一下，打印出来。我把每天的工作计划都写上去，希望 6 个星期后能够写满 6 页并顺利提交 App 。四天过去了，我其实并没有严格按照 todo list 去写代码，总是脑子突然冒出一个想法，或者碰到一个优先级更高的任务，就脱轨了。\n\n除此之外，我还采用番茄钟+vlog 的方式来记录这一次的开发过程，除了每天有代码产出，还要有视频产出。我发现这两个方法同时使用的时候，比单独使用番茄钟还会令人更专注，毕竟旁边录着像，就不敢溜号去浏览跟开发无关的内容了。过去四天，每天的工作我都用剪映或者秒剪生成一个 20 秒左右的短视频作为每天的视频产出，打算每七天剪一个长一点的视频，作为开发进度的见证。\n小红书的视频没有外链，只能这么分享出来了。\n\n本周学习\n首先还是要感谢肘子哥，本周遇到了两个 SwiftData 方面的问题，在他的 Discord 里提问后很快就得到他的解答。另外他的 blog 也是值得反复学习，这周又有几个其他方面的问题，在网上搜索后答案都在他的 blog 里：\n避免 SwiftUI 视图的重复计算\nSwiftData 中的关系：变化与注意事项\nSwiftUI 4.0 的全新导航系统\n其他：\nFormatting Numbers in SwiftUI，学会了如何在 SwiftUI 的Text中对数字进行格式化\nDon't write this code! (use NSCache instead 😌)，一句话就是不要用自己写的字典当做缓存，要用专门的NSCache\n\n生活点滴\n看完了《龙之家族》第二季，三颗星\n去电影院看了《抓娃娃》，三颗星\n读完了《认知驱动》，但没有《认知觉醒》对我的启发和冲击那么大\n卖掉一个旧键盘，立刻下单了新键盘\n自学两个多月，录了上百遍，终于录成了一遍大小拉小手+風になる",

          "description": "背景\n最近一直在用 iOS 的 Safari 上网，发现一些网站密码只存在 LastPass ，但它切换设备要收费，替换它刻不容缓，虽然现在都 2024 年了。\n我的需求很简单\n抛开安全先不谈，只需要多端同步密码即可，因为有些重要的账号都是需要手机号验证。\n我目前密码需要同步的几个端：\nMac + 谷歌浏览器\nUbuntu + 谷歌浏览器\niPhone + Safari 浏览器\nWindows + 谷歌浏览器（偶尔用也要有）\n安卓 + 谷歌浏览器（基本不用也要有）\n实现过程\n上网查了资料后，Keepass 满足了我的需求，大概理解了下：\nKeepass 的所有密码是存在一个后缀为 kdbx 的数据库加密文件里。\n必须有一个正确的主密钥，才能访问和操作 kdbx 内容，主密钥可以是文本密码。\n各个端使用 Keepass 兼容的图形软件工具，它们能做到添加、编辑、在网站自动填充密码，本质上就是操作 kdbx 文件。\n思路\n所以只要在一个端设置账号密码，其他端同步过去，就能实现共用。\n也就是实现 kdbx 文件云同步事关键，文件同步我选择使用 OneDrive ，单独申请了个账号，专用存 kdbx 文件，它免费额度有 5G ，根本用不完。\n主密钥我用的是一个文本密码，记在了脑子里。\n最终的同步方案：\nPC + 谷歌浏览器用的 KeepassXC ，它提供浏览器插件，支持识别 URL 写入和填充账号密码。\nMac 和 Windows 有现成的图形化软件。\nUbuntu 我用的是命令行安装，它默认的云文件路径是在 ~/OneDrive ，需要后台运行 onedrive --synchronize 命令才能一直进行同步操作。\n手机 iOS 我使用了 KeePassium 和 Strongbox ，最终选择了 Strongbox ，原因是 Strongbox 免费版自动填充效果比较好。\n虽然 KeePassium 和 Strongbox 软件自身都集成了 OneDrive 云同步的设置，但本质上还是第三方授权拉 OneDrive 的数据。\n我试了下直接用手机装额外的 OneDrive ，直接打开 OneDrive 的文件速度会快一些，也就是说没有用 Strongbox 的云同步功能（ KeePassium 也是一样），而是像打开本地文件一样打开 OneDrive 的文件。\n结论\nOneDrive 用来同步，需要自己记一下账号密码。\n不能丢 kdbx 的主密钥，如果你存的密码很重要，建议你把它当加密钱包一样保存。\n目前我都是免费用这几个工具，KeePassium 和 Strongbox 有进阶版收费，但免费版对我来说很够用。\n安卓的我用的不多，不过我看大家推荐最多的还是 Keepass2Android ，有需要的可以试一试。\n想要实现同款方案的\n如果想尝试跟我一样的方案,可以跳到我这篇博客最后面简单看看 使用 Keepass 实现跨平台密码同步",

          "description": "怎么做的？\n思路很简单，就是把 ollama ，模型（ qwen2 ），还有前端（ChatGPT-Next-Web），想办法打包到了一起。\n都是利用的现有项目，没有任何开发的成分。\n对于全无开发经验的产品经理来说确实比较痛苦，很幸运的是跑起来了，不枉我将近两天的尝试，和 ChatGPT 的帮助。\n下载地址\n打包了 qwen2:0.5B 的演示版本，解压缩后点击运行.bat 即可，因为模型非常小，所以绝大多数 Windows 电脑都可以运行，就是比较傻。\n链接：https://cloud.189.cn/t/7fEV3qYBjuYz （访问码：wh8g ）\n为什么要做这个产品，或者有什么价值\n先吹个大一点的牛\nName Story\n这个产品的初心，是做一个属于个人，服务个人的，以安全，隐私，可靠性为目标的 AI 产品。\n我让 ChatGPT 帮我取了一系列的名字，SecureMind ，ShieldGen ，BanyanAI ，AegisAI ，PrivyBrain 等等。\n但首先是这些名字很多都被注册了；\n其次想取一个中文名的时候，很难找一个跟英文贴切又亮眼的翻译。\n后来我想到了陈奕迅的一首歌，叫《七百年后》，而这首歌的灵感来自于电影《 WALL-E 》，这也是我非常喜欢一部动画片。它们描述了在七百年后的世界，生存，家园，与爱。\n所以，我觉得 700AI 是一个好名字，蕴含了这种跨越物质与生死，无惧于时光流逝的情感与文明。（再者，700AI 这个名字也解决了我中英文的苦恼，无论在什么语言当中都很好宣传🙂）\nVision\n成为广泛，长期，跨越时代的 AI 企业。\nMission\n利用先进的技术与思维，致力于提供安全，隐私，可靠的 AI 产品与服务。力求通过 AI 的广泛应用，改善人类的生活与教育水平，提高生产效率，增强人类应对挑战的能力。\nCredo\nAI 是下一个时代的操作系统，解决生态与用户交互的问题，我们需要像思考操作系统一样来思考自己的产品。\n坚信小规模模型能力的快速提升，坚信推理成本的快速下降，基于这两点，相信本地运行的 AI 的能力会叠速发展，成为一种相当主流的服务形式。\n随着 AI 服务的愈加深入，隐私保护的问题愈加突出。\n当气候变迁，资源枯竭，能源危机，秩序崩坏，AI 高度压缩的知识与高效的信息处理，会成为文明重建的关键。\n再来点实际的\n一定要有自己的生意，哪怕再小\n来自 X 的大佬 @PengXiao 的忠告，深感认同\n这件事非常容易启动\n现成的项目很多，尽可能选 MIT license 的，大模型也都是开源的，做起来投入没有那么大。\n未来有一定的想象空间\n700AI Desktop——Studio——OS——Station （ HW ），有比较明确的演进路线。\n未来的计划\n当前有稳定工作；\n中短期内，只做离线；\n会做付费，尽早商业化，（大家也帮忙看看有没有合规风险）；\n会努力做渠道推广；\n临界点是能养活自己。\n欢迎有兴趣的伙伴加我 wx ，共同探讨：R29vZ2xlTWljcm9zb2Z0",

          "description": "大家好，我是开源图片编辑器的作者，在开发图片编辑器的过程中，因为一些功能无法扩展，出现过一次较大的重构，将整个编辑器改为了插件化的架构，经历过这次重构，规范了编辑器功能的扩展方式，解决了项目里很多重要的问题。\n如果你也在做类似的项目，或者对图片编辑器架构比较感兴趣，希望我的经验能给你一点点参考。\n大纲\n项目介绍\n为什么要做插件化\n如何实现插件化\n如何开发一个插件\n项目介绍\n项目地址： https://github.com/ikuaitu/vue-fabric-editor\n预览： https://ikuaitu.github.io/vue-fabric-editor/\n项目中文名称是快图设计，英文名称为技术栈拼接的：vue-fabric-editor ，使用 Vue3 + Fabric.js 开发的开源图片编辑器。\nFabric.js 是业界知名的 Canvas 工具库，它已经 12 岁了，在业界得到了广泛的应用和认可，可用于开发图片编辑、物联网组态、平面设计工具等场景。\n本文以介绍插件架构开发经验为主题，不对 Fabric.js 做过多介绍。\n项目特点\n插件化架构：可通过插件的形式进行扩展，定义快捷键、右键菜单、复用的 API/Event 。\n简洁易用：拖拽式设计，让普通人轻松上手操作。\n功能完善：PSD 解析、辅助线、历史记录、渐变、自定义字体、裁剪等功能，满足轻量图片编辑需求。\n\n可应用于自媒体/海报设计、平面设计、PPT 、价签设计等场景，以下为项目的实际应用截图。\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n为什么要做插件化\n项目最初使用 vue2 + Fabric.js 开发，通过使用 Vue2 的 Provide/Inject 的 API 方法，将 Fabric.js 的 canvas 对象注入到各个子组件当中。\n\n看起来好像组件各司其职，也符合满足单一职责原则，实际上隐藏着很大的问题。\n…",

          "description": "最近因为 Onedrive 快满了，所以买了腾讯云的 1T 的归档存储资源包。大部分是相机的照片和 raw 文档，所以归档存储就够，基本不会去取回。\n因为文件数量多且大，所以最近一直在上传；考虑到 Onedrive 要先下载回来再传到腾讯云上，所以用 rclone 挂载来传输；\nrclone sync --metadata --verbose --progress Onedrive:相机备份 tencentcos:fuji-1251178759/photos_bakup\n\n然后前天终于都传完了，上控制台看，感觉使用量没有显示出来有点奇怪（看下图，可以看到 3-7 日很奇怪的是 0 ），但是我觉得反正总量是小于 1T 的，就没有管它；\n\n然后今天忽然就收到邮件，说 1T 的资源包超额了；\n\n\n上去控制台看，没有呀，总量 700 多 G ，没有超过 1T 呀？\n\n于是找客服提问，\n为啥总量没超过，但是显示超额了？\n为啥这 2 天控制台显示使用量是 0 ，而且日志下载显示的使用量也是 0 ？\n\n左边是昨天下载的，3-7 日显示 0 ；右边是今天下载的日志，也是 3-7 日显示 0 ；\n\n\n这里客服发了个提前删除量的介绍，我一开始还以为是 rclone 的 sync ，每一次操作都会去刷新已上传的文件，导致已上传的文件的文件头、属性之类的变更，导致了提前删除量（汗～）\n\n但是也没有解决为啥统计量为 0 的疑问。。。\n\n\n最后这个“AbortMultipartUpload”的类型，我终于想起来了；是昨天我看到控制台的统计有点奇怪，然后有 2 个文件碎片，于是我就手贱地点了删除。。。。。。\n\n至此，终于搞懂怎么回事了：\n就是删掉的 2 个文件碎片=3.2G x 87 天（最低 90 天的归档存储）= 278.4 G\n然后它就直接全部在昨天的 1T 的资源包里进行扣除，278.4 + 745.58 刚好就是 1023.98 ，刚好超过了 1T ；\n所以各位如果想使用归档存储来备份照片的老哥们，要注意这个问题，即使有文件碎片，也要忍住，90 天后再去点“清空碎片”（无语）；如果你的碎片文件大小很大，x90 天可能费用挺高\n\n然后腾讯云的文档吧，只说到删除文件碎片会有请求费用，但是没说提前删除量的费用；我去搜索了阿里云，也是有“提前删除量”这个概念的，但是文档里也只有很少说明；\n\n最后，3-7 日显示统计量为 0 ，下载日志也是 0 ，他们只承认是展示问题，认为不涉及费用的问题。",

          "description": "中午看到一个关于 Twitter 使用的热帖，本来想下班后梳理下再回，结果回不了了于是开了个新主题。\n首先声明，这个主题是为了从信息安全的角度讨论如何保护自己和账号，为了避免吵起来最后进水深火热，请勿在此主题内讨论下面这些话题\n对绕过 GFW 这一行为的讨论\n对反诈等政策的讨论\n社会议题\n此主题也不讨论使用 Twitter 的目的，无论是涉政、涉黄、加密货币还是其他\n请将讨论控制在技术方案本身，不要发散开来。感谢各位的理解和配合\n正题：关于正常使用 Twitter 的一些想法\n不要使用和国内账号相同、相近的用户名和头像。相信都能理解。也不要用个性化的用户名，最好使用在线工具随机生成一个用户名，然后让 Twitter 自动为你附加数字生成一个不重复的用户名。\n不要和其他账号共用邮箱和手机号，建议单独新建一个 proton 的邮箱，并且使用 proton 的加号别名（类似 Gmail ）来注册。如果你之前使用的是+86 的号码或者邮箱与别的账号混用，建议注销账号重新申请。绑定手机号时也改成使用国外手机号码。\n如果你的 Twitter 注册得很早，那你可能没有绑定手机，Twitter 似乎也没有强制这一批账号再补上手机绑定。\n关于如何获得一个国外手机号码，站内和很多博客都有资料，就不在这里讨论了。\n新建 proton 邮箱是为了避免和过去你的其他账号产生关联，使用+号别名是为了尽可能避免某天你又将这个邮箱用于别的账号（当然这是不建议的），那可以祈祷脚本没有把+号别名映射到你真实邮箱地址。\n在“设置”——“隐私和安全”里关闭允许通过邮箱和手机查找你的功能\n在“设置”——“安全性和账号访问权限”里开启双重身份验证。顺便一提，v2ex 也支持此功能很久了，可以也设置一下\n同样是“设置”——“安全性和账号访问权限”里，开启密码重设保护。此设置默认关闭，这导致能够通过你的用户名获得你手机号和邮箱的首尾信息；开启此设置后，如果你需要重置密码，需要输入完整的邮箱名，所以不要忘记注册时使用的邮箱了\n如果你不希望别人知道你关注了谁，可以通过创建私密列表来实现类似关注的功能\nTwitter 大约从今年 6 月起隐藏了对推文点赞的用户列表，但指定用户的关注列表仍然是可以看到的，并且 circleboom 这样的第三方工具也能够查到关注列表。而用户创建的私密列表是不公开的。\n如果你很在意，最好的办法就是只当信息的接收者。\n如果你只是看，建议关闭私信功能，避免哪天不小心点到里面的钓鱼链接\n无论是什么平台，都不要安装客户端，完全在浏览器内使用。当然，应当使用可信任的浏览器。\n不定期修改一下你的用户名：Twitter 有内部 ID 来识别用户，但爬虫不一定拿得到\n以上这些想法是基于下面这些出发点：\n认为 Twitter 比较可信，也相应利用 Twitter 提供的安全机制保护自己的账号\n但也不完全信任 Twitter：这里不讨论 Twitter 是否有内鬼（也请各位不要扩展讨论避免吵起来）。但在内鬼之外，即使 Twitter 有各种安全机制，也难免会因为漏洞导致数据库泄露等安全问题（ 2022 年），因此最好使用单独的邮箱地址\n这些工作可能略显繁琐，每个人对信息安全也有自己的理解，很正常。觉得自作多情多此一举的朋友请单独开主题批判我，我无意争吵所以如果有类似话题我也不会回复，谢谢～\n不尽之处也欢迎各位讨论和指正。",

          "description": "其实不算是两“周年”，已经两年多了，之前一直很忙没怎么更新，但是想了想，这一篇还是要写。\n还记得当初，由于疫情一直待在家，自己觉得不如找点事做，于是就有了这个公众号，最初基本是一天一篇的，后来随着我越来越忙碌，也就是不定时更新了，但是现在仍然有一千多个支持我的朋友，在此先感谢各位。\n\n最近实在是忙碌，马上升大四了，要准备考研，要准备毕业 ...\n开端\n最初呢我只是想有一个可以分享的平台，当时觉得微信公众号是最合适的，不需要我手动做多少，注册后就可以发文，所以下定决心后立马就开干了，当时将我所知道的一些 Windows 和软件相关的东西都做了个分享，后来随着个人折腾的东西越来越多，这里发的东西也就变多了一些，粉丝也基本上一直在涨。后来，因为开做生信，所以我搭建了个人博客，博客是几经周折，最终确定下来，近一些没有什么大的改动了，使用 hugo 框架+git 版本管理+Vercel 静态部署+Cloudflare DNS 解析，域名也确定在 yuanj.top ，甚至我现在的 Gmail 也是 yuanj.top@gmail.com 。\n\n这些大家都可以参考一下之前的文章 突然发现博客已经一年多了、如何搭建一个不用服务器的，简便的博客？。\n实际上，自从有博客之后，我的重心一直在博客上，因为它很自由，一切由我说了算，还记得公众号刚开始发的一些脚本和软件的文章，老是被删，而博客就不会有这些问题，博客上呢生信和随笔偏多，而公众号里都是一些博客上我觉得不错的文章，就把它迁移过来。\n转机\n公众号的阅读量和关注量上涨最快的是 使用 Linux 三年以来的感受、把私生活放进 Telegram 里 和 抛弃 WSL2 使用 scoop 搭建开发环境，那几个月阅读量一直在几万，而这几篇文章实际上也表明了我如今“折腾主阵地”的变化，以前就是玩玩 Windows 搞搞软件，如今似乎是变“成熟”了，对以前所纠结的东西已经不那么在乎，现在更在乎的是一直精神，比如我用 Arch ，虽然桌面依旧不那么理想，但是我爱上了 KISS 原则，喜欢系统与软件包具有同等地位的包管理器，乐于探索 Linux 更深处的奥秘，这也是这篇文章的主题——公众号文章内容的变化也是我的成长之路，可以说公众号和博客见证了我一步步的成长。\n如今\n如今，我已经看淡了很多东西，比如 Windows ，需要的时候那便用就是，为什么非要纠结是不是开源、是不是 Linux ？再如 Arch 桌面，桌面有瑕疵很正常，系统和软件都会有 bug ，何必在意那么多？只要它能够带给我想要的，那便是够了。如今我也爱上了一种极简主义精神，我希望很多事可以简简单单的，在学校的桌子我会定时收拾干净，将自己经常用的东西放在手边；手机和电脑里留下那些我需要的便可，这似乎也与 Arch 的理念不谋而合，我只要我需要的。但是我也没到走火入魔的地步，因为我很清楚，有些时候是无法真正做到极简的，所以 Windows 我也照用，即使微软喜欢给用户找不痛快，那又能怎么办？因为我需要用 Endnote 和 Office ，那么 Windows 也是必须的了，这跟 KISS 原则也并不冲突。如今想想当年因为一点点小小的问题就绕很大的弯子去解决，实在是让人贻笑大方。不过我还是坚持为生活做减法，更多的关注我所在意的东西，如今我闲暇时间基本都在 TG ，订阅了几个喜欢的博客和频道，偶尔看看 V2EX 的新帖子，那便是足够了，再者就是看看 YouTube 上关注的视频博主，感觉很惬意，电子阳痿都好了很多，算是在信息爆炸时代的一种挣扎。\n之前我一直在 RSS 订阅少数派的 martix 文章，后来取消了，起初我以为他们和我一样，都是热爱一些东西，所以乐于去折腾，但最终目的还是为了干活，为了提高数字生活质量，后来发现 ... 为什么会主动去创造需求？为什么连早起都要单独一个 APP ？总感觉有种折腾到最后不知道为什么而折腾的感觉，当然，个人看法而已~\n为什么\n其实很少有人问我为什么要写那么多东西，反而是我自己喜欢问我自己，这里写的所有文章都是我自己亲自写的，没有使用任何 AI ，而我也不会去加广告什么的，因为我觉得没必要，正如前文所述，内容的变化也是我的成长之路，而内容输出则是我进步的途径，我希望能将所学分享给更多的人，让他们少走我走过的弯路，我也希望可以让更多的人看到，我始终坚持着自己的执念，并未随着时间的脚步而消散。\n我来自甘肃边陲的一个小城镇，我其实并没有很大的追求，我只想坚持我所热爱的事物，并且希望我的坚持不会随着成长而逐渐逝去。正如我爱故乡的黄昏与夕阳，并且一直爱着。\n\n\n（题外话：西北虽然经济不行，但不至于喝不起水、骑驴上学 ...）\n今后\n今后我也会继续写，坚持着内容输出，毕竟，总会帮到别人的。\n正如苏轼所说：安得广厦千万间，大庇天下寒士俱欢颜！风雨不动安如山。",

          "description": "老婆家里两个女儿，老婆是老大，下面还有个妹妹。\n小姨子本科毕业三年了，北方某省 3 线城市上班，时而有工作，月薪 4000 ，时而没工作，未婚有男朋友。\n我和老婆在北京，有房有娃，月收入 4W ，每月还贷+开销 2.5W-3w 。\n生活水平说得过去，压力也挺大。\n丈母娘在北京帮我们带娃，每个月给 5k 带娃费。\n小姨子几个事迹：\n1.经常来北京玩，一年来几次，来这白吃白喝白住不干家务，每次空手来，走的时候从我们家背一包东西走（主要是一些吃的喝的用的，倒也不值钱）。。。\n2.往返北京的高铁票总想让她姐给她买，通过各种拐弯抹角的方式暗示她姐帮她买票。\n3.总想着让我们在她妈身上花钱，比如她篡夺她妈和她一起去外地旅游，然后把她和她妈的机票截图发个她姐（明示让她姐给她俩买票，因为丈母娘的票我老婆肯定要买的，毕竟在这带孩子，从这里出发的，她这样就把她的票也带上了让她姐一起买）。\n4.其实丈母娘也一样，总想着我们多给她这个小女儿花钱，比如通过各种方式让我们给她买东西，她每次走的时候，丈母娘也尽量把我们的好东西（她认为的好东西）塞她包里带走。。。\n我是独生子，有点理解不了，她姐已经结婚了，严格来说，她姐的钱也是我的钱，我怎么觉得一个已经工作这么久的人，不应该这样总想着占姐姐的便宜？是我太小气了吗？",

          "description": "沉沉的睡了一觉，突然醒来了。女朋友躺在我的手臂上，躺太久，手臂被她压的有些麻了。我轻轻的把手臂从她的脖子下抽离开。想起来两个人刚刚战斗完，疲惫的睡了好久了。看着她熟睡中的可爱模样，忍不住在她的额头上的亲了一口，发现她的皮肤有点 Q 弹且温热。\n跟女朋友已经认识两年，发现我们有很多的地方都很相似，彼此变得越来越熟悉，我一个眼神，她一个动作，我们就能明白彼此在想什么。上个月刚在广场上求婚成功，她激动的哭了，我也激动的哭了，两年的爱情长跑总算是有了一个结果，下一步就是商量在哪领证，办婚礼，好在两个人达成了共识：不用太铺张，就两家人简简单单的吃个饭就行。\n我稍微从床上坐起来了，靠在枕头上，打开手机，奇怪，今天是周末，怎么企业微信多了这么多条信息，本来周末坚决不工作的原则，我点了手机上的叉号，那些消息被一键清除了。又有些后悔，从 app 里点开了，原来是 CTO 和同事们发来了一大段小作文。\n上周五经过昏天黑地的加班，终于把省外的一个大项目上线了，这时候公司的几百万钱款终于能到账。这次的项目工期紧张，又是完全没有开发过的领域，基本上每天工作都在十几个小时以上，每天下班公司都没人了，空荡荡的大厅，我把所有的灯一片一片的熄灭，最后锁上大门才放心离开。\n经过这次的项目上线，虽然拿不到很高额的奖金，但这次成功上线，这个部门主管位置基本上稳了。来这个公司好几年了，公司的氛围很好，和老员工们早已经打成一片，晚上一起吃加班餐，周末有时候也会聚聚。但是却一直做的是边边角角的工作，始终没有掌握公司的核心业务，我知道，在这个部门里，只有我一个人是新人，只有我资历最浅，领导始终有些不信任我吧。这次的项目上线，我终于能挤进来他们这个圈子里。\n很客气的跟领导回了一句：这都是领导指挥的好，我才能在你的英明部署下顺利上线呀，随即就把企微给关了。\n打开微信，发现妈妈给我发了好多的照片，他们已经开车到泉州了，上个月我买了一辆车子，本来想着平时代步用的，没想到爸爸却很喜欢我的 SUV,明着说帮我给车子热热身，实际上就是看上我的车了呗。\n本来他们已经买好了火车票，要去南方玩一下，爸爸说既然儿子有新车了，那么就跟妈妈一起开车过去吧。我们忙了一辈子了，基本上都在打工，现在该是去体验一下世界，勇闯生活了。\n妈妈给我发了好多在平潭拍的照片，看见大海，她就兴奋的不行了，像个小孩子一样：这里的大海怎么这么宽啊，比老家的湖宽了好多，这里的大海怎么这么蓝啊，真好看，就是海鲜吃不惯，没有老家的腊肉好吃。。。\n。。。\n嘟嘟嘟，嘟嘟嘟，嘟嘟嘟。\n沉沉的睡了一觉，突然醒来了。脑袋稍微有些疼，领导打电话来了：你们上周上的什么东西，赶紧给我解决掉！我仔细一想：原来周五的上线出了好多 bug 。\n艰难的起床，脚不小心碰到了地上的酒瓶，在地上翻滚，旋转，传递给下一个酒瓶，一个接一个，发出哐哐哐的声音。这一周的工作压力特别大，每天都靠着酒精才能勉强睡几个小时。\n把桌子上点的外卖盒子都推到一边，键盘于是从垃圾堆里冒出头了，打开电脑，微信弹出来好多爸妈的消息：我们天天厂里上班这么累，你到底什么时候才能找一个女朋友，结婚生子。这么大人了，还让我们操心?\n哒哒哒哒哒，我开始工作了。。。\n灵感来自于自穆赫兰道，\n写在三十岁生日来临之际。",

          "description": "略微 emo\n周末躺了两天，打算晚上远程处理一下工作的事情的，没想到办公室的电脑断网了，没连上没办法处理了。\n再者，上周五组内一个老哥被打了 c 绩效，大概原因就是他的站队问题，领导觉得他不够听话之类的。找了个理由让他背了 c 绩效，c 绩效只能拿到绩效工资的 80%。。\n\n裸辞重新出发\n\n0401 哥们从国企裸辞了，一个半月的时间内面了 6 家。过了 2 家。一家拒了，一家就是现在这家。当时来这的原因: 传统制造业行业。上班时间差不多。一样的早 8 晚 5 双休。工资比国企多个 1/4 。入职了 3 个月，加班时长 6 个小时，这点确实还行。\n\n出发后发现没那么稳定\n\n从国企出来，也跟组内人出来聊过。大多数企业其实都是成本+是否听话问题。你做了领导狗腿子，你就会比其他人更容易脱颖而出。成本自然而然的就是想办法换掉高薪资的。小规模企业动作更快。稍微有点规模的企业倒还好。时间线可以拉长一点。入职接近 3 个人。部门招了 6 个新人。其中 4 个 30 以上，作为一个 it 部门，对 30+的人员开绿灯。这点确实良心。。。这里开始怀疑了。。。是真的开绿灯，还是想换掉那一批旧人呢？但是如果从成本来说，招刚毕业的，1-3 年内的岂不是更加省。为什么会找 4 个 30+的。。。新入职的公司是私企。虽然有了 39 年的历史。还是相对互联网稳定的传统制造业。。。但确实没有上家国企那么稳定，上家就算裁员，部门缩编，但也会给你一个内部转岗的机会。。。\n\n计较太多反而迷失了自己\n\n18 年上大学，选了计算机专业。21 年深圳科技园实习。确实感觉到了竞争与压力。\n22 年毕业进了国企。而且在一个三四线城市。确实感受到了慢节奏。对比一些在广深的同学，其他也没有比他们差多少。\n24 年。行情不好。广深卷性价比也不高。去了佛山。\n好像我人生每一步，都在讲究性价比。去看这件事情有没有未来，有没有出路，做了这事划算不。。。经常去看一些论坛，确实也看了不少人生百态。。。也深知。。。钱是唯一的解法。。。其实我不羡慕那些在广深那些 10 几 k 的同学，（不过这行情。其实我们班上没几个）。 想到加班。想到大小周。想到广深的生存成本。再者能力有限。。。我现在每天 5 点下班，超市买点菜自己煮。在他们眼里，我仿佛又是那个被羡慕的人。。\n世界参差不齐。冲浪太多，容易迷失自己的定位，还会因为得不到的东西而内耗自己。\n\n写到最后\n\n任何选择客观来说有好有坏，其实也没有多后悔过，因为站在当时的视角看，我都遵从我内心做出了选择，后续发生的一切都只是命运附加的安排而已。。。是的，这是在论坛里的一个帖子。告诉我。做了选择就不要后悔，缅怀了。\n现在的任何一点提升。都是对抗风险的底气。\n未来不定。祝好！",

          "description": "很多人应该都像我一样, 在淘宝同质化严重且价格差不多的东西里, 会选择有运费险的商品, 即使你不一定会退.\n但今天的经历让我长见识了, 在经济不好的大环境下, 坏人可不只是底层小商家, 平台也会跟你刷伎俩.\n首先你挑选了一个有运费险标志的商品, 下单付款后订单里也显示 退货包运费保障中.\n但其实, 这时候你的运费险暂时还没有生效. 而是在卖家实际发货了, 所谓的系统才会真的放行这个保险订单, 不放行之前这个保险订单是否生效, 你作为消费者是无从判断的.\n然而, 问题来了, 真的等到卖家发货了, 你就不能在发货前取消订单了, 而只能在收货后退货. 如果保险订单没有被系统放行, 那么你这个商品实际就享受不了退货险了.\n也就是说套路是这样的:\n首先给你虚假宣传: 来吧亲, 买我们这个东西可以包运费退货哦.\n然后在无退货发生时: 仍然假装在 APP 里显示 退货包运费保障中, 给消费者一种良好的幻觉\n最后在有退货发生时, 才撕破脸: 什么? 你付款付好了? 哦哦, 不好意思亲, 这一单我们没有给你运费保险哦, 你还是要付运费退货的哦\n我对广告法了解不多, 但是仅从讲道理的角度来说, 你既然运费险不是一定送, 你就应该在所谓的 运费险标志 旁边写清楚, 这运费险不是 100%有. 否则就相当于,买了一张飞机票, 结果登机时告诉你,座位不一定有,要实际起飞了才能告诉你是不是有,没有座位你就坐厕所里去吧.更不能在商品订单产生后, 仍然假惺惺写一个 '退货免运费保障中' 继续骗人.\n而且, 你既然保险不给, 为什么不在订单寄出后, 通过 APP 内或者短信的方式告知消费者? 简简单单一个通知都做不到? 平时发广告发得那么起劲呢?\n这个锅, 是产品经理背? 还是程序员背? 如果是而已欺诈, 那就是产品经理背. 如果是程序员没把保险状态合理及时地推送给消费者, 那就是程序员背. 但说到底, 都是淘宝背. 虽然运费钱不多, 但是为了淘宝的锅而付钱, 非常来气, 特别是在对方有 故意的可能倾向 时",

Details...\n点击 Details...，提示：\nCannot Get Mail\nThe connection to the server failed\n然而邮箱应用里的另一个基本不使用的多年前注册的账号没问题。\n立即查看 iCloud Status ，全绿。\n使用网页版 iCloud 查看，登陆后，所有功能正常，除了邮件。点击邮件图标，提示:\nUnable to Open iCloud Mail\niCloud Mail cannot be loaded at this time.\n登录 AppleID 网页后，账号一切正常，查看邮件地址，A@xxx.com 和 B@icloud.com 都赫然在列。\n无奈联系苹果客服，首先通过 iMessage 联系，来的是个心不在焉的客服（英语），举几个例子：\n我提供了 iPhone 上的截图，对方问我 Mac 的问题\n我说了尝试了网页登录，且登录正常，还提供了截图，对方问，你尝试网页办 iCloud 了么\n要求转交给 senior 级别人员，并提供了电话。不知道此人怎么记录的电话，收到了邮件（ A@xxx.com 收到的），提示工作人员尝试联系我，然而手机完全没动静。\n换了电话之后，终于在次日接到了电话，然而电话里的工作人员只是进行了常规排查，比如重新登录什么的。最后补充了一张截图（初次我提交了多张截图都用上了），复现了问题，提交了 log ，同时工作人员记录了时间方便相关同事定位，说是会转给工程师。\n现在两天过去了，邮箱依然用不了……\n搜了一圈，也没查到谁有类似的问题……",

          "description": "之前的一些讨论\nWindows11 远程桌面的这个用户名和密码到底是什么\nWindows10 更改 Microsoft 账户密码后远程桌面密码不变\n目的\n起因是当我改了一次微软账号的密码后，发现 rdp 还是能用之前的账号密码登录，反而用新的密码无法登录。\n于是就开始搜集资料并进行本地验证。\n一番验证后，了解了微软账号(Microsoft Account)和本地帐号(Local Account)的区别。做一些整理后发出来让大家以后遇到类似情况时有个参考。\n欢迎大家讨论纠错。\n账号\n当首次登录 windows 时，系统会让你登录微软账号，也就是经典的这个页面。\n\n此时当成功登录微软账号后，系统会为这个微软账号创建一个本地账号，通常账号名是邮箱前缀。\n但如果 windows 上已有一个相同前缀的本地账号，比如先使用\"abc@outlook.com\"登录，生成了本地账号\"abc\"，又使用\"abc@icloud.com\"登录，那么系统则会为创建的本地账号名添加随机后缀。例如第二个本地账号为\"abc_2qoabc\"。\n使用 win + r 运行 netplwiz 会进入\"用户账户\"页面，双击用户名，即可看到本机用户的用户名和全名。\n\n密码\n需要知道的是，与 windows 有关的密码有三种。\n微软账号(Microsoft Account)的密码\n本地账号(Local Account)的密码\nPIN\nPIN 是否能算密码还有待商榷。至少应该不会有人用 PIN 去尝试登录远程桌面。PIN 只存在 windows 本地，用于本机登录使用，不会与任何服务器发生交流。\n当我们初次使用微软账号登录 windows 时，本地帐号(Local Account)的密码会同步成微软账号(Microsoft Account)的密码。\n但是当我们使用网页修改微软账号(Microsoft Account)的密码后，新的密码并不会同步到本地账号上(Local Account)。而使用 rdp 服务不需要与微软服务器进行对话, 只需要客户端与目的计算机对话, 所以仍能使用旧密码登录远程桌面。要想改变登录远程桌面的密码，就只能手动触发同步密码的流程。\n目前我找到的是在锁屏界面点击\"忘掉了 pin\"，重新登陆下微软账号即可，并不需要重设 PIN 。只需要登录账号，然后取消操作就行。\n我看到网上说\"将微软账号转成本地账号\"或是\"退出微软账号\"，之后重新登录微软账号也可以触发同步流程。但是在 windows 11 上我没有找到这些操作的按钮，也比较担心这些操作可能带来的副作用，就没有尝试了。\n应用登录\n登录这一流程分应用，这里用的是两个常用的应用，一个是 windows 上的\"远程桌面\"，另一个是 ios 上的\"RD Client\"。\n以微软账号为abc@outlook.com，密码是password来举例。\n远程桌面\n\n在\"远程桌面\"中，可以使用的用户名是：\nabc@outlook.com\noutlook.com\\abc\nabc\nMicrosoftAccount\\abc\nMicrosoftAccount\\abc@outlook.com\n并且这 5 种方式在被其他客户端挤掉线后都会以 5. MicrosoftAccount\\abc@outlook.com 的方式呈现用户名。\n这些账号中前两种符合微软 RDP 的用户名要求用户 @域或域\\用户。第三种或许是因为他是本地用户？第 4 、5 种是\"远程桌面\"自动帮忙解析了MicrosoftAccount？\nRD Client\n\n在 RD Client 中，能用的用户名有图片中这三种，也就是前一小节中第 1 到 3 种用户名格式。\n权限\n\n使用 win+r 运行 gpedit.msc, 即可打开\"本地组策略编辑器\", 在\"计算机配置\"->\"Windows 设置\"->\"安全设置\"->\"本地策略\"->\"用户权限分配\"->\"允许通过远程桌面服务登录\"中可以看到被允许远程登录计算机的组(group).\n\n使用 win+x 点击\"计算机管理\"->\"系统工具\"->\"本地用户和组\"->\"组\", 双击组即可看到这个组里有哪些用户了.",

          "description": "某省某厅新设立了一个金融国企，该国企新设立一个了 100%控股的数字金融信息公司招聘一个系统开发岗(文末有 jd)，官网发布公告到停止报名只有一周时间，由猎聘做的资格筛查和笔试，笔试通过后转由该国企自行进行初面和二面。\n周五下午通过短信和邮件由猎聘通知笔试(没有电话通知)，要求周日下午进行在线笔试，需要做如下准备：\n- 必须使用带内置麦克风和摄像头的笔记本电脑进行笔试\n- 使用手机对准背部实时摄像，手机需要拍摄到考生的背面和桌面。关键点，手机如何保持和人坐姿一样高？\n仅一天多的时间准备调试好上面的环境。幸运的是我刚好有满足条件的笔记本和可以把手机夹住的图书阅读架。笔试内容为某省金融政策、区块链、行测、简单的计算机后端相关知识。注意这里，计算机相关知识分毫不考 java ，jd 也不强调必须会 java ，但是后续面试一直强调你会 java 吗。我本人不是 java 技术栈。\n笔试之后的第二周工作日，没有任何电话通知的情况下，突然由该国企的邮箱于 11:35 发出面试邀约，要求 15:00 之前回复是否参加周六日的初试和复试，且填写招聘报名表和提供学历学位证书图片。幸运的是，我刚好在刷邮件且有保存学历学位证书图片，否则就会错过。\n今天周六去参加了线下一面，hr 上来就给了一道题，要求十分钟做完。题目大致是：由于某省每年都有 30 万人参与各种资格证考试，数据量很大，查询成绩时会导致数据库崩溃，要求进行考试分数查询系统数据库表结构设计。由于正面空间较少，正面仅写了 3NF 和反范式等方法论的文字，再补上了\"详见背面\"的文字。背面写了详细的 DB schema ，和 ER 图。\n题目做完后，hr 带我进入面试会场，7~8 个人，大概 4 个面试官，其余人是陪同。我将答题纸正面朝上递给第一个面试官，第一个面试官看了一眼，递给第二个面试官，第二个面试官也看了一眼，继续递给第三个面试官。第三个面试官终于看到\"详见背面\"字眼，将答题纸举高高，戳着背面，问我是在背面作答了吗？继续传递给第四个面试官。\n自我介绍后，第三个面试官发言，你在 X 公司(BAT 之一)是外包吗？你会 java 吗，我们这里用的 java ？你之前是怎么做到没有写过 java 的情况下，使用 java 一周内写完一个系统的？\n大家还有什么问题吗？ X 老师(这里指第一个面试官，4~50 岁的年纪)，X 老师！ X 老师，你有什么问题吗？喂 X 老师！拍了拍坐在旁边的第二个面试官：喊下 X 老师。\nX 老师此时正在很入定的假装看着我的各种材料，终于听到有人喊他，抬了抬头，摆摆手说，没有问题。\n第三个面试官突然望上向墙上，wang 老师，你有什么问题吗？(我才知道还有人通过远程会议接入)\nwang 老师：你简历有段经历是什么公司？\n我：!#!$@#%@#!@  (这里是政府涉密的经历)\n第三个面试官：是外包吗？你为什么离职？\n我：(各种解释)\n面试持续了 5 分钟，hr 送我进入电梯，当天收到拒信。\n个人情况：\n211 ，bat ，非 java 后端，工作十几年。\n\n附上 jd：\n1.计算机、数学、统计等相关专业，国内高等院校本科及以上学历、学位，或具有教育部认可的境外高等院校本科及以上学历、学位。2.具有 2 年以上 IT 相关工作经验，具有 1 年及以上系统开发经验，具有金融行业 IT 经验者优先。3.熟悉 java 或其他主流语言的一种或多种（前后端不限），具有丰富的代码调试经验，熟悉常用开源框架，熟悉常规 web 服务器、分布式架构、缓存、消息队列等开源中间件并能合理运用。4.熟悉常见组件，熟悉 Mysql 、Oracle 数据库，TG 数据库至少熟练操作一种。5.年龄原则上不超过 40 岁。",

          "description": "我有一台固定在云台上的相机，我想要知道这个相机相对安装平台的旋转和平移量。其中云台是固定不动的，只有 pitch 、yaw 、和 roll 轴的运动。查了一下应该是用这个函数：\nvoid calibrateHandEye(\n    InputArrayOfArrays R_gripper2base,  // 云台 p y r 角度转换出来的旋转矩阵\n    InputArrayOfArrays t_gripper2base,  // 输入的是 0 ，因为没有任何移动（并且想用云台平台当世界坐标中心点）\n    InputArrayOfArrays R_target2cam,    // calibrateCamera 输出的 rvec\n    InputArrayOfArrays t_target2cam,    // calibrateCamera 输出的 tvec\n    OutputArray R_cam2gripper, \n    OutputArray t_cam2gripper, \n    HandEyeCalibrationMethod method = CALIB_HAND_EYE_TSAI)\n\n我现在是这样做的：\n将云台的 p y r 旋转到不同角度，拍摄棋盘格的照片，同时记录该时刻的 p y r 角旋转角度；\n使用 calibrateCamera 得到每一张图片里棋盘格的 tvec 和 rvec ；\n将记录的云台 p y r 角度转换为旋转矩阵；\n调用 calibrateHandEye 。\n但是结果和实际相差巨大。因此想来 V 站看看有没有人有过这方面经验，能看出我的步骤里可能有什么问题……先在这里谢过各位了！\n我个人感觉比较容易出问题的地方是第三步的转换，我是这样写的：\n    Eigen::Quaternionf euler2quaternionf(const float z, const float y, const float x)\n    {\n        const float cos_z = cos(z * 0.5f), sin_z = sin(z * 0.5f),\n                    cos_y = cos(y * 0.5f), sin_y = sin(y * 0.5f),\n                    cos_x = cos(x * 0.5f), sin_x = sin(x * 0.5f);\n\n        Eigen::Quaternionf quaternion(\n            cos_z * cos_y * cos_x + sin_z * sin_y * sin_x,\n            cos_z * cos_y * sin_x - sin_z * sin_y * cos_x,\n            sin_z * cos_y * sin_x + cos_z * sin_y * cos_x,\n            sin_z * cos_y * cos_x - cos_z * sin_y * sin_x\n        );\n\n        return quaternion;\n    }\n\n\n先转换为四元数，再求旋转矩阵（用 Eigen 自带的方法）。",

          "description": "家里 4 口人，父母我弟。父母过半百了，都是低学历，弟弟小学，我刚本科毕业。\n缘由\n我爸前几年在农村（偏僻，老人巨多，人口密度小，小学一个班才十几个人，设施约等于无，仅有的几家小卖部和卫生所）自建房，别墅，不知道出于什么原因，搞的很豪华（前前后后花了 160w 有了。三层楼，一半都住不满，才 4 个人），又借了 20w 才建成。后面疫情，没生意，生活费又借了 15w 。\n经济负担\n35w 的债务每个月需要 2100 利息。母亲每天电车帮人送东西赚个饭钱。父亲生意惨淡，家庭基本开销（不算我）保持都勉强。如果我平均每个月花 4000 给家里还债，至少 10 年才还得完。弟弟还有 10 多年读书也要钱，一起算 20w ，父母没有社保，老了怎么办？生活费还要，继续给 20 年每月 1000 （以当前购买力看待，1000 是因为弟弟长大后可以分担一些），算下来一共需要 92w （以当前购买力判断）。\n无力感\n每一代应该都更进一步。ok\n从无情的金钱比较上来说，按平价购买力，我从小到大也不会花到 50w ，现在要我返回去近 100w ？\n我 20 到 30 多岁，高压还债，我不要家庭的？我不想幸福的？还是继续和上一代一样，累着吧？\n父亲还 tmd 老灌输生孩子的思想，wqtmd ，再这么搞下去，回农民得了。\n其次那套别墅我也不住，我未来是不可能回那么偏僻的农村里住的。所以我继承了什么？\n父辈的努力和债务，最后就剩下一个无人住的房子。。。\n我自己能想到的方案\n1.卖了\n想个办法，把自建别墅（唯一一个房子）卖了，把债务还了，去城市里买个 60-80w 的。我弟的教育资源（家里农村这边的学习环境真不行）更好了。父母现在就可以半退休，做点轻松的活，我每月给 2000 基础生活费，平时没事去逛逛公园，商场也好。房子可以继承，也更好买卖，下一代至少可以获得更好的教育资源。\n阻碍也很明显，父母可能因为生活习惯和念旧情结，以及陌生的环境，大概率很难适应。\n2. 不还了\n还个 jb ，反正借贷人不是我。老赖就老赖。真还不上，房子是唯一住房，不会拍卖但是可能会查封，一般不会拿走拍卖。爱住哪住哪，操蛋的。\n我要着手我自己的家庭和下一代。\n3. 还利息\n继续坚持还利息，保持房子还能住。还到父母去世，可能要继续还 30-50 年。要的钱更多，更不划算。\n4. 还完\n努力还完，父母去世后，想尽办法把房子卖了，回波血。\n后记\n花超出能力范围的钱，为了不实用的东西，是重大的决策失误。\n拖垮下一代。还 tmd 大男子主义，呵呵。",

          "description": "2024 年的巴黎奥运会各项比赛正在如火如荼进行，但是在个人感官上，这一届的奥运会热度好像有点低。\n对于开幕式，有两点切身的感受比较深刻。一个是时间定于 7 月 27 日（星期六）凌晨，第二个是可以在电影院观看 2024 年巴黎奥运会开幕式直播。这些信息基于都是来源于自己在上班路上的听广播习惯，广州可进行奥运会开幕式观影预约的影院仅有 4 家，但需要达到最低拼场人数才可 \"开团\"！\n作为史上第一次把开幕式放在室外搞，也是首次摈弃以往步行进入体育场的传统，让运动员乘船沿着巴黎的\"主干道\" ——塞纳河前进。这届奥运会的确有点别出心裁。个人对于开幕式并没有什么特别值得期待的，也就事后通过各种短视频看了一下中国代表团出场、点燃圣火，以及其他零零散散的一些画面，感觉相比上一届的日本奥运会，巴黎奥运会给人印象更加深刻，文化底蕴、开放性、包容性都很不错，但也不可否认开幕式过后的各种两极分化评论，这的确也是争议性相当大的异常奥运会。\n奥运会最大的看点还是比赛。作为四年难得一遇的体育盛宴，各项赛程都很吸引人。\n个人最大的期待，还是在于羽毛球，小组赛的赛程也追了很多场，接下来依旧值得期待。跳水、游泳、排球、篮球，时间允许下肯定也是不能错过的。",
