          "description": "Hey folks,\nAbout a year ago my wife and I, both closing in on 40, quit our jobs at Red Hat to start a games company and learn game development. Many things happened along the road, and about a week ago we released our first (small) game on Steam.\nhttps://store.steampowered.com/app/2816120/Mazelit/\nThe demo is free to play up to level 8 (the final game plays up to level 80) and we'd appreciate any feedback you have, whether it's for the store page or the game itself.\nWe made the game in Godot 4.2 in roughly 3 months and I was working full time next to it. Since we ran into a bunch of roadblocks, we decided to also offer the entire source code up as a DLC in case someone wants to go look how we implemented the game, mod the game, or compile it for a different platform. The only thing we can't redistribute with the game code is the Steamworks SDK, which is available for download from Steam. (The game minus integration is fully runnable without the SDK, though.)\nCheers and happy weekend!\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40017180\nPoints: 19\n# Comments: 1",

          "description": "Hello everyone!\nAt a company I worked for, we needed to develop an MVP (basically a web page) and apply certain business logic to a Google Drive spreadsheet that was frequently updated by the Sales team.\nIn this case, we had two options:\nDevelop a backend to replace the current spreadsheet and have the sales team use it as a new \"backoffice\" - This would take a very long time, and if the hypothesis we were testing was wrong, it would be time wasted.\nCreate the web page and use Google's SDK to extract data from the spreadsheet.\nWe chose to go with the second option because it was quicker. Indeed, it was much faster than creating a new backoffice. But not as quick as we imagined. Integrating with Google's SDK requires some effort, especially to handle the OAuth logic, configure it in the console, and understand the documentation (which is quite shallow, by the way).\nAnyway! We did the project and I realized that maybe other devs might have encountered similar issues. Therefore, I developed a tool that transforms Google spreadsheets into \"realtime APIs\" with PATCH, GET, POST, and DELETE methods.\nSince it's a product for devs, I think it would be cool to hear your opinions. It's still quite primitive, but the basic features already work.\nhttps://zerosheets.com\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40014730\nPoints: 96\n# Comments: 53",

          "description": "Hi HN,\nmoved by curiosity about how to build an autonomous agent, and to explore the boundaries of machine creativity, I built a fictional entity (dubbed Livia) powered by LLMs, Multimodal models and text-to-image models to find some answers.\nWhat happened instead is that more questions have cropped up. An important hypothesis of this project is that, by observing the train of thought and witnessing the simulated state of mind and emotional emulation surrounding it, humans could empathize with a machine. What happens when that's the case? Would people enjoy companionship from a synthetic person? Would the Art establishment ever consider a non-human author (capable of making art and interacting with other humans) an Artist?\nWhatever the answers, I can't shake away the feeling that human uniqueness is being eroded and that we risk facing a crisis of meaning. Perhaps projects such as this help us demonize those fears, similarly to how sci-fi does, even though the boundary between fiction and reality is blurring.\nThis was a collaboration with Tibor (hn user: https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=tiborsaas). Read our release posts on:\nhttps://jamez.it/blog/b/14f\nand\nhttps://tibor.szasz.hu/post/stream-of-consciousness\nHope you enjoy it as much as we had fun building it.\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40011937\nPoints: 44\n# Comments: 13",

          "description": "Here's a \"behind-the-scenes\" look at my development of a cool sensor during my PhD (electrical engineering). This sensor is only about 1/3 of my total research for my degree and took about a year.\nI've been on HN for a while now and I've seen my fair share of posts about the woes of pursuing a PhD. Now that I'm done with mine I wanna share some anecdotal evidence that doing a PhD can actually be enjoyable (not necessarily easy) and also be doable in 3 years.\nWhen I started I knew I didn't want to work on something that would never leave the lab or languish in a dissertation PDF no one will ever read. Thanks to an awesome advisor I think I managed to thread the needle between simplicity and functionality.\nLooking back, the ideas and methods behind it are pretty straightforward, but getting there took some doing. It’s funny how things seem obvious once you've figured them out!\nOh, I love creating GUIs for sensor data and visualizations as you'll see -- it's such a game changer! pyqtgraph is my go-to at the moment - such a great library.\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40003710\nPoints: 441\n# Comments: 90",

Ours is interesting because it's a latent diffusion model instead of a language model, which makes it more controllable: https://sonauto.ai/\nOthers do music generation by training a Vector Quantized Variational Autoencoder like Descript Audio Codec (https://github.com/descriptinc/descript-audio-codec) to turn music into tokens, then training an LLM on those tokens. Instead, we ripped the tokenization part off and replaced it with a normal variational autoencoder bottleneck (along with some other important changes to enable insane compression ratios). This gave us a nice, normally distributed latent space on which to train a diffusion transformer (like Sora). Our diffusion…",

          "description": "If you're feeling useless, remember that I exist.\nLet me give you some context. I work in the pipeline automation department of a company. Last month, our team decided to deprecate an internal tool due to several maintenance issues. So we created a pipeline that automates the implementation of this legacy tool, in case other teams needed to use it. (WHAT???)\nThis month, a guy in my team found some improvement scenarios in the automation. So I was chosen to implement this changes in this legacy internal tool.\nThe thing is, after I finished the adjustments, my pull requests are not getting approved due to adjustments meticulously requested by this guy in my team. Adjustments to make the pipeline automation even more resilient in complete unlikely scenarios.\nBut this same week, my TL sent notices to all the other teams informing them that this internal tool has been deprecated and they should no longer use it. So what sense does it make to have a pipeline automation that implements the use of the deprecated tool? And if it has been deprecated, why would I need to make an adjustment for the automation to be even resilient if no one should be able to use it anymore? So why am I being allocated to work on in such waste of time like it? (WTF???)\nThis makes me wonder, how many people have to work on something that they see no sense in doing at all.\nSo once again, if you're feeling useless, remember that I exist.\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39942397\nPoints: 184\n# Comments: 246",

One of our worst headaches was making these really powerful codebases work on desktop, web, mobile, and the cloud without having to completely rewrite them.  For example, to get Lightroom and Photoshop working on the web we took a winding path through JavaScript, Google’s PNaCl, asm.js, and finally WebAssembly, all while having to rethink our GPU architecture around these devices. We even had to get single-threaded builds working and rebuild the UI around Web Components. Today the web builds work great, but it was a decade-long journey to get there!\nThe graphics stack continues to be one of the biggest bottlenecks in portability.

In puzzle mode, you beat back your NPC opponent's words and take over their territory.\nTruncate started as a pen and paper game between a friend and I, evolved into a handmade board game, and finally arrived at an online puzzle game. Like any good word game, there is of course a daily mode, shareable with the tried and true grid of emojis\nWe've been playtesting it with friends and family for a few months, which has helped iron out the tutorials and gameplay, and we're finally happy with an MVP worth sharing!\nTechnical deets: The client and server are written in Rust, with the visuals built using egui (as an experiment in Rust's GUI ecosystem).\nWe'd love any feedback!\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39882873\nPoints: 126\n# Comments: 82",

Since then, we’ve been schooled and humbled in every way building 100TB+ data and ML systems for the https://spice.ai cloud platform. Along with our customers, we struggled with getting fast, low-latency, high-concurrency SQL query within a budget, accessing and combining data from many sources, trade-offs between OLTP/OLAP compute engines, and managing datasets as code.\nToday, we’re re-launching Spice, completely rebuilt from the ground up, to directly solve several of the problems we had in accessing data quickly and cost-effectively  providing it to applications, dashboards, and machine learning. Spice provides federated SQL query across databases (MySQL, PostgreSQL, etc.), data warehouses (Snowflake, BigQuery, etc.) and data lakes (S3, MinIO, Databricks, etc.) with the ability to materialize remote datasets locally using in-memory Arrow, DuckDB, SQLite, or PostgreSQL. Accelerated engines run in your infrastructure giving you flexibility and control over price and performance.\nYou can read the full announcement blog post at https://blog.spiceai.org/posts/2024/03/28/adding-spice-the-n....\nWe’d appreciate it if you check Spice out, give us feedback, and if you'd like to contribute, we'd love to build with you.\nThanks!\nGitHub: https://github.com/spiceai/spiceai\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39854584\nPoints: 84\n# Comments: 20",

Tracecat automates the tasks a security analyst has to do when responding to a security alert: e.g. contact victims, investigate security logs, report vulnerability.\nThe average security analyst deals with 100 alerts per day. As soon as an alert comes in, you have to investigate and respond. An average alert takes ~30 minutes to analyze (and 100 x 30 min = 50 hours > one whole day) Lots of things get dropped, and this creates vulnerabilities. Many breaches can be traced back to week old alerts that didn’t get properly investigated.\nSince the risks and costs are so high, top security teams currently pay Splunk SOAR $100,000/year to help automate alert processing.

It’s designed to simplify the creation of API documentation by just using your website or service, especially useful when you're pressed for time.\nDocumenting endpoints one by one sucks. This project originated from us needing it at our past jobs when building 3rd-party integrations.\nIt acts as a local server proxy that listens to your application’s HTTP traffic and automatically translates this into OpenAPI 3.0 specs, documenting endpoints, requests, and responses without much effort.\nInstallation is straightforward with NPM, and starting the server only requires a few command-line arguments to specify how and where you want your documentation generated ex. npx autospec --portTo PORT --portFrom PORT --filePath openapi.json\nIt's designed to work with any local website or application setup without extensive setup or interference with your existing code, making it flexible for different frameworks. We tried capturing network traffic on Chrome extension and it didn't help us catch the full picture of backend and frontend interactions.\nWe aim in future updates to introduce features like HTTPS and OpenAPI 3.1 specification support.\nFor more details and to get started, visit our GitHub page (https://github.com/Adawg4/openapi-autospec). We also have a Discord community (https://discord.com/invite/CRnxg7uduH) for support and discussions around using OpenAPI AutoSpec effectively.\nWe're excited to hear what you all think!\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39817850\nPoints: 86\n# Comments: 25",

It allows you to search for a key and get the value and the line number where it is located.\nI created this tool because I sometimes struggle to find specific keys in typical i18n rails yamls. In the views, you don't always have the whole key, but it is extrapolated from the context.

For example, a user can say \"When I get an email from a potential customer, add their details to a google sheet and send me a text\", and DryMerge sets that up end-to-end in seconds. Other examples might be “When I finish a Google Meet with a customer, record any issues reported in Linear”, or “Every morning at 9 am, text me a summary of my calendar events for the day”.\nHere’s a video walkthrough: https://youtu.be/S4L3B21vXGY.\nWe initially set out to build a dev tool for API integration, and while building in the integration space, we realized existing workflow automation tools have a few key limitations.

          "description": "Hi HN! We’re Adrien and Kanav. We met at our previous job, where we spent about a third of our lives combating a constant firehose of bugs. In the hope of reducing this pain for others in the future, we’re working on automating debugging.\nWe’re currently working on a platform that ingests logs and then automatically reproduces, root causes and ultimately fixes production bugs as they happen. You can see some of our work on this here - https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39528087\nAs we were building the root-cause phase of our automated debugger, we realized that we developed something that resembled an omniscient debugger. Like an omniscient debugger, it also keeps track of variable assignments over time but, you can interact with it at a higher level than a debugger using natural language. We ended up sticking it in a pytest plugin and have been using it ourselves for development over the past few weeks.\nUsing this pytest plugin, you’re able to reason at a much higher level than conventional debuggers and can ask questions like:\n- Why did function x get hit?\n- Why was variable y set to this value?\n- What changes can I make to this code to make this test pass?\nHere’s a brief demo of this in action: https://www.loom.com/share/94ebe34097a343c39876d7109f2a1428\nTo achieve this, we first instrument the test using sys.settrace (or, on versions of python >3.12, the far better sys.monitoring!) to keep a history of all the functions that were called, along with the calling line numbers. We then re-run the test and use AST parsing to find all the variable assignments and keep track of those changes over time. We also use AST parsing to obtain the source code for these functions. We then neatly format and pass all this context to GPT.\nWe’d love it if you checked the pytest plugin out and we welcome all feedback :) . If you want to chat bugs, our emails are also always open - kanav@leaping.io\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39791301\nPoints: 75\n# Comments: 14",

          "description": "Hey HN, we've built DaLMatian, a text2sql product that meets the needs of data analysts working with enterprise data. We built this app because as a data analyst at an enterprise I could not find a text2sql product that was (1) actually useful for my day-to-day and (2) easy to set up on my computer. Existing products either fall apart when tested on gnarly enterprise data/queries or require going through a sales/integration process that I wasn't in a position to push for - I just wanted something that I could quickly set up to help make my job easier. Our goal is to make this a reality for any data analyst that feels the same.\nThere are many constraints that make this reality difficult to achieve. The product needs to scale to databases with millions of columns and extract business logic from very complex queries. It also needs to be fast, at least faster than an analyst would take to write the query. On top of all this, an analyst needs to be allowed to use it from a security standpoint. Our app meets all the key requirements of an enterprise data analyst while also being lightweight enough to run locally on a typical laptop.\nHere's how it works. To get started, you simply need to open a file of past queries in our IDE (try it here: https://www.dalmatian.ai/download) and add a file with your database schema (instructions here: https://www.dalmatian.ai/docs#configuration). There is also an option to connect a database to auto pull your schema (no actual data is seen by the LLM). We do not see anything you input since the app is local and the only external connection is with OpenAI. It's just like asking ChatGPT for help with queries, but in a streamlined way.\nIf you'd download our free IDE and try to break it, we'd love to hear what you come up with!\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39781418\nPoints: 24\n# Comments: 7",

          "description": "Ragas is an open-source library for evaluating and testing RAG and other LLM applications. Github: https://docs.ragas.io/en/stable/, docs: https://docs.ragas.io/.\nRagas provides you with different sets of metrics and methods like synthetic test data generation to help you evaluate your RAG applications. Ragas started off by scratching our own itch for evaluating our RAG chatbots last year.\nProblems Ragas can solve\n- How do you choose the best components for your RAG, such as the retriever, reranker, and LLM?\n- How do you formulate a test dataset without spending tons of money and time?\nWe believe there needs to be an open-source standard for evaluating and testing LLM applications, and our vision is to build it for the community. We are tackling this challenge by evolving the ideas from the traditional ML lifecycle for LLM applications.\nML Testing Evolved for LLM Applications\nWe built Ragas on the principles of metrics-driven development and aim to develop and innovate techniques inspired by state-of-the-art research to solve the problems in evaluating and testing LLM applications.\nWe don't believe that the problem of evaluating and testing applications can be solved by building a fancy tracing tool; rather, we want to solve the problem from a layer under the stack. For this, we are introducing methods like automated synthetic test data curation, metrics, and feedback utilisation, which are inspired by lessons learned from deploying stochastic models in our careers as ML engineers.\nWhile currently focused on RAG pipelines, our goal is to extend Ragas for testing a wide array of compound systems, including those based on RAGs, agentic workflows, and various transformations.\nTry out Ragas here https://colab.research.google.com/github/shahules786/openai-... in Google Colab. Read our docs - https://docs.ragas.io/ to know more\nWe would love to hear feedback from the HN community :)\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39780114\nPoints: 56\n# Comments: 17",

          "description": "For the last 5 years I've been working on a layout engine that targets CSS2 and some more modern properties.\nLive demo: https://chearon.github.io/dropflow/\nIt matches browsers in all cases I can find where they agree, and it's fast. It supports `position`, `inline-block`, `z-index`, and complex properties like `float` and `vertical-align`. It doesn't support high-level layout like flexbox or grid yet, but you can get intrinsics to easily divide space yourself and paint multiple layout trees. It has a great text layout implementation, and supporting non-Latin scripts is a top priority.\nI've wanted this to exist as far back as 2013, and the desire kept coming up: for a way to get detailed intrinsics, for high quality rich text layout to canvas and SVG, and for server-side rich text. We currently use it in CellEngine for our new canvas-based spreadsheet library to layout text in hundreds of thousands of cells, and will be using it soon to render PDFs with thousands of pages in a few seconds.\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39778570\nPoints: 250\n# Comments: 85",

          "description": "Hi everyone!\nI’m excited to open source GritQL, a Rust CLI for searching and transforming source code.\nGritQL comes from my experiences with conducting large scale refactors and migrations.\nUsually, I would start exploring a codebase with grep. This is easy to start with, but most migrations end up accumulating additional requirements like ensuring the right packages are imported and excluding cases which don’t have a viable migration path.\nEventually, to build a complex migration, I usually ended up having to write a full codemod program with a tool like jscodeshift. This comes with its own problems:\n- Most of the exploratory work has to be abandoned as you figure out how to represent your original regex search as an AST.\n- Reading/writing a codemod requires mentally translating from AST names back to what source code actually looks like.\n- Performance is often an afterthought, so iterating on a large codemod can be painfully slow.\n- Codemod frameworks are language-specific, so if you’re hopping between multiple languages—or trying to migrate a shared API—you have to learn different tools.\nGritQL is an attempt to develop a powerful middle ground:\n- Exploratory analysis is easy: just put a code snippet in backticks and use $metavariables for placeholders.\n- Incrementally add complexity by introducing side conditions with where clauses.\n- Reuse named patterns to avoid rebuilding queries, and use shared patterns from our standard library for common tasks like ensuring modules are imported.\n- Iterate on large codebases quickly: we use Rust for maximum performance\nGritQL has already been used on thousands of repositories for complex migrations[1] but we're excited to collaborate more with the open source community.\n[1] Ex. https://github.com/openai/openai-python/discussions/742\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39770908\nPoints: 57\n# Comments: 16",

          "description": "Hi everybody, today I'm launching version 1.0 of Godspeed, a todo manager built with two priorities in mind: speed and 100% keyboard orientation. Every action in Godspeed can be done from your keyboard and will respond instantly. It's like Superhuman for your todo list.\nGodspeed has everything you expect in a todo manager like shared lists, labels, smart lists, boolean search operators, and cloud sync. If you're already a user of an app like Todoist or OmniFocus you should be able find everything you need in Godspeed.\nI think the most appealing thing to most HN users would be the keyboard orientation. Literally every single action in Godspeed is doable from your keyboard. I'm so serious about this that I built \"hardcore mode\" to completely disable the mouse - this both helps you break the habit of reaching for your mouse, and keeps us honest about 100% hotkey support.\nYou can fully customize the hotkeys, but if you're into Vim or Emacs you'll feel right at home by default.\nWe've got a 2 week free trial with no limitations, and then offer subscription or one-time purchase options.\nThanks for checking out Godspeed, I'd love to hear your feedback!\nhttps://godspeedapp.com/\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39756325\nPoints: 180\n# Comments: 132",

It's kind of like if Airtable/Notion built Salesforce today. https://okapicrm.com\nWhen I was fresh out of college, working for startups, Salesforce was this big mystery to me. It's the perpetual second screen for everyone in sales. They were building this gigantic obelisk downtown. What was this thing? And why did every salesperson I knew seem to live in it all day, and yet hate it so much?\nTurns out Salesforce is basically PhpMyAdmin for salespeople. It's just basically two things:\n1. A really generic database, and a UI for CRUDing your data.\n2. An API and ecosystem of integrations.\nIn other words, it's the back-office CRUD app to end all back-office CRUD apps.

          "description": "Unix is a simple and elegant OS and one of its core principals is to provide mechanism and avoid unnecessary policy decision. For example Microsoft Windows has an arbitrary policy that all executable should have .exe extension. In Unix any file can be an executable as long as it has the executable bit set. This philosophy was also followed when the original X11 was designed. The X11 server only provides mechanism, the actual look and feel of the desktop, or in other words the policy was left to the Window Manager (WM). The WM is a simple application which communicates with the X11 server via ICCCM (https://www.x.org/releases/X11R7.6/doc/xorg-docs/specs/ICCCM/icccm.html ). \n With Wayland the Window Manager and compositor are lumped together as one application. These are big applications with each having their own set of bugs and very little or no cooperation between the different compositor implementation. This rigid approach is also evident in a toolkit such as GTK which insists on client-side decoration (CSD) which again is an arbitrary policy decision.\n Seems to me that we have Microsoft Windows style developers working on the future Linux desktop and it will end up being as fragile and brittle as Windows.\n    submitted by    /u/Vasant1234  \n [link]   [comments]",

And no, most people do not review it. But the thing is, so does everything else.\n DEBs have post-/pre-installation scripts. So does NPM and PIP. And the AUR is just downloading and running a specially formatted build script (unless it's a binary package). And all of those are arguably harder to review than just downloading a shell script.\n The only proper package formats I'm aware of that do not have this issue are Flatpak and Snap. (Because sandboxing is awesome!)\n Downloading a package from someone's APT repo is just as insecure as running someone's shell script. If you trust that someone/organization, then great!

          "description": "TL;DR for anyone not wanting to read: An NVIDIA user tries Linux and encounters issues.\n Not long ago, I decided that I wanted to make the switch to Linux. So I went ahead and installed with installed the proprietary driver. However, I encountered quite a few bugs, so I tried Fedora 39 KDE, also with the proprietary driver. Unfortunately, I still had no luck. I then decided to give Arch a try, and I installed it along with KDE. Yet again, I encountered various bugs. Here are the gist of the issues I experienced with NVIDIA across all distros:\n  \nIn Wayland, resizing and moving windows wasn't a problem, but it was glitchy. Most games I tried flickered, and Chrome also glitched when resizing or during normal use.\n X11 wasn't as glitchy as Wayland, but it was extremely slow in every aspect, especially when resizing or moving windows. I tried installing the explicit sync patch from the AUR, but it didn't make a significant difference. Then I remembered that I had an Intel iGPU in my CPU, so I connected my monitors to the motherboard. After reinstalling the OS (for some reason, the iGPU didn't work unless I logged in with my monitor/s connected to the dGPU), it worked. The desktop was running on Mesa, and I was able to run games on the dGPU through prime-run. Problem solved? Absolutely not. The games started stuttering, presumably due to the whole iGPU situation. In the end, I regrettably had to switch back to Windows. The only thing preventing me from using Linux right now is the NVIDIA driver.\n  \nI want to emphasize that this is not a support post, I do not expect support.

It literally just works. I never have to restart it, never have to mess with adb, its amazing. It also supports 60fps and also seems to have better performance, idk maybe the android app has hardware acceleration or something or jsut uses a more efficient compression algo idk.\n the only problem is that I had to by droidcam obs pro for higher resolution support, even though I already had droidcamx, and it was $15 compared to the $6 of droidcamx, which kinda sucked, but idk this has been such a better experience.\n sorry idk this kinda just fixed all my webcam issues idk havent tried the windows client yet but im assuming it works better on there too\n    submitted by    /u/amaghon69  \n [link]   [comments]",

At this point EndeavourOS KDE (manjaro would work but don't want to install it) works quite well but on and off, not consistently enough. I know the Nvidia company issues and loath them like everyone else but it's not like I can just pull the Quadro and switch it for an AMD card. There is no way in the world am I installin a Distro on my main production work laptop - Thinkpad P1 gen 5 - it'll stay on Win11.\n On the positive side KDE 6 is fantastic! I'm a gnome guy but will run KDE now.\n    submitted by    /u/getbusyliving_  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I've poked around on the internet quite a bit but I've found very little information. Supposedly (as of over 10 years ago according to the few threads I've found) the scheduler is triggered every time the interrupt timer fires, which implies that adjusting the timer frequency changes the scheduler timeslice. Shouldn't that have an impact on latency/throughput? If that's the case:\n  \nWhy is it only settable at compile time? The kernel gained support for setting the preemption model at boottime and at runtime a while ago. Is the difference from changing the interrupt timer frequency that negligible that no one has bothered making it at least make it settable on the kernel command line even with a non-upstreamed patch? Is there some other technical reason? I have no idea if hardware supports changing it at runtime.\n \nDifferent distros set it to a different value. How much does this change influence their performance in different scenarios? To name a few, Debian and Ubuntu use 250Hz, Arch uses 300Hz, and Fedora and Void use 1000Hz. Of note, the XanMod kernel packaged for Debian/Ubuntu keeps the default 250Hz, which is interesting if aiming for the best latency.\n \n ​\n As far as I've looked, no one has done comprehensive benchmarks on the effect of changing the interrupt timer frequency.

          "description": "I recently switched to Fedora 39 and noticed that apparently the behavior of the --no-clobber (aka -n) option in cp / mv breaks behavior of all past gnu coreutil versions.\n Like the guy responding in the linked email list, I am extremely surprised that they chose to break backward compatibility with how the option worked in previous versions\n I guess for people that only use 1 distro or don't have scripts they share between machines of different distros, maybe it's a simple update.. but all the same, this is pretty annoying IMO.\n btw for anybody wondering, the recommended resolution AFAICT is to just update all of your scripts to use (cp --update=none ... and, no, there does not appear to be any short option for --update=none either).\n For me, since I am not entirely on one distro, I am having to update my scripts to check if the option is supported and handle it one way if it is or use --no-clobber if the distro has an older version which is why I'm slightly peeved by the decision to handle things this way. Anybody else frustrated by this? Or am I just being sour over having to update my scripts and them suddenly modifying -n to match BSD was really that big of a benefit to warrant breaking years of backward compatibility on Linux?\n edit: since apparently the link doesn't really mention it much? The main issue that originally made me aware of the change is that the ignored files are no longer silent and cp/mv generate terminal output for each ignored file.\n Also, as /u/LvS and /u/pixelbeat_ mention below: apparently this behavior is rolled back in 9.5 and so is only an issue from 9.2 to 9.4 inclusive (with the old behavior patched back in for Debian version of the package). So the scope is much less than I had originally thought.\n    submitted by    /u/snyone  \n [link]   [comments]",

But it's not a good experience imo. .\n So I have to ask you other blind Linux users. How do you browse the web in the most convenient way on Linux? Can you please take me through each step if you need to read a forum, Stackoverflow or article for example? How do you focus textfields or find the next header etc. ?\n I'm thinking about trying the following:\n Step 1: Load webpage with Lynx into a text file.\n Step 2: Open the text file with nano or any preferred text editor. \n Step 3: Use keyboard to move the caret and read line by line with Orca inside the text editor, viewing the web page loaded with Lynx.\n The annoying thing with this though is that I can't easily open a link or find links, headings, buttons, textfields and other controls.\n So how do you do it?\n Thanks!

Their reasons (mostly my dad, he’s the most argumentative) for it was that “Windows is better”, “you can break the computer”, (mom) “I bought a Linux computer and it was so complicated we trashed it”\n First of all the only damage you can actually do in the installation process is wiping your hard drive by actually installing the distro after placing the flash drive with the ISO on Boot Order #1, and secondly Windows is so shit and criminal that you’re better off using Red Star OS for your day to day activities.\n I have used an emulator for Linux Mint but I have never actually booted the ISO up, and I wonder what you guys have to give as advice.

          "description": "So, I watched a video today talking about a proposal on fedora to change the default DE from gnome to kde and they were advocating that it would be better for new linux users.\n I know many people don't like the opinionated nature of gnome or don't think kde is \"windows like\"... And that's fair. But since the point is about new users that mainly comes from windows I will give my point, as I am a relative new user coming from windows:\n When used to windows you are expecting things to behave like windows. Actually many people are not only used to, they do everything on a computer since they are born in windows... From gaming to academics. \n Then, when you try to change and find something very similar to windows (in terms of workflow) and things don't behave like windows, it brings a feeling that it's cheap or that it doesn't work, causing frustration or a sense of need to go back to windows. Doesn't matter that kde is in a very polished state today it will never behave exactly like windows, because it's linux.\n I say that because it happened to me when I tried to switch for the first time. (for other reasons I kept trying)\n So, on one of my attempts I tried gnome, and: \n it's so different from windows workflow (focus on workspaces, less menus, less minimize and maximize, concise visuals) my mindset changed and I started to face linux as an entirely different thing with a different paradigm.\n That's why I think gnome is a good choice for new users. Not because it's better thank other DEs but because it's different. If you are an user that needs to tinker more you will naturally go after something else after a while.\n Anyway, since then I moved to window managers and I'm happy, but it would not happened that easy if I kept trying to find windows on desktop linux.\n    submitted by    /u/bvgross  \n [link]   [comments]",

I loved the Gnome UI it looks beautiful and it is so fast and snappy and there is so much customisation. In the beginning I was scared of the terminal but I was actually quite surprised that I didn't even have to use it that much and in most cases there was a way to do the task through the GUI anyway. I loved that I could just go to the store to download the applications directly, no more going to Google to search for a site, then find a download link then download and all that crap. And that's where the good things end. I found that most of the time I was just fixing problems that I was experiencing instead of being productive. Davinci resolve would just crash out of nowhere, will start lagging or there will be random black screens. The hardest part was lack of apps. I can't work without office and the web versions weren't as intuitive. There are alternatives like libre office or open office but they lack a lot of advance features that I use. I use Nvidia broadcast a lot but the app isn't supported. File management is another thing that took me a long time to figure out but there are still problems that I wasn't able to solve. I really wanted to go through with it. I wanted to love the experience but I guess it just isn't for me.\n    submitted by    /u/Blluueee  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hey r/linux, with the recent news about the backdoor discovered in xz-utils, it got me thinking about Ventoy, a tool that makes it easy to create bootable USB drives for tons of ISOs, even pfSense and VMware ESXi are supported.\n I looked briefly at the source code, there are some red flags:\n  \nA lot of binary blobs in the source tree, even those that could be compiled from source (grub, zstd, etc). Always sketchy for a project claiming to be fully open-source.\n The Arch User Repository PKGBUILD for it is a monster - over 1300 lines! The packager even ranted that it's a \"packaging nightmare\" and complains that upstream expects you to build on CentOS 7.\n The build process uses ancient software like a 2008 version of device-mapper. WTF?\n  \nAll of this makes the source extremely difficult to properly audit. And that's scary, because a malicious backdoor in a tool like Ventoy that people use to boot their systems could be devastating, especially given how popular it's become with Linux newbies who are less likely to be scrutinizing the code.\n Am I being paranoid here? I'm no security expert, but I can't shake the feeling that Ventoy is a prime target for bad actors to sneak something in.\n    submitted by    /u/thwurx10  \n [link]   [comments]",

A log inspection script that takes a minute with rsyslogd would take a year with systemd. Clearly journalctl was not designed to scale, as it looks like it's loading the entire log history into RAM in chunks before answering. rsyslogd bins logs by app and date so only what is needed is read from disk, and only just enough lines at a time in RAM to benefit from buffer speed.\n Edit (thanks small_kimono ):\n Or at least avoid using any journalctl features:\n /usr/bin/time -v journalctl | grep -P \" $APP/.*$EG\" Elapsed (wall clock) time (h:mm:ss or m:ss): 0:21.11 Maximum resident set size (kbytes): 322,456 \n unlike unit, grep is not quite as horrific:\n /usr/bin/time -v journalctl -g $EG | grep \" $APP/\" Elapsed (wall clock) time (h:mm:ss or m:ss): 0:08.43 Maximum resident set size (kbytes): 317,452 \n Still 2 orders of magnitude worse for speed and RAM, so stick to rsyslogd if you have an nontrivial log operations.\n    submitted by    /u/elatllat  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hey folks!\n Many of us, probably almost everyone by now, have been following the XZ Utils situation. \n There have been many takes on how this was possible at all, both from the technical and the community point of view. The most security conscious have been overtaken by a sense of unease, especially as the most obvious question is posed: \"how many times has this happened?\".\n This level of paranoia is certainly warranted, it always was as some are coming to realize, but I would like us all to remind people that systems are not only valuable due to their inherent robustness. Systems and software are also valuable, robust as well as secure due to the checks and balances within the processes that create them and act as fail-safes when said robustness is compromised.\n Some are looking for culpability in FOSS, but a point I feel we should echo louder is that although FOSS might have delivered on its weaknesses it also, and most importantly, delivered on its strengths. This time we were lucky, and this constitutes an opportunity to galvanize the FOSS community and strengthen the processes and principles that have moved it forward.\n I'd be happy to hear your thoughts!\n    submitted by    /u/jdsalaro  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hello I would like to discuss the topic of Linux Desktop and Linux Servers. Linux is pretty much the go-to in the server world, but the Desktop might be dragging a bit behind. Why is the case? \n Big companies do not favor developing for Linux and the low market share probably isn’t the only reason. Could it be because the Linux Desktop is so diverse that compatibility issues arise? \n Would it be better if Linux was more standardised in terms of distributions and desktop environments? What would need to change for the Desktop in order to accelerate forward?\n I am open to read your thoughts on this!\n ***Please remember about manners in the comments, as the topic might get a little controversial.

          "description": "**EDIT*\\* To be more specific, would antivirus protect potential user when the database is uploaded for this incident??**EDIT\n I understand that no Operating System is 100% safe. Although this backdoor is likely only affects certain Linux desktop users, particularly those running unstable Debian or testing builds of Fedora (like versions 40 or 41), Could this be a sign that antivirus software should be more widely used on Linux desktops?\n ( I know this time is a zero-day attack)\n *What if*, malicious code like this isn't discovered until after it's released to the public? For example, imagine it was included in the initial release of Fedora 40 in April. What if other malware is already widespread and affects more than just SSH, unlike this specific case?\n My point is,\n  \nMany people believe that Linux desktops don't require antivirus software.\n Antivirus can at least stop malware once it's discovered.\n Open-source software is protected by many parties, but a backdoor like this one, which reportedly took 2 years to plan and execute, raises my concern about being more cautious when choosing project code maintainers.\n Linux desktops will likely be targeted by more attacks as they become more popular.\n  \nIMO, antivirus does not save stupid people(who blindly disable antivirus // grant root permission) but it does save some lazy people.\n OS rely heavily on users practicing caution and up-to-date(both knowledge and the system). While many users don't follow tech news, they could unknowingly be running (this/any) malware without ever knowing. They might also neglect system updates, despite recommendations from distro maintainers.\n  \nThis is where antivirus software can be useful. In such cases, users might be somewhat protected once the backdoor signature is added to the antivirus database.\n  \nThankfully, the Linux community and Andres Freund responded quickly to this incident.\n    submitted by    /u/curie64hkg  \n [link]   [comments]",

I learned something each time since I had to diagnose it and fix it, and it gets more fun each time because its a realization of I am in complete control of my system.\n That is something I never had in Windows.

The community is very helpful (apart from a few people on this sub reddit lol)\n Also, gaming has came a LONG way!

I was not allowed access to the internet growing up and never owned my own computer. But that did not stop me from finding ways on it. I was actively on the internet by using the iPod touch (before it was an iPhone) when they released WiFi capabilities on the Itouch. \n He got me a Chromebook and the very first thing I did was open google and head to oldschool.runescape.com. Jagex had JUST released OSRS and absolutely needed the nostalgia of flash1:wave2:cyan: buying gf1111!111!!!\n I was almost ready to play. All I had to do was install Java. Turns out, ChromeOS did not support Java.\n Not me googling, “how to hack your computer to install unsupported applications”\n Lo and behold, I discovered Ubuntu and dual booted it.

          "description": "I've recently been trying to better my understanding of core Linux concepts, and I want to test that knowledge... so, please help me out by critiquing my understanding of Firmware and Drivers.\n From what I've read, firmware is the code that makes hardware actually function on the lowest level, and it provides an API to simplify the general actions hardware can perform... like a speaker raising and lowering volume by altering input voltages. Then a driver's built to interact with that API endpoint to provide abstracted functionality of the hardware to the kernel.\n I think of this like interacting with a website. The website backend, like firmware, provides API endpoints for interacting with the websites core functionality (like reading and writing to and from databases). Then an example of a driver would be your browser & search engine interacting with the backend API to provide you with web pages, or to upload your data.\n I use to wonder why drivers didn't just interact with the hardware themselves, removing the need for firmware... but this would be the equivalent of your browser having to know how to run an sql query for user data on your websites backend, instead of having a backend API built by someone who can specifiy exactly how the database(s) should be interacted with, preventing any unsafe operations.\n    submitted by    /u/No-Tension2655  \n [link]   [comments]",

And then there are the various appliances and fancy gadgets running Linux, which also involve a physical component (making them a paid product by default).\n But what about an individual or small independent team pouring their souls into a private software project and then trying to use it to earn an income? Is there any room in the Linux ecosystem for that 'business' model?\n I've donated to some of my favorite developers - including a handful of one-man bands - but something tells me a donation now and then isn't how they pay the bills.\n Somewhere along the way I developed this fantasy of really investing myself in my software projects and turning them into an income, but it just doesn't seem feasible, at least with Linux. The prospect of hiring onto a company completely ruins the whole idea of programming as a vocation for me.\n Any successful small teams or individuals out there?

I won't go into the specifics of how I got the file size so low as that would be more appropriate for another group of people like r/asm or the people of GitHub (should I get a GitHub account and post the source there?), All that I'll mention here is that I succeeded and got the file size down to 977 bytes, and the steps to run it from that qrcode up there.\n Yep, I did what a few people have done when it comes to small programs, notably MattKC and Dave's Garage and put my little webserver in a qrcode.\n Warning: I trust my code to be safe and free of malware, but you shouldn't. Do not run any code you find online on your own machine. Please use a VM or a disposable device.\n Now to those of you who have either of these things (or just don't care) heres what to do.\n 1: scan the qrcode with zbarimg -1 --raw -Sbinary path/to/png > path/to/exe\n Note: zbar had an issue quite a while ago where it would fail to read qrcodes like this making the program unable to be run, please update zbarimg to the latest version or build it from source.\n 2: make it executable with chmod +x path/to/exe\n 3: run it with ./path/to/exe\n 4: connect to it. The port should be port 4050 so connecting to it should be as simple as going to localhost:4050 or 127.0.0.1:4050 in your webbrowser.\n I might make a GitHub account and post the source there. I'm just not sure that making a GitHub account souly for a Makefile and a 200 line asm file is a good idea.\n Either way, I hope you like it.\n    submitted by    /u/Skeleton590  \n [link]   [comments]",

Just like Windows does.\n You know, you just update a font and it's needlessly asking for a reboot. Just in case.\n Besides the fact that this seems utterly backwards on a server-class operating system like Linux, which is now even capable of updating the kernel without reboot via an appropriate service, to regress back to unnecessary consumer-desktop-class behaviour, isn't this also counter to the whole purpose of their \"snap\" format?\n In that containers seek to further isolate components from one another, so you can restart a container to refresh it, without needing to touch anything else about the system.

This is a huge architectural improvement for Inkscape, and will enable proper graphics acceleration in the future.\n This quick transition - only about 9 months - was made possible by donations, as the Inkscape project invested approx. $80,000 towards it. Support Inkscape's development: https://inkscape.org/support-us/donate/\n A lot of issues remain to be found and solved, especially on MacOS and Windows, so the next release will still use GTK3.

In comes KDE 6 w Wayland... nothing I do fixes the suspending bugs, and I'm basically forced to switch to GNOME after things get so messy that I have to reinstall arch due to the desktop crashing during pacman updates. So I switch to GNOME, which is a bit better, but the instability is still just... so bad. Brightness control is completely broken when I'm in hybrid graphics mode, even when I'm just using plain old X11 - it stays at 100% no matter what (at least KDE could implement acpi_backlight=nvidia_wmi_ec correctly). I can't really use wayland because of glitching and flickering on XWayland that messes up chrome, again something that KDE actually does correctly despite Nvidia's crappy driver... I can't logout and log back in sometimes when I'm on hybrid graphics mode...\n Basically the only working Wayland implemention is KDE's, which is very unstable right now. GNOME's just completely shits the bed anytime an XWayland application is needed on Nvidia hardware, and it's already a pita for anything hybrid graphics related compared to KDE when it's actually stable. The only option I have for a usable system right now is to turn off hybrid graphics, use GNOME on X11 and have my laptop die in the middle of classes. I'm seriously considering going back to Windows for a couple months because it just seems like there will be more issues and they will continue to get worse until things are (maybe) resolved later\n    submitted by    /u/espercent  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I have been several years testing distros, not so many to be honest, but there have been a bunch. Up to this point, I reached the thinking that if you want to have a stable distro, your main choice is Debian, while in contrary, if you want bleeding edge packages, you may run Arch (or another rolling release). Yes, there are a lot of different distros out there, but to me feels like you can achieve most of what they can do with Arch or Debian, because they are basically forks of them (kinda I'm at the sustainable peak at the Linux Dunning-krugger effect).\n ​\n Now I use Debian, but for me, pisses me off not receiving updates for weeks. The system is pretty stable, and is a solid base, but that fact, pisses me off. I used to have (and love) Fedora, which, for me, was that sweet spot between rolling release and stable release, but how RHEL behaves lately, pisses me off, and sadly, it made me move away from Fedora. So yeah, I try to stay away from the more \"corporative/privative-like\" distros (so yeah, no Ubuntu also), because if I had to go with that, I'd just stick to Windows.\n ​\n So yeah. I cannot feel relaxed with Arch with the possibility to breaking up just updating the system (I know is something you can avoid if you stay away from AUR, but still is a posibility), and I am tired of falling behind on updates for being in Debian, so I am ready to test new things. Maybe, I can give another opportunity to Arch, or even, try new stuff, such as Open SUSE for example, but I would like to know if the specific distro you might suggest receives updates from time to time, and also, if it is stable, and I can feel relaxed on the system breaking on me.\n [EDIT]: Some of you have said me that RHEL is an upstream of Fedora, and not the other way around, so sorry for the inconvenience, and that may be an option. Also, for now, I have also considered openSUSE Tumbleweed, but I have to give it a try firstly.\n    submitted by    /u/Raulduri  \n [link]   [comments]",

I wanted to use the plethora of iTerm2 color schemes on Linux and I found a project on GitHub that could do it, but I had to tweak code to make it work. I then found that it only did half the job. You have to append the list of profile ID in dconf or the profile, while imported, won't be available for use.\n The basis for my code was this repo. It kinda works but, like I said, I had to tweak it make it fully usable. I created a new repo, and I did credit the original because their work helped me accomplish my goal.\n I hope you find it useful.

So threw hands in the air and started binging Linux OS videos on YouTube. \n My initial attempts were with virtual box... couldn't get it to work. So ended up creating USB ISO files and just sorta kept failing at booting or installing distros until FINALLY, I just totally replaced Windows with Zorin 17.1 OS.

More like a well-used car that has a good paint job still.\n I know, I know. Some of you are going to claim this doesn’t apply to Linux since Linux is an OS or kernel, with a billion different flavors, and not a website. \n But we have been seeing it in Windows IMO since version 8 or 10. Maybe sooner for some folks. We’ve seen it in iOS as the fruit phones and laptops, etc. have not really put out anything mind-blowing or usefully new except the M1 chip.\n When is the last time NVIDIA or AMD really put out something huge like we used to see back in the day? I’m talking GPU, not CPU. The fact that Intel could create their own dGPU and start releasing products at the midrange audience in their first generation of Arc cards should cause a question to form.\n Linux seems to be the only thing that I use on a daily basis that hasn’t started this platform decaying yet. Is it because we are forced to learn how to use Linux, or maybe we see this cool programs like Vi or Kile, maybe a command like awk or grep, and we fixate on it until we beat it to death and move on to the next thing? Or is it that we keep learning because we want to learn more?\n Mind you, I’m not an analyst or even have a college degree.

Also, it's pre installed, when you go to a regular store all the laptops have windows installed unless they're MAC's, heck, many people don't even know what an operating system is.\n Somebody pointed out, that there's so many distros people would have dilemma which one to choose, so somebody proposed that making a 'general'/'official', user friendly distro which would be marketed and advertised, and it would be the default option to consider for companies making software would help it.\n Because proprietary there's a whole company, but there are many Linux distros (not like it's bad, but i'm speaking of general users)\n    submitted by    /u/exiled-redditor  \n [link]   [comments]",

So how does the community ensure the quality and standard of the code base?\n The reason behind asking this question is, I work for a large company where there are say around 50 developers across two development centers (both in different countries) and we are having this problem where we are not able to maintain the modularity of the code. The developers in our center develop the code differently, the developers in other country develop it differently. This difference is causing a lot of problems. Because when we use their base code, we are not able to modify it as efficiently as we should. And I think they face the similar problem. \n So what process does Linux uses to maintain the quality, especially the modularity of the code base?\n    submitted by    /u/4ChawanniGhodePe  \n [link]   [comments]",

There are plenty of good free powerful software that are windows only. Plus, all of my game library with my Nvidia card.\n Now, I have spent most of my adult life using Linux. I discovered it as a teenager but it took some time for me to fully transition. Now at 33 nearly 34, it is more comfortable to me than any other system, way above macOS which still use because MacBooks are the best laptops for me.\n The point of this post is that while I don't feel I wasted my time, it has made me appreciate what I truly value in a computing system and in life in general: Having as much control of your environment as possible.\n I recently started photographing again, and where I thought I would be using good software exlusive to windows, the best are open source and available in all platforms. I do not use LightRoom, I will never pay Adobe. I will miss the proprietary software that the camera companies make for editing RAW files, but I have so many options it does not matter.\n Gaming is a trifle now. The kind of games I like to play can either run on proton or have a linux release. \n More than can control, it is owning the production. It feels so limiting to ever wait on companies to make the things you want. Something propriety is not something I can own. The world I want to live in is one where information is freely shared, bettering everyone.\n I will now end this poorly thought out rant and rave.\n    submitted by    /u/DestructiveDumbass  \n [link]   [comments]",

I tracked either the generic package or a shell/wm package for these stats. Of course a lot of discrepancies come from Debian being more of an enterprise/stable distro, for example more KDE users would most likely be on Arch instead.\n Out of 135773 downloads:\n * GNOME (gnome-shell) - 44.15%\n * XFCE4 (xfwm4) - 23.3%\n * KDE Plasma (plasma-desktop) - 18.72%\n * Cinnamon (cinnamon-desktop-environment) - 7.5%\n * LXQT (lxqt) - 3.63%\n * i3wm (i3-wm) - 2.7%\n * Sway (sway) - 0.91%\n    submitted by    /u/ThePix13  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "So I've gotten so fed up of all the nonsense posts of people complaining about Linux being a cult since it doesn't work for them, that I wanted to share a positive experience of my own.\n I recently decided to offer my services to become a part of the AV team at a church I've been attending since they really only have a couple of guys that that entire system depends on. Upon stepping into the booth and starting to learn about how the mixerboard and basic AV setup works, I noticed 2 separate PCs set up - a basic HP gaming laptop running only Streamlabs for the live feed and a second desktop that basically does everything else (recording, playing videos/music, sharing song lyrics on the remote dual mounted displays, etc). I noticed that the desktop was running Ubuntu Mate and asked the AV guy about it. Simply put, his response was \"It just works and the lower headroom of Linux completely eliminated random freezing and glitches during church services\".\n To be fair, the desktop itself was running an older Pentium processor with only 4 GB of RAM, but the fact that the church's reason for using Linux to essentially power their daily services because it \"simply works\" was a really eye-opening experience for me and a reminder that Linux as a desktop is definitely not just a hobbyist OS and gave me an even greater level of respect for the open source apps that we often take for granted.\n    submitted by    /u/chozendude  \n [link]   [comments]",

The rendering itself is amazing with defaults; however, the biggest problem was the regular weight font thinness on small sizes with grayscale antialiasing (AA). Subpixel AA is a no-go for me, as my eyes simply cannot stand its color fringing. Thus began my journey to \"perfection\".\n A few months before I started gathering all the information and made a small project with a set of advanced tweaks for FreeType, including customized stem-darkening with multiple presets to make it more pleasing to the eye, and just finished setting up a public repository.\n Without further ado, if anyone is interested in trying it, here it is: https://github.com/maximilionus/freetype-envision\n Project is still young, no packages are yet available, but a small install-uninstall scripts with a \"nice\" README are already here. Will be happy to hear your opinions, thoughts and suggestions.\n Visual comparison here.\n    submitted by    /u/maximilionus  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I got the Oneplus 12 because of its DC dimming and higher PWM at lower brightness, but after a week with it, I was itching to switch back to my S23 Ultra. Thoughts:\n Negatives: 1) Nova Launcher doesn't work smoothly with gesture controls, there's a noticeable lag when I swipe to home. I thought it won't be a big deal, but couldn't stand it after a few days. \n 2) I miss the One Hand Application app for Samsung, that gave me a bunch of side of the screen gesture actions. I tried a few apps off the Google play store but I couldn't find one as reliable. \n 3) I miss the S pen, good for precise actions, remote camera triggers, and the occasional live sketch. \n 4a) I found the colors on the Samsung generally more accurate, with the Oneplus giving most photos a warmer tint than irl. Oneplus sometimes seem to have sharper images though, but that might be due to processing. Night photos and videos seem better on the Samsung. \n 4b) I also miss the 10x camera, which is great for travel and animal photography. \n 4c) No motion photos on the default oneplus camera app. I like the little snippets of video attached to each photo.\n 5) One UI just feels more polished as an OS, more finalized and less improvised. \n 6) Samsung Pay turns NFC on and off automatically which seems more secure to me. \n Positives 1) The screen does feel slightly more comfortable on the OnePlus, so I might switch back to it if my eye strain comes back. I can see the flicker in the Samsung if I wave my fingers across the screen when it's dim.\n 2) I can't seem to get true blacks in dark mode in a few apps on the Samsung, like Instapaper, while the Oneplus has it. \n 3) Screen off gestures are pretty convenient on the oneplus, especially the torch.\n 4) The oneplus is lighter and less bulky. \n 5) The haptics are stronger and feel more satisfying on the oneplus. \n 6) Battery life seems longer and charging is faster. \n Anyone have thoughts that might make me change my mind again? \n    submitted by    /u/onedeering  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "大家好，我是 Python 猫 的主理人，目前在创作《 Python 潮流周刊》。\n之前曾说周刊不做订阅制的，现在却推出了订阅专栏。今天想为自己辩护一下，同时聊聊技术周刊今后的发展计划。如果你在读后感兴趣，欢迎订阅！\n首先回顾一下我过去的想法吧，然后再解释为什么会突然出现转变。\n出于对 Python 的热爱以及对国外几个 Python 周刊的效仿，我从一年前开始连载《 Python 潮流周刊》。在这段时间里，我一直有把商业变现放在心上，只不过它的优先级并没有太靠前。\n我一边想着先把内容做好先积攒影响力，一边看着几份英文 Python 周刊的变现模式而盲目乐观着。\n在发布第 30 期之前，我侥幸接到了一两期商业赞助，那时我得意以为终于要熬出头了，终于可以像那些英文周刊一样，用“免费+品牌赞助”的方式运营了。\n于是意气风发地写了一篇《聊聊技术周刊的变现》，那时的我完全没有意识到下面的话是多么的理想主义：\n我比较在意的回报有两类，而且希望能同时得到，一类是关注量、阅读量、star 数、点赞量等等数据带来的精神鼓舞，另一类是广告/恰饭带来的实实在在的金钱。\n回到周刊变现的话题，因为第一类回报，所以我不打算做私密性周刊，不打算用订阅制，不打算收会员费；因为第二类回报，所以我会坚持探索挣钱之道。\n以上说法归结起来其实就是：我不想向读者收费，只想向广告主收费。\n如果我的读者群体已经很大了，如果每期阅读量都稳定很高了，比如像《科技爱好者周刊》和《 HelloGithub 》那样，这条路也许会顺畅很多。\n但现实是，Python 编程在国内的受众还是偏少，能关注到 Python 猫的也不算多，而最近两三年来，Python 类广告投放也出现了断崖式萎缩。\n或许因为我的内容太过垂直于 Python 领域，导致其它技术方向的广告主望而却步了，同时又因为不够垂直于爬虫/数据分析/AI 等几个热门的培训…",

          "description": "作为一个开发者，经常需要在多个设备之间传输文件/文本之类，我有 4 个手机两台电脑，相互传输个文件，非常不方便，当时（ 2020 年的时候）记得也有一些跨平台传输工具，但是都差点意思，要么只有手机端，要么只有网页，还特别不稳定，其实当时就想做这个产品，无奈不会桌面端，就一直忍受着这种不方便，用微信 QQ 之类的工具传输，虽然不是高频，但是需要用到的时候真的是特别苦恼。\n2023 年的时候，我经历了 Flutter 从 0.9 - 3.0 版本，表现越来越稳定，生态越来越健全，想要的功能插件基本上都能找到，使用 Flutter 开发桌面端的软件也越来越多，一直用 Flutter 做移动端的我，总是做做桌面端，看看 Flutter 的表现如何，同时也能满足文件传输的需求，由于是业余时间做，所以这个项目从开始要上线，用了大概 8 、9 个月的时间，中间因为各种事情，搁置了一段时间，iOS 开发账号注册又弄了 2 个月，从年初到年底，终于是上线了，看着自己做的产品终于要面世了，还是有点激动的，这款产品耗费了很多精力和时间，也满足了我的所有需求，而 Flutter 的表现是远超出我的预期，同时也墙裂建议同学们如果有做多端需求的项目，上 Flutter 。\n其实产品开发了一半的时候，github 上发现了 localsend ，因为也是 Flutter 开发的，体验了一下，当时就坚定了我继续用 Flutter 开发桌面端，因为体验确实还不错，虽然交互确实有点麻烦，不够易用，但是总体来说还行。\n去年年底上线后，为了更好的体验，又内部测试了一段时间，从体验上继续优化，，每天也是高频使用，我想把核心功能做到极致，我不想再像之前一样电脑上传个文件到手机上抓耳挠腮的半天没弄好，针对移动端和桌面端不同的交互习惯，分别做了非常多的细节处理，可能你永远不会发现。\n由于国内的繁杂手续，我们短时间内不会上架国内（海外走上正规了再上架国内市场），正好也尝试一下海外市场，感受了一下‘出海’氛围，目前还在公测阶段，基本上没任何推广动作，这样目前已有十几个国家的用户付费，给了我很大的震撼，果然是海外用户付费意识成熟。\n我们想要做的是：现代设计、极速稳定、打开即用的跨平台文件传输工具\n也会一直保持这个理念完善产品。\n最后: 上链接：Airclap\n如果觉得还可以的话，帮忙点个 star，感谢各位。",

          "description": "什么是新流系列软件\n当下越来越多的应用搬到了云上，这给用户带来了方便，但也带来了一些问题。\n第一，用户的数据和隐私安全问题。云上的应用，数据和应用的控制权由软件厂商牢牢把控，用户在软件厂商面前如同裸奔，对用户的数据和隐私安全的保护，全靠软件厂商的良心。大家知道，国内的软件厂商通常是没有良心的。国外的可能有点，但也不多。\n第二，没完没了的付费问题。云上的应用走的都是互联网的老套路，先免费，等到你被平台深度绑定的时候，再收费。不交钱？那就加广告，再各种限制你，反正有的是办法。订阅制的付费模式，只要你还在使用，就要一直付费，长期来看，使用成本还是很高的。\n新流系列软件是对软件模式的一种新的探索，它的目标是在用户的数据和隐私保护，跨设备使用便利性，以及软件使用成本上取得一种平衡，给用户更多一种的选择。\n简单来说，新流系列软件遵循三条新流软件标准\n第一，不注册，不联网，本地存储，离线运行，是完全的本地应用程序。用户拥有对数据和软件绝对的控制权，用户的数据和隐私安全也有绝对的保障。\n第二，支持 Windows 、macOS 、Linux 、iOS 、Android 、Web 等几乎所有主流平台。通过新流互联，支持在任意平台间进行应用流转和数据流转。\n第三，拒绝订阅制，告别没完没了的付费。一次付费，所有平台永久使用，永久可用。\n关于新流密码\n新流密码是一个密码管理应用，它完全遵循了新流软件的三大标准，本地存储，离线运行，多平台支持，跨设备访问。买断制，相对订阅制也能很好的降低用户的使用成本，特别是对于密码管理这种使用频度很低的应用来说。\n在功能上，新流密码支持多账号，方便小号管理。支持安全密码生成，支持查看密码历史。对了，还支持添加附件，这在保存一些证书，密钥时会非常有用。\n在进行跨平台访问时，对数据的点对点传输都进行了加密，以保证数据安全性。\n在使用上，建议用户将应用安装到手机上，当需要跨平台使用时，通过新流互联，将应用流转到其他平台上进行使用。\n关于新流互联，新流互联支持基于局域网或者 IPV6 公网内的跨设备访问，支持DDNS 动态域名绑定，通过自定义域名访问设备。（根据我的观察，目前手机蜂窝网络分配到的已经是 IPV6 地址了，家庭宽带也都基本支持 IPV6 。）\n为什么想写一个密码管理应用\n还记得很多年以前，我只有一个银行卡密码。再后来有了电脑以后，就是几个社交账号论坛的密码。再到后来互联网流行了以后，各种密码也是越来越多了。直到最近几年，特别是云计算流行了以后，什么东西都上了云了，就什么东西都变成了账号密码了。。。\n密码越来越多以后，忘记密码的事情就时有发生。于是就用了 LastPass ，我把我所有的密码都放在了上面。其实我也不怎么用它，平时我都是登录以后就记住密码的。只有在换了新设备或者重装系统以后，偶尔登上去，查一下密码。这个 LastPass 安不安全我不好说，但是因为是国外的软件，每次登录都特别的慢，而且只要换了 IP 登录，就要验证邮箱，非常繁琐。最近几年更是经常爆出被黑的新闻，心里总还是有点担心的。于是就有了今天的新流密码。\n大概就是这样了吧，相关截图和下载地址可以访问 新流软件官网: https://www.xinflow.cn",

          "description": "先发图，证明有车，不是无车黑。\n\n一、以大家最了解的油车为例子，油车驾驶过程，可以分为三种状态：\n1.加速 2.滑行 3.刹车\n我这里就不提其他电车了，免得更乱，只提特斯拉。特斯拉的驾驶过程，只有两种状态：\n1.加速 2.刹车\n有油车用户说：动能回收，跟我滑行，有什么区别？\n答：你那个滑行，能滑很远，特斯拉松了刹车也就滑百十米，真的不一样。\n明确的说：特斯拉日常驾驶中，不能备刹车，备不了。动能回收开到弱，也备不了，特斯拉的弱动能回收，其实也不弱。\n当然不排除有人为了抬杠，开到 100 多，把脚挪过去呆几秒，没必要，真车主都知道啥情况。\n----\n以上说的是单踏板吗？不是，只是很多人连上面的都没绕明白。\n----\n二、那到底什么是单踏板，不是动能回收吗？\n答：动能回收+保持模式，才是单踏板。\n保持模式是特斯拉的一个设置项，有 3 个选项：\n1. 缓行 2.转动 3.保持\n缓行：挂挡后，不踩油门，车辆也可以慢慢往前走。(大部分油车就这样)\n转动：挂挡后，不踩油门不走，斜坡会溜。\n保持：挂档后，不踩油门不走，斜坡不会溜。（传说中的单踏板模式）\n选择保持模式后，车子就可以做到：\n- 抬脚刹车，可以完全减速为 0 ，所以可以全程不踩刹车踏板\n- 抬脚刹车，可以完全减速为 0 ，所以可以全程不踩刹车踏板\n- 抬脚刹车，可以完全减速为 0 ，所以可以全程不踩刹车踏板\n选择缓行模式，车子：\n- 抬脚刹车，但无法完全减速为 0 ，想要停车还得踩刹车踏板\n- 抬脚刹车，但无法完全减速为 0 ，想要停车还得踩刹车踏板\n- 抬脚刹车，但无法完全减速为 0 ，想要停车还得踩刹车踏板\n这就是保持和缓行的区别，也是真正的单踏板模式。\n----\n以上说的是完整的单踏板模式吗？依然不是。以上只是客观的进入单踏板模式。\n- 上面都是完全客观内容，没有一丝主观的偏向。下面会加入主观评价。\n- 上面都是完全客观内容，没有一丝主观的偏向。下面会加入主观评价。\n- 上面都是完全客观内容，没有一丝主观的偏向。下面会加入主观评价。\n----\n上面还不算单踏板的完全态，那什么才是呢？\n答：认为单踏板模式是更先进的驾驶方式，才是完全态。\n因为这句话的另一个意思是：双踏板是落后的驾驶方式。\n- 进入这个状态后，会坚持避免使用另一个踏板，长期不踩刹车踏板，长达数月。\n- 进入这个状态后，会坚持避免使用另一个踏板，长期不踩刹车踏板，长达数月。\n- 进入这个状态后，会坚持避免使用另一个踏板，长期不踩刹车踏板，长达数月。\n这才叫完整的单踏板完全态。\n这个是我的主观评价，但并非空穴来风，在很多特斯拉车友群和论坛社区，你观察一下就知道\n几个月不踩刹车的人，大有人在，如果你提醒他注意安全，会被批判双踏板是落后的驾驶方式。\n理由是：\n- 两个踏板来回切换，更不安全。\n- 两个踏板来回切换，更不安全。\n- 两个踏板来回切换，更不安全。\n---\n最后是我个人的评价：\n没出事，都好说，出了事，一定会说：\n- 我踩的是刹车踏板，但是刹车失灵了。\n- 我踩的是刹车踏板，但是刹车失灵了。\n- 我踩的是刹车踏板，但是刹车失灵了。\n---\n以上，没有从老司机的角度去批判，全部是真实情况，给大伙做参考。",

          "description": "前几个月新入职一家公司，由于自己对业务不是很熟，而公司又有很多以前的垃圾代码，没有注释没有文档。\n直属领导 A 前几天，给我安排一个需求，需要对原来的代码进行改动。A 在其中一直在指导我怎么怎么做，在大方向上都跟我说好了，我按照他的意思写了文档，补充了一些细节（公司要求先输出技术方案，评审通过后再进行开发）。\n后来，拉会进行评审，主要是我在讲述，技术总负责人 B 全然否定了这个方案，并且较为严厉，也批评了 A 。\n事情大概就是上面这样子，我说一下我的感受。\n首先，我很不舒服，毕竟第一次做这种评审，发生这样的事情，很担心影响自己的 credit\n其次，感觉心里不平衡，因为我觉得这件事情我只是个执行者，技术方案大体框架基本都是直属领导 A 制定的，我由于对业务不熟悉，加上很多信息差，都只是照做而已。而 B 基本上是否定了所有我写技术方案的基础。很无力。\n最后，自己想法还幼稚了一下，在散会后，我和直属领导 A 讨论了 B 提出的方案之后，我随意地苦笑了一下，说自己被 B 怼，很难受。其实本意是希望 A 能平抚我的心情，结果显然是我天真了。A 没有任何其它表示，只说了句，他也被 B 怼了好几次。\n我自己也尝试思考之后怎么解决这个困境，但说实话感觉真难。\n1. 我不能说这个方案是 A 提出的，也就是不知道怎么甩锅出去\n2. 在 A 跟我提出一些方案的时候，我需要用自己的想法去质疑。但做到这点好难，我现在对业务不熟悉，在不了解全貌的情况下，很难说有自己的想法。比如，A 让我把某处代码 x 修改一下，以便于另外一处代码 y 用，我自然是去想如何修改 x 的问题，但结果 B 开会的时候直接质疑这个 x 为什么要改，y 不用这个不行吗？\n如果是各位大佬身处于我的境地，大家会怎么办，希望大家指点迷津",

          "description": "2023 年 1 月 20 号那天突发奇想：日子过得这么快，能不能写点什么记录下来，能留住一些时光，以后年纪大了也好有个回忆？于是从那一天开始写日记，到今天为止，写了 365 篇记录，大概的字数在 40 万字左右。\n初衷\n读小学的时候爸爸就要求我写日记了，初中时也写过一段时间，高中的时候在寝室里，等外面熄灯了，我躲在被子里，左手拿着手电筒和撑着被子，右手就在那写。不过都有一个共同点，都没有坚持下来，断断续续的写了一段时间就停了，等再次捡起来时已经过去了好几年。\n最近想做一个 365 计划，就从写日记开始，坚持写 365 天？一方面圆了小时候的一个愿望，做一件想做但是很久没做的事，又能实现计划的第一步。于是乎，就从这天开始了，我就开始写了。\n坚持\n有人会说从去年 1 月 20 号到今天 3 月 30 号，已经过了 14 个月 10 天，435 天，怎么你才写 365 篇呢，你不是一天写一篇吗？去年有段时间我没有写，或者哪一天太忙了我也没写。对于强迫症来说，这个是不是不完美了，日记没有坚持天天写是失败的？以前我还真是这么想的，现在我的想法是作为一个打工族，每天除了忙于工作，也有很多其他的事要处理，怎么可能坚持每天都写？但如果能尽我所能，尽量每天都写，保持总体的目标是 365 篇，而且尽可能用比较短的时间，而不是用十年，二十年去完成这个不是特别困难的目标，那为什么要计较一天两天没写呢？抱着这样的想法，直到今天终于完成了属于我的小目标。\n同时围绕着这个小目标，我尽力把每一天的事做好，平时让我写 1 万字，我都有点发怵，但是日积月累下来，没想到有这么多。我有个朋友跟我说，你这字数都可以去出书了，确实，一般的书大部分都是在 20 万，40 万左右的，我说还不行，我这废话太多了，属于废话文学。\n内容\n平均每天写了 1000 多字，有那么多写的吗？刚开始写，觉得一切很新奇，也有很多话可以对自己说，但是写一段时间就会腻或者从一开始就没什么写的。\n但我觉得，既然已经决定开始写日记了，那么最重要的是把它当成你的朋友，敞开心扉，有什么事都可以对它说，你白天的工作，你伤心的事，难过的事，开心的事，后悔的事，即将完成的事，想要去做的事，你心中的善念，或者你心中的恶，即使是流水账，都可以说出来，这样内容就会多很多。\n写日记的工具\n最开始我是用有道云笔记写的，但从去年 4 月份开始接触 obsidian 后，便逐渐所有的内容全都转到了这上面来。因为格式是通用的，markdown 形式，就算不用这个软件，也可以很轻松的换到 typora 或者其他，而像 onenote 或者有道，都是独家的格式，很麻烦。第二个是这个文件保存在本地，没有存在云上面，打开很快，而且没有隐私困扰。我自己一直放在本地或者放在我信任的云服务或者 nas 上。\n时间和地点\n最开始的时候我一直用 mac 写，有时候很忙，很难抽得出时间坐在写字桌上，就用手机写。手机最大的好处就是随时随地，方便了，我曾经在火车上写过，在等人的时候写过，在路边写过，在咖啡厅里写过，甚至在旅游途中也在写。用《那些年》的一句台词就是我就是在不停的战斗。最近我换了一下云存储，改用 onedrive 了，所以写作的主力变成了家里的台式机。大屏加上机械键盘，写起来就是更方便，更给力，缺点就是只能在家里这么用了。\n刚开始那段时间早上开始写，我通常第二天写前一天的事，有点像回忆录，优点是能够清楚的了解所有发生的事，不会发生诸如中午把日记写完，结果下午或者晚上有了更加值得的事去记录。白天和晚上都有写过，区别是白天心态更加平和，写起来更加客观，能够奋笔疾书，晚上的话人比较感性，思绪万千，容易不在状态。\n有什么用\n写那么多字或者坚持这么多天，有什么用？借用《让子弹飞》里的一句话，正经人谁写日记啊，用这么多时间还不如去打把王者。\n写这个有什么用呢？我也不知道有什么用，喜欢打游戏有什么用？能拿冠军吗？喜欢打篮球有什么用？能进 NBA 吗？大部分人都是普通人吧，应该很难达到上述的目标，但是做不到这些就不会去打游戏了吗，不会去打篮球了吗？\n人生有什么意义？我也不知道有什么意义，可能有一小部分时间属于我们自己，可以做一些自己想做的事情的时候，就很有意义了。每天打工，每天加班，并不是我们想要的生活。\n话说回来，写日记有什么用呢？我感觉最直观的用途就是如果突然提起去过哪里，我能很快通过日记找出那天，重温一下那天的记忆，有点像录像回放，最直观的功能了。",

          "description": "效率工具 RunFlow 完全手册之进阶篇\n欢迎来到 RunFlow 手册的进阶篇，如果您还不了解 RunFlow ，建议先阅读我们的基础篇。\n搜索文件\n按文件大小过滤，添加 len 参数，比如：len:1kb-2kb，len:3mb-5mb 等等。\n\n** 可以匹配多级目录，比如您想查找文件夹 folder_a 里面以 test 开头的文件，可以这样输入：folder_a/**/test。\n计算器\n我们内置了两个无理数 e 和 pi（圆周率π)。 \n\n计算超大数，如果您想计算 9999999999999999999*9999999999999999999，直接这样输入是没有结果的，我们需要在数字后面添加一个 d 参数，像这样：9999999999999999999d*9999999999999999999d。\n\n解散文件夹\n假设我们有下方示例的一个文件夹，现在我们需要删除文件夹，把所有文件提到同一级，我们就可以使用 folderunwrap。\n文件夹\n├─文本文件_01.txt\n├─文本文件_02.txt\n├─文件夹 01\n│ ├─文本文件_03.txt\n│ └─文本文件_04.txt\n└─文件夹 02\n  └─文件夹 03\n    ├─文本文件_05.txt\n    └─文本文件_06.txt\n\n解散文件夹后都在同一个目录级别：\n文本文件_01.txt\n文本文件_02.txt\n文本文件_03.txt\n文本文件_04.txt\n文本文件_05.txt\n文本文件_06.txt\n\n\n独立窗口运行\n\n导入导出数据\n我们支持导出 JSON 格式的数据，同样导入数据也需要是 JSON 格式的。\n数据同步\n本地同步服务\n基于本地的同步服务是我们内置的功能，它依赖于第三方的云盘服务，比如 OneDrive 、iCloud 、Google Drive 、小米云盘、百度云盘、阿里云盘等等。\n这里我以我常用的 OneDrive 作为示例，其他云盘的同步方法也都一样，我们可以先在 OneDrive 中新建一个 MyFlow 的文件夹用来存储需要同步的数据，然后打开 RunFlow 数据同步的设置页面，开启 基于本地的数据同步服务，并设置数据所在文件夹即可。\n\n偷偷告诉你，开启数据同步服务可以同步剪贴板。\n定时任务\n在热点事件的设置页面中，我们可以通过 Cron 表达式来设置定时任务，比如定时清理电脑垃圾回收站、定期重建文件索引等等。\n\n这里简单解释一下上面的 Cron 表达式：\n秒(0-59)\n分(0-59)\n时(0-23)\n天(1-31)\n月份(1-12)\n星期(0-7, 0 和 7 都是星期天)\n说明\n\n\n\n\n0\n0\n12\n*\n*\n*\n每天中午的 12 点执行\n\n\n0\n0\n12\n*\n*\n1\n每周一的中午 12 点执行\n\n\n\n\n了解等多 Cron 表达式，可以点击这里。\n结语\n本工具内置常见的进阶功能就介绍到这里了，如果您还想了解更多功能，可以到我们的插件商店看看，如果您是一名开发者，欢迎阅读我们的开发者篇手册，也欢迎您来提交插件。",

          "description": "2024 年，有多部值得推荐的爱情主题电影，吸引了广大观众的关注。以下是一些备受期待的爱情电影：\n《一天》(One Day)：这部电影改编自 David Nicholls 的同名畅销小说，讲述了 Emma Morley 和 Dexter Mayhew 两个人的故事。从 1988 年 7 月 15 日开始，两人的关系经历了多年的变化，这部剧情、喜剧和爱情相结合的电影，由利奥·伍德尔、安比卡·茂德、埃茜·戴维斯、蒂姆·普雷斯顿和安珀·格拉比等主演，首播日期为 2024 年 2 月 8 日。\n《可能還愛你》：由《菜鳥新移民》的納娜奇卡可汗执导，这部电影讲述了莎夏和馬可仕这对青梅竹馬的故事。他们从小到大所有人都以为他们会在一起，但他们友达以上恋人未满的感情却遲遲没有进一步发展。15 年后，当莎夏与未婚夫分手，她重新与马可仕相遇，展开了一段新的故事。\n《紫心愛戀》：这部电影讲述了樂團主唱凱西和軍人路克的故事。凯西因为糖尿病而陷入经济困境，偶然遇见同样缺钱的路克，两人决定假结婚以换取保险金。原本陌生的两颗心越走越近，但路克却得远赴伊拉克打仗，面对远距离的思念和对路克安危的担忧，凯西创作了感人至深的歌曲《 Come Back Home 》。\n《心動隔扇窗》：被称为“西班牙版格雷”的浪漫电影，讲述了女主角蕾凱兒暗恋邻居男孩很久，总是偷偷地看着他，从未与他说过话。当男孩开始回应她的感情时，两人之间的关系开始发生变化，电影中不少火辣场面，保证让情人节的夜晚更加火辣。\n这些电影不仅涵盖了从纯爱到情欲的不同类型，还展现了爱情的多样性和复杂性，无论是寻找浪漫的爱情故事，还是想要体验心动的情感冒险，Netflix 在 2024 年都为观众提供了丰富的选择。",

          "description": "近些年随着大聪明领导的增加，像咱们这些憨厚老实，任劳任怨的员工，甲状腺结节越发的普及。\n那今天就跟大家说一下，有了甲状腺结节，该怎么样买保险。\n首先在各家保险公司的重疾险赔付数据中，癌症几乎占到了 7 成以上，而甲状腺癌又占到了其中的 3 成，所以各家保险公司对甲状腺结节的核保会比较注意，下边我会针对甲状腺结节的几种情况，来说一下分别会有什么样的核保结论。\n一、有分级的情况\n首先甲状腺结节是有分级的，分为 0-6 级，级别越高恶性的概率越大。\n如果分级是 0 级，是需要进一步复查的。\n1-2 级，重疾险是有可以标体承保的产品的，也就是不用额外交保费，并且之后万一得了甲状腺癌也可以正常理赔的。\n到了 3 级，大部分重疾险都会除责承保了，也就是不会赔付甲状腺相关的重疾了，但是其他的重疾还是可以赔的。\n1-3 级的甲状腺结节，医疗险一般都是除责承保。\n到了 4 级及以上，绝大部分重疾险和医疗险都会拒保了，如果分级是 4a 的情况下，可以尝试去投保，有极个别的重疾险可以除责承保的。\n二、没有分级\n没有分级就需要针对具体情况看了，比如边缘是否清晰，是否是单发，是否有血流信号等，需要一体况一分析了。\n三、进行了手术\n如果对甲状腺结节进行了手术，术后病理是良性的，重疾险和医疗险都是有机会标体承保的。\n如果手术后病理是恶性的，就要根据情况进行核保了，一般术后最少需要半年-1 年再进行复查，结果比较理想的情况下，重疾险也是有机会除责承保的。\n关于我，一名保险经纪人。\n之前从事 10 年 QA ，目前转行保险经纪人 3 年，保险经纪人和保险代理人最大的区别就是，保险经纪人会和很多保险公司合作，市面上 90%的产品都有，会根据委托人需求再选择产品，附上 V2EX 不定期更新的保险科普帖： https://www.v2ex.com/t/981804\n同时我在全网多平台更新视频及文章，欢迎关注： 王瑞说保险 / 王瑞说保\n也帮了不少 V 友进行了保险解答或保险规划，有想了解或者需要帮助的，可以加 V：WSJianBao 备注 V2",

          "description": "大家好，我是 animalgenerator.co 的开发者，一个只了解 html+css 会一点点 javascript 的小白\n首先，我想分享一下我创建这个工具站的初衷。\n因为之前经历过 1 次裁员，为了在空余时间学点东西，或许还能赚点钱。\n我找到了一个项目想走完一套流程从开发到推广，凭我有限的编程知识，觉得这个生成随机动物图片的需求应该算比较简单吧！\n只需要做 2 个按钮，1 个点击可以随机生成，1 个可以分享就行了。\n我遇到了 2 个问题，还有想到的 2 个问题不知道怎么解决\n1 、html 的页面自己写的很难看，因为搞不懂 css 里面的 div ，后来就去 tailspark.co 上找到了一些相对好看的按钮和样式来拼凑这个 index.html 首页\n2 、javascript 写这个随机展示图片的函数，我不会写，就用 kimi.ai 告诉它我的需求，直接给我生成了随机展示 6 张图片的代码\n3 、本来图片下面有行动物名称的，还不会调样式，所以始终展示不出来，还不知道怎么解决\n4 、动物图片有 10 张，我现在是放在图片目录下面的，这样加载就会很慢，但是如果放在数据库里面，我还不知道怎么写，怎么部署后端的数据库和服务呢，更何况应该至少有 200 多张图片，如果都放在图片目录下面，应该会更慢吧\n\n虽然呈现的效果还没有达到预期，不过我也终于鼓起勇气，将我的第 1 个简陋的版本上线了——animalgenerator.co ，一个可以生成各种动物图片的网站，这些图片展示了各种动物，或许对认识生物多样性有用。\n未来的目标也是做 1 个独立开发者，感觉真是太酷啦\n我深知，作为一个个人开发者，要做出一款受欢迎的工具并不容易。在这个过程中，肯定会遇到很多很多的问题\n，但是作为小白，从 0 分到 60 分的这个过程感到非常的愉快，感觉每学会一点都有很多乐趣，也许这就是程序员编程的快乐吧！虽然我还算不上程序员\n我想通过这个帖子，向 V2EX 的各位朋友展示我的小小成果，也希望能够听到大家的意见和建议。如果你对我的网站有任何想法，或者在使用过程中遇到任何问题，都欢迎随时和我联系。\n谢谢大家的耐心阅读，期待与你们的交流！",

          "description": "各位 V 友晚上好，希望大家能够给我一些建议，非常感谢，先简单说一下我目前的情况：\n坐标：深圳，Java 开发\n事件时间线如下：\n3 月中旬：入职 A 公司，因为各种原因，不太想干了，然后去面试了下面的 B 公司\n3 月 29 号：去 B 公司面试（某珠宝公司）\n3 月 30 号：\n上午 9 点收到 B 公司 HR 电话，告知面试通过，并且添加了我的微信，把入职需要准备的资料、试用期薪资、转正薪资以聊天文字的形式发给了我，并约定好周二（ 4 月 2 号）将入职资料送到公司，周三（ 4 月 3 号）直接去上班。（我有要求 HR 以邮件的方式给我发送 offer ，她给我说的是微信发也一样）\n上午 10 点，我向原公司（ A 公司）提出辞职申请，和 HR 和上级都沟通了，发起了钉钉辞职流程。\n4 月 1 号：交接完工作，签署离职相关文件，拿到离职证明。\n4 月 2 号（今天）：去 B 公司工厂（ HR 在工厂）送入职资料，到了之后人不在，给她打电话说去展厅了，找了一个男的和我沟通，说因为 HR 最近处理的简历比较多，通知错人了，让我谅解一下（来回路费他给我报销），我顿时一脸懵逼，看不起谁呢。掰扯了好久，我说出了我的诉求，因为 B 公司的原因导致我辞去了现有的工作，我要求他们赔偿我现有公司试用期一个月的工资，对方要我提供劳动合同和辞职证明，回去后我把辞职证明和劳动合同拍照发给了联系我的 HR ，然后她回复我：法务会和我对接。下午 4 点，那个男的打电话联系我，说最多只能赔偿我深圳的基础工资（好像是 2360 元），我果断拒绝了。我最低的要求就是上家公司试用期一个月的工资，现在环境不好，一个月都不一定找得到工作。\n\n我目前想法是能私了就私了，不过目前看起来有点悬，实在不行就准备网上立案诉讼（案由是-缔约过失责任），大家觉得能行吗。",

          "description": "今天我要向你们展示如何在 Shopify 上创建你的第一个产品。\n如果你刚刚注册并且对 Shopify 完全陌生，这个教程适合你。我会一步一步引导你完成第一个产品设置。\n如果你还没有注册，你可以点击这里。\n在注册完成后，根据以下步骤:\n登录进店铺后台\n点击这里的“Product” 在左手边的侧边栏\n\n右上角点击\"Add product\"\n。\n准备\n产品图片\n产品描述\n产品视频(如果有)\n添加产品信息\n添加的是你的标题。我要卖一个手提包，所以我的标题是 CARRYALL TOTE BAG 。在创建标题时你需要注意的一点是相关的关键词。我一般使用 sumrush 来找关键字，如果你不熟悉 semrush 呢, 到时我再出一个教程，现在就按照你感觉来。\n编写描述：你在这里选择的风格完全取决于你卖的是什么，当然。但是这里有一些你肯定需要考虑的事情：首先，你的产品使用哪些材料，购买这个商品时包含什么，也许是尺寸或大小，你的产品的好处和用途是什么，它有什么优点，也许是库存和运输信息，当然，你还需要包括你的独特卖点，这就是我们在营销中称为 USB 的东西，这意味着什么使你的产品或服务比竞争对手更好。所以要确保考虑到这一点，并将其包含在你的描述中。同时，确保包括你的品牌声音，看它是否与你品牌的性格和风格一致，并且还要记住考虑任何客户在购买前可能想知道的相关信息。当然你也可以使用视频做为描述\n \n添加产品照片，一定要选择很棒的产品照片，确保它们看起来美观专业。记住，大多数人可能会根据你的照片形成第一印象。\n\n现在你需要设置价格，在设置价格时你应该考虑的一些因素。如果你完全不知道如何开始，我建议你做的第一件事可能是看看你的竞争者，看看他们的价格是多少。除此之外，你还需要考虑你的生产成本，你所销售商品的需求有多高，你的客户愿意花多少钱，诸如此类的事情。\n\n你可以看到我这里对每一个变体设置了价格，当然你可以设置一样或不一样的价格，这完全取决于你\n搜索引擎的 listing 设置定这一步非常重要，因为新客户一般会从搜索引擎找到你售卖的产品。这里你可以使用 AI 来帮助你完成\n\n如果你想立即发布这个产品，你可以在这里找到产品状态，并点击激活。如果你还不确定你是否想要这个产品立即上线，只要点击草稿，什么都不会在你的商店发表。\n\n关联 Collection 就是产品会在哪个集合中显示，这里可以多选的。\n\n最后点击 Save 保存\n那么，这就是你在 Shopify 上创建第一个产品的方法。如果你回到这里，你会看到有一个新产品可用。\n最后\n如果你对如何定制你的店铺外观感兴趣，以及如何展示你的产品，请关注我的系列文章。我会分享一系列实用技巧，帮助你首次为 Shopify 配置店铺，我期待着与你一起探索这个过程。如果你有任何疑问，请在评论区留言，我会尽力为你解答。如果你觉得这篇文章对你有所帮助，请给我点赞，这对我来说意义重大。非常感谢你的阅读，期待在下一篇文章中见到你。",

          "description": "帖子原文： https://v2ex.com/t/1027901\n看评论，大家都一边倒的在骂小孩。如果我没养过娃或者接触的少，我可能也会一边倒的批判小孩子。但经历了多了我会有不同的看法。结合自己育娃的一些经验，提供一些不同角度的看法。先说下我的结论吧：\n这个小孩子患有某种精神疾病，具体什么疾病这个涉及的比较多，我无法给出结论。我这么猜测的原因如下\n1 、帖子里说了小孩子 1 米左右，那就是在 3 岁左右，这个年龄段的小孩子其实非常胆小，基本没有敢主动攻击大人的，养过娃的应该有体会，这个年龄段的小孩子一般都怂的要死。\n2 、“大人也没有向我道歉，还一直跟小孩说幸好我脾气好，不然 blabla 的”，这句话潜在含义这不是小孩子第一次这么做了，之前应该被其他人还批评教训过。但同时另一位大人让他道歉，只是不听。说明这家人不是那种完全不讲理的，只不过可能经历得多了，处理得并不好。\n3 、原文有这么一句话“但这小孩根本不听，依然对我怒目而视”，这是我特别深有感触的一点。因为我接触过几乎和这一模一样的小孩子。差不多也是这个年纪，我的娃第一次和他玩，玩着玩着的过程中，突然要打我娃，眼睛瞪得特别吓人，把我娃也吓到了。当时我也很愤怒，好在旁边有人，制止了他进一步的行为。后续才知道，这个小孩子有精神类疾病（大多数时候没问题，但如果遇到什么情况就会大人），小孩一家也很可怜，妈妈只能辞去工作，去学校陪读。了解到这个背景后，我也没那么气了，因为小孩子很多疾病真的没办法，哪家撞上都是倒大霉。\n这里只是结合自己的经历，提供一些自己的看法，我个人非常痛恨那些熊孩子，特别是最近的热点话题，恨的直痒痒。只不过因为这个帖子比较特殊，娃实在是很小（三岁左右，如果是六岁以上我可能就不会这么结论了），我并不认为他是真的很坏那种，刚好自己也有类似的经历，所以拿出来和大家分享。无意给那小孩洗地。\n不过这个家长确实做的有不到位的情况，这时候应该主动和对方道歉（甚至在肢体动作上，给对方暗示下小孩子有问题)。养娃的也可以分享下自己的看法。",

          "description": "我的博客原文： https://blog.licsber.site/2024/03/29/人月神话的困境/\n很多“聪明人”的思维都是线性思维，拿到任务，分解成小项，逐个完成，一步一步的像是在做证明题：期待着攒够一个又一个的事实和推理，最后拼图一般将它们串起来，达成某项任务。逻辑层面上看起来无懈可击，仿佛一切困难都可迎刃而解。\n不可否认的是这套思维在应试方面屡试不爽，因为有一个天然的假设是存在的：“所有问题都有标准答案，问题在设计上就是逻辑可解的”。但是习惯这套“逻辑“的人，在处理现实世界的问题时，往往会不自觉地将自己带入死胡同。\n我将这个方法论称之为逻辑关联，与之相对的即是事实关联，生活中不乏遇到这种思维陷阱：\n白菜 3 块钱一斤，15 块钱可以买五斤白菜\n你们工厂一个月可以生产 3000 个零件，那明天先给我 10 个吧\n这个项目比较急，上次排期的工时是一周，我再给你一倍的人，三天给我做出来\n有时候其实很难意识到这样的思考模式存在的问题，这也是《人月神话》里屡次提到的困境，可能上面的例子不太直观，代入下现实生活：\n生一个孩子需要 9 个月，生一对双胞胎需要 18 个月\n生一个孩子需要 9 个月，9 个妈妈是不是只要 1 个月？！\n专注解决问题的思维方式久了，就会慢慢开始只在乎逻辑关联，而忽略事实关联，就会开始期待一种“银弹”，说是缘木求鱼也不过如此。\n很多初级项目经理最常犯的错误就在这里，总是期待着任何事情都有一个进度条，这样就可以直观的反馈当前进展，自己要做的也就不过是按照排期表往下催进度。\n这种人最喜欢问的问题就是“你这个要多久才能做出来？”，行使着身为“管理者”的特权，却不承担应有的角色义务。\n项目经理这个角色，真正应该问的问题是“你还需要哪些其他的帮助可以提升你的速度？”。优秀的项目经理知道，项目进度不是靠完成了多少来判断，而是靠如何拥有足够的资源进行最大规模的试错。项目经理确保的应该是满足需求，成功交付，然而现实中 X-Y 本末倒置的现象非常普遍，即为了完成某个目标，制定了一些 KPI （关键绩效指标），最后完全忽视了原初的目标，而去追求后定的 KPI 。就像是前段时间北京环卫工人买新鲜白菜当厨余垃圾事件，政策目标是垃圾分类，管理者制定了每种垃圾必须的数量指标，然后只考察这个数量指标，下面执行的人就变了味，偏离初衷，最终酿成悲剧。\n再者，项目经理在向上汇报进度的同时，也在享受作为一个管理者的荣誉，以及成功后收割胜利果实。这使得执行层面的人本身就对这些只能汇报进度，却无法承担执行工作的人非常敌视。\n况且在软件开发这个对人依赖非常大的领域，管理起来更需要一定的水平积累。项目经理每天跟人打交道，要知道人是有感情的，绝对不是你给他输入 1+1 ，他就给你输出 2 。同一个功能点同一个人，由于其工作状态的差别，也会产生巨大的差异，如果主动积极做，可能只要 1 天，消极怠工的做，就无法预期了。这在传统行业是无法想象的，因为只要按规定的程序和规范来做，即使换一拨工人，也可以在同样的时间建造出来，建出来的房子的质量也不会相差太远。要知道，再烂的挖土机也能挖出一个大坑。\n执行时，对软件工程师来说，遇到问题，解决问题。但如果遇到的问题占用了比预期更多的时间，则是对自己能力和自信的打击。此时如果项目经理也不专业，硬推进度，工程师就会出现一些掩盖问题的行为。\n我总觉得，负责技术攻坚的人也去追进度就很可惜。悲剧的根源是管理能力和技巧的不足，如果真的想做到结果导向，需要的是目标的制定和拆解，工作计划的精确评估和执行，真实有效的复盘，信息同步与应对突发状况的能力，这些都对领导者有很高的要求，如果能力不足以管理结果，那大家就只能来管理过程，最终陷入恶性循环。\n参考\n工程师想要做管理？先改变你的思考方式\n从程序员到项目经理：为什么要当项目经理",

          "description": "简版：电梯里一小孩误以为我挡住了电梯门，然后就被小孩无脑打了几下且力度不小。\n地铁到站后看到等垂梯的人比较少，于是就准备坐垂梯出站。\n一向不太喜欢跟人挤，所以排最后一个进。进去后站好，门要关的时候又突然开了。\n观察了一下，确认自己并没有挡门，于是撇了眼电梯按钮方向，像是有个小孩在按，以为是按错了就没有在意。\n但是门在第二次关的时候又开了，还伴随着滴滴声。正想要仔细看看是不是真按错了按钮时，突然感觉腰部受到重击，回头一看是那个小孩在打我。\n目测这个小孩身高 1 米左右，举着双手打到我腰部和靠上一点的位置，不是很痛，但是明显感觉力道不小。\n打了几下之后被他家大人拉开了，后面还听到他家其中大人(妈妈？)在跟他解释是自己不小心靠着碰到按钮了。后面又听到另一个大人(爸爸？)用比较严厉的口吻跟他说，就是你(指小孩)自己按的！\n然后就是另一位大人(奶奶？)让他跟我道歉，但这小孩根本不听，依然对我怒目而视，我相信如果不是被拉着，他肯定还要接着打我。\n大人也没有向我道歉，还一直跟小孩说幸好我脾气好，不然 blabla 的。\n第一次遇到这种事还是有点懵逼的，完全不知道该怎么办，电梯上去的过程中还是非常想还下手，但是好几个大人在肯定也不现实，而且也想到什么只要还手就是互殴，到时候整个跟小孩互殴，会不会是我责任更大？最后非常木讷地上去之后正常出站回家了。\n走在回家的路上越想越气，就想着至少也应该报个警帮他们管教一下，但是又一想，这么点事到时会不会被说浪费警力啥的。\n目前还是被打的地方还是有点不适感的，像是那种腰累的感觉。\n仅吐槽，无法感同身受请勿恶语伤害。",

          "description": "先说情况（个人主观叙述）：骑自行车在一个路口右转，该路段仅有一条约 1.5 米宽的人行道（上有盲道、公交车站等设施，顶上有施工的脚架），我在机动车道最右侧行驶，被交警截停，以违反《中华人民共和国道路交通安全法》第五十七条规定为由，根据《中华人民共和国道路交通安全法》和《广东省道路交通安全条例》作出警告处罚。执法过程中我向执勤交警指出，在没有划定非机动车道的情况下，非机动车可以在机动车道最右侧行驶。执勤交警说在全国范围内，人行道均可以兼当非机动车道。当时赶着骑行，也不想为难交警（因为没罚款），就签名拿了罚单。\n回来之后越想越不对，查阅了相关条款，罗列如下：\n《中华人民共和国道路交通安全法》第三十六条：根据道路条件和通行需要，道路划分为机动车道、非机动车道和人行道的，机动车、非机动车、行人实行分道通行。没有划分机动车道、非机动车道和人行道的，机动车在道路中间通行，非机动车和行人在道路两侧通行。\n《中华人民共和国道路交通安全法》第五十七条：驾驶非机动车在道路上行驶应当遵守有关交通安全的规定。非机动车应当在非机动车道内行驶；在没有非机动车道的道路上，应当靠车行道的右侧行驶。\n《中华人民共和国道路交通安全法实施条例》第七十条：因非机动车道被占用无法在本车道内行驶的非机动车，可以在受阻的路段借用相邻的机动车道行驶，并在驶过被占用路段后迅速驶回非机动车道。机动车遇此情况应当减速让行。\n我觉得主要争议点如下：\n“非机动车未在非机动车道内行驶”：他的表述看起来没有问题，确实没在非机动车道行驶。但现场并无非机动车道，按规定可以在车行道右侧行驶，应该不适用于这条。\n“人行道可以兼当非机动车道”：同样按照《中华人民共和国道路交通安全法》第五十七条，非机动车也不应该在人行道行驶，交警这句话本身就是错的。另外，如果要按照这条执法，非机动车在机动车道行驶可能违法，在人行道行驶也可能违法，非机动车到底怎么开？\n另，这种情况是否可以向交警提起异议，撤销处罚？",

          "description": "2024 ，第 12 周，0318-0324\n如释重负的一周，放松了很多。\n\n极简日记 iOS\n这周终于提交了一个 TF ，主要是围绕导出导出功能做优化：\n修复了导出闪退\n导出时可以看到图片总数\n点击数据文件可以直接打开 App 进行导入\n直接将导出的数据文件直接放到 App 的文件夹内，并可以一键打开文件夹\n内存释放问题\n从上周开始，我就一直在处理导出数据时爆内存的问题。数据比较少的时候还好，但是数据一多，特别是图片内容比较多的情况下，导出时必然会出现因为内存不足而闪退。\n经过逐项方法的排查，最终确定问题就出现在读取图片数据上。我尝试了各种方法，减少 fetch limit ，加 autoreleasepool ，每次循环结束后清空数组，都不行。而且奇怪的是，即使退出导出页面了，被占用的内存也没有释放。\n后来在请教了肘子哥之后，肘子哥立刻看出了问题所在，一针见血，一句代码就解决了我的问题。原来我之前使用的是全局的 Environment 托管上下文，改成临时的上下文就 ok 了。\n这不是第一次肘子哥帮我解决 Core Data 方面的问题了，在此，赞美肘子哥！\nDebug view\n为了让用户帮我调试 App ，我写了个在非生产环境下才会出现的 debug view 。 正好 RevenueCat 也有一个 debug UI ，可以显示关于内购的相关信息，就也加进来了。Debug mode 下没有任何问题，但是 Release Mode 就无法编译，archive 也不行，找了半天原因，直到看到 RevenueCat 的文档里有这么一句：\nNote: The debug UI won't compile for release builds, so you'll need to disable the behavior before archiving for release.\n旁路由\n买了大电视后，就特别想在电视上看 Netflix 。\n最简单的方案应该是 Apple TV ，但是没舍得。前些天差点就买了一个软路由，但是看看价格还是舍不得。之前用 NAS 折腾过一次旁路由，失败了。又看了几个教程后发现我的 NAS 完全可以做旁路由，之前失败其实是搞错了方向。\n周日花了一下午和一晚上终于搞定了 Nas+OpenWrt 。期间遇到了 OpenWrt 可以联网，但是连到 openwrt 的手机无法联网的问题。装了两个不同版本的 openwrt 的镜像，各种瞎鼓捣，又是 opkg ，又是配置接口和防火墙，还特意花钱注册了一个论坛账号。\n搞定后发现，将电视的 IP 和 DNS 设置成旁路由还是比较麻烦，还不如直接用电脑或者手机投屏了……不过 OpenWrt 还是有很多可玩性的，有待以后慢慢探索了。\n认真减肥第三周\n本周体重变化不大，但是有新突破，突破了 190 斤，最低 189.7 斤。\n有两天的晚饭吃得比较晚，因为特别饿吃得还比较多，万幸没有涨称。\n健身+游泳\n这周只去了两次健身房，周二练背，周五练胸。\n泳池终于重新开放了，去年买的游泳三件套终于开封了，去游了 30 分钟。\n不服不行，年龄越大，身体恢复就越慢，健身后三天酸痛都没有丝毫减轻。\n杂事\n周五的时候清空了 Boss 给的任务列表，度过了一个轻松无压力的周末\n买了个 69.8 的联想夹耳式耳机，真是一分钱一分货啊，包装和做工都非常差，到手后试听了 1 小时果断退货了\n花了一下午折腾在本地用 act 执行 GitHub action ，失败\n继续上周的 SwiftData 学习，这周看完了 Stewart Lynch 的这个系列视频\n看完了网飞版的《三体》，没想到我的时间线上对这个剧评价的两极分化如此严重。我看过原著，也看过腾讯版，我个人倒是觉得网飞版还不错，可以打四星\n采用一种新的番茄工作法，写 25 分钟代码，玩一局 Brotato 😜",

          "description": "为什么能不还呢？靠脸皮厚死撑？靠法律在我一边？\n当然不是！更不是熬到 P2P 公司暴雷跑路。在这样一个风口上，在资本大量涌向 P2P 行业的时候，在这样一片前景大好的时候，要作出行业暴雷的判断，要么这个人是绝顶的商业天才，要么他就是这次风口的幕后操盘手。我这位同事，自然是跟这些毫不沾边的。\n主要的原因在于：当时的平台，全都没有活体（人脸）验证技术！\n只要有一个正常的手机（含卡）、一张身份证、一张银行卡，就能走到提交借款申请的流程。那么，如果我用的所有东西都是鲁迅的，你怎么找到我？你找鲁迅跟我有什么关系？\n所以说，人脸识别，在证件链中是一项革命性的技术，它让信息安全在领域里有了质的飞跃。现下的我们回过头去看，发现过去的平台漏洞很大，那是因为技术更迭太快了，我们这种回看，属于站在巨人肩膀上进行俯视。但是，在人脸识别仅存在于大厂开发和内测阶段、并未正式面世的当时，绝大多数人从惯性思维出发，并没觉得这个借款流程或环节有什么不对。\n当然，平台明白用户的证件链是有缺陷的，所以，除了身份证信息这种常规审核外，结合现有技术，平台通常有以下潜在的机制和审核：\n1 、用户注册登录时，需要授权程序读通讯录名单、读相册图片、读通话记录、读摄像头等功能，以便后期给催收提供素材。拒绝权限的设备将无法正常使用 APP ；\n2 、用户手机的通讯录、相册里的数据不能太少，否则人工审核不会通过；\n3 、用户需要填写一名紧急联系人（或称“担保人”）信息，由平台人员电话核实确有其人。\n平台做的这一切，都是为了确保手机前的借款人与其提交的身份信息上的人，是同一个人。\n本来，这些潜在的审核规则，普通用户是不容易发现的，但该同事依靠着特殊的知识获取途径——产品评审会，如卧底般迅速拆解了这些设定，还恰恰有路子把规则避开！虽然期间经历了一点小小的不爽，比如，他与法律同事俩人确定要干这件事后，就联系之前那个卖“套件”的人，想再买一套身份信息，对方开口就是 2000 。他说，上回 1200 呀，咋涨这么多，而且我不需要 U 盾。对方一副爱买不买的态度，说，现在就这个价。双方因此不欢而散。\n我同事又去找其他路子，但忙活了几天，也没发现有卖得比那个人便宜的。他不得不放低姿势，再去找那哥们买货，结果，人家报价 2400 了！他气得要砸键盘。一旁看着的法律同事倒是非常淡定，笑了笑，说：算了，这就是风口嘛，只要东西能用就行，买，买两套，要快。\n于是，加上之前买的那套身份信息，他，以及和他搭档的律师老乡，在网络世界上，有了 3 个影子。",

          "description": "在德国一段时间以后，感觉自己的时间太少，每周 40 个小时的工作时间还是太长。\n和老板商量以后决定从这周起调到 36 个小时，当然工资也会减少 10%。\n目前暂时定每周五下午不上班，以后可以根据情况调整但事先要和团队沟通好。\n这段时间用来自我提升也好、多点休息时间也好，都是不错的选择。\n减薪 10%的心理影响还是蛮大的，虽然不差这点钱，但是毕竟也是一笔不大不小的财富。\n不过想到多出来的部分还是要交 42%的税就没那么心疼了。就当前两年涨的薪换成减少工作时间好了。\n由于前几年用力有点过猛感觉生理心理上都开始有一些不适，今年初开始反思自己的工作生活。\n为此我还特别订了一周的“培训假期” Bildungsurlaub ，自费培训但是公司给额外带薪年假。\n还订了一周的“疗养”，同样是带薪假。\n加上每年 32 天的年假，今年的年假总天数有 42 天。\n今年里先用这段时间放松一下，仔细规划一下人生和工作看看要作哪些进一步改变。",

          "description": "我说说自己的情况。在我小学的时候，大家没有手机，没有电脑。能接触到的信息非常有限，所以我经常外出接触其他的小伙伴玩耍，然而人与人之间的快乐就是那么简单，只要见面就肯定会有故事。虽说到了现在也可以。但是我发现大家在一块了之后都拿着手机，几乎很少聊天了。并不是有责怪朋友的意思，其实自己也会。哪怕你的好友在你的微信里面有一长串名单，好像近在眼前，你也不知道说啥。为什么呢？因为好像说的东西我们都在互联网上说了，我看到的东西你肯定也能看到了，所以都没有什么新鲜感。但在我小时候不一样。如果某人从某个地方回来，立马就可以进村情报中心唠嗑。或者哪怕在附近接上走上一圈，也能碰到不少熟人打招呼，或许就能聊上大半天。你可能说这没什么。但是你忽略一点，网络上聊天大部分是文字语音，很少视频。就是算是视频，也难比得上见面聊。毕竟见面聊天，能观测到的维度要多得多，当然乐趣也会多很多。说到这里，肯定很多人就说你是不是没朋友啊。我也有，跟大多数人一样，有一大长串。但是我也真的不知道对他们说什么，有时候我真的很想打电话给他们。但是我真的不知道说什么呀！我唯一想去做的就是想去见他们。感觉只要在一起就能有很多快乐。\n\n好了，我们说回正题。为什么会变成这样？我们用图纸来说明。我在上面写上以前，现在，未来。首先我给大家介绍一个事实：“若你回到以前，首先声明不是穿越，只是回到那个以前的自己。你能看到现在的情景吗？或者说预知。看不到吧。同理可证，那回到现在，你是不是也看不到未来吗？是看不到吧。”\n\n我觉得我的问题就出在这儿。以前信息接触的少。我小时候能接到外面的信息都是通过书本或者大人告诉我们，过滤了很多不好的信息。在那时候的课本应该还有一本叫社会的课。我不记得是不是这个名字。我不知道大家有没有，我记得是有一本了。那时候从课本上感知的社会都是很美好的，真的很美好，就是那种很单纯的美好。美好的事情总是让人向往。所以我那时候…",

          "description": "2010s 之前的时候，应该是各种网游盛行的时候。当时喜欢到网吧一起打游戏，比如 CF ，QQ 飞车之类的。当时还有什么 QQ 空间、QQ 秀、开心网。\n2015 年左右几年，移动互联网开始爆发。当时喜欢研究安卓刷机教程、定制各种 APP UI 、桌面插件、手机上玩各种 3D 大型游戏。一切是那么新奇。\n2017 年发布了 iPhoneX ，此后就感觉手机一直在停滞不前，不知道 2024 年的 iPhone15 和 2017 年的 iPhoneX 有什么区别。反正买台 iPhone 之后就是当做一个通讯工具，然后付钱、拍拍照，别的功能都不用。也不喜欢去折腾安卓。而且现在安卓也不好折腾了。\n各种 APP 也没什么新意.\n再比如网络平台。很久之前的知乎还是一些大佬科普的地方。但现在感觉随着人越来越多，变得乌烟瘴气。微博打开看不了一会儿，那些令人震惊的言论，就让人感觉一阵恶心。小红书上面则是各种人设或者炫耀的帖子。打开网易云音乐，那些留言让人忍不住换到没有评论区的 app ，比如 apple music 和 spotify 。各种论坛充斥着大量的冗杂无聊低质量的信息，让人无法像十年前一样津津有味地看一篇网友的发言。\n感觉一切都变得越来越无聊，不知道是人长大了，还是这个世界的变化减速了，还是说有什么别的至关重要的东西改变了？",

          "description": "日前有消息显示，谷歌DeepMind方面发布的Mixture-of-Depths（MoD），改变了以往Transformer架构的计算模式。\n\r\n\r\n据了解，通过动态分配大模型中的FLOPs（运算次数或计算资源），优化不同层次模型深度中的分配，限制给定层的自注意力和MLP计算的token数量，MoD可跳过一些不必要计算，迫使神经网络学会主要关注真正重要的信息， 实现只给需要准确预测的token分配更多计算资源，从而显著提高训练效率和推理速度。\n\r\n\r\n例如，虽然预测下一个句子的内容很难，但预测句子结束的标点符号很简单，如果给两者分配同样的计算资源，那么后者明显会浪费资源、而MoD则可避免这种情况。\n\r\n\r\n据谷歌方面发布的相关测试结果显示，在等效计算量和训练时间上，MoD每次向前传播所需的计算量更小，而且后训练采样过程中步进速度提高50%。\n\r\n\r\n据了解，谷歌研究团队还探讨了MoD和MoE结合的可能性MoDE，而且结果表明而这一结合能提供更好的性能和更快的推理速度。\n\r\n\r\n此外值得一提的是，为解决AI幻觉问题，不久前谷歌DeepMind还与斯坦福大学联合开了一款AI事实核查工具“搜索增强事实评估器”（Search-Augmented Factuality Evaluator，SAFE）。\n\r\n\r\n据了解，SAFE可通过四个步骤对AI聊天机器人生成的回复进行分析、处理和评估，以验证其准确性和真实性。具体而言，SAFE首先会将回复分割成多个单个待核查内容、对上述内容进行修正，然后再与谷歌搜索结果进行比较。随后，SAFE还会检查各个事实与原始问题的相关性。\n\r\n\r\n为评估SAFE性能，谷歌方面的研究人员还创建了包含约16000个事实的数据集LongFact，并在包括Claude、Gemini、GPT、PaLM-2在内的13个大语言模型上测试了这一工具。结果显示，在对100个有争议事实进行的重点分析中，SAFE的判定在进一步审查下正确率达到76% 。与此同时，SAFE还具备显著的经济性优势，即其成本比人工注释便宜20多倍。\n\r\n\r\n稿源：新浪网",

          "description": "当地时间周一(4月1日)，人工智能(AI)公司OpenAI宣布，将允许用户直接使用ChatGPT，而无需注册该项服务，这将让人们更加容易体验人工智能的潜力。\n\r\n\r\nOpenAI表示，它将从周一开始逐步推出这一功能，让185个国家和地区的超1亿用户使用ChatGPT来学习新事物、寻找创意灵感，并获得问题的答案。2022年底，OpenAI正式发布了人工智能聊天机器人ChatGPT，随后在全世界掀起了人工智能狂潮，它可以模仿人类对话，并执行诸如创建长文本摘要、写诗甚至为主题派对生成创意等任务。\n\r\n\r\n据数据分析公司Similarweb称，自2023年5月ChatGPT全球总访问量达到18亿次的峰值以来，这一受欢迎服务的流量增长开始放缓。\n\r\n\r\n这应该也是OpenAI放开限制的原因，随着人工智能技术的发展，现有的互联网信息量可能不足以支撑科技巨头训练更先进的人工智能系统，甚至高质量文本数据的不足可能减缓人工智能技术的发展速度。\n\r\n\r\nOpenAI还表示，它已为无需注册即可访问ChatGPT的用户引入了额外的内容保护措施，例如阻止更广泛范围的类别中的提示和生成。但并未具体说明这些类别。\n\r\n\r\n除了ChatGPT的免费版本(即ChatGPT3.5)，OpenAI还将继续为个人、团队用户和企业提供付费版本。\n\r\n\r\n该公司还声称，它可能会使用用户提供的内容来帮助改进其大语言模型，但用户可以关闭此功能。\n\r\n\r\n虽然之后用户无需注册即可使用ChatGPT，不过，OpenAI还是建议用户注册一个账户。因为创建帐户有很多好处，包括保存和查看聊天记录、共享聊天记录，以及解锁语音对话和自定义说明等附加功能。\n\r\n\r\n与此同时，OpenAI推出了一种新的人工智能工具Voice Engine，通过输入文本和15秒音频样本，Voice Engine便可以生成一个与音频中说话者非常相似的自然语音，而生成的自然语音具有丰富的情感和逼真的声音。\n\r\n\r\n近日，据证券时报援引科技媒体The Information消息，微软和OpenAI正在规划建设一个雄心勃勃的数据中心项目，该项目可能耗资高达1000亿美元，折合人民币约7200亿元。其中包括一台名为“星际门”的人工智能超级计算机，该计算机将配备数百万个专用服务器芯片，旨在为OpenAI的AI技术提供强大动力。\n\r\n\r\n据悉，上述数据中心项目的成本，是目前一些最大数据中心项目的100倍，微软将承担项目的资金投入，展现了其对推动AI技术发展的坚定信心。整个数据中心项目分为五个阶段，目前正处于第三阶段，后两个阶段的重要节点分别为2026年和2028年。\n\r\n\r\n在微软和OpenAI的算力开发第四、第五阶段，都会有一台标志性的超算。其中第四阶段的超级计算机预期将在2026年投入使用，而第五阶段的超级计算机已经有了一个酷炫的代号——星际门（Stargate），微软高层希望最快能够在2028年推出这款超算。这也将是微软未来六年规划建设的一系列超算中规格最高的一个。\n\r\n\r\n另外，据媒体报道，OpenAI的“下一次重大更新”会在明年初推出。在今年初比尔·盖茨对话奥尔特曼的节目中，OpenAI首席执行官明确表示GPT-5的开发正在进行中。此前也有报道称，GPT-5的发布时间会是今年年中，同时OpenAI已经向一些企业用户提供了早期版本的预览。\n\r\n\r\n来源：每日经济新闻综合OpenAI、证券时报",

          "description": "近日，成都市新都区的一份初三语文试卷引发了社会广泛关注。该试卷中出现了一篇被指涉嫌美化侵华日军和侮辱八路军的文章——《杜鹃花落》。3月25日晚，成都市新都区通报称新都区已成立联合调查组进行全面调查，对相关教研员及区教科院院长予以停职。3月26日，河南省安阳市汤阴县教育局发布通告回应，该文作者已被免职。\n\r\n\r\n有资料称，李佳前是河南汤阴县的一所中学的校长，《杜鹃花落》这篇文章是于去年撰写并发表在网上的。这篇小小说以侵华日军的视角展开，主角岗田大佐是侵华日军的一份子，他的儿子本是日本帝国大学高材生，为了看望父亲来到中国，但在赶赴和父亲团聚的途中被八路军劫走，岗田为报仇而率军扫荡，把一股八路军尽数屠戮之后才发现，八路军一直在尽全力保护自己儿子，反而是自己的报复杀死了儿子。\n\r\n\r\n3月26日深夜，胡锡进在微博平台上发表了一篇近千字的长文，这篇文章针对“成都‘毒试卷’”事件发表了他个人的看法。\n\r\n\r\n胡锡进首先表示：他认可网友们对《杜鹃花落》这篇文章以及“成都‘毒试卷’”事件的愤怒，他觉得“这种愤怒是朴素的，（是）有道理的”，“即使（《杜鹃花落》的）作者有探索新写法的用意，（但）他的这种写法也无法被普通读者（所）理解，因而，（会令众多读者感到不舒服）。”他觉得，他无法确定这名作者的真实用意，很难相信那些初三学生能够理解那些意涵。\n\r\n\r\n接下来，胡锡进认为：无论是对那名已被免职校长（指《杜鹃花落》的作者李佳前）的调查以及对“毒试卷”的调查，都要坚持客观性，要听涉事人员的陈述，在当前的社会环境下，《杜鹃花落》的作者李佳前是不会故意去挑衅社会强大的共识的，是不会拿鸡蛋往石头上撞的。基于此，应该允许《杜鹃花落》的作者李佳前以及“成都‘毒试卷’”的当事人进行申辩。\n\r\n\r\n再接下来，胡锡进认为：小说《杜鹃花落》里面的基本情节不但没有侮辱八路军，而且，还有意突出了八路军的英勇，多数人是被…",

          "description": "当地时间3月17日，特斯拉CEO埃隆·马斯克旗下的人工智能初创公司xAI正式宣布开源大模型Grok-1，遵循Apache 2.0协议开放模型权重和架构。官网显示，xAI已经将Grok-1的权重和架构在软件托管平台GitHub上开源。\n\r\n\r\n官网介绍，Grok-1是3140亿参数的混合专家模型，是“迄今为止全球参数量最大的开源大语言模型”。相比之下，公开资料显示，OpenAI GPT-3.5的参数量为1750亿，Grok-1大幅领先。\n\r\n\r\n马斯克此举可谓说到做到。3月11日，马斯克就曾在社交平台表示xAI将开放聊天机器人Grok的源代码，这意味着公众将可免费使用该公司大模型技术背后的代码，Meta的CEO扎克伯格也在社交平台上发表评论表示支持。\n\r\n\r\n在社交媒体上，网友开玩笑称，xAI才是真正的“Openai”。\n\r\n\r\n马斯克向来支持开源技术，在开源的情况下，创造者向用户提供免费使用许可，有时还允许用户修改他们创造的成果。特斯拉已经开放了其汽车部件的源代码，马斯克的社交媒体平台X则公布了一些其用来对内容进行排序的算法。\n\r\n\r\n其实，马斯克与CEO山姆·奥特曼带领下的OpenAI在人工智能军备竞赛中积怨已久。\n\r\n\r\n马斯克曾是OpenAI的早期资助者和联合创始人，由于与奥特曼就AI安全意见不一，2018年马斯克已经离开OpenAI，他也成了OpenAI最高调的批评者之一。\n\r\n\r\n当地时间2月29日，马斯克刚对OpenAI、奥特曼，以及另一位创始人Greg Brockman提起诉讼，称该公司违背了最初对开源、非营利AI的承诺。在诉讼中，马斯克要求OpenAI恢复开源。\n\r\n\r\nOpenAI也马上对此做出回应。据外媒报道，OpenAI在向旧金山法院提交的法庭文件中表示，与马斯克从未就非营利和不公开源代码达成过创始协议，马斯克捏造所谓的创始协议，作为旨在“促进自己的商业利益”的诉讼的基础。\n\r\n\r\nxAI正式宣布开源大模型Grok-1的当天，马斯克还与ChatGPT在X平台上过招称“告诉我们OpenAI到底open（开源）在哪里了”。\n\r\n\r\n而马斯克旗下的xAI从去年7月份刚成立时，就被称作“OpenAI对手”。据悉，xAI的宗旨是“了解宇宙的真实本质”。\n\r\n\r\n去年11月4日， xAI团队发布了首个AI大模型产品Grok。据官网，作为聊天机器人，Grok能够和ChatGPT一样通过联网来获取实时信息，并浏览和使用X（原推特）平台上的信息。“Grok”一词原是科幻小说《异乡异客》中的一个火星术语，指对某事有非常深刻的同理心或直觉、能充分理解的一种状态。不过，官网同时也提醒用户，相较于其他聊天类机器人，Grok的特点是会用幽默反叛的方式来回答一些被其他AI系统拒绝回答的争议性问题。\n\r\n\r\n驱动Grok的引擎是Grok-1，是xAI团队在过去4个月内运用前沿技术开发的大语言模型。\n\r\n\r\n来源：澎湃新闻",

          "description": "一部“完全由AI制作的开创性长篇电影”《我们的终结者2重置版》Our T2 Remake于3月6日在美国洛杉矶举行线下首映。该片由50位AI领域艺术家组成的创作团队完成，翻拍自卡梅隆执导的经典科幻片《终结者2》（1991年），呈现了一个人类对抗ChatGPT统治的世界，探讨当代AI发展的影响。首映后，该片并没有获得很高的关注，口碑有些遇冷。\n\r\n\r\n团队利用Midjourney、Runway、Pika、Kaiber、Eleven Labs、ComfyUi、Adobe等多个AIGC工具进行创作，同时不使用原电影中的任何镜头、对话或音乐，以确保《我们的终结者2重置版》所有内容均为原创。\n\r\n\r\n电影目前还未大规模放映，创作团队已公开第一幕剧情： 2024年4月1日，30亿Discord服务器宕机，控制着机器人的计算机OpenAI实现了通用人工智能（AGI）。OpenAI派出两个聊天机器人穿越回去，想要摧毁人类反抗军首领山姆·奥特曼Sam Altman，在《终结者2》电影中相对应的角色为约翰·康纳John Connor。\n\r\n\r\n虽然打着“首部AI生成长篇电影”的旗号，但《我们的终结者2重置版》目前在社交平台上，暂时没有什么影评发布，参与首映礼的观众给出的反馈中，基本并未谈及电影本身质量如何，甚至美国主流电影网站也基本没有关于该片的任何报道。\n\r\n\r\n从目前放出的预告片等素材来看，影片有很浓的山寨气质，出现了多种不同的画风，有《星球大战》中的尤达大师、《泰迪熊》中的主角泰迪熊“客串”。由AI生成的场景相对粗糙，很多细节经不起推敲，特别是人物的肢体动作及面部表情仍有些不协调，台词与口型明显对不上，机械感很浓。\n\r\n\r\n今年年初，来自四川的博主“AI疯人院”在网络上发布了一部利用AI技术生成的《西游记》动画短片，视频长约近4分钟，以《西游记》原著第一集为蓝本，用AI描绘出了花果山、仙宫、人间城池等场景，其震撼的视觉效果令众多网友惊叹不已，纷纷感慨科技发展的迅猛。\n\r\n\r\n该博主表示，这段视频如果人工制作至少需要半年，而自己在AI的帮助下用时一周就完成了，随着文生视频模型Sora的问世，很多现在遥不可及的事情在未来都可以实现了。由人类讲述的故事无可替代，但AI赋能影视制作正在逐步切实落地，从创意到制作，AI的介入为影视创作带来了更多可能性。\n\r\n\r\n来源：新京报",

While-Else 结构\n在 Python 中， while 循环可以与 else 块配对。当且仅当循环正常完成时，else 块才会执行，这意味着它不会通过 break 语句终止。\n换句话说，如果 while 循环被 break 终止，则 else 块将不会被执行。\nleaders = [\"Elon\", \"Tim\", \"Warren\"]\ni = 0\nwhile i < len(leaders):\n    if leaders[i] == \"Yang\":\n        print(\"Yang is a leader!\")\n        break\n    i += 1\nelse:\n    print(\"Not found Yang!\")\n\n# Not found Yang!\n\n如上面的示例所示， while 循环迭代 leaders 列表，搜索领导者 \"Yang\"。不幸的是，\"Yang\" 并不是该名单中真正的领导者。所以 break 语句没有被执行。因此，else 语句下的代…",
