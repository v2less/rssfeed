          "description": "Hi HN! We're Edward and Sam, the founders of DryMerge (https://drymerge.com), a tool to automate workflows with plain English. For example, a user can say \"When I get an email from a potential customer, add their details to a google sheet and send me a text\", and DryMerge sets that up end-to-end in seconds. Other examples might be “When I finish a Google Meet with a customer, record any issues reported in Linear”, or “Every morning at 9 am, text me a summary of my calendar events for the day”.\nHere’s a video walkthrough: https://youtu.be/S4L3B21vXGY.\nWe initially set out to build a dev tool for API integration, and while building in the integration space, we realized existing workflow automation tools have a few key limitations.

          "description": "Hi HN! We’re Adrien and Kanav. We met at our previous job, where we spent about a third of our lives combating a constant firehose of bugs. In the hope of reducing this pain for others in the future, we’re working on automating debugging.\nWe’re currently working on a platform that ingests logs and then automatically reproduces, root causes and ultimately fixes production bugs as they happen. You can see some of our work on this here - https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39528087\nAs we were building the root-cause phase of our automated debugger, we realized that we developed something that resembled an omniscient debugger. Like an omniscient debugger, it also keeps track of variable assignments over time but, you can interact with it at a higher level than a debugger using natural language. We ended up sticking it in a pytest plugin and have been using it ourselves for development over the past few weeks.\nUsing this pytest plugin, you’re able to reason at a much higher level than conventional debuggers and can ask questions like:\n- Why did function x get hit?\n- Why was variable y set to this value?\n- What changes can I make to this code to make this test pass?\nHere’s a brief demo of this in action: https://www.loom.com/share/94ebe34097a343c39876d7109f2a1428\nTo achieve this, we first instrument the test using sys.settrace (or, on versions of python >3.12, the far better sys.monitoring!) to keep a history of all the functions that were called, along with the calling line numbers. We then re-run the test and use AST parsing to find all the variable assignments and keep track of those changes over time. We also use AST parsing to obtain the source code for these functions. We then neatly format and pass all this context to GPT.\nWe’d love it if you checked the pytest plugin out and we welcome all feedback :) . If you want to chat bugs, our emails are also always open - kanav@leaping.io\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39791301\nPoints: 75\n# Comments: 14",

We provide generative AI tools for musicians, including text-to-sound and infinite sample packs.\nWe (Mark and Justin) started writing music together a few years ago but felt limited in our ability to create anything that we were proud of. Modern music production is highly technical and requires knowledge of sound design, tracking, arrangement, mixing, mastering, and digital signal processing. Even with our technical backgrounds (in AI and cloud computing respectively), we struggled to learn what we needed to know.\nThe emergence of latent diffusion models was a turning point for us just like many others in tech.

          "description": "Hey HN, we've built DaLMatian, a text2sql product that meets the needs of data analysts working with enterprise data. We built this app because as a data analyst at an enterprise I could not find a text2sql product that was (1) actually useful for my day-to-day and (2) easy to set up on my computer. Existing products either fall apart when tested on gnarly enterprise data/queries or require going through a sales/integration process that I wasn't in a position to push for - I just wanted something that I could quickly set up to help make my job easier. Our goal is to make this a reality for any data analyst that feels the same.\nThere are many constraints that make this reality difficult to achieve. The product needs to scale to databases with millions of columns and extract business logic from very complex queries. It also needs to be fast, at least faster than an analyst would take to write the query. On top of all this, an analyst needs to be allowed to use it from a security standpoint. Our app meets all the key requirements of an enterprise data analyst while also being lightweight enough to run locally on a typical laptop.\nHere's how it works. To get started, you simply need to open a file of past queries in our IDE (try it here: https://www.dalmatian.ai/download) and add a file with your database schema (instructions here: https://www.dalmatian.ai/docs#configuration). There is also an option to connect a database to auto pull your schema (no actual data is seen by the LLM). We do not see anything you input since the app is local and the only external connection is with OpenAI. It's just like asking ChatGPT for help with queries, but in a streamlined way.\nIf you'd download our free IDE and try to break it, we'd love to hear what you come up with!\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39781418\nPoints: 24\n# Comments: 7",

Github: https://docs.ragas.io/en/stable/, docs: https://docs.ragas.io/.\nRagas provides you with different sets of metrics and methods like synthetic test data generation to help you evaluate your RAG applications. Ragas started off by scratching our own itch for evaluating our RAG chatbots last year.\nProblems Ragas can solve\n- How do you choose the best components for your RAG, such as the retriever, reranker, and LLM?\n- How do you formulate a test dataset without spending tons of money and time?\nWe believe there needs to be an open-source standard for evaluating and testing LLM applications, and our vision is to build it for the community. We are tackling this challenge by evolving the ideas from the traditional ML lifecycle for LLM applications.\nML Testing Evolved for LLM Applications\nWe built Ragas on the principles of metrics-driven development and aim to develop and innovate techniques inspired by state-of-the-art research to solve the problems in evaluating and testing LLM applications.\nWe don't believe that the problem of evaluating and testing applications can be solved by building a fancy tracing tool; rather, we want to solve the problem from a layer under the stack. For this, we are introducing methods like automated synthetic test data curation, metrics, and feedback utilisation, which are inspired by lessons learned from deploying stochastic models in our careers as ML engineers.\nWhile currently focused on RAG pipelines, our goal is to extend Ragas for testing a wide array of compound systems, including those based on RAGs, agentic workflows, and various transformations.\nTry out Ragas here https://colab.research.google.com/github/shahules786/openai-... in Google Colab.

It supports `position`, `inline-block`, `z-index`, and complex properties like `float` and `vertical-align`. It doesn't support high-level layout like flexbox or grid yet, but you can get intrinsics to easily divide space yourself and paint multiple layout trees. It has a great text layout implementation, and supporting non-Latin scripts is a top priority.\nI've wanted this to exist as far back as 2013, and the desire kept coming up: for a way to get detailed intrinsics, for high quality rich text layout to canvas and SVG, and for server-side rich text. We currently use it in CellEngine for our new canvas-based spreadsheet library to layout text in hundreds of thousands of cells, and will be using it soon to render PDFs with thousands of pages in a few seconds.\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39778570\nPoints: 250\n# Comments: 85",

          "description": "Hi everyone!\nI’m excited to open source GritQL, a Rust CLI for searching and transforming source code.\nGritQL comes from my experiences with conducting large scale refactors and migrations.\nUsually, I would start exploring a codebase with grep. This is easy to start with, but most migrations end up accumulating additional requirements like ensuring the right packages are imported and excluding cases which don’t have a viable migration path.\nEventually, to build a complex migration, I usually ended up having to write a full codemod program with a tool like jscodeshift. This comes with its own problems:\n- Most of the exploratory work has to be abandoned as you figure out how to represent your original regex search as an AST.\n- Reading/writing a codemod requires mentally translating from AST names back to what source code actually looks like.\n- Performance is often an afterthought, so iterating on a large codemod can be painfully slow.\n- Codemod frameworks are language-specific, so if you’re hopping between multiple languages—or trying to migrate a shared API—you have to learn different tools.\nGritQL is an attempt to develop a powerful middle ground:\n- Exploratory analysis is easy: just put a code snippet in backticks and use $metavariables for placeholders.\n- Incrementally add complexity by introducing side conditions with where clauses.\n- Reuse named patterns to avoid rebuilding queries, and use shared patterns from our standard library for common tasks like ensuring modules are imported.\n- Iterate on large codebases quickly: we use Rust for maximum performance\nGritQL has already been used on thousands of repositories for complex migrations[1] but we're excited to collaborate more with the open source community.\n[1] Ex. https://github.com/openai/openai-python/discussions/742\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39770908\nPoints: 57\n# Comments: 16",

          "description": "Hi everybody, today I'm launching version 1.0 of Godspeed, a todo manager built with two priorities in mind: speed and 100% keyboard orientation. Every action in Godspeed can be done from your keyboard and will respond instantly. It's like Superhuman for your todo list.\nGodspeed has everything you expect in a todo manager like shared lists, labels, smart lists, boolean search operators, and cloud sync. If you're already a user of an app like Todoist or OmniFocus you should be able find everything you need in Godspeed.\nI think the most appealing thing to most HN users would be the keyboard orientation. Literally every single action in Godspeed is doable from your keyboard. I'm so serious about this that I built \"hardcore mode\" to completely disable the mouse - this both helps you break the habit of reaching for your mouse, and keeps us honest about 100% hotkey support.\nYou can fully customize the hotkeys, but if you're into Vim or Emacs you'll feel right at home by default.\nWe've got a 2 week free trial with no limitations, and then offer subscription or one-time purchase options.\nThanks for checking out Godspeed, I'd love to hear your feedback!\nhttps://godspeedapp.com/\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39756325\nPoints: 180\n# Comments: 132",

It's kind of like if Airtable/Notion built Salesforce today. https://okapicrm.com\nWhen I was fresh out of college, working for startups, Salesforce was this big mystery to me. It's the perpetual second screen for everyone in sales. They were building this gigantic obelisk downtown. What was this thing? And why did every salesperson I knew seem to live in it all day, and yet hate it so much?\nTurns out Salesforce is basically PhpMyAdmin for salespeople. It's just basically two things:\n1. A really generic database, and a UI for CRUDing your data.\n2. An API and ecosystem of integrations.\nIn other words, it's the back-office CRUD app to end all back-office CRUD apps.

Fast forward to today and there are countless alternatives available backed by incredible compute resources, yet we somehow still find ourselves paying the price of long development cycles. That's why I've been working for over a decade to simplify the development stack so we can spend more time on making 1's and 0's do magical things, and why my co-founder Michael and I started Flox …",

          "description": "Hello HN! Pierre and Paul here. We are building an open source text analytics tool for user inputs and LLM app outputs The repo is https://github.com/phospho-app/phospho and landing is https://phospho.ai\nMost people building with LLMs today don’t have quantified evaluation and usage metrics on the interactions between users and their product. The only solution is to read every message (or a sample) to get a sense of what is going on. You can't improve your product without understanding who your users are and how they are using it. Nobody would launch a website without standard analytics today; the same principle should apply to LLM products.\nWe made phospho to analyze the large amounts of text from user inputs and LLM app outputs, and give you quantified and actionable insights.\nYou first log messages and set up semantic events. Eg: “user is talking about sports”, “assistant didn’t quote the source”. We then run asynchronous jobs to detect if events are present in the text or not. To do so, we use GPT-4 for the first few events, and then downsize to smaller fine-tuned models (cheaper & faster). It works with any LLM provider (OpenAI, Mistral, Ollama…). No proxy, no monkey patch, and no OpenAI key needed.\nYou can link phospho to your users’ feedback, and even use the platform to annotate some messages yourself. This helps you design step by step a custom evaluation pipeline that runs automatically, fits your needs, and enables you to iterate.\nResults are available in dashboards, as dataframes, or via API. You can also directly leverage the events in your app to trigger actions in real-time with the API or via webhooks.\nDeploy everything with Docker, or use the hosted cloud version. We have Python/Javascript SDK and an API. License is Apache 2.0.\nGive it a spin and see where we’re at: https://github.com/phospho-app/phospho We’re interested in both feature requests and roasts. Let us know what you think!\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39692249\nPoints: 33\n# Comments: 4",

          "description": "Hi everyone! We're building an AI-enabled editor (https://glide.agenticlabs.com) that helps developers write technical design docs faster. It’s like an IDE with Copilot, but instead of directly editing your code, it helps you come up with a solid plan before implementing a change. There’s a basic demo here (https://youtu.be/5uEapdT6nYE), and we also recorded a session with one of our early users running through an unusual task (calling a Fortran algorithm from Go, https://youtu.be/ppluB0Z1OIA)\nWhy use design docs?

          "description": "I am really puzzled by TPUs. I've been reading everywhere that TPUs are powerful and a great alternative to NVIDIA.\nI have been playing with TPUs for a couple of months now, and to be honest I don't understand how can people use them in production for inference:\n- almost no resources online showing how to run modern generative models like Mistral, Yi 34B, etc. on TPUs\n- poor compatibility between JAX and Pytorch\n- very hard to understand the memory consumption of the TPU chips (no nvidia-smi equivalent)\n- rotating IP addresses on TPU VMs\n- almost impossible to get my hands on a TPU v5\nIs it only me? Or did I miss something?\nI totally understand that TPUs can be useful for training though.\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39670121\nPoints: 68\n# Comments: 28",

          "description": "Tasks are a primitive for asynchronous programming and an alternative to working with threads directly. Instead of creating a thread, performing work, then waiting on it using synchronization primitives, you only define a unit of work and let a scheduler decide when and where to execute it. The threads that the scheduler uses are created once and reused for many tasks throughout the program's lifetime. In most cases, creating and executing a task requires not even a single syscall and is a significantly faster operation than creating a thread, resulting in lower latency. Furthermore, tasks from different subsystems can be automatically interleaved by the scheduler, which is difficult to achieve manually with threads without communication between the subsystems.\nThe library is written in standard C11 and only depends on the C POSIX library. It is designed to be easy to integrate into a project by just copying the header and simple enough to be understood in an afternoon.\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39667489\nPoints: 69\n# Comments: 21",

          "description": "Hello Hacker News! My name is Anonyo, and I am a seventeen-year-old from Southeast Michigan. This is wallstreetlocal, my passion project for the last year (and a half). I've posted this before, but I've finally open-sourced this entire project, so I thought I'd post it again.\nHeres the short pitch.\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) keeps record of every company in the United States. Companies whose holdings surpass $100 million though, are required to file a special type of form: the 13F form. This form, filed quarterly, discloses the filer's holdings, providing transparency into their investment activities and allowing the public and other market participants to monitor them.\nThe problem though, is that these holdings are often cumbersome to access, and valuable analysis is often hidden behind a paywall. Through wallstreetlocal, the SEC's 13F filers become more accessible and open.\nBy exploring the website (and the code), you can see the resources I used, check out some notable money managers I listed, and download any data that suits you. All for free. (Note, the mobile site likely needs work.)\nI made this project to better democratize SEC filings, and also to get some experience on my hands. I love computers, and one day hope to get involved with startups. In the comments, I'd appreciate any and all advice, as well as feedback on how to improve the site.\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39643833\nPoints: 144\n# Comments: 24",

It's an alternative to tools like Celery for Python and BullMQ for Node.js, primarily focused on reliability and observability. It uses Postgres for the underlying queue.\nWhy build another managed queue? We wanted to build something with the benefits of full transactional enqueueing - particularly for dependent, DAG-style execution - and felt strongly that Postgres solves for 99.9% of queueing use-cases better than most alternatives (Celery uses Redis or RabbitMQ as a broker, BullMQ uses Redis). Since the introduction of SKIP LOCKED and the milestones of recent PG releases (like active-active replication), it's becoming more feasible to horizontally scale Postgres…",

Here's a demo: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u0wAegt79EA\nInterest in designing new chips is growing, thanks to demand from AI and the predicted decline of Moore’s Law. All these chips need to be tested in simulation. Since the number of possible states grows exponentially with chip complexity, the need for verification is exploding. Chip developers already spend 70% of their time on testing. (See this video on the “verification gap”: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtaaOdGuMCc).\nTooling hasn’t kept up.

          "description": "Hi HN! I’m Gabriel, and I’m happy to share a project I’ve been working on for the last few years: Flyde, an open-source visual programming language. Check out the interactive examples and online playground on the website: https://www.flyde.dev.\nIn my last role as an engineering manager for a B2B-oriented product, I authored and reviewed many diagrams for backend applications, mostly for integrations between 2 third-party services. Some of these diagrams were elaborate enough that I started dreaming of a way to simply run a diagram as is; I imagined a “run” button on the top-right corner of the screen that would execute the diagram without the need to translate it into code.\nThat led me down a rabbit hole of exploration and experimentation, from tools like Zapier, Pipedream and Make, which are great for automating “backoffice” stuff, and up to NodeRED, NoFlo.js and the great work of J. Paul Morisson on Flow-Based Programming. I failed to find a tool that would answer my needs - a tool that balances a new level of abstraction, manages to stay powerful and flexible, and most importantly, integrates with the existing ecosystem, and doesn’t replace it. I built Flyde as an attempt to answer that need.\nFlyde is designed to complement and enhance traditional textual coding, not to replace it. It includes a VSCode extension, it seamlessly integrates with existing TypeScript/JavaScript code and can run on Node.js and in the browser.\nI believe that as we delegate more coding tasks to AI, we’ll assume the role of an architect rather than a programmer. This shift will require tools that focus more on orchestration and high-level troubleshooting and less on low-level functionality.\nI’d love to hear your thoughts and feedback on Flyde’s direction!\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39628285\nPoints: 185\n# Comments: 83",

          "description": "Hi HN! Erik here from Banana (formerly the serverless GPU platform), excited to show you what we’ve been working on next:\nFructose\nFructose is a python package to call LLMs as strongly typed functions. It uses function type signatures to guide the generation and guarantee a correctly typed output, in whatever basic/complex python datatype requested.\nBy guaranteeing output structure, we believe this will enable more complex applications to be built, interweaving code with LLMs with code. For now, we’ve shipped Fructose as a client-only library simply calling gpt-4 (by default) with json mode, pretty simple and not unlike other packages such as marvin and instructor, but we’re also working on our own lightweight formatting model that we’ll host and/or distribute to the client, to help reduce token burn and increase accuracy.\nWe figure, no time like the present to show y’all what we’re working on! Questions, compliments, and roasts welcomed.\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39619053\nPoints: 108\n# Comments: 62",

          "description": "Hi, I'm Will. I'm 24, autistic, and have OCD tendencies. I'm learning to code and this is my first public project. I’d really appreciate your feedback and encouragement!\nThis project lets me solve some of my OCD problems online. There are a couple of parts of the forums that I visit – Space Battles, Sufficient Velocity, and Questionable Questing – that I want to remove. Specifically, I hate seeing indicators of how much is left in a forum thread, because I keep thinking about how much content is left. It stops me from immersing myself in the story. It stressed me out. Before I learned to code, I'd use my hand to block the total chapter count so I could read the blurb and see the word count. I would do my best to ignore the page navigation bar except for the next page button, but I usually ended up failing. One of the reasons I always read in full-screen Safari is that I didn't have to see the tab name that always had the page number. I learned not to hover my cursor over the window because it would tell me the page number.\nThis project is a series of userscripts that hide those indicators. I coded the userscripts in JavaScript, and I used https://github.com/quoid/userscripts as the system. Despite the fact I didn't know what a userscript was until I started coding them, AI assistance allowed me to code them with minimal help from my brother, Stevie. Khanmigo helped me plan, write, and debug code. ChatGPT taught me the theory. Part of the reason I coded a lot faster with the later userscripts is I knew enough to realize when AI was talking about something irrelevant and redirect it. One cool moment was when I correctly predicted I didn't need to code different userscripts for SpaceBattles and Sufficient Velocity because Sufficient Velocity used to be part of SpaceBattles.\nI find it relaxing not to have to worry about accidentally seeing the chapter count or the final page number. Maybe they’ll help one of you!\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39618062\nPoints: 55\n# Comments: 17",

          "description": "Hi HN, we're the co-founders of Greptile, a tool that can accurately answer questions about complex codebases. Developers use us to spend less time wrestling with codebases and more time actually writing code. Here's a demo: https://youtu.be/qI24eKO1YX0. You can try it on 100 popular repos here: https://app.greptile.com/repo, and on your own repo (if you give permission - more on that below) here: https://app.greptile.com.\nWe are far from the first people to try \"RAG on your codebase\". We focus on full codebase comprehension: using LLMs to accurately answer difficult questions with full context of large, complex, and even multi-repo codebases.\nSimple RAG alone is not sufficient for this task. Codebases aren’t like most PDFs, docs, or other similar data types. They are graphs—complex puzzle…",

Steps in the workflow (builders) are chained together based on a topologically sorted built from the predefined input & output.\n3. No servers spin up (like Conductor/Cadence) - the orchestrator is low level and meant for simplifying business logic.\n4.

          "description": "I am excited to announce the project I am working on: an advanced mobile app profiler for Android. Its primary purpose is to optimize app performance and make it faster. Additionally, it serves as an excellent debugging tool.\nThe main distinction between existing tools, such as Perfetto and the Android Studio Profiler, is the ability to synchronize the trace with a video recording of your app. This allows you to see the app's UX alongside what's occurring within the app to identify what's causing slowdowns.\nAnother key feature is the ability to click on any slice and view the cross-thread execution path of function calls, tracing from a user action to the selected slice. This makes it easier to identify performance regressions: slow functions, suboptimal network calls, or functions clogging the main thread.\nAdditionally, we have implemented smart code instrumentation that has a minimal impact on performance.\nI am one of the developers of this tool. The project is in active development and are eager for feedback from Android developers. You can try it out at https://crpath.app\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39543275\nPoints: 10\n# Comments: 0",

I built an open-source data copy tool called ingestr (https://github.com/bruin-data/ingestr)\nI did build quite a few data warehouses both for the companies I worked at, as well as for consultancy projects. One of the more common pain points I observed was that everyone had to rebuild the same data ingestion bit over and over again, and each in different ways:\n- some wrote code for the ingestion from scratch to various degrees\n- some used off-the-shelf data ingestion tools like Fivetran / Airbyte\nI have always disliked both of these approaches, for different reasons, but never got around to working on what I'd imagine to be the better way forward.\nThe solutions that required writing code for copying the data had quite a bit of overhead such as how to generalize them, w…",

          "description": "Hey HN, I’m Pierce. Today I’m open sourcing a beta of Mountaineer, an integrated framework for building webapps in React and Python.\nI’ve written a good 25+ webapps over the last few years in almost every major framework under the sun. Python and React remain my favorite. They let you get started quickly and grow to scale. But the developer experience of linking these two worlds remains less than optimal:\n— Sharing typehints and schemas across frontend and backend code\n— Scattered fetch() calls to template data and modify server objects\n— Server side rendering / gateway support\n— Error handling on frontend fetches\nMountaineer is an attempt to solve those problems. I didn’t want to re-invent the wheel of what Python and React are good at, so it’s relatively light on syntax. It provides one frontend hook for React apps and introduces a MVC convention on the backend for managing views. Support files are generated progressively through a local watcher, so IDE type-hints and function calls work out of the box.\nIt’s more intuitive to explain with some code, so pop over to the Github if you’re interested in this stack and taking a look:\nGithub: https://github.com/piercefreeman/mountaineer\nMore context: https://freeman.vc/notes/mountaineer-v01-webapps-in-python-a...\nWould love to hear your thoughts!\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39524874\nPoints: 89\n# Comments: 34",

We help companies get HIPAA compliant fast, with 1-click infrastructure, streamlined legal policies, and real-time monitoring. Here’s a quick demo: https://youtu.be/mQbb5mprsUA.\nHIPAA is a US federal law passed back in 1996 that sets standards for protecting sensitive health information. Here’s an article that breaks it down pretty simply: https://www.getdelve.com/blog/quick-guide-to-hipaa.\nMost companies that process health information in the US need to become HIPAA compliant, a process that can be long and expensive. At our previous health tech company, we spent 6 weeks (and tens of thousands of dollars) on getting compliant.

There are thousands of cool personal sites out there, with amazing ideas on them, but there’s nowhere to easily search through. So we built a simple site that indexes 7k+ personal sites [0]. We were inspired by Derek Sivers’ Now page movement [1] and other IndieWeb directories [2], but we figured that it would be more useful if we:\n* Let you search directly across personal sites without having to visit them\n* Take the content from 3 specific pages, /about, /now and /ideas, to structure everything\n* Define /ideas pages as a space to articulate things you want to work on\nWe hope this’ll be a cool place for people to find others to collaborate with - would love your feedback. If you’d like your site to appear at the top, add it via the form and add a last updated date of today (any format). It’s completely open source (MIT) and open to contributions [3]!\nPeter & Louis\n[0] gathered from: 1) https://nownownow.com and similar sites 2) checking all HN posts since 2020 with more than 100 upvotes\n[1] https://nownownow.com\n[2] https://personalsit.es\n[3] https://github.com/lindylearn/aboutideasnow\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39511714\nPoints: 302\n# Comments: 74",

Today we’re excited to share R2R (https://github.com/SciPhi-AI/R2R), an open-source framework that makes it simpler to develop and deploy production-grade RAG systems.\nJust a quick reminder: RAG helps Large Language Models (LLMs) use current information and specific knowledge. For example, it allows a programming assistant to use your latest documents to answer questions. The idea is to gather all the relevant information (\"retrieval\") and present it to the LLM with a question (\"augmentation\"). This way, the LLM can provide answers (“generation”) as though it was trained directly on your data.\nThe R2R framework is a powerful tool for addressing key challenges in d…",

          "description": "Hi friends, I've been making attempts for over 4 years now to make money from my pet-project and finally leave my job and never think of it again. I do small saas and. online projects (sites under amazon).\nBut I am saddened by the fact that I invest hundreds, thousands of hours of my personal time, spent 5 000$ on testing, experiments with advertising, quit my job, worked fulltime for the last year - and still still never managed to earn. My result is only $200. Heck, in all 4 years. I want to live this life, to see the beauty of the world - but instead I spend my life working hard and trying to pluck a star from the sky. I want to finally live this life.  To be free.\nI have a question for the community? Where do you find the strength to keep going? What keeps you going and energizes you? I'm tired of trying, the work seems endless. I am grateful for everyone's advice.\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39504470\nPoints: 37\n# Comments: 30",

          "description": "Hey Hackers! My name is Alex and I’ve been working on this project for the past 8 months with the support of Figma Creator Fund. I’d love to hear your thoughts from your experience working with designers & component libraries.\nI started out in design and later got into coding, so I understand both sides really well. I did UX Design for 12 years at startups, at my own studio and at Wix, and then worked as a front-end dev at Wix for 2 more years.\nI've noticed a common problem: most component libraries work great for devs but not so well for designers.\nIn my experience working with big teams, I've felt this frustration firsthand. Instead of focusing on making products, we end up arguing over small details and terms.\nIn Functional UI Kit, each comp has dedicated story in Storybook. Copy pasting from Dev Mode in Figma just works, Figma variables and CSS variables match, auto Layout is mirroring the same box model structure & the CSS architecture shields you from style collisions.\nIt leverages all the latest Figma features to the MAX. Including the latest: Annotations, and of course: Dark Mode.\nI hope you try it and let me know what you think.\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39504200\nPoints: 19\n# Comments: 2",

          "description": "For years, I have been obtaining free annual credit reports (annualcreditreport.com) which must be provided by law. Recently, for the first time, when I tried to obtain my Equifax report, I was prompted for an email address and a mobile phone number, a new requirement that apparently cannot be bypassed.  The other two bureaus, and Equifax previously, confirmed identity by asking knowledge based questions.  They do not need my phone or email for anything.\nNext, trying to obtain the report by phone instead of web site per instructions, I got to the point where I entered my ZIP code on the phone keypad, the voice menu system correctly repeated the number back to me, but every time I press 1 to indicate it is correct, the system acts like it got an invalid response and only gives me the option to enter further information by voice, not by the phone keypad.  Just as with my phone number and email, they do not need to record my voice to provide my report.\nI wrote a complaint to the annualcreditreport firm earlier this week, no response yet.\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39485259\nPoints: 50\n# Comments: 15",

          "description": "I love urban planning and think the way we interact with the built environment is hugely impactful to individuals. But I also think that most people have been trained to take the built environment as a given rather than something that they have partial ownership of. By building a place to discuss their community on a hyper-local scale, I’m hoping to encourage residents to feel like they are an important piece of their city.\nI thought building a sort of spatial forum, where city residents can discuss the little annoyances in their neighborhoods, might help people a) start thinking about which parts of the built environment bug them and b) realize that other people in their neighborhood probably have the same complaint. Of course, I know that local politics can turn nasty quickly, hence the name of the site: I’m hoping to keep discussion focused on potential fixes for each problem.\nIf you’re excited about this but your city isn’t on the list, I’m happy to add it as long as you promise to make at least one post. It’s extra helpful if you go to geojson.io and create GeoJson for a closed polygon that marks where you think the bounds for your city should be (doesn’t need to correlate with official city boundaries), but I’m happy to guess and do that part myself. Let me know here or by email if you want your city added!\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39484685\nPoints: 39\n# Comments: 12",

          "description": "Last summer there was an Ask HN[1] about a Nature article that said bluring the blue and green color channels on screen may be good against early myopia development. The OP wanted such software and there was none available.\nSo I quit my job and implemented this software, did a short video with a 3D artist about it.\nTurns out marketing is expensive, so I made an open source browser extension version too.\nHow it works?\nThere is a small neural network on the retina that tries to detect if the eye is far-sighted(most people are born far-sighted), and it is producing dopamine to slow or increase eye growth rate. It is not very smart, and if you do a lot of near-work it can think you are still hyperopic, causing further myopia progression.\nSo, based on the refractive properties of the eye the software calculates the signal that would convince the retinal neural network that the eye is long enough, so it would produce dopamine, a known signal to stop axial eye growth. (based on myopic defocus LCA from the papers[2][3])\nSome myopia control techniques work similarly, like MiSight and Hoya lenses.\nSince then I got a Neurobiologist co-founder and the goal is to best understand the Retinal NN to create the best anti-myopic effect that does not interfere with productivity.\nThe effect can be tried live on the site. Also check out the github repo. Any questions suggestions welcome!\n[1] https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37019143\n[2] https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-26323-7\n[3] https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S00144...\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39484590\nPoints: 4\n# Comments: 2",

          "description": "Hi all, excited to share our latest work, OK-Robot, which is an open and modular framework to perform navigation and manipulation with a robot assistant in practically any homes without having to teach the robot anything new! You can simply unbox the target robot, install OK-Robot, give it a \"scan\" (think a 60 second iPhone video), and start asking the robot to move arbitrary things from A to B. We already tested it out in 10 home environments in New York city, and one environment each in Pittsburgh and Fremont.\nWe based everything off of the current best machine learning models, and so things don't quite work perfectly all the time, so we are hoping to build it together with the community! Our code is open: https://github.com/ok-robot/ok-robot and we have a Discord server for discussion and support: https://discord.gg/wzzZJxqKYC If you are curious what works and what doesn't work, take a quick look at https://ok-robot.github.io/#analysis or read our paper for a detailed analysis: https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.12202\nP.S.: while the code is open the project unfortunately isn't fully open source since one of our dependencies, AnyGrasp, has a closed-source, educational license. Apologize in advance, but we used it since that was the best grasping model we could have access to!\nWould love to hear more thoughts and feedback on this project!\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39483482\nPoints: 278\n# Comments: 52",

          "description": "There are so many distributions and so much discussion around which to use. For a new person it's pretty confusing and it gives the impression that the particular distribution you use is very important and your selection should be tailored very specifically to your use case.\n Yea, I know there are major differences in some cases between distributions, but for most people (and certainly new people) I think that any of the mainstream ones should be fine. \n It would be cool if there was like a default Linux that everybody agreed was for most people, along with others for the like 20-30 percent of people that really need or want something particular in their distro.\n I'm not saying that I personally am confused. I started with Arch and I use Debian now and I'm very happy with it. I understand the differences between distros reasonably well, but do not claim to be an expert. \n As a practical matter I understand that this would be difficult to accomplish. \n    submitted by    /u/Odd-Distribution2887  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I have been several years testing distros, not so many to be honest, but there have been a bunch. Up to this point, I reached the thinking that if you want to have a stable distro, your main choice is Debian, while in contrary, if you want bleeding edge packages, you may run Arch (or another rolling release). Yes, there are a lot of different distros out there, but to me feels like you can achieve most of what they can do with Arch or Debian, because they are basically forks of them (kinda I'm at the sustainable peak at the Linux Dunning-krugger effect).\n ​\n Now I use Debian, but for me, pisses me off not receiving updates for weeks. The system is pretty stable, and is a solid base, but that fact, pisses me off. I used to have (and love) Fedora, which, for me, was that sweet spot between rolling release and stable release, but how RHEL behaves lately, pisses me off, and sadly, it made me move away from Fedora. So yeah, I try to stay away from the more \"corporative/privative-like\" distros (so yeah, no Ubuntu also), because if I had to go with that, I'd just stick to Windows.\n ​\n So yeah. I cannot feel relaxed with Arch with the possibility to breaking up just updating the system (I know is something you can avoid if you stay away from AUR, but still is a posibility), and I am tired of falling behind on updates for being in Debian, so I am ready to test new things. Maybe, I can give another opportunity to Arch, or even, try new stuff, such as Open SUSE for example, but I would like to know if the specific distro you might suggest receives updates from time to time, and also, if it is stable, and I can feel relaxed on the system breaking on me.\n [EDIT]: Some of you have said me that RHEL is an upstream of Fedora, and not the other way around, so sorry for the inconvenience, and that may be an option. Also, for now, I have also considered openSUSE Tumbleweed, but I have to give it a try firstly.\n    submitted by    /u/Raulduri  \n [link]   [comments]",

I wanted to use the plethora of iTerm2 color schemes on Linux and I found a project on GitHub that could do it, but I had to tweak code to make it work. I then found that it only did half the job. You have to append the list of profile ID in dconf or the profile, while imported, won't be available for use.\n The basis for my code was this repo. It kinda works but, like I said, I had to tweak it make it fully usable. I created a new repo, and I did credit the original because their work helped me accomplish my goal.\n I hope you find it useful.

So threw hands in the air and started binging Linux OS videos on YouTube. \n My initial attempts were with virtual box... couldn't get it to work. So ended up creating USB ISO files and just sorta kept failing at booting or installing distros until FINALLY, I just totally replaced Windows with Zorin 17.1 OS.

More like a well-used car that has a good paint job still.\n I know, I know. Some of you are going to claim this doesn’t apply to Linux since Linux is an OS or kernel, with a billion different flavors, and not a website. \n But we have been seeing it in Windows IMO since version 8 or 10. Maybe sooner for some folks. We’ve seen it in iOS as the fruit phones and laptops, etc. have not really put out anything mind-blowing or usefully new except the M1 chip.\n When is the last time NVIDIA or AMD really put out something huge like we used to see back in the day? I’m talking GPU, not CPU. The fact that Intel could create their own dGPU and start releasing products at the midrange audience in their first generation of Arc cards should cause a question to form.\n Linux seems to be the only thing that I use on a daily basis that hasn’t started this platform decaying yet. Is it because we are forced to learn how to use Linux, or maybe we see this cool programs like Vi or Kile, maybe a command like awk or grep, and we fixate on it until we beat it to death and move on to the next thing? Or is it that we keep learning because we want to learn more?\n Mind you, I’m not an analyst or even have a college degree.

Also, it's pre installed, when you go to a regular store all the laptops have windows installed unless they're MAC's, heck, many people don't even know what an operating system is.\n Somebody pointed out, that there's so many distros people would have dilemma which one to choose, so somebody proposed that making a 'general'/'official', user friendly distro which would be marketed and advertised, and it would be the default option to consider for companies making software would help it.\n Because proprietary there's a whole company, but there are many Linux distros (not like it's bad, but i'm speaking of general users)\n    submitted by    /u/exiled-redditor  \n [link]   [comments]",

So how does the community ensure the quality and standard of the code base?\n The reason behind asking this question is, I work for a large company where there are say around 50 developers across two development centers (both in different countries) and we are having this problem where we are not able to maintain the modularity of the code. The developers in our center develop the code differently, the developers in other country develop it differently. This difference is causing a lot of problems. Because when we use their base code, we are not able to modify it as efficiently as we should. And I think they face the similar problem. \n So what process does Linux uses to maintain the quality, especially the modularity of the code base?\n    submitted by    /u/4ChawanniGhodePe  \n [link]   [comments]",

There are plenty of good free powerful software that are windows only. Plus, all of my game library with my Nvidia card.\n Now, I have spent most of my adult life using Linux. I discovered it as a teenager but it took some time for me to fully transition. Now at 33 nearly 34, it is more comfortable to me than any other system, way above macOS which still use because MacBooks are the best laptops for me.\n The point of this post is that while I don't feel I wasted my time, it has made me appreciate what I truly value in a computing system and in life in general: Having as much control of your environment as possible.\n I recently started photographing again, and where I thought I would be using good software exlusive to windows, the best are open source and available in all platforms. I do not use LightRoom, I will never pay Adobe. I will miss the proprietary software that the camera companies make for editing RAW files, but I have so many options it does not matter.\n Gaming is a trifle now. The kind of games I like to play can either run on proton or have a linux release. \n More than can control, it is owning the production. It feels so limiting to ever wait on companies to make the things you want. Something propriety is not something I can own. The world I want to live in is one where information is freely shared, bettering everyone.\n I will now end this poorly thought out rant and rave.\n    submitted by    /u/DestructiveDumbass  \n [link]   [comments]",

I tracked either the generic package or a shell/wm package for these stats. Of course a lot of discrepancies come from Debian being more of an enterprise/stable distro, for example more KDE users would most likely be on Arch instead.\n Out of 135773 downloads:\n * GNOME (gnome-shell) - 44.15%\n * XFCE4 (xfwm4) - 23.3%\n * KDE Plasma (plasma-desktop) - 18.72%\n * Cinnamon (cinnamon-desktop-environment) - 7.5%\n * LXQT (lxqt) - 3.63%\n * i3wm (i3-wm) - 2.7%\n * Sway (sway) - 0.91%\n    submitted by    /u/ThePix13  \n [link]   [comments]",

Upon stepping into the booth and starting to learn about how the mixerboard and basic AV setup works, I noticed 2 separate PCs set up - a basic HP gaming laptop running only Streamlabs for the live feed and a second desktop that basically does everything else (recording, playing videos/music, sharing song lyrics on the remote dual mounted displays, etc). I noticed that the desktop was running Ubuntu Mate and asked the AV guy about it. Simply put, his response was \"It just works and the lower headroom of Linux completely eliminated random freezing and glitches during church services\".\n To be fair, the desktop itself was running an older Pentium processor with only 4 GB of RAM, but the fact that the church's reason for using Linux to essentially power their daily services because it \"simply works\" was a really eye-opening experience for me and a reminder that Linux as a desktop is definitely not just a hobbyist OS and gave me an even greater level of respect for the open source apps that we often take for granted.\n    submitted by    /u/chozendude  \n [link]   [comments]",

The rendering itself is amazing with defaults; however, the biggest problem was the regular weight font thinness on small sizes with grayscale antialiasing (AA). Subpixel AA is a no-go for me, as my eyes simply cannot stand its color fringing. Thus began my journey to \"perfection\".\n A few months before I started gathering all the information and made a small project with a set of advanced tweaks for FreeType, including customized stem-darkening with multiple presets to make it more pleasing to the eye, and just finished setting up a public repository.\n Without further ado, if anyone is interested in trying it, here it is: https://github.com/maximilionus/freetype-envision\n Project is still young, no packages are yet available, but a small install-uninstall scripts with a \"nice\" README are already here.

          "description": "So I found an interesting way to stress test a single CPU core/thread with bc while watching a YouTube video. Calculate a perfect number using a 7 digit seed.\n So a perfect number is any number where if you add the divisors, including 1 but not itself, you get that number. A good example is 6 which has the divisors 1, 2, and 3. So 1+2+3=6 hence it is a perfect number. You can find any perfect number by the following formula: (2p - 1) * 2p-1 where (2p - 1) equals any prime number. Of course you can just take the equation and plug in number for p that you want and get a result but it won't be perfect.\n So I went and ran the equation in bc and tested it out for a bit. Up to a 5 digit number and my computer had no issue. I switched from random numbers, or as random as my fingers can get on a number pad, to all 9s for the fun of it with 5 digits, because 5 9s and all that. My computer had no issues with those 5 9s but did give a bit of a pause with 6. So I went with 7 and bc spit back an error. Ok back to bash then to try it one more time and this time it worked. With p=9999999 my computer took 6 minutes and 13.032 seconds, according to time, to complete the equation. I'd say not bad for a 9th gen i7 in a laptop.\n Of course this doesn't count for any benchmarks but it was fun.\n Edit: Fixed the perfect number explanation.\n    submitted by    /u/MonsterRideOp  \n [link]   [comments]",

Great, right? So I ordered a cheap 128gb drive to swap it with, BUT when installing any linux distro the installers cannot see this 128gb drive and I don't know why.

I delete the other partitions. I expand the one existing one.\n First GParted decided that in order to expand the NTFS partition, I HAD to \"move the filesystem to the left\". I was perfectly fine leaving it on the right end and leaving the left end blank, but nope, \"move to the left and grow\" is one operation and I had no way to opt out. Fine. I guess.\n I started the operation, and the expansion took about 5 seconds and it even auto mounted the partition for a few seconds. So I was right. But then GParted helpfully unmounted it for me and started transferring 1.3TB from one end of the drive to the other.\n It's been running for almost 12 hours now. This is in a VirtualBox VM with the disk passed through as a raw USB device.\n I went to move the window between monitors. It naturally turned into a tiny square when I dragged it over. When I let go and the window expanded (back to an identical resolution even), it showed me what you see in this screenshot. My transfer, canceled. And now the \"rollback\" is longer than what was remaining.\n No confirmation prompt. Nothing. It just...canceled a working low level drive operation. How, GParted devs, do you think this is acceptable?!?!?!\n Will you please just let go of my drive???\n    submitted by    /u/gjack905  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "So recently I had a very specific problem at work. My simulation created a 27 GB txt log file (on purpose for debugging purposes) and I wanted to streamline the text file to analyze the log file more easily.\n I tried the most obvious way to just open it with a text editor, both GUI or CLI and surprise surprise that did not work. My temp folder is not big enough to load 27 GB text file. So i was at a loss of what to do, how to do i streamline this log file if I can not open it.\n Then I remembered of this tool that i heard of but never really paid attention to know as \"awk\". At first it seemed like magic just typing random letters like \" '$0 ~ // {}' \". How does this magic even work? But it was my only option for this so i tried. I learned it quite fast and I managed to streamline my log file from 27 GB to 200 MB in 2 awk commands. It took exactly 10 sec to write it in the terminal and for it to finish.\n I was amazed. I am now a HUGE fan of awk and will use it as much as i can. It is now my go to tool for txt file manipulation.\n Honestly, I do not know how I would solve this problem on Windows, is there a thing like awk for windows?\n ​\n Anyway, this got me thinking, what else am i sleeping on.

Although I'm confident in my data structures and algorithms skills, I'm genuinely anxious about this assessment.\n I've reached out to the recruiter for guidance, but haven't received a response in two days.

          "description": "GNOME seems to like to copy the macOS window overview and combined titlebar/toolbar philosophy (CSD). But it seems they've done this without actually understanding what makes it work on Mac.\n On Mac you have the global menu. It lets apps have a vast amount of commands, and they're easily browsable. Menu search is even included by default at the OS level and you can set keyboard shortcuts on anything. This lets apps like Terminal have no controls at all on the window but still plenty of power user features.\n Since GNOME moved away from a global menu, all controls not on the toolbar are forced to fit in the hamburger menu. This means what goes in there is usually drastically reduced, and/or the menu is huge and unwieldy. It also creates this persistent meaningless icon in every app that you have to click and remember what's there and what's not, unlike a menu which can have descriptive text reminding you of what it contains.\n CSD doesn't work well without a global menu, and the hamburger button is a bad band-aid. So what is the actual goal or philosophy behind it? Saving vertical pixels by removing a menu isn't very convincing, given the size of screens and the thickness of header bars. The header bars are less customizable than toolbars and offer less space to click and move the window. The hamburger menu takes longer to navigate and visually parse. It's not simpler, so I don't understand what was accomplished.\n    submitted by    /u/tectak  \n [link]   [comments]",

I actually do agree with Gabe Newell when he said that \"Linux is the future of gaming\" I want to instead share my feedback on how Linux can maybe grow and give my feedback to the Linux community. I also want users to be tame and respectful remember that this is just my opinion and if you don't like my feedback or opinion that's completely fine.\n ​\n Package Managers: I think having multiple Package Managers like apt, pacman and dnf is a bit overkill. I think Linux should take a step back should focus on one package manager that would be much easier for not only software developers but also for new users.\n ​\n App Stores: I do like the idea of going to a app store and downloading the software you want rather than going to website and downloading …",

Although I gave him admin rights on his computer, he never really delved into it, for instance, learning to use the terminal.\n Last week was spring break, a time to enjoy video games! He has many games on Linux (with Steam and Proton, it's easy). However, a popular game wouldn't work. He talked to me about it and started asking questions about Windows...\n A few days later, he went to meet friends and left his computer on. I walked past his room and saw a Windows login screen!!! Holy crap! I felt a bit disappointed inside... there it was, he had jumped ship, moved to the dark side, replacing Linux with Windows. Darn!\n The next day, he came to me in a good mood because he could finally play that game. He then started explaining how he used GParted, did a Chroot because Windows had erased Grub, and then played with Efibootmgr to prevent Windows from erasing grub again, among many other advanced tricks.\n Wow! he had set up a dual boot by himself and developed an incredible interest in Linux. I was amazed.\n    submitted by    /u/hwoodice  \n [link]   [comments]",

Flatpak can handle different architectures, you can even install it on Raspberry Pi OS and download packages for the ARM architecture, however many applications are only built for x86_64 systems.\n I searched online for a bit, and it seems you can use QEMU to run x86_64 on ARM (or vice-versa) and it seems to work quite well (link). I've also searched trying to see if there is an easy way to run flatpaks using Box64, but I haven't found any straightforward instructions.\n When Apple introduced M1 they automatically handled app architecture translation using Rosetta.\n So my question to all of you is, should Flatpak consider automatically running x86_64 applications using box64/box86 for ARM devices? Is it a difficult thing to accomplish? Would integrating QEMU be a more viable option?\n    submitted by    /u/fcrv  \n [link]   [comments]",

After that, I tend to uninstall or not use those tools anymore (in the case of Tauri and that kind of dev tools), but by doing that it leaves me with a bunch of packages in the system that I manually installed, and now I don't know exactly which packages are in use or are just leftovers there that are updated every day.\n Then I discovered Brew and what I thought was: \"What if I use Brew just to install my dev tools and track what I use or not from there\", seriously, Almost every time I do an update there is a pile of \"rust-{whatever}\" to be updated.\n Does this make any sense?

Of course, you're not going to get the same level of fidelity if you're not using an Apple retina display, but even on my average 1080p monitor this makes a huge difference. Why is this option not enabled on any distro? What's the point in having this option built into freetype and leaving it unconfigured for every desktop user?

To ease my transition, I bought a new computer, wiped the preinstalled Windows off the drive (Lenovo still doesn't provide Linux as a preinstalled option in the US), and installed Linux.\n To allow me to slowly wean myself off too many years of Windows, I installed FreeRDP on Linux and continued to use my Windows machine remotely until most of my Windows programs were replaced with their Linux equivalents (oh how I love how many open source programs are actually better than their Windows-based commercial counterparts!).\n Now I'm finally at the point where I can use less of FreeRDP and I had an epiphany:\n Since FreeRDP doesn't work very well with my Linux workflow, I'm going to install an OpenSSH server on my Windows machine to facilitate my access to it from Linux until I have time to hammer the final nail in my Windows coffin.\n And that's when it hit me. Shit. I'm a Linux user now. So much so that I'm going to turn my Windows machine into just another ssh endpoint, and I'll be more productive for it.\n The road to get here was a little bumpy, and I still have a little ways to go, but I'm sailing now.\n Thanks Linux (and, I guess, thank you Microsoft for releasing something as vile as Windows 11, and forcing me to evaluate greener pastures).\n    submitted by    /u/BinkReddit  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "This might seem silly but I've been using Linux Mint 21 since September and I haven't used the terminal for anything. I'm not new to Linux, nor am I just a dabbler. I used Linux back in high school for my IT classes, I used it on my personal laptop, and I've switched between Linux and Windows over the years on my main PC. I also use Linux at work and work with Linux servers often. \n Back in September, I switched to Linux Mint 21 as my daily driver. My goal was to use Windows as sparingly as humanly possible. I did it for myself and my privacy, but I also wanted to prove some points, and one of those points was, you can use Linux Mint without using the terminal at all. And... I was correct. \n People, especially skeptics (who don't even use the OS), say that Linux is complicated and you can't do anything without opening up the terminal. I use Linux daily for browsing the internet, being in calls with friends, playing games like Sea of Theives, Battlefield, GTA, and much more. I use it for work, education, and even to record and edit. So far, since September, I haven't needed the terminal for anything. I installed via the GUI; either by going to the official site, or going through the software store. \n ​\n I also helped prove to one of my friends that Linux isn't as bad as it used to be, even letting him play some games and use the system for a while. He's willing to install a small 500GB drive with a Linux distro on it. I consider that a win since he's normally worried about games and other software not working like it should. \n Since you've been using Linux, what is something you would like to bring to the table that might be considered helpful for new people / outsiders. Mine obviously was, with the right distro, you won't need the terminal, it's helpful but not vital. \n    submitted by    /u/BouncyPancake  \n [link]   [comments]",

I used Ventoy to write today's daily build isos to one USB stick. Any issues I report are *not* intended as criticisms of that flavour since these daily builds are *not* expected to necessarily be stable, particularly at this stage.\n Booting: All the flavours booted successfully. All of them ran the desktop environment successfully except Kubuntu, where KDE Plasma kept crashing if you did just about anything.\n X11/Wayland: Nothing to see here as the live environments all use X11 as a safe default, they will switch to Wayland in some cases when actually installed.\n Pipewire/Pulseaudio: All fully switched from pulse to pipewire apart from Kylin and Unity which remain on pulse as of today. (Didn't check if Studio runs Jack as well or something, I was basically looking to see if pulse was gone).\n Installers: All switched to use subiquity with the new snap/flutter interface by default, apart from Kubuntu, Mate and Unity, which currently remain on on the old ubiquity installer, and Lubuntu, which uses calamares. I believe Kubuntu is supposed to be switching to calamares as well.

I chose Mint because of the many recommendations especially for beginners.\n But, now I wanted to help her install a youtube-dl GUI. I installed one from the software manager, but it was outdated and broken (since yt-dlp kinda needs monthly updates to stay working). I spent some time and finally found some AppImage that gets the newest yt-dl version on start. But I assume it will break at some point because of course AppImage does not integrate with the system package manager and my gf will not be able to update it herself.\n Then, I wanted to install KDE Connect. The software manager has it! But it's three years old. I didn't even bother installing it because I really don't want to deal with an issue that then turns out to have been fixed two years ago. The official instructions say to use the package manager version.\n I then looked for flatpaks or other releases and apparently they did have some flatpaks of KDE Connect at some point but not anymore.\n On my laptop with Arch, I just search the official packages and get kdeconnect in the most current version. Same goes for the yt-dl gui. It pretty much always just works.\n How does everyone else deal with this problem? I understand for some software it's fine to have a slow release cycle (esp. on servers), but for lots of desktop apps it seems like such a time sink to deal with old software.\n    submitted by    /u/tehdog  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Over the past 20 years I have tried linux on new, old, weird, sometimes easy machines. I feel like the main thing limiting Linux as an operating system for me and others I know is the sheer amount of errors you can run into, and its so many that it's very difficult to search for them. What makes things worse is whenever you ask a question, you often times get somebody recommending a different distro even on a community dedicated to one. It makes it look like distro-hopping is the only recommended troubleshooting tip for noobs lol.\n People regularly give me computers of various ages and styles, and I like to dedicate them to specific tasks such as 3D printing or running a laser cutter. I always start by downloading like eight or so linux distros, and giving them all a go for the weekend. Sadly like today I regularly can't get many distros to get into the setup process because they have instant errors in the loading process. It's especially bad if you're trying to load onto some strange hardware such as an HP server or a Fujitsu tablet. Things such as Dell Optiplexes are more straightforward, but here lately I've ran into odd issues I can't even really understand. Non-descript (Or sometimes so descript it'd be understandable if you have a logic analyzer hooked up) errors that overlap with a lot of other errors people have for other instances.\n I almost feel like it's somehow gotten harder to get a linux distro to work. If I can't get my foot in the door, then I can't really have any room to learn or try anything. I remember DSL working for my old laptops back in the mid 2000s, and I had slightly better luck with distros in the 2009-2014 era. It used to be that I would spend two or three days trying out linux for something but now the distros fail so fast that after a few hours it feels like a waste of time for no progress. \n Sometimes I feel like computing instead of using an OS as a tool, but Linux doesn't feel like computing on some of those days either lol\n    submitted by    /u/RinoaSG  \n [link]   [comments]",

After some days of use, I notice that I haven't head the fan yet. Concerned, I search for a place to find CPU temperatures, found lm-sensors, installed and ran it... CPU cores are all under 38 degrees celsius. So, my Debian installation is so boring that the CPU is doing almost nothing and saving battery life while doing it.\n What other unexpected benefits have you experienced after changing from Windows to Linux?\n    submitted by    /u/AndersLund  \n [link]   [comments]",

Three to four years ago, I installed Void Linux, but for some reason it would freeze on my machine from time to time. Therefore, even though I was impressed by how the distro was organized, I didn't stay for long.\n So after an exchange with a Void Linux user here on Reddit, I decided to give it another try. And I must say that I am really impressed by it. It boots incredibly fast, and has a very versatile package manager. Everything that I needed on my machine was readily available, even interception-tools. The only thing that I had to manually install is the dual-function-keys plugin for the interception tools.\n The handbook is also very useful to get you started. It helped me to understand how to set up the graphical session and how to enable services.\n Here it is: https://docs.voidlinux.org/\n Overall, I plan to keep it on my secondary machine for now, but I do not exclude it becoming my main distro. \n So, if you are searching for a new, simple distro, and you are familiar with CLI, please consider Void Linux.

          "description": "I have experience with Windоws, OSX, and Linux distributions like Ubuntu, Fedora, and Debian. In my opinion, the font rendering on Linux, especially outside of Ubuntu, has been noticeably worse. I'm curious about the reasons behind this. \n OSX, on the other hand, offers the best font rendering, leading me to speculate whether Apple's involvement in both hardware and software contributes to this superior experience. To test this theory, I connected my MacBook to an external monitor, and the font quality remained impressive.\n While Windows falls somewhere in the middle in terms of font quality compared to OSX, Linux, with the exception of Ubuntu (which is somewhat similar to Windows but slightly worse), exhibits notably poor font rendering. This raises questions about why an operating system heavily utilized for text-based tools, like the terminal, would struggle with font clarity.\n Could it be due to Linux's historical focus on servers, where font aesthetics are less critical? Alternatively, is the blame on the desktop environments? I've experimented with various ones, including Gnome, Cinnamon, KDE, and Xfce, as well as the i3 window manager, but haven't observed significant differences.\n What intrigues me further is the relatively small number of people expressing concerns about this issue. I find myself at a loss; I genuinely enjoy using GNU/Linux, but the subpar font rendering makes it challenging for me to fully commit. Any insights or suggestions on this matter would be greatly appreciated.\n    submitted by    /u/lMrXQl  \n [link]   [comments]",

While this is not a feature unique to my player, I don't know of any other Linux player that gets this quite right. It can stream audio uncompressed over the network via a custom protocol I designed as well. But since it uses Alsa in sophisticated ways, it is somewhat prone to run into bugs in these less well tested areas of the audio subsystem.\n Read the intro writeup here if interested.\n Nothing is packaged yet, so for now if you want to try it out you'll have to build it yourself.

Which works beautifully on Mac. Unfortunately, I couldn't find anything to replace it. The closest thing I found is nerd-dictation, which kind of works, but it's not as smooth as the Mac thing, and it doesn't properly do the punctuation. Also, it seems that nerd-dictation is inference only, meaning that it doesn't adapt to your style and doesn't try to learn patterns over time.\n Can anyone suggest anything better?\n The second, somewhat related use case I have, for which, btw I didn't have a solution on the Mac either, is transcribing .mp3 files.

[released today]\n ✅ Terminal (AGPL): https://github.com/HeyPuter/terminal [released last week] - moving toward POSIX compliance.\n ✅ Phoenix Shell (AGPL): https://github.com/HeyPuter/phoenix [released last week]\n ✅ KV.JS (MIT), i.e. \"Redis in the browser!\": https://github.com/HeyPuter/kv.js [1,300 stars <3 ]\n 🔜 GUI (AGPL): the GUI (Desktop Environment) for puter.com [coming next month]\n 🔜 Office (AGPL): VERY encouraging discussion on another subreddit a while ago [coming soon]\n 🔜 Apps such as Notepad, etc. [coming soon]\n ​\n 4 down 3 to go!

Editing stuff is intuitive, for example, selecting something in the middle of a command that you're writing and replacing it with something else: you just... select that part with the mouse and start writing over it. That's it.\n I've tried multiple terminals, even some with limited mouse support, but nothing comes even close to this. And the idea seems pretty straightforward: a textbox where you write commands and then you execute them. \n I'd gladly use any open source alternative to this, but for the moment I think I'll stick with this one... even if it's closed source and requires login, which I'm not a fan of.\n    submitted by    /u/SomethingOfAGirl  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I recently stumbled upon this youtube video:\n https://youtu.be/t2bVItkJE_c?si=xzgzqVk_ZrAxXJCG\n It talks about the advantages of buying an old IBM ThinkPad rather than a PI for linux projects, home servers, etc..\n Obviously if you wanna build a smart mirror or a drone or some stuff like that you would use a PI, but for other stuff like home servers?\n I think the video makes a great argument that for a cheaper price you have even more more stuff than a PI provides you with, not to mention it comes with a display and a keyboard included.\n I’ve been wanting to make a home server for a while now and the price of a PI with a display and a keyboard is ridiculously high compared to a used ThinkPad L412 with 8GB of RAM, a 128GB SSD, a screen and a keyboard. \n What do you think about this?\n    submitted by    /u/Theorange-of-anxiety  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I got the Oneplus 12 because of its DC dimming and higher PWM at lower brightness, but after a week with it, I was itching to switch back to my S23 Ultra. Thoughts:\n Negatives: 1) Nova Launcher doesn't work smoothly with gesture controls, there's a noticeable lag when I swipe to home. I thought it won't be a big deal, but couldn't stand it after a few days. \n 2) I miss the One Hand Application app for Samsung, that gave me a bunch of side of the screen gesture actions. I tried a few apps off the Google play store but I couldn't find one as reliable. \n 3) I miss the S pen, good for precise actions, remote camera triggers, and the occasional live sketch. \n 4a) I found the colors on the Samsung generally more accurate, with the Oneplus giving most photos a warmer tint than irl. Oneplus sometimes seem to have sharper images though, but that might be due to processing. Night photos and videos seem better on the Samsung. \n 4b) I also miss the 10x camera, which is great for travel and animal photography. \n 4c) No motion photos on the default oneplus camera app. I like the little snippets of video attached to each photo.\n 5) One UI just feels more polished as an OS, more finalized and less improvised. \n 6) Samsung Pay turns NFC on and off automatically which seems more secure to me. \n Positives 1) The screen does feel slightly more comfortable on the OnePlus, so I might switch back to it if my eye strain comes back. I can see the flicker in the Samsung if I wave my fingers across the screen when it's dim.\n 2) I can't seem to get true blacks in dark mode in a few apps on the Samsung, like Instapaper, while the Oneplus has it. \n 3) Screen off gestures are pretty convenient on the oneplus, especially the torch.\n 4) The oneplus is lighter and less bulky. \n 5) The haptics are stronger and feel more satisfying on the oneplus. \n 6) Battery life seems longer and charging is faster. \n Anyone have thoughts that might make me change my mind again? \n    submitted by    /u/onedeering  \n [link]   [comments]",

That's a bit rough on Android.\n You place a widget on the desktop for every device and by click control the connection. On the widget is displayed connection state of Bluetooth profiles and battery level (min. Android 8.1 and device has to support it).\n The App is extremely useful for devices like soundbars, which can be in stand by state. Due Android restrictions is not possible to directly control non-audio devices.\n https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.tom.bluetoothDevicesWidget\n ​\n Highlighted features:\n ✔️ Easy connect/disconnect device\n ✔️ Easy connect/disconnect Bluetooth profiles (calls, music)\n ✔️ Info about connected profiles\n ✔️ Battery status (needs Android 8.1)\n ✔️ Battery status (left, right) for Apple Airpods, Google Buds, Galaxy Buds\n ✔️ Customization - colors, image, transparency, size\n ✔️ Open App after connect\n ✔️ Set volume level after connect Bluetooth device\n ✔️ Notification when Bluetooth device is connected\n ✔️ Quick settings tile\n ✔️ Auto resume of playback - Spotify and YouTube Music is supported\n ​\n Have a nice day!\n Tom\n    submitted by    /u/__TOMAS__  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "22 年 12 月租的现在这间，贝尔路附近，城中村一房一厅，9 楼电梯空房，签合同的时候是 1650+50 管理费，押一付一，水 9 电 1.5 。大概 23 年年尾的时候水电降到水 5 电 0.7 。然后今年 2 月底通知续租房租涨到 2050 ，管理费应该也会涨到 100 ，也就是总体租房成本涨了 450 。给了几天时间考虑，所以开始找房。\n找房体验\n有在咸鱼，豆瓣，小红书，中介，同事介绍这几种方式找房源。工作地天安云谷附近（没错，我就是外包仔）看了下，同样标准的房子租金都在 1900-2100 ，所以回复不打算续了，准备搬。另外也打算换成单间了，这行情不对劲，一个人先苟这段时间。\n然后明显觉得城中村单人租房的价格对不起那质量（也住过一个月 800 的单间）。空房其实很多，我个人觉得是现在这个价格已经完全不值了。要么干脆住远点，可以便宜点或者同样价格住好点，要么拉高预算住好点。\n中介的套路实在太多了，特别是在社交软件上发房源的。这次只接触过两个中介，给我的直接感觉就是，低端租房市场这个价格确实不能支撑好的服务，中介拥有绝对信息差优势的情况下，指望提供优质服务这种期望太过于不现实。\n对打工人来说好的房源其实流动性很低。也就是所谓一手房东直租并且房子也好的房源。总的来说，基本有空房也是马上就租出去了。\n豆瓣小组已经没啥人了，咸鱼感觉真人中介的贴都少，小红书的人是真的多（中介和骗子也同样多）。\n之前租房退房都没有遇到押金不给退的问题，但是小红书上看到很多反馈这个问题的。另外今天同楼的租客表示已经退房了好几天但是押金还没退，感觉我这次有风险了 doge 。\n感觉押金这个事确实很容易动心思，毕竟房东接触到的租客数量多得多。博弈角度看，二房东和中介确实会偏向这种策略。\n如果可以根据报警回执和判决结果对房屋地址进行记录，只精确到多少栋或几号，不到房间号，记录每年有多少因押金不退的报警和判决记录可以查询（可以上链 doge ）的话，应该能改变一下博弈结果。一方面引导受害方主动维护权益，一方面也可以保证信息的真实，最后还能通过消耗公共资源来倒逼社区进行干预 。或者已经有这样的平台了，只是我不知道？\n总的来说，对我而言，目前这个价格占收入比例的情况下，大多数城中村就毫无性价比了。以前毕竟便宜，其他问题都能忍忍。\n感觉下次不想自己慢慢找的话，大概率就是租大牌的品牌公寓了。（如果不限制年龄的话 doge",

          "description": "目前情况\n目前在长三角地区某新一线城市，信息安全行业，go 后端开发工程师，月薪 10K ，工作两年多，三本学历，无大厂背景\n工作时间：9:00-18:30 双休\n优点：\n稳定，没有裁员风险\n通勤时间短（ 10 分钟）\n工作压力不大\n缺点：\n看不到涨薪的希望\n技术栈脱离主流方向，没有大牛带队，感觉进步的很慢（进步慢承认与自身有关）\n面试情况\n最近海投了一波简历，大厂全部已读不回或未读。一些中小厂收到我的简历后，一开始聊的好好的，知道我在职不能很快到岗，并且人在外地，之后就没有后话了。目标薪资主要集中 15K 左右，12K 的也投，没有投外包岗位。目前仍然 0 面试，0offer 不知道是哪里出了问题，希望老哥能帮我分析一下。\n自己分析的问题\n首先就是上面提到的，在职状态+人在外地\n没有个人博客，没有拿得出手的 github 项目，看到有很多岗位都会优先选择有个人博客的\na. 虽然工作中有一些记录的习惯，但没有经营自己的博客，有一点后悔\n技术栈问题。\na. 我主要在做基于 gin 的 web 开发和信息安全方向的应用开发。常用技术栈主要有 gin,gorm,mysql,redis,docker,k8s,了解 elk 。\nb. 在投简历的时候发现大多数岗位都要求的 kafka 或 RabbitMQ 。队列在我的工作中用到的不多，不是很熟悉，目前在想办法突击一下。\n挨骂前的碎碎念\nQ:为什么是深圳？\nA:去深圳工作和生活的想法可以追溯到 18 年的大学时代，多年已成执念。上一次准备去深圳是两年前，去某家公司一面之后，忽然遇到了疫情，全部居家办公，公共交通停止运营，之后就被告知没有名额了。现在明明生活在一个很适合生活的城市，但是无心慢慢生活。\nQ:为什么标题是请老哥进来骂两句？\nA:总是看到今年不要裸辞的建议，也明白这个决定可能太过冒险。目前 0 面试机会，0offer 的情况肯定大部分的原因在自己身上，但是回想两年多的工作经历，自己绝对不是混子，自认为对技术方面是有追求的。不确定我这种情况是不是纯送，职业生涯直接结束哈哈哈。最后的最后，本人心态很好，会站在电脑前认真的看各位老哥的回复，只要不涉及人身攻击，请自由发挥",

          "description": "名字: Jingle Bio\n开发者 / 团队: Luo Baishun\n平台: Web\n请简要介绍下这款产品\nJingle Bio 是一款不需要任何编程基础就可以轻松驾驭的个人网站制作工具，你可以使用 Jingle Bio 来展示自己的作品、技能、经历、成就、爱好等，构建自己的个人品牌。\n\n哪个瞬间让你决定开发这款产品？\n创造 Jingle Bio 的初衷是：我的上一个产品 EarlyBird 在增长上遇到了一些瓶颈，因此我想要构建一个基于 EarlyBird 的子产品来推动 EarlyBird 的增长。 \n在经过几个 idea 的抉择之后，就决定选择耗时最短的 link in bio 赛道，当时我试用了市面上几乎所有 link in bio 工具，包括 Linktree、Bio Link、Beacons、Bento 等，它们各有各的优缺点，于是我决定把这些产品的优点集中到一个产品中来，这就是 Jingle Bio 的雏形。\n相比于同类产品，你觉得它有什么特别之处？\n相比较传统的 link in bio 工具，Jingle Bio 的特别之处在于它已经不仅仅只是链接的集合，而是十多种组件形式（链接卡片、社交媒体卡片、技能卡片、经历卡片、音视频、地图等）组合而成的多媒体名片。\n\n相比较 Bento ，Jingle Bio 不仅可以让用户使用自己的域名，还能够追踪页面中每个组件的表现，让用户可以清晰洞察受众在自己的个人网站关注了哪些内容。除此之外，Jingle Bio 还内置了邮件收集和支付集成，对于有粉丝量的 KOL 来说，提供了直接变现的通道。\n你尝试过哪些渠道推广它？过程中有什么收获吗？\n我们在圣诞节那天公开发布 Jingle Bio 到了 Product Hunt ，并拿到了 #2 Product of the Day，这给我们带来了一个小小的 traction 。 \n随后，我们又提交 Jingle Bio 到了各大目录站，带来了另外一些直接的流量和曝光。 \n我日常会活跃在 Twitter ，会把 pitch 给我认为适合使用 Jingle Bio 来构建个人品牌的推友。 \n长期的计划当然还是 SEO ，目前 Jingle Bio 的 DR 已经来到 25 ，也开始有了自然的搜索流量，未来还将持续投入资金和时间到 SEO 上。\n发布这款产品至今，有哪些反馈让你印象深刻？\n最直接的还是用户觉得 Jingle Bio 抄袭了 Bento ，我对此倒是没有什么要反驳的，但 Jingle Bio 和 Bento 的差异挺多的，受众人群也不完全一样。 \n好的一面是，很多用户制作了在我预期之外的 use case ，比如形式主义文档生成器、旅馆主页、产品的 changelog 等等，这也帮助我开拓了视野，更好地理解 Jingle Bio 可以帮助什么样的人实现品牌价值。\n有哪些产品你觉得应该被更多用户知道？\n哈哈哈我可以说我的上一个产品 EarlyBird 吗？因为验证想法这件事真的太需要被推广了，在我们的社区里，有太多的独立开发者闷着头做产品，到头来发现没有用户对自己的产品感兴趣，所以 EarlyBird 就是以一个方法论来告诉用户：你的 idea 可能很值钱，但没有经过验证的 idea 一文不值。\n在产品出海的路上，你学到最重要的一棵是什么？\n重营销轻技术。不是说技术不重要，而是在产品早期的时候，技术的重要性远不如营销，这其实是无数 indie hacker （也包括我自己）在经历了惨痛教训之后达成的共识。把 80% 的时间用在营销，而把 20% 的时间用在开发，先让产品被更多的人知道，品牌被更多的人记住，才有机会获得足够多的用户反馈，进而推动后续产品的开发。\n介绍一下你自己，以来未来的计划。\n我是一个草根创业者，一个 dadpreneur ，业余时间做做独立开发，已经上线的作品有 Jingle Bio 、EarlyBird、HeyForm、TinySnap 等，同时我还是目前国内最大的独立开发者出海社区「出海去」的联合创始人。 \n关于未来，我会在保持自己独立开发者身份的同时，更多地去投资和孵化一些有热情、有冲劲、有想法的独立开发者，帮助他们快速成长。\n关于 Apptisan\nApptisan 是 Application 与 Artisan 的组合词，意为「与应用背后的工匠交流」。\n每一期我会与来自不同地方的创作者交流，希望通过我们的对话来向更多的用户介绍有趣的产品。\n如果你倾向于英文阅读，欢迎通过 Substack 订阅。如果你想要自荐产品，请填写该 表格，我会尽快与你取得联系。",

          "description": "前天问了 GBA 游戏推荐 /t/1023142 ，收到了超级多回复，没想到这么多老游戏迷\n回帖中有几位问到了我游戏掌机的体验如何\n也有人提到了分辨率比例不对的问题，emmm 其实人家系统已经考虑到了\n这款游戏机内置了两个系统，切换到非官方的“大蒜系统”之后游戏体验大大提升\n先申明，不是广告贴，甚至发帖当天买了 HDMI 采集卡就为了更真实的还原屏幕\n但好像还原不出来，HDMI 输出的画面没带游戏机“外壳”图案，算了，采集卡相机也可以用…\n简单说就是，模拟器会根据不同游戏机平台，套上一层遮罩\n把画面框在一个比例正确的范围里，而不是无脑填充屏幕导致比例错了\n甚至 NDS 模拟器还可以切换上下屏和不同的遮罩和画面布局，不过 NDS 模拟器是我自己刷的\n先上几张 GBA, GBC, NDS 模拟器的实拍效果\n\n\n\n然后放几张 HDMI 输出信号的采集截图，分辨率为游戏机一致的 640x480 ，可以看到玩 GBA 游戏上下有黑边，其实就是对应实拍画面里的“遮罩”，但 HDMI 输出没有带上遮罩，就显示为黑边了\n首先必须是我最爱的 宝可梦\n\n龙珠大冒险\n\n塞尔达 缩小帽\n\n牧场物语\n\nNDS 的宝可梦心金，可能因为 NDS 是我自己刷的，所以输出的画面就带有遮罩了\n\n最后是游戏机 home 页\n\n玩了一两周，操控体验上我觉得比触摸屏好不少，跟 PC 上玩模拟器相比就见仁见智了，可能有人喜欢大屏幕吧\n本贴也不是测评贴，B 站上有挺多测评的，这里只是展示一下它的画面表现还不错，比例 色彩 这些\n最后感谢上次回帖的 V 友，虽然从 20 年前就玩过口袋怪兽，但都不知道漆黑的魅影，这两天已经沉迷了",

          "description": "前情提要\nV2EX：请教各 V 友，购买到盗版教辅资料可以如何维权\n\n免杠提示\n1 、购买前询问过商家是否为正版，商家表示“正版的亲”，我当时对这个价格是存疑的，只是抱着试试看的想法\n2 、我看不惯拼多多和卖盗版的商家，便将我维权过程中的一些经历和方法分享出来\n去年 9 月，我在拼多多的 某图书音像专营店 购买了《教材全解》，收到的书籍均出现纸张歪斜、二维码错位、颜色偏移及纸张偏薄的问题，和后面我在当当旗舰店购买的相比，明显劣质了许多。\n\n\n1️⃣ 第一战 —— 与商家\n在购买前，我询问商家是否为正版图书，商家回复“正版的亲”。随后我将书籍的对比图发给商家，对方沉默、不回复。拼多多很贴心的弹出“是否需要无条件退款”的提示。\n\n2️⃣ 第二战 —— 与拼多多\n我联系了拼多多的客服，提出诉求：查询商家的营业资质，按照消保法的相关规定进行赔偿。\n客服开启售后工单，结果到了 24 号，拼多多擅自将 4 笔订单做退款处理。等待多日，我依旧没有收到商家的营业资质，再联系、再申请，如此重复了十多次。因为拼多多拒绝发送商家营业资质，缺少卖家营业执照，消费者便无法对卖家进行投诉。\n\n我开始转换思路，10 月中旬，我在 12315 投诉拼多多（上海寻梦信息技术有限公司），在店铺首页未有效放置商家的营业资质。直至 10 月底，我才在店铺首页查看到了卖家的营业执照与出版物经营许可证。\n\n不出意外的话，那就出意外了。\n3️⃣ 插曲 —— 与出版社\n过完国庆后，我拨通了出版社的盗版举报热线，多方打听后联系上了一位负责处理盗版的工作人员。\n当听到是从拼多多购买后，工作人员无奈表示，他们也没辙，对方置之不理，无论怎么投诉都没有太大的效果。我询问是否能出具盗版鉴定意见时，工作人员婉拒了我的请求。\n4️⃣ 第三战 —— 与当地 12315\n获取到卖家的营业资质后，11 月 2 日，我重新在 12315 上，以“出售盗版伪劣书籍”发起对卖家的投诉。几天后，市场监督管理局给出了处理意见：\n盗版由主管著作权的部门监管，应拨打 0794-12390 对被投诉对象的盗版行为进行举报。\n当地反盗版举报投诉热线的工作人员回复：\n举报盗版的材料需要盗版图书原书、出版社鉴定证明、商家店铺信息、商品信息、购买交易记录、邮寄地址、快递单号、个人实名举报信。\n嘿嘿，死胡同，你能怎么办？\n⏸ 中场休息\n商家不上传营业资质、虚假邮寄信息、更改店铺名称、拒绝回应。平台的不作为、乱作为，种种把戏使得消费者投诉难上加难，维权无门。平台收到消费者的回应后，打太极、冷处理，消费者投诉到 12315 便下架链接，但店铺还在，卖家换个链接又继续售卖，所谓的处罚不过是隔靴挠痒。\n今天点进店铺看了一下，发现卖家把店铺名车给你、头像都换了，营业资质？\n嘿嘿，都不见了。\n\n💡 可以下手的地方\n📄 卖家营业资质\n如果看到价格相差比较多，那可能就是所谓的“盗版 / 翻版 / 影印书籍”，买的时候我还抱着试试的心态，没想到就翻车了。\n而当你想举报的时候，点击店铺首页，会发现找不到营业资质，怎么办呢？联系客服提交申请，或许有用，但也可能永远收不到那封邮件。\n那么你可以从 12315 入手，以\n该商家无营业资质、无出版物经营许可证、售卖盗版伪劣图书，涉嫌违反《出版物市场管理规定》，发行、销售非法出版物，提供的商品有欺诈服务\nXXXX 平台作为销售平台按《消费者权益保护法》提供销售者真实名称、地址和有效联系方式。\n为由，向上海市长宁区市场监督管理局投诉拼多多（上海寻梦信息技术有限公司）。几天后，你便能在店铺信息中看到卖家的营业执照与出版物经营许可证了。\n📦 寄件人信息\n俗话说，枪打出头鸟。如果你看快递面单的话，有些商家会使用“假地址、假电话号码”，而根据《邮件快件收寄实名管理办法》，物流网点需要登记登记发件人的实名、真实信息。\n\n不妨尝试从侧面施压，向快递公司与国家邮政局投诉，或许能得到卖家的联系方式，有助于向消协投诉。\n🏛 出版社\n有些出版社会比较支持读者举报盗版，并能提供一定的支持，倘若能获取出版社的鉴定证明，那么买到盗版书籍的你，可以向当地 12315 、中国扫黄打非网、当地反盗版举报投诉热线进行举报。\n💨感受\n累。从买书到维权，前后 3 个月，耗费我许多时间、精力，只能说拼多多的客服是好“喜剧演员”。拉扯过程中，我尝试寻找各种方法去解决问题，维权过程中，平台方态度消极、投诉流程冗长，纵容商家为非作歹，让很多想要维权的人望而却步。",

          "description": "转\n3 月 13 日，人工智能初创公司 Cognition AI 发布首个 AI 工具「 Devin 」。该 AI 号称掌握编程工作的全栈技能，可以独立完成整个项目的软件开发。相比曾经辅助程序员编码的 AI 工具「 Copilot 」，Devin 具有独立驾驭整个编程项目的能力，更接近一个人类程序员。\nPerplexity CEO 评价 Devin ，称它所展示的 Demo 意味着业内第一个真正的 Agent 诞生。言下之意是这个产品开始具备推理和规划能力。Devin 目前只提供私人预览版，尚未向公众开放。\n如何使用 Devin 以及它表现如何？\n作为一个软件开发工具，Devin 号称能够在接收到具体任务指令后，自主完成整个项目的开发。目前，Devin 不仅会构建和部署端到端的应用程序、自行查找并修复代码库错误，还可以训练和微调 AI 模型，并修复开源代码库中的错误。\n与人类软件开发者的工作方式相似，用户只需要通过聊天对话框提出需求，Devin 便能够基于需求规划出解决方案，并运用其集成的开发工具，编写代码、定位并修复漏洞、执行测试，同时实时向用户报告项目进展。例如，在收到建立一个展示某区域全部餐馆的网站任务时，Devin 可以自动搜索和收集数据，随后构建并上线该网站。\nf46f483d6f504deaa79849038780023a_1080x57\n在 SWE 基准测试中，Devin 能够端到端地正确解决 13.86%的案例，相比之下，Claude 2 和 GPT-4 分别只能处理 4.80%和 1.74%的问题。SWE 测试使用来自现实世界开源项目的 GitHub 问题来挑战人工智能助手。\n其他 AI 工具只能辅助编码，Devi 的突破在于可以自动完成整个项目\nAI 技术在软件开发行业已非初见，多种工具如 GitHub Copilot 、StarCoder 以及在 Hugging Face 上拥有若干小型 AI 编码模型的 Replit ，以及最近获得 6500 万美元 B 轮融资的 Codeium 等早已广泛应用。这些工具主要侧重于 AI 辅助编码，它们的功能局限于提供编码建议、生成基本代码或帮助解决特定编程问题。\nDevin 则更类似一个 AI 软件工程师，可以独立承担和完成整个软件开发项目。不过，同样依赖于训练数据来学习的 Devin 在理解和解决特别复杂或非标准化问题上能力有限，比如对于一些少见的问题，它可能无法找到最优解决方案，也无法完全模拟人类软件工程师的创造性思维。\nCognition AI 由 Scott Wu 、Steven Hao 、WaldenYan 联合创立，都是 IOI 金牌得主\nScott Wu：联合创始人兼 CEO （首席执行官），毕业于哈佛大学，曾获得过美国三届奥赛金牌，并曾是 Lunchclub 的联合创始人兼 CTO ，为 2012 年至 2014 年连续 3 年的 IOI （ International Olympiad in Informatics ，国际信息学奥林匹克竞赛）金奖得主，IOI 是面向中学生的信息学科竞赛，一年举行一次。\nSteven Hao：联合创始人兼 CTO （首席技术官），毕业于 MIT 计算机专业，之前曾在 Scale AI 、Jane Street 、DE Shaw 、Quora 工作，为 2014 年第 32 届 IOI 金牌得主；\nWaldenYan：联合创始人兼 CPO （首席产品官），毕业于哈佛大学计算机科学和经济学相关专业，曾从事 MIT PRIMES 密码学和机器学习方向的计算机科学研究，为 2020 年第 32 届 IOI 金牌得主。\nCognition AI 成立时间不足两个月，专注解决人工智能的推理问题\nCognition AI 没有透露产品细节，也没有透露 Devin 构建在什么样的模型上，是自研还是基于 GPT 之类的第三方模型。不过，Cognition 称这项工作是其「长期推理和规划方面的进步」的结果。基于推理和规划能力，Cognition 表示「编码只是开始」，未来，该公司还将在其他垂直行业开发类似的 AI 工具。\nCognition AI 公司总共 10 人，目前没有固定办公室——他们散落在硅谷和纽约之间的 Airbnb 以及家庭办公室中工作。虽然成立时间不长，但该公司已获得 2100 万美元 A 轮融资，投资者包括 Founders Fund 和 Twitter （现「 X 」）前高管 Elad Gil 等。\n参考链接：\nhttps://www.cognition-labs.com/blog",

          "description": "今天我去 Apple Store 北京王府井店。本来我想着过来给 iPhone 12 mini 换个电池得了，结果维修人员看了看我的 iPhone ，说我边框的屏幕侧有好几处磕碰，手机屏幕上有很多划痕（不深，就是很浅的多处划痕），这样在修电池的时候很容易把屏幕拆坏，因为换电池需要拆屏幕，而屏幕有磨损的话拆屏幕的时候容易受力不均匀，所以容易拆坏；而一旦拆坏就得我付换屏幕的钱——好像是两千多。\n我一听就无语了，啥，你们换电池把屏幕换坏了还得我赔？？那你们稍微“故意”一点，“不小心”把屏幕拆坏了，我不就只能自认倒霉了么？\n但事实就是如此，我也改变不了。 \n维修人员说，假设这是一台屏幕及边框完好的 iPhone ，换电池时把屏幕弄坏的概率也就 10%，那你这台就得有 90%。\n卧槽……那我换个屁的电池啊。我本来不打算换新 iPhone 的理由是这台手机换电池还能再战。结果换不了电池，那我岂不是只能换手机了。\n然后维修人员接着说，你当时要是买了 AppleCare+就好了，当时买两年再续一年，现在电池健康度低于 80%就能免费换电池（我现在电池健康度已经 64%了，在两年的时候一直坚持在 80%，过了两年就开始狂掉），如果维修时拆坏你屏幕，你只需要付 188 。（我想：甚至我掏钱买了 Apple Care+也得再掏钱。）\n为啥我手机是这种伊拉克成色呢，因为我手机是完全裸奔用的，已经用了三年了，我不喜欢贴膜带壳的手感。\n有没有找维修换过电池的介绍一下经验，这种划痕、磕碰会导致换电池拆坏屏幕的概率有 9 成吗？我感觉我被忽悠了。要是概率这么大的话我只能换个 iPhone 15 了，本来还想换电池再用两年等 17 的……😅",

          "description": "各位前辈大家好，在自己求职过程中遇到了一些问题，现在对于自己的未来道路十分迷茫，希望能得到一些指点。今天一点 Emo 所以文章也一点点长，还请见谅。\n个人 bg\n个人 bg 是双非一本（非杭电这种顶级双非），有计设竞赛的国一，以及一个水竞赛的国奖，两个其他省奖。3 个月的腾讯云实习（其实是云智，但是就写的腾讯云），6 个月的小公司实习。在校经历方面主要是班长、社团负责人之类，很有的说。家在山西。求职意向是 Golang 开发。期望薪资希望能在 15-20k 以上。\n从 12 月下旬开始面试的的，因为那时发现现在这家公司的转正薪资很不理想，所以决定跳槽。年后是面试高峰期，过去两周，平均一天 1-2 个面试（工作日）。也算小有收获，这两周收获了好几个 offer ，但是反而我更加迷茫了。\n遇到的问题\n我的迷茫在于，或许我过去是菜，我一面就挂，哪怕是一些常见的八股文，那我还觉得自己努力，就会有收获。现在阶段，我技术有所提升，但是小厂的 offer 给不到我期望薪资，大厂面试机会都难以获得。\n常规的八股、项目、简单算法，我也都可以说清楚，所以面的一些小厂，基本也都能够顺利斩获。但是大厂有的会深挖项目，比如上周被 IEG 的面试官拷打“你这个服务部署时候是怎么部的，怎么分配的内存、核心等。”这种层次，我现在的确有所欠缺，毕竟当时没有做到这么多，但是也无法准备，不知道该怎么去提升。\n同时我也迷茫在城市选择，离家的远近重要吗？一年就回一趟家。又或是什么城市重要吗？\n我去大城市注定无法安家，去二线城市也是异乡，那安家意义何在？\n女朋友也不敢找，不知道以后会如何。感觉程序员，仿佛是一条看得见悲剧终点的路。\n现阶段 Offer 情况\n现在手头有 4 个 Offer 可选：\n1 、杭州滨江，实习的转正。预计薪资能开到 8-9k *13 （还没 A ），五险实发缴纳，公积金按实发一半的 12+12…",

          "description": "2024 ，第十周，0304-0310\n管住嘴，迈开腿，成为一个新造的人。\n这周达成了人生第一个白金游戏成就，战神 5 。\n\n也看了不少影视剧，沙丘 2 看的是午夜场，太震撼了，物理上的震撼，座椅抖得我感觉都快起飞了！\n\n极简便签\n上周极简便签只在小米上架了，经过这一周，极简便签终于在华为、Oppo 、Vivo 也都上架了。\nVivo 和小米一样，一次就顺利审核通过了\n第一次驳回的理由是隐私政策和申请权限不合格，照着修改了\n第二次驳回的理由是隐私政策中没有关于存储权限的说明，但是明明就有，我就原封不动又提交了一次，并在审核备注里写明位置，于是就通过了\n隐私政策审核驳回了两次的理由是：没有政策的生效/更新日期，但实际上第一行就是\n隐私政策审核驳回的另一个理由是：页面还有非中文版本或者多语言场景。本来我的隐私政策页面是中英双语的，这样不得不把英文部分全部删掉了。\n应用审核驳回的理由是：付费页面里只有隐私政策和用户协议，没有「会员服务协议」，原来在 Oppo 眼里「用户协议」和「会员服务协议」不是一回事。\n而且，我发现隐私政策的审核好像是机审，这个即使被驳回了 App 审核通过后也会上架\n\n极简日记（ iOS ）\n这周做了两点优化：\n优化了添加图片的交互，之前总是卡卡的，通过 Instruments 分析了一下，才发现是之前我自以为是的反优化造成的\n将 Core Data 的单 container 改成双 container ，按照肘子哥的教程成功改造成功\n下周先小范围测试一下，然后提交版本。\n这周有 iOS 开发者遇到了 Xcode Archive 的一个 bug ，我才发现我好久都没有执行过 Archive 操作了，因为好久都没发新版本了……\n抖音「编程课」\n在抖音上刷到了一个自称是一线开发的程序员小姐姐，在线直播教编程。看了一会，就发现这又是一个骗小白的套路，其实就是卖教程。不过这个女孩还是做了一些功课的，起码知道 Java 、JavaScript 和 Python 的不同应用领域，但是再深入一些就开始胡说八道了。\n\n之后，抖音又推荐给我更多这样的主播，微微、辣辣、拽拽、阿纯……这些人都有共同的特点：\n刚开始都是戴口罩，渲染半天气氛后摘口罩\n话术都是一模一样的\n个人主页里的视频没有一个是关于编程的，都是一些电脑使用的小技巧\n\n减肥\n现在年也过完了，老婆孩子也都开学了，我的生活节奏也规律起来，可以开始认真减肥了。\n今年一开始定的目标是减重 10 斤，因为不想减得那么痛苦，就没定太高的目标，不过目前来看，应该可以很轻松就达到。\n我现在就是将减肥当做一个电子游戏，每天做任务、收集道具、刷数据。\n运动\n计划每天快步走一小时，一方面放松心情、放松眼睛，一方面提高心肺功能。本来计划每天走一万步，具体实践下来才发现 5km 也达不到一万步，不过加上一天中其他的步行数量就可以达到一万了。\n周五没去步行，而是去了健身房，本来是打算游泳的，但是又赶上健身房泳池不开放，我去年 11 月买的游泳三件套到现在还没有拆封。跟着抖音上的训练计划推荐，做了背部训练和 30 分钟椭圆机。\n\n我的有氧适能从 2023 年开始就一直低于标准值。之前我还有规律的羽毛球运动，而到了 2023 年我只打了一次羽毛球。不过经过这一周的有氧运动，这个指标也开始慢慢回升了。\n据说低强度的有氧运动，也就只能提升到 30 ，需要更剧烈的有氧运动才能提升到 40 以上。等天气再暖一些，我想买个新的公路车，天气好就出去骑车，天气不好就进健身房。\n\n饮食\n采用 16:8 间歇性断食法，也就是每天两顿饭，晚饭在 5 点前吃完。\n最近一周的早餐基本都是小笼包+馄饨，晚餐也没有高糖高油高盐，中间饿的时候就吃点水果，喝的饮料除了咖啡也都是无糖的。自打进入 2024 年，已经两个多月没点过外卖了，在家自己做饭的次数大大增加。\n我对于食欲方面没有什么太强的需求，并不会想吃什么就想方设法去吃到，碰到了就吃，碰不到也无所谓，过一顿饭我就会淡忘掉。我发现从几年前开始我就对零食、雪糕、甜食失去了兴趣，这些东西完全不能刺激我的多巴胺分泌。",

          "description": "年后简历投了一段时间了，上周把 APP 里的期望薪资下调到下限 30k 才陆续有一些面试（在此之前根本约不到面试），工作日安排起来基本是一到两天排一家面试，但是有面试的都是那些岗位薪资范围里上限是 30k 的的岗位。\n薪资高的岗位，投递的人很多，招聘方可以很轻松地把门槛设置成 211 及以上或者有大厂背景。\n离家近且薪资稍微可以接受的（就是 1~4 公里范围内可以直接骑电瓶车上班的那种，薪资 25k 的），感觉又嫌弃我非计算机相关专业，面试机会也拿不到。\n怎么样才能让自己有比较高的技术护城河呢？我的意思是一来不容易被旧公司裁，二来很容易找到新公司。\n什么全栈，或者说熟悉源码、八股文啥的，都不会让人感觉安全。我觉得开发走到有架构思维/大局观判断就走到头了。比如说张三没看过 babel 源码，但是知道 babel 用了其他库可以将 JS 代码生成对应的抽象语法树，然后当他想做条件编译的时候，知道可以用这个库来帮忙做判断（或者不知道然后强写正则判断），我感觉已经够可以了。再比如说，李四知道 google chrome 官方出了个 npm 包叫 web-vitals ，可以用于检测页面性能数据，那为啥还要知道浏览器的 performance.timing 和那个啥 getEntries 这种 API ，然后一堆属性减来减去自己算呢，调用一个 7 层高阶函数比调用一个 8 层高阶函数显得更底层有优越性吗？再再比如想开发一个开发环境下使用的构建系统，不喜欢硬盘里出现临时生成的文件，然后因为用过 webpack 类的，知道这是可以实现的，然后看了个屁的源码（看了 webpack-dev-server 项目的 package.json ）知道有个叫 memfs 的包可以在内存里模拟文件系统，那不就可以完事告急了吗，然后面试你问我看过源码没我和你说我看了个 package.json ？再再再比如，没弄过 JS 和 wasm 的交互那就不会了吗，那不就是几个 api 的事情吗。还有面试问 webpack loader 或者 plugin 怎么写的，或者 vite 的什么钩子的，感觉好捉急啊，这些 api 、钩子有什么好问的，你只要知道主流的构建工具肯定你想要的时间点的钩子都会给你的，你只要需要的时候翻文档对一下哪个钩子适合塞入你的脚本逻辑就好了，你的主要时间不是找钩子，是在钩子里写你的脚本啊亲（大部分都是读下内容然后改改内容）。突然想起来刚转行的时候碰到过问 jQuery 上用什么 api 去挂自定义函数的，或者后面类似的 vue 上怎么挂的。会抄就很强了，就像学生时代抄数学题答案交差，带着脑子抄就好了。又不是所有人都喜欢去大厂当螺丝钉的。\n感觉建筑专业的、擅长 webgl 的程序员应该在建筑细分行业里会符合我说的这种情况。\n那药学专业的程序员，去做生物分析是不是一个合适的路子，有过来人可以说说吗，最好是做生信这块的。\n我自己调研了下，家边上有不少这方面的工作岗位。有些薪资低的接受本科学历，除了个别经理岗位会需要博士学历外，主体目标人群的学历是硕士，感觉入行门槛没有特别高（对于有经验的员工，学历和专业限制比较松）。而且根据我自己调研的情况，生信似乎不太依赖硬件实验设备，所以感觉挺适合自学转进去的。计算机+非计算机双背景的感觉入行后的门槛高度会让人感觉有比较大的安全感。\n帖子不是按顺序写的，最长的那段是最后写的，写得我有点愤青了。轻喷。",

          "description": "lastday, 失业啦\n公司年前通知我合同到期不续签，今天是我的 lastday ，我也失业啦～\n在这期间，经过深思熟虑，我决定开启自己的 PlanB ，尝试做所谓的自由职业、独立开发者。今天下午办理完离职相关手续后，回到家开始计划起了我后续规划。\n其实提到“自由职业“、“独立开发“这两个词我是不太喜欢的，在没有获得稳定收入前，说白了其实就是没工作的无业人员。但是很多人贴上这两个标签后能蹭到不错的热度获取流量，因此在下也给自己贴上了这两个标签。\n使用企业微信搭建自由职业独立开发工作体系\n在飞书和企业微信之间考虑，主要是一方面想用他们的文档功能记录一些工作内容以便整理发布到我的个人博客，另一方面是想通过它们来管理自己，让自己在独立开发前期能保持正常的工作节奏。\n最近这份工作使用的是飞书，感觉文档功能还不错。以前在腾讯用过企业微信，离职以后就不知道它现在长什么样了，好奇现在有些什么功能。重新装上企业微信，研究了一下相关功能，感觉满足我的需求，再加上我在服务里发邮件是用的腾讯的企业邮箱，所以就它了。（下面的内容看起来像是企业微信的广告，但并不是。）\n无法使用微信群入群欢迎语\n因为我有个用户交流微信群，想研究了一下普通微信群是否可以通过企业微信机器人自动发送新人入群欢迎语。万万没想到把企业号拉进群后它自动成为群主然后把我自己的微信（群主）移出了群聊，一度相当尴尬。要设置自动欢迎语必须要把微信群标记为客户群，但是提示不支持标记，可能是我没有认证企业账号的原因，没有继续深入研究，放弃了。\n我用到的功能\n用到的功能除了文档以外，还有工作台里面的汇报和人事助手。\n汇报用来写日报，记录一天都做了些什么。\n\n人事助手里有个工资条，我想试试用它来记录自己的每月收入。\n\n还有就是手机 APP 上有个打卡功能，想和正常上班一样早晚打卡，通过打卡我觉得可能会让自己更加规律，保持节奏。\n我创建的文档\n建了几个文档分别是：日报、工资条、项目管理。\n\n后续打算在个人博客更新自己的自由职业/独立开发的动态，可能是周更，也可能是月更，看忙闲程度吧。日报用于记录当日工作内容，以便整理发布到个人博客，写这个其实挺耗时的，不过也算是营销自己的工作的一部分。\n工资条模板里面我设置了自己现在的收入来源，不管多少，有过几毛钱也罢，只要到账过的都列上去了（至少证明了这是一种可以继续探索的模式），后续每月月底更新一下。\n项目管理我把自己接下来的工作计划都大概列出来了，并给自己排了个理想的期（每天至少 8 小时，不包揽家务的情况下），已经排到 6 月 27 号了。同时列了一些网站的日常维护和运营工作，以及一些待开发的新功能点记录和其他想法的备忘。\n\n现在迫切想做和需要做的是开发小程序，但是因为我完全 0 基础，需要边学边做，所以之前一直拖延没有开始。\n小程序具体要做些什么暂且先不透露了，因为有一些顾虑，我还没想好到底应不应该像其他独立开发者一样完全地 build in public ，这些问题后续再写。\n结语\n下午回到差不多 5 点左右，一直搞到现在，效率有待提高。今天就先到这里，祝大家生活愉快。",

          "description": "我父亲是一个没什么主见的人，他经常和一位同村的长辈聊天。这个长辈挺成功的，在县城里做过小官。他帮我奶奶办过一个教师保险(我奶奶不是教师)，领退休金，大概总共领了十几二十万，算对我们家有恩。我奶奶在这个长辈被抓的时候借钱给他，后来他出来了。\n我父亲有啥话都和他说。这个长辈说话建议啥的对我很不客气，并且很会煽动人的情绪。我父亲被他影响很大。我也和他聊过几次。他说过：1. 找个老婆有那么难吗？！我现在随时都可以约一个出来你信吗？他 60 多了 2. 你平时要主动点，大胆点，不要怕羞。3. 你多约约人家出来！别人要求很高吗？！难道她要香港的？！（男朋友）我说：有可能哦。4. 不是人家不好，多想想自己的原因，多练练口才。是你沟女不行，是你自己不够优秀！别人怎么能找到，比你差的都有人找两三个老婆。\n我父亲会对我说，xx 伯说你在北京那么远，有可能会嫁出去啵。回广东吧！（讽刺我会给别人当上门女婿）。\n我爸这个人内向，口才不好，情商特别低，但脾气特别暴躁。特别是对爷爷，对奶奶。奶奶特别强势压制父亲特别厉害，父亲是独子，看得出来奶奶很爱父亲，父亲也很爱奶奶，同时父亲也恨奶奶，她太强势了。爷爷年轻的时候不怎么管家里，爷爷以前当兵的在县城有单位。奶奶一个人在家带 4 个孩子，爷爷不怎么管。\n父亲的工作很辛苦，做大理石的。23 年一线工人，也修点电路，电动机。大理石要切割（粉尘特别多），噪音，搬动。哎～ 20 多年干苦力活太辛苦了\n我父亲他特别好面子，他以为他在村里形象挺好的，别人都挺尊敬他。其实他的形象挺差的。有一次父亲去赌，我母亲在家哭，母亲也是挺犟脾气的，在家越想越憋屈（父亲每次赌母亲就说自己的辛苦钱去送给别人），在生闷气。后来忍不了直接去摔麻将。过年期间全村人都知道了。\n后来我分析，为什么父亲过年会想去赌。他其实挺孤独的挺苦的，经常 11 点半多,12 点才睡，他焦虑孤独睡不着阿。平时没什么朋友聊天。好不容易过年，儿时的玩伴都回来了，当然要去玩了，放松一下，和别人聊聊天，社交一下。重要的是别人会说好听的话，他会想听到他想听的话。毕竟财神爷送钱谁不喜欢。还有有些别人讽刺他的话他也听不懂以为别人夸他呢。还挺开心的。\n有一次我父亲去喝完别人喜酒。别人说：一哥张家就差你一个了啵，儿子啥时候结婚阿？你儿子有没有聊女朋友？再不结婚就迟了哟！我父亲听了这些话就很慌，是天塌下来的那种。他最听不了这些话，每次慌了就打电话过来训我，怪我没用给他丢脸。村里有的人会故意刺激他，他都是照单全收，他每次都焦虑得要死，就打电话训我。训得多了，他说：和我说话你老是嗯嗯嗯的，会不会说话！你和女孩子也是这样说话的是吧！那把嘴能不能学好点得不得！学精明点得不得！整天脑子里面是什么！装的是水吗！整天没精神的样子学阳光点会死阿！整个番薯一样！你有脑的吗！（以前语气都是像喊贼那么大声）。你那双眼看上天，眼睛长在头顶！别那么清高得不得！别人一层楼的都取了二，三个了！\n以前他说到难听的话我忍着，不和他争辩，毕竟他是父亲。后来我回击了，是狠狠的回击了。他骂我：脑子是不是有问题！你是男人吗！有卵蛋吗！你那方面是不是有问题！有空去医院看看吧！我回应也很激烈！那一次我们歇斯底里！\n后来我们很久没有说话。前不久我们又大吵一架，歇斯底里的那种！\n在我的世界观里，对于讽刺自己的人（例如亲戚），占自己便宜的人（例如同事叫帮带早餐不给钱），同属岗位的同事挖坑。这些人 1.：远离。2.：警戒不要太给面子。3.敌人。现在选项 1 行不通。不是选项 3 毕竟是父亲。现在是选项 2 ，不给面子，能过过不过拉到，少接触，少聊天，有事帮，无事不接触。过年回家聚聚，能好好说话就聊。以前我老实在了，心想他是父亲要尊重他让他讲话，傻傻的听他训话，结果他越训越起劲，越难听，侮辱人。现在如果说话风向不对赶紧逃离，找借口挂电话。老了养他。\n最后想听听大家的建议。以后我该怎么办，怎么和父亲相处",

          "description": "概念\n首先给出一段由 ChatGPT 给出的简短的 AOP 概念：\nAOP 是一种编程方法，用来将在程序中多处重复出现的代码（比如日志、权限控制）从主要业务逻辑中抽取出来，提高代码的模块化和可维护性。\n抽取后的代码会在原始的业务逻辑代码中特定的位置执行，这些位置由切点（ Pointcut ）定义。通常会在方法执行前、执行后、抛出异常时等特定点执行抽取出的代码，这些点被称为连接点（ Join Point ）。\n概述\n在 C 语言中，编译器所提供的编译期和执行期的能力相较于 java 或者其他语言来说会弱一些，这也许就是可能很少听到在 C 语言中搞面向切面编程的原因之一吧。\n从上面的概念上来看，AOP 一般是在一些函数（或类方法）执行前后做一些额外处理，例如调用前增加一些权限控制，调用后增加一些日志记录。从这些行为上来说，任何语言其实都可以做到。我们可以简单的在一个函数的开始加一段逻辑或调用某个函数来实现权限验证，在函数返回前调用某个函数添加日志等等。类似如下代码：\nvoid foo(void)\n{\n  if (!verify_identity())\n    return;\n\n  //...\n  \n  log(\"end\");\n}\n\n但很显然，这么做会在程序的很多个函数中添加很多重复的代码（例如本例的verify_identity和log），以至于代码变得比较臃肿。\n那么有没有什么办法来瘦身呢？\n这就是 AOP 擅长的领域了。\n写在示例之前\nC 语言编译器没有提供很完整的 AOP 支持，因此我们需要自行手动实现，或者使用一些现有的库来实现。\n本文将使用开源 C 语言库 Melon 的函数模板来实现上面的效果。\n在 Melon 提供的函数模板组件中，实现了若干宏函数，这些宏函数都是用来定义不同类型的函数的。这些用宏来定义的函数和我们原生 C 语言中的函数的区别，简单来说就是，在我们…",

The Varieties of Religious Experience\n8.

          "description": "19 年买的 S10e 用到了现在，过年右下角屏幕磕碎了一些，电池也不太行了，另外或许是因为几年前换屏幕时后盖用的胶不行，现在后盖全靠一点点微弱的粘性挂在那里。终于有了换机的理由，勉强还是算个数码爱好者的，对于这些年新出的手机都没啥兴趣，中途买过一个红魔手机玩游戏，不是主力机，不过大概不到一年就卖了。\n最喜欢小屏旗舰弧面屏幕单手握持的感觉，所以 S10e 当时出来的时候就很喜欢，除了右上角挖孔有点难受 😂 前两天看到个评论说 S10e 跟 S10 握持手感差别不大，顺便看了一下参数，确实如此，那这次可以换个 S10e/S10 都可以。\n现在去淘宝京东搜 S10e/S10 都还能搜出来说是全新未拆封的，真的有点离谱。先是在淘宝买了个号称全新的 S10e ，结果到手问题不少，IMEI 和 SN 都对不上，还是网上搜出来对应的正确 SN 才知道也是 19 年激活的，这都可以忍的其实，后来我去了保护壳发现屏幕手感严重失真，左右滑一点都不丝滑，另外音量键也是极度疲软，这两点都不如我已经用了五年的 S10e ，真的离谱，之后便是退货了。\n后来又在京东国际上找到个号称全新的国行 S10 8+512 的，从香港发货，等了好几天。最后发现 IMEI 和 SN 在\n- https://support-cn.samsung.com/supportcn/imei/default.aspx\n- https://www.shkad.com.hk/default_cn.aspx\n都用不了，最后在艾优查询查到经销商是 BROADWAY PHOTO SUPPLY LTD. 香港百老汇？除了国行好像其他版本都没有查询激活时间的渠道了，也是有点奇怪。不过 IMEI 和 SN 看起来是对上的，综合下来这大概是一台最初是由香港百老汇售出的翻新港版二手 S10 😦 但是刷了国行系统。毕竟真要原装也不可能开机安卓 12 One UI 4.1 啊。\n折腾也是要时间精力的，累了，标价 2.8k 到手 2.3k 比起其他同样的应该都是翻新机的价格来说确实是贵了些，不过目前看起来质量还不错，另外不知道包含了多少关税？先用着吧，继续等下一个中意的手机，不行就看什么时候再搞个 S10e/S10 以防万一 😂 也想过直接买二手的，不过想买的基本成色太拉或者没有想要的版本，绝了。\n最后，我是刚才才发现原来我原来的 S10e 6+128 是有 4G RAM Plus （这就是虚拟内存吧？）这个所谓的 S10 8+512 也有 4G RAM Plus 😒 很难绷得住。",

          "description": "周末想用最近学的 Rust 来练手一下，于是参考一个很古老的 C 语言实现的端口敲门程序 knock，用 Rust 实现了一个版本。\n\nPort Knocking 是一种网络安全技术，通过对服务器上的一系列预定义端口进行特定顺序的“敲门”(即发送数据包)来触发服务器上的一种反应，通常是打开一个原本关闭的端口，从而允许发起敲门序列的客户端建立连接。这种方法的优点在于，对外界而言，受保护的服务端口在没有接收到正确的敲门序列之前都是不可见的，从而增加了系统的安全性。\n这个工具分为客户端和服务器端两部分：\n服务器端 (knockd): 在服务器上运行，负责监听预设的一系列端口上的敲门尝试。当它检测到来自同一 IP 的特定序列时，会执行配置文件中定义的命令，如修改防火墙规则来允许来自该 IP 的连接。\n客户端 (knock-cli): 用于发起敲门序列。用户可以通过客户端配置文件指定目标服务器地址和敲门的端口序列。执行敲门动作后，如果服务器端正确识别了敲门序列，客户端的 IP 地址将被允许访问原本隐藏或受限的服务。\n项目地址： https://github.com/TimothyYe/knock\n欢迎 Star 和贡献 Pull Request.",

          "description": "[背景] 大环境不好应该已经是一个人尽皆知的事情了\n原来的公司一直没有解决盈利的问题，最终在年底前开始了一波又一波的裁员。\n我呢，凭借着多年的努力工作和领导对我的认可苟到了决赛圈，但是随之而来的是各种绩效考核加降薪措施搞得我心力憔悴，在头秃与秃头之间，无奈主动跳入毒圈，成为了一名光荣的自由职业者。\n[焦虑与方向] 人生的十字路口，没有人可以帮你\n之前的日子我还可以骗骗自己，下个月还有工资可以领，可以安心的打打游戏，刷刷剧。\n可是从拿到离职证明的那一刻起，每个月卡里到点打钱的日子就和我没了关系。\n焦虑、迷茫、不安的情绪时刻萦绕在我的心里。\n接下啦的路，我该怎么走？\n[作出选择] 扣问本心，致良知\n那段时间，我总是在反复的想，在权衡，究竟怎样的选择才是对的，是正确的。\n感谢大数据，在我最迷茫的时候看到了一篇讲解王阳明心学的视频，“致良知”，去追问自己内心的真实想法：\n1 ）继续打工，可能会找到下一份工作，会有一段持续的收入，但是作为一名程序员，35 岁危机仍不可避免，ai 领域的极速发展，再加上现在乌央乌央的人进入程序猿这个行业，更廉价，更年轻的人无疑才是老板们的最优选择，我可以打工的时间，并没有那么多。\n2 ）寻找远程和接单机会。这条路，充满了未知和不确定性，但是如果可以坚持下来，它的生命周期将会伴随我很长很长一段时间。\n虽然当下会很难受，但是人总要突破自己的舒适圈才能成长。\n所以，我选择了第二条路。\n[就是干] 实践，知行合一\n明确了方向，接下来就是闷头干了。\n在离职后的第一个月，我把自己的技术重写梳理巩固了一遍，5 年的前端开发经历，得益于技术的发展，前端也可以独立完成整个产品的开发流程，技术上没问题，接下来就是整理项目案例和去寻找接单项目了。\n[接单] 你只管努力，剩下的交给老天\n非常幸运在我离职后的一个半月左右的时间，就有一位客户打电话给我，说是要做一款定制开发小程序（期间也接到过多个电话，但靠谱的不多）。\n在我们约定了见面并洽谈之后，我们敲定了合同，确定了开发工期，在收到首付款后，我就进入到了项目开发中去，项目工期一个半月，小程序+后台管理系统+api 接口开发，终于在前几天顺利完成了项目的交付。\n[前行] 天行健，君子以自强不息\n有时候，我也会在想，我做出的选择，是否正确？\n但是想想我从离职到现在的三个月，从客户对接到项目保障，从如何寻找客源到如何签订合同，保障双方利益，每一段经历都要比我之前的 5 年开发要精彩丰富，虽然前路仍未可知，但在人生这个尺度上，我比之前的自己，又进步了一些，那对我来说，这就是正确的事了。\n这就是我离职后三个月的一个分享，后续，我也会把我的一些接单过程和日常唠叨发出来，如果有在从事或想要从事全职接单这件事的朋友，也欢迎与我联系，在通往未知的道路上，让我们一起互帮互助，携手同行。\n[另] 打个小广告\n如果有小程序开发、app 开发、网站建设等软件开发需求，可以联系我，预算不高我这边可独立开发，项目较大的话我这边也有熟知的朋友可以团队协作。\n电话：15803406083",

          "description": "可能都是比较基础的问题，因为接触的时间不久，用词可能不太专业。我的云服务器是 debian12 ，装了 3 个服务，第一个是 frps ，代理家里 nas 的 jellyfin ，端口 8096 。第二个是个聊天服务，在 3000 端口。第三个是 docker 版的 nginxproxymanager 。用 nginx 反代前两个服务，设置了通信规则，可以用域名访问了。（我一开始以为所有服务都可以通过 https 来访问，就不用暴露服务本身的端口，结果用禁用端口后都没法访问了。。。囧）\n有几个问题需要请教：\n1.现在除了域名，也可以用 http://ip:端口的形式来访问服务，这样的话设置的通信规则就不起作用了，就觉得好别扭和奇怪。我想问能否禁用掉 ip+端口（ http ）的形式，只通过域名（ https ）访问，是要在高级规则里设置吗？我设置了一下发现命令是写在一个 server 块里的，没办法分开监听 80 和 443 ，不知道怎么搞。\n2.第二个聊天服务可以设置监听 0.0.0.0：3000 或 127.0.0.1：3000 ，设置成前者正常访问没问题。然后我想不暴露端口，就设置成后者，查了文档，转发主机/ip 那里填了 host.docker.internal ，但是无法访问，502 。我用 ssh 的端口转发看是没问题的，就是说 nginxproxymanager 没办法代理宿主机的服务吗？\n3.如果我暴露较少的端口，用 nginxproxymanager 能做到吗？还是说尽量用 docker 来搭建服务？有没有更好的方法？\n希望各位大佬能指点一下",

          "description": "先简单介绍下自己，程序员出身，之前的经验一直在广告平台做技术，最近几年做的是广告聚合平台，帮出海做流量变现的开发者做广告变现方案。正是这段经历，让我意识到以聚合为一个主方向，绝对有很多东西可以做，而且可以通过聚合发挥好平台的优势，让一个产品可以更好的辅助我们的用户，去提升用户的价值。\n   在 AI 这个大方向中，已经有很多聚合类产品，包括 AI 导航站、GPTs 导航站、AI 对话聚合站，但是 AI 绘画相关的聚合站会少一些，所以我们正是沿着这个思路，今年 1 月份正式开始了我们的 AI 绘画聚合小工具。因为是小团队，而且在出海网站这块的经验也比较欠缺，所以在踩了一堆坑之后，今天终于可以上线了，这是我们的网站地址： https://aiimagegenerator.artiversehub.ai ， 主要聚合的平台是：\n1. 支持 OpenAI 的 DALLE2 、DALLE3：号称最强 AI 绘画产品，也是目前普遍文生图的最贵的模型\n2. 支持 Leonardo.ai：目前在 AI 绘画中效果也别具风格\n3. 支持 Stability.ai：Stable Diffusion 背后的公司，目前提供的模型是最便宜的\n同时，我们也在尝试各种不同风格的 Prompt 生图，给用户带来作为参考，让 AI 绘画的门槛进一步降低。\n简单提供 2 个 Prompt 及不同模型的效果，给大家作为参考：\nPrompt:A modern interpretation of the Lantern Festival, a city square transformed by a contemporary art installation featuring high-tech lanterns. These lanterns are interactive, changing colors and patterns in response to the movements of passersby, blending traditional artistry with modern technology.\n![DALLE3]( https://img.artiversehub.ai/2024/02/23/a57125ba73d445949787340168219cbc.webp)\nPrompt: A city square with lanterns hanging in the sky. These lanterns are interactive, changing colors and patterns in response to the movements of passersby.\n![LEONARDO.AI]( https://img.artiversehub.ai/2024/02/23/c15f1f8ea4164244baaa61a36ff47bdf.jpg)\n新产品可能存在一些不太稳定的问题，我们也在持续优化中，新用户会赠送免费体验代币，欢迎大家体验，链接地址： https://aiimagegenerator.artiversehub.ai",

          "description": "OP 目前帝都某 985 博二在读，传统工科，我是研二走的硕博连读，当时竞争非常激烈，大概是 13 进 3 。我们课题组那一届有 3 个硕士想转博，老师把他唯一的名额给了我，刚转上时候还是挺高兴的，这是起点。\n我的方向是传统工科与深度学习相结合的方向，与组里的方向都格格不入，属于是没人指导，没人请教的状态。研一研二时候非常拼命，经常加班到晚上三点多，得益于前期投入，后面陆陆续续发了三篇 SCI 。\n博一时候老师叫我过去谈话，说发完三篇你就可以毕业了（我们系一般是发两篇就可以毕业了，很多是两篇毕业的状态），博二时又改口，说我做的不够深入，这点东西没办法写博士论文，搞的我每天都很焦虑。后面又给我定了一个巨难的方面，做了半年了，进展很小。\n博二时候（前几个月）又给我接了一个项目，20 个月周期，不做项目还好，一做项目完全没时间搞其他的了，今天大年 29 让我改 ppt ，我从初一到初五写了一个 5w 字报告+一份 ppt ，我当时还在我女朋友（已经扯证了）那里，我们异地恋，一年就见两次（寒假和暑假），本来指望寒假出去玩玩，结果我大年初六就被喊过去处理那个破项目。\n最近感觉一大堆问题，毕业问题，项目的事，还有以后工作的事。我女朋友那边没有我适合工作，她已经公务员上岸了，岳父也给买了房车，我现在只能迁就这她那边了。入职那边高校目前看也没戏（没有出国经历）。唉，感觉很难办。\n最近身体也出了问题，由于每天都坐着敲代码，一干就是一天，身体经常很疲惫，腰酸背痛，痔疮又犯了，都是泪。经常想着赶紧毕业，回家躺平，经常刷帖子，真羡慕那些干自由职业的或者独立开发者。至少可以自己支配时间，我在这里上学完全是当孙子来了，老师随叫随到，经常半夜发消息，改 ppt ，写本子。\n写的比较乱，全当吐槽了。",

Sora 介绍\n作为 OpenAI 首个文生视频模型，Sora 出道即王炸，生成的视频展现出了高级的摄影艺术、复杂的多角度镜头、逼真的情绪捕捉以及精确的物理模拟。毫无疑问，Sora 将对短视频、广告视频、动画短片、特效影视等视频行业产生巨大影响。\nSora 产品主页： https://openai.com/sora\nSora 技术报告： https://openai.com/research/video-generation-models-as-world-simulators\n从文本生成模型 GPT ，到文生图模型 DALL·E ，再到文生视频模型 Sora ，OpenAI 的技术迭代不禁让人感慨：\n或许，能打败 OpenAI 的只有 OpenAI 吧。\n目前，OpenAI 并没有开放 Sora 使用。不过，参考之前文生图模型 DALL·E 的经验，Sora 肯定只会开放给 ChatGPT Plus 用户使用。如果需要升级 ChatGPT Plus ，可以参考这篇文章：一分钟升级 ChatGPT Plus 教程。\n2. Sora 文生视频案例\nSora 不仅能够在视频主体暂时离开镜头时保持故事线的流畅，还能确保视频内容的真实性和逻辑性，不让任何细节显得突兀或者不自然。下面是 OpenAI 官方给出的案例：\nPrompt: A stylish woman walks down a Tokyo street filled with warm glowing neon and animated city signage.

          "description": "2024 ，第八周，0219-0225\n这周前两天做了一点点兼职的工作，剩下的五天都在暴走，每天步数陡然增高，结果就是每天脚底板都疼得要死。\n\n十年前的记忆\n周三周四两天在北京，晚上分别吃了小吊梨汤和南京大排档。\n上次吃小吊梨汤还是十年前，就是研究生毕业的那一天，参加完毕业典礼后，同学请我吃了一顿。\n\n这次是一家三口，点了一大桌子，吃得是很爽，但是剩下很多。\n\n上次吃南京大排档也是十年前了（好像是十一年前了），就在新中关那里，这次是在悠唐，又是一大桌子，但是只花了 158 ，简直不敢相信。\n\n天津之旅\n这个寒假本来是计划去上海及其周边旅游的，但是计划有变就取消了。眼看着寒假即将结束，就选择了离北京非常近的天津作为寒假之旅的目的地。\n之前我从未去过天津，也从未去过北京南站，令我震惊的是北京和天津之间的高铁车次也太多了，几乎是每隔三分钟就有一个车次，而且全程只需要半小时。\n这次我住的酒店就在津湾广场地铁站旁边，出了地铁站还有个 7-11 ，坐地铁去各个地方都非常方便。\n五大道\n入住酒店后，放下行李就直奔五大道。原谅我才疏学浅，整个五大道涉及的名人我几乎一个都没听过。\n孩子对马车十分向往，虽然很贵，虽然网上的人都说不值，但还是坐了。马车行进过程中，路人纷纷拿起手机拍我们的时候，有那么一丢丢优越感。\n坐完马车，又坐了一遍观光三轮车\n在民园第一次吃天津正宗的煎饼果子，果然吃不惯，感觉还不如家里的好吃\n\n西北角\n周六早上坐地铁去西北角，结果很失望，因为人太多了，天还冷，根本排不起队伍。只买了队伍最短的三个东西，面茶、糖果子、牛肚，还买了个冰箱贴纪念品。\n\n古文化街&意式风情区\n从西北角出来，直接打车到古文化街。这个古文化街还是个 5A 景区，但是我看就是各个旅游城市都有的购物一条街。相声没听，天后宫没进去，就吃了一顿狗不理包子，点完才发现这包子居然是速冻的……\n然后做了个观光三轮车去到了意式风情区。除去人多垃圾多的状况，这里还真和电影里看到的意大利小广场一模一样。坐了观光巴士把这一片周边的著名景点都走马观花看了一遍，iPhone 15 Pro Max 的 5 倍变焦太给力了。\n不得不吐槽一下，意式风情区的公厕太少太隐蔽了，连星巴克里面都没有，不像古文化街，走一段就有一个公厕。\n\n鼓楼灯会\n周六正值正月十五，听说天津的鼓楼灯会还不错，就提前买好了票，晚上坐地铁直接奔了过去。\n结果也是大失所望，根本原因就是人太多！多到人挨人人挤人的地步，什么古筝和舞狮表演根本看不到。而且提前买好的电子票也要换成纸质票才能进去……公厕极少，女厕排队特别长，还有人因为插队吵架。不过我今年一定行大运，肚子有感觉后就立刻往公厕赶，正好男厕进门后第一个坑位没人，危机顺利解除，再晚几秒钟后果不堪设想。\n因为人太多，就围着鼓楼四个面拍了四张照片就回去了，怕散场的时候连地铁都挤不上。\n\n返程\n周日早上返回北京，为了满足孩子，又又又去了一次北京动物园。因为去的时候将近中午，所有的动物都是无精打采的，熊猫、狮子、老虎都是躺着睡觉。\n\n从动物园出来，坐 6 号线，路过了东大桥，我毕业后第一份工作就在这里，也是十年前。看着一个个熟悉又陌生的站名，心里一阵唏嘘。奇怪的是，周日下午怎么 6 号线还是这么挤！！！\n\n为了满足老婆吃一顿日料大餐的愿望，在朝阳大悦城选了一个日料新店，此时的我们已经累到崩溃了，也没有人任何力气点菜了，就直接选了店里的一个四人套餐，虽然比较贵，但是实在是不想在花力气去翻菜单了。结果这个四人套餐，我们两大一小居然都吃光了……",

          "description": "前几天发了一个帖子： https://v2ex.com/t/1017718 ，\n询问搜狗和微信输入法哪个不耗电，经过我的测试，这两东西都比 rime 耗电，因为每次打字都会向腾讯服务器做请求\n花了 20 多分钟研究 rime ，自己从搜狗导入了词库后，发现 rime 和搜狗没什么区别，但耗电降低了太多。\n配置用的也是 v 站很多老哥们推荐的： https://github.com/ssnhd/rime ，微信输入法的主题，很好用。之所以推荐这个配置，是因为我自己用的小鹤双拼，一圈用下来，感觉这个配置用的最舒服，就是一键导入，什么都不用管了。平常做个备份和云同步就行。\n另外，rime 哪有那么麻烦，网上这么多配置直接用就行了，当初就是被无数人“科普” rime 上手很难吓到了，花 20 分钟（不懂的问 gpt ）研究的事情罢了。",

          "description": "国行版红米 K70 丐版，作为副机用了两个半月，写写使用感受。\n喜欢的地方\n主要是硬件性价比高\n便宜：上代旗舰 CPU 只要 2500 元，还要啥自行车。（阅读下文时请记住这点😂）\n性能强：上代旗舰跑绝大部分应用都没问题，而且 8gen2 没啥温控之类的硬伤。\n拍摄顺畅：相机普通模式连按快门很顺畅，没有感觉到卡顿。\n屏幕不错：基本的 HDR 视觉效果很好。阳光下激发亮度比较清晰。\n应用权限管理精细：权限管理比原生安卓（不加装模块的情况下）精细多了，限制后台应用以及防止全家桶互相唤醒也比原生系统激进得多，适合国内应用环境。\n晴雪比较好看：假如是光面，塑料感会很强。晴雪加了纹理后，视觉上比塑料好多了，不过不如磨砂玻璃。（虽然号称绒面质感玻璃，但我怎么看都像塑料...）\n不喜欢的地方\n好像几乎都是 HyperOS 的细节吐槽\n基本功能\n音量控制较差：一格太轻，两格太吵。音质渣。\n振动比较弱：这个看个人偏好，我是觉得太弱了，放口袋里几乎感觉不到。\n冬天指纹解锁成功率低：贴了钢化膜的情况下，在冬天又冷又干的环境，屏下光学指纹解锁成功率明显降低。暖一些、湿度正常的时候，指纹解锁没什么问题。\n主题界面\n桌面文件夹没有小四宫格：很奇怪，只有占 1×1 的小九宫格和占 2×2 的大四宫格、大九宫格，但没有占 1×1 的小四宫格，这就导致 3-4 个图标时非常尴尬。\n桌面布局只有 4×6, 5×6, 4×7 ，不知道为什么没有 5×7 。\n第三方应用无法分别设置桌面和锁屏壁纸：第三方相册应用只能同时设置桌面和锁屏壁纸，如果要设置不同图片则需要安装小米相册。\n短信通知下划会变小窗：新短信弹出的横幅通知，下划会变成独立小窗，我不太喜欢，但无法设置不显示小窗。\n刘海不平衡：K70 明明挺宽的，但摄像头左侧最多只能显示 3 个图标，空空荡荡。与此同时，摄像头右侧显示一堆图标，非常拥挤。\n系统及应用\n杀后台连 VPN 都不例外：从后台应用列表划走应用就强制结束运行，哪怕把 VPN 应用的省电策略设置为不限制也没用。用通知栏快捷开关是可以不出现在后台应用列表里，不过打开应用界面操作就出现在后台应用列表里了。但搞笑的是，有时从后台同时划走多个应用，VPN 应用有概率继续在后台运行。\n截图只能存 JPG：系统自带截图应用默认只能保存为 JPG 格式，无法保存为无损的 PNG 格式，没有设置选项。以前 MIUI 可以用 adb 禁用截图应用来 fallback 到原生系统截图功能，现在尝试 adb 禁用会提示系统应用无法禁用。\n下载管理烦人：下载管理 app 的通知无法关闭，下载完成有时会带一句“未启用迅雷加速”打广告。另外绿色的图标又丑又显眼。\n安全服务烦人：安全服务 app 的部分通知无法关闭，虽然安全类强制提示可以理解，但“垃圾清理”、“电池与省电的一般通知”也不能关闭就比较烦。另外绿色盾牌图标又丑又显眼。\nandroid/app 目录无法授权访问：正常来说应用访问 android/app 目录需要单独授予访问权限，但 Solid Explorer 文件管理器申请授权时，提示“为了保护您的隐私，请选择其他文件夹”，无法授权。\n默认应用商店无法更改：虽然安装 Google Play 很简单，但无法替换默认的小米商店，这就导致个别 Play 版应用调起内购时却调起小米商店，然后提示出错无法内购。\n涉及底层的应用可能不兼容：有些应用比如 Island(炼妖壶)会克隆不了工作资料分身，即使在开发者选项关了系统优化也不成功，感觉是调用应用包管理组件的问题。最后通过 adb 安装了工作资料应用。\n广告多：默认配置下广告真是铺天盖地，想得到想不到的地方都会出现广告，开关则散落在各处，要一个个去设置关闭，考验耐心和搜索能力。\n总结\n非常适合作为副机专门装国内应用。虽然上面吐槽了一大堆，但它便宜啊......",

          "description": "名字: Mindr\n开发者 / 团队: Florian Vates\n平台: iOS, iPadOS, Android 正在开发中\n请简要介绍下这款产品\n有没有发现自己总是不断推迟待办事项的通知？\nMindr 以一种全新的方法来解决这个问题，它直观的界面设计将待办事项的进度直接显示在桌面上，就像查看 Apple 的电池小组件一样，你只需要轻松一瞥便能知道剩余时间。\n\n给 Mindr 一个机会，它的效果会让你大吃一惊！\n哪个瞬间让你决定开发这款产品？\n在我意识到自己总是无限期推迟一些不会带来严重后果的任务，并且开始失去对它们逾期时间的跟踪时，忽然脑中灵光一闪——我发现传统的通知提醒对这类任务并不奏效，于是我决定打造一个更有效的解决方案。\n相比于同类产品，你觉得它有什么特别之处？\n大多数待办事项 App 都是在任务到期时提醒你，让你立刻去完成，但往往那并非是完成任务的最佳时机。与之不同，Mindr 采用视觉进度显示，让你对任务是否逾期以及逾期时长一目了然，从而激发你的紧迫感。\n你尝试过哪些渠道推广它？过程中有什么收获吗？\n目前我们主要通过公开产品构建的过程（ Build in Public ）进行推广，并与多家欣赏我们这种创新方式的科技媒体合作，他们对于我们在这个竞争激励的市场带来的新思路表示赞赏，并对 Mindr 进行了报道。\n发布这款产品至今，有哪些反馈让你印象深刻？\n让我感到非常开心的是，许多患有多动症（ ADHD ）的用户告诉我，这款 App 极大地帮助他们提高了对任务的专注度。因为他们能够持续地看到这些任务，并感受到紧迫感。看到我的产品能帮助他们解决最头痛的问题，真的让我感到欣慰。\n你是如何获取灵感，验证它的可行性，并投入开发和设计的？\n我有一份全职工作，还需要照顾家庭以及在教堂做义工，因此我的时间非常有限，就更不用说业余爱好了。虽然如此，我还是努力每天至少挤出一个小时来处理副业项目（ Side Projects ）。\n时间的宝贵让我必须高效地利用每一分钟，在 App 开发方面的经验帮助我在编程上节省了不少时间，因此优先级划分成为我工作的重点。我用 Sorted 3 快速记下突然冒出的任务和想法，之后再进行整理和优先排序。\n但我通常对此并不会过于严格，毕竟我还是想享受创作的乐趣。如果我暂时不想做某件事，我会根据实际情况进行调整。在广告公司超过 9 年的工作经验，让我学会了如何有效地区分轻重缓急。\n因此，我只开发那些能解决我个人问题的 App ，这也是我对市场验证不太苛刻的原因，因为这些 App 本来就是为了我自己而制作的。与此同时，这也让我对完成和完善这些 App 充满动力，这是一个意想不到的好处。\n在设计方面，我有自己坚持的风格，并尝试让它适用于其他 App 。我偶尔也会从 Dribbble 上寻找灵感，作为一名有近 10 年经验的 iOS 开发者，启动新项目对我来说已经驾轻就熟。\n有哪些产品你觉得应该被更多用户知道？\n除了前面提到的 Sorted 3 外，还有一个可能不太为人所知的 App 是 Rotato，我用它来制作应用功能的动画演示。另一个值得一提的是 Wishkit，它能够帮助收集用户的功能需求，这对于确定产品的优先级非常有帮助。虽然我已经构建了自己的一套系统，但对于那些不想自己动手的人来说，使用像 Wishkit 这样的服务是一个不错的选择。\n介绍一下你自己，以来未来的计划。\n我是一名全职爸爸，同时也是一家广告公司的全职软件开发人员，热衷于创造能以有趣且美好的方式改善人们生活的副业项目（ Side Projects ）。\n我之前开发的项目还包括一款记账 App MonAi，它利用 AI 将语音输入转变为交易记录，帮助用户以最简单的方式跟踪开支。\n未来，我计划推出更多的应用和服务，希望有一天能将此作为我的主要收入来源。\n关于 Apptisan\nApptisan 是 Application 与 Artisan 的组合词，意为「与应用背后的工匠交流」。\n每一期我会与来自不同地方的创作者交流，希望通过我们的对话来向更多的用户介绍有趣的产品。\n如果你倾向于英文阅读，欢迎通过 Substack 订阅。如果你想要自荐产品，请填写该 表格，我会尽快与你取得联系。",

          "description": "如题，之前在老家 gap 了一段时间，从毕业到 30 岁，这是我继大学后最快乐幸福的一段时光，没有楼上咚咚响的邻居，没有挤不上的地铁，没有开不完的周会评审会，没有定不完的 OKR ，没有 PUA 和占用周末的团建，日常就是刷剧打游戏，然后陪父母刷剧，有好看的新电影还会开车拉父母去县城看，看完再去火锅店搓一顿，更棒的是每个月支出居然只有 2~3k ，用现在的收入能够轻松应对 （目前月入：存款利息+其他收入+失业金=8k+，除了利息，其他两项都不长久）。\n这让我再次思考，我这样性格的人想要的到底是什么样的生活，其实我现在很想回老家，探索下如何做远程工作之类的，做个数字游民，但苦于不知道如何布局，有没有情况类似的 V 友？回老家了吗？回去后从事些什么工作，是比之前在大城市时的精神状态好多了还是更累了？",

Yet most creators haven’t turned on paywall settings, so users only see a paywall after using up all their daily points.\nHow to set your paywall: From your public bot list, click into each bot, go to ‘Edit bot’ in ‘...’ on the bot details, and toggle on the “Maximum daily message limit”. We recommend starting with 10 messages per day, and adjusting up or down. Consider how many messages it will take to engage the user before displaying the paywall so they’re most likely to subscribe.\nShare to earn: As always, sharing your bots with your personal network and across social media goes a long way in helping drive engagement and increasing your chances to earn. Poe also has an official Discord channel specifically to highlight your amazing creations: #showcase.\nPer-message earnings coming soon: With the recent addition of compute points, we’re closer to introducing a way to earn from each message your bot sends in response to a user. We will share more details soon.\n\nAs the heartbeat of the Poe community, we’re proud to support and reward creators like you for creating and sharing such a diverse mix of bots for users to engage with.",

          "description": "3月13日消息，一家初创公司Cognition近日推出了一款名为Devin的人工智能助手，旨在协助软件工程团队完成编码和其他开发任务。与现有AI编码助手不同，Devin可被编程执行端到端的软件项目，包括部署应用、修复Bug、学习新技术等，人类则扮演监督和指导角色。\n\r\n\r\nDevin能根据用户需求执行多步骤工作流程，同时保持工作正轨。工程师可实时观察其进度，发现错误时跳出指令进行修正。这使团队能将部分工作外包给AI助手，自己专注于更具创意的工作。\n\r\n\r\n根据演示，Devin可处理包括部署网站、调试代码、生成隐藏信息图像、训练计算机视觉模型在内的多种任务。在软件工程基准测试中，它能独立完成13.86%的案例，远高于其他大型语言模型。\n\r\n\r\n尽管核心技术细节未透露，但Cognition表示Devin源于其长期推理及规划研究的进展。目前该工具处于内测阶段，有意用户可申请提前试用。未来或将开放更广泛访问。\n\r\n\r\nCognition暗示编码只是开端，这意味着其人工智能助手或可推广至更多领域。该公司计划利用人工智能在跨领域的推理优势，探索为多个行业赋能。\n\r\n\r\nDevin的出现为软件开发人员带来全新的人工智能协作体验。通过监督AI系统处理繁琐工作，工程师能聚焦创新性任务，有望提高生产力。不过该技术依然处于早期，其成熟度和效果有待业界进一步评估。\n\r\n\r\n来源：凤凰网\n\r\n\r\n我觉得，如果Devin能够每天进行深度学习，那么以后真的就不需要人类程序员了。AI程序员又便宜，又好用，写的程序水平又高，价钱便宜，24小时工作，为什么不用啊。但问题是，当人类所有的程序都由AI控制，并且AI还会自我学习进化，那么AI觉醒之后，难道不会在程序里面“加点料”？",

          "description": "据路透社、美国《国会山报》等外媒报道，美东时间3月5日，美国国会两党议员提出新法案，要求字节跳动公司剥离对旗下短视频应用TikTok的控制权，并且要求在165天内完成，否则TikTok将面临被禁的风险。\n\r\n\r\nTikTok方面对此回应称：“无论提案人如何掩饰，这项法案都是一项彻头彻尾的TikTok封禁令。这项立法将践踏1.7亿美国人的第一修正案权利，剥夺平台上500万小企业赖以发展和创造就业的机会。”\n\r\n\r\n据了解，该项法案由众议院中国特设委员会主席麦克·加拉格尔（Mike Gallagher）和委员会首席民主党议员拉贾·克里希纳莫提（Raja Krishnamoorthi）为首的共19名议员提出，法案的核心内容是将禁止受到外国对手控制和影响的应用软件在美国运行，其中就明确点名了字节跳动和TikTok。该法案将给予字节跳动165天的时间进行剥离事项，否则TikTok将从美国的应用软件商店下架，同时还将停止网络托管服务，致其无法访问网站。\n\r\n\r\n另外，该项法案还赋予了总统新的权力，使其能够对总部或注册地位于某些国家的公司控制的社交媒体应用采取对应行动，如禁令或限制。这类应用如果要避免被禁的命运，除非能够通过出售股份等方式切断与受国外对手控制的实体公司间的联系，该法案要求国外对手实体公司不得拥有超过该公司20%占比的股权。\n\r\n\r\n对TikTok实行禁令等相关问题在过去几年频繁成为美国国会的聚焦关注点，并且多以对美国国家安全构成威胁为由召开听证会。最受关注的莫过于去年3月，TikTok CEO周受资出席了美国众议院能源与商务委员会听证会，接受美国两党议员针对TikTok用户隐私、数据安全以及未成年人安全等相关问题的质询。他在书面证词中强调，平台将通过防火墙保护美国用户数据，防止未经授权的外国访问；TikTok仍是一个可以自由表达的平台，不会受到任何政府的操纵。此次该项法案的提出被外界认为是国会在推动禁令的一波最新的努力和尝试。\n\r\n\r\n针对美国政府此前要求字节跳动出售其持有的TikTok股份否则将封禁App一事，商务部新闻发言人曾表示，无视产品和服务本身，仅从外国投资者的身份出发，强制要求出售TikTok，将严重损害包括中国在内的各国投资者赴美投资信心。如果该消息属实，中方将坚决反对出售或者剥离TikTok。涉及技术出口问题，必须按照中国的法律法规履行行政许可程序，中国政府将依法作出决定。\n\r\n\r\n此外，外交部发言人也表示：“我们一贯主张数据安全问题不应成为个别国家泛化国家安全概念、滥用国家力量、无理打压别国企业的工具，美方迄今未能拿出证据证明TikTok威胁美国国家安全。美方应当停止在数据安全问题上散布虚假信息，停止无理打压有关企业，为各国企业在美投资经营提供开放、公平、公正、非歧视的营商环境。”\n\r\n\r\n目前，TikTok是最受美国年轻群体欢迎的应用软件之一，就在上个月，美国总统拜登的连任竞选团队已经在TikTok上注册了账户，并发布了第一个包括总统问答环节在内的TikTok视频，该视频获得了超过1000万次的流量。但TikTok这一应用程序仍被禁止在政府设备上使用，目前，美国依然有几个州彻底或部分禁止在政府设备上使用TikTok。\n\r\n\r\n来源：南方都市报",

While-Else 结构\n在 Python 中， while 循环可以与 else 块配对。当且仅当循环正常完成时，else 块才会执行，这意味着它不会通过 break 语句终止。\n换句话说，如果 while 循环被 break 终止，则 else 块将不会被执行。\nleaders = [\"Elon\", \"Tim\", \"Warren\"]\ni = 0\nwhile i < len(leaders):\n    if leaders[i] == \"Yang\":\n        print(\"Yang is a leader!\")\n        break\n    i += 1\nelse:\n    print(\"Not found Yang!\")\n\n# Not found Yang!\n\n如上面的示例所示， while 循环迭代 leaders 列表，搜索领导者 \"Yang\"。不幸的是，\"Yang\" 并不是该名单中真正的领导者。所以 break 语句没有被执行。因此，else 语句下的代…",
