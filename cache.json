          "description": "Love is magic, it defies explanation. To the most rational and logical among us, this may be confusing. Its elusiveness is its significance. Love isn’t an illusion to be broken, but a miracle to bask in. Not everything needs to be understood to be appreciated. You are the audience, and the magician.\nLove is an idea. A moment of love can be forgotten but it can never be destroyed. It will be inscribed in time forever. Like an idea, love can exist long after death. Love lives simply by being conjured in the mind. Its abundance can be infinite.\nLove is a feeling, a swell of pure causality. It spawns cascades of events. You know it when you feel it. This feeling makes you think things, say things, do things, that otherwise would have never happened.\nLove is action. It is possible to convert irreplaceable resources into love. Time, will, energy — units of life. Every day you are given these raw elements to work with. These building blocks can be turned into an ethereal structure that is stronger, more solid, and more durable than any physical material.\nLove is freedom. It is unwise for trapeze artists to learn how to defy death without a safety net. Love gives you the freedom to explore the weirdest corners of your soul, your most peculiar ambitions. To love someone is to give them the freedom to become themselves, because they know you be there if they fall.\nLove is fear. The more you love someone, the more you may become afraid to lose them. But you must never let that fear stop you from loving someone as much as you possibly can.",

Neosync is an open source platform that helps developers anonymize production data, generate synthetic data and sync it across their environments for better testing, debugging and developer experience.\nMost developers and teams have some version of a database seed script that creates some mock data for their local and stage databases. The problem is that production data is messy and it’s very difficult to replicate that with mock data. This causes two big problems for developers.\nThe first problem is that features seem to work locally/stage but have bugs and edge cases in production because the seed data you used to develop against was not representative of production data.\n…",

However, property-based testing is not as widely used as in other languages such as Haskell or Elixir, and I think this is because there is no de facto testing tool.\nThis gem currently not only has the basic functionality of stateless property-based testing but also has the following features:\n- Support verbose mode that allows you to see its shrinking procedure and algorithms.\n- Support several concurrency/parallel executions of each test. As of now, Ractor/Thread/Process are available.

          "description": "I'm a game development hobbyist and I'd love to find a community similar to HN, where a mix of technology and industry-related news is shared and discussed. Does something like this exist? Any other communities or publications useful for someone interested in the gamedev space? Bonus points if they have \"Who is hiring\" type threads with actual participation from gamedevs, rather than the typical job listings that are outdated and opaque.\nThis was posted 2 years ago [1], and some good resources were shared there. Would love to know if there are any new spaces to check out in 2024.\n[1] https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=30993317\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40419289\nPoints: 30\n# Comments: 10",

          "description": "My cousin and I love the Terraforming Mars board game. But we'd often get overly excited and knock our pieces off of our boards, losing track of our progress. So I digitised it. It comes with a few cool features like resource conversions (e.g. converting plants to greenery), production phase, offline, mobile-friendly and keeps track of the history using the browser history itself. Sharing this here in case there are any other TM fans that could also find some use in this :)\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40406344\nPoints: 62\n# Comments: 36",

          "description": "Desktop Docs is a Mac app that lets you search all your photos and videos in seconds with AI.\nOnce you find the file you're looking for you can resize it, export it to Adobe Premiere Pro, or drag and drop it into another app.\nI built Desktop Docs because I keep tons of media files on my computer and I can never remember where I save stuff (lots of screenshots, memes, and downloads). The Apple Photos app also only supports photos in your iCloud.\nDesktop Docs supports adding folders or individual files to an AI Library where you can search by the contents of your files, not just file titles.\nYou can search by objects (\"cardboard box\"), actions (\"man smiling\", \"car driving\"), by emotion (\"surprised woman\", \"sad cowboy\"), or the text in the frame (great for screenshots or memes).\nIt's also 100% private. Make any media searchable without it ever leaving your computer.\nHow I built it:\n- 100% Javascript (I'm using Electron JS and React JS).\n- Embedding generation (CLIP from OpenAI is used to compute the image embeddings and text embeddings for user queries).\n- Redis (storing and doing KNN search on the embeddings with this DB).\n- Image/video editing (the app ships with FFmpeg binaries to explode videos into individual frames and scale images).\nDemo: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EIUgPNHOKKc\nIf there are any features you'd like to see in Desktop Docs or want to learn more about how I built it, drop me a comment below.

          "description": "Hey HN! I built a tool that gives LLMs the ability to understand the visual structure of a webpage even if they don't accept image input. We've found that unimodal GPT-4 + Tarsier's textual webpage representation consistently beats multimodal GPT-4V/4o + webpage screenshot by 10-20%, probably because multimodal LLMs still aren't as performant as they're hyped to be.\nOver the course of experimenting with pruned HTML, accessibility trees, and other perception systems for web agents, we've iterated on Tarsier's components to maximize downstream agent/codegen performance.\nHere's the Tarsier pipeline in a nutshell:\n1. tag interactable elements with IDs for the LLM to act upon & grab a full-sized webpage screenshot\n2. for text-only LLMs, run OCR on the screenshot & convert it to whitespace-structured text (this is the coolest part imo)\n3. map LLM intents back to actions on elements in the browser via an ID-to-XPath dict\nHumans interact with the web through visually-rendered pages, and agents should too. We run Tarsier in production for thousands of web data extraction agents a day at Reworkd (https://reworkd.ai).\nBy the way, we're hiring backend/infra engineers with experience in compute-intensive distributed systems!\nhttps://reworkd.ai/careers\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40369319\nPoints: 119\n# Comments: 47",

          "description": "We are building Quary (https://quary.dev), an engineer-first BI/analytics product. You can find our repo at https://github.com/quarylabs/quary and our website at https://www.quary.dev/. There’s a demo video here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3hO65_lkGU\nAs engineers who have worked on data at startups and Amazon, we were frustrated by self-serve BI  tools. They seemed dumbed down and they always required us to abandon our local dev tools we know and love (e.g. copilot, git). For us and for everyone we speak to, they end up being a mess.\nBased on this, we decided there was a need for engineer-oriented BI and analytics software.\nQuary solves these pain points by bringing standard software practices (version control, testing, refactoring, ci/cd, open-source, etc.) to the BI and analytics workflow.\nWe integrate with many databases, but we’re showcasing our slick Supabase integration, because it: (1) keeps your data safe by running on your machine without data flowing through our servers; and (2) enables you to quickly build an analytics layer on top of your Supabase Postgres instances. Check out our Supabase guide: https://www.quary.dev/docs/quickstart-supabase\nWhat we’re launching today is open source under the Apache 2.0 license. We plan to keep the developer core open source and add paid features like a web platform to easily share data models (per-seat pricing), and an orchestration engine to materialize your data models.\nPlease try Quary at https://quary.dev and let us know what you think! We're excited to put the power of BI and analytics into the hands of engineers.\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40367090\nPoints: 138\n# Comments: 34",

          "description": "I've been obsessed for the past ~year with the possibilities of talking to LLMs. I built a bunch of one-off prototypes, shared code on X, started a Meetup group in SF, and co-hosted a big hackathon. It turns out that there are a few low-level problems that everybody building conversational/real-time AI needs to solve on the way to building/shipping something that works well: low-latency media transport, echo cancellation, voice activity detection, phrase endpointing, pipelining data between models/services, handling voice interruptions, swapping out different models/services.\nOn the theory that something like a LlamaIndex or LangChain for real-time/conversational AI would be useful, a few of us started working on a Python library for voice (and multimodal) AI assistants/agents.\nSo ... Pipecat: a framework for building things like personal coaches, meeting assistants, story-telling toys for kids, customer support bots, virtual friends, and snarky social bots.\nMost of the core contributors to Pipecat so far work together at our day jobs. This has been a kind of \"20% time\" thing at our company. But we're serious about welcoming all contributions. We want Pipecat to support any and all models, services, transport layers, and infrastructure tooling. If you're interested in this stuff, please check it out and let us know what you think. Submit PRs. Become a maintainer. Join the Discord. Post cool stuff. Post funny stuff when your voice agent goes completely off the rails (as mine sometimes do).\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40345696\nPoints: 157\n# Comments: 23",

          "description": "Hi HN! I thought you might enjoy this even if you don't know much about Elixir.\n`es6_maps` is a small library that introduces a \"shorthand\" map creation syntax, similar to shorthand object construction in JavaScript/TypeScript. For those unfamiliar with Elixir, the most interesting aspect might be how it achieves this. `es6_maps` takes advantage of BEAM (Erlang's VM) hot-reload capabilities to amend the Elixir compiler bytecode at runtime, adding functions that expand the shorthand syntax for further compilation. I think it's a nice showcase of the power you can wield (with care) when writing in BEAM languages.\nLet me know what you think!\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40333500\nPoints: 56\n# Comments: 29",

The rationale behind it is while wireguard is a fantastic protocol cryptographically it leaves a lot to be desired when it comes to enrollment and end user device security.\nObviously instead of using an off the shelf solution like tailscale, I decided to reinvent the wheel which has honestly been quite fun with learning about eBPF, and recently clustering and HA with etcd!\nThe most recent version (in the docker container) contains about 6 months of very new work bringing it all from sqlite3 to etcd. So please be forgiving if it does some weird things!\nHope you all enjoy!\nP.s Im not a web developer and any tips on that front to make it less teeth pullingly awful are welcome!\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40326615\nPoints: 106\n# Comments: 29",

Here’s a demo video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ls6VRzBQ-pQ.\nSnowflake is one of the most widely used data warehouses today. It abstracts out the underlying compute infrastructure into “warehouses” for the user - compute units with t-shirt sizes (X-Small, Small, Medium etc.). In general, if you want to lower your data processing costs, the only thing you can do is to just process less data (i.e. query optimization). But Snowflake’s warehouse abstraction allows an extra dimension along which you can optimize - by minimizing the compute you need to process that same data (i.e. warehouse optimization). Baselit automates Snowflake warehouse optimization for you.\nWhile we were working on anot…",

We spent the past 7 months building a solid experience to replicate data from Postgres to data warehouses. Now we're expanding to queues.\nPeerDB Streams provides a simple and native way to replicate changes as they happen in Postgres to Queues (Kafka, Redpanda, Google PubSub, etc). We use Postgres logical decoding to enable Change Data Capture (CDC).\nBlog post here: https://blog.peerdb.io/peerdb-streams-simple-native-postgres.... 10-min quickstart here: https://docs.peerdb.io/quickstart/streams-quickstart.\nWe chose queues as many users found that existing tools are complex. Debezium is the most used tool for this use-case. It has large production usage. However, a common pain point among …",

          "description": "I’ve loved keeping plants since I was a kid. But the online world of plants can be confusing - strange vocabulary, plants going by conflicting names, and hundreds of niche websites. I wanted to create a site that would organize all of this info and make it easier to explore and discover new plants. That’s why I created GetAnyPlant, which aggregates and matches plants from dozens of online stores. It includes huge amounts of data on these plants along with filters and categories to help you search. You can also save plants to your wishlist and add notes to them.\nI’m a data scientist by profession, so probably 80% of the work was totally new to me. I built v1 using wordpress , v2 using django, and v3 I pivoted to using react and next js for frontend.\nI would greatly appreciate any feedback on the site as well as any advice on how to grow it.\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40273470\nPoints: 285\n# Comments: 94",

          "description": "A (lengthy!) tutorial on how to write your own JS-based autopilot code to fly planes in Microsoft Flight Simulator with a web page to both visualize the flight and control the AP.\nNote that this is a complete do-over of a previous page that used a combination of Python and JavaScript, and only covered basic autopilot functionality. This rewrite threw all of that out, and goes much, much further:\nyou just want to have the plane take off without having to do anything? Check, this tutorial covers auto-takeoff.\nFlying with waypoint-based navigation, not by \"programming airports and radio beacons one letter at a time with a jog-dial\" but by just placing markers on a map and dragging those around as you please, mid-flight, Google Maps style? Check. After all, why would we not, putting a map on a webpage is super easy (barely an inconvenience).\nIn fact, let's throw in flight plan saving and loading, so others can fly the same route!\nAnd maybe you want the plane to fly a fixed distance above the ground, instead of at a fixed altitude... well: check. You'll learn about terrain-follow using free Digital Elevation Model datasets for planet Earth.\nAnd of course the big one, for the ultimate \"click button, JS flies the plane start to finish\" experience: ever wished the in-game autopilot could just land the plane for you? Well, it's a video game, and we know programming, so: why not? We're also implementing auto-landing and it's going to be amazing.\nIf you play MSFS, and you're a developer/programmer, and you've always thought how cool it would be if you could just do some scripting for it... you can, there's a lot of cool stuff you can do!\nAnd of course if you don't want to follow along and just want to have everything set up and ready to fly your plane, just clone https://github.com/Pomax/are-we-flying and have fun.\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40267164\nPoints: 61\n# Comments: 11",

          "description": "Hi HN!\nI'm Jonathan and I built Hacker Search (https://hackersearch.net), a semantic search engine for Hacker News. Type a keyword or a description of what you're interested in, and you'll get top links from HN surfaced to you along with brief summaries.\nUnlike HN's otherwise very valuable search feature, Hacker Search doesn't require you to get your keywords exactly right. That's achieved by leveraging OpenAI's latest embedding models alongside more traditional indexes extracted from the scraped and cleaned up contents of the links.\nI think there are many more interesting things one could build atop the HN dataset in the age of LLMs (e.g. more explicitly searching for technical opinions, recommending stories to you based on your interests, and making the core search feature more useful). If any of those sound interesting to you, head over to https://hackersearch.net/signup to get notified when I launch them!\nNote: at least one person has built something similar before (https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36391655). Funnily enough, I only found out about this through my own implementation, and I based on my testing, I think Hacker Search generally performs better when doing keyword/sentence searches (vs. whole document similarity lookup), thanks to the way the data is indexed.\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40238509\nPoints: 138\n# Comments: 57",

My name is Andrew, and I'm thrilled to share with you a project I've been working on called Factful.\nI'm a high school student with a passion for tackling misinformation online. Inspired by the need for more reliable content verification tools, I decided to create Factful. It's an AI-powered web app designed to revolutionize how individuals and organizations verify content.\nUnlike traditional grammar checkers, Factful provides a comprehensive analysis that goes beyond just grammar. It evaluates context, factuality, coherence, and more to ensure the accuracy and credibility of content.\nI believe that in today's information age, it's more crucial than ever to have tools like Factful to combat misinformation and promote content integrity. I'm excited to continue developing Factful and would love for you to check it out. Your feedback and support would mean the world to me. Thanks for taking the time to read about Factful, and please go check out our beta deployment of Factful (a little beyond the MVP) for free on our website!\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40222051\nPoints: 111\n# Comments: 81",

          "description": "Reduce your cloud costs - SREs/DevOps/Cloud Engineers\nHi community!\nWe are Kaytu (“Kay-two,” named after the K2 mountain), and we've developed an open-source tool for engineering, DevOps, and SRE teams to reduce cloud costs.\nCloud inflation (“cloud-flation”) is real—AWS EC2 costs are up 23% (4-5x global inflation average [1]), and 30% of the capacity that is paid for is simply wasted ([2]).\nThe best way to improve cloud utilization is by simplifying the process so engineers can spot inefficiencies and suggest changes. We built a simple open-source CLI tool that recommends a cost-optimal workload based on actual usage data from observability tools. Check it out at https://github.com/kaytu-io/kaytu   \nCurrently, we support AWS EC2 On-Demand Servers & EBS Storage using observability data from…",

          "description": "Hey HN, exciting news! Our RAG framework, Cognita (https://github.com/truefoundry/cognita), born from collaborations with diverse enterprises, is now open-source. Currently, it offers seamless integrations with Qdrant and SingleStore.\nIn recent weeks, numerous engineers have explored Cognita, providing invaluable insights and feedback. We deeply appreciate your input and encourage ongoing dialogue (share your thoughts in the comments – let's keep this ‘open source’).\nWhile RAG is undoubtedly powerful, the process of building a functional application with it can feel overwhelming. From selecting the right AI models to organizing data effectively, there's a lot to navigate. While tools like LangChain and LlamaIndex simplify prototyping, an accessible, ready-to-use open-source RAG template with modular support is still missing. That's where Cognita comes in.\nKey benefits of Cognita:\n1. Central repository for parsers, loaders, embedders, and retrievers.\n2. User-friendly UI empowers non-technical users to upload documents and engage in Q&A.\n3. Fully API-driven for seamless integration with other systems.\nWe invite you to explore Cognita and share your feedback as we refine and expand its capabilities. Interested in contributing? Join the journey at https://www.truefoundry.com/cognita-launch.\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40181306\nPoints: 61\n# Comments: 5",

          "description": "For the last few years, I've been working at a non-profit called Hack Club developing tools to support self-motivated teens to learn about technology and build community with other like-minded peers while doing so.\nThis has resulted in the development of a model called \"you ship, we ship.\" We build open source creative coding environments, and when teenagers share the projects they make with these tools, we send them materials to dive deeper into the subject and related technologies. Our approach is predicated on the constructionist idea that people learn best by building things they care about and sharing them with others. The vision we have is to create a public collection of creative learning tools that offer people projects they can do right away and communities of practice to engage with.\nBlot is our next installment in the series. It's designed to be a gateway to CNC robotics through digital art. If you'd like to see some of the projects people have made so far, you can check out:\nhttps://blot.hackclub.com/gallery\nYou can also find projects from our first \"you ship, we ship\" called Sprig. It's a game console you get by building a game for it.\nhttps://sprig.hackclub.com/gallery\nI'd love people's thoughts on the model and ideas for other subjects in technology we could build projects around.\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40180475\nPoints: 25\n# Comments: 8",

This year-long undertaking follows the completed Nand to Tetris course, but ported to the web with its own runtime, user interface, and IDE. Using the \"Load example program\" selector, you can try out some programs I wrote on NAND's emulated hardware such as 2048, a genetic algorithm, and a manual stack overflow to corrupt the screen.\nCheck out NAND at https://nand.arhan.sh\nAdditionally, I've authored an extensive writeup about the project.

          "description": "Hi all, we recently open sourced the first version of Hashquery, a Python library which lets you model analytics, DRY up common logic, and execute it against a database or warehouse.\nWe were originally rendering SQL directly for all our queries, but that spiraled out of control with more complex analysis; the SQL needed to be changed sporadically for each new database dialect (BigQuery, Redshift, Aethena, Postgres, etc etc) and the SQL fragments were very challenging to reuse (and so fragments were copy-pasted all over).\n~~~\nAdvantages we think it has over writing SQL by hand:\n- Queries are fully compossible, so any analysis can be chained into further analysis without refactoring.\n- All analysis executes within the data warehouse itself, making them super fast for big data.\n- It's just Python, so you can extend or parameterize query logic with a simple def function.\n- You can run it anywhere, like inside of unit tests, ETL nodes, or Jupyter notebooks.\n- Developer experience is pretty good since editors already know how to autocomplete Python. ChatGPT knows Python already too :)\n- The library handles normalizing between database dialects. Write once and use in any database.\n- Hashquery content is fully serializable, which makes it a good fit for exposing a flexible API for consumers to efficiently query datamarts or internal analytics. We use it as the endpoint for headless BI, as opposed to having to define and teach a DSL or GraphQL specification.\n~~~\nWe've built native funnel analysis on top of Hashquery and have been thrilled with it so far, and we thought others might want to use it too. It's pretty early days so we're still trying to explain it, and the docs aren't perfectly clear, but the examples on the dev site are editable and you can download the pip package to play around with it!\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40132424\nPoints: 49\n# Comments: 16",

Off and on I've helped maintain various Life-related mailing lists and blogs, the Life Lexicon, and more recently the conwaylife.com forums and LifeWiki.\nAnother thing I stumbled into was helping Nathaniel Johnson complete an improbably thorough 480-page Conway's Life textbook, with end-of-chapter exercises and everything.  The book could be used to teach a college-level class on the subject. https://conwaylife.com/book/ has a free PDF download for the book.\nSo... I'm not the cleverest Lifenthusiast by a long shot, but for a random question about the Game of Life, I'm more likely to know something about it than at least 99.9999% of the world's population.

          "description": "Here's what I believe Microsoft (and partners) have in store for the future: they are going all-in on pulling an Apple-style switch to ARM on the PC hardware market. This move has several concomitant side-effects:\n  \nMaking AI a mandatory feature on the PC, with all the juicy free data they will be able to harvest from it. Requiring an NPU (i.e. an AI-capable chip) as a standard on all future PCs.\n Herding all the PC Gamer market onto the XBOX (which will still be Intel/AMD based) and possibly onto other upcoming compatible consoles (there's been talk of allowing Steam and Epic marketplaces on the XBOX platform, which would be HUGE... also, a Steam console, anyone?) It's possible that the x86_64 architecture will remain in wide use as gaming hardware.\n (Possibly) Locking down the ability of booting Linux or any other OS on such ARM hardware. This should be contested with all the Anti-Trust legal recourse available everywhere. (EDIT: disproved here)\n Setting back the advance of the Linux marketshare at least for a while. \n  \nThis last point is the one I would emphasize the most: currently, Linux on ARM seems to be kind of an afterthought among developers, and most distributions have builds targeted at the Raspberry Pi and such small platforms. To my knowledge, only RHEL (and its community clones) offer an ARM build with full desktop capabilities, but these seem to be targeted at servers.\n How long until the major Linux distributions catch up with the switch to ARM, and become ready to deliver the current level of software reliability onto the new PCs?\n Easy with the downvoting, people!\n I am presenting my concerns here, I believe these issues should be discussed. No point in burying the post if you don't fully agree with what I'm saying. I would appreciate your opinion and insight, thanks.\n    submitted by    /u/Economy_Blueberry_25  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Microsoft recently announced that they will officially be monitoring every single action users make. This decision is likely to upset many people, creating an opportunity for Linux developers to capitalize on this advantage. To attract more users, developers should consider increasing advertisements, such as YouTube ads, to highlight the benefits of switching to Linux. Additionally, emphasizing improvements in game support, controller support, ease of use with Wayland, and the new Nvidia 555 driver, which adds explicit sync, could further entice users to make the switch. By focusing on these key areas, Linux could significantly increase its market share. However, advertising could be challenging given the multitude of Linux distributions available. Forming a union or coalition of Linux distributions to pool resources and create unified marketing campaigns could be a viable strategy, although it may be difficult to achieve. To fully capitalize on this moment, Linux developers and advocates should highlight compatibility and support, promote security and privacy, leverage community support, and showcase commercial options. The developers should emphasize the underlying issue with Windows, which is currently privacy and performance, areas where Linux excels. Showcasing commercial options could also be a good start, presenting well-supported commercial distros like Ubuntu, Mint, and Pop!_OS. By implementing these strategies, the Linux community can better position itself to attract users disillusioned by Microsoft's recent actions.\n    submitted by    /u/Comfortable_Two2925  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hi, I’m back again with another question regarding developing for Linux.\n Since my last post here, I have done some more “investigating” about developing applications for Linux. I have played around a bit with Gnome builder, but to be completely honest, using XML for the UI is a complete nightmare, for me as someone who is Dyslexic.. It is not that I have never used XML, i have done some developing for Android using XML, but building UI in GNOME builder is a whole new level of …..\n Blueprints seems way more manageable, a lot more similar to Jetpack Compose.\n Gnome builder doesn’t appear to support Blueprint at all, when taking another look at Workbench, it appears like it could be used as a full blown IDE and not just as a companion tool for Gnome builder.\n Gnome Builder supports C, Vala, Java, Rust.. Workbench appears to support Java, Vala and/or Rust? Workbench seems to be fully capable to convert Blueprint to XML.\n I have also gotten my hands on what I believe is the necessary files to try to develop for Linux using Android Studio with Kotlin Multi-Platform.\n I hope to do some tinkering this weekend, but I would like some advice if possible, could I try using Workbench as an IDE, should I use it as a translation tool (build the UI in workbench using Blueprint, switch it over to XML and copy that in to Gnome Builder), start exploring Kotlin Multi-platform or use some other IDE?\n    submitted by    /u/Whit-Batmobil  \n [link]   [comments]",

However I would keep experiencing constant crashes when compiling large programs or trying to run intensive games - complete lockup of my system, full reboot required. I couldn't even compile swww! I would just have to get lucky if something would actually compile. Yes, granted I should've RMA'ed my CPU but at the time there wasn't much information on the instability of these CPUs. Anyways, I eventually just accepted my fate and rolled with the punches.\n However, recently it has come to light that many people have had similar issues regarding the stability and Intel themselves addressed it - claiming that mobo manufacturers are pushing the CPU too far. (Quite frankly I don't really care who is actually at fault.) These stability issues have forced mobo manufacturers to implement a \"Intel Baseline Profile\" to fix this. \n Upon updating my bios and enabling this option I can comfortably compile anything with no issues whatsoever and as of writing still have not had any issues. So if you're like me and bashing your head into a wall consider, checking your manufacturer's website for a bios update.\n Is this the best solution? I don't know, I'm just happy my PC doesn't crash when doing literally anything CPU intensive.\n TL;DR: 13th and 14th gen K-series CPUs are unstable resulting in crashes of high loads, update bios and enable Intel Baseline Profile.\n Sources: Falcon Northwest, Intel's Statement\n    submitted by    /u/capybara_in_a_coma  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "The current buzz is that Dell and others are coming up with bunch of ARM-powered laptops on the market soon. Yes, I am aware that there already are some on the market, but they might or might not be the next big thing. I wanted informed opinions to what extent this is a threat to the current non-professional use of Linux. As things currently stand, you can pretty much install Linux easily on anything you buy from e.g., BestBuy, and, even more importantly, you can install it on a device that you purchased before you even had any inkling that Linux would be something you'd use.\n Feel free to correct me, but here is as I understand the situation as a non-tech professional. Everything here with a caveat \"in the foreseeable future\".\n  \nIntel/AMD are not going to disappear, and it is uncertain to what extent ARM laptops will take over. There will be Linux certified devices for professionals regardless and, obviously, Linux compatible-hardware for, say, for server use.\n Linux has been running on ARM devices for a long time, so ARM itself is not the issue. My understanding is that that boot systems for ARM devices are less standardized and many current ARM devices need tailored solutions for this. And then there is the whole Apple M-series devices issue, with lots of non-standard hardware.\n  \nSince reddit/the internet is full of \"chicken little\" reactions to poorly understood/speculative tech news, I wanted to ask to what extent you think that the potential new wave of ARM Windows laptops is going to be:\n a) not a big deal, we will have Linux running on them easily in a newbie-friendly way very soon, or\n b) like the Apple M-series, where progress will be made, but you can hardly recommend Linux on those for newbies?\n Any thoughts?\n    submitted by    /u/nongaussian  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Something happened to me today, which has sparked a new rabbit hole for me to run down.\n I recently (last couple months) have gone from DE's to WM's. I have enjoyed it thoroughly. Hyprland has been my sole experience so far, and along with that I have been using Waybar.\n Happy accident. After a recent update (I thought), Waybar failed to load. I was playing around with the config, json modules and style files trying to find out what was causing it to not load properly for me, all the time freaking out that I could no longer see my battery indicator, Network Manager or Blueman applet's, etc...\n Then it hit me. It's not much, I'm on a laptop which is why I was so worried about not having the battery indicator, but that extra bit of screen realestate....was really nice. And had a cool aesthetic without the bar.\n I've played around in the past with auto-hiding bar's and panels. But I've started diving into ways to get around even needing a bar or panel of any kind. With the WM, I haven't been minimising apps, but using different workspaces, so it's not really needed as a place to store minimised apps anymore. At most I have 3-5 workspaces going at a time, so I don't REALLY need a workspace indicator either. I've added a Clock to my browser, which I almost always have one open, and should we really be clock watching anyway?\n So, this has me looking at this \"happy accident\" of Waybar not loading, that is forcing me to re-evaluate and look at a different way of doing things.\n What kind of \"Happy Accidents\" have you had in your Linux or Tech journey's in general?\n (I fixed Waybar, dummy me did a fresh install and forgot to install pavucontrol and so I'm guessing a crashing module was causing it to not load. Installed pavucontrol and now it works fine, but I'm still intrigued by this new path I'm going down.)\n    submitted by    /u/JSinisin  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "It's not clear to me how Chrome encrypt user data in general, as it had migrated away from GNOME Keyring or KDE Wallet (native backend) to loginDB, which could be both unencrypted and encrypted, as shown in Chromium issue #40449930, #40621995, #41451554, and password_store_x.h in the source.\n Also, if anyone on GNOME open Seahorse (the Passwords and Keys app), there will be a dummy entry of Chrome Safe Storage Control with The meaning of life as the password. The reason for this is as explained in Chromium issue #40490926 regarding Libsecret API in comment #8.\n Does this mean that the purpose of system keyring on Linux is only to be used as a dummy entry for Chrome?\n What if Chrome can't access the system keyring, is the user data still being encrypted? For example, in a container environment that can't access the system keyring in any circumstance even with --cap-add=IPC_LOCK and --privileged, see GNOME Keyring issue #77.\n I tested in a rootless Podman container (created by Distrobox), Google's password manager in Chrome is working fine. I can even turn on the on-device encryption feature.\n The password manager also works well in both Edge and Vivaldi in the container environment where the system keyring is not available. It's worth mentioning that as of 01/12/2024, Edge's docs regarding the password manager in the browser is still referring to the system keyring as its encryption method on Linux.\n The only browser that's still using the system keyring to encrypt user data is Brave, as it really has a randomized password in its entry in GNOME Seahorse instead of The meaning of life like Chrome. And it won't allow the user to sync in a container where the system keyring is not available, in which it warns the user about the permission issue in its password manager's GUI.\n I'm worried that other Chromium browsers might silently store unencrypted user data without any warning like Brave. In that case, it would make using those browsers in Distrobox very dangerous.\n    submitted by    /u/3cue  \n [link]   [comments]",

Am I missing something?\n But then the article appears on opensource.com which is supported by Red Hat, no less.\n So for a moment I am a bit bewildered and thinking: Am I missing something? Is there some definition of terminal multiplexers I am not aware of?\n And I look through the comments and no-one calls out the author saying that the last two are not terminal multiplexers.\n So what is going on?\n EDIT: A lot of people seem to equate the ability to open panes or tabs in a terminal emulator with multiplexing. The OP on this SU question summarizes it nicely:\n  \nFrom what I understand now, tmux/screen and other multiplexers are virtual sessions, i.e. multiple virtual sessions within the original session. This is in contrast to opening new tabs in terminal which are actually creating new sessions.\n  \n   submitted by    /u/mydoghasticks  \n [link]   [comments]",

Been searching here and there, skimmed through lots and lots of beautiful music visualization, and in the process stumbled upon three projects/programs/pieces of software that do exactly what I want, just not exactly in the way I'd like to have it, being simply in a terminal, or separate window.\n Someone wrote a DeaDBeeF plugin for it, but that, obviously, requires me to use DeaDBeeF to play the music. Then there's Friture - open source, Python and Qt. If I were capable, I could probably \"lift\" the spectrogram component of the program into its own \"canvas\" thingy or some such, but I don't nearly have the skills.. In the same vein there is Spectro, awesome in action, but brought to me in a browser..\n Does anyone have any advice or counsel?\n e: I coulda/shoulda clarified my question with the simple example of, say, CAVA - visualizing what I'm playing, but then not with a spectrum, but a spectrogram.

          "description": "I've been using ungoogled chromium through Flatpak for 1-2 years now and recently installed the Flatpak backend for my distro's software management GUI to make updates a bit simpler.\n What i didn't expect was that probably around the same time, the package that i've been using (com.github.Eloston.UngoogledChromium) got deprecated and replaced and so updating uninstalled this version and installed the replacement which has a different package ID on Flathub now.\n What i think happened is that because of the new package ID or changes within the package the path for the config has changed. Effectively this meant that after i updated all my packages and started my browser on the next day, everything was completely gone. My backups only run weekly and i've piled up some important bookmarks and tabs in the past couple of days, so at first i was a bit in shock and thought i had lost everything.\n Thinking that software updates should never delete app-related user data (e.g. chromium profiles) i ran `locate chromium` and after a bit of digging discovered the \"lost\" data in `~/.var/...`. After doing a quick backup on those files i just tried forcing the install of the deprecated flatpak package and all my stuff is still here. Now that i'm relieved i can figure out how to properly migrate the data to the new install.\n So now i'm wondering: Would the Flatpak CLI have told me about this deprecation and substitution so that i could expect this? Should i have not used Flatpak and instead used some of the unofficial binaries linked on the project's github.io page? KDE \"Discovery\" = bad for flatpak updating? Or is this all on me and there is some changelog that i must keep up to date with in order not to be surprised by something like this?\n What do you think?\n    submitted by    /u/wffln  \n [link]   [comments]",

Fuck this ChatGPT shit lmao! I am including all of my chat why I had to make this crap post as a reply to one of the comments.\n [Original post]:\n <rant>\n Topic: mprotect() posix feature, C and Linux.\n I learned a couple days ago about this mprotect(..) thing how you can use it to set protection like PROT_READ, PROT_WRITE etc on memory regions that are multiple of the page size the OS is using. To do this, the memory region(s) must be multiple of page size as well as it must be aligned to the page addresses. The memalign(..) or posix_memalign(..) can do those stuff before finally using the mprotect(..);\n Today I found out that it only protects from normal memory access operation like memset, malloc / new etc.\n I can easily change the values of the variables inside a protected (PROT_READ) region from an external memory cheat engine program or using pointer arithmetic from inside the program or even directly accessing the variables within the protected memory region.\n Why the heck do we even have this false sense of \"REaD onLy\" bullcrap in the first place when practically any external malicious program can write into these \"pRoTecTEd\" memory regions? The OS does nothing to protect our memory region despite using the mprotect() bullcrap.\n I just wanted to vent this out somewhere.

          "description": "I spent a lot of time reading and thinking about if I want to learn Emacs or Vim since they have very high learning curves, I went with Vim because I had been looking a way to better edit text. Vim's modal editing is very powerful, allowing me to make lots of changes to text with only a handful of keystrokes. I wonder if that's why most Vim and Neovim users chose it over Emacs and if that's why Vim is much more popular than Emacs.\n Emacs is a modeless editor and you need a third party emulation like Evil mode for modal editing, but that's not full Vim. You wouldn't be able to install Vim or Neovim plugin, especially ones that extend its modal editing capabilities like the Vim surround plugin. Perhaps it might be possible to use the headless Neovim backend for text editing in Emacs, like the VS Code Neovim extension or Firenvim Firefox addon does, but why do that when you could just use Neovim?\n I think that all the extensibility Emacs has to make it essentially an app platform alone isn't something that appeals to a lot of users, but what if Emacs had modal editing as good as Vi / Vim's from the start? It seems like Vi Vim and even Neovim never had the level of extensibility as Emacs does, so what if it was a matter of picking between a modal editor, and a modal editor with lots of extensibility? (an oversimplified hypothetical comparison but still).\n And by the way, what was the rationale for the decision of Emacs to be a modeless editor rather than a modal editor?\n    submitted by    /u/TheTwelveYearOld  \n [link]   [comments]",

This colleague couldn't help himself but comment on how ugly it was. I reassured him that I could make it look like his current laptop setup with minimal effort. After few hours he was pleasantly surprised.\n Why is all Linux UI so unappealing? don't they have designers and UI technician that work on projects? How hard is it to have a consistent style language across specific DE? I'm really baffled at the haphazard approach when it comes to looks of DE in Linux.\n I have seen a video of Linus Torvalds working on the fedora kernel by himself in his bedroom. I know he has a team of community maintainers but c'mon where are the artists and designers?\n Edit: I have tried different DEs and distros with him over the course of few hours. \n Guys I'm not taking about ricing or 'skinning' as we use to call them. I'm talking about underlying design philosophy.\n To me the UI is like an airport. It should be the introduction for the user.

I find that oftentimes the best solution is the one that requires the least friction, and that I don't need fancy stuff. Other 2 things that are a must are \"seamlessness\" - syncing across multiple devices in a timely manner, and reliability (alerts always go off, notes aren't lost etc.).\n    submitted by    /u/LegatusDivinae  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hey everyone! As a student myself, I've been really frustrated with the current note-taking and homework tracking apps out there. They're clunky, confusing, and really not designed with my needs overall in mind. (Google Docs was my go-to but it's not FOSS so fuck it) \n That's why I'm working on creating a brand new productivity app specifically for students - one that makes it super easy to take notes in class, keep track of assignments and due dates, and stay organized. \n The core features I've thought of:\n 📝 Note-Taking: A clean, distraction-free interface to take handwritten or typed notes, with great formatting options like asciidoc and Markdown. Easily organize notes by class.\n 📚 Homework Hub: Enter assignments and due dates from each class. Get reminders (service? cron? idk) so nothing slips through the cracks.\n 👜 Backpack: Upload course materials, study guides, and other files to keep everything in one place. (I might not add this feature unless you guys want it)\n But this is just my initial vision - I want this to be an app built FOR students BY a fellow student. So please comment with any other features you'd love to see! What frustrations could this app solve? What would make your life easier? \n Here's a sketch (keep in mind that I don't really plan to stick to this, and I will be taking your inputs): https://imgur.com/QuBBU3Q\n    submitted by    /u/JustThePerfectBee  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Plenty of folk actively avoid or discourage others from using Ubuntu due to Snap alone. Even those that remain Ubuntu users frequently mention disabling snap. \n Meanwhile, Flatpak is often portrayed in a very different light and its use is actively encouraged when the necessity arises even when it's not enabled by default, whether it be for installing software from outside main repositories without worrying about dependencies, confinement and permission control, installing proprietary software not easily available in distro repositores, accessing versions of software newer than what's packaged in the distro repositories.\n But all these are also the advantages of snap packages, so why wouldn't it be encouraged as well for Ubuntu users?\n Both formats exist for those reasons and pretty much accomplish the same goal. That's like claiming you shouldn't be using Debian because it uses .deb format, use Fedora instead because it uses .rpm format, although both are accomplishing the same. \n Ironically, despite this, some notorious FOSS apps like Obsidian and Bitwarden still prefer to provide an .appimage on their official website, which is odd considering how popular Ubuntu is and how promoted Flatpak is, and the fact that appimages have poor system integration.\n    submitted by    /u/sdnavigator  \n [link]   [comments]",

My question is, should I use '/opt' or '/usr/local/lib', or something else? Or is there some other recommended way?\n Of course, man pages could go into the corresponding system folder for auto discoverability.\n In my case, I'm using a scripting language, so my 'build' folder consists of scripts in different folders, some of which should end up in the user's path.\n Edit: Thanks everyone. I considered Bazel but I couldn't be bothered to learn its philosophy. I don't want to force autotools onto people either. I was about to push through with a makefile but I ran into 3 or 4 roadblocks derived by make's syntax or some mistakes on my part, so I decided to do as one of you suggested and use Make as a tiny interface to a bunch of bash scripts (with `set -e` for good measure) which do what I want to do.

But I truly think this may help somehow to at least new Linux users to not struggle trying to make app image apps to work as any other kind of app installed through snap or apt. \n So I made a quick bash script based repo to generate the entries and update the desktop database so the app can be found in the applications search and so on. \n For those who may find it usefull:\n appimage-desktop-integrator\n If you think it may be usefull but needs some improvements or whatever, I'll check the isues tab or this same post to fix them, and I would be very greatfull as I'm trying to get used to publish more stuff into my github repo. \n Hope this post is not useless or stupid :P\n    submitted by    /u/MrPiradoHD  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "For a long time I have dismissed popOS as a gimmick OS. Yet another flavor with slightly different UI, nothing more. Boy was I wrong...\n I have been using Linux as my daily for well over 15 years now. Mostly Ubuntu, little bit of Mint, about a year on Manjaro. I work as a software dev, but I dont want to spend my spare time fiddling much with the OS. I want it to work. Ubuntu has served me well, but snap has really been annoying lately, and some other bugs (and frustrating window management) made me explore other options.\n What can I say... popOS (22.04, nivida drivers) is just super smooth straight out of the box. It adds sensible nice little touches and tweaks on the existing base. The biggest selling point for me: The built in tiling windows feature. It is smooth, intuitive, and just works. Gnomes handling of this is behind Windows' own approach, which is a frustrating thing to conceit.\n So yea, I love popOS and I cannot wait for the fully standalone DE coming out with popOS 24.\n    submitted by    /u/red-broccoli  \n [link]   [comments]",

Mostly my question is catered towards Wine, is it the same way to install Wine or how can I install Wine to run some exes and what not? I used to have a lot of issues trying to get Wine to play some WoW back then. \n I'm aiming at using Linux Mint since I'm a bit rusty with how Linux works again and KDE might be a bit overwhelming for me, and Mint seems to have everything out of the box, specially considering I have a Nvidia GTX 1660. \n Looking forward to your responses!

It is a program that creates a directory from a list of files defined in a .toml file.\n It can be used for reproducible test/build environments or for simple project templates.\n Some important features are:\n  \nHashes to make sure files are unchanged.\n Multiple sources for one file for redundancy.\n Files can be obtained from archives, or commits of local or remote git-repos.\n Tags can be used for conditional inclusion of files.\n Other config files can be included.\n If the folder already exists, a lot of work is avoided.\n If the recipe is in a git-repo, it can refer to files at the state of its own commit.\n  \nWhy am I telling you this? I am hoping to find people that are willing to test the program. I have implemented some tests, sure, but that just means some testcases I came up with work on my machine. There are likely many obvious bugs.\n I realize, that this is not directly related to Linux, but I guess that this would be a good place to find people who are interested.

          "description": "I finally did it. Took it right out back behind the woodshed and put it down. \n It put up one hell of a fight, though. The entire time I was moving files to backup to physical medium sharedrive kept freezing up the entire system trying to do whatever and sending me constant notifications (hey! Buy more storage!). Then antimalware/ ms defender had to get in on it, too. I swear it knew what was happening because notifications started flying at me like I’ve never seen before; articles from sites I’d never heard of, stock tickers, Google drive syncs. Each moment, each pop up or little “do du do” windows sound made me more and more excited to burn it all and start fresh. \n Then I had to disable secure boot, and spent several hours debugging an old Seagate SSD that was causing all kinds of weird problems when I was flashing it, or after flashing when I was trying to boot from it. I should have guessed by the xbox logo on this thing it was going to betray me. I still don’t know what the issue was, it’s working fine as storage and every scan says it’s cool but I broke down and bought a new usb and it worked on the first try, no driver issues or compatibility mode needed, no random “can’t read from HD0.” \n Now I’m up and running on a fresh Mint Cinnamon Edge and it is beautiful, fast, clean, customizable, and light as a feather. I feel like I just took a long hot shower. I’ve been playing with settings for the last hour and looking at rices. I can’t wait to load my source code on here and start doing graphics work, compile cpp code without jumping through a bunch of hoops, and to fire up a steam game and see how it plays without a bunch of bloatware running in the background. \n I’m never touching windows again unless I have to develop for it, and I’m going to take more steps into the open source ecosystem. This has been a great time and I love my new computer. Linux for life!\n    submitted by    /u/Creature1124  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "CVE-2024-32462 was mentioned here as \"vulnerability found and patched\", but that unfortunately doesn't cover everyone.\n Apparently most distributions quickly adopted the fixed binaries which were available upstream even the day before the post here, but today I've seen a heads up post which I found rather shocking as none of the Ubuntu releases seem to be covered.\n Debian, the distribution Ubuntu is based on is boasting a fixed status in supported versions already: https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2024-32462\n Despite the availability of multiple fix choices upstream both on GitHub and in Debian, Ubuntu doesn't seem to bother: https://ubuntu.com/security/CVE-2024-32462\n I have a bad feeling about this possibly being related to the often mentioned issue of Canonical pushing a competing product. Theories aside, I can state that my host is vulnerable, and that wouldn't be the case if I'd have an ol' trusty Debian instead, or another reputable distribution.\n    submitted by    /u/AntLive9218  \n [link]   [comments]",

The card randomly malfunctions and then is no longer detected by the OS.\n In windows whenever this happens it instantly blue screens.

Only disabling the GPU has now prevented it from crashing.\n In linux however the system never crashes. Sure my external monitor which directly connects to the GPU freezes but the system runs fine. Heck, unlike windows it doesn’t even happen all that often here.\n I have been dual booting on different computers since about a decade ago. Only once have I ever seen a kernel panic.

I use it with 5G on, screen at full resolution, dynamic \"smooth display\" refresh rate is on, no bluetooth or tethering. Brightness left on auto.\n TLDR : Positives = Camera quality, great design & display, OS (with some caveats) | Negatives = everything else\n The positives :\n Camera : beautiful imagery has always been the signature of the Pixel line, and this release is no exception. Every shot has this mesmerizing \"Pixel touch\", and the new ultrawide sensor is finally on par with the main unit. Videos are world class too, not quite on the level of the iPhone but we'll get there eventually.\n Beautiful and unique design : It's sitting…",

While I was aware of several physical limitations like slow charging, 60Hz refresh rate and notch(dynamic island), I always believed that iphone's true magic was its usability. However, using it for few days has made me realize how underwhelming iOS is in terms of basic functionalities. This was definitely not what I expected from an enterprise that prides itself on being design centric. That's why I am writing this use case based assessment of iOS and iphone comparing it with similar functionalities in Android so that anyone thinking about making the switch can make an informed decision.\n Usecase 1) - Segregating Volume levels of app notifications and call ringtone - I get maybe more than 50 notifications a day.

          "description": "2024 ，0513-0519 ，第 20 周\n这周五，一个四年前定下的提醒事项弹了出来，是极简时钟最早的一个域名到期了。\n这个域名绑定的就是极简时钟的静态 landing page ，自打上线后我好像就没动过，导致我都忘了这个页面是 host 在哪里，通过反查 DNS 才知道是一个 GitHub page……\n2020 年正是极简时钟的快速上升期，那时候也有样学样地买了个域名，在网上找了个模板就把这个 landing page 完成了。至于这四年有多少访问量，就无从得知了。\n\n本周开发\n极简日记 iOS\n更新了 v1.7.22 ，修复了导出图片中背景色的问题。要不是用户反馈我都没发现，在给日记中加入 material 背景后，导致导出的图片中半透明的效果全都变成了十分丑陋的灰色。\nGoogle Play 的支付问题\n发现 RevenueCat 的 dashboard 中有很多 0 元续费的订阅，每天都有好几笔，一开始我还以为 app 里有 bug 导致用户可以零元购了呢，这下损失了好多啊。\n\n但是点进去一看，才知道原来是用户遇到了支付错误。在 RevenueCat 里筛选了一下，遇到支付问题的用户还不少，尤其是土耳其和东南亚居多。也不知道这个问题出在谁，是 Google Play 还是 RevenueCat ？\n\n\n又把服务器搞坏了\n一直想把国内安卓版的旧版支付 API 转发到新 API 上，这周终于有所行动了。\n先是在服务器代码上针对旧版 API 的参数做了兼容处理，然后在 nginx 添加了一条测试用的转发路径，最后部署新代码到服务器。\n本以为一都会很顺利，没想到还是出了问题，我发现正式环境里有两条付款记录没有生成对应的会员记录。经过一番排查，才发现是我画蛇添足，新建会员记录的 SQL 里添加了一个不存在的 field ，导致插入数据失败。这个插入操作是只有在收到微信支付的回调后才会执行的，而偏偏这一点我没测试到。保险起见，我就回滚代码了，那两个会员记录我也只好手动录入了。\n还好，只有两个。\n然而，第二天上午，我发现了数据库里又多了两笔 1 分钱的支付记录。我一开始还以为是安卓小哥在做测试，但是他说并没有……最终发现原来是我回滚代码的时候把价格的配置文件也给回滚了，所有的价格都恢复成了测试的价格，都是 1 分钱……偏巧有两个用户以 1 分钱解锁了原价 24 元的终身会员。\n还好，只有两个。\n本周减肥\n这周两次健身+游泳。周二游泳 1000 米游进了 40 分钟，周四的 1000 米又快了 2 分钟，38 分钟。单次连续游的距离也越来越长，最长可以连续游 300 米了。\n最近明显感觉所有裤子都肥了，都挂不住腰了。在南京旅游的时候还发现，上衣的尺码比之前小了一号。我还以为身体维度真的减小了，但是周日晚上用尺子一测，和之前的数据没有任何区别啊。\n体脂秤上的数据和 325 天之前对比，竟然一斤都没减掉，这令我很震惊。不过由于最近的运动，确实减掉了 9 斤脂肪，又增长了 9 斤肌肉，体脂率下降很多。\n\n本周开心\n这周读完了《认知觉醒》，收获颇多。说实话，这本书提到的诸多概念和行动指南，在其他书里也都有涉及，这本书本身也多次提到其他相关的书籍，比如《微习惯》《思考快与慢》《刻意练习》《心流》《暗时间》等等。但是，同样的道理，用这本书的作者周岭的话讲出来，不知道为什么，就令我感觉更好理解和接受，也解答了很多我关于拖延、焦虑、和自我提升上的困惑。\n\n还有一个，剑星，周四完成了一周目，周日完成了二周目和白金，一共花了 54 个小时。这是我买过最贵的一个游戏了，之前玩过 demo 版之后就果断下单了数位豪华版，也是我第一个玩了二周目的动作剧情类游戏。\n伊芙？衣服！在我看来，黑珍珠真的没意思，枉费大量时间和精力去舔图，还不如星球空降服原型。",

          "description": "2018 年我购买了人生中的第一台苹果设备 —— MacBook Pro 2018 ，作为陪伴我三年的 Dell Inspiron 7558 2-in-1 的继任者（时至今日，它依然是我最喜欢的笔记本电脑）。\n这台苹果笔记本在蒂姆·库克作为 Apple CEO 的时期内，“革命性”地采用了 OLED 显示屏、Touch Bar 和蝶式键盘，并在发布会上被大肆宣传。实际使用下来体验非常糟糕，Touch Bar 上的触摸功能键经常让我在调试程序时按错键，蝶式键盘特别容易出现按键粘连，作为不使用外置键盘的程序员来说，这简直就是灾难。而且不到两个月，OLED 屏幕四周就开始泛黄，烧屏。 这样的一台「库克制造」电脑在当时花费我两万块钱。而苹果糟糕的售后预约制度和（当时）动辄一周的维修时间让我放弃了维修的打算。\n后来 MacBook 终于移除备受争议的蝶式键盘。Touch Bar 是在 2021 年取消的，同时，库克居然把 iPhone 的刘海屏移植到 MacBook 上。也就是说，从 2015 至今，MacBook 用户至少要经历蝶式键盘、Touch Bar 或刘海屏，而我一次体验其中两种。\n作为苹果用户，我很难想象在库克的时期里，这十年来是如何做到每一代 MacBook 至少包含一种缺陷。制造一台基本完美的电子设备对一家市值常年世界第一的企业来说是否非常有挑战性？如果把库克当成一名商人，商人的目的就是贩卖商品，那库克一定非常出色的商人。库克时期以来制造的这些不完美的电子设备，甚至动用降频手段来刺激更新换代，把苹果的市值从几千万推到了最高三万亿。作为苹果用户，我一点也不喜欢库克。但从投资的角度来说，我又会用一套完全相反的说辞来说服自己购买苹果股票。2020 年我通过基金也间接重仓了苹果，见证苹果短短半年从 1 万亿涨到 2 万亿。\n苹果的库克时代在 2024 好像悄然翻篇，造车计划终止、错失 AI 时代、营收下滑、Vision Pro 销量不佳… 即使站在投资的角度我也很难再找到说服自己看多苹果的理由。\n库克时期内的苹果，充斥着商品的气味，缺乏划时代的创新。\n（文章写于 2024 年，使用 MacBook Pro 2018 ）\n转载于 https://vm0x00.com/posts/tim-cook @vm0x01",

          "description": "做为一名新手创业者，深刻清楚高质量信息流的重要性。\n职场、亲友这种强关系可以带来基于信任+共同认知的深度交流，更多新的机会来自于在弱关系交流中的挖掘，以及对于社会资源的整合。\n如果你的圈子都是一直打工的上班族，那大概率很难互相激发新的视角去思考问题。\n所以通过拓展圈子，去重置语境非常重要。\n我自己运营着超过千人的离职校友微信社群，以及十个以上的陌生人社群，也基于好奇心，添加了很多不同发起主题的社群。根据观察，大多数微信群是比较松散的组织型态、仅仅做为信息即时交流场所存在（这也跟微信原本的产品形态有关），人数超过三位数的社群，潜水的情况就会比较明显，同时很难（有意愿）开展深入沟通。\n兴趣社群+有过共同经历、线下见过面的社群（比如在一起学过什么课程）相对交流氛围会好些，归属感强一些吧。\n归根到底，主要有以下几个原因导致：\n1.不知道如何提问。有时候一个大的问题很难在社群这种交流形态里得到有效解答（论坛是更合适的公开讨论场域），拆成具体问题又不知道路径。\n2.提问后回复有时差，再加上不同话题间没法区隔，也就失去了讨论的氛围。\n3.收到回复的信息视角丰富度不够。现在每个人的群都很多+有高质量信息的人往往没太有时间回复，比如创业者群，我自己也是想提问的时候才会去群里看看。\n以上，有两个问题想要探讨：\n1.微信社群是否只能当作一个通知工具来用———对照大多数人不活跃的状态，有没有优化的可能性。\n比如通过 a.机制（设置入群门槛、指定值班的人）、b.运营（定期发起活动）等重度运营方式。\n有没有类似的案例参考？做过私域的人可能都比较关心这个问题。\n2.衍生思考：个体在当前变化加速的时代背景下，就算不创业，也是需要职场关系外的长期归属感的，如何打造这样的组织呢？",

          "description": "大家好，我是 V2EX 的新成员，一名对编程充满热情的新手开发者。经过数月的努力和自学，我非常激动地宣布，我开发了自己的第一款 Web 应用 - ImageEditor.online 。这是一个在线图像编辑器，提供了包括 Image Restore 、Generative Fill 、Object Remove 、Object Recolor 以及 Background Remove 等功能。\n在开始这个项目之前，我只是一个编程爱好者，通过在线的开源课程和教程，我逐步学习了 Web 开发的基础知识。在这个过程中，我萌生了一个想法，那就是打造一个既实用又易于使用的在线图像编辑器。\n开发过程：\n技能学习： 我首先专注于学习 HTML 、CSS 和 JavaScript ，然后逐步掌握了 React 框架，以便构建前端界面。\n功能实现： 为了让 ImageEditor.online 具备先进的图像处理功能，我集成了多个 AI 图像处理 API ，实现了包括图像修复、生成式填充、对象移除和背景去除等功能。\n用户体验： 在开发过程中，我不断测试和优化用户界面，以确保用户能够轻松上手并享受编辑图像的乐趣。\n上线与推广： 最终，我将 ImageEditor.online 部署到了线上，并通过社交媒体和开发社区进行了推广。\n成果与展望：\n到目前为止，ImageEditor.online 已经收到了来自用户的积极反馈，他们对应用的易用性和功能表示满意。我也从中学到了很多，并且计划继续添加新的功能和改进用户体验。\n我非常期待听到 V2EX 社区成员的宝贵意见和反馈，以帮助我进一步改进 ImageEditor.online 。同时，我也希望我的经历能够激励其他新手开发者，勇敢地开始自己的项目。\n谢谢大家！\n如果你对 ImageEditor.online 感兴趣，欢迎访问网站并尝试其功能,我也在 github 开源了这个项目 https://github.com/Deyong888/ai_saas_app 。如果你有任何问题或建议，请随时在评论区留言。我会积极回应大家的反馈，并继续努力打造更好的产品。\n再次感谢 V2EX 社区的支持！让我们一起成长，创造更多的可能性！\nV2EX 的各位前辈和朋友们，我迫不及待地想听听你们的想法！",

          "description": "引言\n前不久上线的网站www.pdf2docx.cn，有些 pdf 转 word 的时候，存在有些文件存在转换不了的情况，经过查找资料，发现 pdf 还有一些安全属性，导致没有权限去紧张转换\n\n好家伙，竟然被不允许了，那就找工具修改属性！！！\n经过调查，发现qpdf 工具挺好使的，可以很方便解除 PDF 文件的安全属性，比如编辑、打印或页面提取的限制。后台是用 golang 实现的，在 Golang 中调用开源的 qpdf 工具，我们可以轻松完成这一任务。本文将分享如何在 Golang 程序中集成 QPDF ，以及如何处理解除 PDF 限制过程中常见的错误。\n环境设置\n安装 QPDF\n首先，您需要确保系统上安装了 QPDF 。如果还没有安装，请按照以下步骤安装：\nWindows 用户：在 QPDF Releases 页面下载并解压 qpdf 可执行文件，将其添加到系统 PATH 中，或将 qpdf.exe 与 Golang 项目放在同一个目录下。\n\n代码实现\n在 Golang 中调用 QPDF ，可以使用 os/exec 包中的 exec.Command 函数：\npackage main\n\nimport (\n\t\"fmt\"\n\t\"os/exec\"\n)\n\n// RemovePDFRestrictions 使用 qpdf 移除 PDF 文件的限制。\nfunc RemovePDFRestrictions(inputFile, outputFile string) error {\n\t// 这里我把 qpdf.exe 放在了本程序的同意目录下。\n\tcmd := exec.Command(\"./qpdf.exe\", \"--decrypt\", inputFile, outputFile)\n\n\t// 获取 QPDF 执行结果\n\toutput, err := cmd.CombinedOutput()\n\toutputStr := string(output)\n\n\t// 打印完整的 QPDF 命令输出，以便调试\n\tfmt.Println(\"QPDF Output:\", outputStr)\n\n\tif err != nil {\n\t\texitError, ok := err.(*exec.ExitError)\n\t\tif ok {\n\t\t\t// 检查退出状态\n\t\t\tif exitError.ExitCode() == 3 {\n\t\t\t\t// 退出状态 3 通常意味着警告\n\t\t\t\tfmt.Println(\"QPDF completed with warnings.\")\n\t\t\t\treturn nil // 忽略这些警告\n\t\t\t}\n\t\t}\n\t\treturn fmt.Errorf(\"qpdf failed with %s: %s\", err, outputStr)\n\t}\n\n\treturn nil\n}\n\nfunc main() {\n\t// 调用函数解除 PDF 限制\n\terr := RemovePDFRestrictions(\"source.pdf\", \"unrestricted.pdf\")\n\tif err != nil {\n\t\tfmt.Println(\"Error:\", err)\n\t} else {\n\t\tfmt.Println(\"PDF restrictions removed successfully.\")\n\t}\n}\n\n错误处理\n上面的代码提供了完整的错误处理逻辑：\n警告：如果 QPDF 以退出码 3 退出，它会发出一些警告，但文件通常已经成功生成。\n错误：任何其他的退出码都表明执行失败，我们需要报告相关的错误信息。\n总结\n至此，对于被安全属性锁定的 pdf ，就拥有了页面提取权限，可以进行转换了，快来体验下吧，效果杠杠滴。www.pdf2docx.cn",

          "description": "Google Authenticator 支持设备间转移和 google 云备份，但是在软件内不能直接查看到密钥，不能很方便的进行密钥的本地保存和备份，或者是迁移到其它 2FA 平台。这里介绍一个从 Google Authenticator 解密获取到 2FA 密钥的工具和使用方法。\n操作过程\n导出配置文件二维码\n打开 Google Authenticator ，点击左上角的三条横线按钮，选择转移账号\n选择导出账号\n勾选需要导出的账号并点击下一步\n这里我们会看到一个二维码，截图保存为文件，比如ga.jpg。\n使用 decodeGoogleOTP 工具解码\n为了方便整个过程，我写了一个命令行工具 decodeGoogleOTP ，前往Github 下载页面，根据自己的平台，下载最新版本的工具。\n下载后解压，为了方便操作可以重命名一下，比如 windows 平台重命名为decodeGoogleOTP.exe，然后和ga.jpg放在一个文件夹下。\ndecodeGoogleOTP 支持将结果导出为 csv 文件、json 文件、txt 文件或者二维码图片等多种格式。如果我们需要将结果导出为 json 文件，运行如下命令即可\ndecodeGoogleOTP -i ga.jpg -c output.json\n\n输出的结果格式如下：\n[\n  {\n    \"issuer\": \"\",\n    \"name\": \"xx\",\n    \"secret\": \"AAAAAAAAAAA\",\n    \"type\": \"totp\",\n    \"counter\": 0,\n    \"url\": \"otpauth://totp/xx?secret=AAAAAAAAAAA\"\n  }\n]\n\n其中secret字段就是 2FA 密钥，有了密钥就可以方便的转移到其它平台。而url可以用来生成二维码供其它 2FA 软件扫描导入，也可以使用 decodeGoogleOTP 直接导出二维码图片供扫描\n更详细的使用方法参考下面的说明\n$ decodeGoogleOTP -h\n\ndecodeGoogleOTP is a command line tool to decode Google OTP QR codes. Output can be json, csv, qrcode or plain text.\n\nUsage:\n  decodeGoogleOTP [flags]\n  decodeGoogleOTP [command]\n\nAvailable Commands:\n  completion  Generate the autocompletion script for the specified shell\n  help        Help about any command\n  version     Print current version of the application\n\nFlags:\n  -c, --csv string      Output in CSV format and specify the output file\n  -d, --debug           Enable debug mode\n  -h, --help            help for decodeGoogleOTP\n  -i, --input string    Input file path\n  -j, --json string     Output in JSON format and specify the output file\n  -p, --print-qr        Print QR code to terminal\n  -q, --qrcode string   Output in QR code image format and specify the output directory\n  -s, --silent          Enable silent mode\n  -t, --text string     Output url list in plain text format and specify the output file\n  -u, --url string      Output in URL format and specify the output file\n  -v, --version         Print version information\n\nUse \"decodeGoogleOTP [command] --help\" for more information about a command.",

          "description": "随着这几年移动互联网的爆发，手机几乎可以做任何的事，不管是娱乐，工作等。前几年不管是做什么都先下载个 app 吧，现在这几年是不管什么搜一下找一下对应的公众号或者是小程序。\n我身边有一些朋友，基本上工作电脑都是公司的台式机，家里只有那种很落后，很旧的笔记本，而生活中的一切都会用手机解决，不管是买东西，不管是追剧，不管是考试学习，而一些基本的游戏，比如《消消乐》，比如《王者荣耀》等，也基本满足他们的需求了。\n在这个移动互联网时代，我始终有些格格不入。我还是更偏向于使用电脑，现在一回家的状态就是先把电脑打开，手机什么的都扔一边。\n为什么用电脑？\n效率高\n电脑屏幕大，能看到的东西更多，不像手机那么小的屏幕，看个小说看了一点点东西就得翻页，就得左划右划，看个电影人物都看不清楚，用电脑购物，手机一页可能就是显示几个商品，电脑一页屏幕显示十几个商品，这效率完全不能比。\n跟别人聊天，我也更愿意使用电脑版微信，键盘打字的速度比手机上戳戳戳的速度快多了。\n再看看手机百度和电脑百度搜出来的内容，且不说显示内容数量的多少了，这个电脑完胜，就连显示的内容， 手机上也大多充斥着各种广告，更恶心的是，现在手机的搜索结果是，你找到对应的内容，直接给你跳转到对应的 app 下载界面。不用它家的 app ，你不能看，你气不气？\n自由化程度高\n针对电脑的浏览器，我一般习惯于装各种的浏览器插件，比如去广告的，比如一些翻译插件，比如一些保存为 html 的插件，这样搜出来的内容也更符合我的要求。\n再次是电脑有一些私人定制的软件，极大的可以提高效率，当然手机上也会有，但是显然电脑上的会更齐全。我以前很不喜欢用 iphone ，就是因为觉得 iphone 的封闭性太高，软件就只能在 app store 里下载。所以就造成了一种现象，我用了 mac 好几年了，但也没有用 iphone 。直到去年用了 mac 将近 3 年后，才换掉了用了 9 年的小米。\n游戏\n游戏这方面更不用说了吧，完全是吊打，像我之前经常玩的《真三国无双》,《古墓丽影》系列,《极品飞车》系列，甚至于最开始火的《英雄联盟》，《吃鸡》系列，哪个不是先在电脑平台上大获成功的。\n对一台好电脑的执着\n小时候我的梦想就是想要一台超强的笔记本，然后去哪都可以带着它。这个梦想起源于《数码宝贝》里的光子郎，他在数码宝贝的世界里可以打开电脑随时查看各种怪兽的基本情况，真酷啊。不过现在想想还是太年轻了，随身带电脑的人命真苦啊，随时随地就得准备干活，你见过哪个老板随身背着电脑啊？都是一些卑微的打工人好吧。\n回顾这些年的败家之路，我一直在追求一台很强很强的电脑，买了很多的电脑，大学换过两台电脑，工作之后换了更多，包括 surface pro 4, 戴尔 xps 13,联想第一代的 Y9000x （当时看到上海张江高科地铁站里贴的广告，专门为程序员设计的电脑，回去了解了一番，真的很心动）。刚毕业的那几年，属实有些败家，基本上每年都换一次电脑。最近用的电脑是 macbook pro16 2019,相对稳定一些，用了快 4 年了。\n笔记本不满足，又开始买台式机，现在用的还是 aurora 7 ，前不久坏了一次，我把内存条和固态重新换了个遍，终于又满血复活了，这个台式机已经用了 6 年多了，感觉还可以坚持一段时间。程序员的为数不多的快乐就是电脑吧，我还没有自己组过电脑，后面等攒钱买了配件之后再试试。\n最近国内网页的一些起色\n国内给我的一种趋势就是越来越重视移动端，越来越不重视网页端，好多应用都没有网页端，包括咸鱼，包括拼多多，淘宝，京东的网页端甚至做了一些恶心的规则，不登录就不能使用。\n不过最近也有一些好的消息，淘宝重新上线了网页端，我第一时间去体验了一下，UI 好像比以前更好看了一些，但是这个居中的布局，两边还留了一些空隙，让我觉得有点丑。\n抖音最近也有网页端了，比起手机上只能看一个视频，我一打开抖音网页端，一下子能看到几十个视频，真的仿佛打开了新的世界的大门。\n总结\n移动互联网固然有它的优势，最重要的是随时随地吧，就比如转个钱，不用专门跑一趟银行了，微信电话，微信视频，一下子就可以拉近人们之间很多的距离。但是我还是更偏向于用电脑，希望电脑这个夕阳行业越来越好。",

          "description": "微信状态功能推出已经三年有余，至今仍然不温不火。为什么微信状态没能如 Snapchat 、Instagram 等平台上的 Stories 功能一样取得成功呢？从我个人的心理活动来看，我觉得是太麻烦……\n首先我是个很少发朋友圈的人，频率约为一个月发一条甚至几个月发一条，毕竟微信通讯录里的人很杂，我并不想随便一个小事都发朋友圈去打扰所有人，也懒得去分组。事实上我发现身边很多朋友也越来越少发朋友圈。所以看起来微信状态挺适合我们这样的人，碰到一个有意思的东西就可以随手拍张照片在微信状态分享，正如微信团队所说这功能可以让用户「减轻表达压力」。\n但当我真的从「我」标签页点开那个小小的「+状态」按钮打开发状态的界面后，问题来了，我需要选一个状态表情：「美滋滋」「裂开」「求锦鲤」「 emo 」……拜托我就只是想随手分享一张照片啊。翻遍几十个状态，每个都很夸张，往往找不到一个适合的，唯一看起来中庸一点的那个「(未知)」则显得很奇怪，所以这时候我可能得手动填写状态词，比如「随拍」「哈哈」。好吧，整个流程就感觉很麻烦、很刻意，完全没有 Instagram 那种看见一个东西有意思就能迅速从顶部点开入口、分享内容、别人也能从顶部很方便地点击头像查看内容的顺畅。\n所以我觉得这个功能是腾讯「模仿/微创新」的模式翻车了，还不如完全照搬 Instagram 的 Stories 功能。",

          "description": "这是一个信息过载的时代，也是一个信息匮乏的时代。\n这种矛盾的现象在 Python 编程语言上的表现非常明显。\n它是常年高居编程语言排行榜的最流行语言之一，在国外发展得如火如荼，开发者、项目、文章、播客、会议活动等相关信息如海如潮。\n但是，形成鲜明对比的是，它在国内的就业形势一片黯淡，开发者数量与知识社区常年都萎靡不振（除了培训机构的广告满天飞）。\n国内 Python 社区与西方主流社区存在着巨大的信息差。我多年持续观察，对此感受颇深，这里从两个较为直观的维度能看出差距有多大：\n文章的数量。国内做得最好的技术平台是掘金（除公众号不好统计外，其它都差一大截），Python 分类下每天的文章数基本不超过 20 篇；国外的平台有 Medium 、DEV 社区、Hashnode 、Reddit 等，每一个都能压掘金一筹。至于 Python 类个人博客，那就更不用提了\n播客的数量。国内只有“捕蛇者说”一株独苗，更新的内容和频率都很佛系；国外的播客非常多，2019 年有篇文章介绍了 27 个，如今只会更多，我记得在去年的 Python 潮流周刊里就介绍过 4 档新的播客\n除此之外，还有开源项目、社区活动、公司招聘、以及最最重要的是创造出这些东西的贡献者，感觉那一边是璀璨若繁星，而这一边微似点点流萤。\n为了弥补这一信息差距，我创办了“Python 潮流周刊”。\n周刊自 2023 年 5 月连载至今，到下一期就是第 50 期了，时间正好是一周年！\n我过去有些疑虑，不知道自己能坚持更新多久，对于内容和运营手段也没有考虑得太清楚，因此，既没有写下过什么“创刊语”，也没有好好向大家推销过。\n在《技术周刊的转变：如何平衡热爱与现实？》里，我解释了为什么会转向付费专栏。经过最近几期的试运行，正好遇上周岁生日的节点，于是，我决定就从第 50 期开始（预计时间为 5 月 12 日），让我们开启一段新的旅程…",

          "description": "看到帖子跳出自己的舒适圈，想到了最近三年来自己改变掉的一些习惯，帮助自己提升了许多，跟大家分享一下。\n学会标准指法和双拼。毕业之前一直没有用标准指法，打字最早是二指禅，后来慢慢形成自己的手指映射习惯，但一些按键盲打很容易按错，临近毕业的时候下决心学了标准指法，大概一周的时间完全适应，两周的时间已经比原先的盲打要快很多了。有了这一次成功改变习惯的经历后，很快下决心学习双拼输入法，一个月内达到了之前的打字速度，现在比之前也更快了。\n学会 vim 的键位，接触 neovim 并配置完整的前端开发环境。上学的时候曾经短暂接触过 vim ，因为那时候有一个课程设计的作业需要在一个命令行界面的虚拟机中编写代码，只会 hjkl 和 i 。在标准指法和双拼熟练后，我有信心学会 vim 的绝大部分常用操作，毕竟我自身也很认可用 vscode 写代码的时候，切换键盘和鼠标是一件很麻烦的事情。这件事当然也成功了，虽然 neovim 并没有深入研究（使用了 astro nvim 的方案）。目前使用 vscode+vim 插件，配合把 astro nvim 的一些按键映射到 vscode 的命令，加上 easy motion ，现编辑代码明显能更快跟上我的脑子了。\n习惯 Mac 的快捷键。从大部分 Mac 和 Windows 都有客户端的软件来看，Mac 看起来像是把 Windows 的 Ctrl 键拆分成了一部分 Command 和一部分 Control 。工作后公司配的电脑是 Mac ，所以不得不开始熟悉 Mac 的使用。最开始我会纠结，是不是要统一双端的快捷方式，但有了相信自己的习惯可以改变的信念后，我还是坚持 Mac 上就用 Mac 的一套，Windows 上就用 Windows 的一套。实践下来其实同时拥有两套对 Ctrl 按键的认知，是不会有什么问题的，只要你足够相信自己，时间长了你既能熟悉 Mac 也能熟悉 Windows 。\n主要的就是这三个例子，其余还有很多小的事情，总之，当我第一件事情成功之后，我逐渐建立起这种信念，无论多么坚固的习惯都是可以被改变的。而这个信念的强大之处就在于，它可以让你开始练习形成一个新的，对你更好的习惯。这个信念比那些什么 21 天养成习惯的鸡汤，或者各种提醒 app 都更有用。相信自己可以做到，就真的能够做到。\n分享这些希望大家能够相信自己想要改变的一些习惯是真的可以改掉的，然后动手努力去让改变发生。\n也欢迎大家分享自己成功改变习惯/形成习惯的例子。",

          "description": "大概三个月前，回收邮寄的物品被咸鱼商家重新邮寄退回，退件时商家主动问我收件人信息，这次我留了真实可拨通的电话号码。由于咸鱼平台不显示退单号，且联系商家未果，这事就拖了两个月。 然后我突然想起有这么以个快递一直没处理完，于是找到商家，商家提供了快递单号并显示三个月前已投放到菜鸟驿站，且 2 个月前已被签收。 \n我立即联系快递员，快递员答复：东西放菜鸟驿站后出库了，已签收，东西找不到了，菜鸟驿站要赔偿。问我物损价值，我回复 90 元。然后快递员找菜鸟驿站处理，过了两天，没收到赔款却被告知物品找到了（看背景是在客厅沙发上），但是包裹的包装已经不见了。 我要求快递员必须给我一个合理解释，但是快递员没有答复。\n4 月底想起这件事，我就直接找菜鸟驿站理论。 驿站老板答复： 由于你的快递电话都是打不通的，联系不到人；那个快递东西没有丢，已经拿给快递员了。（为了网购方便，快递我一般都是留一个打不通的电话号码。由于中通等快递都一股脑把快递送到菜鸟驿站，所以一般不影响我取件）。我说不可能，我当时留的电话可以打通，私拆快递肯定是违法行为，他说你有本事就去报警。\n考虑到以前就有十元附近的小物品多次在菜鸟驿站丢件，邻里群里也有邻居丢快递，我觉得菜鸟驿站监守自盗的情况应该有很多次了。虽说将军赶路不打小兔，但这种惯犯主管恶意大，不加制止，将来会越来越过分。\n想到几个点：\n（ 1 ）对方答复我的快递电话打不通，其实是看到我的电话就第一反应不需要打（对方一见面就直接报出了我的收件常用网名，他自然记得我），放一个月不领取，他直接昧了也难以追究他责任，想钻空子但没想到我这次留了真实号码；\n（ 2 ）参考最高检相关文章（ https://www.spp.gov.cn/spp/llyj/202111/t20211116_535512.shtml ）盗窃罪的入罪方式大致分为两类，一是依据数额入罪，即数额型盗窃；二是依据行为入罪，即行为型盗窃。小额盗窃多次，应该肯定可以被处罚。但是我目前只能证实一次，以前丢失的快递，由于已被冒名签收，难以取证，也更难以证实我没有收到快递。\n（ 3 ）快递站坚守自盗，算是盗窃行为吗？ 如果是，我报警一次不能将其绳之以法，但是会降低其作恶额度（三年内只能再犯两次，否则判刑）。且这家在附近小区同时开了两～三家菜鸟驿站，他们的作案额度可能被比较高（老两口➕小两口有 4 个人合计最多 8 次免罪额度）\n（ 4 ）菜鸟驿站收到快递如果无法派送成功，有无权利处分我的快递？  即便是作为无主物，也应该是快递公司处理，菜鸟驿站派送不成功也只能退回快递，而不是冒领。\n（ 5 ）邮政管理局只管快递公司不管驿站，如何投诉这个菜鸟驿站？\n想问下各位尤其是懂法律的朋友，该如何维权？  目前我的想法是以盗窃为由报治安 110 。如果不能立案，我将向帽子叔叔索取不予立案通知书，以便于后续投诉和群发。",

          "description": "最近 Netflix 打击合租账号，但是我看到基本上 Apple TV 合租仍然没有受到影响。基于这个情况，产生以下几个疑问，希望大佬们帮忙解答一下：\n1. 安卓盒子合租受影响，但是 Apple TV 合租不受影响的原因是什么？是因为 Apple 对于用户的隐私保护比较到位，导致 Netflix 看不到用户 IP ，还是因为 Netflix 无法区分 Apple TV ，iPhone 和 iPad 的用户？\n2. 亚马逊的 Fire TV Cube 和 Fire TV Stick 4K Max 是不是因为基于安卓盒子的魔改，也受到了 Netflix 对于合租的限制？\n3. 如果因为就是想参加 Netflix 合租的想法而去入手 Apple TV ，现在还是个好时机吗？还是说，Netflix 的合租限制接下来也会包括 Apple TV ？\n谢谢各位大佬的指点！",

It's an open source data anonymization and synthetic data generation platform called Neosync, you can check out the github here. The idea is that you can use Neosync to :\nanonymize sensitive data so it’s safe for developers to use in stage, dev, local, etc.\nsync data across environments - including subsetting with full referential integrity\ngenerate synthetic data for better debugging, testing and feature development\nWe've gotten good feedback from teams that have sensitive data (whether it's GDPR, DPDP in india, PII, PHI, etc.).\nAlso have some devops teams using it to just easily sync data across multiple environments that are separated by VPCs without using PGDUMP. We support postgres, mysql and s3 today and building support for mongodb.\nWould love any feedback that folks have!",

          "description": "前言\n随着金融科技的迅猛发展，股票行情和股票报价数据的获取变得越来越便捷。对于投资者和交易员而言，通过股票数据 api 获取准确、实时的 A 股港股美股等股票行情和 K 线数据至关重要，因为这些数据可以帮助他们做出明智的投资决策。在这篇文章中，我将介绍几款不错的股票行情报价 API ，以满足不同投资者的需求。\n首先，让我们来看看一些提供股票行情和报价数据的 API 。市场上有许多可靠的 API 供应商，它们包括 A 股、港股和美股等。它们提供了丰富的数据接口，可以获取实时的股票行情和报价数据。无论是股票的最新价格、交易量还是市值，这些 API 都能提供全面的信息。除了股票行情和报价数据，许多投资者还对 K 线数据感兴趣。K 线图是一种常见的股票图表，能够显示一段时间内的开盘价、收盘价、最高价和最低价等信息。对于技术分析师和交易员而言，K 线数据是分析股票走势和制定交易策略的重要依据。\n在这里，我们列出比较知名的股票行情报价 API 供应商进行比较，以便让您更好地选择。\n1 、Bloomberg\nBloomberg 是全球最著名的金融信息和技术服务提供商之一，其行情报价 API 覆盖股票、债券、期货、外汇等多个市场领域。Bloomberg 的优势在于其丰富的数据内容和高精度的数据质量。但是，Bloomberg 的 API 价格比较昂贵，不太适合个人投资者和小型机构使用。\n2 、AllTick\nAllTick 提供了免费的股票行情报价 API 服务，降低了数据获取成本，而且覆盖的市场领域也非常广泛。它提供了免费的 API 服务，同时保证了数据的高可靠性和稳定性，适合各类用户使用。AllTick 的数据质量较高，覆盖的市场领域也更加广泛，同时提供了完整的 API 文档和多种编程语言的接口，使其在使用方面更加方便，AllTick 是一家非常优秀的行情报价 API 供应商，其数据质量高、价格实惠、易于使用、稳定性好等优点，使其在与其他知名的 API 供应商相比较时有着很强的竞争力。\n[官网] ：网页链接 \n[ Github ] ： 网页链接\n3 、Alpha Vantage\nAlpha Vantage 是一家提供行情报价 API 服务的公司，其 API 覆盖股票、期货、外汇等多个市场领域。Alpha Vantage 的优势在于其价格实惠和易于使用的 API 文档。但是，Alpha Vantage 的数据质量相对较低，可能存在数据不准确的问题。\n4 、Intrinio\nIntrinio 是一家提供行情报价 API 服务的公司，其 API 覆盖股票、期货、外汇等多个市场领域。Intrinio 的优势在于其稳定性和高质量的数据。但是，Intrinio 的价格相对较高，可能不太适合个人投资者和小型机构使用。",

          "description": "我的博客是用 Github Page 部署的，用起来都挺不错。我现在想加一点点实时展示的内容（比如说一些实时的心情，数据撑死五十条），如果每次数据更改都 push 到 github 不太好，为了它重做一遍网站也不至于。所以问问 V 友有没有什么轻量的数据库（或者能满足要求的其他方案），我在本地写入，然后用 JS 通过 API 读取，更新在网页上。\n也不一定是传统意义上的数据库，我觉得云文档差不多就够了，我试过以下几款：\nNotion 。 整体都很不错，但是考虑到在大陆的访问速度，可能会影响用户体验\n飞书多维表格。功能很庞大，同时安全性极高，两个小时就要换一次 token ，杀鸡焉用牛刀啊\n维格表。读取和写入共用一个 token ，我要在前端读取的话，实在不是很安全\n总结一下，我应该需要一个这样的产品：\n越轻量越好\n大陆地区访问顺畅\n读取不需 token / 读写权限分离\n（我觉得这么小的需求免费应该可以解决吧）\n大家每天要实现的可能都是很大型的，看到我这种苍蝇大小的需求还请别见怪。V 友如果有更好的思路也欢迎赐教，谢谢大家了。",

          "description": "近日，香飘飘包装“讽日事件”在网络和市场上引发了不小的反应。据5月9日《新民周刊》报道，从该事件登上微博热搜，到香飘飘直播同款产品爆火，再到如今被质疑摆拍操作，香飘飘经历了股价先后大涨和大跌。\n\r\n\r\n从公开信息来看，该事件的发展脉络可以分为两个阶段——主打个人行为的第一阶段和主打公司行为的第二阶段。\n\r\n\r\n事件源起于5月3日有网友晒出，日本某商店销售的香飘飘旗下MECO果茶产品的杯托上，印有嘲讽日本排放核污水的标语，内容包括“请日本政客把核污水喝了”等。香飘飘投资者热线相关人员表示，该事件为员工个人行为。\n\r\n\r\n到了5月4日，香飘飘官方微博回应：我们的员工是好样的！至此进入第二阶段。5日凌晨，有网友拍到香飘飘董事长拉着“欢迎香飘飘勇士归来！”的横幅，接机赴日回国员工。当日晚，香飘飘总裁在直播间表示，奖励“好样”的员工10万元。随之而来的，是同款果茶的销量暴涨，以及6日香飘飘的开盘涨停。\n\r\n\r\n但随着事件被质疑炒作摆拍，且有媒体向涉事日本店铺核实，被告知该店没有卖过同款杯套的奶茶，香飘飘由“泼天富贵”急转直下，销量和股价一齐大跌。截至目前，香飘飘方面没有进一步回应。\n\r\n\r\n这起事件，不论是个人行为+公司借势，还是纯粹的公司一手策划，都偏离了其所推崇的爱国情怀，传达出的价值观里也缺少对于事实的尊重。\n\r\n\r\n假设事件开端确为个人行为——个人出于爱国和环保初衷，利用工作便利，做出了“无伤大雅”且旨在提升人们环保意识的行为，尽管其“无中生有”涉事杯套涉嫌掺假，但这就像是孩子的“恶作剧”一般，或许没有必要受到过多指责。\n\r\n\r\n然而，对这一行为不批评，不代表它本身正确——毕竟这是造假，无论如何不应受到推崇。香飘飘公司对于涉事员工的高调赞赏，以及后续的跟进营销，在一定程度上，都建立在弱化真假问题的“瑕疵”之上——对员工行为没能郑重地指出问题，反而是全盘接纳、引以为傲。企业如此利益至上，轻视诚信，将商业道德与爱国情怀混为一谈，消费者自然不会持续买账。\n\r\n\r\n而假设整个事件就是一场营销策划，那么，企业就不只是纵容员工、“因势利导”的问题，而是根子正不正的问题了。爱国不是一门生意，容不得半点虚假；企业更应遵循诚信准则，不能假借爱国名义，把钱装进自己的口袋，这样不仅“不磊落”，还应受到谴责。\n\r\n\r\n对此，企业有责任澄清事实，向社会说明真相。毕竟，这已经成了公共事件。一方面消费者有知情权，另一方面爱国情怀也需要被守护，而非被辜负、被利用、被裹挟。这看似是企业如何权衡利弊的问题，但实际上，更是企业能否认清对错、辨明方向，以及向社会传达出怎样的价值观的深刻问题。显然，香飘飘应该给出更多解释。\n\r\n\r\n资深媒体人胡锡进对此发表评论称，“拿一个杯套摆拍，冒充在日本店里销售，假装‘硬杠’，这涉嫌出于商业利益欺骗国内消费者，严重有违商业道德。”\n\r\n\r\n以下为胡锡进微博评论原文。\n\r\n\r\n\r\n据媒体报道，日本相关商店没有卖过某品牌旗下的“讽日”杯套奶茶，该品牌涉嫌用“员工个人行为”的摆拍制造噱头，消费、愚弄公众的爱国情怀，非常值得商榷。\n\r\n\r\n我们堂堂正正地反对、谴责日本向大海排放核污染水，不仅外交反制，舆论也对之口诛笔伐。但是拿一个杯套摆拍，冒充在日本店里销售，假装“硬杠”，这涉嫌出于商业利益欺骗国内消费者，严重有违商业道德。\n\r\n\r\n网友们的追捧都属爱国的直抒胸臆，非常值得珍惜。摆拍者的行为没有在日本产生任何影响，假冒“硬杠”，来国内舆论场邀功，不磊落。\n\r\n\r\n说实话，这种摆拍与编造“小学生把作业本丢在巴黎”没多大区别。\n\r\n\r\n\r\n来源：综合郑州报业集团正观新闻、胡锡进微博",

          "description": "一头干练短发，一袭黑色上衣，中国互联网巨头百度副总裁璩静上周五一节假日期间在抖音上连发数条“霸总”视频，其强势刻薄的语气和不近人情的内容很快在网上炸开了锅。\n\r\n\r\n三年前加入百度担任公关副总裁、负责公众沟通工作的璩静在视频中炮语连珠：“员工（因加班和伴侣）闹分手提离职我秒批”“公关人春节周末没有假期”“我为什么要考虑员工的家庭，我又不是她婆婆……”。\n\r\n\r\n上述言论一出，立即引爆网民反弹，多个词条星期二（5月7日）登上微博热搜。百度港股当天下跌2.17%，市值蒸发超60亿港元（10.4亿新元）。璩静随后删除了抖音号上的相关视频。有关璩静已被开除的消息也甚嚣尘上。有网民调侃：竟然是“百度公关让百度陷入了一场公关危机”。\n\r\n\r\n在这场舆情危机持续发酵之际，更多线索和爆料指向璩静平时的工作风格，比视频内容有过之而无不及。她此次在短视频上翻车正是和她最近发出的一道铁令有关。\n\r\n\r\n璩静上月要求公关部全体成员进行个人短视频策划与制作，且内容要与百度相关。这项要求将与年度考核直接挂钩，如果不做就“换个地方待”。\n\r\n\r\n还有网民曝光百度公关团队名为“一指禅”的文档截图，据称收集了媒体人员家庭及个人隐私信息。“一指禅”通常指中国武术中用一只手指攻击对手的功法，但璩静在回应质疑时辩称，“一指禅”来源于英文“one page”。\n\r\n\r\n有网民星期三（5月8日）发出璩静曾因《南华早报》一篇负面报道，而把这家媒体画成纸人在办公室殴打的视频。通过其挥鞭泄愤的画面，大概也能推导出作为公关一把手的璩静日常处理媒体关系时的姿态和手法。\n\r\n\r\n重重压力下，璩静星期四（5月9日）凌晨发朋友圈道歉，称其言论不代表公司立场，并说初心是想把工作做好，但方法不当。据中国媒体报道，璩静当天晚上已经离职。\n\r\n\r\n从履历看，毕业于中国外交学院的璩静在加入百度前应是身经百战，她曾任新华社中央新闻采访中心记者，后加入中国通信巨头华为担任公共及政府事务部副总裁、中国媒体事务部部长。\n\r\n\r\n但无论是赤裸裸地宣扬把员工当工具的职场规则，还是急功近利下关注视频媒体又被流量反噬的行为，都很难想象这是一个成熟老练的公关所为。\n\r\n\r\n或许璩静忽略了，她面临的职场生态正在发生变革。和忍气吞声地将“996”加班视为常态的80后、70后不同，高喊“整顿职场”的新生代00后对工作和生活有着更明确的边界。即便眼下青年就业率走低，没有家庭包袱的00后也更敢于与企业的狼性文化果断切割。\n\r\n\r\n另一方面，璩静的东家——中国搜索引擎巨头百度曾在2016年因魏则西被医疗诈欺的事件深陷舆论漩涡，被批社会责任感缺失，公司口碑和业绩都遭到打击。\n\r\n\r\n随后百度还出现过百科编辑乱象以及泄露个人信息等负面事件，公司形象一路下滑，以至于百度创始人李彦宏2019年在一场演讲中遭遇观众泼水时，网上出现不少戏谑嘲讽声。\n\r\n\r\n如今站在人工智能赛道前沿的百度在自动驾驶、云计算等多个领域都有布局，显示欲在新一轮竞争中博得头筹的野心。璩静的公关风波对百度来说可能只是小插曲，最新信息还显示，璩静上月成立了艺人经纪相关的新公司，此次风波有自我炒作的嫌疑，但璩静事件折射出的公司文化、价值理念、用人标准，却会在一定程度上决定百度能走多远。\n\r\n\r\n稿源：联合早报",

Since Miniconda started shipping conda-libmamba-solver in July 2023, Miniforge followed suit and started shipping it too in August. At that point, since conda-libmamba-solver depends on libmambapy, the only difference between Miniforge and Mambaforge was the presence of the mamba Python package. To minimize surprises, we decided to add mamba to Miniforge too.\nShould I choose one or another going forward at the risk of one of them gettting deprecated?\nThat said, if you had to start using one today, we recommend to stick to Miniforge.",
