I created ToSNotify to automatically notify you when a website's terms change.\nA harder problem I've been thinking through is how to know which terms to track, since it'd be a pain to add every site I have an account with. One idea I had is to automatically get terms for apps you have installed from the app store.

          "description": "Hi HN,\nIf you’re selling templates or digital assets online, platforms like Gumroad have a ton of amazing features . . . but they’re also expensive. It’s not uncommon to be paying 10%, 20% or even 30% of your revenue just to host and deliver some digital content to customers.\nInstead, we think most creators should own their own Stripe account and use a lightweight fulfillment layer to send customers their orders.\nSo we built Easyful, a platform built on Stripe to email your content to customers when they buy it. And it’s free!\nWe’ve been using Easyful ourselves for a few months now. Try it out and let us know what you think!\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37054374\nPoints: 88\n# Comments: 40",

          "description": "Hi!\nAs I was working on a side project, I noticed I wanted to use SQLite like a Document Database on the server.\nSo I built Doculite. DocuLite lets you use SQLite like Firebase Firestore. It's written in Typescript and an adapter on top of sqlite3 and sqlite.\nReasons:\n1) Using an SQL Database meant having less flexibility and iterating slower.\n2) Alternative, proven Document Databases only offered client/server support.\n3) No network. Having SQLite server-side next to the application is extremely fast.\n4) Replicating Firestore's API makes it easy to use.\n5) Listeners and real-time updates enhance UX greatly.\n6) SQLite is a proven, stable, and well-liked standard. And, apparently one of the most deployed software modules right now. (src: https://www.sqlite.org/mostdeployed.html)\nWhat do you think? Feel free to comment with questions, remarks, and thoughts.\nHappy to hear them.\nThanks\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37040359\nPoints: 63\n# Comments: 29",

You describe a feature or bugfix in a GitHub issue and Sweep writes a pull request with code. You can see some examples here: https://docs.sweep.dev/examples.\nKevin and I met while working at Roblox. We talked to our friends who were junior developers and noticed a lot of them doing grunt work. We wanted to let them focus on important work. Copilot is great, but we realized some tasks could be completely offloaded to an AI (e.g. adding a banner to your webpage https://github.com/sweepai/landing-page/issues/225).\nSweep does this with a code search engine.

          "description": "Howdy! We built this as an experiment in personal-programming, combining the best of LLMs and code to help automate tasks around you. I personally use it to track the tides and get notified when certain conditions are met, something that pure LLMs had trouble dealing with and pure code was often too brittle for.\nWe created it after getting frustrated with the inability of LLMs to deal with numbers and the various hoops we had to jump through to make ChatGPT output repeatable.\nAt the core, Magic Loops are just a series of \"blocks\" (JSON) that can be triggered with different inputs (email, time, webhook), then operate on those inputs using a combination of LLMs and code, and then output those results (email, text, webhook). Under the hood, the LLM calls are using GPT-4 via OpenAI and the code is run in sandboxed (no internet) Docker containers in AWS.\nYou have full control over each step of the loop, but you can also create (or attempt to create) a Magic Loop by simply describing what you want. We use GPT-4 to break that request into feasible steps, and then create a Magic Loop scaffold. Of course, you should still validate the loop before publishing it!\nWe've seen some neat use cases already:\n- \"Text me when the tide is less than 1ft between 7am and 7pm at Fort Funston\"\n- \"Summarize an email using this format and forward it to this address\"\n- \"Text me every time our store does more than $1000/day in volume on Shopify\"\n- \"Take specific data from Cloudflare, format it, and send it to Mixpanel every hour\"\nWe hope you enjoy what's essentially an experiment at this point. If folks like the concept, we're thinking about open sourcing it so you can run the loops locally with the code runtimes you wish (rather than in our code runners).\nLet us know what you think, and more importantly, what you wish to build or automate!\nCheers,\nAdam & Mihai\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36958731\nPoints: 75\n# Comments: 13",

          "description": "TL;DR: https://pyflo.net is a free, interactive guide to learning Python\nHi Everyone, I am a CS educator who has taught a variety of university courses, including many on introductory Python programming. Over the past few years, I've written down a number of Python programming lessons and has culminated into Pyflo.net. This tool is a completely free, introductory guide to learning Python. It is more-or-less an intro programming textbook, but with a few twists, including:\n* It is totally free. You don't even have to give me your email to use it\n* The lessons are short and modularized\n* It's interactive, containing embedded questions that provide instant feedback throughout.\nMy hope is that this can be a useful resource for those looking to learn Python. Feel free to use yourself, or share with those you think would be interested.\nFeedback is very much welcome and appreciated.\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36936797\nPoints: 9\n# Comments: 0",

With Llama 2 released last week, chat models are finally good and easy enough to use on consumer hardware for the chat with docs scenario.\nKhoj is a desktop application to search and chat with your personal notes, documents and images.

We then replay these sessions on head and base commits of PRs, take screenshots at key points, and diff those screenshots to catch visual regressions before they hit production. We employ novel techniques to eliminate flakes. You can watch a 60-second demo at [meticulous.ai](http://meticulous.ai/).\nWe are a London-based YC company.

          "description": "Hi HN, we’re Mayank and Matt of Roundtable (https://roundtable.ai/). We use LLMs to produce cheap, yet surprisingly useful, simulations of surveys. Specifically, we train LLMs on standard, curated survey datasets. This approach allows us to essentially build general-purpose models of human behavior and opinion. We combine this with a nice UI that lets users easily visualize and interpret the results.\nSurveys are incredibly important for user and market research, but are expensive and take months to design, run, and analyze. By simulating responses, our users can get results in seconds and make decisions faster. See https://roundtable.ai/showcase for a bunch of examples, and https://www.loom.com/share/eb6fb27acebe48839dd561cf1546f131 for a demo video.\nOur product lets you add questions (e.g…",

          "description": "I've been watching Elon Musk's takeover of Twitter, and I've even been personally affected by it (negatively), so I wanted a way to vent using open-source software and some very basic art skills. I woke up yesterday with an idea in mind for a MAD Fold-In[1].\nA MAD Fold-In is a piece of artwork on the inside-back cover of each issue of \"MAD Magazine\". The main image can be folded to reveal a hidden, secondary image.\nI wanted to share my interactive picture with others, but printing a fold-in and mailing it to friends with instructions seemed really hard, so I searched for a digital way to do it.\nI found a blog post[2] from Thomas Park where he already did 100% of the work necessary to make a MAD Fold-In using nothing but CSS and HTML and a normal PNG image.\nUsing Inkscape and some Creative Commons images, I drafted a rough piece of artwork and tweaked it until the CSS folded it nicely.\nI wouldn't normally share here, but I think other HN readers may get some utility from seeing and trying out a purely CSS implementation of a MAD Fold-In, even if I didn't write the CSS myself. I'm hoping to start a trend where others make their own fold-ins.\nMoreover, Elon Musk picked today of all days to rebrand the Twitter logo as a unicode \"X\" character (𝕏). So, the Twitter bird really _did_ die today, as happened in my MAD fold-in, making my post somewhat topical and weirdly apropos.\nIf this post is too off-topic, please feel free to take it down. If it stays up, please let me know what you think. In the event my server goes down, I made a WayBack Machine archive of the site [3].\n[1] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mad_Fold-in\n[2] https://thomaspark.co/2020/06/the-mad-magazine-fold-in-effec...\n[3] https://web.archive.org/web/20230724221700/https://brendenhy...\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36855278\nPoints: 20\n# Comments: 4",

          "description": "Hi all! Excited to share cc.dev after months of work and refinement.\nThe idea for this product came from trying to do email marketing for my side project, CubeDesk, a site where Rubik's Cube enthusiasts can time themselves, race with one another, train algorithms — it's a fun niche!\nWith over 40k users, sending even a single campaign was becoming expensive with MailChimp. I knew AWS SES would be much cheaper, but it’s just an API with none of the other necessities you need for a robust email marketing platform.\nBeyond cost, I was also frustrated with having to make sure my database was always in sync with MailChimp and the audience schema they enforced. If I wanted to email every user who had completed 10 solves, that would be a whole ordeal and eat up hours of my day.\nSo, I started (and am now launching):\nhttps://cc.dev\ncc.dev connects directly to your database and lets you write SQL queries to target your audience. It's backed by AWS SES, so the cost to send emails is significantly less than what you're used to seeing. Combined with a template builder, media management, and campaign monitoring, cc.dev is meant to be your final destination whenever you need to send marketing emails to your users.\nWould love to hear your feedback on this! If you're interested in trying out cc.dev as your email marketing platform, shoot me an email and let's have a chat: kash at cc.dev\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36836596\nPoints: 183\n# Comments: 77",

          "description": "Hi HN\nA few folks and I have been working on this project for a couple weeks now. After previously working on the Docker project for a number of years (both on the container runtime and image registry side), the recent rise in open source language models made us think something similar needed to exist for large language models too.\nWhile not exactly the same as running linux containers, running LLMs shares quite a few of the same challenges. There are \"base layers\" (e.g. models like Llama 2), specific configuration to run correctly (parameters, temperature, context window sizes etc). There's also embeddings that a model can use at runtime to look up data – we don't support this yet but it's something we're looking at doing soon.\nIt's an early project, and there's still lots to do!\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36802582\nPoints: 142\n# Comments: 50",

That stuck and today we're trying to be that “someone” with my co-founders Thomas (design) and Charles (eng like me). Our company is called Twenty and our repo is here: https://github.com/twentyhq/twenty\nWe want to fix two issues: most CRMs aren't enjoyable to use and they often clash with engineering teams.\nYC encouraged us to launch early. What you see now is about two months' worth of feature development.

I think a big part of why Linux is becoming so popular on the desktop is because of how easy it has become to get it up and running (plug in a usb and you're good to go pretty much).\n What I worry about is that if linux reaches it's \"critical mass\" on the desktop and starts to seriously make a dent in windows' market share (the so-called year of the linux desktop), microsoft will start to take more drastic measures to ensure their hold in the market. \n This could be things like smartphone-style locked bootloaders, ensuring app/website incompatibility, or even lobbying with hardware manufacturers to ensure hardware incompatibility as well.\n It's also possible they could start locking down the UEFI as well, with things like secure boot and TPM being forcibly enabled.\n There are more possibilities as to what they could do to ensure their spot on the desktop, but these are the few I came up with.\n Of course these are all just theories I have, and I would be happy to hear any reasons why you believe they could be wrong, as this is obviously not a future I look forward to lol.\n    submitted by    /u/KCGD_r  \n [link]   [comments]",

I read mostly comments from RHEL-family distro users and US users. \n The community actually is not only composed by RHEL/Alma/Rocky/Oracle/Fedora users and many users are outside of US. Actually who uses RHEL with sub have no problem but for users/companies that uses a clone it's another thing. For example Almalinux is not morr 1:1 but try to be ABI compatible with many things to reorganized == uncertainty, Rocky follow the initial way but It could be engaged by Redhat == uncertainty, Oracle I don't know how they are managing this problem. So seems that for \"rebuilders\" there is much uncertainty. CentOS Stream for server no thank you.\n How commumity like Debian, Ubuntu, SU…",

And the only reason X has not broken for these devices so far is because its basically in maintenance mode with no one developing for it actively and contributing major changes like with Wayland.\n    submitted by    /u/drawingsvin  \n [link]   [comments]",

Among the information “struct thread_struct” holds we can include things like page fault information (like the address that caused the page fault and fault code). Also, it can include a set of registers of the current CPU — as shown in the the diagram below.\n On x86 the variable which is part of “struct task_struct” (https://medium.com/@boutnaru/linux-kernel-task-struct-829f51d97275) must be at the end of the struct. The reason for that is it contain a variable-sized structure (https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v6.5-rc4/source/include/linux/sched.h#L1544).\n Moreover, like “struct thread_info” (https://medium.com/@boutnaru/the-linux-kernel-data-structure-journey-struct-thread-info-4e70bc20d279) also “struct thread_sturct” is CPU/Architecture dependent and thus it is defined in the source code in the following location “/arch/[CPU_ARCH]/include/asm/processor.h” (https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v6.5-rc4/C/ident/thread_struct).

The project is very much still in an alpha stage, with large portions of several OpenGL versions being missing. However, it can run demoes such as glxgears and minetest with decent performance. This project isn't really an effective replacement for VirGL (except for on Windows) due to its current limitations, however it does provide some 3D acceleration in Linux and Windows guests on QEMU/KVM. It should be noted it does not provide 3D acceleration for the entire VM, but rather passes through the OpenGL calls from one process from the VM to the host for rendering.\n    submitted by    /u/dmaivel  \n [link]   [comments]",

If I recall correctly it was by actually reducing the random portion of the key, and the scheme was changed back to protect the encryption capability.The linux random number generation has been changed again. This time from using an entropy pool with a user-setable size that was used and refilled by user defined sources with /dev/random, which would block until the the random numbers were obtained, including from external hardware random number generators (HWRG) using 'rng-tools'./dev/urandom was the unblocking version of getting random numbers by other means, such as pseudo random generators (PRNG).

Now hold on I know it's pretty straight forward and not that difficult. But for me back then C syntax was a bit complicated because I had just started exploring C that semester. I did not know full syntax in C.. but luckily practical exams were being conducted on fedora that year. And I was so lucky that a month ago my friend told me about man-page. So... I used it. And oh boy the viva professor could not believe that I wrote and explained the whole program line by line with every parameter.(few of the function call did not even require all parameters.. I explained it all) The examiner looked for if a pen drive was connected to machine and thought that I have somehow cheated and copy pasted the code.. I did not tell her that I used man-page .. (well why would I ?) man-page did not cross her mind I guess.. and even if it did.. they forgot to remove it.. so it's not my fault to be honest. So I passed the exam with a B+..\n I would also like to mention that a lot of faculty did not know linux that well.. they were just bunch of windows folks who knew just Turbo C++ horrible looking editor . Can you believe they made us code in Turbo C++ in 2018.. except very few professors who encouraged students to dual boot Ubuntu/mint for learning and exploring..\n I have become fan of man-page since then and it always helped me.. what a great tool..\n Love man-page....\n And it's like a unwritten rule.. when you switch to linux you are hardly going back to windows.. ❤️\n    submitted by    /u/siddharthkulkarni98  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "First of all, I've been using Linux as my \"daily driver\" since 2001 and I've also been using Linux at work since 2010.\n  \nNot everybody gets to use Linux at work. If your company's IT department says that you must use the standard locked-down Windows image (or else), then don't try to get around that.\n If you are free to use any Linux distro, then pick one and get really good at it. Distro hopping is fine when you're at home and being a hobbyist. It is bad when you need your work machine to be available all the time.* The exception may be if you are a system administrator and need to work with many different distros/OS's (RHEL, SLES, Debian, Solaris). It will probably be a good idea to get a broader understanding of how these distros work.\n When choosing a distro to use at work, choose a mainstream distro will a good community and good documentation. Debian, Ubuntu/Mint, OpenSUSE, and Fedora fall into these categories. A cutting edge rolling distro like Arch/OpenSUSE Tumbleweed may introduce bugs that are unforeseen. You don't want to miss an important online meeting because your graphics driver no longer loads and you can't get out of the command line without doing a lot of troubleshooting.\n Reddit will tell you that you shouldn't have to learn the command line. If you expect to use Linux at work, this is not true. Learn the command line and get comfortable with fixing your own problems.\n Learn how to script. You're not a programmer? Me either! However, learning how to put together for-loops and other constructs in Bash will save you hours of work.\n  \nI'll leave this open for anyone else to give their own tips.\n    submitted by    /u/Capitan_Picard  \n [link]   [comments]",

It's an attempt to give back to community.\n Introducing privacy.sexy, – a free, open-source, non-commercial (I lose money on this) project I built during my spare time, designed to provide privacy protection on desktops and servers with 127 scripts for Linux. And I'm looking to your feedback and improvement suggestions.\n In summary, it tries to disable or clear as much identifiable data as possible to enhance privacy and prevent tracking. It selectively cleans personal data, turns off default data collection in various Linux distributions and packages, and adjusts third-party application settings to enhance data security and privacy. The initial scripts are mainly designed for desktop users.\n Here are a few highlights of the Linux support that sets privacy.sexy apart from other Linux-based privacy-focused projects:\n  \nFactual and in-depth documentation with sources.\n Full support for Flatpak and Snap installations to harden and cleanup software, addressing the needs of modern Linux desktop users. This is an area where renowned tools like BleachBit are currently falling short.\n Built with a focus on the needs of modern Linux distribution (most of the resources I've seen online for desktop users were outdated).\n  \nLinux support is currently in preview, and far away from being a complete, I invite you to check it out and share your feedback with me. It's a community-driven project and improved based on community feedback. Your suggestions will shape the tool to better suit the needs of Linux users everywhere.\n  \nWebsite: https://privacy.sexy\n Offline desktop version (AppImage): privacy.sexy-0.12.0.AppImage\n Source code: GitHub\n  \n(⚠️ Disclaimer: I am the maintainer of privacy.sexy, sharing this here in the spirit of openness and collaboration)\n    submitted by    /u/privacysexy  \n [link]   [comments]",

However recently I gave Gentoo a go on bare metal and after a couple of false starts got everything running well with Nvidia and Intel GPU's. Took about 4 hours roughly to get to a fully stocked KDE desktop, not bad when I compiled the whole things on 4 year old laptop (40 minutes of that was QTWebkit which is a known beast of package, so time could be trimmed down).\n Overall its been very stable and easy to use, I've been using the SystemD version as that's what I'm used to, there is their own init system called openRC that is their default. If you can do Arch you can do Gentoo for sure, the wiki is very good and is on a par with the Arch wiki for its quality of content. Once you understand the concept of USE flags in the main make.conf the rest of Gentoo comes together easily. Once upon a time Gentoo was compiled for speed, these days the speed increase is negligible its more about crafting a system that only has the stuff you need. Don't have bluetooth? disable the use flag and don't build packages with it as dependency. It's a very interesting and I found it rewarding distro.\n Don't be afraid and give it a go. You might just have some fun.\n Edit: I forgot to mention that's it's rolling too!\n https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Handbook:Main_Page\n https://www.gentoo.org/downloads/\n https://packages.gentoo.org/\n    submitted by    /u/thewrinklyninja  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Just over twelve years ago (April 9th, 2011 to be precise), PJ stopped updating the incomparable Groklaw legal blog. This was the site that did for IT legal issues what Linux did for open source. Many won't remember, but in the period between 2003 and 2010 Linux was under serious threat from a company called SCO (formerly Santa Crux Operation). SCO claimed ownership of Linux over extremely dubious copyright claims. Groklaw started up about then and started covering the legal battle. PJ was soon joined by an army of legal experts and IT professionals and basically shredded every filing that SCO made. In an odd twist, IBM led the fight supporting Linux against SCO and eventually prevailed. Groklaw's influence over the legal proceedings cannot be overstated.\n PJ cited privacy concerns for the decision to cease updating Groklaw, but she announced that Bruce Webbink would take over the reins with Groklaw 2.0. Since then, crickets.\n I first ran into Groklaw before it became a standalone web site and it immediately became my go-to site to read over my morning coffee. I still miss it terribly :( \n    submitted by    /u/PiscadorQ  \n [link]   [comments]",

That said, is there a way to query a Linux device for its flavor/version of Linux without needing any special credentials (e.g., Debian, Fedora, Ubuntu.)? We have several Linux-based devices on our network by way of third-party vendors who use Linux as the base OS. Not critical but it would be nice to confirm what the base OS is that the vendor adopted for their solution as a way to keep up on security updates. Obviously, the updates would come from the vendor, not directly from Linux, but being aware that Linux has updates to install would remind us to check with the vendor to see if they are addressing any recent vulnerabilities.

Almost one year ago I've set up a dual-boot of openSUSE Leap 15.4 along with Windows 11, but since then I haven't really used it. Things like gaming, Windows-exclusive software and the fact that I'm not the only one using this PC and the other person is very used to Windows have been holding me back. But now I've started to realize, that Linux has all I need, really. After all, there's always the other drive with Windows that I won't be ditching in the foreseeable future, so I can reboot into it at any moment.\n Today I tried replicating my bizarre partition setup in a VM and then updating Leap 15.4 to Tumbleweed, and it worked, I guess. I want to do the same on my PC tomorrow. After that I'll be messing around for a few days, configuring and setting up stuff.\n Do you have any tips for a Linux newbie? The main things I do on my PC are gaming (just a few games though) and programming (which is one of the main reasons I'm switching). I also feel like I have to mention that I have an NVIDIA GPU (1050 Ti), and last time I checked the Nvidia drivers package that I got from openSUSE Wiki was version 4xx somehing.

From what I've read so far, the reason why most banks don't want to overhaul their ATM's boils down to something pretty simple: cost. Estimates I've seen are usually around $1000-$3500 because apparently it means that they have to replace the all of the computer hardware as well?\n Now, I've had first hand experience with how troublesome ATM's can be nowadays. I've had one ATM run an update and crash on me afterwards WHILE I am still in the middle of a transaction. I've had to go into the bank and get one of their technicians or IT staff to fix the problem or they just give me my money and go about business. Not only that, I have also experienced numerous transaction delays because of these updates downloading at the worst time possible. This is not to mention the potential security vulnerabilities as some are STILL running older versions of Windows, especially in rural areas where the tech/online banking infrastructure isn't nearly as refined because of lack of funding/market interest.\n What's the story behind this?

I've tried out various operating systems like Pop!_OS, Fedora Workstation, Arch Linux, Nobara, and I've had problems in all of them.\n They're not major problems that make them impossible to use, but rather paper cuts. Sometimes it's small things like sudo taking seconds before prompting for a password, default audio devices resetting to something else, random system freezes that last seconds, and so on. But eventually, these paper cuts add up and can kill. While these issues alone weren't enough to force me off Linux, they added up enough that it made me swit…",

At that time my SSD broke and I bought a new one, logically without Windows. At that time I didn't know how to install Windows with a USB-stick, so I was only left with Linux. I liked Linux Mint, but I didn't liked the look of it that much. Ubuntu has Snap, which I unfortunately didn't know about at the time because I was a typical beginner. When I figured out how to install Windows from a stick, I did it. I regret it, I should have focused on Linux instead. For some time now I've been wanting to switch to Linux again.

The name of the kernel thread is in the pattern of “dmcrypt_write/%s”, where the added string represents the device name.\n Overall, “dm-crypt” is a device-mapper target (https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v6.5-rc3/source/drivers/md/dm-crypt.c#L3689) supported from kernel version 2.6.4 (https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v2.6.4/source/drivers/md/dm-crypt.c). It is responsible for transparent (aka real-time/on-the-fly encryption) block device encryption while using the kernel crypto API (https://gitlab.com/cryptsetup/cryptsetup/-/wikis/DMCrypt) .\n This means the data is encrypted/decrypted while it is read/written. To enable the “dm-crypt” support we need to enable “CONFIG_DM_CRYPT” in the compilation config of the kernel (https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v6.5-rc3/source/drivers/md/Makefile#L59).\n Moreover, the function that is executed as part of the kernel thread is “dmcrypt_write” function (https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v6.5-rc3/source/drivers/md/dm-crypt.c#L1922). This function is part of the kernel module “dm_crypt” — as shown in the screenshot below. We can use “modinfo dm_crypt” for more information, also shown in the screenshot below.\n ​\n https://preview.redd.it/3yqil6zzvbfb1.png?width=777&format=png&auto=webp&s=f6e2c1ce7476211fe191b85d0af490b8b28c5a70\n    submitted by    /u/boutnaru  \n [link]   [comments]",

I am looking for a second laptop for studying and working but I am not sure which model would be a good choice for my budget as a second-hand laptop (around 200£). I am also not sure what tools I might need in the future, on the cybersecurity domain. I don’t really care too much about the display as I won’t take it out the house too much and also I don’t want it to be a beast on performance, just to serve well for at least 2 years from now and to fit around my budget. 🤔 I was looking for Lenovo x1 Carbon, Dell latitudine or ThinkPad T460+ or even the ThinkPads X series.

On the exam day, I organised myself not to have anyone else at home so no distractions and perfect internet, all for myself.\n My internet speed test was over 100Mbps. I checked all system requirements the day prior to the exam.\n My exam didn’t start. I would suddenly receive a message that my bandwidth was below the minimum (300kbps) and the screen would close. \n I tried the same multiple times, restarted my computer, advised my exam supervisor via chat (never got a response) and couldn’t take the test. \n I tried to contact support immediately, but I just received a message two days later saying they were sorry for my internet (!!!) and gave me one more exam attempt and extended my voucher in 15 days. \n I was definitely not comfortable with that situation and tried to request additional assistance, as I was afraid that would happen again. Despite my attempts to investigate the issue, I was ignored. \n So, with no other options, I’ve sit for the exam again and the same error happened. \n I asked for a reimbursement, but they refuse to give me. They said I have an internet issue and wanted to extend my voucher again! \n I refuse to sit for this exam a third time, especially when I know the error will happen again. This is very disrespectful to me. \n I am not taking this exam at this stage, as I wouldn’t feel proud to add this Linux Foundation badge to my resume (again, as I already have your CKAD certification, along with 5 others). \n    submitted by    /u/ThaisMayumi  \n [link]   [comments]",

I have never really jumped into installing apps/programs through the terminal though. But just to joke around I wanted to see if I could use OBS on it through linux which installed and opened just fine. Though I have a plug in that I have installed on my windows PC no problem. But as for the linux side of it I have no clue how to do that. I have what a I believe is the plugin file being that its a .so file. Thought I would jump on reddit and see if anyone would be up to help me out with this and maybe teach me a few things along the way.\n    submitted by    /u/FinchHD  \n [link]   [comments]",

I’ve been using it as an eReader and it’s been okay for this, but the little annoyances are piling up: PDFs keep disappearing, it’s an absolute pain trying to add books to, or transfer them from, Apple’s Books app, the need for specialized apps on computer and device just to try to access files, and I’m tired of being tied to iCloud. \n Long story short, I’d love to be able to rip iOS from the iPad and replace it with a Linux distro…..but from what I’ve seen online, it’s not that easy. Has anyone had any success with replacing iOS with Linux (preferably Debian-based)? Are there any distro’s that work well on tablets? I’ve seen YouTube videos where people attach a Raspberry Pi to the iPad and use VNC to “run” Linux, does anyone have experience with this? I’m not just looking to run a Linux-like terminal on iPad or jailbreak it to access different features - I want to look at replacing the actual operating system completely if possible, before considering the more costly alternative of replacing the device. \n What I’m looking to achieve:\n  \nEasier file transfer between PC and device, with files being easily located in a file manager on the PC side. If I could just create a directory on the device for eBooks, and add/remove/read books via that directory, that would be perfect!\n \nWide range of formats (pdf, epub, txt, cbr, etc) readable\n \nTouchscreen compatibility \n \nAs with Linux, a high degree of control over the device\n \n    submitted by    /u/TryingToAdult1600  \n [link]   [comments]",

Basically, it is the implementation of the OMM (Out–of-Memory) killer function of the Linux kernel.\n The function which is executed by the thread is “oom_reaper” (https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v6.2.5/source/mm/oom_kill.c#L640) which calls “oom_reap_task” (https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v6.2.5/source/mm/oom_kill.c#L609).\n Based on the documentation the goal of the “oom_reaper” kernel thread is to try and reap the memory used by the OOM victim (https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v6.2.5/source/mm/oom_kill.c#L504). “oom_reaper” sleeps until it is waked up (https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v6.2.5/source/mm/oom_kill.c#L680) which is after OOM kills the process.\n After killing the process the victim is queued so the “oom_reaper” can release the resources (https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v6.2.5/source/mm/oom_kill.c#L992). You can see an example of the log created by OOM after killing a process.\n ​\n https://blog.capdata.fr/index.php/linux-out-of-memory-killer-oom-killer-pour-un-serveur-base-de-donnees-postgresql/\n    submitted by    /u/boutnaru  \n [link]   [comments]",

It seems like Zig is the modern C and Rust is the modern C++; I don't understand why Linus would approve Rust but not Zig (at least yet) if he likes C better than C++.\n At some point, LLVM will be rewritten, too; either that or the world will just move to something better (which probably gets bootstrapped from LLVM on v1). Only then can we fully and truly get rid of C/++ in the world, which needs to be done just on the basis of how much time and money goes into debugging it.\n These things should also be verifiable against some spec with Agda, IMO; it's the most important software in the world we're talking about here.\n    submitted by    /u/tldrthestoryofmylife  \n [link]   [comments]",

The last printed message is \"Authenticating with public key \"....\" from agent\".\n When I right click on the terminal window and press on \"duplicate session\", another frozen window opens. Basically I can't do anything.\n The SSH tunnel is correctly established and can be used by other applications (e.g. RemoteDesktop). In this way everything works and I can work on remote server.\n Problem: I'm now trying to do the same with a LINUX server. The same happens with Putty - a locked terminal is opened. In this case, RemoteDesktop doesn't work, as it only works for Windows.\n Questions:\n - How can I solve this problem? I can imagine there are softwares like RemoteDesktop that allows you to connect to a Linux server? Or there are some settings in Putty that avoid the opened window to be freezed? (or maybe is some corporate policy?)\n - How can I open another terminal and connect to the server with the CLI using the existing SSH tunnel? \n    submitted by    /u/Character-Article380  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I don't get why canonical projects fail to get public support, love and traction like Ubuntu. They tried to improve the linux init with Upstart. In Mir they tried to improve Display stack. In Snap they tried to improve binary distribution problem. They made the effort to push the linux desktop. Still, even being first with a working solution their solutions do not get community approval to the extent Redhat does. Redhat's systemd came after Upstart and took over linux land. Wayland came after MIR and is still not as usable as MIR and Unity were. \n I think quite contrary to others i believe these innovations were incremental and not breaking the norm hence were not readily accepted whereas redhats solutions went to the last mile and people had to adopt. It also highlights why fragmentation is a good thing contrary to the popular opinion.\n    submitted by    /u/Own_Language7325  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I have an environment with a RHEL 8.8 Linux server directly connected to a JBOD via SAS. All the hardware is Supermicro and the storage controllers are modern LSI/Avago/Broadcom and running the latest firmware. The JBOD is configured with 2 types of disks (HDD & SSD).\n In the front of the JBOD there are 24 large (18 TB) WD 7200 RPM datacenter SAS disks and in the back are 20 large (6.4 TB) Seagate Nytro 3235 SAS SSD's. When testing IOPS using IOZONE, the HDD's perform reasonably well, but the IOPS for the SSD's are abysmal.\n So, I decided to put the storage controller in passthrough mode and let ZFS manage the storage. Again, the HDD's are outperforming the SSD's by orders of magnitude across every block size.\n Bewildered, I swapped out the Linux OS disks and installed the latest version of TrueNAS core and now the SSD's are performing more in line with expectations. Debian based TrueNAS Scale is also providing decent results (but not quite as good as the FreeBSD version).\n We're a RHEL Linux shop and would prefer to run everything on RHEL 8 or 9, but if the performance isn't there, then obviously we need to look elsewhere (IXsystems, Netapp, etc.). Unfortunately, we're on a shoestring budget, so rolling our own solutions is often the order of the day.\n Any ideas for why Redhat would perform so badly compared to the FreeBSD and Debian versions of TrueNAS?\n    submitted by    /u/mission-implausable  \n [link]   [comments]",

But to no one's surprise, ArchWiki is one of the few places recommending the native driver.\n And apparently the new driver is not being maintained? - https://www.theregister.com/2022/04/29/problems_for_the_linux_kernel_ntfs/\n this old lkml thread claims ntfs-3g is actually faster - https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/alpine.DEB.2.20.2109030047330.23375@tuxera.com/.

          "description": "First of all, I know there's a lot of work to be done on HDR but I just want to understand some things about HDR in general and also how it will likely work on Linux.\n 1 . It seems that when using a HDR monitor with SDR content, things can look bad (too much saturation, incorrect colors, washed out etc.) and this isn't Linux specific either. So what people do is limit their monitor to the sRGB color space with some kind of sRGB Emulation mode to work around this issue.\n This is obviously useful for SDR content but now you've just made HDR content look worse, right? So in this situation, is there even any point in having a HDR monitor if you're just going to limit the color space like that? I don't get it..\n 2 . I think Windows can possibly send a signal to the monitor to enable/disable HDR functionality depending on the content being displayed (Not sure on this). Can this/will this be done on Linux?\n 3 . I hear talk of mixed SDR & HDR content being handled on the screen at once. I have no idea how Windows handles this. Again, is this something Linux can/will do?\n Additionally, I'm considering getting a HDR monitor but I'm not a fan of changing monitor settings depending on what I'm doing - I just like to set & forget. Am I going to have to chose between bad looking SDR with HDR enabled or good looking SDR with HDR disabled/severely limited, or can I have the best of both with one setting?\n Thank you.\n    submitted by    /u/LinuxGamer100  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Over the last few weeks I've been seeing a frankly concerning amount of questions about Wubuntu and LinuxFX/WindowsFX. First of all, something that many people seem unaware of is that these are actually the same thing. LinuxFX rebranded to Wubuntu, presumably to evade their history of terrible security practices.\n For those unaware of the story of LinuxFX, it was a skinned version of KDE that was designed to mimic Windows as closely as possible. And unfortunately they didn't just stop at making it look like Windows, as they sell activation licenses for \"pro\" version of their OS. All of these licenses were stored on a database that was incredibly easy to breach, and leaked a ton of user information, including user IP addresses. The initial discovery of this was reported here: https://kernal.eu/posts/linuxfx/\n When the news about this became more widespread, they decided to increase their security... by moving the openly accessible database to a different URL. Naturally this was nearly immediately breached again: https://kernal.eu/posts/linuxfx-part-2/\n What's more awful is that the old URL for the database got replaced by a plaintext file, containing the lines \"kernalisdumb\" and \"kernalislammer\" (yes they did even misspell the word \"lamer\"). This weak attempt at insulting the people who have genuine concern for user safety really speaks volumes about the neglect of the LinuxFX developers.\n In fact, the URL for the old database is still online: http://www.linuxfx.org/linuxfx/x86/11.1/.http\n What's even more concerning now is that the aforementioned insults have been replaced again with \"linux896_hacked\", which raises the concern for me that LinuxFX is entirely compromised.\n The idea of a Linux distribution that is familiar to Windows users is enticing, and I see why people are interested in it, but I want everyone to be aware of the dangers that come with Wubuntu/LinuxFX/WindowsFX.\n    submitted by    /u/fox_in_unix_socks  \n [link]   [comments]",

I had RHCSA in Nov and well I thought my Company was actually going to move to use RHEL a couple of months ago since they reach out for me to create an account with them, but I'm now sure it was just due to getting a discount for a client's project we had (work at an MSP). \n So I thought of creating Projects for myself, which if you guys have anything interesting to recommend I'm open to them. then again maybe I'm better off doing something more meaningful.

          "description": "If you're a Linux + Thunderbird user, you're most likely concerned about privacy and security and so have setup your e-mail client to only show plain text e-mails by default. Sometimes however, there are e-mails that require you to enable HTML (or at least \"simple\" HTML) to make sense of the contents. If you've gotten such an e-mail, you'd always have to change the global setting via the View menu and then change it back once you've read the e-mail. This is, of course, a bit annoying.\n To circumvent this, in the past you could always make use of the \"Allow HTML temp\" add-on, that provided a one-click method of changing the view mode just for the currently shown e-mail. Unfortunately this add-on does not work anymore since the release of Thunderbird 105. I saw that there was already a feature request for this on Mozilla Connect, but it doesn't have very many votes and is therefore far down the list (and as I understand it, feature requests with more votes are prioritized by the devs).\n That's why I want to ask you to please support this feature request with a vote, so that we may once again enjoy the great Thunderbird with the desired privacy, security and convenience.

          "description": "I posted this on /r/pcbuildhelp but didn't get any bites, so I'm posting here. Hope that's okay.\n This is a weird one. I'm pretty experienced with building PCs, and am also pretty experienced with Linux, but I've never run into this before.\n I'm building a duplicate, part-for-part, of a previous build. The previous build is a NAS running Ubuntu 22.04 LTS, and the new build is intended to be the same, built for a friend. My NAS is great and has given me zero issues, which is why I decided to use the exact same parts again. I specifically chose Ubuntu 22.04 because it's one of the few Linux installers that allows you to install straight to ZFS, which I prefer to use on NAS builds.\n I made a USB installer of Ubuntu 22.04, selected it as the boot device, selected \"try or install Ubuntu,\" and upon the Ubuntu splash screen with a spinning wheel, the wheel spins for a bit and then stops -- the installer freezes and never recovers. I tried safe graphics, and the same thing happened.\n Thinking the problem was the USB drive, I tested the installer on a spare machine, and Ubuntu installed flawlessly.\n I went ahead and wiped the USB drive and added a Debian 11 installer. Same issue as before. Ditto with TrueNAS. Ditto with multiple other distros.\n I've tried other USB drives just in case. I've tried going full UEFI, full legacy/BIOS only, etc. I've updated the BIOS. I've run a memtest for 24 hours with no issues, re-seated the CPU, swapped the GPU, tried editing the GRUB options, and the issue persists.\n At this point it's pretty clearly a hardware issue, but I'm not sure how to troubleshoot whether the problem lies with the motherboard or CPU. Unfortunately the CPU is a Xeon and doesn't have onboard graphics so I can't totally remove a discrete GPU from the equation altogether. I also don't have any spare parts to swap out, unless I take apart my personal NAS, which I'd really prefer to not have to do...\n Any thoughts on where to go from here would be super appreciated!\n    submitted by    /u/rewgs  \n [link]   [comments]",

This also means less energy burnt on unnecessary CPU cycles, which makes Lightwhale an excellent choice for sustainable and green-tech efforts.\n Your home lab will love Lightwhale, and probably your business' on-prem enterprise edge-computing server thing too.\n Give it a try, that would be cool.

          "description": "So with all the kerfuffle over RHEL and me being a long time Fedora user, I decided to give Ubuntu a spin with their new SNAP package management system instead Flatpak and was pretty underwhelmed. It seemed every SNAP I needed to install was only able to do so in \"classic\" mode, which if I'm reading the documentation correctly, does not confine the installed packages within a sandbox as what I'm led to believe the whole SNAP / Flatpak philosophy was all about.\n Anyway, I'm about to throw in the towel on Ubuntu and maybe try Arch out or just go back to Fedora and Flatpaks unless I'm just completely missing something with SNAPs?\n    submitted by    /u/floppy_panoos  \n [link]   [comments]",

It’s an i586 based CPU (yes, i586, it’s not a typo). \n I’ve tried booting LXLE Linux but that just told me I need to use a kernel matching my architecture. \n After that I tried DamnSmallLinux (DSL) which boots successfully! Even the touchscreen does something, but just not what I am expecting. I click on the middle of the screen and the mouse moves to the top right of the screen. It needs some form of calibration.\n Can anyone point me into the right direction on how I can calibrate the touchscreen in DSL or recommend any other OS for the i586 architecture where the touchscreen might work better?\n I don’t have much information on the device. The touchscreen works via VGA and serial. It’s an AMD Genode CPU with 500 MHz and 256MB RAM (lol).\n    submitted by    /u/2_CLICK  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hi 1st of all. Despite being distro hopping for more than 4 years on Linux (always on intel) and never really sticks to it due to previous workplace requirement on running windows specifics softwares, I'm still very VERY ultra noob when it comes to Linux. So If my questions sounds really stupid, please direct me what to look in order to learn.\n I've recently bought an Asus TUF A15 with Ryzen 7 4800H + RTX 3050 Ti combo. After a week of using it, I have the board fried after running Linux on VM while installing Visual studio in Windows. (My very first time to decide on AMD, had no idea when I jumped in lol)\n The store where I bought it gave me a new unit replacement since it happened on the 6th day after my purchase. (Something about Asus policy saved my ass)\n My question are. I would like to install Linux on this laptop. I've had my success on MSI GF75 Thin 9SC (intel) in controlling my fan speed.\n But for the Asus TUF A15, I understood that AMD SMU are controlling the fan and no way to control them manualy? (Correct me if I'm wrong). (Oh and theres no way to manualy control this in windows too)\n So given my experience on the Asus TUF A15, if I would just swing it and install Linux. Will it cause problems like getting my laptop board fried again? To be honest I can't afford another laptop anymore. 🤣🤣🤣\n I tried installing Mint and Pop OS on a second nvme, everything seems to work for me, nothing I wasn't able to google and fix. However, my concern was the fan/heat. As on my MSI, I would run my python script and it would be hot and I'll just turn my fan to boost mode. I'm afraid to test this on the Asus TBH.\n Man, I hope im not getting roast for this, kinda stupid question 😅\n    submitted by    /u/Sleepy_N_Walking  \n [link]   [comments]",

This'll be called the UHP Open Standard and will run on Windows, Mac and Linux. It'll also be built into Tectonic Marketplace, which will be a Chromium based app meant to allow the user to download and run UHPs. The user can also drag 3rd party UHP files into the app and install them. \n We need people that are familiar with: - the Chromium codebase (!!!) - GTK theming - making Debian applications - basic web development (HTML, CSS, JS)\n If you're interested, get in touch with me either here or on Discord. My username is @kantraa. We can discuss this further if you want and I will add you to our development group. This project is 100% non-profit, so because of that and other things right now there won't be any pay unfortunately.

It returns the output in a JSON format, thus enabling users to parse it according to their liking or forward it to any other tool for further processing.\n In short, BucketLoot has the following features: 1. Scan for secret exposures 2. Extract assets such as URLs, Subdomains and Domains 3. Search for custom keywords or regex queries \n The tool can help people like bug hunters and penetration testing folks to step up their recon game and go beyond the traditional tools available in the market.\n In case you would like to know more about BucketLoot, make sure to head over to our blog @ RedHunt Labs which gives a brief walkthrough of the tool: https://redhuntlabs.com/blog/introducing-bucketloot-an-automated-cloud-bucket-inspector/\n    submitted by    /u/0x9747  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "VFS (Virtual File System, aka Virtual File Switch) is a software component of Linux which is responsible for the filesystem interface exposed to user-mode applications. Using it allows the kernel to provide an abstraction layer that makes implementation of different filesystems very easy (https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/next/filesystems/vfs.html).\n Overall, VFS is masking the implementation details of a specific filesystem behind generic system calls (open/read/write/close/etc), which are mostly exposed to user-mode application by some wrappers in libc — as shown in the diagram below (https://www.starlab.io/blog/introduction-to-the-linux-virtual-filesystem-vfs-part-i-a-high-level-tour).\n Moreover, we can say that the main goal of VFS is to allow user-mode applications to access different filesystems (think about NTFS, FAT, etc.) in the same way. There are four main objects in VFS: superblock, dentries, inodes and files (https://www.win.tue.nl/~aeb/linux/lk/lk-8.html).\n Thus, “inode” (https://medium.com/@boutnaru/linux-what-is-an-inode-7ba47a519940) is what the kernel uses to keep track of files. Because a file can have several names there are “dentries” (“directory entries”) which represent pathnames. Also, due to the fact a couple of processes can have the same file opened (for read/write) there is a “file” structure that holds the information for each one (such as the cursor position). The “superblock” structure holds data which is needed for performing actions on the filesystem — more details about all of those and more (like mounting) are going to be published in the near future.\n Lastly, there are also other relevant data structures that I will post on in the near future (“filesystem”, “vfsmount”, “nameidata” and “address_space”).\n ​\n https://www.starlab.io/blog/introduction-to-the-linux-virtual-filesystem-vfs-part-i-a-high-level-tour\n    submitted by    /u/boutnaru  \n [link]   [comments]",

I bought a 360 camera like a year ago and immediately became annoyed that I couldn't do anything with it unless i logged into windows, so i haven't used it hoping Linux will soon enough start doing 360 video.\n Yesterday for my first time in many months I turned on my Quest2 vr headset, but once again for like the 3rd time it requires me to create an acount, wtf i'm so sick of this thing, i want to just get rid of it, but i'm holding onto it in hopes that some sort of linux hack or OS comes out for it.\n I would love a Linux phone, are those still happening?\n    submitted by    /u/ThunderNegro420  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Many are no doubt familiar with the venerable XScreensaver package from JWZ. I've used it for years, nearly decades since first getting X to run in the late 1996 time frame. Unfortunately, with Wayland XScreensaver doesn't work so well and for that I don't blame the package as it simply is not implemented for Wayland in any manner.\n Don't get me wrong, there is something to be said for a system going into a semi-sleep mode when GNOME blanks the screen and the system becomes idle and the internal temperature is lowered by a lot. It is quite useful but also quite boring, and yes, I am aware of the goal of saving power for various reasons. Still, though, I've been entertained over the years by the sheer multitude of screen savers included in the package and enjoy watching them cycle along every few minutes or so. I also don't mind if the screen saver package blanks the screen after a half hour or so (user configurable, of course). At least with a screen saver I know my system hasn't crashed!\n Perhaps the limitation is technical and Wayland doesn't have the API that would permit a screen saver to work as it can on X. I simply don't know.\n    submitted by    /u/N0NB  \n [link]   [comments]",

Sadly, in the past year I've been experiencing a lot of small problems when updating my system (I use arch by the way, and before you blame that, keep in mind keeping things up to date with upstream is not beta, those project I assume test to the best of their abilities). Anyway, for example here are some issues I've had:\n - gtk issues (e.g. file chooser widget crash), that got patched a few days later.\n - SDL 2 crash on fullscreen issues, that got patched a few weeks later\n More recently:\n - Steam did a big update on their desktop ui and now I have to hold ctrl when mouse clicking widgets. Super annoying.\n - Anything going fullscreen is now having hiccups.\n So I googled what desktop environment steam deck uses, figuring that at least will get tested. So I installed kde-plasma-x11. The steam ctrl workaround is not necessary under that DE. And fullscreen doesn't hiccup. But I hate plasma. Everything is super slow to launch (i.e. 2 seconds). Worst, installing kde screwed up my configs and openbox is ugly now, and tracker3 is misbehaving so openging nautilus in openbox takes 10 seconds. I don't want to fix that issue because Steam and fullscreen still misbehave at the time of writing when I use openbox.\n I thought openbox was super stable, and the whole point of it was an exercice in writing a X11 compliant window manager. Is KDE full of non standard hack, which is why it works well while openbox doesn't? Or is there bugs in openbox that just will never get fixed and I should ditch it. Anyway. I know, this is a rant now. But my computer was running nice under it, and now it's not enjoyable under kde. I would try wayland to see, but for some reason it doesn't launch.\n    submitted by    /u/fluxrider  \n [link]   [comments]",

After updating some of the python2 scripts to python3, a brutal series of C compilation errors started coming. After some of those bugs were fixed, feels like it would help if I could just upgrade to the latest LTS 6.1.\n As a newbie, I directly merged the tag with my kernel and that was a disaster. There have been a lot of changes between and so I went back to fixing the old bugs for now. That made me wonder if there is a optimum way to upgrade old kernels without creating new bugs that would give me migraine.\n If you guys have any insights or experience on this please share.

When I use HDMI, the correct aspect ratio doesn't even show up let alone correct resolution. \n I've also tried using this docking station that uses DisplayLink (https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00O0M46KO?psc=1&ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_details) and connected via display port instead of HDMI.

          "description": "For the curious newbies out there:\n Repositories are one of the essential part of a distribution. Still, they are the most obscure knowledge piece about it. As far as i know Arch Linux with its official repositories and AUR has one of the largest package base leaving aside NixOS which is different on its own and is its own league. Debian boasts one of the largest official binary package database. Ubuntu hosts its own repositories and PopOS which is based on Ubuntu its seems is hosting its own repositories too. Fedora also has official as well as community repositories but its package collection is rather smaller than others.\n Flatpak, Snap, AppImage transcends the Distro packaging scheme and are standalone application pacakagers. They are their own base and are distroindependent. I don't know package count on them as they can be pretty susceptible to spaming. They also solve binary distribution problem for proprietary vendors and add useful features like sandboxing and portals generally enhancing the supposed security of the system. \n    submitted by    /u/Own_Language7325  \n [link]   [comments]",

I know this is not r/linuxquestions(!), but to me this is less of a how a 'how do I solve this specific technical problem' question, and more of a 'what the heck is even going on these days in the bigger picture' sort of question.\n    submitted by    /u/H663  \n [link]   [comments]",

I’m forced to use windows as a scientific workstation on my work computer as a government data scientist and I completely understand why, and I have no expectations that Linux will “win on the desktop”, because it doesn’t need to.\n Despite so many Linux fans out there thinking really hard /s about how the community can best strategize to have a completely open hardware and software platform take over households across the world, in all use cases, especially the ones the Linux kernel is least suited for (like RTOS applications directing self driving cars, and, no the driving subsystems of Tesla don’t run on linux, the infotainment system does), we still have really nice linux things!\n On my desktop, I can run hyprland basically flawlessly with my 3070 using proprietary nvidia drivers. I just got a steam deck and now I can play all of my favorite video games on my couch in 4K on my big ol TV with a wireless controller. I still use a pretty locked down andoid phone for many things (though an iPhone for daily use because privacy). I have a raspberry pi to serve as the data collection backend for my home brewed weather station. My TV and both of my partners TVs have Linux as their smart TV OS.\n All of these things are a mix of GPLed software and binary blobs/closed source elements. It’s amazing just how robust the corporate environment for Linux really is and how it drives innovation and competition.\n And Debian is also a thing, I guess. Kinda.\n The truly best thing about Linux is how all the really serious developers aren’t ESR or RMS. They’re actually rational, successful people. The zealots lost the argument and we’re all better for it.\n It’s nice to have nice things.\n    submitted by    /u/sp0rk173  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Ever since I started seriously using Linux a few years ago, I always used Wayland. I really liked Fedora, so I used GNOME on Wayland, I also tried using KDE for a while, but that was also on Wayland. Overall, I barely touched Xorg during this entire time. I tried booting GNOME on Xorg but my touchpad gestures stopped working, so I immediately turned it off. Why bother with it if it's the outdated display server?\n Through my Linux experience, I discovered many issues - I desperately needed fractional scaling on my 14 inch 1080p laptop, which was always a blurry nightmare and I never managed to make it usable. I also experienced some visual glitches, like windows disappearing on GNOME with multiple monitors, etc. and I always figured that that's just what the Linux experience is like.\n Fast forward to a few days ago, when I installed Arch with the i3 window manager, the first environment running on Xorg that I've seriously used. And wow. So many issues are just gone, or at least very solvable. None of my apps are blurry with fractional scaling. Everything is smooth and looks good. It's like a different world.\n Wayland has some very cool features, like the responsive touchpad gestures, and it's definitely great for the future of Linux. As of now, if you're also bothered by the issues I was, consider giving them up for a way smoother and reliable desktop experience.\n    submitted by    /u/azdrawee  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I see many people talking about choosing the right hardware to run Linux and I always thought there were exaggerating. I was so wrong.\n Recently I decided to build a new PC and since I was using Linux on my laptop I thought \"Well, if I am building a new machine why not make it fully compatible with Linux?\"\n So I did it. Every single part of my build has good support for Linux. AMD Ryzen, ATI Radeon, etc., etc... I could not be happier. Everything works just as it was supposed to. I am running Fedora with Wayland and it has been an amazing experience.\n Newcomers to Linux should know that: If you just bought your PC it probably was designed to run Windows or MAC. Most companies do not care about Linux (yes, I am talking to you Nvdia). It does not mean that it won't run Linux, it just means that it has a great chance of not being a good experience and random problems will happen. Everything on Linux was made by people who dedicate some of their time to making things work because companies do not. They do an amazing job, but it is not the same as having all info necessary. Sure, your system can run very well, but it will never be as good as a well-thought Linux-compatible PC.\n You do not have to build one. Just find a company that sells laptops for example with full Linux support and you will be amazed by how good it is .\n ​\n TL;DR: To get the whole Linux experience you have to care about hardware as well. \n    submitted by    /u/colutti  \n [link]   [comments]",

I tried it a couple months ago on KDE with my Nvidia card, and surprisingly it ran pretty well and was much smoother than X11, a few minor graphical glitches aside. \n What concerns me is that there's so many conflicting opinions on Wayland. Some say it has been flawed and broken from the start and some say that it's actually pretty good. \n A couple of examples.. \n https://serebit.com/posts/wayland-is-pretty-good/\n https://dudemanguy.github.io/blog/posts/2022-06-10-wayland-xorg/wayland-xorg.html\n Classic example of these two conflicting opinions. At this point, I just don't know what side to trust. If Wayland is truly so bad, then us being stuck with X11 doesn't sound good for the future of Linux desktop at all, considering that it's painfully obvious X11 is not even designed for modern computing.

Even though I'm sure about this change, I can't decide wich distro use. So far the only thing I'm sure about is that I'll choose an ubuntu based one.\n On my research I narrowed down to 2 options: Pop os and Zorin os.\n The thing that bums me out about Zorin Os is the fact that Zorin Group seems to take a lot of time to release a new update to their OS. And the thing that bums me out about Pop os is that they're about to change gnome for cosmic, and I don't know what to expect from this change. Will it be worse than gnome? I don't really know.\n But after all, I realize that for coding I won't have any big difference between theese two or any other distro.

Everything is working but only when I booted back to live USB, i found out I could modify the partition easily. I think it is a huge vulnerability.\n I made some minimal changes to the installation, like installing one or two packages and updating. So it isn't hard to reinstall and set everything up again. The problem is I am afraid it will cause additional writes to SSD and therefore reducing lifespan. (I know it's negligible and the one I am using isn't from a random brand.)\n So, is it worth it to perform a reinstall with encryption? Also what encryption should I use as a balance between performance and security?\n Btw, should I encrypt the EFI partition (/boot/efi) on the external SSD? I think I need to encrypt partitions instead of entire disk because I also have other partitions.

I got very good feedback and I was working on improving the service addressing user requests and resolving reported issues. Today, I'm very excited to share that the update is now live. Some of the major improvements include:\n  \nExpanded Collection: Explore over 400 distro versions, including various End-of-Life releases \n Internet is enabled for signed-in users (most requests was for this). It's now possible download and install software packages in the VM.\n Better usability on small screen devices, allowing keyboard input and easy scrolling the VM screen.\n Login credentials and instructions are displayed for some distros to easily enter into live mode\n Improvements to minimize latency while accessing VMs.\n  \nI have also received requests to enable disks in the VMs to try out the installation process. However, it is not currently feasible due to cost concerns.\n Many thanks to everyone who donated and sent their valuable suggestions. I hope you all will find the updates useful. Check it out now at DistroSea- Test drive Linux distros online\n Note: Do not access personal data inside the VMs. Please shutdown the VM after use to immediately allocate the server resources for another user.\n I'm currently looking for sponsors.

This doesn't affect MacOS, which doesn't have Calibri installed by default, nor Calibri Light, which looks and works as expected on Office 365 also when accessed from Linux Systems.\n Can some of you friendly folk with access to Office 356 upload a screenshot of what you see when you format the words \"Calibri Regular\" with Calibri and Calibri Light on Word (at 18px) and Power Point (at 96px)?\n The curiosity is killing us :)\n Thanks !\n [1] https://jdsalaro.com/note/comparison-new-microsoft-default-font-calibri-aptos/\n [2] https://www.reddit.com/r/typography/comments/14zenfg/a_quick_look_into_microsofts_new_default_font/\n    submitted by    /u/jdsalaro  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "TL;DR Just some venting about a broken installation...\n My Arch installation just broke some hours ago. Working like a charm for quite some time now, this is the first major issue (besides those pesky Nvidia drivers) I encountered. And, to be honest, I have absolutely no idea what happened, my PC seemingly decided to not recognize the SSD as something it should boot from anymore. My first attempt at fixing this was checking the GPT / MBR and partitions with a Ubuntu live-installation using gdisk, which promptly complained that the EFI partition was not aligned properly. Wondered (still do) how that happened but proceeded to fix it with parted. I also mounted the partitions to check whether some important files were missing or corrupted, but everything was normal. With the GPT being valid, all partitions aligned and working and the boot flags set where needed I though my work was done and blissedly rebooted. Of course it didn't work. I unplugged every other drive that could somehow get in the way in the boot order (my PC is sometimes a bit whacky in regards to that), still not working. Then it occurred to me that maybe GRUB was somehow damaged and it could not load the 2nd or even 1st stage or something like that (I had used grub-install just before it broke down, but neither on the drive nor the partitions in question). Back on the Ubuntu I checked for that but it seems to be fine. As of now I currently contemplate whether it is worth to fiddle around some more or if it'd be better to just re-install and then restore my data.\n    submitted by    /u/Valcalen  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "To access the OpenVPN server on your Synology device from outside the mobile operator's network, you need to set up proper port forwarding on the router that is connected to the mobile operator's network. Here are some steps to take:\n  \nSet up an OpenVPN server on your Synology device using the DSM admin interface. Make sure all necessary settings are configured, such as IP addresses, authentication protocols, and certificates.\n \nOn the router that is connected to the mobile operator's network, you need to forward the OpenVPN ports to the IP address of your Synology device. The standard OpenVPN port is 1194 (UDP). Check your router's manual for how to set up port forwarding.\n \nFor mobile carriers, you may also need to set up network address translation (NAT) on your router to redirect traffic from the external network to your Synology device's IP address on your local network. Consult your mobile operator's documentation or support for specific NAT setup instructions.\n \nMake sure the OpenVPN server is running on your Synology device.\n \n After completing these steps, you should be able to connect to the OpenVPN server on your Synology device from outside your mobile operator's network using the public IP address or dynamic DNS assigned to your router.\n It is also worth remembering that some mobile operators may block certain ports or protocols, which may make it difficult to access from outside. In this case, contact your mobile operator for more information on restrictions and how to bypass them.\n    submitted by    /u/maciej1993  \n [link]   [comments]",

I remember starting out with Slackware many years ago and getting so FRUSTRATED because literally nothing worked. If you've never heard of Roaring Penguin's PPPoE scripts, LILO, ALSA configuration, injecting self-compiled GPU module patches, having to become a professional cyber detective without a monitor or Internet to find out your monitor timings consider yourself LUCKY. Up until maybe 2000 Linux was a disaster that would send you to an asylum if you're not of a strong mind. People wrecked their marriages, spines, eyes and whatnot. Consider this every time you boot.

I struggled with a few things such as scrolling files off screen, hovering them properly, resetting cursor position, etc. I've since learned more and implemented all my knowledge. This time around I made a push and pop implementation for bash, in bash, which made writing this file manager much easier. I wrote this to increase my productivity on the commandline; This allows me to navigates files much quicker and edit them without any trouble, no more worrying about copy/pasting names, remembering them or using wildcards to make up the difference. Instead of ls, cd, EDITOR, pwd, etc - They are handled by simply using the arrow keys or H, J, K, L respectively\n This is a compelete rewrite focused on stability, simplicity and design before continuing on to features. Majority of the fearures mentioned in the README.md are not implemented yet (adding more features is not hard). Anyway, I'm curious what everyone thinks about it; If you'd use it, what could change, etc. Any testers, contributions or feedback is really, much appreciated!\n    submitted by    /u/wick3dr0se  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "You might have heard the news that China has released a homegrown Linux distro dubbed OpenKylin. I know very well that stuff made-in-China (especially those labeled \"independently created\") can be pretty sloppy in implementation details. So consider this post \"how not to properly configure a Linux system\". Here we go:\n  \nThe ISO archive doesn't have checksums. MD5 values are available at the official website\n Some common CLI utilities (less, man) are not installed by default.\n I've received two system upgrades since fresh install. Both upgrades are tagged w/ version 602.0001 and share the same patch notes. The version number cannot be found in dpkg -l. There must be another package management mechanism running. \n ...and it's definitely not Flatpak. Although Flatpak is preinstalled, no remotes (not even flathub) are preconfigured\n \n APT is configured w/ APT::Get::AllowUnauthenticated=true, effectively bypasses package signing. \n Combining the fact that the default APT repository is accessed via plain-text HTTP, this is wide open to man-in-the-middle attacks.\n \n Docker is preinstalled and enabled. The Docker bridge network is configured as \"bip\": \"128.128.0.1/16\". You can't access this part of the Internet anymore.\n (Important) packages can be outdated. ca-certificates is at version 20190110 which is four years old.\n /etc/localtime is a symlink to /usr/share/zoneinfo/Asia/Shanghai but the content of /etc/timezone is Etc/UTC.\n Proprietary packages (e.g. nvidia-driver-510) can be installed via apt without editing the default sources.list. I guess they don't have to worry about legal issues.\n Like Ubuntu, systemd-resolved is the default DNS service. But theres' also a dnsmasq service enabled, listening to 127.0.0.1:53 with the default upstream set to 114.114.114.114 (provided by www.114dns.com) \n Though systemd-resolved is running with stock config file. No custom upstream configured.\n \n  \nFeel free to ask me for stuff that you are curious about.\n    submitted by    /u/ImaginaryMarketing  \n [link]   [comments]",

I have used Linux for years but have not played with many distros in awhile and have realized I am a bit behind on what some things support. I was wondering if anyone could recommend something that has these features. \n 1 - Wayland Support\n 2 - Rolling Updates/Releases\n 3 - KDE Support(I can normally add this myself)\n 4 - DNF or APT (ANYTHING but pacman. I hate pacman) \n I have considered Rocky Linux or Fedora. But I am not sure how good the Wayland support in either of those are right now. I am currently running this. I am wanting to setup a highly customized system that I can compile the Kernel for myself. I used Gentoo for a bit but I occasionally need to use programs for work that are on Linux but dont have all open source binaries and I am then limited to RPM/DEB packages.. Having to compile everything from source or be forced to use snap / flatpaks is a no go for me.. If I could use DEB or RPM packages I would stick with Gentoo. Also please excuse my ugly KDE ui. I just switched from Gnome to KDE and I am still customizing it. \n https://preview.redd.it/iur2c88xotbb1.png?width=3820&format=png&auto=webp&s=33f28a0662c68efc365dd93d5c35513607005176\n    submitted by    /u/NeoMetra  \n [link]   [comments]",

Fair warning though, I have very little programming experience, so at this point this is just an idea for anyone who might think this is a good idea.\n Create what is basically an upgrade assistant to move people from Windows to Linux. Make it very simple to use. It will copy over files automatically (or from a backup which can be prompted for or created in the program) to the appropriate areas in Linux. It will auto install all of the programs the user needs with the Linux equivalents (or that the user selects, should they decide they don't need all the programs they've installed in Windows).

          "description": "A year ago today, I wrote a journal entry making plans to end everything. It wasn't the first such entry, either. I was deeply addicted to gaming, sinking lower and lower, year by year. I was a complete loser, life was challenging and depressing, and I couldn't feel any joy.\n Then, in one computer science lecture, the professor was talking about Linux, and mentioned, “Linux is an important OS for computer science. But I don't think any of you should install it, because it will break your computer, unless you know what you're doing.”\n I had heard of Linux, but used to dismiss it as a niche OS. Curiosity got the better of me, and I decided to try it out anyway, my first distro being Ubuntu. I was amazed how well it ran compared to Windows. I was also learning new stuff and customizing things left and right.\n Even more amazingly, I felt joy for the first time in a long time. Real joy.\n However, I didn't know what I was doing, and broke my computer just as the professor foretold. I had to reinstall Ubuntu many times. During one of these reinstall, I accidentally wiped the entire disk, including the Windows installation I was dual-booting to play my games.\n The enjoyment I got from using and customizing Linux, combined with a laziness to install Windows, was exactly what I needed to eventually get rid of my gaming addiction. It had a hold over me for over a decade, and I was finally free. Linux also led the way to me rediscovering some of my older hobbies, as well as restoring my enjoyment of coding.\n Now, one year from that journal entry, life is still incredibly difficult and overwhelming at times, but I have regained hope. And I find joy in my activities, not the least of which is simply using my computer running Linux. Linux saved my life and turned it around. I am eternally grateful.\n    submitted by    /u/_Aetos  \n [link]   [comments]",

They will make up any excuse why the line is not going up and make terrible decisions to hopefully make the line go up.\n I've been a CentOS user for years and now a rocky linux user, but I think it's time to leave that flavor behind entirely. So with that in mind I was looking at other options, Ubuntu being one of them because of the option for enterprise support, but there it is again \"Line goes up\".\n This is why I intend to switch to Debian 12, the latest long term supported version of Debian. Debian is bona fide community run open source project with no profit margins, shareholders, executives, etc. Therefore for Debian there is no line that must go up.\n I implore you as Linux lovers and enjoyers to switch to a distribution in no way tied to a company or gets source from a company and return to the community backed projects that made Linux what it is today.\n Edit: it's surprising to me people still don't know what the issue is.

          "description": "One often stated premise as to why the GPLv2 and certain licenses deemed incompatible by the community is: dynamic linking obviously creates a derived work.\n See for instance the Software Freedom Conservancy's view:\n  \nThe FSF, stewards of the GPL, have stated many times over the past decades that they believe there is no legal distinction between dynamic and static linking of a C program and we agree.\n  \nBut is there any solid reason to believe this is the case? Any case law? Any reasoning from similar facts?\n Because my admittedly shallow view is -- I'm just not sure a copyright license has this kind of power.\n Imagine an extreme case, you build some software which links to MegaEvil Corp's libc, which license specifically states, if you dynamically link to this libc, your work is a derived work of MegaCorp libc, and you forfeit all claims of copyright of your work to MegaEvil Corp. My guess is many courts would say building any such software at an API boundary would be fair use, and copyright law simply does not grant any court the power to enforce this copyright term.\n Why might I guess this is the case? Because courts have actually taken similar positions several times re: software fair use. See, Sega Enterprises Ltd. v. Accolade, Inc., 977 F.2d 1510 (9th Cir. 1992), and Lewis Galoob Toys, Inc. v. Nintendo of America, Inc., 780 F. Supp. 1283 (N.D. Cal. 1991).\n But much worse than the SFC and FSF simply being incorrect is, I worry they either 1) don't know any better or are 2) purposefully misleading users about what the GPL says, and how copyright law works. By encouraging a cramped reading of the GPL and ignoring copyright fair use, they are actually making it harder to build software which interoperates with other software (see ZFS and Linux), and, while the FSF seemed to take Google's side in the Oracle v. Google case, their reasoning re: dynamic linking puts them squarely within Oracle's intellectual camp with respect to copyright fair use.\n    submitted by    /u/small_kimono  \n [link]   [comments]",

I ran RHEL once (because of scary sounding things like this month's news), it cost me about $400/year to get RHEL. Migrated from CentOS to RHEL thinking it would make O/S upgrades easier (wrong). It was a headache getting to RHEL and…",

Rowe）要求的必读书。\n金茨堡撰写此书有重要的历史背景：当时左翼思潮在全球兴起，欧洲史学跟随转向，批评过去主流史学太关注精英阶级，而忽略了底层民众的历史。因此，《奶酪与蛆虫》的一手材料，来自十八世纪宗教法庭对小磨坊主的审讯记录。王笛指出，在中国，很难找到类似的记录，因为中国的历史书写，向来不重视下层和一般人的数据记录和保存。\n王笛的《碌碌有为：微观历史视野下的中国社会与民众》是他主讲的通识教育音频课程的讲稿，共一百五十六课，分为三大部分：（一）人口、农村与城市；（二）日常生活、家庭和文化；（三）宗教、社会组织与法律。王笛引用法国年鉴学派代表者布罗代尔的说法，指出历史过程分为长时段（自然史）、中时段（社会史）和短时段（政治史）。《碌碌有为》就是讲中时段的历史：\n按照布罗代尔的观点，如果我们只关注政治史，就只能看到大海表面的波涛，而不能观察到政治波涛下面更重要的潜流。\n……海面上的波涛往往由下面的潜流决定，所以我们要把历史放到显微…",

          "description": "《哲学的生活方式》，[法]皮埃尔∙阿多著，姜丹丹译，上海译文出版社2023年5月出版，321页，68.00元\n\n有两个简洁有力的提法，能让我们把握西方古代哲学的精髓。一个是“希腊悲剧时代的哲学”，十九世纪七十年代由德国哲学家尼采提出。他把“前苏格拉底哲学”置于自己所称扬的“悲剧时代”，让这些哲学家的人格和学说相映生辉，闪耀着“悲剧时代”的别样光芒。“悲剧时代”的哲学家是伟大的个人，有着伟大的个性，如同特立独行的悲剧英雄。哲学家的个性决定了哲学家的生活，两者都优先于他的哲学学说，因后者不过是他的伟大个性的一种外在显现。这个提法从西方哲学的本原即“前苏格拉底哲学”重估整个古代哲学，“悲剧时代”并非一个描述性的历史时期，而是一种典范性的时代精神。此后的苏格拉底和柏拉图，以及更后来的希腊化时期哲学家，由于背离了“悲剧时代”的精神，去古日远，彻底改变了哲学的本质，使之走上了知识乐观主义的衰颓之路。\n另一个提法是一百年后由法国哲学史家皮埃尔·阿多（1922-2010）倡导的“作为生活方式的哲学”。这个提法甚至要从西方哲学的本原——古希腊哲学——出发，来重估整个西方哲学史。阿多的命题不仅是说，古代哲学的实质是追求智慧的生活方式，而且更进一步地说，由古希腊哲学导源的整个西方哲学，都没有放弃哲学的生活方式这一传统。它像一条若隐若现的线索，贯穿由古至今的西方哲学，规定其本质。从“前苏格拉底哲学家”到古代晚期的普罗提诺，这条线索彰明较著。基督教兴起以后，这条线索看似断裂，但实际上隐伏于深处。基督教重新整合了古代哲学，把柏拉图学派和亚里斯多德学派的哲学辩论保留下来为自己服务，使之与原先的生活方式分离，成为神学论辩里的材料。古代哲学便主要显现为一种辩论和理论体系，因为只有基督教才同时可以是理论辩论和生活方式，也就是唯一的“哲学”。不过，文艺复兴以来，哲学与基督教又逐渐脱离，与经院哲学以及继承其衣钵的…",

R.利维斯所创办、并在英文学科史上产生深远影响的著名杂志《细察》从一开始就是一本“跨学科学术研究的典范”，“除了发表传统文学批评之外，它也刊登有关电影、音乐、广告和其他流行文化形式的论文和评论”（31页）。即便在英美新批评最鼎盛的时代，坚持采用“跨学科”的方法来研究文学的情况也广泛存在。尤其是擅长从政治和经济角度切入文学的传统马克思主义批评，擅长运用历史和社会材料的实证主义批评，以及擅…",

          "description": "克里斯托弗·贝里（章静 绘）\n\n本文为克里斯托弗·贝里教授专访的下半部分，他介绍了亚当·斯密和苏格兰启蒙运动对现代社会的影响，以及他所做的有关“奢侈”概念的经典研究。\n从方法论的角度，苏格兰启蒙对现代社会科学有什么样的启示？您多次提到苏格兰启蒙受到关注的原因之一就是哈耶克将对自生自发的秩序（spontan eous order）和建构秩序（artificial order）的区分传统归因到苏格兰启蒙。前者关注社会与文化的历史演化，这种方法论被认为源自于苏格兰启蒙，苏格兰启蒙中对习俗而非理性的强调是否可以认为是受自然科学影响的产物？苏格兰启蒙在如何处理好规范与经验、普遍性与多样性的关系问题上，为社会科学方法论提供了什么样的启发？\n克里斯托弗·贝里：哈耶克因为所秉持的经济理论以及他对凯恩斯经济理论的反对而闻名，他所属的奥地利经济学派所持的观点在十九世纪末属于比较边缘的学术观点。奥地利学派的观点在一定程度上是斯密主义的体现，但是对斯密围绕对个人利益和公共善的追求的观点做了非常狭窄的解读。奥地利学派认为，与其他人相比，每个人是自我利益的最佳判断者，个体之间相互合作，在此基础上产生需求，产业机构试图满足这种需求，这就是价格机制的运行过程。用哈耶克的话来说，价格就是一个信号，从需求状况中传递生产信息。这是一种对奥地利经济学派的观点毫无修饰的陈述，哈耶克则多次使用了一个弗格森所运用的表达来描述这一观点，这个表达就是自生自发的秩序。自生自发的秩序是一个很古老的观念，指代的是这样一个没有任何直接的人为因素或者说官僚力量的影响，事物自有其发展方式的秩序模式，自生自发的秩序也意味着客观上也没有人可以控制这个发展的过程。很多持哈耶克观点的人对此是毫无保留的，都认为这种自生自发的秩序是最佳的，因为是由个体来决定自己的兴趣和利益是什么。我总是通过一件轶事来跟学生阐述这一理论。我曾经到美国进行过两次讲学…",

          "description": "《最厉害的家伙》书影\n\n1956年4月，香港三育图书文具公司出版了一部“滑稽讽刺小说”《最厉害的家伙》，原著者丹蒙·伦扬（版权页印作D·伦扬），译者金庸。共收录翻译小说七篇，依次是《吃饭比赛》《柠檬少爷》《记者之妻》《十二枪将》《最厉害的家伙》《超等大脚》和《恋爱大王》（以下称为前七篇）。\n一\n此七篇小说，根据目前零星资料判断，初刊是在香港《新晚报》，署名是“温华篆”，具体日期不详，大致在1950年10月至1952年6月期间，香港《新晚报》创刊于1950年10月，创刊伊始即连载金庸翻译的《中国震撼着世界》，继后是《朝鲜美军被俘记》《朝鲜血战内幕》，1952年6月5日，翻译完《朝鲜血战内幕》，推测前七篇就出现在这一时间段之内。金庸在完成职业翻译工作任务之余，翻译了这些短篇小说，在《朝鲜血战内幕》连载结束，金庸又接续前文未竟之事，接连翻译出《马场经纪》《神枪大盗》《开夹万专家》（以下称为后三篇），于6月6日开始连载，至7月2日结束，署名也是“温华篆”。但是，前七篇结集《最厉害的家伙》出版，并未包含后三篇。\n1966年11月前后，前七篇再刊于香港《明报》，署名“金庸”，由云君配图。\n1981年3月1日至4月3日，前七篇再次刊于新加坡《南洋商报》，署名“金庸”，无配图。其后，再未见到出现刊载。\n2016年7月，香港天地图书有限公司出版《香港当代作家作品选集·金庸卷》，李以建编，收录了前七篇。\n需要注意的是，此书收录的七篇作品，与《最厉害的家伙》在编目排序上有所变化，在文字上也不尽相同，被故作聪明的编辑动了手脚，在引文上敬请读者小心使用。\n实际上，金庸翻译丹蒙·伦扬小说，曾经在香港《大公报》上刊登过两篇，比《新晚报》更早。第一篇是《记者之妻》，刊登日期是1948年9月8日至12日，后来被收录到《最厉害的家伙》；第二篇是《会一会总统》，刊登日期是1948年11月23日至28日，此篇命运…",

          "description": "厌倦了窗口混乱和手动调整？ GNOME 正在集体讨论一个自动化且用户友好的窗口管理系统。这是你需要了解的情况。\n\r\n\r\n窗口管理是桌面计算的一个重要方面，几十年来一直是人们着迷和探索的话题。然而，尽管进行了多次尝试，仍然没有人能够破解完美的窗口管理解决方案的密码。GNOME 开发人员现在开始致力于彻底改变窗口管理，旨在提高生产力和用户体验。\n\r\nGNOME 开发人员 Tobias Bernard 发表了一篇 详细的文章，介绍了开发人员如何考虑为未来创新 GNOME 桌面。\n\r\n传统窗口系统的挑战\n\r\n传统的窗口系统为我们提供了很好的服务，允许应用生成可以手动移动和调整大小的矩形窗口。然而，随着窗口数量和尺寸的增加，问题开始出现。重叠的窗口很快就会变得一团糟，使得在不隐藏其他应用的情况下访问特定应序变得困难。最大化窗口可能会遮挡桌面上的其他所有内容，从而导致混乱和效率低下。\n\r\n多年来，各种操作系统引入了工作区、任务栏和切换器等解决方法来处理这些问题。然而，窗口管理的核心问题仍未解决。特别是对于儿童和老年人等计算机新手来说，手动排列窗口可能会很麻烦且乏味。\n\r\n引入平铺窗口管理器\n\r\n平铺窗口管理器提供了防止窗口重叠的替代解决方案。虽然它们在某些情况下运行良好，但也有其局限性。平铺窗口可能会导致效率低下，因为应用通常是针对特定尺寸和纵横比设计的。此外，这些窗口管理器缺乏关于窗口内容和上下文的知识，需要额外的手动调整，并违背了简化工作流程的目的。更不用说记住很多键盘快捷键了。\n\r\nGNOME 当前的平铺功能\n\r\nGNOME 已经在 GNOME 3 系列中尝试了基本的平铺功能。然而，现有的实现有一些局限性。这是一个手动过程，仅支持两个窗口，缺乏复杂布局的可扩展性，并且不会将平铺窗口分组到窗口栈中。\n\r\n窗口管理的新愿景\n\r\n该团队提出了一种新的窗口管理方法，重点关注符合用户期望和需求的自动化系统。他们的概念涉及窗口的三种潜在布局状态：马赛克、边缘平铺和浮动。\n\r\n马赛克模式将成为默认行为，根据用户偏好和可用屏幕空间智能定位窗口并调整窗口大小。随着新窗口的打开，现有窗口将进行调整以适应新来者。如果窗口不适合当前布局，它将被放置在自己的工作区中。当屏幕接近布满时，窗口将自动平铺。\n\r\n用户还可以通过将窗口拖动到现有窗口或空白区域上来手动平铺窗口。该系统提供了灵活性和便利性，使其更容易高效地执行多任务。\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n维护用户友好的浮动窗口\n\r\n虽然平铺提供了多种好处，但 GNOME 开发人员明白，总会有用户更喜欢手动定位窗口的情况。因此，经典的浮动行为仍然适用于这些特定情况，但随着新的马赛克系统的引入，它可能不太常见。\n\r\n利用窗口元数据增强性能\n\r\nGNOME 旨在优化平铺体验，以从窗口收集有关其内容的更多信息。这包括窗口的最大所需尺寸以及应用最佳运行的理想尺寸范围等详细信息。通过使用这些元数据，系统可以定制窗口布局以满足用户的需求，从而提高整体可用性。\n\r\n展望未来\n\r\n虽然 GNOME 开发人员对这个新的窗口管理方向感到兴奋，但他们也承认与这种新颖方法相关的风险。他们计划进行用户研究以验证他们的假设并完善交互。尽管没有具体的实施时间表，但该项目可能会跨越多个开发周期，并成为 GNOME 46 或更高版本的一部分。\n\r\n截至发布此内容时，还没有草案合并请求，你可以参与其中并提供反馈。\n\r\n参考自 Tobias 的博客。\n\r\n（题图：MJ/04285b09-a074-4f6f-a32e-ae5af06f1d1f）\n\r\n\r\nvia: https://debugpointnews.com/gnome-window-management-proposal/\n\r\n作者：arindam 选题：lkxed 译者：geekpi 校对：wxy\n\r\n本文由 LCTT 原创编译，Linux中国 荣誉推出",

          "description": "LUKS 是 Linux 用户中流行的磁盘加密机制。在这篇术语解析文章中，可以了解更多关于 LUKS 的信息。\n\r\n\r\n计算机安全旨在保护私密信息。有许多方法可以保护系统。一些用户使用简单的用户名/密码登录方案进行基本保护。其他用户可能会通过加密以不同的方式增加额外的保护，如使用 VPN 和磁盘加密。\n\r\n如果你的计算机上有敏感的客户数据（你可能在经营一家企业），或被视为知识产权的材料，或者你对隐私非常谨慎，你可能要考虑磁盘加密。\n\r\n磁盘加密的一些好处包括：\n\r\n\r\n保护系统免受黑客的攻击\n\r\n防止数据泄露\n\r\n保护你免受潜在的责任问题\n\r\n\r\n磁盘加密软件可以防止台式机硬盘驱动器、便携式 USB 存储设备或笔记本电脑被访问，除非用户输入正确的身份验证数据。如果你的笔记本电脑丢失或被盗，加密会保护磁盘上的数据。\n\r\n如今，新的 Windows 系统默认配备了 BitLocker 加密。在 Linux 上，LUKS 是最常用的磁盘加密方式。\n\r\n想知道什么是 LUKS？我会为你简要介绍这个主题。\n\r\n技术术语\n\r\n在继续之前，需要定义一些术语。LUKS 有很多内容，因此将其拆解为细项将有助于你进一步了解。\n\r\n卷Volume：卷是一个逻辑存储区域，可用于存储数据。在磁盘加密的场景中卷指的是已加密以保护其内容的磁盘部分。\n\r\n参数Parameters：参数是控制加密算法运行方式的设置。参数可能包括所使用的加密算法、密钥大小以及有关如何执行加密的其他详细信息。\n\r\n加密类型Cipher type**：它是指用于加密的数学算法。它指的是用于保护加密卷上数据的具体加密算法。\n\r\n密钥大小Key size：密钥大小是衡量加密算法强度的指标：密钥大小越大，加密强度越高。通常以位数表示，例如 128 位加密或 256 位加密。\n\r\n头部Header：头部是加密卷开头的特殊区域，包含有关加密的信息，例如所使用的加密算法和加密密钥。\n\r\n下一个定义对于新手来说可能有些棘手，但了解它还是很重要的，尤其在处理 LUKS 时，这会非常有用。\n\r\n容器Container：容器是一个特殊的文件，类似于虚拟加密卷。它可以用于存储加密数据，就像加密分区一样。不同之处在于容器是一个文件，可以存储在未加密的分区上，而加密分区是整个磁盘的一部分，已经完全加密。因此，容器是 充当虚拟加密卷的文件。\n\r\nLUKS 是什么以及它能做什么？\n\r\nLUKS（Linux 统一密钥设置Linux Unified Key Setup）是由 Clemens Fruhwirth 在 2004 年创建的磁盘加密规范，最初用于 Linux。它是一种知名的、安全的、高性能的磁盘加密方法，基于改进版本的 cryptsetup，使用 dm-crypt 作为磁盘加密后端。LUKS 也是网络附加存储（NAS）设备中常用的加密格式。\n\r\nLUKS 还可以用于创建和运行加密容器。加密容器具有与 LUKS 全盘加密相同的保护级别。LUKS 还提供多种加密算法、多种加密模式和多种哈希函数，有 40 多种可能的组合。\n\r\n\n\r\n任何文件系统都可以进行加密，包括交换分区。加密卷的开头有一个未加密的头部，它允许存储多达 8 个（LUKS1）或 32 个（LUKS2）加密密钥，以及诸如密码类型和密钥大小之类的加密参数。\n\r\n这个头部的存在是 LUKS 和 dm-crypt 的一个重要区别，因为头部允许使用多个不同的密钥短语，并能轻松更改和删除它们。然而，值得提醒的是，如果头部丢失或损坏，设备将无法解密。\n\r\nLUKS 有两个版本，LUKS2 具有更强的头部损坏抗击性，并默认使用 Argon2 加密算法（LUKS1 使用 PBKDF2）。在某些情况下，可以在两个版本之间进行转换，但是 LUKS1 可能不支持某些功能。\n\r\n希望了解更多信息？\n\r\n希望本文有助于你对 LUKS 和加密有一些了解。关于使用 LUKS 创建和使用加密分区的确切步骤会因个人需求而异，因此我不会在此处涵盖安装和设置方面的内容。\n\r\n如果你想要一份指南来帮助你设置 LUKS，可以在这篇文章中找到一个很好的指南：《使用 LUKS 对 Linux 分区进行基本加密指南》。如果你对此还不熟悉，并且想要尝试使用 LUKS，可以在虚拟机或闲置计算机上进行安全学习，以了解其工作原理。\n\r\n（题图：MJ/2c6b83e6-4bcb-4ce3-a49f-3cb38caad7d2）\n\r\n\r\nvia: https://itsfoss.com/luks/\n\r\n作者：Bill Dyer 选题：lkxed 译者：ChatGPT 校对：wxy\n\r\n本文由 LCTT 原创编译，Linux中国 荣誉推出",

          "description": "对于什么是 systemd，以及为什么它经常成为 Linux 世界争议的焦点，你可能仍然感到困惑。我将尝试用简单的语言来回答。\n\r\n\r\n在 Linux 世界中，很少有争议能像传统的 System V 初始化 系统（通常称为 SysVinit）和较新的 systemd 之间的斗争那样引起如此大的争议。\n\r\n在这篇文章中，我将简要讨论什么是 systemd、它相对于传统初始化系统有哪些优点和缺点以及为什么它会引起争议。\n\r\n什么是 systemd？\n\r\nsystemd 是一个系统和服务管理器，于 2010 年首次推出，用于取代传统的 System V 初始化系统。它旨在提高启动速度并更有效地管理系统服务。如今，systemd 是许多流行 Linux 发行版的默认初始化系统，包括 Ubuntu、Fedora 和 Red Hat Enterprise Linux（RHEL）。\n\r\nsystemd 是守护进程吗？\n\r\n尽管名字中带有 “d”，但 systemd 并不是一个守护进程。相反，它是一个为 Linux 提供许多系统组件的软件套件。其目标是标准化 Linux 发行版的服务配置和行为。\n\r\nsystemd 的主要组件是一个“系统和服务管理器”，它充当初始化系统来引导用户空间并管理用户进程。它还提供了各种守护程序和实用程序的替代品，从设备和登录管理到网络连接管理和事件记录。\n\r\nsystemd 的主要特性\n\r\nsystemd 具有许多功能，例如它能够主动并行化操作、方便按需启动守护进程、使用 Linux 控制组监视进程、管理挂载点和自动挂载点，以及实现复杂的基于事务依赖的服务控制逻辑。\n\r\n此外，systemd 支持 SysV 和 LSB 初始化脚本，作为 SysVinit 的替代品。它还提供了一个日志守护进程和用于管理基本系统配置的工具程序。\n\r\n\n\r\nsystemd 与 SysVinit：争议\n\r\nSysVinit 与 systemd 争论的核心围绕如何最好地管理基于 Linux 的系统。关注的范围从复杂性和兼容性到管理系统服务的最佳方式，涉及系统管理员和 Linux 爱好者面临的基本问题。\n\r\n批评者认为 systemd 过于复杂和巨大化，使得故障排除变得更加困难。他们担心单点故障，因为所有服务都由一个守护进程管理，并且担心与 Linux 内核的紧密集成，这可能会限制向其他系统的可移植性。\n\r\n这就是为什么有些人创建 脱离 systemd 的发行版 的原因。\n\r\n然而，支持者称赞 systemd 提供了一种更高效、更现代的系统管理方法，其服务启动的并行性和守护进程的按需启动减少了启动时间并提高了系统响应能力。他们还赞扬其先进的日志记录功能。\n\r\n尽管存在争议，systemd 已成为许多 Linux 发行版的默认初始化系统，系统管理员和开发人员已经开始欣赏它的高级特性和功能。\n\r\nsystemd 与 SysVinit 的优点和缺点\n\r\n优点：\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSysVinit 的优点\r\nsystemd 的优点\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n简单且熟悉\r\n提高启动速度\r\n\r\n\r\n尊重 Unix 哲学\r\n标准化日志系统\r\n\r\n\r\n更直接地控制系统服务\r\n一致的服务管理方法\r\n\r\n\r\n系统成熟稳定\r\n与现代 Linux 系统和应用程序的兼容性\r\n\r\n\r\n与遗留系统和应用的兼容性\r\n来自大型开发者和贡献者社区的积极开发和支持\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n缺点：\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSysVinit 的缺点\r\nsystemd 的缺点\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n与新的初始化系统相比功能有限\r\n复杂性和陡峭的学习曲线\r\n\r\n\r\n缺乏对服务并行启动的内置支持\r\n有侵入性，可能会破坏与传统 Unix 工具和程序的兼容性\r\n\r\n\r\n可能比新的初始化系统效率低，尤其是在大型系统上\r\n某些系统可能会出现不稳定和崩溃的情况\r\n\r\n\r\n对现代 Linux 系统和应用的有限支持\r\n与尚未支持 systemd 的遗留系统和应用的兼容性有限\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n总结：个人观点\n\r\n作为一名来自 UNIX 早期的 Linux 用户，我更倾向于传统的初始化系统。然而，尽管我最初有所抵触，但我已经开始接受 systemd，并看到了它的一些好处。每个系统在 Linux 世界中都有自己的位置，了解这两个系统非常重要。\n\r\n关于 systemd 的争论仍在继续。你对此有何看法？\n\r\n（题图：MJ/efce857c-2d1a-4bf0-a400-8eb60e9f3271）\n\r\n\r\nvia: https://itsfoss.com/systemd-init/\n\r\n作者：Bill Dyer 选题：lkxed 译者：geekpi 校对：wxy\n\r\n本文由 LCTT 原创编译，Linux中国 荣誉推出",

          "description": "很多时候，老旧的电脑往往被打上 “过时” 的标签。Linux 改变了这一现状。翻新旧电脑，让它重新为需要它的人所用。\n\r\n\r\n你可能经常听到有人说某个电脑、平板电脑或智能手机 “过时了”。当你听到这样的说法时，花一分钟问问自己：“这个人说的是个人观点还是事实？”\n\r\n很多时候他们的陈述是主观观点。让我解释一下为什么。\n\r\n当有人说一台电脑 “过时” 时，他们往往是从自己的角度出发的。因此，如果你是一名专业技术人员，一台使用了五年的电脑可能确实已经过时。但对于一个逃离战争或饥荒的难民家庭来说，这台五年前的电脑过时了吗？可能不会。对你来说过时的电脑，对别人来说可能是梦寐以求的电脑。\n\r\n我是如何用 Linux 翻新旧电脑的\n\r\n我在这方面有些经验。在过去的 25 年里，我一直把老旧电脑带给那些没有电脑的人。我的一名二年级学生，由祖母抚养长大，五年前从斯坦福大学毕业了。另一位学生，我在 2007 年给他送去了一台布满灰尘的 Windows XP 台式机，去年她从耶鲁大学毕业。这两名学生都利用捐赠的电脑实现了自我发展。后一位学生在中学毕业前，打字速度就超过了每分钟 50 个单词。我把捐赠电脑送到她家时，她还在读三年级，当时她的家庭还负担不起网络服务。因此，她有效地利用时间学习触摸打字技巧。我在这个 YouTube 视频 中记录了她的故事。\n\r\n我再分享一件连我自己都难以相信的轶事。几年前，我在 eBay 上花 20 美元买了一台戴尔笔记本电脑。这台笔记本电脑是 2002 年的顶级笔记本电脑。我在上面安装了 Linux Mint，并添加了一个 USB WiFi 适配器，这台笔记本电脑就这样重生了。我把这个故事记录在 YouTube 视频中，名为 “我的 20 美元 eBay 笔记本电脑”。\n\r\n在视频中，你可以看到这台笔记本电脑正在上网。它的速度并不快，但比我们在 20 世纪 90 年代末使用的拨号上网电脑要快得多。我会将其描述为功能正常。有人可以用这台 2002 年的笔记本电脑撰写博士论文。论文读起来就像用昨天发布的电脑写的一样好。这台笔记本电脑应该摆放在公共场所，让人们近距离看到 2002 年的电脑仍然可以使用。眼见为实。这难道不是真理吗？\n\r\n那么 2008 年、2009 年和 2010 年那些著名的 “上网本” 怎么样？它们肯定已经过时了吧？没那么快了吧！如果你在它们身上安装 32 位 Linux，它们就可以使用最新版本的 Chromium 网页浏览器上网冲浪，而 Chromium 浏览器仍然支持 32 位操作系统（不过谷歌 Chrome 浏览器不再支持 32 位操作系统）。使用这些上网本的学生可以观看可汗学院Khan Academy的视频，使用谷歌文档Google Docs提高写作能力。将这些上网本连接到更大的液晶屏幕上，学生就可以使用 LibreOffice Draw 或 Inkscape 这两个我最喜欢的开源图形程序来提高技能。如果你感兴趣，我有一个 使用 Linux 重振上网本的视频。上网本也非常适合邮寄到海外，比如利比里亚的学校、海地的医院、索马里的食品分发点，或者其他任何捐赠技术可以发挥巨大作用的地方。\n\r\n你知道翻新的上网本在哪里会受到欢迎吗？在那些向乌克兰难民敞开心扉和家园的社区。他们在尽自己的一份力量，我们也应该尽自己的一份力量。\n\r\n开源让老旧电脑重获新生\n\r\n许多技术专业人士生活在特权的泡沫中。当他们宣称某项技术 “过时” 时，可能并没有意识到他们把这种观点当作事实所造成的伤害。不了解开源如何让旧电脑重新焕发生机的人，正在宣判这些电脑的死刑。面对这种情况，我不会袖手旁观。你也不应该袖手旁观。\n\r\n对于宣称电脑过时的人，一个简单的回答是：“有时旧电脑可以重获新生。我听说开源就是一种方法。”\n\r\n如果你很了解对方，不妨分享本文列出的一些 YouTube 视频链接。如果有机会，请花点时间去见见那些无法获得所需技术的个人或家庭。这次会面将以你意想不到的方式丰富你的生活。\n\r\n（题图：MJ/cfd05206-dae4-4b14-a50c-38f2da342c95）\n\r\n\r\nvia: https://opensource.com/article/22/10/obsolete-computer-linux-opportunity\n\r\n作者：Phil Shapiro 选题：lkxed 译者：wcjjdlhws 校对：wxy\n\r\n本文由 LCTT 原创编译，Linux中国 荣誉推出",

          "description": "ChromeOS 将分离浏览器和操作系统\n\r\n现在的 ChromeOS 的系统用户界面和浏览器是同一个二进制程序，谷歌的一个已经进行了两年的项目将把它们分开，并很快将向大众推出。该项目名为 “Lacros”，这将把 ChromeOS 的 Linux 操作系统从 Chrome 浏览器中分离出来，让谷歌可以独立更新每个部分。此举的一个意图是加入更多对 Wayland 的支持。ChromeOS 此前使用的是谷歌自己开发的图形栈 Freon，而 Wayland 已经在包括安卓在内的 Linux 系统和应用中得到了广泛使用，它将作为 ChromeOS 的原生图形栈使用。分开后，谷歌也将无需为 ChromeOS 定制 Chrome，可以直接使用 Chrome 的 Linux 版本。\n\r\n\r\n消息来源：Ars Technica\n\r\n\r\n\r\n老王点评：那为什么当年要合在一起，用自己的一个图形栈？秀技术吗？\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n40% 基于 Arm 的服务器部署在中国\n\r\n虽然绝大多数服务器仍在使用 AMD 和英特尔的 x86 芯片，但这些芯片都是美国公司生产的，由于美国的贸易限制，中国公司越来越难获得先进的芯片。相比之下，Arm 架构可以获得全球芯片制造商的许可。最新数据显示，全球近 10% 的服务器采用了 Arm 处理器，其中 40% 位于中国。此外，Canalys CEO 去年指出，99% 的智能手机、97% 的平板电脑和 9% 的个人电脑都使用了 Arm 芯片，并声称 16% 的公共云已经基于 Arm。他预测，到 2026 年，50% 出售给公共云的 CPU 将基于 ARM，而不是 x86。\n\r\n\r\n消息来源：The Register\n\r\n\r\n\r\n老王点评：Arm 真是异军突起，但是我还是更看好 RISC-V。\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\nMeta 开源从文本中创建音乐的人工智能工具\n\r\nMeta 公司周三开源了名为 AudioCraft 的人工智能工具，它将帮助用户根据文本提示创建音乐和音频。该人工智能工具可用于音乐、声音、压缩和生成。Meta 说，它使用了该公司拥有的和特别授权的音乐进行了训练。不像通过文本创建图像的人工智能工具，生成音乐的工具进展相对滞后。Meta 说，“有一些工作已经完成，但非常复杂，而且不是很开放，所以人们不能轻松使用。”AudioCraft 以 MIT 许可证发布，Meta 希望“为更广泛的社区做出贡献，为音频和音乐实验提供可访问的工具。”\n\r\n\r\n消息来源：Ars Technica\n\r\n\r\n\r\n老王点评：所以，以后音乐也不需要专业人员制作了么？",

          "description": "GNOME 正在开发新的马赛克窗口管理系统\n\r\nGNOME 希望能有更强大的窗口管理系统，除了经典的浮动堆叠模式和平铺模式外，他们设计了一种新的马赛克模式作为默认模式，它结合了平铺和浮动的优点。（不是你想的那个“马赛克”😉）当你打开一个窗口，它就会以最适合应用程序的大小在屏幕中央打开。当你打开更多窗口时，现有的窗口会移到一边，为新窗口腾出空间。如果新窗口不合适，例如，因为它想最大化，它就会移动到自己的工作区。如果窗口布局接近填满屏幕，窗口就会自动平铺。但要想让每个人都满意新的窗口管理器，他们必须进行大量的用户研究，并测试无数种方案，可以想象，这可能需要数月甚至数年的时间。\n\r\n\r\n消息来源：GNOME\n\r\n\r\n\r\n老王点评：GNOME 和 KDE 不缺乏创新，并不只是抄袭 Windows 和 macOS，甚至反过来被抄袭。Linux 上的桌面环境缺乏的是精细打磨。\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n目前仍有 10,000 台大型机在使用\n\r\n大型计算机通常被视为像恐龙一样古老的机器，但是，专门用于处理海量数据的大型机在今天仍然非常重要。据估计，目前仍在使用的大型机有一万台。世界上最大的公司几乎都在使用它们，其中包括三分之二的《财富》500 强公司。而这些大型机大多来自 IBM。今天的大型机可以拥有多达 240 个服务器级 CPU、40TB 的纠错 RAM 和多 PB 的冗余闪存二级存储。\n\r\n\r\n消息来源：Ars Technica\n\r\n\r\n\r\n老王点评：一方面，云计算并没有那么可靠，另外一方面，旧的信息基础设施很难迁移，或者说，不敢迁移。\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n抗量子加密技术还需要数年\n\r\n能够破解公钥加密的量子计算机可能还需要几年时间。不幸的是，支持抗量子加密技术的产品也是如此。NIST 上周宣布的第二轮后量子算法评估预计将耗时数年，而 FIPS 产品验证流程也有后顾之忧。新标准一般需要 4 到 6 年的时间，供应商才能开发出执行该标准的专用集成电路，然后，供应商还需要时间来验证产品。由于现在窃取的加密数据可以在稍后解密，因此“现在收获，稍后解密”攻击的可能性“是一个已经存在的量子计算安全问题”。\n\r\n\r\n消息来源：E-Security Planet\n\r\n\r\n\r\n老王点评：如果不能在量子计算机真正发挥作用之前就部署好抗量子加密算法，那几乎可以肯定会面临大量的泄密事件，世界的真相也将更早揭晓。",

          "description": "FSF 指谷歌在 WEI 上的做法是“邪恶先锋”\n\r\n自由软件基金会（FSF）的 Greg Farough 批评谷歌提出的网络环境完整性（WEI）是对自由互联网的全面攻击。称该政策文件所强调的使用案例与其真正的使用案例相比，简直是小巫见大巫，因为其真正的使用案例是制定一种方法来完全彻底地限制互联网的自由。借助 WEI，政府将可以利用它来确保只有其官方 “批准”（读作：后门）的浏览器才能访问互联网；Netflix 等公司将利用它来推进数字限制管理（DRM）；谷歌将利用它来拒绝用户访问其服务，除非用户使用的浏览器符合其利润率。最初 WEI 还只是发布在 GitHub 上的一份无伤大雅的 政策文件，但谷歌现在已将其快速发展到 Chromium 浏览器中，WEI 将很快就会出现在我们面前。他说，“曾经有段时间谷歌的理念是‘不作恶’，它如此短时间内就在 WEI 上取得进展，我们可以非常肯定地说，他们现在的政策是要成为邪恶先锋。”\n\r\n\r\n消息来源：FSF\n\r\n\r\n\r\n老王点评：很多人没太理解 WEI 的危害，而这篇文章清晰的分析了其潜在的危害。但是，这种程度的社区抗议恐怕无济于事。谷歌比较忌惮的是其它企业和政府对它的反对。除了支持 Firefox 这类自由的浏览器之外，我们还可以寄希望于在其它的 Chromium 下游版本中去除 WEI。\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\nAlmaLinux 向红帽示好，被拒绝了\n\r\n红帽关闭 CentOS，推行 CentOS Stream 成为 RHEL 上游，其中一个理由是希望社区来参与 CentOS Stream/RHEL 的开发，并指责 AlmaLinux 等 RHEL 克隆品只是简单的重建，而没有做出任何贡献。而 AlamLinux 一方面表示将不再寻求 1:1 克隆，将在 RHEL 之外合并补丁，另外一方面“也尝试在 CentOS Stream 中测试和复制问题”，以示好红帽。最近，AlmaLinux 提交了一个 Iperf3 的 CVE 修复到 CentOS Stream。但红帽公司的一位高级软件工程师回复说：“感谢您的贡献。目前，我们不打算在 RHEL 中解决这个问题，不过我们会根据客户需求继续评估。”AlamLinux 不理解“只需合并即可，为什么还要拒绝修复呢？”之前曾经称 AlmaLinux 等“只是简单地重建代码”的红帽公司核心平台（又名 RHEL）副总裁 Mike McGrath 对 AlmaLinux 表示了感谢，但拒绝了这些代码。事后，McGrath 承认错失了对 AlmaLinux 表达善意的机会，并提升了该 CVE 的等级，合并了这些代码。\n\r\n\r\n消息来源：ZDNet\n\r\n\r\n\r\n老王点评：只是说说而已，谁让你真提交代码了，没事就给添乱，你知道你提交了代码，红帽要做作多少回归测试吗。\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\nPython 接受可选全局解释器锁提案\n\r\nPython 指导委员会宣布，它计划接受 PEP 703，让全局解释器锁成为可选，即 No-GIL 模式。预计将在 Python 3.13 初步支持该模式。CPython 的全局解释器锁（GIL）阻止了同时多线程执行代码，成为了在多核 CPU 上提高 Python 代码运行效率的一大障碍。Meta 公司承诺为 PEP 703 提案提供 人力支持。Python 指导委员会强调了兼容性的重要性，要避免出现类似 Python 3 的情况，称它不是 Python 4。\n\r\n\r\n消息来源：Python 基金会\n\r\n\r\n\r\n老王点评：不是 Python 4，胜似 Python 4，这一改进对将 Python 应用到重要领域很有意义。",

          "description": "在大多数编程语言中，你都会找到字符串数据类型。字符串基本上是一组字符。\n\r\n但 Bash Shell 有所不同。字符串没有单独的数据类型。这里一切都是变量。\n\r\n但这并不意味着你不能像在 C 和其他编程语言中那样处理字符串。\n\r\n在 Bash Shell 中可以查找子字符串、替换子字符串、连接字符串以及更多字符串操作。\n\r\n在 Bash 基础知识系列的这一部分中，你将学习基本的字符串操作。\n\r\n在 Bash 中获取字符串长度\n\r\n让我们从最简单的选项开始。也就是获取字符串的长度。这很简单：\n\r\n${#string}\r\n\n\r\n让我们在示例中使用它。\n\r\n\n\r\n正如你所看到的，第二个示例中有两个单词，但由于它用引号引起来，因此它被视为单个单词。连空格都算作一个字符。\n\r\n在 Bash 中连接字符串\n\r\n用技术术语来说是字符串 连接concatenation，这是 Bash 中最简单的字符串操作之一。\n\r\n你只需像这样一个接一个地使用字符串变量：\n\r\nstr3=$str1$str2\r\n\n\r\n还能比这更简单吗？我觉得不能。\n\r\n让我们看一个例子。这是我的示例脚本，名为 join.sh：\n\r\n#!/bin/bash\r\n\r\nread -p \"Enter first string: \" str1\r\nread -p \"Enter second string: \" str2\r\n\r\njoined=$str1$str2\r\n\r\necho \"The joined string is: $joined\"\r\n\n\r\n以下是该脚本的运行示例：\n\r\n\n\r\n在 Bash 中提取子字符串\n\r\n假设你有一个包含多个字符的大字符串，并且你想要提取其中的一部分。\n\r\n要提取子字符串，需要指定主字符串、子字符串的起始位置和子字符串的长度，如下所示：\n\r\n${string:$pos:$len}\r\n\n\r\n\r\n💡 和数组一样，字符串中的定位也是从 0 开始。\n\r\n\r\n这是一个例子：\n\r\n\n\r\n即使你指定的子字符串长度大于字符串长度，它也只会到达字符串末尾。\n\r\n替换 Bash 中的子字符串\n\r\n假设你有一个大字符串，并且你想用另一个字符串替换其中的一部分。\n\r\n在这种情况下，你可以使用这种语法：\n\r\n${string/substr1/substr2}\r\n\n\r\n\r\n✋ 只有第一次出现的子字符串才会以这种方式替换。如果要替换所有出现的地方，请使用 ${string//substr1/substr2}\n\r\n\r\n这是一个例子：\n\r\n\n\r\n正如你在上面看到的，“good” 一词被替换为 “best”。我将替换的字符串保存到同一字符串中以更改原始字符串。\n\r\n\r\n💡 如果未找到子字符串，则不会替换任何内容。它不会导致错误。\n\r\n\r\n在 Bash 中删除子字符串\n\r\n我们来谈谈删除子字符串。假设你要删除字符串的一部分。在这种情况下，只需将子字符串提供给主字符串，如下所示：\n\r\n${string/substring}\r\n\n\r\n\r\n✋ 通过这种方式，仅删除第一次出现的子字符串。如果要删除所有出现的内容，请使用 ${string//substr}\n\r\n\r\n如果找到子字符串，则将从字符串中删除它。\n\r\n让我们通过一个例子来看看。\n\r\n\n\r\n不用说，如果没有找到子字符串，则不会删除它。它不会导致错误。\n\r\n🏋️ 练习时间\n\r\n现在是你通过简单练习来实践字符串操作的时候了。\n\r\n练习 1：声明一个字符串 “I am all wet”。现在通过用 “set” 替换单词 “wet” 来更改此字符串。\n\r\n练习 2：创建一个字符串，以 112-123-1234 格式保存电话号码。现在，你必须删除所有 -。\n\r\n这应该会给你一些在 Bash 中使用字符串的不错的练习。在下一章中，你将学习如何在 Bash 中使用 if-else 语句。敬请关注。\n\r\n（题图：MJ/aa73b2c9-6d2f-42e2-972d-94fab56d30cc）\n\r\n\r\nvia: https://itsfoss.com/bash-strings/\n\r\n作者：Abhishek Prakash 选题：lkxed 译者：geekpi 校对：wxy\n\r\n本文由 LCTT 原创编译，Linux中国 荣誉推出",

          "description": "现存最古老的发行版 Slackware 已经 30 岁了\n\r\n本周，Slackware Linux 项目庆祝其成立 30 周年。Slackware 1.0 版本于 1993 年 7 月 16 日发布，它是目前仍在积极维护和开发的最古老的 Linux 发行版，虽然它不是第一个 Linux 发行版。最让人敬佩的是，其创始人至今仍在维护该项目。他说，“这真的是一段非凡的旅程，我在 1993 年开始时根本无法预料。”当前版本 Slackware 15 于 2021 年进入测试阶段，并于去年初发布。顺便说一句，MCC Interim Linux 可以说是第一个发行版，它的第一个候选版本 0.97 在 1991 年内核发布几个月后就出现了。Debian 比 Slackware 稍微年轻一点，是在 Slackware 发布两个月后发布的。\n\r\n\r\n消息来源：The Register\n\r\n\r\n\r\n老王点评：Slackware 是我用过的第一个 Linux 发行版，那应该是 1997 年或 1998 年。而我那时最喜欢的发行版是 Mandrake。\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n黑客之王凯文·米特尼克去世\n\r\n凯文·米特尼克Kevin Mitnick，曾被称为 “世界头号通缉黑客”，于上周日去世，享年 59 岁。他曾因侵入和篡改公司计算机网络而入狱服刑，2000 年获释后开始了新的职业生涯，担任安全顾问、作家和公共演讲人。他最为人熟知的是 20 世纪 90 年代的疯狂犯罪，当时他从美国各地的电脑中窃取了成千上万的数据文件和信用卡号码。他利用自己的技能进入美国的电话和手机网络，破坏政府、企业和大学的计算机系统。1995 年，经过长达两年多的追捕，他被美国联邦调查局抓获。\n\r\n\r\n消息来源：Engadget\n\r\n\r\n\r\n老王点评：这是一个传奇，虽然是那种以破坏为目的的“黑客”，但依然是传奇的一生。\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n苹果正在开发自己的人工智能大模型\n\r\n据报道，苹果正在开发自己的大语言模型以及类似 ChatGPT 的 AI 工具。苹果的大模型代号 “Ajax”，苹果还创建了一个聊天机器人服务，一些工程师称之为 “Apple GPT”。苹果有多个团队在 AI 项目上展开合作，它已成为苹果的一大重要工作。苹果员工表示这项工作基本上是对 Bard、ChatGPT 的复制，并不包含任何新功能或新技术。苹果正在积极改进模型，但目前没有向消费者发布的计划。\n\r\n\r\n消息来源：彭博社\n\r\n\r\n\r\n老王点评：苹果在这一点上已经大大落后，不知道什么时候它的 Siri 才可以变聪明。",

          "description": "本章将介绍如何在 Bash Shell 脚本中使用数组。学习添加元素、删除元素和获取数组长度。\n\r\n\r\n在本系列的前面部分中，你了解了变量。变量中可以有单个值。\n\r\n数组内部可以有多个值。当你必须一次处理多个变量时，这会使事情变得更容易。你不必将各个值存储在新变量中。\n\r\n因此，不要像这样声明五个变量：\n\r\ndistro1=Ubuntu\r\ndistro2=Fedora\r\ndistro3=SUSE\r\ndistro4=Arch Linux\r\ndistro5=Nix\r\n\n\r\n你可以在单个数组中初始化它们所有：\n\r\ndistros=(Ubuntu Fedora SUSE \"Arch Linux\" Nix)\r\n\n\r\n与其他一些编程语言不同，你不使用逗号作为数组元素分隔符。\n\r\n那挺好的。让我们看看如何访问数组元素。\n\r\n在 Bash 中访问数组元素\n\r\n使用索引（数组中的位置）访问数组元素。要访问索引 N 处的数组元素，请使用：\n\r\n${array_name[N]}\r\n\n\r\n\r\n💡 与大多数其他编程语言一样，Bash Shell 中的数组从索引 0 开始。这意味着第一个元素的索引为 0，第二个元素的索引为 1，第 n 个元素的索引为 n-1。\n\r\n\r\n因此，如果你想打印 SUSE，你将使用：\n\r\necho ${distros[2]}\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n🚧 ${ 之后或 } 之前不能有任何空格。你不能像 ${ array[n] } 那样使用它。\n\r\n\r\n一次访问所有数组元素\n\r\n假设你要打印数组的所有元素。\n\r\n你可以一一使用 echo ${array[n]} 但这确实没有必要。有一个更好更简单的方法：\n\r\n${array[*]}\r\n\n\r\n这将为你提供所有数组元素。\n\r\n\n\r\n在 Bash 中获取数组长度\n\r\n如何知道数组中有多少个元素？ 有一个专门的方法 在 Bash 中获取数组长度：\n\r\n${#array_name[@]}\r\n\n\r\n就这么简单，对吧？\n\r\n\n\r\n在 Bash 中添加数组元素\n\r\n如果必须向数组添加其他元素，请使用 += 运算符 将元素追加到 Bash 中的现有数组：\n\r\narray_name+=(\"new_value\")\r\n\n\r\n这是一个例子：\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n🚧 追加元素时使用 () 很重要。\n\r\n\r\n你还可以使用索引将元素设置在任何位置。\n\r\narray_name[N]=new_value\r\n\n\r\n但请记住使用正确的索引编号。 如果在现有索引上使用它，新值将替换该元素。\n\r\n如果你使用“越界”索引，它仍会添加到最后一个元素之后。例如，如果数组长度为 6，并且你尝试在索引 9 处设置新值，则该值仍将作为最后一个元素添加到第 7 个位置（索引 6）。\n\r\n\n\r\n删除数组元素\n\r\n你可以使用 Shell 内置的 unset 通过提供索引号来删除数组元素：\n\r\nunset array_name[N]\r\n\n\r\n这是一个示例，我删除了数组的第四个元素。\n\r\n\n\r\n你还可以通过 unset 来删除整个数组：\n\r\nunset array_name\r\n\n\r\n\r\n💡 Bash 中没有严格的数据类型规则。你可以创建一个同时包含整数和字符串的数组。\n\r\n\r\n🏋️ 练习时间\n\r\n让我们练习一下你所学到的有关 Bash 数组的知识。\n\r\n练习 1：创建一个 Bash 脚本，其中包含五个最佳 Linux 发行版的数组。全部打印出来。\n\r\n现在，用 “Hannah Montanna Linux” 替换中间的选择。\n\r\n练习 2：创建一个 Bash 脚本，该脚本接受用户提供的三个数字，然后以相反的顺序打印它们。\n\r\n预期输出：\n\r\nEnter three numbers and press enter\r\n12 23 44\r\nNumbers in reverse order are: 44 23 12\r\n\n\r\n我希望你喜欢通过本系列学习 Bash Shell 脚本。在下一章中，你将学习如何使用 if-else。敬请关注。\n\r\n（题图：MJ/09477e2f-2bf9-4fdf-bc1e-c894a068adf2）\n\r\n\r\nvia: https://itsfoss.com/bash-arrays/\n\r\n作者：Abhishek Prakash 选题：lkxed 译者：geekpi 校对：wxy\n\r\n本文由 LCTT 原创编译，Linux中国 荣誉推出",

          "description": "Meta 发布新大语言模型，可免费商用，采用特别的“开源”方式\n\r\nMeta 周二发布了 Llama 2：这是一套经过预训练和微调的基于文本的人工智能模型，有三种不同的规模，分别包含 70 亿、130 亿和 700 亿个参数。与之前的 LLaMA 模型不同的是，任何人都可以申请下载 Llama 2，开发人员可以用它来构建商业产品或服务，以及开展有趣的项目。Meta 表示，不会对访问或使用其开发的模型收费，而是通过向其他公司开放该技术，如与微软和亚马逊合作，在 Azure 和 AWS 上提供该模型。值得注意的是，Llama 2 采用了专门的 许可证，有一些独特的限制，因此不符合“开源”的定义。除了常见的免责声明外，开发人员不能利用其输出结果来改进其他类型的大型语言模型。以及，如果将 Llama 2 用于支持那些拥有超过 7 亿月活跃用户的应用程序的大公司，必须申请使用 Meta 技术的特殊许可。\n\r\n\r\n消息来源：The Register\n\r\n\r\n\r\n老王点评：虽然不是规范定义的“开源”软件，但至少是开放的。值得注意但是，从 LLaMA 到 Llama 2，Meta 都采用了非同寻常的“开源”方式，这或许是 Meta 既想利用开源的优势，又有一些不确定的担忧。也许人工智能领域需要一种独特的开放许可证。\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n美国启动物联网安全标签计划\n\r\n该计划的正式名称为《美国网络信任标识》，旨在帮助美国人确保他们购买的互联网连接设备具有强大的网络安全保护措施，可防范网络攻击。长期以来，物联网一直被认为是网络安全的薄弱环节。符合该标准的设备将要求具有唯一且强大的默认密码、保护存储和传输的数据、提供定期的安全更新以及具备事故检测能力等。\n\r\n\r\n消息来源：Tech Crunch\n\r\n\r\n\r\n老王点评：越来越多的物联网设备，其实是埋在信息社会底层的空洞，你不知道它什么时候就会导致塌陷。\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n印度大部分外包程序员将在两年内因人工智能而消失\n\r\nStability AI 公司的 CEO 表示，印度的大多数外包程序员将在未来一两年内失业。不过他认为，在法国等受《劳动法》保护较强的国家受到这种影响的可能性较小。他重申了他之前的说法，五年后将 “不再有程序员”，不过，他也说明，他指的是传统意义上的程序员。他说，“当你把编程这件事从错误测试、单元测试到构思进行解构时，人工智能可以做到这一点，而且做得更好。但这不是自动完成的，而是人工智能‘辅助驾驶’完成的。”\n\r\n\r\n消息来源：CNBC\n\r\n\r\n\r\n老王点评：其实也不用特别慌，就像计算器、计算机出现，并没有让原来的财务和文员失业一样，只是如果你掌握不了新工具，那这种“古典程序员”被淘汰也是自然的。",

          "description": "当你开始在桌面上使用 Linux 时，你可能会选择像 Ubuntu 或者 Linux Mint 这样的 对初学者友好的发行版。\n\r\n随着你逐渐熟悉 Linux 并且开始喜欢上它，你会加入各种社交渠道上的 Linux 相关社区，关注分享 Linux 内容的网站。而当你这样做的时候，你也会发现一些新的、相对不知名的发行版。\n\r\n因为你对这个领域还比较陌生，你可能会被诱惑尝试一个接一个的发行版，从而陷入“发行版快闪”的陷阱。\n\r\n\n\r\n于是你开始问自己这个问题：“我应该使用一个未知的发行版，还是像大多数人那样使用流行的发行版呢”？\n\r\n简单的答案是坚持使用主流的发行版，但真正的答案需要你自己思考。\n\r\n使用新的、较为冷门的发行版存在的问题\n\r\n使用“全新的、个人开发者的发行版”存在一个主要问题，那就是不确定性。你无法确定这个项目将会存在多久。可能是一年，也可能是一个月。\n\r\n我曾经见过几个发行版出现这种情况。比如，SemiCode OS 由于为程序员而创建而变得流行。类似的发行版 Emperor OS 最近消失了。这只是被停止开发的发行版长列表中的几个例子。\n\r\n你可能会说，一个有一定用户基础的旧发行版也可能出现同样的情况。这是对的，但通常情况下，有一个社区和多个开发者参与项目。这样你就有一定的保证。\n\r\n由于开发者的经验不足，新的发行版可能会缺失关键功能。例如，在撰写本文时，看起来令人惊艳的 Garuda Linux 官方并不推荐双启动。\n\r\n\n\r\n尽管 Garuda Linux 拥有相当数量的支持者和几名开发者参与项目，但仍存在这个问题。\n\r\n大多数新的发行版没有提供实质性的内容\n\r\n你经常会遇到一些全新的发行版，它们基于一些其他流行的发行版，比如 Ubuntu 或 Arch Linux。唯一的不同可能只在于默认的应用程序、主题和壁纸。\n\r\n如果它是一个“面向程序员的发行版”，它可能会默认安装一些编程应用程序。如果它是一个“游戏发行版”，它可能会默认安装一些工具，如 Steam、Wine 和 Lutris。你不太可能在图形或硬件方面看到真正的优化。\n\r\n这就是为什么很多人说，已经有了数百个发行版的拥挤空间中，我们不需要更多的发行版。毕竟，在主流发行版中安装所需的应用程序并不难。\n\r\n我反对这些新的发行版吗？\n\r\n绝对不是。\n\r\n你可能会觉得几乎没有提供任何价值的新发行版是多余的。你可能是对的，因为这些项目可能对你来说无关紧要，但对于开发它的人来说，它们是重要的。\n\r\n你有没有试过学习一门编程语言？第一个教程通常是一个“Hello World”的程序。即便是高级程序员也是从“Hello World”开始的。\n\r\n婴儿不会直接开始跑步。到达那个阶段需要时间。\n\r\n我对这些项目的看法也是一样的。如果有人热爱 Linux 并且对创建自己的“操作系统”感到兴奋，就让他们去做吧。如果你不想鼓励他们，也不要泼冷水。\n\r\n大多数项目都是从相同的方式开始的。Linux Mint 是一款非常受欢迎的 Linux 发行版。它于 2006 年开始，并以 Kubuntu 为基础。\n\r\n真的需要“一个基于 Ubuntu 的类似发行版”吗？实际上并不需要。但看看 Linux Mint 如今的地位。\n\r\n那么，你应该使用新的发行版还是不应该使用呢？\n\r\n总体而言，这取决于你自己。\n\r\n如果你不喜欢频繁格式化你的系统，并且希望继续正常生活，那就坚持使用主流的发行版。\n\r\n如果你喜欢实验，不介意频繁更换操作系统并且愿意冒着搞乱系统的风险，那么你可以尝试新的发行版。就个人而言，我建议你在虚拟机中尝试它们。如果你能有一台空闲的系统专门用于实验，那就更好了。\n\r\n你也可以使用那些在社区中存在多年，但不如 Ubuntu、Mint、Fedora 和 Debian 等发行版流行的发行版。像 PCLinuxOS、Puppy Linux、Peppermint OS 等项目拥有一个较小但活跃的社区。它们绝对是一个可靠的选择，即使用于你的主系统也没有问题。\n\r\n在选择发行版时，除了基础发行版外，你还应该看看该发行版是否经常更新，并拥有一个活跃的社区。你只需要查看该项目的论坛，看看社区中是否有足够的活动即可。\n\r\n你更喜欢哪种类型的发行版？\n\r\n这是我在选择新的较为冷门发行版和流行的主流发行版之间提出的想法和建议。\n\r\n那你呢？你更喜欢哪种类型的发行版？\n\r\n（题图：MJ/930988c0-443d-4d61-a603-1466a5e33d85）\n\r\n\r\nvia: https://news.itsfoss.com/obscure-or-maintsream-distro/\n\r\n作者：Abhishek 选题：lujun9972 译者：ChatGPT 校对：wxy\n\r\n本文由 LCTT 原创编译，Linux中国 荣誉推出",

          "description": "熟悉 ABI 的概念、ABI 稳定性的重要性以及 Linux 稳定 ABI 中包含的内容。\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLCTT 译注：昨天，AlmaLinux 称将 放弃 对 RHEL 的 1:1 兼容性，但将保持对 RHEL 的 ABI 兼容，以便在 RHEL 上运行的软件可以无缝地运行在 AlmaLinux 上。可能有的同学对 ABI 的概念还不是很清楚，因此翻译此文供大家了解。\n\r\n\r\n许多 Linux 爱好者都熟悉 Linus Torvalds 的 著名告诫：“我们不破坏用户空间”，但可能并非每个听到这句话的人都清楚其含义。\n\r\n这个“第一规则”提醒开发人员关于应用程序的二进制接口（ABI）的稳定性，该接口用于应用程序与内核之间的通信和配置。接下来的内容旨在使读者熟悉 ABI 的概念，阐述为什么 ABI 的稳定性很重要，并讨论 Linux 稳定 ABI 中包含了哪些内容。Linux 的持续增长和演进需要对 ABI 进行变更，其中一些变更引起了争议。\n\r\n什么是 ABI？\n\r\nABI 表示 应用程序二进制接口Applications Binary Interface。理解 ABI 概念的一种方式是考虑它与其他概念的区别。对于许多开发人员来说，应用程序编程接口Applications Programming Interface（API）更为熟悉。通常，库的头文件和文档被认为是其 API，以及还有像 HTML5 这样的标准文档。调用库或交换字符串格式数据的程序必须遵守 API 中所描述的约定，否则可能得到意外的结果。\n\r\nABI 类似于 API，因为它们规定了命令的解释和二进制数据的交换方式。对于 C 程序，ABI 通常包括函数的返回类型和参数列表、结构体的布局，以及枚举类型的含义、顺序和范围。截至 2022 年，Linux 内核仍然几乎完全是 C 程序，因此必须遵守这些规范。\n\r\n“…",

          "description": "Solus 4.4 有了一些令人印象深刻的升级，不久以后将推出一款新版本。\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\nSolus 是一个许久没有出现在新闻中的名字，我们上一次听说它是今年 4 月份它经历了 又一次动荡。\n\r\n幸运的是，新的组织重组似乎奏效了，因为现在我们在近两年后迎来了新发布！\n\r\nSolus 是最棒的 独立 Linux 发行版 之一，提供了非常适合初学者的用户体验。\n\r\n和它的上一个版本 Solus 4.3 相比，它带来了许多改进，这个新版本的目标是超越之前的版本。\n\r\n让我们看看 Solus 最新版本有什么新特性。\n\r\n🆕 Solus 4.4: 有什么新内容？\n\r\n\n\r\nSolus 4.4 带来了许多改进，其中一些最显著的包括以下内容：\n\r\n\r\n更好的硬件支持\n\r\n桌面环境升级\n\r\n更新的应用程序套件\n\r\n\r\n更好的硬件支持\n\r\n前所未有的，Solus 4.4 使用 Linux 内核 6.3.8 作为强大的基础来支持各种硬件。硬件支持包括：\n\r\n\r\n安全启动\n\r\n英特尔 Arc 显卡\n\r\n英伟达 40 系列显卡\n\r\nAMD Radeon RX 7600、7900 XT 和 7900 XTX 显卡\n\r\n增强对各种光传感器和加速度计的支持\n\r\n以及更多\n\r\n\r\n桌面环境升级\n\r\n这是你将找到 Solus 中最关键的错误修复和提升用户体验的改进之处。由于提供了四个不同的版本，我们将介绍每个版本中的新功能。\n\r\nGNOME 43.5\n\r\n\n\r\nSolus 4.4 采用了最新的 GNOME 43.5 版本，带来了许多调整。默认的窗口主题切换到了 Adwaita，且默认启用了深色模式。\n\r\n此外，更新了系统用户界面的样式，重新设计了系统状态菜单，方便快速更改常用设置。\n\r\nMATE 将被 XFCE 取代\n\r\n\n\r\n而对于 MATE 版本，Solus 4.4 采用了最新的 MATE 1.27.1 版本。它包括各种可靠性和可访问性的修复，更改了键盘驱动程序，以及将 qxl 视频驱动程序设为处理虚拟化视频驱动程序支持的默认驱动程序。\n\r\n遗憾的是，Solus 开发团队决定在未来的版本中 淘汰 MATE 版本，并采用 XFCE 版本。这其中的关键原因是 MATE 项目处于非常 衰败的状态，并且 没有计划支持 Wayland。\n\r\nBudgie 10.7.2\n\r\n\n\r\n对于 Budgie 版本，Solus 4.4 采用了 Budgie 10.7.2 版本，使 Solus 能够利用新的应用索引器、重新设计的设置菜单、可访问性改进等功能。\n\r\n此外，Solus 现在默认使用 Nemo 文件管理器，不再使用 Nautilus。原因是 Nautilus 被更改为 GTK4 和 libadwaita，不再符合系统其他部分的外观和感觉。\n\r\nKDE Plasma\n\r\n\n\r\n同样，在 Plasma 版本中，Solus 4.4 采用了最新的 Plasma 5.27.5 版本，以及 KDE Frameworks 5.106.0、KDE Gear 23.04.2 和 KDE 分支的 QT 5.15.9。\n\r\n这带来了许多新功能；其中一些亮点包括：\n\r\n\r\n默认应用启动器被 Kickoff 替换\n\r\nWayland 会话默认提供\n\r\nKSysGuard 被 System Monitor 替换\n\r\n新的“总览视图”，可用于管理所有活动的桌面/应用程序\n\r\n支持大屏幕模式\n\r\n\r\n更新的应用套件\n\r\n除了上述更改之外，Solus 4.4 还包括更新的应用套件，其中包括：\n\r\n\r\nFirefox 114.0.1\n\r\nLibreOffice 7.5.3.2\n\r\nThunderbird 102.12.0\n\r\nBudgie、GNOME 和 MATE 版本的默认音乐播放器为 Rhythmbox\n\r\nBudgie 和 GNOME 上的视频播放使用 Celluloid\n\r\nMATE 上的视频播放使用 VLC Player\n\r\nPlasma 上的音频播放使用 Elisa，视频播放使用 Haruna\n\r\n\r\n你可以查看 发布公告 以深入了解这个重大版本更新。\n\r\n📥 下载 Solus 4.4\n\r\nSolus 的此版本有 四个不同的版本，你可以从 官方网站 获取它们。\n\r\n\r\nSolus 4.4\n\r\n\r\n\r\nvia: https://news.itsfoss.com/solus-4-4-released/\n\r\n作者：Sourav Rudra 选题：lkxed 译者：ChatGPT 校对：wxy\n\r\n本文由 LCTT 原创编译，Linux中国 荣誉推出",

          "description": "据分析师和品牌机构估计，马斯克下令将推特的产品名称改为“X”，并将推特的图标从“小蓝鸟”更换成“X”之举，以及与此相关的各种后继行动，将使推特的品牌无形资产价值蒙受40亿至200亿美元的损失。\n\r\n\r\n美国媒体指出，从推特到X，埃隆·马斯克（Elon Musk）正在抹掉一个标志性互联网品牌。\n\r\n\r\nSiegel & Gale的品牌传播总监Steve Susi表示：“推特花了15年多的时间才在全球范围内取得这样的成就，因此失去推特这个品牌对财务来说是一个重大打击。”\n\r\n\r\n营销和品牌咨询集团Metaforce的联合创始人艾伦.亚当森表示：“从商业和品牌的角度来看，这是完全不合理的，”他称这是马斯克的“自我决定”，“对我来说，这将是历史上最快的一次企业和品牌解体。”\n\r\n\r\nInsider Intelligence的分析师Jasmine Enberg表示，“推特的企业品牌已经与马斯克的个人品牌紧密交织在一起，不管有没有X这个名字，推特的大部分既定品牌资产已经在用户和广告商中失去了。”\n\r\n\r\n市场研究公司Forrester副总裁兼研究总监迈克·普罗克斯（Mike Proulx）认为，当品牌变成动词时，它就是“圣杯”，这意味着它已经成为流行文化的一部分。“从各个方面来说，这款应用本身已经成为一种文化现象，”他表示，“马斯克一下子基本上抹去了推特15年的品牌价值，现在基本上是从零开始。”\n\r\n\r\n推特的品牌价值不菲。美国范德比尔特大学预计，推特的品牌价值介于150亿美元至200亿美元之间，和阅后即焚应用Snapchat相当。不过，品牌价值咨询公司Brand Finance对推特的品牌估值较低，约为40亿美元。Forrester分析师迪潘安·查特吉（Dipanjan Chatterjee）解释称，品牌估值很难确定，没有单一方法，这就是为什么品牌机构的估值会有所不同的原因。\n\r\n\r\n不过，多个分析师和品牌机构一致认为，自从马斯克收购推特以来，推特的品牌已经受到了重大打击。例如，据Brand Finance估计，自去年年底以来，推特的品牌价值损失了32%。随着人们对推特品牌认知的改变，广告商纷纷逃离。广告商担心，马斯克常常引发争议，并接受违反内容规则的推特用户。马斯克也表示，自去年10月以来，推特的广告收入下降了50%以上。\n\r\n\r\n近年来，也有其他科技公司进行了更名。例如，为了让公司内部的不同业务在不受搜索业务束缚的情况下实现增长，谷歌重组为Alphabet。为了强调公司对元宇宙的承诺，脸书更名为Meta。但是，他们的产品名称都保留了下来，谷歌还是搜索，脸书还是社交网络。\n\r\n\r\n来源：综合新浪财经、同花顺、凤凰网",

          "description": "7月23日凌晨，马斯克在推特上发文称，推特即将更名为X，网址也迁移到X.com。对于更名的原因，马斯克表示仅仅因为他个人喜欢字母“X”。\n\r\n\r\n随后，推特新任CEO Linda Yaccarino也发文称：X是无限交互的未来形态——以音频、视频、消息、支付/银行为中心，创建一个充满创意、商品、服务和机会的全球市场。在人工智能支持下，X将会连接所有人。在这方面，我们才刚刚处于想象的起点。\n\r\n\r\n推特公司现任CEO马斯克表示，他将用“X”取代推特著名的“蓝鸟”标志。\n\r\n\r\n据美媒透露，马斯克当晚向推特员工发送了一封电子邮件，告诉他们公司将变成X公司，这是他最后一次使用推特后缀发送邮件。\n\r\n\r\n马斯克此前承认，推特的广告收入只有过去的近一半，受此影响，该公司的现金流一直为负数，且债务负担沉重。马斯克称，他将采取更多措施，通过品牌重塑将这家社交媒体公司带向新的方向。更换品牌标志就是其中之一。\n\r\n\r\n推特新任首席执行官雅卡里诺（Linda Yaccarino）随后附和称，能拥有再一次给别人留下深刻印象的机会非常难得，“X将更进一步，改变全球市中心广场”。\n\r\n\r\n为什么是X\n\r\n\r\n在宣布更名后，马斯特说：“不太确定是什么微妙的原因给了我这样的感觉，但我就是喜欢字母X。”他还放出一张自己交叉双臂摆出“X”姿势的照片。\n\r\n\r\n雅卡里诺对X作出更多解释。她称，X将是“未来无限互动的状态，以音频、视频、信息、支付/银行为中心，为思想、商品、服务和机会创造一个全球市场”。\n\r\n\r\n营销咨询公司Metaforce联合创始人亚当森（Allen Adamson）认为，鉴于马斯克使用“X”这个名字的渊源很长，这一改变并不令人惊讶。\n\r\n\r\n事实上，马斯克的每一个产品几乎都包含“X”元素。\n\r\n\r\n1999年，马斯克创办了一家名为X.com的金融服务初创公司，后成为广为人知的在线支付平台PayPal。他在2002年建立的美国太空运输公司SpaceX中也有“X”。特斯拉推出的SUV车型也被命名为“Model X”。\n\r\n\r\n去年10月收购推特时，马斯克也曾写道：“收购推特是创建X的加速器，X是一个超级应用（the everything app）。 ”\n\r\n\r\n今年3月，马斯克又创建了X公司（X Corp），该公司拥有推特社交网络服务。马斯克已宣布将推特作为其他产品的基础。有英媒评论称，这反映了马斯克希望打造一个像中国的微信一样的“超级应用”的愿景。\n\r\n\r\n不过，亚当森认为，由于马斯克做出的一系列其他重大改变，推特的一大部分受众开始对这个社交平台产生了反感，这一改变会让他们感到非常困惑。\n\r\n\r\n独立研究咨询公司Forrester研究总监普劳克斯（Mike Proulx）也表示，此举将进一步疏远推特的原有忠实用户群。“你可以说他将摆脱一个标志性品牌。但他也在表明，公司将朝着不同的方向发展，拥有不同的用户群。”他说。\n\r\n\r\n收购后马斯克都干了什么\n\r\n\r\n这不是马斯克第一次对推特进行“大刀阔斧”的变革。\n\r\n\r\n在马斯克以440亿美元获得推特的控制权后，他迅速解雇了推特的高管领导层，并解散了董事会。随后，该公司进行了四轮大规模裁员，将员工人数从约7800人减少到约1500人，减幅约为80%。\n\r\n\r\n在马斯克接管推特平台后的最初几个月里，许多广告商因担心混乱而纷纷撤资，导致推特广告收入大幅减少。\n\r\n\r\n今年早些时候，马斯克开始将推特的部分运营重点转向订阅业务，推出每月8美元订阅服务Twitter Blue，为付费用户提供编辑功能等额外服务。该公司最近还开始与某些创作者分享广告收入，但要求其必须为Twitter Blue用户。\n\r\n\r\n本月初，作为Twitter Blue服务的一部分，马斯克宣布推特将限制普通账户每天阅读推文的数量，这迅速引发用户和营销专家的尖锐批评，认为这可能会赶走更多的广告商，并削弱推特的文化影响力。\n\r\n\r\n事实似乎也是如此。脸书母公司Meta Platforms在7月5日推出了推特的竞品Threads，并在首发5天内实现注册人数突破1亿。\n\r\n\r\n今年3月，马斯克告诉员工，推特的估值已跌至他收购该公司时的一半以下，但他仍然保持乐观，他说，他相信有一天推特的价值会超过2500亿美元。\n\r\n\r\n稿源：第一财经",

          "description": "在多名欧盟用户抱怨无法通过VPN访问Instagram的Threads应用后，Meta回应称正在阻止此类行为。该公司上周推出了Threads，但考虑到该应用的隐私问题，欧盟国家无法使用该应用。该公司在一份声明中称，已采取进一步措施阻止用户访问这款新的社交应用。\n\r\n\r\n\"Threads目前在大多数欧洲国家无法使用，我们已采取进一步措施阻止这些国家的用户访问Threads。欧洲仍然是Meta一个非常重要的市场，我们希望未来能够将Threads推向更多国家，\"Meta在向社交媒体顾问Matt Navarra提供的一份声明中表示。\n\r\n\r\n今天早些时候，一些欧盟用户开始在Twitter上发布截图，表示即使使用VPN也无法访问Threads应用。\n\r\n\r\n根据Meta的隐私政策和应用程序的iOS列表，Threads应用程序广泛跟踪用户，其中披露了该应用程序可能会收集一系列个人数据，包括高度敏感的信息，如健康和财务数据、精确位置、浏览历史、联系人和搜索历史。\n\r\n\r\n这种做法给Meta在欧盟的法律和监管带来了挑战。\n\r\n\r\n根据欧盟数据保护法，Meta需要有有效的法律依据才能合法地处理这些个人数据，用于广告定向--在最近的一项法院裁决之后，该公司在这一领域正面临着越来越多的不确定性。\n\r\n\r\n这还不是全部： 该集团新出台的反垄断制度--《数字市场法》（Digital Markets Act）也限制了守门巨头如何将数据用于广告投放。据报道，Meta公司将DMA如何适用于其数据使用的不确定性作为推迟在欧盟推出Threads的原因。\n\r\n\r\n尽管尚未在欧洲大部分地区正式推出，但Meta的Twitter竞争对手已经有了一个良好的开端，该应用在短短几天内注册人数就突破了1亿。\n\r\n\r\n然而，根据分析监测公司Sensor Tower的数据，与上周六相比，本周的日活跃用户数量下降了20%，在该应用上花费的时间也有所减少。因此，随着Meta版Twitter的新鲜感逐渐消失，Threads的热度是否会逐渐消退还有待观察。\n\r\n\r\n本周早些时候，Meta更新了Thread iOS应用，支持iOS 17，缩小了可执行文件的大小，并进行了其他小的改进。\n\r\n\r\n工程师卡梅隆-罗斯（Cameron Roth）在回应一篇有关缺乏移植到Web或桌面版支持的帖子时说，开发工作不像是用户移动手指\"打开它\"那么简单。\n\r\n\r\n稿源：cnbeta",

This\n\tvulnerability, identified as CVE-2022-40982, enables a user to\n\taccess and steal data from other users who share the same\n\tcomputer. For instance, a malicious app obtained from an app store\n\tcould use the Downfall attack to steal sensitive information like\n\tpasswords, encryption keys, and private data such as banking\n\tdetails, personal emails, and messages. Similarly, in cloud\n\tcomputing environments, a malicious customer could exploit the\n\tDownfall vulnerability to steal data and credentials from other\n\tcustomers who share the same cloud computer.\n\n\nA series of patches has landed in the mainline kernel, including one for gather data sampling\nmitigation and one to disable the AVX\nextension on CPUs where microcode mitigation is not available.\n\"This is a *big* hammer.  It is known to break buggy userspace that\nuses incomplete, buggy AVX enumeration.\"\n\nNot to be left out, AMD processors suffer from a return-stack overflow\nvulnerability, again exploitable via speculative execution; this patch, also just\nmerged, describes the problem and its mitigation.",

          "description": "The Python global interpreter lock (GIL) has long been a barrier to\nincreasing the performance of programs by using multiple threads—the GIL\nserializes access to the interpreter's virtual machine such that only one thread\ncan be executing Python code at any given time.  There are other mechanisms\nto provide \nconcurrency for the language, but the specter of the GIL—and its reality as\nwell—have often been cited as a major negative for Python.  Back in October\n2021, Sam Gross introduced\na proof-of-concept, no-GIL version of the\nlanguage. It was met with a lot of excitement at the time, but\nseemed to languish to a certain extent for more than a year; now, the Python\nSteering \nCouncil has announced its intent to accept the\nno-GIL feature.  It will still be some time before it lands in a\nreleased Python version—and there is the possibility that it all has to be\nrolled back at some point—but there are several companies backing the\neffort, which gives it all a good chance to succeed.",

Cyber security, the societal impact of AI, data and privacy are important issues for legislators globally. At the same time, the COVID-19 pandemic drove collaborative development to unprecedented levels and took Open Source software, open research, open content and data from mainstream to main stage. Moving forward, developing these important public policies whilst not harming the ecosystem requires an understanding of how the Open Source ecosystem works. Ensuring stakeholders without historic benefit of representation are included in those discussions becomes paramount to that end.\n\nThe OPA will focus on educating public policy makers on Open Source to inform their development and deliberation of new policy concepts. There are unintended consequences that come from a lack of understanding of how open collaboration works in practice. The OPA will address this as well as the historic absence of contribution from underrepresented groups. The interest areas of the OPA community will complement those of Digitable Public Goods Alliance, a UNICEF multi-stakeholder initiative with a mission to accelerate the attainment of sustainable development goals in low- and middle-income countries that OSI joined earlier this year.",
