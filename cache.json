          "description": "Hi all, we recently open sourced the first version of Hashquery, a Python library which lets you model analytics, DRY up common logic, and execute it against a database or warehouse.\nWe were originally rendering SQL directly for all our queries, but that spiraled out of control with more complex analysis; the SQL needed to be changed sporadically for each new database dialect (BigQuery, Redshift, Aethena, Postgres, etc etc) and the SQL fragments were very challenging to reuse (and so fragments were copy-pasted all over).\n~~~\nAdvantages we think it has over writing SQL by hand:\n- Queries are fully compossible, so any analysis can be chained into further analysis without refactoring.\n- All analysis executes within the data warehouse itself, making them super fast for big data.\n- It's just Python, so you can extend or parameterize query logic with a simple def function.\n- You can run it anywhere, like inside of unit tests, ETL nodes, or Jupyter notebooks.\n- Developer experience is pretty good since editors already know how to autocomplete Python. ChatGPT knows Python already too :)\n- The library handles normalizing between database dialects. Write once and use in any database.\n- Hashquery content is fully serializable, which makes it a good fit for exposing a flexible API for consumers to efficiently query datamarts or internal analytics. We use it as the endpoint for headless BI, as opposed to having to define and teach a DSL or GraphQL specification.\n~~~\nWe've built native funnel analysis on top of Hashquery and have been thrilled with it so far, and we thought others might want to use it too. It's pretty early days so we're still trying to explain it, and the docs aren't perfectly clear, but the examples on the dev site are editable and you can download the pip package to play around with it!\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40132424\nPoints: 49\n# Comments: 16",

My involvement has gradually snowballed since then. Off and on I've helped maintain various Life-related mailing lists and blogs, the Life Lexicon, and more recently the conwaylife.com forums and LifeWiki.\nAnother thing I stumbled into was helping Nathaniel Johnson complete an improbably thorough 480-page Conway's Life textbook, with end-of-chapter exercises and everything.  The book could be used to teach a college-level class on the subject. https://conwaylife.com/book/ has a free PDF download for the book.\nSo... I'm not the cleverest Lifenthusiast by a long shot, but for a random question about the Game of Life, I'm more likely to know something about it than at least 99.9999% of the world's population.

          "description": "I've been going through Cem Yuksel's \"Introduction to Computer Graphics\" course and thought that writing a volume renderer would be a good way to test my knowledge. It is a common technique used to render 3D medical data. Works by ray marching a specific step size, reading a 3D texture (e.g. MRI data), and calculating opacity values.\nCode should be easy to get started with for anyone familiar with the JS ecosystem.\nQuestions for the HN community: I spent 20-25% of the entire time just setting up the project and fighting issues with the JavaScript ecosystem. This experience has made me consider learning Cpp, Metal, and XCode. Has anyone made the transition from WebGL/TS to Cpp or done it the other way around? What was your experience with it? And what about debugging? That's a big issue with WebGL.\nAs for now, I'm thinking about picking up WebGPU next because it has an up-and-coming debugger made by Brendan Duncan[0] that looks promising.\nEdit: Anyone know why MRI data is sent via CDs and not the web? I started working on this project specifically because some people close to me got MRI scans and received CDs of their results. I know that some MRI data can be huge so downloading over the web doesn't make sense, but anything under 64MB should be sent over the web, no? For reference, I believe most MRI data can be under 250MB[1].\n[0] https://github.com/brendan-duncan/webgpu_inspector\n[1] https://www.researchgate.net/figure/Typical-image-dimensions...\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40107112\nPoints: 68\n# Comments: 24",

It generates a step-by-step tutorial guide for YouTube videos that you can follow along without watching long videos. Best suited for tutorial videos but can work for other videos aswell. No BS. Just straight to the point.\nThe guides are generated from pure transcript so you don't have to worry about it being AI. It's my first project as a total beginner. Something I had to do inorder to get out of tutorial hell.\nPlease let me know if you have any suggestions or if you face any problems or bugs. I would try to fix them to the best of my abilities and as soon as possible.\nI would appreciate your feedback on this. Let me know what you think!\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40104641\nPoints: 128\n# Comments: 48",

It doesn't take long and could change your life, like it did for me and many others.\nIn particular, if you have either of these two bogus thoughts, ignore them pronto and just go to https://apply.ycombinator.com and apply:\n(1) \"probably not good enough / won't get in\" - you'd be surprised at how many people feel that way, whether because of impostor syndrome, lack of credentials, whatever—and often they turn out to be among the best founders. So this a terrible reason not to apply!\nThe nice thing is, it's YC's job to evaluate that, not yours. They're looking for aptitude which doesn't look like what…",

          "description": "Hey all,\nI recently graduated from a good PhD program studying NLP. Unlike any sane person who would go become a professor or make a gazillion dollars in industry, I decided to try bootstrapping my own software business. This is my first product.\nThe inspiration was from my research on computers understanding social norms. When ChatGPT came out, I was amazed how well it could understand social etiquette. I thought it'd be fun to make a game where you have to talk your way out of sticky situations - like you miss your friend's birthday party, or your boss catches you trying to leave work at 2pm.\nI made a prototype in a couple days, and it was super fun to play with. I thought I'd spend a \"couple months\" making a game for others to play online. Now, only 10 months and 923.3 hours of work later, it's playable in early access.\nIn the game, you talk out loud (ASR), and the NPCs (LLM + TTS) talk back at you. It is fun to play with a friend! And because it's just talking, non-gamers do great, often better than gamers.\nI really want to have a free demo, but no time yet to implement. For now, it's purchase only ($4.99). If anyone decides to try it, I'd really love to get more feedback. It was an enormous learning experience, especially targeting the web - so many partially supported web APIs and browser inconsistencies! Still feels like 2008 in some ways.\nAlso happy to answer questions of course. Thanks, and enjoy the weekend!\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40091379\nPoints: 26\n# Comments: 8",

          "description": "Here's a project I've been working on for the last few months.\nIt's a new (I think) algorithm, that allows to adjust smoothly - and in real time - how many calculations you'd like to do during inference of an LLM model.\nIt seems that it's possible to do just 20-25% of weight multiplications instead of all of them, and still get good inference results.\nI implemented it to run on M1/M2/M3 GPU. The mmul approximation itself can be pushed to run 2x fast before the quality of output collapses.\nThe inference speed is just a bit faster than Llama.cpp's, because the rest of implementation could be better, but with a better development I think it can be a new method to speed up inference - in addition to quantization.\nYou could call it ad-hoc model distillation :)\nYou can change the speed / accuracy of a model at will, in real time.\nOh, and as a side effect, the data format allows to also choose how much of the model you want to load into the memory. You can decide to skip say 10-20-40% of the least important weights.\nIt's implemented for Mistral, it was also tested slightly on Mixtral and Llama. It's for FP16 for now, but Q8 is in the works.\nThe algorithm is described here, and the implementation is open source.\nhttps://kolinko.github.io/effort/\nI know these are bold claims, but I hope they survive the scrutiny :)\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40067677\nPoints: 183\n# Comments: 62",

It’s not a novel or a technical book. It’s a biography, a company’s biography. My hope is that it serves two purposes: to inspire founders and to captivate interior designers.\nIt all started three years ago. My wife and I were discussing interior design for our living room and she brought up what beautiful coffee table books should we have. After looking at her favorites I realized there’s nothing like this for tech startups. Digital products are intangible, how cool would it be to make them tangible and a beautiful art/decor book for your home office or living room?\nThis idea of consolidating my particular interests with my wife’s decorativ…",

          "description": "Hey folks,\nAbout a year ago my wife and I, both closing in on 40, quit our jobs at Red Hat to start a games company and learn game development. Many things happened along the road, and about a week ago we released our first (small) game on Steam.\nhttps://store.steampowered.com/app/2816120/Mazelit/\nThe demo is free to play up to level 8 (the final game plays up to level 80) and we'd appreciate any feedback you have, whether it's for the store page or the game itself.\nWe made the game in Godot 4.2 in roughly 3 months and I was working full time next to it. Since we ran into a bunch of roadblocks, we decided to also offer the entire source code up as a DLC in case someone wants to go look how we implemented the game, mod the game, or compile it for a different platform. The only thing we can't redistribute with the game code is the Steamworks SDK, which is available for download from Steam. (The game minus integration is fully runnable without the SDK, though.)\nCheers and happy weekend!\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40017180\nPoints: 19\n# Comments: 1",

          "description": "Hello everyone!\nAt a company I worked for, we needed to develop an MVP (basically a web page) and apply certain business logic to a Google Drive spreadsheet that was frequently updated by the Sales team.\nIn this case, we had two options:\nDevelop a backend to replace the current spreadsheet and have the sales team use it as a new \"backoffice\" - This would take a very long time, and if the hypothesis we were testing was wrong, it would be time wasted.\nCreate the web page and use Google's SDK to extract data from the spreadsheet.\nWe chose to go with the second option because it was quicker. Indeed, it was much faster than creating a new backoffice. But not as quick as we imagined. Integrating with Google's SDK requires some effort, especially to handle the OAuth logic, configure it in the console, and understand the documentation (which is quite shallow, by the way).\nAnyway! We did the project and I realized that maybe other devs might have encountered similar issues. Therefore, I developed a tool that transforms Google spreadsheets into \"realtime APIs\" with PATCH, GET, POST, and DELETE methods.\nSince it's a product for devs, I think it would be cool to hear your opinions. It's still quite primitive, but the basic features already work.\nhttps://zerosheets.com\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40014730\nPoints: 96\n# Comments: 53",

          "description": "Hi HN,\nmoved by curiosity about how to build an autonomous agent, and to explore the boundaries of machine creativity, I built a fictional entity (dubbed Livia) powered by LLMs, Multimodal models and text-to-image models to find some answers.\nWhat happened instead is that more questions have cropped up. An important hypothesis of this project is that, by observing the train of thought and witnessing the simulated state of mind and emotional emulation surrounding it, humans could empathize with a machine. What happens when that's the case? Would people enjoy companionship from a synthetic person? Would the Art establishment ever consider a non-human author (capable of making art and interacting with other humans) an Artist?\nWhatever the answers, I can't shake away the feeling that human uniqueness is being eroded and that we risk facing a crisis of meaning. Perhaps projects such as this help us demonize those fears, similarly to how sci-fi does, even though the boundary between fiction and reality is blurring.\nThis was a collaboration with Tibor (hn user: https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=tiborsaas).

          "description": "Here's a \"behind-the-scenes\" look at my development of a cool sensor during my PhD (electrical engineering). This sensor is only about 1/3 of my total research for my degree and took about a year.\nI've been on HN for a while now and I've seen my fair share of posts about the woes of pursuing a PhD. Now that I'm done with mine I wanna share some anecdotal evidence that doing a PhD can actually be enjoyable (not necessarily easy) and also be doable in 3 years.\nWhen I started I knew I didn't want to work on something that would never leave the lab or languish in a dissertation PDF no one will ever read. Thanks to an awesome advisor I think I managed to thread the needle between simplicity and functionality.\nLooking back, the ideas and methods behind it are pretty straightforward, but getting there took some doing. It’s funny how things seem obvious once you've figured them out!\nOh, I love creating GUIs for sensor data and visualizations as you'll see -- it's such a game changer! pyqtgraph is my go-to at the moment - such a great library.\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40003710\nPoints: 441\n# Comments: 90",

Ours is interesting because it's a latent diffusion model instead of a language model, which makes it more controllable: https://sonauto.ai/\nOthers do music generation by training a Vector Quantized Variational Autoencoder like Descript Audio Codec (https://github.com/descriptinc/descript-audio-codec) to turn music into tokens, then training an LLM on those tokens. Instead, we ripped the tokenization part off and replaced it with a normal variational autoencoder bottleneck (along with some other important changes to enable insane compression ratios). This gave us a nice, normally distributed latent space on which to train a diffusion transformer (like Sora). Our diffusion…",

          "description": "If you're feeling useless, remember that I exist.\nLet me give you some context. I work in the pipeline automation department of a company. Last month, our team decided to deprecate an internal tool due to several maintenance issues. So we created a pipeline that automates the implementation of this legacy tool, in case other teams needed to use it. (WHAT???)\nThis month, a guy in my team found some improvement scenarios in the automation. So I was chosen to implement this changes in this legacy internal tool.\nThe thing is, after I finished the adjustments, my pull requests are not getting approved due to adjustments meticulously requested by this guy in my team. Adjustments to make the pipeline automation even more resilient in complete unlikely scenarios.\nBut this same week, my TL sent notices to all the other teams informing them that this internal tool has been deprecated and they should no longer use it. So what sense does it make to have a pipeline automation that implements the use of the deprecated tool? And if it has been deprecated, why would I need to make an adjustment for the automation to be even resilient if no one should be able to use it anymore? So why am I being allocated to work on in such waste of time like it? (WTF???)\nThis makes me wonder, how many people have to work on something that they see no sense in doing at all.\nSo once again, if you're feeling useless, remember that I exist.\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39942397\nPoints: 184\n# Comments: 246",

          "description": "I used to work at Adobe on the infrastructure powering big applications like Photoshop and  Acrobat. One of our worst headaches was making these really powerful codebases work on desktop, web, mobile, and the cloud without having to completely rewrite them.  For example, to get Lightroom and Photoshop working on the web we took a winding path through JavaScript, Google’s PNaCl, asm.js, and finally WebAssembly, all while having to rethink our GPU architecture around these devices. We even had to get single-threaded builds working and rebuild the UI around Web Components. Today the web builds work great, but it was a decade-long journey to get there!\nThe graphics stack continues to be one of the biggest bottlenecks in portability. One day I realized that WebAssembly (Wasm) actually held the …",

In puzzle mode, you beat back your NPC opponent's words and take over their territory.\nTruncate started as a pen and paper game between a friend and I, evolved into a handmade board game, and finally arrived at an online puzzle game. Like any good word game, there is of course a daily mode, shareable with the tried and true grid of emojis\nWe've been playtesting it with friends and family for a few months, which has helped iron out the tutorials and gameplay, and we're finally happy with an MVP worth sharing!\nTechnical deets: The client and server are written in Rust, with the visuals built using egui (as an experiment in Rust's GUI ecosystem).\nWe'd love any feedback!\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39882873\nPoints: 126\n# Comments: 82",

We make it easier for product, engineering, and data teams to communicate their work. Here’s a video demo: https://youtu.be/yLCIo3jG2GM, and you can try it now at https://app.sandbox.thorntale.com without signing in.\nWhy? Because one of us (the data scientist) kept asking the other (a backend engineer) to move metrics from ClickHouse and CockroachDB, to Snowflake, to Looker, and then to Excel, so that she could make a chart in Excel for the BizOps team to screenshot, and finally stick in Google Slides. Besides being annoying for everyone, this produces inconsistencies and inaccuracies between the actual data and what got presented. We wasted three peoples’ time tra…",

          "description": "Hi HN, We're Luke and Phillip, and we're building Spice.ai OSS - a lightweight, portable runtime, built in Rust and powered by Apache DataFusion to locally materialize, accelerate, and query data tables sourced from any database, data warehouse or data lake.\nPhillip and I first introduced Spice on Show HN in September 2021. Since then, we’ve been schooled and humbled in every way building 100TB+ data and ML systems for the https://spice.ai cloud platform. Along with our customers, we struggled with getting fast, low-latency, high-concurrency SQL query within a budget, accessing and combining data from many sources, trade-offs between OLTP/OLAP compute engines, and managing datasets as code.\nToday, we’re re-launching Spice, completely rebuilt from the ground up, to directly solve several of the problems we had in accessing data quickly and cost-effectively  providing it to applications, dashboards, and machine learning. Spice provides federated SQL query across databases (MySQL, PostgreSQL, etc.), data warehouses (Snowflake, BigQuery, etc.) and data lakes (S3, MinIO, Databricks, etc.) with the ability to materialize remote datasets locally using in-memory Arrow, DuckDB, SQLite, or PostgreSQL. Accelerated engines run in your infrastructure giving you flexibility and control over price and performance.\nYou can read the full announcement blog post at https://blog.spiceai.org/posts/2024/03/28/adding-spice-the-n....\nWe’d appreciate it if you check Spice out, give us feedback, and if you'd like to contribute, we'd love to build with you.\nThanks!\nGitHub: https://github.com/spiceai/spiceai\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39854584\nPoints: 84\n# Comments: 20",

Here’s a quick demo: https://youtu.be/yrL3e1hgaNc, and here’s an even quicker one: https://youtu.be/giIaAxZp2M0.\nIf you’ve ever hired a lawyer, you know most of them bill by the hour—or more specifically, by the 0.1 of an hour (hence our name!). What most clients don’t realize is how painful it is for lawyers to track all their work in 6-minute increments.

          "description": "I finally did it. Took it right out back behind the woodshed and put it down. \n It put up one hell of a fight, though. The entire time I was moving files to backup to physical medium sharedrive kept freezing up the entire system trying to do whatever and sending me constant notifications (hey! Buy more storage!). Then antimalware/ ms defender had to get in on it, too. I swear it knew what was happening because notifications started flying at me like I’ve never seen before; articles from sites I’d never heard of, stock tickers, Google drive syncs. Each moment, each pop up or little “do du do” windows sound made me more and more excited to burn it all and start fresh. \n Then I had to disable secure boot, and spent several hours debugging an old Seagate SSD that was causing all kinds of weird problems when I was flashing it, or after flashing when I was trying to boot from it. I should have guessed by the xbox logo on this thing it was going to betray me. I still don’t know what the issue was, it’s working fine as storage and every scan says it’s cool but I broke down and bought a new usb and it worked on the first try, no driver issues or compatibility mode needed, no random “can’t read from HD0.” \n Now I’m up and running on a fresh Mint Cinnamon Edge and it is beautiful, fast, clean, customizable, and light as a feather. I feel like I just took a long hot shower. I’ve been playing with settings for the last hour and looking at rices. I can’t wait to load my source code on here and start doing graphics work, compile cpp code without jumping through a bunch of hoops, and to fire up a steam game and see how it plays without a bunch of bloatware running in the background. \n I’m never touching windows again unless I have to develop for it, and I’m going to take more steps into the open source ecosystem. This has been a great time and I love my new computer. Linux for life!\n    submitted by    /u/Creature1124  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "In the context of personal computers.\n As much as we'd love to see a world where everyone's PCs ship with Fedora or Mint or some other open-source, free operating system, let's be realistic here. Big hardware manufacturers want money. They WILL monetize an OS if at all possible -- Linux or not. They WILL happily preinstall an OS that pays them, if the option presents itself, and are not at all incentivized to maintain a free and open-source OS if money says otherwise.\n In a world where Linux becomes the dominant OS, what would that mean for us, the consumer?\n Would every hardware brand pull an Apple, and ship their own OS? Would an XPS run DellOS, a Galaxy Book run OneUI Linux, an HP Envy a HPOS, etc? As a hardware vendor, being able to preinstall your own locked-down operating system comes with many market pros, such as tighter hardware-software integration and easier implementation of tracking and monetization. Somewhat like the Apple style, where the Mac computer only ships with macOS.\n Or alternatively, would every brand pull a Windows? Would a single or handful of Linux distributions (say, Ubuntu) end up with enough cashflow to simply buy out the vast majority of PC vendors to include their OS preinstalled? And then get to maintain their market position due to consumer familiarity with their OS, as well as advertising/marketing revenue; meaning we'd end up in a world similar to how it is now, but with Ubuntu taking over what Windows' market role?\n    submitted by    /u/skyeyemx  \n [link]   [comments]",

If Intel doesn’t decide to kill it any time soon, I will be a long time user from now on.\n Fedora Silverblue has been lovely, it’s very refreshing how out of my way it feels. I don’t really have to worry about some app breaking my system, and rpm-ostree has been really nice, giving me all the informations I might need to know to get some app working properly.\n Working with Homebrew has also been quite nice, I like that basically all of the packages I tried to install, just work. On Ubuntu I had issues with brew, that I don’t seem to encounter on Fedora Silverblue.\n If you’re in the market to get a new GPU or to try a new distro I genuinely recommend them.\n What are you guys’ experiences with either ARC or Silverblue?\n    submitted by    /u/crocodus  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I am interested in using Linux USB Gadget to create virtual mass storage devices for use by a host system. The idea is that by using something like btrfs on the gadget side, the host system can be snapshotted regularly and transparently, while also uploading incremental backups to a remote site even when the host is powered down. Ideally, the host system should be completely unaware that it is being served virtual drives, so the theory is then that even if the host system gets hacked or infected with something like a ransomware, then you should be able to just flip a switch to undo it. Because the malware won't be aware that it's a virtual drive. \n I obviously understand that if you create an ethernet device, then the gadget would be open to all normal network attacks, but what about USB Mass Storage? If the host system is somehow able to detect that the drive is being served by a Linux USB Gadget rather than a normal dumb USB drive, what abilities would it have to attack the gadget system?\n    submitted by    /u/jo-erlend  \n [link]   [comments]",

Searching around it seems this issue has come up plenty of times over the years, but as far as I tell there are no satisfactory solutions.

It would bring lot of resources to linux but it would also bring lot of toxicity im afraid. Like many not so good people would try to insert themselves and their scummy stuff into linux, infiltrating it with its bullshit, slowly poisoning it. Or maybe someone big might try to privatize it or something to overtake it. Like i cant imagine what would have happened if instead steam some other company did what they did. Or this isnt really a threat? \n Sorry if this is common topic or if its not well written, i just got my daily dose of migraine..\n Edit: I would like to add that I know you can just hop on next distro but what if the big company makes us dependent on them somehow?

For context, I started using Linux fulltime about 2 years ago but I had never printed anything using it until today. I had to print some govt-related document on our office printer. I am pretty much the only one with Linux on my personal computer in this office for software-dev purposes which is my department.\n I had to ask a colleague how to use the printer and he had no experience with anything Linux. He simply told me, go to your laptop, connect to the same wifi as the printer and click print and it should work. \n I was a bit skeptical about the experience I was about to have since I have seen a lot of doom post about printers especially on Linux but also on Windows. \n I followed his instructions and in under 2 minutes I had printed all four documents I wanted. In full color, no configs, no tweaking, no messing around with weird settings. It just worked. I was amazed and I wished most of the Linux-related spaces like gaming and editing was this easy.\n ​\n    submitted by    /u/charonTheV  \n [link]   [comments]",

I am so happy and impressed that I am going to post about it. \n I have been patiently waiting for Blender to support my AMD GPU out of the box. After the upgrade, it does.\n I have been working around a nasty bug in Gimp for years, as well. Rounding the corners of a rectangle would cause a panic crash. I think it was caused by Wayland because it didn't seem to happen under X. After the upgrade, it appears the bug is fixed.\n The only hiccup that I had was needing to uninstall libapache2-mod-php8.2. Since Ubuntu 24.04 ships with php8.3. But that was very very minor. I'm not saying that I am not going to find a major pitfall tomorrow.

          "description": "Hi,\n Been using Mac and Windows for a long time. I decided to try Kubuntu after hearing about a new release. Boy was I surprised how polished it all feels. It still has the KDE feel from when plasma first debuted, but everything is really nice to use. So +1 to the KDE team on a nice desktop.\n I have this on an older laptop and even managed to get Hibernate working and found a reddit post on getting hibernate on the KDE power menu. But yea, I have a background in this stuff and I still feel like hibernate should be something that gets set up by default (or at leased asked) and creates the swap partition or file and automagically gets is created, updates grub and intramfs.\n It took some time to google these things and I got it all working, but I feel its the little things like this that hold Linux back from being more widespread.\n Other than that, this is my new little laptop computer. It's circa 2011. Runs great. No need to go to the landfill just yet.\n Anywho, I'm back on a LinuxOS, feels just like I never left. Long Live Konsole.\n Edit: I haven't used desktop linux since 2010'ish or earlier. Also sorry about not knowing the KDE version differences. The release news got me to at least try Desktop linux. And I still feel happy for doing that and I've been using it now for a few days. LocalSend and KDEConnect kind of blew my mind away that I can do things that I do with my Mac and iPhone with Linux.

          "description": "Unix is a simple and elegant OS and one of its core principals is to provide mechanism and avoid unnecessary policy decision. For example Microsoft Windows has an arbitrary policy that all executable should have .exe extension. In Unix any file can be an executable as long as it has the executable bit set. This philosophy was also followed when the original X11 was designed. The X11 server only provides mechanism, the actual look and feel of the desktop, or in other words the policy was left to the Window Manager (WM). The WM is a simple application which communicates with the X11 server via ICCCM (https://www.x.org/releases/X11R7.6/doc/xorg-docs/specs/ICCCM/icccm.html ). \n With Wayland the Window Manager and compositor are lumped together as one application. These are big applications with each having their own set of bugs and very little or no cooperation between the different compositor implementation. This rigid approach is also evident in a toolkit such as GTK which insists on client-side decoration (CSD) which again is an arbitrary policy decision.\n Seems to me that we have Microsoft Windows style developers working on the future Linux desktop and it will end up being as fragile and brittle as Windows.\n    submitted by    /u/Vasant1234  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "TL;DR for anyone not wanting to read: An NVIDIA user tries Linux and encounters issues.\n Not long ago, I decided that I wanted to make the switch to Linux. So I went ahead and installed with installed the proprietary driver. However, I encountered quite a few bugs, so I tried Fedora 39 KDE, also with the proprietary driver. Unfortunately, I still had no luck. I then decided to give Arch a try, and I installed it along with KDE. Yet again, I encountered various bugs. Here are the gist of the issues I experienced with NVIDIA across all distros:\n  \nIn Wayland, resizing and moving windows wasn't a problem, but it was glitchy. Most games I tried flickered, and Chrome also glitched when resizing or during normal use.\n X11 wasn't as glitchy as Wayland, but it was extremely slow in every aspect, especially when resizing or moving windows. I tried installing the explicit sync patch from the AUR, but it didn't make a significant difference. Then I remembered that I had an Intel iGPU in my CPU, so I connected my monitors to the motherboard. After reinstalling the OS (for some reason, the iGPU didn't work unless I logged in with my monitor/s connected to the dGPU), it worked. The desktop was running on Mesa, and I was able to run games on the dGPU through prime-run. Problem solved? Absolutely not. The games started stuttering, presumably due to the whole iGPU situation. In the end, I regrettably had to switch back to Windows. The only thing preventing me from using Linux right now is the NVIDIA driver.\n  \nI want to emphasize that this is not a support post, I do not expect support. I am simply sharing my experience using Linux with an NVIDIA GPU. I genuinely don't understand how some YouTubers can claim that there are no issues with NVIDIA on Linux, with some even recommending it for certain use cases.\n    submitted by    /u/NoSeK2323  \n [link]   [comments]",

Off I went down a rabbit hole of troubleshooting which ended with no solution other than X11. No solution lead to Distro search and tried every DE under Wayland, exact, same problem. At this point EndeavourOS KDE (manjaro would work but don't want to install it) works quite well but on and off, not consistently enough.

          "description": "I've poked around on the internet quite a bit but I've found very little information. Supposedly (as of over 10 years ago according to the few threads I've found) the scheduler is triggered every time the interrupt timer fires, which implies that adjusting the timer frequency changes the scheduler timeslice. Shouldn't that have an impact on latency/throughput? If that's the case:\n  \nWhy is it only settable at compile time? The kernel gained support for setting the preemption model at boottime and at runtime a while ago. Is the difference from changing the interrupt timer frequency that negligible that no one has bothered making it at least make it settable on the kernel command line even with a non-upstreamed patch? Is there some other technical reason? I have no idea if hardware supports changing it at runtime.\n \nDifferent distros set it to a different value. How much does this change influence their performance in different scenarios? To name a few, Debian and Ubuntu use 250Hz, Arch uses 300Hz, and Fedora and Void use 1000Hz. Of note, the XanMod kernel packaged for Debian/Ubuntu keeps the default 250Hz, which is interesting if aiming for the best latency.\n \n ​\n As far as I've looked, no one has done comprehensive benchmarks on the effect of changing the interrupt timer frequency. Does anyone know of any?\n    submitted by    /u/anh0516  \n [link]   [comments]",

Anybody else frustrated by this? Or am I just being sour over having to update my scripts and them suddenly modifying -n to match BSD was really that big of a benefit to warrant breaking years of backward compatibility on Linux?\n edit: since apparently the link doesn't really mention it much? The main issue that originally made me aware of the change is that the ignored files are no longer silent and cp/mv generate terminal output for each ignored file.\n Also, as /u/LvS and /u/pixelbeat_ mention below: apparently this behavior is rolled back in 9.5 and so is only an issue from 9.2 to 9.4 inclusive (with the old behavior patched back in for Debian version of the package).

          "description": "So, I watched a video today talking about a proposal on fedora to change the default DE from gnome to kde and they were advocating that it would be better for new linux users.\n I know many people don't like the opinionated nature of gnome or don't think kde is \"windows like\"... And that's fair. But since the point is about new users that mainly comes from windows I will give my point, as I am a relative new user coming from windows:\n When used to windows you are expecting things to behave like windows. Actually many people are not only used to, they do everything on a computer since they are born in windows... From gaming to academics. \n Then, when you try to change and find something very similar to windows (in terms of workflow) and things don't behave like windows, it brings a feeling that it's cheap or that it doesn't work, causing frustration or a sense of need to go back to windows. Doesn't matter that kde is in a very polished state today it will never behave exactly like windows, because it's linux.\n I say that because it happened to me when I tried to switch for the first time. (for other reasons I kept trying)\n So, on one of my attempts I tried gnome, and: \n it's so different from windows workflow (focus on workspaces, less menus, less minimize and maximize, concise visuals) my mindset changed and I started to face linux as an entirely different thing with a different paradigm.\n That's why I think gnome is a good choice for new users. Not because it's better thank other DEs but because it's different. If you are an user that needs to tinker more you will naturally go after something else after a while.\n Anyway, since then I moved to window managers and I'm happy, but it would not happened that easy if I kept trying to find windows on desktop linux.\n    submitted by    /u/bvgross  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I have been a windows user for past 20 years. About 3 months ago I finally decided to move to Linux from windows. I installed Fedora with Gnome on my main PC. I wanted to really give it a fair chance because I understand that it is completely different from windows. The installation process was great (wayyy better than windows in my personal opinion) I just had to install Nvidia drivers manually but other than that there was no problem. I loved the Gnome UI it looks beautiful and it is so fast and snappy and there is so much customisation. In the beginning I was scared of the terminal but I was actually quite surprised that I didn't even have to use it that much and in most cases there was a way to do the task through the GUI anyway. I loved that I could just go to the store to download the applications directly, no more going to Google to search for a site, then find a download link then download and all that crap. And that's where the good things end. I found that most of the time I was just fixing problems that I was experiencing instead of being productive. Davinci resolve would just crash out of nowhere, will start lagging or there will be random black screens. The hardest part was lack of apps. I can't work without office and the web versions weren't as intuitive. There are alternatives like libre office or open office but they lack a lot of advance features that I use. I use Nvidia broadcast a lot but the app isn't supported. File management is another thing that took me a long time to figure out but there are still problems that I wasn't able to solve. I really wanted to go through with it. I wanted to love the experience but I guess it just isn't for me.\n    submitted by    /u/Blluueee  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hey r/linux, with the recent news about the backdoor discovered in xz-utils, it got me thinking about Ventoy, a tool that makes it easy to create bootable USB drives for tons of ISOs, even pfSense and VMware ESXi are supported.\n I looked briefly at the source code, there are some red flags:\n  \nA lot of binary blobs in the source tree, even those that could be compiled from source (grub, zstd, etc). Always sketchy for a project claiming to be fully open-source.\n The Arch User Repository PKGBUILD for it is a monster - over 1300 lines! The packager even ranted that it's a \"packaging nightmare\" and complains that upstream expects you to build on CentOS 7.\n The build process uses ancient software like a 2008 version of device-mapper. WTF?\n  \nAll of this makes the source extremely difficult to properly audit. And that's scary, because a malicious backdoor in a tool like Ventoy that people use to boot their systems could be devastating, especially given how popular it's become with Linux newbies who are less likely to be scrutinizing the code.\n Am I being paranoid here? I'm no security expert, but I can't shake the feeling that Ventoy is a prime target for bad actors to sneak something in.\n    submitted by    /u/thwurx10  \n [link]   [comments]",

Both vacuumed to a month of data using 0.4 and 0.9 GB respectively. Both greps are just an ID and return 6 lines.\n rsyslogd:\n /usr/bin/time -v zgrep $EG /var/log/$APP* Elapsed (wall clock) time (h:mm:ss or m:ss): 0:00.06 Maximum resident set size (kbytes): 2,996 \n journalctl:\n /usr/bin/time -v journalctl -u $APP* --output=short --no-pager -g $EG Elapsed (wall clock) time (h:mm:ss or m:ss): 2:04.23 Maximum resident set size (kbytes): 366,144 \n Avoiding journalctl is 4 orders of magnitude faster and 2 orders of magnitude less RAM consumption. A log inspection script that takes a minute with rsyslogd would take a year with systemd. Clearly journalctl was not designed to scale, as it looks like it's loading the entire log history into RAM in chunks before answering. rsyslogd bins logs by app and date so only what is needed is read from disk, and only just enough lines at a time in RAM to benefit from buffer speed.\n Edit (thanks small_kimono ):\n Or at least avoid using any journalctl features:\n /usr/bin/time -v journalctl | grep -P \" $APP/.*$EG\" Elapsed (wall clock) time (h:mm:ss or m:ss): 0:21.11 Maximum resident set size (kbytes): 322,456 \n unlike unit, grep is not quite as horrific:\n /usr/bin/time -v journalctl -g $EG | grep \" $APP/\" Elapsed (wall clock) time (h:mm:ss or m:ss): 0:08.43 Maximum resident set size (kbytes): 317,452 \n Still 2 orders of magnitude worse for speed and RAM, so stick to rsyslogd if you have an nontrivial log operations.\n    submitted by    /u/elatllat  \n [link]   [comments]",

The most security conscious have been overtaken by a sense of unease, especially as the most obvious question is posed: \"how many times has this happened?\".\n This level of paranoia is certainly warranted, it always was as some are coming to realize, but I would like us all to remind people that systems are not only valuable due to their inherent robustness. Systems and software are also valuable, robust as well as secure due to the checks and balances within the processes that create them and act as fail-safes when said robustness is compromised.\n Some are looking for culpability in FOSS, but a point I feel we should echo louder is that although FOSS might have delivered on its weaknesses it also, and most importantly, delivered on its strengths. This time we were lucky, and this constitutes an opportunity to galvanize the FOSS community and strengthen the processes and principles that have moved it forward.\n I'd be happy to hear your thoughts!\n    submitted by    /u/jdsalaro  \n [link]   [comments]",

Every time I think to myself, if they just installed about any distro it’ll come with everything they’re looking for. I can’t give them this answer though because that’ll bring liability on the department if the nuke their system on accident and I just have to pitch Microsoft 365 since that’s what we sell. I’ve been using Linux along side macOS for a few months now and I don’t think I’ll ever go back to using windows because I’ve learned that everything I need can be used just as well if not better on Linux\n Edit: lots of great suggestions for open source options that’ll have windows support as well.

          "description": "**EDIT*\\* To be more specific, would antivirus protect potential user when the database is uploaded for this incident??**EDIT\n I understand that no Operating System is 100% safe. Although this backdoor is likely only affects certain Linux desktop users, particularly those running unstable Debian or testing builds of Fedora (like versions 40 or 41), Could this be a sign that antivirus software should be more widely used on Linux desktops?\n ( I know this time is a zero-day attack)\n *What if*, malicious code like this isn't discovered until after it's released to the public? For example, imagine it was included in the initial release of Fedora 40 in April. What if other malware is already widespread and affects more than just SSH, unlike this specific case?\n My point is,\n  \nMany people believe that Linux desktops don't require antivirus software.\n Antivirus can at least stop malware once it's discovered.\n Open-source software is protected by many parties, but a backdoor like this one, which reportedly took 2 years to plan and execute, raises my concern about being more cautious when choosing project code maintainers.\n Linux desktops will likely be targeted by more attacks as they become more popular.\n  \nIMO, antivirus does not save stupid people(who blindly disable antivirus // grant root permission) but it does save some lazy people.\n OS rely heavily on users practicing caution and up-to-date(both knowledge and the system). While many users don't follow tech news, they could unknowingly be running (this/any) malware without ever knowing. They might also neglect system updates, despite recommendations from distro maintainers.\n  \nThis is where antivirus software can be useful. In such cases, users might be somewhat protected once the backdoor signature is added to the antivirus database.\n  \nThankfully, the Linux community and Andres Freund responded quickly to this incident.\n    submitted by    /u/curie64hkg  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I have been a lifelong Windows user. I am a developer so I use a Mac for my work machine and Windows for everything else.\n I have a pretty beefy machine (4090, 32gb ram etc) so I've always used windows since I assumed that Linux\n  \nIs not ready for gaming yet\n isn't optimised\n Would be a nightmare to learn, not worth it\n  \nHoly hell was I wrong. I installed Pop!_OS around 5 days ago, and in that time, I have:\n  \nLearned far more console commands than I would have by sticking with Windows\n Borked my audio so had to re-install my OS\n Borked my steam so had to reinstall many times\n Borked Docker so had shutdown issues\n  \nBut, you know something? I learned something each time since I had to diagnose it and fix it, and it gets more fun each time because its a realization of I am in complete control of my system.\n That is something I never had in Windows. I am going to remain a dual booter since there is a couple games that only work in Windows annoyingly, but as of right now, I only have a 150gb partition for Linux, I will look into getting a 2tb SSD for it soon and hopefully make it my main OS.\n Every time I run into a struggle, there is a solution. The community is very helpful (apart from a few people on this sub reddit lol)\n Also, gaming has came a LONG way! Steam has Proton built in, so it means running Windows native games is a breeze (for the majority, at least)\n So, for anybody who needs that little push to give Linux a go, go for it! You won't regret it!\n    submitted by    /u/LordNadez  \n [link]   [comments]",

I was actively on the internet by using the iPod touch (before it was an iPhone) when they released WiFi capabilities on the Itouch. \n He got me a Chromebook and the very first thing I did was open google and head to oldschool.runescape.com. Jagex had JUST released OSRS and absolutely needed the nostalgia of flash1:wave2:cyan: buying gf1111!111!!!\n I was almost ready to play. All I had to do was install Java.

          "description": "I've recently been trying to better my understanding of core Linux concepts, and I want to test that knowledge... so, please help me out by critiquing my understanding of Firmware and Drivers.\n From what I've read, firmware is the code that makes hardware actually function on the lowest level, and it provides an API to simplify the general actions hardware can perform... like a speaker raising and lowering volume by altering input voltages. Then a driver's built to interact with that API endpoint to provide abstracted functionality of the hardware to the kernel.\n I think of this like interacting with a website. The website backend, like firmware, provides API endpoints for interacting with the websites core functionality (like reading and writing to and from databases). Then an example of a driver would be your browser & search engine interacting with the backend API to provide you with web pages, or to upload your data.\n I use to wonder why drivers didn't just interact with the hardware themselves, removing the need for firmware... but this would be the equivalent of your browser having to know how to run an sql query for user data on your websites backend, instead of having a backend API built by someone who can specifiy exactly how the database(s) should be interacted with, preventing any unsafe operations.\n    submitted by    /u/No-Tension2655  \n [link]   [comments]",

The official driver from Epson (which one again, soon will not work) hasn't faired any better.\n Even if the printing was perfect, there's no layout software, no way for me to truly visualize what my print will look like after tinkering with sizing and borders, no way to assign an ICC profile to the print.\n All that just to say I've been forced to use windows or my phone to actually get the printer to spit out anything decent, how exactly am I supposed to take the future of printing seriously when the only method that will be supported just flat out lacks crucial functionality?

          "description": "Hello all, recently I have been messing around with making x86 assembly programs, and I wanted to see how far I could get without linking any libraries, allocating any extra memory, only using x86 64 bit assembly, and without exceeding 1K of disk space. I won't go into the specifics of how I got the file size so low as that would be more appropriate for another group of people like r/asm or the people of GitHub (should I get a GitHub account and post the source there?), All that I'll mention here is that I succeeded and got the file size down to 977 bytes, and the steps to run it from that qrcode up there.\n Yep, I did what a few people have done when it comes to small programs, notably MattKC and Dave's Garage and put my little webserver in a qrcode.\n Warning: I trust my code to be safe and free of malware, but you shouldn't. Do not run any code you find online on your own machine. Please use a VM or a disposable device.\n Now to those of you who have either of these things (or just don't care) heres what to do.\n 1: scan the qrcode with zbarimg -1 --raw -Sbinary path/to/png > path/to/exe\n Note: zbar had an issue quite a while ago where it would fail to read qrcodes like this making the program unable to be run, please update zbarimg to the latest version or build it from source.\n 2: make it executable with chmod +x path/to/exe\n 3: run it with ./path/to/exe\n 4: connect to it. The port should be port 4050 so connecting to it should be as simple as going to localhost:4050 or 127.0.0.1:4050 in your webbrowser.\n I might make a GitHub account and post the source there. I'm just not sure that making a GitHub account souly for a Makefile and a 200 line asm file is a good idea.\n Either way, I hope you like it.\n    submitted by    /u/Skeleton590  \n [link]   [comments]",

Just in case.\n Besides the fact that this seems utterly backwards on a server-class operating system like Linux, which is now even capable of updating the kernel without reboot via an appropriate service, to regress back to unnecessary consumer-desktop-class behaviour, isn't this also counter to the whole purpose of their \"snap\" format?\n In that containers seek to further isolate components from one another, so you can restart a container to refresh it, without needing to touch anything else about the system.

Support Inkscape's development: https://inkscape.org/support-us/donate/\n A lot of issues remain to be found and solved, especially on MacOS and Windows, so the next release will still use GTK3.

If not, how would it be compromised, most likely?\n EDIT: Once again, this is a magical thought experiment land where rubber hoses, lead pipes, and bricks do not exist and cannot be used to rearrange teeth and bones.\n I understand that beating the password out of the journalist is the most practical way of doing this, but this question is about technical capabilities of Linux, not about medieval torture methods.\n    submitted by    /u/JimmyRecard  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Does not necessarily have to be something big. Just something that was added or changed that has made your interaction with the OS, a more positive experience. Something that you notice. \n For me, it was Pixel's select text, copy links, and images from recents. \n Makes text selection super convenient and quick. You can also quickly share a link with someone right from the recents. Or copy an image to paste it somewhere else. Did not think much of it when it was first introduced, in fact, I did not like it at first, and wanted the old, predictive 5 shortcuts back. Now I find this feature so convenient that I don't know if I would be able to switch to a non-pixel phone because of it. \n Also, strangely the Media Picker introduced in Android 13. I remember before it was added, it was being hyped up, and I have to say, it has lived up to it. I use it almost daily, and I really like it. I like its UI and how it integrates third party apps too. So you can use, for example, Simple Gallery to select the image/video. It has search and convenient filtering pills for filtering media types. It's very well thought out.\n    submitted by    /u/DiplomatikEmunetey  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "2024 ，第 16 周，0415-0421\n快四个月了，终于叫了一次外卖，只为 EVA 而破例。\n\n提前预告一下，下周我要出去旅游一周，所以周记 63 延后一周，周记和游记一起放出。\nGoogle Play 上的两个好消息\n极简时钟在 GP 上最近一个月一直在下降，日下载量几乎要跌破 1K 了。于是发布了一个更新 sdk 的版本，效果立竿见影，下载量立刻拉升回来。\n\n极简日记在 GP 上几乎没人下载，每天下载量就是个位数。不过最近才发现下载量剧增，最高的一天达到了 169 ，增长率 1000%+，哈哈哈！看了一下国家，没想到居然是菲律宾。\n\n极简日记 App Store\n这一周的所有开发工作都花在了极简日记上，而且是按下葫芦起了瓢。\n从上周开始就一直在修复极简日记的 bug ，但是刚修好一个，就立刻引出了另一个，每天都在这种反复中，心情很是崩溃。\n归根结底，还是基础知识太差，于是向其他开发者虚心请教，看 blog 和视频。\nHow to use Core Data with MVVM Architecture in SwiftUI\nTransformable types\nHow to renew an expired certificate with Fastlane Match\n好在是在周日把这个版本需要解决的 bug 都清掉了，虽然解决的方式非常不优雅，但是可以安心出去旅游了。\n极简时钟 iOS 价格调整\n上周看完了 RevenueCat 关于 App 内购定价的总结和分析，我就想着更改一下极简时钟的内购价格。\n国内只调整了年订阅的价格，由 30 降为 18 。\n国外的价格全面与世界接轨，月订阅改为 0.99 美元，年订阅改为 3.99 美元，终身买断改为 8.99 美元。\n然而，我又犯了之前同样的错误，把终身买断价格改成了 App 价格……价格是晚上改的，而我又是第二天早上才发现，居然还有 5 个购买……唉，这下导致全球的排行榜又被清空了。上次的这个操作，导致极简日记还在持续清榜中，已经 23 天了……\n减肥\n体重终于突破了 190 ，达到了新低 188 ，主要靠的是有两天没吃晚饭。\n周日的时候终于看了《热辣滚烫》。这一次减肥的目标是在元旦定下来的，不过在这部电影上映时确实也受了很大激励，但是一直没有空去电影院看。当时我就预估今年一定会掀起一波健身热潮，不知道这一波热潮过了没有。我的健身房倒是一直冷冷清清的，不过我的观察可能也是幸存者偏差，因为我是专门挑人少的时候去。\n我的左小臂外侧的肌肉一直疼，看肌肉图应该是叫尺侧腕屈肌。疼了大半年，我一直以为是玩游戏手柄造成的。周一在健身房搬杠铃的时候，这块肌肉突然咯嘣一下，我还以为拉伤了，过了两天居然一点也不疼了……神奇！\n游泳有两个突破。一是第一次达到 1000 米，之前每次最多游 30 分钟，为了达成 1000 米的目标，延长到了 44 分钟。另一个是连续游泳距离第一次尝试 100 米，之前都是每游 50 米就歇一会。\n\n周二的时候，天气难得的好，于是出去沿着河边溜达了一大圈，一路边走边拍。来回差不多有 10km ，但是 Apple Watch 在 5km 的时候就没电了，后面的数据就都没记录上……",

          "description": "这些天整理重构了一下子之前复活的微信机器人的代码，一开始是参考别人写的项目代码，模块系统属于 CommonJS 规范，我在入门 JS 的时候，直接学的 ES6 ，所以对该系统不是很熟系，重构成 ES6 后相信后续开发会愉快不少。\n我把源码发布在github上，与其他成熟的项目对比，它很小，主要功能聚焦在对话上，能接入 chatgpt 对话，还能在微信内设置 AI 角色来调教输出结果。\n我有心想给它拓展一些功能，但是好像都没找到合适的需求点。我原本要解决的问题是，在手机上使用生成式 AI ，特别是 chatgpt ，没有电脑方便，要么科学上网后通过官方 app ，要么打开浏览器上官网使用，这两种看起来都不是很优雅（很懒）地使用方式，如果只是对话的话，集成到即时通信软件（比如微信），我觉得是一个很好的解决方案，诸如此类像同义千问，就被集成到钉钉里，还有 IDE 里的一堆 AI 插件。不必再多下载一个 app ，多开一个网页，直接在已有软件上对话，多流畅啊。\n后面开发上线，只有我一个人用，感觉有点浪费，因为注册之后 openai 会给你免费 5 美元额度，正常频率的话能用一段时间，但是存在有效期，想着过期还蛮可惜，于是我把机器人发布在校内表白墙上，不成想用的人还真不少，额度提前刷光了，为此我还找第三方付费。\n用的人多，那我能不能付费后，再将接口转发供给他们调用呢，（只能在微信里使用）然后我收取一些费用，不奢望它使人财富自由，若是能平衡服务器租用和大模型的费用，我也知足了。\n商业逻辑清晰后，我便匆匆地制作了一个 MVP ，发布初步定价¥2 元/月，不付费用每用户每日限定五次对话。意想不到的是，上线后付费的人可以说是寥寥无几，而且原本免费使用的人群也逐渐减少，现在是一个半死不活的状态。哪里出现了问题，至今没有搞清楚。",

          "description": "很久没登录 V2EX ，主要是国内不用点技术访问不了，还是很怀念 V2EX 的氛围，所以我又打开了它，没想到账号密码还记得登录成功。\n翻看了下论坛，感兴趣的话题并不多了，没 20 来岁那会儿的热情了，\n从一个懵逼少年到现在 35 岁，感觉一眨眼的事儿，我估计许多人也有同感，不知道现在论坛的群体年龄怎样，\n也翻看了一些 35 主题的帖子，\n有人说要把代码一直写下去的和自己儿子一起写代码的\n也有的说 35 了技术不行，只会 crud 肯定找不到工作\n有的说 40 多了没感受到职业危机\n当然也有的人很反感这个话题，很多年前提过一嘴被人说是贩卖焦虑，而如今是真的 35 了，回过头再看这个问题，\n35 不可避免，还是要面对现实，每个人情况不同，选择适合自己的路子\n目前认知到的问题\n1 ） 35 了，学历是硬伤，市面上要求本科起步，跟 10 年前相比较，学历更重要了\n2 ）计算机行业，35 了如果还出去找工作，身边的同事都比自己年轻，领导搞不好还是个 00 后，被呼来唤去的，说句心里话，有点不对味儿了，国外环境另当别论，国内环境先不说自己感受，年轻人也会有异样的眼神\n3 ）大环境确实不太好，目前的行业跟前些年没法比，之前互联网是香饽饽，而当前好的方向在新能源，芯片等领域，属于制造业，想往这个行业靠拢，技术上需要更新学习，而制造业的职业寿命无非比互联网行业多 10 年甚至 5 年，所以学与不学，也需要斟酌\n前些年，也一直在思考这些问题，终究是没有一个好的结果，这些年疫情和经济下滑，收入也是锐减，失业离职也都是在眼前的问题。\n好在房贷还完了一套，还有一套一个月 4k 的月供，想着当个保安也还的起，至少是妻儿老小都可以在一个城市，没事儿逛逛公园，露营一下，也算幸福，\n想想上学那会儿没日没夜的研究新技术，现在早已经对技术失去兴趣，不再愿意花时间到学习技术上，\n对技术失去兴趣的原因也很明确，如果 35 了跑去再找份技术类工作去做，也不太现实。\n回过头再看 35 岁危机\n一些行业是越坚持越会有积累价值的，比如给人看病的医生，我希望我的医生经验更丰富一些，资历更老一些\n而计算机技术，迭代速度太快，人员迭代速度也太快，就技术经验价值远不及医生教师之类的工作人员。n 年前年写个 div+css 都觉得先进，而如今 vue 吧啦吧啦\n回头看在技术这条路上，其实不能只关注技术本身，更多的是要研究业务，盈利模式，自己是否可以做，是否可以拉小伙伴去做盈利几率更大更高的事情，尽可能用美好的青春 10 年，换到更大的利益价值，以便后期有金钱资本去做其他事情。而我是错失了一次次机会的。所以今天的 35 危机，也怪之前只看技术，不关心盈利的业务。\n有句话叫，花无百日红，人无千日好，所以人在好的时候更应该想着，找个更好更稳的路子\n35 岁要跳出困局，更多的是要做升华的事情:\n如果之前我积累了几百 w ，（确实也积累到了只是都在房子上车子上）除去房子车子，如果我还能有几百 w 闲钱，我会去创业。\n以前是自己学了本领再找工作，再到行业不行了,最后失业。\n而 35 岁挑战会更大，不可能从 0 再学另一门东西再去找工作打工，最后再失业，这其实是没有成长的，人生也不会精彩。\n前些年，考虑到这些问题，于是乎，就让自己家人去做了市场，考察什么东西好创业，利润高行业发展前景好，家人前前后后也干了几份工作，最终也发掘到好的行业，至今也觉得好，但没去行动，感觉自己准备的还不够。\n感觉到危机时，也曾和别人一起开过小店，并没赚到钱也没亏钱，但是赚到了与人合作要考虑到的问题。\n未来的路要怎么走，我也想好了\n有钱就去闯，去试错，\n没钱就尽可能找个躺平的事情，跟家人平安度过这一生。",

          "description": "我有个一直在做的通知网关项目 Heimdallr，这几天 star 多了很多，发现在什么值得买有个博主介绍了我的项目，然后在评论里发现有人提到，配置太多了，看不明白。\n我之前一直想做一个前端页面来进行配置的管理，但是这个项目的首要考虑之一就是“轻量”，所以没有使用数据库，也不想做 CRUD （多没意思）。同时，我本身是后端，对前端的理解仅停留在会写一点点 HTML 和 CSS ，所以一直很没有动手写过完整的前端网站。针对配置管理，朋友给了我一个灵感——一个生成 nginx 配置的网站。\n做一个前端页面来生成配置就好了！趁热打铁，我花了大概十个多小时，通过和 GitHub Copilot 合作，上线了一个前端网站 —— Heimdallr Configurator，如下。它的功能就是在左侧编辑通知渠道和分组，右侧同步生成可以直接使用的配置文件，提供复制和导出功能。\n \n以下是一些我总结的技巧：\n你来指路，他来解决细节\n我一直觉得 Copilot 这个名字取得很好，它的角色不是代替程序员进行编写，而是在程序员的指导下完成繁复的部分。作为机长，你需要了解你的目的地，以及途中经过的路标——对应地，你需要知道最终完成的效果，以及如何分步去完成。\n在我的例子里，我知道需要先把页面分成左右两栏，左边做一个 tab ，底下一列卡片，每个卡片里放一个表单；右边做一个文本框和几个按钮，文本框实现同步左边表单变动生成配置内容，按钮实现复制、导出和重置功能等。将步骤拆分好后，再通过 Copilot 逐个去实现。\n选对上下文，事半功倍\nCopilot Chat 有一个选择上下文的功能，在光标没有选中文本时，上下文取当前窗口可见的行，选中了文本时，上下文为选中的文本（可以选中整个文件的全部文本），但是不能跨文件获取上下文。\n当你不选择上下文时，Copilot 往往没法给出很具体的建议，它只会给出几个可能的原因。如果你碰巧不熟悉，一个个排查会浪费很多时间。如果你选择的上下文不对，Copilot 无法从中判断到有效信息，它会提示你，这时候重新选择，然后追问即可。在你不知道 bug 在哪里的情况下，可以先选中一段可能有问题的地方，描述问题，如果它表示这里没问题，再选择另一段追问即可。\n给清晰指令，避免误解\n尽量用简短的技术语言去描述你的需求，而不是自然语言。虽然大模型的能力能让它大致能理解“外行发言”，但正确的术语能避免它第一次给出的结果不满意的情况。例如上面写布局的例子，如果不指定使用 Tailwind CSS ，它给出的例子很可能是用原生的 CSS 写的。\n另外，我个人建议使用英文与 Copilot Chat 交流，个人觉得交流起来更加方便、精准。而且有时候你跟它说中文，回答可能还是英文。\n写好注释，面向自然语言编程\n在代码比较简单的时候，也可以不用 Copilot Chat ，直接打注释。\n篇幅有限，具体示例可以移步我的博客查看： https://ameow.xyz/archives/develop-a-frontend-site-with-copilot\n如果你对文中提到的项目感兴趣，这里是它们的地址。\nGitHub - LeslieLeung/heimdallr: 一个非常轻量的通知网关，可以聚合各种推送渠道，使用 Serverless 部署，几乎零成本运行。\nGitHub - LeslieLeung/heimdallr-configurator",

          "description": "一开始用的 oneNote ，因为跟 office 配套，所以自然而然的用了 3 年多。oneNote 可以创建无限个标签，同时标签里可以创建无限个页，页可以嵌套无限个子页，每一页的内容也是可以无限扩展的，这在当时非常惊艳，也有各种大神做出了很精美的日记页面。\n我一度为了这个软件，买了当时微软最火的硬件 surface ，在 surface 上 oneNote 是最好用的。因为 surface 支持手写，我很享受在电子设备上有书写的感觉。\n但是它也有几个致命的缺点，我用的是桌面版，微软后来莫名其妙的砍掉了，新功能比如 markdown 不再支持，二是由于国内同步速度一直是个迷，有时候快，有时候很慢，不得不依赖于第三方的同步方案，例如坚果云才能勉强实现多端同步，遂逐渐放弃。\n有道云笔记\n工作之后就开始转向国产笔记软件了，用了大概 5 年的有道云笔记。界面很清爽，基本没有任何广告，让人觉得这软件只能用来记笔记，简单高效。操作习惯符合国人，当时它的网页插件有道云笔记剪辑很好用，在一个网页上直接点击，文章就会被保留格式并自动同步在笔记里。同时多端同步速度很快，电脑上编辑的，手机上能很快显示出来。\n但是用久了发现也有一些问题，5 年前的文章再打开，页面很慢，内容长时间才响应，剪辑功能逐渐不好用了，基本是无响应的状态，文章查看不方便，只能是一个文件夹一个文件夹的去找。\n这样的困惑，让我很长时间都没有记录新的内容了，找不到合适的载体，就不想记录，而且现在记录的越多，以后迁移就越麻烦。直到去年接触了笔记软件 obsidian ，我才发现找到了新的天地。\nmarkdown 格式\nobsidian 用的是 markdown 格式的，我用这个软件前，没接触过 markdown ，直到用了几次后，才发现它很简单，就是一种格式。格式会体现在文件的后缀上，比如图片一般是 jpg,png 格式的，电影是 mp4,mkv 格式的，像之前的 oneNote 用的 one 格式的，有道云笔记的文件我没有找到。\n在我看来，markdown 有两大好处\n一是上手简单，它有自己的语法，但是你不必完全掌握，一上来你可以就把它当做是一个记事本来写，非常简单。当你需要什么功能时，比如要有小标题，比如文本高亮，再去找相应的语法。语法也非常简单，因为它是标记语言，所以几个标签就能解决问题。\n二是这个格式是通用的，意味着迁移成本很低。上文说到的格式问题，各个软件公司都不通用，都有自己的专门格式。如果哪一天你要换个笔记软件，如果你在这个软件上有上千篇的文章，迁移过程只能手动，或者看看有没有大神有对应的脚本，没有的话非常低效，会让人崩溃。而 markdown 不存在这个问题，即使有一天这个 obsidain 软件公司倒闭了，我也能很快迁移到另一个软件上，比如 typora ，笔记内容很快就能显示出来。\n本地\n放在本地的好处是，一是加载快，直接读取本地的内容，而不必通过网络请求，尤其是在你网络不好的情况下，就会出现页面内容显示时间过长的尴尬。我之前用过一段时间的 notion,在网络很好的情况下，能很快打开内容，而在网络不好，页面长时间不响应，当你想快速查找一个内容的时候，内容显示不出来，这任谁都忍受不了。\n第二个是隐私的问题，不管是有道云笔记，还是 oneNote ，都是放在别人的服务器上，尤其是一些国产的服务器，会存在对应的审核，比如语雀创建笔记或者是分享给别人的时候会提示正在审核中，有时候就会提示分享失败，如果审核认为你存在敏感内容，就会删除对应的内容甚至是对应的笔记。如果记录的是一些教程或者是工作笔记，看就看了，当我们写一些私密性的东西，肯定不想被别人看到吧。",

          "description": "大家好，我是 Python 猫 的主理人，目前在创作《 Python 潮流周刊》。\n之前曾说周刊不做订阅制的，现在却推出了订阅专栏。今天想为自己辩护一下，同时聊聊技术周刊今后的发展计划。如果你在读后感兴趣，欢迎订阅！\n首先回顾一下我过去的想法吧，然后再解释为什么会突然出现转变。\n出于对 Python 的热爱以及对国外几个 Python 周刊的效仿，我从一年前开始连载《 Python 潮流周刊》。在这段时间里，我一直有把商业变现放在心上，只不过它的优先级并没有太靠前。\n我一边想着先把内容做好先积攒影响力，一边看着几份英文 Python 周刊的变现模式而盲目乐观着。\n在发布第 30 期之前，我侥幸接到了一两期商业赞助，那时我得意以为终于要熬出头了，终于可以像那些英文周刊一样，用“免费+品牌赞助”的方式运营了。\n于是意气风发地写了一篇《聊聊技术周刊的变现》，那时的我完全没有意识到下面的话是多么的理想主义：\n我比较在意的回报有两类，而且希望能同时得到，一类是关注量、阅读量、star 数、点赞量等等数据带来的精神鼓舞，另一类是广告/恰饭带来的实实在在的金钱。\n回到周刊变现的话题，因为第一类回报，所以我不打算做私密性周刊，不打算用订阅制，不打算收会员费；因为第二类回报，所以我会坚持探索挣钱之道。\n以上说法归结起来其实就是：我不想向读者收费，只想向广告主收费。\n如果我的读者群体已经很大了，如果每期阅读量都稳定很高了，比如像《科技爱好者周刊》和《 HelloGithub 》那样，这条路也许会顺畅很多。\n但现实是，Python 编程在国内的受众还是偏少，能关注到 Python 猫的也不算多，而最近两三年来，Python 类广告投放也出现了断崖式萎缩。\n或许因为我的内容太过垂直于 Python 领域，导致其它技术方向的广告主望而却步了，同时又因为不够垂直于爬虫/数据分析/AI 等几个热门的培训…",

          "description": "作为一个开发者，经常需要在多个设备之间传输文件/文本之类，我有 4 个手机两台电脑，相互传输个文件，非常不方便，当时（ 2020 年的时候）记得也有一些跨平台传输工具，但是都差点意思，要么只有手机端，要么只有网页，还特别不稳定，其实当时就想做这个产品，无奈不会桌面端，就一直忍受着这种不方便，用微信 QQ 之类的工具传输，虽然不是高频，但是需要用到的时候真的是特别苦恼。\n2023 年的时候，我经历了 Flutter 从 0.9 - 3.0 版本，表现越来越稳定，生态越来越健全，想要的功能插件基本上都能找到，使用 Flutter 开发桌面端的软件也越来越多，一直用 Flutter 做移动端的我，总是做做桌面端，看看 Flutter 的表现如何，同时也能满足文件传输的需求，由于是业余时间做，所以这个项目从开始要上线，用了大概 8 、9 个月的时间，中间因为各种事情，搁置了一段时间，iOS 开发账号注册又弄了 2 个月，从年初到年底，终于是上线了，看着自己做的产品终于要面世了，还是有点激动的，这款产品耗费了很多精力和时间，也满足了我的所有需求，而 Flutter 的表现是远超出我的预期，同时也墙裂建议同学们如果有做多端需求的项目，上 Flutter 。\n其实产品开发了一半的时候，github 上发现了 localsend ，因为也是 Flutter 开发的，体验了一下，当时就坚定了我继续用 Flutter 开发桌面端，因为体验确实还不错，虽然交互确实有点麻烦，不够易用，但是总体来说还行。\n去年年底上线后，为了更好的体验，又内部测试了一段时间，从体验上继续优化，，每天也是高频使用，我想把核心功能做到极致，我不想再像之前一样电脑上传个文件到手机上抓耳挠腮的半天没弄好，针对移动端和桌面端不同的交互习惯，分别做了非常多的细节处理，可能你永远不会发现。\n由于国内的繁杂手续，我们短时间内不会上架国内（海外走上正规了再上架国内市场），正好也尝试一下海外市场，感受了一下‘出海’氛围，目前还在公测阶段，基本上没任何推广动作，这样目前已有十几个国家的用户付费，给了我很大的震撼，果然是海外用户付费意识成熟。\n我们想要做的是：现代设计、极速稳定、打开即用的跨平台文件传输工具\n也会一直保持这个理念完善产品。\n最后: 上链接：Airclap\n如果觉得还可以的话，帮忙点个 star，感谢各位。",

          "description": "什么是新流系列软件\n当下越来越多的应用搬到了云上，这给用户带来了方便，但也带来了一些问题。\n第一，用户的数据和隐私安全问题。云上的应用，数据和应用的控制权由软件厂商牢牢把控，用户在软件厂商面前如同裸奔，对用户的数据和隐私安全的保护，全靠软件厂商的良心。大家知道，国内的软件厂商通常是没有良心的。国外的可能有点，但也不多。\n第二，没完没了的付费问题。云上的应用走的都是互联网的老套路，先免费，等到你被平台深度绑定的时候，再收费。不交钱？那就加广告，再各种限制你，反正有的是办法。订阅制的付费模式，只要你还在使用，就要一直付费，长期来看，使用成本还是很高的。\n新流系列软件是对软件模式的一种新的探索，它的目标是在用户的数据和隐私保护，跨设备使用便利性，以及软件使用成本上取得一种平衡，给用户更多一种的选择。\n简单来说，新流系列软件遵循三条新流软件标准\n第一，不注册，不联网，本地存储，离线运行，是完全的本地应用程序。用户拥有对数据和软件绝对的控制权，用户的数据和隐私安全也有绝对的保障。\n第二，支持 Windows 、macOS 、Linux 、iOS 、Android 、Web 等几乎所有主流平台。通过新流互联，支持在任意平台间进行应用流转和数据流转。\n第三，拒绝订阅制，告别没完没了的付费。一次付费，所有平台永久使用，永久可用。\n关于新流密码\n新流密码是一个密码管理应用，它完全遵循了新流软件的三大标准，本地存储，离线运行，多平台支持，跨设备访问。买断制，相对订阅制也能很好的降低用户的使用成本，特别是对于密码管理这种使用频度很低的应用来说。\n在功能上，新流密码支持多账号，方便小号管理。支持安全密码生成，支持查看密码历史。对了，还支持添加附件，这在保存一些证书，密钥时会非常有用。\n在进行跨平台访问时，对数据的点对点传输都进行了加密，以保证数据安全性。\n在使用上，建议用户将应用安装到手机上，当需要跨平台使用时，通过新流互联，将应用流转到其他平台上进行使用。\n关于新流互联，新流互联支持基于局域网或者 IPV6 公网内的跨设备访问，支持DDNS 动态域名绑定，通过自定义域名访问设备。（根据我的观察，目前手机蜂窝网络分配到的已经是 IPV6 地址了，家庭宽带也都基本支持 IPV6 。）\n为什么想写一个密码管理应用\n还记得很多年以前，我只有一个银行卡密码。再后来有了电脑以后，就是几个社交账号论坛的密码。再到后来互联网流行了以后，各种密码也是越来越多了。直到最近几年，特别是云计算流行了以后，什么东西都上了云了，就什么东西都变成了账号密码了。。。\n密码越来越多以后，忘记密码的事情就时有发生。于是就用了 LastPass ，我把我所有的密码都放在了上面。其实我也不怎么用它，平时我都是登录以后就记住密码的。只有在换了新设备或者重装系统以后，偶尔登上去，查一下密码。这个 LastPass 安不安全我不好说，但是因为是国外的软件，每次登录都特别的慢，而且只要换了 IP 登录，就要验证邮箱，非常繁琐。最近几年更是经常爆出被黑的新闻，心里总还是有点担心的。于是就有了今天的新流密码。\n大概就是这样了吧，相关截图和下载地址可以访问 新流软件官网: https://www.xinflow.cn",

          "description": "先发图，证明有车，不是无车黑。\n\n一、以大家最了解的油车为例子，油车驾驶过程，可以分为三种状态：\n1.加速 2.滑行 3.刹车\n我这里就不提其他电车了，免得更乱，只提特斯拉。特斯拉的驾驶过程，只有两种状态：\n1.加速 2.刹车\n有油车用户说：动能回收，跟我滑行，有什么区别？\n答：你那个滑行，能滑很远，特斯拉松了刹车也就滑百十米，真的不一样。\n明确的说：特斯拉日常驾驶中，不能备刹车，备不了。动能回收开到弱，也备不了，特斯拉的弱动能回收，其实也不弱。\n当然不排除有人为了抬杠，开到 100 多，把脚挪过去呆几秒，没必要，真车主都知道啥情况。\n----\n以上说的是单踏板吗？不是，只是很多人连上面的都没绕明白。\n----\n二、那到底什么是单踏板，不是动能回收吗？\n答：动能回收+保持模式，才是单踏板。\n保持模式是特斯拉的一个设置项，有 3 个选项：\n1. 缓行 2.转动 3.保持\n缓行：挂挡后，不踩油门，车辆也可以慢慢往前走。(大部分油车就这样)\n转动：挂挡后，不踩油门不走，斜坡会溜。\n保持：挂档后，不踩油门不走，斜坡不会溜。（传说中的单踏板模式）\n选择保持模式后，车子就可以做到：\n- 抬脚刹车，可以完全减速为 0 ，所以可以全程不踩刹车踏板\n- 抬脚刹车，可以完全减速为 0 ，所以可以全程不踩刹车踏板\n- 抬脚刹车，可以完全减速为 0 ，所以可以全程不踩刹车踏板\n选择缓行模式，车子：\n- 抬脚刹车，但无法完全减速为 0 ，想要停车还得踩刹车踏板\n- 抬脚刹车，但无法完全减速为 0 ，想要停车还得踩刹车踏板\n- 抬脚刹车，但无法完全减速为 0 ，想要停车还得踩刹车踏板\n这就是保持和缓行的区别，也是真正的单踏板模式。\n----\n以上说的是完整的单踏板模式吗？依然不是。以上只是客观的进入单踏板模式。\n- 上面都是完全客观内容，没有一丝主观的偏向。下面会加入主观评价。\n- 上面都是完全客观内容，没有一丝主观的偏向。下面会加入主观评价。\n- 上面都是完全客观内容，没有一丝主观的偏向。下面会加入主观评价。\n----\n上面还不算单踏板的完全态，那什么才是呢？\n答：认为单踏板模式是更先进的驾驶方式，才是完全态。\n因为这句话的另一个意思是：双踏板是落后的驾驶方式。\n- 进入这个状态后，会坚持避免使用另一个踏板，长期不踩刹车踏板，长达数月。\n- 进入这个状态后，会坚持避免使用另一个踏板，长期不踩刹车踏板，长达数月。\n- 进入这个状态后，会坚持避免使用另一个踏板，长期不踩刹车踏板，长达数月。\n这才叫完整的单踏板完全态。\n这个是我的主观评价，但并非空穴来风，在很多特斯拉车友群和论坛社区，你观察一下就知道\n几个月不踩刹车的人，大有人在，如果你提醒他注意安全，会被批判双踏板是落后的驾驶方式。\n理由是：\n- 两个踏板来回切换，更不安全。\n- 两个踏板来回切换，更不安全。\n- 两个踏板来回切换，更不安全。\n---\n最后是我个人的评价：\n没出事，都好说，出了事，一定会说：\n- 我踩的是刹车踏板，但是刹车失灵了。\n- 我踩的是刹车踏板，但是刹车失灵了。\n- 我踩的是刹车踏板，但是刹车失灵了。\n---\n以上，没有从老司机的角度去批判，全部是真实情况，给大伙做参考。",

          "description": "前几个月新入职一家公司，由于自己对业务不是很熟，而公司又有很多以前的垃圾代码，没有注释没有文档。\n直属领导 A 前几天，给我安排一个需求，需要对原来的代码进行改动。A 在其中一直在指导我怎么怎么做，在大方向上都跟我说好了，我按照他的意思写了文档，补充了一些细节（公司要求先输出技术方案，评审通过后再进行开发）。\n后来，拉会进行评审，主要是我在讲述，技术总负责人 B 全然否定了这个方案，并且较为严厉，也批评了 A 。\n事情大概就是上面这样子，我说一下我的感受。\n首先，我很不舒服，毕竟第一次做这种评审，发生这样的事情，很担心影响自己的 credit\n其次，感觉心里不平衡，因为我觉得这件事情我只是个执行者，技术方案大体框架基本都是直属领导 A 制定的，我由于对业务不熟悉，加上很多信息差，都只是照做而已。而 B 基本上是否定了所有我写技术方案的基础。很无力。\n最后，自己想法还幼稚了一下，在散会后，我和直属领导 A 讨论了 B 提出的方案之后，我随意地苦笑了一下，说自己被 B 怼，很难受。其实本意是希望 A 能平抚我的心情，结果显然是我天真了。A 没有任何其它表示，只说了句，他也被 B 怼了好几次。\n我自己也尝试思考之后怎么解决这个困境，但说实话感觉真难。\n1. 我不能说这个方案是 A 提出的，也就是不知道怎么甩锅出去\n2. 在 A 跟我提出一些方案的时候，我需要用自己的想法去质疑。但做到这点好难，我现在对业务不熟悉，在不了解全貌的情况下，很难说有自己的想法。比如，A 让我把某处代码 x 修改一下，以便于另外一处代码 y 用，我自然是去想如何修改 x 的问题，但结果 B 开会的时候直接质疑这个 x 为什么要改，y 不用这个不行吗？\n如果是各位大佬身处于我的境地，大家会怎么办，希望大家指点迷津",

          "description": "2023 年 1 月 20 号那天突发奇想：日子过得这么快，能不能写点什么记录下来，能留住一些时光，以后年纪大了也好有个回忆？于是从那一天开始写日记，到今天为止，写了 365 篇记录，大概的字数在 40 万字左右。\n初衷\n读小学的时候爸爸就要求我写日记了，初中时也写过一段时间，高中的时候在寝室里，等外面熄灯了，我躲在被子里，左手拿着手电筒和撑着被子，右手就在那写。不过都有一个共同点，都没有坚持下来，断断续续的写了一段时间就停了，等再次捡起来时已经过去了好几年。\n最近想做一个 365 计划，就从写日记开始，坚持写 365 天？一方面圆了小时候的一个愿望，做一件想做但是很久没做的事，又能实现计划的第一步。于是乎，就从这天开始了，我就开始写了。\n坚持\n有人会说从去年 1 月 20 号到今天 3 月 30 号，已经过了 14 个月 10 天，435 天，怎么你才写 365 篇呢，你不是一天写一篇吗？去年有段时间我没有写，或者哪一天太忙了我也没写。对于强迫症来说，这个是不是不完美了，日记没有坚持天天写是失败的？以前我还真是这么想的，现在我的想法是作为一个打工族，每天除了忙于工作，也有很多其他的事要处理，怎么可能坚持每天都写？但如果能尽我所能，尽量每天都写，保持总体的目标是 365 篇，而且尽可能用比较短的时间，而不是用十年，二十年去完成这个不是特别困难的目标，那为什么要计较一天两天没写呢？抱着这样的想法，直到今天终于完成了属于我的小目标。\n同时围绕着这个小目标，我尽力把每一天的事做好，平时让我写 1 万字，我都有点发怵，但是日积月累下来，没想到有这么多。我有个朋友跟我说，你这字数都可以去出书了，确实，一般的书大部分都是在 20 万，40 万左右的，我说还不行，我这废话太多了，属于废话文学。\n内容\n平均每天写了 1000 多字，有那么多写的吗？刚开始写，觉得一切很新奇，也有很多话可以对自己说，但是写一段时间就会腻或者从一开始就没什么写的。\n但我觉得，既然已经决定开始写日记了，那么最重要的是把它当成你的朋友，敞开心扉，有什么事都可以对它说，你白天的工作，你伤心的事，难过的事，开心的事，后悔的事，即将完成的事，想要去做的事，你心中的善念，或者你心中的恶，即使是流水账，都可以说出来，这样内容就会多很多。\n写日记的工具\n最开始我是用有道云笔记写的，但从去年 4 月份开始接触 obsidian 后，便逐渐所有的内容全都转到了这上面来。因为格式是通用的，markdown 形式，就算不用这个软件，也可以很轻松的换到 typora 或者其他，而像 onenote 或者有道，都是独家的格式，很麻烦。第二个是这个文件保存在本地，没有存在云上面，打开很快，而且没有隐私困扰。我自己一直放在本地或者放在我信任的云服务或者 nas 上。\n时间和地点\n最开始的时候我一直用 mac 写，有时候很忙，很难抽得出时间坐在写字桌上，就用手机写。手机最大的好处就是随时随地，方便了，我曾经在火车上写过，在等人的时候写过，在路边写过，在咖啡厅里写过，甚至在旅游途中也在写。用《那些年》的一句台词就是我就是在不停的战斗。最近我换了一下云存储，改用 onedrive 了，所以写作的主力变成了家里的台式机。大屏加上机械键盘，写起来就是更方便，更给力，缺点就是只能在家里这么用了。\n刚开始那段时间早上开始写，我通常第二天写前一天的事，有点像回忆录，优点是能够清楚的了解所有发生的事，不会发生诸如中午把日记写完，结果下午或者晚上有了更加值得的事去记录。白天和晚上都有写过，区别是白天心态更加平和，写起来更加客观，能够奋笔疾书，晚上的话人比较感性，思绪万千，容易不在状态。\n有什么用\n写那么多字或者坚持这么多天，有什么用？借用《让子弹飞》里的一句话，正经人谁写日记啊，用这么多时间还不如去打把王者。\n写这个有什么用呢？我也不知道有什么用，喜欢打游戏有什么用？能拿冠军吗？喜欢打篮球有什么用？能进 NBA 吗？大部分人都是普通人吧，应该很难达到上述的目标，但是做不到这些就不会去打游戏了吗，不会去打篮球了吗？\n人生有什么意义？我也不知道有什么意义，可能有一小部分时间属于我们自己，可以做一些自己想做的事情的时候，就很有意义了。每天打工，每天加班，并不是我们想要的生活。\n话说回来，写日记有什么用呢？我感觉最直观的用途就是如果突然提起去过哪里，我能很快通过日记找出那天，重温一下那天的记忆，有点像录像回放，最直观的功能了。",

          "description": "效率工具 RunFlow 完全手册之进阶篇\n欢迎来到 RunFlow 手册的进阶篇，如果您还不了解 RunFlow ，建议先阅读我们的基础篇。\n搜索文件\n按文件大小过滤，添加 len 参数，比如：len:1kb-2kb，len:3mb-5mb 等等。\n\n** 可以匹配多级目录，比如您想查找文件夹 folder_a 里面以 test 开头的文件，可以这样输入：folder_a/**/test。\n计算器\n我们内置了两个无理数 e 和 pi（圆周率π)。 \n\n计算超大数，如果您想计算 9999999999999999999*9999999999999999999，直接这样输入是没有结果的，我们需要在数字后面添加一个 d 参数，像这样：9999999999999999999d*9999999999999999999d。\n\n解散文件夹\n假设我们有下方示例的一个文件夹，现在我们需要删除文件夹，把所有文件提到同一级，我们就可以使用 folderunwrap。\n文件夹\n├─文本文件_01.txt\n├─文本文件_02.txt\n├─文件夹 01\n│ ├─文本文件_03.txt\n│ └─文本文件_04.txt\n└─文件夹 02\n  └─文件夹 03\n    ├─文本文件_05.txt\n    └─文本文件_06.txt\n\n解散文件夹后都在同一个目录级别：\n文本文件_01.txt\n文本文件_02.txt\n文本文件_03.txt\n文本文件_04.txt\n文本文件_05.txt\n文本文件_06.txt\n\n\n独立窗口运行\n\n导入导出数据\n我们支持导出 JSON 格式的数据，同样导入数据也需要是 JSON 格式的。\n数据同步\n本地同步服务\n基于本地的同步服务是我们内置的功能，它依赖于第三方的云盘服务，比如 OneDrive 、iCloud 、Google Drive 、小米云盘、百度云盘、阿里云盘等等。\n这里我以我常用的 OneDrive 作为示例，其他云盘的同步方法也都一样，我们可以先在 OneDrive 中新建一个 MyFlow 的文件夹用来存储需要同步的数据，然后打开 RunFlow 数据同步的设置页面，开启 基于本地的数据同步服务，并设置数据所在文件夹即可。\n\n偷偷告诉你，开启数据同步服务可以同步剪贴板。\n定时任务\n在热点事件的设置页面中，我们可以通过 Cron 表达式来设置定时任务，比如定时清理电脑垃圾回收站、定期重建文件索引等等。\n\n这里简单解释一下上面的 Cron 表达式：\n秒(0-59)\n分(0-59)\n时(0-23)\n天(1-31)\n月份(1-12)\n星期(0-7, 0 和 7 都是星期天)\n说明\n\n\n\n\n0\n0\n12\n*\n*\n*\n每天中午的 12 点执行\n\n\n0\n0\n12\n*\n*\n1\n每周一的中午 12 点执行\n\n\n\n\n了解等多 Cron 表达式，可以点击这里。\n结语\n本工具内置常见的进阶功能就介绍到这里了，如果您还想了解更多功能，可以到我们的插件商店看看，如果您是一名开发者，欢迎阅读我们的开发者篇手册，也欢迎您来提交插件。",

          "description": "2024 年，有多部值得推荐的爱情主题电影，吸引了广大观众的关注。以下是一些备受期待的爱情电影：\n《一天》(One Day)：这部电影改编自 David Nicholls 的同名畅销小说，讲述了 Emma Morley 和 Dexter Mayhew 两个人的故事。从 1988 年 7 月 15 日开始，两人的关系经历了多年的变化，这部剧情、喜剧和爱情相结合的电影，由利奥·伍德尔、安比卡·茂德、埃茜·戴维斯、蒂姆·普雷斯顿和安珀·格拉比等主演，首播日期为 2024 年 2 月 8 日。\n《可能還愛你》：由《菜鳥新移民》的納娜奇卡可汗执导，这部电影讲述了莎夏和馬可仕这对青梅竹馬的故事。他们从小到大所有人都以为他们会在一起，但他们友达以上恋人未满的感情却遲遲没有进一步发展。15 年后，当莎夏与未婚夫分手，她重新与马可仕相遇，展开了一段新的故事。\n《紫心愛戀》：这部电影讲述了樂團主唱凱西和軍人路克的故事。凯西因为糖尿病而陷入经济困境，偶然遇见同样缺钱的路克，两人决定假结婚以换取保险金。原本陌生的两颗心越走越近，但路克却得远赴伊拉克打仗，面对远距离的思念和对路克安危的担忧，凯西创作了感人至深的歌曲《 Come Back Home 》。\n《心動隔扇窗》：被称为“西班牙版格雷”的浪漫电影，讲述了女主角蕾凱兒暗恋邻居男孩很久，总是偷偷地看着他，从未与他说过话。当男孩开始回应她的感情时，两人之间的关系开始发生变化，电影中不少火辣场面，保证让情人节的夜晚更加火辣。\n这些电影不仅涵盖了从纯爱到情欲的不同类型，还展现了爱情的多样性和复杂性，无论是寻找浪漫的爱情故事，还是想要体验心动的情感冒险，Netflix 在 2024 年都为观众提供了丰富的选择。",

          "description": "近些年随着大聪明领导的增加，像咱们这些憨厚老实，任劳任怨的员工，甲状腺结节越发的普及。\n那今天就跟大家说一下，有了甲状腺结节，该怎么样买保险。\n首先在各家保险公司的重疾险赔付数据中，癌症几乎占到了 7 成以上，而甲状腺癌又占到了其中的 3 成，所以各家保险公司对甲状腺结节的核保会比较注意，下边我会针对甲状腺结节的几种情况，来说一下分别会有什么样的核保结论。\n一、有分级的情况\n首先甲状腺结节是有分级的，分为 0-6 级，级别越高恶性的概率越大。\n如果分级是 0 级，是需要进一步复查的。\n1-2 级，重疾险是有可以标体承保的产品的，也就是不用额外交保费，并且之后万一得了甲状腺癌也可以正常理赔的。\n到了 3 级，大部分重疾险都会除责承保了，也就是不会赔付甲状腺相关的重疾了，但是其他的重疾还是可以赔的。\n1-3 级的甲状腺结节，医疗险一般都是除责承保。\n到了 4 级及以上，绝大部分重疾险和医疗险都会拒保了，如果分级是 4a 的情况下，可以尝试去投保，有极个别的重疾险可以除责承保的。\n二、没有分级\n没有分级就需要针对具体情况看了，比如边缘是否清晰，是否是单发，是否有血流信号等，需要一体况一分析了。\n三、进行了手术\n如果对甲状腺结节进行了手术，术后病理是良性的，重疾险和医疗险都是有机会标体承保的。\n如果手术后病理是恶性的，就要根据情况进行核保了，一般术后最少需要半年-1 年再进行复查，结果比较理想的情况下，重疾险也是有机会除责承保的。\n关于我，一名保险经纪人。\n之前从事 10 年 QA ，目前转行保险经纪人 3 年，保险经纪人和保险代理人最大的区别就是，保险经纪人会和很多保险公司合作，市面上 90%的产品都有，会根据委托人需求再选择产品，附上 V2EX 不定期更新的保险科普帖： https://www.v2ex.com/t/981804\n同时我在全网多平台更新视频及文章，欢迎关注： 王瑞说保险 / 王瑞说保\n也帮了不少 V 友进行了保险解答或保险规划，有想了解或者需要帮助的，可以加 V：WSJianBao 备注 V2",

          "description": "大家好，我是 animalgenerator.co 的开发者，一个只了解 html+css 会一点点 javascript 的小白\n首先，我想分享一下我创建这个工具站的初衷。\n因为之前经历过 1 次裁员，为了在空余时间学点东西，或许还能赚点钱。\n我找到了一个项目想走完一套流程从开发到推广，凭我有限的编程知识，觉得这个生成随机动物图片的需求应该算比较简单吧！\n只需要做 2 个按钮，1 个点击可以随机生成，1 个可以分享就行了。\n我遇到了 2 个问题，还有想到的 2 个问题不知道怎么解决\n1 、html 的页面自己写的很难看，因为搞不懂 css 里面的 div ，后来就去 tailspark.co 上找到了一些相对好看的按钮和样式来拼凑这个 index.html 首页\n2 、javascript 写这个随机展示图片的函数，我不会写，就用 kimi.ai 告诉它我的需求，直接给我生成了随机展示 6 张图片的代码\n3 、本来图片下面有行动物名称的，还不会调样式，所以始终展示不出来，还不知道怎么解决\n4 、动物图片有 10 张，我现在是放在图片目录下面的，这样加载就会很慢，但是如果放在数据库里面，我还不知道怎么写，怎么部署后端的数据库和服务呢，更何况应该至少有 200 多张图片，如果都放在图片目录下面，应该会更慢吧\n\n虽然呈现的效果还没有达到预期，不过我也终于鼓起勇气，将我的第 1 个简陋的版本上线了——animalgenerator.co ，一个可以生成各种动物图片的网站，这些图片展示了各种动物，或许对认识生物多样性有用。\n未来的目标也是做 1 个独立开发者，感觉真是太酷啦\n我深知，作为一个个人开发者，要做出一款受欢迎的工具并不容易。在这个过程中，肯定会遇到很多很多的问题\n，但是作为小白，从 0 分到 60 分的这个过程感到非常的愉快，感觉每学会一点都有很多乐趣，也许这就是程序员编程的快乐吧！虽然我还算不上程序员\n我想通过这个帖子，向 V2EX 的各位朋友展示我的小小成果，也希望能够听到大家的意见和建议。如果你对我的网站有任何想法，或者在使用过程中遇到任何问题，都欢迎随时和我联系。\n谢谢大家的耐心阅读，期待与你们的交流！",

          "description": "各位 V 友晚上好，希望大家能够给我一些建议，非常感谢，先简单说一下我目前的情况：\n坐标：深圳，Java 开发\n事件时间线如下：\n3 月中旬：入职 A 公司，因为各种原因，不太想干了，然后去面试了下面的 B 公司\n3 月 29 号：去 B 公司面试（某珠宝公司）\n3 月 30 号：\n上午 9 点收到 B 公司 HR 电话，告知面试通过，并且添加了我的微信，把入职需要准备的资料、试用期薪资、转正薪资以聊天文字的形式发给了我，并约定好周二（ 4 月 2 号）将入职资料送到公司，周三（ 4 月 3 号）直接去上班。（我有要求 HR 以邮件的方式给我发送 offer ，她给我说的是微信发也一样）\n上午 10 点，我向原公司（ A 公司）提出辞职申请，和 HR 和上级都沟通了，发起了钉钉辞职流程。\n4 月 1 号：交接完工作，签署离职相关文件，拿到离职证明。\n4 月 2 号（今天）：去 B 公司工厂（ HR 在工厂）送入职资料，到了之后人不在，给她打电话说去展厅了，找了一个男的和我沟通，说因为 HR 最近处理的简历比较多，通知错人了，让我谅解一下（来回路费他给我报销），我顿时一脸懵逼，看不起谁呢。掰扯了好久，我说出了我的诉求，因为 B 公司的原因导致我辞去了现有的工作，我要求他们赔偿我现有公司试用期一个月的工资，对方要我提供劳动合同和辞职证明，回去后我把辞职证明和劳动合同拍照发给了联系我的 HR ，然后她回复我：法务会和我对接。下午 4 点，那个男的打电话联系我，说最多只能赔偿我深圳的基础工资（好像是 2360 元），我果断拒绝了。我最低的要求就是上家公司试用期一个月的工资，现在环境不好，一个月都不一定找得到工作。\n\n我目前想法是能私了就私了，不过目前看起来有点悬，实在不行就准备网上立案诉讼（案由是-缔约过失责任），大家觉得能行吗。",

          "description": "今天我要向你们展示如何在 Shopify 上创建你的第一个产品。\n如果你刚刚注册并且对 Shopify 完全陌生，这个教程适合你。我会一步一步引导你完成第一个产品设置。\n如果你还没有注册，你可以点击这里。\n在注册完成后，根据以下步骤:\n登录进店铺后台\n点击这里的“Product” 在左手边的侧边栏\n\n右上角点击\"Add product\"\n。\n准备\n产品图片\n产品描述\n产品视频(如果有)\n添加产品信息\n添加的是你的标题。我要卖一个手提包，所以我的标题是 CARRYALL TOTE BAG 。在创建标题时你需要注意的一点是相关的关键词。我一般使用 sumrush 来找关键字，如果你不熟悉 semrush 呢, 到时我再出一个教程，现在就按照你感觉来。\n编写描述：你在这里选择的风格完全取决于你卖的是什么，当然。但是这里有一些你肯定需要考虑的事情：首先，你的产品使用哪些材料，购买这个商品时包含什么，也许是尺寸或大小，你的产品的好处和用途是什么，它有什么优点，也许是库存和运输信息，当然，你还需要包括你的独特卖点，这就是我们在营销中称为 USB 的东西，这意味着什么使你的产品或服务比竞争对手更好。所以要确保考虑到这一点，并将其包含在你的描述中。同时，确保包括你的品牌声音，看它是否与你品牌的性格和风格一致，并且还要记住考虑任何客户在购买前可能想知道的相关信息。当然你也可以使用视频做为描述\n \n添加产品照片，一定要选择很棒的产品照片，确保它们看起来美观专业。记住，大多数人可能会根据你的照片形成第一印象。\n\n现在你需要设置价格，在设置价格时你应该考虑的一些因素。如果你完全不知道如何开始，我建议你做的第一件事可能是看看你的竞争者，看看他们的价格是多少。除此之外，你还需要考虑你的生产成本，你所销售商品的需求有多高，你的客户愿意花多少钱，诸如此类的事情。\n\n你可以看到我这里对每一个变体设置了价格，当然你可以设置一样或不一样的价格，这完全取决于你\n搜索引擎的 listing 设置定这一步非常重要，因为新客户一般会从搜索引擎找到你售卖的产品。这里你可以使用 AI 来帮助你完成\n\n如果你想立即发布这个产品，你可以在这里找到产品状态，并点击激活。如果你还不确定你是否想要这个产品立即上线，只要点击草稿，什么都不会在你的商店发表。\n\n关联 Collection 就是产品会在哪个集合中显示，这里可以多选的。\n\n最后点击 Save 保存\n那么，这就是你在 Shopify 上创建第一个产品的方法。如果你回到这里，你会看到有一个新产品可用。\n最后\n如果你对如何定制你的店铺外观感兴趣，以及如何展示你的产品，请关注我的系列文章。我会分享一系列实用技巧，帮助你首次为 Shopify 配置店铺，我期待着与你一起探索这个过程。如果你有任何疑问，请在评论区留言，我会尽力为你解答。如果你觉得这篇文章对你有所帮助，请给我点赞，这对我来说意义重大。非常感谢你的阅读，期待在下一篇文章中见到你。",

          "description": "帖子原文： https://v2ex.com/t/1027901\n看评论，大家都一边倒的在骂小孩。如果我没养过娃或者接触的少，我可能也会一边倒的批判小孩子。但经历了多了我会有不同的看法。结合自己育娃的一些经验，提供一些不同角度的看法。先说下我的结论吧：\n这个小孩子患有某种精神疾病，具体什么疾病这个涉及的比较多，我无法给出结论。我这么猜测的原因如下\n1 、帖子里说了小孩子 1 米左右，那就是在 3 岁左右，这个年龄段的小孩子其实非常胆小，基本没有敢主动攻击大人的，养过娃的应该有体会，这个年龄段的小孩子一般都怂的要死。\n2 、“大人也没有向我道歉，还一直跟小孩说幸好我脾气好，不然 blabla 的”，这句话潜在含义这不是小孩子第一次这么做了，之前应该被其他人还批评教训过。但同时另一位大人让他道歉，只是不听。说明这家人不是那种完全不讲理的，只不过可能经历得多了，处理得并不好。\n3 、原文有这么一句话“但这小孩根本不听，依然对我怒目而视”，这是我特别深有感触的一点。因为我接触过几乎和这一模一样的小孩子。差不多也是这个年纪，我的娃第一次和他玩，玩着玩着的过程中，突然要打我娃，眼睛瞪得特别吓人，把我娃也吓到了。当时我也很愤怒，好在旁边有人，制止了他进一步的行为。后续才知道，这个小孩子有精神类疾病（大多数时候没问题，但如果遇到什么情况就会大人），小孩一家也很可怜，妈妈只能辞去工作，去学校陪读。了解到这个背景后，我也没那么气了，因为小孩子很多疾病真的没办法，哪家撞上都是倒大霉。\n这里只是结合自己的经历，提供一些自己的看法，我个人非常痛恨那些熊孩子，特别是最近的热点话题，恨的直痒痒。只不过因为这个帖子比较特殊，娃实在是很小（三岁左右，如果是六岁以上我可能就不会这么结论了），我并不认为他是真的很坏那种，刚好自己也有类似的经历，所以拿出来和大家分享。无意给那小孩洗地。\n不过这个家长确实做的有不到位的情况，这时候应该主动和对方道歉（甚至在肢体动作上，给对方暗示下小孩子有问题)。养娃的也可以分享下自己的看法。",

          "description": "我的博客原文： https://blog.licsber.site/2024/03/29/人月神话的困境/\n很多“聪明人”的思维都是线性思维，拿到任务，分解成小项，逐个完成，一步一步的像是在做证明题：期待着攒够一个又一个的事实和推理，最后拼图一般将它们串起来，达成某项任务。逻辑层面上看起来无懈可击，仿佛一切困难都可迎刃而解。\n不可否认的是这套思维在应试方面屡试不爽，因为有一个天然的假设是存在的：“所有问题都有标准答案，问题在设计上就是逻辑可解的”。但是习惯这套“逻辑“的人，在处理现实世界的问题时，往往会不自觉地将自己带入死胡同。\n我将这个方法论称之为逻辑关联，与之相对的即是事实关联，生活中不乏遇到这种思维陷阱：\n白菜 3 块钱一斤，15 块钱可以买五斤白菜\n你们工厂一个月可以生产 3000 个零件，那明天先给我 10 个吧\n这个项目比较急，上次排期的工时是一周，我再给你一倍的人，三天给我做出来\n有时候其实很难意识到这样的思考模式存在的问题，这也是《人月神话》里屡次提到的困境，可能上面的例子不太直观，代入下现实生活：\n生一个孩子需要 9 个月，生一对双胞胎需要 18 个月\n生一个孩子需要 9 个月，9 个妈妈是不是只要 1 个月？！\n专注解决问题的思维方式久了，就会慢慢开始只在乎逻辑关联，而忽略事实关联，就会开始期待一种“银弹”，说是缘木求鱼也不过如此。\n很多初级项目经理最常犯的错误就在这里，总是期待着任何事情都有一个进度条，这样就可以直观的反馈当前进展，自己要做的也就不过是按照排期表往下催进度。\n这种人最喜欢问的问题就是“你这个要多久才能做出来？”，行使着身为“管理者”的特权，却不承担应有的角色义务。\n项目经理这个角色，真正应该问的问题是“你还需要哪些其他的帮助可以提升你的速度？”。优秀的项目经理知道，项目进度不是靠完成了多少来判断，而是靠如何拥有足够的资源进行最大规模的试错。项目经理确保的应该是满足需求，成功交付，然而现实中 X-Y 本末倒置的现象非常普遍，即为了完成某个目标，制定了一些 KPI （关键绩效指标），最后完全忽视了原初的目标，而去追求后定的 KPI 。就像是前段时间北京环卫工人买新鲜白菜当厨余垃圾事件，政策目标是垃圾分类，管理者制定了每种垃圾必须的数量指标，然后只考察这个数量指标，下面执行的人就变了味，偏离初衷，最终酿成悲剧。\n再者，项目经理在向上汇报进度的同时，也在享受作为一个管理者的荣誉，以及成功后收割胜利果实。这使得执行层面的人本身就对这些只能汇报进度，却无法承担执行工作的人非常敌视。\n况且在软件开发这个对人依赖非常大的领域，管理起来更需要一定的水平积累。项目经理每天跟人打交道，要知道人是有感情的，绝对不是你给他输入 1+1 ，他就给你输出 2 。同一个功能点同一个人，由于其工作状态的差别，也会产生巨大的差异，如果主动积极做，可能只要 1 天，消极怠工的做，就无法预期了。这在传统行业是无法想象的，因为只要按规定的程序和规范来做，即使换一拨工人，也可以在同样的时间建造出来，建出来的房子的质量也不会相差太远。要知道，再烂的挖土机也能挖出一个大坑。\n执行时，对软件工程师来说，遇到问题，解决问题。但如果遇到的问题占用了比预期更多的时间，则是对自己能力和自信的打击。此时如果项目经理也不专业，硬推进度，工程师就会出现一些掩盖问题的行为。\n我总觉得，负责技术攻坚的人也去追进度就很可惜。悲剧的根源是管理能力和技巧的不足，如果真的想做到结果导向，需要的是目标的制定和拆解，工作计划的精确评估和执行，真实有效的复盘，信息同步与应对突发状况的能力，这些都对领导者有很高的要求，如果能力不足以管理结果，那大家就只能来管理过程，最终陷入恶性循环。\n参考\n工程师想要做管理？先改变你的思考方式\n从程序员到项目经理：为什么要当项目经理",

          "description": "简版：电梯里一小孩误以为我挡住了电梯门，然后就被小孩无脑打了几下且力度不小。\n地铁到站后看到等垂梯的人比较少，于是就准备坐垂梯出站。\n一向不太喜欢跟人挤，所以排最后一个进。进去后站好，门要关的时候又突然开了。\n观察了一下，确认自己并没有挡门，于是撇了眼电梯按钮方向，像是有个小孩在按，以为是按错了就没有在意。\n但是门在第二次关的时候又开了，还伴随着滴滴声。正想要仔细看看是不是真按错了按钮时，突然感觉腰部受到重击，回头一看是那个小孩在打我。\n目测这个小孩身高 1 米左右，举着双手打到我腰部和靠上一点的位置，不是很痛，但是明显感觉力道不小。\n打了几下之后被他家大人拉开了，后面还听到他家其中大人(妈妈？)在跟他解释是自己不小心靠着碰到按钮了。后面又听到另一个大人(爸爸？)用比较严厉的口吻跟他说，就是你(指小孩)自己按的！\n然后就是另一位大人(奶奶？)让他跟我道歉，但这小孩根本不听，依然对我怒目而视，我相信如果不是被拉着，他肯定还要接着打我。\n大人也没有向我道歉，还一直跟小孩说幸好我脾气好，不然 blabla 的。\n第一次遇到这种事还是有点懵逼的，完全不知道该怎么办，电梯上去的过程中还是非常想还下手，但是好几个大人在肯定也不现实，而且也想到什么只要还手就是互殴，到时候整个跟小孩互殴，会不会是我责任更大？最后非常木讷地上去之后正常出站回家了。\n走在回家的路上越想越气，就想着至少也应该报个警帮他们管教一下，但是又一想，这么点事到时会不会被说浪费警力啥的。\n目前还是被打的地方还是有点不适感的，像是那种腰累的感觉。\n仅吐槽，无法感同身受请勿恶语伤害。",

          "description": "先说情况（个人主观叙述）：骑自行车在一个路口右转，该路段仅有一条约 1.5 米宽的人行道（上有盲道、公交车站等设施，顶上有施工的脚架），我在机动车道最右侧行驶，被交警截停，以违反《中华人民共和国道路交通安全法》第五十七条规定为由，根据《中华人民共和国道路交通安全法》和《广东省道路交通安全条例》作出警告处罚。执法过程中我向执勤交警指出，在没有划定非机动车道的情况下，非机动车可以在机动车道最右侧行驶。执勤交警说在全国范围内，人行道均可以兼当非机动车道。当时赶着骑行，也不想为难交警（因为没罚款），就签名拿了罚单。\n回来之后越想越不对，查阅了相关条款，罗列如下：\n《中华人民共和国道路交通安全法》第三十六条：根据道路条件和通行需要，道路划分为机动车道、非机动车道和人行道的，机动车、非机动车、行人实行分道通行。没有划分机动车道、非机动车道和人行道的，机动车在道路中间通行，非机动车和行人在道路两侧通行。\n《中华人民共和国道路交通安全法》第五十七条：驾驶非机动车在道路上行驶应当遵守有关交通安全的规定。非机动车应当在非机动车道内行驶；在没有非机动车道的道路上，应当靠车行道的右侧行驶。\n《中华人民共和国道路交通安全法实施条例》第七十条：因非机动车道被占用无法在本车道内行驶的非机动车，可以在受阻的路段借用相邻的机动车道行驶，并在驶过被占用路段后迅速驶回非机动车道。机动车遇此情况应当减速让行。\n我觉得主要争议点如下：\n“非机动车未在非机动车道内行驶”：他的表述看起来没有问题，确实没在非机动车道行驶。但现场并无非机动车道，按规定可以在车行道右侧行驶，应该不适用于这条。\n“人行道可以兼当非机动车道”：同样按照《中华人民共和国道路交通安全法》第五十七条，非机动车也不应该在人行道行驶，交警这句话本身就是错的。另外，如果要按照这条执法，非机动车在机动车道行驶可能违法，在人行道行驶也可能违法，非机动车到底怎么开？\n另，这种情况是否可以向交警提起异议，撤销处罚？",

          "description": "2024 ，第 12 周，0318-0324\n如释重负的一周，放松了很多。\n\n极简日记 iOS\n这周终于提交了一个 TF ，主要是围绕导出导出功能做优化：\n修复了导出闪退\n导出时可以看到图片总数\n点击数据文件可以直接打开 App 进行导入\n直接将导出的数据文件直接放到 App 的文件夹内，并可以一键打开文件夹\n内存释放问题\n从上周开始，我就一直在处理导出数据时爆内存的问题。数据比较少的时候还好，但是数据一多，特别是图片内容比较多的情况下，导出时必然会出现因为内存不足而闪退。\n经过逐项方法的排查，最终确定问题就出现在读取图片数据上。我尝试了各种方法，减少 fetch limit ，加 autoreleasepool ，每次循环结束后清空数组，都不行。而且奇怪的是，即使退出导出页面了，被占用的内存也没有释放。\n后来在请教了肘子哥之后，肘子哥立刻看出了问题所在，一针见血，一句代码就解决了我的问题。原来我之前使用的是全局的 Environment 托管上下文，改成临时的上下文就 ok 了。\n这不是第一次肘子哥帮我解决 Core Data 方面的问题了，在此，赞美肘子哥！\nDebug view\n为了让用户帮我调试 App ，我写了个在非生产环境下才会出现的 debug view 。 正好 RevenueCat 也有一个 debug UI ，可以显示关于内购的相关信息，就也加进来了。Debug mode 下没有任何问题，但是 Release Mode 就无法编译，archive 也不行，找了半天原因，直到看到 RevenueCat 的文档里有这么一句：\nNote: The debug UI won't compile for release builds, so you'll need to disable the behavior before archiving for release.\n旁路由\n买了大电视后，就特别想在电视上看 Netflix 。\n最简单的方案应该是 Apple TV ，但是没舍得。前些天差点就买了一个软路由，但是看看价格还是舍不得。之前用 NAS 折腾过一次旁路由，失败了。又看了几个教程后发现我的 NAS 完全可以做旁路由，之前失败其实是搞错了方向。\n周日花了一下午和一晚上终于搞定了 Nas+OpenWrt 。期间遇到了 OpenWrt 可以联网，但是连到 openwrt 的手机无法联网的问题。装了两个不同版本的 openwrt 的镜像，各种瞎鼓捣，又是 opkg ，又是配置接口和防火墙，还特意花钱注册了一个论坛账号。\n搞定后发现，将电视的 IP 和 DNS 设置成旁路由还是比较麻烦，还不如直接用电脑或者手机投屏了……不过 OpenWrt 还是有很多可玩性的，有待以后慢慢探索了。\n认真减肥第三周\n本周体重变化不大，但是有新突破，突破了 190 斤，最低 189.7 斤。\n有两天的晚饭吃得比较晚，因为特别饿吃得还比较多，万幸没有涨称。\n健身+游泳\n这周只去了两次健身房，周二练背，周五练胸。\n泳池终于重新开放了，去年买的游泳三件套终于开封了，去游了 30 分钟。\n不服不行，年龄越大，身体恢复就越慢，健身后三天酸痛都没有丝毫减轻。\n杂事\n周五的时候清空了 Boss 给的任务列表，度过了一个轻松无压力的周末\n买了个 69.8 的联想夹耳式耳机，真是一分钱一分货啊，包装和做工都非常差，到手后试听了 1 小时果断退货了\n花了一下午折腾在本地用 act 执行 GitHub action ，失败\n继续上周的 SwiftData 学习，这周看完了 Stewart Lynch 的这个系列视频\n看完了网飞版的《三体》，没想到我的时间线上对这个剧评价的两极分化如此严重。我看过原著，也看过腾讯版，我个人倒是觉得网飞版还不错，可以打四星\n采用一种新的番茄工作法，写 25 分钟代码，玩一局 Brotato 😜",

          "description": "为什么能不还呢？靠脸皮厚死撑？靠法律在我一边？\n当然不是！更不是熬到 P2P 公司暴雷跑路。在这样一个风口上，在资本大量涌向 P2P 行业的时候，在这样一片前景大好的时候，要作出行业暴雷的判断，要么这个人是绝顶的商业天才，要么他就是这次风口的幕后操盘手。我这位同事，自然是跟这些毫不沾边的。\n主要的原因在于：当时的平台，全都没有活体（人脸）验证技术！\n只要有一个正常的手机（含卡）、一张身份证、一张银行卡，就能走到提交借款申请的流程。那么，如果我用的所有东西都是鲁迅的，你怎么找到我？你找鲁迅跟我有什么关系？\n所以说，人脸识别，在证件链中是一项革命性的技术，它让信息安全在领域里有了质的飞跃。现下的我们回过头去看，发现过去的平台漏洞很大，那是因为技术更迭太快了，我们这种回看，属于站在巨人肩膀上进行俯视。但是，在人脸识别仅存在于大厂开发和内测阶段、并未正式面世的当时，绝大多数人从惯性思维出发，并没觉得这个借款流程或环节有什么不对。\n当然，平台明白用户的证件链是有缺陷的，所以，除了身份证信息这种常规审核外，结合现有技术，平台通常有以下潜在的机制和审核：\n1 、用户注册登录时，需要授权程序读通讯录名单、读相册图片、读通话记录、读摄像头等功能，以便后期给催收提供素材。拒绝权限的设备将无法正常使用 APP ；\n2 、用户手机的通讯录、相册里的数据不能太少，否则人工审核不会通过；\n3 、用户需要填写一名紧急联系人（或称“担保人”）信息，由平台人员电话核实确有其人。\n平台做的这一切，都是为了确保手机前的借款人与其提交的身份信息上的人，是同一个人。\n本来，这些潜在的审核规则，普通用户是不容易发现的，但该同事依靠着特殊的知识获取途径——产品评审会，如卧底般迅速拆解了这些设定，还恰恰有路子把规则避开！虽然期间经历了一点小小的不爽，比如，他与法律同事俩人确定要干这件事后，就联系之前那个卖“套件”的人，想再买一套身份信息，对方开口就是 2000 。他说，上回 1200 呀，咋涨这么多，而且我不需要 U 盾。对方一副爱买不买的态度，说，现在就这个价。双方因此不欢而散。\n我同事又去找其他路子，但忙活了几天，也没发现有卖得比那个人便宜的。他不得不放低姿势，再去找那哥们买货，结果，人家报价 2400 了！他气得要砸键盘。一旁看着的法律同事倒是非常淡定，笑了笑，说：算了，这就是风口嘛，只要东西能用就行，买，买两套，要快。\n于是，加上之前买的那套身份信息，他，以及和他搭档的律师老乡，在网络世界上，有了 3 个影子。",

          "description": "日前有消息显示，谷歌DeepMind方面发布的Mixture-of-Depths（MoD），改变了以往Transformer架构的计算模式。\n\r\n\r\n据了解，通过动态分配大模型中的FLOPs（运算次数或计算资源），优化不同层次模型深度中的分配，限制给定层的自注意力和MLP计算的token数量，MoD可跳过一些不必要计算，迫使神经网络学会主要关注真正重要的信息， 实现只给需要准确预测的token分配更多计算资源，从而显著提高训练效率和推理速度。\n\r\n\r\n例如，虽然预测下一个句子的内容很难，但预测句子结束的标点符号很简单，如果给两者分配同样的计算资源，那么后者明显会浪费资源、而MoD则可避免这种情况。\n\r\n\r\n据谷歌方面发布的相关测试结果显示，在等效计算量和训练时间上，MoD每次向前传播所需的计算量更小，而且后训练采样过程中步进速度提高50%。\n\r\n\r\n据了解，谷歌研究团队还探讨了MoD和MoE结合的可能性MoDE，而且结果表明而这一结合能提供更好的性能和更快的推理速度。\n\r\n\r\n此外值得一提的是，为解决AI幻觉问题，不久前谷歌DeepMind还与斯坦福大学联合开了一款AI事实核查工具“搜索增强事实评估器”（Search-Augmented Factuality Evaluator，SAFE）。\n\r\n\r\n据了解，SAFE可通过四个步骤对AI聊天机器人生成的回复进行分析、处理和评估，以验证其准确性和真实性。具体而言，SAFE首先会将回复分割成多个单个待核查内容、对上述内容进行修正，然后再与谷歌搜索结果进行比较。随后，SAFE还会检查各个事实与原始问题的相关性。\n\r\n\r\n为评估SAFE性能，谷歌方面的研究人员还创建了包含约16000个事实的数据集LongFact，并在包括Claude、Gemini、GPT、PaLM-2在内的13个大语言模型上测试了这一工具。结果显示，在对100个有争议事实进行的重点分析中，SAFE的判定在进一步审查下正确率达到76% 。与此同时，SAFE还具备显著的经济性优势，即其成本比人工注释便宜20多倍。\n\r\n\r\n稿源：新浪网",

          "description": "当地时间周一(4月1日)，人工智能(AI)公司OpenAI宣布，将允许用户直接使用ChatGPT，而无需注册该项服务，这将让人们更加容易体验人工智能的潜力。\n\r\n\r\nOpenAI表示，它将从周一开始逐步推出这一功能，让185个国家和地区的超1亿用户使用ChatGPT来学习新事物、寻找创意灵感，并获得问题的答案。2022年底，OpenAI正式发布了人工智能聊天机器人ChatGPT，随后在全世界掀起了人工智能狂潮，它可以模仿人类对话，并执行诸如创建长文本摘要、写诗甚至为主题派对生成创意等任务。\n\r\n\r\n据数据分析公司Similarweb称，自2023年5月ChatGPT全球总访问量达到18亿次的峰值以来，这一受欢迎服务的流量增长开始放缓。\n\r\n\r\n这应该也是OpenAI放开限制的原因，随着人工智能技术的发展，现有的互联网信息量可能不足以支撑科技巨头训练更先进的人工智能系统，甚至高质量文本数据的不足可能减缓人工智能技术的发展速度。\n\r\n\r\nOpenAI还表示，它已为无需注册即可访问ChatGPT的用户引入了额外的内容保护措施，例如阻止更广泛范围的类别中的提示和生成。但并未具体说明这些类别。\n\r\n\r\n除了ChatGPT的免费版本(即ChatGPT3.5)，OpenAI还将继续为个人、团队用户和企业提供付费版本。\n\r\n\r\n该公司还声称，它可能会使用用户提供的内容来帮助改进其大语言模型，但用户可以关闭此功能。\n\r\n\r\n虽然之后用户无需注册即可使用ChatGPT，不过，OpenAI还是建议用户注册一个账户。因为创建帐户有很多好处，包括保存和查看聊天记录、共享聊天记录，以及解锁语音对话和自定义说明等附加功能。\n\r\n\r\n与此同时，OpenAI推出了一种新的人工智能工具Voice Engine，通过输入文本和15秒音频样本，Voice Engine便可以生成一个与音频中说话者非常相似的自然语音，而生成的自然语音具有丰富的情感和逼真的声音。\n\r\n\r\n近日，据证券时报援引科技媒体The Information消息，微软和OpenAI正在规划建设一个雄心勃勃的数据中心项目，该项目可能耗资高达1000亿美元，折合人民币约7200亿元。其中包括一台名为“星际门”的人工智能超级计算机，该计算机将配备数百万个专用服务器芯片，旨在为OpenAI的AI技术提供强大动力。\n\r\n\r\n据悉，上述数据中心项目的成本，是目前一些最大数据中心项目的100倍，微软将承担项目的资金投入，展现了其对推动AI技术发展的坚定信心。整个数据中心项目分为五个阶段，目前正处于第三阶段，后两个阶段的重要节点分别为2026年和2028年。\n\r\n\r\n在微软和OpenAI的算力开发第四、第五阶段，都会有一台标志性的超算。其中第四阶段的超级计算机预期将在2026年投入使用，而第五阶段的超级计算机已经有了一个酷炫的代号——星际门（Stargate），微软高层希望最快能够在2028年推出这款超算。这也将是微软未来六年规划建设的一系列超算中规格最高的一个。\n\r\n\r\n另外，据媒体报道，OpenAI的“下一次重大更新”会在明年初推出。在今年初比尔·盖茨对话奥尔特曼的节目中，OpenAI首席执行官明确表示GPT-5的开发正在进行中。此前也有报道称，GPT-5的发布时间会是今年年中，同时OpenAI已经向一些企业用户提供了早期版本的预览。\n\r\n\r\n来源：每日经济新闻综合OpenAI、证券时报",

          "description": "近日，成都市新都区的一份初三语文试卷引发了社会广泛关注。该试卷中出现了一篇被指涉嫌美化侵华日军和侮辱八路军的文章——《杜鹃花落》。3月25日晚，成都市新都区通报称新都区已成立联合调查组进行全面调查，对相关教研员及区教科院院长予以停职。3月26日，河南省安阳市汤阴县教育局发布通告回应，该文作者已被免职。\n\r\n\r\n有资料称，李佳前是河南汤阴县的一所中学的校长，《杜鹃花落》这篇文章是于去年撰写并发表在网上的。这篇小小说以侵华日军的视角展开，主角岗田大佐是侵华日军的一份子，他的儿子本是日本帝国大学高材生，为了看望父亲来到中国，但在赶赴和父亲团聚的途中被八路军劫走，岗田为报仇而率军扫荡，把一股八路军尽数屠戮之后才发现，八路军一直在尽全力保护自己儿子，反而是自己的报复杀死了儿子。\n\r\n\r\n3月26日深夜，胡锡进在微博平台上发表了一篇近千字的长文，这篇文章针对“成都‘毒试卷’”事件发表了他个人的看法。\n\r\n\r\n胡锡进首先表示：他认可网友们对《杜鹃花落》这篇文章以及“成都‘毒试卷’”事件的愤怒，他觉得“这种愤怒是朴素的，（是）有道理的”，“即使（《杜鹃花落》的）作者有探索新写法的用意，（但）他的这种写法也无法被普通读者（所）理解，因而，（会令众多读者感到不舒服）。”他觉得，他无法确定这名作者的真实用意，很难相信那些初三学生能够理解那些意涵。\n\r\n\r\n接下来，胡锡进认为：无论是对那名已被免职校长（指《杜鹃花落》的作者李佳前）的调查以及对“毒试卷”的调查，都要坚持客观性，要听涉事人员的陈述，在当前的社会环境下，《杜鹃花落》的作者李佳前是不会故意去挑衅社会强大的共识的，是不会拿鸡蛋往石头上撞的。基于此，应该允许《杜鹃花落》的作者李佳前以及“成都‘毒试卷’”的当事人进行申辩。\n\r\n\r\n再接下来，胡锡进认为：小说《杜鹃花落》里面的基本情节不但没有侮辱八路军，而且，还有意突出了八路军的英勇，多数人是被…",

          "description": "使用 GitHub Discussions 写作文章大半年以来，越来越得心应手，最近起用了新的一个仓库，用于 Knowledge-Garden 静态资源的保存和使用。\n文章\n所有的文章都是以 markdown 的格式进行保存，实际上就一堆 text 文本，占用不了多少的空间。\n静态资源\n文章的静态资源，主要是图片，才是一个最耗流量和存储空间的东西。\n前一段时间经历了腾讯云 cos 对象存储被盗刷 的事件后，对于对象存储的使用也就越来越谨慎，今天终于狠下决心来把 Knowledge-Garden 这个仓库的所有包括图片在内的静态资源开始保存到另外一个 GitHub 仓库 PicKG，同时借助 Cloudflare Pages 来为图片提供访问链接。\n也尝试了一下 Cloudflare 的 R2 这个号称零出口费用的对象存储，免费额度很有吸引力，但目前 Cloudflare R2 还没能找到一个比较顺手的图片管理工具，例如阿里云的 oss-browser、腾讯云的 cos-browser。虽然尝试了一些折中的方案，如 Picx4R2，但还是不太满意。\n所以目前的解决方法就是 GitHub + PicX + Cloudflare Pages 进行组合，GitHub 单个仓库 5G 的存储空间应该应该也足够使用了，如果实在不够了再来考虑其他方案。",

          "description": "由于 PicX 自 v3.0 起，不再支持自由选择仓库和分支，统一使用内置的仓库和分支。所以出于自定义的仓库和分支使用需求，这里主要对 PicX v2.0 进行 Vercel 自定义部署。\n项目地址：https://github.com/XPoet/picx/tree/v2\n利用 PicX 图床，直接把图片托管到 GitHub 上去。至于安装，参考子舒 Blog的《安装一个基于 Github 的静态图床程序》这两篇文章。可以把程序和图床直接托管在 GitHub 上，也可以把程序搭建在自己的服务器上，但是图片还是只能托管到 GitHub 上。PicX 图床不像简单图床和兰空图床，图片生成的链接可以是自己的域名链接，而因为图片是托管到 GitHub 上，所以 PicX 生成的图片外链接只能是 staticaly 和 cloudfalre 的 CDN 的外链。所以个人感觉也就没有必要再把程序上传到自己的服务器上了，直接使用 GitHub 不是更好嘛。\n操作步骤\n主要的操作步骤如下：\n1 个 GitHub 账号；\n1 个 Vercel 账号，可能需要科学上网环境；\nFork PicX v2 源码 (https://github.com/XPoet/picx/tree/v2) 到个人 GitHub 仓库；\n在 Vercel 新建项目，绑定个人 GitHub 仓库的 PicX v2 源码；Framework Preset 选择 \"Vue.js\"；\n部署完成后为域名添加一条 CNAME 到 cname-china.vercel-dns.com。",
