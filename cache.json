          "description": "I used to work at Adobe on the infrastructure powering big applications like Photoshop and  Acrobat. One of our worst headaches was making these really powerful codebases work on desktop, web, mobile, and the cloud without having to completely rewrite them.  For example, to get Lightroom and Photoshop working on the web we took a winding path through JavaScript, Google’s PNaCl, asm.js, and finally WebAssembly, all while having to rethink our GPU architecture around these devices. We even had to get single-threaded builds working and rebuild the UI around Web Components. Today the web builds work great, but it was a decade-long journey to get there!\nThe graphics stack continues to be one of the biggest bottlenecks in portability. One day I realized that WebAssembly (Wasm) actually held the …",

We’re code-first because we think engineers prefer being in their IDE (especially today, with all the advancements in dev-tools) when building out internal tooling for their company.\nHere’s a demo of writing code and then deploying your tools:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDTk1SmtpXw\nAnd here’s one on how to get started with the CLI: \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JyyyRv2TJy0.\nA lot of internal tool builders (eg: Retool and Tooljet) are low-code, meaning you’re given a WYSIWYG drag-and-drop UI where you can drag components onto a canvas, and then wire them up to a data source or endpoint using a form/code-block.

          "description": "Truncate is a chess flavoured word game that blends spatial reasoning and wordplay. In puzzle mode, you beat back your NPC opponent's words and take over their territory.\nTruncate started as a pen and paper game between a friend and I, evolved into a handmade board game, and finally arrived at an online puzzle game. Like any good word game, there is of course a daily mode, shareable with the tried and true grid of emojis\nWe've been playtesting it with friends and family for a few months, which has helped iron out the tutorials and gameplay, and we're finally happy with an MVP worth sharing!\nTechnical deets: The client and server are written in Rust, with the visuals built using egui (as an experiment in Rust's GUI ecosystem).\nWe'd love any feedback!\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39882873\nPoints: 126\n# Comments: 82",

Here’s a video demo: https://youtu.be/yLCIo3jG2GM, and you can try it now at https://app.sandbox.thorntale.com without signing in.\nWhy? Because one of us (the data scientist) kept asking the other (a backend engineer) to move metrics from ClickHouse and CockroachDB, to Snowflake, to Looker, and then to Excel, so that she could make a chart in Excel for the BizOps team to screenshot, and finally stick in Google Slides.

          "description": "Hi HN, We're Luke and Phillip, and we're building Spice.ai OSS - a lightweight, portable runtime, built in Rust and powered by Apache DataFusion to locally materialize, accelerate, and query data tables sourced from any database, data warehouse or data lake.\nPhillip and I first introduced Spice on Show HN in September 2021. Since then, we’ve been schooled and humbled in every way building 100TB+ data and ML systems for the https://spice.ai cloud platform. Along with our customers, we struggled with getting fast, low-latency, high-concurrency SQL query within a budget, accessing and combining data from many sources, trade-offs between OLTP/OLAP compute engines, and managing datasets as code.\nToday, we’re re-launching Spice, completely rebuilt from the ground up, to directly solve several of the problems we had in accessing data quickly and cost-effectively  providing it to applications, dashboards, and machine learning. Spice provides federated SQL query across databases (MySQL, PostgreSQL, etc.), data warehouses (Snowflake, BigQuery, etc.) and data lakes (S3, MinIO, Databricks, etc.) with the ability to materialize remote datasets locally using in-memory Arrow, DuckDB, SQLite, or PostgreSQL. Accelerated engines run in your infrastructure giving you flexibility and control over price and performance.\nYou can read the full announcement blog post at https://blog.spiceai.org/posts/2024/03/28/adding-spice-the-n....\nWe’d appreciate it if you check Spice out, give us feedback, and if you'd like to contribute, we'd love to build with you.\nThanks!\nGitHub: https://github.com/spiceai/spiceai\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39854584\nPoints: 84\n# Comments: 20",

A trader organizes a shipment of it to a receiver near you, who then manufactures and distributes it to your local supermarket or coffee shop.\nThat sounds simple enough, but any shipment involving commodities involves around 200 processes, at least 50 documents, and extensive coordination through emails and phone calls.

Tracecat automates the tasks a security analyst has to do when responding to a security alert: e.g. contact victims, investigate security logs, report vulnerability.\nThe average security analyst deals with 100 alerts per day. As soon as an alert comes in, you have to investigate and respond. An average alert takes ~30 minutes to analyze (and 100 x 30 min = 50 hours > one whole day) Lots of things get dropped, and this creates vulnerabilities. Many breaches can be traced back to week old alerts that didn’t get properly investigated.\nSince the risks and costs are so high, top security teams currently pay Splunk SOAR $100,000/year to help automate alert processing.

          "description": "Hey HN! We've developed OpenAPI AutoSpec, a tool for automatically generating OpenAPI specifications from localhost network traffic. It’s designed to simplify the creation of API documentation by just using your website or service, especially useful when you're pressed for time.\nDocumenting endpoints one by one sucks. This project originated from us needing it at our past jobs when building 3rd-party integrations.\nIt acts as a local server proxy that listens to your application’s HTTP traffic and automatically translates this into OpenAPI 3.0 specs, documenting endpoints, requests, and responses without much effort.\nInstallation is straightforward with NPM, and starting the server only requires a few command-line arguments to specify how and where you want your documentation generated ex. npx autospec --portTo PORT --portFrom PORT --filePath openapi.json\nIt's designed to work with any local website or application setup without extensive setup or interference with your existing code, making it flexible for different frameworks. We tried capturing network traffic on Chrome extension and it didn't help us catch the full picture of backend and frontend interactions.\nWe aim in future updates to introduce features like HTTPS and OpenAPI 3.1 specification support.\nFor more details and to get started, visit our GitHub page (https://github.com/Adawg4/openapi-autospec). We also have a Discord community (https://discord.com/invite/CRnxg7uduH) for support and discussions around using OpenAPI AutoSpec effectively.\nWe're excited to hear what you all think!\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39817850\nPoints: 86\n# Comments: 25",

          "description": "Hi HN! We're Edward and Sam, the founders of DryMerge (https://drymerge.com), a tool to automate workflows with plain English. For example, a user can say \"When I get an email from a potential customer, add their details to a google sheet and send me a text\", and DryMerge sets that up end-to-end in seconds. Other examples might be “When I finish a Google Meet with a customer, record any issues reported in Linear”, or “Every morning at 9 am, text me a summary of my calendar events for the day”.\nHere’s a video walkthrough: https://youtu.be/S4L3B21vXGY.\nWe initially set out to build a dev tool for API integration, and while building in the integration space, we realized existing workflow automation tools have a few key limitations.

          "description": "Hi HN! We’re Adrien and Kanav. We met at our previous job, where we spent about a third of our lives combating a constant firehose of bugs. In the hope of reducing this pain for others in the future, we’re working on automating debugging.\nWe’re currently working on a platform that ingests logs and then automatically reproduces, root causes and ultimately fixes production bugs as they happen. You can see some of our work on this here - https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39528087\nAs we were building the root-cause phase of our automated debugger, we realized that we developed something that resembled an omniscient debugger. Like an omniscient debugger, it also keeps track of variable assignments over time but, you can interact with it at a higher level than a debugger using natural language. We ended up sticking it in a pytest plugin and have been using it ourselves for development over the past few weeks.\nUsing this pytest plugin, you’re able to reason at a much higher level than conventional debuggers and can ask questions like:\n- Why did function x get hit?\n- Why was variable y set to this value?\n- What changes can I make to this code to make this test pass?\nHere’s a brief demo of this in action: https://www.loom.com/share/94ebe34097a343c39876d7109f2a1428\nTo achieve this, we first instrument the test using sys.settrace (or, on versions of python >3.12, the far better sys.monitoring!) to keep a history of all the functions that were called, along with the calling line numbers. We then re-run the test and use AST parsing to find all the variable assignments and keep track of those changes over time. We also use AST parsing to obtain the source code for these functions. We then neatly format and pass all this context to GPT.\nWe’d love it if you checked the pytest plugin out and we welcome all feedback :) . If you want to chat bugs, our emails are also always open - kanav@leaping.io\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39791301\nPoints: 75\n# Comments: 14",

We provide generative AI tools for musicians, including text-to-sound and infinite sample packs.\nWe (Mark and Justin) started writing music together a few years ago but felt limited in our ability to create anything that we were proud of. Modern music production is highly technical and requires knowledge of sound design, tracking, arrangement, mixing, mastering, and digital signal processing. Even with our technical backgrounds (in AI and cloud computing respectively), we struggled to learn what we needed to know.\nThe emergence of latent diffusion models was a turning point for us just like many others in tech. All of a sudden it was possible to leverage AI to create beautiful art. After meeting our cofounder…",

          "description": "Hey HN, we've built DaLMatian, a text2sql product that meets the needs of data analysts working with enterprise data. We built this app because as a data analyst at an enterprise I could not find a text2sql product that was (1) actually useful for my day-to-day and (2) easy to set up on my computer. Existing products either fall apart when tested on gnarly enterprise data/queries or require going through a sales/integration process that I wasn't in a position to push for - I just wanted something that I could quickly set up to help make my job easier. Our goal is to make this a reality for any data analyst that feels the same.\nThere are many constraints that make this reality difficult to achieve. The product needs to scale to databases with millions of columns and extract business logic from very complex queries. It also needs to be fast, at least faster than an analyst would take to write the query. On top of all this, an analyst needs to be allowed to use it from a security standpoint. Our app meets all the key requirements of an enterprise data analyst while also being lightweight enough to run locally on a typical laptop.\nHere's how it works. To get started, you simply need to open a file of past queries in our IDE (try it here: https://www.dalmatian.ai/download) and add a file with your database schema (instructions here: https://www.dalmatian.ai/docs#configuration). There is also an option to connect a database to auto pull your schema (no actual data is seen by the LLM). We do not see anything you input since the app is local and the only external connection is with OpenAI. It's just like asking ChatGPT for help with queries, but in a streamlined way.\nIf you'd download our free IDE and try to break it, we'd love to hear what you come up with!\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39781418\nPoints: 24\n# Comments: 7",

          "description": "Ragas is an open-source library for evaluating and testing RAG and other LLM applications. Github: https://docs.ragas.io/en/stable/, docs: https://docs.ragas.io/.\nRagas provides you with different sets of metrics and methods like synthetic test data generation to help you evaluate your RAG applications. Ragas started off by scratching our own itch for evaluating our RAG chatbots last year.\nProblems Ragas can solve\n- How do you choose the best components for your RAG, such as the retriever, reranker, and LLM?\n- How do you formulate a test dataset without spending tons of money and time?\nWe believe there needs to be an open-source standard for evaluating and testing LLM applications, and our vision is to build it for the community. We are tackling this challenge by evolving the ideas from the traditional ML lifecycle for LLM applications.\nML Testing Evolved for LLM Applications\nWe built Ragas on the principles of metrics-driven development and aim to develop and innovate techniques inspired by state-of-the-art research to solve the problems in evaluating and testing LLM applications.\nWe don't believe that the problem of evaluating and testing applications can be solved by building a fancy tracing tool; rather, we want to solve the problem from a layer under the stack. For this, we are introducing methods like automated synthetic test data curation, metrics, and feedback utilisation, which are inspired by lessons learned from deploying stochastic models in our careers as ML engineers.\nWhile currently focused on RAG pipelines, our goal is to extend Ragas for testing a wide array of compound systems, including those based on RAGs, agentic workflows, and various transformations.\nTry out Ragas here https://colab.research.google.com/github/shahules786/openai-... in Google Colab. Read our docs - https://docs.ragas.io/ to know more\nWe would love to hear feedback from the HN community :)\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39780114\nPoints: 56\n# Comments: 17",

It supports `position`, `inline-block`, `z-index`, and complex properties like `float` and `vertical-align`. It doesn't support high-level layout like flexbox or grid yet, but you can get intrinsics to easily divide space yourself and paint multiple layout trees. It has a great text layout implementation, and supporting non-Latin scripts is a top priority.\nI've wanted this to exist as far back as 2013, and the desire kept coming up: for a way to get detailed intrinsics, for high quality rich text layout to canvas and SVG, and for server-side rich text. We currently use it in CellEngine for our new canvas-based spreadsheet library to layout text in hundreds of thousands of cells, and will be using it soon to render PDFs with thousands of pages in a few seconds.\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39778570\nPoints: 250\n# Comments: 85",

          "description": "Hi everyone!\nI’m excited to open source GritQL, a Rust CLI for searching and transforming source code.\nGritQL comes from my experiences with conducting large scale refactors and migrations.\nUsually, I would start exploring a codebase with grep. This is easy to start with, but most migrations end up accumulating additional requirements like ensuring the right packages are imported and excluding cases which don’t have a viable migration path.\nEventually, to build a complex migration, I usually ended up having to write a full codemod program with a tool like jscodeshift. This comes with its own problems:\n- Most of the exploratory work has to be abandoned as you figure out how to represent your original regex search as an AST.\n- Reading/writing a codemod requires mentally translating from AST names back to what source code actually looks like.\n- Performance is often an afterthought, so iterating on a large codemod can be painfully slow.\n- Codemod frameworks are language-specific, so if you’re hopping between multiple languages—or trying to migrate a shared API—you have to learn different tools.\nGritQL is an attempt to develop a powerful middle ground:\n- Exploratory analysis is easy: just put a code snippet in backticks and use $metavariables for placeholders.\n- Incrementally add complexity by introducing side conditions with where clauses.\n- Reuse named patterns to avoid rebuilding queries, and use shared patterns from our standard library for common tasks like ensuring modules are imported.\n- Iterate on large codebases quickly: we use Rust for maximum performance\nGritQL has already been used on thousands of repositories for complex migrations[1] but we're excited to collaborate more with the open source community.\n[1] Ex. https://github.com/openai/openai-python/discussions/742\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39770908\nPoints: 57\n# Comments: 16",

          "description": "Hi everybody, today I'm launching version 1.0 of Godspeed, a todo manager built with two priorities in mind: speed and 100% keyboard orientation. Every action in Godspeed can be done from your keyboard and will respond instantly. It's like Superhuman for your todo list.\nGodspeed has everything you expect in a todo manager like shared lists, labels, smart lists, boolean search operators, and cloud sync. If you're already a user of an app like Todoist or OmniFocus you should be able find everything you need in Godspeed.\nI think the most appealing thing to most HN users would be the keyboard orientation. Literally every single action in Godspeed is doable from your keyboard. I'm so serious about this that I built \"hardcore mode\" to completely disable the mouse - this both helps you break the habit of reaching for your mouse, and keeps us honest about 100% hotkey support.\nYou can fully customize the hotkeys, but if you're into Vim or Emacs you'll feel right at home by default.\nWe've got a 2 week free trial with no limitations, and then offer subscription or one-time purchase options.\nThanks for checking out Godspeed, I'd love to hear your feedback!\nhttps://godspeedapp.com/\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39756325\nPoints: 180\n# Comments: 132",

It's kind of like if Airtable/Notion built Salesforce today. https://okapicrm.com\nWhen I was fresh out of college, working for startups, Salesforce was this big mystery to me. It's the perpetual second screen for everyone in sales. They were building this gigantic obelisk downtown. What was this thing? And why did every salesperson I knew seem to live in it all day, and yet hate it so much?\nTurns out Salesforce is basically PhpMyAdmin for salespeople. It's just basically two things:\n1. A really generic database, and a UI for CRUDing your data.\n2. An API and ecosystem of integrations.\nIn other words, it's the back-office CRUD app to end all back-office CRUD apps.

Fast forward to today and there are countless alternatives available backed by incredible compute resources, yet we somehow still find ourselves paying the price of long development cycles. That's why I've been working for over a decade to simplify the development stack so we can spend more time on making 1's and 0's do magical things, and why my co-founder Michael and I started Flox …",

          "description": "Hello HN! Pierre and Paul here. We are building an open source text analytics tool for user inputs and LLM app outputs The repo is https://github.com/phospho-app/phospho and landing is https://phospho.ai\nMost people building with LLMs today don’t have quantified evaluation and usage metrics on the interactions between users and their product. The only solution is to read every message (or a sample) to get a sense of what is going on. You can't improve your product without understanding who your users are and how they are using it. Nobody would launch a website without standard analytics today; the same principle should apply to LLM products.\nWe made phospho to analyze the large amounts of text from user inputs and LLM app outputs, and give you quantified and actionable insights.\nYou first log messages and set up semantic events. Eg: “user is talking about sports”, “assistant didn’t quote the source”. We then run asynchronous jobs to detect if events are present in the text or not. To do so, we use GPT-4 for the first few events, and then downsize to smaller fine-tuned models (cheaper & faster). It works with any LLM provider (OpenAI, Mistral, Ollama…). No proxy, no monkey patch, and no OpenAI key needed.\nYou can link phospho to your users’ feedback, and even use the platform to annotate some messages yourself. This helps you design step by step a custom evaluation pipeline that runs automatically, fits your needs, and enables you to iterate.\nResults are available in dashboards, as dataframes, or via API. You can also directly leverage the events in your app to trigger actions in real-time with the API or via webhooks.\nDeploy everything with Docker, or use the hosted cloud version. We have Python/Javascript SDK and an API. License is Apache 2.0.\nGive it a spin and see where we’re at: https://github.com/phospho-app/phospho We’re interested in both feature requests and roasts. Let us know what you think!\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39692249\nPoints: 33\n# Comments: 4",

It’s like an IDE with Copilot, but instead of directly editing your code, it helps you come up with a solid plan before implementing a change. There’s a basic demo here (https://youtu.be/5uEapdT6nYE), and we also recorded a session with one of our early users running through an unusual task (calling a Fortran algorithm from Go, https://youtu.be/ppluB0Z1OIA)\nWhy use design docs? Mainly because on complex software projects, if you don’t have a careful strategy, a few lines of code can lead to a ripple effect across the whole codebase.

I've been reading everywhere that TPUs are powerful and a great alternative to NVIDIA.\nI have been playing with TPUs for a couple of months now, and to be honest I don't understand how can people use them in production for inference:\n- almost no resources online showing how to run modern generative models like Mistral, Yi 34B, etc. on TPUs\n- poor compatibility between JAX and Pytorch\n- very hard to understand the memory consumption of the TPU chips (no nvidia-smi equivalent)\n- rotating IP addresses on TPU VMs\n- almost impossible to get my hands on a TPU v5\nIs it only me? Or did I miss something?\nI totally understand that TPUs can be useful for training though.\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39670121\nPoints: 68\n# Comments: 28",

Here’s a demo video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MgfCyOyckQU&t=3s\nBillions of PDFs are generated daily: invoices, contracts, receipts, reports, you name it. Developer time gets wasted producing these basic documents because there are no good-enough tools to design and generate PDFs.\nWe previously worked at giant firms, where documents (especially PDFs) were central to most workflows. We got asked to generate automated trade confirmations for our customer’s counterparties. We could not find any tool other than outdated librari…",

          "description": "Tasks are a primitive for asynchronous programming and an alternative to working with threads directly. Instead of creating a thread, performing work, then waiting on it using synchronization primitives, you only define a unit of work and let a scheduler decide when and where to execute it. The threads that the scheduler uses are created once and reused for many tasks throughout the program's lifetime. In most cases, creating and executing a task requires not even a single syscall and is a significantly faster operation than creating a thread, resulting in lower latency. Furthermore, tasks from different subsystems can be automatically interleaved by the scheduler, which is difficult to achieve manually with threads without communication between the subsystems.\nThe library is written in standard C11 and only depends on the C POSIX library. It is designed to be easy to integrate into a project by just copying the header and simple enough to be understood in an afternoon.\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39667489\nPoints: 69\n# Comments: 21",

          "description": "Hello Hacker News! My name is Anonyo, and I am a seventeen-year-old from Southeast Michigan. This is wallstreetlocal, my passion project for the last year (and a half). I've posted this before, but I've finally open-sourced this entire project, so I thought I'd post it again.\nHeres the short pitch.\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) keeps record of every company in the United States. Companies whose holdings surpass $100 million though, are required to file a special type of form: the 13F form. This form, filed quarterly, discloses the filer's holdings, providing transparency into their investment activities and allowing the public and other market participants to monitor them.\nThe problem though, is that these holdings are often cumbersome to access, and valuable analysis is often hidden behind a paywall. Through wallstreetlocal, the SEC's 13F filers become more accessible and open.\nBy exploring the website (and the code), you can see the resources I used, check out some notable money managers I listed, and download any data that suits you. All for free. (Note, the mobile site likely needs work.)\nI made this project to better democratize SEC filings, and also to get some experience on my hands. I love computers, and one day hope to get involved with startups. In the comments, I'd appreciate any and all advice, as well as feedback on how to improve the site.\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39643833\nPoints: 144\n# Comments: 24",

          "description": "Hello HN, we're Gabe and Alexander from Hatchet (https://hatchet.run), we're working on an open-source, distributed task queue. It's an alternative to tools like Celery for Python and BullMQ for Node.js, primarily focused on reliability and observability. It uses Postgres for the underlying queue.\nWhy build another managed queue? We wanted to build something with the benefits of full transactional enqueueing - particularly for dependent, DAG-style execution - and felt strongly that Postgres solves for 99.9% of queueing use-cases better than most alternatives (Celery uses Redis or RabbitMQ as a broker, BullMQ uses Redis). Since the introduction of SKIP LOCKED and the milestones of recent PG releases (like active-active replication), it's becoming more feasible to horizontally scale Postgres…",

Here's a demo: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u0wAegt79EA\nInterest in designing new chips is growing, thanks to demand from AI and the predicted decline of Moore’s Law. All these chips need to be tested in simulation. Since the number of possible states grows exponentially with chip complexity, the need for verification is exploding. Chip developers already spend 70% of their time on testing. (See this video on the “verification gap”: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtaaOdGuMCc).\nTooling hasn’t kept up.

          "description": "Hi HN! I’m Gabriel, and I’m happy to share a project I’ve been working on for the last few years: Flyde, an open-source visual programming language. Check out the interactive examples and online playground on the website: https://www.flyde.dev.\nIn my last role as an engineering manager for a B2B-oriented product, I authored and reviewed many diagrams for backend applications, mostly for integrations between 2 third-party services. Some of these diagrams were elaborate enough that I started dreaming of a way to simply run a diagram as is; I imagined a “run” button on the top-right corner of the screen that would execute the diagram without the need to translate it into code.\nThat led me down a rabbit hole of exploration and experimentation, from tools like Zapier, Pipedream and Make, which are great for automating “backoffice” stuff, and up to NodeRED, NoFlo.js and the great work of J. Paul Morisson on Flow-Based Programming. I failed to find a tool that would answer my needs - a tool that balances a new level of abstraction, manages to stay powerful and flexible, and most importantly, integrates with the existing ecosystem, and doesn’t replace it. I built Flyde as an attempt to answer that need.\nFlyde is designed to complement and enhance traditional textual coding, not to replace it. It includes a VSCode extension, it seamlessly integrates with existing TypeScript/JavaScript code and can run on Node.js and in the browser.\nI believe that as we delegate more coding tasks to AI, we’ll assume the role of an architect rather than a programmer. This shift will require tools that focus more on orchestration and high-level troubleshooting and less on low-level functionality.\nI’d love to hear your thoughts and feedback on Flyde’s direction!\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39628285\nPoints: 185\n# Comments: 83",

          "description": "Hi HN! Erik here from Banana (formerly the serverless GPU platform), excited to show you what we’ve been working on next:\nFructose\nFructose is a python package to call LLMs as strongly typed functions. It uses function type signatures to guide the generation and guarantee a correctly typed output, in whatever basic/complex python datatype requested.\nBy guaranteeing output structure, we believe this will enable more complex applications to be built, interweaving code with LLMs with code. For now, we’ve shipped Fructose as a client-only library simply calling gpt-4 (by default) with json mode, pretty simple and not unlike other packages such as marvin and instructor, but we’re also working on our own lightweight formatting model that we’ll host and/or distribute to the client, to help reduce token burn and increase accuracy.\nWe figure, no time like the present to show y’all what we’re working on! Questions, compliments, and roasts welcomed.\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39619053\nPoints: 108\n# Comments: 62",

          "description": "Hi, I'm Will. I'm 24, autistic, and have OCD tendencies. I'm learning to code and this is my first public project. I’d really appreciate your feedback and encouragement!\nThis project lets me solve some of my OCD problems online. There are a couple of parts of the forums that I visit – Space Battles, Sufficient Velocity, and Questionable Questing – that I want to remove. Specifically, I hate seeing indicators of how much is left in a forum thread, because I keep thinking about how much content is left. It stops me from immersing myself in the story. It stressed me out. Before I learned to code, I'd use my hand to block the total chapter count so I could read the blurb and see the word count. I would do my best to ignore the page navigation bar except for the next page button, but I usually ended up failing. One of the reasons I always read in full-screen Safari is that I didn't have to see the tab name that always had the page number. I learned not to hover my cursor over the window because it would tell me the page number.\nThis project is a series of userscripts that hide those indicators. I coded the userscripts in JavaScript, and I used https://github.com/quoid/userscripts as the system. Despite the fact I didn't know what a userscript was until I started coding them, AI assistance allowed me to code them with minimal help from my brother, Stevie. Khanmigo helped me plan, write, and debug code. ChatGPT taught me the theory. Part of the reason I coded a lot faster with the later userscripts is I knew enough to realize when AI was talking about something irrelevant and redirect it. One cool moment was when I correctly predicted I didn't need to code different userscripts for SpaceBattles and Sufficient Velocity because Sufficient Velocity used to be part of SpaceBattles.\nI find it relaxing not to have to worry about accidentally seeing the chapter count or the final page number. Maybe they’ll help one of you!\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39618062\nPoints: 55\n# Comments: 17",

Developers use us to spend less time wrestling with codebases and more time actually writing code. Here's a demo: https://youtu.be/qI24eKO1YX0. You can try it on 100 popular repos here: https://app.greptile.com/repo, and on your own repo (if you give permission - more on that below) here: https://app.greptile.com.\nWe are far from the first people to try \"RAG on your codebase\". We focus on full codebase comprehension: using LLMs to accurately answer difficult questions with full context of large, complex, and even multi-repo codebases.\nSimple RAG alone is not sufficient for this task. Codebases aren’t like most PDFs, docs, or other similar data types. They are graphs—complex puzzle…",

Both vacuumed to a month of data using 0.4 and 0.9 GB respectively. Both greps are just an ID and return 6 lines.\n rsyslogd:\n /usr/bin/time -v zgrep $EG /var/log/$APP* Elapsed (wall clock) time (h:mm:ss or m:ss): 0:00.06 Maximum resident set size (kbytes): 2,996 \n journalctl:\n /usr/bin/time -v journalctl -u $APP* --output=short --no-pager -g $EG Elapsed (wall clock) time (h:mm:ss or m:ss): 2:04.23 Maximum resident set size (kbytes): 366,144 \n Avoiding journalctl is 4 orders of magnitude faster and 2 orders of magnitude less RAM consumption. A log inspection script that takes a minute with rsyslogd would take a year with systemd. Clearly journalctl was not designed to scale, as it looks like it's loading the entire log history into RAM in chunks before answering. rsyslogd bins logs by app and date so only what is needed is read from disk, and only just enough lines at a time in RAM to benefit from buffer speed.\n Edit (thanks small_kimono ):\n Or at least avoid using any journalctl features:\n /usr/bin/time -v journalctl | grep -P \" $APP/.*$EG\" Elapsed (wall clock) time (h:mm:ss or m:ss): 0:21.11 Maximum resident set size (kbytes): 322,456 \n unlike unit, grep is not quite as horrific:\n /usr/bin/time -v journalctl -g $EG | grep \" $APP/\" Elapsed (wall clock) time (h:mm:ss or m:ss): 0:08.43 Maximum resident set size (kbytes): 317,452 \n Still 2 orders of magnitude worse for speed and RAM, so stick to rsyslogd if you have an nontrivial log operations.\n    submitted by    /u/elatllat  \n [link]   [comments]",

I get why the misconception, as that is the most common usage of that word among the general public in regards of computing.\n The objective of this post is to ask you guys to come up with a phrase, slogan, whatever you want to call it, to express the meaning of 'stable' in terms of distributions. Ver much in the spirit of \"free as in freedom, not like free beer\".\n So far, the best one I have came up is \"stable like a marriage, not like a stool\".

          "description": "Hey folks!\n Many of us, probably almost everyone by now, have been following the XZ Utils situation. \n There have been many takes on how this was possible at all, both from the technical and the community point of view. The most security conscious have been overtaken by a sense of unease, especially as the most obvious question is posed: \"how many times has this happened?\".\n This level of paranoia is certainly warranted, it always was as some are coming to realize, but I would like us all to remind people that systems are not only valuable due to their inherent robustness. Systems and software are also valuable, robust as well as secure due to the checks and balances within the processes that create them and act as fail-safes when said robustness is compromised.\n Some are looking for culpability in FOSS, but a point I feel we should echo louder is that although FOSS might have delivered on its weaknesses it also, and most importantly, delivered on its strengths. This time we were lucky, and this constitutes an opportunity to galvanize the FOSS community and strengthen the processes and principles that have moved it forward.\n I'd be happy to hear your thoughts!\n    submitted by    /u/jdsalaro  \n [link]   [comments]",

Although this backdoor is likely only affects certain Linux desktop users, particularly those running unstable Debian or testing builds of Fedora (like versions 40 or 41), Could this be a sign that antivirus software should be more widely used on Linux desktops?\n ( I know this time is a zero-day attack)\n *What if*, malicious code like this isn't discovered until after it's released to the public? For example, imagine it was included in the initial release of Fedora 40 in April. What if other malware is already widespread and affects more than just SSH, unlike this specific case?\n My point is,\n  \nMany people believe that Linux desktops don't require antivirus software.\n Antivirus can at least stop malware once it's discovered.\n Open-source software is protected by many parties, but a backdoor like this one, which reportedly took 2 years to plan and execute, raises my concern about being more cautious when choosing project code maintainers.\n Linux desktops will likely be targeted by more attacks as they become more popular.\n  \nIMO, antivirus does not save stupid people(who blindly disable antivirus // grant root permission) but it does save some lazy people.\n OS rely heavily on users practicing caution and up-to-date(both knowledge and the system). While many users don't follow tech news, they could unknowingly be running (this/any) malware without ever knowing. They might also neglect system updates, despite recommendations from distro maintainers.\n  \nThis is where antivirus software can be useful. In such cases, users might be somewhat protected once the backdoor signature is added to the antivirus database.\n  \nThankfully, the Linux community and Andres Freund responded quickly to this incident.\n    submitted by    /u/curie64hkg  \n [link]   [comments]",

I have been using Mint exclusively so far, and have found it to suit my needs, but as is the inevitable case when presented with as much choice as the Linux community offers, I have been curious about switching to new DEs and distros. \n Cinnamon and Plasma both seem to be the top two “Windows-y” DEs, although my understanding is that they are built on two completely different platforms with Plasma using Qt and Cinnamon being split off from GNOME. So: For those of you who have experience with both of these DEs, which is your preference and why?

I installed Pop!_OS around 5 days ago, and in that time, I have:\n  \nLearned far more console commands than I would have by sticking with Windows\n Borked my audio so had to re-install my OS\n Borked my steam so had to reinstall many times\n Borked Docker so had shutdown issues\n  \nBut, you know something? I learned something each time since I had to diagnose it and fix it, and it gets more fun each time because its a realization of I am in complete control of my system.\n That is something I never had in Windows. I am going to remain a dual booter since there is a couple games that only work in Windows annoyingly, but as of right now, I only have a 150gb partition for Linux, I will look into getting a 2tb SSD for it soon and hopefully make it my main OS.\n Every time I run into a struggle, there is a solution. The community is very helpful (apart from a few people on this sub reddit lol)\n Also, gaming has came a LONG way! Steam has Proton built in, so it means running Windows native games is a breeze (for the majority, at least)\n So, for anybody who needs that little push to give Linux a go, go for it!

I was not allowed access to the internet growing up and never owned my own computer. But that did not stop me from finding ways on it. I was actively on the internet by using the iPod touch (before it was an iPhone) when they released WiFi capabilities on the Itouch. \n He got me a Chromebook and the very first thing I did was open google and head to oldschool.runescape.com. Jagex had JUST released OSRS and absolutely needed the nostalgia of flash1:wave2:cyan: buying gf1111!111!!!\n I was almost ready to play. All I had to do was install Java. Turns out, ChromeOS did not support Java.\n Not me googling, “how to hack your computer to install unsupported applications”\n Lo and behold, I discovered Ubuntu and dual booted it.

          "description": "I've recently been trying to better my understanding of core Linux concepts, and I want to test that knowledge... so, please help me out by critiquing my understanding of Firmware and Drivers.\n From what I've read, firmware is the code that makes hardware actually function on the lowest level, and it provides an API to simplify the general actions hardware can perform... like a speaker raising and lowering volume by altering input voltages. Then a driver's built to interact with that API endpoint to provide abstracted functionality of the hardware to the kernel.\n I think of this like interacting with a website. The website backend, like firmware, provides API endpoints for interacting with the websites core functionality (like reading and writing to and from databases). Then an example of a driver would be your browser & search engine interacting with the backend API to provide you with web pages, or to upload your data.\n I use to wonder why drivers didn't just interact with the hardware themselves, removing the need for firmware... but this would be the equivalent of your browser having to know how to run an sql query for user data on your websites backend, instead of having a backend API built by someone who can specifiy exactly how the database(s) should be interacted with, preventing any unsafe operations.\n    submitted by    /u/No-Tension2655  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I have read that paid Linux-focused development is mainly via companies paying their employees to contribute to Linux-based projects they depend on, or something like Redhat, focusing its efforts on Linux itself as a commercial product. And then there are the various appliances and fancy gadgets running Linux, which also involve a physical component (making them a paid product by default).\n But what about an individual or small independent team pouring their souls into a private software project and then trying to use it to earn an income? Is there any room in the Linux ecosystem for that 'business' model?\n I've donated to some of my favorite developers - including a handful of one-man bands - but something tells me a donation now and then isn't how they pay the bills.\n Somewhere along the way I developed this fantasy of really investing myself in my software projects and turning them into an income, but it just doesn't seem feasible, at least with Linux. The prospect of hiring onto a company completely ruins the whole idea of programming as a vocation for me.\n Any successful small teams or individuals out there? If so, how do you make it work?\n    submitted by    /u/Thossle  \n [link]   [comments]",

Why is that the case? Where are the open-source alternatives to GTA, EA Sports, Terraria, Hollow Knight, etc.?

The official driver from Epson (which one again, soon will not work) hasn't faired any better.\n Even if the printing was perfect, there's no layout software, no way for me to truly visualize what my print will look like after tinkering with sizing and borders, no way to assign an ICC profile to the print.\n All that just to say I've been forced to use windows or my phone to actually get the printer to spit out anything decent, how exactly am I supposed to take the future of printing seriously when the only method that will be supported just flat out lacks crucial functionality?

I won't go into the specifics of how I got the file size so low as that would be more appropriate for another group of people like r/asm or the people of GitHub (should I get a GitHub account and post the source there?), All that I'll mention here is that I succeeded and got the file size down to 977 bytes, and the steps to run it from that qrcode up there.\n Yep, I did what a few people have done when it comes to small programs, notably MattKC and Dave's Garage and put my little webserver in a qrcode.\n Warning: I trust my code to be safe and free of malware, but you shouldn't. Do not run any code you find online on your own machine. Please use a VM or a disposable device.\n Now to those of you who have either of these things (or just don't care) heres what to do.\n 1: scan the qrcode with zbarimg -1 --raw -Sbinary path/to/png > path/to/exe\n Note: zbar had an issue quite a while ago where it would fail to read qrcodes like this making the program unable to be run, please update zbarimg to the latest version or build it from source.\n 2: make it executable with chmod +x path/to/exe\n 3: run it with ./path/to/exe\n 4: connect to it. The port should be port 4050 so connecting to it should be as simple as going to localhost:4050 or 127.0.0.1:4050 in your webbrowser.\n I might make a GitHub account and post the source there. I'm just not sure that making a GitHub account souly for a Makefile and a 200 line asm file is a good idea.\n Either way, I hope you like it.\n    submitted by    /u/Skeleton590  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "On Ubuntu, I've noticed that, through their GUI \"Software\" interface, whenever it wants to update the OS in any way, it now always asks for a reboot pretty much every single time. Just like Windows does.\n You know, you just update a font and it's needlessly asking for a reboot. Just in case.\n Besides the fact that this seems utterly backwards on a server-class operating system like Linux, which is now even capable of updating the kernel without reboot via an appropriate service, to regress back to unnecessary consumer-desktop-class behaviour, isn't this also counter to the whole purpose of their \"snap\" format?\n In that containers seek to further isolate components from one another, so you can restart a container to refresh it, without needing to touch anything else about the system.

This is a huge architectural improvement for Inkscape, and will enable proper graphics acceleration in the future.\n This quick transition - only about 9 months - was made possible by donations, as the Inkscape project invested approx. $80,000 towards it. Support Inkscape's development: https://inkscape.org/support-us/donate/\n A lot of issues remain to be found and solved, especially on MacOS and Windows, so the next release will still use GTK3.

In comes KDE 6 w Wayland... nothing I do fixes the suspending bugs, and I'm basically forced to switch to GNOME after things get so messy that I have to reinstall arch due to the desktop crashing during pacman updates. So I switch to GNOME, which is a bit better, but the instability is still just... so bad. Brightness control is completely broken when I'm in hybrid graphics mode, even when I'm just using plain old X11 - it stays at 100% no matter what (at least KDE could implement acpi_backlight=nvidia_wmi_ec correctly). I can't really use wayland because of glitching and flickering on XWayland that messes up chrome, again something that KDE actually does correctly despite Nvidia's crappy driver... I can't logout and log back in sometimes when I'm on hybrid graphics mode...\n Basically the only working Wayland implemention is KDE's, which is very unstable right now. GNOME's just completely shits the bed anytime an XWayland application is needed on Nvidia hardware, and it's already a pita for anything hybrid graphics related compared to KDE when it's actually stable. The only option I have for a usable system right now is to turn off hybrid graphics, use GNOME on X11 and have my laptop die in the middle of classes. I'm seriously considering going back to Windows for a couple months because it just seems like there will be more issues and they will continue to get worse until things are (maybe) resolved later\n    submitted by    /u/espercent  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I have been several years testing distros, not so many to be honest, but there have been a bunch. Up to this point, I reached the thinking that if you want to have a stable distro, your main choice is Debian, while in contrary, if you want bleeding edge packages, you may run Arch (or another rolling release). Yes, there are a lot of different distros out there, but to me feels like you can achieve most of what they can do with Arch or Debian, because they are basically forks of them (kinda I'm at the sustainable peak at the Linux Dunning-krugger effect).\n ​\n Now I use Debian, but for me, pisses me off not receiving updates for weeks. The system is pretty stable, and is a solid base, but that fact, pisses me off. I used to have (and love) Fedora, which, for me, was that sweet spot between rolling release and stable release, but how RHEL behaves lately, pisses me off, and sadly, it made me move away from Fedora. So yeah, I try to stay away from the more \"corporative/privative-like\" distros (so yeah, no Ubuntu also), because if I had to go with that, I'd just stick to Windows.\n ​\n So yeah. I cannot feel relaxed with Arch with the possibility to breaking up just updating the system (I know is something you can avoid if you stay away from AUR, but still is a posibility), and I am tired of falling behind on updates for being in Debian, so I am ready to test new things. Maybe, I can give another opportunity to Arch, or even, try new stuff, such as Open SUSE for example, but I would like to know if the specific distro you might suggest receives updates from time to time, and also, if it is stable, and I can feel relaxed on the system breaking on me.\n [EDIT]: Some of you have said me that RHEL is an upstream of Fedora, and not the other way around, so sorry for the inconvenience, and that may be an option. Also, for now, I have also considered openSUSE Tumbleweed, but I have to give it a try firstly.\n    submitted by    /u/Raulduri  \n [link]   [comments]",

I wanted to use the plethora of iTerm2 color schemes on Linux and I found a project on GitHub that could do it, but I had to tweak code to make it work. I then found that it only did half the job. You have to append the list of profile ID in dconf or the profile, while imported, won't be available for use.\n The basis for my code was this repo. It kinda works but, like I said, I had to tweak it make it fully usable. I created a new repo, and I did credit the original because their work helped me accomplish my goal.\n I hope you find it useful. I've used it to import about 20 color schemes without any issues.\n https://github.com/gdanko/iterm-color-to-gnome-terminal\n ​\n ​\n    submitted by    /u/eeeeeeradicator  \n [link]   [comments]",

So threw hands in the air and started binging Linux OS videos on YouTube. \n My initial attempts were with virtual box... couldn't get it to work. So ended up creating USB ISO files and just sorta kept failing at booting or installing distros until FINALLY, I just totally replaced Windows with Zorin 17.1 OS.

The script takes away words with upper-case letters, roman numerals, words with apostrophe and words containing letters with accent marks.\n 4 letter words get 1 point.\n Bigger words get 1 point for every letter.\n Words containing ALL given letters, get a bonus of 7 extra points.\n  \nThe name SPELION was just a made up word with letters that could form the root spel(l), while at the same time these letters could appear in a (recursive) Spelion puzzle.

More like a well-used car that has a good paint job still.\n I know, I know. Some of you are going to claim this doesn’t apply to Linux since Linux is an OS or kernel, with a billion different flavors, and not a website. \n But we have been seeing it in Windows IMO since version 8 or 10. Maybe sooner for some folks. We’ve seen it in iOS as the fruit phones and laptops, etc. have not really put out anything mind-blowing or usefully new except the M1 chip.\n When is the last time NVIDIA or AMD really put out something huge like we used to see back in the day? I’m talking GPU, not CPU. The fact that Intel could create their own dGPU and start releasing products at the midrange audience in their first generation of Arc cards should cause a question to form.\n Linux seems to be the only thing that I use on a daily basis that hasn’t started this platform decaying yet. Is it because we are forced to learn how to use Linux, or maybe we see this cool programs like Vi or Kile, maybe a command like awk or grep, and we fixate on it until we beat it to death and move on to the next thing? Or is it that we keep learning because we want to learn more?\n Mind you, I’m not an analyst or even have a college degree.

Hypothetically speaking.\n feel free to discuss and propose your ideas.\n i'd say let's take a look what is NOT making GNU/Linux the most popular OS, end user wise.\n First, Microsoft's marketing - From their promotional video featuring the hit \"Start me Up\", their partnerships, marketing towards desktop users, then as windows dominated the market share, people started making games and programs mainly for Windows, which is one of the main reasons why people don't want to switch. Also, it's pre installed, when you go to a regular store all the laptops have windows installed unless they're MAC's, heck, many people don't even know what an operating system is.\n Somebody pointed out, that there's so many distros people would have dilemma which one to choose, so somebody proposed that making a 'general'/'official', user friendly distro which would be marketed and advertised, and it would be the default option to consider for companies making software would help it.\n Because proprietary there's a whole company, but there are many Linux distros (not like it's bad, but i'm speaking of general users)\n    submitted by    /u/exiled-redditor  \n [link]   [comments]",

So how does the community ensure the quality and standard of the code base?\n The reason behind asking this question is, I work for a large company where there are say around 50 developers across two development centers (both in different countries) and we are having this problem where we are not able to maintain the modularity of the code. The developers in our center develop the code differently, the developers in other country develop it differently. This difference is causing a lot of problems. Because when we use their base code, we are not able to modify it as efficiently as we should. And I think they face the similar problem. \n So what process does Linux uses to maintain the quality, especially the modularity of the code base?\n    submitted by    /u/4ChawanniGhodePe  \n [link]   [comments]",

There are plenty of good free powerful software that are windows only. Plus, all of my game library with my Nvidia card.\n Now, I have spent most of my adult life using Linux. I discovered it as a teenager but it took some time for me to fully transition. Now at 33 nearly 34, it is more comfortable to me than any other system, way above macOS which still use because MacBooks are the best laptops for me.\n The point of this post is that while I don't feel I wasted my time, it has made me appreciate what I truly value in a computing system and in life in general: Having as much control of your environment as possible.\n I recently started photographing again, and where I thought I would be using good software exlusive to windows, the best are open source and available in all platforms. I do not use LightRoom, I will never pay Adobe. I will miss the proprietary software that the camera companies make for editing RAW files, but I have so many options it does not matter.\n Gaming is a trifle now. The kind of games I like to play can either run on proton or have a linux release. \n More than can control, it is owning the production. It feels so limiting to ever wait on companies to make the things you want. Something propriety is not something I can own. The world I want to live in is one where information is freely shared, bettering everyone.\n I will now end this poorly thought out rant and rave.\n    submitted by    /u/DestructiveDumbass  \n [link]   [comments]",

I tracked either the generic package or a shell/wm package for these stats. Of course a lot of discrepancies come from Debian being more of an enterprise/stable distro, for example more KDE users would most likely be on Arch instead.\n Out of 135773 downloads:\n * GNOME (gnome-shell) - 44.15%\n * XFCE4 (xfwm4) - 23.3%\n * KDE Plasma (plasma-desktop) - 18.72%\n * Cinnamon (cinnamon-desktop-environment) - 7.5%\n * LXQT (lxqt) - 3.63%\n * i3wm (i3-wm) - 2.7%\n * Sway (sway) - 0.91%\n    submitted by    /u/ThePix13  \n [link]   [comments]",

Upon stepping into the booth and starting to learn about how the mixerboard and basic AV setup works, I noticed 2 separate PCs set up - a basic HP gaming laptop running only Streamlabs for the live feed and a second desktop that basically does everything else (recording, playing videos/music, sharing song lyrics on the remote dual mounted displays, etc). I noticed that the desktop was running Ubuntu Mate and asked the AV guy about it. Simply put, his response was \"It just works and the lower headroom of Linux completely eliminated random freezing and glitches during church services\".\n To be fair, the desktop itself was running an older Pentium processor with only 4 GB of RAM, but the fact that the church's reason for using Linux to essentially power their daily services because it \"simply works\" was a really eye-opening experience for me and a reminder that Linux as a desktop is definitely not just a hobbyist OS and gave me an even greater level of respect for the open source apps that we often take for granted.\n    submitted by    /u/chozendude  \n [link]   [comments]",

The rendering itself is amazing with defaults; however, the biggest problem was the regular weight font thinness on small sizes with grayscale antialiasing (AA). Subpixel AA is a no-go for me, as my eyes simply cannot stand its color fringing. Thus began my journey to \"perfection\".\n A few months before I started gathering all the information and made a small project with a set of advanced tweaks for FreeType, including customized stem-darkening with multiple presets to make it more pleasing to the eye, and just finished setting up a public repository.\n Without further ado, if anyone is interested in trying it, here it is: https://github.com/maximilionus/freetype-envision\n Project is still young, no packages are yet available, but a small install-uninstall scripts with a \"nice\" README are already here.

          "description": "So I found an interesting way to stress test a single CPU core/thread with bc while watching a YouTube video. Calculate a perfect number using a 7 digit seed.\n So a perfect number is any number where if you add the divisors, including 1 but not itself, you get that number. A good example is 6 which has the divisors 1, 2, and 3. So 1+2+3=6 hence it is a perfect number. You can find any perfect number by the following formula: (2p - 1) * 2p-1 where (2p - 1) equals any prime number. Of course you can just take the equation and plug in number for p that you want and get a result but it won't be perfect.\n So I went and ran the equation in bc and tested it out for a bit. Up to a 5 digit number and my computer had no issue. I switched from random numbers, or as random as my fingers can get on a number pad, to all 9s for the fun of it with 5 digits, because 5 9s and all that. My computer had no issues with those 5 9s but did give a bit of a pause with 6. So I went with 7 and bc spit back an error. Ok back to bash then to try it one more time and this time it worked. With p=9999999 my computer took 6 minutes and 13.032 seconds, according to time, to complete the equation. I'd say not bad for a 9th gen i7 in a laptop.\n Of course this doesn't count for any benchmarks but it was fun.\n Edit: Fixed the perfect number explanation.\n    submitted by    /u/MonsterRideOp  \n [link]   [comments]",

Great, right? So I ordered a cheap 128gb drive to swap it with, BUT when installing any linux distro the installers cannot see this 128gb drive and I don't know why.

I delete the other partitions. I expand the one existing one.\n First GParted decided that in order to expand the NTFS partition, I HAD to \"move the filesystem to the left\". I was perfectly fine leaving it on the right end and leaving the left end blank, but nope, \"move to the left and grow\" is one operation and I had no way to opt out. Fine. I guess.\n I started the operation, and the expansion took about 5 seconds and it even auto mounted the partition for a few seconds. So I was right. But then GParted helpfully unmounted it for me and started transferring 1.3TB from one end of the drive to the other.\n It's been running for almost 12 hours now. This is in a VirtualBox VM with the disk passed through as a raw USB device.\n I went to move the window between monitors. It naturally turned into a tiny square when I dragged it over. When I let go and the window expanded (back to an identical resolution even), it showed me what you see in this screenshot. My transfer, canceled. And now the \"rollback\" is longer than what was remaining.\n No confirmation prompt. Nothing. It just...canceled a working low level drive operation. How, GParted devs, do you think this is acceptable?!?!?!\n Will you please just let go of my drive???\n    submitted by    /u/gjack905  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "So recently I had a very specific problem at work. My simulation created a 27 GB txt log file (on purpose for debugging purposes) and I wanted to streamline the text file to analyze the log file more easily.\n I tried the most obvious way to just open it with a text editor, both GUI or CLI and surprise surprise that did not work. My temp folder is not big enough to load 27 GB text file. So i was at a loss of what to do, how to do i streamline this log file if I can not open it.\n Then I remembered of this tool that i heard of but never really paid attention to know as \"awk\". At first it seemed like magic just typing random letters like \" '$0 ~ // {}' \". How does this magic even work? But it was my only option for this so i tried. I learned it quite fast and I managed to streamline my log file from 27 GB to 200 MB in 2 awk commands. It took exactly 10 sec to write it in the terminal and for it to finish.\n I was amazed. I am now a HUGE fan of awk and will use it as much as i can. It is now my go to tool for txt file manipulation.\n Honestly, I do not know how I would solve this problem on Windows, is there a thing like awk for windows?\n ​\n Anyway, this got me thinking, what else am i sleeping on.

A couple of days later, I received a link to a technical exercise on devSkiller. The exercise includes 25 multiple-choice questions and 2 Python programming tasks, to be completed in 30 and 40 minutes respectively.\n I'm feeling completely lost on what to prepare for this assessment. Although I'm confident in my data structures and algorithms skills, I'm genuinely anxious about this assessment.\n I've reached out to the recruiter for guidance, but haven't received a response in two days. I've searched online for helpful interview experiences, but haven't found anything relevant.\n I'm a new grad, and given the current market situation, I got this opportunity after so much efforts, and I don't want to mess it up.\n If anyone who has gone through the Canonical assessment for a Python Engineer role could provide some insights, I would greatly appreciate it.\n    submitted by    /u/openTruthSeeker  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "GNOME seems to like to copy the macOS window overview and combined titlebar/toolbar philosophy (CSD). But it seems they've done this without actually understanding what makes it work on Mac.\n On Mac you have the global menu. It lets apps have a vast amount of commands, and they're easily browsable. Menu search is even included by default at the OS level and you can set keyboard shortcuts on anything. This lets apps like Terminal have no controls at all on the window but still plenty of power user features.\n Since GNOME moved away from a global menu, all controls not on the toolbar are forced to fit in the hamburger menu. This means what goes in there is usually drastically reduced, and/or the menu is huge and unwieldy. It also creates this persistent meaningless icon in every app that you have to click and remember what's there and what's not, unlike a menu which can have descriptive text reminding you of what it contains.\n CSD doesn't work well without a global menu, and the hamburger button is a bad band-aid. So what is the actual goal or philosophy behind it? Saving vertical pixels by removing a menu isn't very convincing, given the size of screens and the thickness of header bars. The header bars are less customizable than toolbars and offer less space to click and move the window. The hamburger menu takes longer to navigate and visually parse. It's not simpler, so I don't understand what was accomplished.\n    submitted by    /u/tectak  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "My son (teen) has been using Linux (Mint) since he was young because that's what I installed at home. Although I gave him admin rights on his computer, he never really delved into it, for instance, learning to use the terminal.\n Last week was spring break, a time to enjoy video games! He has many games on Linux (with Steam and Proton, it's easy). However, a popular game wouldn't work. He talked to me about it and started asking questions about Windows...\n A few days later, he went to meet friends and left his computer on. I walked past his room and saw a Windows login screen!!! Holy crap! I felt a bit disappointed inside... there it was, he had jumped ship, moved to the dark side, replacing Linux with Windows. Darn!\n The next day, he came to me in a good mood because he could finally play that game. He then started explaining how he used GParted, did a Chroot because Windows had erased Grub, and then played with Efibootmgr to prevent Windows from erasing grub again, among many other advanced tricks.\n Wow! he had set up a dual boot by himself and developed an incredible interest in Linux. I was amazed.\n    submitted by    /u/hwoodice  \n [link]   [comments]",

Although Linux adoption/use continues to grow in other regions/markets, growth remained relatively flat last year outside of India.\n As I understand it from reading and from friends, the reason that Linux adoption/use in India has roughly doubled in the last year, and is expected to continue to grow, is that India's Ministry of Electronics & Information Technology (MeitY) has been aggressively pushing BOSS, an India-centric Debian-based distribution developed by C-DAC, an autonomous society of MeitY.\n As I think about the developments in India, t…",

Flatpak can handle different architectures, you can even install it on Raspberry Pi OS and download packages for the ARM architecture, however many applications are only built for x86_64 systems.\n I searched online for a bit, and it seems you can use QEMU to run x86_64 on ARM (or vice-versa) and it seems to work quite well (link). I've also searched trying to see if there is an easy way to run flatpaks using Box64, but I haven't found any straightforward instructions.\n When Apple introduced M1 they automatically handled app architecture translation using Rosetta.\n So my question to all of you is, should Flatpak consider automatically running x86_64 applications using box64/box86 for ARM devices?

After that, I tend to uninstall or not use those tools anymore (in the case of Tauri and that kind of dev tools), but by doing that it leaves me with a bunch of packages in the system that I manually installed, and now I don't know exactly which packages are in use or are just leftovers there that are updated every day.\n Then I discovered Brew and what I thought was: \"What if I use Brew just to install my dev tools and track what I use or not from there\", seriously, Almost every time I do an update there is a pile of \"rust-{whatever}\" to be updated.\n Does this make any sense? There is a better way to handle the leftovers of dev tools and packages manually installed to build from source?\n P.S: Now I tend to manually note what I'm installing to manually uninstall it too, as a workaround.\n    submitted by    /u/pkcarreno  \n [link]   [comments]",

A talking point I see come up a lot in linux desktop conversations is font rendering and how people usually say it sucks, but enabling stem darkening for freetype (linux's font rendering engine) largely fixes the issue entirely.\n ​\n https://blog.aktsbot.in/no-more-blurry-fonts.html\n The difference in font legibility after pasting this one line into /etc/environment and rebooting is crazy\n Stem darkening is what macOS uses to get their fonts looking so crisp. Of course, you're not going to get the same level of fidelity if you're not using an Apple retina display, but even on my average 1080p monitor this makes a huge difference. Why is this option not enabled on any distro? What's the point in having this option built into freetype and leaving it unconfigured for every desktop user?

          "description": "This might seem silly but I've been using Linux Mint 21 since September and I haven't used the terminal for anything. I'm not new to Linux, nor am I just a dabbler. I used Linux back in high school for my IT classes, I used it on my personal laptop, and I've switched between Linux and Windows over the years on my main PC. I also use Linux at work and work with Linux servers often. \n Back in September, I switched to Linux Mint 21 as my daily driver. My goal was to use Windows as sparingly as humanly possible. I did it for myself and my privacy, but I also wanted to prove some points, and one of those points was, you can use Linux Mint without using the terminal at all. And... I was correct. \n People, especially skeptics (who don't even use the OS), say that Linux is complicated and you can't do anything without opening up the terminal. I use Linux daily for browsing the internet, being in calls with friends, playing games like Sea of Theives, Battlefield, GTA, and much more. I use it for work, education, and even to record and edit. So far, since September, I haven't needed the terminal for anything. I installed via the GUI; either by going to the official site, or going through the software store. \n ​\n I also helped prove to one of my friends that Linux isn't as bad as it used to be, even letting him play some games and use the system for a while. He's willing to install a small 500GB drive with a Linux distro on it. I consider that a win since he's normally worried about games and other software not working like it should. \n Since you've been using Linux, what is something you would like to bring to the table that might be considered helpful for new people / outsiders. Mine obviously was, with the right distro, you won't need the terminal, it's helpful but not vital. \n    submitted by    /u/BouncyPancake  \n [link]   [comments]",

I'm posting here, because as far as I am aware, the only OS with open source implementations of host/device switching is Linux (with the kernel's gadget APIs).\n I'm not at all expecting an immediate response to this thread, since gadget mode is a niche topic, just curious if anyone has seen anything for this OS (or potentially for this OS).\n I haven't dug into USB-IF yet much either. I plan to. I'm just not entirely sure how to navigate their forum yet.\n    submitted by    /u/anonhostpi  \n [link]   [comments]",

Completely and utterly, it would only boot via USB and despite hours of scouring the web I found no solutions for Windows.\n Ultimately I decided to bite the bullet and backup all the data and do a fresh install. I tried installing Windows 7 but for whatever horrible reason none of the ISOs I managed to find worked. They were clean ISOs that should have had no issues but despite this it just didn't work.\n And because of the Windows 7 activation being gone I felt that I had to install Windows 10 for peace of mind. However, I regretted it almost immediately as that computer is a potato. …",

I think the longest I've ever used the same theme+layout is for a few months. And, honestly, I'm just tired.\n This didn't use to be a problem on Windows. I was perfectly happy with the way every mainstream version of Windows looked between 98 (my first OS) and 7. Kinda disliked 8 and REALLY disliked 10, mainly because it was flat. Although after I switched to Linux I realized that Windows 10 was actually relatively decent because it let you pick the primary color, which affected the panel and the title bar.

          "description": "I got the Oneplus 12 because of its DC dimming and higher PWM at lower brightness, but after a week with it, I was itching to switch back to my S23 Ultra. Thoughts:\n Negatives: 1) Nova Launcher doesn't work smoothly with gesture controls, there's a noticeable lag when I swipe to home. I thought it won't be a big deal, but couldn't stand it after a few days. \n 2) I miss the One Hand Application app for Samsung, that gave me a bunch of side of the screen gesture actions. I tried a few apps off the Google play store but I couldn't find one as reliable. \n 3) I miss the S pen, good for precise actions, remote camera triggers, and the occasional live sketch. \n 4a) I found the colors on the Samsung generally more accurate, with the Oneplus giving most photos a warmer tint than irl. Oneplus sometimes seem to have sharper images though, but that might be due to processing. Night photos and videos seem better on the Samsung. \n 4b) I also miss the 10x camera, which is great for travel and animal photography. \n 4c) No motion photos on the default oneplus camera app. I like the little snippets of video attached to each photo.\n 5) One UI just feels more polished as an OS, more finalized and less improvised. \n 6) Samsung Pay turns NFC on and off automatically which seems more secure to me. \n Positives 1) The screen does feel slightly more comfortable on the OnePlus, so I might switch back to it if my eye strain comes back. I can see the flicker in the Samsung if I wave my fingers across the screen when it's dim.\n 2) I can't seem to get true blacks in dark mode in a few apps on the Samsung, like Instapaper, while the Oneplus has it. \n 3) Screen off gestures are pretty convenient on the oneplus, especially the torch.\n 4) The oneplus is lighter and less bulky. \n 5) The haptics are stronger and feel more satisfying on the oneplus. \n 6) Battery life seems longer and charging is faster. \n Anyone have thoughts that might make me change my mind again? \n    submitted by    /u/onedeering  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "OP 在国内有 11 年 Java 开发经验，待过迅雷，阿里，微众，众安，坡县的一家交易所。迫于个人性格，工作压力，小崽崽的未来，然后 2021-03 跟媳妇商量好一起润。研究过关于新西兰，加拿大，日本，新加坡，德国，后面阴差阳错选择了瑞典，一直到 2022-09-09 登陆瑞典。现在在阿斯利康做自动化测试（偏开发，就是因为我之前是开发，测试组的 leader 选择要我）。\n之所以今天发这个贴子，完全是因为早上跟一个快拿香港身份的朋友聊天，开着玩笑，说我可以做一个关于瑞典生活和工作的付费咨询。这个事情，我是没有想过的，毕竟，这个完全不是我的风格。从 2022-09 开始，v2ex 上加我咨询瑞典和润的人应该不下 30 来个了，全部都毫无保留的分享了我所有知道的信息。如果有加我的 v2er 看到了，可以作证我没说假话，哈哈~~~\n之所以今天发这个贴子，说到有偿，确实是因为现在缺钱了。我跟我媳妇认识之前，她在惠州买了一套房子，现在贷款还剩 50w ，但是我们现在 45w 都卖不掉，完全没人买。所以，今年在想着多赚点钱，能赚点是一点，早点把贷款还了吧。瑞典的生活成本很高，我媳妇又不能工作，一个人养一个家，确实攒不了啥钱。这个要是放到我来瑞典之前，这些都说不是个事儿。\n当然，钱不钱的都不重要，只要找到我的，我还是知无不言言无不尽，这个我相信我人品还是在那儿。愿意给我小孩发个红包的， 我现在也不会拒绝，哈哈（上次真有个哥们说给我宝宝发个红包，我给拒绝了）。肯定是先聊，然后自愿打赏哈。害怕我区别对待的，应该可以去翻我 v2 的回答历史记录，应该看得出来，我不是这种人，哈哈…………\n可以咨询的内容：\n瑞典的生活和工作\n润相关的信息\n个人能力，这一点就偏软实力（技术能力我自己都不咋的，确实给不了啥意见）。可以说说我的认知里面，如何提高自己的工作能力。关于这点，我只能说我的工作能力，一直让我是一个团队里面的核心开发。前几天找我之前的领导借钱，转手就给我转了 18W, 这种信任还是很难得的。\n个人建议是跟我聊之前，尽量自己准备一下自己想聊的问题，可以提前发给我，让我看看，如果我不知道的，我可以去问问我这边的同事，这样才会比较有效率。\n如果不喜欢的，你就当没看到。之所以发这个贴子，一个是帮助像我之前在准备润的时候的人，另一个是有点外快更好，没有，我也无所谓，毕竟我都开始读《圣经》，开始信基督了，哈哈。。。你可以理解我只是没在传教，但是在传“润”了。\n最后，我现在也有参与一个 Web3 的社区，偶尔也能有点事情做，有点钱，所以，至于这个，我更多是倾向能帮助到有需要的人。毕竟，我觉得我现在的生活，还是值得的，除了攒不了钱，过上了我以前想要的生活。\n邮箱：eXVhbmhvbmdiaW45MDkwI2dtYWlsLmNvbQ== ， 记得换一下符号。",

          "description": "曾经作为一个学生年轻气盛，放弃了保博/北京户口的机会。机缘巧合又来到了北京，作为一个资深大数据工程师，因为经常加班的原因错过了很多考公/事业单位的机会。当来到 35 岁，不能不承认已经错过了很多，有时候回忆起来确实会有一些遗憾，希望自己能再重来一次该多好。看到大家都在问学历提升的问题，把自己这两年打听到的的给大家说说，包括那些遥不可及的工作。\n关于前期教育\n现在中考分流搞的大家怨声载道，确实我们无法左右政策，有些家底比较厚的家长，可以考虑提前给孩子办理香港身份，或者提前为出国做准备。比如北美或者欧洲的永居，现在有些国家是稍微宽松的，但是一个问题是高中阶段的学习需要国外完成，课程是 IB ，这个需要有人陪读，后续可以在国外读本硕博也可以参加华侨联考（华侨联考考回国内大学也有类似于预科的班级）。\n如果高考失利，可以考虑走联合办学那种，最后可以拿国外的大学本科学历，回来走留服认证。也可以直接去国外读本科。本科+一年水硕的性价比，其实现在来看也可以接受。\n关于中期教育\n如果上的是大专，那么专升本只有一次机会，而且是省内院校。当然，如果大专上完去当兵，回来专升本是有一次且仅有一次免试专升本的机会。如果上面的机会都错过了，在国内提升学历的前提下，有两种选择，一是工作 2 年-5 年考取研究生，但是在复试阶段不占优势，这也是一个比较无奈的事情，毕竟在没有人引荐的情况下被刷下来的概率还是很大的。另一条路是自考/成人高考提升到本科，我作为面试官在筛选简历时会留意，但是没有办法，大环境就是这样。\n关于本科以上的教育（涉及北上广深户口）\n目前看除了积分落户，本科北京落户相对于此前规模确实放开了，但是只针对那几所指定的学校（可以搜搜），硕士（含水硕）应届拿到的概率会比较大，包括各行业的人才引进。如果是应届，那么能读硕士还是尽量读。如果是往届，那么国外水硕是短期提供学历提升的最好的办法。水硕大部分人认为分两种，一种需要再海外待 366 天拿留服认证，另外一种可能是只为了满足积分落户硕士分的需求，想提高积分但是又不需要很大时间成本，那么在海外不需要待够 366 只需要每年几十天就行。但是（划重点）--很多人忽略了第三种，那就是在口罩期间，很多人无法到国外，因此才有了硕士学历补录的方式，目前看性价比最高，不用出国，直接拿硕士留服认证，当然，这种是无法以具备 366 天海外经历的留学生来做人才引进的。\n当然，很多人也想拿个博士，国内博士需要带着项目才有可能被导师接收的（个别情况例如，本校保送/考试取得，导师推荐除外），除非有人引荐。我们大部分人的父辈应该都没有这个资源，但是国外水博虽然快也需要 2-3 年，至于坚持在国内读的自己先准备 50 个把。划重点--关于水博也有口罩期间类似的政策，不过都过去两年了，可能很快就会取消了。\n其实很多企业博士后入站是可以提供集体户口的，至于是否接就看你们个人能力了。\n关于工作\n35 以后很难进 YQ/GQ ，那是因为我穷。其实那些耳闻能详的 YQ 的招聘其实是有操作空间的，只能说这么多 TAT 。\n结束语\n可能本人能力有限，知道的有些片面，欢迎大家再补充。因为家底薄，暂时还离开不了互联网，秉承的原则是为下一代攒点。",

          "description": "我以前写过 React ，现在想学 Next.js 。跟着官方教程在学它的那个教程。\n学到 chapter 11: Partial Pre-rendering 越学越迷茫，我不懂它说的某些功能的表现是怎么样的，虽然我看得懂它教程里说的内容，这个框架是挺美好的，但是实际用起来真的很奇怪。\n教程里说使用 unstable_noStore() ，给一个服务端组件的 API 层，可以禁用 cache ，这样可以让一些用户间不共享的信息，在用户请求的时候可以实时更新。问题是我就算吧这个 noStore 注释了，每次我刷新页面的时候，对应的 API 方法又重新调了。这就和我理解的冲突了，不是说服务端渲染好的页面，只要不是 dynamic 的（用了 noStore 就是 dynamic ），就不会那么快实时更新吗？而且我怕只看 API 方法重新调不合适，说不定它框架里做了从调用上看不出来的缓存。。然后我跑去 vercel 上 update 了数据库，好家伙，一刷新页面，修改了的数据立马反映出来了。。那是不是说明这个服务端根本不是静态渲染的，而是默认动态的，那我加不加这个 noStore 不是一摸一样吗？我去外网和官方文档上找，它说这个就是加了个 http header 。。具体有用没用好像是看网页客户端的，但是我这个不是服务器请求服务器吗？哪来的网页客户端，不是 nodejs ，或者这里是因为 nodejs 模拟了浏览器内核的缘故吗？\n这个 Next.js 是不是有什么问题？我在测试这个缓存过没过期的时候，随便搜就搜到了这个帖子，它贴的官方文档说 dynamic 是 5s ，static 是 30s ，然后我又觉得这个缓存不起效可能和我一直在点刷新有关，我是不是应该在应用内点跳转链接，然后机缘巧合之下，我在等 30s 之后，开始点页面内的 navigation ，好家伙每点一下，API 方法就被调用一次。。下面是我弄的计算方法执行时间的 log：\ncost time: 773ms\n Fetching revenue data...\n cost time: 699ms\n Fetching revenue data...\n cost time: 213ms\n Fetching revenue data...\n cost time: 231ms\n Fetching revenue data...\n Fetching revenue data...\n cost time: 216ms\n Fetching revenue data...\n cost time: 215ms\n Fetching revenue data...\n Fetching revenue data...\n cost time: 246ms\n Fetching revenue data...\n cost time: 647ms\n\n而且我在 vercel 的[云服务上也复现]（ https://nextjs-dashboard-kappa-amber-64.vercel.app/dashboard ）了，有兴趣的可以等个三十秒，然后疯狂点那个 home 的按钮实时，每点一下就来一个网络请求，但是不知道这个网络请求是干嘛的，但是我本地的 dev 确实打这些 log 了。而且刚刚刷新，进去网站的时候，你就算疯狂点，也只会加载一次（ api 方法也只调了一次），等个 30s 就这样了，是不是有什么问题。\n写的有点长了感觉，但是这个 next.js 我是真越学越晕啊，各位如果有兴趣可以试一试，另球球前端大佬指点（我又来白嫖网友力量了嘿嘿 OWO ），在下先行拜谢！",

          "description": "我的博客原文： https://blog.licsber.site/2024/03/29/人月神话的困境/\n很多“聪明人”的思维都是线性思维，拿到任务，分解成小项，逐个完成，一步一步的像是在做证明题：期待着攒够一个又一个的事实和推理，最后拼图一般将它们串起来，达成某项任务。逻辑层面上看起来无懈可击，仿佛一切困难都可迎刃而解。\n不可否认的是这套思维在应试方面屡试不爽，因为有一个天然的假设是存在的：“所有问题都有标准答案，问题在设计上就是逻辑可解的”。但是习惯这套“逻辑“的人，在处理现实世界的问题时，往往会不自觉地将自己带入死胡同。\n我将这个方法论称之为逻辑关联，与之相对的即是事实关联，生活中不乏遇到这种思维陷阱：\n白菜 3 块钱一斤，15 块钱可以买五斤白菜\n你们工厂一个月可以生产 3000 个零件，那明天先给我 10 个吧\n这个项目比较急，上次排期的工时是一周，我再给你一倍的人，三天给我做出来\n有时候其实很难意识到这样的思考模式存在的问题，这也是《人月神话》里屡次提到的困境，可能上面的例子不太直观，代入下现实生活：\n生一个孩子需要 9 个月，生一对双胞胎需要 18 个月\n生一个孩子需要 9 个月，9 个妈妈是不是只要 1 个月？！\n专注解决问题的思维方式久了，就会慢慢开始只在乎逻辑关联，而忽略事实关联，就会开始期待一种“银弹”，说是缘木求鱼也不过如此。\n很多初级项目经理最常犯的错误就在这里，总是期待着任何事情都有一个进度条，这样就可以直观的反馈当前进展，自己要做的也就不过是按照排期表往下催进度。\n这种人最喜欢问的问题就是“你这个要多久才能做出来？”，行使着身为“管理者”的特权，却不承担应有的角色义务。\n项目经理这个角色，真正应该问的问题是“你还需要哪些其他的帮助可以提升你的速度？”。优秀的项目经理知道，项目进度不是靠完成了多少来判断，而是靠如何拥有足够的资源进行最大规模的试错。项目经理确保的应该是满足需求，成功交付，然而现实中 X-Y 本末倒置的现象非常普遍，即为了完成某个目标，制定了一些 KPI （关键绩效指标），最后完全忽视了原初的目标，而去追求后定的 KPI 。就像是前段时间北京环卫工人买新鲜白菜当厨余垃圾事件，政策目标是垃圾分类，管理者制定了每种垃圾必须的数量指标，然后只考察这个数量指标，下面执行的人就变了味，偏离初衷，最终酿成悲剧。\n再者，项目经理在向上汇报进度的同时，也在享受作为一个管理者的荣誉，以及成功后收割胜利果实。这使得执行层面的人本身就对这些只能汇报进度，却无法承担执行工作的人非常敌视。\n况且在软件开发这个对人依赖非常大的领域，管理起来更需要一定的水平积累。项目经理每天跟人打交道，要知道人是有感情的，绝对不是你给他输入 1+1 ，他就给你输出 2 。同一个功能点同一个人，由于其工作状态的差别，也会产生巨大的差异，如果主动积极做，可能只要 1 天，消极怠工的做，就无法预期了。这在传统行业是无法想象的，因为只要按规定的程序和规范来做，即使换一拨工人，也可以在同样的时间建造出来，建出来的房子的质量也不会相差太远。要知道，再烂的挖土机也能挖出一个大坑。\n执行时，对软件工程师来说，遇到问题，解决问题。但如果遇到的问题占用了比预期更多的时间，则是对自己能力和自信的打击。此时如果项目经理也不专业，硬推进度，工程师就会出现一些掩盖问题的行为。\n我总觉得，负责技术攻坚的人也去追进度就很可惜。悲剧的根源是管理能力和技巧的不足，如果真的想做到结果导向，需要的是目标的制定和拆解，工作计划的精确评估和执行，真实有效的复盘，信息同步与应对突发状况的能力，这些都对领导者有很高的要求，如果能力不足以管理结果，那大家就只能来管理过程，最终陷入恶性循环。\n参考\n工程师想要做管理？先改变你的思考方式\n从程序员到项目经理：为什么要当项目经理",

          "description": "先说情况（个人主观叙述）：骑自行车在一个路口右转，该路段仅有一条约 1.5 米宽的人行道（上有盲道、公交车站等设施，顶上有施工的脚架），我在机动车道最右侧行驶，被交警截停，以违反《中华人民共和国道路交通安全法》第五十七条规定为由，根据《中华人民共和国道路交通安全法》和《广东省道路交通安全条例》作出警告处罚。执法过程中我向执勤交警指出，在没有划定非机动车道的情况下，非机动车可以在机动车道最右侧行驶。执勤交警说在全国范围内，人行道均可以兼当非机动车道。当时赶着骑行，也不想为难交警（因为没罚款），就签名拿了罚单。\n回来之后越想越不对，查阅了相关条款，罗列如下：\n《中华人民共和国道路交通安全法》第三十六条：根据道路条件和通行需要，道路划分为机动车道、非机动车道和人行道的，机动车、非机动车、行人实行分道通行。没有划分机动车道、非机动车道和人行道的，机动车在道路中间通行，非机动车和行人在道路两侧通行。\n《中华人民共和国道路交通安全法》第五十七条：驾驶非机动车在道路上行驶应当遵守有关交通安全的规定。非机动车应当在非机动车道内行驶；在没有非机动车道的道路上，应当靠车行道的右侧行驶。\n《中华人民共和国道路交通安全法实施条例》第七十条：因非机动车道被占用无法在本车道内行驶的非机动车，可以在受阻的路段借用相邻的机动车道行驶，并在驶过被占用路段后迅速驶回非机动车道。机动车遇此情况应当减速让行。\n我觉得主要争议点如下：\n“非机动车未在非机动车道内行驶”：他的表述看起来没有问题，确实没在非机动车道行驶。但现场并无非机动车道，按规定可以在车行道右侧行驶，应该不适用于这条。\n“人行道可以兼当非机动车道”：同样按照《中华人民共和国道路交通安全法》第五十七条，非机动车也不应该在人行道行驶，交警这句话本身就是错的。另外，如果要按照这条执法，非机动车在机动车道行驶可能违法，在人行道行驶也可能违法，非机动车到底怎么开？\n另，这种情况是否可以向交警提起异议，撤销处罚？",

          "description": "2024 ，第 12 周，0318-0324\n如释重负的一周，放松了很多。\n\n极简日记 iOS\n这周终于提交了一个 TF ，主要是围绕导出导出功能做优化：\n修复了导出闪退\n导出时可以看到图片总数\n点击数据文件可以直接打开 App 进行导入\n直接将导出的数据文件直接放到 App 的文件夹内，并可以一键打开文件夹\n内存释放问题\n从上周开始，我就一直在处理导出数据时爆内存的问题。数据比较少的时候还好，但是数据一多，特别是图片内容比较多的情况下，导出时必然会出现因为内存不足而闪退。\n经过逐项方法的排查，最终确定问题就出现在读取图片数据上。我尝试了各种方法，减少 fetch limit ，加 autoreleasepool ，每次循环结束后清空数组，都不行。而且奇怪的是，即使退出导出页面了，被占用的内存也没有释放。\n后来在请教了肘子哥之后，肘子哥立刻看出了问题所在，一针见血，一句代码就解决了我的问题。原来我之前使用的是全局的 Environment 托管上下文，改成临时的上下文就 ok 了。\n这不是第一次肘子哥帮我解决 Core Data 方面的问题了，在此，赞美肘子哥！\nDebug view\n为了让用户帮我调试 App ，我写了个在非生产环境下才会出现的 debug view 。 正好 RevenueCat 也有一个 debug UI ，可以显示关于内购的相关信息，就也加进来了。Debug mode 下没有任何问题，但是 Release Mode 就无法编译，archive 也不行，找了半天原因，直到看到 RevenueCat 的文档里有这么一句：\nNote: The debug UI won't compile for release builds, so you'll need to disable the behavior before archiving for release.\n旁路由\n买了大电视后，就特别想在电视上看 Netflix 。\n最简单的方案应该是 Apple TV ，但是没舍得。前些天差点就买了一个软路由，但是看看价格还是舍不得。之前用 NAS 折腾过一次旁路由，失败了。又看了几个教程后发现我的 NAS 完全可以做旁路由，之前失败其实是搞错了方向。\n周日花了一下午和一晚上终于搞定了 Nas+OpenWrt 。期间遇到了 OpenWrt 可以联网，但是连到 openwrt 的手机无法联网的问题。装了两个不同版本的 openwrt 的镜像，各种瞎鼓捣，又是 opkg ，又是配置接口和防火墙，还特意花钱注册了一个论坛账号。\n搞定后发现，将电视的 IP 和 DNS 设置成旁路由还是比较麻烦，还不如直接用电脑或者手机投屏了……不过 OpenWrt 还是有很多可玩性的，有待以后慢慢探索了。\n认真减肥第三周\n本周体重变化不大，但是有新突破，突破了 190 斤，最低 189.7 斤。\n有两天的晚饭吃得比较晚，因为特别饿吃得还比较多，万幸没有涨称。\n健身+游泳\n这周只去了两次健身房，周二练背，周五练胸。\n泳池终于重新开放了，去年买的游泳三件套终于开封了，去游了 30 分钟。\n不服不行，年龄越大，身体恢复就越慢，健身后三天酸痛都没有丝毫减轻。\n杂事\n周五的时候清空了 Boss 给的任务列表，度过了一个轻松无压力的周末\n买了个 69.8 的联想夹耳式耳机，真是一分钱一分货啊，包装和做工都非常差，到手后试听了 1 小时果断退货了\n花了一下午折腾在本地用 act 执行 GitHub action ，失败\n继续上周的 SwiftData 学习，这周看完了 Stewart Lynch 的这个系列视频\n看完了网飞版的《三体》，没想到我的时间线上对这个剧评价的两极分化如此严重。我看过原著，也看过腾讯版，我个人倒是觉得网飞版还不错，可以打四星\n采用一种新的番茄工作法，写 25 分钟代码，玩一局 Brotato 😜",

          "description": "前言\n我的截图插件 js-web-screen-shot ，在三年的时间里，经历了从 1.0.0 到 1.9.9 的版本迭代。随着功能的不断增加，原本的入口文件变得越来越复杂和混乱，代码行数已接近 1500 行。\n最近，在着手开发 2.0 大版本的功能，面对这些复杂的代码，我感到非常困扰，这也使得很多想要为项目贡献新功能的人因为代码的复杂性而望而却步。\n经过综合考量后，我决定优化和拆分入口文件中的冗余部分，使结构更加简洁明了。本文就跟大家分享下我的优化过程，欢迎各位感兴趣的开发者阅读本文。\n逻辑梳理\n从入参开始，逐行分析代码，捋清函数间的依赖关系，这是我们首先要做的。我在做复杂的事情时，习惯把自己脑子里想的东西以思维导图的形式呈现出来，如下图所示，插件从实例化到加载，总共分为 9 个步骤：\n获取用户配置\n创建辅助 DOM （ webrtc 模式时需要用到）\n实例化全局响应式对象\n提取可选配置\n获取截图区域的 canvas 容器\n修改容器的可滚动状态\n加载截图组件\n调整容器层级\n创建事件监听\n这 9 个步骤中，加载截图组件是其核心处理逻辑，也是依赖关系最错综复杂的地方。此处就不做过多赘述了，感兴趣的开发者可以结合图中的路线去翻阅mian.ts文件中的**load 方法**。\n\n制定方案\n分析完 load 方法，以及与其关联的类内部的私有方法。它们都有 1 个共同点：\n在截图期间对类内部引用类型和基本类型数据的各种计算与修改\n那么，我们能做的就是把这些计算逻辑拆分成方法，独立出去，只关注输入于输出，这样就大大降低了代码的复杂度，使其更易维护。\n\n代码拆分\n我新建了两个 ts 文件，用来存放拆分出来的方法。\nLoadCoreComponents.ts 处理组件中的数据计算处理方法\nmouseDownCore.ts 处理鼠标的按下、移动、抬起事件\n考虑到 load 方法所依赖的方法…",

          "description": "自小性格比较内向，在所有念书的学校和同学里面，是最不爱讲话的那种人。\n但是自从经历了 2 次死亡与我擦肩而过之后，就是开始认真做真实的自己。\n自己热爱的话题就是叭叭叭一直说，不热爱的，或者说主流价值观认可的太多东西，对我来说都是以前我也没爱过，现在和以后更爱不动。\n一次是上学的时候，学校的 phd 回来与老师发生人命案件，原因是偷了 phd 人家呕心沥血的成果的论文署名次序不给他公平。\n因为这个人命案件，我全班同学趴教室地板上 2 小时，冰冷的瓷砖，颤抖的双腿，怦怦跳的心脏，5 米远处想去却不敢去的卫生间，因为害怕离开教室就在走廊上遭遇嫌疑犯。2 小时，真的觉得当时绝对会死，人生最后一天了，我的天老爷啊。后来实在忍不住，双腿打着哆嗦，大家轮流放哨去了卫生间。那 5 米感觉像 100km 那样长。\n另一次是毕业之后，差点去某个音乐节，结果因为太忙太累在家躺，然后那个音乐节，尼玛，大规模杀伤好多人，天呐，我要去了我也完蛋。毕竟是户外，谁会在意什么呢？气氛又如此放松。\n虽然从小也是好好念书，温温柔柔的乖宝宝，但是自从这 2 件事情之后，就觉得，要是那人生最后一天也就那样了，绝对觉得人生如此的不值得！\n从小也没喝酒过，没抽烟过，没学坏过，没打架过，没骂人过，没挂科过，没撒谎过，连和当时男朋友出去也都是乖乖说实话，虽然没管过我就是了。\n努力做一个符合人设的人，最后觉得完全是非常傻 x 的一生啊。苍天，那天要是人生最后一天了，救命，觉得太傻 x 太傻 x 了。\n被同学霸凌也没给家里人说过，想着没有揍一顿这人我要是就这么没有了，简直，白活一场！！\n不够尽兴！\n然后物理课，我最讨厌的狗物理课，就竟然没有挂科过，唯一次要挂科老师竟然给我弄到了 60 分。\n这种憋屈的人生啊，太憋屈了。\n然后就开启了，做真实自我之路了。\n代价就是要失去不少明明可以轻而易举获得的东西。然后对于物质的欲望很低，名牌之类的也没啥想法，当然本来也买不起。\n结果，好几次发现被人误解为富二代/官二代。\n这真是让我非常不爽！\n但凡被认为是不同阶层，大概就很难跟不同的人有所交集了吧！\n可是也是很志趣相投的人。不想轻易就这么被误解了呢。\n主要我真不是富二代官二代啊！\n我思考了一下\n我的行为\n一般来讲啊，都是赞美他人居多，然后不管对着谁，我都不会有那种特害怕的感觉，主要是真的觉得，妈呀，饶了我，老娘都是死过 2 次的人了，什么 pua 我都是无感了的。\n穿着打扮\n不穿任何有 logo 的衣服，背那种买菜的帆布袋子，或者什么商城打折的塑料袋子。土到我妈已经厌弃我的程度了已经。但是我觉得运动装好舒服啊，哈哈哈。\n说话\n我一般都不反驳的。主要是什么观点我都可以理解 ta 的想法。因为事物本来就是多维度立体的。\n我喜欢听人家讲。一般就安安静静的坐着听。\n车\n我也买不起新车啊。一个旧车家里人开着，我开车小心又注意规矩。插队我要骂脏话的！但是自从有一次爆血管之后，觉得简直了，真忍不了天天骂脏话高血压的感觉就，地铁或者公交，或者打车了。\n天天打车竟然也被误会成富二代官二代了，我的天。\n打车比买车便宜。因为没钱啊我的天~~\n真诚发问。\n以后如何做，以看起来不是官二代/富二代呢。\n太桑心了真的。\n真的憎恨这种认为划分人种的感觉，阻碍人与人的交流，绝了，这社会管理大法，真是厉害了。在每一个人的心中种下自我隔离的小小种子。",

          "description": "名字: Jingle Bio\n开发者 / 团队: Luo Baishun\n平台: Web\n请简要介绍下这款产品\nJingle Bio 是一款不需要任何编程基础就可以轻松驾驭的个人网站制作工具，你可以使用 Jingle Bio 来展示自己的作品、技能、经历、成就、爱好等，构建自己的个人品牌。\n\n哪个瞬间让你决定开发这款产品？\n创造 Jingle Bio 的初衷是：我的上一个产品 EarlyBird 在增长上遇到了一些瓶颈，因此我想要构建一个基于 EarlyBird 的子产品来推动 EarlyBird 的增长。 \n在经过几个 idea 的抉择之后，就决定选择耗时最短的 link in bio 赛道，当时我试用了市面上几乎所有 link in bio 工具，包括 Linktree、Bio Link、Beacons、Bento 等，它们各有各的优缺点，于是我决定把这些产品的优点集中到一个产品中来，这就是 Jingle Bio 的雏形。\n相比于同类产品，你觉得它有什么特别之处？\n相比较传统的 link in bio 工具，Jingle Bio 的特别之处在于它已经不仅仅只是链接的集合，而是十多种组件形式（链接卡片、社交媒体卡片、技能卡片、经历卡片、音视频、地图等）组合而成的多媒体名片。\n\n相比较 Bento ，Jingle Bio 不仅可以让用户使用自己的域名，还能够追踪页面中每个组件的表现，让用户可以清晰洞察受众在自己的个人网站关注了哪些内容。除此之外，Jingle Bio 还内置了邮件收集和支付集成，对于有粉丝量的 KOL 来说，提供了直接变现的通道。\n你尝试过哪些渠道推广它？过程中有什么收获吗？\n我们在圣诞节那天公开发布 Jingle Bio 到了 Product Hunt ，并拿到了 #2 Product of the Day，这给我们带来了一个小小的 traction 。 \n随后，我们又提交 Jingle Bio 到了各大目录站，带来了另外一些直接的流量和曝光。 \n我日常会活跃在 Twitter ，会把 pitch 给我认为适合使用 Jingle Bio 来构建个人品牌的推友。 \n长期的计划当然还是 SEO ，目前 Jingle Bio 的 DR 已经来到 25 ，也开始有了自然的搜索流量，未来还将持续投入资金和时间到 SEO 上。\n发布这款产品至今，有哪些反馈让你印象深刻？\n最直接的还是用户觉得 Jingle Bio 抄袭了 Bento ，我对此倒是没有什么要反驳的，但 Jingle Bio 和 Bento 的差异挺多的，受众人群也不完全一样。 \n好的一面是，很多用户制作了在我预期之外的 use case ，比如形式主义文档生成器、旅馆主页、产品的 changelog 等等，这也帮助我开拓了视野，更好地理解 Jingle Bio 可以帮助什么样的人实现品牌价值。\n有哪些产品你觉得应该被更多用户知道？\n哈哈哈我可以说我的上一个产品 EarlyBird 吗？因为验证想法这件事真的太需要被推广了，在我们的社区里，有太多的独立开发者闷着头做产品，到头来发现没有用户对自己的产品感兴趣，所以 EarlyBird 就是以一个方法论来告诉用户：你的 idea 可能很值钱，但没有经过验证的 idea 一文不值。\n在产品出海的路上，你学到最重要的一棵是什么？\n重营销轻技术。不是说技术不重要，而是在产品早期的时候，技术的重要性远不如营销，这其实是无数 indie hacker （也包括我自己）在经历了惨痛教训之后达成的共识。把 80% 的时间用在营销，而把 20% 的时间用在开发，先让产品被更多的人知道，品牌被更多的人记住，才有机会获得足够多的用户反馈，进而推动后续产品的开发。\n介绍一下你自己，以来未来的计划。\n我是一个草根创业者，一个 dadpreneur ，业余时间做做独立开发，已经上线的作品有 Jingle Bio 、EarlyBird、HeyForm、TinySnap 等，同时我还是目前国内最大的独立开发者出海社区「出海去」的联合创始人。 \n关于未来，我会在保持自己独立开发者身份的同时，更多地去投资和孵化一些有热情、有冲劲、有想法的独立开发者，帮助他们快速成长。\n关于 Apptisan\nApptisan 是 Application 与 Artisan 的组合词，意为「与应用背后的工匠交流」。\n每一期我会与来自不同地方的创作者交流，希望通过我们的对话来向更多的用户介绍有趣的产品。\n如果你倾向于英文阅读，欢迎通过 Substack 订阅。如果你想要自荐产品，请填写该 表格，我会尽快与你取得联系。",

          "description": "转\n3 月 13 日，人工智能初创公司 Cognition AI 发布首个 AI 工具「 Devin 」。该 AI 号称掌握编程工作的全栈技能，可以独立完成整个项目的软件开发。相比曾经辅助程序员编码的 AI 工具「 Copilot 」，Devin 具有独立驾驭整个编程项目的能力，更接近一个人类程序员。\nPerplexity CEO 评价 Devin ，称它所展示的 Demo 意味着业内第一个真正的 Agent 诞生。言下之意是这个产品开始具备推理和规划能力。Devin 目前只提供私人预览版，尚未向公众开放。\n如何使用 Devin 以及它表现如何？\n作为一个软件开发工具，Devin 号称能够在接收到具体任务指令后，自主完成整个项目的开发。目前，Devin 不仅会构建和部署端到端的应用程序、自行查找并修复代码库错误，还可以训练和微调 AI 模型，并修复开源代码库中的错误。\n与人类软件开发者的工作方式相似，用户只需要通过聊天对话框提出需求，Devin 便能够基于需求规划出解决方案，并运用其集成的开发工具，编写代码、定位并修复漏洞、执行测试，同时实时向用户报告项目进展。例如，在收到建立一个展示某区域全部餐馆的网站任务时，Devin 可以自动搜索和收集数据，随后构建并上线该网站。\nf46f483d6f504deaa79849038780023a_1080x57\n在 SWE 基准测试中，Devin 能够端到端地正确解决 13.86%的案例，相比之下，Claude 2 和 GPT-4 分别只能处理 4.80%和 1.74%的问题。SWE 测试使用来自现实世界开源项目的 GitHub 问题来挑战人工智能助手。\n其他 AI 工具只能辅助编码，Devi 的突破在于可以自动完成整个项目\nAI 技术在软件开发行业已非初见，多种工具如 GitHub Copilot 、StarCoder 以及在 Hugging Face 上拥有若干小型 AI 编码模型的 Replit ，以及最近获得 6500 万美元 B 轮融资的 Codeium 等早已广泛应用。这些工具主要侧重于 AI 辅助编码，它们的功能局限于提供编码建议、生成基本代码或帮助解决特定编程问题。\nDevin 则更类似一个 AI 软件工程师，可以独立承担和完成整个软件开发项目。不过，同样依赖于训练数据来学习的 Devin 在理解和解决特别复杂或非标准化问题上能力有限，比如对于一些少见的问题，它可能无法找到最优解决方案，也无法完全模拟人类软件工程师的创造性思维。\nCognition AI 由 Scott Wu 、Steven Hao 、WaldenYan 联合创立，都是 IOI 金牌得主\nScott Wu：联合创始人兼 CEO （首席执行官），毕业于哈佛大学，曾获得过美国三届奥赛金牌，并曾是 Lunchclub 的联合创始人兼 CTO ，为 2012 年至 2014 年连续 3 年的 IOI （ International Olympiad in Informatics ，国际信息学奥林匹克竞赛）金奖得主，IOI 是面向中学生的信息学科竞赛，一年举行一次。\nSteven Hao：联合创始人兼 CTO （首席技术官），毕业于 MIT 计算机专业，之前曾在 Scale AI 、Jane Street 、DE Shaw 、Quora 工作，为 2014 年第 32 届 IOI 金牌得主；\nWaldenYan：联合创始人兼 CPO （首席产品官），毕业于哈佛大学计算机科学和经济学相关专业，曾从事 MIT PRIMES 密码学和机器学习方向的计算机科学研究，为 2020 年第 32 届 IOI 金牌得主。\nCognition AI 成立时间不足两个月，专注解决人工智能的推理问题\nCognition AI 没有透露产品细节，也没有透露 Devin 构建在什么样的模型上，是自研还是基于 GPT 之类的第三方模型。不过，Cognition 称这项工作是其「长期推理和规划方面的进步」的结果。基于推理和规划能力，Cognition 表示「编码只是开始」，未来，该公司还将在其他垂直行业开发类似的 AI 工具。\nCognition AI 公司总共 10 人，目前没有固定办公室——他们散落在硅谷和纽约之间的 Airbnb 以及家庭办公室中工作。虽然成立时间不长，但该公司已获得 2100 万美元 A 轮融资，投资者包括 Founders Fund 和 Twitter （现「 X 」）前高管 Elad Gil 等。\n参考链接：\nhttps://www.cognition-labs.com/blog",

          "description": "之前一在使用 win11 的手机连接，可以把手机上的通知和短信同步到电脑的通知中心，对一打开电脑就懒得拿手机的我来说简直太方便了。\n这几天在折腾 archlinux, 在 linux 上有一个非常强大的工具 kde connect, 功能上和手机连接类似，通过局域网传输信息。\n但是\n使用的校园网开了 ip 隔离，同一个局域网下的俩设备互相扫描不到，这就很别扭。win 的手机连接背靠围绕的服务器，可以通过微软来传输数据，但 kde connect 就不行了啊。\n当时想到的别的解决方法就是手机开热点让电脑连或者电脑开热点让手机连。但是手机长时间开热点会发热，linux 笔记本我一直没找到像 win11 那样又连 wifi 又开热点的方法，所以也不行\n直到在升级我的 kde 桌面到 6.0.1 之前，我从 kde 官网的宣传文里看到了这么一句\n“KDE Connect can now connect to other devices via Bluetooth”\n很兴奋啊，蓝牙连接对我来说确实是个完美的解决方法，\n手机电脑分别装上 kde connect 客户端之后，发现不太对，这和之前啥区别都没有啊，咋也找不到蓝牙相关的设置项。上网查了查，发现相关的特性确实还没开放。\n不太死心，也不想干巴巴等着，“kde connect” “blueteetch”这俩关键词反复搜了好几遍，找到了这么个帖子\nhttps://discuss.kde.org/t/using-kde-connect-with-bluetooth-to-my-android-phone/8664\n以外之喜，说实话我之前对蓝牙的认识仅仅是蓝牙耳机，隐隐约约也有个可以共享网络的印象，没想到可以做成给 kde connect 这类通过局域网传输内容的蓝牙网络\n思路打开了，win 平台也完全可以这么折腾，大文件除外的内容局域网内容传输都可以用蓝牙网络",

          "description": "这几天 在 V2EX 看到 WSA 即将停止支持 的消息，令人惊讶，却也是必然的结局。\n没什么时间写，完整的文章在 本人博客 ，感兴趣的可以看看，这里只贴一些关键内容。\n模拟器这类软件，无论是在哪个领域总会存在。但是 Android 模拟器的特殊性在于，它将原本针对开发者的工具，提供给了普通的终端消费者。\nWSA 很容易令人联想到 WSL2 。与 WSL2 类似的技术，让很多开发者和技术型用户对它寄予厚望。\nWSA 与 WSL2 一样使用 Hyper-V ，属于 Type 0 Hypervisor ，在 CPU 性能和 GPU 性能都有优势。微软在 WSA 上倾注了大量的精力，改进他的易用性，性能以及与 Windows 的互操作。\n但是与 WSL2 的巨大成功不同，WSA 面临的问题显然要更多，更复杂。消费者不关心技术细节，微软花大力器移植高版本全功能 Android ，完全卷不过把精力放在花里胡哨、投机取巧功能上的国产模拟器厂商。\n如果只实现基本功能，那么对消费者实用性不大，虽然很常见于国产操作系统（主要是桌面 linux ）的“完美兼容安卓和 windows 应用！”噱头。但 2-8 定律和现实情况告诉我们，真的要让普通用户对 WSA 整体满意，还面临着很多挑战。\n兼容性，转译与性能损失：曾经 x86 比 ARM 快很多，性能损失还算可以接受，但是随着移动端芯片性能的发展，差距在不断缩小。再加上 高刷新率的普及，桌面端硬件不再像之前那样游刃有余 ，此外还有图形性能，新 API ，Vulkan 等问题\n移动化趋势：无论是国内还是国外，现在许多网民已经只持有移动终端设备，没有桌面端设备。WSA 与其说是拥抱 Android ，从令一个角度看，不如说是与移动端对抗。\n风控与可信计算：微信等国产应用，Facebook 等境外应用都有比较严格的风控，很多时候甚至不允许同账号同时登陆。许多厂商默认 x86 就是有问题的，就是工作室，直接拉高风控等级。而国内厂商在风控对抗上显然有更丰富经验，国产的模拟器很多都用于灰色，甚至黑色用途，他们有足够的资金来源和稳定盈利方式，而 WSA 没有，WSA 从一开始就不是一个面向生产的，可以盈利的技术，而是试图做到通用，却吃力不讨好的，给尝鲜用户的玩具。\n总体比较悲观，算瞎扯。其实这篇文章很早就想写，但是也不马后炮了，随便说两句。\n我认为给消费者使用的类似需求的产品中，Pad 和投屏会成为趋势。长期来看，无论是消费者还是针对开发人员，对模拟器的需求都会趋向于减少，向真机调试迁移，甚至真机都要锁定测载，只允许使用厂商提供的调试设备。模拟器最终可能只提供给核心的系统开发人员。",

          "description": "1. 前言\n关于 web 远程调试，最近看到货拉拉的前端团队在这个领域上持续发力，开源了 PageSpy 项目，同时也发表了文章阐述了远程调试的使用场景，解决了很多痛点问题。\n那这里我将介绍另外一种 web 远程调试的实现方案：devtools-remote-debugger\n项目地址：https://github.com/Nice-PLQ/devtools-remote-debugger\n先来看下远程调试的效果\n为了方便演示，用单独窗口来模拟，动态图片比较大，可能需要点加载时间\n\n2. 介绍\nChrome Devtools 是前端几乎每天都需要用到的开发调试工具，其功能强大，易用，使用场景多种多样，包括但不限于 node 、小程序开发等。devtools 本身是开源的前端项目，很容易构建并集成，并与 Chrome DevTools Protocol(简称 CDP)协议进行对接。然后再通过 Javascript 按 CDP 的规范实现其协议，就可以实现远程调试 Web 的能力。\n简单来说，实现远程调试需要具备三个条件：\n通过原生 Javascript 实现CDP的协议规范，构建出 sdk.js(文件名称任意)，并在被调试页面中加载该 js\n构建出 Chrome Devtools 前端产物，并部署为web页面\n实现websocket协议转发\nChrome Devtools 与目标页面之间的协议交互是用 websocket 来通信的。通过实现一个 websocket 转发的中间服务层，其作用是将 devtools 的协议消息转发给目标页面处理，或将目标页面的协议消息转发给 devtools 处理。大概的示意图如下\n\n如何使用远程调试\n根据项目 README 说明构建出sdk.js代码，该 SDK 是CDP的协议实现。然后在需要调试的 Web 项目 HTML 中加载该文件\nnpm run start部署远程调试后端 Node 服务\n建立连接后，在调试管理端打开 Chrome Devtools 开发者工具来调试目标页面\n目前来说，已实现的功能如下，基本上能够覆盖常用的调试能力，同时也扩展了调试协议，实现了页面实时预览能力。\n1 、调试管理端\n展示当前可调试的页面信息\n\n2 、Element\nHTML 实时查看、属性编辑\nStyle 、Computed 样式预览\nhover 元素高亮\n元素审查\nScreencast\n\n\n3 、Console\nJS 代码执行\nJS 运行时错误堆栈预览\nDOM 元素片段\n查看 console.log/warn 调用堆栈\n\n4 、Source\nJS 运行时错误代码文件定位及索引\n查看 HTML 、JS 、CSS 源文件代码\n源代码格式化预览\n\n5 、Network\n异步请求抓包（ Fetch 、XHR ）\nHTML 、JS 、CSS 、图片等静态资源请求抓包\n\n6 、Application\nLocal Storage\nSession Storage\nCookies\n\n7 、ScreenPreview （扩展协议）\n页面实时预览\n\n更多信息请参阅项目说明，https://github.com/Nice-PLQ/devtools-remote-debugger",

          "description": "年后简历投了一段时间了，上周把 APP 里的期望薪资下调到下限 30k 才陆续有一些面试（在此之前根本约不到面试），工作日安排起来基本是一到两天排一家面试，但是有面试的都是那些岗位薪资范围里上限是 30k 的的岗位。\n薪资高的岗位，投递的人很多，招聘方可以很轻松地把门槛设置成 211 及以上或者有大厂背景。\n离家近且薪资稍微可以接受的（就是 1~4 公里范围内可以直接骑电瓶车上班的那种，薪资 25k 的），感觉又嫌弃我非计算机相关专业，面试机会也拿不到。\n怎么样才能让自己有比较高的技术护城河呢？我的意思是一来不容易被旧公司裁，二来很容易找到新公司。\n什么全栈，或者说熟悉源码、八股文啥的，都不会让人感觉安全。我觉得开发走到有架构思维/大局观判断就走到头了。比如说张三没看过 babel 源码，但是知道 babel 用了其他库可以将 JS 代码生成对应的抽象语法树，然后当他想做条件编译的时候，知道可以用这个库来帮忙做判断（或者不知道然后强写正则判断），我感觉已经够可以了。再比如说，李四知道 google chrome 官方出了个 npm 包叫 web-vitals ，可以用于检测页面性能数据，那为啥还要知道浏览器的 performance.timing 和那个啥 getEntries 这种 API ，然后一堆属性减来减去自己算呢，调用一个 7 层高阶函数比调用一个 8 层高阶函数显得更底层有优越性吗？再再比如想开发一个开发环境下使用的构建系统，不喜欢硬盘里出现临时生成的文件，然后因为用过 webpack 类的，知道这是可以实现的，然后看了个屁的源码（看了 webpack-dev-server 项目的 package.json ）知道有个叫 memfs 的包可以在内存里模拟文件系统，那不就可以完事告急了吗，然后面试你问我看过源码没我和你说我看了个 package.json ？再再再比如，没弄过 JS 和 wasm 的交互那就不会了吗，那不就是几个 api 的事情吗。还有面试问 webpack loader 或者 plugin 怎么写的，或者 vite 的什么钩子的，感觉好捉急啊，这些 api 、钩子有什么好问的，你只要知道主流的构建工具肯定你想要的时间点的钩子都会给你的，你只要需要的时候翻文档对一下哪个钩子适合塞入你的脚本逻辑就好了，你的主要时间不是找钩子，是在钩子里写你的脚本啊亲（大部分都是读下内容然后改改内容）。突然想起来刚转行的时候碰到过问 jQuery 上用什么 api 去挂自定义函数的，或者后面类似的 vue 上怎么挂的。会抄就很强了，就像学生时代抄数学题答案交差，带着脑子抄就好了。又不是所有人都喜欢去大厂当螺丝钉的。\n感觉建筑专业的、擅长 webgl 的程序员应该在建筑细分行业里会符合我说的这种情况。\n那药学专业的程序员，去做生物分析是不是一个合适的路子，有过来人可以说说吗，最好是做生信这块的。\n我自己调研了下，家边上有不少这方面的工作岗位。有些薪资低的接受本科学历，除了个别经理岗位会需要博士学历外，主体目标人群的学历是硕士，感觉入行门槛没有特别高（对于有经验的员工，学历和专业限制比较松）。而且根据我自己调研的情况，生信似乎不太依赖硬件实验设备，所以感觉挺适合自学转进去的。计算机+非计算机双背景的感觉入行后的门槛高度会让人感觉有比较大的安全感。\n帖子不是按顺序写的，最长的那段是最后写的，写得我有点愤青了。轻喷。",

          "description": "我父亲是一个没什么主见的人，他经常和一位同村的长辈聊天。这个长辈挺成功的，在县城里做过小官。他帮我奶奶办过一个教师保险(我奶奶不是教师)，领退休金，大概总共领了十几二十万，算对我们家有恩。我奶奶在这个长辈被抓的时候借钱给他，后来他出来了。\n我父亲有啥话都和他说。这个长辈说话建议啥的对我很不客气，并且很会煽动人的情绪。我父亲被他影响很大。我也和他聊过几次。他说过：1. 找个老婆有那么难吗？！我现在随时都可以约一个出来你信吗？他 60 多了 2. 你平时要主动点，大胆点，不要怕羞。3. 你多约约人家出来！别人要求很高吗？！难道她要香港的？！（男朋友）我说：有可能哦。4. 不是人家不好，多想想自己的原因，多练练口才。是你沟女不行，是你自己不够优秀！别人怎么能找到，比你差的都有人找两三个老婆。\n我父亲会对我说，xx 伯说你在北京那么远，有可能会嫁出去啵。回广东吧！（讽刺我会给别人当上门女婿）。\n我爸这个人内向，口才不好，情商特别低，但脾气特别暴躁。特别是对爷爷，对奶奶。奶奶特别强势压制父亲特别厉害，父亲是独子，看得出来奶奶很爱父亲，父亲也很爱奶奶，同时父亲也恨奶奶，她太强势了。爷爷年轻的时候不怎么管家里，爷爷以前当兵的在县城有单位。奶奶一个人在家带 4 个孩子，爷爷不怎么管。\n父亲的工作很辛苦，做大理石的。23 年一线工人，也修点电路，电动机。大理石要切割（粉尘特别多），噪音，搬动。哎～ 20 多年干苦力活太辛苦了\n我父亲他特别好面子，他以为他在村里形象挺好的，别人都挺尊敬他。其实他的形象挺差的。有一次父亲去赌，我母亲在家哭，母亲也是挺犟脾气的，在家越想越憋屈（父亲每次赌母亲就说自己的辛苦钱去送给别人），在生闷气。后来忍不了直接去摔麻将。过年期间全村人都知道了。\n后来我分析，为什么父亲过年会想去赌。他其实挺孤独的挺苦的，经常 11 点半多,12 点才睡，他焦虑孤独睡不着阿。平时没什么朋友聊天。好不容易过年，儿时的玩伴都回来了，当然要去玩了，放松一下，和别人聊聊天，社交一下。重要的是别人会说好听的话，他会想听到他想听的话。毕竟财神爷送钱谁不喜欢。还有有些别人讽刺他的话他也听不懂以为别人夸他呢。还挺开心的。\n有一次我父亲去喝完别人喜酒。别人说：一哥张家就差你一个了啵，儿子啥时候结婚阿？你儿子有没有聊女朋友？再不结婚就迟了哟！我父亲听了这些话就很慌，是天塌下来的那种。他最听不了这些话，每次慌了就打电话过来训我，怪我没用给他丢脸。村里有的人会故意刺激他，他都是照单全收，他每次都焦虑得要死，就打电话训我。训得多了，他说：和我说话你老是嗯嗯嗯的，会不会说话！你和女孩子也是这样说话的是吧！那把嘴能不能学好点得不得！学精明点得不得！整天脑子里面是什么！装的是水吗！整天没精神的样子学阳光点会死阿！整个番薯一样！你有脑的吗！（以前语气都是像喊贼那么大声）。你那双眼看上天，眼睛长在头顶！别那么清高得不得！别人一层楼的都取了二，三个了！\n以前他说到难听的话我忍着，不和他争辩，毕竟他是父亲。后来我回击了，是狠狠的回击了。他骂我：脑子是不是有问题！你是男人吗！有卵蛋吗！你那方面是不是有问题！有空去医院看看吧！我回应也很激烈！那一次我们歇斯底里！\n后来我们很久没有说话。前不久我们又大吵一架，歇斯底里的那种！\n在我的世界观里，对于讽刺自己的人（例如亲戚），占自己便宜的人（例如同事叫帮带早餐不给钱），同属岗位的同事挖坑。这些人 1.：远离。2.：警戒不要太给面子。3.敌人。现在选项 1 行不通。不是选项 3 毕竟是父亲。现在是选项 2 ，不给面子，能过过不过拉到，少接触，少聊天，有事帮，无事不接触。过年回家聚聚，能好好说话就聊。以前我老实在了，心想他是父亲要尊重他让他讲话，傻傻的听他训话，结果他越训越起劲，越难听，侮辱人。现在如果说话风向不对赶紧逃离，找借口挂电话。老了养他。\n最后想听听大家的建议。以后我该怎么办，怎么和父亲相处",

          "description": "这里有一些我对于 samba 的一些不满，简单概括就是文件路径太长 samba 不支持，导致文件名可用字符很短。结论下来 SMB 服务器还是得 Windows 。\nWindows 下有存储空间，但是这个东西风评不是很好，文档也不全。隔壁 LTT 也抛弃了使用这东西来组磁盘阵列。\n于是，先大概列出组磁盘阵列要有的功能：\n一定程度内，硬盘故障不会导致数据丢失\n允许添加任意大小的磁盘进行扩容\n冗余级别可以自行选择\n然后就发现了 SnapRAID 。一个跨平台的文件“备份”方案。使用效果和 Unraid 类似，不是传统的 RAID ，但是也能提供一定程度冗余。\nSnapRAID 运行在文件系统之后，而不是组了 RAID 之后再运行文件系统。于是这东西就能跨平台。\n目前打算是这样整：\nPVE -> Windows Server -> SnapRAID -> DrivePool -> SSD Cache -> SMB\n\nDrivePool 可以替换成 RClone Union + WinFSP ，但是这样估计太怪了。\n然后就是 SSD 缓冲的设计，可以是只缓冲 SMB 写，也可以是缓存每个硬盘。估计 PrimoCache 可以完成。\nOVM 是有 SnapRAID 插件，配合 MergerFS 就能实现以上功能。但是我不要 Samba ，或者 OVM 开 NFS 然后 Windows 提供 SMB ？\n最后就是 SnapRAID 的配置\n校验数据和 Unraid 一样，校验数据的硬盘必须是最大容量的硬盘。校验数据是普通的文件，于是允许校验盘是多个硬盘组成，但是实际上使用会不会有问题。\nSnapRAID 需要手动同步。虽然跑一次影响不大，但也是要手动（或定时，或事件触发）跑一次。\n关于大量小文件的友好程度。\n想听听 dalao 们有什么看法。",

          "description": "概念\n首先给出一段由 ChatGPT 给出的简短的 AOP 概念：\nAOP 是一种编程方法，用来将在程序中多处重复出现的代码（比如日志、权限控制）从主要业务逻辑中抽取出来，提高代码的模块化和可维护性。\n抽取后的代码会在原始的业务逻辑代码中特定的位置执行，这些位置由切点（ Pointcut ）定义。通常会在方法执行前、执行后、抛出异常时等特定点执行抽取出的代码，这些点被称为连接点（ Join Point ）。\n概述\n在 C 语言中，编译器所提供的编译期和执行期的能力相较于 java 或者其他语言来说会弱一些，这也许就是可能很少听到在 C 语言中搞面向切面编程的原因之一吧。\n从上面的概念上来看，AOP 一般是在一些函数（或类方法）执行前后做一些额外处理，例如调用前增加一些权限控制，调用后增加一些日志记录。从这些行为上来说，任何语言其实都可以做到。我们可以简单的在一个函数的开始加一段逻辑或调用某个函数来实现权限验证，在函数返回前调用某个函数添加日志等等。类似如下代码：\nvoid foo(void)\n{\n  if (!verify_identity())\n    return;\n\n  //...\n  \n  log(\"end\");\n}\n\n但很显然，这么做会在程序的很多个函数中添加很多重复的代码（例如本例的verify_identity和log），以至于代码变得比较臃肿。\n那么有没有什么办法来瘦身呢？\n这就是 AOP 擅长的领域了。\n写在示例之前\nC 语言编译器没有提供很完整的 AOP 支持，因此我们需要自行手动实现，或者使用一些现有的库来实现。\n本文将使用开源 C 语言库 Melon 的函数模板来实现上面的效果。\n在 Melon 提供的函数模板组件中，实现了若干宏函数，这些宏函数都是用来定义不同类型的函数的。这些用宏来定义的函数和我们原生 C 语言中的函数的区别，简单来说就是，在我们…",

          "description": "当地时间周一(4月1日)，人工智能(AI)公司OpenAI宣布，将允许用户直接使用ChatGPT，而无需注册该项服务，这将让人们更加容易体验人工智能的潜力。\n\r\n\r\nOpenAI表示，它将从周一开始逐步推出这一功能，让185个国家和地区的超1亿用户使用ChatGPT来学习新事物、寻找创意灵感，并获得问题的答案。2022年底，OpenAI正式发布了人工智能聊天机器人ChatGPT，随后在全世界掀起了人工智能狂潮，它可以模仿人类对话，并执行诸如创建长文本摘要、写诗甚至为主题派对生成创意等任务。\n\r\n\r\n据数据分析公司Similarweb称，自2023年5月ChatGPT全球总访问量达到18亿次的峰值以来，这一受欢迎服务的流量增长开始放缓。\n\r\n\r\n这应该也是OpenAI放开限制的原因，随着人工智能技术的发展，现有的互联网信息量可能不足以支撑科技巨头训练更先进的人工智能系统，甚至高质量文本数据的不足可能减缓人工智能技术的发展速度。\n\r\n\r\nOpenAI还表示，它已为无需注册即可访问ChatGPT的用户引入了额外的内容保护措施，例如阻止更广泛范围的类别中的提示和生成。但并未具体说明这些类别。\n\r\n\r\n除了ChatGPT的免费版本(即ChatGPT3.5)，OpenAI还将继续为个人、团队用户和企业提供付费版本。\n\r\n\r\n该公司还声称，它可能会使用用户提供的内容来帮助改进其大语言模型，但用户可以关闭此功能。\n\r\n\r\n虽然之后用户无需注册即可使用ChatGPT，不过，OpenAI还是建议用户注册一个账户。因为创建帐户有很多好处，包括保存和查看聊天记录、共享聊天记录，以及解锁语音对话和自定义说明等附加功能。\n\r\n\r\n与此同时，OpenAI推出了一种新的人工智能工具Voice Engine，通过输入文本和15秒音频样本，Voice Engine便可以生成一个与音频中说话者非常相似的自然语音，而生成的自然语音具有丰富的情感和逼真的声音。\n\r\n\r\n近日，据证券时报援引科技媒体The Information消息，微软和OpenAI正在规划建设一个雄心勃勃的数据中心项目，该项目可能耗资高达1000亿美元，折合人民币约7200亿元。其中包括一台名为“星际门”的人工智能超级计算机，该计算机将配备数百万个专用服务器芯片，旨在为OpenAI的AI技术提供强大动力。\n\r\n\r\n据悉，上述数据中心项目的成本，是目前一些最大数据中心项目的100倍，微软将承担项目的资金投入，展现了其对推动AI技术发展的坚定信心。整个数据中心项目分为五个阶段，目前正处于第三阶段，后两个阶段的重要节点分别为2026年和2028年。\n\r\n\r\n在微软和OpenAI的算力开发第四、第五阶段，都会有一台标志性的超算。其中第四阶段的超级计算机预期将在2026年投入使用，而第五阶段的超级计算机已经有了一个酷炫的代号——星际门（Stargate），微软高层希望最快能够在2028年推出这款超算。这也将是微软未来六年规划建设的一系列超算中规格最高的一个。\n\r\n\r\n另外，据媒体报道，OpenAI的“下一次重大更新”会在明年初推出。在今年初比尔·盖茨对话奥尔特曼的节目中，OpenAI首席执行官明确表示GPT-5的开发正在进行中。此前也有报道称，GPT-5的发布时间会是今年年中，同时OpenAI已经向一些企业用户提供了早期版本的预览。\n\r\n\r\n来源：每日经济新闻综合OpenAI、证券时报",

          "description": "近日，成都市新都区的一份初三语文试卷引发了社会广泛关注。该试卷中出现了一篇被指涉嫌美化侵华日军和侮辱八路军的文章——《杜鹃花落》。3月25日晚，成都市新都区通报称新都区已成立联合调查组进行全面调查，对相关教研员及区教科院院长予以停职。3月26日，河南省安阳市汤阴县教育局发布通告回应，该文作者已被免职。\n\r\n\r\n有资料称，李佳前是河南汤阴县的一所中学的校长，《杜鹃花落》这篇文章是于去年撰写并发表在网上的。这篇小小说以侵华日军的视角展开，主角岗田大佐是侵华日军的一份子，他的儿子本是日本帝国大学高材生，为了看望父亲来到中国，但在赶赴和父亲团聚的途中被八路军劫走，岗田为报仇而率军扫荡，把一股八路军尽数屠戮之后才发现，八路军一直在尽全力保护自己儿子，反而是自己的报复杀死了儿子。\n\r\n\r\n3月26日深夜，胡锡进在微博平台上发表了一篇近千字的长文，这篇文章针对“成都‘毒试卷’”事件发表了他个人的看法。\n\r\n\r\n胡锡进首先表示：他认可网友们对《杜鹃花落》这篇文章以及“成都‘毒试卷’”事件的愤怒，他觉得“这种愤怒是朴素的，（是）有道理的”，“即使（《杜鹃花落》的）作者有探索新写法的用意，（但）他的这种写法也无法被普通读者（所）理解，因而，（会令众多读者感到不舒服）。”他觉得，他无法确定这名作者的真实用意，很难相信那些初三学生能够理解那些意涵。\n\r\n\r\n接下来，胡锡进认为：无论是对那名已被免职校长（指《杜鹃花落》的作者李佳前）的调查以及对“毒试卷”的调查，都要坚持客观性，要听涉事人员的陈述，在当前的社会环境下，《杜鹃花落》的作者李佳前是不会故意去挑衅社会强大的共识的，是不会拿鸡蛋往石头上撞的。基于此，应该允许《杜鹃花落》的作者李佳前以及“成都‘毒试卷’”的当事人进行申辩。\n\r\n\r\n再接下来，胡锡进认为：小说《杜鹃花落》里面的基本情节不但没有侮辱八路军，而且，还有意突出了八路军的英勇，多数人是被…",

          "description": "当地时间3月17日，特斯拉CEO埃隆·马斯克旗下的人工智能初创公司xAI正式宣布开源大模型Grok-1，遵循Apache 2.0协议开放模型权重和架构。官网显示，xAI已经将Grok-1的权重和架构在软件托管平台GitHub上开源。\n\r\n\r\n官网介绍，Grok-1是3140亿参数的混合专家模型，是“迄今为止全球参数量最大的开源大语言模型”。相比之下，公开资料显示，OpenAI GPT-3.5的参数量为1750亿，Grok-1大幅领先。\n\r\n\r\n马斯克此举可谓说到做到。3月11日，马斯克就曾在社交平台表示xAI将开放聊天机器人Grok的源代码，这意味着公众将可免费使用该公司大模型技术背后的代码，Meta的CEO扎克伯格也在社交平台上发表评论表示支持。\n\r\n\r\n在社交媒体上，网友开玩笑称，xAI才是真正的“Openai”。\n\r\n\r\n马斯克向来支持开源技术，在开源的情况下，创造者向用户提供免费使用许可，有时还允许用户修改他们创造的成果。特斯拉已经开放了其汽车部件的源代码，马斯克的社交媒体平台X则公布了一些其用来对内容进行排序的算法。\n\r\n\r\n其实，马斯克与CEO山姆·奥特曼带领下的OpenAI在人工智能军备竞赛中积怨已久。\n\r\n\r\n马斯克曾是OpenAI的早期资助者和联合创始人，由于与奥特曼就AI安全意见不一，2018年马斯克已经离开OpenAI，他也成了OpenAI最高调的批评者之一。\n\r\n\r\n当地时间2月29日，马斯克刚对OpenAI、奥特曼，以及另一位创始人Greg Brockman提起诉讼，称该公司违背了最初对开源、非营利AI的承诺。在诉讼中，马斯克要求OpenAI恢复开源。\n\r\n\r\nOpenAI也马上对此做出回应。据外媒报道，OpenAI在向旧金山法院提交的法庭文件中表示，与马斯克从未就非营利和不公开源代码达成过创始协议，马斯克捏造所谓的创始协议，作为旨在“促进自己的商业利益”的诉讼的基础。\n\r\n\r\nxAI正式宣布开源大模型Grok-1的当天，马斯克还与ChatGPT在X平台上过招称“告诉我们OpenAI到底open（开源）在哪里了”。\n\r\n\r\n而马斯克旗下的xAI从去年7月份刚成立时，就被称作“OpenAI对手”。据悉，xAI的宗旨是“了解宇宙的真实本质”。\n\r\n\r\n去年11月4日， xAI团队发布了首个AI大模型产品Grok。据官网，作为聊天机器人，Grok能够和ChatGPT一样通过联网来获取实时信息，并浏览和使用X（原推特）平台上的信息。“Grok”一词原是科幻小说《异乡异客》中的一个火星术语，指对某事有非常深刻的同理心或直觉、能充分理解的一种状态。不过，官网同时也提醒用户，相较于其他聊天类机器人，Grok的特点是会用幽默反叛的方式来回答一些被其他AI系统拒绝回答的争议性问题。\n\r\n\r\n驱动Grok的引擎是Grok-1，是xAI团队在过去4个月内运用前沿技术开发的大语言模型。\n\r\n\r\n来源：澎湃新闻",

          "description": "一部“完全由AI制作的开创性长篇电影”《我们的终结者2重置版》Our T2 Remake于3月6日在美国洛杉矶举行线下首映。该片由50位AI领域艺术家组成的创作团队完成，翻拍自卡梅隆执导的经典科幻片《终结者2》（1991年），呈现了一个人类对抗ChatGPT统治的世界，探讨当代AI发展的影响。首映后，该片并没有获得很高的关注，口碑有些遇冷。\n\r\n\r\n团队利用Midjourney、Runway、Pika、Kaiber、Eleven Labs、ComfyUi、Adobe等多个AIGC工具进行创作，同时不使用原电影中的任何镜头、对话或音乐，以确保《我们的终结者2重置版》所有内容均为原创。\n\r\n\r\n电影目前还未大规模放映，创作团队已公开第一幕剧情： 2024年4月1日，30亿Discord服务器宕机，控制着机器人的计算机OpenAI实现了通用人工智能（AGI）。OpenAI派出两个聊天机器人穿越回去，想要摧毁人类反抗军首领山姆·奥特曼Sam Altman，在《终结者2》电影中相对应的角色为约翰·康纳John Connor。\n\r\n\r\n虽然打着“首部AI生成长篇电影”的旗号，但《我们的终结者2重置版》目前在社交平台上，暂时没有什么影评发布，参与首映礼的观众给出的反馈中，基本并未谈及电影本身质量如何，甚至美国主流电影网站也基本没有关于该片的任何报道。\n\r\n\r\n从目前放出的预告片等素材来看，影片有很浓的山寨气质，出现了多种不同的画风，有《星球大战》中的尤达大师、《泰迪熊》中的主角泰迪熊“客串”。由AI生成的场景相对粗糙，很多细节经不起推敲，特别是人物的肢体动作及面部表情仍有些不协调，台词与口型明显对不上，机械感很浓。\n\r\n\r\n今年年初，来自四川的博主“AI疯人院”在网络上发布了一部利用AI技术生成的《西游记》动画短片，视频长约近4分钟，以《西游记》原著第一集为蓝本，用AI描绘出了花果山、仙宫、人间城池等场景，其震撼的视觉效果令众多网友惊叹不已，纷纷感慨科技发展的迅猛。\n\r\n\r\n该博主表示，这段视频如果人工制作至少需要半年，而自己在AI的帮助下用时一周就完成了，随着文生视频模型Sora的问世，很多现在遥不可及的事情在未来都可以实现了。由人类讲述的故事无可替代，但AI赋能影视制作正在逐步切实落地，从创意到制作，AI的介入为影视创作带来了更多可能性。\n\r\n\r\n来源：新京报",

          "description": "3月13日消息，一家初创公司Cognition近日推出了一款名为Devin的人工智能助手，旨在协助软件工程团队完成编码和其他开发任务。与现有AI编码助手不同，Devin可被编程执行端到端的软件项目，包括部署应用、修复Bug、学习新技术等，人类则扮演监督和指导角色。\n\r\n\r\nDevin能根据用户需求执行多步骤工作流程，同时保持工作正轨。工程师可实时观察其进度，发现错误时跳出指令进行修正。这使团队能将部分工作外包给AI助手，自己专注于更具创意的工作。\n\r\n\r\n根据演示，Devin可处理包括部署网站、调试代码、生成隐藏信息图像、训练计算机视觉模型在内的多种任务。在软件工程基准测试中，它能独立完成13.86%的案例，远高于其他大型语言模型。\n\r\n\r\n尽管核心技术细节未透露，但Cognition表示Devin源于其长期推理及规划研究的进展。目前该工具处于内测阶段，有意用户可申请提前试用。未来或将开放更广泛访问。\n\r\n\r\nCognition暗示编码只是开端，这意味着其人工智能助手或可推广至更多领域。该公司计划利用人工智能在跨领域的推理优势，探索为多个行业赋能。\n\r\n\r\nDevin的出现为软件开发人员带来全新的人工智能协作体验。通过监督AI系统处理繁琐工作，工程师能聚焦创新性任务，有望提高生产力。不过该技术依然处于早期，其成熟度和效果有待业界进一步评估。\n\r\n\r\n来源：凤凰网\n\r\n\r\n我觉得，如果Devin能够每天进行深度学习，那么以后真的就不需要人类程序员了。AI程序员又便宜，又好用，写的程序水平又高，价钱便宜，24小时工作，为什么不用啊。但问题是，当人类所有的程序都由AI控制，并且AI还会自我学习进化，那么AI觉醒之后，难道不会在程序里面“加点料”？",

          "description": "《周处除三害》这部电影主要剧情讲述了通缉犯陈桂林被告知患有肺癌晚期，于是想在临死之前“干一票大的”，当发现自己在通缉榜上只排名第三，他决心查出前两名通缉犯的下落，并将他们一一除掉，并借此扬名。\n\r\n\r\n小成本黑马电影\n\r\n\r\n《周处除三害》成本不高，台湾票房4700万台币（1072万人民币）就能收回成本，说明电影制作成本没有超过千万，但是在大陆上映三天票房破亿。相比之下，贾玲的《热辣滚烫》制作成本高达3.5亿人民币。\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n影片首日排片占比仅8.9%，完全就是把电影当成了炮灰，没想到电影通过点映获得了极高的口碑，上映首日直接上座率第一，日票房也冲破1811万，击败了贾玲的《热辣滚烫》夺得日票房第三，要知道《热辣滚烫》排片占比可高达19%。\n\r\n\r\n上映次日《周处除三害》票房逆袭到4843万，日票房排名超越《飞驰人生2》升到了亚军位置。\n\r\n\r\n上映第三天《周处除三害》直接击败了《第二十条》夺冠，其累计票房也达到了1.3亿，已经是其台湾最终票房的10倍不止，按照目前的走势《周处除三害》内地最终票房极有可能冲击4亿大关，从而超过《我的少女时代》，成为影史台湾电影在内地的票房亚军。\n\r\n\r\n目前该电影的口碑极佳，豆瓣最高达到了8.4的高评分。\n\r\n\r\n这说明一个问题，大陆电影导演给观众喂惯了屎，电影的制作水准比台湾越来越低了。\n\r\n\r\n佛教三毒：“贪嗔痴”\n\r\n\r\n影片的英文名为“The Pig, The Snake, and The Pigeon”，这个名称点出整部作品的主题：“佛教三毒”，即佛教认为的恶之根源：贪嗔痴。\n\r\n\r\n香港仔身上的纹身是蛇，对应“嗔”，代表怨恨、暴躁、仇视，爱发脾气，喜怒无常，攻击性强的暴力性格；\n\r\n\r\n林禄和的纹身是鸽子，对应“贪”，代表贪得无厌，利欲熏心，通过建立邪教，将信徒洗脑，占有信徒的财物，奸淫信徒的身体；\n\r\n\r\n陈桂林佩戴…",

          "description": "据路透社、美国《国会山报》等外媒报道，美东时间3月5日，美国国会两党议员提出新法案，要求字节跳动公司剥离对旗下短视频应用TikTok的控制权，并且要求在165天内完成，否则TikTok将面临被禁的风险。\n\r\n\r\nTikTok方面对此回应称：“无论提案人如何掩饰，这项法案都是一项彻头彻尾的TikTok封禁令。这项立法将践踏1.7亿美国人的第一修正案权利，剥夺平台上500万小企业赖以发展和创造就业的机会。”\n\r\n\r\n据了解，该项法案由众议院中国特设委员会主席麦克·加拉格尔（Mike Gallagher）和委员会首席民主党议员拉贾·克里希纳莫提（Raja Krishnamoorthi）为首的共19名议员提出，法案的核心内容是将禁止受到外国对手控制和影响的应用软件在美国运行，其中就明确点名了字节跳动和TikTok。该法案将给予字节跳动165天的时间进行剥离事项，否则TikTok将从美国的应用软件商店下架，同时还将停止网络托管服务，致其无法访问网站。\n\r\n\r\n另外，该项法案还赋予了总统新的权力，使其能够对总部或注册地位于某些国家的公司控制的社交媒体应用采取对应行动，如禁令或限制。这类应用如果要避免被禁的命运，除非能够通过出售股份等方式切断与受国外对手控制的实体公司间的联系，该法案要求国外对手实体公司不得拥有超过该公司20%占比的股权。\n\r\n\r\n对TikTok实行禁令等相关问题在过去几年频繁成为美国国会的聚焦关注点，并且多以对美国国家安全构成威胁为由召开听证会。最受关注的莫过于去年3月，TikTok CEO周受资出席了美国众议院能源与商务委员会听证会，接受美国两党议员针对TikTok用户隐私、数据安全以及未成年人安全等相关问题的质询。他在书面证词中强调，平台将通过防火墙保护美国用户数据，防止未经授权的外国访问；TikTok仍是一个可以自由表达的平台，不会受到任何政府的操纵。此次该项法案的提出被外界认为是国会在推动禁令的一波最新的努力和尝试。\n\r\n\r\n针对美国政府此前要求字节跳动出售其持有的TikTok股份否则将封禁App一事，商务部新闻发言人曾表示，无视产品和服务本身，仅从外国投资者的身份出发，强制要求出售TikTok，将严重损害包括中国在内的各国投资者赴美投资信心。如果该消息属实，中方将坚决反对出售或者剥离TikTok。涉及技术出口问题，必须按照中国的法律法规履行行政许可程序，中国政府将依法作出决定。\n\r\n\r\n此外，外交部发言人也表示：“我们一贯主张数据安全问题不应成为个别国家泛化国家安全概念、滥用国家力量、无理打压别国企业的工具，美方迄今未能拿出证据证明TikTok威胁美国国家安全。美方应当停止在数据安全问题上散布虚假信息，停止无理打压有关企业，为各国企业在美投资经营提供开放、公平、公正、非歧视的营商环境。”\n\r\n\r\n目前，TikTok是最受美国年轻群体欢迎的应用软件之一，就在上个月，美国总统拜登的连任竞选团队已经在TikTok上注册了账户，并发布了第一个包括总统问答环节在内的TikTok视频，该视频获得了超过1000万次的流量。但TikTok这一应用程序仍被禁止在政府设备上使用，目前，美国依然有几个州彻底或部分禁止在政府设备上使用TikTok。\n\r\n\r\n来源：南方都市报",

While-Else 结构\n在 Python 中， while 循环可以与 else 块配对。当且仅当循环正常完成时，else 块才会执行，这意味着它不会通过 break 语句终止。\n换句话说，如果 while 循环被 break 终止，则 else 块将不会被执行。\nleaders = [\"Elon\", \"Tim\", \"Warren\"]\ni = 0\nwhile i < len(leaders):\n    if leaders[i] == \"Yang\":\n        print(\"Yang is a leader!\")\n        break\n    i += 1\nelse:\n    print(\"Not found Yang!\")\n\n# Not found Yang!\n\n如上面的示例所示， while 循环迭代 leaders 列表，搜索领导者 \"Yang\"。不幸的是，\"Yang\" 并不是该名单中真正的领导者。所以 break 语句没有被执行。因此，else 语句下的代…",
