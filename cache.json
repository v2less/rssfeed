We spent the past 7 months building a solid experience to replicate data from Postgres to data warehouses. Now we're expanding to queues.\nPeerDB Streams provides a simple and native way to replicate changes as they happen in Postgres to Queues (Kafka, Redpanda, Google PubSub, etc). We use Postgres logical decoding to enable Change Data Capture (CDC).\nBlog post here: https://blog.peerdb.io/peerdb-streams-simple-native-postgres.... 10-min quickstart here: https://docs.peerdb.io/quickstart/streams-quickstart.\nWe chose queues as many users found that existing tools are complex. Debezium is the most used tool for this use-case. It has large production usage. However, a common pain point among …",

          "description": "I’ve loved keeping plants since I was a kid. But the online world of plants can be confusing - strange vocabulary, plants going by conflicting names, and hundreds of niche websites. I wanted to create a site that would organize all of this info and make it easier to explore and discover new plants. That’s why I created GetAnyPlant, which aggregates and matches plants from dozens of online stores. It includes huge amounts of data on these plants along with filters and categories to help you search. You can also save plants to your wishlist and add notes to them.\nI’m a data scientist by profession, so probably 80% of the work was totally new to me. I built v1 using wordpress , v2 using django, and v3 I pivoted to using react and next js for frontend.\nI would greatly appreciate any feedback on the site as well as any advice on how to grow it.\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40273470\nPoints: 285\n# Comments: 94",

          "description": "At one point during the construction of my house, we needed designs for the kitchen and bathroom cabinets and a bedroom wardrobe.\nI wanted full control of the design process. Doing it in vector illustration software was too painful and it was taking too long. But I didn't have the time to learn any complex CAD tool either.\nSo I developed a small HTML/JS/CSS tool for designing MDF furniture by writing my own little language that transpiles into a CSS grid layout.\nTake a look at the blog post for details:\nhttps://alnvdl.github.io/2023/01/07/designing-furniture-usin...\nOr go directly to the tool (works best on desktop or tablet): https://alnvdl.github.io/squareplanner/\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40267182\nPoints: 52\n# Comments: 12",

          "description": "A (lengthy!) tutorial on how to write your own JS-based autopilot code to fly planes in Microsoft Flight Simulator with a web page to both visualize the flight and control the AP.\nNote that this is a complete do-over of a previous page that used a combination of Python and JavaScript, and only covered basic autopilot functionality. This rewrite threw all of that out, and goes much, much further:\nyou just want to have the plane take off without having to do anything? Check, this tutorial covers auto-takeoff.\nFlying with waypoint-based navigation, not by \"programming airports and radio beacons one letter at a time with a jog-dial\" but by just placing markers on a map and dragging those around as you please, mid-flight, Google Maps style? Check. After all, why would we not, putting a map on a webpage is super easy (barely an inconvenience).\nIn fact, let's throw in flight plan saving and loading, so others can fly the same route!\nAnd maybe you want the plane to fly a fixed distance above the ground, instead of at a fixed altitude... well: check. You'll learn about terrain-follow using free Digital Elevation Model datasets for planet Earth.\nAnd of course the big one, for the ultimate \"click button, JS flies the plane start to finish\" experience: ever wished the in-game autopilot could just land the plane for you? Well, it's a video game, and we know programming, so: why not? We're also implementing auto-landing and it's going to be amazing.\nIf you play MSFS, and you're a developer/programmer, and you've always thought how cool it would be if you could just do some scripting for it... you can, there's a lot of cool stuff you can do!\nAnd of course if you don't want to follow along and just want to have everything set up and ready to fly your plane, just clone https://github.com/Pomax/are-we-flying and have fun.\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40267164\nPoints: 61\n# Comments: 11",

          "description": "Hi HN!\nI'm Jonathan and I built Hacker Search (https://hackersearch.net), a semantic search engine for Hacker News. Type a keyword or a description of what you're interested in, and you'll get top links from HN surfaced to you along with brief summaries.\nUnlike HN's otherwise very valuable search feature, Hacker Search doesn't require you to get your keywords exactly right. That's achieved by leveraging OpenAI's latest embedding models alongside more traditional indexes extracted from the scraped and cleaned up contents of the links.\nI think there are many more interesting things one could build atop the HN dataset in the age of LLMs (e.g. more explicitly searching for technical opinions, recommending stories to you based on your interests, and making the core search feature more useful). If any of those sound interesting to you, head over to https://hackersearch.net/signup to get notified when I launch them!\nNote: at least one person has built something similar before (https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36391655). Funnily enough, I only found out about this through my own implementation, and I based on my testing, I think Hacker Search generally performs better when doing keyword/sentence searches (vs. whole document similarity lookup), thanks to the way the data is indexed.\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40238509\nPoints: 138\n# Comments: 57",

          "description": "Hey HN! My name is Andrew, and I'm thrilled to share with you a project I've been working on called Factful.\nI'm a high school student with a passion for tackling misinformation online. Inspired by the need for more reliable content verification tools, I decided to create Factful. It's an AI-powered web app designed to revolutionize how individuals and organizations verify content.\nUnlike traditional grammar checkers, Factful provides a comprehensive analysis that goes beyond just grammar. It evaluates context, factuality, coherence, and more to ensure the accuracy and credibility of content.\nI believe that in today's information age, it's more crucial than ever to have tools like Factful to combat misinformation and promote content integrity. I'm excited to continue developing Factful and would love for you to check it out. Your feedback and support would mean the world to me. Thanks for taking the time to read about Factful, and please go check out our beta deployment of Factful (a little beyond the MVP) for free on our website!\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40222051\nPoints: 111\n# Comments: 81",

We built a simple open-source CLI tool that recommends a cost-optimal workload based on actual usage data from observability tools. Check it out at https://github.com/kaytu-io/kaytu   \nCurrently, we support AWS EC2 On-Demand Servers & EBS Storage using observability data from…",

          "description": "Hey HN, exciting news! Our RAG framework, Cognita (https://github.com/truefoundry/cognita), born from collaborations with diverse enterprises, is now open-source. Currently, it offers seamless integrations with Qdrant and SingleStore.\nIn recent weeks, numerous engineers have explored Cognita, providing invaluable insights and feedback. We deeply appreciate your input and encourage ongoing dialogue (share your thoughts in the comments – let's keep this ‘open source’).\nWhile RAG is undoubtedly powerful, the process of building a functional application with it can feel overwhelming. From selecting the right AI models to organizing data effectively, there's a lot to navigate. While tools like LangChain and LlamaIndex simplify prototyping, an accessible, ready-to-use open-source RAG template with modular support is still missing. That's where Cognita comes in.\nKey benefits of Cognita:\n1. Central repository for parsers, loaders, embedders, and retrievers.\n2. User-friendly UI empowers non-technical users to upload documents and engage in Q&A.\n3. Fully API-driven for seamless integration with other systems.\nWe invite you to explore Cognita and share your feedback as we refine and expand its capabilities. Interested in contributing? Join the journey at https://www.truefoundry.com/cognita-launch.\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40181306\nPoints: 61\n# Comments: 5",

          "description": "For the last few years, I've been working at a non-profit called Hack Club developing tools to support self-motivated teens to learn about technology and build community with other like-minded peers while doing so.\nThis has resulted in the development of a model called \"you ship, we ship.\" We build open source creative coding environments, and when teenagers share the projects they make with these tools, we send them materials to dive deeper into the subject and related technologies. Our approach is predicated on the constructionist idea that people learn best by building things they care about and sharing them with others. The vision we have is to create a public collection of creative learning tools that offer people projects they can do right away and communities of practice to engage with.\nBlot is our next installment in the series. It's designed to be a gateway to CNC robotics through digital art. If you'd like to see some of the projects people have made so far, you can check out:\nhttps://blot.hackclub.com/gallery\nYou can also find projects from our first \"you ship, we ship\" called Sprig. It's a game console you get by building a game for it.\nhttps://sprig.hackclub.com/gallery\nI'd love people's thoughts on the model and ideas for other subjects in technology we could build projects around.\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40180475\nPoints: 25\n# Comments: 8",

This year-long undertaking follows the completed Nand to Tetris course, but ported to the web with its own runtime, user interface, and IDE. Using the \"Load example program\" selector, you can try out some programs I wrote on NAND's emulated hardware such as 2048, a genetic algorithm, and a manual stack overflow to corrupt the screen.\nCheck out NAND at https://nand.arhan.sh\nAdditionally, I've authored an extensive writeup about the project.

We take care of the annoyances of external APIs (167 and counting) so you can quickly build custom integrations for your SaaS, while retaining full control over how they work.\n2 min demo video: https://www.loom.com/share/d04c67b47e284e86b91b4b99fba548ec\nSaaS engineering teams face a tough choice: they can build each integration in-house from scratch, which gives them full control but takes a lot of time and maintenance effort. Or they can use pre-built solutions, which are fast and easy but less flexible and might not fulfill all customer needs.\nNango combines the best of both worlds.

          "description": "Hi all, we recently open sourced the first version of Hashquery, a Python library which lets you model analytics, DRY up common logic, and execute it against a database or warehouse.\nWe were originally rendering SQL directly for all our queries, but that spiraled out of control with more complex analysis; the SQL needed to be changed sporadically for each new database dialect (BigQuery, Redshift, Aethena, Postgres, etc etc) and the SQL fragments were very challenging to reuse (and so fragments were copy-pasted all over).\n~~~\nAdvantages we think it has over writing SQL by hand:\n- Queries are fully compossible, so any analysis can be chained into further analysis without refactoring.\n- All analysis executes within the data warehouse itself, making them super fast for big data.\n- It's just Python, so you can extend or parameterize query logic with a simple def function.\n- You can run it anywhere, like inside of unit tests, ETL nodes, or Jupyter notebooks.\n- Developer experience is pretty good since editors already know how to autocomplete Python. ChatGPT knows Python already too :)\n- The library handles normalizing between database dialects. Write once and use in any database.\n- Hashquery content is fully serializable, which makes it a good fit for exposing a flexible API for consumers to efficiently query datamarts or internal analytics. We use it as the endpoint for headless BI, as opposed to having to define and teach a DSL or GraphQL specification.\n~~~\nWe've built native funnel analysis on top of Hashquery and have been thrilled with it so far, and we thought others might want to use it too.

After extensive testing I feel like it's ready for general release[1].\nGetada was inspired by Rustup[2] and aside from the init script is written entirely in Ada.\nIt's completely open source and you can check out the readme and code on github[3]. It currently supports all non-windows platforms that Alire has an official release for, which at present is Linux (glibc) and MacOS.  If you try running it on an unsupported platform, it tries to point you in the right direction.  For example, you can install Alire on windows with an already-existing installer.\nIt downloads the latest version of Alire[4] (Ada's toolchain and package manager, simila…",

          "description": "I drifted into the Conway's Life research community in 2001 when I won a small cash prize for a lucky discovery of something called a \"boojum reflector\". My involvement has gradually snowballed since then. Off and on I've helped maintain various Life-related mailing lists and blogs, the Life Lexicon, and more recently the conwaylife.com forums and LifeWiki.\nAnother thing I stumbled into was helping Nathaniel Johnson complete an improbably thorough 480-page Conway's Life textbook, with end-of-chapter exercises and everything.  The book could be used to teach a college-level class on the subject. https://conwaylife.com/book/ has a free PDF download for the book.\nSo... I'm not the cleverest Lifenthusiast by a long shot, but for a random question about the Game of Life, I'm more likely to know something about it than at least 99.9999% of the world's population.

          "description": "I've been going through Cem Yuksel's \"Introduction to Computer Graphics\" course and thought that writing a volume renderer would be a good way to test my knowledge. It is a common technique used to render 3D medical data. Works by ray marching a specific step size, reading a 3D texture (e.g. MRI data), and calculating opacity values.\nCode should be easy to get started with for anyone familiar with the JS ecosystem.\nQuestions for the HN community: I spent 20-25% of the entire time just setting up the project and fighting issues with the JavaScript ecosystem. This experience has made me consider learning Cpp, Metal, and XCode. Has anyone made the transition from WebGL/TS to Cpp or done it the other way around? What was your experience with it? And what about debugging? That's a big issue with WebGL.\nAs for now, I'm thinking about picking up WebGPU next because it has an up-and-coming debugger made by Brendan Duncan[0] that looks promising.\nEdit: Anyone know why MRI data is sent via CDs and not the web? I started working on this project specifically because some people close to me got MRI scans and received CDs of their results. I know that some MRI data can be huge so downloading over the web doesn't make sense, but anything under 64MB should be sent over the web, no? For reference, I believe most MRI data can be under 250MB[1].\n[0] https://github.com/brendan-duncan/webgpu_inspector\n[1] https://www.researchgate.net/figure/Typical-image-dimensions...\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40107112\nPoints: 68\n# Comments: 24",

It generates a step-by-step tutorial guide for YouTube videos that you can follow along without watching long videos. Best suited for tutorial videos but can work for other videos aswell. No BS. Just straight to the point.\nThe guides are generated from pure transcript so you don't have to worry about it being AI. It's my first project as a total beginner. Something I had to do inorder to get out of tutorial hell.\nPlease let me know if you have any suggestions or if you face any problems or bugs. I would try to fix them to the best of my abilities and as soon as possible.\nI would appreciate your feedback on this. Let me know what you think!\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40104641\nPoints: 128\n# Comments: 48",

          "description": "Hey all,\nI recently graduated from a good PhD program studying NLP. Unlike any sane person who would go become a professor or make a gazillion dollars in industry, I decided to try bootstrapping my own software business. This is my first product.\nThe inspiration was from my research on computers understanding social norms. When ChatGPT came out, I was amazed how well it could understand social etiquette. I thought it'd be fun to make a game where you have to talk your way out of sticky situations - like you miss your friend's birthday party, or your boss catches you trying to leave work at 2pm.\nI made a prototype in a couple days, and it was super fun to play with. I thought I'd spend a \"couple months\" making a game for others to play online. Now, only 10 months and 923.3 hours of work later, it's playable in early access.\nIn the game, you talk out loud (ASR), and the NPCs (LLM + TTS) talk back at you. It is fun to play with a friend! And because it's just talking, non-gamers do great, often better than gamers.\nI really want to have a free demo, but no time yet to implement. For now, it's purchase only ($4.99). If anyone decides to try it, I'd really love to get more feedback. It was an enormous learning experience, especially targeting the web - so many partially supported web APIs and browser inconsistencies! Still feels like 2008 in some ways.\nAlso happy to answer questions of course. Thanks, and enjoy the weekend!\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40091379\nPoints: 26\n# Comments: 8",

          "description": "Here's a project I've been working on for the last few months.\nIt's a new (I think) algorithm, that allows to adjust smoothly - and in real time - how many calculations you'd like to do during inference of an LLM model.\nIt seems that it's possible to do just 20-25% of weight multiplications instead of all of them, and still get good inference results.\nI implemented it to run on M1/M2/M3 GPU. The mmul approximation itself can be pushed to run 2x fast before the quality of output collapses.\nThe inference speed is just a bit faster than Llama.cpp's, because the rest of implementation could be better, but with a better development I think it can be a new method to speed up inference - in addition to quantization.\nYou could call it ad-hoc model distillation :)\nYou can change the speed / accuracy of a model at will, in real time.\nOh, and as a side effect, the data format allows to also choose how much of the model you want to load into the memory. You can decide to skip say 10-20-40% of the least important weights.\nIt's implemented for Mistral, it was also tested slightly on Mixtral and Llama. It's for FP16 for now, but Q8 is in the works.\nThe algorithm is described here, and the implementation is open source.\nhttps://kolinko.github.io/effort/\nI know these are bold claims, but I hope they survive the scrutiny :)\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40067677\nPoints: 183\n# Comments: 62",

          "description": "Hey HN! Happy to finally launch Stack. We made it because we like to put apps into production quickly, and authentication & user management was taking up way too much time.\nWe have components like  and  that automatically adapt to whatever theme & design system you're using. Check the blog post to see the example with Radix UI and Joy UI.\nAlso, there's an admin dashboard for monitoring and editing accounts. Stack is 100% AGPL/MIT-licensed, so you can self-host it.\nCheers!\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40031090\nPoints: 83\n# Comments: 37",

          "description": "Hey folks,\nAbout a year ago my wife and I, both closing in on 40, quit our jobs at Red Hat to start a games company and learn game development. Many things happened along the road, and about a week ago we released our first (small) game on Steam.\nhttps://store.steampowered.com/app/2816120/Mazelit/\nThe demo is free to play up to level 8 (the final game plays up to level 80) and we'd appreciate any feedback you have, whether it's for the store page or the game itself.\nWe made the game in Godot 4.2 in roughly 3 months and I was working full time next to it. Since we ran into a bunch of roadblocks, we decided to also offer the entire source code up as a DLC in case someone wants to go look how we implemented the game, mod the game, or compile it for a different platform. The only thing we can't redistribute with the game code is the Steamworks SDK, which is available for download from Steam. (The game minus integration is fully runnable without the SDK, though.)\nCheers and happy weekend!\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40017180\nPoints: 19\n# Comments: 1",

          "description": "Hello everyone!\nAt a company I worked for, we needed to develop an MVP (basically a web page) and apply certain business logic to a Google Drive spreadsheet that was frequently updated by the Sales team.\nIn this case, we had two options:\nDevelop a backend to replace the current spreadsheet and have the sales team use it as a new \"backoffice\" - This would take a very long time, and if the hypothesis we were testing was wrong, it would be time wasted.\nCreate the web page and use Google's SDK to extract data from the spreadsheet.\nWe chose to go with the second option because it was quicker. Indeed, it was much faster than creating a new backoffice. But not as quick as we imagined. Integrating with Google's SDK requires some effort, especially to handle the OAuth logic, configure it in the console, and understand the documentation (which is quite shallow, by the way).\nAnyway! We did the project and I realized that maybe other devs might have encountered similar issues. Therefore, I developed a tool that transforms Google spreadsheets into \"realtime APIs\" with PATCH, GET, POST, and DELETE methods.\nSince it's a product for devs, I think it would be cool to hear your opinions. It's still quite primitive, but the basic features already work.\nhttps://zerosheets.com\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40014730\nPoints: 96\n# Comments: 53",

          "description": "Hi HN,\nmoved by curiosity about how to build an autonomous agent, and to explore the boundaries of machine creativity, I built a fictional entity (dubbed Livia) powered by LLMs, Multimodal models and text-to-image models to find some answers.\nWhat happened instead is that more questions have cropped up. An important hypothesis of this project is that, by observing the train of thought and witnessing the simulated state of mind and emotional emulation surrounding it, humans could empathize with a machine. What happens when that's the case? Would people enjoy companionship from a synthetic person? Would the Art establishment ever consider a non-human author (capable of making art and interacting with other humans) an Artist?\nWhatever the answers, I can't shake away the feeling that human uniqueness is being eroded and that we risk facing a crisis of meaning. Perhaps projects such as this help us demonize those fears, similarly to how sci-fi does, even though the boundary between fiction and reality is blurring.\nThis was a collaboration with Tibor (hn user: https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=tiborsaas). Read our release posts on:\nhttps://jamez.it/blog/b/14f\nand\nhttps://tibor.szasz.hu/post/stream-of-consciousness\nHope you enjoy it as much as we had fun building it.\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40011937\nPoints: 44\n# Comments: 13",

          "description": "Here's a \"behind-the-scenes\" look at my development of a cool sensor during my PhD (electrical engineering). This sensor is only about 1/3 of my total research for my degree and took about a year.\nI've been on HN for a while now and I've seen my fair share of posts about the woes of pursuing a PhD. Now that I'm done with mine I wanna share some anecdotal evidence that doing a PhD can actually be enjoyable (not necessarily easy) and also be doable in 3 years.\nWhen I started I knew I didn't want to work on something that would never leave the lab or languish in a dissertation PDF no one will ever read. Thanks to an awesome advisor I think I managed to thread the needle between simplicity and functionality.\nLooking back, the ideas and methods behind it are pretty straightforward, but getting there took some doing. It’s funny how things seem obvious once you've figured them out!\nOh, I love creating GUIs for sensor data and visualizations as you'll see -- it's such a game changer! pyqtgraph is my go-to at the moment - such a great library.\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40003710\nPoints: 441\n# Comments: 90",

          "description": "Hey HN,\nMy cofounder and I trained an AI music generation model and after a month of testing we're launching 1.0 today. Ours is interesting because it's a latent diffusion model instead of a language model, which makes it more controllable: https://sonauto.ai/\nOthers do music generation by training a Vector Quantized Variational Autoencoder like Descript Audio Codec (https://github.com/descriptinc/descript-audio-codec) to turn music into tokens, then training an LLM on those tokens. Instead, we ripped the tokenization part off and replaced it with a normal variational autoencoder bottleneck (along with some other important changes to enable insane compression ratios). This gave us a nice, normally distributed latent space on which to train a diffusion transformer (like Sora). Our diffusion…",

I have an older gaming laptop, and as you know they are power hogs. Whilst on battery life, I don't game, I only do work such as editing spreadsheets and watch YouTube using PiP. My battery life on Windows was less than an hour, yet Linux (Mint!) manages to do 4+ hours easily.

Been searching here and there, skimmed through lots and lots of beautiful music visualization, and in the process stumbled upon three projects/programs/pieces of software that do exactly what I want, just not exactly in the way I'd like to have it, being simply in a terminal, or separate window.\n Someone wrote a DeaDBeeF plugin for it, but that, obviously, requires me to use DeaDBeeF to play the music. Then there's Friture - open source, Python and Qt. If I were capable, I could probably \"lift\" the spectrogram component of the program into its own \"canvas\" thingy or some such, but I don't nearly have the skills.. In the same vein there is Spectro, awesome in action, but brought to me in a browser..\n Does anyone have any advice or counsel?\n e: I coulda/shoulda clarified my question with the simple example of, say, CAVA - visualizing what I'm playing, but then not with a spectrum, but a spectrogram.

          "description": "I've been using ungoogled chromium through Flatpak for 1-2 years now and recently installed the Flatpak backend for my distro's software management GUI to make updates a bit simpler.\n What i didn't expect was that probably around the same time, the package that i've been using (com.github.Eloston.UngoogledChromium) got deprecated and replaced and so updating uninstalled this version and installed the replacement which has a different package ID on Flathub now.\n What i think happened is that because of the new package ID or changes within the package the path for the config has changed. Effectively this meant that after i updated all my packages and started my browser on the next day, everything was completely gone. My backups only run weekly and i've piled up some important bookmarks and tabs in the past couple of days, so at first i was a bit in shock and thought i had lost everything.\n Thinking that software updates should never delete app-related user data (e.g. chromium profiles) i ran `locate chromium` and after a bit of digging discovered the \"lost\" data in `~/.var/...`. After doing a quick backup on those files i just tried forcing the install of the deprecated flatpak package and all my stuff is still here. Now that i'm relieved i can figure out how to properly migrate the data to the new install.\n So now i'm wondering: Would the Flatpak CLI have told me about this deprecation and substitution so that i could expect this? Should i have not used Flatpak and instead used some of the unofficial binaries linked on the project's github.io page? KDE \"Discovery\" = bad for flatpak updating? Or is this all on me and there is some changelog that i must keep up to date with in order not to be surprised by something like this?\n What do you think?\n    submitted by    /u/wffln  \n [link]   [comments]",

Fuck this ChatGPT shit lmao! I am including all of my chat why I had to make this crap post as a reply to one of the comments.\n [Original post]:\n <rant>\n Topic: mprotect() posix feature, C and Linux.\n I learned a couple days ago about this mprotect(..) thing how you can use it to set protection like PROT_READ, PROT_WRITE etc on memory regions that are multiple of the page size the OS is using. To do this, the memory region(s) must be multiple of page size as well as it must be aligned to the page addresses. The memalign(..) or posix_memalign(..) can do those stuff before finally using the mprotect(..);\n Today I found out that it only protects from normal memory access operation like memset, malloc / new etc.\n I can easily change the values of the variables inside a protected (PROT_READ) region from an external memory cheat engine program or using pointer arithmetic from inside the program or even directly accessing the variables within the protected memory region.\n Why the heck do we even have this false sense of \"REaD onLy\" bullcrap in the first place when practically any external malicious program can write into these \"pRoTecTEd\" memory regions? The OS does nothing to protect our memory region despite using the mprotect() bullcrap.\n I just wanted to vent this out somewhere.

          "description": "I spent a lot of time reading and thinking about if I want to learn Emacs or Vim since they have very high learning curves, I went with Vim because I had been looking a way to better edit text. Vim's modal editing is very powerful, allowing me to make lots of changes to text with only a handful of keystrokes. I wonder if that's why most Vim and Neovim users chose it over Emacs and if that's why Vim is much more popular than Emacs.\n Emacs is a modeless editor and you need a third party emulation like Evil mode for modal editing, but that's not full Vim. You wouldn't be able to install Vim or Neovim plugin, especially ones that extend its modal editing capabilities like the Vim surround plugin. Perhaps it might be possible to use the headless Neovim backend for text editing in Emacs, like the VS Code Neovim extension or Firenvim Firefox addon does, but why do that when you could just use Neovim?\n I think that all the extensibility Emacs has to make it essentially an app platform alone isn't something that appeals to a lot of users, but what if Emacs had modal editing as good as Vi / Vim's from the start? It seems like Vi Vim and even Neovim never had the level of extensibility as Emacs does, so what if it was a matter of picking between a modal editor, and a modal editor with lots of extensibility? (an oversimplified hypothetical comparison but still).\n And by the way, what was the rationale for the decision of Emacs to be a modeless editor rather than a modal editor?\n    submitted by    /u/TheTwelveYearOld  \n [link]   [comments]",

Some work great, others leave stuff to be desired:\n  \nCalendar and events - google calendar for sync, thunderbird for PC and gmail on mobile. Downside is that I need to have thunderbird on for this, because I didn't find a secure way to sync \"natively\" via e.g. KDE calendar app.\n \nMail - thunderbird and gmail mobile.\n \nTODO/do soon: Open bookmarks. I do have Joplin installed on both my PC and phone, and synced, but TBH IDK what's about it but I very rarely check it/use it. Maybe it's too clunky or I am not used to it. Honestly, what works best here are those small post it-sized papers that I leave lying around my desk.\n \nKnowledge base: random txt files, ods spreadsheets and bookmarks. I manage mostly with bookmarks, but ideally a wiki would be used (I think).\n \n What are your solutions? I find that oftentimes the best solution is the one that requires the least friction, and that I don't need fancy stuff. Other 2 things that are a must are \"seamlessness\" - syncing across multiple devices in a timely manner, and reliability (alerts always go off, notes aren't lost etc.).\n    submitted by    /u/LegatusDivinae  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hey everyone! As a student myself, I've been really frustrated with the current note-taking and homework tracking apps out there. They're clunky, confusing, and really not designed with my needs overall in mind. (Google Docs was my go-to but it's not FOSS so fuck it) \n That's why I'm working on creating a brand new productivity app specifically for students - one that makes it super easy to take notes in class, keep track of assignments and due dates, and stay organized. \n The core features I've thought of:\n 📝 Note-Taking: A clean, distraction-free interface to take handwritten or typed notes, with great formatting options like asciidoc and Markdown. Easily organize notes by class.\n 📚 Homework Hub: Enter assignments and due dates from each class. Get reminders (service? cron? idk) so nothing slips through the cracks.\n 👜 Backpack: Upload course materials, study guides, and other files to keep everything in one place. (I might not add this feature unless you guys want it)\n But this is just my initial vision - I want this to be an app built FOR students BY a fellow student. So please comment with any other features you'd love to see! What frustrations could this app solve? What would make your life easier? \n Here's a sketch (keep in mind that I don't really plan to stick to this, and I will be taking your inputs): https://imgur.com/QuBBU3Q\n    submitted by    /u/JustThePerfectBee  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Plenty of folk actively avoid or discourage others from using Ubuntu due to Snap alone. Even those that remain Ubuntu users frequently mention disabling snap. \n Meanwhile, Flatpak is often portrayed in a very different light and its use is actively encouraged when the necessity arises even when it's not enabled by default, whether it be for installing software from outside main repositories without worrying about dependencies, confinement and permission control, installing proprietary software not easily available in distro repositores, accessing versions of software newer than what's packaged in the distro repositories.\n But all these are also the advantages of snap packages, so why wouldn't it be encouraged as well for Ubuntu users?\n Both formats exist for those reasons and pretty much accomplish the same goal. That's like claiming you shouldn't be using Debian because it uses .deb format, use Fedora instead because it uses .rpm format, although both are accomplishing the same. \n Ironically, despite this, some notorious FOSS apps like Obsidian and Bitwarden still prefer to provide an .appimage on their official website, which is odd considering how popular Ubuntu is and how promoted Flatpak is, and the fact that appimages have poor system integration.\n    submitted by    /u/sdnavigator  \n [link]   [comments]",

My question is, should I use '/opt' or '/usr/local/lib', or something else? Or is there some other recommended way?\n Of course, man pages could go into the corresponding system folder for auto discoverability.\n In my case, I'm using a scripting language, so my 'build' folder consists of scripts in different folders, some of which should end up in the user's path.\n Edit: Thanks everyone. I considered Bazel but I couldn't be bothered to learn its philosophy. I don't want to force autotools onto people either. I was about to push through with a makefile but I ran into 3 or 4 roadblocks derived by make's syntax or some mistakes on my part, so I decided to do as one of you suggested and use Make as a tiny interface to a bunch of bash scripts (with `set -e` for good measure) which do what I want to do.

But I truly think this may help somehow to at least new Linux users to not struggle trying to make app image apps to work as any other kind of app installed through snap or apt. \n So I made a quick bash script based repo to generate the entries and update the desktop database so the app can be found in the applications search and so on. \n For those who may find it usefull:\n appimage-desktop-integrator\n If you think it may be usefull but needs some improvements or whatever, I'll check the isues tab or this same post to fix them, and I would be very greatfull as I'm trying to get used to publish more stuff into my github repo. \n Hope this post is not useless or stupid :P\n    submitted by    /u/MrPiradoHD  \n [link]   [comments]",

Boy was I wrong...\n I have been using Linux as my daily for well over 15 years now. Mostly Ubuntu, little bit of Mint, about a year on Manjaro. I work as a software dev, but I dont want to spend my spare time fiddling much with the OS. I want it to work. Ubuntu has served me well, but snap has really been annoying lately, and some other bugs (and frustrating window management) made me explore other options.\n What can I say... popOS (22.04, nivida drivers) is just super smooth straight out of the box. It adds sensible nice little touches and tweaks on the existing base. The biggest selling point for me: The built in tiling windows feature. It is smooth, intuitive, and just works. Gnomes handling of this is behind Windows' own approach, which is a frustrating thing to conceit.\n So yea, I love popOS and I cannot wait for the fully standalone DE coming out with popOS 24.\n    submitted by    /u/red-broccoli  \n [link]   [comments]",

Mostly my question is catered towards Wine, is it the same way to install Wine or how can I install Wine to run some exes and what not? I used to have a lot of issues trying to get Wine to play some WoW back then. \n I'm aiming at using Linux Mint since I'm a bit rusty with how Linux works again and KDE might be a bit overwhelming for me, and Mint seems to have everything out of the box, specially considering I have a Nvidia GTX 1660. \n Looking forward to your responses!

I am hoping to find people that are willing to test the program. I have implemented some tests, sure, but that just means some testcases I came up with work on my machine. There are likely many obvious bugs.\n I realize, that this is not directly related to Linux, but I guess that this would be a good place to find people who are interested.

          "description": "I finally did it. Took it right out back behind the woodshed and put it down. \n It put up one hell of a fight, though. The entire time I was moving files to backup to physical medium sharedrive kept freezing up the entire system trying to do whatever and sending me constant notifications (hey! Buy more storage!). Then antimalware/ ms defender had to get in on it, too. I swear it knew what was happening because notifications started flying at me like I’ve never seen before; articles from sites I’d never heard of, stock tickers, Google drive syncs. Each moment, each pop up or little “do du do” windows sound made me more and more excited to burn it all and start fresh. \n Then I had to disable secure boot, and spent several hours debugging an old Seagate SSD that was causing all kinds of weird problems when I was flashing it, or after flashing when I was trying to boot from it. I should have guessed by the xbox logo on this thing it was going to betray me. I still don’t know what the issue was, it’s working fine as storage and every scan says it’s cool but I broke down and bought a new usb and it worked on the first try, no driver issues or compatibility mode needed, no random “can’t read from HD0.” \n Now I’m up and running on a fresh Mint Cinnamon Edge and it is beautiful, fast, clean, customizable, and light as a feather. I feel like I just took a long hot shower. I’ve been playing with settings for the last hour and looking at rices. I can’t wait to load my source code on here and start doing graphics work, compile cpp code without jumping through a bunch of hoops, and to fire up a steam game and see how it plays without a bunch of bloatware running in the background. \n I’m never touching windows again unless I have to develop for it, and I’m going to take more steps into the open source ecosystem.

          "description": "In the context of personal computers.\n As much as we'd love to see a world where everyone's PCs ship with Fedora or Mint or some other open-source, free operating system, let's be realistic here. Big hardware manufacturers want money. They WILL monetize an OS if at all possible -- Linux or not. They WILL happily preinstall an OS that pays them, if the option presents itself, and are not at all incentivized to maintain a free and open-source OS if money says otherwise.\n In a world where Linux becomes the dominant OS, what would that mean for us, the consumer?\n Would every hardware brand pull an Apple, and ship their own OS? Would an XPS run DellOS, a Galaxy Book run OneUI Linux, an HP Envy a HPOS, etc? As a hardware vendor, being able to preinstall your own locked-down operating system comes with many market pros, such as tighter hardware-software integration and easier implementation of tracking and monetization. Somewhat like the Apple style, where the Mac computer only ships with macOS.\n Or alternatively, would every brand pull a Windows? Would a single or handful of Linux distributions (say, Ubuntu) end up with enough cashflow to simply buy out the vast majority of PC vendors to include their OS preinstalled? And then get to maintain their market position due to consumer familiarity with their OS, as well as advertising/marketing revenue; meaning we'd end up in a world similar to how it is now, but with Ubuntu taking over what Windows' market role?\n    submitted by    /u/skyeyemx  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Last example to date, I'm on ubuntu, i want to install ArchiveBox. So i executed the command from the readme which is\n mkdir -p ~/archivebox/data && cd ~/archivebox/data docker run -v $PWD:/data -it archivebox/archivebox init --setup \n I get all the valid green checkmark for everything. (it's very unusual that i get all green checkmark). So felt happy that for once, at least i got an install working smoothly... (not so fast...)\n Just after executing this command, i cannot get cd, ls, or any command working anymore.\n This kind of behaviour where for whatever reason, lot of things seems broken for whatever reason. Either because of an update, or change the smallest config file or in this case installing an app. Is really what annoy me about linux in general. I've been using macos and windows for 20 years pretty intensively (installing lot of utility and apps all the times) and never had this kind of problem. But on linux (mainly ubuntu because this is what i use). It happens so often.\n Today it's \"command not found\" but tomorrow it's going to be something else on the same order of magnitude of fucking your system up. And then you have to spend hours trying to debug something you don't even know why it happens in the first place.\n Am i the only ones feeling this on linux ?\n On the pros side of linux, is that i have many apps i couldn't install on macos or windows (mainly self hosted app) that i can easily install on linux.\n Edit: the source of the bug is for whatever reason, when i installed archivebox, it changed my home folder and maybe other folder to the owner \"911\". Why ?? no idea.\n    submitted by    /u/pauldupont34  \n [link]   [comments]",

If Intel doesn’t decide to kill it any time soon, I will be a long time user from now on.\n Fedora Silverblue has been lovely, it’s very refreshing how out of my way it feels. I don’t really have to worry about some app breaking my system, and rpm-ostree has been really nice, giving me all the informations I might need to know to get some app working properly.\n Working with Homebrew has also been quite nice, I like that basically all of the packages I tried to install, just work. On Ubuntu I had issues with brew, that I don’t seem to encounter on Fedora Silverblue.\n If you’re in the market to get a new GPU or to try a new distro I genuinely recommend them.\n What are you guys’ experiences with either ARC or Silverblue?\n    submitted by    /u/crocodus  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I am interested in using Linux USB Gadget to create virtual mass storage devices for use by a host system. The idea is that by using something like btrfs on the gadget side, the host system can be snapshotted regularly and transparently, while also uploading incremental backups to a remote site even when the host is powered down. Ideally, the host system should be completely unaware that it is being served virtual drives, so the theory is then that even if the host system gets hacked or infected with something like a ransomware, then you should be able to just flip a switch to undo it. Because the malware won't be aware that it's a virtual drive. \n I obviously understand that if you create an ethernet device, then the gadget would be open to all normal network attacks, but what about USB Mass Storage? If the host system is somehow able to detect that the drive is being served by a Linux USB Gadget rather than a normal dumb USB drive, what abilities would it have to attack the gadget system?\n    submitted by    /u/jo-erlend  \n [link]   [comments]",

After all the ones who use it always go on how much better it is.\n I finally installed it in my desktop, and oh boy do I love it.\n I did very slight modifications to it, not so kuch that it will go in the “RICE” category but, I like it now.\n And boy do I love it, I have almost ditched my mouse and I prefer it, I never thought I would say that but now going back to use the mouse feels kinda cumbersome to me lol.\n It is just so damn convenient to be on the home row to do almost everything. It might not be a substantial amount of time saved but it just feels better somehow.\n I recommend more people to try it. Also not to mention, with i3 my computer uses only 200MB of RAM on idle. \n All in all I love it, would love to listen other people’s thoughts on i3.\n    submitted by    /u/Raging_PineAppleee  \n [link]   [comments]",

It would bring lot of resources to linux but it would also bring lot of toxicity im afraid. Like many not so good people would try to insert themselves and their scummy stuff into linux, infiltrating it with its bullshit, slowly poisoning it. Or maybe someone big might try to privatize it or something to overtake it. Like i cant imagine what would have happened if instead steam some other company did what they did. Or this isnt really a threat? \n Sorry if this is common topic or if its not well written, i just got my daily dose of migraine..\n Edit: I would like to add that I know you can just hop on next distro but what if the big company makes us dependent on them somehow?

For context, I started using Linux fulltime about 2 years ago but I had never printed anything using it until today. I had to print some govt-related document on our office printer. I am pretty much the only one with Linux on my personal computer in this office for software-dev purposes which is my department.\n I had to ask a colleague how to use the printer and he had no experience with anything Linux. He simply told me, go to your laptop, connect to the same wifi as the printer and click print and it should work. \n I was a bit skeptical about the experience I was about to have since I have seen a lot of doom post about printers especially on Linux but also on Windows. \n I followed his instructions and in under 2 minutes I had printed all four documents I wanted. In full color, no configs, no tweaking, no messing around with weird settings. It just worked. I was amazed and I wished most of the Linux-related spaces like gaming and editing was this easy.\n ​\n    submitted by    /u/charonTheV  \n [link]   [comments]",

I am so happy and impressed that I am going to post about it. \n I have been patiently waiting for Blender to support my AMD GPU out of the box. After the upgrade, it does.\n I have been working around a nasty bug in Gimp for years, as well. Rounding the corners of a rectangle would cause a panic crash. I think it was caused by Wayland because it didn't seem to happen under X. After the upgrade, it appears the bug is fixed.\n The only hiccup that I had was needing to uninstall libapache2-mod-php8.2. Since Ubuntu 24.04 ships with php8.3. But that was very very minor. I'm not saying that I am not going to find a major pitfall tomorrow.

It still has the KDE feel from when plasma first debuted, but everything is really nice to use. So +1 to the KDE team on a nice desktop.\n I have this on an older laptop and even managed to get Hibernate working and found a reddit post on getting hibernate on the KDE power menu. But yea, I have a background in this stuff and I still feel like hibernate should be something that gets set up by default (or at leased asked) and creates the swap partition or file and automagically gets is created, updates grub and intramfs.\n It took some time to google these things and I got it all working, but I feel its the little things like this that hold Linux back from being more widespread.\n Other than that, this is my new little laptop computer. It's circa 2011. Runs great. No need to go to the landfill just yet.\n Anywho, I'm back on a LinuxOS, feels just like I never left. Long Live Konsole.\n Edit: I haven't used desktop linux since 2010'ish or earlier. Also sorry about not knowing the KDE version differences. The release news got me to at least try Desktop linux. And I still feel happy for doing that and I've been using it now for a few days. LocalSend and KDEConnect kind of blew my mind away that I can do things that I do with my Mac and iPhone with Linux.

          "description": "Unix is a simple and elegant OS and one of its core principals is to provide mechanism and avoid unnecessary policy decision. For example Microsoft Windows has an arbitrary policy that all executable should have .exe extension. In Unix any file can be an executable as long as it has the executable bit set. This philosophy was also followed when the original X11 was designed. The X11 server only provides mechanism, the actual look and feel of the desktop, or in other words the policy was left to the Window Manager (WM). The WM is a simple application which communicates with the X11 server via ICCCM (https://www.x.org/releases/X11R7.6/doc/xorg-docs/specs/ICCCM/icccm.html ). \n With Wayland the Window Manager and compositor are lumped together as one application. These are big applications with each having their own set of bugs and very little or no cooperation between the different compositor implementation. This rigid approach is also evident in a toolkit such as GTK which insists on client-side decoration (CSD) which again is an arbitrary policy decision.\n Seems to me that we have Microsoft Windows style developers working on the future Linux desktop and it will end up being as fragile and brittle as Windows.\n    submitted by    /u/Vasant1234  \n [link]   [comments]",

And the AUR is just downloading and running a specially formatted build script (unless it's a binary package). And all of those are arguably harder to review than just downloading a shell script.\n The only proper package formats I'm aware of that do not have this issue are Flatpak and Snap. (Because sandboxing is awesome!)\n Downloading a package from someone's APT repo is just as insecure as running someone's shell script. If you trust that someone/organization, then great!

          "description": "TL;DR for anyone not wanting to read: An NVIDIA user tries Linux and encounters issues.\n Not long ago, I decided that I wanted to make the switch to Linux. So I went ahead and installed with installed the proprietary driver. However, I encountered quite a few bugs, so I tried Fedora 39 KDE, also with the proprietary driver. Unfortunately, I still had no luck. I then decided to give Arch a try, and I installed it along with KDE. Yet again, I encountered various bugs. Here are the gist of the issues I experienced with NVIDIA across all distros:\n  \nIn Wayland, resizing and moving windows wasn't a problem, but it was glitchy. Most games I tried flickered, and Chrome also glitched when resizing or during normal use.\n X11 wasn't as glitchy as Wayland, but it was extremely slow in every aspect, especially when resizing or moving windows. I tried installing the explicit sync patch from the AUR, but it didn't make a significant difference. Then I remembered that I had an Intel iGPU in my CPU, so I connected my monitors to the motherboard. After reinstalling the OS (for some reason, the iGPU didn't work unless I logged in with my monitor/s connected to the dGPU), it worked. The desktop was running on Mesa, and I was able to run games on the dGPU through prime-run. Problem solved? Absolutely not. The games started stuttering, presumably due to the whole iGPU situation. In the end, I regrettably had to switch back to Windows. The only thing preventing me from using Linux right now is the NVIDIA driver.\n  \nI want to emphasize that this is not a support post, I do not expect support. I am simply sharing my experience using Linux with an NVIDIA GPU. I genuinely don't understand how some YouTubers can claim that there are no issues with NVIDIA on Linux, with some even recommending it for certain use cases.\n    submitted by    /u/NoSeK2323  \n [link]   [comments]",

I contacted the school, explained the problem and they sent out a new laptop for him. \n The kicker comes they told me to throw it away rather than pay the money to ship it back lol so I decided to put Linux on it and rice it up and it's now actually usable. \n Slow and shitty but still usable.\n I can't imagine how much money these schools would save just by using linux.\n IF anyone knows I'm curious how much a typical school spends yearly on Microsoft and Norton licenses.\n My kids are in K12 who boast 2+ million students. That's a shit-ton of money going to Microsoft and Norton every year.\n ​\n    submitted by    /u/G_R_4_Y_AK  \n [link]   [comments]",

At this point EndeavourOS KDE (manjaro would work but don't want to install it) works quite well but on and off, not consistently enough.

          "description": "I was curious about the German competitor distro of RHEL…\n So I made an account and grabbed a 60 day trial code for the Desktop version.\n Note: This is SLE and not openSUSE Leap.\n YaST uses a different, better looking theme than the one seen on openSUSE — Black with bright green accents.\n This distro looks very premium. \n Even the default wallpaper looks way better then the one found on openSUSE. \n It’s a shame SUSE doesn’t offer a 1 year free subscription for SLE for personal use…\n Edit: They did offer a 1-year free developer subscription, but of course its no longer available…\n    submitted by    /u/SerenityEnforcer  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Does not necessarily have to be something big. Just something that was added or changed that has made your interaction with the OS, a more positive experience. Something that you notice. \n For me, it was Pixel's select text, copy links, and images from recents. \n Makes text selection super convenient and quick. You can also quickly share a link with someone right from the recents. Or copy an image to paste it somewhere else. Did not think much of it when it was first introduced, in fact, I did not like it at first, and wanted the old, predictive 5 shortcuts back. Now I find this feature so convenient that I don't know if I would be able to switch to a non-pixel phone because of it. \n Also, strangely the Media Picker introduced in Android 13. I remember before it was added, it was being hyped up, and I have to say, it has lived up to it. I use it almost daily, and I really like it. I like its UI and how it integrates third party apps too. So you can use, for example, Simple Gallery to select the image/video. It has search and convenient filtering pills for filtering media types. It's very well thought out.\n    submitted by    /u/DiplomatikEmunetey  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "坐标 029 ，最近拉了条陕西广电的 IPTV ，随线路还有一条 300M 宽带，想着可以做做联通 1000M 线路的冗余备份，顺便能折腾下陕西广电的组播源，毕竟广电的频道数量和码率吊打陕西联通。陕西联通 IPTV 就是个渣渣，频道少码率差不说，还不是单独组播线路，直播点播统统占我带宽。\n然而广电小哥拉完线路调测完并不肯告诉我光猫超级密码，这必须不能忍。网上找了一圈发现古早 B1 、B2 版本的方法在 B3 光猫跟前统统不能用，但受到之前方法的启发，发现光猫上报配置之后依然会将 useradmin 的超级密码更改为随机 4 位数字的弱密码，那就很容易穷举出来。所以思路和 B2 版本一致，但 B2 判断登陆成功与否的方式在 B3 版本上已不适用。\n通过抓包发现 B3 版本的光猫在登陆成功后会有个 302 重定向，并且尝试 3 次登陆失败后会有一个 180 秒的锁定时间，但在 3 次尝试中只要有一次正常的登陆就可以重置这个计数器。\n所以总结一下思路：\n1 、抓包分析登陆动作实现逻辑及 URL\n2 、useradmin 的密码从 0000 开始尝试至 9999 ，通过判断是否有 302 响应确定登陆成功与否\n3 、为防止 3 次登陆锁定，需要每尝试 2 次之后成功登陆一下 user 普通用户重置计数器\n随便写了段 python ，以下代码：\nimport requests\nfrom bs4 import BeautifulSoup\nimport re\n\nfor i in range(10000):\nUser_Agent = \"Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/103.0.5060.134 Safari/537.36\"\n\nheaders = {\"User-Agent\": User_Agent}\nsession = requests.Session()\n\nresponse = session.get(\"http://192.168.1.1\")\ncookies = session.cookies\n\nlogin_url = \"http://192.168.1.1/boaform/admin/formLogin\"\nif (i % 2 == 1 or i == 0):\n# 防止密码错误次数到达上限，*替换成自己光猫的 user 密码\nlogin_data = {\"username\": \"user\", \"psd\": \"********\", \"login_in\": \"%B5%C7%C2%BC\"}\nsession.post(login_url, login_data, allow_redirects=False)\nlogout_url = \"http://192.168.1.1/boaform/admin/formLogout\"\nsession.post(logout_url, allow_redirects=False)\n# 尝试以 useradmin 及 4 位数字密码登陆\nlogin_data = {\"username\": \"useradmin\", \"psd\": \"{:04d}\".format(i), \"login_in\": \"%B5%C7%C2%BC\"}\nres = session.post(login_url, login_data, allow_redirects=False)\n\n# 检查是否有 302 重定向\nif res.status_code == 302:\nprint(\"Login succeeded with password:\", \"{:04d}\".format(i))\nbreak\nelse:\nprint(\"Login failed for password:\", \"{:04d}\".format(i))\n\n懒得优化了，能跑就行\n\n\n这下看起来舒服多了，随手翻翻 WAN 线路配置\n\n\n那就不客气了，必须桥接走起\n\n\n\n还真给翻到了\n\n那不客气了，vlan 号懒得改就随手用它的，反正屋里多这俩也不冲突。\n\niptv 组播源改天再折腾吧\n\n以上，有陕西广电的兄弟可以参考一下。",

          "description": "这是一个信息过载的时代，也是一个信息匮乏的时代。\n这种矛盾的现象在 Python 编程语言上的表现非常明显。\n它是常年高居编程语言排行榜的最流行语言之一，在国外发展得如火如荼，开发者、项目、文章、播客、会议活动等相关信息如海如潮。\n但是，形成鲜明对比的是，它在国内的就业形势一片黯淡，开发者数量与知识社区常年都萎靡不振（除了培训机构的广告满天飞）。\n国内 Python 社区与西方主流社区存在着巨大的信息差。我多年持续观察，对此感受颇深，这里从两个较为直观的维度能看出差距有多大：\n文章的数量。国内做得最好的技术平台是掘金（除公众号不好统计外，其它都差一大截），Python 分类下每天的文章数基本不超过 20 篇；国外的平台有 Medium 、DEV 社区、Hashnode 、Reddit 等，每一个都能压掘金一筹。至于 Python 类个人博客，那就更不用提了\n播客的数量。国内只有“捕蛇者说”一株独苗，更新的内容和频率都很佛系；国外的播客非常多，2019 年有篇文章介绍了 27 个，如今只会更多，我记得在去年的 Python 潮流周刊里就介绍过 4 档新的播客\n除此之外，还有开源项目、社区活动、公司招聘、以及最最重要的是创造出这些东西的贡献者，感觉那一边是璀璨若繁星，而这一边微似点点流萤。\n为了弥补这一信息差距，我创办了“Python 潮流周刊”。\n周刊自 2023 年 5 月连载至今，到下一期就是第 50 期了，时间正好是一周年！\n我过去有些疑虑，不知道自己能坚持更新多久，对于内容和运营手段也没有考虑得太清楚，因此，既没有写下过什么“创刊语”，也没有好好向大家推销过。\n在《技术周刊的转变：如何平衡热爱与现实？》里，我解释了为什么会转向付费专栏。经过最近几期的试运行，正好遇上周岁生日的节点，于是，我决定就从第 50 期开始（预计时间为 5 月 12 日），让我们开启一段新的旅程…",

          "description": "看到帖子跳出自己的舒适圈，想到了最近三年来自己改变掉的一些习惯，帮助自己提升了许多，跟大家分享一下。\n学会标准指法和双拼。毕业之前一直没有用标准指法，打字最早是二指禅，后来慢慢形成自己的手指映射习惯，但一些按键盲打很容易按错，临近毕业的时候下决心学了标准指法，大概一周的时间完全适应，两周的时间已经比原先的盲打要快很多了。有了这一次成功改变习惯的经历后，很快下决心学习双拼输入法，一个月内达到了之前的打字速度，现在比之前也更快了。\n学会 vim 的键位，接触 neovim 并配置完整的前端开发环境。上学的时候曾经短暂接触过 vim ，因为那时候有一个课程设计的作业需要在一个命令行界面的虚拟机中编写代码，只会 hjkl 和 i 。在标准指法和双拼熟练后，我有信心学会 vim 的绝大部分常用操作，毕竟我自身也很认可用 vscode 写代码的时候，切换键盘和鼠标是一件很麻烦的事情。这件事当然也成功了，虽然 neovim 并没有深入研究（使用了 astro nvim 的方案）。目前使用 vscode+vim 插件，配合把 astro nvim 的一些按键映射到 vscode 的命令，加上 easy motion ，现编辑代码明显能更快跟上我的脑子了。\n习惯 Mac 的快捷键。从大部分 Mac 和 Windows 都有客户端的软件来看，Mac 看起来像是把 Windows 的 Ctrl 键拆分成了一部分 Command 和一部分 Control 。工作后公司配的电脑是 Mac ，所以不得不开始熟悉 Mac 的使用。最开始我会纠结，是不是要统一双端的快捷方式，但有了相信自己的习惯可以改变的信念后，我还是坚持 Mac 上就用 Mac 的一套，Windows 上就用 Windows 的一套。实践下来其实同时拥有两套对 Ctrl 按键的认知，是不会有什么问题的，只要你足够相信自己，时间长了你既能熟悉 Mac 也能熟悉 Windows 。\n主要的就是这三个例子，其余还有很多小的事情，总之，当我第一件事情成功之后，我逐渐建立起这种信念，无论多么坚固的习惯都是可以被改变的。而这个信念的强大之处就在于，它可以让你开始练习形成一个新的，对你更好的习惯。这个信念比那些什么 21 天养成习惯的鸡汤，或者各种提醒 app 都更有用。相信自己可以做到，就真的能够做到。\n分享这些希望大家能够相信自己想要改变的一些习惯是真的可以改掉的，然后动手努力去让改变发生。\n也欢迎大家分享自己成功改变习惯/形成习惯的例子。",

          "description": "最近 Netflix 打击合租账号，但是我看到基本上 Apple TV 合租仍然没有受到影响。基于这个情况，产生以下几个疑问，希望大佬们帮忙解答一下：\n1. 安卓盒子合租受影响，但是 Apple TV 合租不受影响的原因是什么？是因为 Apple 对于用户的隐私保护比较到位，导致 Netflix 看不到用户 IP ，还是因为 Netflix 无法区分 Apple TV ，iPhone 和 iPad 的用户？\n2. 亚马逊的 Fire TV Cube 和 Fire TV Stick 4K Max 是不是因为基于安卓盒子的魔改，也受到了 Netflix 对于合租的限制？\n3. 如果因为就是想参加 Netflix 合租的想法而去入手 Apple TV ，现在还是个好时机吗？还是说，Netflix 的合租限制接下来也会包括 Apple TV ？\n谢谢各位大佬的指点！",

It's an open source data anonymization and synthetic data generation platform called Neosync, you can check out the github here. The idea is that you can use Neosync to :\nanonymize sensitive data so it’s safe for developers to use in stage, dev, local, etc.\nsync data across environments - including subsetting with full referential integrity\ngenerate synthetic data for better debugging, testing and feature development\nWe've gotten good feedback from teams that have sensitive data (whether it's GDPR, DPDP in india, PII, PHI, etc.).\nAlso have some devops teams using it to just easily sync data across multiple environments that are separated by VPCs without using PGDUMP. We support postgres, mysql and s3 today and building support for mongodb.\nWould love any feedback that folks have!",

          "description": "前几天，穿了很久的鞋子脏了，要洗了。鉴于之前在福奈特洗过一次，感觉体验还不错，上门拿货，洗完后上门送鞋子，很方便，鞋子洗涤的也比较干净。但是感觉还是有点小贵，所以这次在美团上面找了一家便宜洗鞋店，50 快 2 双鞋子 。当时没感觉有什么问题，遂下单让快递师傅来拿鞋子了。故事开始了。\n\n今天拿到鞋子了，两双 puma 的反毛皮休闲鞋。打开包裹，发现一双鞋子没洗干净，同时反毛皮面也没有了绒毛，还比较硬。遂与美团店家沟通，拍照然后商议赔偿，当时只是感觉洗的不干净。不说过程，最后店家出一双洗鞋的钱，店家索要了支付宝账号和姓名，我当时感觉有点不对，但是也没多想。\n\n距离小区几百米有个洗鞋店，我只想重新洗一下。到店里跟老板开始攀谈起来，老板说你这鞋子反毛皮洗废了。都没绒毛了，表面硬硬的，当时气就上来了，感觉鞋子洗坏赔偿要少了。一回想，发现美团洗鞋的店家也把我套路了，退款没走官方渠道（不知道是否合法），还拿到了我的个人信息，手机号和姓名。我后来又问美团店主，他说订单完结，只能走线下，这里表示疑惑 。\n\n到附近的洗衣店跟老板攀谈了一会，老板说鞋子能修复修复，于是又花了 50 快，让洗衣店老板帮忙修复下，事情到这里告一段落。\n我想到的经验教训：\n1.洗鞋子不要贪图便宜，尽量选择大的连锁店。洗之前一定拍照固定下证据，以防他们给你洗坏了，不好维权。发现如果洗的有问题，不知道坏不坏，就找个线下的店,借洗鞋子名义让他们给你评判下。\n2.注意个人隐私，我感觉他们是故意这样搞的。有你手机号码和姓名，如果你搞事，他们就会搞你。这次我信息已经泄露了,我选择交学费。",

          "description": "1 、新显示器 DP 接口 v1.4 ，用的是 40 多块的秋叶原 DP v1.4 线材，发生窗口卡顿的时候的时候我在看电影，用的是 PotPlayer + LAV Filters + Bluesky Frame Rate Converter + RX 580 硬解 ，并且是用鼠标来回拖拽进度条，这时候影片卡顿，音画不同步，同时 PotPlayer 程序崩溃。Win 10 卡顿的表现现象是拖曳 Win 10 的计算器，会发现窗口一顿一顿的，鼠标箭头都出现了重影，有两个箭头，这时如果插拔显示器 DP 线或者关闭再打开显示器就恢复正常，这种故障不定时复现，并且 Win 10 日志只记载了 PotPlayer 崩溃引起的 Application Hang 错误。\n2 、上面的这种配置我用老显示器和这条秋叶原 DP 线材是有卡顿的，但是卡顿的表现现象不同，就是有时候同时开 Brave 浏览器和 Vivaldi 浏览器的时候发生的整个 Win 10 系统卡住了，鼠标都动得非常非常慢，必须关闭一种浏览器才能恢复，但再同时开这两种浏览器的话 ，整个 Win 10 又卡住了，必须重启才能完全正常，看了 Win 10 日志也是啥都没显示 。重点是老显示器是没有上面这种新的显示器连拖曳 Win 10 计算器都发生卡顿的。\n3 、显卡驱动没有发生崩溃，所以也没重装显卡驱动。我现在换上原装 DP 线材在试用中，还没重现故障，我想问的是这种故障表现是偏硬件还是偏软件？是 LG 27uq850v 显示器故障还是 Win10 系统故障？\nps：买了新显示器后同时装了 IVPN 程序，怀疑是它引起故障，刚卸载了，现在试用原装 DP 线材中，争取在 七天无理由退货期中的剩下几天中及时发现问题。",

          "description": "想问一下，大家做国外远程，直接和公司签的多吗，还是通过某个 IT 中介/人头公司签？ 按我的了解就是大公司一般都会让很多中介公司去放招聘，（所以像一些职位你去大公司搜不到，因为他们本身也没有 hc ，就打算跟 IT 服务公司签服务合同而已）同时大公司也不能直接和个人签合同，就算是短期的合同工，都需要和公司之间交易，所以我猜这也是中介公司能存活的原因，对客户也好，对个人也方便，省去客户公司很多 legal 或者报税的东西。=如果真要跳过中介的话，一般个人要去注册个公司，然后用这个公司接受客户公司的打款（小红书上看到过一个帖子）\n那现在我的问题是，如果对于客户公司是可以直接和个人签合同工的话，一开始是由中介公司带来的，毕竟中介公司的猎头花了时间去帮客户公司去招人。那以后客户公司如果有意直接吸引这个人，直接跟这个人签合同，少了中介在中间抽成，这样客户少出点钱，个人也能多收点。但是我听说这样中介公司可能 charge 这个客户的人头费或者有别的 legal 问题，所以是否中介跟客户当初的协议里就包括了某种协议防止这样情况，有的话可以如何绕开吗？\n还有个好奇的话，大家国外远程的话，大家薪资最高到哪？大家可以分享下吗，让我羡慕下",

          "description": "服务器是阿里云买的一个 2 核 2G 的 ECS ，没有开通什么高防，因为收费和不知道其原理的原因（怕超量扣很多钱），所以我现在连什么情况都不知道，我估计是大量的接口请求导致的，因为 CPU 飙升 100%，之前都是 2%到 3%。\n我目前是关掉了域名解析，服务器重启，暂避锋芒，不关掉解析 CPU 掉不下来。然后现在正常了。\n我目前主要倒不是生气，倒有点觉得技不如人，可能是没有对我造成太大的损失，那产品就没几个用户，真不知道攻击者想啥，但大概率攻击者是用户之一。我想请问有什么书籍可以让我对 Web 防护有一些策略吗，我趁此机会好好学习一下。另外感谢那位哥只攻击了我一个域名。\n另外我还想问问，这种请求攻击是不是就是无解？我目前想到的是短时间禁掉高频访问的 ip ，就是 tcp/ip 流量进来我就给那个 ip 给 close 了，这个有用吗？说实话这种攻击我感觉挺无力的，除了攻击者不想搞事了，还有一种办法就是进局子了，不然没完没了。\n至于具体的情况，是不是我说的请求攻击，我会先问一下阿里云那面，也希望攻击者歇歇，不然真得报警了。最后，求书，求点策略，我是搞 java 的，但这里好像并不用限定这个开发语言。",

          "description": "我有个一直在做的通知网关项目 Heimdallr，这几天 star 多了很多，发现在什么值得买有个博主介绍了我的项目，然后在评论里发现有人提到，配置太多了，看不明白。\n我之前一直想做一个前端页面来进行配置的管理，但是这个项目的首要考虑之一就是“轻量”，所以没有使用数据库，也不想做 CRUD （多没意思）。同时，我本身是后端，对前端的理解仅停留在会写一点点 HTML 和 CSS ，所以一直很没有动手写过完整的前端网站。针对配置管理，朋友给了我一个灵感——一个生成 nginx 配置的网站。\n做一个前端页面来生成配置就好了！趁热打铁，我花了大概十个多小时，通过和 GitHub Copilot 合作，上线了一个前端网站 —— Heimdallr Configurator，如下。它的功能就是在左侧编辑通知渠道和分组，右侧同步生成可以直接使用的配置文件，提供复制和导出功能。\n \n以下是一些我总结的技巧：\n你来指路，他来解决细节\n我一直觉得 Copilot 这个名字取得很好，它的角色不是代替程序员进行编写，而是在程序员的指导下完成繁复的部分。作为机长，你需要了解你的目的地，以及途中经过的路标——对应地，你需要知道最终完成的效果，以及如何分步去完成。\n在我的例子里，我知道需要先把页面分成左右两栏，左边做一个 tab ，底下一列卡片，每个卡片里放一个表单；右边做一个文本框和几个按钮，文本框实现同步左边表单变动生成配置内容，按钮实现复制、导出和重置功能等。将步骤拆分好后，再通过 Copilot 逐个去实现。\n选对上下文，事半功倍\nCopilot Chat 有一个选择上下文的功能，在光标没有选中文本时，上下文取当前窗口可见的行，选中了文本时，上下文为选中的文本（可以选中整个文件的全部文本），但是不能跨文件获取上下文。\n当你不选择上下文时，Copilot 往往没法给出很具体的建议，它只会给出几个可能的原因。如果你碰巧不熟悉，一个个排查会浪费很多时间。如果你选择的上下文不对，Copilot 无法从中判断到有效信息，它会提示你，这时候重新选择，然后追问即可。在你不知道 bug 在哪里的情况下，可以先选中一段可能有问题的地方，描述问题，如果它表示这里没问题，再选择另一段追问即可。\n给清晰指令，避免误解\n尽量用简短的技术语言去描述你的需求，而不是自然语言。虽然大模型的能力能让它大致能理解“外行发言”，但正确的术语能避免它第一次给出的结果不满意的情况。例如上面写布局的例子，如果不指定使用 Tailwind CSS ，它给出的例子很可能是用原生的 CSS 写的。\n另外，我个人建议使用英文与 Copilot Chat 交流，个人觉得交流起来更加方便、精准。而且有时候你跟它说中文，回答可能还是英文。\n写好注释，面向自然语言编程\n在代码比较简单的时候，也可以不用 Copilot Chat ，直接打注释。\n篇幅有限，具体示例可以移步我的博客查看： https://ameow.xyz/archives/develop-a-frontend-site-with-copilot\n如果你对文中提到的项目感兴趣，这里是它们的地址。\nGitHub - LeslieLeung/heimdallr: 一个非常轻量的通知网关，可以聚合各种推送渠道，使用 Serverless 部署，几乎零成本运行。\nGitHub - LeslieLeung/heimdallr-configurator",

          "description": "一开始用的 oneNote ，因为跟 office 配套，所以自然而然的用了 3 年多。oneNote 可以创建无限个标签，同时标签里可以创建无限个页，页可以嵌套无限个子页，每一页的内容也是可以无限扩展的，这在当时非常惊艳，也有各种大神做出了很精美的日记页面。\n我一度为了这个软件，买了当时微软最火的硬件 surface ，在 surface 上 oneNote 是最好用的。因为 surface 支持手写，我很享受在电子设备上有书写的感觉。\n但是它也有几个致命的缺点，我用的是桌面版，微软后来莫名其妙的砍掉了，新功能比如 markdown 不再支持，二是由于国内同步速度一直是个迷，有时候快，有时候很慢，不得不依赖于第三方的同步方案，例如坚果云才能勉强实现多端同步，遂逐渐放弃。\n有道云笔记\n工作之后就开始转向国产笔记软件了，用了大概 5 年的有道云笔记。界面很清爽，基本没有任何广告，让人觉得这软件只能用来记笔记，简单高效。操作习惯符合国人，当时它的网页插件有道云笔记剪辑很好用，在一个网页上直接点击，文章就会被保留格式并自动同步在笔记里。同时多端同步速度很快，电脑上编辑的，手机上能很快显示出来。\n但是用久了发现也有一些问题，5 年前的文章再打开，页面很慢，内容长时间才响应，剪辑功能逐渐不好用了，基本是无响应的状态，文章查看不方便，只能是一个文件夹一个文件夹的去找。\n这样的困惑，让我很长时间都没有记录新的内容了，找不到合适的载体，就不想记录，而且现在记录的越多，以后迁移就越麻烦。直到去年接触了笔记软件 obsidian ，我才发现找到了新的天地。\nmarkdown 格式\nobsidian 用的是 markdown 格式的，我用这个软件前，没接触过 markdown ，直到用了几次后，才发现它很简单，就是一种格式。格式会体现在文件的后缀上，比如图片一般是 jpg,png 格式的，电影是 mp4,mkv 格式的，像之前的 oneNote 用的 one 格式的，有道云笔记的文件我没有找到。\n在我看来，markdown 有两大好处\n一是上手简单，它有自己的语法，但是你不必完全掌握，一上来你可以就把它当做是一个记事本来写，非常简单。当你需要什么功能时，比如要有小标题，比如文本高亮，再去找相应的语法。语法也非常简单，因为它是标记语言，所以几个标签就能解决问题。\n二是这个格式是通用的，意味着迁移成本很低。上文说到的格式问题，各个软件公司都不通用，都有自己的专门格式。如果哪一天你要换个笔记软件，如果你在这个软件上有上千篇的文章，迁移过程只能手动，或者看看有没有大神有对应的脚本，没有的话非常低效，会让人崩溃。而 markdown 不存在这个问题，即使有一天这个 obsidain 软件公司倒闭了，我也能很快迁移到另一个软件上，比如 typora ，笔记内容很快就能显示出来。\n本地\n放在本地的好处是，一是加载快，直接读取本地的内容，而不必通过网络请求，尤其是在你网络不好的情况下，就会出现页面内容显示时间过长的尴尬。我之前用过一段时间的 notion,在网络很好的情况下，能很快打开内容，而在网络不好，页面长时间不响应，当你想快速查找一个内容的时候，内容显示不出来，这任谁都忍受不了。\n第二个是隐私的问题，不管是有道云笔记，还是 oneNote ，都是放在别人的服务器上，尤其是一些国产的服务器，会存在对应的审核，比如语雀创建笔记或者是分享给别人的时候会提示正在审核中，有时候就会提示分享失败，如果审核认为你存在敏感内容，就会删除对应的内容甚至是对应的笔记。如果记录的是一些教程或者是工作笔记，看就看了，当我们写一些私密性的东西，肯定不想被别人看到吧。",

          "description": "经常看到有人抱怨安卓手机屏幕色彩过于饱和，或感觉看上去没有苹果的自然。可看各家官网，明明都在宣传屏幕素质如何如何高，那这是为何呢？这其中的直接原因就是大部分安卓手机的屏幕色彩模式默认还在用鲜艳模式。\n请在设置里找到色彩模式，华为、荣耀选择「标准」，小米、vivo 、OPPO 选择「专业」。这样设置后屏幕色域会提升，能更真实地还原广色域图片本来的色彩，色准往往也会更好，安卓的色彩管理还比较乱，但实测肉眼整体观感都会好很多。除了各家旗舰外，我甚至测试了一台千元机荣耀 X50 ，如此设置后都感觉屏幕素质瞬间高级（标准）了。\n如果你已经在用鲜艳模式，刚开始设置后可能会觉得色彩变得太寡淡，以及屏幕「变黄了」。可以尝试适应一段时间看看，若不能适应，主动选择鲜艳模式也无可厚非，但让屏幕正确而非艳丽地显示内容才应该是默认选项。\n另外，这点也同样适用于相机。各家也都有相应的色彩模式，有的更真实，有的更鲜艳。与安卓相比，iPhone 的屏幕色准和色彩管理一直是行业标杆，倒是相机色彩近些年为了迎合市场也变得稍微更鲜艳了，且没有模式可以选择。",

          "description": "之前上学时认识了几个喜欢折腾电脑的同学，他们没有电脑所以只能靠手机连接到远程桌面服务器来折腾电脑，于是我就在学校的服务器上弄了一个虚拟机来让他们轮流使用（虚拟机的配置不高所以只能轮流）。轮流使用，一不小心就把另一个人给挤出来了，几经折腾就形成了现在的可申请的服务器，期间我又是自学 PHP 又是自学批处理之类的。\n我们都毕业之后显然不能继续用学校的服务器来跑这些东西，然后家里宽带尚可的同学就买了个工控机继续跑这套玩具，一来确实还有人要用二来有情怀。\n它的使用流程是，在登录页面输入 QQ 号以及想要用来登录服务器的密码，然后在申请服务器时，系统会发邮件来确认 QQ 邮箱主人的身份免得被滥用还找不到主。这个网站还提供了下载远程桌面连接配置文件的功能，就不用手动输入计算机名用户名之类的信息了。其余的一些操作，我不用说，看一眼你们都会。\n需要注意的是，我们都是视障者（盲人），对，一点都看不见那种，网页设计得只能算可以使用，毫无美关可言，所以你可以选择不用但请别骂。网页简陋到什么程度呢，一些提示信息是直接以浏览器消息对话框的形式呈现的，更多的是显示一个全屏页面，消息文本显示在屏幕正中间，要确认消息就直接点击消息，不得不说这样弄，挺方便盲人的，但看得见的就会觉得非常不可理喻。\n关于隐私权的问题，这个服务本来就是公开可用的，而且还没设置自动还原，所以请不要在上面登录任何私密账号或者存储和处理私密信息，否则被盗我也真没办法。\n不管你们是需要使用，还是纯粹好奇，我都欢迎你们体验： https://viyf.de/vs",

          "description": "什么是新流系列软件\n当下越来越多的应用搬到了云上，这给用户带来了方便，但也带来了一些问题。\n第一，用户的数据和隐私安全问题。云上的应用，数据和应用的控制权由软件厂商牢牢把控，用户在软件厂商面前如同裸奔，对用户的数据和隐私安全的保护，全靠软件厂商的良心。大家知道，国内的软件厂商通常是没有良心的。国外的可能有点，但也不多。\n第二，没完没了的付费问题。云上的应用走的都是互联网的老套路，先免费，等到你被平台深度绑定的时候，再收费。不交钱？那就加广告，再各种限制你，反正有的是办法。订阅制的付费模式，只要你还在使用，就要一直付费，长期来看，使用成本还是很高的。\n新流系列软件是对软件模式的一种新的探索，它的目标是在用户的数据和隐私保护，跨设备使用便利性，以及软件使用成本上取得一种平衡，给用户更多一种的选择。\n简单来说，新流系列软件遵循三条新流软件标准\n第一，不注册，不联网，本地存储，离线运行，是完全的本地应用程序。用户拥有对数据和软件绝对的控制权，用户的数据和隐私安全也有绝对的保障。\n第二，支持 Windows 、macOS 、Linux 、iOS 、Android 、Web 等几乎所有主流平台。通过新流互联，支持在任意平台间进行应用流转和数据流转。\n第三，拒绝订阅制，告别没完没了的付费。一次付费，所有平台永久使用，永久可用。\n关于新流密码\n新流密码是一个密码管理应用，它完全遵循了新流软件的三大标准，本地存储，离线运行，多平台支持，跨设备访问。买断制，相对订阅制也能很好的降低用户的使用成本，特别是对于密码管理这种使用频度很低的应用来说。\n在功能上，新流密码支持多账号，方便小号管理。支持安全密码生成，支持查看密码历史。对了，还支持添加附件，这在保存一些证书，密钥时会非常有用。\n在进行跨平台访问时，对数据的点对点传输都进行了加密，以保证数据安全性。\n在使用上，建议用户将应用安装到手机上，当需要跨平台使用时，通过新流互联，将应用流转到其他平台上进行使用。\n关于新流互联，新流互联支持基于局域网或者 IPV6 公网内的跨设备访问，支持DDNS 动态域名绑定，通过自定义域名访问设备。（根据我的观察，目前手机蜂窝网络分配到的已经是 IPV6 地址了，家庭宽带也都基本支持 IPV6 。）\n为什么想写一个密码管理应用\n还记得很多年以前，我只有一个银行卡密码。再后来有了电脑以后，就是几个社交账号论坛的密码。再到后来互联网流行了以后，各种密码也是越来越多了。直到最近几年，特别是云计算流行了以后，什么东西都上了云了，就什么东西都变成了账号密码了。。。\n密码越来越多以后，忘记密码的事情就时有发生。于是就用了 LastPass ，我把我所有的密码都放在了上面。其实我也不怎么用它，平时我都是登录以后就记住密码的。只有在换了新设备或者重装系统以后，偶尔登上去，查一下密码。这个 LastPass 安不安全我不好说，但是因为是国外的软件，每次登录都特别的慢，而且只要换了 IP 登录，就要验证邮箱，非常繁琐。最近几年更是经常爆出被黑的新闻，心里总还是有点担心的。于是就有了今天的新流密码。\n大概就是这样了吧，相关截图和下载地址可以访问 新流软件官网: https://www.xinflow.cn",

          "description": "去年年底的时候，本着「鸡蛋不能放在同一个篮子」的想法，开始陆陆续续将此前在 小红书 上的内容同步到 Humanitech 的同名 Telegram 频道，并有幸与（也许是）最大的中文 IT 频道「 Newlearnerの自留地」达成合作，每周定期同步内容发送，因此吸引了第一批读者。\n比起小红书上「铺天盖地」的数据反馈，在 Telegram 创作大部分时候都像是朝空气挥拳——这并非是指你所发布的内容毫无意义，而是少有回应。——这也是为什么许多有趣的 Telegram 频道最后都以停更告终的原因。\n但也正是因为没有算法的推波助澜，在 Telegram 创作反而给予每一位创作者完全的自我与自由：你不再需要考虑是否存在敏感词导致限流，也不需要用感叹号吆喝读者注意，你所需要做的，往往是在笔记 App 中以「读者只有你自己」的心态完成创作，然后发布。\n从另一个角度上来说，同步内容至 Telegram 频道的这几个月来，也在一定程度上缓解了我在小红书上的数据焦虑。这一方面是摆烂心理作祟，「 Telegram 的浏览量都才几百，小红书笔记一千出头已经非常不错了！」；另一方面则是我逐渐从「小红书笔记同步到 Telegram 频道」转为「 Telegram 内容『移植』到小红书」，当我发现自己不再在写完文本后的第一时间上查词网站审核修改时，我知道小红书那些驯化无数创作者为流量生、为数据死的做法对我来说已经没有什么作用了。\n写这些并不是呼应大家杯葛小红书，事实上对创作者来说，它仍然是能够触及到更多读者、对素人最为友好的一个途径。就像我现在也仍然在小红书上活跃，但不同的是，它对我来说只是千千万万的内容分发平台之一，仅此而已。\n最后，如果你对数码产品感兴趣，也欢迎去 Humanitech 的 [Telegram 频道]( https://t.me/humanitech 踩踩转转。就像在简介中提到的一样，希望它能成为你在广阔数字世界的一扇小窗。",

          "description": "公司经营不好，钱有一点，不知道多少。原本是过年发 2 个月年终奖和工资的，但是过年前老板突然说没钱了，年终发不出来，工资也没有。\n然后等到了 2 月 10 号发工资日，没发出来，回去的时候等到了 3 月 10 号，也没发出来，就在 3 月 13 号自己走被迫离职了，公司的人走了一大半，还有一些人没走，被老板留下来了，但是降薪了。\n这里写个插曲，公司很多同事直接签了离职协议，老板之前口头说是肯定会还你工资的，可以签欠条，但是实际是别的同事签了离职协议，约定“甲方承诺，在甲方在经营好转情况下，甲方逐步支付乙方拖欠的工资。乙方不得再因为原劳动合同的履行和解除向甲方及其关联机构主张其他任何权利（包括但不限于报酬、费用、赔偿或补偿）”，就是后来得知这条我直接去走了劳动监察。老板真无耻，大家都在同情他了，还要过河拆桥，我因为走了被迫，所以没有签协议。\n然后前天劳动监察下来了，发了限期支付劳动报酬通知书，但是三天过去了老板也没找我说这事，那么就很明显，他选了无视这个监察。今天我问了同事，说是一些款下来了，应该是拿这些给留下来的同事发工资。\n那么我想问问大家，后续我怎么走呢？我打算明天去劳动局拿到通知书的复印本，看看是否约定了具体的还款期限，同时，直接去提起劳动仲裁，待受理后，我打算冻结公司账户，这样子做可行吗？后续如果劳动监察通知到期企业没有付款，那么我就去凭借这个回执去法院走支付令，如果支付令下来了公司还无动于衷，我打算走强制执行，或者追究拒不支付劳动报酬罪的法律责任。",

          "description": "2023 年 1 月 20 号那天突发奇想：日子过得这么快，能不能写点什么记录下来，能留住一些时光，以后年纪大了也好有个回忆？于是从那一天开始写日记，到今天为止，写了 365 篇记录，大概的字数在 40 万字左右。\n初衷\n读小学的时候爸爸就要求我写日记了，初中时也写过一段时间，高中的时候在寝室里，等外面熄灯了，我躲在被子里，左手拿着手电筒和撑着被子，右手就在那写。不过都有一个共同点，都没有坚持下来，断断续续的写了一段时间就停了，等再次捡起来时已经过去了好几年。\n最近想做一个 365 计划，就从写日记开始，坚持写 365 天？一方面圆了小时候的一个愿望，做一件想做但是很久没做的事，又能实现计划的第一步。于是乎，就从这天开始了，我就开始写了。\n坚持\n有人会说从去年 1 月 20 号到今天 3 月 30 号，已经过了 14 个月 10 天，435 天，怎么你才写 365 篇呢，你不是一天写一篇吗？去年有段时间我没有写，或者哪一天太忙了我也没写。对于强迫症来说，这个是不是不完美了，日记没有坚持天天写是失败的？以前我还真是这么想的，现在我的想法是作为一个打工族，每天除了忙于工作，也有很多其他的事要处理，怎么可能坚持每天都写？但如果能尽我所能，尽量每天都写，保持总体的目标是 365 篇，而且尽可能用比较短的时间，而不是用十年，二十年去完成这个不是特别困难的目标，那为什么要计较一天两天没写呢？抱着这样的想法，直到今天终于完成了属于我的小目标。\n同时围绕着这个小目标，我尽力把每一天的事做好，平时让我写 1 万字，我都有点发怵，但是日积月累下来，没想到有这么多。我有个朋友跟我说，你这字数都可以去出书了，确实，一般的书大部分都是在 20 万，40 万左右的，我说还不行，我这废话太多了，属于废话文学。\n内容\n平均每天写了 1000 多字，有那么多写的吗？刚开始写，觉得一切很新奇，也有很多话可以对自己说，但是写一段时间就会腻或者从一开始就没什么写的。\n但我觉得，既然已经决定开始写日记了，那么最重要的是把它当成你的朋友，敞开心扉，有什么事都可以对它说，你白天的工作，你伤心的事，难过的事，开心的事，后悔的事，即将完成的事，想要去做的事，你心中的善念，或者你心中的恶，即使是流水账，都可以说出来，这样内容就会多很多。\n写日记的工具\n最开始我是用有道云笔记写的，但从去年 4 月份开始接触 obsidian 后，便逐渐所有的内容全都转到了这上面来。因为格式是通用的，markdown 形式，就算不用这个软件，也可以很轻松的换到 typora 或者其他，而像 onenote 或者有道，都是独家的格式，很麻烦。第二个是这个文件保存在本地，没有存在云上面，打开很快，而且没有隐私困扰。我自己一直放在本地或者放在我信任的云服务或者 nas 上。\n时间和地点\n最开始的时候我一直用 mac 写，有时候很忙，很难抽得出时间坐在写字桌上，就用手机写。手机最大的好处就是随时随地，方便了，我曾经在火车上写过，在等人的时候写过，在路边写过，在咖啡厅里写过，甚至在旅游途中也在写。用《那些年》的一句台词就是我就是在不停的战斗。最近我换了一下云存储，改用 onedrive 了，所以写作的主力变成了家里的台式机。大屏加上机械键盘，写起来就是更方便，更给力，缺点就是只能在家里这么用了。\n刚开始那段时间早上开始写，我通常第二天写前一天的事，有点像回忆录，优点是能够清楚的了解所有发生的事，不会发生诸如中午把日记写完，结果下午或者晚上有了更加值得的事去记录。白天和晚上都有写过，区别是白天心态更加平和，写起来更加客观，能够奋笔疾书，晚上的话人比较感性，思绪万千，容易不在状态。\n有什么用\n写那么多字或者坚持这么多天，有什么用？借用《让子弹飞》里的一句话，正经人谁写日记啊，用这么多时间还不如去打把王者。\n写这个有什么用呢？我也不知道有什么用，喜欢打游戏有什么用？能拿冠军吗？喜欢打篮球有什么用？能进 NBA 吗？大部分人都是普通人吧，应该很难达到上述的目标，但是做不到这些就不会去打游戏了吗，不会去打篮球了吗？\n人生有什么意义？我也不知道有什么意义，可能有一小部分时间属于我们自己，可以做一些自己想做的事情的时候，就很有意义了。每天打工，每天加班，并不是我们想要的生活。\n话说回来，写日记有什么用呢？我感觉最直观的用途就是如果突然提起去过哪里，我能很快通过日记找出那天，重温一下那天的记忆，有点像录像回放，最直观的功能了。",

          "description": "去年9月，我曾经制定了一个“豆瓣250观影计划”，打算完成一个之前十多年我都没完成的小计划：看完“豆瓣250”的全部电影，今天我终于完成了这个计划，看完了豆瓣250的全部250部电影。\n\r\n\r\n数据统计\n\r\n\r\n根据豆瓣生成的观影记录统计，我看的第一部豆瓣250电影是从2007年10月开始，至今历时16年6个月，总共的观看时长为514个小时。\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n这250部电影中，有43部日韩电影，27部港台电影，17中国大陆电影，163部欧美电影和其他地区电影。\n\r\n\r\n我的打分里，一共给68部电影打5星，175部电影打4星，7部电影打3星。\n\r\n\r\n我的打分标准\n\r\n\r\n早期看电影不多的时候，我给电影打分比较随意，经常出现打分变化的情况，后来，我总结了一个量化打分的小技巧，通过这个方法，对于电影的评分进行较为准确的评估。\n\r\n\r\n我的打分方法是，看完一部电影之后，我会问自己一个问题：这部电影，你还想看第2遍吗？\n\r\n\r\n1、我给电影打5星的标准是：\n\r\n\r\n（1）这部电影我想立刻看第2遍、第3遍、第4遍……\n\r\n\r\n（2）这部电影感动得我落下泪水。\n\r\n\r\n（3）这部电影让我陷入长时间的思考。\n\r\n\r\n2、打4星的标准是：\n\r\n\r\n电影还行，如果有时间，可能会看第2遍。\n\r\n\r\n3、打3星的标准是：\n\r\n\r\n看一遍就够了，不会再看了。\n\r\n\r\n4、打2星的标准是：\n\r\n\r\n看了一半，看不下去了。\n\r\n\r\n5、打1星的标准是：\n\r\n\r\n只看了开头几分钟，就看不下去了。\n\r\n\r\n我的打分数据\n\r\n\r\n在豆瓣250里，我一共给68部电影打5星，175部电影打4星，7部电影打3星。\n\r\n\r\n打5星的电影有：肖申克的救赎、霸王别姬、美丽人生、背靠背，脸对脸、阿甘正传、泰坦尼克号、千与千寻、盗梦空间、十二怒汉、机器人总动员、无间道、芙蓉镇、海蒂和爷爷、活着、末代皇帝、辩护人、疯狂动物…",

Since Miniconda started shipping conda-libmamba-solver in July 2023, Miniforge followed suit and started shipping it too in August. At that point, since conda-libmamba-solver depends on libmambapy, the only difference between Miniforge and Mambaforge was the presence of the mamba Python package. To minimize surprises, we decided to add mamba to Miniforge too.\nShould I choose one or another going forward at the risk of one of them gettting deprecated?\nThat said, if you had to start using one today, we recommend to stick to Miniforge.",
