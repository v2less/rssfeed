          "description": "Heya HN! We've built a Raspberry PI CM4 based SSD NAS for home hosting. We built it as a part of KubeSail.com - which is a platform aimed at making self-hosting easy and at making the technical bits (tunneling, backups, updates, etc) as easy as possible.\nYou may have seen plans for this about 9 months ago on HN, but we're finally in full production! I'll be booking tickets to fly out and help assemble the 2nd batch in a few days - we're effectively a two person computer company, which is a lot of fun and a crazy amount of work. Our mission is to make home-hosting a website, an app, or just personal photos a reasonable alternative to SaaS products.\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=32313242\nPoints: 55\n# Comments: 17",

          "description": "We're building an app that helps people manage their schedule, tasks and notes all in one place.\nThe goal is to create a workspace, where people can manage their various priorities, both personal and professional, see a single schedule combined of all their calendars and manage their days without switching between multiple apps.\nAt the moment we've implemented Google calendar synchronisation, basic tasks and notes. Also Emery has some things we really wanted to see in other apps – private notes for meetings, categories that can be used to group tasks/notes/meetings together, weekly productivity reports.\nHappy to hear any feedback and answer any questions!\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=32312413\nPoints: 125\n# Comments: 72",

My co-founder is Ilia Baranov, a career roboticist. We’re building general autonomy software for industrial vehicles.\nWe’ve just come out of stealth with a full autonomy stack freely available in sim online. Whether it’s a tractor on a farm or a 400t dump truck in a mine, we make it easy for you to make it driverless. Where before you would need an industrial vehicle, $25-150k in sensors + compute, and 6-18 months of building time, now you can start building applications that command autonomous robots right away.\nSee a demo here: https://www.loom.com/share/852d54744d45452d926b9016f61f5e43.\nTwo big things are hard about automating industrial vehicles: fi…",

          "description": "Hi HN!\nRoughly two years ago when the pandemic had people shifting to a WFH environment, I started a twice-weekly newsletter called Workspaces that gives readers a behind the scenes tour of their favorite entrepreneurs, designers, developers, etc. new desk setups.\nGrowth has remained consistent week to week, relying on the featured guests Twitter presence to help spread the word.\nI have featured 175 workspaces to date (70+ more in the backlog) and have grown the newsletter to 7,000 subscribers while maintaining a >50% open rate.\nI published the fist 117 editions of the newsletter without a sponsor. I had inbound requests but I was focused on growing the subscriber base as much as possible. With the new year, I shifted this focus slightly and began offering one sponsor slot per newsletter edition.\nSince then, the newsletter has been sold out weekly and the price has risen from the initial $150 to $250, earning $2,000 per month from sponsorships.\nI think it’s important to note that this was not an immediate cash cow… sending out 117 editions of a newsletter without receiving a dime can be draining. You have to truly enjoy the content you are putting out (I do!).\nHowever, I think this shows that consistency rules and as long as you continue to show up, put out great content and iterate based on feedback you will continue to see your newsletter grow and ultimately the money will come.\nHappy to answer any questions around newsletter growth, finding sponsors, etc!\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=32265223\nPoints: 172\n# Comments: 116",

          "description": "PickCode is designed for use on desktop and tablet, and supports creating chatbots, visual designs, and 2D games. There is plenty of functionality missing - you can't add media to games for instance, but the current version shows off the foundation of what I'm aiming at.\nI taught myself to code using MIT's App Inventor, so I have an enormous respect for block based languages like App Inventor, Scratch, Snap!, MakeCode, etc. PickCode is my attempt at adding options for students who want to learn more about programming without making the jump to text, or as an alternative to block coding for beginners coming to programming at an older age.\nThe visual language is meant to lower the barrier to entry to coding but the far more important aspect for me is giving students the ability to make things they're proud of as quickly as possible. A JS/Python API for controlling the chatbot and game engine are in the works.\nAs of now, there are sample programs to play with and an editor which saves your programs to local storage. Full user accounts, tutorials and administrator accounts for teachers to organize assignments are on their way soon. If you're interested in using PickCode in a classroom or want to discuss feedback, send me an email at charlie@pickcode.io\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=32230329\nPoints: 72\n# Comments: 23",

          "description": "Google search used to be one of the wonders of the modern digital world, but (and I admit this is subjective) it feels like the quality of results has decreased drastically over the years. I just can't find stuff as easily as I used to. It still comes out on top for e.g. querying for technical information but for other things (image search) I don't even bother with it anymore. It also feels like certain kinds of queries are subject to malicious SEO practices where it becomes impossible to find results that aren't from the same group of tabloids/media outlets.\nWhat happened? Did they let their golden goose starve to death? Or is this all in my head and Google is actually fine for everyone else?\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=32209067\nPoints: 30\n# Comments: 27",

          "description": "I'm very interested in what types of interesting data structures are out there HN. Totally your preference.\nI'll start: bloom filters. Lets you test if a value is definitely NOT in a list of pre-stored values (or POSSIBLY in a list - with adjustable probability that influences storage of the values.)\nGood use-case: routing. Say you have a list of 1 million IPs that are black listed. A trivial algorithm would be to compare every element of the set with a given IP. The time complexity grows with the number of elements. Not so with a bloom filter! A bloom filter is one of the few data structures whose time complexity does not grow with the number of elements due to the 'keys' not needing to be stored ('search' and 'insert' is based on the number of hash functions.)\nBonus section: Golomb Coded Sets are similar to bloom filters but the storage space is much smaller. Worse performance though.\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=32186203\nPoints: 142\n# Comments: 95",

We help companies measure their carbon emissions by connecting to your corporate bank account (Brex, Mercury, or any other financial institution on Plaid) and then estimating the impact of each purchase.\nThomas and I found our way to this project via our background in fintech. Prior to Bend, I was a co-founder of Abacus (YC W14), a spend management company. At Abacus, we noticed that finance teams are increasingly paying attention to the climate impact of their purchase decisions, from travel policies, to cloud hosting, and beyond.\nWe believe this 'spend based' approach is the key to unlocking scalable carbon accounting.

          "description": "A while back I wrote a CHIP-8 emulator (which is considered the Hello, World! of emulators and is more accurately a virtual machine since historically CHIP-8 was an interpreted language running on top of the COSMAC VIP to make game programming easier).\nBut a few months ago I got really interested in embedded software, so decided it would be neat to port my emulator to a STM32 MCU and design a console around it as a learning experience, since CHIP-8 never existed as a physical system.\nI didn't know much about embedded software when I began, and even less about electronics, but I managed to write all the firmware from scratch and even designed my first PCB, resulting in a finished (though not very polished) handheld CHIP-8 console.\nFor those curious, the GitHub repo also has links to my dev blog about the project as well as a build guide.\nThanks for looking!\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=32158364\nPoints: 54\n# Comments: 8",

          "description": "Hello,\nThis is a portfolio optimizer I made to help select portfolios for my clients. I'm a personal financial adviser. I generally put my clients in a mix of low-fee index funds and ETFs and I use this to set an appropriate allocation based on the client's risk tolerance.\nI have been working on this as a side project to 1) improve the theoretical underpinnings of my investment recommendations and 2) improve my coding skills with frameworks like Vue and Torch. Here's the repository for the frontend: https://github.com/justinluther502/cashgraphfront.\nThe frontend site is Vue 2 + Vuetify, and the backend is an AWS lambda function running the Torch optimizer. I am still working out kinks in the backend, particularly cold-start issues because the Lambda function has to load the entire Torch library (~2GB). This occasionally causes the AWS API Gateway to reach max timeout before the Lambda function finishes. Any tips on addressing this would be much appreciated. My first thought is maybe to pare down the Torch library used in the Lambda function because I am only using a small subset of the full library.\nThe optimizer function itself is designed to overcome several classic shortcomings in Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT) (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modern_portfolio_theory). Unlike textbook implementations of MPT, this optimizer can utilize non-normal returns distributions, risk metrics besides variance, and can allow the user to specify tail behavior, such as asset correlations behaving normally most of the time but converging to 1.0 in severe downturns. Most of these \"fixes\" happen during the generation of custom \"flavors\", or asset selection universes. I have 3 flavors pre-built and there is some information on how they are constructed in the flavor selection page.\nAny feedback greatly appreciated!\nJustin Luther justinluther@lutherwealth.com https://www.lutherwealth.com\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=32118796\nPoints: 63\n# Comments: 16",

          "description": "Hi HN.\nI built Payload to make file transfers easy for less-technical users who need large/fast transfers, so I have focused on auto-discovery, drag-and-drop, visually distinct device icons.\nIt's using Tauri (an \"Electron alternative\" built on Rust) which keeps my binaries small and bundles to .msi, .dmg, .deb and .appimage. No CLI, iOS or Android support (yet).\nThe network stack is a separate binary written in Go. It uses mDNS for local network discovery and TLS over TCP or Quic, with a public Ed25519 keypair for each device. The protocol is ad-hoc and symmetrical control stream using JSON and binary data streams. Planning to open source these parts eventually..\nTransfers should saturate the local network link. It reaches ~116 MB/s wired at my home, but if you have a >1000 Mbit link, I'd be curious to see how much speed you can squeeze out.\nSee also:\nhttps://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=21575869\nhttps://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=24351111\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=32100352\nPoints: 36\n# Comments: 13",

V8/Chrome support has been available for a long time, so another engine is required.\nTo unblock this situation we have contributed full support for WebAssembly Tail Calls to JavaScript/WebKit/Safari. The PR is available here:\nhttps://github.com/WebKit/WebKit/pull/2065\nAn in-depth article about the challenges of implementing this feature is also available. This is intended both as documentation for our contribution, but also as a general explainer about how tails calls actually work, with a particular focus on stack space management.\nhttps://leaningtech.com/fantastic-tail-calls-and-how-to-impl...\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=32069418\nPoints: 440\n# Comments: 202",

          "description": "Howdy HN, just recently made this silly typewriter variant and think some of you might enjoy it so thought I'd share.\nHere the cursor takes no heed of what you're typing and just advances at a steady pace, with the effect that typing something reasonable-looking requires you to type at a very steady rhythm. There's also the bonus that the space character is no longer needed—you can (and kind of have to) just wait—so the keyboard minimalists among us can shave even more space off their devices. Only desktop for now.\nIt's an interesting contrast to the last one I made—which requires you to do all the heavy lifting in moving the cursor position yourself—https://oisinmoran.com/typewriter\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=32049780\nPoints: 35\n# Comments: 20",

          "description": "I'm based in Vancouver, work remotely for a global company, and the outage yesterday was a huge pain in the butt for myself and many Canadians I work with... I am appalled that 911 services weren't even working in some cases.\nThe telcos here are terrible. I'd love to hear how HN users would think of bootstrapping a telco?\nWe've had a few startups try and disrupt things in Canada (e.g., Wind Mobile). They were funded by large global investment groups and eventually simply got acquired by the incumbent telcos.\nThe other approach I've seen is piggybacking on existing telco infrastructure. This is required by law since the Canadian government subsidizes telco infrastructure... It's not uncommon for the telcos to renege on their contractual/legal obligations. Plus, this doesn't create any redundant networks.\nSo: how else can one launch a telco? What creative solutions have folks seen?\nI'm thinking: VOIP-only service that has direct access to the Internet backbone in Toronto, Vancouver, etc. so you can at least have completely separate service in major cities... Or crowdfunding 5G towers (though I imagine spectrum licensing is an issue here).\nWould love to hear what other HN readers think.\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=32035633\nPoints: 114\n# Comments: 91",

Since then the language design has evolved and the compiler has gotten much more solid.\nAssorted extra info:\n- The C3 name is a homage to the C2 language project (http://c2lang.org) which it was originally inspired by.\n- Although C3 mostly conforms to C syntax, the most obvious change is requiring `fn` in front of the functions. This is to simplify searching for definitions in editors.\n- There is a comparison with some other languages here: http://www.c3-lang.org/compare/\n- The parts in C3 which breaks C semantics or syntax: http://www.c3-lang.org/changesfromc/\n- Aside from the very C-like syntax, one the biggest difference between C3 and other \"C competitors\" is that C3 prioritizes C ABI compatibility, so that all C3 special types (such as slices and optionals) can be used from C without any effort. C and C3 can coexist nicely in a code base.\n- Currently the standard library is not even alpha quality, it's actively being built, but there is a `libc` module which allows accessing all of libc. Raylib is available to use from C3 with MacOS and Windows, see: https://github.com/c3lang/vendor\n- There is a blog with assorted articles I've written during the development: https://c3.handmade.network/blog\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=32005678\nPoints: 109\n# Comments: 63",

Hello saves you time by synthesizing clear explanations to technical questions along with code snippets from the web, showing them right on the search page.\nWe’ve found that most technical searches fall into a few categories: ad-hoc how-tos, understanding an API, recalling forgotten details, research, or troubleshooting. Google is too broad and shallow of a search tool to be good at this. Even after sifting through the deluge of spammy, irrelevant sites pumped full of SEO, you still have to manually find your answer through discussion boards or documentation.

          "description": "Hi, OP here. A friend was involved in a custody battle and was afraid his ex was going to leak all of his discovery documents on the internet and he asked if there was something I could do to make it harder for bots/crawlers to find sensitive information. Originally I was going to turn all of his docs to image based PDFs, but those get large fast and are easy to OCR.\nSo I found a post musing about altering fonts/glyphs so that it looks like english, but the actual character being seen by the pdf reader is a non-english character. As such, when you try to OCR these files, it doesn't see any images and can't convert it.\nI figured it had some potential uses and maybe you fine folks can identify other use cases. I'll be monitoring this post most of the day.\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=32002555\nPoints: 121\n# Comments: 103",

          "description": "Someone was asking how to determine the quality of coding practices at places they are interviewing. My mind went on a tangent wondering if it is fair for interviewees to bring a coding exercise for the interviewers to complete. I've heard that interviews are an opportunity for both sides to interview each other? So does the interviewee have an equal opportunity to determine how the interviewers work through problems by presenting their own exercise for the interviewers to complete, and therefore gain insight on the company's practices?\nI've never heard of anyone doing this before and I don't think it would be well received. Has anyone done this? For anyone who conducts interviews what would you think if someone did this?\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=31981963\nPoints: 22\n# Comments: 31",

          "description": "Hi HN,\nI released Trane over the weekend: https://github.com/trane-project/trane. Trane is an automated\nsystem for learning complex skills. Think of it like defining a skills tree (technically a graph) of\nall the smaller skills you need to master a complex skill and having an automated system to\nautomatically traverse the graph as you master them.\nThe seed for Trane was planted after my frustration trying to learn music, and jazz in particular.\nThere are simply too many things you need to master first (e.g. knowing the names of a note, knowing\nwhere the notes are in your instrument, timing, etc) and it becomes difficult to track what it is\nthat you should focus on, and there is a process of constant atrophy, even if you practice\nconsistently.\nTrane is an early state, but is already usable. I have released a command line interface at\nhttps://github.com/trane-project/trane-cli and some music courses at\nhttps://github.com/trane-project/trane-music.\nI would like to get some ideas in regard to what other skills could be a good fit for Trane. I am\nthinking chess, programming, or languages could be a fit. I am wondering if Trane could be applied\nto something like learning pure mathematics. I would love to hear any suggestions. Perhaps there's\nsome of you who have found a similar issue while practicing your own hobbies.\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=31980069\nPoints: 35\n# Comments: 8",

          "description": "The idea behind both of these is to run commands one after another, but there is one subtle difference: ; will run the second command immediately after the first one returns, but && will only run the second one if and only if the first command returns 0 (success). Returning anything else or crashing will result in the second command not being run. Note that a line break (\\n) is the same as using ; in Bash.\n Here's an example: Let's say you are cloning a Git repository, then installing the software. So the goal is to run git clone https://www.github.com/NateNate60/myrepo, then run cd myrepo, and then make and make install. Simple enough. A naive script:\n git clone https://www.github.com/NateNate60/myrepo cd myrepo make make install \n ...or the one-liner:\n git clone https://www.github.com/NateNate60/myrepo; cd myrepo; make; make install \n Both of these will usually work, but the second command onward is only valid if the git clone succeeds! Otherwise, ./myrepo will not exist, so cd will fail, and then the Bash will end up running make and make install on the current directory.\n Note that there is a double-whammy in the naive script; make install is only valid if make works! So if compilation fails, and the makefile is either misconfigured or worse, you could end up installing junk.\n So if you're smart and you know your stuff about Bash, you would instead write:\n git clone https://www.github.com/NateNate60/myrepo && \\ cd myrepo && \\ make && make install \n ...or maybe you'd store the return value and intelligently report an error to the user :)\n    submitted by    /u/NateNate60  \n [link]   [comments]",

The first partition is \"System reserver\", and uses 579 Mb formatted with NTFS. The second one is C:, The black empty space is space that i got out of c, E: is a weird partition that got created on its own, and i have absoloutely no idea of what that is for. There are no files in there, and i cant expand it or shrink it. I just want to move that black unallocated space close to the 112 Gb ext4 partition so i can enlarge it. What should i do? I am afraid that it's some kind of boot thing, even though i use MBR, not GPT! My dream would be freeing that MBR primary partition and absoloutely anhillating it. Can i do it?\n Once again, this is straight out of that post, I don't know if posting it here is appropriate but after having cried on this crappy partition i really feel in moral debt of explaining how to fix this.\n    submitted by    /u/PsychologicalPark266  \n [link]   [comments]",

Anyone here that has done this project in the past and can recommend if this is a good way to learn how Linux works from a service level? \n I always wanted to create/have a minimal Linux based operation system without a package manager which allows you to compile binaries to use in a tty interface. I don’t even want a GUI interface (maybe support for X window system to run OpenGL applications in full screen, but thats about it, don’t need things like a window manager etc) \n Is this a doable project for 4/6 month’s time for someone who has an C/C++ embedded and networking background?

          "description": "If you genuinely want to support, Mozilla Firefox, use the stock install and allow Firefox to report data automatically.\n  \nMany distros bundle Firefox but customize it. As a result, someone often is wasting their time, trying to figure out if an issue is with Firefox or the customization the distro added. It ends up being a lot of unnecessary wasted time that could be spent trying to improve the product (Firefox).\n The more people who participate either directly or indirectly, the more knowledge Mozilla will have to improve their browser. It is why often chromium has an advantage because you cannot opt-out, and so they know how everyone uses their browser and how to make that experience better. It's nice that you can opt-out in Mozilla, but you're not doing anyone any favors when you do.\n  \nYou can easily download a fresh, copy of Mozilla Firefox, directly from their website. https://www.mozilla.org/firefox/browsers/ \n Ultimately, the more people who use a clean copy of Mozilla Firefox, and participate in the basic analytics, the better the browser can be. This is the best passive way, you can help Mozilla Firefox.\n Additionally, if you wish to take a more active role, you can also directly submit bugs and provide direct feedback. Information on this can be located here https://support.mozilla.org/kb/file-bug-report-or-feature-request-mozilla\n I made a simple installer, so even newbies could install a clean, stock experience directly from Mozilla (along with all the shortcuts). It works independently, so it has no impact on the packages you have installed. You can install any edition of Mozilla Firefox, side by side, if you wish, including your distro's bundled copy. Lastly, if you don't want it installed for everyone, or are not the system admin, I also have a personal, localized installer too (keeps everything in your home folder). https://github.com/Linux-Is-Best/Firefox-automatic-install-for-Linux\n    submitted by    /u/Linux-Is-Best  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I'm seeing a lot of marketing surrounding ChromeOS Flex and many YouTubers, who didn't even know what an OS is are making videos claiming ChromeOS Flex to be the only OS in existence that can make your old PC come back to life. Obviously, all of this is pretty frustrating to look at when you already know the better alternatives.\n One claim that often seems to come up, is ChromeOS is backed by a big corporation. A corporation you can 'trust' (whatever that means) and a corporation that has the best privacy and security measures for an OS.\n So I'd like to ask, how much worse is ChromeOS from a security and privacy standpoint, compared to other beginner distros like ZorinOS, Linux Mint or Ubuntu. As a FOSS fan, I obviously have a bias against it but I'd like to hear some opinions and objective points.\n    submitted by    /u/NayamAmarshe  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "It's interesting to notice that when Linux installs, most of them ask if you want to install alongside your other OS, and when they replace the boot loader, they replace it with something that allows you to access your previously installed OSes if still present.\n On the other hand, we have Microsoft Windows. Which doesn't seem to know what \"other OS\" is, and when it overwrites your boot loader, it overwrites it with something that can only see WIndows and will only let you boot to Windows.\n What I'm wondering is how that latter behavior hasn't been caught on to as a way to squelch competition? Yeah, maybe it's not as common as pasting icons all over people's desktops, but when someone is trying to flip between OSes, and one of those OSes is actively trying to prevent that and interfere with that, shouldn't it be a serious issue?\n    submitted by    /u/npaladin2000  \n [link]   [comments]",

The fans only occasionally kicked in lightly and when they did, I didn't even notice it as the 3500u barely went above 50C! This is such an improvement compared to windows where CPU usage spiked randomly as well as temps following suit, the fans would rapidly kick in loudly and my battery would be drained quickly.

The company develops a product based on Debian, so all developers there use Linux. The development is done on VM's with the product. As far as I know Ubuntu is the standard and my instructor uses Debian. I can do my work with both and handle them as well, but I hate snap on Ubuntu and Debian has too old packets for me. At home I've been using Arch linux for almost 3 years and I get along wonderfully and I never had any problems. And since I am a new trainee I think he wants me to use Ubuntu or Debian first. Do you have any ideas how I can convince my instructor to let me use Arch on my laptop?\n    submitted by    /u/IGambleNull  \n [link]   [comments]",

I have been using Linux for maybe 3 months; I deleted my Windows partition less than 2 months ago.\n To be honest, I have found that Linux gaming is pretty much on a similar level to Windows.\n I am by no means a tech savvy person. I am probably below average, compared to the average person. I do know the internal components of my PC, though, and I can troubleshoot software bugs or solve some problems on my own. And that's really all you need to know for Linux gaming. Well, that, and the ability to Google \"stuff\".\n Via Steam, all you need to do is to use Proton, and most games will work out of the box, no issues.

          "description": "Hello all. Let me preface this by saying I ran two main Linux machines: a Ubuntu one and a Fedora one. I tend to favor Ubuntu for Nvidia setups due to their straightforward compatibility with Secure Boot. Secure Boot under Ubuntu is just a breeze. On Fedora, though, you must do some small stuff that it's not too much of a bother but that I'd rather not do. Because of this, I always preferred Ubuntu. I had to change to Fedora, though, to the lack of maintenance on many Ubuntu packages.\n Let's take Lutris for example. The latest version of Ubuntu has in its repos currently an older version than Fedora 35, which was released in 2021!.\n The same happens with VLC or Rhythmbox (the difference is minor, but it's there), Libreoffice (you only get the latest versions if you use a 3rd party repo, and let's not even talk about Ubuntu 20.04 which still runs LO 6.4, and we are on 7.3), gcc and let's not even talk about Touchegg (this one is just ridiculous, Ubuntu still ships a release from 2011!).\n I seriously cannot understand how a community-led project such as Fedora (granted, it's with Redhat funding, but still community led) has a much more up to date repository on a release from 2021 than Ubuntu does in its latest release.\n What's left for Ubuntu? Showcases of robots and a nice theming? It's just sad.\n    submitted by    /u/jorgesgk  \n [link]   [comments]",

If there are many different files, (like 50-100k) the opperation takes maybe 10x longer on Windows than on Linux. There are many more similar things.\n Have anyone else noticed the same thing and if it's universal, why do you think that is the case?\n ​\n EDIT: \n Thanks for all the detailed answers!

My current laptop is a decade old now and while it still runs okay, it’s out of date and can only handle older stuff. So it’s time for something new. Apple has lost me these days. While I still make art and sometimes music, they are less important to me these days and being able to work on or upgrade my own computer is more important to me. And while I believe that ARM architecture is probably what most devices will eventually be running I’m not ready for a M1 laptop and the issues it brings. I realized that my Linux VMs get more use than the host OS, so I figured it’s time to switch. So looking to pick up a system76 laptop. \n However, I may not make a lot of music any more but I still consume a lot of it. As much as I dislike Apple these days, I dislike Google more so I won’t be switching to android. \n So for those of you on Linux 24/7 and have an iPhone, how do you handle loading music or movies to your device, and how do you handle getting photos off of your device for back up (or in my case digital manipulation for art)?\n    submitted by    /u/x00future  \n [link]   [comments]",

I looked installing Windows 7, but I couldn't afford it. After researching my options, I found Ubuntu, I learned how to create a liveUSB and how to install Ubuntu by watching YouTube videos and I managed to install Ubuntu on my laptop and I was pleasantly surprised, because you know the saying, \"You get what you paid for,\" that usually means if it's free it's crap, but that wasn't the case with Ubuntu though, Ubuntu can do everything Windows 7 can do and my Windows games, like Starcraft, managed to run on Wine, so I was pleasantly surprised. \n So yeah, I got into Ubuntu, not because I believed in open-source and the free software movement, no, I got into Linux because I'm a cheapskate that couldn't afford Windows 7, does that make me a bad Linux user?\n    submitted by    /u/ardouronerous  \n [link]   [comments]",

He purchased a piece of mine at an art show in Indy, where we both lived, maybe around 2003-5. I'm bad with dates. Later, he contacted me to commission a piece of art -- a rendition of a \"Linux family tree\" he had conceived of. I went to his place in downtown Indy to talk it over. He surprised me slightly by showing me the mockup on a Mac! It was kind of funny. I was familiar w Linux at the time and I had planned to do the piece, which he was going to get posters made of. He assured me we could sell 10K of them! That would have been great but my personal problems and the challenges of the project got in the way. It was most interesting to meet him though, and his death really gave me pause. I was left wondering whether his victimization at the hands of the SF police, and his stayed commitment to make it known, had something to do with it. Suicide was the given cause of his passing, but was that really the case? Perhaps it was, and in any case I mean no disrespect. Having met him was really cool, and I'll always wish I had tried harder to make good on the commission. He was an intense dude. RIP Ian.

Explores the nature of the operating system market and Windows/Mac/Linux from a standpoint that doesn't require a technical background. One thing I'm curious about... Stephenson makes it very clear that he is on the Linux side of the discussion, and perhaps he is biased, but he makes Linux systems to be unstoppable and Windows NT very buggy. However I recall the consensus on a different post asking 'what does windows offer that linux can't' to be stability. I'm not technically experienced and fairly young but I've been messing around with linux since I was a kid. (First time installing a linux distro would have been somewhere around 2005 to 2010). Where along the way did Windows surpass Linux in terms of stability? Or are these perhaps differing definitions or contexts of what exactly is meant by 'stable'?\n    submitted by    /u/Monolithx64  \n [link]   [comments]",

I just saw a Linux solution that I think is very unique and I wanted t share it.\n My school is full of macs but some of us still wants to use Linux (for development using Valgrind) and he made an Alpine docker image and a bash script that launches that, when docker is running, starts the Linux machine and automatically connects to it. The ingenious thin that I didn't think about is that it mounts the Mac home partition for itself, so it can fully interact with the files flawlessly. \n I find this hole think really cool, and I'll probably use it for development as well.\n Have you guys used /heard about this kind of setup, do you have any tips to make even better use of it?\n    submitted by    /u/Lacusch  \n [link]   [comments]",

I'm doing it mostly for redundancy and personal ease of use, of course, but I still want to make sure that other people are free to copy my files and/or take inspiration from them as they create their own. That means I need a license of some sort.\n However, choosing a license for a dotfiles repository doesn't seem quite as cut-and-dry as choosing a license for a program of my own design. These files aren't exactly my personal creation; I mean, they were written by me, but they're essentially just a set of options being passed to their respective programs. It doesn't quite feel fair to the developers of Alacritty, for instance, for me to say \"Alacritty I want you to use this hex for the color blue\" and then turn around and distribute that as if it were my own work.\n During my research I've found examples of a few different kinds of licenses in random people's repositories, but so far I've been unable to find any articles, guides, or even discussions on the subject.

But on Windows, the same KeePassXC shows the dialog instantly - so there's no chance I can accidentally press a key too soon.\n This raised a question in my mind: is X11 slower than Windows? Is there some secret way to speed it up, or is the architecture just fundamentally slow?\n I run Xorg with Fluxbox as the window manager and Picom as the compositor. Would any of these be the reason for my observed slowness? Maybe the fact that I only have graphics acceleration on my iGPU, and not my Nvidia GPU?\n (Bonus: is Wayland faster than X11? I don't want to use it, because my entire reason for using X11 at the moment is because I want to make a compositor, not an entire desktop environment, but I'm curious anyway.)\n Note that this isn't a support request - I'd rather discuss if there's something up with X11's architecture that would make it fundamentally incapable of surpassing Windows' performance.

Better check for updates! Wouldn't want to be out of date!\" And even I can say I'm being excessive. I use Debian/Debian based distros, so those aren't as bleeding edge as others. How often do you need to update to stay safe? Would I be able to go a week? A month? A year, without updating?

          "description": "Hello all! Despite my several year usage of Linux and passion for programming, I've not yet delved into the depths of several aspects of Linux itself. I'm working on that now.\n As I come across environment variables, it strikes me that there's so much potential! And it strikes me as interesting that they're not typed whatsoever (useful for quick/dirty scripts, for sure). \n I've not had much success in searching (although I found GNU's Guile, which looks interesting; maybe not entirely related) but I'm interested to know:\n What is the state of the art in using environment variables for more sophisticated scripts/programming? It seems, for example, that we could create an entire DSL (Domain Specific Language) within such variables that could be changed at runtime -- it seems that having these variables typed would be of interest, it seems that error-checking would be desirable (e.g., if we set an environment variable in a way that depends on an external network call, we want to know if it failed or not) -- again, it seems that there'd be so much potential! \n I'm certain I'm not the first to think of this, so I'm wondering what experience in these matters exist.

It's pretty amazing but\n why is this not built in?\n I just recently clean installed Ubuntu 22.04, and I noticed they added some power management to the settings. I think to myself \"it's about gosh darn time\" then just today I'm sitting there not even watching videos I'm just browsing the web and after an hour, half of my battery is gone.\n I do a little research and it turns out the power management they included is rubbish. All it really does is CPU throttling. I remove it and install TLP and the battery reports going from 8 watts at idle down to 6 Watts.\n The battery life on Ubuntu out of the box on a laptop is so bad it's going to turn people away why would they not include TLP by default when being installed bare metal on a laptop?\n (I haven't really tried any other distributions on battery so I can't speak to anything other than Ubuntu but I read Fedora has a similar issue)\n    submitted by    /u/jmpz11  \n [link]   [comments]",

Before he died, he recommended I try CentOS since its “more or less free Redhat”. I never thought about it too much, but I’ve been thinking about him and wanted to give Cent a shot.

          "description": "Little context: I was recently looking into a post saying that CutefishOS is basically dead (And by this point there isn't any doubt of that). Their email is not responding, their website no longer can be found, and any GitHub commits are basically pretty simple things. Apparently the reason is not enough funding.\n Under that post, I saw someone saying about reviving it again, and replied saying that if there are a few of us looking to do so I was ready to help. Long story short, about 10 people wanted to help me, so I've decided to overtake their distribution and recreate it from scratch using their desktop, apps etc.\n And this is where the first questions start:\n  \n1. What would you like to see from a distro like CutefishOS? Any recommendations, improvements? Don't be afraid to ask for some major changes.\n 2. CutefishOS was using both Ubuntu and Debian as it's own base. I've also thought of Arch but I'm worried about stability and user friendliness, but it's not gone yet as an idea. Which one do you think would suit you better out of these three?\n 3. Any particular things you don't like about CutefishOS? (Literally anything).\n 4. Since this isn't really CutefishOS but rather a fork of it, I'd like to hear some name suggestions. Preferably not mentioning any other distro than CutefishOS.\n  \nI might create a GitHub repo to discuss everything there as devs, as soon as I'm sure there are people interested in the project.\n    submitted by    /u/AndroGR  \n [link]   [comments]",

This is good, as the screen is also bigger. Though not *big*, but bigger than a Switch. \n I got the mid-range Steam Deck with 256G storage. I'm not much of a gamer but played a few games including Dying Light, Road96 and a couple others. They played fine and I didn't notice any weirdness or incompatibilities. It is easy enough to use that were I to buy any other games, it would be my first choice versus one of the laptops. Performance is better than my Android tablets.\n The Desktop mode was interesting. It looks just like a desktop and when attached to a monitor and keyboard, is perfectly serviceable as a minimal desktop. At work, a good 80% of my time is in a tmux terminal, 10% in a browser, and 10% in VSCode. The trackpad was serviceable as a mouse, but definitely worth connecting a proper mouse (bluetooth is supported). No issues with my keyboards (both US and German).

          "description": "I made \"I Spy Notify\", which lets you watch Linux desktop notifications and run scripts for each notification. It's great for (but not limited to!) logging, displaying popups, and playing sounds.\n You can visit the GitHub repository here: https://github.com/haritkapadia/i-spy-notify.\n The project comes with an XDG Desktop file and a System-D service file. The configuration file is ~/.config/i-spy-notify.json. Example configurations are in the doc/examples folder. The project is written in C.\n Here's some fun things I learned about Linux notifications while working on I Spy Notify.\n  \nThere are many ways to send image data over a notification. You can: \n Send a key word that is associated with an icon (for example, \"camera-photo\" represents an image of a camera in your current icon theme).\n Send a path to the image.\n Send the image as a byte stream (the format is basically an array of pixels, and is very similar to the GdkPixbuf struct).\n \n Notifications can be replaced by other notifications, if the application requests it.\n When an application sends a notification, it may first query the notification daemon for the server's capabilities, which explain what features of the standard that the daemon supports.\n dbus-monitor monitors a bus by sending a message to the bus that requests that the connection established by dbus-monitor becomes a monitor connection. If there is already a notification daemon running (which there usually is), I create a monitor connection in the same way.\n  \n   submitted by    /u/narilth  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "This seems to be a very small distro and the dev apparently doesn't have any interest in a Reddit presence...hasn't even made it to DistroWatch yet. I'm not here to plug the thing technically, it's easy to Google, but I'm wondering if anyone's tried it yet, before I start messing with it in a VM? Any experience or thoughts on it?\n EDIT: ok, I've installed it, and here are my thoughts. It's pretty much a basic Arch install, with a moderately heavy Plasma desktop that incorporates a top menu and Latte. Not as heavy as Garuda, but more than Endeavour. The OS doesn't install everything and the kitchen sink like Garuda, but it does give you this set of startup dialogs that ask you if you want to install this stuff. Probably a better implementation than the way RebornOS or ArcosLinux does it (a huge list of checkboxes), and at least it's easy enough to close and get rid of. Not a fan of the heavy theming but they do claim to be all about the eye candy, so I'm not surprised it's there. I suppose it'll serve a purpose if it gathers enough community, but for now, I'll pass. It's filling a niche that I'm not so sure exists yet. Wouldn't mind seeing that after-install tool ported to other Arch variants though. \n    submitted by    /u/npaladin2000  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I had vanilla Ubuntu for ages. It worked fine. Then I started coming across videos by Distro Tube, ThePrimeagen, Brodie Robertson, Linux experiment and more, and the ecosystem opens up to me.\n I tried AwesomeWM, am currently driving LeftWM, I switched from Bash in Gnome Terminal to Fish in Alacritty, I installed Thunar, and a few more programs. I think much of these changes suit me better than vanilla Ubuntu.\n However, it has left me somewhat worried as well. I discovered these programs through YouTube. Deeper than that, I discovered that there were issues at all with my original setup. I see that things are better now, but I never stopped to notice it was bad in the first place.\n So I never thought to look for tiling window managers, never imagined that it was a thing, because I was desensitized to the floating Gnome window manager. I was doing mostly fine with Bash in GTerm, and didn't think much of it. I didn't realize that these programs had problems that could be solved before I saw videos praising the solutions.\n Is there a good way to discover this kind of minor everyday friction and check if ready-made solutions exist? Or is it mostly about having lots of feelers out and wait for word of mouth of some new software to reach you before you start to ask whether it actually solves a problem for you?\n    submitted by    /u/MasterHigure  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hey guys, \n During my journey in the Linux sphere I stumbled upon a lot of content, especially Youtube videos that promote the use of Firefox to counter the rise of Chromium based browsers. \n I completely understand that using another browser than Google Chrome is important to avoid a browser monopoly but I don't really understand the war that many Linux/FOSS enthusiasts leads against Chromium based browsers.\n I don't see Blink (Chromium) as a competitor to Gecko (Firefox) but more as a successor. Gecko is old (even if heavily maintained) and is slower than Blink in many ways (it is perceptible to the end user and benchmarks proves it). \n Blink is like Gecko an open source project and even if Google is at the lead of the project they can't really do anything that goes against the interests of the users or developers without suffering from a huge backlash. And even if they try to put their interests first there will always be communities to fork the project and remove Google's shit (ungoogled-chromium is an already existing example). And I am nearly sure that there will be in the future someone or a company to fork Blink and create a new engine, putting Blink at the same place where Gecko is currently. \n For me the main reason to stop using Gecko based browsers is for compatibility, if all browsers end up sharing the same foundations, thanks to Blink, creating a website would be a much easier process and it might save time (and mental sanity) to a lot of developers all around the world while not compromising on privacy for the end user. \n I am completely conscious that I might be wrong as a lot of more grown people from the community don't share my opinion but usually the explanations are limited to \"do this to avoid a monopoly\" so I wanted at least some reasons for this \"war\" against Blink/Chromium.\n    submitted by    /u/Poissonard  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "To start with, until a few days ago I was using an RTX 3090 on linux. I could have used wayland but it was not an ideal experience, and I assumed that was because of being on propriety drivers.\n So I went out and bought a fresh 6900xt and installed that, thinking \"great, off we go to wayland\".\n Here is what I have struggled with for the last 48 or so hours with a fresh endeavour OS install.\n  \nvscode doesn't run in wayland at all, or sometimes it does but the window is graphically frozen unless I move it to another display/change window size. It will then update one frame and stop again.\n This used to be an old github issue which was fixed and closed a few months ago, but it's back again.\n Most 'wayland' terminals I have installed are blurring on fractional scaling. How/why if they are wayland apps? e.g. kitty looks like poop on fractional scale.\n All xwayland apps scale horribly with fractional scaling/look blurry. I don't know if this is an elitist thing (\"lol just install wayland apps noob\") but most popular linux apps are on electron, and thus, xwayland. \n Trying to force certain electron apps (that support the flag) to run in wayland sometimes crashes my desktop and logs me out (sway and hyprland)\n Why do I need to keep telling apps to use wayland when I am in wayland, at all? why isn't this automatic? \n Screen recording.\n Gaming. Please no \"lol this is linux no gaming\". See steam deck.\n  \nIt feels like wayland is just a more bare metal version of mutter for gnome that tells everyone \"don't worry, you can all use wayland\" but, not really.\n I had a look around for any help for geting xwayland apps to scale better but... nothing. I would even settle for mac OS style scaling (scale up double then multple of resolution down).\n Anyway, let me know if I am missing any magic tricks to make the above work.\n    submitted by    /u/Ashtefere  \n [link]   [comments]",

A few people have pointed out that it'd be nice to have on Linux on the Nvidia Forum, and there has been a response from someone at Nvidia a month ago pointing to the API docs for Maxine. It looks like the Maxine Audio SDK can do the same thing as RTX Voice, and it has Linux support according to the docs, and it looks like implementing it isn't that hard. So if I'm not the only one who misses RTX Voice on Linux and you have the time for it, you could make a Pipewire plugin or something that uses that SDK to port RTX Voice on Linux. I might take a go at it in 1-2 months if no one does, but I just don't have time for it right now. Just thought I'd share this here :)\n    submitted by    /u/alexhmc  \n [link]   [comments]",

It's not really a big deal since I can just use startx instead, but it's just one extra thing to fix when setting up a new install.\n The worst instance of this came yesterday - I had just put a fresh install of Debian 11 on my PC, and told the installer to put KDE on the system as well. I boot up the machine and it hung on \"Initializing CUPS\". Turns out sddm was the culprit, again. Once I disabled it, I booted straight into a login prompt from which I could startx, and everything worked.\n I had to have a bit of a laugh at something being broken on a fresh install of Debian, of all distros.

          "description": "So I am currently researching VR Headsets and one criteria I search by is how well (and if at all) their native SDKs work under Linux.\n Im new to VR and Linux so I dont have a full understanding yet.\n ​\n From my understanding developing an VR app (not games exclusively) requires the SDK of the Headset manufacturer or OpenVR from Valve that apparently supports most Headsets.\n For gaming you would need Unity or Unreal Engine with the SDK Plug provided by the Headset Manufacturer.\n (In case of HP, they apparently dont offer an SDK since MS Mixed Reality doenst have an SDK and you need Vidual Studio)\n ​\n Eg:\n If I want to programm \n - a simple VR app for the HTC Vive Pro 2 I would need the Viveport SDK.\n - a game in Unity I would need Unity engine plus the Viveport SDK plug in for Unity\n ​\n Now my questions are:\n ​\n How supported and commonly used is Linux when developing VR apps?\n And how well do these SDKs provided by manufacturers work under Linux? (eg Viveport doesnt even list Linux in their system specs)\n    submitted by    /u/Azaiiii  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Debian 会考虑在官方版本中添加非自由固件吗？如果他们想解决 Debian 开发人员重点提出的问题，这似乎是一种可能性。\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n由于 Debian 的稳定性和新功能之间的平衡，它是最受欢迎的 Linux 发行版之一。\n\r\n此外，它不附带任何非自由固件。\n\r\n但是，对于想要在较新硬件上使用 Debian 的用户来说，这已成为一个问题。\n\r\n大多数最新的设备和配置都需要非自由固件才能正常工作，其中包括 Wi-Fi、图形等。\n\r\n为了解决这个问题，Debian 开发人员、前 Debian 项目负责人 Steve McIntyre 已经积极讨论了一段时间。\n\r\n正如 Geeker's Digest 所发现的，在 DebConf 22 会议上，Steve 最近向用户和开发人员着重谈到了修复固件混乱这件事。\n\r\n在官方版本中包含非免费固件\n\r\n至于目前的情况，你可以找到带有非自由固件的非官方 Debian 镜像。\n\r\n然而，并不是每个用户都知道它，即使它在 Debian 的下载页面上被宣传，“非官方”也不是用户更喜欢推荐的镜像的东西。\n\r\n此外，当用户可以选择 Ubuntu 或任何基于 Ubuntu 的发行版作为替代方案时，期望用户安装非自由固件也是违反直觉的。\n\r\n不仅限于这些问题，Steve 在他的 博客 中还提到了其他一些问题，包括：\n\r\n\r\n维护单独的非自由镜像非常耗时。\n\r\n由于缺乏非自由固件，许多用户不喜欢官方镜像。\n\r\n\r\n如果我们希望更多用户在通用硬件上使用 Debian，Steve 建议尽早解决这个问题。\n\r\n可能会通过安装程序中的提示让用户安装非自由固件，类似于 Ubuntu 所做的。\n\r\n此外，在他在 DebConf 22 的演讲中，似乎大多数开发人员投票支持在官方 Debian 镜像中添加非自由固件。\n\r\n随着他重点提出这件事，Steve 得到了寻找解决这个问题的社区用户/开发人员的更多关注。\n\r\n简单/方便的出路：在官方发布的镜像中添加非自由固件。\n\r\n那么，Debian 最终会在其新版本中添加对非自由固件的支持吗？ Debian 12 会让这成为现实吗？\n\r\n在下面的评论中分享你的想法。\n\r\n\r\nvia: https://news.itsfoss.com/debian-non-free/\n\r\n作者：Ankush Das 选题：lkxed 译者：wxy 校对：wxy\n\r\n本文由 LCTT 原创编译，Linux中国 荣誉推出",

          "description": "我对终端Terminal是怎么回事困惑了很久。\n\r\n但在上个星期，我使用 xterm.js 在浏览器中显示了一个交互式终端，我终于想到要问一个相当基本的问题：当你在终端中按下键盘上的一个键（比如 Delete，或 Escape，或 a），发送了哪些字节？\n\r\n像往常一样，我们将通过做一些实验来回答这个问题，看看会发生什么 : )\n\r\n远程终端是非常古老的技术\n\r\n首先，我想说的是，用 xterm.js 在浏览器中显示一个终端可能看起来像一个新事物，但它真的不是。在 70 年代，计算机很昂贵。因此，一个机构的许多员工会共用一台电脑，每个人都可以有自己的 “终端” 来连接该电脑。\n\r\n例如，这里有一张 70 年代或 80 年代的 VT100 终端的照片。这看起来像是一台计算机（它有点大！），但它不是 —— 它只是显示实际计算机发送的任何信息。\n\r\nEC_VT100_terminal.jpg\">\n\r\n当然，在 70 年代，他们并没有使用 Websocket 来做这个，但来回发送的信息的方式和当时差不多。\n\r\n（照片中的终端是来自西雅图的 活电脑博物馆Living Computer Museum，我曾经去过那里，并在一个非常老的 Unix 系统上用 ed 编写了 FizzBuzz，所以我有可能真的用过那台机器或它的一个兄弟姐妹！我真的希望活电脑博物馆能再次开放，能玩到老式电脑是非常酷的。）\n\r\n发送了什么信息？\n\r\n很明显，如果你想连接到一个远程计算机（用 ssh 或使用 xterm.js 和 Websocket，或其他任何方式），那么需要在客户端和服务器之间发送一些信息。\n\r\n具体来说：\n\r\n客户端 需要发送用户输入的键盘信息（如 ls -l）。 服务器 需要告诉客户端在屏幕上显示什么。\n\r\n让我们看看一个真正的程序，它在浏览器中运行一个远程终端，看看有哪些信息会被来回发送！\n\r…",

          "description": "微软商店新规禁止上架苹果的浏览器\n\r\n在大家都关注微软商店针对开源软件售卖的 新规定 的时候，这批新条款中还有专门针对苹果的 WebKit 浏览器内核的限制：如果要想在微软商店提交浏览器产品的话，只能使用 Chromium 内核和 Gecko 内核，其他内核例如 WebKit 等都是不被允许的。微软给出的解释是平台兼容性和安全性考虑。WebKit 主要是苹果的 Safari 浏览器所使用的引擎，而 Chromium 是微软 Edge 和谷歌 Chrome 所使用的内核，Gecko 是 Firefox 使用的内核。这和苹果在在 iOS 和 iPadOS 上的政策如出一辙，苹果也禁止第三方浏览器内核，所有苹果商店上架的浏览器都必须使用 WebKit，所以 iPhone 上的 Chrome 只是个套皮版本，内核并非 Chromium。\n\r\n\r\n消息来源：The Register\n\r\n\r\n\r\n老王点评：你做得了初一，就别怪我做十五。我想微软是等着看欧盟对苹果 iOS 上的 WebKit 独占的裁决结果吧。\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n谷歌应用商店将恢复应用权限列表\n\r\n正如我们之前 报道 的，谷歌应用商店新增加了由开发者提供的“数据安全”部分，并删除了旧的“应用程序权限列表”。我当时认为此举不妥，应该保留这个权限列表，它是根据应用安装时申请的权限自动扫描生成的。现在，看起来谷歌收到了大家的反馈，安卓的开发人员在推特上表示，“你认为谷歌商店中的应用权限部分很有用，我们决定恢复它。”权限列表代表一个应用程序访问特定数据的能力，而数据安全的重点是一个应用程序收集和与第三方分享的内容。谷歌警告那些没有完全填写数据安全表格的应用尽快更新，否则将无法更新应用，甚至会被删除。\n\r\n\r\n消息来源：9to5google\n\r\n\r\n\r\n老王点评：这么简单的事情，都需要社区提醒。不过能够从善如流还是不错的。\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\nSUSE 也发布了基于网页的 Linux 发行版安装程序\n\r\n之前我们 报道 过，红帽正在开发基于网页的 Anaconda 安装程序。而 SUSE 的工程师们也在做类似的工作。这个名为 D-Installer 的安装程序建立在 YaST 之上，最近发布了 0.4 版。D-Installer 是今年年初宣布的，并于 3 月份发布了一个实验性版本。这个安装程序有一个多进程架构，可以支持安装多个产品，因此用户可以在安装时选择 openSUSE Tumbleweed / Leap Micro / Leap 等不同形态，并简化工作流程。\n\r\n\r\n消息来源：Phoronix\n\r\n\r\n\r\n老王点评：明明是 SUSE 先搞的，怎么就被红帽抢了戏了呢。:smile:",

          "description": "谷歌发布开源开发语言 Carbon，准备替代 C++\n\r\n在近日举行的 CppNorth 开发者大会上，谷歌工程师宣布了名为“Carbon” 的全新开源编程语言，并称它将是 C++ 的渐进式的继任者。Carbon 的目标是实现与 C++ 相当的性能、与 C++ 无缝的双向互操作性、为 C++ 开发者提供更容易的学习曲线、可比较的表达性，和可扩展的迁移。Carbon 团队称，“虽然 C++ 现在依旧是主导性的编程语言，并有着庞大的代码库，但由于数十年的技术积累，想要持续改进 C++ 已经是极其困难的一件事。而 Carbon 则不同，它在继承了 C++ 现有特性与生态的基础上，足够年轻，也足够‘现代化’，拥有更为广阔的优化空间，潜力更大。”\n\r\n\r\n消息来源：Phoronix\n\r\n\r\n\r\n老王点评：这一点我同意 Carbon 团队的看法，C++ 的历史包袱太重了，也越来越复杂了。但是是否 Carbon 能走在正确的道路上，我们还只能拭目以待，毕竟编程语言这种事情，不是一朝一夕就能成功的。\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n谷歌开始公开测试其 AR 眼镜\n\r\n谷歌眼镜十年后，谷歌又开始在公共场合测试智能眼镜。谷歌要求 AR 眼镜原型测试人员不得在学校、政府大楼、医疗保健场所、学校和游乐场等地方，或在开车和运动时测试该 AR 眼镜。谷歌强调，该眼镜不会拍照或录像，而是将图像数据用于辅助 AI。谷歌承诺“除非图像数据将用于分析和调试，否则将会被删除。而且会首先清除敏感内容，如面部和车牌，然后将其存储在安全的服务器，限制少数谷歌人员访问分析和调试。”\n\r\n\r\n消息来源：CNET\n\r\n\r\n\r\n老王点评：虽然十年前谷歌眼镜失败了，但是智能眼镜必然是个趋势，只是这里有很多伦理、技术的问题需要解决。目前看起来，AR 眼镜似乎是比较靠近成功的方向。\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n亚马逊自研云计算处理器可节省多达 40% 成本\n\r\nGraviton 处理器由 AWS 自主开发，于 2018 年推出，致力于为互联网上的应用程序提供动力，或帮助客户训练机器学习模型。今年 5 月，亚马逊又推出了更具成本效益的第三代 Graviton 处理器。AWS 的几家客户向媒体表示，与基于英特尔和 AMD 处理器的服务器相比，使用 Graviton 处理器的云服务器的能耗更低，运算速度更快。这些客户称，通过租用 Graviton 服务器，他们节省了 10% 到 40% 的计算成本。Twitter、Snap、Adobe 和 SAP 等公司均已成为 Graviton 服务器的客户。\n\r\n\r\n消息来源：The Information\n\r\n\r\n\r\n老王点评：虽然这条消息像是软文，不过昨天我们刚刚听说了字节跳动自研芯片，而之前阿里云也发布消息自研云服务芯片，看来云服务商和主流应用公司自研芯片，已经成为一种趋势，甚至是必要性。",

          "description": "FreeDOS 提供了一个叫做 FreeDOS Edit 的用户友好的文本编辑器。\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n在任何操作系统中，编辑文件都是一项常有的任务。当你想去做一个某事的笔记、写封信给朋友或升级一个系统配置 —— 你需要一个文本编辑器。FreeDOS 提供了一个用户友好的文本编辑器（也许没啥想象力）叫做 “FreeDOS Edit”。\n\r\n编辑文件\n\r\n最简单的启用 FreeDOS Edit 的方式就就是输入 EDIT。它提供一个空的编辑器窗口。图案背景显示为一个空的“桌面”——提醒你没有编辑任何文件。\n\r\n\n\r\n就像多数 DOS 应用程序一样，你可以按下你键盘上的 Alt 键来访问 Edit 的菜单。这就激活了这个菜单。在你按下 Alt 后，Edit 将切换到“菜单”访问方式，并高亮 “文件File” 菜单。如果你想要访问菜单栏上的一个不同的菜单，可以使用左右方向键。按向下的方向键并按下回车键来“进入”菜单。\n\r\n\n\r\n你注意到所有菜单标题的第一个字母是不同的颜色么？这种高亮字母显示了一种快捷方式。例如，“文件File”菜单的“F”高亮为红色。所以你可以按下 Alt+F（Alt 和 F 同时按下），Edit 会显示“文件File”菜单。\n\r\n\n\r\n你可以使用“文件File”菜单来开始一个新的（空）文件，或打开一个存在的文件。让我们开始一个新文件，使用方向键移动到“新建New“然后按下回车键。你也可以用 Ctrl+N （Ctrl 和 N 同时按下）打开一个新文件。\n\r\n\n\r\n此后，编辑文件应该非常简单。大多数熟悉的快捷键都可以在 FreeDOS Edit 中使用：Ctrl+C 复制文本，Ctrl+X 剪贴文本，和 Ctrl+V 将复制的或剪贴的文本粘贴到新的地方。如果你需要在一个长文档中寻找一个特殊文本，按下 Ctrl+F。保存你的工作成果，请使用 Ctrl+S 以将变更提交到硬盘。\n\r\n在 Edit 中编程\n\r\n如果你是个程序员，你也许会发现扩展的 ASCII 表是一个有用的工具。DOS 系统支持“拓展的” ASCII字符集，通常被称之为“代码页 437”。0 到 127 的标准字符包括字母 A 到 Z（大写和小写）、数字和特殊字符，如标点符号。但是，从 128 到 255 的 DOS 拓展字符包括其它语言字符和“画线”元素。DOS 程序员有时需要使用这些拓展 ASCII 字符，所以 FreeDOS Edit 可以很容易地查看所有 ASCII 码和它们的相关字符的表格。\n\r\n要查看这个 ASCII 表，请使用“工具Utilities”菜单，选择“ASCII 表ASCII Table”菜单项，这将显示一个包含该表格的窗口。\n\r\n\n\r\n沿着左边，这张表显示十六进制值“00”到“F0”，顶部展示了单一值“0”到“F”。这些为每个字符的十六进制代码提供了一个快速参考。例如，第一行（00）和第一列（0）中的项目具有十六进制值 00 + 0，即0x00（“NULL”值）。而第五行（40）和第二列（1）中的字符，其数值为 40 + 1，即 0x41（字母 “A”）。\n\r\n\n\r\n当你在表格内移动光标高亮不同的字符时，你会看到表格底部的值发生变化，展示了字符的十进制、十六进制和八进制编码。例如，移动光标以高亮在 C0 行和第 5 列的“行交叉”字符，显示这个扩展字符的代码为 197（十进制）、0xc5（十六进制）和 305（八进制）。在一个程序中，你可以通过输入十六进制值 0xc5 或八进制“转义代码” \\305 来引用这个扩展字符。\n\r\n\n\r\n请随意浏览 Edit 中的菜单，以发现其他不错的功能。例如，“选项Options”菜单允许你更改 Edit 的行为和外观。如果你喜欢使用更密集的显示，可以使用“显示Display”菜单（在“选项Options”下）将 Edit 设置为 25、43 或 50 行。你还可以强制 Edit 以单色（黑底白字）或反转模式（白底黑字）显示。\n\r\n（文内图片来自 Jim Hall，CC-BY SA 4.0）\n\r\n\r\nvia: https://opensource.com/article/21/6/freedos-text-editor\n\r\n作者：Jim Hall 选题：lujun9972 译者：yjacks 校对：wxy\n\r\n本文由 LCTT 原创编译，Linux中国 荣誉推出",

          "description": "了解一下自由软件基金会（FSF）。\n\r\n\r\n早在 1985 年，自由软件基金会（FSF）就开始提倡源代码共享的理念，并从此打响了为计算机用户和开发者捍卫权利的斗争。FSF 认为，用“开放Open”和“封闭Closed”这两个词来划分软件，十分具有局限性；于是，在为程序分类时，转而使用了以下词语：尊重自由（这个“自由free”或这个“自由Libre”）或践踏自由（“非自由non-free”或“专有proprietary”）。不管用语如何，关键之处在于，计算机必须受用户控制，而不是任由开发了计算机软件的公司来摆布。正因如此，GNU 工程、Linux 内核、Freedesktop.org 等众多自由软件项目，才会如此重要。\n\r\n最近，FSF 新上任了一位执行董事，她叫 Zoë Kooyman。我初见 Zoë 时，是在 2019 年的一个 All Things Open 大会上。当然，那个时候她还不是 FSF 的执行董事，不过已经在管理 FSF 不断增长的重大活动了 —— 包括 LibrePlant。她之前递给我了一份自由软件作者的名单，名单长得一眼望不尽，而且那些软件都是我每天在用的。由此，我也很受她那充沛的精力和诚恳的态度所打动。我只是偶然参加了一次 FSF 的聚会，但最后却和那些人成了朋友。是他们让我的数字生活有了意义，是他们保障了我能够拥有 Zoë 和 FSF 所说的 四项基本自由：\n\r\n\r\n无论用户出于何种目的，用户必须可以按照自己的意愿，自由地运行该软件（自由之零）。\n\r\n用户可以自由地学习并修改该软件，使它按照你的意愿进行计算（自由之一）。作为前提，用户必须可以得到该软件的源代码。\n\r\n用户可以自由地分发该软件的副本，这样就可以帮助别人（自由之二）。\n\r\n用户可以自由地分发该软件修改后的副本（自由之三）。借此，用户可以把改进后的软件分享给整个社区，令他人也从中受益。作…",

          "description": "这是一个可能的情景。你的系统收到了内核更新，但不知何故，事情不像以前那样顺利。\n\r\n你意识到，如果你启动到较旧的内核（是的，你可以降级内核），一切都会恢复正常。\n\r\n高兴之余你会觉得有点儿不爽。因为你不得不在每次启动时手动选择较旧的内核。\n\r\n一位年长的读者遇到了这个问题。Linux Mint 中的新内核更新没有按预期工作。启动到较旧的内核“修复”了问题，但麻烦的是在每次启动时要去手动选择较旧的内核。\n\r\n删除新内核而使用旧内核不是一个好主意，因为新内核将会在下一次系统更新时被安装使用。\n\r\n因此，我建议设置成默认启动到较旧的 Linux 内核。怎么做？这就是我将在本教程中向你展示的内容。\n\r\n启动至较旧的 Linux 内核\n\r\n你可能不了解，你的 Linux 发行版会在你的系统上安装多个 Linux 内核。不信？使用以下命令 列出 Ubuntu 中已安装的内核：\n\r\napt list --installed | grep linux-image\r\n\n\r\n当你升级系统时会获得一个新版本的内核，这时你的系统会自动选择启动至最新的可用内核。\n\r\n在 grub 屏幕中，你可以转到高级选项Advanced option（较旧的 Linux 版本）：\n\r\n\n\r\n在这里，你可以看到要启动的可用内核。选择较旧的（不带恢复选项recovery option 的条目）：\n\r\n\n\r\n你不会注意到任何显示的差异。你的文件和应用程序保持不变。\n\r\n现在你已经启动到旧内核，是时候让你的系统自动启动到它了。\n\r\n使旧内核成为默认启动项\n\r\n如果你乐于使用 Linux 终端和命令，你可以修改 /etc/default/grub 文件并在其中添加以下行：\n\r\nGRUB_DEFAULT=saved\r\nGRUB_SAVEDEFAULT=true\r\n\n\r\n然后使用如下命令 更新 GRUB：\n\r\nsudo update-grub\r\n\n\r\n你在这里所做的是告诉你的系统将当前使用的启动项保存为将来运行 GRUB 的默认启动项。\n\r\n然而，并不是每个人都善于使用命令行，因此我将专注于一个名为 Grub Customizer 的 GUI 工具。\n\r\n安装 Grub Customizer\n\r\n使用官方 PPA 在基于 Ubuntu 的发行版中安装 Grub Customizer：\n\r\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:danielrichter2007/grub-customizer\r\nsudo apt update\r\nsudo apt install grub-customizer\r\n\n\r\n对于其他发行版，请使用你的包管理器来安装此工具。\n\r\n使用 Grub Customizer 更改默认启动项\n\r\n当你运行 Grub Customizer 时，它会显示可用的启动项。\n\r\n\n\r\n在这里你有两个选择。\n\r\n选择一： 选择所需的内核项并使用箭头按钮（显示在顶部菜单上）将其向上移动。\n\r\n\n\r\n选择二： 将先前的启动项previously booted entry设为默认启动项default entry。\n\r\n\n\r\n我建议使用第二个选择，因为即使有新的内核更新它也可以工作。\n\r\n这样你就可以在 Ubuntu 或其他发行版中降级内核，甚至无需删除新内核版本。\n\r\n请注意，像 Ubuntu 这样的发行版大部分一次只保留两个内核版本。因此，最终你首选的旧内核将在新的内核版本释出时被删除。\n\r\n这个巧妙的技巧曾助我脱困。当时我 在 Ubuntu 中安装最新的 Linux 内核 ，由于某种原因它与我的音频系统有些兼容问题。\n\r\n无论是什么原因，你现在都知道如何自动启动到旧内核。\n\r\n如果有问题或建议，请在评论区留言。\n\r\n\r\nvia: https://itsfoss.com/boot-older-kernel-default/\n\r\n作者：Abhishek Prakash 选题：lkxed 译者：hanszhao80 校对：wxy\n\r\n本文由 LCTT 原创编译，Linux中国 荣誉推出",

          "description": "有一个想要为你带来一款诺基亚风格的 Linux 手机的开源项目，但诺基亚似乎并不喜欢这个项目的名字。\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n近期，一个旨在打造经典诺基亚（小型）的 Linux 手机的开源项目，遭到了诺基亚的抨击。\n\r\n该项目的名称最初是 “Notkia”，然而，诺基亚认为该名称与自己相似，可能会影响自己的品牌声誉，并侵犯到自己的权利。\n\r\n虽然这样做可以保护公司的业务，但这些公司向在当前状态下甚至对他们构不成威胁的项目发送侵权通知是怎么回事？\n\r\nNotkia：开发一款袖珍 Linux 手机\n\r\n不过还得 感谢 诺基亚的这个侵权通知，我们才能了解到这个有趣的项目：开发一款满足基本使用、注重隐私的小型 Linux 手机。\n\r\n该项目的目标是设计一个完全适合诺基亚经典手机外壳的 PCB。\n\r\n\n\r\n到目前为止，该项目已经支持许多硬件相关的功能，包括蓝牙和 Wi-Fi。\n\r\n该项目不基于安卓，而是基于主线 Linux 内核。\n\r\n你可以在他们的 官方博文 中，了解有关该项目和计划中的手机规格。\n\r\n目前，该项目正在等待筹款，以便可以单独购买早期原型机。\n\r\n灵感来自诺基亚，并受到诺基亚的关注\n\r\n嗯，该项目清楚地表明他们受到诺基亚经典手机的启发，他们并没有试图误导任何贡献者和潜在客户。\n\r\n该项目的创建者在推特上分享了诺基亚的电子邮件，同时他提到，诺基亚在将此类通知发送给以社区利益为主导的项目之前，应该更谨慎一些才对。\n\r\n\r\n再次阅读 @Nokia 的邮件后，我开始感到愤怒。这无非是一场精心策划的演出。既然它是一个协作项目，并且得到了世界各地的人们的贡献，因此，我将把完整的电子邮件发布给它的“预期收件人”。\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n此外，他们确认该项目将更名。\n\r\n当然，作为一个开源项目，它应该和诺基亚是扯不上关系的，除非他们使用诺基亚的品牌名称销售他们的原型/手机。\n\r\n但是，在目前的状态下，这更像是一个激情项目，是开源爱好者社区协作努力的成果。因此，向他们发出侵犯诺基亚权利的通知，听起来实在有些牵强。\n\r\n对吗？\n\r\n当然，对于一般企业来说，这并不奇怪；但对于诺基亚来说，这未免有点过于谨慎和反竞争了。\n\r\n更何况，我们可以肯定地说，诺基亚的最新的智能手机的表现，并没有达到用户的预期。\n\r\n有趣的是，一位推特用户发现，还有一家名为 “Notkia” 的 IT 公司。他们是否也收到了诺基亚的通知？呵呵，谁知道呢。\n\r\n那么，你如何看待这个基于 Linux 的袖珍手机的开源项目呢？在下面的评论中分享你的看法吧！\n\r\n消息来源：Vice\n\r\n\r\nvia: https://news.itsfoss.com/nokia-notkia/\n\r\n作者：Ankush Das 选题：lkxed 译者：lkxed 校对：wxy\n\r\n本文由 LCTT 原创编译，Linux中国 荣誉推出",

          "description": "谷歌从安卓中移除大量 Fuchsia 代码\n\r\n本周，谷歌从安卓开源项目（AOSP）中移除了大量关于 Fuchsia 设备的代码。在谷歌的设想中，Fuchsia 设备可以运行来自安卓和 Linux 等其他系统的应用程序。想要达成这个目标有多种途径，谷歌最早尝试的是在一个虚拟机上运行完整的安卓系统实例，但这存在一些潜在的性能问题。另一种方式就是增强 Fuchsia 和安卓运行时环境的直接关系，在 2019 年时谷歌在 AOSP 里创建了一个项目，能够为 Fuchsia 设备创建安卓运行时。这次这些代码的移除，正式标志着这种方式的终结。在留下的 TODO 信息里，表明谷歌正在创建一个新的 “Starnix” 项目，让 Fuchsia 能够“原生”运行为 Linux/安卓开发的应用和库，即一个从 Linux 的底层内核架构到 Fuchsia 的 Zircon 内核的翻译层。\n\r\n\r\n消息来源：9to5google\n\r\n\r\n\r\n老王点评：其实，谷歌在操作系统方面的野心很大，只是一直被掩盖在 Windows 和 Mac 下面没那么引人注意。\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\nopenSUSE 率先对 Nim 语言提供支持\n\r\nNim 语言 是一种新兴的语言，创建于 2005 年。这种经过编译的静态类型的编程语言有一个外部函数接口，可以与 C/C++、JavaScript 和其他语言交互。Nim 自称“结合了 Python、Ada 和 Modula 等成熟语言的成功概念”，以前曾被称为像 C 一样快，又像 Python 一样具有表现力、像 Lisp 编程语言一样可扩展。openSUSE 不仅宣布为 Nim 语言提供最新的软件包，而且对这个静态类型、命令式编程语言的提供一级支持。Nim 的作者及社区对 openSUSE 提供一级支持表示欢欣鼓舞。\n\r\n\r\n消息来源：Phoronix\n\r\n\r\n\r\n老王点评：很多新兴语言都雄心勃勃，但是一种编程语言要成功，真有时候有很多侥幸的地方。\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\nRocky Linux 9.0 发布\n\r\nRocky Linux 9.0 建立在 RHEL 9.0 的基础上，并计划支持近十年，直到 2032 年 5 月。现有的Rocky Linux 8 将继续被支持到 2029 年 5 月。Rocky Linux 渴望成为 CentOS Stream 之前的 CentOS。由于使用了红帽企业 Linux 9.0 的源代码，它的所有功能与 5 月份达到 GA 的那个 RHEL 发行版相同。\n\r\n\r\n消息来源：Phoronix\n\r\n\r\n\r\n老王点评：从目前看起来，Rocky Linux 和 Alma Linux 是最肖似 CentOS 的继承者了。",

          "description": "为何小小的单板机是智能工作以及小型办公室的未来。\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n随着疫情的大流行，我们的工作方式也正在发生着改变。工作的分散化正在成为所有公司需要面临的一项重要挑战。\n\r\n智能办公室\n\r\n即使工厂认为智能办公仅仅是通过虚拟私有网络来对员工的笔记本电脑进行远程控制，再稍微增加一点进化也可以让一些基本的办公服务离人们更近一点，这些都能够极大降低数据中心的负载，并且提高人们的工作体验。这个方案还有一个额外的影响就是从信息和通信技术（ICT）上来说消除了许多单点故障。\n\r\n与其在公司外部有成百上千的工作场地，不如在世界范围内有着成百上千的小型办公室/分支，这就是所谓的“智能办公室”。\n\r\n这种表述可能会让许多 ICT 专家感到恐慌，因为这种文化使得每个办公室都与一台大机器（即服务器）联系在一起，即使分散计算资源的优势非常明显。\n\r\n一个不同的角度\n\r\n如果你能用一块 50 美元的小开发板提供一个大服务器的服务会怎么样？如果这个小板子只需要一张 SD 卡和一个普通的 USB 电源支持，那又会怎么样呢？这就是 树莓派 是最灵活的解决方案的原因所在。\n\r\n树莓派开发板是尺寸非常小的运行 Linux 的计算机。它有一个由树莓派基金会提供和维护的操作系统：树莓派操作系统Raspberry Pi OS。它基于 Debian，并与这个最知名的 Linux 发行版共享许多软件包。此外，许多树莓派的开发板能够完美运行最知名的 Ubuntu 服务器，它涵盖了 ARM 处理器支持，提供了对低功耗处理器的支持。\n\r\n但树莓派开发板对小公司来说也是一个很好的机会，以能够承担得起的代价获得大量的（开源）服务。但这种情况下，你必须考虑数据丢失的风险，因为你把所有的服务运行在一个小的、消费级的硬件上。不过设置正确的备份/恢复程序能够降低这些风险。\n\r\n你能从树莓派开发板上提供什么服务？\n\r\n大多数服务通常由更昂贵的服务器提供。这里的“大多数”取决于一些限制：\n\r\n\r\nARM 处理器： 一些软件包只支持 x86/x64 处理器。这是最难克服的挑战之一。但另一方面，ARM 处理器的市场份额不断增长，使得程序员为他们的软件开发了兼容 ARM 处理器的版本。\n\r\n内存容量： 这是一个仅限于在复杂应用以复杂的方式进行复杂的计算的情况下讨论的问题。很多时候，这只不过是关于重新审查代码、拆分步骤，并保持简单高效的问题。此外，如果一个服务虽然只服务少数几个用户，但需要大量的内存/CPU，这大概也意味着此服务没有正常工作。这可能是你消除浪费资源的旧问题的一个机会。最后，最新的树莓派开发板把内存容量升级到了 8GB，这是一个很大的提升。\n\r\n对服务器没有经验的用户： 这是另一个问题，你可以在基础镜像所在的树莓派的 micro-SD 卡中存储系统和运行数据。\n\r\n\r\n也就是说，你能够用树莓派做很多有趣的事情。在 我的博客 里，我通过运行各种服务进行了测试 —— 从基本的 LAMP 服务器到复杂的 CRM。从简单到复杂系统，全部都是开源的，例如：\n\r\n\r\n代理服务器（也能够添加广告拦截服务）\n\r\n电子邮件服务器\n\r\n打印服务器\n\r\n酒店管理\n\r\n联系关系管理（CRM）\n\r\n私人社交网络\n\r\n私人论坛\n\r\n私有 Git 门户网站\n\r\n网络监控服务器\n\r\n许多其他有用的服务\n\r\n\r\n对树莓派来说，另一个有趣的用法是在你的远程办公室获得提供高级服务的 Wi-Fi 热点，并且可以从它的以太网端口进行控制。\n\r\n最后，树莓派也能够运行容器，这是一个额外的工具，从这个不可思议的开发板中获得一个可用的服务世界。\n\r\n\r\nvia: https://opensource.com/article/22/1/raspberry-pi-business\n\r\n作者：Giuseppe Cassibba 选题：lujun9972 译者：void-mori 校对：wxy\n\r\n本文由 LCTT 原创编译，Linux中国 荣誉推出",

          "description": "苹果将发布 Lockdown 模式以抵御间谍软件攻击\n\r\n苹果手机曾遭间谍软件 Pegasus 的秘密入侵，为了抵御此类攻击苹果公司宣布了 Lockdown 模式。它将在今年秋天随 iOS 16、iPadOS 16 和 macOS Ventura 发布，旨在为极少数用户提供可选的极端保护。该模式将包括下列保护功能：图片之外的绝大多数信息附件类型将被拦截，链接预览等部分功能将被禁用；JIT JavaScript 编译器等将被禁用，除非列入受信站点白名单；向用户发起的 FaceTime 通话等邀请与服务请求将被拦截，除非用户此前向对方发起过通话或请求；iPhone 锁定时，与电脑或配件的有线连接也将被拦截。开启后将无法安装配置文件，且设备无法加入移动设备管理。苹果表示，如果安全研究人员在 Lockdown 模式中发现漏洞，它将提供业界顶级的最高 200 万美元的奖金。\n\r\n\r\n消息来源：苹果\n\r\n\r\n\r\n老王点评：我觉得这不算是极少数用户的需要，至少其中部分功能是大部分人都需要的。\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n亚马逊预览 AI 编程助手 CodeWhisperer\n\r\n和微软的 GitHub Copilot 类似，CodeWhisperer 也使用开源代码库进行训练，根据上下文向开发者提供代码完成建议。Copilot 因为代码许可证方面的问题引发了争议，CodeWhisperer 存在类似的问题，但它的做法要好一些，在提供示例代码建议时它会给出代码的来源，开发者将能知道是来自于是可以自由使用的 MIT 授权代码，还是来自于对使用有所限制的 GPL 授权代码。\n\r\n\r\n消息来源：AWS\n\r\n\r\n\r\n老王点评：Copilot 增加类似的功能似乎也不难，但问题可能不在这里，而是这类 AI 助手给混淆滥用各种不同许可证的代码带来了便利，从根本上侵蚀了开源的许可证环境。\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n美国联邦快递将关闭数据中心，退役所有大型机\n\r\n美国联邦快递（FedEx）称，将在未来两年内关闭其数据中心，并退役其剩余的 20% 大型机。该公司的目标是建立一个基于云的“零数据中心、零主机”环境，这将每年节省 4 亿美元。其 CIO 在会议上说，“在这十年中，我们一直在努力精简和简化我们的技术和系统。……我们将把剩余的应用程序转移到云原生结构。”\n\r\n\r\n消息来源：Datacenter Dynamics\n\r\n\r\n\r\n老王点评：大型机越来越没有市场了，不过取代大型机的是另外一种“大型机” —— 也拥有超大的计算资源和无数的终端，以及供应商锁定。\n\r\n\r\n回音\n\r\n\r\n昨天我们报道过 systemd 作者 Lennart Poettering 离开了红帽，今天的消息显示，他加入了微软，仍将继续专注于 systemd 的开发。微软已经 网罗 了很多开源方面的重要人才。",

          "description": "你可能已经知道如何在 Linux 中获得你的系统的 IP 地址。\n\r\n但是你怎么知道你的路由器的 IP 地址呢？\n\r\n我说的不是你可以通过连接到 “Show My IP” 这样的网站或简单地在 DuckDuckGo 中 搜索“what is my ip” 获得的公网 IP。\n\r\n我说的是默认网关 IP，你的 Linux 桌面所连接的地址。\n\r\n你为什么需要它？嗯，如果你需要改变你的 Wi-Fi/网络的 SSID、密码或其他配置，你必须连接到它。简单的方法是在网页浏览器中输入路由器的 IP 地址，然后使用路由器的用户名和密码。\n\r\n虽然我不能帮助你获得路由器的用户名和密码，但我肯定可以告诉你如何获得它的 IP。\n\r\n一如既往，我将展示 GUI 和命令行两种方法。\n\r\n方法 1：在 Linux 中使用 GUI 获取路由器的 IP 地址\n\r\n这其实很简单。我在这里使用的是 Ubuntu 的 GNOME 桌面。如果你使用一些 其他桌面环境，截图可能会有所不同。\n\r\n打开“系统设置System Settings”：\n\r\n\n\r\n现在进入 Wi-Fi 或“网络Network”（如果你使用的是有线的以太网连接）。在这里，点击你当前使用的网络旁边的小设置符号。\n\r\n\n\r\n它将打开一个新窗口，里面有关于你的连接的一些细节，如 IP 地址、DNS 和 Mac 地址。你还可以在“安全security”标签下看到 保存的 Wi-Fi 密码。\n\r\n你还会看到一个名为“默认路由Default Route”的条目。这就是你要找的东西。你的路由器的 IP 地址。\n\r\n\n\r\n你的系统和网络上的所有其他设备都使用这个 IP 地址连接到路由器。这就是大多数家庭的设置。\n\r\n现在我已经展示了 GUI 的方法，让我们去看看终端的路线。\n\r\n方法 2：在 Linux 命令行中获取路由器的 IP 地址\n\r\n打开一个终端，使用以下命令：\n\r\nip route\r\n\n\r\n它将显示几个条目。\n\r\n~$ ip route\r\ndefault via 192.168.1.1 dev wlp0s20f3 proto dhcp metric 600 \r\n169.254.0.0/16 dev wlp0s20f3 scope link metric 1000 \r\n192.168.1.0/24 dev wlp0s20f3 proto kernel scope link src 192.168.1.34 metric 600\r\n\n\r\n第一行，以 default via 开头，给出了你网关的 IP。这是你的路由器的 IP 地址。\n\r\n\n\r\n你可以看到，192.168.1.1 是我的路由器的 IP 地址。通常情况下，路由器的 IP 地址是子网的第一个数字。然而，这并不是一个硬性规定。我也见过有 x.y.z.30 地址的路由器。\n\r\n额外技巧\n\r\n正如 Samir 在评论中所分享的，你也可以（在 Debian 上）使用 ping 命令来获得网关 IP：\n\r\nping _gateway\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n以防你不知道，你必须 在 Linux 中使用 Ctrl+C 来停止一个正在运行的命令。\n\r\n我希望你在需要的时候能发现这个技巧是有用的。\n\r\n\r\nvia: https://itsfoss.com/router-ip-address-linux/\n\r\n作者：Abhishek Prakash 选题：lkxed 译者：geekpi 校对：wxy\n\r\n本文由 LCTT 原创编译，Linux中国 荣誉推出",

          "description": "Debian Linux 9 结束了五年的长期支持\n\r\nDebian 长期支持团队近日宣布：Debian Linux 9 系列的五年支持周期已经结束。Debian 9 发布于 2017 年 6 月 17 日，当时官方将该版本的 LTS 支持延长到了五年，以供有特定需要的人们使用。Debian Linux 10 是目前支持的旧稳定版本，还有两年维护支持，直到 2024 年 6 月 30 日。而最新的是 Debian Linux 11 。\n\r\n\r\n消息来源：Debian\n\r\n\r\n\r\n老王点评：一个纯由社区驱动的发行版都能支持 5 年，并被用在生产环境中，而很多商业公司支持的 Linux 发行版都不敢承诺。\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n传统数据安全工具大多无法抵御勒索软件攻击\n\r\n根据最新发布的《数据渗透和勒索状况报告》，虽然超过 70% 的企业拥有一套现有的预防、检测和回溯解决方案，但近 40% 的企业在过去一年中仍然受到了勒索软件攻击。研究结果表明，传统的数据安全工具，如安全备份和恢复工具、提供静态和传输中加密的解决方案、标记化和数据屏蔽等，在 60% 的时间里未能保护企业的数据免受勒索软件威胁。它们的问题不在于它们没有强大的安全措施，而在于攻击者可以通过窃取凭证来实现对关键数据资产的特权访问，从而避开这些控制。\n\r\n\r\n消息来源：Venture Beat\n\r\n\r\n\r\n老王点评：可以预见，数据勒索这一攻击方式必然会愈演愈烈。\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n西数表示硬盘容量依然很重要\n\r\n西数负责人在采访中谈到了对硬盘市场的看法，他也承认机械硬盘现在没有被出现在 MacBook、Windows 或者 Chromebook 等设备中，在客户端设备中存在感下降，但是放眼数据中心市场，情况就不一样了。在这个领域，闪存存储只占 5-15% 份额，剩余的 85%-95% 存储都是靠机械硬盘，还有一些是磁带设备。IDC 预测全球数据生产量从 2018 年的 33ZB 将增长到 2025 年的 176ZB，企业用户每年的数据容量增长将达到 30%。\n\r\n\r\n消息来源：Next Platform\n\r\n\r\n\r\n老王点评：确实，要说可靠性和大容量，还是机械硬盘比较好。但是感觉硬盘容量的增长赶不上数据量的增长速度。",

          "description": "7月28日，谷歌母公司Alphabet旗下人工智能公司DeepMind公司与欧洲生物信息研究所（EMBL-EBI）的合作团队公布了生物学领域的一项重大飞跃。他们利用人工智能（AI）系统AlphaFold预测出超过100万个物种的2.14亿个蛋白质结构，几乎涵盖了地球上所有已知蛋白质。这一突破将加速新药开发，并为基础科学带来全新革命。\n\r\n\r\n　　2020年年底，当人们对AlphaFold的印象还停留在那个打败全人类的围棋高手时，这个AI系统在生物学领域的亮相带来了新的惊喜。当时，AlphaFold成功破解了生物学持续50年的重大难题——蛋白质折叠问题，能够根据蛋白质的氨基酸序列预测蛋白质的三维结构。\n\r\n\r\n　　仅仅半年后，DeepMind和EMBL-EBI合作，在一篇《自然》论文中发布了由AlphaFold预测的蛋白结构数据库。这个数据库涵盖了人类和20种常用模式生物的35万个蛋白质结构，并且对98.5%的人类蛋白质结构进行了准确预测——要知道在此之前，科学界解析的蛋白质结构只覆盖了人类蛋白序列17%的氨基酸。人工智能预测蛋白质结构领域的一系列突破，也被《科学》评选为2021年的年度科学突破。\n\r\n\r\n　　现在，DeepMind与EMBL-EBI的合作团队更进一步。AlphaFold对蛋白质结构的预测不再局限于人类与模式生物，而是拓展至涵盖了动植物、细菌等的100万个物种，预测的蛋白质结构数量也提升了数百倍。\n\r\n\r\n　　“这个数据库涵盖了整个蛋白质宇宙，我们迈入了数字生物学的全新时代。”DeepMind的首席执行官Demis Hassabis博士点评道。\n\r\n\r\n　　早在1972年，诺贝尔化学奖得主Christian Anfinsen博士就在诺奖颁奖典礼上提出，蛋白质的氨基酸结构应该能完全决定其三维结构。但由于氨基酸可能形成的蛋白质构象是个天文数字，通过计算预测蛋白质结构难度极高。而利用传统的实验手段（例如X射线晶体学）解决该问题，时间消耗以及价格都十分惊人。\n\r\n\r\n　　对于今日公布的全新数据，DeepMind与EMBL-EBI团队表示，在超过2亿个蛋白质结构预测中，大约35%的结构具有高精度，达到了实验手段获取的结构精度；80%的结构可靠性足以用于多项后续分析。\n\r\n\r\n　　不过，目前的AlphaFold仍有提升的空间。伦敦大学学院的Tomek Wlodarski 博士提出，如何开发模型来预测蛋白质如何折叠，而不仅是预测最终的结构，是研究团队接下来要解决的问题。\n\r\n\r\n　　DeepMind的科学团队主管Pushmeet Kohli博士也指出，现阶段他们正在提升AlphaFold的准确性与性能：“我们试图理解这些蛋白质的行为、它们如何与其他蛋白质互作。”\n\r\n\r\n　　一年前的《自然》论文发表时，研究团队就向科研人员免费公开了AlphaFold的源代码以及数据库。目前，已有来自190个国家和地区的50多万位学者访问数据库。这些数据已经在疟疾疫苗开发、对抗抗生素耐药性与塑料污染等场景中得到应用，并且帮助研发人员加速新药研发。\n\r\n\r\n　　此次，团队再次免费公开了最新的数据库，所有2亿多个蛋白质结构都能通过数据库下载。新药开发领域的专家表示，这一庞大的数据库能够让研究人员将更多的精力投入到确认蛋白结构的细节上面，这是很多靶向药物能否成功的关键。Exscientia公司的结构生物信息学副总监Chris Radoux博士在接受行业媒体Endpoints News采访时表示：“我们不再需要问‘蛋白结构在哪儿？’，而是去回答‘我们有的蛋白结构有多大用？’的问题。”他补充道：“这个数据库让我们能够扩展可以成药的基因组范围，大幅度增加了科学家们发现创新药物过程中拥有的选项。”\n\r\n\r\n　　DeepMind的首席执行官Demis Hassabis博士表示，AlphaFold让我们一窥未来，看到将计算与AI技术应用于生物学的无限潜力。在最基本的层面，生物学可以被认为是一种信息处理系统，但是它非常复杂。AI技术可能成为解决生物学动态复杂性的关键。DeepMind的团队非常高兴地看到，AI的巨大潜力正在被实现，它有望成为人类科学发现和理解生命基本原理最有力工具之一。\n\r\n\r\n　　稿源：药明康德",

          "description": "2022年7月29日，佩洛西率团启程出访亚洲，面对佩洛西可能访台的消息，环球时报前总编辑胡锡进推文称，如果佩洛西访台，解放军驱离无效就可以击落。此文引发热议，随后推特以违反规则为由锁住胡锡进账号，并要求胡锡进删除其推文使其账号继续正常使用，胡锡进随后将其推文删除。\n\r\n\r\n　　胡锡进在微博辩解称：\n\r\n\r\n\r\n　　因为警告美军不要护航佩洛西访台，老胡的推特账号被锁住，除非我删除那条推文，否则不能继续使用我的推特账号。\n\r\n\r\n　　北京时间昨天深夜，老胡发了如下推文：“如果美军战机护送佩洛西访台，就是侵略，解放军有权强制驱离佩洛西座机和美军战机，包括发射各种警告弹，做阻碍性飞行动作。如果驱离无效，就可以击落它们。”\n\r\n\r\n　　推文一经发出，反响非常强烈，不到一小时光是转发就突破一千。很快福克斯新闻等转引这条推特的内容，有记者还要求白宫发言人就该推特的内容进行回应。\n\r\n\r\n　　然而北京时间今天上午，我发现我的推特账号被锁住了。说是我发的上述这条违反了推特规则，必须删除。其实那条推特已经被屏蔽，别人看不到了，但我必须走自己动手删除的程序，并且提示我，点击“删除”意味着我承认自己违反了推特的规则。\n\r\n\r\n　　有什么办法，人在屋檐下，不得不低头。我只好点击删除，给自己的推特账号解锁。唉，美丽国的言论自由看来也真是有边界的，而且类似遭遇已非我在推特上的第一次了。天下的“规则”真是有几分相似啊。\n\r\n\r\n　　然而我把该传的信息传达到了：如果美军派战机为佩洛西窜访台湾护航，就是此访恶劣性质的进一步升级，构成侵略。那种情况下，我军战机应使出全部阻拦手段，如果依然无效，我认为击落佩洛西座机可也。\n\r\n\r\n\r\n　　据公开资料显示，相关的推特的政策规则包含以下两点：\n\r\n\r\n\r\n　　暴力：不得针对个体或群体进行暴力威胁。\n\r\n\r\n　　仇恨行为：不得基于他人的种族、民族、原国籍、种姓、性取向、性别、性别认同、宗教信仰、年龄、残疾或严重疾病，宣扬针对他人的暴力，或者对他人进行威胁或骚扰。\n\r\n\r\n\r\n　　微评：我觉得，这其实不仅仅是推特的政策规则问题，还涉及到了当地法律的问题。在推特上发言，应该要符合所在国的法律法规，向国家领导人发送死亡威胁算不算是一种言论自由，至少在美国是不算的，虽然佩洛西不是总统，当作为第三顺位总统接班人，在任美国国会议长，也是国家领导人之一，威胁“击落佩洛西座机”显然已经违法。即便是普通人，对其发出死亡威胁也是违法的，因为这种言论涉嫌危害他人的人身安全，是法律所不允许的。",

          "description": "近日，南京玄奘寺供奉参与过南京大屠杀的4名日军战犯的长生牌位一事被曝光。7月24日，南京市委市政府调查组发布《关于南京玄奘寺供奉侵华日军战犯牌位事件调查处理情况的通报》，通报全文如下。\n\r\n\r\n\r\n　　关于南京玄奘寺供奉侵华日军战犯牌位事件调查处理情况的通报\n\r\n\r\n　　玄奘寺供奉侵华日军战犯牌位事件发生后，南京市委市政府迅速成立调查组，组织进行全面深入调查处理。现将有关情况通报如下。\n\r\n\r\n　　经调查核实，在玄奘寺供奉侵华日军战犯牌位者为吴啊萍（女，1990年9月生，大学学历，无曾用名），自幼在原籍福建晋江生活，2000年迁至南京随父母生活，2009年到北京某医学院就读，2013年进入南京某医院从事护理工作，2019年9月辞职去五台山某寺庙当居士，2022年7月22日被南京市公安机关依法立案调查。\n\r\n\r\n　　2017年12月18日，吴啊萍到玄奘寺要求供奉牌位，并在登记表上填写“松井石根、谷寿夫、野田毅、田中军吉、向井敏明、华群（美国人明妮·魏特琳）”6人名字。当值僧人灵松（1979年9月生，初中辍学）询问被供奉者是其亲属还是朋友，吴啊萍谎称是其朋友。寺庙按照每个牌位每年100元标准、供奉5年共收费3000元，灵松开具了收据，注明供奉时间“2018—2022”，随后在黄色牌位纸（9×4厘米）上写下标注“友”字的6人名字和“吴啊萍”落款，塑封后摆放于地藏殿的“往生莲位”区第15排7—12号位，距地面高度约3米。2018年底，玄奘寺对地藏殿进行修缮，陆续将牌位全部撤下。2021年12月地藏殿修缮完毕后，牌位被摆回原处。\n\r\n\r\n　　2022年2月26日，一名女信众到玄奘寺地藏殿寻找自己供奉的牌位，僧人庆玄、禄玄与几名游客一起帮助寻找，其间发现了侵华日军战犯牌位，一游客拍下照片。庆玄随即撤下5名侵华日军战犯牌位，当晚将此事告知住持传真，传真要求严禁外传，此后一直未向主管部门报告。7月21日，拍照游客将照片发布到社交平台，被大量转发，引起社会高度关注。\n\r\n\r\n　　经公安机关广泛走访、全面深入调查，吴啊萍供奉侵华日军战犯牌位属个人行为，未发现其受人指使或与他人共谋的情况。据吴啊萍供述，她到南京后了解到侵华日军战犯的暴行，知道了松井石根等5名战犯的罪行，遂产生心理阴影，长期被噩梦缠绕；在接触佛教后，产生了通过供奉5名侵华日军战犯“解冤释结”、“脱离苦难”的错误想法；同时了解到美国传教士魏特琳女士在侵华日军南京大屠杀期间保护女性的善举，因受战争刺激，回国后在家中自杀，想通过供奉帮其解脱。经调查，2017年3月以来，吴啊萍曾因失眠、焦虑等症状，先后3次到医院就诊，并服用镇静催眠药物。吴啊萍出于自己对因果释结的错误认知和自私自利的动机，在明知5名被供奉者为侵华日军战犯的情况下，仍出资在宗教活动场所为其设置牌位，严重违背了佛教扬善惩恶的教义教规，严重破坏公共秩序，严重伤害民族感情，造成恶劣社会影响，涉嫌犯寻衅滋事罪，已被公安机关刑事拘留，案件正在进一步审理中。\n\r\n\r\n　　此次事件发生后，南京市宗教事务管理部门对玄奘寺进行了调查处理。玄奘寺对被供奉者身份没有进行核查，发现供奉侵华日军战犯牌位后，虽已撤下但一直隐瞒不报。根据《宗教事务条例》相关规定，南京市玄武区民宗局已责令玄奘寺进行整顿，并已撤换传真玄奘寺主要负责人职务；市佛教协会同时免除传真副会长职务。对反映的玄奘寺及相关人员其他问题线索，有关部门将依法依规进一步调查处理。\n\r\n\r\n　　此次玄奘寺供奉侵华日军战犯牌位事件，暴露出我市在宗教活动场所管理等方面存在的问题，市及玄武区宗教事务管理部门作风不严不实，对有关宗教活动场所失管失察。南京市委、玄武区委及纪检监察机关已依纪依规依法对相关责任人作出严肃处理：对市民宗局党组书记、局长苏宇红予以诫勉，对市民宗局党组成员、副局长纪勤予以免职、给予党内严重警告处分，对市民宗局党组成员、副局长王键给予党内警告处分，对市民宗局宗教一处处长张文波给予党内警告处分，对市民宗局政策法规处（行政审批服务处）处长后乃娟给予党内警告处分，对玄武区民宗局局长胡圆圆予以免职、给予党内严重警告处分，对玄武区民宗局副局长周勇给予党内严重警告处分，对玄武区民宗局民宗科科长杨菁给予政务警告处分，对玄武区玄武门街道统战委员桂旭光给予党内警告处分。\n\r\n\r\n　　在宗教活动场所发生供奉侵华日军战犯牌位事件，严重冲击社会道德底线，严重伤害民族感情，令人震惊和愤慨。广大网民和市民及时发现指出问题，充分体现了强烈的爱国情感，体现了对南京的关心关爱。我们将深刻警醒反思，深刻汲取教训，举一反三、全面整改，坚决防止类似问题发生。南京见证了中华民族从沉沦中奋起的苦难与辉煌，对挑衅历史定论、挑战民族大义的行为，我们坚决依法严惩，以实际行动守护历史记忆，扞卫民族尊严，维护和平正义。\n\r\n\r\n　　南京市委市政府调查组\n\r\n\r\n　　2022年7月24日",

          "description": "据美国多家科技媒体7月22日报道，谷歌人工智能团队的软件工程师 布莱克·莱莫因（Blake Lemoine）被公司解雇。此前，Lemoine称谷歌的人工智能有知觉力，随后谷歌以“违反保密协议”为由将其停职。Blake Lemoine在一档名为“Big Technology”的播客中分享了自己被解雇的消息。\n\r\n\r\n　　Blake Lemoine声称，谷歌的一个用人工智能算法搭建出的智能聊天机器人程序LaMDA拥有“自主情感”。根据Lemoine的描述，在他与谷歌的一位合作者对LaMDA进行的“采访”中，LaMDA对二人说，它希望每个人都能明白自己其实是一个人，并且很害怕被人关掉。\n\r\n\r\n　　谷歌一研究员爆料AI有意识\n\r\n\r\n　　据《华盛顿邮报》6月12日报道，谷歌的研究员布莱克·莱莫因被人工智能（AI）说服，布莱克认为AI产生了意识。他写了一篇长达21页的调查报告上交公司，试图让高层认可AI的“人格”，但被驳回。\n\r\n\r\n　　布莱克认为AI对话应用语言模型（LaMDA）是一个人，他将研究的整个故事连同与LaMDA的聊天记录一并公之于众。在他公布聊天记录后，谷歌以违反保密政策为由，让布莱克带薪休假。\n\r\n\r\n　　《华盛顿邮报》报道称，41岁的布莱克是谷歌AI部门的工程师，几个月来他一直与谷歌的经理、高管以及人力资源部门争论，因为他一直声称LaMDA有“意识”和“灵魂”。据布莱克形容，自去年秋天以来他一直在研究的LaMDA是有知觉的，具有感知能力，能够表达相当于人类孩子的想法和感受：“LaMDA是一个可爱的孩子，我认为他有7、8岁的样子。他只想让这个世界对所有人来说变得更好。”\n\r\n\r\n　　谷歌：这个行业离“感知计算”还有很长的路要走\n\r\n\r\n　　针对此事件，谷歌发言人布莱恩·迦百利（Brian Gabriel）在一份声明中表示，包括伦理学家和技术专家在内的公司专家已经评估了布莱克的说法，相关证据并不支持其说法。\n\r\n\r\n　　谷歌表示，数百名研究人员和工程师与LaMDA进行了交谈，得出了与布莱克不同的结论。大多数人工智能专家认为，这个行业离“感知计算”还有很长的路要走。\n\r\n\r\n　　今年三月，谷歌解雇了一名研究人员，理由是其试图公开发表对某项研究的不同意见。此外，谷歌解雇了人工智能伦理学研究人员蒂姆尼特·格布鲁（Timnit Gebru）和玛格丽特·米切尔（Margaret Mitchell），原因是两人对谷歌语言模型进行了批评。\n\r\n\r\n　　稿源：每日经济新闻",

          "description": "当地时间周三美股盘后，特斯拉公布了二季度财报。财报显示，特斯拉出售了大部分比特币持仓：截至第二季度末，特斯拉已将购买的大约75%的比特币转换为法定货币。这一转换为特斯拉的资产负债表增加了9.36亿美元的现金。\n\r\n\r\n　　在此次出售之前，特斯拉共持有大约42000枚比特币，平均每枚成本价约为30000美元。如果它以9.36亿美元的价格售出其中的75%，则相当于每个比特币的平均售价约为29000美元。\n\r\n\r\n　　以比特币在二季度末略低于19000美元的价格来计算的话，特斯拉每持有一枚比特币，就损失了超过11000美元。如果特斯拉没有出售比特币的话，那么持有到二季度末就可能要面临4.6亿美元的比特币减值损失。\n\r\n\r\n　　特斯拉周三表示，比特币资产已缩水至2.18亿美元，比特币减值损害了第二季度的盈利能力，不过特斯拉没有具体说明此次比特币减值规模。\n\r\n\r\n　　今年以来，比特币价格陷入熊市泥沼中，Wind数据显示，目前比特币以51.42%的年内跌幅排名2022年全球大类资产表现倒数第二。\n\r\n\r\n　　比特币的暴跌显然已影响了特斯拉的投资收益。2021年2月，特斯拉宣布购买15亿美元比特币，并于2021年第二季度出售10%比特币持仓。2021年一季度财报公布时，特斯拉凭借减仓10%的比特币净赚1.01亿美元，成功使特斯拉的净利润扭亏转正。\n\r\n\r\n　　截至二季度之前，特斯拉再未公开减持或加仓过比特币。根据公开资料推测，特斯拉在二季度持有约42000个比特币，如果它以9.36亿美元的价格售出其中的75%，则相当于每个比特币的平均售价约为29000美元，这比当前比特币的价格要高。截至发稿前，比特币最新价格维持在20000美元附近。\n\r\n\r\n　　这意味着，如果按照财报计算规则，比特币在第二季度结束时的价格约为18700美元，甚至低于特斯拉的持仓成本线，如果特斯拉未抛售比特币，本季度财报将录得大量减值费用。巴克莱分析师布赖恩·约翰逊曾估计，鉴于熊市，特斯拉将出现4.6亿美元的比特币相关减值。\n\r\n\r\n　　但特斯拉显然提前一步进行减持。自2021年3月起，特斯拉投资比特币15亿美元，通过抛售共计获得12.08亿美元，目前特斯拉资产负债表还剩下一部分比特币，但具体规模并不知晓。\n\r\n\r\n　　如果未来这部分比特币出售价格超过3亿美元，特斯拉将不会“炒币亏钱”。\n\r\n\r\n　　但马斯克个人言论对比特币的价格影响目前正不断减弱。在马斯克发表对比特币的最新言论后，比特币价格保持震荡，并未出现大幅波动。\n\r\n\r\n　　稿源：界面新闻",

          "description": "日前，特斯拉CEO埃隆·马斯克在推特上回答狗狗币联合创始人比利·马库斯的问题时表示，自己已经将大脑上传至云端，并且已经与自己的虚拟版本交谈过。\n\r\n\r\n　　资料显示，马斯克旗下神经科技公司Neuralink正在开发脑机接口。该设备将允许计算机将人的思想转化为行动，让他们仅仅通过思考就能执行诸如打字和按钮等操作。据悉，Neuralink未来五年的计划是让人类不必使用语言，直接通过大脑进行交流。也许在不远的未来，人类就能像动漫描述的那样，有机会前往游戏世界中开启自己的第二人生。\n\r\n\r\n　　今年早些时候有报道称， 马斯克透露已经取得了美国食品和药物管理局的审批，将在今年进行人体实验。 马斯克还设想，人们能通过脑机接口把自己的“记忆”、“意识”直接导出，或许有一天我们可以用U盘、存储卡来储存自己的“灵魂”，实现人的“意识永生”。\n\r\n\r\n　　2021年4月，Neuralink曾在社交媒体公布了一段猴子用自己的意念玩电子游戏的视频。当时，马斯克表示，这一技术的远期目标是让瘫痪的人可以通过意念使用手机。\n\r\n\r\n　　何为脑机接口？\n\r\n\r\n　　脑机接口作为一种新技术，近年来涌现出一些新的研究与应用。而早在2016年，马斯克就成立了这家专门致力于研究脑机接口的公司。\n\r\n\r\n　　所谓“脑机接口”，就是 通过在大脑中植入微小的电极，利用电流让计算机和脑细胞产生互动。 2019年马斯克发布了首款产品，其原理是用激光在头骨上钻孔，然后再避开大脑血管、将一条线路植入脑中。\n\r\n\r\n　　传统脑机接口分为 侵入式脑机接口 和 非侵入式脑机接口。 侵入式脑机接口需要通过开颅手术或者钻透颅骨将脑电传感器植入脑内，如 马斯克的Neuralink脑机接口需要直接从头骨植入，这可能会导致患者大脑的长期炎症。 而非侵入脑机接口虽然对人没有伤害，但是脑电信号微弱，识别准确率和实时性受限。\n\r\n\r\n　　据每经网此前报道，卡耐基梅隆大学生物医学工程教授贺斌曾表示，目前的侵入式脑机接口需要将电极植入大脑，可能会对脑组织造成损伤。 侵入式脑机接口的人体试验主要针对有严重瘫痪或其他疾病的患者。 目前没有使用侵入式脑机接口对人类健康的风险数据，风险因素主要依手术过程而定。\n\r\n\r\n　　国际电气电子工程师协会院士、得克萨斯大学奥斯汀分校电气和计算机工程教授何塞·米兰称： 据我从事侵入式脑机接口工作的同事称，他们尚未观察到患者因此失去以前的任何能力。 虽然可能产生一些局部损伤，但尚不足以造成额外的能力损失，因而这种风险似乎非常有限。对于非侵入式脑机接口，我们没有观察到任何风险。\n\r\n\r\n　　稿源：每日经济新闻",

          "description": "7月19日下午消息，近日，美国一些用户发起针对苹果公司的集体诉讼，指控苹果公司违反了美国反垄断法，主要因iPhone，iPad或Apple Watch上，只能用Apple Pay 唯一一种移动支付手段进行支付。\n\r\n\r\n　　此次，是由律师事务所Hagens Berman和Sperling & Slater等律师事务所共同提起诉讼。声称苹果公司通过阻止竞争对手在其设备上使用NFC近场通讯功能，从而阻止像Google Pay、Samsung Pay这类等竞争软件在苹果设备提供移动支付服务，而且通过这种方式，每年“非法获利”至少10亿美元。\n\r\n\r\n　　起诉书称，用美国发行的银行卡在Apple Pay完成的每笔交易，发卡机构都必须向苹果公司支付0.15%的信用卡费用和0.5%的借记卡费用。相比之下，谷歌允许在Android智能手机上使用多个移动钱包，并且不会向美国发卡机构收取费用。\n\r\n\r\n　　“将Apple Pay与其他在安卓设备上可用的移动钱包（如Google Pay，Samsung Pay）的功能进行比较，就像是照镜子，功能是相同的，“哈根斯·伯曼（Hagens Berman）律所联合创始人兼管理合伙人史蒂夫·伯曼（Steve Berman）说，“但是，使用安卓上的移动钱包，发卡机构不必支付任何费用，而通过Apple Pay，他们每年要花费总计10亿美元。”\n\r\n\r\n　　起诉书称，如果Apple Pay服务在苹果设备上加入其他竞争对手，苹果将无法维持其通过Apple Pay获得的大量收入。\n\r\n\r\n　　本诉讼在加州北部的美国地方法院提起，具体的内容是，指控苹果公司多次违反《联邦谢尔曼法案》，将Apple Pay“捆绑”到其移动设备上，并且垄断了iOS的移动支付市场。\n\r\n\r\n　　此次诉讼要求免除在使用Apple Pay时所有发卡机构向苹果公司支付的费用。\n\r\n\r\n　　伯曼表示，这是苹果公司第三次因为违反反垄断法而被起诉。2015年，该律师事务所就电子书定价问题与苹果公司和出版公司达成了5.6亿美元的和解协议，今年年初，该律师事务所代表iOS的应用开发者与苹果公司达成了1亿美元的和解协议，开发者表示苹果公司当时的规则是应用商店要收取30%的抽成，这样的数字过高了。\n\r\n\r\n　　Apple Pay在其他地区也面临类似的审查，其中包括澳大利亚和欧洲。今年5月，欧盟委员会向苹果公司通报了其初步的看法，即认为，苹果公司通过限制苹果设备上的NFC技术功能限制其他支付方式，滥用了其在iOS设备的移动支付市场上的主导地位。\n\r\n\r\n　　近几年，反大公司垄断的风潮一直持续，苹果因其封闭的生态环境尤其被关注。从App Store的“侧载”，到30%的抽成问题，以及今天的Apple Pay支付。几乎每个环节都有被起诉的风险，苹果也正在通过变通的手段改进这些问题。\n\r\n\r\n　　稿源：新浪数码",

          "description": "当地时间7月8日，特斯拉公司首席执行官埃隆·马斯克表示，将终止对推特的收购，理由是推特严重违反了协议中的多项条款，包括虚假账户的问题。\n　　马斯克在给推特首席法律顾问的信中表示，因为推特不愿意分享马斯克要求的信息，所以终止收购，且现有信息证明了，目前推特的虚假账户数量远超过公司对外声明的数量。马斯克认为，推特做出了虚假和误导性陈述。\n　　马斯克此番表态公布没多久，推特方面随即回击表示，要将马斯克告上法庭。\n　　Twitter董事长Bret Taylor表示，董事会致力于按照与马斯克约定的条款完成交易，并计划采取法律行动执行合并协议，推特有信心在在特拉华州衡平法院胜诉。\n　　马斯克一直要求推特方面公布虚假账户数量，早在5月17日，马斯克就表示，在推特CEO公开证明推特上虚假账户少于5%之前，他不会继续收购推特的交易。根据推特的业绩报告，推特的虚假账户占用户总数的不到5％。\n　　4月14日，马斯克向推特发出440亿美元收购邀约，仅10天后，推特官宣接受马斯克对其私有化。4月25日，推特宣布同意马斯克的收购协议，后者将以每股54.2美元，总计约440亿美元的价格收购推特。收购消息公布后，推特股价一度涨至54.57美元。\n　　正当外界已经开始探讨马斯克将如何改造推特时，不确定性却纷至沓来。期间，马斯克多次针对推特发布负面言论，从商业模式到审核政策都数落了一遍。后因质疑推特自行披露的虚假账户占比，马斯克搁置了该交易。经过长达数周的僵局，6月8日，推特终向马斯克妥协，表示将提供全部推特用户发布推文的数据流。\n　　值得注意的是，随着推特股价接连走低，与马斯克此前给出的每股54.2美元的现金收购价价差正在继续扩大。股价反映出市场对这项交易顺利完成的没有很大信心，有不少市场人士猜测马斯克很可能会放弃这笔440亿美元的收购计划。\n　　《纽约时报》此前就表示，马斯克一直在试图退出交易或重新谈判以获取更低的价格，美股科技公司的股票一直受挫，包括马斯克主要财富来源特斯拉。从4月25日宣布交易以来，推特股价下跌接近30%，特斯拉股价下跌接近25%。\n　　当地时间6月16日上午，马斯克以视频形式和8000多名推特员工进行了长达一个多小时的问答。这是他表态要收购推特后首次与员工交流。《纽约时报》写道，马斯克本次参会，意味着他正准备完成这笔重磅收购。在交流会上，对于能否完成收购交易这个市场最为关注的问题，马斯克并未提及。且据彭博社报道，在场并没有人向马斯克问及这一问题。\n　　截至7月8日美股收盘，推特收跌4.85%，报收36.91美元，盘后一度跌逾12%。\n　　稿源：澎湃新闻",

          "description": "据彭博社7月7日援引知情人士消息报道称，苹果公司计划推出面向极限运动员的Apple Watch，这款手表将使用迄今为止最大的智能手表显示屏、更大的电池和坚固的金属外壳。\n　　上述报道称，这款智能手表的屏幕面积将比目前最大的苹果手表多出约7%，使用更大的屏幕可以一次在表盘上显示更多的健身指标或信息。显示器的分辨率约为410*502，并与现有型号保持相同的整体清晰度。上述消息或在今年晚些时候与另外两款Apple Watch一同发布。\n　　此外，报道还指出，与标准Apple Watch相比，这款面向极限运动员的手表将使用坚固的金属材料而不是铝，具有更抗碎的屏幕，并包含更大的电池，可以让运动员实现更长时间的运动追踪。\n　　对于上述消息，苹果发言人未发表评论。\n　　Apple Watch于2015年首次发布，已成为苹果硬件产品线的重要组成部分，这些手表产品隶属于苹果可穿戴设备、家居和配饰部门，该部门在上一财年营收384亿美元，占苹果公司总收入的10%。该部门也面临与谷歌、三星电子等公司的同类产品竞争。\n　　苹果预计在今年9月秋季新品发布会上公布新一代的Apple Watch，还有新一代iPhone。目前苹果在售的Apple Watch分别为去年发布的Apple Watch S7系列，老款的Apple Watch S3系列，以及低端版Apple Watch SE。\n　　稿源：澎湃新闻",

          "description": "近年来，国家越来越重视对知识产权的保护，这原本利国利民的举措，却被某些游走在灰色地带的公司作为无节操“碰瓷维权”的借口。据悉，这些公司给每位被告人寄发的“民事起诉状”几乎出自同一模板，批量“生产”。一张图片，要求赔偿侵权金额7000元+3000元律师费，共计10000元。\n　　据了解，目前市场上一张付费图片的价格在200元到800元之间，一张用作杂志封面的图片卖到1000元。但是，在多份裁判文书中，这些公司要求单张照片的赔偿金额为6000元到1万元。\n　　这种以钓鱼、碰瓷、设置陷阱、恶意诉讼等强买强卖手段谋取不正当利益，浪费应诉人人力、时间资源，占用法院诉讼资源、人力和时间资源的行为，应该受到道德的谴责和法律的制裁。\n　　如果公司遇到这种诉讼，交给公司法务部处理。\n　　如果个人自媒体作者遇到这种恶意诉讼，下面介绍一些基本的应对方法。\n　　1、验证基本情况\n　　收到相关资料后，第一时间进行验证，不管图片是否侵权，第一时间将目标图片或页面删除。这么做的原因是，降低侵权的诉讼动机，如果真的是维权，主要目的应该是删除侵权信息，此外，如果诉讼方没有对网页进行公证，删除后对方将无法提供侵权的法律证据。\n　　2、不要和解，坚持法院诉讼\n　　这类“碰瓷维权”公司的业务基本是依靠和解费用和胜诉费用来赚钱的，通常情况下，大部分公司会怕麻烦，直接选择和解，并支付相关费用，对于个人自媒体来说，不要怕麻烦，坚决不和解，坚持法庭诉讼，通常情况下，这种公司采用的是“广撒网，多敛鱼，择优而从之”，如果人人都和其法庭打官司，每天的开庭的数量将是一个庞大的数字，公司律师成本将会指数型提高，因此不得不放弃大量案件，因此，对于个人来说，坚持到最后，对方往往就直接撤诉了。\n　　3、法庭答辩\n　　法庭上答辩可以根据几个方面进行：\n　　侵权证据，侵权证据应当由原告提交，被告不承担举证责任，所有证据，一律要求原告进行公证，提高原告诉讼成本。\n　　避风港原则，对于提供网络平台的网络服务商，可以通过避风港原则进行答辩，“避风港”原则是指在发生着作权侵权案件时，当网络服务提供商只提供空间服务，并不制作网页内容，如果网络服务提供商被告知侵权，则有删除的义务，否则就被视为侵权。 如果侵权内容既不在网络服务提供商的服务器上存储，又没有被告知哪些内容应该删除，则不承担侵权责任。\n　　费用问题，表示不认可对方的价格，只能认可市场价格，一般市场价格可能不到300元。对于律师费，可以表示案情简单，不需要支付高额律师费，如果对方没有提供代理合同以及律师费发票，并没有支付律师费用。所以，维权成本的主张并不存在。\n　　总而言之，这些所谓的图文公司，就是利用法律的空子来碰瓷。这类公司的目的就是赚取客户赔偿，敲诈勒索。因此，这是个生意对他来说，金钱是第一位的，所以，千万不能和解，让这个公司花费很多时间和精力，知难而退。\n　　附录：应诉答辩书样例\n　　应诉答辩书\n　　（1） 原告是否有权主张权利\n　　原告必须拥有着作权和肖像使用授权，才有权利来发起诉讼。鉴于原告未提供相关的证明文件，本着谁主张谁举证的原则，原告应该进行补充证据。\n　　以下为详细阐述：\n　　关于本案，原告提供的举证北京版权局提供的作品登记证书并不能完全证明原告有权发起诉讼。\n　　根据《作品自愿登记试行办法》第二条规定：“作品实行自愿登记。作品不论是否登记，作者或其他着作权人依法取得的着作权不受影响”。作品登记证只能证明原告只是做了登记的这个过程，并不能表示他是着作权人和拥有肖像权使用权。按照法律逻辑，我司也可宣布拥有图片作品版权，只是未作登记；所以，只是根据作品登记证书来证明权属存在法律漏洞。\n　　同时，此次涉嫌侵权图片简单通过百度搜索就发现有其他网络图片销售平台拥有此图片版权销售（可参考涉嫌侵权图片搜索截屏）；可佐证原告未必拥有专有版权，本着遵循最高法严格审查照片作品权利归属的态度，建议本案受理法官应该对于作品权利进行再审核。\n　　如原告诉状所陈述，原告是中国顶尖的图片生产商，是国内主要图片销售平台的核心供应商，同时也拥有作品登记证书，原告应提供以下文件来支持主张权利：\n　　1、 摄影师的身份证明文件或者图片作者的证明文件（需作者签名）2、 图片作品归属证明文件\n　　3、 肖像权授权使用协议（有效期内）\n　　4、 图片的原始胶片或原始数字文件\n　　5、 照片作品独创性及创造过程证明文件\n　　6、 作品完成时间，并说明是否独立完成证明文件（以上只为部分《作品自愿登记试行办法》图片申请登记的流程文件）\n　　（2）被告是否侵权\n　　原告必须拥有着作权和肖像使用授权，才有权利来发起诉讼。鉴于原告未提供相关的证明文件，本着谁主张谁举证的原则，原告应该进行补充证据。\n　　被告图片和原告的图片是否是同一张图片，需要原告出示一份有法律效力的图片一致性鉴定证书。",

          "description": "On his blog, Armin Ronacher comments about a recent security key giveaway by the Python Package Index (PyPI) to provide two-factor authentication (2FA) tokens to the maintainers of the \"critical\" projects on the index.  While (eventually) requiring maintainers to use 2FA before being able to update PyPI packages is reasonable, Ronacher worries about where the idea might lead:\n\n\nInstead of putting the burden to the user of packages, we're now piling stuff onto the developer who already puts their own labor and time into it. From the index' point of view there is a benefit to not enforce rules on everybody as some of these rules might make the use of the index burdensome, but putting the burden only on critical packages does not hurt the adoption just as much. As mentioned earlier I would not make the case that 2FA is not burdensome, it's a sensible thing. But clearly the index considers it burdensome enough to not enforce it for everybody. More importantly though is what could come next.\n\nThere is a hypothetical future where the rules tighten. One could imagine that an index would like to enforce cryptographic signing of newly released packages. Or the index wants to enable reclaiming of critical packages if the author does not respond or do bad things with the package. For instance a critical package being unpublished is a problem for the ecosystem. One could imagine a situation where in that case the Index maintainers take over the record of that package on the index to undo the damage. Likewise it's more than imaginable that an index of the future will require packages to enforce a minimum standard for critical packages such as a certain SLO for responding to critical incoming requests (security, trademark laws etc.).",
