          "description": "One of the first things I do after installing a Linux distribution, is add to the default /etc/profile (or create and entry in /etc/profile.d/) that exports variables such as XDG[DATA,CONFIG]_DIRS, and XDG[DATA,CONFIG,CACHE,STATE]_HOME to their respective locations, based on the freedesktop.org 'basedir' specification (as outlined here: https://specifications.freedesktop.org/basedir-spec/latest/ar01s03.html).\n I do this, because after trying many different distributions, I noticed that the output of printenv did not contain these variables.\n As a user, these variables make my experience simpler. I'm not going to argue that these specifications should be followed by all, because I know there are many users who are committed to dying on the hill that is their cluttered home directory. However, the existence of these variables is not a deterrent to users who do not want to use the specification, as many applications will want to use your home directory anyway. If the existence of these variables made the specification strictly followed, projects like xdg-ninja (https://github.com/b3nj5m1n/xdg-ninja) would have no reason to exist.\n I have seen many... questionable things in various distributions' /etc/profile's, but never once have I seen one that simply exported these variables.

The Linux kernel has also been updated to version 6.4.12.\n Other significant changes include:\n - Addition of libxcrypt as a separate package.\n Previously this package was included with glibc.\n - For the sysV version of the book, udev is now extracted directly from the systemd tarball. This change also requires building the Python modules jinja and markupsafe.\n - The new package pkgconf is now used instead of pkg-config because the later packages is no longer maintained.\n - The new Python module flit-core was added as a new required dependency for the wheel module. \n The BLFS version includes approximately 1000 packages beyond the base Linux From Scratch Version 11.2 book. This release has 1543 updates from the previous BLFS version including package updates and numerous text and formatting changes.\n New in this version of BLFS is the LXQt Desktop Environment and an alternative method of building Qt with lighter dependency requirements than the full Qt package.\n DEPRECATION NOTICE: Future versions of BLFS will remove the unmaintained LXDE Desktop Environment and support for the Reiser file system (reiserfsprogs).\n source\n    submitted by    /u/rahilarious  \n [link]   [comments]",

Linux allows you to change a lot more than you can do on Windows, the Linux Terminal or Command Line can do a lot more than Windows' Command Line, you make the choices, and you can install Linux on computers that no longer run newer Window Versions. Linux does have it's hiccups however, like with Windows App compatibility and some are still scared about Linux, but Linux is doing its best to ease newcomers into Linux, and its getting better and better with Windows apps and games. Linux knows when to show its lovable personally, and with so many options one can do with Linux, it is quite mature! \n    submitted by    /u/courtney_mertz  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "由于电视盒子和智能电视的种种限制，导致很多视频无法在电视上播放，需要使用外部存储设备，例如U盘、移动硬盘、NAS等等，对于多个电视终端设备来说，移动硬盘等插拔起来不方便，使用起来易损坏，NAS搭建较为麻烦，需要额外成本，使用智能电视观看Windows 10电脑上的视频内容是一种常见的需求，下面介绍几种方法来实现这个功能。\n\r\n\r\n方法一：使用HDMI连接线\n\r\n\r\n这是最常见的方法之一。可以通过HDMI连接线将Windows 10电脑连接到智能电视上。只需按照以下步骤进行操作：\n\r\n\r\n确保智能电视和Windows 10电脑都关闭。\n\r\n\r\n将一端插入Windows 10电脑的HDMI输出端口，另一端插入智能电视的HDMI输入端口。\n\r\n\r\n打开智能电视，并切换到对应的HDMI输入源，应该能够在电视上看到电脑屏幕的内容。\n\r\n\r\n这种方法非常简单，但需要确保有一个可用的HDMI连接线，并且需要手动调整智能电视上的输入源，电视还需要支持HDMI接口。\n\r\n\r\n方法二：使用DLNA技术\n\r\n\r\nWindows 10支持DLNA（数字生活网络联盟）技术，可以将Windows 10电脑设置为DLNA服务器，然后通过智能电视访问共享的媒体内容。\n\r\n\r\n在“设置”-“网络和Internet”-“共享选项”-“网络和共享中心”里，如果媒体流未启用，则点击“启用媒体流”。\n\r\n\r\n第一，首先保证系统为Windows 7以上系统的Windows Media Player，打开“网络和共享中心”，点击左边的“更改高级共享设置”，在“流媒体”那一栏中点击“选择流媒体选项”然后点击“启用”。在弹出来的窗口中保持列表中的设备都是处于“已允许”的状态，然后点击“确定”。\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n第二，接下来打开Windows自带的Windows Media Player播放器，点击“媒体流”，勾选“自动允许设备播放我的媒体”，点“组织”-“管理媒体库”-“视频”，将电脑上的视频文件都集中在一个文件夹里，然后将这个文件夹添加到库中。\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n完成以上两步后，就可以将Windows Media Player的“媒体库”中视频通过DLNA分享到处于同一个无线WIFI网络环境中智能电视或电视盒子了。\n\r\n\r\n在智能电视或电视盒子端，打开“高清播放器”，电视会自动搜索DLNA设备，如果设置都正常，会看到提示“1个DLNA设备”，点进去，选择“视频”-“文件夹”，即可看到电脑端的共享文件，点击视频文件即可播放。\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n方法三：使用SMB共享文件夹\n\r\n\r\n共享文件夹可以使多台计算机之间实现文件的互相访问和共享，设置共享文件夹的方法是：\n\r\n\r\n找到要共享的文件夹，右键点击并选择“属性”。\n\r\n\r\n在文件夹属性窗口中，切换到“共享”选项卡。\n\r\n\r\n点击“共享高级设置”按钮，确保共享选项已启用。\n\r\n\r\n在“共享权限”中，添加需要访问该文件夹的用户或计算机，并设置相应的权限。\n\r\n\r\n在智能电视或电视盒子端，打开“高清播放器”，电视会自动搜索网络共享设备，如果设置都正常，会看到共享的电脑，点进去，选择文件夹的名称，即可看到电脑端的共享文件，点击视频文件即可播放。\n\r\n\r\n需要注意的是，共享文件夹协议是SMB，某些智能电视只支持SMB 1.0，而Windows10默认是SMB2.0协议，并且移除了对SMB1.0的支持。而这个SMB2.0协议并不向下兼容SMB1.0，这就直接导致一些只有SMB1.0协议的设备不能和电脑共享。\n\r\n\r\n解决的方法就是重新安装SMB1.0协议，安装SMB1.0协议的方法是：\n\r\n\r\n1.打开控制面板找到“程序和功能”项\n\r\n\r\n2.选择“启用或关闭Windows功能”\n\r\n\r\n3.找到SMB 1.0选项并点+号全部展开打上勾。\n\r\n\r\n上面就是三种主要的使用智能电视观看Windows 10电脑上的视频内容的方法，我个人觉得，使用SMB共享文件夹的方法最为稳定和简单，推荐使用。",

          "description": "8月15日，有摄影师发文称“自己拍的照片被视觉中国告侵权，还索赔8万多元”。事件迅速引发网友热议，“视觉中国”相关话题接连登上微博热搜榜。\n\r\n\r\n国内知名摄影师戴建峰15日在微博和朋友圈发文表示，自己今天收到了视觉中国打来的电话，称公众号侵权使用了他们173张照片，还要赔偿他们8万多元，而这些所谓的“侵权照片”竟然是他自己拍摄的作品。戴建峰表示，他的这些作品从未和视觉中国进行合作，也没传过他们图库，结果就成了视觉中国所有的版权。\n\r\n\r\n戴建峰表示，他发现视觉中国发过来的173张照片，是他这十几年陆陆续续拍的，有些曾发表在自己的公众号和微博上，但社交平台上的作品是带有水印的且非高清图。此前，他的一些作品也曾和国外图库网站有过合作，但他从未和视觉中国进行合作，也没上传照片到视觉中国的图库。\n\r\n\r\n戴建峰提供的邮件截图显示，视觉中国称：“近期我司通过监测发现，在贵司微信公众号、网站的使用场景中，未经授权使用173张我司拥有著作权相关权利的视觉作品。经在我司版权管理系统对比核查，尚未查询到上述视觉内容的任何授权记录。”\n\r\n\r\n戴建峰介绍，视觉中国给了他两个解决方案，限期8月18日之前回复。第一是双方合作，由他购买视觉中国素材库网站中的版权素材套餐，购买数量不低于已使用数量（173张）图片，图片单价每张300元，合作期限为1年。合作协议签订后，之前使用图片的责任可直接免责。第二种方案则是双方和解，由他向视觉中国支付173张图片费用，每张500元，一共86500元。\n\r\n\r\n戴建峰表示不解：“不知道我的作品怎么成了视觉中国所有的版权，还要我赔偿，干了十几年第一次遇到。”\n\r\n\r\n戴建峰介绍，他曾授权作品给朋友公司使用，朋友公司也反馈收到了视觉中国的电话，同样被视觉中国索要一定赔偿。他想知道的是，视觉中国从哪里获得了他的照片进行销售的，拿他的照片起诉了多少公司，又获得多少收益？\n\r\n\r\n15日下午，据媒体报道，视觉中国创始人柴继军回应此事称，系误会，已与摄影师取得联系。\n\r\n\r\n8月16日上午，针对视觉中国此前对于图片版权的回应，摄影师“Jeff的星空之旅”在其个人微博上再次回应称：“我不接受你们的观点。我已与Stocktrek进行核实，Stocktrek明确告知我: 视觉中国无权销售我的作品，也没有我作品的任何版权。Getty也无权将我的作品再次转授。这里没有误会，到现在，你们依然在网上非法销售我的作品，向我与他人谎称你们拥有作品的著作权并索赔。请立即停止你们的侵权行为！”\n\r\n\r\n8月16日，Stocktrek Images负责人Ryan表示，“戴建峰已经通知我们了，我正在尝试联系 Getty Images，让他们将他的图片撤下来。”\n\r\n\r\nRyan也透露了双方协议的部分关键内容。戴建峰与Stocktrek Images的协议约定，Stocktrek Images不会在中国大陆销售戴建峰的相关作品。“从现在开始，我不能再让他拍摄的照片在中国大陆境内的网站上出现。”\n\r\n\r\nRyan表示，“戴建峰与Getty Images没有关系，这些照片是通过我的公司库存获得的。实际上，Getty Images本不应将这些照片再分发给任何人，但它们将这些照片再分发给了在中国大陆的分销商VCG（视觉中国）。所以我正在联系Getty Images，尝试撤回这些照片并将其下架。”\n\r\n\r\nRyan同时也认为，视觉中国并不拥有戴建峰的这批照片的版权。\n\r\n\r\n截至16日15时收盘，视觉中国总市值较前一日蒸发超5亿元，跌至115.10亿。\n\r\n\r\n律师解读\n\r\n\r\n据界面新闻，上海大邦律师事务所高级合伙人，知识产权律师游云庭撰文表示，不少记者问我视觉中国向作者收授权费构成诈骗犯罪吗？我初步看了之后觉得视觉中国声明里说自己只有销售图片的权利，但实践中的行为却变成了图片维权，而且可能完全没有获得任何权利，有点无中生有，如果基础权利是虚构的，又有获取较大金额授权费的情况，情节严重的会涉嫌诈骗犯罪：\n\r\n\r\n1、看视觉中国的声明，他们只有图片作品销售的权利，没有图片作品的著作权授权及相应的维权权利，而在本案中，他们向图片使用者行使的是著作权维权的权利，要求对方就过往的使用行为支付每张数百元的图片授权费用。\n\r\n\r\n2、这个行为的性质是无权维权，如果是出于疏忽的，则涉嫌冒名维权，侵犯了图片著作权人的权利。\n\r\n\r\n3、如果是故意的，并且是该公司大规模普遍行为的，除了民事侵权外，则涉嫌以虚构的事实及隐瞒的真相向他人索取较大金额财物的行为，涉嫌诈骗罪。",

          "description": "近日，字节跳动旗下云计算服务火山引擎于前日推出了“TrafficRoute DNS 套件”服务，据悉，该“TrafficRoute DNS 套件”实际就是一套“公共 DNS”服务，能够在为国内用户提供更快的地址解析速度的同时，配合“流量清洗”和“IP 黑名单”等服务，抵御外界 DDoS 攻击。\n\r\n\r\n据悉，字节跳动的公共 DNS 采用 BGP Anycast 技术，字节跳动目前在全国提供多个接入点，用户发起的请求将会被转发至离用户最近的节点。\n\r\n\r\n同时该 DNS 也会缓存相应记录，当用户请求命中缓存时，无需向权威 DNS 服务器发送请求，即可快速返回解析结果，以提升地址解析速度。\n\r\n\r\n据官网介绍，火山引擎 TrafficRoute 解析调度套件提供了从公网到私网、从递归到权威的全链路 DNS 服务以及基于 DNS 的流量调度服务，包含了云解析（DNS）、云调度（GTM）、私网解析（PrivateZone）、移动解析（HTTPDNS）、公共解析（PublicDNS）。\n\r\n\r\n从官方给出的产品介绍获悉，字节跳动提供的公共 DNS 采用 BGP Anycast 技术，具有高性能、可靠、安全等特点。\n\r\n\r\n目前，字节跳动已在全国提供多个接入点，用户发起的请求将会被转发至离用户最近的节点。如果公共解析 PublicDNS 在缓存中找到了对应的 DNS 解析记录，公共解析 PublicDNS 会返回缓存的解析结果。如果缓存中没有找到与 DNS 查询请求对应的 DNS 解析记录，公共解析 PublicDNS 会进行递归查询。\n\r\n\r\n如果查询成功，公共解析 PublicDNS 会返回对应的 IP 地址。同时，公共解析 PublicDNS 会缓存该 DNS 解析记录。如果 DNS 查询失败，公共解析 PublicDNS 会返回相应的错误信息。\n\r\n\r\n公共解析 PublicDNS 不会返回错误的解析结果，也不会劫持和跳转用户请求。\n\r\n\r\n安全方面，该 DNS 使用流量清洗和 IP 黑名单等抗 DDoS 攻击方案 ，字节跳动也强调绝对不会利用公共 DNS 劫持用户。\n\r\n\r\n目前 DNS 服务只支持 IPv4 协议，主 DNS IP 为 180.184.1.1（北京），备用为 180.184.2.2（北京），仅提供基本的 DNS 解析功能。\n\r\n\r\n官网：https://www.volcengine.com/product/trafficroute",

But\n\tthis release has been going smoothly, so that's probably just me\n\tbeing paranoid.  The biggest patches this last week were literally\n\tjust to our selftests.\n\n\nHeadline features in 6.5 include\nfaster booting on large x86 systems,\nArm Permission Indirection Extension\nsupport,\nRust 1.68.2 support,\nunaccepted memory handling,\n\"mount beneath\" support for filesystems,\nthe cachestat() system call,\nthe ability to pass a pidfd via a SCM_CREDENTIALS control message,\nscope-based resource management for\ninternal kernel code,\nthe deprecation of the SLAB allocator,\nand more.

The organization has applied to become part of the Linux Foundation, \"with the end goal of having OpenTF as part of Cloud Native Computing Foundation\".  There is a GitHub repository for its manifesto, but the code repository for OpenTF is private for now, with plans to open it up in the next week or two.  Work has been going on for the last week and more developers are coming on board:\n\nSo far, four companies pledged the equivalent of 14 full-time engineers (FTEs) to the OpenTF initiative. We expect this number to at least double in the following few weeks. To give you some perspective, Terraform was effectively maintained by about 5 FTEs from HashiCorp in the last 2 years. If you don’t believe us, look at their repository. \n\n\nSome of the people behind OpenTF are participating in a Hacker News thread, so more information can be found there as well.",
