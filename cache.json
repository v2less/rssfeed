          "description": "After working with LLMs for long enough, I found myself wanting a lightweight utility for doing various small tasks to prepare inputs, locate information and create evaluators. This library is two things: a very simple model and utilities that inference it (eg. fuzzy deduplication). The target platform is CPU, and it’s intended to be light, fast and pip installable — a library that lowers the barrier to working with strings semantically. You don’t need to install pytorch to use it, or any deep learning runtimes.\nHow can this be accomplished? The model is simply token embeddings that are average pooled. To create this model, I extracted token embedding (nn.Embedding) vectors from LLMs, concatenated them along the embedding dimension, added a learnable weight parameter, and projected them to…",

Super repairable, of course.

Whenever possible, I’ve been trying to use Claude as a first pass when implementing new features / changes. But I found that depending on the type of change I was making, I was spending a lot of thought finding and deciding which source files should be included in the prompt. The need to copy/paste each file individually also becomes a mild annoyance.\nFirst, I implemented `repogather --all` , which unintelligently copies all sources files in your repository to the clipboard (delimited by their relative filepaths). To my surprise, for less complex repositories, this alone is often completely workable for Claude — much better than pasting in the just the few files you …",

          "description": "Hey HN, we wanted to share our repo where we fine-tuned Llama 3.1 on Google TPUs. We’re building AI infra to fine-tune and serve LLMs on non-NVIDIA GPUs (TPUs, Trainium, AMD GPUs).\nThe problem: Right now, 90% of LLM workloads run on NVIDIA GPUs, but there are equally powerful and more cost-effective alternatives out there. For example, training and serving Llama 3.1 on Google TPUs is about 30% cheaper than NVIDIA GPUs.\nBut developer tooling for non-NVIDIA chipsets is lacking. We felt this pain ourselves. We initially tried using PyTorch XLA to train Llama 3.1 on TPUs, but it was rough: xla integration with pytorch is clunky, missing libraries (bitsandbytes didn't work), and cryptic HuggingFace errors.\nWe then took a different route and translated Llama 3.1 from PyTorch to JAX. Now, it’s running smoothly on TPUs! We still have challenges ahead, there is no good LoRA library in JAX, but this feels like the right path forward.\nHere's a demo (https://dub.sh/felafax-demo) of our managed solution.\nWould love your thoughts on our repo and vision as we keep chugging along!\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41512142\nPoints: 68\n# Comments: 19",

          "description": "Hey Hacker News! We’re Abhi and Alex from deepsilicon (https://deepsilicon.com). We are building software and hardware for training and inferencing ternary transformer models. Here's a video of the software: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqBn-I5D6pk.\nTransformer-based models are getting bigger every generation, making the inference hardware requirements more and more expensive. Running large transformer models on device is even more challenging. Usually, they require trillions of FLOPs to run at decent speeds and use too much energy and space.\nOur solution is to train ternary transformer models. There are two advantages to using ternary values. The first is that the weights can now be stored in two bits (or even less) from 16 bits. This represents an almost 8x compression ratio for every…",

          "description": "Hey HN, this is Lina, Andrew, and Sidney from Infinity AI (https://infinity.ai/). We've trained our own foundation video model focused on people. As far as we know, this is the first time someone has trained a video diffusion transformer that’s driven by audio input. This is cool because it allows for expressive, realistic-looking characters that actually speak. Here’s a blog with a bunch of examples: https://toinfinityai.github.io/v2-launch-page/\nIf you want to try it out, you can either (1) go to https://studio.infinity.ai/try-inf2, or (2) post a comment in this thread describing a character and we’ll generate a video for you and reply with a link. For example: \n“Mona Lisa saying ‘what the heck are you smiling at?’”: https://bit.ly/3z8l1TM \n“A 3D pixar-style gnome with a pointy red hat r…",

          "description": "Hey all,\nI'm the founder of Flipt, an open-source  (https://github.com/flipt-io/flipt) feature flag tool that I (and others) have been working on for the past few years.\nAbout a year or two ago we added support for serving flag state from various non-relational declarative stores like Git, OCI, Object Store, etc.\nMany of our users came to love the git-backed storage, as it allows them to keep their feature flags close to their code in there organization's repos. But they had one (rather large) ask, and that was the ability to use the UI to manage flag state changes and still use Git as the backend.\nSo today we're rolling out our hosted solution that does exactly that (and more soon).\nI would love any feedback, questions, etc, or if anyone would give it a spin! Happy to extend the 14-day trial as well for anyone interested in providing product feedback.\nThanks!!\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41460061\nPoints: 10\n# Comments: 0",

          "description": "Hello, everyone!\nMy name is Alex, and I'm an expat in a new country. Two years ago, I moved to Germany where I didn’t know anyone. Starting the job, I realized that becoming close friends with colleagues can be quite challenging and slow. The feeling of loneliness was gradually growing.\nTo change that, I started attending various meetups based on my interests, hoping to make new friends. However, I often found myself answering the same generic questions that didn’t really help me understand if someone shared my values and interests. As a result, lost energy and 0 friends.\nSO - That’s when I began using icebreaking questions in smaller groups. Surprisingly, these questions quickly changed any conversation to a deeper, more engaging and meaningful level. I was able to identify people I genuinely connected with and started spending more time with them.\nBUT - preparing and using these questions was a pain. I would Google the top-100, pick a random number, and choose a question. I felt a strong need for a simple „one button“ that does everything for me.\nAND - After searching and not finding such a solution, I decided to build it myself. I created a vast database of questions across various topics and integrated AI to generate questions on any subject.\nThe idea has resonated well within my communities (university and expat parties), and more people are starting to use it. I’d love to hear your stories with icebreaking questions, your experience, and your feedback so I can make the service even more useful for more people!\nCheck it out and share your thoughts!\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41438542\nPoints: 17\n# Comments: 6",

Here’s a quick demo: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9n_eY-fM_E.\nWhy we’re doing this: Mechanical engineers excel at generating initial design concepts but get bogged down translating ideas into final designs due to tedious, repetitive tasks. Our goal is to automate these mundane processes, allowing engineers to focus on the creative aspects of design.\nHaving worked at multiple hardware companies—from medical devices to space launch vehicles—we know how often “trivial” components such as manufacturing rigging, get brushed under the table in scheduling conversations.  These tasks aren’t necessari…",

The settings closely follow html/css. We think an open canvas is a big improvement over other website builders. Everything is easier: styling, consistency, responsiveness…\nBut making it work was hard! We thought HN would appreciate the tech behind it:\n- A custom WebGL rendering engine (w/text, shadows, blurs, gradients, & opacity groups)\n- A partial implementation of the css spec\n- A custom text editor & text shaper\n- A transformer to turn designs into publishable html/css\nRepaint is a design tool for html/css.

This is an open source plasmid and vector (Short, often circular segments of DNA) editor, with features related to primer quality checks, PCR cloning, and protein analysis. I plan to add more restriction-enzyme-based features in the near future. It has some extras like a solution-mixing helper, automatic feature annotation.\nFrom a technical standpoint, this is a standalone binary written using the EGUI library in rust. A project goal is performance, with small memory footprint, and small application and file sizes.\nThis is a continuous work-in-progress, and I'm open to any and all feedback, criticism, and requested features.\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41435409\nPoints: 81\n# Comments: 20",

Basically, it wants to solve the problems encountered with current solutions:\n- slow typing\n- not easily configurable\n- keyboard layout dependent\n- constant bugs\nAdditionally, Afrim offers the following features [1]:\n- Dataset easily customizable\n- Keyboard layout independent\n- Auto completion, autocorrection and autosuggestion\n- Support all sequential codes\nTechnical details [2]:\nAfrim is written in Rust and his architecture is inspired of RIME.\nWhat's next?\n- Offer an android frontend of the Afrim (in development) [3]\n- Support more African input methods as possible\nI would like to have your opinions about this project. I have been working on it so far, and I would like to know how I can improve it.\n--------------\n[1] https://github.com/pythonbrad/afrim?tab=readme-ov-file#featu...\n[2] https://pythonbrad.github.io/afrim-man/for_developers\n[3] https://github.com/pythonbrad/afrim-keyboard/\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41427563\nPoints: 80\n# Comments: 33",

          "description": "Hi HN, We're excited to share repo2vec: a simple-to-use, modular library enabling you to chat with any public or private codebase. It's like Github Copilot but with the most up-to-date information about your repo.\nWe made this because sometimes you just want to learn how a codebase works and how to integrate it, without spending hours sifting through the code itself.\nWe tried to make it dead-simple to use. With two scripts, you can index and get a functional interface for your repo. Every generated response shows where in the code the context for the answer was pulled from.\nWe also made it plug-and-play where every component from the embeddings, to the vector store, to the LLM is completely customizable.\nIf you want to see a hosted version of the chat interface with its features, here's a link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNVzmqRXUCA\nWe would love your feedback!\n- Mihail and Julia\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41383592\nPoints: 22\n# Comments: 3",

          "description": "Hello HN!\nMy name is Patrick, and I am a junior at my High School’s FRC robotics team FRC 341 “Miss Daisy” (yes named after the movie). Every year, during the first weekend in January, a new robotics game is released (no it’s not battlebots). The game could be about launching balls into a goal, climbing monkeybars, or placing cubes on a see-saw. This year we were challenged to build a robot that could shoot orange foam donuts into a goal about 6 feet in the air. Here is a yt video with the game animation https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9keeDyFxzY4&t. After we received the game we then had six weeks to design, build, program, and field a robot capable of playing the game. And we did pretty well this year! I have attached a ChiefDelphi thread (robotics forum) where we have released our season materials. This being our CAD (3D model of robot), code, and design binder. I encourage you to take a look and leave any questions that you may have.\nThanks a lot!\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41340874\nPoints: 17\n# Comments: 6",

It’s basically like TurboRepo but without the task runner. The tool builds a dependency graph between packages, allowing you to do things similar to what you can do in TurboRepo, like \"only test the packages and the packages that depend on them, compared to the main branch,\" or \"only install dependencies for Package A and its dependencies,\" etc. I use native go tool to get dependencies and create dependency graph between the package.Nothing crazy but I feel it could be useful.\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41332011\nPoints: 5\n# Comments: 0",

Here’s a quick demo video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bf-xTsDT5FQ. If you want to try it out directly, there are instructions below.\nWith Moonglow, you can start and stop pre-configured remote cloud machines within VSCode, and it makes those servers appear to VSCode like normal Jupyter kernels that you can connect your notebook to.\nWe built this because we learned from talking to data scientists and ML researchers that scaling up experiments is hard. Most researchers like to start in a Jupyter notebook, but they rapidly hit a wall when they need to scale up to more powerful compute resources. To do so, they need to spin up a remote machine and then a…",

For a basic CRUD app you need to spin up servers, wire up endpoints, integrate auth, add permissions, and then marshal data from the backend to the frontend and back again. If you want to deliver a buttery smooth user experience, you’ll need to add optimistic updates and rollbacks. We do these steps over and over for every feature we build, which can make it difficult to build delightful software.

It effectively turns computer programs into Lego bricks, to be torn down into pieces and reused into something new.\nIt supports the COFF and ELF object file formats, for the x86 and MIPS architectures. It has been successfully used on Linux, Windows and PlayStation executables. One user report is on a commercial video game from 2009 with a ~7 MiB Windows executable written in C++: it was delinked without its C runtime library and then relinked into a new executable at a different base address, with no visible change in functionality, as a prelude to a decompilation project.\nUse-cases I've demonstrated on my blog include modding, making software ports, converting executable file formats, creating libraries... I've originally built this as part of a video game decompilation project ; I've been working on this over the past 2.5 years and recently it has started gaining some users besides me.\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41318133\nPoints: 195\n# Comments: 32",

It's a .NET library designed to manage in-memory tree structures, including items, directories, and symbolic links.\nVirtualStorageLibrary is a .NET library that operates entirely in-memory and provides a tree-structured collection. This library offers a foundation for managing hierarchical data structures, supporting items, directories, and symbolic links that encapsulate user-defined types  (generic types defined by the user). This library is not a file system. Instead, it was redesigned from scratch to create a more flexible and user-friendly tree structure.

We’re Towaki and Allen, and we’re building Outerport (https://outerport.com), a distribution network for AI model weights that enables ‘hot-swapping’ of AI models to save on GPU costs.\n‘Hot-swapping’ lets you serve different models on the same GPU machine with only ~2 second swap times (~150x faster than baseline). You can see this in action through a live demo where you try the same prompts on different open source large language models at https://hotswap.outerport.com and see the docs here https://docs.outerport.com.\nRunning AI models on the cloud is expensive. Outerport came from our own experience working on AI services ourselves and struggling with the cost.\nCloud GPUs are charged by the amount of time used. A long start-up time (from loading models into GPU memory) means that …",

          "description": "Hello!\nI recently wanted to learn a bit about computer vision. Initially, I wanted to build something which could solve a jigsaw puzzle, but figured I should start with something (much) simpler, so I've built this instead.\nThis is a visual Sudoku solver which runs in the browser. It works by using OpenCV to identify and process the Sudoku grid, passing this to a simple ML model to identify the digits, and then solving the puzzle with a backtracking algorithm. The ML model was trained on the TMNIST data set using a model built with Keras, also a completely new area to me.\nIt's far from perfect, and doesn't like non perfectly lit or overly warped puzzles, but the main goal here was learning, which I did, a lot.\nAs this was primarily a learning project, I've tried to document my approach as much as possible, which can be found in this Python notebook:\nhttps://github.com/Taiters/sudoku-solver/blob/main/notebooks...\nI used Python while exploring OpenCV and training the models etc, and eventually ported this over to web (OpenCV.js + Tensorflow.js) to get something I could actually share with people.\nFeel free to have a dig around the source or play around with the solver!\nGithub: https://github.com/Taiters/sudoku-solver\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41299594\nPoints: 37\n# Comments: 10",

Now granted, I don't really know anything about photo editing or graphic design but based on what I read from people who do graphic design professionally, GIMP just isn't up to snuff as far as features and workflow even with the new 3.0 coming. \n I learned about Photopea a couple years ago and it looks a much better alternative to Photoshop as far as workflow and features (CMYK, smart objects, AI features). The issue I see people might have it with it is it being web based and proprietary though it does edit your photos offline and is big on privacy.\n With all this in mind, for graphic design people wanting to switch to Linux should we be steering them more towards Photopea rather than GIMP despite it being proprietary and web based?\n Keep in mind I ask this as someone who knows next to nothing about graphic design or photo editing, just a huge Linux enthusiast so I would be very interested to hear thoughts from people who know more than me and/or have used both Photoshop and Photopea.\n    submitted by    /u/jmantra623  \n [link]   [comments]",

It’s just annoying. I guess it comes down to security? Would tethered connectivity be easier and more open in Linux? All I want to do is have some basic bare bones software automatically copy certain new files when it’s connected — but otherwise leave me alone :-) with windows it seems like I need special software to accomplish what I want = extra complicated.

When I got it, I immediately noticed this little display on the top of the PC, the XPS Miniview. I realized it didn't have any driver support past Vista and I disabled it and haven't thought about it until now. I'm wondering if there's a way to display content like the local IP, stats and usage, uptime, etc. on the display, and how I could go about doing that. Also if it's possible to get those arrow keys working... If anybody has any knowledge I'd appreciate it. Thanks for reading!\n TLDR: Home server has a tiny screen on top.

Imagine international-level internet outage caused by kernel bug. Linux community would be instantly die after that 😓\n So please stop... stop playing victim on each other.\n For Rust enthusiasts, if you think maintainers who still use C are resisting to give a \"good documentation\", that means they expect you to learn how those C source codes work then write a good Rust code from those. Same as when C devs are tried to learn how to code C based on reverse engineered binaries, or a hardware datasheet if lucky. Nothing is easy, no one want to spoon-feed you except you're a toodler.

I want to move away from Windows and macOS in my personal use cases. I've been experimenting with different distros and a couple different DE's and WM's, and I'm struggling to settle on anything. I've tried Arch and I've tried NixOS, Hyprland on both, KDE on both, but I want something that isn't going to be a complete slog setting up. My goal is to build an environment that's entirely my own that's fully functional.\n Arch is great, I like the idea of starting with a minimalist build and going from there. NixOS is also great, I love the idea of (potentially) a single configuration file, the self-contained package system, and the ability to roll back changes, but my config file is getting to be a behemoth, and I'm getting the feeling that it's a better server distro than desktop.\n I would like to be able to game and develop (I want to learn Rust or build a game with Godot), and I also have taught myself how to use Photoshop/Gimp and would like to be able to do that.\n So what are your thoughts?

What I think can help will be a community effort to make a one-stop destination for such recommendations. The inspiration for this post came to me after I saw the anime recommendation flowchart in r/anime.\n As a fellow Linux user for the past year, I definitely agree with whoever that says there isn't a one-size-fits-all solution for any of the aforementioned necessities, and the customizability is what gives Linux the advantage. But I also think that it's equally important to bring attention to promising software so that they'll receive more support in the form of issues, feedback and PRs, and it will eventually help improve the Linux experience altogether.\n Ofcourse what I'm implying is a good starter pack, so that the user can slowly try out others as they understand what they feel is lacking in their current software, and give feedback to the software on the way.\n    submitted by    /u/NoCoolSenpai  \n [link]   [comments]",

However, I very seldom hear any people talk about it - very unknown. \n I find it is the closest Analog you can have on Linux (without fidgeting with Bottles/Wine) to something like Clip Studio in feel and workflow; though not features sadly.\n Krita is still decent but, it has it's own quirks so I always struggle to really use it long term. Linearting just does not feel as responsive on equivalent hardware. Fantastic for Painters though - but lacking for comic and Cellshading styles imo; in big part cause of weak selection and fill tools that I heavily use in such - lack of a \"Gap closing\" function being a big pain in the arse. Paintstorm pretty much solves all of that, I can go about just as fast as in Clip without having to do any manual adjustment.\n Only dealbreaker for some might be that Paintstorm is not FOSS - but well worth the cheap price tag to me.

          "description": "Hey everyone, \n A while back, I posted my Arch Linux guide covering full disk encryption with LUKS2, LVM2, Secure Boot, and TPM2 unlocking. For those who haven't seen it, the guide is here: Arch Linux install guide.\n Recently, someone pointed out a vulnerability in the setup that could allow an attacker to mimic the root partition using the same UUID to boot a rogue OS, then query the TPM for the decryption key.\n I've updated the guide with instructions on how to secure against this. If you're using TPM unlocking, I highly recommend checking out the update to make sure you're protected.\n Basically, how the protection works is by using systemd-measure to precalculate the hash value that's expected in the PCR 11 of the TPM during a specific boot phase enter-initrd. The boot process has several phases. And during each phase , the PCR11 is extended with the hash of the new phase. \n Now during boot , during the enter-initrd phase, the TPM checks for other values in PCR 0 , 7. It also checks that the value in the PCR11 matches the precalculated value by systemd-measure, and releases the key. After the enter-initrd phase, comes the switch-root phase. This extends the PCR11 again. Now if an attacker tries to query the TPM from the rogue OS, he will fail, because the PCR11 value doesn't match the precalculated value.\n Thanks to everyone who has supported the guide so far! If you find it helpful, a star on GitHub would be greatly appreciated.\n    submitted by    /u/_d3f4alt_  \n [link]   [comments]",

But for my job, occasionally I need to run full-fledged Word or Excel, and I'm used to PaintNET and Affinity Photo for high quality image editing that I do for publications, I also really like Wondershare Filmora video editor. I am debating which is the best alternative and wondering what other Linux users do in this situation?\n Dual-boot? A hassle having to jump back and forth between the two OS, not to mention having to keep up with Windows updates. I'd rather forget Windows exists as native OS.\n Wine/Proton? As of 2024 it still seems a convoluted process, pollutes your distro with Windows executables and libraries (eww) and of course there are no guarantees the specific app needed will run.\n Local virtual machine? - Not ideal if you are using a laptop on battery often as the performance overhead will drain the battery faster, also it just feels slow and thefore annoying to use.\n Cloud virtual machine? I never tried it before, I wonder what's the performance like, but surely it requires adding a monthly expense.\n RDP into a Windows PC? This is the one I am most inclined to, even though I don't have a separate desktop PC right now, but I tried Parsec to someone else's laptop and it really has low latency streaming if the connection is good, it's quite usable, more so than a virtual machine.\n Any other possibilities I am missing?\n    submitted by    /u/vanwaldi  \n [link]   [comments]",

I liked the overall experience, it was nice to have a (slightly) updated version of KDE 3.x, and AMAZING to have a fully-functional Konqueror back. I was, however, a little put off by what appeared to have been rather arbitrary changes. What I didn't realize (gimme a break, I've been away from Linux for seven years) was that the q4OS Trinity was far from vanilla; in fact, the q4OS folks were kinda going out of their way to make it as close as possible to a legacy Windows experience, which explained a few things. Someone here suggested I try PCLinuxOS. Ok, yeah, there's a community build with Trinity, which I installed first thing this morning. Guess what; it's broken. Yeah, it installs and loads a …",

          "description": "One major issue with Linux distributions is that for each piece of software, there's a package for Debian, Arch, Fedora, Ubuntu, etc. Binaries are usually compiled dynamically linked (as opposed to statically linked), which means the libraries aren't contained in the binaries themselves, rather they're linked to system libraries. Therefore, you can't just run a binary from your Arch system on a Debian-based system. Many people say the solution to this issue is Flatpak, Snaps, and AppImages. These don't really address the real problem though. The actual solution is compiling statically linked binaries. This would also make it easier for developers to make binaries for Linux knowing they can be ran on any distribution.\n    submitted by    /u/SaltyMaybe7887  \n [link]   [comments]",

How it's so customizable to your like and taste. I'm not really a fan of Windows, I gotta admit. But so far, the advantages of Windows over Linux still kinda make me hesitant to really make the switch. Yeah, gaming is very doable now thanks to software advances with programs such as Wine and Steam's Proton. But unfortunately, some games still don't run on Linux, or they do, but not flawless. Especially multiplayer games which use anti-cheat software. Unfortunately some or most of them are apparently borderline malware, with how deep they can be nestled/rooted in the OS once installed. I've got an Nvidia graphics card, and though I found out there are linux drivers for them, I'm not sure how good it is compared to Windows. On my pc I've got Nvidia GeForce experience which neatly notifies me when there's a driver update. If I don't get a notification I just don't update. I don't want to manually check for updates every time I boot up my pc. Also I've already got plenty of stuff installed on my pc, and I'm not exactly thrilled if I have to reinstall all of it, if I switch to Linux. So far Microsoft haven't really done anything that I know of that made me determined to switch to Linux.\n    submitted by    /u/SpaceSloth707  \n [link]   [comments]",

Within this time-frame I used mostly openSUSE Tumbleweed and the latest Fedora.\n Well, the first laptop died within 3 years, and had some weird CPU spikes, and resume from suspend was hit or miss. Also I had to deal with broadcom drivers constantly breaking with kernel updates.\n The second laptop had frequent freezes causing the session to hang and require cold reboots. I tried several solutions and kernel parameters but the issue remained to this day. \n The third laptop, with RX dGPU, constantly flickers when connecting to a external FreeSync 144hz display.\n My most recent purchase was finally a Intel laptop with Xe graphics (LG Gram), and behold, I have none of these issues at all. Wayland, suspend and resume, external displays, battery runtime equal to Windows, all works great. It might be just luck with this particular model but honestly it made me regret my past purchases.\n Since then I have learned more about Intel active and timely contributions to the Linux kernel and I am hoping the layoffs won't cause that to decrease.\n Either Intel has been improving a lot these last few years or AMD has been overhyped, but the hassle free experience with a Intel laptop has made me hesitant with going to AMD+NVIDIA on my next desktop build, I am Seriously considering going with Intel CPU+Arc GPU.\n    submitted by    /u/vanwaldi  \n [link]   [comments]",

It was one of the earliest kde 6 adopter and latest kernel is great for how rapidly gaming is growing on Linux. They also do some testing before shipping the updates and it's the default os that ships with their hardware so you can be sure it'll work. Wayland is used by default. Flatpak and nvidia drivers are pre-installed. Snaps are removed (I know they're preferred for servers but majority don't like them on personal computers so this is still a plus).\n What do you guys think about it?\n Edit: They're also KDE patron and organize their events in Tuxedo offices, i think that's pretty nice.\n    submitted by    /u/nikunjuchiha  \n [link]   [comments]",

Sadly killed by some dubious business decisions.\n Android dominates the World right now and while it uses a Linux kernel, the userland is quite foreign. Some un-Googled ROMs like GrapheneOS are great, but still not the same thing as a true Linux system.\n I thought Linux on mobile was pretty much dead, but I have been test driving SailfishOS on an old Sony device and I am really impressed. It is very practical, and a little Android emulation layer makes it possible to use most Android applications as native, in case that is needed.\n Desktop Linux is truly great these days.

I switched to linux because of cfd being faster in linux and because of technologies like docker, lxc and chroot. In addition, I had some amazing fun playing with linux on my phone via termux too. I still dual boot windows, but I'm slowly just using linux for most things. So effectively I'm in the windows --> linux camp. I see myself most comfortable with kde and I enjoy themes that compliment that workflow.\n However I've known friends who prefer gnome and use macOS like themes, and not so surprisingly is also from a MacOS --> Linux camp. So this got me thinking, can the choice of someone's preferred DE and theme be a good indication of where they are switching from?\n Please share your thoughts on the matter! Let me know (if you dual boot or fully switched) what OS you used to use before coming to linux and if you have a prefered DE and theme?\n Thanks 🫡\n    submitted by    /u/EternalSeekerX  \n [link]   [comments]",

I am a 3D artist studying computer animation in university, with a mostly Mac background who switched to Windows on the desktop because I built a gaming PC. I was getting more and more frustrated by Windows 11 because of how unstable it is getting for me. I decided to try Linux out after watching some behind the scenes videos of Pixar and Disney animating their movies and seeing that they use Linux machines to make their films. I was going \"wait, whut?\" I grabbed a spare laptop in the house and installed Fedora on it and played around and was having fun. I chose Fedora because Linux I wanted to run RHEL due to how my favorite programs like Maya, Blender, …",

          "description": "I use a pretty nice gaming laptop from 2022. I was running Windows 10 for most of its life. And you could tell it wasn't happy. Maybe it was fine at the start, but recently it got to the point of reaching ~90°C just to LOAD the damn OS and like 60-70°C at idle on a good day. When I heard all the telemetry news, and when i saw how badly my laptop was taking windows, i had enough. It also helped that I'm a developer and switched to vim/nvim (still not sure which one i like more), and i use git bash all the time. And getting that to run on windows is just a hassle. On linux it's a breeze. Not to mention being fed up with the lack of customization for keybinds and general appearance.\n I spent one day. Backing up all my stuff. And then booted linux mint from a USB. Installed it, fiddled with the drivers/kernels (it still has some graphics/display issues unfortunately :/) and MAN... My Laptop hit record low temps, 50-60° idle, one time i saw even 43°! Everything is so quick to load and work with. Loving the command line way of doing things as well. I love the sense of security and calmness that comes with it all. I just feel at ease again. And i can focus on my work.\n I had to keep windows as dual boot unfortunately because of stuff required by my organizations. But still, I was able to allocate 280 gigs for linux and it runs like butter. Thank you ❤️\n    submitted by    /u/flagboi747  \n [link]   [comments]",

I came from windows as my daily driver and used Wallpaper Engine for this and was hoping to find a way to emulate that on my linux machine.\n I didn't want to have to go out and find downloads for videos to turn into wallpapers myself so I build a script that taps into the workshop directory of steam for Wallpaper Engine (installed using proton) and migrates them to Komorebi by making configs and extracting a frame for the thumbnail.\n This allows me to launch the wallpaper engine UI and use it to find wallpapers I want and then migrate them on demand.\n Obviously there will likely be bugs but I'm pretty proud of it.\n I put it up in my public repo and I'm going to continue to improve it where I can. If this is something you're interested in trying here's the link. Included a short video here to show the various wallpapers I pulled into Komorebi from Wallpaper Engine.

          "description": "Hey r/linux,\n Nano is installed on most Linux systems nowadays since it has replaced vi as the default text editor in most distributions for years now. That means most of us are probably using it quite frequently, possibly without even thinking about it when it is called by default (e.g., when using visudo, or when editing a commit message for a git merge operation on a remote host we SSH'd into), but also some of us may be explicitly using it to edit remote config files, editing file as root even locally, or maybe even for programing?\n I actually do use it to program when I'm live coding in front of my students, because I can open it in tmux which allows me to have the same editor on my laptop's screen and on the big display my students see without having to duplicate screen so I can have other notes for myself for example (also, it's good for them to see that it is possible even in 2024 to code using simple tools that runs on your own computer rather that editing files directly on GitHub or wherever…).\n Because of that, I came to realize what an under appreciated gem nano actually is. Recent discussions on HN and here lead me to wonder how to showcase and discuss nano's features, so I thought why not share our .nanorc files?\n I'll copy mine in a comment below :).\n For those of you who never bothered to customize nano, be sure to check the `nanorc` man page, and to not miss its \"REBINDING KEYS\" section which lists the various and sometimes quite advanced editing functions most people ignore that nano has: syntax highlighting, line numbering, auto-indent, multi buffers, mouse support, keyboard macros, …\n So, do you use nano?

So the title is intended as a colloquialism and not so much click bait. In candor, I think this is the tech fad of the month, Linux talk will slow down back to normal and maybe a marginally faster mid term growth. Linux being at 5.2% in 18 months is optimistic, but not unrealistic.\n There is so much pro-Linux and anti-Windows talk in tech communities that aren't even Linux or SOG centric, sure Level1techs made benchmarks, but a lot of other outlets are referencing it. Tom from \"Moore's Law is Dead\" says the Linux Desktop readyness is will be there in 5 to 10 years and we might be there by then and I expect somebody like him to be more skeptical than he was. Tom's Guide (different Tom) installed SteamOS on The ROG Ally X and there was better performance and battery life and DankPods. This is anecdotal, but I follow a variety streamer that I don't think I heard her talk about Linux ever and she tried streaming a Vtuber setup that uses Unreal Engine and heaven knows what and she streamed from the Deck from Proton and it was very choppy and I said \"I think DXVK is compiling shaders and the more you do those effects, the bigger shader cache you'll get and it will stop chopping\". The stream eventually crashed, but considering it's a handheld and it's going through all that translation, I'm surprised it ran that well even though it crashed.

I stumbled upon this aritcle. As per article - \n By default, the apt upgrade command removes old versions of installed or upgradeable packages on the system that are no longer needed when upgrading.\n In contrast, the apt-get upgrade command does not. This efficiency can make apt upgrade better for freeing up system memory.\n I don't think this is the case. The packages \"no longer needed\" can only be removed with autoremove subcommand after both. There is no auto removal of anything. \n https://preview.redd.it/cqio2hlkoeld1.png?width=1790&format=png&auto=webp&s=2534fd849a54c8b9925b5727f1b3f94e006ca80e\n    submitted by    /u/marathi_manus  \n [link]   [comments]",

I even felt like I had to be serious when navigating on this OS. Now, I'm trying to RICE it and am excited to share my desktop with you soon.\n What set my mind on changing the OS was how incredibly boring windows was, and I heard linux was good for software developers.

Finally I can have a almost 90% keyboardbased workflow, not having to deal with terrible laptop touchpads. \n It did take me almost 3 full working days and 2 reinstalls to get it up and running in a proper way. Been fighting with wifi drivers, fixing suspend for closing the lid etc. But it’s finally up and running. Batterytime doubled, runs cool and no fans suddenly spinning for no apparent reason. ChatGPT has been the biggest savior for getting it set up. It spews a lot of garbage and confidently tells you wrong instructions, but for basic setup it seems to hit the mark with a far higher accuracy than browsing rude forum posts from 2009. \n Debian w/ i3 is obviously still terrible at being user friendly, and almost everything is a hassle the first couple of times, but at least you feel respected as a user. \n    submitted by    /u/kunstner0  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hey everyone! I ran into a funny (and slightly stressful) situation while installing Ubuntu on my Raspberry Pi 5, and I thought I’d share it here. Maybe it’ll help someone, or at least give you a good laugh.\n So, I’ve got a Bluetooth mouse and a Bluetooth keyboard. But, as it turns out, during the Ubuntu installation, they’re pretty much useless because the keyboard won’t connect. I ended up stuck on the screen where you need to enter your username, computer name, and password. And that’s when I realized—without a keyboard, I’m totally screwed. 🤦‍♂️\n After digging through some old boxes, I managed to find an ancient wired mouse—my savior (well, almost). The first steps of the installation, like choosing the language and localization, went smoothly, but then came the part where I had to type stuff… and that’s where things got tricky.\n I started frantically Googling for a solution on my phone, and then I accidentally noticed that I could highlight the text labels in the form fields. Right-clicked, and boom—there were options to “Copy” and “Paste.” That’s when it hit me! I started copying and pasting letters and words from these labels to fill in all the fields.\n One letter at a time, one symbol at a time, but I finally made it through the installation! 😅\n Afterward, I managed to get the Bluetooth keyboard working, and everything was fine. But this experience is something I’ll definitely remember for a long time.\n So, if anyone ever finds themselves in a similar mess—don’t give up! There’s always a way out. And big thanks to my old wired mouse for saving the day. 🖱️\n    submitted by    /u/Ktyby  \n [link]   [comments]",

For tasks like coding and SQL queries, and our web-based front end tools, Linux is fine. Not really any better than Windows, but not holding me back. However, my org is heavy into the MS ecosystem, and that's where the issues arise. \n Web based office sucks. It's workable for basic word and excel tasks, so I figured I could use that and a VM for more complex tasks. Which I could, but it's nowhere near as seamless as on a Windows machine (where I never work on any Office docs in a browser). Web based outlook kind of sucks, and Thunderbird just doesn't offer the full outlook experience with the multiple calendars and inboxes I have to manage.\n The other issue is I would have to ditch Google Drive. Self-Host seems the way to go for this. There are downsides with this as well, unfortunately.\n    submitted by    /u/120m256  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I found a way of making Chromium-based browsers use hardware video acceleration when running on Wayland-native mode and using Intel graphics. Please note this tutorial won't work on X11 (I'm pretty sure it should work out of the box on X11 on Intel graphics). This has been tested on Chromium 127, using MESA 24.1.6 on Plasma 6.1.4 Wayland and Fedora 40, using Intel Ice Lake graphics (10th generation). This will likely work for other Chromium-based browsers, like Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge, Opera, Vivaldi, etc.\n All you need to do is to enable the following arguments:\n --ozone-platform=wayland --enable-features=VaapiVideoDecodeLinuxGL,VaapiVideoEncoder --ignore-gpu-blocklist\n On Plasma, you can use the Menu Editor application to add those arguments to the \"Command-Line Arguments\" field (append them at the end), after that, all you have to do is to save your changes and restart your browser. On other desktop environments you might have to edit the Exec line on the .desktop shortcut of your browser, usually located either in /home/your_username/.local/share/applications/ or /usr/share/applications/ (you can use sudo nano /usr/share/applications/browser_name.desktop to edit the files there, or another editor with root support of your choice)\n To confirm it's working, you can install the intel-gpu-tools package for your distribution (sudo apt install intel-gpu-tools on Ubuntu, sudo dnf install intel-gpu-tools on Fedora, and so on) and run sudo intel_gpu_top, then, play a video and check in the terminal if the video usage percentage goes above zero.\n I hope that helps!\n    submitted by    /u/Cleytinmiojo  \n [link]   [comments]",

Works.\n Game performance? Equal or better in my case.\n I never expected to run into problems with python and i didnt visual studio works good too.\n Lm studio for local llms works a bit different and while on win it didnt see option for endless generation now\n it only generates endlessly and prompt itself which is weird but fine.\n a1111 and comfyui works flawlessly.\n Installing aps with command line is in my opinion actually less of hassle than uncheking million of ad boxes in standard win installators\n My only complain is that pop shop is a bit laggy but cosmic shop is there and works much better.\n In all my 60 days of using pop_os i only once needed to use my windows laptop and it was to play league of legends. And not playing league is in general good for mental health.\n So yeah I'm still amazed how different my current experience with linux is compared to 2016 or even 2019\n    submitted by    /u/N3Rumie  \n [link]   [comments]",

Without this step, the phone will keep disconnecting. On windows, if you do not select \"Keep Originals\", it will auto convert HEIC to JPG when importing using File Explorer or Photos App.\n  \nMount your iphone via USB\n  \nThere are many ways to do this and I can't remember how I did it. I don't have ifuse installed. Pair your computer to the phone. You might have to try different ports, different cables. lsusb to see if it's connected.\n  \nInstall gthumb.\n  \nLog out, log back in. Gthumb is great because it will only import new photos on subsequent transfers.\n  \nPlug in your phone. On the phone, you will meet pop up boxes. \"Trust\" your computer and \"allow\" photo transfers.\n  \nThat's it. Hope this helps.\n ps. Why HEIC? It's smaller than JPG.

This is found under Settings > Accessibility > Color and motion > Color correction. \n \nExternal display settings - a feature I spotted last month - is now live in Android 15 QPR1 Beta 2! When you hook your Pixel 8 or Pixel 9 series device up to an external monitor, you'll be able to change its display resolution or rotation under Settings > Connected devices. \n \nGoogle has announced that Android 15 QPR1 Beta 2 enables desktop windowing support on tablets like the Pixel Tablet. \n \nAndroid 15 QPR1 Beta 2 enables the lock screen widgets feature on the Pixel Tablet. More details can be found in my article on Android Authority. \n \nAndroid 15 QPR1 Beta 2 now lets you customize the look of the mouse pointer, so you can make it easier to see.\n \n What's in development for later\n  \nThe notification cooldown feature that used to be in the Android 15 preview - the one that stops notification spam - might be coming back in Android 15 QPR1. Here's a first look at its updated page in Settings. \n \nGoodbye Extra Dim, hello Even Dimmer! In Android 15 QPR1 Beta 2, Google is preparing to integrate Android's Extra Dim feature into the system brightness bar, so you don't have to remember to turn it off in the morning anymore.\n \n    submitted by    /u/MishaalRahman  \n [link]   [comments]",

I had my phone rooted for a long time because I like more control over my phone. Google has been slowly eroding that and now I can't even use RCS anymore because my bootloader is unlocked. The only 2 things keeping me here are notifications and firefox.\n Anyways, to elaborate on the headline instead of ranting: Tensor is not great for anyone who wants to do anything with videos. It takes so long to cut the length of a video. And when I was blocking out the kid face it took so long to save that video.\n https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8T7w7mzNqI8 here is a video showing how long it took to shorten \n https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8T7w7mzNqI8 here is how long it took to save.\n It is just really frustrating as when I want to send videos to my family it takes so long to shorten the extraneous parts. iPhones and even qualcomm chips are sooo much faster and I don't know I can in good faith upgrade to a $1,000 phone when performance on an every day task is so terrible.\n    submitted by    /u/rustid  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hello everyone,\n I’ve spent the last two weeks testing my new Chipolo One Point tracker with Google’s new Find My Device feature. I placed the tracker in my car, which was parked in a long-term parking lot at the airport. I was eager to see how often the tracker would be detected. I reported the tracker as missing in Find My Device and waited for a notification that it had been located. Well, I waited the full two weeks, and the tracker was only detected when I was back at my car. \n It was only after this that I researched why the tracker hadn’t been detected even once. It turns out that in the Google settings, the owner of each individual phone must manually enable the option to find trackers and other Find My Device devices. By default, trackers are only found in highly frequented areas, where multiple devices detect the tracker simultaneously.\n The parking lot where my car was parked is visited by a relatively large number of people—most of the parking spaces were booked. Yet, my tracker was not detected even once.\n I wish I had placed an AirTag for comparison. I’m sure the AirTag would have been detected at least once, if not several times.\n I really thought the new Chipolo trackers would be a viable alternative to Apple AirTags.\n Unfortunately, Android trackers are useless to me in this regard.\n    submitted by    /u/Komplexkonjugiert  \n [link]   [comments]",

To me, it feels like faster phones are already offering diminishing returns compared to the speed boosts the latest processor used to give you. \n Am I missing something about faster processors these days?

Thats when I got introduced to this brand with the Redmi Note 9 Pro which I bought lightly used 2.5 years ago for 140$. I was shocked to see that what I did on my 1400$ iPhone actually felt easier on Android even on a cheap phone with low specs. There some huge gaps in terms of camera and snappiness of course but the experience was still a 7.5/10 which for the price difference blew my mind and in fact some features on Android were plain impossible on iOS (custom video players, access to useful open source apps etc.) My previous experience with Android was way back in the day were I bought a Samsung No…",

          "description": "https://www.v2ex.com/t/1073207\n帖子里说“原来阿里云盘在服务端是不加密的”然后一堆人附和，说加密就不能秒传。看来大家对加密的概念还很生疏。\n对阿里云不熟，就拿 aws 的 s3 来说吧。s3 默认对于每个文件都是服务端加密的，而且是每个文件一个密码。但即使是这样，也不影响设计秒传，不影响一个用户看到他人的文件。\n所谓 server 端加密，是指［文件不会明文写到磁盘上］。在上传时用随机密钥加密文件，随机密钥再用预先配置的非对称密钥加密，然后将随机密钥加密后的文件、非对称加密后的随机密钥分别存储在 aws 中。在下载时，aws 会先解析成明文，然后使用 https 传输到用户/业务服务器。所以无论谁去下载你的文件，aws 都会给他解密后的版本。\n至于秒传，是第一次上传时保存整体的哈希，以及每一个文件块的哈希，类似 bt 种子。再次上传时，用户本地生成一个新的哈希，服务端一看，在我的 redis 里面已经有这个种子了你就秒传了，跟文件存储一点关系都没有。\n如果你希望服务器不能看你的文件，那要做的是客户端加密，也就是文件已经加密好上传到服务器，服务器根本不知道如何解密当然也就没法生成缩略图或者秒传了。\n所谓服务端加密指的是静态加密，写盘时加密。再严格一点给你加个内网传输加密，也就是在内网的 http 和数据库连接什么的给用 tls 保护一下。数据在内存里可都是明文。",

          "description": "在前端使用加解密方式容易暴露密钥（或许一定会），但是如果把密钥藏起来，藏到二进制中或许就不容易被发现了。\n\nsm4-sdk\n是我用来验证想法的 demo ，下面介绍大概思路，以及有些踩坑的内容\n一、基本情况\n1 、使用 wasm-pack 这个工具来创建项目，编译成 web 类型\nwasm-pack new sm4-sdk\nwasm-pack build --target web\n\n2 、使用了一个简单的国密库\ncargo add smcrypto\n\n经过一番研究发现它的 Padding 模式是 PKCS5Padding\n3 、使用dotenv达成编译阶段注入变量的目的\n从前端的工程化的一些经验中借鉴来的，dotenv支持从环境变量和.env文件读取变量，\ncargo add dotenv\n\n// file config.rs\nuse dotenv_codegen::dotenv;\n\npub const KEY: &str = dotenv!(\"SM4_SDK_KEY\");\npub const IV: &str = dotenv!(\"SM4_SDK_IV\");\n\n4 、如何使用\n克隆这个项目，将.env.example修改为.env文件，修改里面的密钥内容，执行\nwasm-pack build --target web\n\n二、踩坑\n1 、安装wasm-pack\n安装wasm-pack命令有两种方式，通过cargo或者npm\n如果是 windows 环境，建议设置 default host 等设为msvc\n// file settings.toml\ndefault_host_triple = \"x86_64-pc-windows-msvc\"\ndefault_toolchain = \"stable-x86_64-pc-windows-msvc\"\n\n2 、使用github action自动打包\n希望通过github action的环境变量提供给项目打包时使用，可能dotenv没有支持好，可能是我配置不对。不过不折腾的方式是配置repository secrets，使用时新建一个.env文件\n// file workflows/wasm-pack.yml\n      - name: create env file\n        run: |\n          touch .env\n          echo SM4_SDK_KEY=${{ secrets.SM4_SDK_KEY }} >> .env\n          echo SM4_SDK_IV=${{ secrets.SM4_SDK_IV }} >> .env\n\n三、如何使用\n参考项目中的example.html的做法，这个项目并没有上传到 npm 上，\n<script type=\"module\">\n    import init, { encrypt_to_base64, decrypt_from_base64 } from './pkg/sm4_sdk.js';\n\n    const run = async () => {\n        await init();\n        const origin = \"hello world\";\n        const encoded_str = encrypt_to_base64(origin);\n        console.log(encoded_str); // ${encoded_str}\n        const decoded_str = decrypt_from_base64(encoded_str);\n        console.log(decoded_str === origin);\n        appendResult(encoded_str);\n    }\n\n    run(); // checkout console for result\n</script>",

          "description": "我理解的保险就是把所有参保人的保费放到一起，发给需要理赔的人。其中需要扣除所有中间环节的消耗、保险公司的利润等等。所以从概率上来讲，如果每个人理赔的概率均等，买保险一定是一个赔钱的不划算的行为。\n但是实际上有两种情况：\n理赔概率不均等，有的人就是面临某些危险的概率更高，能获取理赔的概率更高。\n理赔金额有可能超出了自己的支付能力。比如自己只有 20 万，一旦有重大疾病就完蛋了，如果买了 200 万的保险有机会以小博大。\n因此保险还是有一定意义的。\n但是反过来讲，如果是一个生活条件还不错，常见理赔金额自己都能掏的起，也不用面临什么危险的人，对他来说买保险是完全没意义的？",

          "description": "今天下午，一朋友在某群 at 我，神秘兮兮的说道要考我一个问题。题目是这样的：\n在 Java 中有 Father 和 Son 类，其中 Son 继承了 Father 类，两类均有 method 方法，现在 Main 类的 main 方法有如下调用：\nFather f = new Son();\nf.method();\n\n问题是，编译此代码，完成后删除 Son.class，请问代码会报错吗？\n我嗤之以鼻，这还用问吗？我甚至可以告诉你这个代码会报的错一定是 NoClassDefFoundError，这也太简单了你拿这个来考我 balabala...\n然而朋友鬼魅一笑（？），你别急啊，题还没出完呢：\n在上述代码的基础上，加入一个 flag justFalse，并环绕到上述代码中：\n// in Main.java\nstatic boolean justFalse = false;\n\n// in Main#main method\nif (justFalse) {\n\tFather f = new Son();\n\tf.method();\n}\n\n同样编译后删除 Son.class，请问代码还还会报错吗？\n我大笑（？）道，这还用问？justFalse 永远是 false，也就是说内部代码永远不可能执行到，那么 Son 类也就永远不可能进入初始化阶段，所以这个代码肯定就不会报错了，这也太简单了你拿这个来考我 balabala...\n然后朋友发来的一张图让我沉默了：\n\n竟然真的会报错，难道 JVM 虚拟机会提前解析并未执行的代码行中包含的类引用吗？不对啊，这和我以前的实践完全不一样，怎么会这样...... 就在我陷入自我怀疑的时候，下一题来了：\n在上述代码的基础上，如果把 Father f = new Son(); 修改为 Son f = new Son();，在同样的操作下，请问代码还还会报错吗？\n我小心翼翼地问道：不会这样它就不会报错了吧...\n朋友淡淡说道：正是。\n我的脑海中此时一万匹草泥马奔驰而过，各种名词在我的大脑中穿过：类加载、静态分派、运行时多态、分支预测... 但没有一个能解释这个诡异的现象。\n我的天塌了。 \n深入了解 JVM 类加载机制\n当说到 JVM 的类加载机制，很多人可能会脱口而出：加载、验证、准备、解析、初始化。如果你接着问他，他可能还会告诉你，解析这个阶段在某些情况下可以在初始化阶段之后开始，这被 JVM 虚拟机称为“惰性解析（\"lazy\" or \"late\" resolution ）”。那么，出现上述情况的原因可能是因为惰性解析被提前了吗？\n然而答案是否定的，在任何情况下，对于一个类，无论其静态分派的类型是什么，其解析都会延迟进行。（即使在 JVM specs 中这种行为是未定义的，虚拟机实现可以选择立刻解析或是延迟解析）\n那么问题出在哪里了呢？经过一番查证，我发现这个报错其实是在 JVM 类加载的验证阶段产生的。\n注意，这里说的不是验证 Son.class 或是 Father.class，而是 Main.class。如果你仔细观察上面给出的堆栈轨迹（在 Oracle JDK 1.8, Hotspot VM 下），其中有一段就是 sun.launcher.LauncherHelper.checkAndLoadMain(LauncherHelper.java:632)。\n在类加载阶段，JVM 虚拟机会试图校验一个类的某些部分是否是未被破坏以及符合预期的。在对 Main.class 类的加载过程中，对于 Father f = new Son(); 和 f.method();，产生了一个包含向上类型转换的多态函数调用，对于这种调用，JVM 虚拟机会试图进行校验，这就需要加载 Son.class 的类结构，而 Son.class 已经被我们删除了，所以产生了报错。\n这种检查需要同时包含 typecast 以及多态函数调用，在上述代码中，无论将变量类型修改为变量的实际类型 Son，亦或者删去对 method 方法的调用，那么也不会产生报错。\n最后，如何验证上述推断是正确的呢？很简单，使用 -noverify 参数关闭 JVM 的类加载校验，你就可以发现上述代码正常运行了。\n（上述代码在 Java 1.8 和 Java 21 的 Hotspot 虚拟机上均能复现。为方便行文，对部分内容有所改编。）",

          "description": "事情起因是这样的。前天的一个帖子里（ https://www.v2ex.com/t/1070885?p=1#reply35 ）大家都表示 AI 对自己的工作无用。我只是有点好奇，为什么我的感觉完全相反？所以想分享一下我的感觉和情况，很好奇大家感觉的没用是什么意义上的没有用（因为不了解专业程序员的工作流程）。\n本人没学过大多数码，但是算法懂。因为工作和研究兴趣需要（ NLP ，很多很冷门的语言），也会经常坐一些很没办法要做的东西。比如分词器，就和 Andrej Karpathy 的网课跟着做，所以其实前一段时间看见他推荐 cursor ，我前天开始也就试着用。然后就觉得 AI 太有用了。我暂时感觉突然摆脱了对程序员的大多数依赖。\n比如，试验阶段就很快用 prompts 做了一个全栈的、机构内部使用的工作记录论坛，感觉很兴奋。因为我之前既不会 java 、也没学过 sql 。就看着看着，debug 的时候，感觉就大概了解了构架、前端后端怎么互动的 blabla ，觉得很不错。我打算马上用现有的经验，写一个网页版的数据库，可以搜集结构化的语料 metadata （就是研究生会看古代语言的、就用这个网页进行标记并且生成结构化的元数据的 database 了，以后 training 时候用）（这样他们做习题就是 labelling slaves 了哈哈）。在之前这是想都不敢想的，肯定会想外包。但即便让专业 coder 做，也会有太多太多需要交流的小细节，比如很多语言是从右到左、从上到下，元音啊各种细节包不包括，乱七八糟的细节，这些调整交流起来会吐血（尤其是 coder 如果完全是技术部门来的），和 cursor 交流就感觉非常好，真的可以一个人把这个想了很久的事情做成。\n再举一个例子，我之前也想过用 OpenAI 的 api 去导出一些专业的语料元数据，但是有一定的格式需求。我大概知道 function calling 和新的 Response format 可以实现，但是因为自己不是专业的，手笨不会做。但程序员一般都只会英语或者欧洲语言，对这些元语料的结构理解需要很多解释（因为现代语言一般语法都很简单），这是去年就一直搁置到现在。昨天突然想起来，半个小时之内就开始用 function calling 自动帮我生成 training data 了。今天打算晚点试试 response format 效果会不会更好。\n所以我会感觉 ai 真厉害，尤其是很多事情可以一个人做了，会比团队快很多。可能有人觉得 AI 不会 debug ，其实不是这样的。第一，这几天 cursor+claudedev 几乎可以解决过程中 60%的错误。即便不能解决，很快要求它们解释哪部分代码是负责的，看懂之后很容易也能修好剩下的问题。（可能对程序员来说，没学过 java 看 java 的代码是荒谬的。但是实际情况是，其实 java 和 python 里也充满了自然语言，大多数问题理解了出在哪里就很容易看见并且修改。一些更高级的概念，比如类的继承啥的，单独看半个小时也基本理解了，虽然具体语句记不住但是可以问 ai 写。更复杂的 transformer 啥的框架确实要另外学懂才会改造，这个 ai 不行。还有， 剩下 40%的几率 ai 即便不能完全 debug 、但可以快速定位是哪些代码，定位速度可能比有经验的眼睛还快）\n是不是专业程序员写的程序都比这些任务要复杂很多，所以 ai 会失效？还是什么别的原因会觉得 ai 鸡肋呢？真心好奇，避争论。",

          "description": "本文作者没有一步登天，也没有怀揣 200 个 w ，更不会装 b ，请放心阅读。\n昨天躺在床上玩手机，突然一想，是不是已经来上海 8 年了？\n2017 年 7 月份的那个夜晚，我从苏州的泰南苑出发，当时的行李很简单，就一个书包和行李箱，坐着和谐号列车，深夜到的上海。\n这个箱子还是我刚上大学那会买的，很重，但很大，我有点担心它挡住过道上别人来来往往，就想把它抗到头顶的行李架上，但是试了好几次都失败了，太重了，每次抗到腰这个位置就被迫放下了。旁边坐着的人肯定都觉得我很奇怪吧，他也太自不量力了，是不是农村来的土狗？\n我不是第一次来上海，以前上大学时，每次都要来上海中转，一般都是晚上的车，所以下午我都会找个地方逛一下，一个人在这个城市里走一走。每次闲逛时，总会被上海的摩天大楼震撼到，这里的路怎么这么宽敞啊，这里的大楼怎么会这么高啊，马上就会有一种自卑感，有一种渺小的感觉。这种感觉留在我的心里很久很久，以至于工作后很久我都不敢来上海，觉得自己太菜了，不配来上海。\n真正让我动心来上海的是，有个同学在上海工作很轻松，都是做程序员，他朝九晚五的，不用加班，我每天还要加班到 9 点多，关键工资是我的两倍多，这让我瞬间有些不服气了，大家水平都差不多，凭什么待遇差这么多啊？\n刚来上海的时候，其实挺不顺利的，不仅是工作，还有生活。\n我记得第一次租房子就租到了群租房，是一个客厅改装成的小房间，当时心里还美滋滋，1500 ，在上海一个高档的小区租到了房子，还挺能耐。同时也是自己第一次在外面租房，感觉还挺自由，再也没有人管我了，想几点睡就几点睡，同时对于我这种 i 人，也不用跟别人社交了，回家就算在家里静静发呆也挺好。\n可是好景不长，一天早上，一阵急促的敲门声把我吵醒，打开门，一群叔叔带着一群农民工直接走进来。还没等我开口问叔叔什么事，那群拿着大锤子的工人直接把锤子抡向木板隔成的墙，大锤 80,80,80 ，那临时拼凑成的木板墙怎么会经受的住这种猛烈的撞击，三两下就都倒塌了，倒向了我的房间，我的床，我的房间就裸露在外了，他们砸完什么都没说，就走了，临走前还把电给断了。\n这个社会不会直接跟你说这个是对的，那个不能做，只是在你做了一件事情后，给你后果，不管是好的后果，还是坏的后果，推着你继续往前走。\n现在大家都说行情不太好，前几年是互联网的黄金时代，随便一个人，包装一下简历就能找到好几个 w 月薪的工作，看到很多短视频还在说，2018 年是最好的一年，值得怀念，可是对于我来说，2018 年真的没有想象中那么好，2018 年我工资就只有几 k,天天还各种加班，被老板 pua,怀疑是自己的问题，严重的拖了大家的后腿。\n有种说法是苦难才能成就今天的自己，我并不这么想，我觉得苦难就是人生的一道坎，不管你是积极面对，还是悲观面对，它都是在那里阻拦着你，如果有的选，没人愿意主动去吃苦。\n没有耀眼的学历，没有显赫的背景，在大城市里单打独斗，随着时间的流走，身上吃饭的技能总会比当初更加成熟，比当初的自己更厉害了，但是个人的成长永远都赶不上时代的潮流的。我已经忘记了当初选择来上海的豪言壮语，但我想肯定不是说为了找一份糊口的工作吧。\n一个资质平庸，能力平庸的人在深夜胡言乱语。",

          "description": "房子卖掉了，亏了小几万，可以接受，就当买个教训。\n以后都不敢把希望寄托在邻居的素质上了。当然还有新房的质量上了。\n把从买到卖，盘点一下，才发现一路走来，真的一步一坑。\n一 买房\n当时还是限购， 需要摇号。\n我家就一个人有资格，\n摇中后， 两个选择：\n1 付定金 2w 。  2 放弃购买，半年内无资格参与摇号\n当时只有样板间，也没什么好参考的，\n所以除非有特别原因 等同于只能选 1 。\n然后约付首付，又是两个选择\n1 付首付。2 放弃 损失定金。\n所以等同于还是只有一个选择。\n我印象里付完首付，才签的合同，记不太清了。\n当时宣传的是房子当年年底就可以交房，我们也是被这个吸引的。\n实际签合同时，在未有任何通知的情况下，合同上的交房时间比宣传的延期了 7 个月。\n这时候同样两个选择，1 签合同，2 扯皮，大概率亏钱。\n毕竟定金，首付都交了，贼船已经上了。\n所以实际上，等同于还是只有一个选择。\n然后交房时间比合同上的还要延期，实际晚了一年半。\n哦 对了 当时还新实行了一个政策，大意就是不卖毛坯了，卖精装修，合同上装修价格是每平米两千多。\n也是没法反对的。\n还能咋样呢，继续签字呗。\n二 收房\n当时花了两百多，请了个验房师。\n人家倒也算敬业，大大小小便利贴，贴了一屋子。\n什么空鼓，裂缝，锁装反了，比比皆是。\n最搞笑的是，燃气热水器孤零零的挂在那，居然接不到燃气管。\n然后呢 报备到开发商，\n偶尔才有下文。\n有些改了，大部分不了了之。\n同样，业主一点办法都没有。\n看似有选择，实则无选择。\n不收房，房子也是你的，问题也还是存在的，我有邻居三年没收房，里面的门还是没装的。\n只能先住着吧。\n三 住房\n三个字，质量差。\n今天这里坏，明天那里坏。\n电梯不到一年，就频繁的关人，或者维修。\n洗脸池，睡前还好好的，起床发现洗脸池掉地上了。\n有个业主很委屈的在群里说，“你们啥时候来给我修灯啊，我都摸黑半年了”。\n最大的槽点是隔音，极其的差。\n楼上，楼上的楼上，楼下的走路说话唱歌，我都可以听到。\n我的房子里就像恐怖片一样，明明就我一个人，能听到一大家子的声音，\n身临其境。\n有走路的，有放东西的，有大喊的，有跑步的，有关门的，\n此起彼伏，热闹非凡。\n偏偏我楼上素质极差，十岁大的小孩，三年学不会穿拖鞋，大人放任不管。大人七点吵架，摔东西。\n沟通过，讲道理过，吵架过，反击过，甚至想过同归于尽，\n不胜其烦。\n当时还是限售，想卖都卖不掉，我是生生的被折磨了几年。\n最后限售过了，很多原因叠加，决定卖了。\n四 卖房\n现在卖房的情况是，不管你装修，不管你户型，不管你楼层，不管你的任何附加价值，只看小区的近期成交价。\n这肯定是不合理的，\n因为就算你去买猪肉，还得分前腿和五花，不同部位的价格肯定不同。\n所以个人感觉这种情况不会持续太久。\n中介，很不专业，房屋信息都能讲错，只会不停的劝你降价。\n（我的房子挂的价格是很公道的，贝壳评分也很高，并没有挂高价）\n甚至出现过疑似虚假带看的行为。\n有一个很假的客户，他走后我就知道，第二天中介肯定要来报价，果然报价了。\n签约，合同是统一的模板，但感觉对卖方的保障不够到位，\n比如如果因为买家问题，导致贷款批不下来，最后终止合同，默认选项是定金返还。\n这就不合理，要不然要定金干嘛呢。\n如果有卖房的朋友，可以关注下这里。\n卖房流程还有一个坑点，首先每个地方的流程和政策是不一样的，可能我说的，其他地方是不存在的。\n买家拿到新房产证后，需要去抵押，然后银行放款。\n这里的坑点就是，如果买家不去抵押，选择了取消贷款，房子已经过户了，你尾款收不到。\n我不知道其他的地方是怎么保障这一块的。\n我去问过银行，他们说，买家是可以取消贷款的，银行不能阻止，也不会通知卖家。\n我也网上查过，有地方是发生过这种 zha 骗的。\n如果买家确实要买，那就没问题，如果别有用心，就很难说。\n所以我当时还是焦虑了两天，还好收到钱了。\n综上，这就是我从买到卖的经历。\n如果踩几个坑，那也许是我运气不好。\n如果每一步都踩了坑，我想不会全是因为我衰。\n反正经历了这一切，我是不太想买房子了，至少不买新房。\n唉 其实房子卖了，还是有点舍不得的，折磨了我这么久，但我也投入了这么多精力和感情。\n现在无车无房无债，有存款。\n希望开始新的生活。",

          "description": "一、汇丰旺角分行\n材料：\n1.身份类：身份证，通行证，过境小票\n2.地址证明，收入明细证明，个税 app\n流程：\n提前约到了 30 号下午 4：00 的号，15：47 才能刷二维码。刷码等叫号，查看身份证，通行证，过境小票，地址证明，收入明细，通过个税 app 查看工作单位。按步填写信息全拼音，签名用中文即可，电话号码用内地号码。询问带了多少现金，我说 1w 多，存了 1.1w ，给卡，提醒要当天内在 atm 改密，初始密码在白色回单上。接着我询问是否有 mastercard ，对方不明白，但后来帮我申请了扣款卡。再接着问能否申请信用卡，回答说信用卡对内地人已停办。后来回住处后，自己在网上申请了，不确定能否申请成功。\n二、中银香港牛头角分行(不建议预约这家分行)\n提前 7 天预约了 31 号 9：00 的号，没办法，预约时网页卡顿，最后只好选了这家分行。人流量不大，但 8：30 到，门口也有长者在排队了。虽然不记得在哪个地方看到说这家分行不能当场下卡，但想着既然预约到了，那就碰下运气吧！\n1.材料：和汇丰银行旺角分行准备的一样，但还要求有近三个月的理财账户持仓和收支明细，也就因为这个材料没有，线下开卡失败。即便我说我有 A 股几年前的交易，并给对方查看了。对方还说不能是截图。\n2.线上开户：\n(1)要求：肉身过港，手机过港。\n(2)材料：移民局小程序过境信息 pdf 文档，通行证，身份证。\n(3)人脸识别比较坑，8 秒钟，3 个动作。\n(4)拍证件不能过亮反光。\n(5)实体卡邮寄到家，平邮。\n(6)资料可用全简体中文。\n3.线上开户弊端：\n(1)转数快小额支付没问题。\n(2)中银快汇等其他投资交易类业务没法办理，相当于内地开了张 II 类卡的感觉。联系客服说，要再次到任意分行提交身份证件，提供账户，签字印鉴，才能使用全功能。(只能看哪天会不会再过港了)\n三、ZAbank\n1.虚拟卡，开户流程和中银香港差不多，同样肉身过港，手机过港。\n2.要求：除了身份证、通行证、移民局小程序过境信息 pdf 文件信息外，还要内地银行卡和内地手机号参与验证信息，并且这张银行卡预留的手机号码要和 ZAbank 开户手机号一致。\n3.5 个工作日反馈开卡结果。\nPS:移民局小程序建议不用 hotmail 接收。不管是 hkt 的网络，还是我用 csl 或者 ctmo 数据打开都有问题，页面卡顿，点不开邮件，借助 tw 的梯子打开了邮件，但下不了附件，那会真是着急。也许是我的 iphone13safari 问题吧。最后重新发到 qq 邮箱解决问题。手机上有 qq 邮箱 app ，但是 qq 邮箱代收 hotmail 好像也有问题，不及时或者被 hotmail 风控。\n最后，这次到香港，去了油麻地果栏(水果批发也不便宜啊)，ifc ，港大(最近学校活动周末也要预约，拖个行李箱转悠真的把自己累到了)，圆方(港大到圆方好近，就是中环内部换乘很远)。每次都是经西九龙高铁过港，但还是第一次去圆方，感觉比 ifc ，海港城，崇光铜锣湾，时代广场，太古广场都要好逛一些的感觉。当然每次去到香港都会去星光大道拍维港日景和夜景。话说近几年汇率高企，买买买也没有之前划算了，再加上各大品牌为了盈利也提高了在香港的销售价格，也没那么大优惠了。",

          "description": "事情是这样的，若干年前，那会儿我还是个刚满 18 岁的小孩，也拥有了人生第一台笔记本。\n当时的我对科技/程序这块非常感兴趣，也学着开始上外网，但是当时我囊中羞涩，于是特别喜欢开启网站内容（例如 Prime Video ）/电脑软件（例如 Vmware 或者 Funsion 或者 Adobe ，只是举个例子）的试用。在试用期结束之后往往就放着不管了。\n这也成了本次事件让我焦虑的核心。由于当时的我年纪不大，不懂什么“料卡”什么“一次性邮箱”这种概念，往往直接用自己的 QQ 邮箱/outlook/gmail 注册账户并开启试用。\n有些试用只需要绑定邮箱/验证手机号就可以使用，有些试用则需要绑定银行卡才行。当时，我手里有一张自己名下的跨境通 Visa 卡，于是就把自己的卡绑定上去了。\n由于我卡里长年不放钱（余额小于 1 美元），因此即使后续发生扣款，也是无法扣成功的。\n长大之后的我知道了不可以如此随便的开启试用（不能抱着白嫖的心态），但是感觉为时已晚，现在的我能做到的只能是把当时我开的那张跨境通 Visa 卡销户。\n因为目前我患有焦虑症，所以对自己十分敏感。我最近看到了 Adobe 的新闻，又让我感到十分内耗，害怕我未来因为之前白嫖试用的事情被清算。\n但是由于距离事发已经过去了三四年了，邮箱记录丢失，我的记忆也都十分模糊了，因此完全不记得我曾经开启过哪些试用。\n还有一点也很让我头疼，就是因为我记性不好，加上当时有多个邮箱。于是就经常会出现注册的时候用 Outlook 注册，过了一段时间登陆时候搞错用了 Google 登陆（相当于自动注册了一个新号）的乌龙。这导致往往同一个网站我可能有多个账号，或者有那种未完成注册（验证了邮箱，但是没输入信息）的账号。不知道大家会不会也有这样的经历？\n因此希望各位大佬能发表一下自己的看法，我的担心是不是有些太夸张了？\n后续如果真的有什么问题的话，对方会邮件通知我吗？",

          "description": "不管上面想法有多好，但具体的执行方式让我很是恼火。平常维护交通秩序的交警是不会批罚单的，他们中的大多数是不会带着批条子的机器的（大概是因为管控得比较严，大多数辅警正警应该是没有权力开罚单的）。于是呢，每次要查头盔都是运动式的执法，专挑繁华路段，傍晚时分，一出动就是十数人，黑压压地站在路口四周，随时准备拉起人墙截住车流。何况这些交警的态度也算不上多好（毕竟他们觉得查头盔这事很正当，很可能把违逆的人视作刁民），不时能看到有人想要绕过去，然后几个彪形大汉一个箭步冲上去，这边拽住胳膊，那边拉住车把，还有一人迅速拔掉钥匙：路人纷纷侧目，不由得想起了某些港片中的场景；之后我去采访了一下那个被拦下的人，他回答我说，实在怀疑交警的根本动机，长这么大，第一次有了被压迫的感觉。这个时候路上骑电动车的，不少是吃过饭和家人一起出来转悠的，都开得很慢，所以反而最容易被交警抓住。他们的抵触情绪也是最大的：我开得又不快，真就是自行车的车速，你非要我跟那些车速追得上摩托的人遵守一样的法规，干嘛呀？\n       我觉得问题出在一刀切上，应该严格区分电动摩托和电动自行车，对于能开到 40/50 码的电动摩托加大监管力度，同时给与一些权力，比如办电摩驾驶证就能与摩托车平权，可以上机动车道；对于电动自行车，严格限速，安装踏板，不可后座带人，然后别太强求头盔的事，说不定人家穿汉服呢？",

          "description": "背景\n女朋友是今年的应届生，普通本科 视觉传达设计专业，父母在北京这边做点小生意，我也在北京，所以她实习就在北京，工作也在这儿找。\n水平在我看来是挺不错的，不管是平时那些设计作业，还是最后的毕业设计，我看了都觉得眼前一亮，在她们专业成绩也一直是第一名。\n知道这个学历和专业实在算不上好，所以预期并不高，大厂只是投一下简历凑个热闹，主要还是在找小公司 10k 以下的设计类工作，没想到这种要求了，还这么难。\n主要经过\n3-5 月\n在一家在线教育公司的平面设计岗实习，公司比较大，也比较规范，虽然钱不多，她干得挺开心，领导们评价也不错。5 月底回校准备毕业展的时候，跟领导确认无法转正，没有坑位，很洒脱地就辞了，想着毕业之后再找。结果，这一找，就找到了现在。\n6 月至今\n6 月份的时候我没怎么问，她自己也想先玩几天，有一搭没一搭地投简历，自然是没什么结果。进入 7 月份，她就有点急了，本来投的还都是上家公司那种规模的（ 1000+），无果后开始投各种小公司，结果还是没回音。\n我们俩商量，不行了，得换策略。\n不局限于文化行业了，各种行业的，但凡是个设计岗，都投。\n大部分岗位动辄要求两三年工作经验，所以现在就不在乎薪资了，只要能入职，工资低无所谓，积攒点工作经验以后再跳。\n有效果，陆续开始收到面试了，大多都是 10-50 个人的公司，给的薪资也都是 5-6K 。陆陆续续参加了十几次面试，结果，竟然一个都没能找到。我给大家挑几个典型的说一下：\n几个典型\n新型书店：早 10 晚 7 、偶尔出差、双休、五险一金、7K\n这是最想去的一个，公司实际上是个 书店+咖啡店+会场服务 的模式。排除掉服务员厨师什么的，算上老板一共就不到十个人。\n第一轮面试的时候，跟面试官聊得很好，面试官都让准备好入职手续了，说问下老板意见，应该没有大问题，结果老板要求加一轮面试。\n老板的那场面试，女朋友说全程没捞着说话，老板从工作内容讲到国家经济发展形势，又讲到人生哲理和对年轻人的殷切嘱托，然后就结束了，可以走了。\n第一轮的面试官说，老板有些其他顾虑，但是她本人非常认可，所以她会帮忙再争取下。然后，就没信了。\n打印店：早 8 晚 8 、单休、五险、7K\n说是某某文化公司，实际上是个大一点的打印店，所以会接一点帮小公司做点宣传册的设计工作。在招聘软件上确认了上述条件后，去现场面试了。\n出来面试的是打印店老板，对上述谈好的条件都不清楚，从头开始谈。PUA 一番后说工资 6K ，女友表示接受之后他突然说，刚才看错了，以为是有两年经验，没想到是个刚毕业的，那 6K 就不行了，只能给 4K 。再次表示接受之后，又说，工作时间不固定，只要店里有顾客就不能下班，五险一金统统没有，说团队培养新人也要成本云云。\n能看出来，人家就是不想要，所以也没有再纠缠。\n传媒公司&电玩城：早 11 晚 10 、月休 4 天、五险、5K\n老板有个电玩城，还有个传媒公司。所以去了之后既要给电玩城设计优惠券宣传图，还要给传媒公司设计些海报。从这个工作时间也能看出来还得兼电玩城服务人员。\n去面试，一开始，老板和副总就架个手机在那儿拍我对象。自我介绍完了之后，一边调整手机一边让重新说一遍，拍完之后两个人就走了，剩个戴眼镜的男的面试。问了包含星座血型 MBTI 等各种信息，让我对象详细介绍了自己的家庭情况和人生经历，然后开始点评。对象一边哭一边跟我复述他那些油腻到让人不适的发言，我都能想象这个老男人是用什么样的眼神打量眼前的年轻女孩。\n我的感受\n不找了，找个屁，这些狗屎工作工资还没我的零头高。我知道这是社会中的大多数，我也不是想抱怨，我只是觉得，我实在没必要让我对象吃这样的苦。她在家爱干啥干啥，网上接单作图一个月也能赚两三千了。\n但是她接受不了。\n好歹也是个本科生，她想不通为什么找个本专业的工作这么难，也接受不了自己只能做这样的工作。我想劝劝她，可最后也只能长叹一声，咋办呢？各位老哥？",

          "description": "先介绍下背景，坐标欧洲，家宽是墙上 RJ45 网口直接 DHCP 获取公网静态 IPv4 ，无 IPv6 ，这个 IPv4 似乎是跟着 MAC 地址的，只要 MAC 地址不变，这个公网 IPv4 就不变。平时插着一个小米路由器来用。\n然后我有台旧的 ThinkPad ，运行 Win10 ，Windows Update 一直开着的，平时一直都会更新到最新版。很多年了一直 24 小时运行，当个服务器用，平时跑些东西，没跑 HTTP ，也有在路由器上映射一些端口方便公网直接访问，主要是 3389 和 SSH （ Windows 自带的 OpenSSH ），当然在公网上的端口不是 3389 和 22 ，不过现在这似乎并不重要，人家都是直接扫服务的。还有一些其它端口是做 Tailscale 的跳板，也就是把我的 Tailscale 其它一些设备的一些端口通过这台 ThinkPad 跳到公网上，方便在外面不需要通过 Tailscale 来直接访问我的 Tailscale 网络中的一些设备。直接用的是 Windows 的 portproxy 。\n很多年了一直很稳定，这 ThinkPad 从来没死过机，没出过问题，平时基本就在旁边吃灰。\n然后今年 6 月 24 日我回国休假，记得 6 月 25 日我还在国内试着连了下这 ThinkPad 的 3389 ，看看速度啊啥的，也没用来干啥事。然后 26 号以后就连不上了，Tailscale 也显示这台机子离线。当时我也没管，因为想着可能死机了或者网崩了啥的，无所谓了到时回去了再看看怎么回事。\n然后今天刚回到欧洲，诡异的事情来了！！！！！\n第一件事是先发现 WIFI 上不了网，手机能连上小米路由器 WIFI ，但是无网络，登后台页面说 DHCP 无响应。以为路由器出了什么幺蛾子，第一时间重启路由器嘛，还是不行。\n然后看了下 ThinkPad ，发现 ThinkPad 死机了，按大小写灯不亮，屏幕也不亮，先没管，想着先去弄好网络先，看看网络怎么回事\n插拔了几次网线/重启路由都提示 DHCP 无响应，于是试试直接把网线插电脑上，但是网线插我电脑上又能获取到 IP 能正常上网，第一反应是路由器 WAN 口的 MAC 地址被运营商封了？然后路由器 WAN 口改个 MAC 地址，马上能获取 DHCP 能上网了，但是没过几秒又断网了，然后 DHCP 又获取不到地址了，像是被秒封了（划重点！）。\n这时无意间看到 ThinkPad 连着的交换机灯在狂闪（ ThinkPad 通过一个千兆有线交换机连到小米路由 LAN 口，此时交换机上没有除了 ThinkPad 和小米路由之外的设备），这时还是死机状态，连的显示器不亮，按大小写键盘灯不亮，风扇也不转说明 CPU 不热），于是我长按电源键强行关机重启了下 ThinkPad 。一重启网马上就正常了，小米路由 DHCP 马上有响应，马上能上网，甚至路由 MAC 地址都没改，然后改回路由默认的 WAN 口 MAC 地址也能正常上网正常获取 IP 了，一切都恢复正常了。\n妈也，细思极恐，不知道是不是我的 ThinkPad 被黑了有人做肉鸡一直 DDoS 啥的然后导致一插网线就被运营商封？现在我也还原不了现场了，ThinkPad 重启后一切都正常了，不知道当时交换机灯狂闪在那闪什么，早知应该当时直接把路由器 WAN 口插电脑上然后开 Wireshark 抓个包。\n看了下 ThinkPad 的 Windows 日志，系统那一栏没有什么异常，到 6 月 26 号晚上 19 点之后就没有了，像是突然死机的那种。\n然后安全那一栏能看到很多登录失败的，像是 3389/SSH 被爆破\n\n以前也遇到过也没什么，我也没弱密码，单纯爆破应该发生不了这些事情\n对了，这台 ThinkPad 上还装有火绒，基本上只打开了文件监控和下载防护，火绒没杀到什么毒，今天也 Windows Update 了一波，那个恶意软件删除工具也没杀到东西。简单看了下进程啥的都没有异常。\n这一切事件太诡异了，首先之前这么久从来没出过问题，稳定得一逼，偏偏在我回国休假第二天出的问题（难道我被搞了？），然后死机就死机吧，这死机的时候交换机灯还狂闪还搞得上不了网，虽然我不知道是不是真的是 ThinkPad 发出什么有问题的包被运营商封，但是一强行关机重启马上就正常。而且当时确实路由器改 WAN 口 MAC 地址之后得了这么几秒，然后又一模一样的现象了，直到重启 ThinkPad ，真的太诡异了。\n害，有没有哥们支下招，有什么要检查的，最好能查查到底发生了什么",

          "description": "2024 ，0819-0825\n开发进度被严重阻碍，时也命也。\nShip-A-Ton 第二周\n这周投入这个 App 的时间很少，吃喝玩乐+直面天命占了不少时间，但是不管怎样，还是在推进。和上一周相比，这周的工作时间大幅减少，只完成了 22 个番茄钟，还不如上周的一半多。\n\n这周一开始花了一些时间在解决 TabView 和 NavigationStack 之间的问题上，本来是想尝试实现一个自定义的 TabBar ，最终放弃了这个尝试，因为根据上周的教训，不能花太多时间在 UI 上，先专注于功能的实现。\nStash 和 Nibble 的功能基本都完成了，Jar 目前只实现了两种类型，还剩几种存款类型没做。为了能够 ship ，或许应该先砍掉一些 Jar 的类型。\n愿望清单模块又更名了，一开始叫 Wishlist ，后来叫 Goals ，现在改成了 Desires 。\n想想还剩四周了，而还有很多功能，比如通知提醒、数据统计和小组件还都没有做，感觉有点来不及了。\n好消息是，这周接触了一个设计师，已经达成了合作，接下来的四个星期要超级超级肝了！\n第二个英文 Vlog\n这周几乎没有录什么素材，为了撑视频的时长，加入了目前 App 的阶段性演示视频。\n这次我没有自己录音，倒不是怕口音丢人，而是一方面是为了节省时间，另一方面是为了保证音频的音量统一并且没有背景杂音。我用的是剪映的 AI 朗读，先是克隆了我自己的声音，然后把文本通过克隆声音生成对应的朗读音频。这个声音克隆真是厉害，音色没得说，和我一模一样，但是缺点也很明显，就是没有语气的变化，整个停下来感觉非常沉闷。\nWeek 2 for Ship-A-Ton\n本周学习\n# How to use programmatic navigation in SwiftUI\n# Sharing @Observable objects through SwiftUI's environment\n# 在 SwiftData 模型中使用 Codable 和枚举的注意事项\n# ContentUnavailableView: Handling Empty States in SwiftUI\n直面天命\n先说一下进度，目前刚过第三回的苦海。\n周一早上起来，就知道瑞幸开卖周边了，于是立刻下单了外卖，成功抢到周边海报。\n\n目前打得最多的就是白衣秀士、疯虎，被虐了二十多次才过。至于大家都惧怕的虎先锋，我打了四次就过了，比较辛运。目前卡在了寅虎，还在不断精进中。\n这个游戏是我玩得第一个魂 like 游戏。我知道自己手残，之前玩过卧龙·苍天陨落，第一个 BOSS 都没打过去就删了，所以只狼和老头环一直没敢碰。这次黑神话能玩到现在，全靠我玩战神打下的一点基础。这个游戏就是磨练心性，越挫越勇，不断精进，提升自己。\n玩了四天，手柄左摇杆就漂移了，虽然还在保修内，但是客服说需要返场维修，需要 7 到 14 天才能寄回来。本来想着要不就忍忍，这段时间正好用来写代码。但是纠结了一天，一想到要一个多星期不能直面天命，就痛苦不已，最终还是下单了新的手柄，次日达，继续直面天命！",

          "description": "前几天，去朋友工作的小公司溜达，朋友写前端，他身后一哥们写后端，看起来不到三十岁。我闲着无聊，就坐在后端老哥旁边，看他写写代码，不一会儿我朋友前端问题修改完了，打包项目发给他部署到服务器测试一下。这时候我看着后端开始了操作，他们用的是 Caddy Web Server ，于是后端就开始改 Caddyfile 文件：\n:2333 {\n   root * /var/www\n   file_server\n}\n\n:2333 {\n   root * /usr/root/dist\n   file_server\n}\n\n他简单的把之前的复制了一下，改了root路径，就打算重启caddy了。我说：端口也要改吧？他说：先试试。于是重启caddy，发现报端口重复的错误，又再次编辑Caddyfile，把端口改了。那一瞬间我甚至怀疑他是不是第一次写代码了，我虽然没用过caddy，但一个端口配置两个网站，稍微想想也不可能有这种操作吧？\n这件事让我想起几年前隔壁公司的一个女程序员 A ，因为大家一起下楼吃饭，也都比较熟，有一次 A 找我说：JS 有几个地方的代码报错，能不能帮她看看怎么回事？我过去一看，好家伙！一个类里面这样写着：\nclass Store {\n    function getItem(key: string) {\n        // TODO\n    }\n}\n\n我说类里面写函数为什么要加 function 关键字？她说好像有这种语法吧，她试了不行还以为开发环境哪里出错了！\n再说到另一个男同事 B ，这个同事是纯前端，完全不懂一点后端。有一次，他想试试用Node.js怎么读写数据库实现用户登录，然而编辑器却总是提示错误，我偶然瞅了一眼他正在摸索着写的代码，发现他在 JS 文件里这样写着：\nimport sqlite3 from 'sqlite3';\n\nexport function login(req: Request) {\n    sqlite3.SELECT * FROM users\n}\n\n我震惊了！函数里面都不是JS语法，这都看不出来？\n为什么我要说这几个事情呢，因为他们的情况真的太反差了。通过以上几个事情，不管是谁，第一印象都会觉得这几个人水平很菜。但除了第一个后端，后两个我是知道的。女程序员 A 和男同事 B 工作经历大概都是五六年了。\n女程序员 A 在他们公司干了两年，做的项目大概一二十万代码，她每天提交代码，开发能力肯定是够的，后面跳槽去了其他公司，据说干得也很好。\n男同事 B 参与的项目八十多万行代码（ css + js/jsx/ts/tsx + json ）,他参与需求开发和性能优化，平时的工作任务也没出过什么问题。\n你说他们水平不够吧，他们靠自己的能力完全能够应付日常的开发工作。你说他们厉害吧，有时候写出来的代码我甚至都怀疑他们会不会编程。（上面的几个问题，他们不是大意而犯错，是真的不知道自己写错了）\n真是奇哉怪哉！",

GitHub\n该软件的代码已开源并托管在 Public GitHub Repo ，GitHub 账户绑定了我在香港的大学的教育邮箱\n2. 我的主力机\n港版 Nothing Phone (2)，安装的是 GitHub 上 release 版的 APP ，未主动安装过反诈 APP\n3. 我的备用机\n国行 Realme 12 Pro+，安装的是 Android Studio Debug 版的 APP ，未主动安装过反诈 APP\n4. 我爸的手机\n国行 Samsung S22 ，安装的是 GitHub 上 release 版的 APP ，曾经安装过反诈 APP ，但是据我爸说在安装我的软件前已经卸载反诈 APP\n5. 我的主用电话卡\n插在我的主力机上，但是卡是落于我爸名下，但是我不清楚是否依旧被标记使用人是我\n6. 我的备用电话卡\n插在我的备用机上，实名认证是我\n7. 微信\n我在微信视频号上发布了一个关于我这个软件的介绍视频，并转发到了朋友圈，我的微信账号绑定的是我的主用电话卡\n细节\n反诈电话只打给了我，打的是我的主用电话卡，没有打给我爸，上来正确直呼了我的名字以及我做的软件名字。电话时间大概是我这个 APP 安装在我两部手机上一周后，是安装在我爸手机上约 3 天后，是我发布微信视频约 5 天后。\n最开始接到的是 96110 ，跟对方说明这个不是诈骗软件后，对方表示了解，并让我以后多注意一些。在挂断 96110 之后，街道公安打电话来了，表示要上访到家现场检查我的软件，但是因为我在学校，对方表示要把我这个情况反馈给上级，现无进一步通知。\n疑问\n为什么公安只打电话给我，并问我是不是我安装了这个软件，而从未询问过我爸？\n反诈中心是怎么评判一个软件是否是诈骗软件的？\n我在之前也做过很多小软件，不过都没有在我爸的手机上安装，为什么那些公安没有来查？\n我已经尽可能详细的写出所有细节，希望各位帮我想想到底是哪里出了问题？我个人觉得是视频号（但是要是完整看过这个视频，都不至于会认为这是个诈骗软件，因为这个视频已经把我这个软件的所有功能都演示过了）。\n我担心的不是反诈中心误杀了我这个软件，而是他们是怎么监测到我这个刚开发的软件的，在上述环节中总有一个地方被监测到了，我担心的是这个，并希望把这个隐藏的「威胁」清除。\n如果这个帖子还泄露了什么个人信息，烦请管理员帮忙删了，学生一枚，真的已经害怕了😨",

          "description": "最近楼上天天半夜噪音，一个月没怎么睡好，长带状疱疹，神经痛痛得我半夜嗷嗷叫，脾气很大。随便写点，不客观，没科学依据，没统计规律，就说几个认识的朋友。最好别封我，不然不知道去哪发疯。我也不是和他们一个圈子的，只是最近因为某些事情联系上了，发现我认为的精英们，竟然在苦恼这些，好吧我曾经也苦恼过现在淡定了。\n他们都是名校毕业，学理科，传统制造业和计算机行业。也都是价值观非常正派，求真务实，不坑蒙拐骗别人钱财和感情，不乱包装销售自己的人，于是也让自己非常非常的孤独，因为永远觉得自己不够好，永远没有准备好。\n不太幸福，也不快乐，永远焦虑，永远自我怀疑，钱多也焦虑，没钱也焦虑，优秀也焦虑，不优秀更焦虑。那种以为自己赚钱了就不焦虑的状态并达不到，为什么得到钱之后，还是焦虑。\n为什么亚洲人永远要活在成功学里面。中国理工科人，特别是男生，大概是当今全世界精神压力最高的群体，没有之一了。\n同学 1:\n父母清华的，家世太好，考试几乎门门都是满分，连语文都是只扣 2 分，扣的是作文，其他语文题都是满分。\n念书之后，那是念遍世界名校，最后也说卷的太累。以为人生就是一道又一道题，做好就行，最后发现，人生好像，不是做题欸。倒是父母给花的学费钱，要努力还给父母。不然自己以后换职业，都需要照顾父母面子。父母朋友都是那样，大学教授，单位中层干部，谁家的小孩，不是父母的面子呢，各家小孩，从小学就开始比，告诉我她从小就在的高要求下长大，不仅需要成绩好，连道德水平，待人接物，那是啥都要标准模板必须做到。进入社会才发现，原来事事可以做到 60 分，自己曾经努力的 100 分，是一种过度用力。为此感叹过去很多年，没有什么同龄人的生活，没有童年，青年欸。现在节奏慢下来，告诉我，哇，原来这才是人生啊。呜呜呜，原来可以这样简单做到啊。原来做到 60 分不是耻辱啊。\n同学 2：\n父母好像是保健品公司的小干部，父母爱卷的不行，他从小在家就和自己父母竞争上了。家里从来没有任何娱乐，父母不是在家学习工作，就是在外面参加行业活动，周末也不例外。这同学可能还是数学太好，从小竞赛金牌，一路保送至顶尖名校，现在熬出头了竟然告诉我说，看见代码心里就有阴影了。 一个多年搞竞赛，秒杀国内外竞赛的人，竟然看着自己最熟悉又擅长的东西，感到恐惧。同时因为自己形象太高大，出名之后，又太多学弟学妹的膜拜，自己反而不能做真实的自己了。在一个海边城市住，但是从来没去过海边，说永远有弄不完的项目，还是那句话，说自己没有生活。\n同学 3：\n父亲是公务员，同学本身成绩还可以，但是和前两个同学比，就算成绩普通的一般人。父亲一直让他考公务员，哇塞考 5 年了，考不上，同学都要精神崩溃了，给他讲了一下现在考的人太多了，胜算几率太小了，没事的不要逼迫自己。但是他真不行，在父亲面前，真是不敢说话。我真担心他就像新闻里面的那些考 n 年没上的人一样，精神崩溃了。\n总结：\n他们本身都很优秀，但是父母的确是时代红利，太过闪亮，他们别说超越父母，就和父母平起平坐都很困难。再加上自己说的，从小不知道什么是生活，彷佛，自己只要在一次又一次竞争中，得到胜利，就可以得到那个遥远的幸福。却说，当得到一切之后，自己已经失去了感知快乐的能力，只是把它当作一个任务完成了而已。\n还有，他们的父母好像都不允许他们，袒露自己的情感，不管是快乐的情感，还是悲伤，愤怒的情感，情感这块好像一直是一种压抑，未发育的状态。既无法表达自己的情感，可能是所处环境总是拒绝他们的情感需求，表达悲伤没有被安抚过，反而被父母说无用。所以早就关闭了这个情感通道，长大之后，也很难和其他人，建立深度的情感链接，不管是友情，还是亲密异性关系。哎~~父母太成功的小孩，真的有自我发展自己，生长成为一个自然形态的人的空间吗？不知道他们何时才能放下。幸福和快乐其实可以很简单。\n生活能把握住 60 分已经很不错了。不容易啊不容易。。",

          "description": "站长如何选择博客平台?在选择博客平台时，需要综合考虑多个因素，包括平台的易用性、功能、自定义能力、社区支持、成本以及是否满足个人或企业的特定需求 http://m.bokequ.com/list/22-0.html\n　　以下是一些建议，帮助您选择适合的博客平台：\n　　 1. 评估平台类型\n　　综合性平台\n　　优点：用户基数大，易于上手，提供丰富的模板和插件，SEO 优化较好，有助于内容推广。\n　　代表平台：新浪博客、博客园等。这些平台适合博客新手或偶尔写作的人。\n　　开源博客系统\n　　优点：提供高度的自定义能力，可以根据个人喜好设计博客的外观和功能，支持多平台同步发布。\n　　代表平台：WordPress 、Typecho 等。这些系统适合有一定写作经验和追求个性化的博主。\n　　专业内容平台\n　　优点：提供更高的流量和关注度，有助于内容的传播，同时提供丰富的商业合作机会。\n　　代表平台：知乎专栏、简书等。这些平台适合专业写手或自媒体人。\n　　 2. 考虑关键功能\n　　自定义能力：选择能够完全控制博客外观和功能的平台，如 WordPress 。\n　　 SEO 优化：确保平台具备良好的 SEO 性能，以便提高博客的可见性和访问量。\n　　社区支持：选择拥有活跃社区的平台，有助于内容分享和互动。\n　　插件和主题：查看平台是否提供丰富的插件和主题，以满足不同的功能需求和设计风格。\n　　 3. 成本考量\n　　免费与付费：许多平台提供免费和付费两种选项。免费选项通常有限制(如广告、存储限制等)，而付费选项则提供更多功能和更好的用户体验。\n　　长期成本：如果计划长期运营博客，需要考虑平台的升级费用、域名和服务器费用等长期成本。\n　　 4. 用户体验\n　　易用性：选择界面友好、易于操作的平台，以便快速上手和高效管理博客。\n　　编辑器功能：特别是对于喜欢使用 Markdown 等轻量级标记语言的用户，需要选择支持 Markdown 的编辑器。\n　　 5. 特定需求\n　　内容类型：如果主要发布图片、视频等多媒体内容，需要选择支持这些媒体类型的平台。\n　　国际化需求：如果博客面向全球受众，需要选择支持多语言和多地区的平台。\n　　 6. 示例对比\n　　以 WordPress 为例，它提供了广泛的自定义选项、强大的插件生态系统和 SEO 友好性，但需要一定的技术知识和资源投入。而知乎专栏则是一个适合专业和深度内容创作者的平台，拥有广泛的受众和友好的用户界面。\n　　总结：选择博客平台时，请根据您的个人或企业需求、技术水平、成本预算以及长期规划进行综合考虑。通过比较不同平台的优缺点，选择最适合您的博客平台。同时，记得定期评估和调整您的博客平台策略，以适应不断变化的网络环境和市场需求。",

          "description": "在 React 世界里，useEffect 和 useState 无疑是最常见的钩子（ Hooks ），它们让函数组件拥有了类组件的力量。useState 赋予了组件维护状态的能力，而 useEffect 则让副作用管理变得简单。\n对许多开发者来说，上述两个 Hooks 是 React 钩子的入门级应用，但随着项目复杂度的提升，仅仅使用这两个钩子可能会让组件变得臃肿，逻辑复杂难以维护。此时，众多开源社区的 React Hooks 库应运而生，它们提供了许多高质量、语义化的 Hooks ，帮助开发者更好地管理组件状态、副作用等，提升代码质量。@shined/react-use 就是这样一款优秀的 React Hooks 库。\n本文旨在充分利用 @shined/react-use 提供的 Hooks ，呈现一份全面的基于 React Hooks 的代码质量提升指南，引导你走出 useEffect 和 useState 的舒适区，发掘 React Hooks 的真正潜力和灵活性，提升项目代码质量。\n替换 useState\nuseState 是 React 中用来管理组件状态的 Hook ，基本上每个 React 开发者都会用到。\n但是低版本 React 中的 useState 可能导致非预期的行为。比如在 React <= 17 时，当组件卸载后，调用 setState 会抛出令人困惑的警告（参考 安全状态）。此外，React 内部使用浅比较来判断状态是否改变，这可能会导致组件进行不必要的重渲染，从而影响性能。\nuseSafeState\nuseSafeState 被设计为 useState 的直接替代方案，用于规避低版本 React 下的警告问题，并遵循官方做法在高版本 React 下与 useState 行为保持一致。\n同时它还具备可选的性能优化特性（deep 选项，深度比较状…",

A request that arrives sooner than 100ms after the previous one is put in a queue, and here we are setting the queue size to 20.\n\nThat means if 21 requests arrive from a given IP address simultaneously, NGINX forwards the first one to the upstream server group immediately and puts the remaining 20 in the queue. It then forwards a queued request every 100ms, and returns 503 to the client only if an incoming request makes the number of queued requests go over 20.\n\n结合代码和这段文字，我对 burst 的理解是：\n6r/m：以每 1 分钟为一个时间阶段，将这 1 分钟分为 6 段，即每 10s 最多接收 1 个请求，该 10s 内的多余请求将会被返回 503 ；\nburst=5：突发队列长度=5 。以每 1 分钟为一个时间阶段，在这 1 分钟内，该队列最多只能接受 5 个请求，即使该队列内的请求已经被处理，也不会往队列里新增新的请求，直到下 1 分钟到来。\n测试\n测试工具：jmeter \n\n预期结果：\n在 120s 内，一共发起了 120 个请求，其中请求成功 22 个(6+6+5+5)，其余返回 503 ；\n实际测试结果：\n在 120s 内，一共发起了 120 个请求，其中请求成功 17 个(6+6+5)，其余返回 503 ；\n为什么少了 5 个请求，希望大佬们为我指点下，谢谢~",

          "description": "起因\n自七月开始，手机开始陆续收到一些短信、贷款的推销短信。\n到了八月初，首先是接到了一个电话，声称我有一笔 “医疗补充金” 待领取。这种话术一听就是推销 or 诈骗，直接就挂断掉了。这个时候也没有特别关心，只是觉得推销越来越多了。\n之后的节奏就开始疯狂起来了，他们使用不同的短信签名发送内容大致相同但推广链接不同的短信。一会是信用飞、好分期、众安金融这些短信，一会又是通过不同的手机号码（非固定电话，全部是个人号码，但都是虚拟运营商）进行骚扰。以近乎每日一条甚至两三条的频率疯狂推送短信，电话则是每周能接到两到三次。\n我的号码会在工作中使用，短信尚且可以编辑规则屏蔽，但电话无能为力。来电的号码归属地哪里都有，除了都是虚拟运营商外，没有其他规律。\n端倪\n虽然短信签名不同，但他们使用的短链接大多相似。比如他们使用的一部分域名：\nkg1.cn\ngh1.cn\nqw7.cn\n8rf.cn\n这些域名都在近期内完成了 ICP 备案，并且来自不同的主体，大概是收购来的备案或域名。\n而贷款短信中的链接点进去会直接跳转到正规的小贷平台，跳转携带了 aff 链接。这些小贷平台会结算佣金，但不知道这条代理链条有多长，也拿不到相关的资料。\n无独有偶，在“医疗补充金”的骚扰电话来电后，也会收到一条签名为 “保单在线” 的企业所发的短信，使用的链接同样是与上述短信相同的 xxx.cn 格式。这个所谓的 “医疗补充金” 和 “保单在线” 其实已经被许多组织预警，可以查询到很多关于他们的信息。你点进他们的链接订阅了他们的产品后，他们会划走高额的订阅费用，大概率是针对不会操作取消订阅的群体。\n如图：\n滥发 106 短信，电话语音诱导诈骗别人订阅产品，听起来比较老的手段，今天仍然还在。\n最后\n其实在今天，骚扰短信和电话早就算是一件小事。我们的数据、信息早已被链条上的既得利益者传的满天飞。但见到这种程度的骚扰，终究还是令我比较担忧。\n我们作为每天耳濡目染这些圈套的人，也只能堪堪应对。很难想他们通过这些手段欺骗了多少不懂退订的中老年人。可能像是我的父母一样，上了年纪也不会操作，只能吃了哑巴亏。\n即便最后发现并通过种种方式退订，早就不知道被划走了多少隐性费用，但又够不上报警的条件。这种事情更不会告诉在外工作的子女，就这样被骗走少则几十多则几百上千的费用。\n个人的力量终归太有限，我很希望能深挖这条灰色链条，但又苦于没有时间、精力，也没有足够的手段制裁。能做到这些多多少少依赖着灰产。很多材料还能深挖出一些蛛丝马迹。但真的，个人的力量太弱小了。\n很无奈，但我能做的也只是把他发出来。",

          "description": "如果一个人没上班或者处在下班后的时间，你跟他说，猪肉一块钱十斤，他肯定会觉得要么你疯了要么商家疯了，因为他的理智告诉他，几乎不可能有这么卖猪肉的。\n但是，一旦类似的情况发生在公司，情况完全就变了。\n我们以熟悉的互联网公司为例。比如面试，我们都知道技术注重的是实操，但是很多公司就是喜欢面八股文，不注重实操。再比如加班，明明没什么事做，早点下班休息，第二天精神饱满才能更好干活，但是公司就是不让走，哪怕坐着玩手机都行。\n这些事情，在任何有理智的个人看来，都是很无语的行为，但是公司就要这么做。为什么呢？\n如果我们把视角拉高一点，从整个社会的视角看，把公司当作劳改所，把员工当作犯人。这样一来所有的事情就变得合理了，员工进来就是有罪的，而公司的义务就是把“犯人”好好改造。\n公司说猪肉一块钱十斤，你说不对，那就“打”，“打”到你同意为止。（“打”表现为降薪、扣绩效、辞退）\n公司说你活着全靠老板赏你饭吃，你反驳说你凭自己的能力挣钱吃饭，还是“打”，必须得把你这种“病态”的价值观“矫正”过来。\n当你活干得好的时候，就给你改善下“伙食”（加薪、奖金），当你没干好的时候，迎接你的就是“打骂”。\n所以，我不禁想到：在公司这座“劳改所”里，与其说员工是在赚钱，不如说是在接受劳改。改造的不能有自己的理性思考，改造的要默默为资本家服务。\n所以公司，不是单纯的经济实体，而是资本控制人们思想的统治工具。\nPS：只是随便聊聊一些看法，有不同意见欢迎评论理性探讨。",

          "description": "魔兽世界国服回归后，新版本《地心之战》即将登场，网易推增值服务“网易DD”提供带打服务，疑似官方下场参与RMT（Real Money Trading，即现实货币交易）事件，在玩家社区中引起了广泛的关注和讨论。\n\r\n\r\n事件概述\n\r\n\r\n网易有爱是网易官方推出的一个魔兽世界插件整合包，类似魔兽世界大脚插件或CurseForge，在国服重开之后，“网易有爱”更名为“网易DD”，并且重做了客户端，加入了更多的板块，8月22日，网易DD首页推出了一项增值服务，是以抢卷的方式为玩家提供H菲莱克地带打服务，原来30元的价格，降到0.01元，相当于用一分钱就让玩家体验其他工作室带打服务。另外，客服会强调这是官方团队，并且把这次的H菲莱克形容为“公益团”的带打行为。\n\r\n\r\n对此，玩家对此反应强烈，认为官方下场RMT破坏了游戏的平衡性和公平性，直接触及了游戏公平性和玩家体验的底线，使得游戏环境变得更加恶劣。同时，这也引发了玩家对网易运营能力和游戏未来的担忧。\n\r\n\r\n官方回应\n\r\n\r\n8月22日，网易运营团队在国服《魔兽世界》官网发布公告表示，此前引发大量玩家讨论的网易 DD“找人带带”活动已经下线。公告原文如下：\n\r\n\r\n\r\n亲爱的玩家：\n\r\n\r\n今日，网易《魔兽世界》官方运营团队收到玩家社区反馈，网易互联网新产品“网易DD”上线了暑期活动“找人带带”，并引发大量玩家讨论。我们第一时间与网易 DD 的同事们展开沟通，经协商，目前该活动已经下线。\n\r\n\r\n网易DD是网易集团旗下独立运营的工具软件，目前处于内测阶段，其运营行为具备自主性。在本次活动开展前，集团内部缺少及时的同步沟通，因此对社区造成了困扰，我们深感抱歉。\n\r\n\r\n未来我们将强化对各类工具软件的合作沟通机制及监督流程，始终把游戏的长期健康发展和服务广大玩家需求作为唯一目标，杜绝再次出现此类导致游戏社区困扰的活动。\n\r\n\r\n\r\n对游戏生态的影响\n\r\n\r\n根据国服暴雪战网最终用户许可协议1.C.iii.条款，战网用户同意不利用平台或游戏作为任何未被本协议授权的商业用途，包括以代练、租借通行证或游戏账号等形式进行游戏相关的服务以换取酬劳。\n\r\n\r\nRMT行为在网络游戏中有着复杂且深远的影响，以下是一些主要的方面：\n\r\n\r\n游戏公平性受损：RMT行为的存在使得玩家可以通过现实货币直接购买游戏内的优势资源或服务，从而破坏了游戏的公平竞争原则。\n\r\n\r\n玩家体验下降：对于坚持通过自身努力提升游戏水平的玩家来说，RMT行为无疑是一种打击。他们可能会因为无法与RMB玩家竞争而感到沮丧和失望。这可能导致非付费玩家失去游戏兴趣，影响游戏的用户基数和社区健康。\n\r\n\r\n破坏经济系统：RMT行为会破坏游戏内的经济平衡，一些玩家通过购买强力装备或虚拟货币获取优势，而不需要花费相应的时间和精力。这会导致游戏内的竞争失衡，可能让那些靠努力获取资源的玩家感到不公。\n\r\n\r\n深层原因\n\r\n\r\n虽然RMT行为在某些方面可能为工作室公司带来短期经济收益，但从长远看，游戏工作室对一款网络游戏的生命具有极大的破坏力，工作室会破坏游戏的平衡性和公平性，导致玩家流失，会大大缩减游戏的寿命，影响游戏的整体健康发展。游戏的开发商和运营商通常会采取有效的措施来限制工作室的活动，以确保游戏的可持续发展。\n\r\n\r\n既然如此，为什么网易为什么还要官方下场参与RMT行为呢？这和目前的市场环境有很大关系。\n\r\n\r\n目前的经济政策在一定程度上影响了企业的行为模式，导致一些企业倾向于追求短期利益，喜欢赚快钱，不肯投太多钱搞研发，喜欢偷别人的技术。\n\r\n\r\n经济政策朝令夕改，具有极大的不确定性，这种不确定性使得企业难以进行长期规划，因为未来的政策可能会突然改变市场环境，导致企业前期投资大量损失，为了应对这种不确定性，企业可能更倾向于短期快速获利，赚快钱，而不是进行长期投资，忽视了长期的品牌建设和可持续发展。\n\r\n\r\n网易做为一家庞大的游戏企业，也喜欢赚快钱。由于长时间的政策性风险，能够存活下来的网易，在结构性上就只有运营赚快钱游戏的经验，给它一个需要长期运营的游戏，它根本就不知道怎么才能有效运营，它从根本上还是打算执行运营一个只能存活1、2年的游戏的策略，只倾向于追求短期利益，而从不考虑长远发展，这就是网易为什么要做出这种让玩家匪夷所思行为的深层原因。\n\r\n\r\n结语\n\r\n\r\n综上所述，网易《魔兽世界》疑似官方下场RMT事件对游戏生态和玩家体验造成了严重影响，网易应该及时悬崖勒马，亡羊补牢，采取积极措施来应对此事件，确保游戏环境的公平性和健康性，同时也应加强与玩家之间的沟通和交流，共同推动游戏的持续健康发展。",
