          "description": "The edge of a sheet of paper slices through the tip of your finger and blood begins to flow from the wound. This injury, as small as it may be, must be repaired. Blood cells rush to the site, clotting, scabbing, healing. You never asked for it, but a few days later your finger is as good as new.\nIt has been said that humans are passengers on Spaceship Earth. This view is too simple. Earth is not a vehicle but a body — the body of a planet-sized being that is developing senses, an intelligence, a will, and even the ability to reproduce. We are cells building this body and maintaining it.\nFor hundreds of millions of years, Earth was a ball of warm rock covered in a thin layer of living things. But Earth itself was not yet alive, not yet aware. It was a body without a mind. Our industrious sp…",

However, the files you create in Obsidian are yours, and can hopefully last for generations. VCware is built with a five year horizon, it is not built to live on for decades.\nMany startup founders raise VC money because they need the upfront capital to build their product, or they see it as a shortcut to growth.

          "description": "Hello Hacker News! My name is Anonyo, and I am a seventeen-year-old from Southeast Michigan. This is wallstreetlocal, my passion project for the last year (and a half). I've posted this before, but I've finally open-sourced this entire project, so I thought I'd post it again.\nHeres the short pitch.\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) keeps record of every company in the United States. Companies whose holdings surpass $100 million though, are required to file a special type of form: the 13F form. This form, filed quarterly, discloses the filer's holdings, providing transparency into their investment activities and allowing the public and other market participants to monitor them.\nThe problem though, is that these holdings are often cumbersome to access, and valuable analysis is often hidden behind a paywall. Through wallstreetlocal, the SEC's 13F filers become more accessible and open.\nBy exploring the website (and the code), you can see the resources I used, check out some notable money managers I listed, and download any data that suits you. All for free. (Note, the mobile site likely needs work.)\nI made this project to better democratize SEC filings, and also to get some experience on my hands. I love computers, and one day hope to get involved with startups. In the comments, I'd appreciate any and all advice, as well as feedback on how to improve the site.\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39643833\nPoints: 144\n# Comments: 24",

It's an alternative to tools like Celery for Python and BullMQ for Node.js, primarily focused on reliability and observability. It uses Postgres for the underlying queue.\nWhy build another managed queue? We wanted to build something with the benefits of full transactional enqueueing - particularly for dependent, DAG-style execution - and felt strongly that Postgres solves for 99.9% of queueing use-cases better than most alternatives (Celery uses Redis or RabbitMQ as a broker, BullMQ uses Redis). Since the introduction of SKIP LOCKED and the milestones of recent PG releases (like active-active replication), it's becoming more feasible to horizontally scale Postgres…",

Here's a demo: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u0wAegt79EA\nInterest in designing new chips is growing, thanks to demand from AI and the predicted decline of Moore’s Law. All these chips need to be tested in simulation. Since the number of possible states grows exponentially with chip complexity, the need for verification is exploding. Chip developers already spend 70% of their time on testing. (See this video on the “verification gap”: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtaaOdGuMCc).\nTooling hasn’t kept up.

          "description": "Hi HN! I’m Gabriel, and I’m happy to share a project I’ve been working on for the last few years: Flyde, an open-source visual programming language. Check out the interactive examples and online playground on the website: https://www.flyde.dev.\nIn my last role as an engineering manager for a B2B-oriented product, I authored and reviewed many diagrams for backend applications, mostly for integrations between 2 third-party services. Some of these diagrams were elaborate enough that I started dreaming of a way to simply run a diagram as is; I imagined a “run” button on the top-right corner of the screen that would execute the diagram without the need to translate it into code.\nThat led me down a rabbit hole of exploration and experimentation, from tools like Zapier, Pipedream and Make, which are great for automating “backoffice” stuff, and up to NodeRED, NoFlo.js and the great work of J. Paul Morisson on Flow-Based Programming. I failed to find a tool that would answer my needs - a tool that balances a new level of abstraction, manages to stay powerful and flexible, and most importantly, integrates with the existing ecosystem, and doesn’t replace it. I built Flyde as an attempt to answer that need.\nFlyde is designed to complement and enhance traditional textual coding, not to replace it. It includes a VSCode extension, it seamlessly integrates with existing TypeScript/JavaScript code and can run on Node.js and in the browser.\nI believe that as we delegate more coding tasks to AI, we’ll assume the role of an architect rather than a programmer. This shift will require tools that focus more on orchestration and high-level troubleshooting and less on low-level functionality.\nI’d love to hear your thoughts and feedback on Flyde’s direction!\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39628285\nPoints: 185\n# Comments: 83",

          "description": "Hi HN! Erik here from Banana (formerly the serverless GPU platform), excited to show you what we’ve been working on next:\nFructose\nFructose is a python package to call LLMs as strongly typed functions. It uses function type signatures to guide the generation and guarantee a correctly typed output, in whatever basic/complex python datatype requested.\nBy guaranteeing output structure, we believe this will enable more complex applications to be built, interweaving code with LLMs with code. For now, we’ve shipped Fructose as a client-only library simply calling gpt-4 (by default) with json mode, pretty simple and not unlike other packages such as marvin and instructor, but we’re also working on our own lightweight formatting model that we’ll host and/or distribute to the client, to help reduce token burn and increase accuracy.\nWe figure, no time like the present to show y’all what we’re working on! Questions, compliments, and roasts welcomed.\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39619053\nPoints: 108\n# Comments: 62",

          "description": "Hi, I'm Will. I'm 24, autistic, and have OCD tendencies. I'm learning to code and this is my first public project. I’d really appreciate your feedback and encouragement!\nThis project lets me solve some of my OCD problems online. There are a couple of parts of the forums that I visit – Space Battles, Sufficient Velocity, and Questionable Questing – that I want to remove. Specifically, I hate seeing indicators of how much is left in a forum thread, because I keep thinking about how much content is left. It stops me from immersing myself in the story. It stressed me out. Before I learned to code, I'd use my hand to block the total chapter count so I could read the blurb and see the word count. I would do my best to ignore the page navigation bar except for the next page button, but I usually ended up failing. One of the reasons I always read in full-screen Safari is that I didn't have to see the tab name that always had the page number. I learned not to hover my cursor over the window because it would tell me the page number.\nThis project is a series of userscripts that hide those indicators. I coded the userscripts in JavaScript, and I used https://github.com/quoid/userscripts as the system. Despite the fact I didn't know what a userscript was until I started coding them, AI assistance allowed me to code them with minimal help from my brother, Stevie. Khanmigo helped me plan, write, and debug code. ChatGPT taught me the theory. Part of the reason I coded a lot faster with the later userscripts is I knew enough to realize when AI was talking about something irrelevant and redirect it. One cool moment was when I correctly predicted I didn't need to code different userscripts for SpaceBattles and Sufficient Velocity because Sufficient Velocity used to be part of SpaceBattles.\nI find it relaxing not to have to worry about accidentally seeing the chapter count or the final page number. Maybe they’ll help one of you!\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39618062\nPoints: 55\n# Comments: 17",

          "description": "Hi HN, we're the co-founders of Greptile, a tool that can accurately answer questions about complex codebases. Developers use us to spend less time wrestling with codebases and more time actually writing code. Here's a demo: https://youtu.be/qI24eKO1YX0. You can try it on 100 popular repos here: https://app.greptile.com/repo, and on your own repo (if you give permission - more on that below) here: https://app.greptile.com.\nWe are far from the first people to try \"RAG on your codebase\". We focus on full codebase comprehension: using LLMs to accurately answer difficult questions with full context of large, complex, and even multi-repo codebases.\nSimple RAG alone is not sufficient for this task. Codebases aren’t like most PDFs, docs, or other similar data types. They are graphs—complex puzzle…",

Steps in the workflow (builders) are chained together based on a topologically sorted built from the predefined input & output.\n3.

          "description": "I am excited to announce the project I am working on: an advanced mobile app profiler for Android. Its primary purpose is to optimize app performance and make it faster. Additionally, it serves as an excellent debugging tool.\nThe main distinction between existing tools, such as Perfetto and the Android Studio Profiler, is the ability to synchronize the trace with a video recording of your app. This allows you to see the app's UX alongside what's occurring within the app to identify what's causing slowdowns.\nAnother key feature is the ability to click on any slice and view the cross-thread execution path of function calls, tracing from a user action to the selected slice. This makes it easier to identify performance regressions: slow functions, suboptimal network calls, or functions clogging the main thread.\nAdditionally, we have implemented smart code instrumentation that has a minimal impact on performance.\nI am one of the developers of this tool. The project is in active development and are eager for feedback from Android developers. You can try it out at https://crpath.app\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39543275\nPoints: 10\n# Comments: 0",

I built an open-source data copy tool called ingestr (https://github.com/bruin-data/ingestr)\nI did build quite a few data warehouses both for the companies I worked at, as well as for consultancy projects. One of the more common pain points I observed was that everyone had to rebuild the same data ingestion bit over and over again, and each in different ways:\n- some wrote code for the ingestion from scratch to various degrees\n- some used off-the-shelf data ingestion tools like Fivetran / Airbyte\nI have always disliked both of these approaches, for different reasons, but never got around to working on what I'd imagine to be the better way forward.\nThe solutions that required writing code for copying the data had quite a bit of overhead such as how to generalize them, w…",

          "description": "Hey HN, I’m Pierce. Today I’m open sourcing a beta of Mountaineer, an integrated framework for building webapps in React and Python.\nI’ve written a good 25+ webapps over the last few years in almost every major framework under the sun. Python and React remain my favorite. They let you get started quickly and grow to scale. But the developer experience of linking these two worlds remains less than optimal:\n— Sharing typehints and schemas across frontend and backend code\n— Scattered fetch() calls to template data and modify server objects\n— Server side rendering / gateway support\n— Error handling on frontend fetches\nMountaineer is an attempt to solve those problems. I didn’t want to re-invent the wheel of what Python and React are good at, so it’s relatively light on syntax. It provides one frontend hook for React apps and introduces a MVC convention on the backend for managing views. Support files are generated progressively through a local watcher, so IDE type-hints and function calls work out of the box.\nIt’s more intuitive to explain with some code, so pop over to the Github if you’re interested in this stack and taking a look:\nGithub: https://github.com/piercefreeman/mountaineer\nMore context: https://freeman.vc/notes/mountaineer-v01-webapps-in-python-a...\nWould love to hear your thoughts!\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39524874\nPoints: 89\n# Comments: 34",

We help companies get HIPAA compliant fast, with 1-click infrastructure, streamlined legal policies, and real-time monitoring. Here’s a quick demo: https://youtu.be/mQbb5mprsUA.\nHIPAA is a US federal law passed back in 1996 that sets standards for protecting sensitive health information. Here’s an article that breaks it down pretty simply: https://www.getdelve.com/blog/quick-guide-to-hipaa.\nMost companies that process health information in the US need to become HIPAA compliant, a process that can be long and expensive. At our previous health tech company, we spent 6 weeks (and tens of thousands of dollars) on getting compliant.

There are thousands of cool personal sites out there, with amazing ideas on them, but there’s nowhere to easily search through. So we built a simple site that indexes 7k+ personal sites [0]. We were inspired by Derek Sivers’ Now page movement [1] and other IndieWeb directories [2], but we figured that it would be more useful if we:\n* Let you search directly across personal sites without having to visit them\n* Take the content from 3 specific pages, /about, /now and /ideas, to structure everything\n* Define /ideas pages as a space to articulate things you want to work on\nWe hope this’ll be a cool place for people to find others to collaborate with - would love your feedback. If you’d like your site to appear at the top, add it via the form and add a last updated date of today (any format). It’s completely open source (MIT) and open to contributions [3]!\nPeter & Louis\n[0] gathered from: 1) https://nownownow.com and similar sites 2) checking all HN posts since 2020 with more than 100 upvotes\n[1] https://nownownow.com\n[2] https://personalsit.es\n[3] https://github.com/lindylearn/aboutideasnow\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39511714\nPoints: 302\n# Comments: 74",

Today we’re excited to share R2R (https://github.com/SciPhi-AI/R2R), an open-source framework that makes it simpler to develop and deploy production-grade RAG systems.\nJust a quick reminder: RAG helps Large Language Models (LLMs) use current information and specific knowledge. For example, it allows a programming assistant to use your latest documents to answer questions. The idea is to gather all the relevant information (\"retrieval\") and present it to the LLM with a question (\"augmentation\"). This way, the LLM can provide answers (“generation”) as though it was trained directly on your data.\nThe R2R framework is a powerful tool for addressing key challenges in d…",

          "description": "Hi friends, I've been making attempts for over 4 years now to make money from my pet-project and finally leave my job and never think of it again. I do small saas and. online projects (sites under amazon).\nBut I am saddened by the fact that I invest hundreds, thousands of hours of my personal time, spent 5 000$ on testing, experiments with advertising, quit my job, worked fulltime for the last year - and still still never managed to earn. My result is only $200. Heck, in all 4 years. I want to live this life, to see the beauty of the world - but instead I spend my life working hard and trying to pluck a star from the sky. I want to finally live this life.  To be free.\nI have a question for the community? Where do you find the strength to keep going? What keeps you going and energizes you? I'm tired of trying, the work seems endless. I am grateful for everyone's advice.\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39504470\nPoints: 37\n# Comments: 30",

          "description": "Hey Hackers! My name is Alex and I’ve been working on this project for the past 8 months with the support of Figma Creator Fund. I’d love to hear your thoughts from your experience working with designers & component libraries.\nI started out in design and later got into coding, so I understand both sides really well. I did UX Design for 12 years at startups, at my own studio and at Wix, and then worked as a front-end dev at Wix for 2 more years.\nI've noticed a common problem: most component libraries work great for devs but not so well for designers.\nIn my experience working with big teams, I've felt this frustration firsthand. Instead of focusing on making products, we end up arguing over small details and terms.\nIn Functional UI Kit, each comp has dedicated story in Storybook. Copy pasting from Dev Mode in Figma just works, Figma variables and CSS variables match, auto Layout is mirroring the same box model structure & the CSS architecture shields you from style collisions.\nIt leverages all the latest Figma features to the MAX. Including the latest: Annotations, and of course: Dark Mode.\nI hope you try it and let me know what you think.\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39504200\nPoints: 19\n# Comments: 2",

          "description": "For years, I have been obtaining free annual credit reports (annualcreditreport.com) which must be provided by law. Recently, for the first time, when I tried to obtain my Equifax report, I was prompted for an email address and a mobile phone number, a new requirement that apparently cannot be bypassed.  The other two bureaus, and Equifax previously, confirmed identity by asking knowledge based questions.  They do not need my phone or email for anything.\nNext, trying to obtain the report by phone instead of web site per instructions, I got to the point where I entered my ZIP code on the phone keypad, the voice menu system correctly repeated the number back to me, but every time I press 1 to indicate it is correct, the system acts like it got an invalid response and only gives me the option to enter further information by voice, not by the phone keypad.  Just as with my phone number and email, they do not need to record my voice to provide my report.\nI wrote a complaint to the annualcreditreport firm earlier this week, no response yet.\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39485259\nPoints: 50\n# Comments: 15",

          "description": "I love urban planning and think the way we interact with the built environment is hugely impactful to individuals. But I also think that most people have been trained to take the built environment as a given rather than something that they have partial ownership of. By building a place to discuss their community on a hyper-local scale, I’m hoping to encourage residents to feel like they are an important piece of their city.\nI thought building a sort of spatial forum, where city residents can discuss the little annoyances in their neighborhoods, might help people a) start thinking about which parts of the built environment bug them and b) realize that other people in their neighborhood probably have the same complaint. Of course, I know that local politics can turn nasty quickly, hence the name of the site: I’m hoping to keep discussion focused on potential fixes for each problem.\nIf you’re excited about this but your city isn’t on the list, I’m happy to add it as long as you promise to make at least one post. It’s extra helpful if you go to geojson.io and create GeoJson for a closed polygon that marks where you think the bounds for your city should be (doesn’t need to correlate with official city boundaries), but I’m happy to guess and do that part myself. Let me know here or by email if you want your city added!\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39484685\nPoints: 39\n# Comments: 12",

          "description": "Last summer there was an Ask HN[1] about a Nature article that said bluring the blue and green color channels on screen may be good against early myopia development. The OP wanted such software and there was none available.\nSo I quit my job and implemented this software, did a short video with a 3D artist about it.\nTurns out marketing is expensive, so I made an open source browser extension version too.\nHow it works?\nThere is a small neural network on the retina that tries to detect if the eye is far-sighted(most people are born far-sighted), and it is producing dopamine to slow or increase eye growth rate. It is not very smart, and if you do a lot of near-work it can think you are still hyperopic, causing further myopia progression.\nSo, based on the refractive properties of the eye the software calculates the signal that would convince the retinal neural network that the eye is long enough, so it would produce dopamine, a known signal to stop axial eye growth. (based on myopic defocus LCA from the papers[2][3])\nSome myopia control techniques work similarly, like MiSight and Hoya lenses.\nSince then I got a Neurobiologist co-founder and the goal is to best understand the Retinal NN to create the best anti-myopic effect that does not interfere with productivity.\nThe effect can be tried live on the site. Also check out the github repo. Any questions suggestions welcome!\n[1] https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37019143\n[2] https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-26323-7\n[3] https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S00144...\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39484590\nPoints: 4\n# Comments: 2",

          "description": "Hi all, excited to share our latest work, OK-Robot, which is an open and modular framework to perform navigation and manipulation with a robot assistant in practically any homes without having to teach the robot anything new! You can simply unbox the target robot, install OK-Robot, give it a \"scan\" (think a 60 second iPhone video), and start asking the robot to move arbitrary things from A to B. We already tested it out in 10 home environments in New York city, and one environment each in Pittsburgh and Fremont.\nWe based everything off of the current best machine learning models, and so things don't quite work perfectly all the time, so we are hoping to build it together with the community! Our code is open: https://github.com/ok-robot/ok-robot and we have a Discord server for discussion and support: https://discord.gg/wzzZJxqKYC If you are curious what works and what doesn't work, take a quick look at https://ok-robot.github.io/#analysis or read our paper for a detailed analysis: https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.12202\nP.S.: while the code is open the project unfortunately isn't fully open source since one of our dependencies, AnyGrasp, has a closed-source, educational license. Apologize in advance, but we used it since that was the best grasping model we could have access to!\nWould love to hear more thoughts and feedback on this project!\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39483482\nPoints: 278\n# Comments: 52",

We’re building an open source and self-hostable ChatGPT-style system that can access your team’s unique knowledge by connecting to 25 of the most common workplace tools (Slack, Google Drive, Jira, etc.). You ask questions in natural language and get back answers based on your team’s documents. Where relevant, answers are backed by citations and links to the exact documents used to generate them.\nQuick Demo: https://youtu.be/hqSouur2FXw\nOriginally Danswer was a side project motivated by a challenge we experienced at work.

You select the GitHub repo where your site/app is at (whether it's Next.js, 11ty, Hugo, Nuxt... as long as you're using flat files for content).\n3. You add a single config file to your repo to define the content types and other settings (e.g. media folder).\n4. Congrats: you now have a user friendly CMS to manage content + media BUT all changes are still tracked like regular commits (under your account) on GitHub.\nI started using Jekyll around 2009 and over the course of the past 10+ years, I've helped build major sites and tiny blogs with Hugo, Gatsby, Next.js and more recently 11ty.\nI still love it.\nBUT once you're done building, managing content and media can be a bit of a pain.

This whole project was something I needed myself since I got over 20 products and paying for an external one would simply cost too much.\nMy initial idea was that I would just build an internal tool for my use, that has only 1 feature. No UI really, just 1 button.\nIn the middle of the process, I realized that I could actually run an experiment and launch this tool publically with just one feature.

Dart is a fully-featured project management tool that can automatically create reports, fill in task properties, generate subtasks, detect duplicate tasks, and more. Here’s a quick demo of some of the highlight features: https://youtu.be/CMsBAv9CCyU\nLike many others we grew frustrated with the constant upkeep in creating and organizing tickets in Jira and other PM tools. We routinely wasted as much as seven hours a week on repetitive PM chores like cleaning up the backlog or drafting changelog updates. At Zack’s previous company he even built a system to try to automate some of this work. In conversations with other founders and engineers we learned that he was far from the only person doing this.\nWe started Dart wh…",

          "description": "Hello HN,\nI'm releasing Hyperdiv (https://hyperdiv.io), a framework for rapidly developing reactive browser UIs in Python, with immediate-mode syntax and using Shoelace (https://shoelace.style) as its built-in component system.\nThis short coding video will give you a good idea of what it is: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4XJKfxaqvGE\nI wrote a brief article about the motivation and approach: https://hyperdiv.io/intro.html\nHyperdiv doesn't aim to compete with serious full-stack frameworks. The core aim was to make it easy and fast to prototype apps and build UI-based tools. I was originally motivated by internal tools at work -- feeling the need to quickly put together UI-based tools to share with both technical and non-technical coworkers, without having to stand up and maintain a full internal stack.\nThis is my first major open source release. I really appreciate your feedback and support. - Marius\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39441677\nPoints: 45\n# Comments: 18",

Its like sudoku but with a geometric angle, the sum of the dots must match the row and column numbers.\nIt's running on Betsy, the server under my couch, and was made with typescript. I'm proud of it.\nI hope you give it a shot, and appreciate any thoughts or criticisms!\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39420966\nPoints: 52\n# Comments: 26",

It's built in PICO-8, which is a really fun “fantasy retro console” that's been mentioned on HN several times. The console has strict limits and I wanted to see how far I could push them\nThe source code for the game is over here: https://github.com/maxbize/PICO-8/tree/master/Driftmania. It's a bit of a mess, but I'm happy to answer any questions on it or development of the game. Cheers!\nEDIT: For those not familiar with PICO-8, there's only a few inputs: arrow keys, Z/C/N, and X/V/M\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39402142\nPoints: 71\n# Comments: 27",

          "description": "Hey everyone! Akash and Gabe here from Zenfetch (https://www.zenfetch.com) - a Chrome extension that transforms your saved web browsing into a personal chatGPT and search engine. Here’s a demo video: https://www.loom.com/share/abe9d40dc82545a482be55b631f9bf2a?...\nHow it works: (1) Optionally import your existing saved web browsing through one of our integrations or through a URL CSV import. (2) Click the Zenfetch icon in a tab to save any PDF, YouTube video, note, article, email, forum post, etc. Zenfetch can save almost anything across the internet. (3) Zenfetch indexes the text or transcript and adds that information to your personal knowledge assistant. This is done on your computer so you don’t have to worry about paywalls, logins, etc. (4) Use the dashboard or side panel to search your knowledge or chat with your personal knowledge assistant.\nWe built Zenfetch to solve our personal problem: we were reading tons of content but using little to none of the information. While searching for solutions, we found that most tools were good at storing information but not at retrieving it. We even found that search functionalities on existing read-later tools got worse the more content we saved.\nA few examples of how our users use Zenfetch: “What was that article I read on the new nuclear fusion company?”, “Analyze this strategy based on the Lenny Rachitsky article I read”, “Summarize Karpathys video introducing LLMs”, “Which research papers mentioned the increase in carbon emissions?”, “Compile the different perspectives I’ve read on climate change”, and more.\nZenfetch is free for the first 14 days and then costs $14.99/mo (No credit card needed for the trial).\nWe’d love for you to try it out and let us know what we can do to improve your experience! While we only work on Chromium-based browsers right now, we’re actively working on browser compatibility and integrations. Let us know which ones to prioritize!\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39385635\nPoints: 54\n# Comments: 22",

          "description": "Hi, I've created an application where you can follow step by step origami fold instructions, and a Creator where you can make these interactive folds.\nOn comparing to video instructions, you have the ability to quickly skip/rewind steps and replay a complicated step many times.\nOn the creation side, there have been one or two attempts at this before, but those solutions rely on mouse drags as the user interface. This greatly limited the kinds of folds possible. The foldMation Creator uses commands, keywords and values to compose a domain specific language/step and provides a (relatively speaking) easy to use user interface to compose the steps.\nFor those interested in using the Creator, please go through the tutorial at the top of the create page.\nBtw, the DSL for foldMation uses https://github.com/mationai/mation-spec. I created it since I couldn't find anything out there that is similar, allowing me to specify a well structured data with English-like readable syntax.\nLet me know what you think?\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39373800\nPoints: 28\n# Comments: 7",

          "description": "Hi HN- Today, we are releasing the hosted API for our natural language to SQL engine, which allows you to:\n(1) Explain Your Data: Feed in dictionaries, dbt, schemas, Confluence docs - we'll understand the business context to your data.\n(2) Train Your AI: Fine-tune an LLM (including GPT-4) specifically for your data, increasing accuracy and lowering latency\n(3) Trust the Answer: See confidence scores with each AI-generated query, stay in control.\n(4) Conduct complex SQL queries\nProblem background - Developers struggle to build NL-to-SQL into products because LLMs do not work out-of-the-box; they lack metadata and business definitions. Existing NL-to-SQL tools struggle with context, complexity, and adapting to your data.\nFor example, given the question “what was the average rent in Los Angeles in May 2023?” a reasonable human would either assume the question is about Los Angeles, CA or would confirm the state with the question asker in a follow up. However, an LLM translates this to:\n  select price from rent_prices where city=”Los Angeles” AND month=”05” AND year=”2023”\n\nYou can try it now free – no fees, no credit card, no sales pitches, just get the API key and get going. Let us know if it works for you, even your complex queries. (https://console.dataherald.ai/playground)\nWhile the open source version works just fine (https://github.com/Dataherald/dataherald), the hosted API might be a better fit for those looking for:\n(1) someone else to take care of infrastructure setup, \n(2) access to an Admin UI console where you can configure and monitor performance, and \n(3) ability to invite team members to a project.\nWe're looking for feedback, particularly from anyone who can compare this performance to other NL-to-SQL products. Share your thoughts and join the conversation \nFor more background on the release: https://www.dataherald.com/news/introducing-dhai\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39373744\nPoints: 21\n# Comments: 10",

          "description": "There are quite a few start ups/OSS working on making LLMs do things on your behalf and not just complete your words. These projects range from small atomic actions to  web scrapers to more general ambitious assistants.\nThat all makes sense to me and I think is the right direction to be headed. However, it's been a bit since the inception of some of these projects/cool demos but I haven't seen anyone who uses agents as a core/regular part of their workflow.\nI'm curious if you use these agents regularly or know someone that does. Or if you're working on one of these, I'd love to know what are some of the hidden challenges to making a useful product with agents? What's the main bottle neck?\nAny thoughts are welcome!\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39373662\nPoints: 62\n# Comments: 66",

You can do semantic search + related notes are automatically connected.\n2. You can do RAG Q&A on your notes using the local LLM of your choice.\n3. Embedding model, LLM, vector db and files are all run or stored locally.\n4. Point it to a directory of markdown files (like an Obsidian vault) and it works seamlessly alongside Obsidian.\nUnder the hood, Reor uses Llama.cpp (node-llama-cpp integration), Transformers.js and Lancedb to power the local AI features.\nReor was built right from the start to support local models. The future of knowledge management involves using lots of AI to organize pieces of knowledge - but crucially, that AI should run as much as possible privately & locally.\nIt's available for Mac, Windows & Linux on the project Github: https://github.com/reorproject/reor\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39372159\nPoints: 176\n# Comments: 44",

Much of the increase in adoption/use seems to attributable to India, where adoption/use increased from 8% to 15%. Although Linux adoption/use continues to grow in other regions/markets, growth remained relatively flat last year outside of India.\n As I understand it from reading and from friends, the reason that Linux adoption/use in India has roughly doubled in the last year, and is expected to continue to grow, is that India's Ministry of Electronics & Information Technology (MeitY) has been aggressively pushing BOSS, an India-centric Debian-based distribution developed by C-DAC, an autonomous society of MeitY.\n As I think about the developments in India, t…",

          "description": "With the release of the Raspberry Pi 5, the development of Asahi Linux, and the upcoming release of the Snapdragon X Elite processor, it seems the ARM devices are becoming more and more viable as desktop computing alternatives. Flatpak can handle different architectures, you can even install it on Raspberry Pi OS and download packages for the ARM architecture, however many applications are only built for x86_64 systems.\n I searched online for a bit, and it seems you can use QEMU to run x86_64 on ARM (or vice-versa) and it seems to work quite well (link). I've also searched trying to see if there is an easy way to run flatpaks using Box64, but I haven't found any straightforward instructions.\n When Apple introduced M1 they automatically handled app architecture translation using Rosetta.\n So my question to all of you is, should Flatpak consider automatically running x86_64 applications using box64/box86 for ARM devices? Is it a difficult thing to accomplish? Would integrating QEMU be a more viable option?\n    submitted by    /u/fcrv  \n [link]   [comments]",

After that, I tend to uninstall or not use those tools anymore (in the case of Tauri and that kind of dev tools), but by doing that it leaves me with a bunch of packages in the system that I manually installed, and now I don't know exactly which packages are in use or are just leftovers there that are updated every day.\n Then I discovered Brew and what I thought was: \"What if I use Brew just to install my dev tools and track what I use or not from there\", seriously, Almost every time I do an update there is a pile of \"rust-{whatever}\" to be updated.\n Does this make any sense? There is a better way to handle the leftovers of dev tools and packages manually installed to build from source?\n P.S: Now I tend to manually note what I'm installing to manually uninstall it too, as a workaround.\n    submitted by    /u/pkcarreno  \n [link]   [comments]",

Additionally, the sdmemprogram is invoked to wipe the unused RAM, preventing the keys from being retained in the disk cache (within the RAM). It is assumed that the passphrase used to decrypt the LUKS keychain is securely handled by cryptsetup, as it is directly accepted by cryptsetup without intermediary applications. In the scenario where the encrypted LUKS keychain is used, there is no password caching with keyscript=decrypt_keyctl.\n Is there anything else we can do to ensure that the unnecessary copies of the keys from the encrypted container (LUKS keychain) and the passphrase for that container are removed from the RAM?\n    submitted by    /u/vstoykov  \n [link]   [comments]",

A talking point I see come up a lot in linux desktop conversations is font rendering and how people usually say it sucks, but enabling stem darkening for freetype (linux's font rendering engine) largely fixes the issue entirely.\n ​\n https://blog.aktsbot.in/no-more-blurry-fonts.html\n The difference in font legibility after pasting this one line into /etc/environment and rebooting is crazy\n Stem darkening is what macOS uses to get their fonts looking so crisp. Of course, you're not going to get the same level of fidelity if you're not using an Apple retina display, but even on my average 1080p monitor this makes a huge difference. Why is this option not enabled on any distro? What's the point in having this option built into freetype and leaving it unconfigured for every desktop user?

I used Linux back in high school for my IT classes, I used it on my personal laptop, and I've switched between Linux and Windows over the years on my main PC. I also use Linux at work and work with Linux servers often. \n Back in September, I switched to Linux Mint 21 as my daily driver. My goal was to use Windows as sparingly as humanly possible. I did it for myself and my privacy, but I also wanted to prove some points, and one of those points was, you can use Linux Mint without using the terminal at all. And... I was correct. \n People, especially skeptics (who don't even use the OS), say that Linux is complicated and you can't do anything without opening up the terminal. I use Linux daily for browsing the internet, being in calls with friends, playing games like Sea of Theives, Battlefield, GTA, and much more. I use it for work, education, and even to record and edit. So far, since September, I haven't needed the terminal for anything. I installed via the GUI; either by going to the official site, or going through the software store. \n ​\n I also helped prove to one of my friends that Linux isn't as bad as it used to be, even letting him play some games and use the system for a while. He's willing to install a small 500GB drive with a Linux distro on it. I consider that a win since he's normally worried about games and other software not working like it should. \n Since you've been using Linux, what is something you would like to bring to the table that might be considered helpful for new people / outsiders. Mine obviously was, with the right distro, you won't need the terminal, it's helpful but not vital. \n    submitted by    /u/BouncyPancake  \n [link]   [comments]",

I used Ventoy to write today's daily build isos to one USB stick. Any issues I report are *not* intended as criticisms of that flavour since these daily builds are *not* expected to necessarily be stable, particularly at this stage.\n Booting: All the flavours booted successfully. All of them ran the desktop environment successfully except Kubuntu, where KDE Plasma kept crashing if you did just about anything.\n X11/Wayland: Nothing to see here as the live environments all use X11 as a safe default, they will switch to Wayland in some cases when actually installed.\n Pipewire/Pulseaudio: All fully switched from pulse to pipewire apart from Kylin and Unity which remain on pulse as of today. (Didn't check if Studio runs Jack as well or something, I was basically looking to see if pulse was gone).\n Installers: All switched to use subiquity with the new snap/flutter interface by default, apart from Kubuntu, Mate and Unity, which currently remain on on the old ubiquity installer, and Lubuntu, which uses calamares. I believe Kubuntu is supposed to be switching to calamares as well. When I tried starting the installers, for three flavours the new installer just hung before even displaying its first screen.\n ​\n ​\n    submitted by    /u/mikechant  \n [link]   [comments]",

Apart from gaming she doesn't come from a technical background at all, and It's been going mostly great, it's been reliable and she's been able to figure out most things herself. I chose Mint because of the many recommendations especially for beginners.\n But, now I wanted to help her install a youtube-dl GUI. I installed one from the software manager, but it was outdated and broken (since yt-dlp kinda needs monthly updates to stay working). I spent some time and finally found some AppImage that gets the newest yt-dl version on start. But I assume it will break at some point because of course AppImage does not integrate with the system package manager and my gf will not be able to update it herself.\n Then, I wanted to install KDE Connect. The software manager has it! But it's three years old. I didn't even bother installing it because I really don't want to deal with an issue that then turns out to have been fixed two years ago. The official instructions say to use the package manager version.\n I then looked for flatpaks or other releases and apparently they did have some flatpaks of KDE Connect at some point but not anymore.\n On my laptop with Arch, I just search the official packages and get kdeconnect in the most current version. Same goes for the yt-dl gui. It pretty much always just works.\n How does everyone else deal with this problem? I understand for some software it's fine to have a slow release cycle (esp. on servers), but for lots of desktop apps it seems like such a time sink to deal with old software.\n    submitted by    /u/tehdog  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Over the past 20 years I have tried linux on new, old, weird, sometimes easy machines. I feel like the main thing limiting Linux as an operating system for me and others I know is the sheer amount of errors you can run into, and its so many that it's very difficult to search for them. What makes things worse is whenever you ask a question, you often times get somebody recommending a different distro even on a community dedicated to one. It makes it look like distro-hopping is the only recommended troubleshooting tip for noobs lol.\n People regularly give me computers of various ages and styles, and I like to dedicate them to specific tasks such as 3D printing or running a laser cutter. I always start by downloading like eight or so linux distros, and giving them all a go for the weekend. Sadly like today I regularly can't get many distros to get into the setup process because they have instant errors in the loading process. It's especially bad if you're trying to load onto some strange hardware such as an HP server or a Fujitsu tablet. Things such as Dell Optiplexes are more straightforward, but here lately I've ran into odd issues I can't even really understand. Non-descript (Or sometimes so descript it'd be understandable if you have a logic analyzer hooked up) errors that overlap with a lot of other errors people have for other instances.\n I almost feel like it's somehow gotten harder to get a linux distro to work. If I can't get my foot in the door, then I can't really have any room to learn or try anything. I remember DSL working for my old laptops back in the mid 2000s, and I had slightly better luck with distros in the 2009-2014 era. It used to be that I would spend two or three days trying out linux for something but now the distros fail so fast that after a few hours it feels like a waste of time for no progress. \n Sometimes I feel like computing instead of using an OS as a tool, but Linux doesn't feel like computing on some of those days either lol\n    submitted by    /u/RinoaSG  \n [link]   [comments]",

To me the moment I start these programs they'll burrow a rootkit in my machine that I won't be able to remove -- this I accept as a given in the situation. My user has an unlimited passwordless sudo access and I won't change that, it's convenient for me.\n So how would you do your very best to still run these programs and make full use of them but give them the absolute minimum -- or zero -- that they can abuse for their own gains?\n I am thinking a few things:\n  \nDifferent Linux user.\n Isolation via Flatpak or any other such runtime (I don't know of more than 2-3).\n Maybe using virtual QubesOS.\n  \n...and this is where my ideas end, and I still don't know where to even begin.\n Have any of you done this? What would you recommend? Do you have good step-by-step articles?\n Any thoughts and ideas are welcome but please, I'd appreciate if we don't have the \"you are too paranoid\" or \"you got nothing worth stealing\" etc. comments. I am interested in a technical discussion that is a bit paranoid indeed, because I am also interested in security and Linux is notorious for not paying much attention to that.

Therefore, even though I was impressed by how the distro was organized, I didn't stay for long.\n So after an exchange with a Void Linux user here on Reddit, I decided to give it another try. And I must say that I am really impressed by it. It boots incredibly fast, and has a very versatile package manager. Everything that I needed on my machine was readily available, even interception-tools. The only thing that I had to manually install is the dual-function-keys plugin for the interception tools.\n The handbook is also very useful to get you started. It helped me to understand how to set up the graphical session and how to enable services.\n Here it is: https://docs.voidlinux.org/\n Overall, I plan to keep it on my secondary machine for now, but I do not exclude it becoming my main distro. \n So, if you are searching for a new, simple distro, and you are familiar with CLI, please consider Void Linux.

          "description": "I have experience with Windоws, OSX, and Linux distributions like Ubuntu, Fedora, and Debian. In my opinion, the font rendering on Linux, especially outside of Ubuntu, has been noticeably worse. I'm curious about the reasons behind this. \n OSX, on the other hand, offers the best font rendering, leading me to speculate whether Apple's involvement in both hardware and software contributes to this superior experience. To test this theory, I connected my MacBook to an external monitor, and the font quality remained impressive.\n While Windows falls somewhere in the middle in terms of font quality compared to OSX, Linux, with the exception of Ubuntu (which is somewhat similar to Windows but slightly worse), exhibits notably poor font rendering. This raises questions about why an operating system heavily utilized for text-based tools, like the terminal, would struggle with font clarity.\n Could it be due to Linux's historical focus on servers, where font aesthetics are less critical? Alternatively, is the blame on the desktop environments? I've experimented with various ones, including Gnome, Cinnamon, KDE, and Xfce, as well as the i3 window manager, but haven't observed significant differences.\n What intrigues me further is the relatively small number of people expressing concerns about this issue. I find myself at a loss; I genuinely enjoy using GNU/Linux, but the subpar font rendering makes it challenging for me to fully commit. Any insights or suggestions on this matter would be greatly appreciated.\n    submitted by    /u/lMrXQl  \n [link]   [comments]",

Recently, as the title says, I’ve come up with a way for newer Linux users to sift through all the garbage out there and find a distro, base, and DE that works for them easily and quickly. It took me a lot of work, but I’m excited to share it with you all! I call it the Linux Distro Dichotomous Key, and it uses the system to classify organisms scientifically, to help people find a distro and DE for them. Try running through it and see how accurate it is! If you have any feedback for me, I turned comments on on the google doc, and you can comment here! Excited to see what people can do with this, and thank you for reading!\n The key: https://docs.google.com/document/d/12ZKOucf81Da_9-Q1VTfATeDDk433_ryEyWR9ph95hKI/edit\n Edit: u/codenamek83 has also brought another distro choosing resource to my attention, be sure to check this out too! https://www.distrochooser.de\n    submitted by    /u/TheAskerOfThings  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I’m trying run LLM on Steam deck. It works fine with KoboldCPP. I use Vulkan, so it can use GPU and shared memory. But I found, when I load 13b models, there is error:\n .radv/amdgpu: Not enough memory for command submission\n I found when the model loads more then 8GB to memory (for GPU, because in RAM only for CPU it works), it wrote this error. So there must be some limit set for maximum memory share for GPU to 8GB of RAM. Steam deck have 16GB RAM. \n The question is, is there any way how to set more RAM GPU can share? Or the GPU have its limitation? \n I run kernel.shmmax and get this number and it looks like it’s set to maximum memory shared 18446744073692774399.\n So it’s possible to set more shared RAM then 8GB or it can be hardware limited? \n Thanks for any advice!🙏\n    submitted by    /u/FrostyMisa  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I don't know, I'm probably in the minority here, but why is it so complicated (or nobody is willing) to implement something as simple as a terminal emulator that behaves like a GUI text editor? Editing stuff is intuitive, for example, selecting something in the middle of a command that you're writing and replacing it with something else: you just... select that part with the mouse and start writing over it. That's it.\n I've tried multiple terminals, even some with limited mouse support, but nothing comes even close to this. And the idea seems pretty straightforward: a textbox where you write commands and then you execute them. \n I'd gladly use any open source alternative to this, but for the moment I think I'll stick with this one... even if it's closed source and requires login, which I'm not a fan of.\n    submitted by    /u/SomethingOfAGirl  \n [link]   [comments]",

The version what you find in any package repos (including Flatpak) is the 1.x, since the 2.x is paid. However, the 1.x version is currently unmaintained, and only gets security patches and fixes, while the 2.x is the most recent version. However, as the page says, it's currently in early access, which means it may contain some bugs and unfinished features.\n So my question is: anybody tried it? Is it worth paying at least US$ 3.49 regarding the early access? I mean, I want to support the project since the 1.x is amazing, but I want to know what should I keep in mind before the purchase.\n Thank you.\n    submitted by    /u/jorgicio  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Good day everyone, for the last year I have slowly been working on an immutable Arch-based distro called Arkane Linux, I have slowly been advertising it around a bit, and so far the responses have been very positive!\n Note that the distro is Beta, it is in a state where it is very much daily drivable, but there is still some polishing which has to be done.\n Arkane Linux uses a custom toolkit called Arkdep to build and manage an immutable system based on Btrfs subvolumes. Arkdep is build to be as simple as possible, and unlike other immutable distros it is trivial to spin your own images for it. Arkane Linux mostly serves as a testing ground, reference implementation and my personal configuration of Arkdep.\n I try to differentiate the distro from other immutable offerings by keeping it all as minimalisitic as possible. I also try to properly document the underlying technology, this is something I have noticed other immutable distros to be lacking, to allow other people to easily utilize it to build their own personal configurations.\n By default the distro provides a minimal collection of core applications, it ships with everything one would expect to be present to have a full featured desktop and nothing more.\n The whole core idea is that if you do not like this config you can build your own with the provided tools. As an experiment I build a KDE version, it took me 10 minutes to spin a KDE image adapted from the GNOME config. And if you do like my configuration; GREAT! Enjoy! it is available and free for all!\n If anyone here is willing grab it and test it for issues or provide feedback, please do!\n Website: https://arkanelinux.org\n Github (Stars please, I need dopamine): https://github.com/arkanelinux\n Matrix (I set it up just now): https://matrix.to/#/%23arkanelinux:matrix.org\n I also got Arkane Linux listed on distrowatch waiting list, if you think the project is neat please give it an upvote there aswel.\n    submitted by    /u/arkane-linux  \n [link]   [comments]",

They work, but often lag behind in term of features and bugfixes.\n Nvidia also released an open source kernel module (actively maintained?), that can be used as alternative to the closed one. Beta state and no clear intention to get it into the official kernel tree.\n The open kernel module allows nouveau and NVK to build a fully open driver that in a future could be competitive with the one from NVIDIA.\n  \nI'm not sure where nvidia is heading there. Are they hoping that NVK reaches a good level maturity and then support that directly (like AMD used to have both closed and open driver but then ditched the former?). Is the open kernel driver just another very indirect helping hand to nouveau to get the basics working on linux so you can open a browser and install the proprietary driver?\n    submitted by    /u/Johnsmtg  \n [link]   [comments]",

Windows can do everything you need at home but it does everything equally poorly; it's not Microsoft's fault but rather a necessary compromise. With Linux, I can build my own system that does best exactly the things I want to be done best. Of course, there is a compromise too: my Linux is pretty bad at the things I do not care for.

          "description": "“kmod” is an ELF file which is located at “/bin/kmod”, by the way “/bin” is usually a symbolic link to “/usr/bin” so we can find the binary at “/usr/bin/kmod”. It is used mainly for managing Linux kernel modules (https://linux-kernel-labs.github.io/refs/heads/master/labs/kernel_modules.html). It is important to understand that “kmod” is a multi-call binary that implements utilities used to manage kernel modules. Hence, most users will not run it directly (https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man8/kmod.8.html).\n Overall, by using “kmod” we can load/remove/insert/show information/resolve dependencies of kernel modules (https://linuxhint.com/linux-kmod-command/). “kmod” is developed by Lucas De Marchi (https://github.com/kmod-project/kmod).\n Lastly, the most well known utilities used to control kernel modules are just symbolic links to “kmod” examples are: lsmod, rmmod, modinfo, modprobe and depmod (more on those in future writeups) — as shown in the screenshot below. \n https://preview.redd.it/fs5dhzcf5mic1.png?width=834&format=png&auto=webp&s=1a7410acbf850f84eabc333e6c61b2fe39a9e298\n    submitted by    /u/boutnaru  \n [link]   [comments]",

Likewise, the idea is that the window manager can choose to reparent windows (give them decorations, like close, minimize, maximize, etc), or they can choose not to and leave the window borders bare. \n I quite like this because I have no use of window frames and just control my windows with the keyboard, so they are wasted space, but I am becoming concerned because it seems like Wayland leaves this decision to the client windows themselves. I really do not like this, because I don't want my windows to have frames that I never use, and I would really prefer if I could enforce that within my own WM. I hope I'm really misinterpreting something I've read that lead me to this belief, so I'm hoping somebody will clear this up for me. \n THanks :L\n    submitted by    /u/nerdycatgamer  \n [link]   [comments]",

I am a Linux daily user for work, and dual booting in private, and while I love Linux, a small annoyance (for me) on the Linux Desktop (mostly pop os) is problems with handling \"errors\" like program crashes.\n Most of my \"problems\" come from games that require a full screen, but not exclusively. For example, when running the game Battlebit, I would sometimes experience it crashing, but not shutting down, and remaining on the screen. The crashing isn't the problem, Linux support is always a bit hit or miss, and I somewhat expect that with many titles. The issue was that afterward, I was unable to shut down the application without restarting the machine. I have experienced this a few times. When I open the system monitor and force shutting it down, it just isn't working. Where I feel like on Windows with the task manager this seems to work more often (not always of course).\n But what has your experience been?

          "description": "Monolithic kernel is an operating system architecture in which the entire OS code is executed in kernel mode. Examples of operating systems which use this design are: Linux, BSD, SunOS, AIX, MS-DOS, OpenVMS, HP-UX, TempleOS, z/TPF, XTS-400, Solaris, FreeBSD and MULTICS (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monolithic_kernel).\n Thus, the kernel provides CPU scheduling, file management, memory management, IPC and more (as opposed to microkernel) — as shown in the diagram below. There are a couple of advantages when using this design like: we can use a single static binary for the kernel, we can access all the capabilities of the kernel using system calls and we can get a single execution flow in a single address space (https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/monolithic-kernel-and-key-differences-from-microkernel/).\n Moreover, probably the biggest disadvantage of a monolithic kernel design is that in case of a service failure the entire system fails. A monolithic kernel can be extended (without recompilation and linking) only if it is modular. Linux it is done using loadable kernel modules, the support for that is defined by enabling “CONFIG_MODULES” which compiling the kernel (https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/latest/source/Makefile#L1106).\n Lastly, in kernel version 6.7.4 “CONFIG_MODULES” is referenced in 158 files across the kernel source code files (https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/latest/A/ident/CONFIG_MODULES).\n ​\n https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/monolithic-kernel-and-key-differences-from-microkernel/\n    submitted by    /u/boutnaru  \n [link]   [comments]",

This is handled transparently by the address handling functions in the C library.\"\n Why isn't there a similar note for the IPv4 pages, recommending using the IPv6 or version agnostic functions to at least improve IPv6 adoption of newly written code?\n    submitted by    /u/antoo98  \n [link]   [comments]",

Particularly, about some kind of potential disputes between him and Linus with two different, internally competing versions of Linux. Looking him up on the web, I was surprised to find no Wikipedia page or any seemingly recent digital footprint or mention of the man. \n I've only found old articles from the mid to late 90's, detailing his involvement in the community. I saw that he was a co-founder of a company called ARIS, which if I'm correct in my assumption is still around today, but no mention of Kempen. I also saw that he apparently had a dispute with another Linux community member Alan Cox. \n Most notably, Kempen sold the Linux.com domain, a domain he had originally made for purely communal/recreational means and not commercial purposes, for an undisclosed amount of money but less than the 5 million dollar top bid. But then after that, he just seems to disappear. Does anyone know what happened to this figure? \n    submitted by    /u/Khafaniking  \n [link]   [comments]",

A secondary group is one/more groups which a user is also part of in parallel to the primary group (https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/605531/primary-vs-secondary-groups-in-linux).\n Thus, when creating a new user by using the “useradd” (https://linux.die.net/man/8/useradd) command the user is added to a new primary group which has the same name as the user. In order to create new groups we can use the “groupadd” (https://linux.die.net/man/8/groupadd) command — as shown in the screenshot below. When adding users to groups we can use the “gpasswd” (https://linux.die.net/man/1/gpasswd), those are added as secondary groups- as also shown in the screenshot below.\n Lastly, the configuration of secondary groups is stored in “/etc/group” (https://www.baeldung.com/linux/primary-vs-secondary-groups). We can also say that secondary groups are those groups which already created users are added (https://www.networkworld.com/article/3409781/mastering-user-groups-on-linux.html). \n ​\n https://preview.redd.it/cz4evema8lhc1.png?width=594&format=png&auto=webp&s=0386ce1f1495ed501d5908a2d884a1d5b933050f\n    submitted by    /u/boutnaru  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hi!\n I use sticky keys and it truly is wonderful since it makes the computer act more like a modal editor everywhere.\n For those unaware: Sticky keys allows you to perform keybindings without holding the modifier keys down, you instead just press them. So Ctrl+f (hold Ctrl, press f) becomes Ctrl, f (press Ctrl, press f). Sticky keys can also be locked, like Caps Lock, so that you don't have to press, say Ctrl, Shift, arrow, Ctrl, shift, arrow, ... to mark the words of a longer sentence, you just lock Ctrl and Shift and then push the arrow (it becomes like a \"marking mode\").\n For me, there has always been a big problem with Sticky keys: there isn't (to my knowledge) any simple way to see which keys are being \"held down\", which means that you can accidentally press, say Ctrl+w in a browser w…",

          "description": "lastday, 失业啦\n公司年前通知我合同到期不续签，今天是我的 lastday ，我也失业啦～\n在这期间，经过深思熟虑，我决定开启自己的 PlanB ，尝试做所谓的自由职业、独立开发者。今天下午办理完离职相关手续后，回到家开始计划起了我后续规划。\n其实提到“自由职业“、“独立开发“这两个词我是不太喜欢的，在没有获得稳定收入前，说白了其实就是没工作的无业人员。但是很多人贴上这两个标签后能蹭到不错的热度获取流量，因此在下也给自己贴上了这两个标签。\n使用企业微信搭建自由职业独立开发工作体系\n在飞书和企业微信之间考虑，主要是一方面想用他们的文档功能记录一些工作内容以便整理发布到我的个人博客，另一方面是想通过它们来管理自己，让自己在独立开发前期能保持正常的工作节奏。\n最近这份工作使用的是飞书，感觉文档功能还不错。以前在腾讯用过企业微信，离职以后就不知道它现在长什么样了，好奇现在有些什么功能。重新装上企业微信，研究了一下相关功能，感觉满足我的需求，再加上我在服务里发邮件是用的腾讯的企业邮箱，所以就它了。（下面的内容看起来像是企业微信的广告，但并不是。）\n无法使用微信群入群欢迎语\n因为我有个用户交流微信群，想研究了一下普通微信群是否可以通过企业微信机器人自动发送新人入群欢迎语。万万没想到把企业号拉进群后它自动成为群主然后把我自己的微信（群主）移出了群聊，一度相当尴尬。要设置自动欢迎语必须要把微信群标记为客户群，但是提示不支持标记，可能是我没有认证企业账号的原因，没有继续深入研究，放弃了。\n我用到的功能\n用到的功能除了文档以外，还有工作台里面的汇报和人事助手。\n汇报用来写日报，记录一天都做了些什么。\n\n人事助手里有个工资条，我想试试用它来记录自己的每月收入。\n\n还有就是手机 APP 上有个打卡功能，想和正常上班一样早晚打卡，通过打卡我觉得可能会让自己更加规律，保持节奏。\n我创建的文档\n建了几个文档分别是：日报、工资条、项目管理。\n\n后续打算在个人博客更新自己的自由职业/独立开发的动态，可能是周更，也可能是月更，看忙闲程度吧。日报用于记录当日工作内容，以便整理发布到个人博客，写这个其实挺耗时的，不过也算是营销自己的工作的一部分。\n工资条模板里面我设置了自己现在的收入来源，不管多少，有过几毛钱也罢，只要到账过的都列上去了（至少证明了这是一种可以继续探索的模式），后续每月月底更新一下。\n项目管理我把自己接下来的工作计划都大概列出来了，并给自己排了个理想的期（每天至少 8 小时，不包揽家务的情况下），已经排到 6 月 27 号了。同时列了一些网站的日常维护和运营工作，以及一些待开发的新功能点记录和其他想法的备忘。\n\n现在迫切想做和需要做的是开发小程序，但是因为我完全 0 基础，需要边学边做，所以之前一直拖延没有开始。\n小程序具体要做些什么暂且先不透露了，因为有一些顾虑，我还没想好到底应不应该像其他独立开发者一样完全地 build in public ，这些问题后续再写。\n结语\n下午回到差不多 5 点左右，一直搞到现在，效率有待提高。今天就先到这里，祝大家生活愉快。",

          "description": "我父亲是一个没什么主见的人，他经常和一位同村的长辈聊天。这个长辈挺成功的，在县城里做过小官。他帮我奶奶办过一个教师保险(我奶奶不是教师)，领退休金，大概总共领了十几二十万，算对我们家有恩。我奶奶在这个长辈被抓的时候借钱给他，后来他出来了。\n我父亲有啥话都和他说。这个长辈说话建议啥的对我很不客气，并且很会煽动人的情绪。我父亲被他影响很大。我也和他聊过几次。他说过：1. 找个老婆有那么难吗？！我现在随时都可以约一个出来你信吗？他 60 多了 2. 你平时要主动点，大胆点，不要怕羞。3. 你多约约人家出来！别人要求很高吗？！难道她要香港的？！（男朋友）我说：有可能哦。4. 不是人家不好，多想想自己的原因，多练练口才。是你沟女不行，是你自己不够优秀！别人怎么能找到，比你差的都有人找两三个老婆。\n我父亲会对我说，xx 伯说你在北京那么远，有可能会嫁出去啵。回广东吧！（讽刺我会给别人当上门女婿）。\n我爸这个人内向，口才不好，情商特别低，但脾气特别暴躁。特别是对爷爷，对奶奶。奶奶特别强势压制父亲特别厉害，父亲是独子，看得出来奶奶很爱父亲，父亲也很爱奶奶，同时父亲也恨奶奶，她太强势了。爷爷年轻的时候不怎么管家里，爷爷以前当兵的在县城有单位。奶奶一个人在家带 4 个孩子，爷爷不怎么管。\n父亲的工作很辛苦，做大理石的。23 年一线工人，也修点电路，电动机。大理石要切割（粉尘特别多），噪音，搬动。哎～ 20 多年干苦力活太辛苦了\n我父亲他特别好面子，他以为他在村里形象挺好的，别人都挺尊敬他。其实他的形象挺差的。有一次父亲去赌，我母亲在家哭，母亲也是挺犟脾气的，在家越想越憋屈（父亲每次赌母亲就说自己的辛苦钱去送给别人），在生闷气。后来忍不了直接去摔麻将。过年期间全村人都知道了。\n后来我分析，为什么父亲过年会想去赌。他其实挺孤独的挺苦的，经常 11 点半多,12 点才睡，他焦虑孤独睡不着阿。平时没什么朋友聊天。好不容易过年，儿时的玩伴都回来了，当然要去玩了，放松一下，和别人聊聊天，社交一下。重要的是别人会说好听的话，他会想听到他想听的话。毕竟财神爷送钱谁不喜欢。还有有些别人讽刺他的话他也听不懂以为别人夸他呢。还挺开心的。\n有一次我父亲去喝完别人喜酒。别人说：一哥张家就差你一个了啵，儿子啥时候结婚阿？你儿子有没有聊女朋友？再不结婚就迟了哟！我父亲听了这些话就很慌，是天塌下来的那种。他最听不了这些话，每次慌了就打电话过来训我，怪我没用给他丢脸。村里有的人会故意刺激他，他都是照单全收，他每次都焦虑得要死，就打电话训我。训得多了，他说：和我说话你老是嗯嗯嗯的，会不会说话！你和女孩子也是这样说话的是吧！那把嘴能不能学好点得不得！学精明点得不得！整天脑子里面是什么！装的是水吗！整天没精神的样子学阳光点会死阿！整个番薯一样！你有脑的吗！（以前语气都是像喊贼那么大声）。你那双眼看上天，眼睛长在头顶！别那么清高得不得！别人一层楼的都取了二，三个了！\n以前他说到难听的话我忍着，不和他争辩，毕竟他是父亲。后来我回击了，是狠狠的回击了。他骂我：脑子是不是有问题！你是男人吗！有卵蛋吗！你那方面是不是有问题！有空去医院看看吧！我回应也很激烈！那一次我们歇斯底里！\n后来我们很久没有说话。前不久我们又大吵一架，歇斯底里的那种！\n在我的世界观里，对于讽刺自己的人（例如亲戚），占自己便宜的人（例如同事叫帮带早餐不给钱），同属岗位的同事挖坑。这些人 1.：远离。2.：警戒不要太给面子。3.敌人。现在选项 1 行不通。不是选项 3 毕竟是父亲。现在是选项 2 ，不给面子，能过过不过拉到，少接触，少聊天，有事帮，无事不接触。过年回家聚聚，能好好说话就聊。以前我老实在了，心想他是父亲要尊重他让他讲话，傻傻的听他训话，结果他越训越起劲，越难听，侮辱人。现在如果说话风向不对赶紧逃离，找借口挂电话。老了养他。\n最后想听听大家的建议。以后我该怎么办，怎么和父亲相处",

          "description": "这里有一些我对于 samba 的一些不满，简单概括就是文件路径太长 samba 不支持，导致文件名可用字符很短。结论下来 SMB 服务器还是得 Windows 。\nWindows 下有存储空间，但是这个东西风评不是很好，文档也不全。隔壁 LTT 也抛弃了使用这东西来组磁盘阵列。\n于是，先大概列出组磁盘阵列要有的功能：\n一定程度内，硬盘故障不会导致数据丢失\n允许添加任意大小的磁盘进行扩容\n冗余级别可以自行选择\n然后就发现了 SnapRAID 。一个跨平台的文件“备份”方案。使用效果和 Unraid 类似，不是传统的 RAID ，但是也能提供一定程度冗余。\nSnapRAID 运行在文件系统之后，而不是组了 RAID 之后再运行文件系统。于是这东西就能跨平台。\n目前打算是这样整：\nPVE -> Windows Server -> SnapRAID -> DrivePool -> SSD Cache -> SMB\n\nDrivePool 可以替换成 RClone Union + WinFSP ，但是这样估计太怪了。\n然后就是 SSD 缓冲的设计，可以是只缓冲 SMB 写，也可以是缓存每个硬盘。估计 PrimoCache 可以完成。\nOVM 是有 SnapRAID 插件，配合 MergerFS 就能实现以上功能。但是我不要 Samba ，或者 OVM 开 NFS 然后 Windows 提供 SMB ？\n最后就是 SnapRAID 的配置\n校验数据和 Unraid 一样，校验数据的硬盘必须是最大容量的硬盘。校验数据是普通的文件，于是允许校验盘是多个硬盘组成，但是实际上使用会不会有问题。\nSnapRAID 需要手动同步。虽然跑一次影响不大，但也是要手动（或定时，或事件触发）跑一次。\n关于大量小文件的友好程度。\n想听听 dalao 们有什么看法。",

          "description": "概念\n首先给出一段由 ChatGPT 给出的简短的 AOP 概念：\nAOP 是一种编程方法，用来将在程序中多处重复出现的代码（比如日志、权限控制）从主要业务逻辑中抽取出来，提高代码的模块化和可维护性。\n抽取后的代码会在原始的业务逻辑代码中特定的位置执行，这些位置由切点（ Pointcut ）定义。通常会在方法执行前、执行后、抛出异常时等特定点执行抽取出的代码，这些点被称为连接点（ Join Point ）。\n概述\n在 C 语言中，编译器所提供的编译期和执行期的能力相较于 java 或者其他语言来说会弱一些，这也许就是可能很少听到在 C 语言中搞面向切面编程的原因之一吧。\n从上面的概念上来看，AOP 一般是在一些函数（或类方法）执行前后做一些额外处理，例如调用前增加一些权限控制，调用后增加一些日志记录。从这些行为上来说，任何语言其实都可以做到。我们可以简单的在一个函数的开始加一段逻辑或调用某个函数来实现权限验证，在函数返回前调用某个函数添加日志等等。类似如下代码：\nvoid foo(void)\n{\n  if (!verify_identity())\n    return;\n\n  //...\n  \n  log(\"end\");\n}\n\n但很显然，这么做会在程序的很多个函数中添加很多重复的代码（例如本例的verify_identity和log），以至于代码变得比较臃肿。\n那么有没有什么办法来瘦身呢？\n这就是 AOP 擅长的领域了。\n写在示例之前\nC 语言编译器没有提供很完整的 AOP 支持，因此我们需要自行手动实现，或者使用一些现有的库来实现。\n本文将使用开源 C 语言库 Melon 的函数模板来实现上面的效果。\n在 Melon 提供的函数模板组件中，实现了若干宏函数，这些宏函数都是用来定义不同类型的函数的。这些用宏来定义的函数和我们原生 C 语言中的函数的区别，简单来说就是，在我们…",

          "description": "周末想用最近学的 Rust 来练手一下，于是参考一个很古老的 C 语言实现的端口敲门程序 knock，用 Rust 实现了一个版本。\n\nPort Knocking 是一种网络安全技术，通过对服务器上的一系列预定义端口进行特定顺序的“敲门”(即发送数据包)来触发服务器上的一种反应，通常是打开一个原本关闭的端口，从而允许发起敲门序列的客户端建立连接。这种方法的优点在于，对外界而言，受保护的服务端口在没有接收到正确的敲门序列之前都是不可见的，从而增加了系统的安全性。\n这个工具分为客户端和服务器端两部分：\n服务器端 (knockd): 在服务器上运行，负责监听预设的一系列端口上的敲门尝试。当它检测到来自同一 IP 的特定序列时，会执行配置文件中定义的命令，如修改防火墙规则来允许来自该 IP 的连接。\n客户端 (knock-cli): 用于发起敲门序列。用户可以通过客户端配置文件指定目标服务器地址和敲门的端口序列。执行敲门动作后，如果服务器端正确识别了敲门序列，客户端的 IP 地址将被允许访问原本隐藏或受限的服务。\n项目地址： https://github.com/TimothyYe/knock\n欢迎 Star 和贡献 Pull Request.",

These lanterns are interactive, changing colors and patterns in response to the movements of passersby, blending traditional artistry with modern technology.\n![DALLE3]( https://img.artiversehub.ai/2024/02/23/a57125ba73d445949787340168219cbc.webp)\nPrompt: A city square with lanterns hanging in the sky. These lanterns are interactive, changing colors and patterns in response to the movements of passersby.\n![LEONARDO.AI]( https://img.artiversehub.ai/2024/02/23/c15f1f8ea4164244baaa61a36ff47bdf.jpg)\n新产品可能存在一些不太稳定的问题，我们也在持续优化中，新用户会赠送免费体验代币，欢迎大家体验，链接地址： https://aiimagegenerator.artiversehub.ai",

          "description": "这边年还没过完，OpenAI 就发布了文生视频大模型 Sora 。\n只需要输入一段文本，Sora 就可以生成长达 60 秒的高质量视频。\n1. Sora 介绍\n作为 OpenAI 首个文生视频模型，Sora 出道即王炸，生成的视频展现出了高级的摄影艺术、复杂的多角度镜头、逼真的情绪捕捉以及精确的物理模拟。毫无疑问，Sora 将对短视频、广告视频、动画短片、特效影视等视频行业产生巨大影响。\nSora 产品主页： https://openai.com/sora\nSora 技术报告： https://openai.com/research/video-generation-models-as-world-simulators\n从文本生成模型 GPT ，到文生图模型 DALL·E ，再到文生视频模型 Sora ，OpenAI 的技术迭代不禁让人感慨：\n或许，能打败 OpenAI 的只有 OpenAI 吧。\n目前，OpenAI 并没有开放 Sora 使用。不过，参考之前文生图模型 DALL·E 的经验，Sora 肯定只会开放给 ChatGPT Plus 用户使用。如果需要升级 ChatGPT Plus ，可以参考这篇文章：一分钟升级 ChatGPT Plus 教程。\n2. Sora 文生视频案例\nSora 不仅能够在视频主体暂时离开镜头时保持故事线的流畅，还能确保视频内容的真实性和逻辑性，不让任何细节显得突兀或者不自然。下面是 OpenAI 官方给出的案例：\nPrompt: A stylish woman walks down a Tokyo street filled with warm glowing neon and animated city signage.

          "description": "国行版红米 K70 丐版，作为副机用了两个半月，写写使用感受。\n喜欢的地方\n主要是硬件性价比高\n便宜：上代旗舰 CPU 只要 2500 元，还要啥自行车。（阅读下文时请记住这点😂）\n性能强：上代旗舰跑绝大部分应用都没问题，而且 8gen2 没啥温控之类的硬伤。\n拍摄顺畅：相机普通模式连按快门很顺畅，没有感觉到卡顿。\n屏幕不错：基本的 HDR 视觉效果很好。阳光下激发亮度比较清晰。\n应用权限管理精细：权限管理比原生安卓（不加装模块的情况下）精细多了，限制后台应用以及防止全家桶互相唤醒也比原生系统激进得多，适合国内应用环境。\n晴雪比较好看：假如是光面，塑料感会很强。晴雪加了纹理后，视觉上比塑料好多了，不过不如磨砂玻璃。（虽然号称绒面质感玻璃，但我怎么看都像塑料...）\n不喜欢的地方\n好像几乎都是 HyperOS 的细节吐槽\n基本功能\n音量控制较差：一格太轻，两格太吵。音质渣。\n振动比较弱：这个看个人偏好，我是觉得太弱了，放口袋里几乎感觉不到。\n冬天指纹解锁成功率低：贴了钢化膜的情况下，在冬天又冷又干的环境，屏下光学指纹解锁成功率明显降低。暖一些、湿度正常的时候，指纹解锁没什么问题。\n主题界面\n桌面文件夹没有小四宫格：很奇怪，只有占 1×1 的小九宫格和占 2×2 的大四宫格、大九宫格，但没有占 1×1 的小四宫格，这就导致 3-4 个图标时非常尴尬。\n桌面布局只有 4×6, 5×6, 4×7 ，不知道为什么没有 5×7 。\n第三方应用无法分别设置桌面和锁屏壁纸：第三方相册应用只能同时设置桌面和锁屏壁纸，如果要设置不同图片则需要安装小米相册。\n短信通知下划会变小窗：新短信弹出的横幅通知，下划会变成独立小窗，我不太喜欢，但无法设置不显示小窗。\n刘海不平衡：K70 明明挺宽的，但摄像头左侧最多只能显示 3 个图标，空空荡荡。与此同时，摄像头右侧显示一堆图标，非常拥挤。\n系统及应用\n杀后台连 VPN 都不例外：从后台应用列表划走应用就强制结束运行，哪怕把 VPN 应用的省电策略设置为不限制也没用。用通知栏快捷开关是可以不出现在后台应用列表里，不过打开应用界面操作就出现在后台应用列表里了。但搞笑的是，有时从后台同时划走多个应用，VPN 应用有概率继续在后台运行。\n截图只能存 JPG：系统自带截图应用默认只能保存为 JPG 格式，无法保存为无损的 PNG 格式，没有设置选项。以前 MIUI 可以用 adb 禁用截图应用来 fallback 到原生系统截图功能，现在尝试 adb 禁用会提示系统应用无法禁用。\n下载管理烦人：下载管理 app 的通知无法关闭，下载完成有时会带一句“未启用迅雷加速”打广告。另外绿色的图标又丑又显眼。\n安全服务烦人：安全服务 app 的部分通知无法关闭，虽然安全类强制提示可以理解，但“垃圾清理”、“电池与省电的一般通知”也不能关闭就比较烦。另外绿色盾牌图标又丑又显眼。\nandroid/app 目录无法授权访问：正常来说应用访问 android/app 目录需要单独授予访问权限，但 Solid Explorer 文件管理器申请授权时，提示“为了保护您的隐私，请选择其他文件夹”，无法授权。\n默认应用商店无法更改：虽然安装 Google Play 很简单，但无法替换默认的小米商店，这就导致个别 Play 版应用调起内购时却调起小米商店，然后提示出错无法内购。\n涉及底层的应用可能不兼容：有些应用比如 Island(炼妖壶)会克隆不了工作资料分身，即使在开发者选项关了系统优化也不成功，感觉是调用应用包管理组件的问题。最后通过 adb 安装了工作资料应用。\n广告多：默认配置下广告真是铺天盖地，想得到想不到的地方都会出现广告，开关则散落在各处，要一个个去设置关闭，考验耐心和搜索能力。\n总结\n非常适合作为副机专门装国内应用。虽然上面吐槽了一大堆，但它便宜啊......",

          "description": "名字: Mindr\n开发者 / 团队: Florian Vates\n平台: iOS, iPadOS, Android 正在开发中\n请简要介绍下这款产品\n有没有发现自己总是不断推迟待办事项的通知？\nMindr 以一种全新的方法来解决这个问题，它直观的界面设计将待办事项的进度直接显示在桌面上，就像查看 Apple 的电池小组件一样，你只需要轻松一瞥便能知道剩余时间。\n\n给 Mindr 一个机会，它的效果会让你大吃一惊！\n哪个瞬间让你决定开发这款产品？\n在我意识到自己总是无限期推迟一些不会带来严重后果的任务，并且开始失去对它们逾期时间的跟踪时，忽然脑中灵光一闪——我发现传统的通知提醒对这类任务并不奏效，于是我决定打造一个更有效的解决方案。\n相比于同类产品，你觉得它有什么特别之处？\n大多数待办事项 App 都是在任务到期时提醒你，让你立刻去完成，但往往那并非是完成任务的最佳时机。与之不同，Mindr 采用视觉进度显示，让你对任务是否逾期以及逾期时长一目了然，从而激发你的紧迫感。\n你尝试过哪些渠道推广它？过程中有什么收获吗？\n目前我们主要通过公开产品构建的过程（ Build in Public ）进行推广，并与多家欣赏我们这种创新方式的科技媒体合作，他们对于我们在这个竞争激励的市场带来的新思路表示赞赏，并对 Mindr 进行了报道。\n发布这款产品至今，有哪些反馈让你印象深刻？\n让我感到非常开心的是，许多患有多动症（ ADHD ）的用户告诉我，这款 App 极大地帮助他们提高了对任务的专注度。因为他们能够持续地看到这些任务，并感受到紧迫感。看到我的产品能帮助他们解决最头痛的问题，真的让我感到欣慰。\n你是如何获取灵感，验证它的可行性，并投入开发和设计的？\n我有一份全职工作，还需要照顾家庭以及在教堂做义工，因此我的时间非常有限，就更不用说业余爱好了。虽然如此，我还是努力每天至少挤出一个小时来处理副业项目（ Side Projects ）。\n时间的宝贵让我必须高效地利用每一分钟，在 App 开发方面的经验帮助我在编程上节省了不少时间，因此优先级划分成为我工作的重点。我用 Sorted 3 快速记下突然冒出的任务和想法，之后再进行整理和优先排序。\n但我通常对此并不会过于严格，毕竟我还是想享受创作的乐趣。如果我暂时不想做某件事，我会根据实际情况进行调整。在广告公司超过 9 年的工作经验，让我学会了如何有效地区分轻重缓急。\n因此，我只开发那些能解决我个人问题的 App ，这也是我对市场验证不太苛刻的原因，因为这些 App 本来就是为了我自己而制作的。与此同时，这也让我对完成和完善这些 App 充满动力，这是一个意想不到的好处。\n在设计方面，我有自己坚持的风格，并尝试让它适用于其他 App 。我偶尔也会从 Dribbble 上寻找灵感，作为一名有近 10 年经验的 iOS 开发者，启动新项目对我来说已经驾轻就熟。\n有哪些产品你觉得应该被更多用户知道？\n除了前面提到的 Sorted 3 外，还有一个可能不太为人所知的 App 是 Rotato，我用它来制作应用功能的动画演示。另一个值得一提的是 Wishkit，它能够帮助收集用户的功能需求，这对于确定产品的优先级非常有帮助。虽然我已经构建了自己的一套系统，但对于那些不想自己动手的人来说，使用像 Wishkit 这样的服务是一个不错的选择。\n介绍一下你自己，以来未来的计划。\n我是一名全职爸爸，同时也是一家广告公司的全职软件开发人员，热衷于创造能以有趣且美好的方式改善人们生活的副业项目（ Side Projects ）。\n我之前开发的项目还包括一款记账 App MonAi，它利用 AI 将语音输入转变为交易记录，帮助用户以最简单的方式跟踪开支。\n未来，我计划推出更多的应用和服务，希望有一天能将此作为我的主要收入来源。\n关于 Apptisan\nApptisan 是 Application 与 Artisan 的组合词，意为「与应用背后的工匠交流」。\n每一期我会与来自不同地方的创作者交流，希望通过我们的对话来向更多的用户介绍有趣的产品。\n如果你倾向于英文阅读，欢迎通过 Substack 订阅。如果你想要自荐产品，请填写该 表格，我会尽快与你取得联系。",

          "description": "大家好，有些工作上的事情想咨询下大家。\n我毕业工作 4.5 年，第一家 2 年，第二家 2 年，第三家半年多\n其中第二家和第三家都是大厂\n我是北方人，在北京工作 4 年，现在第三家公司在广东。目前对于工作还有环境都感觉到不舒服，不知道如何抉择。\n先说工作，目前是结构是导师带着全组干活，组长负责给大家评估，但是组长基本属于天天玩，都是导师掌握全部话语权。\n（ 1 ）这个导师真的很难相处，经常分一些他的杂活给我，都是不能体现我的产出的。领导分给他的活，数据分析，经常让我来替他做。\n（ 2 ）非常 push ，喜欢上午不来，下午来上班坐到 11-12 点，我是上午 10 点就到公司。然后经常晚上拉会对齐，布置任务，包括周五也会分一堆要干的，说周一来看结果。作为底下的人，很累\n（ 3 ）一旦有任何的地方他不满意，就会在周会上抨击你，当着全组和组长的面，说你的不是。\n这半年来，整的我非常抑郁，上班都要难受好久，觉得生怕再惹得导师不高兴，心里压力巨大。虽然只比我大一岁，但是给人感觉非常难受，难相处。喜欢人身攻击，只要和他想法不一致，直接就上头，脖子红，开始攻击人。而且一边贬低你，还要看能不能让组长听见。\n之前组里得老同事基本只有 1 哥 8 年的老油条还在，其他都是近半年新招聘的。也就是上一波人全走了\n生活方面，南方湿热天气，也还好，主要离家太远，回家太不方便，参考考试成本太高。年纪大了，想要找对象结婚，距离太远也是个阻碍。\n综上，非常想离职，但是又怕简历花了，毕竟如果目前两家大厂的经历都完成的话，以后纸面上看起来简历还是更好一些。想听下大家的意见，感觉如果不走，今年会非常难熬。",

          "description": "收到 poe 发的邮件\nHi Creators,\n\nWe’ve heard your feedback and we’re excited to share important product updates and tips for our creator monetization program designed to boost your earning potential:\n\nDoubled Subscription earnings: For every user who becomes a subscriber through your bot, you’ll receive $20 per monthly and $100 per annual subscription, effective immediately.\nControl your paywall: When a user subscribes to Poe after seeing your paywall, you earn. Yet most creators haven’t turned on paywall settings, so users only see a paywall after using up all their daily points.\nHow to set your paywall: From your public bot list, click into each bot, go to ‘Edit bot’ in ‘...’ on the bot details, and toggle on the “Maximum daily message limit”. We recommend starting with 10 messages per day, and adjusting up or down. Consider how many messages it will take to engage the user before displaying the paywall so they’re most likely to subscribe.\nShare to earn: As always, sharing your bots with your personal network and across social media goes a long way in helping drive engagement and increasing your chances to earn. Poe also has an official Discord channel specifically to highlight your amazing creations: #showcase.\nPer-message earnings coming soon: With the recent addition of compute points, we’re closer to introducing a way to earn from each message your bot sends in response to a user. We will share more details soon.\n\nAs the heartbeat of the Poe community, we’re proud to support and reward creators like you for creating and sharing such a diverse mix of bots for users to engage with.",

          "description": "前几天在优衣库买了条裤子，小了，于是确定换货，被告知可以门店换货。提前打电话问门店库存，已经提前告知是网络购买，以及货号，查了相应的库存，告诉我直接到店就可以更换。\n第二天，带着商品和退货单到店，同款没这个色了，想要更换相同款式不同颜色尺码的，店员告知我网上价格和线下不一样，换货需要补足差价，不然无法提供换货。\n无法认同这个规则，联系淘宝官方旗舰店客服，期间问了我一堆奇奇怪怪的问题，比如原因是什么（我回答说店员告知需要补差价），现在店里什么价格等等，最后升级专员处理，专员打电话到店里，店员告诉他可以操作，也可以成功，但是他拒绝操作。最后店员告诉我他们店里卖 249 ，你 99 买的，要是换给你他们就亏了。\n于是我持续和淘宝客服沟通，客服一开始说他们显示已经换货成功了，我告知他们店员拒绝为我换货。然后又是继续处理，期间我一直在询问需要多少时间，因为在已经在门店等待已经一个多小时了，客服就是扯皮说需要时间，不说需要处理多久，导致我一直没有离开门店。\n在等待约半小时后，这个时候我已经等待接近 2 个小时了，客服依然无法给我准行，无奈，我只能先行离开。又过了 40 分钟，客服这个时候只会反复重复他们的退换货条款。\n换货仅支持更换同款同价的不同颜色或尺码的商品，不支持更换不同款号的商品。若购买了同款号仅部分颜色降价销售的商品，换货时只能更换同款号同价格的商品。\n在我反复追问下，客服告知我价格要以商品的售卖金额为准，说时候，这句话也是又歧义的，吊牌价是商品的售卖价格，那降价后的价格也是商品售卖价格啊。我无奈，只能转投诉，不过他们只会说什么抱歉，记录，我想根本一点屁用没有。\n如果要线上线下价格一致才可以门店换货，那么这个功能一点吊用没有。更加离谱的是，没有人会提前告知你这个事情，你到了门店才发现换货还需要补差价，而你一点办法没有。如果需要线上线下价格一致才允许换货，那么你至少应该提醒说明，因为这个条件实际上很难保证。\n我比较倾向于这家门店是有问题的，如果不满足 [仅支持更换同款同价的不同颜色或尺码的商品] ，那么应该直接拒绝我的换货申请，而不是让我补差价，如果是 [若购买了同款号仅部分颜色降价销售的商品，换货时只能更换同款号同价格的商品。] ，那我还只能认了，但我认为我不属于这种情况，线上降价是全颜色的，他们也很少有这种部分颜色降价的促销，而且门店一直说原因是价格不一致，而不是颜色问题。\n最后，大家有什么投诉或者举报的渠道么，浪费了我接近 3 小时就这个结果。\n因为非常奇怪，要么客服业务不熟练，根本不了解这个换货政策，导致一直在处理，让我等待长达 2 个多小时，要么客服就是恶心下我，明知我不满足换货条件，依然假装在处理，拖延我。",

          "description": "Reqable正式发布后这大半年的真实感受，就是推广实在是太难了，尤其是海外推广。国内市场，由于语言文化没有隔阂，相对来说好一点，至少写一些技术文章还有受众。海外市场，尝试了 Twitter 和 ProductHunt 等，完全没有流量。如果有资金，打广告，找运营团队，都还好说，但是对于独立开发者来讲，这个成本难以接受。如果专职运营，一个人精力有限，产品的功能上新和迭代必然要受到大幅影响。\n针对这个困局，我的计划是采用半开源的方式，试试效果。这里的半开源，包括两大方面：\n模块开源。\n云服务开源。\nReqable 本身是开发人员工具，开源可以给项目带来一些曝光和流量，同时也能给社区做贡献，共同成长，一举两得。\n1. 模块开源\n开源 Reqable 项目中的重要模块，很多都是 Flutter 生态中目前的痛点，也是我花了很大精力去完成的，这部分开源的模块会随着 Reqable 项目一起迭代和成长。只要 Reqable 项目还活着，这些仓库都会持续维护和迭代下去。\nReqable 采用了组件化开发，很多模块都是以单独仓库的形式存在，下面是项目全部的组成部分。\n\n第一批已经开源的有三个模块：\n代码编辑器\n文本高亮\npython 脚本框架\n后续我会抽时间整理下其他模块的代码和编写文档，助力 Flutter 生态越来越好！\n1.1 代码编辑器\n项目地址： https://github.com/reqable/re-editor\nRe-Editor是一个强大的轻量级文本和代码编辑器组件，既可以作为一个简单多行文本输入组件，也可以作为一个具备基本功能的代码编辑器。\n\nRe-Editor采用自绘而不是控件组装的方案，因此具备很高的性能，支持大文件编辑。Re-Editor解决了 Flutter 官方的TextField组件的很多痛点问题，同时还具备下面这些特性：\n横向和纵向双向滚动。\n文本语法高亮。\n内容折叠和展开。\n输入提示和自动补全。\n搜索替换功能。\n自定义上下文菜单。\n快捷键支持。\n大文本显示和编辑。\n显示行号和焦点行。\n智能输入。\n1.2 文本高亮\n项目地址： https://github.com/reqable/re-highlight\nRe-Highlight是一个强大的文本语法高亮库，可以将一个文本自动语法高亮，只需要定义好一个语法规则。当然，Re-Highlight已经内置了几十种编程语言的语法高亮规则，几行代码即可实现代码语法高亮。\n\nRe-Highlight的实现代码全部由Dart语言编写，翻译自知名的highlightjs项目，实现思路和灵感则来自于highlight.dart项目（已停止更新维护）。Re-Highlight已同步highlightjs当前的最新版本 v11.9.0 ，并验证通过全部的测试用例，应该是目前 Flutter 生态里最强大的文本语法高亮库。\n1.3 python 脚本框架\n项目地址： https://github.com/reqable/python-scripting-api\nReqable 目前使用的 Python 脚本框架，基本都是 Python 代码，对 Flutter 社区的贡献倒不大，所以不多介绍，熟悉 Python 的可以看看。\n2. 云服务开源\n目前几乎所有的 API 相关软件都是靠云服务收费，我也这么想过，但是还是放弃了。我觉得 Reqable 需要做一些改变，将云服务完全开源，主要考虑下面几点：\n数据安全。几乎所有上规模的企业都注重数据安全，将非常重要的 API 数据放到第三方服务器是不现实的，所以很多竞品都是靠私有部署来收费。但是很多小公司或者个人，根本付不起私有部署的成本。所以，我的想法是反其道而行之，云服务免费，并支持自由部署，用户只需要一台服务器。\n技术栈。Reqable 项目目前只有我一个人在开发，除了开发客户端，还要做网站开发、运营推广、运维、客服等等，真的忙不过来。而且，我可以拍胸脯说我精通客户端，这个没问题，但是让我说精通服务端，那就真扯淡了。\n关于云服务项目，还在计划和筹备中，目前暂定的是Levi大佬会和我一起开发，当然也是由 Levi 主导，这里要感谢 Levi 的支持。\n项目地址： https://github.com/reqable/restapi-cloud-server\n结语\n今年再接再厉，让 Reqable 随着社区一起成长吧！",

          "description": "Reqable正式发布后这大半年的真实感受，就是推广实在是太难了，尤其是海外推广。国内市场，由于语言文化没有隔阂，相对来说好一点，至少写一些技术文章还有受众。海外市场，尝试了 Twitter 和 ProductHunt 等，完全没有流量。如果有资金，打广告，找运营团队，都还好说，但是对于独立开发者来讲，这个成本难以接受。如果专职运营，一个人精力有限，产品的功能上新和迭代必然要受到大幅影响。\n针对这个困局，我的计划是采用半开源的方式，试试效果。这里的半开源，包括两大方面：\n模块开源。\n云服务开源。\nReqable 本身是开发人员工具，开源可以给项目带来一些曝光和流量，同时也能给社区做贡献，共同成长，一举两得。\n1. 模块开源\n开源 Reqable 项目中的重要模块，很多都是 Flutter 生态中目前的痛点，也是我花了很大精力去完成的，这部分开源的模块会随着 Reqable 项目一起迭代和成长。只要 Reqable 项目还活着，这些仓库都会持续维护和迭代下去。\nReqable 采用了组件化开发，很多模块都是以单独仓库的形式存在，下面是项目全部的组成部分。\n\n第一批已经开源的有三个模块：\n代码编辑器\n文本高亮\npython 脚本框架\n后续我会抽时间整理下其他模块的代码和编写文档，助力 Flutter 生态越来越好！\n1.1 代码编辑器\n项目地址： https://github.com/reqable/re-editor\nRe-Editor是一个强大的轻量级文本和代码编辑器组件，既可以作为一个简单多行文本输入组件，也可以作为一个具备基本功能的代码编辑器。\n\nRe-Editor采用自绘而不是控件组装的方案，因此具备很高的性能，支持大文件编辑。Re-Editor解决了 Flutter 官方的TextField组件的很多痛点问题，同时还具备下面这些特性：\n横向和纵向双向滚动。\n文本语法高亮。\n内容折叠和展开。\n输入提示和自动补全。\n搜索替换功能。\n自定义上下文菜单。\n快捷键支持。\n大文本显示和编辑。\n显示行号和焦点行。\n智能输入。\n1.2 文本高亮\n项目地址： https://github.com/reqable/re-highlight\nRe-Highlight是一个强大的文本语法高亮库，可以将一个文本自动语法高亮，只需要定义好一个语法规则。当然，Re-Highlight已经内置了几十种编程语言的语法高亮规则，几行代码即可实现代码语法高亮。\n\nRe-Highlight的实现代码全部由Dart语言编写，翻译自知名的highlightjs项目，实现思路和灵感则来自于highlight.dart项目（已停止更新维护）。Re-Highlight已同步highlightjs当前的最新版本 v11.9.0 ，并验证通过全部的测试用例，应该是目前 Flutter 生态里最强大的文本语法高亮库。\n1.3 python 脚本框架\n项目地址： https://github.com/reqable/python-scripting-api\nReqable 目前使用的 Python 脚本框架，基本都是 Python 代码，对 Flutter 社区的贡献倒不大，所以不多介绍，熟悉 Python 的可以看看。\n2. 云服务开源\n目前几乎所有的 API 相关软件都是靠云服务收费，我也这么想过，但是还是放弃了。我觉得 Reqable 需要做一些改变，将云服务完全开源，主要考虑下面几点：\n数据安全。几乎所有上规模的企业都注重数据安全，将非常重要的 API 数据放到第三方服务器是不现实的，所以很多竞品都是靠私有部署来收费。但是很多小公司或者个人，根本付不起私有部署的成本。所以，我的想法是反其道而行之，云服务免费，并支持自由部署，用户只需要一台服务器。\n技术栈。Reqable 项目目前只有我一个人在开发，除了开发客户端，还要做网站开发、运营推广、运维、客服等等，真的忙不过来。而且，我可以拍胸脯说我精通客户端，这个没问题，但是让我说精通服务端，那就真扯淡了。\n关于云服务项目，还在计划和筹备中，目前暂定的是Levi大佬会和我一起开发，当然也是由 Levi 主导，这里要感谢 Levi 的支持。\n项目地址： https://github.com/reqable/restapi-cloud-server\n结语\n今年再接再厉，让 Reqable 随着社区一起成长吧！",

          "description": "情况\n今年春节在家里放了一个 armbian 盒子(Ubuntu)，接入的移动宽带；在上海的电脑是 Windows ，接入的联通宽带。两台机器都安装了 ZeroTier 和 TailScale （以下简称 ZT 和 TS ）。\n春节结束返回上海以后发现 ZeroTier 和 TailScale 都能 ping 通 armbian ，但是 ssh 均无法连接。ping 延时都在 50ms 左右，说明都是直连。经过一番搜索，把目光投向了 MTU 。通过在 Windows 下执行ping x.x.x.x -l 1472 -f指令（ x.x.x.x 是组网工具分配的 IP ），并逐步缩小 ICMP 数据大小，发现 ZT 网络内的上限是 1166 ，TS 的上限是 1252 。算上 28 字节的 ICMP 头，即 ZT 的最大 MTU 为 1194 ，TS 的为 1280\n执行netsh interface ipv4 show subinterfaces查看各个网卡的 MTU ，发现电脑上 ZT 配置的 MTU 是惊人的 2800 ，TS 的为 1280 。修改 ZT 网卡的 MTU 为 1194 后能使用 ZT 网内的 IP 地址连上 ssh ，测试了一个网页服务也正常访问。但是 TS 这边，MTU 已经是正确的了，仍然无法 ssh 连接。\n疑惑\n我不是科班背景也不熟悉网络这块的内容，请教一下专业的朋友：\n我理解，当数据来到 ZeroTier 的网卡时，还要在 ZeroTier 网络内拆包然后借助真实的网卡发送出去，这种情况下 2800 的 MTU 似乎也并无不可。但是实际表现来看稍大的 MTU 网络就不能工作，为什么会有这样的表现？\nTailScale 这边 MTU 已经是正确的了，但是仍然无法连通，希望大家能指点一下排查思路\n题外：有没有什么推荐的书可以比较系统性地介绍一下类似的网络知识？不需要细致到能进行相应开发工作的程度，只需要能够在网络出现问题时能够定位大致方向和排查思路即可\n提前谢谢各位～",

          "description": "大家好，我是哥飞。\n今天给大家推荐两个开源项目，SoraWebui 和 FakeSoraAPI 。\nSoraWebui 开源地址： https://github.com/SoraWebui/SoraWebui\nSoraWebui 演示网站： https://sorawebui.com/\nFakeSoraAPI 开源地址： https://github.com/SoraWebui/FakeSoraAPI\nFakeSoraAPI 演示网站： https://fake-sora-api.sorawebui.com/\n众所周知，目前 Sora 别说还没发布 API ，甚至连公测都还没开始。\n那么根据哥飞的教程《找新词：一个永远有效的建站策略，让你快速拿到搜索引擎流量》，怎么去做 Sora 这个词呢？\n很简单，看看目前最大的需求是什么？\n对于广大普通用户来说，目前最大的需求就是及时欣赏到最新的 Sora 生成的视频。对于技术人可能是了解 Sora 的最新资讯，了解 Sora 的原理。\n那么我们就可以收集整理最新最全的 Sora 生成的视频，Sora 的最新动态，Sora 的相关论文，然后做一个网站来展示这些视频和信息。\n事实上，哥飞社群的朋友们就是这么做的，并且哥飞知道的已经上线了十几个网站了。\n同时哥飞也发现，老外也在做这个事情，如这个网站 madewithsora.com 就是一个老外做的，目前已经被到处传播了。\n\n这个网站发布几天，已经在 Similarweb 看到访问量了，虽然不是真实访问量，但知道有访问量就足够了。\n\n那么这一次 Sora 的热度到底有多大呢，我们先看看 GPT 这个词在 Similarweb 上面显示的月平均搜索量是 250 万。\n\n然后再看谷歌趋势里 Sora 和 GPT 的对比，2 月 16 日 Sora 消息刚发布时，最高热度，Sora 达到了 GPT 的一半还多，也就是有一百多万的月度搜索量了。\n\n虽然后来慢慢热度下降了，但也只是因为目前大家还无法直接体验 Sora ，等到后面 OpenAI 开放 Sora 之后，热度绝对会重新上来。\n作为对比，我们再看看 GPTs 的热度，可以看到在 11 月 13 日达到高峰的。\n\n那就看 11 月 13 日那天，GPT 和 GPTs 的对比，你会发现 GPTs 的搜索量就是渣渣，而 Sora 的搜索量有 GPT 的一半还多，就足以说明 Sora 的量有多大了。\n\n当然 GPTs 看起来这么渣渣，主要是跟 GPT 对比造成的错觉，实际 GPTs 的需求能够支撑起 GPTsHunter.com 83 万和 GPTstore.ai 100 万的访问量。\n\n\n那么大家就可以想象一下你做的 Sora 相关网站拿到了流量，能是有多大的规模了，哥飞估算，到时候肯定会出现多个几百万访问量的网站。\n那么怎么接住这泼天流量呢？\n当然就需要提前准备，不可能等到了 OpenAI 宣布 API 开放那天，你才去做一个网站。因为到那时候，你就很难竞争过有先发优势的别的网站了。\n怎么提前准备？\n当然就是现在立刻马上，就在今天，赶紧上线一个 Sora 相关的网站。\n所以今天哥飞才给大家推荐开头说过的两个开源项目。\n我们先说下 SoraWebui ，这是一个开源的 Sora AI 视频生成 Web 客户端，可以对标 GPT 客户端。\n大家先看一下用这个项目部署的演示网站，可以输入提示词，“生成”视频。\n用文字生成视频，整个流程是能够走通的。\n\n细心的你可能会发现，哥飞在“生成”这个词上打引号了。\n因为目前还没有 Sora API ，当然无法真的生成视频了。\n那么视频怎么来的呢？\n这就要介绍第二个开源项目 FakeSoraAPI ，项目开发者通过参考 DALL-E 的接口，去猜测 Sora API 可能的请求方式、请求参数和返回数据格式，开发了一个 Fake Sora API ，就是假的 Sora API 。\n假的 API 无法凭空生成视频，但是可以基于提示词帮你选择一个合适的视频返回，这样不管是你自己开发 Sora 相关的产品，还是 SoraWebui 都可以通过调用 FakeSoraAPI 来走通文字生成视频的全流程。\n也就是说，即使目前 OpenAI 官方还没发布真正的 Sora API ，但也不影响我们开发一个 Sora 相关的产品。\n现在有了这两个开源项目，你就可以尽快自己上线一个 Sora 的相关网站了。",

          "description": "各位 V2EX 的朋友们，我在这里遇到了一个非常头疼的问题，急需大家的帮助和建议。我是一位《我的世界》公益服的服主，为了升级服务器性能，于春节前在京东自营店购买了一颗盒装 i9 14900K CPU 及主板、SSD 硬盘、CPU 散热器、内存条。然而，当我装机拆开盒子的时候，却惊讶地发现里面居然是上一代的 i9 13900K ！\n这对于我来说是一个非常大的打击，《我的世界》对单核性能有着严格的要求，而我之所以购买 i9 14900K 正是为了满足这一需求。经过两次的退货申请，售后却以我没有提供开箱视频为由拒绝退货，这让我这个消费者感到非常无奈。\n具体时间点是在春节前的 1 月 20 号左右购买，当晚停服边备份数据边研究主板和内存，CPU 散热器怎么安装，到最后才拆 CPU 。发现问题后于 1 月 23 号 23:53:22 拍照提交了第一次售后退货申请。第一次退货被告知仓库表示出库无误，称重符合，只能退还原物。第二次退货申请是在 2024 年 02 月 02 日 14:05:10 提交，售后电话明确表示可为我退货退款处理，有电话录音，但直至过完年都未见结果。昨天（ 2 月 20 日）再次联系售后，售后工单却是处理完毕且 APP 上看不到处理结果，电话过去告知不对版的 CPU 退还给我，无法再为我处理退货。\n作为一个《我的世界》公益服的服主，这次事件不仅耽误了服务器的升级计划，而且造成了我极大的精神困扰。我希望得到大家的建议，如有类似经历或者有解决办法的朋友请分享一下，让我能够解决这个问题。\nPS:今天晚上已在 12315 平台、黑猫投诉平台投诉。\n有没有人遇到过类似的情况？\n是否有办法能够让京东售后重新考虑我的退货申请？\n有没有其他途径可以解决这个问题？\n非常感谢大家的帮助！\n下面是相关订单图片",

          "description": "用 ChatGPT 能开发一个完整的 App 吗？\n之前有人问我，ChatGPT 如果用来开发一个完整的 App 可行吗？我的回答是“应该可以”，说完后就突然萌生一个想法，那就用 ChatGPT 开发一个验证一下？说干就干，捋了捋手头的现有的技术和自己的需求，决定做一个图像擦除类的应用。经过 2 周与 ChatGPT 的对话，这个完整用它开发的 App 已经诞生并且上线，名字叫做：Smoothrase ，Smooth - Erase 的合体，意为顺滑的擦除的意思，并且这个名字都是 ChatGPT 起的。\nApp 的主要功能就是，通过涂抹、圈选图片中多余的物体，去除多余物体，并且较好的还原原图内容。去除照片中的路人、线条、涂鸦、水印等多种场景适应。\n\n\n在整个使用 ChatGPT 开发的过程中，基本没有遇到大的错误，有一些小错误靠自己的经验或者通过运行都可以判断出来，为大家展示一下用 ChatGPT 开发一个完整的 App 的基本思路。\n目前只有 iOS 版本\n1. 创建一个新工程\n这一步当然无法使用 ChatGPT 完成，你必须要手动创建一个新项目，在 Xcode 中选择 File - New - Project, 新建一个 App 项目即可。\n\n2. 写一个根视图\n每一个 App 启动都会有一个首页，首先，我会告诉 ChatGPT 写一个根视图，作为这个 App 的首页，ChatGPT 可以很好的实现。\n\n\n可以看出，ChatGPT 可以创建一个新类作为首页，并把这个自定义的新类作为 App 的根视图。\n3. 设置首页显示手机中所有图片的列表\n想要一个 App 首页显示手机中的所有图片，你肯定不能就把这句话告诉 ChatGPT ，需要用程序化的思路一步步让 ChatGPT 实现它。\n首页显示所有图片列表，那需要用到 UICollectionView ，首先就需要让 ChatGPT 完成这个 UICollectionView\n\n\n\n我简单的写了几个描述，ChatGPT 就可以非常详细的为我实现所有的需求，之后再根据自己的需求进行简单的修改就可以使用。\n4. 获取所有手机中的照片\n首页列表要显示手机里的所有照片，我只需要简单的问一句话\n\n\nChatGPT 已经非常完整的实现了我想要的代码，并且可以分步讲解，非常高效\n5. 让 ChatGPT 实现第三方框架的代码\n\n这一步验证了，ChatGPT 也懂得如何使用第三方库的代码，所以完全可以放心让他做。\n\n以上所有写完后，这个 App 就能打开显示照片了。就像下面这样：\n\n以前需用纯手工写的一大片代码，只需要在 ChatGPT 中问几个问题就可以完成。\n这里只是写了一些基本的使用示例，用来验证 ChatGPT 确实可以应对基本的编程任务，如果一个 App 没有过多复杂的内容，ChatGPT 确实就可以完整的实现出来。",

          "description": "hi ，这篇帖子写在开工的头一天。明天就是正月初九了，开工的日子，先祝朋友们开工大吉，龙年健康快乐！\n之前写过一篇内容，谈了谈自己，和白酒事业，在这里 👉 30 岁，裸辞创业，从卖白酒开始\n今天来再分享一下，为什么将白酒，作为下半生的事业（之一）。\n所谓下半生，其实我今年 30 岁了，下半生，也就是 30 岁往后的年纪，如果我 60 岁退休，那么我还可以工作 30 年，如果 70 岁退休，那就是 40 年。如果中间因为不可抗力，比如我挂了，那就只能提前结束了，毕竟谁也不知道明天和意外谁先来。所谓下半生，就是余生的所有日子。\n那么下半生，我为什么专注于白酒？甚至 ALL IN 白酒。我来谈谈原因。\n第一：酒是我的爱好\n我喜欢喝酒，不论是白酒、啤酒（尤其是白啤）、洋酒（尤其是威士忌）、黄酒，我都喜欢。尤其是喝酒以后，我的话变得比平时多，思维变得更跳跃，酒壮怂人胆嘛。如果在古代，我就是书生一枚，怂人一个，但是李白说，唯有饮者留其名。我觉得现在的社会很牛逼，好像普通人除了规规矩矩遵纪守法以外，无法再为社会做些什么啦，我很着急的好嘛！可是既然没什么价值，那就喝酒消遣度日吧，不给社会添麻烦就可以了！说到消遣，我不喜欢打牌，因为太费脑子，我也不喜欢玩游戏，因为太菜影响队友。我喜欢喝酒，看到朋友们在一起喝酒开心我也开心，或者是自己不开心的时候喝点酒就会把所有的事情想开，格局忽然变得很大，可以原谅所有人（却不能原谅自己的一些事情，有时也酒后会想起来）。这些都是我爱喝酒的原因。甚至这篇文章，都是我在喝了七两多古越龙山之后写下来的，喝酒让我有脸皮在网上抒发抒发，所以酒是我的爱好。\n第二：每个中国人都需要白酒\n由生到死，中国人，谁都需要白酒。大事小事，都需要酒。这个市场会一直在，至少伴随我们这代人终老。\n第三：白酒胜过任何社交活动\n白酒是怎样一种存在呢，威士忌、伏特加也是烈酒，人们会坐在酒吧里品尝，但很少有人会坐下来品尝白酒。中国人通常会围坐在饭桌前，配几个下酒菜一起喝白酒，二两下肚，每个人都会打开话匣子，推杯换盏间，“兄弟我跟你说”、“兄弟你听我说”。三五十度的酒精，让人们快速进入忘我的状态。。。\n所以白酒是最快让人进入状态的酒精饮料，胜过任何社交活动。\n第四：白酒，永远不会过期\n有什么东西是越陈旧反而越值钱的？白酒定律跟摩尔定律完全相反。据我所知除了古董、药材，就剩白酒能保值了。但也不是无脑存就行了，白酒的贮藏也是复杂的事情。\n第五：酒精让人们的大脑减速，从减速中获得快乐\n如今生活节奏太快了，走入社会，兄弟们走得太快了。为了生活，亲人们走得太快了。这片土地的人们太含蓄，只能几两白酒下肚，借着酒劲豪迈地表达，借着酒劲说出那些平时不会说出的肺腑或是肉麻的话。酒精让思维减速，有时候何尝不是一种解脱。白酒不适合铁石心肠的人，从口到喉到胃的热辣，都暖不了心，那真是最深的孤独。\n最后\n其实可以说，这是篇引流的帖子，我不否认。但是为什么选 V2 这个地方，其实这里大部分用户应该都是不喜欢喝白酒的。\n但是我不爱逛别的论坛子，既然选择这里，那就接受所有聪明人的检阅吧。我相信能混迹这个论坛的人，至少突破了某种束缚。来自你们的，无论批评还是鼓励，都能对我有一些帮助，让我能更好地感知方向。\n一个曾经的程序员，开始卖白酒了，想到的只不过是来这里发个帖子，号召一些同伴，也是机缘巧合啦。\n所以你要不要一起？我们用余生，一起喝酒，一起做有意思的事情。我也很孤独啊，那不如一起抱团吧，以白酒为媒。\n关于下半辈子，还想要做的一些事情，就是希望能从 V2 开始，认识更多对白酒有兴趣的人，我们从喝酒开始，去不同的城市面基，杯子碰在一起，去特么的操淡的世界。\n想一起喝酒的朋友，余生很长，我们一起挥洒。小弟虽然人菜但是瘾大，在此广交天下酒友，希望有机会可以和全世界的朋友一起喝酒。\n另外就是对于一些在为生计忙碌的朋友，也希望我的白酒资源能帮你赚到更多钱，我们一起卖白酒，从小开始，从身边做起，从点滴开始，尽可能地改善生活。这件事没有什么门槛，也不占用太多精力。\n以后会不定期分享自己的白酒生意或其他的想法，但应该不会发太多，偶尔想起来就分享一些，让大家知道有我这么个人，知道我还活着，知道我还在卖白酒就可以啦。我的酒就是我的人品。\n放个二维码吧，想要一起喝酒或是一起卖酒的朋友都可以加。如果是喝酒，加我的时候就备注喝酒（最好也能说下你的称呼，加的人点多昵称会分不清，我就这一个微信号，生活即工作），如果是想要一起卖酒，加了之后跟我说下，我建了白酒交流群，拉你进群，这个群未来二十年会一直在。\n\n以上，写于 2024 甲辰年，丙寅月，辛亥日。",

          "description": "​\t\t毫无疑问的，在恋爱关系中要保持自我，在同事关系中要保持自我，在亲人关系中要保持自我。当然，保持自我不等于保持自私。\n\"保持自我\"意味着保持自己的独立性、原则和个性，不随波逐流，坚守自己的信念和立场。\n\"保持自私\"则是指过度关注自己的利益和需求，不顾他人感受，缺乏为他人考虑的行为。\n在日常生活中，我们通常鼓励人们保持自我，即坚持自己的原则和价值观，但同时也要注意不要过于自私，要考虑他人的感受和需求。\n​\t\t就像是跨过水坑时明知道那块石头不稳但还是心存侥幸的踩上去一样，在和 Y 小姐的关系中，我一如既往的失去了自我。回头来看，没有自我的男人，就像是一条被阉割的听话公狗。对于主人来说，是能被以挥之即来挥之即去的态度所对待的东西。\n​      老生常谈的话：“明白了很多道理，却还是过不好这一生”。道理我都懂，和 Y 小姐认识之前，我就知道男女交往过程中要保持自我，不能只做围绕太阳公转的行星。人生中的遗憾又增加了一点：我没有时时刻刻牢记这点。\n​      和 Y 小姐第一次见面于 2024-01-21 ，最后一次见面是 2024-02-07 ，之后就是春节假期。18 天的时间里我们见了 5 次面，当然还有数不清的微信聊天记录。有开心，有内耗。\n​\t\t我喜欢 Y 小姐的外貌和身材，不是倾国倾城，幼瘦美的她刚刚好长在了我的审美上。Y 小姐是个挺健谈的人，第一次见面也会主动找话题，我们的交流一直没有迎来冷场。用 Y 小姐后来的话说，她觉得我们挺有共同话题的。和自己有兴趣的人一起相处，碰巧也能感受到对方也对你有兴趣，这大概就像是炎炎夏日口干舌燥时喝上一口玻璃瓶装冰可乐（有糖版本！）。\n​\t\t多么美妙的开局！不幸的时我觉得搞砸了这场游戏。\n​      我本以为自己已经完成对女性的祛魅，已经挣脱了当下社会对男女交往模式的主流意识的束缚。知之不若行之。等到真正行动起来之后我才发现，我还是那个我。\n​\t\t见面时我做计划安排者，做付款者（ Y 小姐吃饭还是付过一次钱的,我和她大概 10：1 ），微信聊天时我做倾听者，做捧场王。我把让 Y 小姐开心摆到了第一位。我自愿跳入 Y 小姐架设的条条框框中（房子和高彩礼）。我主动做 Y 小姐情绪的奴隶，为什么说是主动的呢？因为 Y 小姐心情不好的时候，我主动问她是不是心情不好，是不是因为我某件事情没有做好，你看，我主动把枷锁套在了自己的脖子上。\n​\t\t一年以前我写过和 A 小姐的故事，现在突然反应过来，我和 A 小姐难受的相处关系最应该怪的人是我自己。是我自己的一言一行，搭建起了我和 A 小姐还有 Y 小姐的相处模式，而我本来有可能扭转社会对她们潜移默化的影响。比这更可悲的是，我的思想和言行何其分裂：思想上我反对当下社会对男女交往的主流意识，但行动上我却是其最大的拥趸。有分裂，就会有内耗。\n​\t\t为什么我不能保持自我呢？\n​\t\t本质上我觉得自己不是一个自信的人：我没有自己引以为豪的特长、特质（有特长特质，但没有到自己引以为豪的地步），我的原生家庭不够富有，我的精神不够强大。\n​\t\t除此之外，从小我被教育不要招惹别人，要多照顾、顾虑别人的感受，要这样子要样子，让我成了一个敏感的人。没有人告诉我你要去做让你自己开心的事。\n​\t\t所以我应该是“低人格”的人。不论是在男女交往中，还是其他方面。所以我以讨好地方式来祈求爱也就不奇怪了。\n​\t\t语文老师教的，一篇文章（日记也算）结尾要有个总结，那这篇日记我的总结是：去做个自信自爱的人，才能自我。\n​      \n​",

          "description": "起因是两个痛点：\nIO 常用方法，比如读取和写入文件，每次都要写一长串，好烦\n调试代码时候偶尔会出现忘记把'w'模式改成'r'模式，导致数据被意外清空的情况\nwith open('text.txt', 'w', encoding='utf-8') as f:\n    f.write(\"Hello World!\")\nwith open('text.txt', 'r', encoding='utf-8') as f:\n    text = f.read()\n\n由于编码基本上除了 utf-8 很少用别的，所以直接两句话写成函数，变成：\nfrom pipeit import Read, Write\n\nWrite(\"text.txt\", \"Hello World!\")\ntext = Read(\"text.txt\")\n\n好处除了少写几个字外，拆成 Read 和 Write 更不容易调错模式。\n当然，这是幼儿园时候做的工作了，不值一提。\n但是事已至此还有一个痛点，就是在这种模式下需要使用序列化的话（这也是常用操作），逻辑顺序就不太对\nfrom pipeit import Read, Write\nimport json \n\nl = list(range(10))\nWrite(\"l.json\", json.dumps(l))  # 符合向 A 文件写入 B 的逻辑顺序\nll = json.loads(Read(\"l.json\")) # 书写顺序上，不是先“读”再“解”，感觉写起来很别扭\n\npy 做链式逻辑和函数式运算经常出现这种不太舒服的问题，不舒服这么长时间也一直忍着了。不过今天临睡前突然脑洞，既然函数式运算可以将习惯改成l = range(10) | Filter(lambda x:x^2) | Map(str) | list这种形式，读写能不能也进一步魔改一下，变成如下效果：\njson.dumps(list(range(10))) | Write(\"l.json\")\nl = Read(\"l.json\") | json.loads\n\n想了想，类似管道的写法用魔术方法重载可以很容易地实现，但是需要同时让 Read/Write 函数能向管道传递东西，又能直接读文件到字符串，这就需要再多费些力气了。于是又推迟睡眠时间 1 小时，罪过罪过，明天一定早睡。。。\n最后成品效果大概是这样：\n\n思路大概是用内建的 inspect 和 ast 模块实现抽象和反射，让Read()既是类也是函数，需要是类就是类，需要是函数就是函数。。。困了，代码还没整理上传到 pypi ，有时间再搞吧。\n没什么意义，有点回字的四种写法。但是一个语言能灵活至此，我玩得很开心就是。",

          "description": "无意中踩了个坑，而且还很抽象。\nwin11 （ win10 及以前的不知道）设置里有个选项“使用我的登录信息在更新后自动完成设置”，在账户>登录选项里，开启后可以实现开机系统自动登录上次的账户，完成所有程序的开机自启，再自动锁定。而且并不需要等程序启动完成再锁定，是异步的，所有开机后往往会看见登录屏幕闪一下，那就是自动登录又马上锁定，程序就在后台慢慢自启。\nwindows 的自启有很多实现方式，服务、计划任务、组策略、注册表、启动文件夹，等等，不同的程序往往可能选用不同的方式，所以在任务管理器的启动栏和设置的自启应用里面看到的不一定是全部，管家类程序能检测到的会更全一些，但也不一定是全部。\n用户如果想手动设一个应用开机自启，最简单的方式是把快捷方式丢到启动文件夹里面，也就是win+r输入shell:startup打开的文件夹，但这种方式设置的程序在用户登录，也就是输入密码之后才会自启。如果想开机就自启，往往需要创建一个合理设置的计划任务，但这种方式又不适用于 GUI 程序，一般都是命令行程序或 bat 脚本；或者用 winsw 包装成服务。而且不管怎么说，一个程序就要对应操作一轮，比较麻烦。这是不登录情况下的解决办法。\n说回正题，本来我电脑默认就是设置好的，导致我以为开机登录前完成自启理所当然，最近脑子一热玩了玩optimizer和SophiApp，这俩都是所谓优化 windows 的，适合装新机的时候用一下，快速改掉 win 部分默认的糟糕设置。其中 optimizer 就有一个win11->加强隐私的设置，看上去人畜无害，我就点了，结果重启以后就不能登录解锁前应用程序自启了。\n什么问题呢？这个加强隐私是个复合设置项，同时会修改多个设置，其中包含了 win11 设置的隐私和安全性>诊断和反馈>诊断数据，而从组策略层级禁用这个诊断数据会不知为何导致使用我的登录信息在更新后自动完成设置的界面变为“其中一些设置由你的组织管理”并强制禁用，也就是设置变灰无法更改。更为奇怪的是，手动去组策略管理器里面根本找不到修改项，不知道 optimizer 是怎么实现的，或者 win11 设置界面只是统一显示“其中一些设置由你的组织管理”，实际上修改的内容并非如此。\n题外话，勾选这个设置还会导致就近共享不能用，虽然有详情说明，因为那糟糕的翻译我一开始也没反应过来。\n解决方法也很简单，把勾选的勾掉，再去设置里面确认，果然隐私诊断数据和登录自启都恢复了。\n所以说，真的是能用就别乱改，不懂原理和细节就别乱玩，当时候坑的还是自己。windows 表面上的同一个功能可能会有复数个设置对应，它们之间可能是“与”的关系，也可能是“或”的关系，还可能有不同的优先级。win10 和 win11 的新版设置，老版的控制面板，注册表，组策略管理器，最喜闻乐见的当然是改一处其他地方一起变，但很多时候某个设置是某个地方独占的或者独立的，这种情况就需要仔细斟酌了。",

Each user has a maximum number of compute points they can use over a set period of time. Each bot displays the number of points required to send a message. This means you have the freedom to choose how you allocate your points: you can send many messages to higher compute point bots, more messages to less demanding bots, or balance your usage across a range of bots. For example: if you had only 10 messages left under our previous message cap, your options were limited. Now, with compute points, that same allowance could let you send up to 15 messages to ChatGPT or Assistant, offering you more flexibility and opportunities to interact with bots on Poe.\n计算点是一种让用户更灵活地控制您与 Poe 上的机器人通信方式的方法。每个用户在设定的时间段内可以使用的最大计算点数。每个机器人显示发送消息所需的点数。这意味着您可以自由选择如何分配积分：您可以向计算点较高的机器人发送许多消息，向要求较低的机器人发送更多消息，或者在一系列机器人之间平衡您的使用。例如：如果您在我们之前的消息上限下只剩下 10 条消息，那么您的选择就会受到限制。现在，有了计算点，同样的限额可以让你向 ChatGPT 或 Assistant 发送多达 15 条消息，为你提供更大的灵活性和机会与 Poe 上的机器人互动。\n\nSubscribers receive a higher number of compute points, which are allocated and renewed on a monthly basis, as opposed to daily. See all the benefits of subscribing in the Subscription FAQ.\n订阅者收到的计算点数量更多，这些计算点按月分配和续订，而不是每天。在订阅常见问题解答中查看订阅的所有好处。\n\nNon-paying users receive compute points daily, which reset at the end of each 24-hour period. Points do not roll over. If you need more compute points, you can wait for them to renew tomorrow, or subscribe to receive a higher number of compute points.\n非付费用户每天收到计算点，这些点在每 24 小时结束时重置。积分不会滚动。如果需要更多计算点，可以等待它们明天续订，或者订阅以接收更多数量的计算点。",

          "description": "我不知道买什么车，最好不买。\n一年多前别人说电油混动好，比如驱逐舰 05\n有人说合资车好，我网上看了日系车。又想着家里人可能觉得日本造孽深。看了大众。不管电，油还是混搭。感觉不好选，有些没有 360 ，没有 360 我害怕。\n可能之后我对逼养的看了很多，主要看了中控挂档操作，看了驱逐舰 05 的操作方式，确实方便了一点点。但个人感觉传统的就行，我是保守派。网上看了打算选了有 360 影像的。虽然我讨厌中国互联网，但我看样子只能选国产。\n别人知道我选逼养的。别人推荐了元 plus 。我就看了，比桥车的贵，就打算选了 510km 有 360 的。然后去看了别人的元的车。我不知道在看什么，明明网上都有介绍和图片的和视频的，了解一下不传统的中控操作就得了。我不打算进驾驶室，不打算试开。别人说他以前看到车很想握方向盘。坐了后排空间是很大。\n然后元 plus 车主跟我推荐宋 plus ，就贵 3 万。优点车大，如果他现在买肯定买宋。还在汽车之家给我看了内饰和外观，我想有什么好看的。4s 店他有朋友，可以优惠一两千。\n问我要选择元还是宋，我说能开就行。\n别人说能开就行，二手车就可以了。也有推荐油的，我是几步路开开的车。有人说车好有面子，别人反驳他说现在那么多人有车，要什么面子，10 万，10 多万，还有人开 300 多万呢。\n买来我打算能不开就不开，通勤不打算开，休息日能躺在床上就躺床上。\n我感觉电车也有阴谋。智能化也会让我不舒服。\n我都不想买了，别人这个词是认识的好几个人。\n别人很看重车的好坏。\n我觉得能开就行。我不想买，强迫我买，迫不得已，买来我也不开，谁爱开谁开去，让我带就让别人爬去，打死别人。\n让我考驾照骗我考来就好，考来却马上催买车，我都不想开，我承认确实害怕。\n我也不想找女朋友找对象结婚生孩子生儿子养孩子培养孩子了。拖到死。\n能开不就行了，还选这车选哪车，到头来我没有选择的权利。\n一开始想着驱逐舰 05 混动 55 不就好了，然后受别人影响，选秦纯电，然后元 plus 然后宋 plus ，选你妈呢选，越选越贵，10 万选到 17 万。",

          "description": "先说下背景：\n老家广东普宁，广东一个十八线县级市。\n买房的预期跟父母稍微统一了一点，期望是 150 平差不多的四室，近市中心，配套齐全。    \n现在买房抉择有两个：  \n父母倾向于买小产权（这边主要是那种村子集资盖的集体房），出于便宜，我们那边很多人买（均价现在是 3000-5000 ）；    \n我稍微倾向于大产权，将来好置换（虽然好像也没啥置换的可能？我将来有没有买房定居的需求都不好说），法律风险小（小产权遇到拆迁大概率不会补贴购房者），（现在均价 6000-10000 ，但我只能接受 8000 以下的，能力有限，兼之我是看跌这种小城市的）；  \n所以总的预算是 50-120 （小产权可以全款拿下，大产权就要考虑分期、按揭了，现在利率下行，买了应该还是负资产），仅毛胚房，装修还得另外算，可能得一点点装修。  \n现在是在下面的一个小农村里住爷爷盖的老房子（老厝），一家 7 口只能说能住，所以算是刚需，买了新房之后可以全家住（ 2+2+2+1 ）刚好四室，另外在市区，父母也可以选择换工厂做，通勤也近，少走些路（当然我本心是希望父母可以少打点工，多休息，身体重要）。  \n4 个一线打工人（包括我）都在外，一个还在读书，出资方面我应该出 95%，也可能全出，父母务工赚的少，加上之前供子女读书，存的少，其他人刚出来没多久，存的也少，我出来 4 年了，加上是程序员，赚的多些。  \n关于自己：  \n家中长子，一个普通程序员，在深工作 4 年，积蓄主要是工资，投资理财方面，A 股亏了 3W （包括股票基金），其他主要放在债券、货币基金上，还属于是理财小白，挺想留在大城市，但一线房价对于我这种打工人真的很难。  \n我还是单身，没有对象，这套房子其实我挺纠结，因为基本是要掏空自己存款的，但我就过年来住，我将来会在哪里也是不确定的，买这个房子有照顾父母面子的成分。  \n对于个人将来规划，现在比较迷茫，以前毕业时刚在一个中厂工作，每天下班都能刷题、刷八股，想着将来进大厂，后面遇到大厂收缩，裁员，投都投不出去，后面跳去一家外企，待没多久就市场收缩，整个部门端掉，后来面阿里，HR 面挂，对将来挺心灰意冷的，现在在一家小公司待着，持续学英语，但好像也没有特别大的动力往外走，可能后面会回家乡可以尝试远程（不确定）。偶尔想着转行做生意，但没有经验跟主意。  \n一些疑问/求助：  \n在当下，股市、房市、人口下行，有点像日本负债衰退的情况下，这个点买房合适吗？买小产权还是大产权合适？另外有在县城买房的朋友，或者相关经验，求助下，我该怎么做合适？",

Apple 为什么要设置这么复杂，以激活日期算不行吗？\n不行，激活日期不是购买日期，法律规定保修期是按购买日期计算的。\n2. 如果购买半年后再拆封激活，保修是怎么算？\n如果 Apple 知道你的实际购买日期，比如说你官网买的，那不拆封是你的事，你的保修只剩半年了。\n如果 Apple 不知道，比如说你经销商买的，那就根据出厂日期算，如果还在 1 年内，可以找一张发票验证购买日期，可以获得满保修。\n3. Apple 究竟在防什么？\nApple 不是在防什么，Apple 只是真的不知道你什么时候买的。但也不能给你无限的时间。\n如果你买一台电脑，10 年不激活，还能给你保修到第 11 年吗？没零件了，只能给你换新款了。\n如果我是商家，这就是投资理财了，大 BUG 。\n4. 为什么是 60 天这个节点？\n因为很久以前，互联网还不健全的时候，法律规定的保修期，就是：\n(1) 以发票日期计算\n(2) 以出厂时间+60 天计算\n80 后可能还记得，00 后基本没这个印象了。\n-----\n还有什么想问的，留言，上线就回",

          "description": "白色长条的日光灯是不少人童年中的记忆。而随着经济发展和审美水平的普遍提高，我们对于光的期许，也从单纯的照亮夜晚变成了营造氛围，单一、无法调节的白色照明已经无法满足我们的需求。\n但灯光配置对许多人来说也是一个难题。如果是自己购置的新房，还可以根据自己的喜好和家装设计师的方案来动态选择，但并非人人都有这样的前置条件。面对几乎无法改动硬装的租房，就必须忍受无法改变的「一片死白」了吗？\n并不是如此。我这几年一直在租房环境下探索「无主灯」式的布置思路，一路上积攒了不少经验。事实表明，即便是有主灯的设计，也可以通过一些小巧思转变为无主灯的效果，而且不用涉及到硬装改造，或者能够还原。\n如果你也想给自己打造一个合适好用的环境光，不妨跟着我的思路一起探索，或许会对你有所启发。\n\n    刚搬进来时候的样子\n\n\n文中提及的灯具汇总\n这里整理了我家里目前用的一些灯具，以偏黑白灰 + 木纹的中古简约风为主。仅供参考，你可以直接「抄作业」，也可以根据自己的审美和需求来调整。\n分类\n                产品\n                说明\n            \n可换灯泡\n                \n                    \n宜家索尔克林台灯\n宜家安卡派落地灯\n一个后续会换掉的奶油风吊灯\n淘宝随便买的一个台灯灯罩\n均搭配 Nanoleaf Essentials E27（Thread 版）灯泡使用\n            \n智能灯具\n                \n                    \nAqara 幻彩吸顶灯 T1；\nAqara 吸顶灯 T1；\nYeeLight Pro 屏幕挂灯；\nYeeLight 灯带；\n自己 DIY 的偏置照明灯条；\n飞利浦智睿球泡灯；\n均接入 HA 并桥接到 HomeKit 控制\n            \n非智能灯具\n                \n                    \n轨道灯\n双头射灯\n通过 Aqara S1E 开关接入智能控制。\n具体型号不做推荐，可以根据个人需要选择灯的数量和轨道长度等，但也别忘了重点关注频闪、Ra 值和色温\n「好灯光」是什么？\n目前的租房市场里，绝大部分的照明系统还秉承着「有了且能用就行」的原则，依旧被日光灯、单色白光吸顶灯占据主流。一旦它们开始工作，就会完全不考虑你的感受，毫不客气地、硬生生地把刺眼的白光塞满整个房间。\n所以，与之相对的，就是我对「租房好灯光」的定义：\n只照亮该照亮的位置，既能覆盖全屋，也能只点亮几个角落；\n拒绝纯粹的白光，给自己更多的颜色、亮度和色温选择权；\n灯光的显色指数达到 Ra90 以上，无可见频闪，视觉上观感舒服不刺眼。\n是不是有点熟悉？其实这也是无主灯照明的核心要义。但在租房环境下，由于无法做一些破坏性的装修，房屋的硬装、电网布局和灯具孔位都受到了严格限制，还要考虑搬家的带走和复原的需要，传统方案里常用的壁灯、轨道灯、联排射灯和吊顶灯条就毫无用武之地。\n不过让我们换一种解决的思路和角度 —— 既然上墙和入顶的灯无法使用，那么灵活可移动的落地灯、台灯乃至工作灯，都可以成为照亮环境的选择。这一方案的核心方法论非常简单粗暴：如果不能改变主灯的位置，那么就改变它的「地位」。而具体的实行方法也很简单：\n用更多的可移动的、灵活的灯光（甚至是蜡烛的光也可以）来替代主灯，或者冲淡它的存在感；\n在日常的使用中，更多地开启这些氛围灯具来代替主灯对空间的「无差别照明」。\n基于这些原则，租房的无主灯方案便有了落点。不过在改造开始前，理清自己的需求是先行步骤。千万不要脑子一热买些好看却无法优雅使用的灯具，还是要根据自己的实际环境与照明需求来思考如何安排。\n我家的照明方案\n我租下的房子为将近百平的房一厅布局，为旧村改造的回迁房。选择这个房子相比精装房有更大的好处，一是更加现代且没有「广东省省屋」的内部设计，符合我对房屋的审美，留给我改造的余地较大；二是有较好的弱电布局，方便我能为智能灯具准备好良好的无线网络。\n下面，我将根据我在家里生活的几个空间，来向你介绍我的无主灯照明方案。\n起居室：保留主灯的无主灯设计\n起居室占据的空间约在 25 平左右，开发商给的原始布局是两个白色的吸顶灯，一个位于沙发上方，一个位于餐桌上方。作为会见朋友、生活起居和猫主子的主要活动空间，我的改造目标主要有这些点：\n[......]\n查看全文\n本文为会员文章，出自《单篇文章》，订阅后可阅读全文。",

          "description": "OpenAI于2024年2月15日正式对外发布人工智能文生视频大模型Sora，Sora继承了DALL-E 3的画质和遵循指令能力，可以根据用户的文本提示创建逼真的视频，该模型可以深度模拟真实物理世界，能生成具有多个角色、包含特定运动的复杂场景，能理解用户在提示中提出的要求，还了解这些物体在物理世界中的存在方式。\n\r\n\r\nSora对于需要制作视频的艺术家、电影制片人或学生带来无限可能，其是OpenAI“教AI理解和模拟运动中的物理世界”计划的其中一步，也标志着人工智能在理解真实世界场景并与之互动的能力方面实现飞跃。\n\r\n\r\n今日下午，周鸿祎在微博发长文，谈论他对OpenAI刚刚发布的文生视频大模型Sora的看法。周鸿祎称，Sora意味着AGI实现将从10年缩短到1年。\n\r\n\r\n周鸿祎表示，很多人说Sora的效果吊打Pika和Runway，这很正常，和创业者团队比OpenAI这种有核心技术的公司实力还是非常强劲的。周鸿祎认为，AI不一定那么快颠覆所有行业，但它能激发更多人的创作力。今天Sora可能给广告业、电影预告片、短视频行业带来巨大的颠覆，但它不一定那么快击败TikTok，更可能成为TikTok的创作工具。\n\r\n\r\n此外，周鸿祎还提到，现在所有的文生图、文生视频都是在2D平面上对图形元素进行操作，并没有适用物理定律。但Sora产生的视频里，它能像人一样理解坦克是有巨大冲击力的，坦克能撞毁汽车，而不会出现汽车撞毁坦克这样的情况。\n\r\n\r\n所以他理解这次OpenAl利用它的大语言模型优势，把LLM和Diffusion结合起来训练，让Sora实现了对现实世界的理解和对世界的模拟两层能力，这样产生的视频才是真实的，才能跳出2D的范围模拟真实的物理世界。这都是大模型的功劳。\n\r\n\r\n以下为全文：\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSora意味着AGI实现将从10年缩短到1年\n\r\n\r\n周鸿祎\n\r\n\r\n年前我…",

          "description": "近日，特斯拉创始人兼首席执行官埃隆∙马斯克在“X”上发文称，打算放弃使用移动通信，代之以社交媒体平台“X”。他发文表示，“几个月后我将注销自己的电话号码，只使用‘X’收发信息、接打音频和视频电话。\"\n\r\n\r\n“收购推特更名为“X”，欲打造一款包罗万象的应用程序\n\r\n\r\n马斯克此番做法，从以往的操作之中就可显端倪。自2022年10月27日，以440亿美元收购社交平台 Twitter（ 推特）以来，马斯克已经多次表示他想要打造2.0版Twitter，也就是一款包罗万象的应用程序，包含加密私信、长推文以及支付等功能。\n\r\n\r\n2023年5月，马斯克发布推文称：“很快将推出语音和视频聊天功能，你可以通过账号与平台上的任何人聊天，这样你就可以和世界上任何地方的人聊天，而不用给他们你的电话号码。”\n\r\n\r\n2022年10月，收购推特后，马斯克发文称，“这只小鸟获得自由。”\n\r\n\r\n3个月后，马斯克曾发帖称，“X”平台最近几个月创下了“用户活跃”纪录。据《华尔街日报》报道，“X”平台9月公布，其日活跃用户数为2.45亿，较马斯克在2022年11月发布的2.594亿有所下降，但高于推特平台2022年第二季度2.378亿的用户数。不过，研究公司Sensor Tower的分析显示，与马斯克收购的当月即2022年10月相比，“X”平台2023年9月的移动端日活跃用户数下降了16%。“X”平台的用户指标虽有下滑，但其用户量仍居市场领先地位。Sensor Tower指出，“X”平台的竞争对手、Meta公司的Threads平台在7月上线后虽引发了许多关注，但其用户数仍远不及“X”。\n\r\n\r\n不仅如此， X公司还于去年6月份在新罕布什尔州获得了第一张交易许可证，后续又陆续获得了宾夕法尼亚州、亚利桑那州、佐治亚州、马里兰州和密歇根州的批准。截至今年1月，美国已经有15个州批准X向用户提供支付功能。马斯克预计X将会在今年年中获得美国所有州的批准。\n\r\n\r\n从自己“开刀”，发出联系方式将彻底改变的信号\n\r\n\r\n记者查阅相关资料发现，马斯克正在进行大手笔押注，以便把经营艰难的X平台的微型博客转型为一家可以盈利，并与微信分庭抗礼的社交平台，具有可以满足用户日常需求的一站式通信枢纽功能。\n\r\n\r\n马斯克雄心勃勃的计划要想取得成功，X平台必须成为用户与世界的主要通信接口。实现这一目标的策略之一是说服人们从传统的电话通信转向通过X平台进行交流。现在，马斯克打算从自己开始，发出自己与世界的联系方式将发生彻底改变的信号。\n\r\n\r\n所以，马斯克告诉自己的1.7亿个粉丝账号：“在几个月后，我将停止使用我的电话号码，只使用X平台发短信和进行音频/视频通话。”\n\r\n\r\n在设法从其他社交应用程序那里吸收流量的过程中，马斯克已经对曾经的推特进行了彻底改造。马斯克和他的首席执行官琳达·亚卡里诺还设法达成了一些交易，包括与体育新闻主持人吉姆·罗马达成的一项仅在X平台独家播发某些内容的协议。8日，亚卡里诺宣布与世界摔跤娱乐公司建立新的合作关系，从而将只向X平台用户播放长度为5分钟的视频。在此过程中，马斯克也招致了争议。不过，这些争议对于马斯克来说算不了什么，而且永远不乏深信马斯克不管多么困难都能取得成功的人。\n\r\n\r\n俄罗斯总统普京本周在接受美国知名媒体人卡尔森的采访时说：“没有什么能够阻止埃隆·马斯克。”\n\r\n\r\n来源：北青网",
