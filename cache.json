          "description": "Our bias is to always add more. More rules, more process, more code, more features, more stuff. Interdependencies proliferate, and gradually strangle us. Systems want to grow and grow, but without pruning, they collapse. Slowly, then spectacularly.\nWhen a piece of trash drifts across the beach, it is our duty to pick it up so the next person can enjoy a pristine shoreline. When a thousand pieces litter the beach, it is too late. We can only lament the landscape. That’s just how beaches are now.\nA good system is designed to be periodically cleared of cruft. It has a built-in counterbalance. Without this pressure, our bias drives us to add band-aid after band-aid, until the only choice is to destroy the whole system and start from scratch.\nWhy is it so much easier to add than to remove? Maybe because we attach our identity to what is visible. But there is a difference between the ornamentation that defines our style and the vestigial burdens we carry.\nRemember those who did the invisible work of removing. Their legacy was not to build a sand castle, but to care for the beautiful beach on which we play.",

          "description": "I love Jupyter – it's how I learned to code back when I was working as a scientist. But I was always frustrated that there wasn't a simple and elegant app that I could use with my Mac. I made do by wrapping JupyterLab in a chrome app, and then more recently switching to VS Code to make use of Copilot. I've always craved a more focused and lighter-weight experience when working in a notebook. That's why I created Satyrn.\nIt starts up really fast (faster time-to-execution than VS Code or JupyterLab), you can launch notebooks right from the Finder, and the design is super minimalist. It's got an OpenAI integration (use your own API key) for multi-cell generation with your notebook as context (I'll add other LLMs soon). And many more useful features like a virtual environment management UI, Black code formatting, and easy image/table copy buttons.\nFull disclosure: it's built with Electron. I originally wrote it in Swift but couldn't get the editor experience to where I wanted it. Now it supports autocomplete, multi-cursor editing, and moving the cursor between cells just like you'd expect from JupyterLab or VS Code.\nSatyrn sits on top of the jupyter-server, so it works with all your existing python kernels, Jupyter configuration, and ipynb files. It only works with local files at the moment, but I'm planning to extend it to support remote servers as well.\nI'm an indie developer, and I will try to monetize at some point, but it's free while in alpha. If you're interested, please try it out!\nI'd love your feedback in the comments, or you can contact me at jack-at-satyrn-dot-app.\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40899242\nPoints: 182\n# Comments: 60",

          "description": "Hi all! Excited to share rss2newsletter after completing dev work for the initial release.\nThe idea for this project came out of necessity, as I wanted to share my articles via email newsletter. I was looking for a super minimal, lightweight, and open source solution, and when none existed, I decided to create one.\nFor any sizable number of email recipients, a popular platform like Mailchimp will easily cost you hundreds or even thousands per month in per-contact fees. rss2newsletter, on the other hand, allows you to use Amazon SES, so you can reach your audience at pennies on the dollar.\nBeyond these factors, I also wanted something that could run on an internet-connected potato it's so easy on your system and fully automated so you can set it and forget it.\nSo, I created (and put under a free software license):\nhttps://github.com/ElliotKillick/rss2newsletter\nrss2newsletter (integrating with Listmonk and Amazon SES for ultra-low-cost emails) is a drop-in solution that requires almost no setup besides connecting with SES and styling your emails. It's also competitive at what it does with proprietary self-hosted solutions like Sendy, which requires your system/VPS to have some rather beefy specs to run well.\nLet me know if there are any other features you would like to see. I hope you can find my project helpful to you!\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40898313\nPoints: 32\n# Comments: 11",

          "description": "I've created Foorr, a minimal to-do list app that focuses on short-term getting-things-done and the option to do this with friends by holding each other accountable and helping each other grow together. Main goal is to fuel your progress whatever needs to be done and hold yourself accountable for your own progress (with some external motivation).\nHere's what it does:\n- Create tasks for today and tomorrow only (real hyperfocus on short term GTD).\n- Invite friends to cheer each other moving forward.\n- Building up a daily streak as you finish all tasks daily. All tasks completed before midnight which were planned for that day, earns you a level up. Rewarding that sense of completion.\nWhy I built it:\nI used physical post-it notes and was a bit done with it. I really wanted something minimal focusing only on my to-do's for today and tomorrow.\nNo bloated features, nothing to fancy/polished, just something no-nonsense I wanted to use myself. It might be useful for others who struggle with procrastination and keeping op progress getting things actually done. Feedback is definitely welcome and nice to hear if this resonates with anyone else.\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40877708\nPoints: 14\n# Comments: 8",

          "description": "Transfer Thought is a No-Code platform that makes it so anyone can build VR apps directly in their browser.\nWe started this company part-time, building it during commutes to and from work on the train. Over the last 5 years, we've experienced many ups and downs:\n- Gained early customers\n- Quit our day jobs\n- Secured angel funding\n- Survived with a short runway\n- Accepted into Techstars Chicago\n- Survived with a short runway (again)\n- Landed our biggest client ever, a Fortune 100 company\n- Despite our highest revenue, our burn rate caught up to us\nWe looked at different ways to wind down the company and ultimately felt open sourcing the platform was the best way to do right by our customers.\nNow, anyone who is interested in starting a VR company or just building an app can pick up where we left off. I'm excited about this space, if you need help with a VR app, or want to talk tech, please reach out.\nCheck out the repo: https://github.com/transferthought/transfer-thought\nContact me at keenan [at] transferthought [dot] com.\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40869706\nPoints: 7\n# Comments: 0",

          "description": "jb is a UNIX tool that creates JSON, for shell scripts or interactive use. Its \"one thing\" is to get shell-native data (environment variables, files, program output) to somewhere else, using JSON encapsulate it robustly.\nI wrote this because I wanted a robust and ergonomic way to create ad-hoc JSON data from the command line and scripts. I wanted errors to not pass silently, not coerce data types, not put secrets into argv. I wanted to leverage shell features/patterns like process substitution, environment variables, reading/streaming from files and null-terminated data.\nIf you know of the jo program, jb is similar, but type-safe by default and more flexible. jo coerces types, using flags like -n to coerce to a specific type (number for -n), without failing if the input is invalid. jb encodes values as strings by default, requiring type annotations to parse & encode values as a specific type (failing if the value is invalid).\nIf you know jq, jb is complementary in that jq is great at transforming data already in JSON format, but it's fiddly to get non-JSON data into jq. In contrast, jb is good at getting unstructured data from arguments, environment variables and files into JSON (so that jq could use it), but jb cannot do any transformation of data, only parsing & encoding into JSON types.\nI feel rather guilty about having written this in bash. It's something of a boiled frog story. I started out just wanting to encode JSON strings from a shell script, without dependencies, with the intention of piping them into jq. After a few trials I was able to encode JSON strings in bash with surprising performance, using array operations to encode multiple strings at once. It grew from there into a complete tool. I'd certainly not choose bash if I was starting from scratch now...\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40864541\nPoints: 116\n# Comments: 42",

          "description": "Hi! I wanted to share an open source API-compatible replacement for SQS. It's written in Go, distributes as a single binary, and uses SQLite for underlying storage.\nI wrote this because I wanted a queue with all the bells and whistles - searching, scheduling into the future, observability, and rate limiting - all the things that many modern task queue systems have.\nBut I didn't want to rewrite my app, which was already using SQS. And I was frustrated that many of the best solutions out there (BullMQ, Oban, Sidekiq) were language-specific.\nSo I made an SQS-compatible replacement. All you have to do is replace the endpoint using AWS' native library in your language of choice.\nFor example, the queue works with Celery - you just change the connection string. From there, you can see all of your messages and their status, which is hard today in the SQS console (and flower doesn't support SQS.)\nIt is written to be pluggable. The queue implementation uses SQLite, but I've been experimenting with RocksDB as a backend and you could even write one that uses Postgres. Similarly, you could implement multiple protocols (AMQP, PubSub, etc) on top of the underlying queue. I started with SQS because it is simple and I use it a lot.\nIt is written to be as easy to deploy as possible - a single go binary. I'm working on adding distributed and autoscale functionality as the next layer.\nToday I have search, observability (via prometheus), unlimited message sizes, and the ability to schedule messages arbitrarily in the future.\nIn terms of monetization, the goal is to just have a hosted queue system. I believe this can be cheaper than SQS without sacrificing performance. Just as Backblaze and Minio have had success competing in the S3 space, I wanted to take a crack at queues.\nI'd love your feedback!\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40837610\nPoints: 326\n# Comments: 86",

          "description": "I'm not a genius, nor do I believe I'm the absolute best at what I do.\nIt took me 30 years to realize that, no matter how good I am, networking often determines success. I'm in a career I don't enjoy, unable to move up or change, while others get jobs through connections. About 80% of my colleagues were hired this way, while a few of us got in by luck.\nNetworking seems to drive career advancement.\nI'm naturally a loner and find it hard to feign interest in others' lives. I prefer spending time alone and struggle to genuinely connect with people.\nEmotional intimacy drains me, and I dread future interactions, even though I know this is normal.\nWhile I'm okay being alone, I feel that relationships are crucial for progress after a certain point.\nI even broke up with my partner because I can't handle constant companionship. It was so draining that I stopped enjoying sexual intimacy.\nI'm fine without a partner; I don't want to subject anyone to my solitude. However, I want to change careers, and I know connections are vital.\nI'm feeling stuck and unsure how to move forward. It seems the two crucial factor (luck and networking) are outside my influence.\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40833149\nPoints: 18\n# Comments: 13",

I've posted Pickcode a few times (most recently https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38365638), but we've improved things quite a bit so I thought it was worth posting again. This is a bit of 1.0 release after a long year of working on the company full time!\nPickcode is basically Replit-lite, for kids. The editor is simple: text editor + output console + big green button to run your code. We support Python, HTML/CSS/JS, Java, and our block/text hybrid language, Pickcode VL.  We're partners on code.org's Hour of Code, and hundreds of thousands of students have tried our free stuff through them.\nAn account for individual kids is totally free, and we offer some free Python and Pickcode VL lessons to get them started. We make money by selling licenses to schools for better customer support and roster/lesson management features.\nYou can use this demo account I made to try out the editor:\n  email: demo@student.pickcode.io\n  pw: Demo1234\n\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40831904\nPoints: 28\n# Comments: 7",

The best way to get started is with the docs - https://r2r-docs.sciphi.ai/introduction.\nThis is a major update from our V1 which we have spent the last 3 months intensely building after getting a ton of great feedback from our first Show HN (https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39510874). We changed our focus to building a RAG engine instead of a framework, because this is what developers asked for the most. To us this distinction meant working on an opinionated system instead of layers of abstractions over providers. We built features for multimodal data ingestion, hybrid search with reranking, advanced RAG techniques (e.g. HyDE), automatic knowledge graph…",

It crashes sometimes still on mobile devices.\nI wasn't able to take photogrammetry photos of the artifacts from the tomb in the Museo Egizio in Turin because they were traveling while I was there (and now the museum is closed to install a new roof anyhow), so I tried to include comparanda from other museums where I had scanned artifacts.\nI tested the same dataset with 3d Gaussian Splatting but that had lower resolution results for great complexity in frontend code and reduced performance on older devices. [3DGS tour: https://mused.com/en/tours/860/learn-about-3d-gaussian-splat...]\nMoving forward, if anyone's working on the same idea, I didn't find a good path to monetization through web-based 3d content, so I'll take the high resolution photogrammetry of spaces into Unreal and switch to desktop and headset builds.\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40789339\nPoints: 14\n# Comments: 2",

          "description": "After 13 years in SWE, working for startups, bigger companies, the golden handcuffs, etc, I can finally say that I think I'm finished.\nRight now I'm contracting to stay afloat, maintain flexibility and delve into entrepreneurship, but I truly don't know what the future holds for me anymore if building my own company doesn't work out. I have 0 inclination to go back to a 9-5 at a company coding for a living. I'm done. I've been an EM, which might arguably be the most miserable position that exists. I've been senior/staff at places, and honestly I just don't enjoy arguing about the structure of software anymore, I'm tired of the personalities, tired of the infantilization of the industry (frankly, it's embarrassing) but mostly, I just don't enjoy coding as much as I used to, unless I'm leveraging it to create an asymmetrical amount of value for me ($$$$) which is just not what a full time job is.\nHowever, I don't know what to look into as an alternative if I need a full time position once my wife and I start having kids. My strengths revolve around people and strategy. I've been considering sales at a tech company because to me, working harder and having an unlimited cap in what I can earn sounds pretty fantastic.\nWould love to hear any kinds of stories or tips from folks\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40780940\nPoints: 95\n# Comments: 41",

          "description": "Hey HN! I've built this cli tool to manage env variables of a project, but mostly for fun and to try out Rust and the clap crate.\nI had this idea when I made a big mistake and broke some production stuff because I had a very messy .env file laying around in my project.\nI was implementing new features for one of my projects and in my .env file I had the test database url commented out and the production one was not. Long story short, I applied migrations to the production database instead of my local test one and broke a lot of production APIs :')\nI wanted a tool that could easily help me spot these issues before something bad happened, and so I built envelope for that reason.\nInstead of a \\.env(\\..+)? file, I now use this tool to add variables to different configurations: dev, prod etc. and I feed them to the program I am executing on a one liner.\n  $ envelope init\n  $ envelope add dev db_url localhost:5432/postgres\n  $ envelope add dev db_username username\n  $ envelope add dev db_pwd pwd\n  $ export $(envelope list dev)\n  $ ./run.sh\n\nA very useful feature that I use quite a lot is the `check` command which is going to tell you which environment you have currently active\n  $ export $(envelope list dev)\n  $ envelope check\n  > dev\n\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40758703\nPoints: 61\n# Comments: 34",

          "description": "When working with a team, I've found that Scrum-like short-term goals and organized task backlogs really help keep me focused and on track with the work I have to do. For solo development, however, I've never really found any approach that sticks and often end up getting sidetracked and losing track of my objectives.\nSo my question to all of you is, what tools and techniques have you used to ensure you stick to your objectives?\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40742831\nPoints: 29\n# Comments: 16",

          "description": "This is the first iteration of a short game I’m making that tries to interactively explain some of my favorite math questions / ideas. My goal is mostly to get the player curious and not necessarily to explain absolutely everything.\nThere were a lot of fun technical parts to building this:\n- For implementation reasons, it’s much easier if the lines all have integer intersection points with each other. To do this, when a new line is added I “cheat” by rounding intersections to integers and then splitting the old lines at the intersection into new linds (with potentially different slopes) going through the rounded point\n- I had to draw semi accurate maps of actual places (UK, South America, US west coast) in the HTML canvas using just line segments. I tried a few different solutions, including using SVG data. I ended up using the topojson library to give nice line approximations to GeoJSON maps\n- I use a simple backtracking algorithm to handle the live coloring of graphs\n- I use turf.js’s polygonize function to handle finding polygons from line segments (very happy I didn’t have to implement this myself!)\n- I wanted to make the game as mobile friendly as possible (don’t think I’ve nailed this quite yet)\nThere were also a few tradeoffs I made:\n- I wanted give links earlier in the game for players to learn more, but I decided to wait until the end to maintain the flow of the game\n- In order to make the game more mobile-friendly, I generally stuck to maps with a small number of regions (at least for maps people have to interact with them). So for the most part all of the instances in the game are “easy”\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40740021\nPoints: 411\n# Comments: 93",

          "description": "This is the third camera I've designed/made around the raspberry pi parts/ecosystem.\nThe repo has all the STL files, parts list, most wiring diagrams. The first one was the custom Pi Zero HQ cam which was featured on a Hackaday article/podcast.\nThe modular version (aside from being able to swap cameras) mostly has the latest software. Recently I added the ability to process videos in the background (ffmpeg merges wav/mp4 files together).\nThe camera uses crop-zoom-panning for dialing in shots with manual lenses. The menu is created by layering images/text with PIL. Live preview is a little slow as it's SPI based.\nIf anybody is a pro at python I'd appreciate insight on better code. I've mostly just followed a context-based folder layout regarding where everything is.\nI have not added custom/manual settings yet, it uses auto settings for the most part except for when you use a V3 camera module (which has electronic aperture) then it uses the d-pad to set the focus/diopter value.\nI have another camera in mind/future build although it's more tailored for videos.\nSome sample video I've shot.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkjXkQD0j9w\nAssembly video\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dXG-MoIw93Q\nAt some point I will rewrite the code for a new general purpose DIY camera software from what I've learned, that'll be an undertaking.\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40730245\nPoints: 34\n# Comments: 15",

          "description": "Hello HN!\nHere's Billard. It combines music and physics into a unique creative tool, as I explore various unconventional methods for generating music.\nMost traditional music composition tools revolve around the idea of a repeatable pattern.\nBillard is a webapp that never repeats itself. It generates music automatically based on the collisions of balls in a 2D space. Collisions trigger notes (or chords) in a given key. One can add balls or move them (y-position is pitch); the app remembers its state between reloads; or it can be reset with the 'init' button on the top left. Gravity can be adjusted in real time to change the behavior of the balls.\nIt owes a lot of inspiration to Brian Eno and Erik Satie (inventor of musique d'ameublement, or \"furniture music\"). Some may think the lack of pattern makes it not musical enough -- but this lets it be listened to —and watched— for a while without boredom.\nThe webapp is made using plain JavaScript. (All SVG icons were made 'by hand'.) It uses Tone.js only for triggering piano samples. Beyond piano, it's MIDI-enabled and works well at slow speed with haunting, dark synth sounds.\nHope you like it!\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40719782\nPoints: 134\n# Comments: 41",

          "description": "Hey HN! Tokencost is a utility library for estimating LLM costs. There are hundreds of different models now, and they all have their own pricing schemes. It’s difficult to keep up with the pricing changes, and it’s even more difficult to estimate how much your prompts and completions will cost until you see the bill.\nTokencost works by counting the number of tokens in prompt and completion messages and multiplying that number by the corresponding model cost. Under the hood, it’s really just a simple cost dictionary and some utility functions for getting the prices right. It also accounts for different tokenizers and float precision errors.\nSurprisingly, most model providers don't actually report how much you spend until your bills arrive. We built Tokencost internally at AgentOps to help users track agent spend, and we decided to open source it to help developers avoid nasty bills.\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40710154\nPoints: 40\n# Comments: 14",

          "description": "Hello HN!  First a quick background of what I am trying to search.\nIn 1983, Logo Computer Systems, Inc. (LCSI) published two popular versions of Logo.  One was meant to be run on Atari systems and the other was meant to be run on IBM PCs.\nThe manuals and documentation for the Atari LCSI Logo are very well archived on the world wide web.  The two I am particularly interested in are here:\nA) Atari Logo Reference Manual: https://atariwiki.org/wiki/attach/Logo/Atari%20LOGO%20Reference%20Manual.pdf\nB) Atari Logo Introduction to Programming Through Turtle Graphics: https://atariwiki.org/wiki/attach/Logo/Atari%20LOGO%20Introduction%20To%20Programing%20Through%20Turtle%20Graphics%20%281-sided%29.pdf\nOn page 3 of the first document (9th page in the PDF), there is a reference to the second document:\n> First time Logo users should start with the companion manual Introduction to Programming Through Turtle Graphics.\nHowever, sadly, the manuals for IBM LCSI Logo does not seem to be easily available.  I found the following:\nC) IBM Personal Computer Logo Reference: https://archive.org/download/ibm_logo_manual/ibm_logo_manual.pdf\nIt too has a reference to an introductory documentation:\n> The purpose of the IBM Personal Computer Logo Reference is to give you a thorough understanding of the many features of Logo by expanding the information contained in Logo: Programming with Turtle Graphics, which comes with IBM Personal Computer Logo.\nHowever, I have not been able to find a copy of this document anywhere.  Do you know any place I can get hold of a copy of the document titled \"Logo: Programming with Turtle Graphics\" that is meant to be used with IBM/LCSI PC Logo?\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40691792\nPoints: 26\n# Comments: 4",

Check out our clickthrough demo here: https://app.storylane.io/share/qyayvtamapis.\nOverwatch began when we were working with risk and threat intel teams at Google, Stripe, and government. We experienced the immense challenge every fraud and cyber threat analyst faces: manually parsing through an ocean of data to find valuable insights and filter out the noise. This included using many of the feeds and tools out there that were often very expensive, noisy, keyword-based, and lacked accurate entity extraction or advanced query features.\nMost threat intelligence tools utilize thousands of keywords and teams of analysts to ma…",

          "description": "We'd love to share our work with you: Restate, a system for workflows-as-code (durable execution). With SDKs in JS/Java/Kotlin and a lightweight runtime built in Rust/Tokio.\nhttps://github.com/restatedev/\nhttps://restate.dev/\nIt is free and open, SDKs are MIT-licensed, runtime permissive BSL (basically just the minimal Amazon defense).\nWe worked on that for a bit over a year. A few points I think are worth mentioning:\n- Restate's runtime is a single binary, self-contained, no dependencies aside from a durable disk. It contains basically a lightweight integrated version of a durable log, workflow state machine, state storage, etc. That makes it very compact and easy to run both on a laptop and a server.\n- Restate implements durable execution not only for workflows, but the core building block is durable RPC handlers (or event handler). It adds a few concepts on top of durable execution, like virtual objects (turn RPC handlers into virtual actors), durable communication, and durable promises. Here are more details: https://restate.dev/programming-model\n- Core design goal for APIs was to keep a familiar style. An app developer should look at Restate examples and say \"hey, that looks quite familiar\". You can let us know if that worked out.\n- Basically every operation (handler invocation, step, ...) goes through a consensus layer, for a high degree of resilience and consistency.\n- The lightweight log-centric architecture gives Restate still good latencies: For example around 50ms roundtrip (invoke to result) for a 3-step durable workflow handler (Restate on EBS with fsync for every step).\nWe'd love to hear what you think of it!\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40659160\nPoints: 125\n# Comments: 100",

          "description": "Hey folks! Mike here. Francois Chollet and I are launching ARC Prize, a public competition to beat and open-source the solution to the ARC-AGI eval.\nARC-AGI is (to our knowledge) the only eval which measures AGI: a system that can efficiently acquire new skill and solve novel, open-ended problems. Most AI evals measure skill directly vs the acquisition of new skill.\nFrancois created the eval in 2019, SOTA was 20% at inception, SOTA today is only 34%. Humans score 85-100%. 300 teams attempted ARC-AGI last year and several bigger labs have attempted it.\nWhile most other skill-based evals have rapidly saturated to human-level, ARC-AGI was designed to resist “memorization” techniques (eg. LLMs)\nSolving ARC-AGI tasks is quite easy for humans (even children) but impossible for modern AI. You can…",

          "description": "Hey HN,\nAs a Software Engineer, I frequently copy and paste content. The fact that macOS clipboard buffer can keep only one item is very frustrating. It’s very annoying to copy → switch app → paste → switch app → copy → switch app → paste, and so on. Losing items I copied hours ago and having to find and copy them again is a waste of time.\nI tried many third-party clipboard managers like Alfred, Raycast, Paste, Maccy, etc. While great, they didn't fully meet my needs.\nAs a developer, my requirements are:\n1. Keyboard-centric operation to avoid using the mouse. I don’t want to waste my time moving my hands from the keyboard.\n2. Display many clipboard history items at once. I don’t like the idea with big tiles, so I can see only 5-7 history items on my 32” monitor.\n3. Full content preview for each clipboard item.\n4. Quick search functionality.\nSo, I created ClipBook for my own use. After months of development, daily use, and positive feedback from my colleagues, I decided to share it publicly. It’s free. All data is securely stored on your computer. I’m planning to make it open source as well.\nIf you try it out, please let me know if you found it useful, if you have anything you’d like me to add, or if you have any other feedback.\nHappy to answer any questions. Much appreciated.\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40648404\nPoints: 36\n# Comments: 21",

          "description": "Hey HN, we're building Thread (https://thread.dev/) an open-source Jupyter Notebook that has a bunch of AI features built in. The easiest way to think of Thread is if the chat interface of OpenAI code interpreter was fused into a Jupyter Notebook development environment where you could still edit code or re-run cells. To check it out, you can see a video demo here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jq1_eoO6w-c\nWe initially got the idea when building Vizly (https://vizly.fyi/) a tool that lets non-technical users ask questions from their data. While Vizly is powerful at performing data transformations, as engineers, we often felt that natural language didn't give us enough freedom to edit the code that was generated or to explore the data further for ourselves. That is what gave us the inspiration to start Thread.\nWe made Thread a pip package (`pip install thread-dev`) because we wanted to make Thread as easily accessible as possible. While there are a lot of notebooks that improve on the notebook development experience, they are often cloud hosted tools that are hard to access as an individual contributor unless your company has signed an enterprise agreement.\nWith Thread, we are hoping to bring the power of LLMs to the local notebook development environment while blending the editing experience that you can get in a cloud hosted notebook. We have many ideas on the roadmap but instead of building in a vacuum (which we have made the mistake of before) our hope was to get some initial feedback to see if others are as interested in a tool like this as we are.\nWould love to hear your feedback and see what you think!\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40633773\nPoints: 75\n# Comments: 28",

Finally got around to making it and I think it turned out pretty cool.\nIt’s a math search game that’s meant to help you practice your quick addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division skills.\nI’m hoping it’ll help people (even those like me who aren’t big on math) learn and increase their speeds.\n(There are also some settings you can enable to make the game harder)\nIf you try it out, please let me know if you found it fun, if you have anything you’d like me to add, or if you have any other feedback.\nAnd if you have any questions, I’d be happy to answer.\nMuch appreciated.\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40623877\nPoints: 92\n# Comments: 45",

I was really surprised and had very good attitude to use it.\n Actually, I did not many problems, maybe with Wine and Lutris, but I solved it really quick, so it wasn't big deal. \n I love Yay, this is so helpful and quicker than Pacman, makes same, but for me works pretty well. Not without reason seems really popular.\n And at the end this, no I don't comeback to Windows, I don't want to change to another distro, Arch especially with Gnome looks and works really well, I did want to make chance to KDE, but KDE in default looks too similar to Windows for me.\n So yeah it was a hard, but I already really love Linux.

          "description": "Was using Windows since I was 12 but about a month ago switched to daily driving kubuntu due to me being worried about what Windows was doing with my data (still have it dual boot cause SATs consider Linux cheating but rarely ever boot into it). \n I never really \"liked\" the experience of Windows tbh, the OS just felt confusing to me even after using it for many years. For example: I can right click to eject a USB stick but have to go to another menu to eject SSD's on Windows. Also so many ads even after just a fresh install. When I used Win10, I saw some candy crush ads on the start menu and Win11 had a ton of app promotions on it. Kubuntu as none of that. I didn't think stock Windows was that pretty and had to manually change each individual icon to make it look good. Customizing Windows was such a pain to do and I always felt more distracted than productive on it.\n But kubuntu, everything somehow feels easier than Windows. Customizing it is so easy and doesn't even require the command line to do so (unless it's more complex stuff like installing a dock). I can install widgets, change my icons, customize my cursor: all this in a streamlined menu. The middle click paste feature, albeit annoying at first, was such a game changer for coding. I feel so much more productive with it because things can get done faster. And all my drives can be ejected with right click instead of 2 different ways for each type. And Dolphin is such a great file manager and makes way more sense than whatever Windows has.\n My PC looks and feels the way I like it and makes me want to use it to get things done: this is how it should be! Before, I wanted to use Mac or wished iPads were powerful enough to code on and only used my pc when there wasn't a mobile option for certain tasks but now I'm happy with my laptop. Linux made me discover a side to PCs I never knew existed!\n    submitted by    /u/FleuramdcrowAJ  \n [link]   [comments]",

I switched because I just couldn't work with Windows anymore. Ads everywhere, they shove that stupid onedrive thing in my face every time I turn on my computer. Slow and unreliable. To be honest, even though there are a lot of problems with Linux, there hasn't been a day I regretted switching. One of the problems is using Linux with an Nvidia GPU.

Next, I installed Blender and it could use the RTX 3080 without further configuration. So far, so good.\n I was happy to see that Ubuntu still gives us the deb version of Gnome Extensions Manager. Several distros force a ~500 MB flatpak for just that which, for me, is a NO NO. Gimp and several other programs that I need are also still available as a non-snap version. YAY, more room for LLMs and SD models.\n Next, I installed the Battery Health Charging Gnome extension which worked as expected. I then moved the dock to the bottom, centred it and tweaked several Gnome settings.\n For me, 24.04 had problems shutting down and I am happy to say that this seems to be no longer an issue. After using the OS and rendering out some Blender scenes, I am quite impressed and will keep using it.\n https://cdimage.ubuntu.com/daily-live/current/\n UPDATE\n Just switched to zsh because I use it on the other computers.\n    submitted by    /u/fedorum-com  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "From PyPl.org:\n [Konsave is a] CLI program that will let you save and apply your Linux customizations with just one command! Konsave also lets you share your dot files to your friends in an instant! It officially supports KDE Plasma but it can be used on all other desktop environments too!\n From ME:\n I can't tell you how many times I jacked up my theme, editing my screen, applets, task manager, etc. Spend another 30-minutes trying to get back whatever it was I just screwed up. Well, those days are gone. If you haven't heard there's a nifty python program called konsave that can save your current \"theme\". There's several ways to install it, the konsave website tells you to use python -m pip install konsave to install it. That may work for you. For me on OpenSUSE I had to install python311-pipx using zypper then use the pipx tool (zypper in python311-pipx) to install Konsave. It's usage was the same: pipx install konsave.\n Once you install konsave you can save your current theme information, not just the theme but all the apps, icon locations, icons, cursors, sddm, wallpaper, all of the things that you have customized. Then you can mess around with new theme styles and if you realize you liked the old one better just konsave -a old-saved-theme and get back to where you were.\n Of note you need to be your desktop user, don't use su or sudo.\n If you knew about this, AWESOME. I didn't, and spent the last year without this wonderful tool!\n    submitted by    /u/CryGeneral9999  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hey all! This is my first time posting here, but I've come and gone from the Linux world for a long time. Primarily, I'm a Mac user, but I've always kept Windows around as a compatibility option, and I even dual booted my gaming rig with Ubuntu back in the mid to late 2010s. Well more recently, I've had to switch to Mac more exclusively since a lot of the software I'm most comfortable with for my creative pursuits (podcasting, video editing, etc.) is Mac only (I know there are alternatives to Garageband and iMovie, but they're what my brain likes, and I've learned not to fight that lest I spend more time fighting with new software than creating). I've also been really dismayed by Microsoft's bullshittery these days re: AI and privacy and security. So with an eye to getting away from Windows wherever I can, I decided to dust off my old 2012 Mac Mini, wipe it, and install Ubuntu 24.04 LTS instead. I've then set it up so that its hooked up side by side my M1 Mac Mini on a different HDMI port, with easily swappable peripherals between them. The end result is having both my Mac, and a Linux machine at my disposal whenever needed. This allows me to spend most of my time in macOS, while also being able to easily switch to Ubuntu for gaming of a certain older vintage thanks to the excellent work Valve has done with Proton in Steam. All in all, I'm really impressed with my new setup, and how Linux has basically totally revived and breathed new life into this aging 2012 i5 Mini.\n I present to you, the setup I've affectionately taken to calling the MacStac!\n https://preview.redd.it/cu9e4okdax9d1.jpg?width=2783&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=4ae86322d14ce3da700e1e6d66c059a77fb37511\n    submitted by    /u/Merdy1337  \n [link]   [comments]",

There was a post on this community that said it’s a good test to take for broadening understanding of various OSs and computers in general.\n My background is predominantly military and emergency services. \n Hopefully this post helps other people on the fence with taking it. Here’s what I did to pass: \n -Printed off the exam objectives from comp tia. \n -made a 3x5 flashcard for every topic using GPT4 to define the topics and relate the topics to windows OS. I made over 600 flashcards this week. ($20)\n -Used an app called IT security to drill questions. It gave me a question deck of 500 questions I paid for this service and answered all 500 questions. ($20)\n I had a raspberry pi as my Linux computer that I would run commands through and learn how the commands work. ($100)\n I can say that I will never use Linux at work since I work in an environment that will never leave windows OS.

And they are all about the same: switching from windows. Not that I dislike newbies as I was one myself but it seems that one prediction from the post I mentioned will actually come true. A lot of those newcomers are probably gonna try, fail and ditch the OS for Windows.\n I say there should be a disclaimer on linux subreddits that Linux is not a substitute for Windows etc, because I feel bad for the guys who say basically the same stuff on every single one of those posts.\n Whether the market share will increase or not is yet know, but it doesn't look promising to me.

It is useful because efibootmgr is rather intimidating/annoying to use with very ugly looking output, IMHO. Particularly, if you are a distro hopper, efibootdude aims to help you clean up the mess.\n efibootdude is feature-wise comparable to Elinvention/efiboots: Manage EFI boot loader entries with this simple GUI. But eftbootdude is easier to install (if not in your distro's repo), is more transparent about what it is doing, and tries to report the mount point or device path of each boot loader (to make clean-up easier).\n To try if you wish ... install efibootmgr (if needed), pipx (if needed), and finally run pipx install efibootdude to install. And then run efibootdude with no arguments generally. It looks like this:\n efibootdude v0.5 screenshot\n efibootdude runs well on the systems I've tried (using python11 and python12), but there are a lot of weird BIOSes out there ;-) But, if not working so well for you, create an issue, say, provide the \"raw\" output of efibootmgr, your motherboard/BIOS, and a problem description so I can either generalize or add your case to the caveats ;-) Cheers.\n    submitted by    /u/ZetaZoid  \n [link]   [comments]",

I hope it's not too out of place.\n My dad was a huge linux geek(and computer fan in general) in the early days that it came out. It was his passion in life that he made into a successful career. So much so that while other fathers and sons were playing catch, he was showing me how to use Linux and Unix. I have many great memories of me and him bonding in front of a bash shell. I remember him telling everyone he saw(regardless of if they knew about linux or not) and acting like the proudest father alive when he taught me something as easy as how to cd into a directory when I was 6.\n I remember him religiously collecting stuffed penguins to add to his computer desk. There was a point where he had 10 scattered around and my mom complained that the work area was more penguin than desk. He was a goofy guy who managed to transfer his passions to me.\n Unfortunately, He got diagnosed with an early and aggressive form of dementia(frontotemporal) and ended up not being able to use computers anymore. He's been declining for years now and I've seen him go from the smartest person I've ever known to having the brain capacity of a newborn. He entered hospice two days ago and isn't expected to last much longer. Even through all of the deterioration, He still loves his stuffed penguin and has to have it near.\n I wanted to thank the community for always indulging him and sharing his same passion. This community was always the one that was the kindest to the goofy and eccentric guy who was my father. Truth be told, I can't even look at Linux right now without breaking down. I will in time though.\n    submitted by    /u/MyceliumJoe  \n [link]   [comments]",

The hardware is simply a modern descendant of workstation terminals. It is, for all intents and purposes, a \"terminal\".\n A younger friend insists that this hardware interface is an emulator using graphics and such, and the 'command line program' is a separate application of its own… Did I miss something?

          "description": "This week, we lost one of the great minds of our generation. Daniel dedicated the last 14 years of his life to creating an academic model for real-time threading. This work eventually led to the Linux Kernel runtime verification (RV), providing a practical use case for these models. He authored RTLA (Realtime Latency Analysis tool) that provides analysis of real-time performance and debugging based on models generated from RV. This marked a revolutionary approach to kernel debugging that relied on BPF and tracers to build live models of the current system state, as opposed to the historical method of black-box statically generated system states (i.e., kernel dumps and trace-cmd). \n While his work focused on real-time models, RV's reach expanded to general models of the stock Linux kernel (PREEMPT RT disabled) and successfully replaced tools like trace-cmd and, in some use cases, kdump. Today, I want to not only mourn the kernel legend that he had become but also the man himself. I had the honor of working with him, and the joy he brought into each and every room cannot be overstated. He blended a unique combination of compassion and genius that is rarely seen in the field of computer science, particularly at the level he reached. I will forever miss our casual fireside chats, our light-hearted debates about the best Prosecco drinks, and much, much more.

          "description": "We're all familiar with the use of 'dd' to write installers, the good old\n sudo dd if=installer.img of=/dev/sda2 bs=1M status=progress \n dance. It works, but it's not great:\n  \nThe progress info doesn't show progress as a percentage, nor does it calculate an ETA, it just shows bytes written.\n dd's default block size is a bad fit for most modern systems, hence the bs= parameter.\n It's easy to forget status=progress, and including it every time is a bit annoying.\n  \nNow, dd doesn't do anything special: it just reads from one file and writes to another. Tools like pv and cat could do the exact same thing. The only reason people really use dd for this purpose is that you can run dd as root, whereas redirecting the output of cat or pv requires running the shell itself as root. sudo dd ... is more terse than sudo sh -c 'cat ...'.\n A few weeks ago, I got annoyed with dd and implemented a --output option to the excellent tool called pv (\"Pipe Viewer\"). This meant that I could write images using sudo pv -o /dev/sda2 ... instead of using dd.\n Well, a week ago, PV released version 1.8.10 which contains my --output feature! Once your distribution updates to the latest version, you too can use pv instead of dd. Here are some advantages:\n  \npv shows an actual progress bar and an ETA, rather than just bytes written.\n pv automatically detects optimal buffer sizes.\n pv is more terse, since there is no need to specify status=progress or bs=....\n  \nTo ue pv instead of dd, simply run:\n sudo pv installer.img -Yo /path/to/block/device \n (The -Y is useful because it causes pv to sync after every write. This avoids the issue where the transfer hangs for a long time at 100% as buffers are flushed to the drive. -Yo is a nice mnemonic to remember :))\n Screenshot\n    submitted by    /u/mort96  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I, as many others, have been frustrated with the state of Wayland on Nvidia. Though, I admit things are getting better and hopefully 560 will be a big step in the right direction. Due to this frustration, I decided I would try to do something about it which led me down the rabbit hole of hybrid graphics.\n Traditionally, hybrid graphics is used on laptops for power-saving reasons. The laptop uses the iGPU for lightweight workloads and offloads to the dGPU when necessary. That said, there's no reason why we shouldn't be able to do the same on desktop.\n After about 3 hours of trial and error, bios tweaking, driver installation, tinkering with /etc/environment and /etc/profile and even tweaking some kernel modules, I succeeded. There was a single process running X11 in the background that took…",

After a lot of work I have finally compiled my first ISO file for it. I'd really like to hear your thoughts on how I could improve it as it is still very experimental and of course, needs some refinement.\n The GitHub is found below.

          "description": "On Linux AFAIK the only filesystems (for consumer use) that have transparent disk compression are zfs, btrfs, bcachefs - all of which are CoW. The 'regular' fs options like ext4/xfs lack this feature. (f2fs has compression but its disabled and you won't see any space saved)\n There should be no technical reason why something as simple as compression should be tied to CoW/snapshot capability. Its simply (de)compressing data as its written/read. e.g. NTFS on Windows does this.\n Is there a reason for this apart from historical? e.g etx4 and xfs are both quite old - xfs predates Linux in fact. Perhaps no one has felt the need to add this feature to them because alternatives exist?\n This is a real shame because with modern cpus and lzo/zstd, compression can make a real difference not only in space saved but ssd/hdd health, and there's no way to use it with the most used default fs on desktop (ext4) or server (xfs).\n    submitted by    /u/ECrispy  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Greetings,\n I have started using Linux since May 31st. I haven't really done a careful research in order to choose a distro, I just found Ubuntu Budgie and flashed into my desktop PC. I was really surprised, I expected Linux to be overwhelming and complicated, but it really wasn't, and in fact I have more fun using Linux than Windows 11.\n Then I went to  and I tried to rice my poor Budgie and I ended up making up a mess. But no problem I didn't have important files or sensitive data, so in order to fix everything I went on another distro, Xubuntu.\n I have been using Xubuntu since the 3rd of June, and so far I've been enjoying it, I noticed that I'm relying less and less on the file explorer and more on the terminal, I love using the terminal.\n A distro that caught my eye btw, was Arch. Not only because you can rice endlessly and customize how you want, but because I like seeing people using it. It looks minimalistic, simple and efficient. I also did some research on the AUR and how it keeps packages up to date better than APT on ubuntu.\n I also heard that using Arch will teach you how an OS works more in-depth, and since computer science interests me I think it would be a good source of learning.\n With that said I want to clarify what do I use and what is my purpose :\n I have 12GB of RAM, AMD RX 580, I use my PC mainly for browsing, productive work such as programming, taking notes, coding etc... I do little to no gaming and I'm really curious about learning new stuff in the OS, GNU/Linux world.\n Tell what should I know before installing Arch, advices , tips, feel free to interact and thanks in advance !\n    submitted by    /u/DonCABASH  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I've always loved Linux. Even before I fully switched, I was largely using Debian in WSL. Since I have switched though, I've heard a concerning large amount of people complain that whenever they post a question on a forum, particularly about arch btw, they tend to get answers telling them to read the f*cking manual. I find this interesting, because I actually disagree that this is a problem - if anything I would say it's a good thing. The issue is, new Linux users often post questions about common problems before even spending more than a minute searching Google, which causes a huge amount of duplicate posts all asking the same question, when they could have already found a number of people with the same issue online. This significantly brings down the quality of these forums, especially when many distributions have some truly amazing documentation - but for what, if nobody reads it? I think it's perfectly fine to ask something online on a forum, but only if you've first actually tried solving it yourself actively for more than 10 minutes.\n Change my view.\n (i use arch btw)\n EDIT: Typo fix\n    submitted by    /u/JakeStBu  \n [link]   [comments]",

It's therefore possible to get the latest upstream release even if you're on, let's say, Debian Ancient Stable.\n On top of that, even \"LTS\" releases of non-rolling distros provide up-to-date kernels these days. Ubuntu, for example, provides their hardware enablement stack, which is enabled by default, meaning that even if you stick with an LTS release you still get the latest kernel every 6 months when the non-LTS release does their kernel freeze.\n What, then, remains for the rolling distros from the perspective of the consumer-user?

Removing background noise from my mic based on a noise profile, it's so perfect, it works so perfectly! https://github.com/lucianodato/noise-repellent\n It is basically a replacement to reafir substract mode. It can get your noise profile, which should just be background noise, and remove it.\n I find this to be a lot more straightforward to do on Windows, for now, at least based on the way I do it currently. On Linux, Carla can look overwhelming, it was actually easier and faster to me but it does look much worse.\n Anyways, an amazing Linux win here. Only problem? Not a single tutorial tells you about this. Not a single source. I figured this out on my own, I mean google told me about noise repellent (prompt: linux reafir) but I figured out on my own that this confusing tutorial on reaplugs on linux I saw a thousand years ago used carla and I said \"maybe Carla helps\" without knowing a single thing about it, and I figured it out from there. Easyeffects also helped because their plugin showed up in Carla and I used it as guidance.\n Loving noise repellent. Wonderful work, and I guess it's smarter because it prefers to reduce noise instead of completely remove it (you can still remove it). I don't know if that's smarter.\n IMPORTANT: If you use Carla and maybe Ardour, your noise profile won't be saved. You need to build it yourself and merge pull request #119. Also, if you break easyeffects like I did, just reset the settings. Also, maybe keep a clean profile of carla saved in case you break something\n I hope there is an easier way to implement this, if not now in the future. Currently, I can't find it if I tell google \"linux remove background noise\", it only tells me of RNNoise and alternatives which work so badly in my case I rather not use it\n    submitted by    /u/patopansir  \n [link]   [comments]",

In a week (if it doesn't break :D), I'll share my experience with you all. Here's what I'll cover:\n  \nWhat I Liked About Manjaro\n What I Disliked About Manjaro\n Did I Like It More Than Arch?\n Did Anything Break?\n How Was the Community Support?\n Were There Any Must-Have Features or Tools?\n Overall Impression and Usability\n  \nI'll keep track of my daily experiences and issues (if any). If you have any tips, suggestions, or things to watch out for, please let me know. Looking forward to sharing my journey with you all!\n    submitted by    /u/ignxcy  \n [link]   [comments]",

I'm a junior developer so I constantly need to install different packages in my system. Occassionally I come across issues like can't install, dependencies not found, mirror not found etc. In manjaro sometimes I used to install packages using it's gui software downloader, sometimes using googling commands pacman, yay etc. Whenever I stuck I google the issue, go through manjaro forum, sometimes the solution works, sometimes partially and occassionally break some other dependencies etc. Same happened with debian based OS as well. Many times basic apps aren't available for particular distro like I couldn't find a working app for wordpress installer like local-wp. Many times application doesn't show up in menu themselves after installation, you need to make them executable, create desktop files . So am I doing something in wrong way ? After sometime like 1 year , things become so messy inside my machine that I don't remember what I did last time while installing some random packages that it broke the system now. Please share your experience, and suggest me some workaround for managing packages be it debian or arch. \n    submitted by    /u/noobLinuxuser950  \n [link]   [comments]",

The only perf concern I read about is it used to have higher cpu usage for updating metadata but I believe thats been fixed and no longer relevant?\n (I think for most users, performance in benchmarks may not be noticeable and other features matter more, but its still an important consideration)\n SSD/OS installs - XFS is almost as fast as f2fs for these.

I was literally running a VM with a full operating system and running chrome with a ton of tabs open plus running vscode with a project open and my fan wasnt even on!! It was amazing. Plus for development purposes this has just been amazing . Gaming has also been really good with protondb, with most games simply starting from steam. without much/any tinkering and my 3050 hasn't had any issues so far.\n For anyone considering jumping ship just do it.

Out of curiosity, I separated a small partition so that I could test whether I could even install it and use it for a few days, and a day later I decided to format my entire second drive (~500gb) on which I only had a few games and so far I have no reason to go back to Windows! Really, every application I wanted to go/install worked, there are so many guides and videos on YouTube explaining how to do various things.\n I can understand that some people may not like the fact that sometimes you have to type something into the console, but for me it's not a big deal to learn a dozen commands. I really see that this is a great community and the openness of the system is wonderful!\n I even told a friend to take a look at Linux, but he's not too interested, even after I showed him that it's a really cool system. However, I understand him, no one likes change if they feel comfortable.\n I really think that there is almost no effort (even Arch, which I installed , people said it might be quite difficult for a first Linux, but I really don't feel it)!\n I wanted to write my story and say Hello to the great community, I'm glad I found myself here!

After a short search i found out hundreds of different threads and articles recommending stow for managing dotfiles, even for my specific scenario - using it with Ansible.\n After trying to use it and checking it's man pages i found out that while it looks great, in real life scenario is completely useless for managing dotfiles:\n Lets say i am setting up a new computer and i want to sync my config from Syncthing. Before running a stow, i need to manually mv the sync'd config (because there are already files like ZSH or GTK config in my home folder) from the Syncthing to my home folder, then adapt it in stow and only then i can play with stow. The thing is, that once i already mv my sync'd config to a new home folder, i no longer need stow. Of course there are cases where the saved config changes and i want to sync it with other machines, but those configs are not changing that often, besides if i have an Ansible script which is mv my saved config to live home folder, i can just run it again? Seems that stow here is just an additional step, which at the end of the day is completely unnecessary?

Are there any new updates or developments about Newton?\n I snooped around GNOME's GitLab and apparently only one person named Matt Campbell is actively working on Newton, the creator of Newton. There's still relatively new commits, but I'm not really good at reading code so I'm not exactly sure what's the latest changes that landed on Newton's codebase.

I decided I wanted to learn about 'hacking' without a computer and that's when I discovered termux a linux emulator on android.\n I didn't even care I downloaded scripts when I saw a term for a person like me (script kiddie ) I decided I didn't have to be looked down upon. then I saw Kali Linux but I couldn't do anything since I didn't have a laptop and my parents thought it was 'useless' for a highschooler . I decided to learn about Linux, python and C while still using a phone although it was hard.\n After sometime I found it hard to concentrate on two things so I left termux for my studies and after finishing highschool I got my laptop. The second day I installed Debian since termux was based on It. I fucked up the installation and figured things out after some months I started distro hopping when I decided to keep using fedora for sometime.\n After using Linux as my first real OS I think I can safely say to new users Linux isn't hard if you can use Google and read manuals. Just decide your leaving Windows close the door and don't turn back, everything is hard when you compare it to something. The way you feel about Linux I feel the same about windows but that doesn't mean when my parents ask me why their windows machine has a problem I will say I don't know about windows when they bought me a laptop I've been using for a year.\n Sorry guys for this boring story.\n    submitted by    /u/Caultor  \n [link]   [comments]",

(that I am involved in) It's called Oreon Linux, an AlmaLinux/RHEL based distro that offers a very user friendly interface that makes it easy to learn Linux on a long term supported foundation. Oreon currently has a small team of developers. Oreon's main goal aside from user friendliness is to provide a selection of packages that either don't function or even exist in other RHEL distros. Oreon has fully functional gaming support under Proton/WINE, which never worked on EL.\n Oreon has been actively maintained for 5 months now and supports each release for 10 years. Every few months there are feature updates pushed out, providing new packages, apps, and UI changes. The next feature update is in September, and will include a few more packages, along …",

          "description": "Hi guys, I just started a new job here in Germany and after completing my studies, I got into DevOps as a junior. I really love the networking world and I was already motivated to be in the Linux world than Windows. Our team leader gave us new members (me more 3 other colleagues), a few exercises about docker, ansible, jenkins, and other technologies to explore. I am struggling a lot with learning these technologies and I see that my colleagues are going way better than me (they are figuring out things faster and understanding the concepts). For example, ansible seems to be very \"easy\" to learn as everyone says and from what I read about it but for me has been very confusing. I am very sure that I am the problem and I notice a lot of lack of focus from my side, is not I am putting in lower hours, I actually put in more after work but has been a real struggle for me and after the day, this is killing my head together with my normal anxiety. I was on the Ansible documentation official website and seems so confusing to understand how things work, the same happened in Docker and Jenkins so I know that I am the problem and not the documentation itself. I really think these technologies are very good and a few things I was able to figure it out but has been so hard to my head, like the conceptions and the functionalities of those techs. Am I just really dumb? It will pass after a while or will I keep on this until I give up permanently? I think ansible is the tech that really made me think if this networking world was for me because everyone seems to use it very easily and I am struggling a lot. Well, I hope some of you can share your experiences and give me some ideas. I am on meds after having few panic attacks in the last months and I don't want to have that as an excuse to make this \"normal\" not being able to learn these things more easily. I appreciate if you guys took some time to read this, means a lot to me. Thanks!\n    submitted by    /u/Alive-Zucchini-3377  \n [link]   [comments]",

They care a lot about details and improving the user experience and interaction by identifying what new users are having problems with and trying to make the system welcoming to them. They really listen to feedback and improve. With the 17.1 version, they enhanced by a lot the usability of Windows Programs. For example, nice warnings that say \"This app isn't native to Linux, you can try some alternatives or the compatibility layer\" like recommending Heroic launcher when the user tries to run the Epic executable or automatically putting the program in Bottles.\n I would point out the main page for the Pro edition. In the Why pay page, they state that \"Zorin OS will always be free and open. We want to reward and celebrate those who support our mission, which is why we created Zorin OS Pro\", but it isn't very clear in other places that it's possible to have the same experience in ZorinOS Pro or Core.

          "description": "So, I was thinking about CC licenses the other day as I generally distribute my photos under CC BY-NC-SA 4.0. This absolutely and completely prohibits OpenAI (ClosedAI lol) from using my photos in training as they are mostly a for profit corp. At the same time, if we are considering a community developed open source model, NC clause doesn't apply any more. With the BY everything is also clear\n The SA (same alike license) part seems to be much more interesting in this case. It is because the photos produced by the model are most definitely derived from my photos and therefore must be distributed under the same or compatible license. Model's architecture, on the other hand, wasn't derived from my photos and therefore use whatever license it wants. Although here things become tricky as, at least as I understand it, the architecture is usually tied with the weights, that are tuned on my photos and, therefore, likely fall under a category of derived work\n Now we have a problem, as (likely) the whole model will need to use CC BY-NC-SA 4.0 or something compatible with it. As far as I'm concerned, there are no licenses compatible with my exact CC license and the CC is not recommend for software\n I think that it is a problem as openai pretty much doesn't care about that (and if it did, removing any part of the CC license can probably allow them to exploit it), while for fair developers of AI it makes content such as mine pretty much inaccessible, therefore benefiting the giant corps\n The only solution to the issue I see is to make a dedicated open license for AI as well as a revision to CC to insure compatibility and clarify such highly speculative points as what pars of models are actually considered derivatives\n Anyway, I want to be clear that I'm neither a lawyer nor a developer and I have never researched this topic in-depth.

          "description": "Hi, I updated my Pixel 8 Pro to the 5/06/24 update of android 14. However when I did this, my SIM card was no longer being read. I am on Three UK and the anywhere in the settings where the SIM card was mentioned or network was mentioned was greyed out. I tried a bunch of solutions.\n This included:\n  \nRestarting the device multiple times\n Resetting the network settings\n Turning the device off for the day (I thought it might have been an overheating issue)\n  \nNothing worked, so I decided to flash the device with Googles browser flashing service. I tried the other latest build, AP2A.240605.024.A1, but I had the same issue. I almost gave up but then I thought to try the previous Android14 build that was on the 8 Pro, AP1A.240505.005.B1. This worked! I can use my network again on my Pixel 8 Pro. I will raise this as a bug with Android. I thought to post here also just in case other people were having the same issue.

After 10 years at Ars Technia I'm done writing. I you've ever read anything of mine, thanks.\"\n Anyway, it's a big shame as Ron fearlessly held Google and co accountable, and over that 10 years mercilessly beat brands to death for substandard efforts. He famously started here in r/Android and worked his way up.\n It's the end of an era in some ways. The days of Android/iOS being interesting enough to do massive reviews and deep dives is over. Android and iOS are not boring but it's no longer wildly interesting to see what's coming next. At Google, Dave Burke who headed up Android for 14 years is moving to \"AI/bio\". \n Guys from the early Android era have largely left: Dieter Bohn is at Google now, Ron is leaving, David Ruddock left Android Police a few years ago to do something (I forget what) and is in Germany working elsewhere, Kris Carlon and lots of the Android Authority OGs have moved on - too many to name - but the long experienced and often very critical journalists/writers/analysts have left for other, hopefully greener pastures.\n No one is irreplaceable but some of the most trusted names, who know all of the good and bad, and didn't shy away from calling it out, are gone.

I have NEVER seen people with so many issues with apple id as our family has within the last few months. What really pissed me off was the fact that I could not use my iPad to color and listen to music for my anxiety. I was walking around in circles at my house like a nut. Everything was activation locked. I was really pissed off. I contacted my carrier who was nice enough to apply a credit on all three and let me return it and then sent me new android devices. I had explained I never had an issue being locked out of Google for 15 years. All you need is your phone number and a family members added to multi factor and voila you're back in. You literally have to wait at least from a week to a month to get back in. It's stupid. \n    submitted by    /u/Amazing-Divide3286  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Howdy, Reddit!\n A little while ago I wrote a simple power consumption benchmark for Android web browsers, called browser-power-hour. I've since used it to test Chrome against Firefox on two different devices, and I'm here to share the results!\n Why is this useful? It's pretty common to see battery drain brought up as a reason to use (or avoid) certain web browsers, often without evidence. But browsers are complex and constantly evolving pieces of software... maybe those perceptions are out of date? Maybe they're still valid! Unlike raw performance, there are few, if any, good ways to reliably measure battery impact for an individual app, especially on Android, so it's hard to tell what's actually true. Hence, this project! My goal is to be able to provide objective metrics on browser power…",

          "description": "I'm curious what others are using as I'm looking to upgrade my watch to one that would pair well with an Xperia 1 V. I have used Fossil watches for the last few years but they've exited the smartwatch market and their watches were pretty meh but they were at least independent of any particular phone (like how the Galaxy Watch is meant to pair with Samsung devices). I've been eyeing the OnePlus watch since it's the best looking of the 3 main options available (Samsung, Google, OnePlus) but was also looking at the Tic Watch for it's long battery. All I really use my watch for is counting steps and dealing with notifications (bonus points if I can control my alarm app from the watch). So what's everyone using?\n    submitted by    /u/-Arkham  \n [link]   [comments]",

I just wanted to point this out because on every iPhone video, whenever the creator shows off the iPhone’s camera, not even stating a single name of Android, Android users just come and bash the comments with “Oh this S24…”, “S24:…” “S24 better…” etc. However, when people show off their S24 (or any android) camera, iPhone users never comment on them, and they just respect it. May I know why this is the case for majority and why Android users hate on Apple users? Why do Apple users have more calmness than majority of Android users?

          "description": "现象\n最近 CDN 平台下，每天都有新增数十个不同用户的域名受到来自山西太原联通的几个固定 IP 网段的刷流量攻击。\n每天 20:00 左右开始，23:00 准时结束。\n攻击者会事先人为挑选体积较大的静态文件，例如音视频 mp4 、安装包 exe/apk 、体积较大的图片等，然后在攻击期间，不断请求这个文件，消耗流量。\n攻击者会将请求的 Referer 头设置为文件链接本身，User-Agent 则有时是随机的，有时为空。\n其实数月前就有体量较大的用户遇到这个问题，我们封死之后消停了一会儿，\n但最近开始无差别攻击，大站小站只要被它扫到的站，都会在这个时间段内开始高频请求。\n分析\n攻击者似乎并不想要将网站打死，而是慢慢地刷流量，每个域名刷的流量也不多，3 个小时内最多几百 GB 。\n一开始我们以为是普通的竞对行为，后来发现互联网上有蛮多类似案例反馈，来自不同 CDN 厂商平台，在 V2EX 上也看到几个类似的帖子：\nhttps://v2ex.com/t/1055422#r_14960872\nhttps://v2ex.com/t/1045318\n可以认为这个是一个比较广泛的现象。\n另外我们分析这些被攻击的网站的日志，发现攻击开始前的几天内，都会出现一个 153.101.*.* 的 IP （江苏联通） ，使用 Java/1.8.0_91 的 User-Agent 访问被攻击的网站里的资源，我们不确定这是否与攻击有关，但也没查到这是哪家的爬虫信息，也没搜到过前人关于这个 IP 的日志，如果你也遇到了这个攻击，可以检查下日志。\n猜测\n攻击者没有把哪个网站当成必须要拿下的目标，甚至你把它 IP 屏蔽之后，它也不在乎，仍旧到点继续刷同一个地址，即使这个地址会被拦截...\n根据时间、攻击者行为特征，我感觉与 省间结算政策 或者该政策推开后运营商加速封杀高上传家宽（比如 PCDN 之类的）有关系。\n至于到底是运营商自身拉平省际带宽差距的需要，还是政策导致的高上传家宽用户需要拉低上传下载比例来避开运营商的封杀？\n我感觉是后者，观察日志发现，攻击者大部分情况下，请求的还是山西联通网内的 CDN 节点，这是达不到拉平省际带宽差异的效果的。\n为什么要广撒网拿中小网站下手？我感觉是怕流量过于集中引起对方报警之类的，这样每个网站 1~200 GB 分摊下来，对于单个网站主来说，损失不大也不好立案。\n本段所述只是我个人的猜测，未经证实，也未有其它证据佐证，仅供参考。\n应对\n我们监控到异常的 CDN 域名后，会主动屏蔽相关 IP 访问，你也可以尝试屏蔽下列 IPv4 网段：\n221.205.168.0/23\n60.221.231.0/24\n211.90.146.0/24\n\n后续不知道会不会更换 IP ，但如果上述的猜测正确，攻击者自己频繁更换 IP 应该是不利于他所要实现的目的的。\n另外，CDN 端开启限流措施，例如 IP 访问频率限制、流量封顶限制等访问控制功能，也是非常有必要的，可以有效减少恶意攻击产生的流量，也能在发生攻击后尽快提醒你做出应对。",

          "description": "简单来说，就是选定的应用走特定的路由表，达到指定出口的效果，连防火墙规则都不用配置。简单到只需要几个字符的简短命令即可做到。\n比如，我可以在一台 FreeBSD 机器连接上 Cloudflare Warp ，连接时“改道”至副路由表（假设是1 号表）。连接完成后，WireGuard 会在副路由表中把默认路由指向 Cloudflare Warp 的 IP 。这样一来，其它程序都会不会受到影响，继续按照主路由表（即 0 号表）的规则通讯。\n如何使指定程序走 Cloudflare Warp 通道呢？我要 ping 命令走该通道，只需前面加一条 setfib 命令即可：\nsetfib 1 ping -c 10 8.8.8.8\n\n就这么简单。现在 ping 程序就从 Cloudflare Warp 通道出去了。各种联网程序都可以这样做。\n对于开机自启的服务程序，也可以使它们走副路由表。只需要编辑 rc.conf ，给对应程序添加_fib=1后缀即可。就像这样：\nsomesocks_enable=\"YES\"\nsomesocks_fib=1\n\nWireGuard 除外，需要编辑 wg*.conf 加一行 Table = 1 才可以。\n注意：需要先启用 FIB 。\n默认情况下，FreeBSD 只会提供单个路由表，想要启用副路由表就必须自行启用。步骤很简单：\n打开 /boot/loader.conf ，加入一行：\nnet.fibs=2\n\n重启系统。\n现在，0 号表就是默认路由表，我称之为主路由表。其它编号的就是副路由表。\n想要多少个路由表，数值就写多少。只要有需要，net.fibs=100都可以。\n我利用这个特点在 VPS 上连接了 Cloudflare Warp ，将*ray/ss 的流量改成走 Cloudflare Warp 通道，而自己的中转程序继续走默认路由表，达到入口 IP 和出口 IP 都不同的效果：\n利用 FreeBSD 主副路由表(FIB)在服务器使用 Cloudflare Warp\n在这个基础上可以延伸出更灵活的做法，比如同时连上多个 wireguard 隧道，多个 ss 分别走对应的通道，每个 ss 监听不同的端口，中转程序连接不同的端口即可实现动态切换出口位置。比起单路由表+策略路由，这样做的灵活度高了很多。\nPS: 中转程序不一定必须是我链接里的那个，也可以是其它转发程序",

          "description": "原文发布在我的网站上\n难以复刻的大问题\n第一个麻烦是现代框架解决的是“大”问题，而个体开发者遇不上“大”问题\n早些年如果你想从头学习一门前端框架，比如 BackboneJS 或者 EmberJS ，一定绕不开从构建一款 Todo 应用开始，它能让你直观感受到 model 与 view 之间是如何相互协作的。现在我们依然保留同样的传统，只不过它不在以 Todo 的形式存在，但依然会出现在文档的 Quick Start 小节中，企图用最少代码最大程度上展现技术的特性。\n问题在于早些年前端代码只是作为静态站点点缀般的存在，例如控制交互，填充内容——看看这段淘宝平台 09 年的代码你就会理解我在说什么。而如今 JavaScript 代码已经可以做到接管编译、路由、渲染，将应用端到端的呈现出来。最重要的是，它已将处理复杂问题的能力内置其中。然而这些复杂问题，从高并发到匪夷所思的业务场景，Quick Start 里的 demo 无法展现它们的全貌，个体也难以模拟。\nK8S 就是一个最好的例子。\n去年抱着学习的心态，我把我所有部署在 VPS 上的 side project 迁往 K8S ，甚至连应用的部署方式也替换为了 ArgoCD 。但实话实话这不是一笔划算的买卖，因为从结果上看，替换为 K8S 之后花费的计算资源更贵了，维护成本（脑袋里需要记住的东西、涉及到的步骤和需要持续维护的环境）也水涨船高。原因在于当架构简单到仅需单个 cluster 就足以支撑的时候，K8S 的边际成本无法被均摊。所以吊诡的事情出现了，你发现体感上新款 K8S 还不如旧款 PM2 好用。\n可不可以不关心大问题，全权委托给框架，我只管把 kubectl 命令全文背诵就好？——不行，因为 Copilot 永远记得比你滚瓜烂熟。面对 AI 的挑战，程序员无可避免的要将角色从执行者转变为决策者。\n说起来有些玄学，设计…",

          "description": "我应该去年发过一个帖子，主要讨论的是这几年一直在用公司配发的 Thinkpad 笔记本，不敢再将自己的笔记本带到公司去用。原因很简单，现在的企业监控软件实在是太厉害，比如深信服客户端，连微信聊天记录都能监控到，还有定时截屏等等功能\n其实当时还有另外一个很重要的因素没说，那就是钱的问题。\n现在大环境不好，我在我现在的公司呆了四年多了，也就从一个底层员工混到一个业务线研发负责人，最近三年时间里，部门就招了一个新人，没有人离职。\n就业行情真的是太差了，四年多时间里，我自己曾经投过不少简历出去但就面试过两次，一次挂了一次嫌弃地方远没去，仔细说来也基本算没地方可以去了。然后在自己这家公司里，干了四年多，工资也只在去年涨了一千五而已。\n现在的这个行情，我还能继续呆在现在的公司干几年，不好说，但我知道不管是职位还是工资，也基本是到头了。\n因为现在大家都不愿意动，岗位非常的稳定，所以工资也就十分的稳定。甚至因为大环境导致市场缩水，公司这两年做项目也是十分的保守，前几年项目接到手软，我们加班也非常多，但是这两年项目就很稳定，做完这一个才做下一个，加班也很少了。就是这样稳定的情况下，我觉得自己再去投资一台高配电脑，提升自己的工作效率是一件不划算的事情。\n当然了，我自己其实也是一个非常懒的人，下班回家再忙工作或者提升自己再或者自己接私活什么的，也是从来没有考虑的。年龄也大了，没有年轻时的那种冲劲，下班回家就想葛优瘫。\n除了玩游戏就是刷视频看电影。所以我家里使用的电脑就是一台丐版 macmini,接电视当电视盒子用的。曾经还发帖说 8G 内存的 Mac 很好用结果被一堆人喷。\n所以高配 Mac 对我来说基本就是毫无需求。\n我还记得 14 年的时候，我斥资 9 千买下了人生第一台 MacBookpro ，2013late 款，坚信这是一笔非常划算的投资，如今高配 Mac 已然来到了 2 万价位，依然还有很多人在做着这样的投资。\nå2 万其实谁都能拿得出来，但是真正愿意做这种投资并且坚信是值得的，也算是一种本事吧，至少我现在没有这种本事了。",

          "description": "做外包，最近遇到个异想天开的甲方，想预测彩票数字。该甲方自称潜心研究彩票 30 年，一直手算，现在觉得数据量太大了，想用程序实现。\n虽然这个甲方在我看来是异想天开，但是他提出的计算规则倒是没有漏洞，我本着反正只谁出钱谁上帝的原则，实现了出来，但是现在遇到了性能问题。\n他的算法并不复杂，首先，甲方提供了 75 个数字字符串，每个字符串都是 4 个数字，诸如 0123 3578 之类的。我在这里称其为样本数据。\n彩票的开奖数字，每期都是 5 位数字，它的算法里，把这 5 位数字拆开成 5 个，每个单独去和 75 个样本数据进行计算。\n一个样本字符串 + 开奖拆开的数字，会生成一系列值，这些值我接下来会有详述，这就是一行记录(每个生成的值是一列)。\n因为有 75 个字符串，所以就有 75 行，于是，一个被拆开的数字，会生成一张表格，这张表格有 75 行。\n又因为每期开奖数字是 5 位，所以每期彩票的开奖数字最后都会有 5 张表。\n生成值（表格的列）有以下部分：\nA1：找上一期的开奖数字，计算上一期的开奖数字是否在对应行样本数据中出现过。\nA2：当前开奖数字是否在样本数据中出现过？无论出现还是没出现状态，都从当前这期往之前的开奖记录回溯，如果状态和目前这期一致，就累加数值，直到出现一期和当前这一期不一样的状态，就终止(我大致看了一下平均遍历次数在 5 左右)。\nQ15B：从当前期倒退 61 期，然后从此为起点遍历 30 期，只要这 30 期的开奖数字，命中了对应的样本数据，就+1 ，然后获得最终值。如果之前的期数不够，则该数据无效\nQ15R：从当前期倒退 31 期，然后从此为起点遍历 30 期，只要这 30 期的开奖数字，命中了对应的样本数据，就+1 ，然后获得最终值。如果之前的期数不够，则该数据无效\nP15B：从当前期倒退 16 期，然后从此为起点遍历 15 期，要要这 15 期的开奖数字，命中了对应的样本数据，就+1 ，然后获得最终值。如果之前的期数不够，则该数据无效。\nP15R：从当前期倒退 31 期，然后从此为起点遍历 15 期，只要这 15 期的开奖数字，命中了对应的样本数据，就+1 ，然后获得最终值。如果之前的期数不够，则该数据无效，\nP15X：把前面的 A1 ，A2 ，Q15B Q15R P15B P15R 以一个简单的排列规则后得到的分类数。\nQ15X：就是上一期的 P15X （也就是把上一期的 P15X 算一遍出来，所以如果之前期数不够，那么这个数据算不出来\nC618：这是性能罪魁祸首，先不在这里算，问题在下面讲，先跳过。\n就此你可以看到，这个过程从 A1 到 P15R 往前遍历了 1 + 5 + 30 +30 + 15 +15 = 96 次。然后为了算出 Q15X ，又来了一遍，所以遍历了 192 次。问题是，这仅仅是一行（因为是和一个样本字符串在对比），而这个表有 75 行，于是这个循环对比的过程执行了 75 x192 = 14400\n然后我们每期开奖数字有 5 位，也就是说每期有 5 张这样的表，因此是 14400 x 5 = 72000 次。\n这个代码我用的语言是 Java 。循环 72000 次，每一次几乎都进行了对比运算和累加运算，对比运算很简单用的是字符串查找 indexOf 方法。根据我反复测试，程序在预热完毕完毕后，执行上述计算花费时间是 45-50 毫秒。\n45-50 毫秒也不算长啊。本来到这里还没太奇葩的，但是接下来甲方就有骚操作想法了。还记得前面写的那个 C618 吗？甲方的意思是，从目前的这期开奖记录开始，往前倒退 618 期，以此为起点，计算从此开始到当期为止（共 617 期）的从 A1 到 Q15X 的全部值。然后把这 617 的 A1 到 Q15X 和当前期的 A1 到 Q15X 按一定规则对比，比中了就累计值。\n于是上面那计算一次要 45-50 毫秒的操作，要算 617 次。。。算一次 30 秒就过去了。。。\n我想了很久，也没想到该怎么优化这个问题，这妥妥的是 CPU 密集型运算，但是它的算法规则不复杂，甚至可以说相当简单，除了向前追溯的次数太多了之外，整个运算过程几乎的规则就是对比和累计，对比的规则也就是要么查有没有，要么相等不相等。。。\n我一度想看看那个 72000 次花费 45-50 毫秒的过程有没有优化的空间，但是看来看去也不知道该优化哪里。\n目前我暂时不想考虑换语言之类的手段。\n有没有算法大佬来聊聊这个场景该怎么办呢？",

[Yes,/I'm -> Years/are] packed, but not quite ready. I can't find my passport. [Your -> ]    -\n [ -> You] passport? That's the one thing you [mustn't -> must/not] leave behind. I know. I haven't lost it. I've packed [it,/but -> it./But] I [can't -> cannot] remember [which/bag. -> what/it/is.]“\n中括号里的即为你念错的地方。\n\n我的使用方法：\n因为我日常都是去找四六级的听力去练习朗读，因此我下载了全套的历年四六级听力。（也因此需要剪切，每次用 ffmpeg 命令行也挺麻烦的）。\n1.该脚本会先针对你剪好的标准音频进行语音识别，得到文本打印下来。\n2.然后你只需要对着这个文本朗读即可。\n3.最后分析出你哪些地方读错了，哪些地方读的是正确的。\n我的初衷是想做完整朗读中每个单词提供发音百分比置信度的功能，但是当我做到一半的时候，开始写什么 MFCC 音频提取、DTW 算法匹配的时候，才意识到我其实是把简单问题复杂化了。\n日常生活中，大部分人都是不敢说，以及熟悉的单词不会念，能开口实际上就赢了大半，不至于说要每个单词都非常标准发音，这样反而会很奇怪。于是我觉得只要能大声朗读出能让机器识别出来的句子，就能够实现我的目标。至于需要聚焦到更细节的每个单词的严苛发音，我觉得随便一个背单词的 app 就能做到。\n我之前用 chatGPT 对话练习过，但是后面发现很多时候我并不是缺乏对话，而是缺乏开口念英语的连贯性、自然性。我单词都念错了，AI 还能跟我继续唠嗑。读书的时候英语早读课过于注重单个单词的记忆而忽略了完整文章的朗读。如果仅仅是需要找个对话练习，用 chatGPT 就够了。我个人认为这个脚本解决的痛点也是在于：连贯对话的口语纠错。\n\n本脚本也是为了抛砖引玉，肯定有体验更好的方案，希望有大佬如果有兴趣可以开发出来让我使用使用，我这个确实有点简陋。",

          "description": "第一次发帖，如果节点有错还请管理大大帮忙移动下\n先大概介绍下我使用的方案：\n  通过 RouterOS+Surge+SmartDNS 实现客户端无感知分流，ros 将指定客户端的 dns 请求劫持至 smardns ，smardns 对国内域名返回真实 ip ，分流域名返回 fakeip ，同时在 ros 上设置将 fakeip 段路由至 surge 网关，最终实现分流和代理。ros 上对 surge 网关进行监控，当服务异常时会自动关闭劫持。具体可以看我的折腾手记： https://dddafa.notion.site/RouterOS-Surge-SmartDNS-334831ae5792422796cca2f9d4f3ab8d\n为什么使用这个方案：\n  我是使用 apple 生态，surge 各端基本通用的配置文件自然成为了我的首选，一开始我是采用 surge 网关作为 DHCP 服务器后面变成 ros 对指定客户端下发 surge 配置。但本质没有变化。在使用 surge 网关中有一点小问题：\n1 、测速跑不满带宽上限，会低 50Mbps 左右 \n2 、上传测速会变成局域网速率(有可能是测速网的问题，我没有去深究) \n3 、考虑到 surge 网关挂掉的情况,虽然概率比较低但有发现过。 \n所以就开始研究一个更适合我需求的方案，最终发现 dns 分流很适合我，遂开始搭建，后面查阅相关文档发现 surge 网关模式下对所有域名都返回 fakeip ，虽然有 always-real-ip 参数，但貌似官方没有给这个参数引用文件的权限。所以加入 smartdns 作为查询服务器，经过几天的实际使用下来，非常稳定，即使网关挂了 也能自动的切换回正常 dns 不影响国内网站访问。\n不知道诸位坛友们有没疑问或者有什么更加优秀的方案，欢迎探讨",

          "description": "前两次拔牙都是拔完后医生嘱咐顶不住就吃消炎药和止疼药，药也压不住就来急诊或者复诊，这次我灵机一动，我干嘛不手术前就吃。\n于是 12 点多在北大口腔三院取完号后吃了布洛芬和阿司匹林。\n电锯/钻 滋滋作响磨着牙，感觉跟钓鱼佬铁锹挖蚯蚓一样掏啊掏，没有像前两次走出医院就开始逐渐发热、巨疼。分泌的口水血也明显没那么多了。\n坐两小时地铁回去，骑 20 分钟共享电动车，回单位上班跑报修。\n最大的遗憾是每次来看牙一面对医生就迷迷糊糊的，好些都没记住。\n网上一直有说拔牙对女医生不友好，力度不够的话反复拉扯，就算是打麻药了也顶不住这么造。但比较搞的是选择明日挂号看到的空余的都是女医生。好大夫在线、官网之类的能搜到对方信息。有号就挂了，这几天北京也不算特别热。\n右下的智齿横着长了，拍完片后付费上班的医学生没给我拔，只拔了右上的智齿。说下面智齿要先把漏出来的牙磨切掉再把肉下面的牙弄出来，因为靠近神经可能会导致这侧面部麻木，是个大活。他好像是在暗示我不能挂普通号让付费上班的高资带教医学生拔这个牙。\n对比了 A 北京口腔天坛院区普通号、B 北大口腔总院普通号、C 北大口腔三院医师号，觉得比较离谱的是，这三个地方的拔牙后注意事项居然有好几条不重合的。北京口腔天坛院区八个注意事项，北大口腔总院五个注意事项，北大口腔三院十个注意事项] 。\nhttps://imgur.com/a/nP7Rpqv\n没有重合的注意事项有：\n1. A 三日内避免拔牙测咀嚼;\n2. A 拔牙后遵医嘱吃消炎药止痛药，有 XX 情况去综合医院发热门诊消炎退热；\n3. C 拔牙后感觉有硬物存留，可能是残留的碎片或者牙槽骨外落巴拉巴拉；\n最震惊的是，北大口腔三院的医师问我带片子了吗，我说在北大口腔总院拍过你在系统查下，她说查不了。\n得亏我手机拍的有，不然又得重新拍片。\n比较搞的是 抽血验的时候，医生跟挤奶一样双手挤压手肘附近，加速血液流动。让我如临大敌，莫非我还贫血。\nA 电子化最落后，好些要人工，不能自助机挂号取号签到，交单子给分诊台工作人员人工派给医生。\nB 总院最爽，除了完事后得去人工窗口缴费再把一联给医生和取药，大部分都能自助机解决。当时我是牙周复诊，看时间还够就自助机现场挂号开始了第二次拔智齿牙。\nC 就两层，面积不大，不同科室找着不费劲，缺点就是只有二层有卫生间。\n下一步就是找机会做个综合检查看有没有啥隐患。我开始看牙是因为有几天周一侧牙龈肿了影响吃饭说话，硬抗了过去，结果发现牙龈鼓包消不下去，一两个月了还越来越大。 小红书搜了一圈不是买点药吃就能完事的，就去了北京口腔天坛院区，因为他们家有免费初筛，然后建议去看啥科室，最终确定先冲牙消肿解决智齿冠周炎，拔智齿，洗牙刮治割牙龈瘤，在拔智齿。\n各位老哥多关注牙齿卫生健康。",

          "description": "随着工作越来越忙，很少看剧了，最近看了一部《大明王朝 1566 》，又叫做《嘉靖与海瑞》，豆瓣评分 9.8 分。\n历史背景\n公元 1566 年是明朝时期，嘉靖皇帝嘉靖 45 年，这一年嘉靖皇帝去世，隆庆帝继位。\n嘉靖帝是明朝第 12 任皇帝，嘉靖这个年号是从 1522 年到 1566 年。历史上有名的道长皇帝，一生迷信道教，执着长生不老。同时在位期间，20 年不上朝，但是又暗中把持朝政，牢牢控制着朝廷的大权。\n有人说明朝的衰亡就是从他开始，也有人说是他造成了明朝的中兴，为后面的万历改革打下了基础。\n功过是非自有后人和史学家评论，不可否认的是他在位期间，朝廷出现了很多有名的大臣，如夏言，严嵩，严世蕃，徐阶，高拱，张居正，海瑞，对外的将领有胡宗宪，俞大猷，戚继光等等，群星璀璨的时代。\n电视剧\n以上说的都是历史背景，这部电视剧由小说改编而来，自然改编了一些历史事实，比如司礼监这边虚构了吕芳，陈洪，黄锦的一些事，胡宗宪与严嵩之间跳过了赵文华，史书记载严嵩是个身材高挑的大帅哥，而严世蕃是个独眼龙，这也与剧中有所不同。\n电视剧中，嘉靖皇帝迷信修仙问道，将朝中权利一分为三，分别委派给司礼监，以严嵩为首的严党，以裕王为首的清流。三派之间互相争斗，互相制衡，形成三足鼎立的模式，而嘉靖就在其中调停，达到控制全局的目的。\n剧中的每一个人个性非常的鲜明。\n人物\n徐阶\n对于徐阶来说是忍。\n严嵩当内阁首辅，徐阶当次辅，这样的关系已经持续了十几二十年。\n有一集司礼监老祖宗吕芳被临时派走了，二祖宗陈洪当差，而内阁严嵩被告知回家养病，由内阁次辅徐阶行使实际权力。这时候千年老二陈洪一副小人嘴脸，本来在司礼监批红的奏章，直接拿到了徐阶当值的内阁中，并主动对徐阶示好：“不管怎么说，我都比阁老晚一辈，往后只要阁老在内阁当值，我都过这来批红。”徐阶言辞拒绝了陈洪，并对他背诵了那篇韩愈的《祭十二郎文》：“近日，徐某重读…",

To get the old behavior, use npm --depth 9999 update.\n官网 v7 的说明\nhttps://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v7/commands/npm-update\nThis command will update all the packages listed to the latest version (specified by the tag config), respecting the semver constraints of both your package and its dependencies (if they also require the same package).\n我理解的结论\n意味着 npm 的版本在执行 npm update 时\n<2.6.1：默认会递归更新\n2.6.1-6：默认不会递归，可以使用 depth 指定深度\n>=7：默认会\n\n关于 npm update 是否会影响 package.json 的说明\n官网 v6 的说明\nhttps://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v6/commands/npm-update#description\nAs of npm@5.0.0, the npm update will change package.json to save the new version as the minimum required dependency.

          "description": "周末看到隔壁有个帖子讨论memos，感觉现在不管是官方电报群还是 github issue ，大家普遍对产品的设计思路上（主要是功能变更）或多或少有点不满。\nmemos 作为一款开源软件，我在其仅 700 个 star 的时候就开始部署使用（当时在寻找 flomo 的开源替代品），现在已然是个 28.5k 的知名项目了，这两年已经写了两千多张卡片了。恰逢去年今天，我在毫无 go 语言和前段开发基础的情况下，借着搜索引擎开始魔改开发自己想要的功能，作为魔改一周年的纪念，周末趁着难得的空闲，录了个B 站视频汇总介绍一下这一年的所有魔改。\n搞笑的是，一年过去了，我到现在也还没系统学过 go 语言和前端，仅有一点非专业的 python 知识，但是已经可以非常轻松地在 Github Copilot 和 GPT4 的帮助下去魔改实现我想要的各种功能了，这算是这一年很大的一个收获了。\n比如我现在完全不知道 Typescript ，Vue ，React 这些的差异，问 GPT 的时候也是统称为“这是一段 Typescript 代码...”，或者“帮我用 Typescript 实现...”\n发视频的原因也是因为好奇心想了解下，这些我为自己度身定制的功能，对其他人来说是不是也是好用的功能，因为我经常脑补如果自己是 memos 的官方开发者：如果我发布这些功能会不会也被人吐槽。。。（排除代码写的很烂的原因）",

PixelOS ，优点是尽可能接近 Pixel 体验，但是开发者名言目前版本还不支持自适应刷新率和杜比视界。\n2. LineageOS ，目前标示为非正式稳定版，似乎没有什么明显的功能缺失。\n3. AOSPA （ Paranoid ），暂时没看到其他用户反馈比较明显的 bug ，其他 ROM 的用户反而提到这个 ROM 电池寿命、AOD 等功能很赞。但之前从未刷过这个 ROM ，还是心里没底。\n4. CherishOS ，也是从未刷过的 ROM ，开发者说没什么 issue ，但下面的用户反馈有不少 bug 。\n恳请在用或通过小米 13 各种类原生 ROM 的 V 友，分享一下你的使用体验和建议，感谢！",

          "description": "之前几年一直用的 pdd ，没出什么意外，前几天只是看不惯 pdd 有些行为，想着不能惯着流氓，就试了下 tb 。\n前二天第一次下单，买了些调料和一个小电器，一搜我要的电器牌子，排前面的有个比别家便宜很多的，就是原价差不多，但有个大的优惠券，总价下来 1/3 左右。我当时就想这价不太可能，但因为几年没收到假货了，所以也没放心上。\n到货后，在快递站，因为想着价格因素可能有猫腻，所以我先开箱验货，果然一开箱发现发的货是同品类外形非常相似但牌子和网站说明的不一样，做工一看也很垃圾，当场拒收，并点了只退款。然后显示等待卖家 24 小时内处理，我就走人了（之前在 pdd 也退过小物件，秒退款，但不知道几百元级的小电器类是什么流程）。\n过了二天想起来看看退款情况，24 小时早过去了，但退款单状态变成了“商家拦截快递 商家将在 2 天 xx 时 xx 分处理“，不知道是商家在尽量延长这个时间还是 tb 的只退款流程就这样。\n去看了下这个商品的评论，果然买家发的开箱图片都和商品描述牌子不一样，想在下面评论让后来人别上当，但发不出去，显示“用户信用双零“，好吧，这个 tb 帐号确实是新注册的，确实没有任何办法报复这个店。看了下这个店，只有三个商品，月销过千，保证金 500 元（这么少吗？感觉可以随时跑路新开）\n总结：网上买东西别贪小便宜，大件最好开箱验下货，否则搬回家再回去退太折腾了。",

          "description": "在 3 个月前，我在 V2EX 上首次分享了 PeerBanHelper这个小工具，用来和 hp/torrent 、dt/torrent 进行技术对抗。\n在这之后越来越多的朋友们加入了 PBH 社区，并贡献了许多关键模块和代码，在此对各位为 PBH 做出贡献的人们说声感谢。\n3 个月的更新迭代，现在新推出了 v4.3 版本，除了简单的过滤器，现在更支持伪装检测等等新功能，变化之大我想值得新开一贴再向各位重新介绍一下。\n新增支持的下载器\n在各位朋友的支持下，我们新扩展了两款下载器的支持，分别是：\nDeluge\nBiglyBT (Vuze/Azureus 家族)\n只需要分别安装为上述两款 BT 下载器安装扩展插件(Deluge|BiglyBT)，就可以连接到 PeerBanHelper 了。\n对于还不支持的下载器，可以先使用收集的 IP 规则库，降低影响。\n多拨检测\n感谢 Github 用户 @CharlesChou73 的出色贡献。PeerBanHelper 新版本现在还支持多拨检测，能够有效检测同一 IP 段下的大量异常用户并封禁它们，例如下图这样的：\n\n连锁封禁\n在新的版本里，当特定网段内有 Peers 触发规则被封禁时，它也会连锁封禁同网段下其它的 Peers ，即使它们没有触发多拨检测。\n新的 AviatorScript 脚本引擎\n新版本中全新添加了 AviatorScript 脚本引擎 以允许 PBH 的用户进行编程，编写自定义的脚本，改变 PBH 的行为。\n并由其拓展了两个基于 AviatorScript 的新功能：\nPeerID / ClientName 伪装检测\nPeerID/ClientName 伪装检测可以检测 PeerID 和 ClientName 不对应的客户端，例如 PeerID 是 -TR2770-，但 ClientName 却标注为 qBittorrent/4.2.5 的客户端。\n吸血雷判断\n根据特征判断迅雷是否是吸血变种，在 PeerID 和 ClientName 过滤器禁用迅雷检查后，AviatorScript 迅雷检测脚本就可以开始工作，通过 吸血雷快查表 判断迅雷是否是吸血变种，并只封禁吸血的变种。\n新的 WebUI\n在 @Gaojianli, @XiaoXice 和 @Kaffu-Chino 三位朋友的加入后，PeerBanHelper 的 WebUI 相比上次发帖的版本也获得了质的飞跃。\n除了现在支持通过 WebUI 添加、编辑、删除下载器外，还新增了封禁日志，规则订阅等多个模块。\n下载器\n封禁名单\n封禁日志\n规则订阅\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWindows 安装程序\n之前有朋友提出过建议，在 Windows 上部署困难，现在 PeerBanHelper 也提供了 Windows 的安装程序。和其它的软件一样，双击运行一路下一步就可以安装上了 ;)\n对于 Linux 包管理器和 MacOS 的安装包目前还在研究 install4j 中。这些系统的小伙伴还是要手动装一下 JRE 或者使用 Docker 镜像。\n社区其它内容\n在上次发帖后，PBH 社区也迎来不少 BT 爱好者小伙伴，我们一起建设了一个仓库存放一些可能有用的东西，比如：\nPeerID 速查表 与 @ie12 一起维护的快查表，可以 Ctrl+F 快速查找 PeerID 和客户端对应关系\n吸血雷参考表\n获取 PeerBanHelper\nhttps://github.com/PBH-BTN/PeerBanHelper\n注：gitcode.com 上面的仓库不是我们传的 :(\n最后聊聊别的\n最初编写这款工具的时候，仅仅用于临时目的，并希望这种行为能够随着时间逐渐消失。然而现实是，随着时间推移，这种刷流量的方法似乎正在传播的越来越广。\n在这种情况泛滥后，看到不少朋友决定停止做种/屏蔽整个中国 IP 地址。破坏者为了满足一己私欲，正在波及和摧毁整个国内的 BT 生态（特别是在 IPV6 普及后，难得有所好转之时）。\n希望 PeerBanHelper 能够帮助到那些仍然愿意把互联网精神继续坚持下去的朋友们。不求回报，帮到就好 ;)\n感谢\n感谢这些朋友们，为 PBH 贡献代码，或者参与公共资源编写（排名不分先后）：\n@ie12\n@Gaojianli\n@PluieM\n@zhongfly\n@CharlesChou73\n@DDSRem\n@Ovler-Young\n@BUnipendix\n@Kaffu-Chino\n@XiaoXice\n@azicen",

          "description": "去年十月买的极摩客 G3 N100 迷你主机，安装 PVE 系统不间断使用，出现问题前一直正常工作，从今年 4 月中开始出现自动关机掉电：\n具体情况为开机后过一段时间后机器掉电关机，刚开始时间间隔能有两三天，后来间隔不断减少到几小时、几分钟，甚至掉电后马上按电源键无任何反应，拔掉电源让他休息几分钟后恢复，找了一个 12V 的电源替换，问题依旧，此时我判断为硬件出现了问题，考虑向官方申请售后。\n刚开始以为是硬盘问题，因为查看硬盘 SMART 信息确实有一些异常数据，且系统日志也一直提示，于是更换硬盘，问题依旧，所以异常数据应该是机器自动掉电导致的，而不是硬盘坏了导致的机器掉电。\n五月初申请了售后，五月中售后回电表示安装 Ubuntu 两周并没有复现问题，我提出安装 PVE 8.2 系统看能否复现 ，售后答应了，并在 3 天后回电表示 PVE 8.2 确实会自动掉电关机，PVE 8.1 两天未关机，刚好我也是在四月升级到的 PVE 8.2 ，且离售后结束时间较近，我便同意了售后以软件问题为由原返机器。不清楚他是否有进行一些机器硬件元件的基础检查。\n六月初收到机器后我便安装 PVE 8.1 开始使用，刚好也是两周没有出现问题，月中又开始了自动掉电关机，我手动开机依然在 3 天后自动掉电关机，此时可以确定和系统无关了，是硬件问题。\n我自己观察出来的一些规律就是，机器断电休息的时间越久，不自动掉电的时间就越长，如来回快递期间机器休息了 3-4 天，之后开机就能坚持半个月，然后随着通电时间越久自动掉电越快。\n现在的话，我考虑二次向官方申请售后，但是为了避免售后那边也没有维修思路，找不到问题所在，然后又不愿意以换代修，所以向 V 友们请教一下，这种情况一般会是什么元器件损坏？",

          "description": "关于找工作，最近行情很差。很多人不甘心，不接受找不到合适工作，经历心态崩溃的过程。有些人不能理解为什么工作突然变得有多么难找。浅浅分析了一下，假设市场处于扩张期，公司 A 新开了业务，增加了 10 个岗位，这 10 个人可能是从别的公司跳槽过来的，也可能是原本就没工作的人。假设有 5 个是跳槽的，5 个是原本没工作的。于是 5 个跳槽的原公司就有缺了 5 各职位，市场上有多出来五个职位空缺，那么在一段时间内。市场上的有效职位其实是 15 个，此时相对而言工作容易找。因为一个失业的人，除了那 10 个新增的机会，还有跳槽空出来的五个机会。而市场处于收缩期的话，公司裁掉 10 个人，原本可能想裸辞或者跳槽的人突然也不敢了。也就是说除了整体职位的变少，连跳槽空来的职位也变少了，同时求职的人还变多了。所以此时有效职位减少的更多。所以这多少有点踩踏的味道。类似银行挤兑和通缩螺旋。\n关于找国外公司，即使英语过关很可能也不容易。因为换位思考，一个外国人很可能没听说过你读的学校或者你工作过的公司。名校和名企除外。所以他很难识别你的水平，哪怕你真的实力达到水平。换位思考，你要招一个外国人，他读的大学你没听说过，你很可能认为是个野鸡大学。他工作过的公司你也没听说过。很难知道是不是个皮包公司或者是个虚构的公司。所以你倾向于不冒这个风险，所以这就是很多人强调 GitHub 的作用，因为这是除了学历和名企之外。最能证明你实力的东西。\n关于才华。通常我们认为一个人有才华，我们指的是什么？我们会认为周杰伦有才华，我们也会认为林丹有才华，高考状元有才华。但是这里面的才华是有所不同的。因为周杰伦有才华是因为他创作出了优秀的作品，而林丹和高考状元是在一种制定好的规则中通过竞技取得名次。发现没有，前者是有作品，真正的产生了产品。而后者一种内卷，竞技排名。优秀的音乐创作者有很多，但是竞技体育的冠军只有一个。所以如果你错过了高考，没有在考试中取得一个好成绩。你想证明你有才华，大概率只有创作出优秀的作品这一条路了。\n找工作背八股文也是一种竞技体育，你背，你的竞争对手也在背。这是一种没完没了的核竞赛，这是当前技术面试的现状。希望所有看到这段文字的面试官都不要再考察八股文了。希望大家通过作品证明自己才华。",

          "description": "因为我在自己的媒体服务器里使用的都是 PT 站上的资源，而媒体服务器通常都要求文件名遵循一定的格式（比如 Jellyfin），所以需要重命名做种的文件。虽然我用的 qBittorrent 可以重命名文件并继续做种，但一个一个重命名实在麻烦，后面就通过 Bash 脚本来干这个事，批量将视频文件软链接到对应的媒体文件夹，这样就可以同时做种和提供媒体服务。\n但由于 Bash 语言的局限，这个脚本的扩展性不太好，现在重新用 Python 写了一个专门批量重命名/链接/移动文件的 CLI 工具：batchlink。Python 自带电池，很多我需要的函数标准库里都有，所以实现起来很简单。\n举一个我自己的例子：\nbatchlink -s \\\n  -S \"/srv/resources/Videos/Animation/死亡笔记/\" \\\n  -d \"/srv/emby/Animation/Death Note: Desu nôto (2006)/Season 01/\" \\\n  '*.mkv' 'Death Note: Desu nôto S01E{num:02}.mkv'\n\n-s 表示创建软链接；-S 指定源文件夹；-d 指定目标文件夹；第一个位置参数是一个 glob 通配符，用来筛选需要链接的文件；第二个位置参数是一个 Python f-string ，是创建链接名的模板。模板里的 {num:02} 会按字母表顺序被替换成从 1 开始的序号，还有一些其他的替换变量可以使用，比如从 0 开始的序号 i。\n希望有需求的 V 友可以尝试一下、提提意见：）",

          "description": "一切开始于两件事：\n(1)\n用 Winhawk 更改开始菜单和任务栏样式。\n在颜色选项那里选了自定义之后，把 Windows 颜色调成暗色同时应用颜色保持浅色。这样就导致开始菜单顶部的搜索框依然保持浅色，在暗色的开始菜单下显得十分违和。\n所以我想到了用 Winhawk 把搜索框的大小调到了最小，直接让它消失，这才解决了视觉上的违和感。\n(2)\n更改注册表让 Win11 右键直接展开全部菜单。\n这种方法我看不懂实现原理，但是 Reddit 的网友说是在注册表里添加一些项，让一级菜单无法展开从而让 explorer 不得不直接展开二级菜单。位置在：\nHKEY_CURRENT_USER\\Software\\Classes\\CLSID\\{86ca1aa0-34aa-4e8b-a509-50c905bae2a2}\\InprocServer32\n后面两项本来没有，都是手动添加的。\n没错，就这两种事，我被国内和国外的网友同时警告过不要做侵入 explorer 的事情。我想知道这两件事是如何实现的？会对系统关键功能造成不可忽视的影响吗？",

          "description": "（先此声明：标题所言「关闭」是指运营商局端关闭，而非用户手机端关闭）\n本人 iPhone 15 Pro Max ，卡 1 移动 8 元保号套餐（每月 30 分钟通话时长，无数据流量），卡 2 电信（通话时长和数据流量都管够），手机设置仅由卡 2 提供蜂窝数据，「允许切换蜂窝数据」功能未启用。\n最近从 10086 下发的短信发现卡 1 每月会产生少量（ 0.几至 3.几 MB ）数据流量（身边朋友和本站都有相同情况 /t/878140 /t/990518 /t/1005849 /t/1032855 ），于是想让移动关闭该卡上网功能。其实这张卡降至保号套餐时就想过关闭上网功能，但当时移动客服说关闭上网功能会导致高清语音通话不可用，所以我权衡一下就没关。但最近在网上看到江苏移动可关闭上网功能并办理「独立高清语音」业务，让我内心一喜。\n\n更多参考链接：\nhttps://www.v2ex.com/t/1032855#r_14598179\nhttps://tieba.baidu.com/p/8962476840\nhttps://www.xiaohongshu.com/explore/6644163a000000001e032201\nhttps://www.txrjy.com/thread-1335643-1-1.html\n\n然而，我联系 10086 后，广东移动客服表示取消上网功能就无法使用高清语音通话，也没有所谓的「独立高清语音」业务可办理，如果想关闭上网功能并保留高清语音通话，可以选择「暂停」上网功能，这个「暂停上网功能」不会与高清语音通话互斥。但是，槽点来了：会在下个月结日自动恢复上网功能，届时需要用户再次办理暂停方可再次关闭上网功能…… 您就说移动这操作恶不恶心人？\n行，咱无可奈何选择暂停上网功能，此时手机依然能连接到 4G/5G 网络，也能使用 VoLTE 或 VoNR ，然后我试着将「 iPhone - 设置 - 蜂窝网络 - 蜂窝数据」关闭，此时 iPhone 状态栏信号格旁的 4G/5G 文字消失。\n\n\n\n然后我用移动卡和电信卡分别拨打 10086 、10000 ，同时通过 *3001#12345#* 查看 Cellular Service Status ，发现此时通话模式均为 VoNR （我之前一直以为必须要开启手机的蜂窝数据功能才能使用 VoLTE/VoNR ，原来不是，这点我在安卓手机上也试验了同样如此）\n\n\n好，最后回到标题：广东移动是否支持关闭数据流量功能并保留高清语音通话(VoLTE/VoNR)？\n是，也不是。\n（ PS.至于暂停上网功能能否不在下个月结日自动恢复，而是由用户有需求时再办理恢复上网功能。有用户此前向广东移动投诉过，广东移动至今不予解决。https://www.txrjy.com/forum.php?mod=redirect&goto=findpost&ptid=1335637&pid=13911798 ）",

          "description": "一、股票行情报价 api 接口\n量化投资者，获取即时的实时行股票行情报价数据是金融从业者和投资者必不可少的需求之一。随着技术的发展，美股数据、A 股数据、港股数据的实时行情数据 API 、行情数据接口成为了实现这一目标的主要方式之一。美股实时行情 API 是指一种应用程序接口，通过它可以获取美股市场上的实时股票价格、交易量等数据。通过使用美股实时行情数据 API ，用户可以实时监测股市动态、进行实时交易决策，从而更好地把握市场机会。\n但是，要想充分利用美股实时行情报价 API 、行情数据接口，首先需要对美股实时股票行情数据有着清晰的理解。美股实时股票行情数据涵盖了股票的实时价格、成交量、市值等信息，是投资者进行交易决策的重要依据之一。因此，美股实时行情数据对接成为了金融科技领域的热门话题之一。通过实现美股行情数据、K 线数据对接，用户可以将实时行情数据与自己的交易系统或者分析工具相连接，实现更加精准的交易决策和风险管理。\n二、以 MT5 接入实时股票行情数据为例，讲述接入步骤：\n2.1 、选择好你要接入的股票行情源：AllTick api\n [官网] : https://alltick.co/\n [ Github ] ： https://github.com/alltick/realtime-forex-crypto-stock-tick-finance-websocket-api\n [接入流程] ： https://github.com/alltick/realtime-forex-crypto-stock-tick-finance-websocket-api/blob/main/access_guide_cn.md\n2.2 、接入实现原理\nMT5 官方提供了整套的 Gateway 接口，通过继承特定的类，实现一些就可以把股票行情数据报送到 MT5 Trade Server,这就上涉及到以下几个大步骤：\n先拿到行情源的实时行情报价数据，实时的，源源不断的得到\n再实现继承 MT5 Gateway API 的程序\n然后通过具体的推送方法把数据推送到 MT5 Trade Server 。\n2.3 、MT5 Gateway API 介绍\nMT5 Gateway API 是用于将 MT5 平台与其他交易系统或者行情数据源集成的一整套工具接口。使用 Gateway API ，您可以实现自定义交易网关和数据源。Gateway API 是一整套 API 功能,包括所使用的数据结构的描述、网关的标识符和虚拟接口， 它的开发语言是 C++，开发工具常以 visual studio 为主，它提供的 32 位和 64 位 DLL 库的源代码示例。涉及与交易平台互动的所有技术细节都隐藏在 DLL 库中，这可以使用简单的方法来控制集成。因此，开发人员的代码不取决于内部变化，并且代码始终都可运行。\n2.4 、具体的接入步骤\n2.4.1 、接入股票行情数据源-AllTick\n接入 AllTick 的实时股票行情源请参考上面 2.1 章节的链接，按照接入流程一步一步就接好了，接好之后数据备用。\n2.4.2 、初始化 CMTGatewayAPIFactory\n声明一个全局的 CMTGatewayAPIFactory 实例即可，并调用 Initialize 一次就好了，它的作用是于创建 GatewayAPI 实例。\n2.4.3 、初始化 GatewayEventSink\n该类继承了 IMTGatewaySink ，用于处理 MT5 Trade Server 的连接情况。\n\n2.4.4 、创建 IMTGatewayAPI\n通过调用 CMTGatewayAPIFactory 的具体实例的 Create 方法创建 GatewayAPI 实例，要注意传参数\n2.4.5 、向 IMTGatewayAPI 发送报价数据\n当从股票行情数据源接收到实时成交报价时，例如从 AllTick 收到它推送的实时成交报价，则调用 GatewayAPI 的 SendTicks 方法向 MT5 Trade Server 发送成交报价\n当从股票行情数据源接收到实时盘口报价时，例如从 AllTick 收到它推送的实时盘口报价，则调用 GatewayAPI 的 SendBooks 方法向 MT5 Trade Server 发送盘口报价\n2.5 、部署\n部署的方式有两种：\n部署到 MT5 Trade Server 本地，然后在 MT5 Admin 平台上进行新增加数据源。\n外部独立部署，然后在 MT5 Admin 平台上进行新增加数据源。\n无论采用哪种方式结果是一样的，关于部署的细节，后续会再单独写篇文章来说明。",

          "description": "在我看来好像是个常识，不能经常充电，我一般在手机电量到 20 以下才会充电。但是突然想到，似乎又不那么应该，毕竟这个理论我听了很多年了，科技的发展即便影响也不应该到明显的地步。我问了 GPT 给我了一个很惊讶的回复，似乎频繁充电才是正确的。那么，有没有专业人士，它说的是正确的吗？\n手机电池的寿命确实会受到充电习惯的影响，但现代智能手机通常使用锂离子电池，这种电池比早期的镍镉（ NiCd ）和镍氢（ NiMH ）电池要更加耐用和高效。\n1. 以下几点可以帮助理解如何充电习惯影响电池寿命：\n\n2. 充电循环：锂离子电池的寿命以充电循环次数来衡量。一个充电循环指的是从 0%到 100%的充电过程或多个部分充电过程的总和达到 100%。随着充电循环次数的增加，电池容量会逐渐下降。\n\n3. 过度充电和过度放电：现代手机通常有防止过度充电和过度放电的保护机制，但保持电池在 20%-80%的区间内充电，可以延长电池寿命。长时间保持满电状态或完全放电都可能对电池产生负面影响。\n\n4. 高温和低温：极端温度对锂离子电池有害。避免在高温环境下充电或使用手机，也避免让手机在寒冷环境中长时间运行。\n\n5. 快充技术：虽然快充非常方便，但频繁使用快充功能可能会产生更多热量，从而加速电池老化。如果不急需快速充电，使用常规充电速度可能更好。\n\n总的来说，经常充电并不会显著缩短锂离子电池的寿命，但一些优化的充电习惯可以帮助延长电池的整体寿命。```",

(300 + 30), 这样以后 4 个人可以共同消费.\n2. 由于一些原因, 某一天 D 有事情, 不能参加中午的聚餐, 所以只有 A, B, C 三个人参加了聚餐, 总共消费 54 元. 此时卡里为 276 元.\n3. 由于 D 并没有参加这次 54 元的消费, 所以 D 如果继续参加接下来的 4 人聚餐, 会有点 “吃亏”.\n4. 请问 A, B, C 应该各付给 D 多少钱, 从而抹平这次消费, 且保证之后的 4 人聚餐公平, 即 4 个人所持有的会员卡余额份额保持一致?",

L 系列能进入美国的话, 绝对能把那些歪瓜裂枣打得落花流水, 我对这话负责)\n李想同学对于车型和配置还是很有深刻了解的, 脚踏实地造人民想要的车也是个正确的方向, 也许能在这激烈的竞争环境中脱颖而出.\n现在已经全力买 LI 了.\n企业做大后也许还是要有远大的理想, 开发前沿科技改变出行方式能让理想走得更远?\nBYD:\n炙手可热.\n国内外很多人不了解造车新势力, 但对 BYD 却不陌生. 在控制成本和研发方面确实也做得很好, 也许能取代丰田独领全球汽车市场?\n个人对 BYD 车的设计和配置实在提不起兴趣, 人还是要有的审美的吧. \n小米:\nSU7 也许是一辆好车, 市场好像也不错.\n小米能整合供应链, 也能开发出自己的东西, 后续车型应该也不错.\n小米已经是巨型企业了, 实在没必要做这种赤裸裸的抄袭. 还真没想到普罗大众对抄袭的容忍度这么高. \n问界以及各种界:\n有些车型在用料方面还是舍得下本的, 华为光环对车还是有实际提升的.\nAgain, 个别车型的外观抄袭还是很无耻的.\n造车厂商和华为还是存在利益分歧的, 苹果在已经栽了, 很怀疑各种界能否走得长远.\n其他各品牌:\n这个我也没啥有意义的看法, 传统厂商滞后了这么多年, 不知道其现在能否取得优势. 也许能在成本和质量方面取得优势, 这恰恰也是最重要的, 这成就了丰田, 也许能成就某些传统厂商.\n好啦, 这里就瞎扯啦一些自己的看法, 也提到了股票. 主要是想了解车, 买股票只是想验证自己的看法.\n车圈水军脑残粉太多了, 希望这里能看到更多真实的想法)))",

          "description": "上一个帖子是因为看到了《脱了裤子放屁》那篇帖子写的，但不仅仅是因为这篇，印象中之前也看到过类似的，记不清了，也可能是无中生记了。\n我也说说我的看法，不一定对，欢迎拍砖指正，只要说得对，骂一骂也没关系。（我这篇也是来秀无知的)\n++++++++++++++++++++++++++\n首先明确的是，重放攻击的重点在于：如果有第三方拿到一个网络请求，在不解包的情况下，重复发送该请求，会造成服务出现\"安全问题\"。\n\n第一，攻击者不需要解包，因为它的假设是，攻击者(不需要/不能)从请求中抓取有用信息，也(不需要/不能)篡改请求。\n\n第二，跟幂等的关系。幂等的意思是 n 次操作的结果等同于一次操作，是允许多次操作的，而防重放供给是不允许重复请求的，这会造成\"安全隐患\"。不过对于某些场景某些实现的\"幂等\"是可以起到防重的作用的。比如某些幂等的实现是只有第一次请求是真的在操作，后续重复请求实际上是\"没有操作\"的。\n举个不恰当的例子：假如你有一个登录接口在登录成功后返回用户信息，内部实现也支持了幂等，即：同一个用户多次登录和一次登录的效果是等效的,session 只有一个，但是却没有考虑重放攻击的问题。再假设攻击者拦截到该登录请求，是不是攻击者在不修改请求的情况下，也可以登录系统？\n\n第三，限流是限流，重放攻击是重放攻击。限流强调频次，重放攻击的重点不在于频次，它可能只需要一次就可以攻击成功。我们需要明确自己需要的是限流还是防重放攻击还是都需要？\n\n第四，请求需要被加密保护或者有私钥签名是基本条件，因为如果请求不加密，也没有私钥签名/加密，一定能被攻击者构造。但是跟 https 协议本身有没有防重放攻击的支持没有关系，这两个不在同一层面。\napi 请求可以是像 web 端被 https 加密保护，也可以是给第三方使用被一个\"私钥\"保护。\n第五， 我认为这是容易造成混乱边界范围不清晰的一个点。即：\"重复一个请求\"指的是重复用户\"发出的请求\"，还是说，攻击者也可以根据客户端泄露的代码等信息\"构造出一条参数一摸一样的请求\"。我认为是前者，\n因为攻击者如果是通过查阅客户端代码构造出请求，它可以构造出任何请求。这种情况应该不在\"重放攻击\"范围内，重放攻击本身也是属于中间人攻击。\n\n第六，原帖提到\"token 的生成规则\"，说\"攻击者也可以完全模拟这个 token 的生成规则，来绕过服务端\"。攻击者当然可以拿到生成规则，包括生成签名的公钥。\n\t1. 作者的方案，是客户端生成 token ，假定了攻击者能够拿到客户端的规则、可能还包括了生成签名的公钥。所以攻击者可以构造一个攻击请求。但是这不是\"重放攻击\"的讨论范围，这不是\"拦截到请求进行重放\"，而是构造了一个新的请求，该请求的参数可以由攻击者任意指定。\n\t\t2. 对于客户端生成 token ，因为含有：随机数、时间戳，所以服务端可以在一次处理完成之后记忆下来，在近 n 分钟内不再处理含有相同随机数、时间戳的请求。中间人自然无法重放攻击。中间人即便拦截到请求，也无法篡改其随机数、时间戳，可能是因为整个请求是加密的、也可能是因为请求含有私钥签名。\n\n最后，原作者说：\"sync ，lock ，多线程等，工作中根本用不到\"，作者给出的代码，很明显有一个地方因为没有用锁或者 redis 的原子操作，会导致这个代码防重失效。\n且看原作者代码：\n```\n\t\tString s = redisService.opsForValue().get(timestamp);\n\t\tif (StringUtils.isNotEmpty(s)) {\n\t\t\treturn false;\n\t\t} else {\n\t\t\tredisService.opsForValue().set(timestamp, timestamp, NONCE_DURATION, TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS);\n\t\t}\n```",

          "description": "在网上浏览的时候看到了下面的一种写法，可以通过新建一个 Promise 对象，在 Promise 对象中绑定回调函数，并获取回调结果，类似与下面这种：\n\n    const img = document.getElementById(\"bg\");\n    \n    const message = () => {\n      return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {\n        img.onload = () => {\n          resolve(\"Image loaded successfully\"); // 返回回调函数的结果\n        };\n      });\n    };\n\n    const AsyncTest = async () => {\n      try {\n        const msg = await message();\n        console.log(msg);\n      } catch (error) {\n        console.log(error);\n      }\n    };\n\n\n上面的代码确实能够将回调函数的返回值作为 Promise 的调用结果返回。\n随后突发奇想，用下面这种方式分别异步调用两次上面代码中的 AsyncTest 的函数：\n\n    // 连续两次调用 AsyncTest 函数\n    AsyncTest().then(() => {\n      console.log(\"Async function executed\");\n    });\n    AsyncTest().then(() => {\n      console.log(\"Async function executed\");\n    });\n    \n\n结果发现虽然两次调用，但是只有一个调用有返回，个人的理解是：\n第一次调用 Promise ，给 onload 绑定回调函数，其中传入的 resolve 是第一个 Promise 的\n此时图片还没有加载完成\n第二次调用 Promise ，覆盖掉了 onload 的回调函数，其中的 resolve 变成了第二个 Promise 的\n图片加载完成，调用 onload 函数，其中调用的是第二个 Promise 的 resolve\n这样是否就意味着，第一次的 Promise 始终没有完成，保存在栈空间中，并在 EventLoop 中循环等待 resolve 的调用。 在图片加载完成后拍了堆快照，发现堆中确实留下了一个 Promise 的空间：\n\n请教一下，这是否意味着这块内存空间是否会始终被占用，以及利用 Promise 监听 onload 回调这种写法是否妥当？",

          "description": "2023 年 5 月 21 号开始跑步，到今天 2024 年 6 月 9 号，跑步一年多了，总共跑了整整 170 次。我深知对于我这样体力，精力都接近普通人来说，每一次的跑步对于我来说真的太珍贵了，所以每一次跑步我都记录下来，不是炫耀，更不是攀比，就是单纯的记录。\n一直想写篇总结，今天，它来了！给即将跑步的你或者热爱跑步的你一些心得或者是启示。\n跑步会瘦吗？\n先回答大家最关心的问题，跑步会瘦吗？对于我个人来说，并没有。如果你想瘦一些，饮食非常的重要，有句话叫做三分练，七分吃。如果你每天的消耗量大于摄入量，那么你肯定会瘦。\n反观我自己，每次跑完步，胃口反而更好了，啤酒，汉堡，可乐，以前觉得有些腻，现在一样都没有落下。和同事们一起吃饭，胃口往往是最大的那个。不过，还是归功于运动，尽管在吃的方面毫无顾忌，因为有运动，所以体重很稳定，一直在 140 左右，有时候早上空腹称一下，会掉到 136 左右。\n跑步会改变人生吗？\n之前看过很多炸裂的答案，说每天坚持跑步，或者是坚持跑步一年，你的人生会发生翻天覆地的变化，从此走上成功人生！\n是这样吗？对我而言，生活还是在继续，该碰到问题，还是会碰到问题，该有哪些困难，还是有哪些困难。\n不过，精神状态明显感觉有变化，我本身体质偏虚，自从跑步之后，中气变足了很多，人也比以前更沉稳，更自信一些了。\n还有一点比较欣喜的是，多了一种掌控感。生活在上海这个城市，时时刻刻感觉到自己的渺小。通过跑步，让我对于掌控自己稍微有了一些的自信心。而且这种掌控感会带到别的方面：如果我连这么枯燥，这么乏味的跑步都能坚持下去，那么放下手机去学习一小时或者去尝试一下自己的知识盲区，是不是也能更轻松的应对一些？因为有这种心态，所以做其他的事时也会增强信心。\n为什么选择跑步\n从去年看了菲尔奈特的《鞋狗》后，就在心里埋下了一颗种子。\n作为一个程序员，久坐的时间比较长，日常的身体状态…",

          "description": "地址：GitHub\n这几天 DockerHub 的镜像仓库被下线对我影响不小，我很多内网机器并没有配置什么特殊的网络服务，配置起来也比较复杂，干脆准备自己搭建一个专门为自己服务的 Docker 镜像源。\n感谢 GitHub Actions 和阿里云镜像托管服务，可以省去自己搭建专门的服务器，也希望大家点个 star 。\n使用阿里云出品的 image-syncer 而非直接通过 Docker pull & push 可以规避 Docker 客户端不方便自定义复杂的拉取规则。\n简单使用方式\n1. 配置阿里云容器镜像服务\n登录容器镜像服务，新建个人版容器命名空间。\n「访问凭证」- 设置固定密码。\n记住「访问凭证」中的仓库地址、非脱敏后的用户名和密码，下一步需要用到。\n2. Fork 本项目\n进入 Fork 后自己的项目。\n修改 auth.yaml 中的字段为 自己仓库地址/命名空间。\n「 Settings 」-「 Secret and variables 」-「 Actions 」-「 New repository secret 」新增 ACR_USER 和 ACR_PASSWORD，分别为「阿里云容器镜像服务」-「访问凭证」中非脱敏后的用户名和密码。\n进入「 Actions 」启用 Actions 。\n编辑 images.yaml 添加对应镜像即可，规则参考 image-syncer，建议用 latest 等 TAG 限制转存范围，防止过分滥用 Actions 服务。\n（可选）把自己仓库地址配置成镜像源，省去输入完整镜像地址。\n修改原来的镜像地址为 images.yaml 配置的目标地址。",

          "description": "看到很多人说 spring security 复杂。个人认为复杂以下几个方面。（说句废话：研究过其实也就不复杂了）\n第一，spring security 的 filter 和如何配置 filter 这两部分的设计是分离的，恰恰是如何配置 filter 这部分做了高度抽象（涉及 HttpSecurity 、WebSecurity 、SecurityConfigurer 、SecurityBuilder 相关接口），导致不熟悉的用户很难将 filter 内部和配置串联起来。我认为这些高度抽象的配置相关设计让用户感到复杂的罪魁祸首。\n\n第二，通常最符合我们直觉的是：一个请求会经过哪些 filter ，以 url 的角度来描述 filter 序。但事实上配置起来可不是这么回事，配置时我们通常是：这个 filter 需要匹配哪些 url ，站在了 filter 的角度去匹配 url 。当有人接手我们的代码，或者我们自己，在稍微复杂一点的个性化需求下，也需做一个心理模型的转换，转换到一个请求应该先后经过哪些 filter 才能达到我们的预期。\n第三，spring security 的 filter 某些设计是有些复杂，比如用户密码登录 filter 又涉及到 authenticationManager ，用户信息查询、密码处理以及登录成功失败如何按需处理等等，鉴权部分又涉及到表达式，但其实 debug 串一串还好。\n第四，filter 是有序的，比如登录 filter 前后有一些重要的 filter ，可能和 session/cookie 相关，可能和 SecurityContext 相关，可能和异常相关，这一部分我觉得遵循\"filter 有序\"debug 串一串，读一读源码其实行也还好。如果想要知道 servlet 的 filter 是怎么搞的，spring 的 filter 又是如何桥接到 servlet 中的 filter 的，filter 又是怎么到 controller 的，怎么样可以 filter 直接 response 而不用到 controller ，怎么样可以让一个请求不走 filter 直达 controller 可能还需要再花点功夫。\n\n暂时想到这些。综合起来我觉得导致用户感到复杂的就是\"高度抽象的配置接口\"，其他看看官方文档，滴一滴 bug ，看看源码接口设计其实都不是啥问题。",

          "description": "6月27日，暴雪魔兽世界国服停服520天后回归，《魔兽世界》中国官方微博宣布，魔兽世界怀旧服“巫妖王之怒”所有服务器现已开放。此外，魔兽世界正式服也将在8月1日重启，并于8月27日全球同步开启魔兽世界正式服地心之战的资料片。\n\r\n\r\n官方本月早些时候表示，6月27日至7月10日软启动期间，游戏时间将不会消耗，战网商城服务也将无法使用，服务器也将暂时处于锁定状态。7月10日将进行24小时的停服维护，维护完成后，怀旧服“巫妖王之怒”的所有服务就将完全重启，服务器限制也会解除。\n\r\n\r\n我虽然是主要玩《魔兽世界》正式服，但由于正式服还有一个月才上线，因此我就先体验一下这个先上线的怀旧服，玩了几天，感触颇深，下面是我的一点点体验。\n\r\n\r\n服务器硬件和网络体验\n\r\n\r\n我从广东连接魔兽世界怀旧服，显示怀旧服的延迟为23-27ms左右。\n\r\n\r\n我记得最后一次玩国服正式服的时候，延迟只有2、3ms，玩台服的时候，用了加速器，延迟也就20多ms，现在国服怀旧服重开，延迟和台服差不多，新的国服起码在网络延迟上，还是有一些优化空间的。\n\r\n\r\n希望国服正式服上线的时候，延迟能恢复到原来的2、3ms左右。\n\r\n\r\n升级过程体验差\n\r\n\r\n再说一下怀旧服的游戏体验吧，我从1级号开始练级，在有50%经验加成的基础上，从1级升级到80级需要130小时左右的时间。这期间，感觉到了游戏设计师满满的恶意，相比正式服，怀旧服的升级设计简直就是折腾人。\n\r\n\r\n明明可以有个飞行点，就是没有飞行点，从闪金镇到暴风城还要小跑过去，纯粹就是为了浪费玩家的时间。20级才能骑马，60级才能飞行，想想学习飞行需要的金币就头疼。\n\r\n\r\n金币抠抠搜搜就是不给你，学个骑术的3个金币都攒不到，学个专业技能都能把金币花光，对比正式服一个10秒钟简单任务就能赚500金币，对比太强烈了。\n\r\n\r\n怪物等级设计不合理，同等级小怪打起来都难的很，副本更是地狱难度，死亡次数太多了。更绝的是，在副本死后，需要在副本外跑尸，很多副本入口隐藏极深，很难找到入口。为了更多地浪费玩家的时间，设计师专门把副本的任务放在副本外面接，也在副本外面交。\n\r\n\r\n我练的牧师职业异常缺蓝，基本打一个小怪就能把蓝耗光，打一个怪就得坐下喝水回蓝，打一个怪，喝半分钟水，如果不小心add到第二个怪，通常就必死无疑，然后要走很长的路来跑尸，体验非常不好。\n\r\n\r\n在技能方面，怀旧服的很多职业重要技能给的太晚了，导致玩家在早期练级过程极其痛苦，很多技能无法使用，前三十级练级体验很差，之后的体验才慢慢变好。\n\r\n\r\n满级后体验变好\n\r\n\r\n80级满级以后，游戏体验是整个过程中最好的，从PVP和PVE两方面都体验不错。\n\r\n\r\n在PVP方面，国服战场PVP人数很多，2分钟就能排一个40人史诗战场，这在亚服是不可想象的，我在亚服一年多来，从来没有成功排进过1个40人史诗战场，哪怕就是十几个人的小战场，亚服也要15分钟以上才能排进去，而国服这种2分钟就能排一个战场的体验，完全碾压亚服的PVP战场体验。不足之处是PVP战场太少，只有五个PVP战场。\n\r\n\r\n在PVP平衡性方面，某些职业过于强势，职业的平衡性不如正式服，不少职业怀旧服和正式服的玩法大相径庭，例如戒律牧师在怀旧服和正式服几乎是两种完全不同的玩法。\n\r\n\r\n除了PVP，PVE在满级后体验也不错，虽然功能较少，但随机英雄副本基本上5分钟内都能进去，还算是不错的体验。\n\r\n\r\n在装备获取上，通过PVP的荣誉点数和PVE的英雄点数，都可以在短时间内换到不错的装备，让玩家在装备获取上较为轻松。\n\r\n\r\n不过，怀旧服的副本装备拾取机制非常不合理，导致玩家之间容易产生矛盾，绝大多数踢人都是因为装备拾取问题，这点正式服的装备拾取机制完全碾压怀旧服。\n\r\n\r\n结论\n\r\n\r\n怀旧服用户的主要设计特点，是为了更多消耗用户时间来弥补内容相对不足，因此设计出很多恶心人的套路来折腾用户，复杂的世界地图，极少的飞行点，让未满级的玩家痛苦不已，只有满级之后，体验才会慢慢好起来。\n\r\n\r\n正式服用户的主要设计特点是赛季模式，半年一个赛季，装备就会更替，装备和金币获取更容易，设计的主要方向也不再是消耗用户时间了，设计师把主要精力花在怎么让用户更爽，更容易续费的正确道路上。\n\r\n\r\n总之，怀旧服的装备获取难度，金币获取难度，都远远高于正式服，未接触过魔兽世界的新手玩家更应该选择正式服而不是怀旧服。",

          "description": "据媒体报道，6月24日下午，苏州日本人学校的校车遭到了一名外来男子的袭击。这一次持刀伤人案件当中，一对日本的母子受伤。还有一个过去阻拦凶手的中国女子，也被砍成了重伤。\n\r\n\r\n对于这件事情，胡锡进发文发表了他的看法。首先胡锡进先是谴责了那个持刀伤人的凶手，说他这样的行为不仅违反法律，还破坏了中日友好的关系。所以不管怎么说，他都支持对凶手进行严惩，让凶手遭受法律的制裁。同时那个阻拦凶手行凶的中国女子应该是见义勇为，值得我们嘉奖。而且她的做法，也反映了绝大多数中国人的善良。在所有中国人当中，大多数人都是善良的，都是会见义勇为的。\n\r\n\r\n以下为胡锡进微博全文：\n\r\n\r\n\r\n老胡谴责苏州持刀伤人者，并有三点基本判断\n\r\n\r\n第一， 老胡谴责苏州发生的男子砍伤三人事件，无论嫌犯是出于什么目的，是不是故意要针对日本人犯罪，我都要谴责他。如果此人行凶针对的就是日本人，我要说，他的这种动机在中国社会中一定是遭唾弃的。互联网上有一些“反日情绪”，但这绝不代表我们的社会支持对在华日本人采取极端行动。绝大多数中国人不仅坚决支持捍卫法治，而且希望中日两国和平友好，加强各种交流与合作，对日本人在华工作、旅游、生活普遍持欢迎态度。而且我深信，这一态度的主流性不可撼动。\n\r\n\r\n第二， 老胡同意中国官方部门的判断，苏州发生的砍伤一对日本母子和一名校车上中国人的事件，它在中国社会总体上就是偶发的，吉林此前发生的一嫌犯刺伤多名美国人事件也是一样。即使这次行凶者是专门针对日本人，其作案动机的形成在中国庞大社会里也是极其零星的。在大秩序和对外国人普遍友好的态度中，这样的个例绝不具有某种代表性，它就是孤立的，是大环境中的偶然。所以在谴责这起作案的同时，不应当夸大它的意义。就像在其他国家和社会里，也都有受害者是外国人的案件发生，其中有个别是专门以外国人为目标一样。不能因为苏州出了这起事件，就做无边无际的延伸解读。\n\r\n\r\n这起事件中，校车上那名中国女子因阻止行凶，受了最重的伤，仍在抢救中。老胡认为，那名女子现场迸发的英勇阻止反映了绝大多数中国人的善良，以及我们对任何行凶的集体态度。\n\r\n\r\n最后老胡想对网友们说，我们大家要了解，目前中国与日本的关系相对紧张复杂，这个时候发生砍伤日本人的事件，比如果中日彼此关系好的时候，会产生更加敏感的效应。因此这个时候不仅法律会严惩凶犯，咱们大家也要在网上亮明我们社会对这一行凶的唾弃，那将有助于扩大国际上对我们社会里主流对外友好态度的了解，更加相信所发生的案件就是偶然的。\n\r\n\r\n\r\n警方通报“日本公民在苏州遇袭”:犯罪嫌疑人已被刑拘\n\r\n\r\n\r\n苏州市公安局苏州高新区分局发布警情通报：\n\r\n\r\n6月24日16时许，苏州高新区塔园路新地中心公交站台发生一起持刀伤人案件，造成3人受伤（其中1人为中国籍，2人为日本籍）。公安局巡逻警力第一时间到场处置，当场抓获犯罪嫌疑人周某某（男，52岁，为近期从外地来苏州无业人员），并立即将伤者送医救治。\n\r\n\r\n目前，中国籍伤者因在阻止嫌疑人犯罪过程中受伤严重，仍在抢救中；1名日本籍伤者正在治疗，无生命危险，另1名日本籍伤者当日已出院。周某某已被刑事拘留。案件侦办工作正在进一步开展中，将依法依规对犯罪行为予以严惩。",

          "description": "之前有博主在一家平价超市测试100元人民币到底能购买多少生活必需品，该视频引发网友热议，我也写过一篇“100元人民币的购买力”的文章，测试了100元人民币可以在深圳沃尔玛超市购买多少肉蛋奶产品，本篇文章将进一步测试，20美元可以在美国沃尔玛超市购买多少肉蛋奶产品。\n\r\n\r\n沃尔玛是美国最大的连锁超市之一，人们几乎能在这里买到生活所需的任何东西，包括食品、电子设备、家居用品、服装等。同时，沃尔玛售卖的商品都物美价廉且离市区较近，通常也是人们购买生活必需品的第一选择。\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n沃尔玛具有网上超市功能，在网上即可下单，我测试的是洛杉矶沃尔玛的商品价格，不同地区的价格可能不一样。我选择的是以肉蛋奶相关关键词搜索排名前列的商品价格，全都是畅销商品（Best seller），经过测试，20美元可以购买到2.27公斤大米，3.78升牛奶，18个鸡蛋，0.907公斤冷冻蔬菜，0.45公斤碎牛肉。\n\r\n\r\n下面是购买到的详细商品列表和价格。\n\r\n\r\n惠宜长粒强化大米，5磅（2.27公斤），3.52美元。\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n惠宜全脂牛奶，1加仑（3.78升），3.76美元。\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n惠宜无笼鸡蛋，18个，3.82美元。\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n惠宜冷冻蔬菜，32盎司（907克），2.76美元。\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n全天然（80%瘦肉/20%肥肉）碎牛肉，1磅（454克），5.37美元。\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n5件商品合计价格是19.23美元，折合140元人民币。\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n总的来说，从食物营养的角度来看，20美元在洛杉矶沃尔玛的购买力相当不错，一个人吃一周应该没问题，足以满足一个人的基本食品需求。",

The chars argument is a string specifying the set of characters to be removed. If omitted or None, the chars argument defaults to removing whitespace. The chars argument is not a suffix; rather, all combinations of its values are stripped.\nFrom Built-in Types — Python 3.12.4 documentation\n文档中已经明确并举例说明了这一行为及其含义。然而，对于新开发者来说，这是出乎意料的行为。毕竟，这些函数看起来都很直观。\n我的示例执行以下操作：",
