          "description": "TL;DR: https://pyflo.net is a free, interactive guide to learning Python\nHi Everyone, I am a CS educator who has taught a variety of university courses, including many on introductory Python programming. Over the past few years, I've written down a number of Python programming lessons and has culminated into Pyflo.net. This tool is a completely free, introductory guide to learning Python. It is more-or-less an intro programming textbook, but with a few twists, including:\n* It is totally free. You don't even have to give me your email to use it\n* The lessons are short and modularized\n* It's interactive, containing embedded questions that provide instant feedback throughout.\nMy hope is that this can be a useful resource for those looking to learn Python. Feel free to use yourself, or share with those you think would be interested.\nFeedback is very much welcome and appreciated.\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36936797\nPoints: 9\n# Comments: 0",

We created Khoj as a hobby project 2+ years ago because: (1) Search on the desktop sucked; we just had keyword search on the desktop vs google for the internet; and (2) Natural language search models had become good and easy to run on consumer hardware by this point.\nOnce we made Khoj search incremental, I completely stopped using the default incremental search (C-s) in Emacs. Since then Khoj has grown to support more content types, deeper integrations and chat (using ChatGPT). With Llama 2 released last week, chat models are finally good and easy enough to use on consumer hardware for the chat with docs scenario.\nKhoj is a desktop application to search and chat with your personal notes, documents and images.

Previous threads we've done:  https://news.ycombinator.com/submitted?id=proberts.\nI'll be here for the next 2-3 hours and then after a break of about 1 hour for another 2-3 hours. As usual, there are many possible topics and I'll be guided by whatever you're concerned with. Please remember that I can't provide legal advice on specific cases for obvious liability reasons because I won't have access to all the facts.

          "description": "Hi HN, we’re Mayank and Matt of Roundtable (https://roundtable.ai/). We use LLMs to produce cheap, yet surprisingly useful, simulations of surveys. Specifically, we train LLMs on standard, curated survey datasets. This approach allows us to essentially build general-purpose models of human behavior and opinion. We combine this with a nice UI that lets users easily visualize and interpret the results.\nSurveys are incredibly important for user and market research, but are expensive and take months to design, run, and analyze. By simulating responses, our users can get results in seconds and make decisions faster. See https://roundtable.ai/showcase for a bunch of examples, and https://www.loom.com/share/eb6fb27acebe48839dd561cf1546f131 for a demo video.\nOur product lets you add questions (e.g…",

          "description": "I've been watching Elon Musk's takeover of Twitter, and I've even been personally affected by it (negatively), so I wanted a way to vent using open-source software and some very basic art skills. I woke up yesterday with an idea in mind for a MAD Fold-In[1].\nA MAD Fold-In is a piece of artwork on the inside-back cover of each issue of \"MAD Magazine\". The main image can be folded to reveal a hidden, secondary image.\nI wanted to share my interactive picture with others, but printing a fold-in and mailing it to friends with instructions seemed really hard, so I searched for a digital way to do it.\nI found a blog post[2] from Thomas Park where he already did 100% of the work necessary to make a MAD Fold-In using nothing but CSS and HTML and a normal PNG image.\nUsing Inkscape and some Creative Commons images, I drafted a rough piece of artwork and tweaked it until the CSS folded it nicely.\nI wouldn't normally share here, but I think other HN readers may get some utility from seeing and trying out a purely CSS implementation of a MAD Fold-In, even if I didn't write the CSS myself. I'm hoping to start a trend where others make their own fold-ins.\nMoreover, Elon Musk picked today of all days to rebrand the Twitter logo as a unicode \"X\" character (𝕏). So, the Twitter bird really _did_ die today, as happened in my MAD fold-in, making my post somewhat topical and weirdly apropos.\nIf this post is too off-topic, please feel free to take it down. If it stays up, please let me know what you think. In the event my server goes down, I made a WayBack Machine archive of the site [3].\n[1] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mad_Fold-in\n[2] https://thomaspark.co/2020/06/the-mad-magazine-fold-in-effec...\n[3] https://web.archive.org/web/20230724221700/https://brendenhy...\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36855278\nPoints: 20\n# Comments: 4",

          "description": "Hi all! Excited to share cc.dev after months of work and refinement.\nThe idea for this product came from trying to do email marketing for my side project, CubeDesk, a site where Rubik's Cube enthusiasts can time themselves, race with one another, train algorithms — it's a fun niche!\nWith over 40k users, sending even a single campaign was becoming expensive with MailChimp. I knew AWS SES would be much cheaper, but it’s just an API with none of the other necessities you need for a robust email marketing platform.\nBeyond cost, I was also frustrated with having to make sure my database was always in sync with MailChimp and the audience schema they enforced. If I wanted to email every user who had completed 10 solves, that would be a whole ordeal and eat up hours of my day.\nSo, I started (and am now launching):\nhttps://cc.dev\ncc.dev connects directly to your database and lets you write SQL queries to target your audience. It's backed by AWS SES, so the cost to send emails is significantly less than what you're used to seeing. Combined with a template builder, media management, and campaign monitoring, cc.dev is meant to be your final destination whenever you need to send marketing emails to your users.\nWould love to hear your feedback on this! If you're interested in trying out cc.dev as your email marketing platform, shoot me an email and let's have a chat: kash at cc.dev\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36836596\nPoints: 183\n# Comments: 77",

          "description": "Hi HN\nA few folks and I have been working on this project for a couple weeks now. After previously working on the Docker project for a number of years (both on the container runtime and image registry side), the recent rise in open source language models made us think something similar needed to exist for large language models too.\nWhile not exactly the same as running linux containers, running LLMs shares quite a few of the same challenges. There are \"base layers\" (e.g. models like Llama 2), specific configuration to run correctly (parameters, temperature, context window sizes etc). There's also embeddings that a model can use at runtime to look up data – we don't support this yet but it's something we're looking at doing soon.\nIt's an early project, and there's still lots to do!\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36802582\nPoints: 142\n# Comments: 50",

          "description": "I quit my job last year and worked mostly on this full SwiftUI rewrite of my Japanese reading app, Manabi Reader. The rewrite gave me the opportunity to expand to macOS (and without Catalyst so it feels extra native) and redo the data layer to be offline-first via Realm with iCloud sync.\nThe biggest differentiators compared with other language study apps are that it tracks every word/kanji you read so that you can see how much of a given webpage/article you're already familiar with and other features/analytics built on that foundation; it automatically builds a personal corpus of example sentences; and that it does all the Japanese tokenization/dictionary lookups locally on-device and in a flexible web browser-like UI with readability mode, to be respectful of your privacy and to work offline.\nI've also added Anki integration. Tap a word, tap another button to save it to Anki with the original source material sentence and URL. I have a Manabi Flashcards app as well if you don't like Anki.\nPacked with free features. See what percent of each article's vocabulary you're familiar with based on your reading history. Scan paragraphs of text with your camera to look up words. Japanese/English dict. Native Japanese web dicts. Look up kanji by drawing. Expanded JLPT levels. RSS. Web browser UI. Save links from other apps. Works offline. Readability mode. Tap words to look them up. Furigana depending on your familiarity with each word.\nFuture plans: besides more features (ePUB, YouTube, mpv player, WaniKani integration, more languages, etc), I’m also preparing the underlying SwiftUI web browser lib as open source and will launch it as a WebKit-based browser/reader option, which I’m excited to get out alongside other interesting recent entrants to the desktop and mobile browser market.\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36674259\nPoints: 62\n# Comments: 30",

Beyond the code, there is likely some value in the extensive and largely complete implementation docs; basic benchmarks are linked in the README, too.\nKind of aiming to be \"the libavl for HAMTs\". That is obviously a high and aspirational bar but a distinct possibility if it stirs up a little interest and/or contribution.\nAnyways, it's time for this to go out, collect feedback and maybe even some use outside of toy projects.

So for any game I release I naturally I want to do the same.\nhttps://github.com/Mknsri/HockeySlam\nHockey Slam is a hockey shootout game on Android which I built almost from scratch. Some of the engine features include 3D graphics with PBR materials, a rudimentary physics system, replays, a multithreaded job system and a hot-reload DLL platform for developing on Windows.\nI detailed the creation of the game in it's own post, but now that time has passed I am releasing the source code and assets under the MIT license. You can still find the making of here: https://hockeyslam.com/makingof\nI'm happy to answer any questions you might have.\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36672183\nPoints: 46\n# Comments: 7",

          "description": "My friend and I have been feeling frustrated at how inefficient it is to find information at work. There are so many tools (Slack, Confluence, GitHub, Jira, Google Drive, etc.) and they provide different (often not great) ways to find information. We thought maybe LLMs could help, so over the last couple months we've been spending a bit of time on the side to build Danswer.\nIt is an open source, self-hosted search tool that allows you to ask questions and get answers across common workspace apps AND your personal documents (via file upload / web scraping)! Full demo here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geNzY1nbCnU&t=2s.\nThe code (https://github.com/danswer-ai/danswer) is open source and permissively licensed (MIT). If you want to try it out, you can set it up locally with just a couple of commands (more details in our docs - https://docs.danswer.dev/introduction). We hope that someone out there finds this useful\nWe’d love to hear from you in our Slack (https://join.slack.com/t/danswer/shared_invite/zt-1u3h3ke3b-...)  or Discord (https://discord.gg/TDJ59cGV2X). Let us know what other features would be useful for you!\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36667374\nPoints: 139\n# Comments: 51",

I really recommend going through the list, it made my day.\n[0] \"Could you share your personal blog here\". https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36575081\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36605493\nPoints: 476\n# Comments: 120",

          "description": "There are existing HN job aggregators, but I thought we could take it a step further.\nInspired by an insightful comment on a previous thread (https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36163021), I built a tool that aggregates job postings and intelligently categorizes them based on user-specific preferences:\n* Country and remote work preferences\n* Employer type (e.g., startup, corporation, government)\n* Industry\n* Technologies used\n* Role type (developer, architect, product owner, etc.)\n* Salary range (where available)\nOne of the superpowers of LLMs is reformatting information from any format X to any other format Y.\nWe leverage this to map all the unstructured job postings into the same unified structure. The new GPT functions feature and the extended context windows are really helpful for this.\nInstead of having to build a custom NER pipeline, it works very well with GPT out-of-the box.\nOne challenge is keeping the filters consistent and merging of duplicates. Embeddings help with that.\nWhat's next:\n* Integrate additional sources. We can generate web scrapers and data processing steps on the fly that extract and transform data into the same structure.\n* Add location distance filters.\n* Expand beyond jobs to monitor personalized data like events or real estate. Imagine using AI to rate local events from multiple sources based on your preferences, considering factors like your interests and distance from home.\n* Smaller improvements based on your feedback :)\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36574090\nPoints: 58\n# Comments: 14",

          "description": "Hi everyone!👋 I am currently studying cybersecurity and learning Linux by using it as a daily driver. But I do use it on my gaming laptop, which is an Lenovo Legion 5 (Ryzen+nvidia) which most of the times is quite uncomfortable to get it with me, as it is quite a heavy laptop and I don’t like to take it with me around the house.Don’t get me wrong, I don’t really want to drop that laptop as I still got one year left to pay for it😅 So.. I am looking for a second laptop for studying and working but I am not sure which model would be a good choice for my budget as a second-hand laptop (around 200£). I am also not sure what tools I might need in the future, on the cybersecurity domain. I don’t really care too much about the display as I won’t take it out the house too much and also I don’t want it to be a beast on performance, just to serve well for at least 2 years from now and to fit around my budget. 🤔 I was looking for Lenovo x1 Carbon, Dell latitudine or ThinkPad T460+ or even the ThinkPads X series. What would u guys recommend? Thanks!🙏🏽😁\n    submitted by    /u/xtcybro  \n [link]   [comments]",

Run your Windows application and then exit the VM, all the while remaining within Linux and without having to reboot.\n The corollary to this approach are those who wish to work predominantly from their Windows desktop and occasionally access their Linux desktop.

Even to this day this 15 year old piece of software blows modern competitors out of the water, besides a couple of AI projects that require an API.\n Unfortunately, this software was bought out by Amazon and thrown behind an expensive API for enterprise use. This is egregious to me. It's quite annoying that literally everything is behind a paid API now. The issue now is that it is on its last leg. Its losing support entirely. Its a 32 bit application and the android APK cant even run on a Pixel 7 (without modification) and its at the end of android support.…",

          "description": "“oom_reaper” is a kernel thread which was created using the “kthread_run” function (https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v6.2.5/source/mm/oom_kill.c#L735). Basically, it is the implementation of the OMM (Out–of-Memory) killer function of the Linux kernel.\n The function which is executed by the thread is “oom_reaper” (https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v6.2.5/source/mm/oom_kill.c#L640) which calls “oom_reap_task” (https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v6.2.5/source/mm/oom_kill.c#L609).\n Based on the documentation the goal of the “oom_reaper” kernel thread is to try and reap the memory used by the OOM victim (https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v6.2.5/source/mm/oom_kill.c#L504). “oom_reaper” sleeps until it is waked up (https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v6.2.5/source/mm/oom_kill.c#L680) which is after OOM kills the process.\n After killing the process the victim is queued so the “oom_reaper” can release the resources (https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v6.2.5/source/mm/oom_kill.c#L992). You can see an example of the log created by OOM after killing a process.\n ​\n https://blog.capdata.fr/index.php/linux-out-of-memory-killer-oom-killer-pour-un-serveur-base-de-donnees-postgresql/\n    submitted by    /u/boutnaru  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I have an environment with a RHEL 8.8 Linux server directly connected to a JBOD via SAS. All the hardware is Supermicro and the storage controllers are modern LSI/Avago/Broadcom and running the latest firmware. The JBOD is configured with 2 types of disks (HDD & SSD).\n In the front of the JBOD there are 24 large (18 TB) WD 7200 RPM datacenter SAS disks and in the back are 20 large (6.4 TB) Seagate Nytro 3235 SAS SSD's. When testing IOPS using IOZONE, the HDD's perform reasonably well, but the IOPS for the SSD's are abysmal.\n So, I decided to put the storage controller in passthrough mode and let ZFS manage the storage. Again, the HDD's are outperforming the SSD's by orders of magnitude across every block size.\n Bewildered, I swapped out the Linux OS disks and installed the latest version of TrueNAS core and now the SSD's are performing more in line with expectations. Debian based TrueNAS Scale is also providing decent results (but not quite as good as the FreeBSD version).\n We're a RHEL Linux shop and would prefer to run everything on RHEL 8 or 9, but if the performance isn't there, then obviously we need to look elsewhere (IXsystems, Netapp, etc.). Unfortunately, we're on a shoestring budget, so rolling our own solutions is often the order of the day.\n Any ideas for why Redhat would perform so badly compared to the FreeBSD and Debian versions of TrueNAS?\n    submitted by    /u/mission-implausable  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "First of all, I know there's a lot of work to be done on HDR but I just want to understand some things about HDR in general and also how it will likely work on Linux.\n 1 . It seems that when using a HDR monitor with SDR content, things can look bad (too much saturation, incorrect colors, washed out etc.) and this isn't Linux specific either. So what people do is limit their monitor to the sRGB color space with some kind of sRGB Emulation mode to work around this issue.\n This is obviously useful for SDR content but now you've just made HDR content look worse, right? So in this situation, is there even any point in having a HDR monitor if you're just going to limit the color space like that? I don't get it..\n 2 . I think Windows can possibly send a signal to the monitor to enable/disable HDR functionality depending on the content being displayed (Not sure on this). Can this/will this be done on Linux?\n 3 . I hear talk of mixed SDR & HDR content being handled on the screen at once. I have no idea how Windows handles this. Again, is this something Linux can/will do?\n Additionally, I'm considering getting a HDR monitor but I'm not a fan of changing monitor settings depending on what I'm doing - I just like to set & forget. Am I going to have to chose between bad looking SDR with HDR enabled or good looking SDR with HDR disabled/severely limited, or can I have the best of both with one setting?\n Thank you.\n    submitted by    /u/LinuxGamer100  \n [link]   [comments]",

And I have to do this for Ubuntu and other distros and their different versions manually.\n I know this might sound like a stupid question to some of the veteran linux driver devs, but I am just getting started on Linux kernel dev and I am still not sure what are the agreed upon approaches for these kind of situations, maybe everyone already knows the answer to my question but I couldn't find it through googling.\n ​\n    submitted by    /u/BitDrill  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Over the last few weeks I've been seeing a frankly concerning amount of questions about Wubuntu and LinuxFX/WindowsFX. First of all, something that many people seem unaware of is that these are actually the same thing. LinuxFX rebranded to Wubuntu, presumably to evade their history of terrible security practices.\n For those unaware of the story of LinuxFX, it was a skinned version of KDE that was designed to mimic Windows as closely as possible. And unfortunately they didn't just stop at making it look like Windows, as they sell activation licenses for \"pro\" version of their OS. All of these licenses were stored on a database that was incredibly easy to breach, and leaked a ton of user information, including user IP addresses. The initial discovery of this was reported here: https://kernal.eu/posts/linuxfx/\n When the news about this became more widespread, they decided to increase their security... by moving the openly accessible database to a different URL. Naturally this was nearly immediately breached again: https://kernal.eu/posts/linuxfx-part-2/\n What's more awful is that the old URL for the database got replaced by a plaintext file, containing the lines \"kernalisdumb\" and \"kernalislammer\" (yes they did even misspell the word \"lamer\"). This weak attempt at insulting the people who have genuine concern for user safety really speaks volumes about the neglect of the LinuxFX developers.\n In fact, the URL for the old database is still online: http://www.linuxfx.org/linuxfx/x86/11.1/.http\n What's even more concerning now is that the aforementioned insults have been replaced again with \"linux896_hacked\", which raises the concern for me that LinuxFX is entirely compromised.\n The idea of a Linux distribution that is familiar to Windows users is enticing, and I see why people are interested in it, but I want everyone to be aware of the dangers that come with Wubuntu/LinuxFX/WindowsFX.\n    submitted by    /u/fox_in_unix_socks  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "If you're a Linux + Thunderbird user, you're most likely concerned about privacy and security and so have setup your e-mail client to only show plain text e-mails by default. Sometimes however, there are e-mails that require you to enable HTML (or at least \"simple\" HTML) to make sense of the contents. If you've gotten such an e-mail, you'd always have to change the global setting via the View menu and then change it back once you've read the e-mail. This is, of course, a bit annoying.\n To circumvent this, in the past you could always make use of the \"Allow HTML temp\" add-on, that provided a one-click method of changing the view mode just for the currently shown e-mail. Unfortunately this add-on does not work anymore since the release of Thunderbird 105. I saw that there was already a feature request for this on Mozilla Connect, but it doesn't have very many votes and is therefore far down the list (and as I understand it, feature requests with more votes are prioritized by the devs).\n That's why I want to ask you to please support this feature request with a vote, so that we may once again enjoy the great Thunderbird with the desired privacy, security and convenience.

          "description": "I posted this on /r/pcbuildhelp but didn't get any bites, so I'm posting here. Hope that's okay.\n This is a weird one. I'm pretty experienced with building PCs, and am also pretty experienced with Linux, but I've never run into this before.\n I'm building a duplicate, part-for-part, of a previous build. The previous build is a NAS running Ubuntu 22.04 LTS, and the new build is intended to be the same, built for a friend. My NAS is great and has given me zero issues, which is why I decided to use the exact same parts again. I specifically chose Ubuntu 22.04 because it's one of the few Linux installers that allows you to install straight to ZFS, which I prefer to use on NAS builds.\n I made a USB installer of Ubuntu 22.04, selected it as the boot device, selected \"try or install Ubuntu,\" and upon the Ubuntu splash screen with a spinning wheel, the wheel spins for a bit and then stops -- the installer freezes and never recovers. I tried safe graphics, and the same thing happened.\n Thinking the problem was the USB drive, I tested the installer on a spare machine, and Ubuntu installed flawlessly.\n I went ahead and wiped the USB drive and added a Debian 11 installer. Same issue as before. Ditto with TrueNAS. Ditto with multiple other distros.\n I've tried other USB drives just in case. I've tried going full UEFI, full legacy/BIOS only, etc. I've updated the BIOS. I've run a memtest for 24 hours with no issues, re-seated the CPU, swapped the GPU, tried editing the GRUB options, and the issue persists.\n At this point it's pretty clearly a hardware issue, but I'm not sure how to troubleshoot whether the problem lies with the motherboard or CPU. Unfortunately the CPU is a Xeon and doesn't have onboard graphics so I can't totally remove a discrete GPU from the equation altogether. I also don't have any spare parts to swap out, unless I take apart my personal NAS, which I'd really prefer to not have to do...\n Any thoughts on where to go from here would be super appreciated!\n    submitted by    /u/rewgs  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hello everyone!\n I've been working on an interesting hobby project for some time and recently released it publicly.\n I call it Lightwhale.\n Lightwhale boots your bare-metal x86 servers straight into Docker!\n It's very minimalistic and strives to be zero-installation, zero-configuration, zero-maintenance, and very easy to use.\n The system is immutable which hardens security and reduces complexity — like how the system is always completely separated from your custom data and configuration.\n A small memory footprint and minimum number of running system processes, allow it to run even on low-power micro-servers. This also means less energy burnt on unnecessary CPU cycles, which makes Lightwhale an excellent choice for sustainable and green-tech efforts.\n Your home lab will love Lightwhale, and probably your business' on-prem enterprise edge-computing server thing too.\n Give it a try, that would be cool. Let me hear your thoughts and opinions; feedback is much appreciated. \n Lightwhale lives here:\n https://lightwhale.asklandd.dk/rlinux\n 🪶🐳💕\n    submitted by    /u/Zta77  \n [link]   [comments]",

Even the touchscreen does something, but just not what I am expecting. I click on the middle of the screen and the mouse moves to the top right of the screen. It needs some form of calibration.\n Can anyone point me into the right direction on how I can calibrate the touchscreen in DSL or recommend any other OS for the i586 architecture where the touchscreen might work better?\n I don’t have much information on the device.

This is extremely frustrating, as I tend to have 50-100 windows open, all grouped into workspaces according to my workflow, and I have multiple offices, each with its own multi-monitor setup. For example, if I want to go to my boss's office to show him some data, I have to unplug my computer and plug it into a Vibe board in his office, but then I lose all my workspaces and it takes a while to find whatever I was working on!\n This is a recognized bug in GNOME, and it seems doubtful it'll be fixed anytime soon.

          "description": "Hi 1st of all. Despite being distro hopping for more than 4 years on Linux (always on intel) and never really sticks to it due to previous workplace requirement on running windows specifics softwares, I'm still very VERY ultra noob when it comes to Linux. So If my questions sounds really stupid, please direct me what to look in order to learn.\n I've recently bought an Asus TUF A15 with Ryzen 7 4800H + RTX 3050 Ti combo. After a week of using it, I have the board fried after running Linux on VM while installing Visual studio in Windows. (My very first time to decide on AMD, had no idea when I jumped in lol)\n The store where I bought it gave me a new unit replacement since it happened on the 6th day after my purchase. (Something about Asus policy saved my ass)\n My question are. I would like to install Linux on this laptop. I've had my success on MSI GF75 Thin 9SC (intel) in controlling my fan speed.\n But for the Asus TUF A15, I understood that AMD SMU are controlling the fan and no way to control them manualy? (Correct me if I'm wrong). (Oh and theres no way to manualy control this in windows too)\n So given my experience on the Asus TUF A15, if I would just swing it and install Linux. Will it cause problems like getting my laptop board fried again? To be honest I can't afford another laptop anymore. 🤣🤣🤣\n I tried installing Mint and Pop OS on a second nvme, everything seems to work for me, nothing I wasn't able to google and fix. However, my concern was the fan/heat. As on my MSI, I would run my python script and it would be hot and I'll just turn my fan to boost mode. I'm afraid to test this on the Asus TBH.\n Man, I hope im not getting roast for this, kinda stupid question 😅\n    submitted by    /u/Sleepy_N_Walking  \n [link]   [comments]",

This'll be called the UHP Open Standard and will run on Windows, Mac and Linux. It'll also be built into Tectonic Marketplace, which will be a Chromium based app meant to allow the user to download and run UHPs. The user can also drag 3rd party UHP files into the app and install them. \n We need people that are familiar with: - the Chromium codebase (!!!) - GTK theming - making Debian applications - basic web development (HTML, CSS, JS)\n If you're interested, get in touch with me either here or on Discord. My username is @kantraa. We can discuss this further if you want and I will add you to our development group. This project is 100% non-profit, so because of that and other things right now there won't be any pay unfortunately. It's driven by pure passion and any future donators once we get started with them in the not so distant future.\n -☢️ K\n    submitted by    /u/Alpha012_GD  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "🚨Tool Release 🚨\n Announcing BucketLoot, an automated S3-compatible Bucket inspector that can help users extract assets, flag secret exposures and even search for custom keywords as well as Regular Expressions from publicly-exposed storage buckets by scanning files that store data in plain text.\n Tool Link: https://github.com/redhuntlabs/BucketLoot\n The tool can scan for buckets deployed on Amazon Web Services (AWS), Google Cloud Storage (GCS), DigitalOcean Spaces and even custom domains/URLs which could be connected to these platforms. It returns the output in a JSON format, thus enabling users to parse it according to their liking or forward it to any other tool for further processing.\n In short, BucketLoot has the following features: 1. Scan for secret exposures 2. Extract assets such as URLs, Subdomains and Domains 3. Search for custom keywords or regex queries \n The tool can help people like bug hunters and penetration testing folks to step up their recon game and go beyond the traditional tools available in the market.\n In case you would like to know more about BucketLoot, make sure to head over to our blog @ RedHunt Labs which gives a brief walkthrough of the tool: https://redhuntlabs.com/blog/introducing-bucketloot-an-automated-cloud-bucket-inspector/\n    submitted by    /u/0x9747  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "VFS (Virtual File System, aka Virtual File Switch) is a software component of Linux which is responsible for the filesystem interface exposed to user-mode applications. Using it allows the kernel to provide an abstraction layer that makes implementation of different filesystems very easy (https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/next/filesystems/vfs.html).\n Overall, VFS is masking the implementation details of a specific filesystem behind generic system calls (open/read/write/close/etc), which are mostly exposed to user-mode application by some wrappers in libc — as shown in the diagram below (https://www.starlab.io/blog/introduction-to-the-linux-virtual-filesystem-vfs-part-i-a-high-level-tour).\n Moreover, we can say that the main goal of VFS is to allow user-mode applications to access different filesystems (think about NTFS, FAT, etc.) in the same way. There are four main objects in VFS: superblock, dentries, inodes and files (https://www.win.tue.nl/~aeb/linux/lk/lk-8.html).\n Thus, “inode” (https://medium.com/@boutnaru/linux-what-is-an-inode-7ba47a519940) is what the kernel uses to keep track of files. Because a file can have several names there are “dentries” (“directory entries”) which represent pathnames. Also, due to the fact a couple of processes can have the same file opened (for read/write) there is a “file” structure that holds the information for each one (such as the cursor position). The “superblock” structure holds data which is needed for performing actions on the filesystem — more details about all of those and more (like mounting) are going to be published in the near future.\n Lastly, there are also other relevant data structures that I will post on in the near future (“filesystem”, “vfsmount”, “nameidata” and “address_space”).\n ​\n https://www.starlab.io/blog/introduction-to-the-linux-virtual-filesystem-vfs-part-i-a-high-level-tour\n    submitted by    /u/boutnaru  \n [link]   [comments]",

Unfortunately, with Wayland XScreensaver doesn't work so well and for that I don't blame the package as it simply is not implemented for Wayland in any manner.\n Don't get me wrong, there is something to be said for a system going into a semi-sleep mode when GNOME blanks the screen and the system becomes idle and the internal temperature is lowered by a lot. It is quite useful but also quite boring, and yes, I am aware of the goal of saving power for various reasons. Still, though, I've been entertained over the years by the sheer multitude of screen savers included in the package and enjoy watching them cycle along every few minutes or so. I also don't mind if the screen saver package blanks the screen after a half hour or so (user configurable, of course). At least with a screen saver I know my system hasn't crashed!\n Perhaps the limitation is technical and Wayland doesn't have the API that would permit a screen saver to work as it can on X.

Sadly, in the past year I've been experiencing a lot of small problems when updating my system (I use arch by the way, and before you blame that, keep in mind keeping things up to date with upstream is not beta, those project I assume test to the best of their abilities). Anyway, for example here are some issues I've had:\n - gtk issues (e.g. file chooser widget crash), that got patched a few days later.\n - SDL 2 crash on fullscreen issues, that got patched a few weeks later\n More recently:\n - Steam did a big update on their desktop ui and now I have to hold ctrl when mouse clicking widgets. Super annoying.\n - Anything going fullscreen is now having hiccups.\n So I googled what desktop environment steam deck uses, figuring that at least will get tested. So I installed kde-plasma-x11. The steam ctrl workaround is not necessary under that DE. And fullscreen doesn't hiccup. But I hate plasma. Everything is super slow to launch (i.e. 2 seconds). Worst, installing kde screwed up my configs and openbox is ugly now, and tracker3 is misbehaving so openging nautilus in openbox takes 10 seconds. I don't want to fix that issue because Steam and fullscreen still misbehave at the time of writing when I use openbox.\n I thought openbox was super stable, and the whole point of it was an exercice in writing a X11 compliant window manager. Is KDE full of non standard hack, which is why it works well while openbox doesn't? Or is there bugs in openbox that just will never get fixed and I should ditch it. Anyway. I know, this is a rant now. But my computer was running nice under it, and now it's not enjoyable under kde.

          "description": "I recently switched to linux (ubuntu) and it's incredible to see how efficient the memory management is. Initially, installed it just for the change and dual booted it alongside windows.\n With windows 10 it always felt like I was running out of RAM, for example running google earth almost takes 6-7 GiB and would crash in few minutes with some error(memory leakage?), whereas in ubuntu it works as long as i want without crashing and RAM usage remains well below 4GiB, also, youtube 2k videos play without stuttering.\n A regular user might think of upgrading RAM, and if you contact tech support they'll also advise to upgrade memory but surprisingly, this was never a hardware problem but a software one!\n I can never think of going back to Windows until they fix their memory issues.

I am asking here because of the linux/mainboard issue.\n So, when I shutdown my pc it's sometimes stuck in a white text saying that the system is shutting down but still remains turned on. That happend over night and now my graphics card is not useable anymore. I've read somewhen that this is a mainboard issue with linux which is why I would prefer to also replace the mainboard.

          "description": "I've been using a dual boot setup with Arch and Ubuntu on my system, and I've noticed an interesting issue. Among the various popular Linux distributions I've tried, it seems that only Ubuntu can handle more resources effectively. I'll provide some details:\n  \nRAM: 4 GB\n Processor: Intel Core i5 8th gen\n GPU 1: Intel UHD 620\n GPU 2: AMD Radeon 520 (Unfortunately, it doesn't work correctly on any Linux distro, including Ubuntu)\n Storage: SSD\n  \nSpecifically, when it comes to resource-intensive tasks like running the Free and Open Source game 0.A.D. or using the Matlab software, only Ubuntu seems to handle them without any issues. However, on other distros like Arch, Debian, and Fedora, running these applications causes freezes and performance problems.\n On the other hand, for simple and lightweight tasks, I haven't experienced any problems on any of the mentioned distros.\n I'm curious to know why this discrepancy exists. Has anyone else encountered similar resource handling differences among various Linux distributions?\n    submitted by    /u/Lonely-Maximum-3750  \n [link]   [comments]",

As far as i know Arch Linux with its official repositories and AUR has one of the largest package base leaving aside NixOS which is different on its own and is its own league. Debian boasts one of the largest official binary package database. Ubuntu hosts its own repositories and PopOS which is based on Ubuntu its seems is hosting its own repositories too. Fedora also has official as well as community repositories but its package collection is rather smaller than others.\n Flatpak, Snap, AppImage transcends the Distro packaging scheme and are standalone application pacakagers. They are their own base and are distroindependent. I don't know package count on them as they can be pretty susceptible to spaming. They also solve binary distribution problem for proprietary vendors and add useful features like sandboxing and portals generally enhancing the supposed security of the system. \n    submitted by    /u/Own_Language7325  \n [link]   [comments]",

And there seem to be so many competing magical solutions that I don't even know where to start.\n So if I wanted to run say the new Hitman games, and say, Sim Tower or Caesar 3, and also Halo Infinite, what's the best super magical doohickey these days?

I’m forced to use windows as a scientific workstation on my work computer as a government data scientist and I completely understand why, and I have no expectations that Linux will “win on the desktop”, because it doesn’t need to.\n Despite so many Linux fans out there thinking really hard /s about how the community can best strategize to have a completely open hardware and software platform take over households across the world, in all use cases, especially the ones the Linux kernel is least suited for (like RTOS applications directing self driving cars, and, no the driving subsystems of Tesla don’t run on linux, the infotainment system does), we still have really nice linux things!\n On my desktop, I can run hyprland basically flawlessly with my 3070 using proprietary nvidia drivers. I just got a steam deck and now I can play all of my favorite video games on my couch in 4K on my big ol TV with a wireless controller. I still use a pretty locked down andoid phone for many things (though an iPhone for daily use because privacy). I have a raspberry pi to serve as the data collection backend for my home brewed weather station. My TV and both of my partners TVs have Linux as their smart TV OS.\n All of these things are a mix of GPLed software and binary blobs/closed source elements. It’s amazing just how robust the corporate environment for Linux really is and how it drives innovation and competition.\n And Debian is also a thing, I guess. Kinda.\n The truly best thing about Linux is how all the really serious developers aren’t ESR or RMS. They’re actually rational, successful people. The zealots lost the argument and we’re all better for it.\n It’s nice to have nice things.\n    submitted by    /u/sp0rk173  \n [link]   [comments]",

I'm curious to know if this would be a good and powerful choice for running Linux smoothly. I understand that Linux doesn't necessarily require a high-end processor to perform well, but I value your input on this matter. The reason behind my inquiry is that my current laptop, which is equipped with an NVIDIA RTX 3070, tends to encounter occasional issues after software updates...\n Considering these factors, I'm contemplating a switch to an AMD-based system. Hence, I would greatly appreciate hearing your thoughts and opinions on AMD processors and their compatibility with Linux.\n As for my background, I am a simple user who is currently studying IT. I spend my free time coding and playing casual games. \n Here is the link of this new laptop: https://wccftech.com/xiaomi-unveils-redmibook-pro-15-ryzen-edition-laptop-amd-ryzen-7-7840hs-apu/\n Thank you\n    submitted by    /u/mavinii  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Ever since I started seriously using Linux a few years ago, I always used Wayland. I really liked Fedora, so I used GNOME on Wayland, I also tried using KDE for a while, but that was also on Wayland. Overall, I barely touched Xorg during this entire time. I tried booting GNOME on Xorg but my touchpad gestures stopped working, so I immediately turned it off. Why bother with it if it's the outdated display server?\n Through my Linux experience, I discovered many issues - I desperately needed fractional scaling on my 14 inch 1080p laptop, which was always a blurry nightmare and I never managed to make it usable. I also experienced some visual glitches, like windows disappearing on GNOME with multiple monitors, etc. and I always figured that that's just what the Linux experience is like.\n Fast forward to a few days ago, when I installed Arch with the i3 window manager, the first environment running on Xorg that I've seriously used. And wow. So many issues are just gone, or at least very solvable. None of my apps are blurry with fractional scaling. Everything is smooth and looks good. It's like a different world.\n Wayland has some very cool features, like the responsive touchpad gestures, and it's definitely great for the future of Linux. As of now, if you're also bothered by the issues I was, consider giving them up for a way smoother and reliable desktop experience.\n    submitted by    /u/azdrawee  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hey guys\n I am using cron to take care of backups. I was worried that cron might fail at some point, and I wouldn't be aware of it. To mitigate this risk, I created a script called MoniCron, which monitors the state of cron. \n You can find the script on GitHub here: https://github.com/hkarakose/monicron\n To provide a detailed explanation of how the script works and how to use it, I wrote a blog post on Medium. You can check it out here: https://medium.com/@hkarakose/keep-your-cron-entries-safe-37fd33b2667e\n I believe this script could be helpful for others who rely on cron for their backups. I welcome your comments and suggestions to further improve it.\n Thank you for your time!\n    submitted by    /u/Charming-Idea-2021  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I see many people talking about choosing the right hardware to run Linux and I always thought there were exaggerating. I was so wrong.\n Recently I decided to build a new PC and since I was using Linux on my laptop I thought \"Well, if I am building a new machine why not make it fully compatible with Linux?\"\n So I did it. Every single part of my build has good support for Linux. AMD Ryzen, ATI Radeon, etc., etc... I could not be happier. Everything works just as it was supposed to. I am running Fedora with Wayland and it has been an amazing experience.\n Newcomers to Linux should know that: If you just bought your PC it probably was designed to run Windows or MAC. Most companies do not care about Linux (yes, I am talking to you Nvdia). It does not mean that it won't run Linux, it just means that it has a great chance of not being a good experience and random problems will happen. Everything on Linux was made by people who dedicate some of their time to making things work because companies do not. They do an amazing job, but it is not the same as having all info necessary. Sure, your system can run very well, but it will never be as good as a well-thought Linux-compatible PC.\n You do not have to build one. Just find a company that sells laptops for example with full Linux support and you will be amazed by how good it is .\n ​\n TL;DR: To get the whole Linux experience you have to care about hardware as well. \n    submitted by    /u/colutti  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hi! I have a laptop which I use once in a while, but I will use it constantly in august, and which at the moment runs Fedora 38. I am not liking it that much and I want to change. Since I don't have a regular connection I prefer a distro that doesn't update as much as a rolling release. So I am uncertain between Opensuse Leap (whivh I never user, I am a Tumbeweed user in another laptop) and MxLinux, which I used some time ago and found really good. MxLinux 23 is still in beta, but Opensuse Leap has an uncertain future, as far as I understood (or am I wrong?). \n So, what do you suggest? Leap or MxLinux 23 still in beta?\n Thank you for any suggestion Paola\n    submitted by    /u/paolab79  \n [link]   [comments]",

Even though I'm sure about this change, I can't decide wich distro use. So far the only thing I'm sure about is that I'll choose an ubuntu based one.\n On my research I narrowed down to 2 options: Pop os and Zorin os.\n The thing that bums me out about Zorin Os is the fact that Zorin Group seems to take a lot of time to release a new update to their OS. And the thing that bums me out about Pop os is that they're about to change gnome for cosmic, and I don't know what to expect from this change. Will it be worse than gnome? I don't really know.\n But after all, I realize that for coding I won't have any big difference between theese two or any other distro. I just want to go for the one with the easiest usage for my daily activities.\n ​\n ** I'm Brazilian so I apologize for any grammar mistake, English is not my mother tongue.

I think it is a huge vulnerability.\n I made some minimal changes to the installation, like installing one or two packages and updating. So it isn't hard to reinstall and set everything up again. The problem is I am afraid it will cause additional writes to SSD and therefore reducing lifespan. (I know it's negligible and the one I am using isn't from a random brand.)\n So, is it worth it to perform a reinstall with encryption? Also what encryption should I use as a balance between performance and security?\n Btw, should I encrypt the EFI partition (/boot/efi) on the external SSD?

Some of the major improvements include:\n  \nExpanded Collection: Explore over 400 distro versions, including various End-of-Life releases \n Internet is enabled for signed-in users (most requests was for this). It's now possible download and install software packages in the VM.\n Better usability on small screen devices, allowing keyboard input and easy scrolling the VM screen.\n Login credentials and instructions are displayed for some distros to easily enter into live mode\n Improvements to minimize latency while accessing VMs.\n  \nI have also received requests to enable disks in the VMs to try out the installation process. However, it is not currently feasible due to cost concerns.\n Many thanks to everyone who donated and sent their valuable suggestions. I hope you all will find the updates useful. Check it out now at DistroSea- Test drive Linux distros online\n Note: Do not access personal data inside the VMs. Please shutdown the VM after use to immediately allocate the server resources for another user.\n I'm currently looking for sponsors. Please get in touch if you are interested in backing my work.\n    submitted by    /u/basilky  \n [link]   [comments]",

I posted my write-up online[1] and was discussing it on Reddit[2], among other places.\n It seems, however, that Office 365 is rendering quite a few of Calibri Regular characters, but not Calibri Light, using Lato on Linux systems. This doesn't affect MacOS, which doesn't have Calibri installed by default, nor Calibri Light, which looks and works as expected on Office 365 also when accessed from Linux Systems.\n Can some of you friendly folk with access to Office 356 upload a screenshot of what you see when you format the words \"Calibri Regular\" with Calibri and Calibri Light on Word (at 18px) and Power Point (at 96px)?\n The curiosity is killing us :)\n Thanks !\n [1] https://jdsalaro.com/note/comparison-new-microsoft-default-font-calibri-aptos/\n [2] https://www.reddit.com/r/typography/comments/14zenfg/a_quick_look_into_microsofts_new_default_font/\n    submitted by    /u/jdsalaro  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "TL;DR Just some venting about a broken installation...\n My Arch installation just broke some hours ago. Working like a charm for quite some time now, this is the first major issue (besides those pesky Nvidia drivers) I encountered. And, to be honest, I have absolutely no idea what happened, my PC seemingly decided to not recognize the SSD as something it should boot from anymore. My first attempt at fixing this was checking the GPT / MBR and partitions with a Ubuntu live-installation using gdisk, which promptly complained that the EFI partition was not aligned properly. Wondered (still do) how that happened but proceeded to fix it with parted. I also mounted the partitions to check whether some important files were missing or corrupted, but everything was normal. With the GPT being valid, all partitions aligned and working and the boot flags set where needed I though my work was done and blissedly rebooted. Of course it didn't work. I unplugged every other drive that could somehow get in the way in the boot order (my PC is sometimes a bit whacky in regards to that), still not working. Then it occurred to me that maybe GRUB was somehow damaged and it could not load the 2nd or even 1st stage or something like that (I had used grub-install just before it broke down, but neither on the drive nor the partitions in question). Back on the Ubuntu I checked for that but it seems to be fine. As of now I currently contemplate whether it is worth to fiddle around some more or if it'd be better to just re-install and then restore my data.\n    submitted by    /u/Valcalen  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "To access the OpenVPN server on your Synology device from outside the mobile operator's network, you need to set up proper port forwarding on the router that is connected to the mobile operator's network. Here are some steps to take:\n  \nSet up an OpenVPN server on your Synology device using the DSM admin interface. Make sure all necessary settings are configured, such as IP addresses, authentication protocols, and certificates.\n \nOn the router that is connected to the mobile operator's network, you need to forward the OpenVPN ports to the IP address of your Synology device. The standard OpenVPN port is 1194 (UDP). Check your router's manual for how to set up port forwarding.\n \nFor mobile carriers, you may also need to set up network address translation (NAT) on your router to redirect traffic from the external network to your Synology device's IP address on your local network. Consult your mobile operator's documentation or support for specific NAT setup instructions.\n \nMake sure the OpenVPN server is running on your Synology device.\n \n After completing these steps, you should be able to connect to the OpenVPN server on your Synology device from outside your mobile operator's network using the public IP address or dynamic DNS assigned to your router.\n It is also worth remembering that some mobile operators may block certain ports or protocols, which may make it difficult to access from outside. In this case, contact your mobile operator for more information on restrictions and how to bypass them.\n    submitted by    /u/maciej1993  \n [link]   [comments]",

I struggled with a few things such as scrolling files off screen, hovering them properly, resetting cursor position, etc. I've since learned more and implemented all my knowledge. This time around I made a push and pop implementation for bash, in bash, which made writing this file manager much easier. I wrote this to increase my productivity on the commandline; This allows me to navigates files much quicker and edit them without any trouble, no more worrying about copy/pasting names, remembering them or using wildcards to make up the difference. Instead of ls, cd, EDITOR, pwd, etc - They are handled by simply using the arrow keys or H, J, K, L respectively\n This is a compelete rewrite focused on stability, simplicity and design before continuing on to features. Majority of the fearures mentioned in the README.md are not implemented yet (adding more features is not hard). Anyway, I'm curious what everyone thinks about it; If you'd use it, what could change, etc. Any testers, contributions or feedback is really, much appreciated!\n    submitted by    /u/wick3dr0se  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "You might have heard the news that China has released a homegrown Linux distro dubbed OpenKylin. I know very well that stuff made-in-China (especially those labeled \"independently created\") can be pretty sloppy in implementation details. So consider this post \"how not to properly configure a Linux system\". Here we go:\n  \nThe ISO archive doesn't have checksums. MD5 values are available at the official website\n Some common CLI utilities (less, man) are not installed by default.\n I've received two system upgrades since fresh install. Both upgrades are tagged w/ version 602.0001 and share the same patch notes. The version number cannot be found in dpkg -l. There must be another package management mechanism running. \n ...and it's definitely not Flatpak. Although Flatpak is preinstalled, no remotes (not even flathub) are preconfigured\n \n APT is configured w/ APT::Get::AllowUnauthenticated=true, effectively bypasses package signing. \n Combining the fact that the default APT repository is accessed via plain-text HTTP, this is wide open to man-in-the-middle attacks.\n \n Docker is preinstalled and enabled. The Docker bridge network is configured as \"bip\": \"128.128.0.1/16\". You can't access this part of the Internet anymore.\n (Important) packages can be outdated. ca-certificates is at version 20190110 which is four years old.\n /etc/localtime is a symlink to /usr/share/zoneinfo/Asia/Shanghai but the content of /etc/timezone is Etc/UTC.\n Proprietary packages (e.g. nvidia-driver-510) can be installed via apt without editing the default sources.list. I guess they don't have to worry about legal issues.\n Like Ubuntu, systemd-resolved is the default DNS service. But theres' also a dnsmasq service enabled, listening to 127.0.0.1:53 with the default upstream set to 114.114.114.114 (provided by www.114dns.com) \n Though systemd-resolved is running with stock config file. No custom upstream configured.\n \n  \nFeel free to ask me for stuff that you are curious about.\n    submitted by    /u/ImaginaryMarketing  \n [link]   [comments]",

I was wondering if anyone could recommend something that has these features. \n 1 - Wayland Support\n 2 - Rolling Updates/Releases\n 3 - KDE Support(I can normally add this myself)\n 4 - DNF or APT (ANYTHING but pacman. I hate pacman) \n I have considered Rocky Linux or Fedora. But I am not sure how good the Wayland support in either of those are right now. I am currently running this. I am wanting to setup a highly customized system that I can compile the Kernel for myself. I used Gentoo for a bit but I occasionally need to use programs for work that are on Linux but dont have all open source binaries and I am then limited to RPM/DEB packages.. Having to compile everything from source or be forced to use snap / flatpaks is a no go for me.. If I could use DEB or RPM packages I would stick with Gentoo. Also please excuse my ugly KDE ui.

          "description": "This is something that I’ve recently have thought about as I’m getting ready to graduate in a few months with an engineering degree, and looking back at my time of switching to Linux full time. Outside of certain software that did require windows, I have, for the most part, successfully did everything that I’ve needed to with Linux, including using LTSpice and Matlab. Speaking with other engineering students, as the topic of windows beginning to become a subscription was being discussed, why not look into using Linux instead, and they responded as it was unnecessary, and they felt it’s too much. \n What I am wondering, is whether having experience with Linux is inevitably beneficial, outside of any CS/E degrees, and whether it makes a difference in the end for non CS/E engineers?\n Edit: thank you for who have responded, I am referring to any engineering field outside of Computer Science/Computer Engineering\n    submitted by    /u/EETQuestions  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "A year ago today, I wrote a journal entry making plans to end everything. It wasn't the first such entry, either. I was deeply addicted to gaming, sinking lower and lower, year by year. I was a complete loser, life was challenging and depressing, and I couldn't feel any joy.\n Then, in one computer science lecture, the professor was talking about Linux, and mentioned, “Linux is an important OS for computer science. But I don't think any of you should install it, because it will break your computer, unless you know what you're doing.”\n I had heard of Linux, but used to dismiss it as a niche OS. Curiosity got the better of me, and I decided to try it out anyway, my first distro being Ubuntu. I was amazed how well it ran compared to Windows. I was also learning new stuff and customizing things left and right.\n Even more amazingly, I felt joy for the first time in a long time. Real joy.\n However, I didn't know what I was doing, and broke my computer just as the professor foretold. I had to reinstall Ubuntu many times. During one of these reinstall, I accidentally wiped the entire disk, including the Windows installation I was dual-booting to play my games.\n The enjoyment I got from using and customizing Linux, combined with a laziness to install Windows, was exactly what I needed to eventually get rid of my gaming addiction. It had a hold over me for over a decade, and I was finally free. Linux also led the way to me rediscovering some of my older hobbies, as well as restoring my enjoyment of coding.\n Now, one year from that journal entry, life is still incredibly difficult and overwhelming at times, but I have regained hope. And I find joy in my activities, not the least of which is simply using my computer running Linux. Linux saved my life and turned it around. I am eternally grateful.\n    submitted by    /u/_Aetos  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I've had quite the long think about what RHEL has been doing to the open source projects a great many of us know and love (first CentOS, now Alma, Rocky, etc.) and I think the problem is summed up like this: \"Line goes up\"\n If a publicly traded company is behind an open source project, that open source project is at risk because, line must go up. They will make up any excuse why the line is not going up and make terrible decisions to hopefully make the line go up.\n I've been a CentOS user for years and now a rocky linux user, but I think it's time to leave that flavor behind entirely. So with that in mind I was looking at other options, Ubuntu being one of them because of the option for enterprise support, but there it is again \"Line goes up\".\n This is why I intend to switch to Debian 12, the latest long term supported version of Debian. Debian is bona fide community run open source project with no profit margins, shareholders, executives, etc. Therefore for Debian there is no line that must go up.\n I implore you as Linux lovers and enjoyers to switch to a distribution in no way tied to a company or gets source from a company and return to the community backed projects that made Linux what it is today.\n Edit: it's surprising to me people still don't know what the issue is.

          "description": "One often stated premise as to why the GPLv2 and certain licenses deemed incompatible by the community is: dynamic linking obviously creates a derived work.\n See for instance the Software Freedom Conservancy's view:\n  \nThe FSF, stewards of the GPL, have stated many times over the past decades that they believe there is no legal distinction between dynamic and static linking of a C program and we agree.\n  \nBut is there any solid reason to believe this is the case? Any case law? Any reasoning from similar facts?\n Because my admittedly shallow view is -- I'm just not sure a copyright license has this kind of power.\n Imagine an extreme case, you build some software which links to MegaEvil Corp's libc, which license specifically states, if you dynamically link to this libc, your work is a derived work of MegaCorp libc, and you forfeit all claims of copyright of your work to MegaEvil Corp. My guess is many courts would say building any such software at an API boundary would be fair use, and copyright law simply does not grant any court the power to enforce this copyright term.\n Why might I guess this is the case? Because courts have actually taken similar positions several times re: software fair use. See, Sega Enterprises Ltd. v. Accolade, Inc., 977 F.2d 1510 (9th Cir. 1992), and Lewis Galoob Toys, Inc. v. Nintendo of America, Inc., 780 F. Supp. 1283 (N.D. Cal. 1991).\n But much worse than the SFC and FSF simply being incorrect is, I worry they either 1) don't know any better or are 2) purposefully misleading users about what the GPL says, and how copyright law works. By encouraging a cramped reading of the GPL and ignoring copyright fair use, they are actually making it harder to build software which interoperates with other software (see ZFS and Linux), and, while the FSF seemed to take Google's side in the Oracle v. Google case, their reasoning re: dynamic linking puts them squarely within Oracle's intellectual camp with respect to copyright fair use.\n    submitted by    /u/small_kimono  \n [link]   [comments]",

However, I need to make use of AutoCAD for several of my classes, and I imagine the same is true in the professional setting. I'm aware of the existence of alternatives such as LibreCAD and FreeCAD, but from what I understand these alternatives are not up to industry standards at this point in time.\n Is virtualization up to the point where I can viably use it to run the software I need?

From other posts, I have seen that you typically get the take-home test after an HR call. But my stages went like this: written assessment -> IQ test -> take-home assessment. So I did 3 rounds with them without talking to a human.\n They rejected me with a template email that they send to everyone. I expect at least some feedback after a non-trivial take-home assessment and multiple rounds. They said they can't provide feedback because of the large volume of applicants (that seems unlikely. I see this position posted on LinkedIn every week and it gets 3 applicants on a good week). Can any of you check my assessment and give me some feedback on it, please?\n Project: Github link (the problem statement is there, it is a client-server application where the server verifies the X509 certificate of the client)\n P.S.

She said what am I doing with my computer and I just said installing Linux which was HORRIBLE to her. She said I was breaking my PC with unknown software.\n I tried to explain what linux was saying it's an open-source competitor to windows and it was safe nor damaging anything. Apparently I needed further justification so I stated (I use a cracked version of windows) it had more customizability, offered more safety and privacy. Apparently I have 'something to hide' for context I have a history of anxiety & psychosis which is known to her.\n Eventually she looked up what linux was: 'All the top results said it was great but when I scrolled down it said tor was used for terrorist, drug deals and various other crimes. She didn't even notice that tor and linux was different from 5 minutes of research. I tried to argue saying it was cherry-picked and a scandal by the media to which and I kid you not she compared me to flat earthers. I know tor & linux are used for crime but jesus christ that's a jump.\n She threatened to take my computer away which I am not a child (later years of HS), I guess she thinks I'm psychotic for wanting privacy for f*ck sakes.\n Also throwaway because if she found my main and my slightly-deviant opinions on various topics I might as well write a note saying goodbye.\n PS: Tips on hiding Linux are greatly appreciated and programs to encrypt my drives.

          "description": "An inode (aka index node) is a data structure used by Unix/Linux like filesystems in order to describe a filesystem object. Such an object could be a file or a directory. Every inode stores pointers to the disk block’s locations of the object’s data and metadata (https://www.bluematador.com/blog/what-is-an-inode-and-what-are-they-used-for). An illustration of that is shown below.\n Overall, the metadata contained in an inode is: file type (regular file/directory/symbolic link/block special file/character special file/etc), permissions, owner id, group id, size, last accessed time, last modified time, creation time and number of hard links (https://www.stackscale.com/blog/inodes-linux/).\n By using inodes the filesystem tracks all files/directories saved on disk. Also, by using inodes we can read any specific byte in the data of a file very effectively. We can see the number of total inodes per mounted filesystem using the command “df -i” (https://linux.die.net/man/1/df). Also, we can see the inode of a file/directory and other metadata of the file using the command “ls -i” (https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/ls.1.html) or “stat” (https://linux.die.net/man/1/stat). By the way, the “stat” command uses the “stat” syscall (https://linux.die.net/man/2/stat).\n Lastly, you can check out “struct inode” in the source code of the Linux kernel (https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v6.4.2/source/include/linux/fs.h#L612). Not all the points/links are directly connected to the data blocks, however I will elaborate on that in a future writeup. \n ​\n https://www.sobyte.net/post/2022-05/linux-inode/\n    submitted by    /u/boutnaru  \n [link]   [comments]",

I am among the few lucky devs that are allowed to have a Linux machine, where I am running Ubuntu 22.04 LTS. This setup mostly works great for me, however the MS Teams Client is a real painpoint. I can live without features present in the windows client like background blur/image, reactions in a call, and sharing single windows, but the horrible effect on system responsiveness that Teams produces is not bearable. When I'm in a call my machine becomes noticably less snappy, which does not happen for my colleagues with windows machines. Turning off my camera seems to help as does disabling incoming video. Every time I share screen my machine becomes very laggy and everything happens in slow motion. The internet is mostly along the lines of \"you will have to live with that\", so: Does anyone here have similar experiences? Are there any tweaks that helped you resolve these issues? Any other directions I could look into?\n    submitted by    /u/DiffUser123  \n [link]   [comments]",

Nothing was included. Every single basic step involved running into roadblocks, researching them, trying out various solutions and experimenting to get it working. And some things never worked.\n Wifi? - no driver for my wifi adapter. Have to install a driver, and it has missing dependencies.\n Bluetooth? - no bluetooth software. Have to figure it out too.\n Samba? - No samba client. No samba server. Have to set it up by editing conf files. Never got it working right.\n FTP? - No FTP. Have to set it up. More conf files. Never got it working right.\n Don't want the computer to go to sleep? More conf files.\n Anyway ... after a few days of this I gave up, installed Ubuntu and got everything set up easily in a few hours.\n Nevertheless -- I take seriously people's criticisms of the direction Ubuntu is going in. So my question is -- is there another distro out there that won't have me tearing my hair out? That includes the basic functionality of a modern OS?\n I'm very distrustful of the distro \"round-ups\" online, because none of them gave me any indication of what a DIY nightmare Debian was.\n    submitted by    /u/icelandic_toe_thumb  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hello,\n I find myself questioning whether using GUI is actually a good thing. I've seen people online making videos about how tiling window managers are undermining your productivity, and that things like it are just a distraction. A regular person is/should incapable of multitasking when they are focussed on let's say, programming.\n There's further discussions to be had about stripping any shell/terminal of syntax highlighting, as well as code syntax highlighting, and having everything be the same color.\n I'm mainly concerned with this as I am trying to find a way to use linux to train myself to become a better programmer, and to function in a development environment where GUIless is the standard.\n Another frequent problem is that GUI adjacent stuff always sparks a lot of conversation and I want to ideally have an environment that is as neutral and unexpressive as possible, because I don't want any slight hint of expression of personality ruining my job prospects. For this reason I always stick to default color themes and fonts, because these choices were made for me, and therefore by not changing them I am not expressing any opinion. My job is to do my job.\n How is this looked upon in industries where people use linux distros in production? I really need to commit to something that is objectively as non-offensive as possible. I do not want to get yelled at.\n I hope someone can share some insight, and recommend a distro that's focussed on GUIless, probably.\n    submitted by    /u/SomebodyInACity  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "The kernel thread “inet_frag_wq” is created using a workqueue (https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v6.2-rc1/source/net/ipv4/inet_fragment.c#L211), we could have guessed it based on a workqueue do to the “wq” suffix. It is used for fragment management of IP packets. Thus the goal of “inet_frag_wq” is to reassemble fragmented IPv4/IPv6 packets (https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v6.2-rc1/source/net/ipv4/inet_fragment.c#L6).\n Overall, the goal of IP fragmentation is to split packets into smaller chunks in order to allow them to meet the MTU (Maximum Transmission Unit) requirement of a specific network. There is an implementation difference between IP fragmentation in IPv4 and IPv6. On IPv4 the information needed for fragmentation is part of the IPv4 header which in IPv6 there is a specific “Fragmentation Header” (https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/ipv6-fragmentation-header/). An illustration of the flow is shown in the diagram below both for IPv4 and IPv6.\n Thus, “inet_frag_wq” is relevant when a fragmented IP packet arrives at a specific system. The OS stores the fragmented packets in a queue and reassembles them before they are passing the data to the upper layers of the network stack. The fragment queue is represented by \"struct inet_frag_queue\" (https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v6.2-rc1/source/include/net/inet_frag.h#L66). \n Moreover, we can see in the source code the function “ip_frag_reasm” which is responsible for building a new IP datagram from all of its fragments (https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v6.2-rc1/source/net/ipv4/ip_fragment.c#L411). \n https://notes.shichao.io/tcpv1/ch10/, https://blog.quarkslab.com/analysis-of-a-windows-ipv6-fragmentation-vulnerability-cve-2021-24086.html \n ​\n ​\n    submitted by    /u/boutnaru  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I'm in the process of trying to organize my tools and I'm looking for a tool tracking software I can use to keep track of what tools I have, and where I've put them. For example, I know I've got a pipe cutter, but I can't find it because the last time I used it I put it away in this toolbox instead of that one. The next time I go looking for the pipe cutter, I might spend an hour looking for it or just give up and borrow/buy a new one. This is in an effort to de-clutter and organize my work area(s). \n I would prefer something other than a spreadsheet.\n Preferably I would like to be able to barcode label my stuff, so when I'm working on a project, I can scan the barcode, and it will tell me where I am supposed to put the tool away. Also, something that I can search \"Screwdriver\" and it will show me list of all my screwdrivers, where they are (or are at least supposed to be), and maybe have a picture.\n Most of the software programs/solutions I've been able to find are geared more towards business inventory that is to be sold/shipped/replenished/...etc. I don't need (or really want) a cloud solution, and I definitely don't want a subscription service - or really anything I have to pay for.\n Any suggestions? Anybody found a solution that works for them?\n Thanks!\n    submitted by    /u/raxxter  \n [link]   [comments]",

I didn't have a full backup so I decided to take the risk and install Ubuntu on the new SSD.\n I am delighted with the functionality under Ubuntu and Gnome, AND the stability of the machine has gone up to near perfect.\n Of course, everyone has difference experiences, but I wanted to share that you CAN win with using linux (Ubuntu) on a laptop over Windows... particularly for stability over Windows.\n Have a great day!\n    submitted by    /u/ReginaMulvinaLunt  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "As a person who has used both Windows, Mac and Linux, I have come to the conclusion that this is the time for me and others to switch to Linux. I am in control of what I do; in Linux the majority of distros have no ads, and no \"reccomended settings\" that Microsoft tries to get you to use to sell more personal info. Trying to install Windows 11 got my computer in a boot loop and had to take out a battery underneath my gpu (I am very inexperienced with the physical side of computers) so I have given up hope for Windows. I will still have a Windows 10 VM for special windows apps that don't work with Wine - but Linux is getting a lot more recognition than it had in the past.\n    submitted by    /u/GoofyGooberForgor  \n [link]   [comments]",

People I know are tired of me using any excuse to all over it. lol\n  \n My career has stalled out a little bit this month and its time for me to rethink what I want to do with my life. I have over a decade of experience as a full stack web developer so I have a good understanding of the basics of programming. I've even maintained a few Linux web servers but didn't do anything special to configure them.\n  \n Even in IT, everyone is convinced that you need to be big brained to have anything to do with Linux so there aren't tons of people out there that know how to use it. It makes me wonder what I would have to learn to pivot into being a system admin or something. I don't know. This whole thing is an idea that just popped into my head 10 min ago so I am still figuring things out. Any advice? Certifications or courses you would recommend?

This adds a bit of mess in my UX.\n This \"plugin\" keeps track of the status of some git subcommands that require a branch name (switch, checkout, merge, rebase, log are now supported).\n If you mistype the branch name, this tool will try to correct the command.\n For example: You type git switch main, but the main branch does not exist in the current repo – BranchFixer will correct the branch name to master.\n Thus, git switch master will be executed instead of git switch main.\n If it's useful to anyone, use it :)\n https://github.com/sigseg5/BranchFixer/\n P.S.

I have also installed dropbear to remotely unlock the disk after reboot via SSH.\n Sometimes the power goes out and my server will reboot after getting power again but stops booting as the decryption password will be needed.\n I want to automate the process by providing the server with the decryption password over network. First i wrote a script which tries to unlock the system remotely every couple of minutes via cron. This works but is not a very good solution.\n I want a solution where the server pulls the password from another server automatically. \n How would i go about writing an initramfs script which tries to access another server, pull the password from there and unlock itself via that password?\n Or does it make sense to try to alter the dropbear initramfs files so that it pulls the password from another server. https://ubuntu.pkgs.org/22.04/ubuntu-universe-amd64/dropbear-initramfs_2020.81-5_all.deb.html \n I can not use a UPS and i do not want to save the password in plaintext on the machine itself for obvious reasons.\n    submitted by    /u/DiscountCode1212  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I have been a Linux user since the year 2019. I used to run Linux on my all-in-one PC, which had an Intel CPU without any dedicated GPU. The experience there was perfect; I had zero complaints with any of the distributions I tried, but the story changed when I recently bought a gaming laptop with an RTX 3050.\n As expected, the first thing I did was to remove Windows and try to install Fedora on it. At first, the live USB wouldn't even boot because of the missing GPU drivers, so I tried the safe graphics mode, and then, after completing the install, I added the Nvidia drivers. In the beginning, it worked fine, but after some time, performance issues started to occur. Sometimes the OS freezes on the login screen or gives me a blank screen after I enter my password and press enter.\n I was determined that I wanted to use Linux because I like the playing around and freedom that it gives the user, so I tried other distros based on Fedora, RHEL, Ubuntu, and even Arch. I tried different DEs and switched between X11 and Wayland, but everything always gave me some kind of performance dip or left my laptop unresponsive just because of the GPU.\n In the past, when I used Linux on my PC and an old laptop that didn't have a GPU, it always worked fine, but now I am forced to use Windows just because Nvidia has a shitty Linux support.\n At this point I am tired of trying to configure everything by myself and yet getting no results, but I really want to move away from windows so if you guys got any suggestions, I am open to that.\n    submitted by    /u/sexysenpailoves69  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Here's my issue, every time i work on the look of my computers i end up having to propagate changes to a ton of files. Usually while programming you'd want your data that's used in multiple places to be anchored to variables.\n I'm kinda struggling to find a general purpose way of transfering colors, fonts, sizes, across very different applications i.e. terminal, i3config, gtk...\n I'm not a top notch programmer but i'm not an idiot either. I've mulled over the issue for a little while and would like opinions before commiting to what i'd consider to be a sizeable amount of work.\n I'm not comming here empty handed either.\n Take the terminal for instance: gogh has a build process that uses yaml for theme definitions, python for generation/building and bash for installation. It would be pretty easy to use/hijack the build process by simply generating a yaml def.\n For anything that's css-like: a tool like sass or similar is perfect, i'd just have to include my variables. I've seen a couple gtk themes using this.\n Any other configuration that uses text files should be trivial, i'm just uncertain what would be the least painful approach.\n Preprocessing options i've been coming across are: - awk / sed - probably the most painful approach imo - gpp - first time using it but seems to be a good powerful solution - node using gulp or grunt and whatever other rendering tool - i have some experience with this toolset but i feel it's not suited for the task and at this point any programming language that has printf/template strings would give the same result.\n What i'm considering is using make to process sources into a build/staging folder and then letting each 'facet' of themeing run their own build processes if needed.\n So what approach have you been using to tackle this problem?\n    submitted by    /u/Nulltan  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "For years, the tearing protocol has been one of the most controversial features regarding Wayland. Competitive gamers didn't want forced vsync for latency reasons so they kept using Xorg, and many many posts have been made regarding this situation. Only recently it was merged into the Wayland protocol but seemengly no compositor was using it.\n After updating my system about a week ago (notably with the new Nvidia 535 driver), I launched Nier Automata with direct scanout enabled in Hyprland's config file and... surprise! There's no forced vsync and I can notice tearing. I decided to test League of Legends too and it definitely works, I can now uncap my framerate and get it to ~400fps, but if it drops below my monitor's refresh rate (144Hz) tearing is noticeable.\n So... isn't this supposed to be a big thing? Why is no one talking about it?\n ​\n    submitted by    /u/Qweedo420  \n [link]   [comments]",

I set it up so that there is a linux software bridge in NetworkManager/nmtui and then added interface eno1 as a slave device to the bridge nm-bridge.\n The bridge has its own MAC address distinct from the eno1 actual physical ethernet device. That's all fine.\n As I picture this in my head, I picture the nm-bridge device as like a physical layer 2 managed switch and the eno1 ethernet port as a computer connected to one of the ports of that managed switch. Then any VM's I create in virt-manager I also assign to nm-bridge an these are just equivalent to new computers being plugged into the layer 2 man…",

          "description": "克里斯托弗·贝里（章静 绘）\n\n英国格拉斯哥大学政治理论教席荣休教授、荣誉研究员克里斯托弗·贝里（Christopher Berry）是国际著名的苏格兰启蒙运动和亚当·斯密研究专家，现为英国皇家艺术学会会员，苏格兰爱丁堡皇家学会会员，苏格兰学术院院士。他曾出版多部学术著作，其中《苏格兰启蒙运动中的商业社会观念》《苏格兰启蒙运动的社会理论》《奢侈的概念：概念及历史的探究》《大卫·休谟：启蒙与怀疑》等四部已被译为中文。2023年6月，克里斯托弗·贝里应邀参加复旦大学历史系和复旦大学研究生院联合举办的“西方近代思想史”暑期讲习班。正值亚当·斯密诞辰三百周年纪念，我们对贝里教授做了一次专访，由复旦大学历史系李宏图教授协调，复旦大学马克思主义学院副教授、法学博士张晓燕采访。本文为专访的上半部分，贝里教授着重讨论了苏格兰启蒙运动研究的新动向以及对斯密思想的常见误解。\n\n亚当·斯密（1723年6月5日-1790年7月17日)\n\n2023年是亚当·斯密诞辰三百周年，能否向我们介绍一下苏格兰启蒙运动和亚当·斯密研究的最新发展和动向？\n克里斯托弗·贝里：过去二十年，或者是更早的一段时间内，斯密研究有很大的改变，这一变化主要是《亚当·斯密著作与书信汇编（格拉斯哥版）》（The Glasgow Edition of the Works and Correspondence of Adam Smith）这套丛书带来的。自此我们拥有了比较完整的斯密著作，这也是读者第一次看到《法理学讲义》（Lectures on Jurisprudence）和《修辞学与文学讲义》（Lectures on Rhetoric and Belles Lettres）等斯密原著，由此也激发了对斯密研究的热情。一批博士生进一步投入到相关主题的研究中，逐渐形成一股学术热潮。斯密研究最初是围绕《国富论》和《道德情操论》展开的，今天能…",

          "description": "克里斯托弗·贝里（章静 绘）\n\n本文为克里斯托弗·贝里教授专访的下半部分，他介绍了亚当·斯密和苏格兰启蒙运动对现代社会的影响，以及他所做的有关“奢侈”概念的经典研究。\n从方法论的角度，苏格兰启蒙对现代社会科学有什么样的启示？您多次提到苏格兰启蒙受到关注的原因之一就是哈耶克将对自生自发的秩序（spontan eous order）和建构秩序（artificial order）的区分传统归因到苏格兰启蒙。前者关注社会与文化的历史演化，这种方法论被认为源自于苏格兰启蒙，苏格兰启蒙中对习俗而非理性的强调是否可以认为是受自然科学影响的产物？苏格兰启蒙在如何处理好规范与经验、普遍性与多样性的关系问题上，为社会科学方法论提供了什么样的启发？\n克里斯托弗·贝里：哈耶克因为所秉持的经济理论以及他对凯恩斯经济理论的反对而闻名，他所属的奥地利经济学派所持的观点在十九世纪末属于比较边缘的学术观点。奥地利学派的观点在一定程度上是斯密主义的体现，但是对斯密围绕对个人利益和公共善的追求的观点做了非常狭窄的解读。奥地利学派认为，与其他人相比，每个人是自我利益的最佳判断者，个体之间相互合作，在此基础上产生需求，产业机构试图满足这种需求，这就是价格机制的运行过程。用哈耶克的话来说，价格就是一个信号，从需求状况中传递生产信息。这是一种对奥地利经济学派的观点毫无修饰的陈述，哈耶克则多次使用了一个弗格森所运用的表达来描述这一观点，这个表达就是自生自发的秩序。自生自发的秩序是一个很古老的观念，指代的是这样一个没有任何直接的人为因素或者说官僚力量的影响，事物自有其发展方式的秩序模式，自生自发的秩序也意味着客观上也没有人可以控制这个发展的过程。很多持哈耶克观点的人对此是毫无保留的，都认为这种自生自发的秩序是最佳的，因为是由个体来决定自己的兴趣和利益是什么。我总是通过一件轶事来跟学生阐述这一理论。我曾经到美国进行过两次讲学…",

          "description": "小说家霍桑（1804-1864）是美国“黑暗浪漫主义”的代表人物，以《红字》《七角楼房》《福谷传奇》和《玉石雕像》等四大罗曼司闻名于世。此外，霍桑在短篇小说创作方面也卓有建树，有短篇“圣手”之美誉。他的短篇佳构多收录于《故事重述》（1837）、《古屋青苔》（1846）和《雪影》（1852）等三部故事集中，其中若干题材涉及巫术、变形以及万灵药水等超自然现象，无疑是对社会现实的扭曲反映。这类故事的主人公大多生性善良，不乏艺术天赋，但由于身处恶劣环境之中，往往难以逃脱悲剧性结局。同时代的小说家梅尔维尔曾评价霍桑隐居“古屋”（Old Manse）期间创作的短篇小说“笼罩在黑暗之中，因而分外黑暗”，并指明作家的本意并非神异其事，而是影射现实——从这个角度看，此类短篇皆可归为“寓言”。\n《雪影》（The Snow-Image）取材于新英格兰普通家庭生活：家中两个孩子与雪花形成的雪孩一道在户外快乐玩耍，宽厚仁慈的父亲担心雪孩受冻，坚持将其带回家中炉前烘烤，雪孩立时化为一滩水渍。这是霍桑笔下最浅显的儿童寓言：作家一方面以清丽的笔触描绘自然景物，一方面讴歌人性之纯洁善良。然而，故事的结局却点明本文寓意所在：美国社会（及民众）最为推崇的务实精神与心灵世界格格不入——从一定意义上甚至可以说前者是后者的天敌。由于缺乏艺术的想象力和感知力，他们往往在无意之中扼杀美和艺术。\n《海德格尔医生的实验》（Dr. Heidegger’s Experiment）同样是一则寓言。故事中的医生邀请五位老友，前来品尝他最新的科学发明——一种能让人返老还童的青春泉水。在场的所有人都信誓旦旦，保证重获青春后将开始崭新的生活。可当他们喝下泉水、如愿重回青春岁月后，立刻又恢复了旧时的恶习本性。最后，众人在一番抢夺中失手打碎水壶，于是一场美梦宣告破碎。这一故事体现了霍桑短篇一贯的主题，即“人性恶”无处不在：它可能在某些特定条件…",

          "description": "林峥（章静绘）\n\n公园是十九世纪中期西方为因应工业革命带来的城市问题而创造的产物，它是现代都市之心，是城市规划中始终挥之不去的乌托邦理想。在中国，“公园”一词古已有之，指称的却是官家园林，与西方public park的概念完全不同。中山大学中文系副教授林峥的《公园北京》考察公园作为一个新兴的西方文明装置如何进入近代北京的过程。以公园为视角，该书呈现了晚清至民国北京政治、社会、历史、文化、文学诸方面纷繁复杂的变革。近日，《上海书评》专访了林峥，请她谈谈与近代北京公园互为表里的文化生产与文学想象。\n\n《公园北京：文化生产与文学想象（1860-1937）》，林峥著，北京大学出版社，2022年10月出版，408页，79.00元\n\n您认为公园作为西方文明装置，进入近代北京，体现了另一种现代性。您对这种现代性的解释是以旧纳新、以新化旧，它表现为最旧的帝国遗迹同时也是最新的公共场域，表现为在外观古色古香的建筑内部引入现代设施。为什么这是“另一种”现代性？\n林峥：现代性的概念源自西方，与都市相伴相生，纷繁复杂，中国对于现代性的理解，主要体现为晚清五四以来一种以西方（启蒙现代性）为模板的、线性进步的发展观。这样建立在西方启蒙传统加诸被曲解的社会达尔文主义之上的对于现代性的理解，容易造成一味趋新、趋西的心态。同时我认为，中国在现代化、都市化的过程中有自身独特的发展脉络，若以西方的现代性理论轨范中国城市，很难完全解释与涵盖中国的经验，这也是我为何选择“公园北京”作为研究对象的原因。\n一方面，公园是西方现代都市文明的象征，清末民初的政府、启蒙知识分子也是从这个思路出发，将公园引进中国；但另一方面，近代北京的公园又不是另起炉灶、照搬西式，而是在前朝皇家园林坛庙的基础上改造开放，这造就了近代北京公园的特殊性。它的风景情致是中式的，内在精神又是现代的，既是最旧的帝国遗迹，也是最新的公共场域。可与之相对比…",

          "description": "FSF 指谷歌在 WEI 上的做法是“邪恶先锋”\n\r\n自由软件基金会（FSF）的 Greg Farough 批评谷歌提出的网络环境完整性（WEI）是对自由互联网的全面攻击。称该政策文件所强调的使用案例与其真正的使用案例相比，简直是小巫见大巫，因为其真正的使用案例是制定一种方法来完全彻底地限制互联网的自由。借助 WEI，政府将可以利用它来确保只有其官方 “批准”（读作：后门）的浏览器才能访问互联网；Netflix 等公司将利用它来推进数字限制管理（DRM）；谷歌将利用它来拒绝用户访问其服务，除非用户使用的浏览器符合其利润率。最初 WEI 还只是发布在 GitHub 上的一份无伤大雅的 政策文件，但谷歌现在已将其快速发展到 Chromium 浏览器中，WEI 将很快就会出现在我们面前。他说，“曾经有段时间谷歌的理念是‘不作恶’，它如此短时间内就在 WEI 上取得进展，我们可以非常肯定地说，他们现在的政策是要成为邪恶先锋。”\n\r\n\r\n消息来源：FSF\n\r\n\r\n\r\n老王点评：很多人没太理解 WEI 的危害，而这篇文章清晰的分析了其潜在的危害。但是，这种程度的社区抗议恐怕无济于事。谷歌比较忌惮的是其它企业和政府对它的反对。除了支持 Firefox 这类自由的浏览器之外，我们还可以寄希望于在其它的 Chromium 下游版本中去除 WEI。\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\nAlmaLinux 向红帽示好，被拒绝了\n\r\n红帽关闭 CentOS，推行 CentOS Stream 成为 RHEL 上游，其中一个理由是希望社区来参与 CentOS Stream/RHEL 的开发，并指责 AlmaLinux 等 RHEL 克隆品只是简单的重建，而没有做出任何贡献。而 AlamLinux 一方面表示将不再寻求 1:1 克隆，将在 RHEL 之外合并补丁，另外一方面“也尝试在 CentOS Stream 中测试和复制问题”，以示好红帽。最近，AlmaLinux 提交了一个 Iperf3 的 CVE 修复到 CentOS Stream。但红帽公司的一位高级软件工程师回复说：“感谢您的贡献。目前，我们不打算在 RHEL 中解决这个问题，不过我们会根据客户需求继续评估。”AlamLinux 不理解“只需合并即可，为什么还要拒绝修复呢？”之前曾经称 AlmaLinux 等“只是简单地重建代码”的红帽公司核心平台（又名 RHEL）副总裁 Mike McGrath 对 AlmaLinux 表示了感谢，但拒绝了这些代码。事后，McGrath 承认错失了对 AlmaLinux 表达善意的机会，并提升了该 CVE 的等级，合并了这些代码。\n\r\n\r\n消息来源：ZDNet\n\r\n\r\n\r\n老王点评：只是说说而已，谁让你真提交代码了，没事就给添乱，你知道你提交了代码，红帽要做作多少回归测试吗。\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\nPython 接受可选全局解释器锁提案\n\r\nPython 指导委员会宣布，它计划接受 PEP 703，让全局解释器锁成为可选，即 No-GIL 模式。预计将在 Python 3.13 初步支持该模式。CPython 的全局解释器锁（GIL）阻止了同时多线程执行代码，成为了在多核 CPU 上提高 Python 代码运行效率的一大障碍。Meta 公司承诺为 PEP 703 提案提供 人力支持。Python 指导委员会强调了兼容性的重要性，要避免出现类似 Python 3 的情况，称它不是 Python 4。\n\r\n\r\n消息来源：Python 基金会\n\r\n\r\n\r\n老王点评：不是 Python 4，胜似 Python 4，这一改进对将 Python 应用到重要领域很有意义。",

          "description": "在大多数编程语言中，你都会找到字符串数据类型。字符串基本上是一组字符。\n\r\n但 Bash Shell 有所不同。字符串没有单独的数据类型。这里一切都是变量。\n\r\n但这并不意味着你不能像在 C 和其他编程语言中那样处理字符串。\n\r\n在 Bash Shell 中可以查找子字符串、替换子字符串、连接字符串以及更多字符串操作。\n\r\n在 Bash 基础知识系列的这一部分中，你将学习基本的字符串操作。\n\r\n在 Bash 中获取字符串长度\n\r\n让我们从最简单的选项开始。也就是获取字符串的长度。这很简单：\n\r\n${#string}\r\n\n\r\n让我们在示例中使用它。\n\r\n\n\r\n正如你所看到的，第二个示例中有两个单词，但由于它用引号引起来，因此它被视为单个单词。连空格都算作一个字符。\n\r\n在 Bash 中连接字符串\n\r\n用技术术语来说是字符串 连接concatenation，这是 Bash 中最简单的字符串操作之一。\n\r\n你只需像这样一个接一个地使用字符串变量：\n\r\nstr3=$str1$str2\r\n\n\r\n还能比这更简单吗？我觉得不能。\n\r\n让我们看一个例子。这是我的示例脚本，名为 join.sh：\n\r\n#!/bin/bash\r\n\r\nread -p \"Enter first string: \" str1\r\nread -p \"Enter second string: \" str2\r\n\r\njoined=$str1$str2\r\n\r\necho \"The joined string is: $joined\"\r\n\n\r\n以下是该脚本的运行示例：\n\r\n\n\r\n在 Bash 中提取子字符串\n\r\n假设你有一个包含多个字符的大字符串，并且你想要提取其中的一部分。\n\r\n要提取子字符串，需要指定主字符串、子字符串的起始位置和子字符串的长度，如下所示：\n\r\n${string:$pos:$len}\r\n\n\r\n\r\n💡 和数组一样，字符串中的定位也是从 0 开始。\n\r\n\r\n这是一个例子：\n\r\n\n\r\n即使你指定的子字符串长度大于字符串长度，它也只会到达字符串末尾。\n\r\n替换 Bash 中的子字符串\n\r\n假设你有一个大字符串，并且你想用另一个字符串替换其中的一部分。\n\r\n在这种情况下，你可以使用这种语法：\n\r\n${string/substr1/substr2}\r\n\n\r\n\r\n✋ 只有第一次出现的子字符串才会以这种方式替换。如果要替换所有出现的地方，请使用 ${string//substr1/substr2}\n\r\n\r\n这是一个例子：\n\r\n\n\r\n正如你在上面看到的，“good” 一词被替换为 “best”。我将替换的字符串保存到同一字符串中以更改原始字符串。\n\r\n\r\n💡 如果未找到子字符串，则不会替换任何内容。它不会导致错误。\n\r\n\r\n在 Bash 中删除子字符串\n\r\n我们来谈谈删除子字符串。假设你要删除字符串的一部分。在这种情况下，只需将子字符串提供给主字符串，如下所示：\n\r\n${string/substring}\r\n\n\r\n\r\n✋ 通过这种方式，仅删除第一次出现的子字符串。如果要删除所有出现的内容，请使用 ${string//substr}\n\r\n\r\n如果找到子字符串，则将从字符串中删除它。\n\r\n让我们通过一个例子来看看。\n\r\n\n\r\n不用说，如果没有找到子字符串，则不会删除它。它不会导致错误。\n\r\n🏋️ 练习时间\n\r\n现在是你通过简单练习来实践字符串操作的时候了。\n\r\n练习 1：声明一个字符串 “I am all wet”。现在通过用 “set” 替换单词 “wet” 来更改此字符串。\n\r\n练习 2：创建一个字符串，以 112-123-1234 格式保存电话号码。现在，你必须删除所有 -。\n\r\n这应该会给你一些在 Bash 中使用字符串的不错的练习。在下一章中，你将学习如何在 Bash 中使用 if-else 语句。敬请关注。\n\r\n（题图：MJ/aa73b2c9-6d2f-42e2-972d-94fab56d30cc）\n\r\n\r\nvia: https://itsfoss.com/bash-strings/\n\r\n作者：Abhishek Prakash 选题：lkxed 译者：geekpi 校对：wxy\n\r\n本文由 LCTT 原创编译，Linux中国 荣誉推出",

          "description": "IMAX 电影播放仍然需要一台 21 年前的掌上电脑\n\r\n在《奥本海默》上映之前，IMAX TikTok 官方账号发布的一段视频中，有一个小小的蓝银色 Palm 设备。它是在另一台设备上运行的 Palm Pilot 模拟器，安装在放置卷轴的机器旁边的白色柱子上。这个仿真的设备是 Palm m130，于 2002 年发布。它有一个两英寸的 160x160 显示屏，采用 33MHz 的摩托罗拉处理器，运行 Palm OS 4.1 系统。在 IMAX 影院中，该掌上电脑的工作是控制快转卷轴装置，多年来，在大多数 IMAX 影院里，似乎都有一个实体 m130。IMAX 为什么还要在 21 年前的设备上运行其系统？又为什么会选择在一台蹩脚的 Windows 平板电脑上简单地模拟这台 21 年前的设备呢？因为，放映员们已经习惯了它的存在。\n\r\n\r\n消息来源：The Verge\n\r\n\r\n\r\n老王点评：2000 年时，我用过早期 Palm，却没想到在二十几年后 Palm 仍然在用。\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n特斯拉开始生产可以媲美超算榜首的 Dojo 超级计算机\n\r\n特斯拉在 2023 年第二季度财报中概述了大规模解决车辆自动驾驶问题所需的四大技术支柱：超大型真实世界数据集、神经网络训练、车辆硬件和车辆软件。特斯拉表示，它已经开始生产用于训练其自动驾驶车队的 Dojo 超级计算机，该计算机宣布于 2019 年。特斯拉已经拥有一台基于英伟达 GPU 的大型超级计算机，它是世界上最强大的超级计算机之一，但新的 Dojo 定制计算机使用的是特斯拉设计的芯片。此前，马斯克曾宣称，Dojo 的运算能力将达到 1 ExaFLOP。目前，据公开披露的信息，美国橡树岭国家实验室的超级计算机 Frontier 是全球首台达到 ExaFLOP 级别的计算机，也是唯一一台。\n\r\n\r\n消息来源：The Verge\n\r\n\r\n\r\n老王点评：虽然可能还需要一年时间，但是特斯拉能从芯片到贴片、托盘、机架，乃至于构成一个集群，其计算实力不容小觑。\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\nAMI 固件中发现影响数百万计算机的严重漏洞\n\r\n这些漏洞是在 AMI 为 BMC（底板管理控制器）制作的固件中发现的，BMC 是集成在服务器主板上的小型计算机，可以远程管理多台计算机。可以访问 Redfish 远程管理接口的本地或远程攻击者可以利用这些漏洞，导致未经授权的访问、远程代码执行和服务器的潜在物理损坏。这一漏洞使其能够在世界上一些最敏感的云环境中获得超级用户身份。在那里，攻击者可以安装勒索软件和间谍恶意软件，在受感染机器的最底层运行。成功的攻击者还可能对服务器造成物理损坏或无限期重启循环。\n\r\n\r\n消息来源：Ars Technica\n\r\n\r\n\r\n老王点评：在支持远程管理的固件上出现的安全漏洞，那才叫一个防不胜防。",

          "description": "现存最古老的发行版 Slackware 已经 30 岁了\n\r\n本周，Slackware Linux 项目庆祝其成立 30 周年。Slackware 1.0 版本于 1993 年 7 月 16 日发布，它是目前仍在积极维护和开发的最古老的 Linux 发行版，虽然它不是第一个 Linux 发行版。最让人敬佩的是，其创始人至今仍在维护该项目。他说，“这真的是一段非凡的旅程，我在 1993 年开始时根本无法预料。”当前版本 Slackware 15 于 2021 年进入测试阶段，并于去年初发布。顺便说一句，MCC Interim Linux 可以说是第一个发行版，它的第一个候选版本 0.97 在 1991 年内核发布几个月后就出现了。Debian 比 Slackware 稍微年轻一点，是在 Slackware 发布两个月后发布的。\n\r\n\r\n消息来源：The Register\n\r\n\r\n\r\n老王点评：Slackware 是我用过的第一个 Linux 发行版，那应该是 1997 年或 1998 年。而我那时最喜欢的发行版是 Mandrake。\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n黑客之王凯文·米特尼克去世\n\r\n凯文·米特尼克Kevin Mitnick，曾被称为 “世界头号通缉黑客”，于上周日去世，享年 59 岁。他曾因侵入和篡改公司计算机网络而入狱服刑，2000 年获释后开始了新的职业生涯，担任安全顾问、作家和公共演讲人。他最为人熟知的是 20 世纪 90 年代的疯狂犯罪，当时他从美国各地的电脑中窃取了成千上万的数据文件和信用卡号码。他利用自己的技能进入美国的电话和手机网络，破坏政府、企业和大学的计算机系统。1995 年，经过长达两年多的追捕，他被美国联邦调查局抓获。\n\r\n\r\n消息来源：Engadget\n\r\n\r\n\r\n老王点评：这是一个传奇，虽然是那种以破坏为目的的“黑客”，但依然是传奇的一生。\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n苹果正在开发自己的人工智能大模型\n\r\n据报道，苹果正在开发自己的大语言模型以及类似 ChatGPT 的 AI 工具。苹果的大模型代号 “Ajax”，苹果还创建了一个聊天机器人服务，一些工程师称之为 “Apple GPT”。苹果有多个团队在 AI 项目上展开合作，它已成为苹果的一大重要工作。苹果员工表示这项工作基本上是对 Bard、ChatGPT 的复制，并不包含任何新功能或新技术。苹果正在积极改进模型，但目前没有向消费者发布的计划。\n\r\n\r\n消息来源：彭博社\n\r\n\r\n\r\n老王点评：苹果在这一点上已经大大落后，不知道什么时候它的 Siri 才可以变聪明。",

          "description": "本章将介绍如何在 Bash Shell 脚本中使用数组。学习添加元素、删除元素和获取数组长度。\n\r\n\r\n在本系列的前面部分中，你了解了变量。变量中可以有单个值。\n\r\n数组内部可以有多个值。当你必须一次处理多个变量时，这会使事情变得更容易。你不必将各个值存储在新变量中。\n\r\n因此，不要像这样声明五个变量：\n\r\ndistro1=Ubuntu\r\ndistro2=Fedora\r\ndistro3=SUSE\r\ndistro4=Arch Linux\r\ndistro5=Nix\r\n\n\r\n你可以在单个数组中初始化它们所有：\n\r\ndistros=(Ubuntu Fedora SUSE \"Arch Linux\" Nix)\r\n\n\r\n与其他一些编程语言不同，你不使用逗号作为数组元素分隔符。\n\r\n那挺好的。让我们看看如何访问数组元素。\n\r\n在 Bash 中访问数组元素\n\r\n使用索引（数组中的位置）访问数组元素。要访问索引 N 处的数组元素，请使用：\n\r\n${array_name[N]}\r\n\n\r\n\r\n💡 与大多数其他编程语言一样，Bash Shell 中的数组从索引 0 开始。这意味着第一个元素的索引为 0，第二个元素的索引为 1，第 n 个元素的索引为 n-1。\n\r\n\r\n因此，如果你想打印 SUSE，你将使用：\n\r\necho ${distros[2]}\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n🚧 ${ 之后或 } 之前不能有任何空格。你不能像 ${ array[n] } 那样使用它。\n\r\n\r\n一次访问所有数组元素\n\r\n假设你要打印数组的所有元素。\n\r\n你可以一一使用 echo ${array[n]} 但这确实没有必要。有一个更好更简单的方法：\n\r\n${array[*]}\r\n\n\r\n这将为你提供所有数组元素。\n\r\n\n\r\n在 Bash 中获取数组长度\n\r\n如何知道数组中有多少个元素？ 有一个专门的方法 在 Bash 中获取数组长度：\n\r\n${#array_name[@]}\r\n\n\r\n就这么简单，对吧？\n\r\n\n\r\n在 Bash 中添加数组元素\n\r\n如果必须向数组添加其他元素，请使用 += 运算符 将元素追加到 Bash 中的现有数组：\n\r\narray_name+=(\"new_value\")\r\n\n\r\n这是一个例子：\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n🚧 追加元素时使用 () 很重要。\n\r\n\r\n你还可以使用索引将元素设置在任何位置。\n\r\narray_name[N]=new_value\r\n\n\r\n但请记住使用正确的索引编号。 如果在现有索引上使用它，新值将替换该元素。\n\r\n如果你使用“越界”索引，它仍会添加到最后一个元素之后。例如，如果数组长度为 6，并且你尝试在索引 9 处设置新值，则该值仍将作为最后一个元素添加到第 7 个位置（索引 6）。\n\r\n\n\r\n删除数组元素\n\r\n你可以使用 Shell 内置的 unset 通过提供索引号来删除数组元素：\n\r\nunset array_name[N]\r\n\n\r\n这是一个示例，我删除了数组的第四个元素。\n\r\n\n\r\n你还可以通过 unset 来删除整个数组：\n\r\nunset array_name\r\n\n\r\n\r\n💡 Bash 中没有严格的数据类型规则。你可以创建一个同时包含整数和字符串的数组。\n\r\n\r\n🏋️ 练习时间\n\r\n让我们练习一下你所学到的有关 Bash 数组的知识。\n\r\n练习 1：创建一个 Bash 脚本，其中包含五个最佳 Linux 发行版的数组。全部打印出来。\n\r\n现在，用 “Hannah Montanna Linux” 替换中间的选择。\n\r\n练习 2：创建一个 Bash 脚本，该脚本接受用户提供的三个数字，然后以相反的顺序打印它们。\n\r\n预期输出：\n\r\nEnter three numbers and press enter\r\n12 23 44\r\nNumbers in reverse order are: 44 23 12\r\n\n\r\n我希望你喜欢通过本系列学习 Bash Shell 脚本。在下一章中，你将学习如何使用 if-else。敬请关注。\n\r\n（题图：MJ/09477e2f-2bf9-4fdf-bc1e-c894a068adf2）\n\r\n\r\nvia: https://itsfoss.com/bash-arrays/\n\r\n作者：Abhishek Prakash 选题：lkxed 译者：geekpi 校对：wxy\n\r\n本文由 LCTT 原创编译，Linux中国 荣誉推出",

          "description": "Meta 发布新大语言模型，可免费商用，采用特别的“开源”方式\n\r\nMeta 周二发布了 Llama 2：这是一套经过预训练和微调的基于文本的人工智能模型，有三种不同的规模，分别包含 70 亿、130 亿和 700 亿个参数。与之前的 LLaMA 模型不同的是，任何人都可以申请下载 Llama 2，开发人员可以用它来构建商业产品或服务，以及开展有趣的项目。Meta 表示，不会对访问或使用其开发的模型收费，而是通过向其他公司开放该技术，如与微软和亚马逊合作，在 Azure 和 AWS 上提供该模型。值得注意的是，Llama 2 采用了专门的 许可证，有一些独特的限制，因此不符合“开源”的定义。除了常见的免责声明外，开发人员不能利用其输出结果来改进其他类型的大型语言模型。以及，如果将 Llama 2 用于支持那些拥有超过 7 亿月活跃用户的应用程序的大公司，必须申请使用 Meta 技术的特殊许可。\n\r\n\r\n消息来源：The Register\n\r\n\r\n\r\n老王点评：虽然不是规范定义的“开源”软件，但至少是开放的。值得注意但是，从 LLaMA 到 Llama 2，Meta 都采用了非同寻常的“开源”方式，这或许是 Meta 既想利用开源的优势，又有一些不确定的担忧。也许人工智能领域需要一种独特的开放许可证。\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n美国启动物联网安全标签计划\n\r\n该计划的正式名称为《美国网络信任标识》，旨在帮助美国人确保他们购买的互联网连接设备具有强大的网络安全保护措施，可防范网络攻击。长期以来，物联网一直被认为是网络安全的薄弱环节。符合该标准的设备将要求具有唯一且强大的默认密码、保护存储和传输的数据、提供定期的安全更新以及具备事故检测能力等。\n\r\n\r\n消息来源：Tech Crunch\n\r\n\r\n\r\n老王点评：越来越多的物联网设备，其实是埋在信息社会底层的空洞，你不知道它什么时候就会导致塌陷。\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n印度大部分外包程序员将在两年内因人工智能而消失\n\r\nStability AI 公司的 CEO 表示，印度的大多数外包程序员将在未来一两年内失业。不过他认为，在法国等受《劳动法》保护较强的国家受到这种影响的可能性较小。他重申了他之前的说法，五年后将 “不再有程序员”，不过，他也说明，他指的是传统意义上的程序员。他说，“当你把编程这件事从错误测试、单元测试到构思进行解构时，人工智能可以做到这一点，而且做得更好。但这不是自动完成的，而是人工智能‘辅助驾驶’完成的。”\n\r\n\r\n消息来源：CNBC\n\r\n\r\n\r\n老王点评：其实也不用特别慌，就像计算器、计算机出现，并没有让原来的财务和文员失业一样，只是如果你掌握不了新工具，那这种“古典程序员”被淘汰也是自然的。",

          "description": "当你开始在桌面上使用 Linux 时，你可能会选择像 Ubuntu 或者 Linux Mint 这样的 对初学者友好的发行版。\n\r\n随着你逐渐熟悉 Linux 并且开始喜欢上它，你会加入各种社交渠道上的 Linux 相关社区，关注分享 Linux 内容的网站。而当你这样做的时候，你也会发现一些新的、相对不知名的发行版。\n\r\n因为你对这个领域还比较陌生，你可能会被诱惑尝试一个接一个的发行版，从而陷入“发行版快闪”的陷阱。\n\r\n\n\r\n于是你开始问自己这个问题：“我应该使用一个未知的发行版，还是像大多数人那样使用流行的发行版呢”？\n\r\n简单的答案是坚持使用主流的发行版，但真正的答案需要你自己思考。\n\r\n使用新的、较为冷门的发行版存在的问题\n\r\n使用“全新的、个人开发者的发行版”存在一个主要问题，那就是不确定性。你无法确定这个项目将会存在多久。可能是一年，也可能是一个月。\n\r\n我曾经见过几个发行版出现这种情况。比如，SemiCode OS 由于为程序员而创建而变得流行。类似的发行版 Emperor OS 最近消失了。这只是被停止开发的发行版长列表中的几个例子。\n\r\n你可能会说，一个有一定用户基础的旧发行版也可能出现同样的情况。这是对的，但通常情况下，有一个社区和多个开发者参与项目。这样你就有一定的保证。\n\r\n由于开发者的经验不足，新的发行版可能会缺失关键功能。例如，在撰写本文时，看起来令人惊艳的 Garuda Linux 官方并不推荐双启动。\n\r\n\n\r\n尽管 Garuda Linux 拥有相当数量的支持者和几名开发者参与项目，但仍存在这个问题。\n\r\n大多数新的发行版没有提供实质性的内容\n\r\n你经常会遇到一些全新的发行版，它们基于一些其他流行的发行版，比如 Ubuntu 或 Arch Linux。唯一的不同可能只在于默认的应用程序、主题和壁纸。\n\r\n如果它是一个“面向程序员的发行版”，它可能会默认安装一些编程应用程序。如果它是一个“游戏发行版”，它可能会默认安装一些工具，如 Steam、Wine 和 Lutris。你不太可能在图形或硬件方面看到真正的优化。\n\r\n这就是为什么很多人说，已经有了数百个发行版的拥挤空间中，我们不需要更多的发行版。毕竟，在主流发行版中安装所需的应用程序并不难。\n\r\n我反对这些新的发行版吗？\n\r\n绝对不是。\n\r\n你可能会觉得几乎没有提供任何价值的新发行版是多余的。你可能是对的，因为这些项目可能对你来说无关紧要，但对于开发它的人来说，它们是重要的。\n\r\n你有没有试过学习一门编程语言？第一个教程通常是一个“Hello World”的程序。即便是高级程序员也是从“Hello World”开始的。\n\r\n婴儿不会直接开始跑步。到达那个阶段需要时间。\n\r\n我对这些项目的看法也是一样的。如果有人热爱 Linux 并且对创建自己的“操作系统”感到兴奋，就让他们去做吧。如果你不想鼓励他们，也不要泼冷水。\n\r\n大多数项目都是从相同的方式开始的。Linux Mint 是一款非常受欢迎的 Linux 发行版。它于 2006 年开始，并以 Kubuntu 为基础。\n\r\n真的需要“一个基于 Ubuntu 的类似发行版”吗？实际上并不需要。但看看 Linux Mint 如今的地位。\n\r\n那么，你应该使用新的发行版还是不应该使用呢？\n\r\n总体而言，这取决于你自己。\n\r\n如果你不喜欢频繁格式化你的系统，并且希望继续正常生活，那就坚持使用主流的发行版。\n\r\n如果你喜欢实验，不介意频繁更换操作系统并且愿意冒着搞乱系统的风险，那么你可以尝试新的发行版。就个人而言，我建议你在虚拟机中尝试它们。如果你能有一台空闲的系统专门用于实验，那就更好了。\n\r\n你也可以使用那些在社区中存在多年，但不如 Ubuntu、Mint、Fedora 和 Debian 等发行版流行的发行版。像 PCLinuxOS、Puppy Linux、Peppermint OS 等项目拥有一个较小但活跃的社区。它们绝对是一个可靠的选择，即使用于你的主系统也没有问题。\n\r\n在选择发行版时，除了基础发行版外，你还应该看看该发行版是否经常更新，并拥有一个活跃的社区。你只需要查看该项目的论坛，看看社区中是否有足够的活动即可。\n\r\n你更喜欢哪种类型的发行版？\n\r\n这是我在选择新的较为冷门发行版和流行的主流发行版之间提出的想法和建议。\n\r\n那你呢？你更喜欢哪种类型的发行版？\n\r\n（题图：MJ/930988c0-443d-4d61-a603-1466a5e33d85）\n\r\n\r\nvia: https://news.itsfoss.com/obscure-or-maintsream-distro/\n\r\n作者：Abhishek 选题：lujun9972 译者：ChatGPT 校对：wxy\n\r\n本文由 LCTT 原创编译，Linux中国 荣誉推出",

          "description": "华为有望克服美国禁令重返 5G 手机市场\n\r\n三家覆盖中国智能手机行业的第三方技术研究公司告诉路透社，华为应该能够利用自身在半导体设计工具方面的进步，以及中芯国际的芯片制造，在中国国内采购 5G 芯片。关于半导体设计工具，我们几个月前在 #951 报道过，华为称已开发出自己的 14 纳米芯片设计套件。华为曾一度与苹果和三星争夺全球最大手机制造商的地位，直到 2019 年开始的一轮美国限制措施，切断了其获得生产最先进机型所必需的芯片制造工具的渠道。\n\r\n\r\n消息来源：路透社\n\r\n\r\n\r\n老王点评：终于见到光明了，终究还是得自给自足才行。\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n谷歌应用商店将允许在应用和游戏中使用 NFT\n\r\n谷歌今天宣布了一项重大的政策调整，允许开发者将 NFT 等数字资产纳入其商店中的应用和游戏。谷歌称，这将允许合作伙伴重新想象 “用户拥有内容的传统游戏”，并 “通过独特的 NFT 奖励提高用户忠诚度”。决定提供购买、出售或赚取代币化资产能力的公司将被要求明确说明应用程序中存在基于区块链的元素。\n\r\n\r\n消息来源：Coindesk\n\r\n\r\n\r\n老王点评：似乎 NFT 热潮已经过去一段时间了，连元宇宙都没什么人提了。偏偏在这个时候，谷歌打开了大门。不太理解背后发生了什么。\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n迪士尼和 Netflix 等反对 FTC 简化取消订阅流程的提议\n\r\n如今各种服务都在努力吸引用户订阅，但如果你想终止某个服务的订阅就不是那么容易了。美国联邦贸易委员会（FTC）宣布了被称为 “点击取消” 的提议，要求企业让取消服务和订阅一样简单。企业不能够让用户在网上订阅服务，但取消的操作却要通过电话来完成。也不能对于服务设定不取消就默认续订，而是企业需要每年提醒用户。包括迪士尼、派拉蒙、华纳兄弟、Netflix、索尼、环球影业等公司在内的行业组织对 FTC 的提议提出反对意见，认为拟议的法规过于模糊，会导致营销人员过度披露信息。它们甚至认为该提议会违反美国宪法第一修正案，侵犯其成员的“言论自由权”。\n\r\n\r\n消息来源：Business Insider\n\r\n\r\n\r\n老王点评：这种上船容易下船难的做法，早就该管管了。为啥我就一直不喜欢订阅服务——虽然我最近增加了不少订阅服务，我甚至觉得有必要用个应用来专门管理订阅服务。",

          "description": "Solus 4.4 有了一些令人印象深刻的升级，不久以后将推出一款新版本。\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\nSolus 是一个许久没有出现在新闻中的名字，我们上一次听说它是今年 4 月份它经历了 又一次动荡。\n\r\n幸运的是，新的组织重组似乎奏效了，因为现在我们在近两年后迎来了新发布！\n\r\nSolus 是最棒的 独立 Linux 发行版 之一，提供了非常适合初学者的用户体验。\n\r\n和它的上一个版本 Solus 4.3 相比，它带来了许多改进，这个新版本的目标是超越之前的版本。\n\r\n让我们看看 Solus 最新版本有什么新特性。\n\r\n🆕 Solus 4.4: 有什么新内容？\n\r\n\n\r\nSolus 4.4 带来了许多改进，其中一些最显著的包括以下内容：\n\r\n\r\n更好的硬件支持\n\r\n桌面环境升级\n\r\n更新的应用程序套件\n\r\n\r\n更好的硬件支持\n\r\n前所未有的，Solus 4.4 使用 Linux 内核 6.3.8 作为强大的基础来支持各种硬件。硬件支持包括：\n\r\n\r\n安全启动\n\r\n英特尔 Arc 显卡\n\r\n英伟达 40 系列显卡\n\r\nAMD Radeon RX 7600、7900 XT 和 7900 XTX 显卡\n\r\n增强对各种光传感器和加速度计的支持\n\r\n以及更多\n\r\n\r\n桌面环境升级\n\r\n这是你将找到 Solus 中最关键的错误修复和提升用户体验的改进之处。由于提供了四个不同的版本，我们将介绍每个版本中的新功能。\n\r\nGNOME 43.5\n\r\n\n\r\nSolus 4.4 采用了最新的 GNOME 43.5 版本，带来了许多调整。默认的窗口主题切换到了 Adwaita，且默认启用了深色模式。\n\r\n此外，更新了系统用户界面的样式，重新设计了系统状态菜单，方便快速更改常用设置。\n\r\nMATE 将被 XFCE 取代\n\r\n\n\r\n而对于 MATE 版本，Solus 4.4 采用了最新的 MATE 1.27.1 版本。它包括各种可靠性和可访问性的修复，更改了键盘驱动程序，以及将 qxl 视频驱动程序设为处理虚拟化视频驱动程序支持的默认驱动程序。\n\r\n遗憾的是，Solus 开发团队决定在未来的版本中 淘汰 MATE 版本，并采用 XFCE 版本。这其中的关键原因是 MATE 项目处于非常 衰败的状态，并且 没有计划支持 Wayland。\n\r\nBudgie 10.7.2\n\r\n\n\r\n对于 Budgie 版本，Solus 4.4 采用了 Budgie 10.7.2 版本，使 Solus 能够利用新的应用索引器、重新设计的设置菜单、可访问性改进等功能。\n\r\n此外，Solus 现在默认使用 Nemo 文件管理器，不再使用 Nautilus。原因是 Nautilus 被更改为 GTK4 和 libadwaita，不再符合系统其他部分的外观和感觉。\n\r\nKDE Plasma\n\r\n\n\r\n同样，在 Plasma 版本中，Solus 4.4 采用了最新的 Plasma 5.27.5 版本，以及 KDE Frameworks 5.106.0、KDE Gear 23.04.2 和 KDE 分支的 QT 5.15.9。\n\r\n这带来了许多新功能；其中一些亮点包括：\n\r\n\r\n默认应用启动器被 Kickoff 替换\n\r\nWayland 会话默认提供\n\r\nKSysGuard 被 System Monitor 替换\n\r\n新的“总览视图”，可用于管理所有活动的桌面/应用程序\n\r\n支持大屏幕模式\n\r\n\r\n更新的应用套件\n\r\n除了上述更改之外，Solus 4.4 还包括更新的应用套件，其中包括：\n\r\n\r\nFirefox 114.0.1\n\r\nLibreOffice 7.5.3.2\n\r\nThunderbird 102.12.0\n\r\nBudgie、GNOME 和 MATE 版本的默认音乐播放器为 Rhythmbox\n\r\nBudgie 和 GNOME 上的视频播放使用 Celluloid\n\r\nMATE 上的视频播放使用 VLC Player\n\r\nPlasma 上的音频播放使用 Elisa，视频播放使用 Haruna\n\r\n\r\n你可以查看 发布公告 以深入了解这个重大版本更新。\n\r\n📥 下载 Solus 4.4\n\r\nSolus 的此版本有 四个不同的版本，你可以从 官方网站 获取它们。\n\r\n\r\nSolus 4.4\n\r\n\r\n\r\nvia: https://news.itsfoss.com/solus-4-4-released/\n\r\n作者：Sourav Rudra 选题：lkxed 译者：ChatGPT 校对：wxy\n\r\n本文由 LCTT 原创编译，Linux中国 荣誉推出",

          "description": "经过大约 16 年的演变，云计算已经成为一种几乎所有网民都在使用的技术。它可以作为一种服务，用于满足各类企业和消费者的需求。因此，在云计算中正在使用多种服务架构，旨在根据最新的需求来定制所需技术。本文就如今使用的所有服务架构，提供一份完全指南。\n\r\n\r\n尽管在全球范围内建立互相协同的计算机网络的构想在 20 世纪 60 年代初就提出了，但直到 2006 年，谷歌的首席执行官 埃里克·施密特Eric Schmidt 在当时的背景下引入了“云计算cloud computing”一词，这种构想才成为一种正式的概念。\n\r\n云计算可以简单理解为遍布于世界各地的远程服务器网络，通过互联网共享数据和协同工作，从而为企业和消费者提供服务。虽然这样的定义比较武断，但它包含了云计算背后的核心思想。促成这项技术发展的主要因素是对“数据粘性”的需求，就是令数据更容易被各种设备访问，同时也要减少数据丢失的风险。如果用户甲只在一台服务器上保存了数据，对于用户甲来说，只要有一台服务器中断，数据就很有可能永久性丢失。这种做法无异于“把所有鸡蛋放在同一个篮子里”，从来都不是一个好办法，特别是当你在处理对公司和消费者具有重要意义的数据时。但如果你在多台服务器上备份了用户甲的数据，将有两个主要好处：其一，即使一台服务器中断，用户甲仍然可以正常获取数据；其二，云服务可以从负荷最小的、离他最近的那台正常运作的服务器获取数据。这使用户甲可以在不同设备上更快、更容易地获取数据。\n\r\n历经大约 16 年的发展，云计算从起初只是一种用于备份图片的工具，变为了互联网的骨干。如今几乎所有的应用，从 Office 到 Asana 以及 Todolist，都利用云计算来实现实时访问和数据共享。几乎任意一款你能想像到的应用都在使用云计算。从 Gmail 和 YouTube，到Instagram，一切都使用云计算，以提供快速、便捷、可…",

          "description": "5G 并没有影响飞行安全\n\r\n2021 年末，就在 Verizon 计划在其持有的新 C 波段频谱上开通 5G 网络之前，美国航空业开展了一场大型公关活动，以 阻止 该网络的推出。航空业认为 5G 频段会对飞机上的高度计形成“重大干扰”，这种高度计对于飞机在雨天和其他可能影响能见度的情况下安全着陆至关重要。一些国际航空公司开始 减少 飞往美国的航班，航空业认为这甚至会导致“国家的商业陷入停滞”。这场对峙在去年夏天达到了高峰。经过公开的辩论后，Verizon 和 AT&T 同意将他们在一些机场附近的 5G 推广工作推迟到 7 月 1 日，以使航空业有时间将一些飞机高度计更新为不会受到 5G 影响的高度计。而到了最后期限 7 月 1 日，仅达美航空就预计约还有 190 架飞机需要加装新高度计。但这一天就这样悄然过去了，一家航班追踪公司称并没有发生“任何专门与 5G 有关的干扰”。\n\r\n\r\n消息来源：Light Reading\n\r\n\r\n\r\n老王点评：所以，飞机上使用手机影响飞行安全吗？\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n法官裁定表情符号 👍 表示签署合同\n\r\n一位谷物买家在 2021 年 3 月向一位农民发送了一条短信，称该公司希望购买 86 吨亚麻，在秋季交付。双方后来通了电话，买家发来一张 11 月交付亚麻的合同图片，还说 “请确认亚麻合同”。这位农民发回了一个竖起大拇指（👍）的表情符号。但当 11 月到来时，亚麻并没有交付，而且价格已经上涨。一位加拿大法官说，“（竖起大拇指）表情符号是一种非传统的文件‘签名’方式，但在这种情况下，这是一种传达‘签名’的两个目的的有效方式”，因此裁定农民违反了合同，并命令农民支付超过 82,000 美元违约金。农民辩称，这个表情符号只表明他在短信中收到了合同。\n\r\n\r\n消息来源：The Globe and Mail\n\r\n\r\n\r\n老王点评：看看你以后还敢随便发表情符号吗？\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\nThreads 不到 24 小时内突破 3000 万注册用户\n\r\nMeta 的新 Twitter 竞争对手 Threads 在 AppStore 上线的头两个小时就超过了 200 万注册人数，并且没有放缓的迹象。在前 7 个小时突破 1000 万注册人数后，又在不到 24 小时内达到 3000 万注册人数。Threads 现在也是最快突破 100 万用户大关的应用，打破了 ChatGPT 的记录。\n\r\n\r\n消息来源：Tech Crunch\n\r\n\r\n\r\n老王点评：虽然有 Instagram 的加成作用，但是也与马斯克的不断折腾有不少关系。",

          "description": "新的 Anaconda Web UI 安装程序可能会随 Fedora 工作站 39 一同推出。\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n长期以来，Fedora 的安装体验一直未曾改变。\n\r\n然而，这个新的 Web UI 安装程序已经开发了一年多的时间，现在离正式实现的目标更近了。\n\r\n为什么现在是时候了？\n\r\n在我们上次 了解 即将到来的 Anaconda WebUI 安装程序时，它的进展相当不错。\n\r\n而现在，它已经提交了一份 变更提案，旨在将这个安装程序添加到 Fedora 工作站中，以提供现代化的用户体验。该提案正等待 Fedora 工程和指导委员会（FESCo）的审查。\n\r\n让我们再次来看看即将到来的安装程序和提案，以及可以期待在 Fedora 发布中看到它的时间。\n\r\nAnaconda WebUI：概述 ⭐\n\r\n\n\r\n目前 Fedora 使用的旧的安装程序是基于 GTK3 的，在许多情况下已被证明效率低下和不安全。新的 Anaconda WebUI 安装程序旨在解决这个问题。\n\r\n它使用了一个由 Anaconda 团队开发的 基于 PatternFly 的现代后端和用户界面。\n\r\n后端由 Python、DBus、Cockpit、React 和 PatternFly 组成，旨在从一开始解决许多已知的用户体验问题，并为一致的安装体验铺平了道路。\n\r\n变更提案还提到了新 UI 的一些关键亮点，包括：\n\r\n\r\n向导式解决方案而非中心轮毂式。\n\r\n新的欢迎屏幕用于选择语言（将从系统中配置的语言预先选择）。\n\r\n时区和日期配置。\n\r\n磁盘选择。\n\r\n引导式分区。\n\r\n配置审核。\n\r\n安装进度。\n\r\n内置帮助。\n\r\n\r\n主要关注的重点是向用户提供类似向导的体验，提供更多信息，并帮助他们更好地完成安装过程。\n\r\n这个新安装程序添加了很多功能，听起来是一个很好的用户体验改变！ 😃\n\r\n那么，我们可以期待什么时候呢？\n\r\n由于这个变更需要经过 FESCo 的批准，一切取决于投票过程的进行。\n\r\n但是，我相当有信心这个变更会得到批准，因为 变更提案 已经设定了 在 Fedora 39 中发布新的 Anaconda WebUI 安装程序 的目标。\n\r\n💬 这个变更批准只是时间问题；您对此有什么看法？\n\r\n\r\nvia: https://news.itsfoss.com/fedora-workstation-39-webui/\n\r\n作者：Sourav Rudra 选题：lkxed 译者：ChatGPT 校对：wxy\n\r\n本文由 LCTT 原创编译，Linux中国 荣誉推出",

          "description": "电影海报是电影宣传中的一种视觉宣传工具，通常是以纸张或数字图片的形式展示的，用于吸引观众的注意力、传递电影的主题和情感，以及促进观众购票观影。电影海报通常在电影上映前和上映期间，在电影院、公共场所、网络和社交媒体等各种平台上广泛展示。\n\r\n\r\n电影海报的特点包括：\n\r\n\r\n1、醒目的视觉设计：电影海报通常采用醒目的视觉设计和艺术风格，以吸引观众的目光。通过视觉元素如图像、颜色、字体和布局等，传达电影的情感、主题和氛围。\n\r\n\r\n2、精准的内容传递：电影海报通过图像和文字相结合，精准地传递电影的故事梗概、主要角色和电影特色，让观众在一瞥之间了解电影的核心内容。\n\r\n\r\n3、促进观众购票：一个成功的电影海报能够激发观众的购票兴趣，让他们对电影产生好奇心和渴望观影的欲望，从而增加电影的观影率和票房收入。\n\r\n\r\n4、宣传品牌形象：电影海报是电影品牌形象的重要组成部分，一张令人印象深刻的海报可以树立起电影的独特形象和品牌价值，为电影的宣传和推广增色不少。\n\r\n\r\n5、多样化的设计风格：由于不同类型的电影有不同的主题和风格，因此电影海报的设计风格也会因电影类型的不同而多样化，包括手绘画风、摄影风格、插画风格等。\n\r\n\r\n电影海报除了是营销的一部分外，其自身也发展成一种艺术表现形式，它展示了世界上最棒的插画家、设计师的作品，这些作品融合了他们的巧思精功，还有大胆而富有创意的想法。\n\r\n\r\n从别出心裁的设计到标志性的剧照，再到学生最爱，我们选出了有史以来最棒的30张电影海报，它们足以闪耀电影院的墙壁橱窗——看看我们是否选到你心中所想。\n\r\n\r\n30、《阳光小美女》\n\r\n\r\n从电影本身到其市场营销，这幅海报的配色都是绝佳案例。不论是保罗·达诺的T恤，还是可爱却破破烂烂的大众露营车，黄色从这部暖心的圣丹斯大热门中散发出来，涌入预告片及海报里的角角落落。海报展示的影片关键元素——这辆房车不能顺…",

          "description": "在多名欧盟用户抱怨无法通过VPN访问Instagram的Threads应用后，Meta回应称正在阻止此类行为。该公司上周推出了Threads，但考虑到该应用的隐私问题，欧盟国家无法使用该应用。该公司在一份声明中称，已采取进一步措施阻止用户访问这款新的社交应用。\n\r\n\r\n\"Threads目前在大多数欧洲国家无法使用，我们已采取进一步措施阻止这些国家的用户访问Threads。欧洲仍然是Meta一个非常重要的市场，我们希望未来能够将Threads推向更多国家，\"Meta在向社交媒体顾问Matt Navarra提供的一份声明中表示。\n\r\n\r\n今天早些时候，一些欧盟用户开始在Twitter上发布截图，表示即使使用VPN也无法访问Threads应用。\n\r\n\r\n根据Meta的隐私政策和应用程序的iOS列表，Threads应用程序广泛跟踪用户，其中披露了该应用程序可能会收集一系列个人数据，包括高度敏感的信息，如健康和财务数据、精确位置、浏览历史、联系人和搜索历史。\n\r\n\r\n这种做法给Meta在欧盟的法律和监管带来了挑战。\n\r\n\r\n根据欧盟数据保护法，Meta需要有有效的法律依据才能合法地处理这些个人数据，用于广告定向--在最近的一项法院裁决之后，该公司在这一领域正面临着越来越多的不确定性。\n\r\n\r\n这还不是全部： 该集团新出台的反垄断制度--《数字市场法》（Digital Markets Act）也限制了守门巨头如何将数据用于广告投放。据报道，Meta公司将DMA如何适用于其数据使用的不确定性作为推迟在欧盟推出Threads的原因。\n\r\n\r\n尽管尚未在欧洲大部分地区正式推出，但Meta的Twitter竞争对手已经有了一个良好的开端，该应用在短短几天内注册人数就突破了1亿。\n\r\n\r\n然而，根据分析监测公司Sensor Tower的数据，与上周六相比，本周的日活跃用户数量下降了20%，在该应用上花费的时间也有所减少。因此，随着Meta版Twitter的新鲜感逐渐消失，Threads的热度是否会逐渐消退还有待观察。\n\r\n\r\n本周早些时候，Meta更新了Thread iOS应用，支持iOS 17，缩小了可执行文件的大小，并进行了其他小的改进。\n\r\n\r\n工程师卡梅隆-罗斯（Cameron Roth）在回应一篇有关缺乏移植到Web或桌面版支持的帖子时说，开发工作不像是用户移动手指\"打开它\"那么简单。\n\r\n\r\n稿源：cnbeta",

          "description": "Meta公司的新社交软件Threads已登陆美国苹果应用程序商店，这款社交应用预计将于7月6日正式发布，其与马斯克旗下的推特（Twitter）软件非常相似。\n\r\n\r\n据美国有线电视新闻网（CNN）7月4日报道，Meta公司创始人兼首席执行官扎克伯格，坐拥Facebook和Instagram两款社交软件，其公司预告了一款新的应用程序Threads，该软件将通过提供一个可在线实时对话的平台来与推特竞争。根据苹果应用程序商店的列表，它预计将于7月6日正式上线。根据苹果商店的描述，该应用似乎与推特有许多相似之处。\n\r\n\r\n“Threads是一个可以与他人一起讨论从你今天关心的主题到明天的趋势以及所有其他事情的社区。”上述描述写道，“无论你对什么感兴趣，你都可以关注并直接与你最喜欢的创作者和其他喜欢同样事物的人联系——或者建立自己的忠实追随者群体，与世界分享你的想法、观点和创造力。”\n\r\n\r\nMeta公司在近日发布Threads这一新软件的决定，可能受推特在7月初出现故障的影响，推特在故障结束后宣布对其用户能够阅读的推文数量进行了临时限制。马斯克说，这些限制是为了 \"解决极端程度的数据搜刮和系统操纵\"。\n\r\n\r\n马斯克7月3日在推特上评论了Threads，他说： \"谢天谢地，他们的运作是如此理智。“自2022年10月入主推特以来，马斯克对推特的运作方式进行了巨大的改动，他现在正在寻找让该平台恢复增长的方法。推特于7月3日宣布，用户很快需要为TweetDeck付费，这是一个可以让人们管理关注的账户的工具。\n\r\n\r\n另一边，推特也在试图蚕食Meta的领域。今年5月，推特增加了加密信息功能，并表示后续将推出通话功能，这些发展可能使该平台与同样属于Meta的Facebook Messenger和WhatsApp竞争。\n\r\n\r\n来源：澎湃新闻",

          "description": "马斯克当地时间7月1日表示，为了阻止“极端水平”的数据抓取和系统操纵，推特正在限制用户可阅读的推文数量：已验证的账户限制在每天阅读6000条推文，未验证的账户限制在每天600条推文，未验证的新账户限制在每天300条推文。 ​​​\n\r\n\r\n当地时间7月1日，数以万计的用户抱怨推特没有发布他们的新推文，用户会收到“超出限制”的错误提示。\n\r\n\r\n在一条推文中，马斯克详细介绍了修改后的使用配额。经过验证的帐户每天最多可以浏览6000条推文，而未经验证的账户则最多浏览600条推文。新注册的未经验证的账户面临着更严格限制，每天最多发300条推文。\n\r\n\r\n随后，马斯克又发布一条推文称，很快，已验证的账户浏览推文数量的限制将增加到8000条，未验证的账户将增加到800条，新注册的未验证用户将增加到400条。\n\r\n\r\n马斯克表示，推特正在努力应对“极端程度的数据抓取”和“系统操纵”。他说，这些新的限制是遏制这些紧迫问题的重要措施。他没有透露谁在抓取推特的数据，也没有说明这个问题持续了多长时间和详细解释系统如何被操纵。\n\r\n\r\n马斯克此前曾对推特上的数据抓取表示担忧，并暗示他可能会对不良行为者采取行动。今年4月，他对微软“非法”使用推特数据表示愤怒，显然是指微软与人工智能公司OpenAI的合作，OpenAI在“来自互联网的大量不同文本数据集”上训练人工智能模型，马斯克说，“他们非法训练使用推特数据。诉讼时间到了。”\n\r\n\r\n这并不是推特近几个月来遇到的第一个技术问题，也不是第一个为解决问题而设计的非常规解决方案。本周早些时候，推特开始限制未登录帐户的用户通过桌面和移动设备上的网络浏览器访问推文和个人资料。\n\r\n\r\n来源：澎湃新闻",

Cyber security, the societal impact of AI, data and privacy are important issues for legislators globally. At the same time, the COVID-19 pandemic drove collaborative development to unprecedented levels and took Open Source software, open research, open content and data from mainstream to main stage. Moving forward, developing these important public policies whilst not harming the ecosystem requires an understanding of how the Open Source ecosystem works. Ensuring stakeholders without historic benefit of representation are included in those discussions becomes paramount to that end.\n\nThe OPA will focus on educating public policy makers on Open Source to inform their development and deliberation of new policy concepts. There are unintended consequences that come from a lack of understanding of how open collaboration works in practice. The OPA will address this as well as the historic absence of contribution from underrepresented groups. The interest areas of the OPA community will complement those of Digitable Public Goods Alliance, a UNICEF multi-stakeholder initiative with a mission to accelerate the attainment of sustainable development goals in low- and middle-income countries that OSI joined earlier this year.",

The maple tree,\n\tresponsible for managing virtual memory areas, can undergo node\n\treplacement without properly acquiring the MM write lock, leading\n\tto use-after-free issues. An unprivileged local user could use this\n\tflaw to compromise the kernel and escalate their privileges.\n\n\tAs StackRot is a Linux kernel vulnerability found in the memory\n\tmanagement subsystem, it affects almost all kernel configurations\n\tand requires minimal capabilities to trigger. However, it should be\n\tnoted that maple nodes are freed using RCU callbacks, delaying the\n\tactual memory deallocation until after the RCU grace\n\tperiod. Consequently, exploiting this vulnerability is considered\n\tchallenging.\n\n\nThe disclosure contains a detailed description of the problem.
