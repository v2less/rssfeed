We are building software and hardware for training and inferencing ternary transformer models. Here's a video of the software: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqBn-I5D6pk.\nTransformer-based models are getting bigger every generation, making the inference hardware requirements more and more expensive. Running large transformer models on device is even more challenging. Usually, they require trillions of FLOPs to run at decent speeds and use too much energy and space.\nOur solution is to train ternary transformer models. There are two advantages to using ternary values. The first is that the weights can now be stored in two bits (or even less) from 16 bits. This represents an almost 8x compression ratio for every…",

          "description": "Hey all,\nI'm the founder of Flipt, an open-source  (https://github.com/flipt-io/flipt) feature flag tool that I (and others) have been working on for the past few years.\nAbout a year or two ago we added support for serving flag state from various non-relational declarative stores like Git, OCI, Object Store, etc.\nMany of our users came to love the git-backed storage, as it allows them to keep their feature flags close to their code in there organization's repos. But they had one (rather large) ask, and that was the ability to use the UI to manage flag state changes and still use Git as the backend.\nSo today we're rolling out our hosted solution that does exactly that (and more soon).\nI would love any feedback, questions, etc, or if anyone would give it a spin! Happy to extend the 14-day trial as well for anyone interested in providing product feedback.\nThanks!!\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41460061\nPoints: 10\n# Comments: 0",

          "description": "Hello, everyone!\nMy name is Alex, and I'm an expat in a new country. Two years ago, I moved to Germany where I didn’t know anyone. Starting the job, I realized that becoming close friends with colleagues can be quite challenging and slow. The feeling of loneliness was gradually growing.\nTo change that, I started attending various meetups based on my interests, hoping to make new friends. However, I often found myself answering the same generic questions that didn’t really help me understand if someone shared my values and interests. As a result, lost energy and 0 friends.\nSO - That’s when I began using icebreaking questions in smaller groups. Surprisingly, these questions quickly changed any conversation to a deeper, more engaging and meaningful level. I was able to identify people I genuinely connected with and started spending more time with them.\nBUT - preparing and using these questions was a pain. I would Google the top-100, pick a random number, and choose a question. I felt a strong need for a simple „one button“ that does everything for me.\nAND - After searching and not finding such a solution, I decided to build it myself. I created a vast database of questions across various topics and integrated AI to generate questions on any subject.\nThe idea has resonated well within my communities (university and expat parties), and more people are starting to use it. I’d love to hear your stories with icebreaking questions, your experience, and your feedback so I can make the service even more useful for more people!\nCheck it out and share your thoughts!\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41438542\nPoints: 17\n# Comments: 6",

Here’s a quick demo: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9n_eY-fM_E.\nWhy we’re doing this: Mechanical engineers excel at generating initial design concepts but get bogged down translating ideas into final designs due to tedious, repetitive tasks. Our goal is to automate these mundane processes, allowing engineers to focus on the creative aspects of design.\nHaving worked at multiple hardware companies—from medical devices to space launch vehicles—we know how often “trivial” components such as manufacturing rigging, get brushed under the table in scheduling conversations.

Basically, it wants to solve the problems encountered with current solutions:\n- slow typing\n- not easily configurable\n- keyboard layout dependent\n- constant bugs\nAdditionally, Afrim offers the following features [1]:\n- Dataset easily customizable\n- Keyboard layout independent\n- Auto completion, autocorrection and autosuggestion\n- Support all sequential codes\nTechnical details [2]:\nAfrim is written in Rust and his architecture is inspired of RIME.\nWhat's next?\n- Offer an android frontend of the Afrim (in development) [3]\n- Support more African input methods as possible\nI would like to have your opinions about this project. I have been working on it so far, and I would like to know how I can improve it.\n--------------\n[1] https://github.com/pythonbrad/afrim?tab=readme-ov-file#featu...\n[2] https://pythonbrad.github.io/afrim-man/for_developers\n[3] https://github.com/pythonbrad/afrim-keyboard/\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41427563\nPoints: 80\n# Comments: 33",

Skip is a tool that transpiles your SwiftUI iOS app into a Kotlin Jetpack Compose app, and enables you to use a single language to create a complete app that reaches the entire mobile marketplace.\nWhat it is: Skip stands in contrast to other cross-platform development tools like Flutter, React Native, and Xamarin, in that it enables the creation of genuinely native applications for both of the dominant mobile platforms. It doesn't embed a separate engine or runtime into your app, but instead lets you use pure Swift and SwiftUI to create the iOS side of the app (as per Apple's recommended best practices for creating iOS apps), and transpiles it into a pure Kotlin and Jetpack Compose app for the Android side (which is…",

It's like Github Copilot but with the most up-to-date information about your repo.\nWe made this because sometimes you just want to learn how a codebase works and how to integrate it, without spending hours sifting through the code itself.\nWe tried to make it dead-simple to use. With two scripts, you can index and get a functional interface for your repo. Every generated response shows where in the code the context for the answer was pulled from.\nWe also made it plug-and-play where every component from the embeddings, to the vector store, to the LLM is completely customizable.\nIf you want to see a hosted version of the chat interface with its features, here's a link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNVzmqRXUCA\nWe would love your feedback!\n- Mihail and Julia\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41383592\nPoints: 22\n# Comments: 3",

Before you've opened your laptop, Parity has conducted an investigation to triage, determine root cause, and suggest a remediation for an issue. You can check out a quick demo of Parity here: https://tryparity.com/demo\nWe met working together as engineers at Crusoe, a cloud provider, and we always dreaded being on-call. It meant a week of putting our lives and projects on hold to be prepared to firefight an issue at any hour of the day.  We experienced sleepless nights after being woken up by a PagerDuty alert to then find and follow a runbook.

          "description": "Hello HN!\nMy name is Patrick, and I am a junior at my High School’s FRC robotics team FRC 341 “Miss Daisy” (yes named after the movie). Every year, during the first weekend in January, a new robotics game is released (no it’s not battlebots). The game could be about launching balls into a goal, climbing monkeybars, or placing cubes on a see-saw. This year we were challenged to build a robot that could shoot orange foam donuts into a goal about 6 feet in the air. Here is a yt video with the game animation https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9keeDyFxzY4&t. After we received the game we then had six weeks to design, build, program, and field a robot capable of playing the game. And we did pretty well this year! I have attached a ChiefDelphi thread (robotics forum) where we have released our season materials. This being our CAD (3D model of robot), code, and design binder. I encourage you to take a look and leave any questions that you may have.\nThanks a lot!\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41340874\nPoints: 17\n# Comments: 6",

The tool builds a dependency graph between packages, allowing you to do things similar to what you can do in TurboRepo, like \"only test the packages and the packages that depend on them, compared to the main branch,\" or \"only install dependencies for Package A and its dependencies,\" etc. I use native go tool to get dependencies and create dependency graph between the package.Nothing crazy but I feel it could be useful.\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41332011\nPoints: 5\n# Comments: 0",

Here’s a quick demo video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bf-xTsDT5FQ. If you want to try it out directly, there are instructions below.\nWith Moonglow, you can start and stop pre-configured remote cloud machines within VSCode, and it makes those servers appear to VSCode like normal Jupyter kernels that you can connect your notebook to.\nWe built this because we learned from talking to data scientists and ML researchers that scaling up experiments is hard. Most researchers like to start in a Jupyter notebook, but they rapidly hit a wall when they need to scale up to more powerful compute resources. To do so, they need to spin up a remote machine and then a…",

For a basic CRUD app you need to spin up servers, wire up endpoints, integrate auth, add permissions, and then marshal data from the backend to the frontend and back again. If you want to deliver a buttery smooth user experience, you’ll need to add optimistic updates and rollbacks. We do these steps over and over for every feature we build, which can make it difficult to build delightful software.

Arva uses an AI agent to automate the manual verification that every banking/fintech does when they get a new business customer. This is called “Know Your Business” compliance (KYB for short) and it’s a royal pain.\nThere’s a demo video here: https://www.arva-ai.com/loom , and if you’re curious to try it out for yourself, you can onboard onto ‘Arva Bank’ and see what happens when you upload some fake documents: https://platform.arva-ai.com/demo (but please don’t upload any sensitive documents!)\nWhat’s this about? When a business onboards onto a bank or fintech (i.e. applies to be a customer), a human analyst has to conduct extensive manual verification a lot of the time. This causes long onboarding times, and there…",

It effectively turns computer programs into Lego bricks, to be torn down into pieces and reused into something new.\nIt supports the COFF and ELF object file formats, for the x86 and MIPS architectures. It has been successfully used on Linux, Windows and PlayStation executables. One user report is on a commercial video game from 2009 with a ~7 MiB Windows executable written in C++: it was delinked without its C runtime library and then relinked into a new executable at a different base address, with no visible change in functionality, as a prelude to a decompilation project.\nUse-cases I've demonstrated on my blog include modding, making software ports, converting executable file formats, creating libraries... I've originally built this as part of a video game decompilation project ; I've been working on this over the past 2.5 years and recently it has started gaining some users besides me.\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41318133\nPoints: 195\n# Comments: 32",

We’re Towaki and Allen, and we’re building Outerport (https://outerport.com), a distribution network for AI model weights that enables ‘hot-swapping’ of AI models to save on GPU costs.\n‘Hot-swapping’ lets you serve different models on the same GPU machine with only ~2 second swap times (~150x faster than baseline). You can see this in action through a live demo where you try the same prompts on different open source large language models at https://hotswap.outerport.com and see the docs here https://docs.outerport.com.\nRunning AI models on the cloud is expensive.

MinusX is a Chrome extension (https://minusx.ai/chrome-extension) that adds an AI sidechat to your analytics apps. Given an instruction, our agent operates your app (by clicking and typing, just like you would) to analyze data and answer queries. Broadly, you can do 3 types of things: ask for hypotheses and explore data, extend existing notebooks/dashboards, or select a region and ask questions.

          "description": "Hello!\nI recently wanted to learn a bit about computer vision. Initially, I wanted to build something which could solve a jigsaw puzzle, but figured I should start with something (much) simpler, so I've built this instead.\nThis is a visual Sudoku solver which runs in the browser. It works by using OpenCV to identify and process the Sudoku grid, passing this to a simple ML model to identify the digits, and then solving the puzzle with a backtracking algorithm. The ML model was trained on the TMNIST data set using a model built with Keras, also a completely new area to me.\nIt's far from perfect, and doesn't like non perfectly lit or overly warped puzzles, but the main goal here was learning, which I did, a lot.\nAs this was primarily a learning project, I've tried to document my approach as much as possible, which can be found in this Python notebook:\nhttps://github.com/Taiters/sudoku-solver/blob/main/notebooks...\nI used Python while exploring OpenCV and training the models etc, and eventually ported this over to web (OpenCV.js + Tensorflow.js) to get something I could actually share with people.\nFeel free to have a dig around the source or play around with the solver!\nGithub: https://github.com/Taiters/sudoku-solver\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41299594\nPoints: 37\n# Comments: 10",

          "description": "tl;dr we built an embeddable stream processing engine in Rust using apache DataFusion, check us out at https://github.com/probably-nothing-labs/denormalized\nHey HN,\nWe’d like to showcase a very early version of our embeddable stream processing engine called Denormalized. The rise of DuckDB has abundantly made it clear that even for many workloads of Terabyte scale, a single node system outshines the distributed query engines of previous generation such as Spark, Snowflake etc in terms of both performance and cost.\nNow a lot of workloads DuckDB is used for were normally considered to be “big data” in the previous generation, but no more. In the context of streaming especially, this problem is more acute. A streaming system is designed to incrementally process large amounts of data over a period of time. Even on the upper end of scale, productionized use-cases of stream processing are rarely performing compute on more than tens of gigabytes of data at a given time.\nEven so, the standard stream processing solutions such as Flink involve spinning up a distributed JVM cluster to even compute against the simplest of event streams. To that end, we’re building Denormalized designed to be embeddable in your applications and scale up to hundreds of thousands of events per second with a Flink-like dataflow API. While we currently only support Rust, we have plans for Python and Typescript bindings soon.\nWe’re built atop DataFusion and the Arrow ecosystems and currently support streaming joins as well as windowed aggregations on Kafka topics.\nPlease check out out repo at: https://github.com/probably-nothing-labs/denormalized\nWe’d love to hear your feedback.\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41258276\nPoints: 79\n# Comments: 17",

          "description": "10 years ago I began working on Muki, a web-based MIDI and chiptune player which I eventually announced here on HN[0]. It was a fun weekend project.\nOver the years I received numerous requests from people that wanted more: more music, more features, more playable formats, you name it.\nEventually I began working on a complete rewrite of the app (this time for real), and, realizing that each year another chiptune or MIDI website went offline, I decided to start archiving them for preservation.\nToday, 10 years after the first release, I think it's finally time for the new, nicer version to hit the shelves. It's now called Pixeltune and yes, now you can actually turn down the volume. :)\nHope you like it!\n[0] https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=10305918\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41218811\nPoints: 13\n# Comments: 1",

But for my job, occasionally I need to run full-fledged Word or Excel, and I'm used to PaintNET and Affinity Photo for high quality image editing that I do for publications, I also really like Wondershare Filmora video editor. I am debating which is the best alternative and wondering what other Linux users do in this situation?\n Dual-boot? A hassle having to jump back and forth between the two OS, not to mention having to keep up with Windows updates. I'd rather forget Windows exists as native OS.\n Wine/Proton? As of 2024 it still seems a convoluted process, pollutes your distro with Windows executables and libraries (eww) and of course there are no guarantees the specific app needed will run.\n Local virtual machine? - Not ideal if you are using a laptop on battery often as the performance overhead will drain the battery faster, also it just feels slow and thefore annoying to use.\n Cloud virtual machine? I never tried it before, I wonder what's the performance like, but surely it requires adding a monthly expense.\n RDP into a Windows PC? This is the one I am most inclined to, even though I don't have a separate desktop PC right now, but I tried Parsec to someone else's laptop and it really has low latency streaming if the connection is good, it's quite usable, more so than a virtual machine.\n Any other possibilities I am missing?\n    submitted by    /u/vanwaldi  \n [link]   [comments]",

However, he could not access the screen reader through the installation process which rendered it completely inaccessible to him.\n I did some research and found that Kali has some trouble with the screen reader for the terminal, which people seem to solve by installing and using gnome as default DE. \n I tried to help him remotely, but we haven't had any success. Unfortunately, today I can't videocall him to help with the installation. \n So I came here asking for help: could you reccommend an accessible distro for people who need screen readers?

I was also very surprised by the speed and responsiveness of the OS in general.\n This makes me very tempted to switch to Ubuntu as a daily driver, especially as the list of Windows apps and games that are also being developed for Linux, or that work with popular compatibility layers (Wine, Proton, etc.), is constantly growing. Unfortunately, though, I closely rely on Microsoft's Office suite for work with classmates, and after trying LibreOffice, Wine, and the web version of Office 365, nothing compares to the native Windows app.\n What is Linux missing?\n Why are so many people/organizations still relying on an old and outdated OS like Windows?\n How long will it take for people to realize that Linux is the better choice?\n    submitted by    /u/Firm-Garbage-8188  \n [link]   [comments]",

I use two separate drives, and each have their own EFI.\n Windows does this annoying thing, where it will install its EFI stuff in any EFI partition it finds on any disk, even if it's not the disk you want to install to... but I thought of a neat workaround for this that doesn't require \"unplugging your Linux drive\" sorts of fixes... by instead, basically changing your Linux EFI type to something else temporarily, and then back.\n  \nBoot a live Linux distro (eg. Arch installer)\n Change your Linux EFI partition type from EF00 (EFI) to 8300 (Linux Filesystem) using gdisk (gdisk /dev/<disk> -> t (change partition's type code) -> Partition # (probably 1) -> 8300 -> w (write out))\n Install Windows (It won't find an EFI and will make its own on the same disk you're installing to)\n Boot back into a live Linux distro, and change the code back.\n gdisk /dev/<disk> -> t (change partition's type code) -> Partition # (probably 1) -> EF00 -> w (write out))\n  \nThis was helpful for me, as my drive isn't easily disconnectable (NVME), and my bios didn't seem to offer a way to \"disable\" the drive temporarily.

          "description": "One major issue with Linux distributions is that for each piece of software, there's a package for Debian, Arch, Fedora, Ubuntu, etc. Binaries are usually compiled dynamically linked (as opposed to statically linked), which means the libraries aren't contained in the binaries themselves, rather they're linked to system libraries. Therefore, you can't just run a binary from your Arch system on a Debian-based system. Many people say the solution to this issue is Flatpak, Snaps, and AppImages. These don't really address the real problem though. The actual solution is compiling statically linked binaries. This would also make it easier for developers to make binaries for Linux knowing they can be ran on any distribution.\n    submitted by    /u/SaltyMaybe7887  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hey all! Ever since I first discovered Linux, I've been quite interested in it. I like how linux is private and anonymous, unlike Windows. How it's so customizable to your like and taste. I'm not really a fan of Windows, I gotta admit. But so far, the advantages of Windows over Linux still kinda make me hesitant to really make the switch. Yeah, gaming is very doable now thanks to software advances with programs such as Wine and Steam's Proton. But unfortunately, some games still don't run on Linux, or they do, but not flawless. Especially multiplayer games which use anti-cheat software. Unfortunately some or most of them are apparently borderline malware, with how deep they can be nestled/rooted in the OS once installed. I've got an Nvidia graphics card, and though I found out there are linux drivers for them, I'm not sure how good it is compared to Windows. On my pc I've got Nvidia GeForce experience which neatly notifies me when there's a driver update. If I don't get a notification I just don't update. I don't want to manually check for updates every time I boot up my pc. Also I've already got plenty of stuff installed on my pc, and I'm not exactly thrilled if I have to reinstall all of it, if I switch to Linux. So far Microsoft haven't really done anything that I know of that made me determined to switch to Linux.\n    submitted by    /u/SpaceSloth707  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "hello,\n I keep a diary, a very long text file and Linux is wonderful with its scripting abilities for support of it. For example I have a scripts like \"open the diary on the last page so I can write today's entry\" \"insert a header with current date and day of the week for current entry\" \"insert a fortune cookie message of the day taken from the fortune(6) application\" \"open the diary on a pseudo-random page so I can reflect the past\" (this is better than opening a paper diary on a pseudo-random page because you don't involve whether it will be entry from the beginning of the diary or the end) \n all this is done by combining the command line switches and \":r!\" commands in Vim with custom Perl scripts. I don't know how much it will take to make something like that on WIndows, you will probably have to create your own application in Delphi which is cumbersome. \n tried to post this to r/linuxmasterrace but they don't allow text posts, I guess it is OK here, since it involves Linux and Linux is praised\n    submitted by    /u/danielsoft1  \n [link]   [comments]",

Within this time-frame I used mostly openSUSE Tumbleweed and the latest Fedora.\n Well, the first laptop died within 3 years, and had some weird CPU spikes, and resume from suspend was hit or miss. Also I had to deal with broadcom drivers constantly breaking with kernel updates.\n The second laptop had frequent freezes causing the session to hang and require cold reboots. I tried several solutions and kernel parameters but the issue remained to this day. \n The third laptop, with RX dGPU, constantly flickers when connecting to a external FreeSync 144hz display.\n My most recent purchase was finally a Intel laptop with Xe graphics (LG Gram), and behold, I have none of these issues at all. Wayland, suspend and resume, external displays, battery runtime equal to Windows, all works great. It might be just luck with this particular model but honestly it made me regret my past purchases.\n Since then I have learned more about Intel active and timely contributions to the Linux kernel and I am hoping the layoffs won't cause that to decrease.\n Either Intel has been improving a lot these last few years or AMD has been overhyped, but the hassle free experience with a Intel laptop has made me hesitant with going to AMD+NVIDIA on my next desktop build, I am Seriously considering going with Intel CPU+Arc GPU.\n    submitted by    /u/vanwaldi  \n [link]   [comments]",

I was ten, a daughter of impoverished parents living in a midwestern trailer park, and had been given this crappy old PC by my uncle. The OS was corrupted, he didn't have a license key, and I was about to chuck the thing when someone gave me a set of Mandriva install CDs.\n I remember the process being a tremendous pain in the ass and taking a long time, but I ended up with a working install, and the KDE 3.5 desktop. We did have what passed for high-speed internet access at the time (while living on hot dogs and cheesy mac), so I was able to engage with the community, learn a lot, and work around problems.

Our patented design allows for the camera to be applied directly onto any type of fabric completely accessory-free.\n On the software side, the top action cameras in the market allow you to only stream footage from the device to your app - our app allows to stream the footage from Ucam globally.\n We already have a stellar lineup of investors and advisors, including a former NBA Champion & DPOY, WNBA All-Stars, the CDO of 3Step Sports, one of the Atlanta Dream team owners, and the Executive VP of HoopGroup, to name a few.\n  \nWe're currently seeking a firmware engineer to add to the team.

It was one of the earliest kde 6 adopter and latest kernel is great for how rapidly gaming is growing on Linux. They also do some testing before shipping the updates and it's the default os that ships with their hardware so you can be sure it'll work. Wayland is used by default. Flatpak and nvidia drivers are pre-installed. Snaps are removed (I know they're preferred for servers but majority don't like them on personal computers so this is still a plus).\n What do you guys think about it?\n Edit: They're also KDE patron and organize their events in Tuxedo offices, i think that's pretty nice.\n    submitted by    /u/nikunjuchiha  \n [link]   [comments]",

Linux-based operating systems have existed for decades and have evolved into all possible directions.

          "description": "Hello everyone,\n Just a random thought I had recently. I've been using Linux for awhile now. I switched to linux because of cfd being faster in linux and because of technologies like docker, lxc and chroot. In addition, I had some amazing fun playing with linux on my phone via termux too. I still dual boot windows, but I'm slowly just using linux for most things. So effectively I'm in the windows --> linux camp. I see myself most comfortable with kde and I enjoy themes that compliment that workflow.\n However I've known friends who prefer gnome and use macOS like themes, and not so surprisingly is also from a MacOS --> Linux camp. So this got me thinking, can the choice of someone's preferred DE and theme be a good indication of where they are switching from?\n Please share your thoughts on the matter! Let me know (if you dual boot or fully switched) what OS you used to use before coming to linux and if you have a prefered DE and theme?\n Thanks 🫡\n    submitted by    /u/EternalSeekerX  \n [link]   [comments]",

When I heard all the telemetry news, and when i saw how badly my laptop was taking windows, i had enough. It also helped that I'm a developer and switched to vim/nvim (still not sure which one i like more), and i use git bash all the time. And getting that to run on windows is just a hassle. On linux it's a breeze. Not to mention being fed up with the lack of customization for keybinds and general appearance.\n I spent one day. Backing up all my stuff. And then booted linux mint from a USB. Installed it, fiddled with the drivers/kernels (it still has some graphics/display issues unfortunately :/) and MAN... My Laptop hit record low temps, 50-60° idle, one time i saw even 43°! Everything is so quick to load and work with. Loving the command line way of doing things as well. I love the sense of security and calmness that comes with it all. I just feel at ease again. And i can focus on my work.\n I had to keep windows as dual boot unfortunately because of stuff required by my organizations.

          "description": "I'm pretty new to linux as my daily system and most of my scripting has been used for small work tasks. \n I just installed Pop Os and found the application Komorebi which is used for wallpapers and for my case live wallpapers. I came from windows as my daily driver and used Wallpaper Engine for this and was hoping to find a way to emulate that on my linux machine.\n I didn't want to have to go out and find downloads for videos to turn into wallpapers myself so I build a script that taps into the workshop directory of steam for Wallpaper Engine (installed using proton) and migrates them to Komorebi by making configs and extracting a frame for the thumbnail.\n This allows me to launch the wallpaper engine UI and use it to find wallpapers I want and then migrate them on demand.\n Obviously there will likely be bugs but I'm pretty proud of it.\n I put it up in my public repo and I'm going to continue to improve it where I can. If this is something you're interested in trying here's the link. Included a short video here to show the various wallpapers I pulled into Komorebi from Wallpaper Engine.

          "description": "Hey r/linux,\n Nano is installed on most Linux systems nowadays since it has replaced vi as the default text editor in most distributions for years now. That means most of us are probably using it quite frequently, possibly without even thinking about it when it is called by default (e.g., when using visudo, or when editing a commit message for a git merge operation on a remote host we SSH'd into), but also some of us may be explicitly using it to edit remote config files, editing file as root even locally, or maybe even for programing?\n I actually do use it to program when I'm live coding in front of my students, because I can open it in tmux which allows me to have the same editor on my laptop's screen and on the big display my students see without having to duplicate screen so I can have other notes for myself for example (also, it's good for them to see that it is possible even in 2024 to code using simple tools that runs on your own computer rather that editing files directly on GitHub or wherever…).\n Because of that, I came to realize what an under appreciated gem nano actually is. Recent discussions on HN and here lead me to wonder how to showcase and discuss nano's features, so I thought why not share our .nanorc files?\n I'll copy mine in a comment below :).\n For those of you who never bothered to customize nano, be sure to check the `nanorc` man page, and to not miss its \"REBINDING KEYS\" section which lists the various and sometimes quite advanced editing functions most people ignore that nano has: syntax highlighting, line numbering, auto-indent, multi buffers, mouse support, keyboard macros, …\n So, do you use nano? What for? What does your .nanorc look like if you have one? What is your favorite nano feature? \n    submitted by    /u/p4bl0  \n [link]   [comments]",

So the title is intended as a colloquialism and not so much click bait. In candor, I think this is the tech fad of the month, Linux talk will slow down back to normal and maybe a marginally faster mid term growth. Linux being at 5.2% in 18 months is optimistic, but not unrealistic.\n There is so much pro-Linux and anti-Windows talk in tech communities that aren't even Linux or SOG centric, sure Level1techs made benchmarks, but a lot of other outlets are referencing it. Tom from \"Moore's Law is Dead\" says the Linux Desktop readyness is will be there in 5 to 10 years and we might be there by then and I expect somebody like him to be more skeptical than he was. Tom's Guide (different Tom) installed SteamOS on The ROG Ally X and there was better performance and battery life and DankPods. This is anecdotal, but I follow a variety streamer that I don't think I heard her talk about Linux ever and she tried streaming a Vtuber setup that uses Unreal Engine and heaven knows what and she streamed from the Deck from Proton and it was very choppy and I said \"I think DXVK is compiling shaders and the more you do those effects, the bigger shader cache you'll get and it will stop chopping\". The stream eventually crashed, but considering it's a handheld and it's going through all that translation, I'm surprised it ran that well even though it crashed. She plans on not doing that on the deck until AMD/Valve makes a encoder Driver for Windows.\n    submitted by    /u/commodore512  \n [link]   [comments]",

I cannot imagine myself using windows. Everything is worse and counterproductive. Heck even filemanager doesn't have tabs (as of windows 10) forget about ftp, nfs, sftp, ssh, like dolphin. You can install apps that simulate krunner but its nowhere as good. And not to even mention compiling anything on windows or drivers situation. On linux everything works ootb on windows not so much. Package managers like chocolatey work but they're shadow of what normal package manager is on linux. I had simple qt app that i wanted to compile for windows and after bashing my head against the wall and repeatedly kicking myself in the balls for week i gave up because its simply not possible.\n But hey, games work i guess?

My second time ever trying linux(last time probably 15 years ago, and I gave up). \n It has been completely revolutionary. Finally I can have a almost 90% keyboardbased workflow, not having to deal with terrible laptop touchpads. \n It did take me almost 3 full working days and 2 reinstalls to get it up and running in a proper way. Been fighting with wifi drivers, fixing suspend for closing the lid etc. But it’s finally up and running. Batterytime doubled, runs cool and no fans suddenly spinning for no apparent reason. ChatGPT has been the biggest savior for getting it set up. It spews a lot of garbage and confidently tells you wrong instructions, but for basic setup it seems to hit the mark with a far higher accuracy than browsing rude forum posts from 2009. \n Debian w/ i3 is obviously still terrible at being user friendly, and almost everything is a hassle the first couple of times, but at least you feel respected as a user. \n    submitted by    /u/kunstner0  \n [link]   [comments]",

And, I always hated the screen share here. Even after changing Ozone platform to Wayland in chromium, it crashes after a while. Screen share on Firefox also doesn't work.\n So today, I had to share my screen for work. I just installed i3 and I thought to myself, why not try it in TTY.\n So long story short, I was using Hyprland on TTY1 and then on another TTY, I launched i3 and shared the screen.\n The experience was so smooth. And, I was surprised that I could use multiple window managers without logging out and switching to other. I could just switch between TTYs to use different window managers / compositor.\n I would like to know if there are any problems that could occur from this.\n    submitted by    /u/mashood951  \n [link]   [comments]",

Y'all remember the days when Netflix was a PITA to get working correctly (looking at you, MS Silverlight), gaming on Linux wasn't a thing, I don't remember if Spotify was available for Linux, and a bunch of other stuff SUCKED if you wanted it on Linux.\n During those days, it became very clear to me that Progressive Web Apps (PWAs) were going to be invaluable for my user experience on Linux.

          "description": "Hey everyone! I ran into a funny (and slightly stressful) situation while installing Ubuntu on my Raspberry Pi 5, and I thought I’d share it here. Maybe it’ll help someone, or at least give you a good laugh.\n So, I’ve got a Bluetooth mouse and a Bluetooth keyboard. But, as it turns out, during the Ubuntu installation, they’re pretty much useless because the keyboard won’t connect. I ended up stuck on the screen where you need to enter your username, computer name, and password. And that’s when I realized—without a keyboard, I’m totally screwed. 🤦‍♂️\n After digging through some old boxes, I managed to find an ancient wired mouse—my savior (well, almost). The first steps of the installation, like choosing the language and localization, went smoothly, but then came the part where I had to type stuff… and that’s where things got tricky.\n I started frantically Googling for a solution on my phone, and then I accidentally noticed that I could highlight the text labels in the form fields. Right-clicked, and boom—there were options to “Copy” and “Paste.” That’s when it hit me! I started copying and pasting letters and words from these labels to fill in all the fields.\n One letter at a time, one symbol at a time, but I finally made it through the installation! 😅\n Afterward, I managed to get the Bluetooth keyboard working, and everything was fine. But this experience is something I’ll definitely remember for a long time.\n So, if anyone ever finds themselves in a similar mess—don’t give up! There’s always a way out. And big thanks to my old wired mouse for saving the day. 🖱️\n    submitted by    /u/Ktyby  \n [link]   [comments]",

I used Linux a while back for personal computing, and really wanted to make the switch again. I'm not really a fan of a lot of things that MS is doing (like the forced CoPilot) and figured I would be just a productive on Linux (I chose Kubuntu). Unfortunately, after many hours, I just am not.\n My role is that of an analyst and ad-hoc (not production) dev. For tasks like coding and SQL queries, and our web-based front end tools, Linux is fine. Not really any better than Windows, but not holding me back. However, my org is heavy into the MS ecosystem, and that's where the issues arise. \n Web based office sucks. It's workable for basic word and excel tasks, so I figured I could use that and a VM for more complex tasks. Which I could, but it's nowhere near as seamless as on a Windows machine (where I never work on any Office docs in a browser). Web based outlook kind of sucks, and Thunderbird just doesn't offer the full outlook experience with the multiple calendars and inboxes I have to manage.\n The other issue is I would have to ditch Google Drive.

Please note this tutorial won't work on X11 (I'm pretty sure it should work out of the box on X11 on Intel graphics). This has been tested on Chromium 127, using MESA 24.1.6 on Plasma 6.1.4 Wayland and Fedora 40, using Intel Ice Lake graphics (10th generation). This will likely work for other Chromium-based browsers, like Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge, Opera, Vivaldi, etc.\n All you need to do is to enable the following arguments:\n --ozone-platform=wayland --enable-features=VaapiVideoDecodeLinuxGL,VaapiVideoEncoder --ignore-gpu-blocklist\n On Plasma, you can use the Menu Editor application to add those arguments to the \"Command-Line Arguments\" field (append them at the end), after that, all you have to do is to save your changes and restart your browser. On other desktop environments you might have to edit the Exec line on the .desktop shortcut of your browser, usually located either in /home/your_username/.local/share/applications/ or /usr/share/applications/ (you can use sudo nano /usr/share/applications/browser_name.desktop to edit the files there, or another editor with root support of your choice)\n To confirm it's working, you can install the intel-gpu-tools package for your distribution (sudo apt install intel-gpu-tools on Ubuntu, sudo dnf install intel-gpu-tools on Fedora, and so on) and run sudo intel_gpu_top, then, play a video and check in the terminal if the video usage percentage goes above zero.\n I hope that helps!\n    submitted by    /u/Cleytinmiojo  \n [link]   [comments]",

It consists of a Chrome extension, and a Python script. The extension will add a button on YouTube videos which are available in HDR. Clicking this button will launch MPV, which will play the video in HDR. The Python script is the one that actually launches MPV, once it receives a request from the Chrome extension. \n Tested on Manjaro KDE, can work on Gnome too, as long as you are able to get HDR working on MPV, which seems possible\n Installation instructions and guide - GitHub Link\n Enjoy!\n    submitted by    /u/pee_wee__herman  \n [link]   [comments]",

I stumbled upon a video by CG Geek that benchmarks Blender on Windows and Linux, showing that Blender on Linux is about twice as fast. After that, I immediately installed Linux Mint Cinnamon as my first distribution and have been using Linux as my main operating system ever since.\n I did face some challenges such as needing to install drivers for my TP-Link WiFi adapter. However, I'm really glad I stumbled across that one video because I didn't even know Linux existed before seeing it. Windows was constantly frustrating me and I thought I had to be stuck with it. Now, I understand that the benefits of Linux go far beyond just speed. Linux is free, hogs less of my memory, crashes programs less often, is more customizable, and much better for software development.\n    submitted by    /u/SaltyMaybe7887  \n [link]   [comments]",

I have also found myself to be more comfortable and familiar with Linux systems than Windows after using Linux since I started tech school.

Works.\n Game performance? Equal or better in my case.\n I never expected to run into problems with python and i didnt visual studio works good too.\n Lm studio for local llms works a bit different and while on win it didnt see option for endless generation now\n it only generates endlessly and prompt itself which is weird but fine.\n a1111 and comfyui works flawlessly.\n Installing aps with command line is in my opinion actually less of hassle than uncheking million of ad boxes in standard win installators\n My only complain is that pop shop is a bit laggy but cosmic shop is there and works much better.\n In all my 60 days of using pop_os i only once needed to use my windows laptop and it was to play league of legends.

On windows, if you do not select \"Keep Originals\", it will auto convert HEIC to JPG when importing using File Explorer or Photos App.\n  \nMount your iphone via USB\n  \nThere are many ways to do this and I can't remember how I did it. I don't have ifuse installed. Pair your computer to the phone. You might have to try different ports, different cables. lsusb to see if it's connected.\n  \nInstall gthumb.\n  \nLog out, log back in. Gthumb is great because it will only import new photos on subsequent transfers.\n  \nPlug in your phone. On the phone, you will meet pop up boxes. \"Trust\" your computer and \"allow\" photo transfers.\n  \nThat's it. Hope this helps.\n ps. Why HEIC? It's smaller than JPG.

A few days ago I came across a fork of the project which is actively maintained and is much easier to setup (it's still annoying to do but still quiet a bit easier).\n It It runs on docker or podman container of windows which you can RDP to access the container. It runs a VM but it's automatically configured by docker and runs very well. Runs even better than linux distros on kvm. It also integrates with the desktop(at least on GNOME) and I can also acess /home folder.\n I tried using it for office apps (word, powerpoint and excel) and it works very well. It officially supports adobe apps and a few more but I couldn't assign more than 4GB of RAM to the docker container so I haven't really tried it.\n It's a really great project and I'm really surprised that there is no talk about it on reddit or on youtube.\n Github Link\n If you want to set it up for yourself, the instructions are on the github link. Here are a few issues I ran into and how to solve them:\n  \nOn the installing windows step the host used it really really slow and it's much better to use an iso that you download yourself and use as such.\n While creating the configuration file change the value of RDP_USER to the windows username which is probably \"Docker\" and RDP_PASS to the password which is initially empty.\n To run the apps you need to start the container, go the localhost log out of windows otherwise the apps won't start. To solve this just create an extra windows user and disable auto-login.\n  \nP.S. I tried to upload it a few days ago but it didn't get moderator approval. It wasn't rejected either, maybe noboby looked at it. This is uploaded without any changes except the P.S.\n    submitted by    /u/greatbacon02  \n [link]   [comments]",

Use $ switcheroo-ctl list to verify.\n To go even further,\n ~/.local/share/applications/glxgears-igpu.desktop\n Type=Application Name=glxgears on iGPU Icon=glxgears Exec=glxgears Terminal=true PrefersNonDefaultGPU=false X-KDE-RunOnDiscreteGpu=false \n ~/.local/share/applications/glxgears-dgpu.desktop\n Type=Application Name=glxgears on dGPU Icon=glxgears Exec=glxgears Terminal=true PrefersNonDefaultGPU=true X-KDE-RunOnDiscreteGpu=true \n What do you guys think of making .desktop files for command line utilities?

          "description": "Nowadays, Linux is very easy to use for the average user in popular distros. GNOME and KDE are excellent desktop environments, which has allowed many people to switch to a simple distro like Ubuntu or Linux Mint without missing their old systems. I have been using Linux as my primary system for about two years, and I've learned a lot. Broadly speaking, I've noticed two types of Linux users:\n  \nFOSS User: Concerned with open source and security.\n Just Works User: Only interested in a system that works.\n  \nBoth types of users are fine with me (though I identify more with the first). However, Linux's philosophy is very focused on open source and respecting user data. Now, here's my doubt (or fear): It seems that big companies are increasingly eyeing Linux, and we might see many Windows/macOS apps here, whether through Flatpak, Flathub, or something similar. I also see a lot of hardware support, but much of that is closed source, which doesn't align with Linux's philosophy. \n So, it appears that the mainstream market is starting to focus on Linux, but they don't care about its philosophy. And if the mainstream market turns its attention to Linux, the masses will follow. But the masses don't care about the philosophy (and I'm not saying that's wrong). It seems that this niche that was once free from monitoring and malware might turn into an environment just like the one we were trying to escape from. Smaller distros might have to shift to this new model as they see that distros less aligned with the philosophy, like Ubuntu or Fedora, will grow. \n I don't know, does anyone else share this doubt, or am I exaggerating?\n    submitted by    /u/GidiomGates  \n [link]   [comments]",

I used a new notebook for this endeavor, not my old MBP.\n So, I started out where probably a lot of new users started out, by searching for \"most beginner-friendly Linux distro\" and ended up with Linux Mint, which as far as I know is a commonly proposed option for new Linux users.

          "description": "I used to use DWM before I switched to KDE Plasma because I like having a desktop environment that I don't need to take a lot of time to set up. I also switched because I think graphical user interfaces are often a much easier way of configuring things than editing a configuration file. It's so much easier to change my display configuration with a GUI than xrandr.\n One thing I do miss from DWM is having automatic window tiling. Right now I'm using the krohnkite plugin for KWin which kind of gets the job done but it's not perfect. Instead of the window manager natively tiling windows, the plugin uses KWin's tiling API. I can see windows floating after opening for a short period of time before the plugin arranges it into the correct tile. This goes against the Wayland philosophy of “every frame is perfect.” In contrast, tiling window managers like Sway and Hyprland have windows automatically spawn in the correct location with the right dimensions.\n Since plugins are buggy and not as smooth as native tiling, I think desktop environments should natively support window tiling. I know Cosmic exists, but it has that dreaded Gn*me look.\n    submitted by    /u/SaltyMaybe7887  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Before you get out your pitch forks and try to burn me at the stake, here me out.\n On Linux, we have so many choices, which is great, and I'm all for it. It's a good thing.\n BUT... IMO there are so many distros out there that are essentially just trash.\n A large percentage of them have only minor changes. They may come with one or two packages installed by default, that you could easily install on any other linux system with a simple \"install\" command. Maybe they set a wallpaper, or a minor tweak to whatever DE they decide to use, maybe a different splash screen on startup etc...\n They don't truly offer anything unique. Nothing different about the development philosophy, they just make minor changes and slap a bad name on it \"Super Fast Extreme Linux\". Most of the time, they have terrible support and stability.\n To use an analogy. It's like searching for a product on Amazon, seeing 4 or 5 good versions of the product, and then the rest of the search is just filled with cheap Chinese trash.\n Freedom, choice, and the ability to make whatever you want is a wonderful thing. But IMO, all of the man power, man hours, and human effort would be better spent contributing to existing, unique projects that actually have something to offer. Instead of everyone trying to go there own way, just for the sake of going their own way.\n So if you're starting a project, please consider looking for one that is already out there that is heading in the same direction, and contribute to that. If we consolidated just a little bit, I think the whole community would be better off for it, and have more man power to get things done.\n UPDATE: Some of you seem to think I want to force people to do things and I hate freedom somehow. This is not the case. The post is merely a plea for other people to explore existing projects, to see if they could be happy aligning themselves with said project, in order to make further progress instead of working alone.\n    submitted by    /u/Wigglingdixie  \n [link]   [comments]",

This makes integrating your phone with the car easier because it uses a UI that looks familiar across all cars. \n CarPlay and AA work with iPhones and Androids, respectively. But what about Linux phones?\n The closest thing you can get to a CarPlay/AA for a Linux phone is by using Waydroid and installing the AA app on it, but that only mirrors the Waydroid subsystem, not the Linux phone OS.\n For Linux phones to take off more, there should be another CarPlay/AA-like system that gives the phone a blank Wayland compositor or X server. Then, an app like KDE Connect can put its own stuff there to give you a car UI that looks like the phone UI.\n Of course, car manufacturers won't implement this because Linux phones are a niche thing and they haven't become mainstream yet.\n What do you guys think? Should what I described above be in all cars, or should we just use AA instead?\n    submitted by    /u/User_8395  \n [link]   [comments]",

To put it into perspective, Linux starts enjoying the same fame as Windows. \n Well, I believe that the OS like Linux mint- that are more beginners-friendly- will start to get pushed ahead. Companies and people will start developing OS that reassembles Windows in beginner friendliness. Eventually, I believe Linux will just become what Windows is today. People will not have to run commands in order to install stuff. Every app will support Linux natively. Sure, on the more deeper level, many things will surely change. But for an everyday user, I believe it will become so beginner friendly that they won't be able to tell windows and Linux apart.\n Of course, more for-tech-savvy OS would enjoy this surge of people but in proportion, not much.

          "description": "A bit of context: I’ve been “programming” (let’s call it that, even if it’s just changing variable values) since I was a kid. I’ve always liked doing things my way, that is, taking something that already works and modifying it to my liking. I’ve been using Linux for about 7 years, trying out many distributions. At first, I obviously didn’t really understand what it was, so I saw it as “a different system from Windows that runs on my old laptop without any problems.” However, since I’ve always liked computing (I currently study Computer Science), I decided to gradually learn how this “Linux” thing works.\n It all really started one day when I damaged my PC’s motherboard while trying to update the BIOS (I’ve learned from my mistakes). Since I needed a computer, I had to resort to an old office PC that couldn’t run any games and where Windows was too slow. So, I decided to really try and experiment with Linux.\n Since that day, I fell into a rabbit hole that led me to where I am today. For almost 2 years now, I’ve been using Arch Linux (i use arch btw moment) as my daily distribution and OS, and I can say that I simply enjoy Linux. \n I have a group of friends at university who also use Linux, and it’s curious how, almost unanimously, they use Linux but don’t like tinkering with the system much. They find the idea of spending weeks tweaking configurations to center a bar and add a certain animation boring, but I really enjoy it. I spend hours modifying dotfiles to make the system look the way I want and creating scripts to automate any repetitive task. It’s simply a fun activity for me.\n I really just wanted to share this feeling, as I’ve recently realized how much fun I have simply making my system work the way I want.\n    submitted by    /u/Druxorey  \n [link]   [comments]",

Here's a very simple scenario suggesting the exact opposite:\n 1- Newcomer installs Linux\n 2- They open the GUI app store - that is most likely defaulting to flatpak - and install Steam\n 3- They try to add their existing external drive as a Steam library\n 4- They can't because sandbox\n Installing Steam and adding your existing library to it is the first thing a vast, vast majority of people they do on a newly installed system. It is not at all a good first impression that the first thing you do on Linux silently fails. No error messages, no indication why you can't add your drive.\n Most people don't know what's a flatpak, they don't know what's a sandbox, at this point they can't even Google for solutions because they don't know what's wrong. They have to:\n  \nFigure out Steam is installed as a Flatpak\n That Flatpak sandboxes applications\n That they need to punch a hole in the sandbox\n How to do that\n  \nall to just do something that's seemingly so simple.\n If you have spent any amount of time in Windows forums, I think you'll agree that most people won't be able to or be willing to Google their way out this issue. As a result, we get a flood of posts asking for help in irrelevant Linux communities.\n Unless Flatpaks are completely integrated in the desktop environment, e.g. you get a popup that asks if you want to allow Steam to access that drive when you try to add it, there's no way they're a good default distribution method.\n    submitted by    /u/Prestigious-Text9674  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hello everyone,\n I’ve spent the last two weeks testing my new Chipolo One Point tracker with Google’s new Find My Device feature. I placed the tracker in my car, which was parked in a long-term parking lot at the airport. I was eager to see how often the tracker would be detected. I reported the tracker as missing in Find My Device and waited for a notification that it had been located. Well, I waited the full two weeks, and the tracker was only detected when I was back at my car. \n It was only after this that I researched why the tracker hadn’t been detected even once. It turns out that in the Google settings, the owner of each individual phone must manually enable the option to find trackers and other Find My Device devices. By default, trackers are only found in highly frequented areas, where multiple devices detect the tracker simultaneously.\n The parking lot where my car was parked is visited by a relatively large number of people—most of the parking spaces were booked. Yet, my tracker was not detected even once.\n I wish I had placed an AirTag for comparison. I’m sure the AirTag would have been detected at least once, if not several times.\n I really thought the new Chipolo trackers would be a viable alternative to Apple AirTags.\n Unfortunately, Android trackers are useless to me in this regard.\n    submitted by    /u/Komplexkonjugiert  \n [link]   [comments]",

I totally get this on other devices like desktops and laptops, but I feel out of the loop regarding cell phones.\n I use a pixel which are notoriously \"underpowered\". And while the phone does have issues, I don't know that having faster CPUs would fix those issues. Better efficiency and an improved modem would be nice, but I don't game on my phone. To me, it feels like faster phones are already offering diminishing returns compared to the speed boosts the latest processor used to give you. \n Am I missing something about faster processors these days?

Thats when I got introduced to this brand with the Redmi Note 9 Pro which I bought lightly used 2.5 years ago for 140$. I was shocked to see that what I did on my 1400$ iPhone actually felt easier on Android even on a cheap phone with low specs. There some huge gaps in terms of camera and snappiness of course but the experience was still a 7.5/10 which for the price difference blew my mind and in fact some features on Android were plain impossible on iOS (custom video players, access to useful open source apps etc.) My previous experience with Android was way back in the day were I bought a Samsung No…",

          "description": "I got a new Samsung phone recently and the default messaging app was Google messages surprisingly. I used it for awhile, enjoying the new features. But then I found out I can't select text in a text message? Fucking what? Turns out this has been an issue for pixel enjoyers for a long time. Being able to select text in a text message is basic MVP functionality, and Google still hasn't implemented it. \n Thank God for android and being able to switch messaging apps. I'd be losing my fucking mind otherwise lol. \n Samsung messages also allows you to create folders, which is so handy for separating spam/auto messages from important numbers. It's also just nicer to look at IMO.\n Anyways, android is the best. Thank you for coming to my TED talk. \n    submitted by    /u/CommunismDoesntWork  \n [link]   [comments]",

Every time an AI based device is announced there's always the same argument; \"This could've been just an app\"\n I feel like new phone releases, specially this year don't bring anything (apart from a slight redesign of the hardware) really new that is not based on software. Software that really should be fine running on 3rd gen old flagships. Before we would get huge improvements on battery, camera, charging speed, screen, etc. Now is just \"ai this\" and \"generate that\"; oh and also \"now its $100-$200 more\"\n I've seen the last Samsung and now the Google event and I don't see anything that would make me want to spend any money to get some features that should be able to get on my current phone (even if I don't care for them).\n This years new phones specially the ones from Samsung and Google (and most likely Apple later on) makes me say \"This could've just been a software update\"\n    submitted by    /u/lugo3  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hey everyone, while learning about Apple and Android ecosystems, I've noticed a lot of people talking about AirDrop as if it's some kind of magical feature, or how amazing it is to use a Windows computer with a Samsung phone. Well, let me tell you: Good morning! I've been using Linux for at least 6 years now and my Pixel 4 (which, according to a friend, is faster than a 14 Max) for almost 5.\n KDE Connect is an application developed for the KDE Desktop Environment on Linux, but it works on any Linux distribution, even with GNOME (in fact, it's almost better integrated). It also has a respective app for Android (I don't know about iOS but I don't think so).\n You can do everything with it: control your PC in real time, using the keyboard, scrolling, mouse input with a double tap to click, etc., send files using your home Wi-Fi very easily (from PC: right-click -> send to device name, from phone: share -> KDE conn. -> send to name), execute any terminal command from your phone, which allows you to do whatever you want with your phone (I use it to lock my PC, turn it off), and you'll also have simultaneous notifications, a shared clipboard (both incoming and outgoing or as you prefer) and a lot of other really cool things that I invite you to try.\n I wanted to tell you about this because big companies are selling what a group of developers created a few years ago, and they did it better and for free.\n Download KDE Connect and you'll see that's all you need to have an ecosystem between devices, so much so that even my Apple fan friends were speechless.\n    submitted by    /u/SushoFusho  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "今天下午，一朋友在某群 at 我，神秘兮兮的说道要考我一个问题。题目是这样的：\n在 Java 中有 Father 和 Son 类，其中 Son 继承了 Father 类，两类均有 method 方法，现在 Main 类的 main 方法有如下调用：\nFather f = new Son();\nf.method();\n\n问题是，编译此代码，完成后删除 Son.class，请问代码会报错吗？\n我嗤之以鼻，这还用问吗？我甚至可以告诉你这个代码会报的错一定是 NoClassDefFoundError，这也太简单了你拿这个来考我 balabala...\n然而朋友鬼魅一笑（？），你别急啊，题还没出完呢：\n在上述代码的基础上，加入一个 flag justFalse，并环绕到上述代码中：\n// in Main.java\nstatic boolean justFalse = false;\n\n// in Main#main method\nif (justFalse) {\n\tFather f = new Son();\n\tf.method();\n}\n\n同样编译后删除 Son.class，请问代码还还会报错吗？\n我大笑（？）道，这还用问？justFalse 永远是 false，也就是说内部代码永远不可能执行到，那么 Son 类也就永远不可能进入初始化阶段，所以这个代码肯定就不会报错了，这也太简单了你拿这个来考我 balabala...\n然后朋友发来的一张图让我沉默了：\n\n竟然真的会报错，难道 JVM 虚拟机会提前解析并未执行的代码行中包含的类引用吗？不对啊，这和我以前的实践完全不一样，怎么会这样...... 就在我陷入自我怀疑的时候，下一题来了：\n在上述代码的基础上，如果把 Father f = new Son(); 修改为 Son f = new Son();，在同样的操作下，请问代码还还会报错吗？\n我小心翼翼地问道：不会这样它就不会报错了吧...\n朋友淡淡说道：正是。\n我的脑海中此时一万匹草泥马奔驰而过，各种名词在我的大脑中穿过：类加载、静态分派、运行时多态、分支预测... 但没有一个能解释这个诡异的现象。\n我的天塌了。 \n深入了解 JVM 类加载机制\n当说到 JVM 的类加载机制，很多人可能会脱口而出：加载、验证、准备、解析、初始化。如果你接着问他，他可能还会告诉你，解析这个阶段在某些情况下可以在初始化阶段之后开始，这被 JVM 虚拟机称为“惰性解析（\"lazy\" or \"late\" resolution ）”。那么，出现上述情况的原因可能是因为惰性解析被提前了吗？\n然而答案是否定的，在任何情况下，对于一个类，无论其静态分派的类型是什么，其解析都会延迟进行。（即使在 JVM specs 中这种行为是未定义的，虚拟机实现可以选择立刻解析或是延迟解析）\n那么问题出在哪里了呢？经过一番查证，我发现这个报错其实是在 JVM 类加载的验证阶段产生的。\n注意，这里说的不是验证 Son.class 或是 Father.class，而是 Main.class。如果你仔细观察上面给出的堆栈轨迹（在 Oracle JDK 1.8, Hotspot VM 下），其中有一段就是 sun.launcher.LauncherHelper.checkAndLoadMain(LauncherHelper.java:632)。\n在类加载阶段，JVM 虚拟机会试图校验一个类的某些部分是否是未被破坏以及符合预期的。在对 Main.class 类的加载过程中，对于 Father f = new Son(); 和 f.method();，产生了一个包含向上类型转换的多态函数调用，对于这种调用，JVM 虚拟机会试图进行校验，这就需要加载 Son.class 的类结构，而 Son.class 已经被我们删除了，所以产生了报错。\n这种检查需要同时包含 typecast 以及多态函数调用，在上述代码中，无论将变量类型修改为变量的实际类型 Son，亦或者删去对 method 方法的调用，那么也不会产生报错。\n最后，如何验证上述推断是正确的呢？很简单，使用 -noverify 参数关闭 JVM 的类加载校验，你就可以发现上述代码正常运行了。\n（上述代码在 Java 1.8 和 Java 21 的 Hotspot 虚拟机上均能复现。为方便行文，对部分内容有所改编。）",

          "description": "事情起因是这样的。前天的一个帖子里（ https://www.v2ex.com/t/1070885?p=1#reply35 ）大家都表示 AI 对自己的工作无用。我只是有点好奇，为什么我的感觉完全相反？所以想分享一下我的感觉和情况，很好奇大家感觉的没用是什么意义上的没有用（因为不了解专业程序员的工作流程）。\n本人没学过大多数码，但是算法懂。因为工作和研究兴趣需要（ NLP ，很多很冷门的语言），也会经常坐一些很没办法要做的东西。比如分词器，就和 Andrej Karpathy 的网课跟着做，所以其实前一段时间看见他推荐 cursor ，我前天开始也就试着用。然后就觉得 AI 太有用了。我暂时感觉突然摆脱了对程序员的大多数依赖。\n比如，试验阶段就很快用 prompts 做了一个全栈的、机构内部使用的工作记录论坛，感觉很兴奋。因为我之前既不会 java 、也没学过 sql 。就看着看着，debug 的时候，感觉就大概了解了构架、前端后端怎么互动的 blabla ，觉得很不错。我打算马上用现有的经验，写一个网页版的数据库，可以搜集结构化的语料 metadata （就是研究生会看古代语言的、就用这个网页进行标记并且生成结构化的元数据的 database 了，以后 training 时候用）（这样他们做习题就是 labelling slaves 了哈哈）。在之前这是想都不敢想的，肯定会想外包。但即便让专业 coder 做，也会有太多太多需要交流的小细节，比如很多语言是从右到左、从上到下，元音啊各种细节包不包括，乱七八糟的细节，这些调整交流起来会吐血（尤其是 coder 如果完全是技术部门来的），和 cursor 交流就感觉非常好，真的可以一个人把这个想了很久的事情做成。\n再举一个例子，我之前也想过用 OpenAI 的 api 去导出一些专业的语料元数据，但是有一定的格式需求。我大概知道 function calling 和新的 Response format 可以实现，但是因为自己不是专业的，手笨不会做。但程序员一般都只会英语或者欧洲语言，对这些元语料的结构理解需要很多解释（因为现代语言一般语法都很简单），这是去年就一直搁置到现在。昨天突然想起来，半个小时之内就开始用 function calling 自动帮我生成 training data 了。今天打算晚点试试 response format 效果会不会更好。\n所以我会感觉 ai 真厉害，尤其是很多事情可以一个人做了，会比团队快很多。可能有人觉得 AI 不会 debug ，其实不是这样的。第一，这几天 cursor+claudedev 几乎可以解决过程中 60%的错误。即便不能解决，很快要求它们解释哪部分代码是负责的，看懂之后很容易也能修好剩下的问题。（可能对程序员来说，没学过 java 看 java 的代码是荒谬的。但是实际情况是，其实 java 和 python 里也充满了自然语言，大多数问题理解了出在哪里就很容易看见并且修改。一些更高级的概念，比如类的继承啥的，单独看半个小时也基本理解了，虽然具体语句记不住但是可以问 ai 写。更复杂的 transformer 啥的框架确实要另外学懂才会改造，这个 ai 不行。还有， 剩下 40%的几率 ai 即便不能完全 debug 、但可以快速定位是哪些代码，定位速度可能比有经验的眼睛还快）\n是不是专业程序员写的程序都比这些任务要复杂很多，所以 ai 会失效？还是什么别的原因会觉得 ai 鸡肋呢？真心好奇，避争论。",

          "description": "我们公司在某地硬件设备上装了视频监控，目前是上传到云存储桶里，为了节省存储带宽等成本，存的是 h.265 编码格式的视频，但是这样子在浏览器端没法播放\n所以我想了两个方案\n1. 浏览器端找能支持 h265 的播放器 js ，但是基本上找到的都是基于 wasm 的 ffmpeg ，也就是在浏览器端解码，然后通过 canvas 一帧一帧画，然后再用 audio 播放声音。感觉这个方案不是很好，可能会又吃性能又卡，还有可能声音画面不同步。\n2.通过增加中间层服务，使用 ffmpeg+nodejs 进行转码(我不太会其他语言)。尝试了一下如果用 ffmpeg 完全把一个视频转换成 h264 的格式，耗费的时间会很长，有些长视频要半个多小时。\n所以我现在的想法是：\n\t我看浏览器的 video 标签加载视频时，也不是整个视频缓冲完才开始播放呀，metadata 加载到了就可以播放了？而且貌似也是播放一点加载一点，这样是不是可以用 ffmpeg+nodejs 做成实时转码的服务？浏览器端请求一小段，就转一小段，这样子就使得该视频原生支持 video 标签了，也不需要额外的播放器 js 了。同时也能使用 video 标签自带的进度条拖拽进度\n想问下大家我的这个想法是否可行？\n还有个问题，我看到一些方案里写 ffmpeg 转 m3u8 ，然后存一堆 ts 文件，浏览器端再用某个 js 播放库去播放，这样存储成本是不是又上来了？外加转码服务的服务器成本，搞不好还不如一开始直接存 h264 格式？\nffmpeg+nodejs 有没有可能做到实时转码成原生 video 支持的格式，对于浏览器端来说属于无感知的转码那种的，不需要存文件，直接返回流给前端",

          "description": "本文作者没有一步登天，也没有怀揣 200 个 w ，更不会装 b ，请放心阅读。\n昨天躺在床上玩手机，突然一想，是不是已经来上海 8 年了？\n2017 年 7 月份的那个夜晚，我从苏州的泰南苑出发，当时的行李很简单，就一个书包和行李箱，坐着和谐号列车，深夜到的上海。\n这个箱子还是我刚上大学那会买的，很重，但很大，我有点担心它挡住过道上别人来来往往，就想把它抗到头顶的行李架上，但是试了好几次都失败了，太重了，每次抗到腰这个位置就被迫放下了。旁边坐着的人肯定都觉得我很奇怪吧，他也太自不量力了，是不是农村来的土狗？\n我不是第一次来上海，以前上大学时，每次都要来上海中转，一般都是晚上的车，所以下午我都会找个地方逛一下，一个人在这个城市里走一走。每次闲逛时，总会被上海的摩天大楼震撼到，这里的路怎么这么宽敞啊，这里的大楼怎么会这么高啊，马上就会有一种自卑感，有一种渺小的感觉。这种感觉留在我的心里很久很久，以至于工作后很久我都不敢来上海，觉得自己太菜了，不配来上海。\n真正让我动心来上海的是，有个同学在上海工作很轻松，都是做程序员，他朝九晚五的，不用加班，我每天还要加班到 9 点多，关键工资是我的两倍多，这让我瞬间有些不服气了，大家水平都差不多，凭什么待遇差这么多啊？\n刚来上海的时候，其实挺不顺利的，不仅是工作，还有生活。\n我记得第一次租房子就租到了群租房，是一个客厅改装成的小房间，当时心里还美滋滋，1500 ，在上海一个高档的小区租到了房子，还挺能耐。同时也是自己第一次在外面租房，感觉还挺自由，再也没有人管我了，想几点睡就几点睡，同时对于我这种 i 人，也不用跟别人社交了，回家就算在家里静静发呆也挺好。\n可是好景不长，一天早上，一阵急促的敲门声把我吵醒，打开门，一群叔叔带着一群农民工直接走进来。还没等我开口问叔叔什么事，那群拿着大锤子的工人直接把锤子抡向木板隔成的墙，大锤 80,80,80 ，那临时拼凑成的木板墙怎么会经受的住这种猛烈的撞击，三两下就都倒塌了，倒向了我的房间，我的床，我的房间就裸露在外了，他们砸完什么都没说，就走了，临走前还把电给断了。\n这个社会不会直接跟你说这个是对的，那个不能做，只是在你做了一件事情后，给你后果，不管是好的后果，还是坏的后果，推着你继续往前走。\n现在大家都说行情不太好，前几年是互联网的黄金时代，随便一个人，包装一下简历就能找到好几个 w 月薪的工作，看到很多短视频还在说，2018 年是最好的一年，值得怀念，可是对于我来说，2018 年真的没有想象中那么好，2018 年我工资就只有几 k,天天还各种加班，被老板 pua,怀疑是自己的问题，严重的拖了大家的后腿。\n有种说法是苦难才能成就今天的自己，我并不这么想，我觉得苦难就是人生的一道坎，不管你是积极面对，还是悲观面对，它都是在那里阻拦着你，如果有的选，没人愿意主动去吃苦。\n没有耀眼的学历，没有显赫的背景，在大城市里单打独斗，随着时间的流走，身上吃饭的技能总会比当初更加成熟，比当初的自己更厉害了，但是个人的成长永远都赶不上时代的潮流的。我已经忘记了当初选择来上海的豪言壮语，但我想肯定不是说为了找一份糊口的工作吧。\n一个资质平庸，能力平庸的人在深夜胡言乱语。",

          "description": "房子卖掉了，亏了小几万，可以接受，就当买个教训。\n以后都不敢把希望寄托在邻居的素质上了。当然还有新房的质量上了。\n把从买到卖，盘点一下，才发现一路走来，真的一步一坑。\n一 买房\n当时还是限购， 需要摇号。\n我家就一个人有资格，\n摇中后， 两个选择：\n1 付定金 2w 。  2 放弃购买，半年内无资格参与摇号\n当时只有样板间，也没什么好参考的，\n所以除非有特别原因 等同于只能选 1 。\n然后约付首付，又是两个选择\n1 付首付。2 放弃 损失定金。\n所以等同于还是只有一个选择。\n我印象里付完首付，才签的合同，记不太清了。\n当时宣传的是房子当年年底就可以交房，我们也是被这个吸引的。\n实际签合同时，在未有任何通知的情况下，合同上的交房时间比宣传的延期了 7 个月。\n这时候同样两个选择，1 签合同，2 扯皮，大概率亏钱。\n毕竟定金，首付都交了，贼船已经上了。\n所以实际上，等同于还是只有一个选择。\n然后交房时间比合同上的还要延期，实际晚了一年半。\n哦 对了 当时还新实行了一个政策，大意就是不卖毛坯了，卖精装修，合同上装修价格是每平米两千多。\n也是没法反对的。\n还能咋样呢，继续签字呗。\n二 收房\n当时花了两百多，请了个验房师。\n人家倒也算敬业，大大小小便利贴，贴了一屋子。\n什么空鼓，裂缝，锁装反了，比比皆是。\n最搞笑的是，燃气热水器孤零零的挂在那，居然接不到燃气管。\n然后呢 报备到开发商，\n偶尔才有下文。\n有些改了，大部分不了了之。\n同样，业主一点办法都没有。\n看似有选择，实则无选择。\n不收房，房子也是你的，问题也还是存在的，我有邻居三年没收房，里面的门还是没装的。\n只能先住着吧。\n三 住房\n三个字，质量差。\n今天这里坏，明天那里坏。\n电梯不到一年，就频繁的关人，或者维修。\n洗脸池，睡前还好好的，起床发现洗脸池掉地上了。\n有个业主很委屈的在群里说，“你们啥时候来给我修灯啊，我都摸黑半年了”。\n最大的槽点是隔音，极其的差。\n楼上，楼上的楼上，楼下的走路说话唱歌，我都可以听到。\n我的房子里就像恐怖片一样，明明就我一个人，能听到一大家子的声音，\n身临其境。\n有走路的，有放东西的，有大喊的，有跑步的，有关门的，\n此起彼伏，热闹非凡。\n偏偏我楼上素质极差，十岁大的小孩，三年学不会穿拖鞋，大人放任不管。大人七点吵架，摔东西。\n沟通过，讲道理过，吵架过，反击过，甚至想过同归于尽，\n不胜其烦。\n当时还是限售，想卖都卖不掉，我是生生的被折磨了几年。\n最后限售过了，很多原因叠加，决定卖了。\n四 卖房\n现在卖房的情况是，不管你装修，不管你户型，不管你楼层，不管你的任何附加价值，只看小区的近期成交价。\n这肯定是不合理的，\n因为就算你去买猪肉，还得分前腿和五花，不同部位的价格肯定不同。\n所以个人感觉这种情况不会持续太久。\n中介，很不专业，房屋信息都能讲错，只会不停的劝你降价。\n（我的房子挂的价格是很公道的，贝壳评分也很高，并没有挂高价）\n甚至出现过疑似虚假带看的行为。\n有一个很假的客户，他走后我就知道，第二天中介肯定要来报价，果然报价了。\n签约，合同是统一的模板，但感觉对卖方的保障不够到位，\n比如如果因为买家问题，导致贷款批不下来，最后终止合同，默认选项是定金返还。\n这就不合理，要不然要定金干嘛呢。\n如果有卖房的朋友，可以关注下这里。\n卖房流程还有一个坑点，首先每个地方的流程和政策是不一样的，可能我说的，其他地方是不存在的。\n买家拿到新房产证后，需要去抵押，然后银行放款。\n这里的坑点就是，如果买家不去抵押，选择了取消贷款，房子已经过户了，你尾款收不到。\n我不知道其他的地方是怎么保障这一块的。\n我去问过银行，他们说，买家是可以取消贷款的，银行不能阻止，也不会通知卖家。\n我也网上查过，有地方是发生过这种 zha 骗的。\n如果买家确实要买，那就没问题，如果别有用心，就很难说。\n所以我当时还是焦虑了两天，还好收到钱了。\n综上，这就是我从买到卖的经历。\n如果踩几个坑，那也许是我运气不好。\n如果每一步都踩了坑，我想不会全是因为我衰。\n反正经历了这一切，我是不太想买房子了，至少不买新房。\n唉 其实房子卖了，还是有点舍不得的，折磨了我这么久，但我也投入了这么多精力和感情。\n现在无车无房无债，有存款。\n希望开始新的生活。",

          "description": "周围同事认为事假会“扣薪”，所以不到万不得已不会轻易请事假。但在本人的认知里，本来人就没去上班，没有当天的薪资很正常，故即使年假用光了也会经常以小时为单位请事假。（被调侃了下“没有生活压力~”）\n关于这点认知的差异我稍感兴趣。可能是我一直以来都是按时薪去计算薪资，导致观念里认为自己的工作是计时的；但其他人或许不这么认为，他们大概更倾向于固定薪资（？），所以才会有因事假失去了当天的薪资属于被“扣薪”的观念。\n综上，发帖调查统计下其他人的观念。",

          "description": "我家里有一台旧笔记本改装的 NAS （黑裙辉），内网穿透的方案是自己买域名+Cloudflare DNS 解析+DDNS 。\n目前托管了多个容器（基于 Docker ），有 Emby 、Komga 、DDNS 等等，当然也包含最基础的文件访问功能。\n目前是基于 HTTP ，因为 Docker 容器貌似无法 HTTPS 连接（可能是我自己不会弄）。\n每一个容器访问都需要单独的密码（只有我自己可以访问），公网只开放了若干个虚拟端口（路由器转发）关闭 SSL 远程访问功能。\n这套方案已经运行了一年多了，一直很稳定。应该是由于我最近得了焦虑症的原因，我突然对此感到很焦虑。\n原因是我当初选择内网穿透的原因就是方便我在学校连接 NAS 看电影（也可以远程控制 NAS 通过磁力下载电影）。虽然使用包括 Emby 在内的所有容器都需要密码，只有我自己可以访问。但是我还是担心版权问题（害怕收律师函）。\n还有一点要提及的，因为我们家用的旁路由代理，因此 NAS 所有的流量都会经过旁路由进行分流，例如磁力相关会直链，不排除漏网之鱼，Emby 的海报源因为来自于 imdb 所以是走代理。基本上除了特别设置（例如磁力源），都是根据解析网站 IP 或者网址本身来分流的，中国大陆的 IP/网站是直连，日本的 IP/网站走日本节点，台北的 IP/网站走台北节点，小众地区统一走日本节点。\n不知道我的担心是不是有点多余了，想听听看各位大佬，尤其是跟我一样家用 NAS 内网穿透的大佬发表一下自己的看法。\n欢迎友好讨论，请不要阴阳怪气谢谢。因为我目前焦虑症的原因，是真的有可能会因为这些阴阳怪气的言论而感到内耗的。还请大家多包涵，我在这里先谢谢大家了。",

          "description": "立秋了，但还是很热。\n镇上创文明树新风，\n取缔无证小商小贩，\n整治商户门前用地。\n像阿志这种站街揽客卖服务的，\n都被无限期勒令停业。\n阿志没了事做。\n***\n午后，\n在阿宝超市门口，\n树下的长椅上，\n阿志躺了。\n太阳很大，\n但树荫下并不太热。\n微风偶而吹过，\n温温的，很舒服。\n迷迷糊糊中，\n阿志似乎听到了咔嚓声，\n母亲切开冰镇大西瓜，\n自己在小桌前，\n期待着。\n***\n“别翻了！冰糕全都让你给翻坏了！”\n是阿宝的声音。\n阿宝老婆一般不让他来看店，\n因为他老得罪人。\n有一次，\n一个老太太讨价还价，来回了几句，\n阿宝一把夺过老太太手里的东西，\n把人给轰了出去。\n现在阿宝关上了冰柜拉门，\n要赶走面前的大爷。\n大爷稀疏的头发和着汗水粘在头皮上，\n抬头看着阿宝，张开的嘴微颤着，\n说不出话来。\n这时，阿宝老婆回来了。\n“来了何大爷！\n棒棒冰换位置了，\n在里面这个冰柜呢。”\n说着拿出一个棒棒冰递给何大爷，\n何大爷接过，放下几个硬币，\n转身朝树下走来。\n***\n阿志看何大爷来了，\n连忙坐起让出位置。\n“日子没法过了啊！”\n何大爷坐下，叹了一口气，\n把棒棒冰一掰两节，\n递给阿志一半：\n“太凉了，我一个人吃不完。”\n阿志没说话，接了过来。\n“日子真是没法过了啊！”\n何大爷又说了一遍。\n“是啊～”\n阿志应了一句。\n何大爷就接受了邀请，开始了倾诉。\n***\n年初，何大爷死了老婆。\n“活着的时候，总吵架，\n这死了，连吵架的人都没有了。”\n“跟你吵架，都是因为在乎你，\n不在乎的，都不会搭理你。”\n“女儿没用，早晚都要嫁出去，\n不嫁出去也没时间应付我这老头子。”\n“人老了，就招人嫌。”\n“她要是嫁出去，我也就不再操心了。”\n“都三十好几了，还能嫁出去吗？”\n何老头停下来，看着阿志。\n阿志低头，\n嗦着棒棒冰，思考着，\n不知道这是个疑问句还是反问句。\n何老头没等到阿志回答，\n继续唠叨了下去。\n棒棒冰吃完了，\n何老头在裤子上抹了抹手，说：\n“要不……你给我推个头吧？”\n***\n吃人嘴软，阿志就答应了。\n外边不让摆摊，\n何老头就说去他家推，\n推完刚好方便洗一下。\n推完，\n何老头去洗，\n阿志说要走。\n何老头从洗手间里顶着湿头发跑出来，\n抓住阿志的手说：\n“不走不走！吃个瓜再走！吃个瓜再走！”\n阿志说不了不了，何老头急得跺脚：\n“瓜太大！我一个人吃不完！切开了就要坏！”\n阿志就留下了。\n吃完瓜，\n何老头又要了阿志手机号，\n说自己的手机两星期没响了，\n以前还有推销电话，现在连推销的也没了。\n“那你女儿呢？”\n阿志说完，就觉得自己多了嘴。\n何老头长叹一口气：\n“不知道。”\n“那你没问问？”\n可能是觉得吃了别人的瓜，\n多少要说两句，阿志就又多了一嘴。\n“一年回来一次，死了给你下葬，\n就不错了，别想太多。”\n“问一问嘛，万一有什么事呢？”\n***\n最后还是问了。\n何老头拔了电话，开着免提，\n嘟到第五声，终于接通了。\n“爸？！怎么给我打电话了？！有事么？！”\n“啊……”\n“你现在在家么？！出什么事情了么？！”\n“在家，没事……”\n“那挂了啊～我正搬着东西呢！”\n嘟一下，电话就挂了。\n阿志不知道该说什么，\n屋里一片沉默。\n何老头把手机咣当扔到一边：\n“看，还没死就不能给女儿打电话！”\n这时，咚咚咚门响了。\n“开门！”\n是一个女人的声音。\n何老头噌一下从椅子上站起来，看着门口。\n“爸！快开门！东西拿不住了！”\n阿志冲过去，打开了门。\n***\n门外，是何老头的女儿。\n“你这个时候回来干什么？！”\n何老头又气又喜又不愿人看出来，\n一边说着气话一边从女儿手里接过东西，\n“西瓜都吃完了，早说就给你留一些！”\n“不用！我带了！”\n说着，何老头女儿转身抱进来一个大西瓜。\n阿志要走，\n父女俩实在热情，\n把阿志按在了椅子上，\n一定要留他吃晚饭。\n饭后，喝茶闲聊。\n何老头问阿志，\n三十多岁单身又没病，\n怎么就没想着找个老婆？\n阿志放下茶碗，犹豫了一下，\n讲起了自己从来没讲过的事。\n***\n三年前，有突变病毒时，\n阿志和女朋友准备领证，\n女朋友回父母家拿户口本。\n女朋友刚下车，\n病毒爆发，全城静默。\n被判为密接，立即隔离，\n凌晨被装上了转运大巴。\n然后就出了车祸。\n再也没能回来。\n阿志发了疯，打了人，\n被关进去了几个月。\n出来后，\n没了工作，也没了爱人，\n想着不如回家照顾父母，\n就回来了。\n刚到家，管控放开，\n所有人都得上了那个病。\n刚开始那两天，\n买不到药，只能硬扛。\n扛过去的人里，\n没有阿志的父母。\n***\n“日子过着没意思，\n没想过会干起快推。”\n阿志笑了笑，端起了茶碗。\n又坐了一会儿，阿志告辞，\n何老头女儿出门送客。\n“谢谢你来给我爸理发。”\n阿志想说：“不用谢，收了钱的”，\n忽然想起，收钱的事，又忘记了。\n***\n太阳落山了，\n天空是很深很深的蓝色，\n隐约有几颗星星在闪。\n一阵温热的夜风吹来，\n夹着一丝凉爽。\n这灼人的夏天，\n似乎真的要结束了。",

          "description": "之前写前端比较多，最近开始用 Spring boot 开发 api\n使用的是 JPA Hibernate orm+jdk21 方案，我不知道为什么感觉国内很多人不喜欢这个 Hibernate ，但是我自己用下来感觉非常好，它最牛逼的是可以按照 Entity 生成数据库结构，非常智能，所以你只要把实体定义好，一切都 ok 了，很容易维护。\n有个插件 JPA buddy ，非常好用，可以很好规范代码。\nJPA 也可以自定义 sql ，很灵活，除了在转成 json 的时候，会遇到无限循环的问题，其他感觉都很好。\n感觉 Spring boot 写后端，除了 JAVA 本身有点啰嗦，还有编译很浪费时间，其他都还蛮不错的。\n但是 JPA 通过 Entity 生成数据库的时候，为什么字段顺序和 Entity 是不一样的，是打乱的，，id 的位置会随机出现~~我槽，这就像要喝汤的时候飞进了一个苍蝇，我看网上有很多人说要 hack 一下，官方无解，但这个太离谱了。\n然后就是 CommandLineRunner ，我本来的需求是需要给项目 seed 一点初始化数据，这个 CommandLineRunner 只在启动的时候自动执行，不能通过 cli 命令执行，，泥马这个 CommandLineRunner 和 Command 一点关系都没有啊，我内个去，所以 seed 数据只能在 CommandLineRunner 加 if 条件。你去看人家 PHP laravel 都有 artisan cil 工具啊，这个可是天天都要用的，为啥你没有啊~~~你 Tomcat 都可以监听指令，为啥就不做一个监听 命令行指令的。\n后来我看了一个 spring boot cli 的插件，结果完全不是这个概念。。\n为什么这么成熟的框架连这些基本都做不好啊谁可以告诉我一下\n然后我现在在看 liquidbase 和 flyway ，还是 flyway 吧，直接 sql 多优雅，liquidbase 那个语法不能忍受~~\n谁能告诉我怎么才能优雅的搞后端呢？",

          "description": "《国产编程语言蓝皮书-2024 》作为该系列的第二版，根据前一版的经验和反馈，对编制方案进行了以下优化：\n增加了英文版，以扩大国际影响力，中英文版本将同步发布，内容保持一致；\n在项目申报资料中，为项目简介部分提供了建议内容清单，以促进项目展示的标准化；\n延长了项目申报的时间，给予申报者更多的准备时间，直至 2024 年 10 月底。\n编程语言是软件业的工业母机、编译器技术是信息产业的根技术，各种编程语言被用于操作系统、数据库管理系统、网络服务、工控设备、应用程序等的开发，渗透到了所有现代产业和服务领域。尤其是信息产业创新空间的持续扩展、系统复杂度的持续上升、开发成本的持续降低，都直接受益于不断涌现的编程语言和编译技术。\n迄今为止，国内几乎没有出现被广泛使用的编程语言，这与我国世界性工业大国、科技大国的地位相去甚远。\n国家政策层面，工业和信息化部发布的《“十四五”软件和信息技术服务业发展规划》中提到，应“强化基础组件供给……加快突破编程语言开发框架”；中国软件行业协会发布的《中国软件根技术发展白皮书（基础软件册）》第四章专门对编程语言和编译器的重要性、发展态势等进行了归纳。\n这些政策文件的发布，为编程语言产业的发展提供了坚实的支持。随着信息技术的多年积累，我国已经形成了一个庞大的产业群体，对编程语言这一基础工具的需求日益增长。特别是在大语言模型、国产芯片等新兴技术领域的快速发展，对编程语言提出了更多新的需求。\n回顾历史不难发现，与其他产业不同，作为信息产业的核心，编程语言的成功案例充满了偶然性。目前广泛使用的编程语言和开发工具，它们可能源自大型企业的商业推动，也可能源自个人或开源社区的创新。国内根软件行业呈现出项目高度分散化的趋势，企业和社区正在积极推动各种类型的编程语言项目，以满足不同领域的需求。\n随着国家对软件和信息技术服务业的重视，以及对基础软件的大力支持，国产编程语言的发展迎来了前所未有的机遇。《国产编程语言蓝皮书-2024 》的编制，正是响应国家政策，汇聚国内编程语言创新力量的重要举措。\n鉴于此，编程语言开放社区（ PLOC ）推出的《国产编程语言蓝皮书》，旨在全面收录并定期更新国内活跃且具有一定可用性的编程语言项目，为行业提供一个全面的国产编程语言概览。\n2023 版蓝皮书地址: https://www.ploc.org.cn/ploc/CNPL-2023.pdf\n原文: https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/8ZJXPSQZlAOZoEYUkzGQfA",

          "description": "这已经是第三次参加亚宠展了，它的全称是亚洲宠物展，展会涉及到各大厂商的粮食，零食，玩具，衣服，家具，洗护用品等等，一切你想到的和想不到的关于宠物的东西在这里都能找到 。\n记得几年前买家里的那只蓝猫时，原来猫主人就说等到了每年的亚宠展，就会带我们去薅羊毛，可以领到的东西非常的多，带个行李箱过去都会塞的满满当当的。\n现场很火爆\n去年参加了一次，今天参加了一次它博会，再加上这一次，全程下来，感觉很累很累，几千家的店铺分别在 W 系列馆，E 系列馆，N 系列馆，这所有的馆都走一遍，腿就已经酸的不行了，何况是每个馆都分布了几百家商铺，来来回回的兜圈。\n像那种大型的宠物商家，如渴望，巅峰这种，是热门中的大热门，需要很早很早就来会场抢，我们 9 点多过去就已经晚了，而这几次的疯狂小狗，弗列加特，蓝氏等等，由于商家送的东西很多，所以就吸引了很多人过来排队打卡。有时候活动还没有开始，门口就排了很长很长的队伍，看着现场很拥挤，很吓人，但是活动是很有秩序的，派发的也很多快，所以队伍流通的也很快。\n活动参与方式\n大部分商家的活动形式就是关注，关注小红书账号，关注抖音账号，关注淘宝账号就可以，有一些商家会让发一些小红书的笔记，笔记中带有商家的话题或者是亚宠展的话题，还有一些是我比较喜欢的形式，就是做游戏，商家会在现场准备游戏场地，比如套圈，丢沙包，像今年有一些新的游戏形式如愤怒的小鸟弹弓，砸铁锤等等。本来大家都比较疲惫，有时候排队时间比较长，通过这种游戏与运气的方式，能够有效的环节疲劳，增加趣味性。\n能薅到哪些羊毛\n取决于商家的类型，像卖食品的一边都会送一些猫粮，狗粮的试用装，或者是猫条，冻干，湿粮等等，而像一些洗护用品会送一些除臭剂，洗护剂，一些药品公司会送一些驱虫的试用装。一些装饰公司送了一些猫猫狗狗用的喝水的折叠碗或者是类似于子弹头的便携袋子。现场最不缺的就是各种袋子了，就是印有自己商标的各种大的购物袋。\n哪些人能参加\n这个展每年都会举办一次，一般都是举办 4,5 天，前 3 天都是面向商家或者是专业观众的，后两天是面对消费者的。所谓的专业观众就是有猫猫狗狗的宠物店店主等，我理解的前面三天都是商家谈合作的，对于我们这种普通的猫猫狗狗的家长来说，一般就选在周六周天去。\n除了薅羊毛还能干啥\n有些人可能说，对于那些试用装我没有兴趣，我有钱，想买就直接买了，为什么要浪费时间去薅羊毛？其实，去参加这个展会，也是开阔自己眼界的一个方式，像去年认识了疯狂小狗这个品牌，从此就一直关注了它，发现它一直在举办各种宠物的活动，有时候有空了就会带宠物参加。\n其次，现场也会有这种优质的宠物宝宝们，不仅有猫猫，狗狗，也会有各种比较小众的宠物，如安哥拉兔子，仓鼠，乌龟，蜥蜴，蛇等，看似小众，这些展位往往人山人海，大家都有猎奇的心理。比如说养蛇，你平时会比较会很少见到，但是在这个展会上你会见到来自全国各地来的宠物爱好者。\n不过今年参加下来，明显感觉冷淡了很多，不仅能耗到的羊毛少了，而且周六去的，发现有些小场地商家已经开始撤场了，有的在做清仓大甩卖，也不难理解，商家们大老远的运这些产品来上海，也不想再付一笔运费又把它们运回去。",

          "description": "好啦好啦我知道已经有很多类似的帖子了（今天早上 Google 了「 site:v2ex.com 女朋友生日送什么好」了以后浏览完了 57 篇帖子···）但是不同时间提问 回答的人会不同嘛\n女朋友下周就要 28 岁了（划掉，18 岁），爱好一下子能想到的有：玩游戏（端游）、“她说蓝色是她最爱的颜色”、玉桂狗、荔枝（水果）\nℹ️几个她最近提过的点：\n❶久坐腰不舒服——但这也是我的困惑 而我自己都一直没能发现什么好的解决方法（除了不久坐）\n❷在某一个晚上突然提过想要去拍一套什么写真，但这个还得确认她到底要不要去拍，如果真的要去拍或许可以当成礼物？\n❸还提过想要下次见面的时候点香薰（所以需要买香薰），但这个因为要一起享用所以应该不能算作单方面的礼物叭···\n过去送给过她的礼物：一个蓝色的 Xbox 无线手柄（后来才知道她自己已经有一个有线的 Xbox 手柄了···）、玉桂狗的内衣、蓝色的围巾、手写贺卡\n她送给过我的礼物：加盖她唇印的手写贺卡、她自己、潘多拉的对戒（当时因为样式我没有很喜欢所以···没有要）、LV 的手链（太贵重了！所以也没有要）、书包钱包等等她想给我买但是我也没有要，因为感觉不是很需要耶\n所以她应该不需要很“贵重”的礼物，她自己的一个发卡都要两千多欧（实际上她说我送什么她都喜欢，从之前送过的礼物来看确实是这样）\n🙂‍↔️这次生日「不太考虑」送的礼物及原因：\n❶香水：因为想要送给她的香水(Jo by Jo Loves)希望她当场闻过喜欢后再买给她\n❷拍立得：因为有计划明年年底前去日本迪士尼，所以打算之后去日本旅游的时候再买（疑似🫓我知道）\n❸酒水：57 篇帖子里有人提到过送酒水其实我也不太知道为什么···女朋友不跟我在一起的时候其实不喝酒，所以即便考虑到女朋友喜欢荔枝可以考虑荔枝酒，但这应该也会因为只有跟我在一起的时候才喝从而没办法算作单方面的礼物吧···（类似香薰）\n❹ Watch：理由类似香水，虽然因为女朋友月经不是很准，确实希望她可以利用手表来预测排卵期（已经确认她习惯戴表），但即便这样也需要她当场试戴确定了喜欢的样式以后才能买，而且我自己也想换新了，所以在等比较值得买的一代（顺便等我工作了就可以用自己的工资给她买了）\n❺双人游：感觉我目前不太有 cover 掉全程全款的能力（虽然有意向目的地 但是单单双人双程机票就要£550 呜呜呜）\n❻闪现：有考虑过下周直接飞过去，但是她会加班，所以就只能还是视频了···\n❼清空购物车：感觉她不是很需要我给她花钱···",

          "description": "背景\n女朋友是今年的应届生，普通本科 视觉传达设计专业，父母在北京这边做点小生意，我也在北京，所以她实习就在北京，工作也在这儿找。\n水平在我看来是挺不错的，不管是平时那些设计作业，还是最后的毕业设计，我看了都觉得眼前一亮，在她们专业成绩也一直是第一名。\n知道这个学历和专业实在算不上好，所以预期并不高，大厂只是投一下简历凑个热闹，主要还是在找小公司 10k 以下的设计类工作，没想到这种要求了，还这么难。\n主要经过\n3-5 月\n在一家在线教育公司的平面设计岗实习，公司比较大，也比较规范，虽然钱不多，她干得挺开心，领导们评价也不错。5 月底回校准备毕业展的时候，跟领导确认无法转正，没有坑位，很洒脱地就辞了，想着毕业之后再找。结果，这一找，就找到了现在。\n6 月至今\n6 月份的时候我没怎么问，她自己也想先玩几天，有一搭没一搭地投简历，自然是没什么结果。进入 7 月份，她就有点急了，本来投的还都是上家公司那种规模的（ 1000+），无果后开始投各种小公司，结果还是没回音。\n我们俩商量，不行了，得换策略。\n不局限于文化行业了，各种行业的，但凡是个设计岗，都投。\n大部分岗位动辄要求两三年工作经验，所以现在就不在乎薪资了，只要能入职，工资低无所谓，积攒点工作经验以后再跳。\n有效果，陆续开始收到面试了，大多都是 10-50 个人的公司，给的薪资也都是 5-6K 。陆陆续续参加了十几次面试，结果，竟然一个都没能找到。我给大家挑几个典型的说一下：\n几个典型\n新型书店：早 10 晚 7 、偶尔出差、双休、五险一金、7K\n这是最想去的一个，公司实际上是个 书店+咖啡店+会场服务 的模式。排除掉服务员厨师什么的，算上老板一共就不到十个人。\n第一轮面试的时候，跟面试官聊得很好，面试官都让准备好入职手续了，说问下老板意见，应该没有大问题，结果老板要求加一轮面试。\n老板的那场面试，女朋友说全程没捞着说话，老板从工作内容讲到国家经济发展形势，又讲到人生哲理和对年轻人的殷切嘱托，然后就结束了，可以走了。\n第一轮的面试官说，老板有些其他顾虑，但是她本人非常认可，所以她会帮忙再争取下。然后，就没信了。\n打印店：早 8 晚 8 、单休、五险、7K\n说是某某文化公司，实际上是个大一点的打印店，所以会接一点帮小公司做点宣传册的设计工作。在招聘软件上确认了上述条件后，去现场面试了。\n出来面试的是打印店老板，对上述谈好的条件都不清楚，从头开始谈。PUA 一番后说工资 6K ，女友表示接受之后他突然说，刚才看错了，以为是有两年经验，没想到是个刚毕业的，那 6K 就不行了，只能给 4K 。再次表示接受之后，又说，工作时间不固定，只要店里有顾客就不能下班，五险一金统统没有，说团队培养新人也要成本云云。\n能看出来，人家就是不想要，所以也没有再纠缠。\n传媒公司&电玩城：早 11 晚 10 、月休 4 天、五险、5K\n老板有个电玩城，还有个传媒公司。所以去了之后既要给电玩城设计优惠券宣传图，还要给传媒公司设计些海报。从这个工作时间也能看出来还得兼电玩城服务人员。\n去面试，一开始，老板和副总就架个手机在那儿拍我对象。自我介绍完了之后，一边调整手机一边让重新说一遍，拍完之后两个人就走了，剩个戴眼镜的男的面试。问了包含星座血型 MBTI 等各种信息，让我对象详细介绍了自己的家庭情况和人生经历，然后开始点评。对象一边哭一边跟我复述他那些油腻到让人不适的发言，我都能想象这个老男人是用什么样的眼神打量眼前的年轻女孩。\n我的感受\n不找了，找个屁，这些狗屎工作工资还没我的零头高。我知道这是社会中的大多数，我也不是想抱怨，我只是觉得，我实在没必要让我对象吃这样的苦。她在家爱干啥干啥，网上接单作图一个月也能赚两三千了。\n但是她接受不了。\n好歹也是个本科生，她想不通为什么找个本专业的工作这么难，也接受不了自己只能做这样的工作。我想劝劝她，可最后也只能长叹一声，咋办呢？各位老哥？",

          "description": "先介绍下背景，坐标欧洲，家宽是墙上 RJ45 网口直接 DHCP 获取公网静态 IPv4 ，无 IPv6 ，这个 IPv4 似乎是跟着 MAC 地址的，只要 MAC 地址不变，这个公网 IPv4 就不变。平时插着一个小米路由器来用。\n然后我有台旧的 ThinkPad ，运行 Win10 ，Windows Update 一直开着的，平时一直都会更新到最新版。很多年了一直 24 小时运行，当个服务器用，平时跑些东西，没跑 HTTP ，也有在路由器上映射一些端口方便公网直接访问，主要是 3389 和 SSH （ Windows 自带的 OpenSSH ），当然在公网上的端口不是 3389 和 22 ，不过现在这似乎并不重要，人家都是直接扫服务的。还有一些其它端口是做 Tailscale 的跳板，也就是把我的 Tailscale 其它一些设备的一些端口通过这台 ThinkPad 跳到公网上，方便在外面不需要通过 Tailscale 来直接访问我的 Tailscale 网络中的一些设备。直接用的是 Windows 的 portproxy 。\n很多年了一直很稳定，这 ThinkPad 从来没死过机，没出过问题，平时基本就在旁边吃灰。\n然后今年 6 月 24 日我回国休假，记得 6 月 25 日我还在国内试着连了下这 ThinkPad 的 3389 ，看看速度啊啥的，也没用来干啥事。然后 26 号以后就连不上了，Tailscale 也显示这台机子离线。当时我也没管，因为想着可能死机了或者网崩了啥的，无所谓了到时回去了再看看怎么回事。\n然后今天刚回到欧洲，诡异的事情来了！！！！！\n第一件事是先发现 WIFI 上不了网，手机能连上小米路由器 WIFI ，但是无网络，登后台页面说 DHCP 无响应。以为路由器出了什么幺蛾子，第一时间重启路由器嘛，还是不行。\n然后看了下 ThinkPad ，发现 ThinkPad 死机了，按大小写灯不亮，屏幕也不亮，先没管，想着先去弄好网络先，看看网络怎么回事\n插拔了几次网线/重启路由都提示 DHCP 无响应，于是试试直接把网线插电脑上，但是网线插我电脑上又能获取到 IP 能正常上网，第一反应是路由器 WAN 口的 MAC 地址被运营商封了？然后路由器 WAN 口改个 MAC 地址，马上能获取 DHCP 能上网了，但是没过几秒又断网了，然后 DHCP 又获取不到地址了，像是被秒封了（划重点！）。\n这时无意间看到 ThinkPad 连着的交换机灯在狂闪（ ThinkPad 通过一个千兆有线交换机连到小米路由 LAN 口，此时交换机上没有除了 ThinkPad 和小米路由之外的设备），这时还是死机状态，连的显示器不亮，按大小写键盘灯不亮，风扇也不转说明 CPU 不热），于是我长按电源键强行关机重启了下 ThinkPad 。一重启网马上就正常了，小米路由 DHCP 马上有响应，马上能上网，甚至路由 MAC 地址都没改，然后改回路由默认的 WAN 口 MAC 地址也能正常上网正常获取 IP 了，一切都恢复正常了。\n妈也，细思极恐，不知道是不是我的 ThinkPad 被黑了有人做肉鸡一直 DDoS 啥的然后导致一插网线就被运营商封？现在我也还原不了现场了，ThinkPad 重启后一切都正常了，不知道当时交换机灯狂闪在那闪什么，早知应该当时直接把路由器 WAN 口插电脑上然后开 Wireshark 抓个包。\n看了下 ThinkPad 的 Windows 日志，系统那一栏没有什么异常，到 6 月 26 号晚上 19 点之后就没有了，像是突然死机的那种。\n然后安全那一栏能看到很多登录失败的，像是 3389/SSH 被爆破\n\n以前也遇到过也没什么，我也没弱密码，单纯爆破应该发生不了这些事情\n对了，这台 ThinkPad 上还装有火绒，基本上只打开了文件监控和下载防护，火绒没杀到什么毒，今天也 Windows Update 了一波，那个恶意软件删除工具也没杀到东西。简单看了下进程啥的都没有异常。\n这一切事件太诡异了，首先之前这么久从来没出过问题，稳定得一逼，偏偏在我回国休假第二天出的问题（难道我被搞了？），然后死机就死机吧，这死机的时候交换机灯还狂闪还搞得上不了网，虽然我不知道是不是真的是 ThinkPad 发出什么有问题的包被运营商封，但是一强行关机重启马上就正常。而且当时确实路由器改 WAN 口 MAC 地址之后得了这么几秒，然后又一模一样的现象了，直到重启 ThinkPad ，真的太诡异了。\n害，有没有哥们支下招，有什么要检查的，最好能查查到底发生了什么",

          "description": "根本原因是 Plex 这家公司在往流媒体转型，很多方面压根就不会考虑 self-hosted 用户的体验。Plex 的优点无非就是 UI 更好看，易上手，bug 相对少一些，而这些你用 Infuse 都可以获得更好的体验。但 Plex 的问题大部分很难甚至没法解决\n1 、Plex 自带的播放器只支持 30 秒快进，而且是写死的。这个是在外网被说烂的 ticket ，但 Plex 官方没有任何要优化的意图，说白了就是自建用户的体验压根不重要。当然了你用 Infuse 这种第三方可以解决，但我都用 Infuse 了 Plex 跟 Jellyfin 有啥差别？\n2 、Infuse 直连 Jellyfin 的体验远好于 Plex ，不管是速度还是稳定性。Jellyfin 还有官方插件可以直接支持动态增量更新，Plex 那就慢慢等吧\n3 、Plex 对第三方插件的态度是没给你 ban 掉就感恩吧。这带来的后果之一就是 NFO 支持很烂，只能用五六年前的 XMBC 插件。对这当然能用，但你不能在界面里面修改 NFO ，也不确定以后会不会直接不给你用或者有什么兼容性问题。事实上最近若干年 Plex 基本就没有新的插件甚至是官方的插件文档出现，这是一个已经被废弃的功能。\n4 、Plex 对刮削的支持越来越保守。现在默认只支持 Plex 自己搞的元数据库，手动改成 TMDB 或者 TVDB 会弹警告让你升级。并且明确告知未来会取消对 legacy 元数据库的支持\n5 、Plex 只支持在线认证，这意味着你的家用服务器断开 Internet 在局域网也可能无法访问。\n6 、Plex 的趋势是在主页塞越来越多的私货，目前大部分都可以关闭或者移除，但未来就不好说了。你如果看过 Plex 在 AppStore 上的介绍，就会发现这货宣传重点几乎全是流媒体，只有最后一张图提了一嘴我们还支持自建服务器哦。\nJellyfin 优点就不说了，关于缺点\n1 、UI 很原始，但该有的功能都有，硬件转码配置也很方便，如果你用 Infuse 的话这应该不会是一个问题。iOS 和 ATV 上的 swiftfin 效果也还不错，但还有一些 bug ，社区更新也不算积极。\n2 、命名不规范的情况下，刮削命中率比 Plex 差。如果有良好的命名习惯或者用 TMM 批量修正的话这个也不是啥大问题。另外 Jellyfin 的手动修正比 Plex 稳定很多，Plex 的新 Agent 特别坑爹，有时候搜不到东西你也不知道为啥，我上次在 Plex 搜了半天龙珠 Z 竟然死活搜不出来，就很离谱。Jellyfin 再不济你可以直接填 TMDB 和 TVDB 的 ID 手动匹配\n3 、多主机、多用户支持没有 Plex 好。Plex 可以一个账户绑定多个主机然后统一管理，这个在 Jellyfin 这边没啥很方便的方案，不过我没这个需求就也还好。\n4 、分享功能对小白不友好，要么走 tunnel 比如 tailscale 之类的，要么就要反代到公网。授权也只能通过本地建新账户，而不是直接向对方账号发邀请的方式\n我的感受是现在已经不推荐购买 Plex 大会员了，尽管我之前买过 Plex 的终身会员。\n新用户尤其是个人用户不需要分享给一大堆人的话，这钱够买七八年 Infuse 了，而且 Infuse 还能家庭组拼车，基本等于不要钱。",

          "description": "前几天，去朋友工作的小公司溜达，朋友写前端，他身后一哥们写后端，看起来不到三十岁。我闲着无聊，就坐在后端老哥旁边，看他写写代码，不一会儿我朋友前端问题修改完了，打包项目发给他部署到服务器测试一下。这时候我看着后端开始了操作，他们用的是 Caddy Web Server ，于是后端就开始改 Caddyfile 文件：\n:2333 {\n   root * /var/www\n   file_server\n}\n\n:2333 {\n   root * /usr/root/dist\n   file_server\n}\n\n他简单的把之前的复制了一下，改了root路径，就打算重启caddy了。我说：端口也要改吧？他说：先试试。于是重启caddy，发现报端口重复的错误，又再次编辑Caddyfile，把端口改了。那一瞬间我甚至怀疑他是不是第一次写代码了，我虽然没用过caddy，但一个端口配置两个网站，稍微想想也不可能有这种操作吧？\n这件事让我想起几年前隔壁公司的一个女程序员 A ，因为大家一起下楼吃饭，也都比较熟，有一次 A 找我说：JS 有几个地方的代码报错，能不能帮她看看怎么回事？我过去一看，好家伙！一个类里面这样写着：\nclass Store {\n    function getItem(key: string) {\n        // TODO\n    }\n}\n\n我说类里面写函数为什么要加 function 关键字？她说好像有这种语法吧，她试了不行还以为开发环境哪里出错了！\n再说到另一个男同事 B ，这个同事是纯前端，完全不懂一点后端。有一次，他想试试用Node.js怎么读写数据库实现用户登录，然而编辑器却总是提示错误，我偶然瞅了一眼他正在摸索着写的代码，发现他在 JS 文件里这样写着：\nimport sqlite3 from 'sqlite3';\n\nexport function login(req: Request) {\n    sqlite3.SELECT * FROM users\n}\n\n我震惊了！函数里面都不是JS语法，这都看不出来？\n为什么我要说这几个事情呢，因为他们的情况真的太反差了。通过以上几个事情，不管是谁，第一印象都会觉得这几个人水平很菜。但除了第一个后端，后两个我是知道的。女程序员 A 和男同事 B 工作经历大概都是五六年了。\n女程序员 A 在他们公司干了两年，做的项目大概一二十万代码，她每天提交代码，开发能力肯定是够的，后面跳槽去了其他公司，据说干得也很好。\n男同事 B 参与的项目八十多万行代码（ css + js/jsx/ts/tsx + json ）,他参与需求开发和性能优化，平时的工作任务也没出过什么问题。\n你说他们水平不够吧，他们靠自己的能力完全能够应付日常的开发工作。你说他们厉害吧，有时候写出来的代码我甚至都怀疑他们会不会编程。（上面的几个问题，他们不是大意而犯错，是真的不知道自己写错了）\n真是奇哉怪哉！",

          "description": "站长如何选择博客平台?在选择博客平台时，需要综合考虑多个因素，包括平台的易用性、功能、自定义能力、社区支持、成本以及是否满足个人或企业的特定需求 http://m.bokequ.com/list/22-0.html\n　　以下是一些建议，帮助您选择适合的博客平台：\n　　 1. 评估平台类型\n　　综合性平台\n　　优点：用户基数大，易于上手，提供丰富的模板和插件，SEO 优化较好，有助于内容推广。\n　　代表平台：新浪博客、博客园等。这些平台适合博客新手或偶尔写作的人。\n　　开源博客系统\n　　优点：提供高度的自定义能力，可以根据个人喜好设计博客的外观和功能，支持多平台同步发布。\n　　代表平台：WordPress 、Typecho 等。这些系统适合有一定写作经验和追求个性化的博主。\n　　专业内容平台\n　　优点：提供更高的流量和关注度，有助于内容的传播，同时提供丰富的商业合作机会。\n　　代表平台：知乎专栏、简书等。这些平台适合专业写手或自媒体人。\n　　 2. 考虑关键功能\n　　自定义能力：选择能够完全控制博客外观和功能的平台，如 WordPress 。\n　　 SEO 优化：确保平台具备良好的 SEO 性能，以便提高博客的可见性和访问量。\n　　社区支持：选择拥有活跃社区的平台，有助于内容分享和互动。\n　　插件和主题：查看平台是否提供丰富的插件和主题，以满足不同的功能需求和设计风格。\n　　 3. 成本考量\n　　免费与付费：许多平台提供免费和付费两种选项。免费选项通常有限制(如广告、存储限制等)，而付费选项则提供更多功能和更好的用户体验。\n　　长期成本：如果计划长期运营博客，需要考虑平台的升级费用、域名和服务器费用等长期成本。\n　　 4. 用户体验\n　　易用性：选择界面友好、易于操作的平台，以便快速上手和高效管理博客。\n　　编辑器功能：特别是对于喜欢使用 Markdown 等轻量级标记语言的用户，需要选择支持 Markdown 的编辑器。\n　　 5. 特定需求\n　　内容类型：如果主要发布图片、视频等多媒体内容，需要选择支持这些媒体类型的平台。\n　　国际化需求：如果博客面向全球受众，需要选择支持多语言和多地区的平台。\n　　 6. 示例对比\n　　以 WordPress 为例，它提供了广泛的自定义选项、强大的插件生态系统和 SEO 友好性，但需要一定的技术知识和资源投入。而知乎专栏则是一个适合专业和深度内容创作者的平台，拥有广泛的受众和友好的用户界面。\n　　总结：选择博客平台时，请根据您的个人或企业需求、技术水平、成本预算以及长期规划进行综合考虑。通过比较不同平台的优缺点，选择最适合您的博客平台。同时，记得定期评估和调整您的博客平台策略，以适应不断变化的网络环境和市场需求。",

          "description": "发现自己情况有点类似，本来想回复的，索性直接开一帖，把一些话发出来也给自己解解压。\n我今年也 28 了，之前在一家医疗行业做前端开发，其实还是挺不错的，后面因为各种原因（这里说一下一个是工资一直没涨，我在公司负责的内容越来越多。另一个是当时买的基金亏钱了亏了 20%左右大概 2w 多，直接影响了每天的心情）长时间下来我觉得我也抑郁了，反正就是每天一到公司内心就开始难受，就想离职。在 23 年年初过完年我直接裸辞了，当时我也知道行情不好，还是毅然选择裸辞。当时跟领导提出要辞职后心里一下就好受多了，感觉一块大石头落地那种感觉。\n后面开始找工作，找了两个月没找到有点焦虑了，终于在 5 月份拿到了一份工作，薪资也有涨，技术栈从 vue 转到 react ，我觉得能胜任然后当时也不是很想继续再找了，就入职了。事实做下来技术这块也确实没问题，react 上手的很快。不过有个问题是做的事比较多，不是指开发，公司没有产品没有 ui ，原型图要前端去画，功能设计还要我自己去想，只有一个大纲。所以有点受不了，再加上买的基金没有及早抽身出来又亏了不少，还有下半年的时候我妈身体不好，去医院也花了不少钱做了不少次检查，最后也没查出具体问题（腹部痛腿痛这些，肠镜胃镜都做了也没查出问题），最后在新冠病毒变异时我中招了，身体上很难受再加上心里上的长期压抑，导致我又一次冲动离职。回到公司第二天我就跟领导提了。\n之后本来打算尽快找到工作的，然后找了两个月没什么回复，就索性懒得找了，准备躺平。\n人一闲下来就容易胡思乱想，就觉得看不到希望，在大城市房子也买不起，女朋友也没有。没人可以倾诉，不跟父母倾诉也是不想让他们担心。有时候真的就觉得活得好没意思，好痛苦。\n8 月初我注销了基金账户，简单收拾了下行李来合肥找工作（离家近，芜湖），投了两个星期吧，拿了 3 个 offer ，拒掉其中一个，选择了一家小公司，部门是初创的 2 前端 2 后端。入职一周的时候 hr 交社保的时候被告知社保是代缴的（什么人力资源公司），因为公司注册地不在合肥，这个是之前沟通时没跟提过，唉不过我自己也没问。然后我正好打算申请合肥的住房补贴（一个月 1250 ），结果这样我就不能申请了。于是我找了之前的一个 offer ，讯飞外包，准备去干着看看。这里也是非常冲动，没怎么考虑。\n去了外包后发现内网开发真受不了，办公电脑配置也差的要死 8g 内存。\n我当天就不干了，然后我又想回原来那家，但被 hr 告知离职公司规定离职后不得再入职了，其实我也是厚着脸皮了，正常人肯定不会再去找原单位了\n也是自从第一次离职后，感觉我越来越容易冲动离职了。第一次离职我犹豫了半年。\n现在的情况是合肥这边岗位少的可怜，能投的基本都被投过了。\n唉大好的机会给我却被我浪费了。\n后续也不知道怎么办了，有想过要么回上海继续找。\n说出来后感觉轻松了一点，今天一天心情真的超压抑",

A request that arrives sooner than 100ms after the previous one is put in a queue, and here we are setting the queue size to 20.\n\nThat means if 21 requests arrive from a given IP address simultaneously, NGINX forwards the first one to the upstream server group immediately and puts the remaining 20 in the queue. It then forwards a queued request every 100ms, and returns 503 to the client only if an incoming request makes the number of queued requests go over 20.\n\n结合代码和这段文字，我对 burst 的理解是：\n6r/m：以每 1 分钟为一个时间阶段，将这 1 分钟分为 6 段，即每 10s 最多接收 1 个请求，该 10s 内的多余请求将会被返回 503 ；\nburst=5：突发队列长度=5 。以每 1 分钟为一个时间阶段，在这 1 分钟内，该队列最多只能接受 5 个请求，即使该队列内的请求已经被处理，也不会往队列里新增新的请求，直到下 1 分钟到来。\n测试\n测试工具：jmeter \n\n预期结果：\n在 120s 内，一共发起了 120 个请求，其中请求成功 22 个(6+6+5+5)，其余返回 503 ；\n实际测试结果：\n在 120s 内，一共发起了 120 个请求，其中请求成功 17 个(6+6+5)，其余返回 503 ；\n为什么少了 5 个请求，希望大佬们为我指点下，谢谢~",

          "description": "自从去年 9 月公司散伙之后，boss 上沟通无数公司，几乎没有回复。本地有家公司给了个机会，上了几天班感觉不对，就没去了。之前在 v2 写了个帖子介绍这个经历。\n前公司散伙的时候，前老板让我想办法把我之前做的 UWB 定位系统方案卖了，给我分成。然后我就建了个网站，也在知乎上写了些文章。\n有不少人咨询，但是都没有下文，一直到 6 月份，才有一个公司表达了购买的意向，对方是国企，到现在合同都没签，他们还在走内部的流程。\n去年底决定做独立开发。打算做一个自动运维的软件，折腾了几个月之后，发现还是应该继续搞 UWB 定位。\nUWB 定位这个东西，我已经做出了一个完整的系统，还量产了，从技术的角度来说，也到了一定的深度。并且，在业内有一定的“知名度”，至少有不少人知道有这么个公司这么个人，在做这个事，效果还可以，技术也靠谱。\n我可以把这个作为自己的立足点。之前做的东西，知识产权当然是前公司的，但是，我可以继续往深处搞/往广度搞，可以重新做出一套不同的东西出来。例如之前的系统是上行 TDOA 定位，我可以做下行 TDOA 定位，还可以增加 TOF 定位等等。以后可以靠卖技术卖方案挣钱。如果有人买老系统，我就跟前老板分成，如果买新系统，就是我自己的。于是就把以前弄的东西又翻出来，开始做一些以前想做但还没有做的事，把 UWB 定位继续往深处搞。\n前两周，有个深圳的老板联系我，邀请我到他们公司上班。他是看了我在知乎上写的文章之后，大概觉得我还可以，是个合适的人选，所以联系我。\n对方是个做嵌入式的初创公司，目前只有几个人。如果我过去，是负责软件这块工作，大概算是软件经理吧。\n纠结了很久，从目前的情况来看，如果继续坚持弄 UWB 定位，收入很难保证。如果运气好，也许能挣点钱，如果运气不好，生活都困难。深圳这边如果上班，马上就会有工资收入。\n但是这个年龄(56+)还要去深圳，实在是有点那啥。。。。\n老板建议我可以先到深圳看一下，大家见个面，也到公司看看。然后我上周去了深圳。\n最终决定还是去深圳吧。我跟老板说，先搞 3 个月试用期，大家都有足够的时间做出评估。如果大家都觉得 OK ，就继续下去；如果哪方觉得不行，随时可以中止。\n跟老板沟通过几次，感觉老板是个技术上的大牛，一直在跟踪蓝牙标准，跟我谈到蓝牙标准有好多不足之处。虽然我对蓝牙不了解，但是感觉他说得比较有道理。老板的很多理念跟我相似，但是我不确定他是真的这样，还是投我所好。无所谓了，如果理念一致，大家相处会比较愉快；如果是投我所好，大家应该也会相处愉快。\n在过往的职业生涯中，很多次从零开始组建团队，看样子这次也是要从零开始咯。",

          "description": "起因\n自七月开始，手机开始陆续收到一些短信、贷款的推销短信。\n到了八月初，首先是接到了一个电话，声称我有一笔 “医疗补充金” 待领取。这种话术一听就是推销 or 诈骗，直接就挂断掉了。这个时候也没有特别关心，只是觉得推销越来越多了。\n之后的节奏就开始疯狂起来了，他们使用不同的短信签名发送内容大致相同但推广链接不同的短信。一会是信用飞、好分期、众安金融这些短信，一会又是通过不同的手机号码（非固定电话，全部是个人号码，但都是虚拟运营商）进行骚扰。以近乎每日一条甚至两三条的频率疯狂推送短信，电话则是每周能接到两到三次。\n我的号码会在工作中使用，短信尚且可以编辑规则屏蔽，但电话无能为力。来电的号码归属地哪里都有，除了都是虚拟运营商外，没有其他规律。\n端倪\n虽然短信签名不同，但他们使用的短链接大多相似。比如他们使用的一部分域名：\nkg1.cn\ngh1.cn\nqw7.cn\n8rf.cn\n这些域名都在近期内完成了 ICP 备案，并且来自不同的主体，大概是收购来的备案或域名。\n而贷款短信中的链接点进去会直接跳转到正规的小贷平台，跳转携带了 aff 链接。这些小贷平台会结算佣金，但不知道这条代理链条有多长，也拿不到相关的资料。\n无独有偶，在“医疗补充金”的骚扰电话来电后，也会收到一条签名为 “保单在线” 的企业所发的短信，使用的链接同样是与上述短信相同的 xxx.cn 格式。这个所谓的 “医疗补充金” 和 “保单在线” 其实已经被许多组织预警，可以查询到很多关于他们的信息。你点进他们的链接订阅了他们的产品后，他们会划走高额的订阅费用，大概率是针对不会操作取消订阅的群体。\n如图：\n滥发 106 短信，电话语音诱导诈骗别人订阅产品，听起来比较老的手段，今天仍然还在。\n最后\n其实在今天，骚扰短信和电话早就算是一件小事。我们的数据、信息早已被链条上的既得利益者传的满天飞。但见到这种程度的骚扰，终究还是令我比较担忧。\n我们作为每天耳濡目染这些圈套的人，也只能堪堪应对。很难想他们通过这些手段欺骗了多少不懂退订的中老年人。可能像是我的父母一样，上了年纪也不会操作，只能吃了哑巴亏。\n即便最后发现并通过种种方式退订，早就不知道被划走了多少隐性费用，但又够不上报警的条件。这种事情更不会告诉在外工作的子女，就这样被骗走少则几十多则几百上千的费用。\n个人的力量终归太有限，我很希望能深挖这条灰色链条，但又苦于没有时间、精力，也没有足够的手段制裁。能做到这些多多少少依赖着灰产。很多材料还能深挖出一些蛛丝马迹。但真的，个人的力量太弱小了。\n很无奈，但我能做的也只是把他发出来。",

          "description": "如果一个人没上班或者处在下班后的时间，你跟他说，猪肉一块钱十斤，他肯定会觉得要么你疯了要么商家疯了，因为他的理智告诉他，几乎不可能有这么卖猪肉的。\n但是，一旦类似的情况发生在公司，情况完全就变了。\n我们以熟悉的互联网公司为例。比如面试，我们都知道技术注重的是实操，但是很多公司就是喜欢面八股文，不注重实操。再比如加班，明明没什么事做，早点下班休息，第二天精神饱满才能更好干活，但是公司就是不让走，哪怕坐着玩手机都行。\n这些事情，在任何有理智的个人看来，都是很无语的行为，但是公司就要这么做。为什么呢？\n如果我们把视角拉高一点，从整个社会的视角看，把公司当作劳改所，把员工当作犯人。这样一来所有的事情就变得合理了，员工进来就是有罪的，而公司的义务就是把“犯人”好好改造。\n公司说猪肉一块钱十斤，你说不对，那就“打”，“打”到你同意为止。（“打”表现为降薪、扣绩效、辞退）\n公司说你活着全靠老板赏你饭吃，你反驳说你凭自己的能力挣钱吃饭，还是“打”，必须得把你这种“病态”的价值观“矫正”过来。\n当你活干得好的时候，就给你改善下“伙食”（加薪、奖金），当你没干好的时候，迎接你的就是“打骂”。\n所以，我不禁想到：在公司这座“劳改所”里，与其说员工是在赚钱，不如说是在接受劳改。改造的不能有自己的理性思考，改造的要默默为资本家服务。\n所以公司，不是单纯的经济实体，而是资本控制人们思想的统治工具。\nPS：只是随便聊聊一些看法，有不同意见欢迎评论理性探讨。",

However, it is noted that public-sector spending in Sweden accounts for up to three-fifths of GDP, and in 2014, the percent of national wealth owned by the government was 24%. Additionally, SOEs are significant in various sectors across Europe, including Sweden, particularly in network industries like energy and transport. This suggests that while specific figures for Sweden's SOE share are not provided, SOEs play a substantial role in certain sectors of the economy.\n关于瑞典经济中的国有企业（ SOE ）份额，搜索结果中没有明确的详细信息。然而，据了解，瑞典的公共部门支出占国内生产总值（ GDP ）的五分之三，而在 2014 年，政府拥有的国民财富比例为 24%。此外，国有企业在包括瑞典在内的欧洲各国的多个行业中具有重要地位，特别是在能源和交通等网络行业。这表明，尽管没有提供瑞典国有企业份额的具体数据，但国有企业在经济的某些领域中发挥着重要作用。\n简直是国进民退的典范。",

          "description": "今天我们聊一聊电影。\n死侍与金刚狼\n昨天去电影院看了《死侍与金刚狼》，说实话这个电影一般，双方莫名其妙的打了起来，又莫名其妙的和好了。多元宇宙这个词，就像死侍说的，已经被漫威玩烂了，死去的英雄又复活，原来前一部设定好的剧情，这一部又被推倒重来。\n总结这部电影就是个爆米花电影，你就为自己的情怀买单或者无脑跟着死侍吐槽傻笑就完事了。\n在电影结束的时候，放了很多金刚狼拍摄的花絮，却勾起了很多逝去的回忆。\n金刚狼主演或者参演的电影一共有十部，最早的一部是 2000 年的《 X 战警》，后面《 X 战警》又出了很多部，再后来又为金刚狼为主线拍了好几部。\n休杰克曼与金刚狼\n休杰克曼，演了这个角色二十多年，在花絮里他透露，当他第一次定好妆容时，工作人员甚至问他：你是谁啊，金刚狼是长你这个样子吗？\n而现在，只要看到休杰克曼，就想到了金刚狼，看到金刚狼，就想到了休杰克曼，他演活了这个角色。漫画里金刚狼是个个子很矮的杀人机器，而休杰克曼演的，虽然脾气火爆，但是身材高大威猛，那一身的腱子肉，站在那里就让人望而生畏了。\n在血脉喷张的杀戮背后，休杰克曼赋予了这个角色更深邃的层次，他迷茫，痛苦，矛盾，思索人生的意义，思考爱情的真谛，他渴望爱人，又害怕爱人，他想要亲情，却又害怕 失去。表面漠不关心，背地里却总是为团队做的牺牲最大的那个，就像他对小狼女说的，每个我爱或者爱我的人最后都因为我死去，我眼睁睁的看着他们死去，却无能为力。\nX 战警的印象\n第一次出场在《 X 战警》中，金刚狼给我的感觉很复杂，说他很菜吧，他有利爪，又有极强的自愈能力，说他很强吧，他跟魔形女打架，却打不赢，感觉他很笨重，不灵活，跟万磁王单挑，无奈万磁王就是他的克星，一招就把他制服。\n后来几部 X 战警陆续出来，虽然他做了很多的牺牲，差点被小淘气吸光生命，忍痛送走了琴，都没有给人留下很深的印象。这个系列电影里的变种人实太多，大家都各有所长，所以他没有那么出众吧。\n金刚狼系列电影\n但自从金刚狼系列电影出来，一下子就被这个角色深深吸引，形象变得特别立体了。\n《金刚狼》第一部终于弄清楚了他的身世由来，为什么叫做金刚狼，金刚利爪是怎么来的，一一做了解答。这部电影里再也没有觉得他又菜又厉害了，后期做完手术 carry 全场，太帅了。\n《金刚狼》第二部主要发生在日本，增加了很多日本的元素：和服，武士刀，新干线。开头那幕，被原子弹的烈火包围，整个人都被灼烧殆尽，但是又很快复原，徒手从心脏里取出机械虫子，强悍的跟个怪物一样，但是他和真理子在一起，制造了很多的反差，像是美女与野兽。\n而在第三部里也表现的很反差，当金刚狼逐渐衰老，当金刚利爪无法伸出，当自愈能力越来越弱时，他也进入了每个普通人的宿命：迟暮与死亡。而根据他的基因培育出来的劳拉，也就是小狼女，正是勃勃生机，无限活力的时候。\n老头与萝莉，开着一辆快报废的车子，行使在无边无际，渺无人烟的沙漠里，还有比这更吸引人眼球的组合吗？最后他为了救下一代的变种人而选择自我牺牲，劳拉哭着喊着他 daddy 的时候，几乎要泪目，这是这个角色最高光的时候，他选择一种最伟大的解脱自己的方法。\n每个人都有英雄情节吧，有的是父亲，有的是超人，有的是孙悟空，他们拥有我们不曾拥有，也永远不会拥有的能力，他们就是这个平凡世界围墙里的一道光，带我们冲突高楼大厦的禁锢，走向幻想的无限世界。\n休杰克曼之后，再无金刚狼。\n顺便预言一下：既然马斯克这么喜欢 X ，会不会收购 X 战警呢？",

          "description": "首先，道歉，鞠躬，我错了。我将清空我的屏蔽列表，并且真诚地向所有 block 我的，和被我 block 的用户道歉。\n好的，那么，本文描述我曾经的行为，我这么做的原因，以及我未来的改进，和对与我有相同困惑的人的建议。\n如果你不需要知道我的心路历程，那么 TLDR: 我将会对所有人更加友善。\n我做了什么，得到了什么样的结果\n我发布了一条提问 如果申请一个域名指向 127.0.0.1 ，依照法律规定需要备案吗？ ，并且在文末写了“请注意，本提问是在法律规定层面的，任何忽视这一点的一律 block 。从技术层面，流量不经过公网当然不会被检测到”。\n这似乎引起了很多用户的不满， @somebody1 说 “楼主好 nb ，不过我先一步把你 block 了。知道为什么吗？谁教你问问题这么强硬的，v2 们欠你的吗？”， @tywtyw2002 说 “#18 根个小孩子计较什么，默默的直接 B 了就好了。回帖还会浪费铜币。PS 。看了下他的帖子 25 届的，中二时期”。\n并且，讽刺我的回复有非常多的“感谢”数。\n我这样做的原因是什么\n本质上，我是希望能收缩讨论的范围（求推荐 windows 笔记本，下面一堆人推荐 macbook ），减少无效讨论。这点相信大家都有体会。\n此外，还会有很多糟糕的回应：\n一种是毫无价值的低质量回复或劝退，例如“不做就是了”，“做这个干嘛”。\n还有一类是“教你做事”，给你回复一些根本不符合现实的建议，或者正常人早就知道的基础知识，例如我上面的提问中有很多人反复提到“改 hosts”。\n除此之外还有很多。由于 1.我相信我的提问有价值和可行性（各路由器管理页面有类似做法） 2.我了解大多数基础的计算机网络知识和最新动态 3.我确定这个问题的答案一定是法律层面的。 所以我写下了 “任何忽视这一点的一律 block”。\n这类很糟糕的回应，有各种原因，可能是根本没看题目，可能是个性就喜欢跑题，也可能… 我们就不展开了。总之，我个人觉得，\n我未来要怎样做\n在争论之前，考虑你争论的代价。对所有陌生人保持礼貌，忽视不友善的人，而非与他们争辩。在上面的这个提问中，“任何忽视这一点的一律 block” 就是一种非常激进，非常冒犯的做法。即便回帖的人给我垃圾回复，我又有什么损失呢？但如果让“正常人”发现我在和回复者吵架，这会极大地抑制他们回复的欲望，甚至让我的个人形象受到损失。我个人认为，在公开场合的激进的表态，是非常高风险的。\n不要用计算机屏蔽，用你的大脑屏蔽。我曾经认为 Shadow Ban 是非常可恶的发明之一，但现在我明白了，这是妥协，不仅是向上层监管的妥协，也是向下层用户的妥协。看到一个用户非常糟糕，但你不应该 block 他，你应该忽视他，用你的大脑完成 Shadow Ban ，不要将这个过程 Offload 到电脑上。这也可以让你看到目前的环境是怎样的，让你更好地评估，更好地了解这个世界。\n做正确的事，但什么是正确的事？正确的事一定是在正确的环境中，正确的话只对正确的人说。更何况，在公开的，与陌生人交互的场景下，我们如何确定什么是正确的？这种时候，用平和的，照顾大多数人的做法，才是正确的做法。\n有人会向我提议，为什么不抛弃 V2EX ，你的英文水平已经足够好，你应该在英文社区提问。但我觉得，很多问题是需要中文环境，是中文的使用地区所特有的，比如网站备案。我曾经认为，中文是我的枷锁。我为了这个想法而努力学习英文，当然没有坏处，但中文应当是我的一项技能，是上天的恩赐，让我能够解决更多问题，做更多事。\n在之前，\"Put on your helmet and keep going forward\"，这是我对自己的期待。但现在，我觉得时机还不够成熟。隐藏你的锋芒，把自己分裂成多个不同的形象。向大多数人展示你 \"Balanced\" 的那一面。稳定的，调和的，平衡的 kkocdko ，会比以往更加优秀，更加强大。",

          "description": "2024 ，0805-0811\n8 月 4 日是极简时钟 iOS 上架七周年纪念日，我居然都忘了，过了两天才想起来。\n从这周开始，又进入了一个新的开发周期。\n报名 SHIP-A-TON\n周二的时候得知 RevenueCat 开展了一个名为 SHIP-A-TON 的 Hackathon ，基本的规则也很简单，就是提交一个新 App ，只要集成 RevenueCat 的 SDK 就可以。\n\n我犹豫了一天， 周二的晚上报了名。我的参赛作品就是最近在写的新 App ，然而我根本不指望这个 App 能获奖，我只想靠这次机会完成它，与其漫无节奏地开发，不如在一个目标的激励下去步步推进，毕竟 deadline 才是第一生产力。\n周三的一整天我没有动手写代码，而是在脑中计划如何写完这个 App 并顺利提交。我算了一下，从周四（ 08-08 ）开始写的话，到比赛的截止日期（ 09-18 ）是 42 天，正好是 6 个星期。于是我就在网上找了一个 Weekly Plan ，改了一下，打印出来。我把每天的工作计划都写上去，希望 6 个星期后能够写满 6 页并顺利提交 App 。四天过去了，我其实并没有严格按照 todo list 去写代码，总是脑子突然冒出一个想法，或者碰到一个优先级更高的任务，就脱轨了。\n\n除此之外，我还采用番茄钟+vlog 的方式来记录这一次的开发过程，除了每天有代码产出，还要有视频产出。我发现这两个方法同时使用的时候，比单独使用番茄钟还会令人更专注，毕竟旁边录着像，就不敢溜号去浏览跟开发无关的内容了。过去四天，每天的工作我都用剪映或者秒剪生成一个 20 秒左右的短视频作为每天的视频产出，打算每七天剪一个长一点的视频，作为开发进度的见证。\n小红书的视频没有外链，只能这么分享出来了。\n\n本周学习\n首先还是要感谢肘子哥，本周遇到了两个 SwiftData 方面的问题，在他的 Discord 里提问后很快就得到他的解答。另外他的 blog 也是值得反复学习，这周又有几个其他方面的问题，在网上搜索后答案都在他的 blog 里：\n避免 SwiftUI 视图的重复计算\nSwiftData 中的关系：变化与注意事项\nSwiftUI 4.0 的全新导航系统\n其他：\nFormatting Numbers in SwiftUI，学会了如何在 SwiftUI 的Text中对数字进行格式化\nDon't write this code! (use NSCache instead 😌)，一句话就是不要用自己写的字典当做缓存，要用专门的NSCache\n\n生活点滴\n看完了《龙之家族》第二季，三颗星\n去电影院看了《抓娃娃》，三颗星\n读完了《认知驱动》，但没有《认知觉醒》对我的启发和冲击那么大\n卖掉一个旧键盘，立刻下单了新键盘\n自学两个多月，录了上百遍，终于录成了一遍大小拉小手+風になる",

          "description": "魔兽世界国服回归后，新版本《地心之战》即将登场，网易推增值服务“网易DD”提供带打服务，疑似官方下场参与RMT（Real Money Trading，即现实货币交易）事件，在玩家社区中引起了广泛的关注和讨论。\n\r\n\r\n事件概述\n\r\n\r\n网易有爱是网易官方推出的一个魔兽世界插件整合包，类似魔兽世界大脚插件或CurseForge，在国服重开之后，“网易有爱”更名为“网易DD”，并且重做了客户端，加入了更多的板块，8月22日，网易DD首页推出了一项增值服务，是以抢卷的方式为玩家提供H菲莱克地带打服务，原来30元的价格，降到0.01元，相当于用一分钱就让玩家体验其他工作室带打服务。另外，客服会强调这是官方团队，并且把这次的H菲莱克形容为“公益团”的带打行为。\n\r\n\r\n对此，玩家对此反应强烈，认为官方下场RMT破坏了游戏的平衡性和公平性，直接触及了游戏公平性和玩家体验的底线，使得游戏环境变得更加恶劣。同时，这也引发了玩家对网易运营能力和游戏未来的担忧。\n\r\n\r\n官方回应\n\r\n\r\n8月22日，网易运营团队在国服《魔兽世界》官网发布公告表示，此前引发大量玩家讨论的网易 DD“找人带带”活动已经下线。公告原文如下：\n\r\n\r\n\r\n亲爱的玩家：\n\r\n\r\n今日，网易《魔兽世界》官方运营团队收到玩家社区反馈，网易互联网新产品“网易DD”上线了暑期活动“找人带带”，并引发大量玩家讨论。我们第一时间与网易 DD 的同事们展开沟通，经协商，目前该活动已经下线。\n\r\n\r\n网易DD是网易集团旗下独立运营的工具软件，目前处于内测阶段，其运营行为具备自主性。在本次活动开展前，集团内部缺少及时的同步沟通，因此对社区造成了困扰，我们深感抱歉。\n\r\n\r\n未来我们将强化对各类工具软件的合作沟通机制及监督流程，始终把游戏的长期健康发展和服务广大玩家需求作为唯一目标，杜绝再次出现此类导致游戏社区困扰的活动。\n\r\n\r\n\r\n对游戏生态的影响\n\r\n\r\n根据国服暴雪战网最终用户许可协议1.C.iii.条款，战网用户同意不利用平台或游戏作为任何未被本协议授权的商业用途，包括以代练、租借通行证或游戏账号等形式进行游戏相关的服务以换取酬劳。\n\r\n\r\nRMT行为在网络游戏中有着复杂且深远的影响，以下是一些主要的方面：\n\r\n\r\n游戏公平性受损：RMT行为的存在使得玩家可以通过现实货币直接购买游戏内的优势资源或服务，从而破坏了游戏的公平竞争原则。\n\r\n\r\n玩家体验下降：对于坚持通过自身努力提升游戏水平的玩家来说，RMT行为无疑是一种打击。他们可能会因为无法与RMB玩家竞争而感到沮丧和失望。这可能导致非付费玩家失去游戏兴趣，影响游戏的用户基数和社区健康。\n\r\n\r\n破坏经济系统：RMT行为会破坏游戏内的经济平衡，一些玩家通过购买强力装备或虚拟货币获取优势，而不需要花费相应的时间和精力。这会导致游戏内的竞争失衡，可能让那些靠努力获取资源的玩家感到不公。\n\r\n\r\n深层原因\n\r\n\r\n虽然RMT行为在某些方面可能为工作室公司带来短期经济收益，但从长远看，游戏工作室对一款网络游戏的生命具有极大的破坏力，工作室会破坏游戏的平衡性和公平性，导致玩家流失，会大大缩减游戏的寿命，影响游戏的整体健康发展。游戏的开发商和运营商通常会采取有效的措施来限制工作室的活动，以确保游戏的可持续发展。\n\r\n\r\n既然如此，为什么网易为什么还要官方下场参与RMT行为呢？这和目前的市场环境有很大关系。\n\r\n\r\n目前的经济政策在一定程度上影响了企业的行为模式，导致一些企业倾向于追求短期利益，喜欢赚快钱，不肯投太多钱搞研发，喜欢偷别人的技术。\n\r\n\r\n经济政策朝令夕改，具有极大的不确定性，这种不确定性使得企业难以进行长期规划，因为未来的政策可能会突然改变市场环境，导致企业前期投资大量损失，为了应对这种不确定性，企业可能更倾向于短期快速获利，赚快钱，而不是进行长期投资，忽视了长期的品牌建设和可持续发展。\n\r\n\r\n网易做为一家庞大的游戏企业，也喜欢赚快钱。由于长时间的政策性风险，能够存活下来的网易，在结构性上就只有运营赚快钱游戏的经验，给它一个需要长期运营的游戏，它根本就不知道怎么才能有效运营，它从根本上还是打算执行运营一个只能存活1、2年的游戏的策略，只倾向于追求短期利益，而从不考虑长远发展，这就是网易为什么要做出这种让玩家匪夷所思行为的深层原因。\n\r\n\r\n结语\n\r\n\r\n综上所述，网易《魔兽世界》疑似官方下场RMT事件对游戏生态和玩家体验造成了严重影响，网易应该及时悬崖勒马，亡羊补牢，采取积极措施来应对此事件，确保游戏环境的公平性和健康性，同时也应加强与玩家之间的沟通和交流，共同推动游戏的持续健康发展。",

          "description": "闲来看剧，无意中在腾讯视频看了几集《诛仙》动漫，虽然个别人物在建模还不算特别满意，但总体还是很不错，而且冲着对原著的高度还原，瞬间有种入坑不能自拔的感觉。\n第一次接触诛仙小说应该也是十几年前的事情，高一高二一度沉迷网络小说，一发不可收拾，断断续续的看了不少。惊叹于作者对于诛仙世界架构和故事逻辑，主副线也很完整，人物鲜活丰满，而且文笔也不错。最引人瞩目的当属主人公的感情纠葛，碧瑶的虽死不悔的爱，陆雪琪的温婉素雅和为了张小凡的付出都是让那时的我特别特别感动的，从当时来说，诛仙确实是非常可以带给人一种震撼的感觉的。\n如今从动漫入局，又把原小说看了一遍，梦回青春年少的仙侠错觉，总有种说不清道不明的神奇滋味。",
