          "description": "Our bias is to always add more. More rules, more process, more code, more features, more stuff. Interdependencies proliferate, and gradually strangle us. Systems want to grow and grow, but without pruning, they collapse. Slowly, then spectacularly.\nWhen a piece of trash drifts across the beach, it is our duty to pick it up so the next person can enjoy a pristine shoreline. When a thousand pieces litter the beach, it is too late. We can only lament the landscape. That’s just how beaches are now.\nA good system is designed to be periodically cleared of cruft. It has a built-in counterbalance. Without this pressure, our bias drives us to add band-aid after band-aid, until the only choice is to destroy the whole system and start from scratch.\nWhy is it so much easier to add than to remove? Maybe because we attach our identity to what is visible. But there is a difference between the ornamentation that defines our style and the vestigial burdens we carry.\nRemember those who did the invisible work of removing. Their legacy was not to build a sand castle, but to care for the beautiful beach on which we play.",

          "description": "This started out as a weekend hack with gpt-4-mini, using the very basic strategy of \"just ask the ai to ocr the document\".\nBut this turned out to be better performing than our current implementation of Unstructured/Textract. At pretty much the same cost.\nI've tested almost every variant of document OCR over the past year, especially trying things like table / chart extraction. I've found the rules based extraction has always been lacking. Documents are meant to be a visual representation after all. With weird layouts, tables, charts, etc. Using a vision model just make sense!\nIn general, I'd categorize this solution as slow, expensive, and non deterministic. But 6 months ago it was impossible. And 6 months from now it'll be fast, cheap, and probably more reliable!\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41048194\nPoints: 33\n# Comments: 22",

          "description": "Hey, everyone\nI made a website that lets you find study partners/groups based on the specific course/book you are studying.\nIt's 100% free + no registration required.\nWhy:\nI know there are many subreddits for finding study partners. But, one of the biggest reasons we can't find the right partner/group is lack of clarity.\nMost posts that I read on Reddit were something like:\n\"I'm interested in programming. Let's study Python together...\" - That's not a clear goal.\nBut, when you say\n\"Let's study the Python for Everybody course on Coursera. I'm from Mumbai, India, and I'm looking for study partners in the* timezone (UTC+5:30). I'm fluent in Hindi language. I have 2 years of experience in C++, so I understand the fundamentals of programming. Happy to host the group and contribute\" - that will lead to higher quality engagement.\nIt's also difficult to search + filter posts on Reddit, based on my learning requirements.\nKeeping all these pain points in mind, I've built Moocable, where you can search & filter posts based on the course/book you're learning + timezones + languages + level of experience.\nLastly, you can use it to discover new learning materials. Some of you might have used https://www.classcentral.com/\nI'm building a similar library for Moocable, you can easily search and discover new learning materials.\nIf you are looking for study partners, give it a try!\nP.S.: I've manually filled the first ~100 posts. Each post is 100% authentic, scraped from subreddits/Coursera forums/niche websites.\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41024964\nPoints: 37\n# Comments: 11",

          "description": "Demo: https://designer.sendune.com/\nCode: https://github.com/SendWithSES/Drag-and-Drop-Email-Designer\nHTML for email is probably the hardest code to write. Even a teeny-tiny deviation from the rules will break the email in untold combination of os/desktop/mobile clients.\nIt's mid 2024. Almost 50 years since email was invented and 35 years since HTML was born. A 'basic-open-source-HTML-email-designer' must be a solved problem, right? We thought so too.\nSadly, that's not the case.\nThere are a few decent open source email designers but they carry dependencies that make them cumbersome to embed within your app. That's why we decided to open source our HTML Email Designer.\nThe SENDUNE email designer focuses on simplicity and ease of use.

I would like to know more because i think that this language might be a powerhouse in per se.\nSince my studies are quite basic in this regards i would like to expand my knowledge on it and kind of specialize myself both in this world and another world (ontologies :D) that i really enjoy.\nWhat's prolog like in 2024? what are you wonderful people doing with it?\nthanks from a dumbass :D\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40994552\nPoints: 282\n# Comments: 175",

          "description": "Hi, everyone. I created a note-taking website for electronics and circuits where you can draw circuit diagrams and write text notes at the same time.\nI am a Digital IC designer, and I self-study different types of analog and digital circuits a lot. However, I found a problem. Circuits have many different architectures and are hard to memorize due to numerous experiential tips. I want to document what I learn in my note app, but I found there is no method for me to easily draw circuit and block diagrams alongside text notes.\nThis issue has bothered me for a long time, from my master's school to my current working life. I decided to solve it, so I created a note-taking website specifically for electronics and circuits, called VisCircuit.\nWith VisCircuit, you can easily draw circuit diagrams, block diagrams, and write text notes simultaneously. I have already used it for two weeks and have noted down things I find hard to remember, such as SRAM, amplifier circuits, and PCB components of Arduino and Raspberry Pi. I found this tool really useful for memorizing knowledge about electronics and circuits.\nCurrently, I have opened VisCircuit for alpha testing, and I want to let some people use it and give me feedback. Feel free to try it, and I will really appreciate what you think about this project. Leave any suggestions for improvement. Thank you very much.\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40987770\nPoints: 32\n# Comments: 1",

See a demo: https://www.traceloop.com/video or try it yourself at https://www.traceloop.com/docs/demo.\nWhen moving your LLM app to production, significant scale makes it harder for engineers and data scientists alike to understand when their LLM is hallucinating or returning malformed responses. When you get to millions of calls to OpenAI a month, methods like “LLM as a judge” can’t work at a reasonable cost or latency.

          "description": "Hey Hacker News!\nThis is my first post here. About 5 months ago, I left my job because I was completely burnt out. After taking some time off, I started freelancing. But I found tracking my time to be a real hassle as I kept forgetting to start or stop the timer and often had no idea what I’d worked on.\nSo, I decided to build Taim as a side project, while also working now on some freelancing gigs. Taim is going to be automated time tracking tool for freelancers and teams. It’s designed to make tracking time effortless and accurate, so you can focus on your work and not worry about the clock.\nI’m excited to share this with you all and would love your feedback! Currently planning to launch it to the public in a few months.\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40977453\nPoints: 92\n# Comments: 57",

          "description": "Sometime in early 2022, my wife and I started watching Jeopardy! regularly, almost by accident. Inspired, I thought it would be fun to create and host my own games with family and friends.\nBy September 2022, I debuted Buzzinga at a family reunion. Back then, it was just a website running locally on my MacBook. It was a total blast, and I knew this was something the world should enjoy too.\nI launched Buzzinga.io in December 2023 and have been rolling out regular updates for our 2000+ users ever since.\nFeatures:\n- Built-in buzzer support (phones and physical buzzers)\n- Automatic scorekeeping\n- User-friendly host controls\n- Highly customizable\n- Supports multiple clue types: text, image, audio, and video\nThe site does not require sign up to play around with, only to create your own games.\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40960508\nPoints: 161\n# Comments: 38",

          "description": "Hey everyone, James from Silogy here.\nWe’re excited to open-source our test runner, Smelt. Smelt is a simple and extensible test runner optimized for chip development workflows. Smelt enables developers to:\n* Programmatically define numerous test variants\n* Execute these tests in parallel\n* Easily analyze test results\nAs chip designs get more complex, the state space that needs to be explored in design verification is exploding. In chip development, it's common to run thousands of tests, each with multiple hyperparameters that result in even more variation. Smelt offers a straightforward approach to generating test variants and extracting valuable insights from your test runs. Smelt integrates seamlessly with most popular simulators and other chip design tools.\nKey features:\n* Procedural test generation: Programmatically generate tests with python\n* Automatic rerun on failure: Describe the computation required re-run failing tests\n* Analysis APIs: All of the data needed to track and reproduce tests\n* Extensible: Define your tests with a simple python interface\nYves (https://github.com/silogy-io/yves) is a suite of directed performance tests that we brought up with smelt – check it out if you’d like to see smelt in action.\nRepo: https://github.com/silogy-io/smelt\nWe built Smelt to streamline the testing process for chip developers. We're eager to hear your feedback and see how it performs in your projects!\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40945671\nPoints: 39\n# Comments: 0",

          "description": "I'm tired of working full-time at companies that waste my talent and energy. I want to work for myself.\nAs a side hustle for the last few years, I've been designing custom concert visuals and releasing them on a monthly schedule. I've released 48 VJ packs so far and created a following within the niche community of VJs. These VJ performers then remix my visuals into their live performances at concerts. My setup is unique in that you can download every VJ pack by becoming a member on Patreon.\nI want to take it to the next level and make it into a full-time business but I'm struggling to figure out next steps. It would be helpful to get an outsider's perspective since there are so few people doing this line of work and I feel a bit lost.\nAs far as I can see, there are two routes to go down:\n1) Create custom visuals for touring musicians. Should I find a rep or agency to represent me for landing big projects? Should I start reaching out directly to the business managers of musicians? Should I start a company with a partner?\n2) Continue making VJ packs for thousands of VJs internationally. Should I move to an annual membership fee instead of a monthly membership fee on Patreon? Should I move to an online shop format instead of a Patreon membership?\nBiz folk, what am I missing? What am I not considering?

          "description": "Even when these things have proven themselves to be very useful in widespread use.\nThis is something that is playing a major part in impeding my progress, blocking my motivation to learning some tech skills that are more in demand. Especially since I currently have no job, so there is no real-world frame of reference to understand why they could be important. Why they could save my butt one day or make my life easier.\nAt some point, long ago (2012-ish) I was no longer required to do deployment for web, but unfortunately I never caught up because I was never made responsible for production ever again. So I am just familiar with old ways of deployment and missed out on a lot of changes that led to where full-stack web dev is today.\nThis mostly goes for a lot of skills in CI/CD and cloud that are in demand these days. Some of it comes up more in full-stack job interviews, in terms of, do you have experience with XYZ or how would you use XYZ in some situation. I have no good answer for them because I haven't really learned how to use them. And I haven't learned how to use them because I can't come up with problem scenarios where they are a possible solution. For instance, why do I need Jenkins and Chef when I can already test, SSH and add scripts and cron jobs no problem. Why would I need the cloud when my past jobs and clients got by well with a cheap shared host. For uploading files I just needed to know at least two of these three- Git, rsync, and SFTP.\nIt's not that I actually believe most of these things are \"useless\". But rather that my mind can't draw a good problem scenario for them. So from my POV they look like solutions looking for a problem. Maybe my experience just has no good frame of reference for those things.\nDiscovering a context, a frame of reference to understand these tools and apply them- especially without a job -that's what I want to figure out.\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40940158\nPoints: 30\n# Comments: 26",

          "description": "Hi HN!\nI just released version 1.0 of Posting, an open source terminal application I've been working on which you might find useful if you work with, test, or develop HTTP APIs!\nPosting (https://github.com/darrenburns/posting) is an HTTP client, not unlike Postman and Insomnia. However, as a TUI application, it works over SSH and enables efficient keyboard-centric workflows. Your requests are stored locally in simple readable YAML files, meaning they're easy to read and version control.\nSome other features include:\n- \"Jump mode\" navigation\n- Environments/variables with autocompletion\n- Syntax highlighting powered by tree-sitter\n- Vim keys support in much of the UI\n- Various builtin themes\n- A config system\n- \"Open in $EDITOR\"\n- A fuzzy search command palette for quickly accessing functionality.\nPosting is written in Python using the Textual[1] framework, which I also help maintain.\nAlthough 1.0 has been released, it's not yet feature complete. I'd love to hear feedback from the community to make sure I'm on the right track and learn what's important to people.\nSo, if you have any thoughts, feature requests, or opinions, big or small, I'd love to hear them. At this early stage, your ideas can really help shape the roadmap of the project!\nThanks,\nDarren\n[1] Textual: https://github.com/Textualize/textual\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40926211\nPoints: 102\n# Comments: 34",

For instance, when I'm on a Google Meet call in one tab and playing a YouTube video at full volume in another tab, the video’s audio isn’t picked up by Google Meet. This isolation doesn’t happen if I use different browsers for each task (e.g., Google Meet on Chrome and YouTube on Chromium).\nDoes anyone know how Chrome and Chromium achieve this audio isolation?\nGiven that Chromium is open source, it would be helpful if someone could point me to the specific part of the codebase that handles this.

          "description": "Hi HN, I’m Joan, the developer of Quicklang. I made this app to easily translate and keep in sync all my localization JSON files for my side projects. While searching online for a similar tool, I only found enterprise solutions that do not allow direct editing of JSON files.\nI used to use ChatGPT to translate the JSON translation file changes before coding Quicklang. However, I realized that ChatGPT only allows you to input short content for translation into another language (even if you provide a .json file), and each time I had to request translations for one language at a time. So, I decided to build an app that only sends the changes I’ve made to the OpenAI API and easily translates them into all the target languages for my side projects.\nTechnical details: I used Next.js to build the front end and backend, and I use a custom VPS (EC2 instance) on AWS to handle the translation process. This is because the translation can take several minutes, and Vercel Functions time out after 10 seconds by default (up to 60 seconds on the Hobby plan). Finally, I save the translation files in an S3 bucket.\nWhat’s next? I want to add cool features like change history, the capability to add context to the OpenAI API to make translations as accurate as possible, and maybe allow developers to interact with the API in order to use the tool.\nLet me know your thoughts and feedback. It’s been a blast working on this so far, and I think it’s just neat :)\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40907528\nPoints: 26\n# Comments: 17",

          "description": "I love Jupyter – it's how I learned to code back when I was working as a scientist. But I was always frustrated that there wasn't a simple and elegant app that I could use with my Mac. I made do by wrapping JupyterLab in a chrome app, and then more recently switching to VS Code to make use of Copilot. I've always craved a more focused and lighter-weight experience when working in a notebook. That's why I created Satyrn.\nIt starts up really fast (faster time-to-execution than VS Code or JupyterLab), you can launch notebooks right from the Finder, and the design is super minimalist. It's got an OpenAI integration (use your own API key) for multi-cell generation with your notebook as context (I'll add other LLMs soon). And many more useful features like a virtual environment management UI, Black code formatting, and easy image/table copy buttons.\nFull disclosure: it's built with Electron. I originally wrote it in Swift but couldn't get the editor experience to where I wanted it. Now it supports autocomplete, multi-cursor editing, and moving the cursor between cells just like you'd expect from JupyterLab or VS Code.\nSatyrn sits on top of the jupyter-server, so it works with all your existing python kernels, Jupyter configuration, and ipynb files. It only works with local files at the moment, but I'm planning to extend it to support remote servers as well.\nI'm an indie developer, and I will try to monetize at some point, but it's free while in alpha. If you're interested, please try it out!\nI'd love your feedback in the comments, or you can contact me at jack-at-satyrn-dot-app.\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40899242\nPoints: 182\n# Comments: 60",

          "description": "Hi all! Excited to share rss2newsletter after completing dev work for the initial release.\nThe idea for this project came out of necessity, as I wanted to share my articles via email newsletter. I was looking for a super minimal, lightweight, and open source solution, and when none existed, I decided to create one.\nFor any sizable number of email recipients, a popular platform like Mailchimp will easily cost you hundreds or even thousands per month in per-contact fees. rss2newsletter, on the other hand, allows you to use Amazon SES, so you can reach your audience at pennies on the dollar.\nBeyond these factors, I also wanted something that could run on an internet-connected potato it's so easy on your system and fully automated so you can set it and forget it.\nSo, I created (and put under a free software license):\nhttps://github.com/ElliotKillick/rss2newsletter\nrss2newsletter (integrating with Listmonk and Amazon SES for ultra-low-cost emails) is a drop-in solution that requires almost no setup besides connecting with SES and styling your emails. It's also competitive at what it does with proprietary self-hosted solutions like Sendy, which requires your system/VPS to have some rather beefy specs to run well.\nLet me know if there are any other features you would like to see. I hope you can find my project helpful to you!\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40898313\nPoints: 32\n# Comments: 11",

          "description": "I've created Foorr, a minimal to-do list app that focuses on short-term getting-things-done and the option to do this with friends by holding each other accountable and helping each other grow together. Main goal is to fuel your progress whatever needs to be done and hold yourself accountable for your own progress (with some external motivation).\nHere's what it does:\n- Create tasks for today and tomorrow only (real hyperfocus on short term GTD).\n- Invite friends to cheer each other moving forward.\n- Building up a daily streak as you finish all tasks daily. All tasks completed before midnight which were planned for that day, earns you a level up. Rewarding that sense of completion.\nWhy I built it:\nI used physical post-it notes and was a bit done with it. I really wanted something minimal focusing only on my to-do's for today and tomorrow.\nNo bloated features, nothing to fancy/polished, just something no-nonsense I wanted to use myself. It might be useful for others who struggle with procrastination and keeping op progress getting things actually done. Feedback is definitely welcome and nice to hear if this resonates with anyone else.\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40877708\nPoints: 14\n# Comments: 8",

          "description": "Transfer Thought is a No-Code platform that makes it so anyone can build VR apps directly in their browser.\nWe started this company part-time, building it during commutes to and from work on the train. Over the last 5 years, we've experienced many ups and downs:\n- Gained early customers\n- Quit our day jobs\n- Secured angel funding\n- Survived with a short runway\n- Accepted into Techstars Chicago\n- Survived with a short runway (again)\n- Landed our biggest client ever, a Fortune 100 company\n- Despite our highest revenue, our burn rate caught up to us\nWe looked at different ways to wind down the company and ultimately felt open sourcing the platform was the best way to do right by our customers.\nNow, anyone who is interested in starting a VR company or just building an app can pick up where we left off. I'm excited about this space, if you need help with a VR app, or want to talk tech, please reach out.\nCheck out the repo: https://github.com/transferthought/transfer-thought\nContact me at keenan [at] transferthought [dot] com.\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40869706\nPoints: 7\n# Comments: 0",

          "description": "jb is a UNIX tool that creates JSON, for shell scripts or interactive use. Its \"one thing\" is to get shell-native data (environment variables, files, program output) to somewhere else, using JSON encapsulate it robustly.\nI wrote this because I wanted a robust and ergonomic way to create ad-hoc JSON data from the command line and scripts. I wanted errors to not pass silently, not coerce data types, not put secrets into argv. I wanted to leverage shell features/patterns like process substitution, environment variables, reading/streaming from files and null-terminated data.\nIf you know of the jo program, jb is similar, but type-safe by default and more flexible. jo coerces types, using flags like -n to coerce to a specific type (number for -n), without failing if the input is invalid. jb encodes values as strings by default, requiring type annotations to parse & encode values as a specific type (failing if the value is invalid).\nIf you know jq, jb is complementary in that jq is great at transforming data already in JSON format, but it's fiddly to get non-JSON data into jq. In contrast, jb is good at getting unstructured data from arguments, environment variables and files into JSON (so that jq could use it), but jb cannot do any transformation of data, only parsing & encoding into JSON types.\nI feel rather guilty about having written this in bash. It's something of a boiled frog story. I started out just wanting to encode JSON strings from a shell script, without dependencies, with the intention of piping them into jq. After a few trials I was able to encode JSON strings in bash with surprising performance, using array operations to encode multiple strings at once. It grew from there into a complete tool. I'd certainly not choose bash if I was starting from scratch now...\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40864541\nPoints: 116\n# Comments: 42",

          "description": "Hi! I wanted to share an open source API-compatible replacement for SQS. It's written in Go, distributes as a single binary, and uses SQLite for underlying storage.\nI wrote this because I wanted a queue with all the bells and whistles - searching, scheduling into the future, observability, and rate limiting - all the things that many modern task queue systems have.\nBut I didn't want to rewrite my app, which was already using SQS. And I was frustrated that many of the best solutions out there (BullMQ, Oban, Sidekiq) were language-specific.\nSo I made an SQS-compatible replacement. All you have to do is replace the endpoint using AWS' native library in your language of choice.\nFor example, the queue works with Celery - you just change the connection string. From there, you can see all of your messages and their status, which is hard today in the SQS console (and flower doesn't support SQS.)\nIt is written to be pluggable. The queue implementation uses SQLite, but I've been experimenting with RocksDB as a backend and you could even write one that uses Postgres. Similarly, you could implement multiple protocols (AMQP, PubSub, etc) on top of the underlying queue. I started with SQS because it is simple and I use it a lot.\nIt is written to be as easy to deploy as possible - a single go binary. I'm working on adding distributed and autoscale functionality as the next layer.\nToday I have search, observability (via prometheus), unlimited message sizes, and the ability to schedule messages arbitrarily in the future.\nIn terms of monetization, the goal is to just have a hosted queue system. I believe this can be cheaper than SQS without sacrificing performance. Just as Backblaze and Minio have had success competing in the S3 space, I wanted to take a crack at queues.\nI'd love your feedback!\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40837610\nPoints: 326\n# Comments: 86",

          "description": "I'm not a genius, nor do I believe I'm the absolute best at what I do.\nIt took me 30 years to realize that, no matter how good I am, networking often determines success. I'm in a career I don't enjoy, unable to move up or change, while others get jobs through connections. About 80% of my colleagues were hired this way, while a few of us got in by luck.\nNetworking seems to drive career advancement.\nI'm naturally a loner and find it hard to feign interest in others' lives. I prefer spending time alone and struggle to genuinely connect with people.\nEmotional intimacy drains me, and I dread future interactions, even though I know this is normal.\nWhile I'm okay being alone, I feel that relationships are crucial for progress after a certain point.\nI even broke up with my partner because I can't handle constant companionship. It was so draining that I stopped enjoying sexual intimacy.\nI'm fine without a partner; I don't want to subject anyone to my solitude. However, I want to change careers, and I know connections are vital.\nI'm feeling stuck and unsure how to move forward. It seems the two crucial factor (luck and networking) are outside my influence.\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40833149\nPoints: 18\n# Comments: 13",

I've posted Pickcode a few times (most recently https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38365638), but we've improved things quite a bit so I thought it was worth posting again. This is a bit of 1.0 release after a long year of working on the company full time!\nPickcode is basically Replit-lite, for kids. The editor is simple: text editor + output console + big green button to run your code. We support Python, HTML/CSS/JS, Java, and our block/text hybrid language, Pickcode VL.  We're partners on code.org's Hour of Code, and hundreds of thousands of students have tried our free stuff through them.\nAn account for individual kids is totally free, and we offer some free Python and Pickcode VL lessons to get them started. We make money by selling licenses to schools for better customer support and roster/lesson management features.\nYou can use this demo account I made to try out the editor:\n  email: demo@student.pickcode.io\n  pw: Demo1234\n\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40831904\nPoints: 28\n# Comments: 7",

The best way to get started is with the docs - https://r2r-docs.sciphi.ai/introduction.\nThis is a major update from our V1 which we have spent the last 3 months intensely building after getting a ton of great feedback from our first Show HN (https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39510874). We changed our focus to building a RAG engine instead of a framework, because this is what developers asked for the most. To us this distinction meant working on an opinionated system instead of layers of abstractions over providers. We built features for multimodal data ingestion, hybrid search with reranking, advanced RAG techniques (e.g. HyDE), automatic knowledge graph…",

It crashes sometimes still on mobile devices.\nI wasn't able to take photogrammetry photos of the artifacts from the tomb in the Museo Egizio in Turin because they were traveling while I was there (and now the museum is closed to install a new roof anyhow), so I tried to include comparanda from other museums where I had scanned artifacts.\nI tested the same dataset with 3d Gaussian Splatting but that had lower resolution results for great complexity in frontend code and reduced performance on older devices. [3DGS tour: https://mused.com/en/tours/860/learn-about-3d-gaussian-splat...]\nMoving forward, if anyone's working on the same idea, I didn't find a good path to monetization through web-based 3d content, so I'll take the high resolution photogrammetry of spaces into Unreal and switch to desktop and headset builds.\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40789339\nPoints: 14\n# Comments: 2",

          "description": "After 13 years in SWE, working for startups, bigger companies, the golden handcuffs, etc, I can finally say that I think I'm finished.\nRight now I'm contracting to stay afloat, maintain flexibility and delve into entrepreneurship, but I truly don't know what the future holds for me anymore if building my own company doesn't work out. I have 0 inclination to go back to a 9-5 at a company coding for a living. I'm done. I've been an EM, which might arguably be the most miserable position that exists. I've been senior/staff at places, and honestly I just don't enjoy arguing about the structure of software anymore, I'm tired of the personalities, tired of the infantilization of the industry (frankly, it's embarrassing) but mostly, I just don't enjoy coding as much as I used to, unless I'm leveraging it to create an asymmetrical amount of value for me ($$$$) which is just not what a full time job is.\nHowever, I don't know what to look into as an alternative if I need a full time position once my wife and I start having kids. My strengths revolve around people and strategy. I've been considering sales at a tech company because to me, working harder and having an unlimited cap in what I can earn sounds pretty fantastic.\nWould love to hear any kinds of stories or tips from folks\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40780940\nPoints: 95\n# Comments: 41",

This could lead to rendering corruption, as described in issues such as: https://github.com/doitsujin/dxvk/issues/3961\n Fixed multiple issues that could cause crashes or unexpected behaviors when re-creating an NvFBC capture session.\n Added support for EGL_KHR_platform_x11 and EGL_EXT_platform_xcb on Xwayland.\n Fixed a bug that could cause some displays to appear multiple times in the nvidia-settings display layout configuration page on systems with multiple GPUs.\n Added a PipeWire backend to NvFBC that allows it to work on the Wayland compositors that support screencasting via XDG Desktop Portal. This new interface will be available through an upcoming Capture SDK release.\n Added support for multiple concurrent clients to NvFBC direct capture.\n Added reporting of Vulkan information to nvidia-settings control panel.\n Compiling nvidia-settings from source now requires Vulkan header files to be available.\n Support DRM-KMS explicit synchronization via the IN_FENCE_FD mode setting property.\n Support VRR (Variable Refresh Rate) for Wayland on pre-Volta GPUs.\n Added support for Variable Refresh Rate on notebooks with the open kernel modules.\n Updated glXWaitVideoSyncSGI() to be more efficient.

And I think it's among the worst piece of software I ever used. \n I usually don't want to do anything fancy, just a bunch of simple slides, some text, some images. Even doing that is hell, because everything looks shit by default.\n Last time I wanted to use, god forbids, 2-3 simple animitations to highlight stuff. That seemed to break a lot of stuff. Some text just disappeared. Some text just froze and I couldn't change anymore. When I saved the file, the saved file didn't contain any images.

I had long-standing bug of very slow wakeup-from-suspend - it could take 10 to 15 seconds until screen lights up and system becomes responsible. It started in Q2 2022, and after that no amount of tinkering allowed it to be fixed. Until recently, when my wife's machine got quite wet, and I replaced my SSD with her's to let her work while her motherboard dried up. Of course Windows did what it like to do the most - disabled my UEFI and enabled secureboot. After swapping SSD back and fixing the bootloader, I found out that the slow wakeup bug disappeared completely.

          "description": "When I first discovered Linux about four years ago, I was using beginner-friendly distributions such as Linux Mint, Manjaro, and Ubuntu. After that, I switched to Arch Linux then Gentoo with DWM as my window manager. Because Gentoo forces you to basically set up your OS and what software you want on it, I learned so much about Linux from using it. I loved the productivity gains I got from using DWM as my window manager.\n However, over the years, I realized that I was spending more time configuring my system than actually using it. I was applying as many patches as possible to DWM for increased productivity and speed. I compiled all my packages with several C compiler optimizations such as LTO, Graphite, march=native, -O3, etc. All of this didn't actually make a noticeable impact, it was more of an obsession I had with squeezing the most performance and productivity out of my system as I possibly could. Basic things like configuring my monitor setup was difficult on such a minimal configuration. I came to the realization that the law of diminishing returns is completely true. I became less productive and less focused on my work as I continued to try to optimize my system further.\n I recently installed CachyOS with the graphical installer and chose KDE Plasma as my desktop environment. I have to admit that the user experience is just better. I can still tile windows if I want, it's just not automatic. I can also set up keyboard shortcuts so that I don't have to use the mouse often. Honestly, KDE Plasma can do most things a tiling window manager can do and much more. It \"just works.\" I have come full circle. I feel like the IQ bell curve meme applies perfectly to this situation.\n Having said all of that, do I regret trying Gentoo and DWM? No. I learned so much about Linux and low-level C programming just by tinkering with them that in the end I think it was worth it. But it definitely won't be my daily driver.\n    submitted by    /u/SaltyMaybe7887  \n [link]   [comments]",

Made a post a few hours ago about my ideas for getting into microscopy - this citizen/democratization of science stuff is right up my alley for the same reason free/open source/libre software is.

Anyways, today I note the patches have been added, so I did the following:\n  \nCompiled a custom linux kernel for my Manjaro system using this guide\n Installed the Vulkan Wayland HDR WSI Layer from u/Zamundaaa's GitHub page using these steps\n Added KWIN_DRM_ALLOW_INTEL_COLORSPACE=1 to /etc/environment - not sure if this has any effect\n Enabled HDR for the display kscreen-doctor output.eDP-1.hdr.enable\n Tested a HDR video with ENABLE_HDR_WSI=1 mpv --no-config --vo=gpu-next --target-colorspace-hint --gpu-context=waylandvk --gpu-api=vulkan \"/home/user/BEST HDR DEMO FOR TVs ｜ 4KHDR TEST.webm\"\n  \nHowled in pain as my eyes got blinded by so many nits... Just kidding... or am I? 🫠 The video opens up in HDR and it's so gorgeous. As good as it does in Windows. Essentially, this means I can now watch HDR movies on Linux. I hope Chrome adds HDR support too, YouTube is the final missing piece of the puzzle.\n TIPS:\n  \nSDR colors may look off at first, to fix this - Go to Display Settings and set SDR Color Intensity to 100%\n SDR brightness may be too bright - Go to Display Settings and change SDR Brightness as desired, mine is on the second slider value\n  \nLong live Linux! 🐧\n    submitted by    /u/pee_wee__herman  \n [link]   [comments]",

I’m not saying that that there isn’t going to be a year for the Linux desktop because people fucking hate it, it’s because like we have seen the market share will steadily grow until it hits a point that if you don’t support Linux, your product cannot reach its full potential. Even if the year comes around it shouldn’t be called the “year of the Linux desktop” it should be called whatever the most popular operating system that uses the kernel is because Linux is a kernel, not an operating system.\n My guess is if there is a “year” of the Linux desktop it will have to be in 20 years.

Some of that blame should be nvidia not linux.\n Number two it seems like alot people try to do very complicated wine stuff right out the box. I get it because there were programs I missed a lot after switching. I'm guilt of this one, I found the simplest way was to run a vm of windows for the longest time.\n Number three seems to be gaming, I know linux doesn't run number of games but with proton it getting better. I just want to state this though it not linux fault that game don't support it.\n I more technical user so I might be missing something. \n To me the average computer user could use linux without a problem, it very stable and with fantastic desktop environments like kde gnome that are very easy to use.\n It maybe I'm bias just because it fits my use cases.

Fractal Design is still not offering the finished case for sale, but has published the 3D print files with which you can print the case yourself (https://www.fractal-design.com/north-pi-3d-files/).\n What does this have to do with Linux?

          "description": "In the summer of 1999 I began working on a C++ code generator. When I gave Bjarne Stroustrup a demo of it in 2003, I had a web interface. Eventually I realized that I should develop a command line interface and I was able to start doing so in 2009. For a short time, I had a 2-tier system with the command line front end. It wasn't long before I added a middle tier. Today it's implemented as a 3-tier system where each of the tiers is in C++.\n I started with Red Hat and used Arch and a number of distros until around 2014 when I switched to FreeBSD primarily due to wanting to use the kqueue/kevent API. Then around 2022 I switched back to Linux primarily to be able to use io-uring. My front tier, though, is very portable and also runs on Windows, MacOS, and the BSDs.\n Because my back tier is proprietary, there are some who have not appreciated my work. I'm sorry but making the service available for free is the best I can do. \n It's been a wild ride. Back when I gave Stroustrup a demo I was broke from investing in my company. I was living with a 96-year-old woman with two small dogs she didn't allow outside. Part of my rent was cleaning up after the dogs. Her first name was Constance -- it took me a while to realize that was a great name for a roommate to someone working on a C++ code generator.\n Thanks for reading.

I'll look for a laptop without an OS or will anyway install a Linux distro.\n I know that for example laptops bought in China that have Windows come with a Chinese Windows version that has issues with drivers, languages, etc. But does it stop with the kernel or is firmware also different?\n I've heard of the evil maid attack for example, and even though I plan to buy a laptop only from the official brand stores (Lenovo, HP, etc.) is there anything I need to worry with regards to the device I'm buying being compromised or my privacy being compromised?\n What are the steps I should do when I buy a new laptop, I'm currently learning about flashing your BIOS, etc, is that enough? \n If I can only buy a Windows laptop and do that, end up erasing and formatting my hard drive and installing a Linux distro from my USB is there still anything else to worry about with regards to drivers (I know this is a stupid question because drivers come with the kernel, but will they be properly installed or is there something in the BIOS preventing this.)\n I'm sorry for the long question, I hope there is someone to give me a technical answer or even a step by step list of what I should learn to understand this issue.\n Thank you!!!\n EDIT: I meant the CosmicStrand rootkit.\n    submitted by    /u/ntdGoTV  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I have recently dual booted into Windows after half a year of not using it to use some applications, but encountered an interesting and mildly annoying issue.\n For context, I have two SSDs, one for Windows, and one for Linux which I have been using as my daily driver. Both GRUB bootloader and Linux live on the same disk (which I have verified with lsblk), Windows on the other. By all logic, this setup should prevent Windows from accidentally overriding the GRUB bootloader with the Windows bootloader. \n However, when I booted into Windows, I saw a loading bar reminiscence of a Windows 7 loading bar. Perhaps it was a large update, but right after this, when I switched my boot order back to GRUB, I was immediately greeted by a rescue shell as GRUB gave me an \"unknown filesystem error\". \n The fix was easy enough using a liveUSB, chroot and grub-install + grub-update, but it left me thinking how I can prevent this from happening to me again. I was also wondering if anyone else has faced this issue, despite also having their Linux and Windows physical boot disk being two separate drives. Did Microsoft make some changes such that Windows even checks other drives now for EFI partitions?\n Also, I know some people might give the meme answer of \"Don't use Windows\", but unfortunately school work requires some really iffy programs that only works on Windows. \n    submitted by    /u/Derpythecate  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "TLDR, can you guys think of any other examples of this?\n So, there's this video editor for Linux called DaVinci Resolve Studio, and although it's available for all three operating systems, the Linux version doesn't support AAC audio. What this effectively means is anything you record on a standard consumer device like a phone or a budget camera or OBS out of the box will have no sound unless you convert it first.\n Why? Well, this is just extrapolation on my part, but I found out that the license holders for AAC demand it be paid on a per-device basis. Even though you can get Windows for free, Windows and Mac can both be assumed to have already paid the licensing fee. With Linux, you can't count on anything like that. Even if they sold a plug-in to add the functionality, you would have to activate it on every computer you installed it on, or they would have to work out a deal where you could buy the codec for Linux itself on every Linux install. This would most likely stop Adobe Premiere from supporting it if it ever got ported to Linux.\n The reason why free programs like Shotcut and kdenlive are able to support it is because they aren't being used for commercial work. I don't understand how myself, but in the DaVinci Resolve subreddit, I found out that Hollywood actually scans your work to make sure that everything was above board, and if you tried using one of these free programs, it would get flagged. And Hollywood's not using AAC audio anyway. Well, outside of the trailers, they post on social media, but that's probably coming from a Mac device instead of a Linux device.\n Anyways, that's one example of how the free and customizable nature of Linux can hamper the functionality of cross-platform software. The functionality of our computers is held hostage by legal BS. Can you think of any other programs that would run into this kind of patent nonsense that would keep it from being able to be ported on Linux?\n    submitted by    /u/Indolent_Bard  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Before using Wayland, I was on X11 with DWM as my window manager. I wanted a similar setup for Wayland. I tried three tiling Wayland compositors, DWL, River, and Hyprland. However, I experienced a lot of issues with all of them. For one, on DWL, you can't change your XKB keyboard layout configuration at runtime. Because of this, I switched to River. However, River, like most Wayland compositors, doesn't give you the ability to disable vsync for certain windows. This is important for games because you want the lowest latency possible. Finally, I switched to Hyprland. Hyprland gives you the ability to disable vsync for fullscreen applications. However, Hyprland is full of bugs. Some Wayland applications don't work on it and screen recording with OBS causes the framerate to dip.\n Ultimately, the fact is that there isn't one option that is free of major bugs and has all the features I want. There's just less variety on Wayland than X11 at the moment. In addition to that, I don't like Wayland's philosophy. It wants to force compositors to be a certain way. Basic things like using keybinds for OBS become difficult as a result. What if I want to disable vsync for the entire compositor? What if I want to not have a compositor altogether and just use a window manager? This is just not possible on Wayland. I don't like the fact that X11 will be obsoleted in favour of a restrictive protocol.\n    submitted by    /u/SaltyMaybe7887  \n [link]   [comments]",

One thing that recently stood out to me since migrating to Linux is Crostini's Terminal feels rather quick, but this also puzzled me. Why does my somewhat dated Chromebook feel fast while my overpowered Linux system feels just a little less fast?\n Like most things Linux, I did a little research and found the culprit; my Keyboard Repeat Delay and Rate Settings don't feel ideal for my system. So, I quickly made some changes to these and, voila, Konsole and everything keyboard related (you do use the keyboard right?) is speedy! Yay! That said, if you configure this and it feels just a little too fast, try to give yourself a little time to get used to it before reverting the changes.\n Hope this helps someone else enjoy Linux even more!\n Cheers.\n    submitted by    /u/BinkReddit  \n [link]   [comments]",

I’ve used Debian for the last 10 years or so and love everything about it, my DE of choice has always been xfce. I love Debian’s stability, but wanted something a bit more “rolling-release” style, more regular updates. I have a Debian-testing machine and like it, but just feel like branching out. \n So I’ve started using Sparky for the last week and it’s going well, but I don’t see many people talking about it. \n Does anyone have opinions on a similar Debian distro that is better, or have good things to say about Sparky? I’ve used Mint, it’s cool but not my preference, and I’m not a huge fan of Ubuntu. So I guess I’m just asking for opinions on Sparky, and any similar alternatives people might have in mind - Debian, but with more regular updates. \n    submitted by    /u/topcatlapdog  \n [link]   [comments]",

The fix to that was to tweak some modprobes\n $ sudo vim /etc/modprobe.d/nvidia.conf # and add the following options nvidia-drm fbdev=1 options nvidia NVreg_PreserveVideoMemoryAllocations=1 \n Followed by\n $ sudo update-initramfs -u $ sudo reboot \n There is still some slight lagging on Chrome after resuming from sleep, but I can work with that a bit for now\n Refs:\n  \nhttps://wiki.hyprland.org/Nvidia/\n https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/NVIDIA/Tips_and_tricks#Preserve_video_memory_after_suspend\n https://download.nvidia.com/XFree86/Linux-x86_64/435.17/README/powermanagement.html\n https://www.reddit.com/r/hyprland/comments/1b5f11n/solved_nvidia_suspend_wakeup_fix/\n  \n   submitted by    /u/aeahmg  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Im a windows user and ive tried using linux for the past week. I really like it and wish i could use it so bad, but i cant. Ive noticed though all the issues i have had are soely because its not supported.\n My gaming performance is usually worse when using proton, however if games were just native it would be fine. I get small amounts of input lag so i cant play competitive games properly. This is likely caused by proton which exists because theres no support. Wayland provides worse performance and more input lag on my nvidia gpu because nvidia doesnt work great with it, but the alternative x11 doesnt work great with 2 monitors of different refresh rates.\n My rgb software and afterburner just dont work. Hdr isnt supported. Most anti cheats dont work. I had weird issues installing davinchi resolve, and once i had it was buggy.\n Theres little fault of the operating system itself and its literally just because nobody cares to support something only 4% of people use. If i want an experience without loads of troubleshooting every time i install something, im basically forced to use windows. I think windows is clearly inferior in every way. Just the support it gets keeps is on top.\n Kind of sad. The linux community and valve have done so much to make it better, but it cant be a viable replacement for windows for many people because companies wont make apps for it.\n    submitted by    /u/No-Drawing-1508  \n [link]   [comments]",

I want to share my personal experience installing with a computer that I bought and brought Ubuntu 20.04 as it's OS.\n I started the computer, and everything went ok. Then Ubuntu obviously said to me that I required some important updates and I did agree.\n After Ubuntu updated and the reboot, then I was not able to boot the OS. So knowing a bit of how linux can be sometimes I decided to read online if this was a problem with GRUB settings, and of course it was. I set \"nomodeset\" and then I was able to boot again. \n Next issue was that I was not able to change my brightness, I took some hs looking for similar problems people faced and the only solution that worked for me was installing a soft fake brightness app that emulates the brightness controll quite well for being not a proper solution.\n I was \"okay, now I can finally open vim, put some music with cmus and start working\", and then for course when I plugged my headset I had no sound, and I had to modify the rate sample at /etc/pulse/daemon.conf in order to make it work.\n So basically it was a \"You have the OS but now you need to fix some driver / configuration issues in order to use it\".\n And no, this is not a rant saying that linux is bad or that Ubuntu sucks, it just a shared experience and I realized that if I had to spent a whole day to make my laptop functional, I cannot imagine what a nightmare could be for a user without any experience in linux (mine is minimal though).\n    submitted by    /u/Strad3x  \n [link]   [comments]",

While I could test different software elements, I only have two monitors (one on my laptop) so I couldn't experiment too much.\n I'm sure preference and other factors affect the 'ideal Linux monitor setup', but I think that analyzing your guys' setups could help me come closer to a conclusion. A couple of questions:\n  \nHow many monitors do you use?\n How are they laid out?\n What DE/WM are you using?\n How do you organize your virtual desktops?\n  \nI'll start:\n  \nNumber of monitors: 2\n Layout: One 27-inch primary monitor in front and one 17-inch secondary monitor (laptop) to the left\n DE/WM: i3wm\n Virtual desktops: I manage virtual desktops with keyboard hotkeys, all the even workspaces are on my primary monitor, all the odd workspaces on the secondary.\n  \nAlso, a couple more productivity-related questions that aren't necessarily about monitors: - What works best for you? - How have you optimized your setup for productivity? - Any tips or tricks that you'd also like to share?\n Thanks for reading!\n    submitted by    /u/DatCodeMania  \n [link]   [comments]",

However, to me, these videos actually demonstrate how Linux is about as useful as a Chromebook for most professionals. Now that gaming is mostly solved, we really need to figure out the professional software situation on Linux.\n The other issue is that people who have invested thousands of dollars into their hobbies can't switch without effectively throwing all that money away, which is a real shame because I can't really argue against that. It's one thing to set up your workflow with Linux as a beginner, but if you've already spent thousands of dollars on plugins for Adobe or VSTs for Windows, then switching becomes a lot less tempting even if you really want to.\n Finally, one thing I've noticed is that it doesn't seem like it's the software itself that's the problem, but it's mostly the proprietary DRM they use. Maybe Valve, or Futo, or some other company with an incentive to push Linux for consumers, could works with companies like Adobe to get their software working through wine, much like Proton did for gaming. That way, their efforts are being funded by every customer rather than just the 3% of Linux users. However, this still adds a layer of uncertainty, as an update may or may not end up completely breaking that functionality. Working professionals might not be comfortable with that.\n    submitted by    /u/Indolent_Bard  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "After seeing 100's of \"switch to Linux\" posts over the past year, I think I will offer a solution by simply pointing out the false dilemma that is self-imposed by the askers.\n Should you switch to Linux? Should you dual-boot Linux? Are you worried about corrupting systems? Are you afraid of making the move to Linux?\n You can try this which will be far less scary or painful, keep your Windows or whatever system you use, and buy a used laptop off eBay to install Linux on. This way you get the best of both worlds without risk.\n You now do not need to worry about anything going wrong, you do not need to worry about transferring data or losing important files. No complications of dual booting, if you later decide Linux isn't for you then you still have your old Mac or Windows desktop/laptop. \n Just because you want to experience or use Linux, this doesn't have to be an all or nothing switch. Many people (myself included) happily use Linux and Windows.\n The great thing about Linux (especially lightweight DE's like XFCE) is that Linux runs snappy and crisp on older hardware. So don't think of it as \"I have to sell my old boots to buy a new pair of boots\" You can keep your old comfortable boots, buy a new pair, and wear both.\n    submitted by    /u/Lux_JoeStar  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hi again! I posted here my story about my week experience with Arch Linux three weeks ago. I was really surprised and had very good attitude to use it.\n Actually, I did not many problems, maybe with Wine and Lutris, but I solved it really quick, so it wasn't big deal. \n I love Yay, this is so helpful and quicker than Pacman, makes same, but for me works pretty well. Not without reason seems really popular.\n And at the end this, no I don't comeback to Windows, I don't want to change to another distro, Arch especially with Gnome looks and works really well, I did want to make chance to KDE, but KDE in default looks too similar to Windows for me.\n So yeah it was a hard, but I already really love Linux. The format disk with Windows was the icing on the cake!\n Cheers and have a good day/night!\n And I can't forget about:\n I use Arch btw.\n    submitted by    /u/wisielczyk  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Was using Windows since I was 12 but about a month ago switched to daily driving kubuntu due to me being worried about what Windows was doing with my data (still have it dual boot cause SATs consider Linux cheating but rarely ever boot into it). \n I never really \"liked\" the experience of Windows tbh, the OS just felt confusing to me even after using it for many years. For example: I can right click to eject a USB stick but have to go to another menu to eject SSD's on Windows. Also so many ads even after just a fresh install. When I used Win10, I saw some candy crush ads on the start menu and Win11 had a ton of app promotions on it. Kubuntu as none of that. I didn't think stock Windows was that pretty and had to manually change each individual icon to make it look good. Customizing Windows was such a pain to do and I always felt more distracted than productive on it.\n But kubuntu, everything somehow feels easier than Windows. Customizing it is so easy and doesn't even require the command line to do so (unless it's more complex stuff like installing a dock). I can install widgets, change my icons, customize my cursor: all this in a streamlined menu. The middle click paste feature, albeit annoying at first, was such a game changer for coding. I feel so much more productive with it because things can get done faster. And all my drives can be ejected with right click instead of 2 different ways for each type. And Dolphin is such a great file manager and makes way more sense than whatever Windows has.\n My PC looks and feels the way I like it and makes me want to use it to get things done: this is how it should be! Before, I wanted to use Mac or wished iPads were powerful enough to code on and only used my pc when there wasn't a mobile option for certain tasks but now I'm happy with my laptop. Linux made me discover a side to PCs I never knew existed!\n    submitted by    /u/FleuramdcrowAJ  \n [link]   [comments]",

I switched because I just couldn't work with Windows anymore. Ads everywhere, they shove that stupid onedrive thing in my face every time I turn on my computer. Slow and unreliable. To be honest, even though there are a lot of problems with Linux, there hasn't been a day I regretted switching. One of the problems is using Linux with an Nvidia GPU. And that's what I want to talk about today.\n I'm an Arch user, I like to build my system to suit my needs, but setting up GPU drivers is something I hate with all my heart. I can't count the …",

          "description": "Last night, I installed the Ubuntu ISO daily build on my Zephyrus G15 2021 model just to see where things are heading.\n The external monitor, connected via USB C > DP, had no issues. Next, I installed Blender and it could use the RTX 3080 without further configuration. So far, so good.\n I was happy to see that Ubuntu still gives us the deb version of Gnome Extensions Manager. Several distros force a ~500 MB flatpak for just that which, for me, is a NO NO. Gimp and several other programs that I need are also still available as a non-snap version. YAY, more room for LLMs and SD models.\n Next, I installed the Battery Health Charging Gnome extension which worked as expected. I then moved the dock to the bottom, centred it and tweaked several Gnome settings.\n For me, 24.04 had problems shutting down and I am happy to say that this seems to be no longer an issue. After using the OS and rendering out some Blender scenes, I am quite impressed and will keep using it.\n https://cdimage.ubuntu.com/daily-live/current/\n UPDATE\n Just switched to zsh because I use it on the other computers.\n    submitted by    /u/fedorum-com  \n [link]   [comments]",

Konsave also lets you share your dot files to your friends in an instant! It officially supports KDE Plasma but it can be used on all other desktop environments too!\n From ME:\n I can't tell you how many times I jacked up my theme, editing my screen, applets, task manager, etc. Spend another 30-minutes trying to get back whatever it was I just screwed up. Well, those days are gone. If you haven't heard there's a nifty python program called konsave that can save your current \"theme\". There's several ways to install it, the konsave website tells you to use python -m pip install konsave to install it. That may work for you. For me on OpenSUSE I had to install python311-pipx using zypper then use the pipx tool (zypper in python311-pipx) to install Konsave. It's usage was the same: pipx install konsave.\n Once you install konsave you can save your current theme information, not just the theme but all the apps, icon locations, icons, cursors, sddm, wallpaper, all of the things that you have customized. Then you can mess around with new theme styles and if you realize you liked the old one better just konsave -a old-saved-theme and get back to where you were.\n Of note you need to be your desktop user, don't use su or sudo.\n If you knew about this, AWESOME. I didn't, and spent the last year without this wonderful tool!\n    submitted by    /u/CryGeneral9999  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hey all! This is my first time posting here, but I've come and gone from the Linux world for a long time. Primarily, I'm a Mac user, but I've always kept Windows around as a compatibility option, and I even dual booted my gaming rig with Ubuntu back in the mid to late 2010s. Well more recently, I've had to switch to Mac more exclusively since a lot of the software I'm most comfortable with for my creative pursuits (podcasting, video editing, etc.) is Mac only (I know there are alternatives to Garageband and iMovie, but they're what my brain likes, and I've learned not to fight that lest I spend more time fighting with new software than creating). I've also been really dismayed by Microsoft's bullshittery these days re: AI and privacy and security. So with an eye to getting away from Windows wherever I can, I decided to dust off my old 2012 Mac Mini, wipe it, and install Ubuntu 24.04 LTS instead. I've then set it up so that its hooked up side by side my M1 Mac Mini on a different HDMI port, with easily swappable peripherals between them. The end result is having both my Mac, and a Linux machine at my disposal whenever needed. This allows me to spend most of my time in macOS, while also being able to easily switch to Ubuntu for gaming of a certain older vintage thanks to the excellent work Valve has done with Proton in Steam. All in all, I'm really impressed with my new setup, and how Linux has basically totally revived and breathed new life into this aging 2012 i5 Mini.\n I present to you, the setup I've affectionately taken to calling the MacStac!\n https://preview.redd.it/cu9e4okdax9d1.jpg?width=2783&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=4ae86322d14ce3da700e1e6d66c059a77fb37511\n    submitted by    /u/Merdy1337  \n [link]   [comments]",

I have my A+ and Sec+ so there was some familiarity with these topics. There was a post on this community that said it’s a good test to take for broadening understanding of various OSs and computers in general.\n My background is predominantly military and emergency services. \n Hopefully this post helps other people on the fence with taking it. Here’s what I did to pass: \n -Printed off the exam objectives from comp tia. \n -made a 3x5 flashcard for every topic using GPT4 to define the topics and relate the topics to windows OS. I made over 600 flashcards this week. ($20)\n -Used an app called IT security to drill questions. It gave me a question deck of 500 questions I paid for this service and answered all 500 questions. ($20)\n I had a raspberry pi as my Linux computer that I would run commands through and learn how the commands work. ($100)\n I can say that I will never use Linux at work since I work in an environment that will never leave windows OS. My understanding of OSs (even windows) is better now and I’m really glad I took this cert. \n    submitted by    /u/Amilliontoads  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "efibootdude · PyPI is a thin layer atop efibootmgr written in python/curses. It is useful because efibootmgr is rather intimidating/annoying to use with very ugly looking output, IMHO. Particularly, if you are a distro hopper, efibootdude aims to help you clean up the mess.\n efibootdude is feature-wise comparable to Elinvention/efiboots: Manage EFI boot loader entries with this simple GUI. But eftbootdude is easier to install (if not in your distro's repo), is more transparent about what it is doing, and tries to report the mount point or device path of each boot loader (to make clean-up easier).\n To try if you wish ... install efibootmgr (if needed), pipx (if needed), and finally run pipx install efibootdude to install. And then run efibootdude with no arguments generally. It looks like this:\n efibootdude v0.5 screenshot\n efibootdude runs well on the systems I've tried (using python11 and python12), but there are a lot of weird BIOSes out there ;-) But, if not working so well for you, create an issue, say, provide the \"raw\" output of efibootmgr, your motherboard/BIOS, and a problem description so I can either generalize or add your case to the caveats ;-) Cheers.\n    submitted by    /u/ZetaZoid  \n [link]   [comments]",

I hope it's not too out of place.\n My dad was a huge linux geek(and computer fan in general) in the early days that it came out. It was his passion in life that he made into a successful career. So much so that while other fathers and sons were playing catch, he was showing me how to use Linux and Unix. I have many great memories of me and him bonding in front of a bash shell. I remember him telling everyone he saw(regardless of if they knew about linux or not) and acting like the proudest father alive when he taught me something as easy as how to cd into a directory when I was 6.\n I remember him religiously collecting stuffed penguins to add to his computer desk. There was a point where he had 10 scattered around and my mom complained that the work area was more penguin than desk. He was a goofy guy who managed to transfer his passions to me.\n Unfortunately, He got diagnosed with an early and aggressive form of dementia(frontotemporal) and ended up not being able to use computers anymore. He's been declining for years now and I've seen him go from the smartest person I've ever known to having the brain capacity of a newborn. He entered hospice two days ago and isn't expected to last much longer. Even through all of the deterioration, He still loves his stuffed penguin and has to have it near.\n I wanted to thank the community for always indulging him and sharing his same passion. This community was always the one that was the kindest to the goofy and eccentric guy who was my father. Truth be told, I can't even look at Linux right now without breaking down. I will in time though.\n    submitted by    /u/MyceliumJoe  \n [link]   [comments]",

The hardware is simply a modern descendant of workstation terminals. It is, for all intents and purposes, a \"terminal\".\n A younger friend insists that this hardware interface is an emulator using graphics and such, and the 'command line program' is a separate application of its own… Did I miss something?

          "description": "This week, we lost one of the great minds of our generation. Daniel dedicated the last 14 years of his life to creating an academic model for real-time threading. This work eventually led to the Linux Kernel runtime verification (RV), providing a practical use case for these models. He authored RTLA (Realtime Latency Analysis tool) that provides analysis of real-time performance and debugging based on models generated from RV. This marked a revolutionary approach to kernel debugging that relied on BPF and tracers to build live models of the current system state, as opposed to the historical method of black-box statically generated system states (i.e., kernel dumps and trace-cmd). \n While his work focused on real-time models, RV's reach expanded to general models of the stock Linux kernel (PREEMPT RT disabled) and successfully replaced tools like trace-cmd and, in some use cases, kdump. Today, I want to not only mourn the kernel legend that he had become but also the man himself. I had the honor of working with him, and the joy he brought into each and every room cannot be overstated. He blended a unique combination of compassion and genius that is rarely seen in the field of computer science, particularly at the level he reached. I will forever miss our casual fireside chats, our light-hearted debates about the best Prosecco drinks, and much, much more. RIP Daniel, you will be deeply missed by everyone in the community.\n    submitted by    /u/bootlesscrowfairy  \n [link]   [comments]",

I'm in the final stages of testing all the installers.\n The application has been out on Windows for a number of years already and I'm well versed in testing that installer (and the MacOS installer URGH WHAT a ballache Apple are) but not so much on Linux.\n I've been testing my DEB package on Ubuntu and PopOS and I'm pretty much done there so I'm looking to test my RPM package. Fedora strikes me as the most obvious choice but wanted to get some input from more experienced Linux peeps on a sound list of distros to test on to avoid any user surprises.\n Same for the DEB package, if anyone thinks I should expand the list I detailed above.\n TIA folks.\n    submitted by    /u/VanillaCandid3466  \n [link]   [comments]",

So now I will let you know how Manjaro felt after a week (actually I should post this in 3 hours xD), hope this post will not get downvoted as the previous one.\n  \nWhat I Liked About Manjaro\n  \nIt's simplicity. It has many graphical tools like pamac, and it's just very user-friendly.\n  \nWhat I Disliked About Manjaro\n  \nTo be honest, nothing.\n  \nDid I Like It More Than Arch?\n  \nI'd have to use it for a loger time to actually say this.\n  \nDid Anything Break?\n  \nNope.\n  \nHow Was the Community Support?\n  \nDidn't need any.\n  \nWere There Any Must-Have Features or Tools?\n  \nOf course, the one I liked the most was pamac.\n  \nOverall Impression and Usability\n  \nVery great, to be honest, if you forget about all the controversies, Manjaro is GREAT, the same goes for Ubuntu.\n Okay, I'm sorry if I made anybody mad by thinking that I will be able to actually say much about Manjaro after using it for a week, I know it's a short time, but I have a big problem with staying on one distro, so I thought that this will actually be enough. Will I stay on Manjaro? For now, no. I wanna get a fresh setup (Ubuntu or Void, I haven't decided yet). But Manjaro was great! Let me know if you have any more questions about the distro.\n    submitted by    /u/ignxcy  \n [link]   [comments]",

I think the hard drive is dying on it because it is so frigging slow! It takes a couple of minutes just to boot up to the Windows login screen. And it's got Windows 10 on it.\n My goal was to put Linux Mint on there for him. All he needs is a browser so he can check on stuff for work. So, I figured Linux Mint would be perfect for that.\n Well, I booted up the USB stick and it actually came up quicker than the Windows Login came up. Meaning, USB Flash drive booted Linux Mint quicker than the hard drive booted the login manager for Windows 10.\n So, I got to looking around in the laptop to figure out what he had in it and then…",

          "description": "Stop me if you've heard this one before; Whatsapp is borderline malware. It is a third party app that somehow manages to grant itself such a heightened level of positions that it is able to override Do Not Disturb settings, which are baked into the OS. Here's a list of other apps that can do this:\n •\n •\n •\n And it has been happening for years. \n Proof 1\n Proof 2\n And I'll let you search for more threads because these aren't the only two. \n I know that we willingly compromise some of our security owning a smartphone in general, however this type of malicious behavior by third party app is where I draw the line. Remember all the outrage about the crazy stuff TikTok can do on your phone? Seems like it's time to put WhatsApp in the same category. \n If you care about your personal privacy and security at all, I suggest removing WhatsApp until Meta / the WhatsApp development team addresses this malicious behavior publicly. They haven't bothered to address it for years now, so I'm not holding my breath, but I'm done rewarding this company's continued assaults on privacy.\n    submitted by    /u/kwest12  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Let me preface this by saying I'm excited about new players in the smartphone market, but there's something about Nothing's approach that rubs me the wrong way. Here's why:\n  \nApple Comparisons Everywhere: Every interview, every tweet seems to be a veiled jab at Apple while giving off \"fake Steve Jobs\" Vibes . It's great to have competition, but constantly comparing yourself to the biggest name is tiring. Focus on what makes Nothing unique and not on gimmicks. \n Misleading Innovation Claims: The transparent back with LED lights (Glyph Interface) is cool, but is it truly innovative? True Modular phones have been around for ages (think Motorola Moto Z) unlike the fake modular CMF phone (see the latest Jerry rig everything video). Phrases like \"breaking new ground\" feel exaggerated. Who can forget the fake and over the top reactions to the first Nothing phone.\n Sustainability vs. Charger Omission: Preaching sustainability while not including a charger in a $200 phone and giving a removable back panel in CMF phone while glueing the battery is a bad look. \n  \nNow, let's look at the competition:\n Apple: Whether you love them or hate them, Apple has a long history of groundbreaking tech (think the original iPhone and the M1 chip).\n Samsung: Pioneering foldable displays is a huge accomplishment, pushing the boundaries of smartphone design.\n Xiaomi: Their focus on powerful cameras and innovative designs like glass backs has made them a major player.\n Google: Computational photography is a game-changer, and Google leads the way in this area.\n So, what has Nothing brought to the table? Right now, it feels mostly like gimmicks. The modular phone claims haven't materialized and Carl Pie had the audacity to say that no one has been doing any innovation in smartphone space in last 10 years.\n P.S. I'm open to having my mind changed! I If you think Nothing is bringing real innovation, share your thoughts below.\n    submitted by    /u/Alarmed_Atmosphere  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I've been in the Samsung Android ecosystem for some time, but I'm tired of Samsung Galaxy not having the ability to have more than one profile on a phone (though they're fine with doing that on their tablets?).\n I want the ability to have a separate work and personal profile, but that's just not possible on any Samsung Galaxy phone.\n I don't want to leave the Samsung ecosystem since I enjoy their products (and I have a Samsung watch and ear buds), but it really doesn't look like adding multiple profile options is something they're going to do.\n But it seems that Samsung Galaxy seems to have the best camera for an Android phone, so I think I'm going to have to choose which one I want more. Having a good camera is also fairly important.\n That being said, it really seems that my only options are either Pixel or OnePlus. Any thoughts? Especially from people who have used the latest models for Galaxy, Pixel, and OnePlus? Or other Android phones I may not have considered?\n Thanks!\n    submitted by    /u/DudeGreen  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "吃了太多的外卖了，这个周末终于想自己做点吃的了。外卖吃过来吃过去就那么几家，就算再好吃的东西，每次都点，每天都吃，总会吃腻的。而且，点外卖又很贵，重油重盐的，吃着很香，但每次吃完都很口渴。\n早上在盒马买了一些菜，最近挺喜欢逛盒马的，东西很多，很齐全，什么吃的零食，各种生鲜一应俱全了，不仅喜欢逛实体店，而且也总在他们家点外卖。干净整洁，而且服务态度很好，东西又很齐全，这谁能拒绝呢？\n今天买了一些五花肉，买了一些猪肚，买了一些辣椒，买了一些蒜苗，花了 50 块钱。中午做了一个炒五花肉，晚上做了个炒猪肚。\n外卖到了后，先把五花肉和辣椒用清水洗了一下，把五花肉切成片状，越薄越好，把锅先涮了一下，烧热它，再倒进去一点点花生油，让油出现沸腾的状态，就可以把五花肉下到锅里煸炒了，煸炒时间可以稍微长一点，把五花肉的油脂给逼出去，一直到肉表面呈现微微金黄色，稍微有一些卷的时候，就继续往锅里放一勺豆瓣酱，上色均匀。\n这时候锅里面已经都是油了，不断地冒着泡泡，我习惯将炼出的油倒掉一部分，太油腻的话身体吃了不舒服，这时候再放入切成段的蒜苗，稍微炒两下就可以出锅了。\n20 块钱的五花肉，差不多有一斤，在厨房忙忙活活的弄了一上午，开开心心的出锅，摆盘，自己做的菜就是香，吹着空调，一边喝着小酒，一边吃着菜，很自在，最后一整个光盘。\n不过晚上的猪肚就成了失败品，由于是第一次做猪肚，经验有些不足，再加上猪肚没有切的很薄，导致嚼不烂，一整盘菜最后就浪费了。\n其实我挺喜欢做饭的，自己挑选食材，自己清洗食材，自己烹饪出来，虽然我的厨艺不是很好，但总觉得自己做的特别的香，记得在之前公司的时候，经常去领导家玩，那个领导自己买一些菜，我有时候也会带一些菜，他租的房子很大，厨房和客厅都很大，很适合做饭，然后把一个小组里的人都叫过去，刚开始有个同事很会做饭，但后面就离职了，我平时在家里就很少做的，记得有一次我清蒸了一条鲈鱼，被我妈一顿嫌弃，说是太淡了，我说你年纪大了，吃淡一点的好，她说不行不行，得去重加工一下。自此，就基本没再家里做个饭了。\n但是那个同事离职之后，我就临危受命，担任了厨师的角色，没想到效果却意外的好，拿手的有两道菜，一个是红烧鸡块，一个是炒五花肉，每次做这两道菜，每次都被不同的人夸赞。吃完之后，几个人就在家里吃西瓜，组队玩游戏，很多个周末都是这样度过的。\n来上海后，一直是租房子的状态，跌跌撞撞的换了好几次房子，有时候会有厨房，有时候没有。上一家租的房子，就是一个原始的大主卧，没有做饭的地方，在那里住了三年了，基本上都是在外面吃或者是点外卖。\n住了太久了，对那个小区很熟悉，想走又不想走，不想走是因为对那些太熟悉了，吃喝玩乐，闭着眼睛都能找到，想走也是因为太熟悉了，这毕竟不是自己买的房子，很熟悉有什么用呢，得去别的地方看一下，了解一下，不是老是困在这个熟悉圈里。\n现在找的这个房子是个老破小，天天要爬楼梯到 6 楼，周围也是有点脏乱差，但是在找的过程中，我却对这个房子的厨房一见钟情，可以说，就是因为这个厨房，我才选择租这个房子的。厨房不大，正对门就是原始的天然气灶台，左边是两个洗菜池，右边是一个很长的台面，抬头是三四个大壁橱，台面下是各种抽屉和柜子，可以说是麻雀虽小五脏俱全。最最重要的是，这个厨房完全属于我一个人。我是很不习惯和别人一起共用厨房，共用卫生间的。搬进来的第一天，我就在幻想着以后在这个厨房里，会做出什么惊天美味，我发现我还是挺爱幻想的。\n但实际的结果是，即使有这么方便的一个厨房，我好像也很少做饭，说自己很忙，没时间，其实都是借口。\n直到上一次食物中毒后，我才又重新开始审视这个厨房，现在早上和晚上都是自己开始做，周末就买点菜，整点花里胡哨的。",

          "description": "2024 ，0715-0721\n收到了 RevenueCat 的周报，居然各项指标都在上涨，但是看 Chart 里的数据并没有这么多的增长啊。不过这周也收到了 Google Play 和 Admob 的六月打款，是近两年最低的一个月了，也可能说明了七月的收入确实有所回升。\n\n本周工作\n极简时钟 Android\n这周在国内安卓市场提交了三个版本的极简时钟，向微信学习，更新日志都是：修复了小问题。\n前两个版本（ 3.0.7 和 3.0.8 ）是为了修复友盟没有统计数据的 bug ，除了华为其他市场都通过审核了，只有华为发现了 App 中还有一处 GP 版的下载链接，所以又提交了第三个版本（ 3.0.9 ），把这个 App 内的链接去掉，改成了国内版极简便签的链接。\n上周也提到了华为给我发了针对 3.0.6 整改的邮件，3 天内不整改就下架。我当夜就修改了官网，按照要求去掉了 Google Play 的下载链接，结果这周还是给我下架了。我提了工单，经过半天的核对，客服维持原判，还是说下架有理。幸好当时 3.0.9 已经提交正在审核中，第二天就上架了。\n3.0 版本在国内上架后就一直没有友盟的统计数据，这让我对于这个全新版本在国内的下载情况一无所知。经过两个星期，终于又能在友盟看到极简时钟的数据了。\n\n极简时钟 iOS\n上周请设计师重新设计了一版 App Store 的商品详情页截图，之前一年多用的是横版的截图，这次设计的是竖版，看看这个区别是否是影响下载量的一个因素。花了大量时间在截图的本地化上，多语言实在是太折磨人了啊！！！\n\n这是我第一次使用 App Store Connect 的「产品页面优化」，也就是截图的 A/B test 。等了三天才有数据的对比结果，目前来看提升效果，有，但不多，再测一段时间看看。\n\nHeal Clock\n这是我们一直以来没怎么提到过的一个小 App ，因为没人下载，也不赚钱，自然也不怎么更新。\n最近 Google Play Console 总发提醒让我给这个 App 升级支付 SDK 和目标 API 级别，看着一堆红色的叹号就很心烦，就只好更新一下。\n上次更新这个 App 还是两年多前……这次提交后，很快啊，被拒了，因为不符合去年出的订阅政策，只好再改。\n\n新 App 进展\n这周代码没写多少，主要还是用思维导图梳理一下各个模块需要做的功能，整理完吓了一跳，没想到居然要做这么多。\n不过，最重要的还是起名字。用 ChatGPT 不仅帮我给这个 App 的各个模块都找到了合适的英文单词，还起了一个简单形象的 App 名称，在 Connect 里新建 App ，这个名字居然没有被占用，lucky ！\n\n其他 App\n极简时钟 GP ，这周只有一天下载量突破了 1000 。事实证明，积极回复用户的评论并不能提升 App 的下载量。\n极简便签的国内安卓市场的下载量马上就要超越极简日记了，日活跃用户是后者的两倍，日启动次数更是后者的三倍，开始计划涨价。\n极简日记 iOS 重新开启了终身会员的购买入口，结果被用户喷了，因为用户感觉被背刺了。\n生活\n健身房黄了，只好自己在家自己练了，除了做做俯卧撑和 Switch 上的 Fitness Boxing ，就是用拉力绳来练一下胸肩背。也好，练完浑身大汗，直接就可以冲澡了。但是，健身 App 的计划彻底取消了。\n\n最近两周看的影视剧：\nDark Matter ，最后感觉没有顶上去，居然还有第二季，不知道还怎么编，3 星\nThe Boys S04 ，水了一整季，最后一集还硬来个翻转，3 星\nFuriosa ，没有上一部癫狂，但是也还不错，4 星\nTetris ，本以为是商战片，没想到还和苏联政府有关系，4 星\n\n最近只做早餐了，做出了不完美的黄油吐司，但也做出了完美的松饼🥞🥞🥞，就是松饼粉有点贵。",

          "description": "使用 go 开发项目多年，了解和使用过不少 go 框架，例如 web 框架有 gin 、echo 、fiber 、iris 、beego 等，微服务框架有 grpc 、go-micro 、kratos 、go-zero 等，无论是 web 框架或微服务框架，当深入了解使用一个框架之后，同类的框架都比较容易上手使用。\n开发一个完整后端服务通常不止只有框架代码，还有 API 设计、数据库、测试、文档、配置、部署和监控等等，如果经常使用 gin 开发 web 服务都知道，由于 gin 过于轻量简洁，从 0 开始搭建一个完整的 web 后端服务还是过于麻烦，需要像搭积木一样拼接成完整的后端服务，达不到预想的一键创建一整套完整的后端服务代码。而使用微服务框架可以创建一整套目录结构代码，还有包含了配置、api 文档、部署和监控等。而在根据多种类型数据的表生成 CRUD api 方面没怎么支持(这不是微服务框架需要考虑的，毕竟使用什么数据库和 orm 由使用者决定)。如果开发一个业务相对简单的 web 服务，通常又不会使用微服务框架。\n我实现一个从项目层级的开发框架目的是能够把以往开发项目经验固化下来，这对于提升个人开发技术水平和解决问题能力具有极大的帮助，从项目层面思考和设计架构，并将其经验应用于其他项目开发中，方便自己和也方便团队开发，在团队协作中使用统一的开发框架可以提高代码的一致性和可维护性，如果团队成员对现有框架有不同的意见和建议，则可能导致沟通成本上升。\n注：这里的项目层级的开发框架是指一键创建包含了 web 或 grpc 框架、常用中间件或拦截器、API 、配置、orm 、测试、文档、部署和监控等等，大多情况只需关心编写业务逻辑代码。理论上从项目层级看，越往项目层设计的开发框架，可以做到自动化会越高，而 web 框架或微服务框架从框架层级设计，自动化程度没那么高，当然可以在框架层级基础上转换到项目层级设计。\n实现的在项目层级的 go 开发框架 sponge 没有从 0 开始，而是选择在 gin 和 grpc 两个基础上设计，因为这两个框架都是比较轻量级，可以定制化程度更高。\nsponge 主要特点：\n内置了丰富的生成代码和合并代码功能，自动化程度更高，减少了大量原本需要手动编写的代码，只需专注于编写业务逻辑代码。\n支持基于 mysql 、mongodb 、postgresql 、tidb 、sqlite 表来生成 CRUD 代码。\n支持在 UI 界面上生成代码，更简单易用。\n支持丰富的 gin 中间件、grpc 拦截器，同时有很好的可扩展性。\n包含丰富的常用的组件，开箱即用。\n⓵基于 sql 创建 web 服务 (gin, gorm 或 mongo)\n⓶基于 sql 创建 grpc 服务 (grpc, gorm 或 mongo)\n⓷基于 protobuf 创建 web 服务 (gin)\n⓸基于 protobuf 创建 grpc 服务 (grpc)\n⓹基于 protobuf 创建 grpc 网关服务 (gin)\n⓺基于 protobuf 创建 grpc+http 服务(gin, grpc)\nGitHub 地址： https://github.com/zhufuyi/sponge\n优秀的开发框架或脚手架有很多，选择适合自己或团队来解决实际问题就是好的选择。",

          "description": "难得小朋友去度暑假了，周末在家独享片刻安宁。想写一些文字，记录所思所想。本来一有空就想写写画画，做一些节录，然而很担心不够深刻，几年后回头看，笑掉大牙，故成文稀少。很多想法都一直在脑子里过了很多遍，也不成文字。\n1 、每个人的性格从小时候起都已初见端倪，我的故事是这样的：大概在我 5-6 岁的样子，有年夏天姐姐的腿骨折了。行动不是特别方便，去哪儿都是爸背着。有天晚上从外婆家回来，天色已晚，我爸背着姐姐、带着我一起回家。由于比较晚我很困，不想走路，按平时爸爸肯定背我，姐姐走路跟着，但是今天姐姐腿脚不方便，只能让我走路跟着。我一万个不愿意，一路大哭，慢吞吞地跟在后面，眼见他们越走越远，我更是大哭不止。爸爸把姐姐送回家，回头来接我。看见我爸的那一刻，我整个人都不依不挠心想：\"你咋才来呀，我都走这么远了, 不行,你必须回去从起点开始背我.\"当然最后的结局肯定是暴打一顿。反复的事情应该发生了好几次，每次揍完依旧这样，直到姐姐的腿痊愈。我想那或许是最初的意难平。\n2 、后面的人生轨迹让我渐渐地收敛，主要的原因是没有那么多\"恃宠而骄\"的机会。后面的路上也有很多意难平的经历，主要表现在==我本可以做到的==的懊悔上。\n3 、三年级以前我写字比较慢，耽误了很多玩耍的时间。自从看见初一的姐姐使用行书写字，我反复打开了新世界大门，语文作业 1/3 的时间就完成了。后果却是我写的字没人认得出，全班写字最差的人。从此语文就是我最大的苦恼。也尝试过好好练字。记忆最深的是，有一年除夕的晚上大冬天还在练字，但姐姐转头就向妈妈告状，\"弟弟又开始乱涂乱写了\"，这些经历给我了巨大的习得性无助。我十分想把字写好，也很努力练习，从三年级到高一，但我都是全班写字最差的，语文老师曾经把我的练习册丢在地上踩了几脚，太差了。那种深深的无助感一直刻在我的心理。直到高二的春节，我去一个亲戚家，他是医生，写的处方非常好看楷书，我就在他的桌子旁边无聊开始模仿他的字。他得空看了我的字说“你控笔可以，但是结构不好，你先按照语文书上的字体结构练练楷体字，慢慢写”。顺便给我说，你的字哪个部分为什么不好，结构要和谐与对称什么的。回去之后我慢慢练，一个春节都在家里练字，感觉每一篇都是我写过的最好的一篇字，那种成就感让我废寝忘食。终于回学校后给了老师和同学巨大的震撼，写字我终于入门了。半年后暑假，突然有一天在家练字，写一篇后，我深深的感叹，我怎么没早发现这些规律，==我本早可以做到的，怎么现在才有点感觉==，要是那样就不会又那么多习得性无助和挫败感。\n4 、大三的暑假，我留在了学校参加 9 月份的大学生电子竞赛赛前培训。计科院与物理学院一起组队参与这次比赛。2 个月的赛培时间学到很多电子和硬件相关的东西，也结识了很多朋友。我们对被院长寄于厚望，因为在模拟赛的时候，我的软件编码能力被让大家眼前一亮。所以我们团队都是奔着一等奖去的。9 月正式比赛的题目是：差分模拟器(好像是)，一共有 3 个小功能。3 天时间，在封闭环境下完成。因为要冲击一等奖，所以我们打算搞完最后一个功能再开始联调测试。很可惜功能完成后，软硬件结合调试的时候，一个功能都没完成。3 个月的时间，空手而归。 平复心情后，我回头看我们的工程。发现只是第一个小功能因为一个小 bug 导致整个项目识别，我那个懊悔。我们本可以拿奖的，如果我的策略没有那么激进，要冲一等奖，我们是稳稳可以拿奖的。==本可以做到的，辜负了大家期望==。\n5 、大学里还有好多本可以做到的事情，因为没有勇气，不敢尝试。比如：去参加软件设计大赛、比如:和宿舍同学多玩一些游戏、比如：和女生大胆地自行车比赛；工作以后也有。有一个关于勇敢尝试的 h 段子记忆深刻：如果你见到漂亮的女生，勇敢地上去就亲，结果嘛有两种：1 、啪(打脸)； 2 、啪啪啪；当然这些都是简单粗暴地总结，我后面逐渐有点总结是：在风险可控的范围里，勇敢尝试。，这样至少不会有==我本可以的==最后连尝试都没发生的遗憾\n6 、这样的总结我觉得可能还不够，意难平或者说难以释怀的避免办法还不够。直到最近我在工作上给大家打绩效、谈奖金后，我终于得出结论。背景是这样的：整个一年大家都比较累，压力大，我给大家一直都是批评的声音，谈绩效的时候大家都有怨言。直到给到大家超出预期的奖金，那些所有的意难平、怨言全部消失。我的结论是：人们都活在预期里，幸福只有预期相关。 \n7 、管理好风险和预期下，勇敢尝试。就不会意难平。",

          "description": "目前这个节点是大三同学的暑假，紧接着到来的就是秋招。目前有一疑惑，特来向各位前辈讨教：\n对于应届生的实习经历，企业在校招中，更看重的是有企业的实习经历，还是有实际的研发能力呢？\n对于校招与社招，企业分别有怎样的期待呢？对于实际研发已经有足够经验，入职可以直接上手开发的应届生，走校招还会比社招更加有优势吗？如果走社招，在薪资等方面会不会更有优势？\n问题背景：\n我的朋友计算机专业大三，之前已有拿得出手的技术类竞赛奖项，技术能力和学习能力都很不错。上学期加入了实验室的一个横向项目，项目是企业的实际研发需求，可以理解为外包给了实验室；在实验室有人带有人指导，本人也觉得确实学到了很多之前接触不到的东西，对于项目相关技术的理解也是渐入佳境的状态。\n目前正面临一个选择，究竟是留在实验室继续项目，还是在暑假/下学期初去企业实习？留在实验室继续项目对于技术能力肯定是还能继续有较大长进的，但是就肯定没有时间实习；去企业实习的话，无疑简历上会更加丰富，但是在企业实习生应该一般很难真正接触研发的核心，甚至不一定能有研发的机会，很多都是打杂性质的工作？如果去实习几个月，反而可能浪费真正提升技术的机会。\n所以想问问各位前辈，企业更加看重实习经历这个经历本身呢，还是更加注重实际技术能力呢？我朋友这种情况应该如何选择呢？\n此外跟朋友聊天的时候，朋友还给出了一个有意思的观点，他说对于真正有技术实力的，走校招可能反而会吃亏。他自己就是技术实力很强的，在杭州某大厂就职；去年校招入职后就直接上手研发，很快的时间就开始负责有难度有深度的技术攻坚了，他们主管原话说是从来没敢让应届生负责过这个事情。但是今年他却很难受，原因是承担了明显不一样的压力，明显不一样的工作强度，但是薪水一批进去的都是一样的，即使他们主管帮他写申请破格处理都没用，原因就是应届生年限没熬出来。所以我们讨论时，说他当时如果走社招，可能反而会好一些；但是也有可能根本没人要这样的简历。\n特地也一起提出来，想听听大家的想法，对于能力很强的应届生，去走社招，企业会是如何看待的呢？",

          "description": "背景\n我在今年四月份的时候从上一家公司离职，在这里我工作了四年，离职前主要是做后端开发的，但是日常已经是各个部分都涉及到了。在我们的直接领导被“优化”我也没有了足够的开发自由度，所以选择离职，选择了全栈开发。为什么第二份工作我会选择全栈？这个我觉得和我离职的这家公司的工作有关系。\n第一个原因是：当时我所在的组开发项目很舒服，时间不紧张，可以留给我们足够的技术调研、设计和开发时间，尤其是开发时间，我们一般都是从头设计开发，不会从 GitHub 上拉一个开源的项目随便改改就用，再加上当时的所有这些事情都是有我主导进行的，所以每次做完一个项目让我都很有成就感，最重要的是我上面提到的被“优化”的负责人真的也是很向着我们，可以让我们拥有最大的自由度。\n第二个原因和我个人有关系，我本身平时喜欢都了解学习一点，包括前端、后端、服务器等知识，那种完完整整的做一个项目并发布的喜悦真的让我很舒服.\n入职后的感受\n入职的算事一家小公司吧，毕竟大厂招聘全栈的比较少，我也没那么厉害。入职后第第一个项目比较简单，也确实是前后端我自己做，也是我擅长的技术栈，Vue+ElementUI+SpringBoot 。\n但是后面的事情就不对劲了，我前发布的主题也提过了，他们把前端都给裁掉了，自然而然的我就充当了他们的前端开发，当然还有后端开发。虽然活都给我了，但是好在开发周期也自然而然的拉长了，只不过我的事情变杂了，电脑经常开的好几个项目的 idea ，来回切换着改。但是他们的开发方式让我不睡很舒服，每次有一个新的项目第一步领导会让从 GitHub 上找一个类似的项目，然后直接拉下来修改，根本没有从头设计的步骤（可能很多公司都这样吧），这种开发方式让我觉得我就是个机器人，告诉我改哪里我就改哪里，至于如何设计的，不重要。\n所以我觉得：在国内，全栈开发工程师就是一个哪里需要哪里搬的全能工具人，至少我现在的公司是这样的，不过我不会妥协的，我还会继续寻找……现在试用期刚过，我又在寻找下一个了，哈哈哈哈",

          "description": "感觉我发像是推广....不过就算是推广吧，自家软件确实还行吧，有不好的地方欢迎大家指出，主要现在产品逻辑还是有些问题，现在也没弄明白到底咋做能做好，帖子其实不单单是宣传产品的，也希望大家给商业和运作模式提一点建议。\n首先介绍下飞鼠的用途。飞鼠主要功能在于异地组网，包括 SDWAN 、单点访问（就是那个啥）和 NAT 组网。帖子主要介绍的是 NAT 组网，其实就是和 tailscale 、zerotier 差不多的应用。实际上也确实差不多，但是在国内的大环境下我们的优化会好一点，比如针对移动经典大内网 NAT4 的打洞，还有中继服务器的速度也比在国外的好多了。至于安全问题，传输的数据是加密的，但是组网的 socks 是明码的，也不算明码吧，稍微加密了一点。Cn 内数据的安全问题本来就是这样的，这个大环境就只能这么做了，单纯的看个电影啥的无所谓，如果涉及敏感的东西，我也建议不要使用我们的产品，或者说国内的产品都不要使用，NAT 组网的初衷就是针对普通的 nas 用户和游戏组网使用的。\n然后是费用，其实个人使用完全没必要交钱。默认是免费支持四个用户的，依次类推每加一个用户一月是一块多钱。。。老板说没想过挣 C 端用户的钱。\n之后是中继速度的问题，这个不存在充了钱的和没充钱的速度不一样的问题。大家都是走一个中继服务器。所以最大上限就是中继服务器的带宽。如果遇到并发使用高峰的时候，中继速度会 QOS 到每个人至少 20M 的带宽，也差不多够了。\n最后是部署教程，感觉也没啥好说的，当时设计的就是让用户注册个账号就能用。我大体列一下流程\nSaas 平台的设置\nSaas 平台主要需要用户完成以下操作：\n1 在 https://www.feishunet.com/#/login 上注册个账号\n2 进入主界面后就能看到前端哥们做的极简风界面了，一共就没几个选项。点那个网络创建，照着填就行，注意别和宿主网络冲突了，组网后会劫持走宿主网络导致没法访问本地内网设备。\n3 然后添加用户，照着做就行。填写完会给个密钥，复制下来。\n4 之后下载客户端。右上角的下载客户端仅限于 windows ，前端好像还没改 linux 的链接，所以 linux 客户端的教程我会放在下面。唉，得催催他。\n5 windows 客户端下载安装打开之后会自动打开浏览器，没错，这个客户端是拿 golang 写的。在经历过几十次包括但不限于炸内存，闪退等奇妙 bug 后，这个客户端已经无懈可击了。应该吧。。。。反正最长测试是大流量传输一百多天没问题，如果出问题，直接在下面攻击我就行。填入密钥点击组网就完成了。\n6 linux 客户端和支持 docker 的 NAS 教程\n首先要有 docker 环境和 dockercompose 。其实也没多少步骤，我列举在下面\n下载 compose 文件\nwget https://dow.feishuwg.com/p2p/docker-compose.yaml\n执行 compose 文件\nsudo docker compose up -d\n好了，结束了，访问你的 nasip：9191 ，和 windows 一样的方法。填进去就行了。",

          "description": "最近上海的天似乎是裂开了，雨一阵一阵的下，不是那种缠缠绵绵的细雨，是中雨，大雨，狂风暴雨。\n晴天，在天快黑的时候，天空会出现一大片的克莱因蓝，整个天际都被它笼罩着，像披了一层薄薄的纱，又像是裹了一层厚厚的布。这层蓝色掉落凡间，成为了精美的工艺品。有时候调色盘打翻了，会出现粉红的晚霞，一大片一大片的，天空也有少女心，它的娇羞展露无疑。随着夜幕完全降临，黑暗笼罩着一切，这蓝色才依依不舍的离开。\n有句歌词叫做，爱就像蓝天白云，晴空万里，忽然暴风雨，但是今天这场雨蓄谋已久。\n先是乌云。抬头不见蔚蓝的天空，只有大片大片的乌云，乌云们比较沉默，它们只是成团成团的聚在一起，走在跨铁路的天桥上，脚下的火车刚刚驶出车站，正在提速，远处的高楼巍峨的矗立在那里，但乌云毫无畏惧，不断地吸收，不断地膨胀自己，黑云压城城欲摧，当你凝视乌云的时候，乌云也在凝视你，大有吞噬一切的决心。\n然后是闪电。似乎是乌云的铺垫已经足够，是时候来点猛的了，一道闪电划破长空，把乌云笼罩的天空撕开了口子， 闪电是粉红色的，它华丽，它迅猛，它快捷，等你反应过来的时候，它已经完成了它的出场秀，直接隐遁起来。它是一条漂亮且暴躁的蛟龙，谁都别想阻拦它的脚步，房屋阻拦它，房屋损毁，碰到人阻拦，人首分离，它的眼里只有毁灭，毁灭，毁灭。这么强悍的闪电只有一个敌人，避雷针。避雷针太了解它了，把能量都吸走，把力量都卸去，还能奈我何？也许是多次吃过这个亏，闪电们不再单打独斗，而是群体出击，一道又一道的闪电接踵而至，依次划破天空，他们准备释放些什么。\n接着是打雷。视觉上的刺激还不够，还有最后一道铺垫，闪电蛟龙离开之后，立刻来了一道擂鼓助威。先是剧烈的轰的一下，整个城区都石破天惊，一下子把人们的注意力都吸走，然后是急促的咚咚咚咚咚的擂鼓，这鼓声沉闷而又有力量，所有听到这鼓声的人精神为之一振。这边的鼓声渐渐变小，直到消失，人们终于可以叹口气，休息一下了，突然又从另外一个方向再次来一道雷声，再次震撼人的听觉，摧毁人的神经。在一遍又一遍的雷声过后，人们心里的防线终于彻底崩塌：快点下雨吧，快点下雨吧，这种听觉实在让人备受折磨。\n冲锋的号角已经吹起，无数颗雨滴化身成为千军万马，哗啦啦直接从刚才闪电撕开的口子降落而下，它们犹如一股洪流，锐不可挡，一鼓作气，直接从万里高空直冲而下，像是铁板一块，坚不可摧，快要降落到地面的时候，却又改变阵型，各自有各自明确的分工。有的雨滴冲向高楼，有的雨滴冲向人群。有些雨滴在高楼坚硬的外表下猛烈的撞击了一下，蹦出一朵美丽的花，然后又继续向下游走，有些雨专挑路上落单的行人下手，把头发打湿，把衣服打湿，嘲笑着他们在雨中的窘迫，只有那些认真打伞，全副武装的人，它们才无可奈何。\n我坐在窗边，看着窗外滂沱大雨，忍不住的在发呆。作为一个小沪漂，以前很不喜欢宅在家里，呆在这个小空间里，觉得压抑，难受，周末总是会给自己找个理由多出去走走，现在年纪大了，什么都反着来了，越来越喜欢待在家里了，尤其是这种大风大雨的时候，越发的觉得心里很安心，很平静。\n写在一个下暴雨的傍晚。",

M2 的 MBP 配置 32GB 的内容甚至更高，可以玩本地的 LLM 和图片生成，不过也可能是伪需求，毕竟增加的钱够买很多线上的服务了。\n请问照片修改需要很大的内存吗？推荐什么配置？\n或者我搞个基础版的 MBP ，然后搞个 PC 主机？",

          "description": "我在 Cloudflare 购买了一个域名，想使用一台 Macbook 远程桌面到家里的 Mac mini 来使用，网上翻了很多帖子，说用 Tunnel 可以实现内网穿透，于是折腾了下，下面是具体的步骤：\n使用家里的 Mac mini ，作为服务端操作如下：\n1 、在 Cloudflare 控制台选择 Zero Trust 新建一个 Tunnel ，并选择 Cloudflared 类型的 Connector ；\n2 、在 Public Hostname Page 中设置了 Subdomain 、Domain 参数，Service 选择了 RDP ，URL 设置为 localhost:3389；\n3 、在 Install and run a connector 的页面，复制安装命令并运行：\nbrew install cloudflared && \nsudo cloudflared service install eyJhIjoiNGNxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx\n\n4 、运行完成后，在 Your tunnels 页面能显示出 Connectors 连接成功。\n然后使用 Macbook 作为远程桌面的客户端，同样使用 brew 安装好了 cloudflared ，并运行如下命令：\ncloudflared access rdp --hostname xxx.xxx.com --url rdp://localhost:3389\n\n输出日志显示启动成功：\nINFO Start Websocket listener host=localhost:3389\n\n然后我使用访达的前往服务器功能，输入：vnc://127.0.0.1:3389进行连接，连接失败，并有如下日志输出：\nERR failed to connect to origin error=\"websocket: bad handshake\" originURL=https://xxx.xxx.com\n\n检查了两台 Mac 的防火墙均处于关闭状态，google 了上面的错误日志看到有说是 Cloudflare 的网络设置中没有打开 WebSocket 导致，也检查了一下是默认开启的，现在不太确定是哪里的问题，不知道有没有小伙伴有成功的案例，不胜感激。",

          "description": "支付历史十多年的美区账号。之前从来没有遇到过类似的情况，无论是用 Balance 支付还是信用卡支付，都一直很正常，直到这次。\n话说用 Android 手机，我最离不开的神器之一，是一个叫 AppDialer 的 App 。这个 App 是买了最初的版本，价格不菲，隐约记得好像 10+USD ，但一直使用了好几年，也算值了。后面因为 Android 系统限制，导致 Widget 的有些功能不能正常使用了，dev 升级后，作为新的 App 发布，需要重新购买，大概得将近 20USD ，一直没舍得。就这么将就着老版本用了小三年。\n这期间，也尝试过一些其他的替代品，包括本站内被人推过的快启动之类的，但还是差点意思。所以，一直还对这款 App 念念不忘。\n最近 Google Play 有个活动，购买 App 可以减 2USD ，我也刚好凑了有 10 来 USD 的 Balance 了，就准备把最新款的 AppDialer 11 买下来。目前这个版本的售价是 13.99USD ，Balance 不够，于是就用信用卡充了 10USD 进去。\n充值的时候支付都很正常，但接下来购买 App 的时候，却提示“Couldn't complete your transaction. Your Play balance can only be used in United States. See the gift card terms of service”\n换了不同的时间节点，在手机端和 App 端都试过了，但都没办法成功支付。\n悲催了。\n另外吐槽一句，不知道为什么这类 App 基本上没有人去做开发，仅有的几个竞品，跟 AppDialer 相比，那体验差距还是很明显的。\n我个人分析，其中一个原因，是绝大多数人压根不知道这类 App 的用处，他们满足于系统自带搜索的毛坯性能。甚至更多的人，压根都不用搜索，要打开一个 App ，都是“退回桌面→划→划→划→戳开文件夹→点开 App”。这就跟一群整天只知道马车的人，很难想象汽车比马要强大好用得多。\n这也同时让我想起关于解锁刷机的问题。很多人买来手机，连系统自带的广告功能都不会关，却津津乐道于，指责别人要解锁要刷机的需求。\n因为，他们压根不知道什么是真正的好用。",

          "description": "Python 潮流周刊从 2023.05.13 连载至今，本周即将发布第 60 期，这意味着我们又要达成一个小小的里程碑啦！\n每周坚持做分享，周复一周，这对自己的精力和意志是一项不小的挑战。于是，为了让自己获得一些仪式感，我给自己定了一个较为合理的时间目标，就是每 30 期周刊作为一季。\n划分出“每一季”，并不是为了像电视剧一样找时间停播休息，而是为了让自己能做一些阶段性的盘点，给读者们分享一些数据、故事和感想，给自己加油鼓气。\n这篇文章并不是周刊第 2 季的盘点，而是一个预告，以及发放一些福利。\n🎁第一重福利\n小报童专栏的限时优惠券，错过就要再等 30 期啦（约 210 天）！\n新订阅者的 8 折优惠券（价值 25.6 元）： 点击领取\n老读者续订的 7 折优惠券（价值 38 元），请在最近几期周刊开头领取。\n🎁第二重福利\nPython 潮流周刊专栏的邀请返利已提升到 50%，当有人通过你分享的海报或者邀请链接，购买了专栏，那么你将获得 50% 的返利（价值 64 元）。\n🎁第三重福利\n第 1 季周刊精华内容出了精美电子书，现在给 Python 猫 公众号发送“W30”，可获取免费下载链接。内容包含 Markdown 、PDF 和 EPUB 三种版本，总字数超过 6.5 万字。\n在第 1 季完结时，我曾将 30 期的精华内容整理成一篇合集文章，也转换成了一本 PDF 电子书。但是当时把周刊内丰富的图片内容都删除了，排版上也非常粗陋。\n这次我不仅将图片都一一加回来了，而且增加了 EPUB 版本，还附上了 Markdown 源文件，应该能提升大家的阅读体验了吧？\n福利介绍完了，接下来再分享几张图吧。\n除了重新整理和排版第 1 季周刊的合集，我还对它做了几个维度的统计分析：\n（ 1 ）第 1 季周刊每一期内容统计\n\n可以看出前面几期的数据波动较大，但后来逐渐趋于稳定。\n（ 2 ）第 1 季周刊每一类内容统计\n\n可以看出我们是以文章和项目为主，而且数量非常之多（约占 90%）。\n（ 3 ）第 1 季周刊的词云图\n\n以上的电子书、图表和词云统计图，其实都是为了做第 2 季内容盘点而顺带完成的，一方面是为了先练练手，另一方面则是将过去有价值的内容再装点一番，让它不至于那么快消失于互联网中。\n最后，预告一下，等第 2 季完结后，我们还会发布第 2 季的精选电子书，敬请留意哦。（专栏付费订阅读者的福利，大家可以提前加猫哥微信为好友，到时领取）",

          "description": "注意标题里的两个 HDR 含义不一样，iPhone 4 相机的 HDR 拍摄是指拍多张曝光不同的照片，再机内合成为一张，使得成片的亮部不过曝、暗处不过黑，这是一种常见的摄影技术。后面的 HDR 是指 HDR 显示，即照片高光部分能以超过 SDR 范围的亮度去高亮显示。\n所以我是说，把 iPhone 4 拍的 HDR 照片放到现在支持 HDR 显示的苹果设备里，高光部分竟是能跟现在最新款 iPhone 拍的照片一样有 HDR 效果的！这个实现原理显然和自 iPhone 12 以来的 gain map HDR 不同，效果也没那么强烈，但的的确确是真实存在的。\n太超前了。\n如果你觉得在手机上看不明显，请使用支持 HDR 显示的 MacBook Pro ，打开相册，找到一张用 iPhone 4 拍摄的 HDR 照片（图片左上角会有 HDR 的标签），然后打开相册设置，反复开关 View Full HDR ，这样你能在 HDR 和 SDR 显示间快速切换。",

          "description": "现象\n最近 CDN 平台下，每天都有新增数十个不同用户的域名受到来自山西太原联通的几个固定 IP 网段的刷流量攻击。\n每天 20:00 左右开始，23:00 准时结束。\n攻击者会事先人为挑选体积较大的静态文件，例如音视频 mp4 、安装包 exe/apk 、体积较大的图片等，然后在攻击期间，不断请求这个文件，消耗流量。\n攻击者会将请求的 Referer 头设置为文件链接本身，User-Agent 则有时是随机的，有时为空。\n其实数月前就有体量较大的用户遇到这个问题，我们封死之后消停了一会儿，\n但最近开始无差别攻击，大站小站只要被它扫到的站，都会在这个时间段内开始高频请求。\n分析\n攻击者似乎并不想要将网站打死，而是慢慢地刷流量，每个域名刷的流量也不多，3 个小时内最多几百 GB 。\n一开始我们以为是普通的竞对行为，后来发现互联网上有蛮多类似案例反馈，来自不同 CDN 厂商平台，在 V2EX 上也看到几个类似的帖子：\nhttps://v2ex.com/t/1055422#r_14960872\nhttps://v2ex.com/t/1045318\n可以认为这个是一个比较广泛的现象。\n另外我们分析这些被攻击的网站的日志，发现攻击开始前的几天内，都会出现一个 153.101.*.* 的 IP （江苏联通） ，使用 Java/1.8.0_91 的 User-Agent 访问被攻击的网站里的资源，我们不确定这是否与攻击有关，但也没查到这是哪家的爬虫信息，也没搜到过前人关于这个 IP 的日志，如果你也遇到了这个攻击，可以检查下日志。\n猜测\n攻击者没有把哪个网站当成必须要拿下的目标，甚至你把它 IP 屏蔽之后，它也不在乎，仍旧到点继续刷同一个地址，即使这个地址会被拦截...\n根据时间、攻击者行为特征，我感觉与 省间结算政策 或者该政策推开后运营商加速封杀高上传家宽（比如 PCDN 之类的）有关系。\n至于到底是运营商自身拉平省际带宽差距的需要，还是政策导致的高上传家宽用户需要拉低上传下载比例来避开运营商的封杀？\n我感觉是后者，观察日志发现，攻击者大部分情况下，请求的还是山西联通网内的 CDN 节点，这是达不到拉平省际带宽差异的效果的。\n为什么要广撒网拿中小网站下手？我感觉是怕流量过于集中引起对方报警之类的，这样每个网站 1~200 GB 分摊下来，对于单个网站主来说，损失不大也不好立案。\n本段所述只是我个人的猜测，未经证实，也未有其它证据佐证，仅供参考。\n应对\n我们监控到异常的 CDN 域名后，会主动屏蔽相关 IP 访问，你也可以尝试屏蔽下列 IPv4 网段：\n221.205.168.0/23\n60.221.231.0/24\n211.90.146.0/24\n\n后续不知道会不会更换 IP ，但如果上述的猜测正确，攻击者自己频繁更换 IP 应该是不利于他所要实现的目的的。\n另外，CDN 端开启限流措施，例如 IP 访问频率限制、流量封顶限制等访问控制功能，也是非常有必要的，可以有效减少恶意攻击产生的流量，也能在发生攻击后尽快提醒你做出应对。",

          "description": "简单来说，就是选定的应用走特定的路由表，达到指定出口的效果，连防火墙规则都不用配置。简单到只需要几个字符的简短命令即可做到。\n比如，我可以在一台 FreeBSD 机器连接上 Cloudflare Warp ，连接时“改道”至副路由表（假设是1 号表）。连接完成后，WireGuard 会在副路由表中把默认路由指向 Cloudflare Warp 的 IP 。这样一来，其它程序都会不会受到影响，继续按照主路由表（即 0 号表）的规则通讯。\n如何使指定程序走 Cloudflare Warp 通道呢？我要 ping 命令走该通道，只需前面加一条 setfib 命令即可：\nsetfib 1 ping -c 10 8.8.8.8\n\n就这么简单。现在 ping 程序就从 Cloudflare Warp 通道出去了。各种联网程序都可以这样做。\n对于开机自启的服务程序，也可以使它们走副路由表。只需要编辑 rc.conf ，给对应程序添加_fib=1后缀即可。就像这样：\nsomesocks_enable=\"YES\"\nsomesocks_fib=1\n\nWireGuard 除外，需要编辑 wg*.conf 加一行 Table = 1 才可以。\n注意：需要先启用 FIB 。\n默认情况下，FreeBSD 只会提供单个路由表，想要启用副路由表就必须自行启用。步骤很简单：\n打开 /boot/loader.conf ，加入一行：\nnet.fibs=2\n\n重启系统。\n现在，0 号表就是默认路由表，我称之为主路由表。其它编号的就是副路由表。\n想要多少个路由表，数值就写多少。只要有需要，net.fibs=100都可以。\n我利用这个特点在 VPS 上连接了 Cloudflare Warp ，将*ray/ss 的流量改成走 Cloudflare Warp 通道，而自己的中转程序继续走默认路由表，达到入口 IP 和出口 IP 都不同的效果：\n利用 FreeBSD 主副路由表(FIB)在服务器使用 Cloudflare Warp\n在这个基础上可以延伸出更灵活的做法，比如同时连上多个 wireguard 隧道，多个 ss 分别走对应的通道，每个 ss 监听不同的端口，中转程序连接不同的端口即可实现动态切换出口位置。比起单路由表+策略路由，这样做的灵活度高了很多。\nPS: 中转程序不一定必须是我链接里的那个，也可以是其它转发程序",

          "description": "原文发布在我的网站上\n难以复刻的大问题\n第一个麻烦是现代框架解决的是“大”问题，而个体开发者遇不上“大”问题\n早些年如果你想从头学习一门前端框架，比如 BackboneJS 或者 EmberJS ，一定绕不开从构建一款 Todo 应用开始，它能让你直观感受到 model 与 view 之间是如何相互协作的。现在我们依然保留同样的传统，只不过它不在以 Todo 的形式存在，但依然会出现在文档的 Quick Start 小节中，企图用最少代码最大程度上展现技术的特性。\n问题在于早些年前端代码只是作为静态站点点缀般的存在，例如控制交互，填充内容——看看这段淘宝平台 09 年的代码你就会理解我在说什么。而如今 JavaScript 代码已经可以做到接管编译、路由、渲染，将应用端到端的呈现出来。最重要的是，它已将处理复杂问题的能力内置其中。然而这些复杂问题，从高并发到匪夷所思的业务场景，Quick Start 里的 demo 无法展现它们的全貌，个体也难以模拟。\nK8S 就是一个最好的例子。\n去年抱着学习的心态，我把我所有部署在 VPS 上的 side project 迁往 K8S ，甚至连应用的部署方式也替换为了 ArgoCD 。但实话实话这不是一笔划算的买卖，因为从结果上看，替换为 K8S 之后花费的计算资源更贵了，维护成本（脑袋里需要记住的东西、涉及到的步骤和需要持续维护的环境）也水涨船高。原因在于当架构简单到仅需单个 cluster 就足以支撑的时候，K8S 的边际成本无法被均摊。所以吊诡的事情出现了，你发现体感上新款 K8S 还不如旧款 PM2 好用。\n可不可以不关心大问题，全权委托给框架，我只管把 kubectl 命令全文背诵就好？——不行，因为 Copilot 永远记得比你滚瓜烂熟。面对 AI 的挑战，程序员无可避免的要将角色从执行者转变为决策者。\n说起来有些玄学，设计…",

          "description": "我应该去年发过一个帖子，主要讨论的是这几年一直在用公司配发的 Thinkpad 笔记本，不敢再将自己的笔记本带到公司去用。原因很简单，现在的企业监控软件实在是太厉害，比如深信服客户端，连微信聊天记录都能监控到，还有定时截屏等等功能\n其实当时还有另外一个很重要的因素没说，那就是钱的问题。\n现在大环境不好，我在我现在的公司呆了四年多了，也就从一个底层员工混到一个业务线研发负责人，最近三年时间里，部门就招了一个新人，没有人离职。\n就业行情真的是太差了，四年多时间里，我自己曾经投过不少简历出去但就面试过两次，一次挂了一次嫌弃地方远没去，仔细说来也基本算没地方可以去了。然后在自己这家公司里，干了四年多，工资也只在去年涨了一千五而已。\n现在的这个行情，我还能继续呆在现在的公司干几年，不好说，但我知道不管是职位还是工资，也基本是到头了。\n因为现在大家都不愿意动，岗位非常的稳定，所以工资也就十分的稳定。甚至因为大环境导致市场缩水，公司这两年做项目也是十分的保守，前几年项目接到手软，我们加班也非常多，但是这两年项目就很稳定，做完这一个才做下一个，加班也很少了。就是这样稳定的情况下，我觉得自己再去投资一台高配电脑，提升自己的工作效率是一件不划算的事情。\n当然了，我自己其实也是一个非常懒的人，下班回家再忙工作或者提升自己再或者自己接私活什么的，也是从来没有考虑的。年龄也大了，没有年轻时的那种冲劲，下班回家就想葛优瘫。\n除了玩游戏就是刷视频看电影。所以我家里使用的电脑就是一台丐版 macmini,接电视当电视盒子用的。曾经还发帖说 8G 内存的 Mac 很好用结果被一堆人喷。\n所以高配 Mac 对我来说基本就是毫无需求。\n我还记得 14 年的时候，我斥资 9 千买下了人生第一台 MacBookpro ，2013late 款，坚信这是一笔非常划算的投资，如今高配 Mac 已然来到了 2 万价位，依然还有很多人在做着这样的投资。\nå2 万其实谁都能拿得出来，但是真正愿意做这种投资并且坚信是值得的，也算是一种本事吧，至少我现在没有这种本事了。",

          "description": "做外包，最近遇到个异想天开的甲方，想预测彩票数字。该甲方自称潜心研究彩票 30 年，一直手算，现在觉得数据量太大了，想用程序实现。\n虽然这个甲方在我看来是异想天开，但是他提出的计算规则倒是没有漏洞，我本着反正只谁出钱谁上帝的原则，实现了出来，但是现在遇到了性能问题。\n他的算法并不复杂，首先，甲方提供了 75 个数字字符串，每个字符串都是 4 个数字，诸如 0123 3578 之类的。我在这里称其为样本数据。\n彩票的开奖数字，每期都是 5 位数字，它的算法里，把这 5 位数字拆开成 5 个，每个单独去和 75 个样本数据进行计算。\n一个样本字符串 + 开奖拆开的数字，会生成一系列值，这些值我接下来会有详述，这就是一行记录(每个生成的值是一列)。\n因为有 75 个字符串，所以就有 75 行，于是，一个被拆开的数字，会生成一张表格，这张表格有 75 行。\n又因为每期开奖数字是 5 位，所以每期彩票的开奖数字最后都会有 5 张表。\n生成值（表格的列）有以下部分：\nA1：找上一期的开奖数字，计算上一期的开奖数字是否在对应行样本数据中出现过。\nA2：当前开奖数字是否在样本数据中出现过？无论出现还是没出现状态，都从当前这期往之前的开奖记录回溯，如果状态和目前这期一致，就累加数值，直到出现一期和当前这一期不一样的状态，就终止(我大致看了一下平均遍历次数在 5 左右)。\nQ15B：从当前期倒退 61 期，然后从此为起点遍历 30 期，只要这 30 期的开奖数字，命中了对应的样本数据，就+1 ，然后获得最终值。如果之前的期数不够，则该数据无效\nQ15R：从当前期倒退 31 期，然后从此为起点遍历 30 期，只要这 30 期的开奖数字，命中了对应的样本数据，就+1 ，然后获得最终值。如果之前的期数不够，则该数据无效\nP15B：从当前期倒退 16 期，然后从此为起点遍历 15 期，要要这 15 期的开奖数字，命中了对应的样本数据，就+1 ，然后获得最终值。如果之前的期数不够，则该数据无效。\nP15R：从当前期倒退 31 期，然后从此为起点遍历 15 期，只要这 15 期的开奖数字，命中了对应的样本数据，就+1 ，然后获得最终值。如果之前的期数不够，则该数据无效，\nP15X：把前面的 A1 ，A2 ，Q15B Q15R P15B P15R 以一个简单的排列规则后得到的分类数。\nQ15X：就是上一期的 P15X （也就是把上一期的 P15X 算一遍出来，所以如果之前期数不够，那么这个数据算不出来\nC618：这是性能罪魁祸首，先不在这里算，问题在下面讲，先跳过。\n就此你可以看到，这个过程从 A1 到 P15R 往前遍历了 1 + 5 + 30 +30 + 15 +15 = 96 次。然后为了算出 Q15X ，又来了一遍，所以遍历了 192 次。问题是，这仅仅是一行（因为是和一个样本字符串在对比），而这个表有 75 行，于是这个循环对比的过程执行了 75 x192 = 14400\n然后我们每期开奖数字有 5 位，也就是说每期有 5 张这样的表，因此是 14400 x 5 = 72000 次。\n这个代码我用的语言是 Java 。循环 72000 次，每一次几乎都进行了对比运算和累加运算，对比运算很简单用的是字符串查找 indexOf 方法。根据我反复测试，程序在预热完毕完毕后，执行上述计算花费时间是 45-50 毫秒。\n45-50 毫秒也不算长啊。本来到这里还没太奇葩的，但是接下来甲方就有骚操作想法了。还记得前面写的那个 C618 吗？甲方的意思是，从目前的这期开奖记录开始，往前倒退 618 期，以此为起点，计算从此开始到当期为止（共 617 期）的从 A1 到 Q15X 的全部值。然后把这 617 的 A1 到 Q15X 和当前期的 A1 到 Q15X 按一定规则对比，比中了就累计值。\n于是上面那计算一次要 45-50 毫秒的操作，要算 617 次。。。算一次 30 秒就过去了。。。\n我想了很久，也没想到该怎么优化这个问题，这妥妥的是 CPU 密集型运算，但是它的算法规则不复杂，甚至可以说相当简单，除了向前追溯的次数太多了之外，整个运算过程几乎的规则就是对比和累计，对比的规则也就是要么查有没有，要么相等不相等。。。\n我一度想看看那个 72000 次花费 45-50 毫秒的过程有没有优化的空间，但是看来看去也不知道该优化哪里。\n目前我暂时不想考虑换语言之类的手段。\n有没有算法大佬来聊聊这个场景该怎么办呢？",

[Yes,/I'm -> Years/are] packed, but not quite ready. I can't find my passport. [Your -> ]    -\n [ -> You] passport? That's the one thing you [mustn't -> must/not] leave behind. I know. I haven't lost it. I've packed [it,/but -> it./But] I [can't -> cannot] remember [which/bag. -> what/it/is.]“\n中括号里的即为你念错的地方。\n\n我的使用方法：\n因为我日常都是去找四六级的听力去练习朗读，因此我下载了全套的历年四六级听力。（也因此需要剪切，每次用 ffmpeg 命令行也挺麻烦的）。\n1.该脚本会先针对你剪好的标准音频进行语音识别，得到文本打印下来。\n2.然后你只需要对着这个文本朗读即可。\n3.最后分析出你哪些地方读错了，哪些地方读的是正确的。\n我的初衷是想做完整朗读中每个单词提供发音百分比置信度的功能，但是当我做到一半的时候，开始写什么 MFCC 音频提取、DTW 算法匹配的时候，才意识到我其实是把简单问题复杂化了。\n日常生活中，大部分人都是不敢说，以及熟悉的单词不会念，能开口实际上就赢了大半，不至于说要每个单词都非常标准发音，这样反而会很奇怪。于是我觉得只要能大声朗读出能让机器识别出来的句子，就能够实现我的目标。至于需要聚焦到更细节的每个单词的严苛发音，我觉得随便一个背单词的 app 就能做到。\n我之前用 chatGPT 对话练习过，但是后面发现很多时候我并不是缺乏对话，而是缺乏开口念英语的连贯性、自然性。我单词都念错了，AI 还能跟我继续唠嗑。读书的时候英语早读课过于注重单个单词的记忆而忽略了完整文章的朗读。如果仅仅是需要找个对话练习，用 chatGPT 就够了。我个人认为这个脚本解决的痛点也是在于：连贯对话的口语纠错。\n\n本脚本也是为了抛砖引玉，肯定有体验更好的方案，希望有大佬如果有兴趣可以开发出来让我使用使用，我这个确实有点简陋。",

          "description": "第一次发帖，如果节点有错还请管理大大帮忙移动下\n先大概介绍下我使用的方案：\n  通过 RouterOS+Surge+SmartDNS 实现客户端无感知分流，ros 将指定客户端的 dns 请求劫持至 smardns ，smardns 对国内域名返回真实 ip ，分流域名返回 fakeip ，同时在 ros 上设置将 fakeip 段路由至 surge 网关，最终实现分流和代理。ros 上对 surge 网关进行监控，当服务异常时会自动关闭劫持。具体可以看我的折腾手记： https://dddafa.notion.site/RouterOS-Surge-SmartDNS-334831ae5792422796cca2f9d4f3ab8d\n为什么使用这个方案：\n  我是使用 apple 生态，surge 各端基本通用的配置文件自然成为了我的首选，一开始我是采用 surge 网关作为 DHCP 服务器后面变成 ros 对指定客户端下发 surge 配置。但本质没有变化。在使用 surge 网关中有一点小问题：\n1 、测速跑不满带宽上限，会低 50Mbps 左右 \n2 、上传测速会变成局域网速率(有可能是测速网的问题，我没有去深究) \n3 、考虑到 surge 网关挂掉的情况,虽然概率比较低但有发现过。 \n所以就开始研究一个更适合我需求的方案，最终发现 dns 分流很适合我，遂开始搭建，后面查阅相关文档发现 surge 网关模式下对所有域名都返回 fakeip ，虽然有 always-real-ip 参数，但貌似官方没有给这个参数引用文件的权限。所以加入 smartdns 作为查询服务器，经过几天的实际使用下来，非常稳定，即使网关挂了 也能自动的切换回正常 dns 不影响国内网站访问。\n不知道诸位坛友们有没疑问或者有什么更加优秀的方案，欢迎探讨",

          "description": "前两次拔牙都是拔完后医生嘱咐顶不住就吃消炎药和止疼药，药也压不住就来急诊或者复诊，这次我灵机一动，我干嘛不手术前就吃。\n于是 12 点多在北大口腔三院取完号后吃了布洛芬和阿司匹林。\n电锯/钻 滋滋作响磨着牙，感觉跟钓鱼佬铁锹挖蚯蚓一样掏啊掏，没有像前两次走出医院就开始逐渐发热、巨疼。分泌的口水血也明显没那么多了。\n坐两小时地铁回去，骑 20 分钟共享电动车，回单位上班跑报修。\n最大的遗憾是每次来看牙一面对医生就迷迷糊糊的，好些都没记住。\n网上一直有说拔牙对女医生不友好，力度不够的话反复拉扯，就算是打麻药了也顶不住这么造。但比较搞的是选择明日挂号看到的空余的都是女医生。好大夫在线、官网之类的能搜到对方信息。有号就挂了，这几天北京也不算特别热。\n右下的智齿横着长了，拍完片后付费上班的医学生没给我拔，只拔了右上的智齿。说下面智齿要先把漏出来的牙磨切掉再把肉下面的牙弄出来，因为靠近神经可能会导致这侧面部麻木，是个大活。他好像是在暗示我不能挂普通号让付费上班的高资带教医学生拔这个牙。\n对比了 A 北京口腔天坛院区普通号、B 北大口腔总院普通号、C 北大口腔三院医师号，觉得比较离谱的是，这三个地方的拔牙后注意事项居然有好几条不重合的。北京口腔天坛院区八个注意事项，北大口腔总院五个注意事项，北大口腔三院十个注意事项] 。\nhttps://imgur.com/a/nP7Rpqv\n没有重合的注意事项有：\n1. A 三日内避免拔牙测咀嚼;\n2. A 拔牙后遵医嘱吃消炎药止痛药，有 XX 情况去综合医院发热门诊消炎退热；\n3. C 拔牙后感觉有硬物存留，可能是残留的碎片或者牙槽骨外落巴拉巴拉；\n最震惊的是，北大口腔三院的医师问我带片子了吗，我说在北大口腔总院拍过你在系统查下，她说查不了。\n得亏我手机拍的有，不然又得重新拍片。\n比较搞的是 抽血验的时候，医生跟挤奶一样双手挤压手肘附近，加速血液流动。让我如临大敌，莫非我还贫血。\nA 电子化最落后，好些要人工，不能自助机挂号取号签到，交单子给分诊台工作人员人工派给医生。\nB 总院最爽，除了完事后得去人工窗口缴费再把一联给医生和取药，大部分都能自助机解决。当时我是牙周复诊，看时间还够就自助机现场挂号开始了第二次拔智齿牙。\nC 就两层，面积不大，不同科室找着不费劲，缺点就是只有二层有卫生间。\n下一步就是找机会做个综合检查看有没有啥隐患。我开始看牙是因为有几天周一侧牙龈肿了影响吃饭说话，硬抗了过去，结果发现牙龈鼓包消不下去，一两个月了还越来越大。 小红书搜了一圈不是买点药吃就能完事的，就去了北京口腔天坛院区，因为他们家有免费初筛，然后建议去看啥科室，最终确定先冲牙消肿解决智齿冠周炎，拔智齿，洗牙刮治割牙龈瘤，在拔智齿。\n各位老哥多关注牙齿卫生健康。",

          "description": "随着工作越来越忙，很少看剧了，最近看了一部《大明王朝 1566 》，又叫做《嘉靖与海瑞》，豆瓣评分 9.8 分。\n历史背景\n公元 1566 年是明朝时期，嘉靖皇帝嘉靖 45 年，这一年嘉靖皇帝去世，隆庆帝继位。\n嘉靖帝是明朝第 12 任皇帝，嘉靖这个年号是从 1522 年到 1566 年。历史上有名的道长皇帝，一生迷信道教，执着长生不老。同时在位期间，20 年不上朝，但是又暗中把持朝政，牢牢控制着朝廷的大权。\n有人说明朝的衰亡就是从他开始，也有人说是他造成了明朝的中兴，为后面的万历改革打下了基础。\n功过是非自有后人和史学家评论，不可否认的是他在位期间，朝廷出现了很多有名的大臣，如夏言，严嵩，严世蕃，徐阶，高拱，张居正，海瑞，对外的将领有胡宗宪，俞大猷，戚继光等等，群星璀璨的时代。\n电视剧\n以上说的都是历史背景，这部电视剧由小说改编而来，自然改编了一些历史事实，比如司礼监这边虚构了吕芳，陈洪，黄锦的一些事，胡宗宪与严嵩之间跳过了赵文华，史书记载严嵩是个身材高挑的大帅哥，而严世蕃是个独眼龙，这也与剧中有所不同。\n电视剧中，嘉靖皇帝迷信修仙问道，将朝中权利一分为三，分别委派给司礼监，以严嵩为首的严党，以裕王为首的清流。三派之间互相争斗，互相制衡，形成三足鼎立的模式，而嘉靖就在其中调停，达到控制全局的目的。\n剧中的每一个人个性非常的鲜明。\n人物\n徐阶\n对于徐阶来说是忍。\n严嵩当内阁首辅，徐阶当次辅，这样的关系已经持续了十几二十年。\n有一集司礼监老祖宗吕芳被临时派走了，二祖宗陈洪当差，而内阁严嵩被告知回家养病，由内阁次辅徐阶行使实际权力。这时候千年老二陈洪一副小人嘴脸，本来在司礼监批红的奏章，直接拿到了徐阶当值的内阁中，并主动对徐阶示好：“不管怎么说，我都比阁老晚一辈，往后只要阁老在内阁当值，我都过这来批红。”徐阶言辞拒绝了陈洪，并对他背诵了那篇韩愈的《祭十二郎文》：“近日，徐某重读…",

Prior versions of npm would also recursively inspect all dependencies. To get the old behavior, use npm --depth 9999 update.\n官网 v7 的说明\nhttps://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v7/commands/npm-update\nThis command will update all the packages listed to the latest version (specified by the tag config), respecting the semver constraints of both your package and its dependencies (if they also require the same package).\n我理解的结论\n意味着 npm 的版本在执行 npm update 时\n<2.6.1：默认会递归更新\n2.6.1-6：默认不会递归，可以使用 depth 指定深度\n>=7：默认会\n\n关于 npm update 是否会影响 package.json 的说明\n官网 v6 的说明\nhttps://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v6/commands/npm-update#description\nAs of npm@5.0.0, the npm update will change package.json to save the new version as the minimum required dependency. To get the old behavior, use npm update --no-save.\n官网 v8 的说明\nhttps://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v8/commands/npm-update\nNote that by default npm update will not update the semver values of direct dependencies in your project package.json, if you want to also update values in package.json you can run: npm update --save (or add the save=true option to a configuration file to make that the default behavior).\n我理解的结论\n意味着 npm 的版本在执行 npm update 时\n<5：默认不会更新 package.json\n5-7：默认会\n>=8：默认不会\n\n请教一下大家，我这这样理解正确么？\n但是我做实验，和我的理解不一样，搞不懂为什么了？\n关于第一点\n我使用 volta install node@8 ，默认匹配的 npm 版本是 6.13.4 ，按照我的理解 npm update 不应该更新包所依赖的包，但是我观察了 pacakge-json.lock ，它更新了，不太理解为什么。\n关于第二点\n同样使用 6.13.4 的 npm ，不会更新 package.json ，也不太理解为什么。\n所以请教一下各位大佬，是不是我看文档的理解有问题？提前感谢大家了，谢谢🙏",

          "description": "周末看到隔壁有个帖子讨论memos，感觉现在不管是官方电报群还是 github issue ，大家普遍对产品的设计思路上（主要是功能变更）或多或少有点不满。\nmemos 作为一款开源软件，我在其仅 700 个 star 的时候就开始部署使用（当时在寻找 flomo 的开源替代品），现在已然是个 28.5k 的知名项目了，这两年已经写了两千多张卡片了。恰逢去年今天，我在毫无 go 语言和前段开发基础的情况下，借着搜索引擎开始魔改开发自己想要的功能，作为魔改一周年的纪念，周末趁着难得的空闲，录了个B 站视频汇总介绍一下这一年的所有魔改。\n搞笑的是，一年过去了，我到现在也还没系统学过 go 语言和前端，仅有一点非专业的 python 知识，但是已经可以非常轻松地在 Github Copilot 和 GPT4 的帮助下去魔改实现我想要的各种功能了，这算是这一年很大的一个收获了。\n比如我现在完全不知道 Typescript ，Vue ，React 这些的差异，问 GPT 的时候也是统称为“这是一段 Typescript 代码...”，或者“帮我用 Typescript 实现...”\n发视频的原因也是因为好奇心想了解下，这些我为自己度身定制的功能，对其他人来说是不是也是好用的功能，因为我经常脑补如果自己是 memos 的官方开发者：如果我发布这些功能会不会也被人吐槽。。。（排除代码写的很烂的原因）",

PixelOS ，优点是尽可能接近 Pixel 体验，但是开发者名言目前版本还不支持自适应刷新率和杜比视界。\n2. LineageOS ，目前标示为非正式稳定版，似乎没有什么明显的功能缺失。\n3. AOSPA （ Paranoid ），暂时没看到其他用户反馈比较明显的 bug ，其他 ROM 的用户反而提到这个 ROM 电池寿命、AOD 等功能很赞。但之前从未刷过这个 ROM ，还是心里没底。\n4. CherishOS ，也是从未刷过的 ROM ，开发者说没什么 issue ，但下面的用户反馈有不少 bug 。\n恳请在用或通过小米 13 各种类原生 ROM 的 V 友，分享一下你的使用体验和建议，感谢！",

          "description": "之前几年一直用的 pdd ，没出什么意外，前几天只是看不惯 pdd 有些行为，想着不能惯着流氓，就试了下 tb 。\n前二天第一次下单，买了些调料和一个小电器，一搜我要的电器牌子，排前面的有个比别家便宜很多的，就是原价差不多，但有个大的优惠券，总价下来 1/3 左右。我当时就想这价不太可能，但因为几年没收到假货了，所以也没放心上。\n到货后，在快递站，因为想着价格因素可能有猫腻，所以我先开箱验货，果然一开箱发现发的货是同品类外形非常相似但牌子和网站说明的不一样，做工一看也很垃圾，当场拒收，并点了只退款。然后显示等待卖家 24 小时内处理，我就走人了（之前在 pdd 也退过小物件，秒退款，但不知道几百元级的小电器类是什么流程）。\n过了二天想起来看看退款情况，24 小时早过去了，但退款单状态变成了“商家拦截快递 商家将在 2 天 xx 时 xx 分处理“，不知道是商家在尽量延长这个时间还是 tb 的只退款流程就这样。\n去看了下这个商品的评论，果然买家发的开箱图片都和商品描述牌子不一样，想在下面评论让后来人别上当，但发不出去，显示“用户信用双零“，好吧，这个 tb 帐号确实是新注册的，确实没有任何办法报复这个店。看了下这个店，只有三个商品，月销过千，保证金 500 元（这么少吗？感觉可以随时跑路新开）\n总结：网上买东西别贪小便宜，大件最好开箱验下货，否则搬回家再回去退太折腾了。",

          "description": "在 3 个月前，我在 V2EX 上首次分享了 PeerBanHelper这个小工具，用来和 hp/torrent 、dt/torrent 进行技术对抗。\n在这之后越来越多的朋友们加入了 PBH 社区，并贡献了许多关键模块和代码，在此对各位为 PBH 做出贡献的人们说声感谢。\n3 个月的更新迭代，现在新推出了 v4.3 版本，除了简单的过滤器，现在更支持伪装检测等等新功能，变化之大我想值得新开一贴再向各位重新介绍一下。\n新增支持的下载器\n在各位朋友的支持下，我们新扩展了两款下载器的支持，分别是：\nDeluge\nBiglyBT (Vuze/Azureus 家族)\n只需要分别安装为上述两款 BT 下载器安装扩展插件(Deluge|BiglyBT)，就可以连接到 PeerBanHelper 了。\n对于还不支持的下载器，可以先使用收集的 IP 规则库，降低影响。\n多拨检测\n感谢 Github 用户 @CharlesChou73 的出色贡献。PeerBanHelper 新版本现在还支持多拨检测，能够有效检测同一 IP 段下的大量异常用户并封禁它们，例如下图这样的：\n\n连锁封禁\n在新的版本里，当特定网段内有 Peers 触发规则被封禁时，它也会连锁封禁同网段下其它的 Peers ，即使它们没有触发多拨检测。\n新的 AviatorScript 脚本引擎\n新版本中全新添加了 AviatorScript 脚本引擎 以允许 PBH 的用户进行编程，编写自定义的脚本，改变 PBH 的行为。\n并由其拓展了两个基于 AviatorScript 的新功能：\nPeerID / ClientName 伪装检测\nPeerID/ClientName 伪装检测可以检测 PeerID 和 ClientName 不对应的客户端，例如 PeerID 是 -TR2770-，但 ClientName 却标注为 qBittorrent/4.2.5 的客户端。\n吸血雷判断\n根据特征判断迅雷是否是吸血变种，在 PeerID 和 ClientName 过滤器禁用迅雷检查后，AviatorScript 迅雷检测脚本就可以开始工作，通过 吸血雷快查表 判断迅雷是否是吸血变种，并只封禁吸血的变种。\n新的 WebUI\n在 @Gaojianli, @XiaoXice 和 @Kaffu-Chino 三位朋友的加入后，PeerBanHelper 的 WebUI 相比上次发帖的版本也获得了质的飞跃。\n除了现在支持通过 WebUI 添加、编辑、删除下载器外，还新增了封禁日志，规则订阅等多个模块。\n下载器\n封禁名单\n封禁日志\n规则订阅\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWindows 安装程序\n之前有朋友提出过建议，在 Windows 上部署困难，现在 PeerBanHelper 也提供了 Windows 的安装程序。和其它的软件一样，双击运行一路下一步就可以安装上了 ;)\n对于 Linux 包管理器和 MacOS 的安装包目前还在研究 install4j 中。这些系统的小伙伴还是要手动装一下 JRE 或者使用 Docker 镜像。\n社区其它内容\n在上次发帖后，PBH 社区也迎来不少 BT 爱好者小伙伴，我们一起建设了一个仓库存放一些可能有用的东西，比如：\nPeerID 速查表 与 @ie12 一起维护的快查表，可以 Ctrl+F 快速查找 PeerID 和客户端对应关系\n吸血雷参考表\n获取 PeerBanHelper\nhttps://github.com/PBH-BTN/PeerBanHelper\n注：gitcode.com 上面的仓库不是我们传的 :(\n最后聊聊别的\n最初编写这款工具的时候，仅仅用于临时目的，并希望这种行为能够随着时间逐渐消失。然而现实是，随着时间推移，这种刷流量的方法似乎正在传播的越来越广。\n在这种情况泛滥后，看到不少朋友决定停止做种/屏蔽整个中国 IP 地址。破坏者为了满足一己私欲，正在波及和摧毁整个国内的 BT 生态（特别是在 IPV6 普及后，难得有所好转之时）。\n希望 PeerBanHelper 能够帮助到那些仍然愿意把互联网精神继续坚持下去的朋友们。不求回报，帮到就好 ;)\n感谢\n感谢这些朋友们，为 PBH 贡献代码，或者参与公共资源编写（排名不分先后）：\n@ie12\n@Gaojianli\n@PluieM\n@zhongfly\n@CharlesChou73\n@DDSRem\n@Ovler-Young\n@BUnipendix\n@Kaffu-Chino\n@XiaoXice\n@azicen",

          "description": "6月27日，暴雪魔兽世界国服停服520天后回归，《魔兽世界》中国官方微博宣布，魔兽世界怀旧服“巫妖王之怒”所有服务器现已开放。此外，魔兽世界正式服也将在8月1日重启，并于8月27日全球同步开启魔兽世界正式服地心之战的资料片。\n\r\n\r\n官方本月早些时候表示，6月27日至7月10日软启动期间，游戏时间将不会消耗，战网商城服务也将无法使用，服务器也将暂时处于锁定状态。7月10日将进行24小时的停服维护，维护完成后，怀旧服“巫妖王之怒”的所有服务就将完全重启，服务器限制也会解除。\n\r\n\r\n我虽然是主要玩《魔兽世界》正式服，但由于正式服还有一个月才上线，因此我就先体验一下这个先上线的怀旧服，玩了几天，感触颇深，下面是我的一点点体验。\n\r\n\r\n服务器硬件和网络体验\n\r\n\r\n我从广东连接魔兽世界怀旧服，显示怀旧服的延迟为23-27ms左右。\n\r\n\r\n我记得最后一次玩国服正式服的时候，延迟只有2、3ms，玩台服的时候，用了加速器，延迟也就20多ms，现在国服怀旧服重开，延迟和台服差不多，新的国服起码在网络延迟上，还是有一些优化空间的。\n\r\n\r\n希望国服正式服上线的时候，延迟能恢复到原来的2、3ms左右。\n\r\n\r\n升级过程体验差\n\r\n\r\n再说一下怀旧服的游戏体验吧，我从1级号开始练级，在有50%经验加成的基础上，从1级升级到80级需要130小时左右的时间。这期间，感觉到了游戏设计师满满的恶意，相比正式服，怀旧服的升级设计简直就是折腾人。\n\r\n\r\n明明可以有个飞行点，就是没有飞行点，从闪金镇到暴风城还要小跑过去，纯粹就是为了浪费玩家的时间。20级才能骑马，60级才能飞行，想想学习飞行需要的金币就头疼。\n\r\n\r\n金币抠抠搜搜就是不给你，学个骑术的3个金币都攒不到，学个专业技能都能把金币花光，对比正式服一个10秒钟简单任务就能赚500金币，对比太强烈了。\n\r\n\r\n怪物等级设计不合理，同等级小怪打起来都难的很，副本更是地狱难度，死亡次数太多了。更绝的是，在副本死后，需要在副本外跑尸，很多副本入口隐藏极深，很难找到入口。为了更多地浪费玩家的时间，设计师专门把副本的任务放在副本外面接，也在副本外面交。\n\r\n\r\n我练的牧师职业异常缺蓝，基本打一个小怪就能把蓝耗光，打一个怪就得坐下喝水回蓝，打一个怪，喝半分钟水，如果不小心add到第二个怪，通常就必死无疑，然后要走很长的路来跑尸，体验非常不好。\n\r\n\r\n在技能方面，怀旧服的很多职业重要技能给的太晚了，导致玩家在早期练级过程极其痛苦，很多技能无法使用，前三十级练级体验很差，之后的体验才慢慢变好。\n\r\n\r\n满级后体验变好\n\r\n\r\n80级满级以后，游戏体验是整个过程中最好的，从PVP和PVE两方面都体验不错。\n\r\n\r\n在PVP方面，国服战场PVP人数很多，2分钟就能排一个40人史诗战场，这在亚服是不可想象的，我在亚服一年多来，从来没有成功排进过1个40人史诗战场，哪怕就是十几个人的小战场，亚服也要15分钟以上才能排进去，而国服这种2分钟就能排一个战场的体验，完全碾压亚服的PVP战场体验。不足之处是PVP战场太少，只有五个PVP战场。\n\r\n\r\n在PVP平衡性方面，某些职业过于强势，职业的平衡性不如正式服，不少职业怀旧服和正式服的玩法大相径庭，例如戒律牧师在怀旧服和正式服几乎是两种完全不同的玩法。\n\r\n\r\n除了PVP，PVE在满级后体验也不错，虽然功能较少，但随机英雄副本基本上5分钟内都能进去，还算是不错的体验。\n\r\n\r\n在装备获取上，通过PVP的荣誉点数和PVE的英雄点数，都可以在短时间内换到不错的装备，让玩家在装备获取上较为轻松。\n\r\n\r\n不过，怀旧服的副本装备拾取机制非常不合理，导致玩家之间容易产生矛盾，绝大多数踢人都是因为装备拾取问题，这点正式服的装备拾取机制完全碾压怀旧服。\n\r\n\r\n结论\n\r\n\r\n怀旧服用户的主要设计特点，是为了更多消耗用户时间来弥补内容相对不足，因此设计出很多恶心人的套路来折腾用户，复杂的世界地图，极少的飞行点，让未满级的玩家痛苦不已，只有满级之后，体验才会慢慢好起来。\n\r\n\r\n正式服用户的主要设计特点是赛季模式，半年一个赛季，装备就会更替，装备和金币获取更容易，设计的主要方向也不再是消耗用户时间了，设计师把主要精力花在怎么让用户更爽，更容易续费的正确道路上。\n\r\n\r\n总之，怀旧服的装备获取难度，金币获取难度，都远远高于正式服，未接触过魔兽世界的新手玩家更应该选择正式服而不是怀旧服。",

          "description": "近日，百度旗下萝卜快跑已经于11个城市开放载人测试运营服务，并且在北京、武汉、重庆、深圳、上海开展全无人自动驾驶出行服务测试。\n\r\n\r\n天眼查App显示，“萝卜快跑”关联公司萝卜运力（北京）科技有限公司成立于2020年12月，法定代表人为毕然，注册资本1000万人民币，由百度2位副总裁李震宇、尚国斌共同持股。对外投资信息显示，该公司直接持股7家企业，其中6家为萝卜运力在各地的科技公司，包括深圳、武汉、合肥、广州等地。知识产权信息显示，该公司已成功注册了多枚“萝卜快跑”、“萝卜优跑”、“萝卜运力”“萝卜快飞”等商标。\n\r\n\r\n作为“人工智能”最前沿的应用之一，不少人认为萝卜快跑无人驾驶汽车正在颠覆和整顿出行市场。\n\r\n\r\n据悉，武汉市已经投入了1000辆萝卜快跑第六代无人驾驶骑车，虽然相比真人司机不够“灵活”，遇到行人、非机动车只会停车等待，但是很多打车出行的市民还是对其给出了好评。\n\r\n\r\n据报道，萝卜快跑累计拿下500万个订单，单车日均单量达到20单，已经和出租车日均单量接近。而且武汉市民对萝卜快跑的乘坐体验评价普遍较高，调查数据显示5分好评占比高达94.19%。\n\r\n\r\n有网友表示，萝卜快跑无人驾驶汽车“空气不臭，有空调，听自己想听的歌，没人打扰，干净”，还有网友表示“武汉真的很需要这种无人驾驶，司机汉骂飙车绕路真的巨烦”。\n\r\n\r\n更能打动人的是价格。4月份萝卜快跑曾推出过2折打车的活动，6公里的路程最低只需要0.8元，相比之下最便宜的滴滴特价拼车也要至少6.9元，经济型网约车一口价10.5元，萝卜快跑价格优势巨大，吸引了不少新用户加入。\n\r\n\r\n价格够低、车内干净舒适，让萝卜快跑成为了不少人的“心头好”。不过对于武汉的出租车、网约车司机来说，萝卜快跑正在威胁到他们的饭碗。有网约车司机表示，无人驾驶汽车对出行行业影响“蛮大的”，如果无人驾驶汽车大规模普及，很多从业者“可能就没饭吃了”，因为无人驾驶汽车成本低，还可以全天24小时运行，但是人开车不行。\n\r\n\r\n一些经常驾车出行的武汉市民也不太待见萝卜快跑无人驾驶汽车，因为其太过“死板”，“拐个弯都可以拐半天”，人类司机调头只需要一两分钟，无人驾驶汽车需要十几分钟，早晚高峰非常容易导致拥堵。\n\r\n\r\n随着萝卜快跑无人驾驶汽车越来越常见，公众对其安全性提出了担忧。7月7日，有网友发视频称汉阳区鹦鹉大道与国博大道交汇路口萝卜快跑无人驾驶汽车与一名行人发生轻微接触，百度方面回应称事故发生时绿灯亮起、车辆起步，行人闯红灯与车辆发生接触，所幸行人无明显外伤。\n\r\n\r\n不过从百度提供的驾驶数据来看，萝卜快跑无人驾驶汽车的安全性已经高于人类司机10倍以上。其安全行驶里程已经超过1亿公里，没有发生过一起重大安全事故，保险出险率仅为人类司机的四分之一。最基本的，无人驾驶汽车不会疲劳驾驶、酒驾、超速、闯红灯，光这几个原因引发的事故每年就接近20万起。\n\r\n\r\n从概率上来说，无人驾驶汽车肯定做不到100%不发生事故，但只要比人类司机事故率低的多就已经足够了。有人担忧无人驾驶汽车会失控，但反过来想，人类司机就一定情绪稳定吗？无人驾驶汽车已经成为新的风口，不少城市争相入局。除了武汉，重庆、北京、广州、上海等多个城市也在开展无人驾驶汽车的试点和推广工作。从这个角度看，无人驾驶汽车对出行行业的冲击还将继续扩大。\n\r\n\r\n网友表示，伴随无人驾驶的大面积普及，“五年后十年后，网约车、出租车基本都是无人驾驶的了，目前的网约车司机、出租车司机都得淘汰。”对于萝卜快跑被指抢网约车、出租车司机饭碗一事，截止发稿百度暂无回应。不过有内部人士透露称，目前百度对于投放于武汉等地的网约车数量并未明确公布，网传萝卜快跑已在武汉投放1000辆的说法暂时无法求证。\n\r\n\r\n来源：综合财联社、新浪科技、金融界汽车",

          "description": "据媒体报道，6月24日下午，苏州日本人学校的校车遭到了一名外来男子的袭击。这一次持刀伤人案件当中，一对日本的母子受伤。还有一个过去阻拦凶手的中国女子，也被砍成了重伤。\n\r\n\r\n对于这件事情，胡锡进发文发表了他的看法。首先胡锡进先是谴责了那个持刀伤人的凶手，说他这样的行为不仅违反法律，还破坏了中日友好的关系。所以不管怎么说，他都支持对凶手进行严惩，让凶手遭受法律的制裁。同时那个阻拦凶手行凶的中国女子应该是见义勇为，值得我们嘉奖。而且她的做法，也反映了绝大多数中国人的善良。在所有中国人当中，大多数人都是善良的，都是会见义勇为的。\n\r\n\r\n以下为胡锡进微博全文：\n\r\n\r\n\r\n老胡谴责苏州持刀伤人者，并有三点基本判断\n\r\n\r\n第一， 老胡谴责苏州发生的男子砍伤三人事件，无论嫌犯是出于什么目的，是不是故意要针对日本人犯罪，我都要谴责他。如果此人行凶针对的就是日本人，我要说，他的这种动机在中国社会中一定是遭唾弃的。互联网上有一些“反日情绪”，但这绝不代表我们的社会支持对在华日本人采取极端行动。绝大多数中国人不仅坚决支持捍卫法治，而且希望中日两国和平友好，加强各种交流与合作，对日本人在华工作、旅游、生活普遍持欢迎态度。而且我深信，这一态度的主流性不可撼动。\n\r\n\r\n第二， 老胡同意中国官方部门的判断，苏州发生的砍伤一对日本母子和一名校车上中国人的事件，它在中国社会总体上就是偶发的，吉林此前发生的一嫌犯刺伤多名美国人事件也是一样。即使这次行凶者是专门针对日本人，其作案动机的形成在中国庞大社会里也是极其零星的。在大秩序和对外国人普遍友好的态度中，这样的个例绝不具有某种代表性，它就是孤立的，是大环境中的偶然。所以在谴责这起作案的同时，不应当夸大它的意义。就像在其他国家和社会里，也都有受害者是外国人的案件发生，其中有个别是专门以外国人为目标一样。不能因为苏州出了这起事件，就做无边无际的延伸解读。\n\r\n\r\n这起事件中，校车上那名中国女子因阻止行凶，受了最重的伤，仍在抢救中。老胡认为，那名女子现场迸发的英勇阻止反映了绝大多数中国人的善良，以及我们对任何行凶的集体态度。\n\r\n\r\n最后老胡想对网友们说，我们大家要了解，目前中国与日本的关系相对紧张复杂，这个时候发生砍伤日本人的事件，比如果中日彼此关系好的时候，会产生更加敏感的效应。因此这个时候不仅法律会严惩凶犯，咱们大家也要在网上亮明我们社会对这一行凶的唾弃，那将有助于扩大国际上对我们社会里主流对外友好态度的了解，更加相信所发生的案件就是偶然的。\n\r\n\r\n\r\n警方通报“日本公民在苏州遇袭”:犯罪嫌疑人已被刑拘\n\r\n\r\n\r\n苏州市公安局苏州高新区分局发布警情通报：\n\r\n\r\n6月24日16时许，苏州高新区塔园路新地中心公交站台发生一起持刀伤人案件，造成3人受伤（其中1人为中国籍，2人为日本籍）。公安局巡逻警力第一时间到场处置，当场抓获犯罪嫌疑人周某某（男，52岁，为近期从外地来苏州无业人员），并立即将伤者送医救治。\n\r\n\r\n目前，中国籍伤者因在阻止嫌疑人犯罪过程中受伤严重，仍在抢救中；1名日本籍伤者正在治疗，无生命危险，另1名日本籍伤者当日已出院。周某某已被刑事拘留。案件侦办工作正在进一步开展中，将依法依规对犯罪行为予以严惩。",
