          "description": "Numscript is a simple, declarative language that helps you model financial transactions. You can do quite a few things with it, such as modeling:\n* Payments involving vouchers and a user's prepaid balance\n* Complex funds destination scenario where the customer gets cash back\n* Configurable user credit balance spending transactions\nThe main idea is to take the pain out of describing of a system dealing with money movements should behave in traditional languages such as JS/TS/Go/Ruby etc, landing an expressive way to model these movements of value.\nIt is voluntarily broad in applicability—our customers use it today for use-cases ranging from marketplaces funds orchestration to home-grown loan management systems.\nOnce those transactions are modeled, they are to be picked up and committed to a system-of-record, ledgering system or executed on a set of payments and banking APIs.\nIt was initially a DSL we bundled into our Core Ledger product at Formance (YCS21) but we're giving it more autonomy now and started to make it standalone, with the idea that anyone could eventually bolt Numscript on top of their ledgering system. We're also exploring to make it natively compatible with other backends.\nAs part of this un-bundling, we've just shipping a playground which lets you fiddle with it without installing anything at https://playground.numscript.org/ (it works best on desktop).\nHappy to chime in on any questions!\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41593216\nPoints: 103\n# Comments: 21",

          "description": "Hi HN,\nWe are Cyril & Ulric and are building Marblism (https://marblism.com), an LLM-based dev platform to generate and iterate on full-stack web apps.\nHere’s a demo video that goes from a comment on Twitter to a working app in 10 minutes: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TapOPO-Gv20.\nMarblism started when we realized that much of the code we write for web apps is just slightly modified boilerplate: similar login flows, dashboards, API integrations, CRUD operations, etc. While AI tools are helpful, they fall short in delivering a well-architected codebase. The idea of Marblism is to combine the best of both worlds: a solid boilerplate, customized and enhanced with AI.\nHere's how it works:\nGenerate your app -  Describe your product, and the AI will build your data model. We create a NextJS app with auth, custom CRUDs, permissions, payment, emails. The AI then generates your front-end pages.\nTest and improve your app - Now that your app is set up, use our online workspace to test your app and add more complex features via an AI Chat or directly yourself in the VSCode editor.\nGo live - Once you’re happy with your app, deploy it in production in one click.\nHere are some examples of apps generated on Marblism in couple of hours of prompting:\nFind and validate startup ideas: https://www.muckbrass.com/\nA design system directory: https://awesomedesignsystem.app.io\nAI-Personalized candle: https://www.scent-a-scene.com/\nMarblism currently generates web apps like SaaS, marketplaces, and social networks. It doesn't support Chrome extensions or mobile apps, and it’s not really for small games like Snake/Tetris.\nThe vision is to add more tech stacks later this year and enable people to create their own templates/tech stack that the AI can customize.\nWe’re really excited to share this with you and we'd love to hear your thoughts on the potential directions we can take this product.\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41568343\nPoints: 81\n# Comments: 58",

          "description": "Hey HN! I'm Caleb, one of the contributors to Opik, a new open source framework for LLM evaluations.\nOver the last few months, my colleagues and I have been working on a project to solve what we see as the most painful parts of writing evals for an LLM application. For this initial release, we've focused on a few core features that we think are the most essential:\n- Simplifying the implementation of more complex LLM-based evaluation metrics, like Hallucination and Moderation.\n- Enabling step-by-step tracking, such that you can test and debug each individual component of your LLM application, even in more complex multi-agent architectures.\n- Exposing an API for \"model unit tests\" (built on Pytest), to allow you to run evals as part of your CI/CD pipelines\n- Providing an easy UI for scoring, annotating, and versioning your logged LLM data, for further evaluation or training.\nIt's often hard to feel like you can trust an LLM application in production, not just because of the stochastic nature of the model, but because of the opaqueness of the application itself. Our belief is that with better tooling for evaluations, we can meaningfully improve this situation, and unlock a new wave of LLM applications.\nYou can run Opik locally, or with a free API key via our cloud platform. You can use it with any model server or hosted model, but we currently have a built-in integration with the OpenAI Python library, which means it automatically works not just with OpenAI models, but with any model served via a compatible model server (ollama, vLLM, etc). Opik also currently has out-of-the-box integrations with LangChain, LlamaIndex, Ragas, and a few other popular tools.\nThis is our initial release of Opik, so if you have any feedback or questions, I'd love to hear them!\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41567192\nPoints: 57\n# Comments: 9",

          "description": "I've been learning about the L4 microkernel, and am thinking about doing something related to it for a research project.  I'm especially curious about more recent examples of specific devices that run L4 variants (seL4, PikeOS, OKL4, etc.).  I already found a few that use seL4, but to take OKL4 as an example, most of the specific devices I could find are from more than a decade ago, and I'm trying to find things from at least the last 5 or 6 years.  I'm even more curious to find devices that use a form of L4 as a hypervisor.\nHas anyone here worked on a device that used an L4-related kernel or hypervisor?  I know one major area they're used in is defense and full of NDAs, but hopefully some of the other industries they're used in (medical devices, automotive, IoT) are a little less restrictive.

Some of our recent hurricane forecasts can be visualized at https://hurricanes2024.silurian.ai/.\nWhat is it worth to know the weather forecast 1 day earlier? That’s not a hypothetical question, traditional forecasting systems have been improving their skill at a rate of 1 day per decade. In other words, today’s 6-day forecast is as accurate as the 5-day forecast ten years ago. No one expects this rate of improvement to hold steady, it has to slow down eventually, right? Well in the last couple years GPUs and modern deep learning have actually sped it up.\nSince 2022 there has been a flurry of weather deep learning system…",

Its inspired by both GraphQL and SQL, but implemented using javascript Proxies. Instead of creating a new language, its all just javascript.\nI've made it as part of an experimental database, which uses javascript as the query engine. The normal javascript map/reduce/sort functions are quite difficult to master for junior developers. JAQT is easier to explain, and can still be used in combination with any existing array functions.\nPlease let me know what you think of the API and its ease of use!\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41554177\nPoints: 80\n# Comments: 24",

          "description": "After working with LLMs for long enough, I found myself wanting a lightweight utility for doing various small tasks to prepare inputs, locate information and create evaluators. This library is two things: a very simple model and utilities that inference it (eg. fuzzy deduplication). The target platform is CPU, and it’s intended to be light, fast and pip installable — a library that lowers the barrier to working with strings semantically. You don’t need to install pytorch to use it, or any deep learning runtimes.\nHow can this be accomplished? The model is simply token embeddings that are average pooled. To create this model, I extracted token embedding (nn.Embedding) vectors from LLMs, concatenated them along the embedding dimension, added a learnable weight parameter, and projected them to…",

Super repairable, of course.

Whenever possible, I’ve been trying to use Claude as a first pass when implementing new features / changes. But I found that depending on the type of change I was making, I was spending a lot of thought finding and deciding which source files should be included in the prompt. The need to copy/paste each file individually also becomes a mild annoyance.\nFirst, I implemented `repogather --all` , which unintelligently copies all sources files in your repository to the clipboard (delimited by their relative filepaths). To my surprise, for less complex repositories, this alone is often completely workable for Claude — much better than pasting in the just the few files you …",

          "description": "Hey HN, we wanted to share our repo where we fine-tuned Llama 3.1 on Google TPUs. We’re building AI infra to fine-tune and serve LLMs on non-NVIDIA GPUs (TPUs, Trainium, AMD GPUs).\nThe problem: Right now, 90% of LLM workloads run on NVIDIA GPUs, but there are equally powerful and more cost-effective alternatives out there. For example, training and serving Llama 3.1 on Google TPUs is about 30% cheaper than NVIDIA GPUs.\nBut developer tooling for non-NVIDIA chipsets is lacking. We felt this pain ourselves. We initially tried using PyTorch XLA to train Llama 3.1 on TPUs, but it was rough: xla integration with pytorch is clunky, missing libraries (bitsandbytes didn't work), and cryptic HuggingFace errors.\nWe then took a different route and translated Llama 3.1 from PyTorch to JAX. Now, it’s running smoothly on TPUs! We still have challenges ahead, there is no good LoRA library in JAX, but this feels like the right path forward.\nHere's a demo (https://dub.sh/felafax-demo) of our managed solution.\nWould love your thoughts on our repo and vision as we keep chugging along!\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41512142\nPoints: 68\n# Comments: 19",

          "description": "Hey Hacker News! We’re Abhi and Alex from deepsilicon (https://deepsilicon.com). We are building software and hardware for training and inferencing ternary transformer models. Here's a video of the software: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqBn-I5D6pk.\nTransformer-based models are getting bigger every generation, making the inference hardware requirements more and more expensive. Running large transformer models on device is even more challenging. Usually, they require trillions of FLOPs to run at decent speeds and use too much energy and space.\nOur solution is to train ternary transformer models. There are two advantages to using ternary values. The first is that the weights can now be stored in two bits (or even less) from 16 bits. This represents an almost 8x compression ratio for every…",

          "description": "Hey HN, this is Lina, Andrew, and Sidney from Infinity AI (https://infinity.ai/). We've trained our own foundation video model focused on people. As far as we know, this is the first time someone has trained a video diffusion transformer that’s driven by audio input. This is cool because it allows for expressive, realistic-looking characters that actually speak. Here’s a blog with a bunch of examples: https://toinfinityai.github.io/v2-launch-page/\nIf you want to try it out, you can either (1) go to https://studio.infinity.ai/try-inf2, or (2) post a comment in this thread describing a character and we’ll generate a video for you and reply with a link. For example: \n“Mona Lisa saying ‘what the heck are you smiling at?’”: https://bit.ly/3z8l1TM \n“A 3D pixar-style gnome with a pointy red hat r…",

          "description": "Hey all,\nI'm the founder of Flipt, an open-source  (https://github.com/flipt-io/flipt) feature flag tool that I (and others) have been working on for the past few years.\nAbout a year or two ago we added support for serving flag state from various non-relational declarative stores like Git, OCI, Object Store, etc.\nMany of our users came to love the git-backed storage, as it allows them to keep their feature flags close to their code in there organization's repos. But they had one (rather large) ask, and that was the ability to use the UI to manage flag state changes and still use Git as the backend.\nSo today we're rolling out our hosted solution that does exactly that (and more soon).\nI would love any feedback, questions, etc, or if anyone would give it a spin! Happy to extend the 14-day trial as well for anyone interested in providing product feedback.\nThanks!!\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41460061\nPoints: 10\n# Comments: 0",

          "description": "Hello, everyone!\nMy name is Alex, and I'm an expat in a new country. Two years ago, I moved to Germany where I didn’t know anyone. Starting the job, I realized that becoming close friends with colleagues can be quite challenging and slow. The feeling of loneliness was gradually growing.\nTo change that, I started attending various meetups based on my interests, hoping to make new friends. However, I often found myself answering the same generic questions that didn’t really help me understand if someone shared my values and interests. As a result, lost energy and 0 friends.\nSO - That’s when I began using icebreaking questions in smaller groups. Surprisingly, these questions quickly changed any conversation to a deeper, more engaging and meaningful level. I was able to identify people I genuinely connected with and started spending more time with them.\nBUT - preparing and using these questions was a pain. I would Google the top-100, pick a random number, and choose a question. I felt a strong need for a simple „one button“ that does everything for me.\nAND - After searching and not finding such a solution, I decided to build it myself. I created a vast database of questions across various topics and integrated AI to generate questions on any subject.\nThe idea has resonated well within my communities (university and expat parties), and more people are starting to use it. I’d love to hear your stories with icebreaking questions, your experience, and your feedback so I can make the service even more useful for more people!\nCheck it out and share your thoughts!\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41438542\nPoints: 17\n# Comments: 6",

Here’s a quick demo: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9n_eY-fM_E.\nWhy we’re doing this: Mechanical engineers excel at generating initial design concepts but get bogged down translating ideas into final designs due to tedious, repetitive tasks. Our goal is to automate these mundane processes, allowing engineers to focus on the creative aspects of design.\nHaving worked at multiple hardware companies—from medical devices to space launch vehicles—we know how often “trivial” components such as manufacturing rigging, get brushed under the table in scheduling conversations.  These tasks aren’t necessari…",

The settings closely follow html/css. We think an open canvas is a big improvement over other website builders. Everything is easier: styling, consistency, responsiveness…\nBut making it work was hard! We thought HN would appreciate the tech behind it:\n- A custom WebGL rendering engine (w/text, shadows, blurs, gradients, & opacity groups)\n- A partial implementation of the css spec\n- A custom text editor & text shaper\n- A transformer to turn designs into publishable html/css\nRepaint is a design tool for html/css.

This is an open source plasmid and vector (Short, often circular segments of DNA) editor, with features related to primer quality checks, PCR cloning, and protein analysis. I plan to add more restriction-enzyme-based features in the near future. It has some extras like a solution-mixing helper, automatic feature annotation.\nFrom a technical standpoint, this is a standalone binary written using the EGUI library in rust. A project goal is performance, with small memory footprint, and small application and file sizes.\nThis is a continuous work-in-progress, and I'm open to any and all feedback, criticism, and requested features.\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41435409\nPoints: 81\n# Comments: 20",

Basically, it wants to solve the problems encountered with current solutions:\n- slow typing\n- not easily configurable\n- keyboard layout dependent\n- constant bugs\nAdditionally, Afrim offers the following features [1]:\n- Dataset easily customizable\n- Keyboard layout independent\n- Auto completion, autocorrection and autosuggestion\n- Support all sequential codes\nTechnical details [2]:\nAfrim is written in Rust and his architecture is inspired of RIME.\nWhat's next?\n- Offer an android frontend of the Afrim (in development) [3]\n- Support more African input methods as possible\nI would like to have your opinions about this project. I have been working on it so far, and I would like to know how I can improve it.\n--------------\n[1] https://github.com/pythonbrad/afrim?tab=readme-ov-file#featu...\n[2] https://pythonbrad.github.io/afrim-man/for_developers\n[3] https://github.com/pythonbrad/afrim-keyboard/\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41427563\nPoints: 80\n# Comments: 33",

          "description": "Hi HN, We're excited to share repo2vec: a simple-to-use, modular library enabling you to chat with any public or private codebase. It's like Github Copilot but with the most up-to-date information about your repo.\nWe made this because sometimes you just want to learn how a codebase works and how to integrate it, without spending hours sifting through the code itself.\nWe tried to make it dead-simple to use. With two scripts, you can index and get a functional interface for your repo. Every generated response shows where in the code the context for the answer was pulled from.\nWe also made it plug-and-play where every component from the embeddings, to the vector store, to the LLM is completely customizable.\nIf you want to see a hosted version of the chat interface with its features, here's a link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNVzmqRXUCA\nWe would love your feedback!\n- Mihail and Julia\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41383592\nPoints: 22\n# Comments: 3",

          "description": "Hello HN!\nMy name is Patrick, and I am a junior at my High School’s FRC robotics team FRC 341 “Miss Daisy” (yes named after the movie). Every year, during the first weekend in January, a new robotics game is released (no it’s not battlebots). The game could be about launching balls into a goal, climbing monkeybars, or placing cubes on a see-saw. This year we were challenged to build a robot that could shoot orange foam donuts into a goal about 6 feet in the air. Here is a yt video with the game animation https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9keeDyFxzY4&t. After we received the game we then had six weeks to design, build, program, and field a robot capable of playing the game. And we did pretty well this year! I have attached a ChiefDelphi thread (robotics forum) where we have released our season materials. This being our CAD (3D model of robot), code, and design binder. I encourage you to take a look and leave any questions that you may have.\nThanks a lot!\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41340874\nPoints: 17\n# Comments: 6",

It’s basically like TurboRepo but without the task runner. The tool builds a dependency graph between packages, allowing you to do things similar to what you can do in TurboRepo, like \"only test the packages and the packages that depend on them, compared to the main branch,\" or \"only install dependencies for Package A and its dependencies,\" etc. I use native go tool to get dependencies and create dependency graph between the package.Nothing crazy but I feel it could be useful.\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41332011\nPoints: 5\n# Comments: 0",

Here’s a quick demo video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bf-xTsDT5FQ. If you want to try it out directly, there are instructions below.\nWith Moonglow, you can start and stop pre-configured remote cloud machines within VSCode, and it makes those servers appear to VSCode like normal Jupyter kernels that you can connect your notebook to.\nWe built this because we learned from talking to data scientists and ML researchers that scaling up experiments is hard. Most researchers like to start in a Jupyter notebook, but they rapidly hit a wall when they need to scale up to more powerful compute resources. To do so, they need to spin up a remote machine and then a…",

For a basic CRUD app you need to spin up servers, wire up endpoints, integrate auth, add permissions, and then marshal data from the backend to the frontend and back again. If you want to deliver a buttery smooth user experience, you’ll need to add optimistic updates and rollbacks. We do these steps over and over for every feature we build, which can make it difficult to build delightful software.

It effectively turns computer programs into Lego bricks, to be torn down into pieces and reused into something new.\nIt supports the COFF and ELF object file formats, for the x86 and MIPS architectures. It has been successfully used on Linux, Windows and PlayStation executables. One user report is on a commercial video game from 2009 with a ~7 MiB Windows executable written in C++: it was delinked without its C runtime library and then relinked into a new executable at a different base address, with no visible change in functionality, as a prelude to a decompilation project.\nUse-cases I've demonstrated on my blog include modding, making software ports, converting executable file formats, creating libraries... I've originally built this as part of a video game decompilation project ; I've been working on this over the past 2.5 years and recently it has started gaining some users besides me.\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41318133\nPoints: 195\n# Comments: 32",

This library offers a foundation for managing hierarchical data structures, supporting items, directories, and symbolic links that encapsulate user-defined types  (generic types defined by the user).

We’re Towaki and Allen, and we’re building Outerport (https://outerport.com), a distribution network for AI model weights that enables ‘hot-swapping’ of AI models to save on GPU costs.\n‘Hot-swapping’ lets you serve different models on the same GPU machine with only ~2 second swap times (~150x faster than baseline). You can see this in action through a live demo where you try the same prompts on different open source large language models at https://hotswap.outerport.com and see the docs here https://docs.outerport.com.\nRunning AI models on the cloud is expensive. Outerport came from our own experience working on AI services ourselves and struggling with the cost.\nCloud GPUs are charged by the amount of time used.

          "description": "Hey everyone,\n IDK if you have the same problems, but I had an idea that might make screen sharing on Linux a lot more secure and private. Picture this: you’re sharing your screen on Discord, OBS, or any other screen share app, and you accidentally reveal something you didn’t mean to—like passwords or private files. It’s a common concern, and I think there might be a way to address it.\n What if we had a feature where you could easily mark parts of your screen as “sensitive,” and the compositor would automatically blur or hide those areas during screen sharing or recording? For example, you could set up certain regions or windows to be censored so that they don’t show up in the recording or stream.\n On top of that, we could take it a step further with machine learning. Imagine having a system that can automatically detect sensitive information—like passwords, IP addresses, or credit card numbers—and blur those parts in real-time. This way, you wouldn’t have to manually mark everything; the system could handle it based on common patterns.\n Does this sound useful to anyone else? I’d love to hear your thoughts or any ideas on how that could work.\n Looking forward to your feedback!\n    submitted by    /u/sporesirius  \n [link]   [comments]",

I could live with a fan if I can throttle the chips because computing power is not a strong requirement for me.\n TLDR: I need an awesome traveling computer as a replacement for the MBAir. I’m weary of everything corporations are doing and want to opt out of the surveillance model, but I’m a sucker for convenience.\n p.s: I love the modern Gnome experience as a decades-old MacOS user.\n    submitted by    /u/choochoomthfka  \n [link]   [comments]",

I wrote this tool which allows you to create a virtual linux device for any of your androids kernel devices.\n Though apart from using android tablet as wacom like external tablet, I can't find any other use cases (maybe you have one ?). Other than useless but kinda cool things like being able to detect when your headphone jack is unplugged, or use your phones touch screen on your linux machine.\n The ux is in need of tlc but I wanted to post about this as I would love for people to test out there own devices.

          "description": "One of the big things I see keeping people from using Linux as their only desktop OS is the unavailability of Photoshop (and other Adobe Products) on Linux. Now granted, I don't really know anything about photo editing or graphic design but based on what I read from people who do graphic design professionally, GIMP just isn't up to snuff as far as features and workflow even with the new 3.0 coming. \n I learned about Photopea a couple years ago and it looks a much better alternative to Photoshop as far as workflow and features (CMYK, smart objects, AI features). The issue I see people might have it with it is it being web based and proprietary though it does edit your photos offline and is big on privacy.\n With all this in mind, for graphic design people wanting to switch to Linux should we be steering them more towards Photopea rather than GIMP despite it being proprietary and web based?\n Keep in mind I ask this as someone who knows next to nothing about graphic design or photo editing, just a huge Linux enthusiast so I would be very interested to hear thoughts from people who know more than me and/or have used both Photoshop and Photopea.\n    submitted by    /u/jmantra623  \n [link]   [comments]",

It’s just annoying. I guess it comes down to security? Would tethered connectivity be easier and more open in Linux? All I want to do is have some basic bare bones software automatically copy certain new files when it’s connected — but otherwise leave me alone :-) with windows it seems like I need special software to accomplish what I want = extra complicated.

I know there also alternatives like the le potato priced at 35 bucks, but is that the cheapest or are there cheaper than that? Im looking for something that acts just like a computer or server similar to the pi, and where might i get said board/tech at?\n Im a 18 year old student who wants to get into some tech and the pi caught my interests but its too pricey, also my parents dont really see a point to a board like the pi, so im curious of how i can convince them to let me get one? if they dont understand it.\n    submitted by    /u/Gaming-invisibleman  \n [link]   [comments]",

Imagine international-level internet outage caused by kernel bug. Linux community would be instantly die after that 😓\n So please stop... stop playing victim on each other.\n For Rust enthusiasts, if you think maintainers who still use C are resisting to give a \"good documentation\", that means they expect you to learn how those C source codes work then write a good Rust code from those. Same as when C devs are tried to learn how to code C based on reverse engineered binaries, or a hardware datasheet if lucky. Nothing is easy, no one want to spoon-feed you except you're a toodler.

          "description": "I've been reading a lot of posts in this sub after the Windows 11's downfall, I truly appreciate those who are recognising the privacy concerns and are trying to make their cyberlife safer.\n With MacOS breaking the limits of how proprietary a proprietary software can be, and Windows being a privacy buster since the release of Win10, there aren't as many options for PC users, except to go for a Linux distro.\n With that in mind, having hundred posts from users trying to move to Linux, asking questions about the most basic necessities to run Linux as a daily driver such as:\n  \nChoice of distro,\n \nChoice of DE,\n \nBest OSS packages for QoL, such as power management for laptops, color adjustment utilities, sound utilities, wireless utilities etc\n \n ...is not optimal. What I think can help will be a community effort to make a one-stop destination for such recommendations. The inspiration for this post came to me after I saw the anime recommendation flowchart in r/anime.\n As a fellow Linux user for the past year, I definitely agree with whoever that says there isn't a one-size-fits-all solution for any of the aforementioned necessities, and the customizability is what gives Linux the advantage. But I also think that it's equally important to bring attention to promising software so that they'll receive more support in the form of issues, feedback and PRs, and it will eventually help improve the Linux experience altogether.\n Ofcourse what I'm implying is a good starter pack, so that the user can slowly try out others as they understand what they feel is lacking in their current software, and give feedback to the software on the way.\n    submitted by    /u/NoCoolSenpai  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I've been testing this program for about a month now and I believe it to be the best drawing tool available (natively) for Linux. However, I very seldom hear any people talk about it - very unknown. \n I find it is the closest Analog you can have on Linux (without fidgeting with Bottles/Wine) to something like Clip Studio in feel and workflow; though not features sadly.\n Krita is still decent but, it has it's own quirks so I always struggle to really use it long term. Linearting just does not feel as responsive on equivalent hardware. Fantastic for Painters though - but lacking for comic and Cellshading styles imo; in big part cause of weak selection and fill tools that I heavily use in such - lack of a \"Gap closing\" function being a big pain in the arse. Paintstorm pretty much solves all of that, I can go about just as fast as in Clip without having to do any manual adjustment.\n Only dealbreaker for some might be that Paintstorm is not FOSS - but well worth the cheap price tag to me. Development is not fast but a couple of updates a year is decent enough.\n    submitted by    /u/Feisty-Pay-5361  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hey everyone, \n A while back, I posted my Arch Linux guide covering full disk encryption with LUKS2, LVM2, Secure Boot, and TPM2 unlocking. For those who haven't seen it, the guide is here: Arch Linux install guide.\n Recently, someone pointed out a vulnerability in the setup that could allow an attacker to mimic the root partition using the same UUID to boot a rogue OS, then query the TPM for the decryption key.\n I've updated the guide with instructions on how to secure against this. If you're using TPM unlocking, I highly recommend checking out the update to make sure you're protected.\n Basically, how the protection works is by using systemd-measure to precalculate the hash value that's expected in the PCR 11 of the TPM during a specific boot phase enter-initrd. The boot process has several phases. And during each phase , the PCR11 is extended with the hash of the new phase. \n Now during boot , during the enter-initrd phase, the TPM checks for other values in PCR 0 , 7. It also checks that the value in the PCR11 matches the precalculated value by systemd-measure, and releases the key. After the enter-initrd phase, comes the switch-root phase. This extends the PCR11 again. Now if an attacker tries to query the TPM from the rogue OS, he will fail, because the PCR11 value doesn't match the precalculated value.\n Thanks to everyone who has supported the guide so far! If you find it helpful, a star on GitHub would be greatly appreciated.\n    submitted by    /u/_d3f4alt_  \n [link]   [comments]",

But for my job, occasionally I need to run full-fledged Word or Excel, and I'm used to PaintNET and Affinity Photo for high quality image editing that I do for publications, I also really like Wondershare Filmora video editor. I am debating which is the best alternative and wondering what other Linux users do in this situation?\n Dual-boot? A hassle having to jump back and forth between the two OS, not to mention having to keep up with Windows updates. I'd rather forget Windows exists as native OS.\n Wine/Proton? As of 2024 it still seems a convoluted process, pollutes your distro with Windows executables and libraries (eww) and of course there are no guarantees the specific app needed will run.\n Local virtual machine? - Not ideal if you are using a laptop on battery often as the performance overhead will drain the battery faster, also it just feels slow and thefore annoying to use.\n Cloud virtual machine? I never tried it before, I wonder what's the performance like, but surely it requires adding a monthly expense.\n RDP into a Windows PC? This is the one I am most inclined to, even though I don't have a separate desktop PC right now, but I tried Parsec to someone else's laptop and it really has low latency streaming if the connection is good, it's quite usable, more so than a virtual machine.\n Any other possibilities I am missing?\n    submitted by    /u/vanwaldi  \n [link]   [comments]",

However, he could not access the screen reader through the installation process which rendered it completely inaccessible to him.\n I did some research and found that Kali has some trouble with the screen reader for the terminal, which people seem to solve by installing and using gnome as default DE. \n I tried to help him remotely, but we haven't had any success. Unfortunately, today I can't videocall him to help with the installation. \n So I came here asking for help: could you reccommend an accessible distro for people who need screen readers? It needs to be accessible since the installation, which can be done via terminal (he knows how to do it). \n Additionaly, if anyone has a tip on how to solve the kali issue, it would be much appreciated. \n Sorry for the writing, english is not my first language.\n Thanks in advance! \n    submitted by    /u/LeiaLemon11  \n [link]   [comments]",

I was also very surprised by the speed and responsiveness of the OS in general.\n This makes me very tempted to switch to Ubuntu as a daily driver, especially as the list of Windows apps and games that are also being developed for Linux, or that work with popular compatibility layers (Wine, Proton, etc.), is constantly growing. Unfortunately, though, I closely rely on Microsoft's Office suite for work with classmates, and after trying LibreOffice, Wine, and the web version of Office 365, nothing compares to the native Windows app.\n What is Linux missing?\n Why are so many people/organizations still relying on an old and outdated OS like Windows?\n How long will it take for people to realize that Linux is the better choice?\n    submitted by    /u/Firm-Garbage-8188  \n [link]   [comments]",

I use two separate drives, and each have their own EFI.\n Windows does this annoying thing, where it will install its EFI stuff in any EFI partition it finds on any disk, even if it's not the disk you want to install to... but I thought of a neat workaround for this that doesn't require \"unplugging your Linux drive\" sorts of fixes... by instead, basically changing your Linux EFI type to something else temporarily, and then back.\n  \nBoot a live Linux distro (eg. Arch installer)\n Change your Linux EFI partition type from EF00 (EFI) to 8300 (Linux Filesystem) using gdisk (gdisk /dev/<disk> -> t (change partition's type code) -> Partition # (probably 1) -> 8300 -> w (write out))\n Install Windows (It won't find an EFI and will make its own on the same disk you're installing to)\n Boot back into a live Linux distro, and change the code back.\n gdisk /dev/<disk> -> t (change partition's type code) -> Partition # (probably 1) -> EF00 -> w (write out))\n  \nThis was helpful for me, as my drive isn't easily disconnectable (NVME), and my bios didn't seem to offer a way to \"disable\" the drive temporarily.

          "description": "One major issue with Linux distributions is that for each piece of software, there's a package for Debian, Arch, Fedora, Ubuntu, etc. Binaries are usually compiled dynamically linked (as opposed to statically linked), which means the libraries aren't contained in the binaries themselves, rather they're linked to system libraries. Therefore, you can't just run a binary from your Arch system on a Debian-based system. Many people say the solution to this issue is Flatpak, Snaps, and AppImages. These don't really address the real problem though. The actual solution is compiling statically linked binaries. This would also make it easier for developers to make binaries for Linux knowing they can be ran on any distribution.\n    submitted by    /u/SaltyMaybe7887  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hey all! Ever since I first discovered Linux, I've been quite interested in it. I like how linux is private and anonymous, unlike Windows. How it's so customizable to your like and taste. I'm not really a fan of Windows, I gotta admit. But so far, the advantages of Windows over Linux still kinda make me hesitant to really make the switch. Yeah, gaming is very doable now thanks to software advances with programs such as Wine and Steam's Proton. But unfortunately, some games still don't run on Linux, or they do, but not flawless. Especially multiplayer games which use anti-cheat software. Unfortunately some or most of them are apparently borderline malware, with how deep they can be nestled/rooted in the OS once installed. I've got an Nvidia graphics card, and though I found out there are linux drivers for them, I'm not sure how good it is compared to Windows. On my pc I've got Nvidia GeForce experience which neatly notifies me when there's a driver update. If I don't get a notification I just don't update. I don't want to manually check for updates every time I boot up my pc. Also I've already got plenty of stuff installed on my pc, and I'm not exactly thrilled if I have to reinstall all of it, if I switch to Linux. So far Microsoft haven't really done anything that I know of that made me determined to switch to Linux.\n    submitted by    /u/SpaceSloth707  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "hello,\n I keep a diary, a very long text file and Linux is wonderful with its scripting abilities for support of it. For example I have a scripts like \"open the diary on the last page so I can write today's entry\" \"insert a header with current date and day of the week for current entry\" \"insert a fortune cookie message of the day taken from the fortune(6) application\" \"open the diary on a pseudo-random page so I can reflect the past\" (this is better than opening a paper diary on a pseudo-random page because you don't involve whether it will be entry from the beginning of the diary or the end) \n all this is done by combining the command line switches and \":r!\" commands in Vim with custom Perl scripts. I don't know how much it will take to make something like that on WIndows, you will probably have to create your own application in Delphi which is cumbersome. \n tried to post this to r/linuxmasterrace but they don't allow text posts, I guess it is OK here, since it involves Linux and Linux is praised\n    submitted by    /u/danielsoft1  \n [link]   [comments]",

Within this time-frame I used mostly openSUSE Tumbleweed and the latest Fedora.\n Well, the first laptop died within 3 years, and had some weird CPU spikes, and resume from suspend was hit or miss. Also I had to deal with broadcom drivers constantly breaking with kernel updates.\n The second laptop had frequent freezes causing the session to hang and require cold reboots. I tried several solutions and kernel parameters but the issue remained to this day. \n The third laptop, with RX dGPU, constantly flickers when connecting to a external FreeSync 144hz display.\n My most recent purchase was finally a Intel laptop with Xe graphics (LG Gram), and behold, I have none of these issues at all. Wayland, suspend and resume, external displays, battery runtime equal to Windows, all works great. It might be just luck with this particular model but honestly it made me regret my past purchases.\n Since then I have learned more about Intel active and timely contributions to the Linux kernel and I am hoping the layoffs won't cause that to decrease.\n Either Intel has been improving a lot these last few years or AMD has been overhyped, but the hassle free experience with a Intel laptop has made me hesitant with going to AMD+NVIDIA on my next desktop build, I am Seriously considering going with Intel CPU+Arc GPU.\n    submitted by    /u/vanwaldi  \n [link]   [comments]",

We did have what passed for high-speed internet access at the time (while living on hot dogs and cheesy mac), so I was able to engage with the community, learn a lot, and work around problems. I even picked up some coding skills! I made some token contributions to various projects. some of it writing code, more of it writing documentat…",

The community seems really cool and it's so fin to mess around with, I consider it my second most used laptop LOL.

Our patented design allows for the camera to be applied directly onto any type of fabric completely accessory-free.\n On the software side, the top action cameras in the market allow you to only stream footage from the device to your app - our app allows to stream the footage from Ucam globally.\n We already have a stellar lineup of investors and advisors, including a former NBA Champion & DPOY, WNBA All-Stars, the CDO of 3Step Sports, one of the Atlanta Dream team owners, and the Executive VP of HoopGroup, to name a few.\n  \nWe're currently seeking a firmware engineer to add to the team.

It was one of the earliest kde 6 adopter and latest kernel is great for how rapidly gaming is growing on Linux. They also do some testing before shipping the updates and it's the default os that ships with their hardware so you can be sure it'll work. Wayland is used by default. Flatpak and nvidia drivers are pre-installed. Snaps are removed (I know they're preferred for servers but majority don't like them on personal computers so this is still a plus).\n What do you guys think about it?\n Edit: They're also KDE patron and organize their events in Tuxedo offices, i think that's pretty nice.\n    submitted by    /u/nikunjuchiha  \n [link]   [comments]",

Linux-based operating systems have existed for decades and have evolved into all possible directions.

          "description": "Hello everyone,\n Just a random thought I had recently. I've been using Linux for awhile now. I switched to linux because of cfd being faster in linux and because of technologies like docker, lxc and chroot. In addition, I had some amazing fun playing with linux on my phone via termux too. I still dual boot windows, but I'm slowly just using linux for most things. So effectively I'm in the windows --> linux camp. I see myself most comfortable with kde and I enjoy themes that compliment that workflow.\n However I've known friends who prefer gnome and use macOS like themes, and not so surprisingly is also from a MacOS --> Linux camp. So this got me thinking, can the choice of someone's preferred DE and theme be a good indication of where they are switching from?\n Please share your thoughts on the matter! Let me know (if you dual boot or fully switched) what OS you used to use before coming to linux and if you have a prefered DE and theme?\n Thanks 🫡\n    submitted by    /u/EternalSeekerX  \n [link]   [comments]",

When I heard all the telemetry news, and when i saw how badly my laptop was taking windows, i had enough. It also helped that I'm a developer and switched to vim/nvim (still not sure which one i like more), and i use git bash all the time. And getting that to run on windows is just a hassle. On linux it's a breeze. Not to mention being fed up with the lack of customization for keybinds and general appearance.\n I spent one day. Backing up all my stuff. And then booted linux mint from a USB. Installed it, fiddled with the drivers/kernels (it still has some graphics/display issues unfortunately :/) and MAN... My Laptop hit record low temps, 50-60° idle, one time i saw even 43°! Everything is so quick to load and work with. Loving the command line way of doing things as well. I love the sense of security and calmness that comes with it all. I just feel at ease again. And i can focus on my work.\n I had to keep windows as dual boot unfortunately because of stuff required by my organizations.

          "description": "I'm pretty new to linux as my daily system and most of my scripting has been used for small work tasks. \n I just installed Pop Os and found the application Komorebi which is used for wallpapers and for my case live wallpapers. I came from windows as my daily driver and used Wallpaper Engine for this and was hoping to find a way to emulate that on my linux machine.\n I didn't want to have to go out and find downloads for videos to turn into wallpapers myself so I build a script that taps into the workshop directory of steam for Wallpaper Engine (installed using proton) and migrates them to Komorebi by making configs and extracting a frame for the thumbnail.\n This allows me to launch the wallpaper engine UI and use it to find wallpapers I want and then migrate them on demand.\n Obviously there will likely be bugs but I'm pretty proud of it.\n I put it up in my public repo and I'm going to continue to improve it where I can. If this is something you're interested in trying here's the link. Included a short video here to show the various wallpapers I pulled into Komorebi from Wallpaper Engine.

          "description": "Hey r/linux,\n Nano is installed on most Linux systems nowadays since it has replaced vi as the default text editor in most distributions for years now. That means most of us are probably using it quite frequently, possibly without even thinking about it when it is called by default (e.g., when using visudo, or when editing a commit message for a git merge operation on a remote host we SSH'd into), but also some of us may be explicitly using it to edit remote config files, editing file as root even locally, or maybe even for programing?\n I actually do use it to program when I'm live coding in front of my students, because I can open it in tmux which allows me to have the same editor on my laptop's screen and on the big display my students see without having to duplicate screen so I can have other notes for myself for example (also, it's good for them to see that it is possible even in 2024 to code using simple tools that runs on your own computer rather that editing files directly on GitHub or wherever…).\n Because of that, I came to realize what an under appreciated gem nano actually is. Recent discussions on HN and here lead me to wonder how to showcase and discuss nano's features, so I thought why not share our .nanorc files?\n I'll copy mine in a comment below :).\n For those of you who never bothered to customize nano, be sure to check the `nanorc` man page, and to not miss its \"REBINDING KEYS\" section which lists the various and sometimes quite advanced editing functions most people ignore that nano has: syntax highlighting, line numbering, auto-indent, multi buffers, mouse support, keyboard macros, …\n So, do you use nano? What for? What does your .nanorc look like if you have one? What is your favorite nano feature? \n    submitted by    /u/p4bl0  \n [link]   [comments]",

So the title is intended as a colloquialism and not so much click bait. In candor, I think this is the tech fad of the month, Linux talk will slow down back to normal and maybe a marginally faster mid term growth. Linux being at 5.2% in 18 months is optimistic, but not unrealistic.\n There is so much pro-Linux and anti-Windows talk in tech communities that aren't even Linux or SOG centric, sure Level1techs made benchmarks, but a lot of other outlets are referencing it. Tom from \"Moore's Law is Dead\" says the Linux Desktop readyness is will be there in 5 to 10 years and we might be there by then and I expect somebody like him to be more skeptical than he was. Tom's Guide (different Tom) installed SteamOS on The ROG Ally X and there was better performance and battery life and DankPods. This is anecdotal, but I follow a variety streamer that I don't think I heard her talk about Linux ever and she tried streaming a Vtuber setup that uses Unreal Engine and heaven knows what and she streamed from the Deck from Proton and it was very choppy and I said \"I think DXVK is compiling shaders and the more you do those effects, the bigger shader cache you'll get and it will stop chopping\". The stream eventually crashed, but considering it's a handheld and it's going through all that translation, I'm surprised it ran that well even though it crashed. She plans on not doing that on the deck until AMD/Valve makes a encoder Driver for Windows.\n    submitted by    /u/commodore512  \n [link]   [comments]",

I cannot imagine myself using windows. Everything is worse and counterproductive. Heck even filemanager doesn't have tabs (as of windows 10) forget about ftp, nfs, sftp, ssh, like dolphin. You can install apps that simulate krunner but its nowhere as good. And not to even mention compiling anything on windows or drivers situation. On linux everything works ootb on windows not so much. Package managers like chocolatey work but they're shadow of what normal package manager is on linux. I had simple qt app that i wanted to compile for windows and after bashing my head against the wall and repeatedly kicking myself in the balls for week i gave up because its simply not possible.\n But hey, games work i guess?

My second time ever trying linux(last time probably 15 years ago, and I gave up). \n It has been completely revolutionary. Finally I can have a almost 90% keyboardbased workflow, not having to deal with terrible laptop touchpads. \n It did take me almost 3 full working days and 2 reinstalls to get it up and running in a proper way. Been fighting with wifi drivers, fixing suspend for closing the lid etc. But it’s finally up and running. Batterytime doubled, runs cool and no fans suddenly spinning for no apparent reason. ChatGPT has been the biggest savior for getting it set up. It spews a lot of garbage and confidently tells you wrong instructions, but for basic setup it seems to hit the mark with a far higher accuracy than browsing rude forum posts from 2009. \n Debian w/ i3 is obviously still terrible at being user friendly, and almost everything is a hassle the first couple of times, but at least you feel respected as a user. \n    submitted by    /u/kunstner0  \n [link]   [comments]",

And, I always hated the screen share here. Even after changing Ozone platform to Wayland in chromium, it crashes after a while. Screen share on Firefox also doesn't work.\n So today, I had to share my screen for work. I just installed i3 and I thought to myself, why not try it in TTY.\n So long story short, I was using Hyprland on TTY1 and then on another TTY, I launched i3 and shared the screen.\n The experience was so smooth. And, I was surprised that I could use multiple window managers without logging out and switching to other. I could just switch between TTYs to use different window managers / compositor.\n I would like to know if there are any problems that could occur from this.\n    submitted by    /u/mashood951  \n [link]   [comments]",

Y'all remember the days when Netflix was a PITA to get working correctly (looking at you, MS Silverlight), gaming on Linux wasn't a thing, I don't remember if Spotify was available for Linux, and a bunch of other stuff SUCKED if you wanted it on Linux.\n During those days, it became very clear to me that Progressive Web Apps (PWAs) were going to be invaluable for my user experience on Linux.

          "description": "Hey everyone! I ran into a funny (and slightly stressful) situation while installing Ubuntu on my Raspberry Pi 5, and I thought I’d share it here. Maybe it’ll help someone, or at least give you a good laugh.\n So, I’ve got a Bluetooth mouse and a Bluetooth keyboard. But, as it turns out, during the Ubuntu installation, they’re pretty much useless because the keyboard won’t connect. I ended up stuck on the screen where you need to enter your username, computer name, and password. And that’s when I realized—without a keyboard, I’m totally screwed. 🤦‍♂️\n After digging through some old boxes, I managed to find an ancient wired mouse—my savior (well, almost). The first steps of the installation, like choosing the language and localization, went smoothly, but then came the part where I had to type stuff… and that’s where things got tricky.\n I started frantically Googling for a solution on my phone, and then I accidentally noticed that I could highlight the text labels in the form fields. Right-clicked, and boom—there were options to “Copy” and “Paste.” That’s when it hit me! I started copying and pasting letters and words from these labels to fill in all the fields.\n One letter at a time, one symbol at a time, but I finally made it through the installation! 😅\n Afterward, I managed to get the Bluetooth keyboard working, and everything was fine. But this experience is something I’ll definitely remember for a long time.\n So, if anyone ever finds themselves in a similar mess—don’t give up! There’s always a way out. And big thanks to my old wired mouse for saving the day. 🖱️\n    submitted by    /u/Ktyby  \n [link]   [comments]",

I used Linux a while back for personal computing, and really wanted to make the switch again. I'm not really a fan of a lot of things that MS is doing (like the forced CoPilot) and figured I would be just a productive on Linux (I chose Kubuntu). Unfortunately, after many hours, I just am not.\n My role is that of an analyst and ad-hoc (not production) dev. For tasks like coding and SQL queries, and our web-based front end tools, Linux is fine. Not really any better than Windows, but not holding me back. However, my org is heavy into the MS ecosystem, and that's where the issues arise. \n Web based office sucks. It's workable for basic word and excel tasks, so I figured I could use that and a VM for more complex tasks. Which I could, but it's nowhere near as seamless as on a Windows machine (where I never work on any Office docs in a browser). Web based outlook kind of sucks, and Thunderbird just doesn't offer the full outlook experience with the multiple calendars and inboxes I have to manage.\n The other issue is I would have to ditch Google Drive.

Please note this tutorial won't work on X11 (I'm pretty sure it should work out of the box on X11 on Intel graphics). This has been tested on Chromium 127, using MESA 24.1.6 on Plasma 6.1.4 Wayland and Fedora 40, using Intel Ice Lake graphics (10th generation). This will likely work for other Chromium-based browsers, like Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge, Opera, Vivaldi, etc.\n All you need to do is to enable the following arguments:\n --ozone-platform=wayland --enable-features=VaapiVideoDecodeLinuxGL,VaapiVideoEncoder --ignore-gpu-blocklist\n On Plasma, you can use the Menu Editor application to add those arguments to the \"Command-Line Arguments\" field (append them at the end), after that, all you have to do is to save your changes and restart your browser. On other desktop environments you might have to edit the Exec line on the .desktop shortcut of your browser, usually located either in /home/your_username/.local/share/applications/ or /usr/share/applications/ (you can use sudo nano /usr/share/applications/browser_name.desktop to edit the files there, or another editor with root support of your choice)\n To confirm it's working, you can install the intel-gpu-tools package for your distribution (sudo apt install intel-gpu-tools on Ubuntu, sudo dnf install intel-gpu-tools on Fedora, and so on) and run sudo intel_gpu_top, then, play a video and check in the terminal if the video usage percentage goes above zero.\n I hope that helps!\n    submitted by    /u/Cleytinmiojo  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "This is a continuation of my HDR on Linux series, building upon setting up HDR on Intel laptops.\n So basically this is a nice handy way to identify YouTube videos that have HDR versions, and open the links in MPV player which can play HDR (no browser supports it on Linux yet). It consists of a Chrome extension, and a Python script. The extension will add a button on YouTube videos which are available in HDR. Clicking this button will launch MPV, which will play the video in HDR. The Python script is the one that actually launches MPV, once it receives a request from the Chrome extension. \n Tested on Manjaro KDE, can work on Gnome too, as long as you are able to get HDR working on MPV, which seems possible\n Installation instructions and guide - GitHub Link\n Enjoy!\n    submitted by    /u/pee_wee__herman  \n [link]   [comments]",

This is found under Settings > Accessibility > Color and motion > Color correction. \n \nExternal display settings - a feature I spotted last month - is now live in Android 15 QPR1 Beta 2! When you hook your Pixel 8 or Pixel 9 series device up to an external monitor, you'll be able to change its display resolution or rotation under Settings > Connected devices. \n \nGoogle has announced that Android 15 QPR1 Beta 2 enables desktop windowing support on tablets like the Pixel Tablet. \n \nAndroid 15 QPR1 Beta 2 enables the lock screen widgets feature on the Pixel Tablet. More details can be found in my article on Android Authority. \n \nAndroid 15 QPR1 Beta 2 now lets you customize the look of the mouse pointer, so you can make it easier to see.\n \n What's in development for later\n  \nThe notification cooldown feature that used to be in the Android 15 preview - the one that stops notification spam - might be coming back in Android 15 QPR1. Here's a first look at its updated page in Settings. \n \nGoodbye Extra Dim, hello Even Dimmer! In Android 15 QPR1 Beta 2, Google is preparing to integrate Android's Extra Dim feature into the system brightness bar, so you don't have to remember to turn it off in the morning anymore.\n \n    submitted by    /u/MishaalRahman  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I have been so frustrated lately with pixel phones and I don't care about the AI crap and debate swapping to iphone. I had my phone rooted for a long time because I like more control over my phone. Google has been slowly eroding that and now I can't even use RCS anymore because my bootloader is unlocked. The only 2 things keeping me here are notifications and firefox.\n Anyways, to elaborate on the headline instead of ranting: Tensor is not great for anyone who wants to do anything with videos. It takes so long to cut the length of a video. And when I was blocking out the kid face it took so long to save that video.\n https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8T7w7mzNqI8 here is a video showing how long it took to shorten \n https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8T7w7mzNqI8 here is how long it took to save.\n It is just really frustrating as when I want to send videos to my family it takes so long to shorten the extraneous parts. iPhones and even qualcomm chips are sooo much faster and I don't know I can in good faith upgrade to a $1,000 phone when performance on an every day task is so terrible.\n    submitted by    /u/rustid  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hello everyone,\n I’ve spent the last two weeks testing my new Chipolo One Point tracker with Google’s new Find My Device feature. I placed the tracker in my car, which was parked in a long-term parking lot at the airport. I was eager to see how often the tracker would be detected. I reported the tracker as missing in Find My Device and waited for a notification that it had been located. Well, I waited the full two weeks, and the tracker was only detected when I was back at my car. \n It was only after this that I researched why the tracker hadn’t been detected even once. It turns out that in the Google settings, the owner of each individual phone must manually enable the option to find trackers and other Find My Device devices. By default, trackers are only found in highly frequented areas, where multiple devices detect the tracker simultaneously.\n The parking lot where my car was parked is visited by a relatively large number of people—most of the parking spaces were booked. Yet, my tracker was not detected even once.\n I wish I had placed an AirTag for comparison. I’m sure the AirTag would have been detected at least once, if not several times.\n I really thought the new Chipolo trackers would be a viable alternative to Apple AirTags.\n Unfortunately, Android trackers are useless to me in this regard.\n    submitted by    /u/Komplexkonjugiert  \n [link]   [comments]",

To me, it feels like faster phones are already offering diminishing returns compared to the speed boosts the latest processor used to give you. \n Am I missing something about faster processors these days?

Thats when I got introduced to this brand with the Redmi Note 9 Pro which I bought lightly used 2.5 years ago for 140$. I was shocked to see that what I did on my 1400$ iPhone actually felt easier on Android even on a cheap phone with low specs. There some huge gaps in terms of camera and snappiness of course but the experience was still a 7.5/10 which for the price difference blew my mind and in fact some features on Android were plain impossible on iOS (custom video players, access to useful open source apps etc.) My previous experience with Android was way back in the day were I bought a Samsung No…",

          "description": "最近一年，在我身上发生了很多事情。最重要的莫过于和谈了一段时间的女朋友结婚了，也买房了。在这之后，各种一地鸡毛的事情也开始接踵而至。双方家庭内部乱七八糟矛盾、夫妻之间的矛盾、原生家庭和小家之间的矛盾、因为房贷而带来的对失业的恐惧….这一切让我感觉都非常地陌生，仿佛一年之前，这些都与我无关。而我的人生轨迹也在这一年被彻底地改变了。 \n最近也一直在想，人生的意义是什么？人为什么而活着？莫非人生来就是为了去读书的苦、在吃工作的苦、婚姻的苦和生离死别之苦吗？ \n让人窒息的原生家庭环境、每次吵架都歇斯底里日渐支离破碎的感情、 越来越糟糕的工作环境…感觉自己才 30 岁不到，就像已经死了一样，心里看不到一点光。有时候很鄙视自己像个生活的懦夫，只知道抱怨….可是我明明已经够努力了，为什么生活还是这么一团糟？ \n以前我很鄙夷那些轻生的人， 毕竟能有什么事情是能够超越死亡的？直到我亲身经历一些事情之后，我仿佛也能理解了。有时候他们可能也只是不愿再去遭受那些让他们感到痛苦的一切。毕竟让我再选一次，我也不会再选择出生、结婚、买房。",

          "description": "2024 ，0909-0915\n这个周记的标题一改再改，因为被拒的次数不断增加。\nGoogle Play 账户验证\n这周一次性通过了 Google Play 的身份验证和银行账户验证。\n之前听闻有的开发者卡在这里好久，提交各种资料就是不能通过。我也害怕这种事发生在我身上，好在没有。就是按照要求提交了身份证、水电费和银行流水，就直接通过验证了。\n\n虽然来自 GP 的收入一直在下降，但是也是目前收入的重要组成的一部分，占到美元收入的差不多四成左右。\n上周有人留言要买我的账号的 App ，向群友请教了一番，结果并不能卖多少钱，连一两特斯拉 Model Y 都不够。算了，还是别杀鸡取卵了。\nShipaton 第五周\n距离截止日期还剩 3 天。\n第五周生产力大爆发，一共完成了 56 个番茄钟，是最多的一周！\n\n因为马上就要到 deadline 了，为了能够顺利提交 App ，不得不又砍掉了一个 Jar Type 。剩余的工作就是 UI 调整，修复 bug ，加入动画和声效以提高交互性。设计师列了几十个 UI 调整事项，还好我很快就完成了大部分，一天发四五个 TestFlight 的 build ，只剩几项我认为比较费时就先搁置了。\nhttps://youtu.be/F12HzTVRrT0\n连续被拒 6 次\n终于，周五下午四点提交了第一版，没想到过了 30 个小时才进入审核。整个周六的精神状态都是心不在焉的，什么都干不进去，总在期待收到审核结果的邮件，然后意料之中地被拒了。第一次被拒的原因还好，只是元数据的问题，填补后顺便修复了一个小组件的问题第二次提交（周六晚上）。\n在等待审核的间隙，完善了 Ship-A-Ton 的各种资料，还第一次用 Rotato 录了一个演示视频。\nhttps://youtu.be/IRKSo2Txclc\n然而，第二次被拒就是周日下午了，直到午夜连着拒绝了五次……\n\n第二次被拒的原因：Paywall 页面里缺少付费后用户得到的功能或服务（我选择的这个 Revenue Cat Paywall 模板没有关于付费解锁内容的配置）。\n第三次和第四次被拒都是同样的原因：说是 Paywall 页面无法加载，影响用户付费体验。但我这个 Paywall 是 RevenueCat 提供的，加载过程不由我控制，RC 的建议就是如果一切配置没问题的话，那就是苹果审核环境导致的，没有其他办法，只能是一遍遍的重复提交。\n第五次被拒的原因：页面存在难以阅读的文字。其实就是 Onboarding 部分的大段文字颜色有些浅，而且在小屏幕的手机上会显示不全。\n第六次被拒的原因有三个：\n付费页面的按钮文案不符合要求，而我这还是借鉴了 Mobbin 发布的关于提高付费转化率的最佳实践。\n付费后遇到错误，我猜是因为 App 销售范围和订阅的销售范围不一致导致的，因为我还没有时间备案，所以第一版就不打算在国内上架了。虽然 App 销售范围去掉了中国大陆，但是订阅的销售范围还是所有国家和地区，这里不一致，另外我也回复给审核人员说这个 App 不在中国大陆销售，请用其他国家的配置环境来审核。\n技术支持 URL 留的网址不符合要求，我本以为用 Notion 搭一个包含隐私政策和使用协议的简单页面就可以了，但是苹果说必须要是能和开发者直接联系的网站才行。\n第七次提交后就马上是午夜十二点了，心情已经麻木和崩溃了，十分沮丧和忐忑地入睡了。我还梦见了第七次被拒，审核员还给我发了一封巨长巨长的邮件，里面罗列了各种素材和命名的截图，说我的 App 抄袭黑神话·悟空……\n还好，没有第七次被拒，一觉醒来，审核通过了！\n我偏要贪图完满，搜个干净\n黑神话·悟空，二周目，白金达成。\n这游戏白金的达成，不是能力问题，也不是时间问题，而是运气问题。\n花了两天在收集各种概率掉落的物品上，感觉我人品还不错，并没有刷到崩溃就收集全了，不过就凭这一点也应该给这个游戏减 0.1 分。",

          "description": "时隔我上个询问民办本科学生出路的帖子已经快一个月，也快中秋了，小弟在此预祝各位 v 友们中秋快乐！\n也是开学了，现在是秋招，而我就读的广东某正学校并没有放人走的意思，计算机类，大数据专业的学生，在大四上居然还有专业课。\n而且找到了实习也不能跑，一周必须回来上课两天，我找了任课老师，辅导员，我的指导老师，基本上给出的答案都是学业为重，不能因为找实习而耽误了学业，但是如今市场下，工作经验不比学校的课程重要的多吗，我是这样想的。\n综上几个苛刻的枷锁绑在身上，又加之民办本科的 buff ，基本上身上没什么选择的机会了，只能说能找到计算机门类的工作都算是幸运的了。\n而大学期间都在忙七忙八其他无关事项的我，并没有去找相关的实习，直到大四的现在，身上如今还是零实习，零项目，并没有过硬的技术，回首网课上学的那一点拿不出手，且没有实操的技术，也是令人唏嘘不已，是的，我把自己前半生玩砸了。\n还好，幸运的是我找到了一个实施实习，是在海珠的 TIT 创意园里的某个医药公司，岗位是实施售后工程师，而且不需要和其他实施一样出差驻场，只要坐办公室吹空调，敲敲键盘就可以了。\n说得好听是售后工程师，实则就是客户使用系统出问题负责售后的师傅罢了，之所以不用出差也是因为对接的都是小药房，和驻场大企业不同。\n当时说是六点下班，而且有双休，我说了我学校的情况每周得有两天上课，也就是只能出勤三天，这公司负责面试我的组长也答应了，这个组长人也挺好的，没啥架子，很平和很宽容。\n我也以为自己能够一直干下去，但是由于寄宿于天河同学家的我每天通勤都得一个多小时，而且并没有准时下班，这几天都是晚上八九点才下班。\n明天是中秋假期了，今晚处理工单的老员工都跑得差不多，俩值班一线人员只有我和另外一个一起刚来的实习生，二线的只有一位姐姐。我处理到了九点多，没有吃饭，到最后，我的疲惫和积攒的劳累终于爆发，我很想很想逃离......\n各位 v 友，感谢你们能够看到这里，我现在很累，澡还没洗，刚过完饭，很想一觉睡在地板上，但是我还是得我想问，我的路该怎么走？\n是我太矫情了吗，客观来看这工作对于我这种人来说明明已经是一个很好的机会，同事也都是年轻的毕业生，他们大多也都做了一个月两个月，为什么我就不行？我就如此困顿？\n从学校到天河这边住宿也得三个小时的地铁公交，从住所到公司又是一个多小时的通勤，是因为通勤搞得我太累了吗，还是因为我没有吃过苦，仍旧是未经世事的学生心态呢？\n我入职的这个岗位是否有前景（对于我这种没学历没技术的人来说），我是否应该做下去，上个帖子很多 v 友建议我考研，最终权衡之后我还是放弃了这个方向，不是因为路不好，而更多是对我自己的不信任，我要是真有底子，就不至于读个民办了。\n我此时此刻真的很想放松一下，我是个爱打游戏的人，但是从上次的挫折我已经很久没正儿八经玩过游戏了，我怀念那种当时不以为然的日子......\n但我还是想再在这个土壤里卷一下，只求能够有朝一日润到某个发达国家，干着闲散活也能轻松养活自己吧，但是当下还是如何给我惨淡的前半生结个尾吧，希望各位大佬能够不吝赐教，小弟在此磕头谢过。",

          "description": "今天下午，一朋友在某群 at 我，神秘兮兮的说道要考我一个问题。题目是这样的：\n在 Java 中有 Father 和 Son 类，其中 Son 继承了 Father 类，两类均有 method 方法，现在 Main 类的 main 方法有如下调用：\nFather f = new Son();\nf.method();\n\n问题是，编译此代码，完成后删除 Son.class，请问代码会报错吗？\n我嗤之以鼻，这还用问吗？我甚至可以告诉你这个代码会报的错一定是 NoClassDefFoundError，这也太简单了你拿这个来考我 balabala...\n然而朋友鬼魅一笑（？），你别急啊，题还没出完呢：\n在上述代码的基础上，加入一个 flag justFalse，并环绕到上述代码中：\n// in Main.java\nstatic boolean justFalse = false;\n\n// in Main#main method\nif (justFalse) {\n\tFather f = new Son();\n\tf.method();\n}\n\n同样编译后删除 Son.class，请问代码还还会报错吗？\n我大笑（？）道，这还用问？justFalse 永远是 false，也就是说内部代码永远不可能执行到，那么 Son 类也就永远不可能进入初始化阶段，所以这个代码肯定就不会报错了，这也太简单了你拿这个来考我 balabala...\n然后朋友发来的一张图让我沉默了：\n\n竟然真的会报错，难道 JVM 虚拟机会提前解析并未执行的代码行中包含的类引用吗？不对啊，这和我以前的实践完全不一样，怎么会这样...... 就在我陷入自我怀疑的时候，下一题来了：\n在上述代码的基础上，如果把 Father f = new Son(); 修改为 Son f = new Son();，在同样的操作下，请问代码还还会报错吗？\n我小心翼翼地问道：不会这样它就不会报错了吧...\n朋友淡淡说道：正是。\n我的脑海中此时一万匹草泥马奔驰而过，各种名词在我的大脑中穿过：类加载、静态分派、运行时多态、分支预测... 但没有一个能解释这个诡异的现象。\n我的天塌了。 \n深入了解 JVM 类加载机制\n当说到 JVM 的类加载机制，很多人可能会脱口而出：加载、验证、准备、解析、初始化。如果你接着问他，他可能还会告诉你，解析这个阶段在某些情况下可以在初始化阶段之后开始，这被 JVM 虚拟机称为“惰性解析（\"lazy\" or \"late\" resolution ）”。那么，出现上述情况的原因可能是因为惰性解析被提前了吗？\n然而答案是否定的，在任何情况下，对于一个类，无论其静态分派的类型是什么，其解析都会延迟进行。（即使在 JVM specs 中这种行为是未定义的，虚拟机实现可以选择立刻解析或是延迟解析）\n那么问题出在哪里了呢？经过一番查证，我发现这个报错其实是在 JVM 类加载的验证阶段产生的。\n注意，这里说的不是验证 Son.class 或是 Father.class，而是 Main.class。如果你仔细观察上面给出的堆栈轨迹（在 Oracle JDK 1.8, Hotspot VM 下），其中有一段就是 sun.launcher.LauncherHelper.checkAndLoadMain(LauncherHelper.java:632)。\n在类加载阶段，JVM 虚拟机会试图校验一个类的某些部分是否是未被破坏以及符合预期的。在对 Main.class 类的加载过程中，对于 Father f = new Son(); 和 f.method();，产生了一个包含向上类型转换的多态函数调用，对于这种调用，JVM 虚拟机会试图进行校验，这就需要加载 Son.class 的类结构，而 Son.class 已经被我们删除了，所以产生了报错。\n这种检查需要同时包含 typecast 以及多态函数调用，在上述代码中，无论将变量类型修改为变量的实际类型 Son，亦或者删去对 method 方法的调用，那么也不会产生报错。\n最后，如何验证上述推断是正确的呢？很简单，使用 -noverify 参数关闭 JVM 的类加载校验，你就可以发现上述代码正常运行了。\n（上述代码在 Java 1.8 和 Java 21 的 Hotspot 虚拟机上均能复现。为方便行文，对部分内容有所改编。）",

          "description": "事情起因是这样的。前天的一个帖子里（ https://www.v2ex.com/t/1070885?p=1#reply35 ）大家都表示 AI 对自己的工作无用。我只是有点好奇，为什么我的感觉完全相反？所以想分享一下我的感觉和情况，很好奇大家感觉的没用是什么意义上的没有用（因为不了解专业程序员的工作流程）。\n本人没学过大多数码，但是算法懂。因为工作和研究兴趣需要（ NLP ，很多很冷门的语言），也会经常坐一些很没办法要做的东西。比如分词器，就和 Andrej Karpathy 的网课跟着做，所以其实前一段时间看见他推荐 cursor ，我前天开始也就试着用。然后就觉得 AI 太有用了。我暂时感觉突然摆脱了对程序员的大多数依赖。\n比如，试验阶段就很快用 prompts 做了一个全栈的、机构内部使用的工作记录论坛，感觉很兴奋。因为我之前既不会 java 、也没学过 sql 。就看着看着，debug 的时候，感觉就大概了解了构架、前端后端怎么互动的 blabla ，觉得很不错。我打算马上用现有的经验，写一个网页版的数据库，可以搜集结构化的语料 metadata （就是研究生会看古代语言的、就用这个网页进行标记并且生成结构化的元数据的 database 了，以后 training 时候用）（这样他们做习题就是 labelling slaves 了哈哈）。在之前这是想都不敢想的，肯定会想外包。但即便让专业 coder 做，也会有太多太多需要交流的小细节，比如很多语言是从右到左、从上到下，元音啊各种细节包不包括，乱七八糟的细节，这些调整交流起来会吐血（尤其是 coder 如果完全是技术部门来的），和 cursor 交流就感觉非常好，真的可以一个人把这个想了很久的事情做成。\n再举一个例子，我之前也想过用 OpenAI 的 api 去导出一些专业的语料元数据，但是有一定的格式需求。我大概知道 function calling 和新的 Response format 可以实现，但是因为自己不是专业的，手笨不会做。但程序员一般都只会英语或者欧洲语言，对这些元语料的结构理解需要很多解释（因为现代语言一般语法都很简单），这是去年就一直搁置到现在。昨天突然想起来，半个小时之内就开始用 function calling 自动帮我生成 training data 了。今天打算晚点试试 response format 效果会不会更好。\n所以我会感觉 ai 真厉害，尤其是很多事情可以一个人做了，会比团队快很多。可能有人觉得 AI 不会 debug ，其实不是这样的。第一，这几天 cursor+claudedev 几乎可以解决过程中 60%的错误。即便不能解决，很快要求它们解释哪部分代码是负责的，看懂之后很容易也能修好剩下的问题。（可能对程序员来说，没学过 java 看 java 的代码是荒谬的。但是实际情况是，其实 java 和 python 里也充满了自然语言，大多数问题理解了出在哪里就很容易看见并且修改。一些更高级的概念，比如类的继承啥的，单独看半个小时也基本理解了，虽然具体语句记不住但是可以问 ai 写。更复杂的 transformer 啥的框架确实要另外学懂才会改造，这个 ai 不行。还有， 剩下 40%的几率 ai 即便不能完全 debug 、但可以快速定位是哪些代码，定位速度可能比有经验的眼睛还快）\n是不是专业程序员写的程序都比这些任务要复杂很多，所以 ai 会失效？还是什么别的原因会觉得 ai 鸡肋呢？真心好奇，避争论。",

          "description": "房子卖掉了，亏了小几万，可以接受，就当买个教训。\n以后都不敢把希望寄托在邻居的素质上了。当然还有新房的质量上了。\n把从买到卖，盘点一下，才发现一路走来，真的一步一坑。\n一 买房\n当时还是限购， 需要摇号。\n我家就一个人有资格，\n摇中后， 两个选择：\n1 付定金 2w 。  2 放弃购买，半年内无资格参与摇号\n当时只有样板间，也没什么好参考的，\n所以除非有特别原因 等同于只能选 1 。\n然后约付首付，又是两个选择\n1 付首付。2 放弃 损失定金。\n所以等同于还是只有一个选择。\n我印象里付完首付，才签的合同，记不太清了。\n当时宣传的是房子当年年底就可以交房，我们也是被这个吸引的。\n实际签合同时，在未有任何通知的情况下，合同上的交房时间比宣传的延期了 7 个月。\n这时候同样两个选择，1 签合同，2 扯皮，大概率亏钱。\n毕竟定金，首付都交了，贼船已经上了。\n所以实际上，等同于还是只有一个选择。\n然后交房时间比合同上的还要延期，实际晚了一年半。\n哦 对了 当时还新实行了一个政策，大意就是不卖毛坯了，卖精装修，合同上装修价格是每平米两千多。\n也是没法反对的。\n还能咋样呢，继续签字呗。\n二 收房\n当时花了两百多，请了个验房师。\n人家倒也算敬业，大大小小便利贴，贴了一屋子。\n什么空鼓，裂缝，锁装反了，比比皆是。\n最搞笑的是，燃气热水器孤零零的挂在那，居然接不到燃气管。\n然后呢 报备到开发商，\n偶尔才有下文。\n有些改了，大部分不了了之。\n同样，业主一点办法都没有。\n看似有选择，实则无选择。\n不收房，房子也是你的，问题也还是存在的，我有邻居三年没收房，里面的门还是没装的。\n只能先住着吧。\n三 住房\n三个字，质量差。\n今天这里坏，明天那里坏。\n电梯不到一年，就频繁的关人，或者维修。\n洗脸池，睡前还好好的，起床发现洗脸池掉地上了。\n有个业主很委屈的在群里说，“你们啥时候来给我修灯啊，我都摸黑半年了”。\n最大的槽点是隔音，极其的差。\n楼上，楼上的楼上，楼下的走路说话唱歌，我都可以听到。\n我的房子里就像恐怖片一样，明明就我一个人，能听到一大家子的声音，\n身临其境。\n有走路的，有放东西的，有大喊的，有跑步的，有关门的，\n此起彼伏，热闹非凡。\n偏偏我楼上素质极差，十岁大的小孩，三年学不会穿拖鞋，大人放任不管。大人七点吵架，摔东西。\n沟通过，讲道理过，吵架过，反击过，甚至想过同归于尽，\n不胜其烦。\n当时还是限售，想卖都卖不掉，我是生生的被折磨了几年。\n最后限售过了，很多原因叠加，决定卖了。\n四 卖房\n现在卖房的情况是，不管你装修，不管你户型，不管你楼层，不管你的任何附加价值，只看小区的近期成交价。\n这肯定是不合理的，\n因为就算你去买猪肉，还得分前腿和五花，不同部位的价格肯定不同。\n所以个人感觉这种情况不会持续太久。\n中介，很不专业，房屋信息都能讲错，只会不停的劝你降价。\n（我的房子挂的价格是很公道的，贝壳评分也很高，并没有挂高价）\n甚至出现过疑似虚假带看的行为。\n有一个很假的客户，他走后我就知道，第二天中介肯定要来报价，果然报价了。\n签约，合同是统一的模板，但感觉对卖方的保障不够到位，\n比如如果因为买家问题，导致贷款批不下来，最后终止合同，默认选项是定金返还。\n这就不合理，要不然要定金干嘛呢。\n如果有卖房的朋友，可以关注下这里。\n卖房流程还有一个坑点，首先每个地方的流程和政策是不一样的，可能我说的，其他地方是不存在的。\n买家拿到新房产证后，需要去抵押，然后银行放款。\n这里的坑点就是，如果买家不去抵押，选择了取消贷款，房子已经过户了，你尾款收不到。\n我不知道其他的地方是怎么保障这一块的。\n我去问过银行，他们说，买家是可以取消贷款的，银行不能阻止，也不会通知卖家。\n我也网上查过，有地方是发生过这种 zha 骗的。\n如果买家确实要买，那就没问题，如果别有用心，就很难说。\n所以我当时还是焦虑了两天，还好收到钱了。\n综上，这就是我从买到卖的经历。\n如果踩几个坑，那也许是我运气不好。\n如果每一步都踩了坑，我想不会全是因为我衰。\n反正经历了这一切，我是不太想买房子了，至少不买新房。\n唉 其实房子卖了，还是有点舍不得的，折磨了我这么久，但我也投入了这么多精力和感情。\n现在无车无房无债，有存款。\n希望开始新的生活。",

          "description": "2024 ，0826-0901\n暑假结束了，天气凉快了，孩子终于要开学了。\n8 月数据总结\n最近一个多月都在全身心在新 App 上，所有的在架 App 都没有任何打理。\n总得来看，下载量提升很多，App Store 和 Google Play 的收入没什么变化，但是国内安卓市场的收入大幅减少。\n下载量（极简时钟）\nApp Store ，增长 44%\nGoogle Play ，增长 19.30%\n国内安卓市场，因为上个月的数据不全，就和 6 月份对比，增长了 18.7%\n收入变化\nApp Store ，增长 2.2%\nGoogle Play ，增长 9.08%\nAdmob ，增长 0.28%\n国内安卓市场，减少 18.92%\nShip-A-Ton 第三周\nShip-A-Ton 就剩 18 天了，感觉要砍掉一个大功能才能勉强提交了。\n这周严重阻碍开发进度的就是黑神话·悟空！。每天都会玩到后半夜一点多，这就导致睡眠不足，严重影响到了白天的开发效率。\n这周的番茄钟数量是 26 ，相比上周多了 4 个， 但也只是 4 个而已。开发速度太慢了，这让我又开始焦虑了。\n\n这周有两个主要的进展，一是完成了第三个功能模块的原型，跑通了整个流程。这个模块经历了两次更名，一开始叫 Wishlist ，再后来叫 Goals ，最后定为 Desires 。\n另一个进展就是和设计师顺利达成了合作，App 的 UI 终于有保证了。这一周的绝大部分开发时间都花在了 UI 上，和我之前自己瞎写的 UI 一对比，简直是云泥之别。专业的事情还是要交给专业的人来做。\n[Vlog: Week 3 for Shipaton]\n本周探索\n监测 ScrollView 滚动状态\n需要在新 App 里加入对 ScrollView 滚动状态的监测，看完了肘子哥的文章，# 如何判断 ScrollView 、List 是否正在滚动中。因为 App 是 iOS 17+ 的，还不能直接使用 iOS 18 的新 API ， 直接就使用了肘子哥的 IsScrolling 。\n单复数的文案本地化\nApp 里需要用的针对单词单复数的不同文案，所以就第一次使用了 SwiftUI 中 Text 对单复数的 API ，不用自己写 if else 判断，很优雅。# Pluralisation made simpler in SwiftUI\nSVG 转成 SF Symbols\n我想要把 MasterGo/Figma 里面的切图导出后，放到 Xcode 中，然后通过 Image 和 foregroundStyle 给切图加上不同的颜色，就像 SF Symbols 那样。导出成 jpg 和 png 都无法做到，尝试导出 SVG 后才发现 SwiftUI 的 Image 还不支持 SVG 。\n我就想着怎么能把 SVG 转成 SF Symbols ，找了两个工具 App ，都是收费的，连试用也没有，我就没敢直接付费。于是我就问了下 ChatGPT 怎么将 SVG 转换成 SF Symbols ，AI 的回答如下：\n\n我就在这个回答里找到了解决方案：PDF ！将 icon 导出为 PDF ，放到 Xcode 的 Asset 里，然后将图片设置为 Render as Template Image 就可以了。\n生活\n吃了两顿大餐，还发现了一家不错的面馆。\n和许久没见的老同学见面，畅聊一晚。\n\n直面天命，刚过第五回，下周肯定能通关了。\n第三回，黄眉差一点初见过，我以为还有一个阶段变身，当时葫芦也没酒了，就摆烂打了。\n第四回，晦月魔君确实恶心，我是天命人，不是修脚师傅！\n第五回，死的最多次数居然是在铁球山路……\n\n最近因为玩游戏和写代码，尤克里里都生疏了，每天练习时间大大减少，甚至有一两天都没拿起来。花了将近一个月练习 Em 和弦终于成功了，录了 New Boy 。\n[Vlog: Ukulele - New Boy]\n视频内容还请移步到公众号文章里查看： https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/OgBlZGfDmPtq7hFY7XLi9g",

          "description": "文科转码，毕业五年，从最开始的 Java 业务开发，转到 Go 后端开发，再到分布式存储，再转到数据库内核。\n折腾了两个开源项目，分别有 4.5k star 和 2k star 。\n公众号 8k 粉丝，B 站 7k 粉丝，知乎 5k 粉丝。\n有几点感受最为深刻：\n拥抱变化，其实这也是我觉得毕业这五年以来最大的一个感受，变化是每时每刻都存在的，我们的一些工作内容有可能随着我们自己的兴趣发生变化，也有可能随着其他的一些环境的因素发生变化。比如说你跳槽了，业务方向不一样了，或者是转了语言，其实都有可能，或者是你自己的一些组织架构发生了一些调整，导致你的工作内容也发生了很多变化，都是很正常的。所以说对于很多刚毕业没多久，或者说还没有毕业的同学，一定要有一种拥抱变化的一种心态。我们的工作内容可能随时跟随着很多因素去变化，所以说这个时候，不要把自己局限在一个小的范围之内。\n追求极致，去做别人坚持不下去的事情，才能和别人拉开差距。\n热爱某件事情就去折腾，或许这件事儿能够带给你意想不到的惊喜\n有时候也觉得迷茫，对于我们程序员群体来说，可能并没有什么丰富的业余活动，社交的圈子也比较窄，如果又是一个比较内向的人的话，可能有的时候在这样一个大城市当中，会觉得非常的孤独，就是没有什么知心的朋友。亲朋好友可能也隔得比较远，没有什么太多的联系。\n我觉得这可能是每一个打工人可能都会有的一种孤独感吧。\n原文发布于博客： https://roseduan.github.io",

          "description": "一则关于程序员的的笑话\n老婆：你去买 2 斤西红柿，路上看到卖西瓜的就买 2 个。\n“半个小时后，程序员拿着 2 个西红柿给到了媳妇。”\n老婆：你怎么就买了 2 个西红柿？\n程序员：路上看到卖西瓜的了\n京 B 牌照摩托车能不能进入到四环路内辅路行驶？\n背景（给不是北京的小伙伴的）\n根据道路交通安全法律法规的规定，对本市部分道路上行驶的摩托车采取交通管理措施如下：四环路（不含辅路）以内道路全天禁止京 B 号牌摩托车行驶。\n以上出自： https://jtgl.beijing.gov.cn/hudong/xinxiang/jtgl/sindex/bjah-index-dept!detail.action?originalId=AH23091310036\n关键的一句话就是：四环路（不含辅路）以内道路全天禁止京 B 号牌摩托车行驶。\n问题\n北京的四环路是封闭的一个环状，这就有了“四环里”和“四环外”的说法，四环主路两次存在“内辅路”和“外辅路”的说法。\n我媳妇认为可以进入四环内，只要在内辅路行驶就没问题\n其解题思路为：\n京 B 牌照摩托车\n// 1: 不能在四环主路上行驶\n// 2: 不能在四环内行驶\n// 3: 可以在四环辅路行驶，内辅路也是辅路\n\n所以，可以从四环路的某个桥底下，进入四环内，然后拐入到四环内辅路即可。所有的条件都符合啊\n\n\n为此我媳妇打过电话给交警 12123 。\n第 1 个客服说：不行。\n第 2 个客服说：不知道，没有明确规定。\n然后网上也有支持她这个观点的帖子： https://www.yiche.com/baike/131762.htm\n我说进入就违法扣分\n我就给她讲了开头那个买西瓜的笑话。\n但是没说服她～～\n为啥我们会讨论这个事呢？因为我俩都有京 B 牌照摩托车～",

          "description": "立秋了，但还是很热。\n镇上创文明树新风，\n取缔无证小商小贩，\n整治商户门前用地。\n像阿志这种站街揽客卖服务的，\n都被无限期勒令停业。\n阿志没了事做。\n***\n午后，\n在阿宝超市门口，\n树下的长椅上，\n阿志躺了。\n太阳很大，\n但树荫下并不太热。\n微风偶而吹过，\n温温的，很舒服。\n迷迷糊糊中，\n阿志似乎听到了咔嚓声，\n母亲切开冰镇大西瓜，\n自己在小桌前，\n期待着。\n***\n“别翻了！冰糕全都让你给翻坏了！”\n是阿宝的声音。\n阿宝老婆一般不让他来看店，\n因为他老得罪人。\n有一次，\n一个老太太讨价还价，来回了几句，\n阿宝一把夺过老太太手里的东西，\n把人给轰了出去。\n现在阿宝关上了冰柜拉门，\n要赶走面前的大爷。\n大爷稀疏的头发和着汗水粘在头皮上，\n抬头看着阿宝，张开的嘴微颤着，\n说不出话来。\n这时，阿宝老婆回来了。\n“来了何大爷！\n棒棒冰换位置了，\n在里面这个冰柜呢。”\n说着拿出一个棒棒冰递给何大爷，\n何大爷接过，放下几个硬币，\n转身朝树下走来。\n***\n阿志看何大爷来了，\n连忙坐起让出位置。\n“日子没法过了啊！”\n何大爷坐下，叹了一口气，\n把棒棒冰一掰两节，\n递给阿志一半：\n“太凉了，我一个人吃不完。”\n阿志没说话，接了过来。\n“日子真是没法过了啊！”\n何大爷又说了一遍。\n“是啊～”\n阿志应了一句。\n何大爷就接受了邀请，开始了倾诉。\n***\n年初，何大爷死了老婆。\n“活着的时候，总吵架，\n这死了，连吵架的人都没有了。”\n“跟你吵架，都是因为在乎你，\n不在乎的，都不会搭理你。”\n“女儿没用，早晚都要嫁出去，\n不嫁出去也没时间应付我这老头子。”\n“人老了，就招人嫌。”\n“她要是嫁出去，我也就不再操心了。”\n“都三十好几了，还能嫁出去吗？”\n何老头停下来，看着阿志。\n阿志低头，\n嗦着棒棒冰，思考着，\n不知道这是个疑问句还是反问句。\n何老头没等到阿志回答，\n继续唠叨了下去。\n棒棒冰吃完了，\n何老头在裤子上抹了抹手，说：\n“要不……你给我推个头吧？”\n***\n吃人嘴软，阿志就答应了。\n外边不让摆摊，\n何老头就说去他家推，\n推完刚好方便洗一下。\n推完，\n何老头去洗，\n阿志说要走。\n何老头从洗手间里顶着湿头发跑出来，\n抓住阿志的手说：\n“不走不走！吃个瓜再走！吃个瓜再走！”\n阿志说不了不了，何老头急得跺脚：\n“瓜太大！我一个人吃不完！切开了就要坏！”\n阿志就留下了。\n吃完瓜，\n何老头又要了阿志手机号，\n说自己的手机两星期没响了，\n以前还有推销电话，现在连推销的也没了。\n“那你女儿呢？”\n阿志说完，就觉得自己多了嘴。\n何老头长叹一口气：\n“不知道。”\n“那你没问问？”\n可能是觉得吃了别人的瓜，\n多少要说两句，阿志就又多了一嘴。\n“一年回来一次，死了给你下葬，\n就不错了，别想太多。”\n“问一问嘛，万一有什么事呢？”\n***\n最后还是问了。\n何老头拔了电话，开着免提，\n嘟到第五声，终于接通了。\n“爸？！怎么给我打电话了？！有事么？！”\n“啊……”\n“你现在在家么？！出什么事情了么？！”\n“在家，没事……”\n“那挂了啊～我正搬着东西呢！”\n嘟一下，电话就挂了。\n阿志不知道该说什么，\n屋里一片沉默。\n何老头把手机咣当扔到一边：\n“看，还没死就不能给女儿打电话！”\n这时，咚咚咚门响了。\n“开门！”\n是一个女人的声音。\n何老头噌一下从椅子上站起来，看着门口。\n“爸！快开门！东西拿不住了！”\n阿志冲过去，打开了门。\n***\n门外，是何老头的女儿。\n“你这个时候回来干什么？！”\n何老头又气又喜又不愿人看出来，\n一边说着气话一边从女儿手里接过东西，\n“西瓜都吃完了，早说就给你留一些！”\n“不用！我带了！”\n说着，何老头女儿转身抱进来一个大西瓜。\n阿志要走，\n父女俩实在热情，\n把阿志按在了椅子上，\n一定要留他吃晚饭。\n饭后，喝茶闲聊。\n何老头问阿志，\n三十多岁单身又没病，\n怎么就没想着找个老婆？\n阿志放下茶碗，犹豫了一下，\n讲起了自己从来没讲过的事。\n***\n三年前，有突变病毒时，\n阿志和女朋友准备领证，\n女朋友回父母家拿户口本。\n女朋友刚下车，\n病毒爆发，全城静默。\n被判为密接，立即隔离，\n凌晨被装上了转运大巴。\n然后就出了车祸。\n再也没能回来。\n阿志发了疯，打了人，\n被关进去了几个月。\n出来后，\n没了工作，也没了爱人，\n想着不如回家照顾父母，\n就回来了。\n刚到家，管控放开，\n所有人都得上了那个病。\n刚开始那两天，\n买不到药，只能硬扛。\n扛过去的人里，\n没有阿志的父母。\n***\n“日子过着没意思，\n没想过会干起快推。”\n阿志笑了笑，端起了茶碗。\n又坐了一会儿，阿志告辞，\n何老头女儿出门送客。\n“谢谢你来给我爸理发。”\n阿志想说：“不用谢，收了钱的”，\n忽然想起，收钱的事，又忘记了。\n***\n太阳落山了，\n天空是很深很深的蓝色，\n隐约有几颗星星在闪。\n一阵温热的夜风吹来，\n夹着一丝凉爽。\n这灼人的夏天，\n似乎真的要结束了。",

          "description": "首先宇宙安全声明没用的 GPT 回答确实很垃圾，奈何它这次说的有点过于正确。。。\n心理压力增加: 高压式教育通常会导致孩子感受到巨大的心理压力。长期处于这种状态可能导致焦虑、抑郁等心理健康问题。\n自尊心和自信心受损: 当孩子在高压下无法达到预期目标时，他们可能会感到自卑、怀疑自己的能力，从而损害自尊心和自信心。\n亲子关系紧张: 高压式的教育方式可能会导致父母与孩子之间的关系变得紧张。孩子可能会觉得不被理解，甚至反感父母的教育方式，疏远与父母的关系。\n学习兴趣减退: 把学习任务变成高压的责任，可能会让孩子对学习失去兴趣，把学习当成痛苦的负担，而不是乐趣和探索的来源。\n身体健康问题: 长期的高压可能会对孩子的身体健康产生不良影响，如失眠、食欲不振、免疫力下降等。\n竞争观念扭曲: 孩子可能会错误地认为成功只能通过激烈竞争和不懈努力获得，忽略了合作、创造力和个人爱好的重要性。\n社交技能缺失: 在高压环境下，孩子可能会花大量时间在学习上，忽略了社交活动，导致社交技巧欠缺，不懂得如何与人交往和合作。\n价值观扭曲: 过于强调成绩、名次等外在评价标准，可能会让孩子形成错误的价值观，忽视内在品质和多样化的成功标准。\n反抗行为: 持续的压力可能会引发孩子的逆反心理，出现不服从、对抗等行为，甚至会出现逃避、厌学等情况。",

          "description": "这已经是第三次参加亚宠展了，它的全称是亚洲宠物展，展会涉及到各大厂商的粮食，零食，玩具，衣服，家具，洗护用品等等，一切你想到的和想不到的关于宠物的东西在这里都能找到 。\n记得几年前买家里的那只蓝猫时，原来猫主人就说等到了每年的亚宠展，就会带我们去薅羊毛，可以领到的东西非常的多，带个行李箱过去都会塞的满满当当的。\n现场很火爆\n去年参加了一次，今天参加了一次它博会，再加上这一次，全程下来，感觉很累很累，几千家的店铺分别在 W 系列馆，E 系列馆，N 系列馆，这所有的馆都走一遍，腿就已经酸的不行了，何况是每个馆都分布了几百家商铺，来来回回的兜圈。\n像那种大型的宠物商家，如渴望，巅峰这种，是热门中的大热门，需要很早很早就来会场抢，我们 9 点多过去就已经晚了，而这几次的疯狂小狗，弗列加特，蓝氏等等，由于商家送的东西很多，所以就吸引了很多人过来排队打卡。有时候活动还没有开始，门口就排了很长很长的队伍，看着现场很拥挤，很吓人，但是活动是很有秩序的，派发的也很多快，所以队伍流通的也很快。\n活动参与方式\n大部分商家的活动形式就是关注，关注小红书账号，关注抖音账号，关注淘宝账号就可以，有一些商家会让发一些小红书的笔记，笔记中带有商家的话题或者是亚宠展的话题，还有一些是我比较喜欢的形式，就是做游戏，商家会在现场准备游戏场地，比如套圈，丢沙包，像今年有一些新的游戏形式如愤怒的小鸟弹弓，砸铁锤等等。本来大家都比较疲惫，有时候排队时间比较长，通过这种游戏与运气的方式，能够有效的环节疲劳，增加趣味性。\n能薅到哪些羊毛\n取决于商家的类型，像卖食品的一边都会送一些猫粮，狗粮的试用装，或者是猫条，冻干，湿粮等等，而像一些洗护用品会送一些除臭剂，洗护剂，一些药品公司会送一些驱虫的试用装。一些装饰公司送了一些猫猫狗狗用的喝水的折叠碗或者是类似于子弹头的便携袋子。现场最不缺的就是各种袋子了，就是印有自己商标的各种大的购物袋。\n哪些人能参加\n这个展每年都会举办一次，一般都是举办 4,5 天，前 3 天都是面向商家或者是专业观众的，后两天是面对消费者的。所谓的专业观众就是有猫猫狗狗的宠物店店主等，我理解的前面三天都是商家谈合作的，对于我们这种普通的猫猫狗狗的家长来说，一般就选在周六周天去。\n除了薅羊毛还能干啥\n有些人可能说，对于那些试用装我没有兴趣，我有钱，想买就直接买了，为什么要浪费时间去薅羊毛？其实，去参加这个展会，也是开阔自己眼界的一个方式，像去年认识了疯狂小狗这个品牌，从此就一直关注了它，发现它一直在举办各种宠物的活动，有时候有空了就会带宠物参加。\n其次，现场也会有这种优质的宠物宝宝们，不仅有猫猫，狗狗，也会有各种比较小众的宠物，如安哥拉兔子，仓鼠，乌龟，蜥蜴，蛇等，看似小众，这些展位往往人山人海，大家都有猎奇的心理。比如说养蛇，你平时会比较会很少见到，但是在这个展会上你会见到来自全国各地来的宠物爱好者。\n不过今年参加下来，明显感觉冷淡了很多，不仅能耗到的羊毛少了，而且周六去的，发现有些小场地商家已经开始撤场了，有的在做清仓大甩卖，也不难理解，商家们大老远的运这些产品来上海，也不想再付一笔运费又把它们运回去。",

          "description": "步入职场 3 年，第一次碰到这种情况，简而言之，老板也想蹭蹭 LLM 的热度，想要研发部搞个方案，小弟不巧玩了很长一段时间，并在一年前做了一个类似 dify 的开源项目，其实也不算类似，因为我和 dify 的上线时间只差 1 一个月，可以说是同步进行的同类产品，不赘述，与本事件相关性不大\n说回主题，我上司可以说是完全“借鉴”了我的项目（他也知道我有这个项目，并看过），从核心技术栈，到向量数据库选型，到流程引擎驱动设计，甚至知识库生成方案都没有一点改动\n更气的是，老板还真想落地试试做个 Demo ，我上司居然又想把活甩给我，用了我的方案，最后还要直接把我项目魔改一下完成他的 KPI ，我应不应该直接拒绝？毕竟我司独特的组织架构，他并不是我的唯一上司，也不一定能给我穿到小鞋，但是这么不给他面子，以后在公司抬头不见低头见也很尴尬",

          "description": "背景\n女朋友是今年的应届生，普通本科 视觉传达设计专业，父母在北京这边做点小生意，我也在北京，所以她实习就在北京，工作也在这儿找。\n水平在我看来是挺不错的，不管是平时那些设计作业，还是最后的毕业设计，我看了都觉得眼前一亮，在她们专业成绩也一直是第一名。\n知道这个学历和专业实在算不上好，所以预期并不高，大厂只是投一下简历凑个热闹，主要还是在找小公司 10k 以下的设计类工作，没想到这种要求了，还这么难。\n主要经过\n3-5 月\n在一家在线教育公司的平面设计岗实习，公司比较大，也比较规范，虽然钱不多，她干得挺开心，领导们评价也不错。5 月底回校准备毕业展的时候，跟领导确认无法转正，没有坑位，很洒脱地就辞了，想着毕业之后再找。结果，这一找，就找到了现在。\n6 月至今\n6 月份的时候我没怎么问，她自己也想先玩几天，有一搭没一搭地投简历，自然是没什么结果。进入 7 月份，她就有点急了，本来投的还都是上家公司那种规模的（ 1000+），无果后开始投各种小公司，结果还是没回音。\n我们俩商量，不行了，得换策略。\n不局限于文化行业了，各种行业的，但凡是个设计岗，都投。\n大部分岗位动辄要求两三年工作经验，所以现在就不在乎薪资了，只要能入职，工资低无所谓，积攒点工作经验以后再跳。\n有效果，陆续开始收到面试了，大多都是 10-50 个人的公司，给的薪资也都是 5-6K 。陆陆续续参加了十几次面试，结果，竟然一个都没能找到。我给大家挑几个典型的说一下：\n几个典型\n新型书店：早 10 晚 7 、偶尔出差、双休、五险一金、7K\n这是最想去的一个，公司实际上是个 书店+咖啡店+会场服务 的模式。排除掉服务员厨师什么的，算上老板一共就不到十个人。\n第一轮面试的时候，跟面试官聊得很好，面试官都让准备好入职手续了，说问下老板意见，应该没有大问题，结果老板要求加一轮面试。\n老板的那场面试，女朋友说全程没捞着说话，老板从工作内容讲到国家经济发展形势，又讲到人生哲理和对年轻人的殷切嘱托，然后就结束了，可以走了。\n第一轮的面试官说，老板有些其他顾虑，但是她本人非常认可，所以她会帮忙再争取下。然后，就没信了。\n打印店：早 8 晚 8 、单休、五险、7K\n说是某某文化公司，实际上是个大一点的打印店，所以会接一点帮小公司做点宣传册的设计工作。在招聘软件上确认了上述条件后，去现场面试了。\n出来面试的是打印店老板，对上述谈好的条件都不清楚，从头开始谈。PUA 一番后说工资 6K ，女友表示接受之后他突然说，刚才看错了，以为是有两年经验，没想到是个刚毕业的，那 6K 就不行了，只能给 4K 。再次表示接受之后，又说，工作时间不固定，只要店里有顾客就不能下班，五险一金统统没有，说团队培养新人也要成本云云。\n能看出来，人家就是不想要，所以也没有再纠缠。\n传媒公司&电玩城：早 11 晚 10 、月休 4 天、五险、5K\n老板有个电玩城，还有个传媒公司。所以去了之后既要给电玩城设计优惠券宣传图，还要给传媒公司设计些海报。从这个工作时间也能看出来还得兼电玩城服务人员。\n去面试，一开始，老板和副总就架个手机在那儿拍我对象。自我介绍完了之后，一边调整手机一边让重新说一遍，拍完之后两个人就走了，剩个戴眼镜的男的面试。问了包含星座血型 MBTI 等各种信息，让我对象详细介绍了自己的家庭情况和人生经历，然后开始点评。对象一边哭一边跟我复述他那些油腻到让人不适的发言，我都能想象这个老男人是用什么样的眼神打量眼前的年轻女孩。\n我的感受\n不找了，找个屁，这些狗屎工作工资还没我的零头高。我知道这是社会中的大多数，我也不是想抱怨，我只是觉得，我实在没必要让我对象吃这样的苦。她在家爱干啥干啥，网上接单作图一个月也能赚两三千了。\n但是她接受不了。\n好歹也是个本科生，她想不通为什么找个本专业的工作这么难，也接受不了自己只能做这样的工作。我想劝劝她，可最后也只能长叹一声，咋办呢？各位老哥？",

          "description": "先介绍下背景，坐标欧洲，家宽是墙上 RJ45 网口直接 DHCP 获取公网静态 IPv4 ，无 IPv6 ，这个 IPv4 似乎是跟着 MAC 地址的，只要 MAC 地址不变，这个公网 IPv4 就不变。平时插着一个小米路由器来用。\n然后我有台旧的 ThinkPad ，运行 Win10 ，Windows Update 一直开着的，平时一直都会更新到最新版。很多年了一直 24 小时运行，当个服务器用，平时跑些东西，没跑 HTTP ，也有在路由器上映射一些端口方便公网直接访问，主要是 3389 和 SSH （ Windows 自带的 OpenSSH ），当然在公网上的端口不是 3389 和 22 ，不过现在这似乎并不重要，人家都是直接扫服务的。还有一些其它端口是做 Tailscale 的跳板，也就是把我的 Tailscale 其它一些设备的一些端口通过这台 ThinkPad 跳到公网上，方便在外面不需要通过 Tailscale 来直接访问我的 Tailscale 网络中的一些设备。直接用的是 Windows 的 portproxy 。\n很多年了一直很稳定，这 ThinkPad 从来没死过机，没出过问题，平时基本就在旁边吃灰。\n然后今年 6 月 24 日我回国休假，记得 6 月 25 日我还在国内试着连了下这 ThinkPad 的 3389 ，看看速度啊啥的，也没用来干啥事。然后 26 号以后就连不上了，Tailscale 也显示这台机子离线。当时我也没管，因为想着可能死机了或者网崩了啥的，无所谓了到时回去了再看看怎么回事。\n然后今天刚回到欧洲，诡异的事情来了！！！！！\n第一件事是先发现 WIFI 上不了网，手机能连上小米路由器 WIFI ，但是无网络，登后台页面说 DHCP 无响应。以为路由器出了什么幺蛾子，第一时间重启路由器嘛，还是不行。\n然后看了下 ThinkPad ，发现 ThinkPad 死机了，按大小写灯不亮，屏幕也不亮，先没管，想着先去弄好网络先，看看网络怎么回事\n插拔了几次网线/重启路由都提示 DHCP 无响应，于是试试直接把网线插电脑上，但是网线插我电脑上又能获取到 IP 能正常上网，第一反应是路由器 WAN 口的 MAC 地址被运营商封了？然后路由器 WAN 口改个 MAC 地址，马上能获取 DHCP 能上网了，但是没过几秒又断网了，然后 DHCP 又获取不到地址了，像是被秒封了（划重点！）。\n这时无意间看到 ThinkPad 连着的交换机灯在狂闪（ ThinkPad 通过一个千兆有线交换机连到小米路由 LAN 口，此时交换机上没有除了 ThinkPad 和小米路由之外的设备），这时还是死机状态，连的显示器不亮，按大小写键盘灯不亮，风扇也不转说明 CPU 不热），于是我长按电源键强行关机重启了下 ThinkPad 。一重启网马上就正常了，小米路由 DHCP 马上有响应，马上能上网，甚至路由 MAC 地址都没改，然后改回路由默认的 WAN 口 MAC 地址也能正常上网正常获取 IP 了，一切都恢复正常了。\n妈也，细思极恐，不知道是不是我的 ThinkPad 被黑了有人做肉鸡一直 DDoS 啥的然后导致一插网线就被运营商封？现在我也还原不了现场了，ThinkPad 重启后一切都正常了，不知道当时交换机灯狂闪在那闪什么，早知应该当时直接把路由器 WAN 口插电脑上然后开 Wireshark 抓个包。\n看了下 ThinkPad 的 Windows 日志，系统那一栏没有什么异常，到 6 月 26 号晚上 19 点之后就没有了，像是突然死机的那种。\n然后安全那一栏能看到很多登录失败的，像是 3389/SSH 被爆破\n\n以前也遇到过也没什么，我也没弱密码，单纯爆破应该发生不了这些事情\n对了，这台 ThinkPad 上还装有火绒，基本上只打开了文件监控和下载防护，火绒没杀到什么毒，今天也 Windows Update 了一波，那个恶意软件删除工具也没杀到东西。简单看了下进程啥的都没有异常。\n这一切事件太诡异了，首先之前这么久从来没出过问题，稳定得一逼，偏偏在我回国休假第二天出的问题（难道我被搞了？），然后死机就死机吧，这死机的时候交换机灯还狂闪还搞得上不了网，虽然我不知道是不是真的是 ThinkPad 发出什么有问题的包被运营商封，但是一强行关机重启马上就正常。而且当时确实路由器改 WAN 口 MAC 地址之后得了这么几秒，然后又一模一样的现象了，直到重启 ThinkPad ，真的太诡异了。\n害，有没有哥们支下招，有什么要检查的，最好能查查到底发生了什么",

          "description": "唉，最近事事不顺，再加上因为我自身原因和异国恋女友在分手边缘，真的有点撑不下去了，偏偏她又是我最好的朋友，我甚至找不到另一个合适的人倾诉，于是想来发潜水那么久的第一个贴。\n看了一下存款也完全不是自己能安心的数字，冷静下来还是想要先走好自己的路，自己已经到了 29 的边缘，也看到了其他相似经历的朋友的帖子，实在有点迷茫，所以还是想想听听大家的看法。\n个人情况\n18 年某 985 计算机科班毕业，本校研没保上，次一级外校有资格但是自己好高骛远放弃了去考 THU ，结果复试被刷；本科期间技术积累不足，不太敢面大厂，第一份工作去了一个初创公司做嵌入式，做了一年不太喜欢工作氛围和领导画饼，再加上依旧想深造，就辞职到离家很近的一个车企做车联网相关的 App 开发工作了，想着应该有时间在职备考，结果前两年几乎忙疯，第三年遭遇电信诈骗直接损失了近 20W （别骂了），没敢跟家里说，接近 2/3 的积蓄都没了。去年项目开始缓过来，也有女友远程加持，拼 PKU 软微还是倒在一路神仙分数之下。唉，现在一想自己完全没有赶上互联网红利末班车，还真是一步错，步步错了。\n工作情况\n目前在做的工作主要还是 App 相关开发，技术栈主要包含 Objective-C 、Swift 、Swift UI 、Flutter ，以及一部分 Unity ，在部门相当于干主管活，但实际无人可管。公司目前落地的 App 都是属于品牌车主+车友圈+商场整合型的 App ，相关业务涵盖车联网、社区、以及商品交易，访问量还可以，但感觉技术难点基本不在我们前端/客户端。\n目前公司整体业绩在下降，部门已经经历了两次降薪。\n目前想法\n有离职想法，但比较纠结时间。其实之前工作也还算不错，离家比较近，降薪前收入在当地也还可以，两边父母也都满意，但是这几年真的改变了很多，很多福利都没有了，甚至政府的人才补贴都欠了我两年，现在感情出现问题，也越来越不想待了。可能其他地方也差不多，但是我真的感觉自己被困住了，想逃离这里。可能视精神状况和感情状况再考虑要不要裸辞，如果情况依旧还在变坏，我想我也需要 gap 一段时间再重新出发。目前主要还是不知道最近的下一步应该怎么走。想了一些可能的选择：\n继续深耕 iOS/Flutter 开发（有经验但前景未知）\n扩展后端赛道（有助于求职但经验少竞争多）\n扩展 AI 算法赛道（热门但难度高）\n尝试远程工作（如感情问题解决会很方便两人发展但存在语言和薪金保障问题）",

          "description": "因为现在小米官方已经不支持玩机了，就想买一台最后一代支持解锁的机型 K60 来解锁刷机，延长点折腾的乐趣。但这段时间从京东和其他渠道收了几台机子，都发现被升级到了 HyperOS ，最后都只能退货了事。在京东、拼多多、拍拍、以及转转的线下门店问了很多，都不支持发货前确认系统。\n目前又刚从转转收了一台机子，下单前客服确认是 MIUI 的系统，但拿到手仍然是 HyperOS 。要退货再购买吧，这段时间折腾下来，觉得再也不可能从靠谱的渠道收到仍然是 MIUI 系统的 K60 了。想要自己尝试解锁降级，看了网上的一些分享，似乎之前的方法目前已经没有把握一定会成功了。担心最后不行错过了 7 天的退货期，最终砸在自己手里。所以，现在也很犹豫。\n不知道有没有其他 K60 的用户最近有过解锁降级的经历，想要了解下。\n人各有志，我能够理解很多人习惯了买来的房子原先的装修是什么样都一直那么住下去，也能够理解很多人习惯了安装的输入法默认的单行候选只有 5 个也就那么一直用下去，但我是喜欢根据自己的需要来折腾的人，所以，就用不着劝我“这年头正经人谁解锁刷机”了。",

          "description": "2024 ，0819-0825\n开发进度被严重阻碍，时也命也。\nShip-A-Ton 第二周\n这周投入这个 App 的时间很少，吃喝玩乐+直面天命占了不少时间，但是不管怎样，还是在推进。和上一周相比，这周的工作时间大幅减少，只完成了 22 个番茄钟，还不如上周的一半多。\n\n这周一开始花了一些时间在解决 TabView 和 NavigationStack 之间的问题上，本来是想尝试实现一个自定义的 TabBar ，最终放弃了这个尝试，因为根据上周的教训，不能花太多时间在 UI 上，先专注于功能的实现。\nStash 和 Nibble 的功能基本都完成了，Jar 目前只实现了两种类型，还剩几种存款类型没做。为了能够 ship ，或许应该先砍掉一些 Jar 的类型。\n愿望清单模块又更名了，一开始叫 Wishlist ，后来叫 Goals ，现在改成了 Desires 。\n想想还剩四周了，而还有很多功能，比如通知提醒、数据统计和小组件还都没有做，感觉有点来不及了。\n好消息是，这周接触了一个设计师，已经达成了合作，接下来的四个星期要超级超级肝了！\n第二个英文 Vlog\n这周几乎没有录什么素材，为了撑视频的时长，加入了目前 App 的阶段性演示视频。\n这次我没有自己录音，倒不是怕口音丢人，而是一方面是为了节省时间，另一方面是为了保证音频的音量统一并且没有背景杂音。我用的是剪映的 AI 朗读，先是克隆了我自己的声音，然后把文本通过克隆声音生成对应的朗读音频。这个声音克隆真是厉害，音色没得说，和我一模一样，但是缺点也很明显，就是没有语气的变化，整个停下来感觉非常沉闷。\nWeek 2 for Ship-A-Ton\n本周学习\n# How to use programmatic navigation in SwiftUI\n# Sharing @Observable objects through SwiftUI's environment\n# 在 SwiftData 模型中使用 Codable 和枚举的注意事项\n# ContentUnavailableView: Handling Empty States in SwiftUI\n直面天命\n先说一下进度，目前刚过第三回的苦海。\n周一早上起来，就知道瑞幸开卖周边了，于是立刻下单了外卖，成功抢到周边海报。\n\n目前打得最多的就是白衣秀士、疯虎，被虐了二十多次才过。至于大家都惧怕的虎先锋，我打了四次就过了，比较辛运。目前卡在了寅虎，还在不断精进中。\n这个游戏是我玩得第一个魂 like 游戏。我知道自己手残，之前玩过卧龙·苍天陨落，第一个 BOSS 都没打过去就删了，所以只狼和老头环一直没敢碰。这次黑神话能玩到现在，全靠我玩战神打下的一点基础。这个游戏就是磨练心性，越挫越勇，不断精进，提升自己。\n玩了四天，手柄左摇杆就漂移了，虽然还在保修内，但是客服说需要返场维修，需要 7 到 14 天才能寄回来。本来想着要不就忍忍，这段时间正好用来写代码。但是纠结了一天，一想到要一个多星期不能直面天命，就痛苦不已，最终还是下单了新的手柄，次日达，继续直面天命！",

          "description": "前几天，去朋友工作的小公司溜达，朋友写前端，他身后一哥们写后端，看起来不到三十岁。我闲着无聊，就坐在后端老哥旁边，看他写写代码，不一会儿我朋友前端问题修改完了，打包项目发给他部署到服务器测试一下。这时候我看着后端开始了操作，他们用的是 Caddy Web Server ，于是后端就开始改 Caddyfile 文件：\n:2333 {\n   root * /var/www\n   file_server\n}\n\n:2333 {\n   root * /usr/root/dist\n   file_server\n}\n\n他简单的把之前的复制了一下，改了root路径，就打算重启caddy了。我说：端口也要改吧？他说：先试试。于是重启caddy，发现报端口重复的错误，又再次编辑Caddyfile，把端口改了。那一瞬间我甚至怀疑他是不是第一次写代码了，我虽然没用过caddy，但一个端口配置两个网站，稍微想想也不可能有这种操作吧？\n这件事让我想起几年前隔壁公司的一个女程序员 A ，因为大家一起下楼吃饭，也都比较熟，有一次 A 找我说：JS 有几个地方的代码报错，能不能帮她看看怎么回事？我过去一看，好家伙！一个类里面这样写着：\nclass Store {\n    function getItem(key: string) {\n        // TODO\n    }\n}\n\n我说类里面写函数为什么要加 function 关键字？她说好像有这种语法吧，她试了不行还以为开发环境哪里出错了！\n再说到另一个男同事 B ，这个同事是纯前端，完全不懂一点后端。有一次，他想试试用Node.js怎么读写数据库实现用户登录，然而编辑器却总是提示错误，我偶然瞅了一眼他正在摸索着写的代码，发现他在 JS 文件里这样写着：\nimport sqlite3 from 'sqlite3';\n\nexport function login(req: Request) {\n    sqlite3.SELECT * FROM users\n}\n\n我震惊了！函数里面都不是JS语法，这都看不出来？\n为什么我要说这几个事情呢，因为他们的情况真的太反差了。通过以上几个事情，不管是谁，第一印象都会觉得这几个人水平很菜。但除了第一个后端，后两个我是知道的。女程序员 A 和男同事 B 工作经历大概都是五六年了。\n女程序员 A 在他们公司干了两年，做的项目大概一二十万代码，她每天提交代码，开发能力肯定是够的，后面跳槽去了其他公司，据说干得也很好。\n男同事 B 参与的项目八十多万行代码（ css + js/jsx/ts/tsx + json ）,他参与需求开发和性能优化，平时的工作任务也没出过什么问题。\n你说他们水平不够吧，他们靠自己的能力完全能够应付日常的开发工作。你说他们厉害吧，有时候写出来的代码我甚至都怀疑他们会不会编程。（上面的几个问题，他们不是大意而犯错，是真的不知道自己写错了）\n真是奇哉怪哉！",

GitHub\n该软件的代码已开源并托管在 Public GitHub Repo ，GitHub 账户绑定了我在香港的大学的教育邮箱\n2. 我的主力机\n港版 Nothing Phone (2)，安装的是 GitHub 上 release 版的 APP ，未主动安装过反诈 APP\n3. 我的备用机\n国行 Realme 12 Pro+，安装的是 Android Studio Debug 版的 APP ，未主动安装过反诈 APP\n4. 我爸的手机\n国行 Samsung S22 ，安装的是 GitHub 上 release 版的 APP ，曾经安装过反诈 APP ，但是据我爸说在安装我的软件前已经卸载反诈 APP\n5. 我的主用电话卡\n插在我的主力机上，但是卡是落于我爸名下，但是我不清楚是否依旧被标记使用人是我\n6. 我的备用电话卡\n插在我的备用机上，实名认证是我\n7. 微信\n我在微信视频号上发布了一个关于我这个软件的介绍视频，并转发到了朋友圈，我的微信账号绑定的是我的主用电话卡\n细节\n反诈电话只打给了我，打的是我的主用电话卡，没有打给我爸，上来正确直呼了我的名字以及我做的软件名字。电话时间大概是我这个 APP 安装在我两部手机上一周后，是安装在我爸手机上约 3 天后，是我发布微信视频约 5 天后。\n最开始接到的是 96110 ，跟对方说明这个不是诈骗软件后，对方表示了解，并让我以后多注意一些。在挂断 96110 之后，街道公安打电话来了，表示要上访到家现场检查我的软件，但是因为我在学校，对方表示要把我这个情况反馈给上级，现无进一步通知。\n疑问\n为什么公安只打电话给我，并问我是不是我安装了这个软件，而从未询问过我爸？\n反诈中心是怎么评判一个软件是否是诈骗软件的？\n我在之前也做过很多小软件，不过都没有在我爸的手机上安装，为什么那些公安没有来查？\n我已经尽可能详细的写出所有细节，希望各位帮我想想到底是哪里出了问题？我个人觉得是视频号（但是要是完整看过这个视频，都不至于会认为这是个诈骗软件，因为这个视频已经把我这个软件的所有功能都演示过了）。\n我担心的不是反诈中心误杀了我这个软件，而是他们是怎么监测到我这个刚开发的软件的，在上述环节中总有一个地方被监测到了，我担心的是这个，并希望把这个隐藏的「威胁」清除。\n如果这个帖子还泄露了什么个人信息，烦请管理员帮忙删了，学生一枚，真的已经害怕了😨",

          "description": "最近楼上天天半夜噪音，一个月没怎么睡好，长带状疱疹，神经痛痛得我半夜嗷嗷叫，脾气很大。随便写点，不客观，没科学依据，没统计规律，就说几个认识的朋友。最好别封我，不然不知道去哪发疯。我也不是和他们一个圈子的，只是最近因为某些事情联系上了，发现我认为的精英们，竟然在苦恼这些，好吧我曾经也苦恼过现在淡定了。\n他们都是名校毕业，学理科，传统制造业和计算机行业。也都是价值观非常正派，求真务实，不坑蒙拐骗别人钱财和感情，不乱包装销售自己的人，于是也让自己非常非常的孤独，因为永远觉得自己不够好，永远没有准备好。\n不太幸福，也不快乐，永远焦虑，永远自我怀疑，钱多也焦虑，没钱也焦虑，优秀也焦虑，不优秀更焦虑。那种以为自己赚钱了就不焦虑的状态并达不到，为什么得到钱之后，还是焦虑。\n为什么亚洲人永远要活在成功学里面。中国理工科人，特别是男生，大概是当今全世界精神压力最高的群体，没有之一了。\n同学 1:\n父母清华的，家世太好，考试几乎门门都是满分，连语文都是只扣 2 分，扣的是作文，其他语文题都是满分。\n念书之后，那是念遍世界名校，最后也说卷的太累。以为人生就是一道又一道题，做好就行，最后发现，人生好像，不是做题欸。倒是父母给花的学费钱，要努力还给父母。不然自己以后换职业，都需要照顾父母面子。父母朋友都是那样，大学教授，单位中层干部，谁家的小孩，不是父母的面子呢，各家小孩，从小学就开始比，告诉我她从小就在的高要求下长大，不仅需要成绩好，连道德水平，待人接物，那是啥都要标准模板必须做到。进入社会才发现，原来事事可以做到 60 分，自己曾经努力的 100 分，是一种过度用力。为此感叹过去很多年，没有什么同龄人的生活，没有童年，青年欸。现在节奏慢下来，告诉我，哇，原来这才是人生啊。呜呜呜，原来可以这样简单做到啊。原来做到 60 分不是耻辱啊。\n同学 2：\n父母好像是保健品公司的小干部，父母爱卷的不行，他从小在家就和自己父母竞争上了。家里从来没有任何娱乐，父母不是在家学习工作，就是在外面参加行业活动，周末也不例外。这同学可能还是数学太好，从小竞赛金牌，一路保送至顶尖名校，现在熬出头了竟然告诉我说，看见代码心里就有阴影了。 一个多年搞竞赛，秒杀国内外竞赛的人，竟然看着自己最熟悉又擅长的东西，感到恐惧。同时因为自己形象太高大，出名之后，又太多学弟学妹的膜拜，自己反而不能做真实的自己了。在一个海边城市住，但是从来没去过海边，说永远有弄不完的项目，还是那句话，说自己没有生活。\n同学 3：\n父亲是公务员，同学本身成绩还可以，但是和前两个同学比，就算成绩普通的一般人。父亲一直让他考公务员，哇塞考 5 年了，考不上，同学都要精神崩溃了，给他讲了一下现在考的人太多了，胜算几率太小了，没事的不要逼迫自己。但是他真不行，在父亲面前，真是不敢说话。我真担心他就像新闻里面的那些考 n 年没上的人一样，精神崩溃了。\n总结：\n他们本身都很优秀，但是父母的确是时代红利，太过闪亮，他们别说超越父母，就和父母平起平坐都很困难。再加上自己说的，从小不知道什么是生活，彷佛，自己只要在一次又一次竞争中，得到胜利，就可以得到那个遥远的幸福。却说，当得到一切之后，自己已经失去了感知快乐的能力，只是把它当作一个任务完成了而已。\n还有，他们的父母好像都不允许他们，袒露自己的情感，不管是快乐的情感，还是悲伤，愤怒的情感，情感这块好像一直是一种压抑，未发育的状态。既无法表达自己的情感，可能是所处环境总是拒绝他们的情感需求，表达悲伤没有被安抚过，反而被父母说无用。所以早就关闭了这个情感通道，长大之后，也很难和其他人，建立深度的情感链接，不管是友情，还是亲密异性关系。哎~~父母太成功的小孩，真的有自我发展自己，生长成为一个自然形态的人的空间吗？不知道他们何时才能放下。幸福和快乐其实可以很简单。\n生活能把握住 60 分已经很不错了。不容易啊不容易。。",

          "description": "站长如何选择博客平台?在选择博客平台时，需要综合考虑多个因素，包括平台的易用性、功能、自定义能力、社区支持、成本以及是否满足个人或企业的特定需求 http://m.bokequ.com/list/22-0.html\n　　以下是一些建议，帮助您选择适合的博客平台：\n　　 1. 评估平台类型\n　　综合性平台\n　　优点：用户基数大，易于上手，提供丰富的模板和插件，SEO 优化较好，有助于内容推广。\n　　代表平台：新浪博客、博客园等。这些平台适合博客新手或偶尔写作的人。\n　　开源博客系统\n　　优点：提供高度的自定义能力，可以根据个人喜好设计博客的外观和功能，支持多平台同步发布。\n　　代表平台：WordPress 、Typecho 等。这些系统适合有一定写作经验和追求个性化的博主。\n　　专业内容平台\n　　优点：提供更高的流量和关注度，有助于内容的传播，同时提供丰富的商业合作机会。\n　　代表平台：知乎专栏、简书等。这些平台适合专业写手或自媒体人。\n　　 2. 考虑关键功能\n　　自定义能力：选择能够完全控制博客外观和功能的平台，如 WordPress 。\n　　 SEO 优化：确保平台具备良好的 SEO 性能，以便提高博客的可见性和访问量。\n　　社区支持：选择拥有活跃社区的平台，有助于内容分享和互动。\n　　插件和主题：查看平台是否提供丰富的插件和主题，以满足不同的功能需求和设计风格。\n　　 3. 成本考量\n　　免费与付费：许多平台提供免费和付费两种选项。免费选项通常有限制(如广告、存储限制等)，而付费选项则提供更多功能和更好的用户体验。\n　　长期成本：如果计划长期运营博客，需要考虑平台的升级费用、域名和服务器费用等长期成本。\n　　 4. 用户体验\n　　易用性：选择界面友好、易于操作的平台，以便快速上手和高效管理博客。\n　　编辑器功能：特别是对于喜欢使用 Markdown 等轻量级标记语言的用户，需要选择支持 Markdown 的编辑器。\n　　 5. 特定需求\n　　内容类型：如果主要发布图片、视频等多媒体内容，需要选择支持这些媒体类型的平台。\n　　国际化需求：如果博客面向全球受众，需要选择支持多语言和多地区的平台。\n　　 6. 示例对比\n　　以 WordPress 为例，它提供了广泛的自定义选项、强大的插件生态系统和 SEO 友好性，但需要一定的技术知识和资源投入。而知乎专栏则是一个适合专业和深度内容创作者的平台，拥有广泛的受众和友好的用户界面。\n　　总结：选择博客平台时，请根据您的个人或企业需求、技术水平、成本预算以及长期规划进行综合考虑。通过比较不同平台的优缺点，选择最适合您的博客平台。同时，记得定期评估和调整您的博客平台策略，以适应不断变化的网络环境和市场需求。",

          "description": "在 React 世界里，useEffect 和 useState 无疑是最常见的钩子（ Hooks ），它们让函数组件拥有了类组件的力量。useState 赋予了组件维护状态的能力，而 useEffect 则让副作用管理变得简单。\n对许多开发者来说，上述两个 Hooks 是 React 钩子的入门级应用，但随着项目复杂度的提升，仅仅使用这两个钩子可能会让组件变得臃肿，逻辑复杂难以维护。此时，众多开源社区的 React Hooks 库应运而生，它们提供了许多高质量、语义化的 Hooks ，帮助开发者更好地管理组件状态、副作用等，提升代码质量。@shined/react-use 就是这样一款优秀的 React Hooks 库。\n本文旨在充分利用 @shined/react-use 提供的 Hooks ，呈现一份全面的基于 React Hooks 的代码质量提升指南，引导你走出 useEffect 和 useState 的舒适区，发掘 React Hooks 的真正潜力和灵活性，提升项目代码质量。\n替换 useState\nuseState 是 React 中用来管理组件状态的 Hook ，基本上每个 React 开发者都会用到。\n但是低版本 React 中的 useState 可能导致非预期的行为。比如在 React <= 17 时，当组件卸载后，调用 setState 会抛出令人困惑的警告（参考 安全状态）。此外，React 内部使用浅比较来判断状态是否改变，这可能会导致组件进行不必要的重渲染，从而影响性能。\nuseSafeState\nuseSafeState 被设计为 useState 的直接替代方案，用于规避低版本 React 下的警告问题，并遵循官方做法在高版本 React 下与 useState 行为保持一致。\n同时它还具备可选的性能优化特性（deep 选项，深度比较状…",

A request that arrives sooner than 100ms after the previous one is put in a queue, and here we are setting the queue size to 20.\n\nThat means if 21 requests arrive from a given IP address simultaneously, NGINX forwards the first one to the upstream server group immediately and puts the remaining 20 in the queue. It then forwards a queued request every 100ms, and returns 503 to the client only if an incoming request makes the number of queued requests go over 20.\n\n结合代码和这段文字，我对 burst 的理解是：\n6r/m：以每 1 分钟为一个时间阶段，将这 1 分钟分为 6 段，即每 10s 最多接收 1 个请求，该 10s 内的多余请求将会被返回 503 ；\nburst=5：突发队列长度=5 。以每 1 分钟为一个时间阶段，在这 1 分钟内，该队列最多只能接受 5 个请求，即使该队列内的请求已经被处理，也不会往队列里新增新的请求，直到下 1 分钟到来。\n测试\n测试工具：jmeter \n\n预期结果：\n在 120s 内，一共发起了 120 个请求，其中请求成功 22 个(6+6+5+5)，其余返回 503 ；\n实际测试结果：\n在 120s 内，一共发起了 120 个请求，其中请求成功 17 个(6+6+5)，其余返回 503 ；\n为什么少了 5 个请求，希望大佬们为我指点下，谢谢~",

          "description": "《异形》是一系列科幻恐怖电影。首集《异形》（Alien，1979年）由雷德利·斯科特执导，之后又推出了三部续集《异形2》（Aliens，1986年）、《异形3》（Alien 3，1992年）、《异形4》（Alien: Resurrection，1997年）以及一部独立间传《异形：夺命舰》（Alien: Romulus，2024年）；雷德利·斯科特还执导了异形的前传系列《普罗米修斯》（Prometheus，2012年）和《异形：契约》（Alien: Covenant，2017年）。\n\r\n\r\n异形1\n\r\n\r\n2122年，商业太空船“诺斯特罗莫号”在航行途中收到了一组不明信号，飞船前往信号源地进行搜救，船员们在神秘星球的调查过程中，意外释放了一种致命的外星生物“异形”，“诺斯特罗莫号”的船员们不得不与异形展开了一场惊心动魄的战斗。\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n异形2\n\r\n\r\n延续了前作的恐怖氛围，讲述了女主角在57年后（2179年）被救回地球后，与一支海军陆战队一起返回被异形入侵的殖民星球，与异形进行殊死搏斗的故事。\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n异形3\n\r\n\r\n剧情紧接着第二部，2179年，女主角逃亡的飞船出现意外，坠落在一个阴冷黑暗的星球上，这个星球是一个关押犯人的太空监狱，只有一群被遗弃的囚犯和看守，异形也侵入了这个星球，由于这个星球上没有现代武器和科技，女主角和囚犯们只能依靠原始的工具来对抗异形。\n\r\n\r\n更糟糕的是，女主角发现，在她体内还有一只雌性异形正在成长，最后，女主角和已经破体而出的异形一起投入了高温熔炉同归于尽。\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n异形4\n\r\n\r\n2379年，女主角死亡后200年，在一艘名叫“贝蒂”的太空船上，科学家们通过克隆技术复活了女主角，并从她体内取出了异形女王的胚胎。\n\r\n\r\n科学家们希望利用异形进行研究，但事情很快失控，异形逃脱并开始猎杀船员，女主角和一群雇佣兵联手对抗这个致命的恐怖生物。\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n普罗米修斯\n\r\n\r\n《异形》的前传，故事发生在2089年，考古学家伊丽莎白·肖和同事在苏格兰的斯凯岛找到了一份星图，在韦兰公司的赞助下组建一支探险队，搭乘“普罗米修斯号”飞船出发前往星图所指引的行星LV-223，查找制造人类的“工程师”外星人，试图揭开人类起源的谜团。\n\r\n\r\n飞船飞行过程中船员都处于休眠状态，由人形机器人大卫监控旅程，飞船于2093年到达目的地，结果发现外星人制造了一种黑色液体的生物武器想要毁灭地球上的人类，女考古学家带领普罗米修斯号撞击外星飞船以阻止外星人的企图，而外星人最终被巨型抱脸虫杀死，并生下了第一个异形。\n\r\n\r\n2094年，女考古学家和机器人大卫一同开着外星飞船前往外星人的母星，了解为什么他们要毁灭人类。\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n异形：契约\n\r\n\r\n《普罗米修斯》的续集，2094年，女考古学家和机器人大卫在前往外星人母星的途中，由于拥有自主意识的大卫改变想法，害死了女考古学家，并将黑色病原体遍布外星人母星，致使他们种族灭绝，大卫则留在该星球进行研发异形的实验，成功用黑色病原体创造出各种异形生物。\n\r\n\r\n2104年，“契约号”殖民太空船载有15名船员和2000名殖民者前往欧瑞伽六号星球，因收到不明消息，船员们决定改变航线，前往信号发出的星球进行探索。\n\r\n\r\n在那里，他们遇到了《普罗米修斯》中的机器人大卫，并遭到异形的感染和袭击，在契约号船员对抗异形的过程中，机器人大卫蒙骗了他们，并混入契约号，带着异形胚胎，独自驾驶着契约号飞往目的地。\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n异形：夺命舰\n\r\n\r\n《异形系列》的第七部电影作品，故事发生在《异形1》剧情后的20年，2142年，一艘韦兰德太空探测器调查了二十年前被摧毁的诺斯特罗莫号的残骸，科学家打开了陨石，里面有一只异形。\n\r\n\r\n几个月后，一群年轻的太空殖民者，为了逃离殖民地，前往探索一艘废弃的公司太空船时，意外遭遇了宇宙中最恐怖的生命体：“异形”。",

          "description": "魔兽世界国服回归后，新版本《地心之战》即将登场，网易推增值服务“网易DD”提供带打服务，疑似官方下场参与RMT（Real Money Trading，即现实货币交易）事件，在玩家社区中引起了广泛的关注和讨论。\n\r\n\r\n事件概述\n\r\n\r\n网易有爱是网易官方推出的一个魔兽世界插件整合包，类似魔兽世界大脚插件或CurseForge，在国服重开之后，“网易有爱”更名为“网易DD”，并且重做了客户端，加入了更多的板块，8月22日，网易DD首页推出了一项增值服务，是以抢卷的方式为玩家提供H菲莱克地带打服务，原来30元的价格，降到0.01元，相当于用一分钱就让玩家体验其他工作室带打服务。另外，客服会强调这是官方团队，并且把这次的H菲莱克形容为“公益团”的带打行为。\n\r\n\r\n对此，玩家对此反应强烈，认为官方下场RMT破坏了游戏的平衡性和公平性，直接触及了游戏公平性和玩家体验的底线，使得游戏环境变得更加恶劣。同时，这也引发了玩家对网易运营能力和游戏未来的担忧。\n\r\n\r\n官方回应\n\r\n\r\n8月22日，网易运营团队在国服《魔兽世界》官网发布公告表示，此前引发大量玩家讨论的网易 DD“找人带带”活动已经下线。公告原文如下：\n\r\n\r\n\r\n亲爱的玩家：\n\r\n\r\n今日，网易《魔兽世界》官方运营团队收到玩家社区反馈，网易互联网新产品“网易DD”上线了暑期活动“找人带带”，并引发大量玩家讨论。我们第一时间与网易 DD 的同事们展开沟通，经协商，目前该活动已经下线。\n\r\n\r\n网易DD是网易集团旗下独立运营的工具软件，目前处于内测阶段，其运营行为具备自主性。在本次活动开展前，集团内部缺少及时的同步沟通，因此对社区造成了困扰，我们深感抱歉。\n\r\n\r\n未来我们将强化对各类工具软件的合作沟通机制及监督流程，始终把游戏的长期健康发展和服务广大玩家需求作为唯一目标，杜绝再次出现此类导致游戏社区困扰的活动。\n\r\n\r\n\r\n对游戏生态的影响\n\r\n\r\n根据国服暴雪战网最终用户许可协议1.C.iii.条款，战网用户同意不利用平台或游戏作为任何未被本协议授权的商业用途，包括以代练、租借通行证或游戏账号等形式进行游戏相关的服务以换取酬劳。\n\r\n\r\nRMT行为在网络游戏中有着复杂且深远的影响，以下是一些主要的方面：\n\r\n\r\n游戏公平性受损：RMT行为的存在使得玩家可以通过现实货币直接购买游戏内的优势资源或服务，从而破坏了游戏的公平竞争原则。\n\r\n\r\n玩家体验下降：对于坚持通过自身努力提升游戏水平的玩家来说，RMT行为无疑是一种打击。他们可能会因为无法与RMB玩家竞争而感到沮丧和失望。这可能导致非付费玩家失去游戏兴趣，影响游戏的用户基数和社区健康。\n\r\n\r\n破坏经济系统：RMT行为会破坏游戏内的经济平衡，一些玩家通过购买强力装备或虚拟货币获取优势，而不需要花费相应的时间和精力。这会导致游戏内的竞争失衡，可能让那些靠努力获取资源的玩家感到不公。\n\r\n\r\n深层原因\n\r\n\r\n虽然RMT行为在某些方面可能为工作室公司带来短期经济收益，但从长远看，游戏工作室对一款网络游戏的生命具有极大的破坏力，工作室会破坏游戏的平衡性和公平性，导致玩家流失，会大大缩减游戏的寿命，影响游戏的整体健康发展。游戏的开发商和运营商通常会采取有效的措施来限制工作室的活动，以确保游戏的可持续发展。\n\r\n\r\n既然如此，为什么网易为什么还要官方下场参与RMT行为呢？这和目前的市场环境有很大关系。\n\r\n\r\n目前的经济政策在一定程度上影响了企业的行为模式，导致一些企业倾向于追求短期利益，喜欢赚快钱，不肯投太多钱搞研发，喜欢偷别人的技术。\n\r\n\r\n经济政策朝令夕改，具有极大的不确定性，这种不确定性使得企业难以进行长期规划，因为未来的政策可能会突然改变市场环境，导致企业前期投资大量损失，为了应对这种不确定性，企业可能更倾向于短期快速获利，赚快钱，而不是进行长期投资，忽视了长期的品牌建设和可持续发展。\n\r\n\r\n网易做为一家庞大的游戏企业，也喜欢赚快钱。由于长时间的政策性风险，能够存活下来的网易，在结构性上就只有运营赚快钱游戏的经验，给它一个需要长期运营的游戏，它根本就不知道怎么才能有效运营，它从根本上还是打算执行运营一个只能存活1、2年的游戏的策略，只倾向于追求短期利益，而从不考虑长远发展，这就是网易为什么要做出这种让玩家匪夷所思行为的深层原因。\n\r\n\r\n结语\n\r\n\r\n综上所述，网易《魔兽世界》疑似官方下场RMT事件对游戏生态和玩家体验造成了严重影响，网易应该及时悬崖勒马，亡羊补牢，采取积极措施来应对此事件，确保游戏环境的公平性和健康性，同时也应加强与玩家之间的沟通和交流，共同推动游戏的持续健康发展。",
