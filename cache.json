          "description": "Hi,\nI created httpdbg, a tool for Python developers to easily debug HTTP(S) client requests in Python programs.\nI developed it because I needed a tool that could help me trace the HTTP requests sent by my tests back to the corresponding methods in our API client.\nThe goal of this tool is to simplify the debugging process, so I designed it to be as simple as possible. It requires no external dependencies, no setup, no superuser privileges, and no code modifications.\nI'm sharing it with you today because I use it regularly, and it seems like others have found it useful too—so it might be helpful for you as well.\nHope you will like it.\ncle\nSource: https://github.com/cle-b/httpdbg\nDocumentation: https://httpdbg.readthedocs.io/\nA blog post on a use case: https://medium.com/@cle-b/trace-all-your-http-requests-in-py...\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41650905\nPoints: 73\n# Comments: 30",

          "description": "Hey HN! We're Raymond Xu and Raffi Isanians, the team behind Modern Realty (https://modernrealty.io). Modern Realty is an AI-powered real estate buying experience that helps you purchase homes without relying on a traditional realtor. Demo: https://youtu.be/VhsWSVn5blA\nOur mission at Modern Realty is to make home buying easier, faster, and far more enjoyable. We interpret real estate data, giving you an edge on other home buyers.\nSince 2024, there has been a growing need for innovative solutions in real estate, especially with tools like Zillow making it easier than ever for buyers to find the right house at the right price. However, the process still requires an agent, even though buyers are doing most of the work themselves. Modern Realty changes this by offering an AI self-service solution.\nRaymond and Raffi came face-to-face with this technology's potential while working on AI at Google and handling billion-dollar asset transactions as an attorney, respectively. The AI tools we've built guide users through every step of the home-buying process, from scheduling showings to making offers, all without the need for a traditional agent.\nBefore we expand further, this summer we've built our core AI real estate agent, which can handle everything from disclosure summaries to competitive market analyses. You can see our platform in action at https://modernrealty.io. We're particularly proud of our offer generation tool, which creates offers that are then reviewed by an attorney at no additional cost.\nWe're excited to be launching here on HN and would love to hear what you think! If you're in the market for a new home or just curious about the future of real estate, visit our website or schedule a call with us to get started.\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41638199\nPoints: 90\n# Comments: 187",

          "description": "Hey HN! We’re Emma and Chris, founders of Velvet (https://www.usevelvet.com).\nVelvet proxies OpenAI calls and stores the requests and responses in your PostgreSQL database. That way, you can analyze logs with SQL (instead of a clunky UI). You can also set headers to add caching and metadata (for analysis).\nBackstory: We started by building some more general AI data tools (like a text-to-SQL editor). We were frustrated by the lack of basic LLM infrastructure, so ended up pivoting to focus on the tooling we wanted. So many existing apps, like Helicone, were hard to use as power users. We just wanted a database.\nScale: We’ve already warehoused 50m requests for customers, and have optimized the platform for scale and latency. We’ve built the proxy on Cloudflare Workers, and latency is nominal. We’ve built some “yak shaving” features that were really complex such as decomposing OpenAI Batch API requests so you can track each log individually. One of our early customers (https://usefind.ai/) makes millions of OpenAI requests per day, up to 1500 requests per second.\nVision: We’re trying to build development tools that have as little UI as possible, that can be controlled entirely with headers and code. We also want to blend cloud and on-prem for the best of both worlds — allowing for both automatic updates and complete data ownership.\nHere are some things you can do with Velvet logs:\n- Observe requests, responses, and latency\n- Analyze costs by metadata, such as user ID\n- Track batch progress and speed\n- Evaluate model changes\n- Export datasets for fine-tuning of gpt-4o-mini\n(this video shows how to do each of those: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KaFkRi5ESi8)\n--\nTo see how it works, try chatting with our demo app that you can use without logging in: https://www.usevelvet.com/sandbox\nSetting up your own proxy is 2 lines of code and takes ~5 mins.\nTry it out and let us know what you think!\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41637550\nPoints: 8\n# Comments: 2",

          "description": "Hi HN!\nI made a live presidential polling website with real-time electoral results. Votes can be changed at any time until the poll closes. Only visitors from the USA can participate. Congressional district is detected automatically.\nThe idea is to enable a coordinated voting process, where selections are non-binding and negotiable rather than blindly cast once. Kind of like a presidential caucus, but national and over the Internet.\nThe infra is Fastly & DigitalOcean. Backend is a Django service running on DO App Platform with Postgres. Fastly is used for edge logic, captcha, geo location, and pushing updates to the page (Fanout). In theory it should be able to handle millions of participants.\nNote: since my previous post, I've added a way to close the poll after a time period. I realized that without some kind of time boxing it was unclear what the point is or how long to participate.\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41630976\nPoints: 4\n# Comments: 1",

          "description": "Hey HN, we recently fine-tuned the llama3.1 405B model on 8xAMD MI300x GPUs using JAX instead of PyTorch. JAX's advanced sharding APIs allowed us to achieve great performance. Check out our blog post to learn about the cool sharding tricks we used. We've also open-sourced the code: https://github.com/felafax/felafax\nWe're a small startup building AI infra for fine-tuning and serving LLMs on non-NVIDIA hardware (TPUs, AMD, Trainium).\nProblem: Many companies are trying to get PyTorch working on AMD GPUs, but we believe this is a treacherous path. PyTorch is deeply intertwined with the NVIDIA ecosystem in a lot of ways (e.g., `torch.cuda` or scaled_dot_product_attention is an NVIDIA CUDA kernel exposed as a PyTorch function). So, to get PyTorch code running on non-NVIDIA hardware, there's a lot of \"de-NVIDIAfying\" that needs to be done.\nSolution: We believe JAX is a better fit for non-NVIDIA hardware. In JAX, ML model code compiles to hardware-independent HLO graphs, which are then optimized by the XLA compiler before hardware-specific optimization. This clean separation allowed us to run the same LLaMA3 JAX code both on Google TPUs and AMD GPUs with no changes.\nOur strategy as a company is to invest upfront in porting models to JAX, then leverage its framework and XLA kernels to extract maximum performance from non-NVIDIA backends. This is why we first ported Llama 3.1 from PyTorch to JAX, and now the same JAX model works great on TPUs and runs perfectly on AMD GPUs.\nWe'd love to hear your thoughts on our vision and repo!\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41630913\nPoints: 12\n# Comments: 0",

It's about how to organize programs around data \"as plain data\" and the surprisingly benefits that emerge when we do. Programs that are built around the data they manage tend to be simpler, smaller, and significantly easier understand.\nJava has changed radically over the last several years. It has picked up all kinds of new language features which support data oriented programming (records, pattern matching, `with` expressions, sum and product types). However, this is not a book about tools. No amount of studying a screw-driver will teach you how to build a house. This book focuses on house building. We'll pick out a plot of land, lay a foundation, and build upon it house that can weather any storm.\nDoP is based around a very simple idea, and one people have been rediscovering since the dawn of computing, \"representation is the essence of programming.\" When we do a really good job of capturing the data in our domain, the rest of the system tends to fall into place in a way which can feel like it’s writing itself.\nThat's my elevator pitch! The book is currently in early access. I hope you check it out. I'd love to hear your feedback.\nYou can get 50% off (thru October 9th) with code `mlkiehl`\nhttps://www.manning.com/books/data-oriented-programming-in-j...\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41629377\nPoints: 217\n# Comments: 64",

Working with startups, doing interviews and sifting through endless software reviews are daunting tasks. So, we built a chatbot that lets you chat with over 3 million reviews from more than 100K SaaS products.\nWith Reviewradar, you can ask questions like:\n- create a comprehensive SWOT analysis for both Notion and Obsidian\n- give me negative feedback and complaints you have about Postmark\n- summarise the reviews you have on products in the OCR category\nI would love to get your feedback on it. Check it out here: https://reviewradar.ai\nLooking forward to your thoughts / suggestions,\nAndrei and Roman\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41616763\nPoints: 76\n# Comments: 35",

          "description": "Hi HN!  I’m Tony, one of the co-founders of Inngest (https://inngest.com/)\nInngest is an open-source durable workflow platform that works on any cloud.  Durable workflows are stateful, long running step functions written in code, which automatically retry on failure.  It abstracts everything about queues, event streams and state for you, letting you focus on code.  Some examples of uses:  managing stateful AI chained step functions;  managing search/rag indexes and data pipelines;  integrations and webhooks;  billing and payment flows.\nTechnical details:  unlike other solutions, we put lots of effort into designing our SDK’s step.run APIs to make them extremely easy to use — developer experience is the most important thing for us.\nWe had to design and build our own queueing system to work with multi-tenancy, batching, and debouncing, and we’re iterating on this as we move to FoundationDB.  It’s largely all Go in the backend, with a bunch of caching, clickhouse, event streams, and coordination on our behalf.  Workers are shared nothing, and run based off of the queue and execution state.\nWe did a post last year as we iterated on our TS SDK.  The product has changed a lot since then and wanted to show the community what’s changed as we reach 1.0:\n    * Golang, Java, and Python SDKs with cross-language function invocation (across clouds, too)\n\n    * Multi-tenant aware flow control (concurrency, throttling, debounce)\n\n    * Batching, grouping many events into a single function call\n\n    * Much improved dashboard, with tracing and metrics built in\n\n    * Advanced recovery tools like function replay, temporary pausing,  bulk cancellation (with optional expressions).  No more dead letter queues!\n\n    * Branch deploys built in, with staging env support out of the box\n\n    * Full local testing with production parity\n\n\nWanted to say thank you to the HN community for feedback so far!  Happy Friday :)\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41604042\nPoints: 83\n# Comments: 26",

          "description": "We just released a very excited touch sensor that finally simplifies touch sensing for robotics.\nOur most exciting result: Learned visuotactile policies for precise tasks like inserting USBs and credit card swiping, that work out-of-the-box when you replace skins! To the best of our knowledge, this has never been shown before with any existing tactile sensor.\nWhy is this important? For the first time, you could now collect data and train models on one sensor and expect them to generalize to new copies of the sensor -- opening the door to the kind of large foundation models that have revolutionized vision and language reasoning.\nWould love to hear the community's questions, thoughts and comments!\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41603865\nPoints: 166\n# Comments: 26",

          "description": "Numscript is a simple, declarative language that helps you model financial transactions. You can do quite a few things with it, such as modeling:\n* Payments involving vouchers and a user's prepaid balance\n* Complex funds destination scenario where the customer gets cash back\n* Configurable user credit balance spending transactions\nThe main idea is to take the pain out of describing of a system dealing with money movements should behave in traditional languages such as JS/TS/Go/Ruby etc, landing an expressive way to model these movements of value.\nIt is voluntarily broad in applicability—our customers use it today for use-cases ranging from marketplaces funds orchestration to home-grown loan management systems.\nOnce those transactions are modeled, they are to be picked up and committed to a system-of-record, ledgering system or executed on a set of payments and banking APIs.\nIt was initially a DSL we bundled into our Core Ledger product at Formance (YCS21) but we're giving it more autonomy now and started to make it standalone, with the idea that anyone could eventually bolt Numscript on top of their ledgering system. We're also exploring to make it natively compatible with other backends.\nAs part of this un-bundling, we've just shipping a playground which lets you fiddle with it without installing anything at https://playground.numscript.org/ (it works best on desktop).\nHappy to chime in on any questions!\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41593216\nPoints: 103\n# Comments: 21",

          "description": "Hi HN,\nWe are Cyril & Ulric and are building Marblism (https://marblism.com), an LLM-based dev platform to generate and iterate on full-stack web apps.\nHere’s a demo video that goes from a comment on Twitter to a working app in 10 minutes: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TapOPO-Gv20.\nMarblism started when we realized that much of the code we write for web apps is just slightly modified boilerplate: similar login flows, dashboards, API integrations, CRUD operations, etc. While AI tools are helpful, they fall short in delivering a well-architected codebase. The idea of Marblism is to combine the best of both worlds: a solid boilerplate, customized and enhanced with AI.\nHere's how it works:\nGenerate your app -  Describe your product, and the AI will build your data model. We create a NextJS app with auth, custom CRUDs, permissions, payment, emails. The AI then generates your front-end pages.\nTest and improve your app - Now that your app is set up, use our online workspace to test your app and add more complex features via an AI Chat or directly yourself in the VSCode editor.\nGo live - Once you’re happy with your app, deploy it in production in one click.\nHere are some examples of apps generated on Marblism in couple of hours of prompting:\nFind and validate startup ideas: https://www.muckbrass.com/\nA design system directory: https://awesomedesignsystem.app.io\nAI-Personalized candle: https://www.scent-a-scene.com/\nMarblism currently generates web apps like SaaS, marketplaces, and social networks. It doesn't support Chrome extensions or mobile apps, and it’s not really for small games like Snake/Tetris.\nThe vision is to add more tech stacks later this year and enable people to create their own templates/tech stack that the AI can customize.\nWe’re really excited to share this with you and we'd love to hear your thoughts on the potential directions we can take this product.\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41568343\nPoints: 81\n# Comments: 58",

          "description": "Hey HN! I'm Caleb, one of the contributors to Opik, a new open source framework for LLM evaluations.\nOver the last few months, my colleagues and I have been working on a project to solve what we see as the most painful parts of writing evals for an LLM application. For this initial release, we've focused on a few core features that we think are the most essential:\n- Simplifying the implementation of more complex LLM-based evaluation metrics, like Hallucination and Moderation.\n- Enabling step-by-step tracking, such that you can test and debug each individual component of your LLM application, even in more complex multi-agent architectures.\n- Exposing an API for \"model unit tests\" (built on Pytest), to allow you to run evals as part of your CI/CD pipelines\n- Providing an easy UI for scoring, annotating, and versioning your logged LLM data, for further evaluation or training.\nIt's often hard to feel like you can trust an LLM application in production, not just because of the stochastic nature of the model, but because of the opaqueness of the application itself. Our belief is that with better tooling for evaluations, we can meaningfully improve this situation, and unlock a new wave of LLM applications.\nYou can run Opik locally, or with a free API key via our cloud platform. You can use it with any model server or hosted model, but we currently have a built-in integration with the OpenAI Python library, which means it automatically works not just with OpenAI models, but with any model served via a compatible model server (ollama, vLLM, etc). Opik also currently has out-of-the-box integrations with LangChain, LlamaIndex, Ragas, and a few other popular tools.\nThis is our initial release of Opik, so if you have any feedback or questions, I'd love to hear them!\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41567192\nPoints: 57\n# Comments: 9",

I'm especially curious about more recent examples of specific devices that run L4 variants (seL4, PikeOS, OKL4, etc.).  I already found a few that use seL4, but to take OKL4 as an example, most of the specific devices I could find are from more than a decade ago, and I'm trying to find things from at least the last 5 or 6 years.  I'm even more curious to find devices that use a form of L4 as a hypervisor.\nHas anyone here worked on a device that used an L4-related kernel or hypervisor?  I know one major area they're used in is defense and full of NDAs, but hopefully some of the other industries they're used in (medical devices, automotive, IoT) are a little less restrictive.

Some of our recent hurricane forecasts can be visualized at https://hurricanes2024.silurian.ai/.\nWhat is it worth to know the weather forecast 1 day earlier? That’s not a hypothetical question, traditional forecasting systems have been improving their skill at a rate of 1 day per decade. In other words, today’s 6-day forecast is as accurate as the 5-day forecast ten years ago. No one expects this rate of improvement to hold steady, it has to slow down eventually, right? Well in the last couple years GPUs and modern deep learning have actually sped it up.\nSince 2022 there has been a flurry of weather deep learning system…",

Its inspired by both GraphQL and SQL, but implemented using javascript Proxies. Instead of creating a new language, its all just javascript.\nI've made it as part of an experimental database, which uses javascript as the query engine. The normal javascript map/reduce/sort functions are quite difficult to master for junior developers.

          "description": "After working with LLMs for long enough, I found myself wanting a lightweight utility for doing various small tasks to prepare inputs, locate information and create evaluators. This library is two things: a very simple model and utilities that inference it (eg. fuzzy deduplication). The target platform is CPU, and it’s intended to be light, fast and pip installable — a library that lowers the barrier to working with strings semantically. You don’t need to install pytorch to use it, or any deep learning runtimes.\nHow can this be accomplished? The model is simply token embeddings that are average pooled. To create this model, I extracted token embedding (nn.Embedding) vectors from LLMs, concatenated them along the embedding dimension, added a learnable weight parameter, and projected them to…",

Super repairable, of course.

Whenever possible, I’ve been trying to use Claude as a first pass when implementing new features / changes. But I found that depending on the type of change I was making, I was spending a lot of thought finding and deciding which source files should be included in the prompt. The need to copy/paste each file individually also becomes a mild annoyance.\nFirst, I implemented `repogather --all` , which unintelligently copies all sources files in your repository to the clipboard (delimited by their relative filepaths). To my surprise, for less complex repositories, this alone is often completely workable for Claude — much better than pasting in the just the few files you …",

          "description": "Hey HN, we wanted to share our repo where we fine-tuned Llama 3.1 on Google TPUs. We’re building AI infra to fine-tune and serve LLMs on non-NVIDIA GPUs (TPUs, Trainium, AMD GPUs).\nThe problem: Right now, 90% of LLM workloads run on NVIDIA GPUs, but there are equally powerful and more cost-effective alternatives out there. For example, training and serving Llama 3.1 on Google TPUs is about 30% cheaper than NVIDIA GPUs.\nBut developer tooling for non-NVIDIA chipsets is lacking. We felt this pain ourselves. We initially tried using PyTorch XLA to train Llama 3.1 on TPUs, but it was rough: xla integration with pytorch is clunky, missing libraries (bitsandbytes didn't work), and cryptic HuggingFace errors.\nWe then took a different route and translated Llama 3.1 from PyTorch to JAX. Now, it’s running smoothly on TPUs! We still have challenges ahead, there is no good LoRA library in JAX, but this feels like the right path forward.\nHere's a demo (https://dub.sh/felafax-demo) of our managed solution.\nWould love your thoughts on our repo and vision as we keep chugging along!\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41512142\nPoints: 68\n# Comments: 19",

          "description": "Hey Hacker News! We’re Abhi and Alex from deepsilicon (https://deepsilicon.com). We are building software and hardware for training and inferencing ternary transformer models. Here's a video of the software: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqBn-I5D6pk.\nTransformer-based models are getting bigger every generation, making the inference hardware requirements more and more expensive. Running large transformer models on device is even more challenging. Usually, they require trillions of FLOPs to run at decent speeds and use too much energy and space.\nOur solution is to train ternary transformer models. There are two advantages to using ternary values. The first is that the weights can now be stored in two bits (or even less) from 16 bits. This represents an almost 8x compression ratio for every…",

          "description": "Hey HN, this is Lina, Andrew, and Sidney from Infinity AI (https://infinity.ai/). We've trained our own foundation video model focused on people. As far as we know, this is the first time someone has trained a video diffusion transformer that’s driven by audio input. This is cool because it allows for expressive, realistic-looking characters that actually speak. Here’s a blog with a bunch of examples: https://toinfinityai.github.io/v2-launch-page/\nIf you want to try it out, you can either (1) go to https://studio.infinity.ai/try-inf2, or (2) post a comment in this thread describing a character and we’ll generate a video for you and reply with a link. For example: \n“Mona Lisa saying ‘what the heck are you smiling at?’”: https://bit.ly/3z8l1TM \n“A 3D pixar-style gnome with a pointy red hat r…",

          "description": "Hey all,\nI'm the founder of Flipt, an open-source  (https://github.com/flipt-io/flipt) feature flag tool that I (and others) have been working on for the past few years.\nAbout a year or two ago we added support for serving flag state from various non-relational declarative stores like Git, OCI, Object Store, etc.\nMany of our users came to love the git-backed storage, as it allows them to keep their feature flags close to their code in there organization's repos. But they had one (rather large) ask, and that was the ability to use the UI to manage flag state changes and still use Git as the backend.\nSo today we're rolling out our hosted solution that does exactly that (and more soon).\nI would love any feedback, questions, etc, or if anyone would give it a spin! Happy to extend the 14-day trial as well for anyone interested in providing product feedback.\nThanks!!\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41460061\nPoints: 10\n# Comments: 0",

          "description": "Hello, everyone!\nMy name is Alex, and I'm an expat in a new country. Two years ago, I moved to Germany where I didn’t know anyone. Starting the job, I realized that becoming close friends with colleagues can be quite challenging and slow. The feeling of loneliness was gradually growing.\nTo change that, I started attending various meetups based on my interests, hoping to make new friends. However, I often found myself answering the same generic questions that didn’t really help me understand if someone shared my values and interests. As a result, lost energy and 0 friends.\nSO - That’s when I began using icebreaking questions in smaller groups. Surprisingly, these questions quickly changed any conversation to a deeper, more engaging and meaningful level. I was able to identify people I genuinely connected with and started spending more time with them.\nBUT - preparing and using these questions was a pain. I would Google the top-100, pick a random number, and choose a question. I felt a strong need for a simple „one button“ that does everything for me.\nAND - After searching and not finding such a solution, I decided to build it myself. I created a vast database of questions across various topics and integrated AI to generate questions on any subject.\nThe idea has resonated well within my communities (university and expat parties), and more people are starting to use it. I’d love to hear your stories with icebreaking questions, your experience, and your feedback so I can make the service even more useful for more people!\nCheck it out and share your thoughts!\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41438542\nPoints: 17\n# Comments: 6",

Here’s a quick demo: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9n_eY-fM_E.\nWhy we’re doing this: Mechanical engineers excel at generating initial design concepts but get bogged down translating ideas into final designs due to tedious, repetitive tasks. Our goal is to automate these mundane processes, allowing engineers to focus on the creative aspects of design.\nHaving worked at multiple hardware companies—from medical devices to space launch vehicles—we know how often “trivial” components such as manufacturing rigging, get brushed under the table in scheduling conversations.  These tasks aren’t necessari…",

The settings closely follow html/css. We think an open canvas is a big improvement over other website builders. Everything is easier: styling, consistency, responsiveness…\nBut making it work was hard! We thought HN would appreciate the tech behind it:\n- A custom WebGL rendering engine (w/text, shadows, blurs, gradients, & opacity groups)\n- A partial implementation of the css spec\n- A custom text editor & text shaper\n- A transformer to turn designs into publishable html/css\nRepaint is a design tool for html/css.

This is an open source plasmid and vector (Short, often circular segments of DNA) editor, with features related to primer quality checks, PCR cloning, and protein analysis. I plan to add more restriction-enzyme-based features in the near future. It has some extras like a solution-mixing helper, automatic feature annotation.\nFrom a technical standpoint, this is a standalone binary written using the EGUI library in rust. A project goal is performance, with small memory footprint, and small application and file sizes.\nThis is a continuous work-in-progress, and I'm open to any and all feedback, criticism, and requested features.\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41435409\nPoints: 81\n# Comments: 20",

Basically, it wants to solve the problems encountered with current solutions:\n- slow typing\n- not easily configurable\n- keyboard layout dependent\n- constant bugs\nAdditionally, Afrim offers the following features [1]:\n- Dataset easily customizable\n- Keyboard layout independent\n- Auto completion, autocorrection and autosuggestion\n- Support all sequential codes\nTechnical details [2]:\nAfrim is written in Rust and his architecture is inspired of RIME.\nWhat's next?\n- Offer an android frontend of the Afrim (in development) [3]\n- Support more African input methods as possible\nI would like to have your opinions about this project. I have been working on it so far, and I would like to know how I can improve it.\n--------------\n[1] https://github.com/pythonbrad/afrim?tab=readme-ov-file#featu...\n[2] https://pythonbrad.github.io/afrim-man/for_developers\n[3] https://github.com/pythonbrad/afrim-keyboard/\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41427563\nPoints: 80\n# Comments: 33",

          "description": "Hi HN, We're excited to share repo2vec: a simple-to-use, modular library enabling you to chat with any public or private codebase. It's like Github Copilot but with the most up-to-date information about your repo.\nWe made this because sometimes you just want to learn how a codebase works and how to integrate it, without spending hours sifting through the code itself.\nWe tried to make it dead-simple to use. With two scripts, you can index and get a functional interface for your repo. Every generated response shows where in the code the context for the answer was pulled from.\nWe also made it plug-and-play where every component from the embeddings, to the vector store, to the LLM is completely customizable.\nIf you want to see a hosted version of the chat interface with its features, here's a link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNVzmqRXUCA\nWe would love your feedback!\n- Mihail and Julia\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41383592\nPoints: 22\n# Comments: 3",

I chose Zorin OS as it's the first distribution that comes to my mind (besides Pop!_OS) for people coming from Windows.\n The Moment\n I only configured general stuff (like Chrome, etc.) for her a couple of days ago, didn't get the time to give her a tour of the new setup with Zorin OS. Today, she told me over the phone that she had to install Visual Studio Code using a setup file she had lying around, but she managed to get it working, which is what shocked me. She still has no idea why I was impressed, but when she showed me around how she actually did it, I saw that it was literally a Windows setup EXE and it worked just as it does on Windows, without her realizing it usually doesn't work that way in Linux, at least natively.\n Look How Far We've Come!\n Newcomers to Linux may not realize how back in the day we had to set up Wine ourselves and yet things weren't as streamlined as it appears to be now. But still, this kind of \"backward compatibility\" in a Linux distribution, and that too out of the box such that a Windows user doesn't even face a hiccup clearly demonstrates how far we've come with Linux, even for a long-time Linux user like me. To say that I'm impressed would be an understatement! Meanwhile, I do not understand why Zorin OS receives all the hate, and to me, it hasn't received the love it deserves.\n PS: Sorry for the long post, but I had to get this out!\n    submitted by    /u/myTerminal_  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "The other day, I found myself reflecting on how far we've come from the early days when the only way to interact with a computer was through the command line. Nowadays, we have desktop environments, colorful and visually appealing applications, web apps, and social media. While it's impressive, I can't help but feel like the internet and computing in general have lost a bit of that 'wild west' charm.\n There's something fascinating, even mysterious, about interacting purely through text. It feels raw, direct, and oddly stimulating in a way that's very different from today's user-friendly graphical interfaces.\n So, I had this idea (though I haven't had the time to implement it yet due to work 😅): What if I stripped away all the modern graphical interfaces and returned to a fully command-line experience? Imagine surfing the web, talking to people, and interacting with the OS—all text-based, like the early days.\n Has anyone else experienced this feeling? Do any of you have experience living in this old-school, text-only world? Would love to hear your thoughts.\n    submitted by    /u/NonnoSi99  \n [link]   [comments]",

So, aside from the points I've mentioned, what are the other reasons people dislike Snap? Feel free to correct me if I'm wrong.\n Disclaimer: I am not defending Snap or Canonical in any way; I am just genuinely curious.\n Edit: I know there are multiple sources stating reasons why it is bad.

I've both seen people say you shouldn't expect Linux to be good for gaming, as that's not what it's meant for, and others who claim that it's very good with it. There's so much mixed messaging, and with a crowd that seems very ready to jump at one another, that's not a comfort. All this infighting feels like the history of China circa 1300s-1600s.\n I just wanted my taskbar on the left again ;-;\n On the user side it's been a pretty decent experience so far. The most difficult thing is that some settings seem very obscure or nonexistent (like telling a Wacom tablet to limit input to one window) - then terminal becomes necessary and online solutions don't work, so on\n But, when everything works, I am very much enjoying myself with Mint (w/ KDE Plasma). It just feels good.

Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) is then used to generate topic names for the contents in each category, resulting in the creation of corresponding folders names.

The compatibility issues with a lot of software can also be used against them trying to execute pirated games and the like, basically making it easier to control what they have access to.\n I know there are stories of how if you apply child protection time limits or website blocks they end up adapting and circumventing it...but if they do that with Linux, then they are also forced to learn how the system works well enough to familiarize themselves with programming knowledge which could help them in the future.\n    submitted by    /u/ChocodiIe  \n [link]   [comments]",

And popularly, the term has gained a multitude of meanings, for better or worse, and does not refer only to the Kernel. Linux, therefore, is a polysemic term and can be understood as:\n Linux: the kernel developed under the command of Linus Torvald\n Linux - based: a set of operating systems based on Linux – the kernel.

So, it's my third day back on Windows while I'm choosing my next distro and this is what I realized: modern Linux is drastically better than Windows in the user experience domain.\n  \nEven with flatpaks that are not designed to be fast and btrfs that is not built for speed either, apps load noticeably faster on Linux than on Windows. Tested on Firefox, LibreOffice, Gimp. Same SSD, different partitions.\n Incidentally, installing an app (LibreOffice again) on Linux does not require a reboot. I still can't believe that on Windows it does.\n Windows UI makes my eyes bleed and I can't do a thing about it without third party tools that are a can of worms in their own right. This especially applies to the taskbar.\n On Windows I can't switch the keyboard layout with one key like I do it on Linux. Since I do it hundreds of times every day, it's a problem.\n  \nI'll stop at this point to reiterate that no, we are not seeing things and not trying to convince ourselves of Linux advantages.

With how empty settings is, I just could not believe they would do something like that. It's complete horseshit with no purpose other than to make user experience worse. I have no idea why I was so attached to it or afraid to to switch over to linux. I think at the time, security was a worry for me (what will I do without windows defender?! oh dear!) but I can see now that's a total non-issue as long as you have a functioning brain and a firewall.\n It was a really difficult decision for me between Zorin and Mint, and Mint only won out last minute. Mint (cinnamon specifically) just does everything I want it to without any of the bloat. All my mainstay games are compatible with a little tweaking and effort. It's beautifully simple and customizable. I'm not being advertised to every five seconds. \n This is a sign: if you're a newbie, and you're sick of microsoft but too nervous to make the switch, just do it. Go with mint. It works great, and there's a massive community there to help you just in case you hit a bump in the road. You'll be glad you did it.\n Edit: I'm sorry I exaggerated about how positive my experience was. I was having fun. I don't understand what I did wrong to get comments like the ones I have but I'm sorry. I wasn't trying to \"jerk off\" the community.

I owned up to my mistake and brought a 990 Samsung 4TB. Installed Windows first, then tried NixOS for about an hour. Realizing I was way over my head - it's definitely a neat OS I'll probably try as a server OS, I installed Open Suse Leap again. \n I apologize to the Arch community here. I was warned by them it was probably a hardware issue about a month ago. However, I don't think I'm hardcore enough for a rolling distro as my daily driver.

          "description": "Hey everyone,\n IDK if you have the same problems, but I had an idea that might make screen sharing on Linux a lot more secure and private. Picture this: you’re sharing your screen on Discord, OBS, or any other screen share app, and you accidentally reveal something you didn’t mean to—like passwords or private files. It’s a common concern, and I think there might be a way to address it.\n What if we had a feature where you could easily mark parts of your screen as “sensitive,” and the compositor would automatically blur or hide those areas during screen sharing or recording? For example, you could set up certain regions or windows to be censored so that they don’t show up in the recording or stream.\n On top of that, we could take it a step further with machine learning. Imagine having a system that can automatically detect sensitive information—like passwords, IP addresses, or credit card numbers—and blur those parts in real-time. This way, you wouldn’t have to manually mark everything; the system could handle it based on common patterns.\n Does this sound useful to anyone else? I’d love to hear your thoughts or any ideas on how that could work.\n Looking forward to your feedback!\n    submitted by    /u/sporesirius  \n [link]   [comments]",

It might not be widely supported now, but that can change\n  \nIf I would give up any of these, it would the the fan. I could live with a fan if I can throttle the chips because computing power is not a strong requirement for me.\n TLDR: I need an awesome traveling computer as a replacement for the MBAir. I’m weary of everything corporations are doing and want to opt out of the surveillance model, but I’m a sucker for convenience.\n p.s: I love the modern Gnome experience as a decades-old MacOS user.\n    submitted by    /u/choochoomthfka  \n [link]   [comments]",

I wrote this tool which allows you to create a virtual linux device for any of your androids kernel devices.\n Though apart from using android tablet as wacom like external tablet, I can't find any other use cases (maybe you have one ?). Other than useless but kinda cool things like being able to detect when your headphone jack is unplugged, or use your phones touch screen on your linux machine.\n The ux is in need of tlc but I wanted to post about this as I would love for people to test out there own devices.

          "description": "One of the big things I see keeping people from using Linux as their only desktop OS is the unavailability of Photoshop (and other Adobe Products) on Linux. Now granted, I don't really know anything about photo editing or graphic design but based on what I read from people who do graphic design professionally, GIMP just isn't up to snuff as far as features and workflow even with the new 3.0 coming. \n I learned about Photopea a couple years ago and it looks a much better alternative to Photoshop as far as workflow and features (CMYK, smart objects, AI features). The issue I see people might have it with it is it being web based and proprietary though it does edit your photos offline and is big on privacy.\n With all this in mind, for graphic design people wanting to switch to Linux should we be steering them more towards Photopea rather than GIMP despite it being proprietary and web based?\n Keep in mind I ask this as someone who knows next to nothing about graphic design or photo editing, just a huge Linux enthusiast so I would be very interested to hear thoughts from people who know more than me and/or have used both Photoshop and Photopea.\n    submitted by    /u/jmantra623  \n [link]   [comments]",

It’s just annoying. I guess it comes down to security? Would tethered connectivity be easier and more open in Linux? All I want to do is have some basic bare bones software automatically copy certain new files when it’s connected — but otherwise leave me alone :-) with windows it seems like I need special software to accomplish what I want = extra complicated.

I know there also alternatives like the le potato priced at 35 bucks, but is that the cheapest or are there cheaper than that? Im looking for something that acts just like a computer or server similar to the pi, and where might i get said board/tech at?\n Im a 18 year old student who wants to get into some tech and the pi caught my interests but its too pricey, also my parents dont really see a point to a board like the pi, so im curious of how i can convince them to let me get one? if they dont understand it.\n    submitted by    /u/Gaming-invisibleman  \n [link]   [comments]",

Imagine international-level internet outage caused by kernel bug. Linux community would be instantly die after that 😓\n So please stop... stop playing victim on each other.\n For Rust enthusiasts, if you think maintainers who still use C are resisting to give a \"good documentation\", that means they expect you to learn how those C source codes work then write a good Rust code from those. Same as when C devs are tried to learn how to code C based on reverse engineered binaries, or a hardware datasheet if lucky. Nothing is easy, no one want to spoon-feed you except you're a toodler.

          "description": "I've been reading a lot of posts in this sub after the Windows 11's downfall, I truly appreciate those who are recognising the privacy concerns and are trying to make their cyberlife safer.\n With MacOS breaking the limits of how proprietary a proprietary software can be, and Windows being a privacy buster since the release of Win10, there aren't as many options for PC users, except to go for a Linux distro.\n With that in mind, having hundred posts from users trying to move to Linux, asking questions about the most basic necessities to run Linux as a daily driver such as:\n  \nChoice of distro,\n \nChoice of DE,\n \nBest OSS packages for QoL, such as power management for laptops, color adjustment utilities, sound utilities, wireless utilities etc\n \n ...is not optimal. What I think can help will be a community effort to make a one-stop destination for such recommendations. The inspiration for this post came to me after I saw the anime recommendation flowchart in r/anime.\n As a fellow Linux user for the past year, I definitely agree with whoever that says there isn't a one-size-fits-all solution for any of the aforementioned necessities, and the customizability is what gives Linux the advantage. But I also think that it's equally important to bring attention to promising software so that they'll receive more support in the form of issues, feedback and PRs, and it will eventually help improve the Linux experience altogether.\n Ofcourse what I'm implying is a good starter pack, so that the user can slowly try out others as they understand what they feel is lacking in their current software, and give feedback to the software on the way.\n    submitted by    /u/NoCoolSenpai  \n [link]   [comments]",

However, I very seldom hear any people talk about it - very unknown. \n I find it is the closest Analog you can have on Linux (without fidgeting with Bottles/Wine) to something like Clip Studio in feel and workflow; though not features sadly.\n Krita is still decent but, it has it's own quirks so I always struggle to really use it long term. Linearting just does not feel as responsive on equivalent hardware. Fantastic for Painters though - but lacking for comic and Cellshading styles imo; in big part cause of weak selection and fill tools that I heavily use in such - lack of a \"Gap closing\" function being a big pain in the arse. Paintstorm pretty much solves all of that, I can go about just as fast as in Clip without having to do any manual adjustment.\n Only dealbreaker for some might be that Paintstorm is not FOSS - but well worth the cheap price tag to me. Development is not fast but a couple of updates a year is decent enough.\n    submitted by    /u/Feisty-Pay-5361  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hey everyone, \n A while back, I posted my Arch Linux guide covering full disk encryption with LUKS2, LVM2, Secure Boot, and TPM2 unlocking. For those who haven't seen it, the guide is here: Arch Linux install guide.\n Recently, someone pointed out a vulnerability in the setup that could allow an attacker to mimic the root partition using the same UUID to boot a rogue OS, then query the TPM for the decryption key.\n I've updated the guide with instructions on how to secure against this. If you're using TPM unlocking, I highly recommend checking out the update to make sure you're protected.\n Basically, how the protection works is by using systemd-measure to precalculate the hash value that's expected in the PCR 11 of the TPM during a specific boot phase enter-initrd. The boot process has several phases. And during each phase , the PCR11 is extended with the hash of the new phase. \n Now during boot , during the enter-initrd phase, the TPM checks for other values in PCR 0 , 7. It also checks that the value in the PCR11 matches the precalculated value by systemd-measure, and releases the key. After the enter-initrd phase, comes the switch-root phase. This extends the PCR11 again. Now if an attacker tries to query the TPM from the rogue OS, he will fail, because the PCR11 value doesn't match the precalculated value.\n Thanks to everyone who has supported the guide so far! If you find it helpful, a star on GitHub would be greatly appreciated.\n    submitted by    /u/_d3f4alt_  \n [link]   [comments]",

I put up with the issue for now.\n Then I notice HIGH idle ram usage, like 9-10gb at idle, any ram intensive programs are shut down. Between all this and the Windows Recall stuff, I'm done. I download Endeavour OS, backup my files and wipe my windows install. BAM. I'm seeing reasonable ram usage and not only that, my CPU is ACTUALLY MAKING THE BOOST. \n That's it.\n I'm happy.\n    submitted by    /u/DiscoMilk  \n [link]   [comments]",

I am debating which is the best alternative and wondering what other Linux users do in this situation?\n Dual-boot? A hassle having to jump back and forth between the two OS, not to mention having to keep up with Windows updates. I'd rather forget Windows exists as native OS.\n Wine/Proton? As of 2024 it still seems a convoluted process, pollutes your distro with Windows executables and libraries (eww) and of course there are no guarantees the specific app needed will run.\n Local virtual machine? - Not ideal if you are using a laptop on battery often as the performance overhead will drain the battery faster, also it just feels slow and thefore annoying to use.\n Cloud virtual machine? I never tried it before, I wonder what's the performance like, but surely it requires adding a monthly expense.\n RDP into a Windows PC? This is the one I am most inclined to, even though I don't have a separate desktop PC right now, but I tried Parsec to someone else's laptop and it really has low latency streaming if the connection is good, it's quite usable, more so than a virtual machine.\n Any other possibilities I am missing?\n    submitted by    /u/vanwaldi  \n [link]   [comments]",

However, he could not access the screen reader through the installation process which rendered it completely inaccessible to him.\n I did some research and found that Kali has some trouble with the screen reader for the terminal, which people seem to solve by installing and using gnome as default DE. \n I tried to help him remotely, but we haven't had any success. Unfortunately, today I can't videocall him to help with the installation. \n So I came here asking for help: could you reccommend an accessible distro for people who need screen readers?

I was also very surprised by the speed and responsiveness of the OS in general.\n This makes me very tempted to switch to Ubuntu as a daily driver, especially as the list of Windows apps and games that are also being developed for Linux, or that work with popular compatibility layers (Wine, Proton, etc.), is constantly growing. Unfortunately, though, I closely rely on Microsoft's Office suite for work with classmates, and after trying LibreOffice, Wine, and the web version of Office 365, nothing compares to the native Windows app.\n What is Linux missing?\n Why are so many people/organizations still relying on an old and outdated OS like Windows?\n How long will it take for people to realize that Linux is the better choice?\n    submitted by    /u/Firm-Garbage-8188  \n [link]   [comments]",

I use two separate drives, and each have their own EFI.\n Windows does this annoying thing, where it will install its EFI stuff in any EFI partition it finds on any disk, even if it's not the disk you want to install to... but I thought of a neat workaround for this that doesn't require \"unplugging your Linux drive\" sorts of fixes... by instead, basically changing your Linux EFI type to something else temporarily, and then back.\n  \nBoot a live Linux distro (eg. Arch installer)\n Change your Linux EFI partition type from EF00 (EFI) to 8300 (Linux Filesystem) using gdisk (gdisk /dev/<disk> -> t (change partition's type code) -> Partition # (probably 1) -> 8300 -> w (write out))\n Install Windows (It won't find an EFI and will make its own on the same disk you're installing to)\n Boot back into a live Linux distro, and change the code back.\n gdisk /dev/<disk> -> t (change partition's type code) -> Partition # (probably 1) -> EF00 -> w (write out))\n  \nThis was helpful for me, as my drive isn't easily disconnectable (NVME), and my bios didn't seem to offer a way to \"disable\" the drive temporarily.

          "description": "One major issue with Linux distributions is that for each piece of software, there's a package for Debian, Arch, Fedora, Ubuntu, etc. Binaries are usually compiled dynamically linked (as opposed to statically linked), which means the libraries aren't contained in the binaries themselves, rather they're linked to system libraries. Therefore, you can't just run a binary from your Arch system on a Debian-based system. Many people say the solution to this issue is Flatpak, Snaps, and AppImages. These don't really address the real problem though. The actual solution is compiling statically linked binaries. This would also make it easier for developers to make binaries for Linux knowing they can be ran on any distribution.\n    submitted by    /u/SaltyMaybe7887  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hey all! Ever since I first discovered Linux, I've been quite interested in it. I like how linux is private and anonymous, unlike Windows. How it's so customizable to your like and taste. I'm not really a fan of Windows, I gotta admit. But so far, the advantages of Windows over Linux still kinda make me hesitant to really make the switch. Yeah, gaming is very doable now thanks to software advances with programs such as Wine and Steam's Proton. But unfortunately, some games still don't run on Linux, or they do, but not flawless. Especially multiplayer games which use anti-cheat software. Unfortunately some or most of them are apparently borderline malware, with how deep they can be nestled/rooted in the OS once installed. I've got an Nvidia graphics card, and though I found out there are linux drivers for them, I'm not sure how good it is compared to Windows. On my pc I've got Nvidia GeForce experience which neatly notifies me when there's a driver update. If I don't get a notification I just don't update. I don't want to manually check for updates every time I boot up my pc. Also I've already got plenty of stuff installed on my pc, and I'm not exactly thrilled if I have to reinstall all of it, if I switch to Linux. So far Microsoft haven't really done anything that I know of that made me determined to switch to Linux.\n    submitted by    /u/SpaceSloth707  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "hello,\n I keep a diary, a very long text file and Linux is wonderful with its scripting abilities for support of it. For example I have a scripts like \"open the diary on the last page so I can write today's entry\" \"insert a header with current date and day of the week for current entry\" \"insert a fortune cookie message of the day taken from the fortune(6) application\" \"open the diary on a pseudo-random page so I can reflect the past\" (this is better than opening a paper diary on a pseudo-random page because you don't involve whether it will be entry from the beginning of the diary or the end) \n all this is done by combining the command line switches and \":r!\" commands in Vim with custom Perl scripts. I don't know how much it will take to make something like that on WIndows, you will probably have to create your own application in Delphi which is cumbersome. \n tried to post this to r/linuxmasterrace but they don't allow text posts, I guess it is OK here, since it involves Linux and Linux is praised\n    submitted by    /u/danielsoft1  \n [link]   [comments]",

Within this time-frame I used mostly openSUSE Tumbleweed and the latest Fedora.\n Well, the first laptop died within 3 years, and had some weird CPU spikes, and resume from suspend was hit or miss. Also I had to deal with broadcom drivers constantly breaking with kernel updates.\n The second laptop had frequent freezes causing the session to hang and require cold reboots. I tried several solutions and kernel parameters but the issue remained to this day. \n The third laptop, with RX dGPU, constantly flickers when connecting to a external FreeSync 144hz display.\n My most recent purchase was finally a Intel laptop with Xe graphics (LG Gram), and behold, I have none of these issues at all. Wayland, suspend and resume, external displays, battery runtime equal to Windows, all works great. It might be just luck with this particular model but honestly it made me regret my past purchases.\n Since then I have learned more about Intel active and timely contributions to the Linux kernel and I am hoping the layoffs won't cause that to decrease.\n Either Intel has been improving a lot these last few years or AMD has been overhyped, but the hassle free experience with a Intel laptop has made me hesitant with going to AMD+NVIDIA on my next desktop build, I am Seriously considering going with Intel CPU+Arc GPU.\n    submitted by    /u/vanwaldi  \n [link]   [comments]",

I was ten, a daughter of impoverished parents living in a midwestern trailer park, and had been given this crappy old PC by my uncle. The OS was corrupted, he didn't have a license key, and I was about to chuck the thing when someone gave me a set of Mandriva install CDs.\n I remember the process being a tremendous pain in the ass and taking a long time, but I ended up with a working install, and the KDE 3.5 desktop. We did have what passed for high-speed internet access at the time (while living on hot dogs and cheesy mac), so I was able to engage with the community, learn a lot, and work around problems.

Our patented design allows for the camera to be applied directly onto any type of fabric completely accessory-free.\n On the software side, the top action cameras in the market allow you to only stream footage from the device to your app - our app allows to stream the footage from Ucam globally.\n We already have a stellar lineup of investors and advisors, including a former NBA Champion & DPOY, WNBA All-Stars, the CDO of 3Step Sports, one of the Atlanta Dream team owners, and the Executive VP of HoopGroup, to name a few.\n  \nWe're currently seeking a firmware engineer to add to the team.

It was one of the earliest kde 6 adopter and latest kernel is great for how rapidly gaming is growing on Linux. They also do some testing before shipping the updates and it's the default os that ships with their hardware so you can be sure it'll work. Wayland is used by default. Flatpak and nvidia drivers are pre-installed. Snaps are removed (I know they're preferred for servers but majority don't like them on personal computers so this is still a plus).\n What do you guys think about it?\n Edit: They're also KDE patron and organize their events in Tuxedo offices, i think that's pretty nice.\n    submitted by    /u/nikunjuchiha  \n [link]   [comments]",

Linux-based operating systems have existed for decades and have evolved into all possible directions.

          "description": "Hello everyone,\n Just a random thought I had recently. I've been using Linux for awhile now. I switched to linux because of cfd being faster in linux and because of technologies like docker, lxc and chroot. In addition, I had some amazing fun playing with linux on my phone via termux too. I still dual boot windows, but I'm slowly just using linux for most things. So effectively I'm in the windows --> linux camp. I see myself most comfortable with kde and I enjoy themes that compliment that workflow.\n However I've known friends who prefer gnome and use macOS like themes, and not so surprisingly is also from a MacOS --> Linux camp. So this got me thinking, can the choice of someone's preferred DE and theme be a good indication of where they are switching from?\n Please share your thoughts on the matter! Let me know (if you dual boot or fully switched) what OS you used to use before coming to linux and if you have a prefered DE and theme?\n Thanks 🫡\n    submitted by    /u/EternalSeekerX  \n [link]   [comments]",

When I heard all the telemetry news, and when i saw how badly my laptop was taking windows, i had enough. It also helped that I'm a developer and switched to vim/nvim (still not sure which one i like more), and i use git bash all the time. And getting that to run on windows is just a hassle. On linux it's a breeze. Not to mention being fed up with the lack of customization for keybinds and general appearance.\n I spent one day. Backing up all my stuff. And then booted linux mint from a USB. Installed it, fiddled with the drivers/kernels (it still has some graphics/display issues unfortunately :/) and MAN... My Laptop hit record low temps, 50-60° idle, one time i saw even 43°! Everything is so quick to load and work with. Loving the command line way of doing things as well. I love the sense of security and calmness that comes with it all. I just feel at ease again. And i can focus on my work.\n I had to keep windows as dual boot unfortunately because of stuff required by my organizations.

          "description": "I'm pretty new to linux as my daily system and most of my scripting has been used for small work tasks. \n I just installed Pop Os and found the application Komorebi which is used for wallpapers and for my case live wallpapers. I came from windows as my daily driver and used Wallpaper Engine for this and was hoping to find a way to emulate that on my linux machine.\n I didn't want to have to go out and find downloads for videos to turn into wallpapers myself so I build a script that taps into the workshop directory of steam for Wallpaper Engine (installed using proton) and migrates them to Komorebi by making configs and extracting a frame for the thumbnail.\n This allows me to launch the wallpaper engine UI and use it to find wallpapers I want and then migrate them on demand.\n Obviously there will likely be bugs but I'm pretty proud of it.\n I put it up in my public repo and I'm going to continue to improve it where I can. If this is something you're interested in trying here's the link. Included a short video here to show the various wallpapers I pulled into Komorebi from Wallpaper Engine.

          "description": "Hey r/linux,\n Nano is installed on most Linux systems nowadays since it has replaced vi as the default text editor in most distributions for years now. That means most of us are probably using it quite frequently, possibly without even thinking about it when it is called by default (e.g., when using visudo, or when editing a commit message for a git merge operation on a remote host we SSH'd into), but also some of us may be explicitly using it to edit remote config files, editing file as root even locally, or maybe even for programing?\n I actually do use it to program when I'm live coding in front of my students, because I can open it in tmux which allows me to have the same editor on my laptop's screen and on the big display my students see without having to duplicate screen so I can have other notes for myself for example (also, it's good for them to see that it is possible even in 2024 to code using simple tools that runs on your own computer rather that editing files directly on GitHub or wherever…).\n Because of that, I came to realize what an under appreciated gem nano actually is. Recent discussions on HN and here lead me to wonder how to showcase and discuss nano's features, so I thought why not share our .nanorc files?\n I'll copy mine in a comment below :).\n For those of you who never bothered to customize nano, be sure to check the `nanorc` man page, and to not miss its \"REBINDING KEYS\" section which lists the various and sometimes quite advanced editing functions most people ignore that nano has: syntax highlighting, line numbering, auto-indent, multi buffers, mouse support, keyboard macros, …\n So, do you use nano? What for? What does your .nanorc look like if you have one? What is your favorite nano feature? \n    submitted by    /u/p4bl0  \n [link]   [comments]",

So the title is intended as a colloquialism and not so much click bait. In candor, I think this is the tech fad of the month, Linux talk will slow down back to normal and maybe a marginally faster mid term growth. Linux being at 5.2% in 18 months is optimistic, but not unrealistic.\n There is so much pro-Linux and anti-Windows talk in tech communities that aren't even Linux or SOG centric, sure Level1techs made benchmarks, but a lot of other outlets are referencing it. Tom from \"Moore's Law is Dead\" says the Linux Desktop readyness is will be there in 5 to 10 years and we might be there by then and I expect somebody like him to be more skeptical than he was. Tom's Guide (different Tom) installed SteamOS on The ROG Ally X and there was better performance and battery life and DankPods. This is anecdotal, but I follow a variety streamer that I don't think I heard her talk about Linux ever and she tried streaming a Vtuber setup that uses Unreal Engine and heaven knows what and she streamed from the Deck from Proton and it was very choppy and I said \"I think DXVK is compiling shaders and the more you do those effects, the bigger shader cache you'll get and it will stop chopping\". The stream eventually crashed, but considering it's a handheld and it's going through all that translation, I'm surprised it ran that well even though it crashed. She plans on not doing that on the deck until AMD/Valve makes a encoder Driver for Windows.\n    submitted by    /u/commodore512  \n [link]   [comments]",

This is found under Settings > Accessibility > Color and motion > Color correction. \n \nExternal display settings - a feature I spotted last month - is now live in Android 15 QPR1 Beta 2! When you hook your Pixel 8 or Pixel 9 series device up to an external monitor, you'll be able to change its display resolution or rotation under Settings > Connected devices. \n \nGoogle has announced that Android 15 QPR1 Beta 2 enables desktop windowing support on tablets like the Pixel Tablet. \n \nAndroid 15 QPR1 Beta 2 enables the lock screen widgets feature on the Pixel Tablet. More details can be found in my article on Android Authority. \n \nAndroid 15 QPR1 Beta 2 now lets you customize the look of the mouse pointer, so you can make it easier to see.\n \n What's in development for later\n  \nThe notification cooldown feature that used to be in the Android 15 preview - the one that stops notification spam - might be coming back in Android 15 QPR1. Here's a first look at its updated page in Settings. \n \nGoodbye Extra Dim, hello Even Dimmer! In Android 15 QPR1 Beta 2, Google is preparing to integrate Android's Extra Dim feature into the system brightness bar, so you don't have to remember to turn it off in the morning anymore.\n \n    submitted by    /u/MishaalRahman  \n [link]   [comments]",

I had my phone rooted for a long time because I like more control over my phone. Google has been slowly eroding that and now I can't even use RCS anymore because my bootloader is unlocked. The only 2 things keeping me here are notifications and firefox.\n Anyways, to elaborate on the headline instead of ranting: Tensor is not great for anyone who wants to do anything with videos. It takes so long to cut the length of a video. And when I was blocking out the kid face it took so long to save that video.\n https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8T7w7mzNqI8 here is a video showing how long it took to shorten \n https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8T7w7mzNqI8 here is how long it took to save.\n It is just really frustrating as when I want to send videos to my family it takes so long to shorten the extraneous parts. iPhones and even qualcomm chips are sooo much faster and I don't know I can in good faith upgrade to a $1,000 phone when performance on an every day task is so terrible.\n    submitted by    /u/rustid  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hello everyone,\n I’ve spent the last two weeks testing my new Chipolo One Point tracker with Google’s new Find My Device feature. I placed the tracker in my car, which was parked in a long-term parking lot at the airport. I was eager to see how often the tracker would be detected. I reported the tracker as missing in Find My Device and waited for a notification that it had been located. Well, I waited the full two weeks, and the tracker was only detected when I was back at my car. \n It was only after this that I researched why the tracker hadn’t been detected even once. It turns out that in the Google settings, the owner of each individual phone must manually enable the option to find trackers and other Find My Device devices. By default, trackers are only found in highly frequented areas, where multiple devices detect the tracker simultaneously.\n The parking lot where my car was parked is visited by a relatively large number of people—most of the parking spaces were booked. Yet, my tracker was not detected even once.\n I wish I had placed an AirTag for comparison. I’m sure the AirTag would have been detected at least once, if not several times.\n I really thought the new Chipolo trackers would be a viable alternative to Apple AirTags.\n Unfortunately, Android trackers are useless to me in this regard.\n    submitted by    /u/Komplexkonjugiert  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "我目前就读于一所双非一本大学今年刚刚大四，是复读一年考上的，第一年连二本都上不了，第二年高了一本线 19 分。当时很高兴，整个暑假都在憧憬着美好的大学生活，感觉自己将来会大有作为......\n软件工程这个专业是我自己选的，因为那时我觉得我对计算机还算感兴趣，也有很多想法，喜欢捣鼓，上大学的第一台台式主机也是我自己买配件组装的。\n但是回想到现在，我好像一直都在迷茫中，真的不确定自己喜欢什么、想要什么。\n高中的时候就学过一点点 c 语言参加过算法竞赛，之前还因为玩 mc 开过服务器，学 java 还想开发插件 mod 啥的，买过域名、买过云服务器、搭过博客、还搞域名邮箱啥的，在服务器上跑 python 脚本刷校园跑...22 年周围人还不知道 ChatGPT 的时候我就已经深度体验过了。当时还想说开发一个代理网站，token 收费那种。也炒过币玩了合约(当时啥相关知识也没有，亏了钱)想过去了解这方面的知识......等等的这一切，我都只是表面折腾了下，后面就没有坚持下去了，在大学很多时间我是在玩游戏、睡懒觉、刷短视频、应付学校的作业。我觉得我是很有想法的，但是没有激情、没有执行力，或者叫间歇性努力。\n目前在准备秋招，陆陆续续也面了几家了，都是因为八股或者业务不熟挂了。我是一开始就不打算考研的，大一开始就参加了 acm 但是后面没什么结果，只有一些小奖蓝桥杯国二啥的，之后也是一直在应付学校的课程，当时那会自己也不知道要走哪个方向，后面大三才慢慢确定要走 Java 后端，才开始学习，之后今年 5 月份在本地找了一个小实习，也没干啥就是 crud 。\n对于就业这方面，我也是因为不想考研，加上 java 就业机会多才选择的。\n现在每天都是躲在寝室，偶尔投投简历、看看八股文、刷刷算法题目，参加宣讲会、面试。\n大部分时间都是在睡觉、刷手机、玩游戏。\n晚上睡不着、很晚睡、早上起不来，醒来第一件事是点一份“国潮”外卖，坐在床上刷着抖音等着外卖......\n感觉自己已经废掉了。\n我也尝试过改变出去走走、骑骑自行车啥的，但是感觉也就那样。\n我觉得我自己应该会喜欢旅游，但是我没有说走就走的勇气，因为我总是会在心里告诉自己，等什么时候有时间了、等毕业了、等找到工作了、等赚到钱了......所以直到现在我也没有自己真正出去旅游过。\n在学校也没啥朋友，我本人倒不是非常内向，只是说没有那种真心的朋友，除非像室友一样天天在一起，我基本上很少和别人交流，也不会去主动找一些志趣相投的，而且我不太会聊天，和不太熟的人也不知道说什么。\n说到室友，那会我还没上大学的时候，还在幻想，室友和我都是一群对计算机感兴趣的人，大家天天一起研究各自好玩的，甚至最终大家一起创业......结果还是我自己想多了，原来他们选择软件工程这个专业，只是因为听说赚钱，都对这方面不太感兴趣，从大一到现在，也没见过他们主动去研究过什么，更别说主动写代码。最后也都是打算干其他的。\n感觉说太多了。如果你能看到这里，非常感谢你的时间。\n我的家里经济情况也是比较普通，没有穷困潦倒，也没有大富大贵，上大学后，自己就一直感觉被束缚住了，就是想快点独立，不需要用家里的钱，所以现在也想快点找个工作，但是又想找个好点的，奈何自己实力不允许，找到现在也是 0offer 。\n我不知道是不是自己上大学后太懒了，反正现在就是非常迷茫，做什么都坚持不下去，没有动力，也不知道接下来的路怎么走......",

          "description": "一周前在 Apple 官网下单了标准玻璃+支持倾斜度调节的款式，11499 元，上手后发现有明显的电流噪声和风扇噪声，尝试各类方法无果，前两天申请了退货，今天顺丰小哥把东西取走了。还是来说说个人的上手体验吧，顺便一提，自己的设备是 Mac mini ，此前搭配使用的是 BenQ PD2706U：\n显示效果非常细腻震撼，并且由于分辨率的提升，显示内容比 BenQ 大了一整圈。\n唤醒速度快，1s 左右，相比之下 BenQ 需要 5s 唤醒。\n麦克风音质不错。\nSDR 亮度可达 600nit ，亮度适当调高一些，观感真的不一样，而 BenQ 只有 350nit ，很多时候觉得是不够的。\n机身做工拉满，全铝合金外壳+底座，倾斜度调节非常顺滑。\n抗反光涂层效果出色，只要不是在黑色背景下，几乎察觉不到反光，同时不失镜面屏的通透观感，再回头看 BenQ 会有一种雾蒙蒙的感觉。\n弹幕滚动比较丝滑，没有明显拖影，而 BenQ 有明显的顿挫感。\n漏光控制一般。\n摄像头画质一般。\n不支持 HDR ，但藉由 macOS 的色彩管理系统还是可以播放 HDR 内容的，但 600nit 的亮度只能说是能看。\n音响听着比较闷，但基本素质是有的，没有明显的偏音问题。\n边框较宽，一定程度上影响观感。\n随机出现明显的电流噪声和风扇噪声，这个缺点把前面所说的优点全部盖过了，严重影响日常使用。入手之前我已经了解到可能会有这个问题，但是抱着试试看的心态还是入手了一台，没想到还是不行。搜了下 B 站，有说是电源线屏蔽没做好导致的，有说是用电质量导致的，总之我更新固件、加屏蔽磁环、换滤波插排都试过了，没一个奏效的，遂弃疗。\n总结：如果没有噪声问题，必然是不会退货的，但既然中奖也没有办法，我也懒得换货了，毕竟换货还是一样的问题可就尴尬了，而且到时候也没法退货了。排除掉这点，综合来看 SD 无疑是 Mac 能搭配使用的最佳显示器，它不像 Pro Display XDR 那样价格高昂、体积庞大，同时又集成了摄像头、麦克风和音响，很多情况下确实能省不少事，再搭配出色的 P3 广色域和系统内置的调节功能，方方面面都走在竞品前列，当然价格也走在前列就是了。",

          "description": "2024 ，0909-0915\n这个周记的标题一改再改，因为被拒的次数不断增加。\nGoogle Play 账户验证\n这周一次性通过了 Google Play 的身份验证和银行账户验证。\n之前听闻有的开发者卡在这里好久，提交各种资料就是不能通过。我也害怕这种事发生在我身上，好在没有。就是按照要求提交了身份证、水电费和银行流水，就直接通过验证了。\n\n虽然来自 GP 的收入一直在下降，但是也是目前收入的重要组成的一部分，占到美元收入的差不多四成左右。\n上周有人留言要买我的账号的 App ，向群友请教了一番，结果并不能卖多少钱，连一两特斯拉 Model Y 都不够。算了，还是别杀鸡取卵了。\nShipaton 第五周\n距离截止日期还剩 3 天。\n第五周生产力大爆发，一共完成了 56 个番茄钟，是最多的一周！\n\n因为马上就要到 deadline 了，为了能够顺利提交 App ，不得不又砍掉了一个 Jar Type 。剩余的工作就是 UI 调整，修复 bug ，加入动画和声效以提高交互性。设计师列了几十个 UI 调整事项，还好我很快就完成了大部分，一天发四五个 TestFlight 的 build ，只剩几项我认为比较费时就先搁置了。\nhttps://youtu.be/F12HzTVRrT0\n连续被拒 6 次\n终于，周五下午四点提交了第一版，没想到过了 30 个小时才进入审核。整个周六的精神状态都是心不在焉的，什么都干不进去，总在期待收到审核结果的邮件，然后意料之中地被拒了。第一次被拒的原因还好，只是元数据的问题，填补后顺便修复了一个小组件的问题第二次提交（周六晚上）。\n在等待审核的间隙，完善了 Ship-A-Ton 的各种资料，还第一次用 Rotato 录了一个演示视频。\nhttps://youtu.be/IRKSo2Txclc\n然而，第二次被拒就是周日下午了，直到午夜连着拒绝了五次……\n\n第二次被拒的原因：Paywall 页面里缺少付费后用户得到的功能或服务（我选择的这个 Revenue Cat Paywall 模板没有关于付费解锁内容的配置）。\n第三次和第四次被拒都是同样的原因：说是 Paywall 页面无法加载，影响用户付费体验。但我这个 Paywall 是 RevenueCat 提供的，加载过程不由我控制，RC 的建议就是如果一切配置没问题的话，那就是苹果审核环境导致的，没有其他办法，只能是一遍遍的重复提交。\n第五次被拒的原因：页面存在难以阅读的文字。其实就是 Onboarding 部分的大段文字颜色有些浅，而且在小屏幕的手机上会显示不全。\n第六次被拒的原因有三个：\n付费页面的按钮文案不符合要求，而我这还是借鉴了 Mobbin 发布的关于提高付费转化率的最佳实践。\n付费后遇到错误，我猜是因为 App 销售范围和订阅的销售范围不一致导致的，因为我还没有时间备案，所以第一版就不打算在国内上架了。虽然 App 销售范围去掉了中国大陆，但是订阅的销售范围还是所有国家和地区，这里不一致，另外我也回复给审核人员说这个 App 不在中国大陆销售，请用其他国家的配置环境来审核。\n技术支持 URL 留的网址不符合要求，我本以为用 Notion 搭一个包含隐私政策和使用协议的简单页面就可以了，但是苹果说必须要是能和开发者直接联系的网站才行。\n第七次提交后就马上是午夜十二点了，心情已经麻木和崩溃了，十分沮丧和忐忑地入睡了。我还梦见了第七次被拒，审核员还给我发了一封巨长巨长的邮件，里面罗列了各种素材和命名的截图，说我的 App 抄袭黑神话·悟空……\n还好，没有第七次被拒，一觉醒来，审核通过了！\n我偏要贪图完满，搜个干净\n黑神话·悟空，二周目，白金达成。\n这游戏白金的达成，不是能力问题，也不是时间问题，而是运气问题。\n花了两天在收集各种概率掉落的物品上，感觉我人品还不错，并没有刷到崩溃就收集全了，不过就凭这一点也应该给这个游戏减 0.1 分。",

          "description": "今天下午，一朋友在某群 at 我，神秘兮兮的说道要考我一个问题。题目是这样的：\n在 Java 中有 Father 和 Son 类，其中 Son 继承了 Father 类，两类均有 method 方法，现在 Main 类的 main 方法有如下调用：\nFather f = new Son();\nf.method();\n\n问题是，编译此代码，完成后删除 Son.class，请问代码会报错吗？\n我嗤之以鼻，这还用问吗？我甚至可以告诉你这个代码会报的错一定是 NoClassDefFoundError，这也太简单了你拿这个来考我 balabala...\n然而朋友鬼魅一笑（？），你别急啊，题还没出完呢：\n在上述代码的基础上，加入一个 flag justFalse，并环绕到上述代码中：\n// in Main.java\nstatic boolean justFalse = false;\n\n// in Main#main method\nif (justFalse) {\n\tFather f = new Son();\n\tf.method();\n}\n\n同样编译后删除 Son.class，请问代码还还会报错吗？\n我大笑（？）道，这还用问？justFalse 永远是 false，也就是说内部代码永远不可能执行到，那么 Son 类也就永远不可能进入初始化阶段，所以这个代码肯定就不会报错了，这也太简单了你拿这个来考我 balabala...\n然后朋友发来的一张图让我沉默了：\n\n竟然真的会报错，难道 JVM 虚拟机会提前解析并未执行的代码行中包含的类引用吗？不对啊，这和我以前的实践完全不一样，怎么会这样...... 就在我陷入自我怀疑的时候，下一题来了：\n在上述代码的基础上，如果把 Father f = new Son(); 修改为 Son f = new Son();，在同样的操作下，请问代码还还会报错吗？\n我小心翼翼地问道：不会这样它就不会报错了吧...\n朋友淡淡说道：正是。\n我的脑海中此时一万匹草泥马奔驰而过，各种名词在我的大脑中穿过：类加载、静态分派、运行时多态、分支预测... 但没有一个能解释这个诡异的现象。\n我的天塌了。 \n深入了解 JVM 类加载机制\n当说到 JVM 的类加载机制，很多人可能会脱口而出：加载、验证、准备、解析、初始化。如果你接着问他，他可能还会告诉你，解析这个阶段在某些情况下可以在初始化阶段之后开始，这被 JVM 虚拟机称为“惰性解析（\"lazy\" or \"late\" resolution ）”。那么，出现上述情况的原因可能是因为惰性解析被提前了吗？\n然而答案是否定的，在任何情况下，对于一个类，无论其静态分派的类型是什么，其解析都会延迟进行。（即使在 JVM specs 中这种行为是未定义的，虚拟机实现可以选择立刻解析或是延迟解析）\n那么问题出在哪里了呢？经过一番查证，我发现这个报错其实是在 JVM 类加载的验证阶段产生的。\n注意，这里说的不是验证 Son.class 或是 Father.class，而是 Main.class。如果你仔细观察上面给出的堆栈轨迹（在 Oracle JDK 1.8, Hotspot VM 下），其中有一段就是 sun.launcher.LauncherHelper.checkAndLoadMain(LauncherHelper.java:632)。\n在类加载阶段，JVM 虚拟机会试图校验一个类的某些部分是否是未被破坏以及符合预期的。在对 Main.class 类的加载过程中，对于 Father f = new Son(); 和 f.method();，产生了一个包含向上类型转换的多态函数调用，对于这种调用，JVM 虚拟机会试图进行校验，这就需要加载 Son.class 的类结构，而 Son.class 已经被我们删除了，所以产生了报错。\n这种检查需要同时包含 typecast 以及多态函数调用，在上述代码中，无论将变量类型修改为变量的实际类型 Son，亦或者删去对 method 方法的调用，那么也不会产生报错。\n最后，如何验证上述推断是正确的呢？很简单，使用 -noverify 参数关闭 JVM 的类加载校验，你就可以发现上述代码正常运行了。\n（上述代码在 Java 1.8 和 Java 21 的 Hotspot 虚拟机上均能复现。为方便行文，对部分内容有所改编。）",

          "description": "事情起因是这样的。前天的一个帖子里（ https://www.v2ex.com/t/1070885?p=1#reply35 ）大家都表示 AI 对自己的工作无用。我只是有点好奇，为什么我的感觉完全相反？所以想分享一下我的感觉和情况，很好奇大家感觉的没用是什么意义上的没有用（因为不了解专业程序员的工作流程）。\n本人没学过大多数码，但是算法懂。因为工作和研究兴趣需要（ NLP ，很多很冷门的语言），也会经常坐一些很没办法要做的东西。比如分词器，就和 Andrej Karpathy 的网课跟着做，所以其实前一段时间看见他推荐 cursor ，我前天开始也就试着用。然后就觉得 AI 太有用了。我暂时感觉突然摆脱了对程序员的大多数依赖。\n比如，试验阶段就很快用 prompts 做了一个全栈的、机构内部使用的工作记录论坛，感觉很兴奋。因为我之前既不会 java 、也没学过 sql 。就看着看着，debug 的时候，感觉就大概了解了构架、前端后端怎么互动的 blabla ，觉得很不错。我打算马上用现有的经验，写一个网页版的数据库，可以搜集结构化的语料 metadata （就是研究生会看古代语言的、就用这个网页进行标记并且生成结构化的元数据的 database 了，以后 training 时候用）（这样他们做习题就是 labelling slaves 了哈哈）。在之前这是想都不敢想的，肯定会想外包。但即便让专业 coder 做，也会有太多太多需要交流的小细节，比如很多语言是从右到左、从上到下，元音啊各种细节包不包括，乱七八糟的细节，这些调整交流起来会吐血（尤其是 coder 如果完全是技术部门来的），和 cursor 交流就感觉非常好，真的可以一个人把这个想了很久的事情做成。\n再举一个例子，我之前也想过用 OpenAI 的 api 去导出一些专业的语料元数据，但是有一定的格式需求。我大概知道 function calling 和新的 Response format 可以实现，但是因为自己不是专业的，手笨不会做。但程序员一般都只会英语或者欧洲语言，对这些元语料的结构理解需要很多解释（因为现代语言一般语法都很简单），这是去年就一直搁置到现在。昨天突然想起来，半个小时之内就开始用 function calling 自动帮我生成 training data 了。今天打算晚点试试 response format 效果会不会更好。\n所以我会感觉 ai 真厉害，尤其是很多事情可以一个人做了，会比团队快很多。可能有人觉得 AI 不会 debug ，其实不是这样的。第一，这几天 cursor+claudedev 几乎可以解决过程中 60%的错误。即便不能解决，很快要求它们解释哪部分代码是负责的，看懂之后很容易也能修好剩下的问题。（可能对程序员来说，没学过 java 看 java 的代码是荒谬的。但是实际情况是，其实 java 和 python 里也充满了自然语言，大多数问题理解了出在哪里就很容易看见并且修改。一些更高级的概念，比如类的继承啥的，单独看半个小时也基本理解了，虽然具体语句记不住但是可以问 ai 写。更复杂的 transformer 啥的框架确实要另外学懂才会改造，这个 ai 不行。还有， 剩下 40%的几率 ai 即便不能完全 debug 、但可以快速定位是哪些代码，定位速度可能比有经验的眼睛还快）\n是不是专业程序员写的程序都比这些任务要复杂很多，所以 ai 会失效？还是什么别的原因会觉得 ai 鸡肋呢？真心好奇，避争论。",

          "description": "前言\n好久没有更新了，最近比较忙，平时使用也积累了一些需求和遇到了一些 bug 。主要分布于新功能的构思与旧功能重构，最近遇到了一个棘手问题，不修改就满足不了使用，所以对部分功能进行重构和修改，决定更新一版，满足后续使用\n更新内容\n支持用户自定义目标路径，且支持本机保存可以跨项目使用\n支持安装到所有用户（解决管理员下安装非管理员下运行问题）\n修复了虚拟化问题导致文件列表展示不正确\n修复保存校验个别字段不准确\n修复工作目录和源目录拷贝文件错误\n补充黑色主题部分颜色值\n修复切换语言时导致主题列表显示错误\n功能说明\n支持用户自定义目标路径，且支持本机保存可以跨项目使用\n在日常使用中常常遇到一个问题，比如我要将 A 文件写到 B 目录去，但是 B 目录又不在系统默认的目录列表内，这样就会有一个很尴尬问题，需要手动去改程序增加目录。最近给外国佬做一个程序，他们严格规定目录的写入位置，然后我在打包的时候就发现无法做到这点，新增了自定义目标目录的功能。\n目标路径库 1. 这个是软件提供的目标路径管理的一个功能，可以提供目标路径检索删除新增等功能。打开方式：数据->路径管理 注意：当在项目页面打开时，默认编辑为项目的目标路径库，此时添加可以选择同步到本地，这样所有项目都可以使用，如果在首页进行添加操作则是存储到本地。\n在程序集页面和多语言界面可以选择我们自定义路径支持用户选择自定义文件夹，就可以将指定文 件释放到指定文件夹下。\n\n支持安装到所有用户\n现阶段安装用于管理员身份安装，这样对于国内用户没有问题，但是由于国外用户有的有完整的权限校验，比如管理员下安装，各自用户下使用，导致程序无法找到，现在可以支持一键设置安装到所有用户。\n\n修复了虚拟化问题导致文件列表展示不正确\n修复了一个文件列表虚拟化 策略，导致修改后未保存的话，滚动到可视区域外会失效，需要重新设置的 bug 。（现在存在一个多选的问题，但是不影响使用就是体验稍差点）\n修复工作目录和源目录拷贝文件错误\n修复当工作目录和源目录一致的时候，选择文件出现拷贝无权限操作，导致程序异常。\n修复切换语言时导致主题列表显示错误&补充黑色主题部分颜色值\n修复切换语言时，导致主题列表刷新不及时，无法切换语言列表。并补充了部分主题颜色值\n一点小感悟\n最近工作比较忙，各种乱七八糟的事儿，也是用到哪就更新到哪，遇到问题就去解决。怕自己闲下来，又怕自己停下来没饭吃。人入中年，好多事情和时间都不是自己的了，不过我会努力更新完善的让它更易用，让它帮助到更多的人。\ngithub:https://github.com/tangmanger/PackageEasy\nrelease:https://github.com/tangmanger/PackageEasy/releases",

          "description": "本文作者没有一步登天，也没有怀揣 200 个 w ，更不会装 b ，请放心阅读。\n昨天躺在床上玩手机，突然一想，是不是已经来上海 8 年了？\n2017 年 7 月份的那个夜晚，我从苏州的泰南苑出发，当时的行李很简单，就一个书包和行李箱，坐着和谐号列车，深夜到的上海。\n这个箱子还是我刚上大学那会买的，很重，但很大，我有点担心它挡住过道上别人来来往往，就想把它抗到头顶的行李架上，但是试了好几次都失败了，太重了，每次抗到腰这个位置就被迫放下了。旁边坐着的人肯定都觉得我很奇怪吧，他也太自不量力了，是不是农村来的土狗？\n我不是第一次来上海，以前上大学时，每次都要来上海中转，一般都是晚上的车，所以下午我都会找个地方逛一下，一个人在这个城市里走一走。每次闲逛时，总会被上海的摩天大楼震撼到，这里的路怎么这么宽敞啊，这里的大楼怎么会这么高啊，马上就会有一种自卑感，有一种渺小的感觉。这种感觉留在我的心里很久很久，以至于工作后很久我都不敢来上海，觉得自己太菜了，不配来上海。\n真正让我动心来上海的是，有个同学在上海工作很轻松，都是做程序员，他朝九晚五的，不用加班，我每天还要加班到 9 点多，关键工资是我的两倍多，这让我瞬间有些不服气了，大家水平都差不多，凭什么待遇差这么多啊？\n刚来上海的时候，其实挺不顺利的，不仅是工作，还有生活。\n我记得第一次租房子就租到了群租房，是一个客厅改装成的小房间，当时心里还美滋滋，1500 ，在上海一个高档的小区租到了房子，还挺能耐。同时也是自己第一次在外面租房，感觉还挺自由，再也没有人管我了，想几点睡就几点睡，同时对于我这种 i 人，也不用跟别人社交了，回家就算在家里静静发呆也挺好。\n可是好景不长，一天早上，一阵急促的敲门声把我吵醒，打开门，一群叔叔带着一群农民工直接走进来。还没等我开口问叔叔什么事，那群拿着大锤子的工人直接把锤子抡向木板隔成的墙，大锤 80,80,80 ，那临时拼凑成的木板墙怎么会经受的住这种猛烈的撞击，三两下就都倒塌了，倒向了我的房间，我的床，我的房间就裸露在外了，他们砸完什么都没说，就走了，临走前还把电给断了。\n这个社会不会直接跟你说这个是对的，那个不能做，只是在你做了一件事情后，给你后果，不管是好的后果，还是坏的后果，推着你继续往前走。\n现在大家都说行情不太好，前几年是互联网的黄金时代，随便一个人，包装一下简历就能找到好几个 w 月薪的工作，看到很多短视频还在说，2018 年是最好的一年，值得怀念，可是对于我来说，2018 年真的没有想象中那么好，2018 年我工资就只有几 k,天天还各种加班，被老板 pua,怀疑是自己的问题，严重的拖了大家的后腿。\n有种说法是苦难才能成就今天的自己，我并不这么想，我觉得苦难就是人生的一道坎，不管你是积极面对，还是悲观面对，它都是在那里阻拦着你，如果有的选，没人愿意主动去吃苦。\n没有耀眼的学历，没有显赫的背景，在大城市里单打独斗，随着时间的流走，身上吃饭的技能总会比当初更加成熟，比当初的自己更厉害了，但是个人的成长永远都赶不上时代的潮流的。我已经忘记了当初选择来上海的豪言壮语，但我想肯定不是说为了找一份糊口的工作吧。\n一个资质平庸，能力平庸的人在深夜胡言乱语。",

          "description": "房子卖掉了，亏了小几万，可以接受，就当买个教训。\n以后都不敢把希望寄托在邻居的素质上了。当然还有新房的质量上了。\n把从买到卖，盘点一下，才发现一路走来，真的一步一坑。\n一 买房\n当时还是限购， 需要摇号。\n我家就一个人有资格，\n摇中后， 两个选择：\n1 付定金 2w 。  2 放弃购买，半年内无资格参与摇号\n当时只有样板间，也没什么好参考的，\n所以除非有特别原因 等同于只能选 1 。\n然后约付首付，又是两个选择\n1 付首付。2 放弃 损失定金。\n所以等同于还是只有一个选择。\n我印象里付完首付，才签的合同，记不太清了。\n当时宣传的是房子当年年底就可以交房，我们也是被这个吸引的。\n实际签合同时，在未有任何通知的情况下，合同上的交房时间比宣传的延期了 7 个月。\n这时候同样两个选择，1 签合同，2 扯皮，大概率亏钱。\n毕竟定金，首付都交了，贼船已经上了。\n所以实际上，等同于还是只有一个选择。\n然后交房时间比合同上的还要延期，实际晚了一年半。\n哦 对了 当时还新实行了一个政策，大意就是不卖毛坯了，卖精装修，合同上装修价格是每平米两千多。\n也是没法反对的。\n还能咋样呢，继续签字呗。\n二 收房\n当时花了两百多，请了个验房师。\n人家倒也算敬业，大大小小便利贴，贴了一屋子。\n什么空鼓，裂缝，锁装反了，比比皆是。\n最搞笑的是，燃气热水器孤零零的挂在那，居然接不到燃气管。\n然后呢 报备到开发商，\n偶尔才有下文。\n有些改了，大部分不了了之。\n同样，业主一点办法都没有。\n看似有选择，实则无选择。\n不收房，房子也是你的，问题也还是存在的，我有邻居三年没收房，里面的门还是没装的。\n只能先住着吧。\n三 住房\n三个字，质量差。\n今天这里坏，明天那里坏。\n电梯不到一年，就频繁的关人，或者维修。\n洗脸池，睡前还好好的，起床发现洗脸池掉地上了。\n有个业主很委屈的在群里说，“你们啥时候来给我修灯啊，我都摸黑半年了”。\n最大的槽点是隔音，极其的差。\n楼上，楼上的楼上，楼下的走路说话唱歌，我都可以听到。\n我的房子里就像恐怖片一样，明明就我一个人，能听到一大家子的声音，\n身临其境。\n有走路的，有放东西的，有大喊的，有跑步的，有关门的，\n此起彼伏，热闹非凡。\n偏偏我楼上素质极差，十岁大的小孩，三年学不会穿拖鞋，大人放任不管。大人七点吵架，摔东西。\n沟通过，讲道理过，吵架过，反击过，甚至想过同归于尽，\n不胜其烦。\n当时还是限售，想卖都卖不掉，我是生生的被折磨了几年。\n最后限售过了，很多原因叠加，决定卖了。\n四 卖房\n现在卖房的情况是，不管你装修，不管你户型，不管你楼层，不管你的任何附加价值，只看小区的近期成交价。\n这肯定是不合理的，\n因为就算你去买猪肉，还得分前腿和五花，不同部位的价格肯定不同。\n所以个人感觉这种情况不会持续太久。\n中介，很不专业，房屋信息都能讲错，只会不停的劝你降价。\n（我的房子挂的价格是很公道的，贝壳评分也很高，并没有挂高价）\n甚至出现过疑似虚假带看的行为。\n有一个很假的客户，他走后我就知道，第二天中介肯定要来报价，果然报价了。\n签约，合同是统一的模板，但感觉对卖方的保障不够到位，\n比如如果因为买家问题，导致贷款批不下来，最后终止合同，默认选项是定金返还。\n这就不合理，要不然要定金干嘛呢。\n如果有卖房的朋友，可以关注下这里。\n卖房流程还有一个坑点，首先每个地方的流程和政策是不一样的，可能我说的，其他地方是不存在的。\n买家拿到新房产证后，需要去抵押，然后银行放款。\n这里的坑点就是，如果买家不去抵押，选择了取消贷款，房子已经过户了，你尾款收不到。\n我不知道其他的地方是怎么保障这一块的。\n我去问过银行，他们说，买家是可以取消贷款的，银行不能阻止，也不会通知卖家。\n我也网上查过，有地方是发生过这种 zha 骗的。\n如果买家确实要买，那就没问题，如果别有用心，就很难说。\n所以我当时还是焦虑了两天，还好收到钱了。\n综上，这就是我从买到卖的经历。\n如果踩几个坑，那也许是我运气不好。\n如果每一步都踩了坑，我想不会全是因为我衰。\n反正经历了这一切，我是不太想买房子了，至少不买新房。\n唉 其实房子卖了，还是有点舍不得的，折磨了我这么久，但我也投入了这么多精力和感情。\n现在无车无房无债，有存款。\n希望开始新的生活。",

          "description": "我家里有一台旧笔记本改装的 NAS （黑裙辉），内网穿透的方案是自己买域名+Cloudflare DNS 解析+DDNS 。\n目前托管了多个容器（基于 Docker ），有 Emby 、Komga 、DDNS 等等，当然也包含最基础的文件访问功能。\n目前是基于 HTTP ，因为 Docker 容器貌似无法 HTTPS 连接（可能是我自己不会弄）。\n每一个容器访问都需要单独的密码（只有我自己可以访问），公网只开放了若干个虚拟端口（路由器转发）关闭 SSL 远程访问功能。\n这套方案已经运行了一年多了，一直很稳定。应该是由于我最近得了焦虑症的原因，我突然对此感到很焦虑。\n原因是我当初选择内网穿透的原因就是方便我在学校连接 NAS 看电影（也可以远程控制 NAS 通过磁力下载电影）。虽然使用包括 Emby 在内的所有容器都需要密码，只有我自己可以访问。但是我还是担心版权问题（害怕收律师函）。\n还有一点要提及的，因为我们家用的旁路由代理，因此 NAS 所有的流量都会经过旁路由进行分流，例如磁力相关会直链，不排除漏网之鱼，Emby 的海报源因为来自于 imdb 所以是走代理。基本上除了特别设置（例如磁力源），都是根据解析网站 IP 或者网址本身来分流的，中国大陆的 IP/网站是直连，日本的 IP/网站走日本节点，台北的 IP/网站走台北节点，小众地区统一走日本节点。\n不知道我的担心是不是有点多余了，想听听看各位大佬，尤其是跟我一样家用 NAS 内网穿透的大佬发表一下自己的看法。\n欢迎友好讨论，请不要阴阳怪气谢谢。因为我目前焦虑症的原因，是真的有可能会因为这些阴阳怪气的言论而感到内耗的。还请大家多包涵，我在这里先谢谢大家了。",

          "description": "立秋了，但还是很热。\n镇上创文明树新风，\n取缔无证小商小贩，\n整治商户门前用地。\n像阿志这种站街揽客卖服务的，\n都被无限期勒令停业。\n阿志没了事做。\n***\n午后，\n在阿宝超市门口，\n树下的长椅上，\n阿志躺了。\n太阳很大，\n但树荫下并不太热。\n微风偶而吹过，\n温温的，很舒服。\n迷迷糊糊中，\n阿志似乎听到了咔嚓声，\n母亲切开冰镇大西瓜，\n自己在小桌前，\n期待着。\n***\n“别翻了！冰糕全都让你给翻坏了！”\n是阿宝的声音。\n阿宝老婆一般不让他来看店，\n因为他老得罪人。\n有一次，\n一个老太太讨价还价，来回了几句，\n阿宝一把夺过老太太手里的东西，\n把人给轰了出去。\n现在阿宝关上了冰柜拉门，\n要赶走面前的大爷。\n大爷稀疏的头发和着汗水粘在头皮上，\n抬头看着阿宝，张开的嘴微颤着，\n说不出话来。\n这时，阿宝老婆回来了。\n“来了何大爷！\n棒棒冰换位置了，\n在里面这个冰柜呢。”\n说着拿出一个棒棒冰递给何大爷，\n何大爷接过，放下几个硬币，\n转身朝树下走来。\n***\n阿志看何大爷来了，\n连忙坐起让出位置。\n“日子没法过了啊！”\n何大爷坐下，叹了一口气，\n把棒棒冰一掰两节，\n递给阿志一半：\n“太凉了，我一个人吃不完。”\n阿志没说话，接了过来。\n“日子真是没法过了啊！”\n何大爷又说了一遍。\n“是啊～”\n阿志应了一句。\n何大爷就接受了邀请，开始了倾诉。\n***\n年初，何大爷死了老婆。\n“活着的时候，总吵架，\n这死了，连吵架的人都没有了。”\n“跟你吵架，都是因为在乎你，\n不在乎的，都不会搭理你。”\n“女儿没用，早晚都要嫁出去，\n不嫁出去也没时间应付我这老头子。”\n“人老了，就招人嫌。”\n“她要是嫁出去，我也就不再操心了。”\n“都三十好几了，还能嫁出去吗？”\n何老头停下来，看着阿志。\n阿志低头，\n嗦着棒棒冰，思考着，\n不知道这是个疑问句还是反问句。\n何老头没等到阿志回答，\n继续唠叨了下去。\n棒棒冰吃完了，\n何老头在裤子上抹了抹手，说：\n“要不……你给我推个头吧？”\n***\n吃人嘴软，阿志就答应了。\n外边不让摆摊，\n何老头就说去他家推，\n推完刚好方便洗一下。\n推完，\n何老头去洗，\n阿志说要走。\n何老头从洗手间里顶着湿头发跑出来，\n抓住阿志的手说：\n“不走不走！吃个瓜再走！吃个瓜再走！”\n阿志说不了不了，何老头急得跺脚：\n“瓜太大！我一个人吃不完！切开了就要坏！”\n阿志就留下了。\n吃完瓜，\n何老头又要了阿志手机号，\n说自己的手机两星期没响了，\n以前还有推销电话，现在连推销的也没了。\n“那你女儿呢？”\n阿志说完，就觉得自己多了嘴。\n何老头长叹一口气：\n“不知道。”\n“那你没问问？”\n可能是觉得吃了别人的瓜，\n多少要说两句，阿志就又多了一嘴。\n“一年回来一次，死了给你下葬，\n就不错了，别想太多。”\n“问一问嘛，万一有什么事呢？”\n***\n最后还是问了。\n何老头拔了电话，开着免提，\n嘟到第五声，终于接通了。\n“爸？！怎么给我打电话了？！有事么？！”\n“啊……”\n“你现在在家么？！出什么事情了么？！”\n“在家，没事……”\n“那挂了啊～我正搬着东西呢！”\n嘟一下，电话就挂了。\n阿志不知道该说什么，\n屋里一片沉默。\n何老头把手机咣当扔到一边：\n“看，还没死就不能给女儿打电话！”\n这时，咚咚咚门响了。\n“开门！”\n是一个女人的声音。\n何老头噌一下从椅子上站起来，看着门口。\n“爸！快开门！东西拿不住了！”\n阿志冲过去，打开了门。\n***\n门外，是何老头的女儿。\n“你这个时候回来干什么？！”\n何老头又气又喜又不愿人看出来，\n一边说着气话一边从女儿手里接过东西，\n“西瓜都吃完了，早说就给你留一些！”\n“不用！我带了！”\n说着，何老头女儿转身抱进来一个大西瓜。\n阿志要走，\n父女俩实在热情，\n把阿志按在了椅子上，\n一定要留他吃晚饭。\n饭后，喝茶闲聊。\n何老头问阿志，\n三十多岁单身又没病，\n怎么就没想着找个老婆？\n阿志放下茶碗，犹豫了一下，\n讲起了自己从来没讲过的事。\n***\n三年前，有突变病毒时，\n阿志和女朋友准备领证，\n女朋友回父母家拿户口本。\n女朋友刚下车，\n病毒爆发，全城静默。\n被判为密接，立即隔离，\n凌晨被装上了转运大巴。\n然后就出了车祸。\n再也没能回来。\n阿志发了疯，打了人，\n被关进去了几个月。\n出来后，\n没了工作，也没了爱人，\n想着不如回家照顾父母，\n就回来了。\n刚到家，管控放开，\n所有人都得上了那个病。\n刚开始那两天，\n买不到药，只能硬扛。\n扛过去的人里，\n没有阿志的父母。\n***\n“日子过着没意思，\n没想过会干起快推。”\n阿志笑了笑，端起了茶碗。\n又坐了一会儿，阿志告辞，\n何老头女儿出门送客。\n“谢谢你来给我爸理发。”\n阿志想说：“不用谢，收了钱的”，\n忽然想起，收钱的事，又忘记了。\n***\n太阳落山了，\n天空是很深很深的蓝色，\n隐约有几颗星星在闪。\n一阵温热的夜风吹来，\n夹着一丝凉爽。\n这灼人的夏天，\n似乎真的要结束了。",

          "description": "之前写前端比较多，最近开始用 Spring boot 开发 api\n使用的是 JPA Hibernate orm+jdk21 方案，我不知道为什么感觉国内很多人不喜欢这个 Hibernate ，但是我自己用下来感觉非常好，它最牛逼的是可以按照 Entity 生成数据库结构，非常智能，所以你只要把实体定义好，一切都 ok 了，很容易维护。\n有个插件 JPA buddy ，非常好用，可以很好规范代码。\nJPA 也可以自定义 sql ，很灵活，除了在转成 json 的时候，会遇到无限循环的问题，其他感觉都很好。\n感觉 Spring boot 写后端，除了 JAVA 本身有点啰嗦，还有编译很浪费时间，其他都还蛮不错的。\n但是 JPA 通过 Entity 生成数据库的时候，为什么字段顺序和 Entity 是不一样的，是打乱的，，id 的位置会随机出现~~我槽，这就像要喝汤的时候飞进了一个苍蝇，我看网上有很多人说要 hack 一下，官方无解，但这个太离谱了。\n然后就是 CommandLineRunner ，我本来的需求是需要给项目 seed 一点初始化数据，这个 CommandLineRunner 只在启动的时候自动执行，不能通过 cli 命令执行，，泥马这个 CommandLineRunner 和 Command 一点关系都没有啊，我内个去，所以 seed 数据只能在 CommandLineRunner 加 if 条件。你去看人家 PHP laravel 都有 artisan cil 工具啊，这个可是天天都要用的，为啥你没有啊~~~你 Tomcat 都可以监听指令，为啥就不做一个监听 命令行指令的。\n后来我看了一个 spring boot cli 的插件，结果完全不是这个概念。。\n为什么这么成熟的框架连这些基本都做不好啊谁可以告诉我一下\n然后我现在在看 liquidbase 和 flyway ，还是 flyway 吧，直接 sql 多优雅，liquidbase 那个语法不能忍受~~\n谁能告诉我怎么才能优雅的搞后端呢？",

          "description": "《国产编程语言蓝皮书-2024 》作为该系列的第二版，根据前一版的经验和反馈，对编制方案进行了以下优化：\n增加了英文版，以扩大国际影响力，中英文版本将同步发布，内容保持一致；\n在项目申报资料中，为项目简介部分提供了建议内容清单，以促进项目展示的标准化；\n延长了项目申报的时间，给予申报者更多的准备时间，直至 2024 年 10 月底。\n编程语言是软件业的工业母机、编译器技术是信息产业的根技术，各种编程语言被用于操作系统、数据库管理系统、网络服务、工控设备、应用程序等的开发，渗透到了所有现代产业和服务领域。尤其是信息产业创新空间的持续扩展、系统复杂度的持续上升、开发成本的持续降低，都直接受益于不断涌现的编程语言和编译技术。\n迄今为止，国内几乎没有出现被广泛使用的编程语言，这与我国世界性工业大国、科技大国的地位相去甚远。\n国家政策层面，工业和信息化部发布的《“十四五”软件和信息技术服务业发展规划》中提到，应“强化基础组件供给……加快突破编程语言开发框架”；中国软件行业协会发布的《中国软件根技术发展白皮书（基础软件册）》第四章专门对编程语言和编译器的重要性、发展态势等进行了归纳。\n这些政策文件的发布，为编程语言产业的发展提供了坚实的支持。随着信息技术的多年积累，我国已经形成了一个庞大的产业群体，对编程语言这一基础工具的需求日益增长。特别是在大语言模型、国产芯片等新兴技术领域的快速发展，对编程语言提出了更多新的需求。\n回顾历史不难发现，与其他产业不同，作为信息产业的核心，编程语言的成功案例充满了偶然性。目前广泛使用的编程语言和开发工具，它们可能源自大型企业的商业推动，也可能源自个人或开源社区的创新。国内根软件行业呈现出项目高度分散化的趋势，企业和社区正在积极推动各种类型的编程语言项目，以满足不同领域的需求。\n随着国家对软件和信息技术服务业的重视，以及对基础软件的大力支持，国产编程语言的发展迎来了前所未有的机遇。《国产编程语言蓝皮书-2024 》的编制，正是响应国家政策，汇聚国内编程语言创新力量的重要举措。\n鉴于此，编程语言开放社区（ PLOC ）推出的《国产编程语言蓝皮书》，旨在全面收录并定期更新国内活跃且具有一定可用性的编程语言项目，为行业提供一个全面的国产编程语言概览。\n2023 版蓝皮书地址: https://www.ploc.org.cn/ploc/CNPL-2023.pdf\n原文: https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/8ZJXPSQZlAOZoEYUkzGQfA",

          "description": "这已经是第三次参加亚宠展了，它的全称是亚洲宠物展，展会涉及到各大厂商的粮食，零食，玩具，衣服，家具，洗护用品等等，一切你想到的和想不到的关于宠物的东西在这里都能找到 。\n记得几年前买家里的那只蓝猫时，原来猫主人就说等到了每年的亚宠展，就会带我们去薅羊毛，可以领到的东西非常的多，带个行李箱过去都会塞的满满当当的。\n现场很火爆\n去年参加了一次，今天参加了一次它博会，再加上这一次，全程下来，感觉很累很累，几千家的店铺分别在 W 系列馆，E 系列馆，N 系列馆，这所有的馆都走一遍，腿就已经酸的不行了，何况是每个馆都分布了几百家商铺，来来回回的兜圈。\n像那种大型的宠物商家，如渴望，巅峰这种，是热门中的大热门，需要很早很早就来会场抢，我们 9 点多过去就已经晚了，而这几次的疯狂小狗，弗列加特，蓝氏等等，由于商家送的东西很多，所以就吸引了很多人过来排队打卡。有时候活动还没有开始，门口就排了很长很长的队伍，看着现场很拥挤，很吓人，但是活动是很有秩序的，派发的也很多快，所以队伍流通的也很快。\n活动参与方式\n大部分商家的活动形式就是关注，关注小红书账号，关注抖音账号，关注淘宝账号就可以，有一些商家会让发一些小红书的笔记，笔记中带有商家的话题或者是亚宠展的话题，还有一些是我比较喜欢的形式，就是做游戏，商家会在现场准备游戏场地，比如套圈，丢沙包，像今年有一些新的游戏形式如愤怒的小鸟弹弓，砸铁锤等等。本来大家都比较疲惫，有时候排队时间比较长，通过这种游戏与运气的方式，能够有效的环节疲劳，增加趣味性。\n能薅到哪些羊毛\n取决于商家的类型，像卖食品的一边都会送一些猫粮，狗粮的试用装，或者是猫条，冻干，湿粮等等，而像一些洗护用品会送一些除臭剂，洗护剂，一些药品公司会送一些驱虫的试用装。一些装饰公司送了一些猫猫狗狗用的喝水的折叠碗或者是类似于子弹头的便携袋子。现场最不缺的就是各种袋子了，就是印有自己商标的各种大的购物袋。\n哪些人能参加\n这个展每年都会举办一次，一般都是举办 4,5 天，前 3 天都是面向商家或者是专业观众的，后两天是面对消费者的。所谓的专业观众就是有猫猫狗狗的宠物店店主等，我理解的前面三天都是商家谈合作的，对于我们这种普通的猫猫狗狗的家长来说，一般就选在周六周天去。\n除了薅羊毛还能干啥\n有些人可能说，对于那些试用装我没有兴趣，我有钱，想买就直接买了，为什么要浪费时间去薅羊毛？其实，去参加这个展会，也是开阔自己眼界的一个方式，像去年认识了疯狂小狗这个品牌，从此就一直关注了它，发现它一直在举办各种宠物的活动，有时候有空了就会带宠物参加。\n其次，现场也会有这种优质的宠物宝宝们，不仅有猫猫，狗狗，也会有各种比较小众的宠物，如安哥拉兔子，仓鼠，乌龟，蜥蜴，蛇等，看似小众，这些展位往往人山人海，大家都有猎奇的心理。比如说养蛇，你平时会比较会很少见到，但是在这个展会上你会见到来自全国各地来的宠物爱好者。\n不过今年参加下来，明显感觉冷淡了很多，不仅能耗到的羊毛少了，而且周六去的，发现有些小场地商家已经开始撤场了，有的在做清仓大甩卖，也不难理解，商家们大老远的运这些产品来上海，也不想再付一笔运费又把它们运回去。",

          "description": "好啦好啦我知道已经有很多类似的帖子了（今天早上 Google 了「 site:v2ex.com 女朋友生日送什么好」了以后浏览完了 57 篇帖子···）但是不同时间提问 回答的人会不同嘛\n女朋友下周就要 28 岁了（划掉，18 岁），爱好一下子能想到的有：玩游戏（端游）、“她说蓝色是她最爱的颜色”、玉桂狗、荔枝（水果）\nℹ️几个她最近提过的点：\n❶久坐腰不舒服——但这也是我的困惑 而我自己都一直没能发现什么好的解决方法（除了不久坐）\n❷在某一个晚上突然提过想要去拍一套什么写真，但这个还得确认她到底要不要去拍，如果真的要去拍或许可以当成礼物？\n❸还提过想要下次见面的时候点香薰（所以需要买香薰），但这个因为要一起享用所以应该不能算作单方面的礼物叭···\n过去送给过她的礼物：一个蓝色的 Xbox 无线手柄（后来才知道她自己已经有一个有线的 Xbox 手柄了···）、玉桂狗的内衣、蓝色的围巾、手写贺卡\n她送给过我的礼物：加盖她唇印的手写贺卡、她自己、潘多拉的对戒（当时因为样式我没有很喜欢所以···没有要）、LV 的手链（太贵重了！所以也没有要）、书包钱包等等她想给我买但是我也没有要，因为感觉不是很需要耶\n所以她应该不需要很“贵重”的礼物，她自己的一个发卡都要两千多欧（实际上她说我送什么她都喜欢，从之前送过的礼物来看确实是这样）\n🙂‍↔️这次生日「不太考虑」送的礼物及原因：\n❶香水：因为想要送给她的香水(Jo by Jo Loves)希望她当场闻过喜欢后再买给她\n❷拍立得：因为有计划明年年底前去日本迪士尼，所以打算之后去日本旅游的时候再买（疑似🫓我知道）\n❸酒水：57 篇帖子里有人提到过送酒水其实我也不太知道为什么···女朋友不跟我在一起的时候其实不喝酒，所以即便考虑到女朋友喜欢荔枝可以考虑荔枝酒，但这应该也会因为只有跟我在一起的时候才喝从而没办法算作单方面的礼物吧···（类似香薰）\n❹ Watch：理由类似香水，虽然因为女朋友月经不是很准，确实希望她可以利用手表来预测排卵期（已经确认她习惯戴表），但即便这样也需要她当场试戴确定了喜欢的样式以后才能买，而且我自己也想换新了，所以在等比较值得买的一代（顺便等我工作了就可以用自己的工资给她买了）\n❺双人游：感觉我目前不太有 cover 掉全程全款的能力（虽然有意向目的地 但是单单双人双程机票就要£550 呜呜呜）\n❻闪现：有考虑过下周直接飞过去，但是她会加班，所以就只能还是视频了···\n❼清空购物车：感觉她不是很需要我给她花钱···",

          "description": "背景\n女朋友是今年的应届生，普通本科 视觉传达设计专业，父母在北京这边做点小生意，我也在北京，所以她实习就在北京，工作也在这儿找。\n水平在我看来是挺不错的，不管是平时那些设计作业，还是最后的毕业设计，我看了都觉得眼前一亮，在她们专业成绩也一直是第一名。\n知道这个学历和专业实在算不上好，所以预期并不高，大厂只是投一下简历凑个热闹，主要还是在找小公司 10k 以下的设计类工作，没想到这种要求了，还这么难。\n主要经过\n3-5 月\n在一家在线教育公司的平面设计岗实习，公司比较大，也比较规范，虽然钱不多，她干得挺开心，领导们评价也不错。5 月底回校准备毕业展的时候，跟领导确认无法转正，没有坑位，很洒脱地就辞了，想着毕业之后再找。结果，这一找，就找到了现在。\n6 月至今\n6 月份的时候我没怎么问，她自己也想先玩几天，有一搭没一搭地投简历，自然是没什么结果。进入 7 月份，她就有点急了，本来投的还都是上家公司那种规模的（ 1000+），无果后开始投各种小公司，结果还是没回音。\n我们俩商量，不行了，得换策略。\n不局限于文化行业了，各种行业的，但凡是个设计岗，都投。\n大部分岗位动辄要求两三年工作经验，所以现在就不在乎薪资了，只要能入职，工资低无所谓，积攒点工作经验以后再跳。\n有效果，陆续开始收到面试了，大多都是 10-50 个人的公司，给的薪资也都是 5-6K 。陆陆续续参加了十几次面试，结果，竟然一个都没能找到。我给大家挑几个典型的说一下：\n几个典型\n新型书店：早 10 晚 7 、偶尔出差、双休、五险一金、7K\n这是最想去的一个，公司实际上是个 书店+咖啡店+会场服务 的模式。排除掉服务员厨师什么的，算上老板一共就不到十个人。\n第一轮面试的时候，跟面试官聊得很好，面试官都让准备好入职手续了，说问下老板意见，应该没有大问题，结果老板要求加一轮面试。\n老板的那场面试，女朋友说全程没捞着说话，老板从工作内容讲到国家经济发展形势，又讲到人生哲理和对年轻人的殷切嘱托，然后就结束了，可以走了。\n第一轮的面试官说，老板有些其他顾虑，但是她本人非常认可，所以她会帮忙再争取下。然后，就没信了。\n打印店：早 8 晚 8 、单休、五险、7K\n说是某某文化公司，实际上是个大一点的打印店，所以会接一点帮小公司做点宣传册的设计工作。在招聘软件上确认了上述条件后，去现场面试了。\n出来面试的是打印店老板，对上述谈好的条件都不清楚，从头开始谈。PUA 一番后说工资 6K ，女友表示接受之后他突然说，刚才看错了，以为是有两年经验，没想到是个刚毕业的，那 6K 就不行了，只能给 4K 。再次表示接受之后，又说，工作时间不固定，只要店里有顾客就不能下班，五险一金统统没有，说团队培养新人也要成本云云。\n能看出来，人家就是不想要，所以也没有再纠缠。\n传媒公司&电玩城：早 11 晚 10 、月休 4 天、五险、5K\n老板有个电玩城，还有个传媒公司。所以去了之后既要给电玩城设计优惠券宣传图，还要给传媒公司设计些海报。从这个工作时间也能看出来还得兼电玩城服务人员。\n去面试，一开始，老板和副总就架个手机在那儿拍我对象。自我介绍完了之后，一边调整手机一边让重新说一遍，拍完之后两个人就走了，剩个戴眼镜的男的面试。问了包含星座血型 MBTI 等各种信息，让我对象详细介绍了自己的家庭情况和人生经历，然后开始点评。对象一边哭一边跟我复述他那些油腻到让人不适的发言，我都能想象这个老男人是用什么样的眼神打量眼前的年轻女孩。\n我的感受\n不找了，找个屁，这些狗屎工作工资还没我的零头高。我知道这是社会中的大多数，我也不是想抱怨，我只是觉得，我实在没必要让我对象吃这样的苦。她在家爱干啥干啥，网上接单作图一个月也能赚两三千了。\n但是她接受不了。\n好歹也是个本科生，她想不通为什么找个本专业的工作这么难，也接受不了自己只能做这样的工作。我想劝劝她，可最后也只能长叹一声，咋办呢？各位老哥？",

          "description": "先介绍下背景，坐标欧洲，家宽是墙上 RJ45 网口直接 DHCP 获取公网静态 IPv4 ，无 IPv6 ，这个 IPv4 似乎是跟着 MAC 地址的，只要 MAC 地址不变，这个公网 IPv4 就不变。平时插着一个小米路由器来用。\n然后我有台旧的 ThinkPad ，运行 Win10 ，Windows Update 一直开着的，平时一直都会更新到最新版。很多年了一直 24 小时运行，当个服务器用，平时跑些东西，没跑 HTTP ，也有在路由器上映射一些端口方便公网直接访问，主要是 3389 和 SSH （ Windows 自带的 OpenSSH ），当然在公网上的端口不是 3389 和 22 ，不过现在这似乎并不重要，人家都是直接扫服务的。还有一些其它端口是做 Tailscale 的跳板，也就是把我的 Tailscale 其它一些设备的一些端口通过这台 ThinkPad 跳到公网上，方便在外面不需要通过 Tailscale 来直接访问我的 Tailscale 网络中的一些设备。直接用的是 Windows 的 portproxy 。\n很多年了一直很稳定，这 ThinkPad 从来没死过机，没出过问题，平时基本就在旁边吃灰。\n然后今年 6 月 24 日我回国休假，记得 6 月 25 日我还在国内试着连了下这 ThinkPad 的 3389 ，看看速度啊啥的，也没用来干啥事。然后 26 号以后就连不上了，Tailscale 也显示这台机子离线。当时我也没管，因为想着可能死机了或者网崩了啥的，无所谓了到时回去了再看看怎么回事。\n然后今天刚回到欧洲，诡异的事情来了！！！！！\n第一件事是先发现 WIFI 上不了网，手机能连上小米路由器 WIFI ，但是无网络，登后台页面说 DHCP 无响应。以为路由器出了什么幺蛾子，第一时间重启路由器嘛，还是不行。\n然后看了下 ThinkPad ，发现 ThinkPad 死机了，按大小写灯不亮，屏幕也不亮，先没管，想着先去弄好网络先，看看网络怎么回事\n插拔了几次网线/重启路由都提示 DHCP 无响应，于是试试直接把网线插电脑上，但是网线插我电脑上又能获取到 IP 能正常上网，第一反应是路由器 WAN 口的 MAC 地址被运营商封了？然后路由器 WAN 口改个 MAC 地址，马上能获取 DHCP 能上网了，但是没过几秒又断网了，然后 DHCP 又获取不到地址了，像是被秒封了（划重点！）。\n这时无意间看到 ThinkPad 连着的交换机灯在狂闪（ ThinkPad 通过一个千兆有线交换机连到小米路由 LAN 口，此时交换机上没有除了 ThinkPad 和小米路由之外的设备），这时还是死机状态，连的显示器不亮，按大小写键盘灯不亮，风扇也不转说明 CPU 不热），于是我长按电源键强行关机重启了下 ThinkPad 。一重启网马上就正常了，小米路由 DHCP 马上有响应，马上能上网，甚至路由 MAC 地址都没改，然后改回路由默认的 WAN 口 MAC 地址也能正常上网正常获取 IP 了，一切都恢复正常了。\n妈也，细思极恐，不知道是不是我的 ThinkPad 被黑了有人做肉鸡一直 DDoS 啥的然后导致一插网线就被运营商封？现在我也还原不了现场了，ThinkPad 重启后一切都正常了，不知道当时交换机灯狂闪在那闪什么，早知应该当时直接把路由器 WAN 口插电脑上然后开 Wireshark 抓个包。\n看了下 ThinkPad 的 Windows 日志，系统那一栏没有什么异常，到 6 月 26 号晚上 19 点之后就没有了，像是突然死机的那种。\n然后安全那一栏能看到很多登录失败的，像是 3389/SSH 被爆破\n\n以前也遇到过也没什么，我也没弱密码，单纯爆破应该发生不了这些事情\n对了，这台 ThinkPad 上还装有火绒，基本上只打开了文件监控和下载防护，火绒没杀到什么毒，今天也 Windows Update 了一波，那个恶意软件删除工具也没杀到东西。简单看了下进程啥的都没有异常。\n这一切事件太诡异了，首先之前这么久从来没出过问题，稳定得一逼，偏偏在我回国休假第二天出的问题（难道我被搞了？），然后死机就死机吧，这死机的时候交换机灯还狂闪还搞得上不了网，虽然我不知道是不是真的是 ThinkPad 发出什么有问题的包被运营商封，但是一强行关机重启马上就正常。而且当时确实路由器改 WAN 口 MAC 地址之后得了这么几秒，然后又一模一样的现象了，直到重启 ThinkPad ，真的太诡异了。\n害，有没有哥们支下招，有什么要检查的，最好能查查到底发生了什么",

          "description": "2024年9月7日，一名叫“亚人”的网红在北京圆明园游玩时，一位翻译让其“让一下”给日本游客拍照，随后发生口角。网红表示，“你在圆明园，让我给日本人让位？” \n\r\n\r\n2024年9月9日，针对日本游客在圆明园拍照被网红制止一事，外交部回应：不会针对任何特定国家采取歧视性做法。\n\r\n\r\n2024年9月8日，人民日报旗下《环球人物》发文，批判网红制止日本人在圆明园拍照行为，并声称“民族大义不是流量密码”，“盲目排外在我国没有土壤”。以下是全文：\n\r\n\r\n\r\n9月7日，网名“亚人”的网红在圆明园游玩，一名翻译在日本游客拍照时要求“亚人”让一下，受到“亚人”的拒绝、阻止。“亚人”的网名来自同名日本动漫，目前，“亚人”在某短视频平台上有32万粉丝。\n\r\n\r\n事件发生后，大部分网友认为无端阻止日本游客拍照，非常不合适，有损大国形象。在网友质疑声中，“亚人”很快将帐号中的几百部视频作品删除。\n\r\n\r\n我国的72/144小时过境免签政策，已让包括日本游客在内的大批外国游客亲自感受到了中国的开放与亲和——“中国社会既安全又自由”“中国人很热情，乐于助人”“交通便利，移动支付发达，生活便捷”。英美澳媒体对中国的“滤镜式报道”不攻自破。\n\r\n\r\n此外，有网友发现了疑似“亚人”当年在美国留学期间的犯罪记录。\n\r\n\r\n盲目排外在我国没有土壤，民族大义不是流量密码，“亚人”自以为抓住了“增粉神器”，没想到无人捧场。此前，一个名叫原田将太的日本网红，专门“碰瓷”中国游客，故意夸大中国游客在日行为，吸引日本的“无脑爱国粉”。目前，此人劣迹已被翻出：曾在疫情期间，在明知自己感染新冠的情况下，不戴口罩，去了多家人员聚集餐厅传播病毒，引起日本网民愤怒。\n\r\n\r\n换位思考一下，能对素不相识、行为规范的陌生人，恶意地谩骂的人，也不太值得尊敬吧。（刘潇）",

          "description": "《异形》是一系列科幻恐怖电影。首集《异形》（Alien，1979年）由雷德利·斯科特执导，之后又推出了三部续集《异形2》（Aliens，1986年）、《异形3》（Alien 3，1992年）、《异形4》（Alien: Resurrection，1997年）以及一部独立间传《异形：夺命舰》（Alien: Romulus，2024年）；雷德利·斯科特还执导了异形的前传系列《普罗米修斯》（Prometheus，2012年）和《异形：契约》（Alien: Covenant，2017年）。\n\r\n\r\n异形1\n\r\n\r\n2122年，商业太空船“诺斯特罗莫号”在航行途中收到了一组不明信号，飞船前往信号源地进行搜救，船员们在神秘星球的调查过程中，意外释放了一种致命的外星生物“异形”，“诺斯特罗莫号”的船员们不得不与异形展开了一场惊心动魄的战斗。\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n异形2\n\r\n\r\n延续了前作的恐怖氛围，讲述了女主角在57年后（2179年）被救回地球后，与一支海军陆战队一起返回被异形入侵的殖民星球，与异形进行殊死搏斗的故事。\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n异形3\n\r\n\r\n剧情紧接着第二部，2179年，女主角逃亡的飞船出现意外，坠落在一个阴冷黑暗的星球上，这个星球是一个关押犯人的太空监狱，只有一群被遗弃的囚犯和看守，异形也侵入了这个星球，由于这个星球上没有现代武器和科技，女主角和囚犯们只能依靠原始的工具来对抗异形。\n\r\n\r\n更糟糕的是，女主角发现，在她体内还有一只雌性异形正在成长，最后，女主角和已经破体而出的异形一起投入了高温熔炉同归于尽。\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n异形4\n\r\n\r\n2379年，女主角死亡后200年，在一艘名叫“贝蒂”的太空船上，科学家们通过克隆技术复活了女主角，并从她体内取出了异形女王的胚胎。\n\r\n\r\n科学家们希望利用异形进行研究，但事情很快失控，异形逃脱并开始猎杀船员，女主角和一群雇佣兵联手对抗这个致命的恐怖生物。\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n普罗米修斯\n\r\n\r\n《异形》的前传，故事发生在2089年，考古学家伊丽莎白·肖和同事在苏格兰的斯凯岛找到了一份星图，在韦兰公司的赞助下组建一支探险队，搭乘“普罗米修斯号”飞船出发前往星图所指引的行星LV-223，查找制造人类的“工程师”外星人，试图揭开人类起源的谜团。\n\r\n\r\n飞船飞行过程中船员都处于休眠状态，由人形机器人大卫监控旅程，飞船于2093年到达目的地，结果发现外星人制造了一种黑色液体的生物武器想要毁灭地球上的人类，女考古学家带领普罗米修斯号撞击外星飞船以阻止外星人的企图，而外星人最终被巨型抱脸虫杀死，并生下了第一个异形。\n\r\n\r\n2094年，女考古学家和机器人大卫一同开着外星飞船前往外星人的母星，了解为什么他们要毁灭人类。\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n异形：契约\n\r\n\r\n《普罗米修斯》的续集，2094年，女考古学家和机器人大卫在前往外星人母星的途中，由于拥有自主意识的大卫改变想法，害死了女考古学家，并将黑色病原体遍布外星人母星，致使他们种族灭绝，大卫则留在该星球进行研发异形的实验，成功用黑色病原体创造出各种异形生物。\n\r\n\r\n2104年，“契约号”殖民太空船载有15名船员和2000名殖民者前往欧瑞伽六号星球，因收到不明消息，船员们决定改变航线，前往信号发出的星球进行探索。\n\r\n\r\n在那里，他们遇到了《普罗米修斯》中的机器人大卫，并遭到异形的感染和袭击，在契约号船员对抗异形的过程中，机器人大卫蒙骗了他们，并混入契约号，带着异形胚胎，独自驾驶着契约号飞往目的地。\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n异形：夺命舰\n\r\n\r\n《异形系列》的第七部电影作品，故事发生在《异形1》剧情后的20年，2142年，一艘韦兰德太空探测器调查了二十年前被摧毁的诺斯特罗莫号的残骸，科学家打开了陨石，里面有一只异形。\n\r\n\r\n几个月后，一群年轻的太空殖民者，为了逃离殖民地，前往探索一艘废弃的公司太空船时，意外遭遇了宇宙中最恐怖的生命体：“异形”。",
