          "description": "Our bias is to always add more. More rules, more process, more code, more features, more stuff. Interdependencies proliferate, and gradually strangle us. Systems want to grow and grow, but without pruning, they collapse. Slowly, then spectacularly.\nWhen a piece of trash drifts across the beach, it is our duty to pick it up so the next person can enjoy a pristine shoreline. When a thousand pieces litter the beach, it is too late. We can only lament the landscape. That’s just how beaches are now.\nA good system is designed to be periodically cleared of cruft. It has a built-in counterbalance. Without this pressure, our bias drives us to add band-aid after band-aid, until the only choice is to destroy the whole system and start from scratch.\nWhy is it so much easier to add than to remove? Maybe because we attach our identity to what is visible. But there is a difference between the ornamentation that defines our style and the vestigial burdens we carry.\nRemember those who did the invisible work of removing. Their legacy was not to build a sand castle, but to care for the beautiful beach on which we play.",

          "description": "Hi, everyone. I created a note-taking website for electronics and circuits where you can draw circuit diagrams and write text notes at the same time.\nI am a Digital IC designer, and I self-study different types of analog and digital circuits a lot. However, I found a problem. Circuits have many different architectures and are hard to memorize due to numerous experiential tips. I want to document what I learn in my note app, but I found there is no method for me to easily draw circuit and block diagrams alongside text notes.\nThis issue has bothered me for a long time, from my master's school to my current working life. I decided to solve it, so I created a note-taking website specifically for electronics and circuits, called VisCircuit.\nWith VisCircuit, you can easily draw circuit diagrams, block diagrams, and write text notes simultaneously. I have already used it for two weeks and have noted down things I find hard to remember, such as SRAM, amplifier circuits, and PCB components of Arduino and Raspberry Pi. I found this tool really useful for memorizing knowledge about electronics and circuits.\nCurrently, I have opened VisCircuit for alpha testing, and I want to let some people use it and give me feedback. Feel free to try it, and I will really appreciate what you think about this project. Leave any suggestions for improvement. Thank you very much.\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40987770\nPoints: 32\n# Comments: 1",

See a demo: https://www.traceloop.com/video or try it yourself at https://www.traceloop.com/docs/demo.\nWhen moving your LLM app to production, significant scale makes it harder for engineers and data scientists alike to understand when their LLM is hallucinating or returning malformed responses. When you get to millions of calls to OpenAI a month, methods like “LLM as a judge” can’t work at a reasonable cost or latency. So, what most people we talked to usually do is sample some generations by hand, maybe for some specific important customers, and manually look for errors or hallucinations.\nTraceloop is a monitoring platform that d…",

          "description": "Hey Hacker News!\nThis is my first post here. About 5 months ago, I left my job because I was completely burnt out. After taking some time off, I started freelancing. But I found tracking my time to be a real hassle as I kept forgetting to start or stop the timer and often had no idea what I’d worked on.\nSo, I decided to build Taim as a side project, while also working now on some freelancing gigs. Taim is going to be automated time tracking tool for freelancers and teams. It’s designed to make tracking time effortless and accurate, so you can focus on your work and not worry about the clock.\nI’m excited to share this with you all and would love your feedback! Currently planning to launch it to the public in a few months.\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40977453\nPoints: 92\n# Comments: 57",

          "description": "Sometime in early 2022, my wife and I started watching Jeopardy! regularly, almost by accident. Inspired, I thought it would be fun to create and host my own games with family and friends.\nBy September 2022, I debuted Buzzinga at a family reunion. Back then, it was just a website running locally on my MacBook. It was a total blast, and I knew this was something the world should enjoy too.\nI launched Buzzinga.io in December 2023 and have been rolling out regular updates for our 2000+ users ever since.\nFeatures:\n- Built-in buzzer support (phones and physical buzzers)\n- Automatic scorekeeping\n- User-friendly host controls\n- Highly customizable\n- Supports multiple clue types: text, image, audio, and video\nThe site does not require sign up to play around with, only to create your own games.\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40960508\nPoints: 161\n# Comments: 38",

          "description": "Hey everyone, James from Silogy here.\nWe’re excited to open-source our test runner, Smelt. Smelt is a simple and extensible test runner optimized for chip development workflows. Smelt enables developers to:\n* Programmatically define numerous test variants\n* Execute these tests in parallel\n* Easily analyze test results\nAs chip designs get more complex, the state space that needs to be explored in design verification is exploding. In chip development, it's common to run thousands of tests, each with multiple hyperparameters that result in even more variation. Smelt offers a straightforward approach to generating test variants and extracting valuable insights from your test runs. Smelt integrates seamlessly with most popular simulators and other chip design tools.\nKey features:\n* Procedural test generation: Programmatically generate tests with python\n* Automatic rerun on failure: Describe the computation required re-run failing tests\n* Analysis APIs: All of the data needed to track and reproduce tests\n* Extensible: Define your tests with a simple python interface\nYves (https://github.com/silogy-io/yves) is a suite of directed performance tests that we brought up with smelt – check it out if you’d like to see smelt in action.\nRepo: https://github.com/silogy-io/smelt\nWe built Smelt to streamline the testing process for chip developers. We're eager to hear your feedback and see how it performs in your projects!\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40945671\nPoints: 39\n# Comments: 0",

          "description": "I'm tired of working full-time at companies that waste my talent and energy. I want to work for myself.\nAs a side hustle for the last few years, I've been designing custom concert visuals and releasing them on a monthly schedule. I've released 48 VJ packs so far and created a following within the niche community of VJs. These VJ performers then remix my visuals into their live performances at concerts. My setup is unique in that you can download every VJ pack by becoming a member on Patreon.\nI want to take it to the next level and make it into a full-time business but I'm struggling to figure out next steps. It would be helpful to get an outsider's perspective since there are so few people doing this line of work and I feel a bit lost.\nAs far as I can see, there are two routes to go down:\n1) Create custom visuals for touring musicians. Should I find a rep or agency to represent me for landing big projects? Should I start reaching out directly to the business managers of musicians? Should I start a company with a partner?\n2) Continue making VJ packs for thousands of VJs internationally. Should I move to an annual membership fee instead of a monthly membership fee on Patreon? Should I move to an online shop format instead of a Patreon membership?\nBiz folk, what am I missing? What am I not considering? Thanks!\nhttps://www.jasonfletcher.info/vjloops/ --- https://www.patreon.com/isoscelesVJ\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40945532\nPoints: 16\n# Comments: 10",

          "description": "Even when these things have proven themselves to be very useful in widespread use.\nThis is something that is playing a major part in impeding my progress, blocking my motivation to learning some tech skills that are more in demand. Especially since I currently have no job, so there is no real-world frame of reference to understand why they could be important. Why they could save my butt one day or make my life easier.\nAt some point, long ago (2012-ish) I was no longer required to do deployment for web, but unfortunately I never caught up because I was never made responsible for production ever again. So I am just familiar with old ways of deployment and missed out on a lot of changes that led to where full-stack web dev is today.\nThis mostly goes for a lot of skills in CI/CD and cloud that are in demand these days. Some of it comes up more in full-stack job interviews, in terms of, do you have experience with XYZ or how would you use XYZ in some situation. I have no good answer for them because I haven't really learned how to use them. And I haven't learned how to use them because I can't come up with problem scenarios where they are a possible solution. For instance, why do I need Jenkins and Chef when I can already test, SSH and add scripts and cron jobs no problem. Why would I need the cloud when my past jobs and clients got by well with a cheap shared host. For uploading files I just needed to know at least two of these three- Git, rsync, and SFTP.\nIt's not that I actually believe most of these things are \"useless\". But rather that my mind can't draw a good problem scenario for them. So from my POV they look like solutions looking for a problem. Maybe my experience just has no good frame of reference for those things.\nDiscovering a context, a frame of reference to understand these tools and apply them- especially without a job -that's what I want to figure out.\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40940158\nPoints: 30\n# Comments: 26",

          "description": "Hi HN!\nI just released version 1.0 of Posting, an open source terminal application I've been working on which you might find useful if you work with, test, or develop HTTP APIs!\nPosting (https://github.com/darrenburns/posting) is an HTTP client, not unlike Postman and Insomnia. However, as a TUI application, it works over SSH and enables efficient keyboard-centric workflows. Your requests are stored locally in simple readable YAML files, meaning they're easy to read and version control.\nSome other features include:\n- \"Jump mode\" navigation\n- Environments/variables with autocompletion\n- Syntax highlighting powered by tree-sitter\n- Vim keys support in much of the UI\n- Various builtin themes\n- A config system\n- \"Open in $EDITOR\"\n- A fuzzy search command palette for quickly accessing functionality.\nPosting is written in Python using the Textual[1] framework, which I also help maintain.\nAlthough 1.0 has been released, it's not yet feature complete. I'd love to hear feedback from the community to make sure I'm on the right track and learn what's important to people.\nSo, if you have any thoughts, feature requests, or opinions, big or small, I'd love to hear them. At this early stage, your ideas can really help shape the roadmap of the project!\nThanks,\nDarren\n[1] Textual: https://github.com/Textualize/textual\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40926211\nPoints: 102\n# Comments: 34",

          "description": "I've noticed an interesting feature in Chrome and Chromium: they seem to isolate internal audio from the microphone input. For instance, when I'm on a Google Meet call in one tab and playing a YouTube video at full volume in another tab, the video’s audio isn’t picked up by Google Meet. This isolation doesn’t happen if I use different browsers for each task (e.g., Google Meet on Chrome and YouTube on Chromium).\nDoes anyone know how Chrome and Chromium achieve this audio isolation?\nGiven that Chromium is open source, it would be helpful if someone could point me to the specific part of the codebase that handles this. Any insights or technical details would be greatly appreciated!\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40918152\nPoints: 112\n# Comments: 61",

          "description": "Hi HN, I’m Joan, the developer of Quicklang. I made this app to easily translate and keep in sync all my localization JSON files for my side projects. While searching online for a similar tool, I only found enterprise solutions that do not allow direct editing of JSON files.\nI used to use ChatGPT to translate the JSON translation file changes before coding Quicklang. However, I realized that ChatGPT only allows you to input short content for translation into another language (even if you provide a .json file), and each time I had to request translations for one language at a time. So, I decided to build an app that only sends the changes I’ve made to the OpenAI API and easily translates them into all the target languages for my side projects.\nTechnical details: I used Next.js to build the front end and backend, and I use a custom VPS (EC2 instance) on AWS to handle the translation process. This is because the translation can take several minutes, and Vercel Functions time out after 10 seconds by default (up to 60 seconds on the Hobby plan). Finally, I save the translation files in an S3 bucket.\nWhat’s next? I want to add cool features like change history, the capability to add context to the OpenAI API to make translations as accurate as possible, and maybe allow developers to interact with the API in order to use the tool.\nLet me know your thoughts and feedback. It’s been a blast working on this so far, and I think it’s just neat :)\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40907528\nPoints: 26\n# Comments: 17",

          "description": "I love Jupyter – it's how I learned to code back when I was working as a scientist. But I was always frustrated that there wasn't a simple and elegant app that I could use with my Mac. I made do by wrapping JupyterLab in a chrome app, and then more recently switching to VS Code to make use of Copilot. I've always craved a more focused and lighter-weight experience when working in a notebook. That's why I created Satyrn.\nIt starts up really fast (faster time-to-execution than VS Code or JupyterLab), you can launch notebooks right from the Finder, and the design is super minimalist. It's got an OpenAI integration (use your own API key) for multi-cell generation with your notebook as context (I'll add other LLMs soon). And many more useful features like a virtual environment management UI, Black code formatting, and easy image/table copy buttons.\nFull disclosure: it's built with Electron. I originally wrote it in Swift but couldn't get the editor experience to where I wanted it. Now it supports autocomplete, multi-cursor editing, and moving the cursor between cells just like you'd expect from JupyterLab or VS Code.\nSatyrn sits on top of the jupyter-server, so it works with all your existing python kernels, Jupyter configuration, and ipynb files. It only works with local files at the moment, but I'm planning to extend it to support remote servers as well.\nI'm an indie developer, and I will try to monetize at some point, but it's free while in alpha. If you're interested, please try it out!\nI'd love your feedback in the comments, or you can contact me at jack-at-satyrn-dot-app.\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40899242\nPoints: 182\n# Comments: 60",

          "description": "Hi all! Excited to share rss2newsletter after completing dev work for the initial release.\nThe idea for this project came out of necessity, as I wanted to share my articles via email newsletter. I was looking for a super minimal, lightweight, and open source solution, and when none existed, I decided to create one.\nFor any sizable number of email recipients, a popular platform like Mailchimp will easily cost you hundreds or even thousands per month in per-contact fees. rss2newsletter, on the other hand, allows you to use Amazon SES, so you can reach your audience at pennies on the dollar.\nBeyond these factors, I also wanted something that could run on an internet-connected potato it's so easy on your system and fully automated so you can set it and forget it.\nSo, I created (and put under a free software license):\nhttps://github.com/ElliotKillick/rss2newsletter\nrss2newsletter (integrating with Listmonk and Amazon SES for ultra-low-cost emails) is a drop-in solution that requires almost no setup besides connecting with SES and styling your emails. It's also competitive at what it does with proprietary self-hosted solutions like Sendy, which requires your system/VPS to have some rather beefy specs to run well.\nLet me know if there are any other features you would like to see. I hope you can find my project helpful to you!\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40898313\nPoints: 32\n# Comments: 11",

          "description": "I've created Foorr, a minimal to-do list app that focuses on short-term getting-things-done and the option to do this with friends by holding each other accountable and helping each other grow together. Main goal is to fuel your progress whatever needs to be done and hold yourself accountable for your own progress (with some external motivation).\nHere's what it does:\n- Create tasks for today and tomorrow only (real hyperfocus on short term GTD).\n- Invite friends to cheer each other moving forward.\n- Building up a daily streak as you finish all tasks daily. All tasks completed before midnight which were planned for that day, earns you a level up. Rewarding that sense of completion.\nWhy I built it:\nI used physical post-it notes and was a bit done with it. I really wanted something minimal focusing only on my to-do's for today and tomorrow.\nNo bloated features, nothing to fancy/polished, just something no-nonsense I wanted to use myself. It might be useful for others who struggle with procrastination and keeping op progress getting things actually done. Feedback is definitely welcome and nice to hear if this resonates with anyone else.\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40877708\nPoints: 14\n# Comments: 8",

Over the last 5 years, we've experienced many ups and downs:\n- Gained early customers\n- Quit our day jobs\n- Secured angel funding\n- Survived with a short runway\n- Accepted into Techstars Chicago\n- Survived with a short runway (again)\n- Landed our biggest client ever, a Fortune 100 company\n- Despite our highest revenue, our burn rate caught up to us\nWe looked at different ways to wind down the company and ultimately felt open sourcing the platform was the best way to do right by our customers.\nNow, anyone who is interested in starting a VR company or just building an app can pick up where we left off. I'm excited about this space, if you need help with a VR app, or want to talk tech, please reach out.\nCheck out the repo: https://github.com/transferthought/transfer-thought\nContact me at keenan [at] transferthought [dot] com.\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40869706\nPoints: 7\n# Comments: 0",

          "description": "jb is a UNIX tool that creates JSON, for shell scripts or interactive use. Its \"one thing\" is to get shell-native data (environment variables, files, program output) to somewhere else, using JSON encapsulate it robustly.\nI wrote this because I wanted a robust and ergonomic way to create ad-hoc JSON data from the command line and scripts. I wanted errors to not pass silently, not coerce data types, not put secrets into argv. I wanted to leverage shell features/patterns like process substitution, environment variables, reading/streaming from files and null-terminated data.\nIf you know of the jo program, jb is similar, but type-safe by default and more flexible. jo coerces types, using flags like -n to coerce to a specific type (number for -n), without failing if the input is invalid. jb encodes values as strings by default, requiring type annotations to parse & encode values as a specific type (failing if the value is invalid).\nIf you know jq, jb is complementary in that jq is great at transforming data already in JSON format, but it's fiddly to get non-JSON data into jq. In contrast, jb is good at getting unstructured data from arguments, environment variables and files into JSON (so that jq could use it), but jb cannot do any transformation of data, only parsing & encoding into JSON types.\nI feel rather guilty about having written this in bash. It's something of a boiled frog story. I started out just wanting to encode JSON strings from a shell script, without dependencies, with the intention of piping them into jq. After a few trials I was able to encode JSON strings in bash with surprising performance, using array operations to encode multiple strings at once. It grew from there into a complete tool. I'd certainly not choose bash if I was starting from scratch now...\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40864541\nPoints: 116\n# Comments: 42",

          "description": "Hi! I wanted to share an open source API-compatible replacement for SQS. It's written in Go, distributes as a single binary, and uses SQLite for underlying storage.\nI wrote this because I wanted a queue with all the bells and whistles - searching, scheduling into the future, observability, and rate limiting - all the things that many modern task queue systems have.\nBut I didn't want to rewrite my app, which was already using SQS. And I was frustrated that many of the best solutions out there (BullMQ, Oban, Sidekiq) were language-specific.\nSo I made an SQS-compatible replacement. All you have to do is replace the endpoint using AWS' native library in your language of choice.\nFor example, the queue works with Celery - you just change the connection string. From there, you can see all of your messages and their status, which is hard today in the SQS console (and flower doesn't support SQS.)\nIt is written to be pluggable. The queue implementation uses SQLite, but I've been experimenting with RocksDB as a backend and you could even write one that uses Postgres. Similarly, you could implement multiple protocols (AMQP, PubSub, etc) on top of the underlying queue. I started with SQS because it is simple and I use it a lot.\nIt is written to be as easy to deploy as possible - a single go binary. I'm working on adding distributed and autoscale functionality as the next layer.\nToday I have search, observability (via prometheus), unlimited message sizes, and the ability to schedule messages arbitrarily in the future.\nIn terms of monetization, the goal is to just have a hosted queue system. I believe this can be cheaper than SQS without sacrificing performance. Just as Backblaze and Minio have had success competing in the S3 space, I wanted to take a crack at queues.\nI'd love your feedback!\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40837610\nPoints: 326\n# Comments: 86",

          "description": "I'm not a genius, nor do I believe I'm the absolute best at what I do.\nIt took me 30 years to realize that, no matter how good I am, networking often determines success. I'm in a career I don't enjoy, unable to move up or change, while others get jobs through connections. About 80% of my colleagues were hired this way, while a few of us got in by luck.\nNetworking seems to drive career advancement.\nI'm naturally a loner and find it hard to feign interest in others' lives. I prefer spending time alone and struggle to genuinely connect with people.\nEmotional intimacy drains me, and I dread future interactions, even though I know this is normal.\nWhile I'm okay being alone, I feel that relationships are crucial for progress after a certain point.\nI even broke up with my partner because I can't handle constant companionship. It was so draining that I stopped enjoying sexual intimacy.\nI'm fine without a partner; I don't want to subject anyone to my solitude. However, I want to change careers, and I know connections are vital.\nI'm feeling stuck and unsure how to move forward. It seems the two crucial factor (luck and networking) are outside my influence.\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40833149\nPoints: 18\n# Comments: 13",

          "description": "Hi HN! I've posted Pickcode a few times (most recently https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38365638), but we've improved things quite a bit so I thought it was worth posting again. This is a bit of 1.0 release after a long year of working on the company full time!\nPickcode is basically Replit-lite, for kids. The editor is simple: text editor + output console + big green button to run your code. We support Python, HTML/CSS/JS, Java, and our block/text hybrid language, Pickcode VL.  We're partners on code.org's Hour of Code, and hundreds of thousands of students have tried our free stuff through them.\nAn account for individual kids is totally free, and we offer some free Python and Pickcode VL lessons to get them started. We make money by selling licenses to schools for better customer support and roster/lesson management features.\nYou can use this demo account I made to try out the editor:\n  email: demo@student.pickcode.io\n  pw: Demo1234\n\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40831904\nPoints: 28\n# Comments: 7",

The best way to get started is with the docs - https://r2r-docs.sciphi.ai/introduction.\nThis is a major update from our V1 which we have spent the last 3 months intensely building after getting a ton of great feedback from our first Show HN (https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39510874). We changed our focus to building a RAG engine instead of a framework, because this is what developers asked for the most. To us this distinction meant working on an opinionated system instead of layers of abstractions over providers. We built features for multimodal data ingestion, hybrid search with reranking, advanced RAG techniques (e.g. HyDE), automatic knowledge graph…",

It crashes sometimes still on mobile devices.\nI wasn't able to take photogrammetry photos of the artifacts from the tomb in the Museo Egizio in Turin because they were traveling while I was there (and now the museum is closed to install a new roof anyhow), so I tried to include comparanda from other museums where I had scanned artifacts.\nI tested the same dataset with 3d Gaussian Splatting but that had lower resolution results for great complexity in frontend code and reduced performance on older devices.

          "description": "After 13 years in SWE, working for startups, bigger companies, the golden handcuffs, etc, I can finally say that I think I'm finished.\nRight now I'm contracting to stay afloat, maintain flexibility and delve into entrepreneurship, but I truly don't know what the future holds for me anymore if building my own company doesn't work out. I have 0 inclination to go back to a 9-5 at a company coding for a living. I'm done. I've been an EM, which might arguably be the most miserable position that exists. I've been senior/staff at places, and honestly I just don't enjoy arguing about the structure of software anymore, I'm tired of the personalities, tired of the infantilization of the industry (frankly, it's embarrassing) but mostly, I just don't enjoy coding as much as I used to, unless I'm leveraging it to create an asymmetrical amount of value for me ($$$$) which is just not what a full time job is.\nHowever, I don't know what to look into as an alternative if I need a full time position once my wife and I start having kids. My strengths revolve around people and strategy. I've been considering sales at a tech company because to me, working harder and having an unlimited cap in what I can earn sounds pretty fantastic.\nWould love to hear any kinds of stories or tips from folks\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40780940\nPoints: 95\n# Comments: 41",

          "description": "Hey HN! I've built this cli tool to manage env variables of a project, but mostly for fun and to try out Rust and the clap crate.\nI had this idea when I made a big mistake and broke some production stuff because I had a very messy .env file laying around in my project.\nI was implementing new features for one of my projects and in my .env file I had the test database url commented out and the production one was not. Long story short, I applied migrations to the production database instead of my local test one and broke a lot of production APIs :')\nI wanted a tool that could easily help me spot these issues before something bad happened, and so I built envelope for that reason.\nInstead of a \\.env(\\..+)? file, I now use this tool to add variables to different configurations: dev, prod etc. and I feed them to the program I am executing on a one liner.\n  $ envelope init\n  $ envelope add dev db_url localhost:5432/postgres\n  $ envelope add dev db_username username\n  $ envelope add dev db_pwd pwd\n  $ export $(envelope list dev)\n  $ ./run.sh\n\nA very useful feature that I use quite a lot is the `check` command which is going to tell you which environment you have currently active\n  $ export $(envelope list dev)\n  $ envelope check\n  > dev\n\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40758703\nPoints: 61\n# Comments: 34",

          "description": "This is the first iteration of a short game I’m making that tries to interactively explain some of my favorite math questions / ideas. My goal is mostly to get the player curious and not necessarily to explain absolutely everything.\nThere were a lot of fun technical parts to building this:\n- For implementation reasons, it’s much easier if the lines all have integer intersection points with each other. To do this, when a new line is added I “cheat” by rounding intersections to integers and then splitting the old lines at the intersection into new linds (with potentially different slopes) going through the rounded point\n- I had to draw semi accurate maps of actual places (UK, South America, US west coast) in the HTML canvas using just line segments. I tried a few different solutions, including using SVG data. I ended up using the topojson library to give nice line approximations to GeoJSON maps\n- I use a simple backtracking algorithm to handle the live coloring of graphs\n- I use turf.js’s polygonize function to handle finding polygons from line segments (very happy I didn’t have to implement this myself!)\n- I wanted to make the game as mobile friendly as possible (don’t think I’ve nailed this quite yet)\nThere were also a few tradeoffs I made:\n- I wanted give links earlier in the game for players to learn more, but I decided to wait until the end to maintain the flow of the game\n- In order to make the game more mobile-friendly, I generally stuck to maps with a small number of regions (at least for maps people have to interact with them). So for the most part all of the instances in the game are “easy”\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40740021\nPoints: 411\n# Comments: 93",

          "description": "This is the third camera I've designed/made around the raspberry pi parts/ecosystem.\nThe repo has all the STL files, parts list, most wiring diagrams. The first one was the custom Pi Zero HQ cam which was featured on a Hackaday article/podcast.\nThe modular version (aside from being able to swap cameras) mostly has the latest software. Recently I added the ability to process videos in the background (ffmpeg merges wav/mp4 files together).\nThe camera uses crop-zoom-panning for dialing in shots with manual lenses. The menu is created by layering images/text with PIL. Live preview is a little slow as it's SPI based.\nIf anybody is a pro at python I'd appreciate insight on better code. I've mostly just followed a context-based folder layout regarding where everything is.\nI have not added custom/manual settings yet, it uses auto settings for the most part except for when you use a V3 camera module (which has electronic aperture) then it uses the d-pad to set the focus/diopter value.\nI have another camera in mind/future build although it's more tailored for videos.\nSome sample video I've shot.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkjXkQD0j9w\nAssembly video\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dXG-MoIw93Q\nAt some point I will rewrite the code for a new general purpose DIY camera software from what I've learned, that'll be an undertaking.\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40730245\nPoints: 34\n# Comments: 15",

          "description": "Hello HN!\nHere's Billard. It combines music and physics into a unique creative tool, as I explore various unconventional methods for generating music.\nMost traditional music composition tools revolve around the idea of a repeatable pattern.\nBillard is a webapp that never repeats itself. It generates music automatically based on the collisions of balls in a 2D space. Collisions trigger notes (or chords) in a given key. One can add balls or move them (y-position is pitch); the app remembers its state between reloads; or it can be reset with the 'init' button on the top left. Gravity can be adjusted in real time to change the behavior of the balls.\nIt owes a lot of inspiration to Brian Eno and Erik Satie (inventor of musique d'ameublement, or \"furniture music\"). Some may think the lack of pattern makes it not musical enough -- but this lets it be listened to —and watched— for a while without boredom.\nThe webapp is made using plain JavaScript. (All SVG icons were made 'by hand'.) It uses Tone.js only for triggering piano samples. Beyond piano, it's MIDI-enabled and works well at slow speed with haunting, dark synth sounds.\nHope you like it!\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40719782\nPoints: 134\n# Comments: 41",

          "description": "In the summer of 1999 I began working on a C++ code generator. When I gave Bjarne Stroustrup a demo of it in 2003, I had a web interface. Eventually I realized that I should develop a command line interface and I was able to start doing so in 2009. For a short time, I had a 2-tier system with the command line front end. It wasn't long before I added a middle tier. Today it's implemented as a 3-tier system where each of the tiers is in C++.\n I started with Red Hat and used Arch and a number of distros until around 2014 when I switched to FreeBSD primarily due to wanting to use the kqueue/kevent API. Then around 2022 I switched back to Linux primarily to be able to use io-uring. My front tier, though, is very portable and also runs on Windows, MacOS, and the BSDs.\n Because my back tier is proprietary, there are some who have not appreciated my work. I'm sorry but making the service available for free is the best I can do. \n It's been a wild ride. Back when I gave Stroustrup a demo I was broke from investing in my company. I was living with a 96-year-old woman with two small dogs she didn't allow outside. Part of my rent was cleaning up after the dogs. Her first name was Constance -- it took me a while to realize that was a great name for a roommate to someone working on a C++ code generator.\n Thanks for reading. Viva la C++.\n    submitted by    /u/Middlewarian  \n [link]   [comments]",

Both GRUB bootloader and Linux live on the same disk (which I have verified with lsblk), Windows on the other. By all logic, this setup should prevent Windows from accidentally overriding the GRUB bootloader with the Windows bootloader. \n However, when I booted into Windows, I saw a loading bar reminiscence of a Windows 7 loading bar. Perhaps it was a large update, but right after this, when I switched my boot order back to GRUB, I was immediately greeted by a rescue shell as GRUB gave me an \"unknown filesystem error\". \n The fix was easy enough using a liveUSB, chroot and grub-install + grub-update, but it left me thinking how I can prevent this from happening to me again. I was also wondering if anyone else has faced this issue, despite also having their Linux and Windows physical boot disk being two separate drives. Did Microsoft make some changes such that Windows even checks other drives now for EFI partitions?\n Also, I know some people might give the meme answer of \"Don't use Windows\", but unfortunately school work requires some really iffy programs that only works on Windows. \n    submitted by    /u/Derpythecate  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "TLDR, can you guys think of any other examples of this?\n So, there's this video editor for Linux called DaVinci Resolve Studio, and although it's available for all three operating systems, the Linux version doesn't support AAC audio. What this effectively means is anything you record on a standard consumer device like a phone or a budget camera or OBS out of the box will have no sound unless you convert it first.\n Why? Well, this is just extrapolation on my part, but I found out that the license holders for AAC demand it be paid on a per-device basis. Even though you can get Windows for free, Windows and Mac can both be assumed to have already paid the licensing fee. With Linux, you can't count on anything like that. Even if they sold a plug-in to add the functionality, you would have to activate it on every computer you installed it on, or they would have to work out a deal where you could buy the codec for Linux itself on every Linux install. This would most likely stop Adobe Premiere from supporting it if it ever got ported to Linux.\n The reason why free programs like Shotcut and kdenlive are able to support it is because they aren't being used for commercial work. I don't understand how myself, but in the DaVinci Resolve subreddit, I found out that Hollywood actually scans your work to make sure that everything was above board, and if you tried using one of these free programs, it would get flagged. And Hollywood's not using AAC audio anyway. Well, outside of the trailers, they post on social media, but that's probably coming from a Mac device instead of a Linux device.\n Anyways, that's one example of how the free and customizable nature of Linux can hamper the functionality of cross-platform software. The functionality of our computers is held hostage by legal BS. Can you think of any other programs that would run into this kind of patent nonsense that would keep it from being able to be ported on Linux?\n    submitted by    /u/Indolent_Bard  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Before using Wayland, I was on X11 with DWM as my window manager. I wanted a similar setup for Wayland. I tried three tiling Wayland compositors, DWL, River, and Hyprland. However, I experienced a lot of issues with all of them. For one, on DWL, you can't change your XKB keyboard layout configuration at runtime. Because of this, I switched to River. However, River, like most Wayland compositors, doesn't give you the ability to disable vsync for certain windows. This is important for games because you want the lowest latency possible. Finally, I switched to Hyprland. Hyprland gives you the ability to disable vsync for fullscreen applications. However, Hyprland is full of bugs. Some Wayland applications don't work on it and screen recording with OBS causes the framerate to dip.\n Ultimately, the fact is that there isn't one option that is free of major bugs and has all the features I want. There's just less variety on Wayland than X11 at the moment. In addition to that, I don't like Wayland's philosophy. It wants to force compositors to be a certain way. Basic things like using keybinds for OBS become difficult as a result. What if I want to disable vsync for the entire compositor? What if I want to not have a compositor altogether and just use a window manager? This is just not possible on Wayland. I don't like the fact that X11 will be obsoleted in favour of a restrictive protocol.\n    submitted by    /u/SaltyMaybe7887  \n [link]   [comments]",

I'm just gonna share here what I did just in case someone goes through this again and hopefully it helps\n First getting some maybe relevant stuff out of the way,\n  \nOS: Ubuntu 24.04 with kernel `6.8.0-38-generic`. \n CPU: Intel i5-12600k\n Mobo: Gigabyte B760I DDR4\n GPU: Gigabyte RTX 4060\n  \nDriver Choice\n I ended up with nvidia-535 cuz nvidia-550 caused so much flickering that it was not usable. And I can't get x11 to work on either of them (crashes once I open any app) so wayland it is.\n Fixing GL Rendering\n Benchmarks and video games got always stuck on a black screen right after I opened them up, sudo apt install libnvidia-egl-wayland1 seems to fix this.\n Fixing Broken Black Screen After Sleep Resume\n Putting the system to sleep and then resuming, caused the screen to go black except the parts that were getting redrawn. The fix to that was to tweak some modprobes\n $ sudo vim /etc/modprobe.d/nvidia.conf # and add the following options nvidia-drm fbdev=1 options nvidia NVreg_PreserveVideoMemoryAllocations=1 \n Followed by\n $ sudo update-initramfs -u $ sudo reboot \n There is still some slight lagging on Chrome after resuming from sleep, but I can work with that a bit for now\n Refs:\n  \nhttps://wiki.hyprland.org/Nvidia/\n https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/NVIDIA/Tips_and_tricks#Preserve_video_memory_after_suspend\n https://download.nvidia.com/XFree86/Linux-x86_64/435.17/README/powermanagement.html\n https://www.reddit.com/r/hyprland/comments/1b5f11n/solved_nvidia_suspend_wakeup_fix/\n  \n   submitted by    /u/aeahmg  \n [link]   [comments]",

Ive noticed though all the issues i have had are soely because its not supported.\n My gaming performance is usually worse when using proton, however if games were just native it would be fine. I get small amounts of input lag so i cant play competitive games properly. This is likely caused by proton which exists because theres no support. Wayland provides worse performance and more input lag on my nvidia gpu because nvidia doesnt work great with it, but the alternative x11 doesnt work great with 2 monitors of different refresh rates.\n My rgb software and afterburner just dont work. Hdr isnt supported. Most anti cheats dont work. I had weird issues installing davinchi resolve, and once i had it was buggy.\n Theres little fault of the operating system itself and its literally just because nobody cares to support something only 4% of people use. If i want an experience without loads of troubleshooting every time i install something, im basically forced to use windows. I think windows is clearly inferior in every way. Just the support it gets keeps is on top.\n Kind of sad. The linux community and valve have done so much to make it better, but it cant be a viable replacement for windows for many people because companies wont make apps for it.\n    submitted by    /u/No-Drawing-1508  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hi everyone, this is my first time posting here. I want to share my personal experience installing with a computer that I bought and brought Ubuntu 20.04 as it's OS.\n I started the computer, and everything went ok. Then Ubuntu obviously said to me that I required some important updates and I did agree.\n After Ubuntu updated and the reboot, then I was not able to boot the OS. So knowing a bit of how linux can be sometimes I decided to read online if this was a problem with GRUB settings, and of course it was. I set \"nomodeset\" and then I was able to boot again. \n Next issue was that I was not able to change my brightness, I took some hs looking for similar problems people faced and the only solution that worked for me was installing a soft fake brightness app that emulates the brightness controll quite well for being not a proper solution.\n I was \"okay, now I can finally open vim, put some music with cmus and start working\", and then for course when I plugged my headset I had no sound, and I had to modify the rate sample at /etc/pulse/daemon.conf in order to make it work.\n So basically it was a \"You have the OS but now you need to fix some driver / configuration issues in order to use it\".\n And no, this is not a rant saying that linux is bad or that Ubuntu sucks, it just a shared experience and I realized that if I had to spent a whole day to make my laptop functional, I cannot imagine what a nightmare could be for a user without any experience in linux (mine is minimal though).\n    submitted by    /u/Strad3x  \n [link]   [comments]",

A couple of questions:\n  \nHow many monitors do you use?\n How are they laid out?\n What DE/WM are you using?\n How do you organize your virtual desktops?\n  \nI'll start:\n  \nNumber of monitors: 2\n Layout: One 27-inch primary monitor in front and one 17-inch secondary monitor (laptop) to the left\n DE/WM: i3wm\n Virtual desktops: I manage virtual desktops with keyboard hotkeys, all the even workspaces are on my primary monitor, all the odd workspaces on the secondary.\n  \nAlso, a couple more productivity-related questions that aren't necessarily about monitors: - What works best for you? - How have you optimized your setup for productivity? - Any tips or tricks that you'd also like to share?\n Thanks for reading!\n    submitted by    /u/DatCodeMania  \n [link]   [comments]",

I used the raspberry pi to make a bootable usb drive of Debian and I never looked back :) that was probably one of the best things to ever happen to me to be completely honest, it unlocked a whole new world of possibilities. Got me into cybersecurity, foss, and programming, and out of vendor lock and ngl completely changed how i view and use technology.\n I would love to hear your guys reasoning why you ended up here and how its impacted you :)\n    submitted by    /u/Viciousvitt  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "One type of criticism I've seen levied on these videos is that YouTubers have specific needs that aren't really met by Linux. However, to me, these videos actually demonstrate how Linux is about as useful as a Chromebook for most professionals. Now that gaming is mostly solved, we really need to figure out the professional software situation on Linux.\n The other issue is that people who have invested thousands of dollars into their hobbies can't switch without effectively throwing all that money away, which is a real shame because I can't really argue against that. It's one thing to set up your workflow with Linux as a beginner, but if you've already spent thousands of dollars on plugins for Adobe or VSTs for Windows, then switching becomes a lot less tempting even if you really want to.\n Finally, one thing I've noticed is that it doesn't seem like it's the software itself that's the problem, but it's mostly the proprietary DRM they use. Maybe Valve, or Futo, or some other company with an incentive to push Linux for consumers, could works with companies like Adobe to get their software working through wine, much like Proton did for gaming. That way, their efforts are being funded by every customer rather than just the 3% of Linux users. However, this still adds a layer of uncertainty, as an update may or may not end up completely breaking that functionality. Working professionals might not be comfortable with that.\n    submitted by    /u/Indolent_Bard  \n [link]   [comments]",

Have heard of past scholars leaving Linux. Any tips to stick on? Wine doesn't solve the problem in the long run since none of the new installers work and there are no official installers for the older version. I'll give an update after receiving all your suggestions. This community(in general, along with the whole open source ecosystem) is the reason for my research motivation but now that I'm in a catch 22 situation, I would like ideas from those who were in similar situations, whether in corporate environments or in B-schools. Maybe resources from those who have gone through the same situation would be helpful as well.\n Edit: some clarifications\n I already dual boot and it's not like I never use windows, but when softwares like excel have some compatibility issue on Linux, it makes small edits on Linux impossible.

          "description": "After seeing 100's of \"switch to Linux\" posts over the past year, I think I will offer a solution by simply pointing out the false dilemma that is self-imposed by the askers.\n Should you switch to Linux? Should you dual-boot Linux? Are you worried about corrupting systems? Are you afraid of making the move to Linux?\n You can try this which will be far less scary or painful, keep your Windows or whatever system you use, and buy a used laptop off eBay to install Linux on. This way you get the best of both worlds without risk.\n You now do not need to worry about anything going wrong, you do not need to worry about transferring data or losing important files. No complications of dual booting, if you later decide Linux isn't for you then you still have your old Mac or Windows desktop/laptop. \n Just because you want to experience or use Linux, this doesn't have to be an all or nothing switch. Many people (myself included) happily use Linux and Windows.\n The great thing about Linux (especially lightweight DE's like XFCE) is that Linux runs snappy and crisp on older hardware. So don't think of it as \"I have to sell my old boots to buy a new pair of boots\" You can keep your old comfortable boots, buy a new pair, and wear both.\n    submitted by    /u/Lux_JoeStar  \n [link]   [comments]",

Not without reason seems really popular.\n And at the end this, no I don't comeback to Windows, I don't want to change to another distro, Arch especially with Gnome looks and works really well, I did want to make chance to KDE, but KDE in default looks too similar to Windows for me.\n So yeah it was a hard, but I already really love Linux.

          "description": "Was using Windows since I was 12 but about a month ago switched to daily driving kubuntu due to me being worried about what Windows was doing with my data (still have it dual boot cause SATs consider Linux cheating but rarely ever boot into it). \n I never really \"liked\" the experience of Windows tbh, the OS just felt confusing to me even after using it for many years. For example: I can right click to eject a USB stick but have to go to another menu to eject SSD's on Windows. Also so many ads even after just a fresh install. When I used Win10, I saw some candy crush ads on the start menu and Win11 had a ton of app promotions on it. Kubuntu as none of that. I didn't think stock Windows was that pretty and had to manually change each individual icon to make it look good. Customizing Windows was such a pain to do and I always felt more distracted than productive on it.\n But kubuntu, everything somehow feels easier than Windows. Customizing it is so easy and doesn't even require the command line to do so (unless it's more complex stuff like installing a dock). I can install widgets, change my icons, customize my cursor: all this in a streamlined menu. The middle click paste feature, albeit annoying at first, was such a game changer for coding. I feel so much more productive with it because things can get done faster. And all my drives can be ejected with right click instead of 2 different ways for each type. And Dolphin is such a great file manager and makes way more sense than whatever Windows has.\n My PC looks and feels the way I like it and makes me want to use it to get things done: this is how it should be! Before, I wanted to use Mac or wished iPads were powerful enough to code on and only used my pc when there wasn't a mobile option for certain tasks but now I'm happy with my laptop.

I switched because I just couldn't work with Windows anymore. Ads everywhere, they shove that stupid onedrive thing in my face every time I turn on my computer. Slow and unreliable. To be honest, even though there are a lot of problems with Linux, there hasn't been a day I regretted switching. One of the problems is using Linux with an Nvidia GPU.

Next, I installed Blender and it could use the RTX 3080 without further configuration. So far, so good.\n I was happy to see that Ubuntu still gives us the deb version of Gnome Extensions Manager. Several distros force a ~500 MB flatpak for just that which, for me, is a NO NO. Gimp and several other programs that I need are also still available as a non-snap version. YAY, more room for LLMs and SD models.\n Next, I installed the Battery Health Charging Gnome extension which worked as expected. I then moved the dock to the bottom, centred it and tweaked several Gnome settings.\n For me, 24.04 had problems shutting down and I am happy to say that this seems to be no longer an issue.

Konsave also lets you share your dot files to your friends in an instant! It officially supports KDE Plasma but it can be used on all other desktop environments too!\n From ME:\n I can't tell you how many times I jacked up my theme, editing my screen, applets, task manager, etc. Spend another 30-minutes trying to get back whatever it was I just screwed up. Well, those days are gone. If you haven't heard there's a nifty python program called konsave that can save your current \"theme\". There's several ways to install it, the konsave website tells you to use python -m pip install konsave to install it. That may work for you. For me on OpenSUSE I had to install python311-pipx using zypper then use the pipx tool (zypper in python311-pipx) to install Konsave. It's usage was the same: pipx install konsave.\n Once you install konsave you can save your current theme information, not just the theme but all the apps, icon locations, icons, cursors, sddm, wallpaper, all of the things that you have customized. Then you can mess around with new theme styles and if you realize you liked the old one better just konsave -a old-saved-theme and get back to where you were.\n Of note you need to be your desktop user, don't use su or sudo.\n If you knew about this, AWESOME. I didn't, and spent the last year without this wonderful tool!\n    submitted by    /u/CryGeneral9999  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hey all! This is my first time posting here, but I've come and gone from the Linux world for a long time. Primarily, I'm a Mac user, but I've always kept Windows around as a compatibility option, and I even dual booted my gaming rig with Ubuntu back in the mid to late 2010s. Well more recently, I've had to switch to Mac more exclusively since a lot of the software I'm most comfortable with for my creative pursuits (podcasting, video editing, etc.) is Mac only (I know there are alternatives to Garageband and iMovie, but they're what my brain likes, and I've learned not to fight that lest I spend more time fighting with new software than creating). I've also been really dismayed by Microsoft's bullshittery these days re: AI and privacy and security. So with an eye to getting away from Windows wherever I can, I decided to dust off my old 2012 Mac Mini, wipe it, and install Ubuntu 24.04 LTS instead. I've then set it up so that its hooked up side by side my M1 Mac Mini on a different HDMI port, with easily swappable peripherals between them. The end result is having both my Mac, and a Linux machine at my disposal whenever needed. This allows me to spend most of my time in macOS, while also being able to easily switch to Ubuntu for gaming of a certain older vintage thanks to the excellent work Valve has done with Proton in Steam. All in all, I'm really impressed with my new setup, and how Linux has basically totally revived and breathed new life into this aging 2012 i5 Mini.\n I present to you, the setup I've affectionately taken to calling the MacStac!\n https://preview.redd.it/cu9e4okdax9d1.jpg?width=2783&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=4ae86322d14ce3da700e1e6d66c059a77fb37511\n    submitted by    /u/Merdy1337  \n [link]   [comments]",

I think that works fine (I can't be sure until I have a crash and have to restore my system :-) ). Now, on mac you have TimeMachine, with which you can browse previous versions of files and folders. I would also like that feature in a back-up system. Pika is a backup solution that works with BorgBase. Would that give such ability in some way? Or what is a good solution for this (preferably without having to pay for yet another service).

I have my A+ and Sec+ so there was some familiarity with these topics. There was a post on this community that said it’s a good test to take for broadening understanding of various OSs and computers in general.\n My background is predominantly military and emergency services. \n Hopefully this post helps other people on the fence with taking it. Here’s what I did to pass: \n -Printed off the exam objectives from comp tia. \n -made a 3x5 flashcard for every topic using GPT4 to define the topics and relate the topics to windows OS. I made over 600 flashcards this week. ($20)\n -Used an app called IT security to drill questions. It gave me a question deck of 500 questions I paid for this service and answered all 500 questions. ($20)\n I had a raspberry pi as my Linux computer that I would run commands through and learn how the commands work. ($100)\n I can say that I will never use Linux at work since I work in an environment that will never leave windows OS. My understanding of OSs (even windows) is better now and I’m really glad I took this cert. \n    submitted by    /u/Amilliontoads  \n [link]   [comments]",

It is useful because efibootmgr is rather intimidating/annoying to use with very ugly looking output, IMHO. Particularly, if you are a distro hopper, efibootdude aims to help you clean up the mess.\n efibootdude is feature-wise comparable to Elinvention/efiboots: Manage EFI boot loader entries with this simple GUI. But eftbootdude is easier to install (if not in your distro's repo), is more transparent about what it is doing, and tries to report the mount point or device path of each boot loader (to make clean-up easier).\n To try if you wish ... install efibootmgr (if needed), pipx (if needed), and finally run pipx install efibootdude to install. And then run efibootdude with no arguments generally. It looks like this:\n efibootdude v0.5 screenshot\n efibootdude runs well on the systems I've tried (using python11 and python12), but there are a lot of weird BIOSes out there ;-) But, if not working so well for you, create an issue, say, provide the \"raw\" output of efibootmgr, your motherboard/BIOS, and a problem description so I can either generalize or add your case to the caveats ;-) Cheers.\n    submitted by    /u/ZetaZoid  \n [link]   [comments]",

I hope it's not too out of place.\n My dad was a huge linux geek(and computer fan in general) in the early days that it came out. It was his passion in life that he made into a successful career. So much so that while other fathers and sons were playing catch, he was showing me how to use Linux and Unix. I have many great memories of me and him bonding in front of a bash shell. I remember him telling everyone he saw(regardless of if they knew about linux or not) and acting like the proudest father alive when he taught me something as easy as how to cd into a directory when I was 6.\n I remember him religiously collecting stuffed penguins to add to his computer desk. There was a point where he had 10 scattered around and my mom complained that the work area was more penguin than desk. He was a goofy guy who managed to transfer his passions to me.\n Unfortunately, He got diagnosed with an early and aggressive form of dementia(frontotemporal) and ended up not being able to use computers anymore. He's been declining for years now and I've seen him go from the smartest person I've ever known to having the brain capacity of a newborn. He entered hospice two days ago and isn't expected to last much longer. Even through all of the deterioration, He still loves his stuffed penguin and has to have it near.\n I wanted to thank the community for always indulging him and sharing his same passion. This community was always the one that was the kindest to the goofy and eccentric guy who was my father. Truth be told, I can't even look at Linux right now without breaking down. I will in time though.\n    submitted by    /u/MyceliumJoe  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "It's been my experience that \"Terminal Emulators\" such as 'xterm', 'konsole', 'GNOME Terminal' and the like are graphical emulators of old Teletype and early screen-based interfaces.\n Without installing a GUI -- such as on a generic multiuser server -- the text-based interface is hard-coded into the box: plug in a monitor, and the text-based BIOS or UEFI interface works automagically. The hardware is simply a modern descendant of workstation terminals. It is, for all intents and purposes, a \"terminal\".\n A younger friend insists that this hardware interface is an emulator using graphics and such, and the 'command line program' is a separate application of its own… Did I miss something? Are they teaching something new about hardware that I've missed in the past 40 or so years?\n    submitted by    /u/sjbluebirds  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "This week, we lost one of the great minds of our generation. Daniel dedicated the last 14 years of his life to creating an academic model for real-time threading. This work eventually led to the Linux Kernel runtime verification (RV), providing a practical use case for these models. He authored RTLA (Realtime Latency Analysis tool) that provides analysis of real-time performance and debugging based on models generated from RV. This marked a revolutionary approach to kernel debugging that relied on BPF and tracers to build live models of the current system state, as opposed to the historical method of black-box statically generated system states (i.e., kernel dumps and trace-cmd). \n While his work focused on real-time models, RV's reach expanded to general models of the stock Linux kernel (PREEMPT RT disabled) and successfully replaced tools like trace-cmd and, in some use cases, kdump. Today, I want to not only mourn the kernel legend that he had become but also the man himself. I had the honor of working with him, and the joy he brought into each and every room cannot be overstated. He blended a unique combination of compassion and genius that is rarely seen in the field of computer science, particularly at the level he reached. I will forever miss our casual fireside chats, our light-hearted debates about the best Prosecco drinks, and much, much more. RIP Daniel, you will be deeply missed by everyone in the community.\n    submitted by    /u/bootlesscrowfairy  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "We're all familiar with the use of 'dd' to write installers, the good old\n sudo dd if=installer.img of=/dev/sda2 bs=1M status=progress \n dance. It works, but it's not great:\n  \nThe progress info doesn't show progress as a percentage, nor does it calculate an ETA, it just shows bytes written.\n dd's default block size is a bad fit for most modern systems, hence the bs= parameter.\n It's easy to forget status=progress, and including it every time is a bit annoying.\n  \nNow, dd doesn't do anything special: it just reads from one file and writes to another. Tools like pv and cat could do the exact same thing. The only reason people really use dd for this purpose is that you can run dd as root, whereas redirecting the output of cat or pv requires running the shell itself as root. sudo dd ... is more terse than sudo sh -c 'cat ...'.\n A few weeks ago, I got annoyed with dd and implemented a --output option to the excellent tool called pv (\"Pipe Viewer\"). This meant that I could write images using sudo pv -o /dev/sda2 ... instead of using dd.\n Well, a week ago, PV released version 1.8.10 which contains my --output feature! Once your distribution updates to the latest version, you too can use pv instead of dd. Here are some advantages:\n  \npv shows an actual progress bar and an ETA, rather than just bytes written.\n pv automatically detects optimal buffer sizes.\n pv is more terse, since there is no need to specify status=progress or bs=....\n  \nTo ue pv instead of dd, simply run:\n sudo pv installer.img -Yo /path/to/block/device \n (The -Y is useful because it causes pv to sync after every write. This avoids the issue where the transfer hangs for a long time at 100% as buffers are flushed to the drive. -Yo is a nice mnemonic to remember :))\n Screenshot\n    submitted by    /u/mort96  \n [link]   [comments]",

Though, I admit things are getting better and hopefully 560 will be a big step in the right direction. Due to this frustration, I decided I would try to do something about it which led me down the rabbit hole of hybrid graphics.\n Traditionally, hybrid graphics is used on laptops for power-saving reasons. The laptop uses the iGPU for lightweight workloads and offloads to the dGPU when necessary. That said, there's no reason why we shouldn't be able to do the same on desktop.\n After about 3 hours of trial and error, bios tweaking, driver installation, tinkering with /etc/environment and /etc/profile and even tweaking some kernel modules, I succeeded.

The 'regular' fs options like ext4/xfs lack this feature. (f2fs has compression but its disabled and you won't see any space saved)\n There should be no technical reason why something as simple as compression should be tied to CoW/snapshot capability. Its simply (de)compressing data as its written/read. e.g. NTFS on Windows does this.\n Is there a reason for this apart from historical? e.g etx4 and xfs are both quite old - xfs predates Linux in fact. Perhaps no one has felt the need to add this feature to them because alternatives exist?\n This is a real shame because with modern cpus and lzo/zstd, compression can make a real difference not only in space saved but ssd/hdd health, and there's no way to use it with the most used default fs on desktop (ext4) or server (xfs).\n    submitted by    /u/ECrispy  \n [link]   [comments]",

I haven't really done a careful research in order to choose a distro, I just found Ubuntu Budgie and flashed into my desktop PC. I was really surprised, I expected Linux to be overwhelming and complicated, but it really wasn't, and in fact I have more fun using Linux than Windows 11.\n Then I went to  and I tried to rice my poor Budgie and I ended up making up a mess. But no problem I didn't have important files or sensitive data, so in order to fix everything I went on another distro, Xubuntu.\n I have been using Xubuntu since the 3rd of June, and so far I've been enjoying it, I noticed that I'm relying less and less on the file explorer and more on the terminal, I love using the terminal.\n A distro that caught my eye btw, was Arch. Not only because you can rice endlessly and customize how you want, but because I like seeing people using it. It looks minimalistic, simple and efficient. I also did some research on the AUR and how it keeps packages up to date better than APT on ubuntu.\n I also heard that using Arch will teach you how an OS works more in-depth, and since computer science interests me I think it would be a good source of learning.\n With that said I want to clarify what do I use and what is my purpose :\n I have 12GB of RAM, AMD RX 580, I use my PC mainly for browsing, productive work such as programming, taking notes, coding etc... I do little to no gaming and I'm really curious about learning new stuff in the OS, GNU/Linux world.\n Tell what should I know before installing Arch, advices , tips, feel free to interact and thanks in advance !\n    submitted by    /u/DonCABASH  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I've always loved Linux. Even before I fully switched, I was largely using Debian in WSL. Since I have switched though, I've heard a concerning large amount of people complain that whenever they post a question on a forum, particularly about arch btw, they tend to get answers telling them to read the f*cking manual. I find this interesting, because I actually disagree that this is a problem - if anything I would say it's a good thing. The issue is, new Linux users often post questions about common problems before even spending more than a minute searching Google, which causes a huge amount of duplicate posts all asking the same question, when they could have already found a number of people with the same issue online. This significantly brings down the quality of these forums, especially when many distributions have some truly amazing documentation - but for what, if nobody reads it? I think it's perfectly fine to ask something online on a forum, but only if you've first actually tried solving it yourself actively for more than 10 minutes.\n Change my view.\n (i use arch btw)\n EDIT: Typo fix\n    submitted by    /u/JakeStBu  \n [link]   [comments]",

It's therefore possible to get the latest upstream release even if you're on, let's say, Debian Ancient Stable.\n On top of that, even \"LTS\" releases of non-rolling distros provide up-to-date kernels these days. Ubuntu, for example, provides their hardware enablement stack, which is enabled by default, meaning that even if you stick with an LTS release you still get the latest kernel every 6 months when the non-LTS release does their kernel freeze.\n What, then, remains for the rolling distros from the perspective of the consumer-user?

Removing background noise from my mic based on a noise profile, it's so perfect, it works so perfectly! https://github.com/lucianodato/noise-repellent\n It is basically a replacement to reafir substract mode. It can get your noise profile, which should just be background noise, and remove it.\n I find this to be a lot more straightforward to do on Windows, for now, at least based on the way I do it currently. On Linux, Carla can look overwhelming, it was actually easier and faster to me but it does look much worse.\n Anyways, an amazing Linux win here. Only problem? Not a single tutorial tells you about this. Not a single source. I figured this out on my own, I mean google told me about noise repellent (prompt: linux reafir) but I figured out on my own that this confusing tutorial on reaplugs on linux I saw a thousand years ago used carla and I said \"maybe Carla helps\" without knowing a single thing about it, and I figured it out from there. Easyeffects also helped because their plugin showed up in Carla and I used it as guidance.\n Loving noise repellent. Wonderful work, and I guess it's smarter because it prefers to reduce noise instead of completely remove it (you can still remove it). I don't know if that's smarter.\n IMPORTANT: If you use Carla and maybe Ardour, your noise profile won't be saved. You need to build it yourself and merge pull request #119. Also, if you break easyeffects like I did, just reset the settings. Also, maybe keep a clean profile of carla saved in case you break something\n I hope there is an easier way to implement this, if not now in the future. Currently, I can't find it if I tell google \"linux remove background noise\", it only tells me of RNNoise and alternatives which work so badly in my case I rather not use it\n    submitted by    /u/patopansir  \n [link]   [comments]",

For testing purposes I created a couple of addresses and also used different clients, among them the preinstalled Outlook client in Win11.\n Looking through the logs of my mail server I observed that some IP addresses periodically (about every 30 minutes each account) log in to my mail accounts (which I also used with the Outlook client). The strange thing is, even if my PC was turned off those IPs logged in and fetched mails from the inbox.\n Here is a small extract of the logs showing the relevant lines:\n Jun 15 03:54:28 mail dovecot: imap-login: Login: user=<#mail2#…",

If anyone is aware of such a program, I'd appreciate the recommendation.\n \nOLED care software for laptops: This isn't a dealbreaker, but it would be a nice quality-of-life feature to have software that can dim static elements or shift the screen image to prevent burn-in on OLED laptop displays (in my case a Asus Vivobook).\n \n Despite these concerns, I'm still excited about the prospect of using Linux as my primary operating system, and I hope the community continues to address these issues. If anyone has insights or solutions to the points I've raised, I'd love to hear them.\n Furthermore, I'd love to hear what aspects of Linux are lacking for your usecase.\n Wishing you all a wonderful day!\n    submitted by    /u/Execute_Gaming  \n [link]   [comments]",

Many times basic apps aren't available for particular distro like I couldn't find a working app for wordpress installer like local-wp. Many times application doesn't show up in menu themselves after installation, you need to make them executable, create desktop files . So am I doing something in wrong way ?

          "description": "Just wanted to share that I've been working hard on the latest update for my Android game Dungeon Hero. This update adds an infinite scaling mode to the game after players have won their first run through a dungeon. After completing a run, you'll unlock Tier 2 where you'll face new enemies, and all existing enemies will be more challenging. Completing a run on Tier 2 will unlock Tier 3, and so on - There are infinite tiers, and they get harder and harder. Starting with Tier 2 you can face the true final boss, and attempt to unlock other secrets & areas. There is a lot more coming, so grab your Sword, Bow, or Wand and head into the Dungeon!\n Can check out Dungeon Hero here if curious!

          "description": "I've been in the Samsung Android ecosystem for some time, but I'm tired of Samsung Galaxy not having the ability to have more than one profile on a phone (though they're fine with doing that on their tablets?).\n I want the ability to have a separate work and personal profile, but that's just not possible on any Samsung Galaxy phone.\n I don't want to leave the Samsung ecosystem since I enjoy their products (and I have a Samsung watch and ear buds), but it really doesn't look like adding multiple profile options is something they're going to do.\n But it seems that Samsung Galaxy seems to have the best camera for an Android phone, so I think I'm going to have to choose which one I want more. Having a good camera is also fairly important.\n That being said, it really seems that my only options are either Pixel or OnePlus. Any thoughts? Especially from people who have used the latest models for Galaxy, Pixel, and OnePlus? Or other Android phones I may not have considered?\n Thanks!\n    submitted by    /u/DudeGreen  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hi, I updated my Pixel 8 Pro to the 5/06/24 update of android 14. However when I did this, my SIM card was no longer being read. I am on Three UK and the anywhere in the settings where the SIM card was mentioned or network was mentioned was greyed out. I tried a bunch of solutions.\n This included:\n  \nRestarting the device multiple times\n Resetting the network settings\n Turning the device off for the day (I thought it might have been an overheating issue)\n  \nNothing worked, so I decided to flash the device with Googles browser flashing service. I tried the other latest build, AP2A.240605.024.A1, but I had the same issue. I almost gave up but then I thought to try the previous Android14 build that was on the 8 Pro, AP1A.240505.005.B1. This worked! I can use my network again on my Pixel 8 Pro. I will raise this as a bug with Android. I thought to post here also just in case other people were having the same issue.

          "description": "最近上海的天似乎是裂开了，雨一阵一阵的下，不是那种缠缠绵绵的细雨，是中雨，大雨，狂风暴雨。\n晴天，在天快黑的时候，天空会出现一大片的克莱因蓝，整个天际都被它笼罩着，像披了一层薄薄的纱，又像是裹了一层厚厚的布。这层蓝色掉落凡间，成为了精美的工艺品。有时候调色盘打翻了，会出现粉红的晚霞，一大片一大片的，天空也有少女心，它的娇羞展露无疑。随着夜幕完全降临，黑暗笼罩着一切，这蓝色才依依不舍的离开。\n有句歌词叫做，爱就像蓝天白云，晴空万里，忽然暴风雨，但是今天这场雨蓄谋已久。\n先是乌云。抬头不见蔚蓝的天空，只有大片大片的乌云，乌云们比较沉默，它们只是成团成团的聚在一起，走在跨铁路的天桥上，脚下的火车刚刚驶出车站，正在提速，远处的高楼巍峨的矗立在那里，但乌云毫无畏惧，不断地吸收，不断地膨胀自己，黑云压城城欲摧，当你凝视乌云的时候，乌云也在凝视你，大有吞噬一切的决心。\n然后是闪电。似乎是乌云的铺垫已经足够，是时候来点猛的了，一道闪电划破长空，把乌云笼罩的天空撕开了口子， 闪电是粉红色的，它华丽，它迅猛，它快捷，等你反应过来的时候，它已经完成了它的出场秀，直接隐遁起来。它是一条漂亮且暴躁的蛟龙，谁都别想阻拦它的脚步，房屋阻拦它，房屋损毁，碰到人阻拦，人首分离，它的眼里只有毁灭，毁灭，毁灭。这么强悍的闪电只有一个敌人，避雷针。避雷针太了解它了，把能量都吸走，把力量都卸去，还能奈我何？也许是多次吃过这个亏，闪电们不再单打独斗，而是群体出击，一道又一道的闪电接踵而至，依次划破天空，他们准备释放些什么。\n接着是打雷。视觉上的刺激还不够，还有最后一道铺垫，闪电蛟龙离开之后，立刻来了一道擂鼓助威。先是剧烈的轰的一下，整个城区都石破天惊，一下子把人们的注意力都吸走，然后是急促的咚咚咚咚咚的擂鼓，这鼓声沉闷而又有力量，所有听到这鼓声的人精神为之一振。这边的鼓声渐渐变小，直到消失，人们终于可以叹口气，休息一下了，突然又从另外一个方向再次来一道雷声，再次震撼人的听觉，摧毁人的神经。在一遍又一遍的雷声过后，人们心里的防线终于彻底崩塌：快点下雨吧，快点下雨吧，这种听觉实在让人备受折磨。\n冲锋的号角已经吹起，无数颗雨滴化身成为千军万马，哗啦啦直接从刚才闪电撕开的口子降落而下，它们犹如一股洪流，锐不可挡，一鼓作气，直接从万里高空直冲而下，像是铁板一块，坚不可摧，快要降落到地面的时候，却又改变阵型，各自有各自明确的分工。有的雨滴冲向高楼，有的雨滴冲向人群。有些雨滴在高楼坚硬的外表下猛烈的撞击了一下，蹦出一朵美丽的花，然后又继续向下游走，有些雨专挑路上落单的行人下手，把头发打湿，把衣服打湿，嘲笑着他们在雨中的窘迫，只有那些认真打伞，全副武装的人，它们才无可奈何。\n我坐在窗边，看着窗外滂沱大雨，忍不住的在发呆。作为一个小沪漂，以前很不喜欢宅在家里，呆在这个小空间里，觉得压抑，难受，周末总是会给自己找个理由多出去走走，现在年纪大了，什么都反着来了，越来越喜欢待在家里了，尤其是这种大风大雨的时候，越发的觉得心里很安心，很平静。\n写在一个下暴雨的傍晚。",

          "description": "我有一笔房贷，一共是 127 万元，是 2020 年 3 月份开始贷款的，选的等额本金，30 年。（后续的公积金部分都没算，不打算提前还公积金的 1700 元）当时每个月商贷还 7500 元，随着贷款利率的调整，也就是 LPR 的调整，目前 2024 年 7 月份，每个月只还 6400 元。我之前一共贷款 127 万元，在 2022 年 5 月的时候提前还款了 20 万元，当时选的减年限，所以还款到 2041 年就结束。目前银行的贷款利率是 3.95%。我现在可以去借一个 2.95%的消费贷，来提前还我的房贷贷款 50 万元吗？这样做划算吗？\n大概算了下 3 年的消费贷的话。3 年需要还 32000 元。每个月要还 14000 左右，加上房贷的话，每个月就是 20500 元\n从今年 4 月份开始我发现我的房贷本金还 3200 ，利息还 3200 左右。所以相当于现在我每个月开始本金比利息还的更多了。\n这笔经济账我已经算不清楚了。我本身的倾向就有提前还款的趋势，但是又在犹豫国家大放水的问题。\n注：不用考虑主要工作风险问题，目前我没有做投资的打算，因为最近用了一笔比较大的开销，目前我手上 0 存款。不用考虑每个月我是否还不上的问题。",

          "description": "说个很残酷的事，就是软件行业劳动力过剩还在加剧。这个趋势要持续到什么时候呢，从两个角度观察：\n首先是对风口的迷信。AI 是现在的风口，你们觉得它好用吗，有人用吗？就算有人用，但这么高的成本，有望盈利吗？就算有望盈利，这点钱能撑到那时候吗？就算能撑到那时候，面对新入局竞争者能保持优势吗？难道拿提示词申请专利？\n我想说的是，未来软件风口行业可能会非常不稳定，市场小，企业存活期短，这是大形势决定的。\n其次是创业者越来越多的从自建研发部门转为找外包公司做。我没有确切数字，只是所见所感。很多小平台没什么技术门槛，创业者更关注的是业务模式可行性，花小几万块，先把服务上线看看，做不下去损失也不大。所以别瞧不起外包，外包市场依然有持续的增长空间。只不过互联网创业不再如以前那样明显带来用人需求了。\n综上所述，软件业的劳动力过剩还会加剧，还会继续出清。哪些人呢？一是被培训机构忽悠进来的，报班前告诉你薪水过万，学完出来结果不但就业率低，大部分收入都达不到个税起征点。人家 985211 科班出身的，就业率都那个吊样，你指望啥呢？二是大厂拧螺丝的，你真以为几万的月薪全靠你的本事？你一个月薪水够人家外包公司上线一个新平台，你能做啥，写三条 SQL ？一旦大厂裁掉这些拧螺丝的，他们几乎只能离开行业。\n最后，我没有任何建设性意见。如今提建设性意见容易审核不通过。",

          "description": "上面第一个是目前家里网络的布局。光猫接交换机接主路由，然后子路由有线中继模式，电视 IPTV 直接接光猫，另外有一个不同品牌的路由 B 给较远的房间单独使用。\n但是这样有几个问题：\n1.IPTV 只能用光猫的百兆口。\n2.不确定是不是光猫能力的问题，千兆网络最多只能跑到 500 兆左右，所以想将光猫改桥接模式。\n所以我就画了图中第二个方案，将光猫改成桥接模式，由主路由拨号，然后 IPTV 也直接连接主路由，不知道这个方案可不可行？有以下疑问点：\n1.光猫改成桥接不直接路由，而是接了一层交换机，子路由和主路由都接着这个交换机，会不会影响 mesh ？以我看别人的方案大多数是，光猫-主路由-交换机-子路由。而我的顺序是光猫-交换机-同时接主路由子路由。\n2.之前是路由 A 和路由 B 都接交换机，可以形成两个不同的网络 wifi 。现在如果路由 A 进行拨号，路由 B 还能成功运行吗？\n感谢佬们指教，小白配网还在学习~",

          "description": "支付历史十多年的美区账号。之前从来没有遇到过类似的情况，无论是用 Balance 支付还是信用卡支付，都一直很正常，直到这次。\n话说用 Android 手机，我最离不开的神器之一，是一个叫 AppDialer 的 App 。这个 App 是买了最初的版本，价格不菲，隐约记得好像 10+USD ，但一直使用了好几年，也算值了。后面因为 Android 系统限制，导致 Widget 的有些功能不能正常使用了，dev 升级后，作为新的 App 发布，需要重新购买，大概得将近 20USD ，一直没舍得。就这么将就着老版本用了小三年。\n这期间，也尝试过一些其他的替代品，包括本站内被人推过的快启动之类的，但还是差点意思。所以，一直还对这款 App 念念不忘。\n最近 Google Play 有个活动，购买 App 可以减 2USD ，我也刚好凑了有 10 来 USD 的 Balance 了，就准备把最新款的 AppDialer 11 买下来。目前这个版本的售价是 13.99USD ，Balance 不够，于是就用信用卡充了 10USD 进去。\n充值的时候支付都很正常，但接下来购买 App 的时候，却提示“Couldn't complete your transaction. Your Play balance can only be used in United States. See the gift card terms of service”\n换了不同的时间节点，在手机端和 App 端都试过了，但都没办法成功支付。\n悲催了。\n另外吐槽一句，不知道为什么这类 App 基本上没有人去做开发，仅有的几个竞品，跟 AppDialer 相比，那体验差距还是很明显的。\n我个人分析，其中一个原因，是绝大多数人压根不知道这类 App 的用处，他们满足于系统自带搜索的毛坯性能。甚至更多的人，压根都不用搜索，要打开一个 App ，都是“退回桌面→划→划→划→戳开文件夹→点开 App”。这就跟一群整天只知道马车的人，很难想象汽车比马要强大好用得多。\n这也同时让我想起关于解锁刷机的问题。很多人买来手机，连系统自带的广告功能都不会关，却津津乐道于，指责别人要解锁要刷机的需求。\n因为，他们压根不知道什么是真正的好用。",

          "description": "Python 潮流周刊从 2023.05.13 连载至今，本周即将发布第 60 期，这意味着我们又要达成一个小小的里程碑啦！\n每周坚持做分享，周复一周，这对自己的精力和意志是一项不小的挑战。于是，为了让自己获得一些仪式感，我给自己定了一个较为合理的时间目标，就是每 30 期周刊作为一季。\n划分出“每一季”，并不是为了像电视剧一样找时间停播休息，而是为了让自己能做一些阶段性的盘点，给读者们分享一些数据、故事和感想，给自己加油鼓气。\n这篇文章并不是周刊第 2 季的盘点，而是一个预告，以及发放一些福利。\n🎁第一重福利\n小报童专栏的限时优惠券，错过就要再等 30 期啦（约 210 天）！\n新订阅者的 8 折优惠券（价值 25.6 元）： 点击领取\n老读者续订的 7 折优惠券（价值 38 元），请在最近几期周刊开头领取。\n🎁第二重福利\nPython 潮流周刊专栏的邀请返利已提升到 50%，当有人通过你分享的海报或者邀请链接，购买了专栏，那么你将获得 50% 的返利（价值 64 元）。\n🎁第三重福利\n第 1 季周刊精华内容出了精美电子书，现在给 Python 猫 公众号发送“W30”，可获取免费下载链接。内容包含 Markdown 、PDF 和 EPUB 三种版本，总字数超过 6.5 万字。\n在第 1 季完结时，我曾将 30 期的精华内容整理成一篇合集文章，也转换成了一本 PDF 电子书。但是当时把周刊内丰富的图片内容都删除了，排版上也非常粗陋。\n这次我不仅将图片都一一加回来了，而且增加了 EPUB 版本，还附上了 Markdown 源文件，应该能提升大家的阅读体验了吧？\n福利介绍完了，接下来再分享几张图吧。\n除了重新整理和排版第 1 季周刊的合集，我还对它做了几个维度的统计分析：\n（ 1 ）第 1 季周刊每一期内容统计\n\n可以看出前面几期的数据波动较大，但后来逐渐趋于稳定。\n（ 2 ）第 1 季周刊每一类内容统计\n\n可以看出我们是以文章和项目为主，而且数量非常之多（约占 90%）。\n（ 3 ）第 1 季周刊的词云图\n\n以上的电子书、图表和词云统计图，其实都是为了做第 2 季内容盘点而顺带完成的，一方面是为了先练练手，另一方面则是将过去有价值的内容再装点一番，让它不至于那么快消失于互联网中。\n最后，预告一下，等第 2 季完结后，我们还会发布第 2 季的精选电子书，敬请留意哦。（专栏付费订阅读者的福利，大家可以提前加猫哥微信为好友，到时领取）",

          "description": "避雷字节跳动 Flow AI 下的全球数据治理开发合规组，不确定是不是还有细分的小组，hr 说是个新成立没多久的组织，面试我的那个面试官似乎是在深圳。如果你不希望你参与一次无效面试，在字节的系统中增加一个挂面记录，千万不要去投递这个部门的岗位。\n面试过程我完整的写完了算法题+回答对了至少 90%的八股文，但最终结果是挂了。我强烈怀疑这个组根本不招人，这个面试官要么是为了完成 kpi 要么是为了探听求职者的信息。而且面试进入尾声后我想着聊一聊问个问题，就问了下他目前团队是个什么规模，主要做些什么事情，他就一脸叼的要死的态度说无可奉告，极其不专业。\n顺便吐槽一下字节的面试在线编程系统。考个链表或者树的题，连 Node 的定义都没有，竟然是让你从 Scanner 开始写。垃圾至极，能不能搞清楚考察的重点到底是什么。\n总之避雷避雷，毕竟系统中多一次挂面记录就多一个污点，我算帮大家趟过雷了。",

          "description": "注意标题里的两个 HDR 含义不一样，iPhone 4 相机的 HDR 拍摄是指拍多张曝光不同的照片，再机内合成为一张，使得成片的亮部不过曝、暗处不过黑，这是一种常见的摄影技术。后面的 HDR 是指 HDR 显示，即照片高光部分能以超过 SDR 范围的亮度去高亮显示。\n所以我是说，把 iPhone 4 拍的 HDR 照片放到现在支持 HDR 显示的苹果设备里，高光部分竟是能跟现在最新款 iPhone 拍的照片一样有 HDR 效果的！这个实现原理显然和自 iPhone 12 以来的 gain map HDR 不同，效果也没那么强烈，但的的确确是真实存在的。\n太超前了。\n如果你觉得在手机上看不明显，请使用支持 HDR 显示的 MacBook Pro ，打开相册，找到一张用 iPhone 4 拍摄的 HDR 照片（图片左上角会有 HDR 的标签），然后打开相册设置，反复开关 View Full HDR ，这样你能在 HDR 和 SDR 显示间快速切换。",

          "description": "现象\n最近 CDN 平台下，每天都有新增数十个不同用户的域名受到来自山西太原联通的几个固定 IP 网段的刷流量攻击。\n每天 20:00 左右开始，23:00 准时结束。\n攻击者会事先人为挑选体积较大的静态文件，例如音视频 mp4 、安装包 exe/apk 、体积较大的图片等，然后在攻击期间，不断请求这个文件，消耗流量。\n攻击者会将请求的 Referer 头设置为文件链接本身，User-Agent 则有时是随机的，有时为空。\n其实数月前就有体量较大的用户遇到这个问题，我们封死之后消停了一会儿，\n但最近开始无差别攻击，大站小站只要被它扫到的站，都会在这个时间段内开始高频请求。\n分析\n攻击者似乎并不想要将网站打死，而是慢慢地刷流量，每个域名刷的流量也不多，3 个小时内最多几百 GB 。\n一开始我们以为是普通的竞对行为，后来发现互联网上有蛮多类似案例反馈，来自不同 CDN 厂商平台，在 V2EX 上也看到几个类似的帖子：\nhttps://v2ex.com/t/1055422#r_14960872\nhttps://v2ex.com/t/1045318\n可以认为这个是一个比较广泛的现象。\n另外我们分析这些被攻击的网站的日志，发现攻击开始前的几天内，都会出现一个 153.101.*.* 的 IP （江苏联通） ，使用 Java/1.8.0_91 的 User-Agent 访问被攻击的网站里的资源，我们不确定这是否与攻击有关，但也没查到这是哪家的爬虫信息，也没搜到过前人关于这个 IP 的日志，如果你也遇到了这个攻击，可以检查下日志。\n猜测\n攻击者没有把哪个网站当成必须要拿下的目标，甚至你把它 IP 屏蔽之后，它也不在乎，仍旧到点继续刷同一个地址，即使这个地址会被拦截...\n根据时间、攻击者行为特征，我感觉与 省间结算政策 或者该政策推开后运营商加速封杀高上传家宽（比如 PCDN 之类的）有关系。\n至于到底是运营商自身拉平省际带宽差距的需要，还是政策导致的高上传家宽用户需要拉低上传下载比例来避开运营商的封杀？\n我感觉是后者，观察日志发现，攻击者大部分情况下，请求的还是山西联通网内的 CDN 节点，这是达不到拉平省际带宽差异的效果的。\n为什么要广撒网拿中小网站下手？我感觉是怕流量过于集中引起对方报警之类的，这样每个网站 1~200 GB 分摊下来，对于单个网站主来说，损失不大也不好立案。\n本段所述只是我个人的猜测，未经证实，也未有其它证据佐证，仅供参考。\n应对\n我们监控到异常的 CDN 域名后，会主动屏蔽相关 IP 访问，你也可以尝试屏蔽下列 IPv4 网段：\n221.205.168.0/23\n60.221.231.0/24\n211.90.146.0/24\n\n后续不知道会不会更换 IP ，但如果上述的猜测正确，攻击者自己频繁更换 IP 应该是不利于他所要实现的目的的。\n另外，CDN 端开启限流措施，例如 IP 访问频率限制、流量封顶限制等访问控制功能，也是非常有必要的，可以有效减少恶意攻击产生的流量，也能在发生攻击后尽快提醒你做出应对。",

          "description": "简单来说，就是选定的应用走特定的路由表，达到指定出口的效果，连防火墙规则都不用配置。简单到只需要几个字符的简短命令即可做到。\n比如，我可以在一台 FreeBSD 机器连接上 Cloudflare Warp ，连接时“改道”至副路由表（假设是1 号表）。连接完成后，WireGuard 会在副路由表中把默认路由指向 Cloudflare Warp 的 IP 。这样一来，其它程序都会不会受到影响，继续按照主路由表（即 0 号表）的规则通讯。\n如何使指定程序走 Cloudflare Warp 通道呢？我要 ping 命令走该通道，只需前面加一条 setfib 命令即可：\nsetfib 1 ping -c 10 8.8.8.8\n\n就这么简单。现在 ping 程序就从 Cloudflare Warp 通道出去了。各种联网程序都可以这样做。\n对于开机自启的服务程序，也可以使它们走副路由表。只需要编辑 rc.conf ，给对应程序添加_fib=1后缀即可。就像这样：\nsomesocks_enable=\"YES\"\nsomesocks_fib=1\n\nWireGuard 除外，需要编辑 wg*.conf 加一行 Table = 1 才可以。\n注意：需要先启用 FIB 。\n默认情况下，FreeBSD 只会提供单个路由表，想要启用副路由表就必须自行启用。步骤很简单：\n打开 /boot/loader.conf ，加入一行：\nnet.fibs=2\n\n重启系统。\n现在，0 号表就是默认路由表，我称之为主路由表。其它编号的就是副路由表。\n想要多少个路由表，数值就写多少。只要有需要，net.fibs=100都可以。\n我利用这个特点在 VPS 上连接了 Cloudflare Warp ，将*ray/ss 的流量改成走 Cloudflare Warp 通道，而自己的中转程序继续走默认路由表，达到入口 IP 和出口 IP 都不同的效果：\n利用 FreeBSD 主副路由表(FIB)在服务器使用 Cloudflare Warp\n在这个基础上可以延伸出更灵活的做法，比如同时连上多个 wireguard 隧道，多个 ss 分别走对应的通道，每个 ss 监听不同的端口，中转程序连接不同的端口即可实现动态切换出口位置。比起单路由表+策略路由，这样做的灵活度高了很多。\nPS: 中转程序不一定必须是我链接里的那个，也可以是其它转发程序",

          "description": "原文发布在我的网站上\n难以复刻的大问题\n第一个麻烦是现代框架解决的是“大”问题，而个体开发者遇不上“大”问题\n早些年如果你想从头学习一门前端框架，比如 BackboneJS 或者 EmberJS ，一定绕不开从构建一款 Todo 应用开始，它能让你直观感受到 model 与 view 之间是如何相互协作的。现在我们依然保留同样的传统，只不过它不在以 Todo 的形式存在，但依然会出现在文档的 Quick Start 小节中，企图用最少代码最大程度上展现技术的特性。\n问题在于早些年前端代码只是作为静态站点点缀般的存在，例如控制交互，填充内容——看看这段淘宝平台 09 年的代码你就会理解我在说什么。而如今 JavaScript 代码已经可以做到接管编译、路由、渲染，将应用端到端的呈现出来。最重要的是，它已将处理复杂问题的能力内置其中。然而这些复杂问题，从高并发到匪夷所思的业务场景，Quick Start 里的 demo 无法展现它们的全貌，个体也难以模拟。\nK8S 就是一个最好的例子。\n去年抱着学习的心态，我把我所有部署在 VPS 上的 side project 迁往 K8S ，甚至连应用的部署方式也替换为了 ArgoCD 。但实话实话这不是一笔划算的买卖，因为从结果上看，替换为 K8S 之后花费的计算资源更贵了，维护成本（脑袋里需要记住的东西、涉及到的步骤和需要持续维护的环境）也水涨船高。原因在于当架构简单到仅需单个 cluster 就足以支撑的时候，K8S 的边际成本无法被均摊。所以吊诡的事情出现了，你发现体感上新款 K8S 还不如旧款 PM2 好用。\n可不可以不关心大问题，全权委托给框架，我只管把 kubectl 命令全文背诵就好？——不行，因为 Copilot 永远记得比你滚瓜烂熟。面对 AI 的挑战，程序员无可避免的要将角色从执行者转变为决策者。\n说起来有些玄学，设计…",

          "description": "我应该去年发过一个帖子，主要讨论的是这几年一直在用公司配发的 Thinkpad 笔记本，不敢再将自己的笔记本带到公司去用。原因很简单，现在的企业监控软件实在是太厉害，比如深信服客户端，连微信聊天记录都能监控到，还有定时截屏等等功能\n其实当时还有另外一个很重要的因素没说，那就是钱的问题。\n现在大环境不好，我在我现在的公司呆了四年多了，也就从一个底层员工混到一个业务线研发负责人，最近三年时间里，部门就招了一个新人，没有人离职。\n就业行情真的是太差了，四年多时间里，我自己曾经投过不少简历出去但就面试过两次，一次挂了一次嫌弃地方远没去，仔细说来也基本算没地方可以去了。然后在自己这家公司里，干了四年多，工资也只在去年涨了一千五而已。\n现在的这个行情，我还能继续呆在现在的公司干几年，不好说，但我知道不管是职位还是工资，也基本是到头了。\n因为现在大家都不愿意动，岗位非常的稳定，所以工资也就十分的稳定。甚至因为大环境导致市场缩水，公司这两年做项目也是十分的保守，前几年项目接到手软，我们加班也非常多，但是这两年项目就很稳定，做完这一个才做下一个，加班也很少了。就是这样稳定的情况下，我觉得自己再去投资一台高配电脑，提升自己的工作效率是一件不划算的事情。\n当然了，我自己其实也是一个非常懒的人，下班回家再忙工作或者提升自己再或者自己接私活什么的，也是从来没有考虑的。年龄也大了，没有年轻时的那种冲劲，下班回家就想葛优瘫。\n除了玩游戏就是刷视频看电影。所以我家里使用的电脑就是一台丐版 macmini,接电视当电视盒子用的。曾经还发帖说 8G 内存的 Mac 很好用结果被一堆人喷。\n所以高配 Mac 对我来说基本就是毫无需求。\n我还记得 14 年的时候，我斥资 9 千买下了人生第一台 MacBookpro ，2013late 款，坚信这是一笔非常划算的投资，如今高配 Mac 已然来到了 2 万价位，依然还有很多人在做着这样的投资。\nå2 万其实谁都能拿得出来，但是真正愿意做这种投资并且坚信是值得的，也算是一种本事吧，至少我现在没有这种本事了。",

          "description": "做外包，最近遇到个异想天开的甲方，想预测彩票数字。该甲方自称潜心研究彩票 30 年，一直手算，现在觉得数据量太大了，想用程序实现。\n虽然这个甲方在我看来是异想天开，但是他提出的计算规则倒是没有漏洞，我本着反正只谁出钱谁上帝的原则，实现了出来，但是现在遇到了性能问题。\n他的算法并不复杂，首先，甲方提供了 75 个数字字符串，每个字符串都是 4 个数字，诸如 0123 3578 之类的。我在这里称其为样本数据。\n彩票的开奖数字，每期都是 5 位数字，它的算法里，把这 5 位数字拆开成 5 个，每个单独去和 75 个样本数据进行计算。\n一个样本字符串 + 开奖拆开的数字，会生成一系列值，这些值我接下来会有详述，这就是一行记录(每个生成的值是一列)。\n因为有 75 个字符串，所以就有 75 行，于是，一个被拆开的数字，会生成一张表格，这张表格有 75 行。\n又因为每期开奖数字是 5 位，所以每期彩票的开奖数字最后都会有 5 张表。\n生成值（表格的列）有以下部分：\nA1：找上一期的开奖数字，计算上一期的开奖数字是否在对应行样本数据中出现过。\nA2：当前开奖数字是否在样本数据中出现过？无论出现还是没出现状态，都从当前这期往之前的开奖记录回溯，如果状态和目前这期一致，就累加数值，直到出现一期和当前这一期不一样的状态，就终止(我大致看了一下平均遍历次数在 5 左右)。\nQ15B：从当前期倒退 61 期，然后从此为起点遍历 30 期，只要这 30 期的开奖数字，命中了对应的样本数据，就+1 ，然后获得最终值。如果之前的期数不够，则该数据无效\nQ15R：从当前期倒退 31 期，然后从此为起点遍历 30 期，只要这 30 期的开奖数字，命中了对应的样本数据，就+1 ，然后获得最终值。如果之前的期数不够，则该数据无效\nP15B：从当前期倒退 16 期，然后从此为起点遍历 15 期，要要这 15 期的开奖数字，命中了对应的样本数据，就+1 ，然后获得最终值。如果之前的期数不够，则该数据无效。\nP15R：从当前期倒退 31 期，然后从此为起点遍历 15 期，只要这 15 期的开奖数字，命中了对应的样本数据，就+1 ，然后获得最终值。如果之前的期数不够，则该数据无效，\nP15X：把前面的 A1 ，A2 ，Q15B Q15R P15B P15R 以一个简单的排列规则后得到的分类数。\nQ15X：就是上一期的 P15X （也就是把上一期的 P15X 算一遍出来，所以如果之前期数不够，那么这个数据算不出来\nC618：这是性能罪魁祸首，先不在这里算，问题在下面讲，先跳过。\n就此你可以看到，这个过程从 A1 到 P15R 往前遍历了 1 + 5 + 30 +30 + 15 +15 = 96 次。然后为了算出 Q15X ，又来了一遍，所以遍历了 192 次。问题是，这仅仅是一行（因为是和一个样本字符串在对比），而这个表有 75 行，于是这个循环对比的过程执行了 75 x192 = 14400\n然后我们每期开奖数字有 5 位，也就是说每期有 5 张这样的表，因此是 14400 x 5 = 72000 次。\n这个代码我用的语言是 Java 。循环 72000 次，每一次几乎都进行了对比运算和累加运算，对比运算很简单用的是字符串查找 indexOf 方法。根据我反复测试，程序在预热完毕完毕后，执行上述计算花费时间是 45-50 毫秒。\n45-50 毫秒也不算长啊。本来到这里还没太奇葩的，但是接下来甲方就有骚操作想法了。还记得前面写的那个 C618 吗？甲方的意思是，从目前的这期开奖记录开始，往前倒退 618 期，以此为起点，计算从此开始到当期为止（共 617 期）的从 A1 到 Q15X 的全部值。然后把这 617 的 A1 到 Q15X 和当前期的 A1 到 Q15X 按一定规则对比，比中了就累计值。\n于是上面那计算一次要 45-50 毫秒的操作，要算 617 次。。。算一次 30 秒就过去了。。。\n我想了很久，也没想到该怎么优化这个问题，这妥妥的是 CPU 密集型运算，但是它的算法规则不复杂，甚至可以说相当简单，除了向前追溯的次数太多了之外，整个运算过程几乎的规则就是对比和累计，对比的规则也就是要么查有没有，要么相等不相等。。。\n我一度想看看那个 72000 次花费 45-50 毫秒的过程有没有优化的空间，但是看来看去也不知道该优化哪里。\n目前我暂时不想考虑换语言之类的手段。\n有没有算法大佬来聊聊这个场景该怎么办呢？",

[Yes,/I'm -> Years/are] packed, but not quite ready. I can't find my passport. [Your -> ]    -\n [ -> You] passport? That's the one thing you [mustn't -> must/not] leave behind. I know. I haven't lost it. I've packed [it,/but -> it./But] I [can't -> cannot] remember [which/bag. -> what/it/is.]“\n中括号里的即为你念错的地方。\n\n我的使用方法：\n因为我日常都是去找四六级的听力去练习朗读，因此我下载了全套的历年四六级听力。（也因此需要剪切，每次用 ffmpeg 命令行也挺麻烦的）。\n1.该脚本会先针对你剪好的标准音频进行语音识别，得到文本打印下来。\n2.然后你只需要对着这个文本朗读即可。\n3.最后分析出你哪些地方读错了，哪些地方读的是正确的。\n我的初衷是想做完整朗读中每个单词提供发音百分比置信度的功能，但是当我做到一半的时候，开始写什么 MFCC 音频提取、DTW 算法匹配的时候，才意识到我其实是把简单问题复杂化了。\n日常生活中，大部分人都是不敢说，以及熟悉的单词不会念，能开口实际上就赢了大半，不至于说要每个单词都非常标准发音，这样反而会很奇怪。于是我觉得只要能大声朗读出能让机器识别出来的句子，就能够实现我的目标。至于需要聚焦到更细节的每个单词的严苛发音，我觉得随便一个背单词的 app 就能做到。\n我之前用 chatGPT 对话练习过，但是后面发现很多时候我并不是缺乏对话，而是缺乏开口念英语的连贯性、自然性。我单词都念错了，AI 还能跟我继续唠嗑。读书的时候英语早读课过于注重单个单词的记忆而忽略了完整文章的朗读。如果仅仅是需要找个对话练习，用 chatGPT 就够了。我个人认为这个脚本解决的痛点也是在于：连贯对话的口语纠错。\n\n本脚本也是为了抛砖引玉，肯定有体验更好的方案，希望有大佬如果有兴趣可以开发出来让我使用使用，我这个确实有点简陋。",

          "description": "第一次发帖，如果节点有错还请管理大大帮忙移动下\n先大概介绍下我使用的方案：\n  通过 RouterOS+Surge+SmartDNS 实现客户端无感知分流，ros 将指定客户端的 dns 请求劫持至 smardns ，smardns 对国内域名返回真实 ip ，分流域名返回 fakeip ，同时在 ros 上设置将 fakeip 段路由至 surge 网关，最终实现分流和代理。ros 上对 surge 网关进行监控，当服务异常时会自动关闭劫持。具体可以看我的折腾手记： https://dddafa.notion.site/RouterOS-Surge-SmartDNS-334831ae5792422796cca2f9d4f3ab8d\n为什么使用这个方案：\n  我是使用 apple 生态，surge 各端基本通用的配置文件自然成为了我的首选，一开始我是采用 surge 网关作为 DHCP 服务器后面变成 ros 对指定客户端下发 surge 配置。但本质没有变化。在使用 surge 网关中有一点小问题：\n1 、测速跑不满带宽上限，会低 50Mbps 左右 \n2 、上传测速会变成局域网速率(有可能是测速网的问题，我没有去深究) \n3 、考虑到 surge 网关挂掉的情况,虽然概率比较低但有发现过。 \n所以就开始研究一个更适合我需求的方案，最终发现 dns 分流很适合我，遂开始搭建，后面查阅相关文档发现 surge 网关模式下对所有域名都返回 fakeip ，虽然有 always-real-ip 参数，但貌似官方没有给这个参数引用文件的权限。所以加入 smartdns 作为查询服务器，经过几天的实际使用下来，非常稳定，即使网关挂了 也能自动的切换回正常 dns 不影响国内网站访问。\n不知道诸位坛友们有没疑问或者有什么更加优秀的方案，欢迎探讨",

          "description": "前两次拔牙都是拔完后医生嘱咐顶不住就吃消炎药和止疼药，药也压不住就来急诊或者复诊，这次我灵机一动，我干嘛不手术前就吃。\n于是 12 点多在北大口腔三院取完号后吃了布洛芬和阿司匹林。\n电锯/钻 滋滋作响磨着牙，感觉跟钓鱼佬铁锹挖蚯蚓一样掏啊掏，没有像前两次走出医院就开始逐渐发热、巨疼。分泌的口水血也明显没那么多了。\n坐两小时地铁回去，骑 20 分钟共享电动车，回单位上班跑报修。\n最大的遗憾是每次来看牙一面对医生就迷迷糊糊的，好些都没记住。\n网上一直有说拔牙对女医生不友好，力度不够的话反复拉扯，就算是打麻药了也顶不住这么造。但比较搞的是选择明日挂号看到的空余的都是女医生。好大夫在线、官网之类的能搜到对方信息。有号就挂了，这几天北京也不算特别热。\n右下的智齿横着长了，拍完片后付费上班的医学生没给我拔，只拔了右上的智齿。说下面智齿要先把漏出来的牙磨切掉再把肉下面的牙弄出来，因为靠近神经可能会导致这侧面部麻木，是个大活。他好像是在暗示我不能挂普通号让付费上班的高资带教医学生拔这个牙。\n对比了 A 北京口腔天坛院区普通号、B 北大口腔总院普通号、C 北大口腔三院医师号，觉得比较离谱的是，这三个地方的拔牙后注意事项居然有好几条不重合的。北京口腔天坛院区八个注意事项，北大口腔总院五个注意事项，北大口腔三院十个注意事项] 。\nhttps://imgur.com/a/nP7Rpqv\n没有重合的注意事项有：\n1. A 三日内避免拔牙测咀嚼;\n2. A 拔牙后遵医嘱吃消炎药止痛药，有 XX 情况去综合医院发热门诊消炎退热；\n3. C 拔牙后感觉有硬物存留，可能是残留的碎片或者牙槽骨外落巴拉巴拉；\n最震惊的是，北大口腔三院的医师问我带片子了吗，我说在北大口腔总院拍过你在系统查下，她说查不了。\n得亏我手机拍的有，不然又得重新拍片。\n比较搞的是 抽血验的时候，医生跟挤奶一样双手挤压手肘附近，加速血液流动。让我如临大敌，莫非我还贫血。\nA 电子化最落后，好些要人工，不能自助机挂号取号签到，交单子给分诊台工作人员人工派给医生。\nB 总院最爽，除了完事后得去人工窗口缴费再把一联给医生和取药，大部分都能自助机解决。当时我是牙周复诊，看时间还够就自助机现场挂号开始了第二次拔智齿牙。\nC 就两层，面积不大，不同科室找着不费劲，缺点就是只有二层有卫生间。\n下一步就是找机会做个综合检查看有没有啥隐患。我开始看牙是因为有几天周一侧牙龈肿了影响吃饭说话，硬抗了过去，结果发现牙龈鼓包消不下去，一两个月了还越来越大。 小红书搜了一圈不是买点药吃就能完事的，就去了北京口腔天坛院区，因为他们家有免费初筛，然后建议去看啥科室，最终确定先冲牙消肿解决智齿冠周炎，拔智齿，洗牙刮治割牙龈瘤，在拔智齿。\n各位老哥多关注牙齿卫生健康。",

          "description": "随着工作越来越忙，很少看剧了，最近看了一部《大明王朝 1566 》，又叫做《嘉靖与海瑞》，豆瓣评分 9.8 分。\n历史背景\n公元 1566 年是明朝时期，嘉靖皇帝嘉靖 45 年，这一年嘉靖皇帝去世，隆庆帝继位。\n嘉靖帝是明朝第 12 任皇帝，嘉靖这个年号是从 1522 年到 1566 年。历史上有名的道长皇帝，一生迷信道教，执着长生不老。同时在位期间，20 年不上朝，但是又暗中把持朝政，牢牢控制着朝廷的大权。\n有人说明朝的衰亡就是从他开始，也有人说是他造成了明朝的中兴，为后面的万历改革打下了基础。\n功过是非自有后人和史学家评论，不可否认的是他在位期间，朝廷出现了很多有名的大臣，如夏言，严嵩，严世蕃，徐阶，高拱，张居正，海瑞，对外的将领有胡宗宪，俞大猷，戚继光等等，群星璀璨的时代。\n电视剧\n以上说的都是历史背景，这部电视剧由小说改编而来，自然改编了一些历史事实，比如司礼监这边虚构了吕芳，陈洪，黄锦的一些事，胡宗宪与严嵩之间跳过了赵文华，史书记载严嵩是个身材高挑的大帅哥，而严世蕃是个独眼龙，这也与剧中有所不同。\n电视剧中，嘉靖皇帝迷信修仙问道，将朝中权利一分为三，分别委派给司礼监，以严嵩为首的严党，以裕王为首的清流。三派之间互相争斗，互相制衡，形成三足鼎立的模式，而嘉靖就在其中调停，达到控制全局的目的。\n剧中的每一个人个性非常的鲜明。\n人物\n徐阶\n对于徐阶来说是忍。\n严嵩当内阁首辅，徐阶当次辅，这样的关系已经持续了十几二十年。\n有一集司礼监老祖宗吕芳被临时派走了，二祖宗陈洪当差，而内阁严嵩被告知回家养病，由内阁次辅徐阶行使实际权力。这时候千年老二陈洪一副小人嘴脸，本来在司礼监批红的奏章，直接拿到了徐阶当值的内阁中，并主动对徐阶示好：“不管怎么说，我都比阁老晚一辈，往后只要阁老在内阁当值，我都过这来批红。”徐阶言辞拒绝了陈洪，并对他背诵了那篇韩愈的《祭十二郎文》：“近日，徐某重读…",

Prior versions of npm would also recursively inspect all dependencies. To get the old behavior, use npm --depth 9999 update.\n官网 v7 的说明\nhttps://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v7/commands/npm-update\nThis command will update all the packages listed to the latest version (specified by the tag config), respecting the semver constraints of both your package and its dependencies (if they also require the same package).\n我理解的结论\n意味着 npm 的版本在执行 npm update 时\n<2.6.1：默认会递归更新\n2.6.1-6：默认不会递归，可以使用 depth 指定深度\n>=7：默认会\n\n关于 npm update 是否会影响 package.json 的说明\n官网 v6 的说明\nhttps://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v6/commands/npm-update#description\nAs of npm@5.0.0, the npm update will change package.json to save the new version as the minimum required dependency. To get the old behavior, use npm update --no-save.\n官网 v8 的说明\nhttps://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v8/commands/npm-update\nNote that by default npm update will not update the semver values of direct dependencies in your project package.json, if you want to also update values in package.json you can run: npm update --save (or add the save=true option to a configuration file to make that the default behavior).\n我理解的结论\n意味着 npm 的版本在执行 npm update 时\n<5：默认不会更新 package.json\n5-7：默认会\n>=8：默认不会\n\n请教一下大家，我这这样理解正确么？\n但是我做实验，和我的理解不一样，搞不懂为什么了？\n关于第一点\n我使用 volta install node@8 ，默认匹配的 npm 版本是 6.13.4 ，按照我的理解 npm update 不应该更新包所依赖的包，但是我观察了 pacakge-json.lock ，它更新了，不太理解为什么。\n关于第二点\n同样使用 6.13.4 的 npm ，不会更新 package.json ，也不太理解为什么。\n所以请教一下各位大佬，是不是我看文档的理解有问题？提前感谢大家了，谢谢🙏",

          "description": "周末看到隔壁有个帖子讨论memos，感觉现在不管是官方电报群还是 github issue ，大家普遍对产品的设计思路上（主要是功能变更）或多或少有点不满。\nmemos 作为一款开源软件，我在其仅 700 个 star 的时候就开始部署使用（当时在寻找 flomo 的开源替代品），现在已然是个 28.5k 的知名项目了，这两年已经写了两千多张卡片了。恰逢去年今天，我在毫无 go 语言和前段开发基础的情况下，借着搜索引擎开始魔改开发自己想要的功能，作为魔改一周年的纪念，周末趁着难得的空闲，录了个B 站视频汇总介绍一下这一年的所有魔改。\n搞笑的是，一年过去了，我到现在也还没系统学过 go 语言和前端，仅有一点非专业的 python 知识，但是已经可以非常轻松地在 Github Copilot 和 GPT4 的帮助下去魔改实现我想要的各种功能了，这算是这一年很大的一个收获了。\n比如我现在完全不知道 Typescript ，Vue ，React 这些的差异，问 GPT 的时候也是统称为“这是一段 Typescript 代码...”，或者“帮我用 Typescript 实现...”\n发视频的原因也是因为好奇心想了解下，这些我为自己度身定制的功能，对其他人来说是不是也是好用的功能，因为我经常脑补如果自己是 memos 的官方开发者：如果我发布这些功能会不会也被人吐槽。。。（排除代码写的很烂的原因）",

PixelOS ，优点是尽可能接近 Pixel 体验，但是开发者名言目前版本还不支持自适应刷新率和杜比视界。\n2. LineageOS ，目前标示为非正式稳定版，似乎没有什么明显的功能缺失。\n3. AOSPA （ Paranoid ），暂时没看到其他用户反馈比较明显的 bug ，其他 ROM 的用户反而提到这个 ROM 电池寿命、AOD 等功能很赞。但之前从未刷过这个 ROM ，还是心里没底。\n4. CherishOS ，也是从未刷过的 ROM ，开发者说没什么 issue ，但下面的用户反馈有不少 bug 。\n恳请在用或通过小米 13 各种类原生 ROM 的 V 友，分享一下你的使用体验和建议，感谢！",

          "description": "之前几年一直用的 pdd ，没出什么意外，前几天只是看不惯 pdd 有些行为，想着不能惯着流氓，就试了下 tb 。\n前二天第一次下单，买了些调料和一个小电器，一搜我要的电器牌子，排前面的有个比别家便宜很多的，就是原价差不多，但有个大的优惠券，总价下来 1/3 左右。我当时就想这价不太可能，但因为几年没收到假货了，所以也没放心上。\n到货后，在快递站，因为想着价格因素可能有猫腻，所以我先开箱验货，果然一开箱发现发的货是同品类外形非常相似但牌子和网站说明的不一样，做工一看也很垃圾，当场拒收，并点了只退款。然后显示等待卖家 24 小时内处理，我就走人了（之前在 pdd 也退过小物件，秒退款，但不知道几百元级的小电器类是什么流程）。\n过了二天想起来看看退款情况，24 小时早过去了，但退款单状态变成了“商家拦截快递 商家将在 2 天 xx 时 xx 分处理“，不知道是商家在尽量延长这个时间还是 tb 的只退款流程就这样。\n去看了下这个商品的评论，果然买家发的开箱图片都和商品描述牌子不一样，想在下面评论让后来人别上当，但发不出去，显示“用户信用双零“，好吧，这个 tb 帐号确实是新注册的，确实没有任何办法报复这个店。看了下这个店，只有三个商品，月销过千，保证金 500 元（这么少吗？感觉可以随时跑路新开）\n总结：网上买东西别贪小便宜，大件最好开箱验下货，否则搬回家再回去退太折腾了。",

          "description": "在 3 个月前，我在 V2EX 上首次分享了 PeerBanHelper这个小工具，用来和 hp/torrent 、dt/torrent 进行技术对抗。\n在这之后越来越多的朋友们加入了 PBH 社区，并贡献了许多关键模块和代码，在此对各位为 PBH 做出贡献的人们说声感谢。\n3 个月的更新迭代，现在新推出了 v4.3 版本，除了简单的过滤器，现在更支持伪装检测等等新功能，变化之大我想值得新开一贴再向各位重新介绍一下。\n新增支持的下载器\n在各位朋友的支持下，我们新扩展了两款下载器的支持，分别是：\nDeluge\nBiglyBT (Vuze/Azureus 家族)\n只需要分别安装为上述两款 BT 下载器安装扩展插件(Deluge|BiglyBT)，就可以连接到 PeerBanHelper 了。\n对于还不支持的下载器，可以先使用收集的 IP 规则库，降低影响。\n多拨检测\n感谢 Github 用户 @CharlesChou73 的出色贡献。PeerBanHelper 新版本现在还支持多拨检测，能够有效检测同一 IP 段下的大量异常用户并封禁它们，例如下图这样的：\n\n连锁封禁\n在新的版本里，当特定网段内有 Peers 触发规则被封禁时，它也会连锁封禁同网段下其它的 Peers ，即使它们没有触发多拨检测。\n新的 AviatorScript 脚本引擎\n新版本中全新添加了 AviatorScript 脚本引擎 以允许 PBH 的用户进行编程，编写自定义的脚本，改变 PBH 的行为。\n并由其拓展了两个基于 AviatorScript 的新功能：\nPeerID / ClientName 伪装检测\nPeerID/ClientName 伪装检测可以检测 PeerID 和 ClientName 不对应的客户端，例如 PeerID 是 -TR2770-，但 ClientName 却标注为 qBittorrent/4.2.5 的客户端。\n吸血雷判断\n根据特征判断迅雷是否是吸血变种，在 PeerID 和 ClientName 过滤器禁用迅雷检查后，AviatorScript 迅雷检测脚本就可以开始工作，通过 吸血雷快查表 判断迅雷是否是吸血变种，并只封禁吸血的变种。\n新的 WebUI\n在 @Gaojianli, @XiaoXice 和 @Kaffu-Chino 三位朋友的加入后，PeerBanHelper 的 WebUI 相比上次发帖的版本也获得了质的飞跃。\n除了现在支持通过 WebUI 添加、编辑、删除下载器外，还新增了封禁日志，规则订阅等多个模块。\n下载器\n封禁名单\n封禁日志\n规则订阅\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWindows 安装程序\n之前有朋友提出过建议，在 Windows 上部署困难，现在 PeerBanHelper 也提供了 Windows 的安装程序。和其它的软件一样，双击运行一路下一步就可以安装上了 ;)\n对于 Linux 包管理器和 MacOS 的安装包目前还在研究 install4j 中。这些系统的小伙伴还是要手动装一下 JRE 或者使用 Docker 镜像。\n社区其它内容\n在上次发帖后，PBH 社区也迎来不少 BT 爱好者小伙伴，我们一起建设了一个仓库存放一些可能有用的东西，比如：\nPeerID 速查表 与 @ie12 一起维护的快查表，可以 Ctrl+F 快速查找 PeerID 和客户端对应关系\n吸血雷参考表\n获取 PeerBanHelper\nhttps://github.com/PBH-BTN/PeerBanHelper\n注：gitcode.com 上面的仓库不是我们传的 :(\n最后聊聊别的\n最初编写这款工具的时候，仅仅用于临时目的，并希望这种行为能够随着时间逐渐消失。然而现实是，随着时间推移，这种刷流量的方法似乎正在传播的越来越广。\n在这种情况泛滥后，看到不少朋友决定停止做种/屏蔽整个中国 IP 地址。破坏者为了满足一己私欲，正在波及和摧毁整个国内的 BT 生态（特别是在 IPV6 普及后，难得有所好转之时）。\n希望 PeerBanHelper 能够帮助到那些仍然愿意把互联网精神继续坚持下去的朋友们。不求回报，帮到就好 ;)\n感谢\n感谢这些朋友们，为 PBH 贡献代码，或者参与公共资源编写（排名不分先后）：\n@ie12\n@Gaojianli\n@PluieM\n@zhongfly\n@CharlesChou73\n@DDSRem\n@Ovler-Young\n@BUnipendix\n@Kaffu-Chino\n@XiaoXice\n@azicen",

          "description": "去年十月买的极摩客 G3 N100 迷你主机，安装 PVE 系统不间断使用，出现问题前一直正常工作，从今年 4 月中开始出现自动关机掉电：\n具体情况为开机后过一段时间后机器掉电关机，刚开始时间间隔能有两三天，后来间隔不断减少到几小时、几分钟，甚至掉电后马上按电源键无任何反应，拔掉电源让他休息几分钟后恢复，找了一个 12V 的电源替换，问题依旧，此时我判断为硬件出现了问题，考虑向官方申请售后。\n刚开始以为是硬盘问题，因为查看硬盘 SMART 信息确实有一些异常数据，且系统日志也一直提示，于是更换硬盘，问题依旧，所以异常数据应该是机器自动掉电导致的，而不是硬盘坏了导致的机器掉电。\n五月初申请了售后，五月中售后回电表示安装 Ubuntu 两周并没有复现问题，我提出安装 PVE 8.2 系统看能否复现 ，售后答应了，并在 3 天后回电表示 PVE 8.2 确实会自动掉电关机，PVE 8.1 两天未关机，刚好我也是在四月升级到的 PVE 8.2 ，且离售后结束时间较近，我便同意了售后以软件问题为由原返机器。不清楚他是否有进行一些机器硬件元件的基础检查。\n六月初收到机器后我便安装 PVE 8.1 开始使用，刚好也是两周没有出现问题，月中又开始了自动掉电关机，我手动开机依然在 3 天后自动掉电关机，此时可以确定和系统无关了，是硬件问题。\n我自己观察出来的一些规律就是，机器断电休息的时间越久，不自动掉电的时间就越长，如来回快递期间机器休息了 3-4 天，之后开机就能坚持半个月，然后随着通电时间越久自动掉电越快。\n现在的话，我考虑二次向官方申请售后，但是为了避免售后那边也没有维修思路，找不到问题所在，然后又不愿意以换代修，所以向 V 友们请教一下，这种情况一般会是什么元器件损坏？",

          "description": "关于找工作，最近行情很差。很多人不甘心，不接受找不到合适工作，经历心态崩溃的过程。有些人不能理解为什么工作突然变得有多么难找。浅浅分析了一下，假设市场处于扩张期，公司 A 新开了业务，增加了 10 个岗位，这 10 个人可能是从别的公司跳槽过来的，也可能是原本就没工作的人。假设有 5 个是跳槽的，5 个是原本没工作的。于是 5 个跳槽的原公司就有缺了 5 各职位，市场上有多出来五个职位空缺，那么在一段时间内。市场上的有效职位其实是 15 个，此时相对而言工作容易找。因为一个失业的人，除了那 10 个新增的机会，还有跳槽空出来的五个机会。而市场处于收缩期的话，公司裁掉 10 个人，原本可能想裸辞或者跳槽的人突然也不敢了。也就是说除了整体职位的变少，连跳槽空来的职位也变少了，同时求职的人还变多了。所以此时有效职位减少的更多。所以这多少有点踩踏的味道。类似银行挤兑和通缩螺旋。\n关于找国外公司，即使英语过关很可能也不容易。因为换位思考，一个外国人很可能没听说过你读的学校或者你工作过的公司。名校和名企除外。所以他很难识别你的水平，哪怕你真的实力达到水平。换位思考，你要招一个外国人，他读的大学你没听说过，你很可能认为是个野鸡大学。他工作过的公司你也没听说过。很难知道是不是个皮包公司或者是个虚构的公司。所以你倾向于不冒这个风险，所以这就是很多人强调 GitHub 的作用，因为这是除了学历和名企之外。最能证明你实力的东西。\n关于才华。通常我们认为一个人有才华，我们指的是什么？我们会认为周杰伦有才华，我们也会认为林丹有才华，高考状元有才华。但是这里面的才华是有所不同的。因为周杰伦有才华是因为他创作出了优秀的作品，而林丹和高考状元是在一种制定好的规则中通过竞技取得名次。发现没有，前者是有作品，真正的产生了产品。而后者一种内卷，竞技排名。优秀的音乐创作者有很多，但是竞技体育的冠军只有一个。所以如果你错过了高考，没有在考试中取得一个好成绩。你想证明你有才华，大概率只有创作出优秀的作品这一条路了。\n找工作背八股文也是一种竞技体育，你背，你的竞争对手也在背。这是一种没完没了的核竞赛，这是当前技术面试的现状。希望所有看到这段文字的面试官都不要再考察八股文了。希望大家通过作品证明自己才华。",

          "description": "因为我在自己的媒体服务器里使用的都是 PT 站上的资源，而媒体服务器通常都要求文件名遵循一定的格式（比如 Jellyfin），所以需要重命名做种的文件。虽然我用的 qBittorrent 可以重命名文件并继续做种，但一个一个重命名实在麻烦，后面就通过 Bash 脚本来干这个事，批量将视频文件软链接到对应的媒体文件夹，这样就可以同时做种和提供媒体服务。\n但由于 Bash 语言的局限，这个脚本的扩展性不太好，现在重新用 Python 写了一个专门批量重命名/链接/移动文件的 CLI 工具：batchlink。Python 自带电池，很多我需要的函数标准库里都有，所以实现起来很简单。\n举一个我自己的例子：\nbatchlink -s \\\n  -S \"/srv/resources/Videos/Animation/死亡笔记/\" \\\n  -d \"/srv/emby/Animation/Death Note: Desu nôto (2006)/Season 01/\" \\\n  '*.mkv' 'Death Note: Desu nôto S01E{num:02}.mkv'\n\n-s 表示创建软链接；-S 指定源文件夹；-d 指定目标文件夹；第一个位置参数是一个 glob 通配符，用来筛选需要链接的文件；第二个位置参数是一个 Python f-string ，是创建链接名的模板。模板里的 {num:02} 会按字母表顺序被替换成从 1 开始的序号，还有一些其他的替换变量可以使用，比如从 0 开始的序号 i。\n希望有需求的 V 友可以尝试一下、提提意见：）",

          "description": "一切开始于两件事：\n(1)\n用 Winhawk 更改开始菜单和任务栏样式。\n在颜色选项那里选了自定义之后，把 Windows 颜色调成暗色同时应用颜色保持浅色。这样就导致开始菜单顶部的搜索框依然保持浅色，在暗色的开始菜单下显得十分违和。\n所以我想到了用 Winhawk 把搜索框的大小调到了最小，直接让它消失，这才解决了视觉上的违和感。\n(2)\n更改注册表让 Win11 右键直接展开全部菜单。\n这种方法我看不懂实现原理，但是 Reddit 的网友说是在注册表里添加一些项，让一级菜单无法展开从而让 explorer 不得不直接展开二级菜单。位置在：\nHKEY_CURRENT_USER\\Software\\Classes\\CLSID\\{86ca1aa0-34aa-4e8b-a509-50c905bae2a2}\\InprocServer32\n后面两项本来没有，都是手动添加的。\n没错，就这两种事，我被国内和国外的网友同时警告过不要做侵入 explorer 的事情。我想知道这两件事是如何实现的？会对系统关键功能造成不可忽视的影响吗？",

          "description": "（先此声明：标题所言「关闭」是指运营商局端关闭，而非用户手机端关闭）\n本人 iPhone 15 Pro Max ，卡 1 移动 8 元保号套餐（每月 30 分钟通话时长，无数据流量），卡 2 电信（通话时长和数据流量都管够），手机设置仅由卡 2 提供蜂窝数据，「允许切换蜂窝数据」功能未启用。\n最近从 10086 下发的短信发现卡 1 每月会产生少量（ 0.几至 3.几 MB ）数据流量（身边朋友和本站都有相同情况 /t/878140 /t/990518 /t/1005849 /t/1032855 ），于是想让移动关闭该卡上网功能。其实这张卡降至保号套餐时就想过关闭上网功能，但当时移动客服说关闭上网功能会导致高清语音通话不可用，所以我权衡一下就没关。但最近在网上看到江苏移动可关闭上网功能并办理「独立高清语音」业务，让我内心一喜。\n\n更多参考链接：\nhttps://www.v2ex.com/t/1032855#r_14598179\nhttps://tieba.baidu.com/p/8962476840\nhttps://www.xiaohongshu.com/explore/6644163a000000001e032201\nhttps://www.txrjy.com/thread-1335643-1-1.html\n\n然而，我联系 10086 后，广东移动客服表示取消上网功能就无法使用高清语音通话，也没有所谓的「独立高清语音」业务可办理，如果想关闭上网功能并保留高清语音通话，可以选择「暂停」上网功能，这个「暂停上网功能」不会与高清语音通话互斥。但是，槽点来了：会在下个月结日自动恢复上网功能，届时需要用户再次办理暂停方可再次关闭上网功能…… 您就说移动这操作恶不恶心人？\n行，咱无可奈何选择暂停上网功能，此时手机依然能连接到 4G/5G 网络，也能使用 VoLTE 或 VoNR ，然后我试着将「 iPhone - 设置 - 蜂窝网络 - 蜂窝数据」关闭，此时 iPhone 状态栏信号格旁的 4G/5G 文字消失。\n\n\n\n然后我用移动卡和电信卡分别拨打 10086 、10000 ，同时通过 *3001#12345#* 查看 Cellular Service Status ，发现此时通话模式均为 VoNR （我之前一直以为必须要开启手机的蜂窝数据功能才能使用 VoLTE/VoNR ，原来不是，这点我在安卓手机上也试验了同样如此）\n\n\n好，最后回到标题：广东移动是否支持关闭数据流量功能并保留高清语音通话(VoLTE/VoNR)？\n是，也不是。\n（ PS.至于暂停上网功能能否不在下个月结日自动恢复，而是由用户有需求时再办理恢复上网功能。有用户此前向广东移动投诉过，广东移动至今不予解决。https://www.txrjy.com/forum.php?mod=redirect&goto=findpost&ptid=1335637&pid=13911798 ）",

          "description": "一、股票行情报价 api 接口\n量化投资者，获取即时的实时行股票行情报价数据是金融从业者和投资者必不可少的需求之一。随着技术的发展，美股数据、A 股数据、港股数据的实时行情数据 API 、行情数据接口成为了实现这一目标的主要方式之一。美股实时行情 API 是指一种应用程序接口，通过它可以获取美股市场上的实时股票价格、交易量等数据。通过使用美股实时行情数据 API ，用户可以实时监测股市动态、进行实时交易决策，从而更好地把握市场机会。\n但是，要想充分利用美股实时行情报价 API 、行情数据接口，首先需要对美股实时股票行情数据有着清晰的理解。美股实时股票行情数据涵盖了股票的实时价格、成交量、市值等信息，是投资者进行交易决策的重要依据之一。因此，美股实时行情数据对接成为了金融科技领域的热门话题之一。通过实现美股行情数据、K 线数据对接，用户可以将实时行情数据与自己的交易系统或者分析工具相连接，实现更加精准的交易决策和风险管理。\n二、以 MT5 接入实时股票行情数据为例，讲述接入步骤：\n2.1 、选择好你要接入的股票行情源：AllTick api\n [官网] : https://alltick.co/\n [ Github ] ： https://github.com/alltick/realtime-forex-crypto-stock-tick-finance-websocket-api\n [接入流程] ： https://github.com/alltick/realtime-forex-crypto-stock-tick-finance-websocket-api/blob/main/access_guide_cn.md\n2.2 、接入实现原理\nMT5 官方提供了整套的 Gateway 接口，通过继承特定的类，实现一些就可以把股票行情数据报送到 MT5 Trade Server,这就上涉及到以下几个大步骤：\n先拿到行情源的实时行情报价数据，实时的，源源不断的得到\n再实现继承 MT5 Gateway API 的程序\n然后通过具体的推送方法把数据推送到 MT5 Trade Server 。\n2.3 、MT5 Gateway API 介绍\nMT5 Gateway API 是用于将 MT5 平台与其他交易系统或者行情数据源集成的一整套工具接口。使用 Gateway API ，您可以实现自定义交易网关和数据源。Gateway API 是一整套 API 功能,包括所使用的数据结构的描述、网关的标识符和虚拟接口， 它的开发语言是 C++，开发工具常以 visual studio 为主，它提供的 32 位和 64 位 DLL 库的源代码示例。涉及与交易平台互动的所有技术细节都隐藏在 DLL 库中，这可以使用简单的方法来控制集成。因此，开发人员的代码不取决于内部变化，并且代码始终都可运行。\n2.4 、具体的接入步骤\n2.4.1 、接入股票行情数据源-AllTick\n接入 AllTick 的实时股票行情源请参考上面 2.1 章节的链接，按照接入流程一步一步就接好了，接好之后数据备用。\n2.4.2 、初始化 CMTGatewayAPIFactory\n声明一个全局的 CMTGatewayAPIFactory 实例即可，并调用 Initialize 一次就好了，它的作用是于创建 GatewayAPI 实例。\n2.4.3 、初始化 GatewayEventSink\n该类继承了 IMTGatewaySink ，用于处理 MT5 Trade Server 的连接情况。\n\n2.4.4 、创建 IMTGatewayAPI\n通过调用 CMTGatewayAPIFactory 的具体实例的 Create 方法创建 GatewayAPI 实例，要注意传参数\n2.4.5 、向 IMTGatewayAPI 发送报价数据\n当从股票行情数据源接收到实时成交报价时，例如从 AllTick 收到它推送的实时成交报价，则调用 GatewayAPI 的 SendTicks 方法向 MT5 Trade Server 发送成交报价\n当从股票行情数据源接收到实时盘口报价时，例如从 AllTick 收到它推送的实时盘口报价，则调用 GatewayAPI 的 SendBooks 方法向 MT5 Trade Server 发送盘口报价\n2.5 、部署\n部署的方式有两种：\n部署到 MT5 Trade Server 本地，然后在 MT5 Admin 平台上进行新增加数据源。\n外部独立部署，然后在 MT5 Admin 平台上进行新增加数据源。\n无论采用哪种方式结果是一样的，关于部署的细节，后续会再单独写篇文章来说明。",

          "description": "在我看来好像是个常识，不能经常充电，我一般在手机电量到 20 以下才会充电。但是突然想到，似乎又不那么应该，毕竟这个理论我听了很多年了，科技的发展即便影响也不应该到明显的地步。我问了 GPT 给我了一个很惊讶的回复，似乎频繁充电才是正确的。那么，有没有专业人士，它说的是正确的吗？\n手机电池的寿命确实会受到充电习惯的影响，但现代智能手机通常使用锂离子电池，这种电池比早期的镍镉（ NiCd ）和镍氢（ NiMH ）电池要更加耐用和高效。\n1. 以下几点可以帮助理解如何充电习惯影响电池寿命：\n\n2. 充电循环：锂离子电池的寿命以充电循环次数来衡量。一个充电循环指的是从 0%到 100%的充电过程或多个部分充电过程的总和达到 100%。随着充电循环次数的增加，电池容量会逐渐下降。\n\n3. 过度充电和过度放电：现代手机通常有防止过度充电和过度放电的保护机制，但保持电池在 20%-80%的区间内充电，可以延长电池寿命。长时间保持满电状态或完全放电都可能对电池产生负面影响。\n\n4. 高温和低温：极端温度对锂离子电池有害。避免在高温环境下充电或使用手机，也避免让手机在寒冷环境中长时间运行。\n\n5. 快充技术：虽然快充非常方便，但频繁使用快充功能可能会产生更多热量，从而加速电池老化。如果不急需快速充电，使用常规充电速度可能更好。\n\n总的来说，经常充电并不会显著缩短锂离子电池的寿命，但一些优化的充电习惯可以帮助延长电池的整体寿命。```",

          "description": "6月27日，暴雪魔兽世界国服停服520天后回归，《魔兽世界》中国官方微博宣布，魔兽世界怀旧服“巫妖王之怒”所有服务器现已开放。此外，魔兽世界正式服也将在8月1日重启，并于8月27日全球同步开启魔兽世界正式服地心之战的资料片。\n\r\n\r\n官方本月早些时候表示，6月27日至7月10日软启动期间，游戏时间将不会消耗，战网商城服务也将无法使用，服务器也将暂时处于锁定状态。7月10日将进行24小时的停服维护，维护完成后，怀旧服“巫妖王之怒”的所有服务就将完全重启，服务器限制也会解除。\n\r\n\r\n我虽然是主要玩《魔兽世界》正式服，但由于正式服还有一个月才上线，因此我就先体验一下这个先上线的怀旧服，玩了几天，感触颇深，下面是我的一点点体验。\n\r\n\r\n服务器硬件和网络体验\n\r\n\r\n我从广东连接魔兽世界怀旧服，显示怀旧服的延迟为23-27ms左右。\n\r\n\r\n我记得最后一次玩国服正式服的时候，延迟只有2、3ms，玩台服的时候，用了加速器，延迟也就20多ms，现在国服怀旧服重开，延迟和台服差不多，新的国服起码在网络延迟上，还是有一些优化空间的。\n\r\n\r\n希望国服正式服上线的时候，延迟能恢复到原来的2、3ms左右。\n\r\n\r\n升级过程体验差\n\r\n\r\n再说一下怀旧服的游戏体验吧，我从1级号开始练级，在有50%经验加成的基础上，从1级升级到80级需要130小时左右的时间。这期间，感觉到了游戏设计师满满的恶意，相比正式服，怀旧服的升级设计简直就是折腾人。\n\r\n\r\n明明可以有个飞行点，就是没有飞行点，从闪金镇到暴风城还要小跑过去，纯粹就是为了浪费玩家的时间。20级才能骑马，60级才能飞行，想想学习飞行需要的金币就头疼。\n\r\n\r\n金币抠抠搜搜就是不给你，学个骑术的3个金币都攒不到，学个专业技能都能把金币花光，对比正式服一个10秒钟简单任务就能赚500金币，对比太强烈了。\n\r\n\r\n怪物等级设计不合理，同等级小怪打起来都难的很，副本更是地狱难度，死亡次数太多了。更绝的是，在副本死后，需要在副本外跑尸，很多副本入口隐藏极深，很难找到入口。为了更多地浪费玩家的时间，设计师专门把副本的任务放在副本外面接，也在副本外面交。\n\r\n\r\n我练的牧师职业异常缺蓝，基本打一个小怪就能把蓝耗光，打一个怪就得坐下喝水回蓝，打一个怪，喝半分钟水，如果不小心add到第二个怪，通常就必死无疑，然后要走很长的路来跑尸，体验非常不好。\n\r\n\r\n在技能方面，怀旧服的很多职业重要技能给的太晚了，导致玩家在早期练级过程极其痛苦，很多技能无法使用，前三十级练级体验很差，之后的体验才慢慢变好。\n\r\n\r\n满级后体验变好\n\r\n\r\n80级满级以后，游戏体验是整个过程中最好的，从PVP和PVE两方面都体验不错。\n\r\n\r\n在PVP方面，国服战场PVP人数很多，2分钟就能排一个40人史诗战场，这在亚服是不可想象的，我在亚服一年多来，从来没有成功排进过1个40人史诗战场，哪怕就是十几个人的小战场，亚服也要15分钟以上才能排进去，而国服这种2分钟就能排一个战场的体验，完全碾压亚服的PVP战场体验。不足之处是PVP战场太少，只有五个PVP战场。\n\r\n\r\n在PVP平衡性方面，某些职业过于强势，职业的平衡性不如正式服，不少职业怀旧服和正式服的玩法大相径庭，例如戒律牧师在怀旧服和正式服几乎是两种完全不同的玩法。\n\r\n\r\n除了PVP，PVE在满级后体验也不错，虽然功能较少，但随机英雄副本基本上5分钟内都能进去，还算是不错的体验。\n\r\n\r\n在装备获取上，通过PVP的荣誉点数和PVE的英雄点数，都可以在短时间内换到不错的装备，让玩家在装备获取上较为轻松。\n\r\n\r\n不过，怀旧服的副本装备拾取机制非常不合理，导致玩家之间容易产生矛盾，绝大多数踢人都是因为装备拾取问题，这点正式服的装备拾取机制完全碾压怀旧服。\n\r\n\r\n结论\n\r\n\r\n怀旧服用户的主要设计特点，是为了更多消耗用户时间来弥补内容相对不足，因此设计出很多恶心人的套路来折腾用户，复杂的世界地图，极少的飞行点，让未满级的玩家痛苦不已，只有满级之后，体验才会慢慢好起来。\n\r\n\r\n正式服用户的主要设计特点是赛季模式，半年一个赛季，装备就会更替，装备和金币获取更容易，设计的主要方向也不再是消耗用户时间了，设计师把主要精力花在怎么让用户更爽，更容易续费的正确道路上。\n\r\n\r\n总之，怀旧服的装备获取难度，金币获取难度，都远远高于正式服，未接触过魔兽世界的新手玩家更应该选择正式服而不是怀旧服。",

          "description": "近日，百度旗下萝卜快跑已经于11个城市开放载人测试运营服务，并且在北京、武汉、重庆、深圳、上海开展全无人自动驾驶出行服务测试。\n\r\n\r\n天眼查App显示，“萝卜快跑”关联公司萝卜运力（北京）科技有限公司成立于2020年12月，法定代表人为毕然，注册资本1000万人民币，由百度2位副总裁李震宇、尚国斌共同持股。对外投资信息显示，该公司直接持股7家企业，其中6家为萝卜运力在各地的科技公司，包括深圳、武汉、合肥、广州等地。知识产权信息显示，该公司已成功注册了多枚“萝卜快跑”、“萝卜优跑”、“萝卜运力”“萝卜快飞”等商标。\n\r\n\r\n作为“人工智能”最前沿的应用之一，不少人认为萝卜快跑无人驾驶汽车正在颠覆和整顿出行市场。\n\r\n\r\n据悉，武汉市已经投入了1000辆萝卜快跑第六代无人驾驶骑车，虽然相比真人司机不够“灵活”，遇到行人、非机动车只会停车等待，但是很多打车出行的市民还是对其给出了好评。\n\r\n\r\n据报道，萝卜快跑累计拿下500万个订单，单车日均单量达到20单，已经和出租车日均单量接近。而且武汉市民对萝卜快跑的乘坐体验评价普遍较高，调查数据显示5分好评占比高达94.19%。\n\r\n\r\n有网友表示，萝卜快跑无人驾驶汽车“空气不臭，有空调，听自己想听的歌，没人打扰，干净”，还有网友表示“武汉真的很需要这种无人驾驶，司机汉骂飙车绕路真的巨烦”。\n\r\n\r\n更能打动人的是价格。4月份萝卜快跑曾推出过2折打车的活动，6公里的路程最低只需要0.8元，相比之下最便宜的滴滴特价拼车也要至少6.9元，经济型网约车一口价10.5元，萝卜快跑价格优势巨大，吸引了不少新用户加入。\n\r\n\r\n价格够低、车内干净舒适，让萝卜快跑成为了不少人的“心头好”。不过对于武汉的出租车、网约车司机来说，萝卜快跑正在威胁到他们的饭碗。有网约车司机表示，无人驾驶汽车对出行行业影响“蛮大的”，如果无人驾驶汽车大规模普及，很多从业者“可能就没饭吃了”，因为无人驾驶汽车成本低，还可以全天24小时运行，但是人开车不行。\n\r\n\r\n一些经常驾车出行的武汉市民也不太待见萝卜快跑无人驾驶汽车，因为其太过“死板”，“拐个弯都可以拐半天”，人类司机调头只需要一两分钟，无人驾驶汽车需要十几分钟，早晚高峰非常容易导致拥堵。\n\r\n\r\n随着萝卜快跑无人驾驶汽车越来越常见，公众对其安全性提出了担忧。7月7日，有网友发视频称汉阳区鹦鹉大道与国博大道交汇路口萝卜快跑无人驾驶汽车与一名行人发生轻微接触，百度方面回应称事故发生时绿灯亮起、车辆起步，行人闯红灯与车辆发生接触，所幸行人无明显外伤。\n\r\n\r\n不过从百度提供的驾驶数据来看，萝卜快跑无人驾驶汽车的安全性已经高于人类司机10倍以上。其安全行驶里程已经超过1亿公里，没有发生过一起重大安全事故，保险出险率仅为人类司机的四分之一。最基本的，无人驾驶汽车不会疲劳驾驶、酒驾、超速、闯红灯，光这几个原因引发的事故每年就接近20万起。\n\r\n\r\n从概率上来说，无人驾驶汽车肯定做不到100%不发生事故，但只要比人类司机事故率低的多就已经足够了。有人担忧无人驾驶汽车会失控，但反过来想，人类司机就一定情绪稳定吗？无人驾驶汽车已经成为新的风口，不少城市争相入局。除了武汉，重庆、北京、广州、上海等多个城市也在开展无人驾驶汽车的试点和推广工作。从这个角度看，无人驾驶汽车对出行行业的冲击还将继续扩大。\n\r\n\r\n网友表示，伴随无人驾驶的大面积普及，“五年后十年后，网约车、出租车基本都是无人驾驶的了，目前的网约车司机、出租车司机都得淘汰。”对于萝卜快跑被指抢网约车、出租车司机饭碗一事，截止发稿百度暂无回应。不过有内部人士透露称，目前百度对于投放于武汉等地的网约车数量并未明确公布，网传萝卜快跑已在武汉投放1000辆的说法暂时无法求证。\n\r\n\r\n来源：综合财联社、新浪科技、金融界汽车",

          "description": "据媒体报道，6月24日下午，苏州日本人学校的校车遭到了一名外来男子的袭击。这一次持刀伤人案件当中，一对日本的母子受伤。还有一个过去阻拦凶手的中国女子，也被砍成了重伤。\n\r\n\r\n对于这件事情，胡锡进发文发表了他的看法。首先胡锡进先是谴责了那个持刀伤人的凶手，说他这样的行为不仅违反法律，还破坏了中日友好的关系。所以不管怎么说，他都支持对凶手进行严惩，让凶手遭受法律的制裁。同时那个阻拦凶手行凶的中国女子应该是见义勇为，值得我们嘉奖。而且她的做法，也反映了绝大多数中国人的善良。在所有中国人当中，大多数人都是善良的，都是会见义勇为的。\n\r\n\r\n以下为胡锡进微博全文：\n\r\n\r\n\r\n老胡谴责苏州持刀伤人者，并有三点基本判断\n\r\n\r\n第一， 老胡谴责苏州发生的男子砍伤三人事件，无论嫌犯是出于什么目的，是不是故意要针对日本人犯罪，我都要谴责他。如果此人行凶针对的就是日本人，我要说，他的这种动机在中国社会中一定是遭唾弃的。互联网上有一些“反日情绪”，但这绝不代表我们的社会支持对在华日本人采取极端行动。绝大多数中国人不仅坚决支持捍卫法治，而且希望中日两国和平友好，加强各种交流与合作，对日本人在华工作、旅游、生活普遍持欢迎态度。而且我深信，这一态度的主流性不可撼动。\n\r\n\r\n第二， 老胡同意中国官方部门的判断，苏州发生的砍伤一对日本母子和一名校车上中国人的事件，它在中国社会总体上就是偶发的，吉林此前发生的一嫌犯刺伤多名美国人事件也是一样。即使这次行凶者是专门针对日本人，其作案动机的形成在中国庞大社会里也是极其零星的。在大秩序和对外国人普遍友好的态度中，这样的个例绝不具有某种代表性，它就是孤立的，是大环境中的偶然。所以在谴责这起作案的同时，不应当夸大它的意义。就像在其他国家和社会里，也都有受害者是外国人的案件发生，其中有个别是专门以外国人为目标一样。不能因为苏州出了这起事件，就做无边无际的延伸解读。\n\r\n\r\n这起事件中，校车上那名中国女子因阻止行凶，受了最重的伤，仍在抢救中。老胡认为，那名女子现场迸发的英勇阻止反映了绝大多数中国人的善良，以及我们对任何行凶的集体态度。\n\r\n\r\n最后老胡想对网友们说，我们大家要了解，目前中国与日本的关系相对紧张复杂，这个时候发生砍伤日本人的事件，比如果中日彼此关系好的时候，会产生更加敏感的效应。因此这个时候不仅法律会严惩凶犯，咱们大家也要在网上亮明我们社会对这一行凶的唾弃，那将有助于扩大国际上对我们社会里主流对外友好态度的了解，更加相信所发生的案件就是偶然的。\n\r\n\r\n\r\n警方通报“日本公民在苏州遇袭”:犯罪嫌疑人已被刑拘\n\r\n\r\n\r\n苏州市公安局苏州高新区分局发布警情通报：\n\r\n\r\n6月24日16时许，苏州高新区塔园路新地中心公交站台发生一起持刀伤人案件，造成3人受伤（其中1人为中国籍，2人为日本籍）。公安局巡逻警力第一时间到场处置，当场抓获犯罪嫌疑人周某某（男，52岁，为近期从外地来苏州无业人员），并立即将伤者送医救治。\n\r\n\r\n目前，中国籍伤者因在阻止嫌疑人犯罪过程中受伤严重，仍在抢救中；1名日本籍伤者正在治疗，无生命危险，另1名日本籍伤者当日已出院。周某某已被刑事拘留。案件侦办工作正在进一步开展中，将依法依规对犯罪行为予以严惩。",

          "description": "之前有博主在一家平价超市测试100元人民币到底能购买多少生活必需品，该视频引发网友热议，我也写过一篇“100元人民币的购买力”的文章，测试了100元人民币可以在深圳沃尔玛超市购买多少肉蛋奶产品，本篇文章将进一步测试，20美元可以在美国沃尔玛超市购买多少肉蛋奶产品。\n\r\n\r\n沃尔玛是美国最大的连锁超市之一，人们几乎能在这里买到生活所需的任何东西，包括食品、电子设备、家居用品、服装等。同时，沃尔玛售卖的商品都物美价廉且离市区较近，通常也是人们购买生活必需品的第一选择。\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n沃尔玛具有网上超市功能，在网上即可下单，我测试的是洛杉矶沃尔玛的商品价格，不同地区的价格可能不一样。我选择的是以肉蛋奶相关关键词搜索排名前列的商品价格，全都是畅销商品（Best seller），经过测试，20美元可以购买到2.27公斤大米，3.78升牛奶，18个鸡蛋，0.907公斤冷冻蔬菜，0.45公斤碎牛肉。\n\r\n\r\n下面是购买到的详细商品列表和价格。\n\r\n\r\n惠宜长粒强化大米，5磅（2.27公斤），3.52美元。\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n惠宜全脂牛奶，1加仑（3.78升），3.76美元。\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n惠宜无笼鸡蛋，18个，3.82美元。\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n惠宜冷冻蔬菜，32盎司（907克），2.76美元。\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n全天然（80%瘦肉/20%肥肉）碎牛肉，1磅（454克），5.37美元。\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n5件商品合计价格是19.23美元，折合140元人民币。\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n总的来说，从食物营养的角度来看，20美元在洛杉矶沃尔玛的购买力相当不错，一个人吃一周应该没问题，足以满足一个人的基本食品需求。",

          "description": "原文：Python Gotcha: strip, lstrip, rstrip can remove more than expected\n介绍\n作为一名软件工程师，你处理过不少脏字符串。删除用户输入中的前导或尾随空格可能是最常见的工作之一。\n在 Python 中，这是通过 .strip() 、 .lstrip() 或 .rstrip() 函数完成的，通常如下所示：\n>>> \"     Andrew Wegner     \".lower().strip()\n'andrew wegner'\n>>> \"     Andrew Wegner     \".lower().lstrip()\n'andrew wegner     '\n>>> \"     Andrew Wegner     \".lower().rstrip()\n'     andrew wegner'\n\n这非常简单，并且没有什么意外的事情发生。\n陷阱\n陷阱在于，这些函数中的每一个都可以接受一个要删除的字符列表。\n>>> \"Andrew Wegner\".lower().rstrip(\" wegner\")\n'and'\n\n发生了什么？为什么结果不只是：\n'andrew'\n\n解释\n再次仔细阅读文档中的这行说明：\nA list of characters\n不是字符串列表 (Not a list of strings.)。\nstr.rstrip([chars])\nReturn a copy of the string with trailing characters removed. The chars argument is a string specifying the set of characters to be removed. If omitted or None, the chars argument defaults to removing whitespace. The chars argument is not a suffix; rather, all combinations of its values are stripped.\nFrom Built-in Types — Python 3.12.4 documentation\n文档中已经明确并举例说明了这一行为及其含义。然而，对于新开发者来说，这是出乎意料的行为。毕竟，这些函数看起来都很直观。\n我的示例执行以下操作：",
