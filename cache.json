          "description": "Our bias is to always add more. More rules, more process, more code, more features, more stuff. Interdependencies proliferate, and gradually strangle us. Systems want to grow and grow, but without pruning, they collapse. Slowly, then spectacularly.\nWhen a piece of trash drifts across the beach, it is our duty to pick it up so the next person can enjoy a pristine shoreline. When a thousand pieces litter the beach, it is too late. We can only lament the landscape. That’s just how beaches are now.\nA good system is designed to be periodically cleared of cruft. It has a built-in counterbalance. Without this pressure, our bias drives us to add band-aid after band-aid, until the only choice is to destroy the whole system and start from scratch.\nWhy is it so much easier to add than to remove? Maybe because we attach our identity to what is visible. But there is a difference between the ornamentation that defines our style and the vestigial burdens we carry.\nRemember those who did the invisible work of removing. Their legacy was not to build a sand castle, but to care for the beautiful beach on which we play.",

          "description": "Hi! I wanted to share an open source API-compatible replacement for SQS. It's written in Go, distributes as a single binary, and uses SQLite for underlying storage.\nI wrote this because I wanted a queue with all the bells and whistles - searching, scheduling into the future, observability, and rate limiting - all the things that many modern task queue systems have.\nBut I didn't want to rewrite my app, which was already using SQS. And I was frustrated that many of the best solutions out there (BullMQ, Oban, Sidekiq) were language-specific.\nSo I made an SQS-compatible replacement. All you have to do is replace the endpoint using AWS' native library in your language of choice.\nFor example, the queue works with Celery - you just change the connection string. From there, you can see all of your messages and their status, which is hard today in the SQS console (and flower doesn't support SQS.)\nIt is written to be pluggable. The queue implementation uses SQLite, but I've been experimenting with RocksDB as a backend and you could even write one that uses Postgres. Similarly, you could implement multiple protocols (AMQP, PubSub, etc) on top of the underlying queue. I started with SQS because it is simple and I use it a lot.\nIt is written to be as easy to deploy as possible - a single go binary. I'm working on adding distributed and autoscale functionality as the next layer.\nToday I have search, observability (via prometheus), unlimited message sizes, and the ability to schedule messages arbitrarily in the future.\nIn terms of monetization, the goal is to just have a hosted queue system. I believe this can be cheaper than SQS without sacrificing performance. Just as Backblaze and Minio have had success competing in the S3 space, I wanted to take a crack at queues.\nI'd love your feedback!\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40837610\nPoints: 326\n# Comments: 86",

          "description": "I'm not a genius, nor do I believe I'm the absolute best at what I do.\nIt took me 30 years to realize that, no matter how good I am, networking often determines success. I'm in a career I don't enjoy, unable to move up or change, while others get jobs through connections. About 80% of my colleagues were hired this way, while a few of us got in by luck.\nNetworking seems to drive career advancement.\nI'm naturally a loner and find it hard to feign interest in others' lives. I prefer spending time alone and struggle to genuinely connect with people.\nEmotional intimacy drains me, and I dread future interactions, even though I know this is normal.\nWhile I'm okay being alone, I feel that relationships are crucial for progress after a certain point.\nI even broke up with my partner because I can't handle constant companionship. It was so draining that I stopped enjoying sexual intimacy.\nI'm fine without a partner; I don't want to subject anyone to my solitude. However, I want to change careers, and I know connections are vital.\nI'm feeling stuck and unsure how to move forward. It seems the two crucial factor (luck and networking) are outside my influence.\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40833149\nPoints: 18\n# Comments: 13",

          "description": "Hi HN! I've posted Pickcode a few times (most recently https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38365638), but we've improved things quite a bit so I thought it was worth posting again. This is a bit of 1.0 release after a long year of working on the company full time!\nPickcode is basically Replit-lite, for kids. The editor is simple: text editor + output console + big green button to run your code. We support Python, HTML/CSS/JS, Java, and our block/text hybrid language, Pickcode VL.  We're partners on code.org's Hour of Code, and hundreds of thousands of students have tried our free stuff through them.\nAn account for individual kids is totally free, and we offer some free Python and Pickcode VL lessons to get them started. We make money by selling licenses to schools for better customer support and roster/lesson management features.\nYou can use this demo account I made to try out the editor:\n  email: demo@student.pickcode.io\n  pw: Demo1234\n\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40831904\nPoints: 28\n# Comments: 7",

The best way to get started is with the docs - https://r2r-docs.sciphi.ai/introduction.\nThis is a major update from our V1 which we have spent the last 3 months intensely building after getting a ton of great feedback from our first Show HN (https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39510874). We changed our focus to building a RAG engine instead of a framework, because this is what developers asked for the most. To us this distinction meant working on an opinionated system instead of layers of abstractions over providers. We built features for multimodal data ingestion, hybrid search with reranking, advanced RAG techniques (e.g. HyDE), automatic knowledge graph…",

It crashes sometimes still on mobile devices.\nI wasn't able to take photogrammetry photos of the artifacts from the tomb in the Museo Egizio in Turin because they were traveling while I was there (and now the museum is closed to install a new roof anyhow), so I tried to include comparanda from other museums where I had scanned artifacts.\nI tested the same dataset with 3d Gaussian Splatting but that had lower resolution results for great complexity in frontend code and reduced performance on older devices.

          "description": "After 13 years in SWE, working for startups, bigger companies, the golden handcuffs, etc, I can finally say that I think I'm finished.\nRight now I'm contracting to stay afloat, maintain flexibility and delve into entrepreneurship, but I truly don't know what the future holds for me anymore if building my own company doesn't work out. I have 0 inclination to go back to a 9-5 at a company coding for a living. I'm done. I've been an EM, which might arguably be the most miserable position that exists. I've been senior/staff at places, and honestly I just don't enjoy arguing about the structure of software anymore, I'm tired of the personalities, tired of the infantilization of the industry (frankly, it's embarrassing) but mostly, I just don't enjoy coding as much as I used to, unless I'm leveraging it to create an asymmetrical amount of value for me ($$$$) which is just not what a full time job is.\nHowever, I don't know what to look into as an alternative if I need a full time position once my wife and I start having kids. My strengths revolve around people and strategy. I've been considering sales at a tech company because to me, working harder and having an unlimited cap in what I can earn sounds pretty fantastic.\nWould love to hear any kinds of stories or tips from folks\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40780940\nPoints: 95\n# Comments: 41",

          "description": "Hey HN! I've built this cli tool to manage env variables of a project, but mostly for fun and to try out Rust and the clap crate.\nI had this idea when I made a big mistake and broke some production stuff because I had a very messy .env file laying around in my project.\nI was implementing new features for one of my projects and in my .env file I had the test database url commented out and the production one was not. Long story short, I applied migrations to the production database instead of my local test one and broke a lot of production APIs :')\nI wanted a tool that could easily help me spot these issues before something bad happened, and so I built envelope for that reason.\nInstead of a \\.env(\\..+)? file, I now use this tool to add variables to different configurations: dev, prod etc. and I feed them to the program I am executing on a one liner.\n  $ envelope init\n  $ envelope add dev db_url localhost:5432/postgres\n  $ envelope add dev db_username username\n  $ envelope add dev db_pwd pwd\n  $ export $(envelope list dev)\n  $ ./run.sh\n\nA very useful feature that I use quite a lot is the `check` command which is going to tell you which environment you have currently active\n  $ export $(envelope list dev)\n  $ envelope check\n  > dev\n\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40758703\nPoints: 61\n# Comments: 34",

          "description": "This is the first iteration of a short game I’m making that tries to interactively explain some of my favorite math questions / ideas. My goal is mostly to get the player curious and not necessarily to explain absolutely everything.\nThere were a lot of fun technical parts to building this:\n- For implementation reasons, it’s much easier if the lines all have integer intersection points with each other. To do this, when a new line is added I “cheat” by rounding intersections to integers and then splitting the old lines at the intersection into new linds (with potentially different slopes) going through the rounded point\n- I had to draw semi accurate maps of actual places (UK, South America, US west coast) in the HTML canvas using just line segments. I tried a few different solutions, including using SVG data. I ended up using the topojson library to give nice line approximations to GeoJSON maps\n- I use a simple backtracking algorithm to handle the live coloring of graphs\n- I use turf.js’s polygonize function to handle finding polygons from line segments (very happy I didn’t have to implement this myself!)\n- I wanted to make the game as mobile friendly as possible (don’t think I’ve nailed this quite yet)\nThere were also a few tradeoffs I made:\n- I wanted give links earlier in the game for players to learn more, but I decided to wait until the end to maintain the flow of the game\n- In order to make the game more mobile-friendly, I generally stuck to maps with a small number of regions (at least for maps people have to interact with them). So for the most part all of the instances in the game are “easy”\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40740021\nPoints: 411\n# Comments: 93",

          "description": "This is the third camera I've designed/made around the raspberry pi parts/ecosystem.\nThe repo has all the STL files, parts list, most wiring diagrams. The first one was the custom Pi Zero HQ cam which was featured on a Hackaday article/podcast.\nThe modular version (aside from being able to swap cameras) mostly has the latest software. Recently I added the ability to process videos in the background (ffmpeg merges wav/mp4 files together).\nThe camera uses crop-zoom-panning for dialing in shots with manual lenses. The menu is created by layering images/text with PIL. Live preview is a little slow as it's SPI based.\nIf anybody is a pro at python I'd appreciate insight on better code. I've mostly just followed a context-based folder layout regarding where everything is.\nI have not added custom/manual settings yet, it uses auto settings for the most part except for when you use a V3 camera module (which has electronic aperture) then it uses the d-pad to set the focus/diopter value.\nI have another camera in mind/future build although it's more tailored for videos.\nSome sample video I've shot.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkjXkQD0j9w\nAssembly video\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dXG-MoIw93Q\nAt some point I will rewrite the code for a new general purpose DIY camera software from what I've learned, that'll be an undertaking.\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40730245\nPoints: 34\n# Comments: 15",

          "description": "Hello HN!\nHere's Billard. It combines music and physics into a unique creative tool, as I explore various unconventional methods for generating music.\nMost traditional music composition tools revolve around the idea of a repeatable pattern.\nBillard is a webapp that never repeats itself. It generates music automatically based on the collisions of balls in a 2D space. Collisions trigger notes (or chords) in a given key. One can add balls or move them (y-position is pitch); the app remembers its state between reloads; or it can be reset with the 'init' button on the top left. Gravity can be adjusted in real time to change the behavior of the balls.\nIt owes a lot of inspiration to Brian Eno and Erik Satie (inventor of musique d'ameublement, or \"furniture music\"). Some may think the lack of pattern makes it not musical enough -- but this lets it be listened to —and watched— for a while without boredom.\nThe webapp is made using plain JavaScript. (All SVG icons were made 'by hand'.) It uses Tone.js only for triggering piano samples. Beyond piano, it's MIDI-enabled and works well at slow speed with haunting, dark synth sounds.\nHope you like it!\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40719782\nPoints: 134\n# Comments: 41",

          "description": "Hey HN! Tokencost is a utility library for estimating LLM costs. There are hundreds of different models now, and they all have their own pricing schemes. It’s difficult to keep up with the pricing changes, and it’s even more difficult to estimate how much your prompts and completions will cost until you see the bill.\nTokencost works by counting the number of tokens in prompt and completion messages and multiplying that number by the corresponding model cost. Under the hood, it’s really just a simple cost dictionary and some utility functions for getting the prices right. It also accounts for different tokenizers and float precision errors.\nSurprisingly, most model providers don't actually report how much you spend until your bills arrive. We built Tokencost internally at AgentOps to help users track agent spend, and we decided to open source it to help developers avoid nasty bills.\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40710154\nPoints: 40\n# Comments: 14",

          "description": "Hello HN!  First a quick background of what I am trying to search.\nIn 1983, Logo Computer Systems, Inc. (LCSI) published two popular versions of Logo.  One was meant to be run on Atari systems and the other was meant to be run on IBM PCs.\nThe manuals and documentation for the Atari LCSI Logo are very well archived on the world wide web.  The two I am particularly interested in are here:\nA) Atari Logo Reference Manual: https://atariwiki.org/wiki/attach/Logo/Atari%20LOGO%20Reference%20Manual.pdf\nB) Atari Logo Introduction to Programming Through Turtle Graphics: https://atariwiki.org/wiki/attach/Logo/Atari%20LOGO%20Introduction%20To%20Programing%20Through%20Turtle%20Graphics%20%281-sided%29.pdf\nOn page 3 of the first document (9th page in the PDF), there is a reference to the second document:\n> First time Logo users should start with the companion manual Introduction to Programming Through Turtle Graphics.\nHowever, sadly, the manuals for IBM LCSI Logo does not seem to be easily available.  I found the following:\nC) IBM Personal Computer Logo Reference: https://archive.org/download/ibm_logo_manual/ibm_logo_manual.pdf\nIt too has a reference to an introductory documentation:\n> The purpose of the IBM Personal Computer Logo Reference is to give you a thorough understanding of the many features of Logo by expanding the information contained in Logo: Programming with Turtle Graphics, which comes with IBM Personal Computer Logo.\nHowever, I have not been able to find a copy of this document anywhere.  Do you know any place I can get hold of a copy of the document titled \"Logo: Programming with Turtle Graphics\" that is meant to be used with IBM/LCSI PC Logo?\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40691792\nPoints: 26\n# Comments: 4",

Check out our clickthrough demo here: https://app.storylane.io/share/qyayvtamapis.\nOverwatch began when we were working with risk and threat intel teams at Google, Stripe, and government. We experienced the immense challenge every fraud and cyber threat analyst faces: manually parsing through an ocean of data to find valuable insights and filter out the noise. This included using many of the feeds and tools out there that were often very expensive, noisy, keyword-based, and lacked accurate entity extraction or advanced query features.\nMost threat intelligence tools utilize thousands of keywords and teams of analysts to ma…",

          "description": "We'd love to share our work with you: Restate, a system for workflows-as-code (durable execution). With SDKs in JS/Java/Kotlin and a lightweight runtime built in Rust/Tokio.\nhttps://github.com/restatedev/\nhttps://restate.dev/\nIt is free and open, SDKs are MIT-licensed, runtime permissive BSL (basically just the minimal Amazon defense).\nWe worked on that for a bit over a year. A few points I think are worth mentioning:\n- Restate's runtime is a single binary, self-contained, no dependencies aside from a durable disk. It contains basically a lightweight integrated version of a durable log, workflow state machine, state storage, etc. That makes it very compact and easy to run both on a laptop and a server.\n- Restate implements durable execution not only for workflows, but the core building block is durable RPC handlers (or event handler). It adds a few concepts on top of durable execution, like virtual objects (turn RPC handlers into virtual actors), durable communication, and durable promises. Here are more details: https://restate.dev/programming-model\n- Core design goal for APIs was to keep a familiar style. An app developer should look at Restate examples and say \"hey, that looks quite familiar\". You can let us know if that worked out.\n- Basically every operation (handler invocation, step, ...) goes through a consensus layer, for a high degree of resilience and consistency.\n- The lightweight log-centric architecture gives Restate still good latencies: For example around 50ms roundtrip (invoke to result) for a 3-step durable workflow handler (Restate on EBS with fsync for every step).\nWe'd love to hear what you think of it!\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40659160\nPoints: 125\n# Comments: 100",

          "description": "Hey folks! Mike here. Francois Chollet and I are launching ARC Prize, a public competition to beat and open-source the solution to the ARC-AGI eval.\nARC-AGI is (to our knowledge) the only eval which measures AGI: a system that can efficiently acquire new skill and solve novel, open-ended problems. Most AI evals measure skill directly vs the acquisition of new skill.\nFrancois created the eval in 2019, SOTA was 20% at inception, SOTA today is only 34%. Humans score 85-100%. 300 teams attempted ARC-AGI last year and several bigger labs have attempted it.\nWhile most other skill-based evals have rapidly saturated to human-level, ARC-AGI was designed to resist “memorization” techniques (eg. LLMs)\nSolving ARC-AGI tasks is quite easy for humans (even children) but impossible for modern AI. You can…",

          "description": "Hey HN,\nAs a Software Engineer, I frequently copy and paste content. The fact that macOS clipboard buffer can keep only one item is very frustrating. It’s very annoying to copy → switch app → paste → switch app → copy → switch app → paste, and so on. Losing items I copied hours ago and having to find and copy them again is a waste of time.\nI tried many third-party clipboard managers like Alfred, Raycast, Paste, Maccy, etc. While great, they didn't fully meet my needs.\nAs a developer, my requirements are:\n1. Keyboard-centric operation to avoid using the mouse. I don’t want to waste my time moving my hands from the keyboard.\n2. Display many clipboard history items at once. I don’t like the idea with big tiles, so I can see only 5-7 history items on my 32” monitor.\n3. Full content preview for each clipboard item.\n4. Quick search functionality.\nSo, I created ClipBook for my own use. After months of development, daily use, and positive feedback from my colleagues, I decided to share it publicly. It’s free. All data is securely stored on your computer. I’m planning to make it open source as well.\nIf you try it out, please let me know if you found it useful, if you have anything you’d like me to add, or if you have any other feedback.\nHappy to answer any questions. Much appreciated.\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40648404\nPoints: 36\n# Comments: 21",

          "description": "Hey HN, we're building Thread (https://thread.dev/) an open-source Jupyter Notebook that has a bunch of AI features built in. The easiest way to think of Thread is if the chat interface of OpenAI code interpreter was fused into a Jupyter Notebook development environment where you could still edit code or re-run cells. To check it out, you can see a video demo here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jq1_eoO6w-c\nWe initially got the idea when building Vizly (https://vizly.fyi/) a tool that lets non-technical users ask questions from their data. While Vizly is powerful at performing data transformations, as engineers, we often felt that natural language didn't give us enough freedom to edit the code that was generated or to explore the data further for ourselves. That is what gave us the inspiration to start Thread.\nWe made Thread a pip package (`pip install thread-dev`) because we wanted to make Thread as easily accessible as possible. While there are a lot of notebooks that improve on the notebook development experience, they are often cloud hosted tools that are hard to access as an individual contributor unless your company has signed an enterprise agreement.\nWith Thread, we are hoping to bring the power of LLMs to the local notebook development environment while blending the editing experience that you can get in a cloud hosted notebook. We have many ideas on the roadmap but instead of building in a vacuum (which we have made the mistake of before) our hope was to get some initial feedback to see if others are as interested in a tool like this as we are.\nWould love to hear your feedback and see what you think!\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40633773\nPoints: 75\n# Comments: 28",

It is a powerful Photoshop-like editor that speeds up comic creation 10x with AI. The editor provides consistency and granular artistic control.

I have my A+ and Sec+ so there was some familiarity with these topics. There was a post on this community that said it’s a good test to take for broadening understanding of various OSs and computers in general.\n My background is predominantly military and emergency services. \n Hopefully this post helps other people on the fence with taking it. Here’s what I did to pass: \n -Printed off the exam objectives from comp tia. \n -made a 3x5 flashcard for every topic using GPT4 to define the topics and relate the topics to windows OS. I made over 600 flashcards this week. ($20)\n -Used an app called IT security to drill questions. It gave me a question deck of 500 questions I paid for this service and answered all 500 questions. ($20)\n I had a raspberry pi as my Linux computer that I would run commands through and learn how the commands work. ($100)\n I can say that I will never use Linux at work since I work in an environment that will never leave windows OS. My understanding of OSs (even windows) is better now and I’m really glad I took this cert. \n    submitted by    /u/Amilliontoads  \n [link]   [comments]",

But eftbootdude is easier to install (if not in your distro's repo), is more transparent about what it is doing, and tries to report the mount point or device path of each boot loader (to make clean-up easier).\n To try if you wish ... install efibootmgr (if needed), pipx (if needed), and finally run pipx install efibootdude to install.

It looks like this:\n efibootdude v0.5 screenshot\n efibootdude runs well on the systems I've tried (using python11 and python12), but there are a lot of weird BIOSes out there ;-) But, if not working so well for you, create an issue, say, provide the \"raw\" output of efibootmgr, your motherboard/BIOS, and a problem description so I can either generalize or add your case to the caveats ;-) Cheers.\n    submitted by    /u/ZetaZoid  \n [link]   [comments]",

I hope it's not too out of place.\n My dad was a huge linux geek(and computer fan in general) in the early days that it came out. It was his passion in life that he made into a successful career. So much so that while other fathers and sons were playing catch, he was showing me how to use Linux and Unix. I have many great memories of me and him bonding in front of a bash shell. I remember him telling everyone he saw(regardless of if they knew about linux or not) and acting like the proudest father alive when he taught me something as easy as how to cd into a directory when I was 6.\n I remember him religiously collecting stuffed penguins to add to his computer desk. There was a point where he had 10 scattered around and my mom complained that the work area was more penguin than desk. He was a goofy guy who managed to transfer his passions to me.\n Unfortunately, He got diagnosed with an early and aggressive form of dementia(frontotemporal) and ended up not being able to use computers anymore. He's been declining for years now and I've seen him go from the smartest person I've ever known to having the brain capacity of a newborn. He entered hospice two days ago and isn't expected to last much longer. Even through all of the deterioration, He still loves his stuffed penguin and has to have it near.\n I wanted to thank the community for always indulging him and sharing his same passion. This community was always the one that was the kindest to the goofy and eccentric guy who was my father. Truth be told, I can't even look at Linux right now without breaking down. I will in time though.\n    submitted by    /u/MyceliumJoe  \n [link]   [comments]",

The hardware is simply a modern descendant of workstation terminals. It is, for all intents and purposes, a \"terminal\".\n A younger friend insists that this hardware interface is an emulator using graphics and such, and the 'command line program' is a separate application of its own… Did I miss something?

          "description": "This week, we lost one of the great minds of our generation. Daniel dedicated the last 14 years of his life to creating an academic model for real-time threading. This work eventually led to the Linux Kernel runtime verification (RV), providing a practical use case for these models. He authored RTLA (Realtime Latency Analysis tool) that provides analysis of real-time performance and debugging based on models generated from RV. This marked a revolutionary approach to kernel debugging that relied on BPF and tracers to build live models of the current system state, as opposed to the historical method of black-box statically generated system states (i.e., kernel dumps and trace-cmd). \n While his work focused on real-time models, RV's reach expanded to general models of the stock Linux kernel (PREEMPT RT disabled) and successfully replaced tools like trace-cmd and, in some use cases, kdump. Today, I want to not only mourn the kernel legend that he had become but also the man himself. I had the honor of working with him, and the joy he brought into each and every room cannot be overstated. He blended a unique combination of compassion and genius that is rarely seen in the field of computer science, particularly at the level he reached. I will forever miss our casual fireside chats, our light-hearted debates about the best Prosecco drinks, and much, much more. RIP Daniel, you will be deeply missed by everyone in the community.\n    submitted by    /u/bootlesscrowfairy  \n [link]   [comments]",

So, I figured Linux Mint would be perfect for that.\n Well, I booted up the USB stick and it actually came up quicker than the Windows Login came up. Meaning, USB Flash drive booted Linux Mint quicker than the hard drive booted the login manager for Windows 10.\n So, I got to looking around in the laptop to figure out what he had in it and then…",

          "description": "We're all familiar with the use of 'dd' to write installers, the good old\n sudo dd if=installer.img of=/dev/sda2 bs=1M status=progress \n dance. It works, but it's not great:\n  \nThe progress info doesn't show progress as a percentage, nor does it calculate an ETA, it just shows bytes written.\n dd's default block size is a bad fit for most modern systems, hence the bs= parameter.\n It's easy to forget status=progress, and including it every time is a bit annoying.\n  \nNow, dd doesn't do anything special: it just reads from one file and writes to another. Tools like pv and cat could do the exact same thing. The only reason people really use dd for this purpose is that you can run dd as root, whereas redirecting the output of cat or pv requires running the shell itself as root. sudo dd ... is more terse than sudo sh -c 'cat ...'.\n A few weeks ago, I got annoyed with dd and implemented a --output option to the excellent tool called pv (\"Pipe Viewer\"). This meant that I could write images using sudo pv -o /dev/sda2 ... instead of using dd.\n Well, a week ago, PV released version 1.8.10 which contains my --output feature! Once your distribution updates to the latest version, you too can use pv instead of dd. Here are some advantages:\n  \npv shows an actual progress bar and an ETA, rather than just bytes written.\n pv automatically detects optimal buffer sizes.\n pv is more terse, since there is no need to specify status=progress or bs=....\n  \nTo ue pv instead of dd, simply run:\n sudo pv installer.img -Yo /path/to/block/device \n (The -Y is useful because it causes pv to sync after every write. This avoids the issue where the transfer hangs for a long time at 100% as buffers are flushed to the drive. -Yo is a nice mnemonic to remember :))\n Screenshot\n    submitted by    /u/mort96  \n [link]   [comments]",

Due to this frustration, I decided I would try to do something about it which led me down the rabbit hole of hybrid graphics.\n Traditionally, hybrid graphics is used on laptops for power-saving reasons. The laptop uses the iGPU for lightweight workloads and offloads to the dGPU when necessary. That said, there's no reason why we shouldn't be able to do the same on desktop.\n After about 3 hours of trial and error, bios tweaking, driver installation, tinkering with /etc/environment and /etc/profile and even tweaking some kernel modules, I succeeded.

          "description": "On Linux AFAIK the only filesystems (for consumer use) that have transparent disk compression are zfs, btrfs, bcachefs - all of which are CoW. The 'regular' fs options like ext4/xfs lack this feature. (f2fs has compression but its disabled and you won't see any space saved)\n There should be no technical reason why something as simple as compression should be tied to CoW/snapshot capability. Its simply (de)compressing data as its written/read. e.g. NTFS on Windows does this.\n Is there a reason for this apart from historical? e.g etx4 and xfs are both quite old - xfs predates Linux in fact. Perhaps no one has felt the need to add this feature to them because alternatives exist?\n This is a real shame because with modern cpus and lzo/zstd, compression can make a real difference not only in space saved but ssd/hdd health, and there's no way to use it with the most used default fs on desktop (ext4) or server (xfs).\n    submitted by    /u/ECrispy  \n [link]   [comments]",

I haven't really done a careful research in order to choose a distro, I just found Ubuntu Budgie and flashed into my desktop PC. I was really surprised, I expected Linux to be overwhelming and complicated, but it really wasn't, and in fact I have more fun using Linux than Windows 11.\n Then I went to  and I tried to rice my poor Budgie and I ended up making up a mess. But no problem I didn't have important files or sensitive data, so in order to fix everything I went on another distro, Xubuntu.\n I have been using Xubuntu since the 3rd of June, and so far I've been enjoying it, I noticed that I'm relying less and less on the file explorer and more on the terminal, I love using the terminal.\n A distro that caught my eye btw, was Arch. Not only because you can rice endlessly and customize how you want, but because I like seeing people using it. It looks minimalistic, simple and efficient. I also did some research on the AUR and how it keeps packages up to date better than APT on ubuntu.\n I also heard that using Arch will teach you how an OS works more in-depth, and since computer science interests me I think it would be a good source of learning.\n With that said I want to clarify what do I use and what is my purpose :\n I have 12GB of RAM, AMD RX 580, I use my PC mainly for browsing, productive work such as programming, taking notes, coding etc... I do little to no gaming and I'm really curious about learning new stuff in the OS, GNU/Linux world.\n Tell what should I know before installing Arch, advices , tips, feel free to interact and thanks in advance !\n    submitted by    /u/DonCABASH  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I've always loved Linux. Even before I fully switched, I was largely using Debian in WSL. Since I have switched though, I've heard a concerning large amount of people complain that whenever they post a question on a forum, particularly about arch btw, they tend to get answers telling them to read the f*cking manual. I find this interesting, because I actually disagree that this is a problem - if anything I would say it's a good thing. The issue is, new Linux users often post questions about common problems before even spending more than a minute searching Google, which causes a huge amount of duplicate posts all asking the same question, when they could have already found a number of people with the same issue online. This significantly brings down the quality of these forums, especially when many distributions have some truly amazing documentation - but for what, if nobody reads it? I think it's perfectly fine to ask something online on a forum, but only if you've first actually tried solving it yourself actively for more than 10 minutes.\n Change my view.\n (i use arch btw)\n EDIT: Typo fix\n    submitted by    /u/JakeStBu  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "The main selling point of rolling release distros used to be:\n  \nYou get the latest userland, hence you track the latest features and bug fixes from upstream \n You get the latest kernel, thus you get the latest support for new hardware\n  \nThese days, however, loads of userland developers are releasing their software via Flatpak/Snap/Appimage, and if not, you'll be sure it's packaged in Nix, which boasts the largest number of packaged software, even beyond the AUR. It's therefore possible to get the latest upstream release even if you're on, let's say, Debian Ancient Stable.\n On top of that, even \"LTS\" releases of non-rolling distros provide up-to-date kernels these days. Ubuntu, for example, provides their hardware enablement stack, which is enabled by default, meaning that even if you stick with an LTS release you still get the latest kernel every 6 months when the non-LTS release does their kernel freeze.\n What, then, remains for the rolling distros from the perspective of the consumer-user? I understand that a dev may want to track an environment where where library is at the latest release, but for regular users this doesn't seem to be a viable use case.\n    submitted by    /u/JockstrapCummies  \n [link]   [comments]",

Removing background noise from my mic based on a noise profile, it's so perfect, it works so perfectly! https://github.com/lucianodato/noise-repellent\n It is basically a replacement to reafir substract mode. It can get your noise profile, which should just be background noise, and remove it.\n I find this to be a lot more straightforward to do on Windows, for now, at least based on the way I do it currently. On Linux, Carla can look overwhelming, it was actually easier and faster to me but it does look much worse.\n Anyways, an amazing Linux win here. Only problem? Not a single tutorial tells you about this. Not a single source. I figured this out on my own, I mean google told me about noise repellent (prompt: linux reafir) but I figured out on my own that this confusing tutorial on reaplugs on linux I saw a thousand years ago used carla and I said \"maybe Carla helps\" without knowing a single thing about it, and I figured it out from there. Easyeffects also helped because their plugin showed up in Carla and I used it as guidance.\n Loving noise repellent. Wonderful work, and I guess it's smarter because it prefers to reduce noise instead of completely remove it (you can still remove it). I don't know if that's smarter.\n IMPORTANT: If you use Carla and maybe Ardour, your noise profile won't be saved. You need to build it yourself and merge pull request #119. Also, if you break easyeffects like I did, just reset the settings. Also, maybe keep a clean profile of carla saved in case you break something\n I hope there is an easier way to implement this, if not now in the future. Currently, I can't find it if I tell google \"linux remove background noise\", it only tells me of RNNoise and alternatives which work so badly in my case I rather not use it\n    submitted by    /u/patopansir  \n [link]   [comments]",

But it's still cool I can SSH in to my little single board computer, run a single command, and turn the monitor off.\n Also, this is persistent. So, if you want to turn the monitor back on, you need to run this:  xrandr --output HDMI-1 --mode \"1920x1080\" --display :0 \n Beat that, Windblows.\n    submitted by    /u/Batcastle3  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Recently the new version of Porteus Kiosk (v6.0) included a mandatory subscription to be used (40euro per client per year), previosly you just needed to keep automatic updates disabled and no subscription was needed, today you CANNOT disable automatic updates to avoid a subscription.\n Okay, GPL allows products to be have a fee, but I couldn't find any sources available for this distro. Is that okay?\n Also the previous versions had an online check when being installed that was disabled, and now I cannot install the previous versions, which again sounds like a violation of GPL, since I cannot use the software that I previously could.\n So, is Porteus abusing GPL? Is there anything that can be done? Is anyone affected by those issues already working on a patch (either to make the previous versions usable again, or making the new version works without the subscription of automatic updates)?\n    submitted by    /u/zhouluyi  \n [link]   [comments]",

If anyone is aware of such a program, I'd appreciate the recommendation.\n \nOLED care software for laptops: This isn't a dealbreaker, but it would be a nice quality-of-life feature to have software that can dim static elements or shift the screen image to prevent burn-in on OLED laptop displays (in my case a Asus Vivobook).\n \n Despite these concerns, I'm still excited about the prospect of using Linux as my primary operating system, and I hope the community continues to address these issues.

Its esp good for parallel workloads and almost everything on a modern desktop is like that. The only perf concern I read about is it used to have higher cpu usage for updating metadata but I believe thats been fixed and no longer relevant?\n (I think for most users, performance in benchmarks may not be noticeable and other features matter more, but its still an important consideration)\n SSD/OS installs - XFS is almost as fast as f2fs for these.

Every time I saw people share their experience, they seem to get used to Linux VERY fast and have almost no frustrations with it, or they just stop using Linux immediately because it was too frustrating for them. It made it really hard to figure out just how viable Linux was for me. I wanted to record my experience with Linux and thought I'd share it at the same time while I was at it.\n For context, I'm using a Framework 16 with the AMD 7700S graphics card in the expansion bay. I chose Linux Mint Cinnamon Edge since from my research, it seemed to be the most handholdy version of Linux to help me transition from Windows to Linux. The edge version is chosen because the Framework 16 is relatively new a…",

Turns out my laptop is working fine and it's Windows that's becoming usable. I'm so glad I gave Linux a try, otherwise I'd have to buy a new laptop, which would be both a waste of money and perfectly good laptop. \n My setup was horrible.

Plus after using windows for a bit my laptop fans were starting to get annoyingly loud with all the useless stuff open in the background.\n I've used Linux before but never seriously used it as a daily and it was always a dual boot. This time i just full on wiped my SSD and installed manjaro and i have to say it's been amazing. I was literally running a VM with a full operating system and running chrome with a ton of tabs open plus running vscode with a project open and my fan wasnt even on!! It was amazing. Plus for development purposes this has just been amazing . Gaming has also been really good with protondb, with most games simply starting from steam. without much/any tinkering and my 3050 hasn't had any issues so far.\n For anyone considering jumping ship just do it. Honestly the experience has been amazing and very user friendly. While i wouldnt call myself a linux noob, i believe a simple youtube tutorial and anyone could be up and running in little time.\n    submitted by    /u/LogTiny  \n [link]   [comments]",

Out of curiosity, I separated a small partition so that I could test whether I could even install it and use it for a few days, and a day later I decided to format my entire second drive (~500gb) on which I only had a few games and so far I have no reason to go back to Windows! Really, every application I wanted to go/install worked, there are so many guides and videos on YouTube explaining how to do various things.\n I can understand that some people may not like the fact that sometimes you have to type something into the console, but for me it's not a big deal to learn a dozen commands. I really see that this is a great community and the openness of the system is wonderful!\n I even told a friend to take a look at Linux, but he's not too interested, even after I showed him that it's a really cool system. However, I understand him, no one likes change if they feel comfortable.\n I really think that there is almost no effort (even Arch, which I installed , people said it might be quite difficult for a first Linux, but I really don't feel it)!\n I wanted to write my story and say Hello to the great community, I'm glad I found myself here!

After a short search i found out hundreds of different threads and articles recommending stow for managing dotfiles, even for my specific scenario - using it with Ansible.\n After trying to use it and checking it's man pages i found out that while it looks great, in real life scenario is completely useless for managing dotfiles:\n Lets say i am setting up a new computer and i want to sync my config from Syncthing. Before running a stow, i need to manually mv the sync'd config (because there are already files like ZSH or GTK config in my home folder) from the Syncthing to my home folder, then adapt it in stow and only then i can play with stow. The thing is, that once i already mv my sync'd config to a new home folder, i no longer need stow. Of course there are cases where the saved config changes and i want to sync it with other machines, but those configs are not changing that often, besides if i have an Ansible script which is mv my saved config to live home folder, i can just run it again? Seems that stow here is just an additional step, which at the end of the day is completely unnecessary? Or am i missing something/designed a bad workflow?\n    submitted by    /u/Dinth  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Some time ago I heard that GNOME started to work on a new Wayland-centric accessibility stack called Newton. The latest mention of it on GNOME's website is from This Week in GNOME #148 \"Variable Styles\" which was published on May 17 this year. Are there any new updates or developments about Newton?\n I snooped around GNOME's GitLab and apparently only one person named Matt Campbell is actively working on Newton, the creator of Newton. There's still relatively new commits, but I'm not really good at reading code so I'm not exactly sure what's the latest changes that landed on Newton's codebase. However I salute their work and I hope more developers would join them in development.\n    submitted by    /u/IverCoder  \n [link]   [comments]",

I decided I wanted to learn about 'hacking' without a computer and that's when I discovered termux a linux emulator on android.\n I didn't even care I downloaded scripts when I saw a term for a person like me (script kiddie ) I decided I didn't have to be looked down upon. then I saw Kali Linux but I couldn't do anything since I didn't have a laptop and my parents thought it was 'useless' for a highschooler . I decided to learn about Linux, python and C while still using a phone although it was hard.\n After sometime I found it hard to concentrate on two things so I left termux for my studies and after finishing highschool I got my laptop. The second day I installed Debian since termux was based on It. I fucked up the installation and figured things out after some months I started distro hopping when I decided to keep using fedora for sometime.\n After using Linux as my first real OS I think I can safely say to new users Linux isn't hard if you can use Google and read manuals. Just decide your leaving Windows close the door and don't turn back, everything is hard when you compare it to something. The way you feel about Linux I feel the same about windows but that doesn't mean when my parents ask me why their windows machine has a problem I will say I don't know about windows when they bought me a laptop I've been using for a year.\n Sorry guys for this boring story.\n    submitted by    /u/Caultor  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hi guys, I just started a new job here in Germany and after completing my studies, I got into DevOps as a junior. I really love the networking world and I was already motivated to be in the Linux world than Windows. Our team leader gave us new members (me more 3 other colleagues), a few exercises about docker, ansible, jenkins, and other technologies to explore. I am struggling a lot with learning these technologies and I see that my colleagues are going way better than me (they are figuring out things faster and understanding the concepts). For example, ansible seems to be very \"easy\" to learn as everyone says and from what I read about it but for me has been very confusing. I am very sure that I am the problem and I notice a lot of lack of focus from my side, is not I am putting in lower hours, I actually put in more after work but has been a real struggle for me and after the day, this is killing my head together with my normal anxiety. I was on the Ansible documentation official website and seems so confusing to understand how things work, the same happened in Docker and Jenkins so I know that I am the problem and not the documentation itself. I really think these technologies are very good and a few things I was able to figure it out but has been so hard to my head, like the conceptions and the functionalities of those techs. Am I just really dumb? It will pass after a while or will I keep on this until I give up permanently? I think ansible is the tech that really made me think if this networking world was for me because everyone seems to use it very easily and I am struggling a lot. Well, I hope some of you can share your experiences and give me some ideas. I am on meds after having few panic attacks in the last months and I don't want to have that as an excuse to make this \"normal\" not being able to learn these things more easily. I appreciate if you guys took some time to read this, means a lot to me. Thanks!\n    submitted by    /u/Alive-Zucchini-3377  \n [link]   [comments]",

They care a lot about details and improving the user experience and interaction by identifying what new users are having problems with and trying to make the system welcoming to them. They really listen to feedback and improve. With the 17.1 version, they enhanced by a lot the usability of Windows Programs. For example, nice warnings that say \"This app isn't native to Linux, you can try some alternatives or the compatibility layer\" like recommending Heroic launcher when the user tries to run the Epic executable or automatically putting the program in Bottles.\n I would point out the main page for the Pro edition. In the Why pay page, they state that \"Zorin OS will always be free and open. We want to reward and celebrate those who support our mission, which is why we created Zorin OS Pro\", but it isn't very clear in other places that it's possible to have the same experience in ZorinOS Pro or Core.

I might want to add that my work environment and tools are mainly CLI-driven, and I mostly use CLI applications for everything (text editor, Git CLI, etc), including all the tools I use for my daily work.\n When choosing a terminal emulator, I focus mostly on usability and features. I personally use Wezterm because I find it incredibly malleable and easy to configure, while also providing very nice defaults. When I have used Alacritty in the past, I have found myself not liking it because it sacrifices a lot of things for the sake of performance, but I find myself unable to perceive the benefits of such performance improvements.\n I wanted to hear people's opinions mainly because I think I might be missing something, so please feel free to share your ideas and experiences.\n    submitted by    /u/ema2159  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "So, I was thinking about CC licenses the other day as I generally distribute my photos under CC BY-NC-SA 4.0. This absolutely and completely prohibits OpenAI (ClosedAI lol) from using my photos in training as they are mostly a for profit corp. At the same time, if we are considering a community developed open source model, NC clause doesn't apply any more. With the BY everything is also clear\n The SA (same alike license) part seems to be much more interesting in this case. It is because the photos produced by the model are most definitely derived from my photos and therefore must be distributed under the same or compatible license. Model's architecture, on the other hand, wasn't derived from my photos and therefore use whatever license it wants. Although here things become tricky as, at least as I understand it, the architecture is usually tied with the weights, that are tuned on my photos and, therefore, likely fall under a category of derived work\n Now we have a problem, as (likely) the whole model will need to use CC BY-NC-SA 4.0 or something compatible with it. As far as I'm concerned, there are no licenses compatible with my exact CC license and the CC is not recommend for software\n I think that it is a problem as openai pretty much doesn't care about that (and if it did, removing any part of the CC license can probably allow them to exploit it), while for fair developers of AI it makes content such as mine pretty much inaccessible, therefore benefiting the giant corps\n The only solution to the issue I see is to make a dedicated open license for AI as well as a revision to CC to insure compatibility and clarify such highly speculative points as what pars of models are actually considered derivatives\n Anyway, I want to be clear that I'm neither a lawyer nor a developer and I have never researched this topic in-depth.

          "description": "I couldn't find the postmarketOS subreddit, so I will post about this tip here.\n I recently had a problem updating my Google Nexus 5. After a upgrade, the boot image oversized beyond my device's boot partition limitation (~25M expected to fit 22M).\n I saw that it was compressing with gzip under default level, so I thought it could have a config file. Then I tried to print a help from mkinitfs, but it didn't gave me relevant information. Didn't had a manual neither.\n So I went to their APKBUILD to find out their repository to then read the manual there and found out that the configuration file is found under /usr/share/deviceinfo/deviceinfo file that could be replaced creating one at /etc/deviceinfo file.\n I needed to create a deviceinfo_initfs_compression and deviceinfo_initfs_extra_compression variables both with zstd:best compression:level set to hopefully make it as tiny as possible. Didn't made it as it created a 23M image.\n I thought about giving up on it. Instead I went on reading all the contents of the man page and found out that in /usr/share/mkinitfs/modules directory from 00-default.modules file had a btrfs module. I guess it assumed that I was using btrfs, but when I ran df -Th it returned me ext4 for both userdata* (1-2).\n After removing btrfs module, the boot image lowered to 14M and I could finally flash it and reboot without having to depend on pmbootstrap.\n There is also a vfat module, but I didn't touched it since I couldn't get the device's boot partition filesystem.\n If you happen to be using btrfs and no ext4, might remove ext4 from the modules. But I guess if you got a btrfs partition on your mobile device it means that you have a lof of space already set.\n I'm accepting suggestions to generate a better image file. Maybe use dracut somehow? Anyway, thank you all for reading!!!\n    submitted by    /u/KanuX14  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Well, I think this is the right place to ask about this. I am working on a Linux distribution that utilizes a package manager, or as I want to call it, a super utility. It employs Distrobox to manage packages from containers as unisolated environments and utilizes VMs for handling isolated environments. Essentially, users can leverage these features to make package installation more flexible.\n Additionally, I am considering a minimal yet customizable distro. Users will have the option of a GUI installer alongside the standard terminal installation. My primary goal is to enhance the experience for newcomers to Linux, attracting more users and fostering innovative software development, such as the aforementioned super utility.\n Question 1: What are your thoughts on this project? Do you think it is worth continuing?\n \"Question 2: What features or improvements would you like included in this distro, perhaps utilizing Flatpak to provide even more options for users? I am open to suggestions, and I will carefully consider each idea presented.\n    submitted by    /u/Commercial-Ad-8031  \n [link]   [comments]",

The books on grep/sed/awk also include a comprehensive chapter on regular expressions.\n All my books are free to read online, see https://github.com/learnbyexample/scripting_course#ebooks for links. Markdown source and example files are available in the respective GitHub book repos.\n I've also written interactive TUI apps for some of the exercises from these books. See https://github.com/learnbyexample/TUI-apps for installation instructions. For example, if you have pipx installed, use pipx install awkexercises for the app shown below:\n Screenshot from TUI app for Awk exercises\n I would highly appreciate it if you'd let me know how you felt about my books. It could be anything from a simple thank you, pointing out a typo, mistakes in code snippets, which aspects of the book worked for you (or didn't!) and so on. Reader feedback is essential and especially so for self-published authors.\n Happy learning :)\n    submitted by    /u/ASIC_SP  \n [link]   [comments]",

I'm discussing internaly the idea of creating a blog about it.\n For a quick recap, i'm a Network Engineer / Programmer that is leading a big Linux corporate migration at Policia Militar de Minas Gerais in Brazil. Our custom Ubuntu 22.04 distro is named \"Guara\" and were officially released yesterday. Guara has lots of custom and opensource software developed for the corporation needs, and aims to replace 22K PCs around the Minas Gerais state. In the first phase, we plan to replace 800 machines running an older Debian distros with mate desktop. This will be our first large scale test, as i write this post Guara is already running in 215 machines. In the second phase we plan to replace Windows 7 and 8 machines. To make the transition smoother we're also creating a series of small tik-tok tutorial videos, teaching basics for end users. Just for a quick note, here are our distro highilights:\n  \nUbuntu 22.04.4 based (24.04 already in the works)\n Onlyoffice 8.0\n Google Chrome\n Linphone as voip client\n Droidcam to use smartphones as webcams\n Some proprietary java applications\n Guara-updater \n Custom application developed for Guara.\n Automaticlally push custom configs at system boot\n \n Guara Installer \n Custom application created for Guara.\n Inventory the system and run initial scripts\n \n Argos Network Center \n Custom application created to test system components\n Test network conectivity\n Set http proxy for all the system (browser, cli and electron apps)\n Remote access with dynamic passwords (like teamviewer)\n \n  \nWe plan to open to project and release all the code as opensource, also create a reference documentation for a corporate linux migration with real world effort and dificulties along the way.\n Here is our special launch video, hope you like it.\n https://youtu.be/0uI0sIvVKAY\n    submitted by    /u/Sea-Load4845  \n [link]   [comments]",

Installing Mint unencrypted on the 128GB NVMe and putting the /home in a LUKS container that requires a passphrase on boot was relatively easy.\n Do custom partitioning. Set up a 1GB EFI partition and an ext4 partition using up the rest of the space on the 128GB drive, mounted as /. Create a crypto container with good passphrase on the 2TB drive, then reboot so it mounts. Create a ext4 partition taking up all of that container and mount as /home. \n This has the advantage of being faster than full disk encryption since boot drive isn't encrypted, and also requires a passphrase on boot that's longer than user passwords typically are. Also, move swap to the encrypted drive.\n The only gotcha is that the custom partitioning didn't add an entry to the EFI boot manager, so I had to add an entry manually using the efibootmgr command.\n    submitted by    /u/xs65083  \n [link]   [comments]",

There is no other solution, I can't even choose to use discrete or dedicate graphics while booting with switcheroo nor in BIOS.\n I have an Intel i5 1135G7 with dedicated Intel Iris Xe Max, and linux always uses the dedicated graphics card, I wasted two full nights looking for a solution but nothing, two nights changing distros, installing packages, drivers, running commands I found on internet and nothing.\n Windows can Manage both GPUs so it gives me 8 or 9 hours of battery while idling or using light software, while Pop OS, Manjaro, and Ubuntu only can shrink 3 hours of idling, and like 40 minutes of gaming, the computer is always hot, and software can't monitor it's temperature, so I guess it just works until direct motherboard circuit regulates its temperature, staying at like 90 degree Celsius while playing simple things as Fran Bow, burning my lap.\n It makes me kinda sad that Nvidia being a completelly closed code GPU has better support that Intel, that in theory has all its drivers open for being inplemented on Linux, it can't even track the GPU temperature, I really like Linux for its simplicity, while Windows is more and more bloated everyday, but for my laptop I have no choice, 3 times better battery life and reasonable temperatures is a no brainer for my laptop battery health, i'm going to miss Linux.\n    submitted by    /u/Sit_and_forget  \n [link]   [comments]",

And the great thing is that FOSS developers don't gatekeep their software from Windows/macOS (unlike the other way around), so they can install pretty much every free and open source software out there.\n How do I know this method works? Because it's how I fell in love with FOSS and Linux. I needed a way to remux a video file and all the options out there were paid. Until I came upon ffmpeg, which allowed you to not only remux video, but to do pretty much anything with it. It seemed too good for something that good to be free. That's when I looked into it and learned about free and open source software. After that I slowly switched all of my software to free and open source alternatives, until the only proprietary thing left on my PC was Windows itself.\n    submitted by    /u/crosspacelayer  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hi, I updated my Pixel 8 Pro to the 5/06/24 update of android 14. However when I did this, my SIM card was no longer being read. I am on Three UK and the anywhere in the settings where the SIM card was mentioned or network was mentioned was greyed out. I tried a bunch of solutions.\n This included:\n  \nRestarting the device multiple times\n Resetting the network settings\n Turning the device off for the day (I thought it might have been an overheating issue)\n  \nNothing worked, so I decided to flash the device with Googles browser flashing service. I tried the other latest build, AP2A.240605.024.A1, but I had the same issue. I almost gave up but then I thought to try the previous Android14 build that was on the 8 Pro, AP1A.240505.005.B1. This worked! I can use my network again on my Pixel 8 Pro. I will raise this as a bug with Android. I thought to post here also just in case other people were having the same issue.

          "description": "A somewhat sad day: Ron Amadeo is leaving Ars Technica and based on his [tweet](https://x.com/RonAmadeo/status/1801422612238585927), it sounds like he's more finished with writing completely than anything else: \n \"I guess I should tell everyone that I have quit! After 10 years at Ars Technia I'm done writing. I you've ever read anything of mine, thanks.\"\n Anyway, it's a big shame as Ron fearlessly held Google and co accountable, and over that 10 years mercilessly beat brands to death for substandard efforts. He famously started here in r/Android and worked his way up.\n It's the end of an era in some ways. The days of Android/iOS being interesting enough to do massive reviews and deep dives is over. Android and iOS are not boring but it's no longer wildly interesting to see what's coming next. At Google, Dave Burke who headed up Android for 14 years is moving to \"AI/bio\". \n Guys from the early Android era have largely left: Dieter Bohn is at Google now, Ron is leaving, David Ruddock left Android Police a few years ago to do something (I forget what) and is in Germany working elsewhere, Kris Carlon and lots of the Android Authority OGs have moved on - too many to name - but the long experienced and often very critical journalists/writers/analysts have left for other, hopefully greener pastures.\n No one is irreplaceable but some of the most trusted names, who know all of the good and bad, and didn't shy away from calling it out, are gone. Pour one out.\n    submitted by    /u/Tristan_R  \n [link]   [comments]",

I have NEVER seen people with so many issues with apple id as our family has within the last few months. What really pissed me off was the fact that I could not use my iPad to color and listen to music for my anxiety. I was walking around in circles at my house like a nut. Everything was activation locked. I was really pissed off. I contacted my carrier who was nice enough to apply a credit on all three and let me return it and then sent me new android devices. I had explained I never had an issue being locked out of Google for 15 years. All you need is your phone number and a family members added to multi factor and voila you're back in. You literally have to wait at least from a week to a month to get back in. It's stupid. \n    submitted by    /u/Amazing-Divide3286  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Howdy, Reddit!\n A little while ago I wrote a simple power consumption benchmark for Android web browsers, called browser-power-hour. I've since used it to test Chrome against Firefox on two different devices, and I'm here to share the results!\n Why is this useful? It's pretty common to see battery drain brought up as a reason to use (or avoid) certain web browsers, often without evidence. But browsers are complex and constantly evolving pieces of software... maybe those perceptions are out of date? Maybe they're still valid! Unlike raw performance, there are few, if any, good ways to reliably measure battery impact for an individual app, especially on Android, so it's hard to tell what's actually true. Hence, this project! My goal is to be able to provide objective metrics on browser power…",

          "description": "I'm curious what others are using as I'm looking to upgrade my watch to one that would pair well with an Xperia 1 V. I have used Fossil watches for the last few years but they've exited the smartwatch market and their watches were pretty meh but they were at least independent of any particular phone (like how the Galaxy Watch is meant to pair with Samsung devices). I've been eyeing the OnePlus watch since it's the best looking of the 3 main options available (Samsung, Google, OnePlus) but was also looking at the Tic Watch for it's long battery. All I really use my watch for is counting steps and dealing with notifications (bonus points if I can control my alarm app from the watch). So what's everyone using?\n    submitted by    /u/-Arkham  \n [link]   [comments]",

I just wanted to point this out because on every iPhone video, whenever the creator shows off the iPhone’s camera, not even stating a single name of Android, Android users just come and bash the comments with “Oh this S24…”, “S24:…” “S24 better…” etc. However, when people show off their S24 (or any android) camera, iPhone users never comment on them, and they just respect it. May I know why this is the case for majority and why Android users hate on Apple users? Why do Apple users have more calmness than majority of Android users?

          "description": "目前房子有一个传统的正压新风系统。机器到开关是 3 根线，分别是 220V 公共线，低速线，高速线。\n目前使用米家的单火开关会遇到因为微弱电流通过，新风工作指示灯常量的问题。\n新风开关边上有一个灯的开关走了零线和火线，但是不在一个空开下面，不能直接借用他的零线。\n想请教一下有没有支持独立 220V 供电接入的智能开关/继电器（从边上灯开关的零火线取电），最好是带互锁功能（开启高速自动关闭低速，开启低速自动关闭高速）",

PixelOS ，优点是尽可能接近 Pixel 体验，但是开发者名言目前版本还不支持自适应刷新率和杜比视界。\n2. LineageOS ，目前标示为非正式稳定版，似乎没有什么明显的功能缺失。\n3. AOSPA （ Paranoid ），暂时没看到其他用户反馈比较明显的 bug ，其他 ROM 的用户反而提到这个 ROM 电池寿命、AOD 等功能很赞。但之前从未刷过这个 ROM ，还是心里没底。\n4. CherishOS ，也是从未刷过的 ROM ，开发者说没什么 issue ，但下面的用户反馈有不少 bug 。\n恳请在用或通过小米 13 各种类原生 ROM 的 V 友，分享一下你的使用体验和建议，感谢！",

          "description": "我是个编程纯小白，在自学 Python 。选的入门书是《 Python 编程快速上手——让繁琐工作自动化》。这本书在众多的 Python 自学建议里都被提及，豆瓣评分也不错。但我发现，看不少视频教程，或者其他人的代码里，经常看到 class ，yield ，self ，__init__之类的方法（我也不知道该管他们叫什么，暂且统称方法吧），但是在《 Python 编程快速上手——让繁琐工作自动化》里似乎完全没有提及。我大致看了一下这几个方法的教程和视频，发现确实看不懂。我有几个问题：\n1 、请问为什么这么受好评的入门书里面不教这几个方法？\n2 、如果我不学这几个方法，未来会遇到什么问题？是否只是代码会写得繁琐一点，但还是能绕过去？（我学 Python 不是为了就业当程序员，只是为了提高工作效率）\n3 、可否用踢足球或者开汽车来类比一下这些方法？是否这些方法是类似于倒钩射门或者甩尾漂移？普通人一辈子都不会用到，不学无妨？还是说相当于 40 米远射？我射不了那么远，但可以麻烦一点多传几脚到禁区内再射门？\n请大神们指点迷津。",

          "description": "在 3 个月前，我在 V2EX 上首次分享了 PeerBanHelper这个小工具，用来和 hp/torrent 、dt/torrent 进行技术对抗。\n在这之后越来越多的朋友们加入了 PBH 社区，并贡献了许多关键模块和代码，在此对各位为 PBH 做出贡献的人们说声感谢。\n3 个月的更新迭代，现在新推出了 v4.3 版本，除了简单的过滤器，现在更支持伪装检测等等新功能，变化之大我想值得新开一贴再向各位重新介绍一下。\n新增支持的下载器\n在各位朋友的支持下，我们新扩展了两款下载器的支持，分别是：\nDeluge\nBiglyBT (Vuze/Azureus 家族)\n只需要分别安装为上述两款 BT 下载器安装扩展插件(Deluge|BiglyBT)，就可以连接到 PeerBanHelper 了。\n对于还不支持的下载器，可以先使用收集的 IP 规则库，降低影响。\n多拨检测\n感谢 Github 用户 @CharlesChou73 的出色贡献。PeerBanHelper 新版本现在还支持多拨检测，能够有效检测同一 IP 段下的大量异常用户并封禁它们，例如下图这样的：\n\n连锁封禁\n在新的版本里，当特定网段内有 Peers 触发规则被封禁时，它也会连锁封禁同网段下其它的 Peers ，即使它们没有触发多拨检测。\n新的 AviatorScript 脚本引擎\n新版本中全新添加了 AviatorScript 脚本引擎 以允许 PBH 的用户进行编程，编写自定义的脚本，改变 PBH 的行为。\n并由其拓展了两个基于 AviatorScript 的新功能：\nPeerID / ClientName 伪装检测\nPeerID/ClientName 伪装检测可以检测 PeerID 和 ClientName 不对应的客户端，例如 PeerID 是 -TR2770-，但 ClientName 却标注为 qBittorrent/4.2.5 的客户端。\n吸血雷判断\n根据特征判断迅雷是否是吸血变种，在 PeerID 和 ClientName 过滤器禁用迅雷检查后，AviatorScript 迅雷检测脚本就可以开始工作，通过 吸血雷快查表 判断迅雷是否是吸血变种，并只封禁吸血的变种。\n新的 WebUI\n在 @Gaojianli, @XiaoXice 和 @Kaffu-Chino 三位朋友的加入后，PeerBanHelper 的 WebUI 相比上次发帖的版本也获得了质的飞跃。\n除了现在支持通过 WebUI 添加、编辑、删除下载器外，还新增了封禁日志，规则订阅等多个模块。\n下载器\n封禁名单\n封禁日志\n规则订阅\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWindows 安装程序\n之前有朋友提出过建议，在 Windows 上部署困难，现在 PeerBanHelper 也提供了 Windows 的安装程序。和其它的软件一样，双击运行一路下一步就可以安装上了 ;)\n对于 Linux 包管理器和 MacOS 的安装包目前还在研究 install4j 中。这些系统的小伙伴还是要手动装一下 JRE 或者使用 Docker 镜像。\n社区其它内容\n在上次发帖后，PBH 社区也迎来不少 BT 爱好者小伙伴，我们一起建设了一个仓库存放一些可能有用的东西，比如：\nPeerID 速查表 与 @ie12 一起维护的快查表，可以 Ctrl+F 快速查找 PeerID 和客户端对应关系\n吸血雷参考表\n获取 PeerBanHelper\nhttps://github.com/PBH-BTN/PeerBanHelper\n注：gitcode.com 上面的仓库不是我们传的 :(\n最后聊聊别的\n最初编写这款工具的时候，仅仅用于临时目的，并希望这种行为能够随着时间逐渐消失。然而现实是，随着时间推移，这种刷流量的方法似乎正在传播的越来越广。\n在这种情况泛滥后，看到不少朋友决定停止做种/屏蔽整个中国 IP 地址。破坏者为了满足一己私欲，正在波及和摧毁整个国内的 BT 生态（特别是在 IPV6 普及后，难得有所好转之时）。\n希望 PeerBanHelper 能够帮助到那些仍然愿意把互联网精神继续坚持下去的朋友们。不求回报，帮到就好 ;)\n感谢\n感谢这些朋友们，为 PBH 贡献代码，或者参与公共资源编写（排名不分先后）：\n@ie12\n@Gaojianli\n@PluieM\n@zhongfly\n@CharlesChou73\n@DDSRem\n@Ovler-Young\n@BUnipendix\n@Kaffu-Chino\n@XiaoXice\n@azicen",

Gradle 在编译阶段先读取配置文件,然后在将需要排除的文件通过类似\"exclude\"的方式进行排除,排除后在进行编译;\n2. 通过 GraalVM 的 native-image 功能来编译成指定的可执行文件,这一部分不太了解;\n各位大佬,有没有了解过相关的解决方案或者思路,感谢.",

          "description": "房间里的蚊子，似乎变聪明了，以往睡前我会沿着墙壁找停落在上面的蚊子将其拍死，因为白色的墙面很容易将它们找出来，但是最近遇到一个现象，关灯后蚊子嗡嗡响，开灯后却在墙上找不见，于是我拿着手电跟踪，发现每次开灯后它们要么钻到犄角旮沓，要么停靠在棕黑色的柜子，门框上，这些地方或因底色或因光线不足视觉效果偏暗，和蚊子体色相似，导致它们不容易被发现。难道在和我的斗争中，这些蚊子进化了吗，还是说停靠在白墙上的蚊子已经被我拍死绝了，现在这一批是外地来的蚊子，时代变了？\n这让我想起了生物课本上一个关于物种进化的案例，大概内容是伦敦地区开展工业革命后，源源不断的煤持续燃烧，排出的废物将某一个地区的树干熏黑了，这片树林间栖息着一种蛾子（好像是吧记不清了），它们靠着和树干相似的体色伪装自己躲避敌人，科学家发现，随着树干变黑，栖息在表面的蛾子的体色也逐渐变黑了，因为此时黑色的树干之上，蛾子原本的体色，变得异常明显，大大加剧了被天敌发现的风险。",

          "description": "关于找工作，最近行情很差。很多人不甘心，不接受找不到合适工作，经历心态崩溃的过程。有些人不能理解为什么工作突然变得有多么难找。浅浅分析了一下，假设市场处于扩张期，公司 A 新开了业务，增加了 10 个岗位，这 10 个人可能是从别的公司跳槽过来的，也可能是原本就没工作的人。假设有 5 个是跳槽的，5 个是原本没工作的。于是 5 个跳槽的原公司就有缺了 5 各职位，市场上有多出来五个职位空缺，那么在一段时间内。市场上的有效职位其实是 15 个，此时相对而言工作容易找。因为一个失业的人，除了那 10 个新增的机会，还有跳槽空出来的五个机会。而市场处于收缩期的话，公司裁掉 10 个人，原本可能想裸辞或者跳槽的人突然也不敢了。也就是说除了整体职位的变少，连跳槽空来的职位也变少了，同时求职的人还变多了。所以此时有效职位减少的更多。所以这多少有点踩踏的味道。类似银行挤兑和通缩螺旋。\n关于找国外公司，即使英语过关很可能也不容易。因为换位思考，一个外国人很可能没听说过你读的学校或者你工作过的公司。名校和名企除外。所以他很难识别你的水平，哪怕你真的实力达到水平。换位思考，你要招一个外国人，他读的大学你没听说过，你很可能认为是个野鸡大学。他工作过的公司你也没听说过。很难知道是不是个皮包公司或者是个虚构的公司。所以你倾向于不冒这个风险，所以这就是很多人强调 GitHub 的作用，因为这是除了学历和名企之外。最能证明你实力的东西。\n关于才华。通常我们认为一个人有才华，我们指的是什么？我们会认为周杰伦有才华，我们也会认为林丹有才华，高考状元有才华。但是这里面的才华是有所不同的。因为周杰伦有才华是因为他创作出了优秀的作品，而林丹和高考状元是在一种制定好的规则中通过竞技取得名次。发现没有，前者是有作品，真正的产生了产品。而后者一种内卷，竞技排名。优秀的音乐创作者有很多，但是竞技体育的冠军只有一个。所以如果你错过了高考，没有在考试中取得一个好成绩。你想证明你有才华，大概率只有创作出优秀的作品这一条路了。\n找工作背八股文也是一种竞技体育，你背，你的竞争对手也在背。这是一种没完没了的核竞赛，这是当前技术面试的现状。希望所有看到这段文字的面试官都不要再考察八股文了。希望大家通过作品证明自己才华。",

          "description": "（先此声明：标题所言「关闭」是指运营商局端关闭，而非用户手机端关闭）\n本人 iPhone 15 Pro Max ，卡 1 移动 8 元保号套餐（每月 30 分钟通话时长，无数据流量），卡 2 电信（通话时长和数据流量都管够），手机设置仅由卡 2 提供蜂窝数据，「允许切换蜂窝数据」功能未启用。\n最近从 10086 下发的短信发现卡 1 每月会产生少量（ 0.几至 3.几 MB ）数据流量（身边朋友和本站都有相同情况 /t/878140 /t/990518 /t/1005849 /t/1032855 ），于是想让移动关闭该卡上网功能。其实这张卡降至保号套餐时就想过关闭上网功能，但当时移动客服说关闭上网功能会导致高清语音通话不可用，所以我权衡一下就没关。但最近在网上看到江苏移动可关闭上网功能并办理「独立高清语音」业务，让我内心一喜。\n\n更多参考链接：\nhttps://www.v2ex.com/t/1032855#r_14598179\nhttps://tieba.baidu.com/p/8962476840\nhttps://www.xiaohongshu.com/explore/6644163a000000001e032201\nhttps://www.txrjy.com/thread-1335643-1-1.html\n\n然而，我联系 10086 后，广东移动客服表示取消上网功能就无法使用高清语音通话，也没有所谓的「独立高清语音」业务可办理，如果想关闭上网功能并保留高清语音通话，可以选择「暂停」上网功能，这个「暂停上网功能」不会与高清语音通话互斥。但是，槽点来了：会在下个月结日自动恢复上网功能，届时需要用户再次办理暂停方可再次关闭上网功能…… 您就说移动这操作恶不恶心人？\n行，咱无可奈何选择暂停上网功能，此时手机依然能连接到 4G/5G 网络，也能使用 VoLTE 或 VoNR ，然后我试着将「 iPhone - 设置 - 蜂窝网络 - 蜂窝数据」关闭，此时 iPhone 状态栏信号格旁的 4G/5G 文字消失。\n\n\n\n然后我用移动卡和电信卡分别拨打 10086 、10000 ，同时通过 *3001#12345#* 查看 Cellular Service Status ，发现此时通话模式均为 VoNR （我之前一直以为必须要开启手机的蜂窝数据功能才能使用 VoLTE/VoNR ，原来不是，这点我在安卓手机上也试验了同样如此）\n\n\n好，最后回到标题：广东移动是否支持关闭数据流量功能并保留高清语音通话(VoLTE/VoNR)？\n是，也不是。\n（ PS.至于暂停上网功能能否不在下个月结日自动恢复，而是由用户有需求时再办理恢复上网功能。有用户此前向广东移动投诉过，广东移动至今不予解决。https://www.txrjy.com/forum.php?mod=redirect&goto=findpost&ptid=1335637&pid=13911798 ）",

          "description": "一、股票行情报价 api 接口\n量化投资者，获取即时的实时行股票行情报价数据是金融从业者和投资者必不可少的需求之一。随着技术的发展，美股数据、A 股数据、港股数据的实时行情数据 API 、行情数据接口成为了实现这一目标的主要方式之一。美股实时行情 API 是指一种应用程序接口，通过它可以获取美股市场上的实时股票价格、交易量等数据。通过使用美股实时行情数据 API ，用户可以实时监测股市动态、进行实时交易决策，从而更好地把握市场机会。\n但是，要想充分利用美股实时行情报价 API 、行情数据接口，首先需要对美股实时股票行情数据有着清晰的理解。美股实时股票行情数据涵盖了股票的实时价格、成交量、市值等信息，是投资者进行交易决策的重要依据之一。因此，美股实时行情数据对接成为了金融科技领域的热门话题之一。通过实现美股行情数据、K 线数据对接，用户可以将实时行情数据与自己的交易系统或者分析工具相连接，实现更加精准的交易决策和风险管理。\n二、以 MT5 接入实时股票行情数据为例，讲述接入步骤：\n2.1 、选择好你要接入的股票行情源：AllTick api\n [官网] : https://alltick.co/\n [ Github ] ： https://github.com/alltick/realtime-forex-crypto-stock-tick-finance-websocket-api\n [接入流程] ： https://github.com/alltick/realtime-forex-crypto-stock-tick-finance-websocket-api/blob/main/access_guide_cn.md\n2.2 、接入实现原理\nMT5 官方提供了整套的 Gateway 接口，通过继承特定的类，实现一些就可以把股票行情数据报送到 MT5 Trade Server,这就上涉及到以下几个大步骤：\n先拿到行情源的实时行情报价数据，实时的，源源不断的得到\n再实现继承 MT5 Gateway API 的程序\n然后通过具体的推送方法把数据推送到 MT5 Trade Server 。\n2.3 、MT5 Gateway API 介绍\nMT5 Gateway API 是用于将 MT5 平台与其他交易系统或者行情数据源集成的一整套工具接口。使用 Gateway API ，您可以实现自定义交易网关和数据源。Gateway API 是一整套 API 功能,包括所使用的数据结构的描述、网关的标识符和虚拟接口， 它的开发语言是 C++，开发工具常以 visual studio 为主，它提供的 32 位和 64 位 DLL 库的源代码示例。涉及与交易平台互动的所有技术细节都隐藏在 DLL 库中，这可以使用简单的方法来控制集成。因此，开发人员的代码不取决于内部变化，并且代码始终都可运行。\n2.4 、具体的接入步骤\n2.4.1 、接入股票行情数据源-AllTick\n接入 AllTick 的实时股票行情源请参考上面 2.1 章节的链接，按照接入流程一步一步就接好了，接好之后数据备用。\n2.4.2 、初始化 CMTGatewayAPIFactory\n声明一个全局的 CMTGatewayAPIFactory 实例即可，并调用 Initialize 一次就好了，它的作用是于创建 GatewayAPI 实例。\n2.4.3 、初始化 GatewayEventSink\n该类继承了 IMTGatewaySink ，用于处理 MT5 Trade Server 的连接情况。\n\n2.4.4 、创建 IMTGatewayAPI\n通过调用 CMTGatewayAPIFactory 的具体实例的 Create 方法创建 GatewayAPI 实例，要注意传参数\n2.4.5 、向 IMTGatewayAPI 发送报价数据\n当从股票行情数据源接收到实时成交报价时，例如从 AllTick 收到它推送的实时成交报价，则调用 GatewayAPI 的 SendTicks 方法向 MT5 Trade Server 发送成交报价\n当从股票行情数据源接收到实时盘口报价时，例如从 AllTick 收到它推送的实时盘口报价，则调用 GatewayAPI 的 SendBooks 方法向 MT5 Trade Server 发送盘口报价\n2.5 、部署\n部署的方式有两种：\n部署到 MT5 Trade Server 本地，然后在 MT5 Admin 平台上进行新增加数据源。\n外部独立部署，然后在 MT5 Admin 平台上进行新增加数据源。\n无论采用哪种方式结果是一样的，关于部署的细节，后续会再单独写篇文章来说明。",

          "description": "2024 ，0611-0616 ，第 24 周\n坚持了 162 天后，终于破戒了，点了外卖。点的是健康沙拉餐，吃完后第二天还真就掉秤了。\n本周开发\n国内安卓市场\n这周国内四个安卓市场（ HMOV ）都同步更新了极简日记和极简便签，更新内容只有一点：加入备案信息的显示。\n之前收到了小米的通知，必须在 App 中加入备案号的显示，还提供了规范文档。我没留意其他几个市场是否有同样的要求，索性就一起更新了。按照国内安卓市场的尿性，都是一丘之貉，早晚的事。\n极简时钟新版本一切就绪，但是一想到要操作后端和数据库就心生胆怯，于是拖延症就又犯了。\n极简时钟\nApp Store\niOS 版的新表盘还在开发中，一言难尽，进度不理想。\nGoogle Play\nGoogle Play Console 终于又开放了 TestFlight ，这下可以在手机上看到各种数据了，就不用跑到电脑上看了。\n没想到上周的下载量并没有触底反弹，反而还在下降，这周差一点跌破了 700 。\n\n上周开始的两个实验都没有看出来任何效果。商品详情实验，因为下载量很低，所以也看不出来两版截图的优劣。价格实验，因为针对的 10 个国家都几乎没有付费，所以也看不出来区别。\nWWDC24\n\n没看直播，周二早上醒来后看了眼各种群内的讨论，感觉这一届 WWDC 带来的惊喜并不多。\n作为重头戏的 Apple Intelligence 目前还不能体验，而开发者非常关心的 Xcode16 的代码补全功能，需要满足四个条件才能使用到：\nmacOS 15\n16G 内存以上\nApple Silicon\n非大陆的 Mac\n是的，大陆的开发者都不能使用，这次锁的是机器，我们又因为各种各样的原因被特殊对待了。不过呢，在看了国外开发者分享的视频后，目前 Xcode16 的代码补全功能非常孱弱，比起其他 Copilot 差得太多太多了。心理又好受了一丢丢。\n对于这届 WWDC 我比较失望，不仅发布的各种新特性没什么精彩之处，剩下的大部分还都是期货，就连官方看 WWDC Session 的 Developer 也出问题了，必须改成英文才能刷出来最新的视频，之前我一直用中文，就奇怪为什么一直没有新视频。Developer 改成英文后，就没有了中文字幕，再加上加载速度慢，还不如在 YouTube 上看 Apple 自己上传的视频，加载又快又清晰还有中文字幕。\n我对这次 WWDC24 的兴奋点比起之前低很多，这一周只看了五六个 Session ，都是关于 SwiftUI 和 Xcode 的，除了几个需要跟进适配的功能，目前也没发掘出什么可以值得做的 idea 。\n新尝试\n之前看 WWDC 的 Session 后大部分的新特性都会忘掉，因为只是走马看花地看一遍，并没有亲手敲代码。这一年决定把自己感兴的新 API 都写一遍，最先写的就是今年新推出的 Zoom Transition 。代码很简单，写完了就冒出个念头，录个 demo 视频上传到 Youtube 岂不更好，正愁频道里没有新内容呢。平时也总看别人的代码示例视频，自己也就尝试做了一个。\n本来是想用 QuickTime Player 录屏，但是群友更推荐 OBS ，研究了一下，确实不错。尽管不是直播，但是录的时候还是状况频出，总感觉有人在看似的，居然有些紧张。比起平时写代码，更多出现了拼写错误和 API 拼写错误。全程我没有讲话，就是纯录屏，录完了把出错的地方都剪掉，添加个片头和片尾就直接提交了。\n由于是第一次录这种视频，发现了很多需要改进的地方：\n字体要大一些，不能用平时写代码的字体大小\n想解释的东西都靠注释写在了 Xcode 中，这里或许用剪辑软件添加额外的说明文字更好\n视频的各种元数据还需要多向同类视频学习",

          "description": "各位 V 友晚上好，先简单介绍一下背景，我目前购买了三家机场的订阅，其中一家机场提供了 EMBY 服务，仅限他自己的节点来访问；目前主力使用的代理工具为 OpenClash ，我通过订阅转换将三家机场的节点合并成了一个配置文件，但因订阅转换实使用的是公共的远程配置，自然也无法自定义 EMBY 服务使用的节点了。\n想要达成的效果不算很复杂，即能有一个 EMBY 的策略组和规则，且这个策略组中只包含了那家机场的所有节点，并且希望更新订阅时，策略组和规则不会被移除等。\n目前有一些思路，比如在 clash 端设置自定义规则和策略组，或者在订阅转换时增加相应的策略组和规则。后者若能实现适用性更广一些，届时可用于其他一些代理软件。\n无奈本人比较小白，经过一些搜索和学习，还是没能理解和掌握 OpenClash 中自定义的功能，特别时“覆写设置”、“一键生成”、“规则附加”以及“配置管理”中的“自定义”字眼的设置，还望各位 V 友能够不吝赐教，先在此谢过了！",

L 系列能进入美国的话, 绝对能把那些歪瓜裂枣打得落花流水, 我对这话负责)\n李想同学对于车型和配置还是很有深刻了解的, 脚踏实地造人民想要的车也是个正确的方向, 也许能在这激烈的竞争环境中脱颖而出.\n现在已经全力买 LI 了.\n企业做大后也许还是要有远大的理想, 开发前沿科技改变出行方式能让理想走得更远?\nBYD:\n炙手可热.\n国内外很多人不了解造车新势力, 但对 BYD 却不陌生. 在控制成本和研发方面确实也做得很好, 也许能取代丰田独领全球汽车市场?\n个人对 BYD 车的设计和配置实在提不起兴趣, 人还是要有的审美的吧. \n小米:\nSU7 也许是一辆好车, 市场好像也不错.\n小米能整合供应链, 也能开发出自己的东西, 后续车型应该也不错.\n小米已经是巨型企业了, 实在没必要做这种赤裸裸的抄袭. 还真没想到普罗大众对抄袭的容忍度这么高. \n问界以及各种界:\n有些车型在用料方面还是舍得下本的, 华为光环对车还是有实际提升的.\nAgain, 个别车型的外观抄袭还是很无耻的.\n造车厂商和华为还是存在利益分歧的, 苹果在已经栽了, 很怀疑各种界能否走得长远.\n其他各品牌:\n这个我也没啥有意义的看法, 传统厂商滞后了这么多年, 不知道其现在能否取得优势. 也许能在成本和质量方面取得优势, 这恰恰也是最重要的, 这成就了丰田, 也许能成就某些传统厂商.\n好啦, 这里就瞎扯啦一些自己的看法, 也提到了股票. 主要是想了解车, 买股票只是想验证自己的看法.\n车圈水军脑残粉太多了, 希望这里能看到更多真实的想法)))",

          "description": "上一个帖子是因为看到了《脱了裤子放屁》那篇帖子写的，但不仅仅是因为这篇，印象中之前也看到过类似的，记不清了，也可能是无中生记了。\n我也说说我的看法，不一定对，欢迎拍砖指正，只要说得对，骂一骂也没关系。（我这篇也是来秀无知的)\n++++++++++++++++++++++++++\n首先明确的是，重放攻击的重点在于：如果有第三方拿到一个网络请求，在不解包的情况下，重复发送该请求，会造成服务出现\"安全问题\"。\n\n第一，攻击者不需要解包，因为它的假设是，攻击者(不需要/不能)从请求中抓取有用信息，也(不需要/不能)篡改请求。\n\n第二，跟幂等的关系。幂等的意思是 n 次操作的结果等同于一次操作，是允许多次操作的，而防重放供给是不允许重复请求的，这会造成\"安全隐患\"。不过对于某些场景某些实现的\"幂等\"是可以起到防重的作用的。比如某些幂等的实现是只有第一次请求是真的在操作，后续重复请求实际上是\"没有操作\"的。\n举个不恰当的例子：假如你有一个登录接口在登录成功后返回用户信息，内部实现也支持了幂等，即：同一个用户多次登录和一次登录的效果是等效的,session 只有一个，但是却没有考虑重放攻击的问题。再假设攻击者拦截到该登录请求，是不是攻击者在不修改请求的情况下，也可以登录系统？\n\n第三，限流是限流，重放攻击是重放攻击。限流强调频次，重放攻击的重点不在于频次，它可能只需要一次就可以攻击成功。我们需要明确自己需要的是限流还是防重放攻击还是都需要？\n\n第四，请求需要被加密保护或者有私钥签名是基本条件，因为如果请求不加密，也没有私钥签名/加密，一定能被攻击者构造。但是跟 https 协议本身有没有防重放攻击的支持没有关系，这两个不在同一层面。\napi 请求可以是像 web 端被 https 加密保护，也可以是给第三方使用被一个\"私钥\"保护。\n第五， 我认为这是容易造成混乱边界范围不清晰的一个点。即：\"重复一个请求\"指的是重复用户\"发出的请求\"，还是说，攻击者也可以根据客户端泄露的代码等信息\"构造出一条参数一摸一样的请求\"。我认为是前者，\n因为攻击者如果是通过查阅客户端代码构造出请求，它可以构造出任何请求。这种情况应该不在\"重放攻击\"范围内，重放攻击本身也是属于中间人攻击。\n\n第六，原帖提到\"token 的生成规则\"，说\"攻击者也可以完全模拟这个 token 的生成规则，来绕过服务端\"。攻击者当然可以拿到生成规则，包括生成签名的公钥。\n\t1. 作者的方案，是客户端生成 token ，假定了攻击者能够拿到客户端的规则、可能还包括了生成签名的公钥。所以攻击者可以构造一个攻击请求。但是这不是\"重放攻击\"的讨论范围，这不是\"拦截到请求进行重放\"，而是构造了一个新的请求，该请求的参数可以由攻击者任意指定。\n\t\t2. 对于客户端生成 token ，因为含有：随机数、时间戳，所以服务端可以在一次处理完成之后记忆下来，在近 n 分钟内不再处理含有相同随机数、时间戳的请求。中间人自然无法重放攻击。中间人即便拦截到请求，也无法篡改其随机数、时间戳，可能是因为整个请求是加密的、也可能是因为请求含有私钥签名。\n\n最后，原作者说：\"sync ，lock ，多线程等，工作中根本用不到\"，作者给出的代码，很明显有一个地方因为没有用锁或者 redis 的原子操作，会导致这个代码防重失效。\n且看原作者代码：\n```\n\t\tString s = redisService.opsForValue().get(timestamp);\n\t\tif (StringUtils.isNotEmpty(s)) {\n\t\t\treturn false;\n\t\t} else {\n\t\t\tredisService.opsForValue().set(timestamp, timestamp, NONCE_DURATION, TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS);\n\t\t}\n```",

          "description": "不太想吃个哑巴亏，求大伙帮我分析一下。\n我前两天在京东上买了一个京东京造的充电宝，当晚给我媳妇的 iphone xs 充电。第二天我媳妇说这手机一直在发烫，不充电也发烫。我让我媳妇赶紧去换个电池。\n今天在维修点，检测人员说电池健康状态看着还行，估计是主板出问题了，换了新电池可能一样会发热，解决不了问题。说我们这手机也有点老了不值得再浪费钱修了。和他说了是用充电宝之后这样的，他说可能有关系。\n结果就是我在京东上花了九千块钱给我媳妇买了一新手机。哎。我也不是心疼钱，本来打算等九月出新款再买的，现在计划打乱了有点不爽。\n接下来就气人了。我去京东上找客服问。咱们实话实说，我是心想，你这玩意给我手机冲坏了，我 TM 还花九千块钱在你这买个手机，你哪怕给我五十块手机抵用券也算意思一下了对不？也不过分吧？\n然后这京东的客服，我是真的无语。这是培训出来故意怼人的吗？一顿“请提供证据证明是充电宝导致的”，“有维修站点开具的证明吗”，“无法证明是我们充电宝的问题”，证明是我们充电宝问题我再给您处理”。我去，我本来好好的，聊两句给我气够呛。\n我媳妇这手机在使用充电宝之后开始发热是事实，在时间上是有先后顺序的。咱们有一说一，也确实有可能是巧合。这因果关心我是证明不了的。检测点开具证明也是天方夜谭，检测点连我的手机使用过这个充电宝这种简单事实都证明不了，怎么敢开具证明说是京东的充电宝导致我的手机坏了？能说一句“有可能”“不排除”就顶天了。在几率渺茫的情况下我也不可能花大价钱去做这个检测吧，除非给我报销。\n我不太懂硬件，想请相关技术的朋友帮我分析一下。有没有可能是充电宝对旧手机型号支持有问题，充电过载了把主板弄残了所以一直发热？我就想知道有没有这种可能。\n如果说从技术上讲就赖不到这充电宝头上那就算我理亏了。如果说这种可能概率还比较大，我就去再找个平台投诉一下。我没有胜诉的希望，我单纯就发泄一下。手机一冲就坏了然后一个劲儿被人怼鼻子说“证明是我们充电宝问题我再给您处理”是真 TM 憋屈。",

          "description": "之前一直是用 kindle KPW 看书，正经书籍，网文都看，每天阅读也不小至少 30-60 分钟，至少算半个重度使用。kindle 现在卡的已经不行了，而且看 pdf 很难用（切边，重排等），再加上国产读书越来越好用了，决定抛弃 kindle 生态。但是对国产阅读器不是很了解，求推荐。\n大致需求是：\n1. 必须是带背光墨水屏，不要 ipad 。眼睛已经高度近视了，看久了电子屏幕会累，发紧。\n2. 为了便携，不超过 7-8 寸。也不需要笔，不用笔记，不用看漫画，带不带声音不在乎。开放还是闭源系统无所谓，能满足看书就行。\n3. 看 pdf 重排和切边等希望比较强。我看的 pdf 主要是一些学习用的教材（不是数理化那种，而是经济类这种文字占主要篇幅的），为了便携选择小屏幕了，所以必须能切边重排，不能像 kindle 一样看 pdf 一坨。。。\n4. 最好支持微信读书，一是三端互通传书方便，二是读那种 txt 网文能自动分章节。但是如果能满足上面两个特点，换掉微信读书也行。\n谢谢大家了！！！",

          "description": "最近在小红书上看到有人分享的支付宝开始支持NFC 支付的消息，发现他们现在正在上海静安大悦城进行试点推广，趁着还没打烊，立马杀了过去体验了一下，给大家分享下\n（注：本贴图片均可以点击跳转大图）\n宣传活动\n首先能看到的是他们的宣传，目前的活动是扫码领取最高 20 块的商场立减券，我领到了 9 块\n虽然活动日期写的是到 10 号，不过看券的详情，最近的几个周末大概率都有活动\n想参与的最好先别扫这个，领了今天就过期，建议等下个周末再看看\n\n\n\n支持商户\n在商户的支持上，目前静安大悦城的大部分商户都没问题，基本每个柜台上都能看到支付宝的NFC 收款设备，另外上海的一些便利店也有支持，未来应该可以进一步普及\n尽管如此，有个非常尴尬的问题摆在面前，就是上海大部分的连锁餐饮店都实现了线上点单，整个大悦城 B1 层没有几个店是有必要用NFC 支付的（虽然他们都摆出来了），真正适合拿出来用的还是优衣库、NIKE 、名创等这些购物店\n\n支付流程\n接着是实际的支付流程：\n对于商户来讲，跟付款码支付应该没太大区别（也不应该有）\n点亮屏幕，解锁手机\n手机 NFC 区域靠近支付宝设备\n支付宝自动唤起（图 1），界面无订单信息，仅有确认支付按钮（苹果可能会多一步 App Clips ）\n点击确认按钮，完成支付（图 2），稍等显示订单支付详情（图 3）\n\n\n\n整个流程在安卓端的使用体验还是比较流畅的（大部分厂商对支付宝启动、后台都有优化）\n个人没有苹果设备，不过就小红书上看到的视频，iPhone 体验并不是很好，首先多了一步 App Clips ，之后支付宝的启动加载速度也不如人意，估计预先启动下支付宝会好点\n唤起后没有订单、商户、支付方式等信息有点让人懵逼，可能是为了支付速度考虑\n实现方式？\n个人对这个领域并不非常了解，随便推测下，欢迎大家指正交流\n是什么：可以唤起支付宝的动态 NFC Tag ？\n安卓 Intent / 苹果 App Clips ？\n客户端可以根据订单号向服务器发送确认支付的请求\n支付完成后可以根据订单号查询订单金额、商户、支付方式等\n如果不携带有可能根据其他因素来确定订单吗？（时间、定位、蓝牙 etc.）\n确认界面什么信息都没有，商户号好像没必要？\n确认界面什么信息都没有，大概率没带\n为什么：根据前面的支付截图推测，Tag 里大概只有订单号，甚至在点击确认支付按钮前客户端可能都没有联网查询订单信息，支付成功前的数据交互非常简洁，这是为了整个支付体验更加流畅，减少不稳定网络因素的影响吗？\n总之整个体验下来还是挺新鲜的，也产生了不少疑问，就目前的流程来看，并没有比付款码方便多少，支付宝冷启动的情况下流畅度也未必能保证，乍一看好像没有什么必要。不过对于新的探索个人还是愿意支持的，大家都对 NFC 支付的期望很大，如果能有一个成熟落地的方案，相信能够解决排队刷码的痛苦，给生活带来更多便利~",

          "description": "看到很多人说 spring security 复杂。个人认为复杂以下几个方面。（说句废话：研究过其实也就不复杂了）\n第一，spring security 的 filter 和如何配置 filter 这两部分的设计是分离的，恰恰是如何配置 filter 这部分做了高度抽象（涉及 HttpSecurity 、WebSecurity 、SecurityConfigurer 、SecurityBuilder 相关接口），导致不熟悉的用户很难将 filter 内部和配置串联起来。我认为这些高度抽象的配置相关设计让用户感到复杂的罪魁祸首。\n\n第二，通常最符合我们直觉的是：一个请求会经过哪些 filter ，以 url 的角度来描述 filter 序。但事实上配置起来可不是这么回事，配置时我们通常是：这个 filter 需要匹配哪些 url ，站在了 filter 的角度去匹配 url 。当有人接手我们的代码，或者我们自己，在稍微复杂一点的个性化需求下，也需做一个心理模型的转换，转换到一个请求应该先后经过哪些 filter 才能达到我们的预期。\n第三，spring security 的 filter 某些设计是有些复杂，比如用户密码登录 filter 又涉及到 authenticationManager ，用户信息查询、密码处理以及登录成功失败如何按需处理等等，鉴权部分又涉及到表达式，但其实 debug 串一串还好。\n第四，filter 是有序的，比如登录 filter 前后有一些重要的 filter ，可能和 session/cookie 相关，可能和 SecurityContext 相关，可能和异常相关，这一部分我觉得遵循\"filter 有序\"debug 串一串，读一读源码其实行也还好。如果想要知道 servlet 的 filter 是怎么搞的，spring 的 filter 又是如何桥接到 servlet 中的 filter 的，filter 又是怎么到 controller 的，怎么样可以 filter 直接 response 而不用到 controller ，怎么样可以让一个请求不走 filter 直达 controller 可能还需要再花点功夫。\n\n暂时想到这些。综合起来我觉得导致用户感到复杂的就是\"高度抽象的配置接口\"，其他看看官方文档，滴一滴 bug ，看看源码接口设计其实都不是啥问题。",

          "description": "Investors usually dislike gambling comparisons. Yet at a recent conference held by Norges Bank Investment Management, which oversees Norway’s oil fund of $1.6trn, a packed hall sought to learn from a former poker pro. Annie Duke was there to talk about quitting decisions, a topic on which she wrote the book (“Quit: The Power of Knowing When to Walk Away”). Ms Duke argued that many factors stack the deck against people considering quitting, pushing them to act irrationally. That applies to poker players wondering whether or not to fold—and also to investors considering whether to exit a position.\n赌场环境下，有很多因素导致玩家做出非理性的选择，投资者也类似。\na packed hall 一个挤满了人的大厅，这里的意思是一大厅的人都在学…",

          "description": "背景：\n楼主是广东某双非本科大三学生，现在的专业是电子商务，自知前途一般，所以也在找别的出路。从大一开始有同学带着做机器学习相关的竞赛，从那时候开始入门，然后开始接触数据分析、数据挖掘这方面的之后，发现对这些比较感兴趣后，就开始自己多去接触学习了这方面的知识，西瓜书、花书也买来看过，基本的机器学习算法模型是了解的，XGBoost 、LGBM 、yolo 之类的模型、算法，虽说原理没有仔细钻研过，不过该调包该调参还是会的，会主动学习新领域的知识，所以在这三年也打过几个比赛，至于结果的话，只有一两个成绩能拿的出手😭。\n考研\n从上面背景也可以看出，楼主也是想吃数据分析、数据科学这方面的饭的，了解过数分岗位的话对于学历要求可能没有数据挖掘、算法开发岗这么高，当然薪酬对应也相对低一点。\n考虑到岗位的要求、本身专业的限制以及楼主可能更想赚点小钱钱，所以也是从去年开始就准备考暨南大学应用统计的研究生（当然我也了解到，如果要搞算法岗的话，大概率非 92 不要，而且计算机硕可能更合适，不过这已经是楼主尽力摸高能到的相关专业）。\n但是说实话，目前也不太了解暨大的应统出来到底能不能跟我预期考研的目标匹配，如果有暨大应统的学长学姐解惑就最好了，感激不尽。\n考研的担忧\n楼主之所以考研有点忧虑，一是因为听到许多研究生毕业出来也难找工作，二是牛某网的等的论坛帖子中，对于本科拿到好工作 offer 后的建议也都是”推荐工作，没准考研后连现在待遇的 offer 都拿不到“的言论影响了判断，感觉考研上岸也不是一定会是正收益了。\n实习\n上网经常看见这种”想要考研上岸就不要想别的，整天担心忧虑自己考不上就一定考不上“这样的话，楼主对这些言论通常有点嗤之以鼻的态度，当然也可能因为没考过研，年轻气盛才不喜欢这种言论。但看现在的形势，考研越来越难，而且像是应用统计这个专业，叠加上这几年机器学习和 AI 的潮流，应统更是卷上加卷，而且我们学校电子商务专业的考研上岸率也低，大概只有 7%左右的样子，还都是本校考管科的研究生。这些情况也不得不让我担忧，为自己上不了岸准备后路，不至于一年过后的今天什么都没有。\n目前楼主没有实习经历，也就是这个原因，所以楼主担心在今年的秋招中可能会吃亏，到时秋招找不到工作保底，上岸上不了，直接双输。但是按楼主撰写这篇文章的时间（ 2024.6.6 ）的话，暑期实习可能也有点难找了，想要进好一点的公司也要靠熟人推荐碰碰运气，并且要花点时间来准备面试，这方面留给楼主抉择的时间也不多了，所以有点烦恼。\n楼主现在的抉择\n综合上面的考虑，目前楼主有两个不成熟的想法：\n偏向考研上岸的策略：不准备暑期实习+秋招准备一下简历面试看能不能找到一个保底工作+考暨大经济学院下的应用统计\n偏向拿到工作的策略：想办法找暑期实习看能不能凑出一段实习经历+带着实习经历去秋招+考暨南大学信息科学技术学院下的应用统计\n\"why\"：为什么一个考经济学院下的应统，一个考信息科学技术学院的应统\n是因为两个学院下应统的考研难度不同：信息院难度>经济学研的难度。\n根据楼主想要去的岗位要求，不仅要求学历而且最好有相关的科研产出的话，信息院无疑是要比经济学院要好的，而且也不愿意到时读了两年偏经济的应统硕，没什么相关的论文，最后与岗位的其他人没有竞争优势，浪费两年时间就更亏了。\n所以如何按策略 2 能够稳工作的话，就冲一冲更好的，如何工作不稳的话，就按策略 1 来，起码考研能稳一点，不知道我的想法对不对。\n楼主信息还是闭塞，希望 v 友们对我的规划提提意见，如果有相关数分、数据类岗位的要求、真实的需求现状之类的信息能分享就感激不尽了，如果有暨大应统的学长学姐可以交流就更感动了，第一次发帖希望说的清楚一点，所以废话有点多，v 友多包含。",

The second needs to be a RAW partition of a size large enough to hold the HFS+ image for the recovery environment (usually 1GB or more). It is important that it is a RAW partition, as MakeInstall uses dd to write the contents of the BaseSystem.dmg to the partition - and Windows cannot natively read/write HFS+ - so it needs a blank canvas per se for that data.\n-CorpNewt\n我问题来了，第一个 200MB 分区很容易创建，但是使用 diskgenius 却找不到如何创建“RAW 分区”选项，大家是如何创建这种分区呢？",

          "description": "据媒体报道，6月24日下午，苏州日本人学校的校车遭到了一名外来男子的袭击。这一次持刀伤人案件当中，一对日本的母子受伤。还有一个过去阻拦凶手的中国女子，也被砍成了重伤。\n\r\n\r\n对于这件事情，胡锡进发文发表了他的看法。首先胡锡进先是谴责了那个持刀伤人的凶手，说他这样的行为不仅违反法律，还破坏了中日友好的关系。所以不管怎么说，他都支持对凶手进行严惩，让凶手遭受法律的制裁。同时那个阻拦凶手行凶的中国女子应该是见义勇为，值得我们嘉奖。而且她的做法，也反映了绝大多数中国人的善良。在所有中国人当中，大多数人都是善良的，都是会见义勇为的。\n\r\n\r\n以下为胡锡进微博全文：\n\r\n\r\n\r\n老胡谴责苏州持刀伤人者，并有三点基本判断\n\r\n\r\n第一， 老胡谴责苏州发生的男子砍伤三人事件，无论嫌犯是出于什么目的，是不是故意要针对日本人犯罪，我都要谴责他。如果此人行凶针对的就是日本人，我要说，他的这种动机在中国社会中一定是遭唾弃的。互联网上有一些“反日情绪”，但这绝不代表我们的社会支持对在华日本人采取极端行动。绝大多数中国人不仅坚决支持捍卫法治，而且希望中日两国和平友好，加强各种交流与合作，对日本人在华工作、旅游、生活普遍持欢迎态度。而且我深信，这一态度的主流性不可撼动。\n\r\n\r\n第二， 老胡同意中国官方部门的判断，苏州发生的砍伤一对日本母子和一名校车上中国人的事件，它在中国社会总体上就是偶发的，吉林此前发生的一嫌犯刺伤多名美国人事件也是一样。即使这次行凶者是专门针对日本人，其作案动机的形成在中国庞大社会里也是极其零星的。在大秩序和对外国人普遍友好的态度中，这样的个例绝不具有某种代表性，它就是孤立的，是大环境中的偶然。所以在谴责这起作案的同时，不应当夸大它的意义。就像在其他国家和社会里，也都有受害者是外国人的案件发生，其中有个别是专门以外国人为目标一样。不能因为苏州出了这起事件，就做无边无际的延伸解读。\n\r\n\r\n这起事件中，校车上那名中国女子因阻止行凶，受了最重的伤，仍在抢救中。老胡认为，那名女子现场迸发的英勇阻止反映了绝大多数中国人的善良，以及我们对任何行凶的集体态度。\n\r\n\r\n最后老胡想对网友们说，我们大家要了解，目前中国与日本的关系相对紧张复杂，这个时候发生砍伤日本人的事件，比如果中日彼此关系好的时候，会产生更加敏感的效应。因此这个时候不仅法律会严惩凶犯，咱们大家也要在网上亮明我们社会对这一行凶的唾弃，那将有助于扩大国际上对我们社会里主流对外友好态度的了解，更加相信所发生的案件就是偶然的。\n\r\n\r\n\r\n警方通报“日本公民在苏州遇袭”:犯罪嫌疑人已被刑拘\n\r\n\r\n\r\n苏州市公安局苏州高新区分局发布警情通报：\n\r\n\r\n6月24日16时许，苏州高新区塔园路新地中心公交站台发生一起持刀伤人案件，造成3人受伤（其中1人为中国籍，2人为日本籍）。公安局巡逻警力第一时间到场处置，当场抓获犯罪嫌疑人周某某（男，52岁，为近期从外地来苏州无业人员），并立即将伤者送医救治。\n\r\n\r\n目前，中国籍伤者因在阻止嫌疑人犯罪过程中受伤严重，仍在抢救中；1名日本籍伤者正在治疗，无生命危险，另1名日本籍伤者当日已出院。周某某已被刑事拘留。案件侦办工作正在进一步开展中，将依法依规对犯罪行为予以严惩。",

          "description": "之前有博主在一家平价超市测试100元人民币到底能购买多少生活必需品，该视频引发网友热议，我也写过一篇“100元人民币的购买力”的文章，测试了100元人民币可以在深圳沃尔玛超市购买多少肉蛋奶产品，本篇文章将进一步测试，20美元可以在美国沃尔玛超市购买多少肉蛋奶产品。\n\r\n\r\n沃尔玛是美国最大的连锁超市之一，人们几乎能在这里买到生活所需的任何东西，包括食品、电子设备、家居用品、服装等。同时，沃尔玛售卖的商品都物美价廉且离市区较近，通常也是人们购买生活必需品的第一选择。\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n沃尔玛具有网上超市功能，在网上即可下单，我测试的是洛杉矶沃尔玛的商品价格，不同地区的价格可能不一样。我选择的是以肉蛋奶相关关键词搜索排名前列的商品价格，全都是畅销商品（Best seller），经过测试，20美元可以购买到2.27公斤大米，3.78升牛奶，18个鸡蛋，0.907公斤冷冻蔬菜，0.45公斤碎牛肉。\n\r\n\r\n下面是购买到的详细商品列表和价格。\n\r\n\r\n惠宜长粒强化大米，5磅（2.27公斤），3.52美元。\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n惠宜全脂牛奶，1加仑（3.78升），3.76美元。\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n惠宜无笼鸡蛋，18个，3.82美元。\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n惠宜冷冻蔬菜，32盎司（907克），2.76美元。\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n全天然（80%瘦肉/20%肥肉）碎牛肉，1磅（454克），5.37美元。\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n5件商品合计价格是19.23美元，折合140元人民币。\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n总的来说，从食物营养的角度来看，20美元在洛杉矶沃尔玛的购买力相当不错，一个人吃一周应该没问题，足以满足一个人的基本食品需求。",
