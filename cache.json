Streaming low latency video is painful. I tried mjpeg, Nginx+HLS/DASH, YouTube and Twitch. Twitch is definitely the easiest and best-performing.\n- There's still a few seconds delay between sending your message and the video updating.\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38234746\nPoints: 17\n# Comments: 11",

          "description": "Hi all!  This morning, we released a new Apache 2.0 licensed model on HuggingFace for detecting hallucinations in retrieval augmented generation (RAG) systems.\nWhat we've found is that even when given a \"simple\" instruction like \"summarize the following news article,\" every LLM that's available hallucinates to some extent, making up details that never existed in the source article -- and some of them quite a bit.  As a RAG provider and proponents of ethical AI, we want to see LLMs get better at this.  We've published an open source model, a blog more thoroughly describing our methodology (and some specific examples of these summarization hallucinations), and a GitHub repository containing our evaluation from the most popular generative LLMs available today.  Links to all of them are referenced in the blog here, but for the technical audience here, the most interesting additional links might be:\n- https://huggingface.co/vectara/hallucination_evaluation_mode...\n- https://github.com/vectara/hallucination-leaderboard\nWe hope that releasing these under a truly open source license and detailing the methodology, we hope to increase the viability of anyone really quantitatively measuring and improving the generative LLMs they're publishing.\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38167310\nPoints: 51\n# Comments: 4",

          "description": "Hi there! This is Yury, a co-founder.\nWe've been busy for a while building EdgeDB Cloud and now it's finally here.\nEdgeDB Cloud is pretty cool and takes full advantage of our database. You get declarative schema, strict typing throughout, great performance, a query language that's best of GraphQL & SQL, and many many other perks.\nThe Cloud itself is quite unique because of EdgeDB. Our query language gives you composability - so you can fetch everything for your page or API endpoint in one network request. And our protocol and client libraries give you auto recovery on network errors, automatic transaction retry, built-in transparent connection pooling, and many other benefits.\nCheck out the blog post where we explain it all. And watch the currently ongoing YouTube Premiere of the launch!\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38101649\nPoints: 47\n# Comments: 16",

          "description": "Actually, it is yet another tool to learn a language through immersion (classic set of features, watch on youtube/netflix, read a website or book). It has a popup dictionary so you can click on a word and it will show the definition. Nothing new in that regard, except that it has been made with only Korean in mind and does not plan to extends to other languages.\nI was learning and still am learning Korean (now using my own tool to learn!). I initially made the tool for myself because none of the tools out there could correctly figure out what a word was in the text. And that's where the biggest challenge was: recognizing the lemma.\nA lemma is the dictionary form of a word. An example in English would be \"break, breaks, broke, broken and breaking\" all becoming \"break\". In Korean a word cannot always accurately be returned to the lemma; this might lead to several possibilities. Then the reader, with the context can understand which one ends up being the correct one.\nZero IA was used, pure rules based bruteforcing. I do perhaps intend later to use AI, but as a layer on top. I wanted to make sure I can parse massive amounts with cheap computation first. This open me doors to more crazy ideas for later.\nYou can see a live example on the landing page. Any feedback is appreciated!\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38059396\nPoints: 77\n# Comments: 33",

Leveraging Chroma for vector search with BAAI BGE embeddings, semantically find related verses across the Bible. The tool employs Anthropic's Claude LLM model for generating high-quality summaries of retrieved passages, contextualizing your search topic. Built on a Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) architecture, the app implements a simple Streamlit Web UI using Python. Deployed using render.com, the app is available at https://biblos.app\nNote: Search by just topic/keywords, e.g. \"Kingdom of Heaven\", for broader results!\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38040591\nPoints: 86\n# Comments: 65",

I built a local Python prototyping tool that is finally the Python development environment I've always wanted.\nIt has a Jupyter notebook for data crunching, a database of your choice (Python or MongoDB), and a Streamlit app for building a frontend visualization. You can edit the Streamlit backend via an embedded VSCode editor, or locally on your own IDE.\nThe best part for me is that the database connectors within Jupyter and Streamlit are configured out-of-the-box, so you don't need to spend time thinking about how to tie all that together - you can just pick the database you want to use and get going.\nDisclaimer: I do also work on the tool that deploys all this under the hood, but this project is a personal hackweek project that I threw together so I could develop Python apps on my own\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38038986\nPoints: 40\n# Comments: 2",

          "description": "This is my attempt at helping those who are trying to ditch reddit but have not been satisfied with the content from Lemmy or haven't been able to find the corresponding communities.\nThere are two sides to this project. The first one is that I have setup a Lemmy instance (alien.top) which is mirroring some of the reddit content from subreddits that I wanted to follow with the comments. The difference from most mirroring bots is that, instead of one single bot account mirroring all content, the system creates one account for each reddit user that is being mirrored.\nThe other part of this idea which I believe is more interesting: reddit users can take over their own mirrored bot account on this Lemmy instance. The instance itself does not use the regular registration process, but instead authenticates via Reddit OAuth. If you login through through the \"Portal\", we can then grab your subscribed subreddits and (when it can) find the corresponding Lemmy communities and subscribe you to those automatically. At the moment there are not that Lemmy communities that are being mirrored because I've been the sole user, but hopefully if more people sign-up, it will help to create the network effects and more instance admins will be interested in hosting these \"fediversed\" communities.\nAll of the code is open source (https://github.com/mushroomlabs/fediverser) and I'm more than willing to help people getting their own instances if they don't want to use alien.top itself.\nQuestions and any type of feedback is always welcome!\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38007028\nPoints: 18\n# Comments: 4",

          "description": "Togomak is a command line tool that runs pipelines locally and on the cloud using HashiCorp Configuration Language with a Terraform-like architecture. \nI am a DevOps engineer and I wanted to build something that is CI/CD provider agnostic - something like GNU make, which I could plug into any provider of choice and not have to rewrite anything while retaining its rich features.\nI love Terraform and its ecosystem, so I guess I borrowed a huge chunk of their design. \nTogomak makes parts of your pipeline reusable, by making it a Togomak module, just like Terraform modules. It also gives you power over several HCL functions, loop expressions, templating, and customizing a pipeline according to user input.\nI started this project over a year ago, and over the course, I learned a lot about how Terraform works. Hopefully, some of our other Terraform friends would find this little tool useful!\ntogomak is actually short for \"to-go-and-make\", and it sounds similar to \"tokamak\", a fusion device using magnetic fields to contain hot plasma for energy; perhaps it's containers here!\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38002665\nPoints: 27\n# Comments: 11",

See it in action: https://youtu.be/UypAcozIaoo\nAutotab lets you create browser automations that actually work. We designed it around two principles:\n    1. Show, don’t tell: In a domain like web automation, it's often easier to *show* the model what you want rather than to explain it in sentences.\n\n    2. Code is the best output: Code is easy to inspect and enables manual tweaking of the model’s suggested actions. On top of that, code output avoids lock in and is straightforward to extend and integrate with larger projects.\n\nhttps://github.com/Planetary-Computers/autotab-starter.\nWe'd love to hear what you think!\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37943931\nPoints: 199\n# Comments: 70",

Obviously, this requires for a command to even produce output in JSON, which isn't really the norm (especially for older utilities that predate the concept of JSON).\n What are the thoughts of /r/linux surrounding the concept of object-orientation in your shell?

          "description": "Hello, yesterday I officially released Louvre v1.0.0, a C++ library designed for building Wayland compositors with a primary focus on ease of development. It provides a default method for handling protocols, input events, and rendering, which you can selectively and progressively override as required, allowing you to see a functional compositor from day 1.\n It supports multi-GPU setups, multi-session (TTY switching), and offers various rendering options, including a scene and view system that automatically repaints only the damaged (changing) regions during a frame. Because it uses multiple threads, it can maintain a high FPS rate with v-sync enabled when rendering complex scenarios. In contrast, single-threaded compositors often experience a rapid drop in FPS, for example, from 60 to 30 fps, due to \"dead times\" while waiting for a screen vblank, leading to the skipping of frames.\n The library is freely available, open source, thoroughly documented, includes examples, and features a detailed tutorial.\n You can find it here: https://github.com/CuarzoSoftware/Louvre\n I hope it proves useful for you. If you decide to use it and encounter any doubts or wish to contribute to its development, please don't hesitate to reach out.\n    submitted by    /u/CuarzoSoftware  \n [link]   [comments]",

The last time i used Ubuntu was when Unity was the default DE, and I didn't like Unity, Now, the system is slick, beautiful, functional, everything out of the box, even stuff that I couldn't get to work with Arch (I'm a teacther and I use a smart board on classes, and with Ubuntu it worked out of the box, plug and play). Even the battery is lasting more in Ubuntu than Manjaro. I'm glad to say that I'm back to Ubuntu, apperantely for a long time.\n    submitted by    /u/_good_bot_  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "So I was talking with a colleague of mine a while back and he told me that he didn't use Linux because it was less secure and it was the reason as to why it is not the majority and why Windows is the majority. He claims that Windows is more secure than Linux, however, I claim that it is not the case.\n ​\n So my question is... Do you think Linux is more secure or not? Why? Or Why not?\n I want to know your take on it.\n ​\n My take is that Linux is more secure than MacOS and Windows by a large margin, especially if you know what you are doing. It's why Linux runs most servers. The OS is secure by design.\n ​\n Edit: Thank you everyone who gave their opinions on this argument. I appreciate the fact that you took out of your day to answer this random post with your true opinion. I personally stand with the fact that Linux as a whole is much more secure than Windows can ever be. Especially with being careful of what you install. It may have vulnerabilities, but they can be just as easily patched up as they were discovered. \n ​\n In all honesty, Linux is the superior system for me and I'm glad to be running it on my computer. I've been Windows-free for a couple of weeks now and I'm looking towards being Windows-free for the forseeable future. The only times I'll use Windows is when I need to play certain games or help my colleagues at work, because they use Windows instead.

          "description": "So I’ve been using Fedora Gnome for years now, and wayland has got steadily better to the point of basically being flawless for my fairly simplistic use cases. I love Gnome but my biggest gripe is with its RAM usage. ~1.5GB with no apps open seems silly. So I’m now wanting to try different DEs. KDE seems to use wayland by default now, at least on the Fedora spin, but I’m curious about other people’s experiences of the different DEs under wayland. \n I’m only personally trying Fedora spins, and from what I’ve seen so far, only Gnome and KDE use wayland, but I’m interested in all experiences. \n Another side note, I’m not one for tiling window managers, and generally prefer the more ‘point and click’ DEs, but again I’m still interested in your thoughts\n Edit: a few people have pointed out to me that Gnome isn’t just an obese waste of memory, it is actually doing useful things with the memory it’s using. Indexing and caching is something I hadn’t even considered, and in hindsight Gnome always has been quite snappy to use. That was my point really, I don’t mind using the RAM if I can see benefits to it.

          "description": "I bought an HP Spectre x360 about a year ago. It is the first computer I've ever purchased or owned. Since the day I bought it, I've dealt with overheating issues, performance issues, lagging, fan constantly running, etc. I mean I couldn't open the computer without it turning into an oven... With simple web browsing use. I don't game (I've tried.. not worth it despite the supposedly decent hardware specs), I don't have a ton downloaded. Just web browsing. \n ​\n I took a leap of faith today and converted to Linux as I felt that the security of my PC was compromised despite my best efforts of protecting my personal data. Since install, it has been a whole other experience. My laptop is finally usable. No more random fan kicking on, no more turning into an oven for no reason, it runs so much smoother, and I love how customizable the OS is. I am impressed and also pissed at microsoft for selling me a data collecting piece of hot garbage OS as the flagship for operating systems. \n    submitted by    /u/NotUniqueUsernameee  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "A year in use review\n Lenovo IdeaPad 1 14IGL7 \n CPU - Intel® Pentium® Silver N5030 × 4\n RAM - 4.0 GiB\n HDD - 125.1 GB\n GPU- Intel® UHD Graphics 605 (GLK 3)\n Upon receiving it, I immediately installed Debian 11. After disabling secure boot, the USB installation media completed the installation just fine. I used XFCE as a DE due to limited system resources.\n It’s important to note this device uses a RTL8852BE WiFi adapter and it isn’t recognized by Debian by default. I found a driver with a quick GitHub search and compiled it, this worked just fine. You will need to recompile the driver after each kernel update.\n The system was very snappy and responsive and preformed well for its intended purpose. This device was used to maintain home servers and to carry at work. \n Perhaps the best pro to this device has to be the battery life. I charge it in the morning and use it for around 6 hours without battery depletion. The most I have ever had to charge it was twice in a day and that was with heavy use.\n After 9 months of use, I decided to try OpenSuSE Tumbleweed on it. Everything worked out of the box (WiFi included) with Gnome installed and the system is snappy and responsive. I have continued to use it on this device only because I wanted to work with a rolling distro for a bit. \n I have been satisfied with the experience. This device was purchased from walmart for around USD $120.00\n Pros:\n *Cheap\n *Responsive\n *Very Light Weight\n *Great Battery Life\n Cons:\n *NVME HDD is soldered in\n *WiFi adapter may not be recognized by some distributions\n *Weak hardware for power intensive programs, I would not attempt gaming on this (though my old AoE2 isos worked just fine on it with wine for the slow days at work)\n *Screen is not the best quality but no issues with it\n    submitted by    /u/puppetjazz  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I realize this is a very open-ended and subjective question. That said, I’m curious if there have been any efforts to compare Linux community demographic statistics. And if not that, is there any sort of general sentiment along the lines of “the community around distribution X is known for being very welcoming,” or “the development community building software Y is known for being quite diverse,” etc.? And if not that, I’d love to hear your experience participating in various Linux communities.\n I’ve used Linux servers for almost two decades and desktop Linux off and on for maybe five years, but only ever really in my own bubble. Now attempting to embrace the open source and community ethos, it seems more important to me to find a good community to try to become a part of vs just finding a distro that works well for my use cases, for example.\n    submitted by    /u/davemaps  \n [link]   [comments]",

This means that we can finally have our Apple Silicon moment here on Linux. I am confident the FOSS community would do a far better job than Microsoft with this. I am wondering if current ARM support on Linux is good. I heard somewhere Flatpaks support ARM with something similar to Apple's Rosetta 2. \n Also now that Qualcomm's exclusivity license is expiring on Windows, I expect other manufactures like MediaTek to build ARM chips which is good for competition and more option for us here on Linux. \n ​\n https://preview.redd.it/zbqmaslabyyb1.png?width=795&format=png&auto=webp&s=1572b69bad5789ef50fc4a6ddd0f954f92dd2918\n    submitted by    /u/m_beps  \n [link]   [comments]",

This dual SCM requirement places a significant burden on teams which are already stretched thin in parts. We have made the decision to move Firefox development to Git. \n - We will continue to use Bugzilla, moz-phab, Phabricator, and Lando \n - Although we'll be hosting the repository on GitHub, our contribution workflow will remain unchanged and we will not be accepting Pull Requests at this time \n - We're still working through the planning stages, but we're expecting at least six months before the migration begins \n APPROACH \n In order to deliver gains into the hands of our engineers as early as possible, the work will be split into two components: developer-facing first, followed by piecemeal migration of backend infrastructure. \n Phase One - Developer Facing \n We'll switch the primary repository from Mercurial to Git, at the same time removing support for Mercurial on developers' workstations. At this point you'll need to use Git locally, and will continue to use moz-phab to submit patches for review. \n All changes will land on the Git repository, which will be unidirectionally synchronised into our existing Mercurial infrastructure. \n Phase Two - Infrastructure \n Respective teams will work on migrating infrastructure that sits atop Mercurial to Git. This will happen in an incremental manner rather than all at once. \n By the end of this phase we will have completely removed support of Mercurial from our infrastructure.\n  \n https://groups.google.com/a/mozilla.org/g/firefox-dev/c/QnfydsDj48o/m/8WadV0_dBQAJ\n  \n   submitted by    /u/ainz_47  \n [link]   [comments]",

I don't have any problems using either of these devices on their own and I can function normally in everyday life, just as long as I can avoid frequent switches between the two.

If the user already has organized folders he can skip directly to the parser.\n The script also checks if at least 2MB of free space are available in the path chosen to generate the folders.\n Here is an example with duckstation games, showing also a case where a game needs both .bin and .cue file.\n Before:\n https://preview.redd.it/4s4rat2ym5yb1.png?width=1922&format=png&auto=webp&s=2d3fe9d6d3d0bace62c0ffef4126e4bb9f10efd7\n After:\n ​\n ​\n https://preview.redd.it/d4xzlgxrn5yb1.png?width=1922&format=png&auto=webp&s=e146c7637b6cb2e419a8a9e4caec867673f67900\n ​\n https://preview.redd.it/vt1mje8fn5yb1.png?width=1922&format=png&auto=webp&s=c4e29ca4da873b3d53f1a9e4b395b99410856bb8\n    submitted by    /u/Fabx_  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "There was a small window of timespan when various chat services were popping up, and you could access them all on Linux with Pidgin (or other libpurple-based clients).\n One client, and you could chat with people on ICQ, MSN, Facebook Messenger, AIM, etc. simultaneously.\n These days each chat service has their own rather fat usually-Electron client/embedded in their social service website. Running Slack, Signal, Whatsapp Web, Instagram, Facebook, Discord all the time so you could get notifications is going to eat up a sizeable amount of resources. Not to mention your attention span as you context switch between different chat client UIs.\n I know there are still people writing plugins for Pidgin/libpurple that make these modern chat platforms accessible there, but the functionality just isn't the same. Chat protocols are often complex and/or proprietary to the max these days, and these Pidgin plugins can only replicate a portion of the features supported on the chat platform.\n I know there's the route of self-hosting a Matrix server with bridges for each chat platform, but that's going to take up even more resources.\n Does anyone remember those days when you could use a single client for multiple chat/social platforms? Do you think it's still doable with our current landscape of social platforms?\n    submitted by    /u/JockstrapCummies  \n [link]   [comments]",

One of them requires being able to monitor not only which window on the desktop is the active window, but also retrieving its attributes whenever they change (position, size, title, etc.).\n I've written a Python script that achieves everything I need with regard to the above, but it's doing so using command-line binaries (xinwinfo and xprop).

Today I found this comment on HN about the impact of Electron on Linux:\n  \nCompanies choose Electron to reduce the cost of supporting Windows and Mac, which has the side effect of making Linux supported easily even if the market isn't there. People sure like to complain about Electron but it has been very beneficial for Linux desktops. \n ... \n And that's not mentioning the general shift to using webapps instead of desktop apps (Google Workspace, Office 365, most email services, Jira, Github, Asana…), which obviously makes Linux much more viable.\n  \nI think Linux users like to think that instead of the Electron apps we have, that they would be either native or lean. I think for many of these developers, the demand for them on Linux is way too low to put effort into making their apps work on Linux specifically. I don't know much about Electron's APIs but from what I can tell, it makes supporting Linux trivial.\n    submitted by    /u/TheTwelveYearOld  \n [link]   [comments]",

When I tried to use Wayland WMs I was pretty disappointed, Hyprland was the only one I found to be working decently that had (some) of the features I expected, but I don't want to make the switch until forced, I like dwm much more \n Anyhow, I was wondering if (when) there will ever come a point when I have to drop my dwm config due to it being unusable because of diminishing X11 support by applications. What's the time frame you all expect this to happen?

          "description": "i.e. the ability to add a simple text file to a folder so that I can add keywords to it so that I can actually search through my files. \n I don't know anything about linux phones, but I'm assuming that linux is more intelligent in this avenue as well and thus has that basic function. \n What is with this new generation of technology? It lacks basic features. For example, the YouTube site has a search function on each channel, so you can search all of the titles and descriptions of each video on the channel (and maybe even the audio), but the YouTube app has no such function. And YouTube is owned by the search giant!? \n And this is even more basic: you can't copy text on the YouTube app! \n And they're promoting this app that doesn't have these most basic features as superior? Why can't they at least be honest and say that you should download the app cuz it's faster, but you might get frustrated when you have to switch over to your browser to copy text or search a channel? \n And why can't I add keywords to my bookmarks even on a desktop? Well, I can, but I have to shove them in the title. The old Opera browser had both a 'Nickname' field and an entire 'Description' field!\n    submitted by    /u/PA99  \n [link]   [comments]",

While this is primarily meant to benefit machines with GPU hardware, I've noticed performance using the x264+Mesa software pipeline still far exceeds performance next to 'stock' XRDP. \n The difference is stunning in my tests using KDE and XFCE. You can turn on desktop composition, enable transparency/effects and session windows are still snappy with low latency. Scroll/resize lag is gone. Basic 3D games like TuxRacer are now playable. \n It works with mstsc.exe (Set 32-bit color + LAN link) as well as the macOS RDP client. I have not tested other clients but freerdp should work as well. \n There is a PPA for Ubuntu Jammy/Kinetic and these sources rebuild easily for Debian or Kali. Apparently this will get merged into XRDP -main one day, but will take time due to many changes in the underlying code. \n If you thought RDP on Linux was slow, I highly recommend trying out this branch of XRDP.\n    submitted by    /u/desktopecho  \n [link]   [comments]",

Wasn't sure where to post about it, but this seemed like the best place for the convo.\n The requirement is very much fair, but I've never heard of a piece of software that would actually break it? There's an argument to be made about voice recognition software not picking up voices with uncommon accents or programs lacking accessibility features for disabled users, but those both tend to be instances of design and/or programming that is poor rather than malicious, right? There are more than a few projects we collectively recognize as open source and yet still possess these flaws, so should we not call them as such?\n I could also think of software made for censorship, like the infamous Redstar OS, but while those tools are made to oppress their end users, they don't literally discriminate; their functionality is the same regardless of who uses them, it's an external actor that forces their use upon people. Not only that, but I don't know if it's discrimination if the group you're oppressing is the entire population of your country.\n Thus I'm wondering, are there any notable cases I'm not aware of? I'm fairly young so I may be missing a piece of history here. I'd like if it could start a discussion as it seems interesting.\n    submitted by    /u/MemeTroubadour  \n [link]   [comments]",

With this script however, you could technically use any builds of tabbed + any wm, but I recommend using tabbed-hjc or my tabbed build (which uses the functionality + based on tabbed-flexipatch) as it (normal tabbed) lacks a detach function. I named it tabb instead of tabd as I thought it's not fully matured as a daemon to be named as such and thought tabb (pronounced tab-bee, although I also accept calling it tab).\n    submitted by    /u/Alexis0021a  \n [link]   [comments]",

I already built a client in the same language I'm doing the server in but the Bash version is much more simple\n Come to find out, once I put it on GH, Dylanaraps built one (what's new).. Mine is error trapped and straight to the point though. It's written in pure Bash and unlike Dylan says on his repo, was NOT hard to do. It's very simple actually. Idk wth he did but I simply re-direct input/output to a custom file descriptor and work around the limitations. No & or asynchronous behavior required. I plan to keep it maintained and add more features. It'll be turned into a TUI more than likely but time will tell..\n Currently there is one call to an external command to check username with id -un as a fallback to $USER env. Currently doesn't support TLS but I'll probably add some external shit to make that happen. Yea Bash isn't the most secure and there is better languages for this but it's cool concept and it works elegantly. Plus its just for fun, I have to keep up with my Bash knowledge and it was something I needed to test my server. Very useful for me at the least!\n Anyway let me know what you think.

I've been using Arch as my desktop OS for years but I wouldn't recommend it to anyone who doesn't want to be a sysadmin to his/her system. The same goes for “easy” Arch derivatives, they're only easy to install. Here's an incomplete list of issues a clueless user might encounter:\n  \nThe system hasn't been upgraded for say a month, the keyring package will need to be upgraded first.\n An upgrade requires manual intervention and the user doesn't follow the Arch News.\n One of the worst case scenarios is changes to the bootlader which has happened in the past and again recently (GRUB). Without manual intervention before shutdown, the system would be rendered unbootable.\n The user doesn't really understand how libraries, binaries, packages deps, e.t.c., work, (s)he just tries to install some application after syncing the database, it doesn't run.\n The user tries to install some application but hasn't synced or upgraded for a while, the packages are no longer hosted. This is solved by appending Arch Archive .all to the mirrorlist file.\n The user tries to install some application from the AUR which happen to depend on newer libraries as the system hasn't been upgraded for say some weeks. The application doesn't work or won't even compile.\n The user tries to install some application from the AUR on a freshly upgraded system but the package is out of date, it doesn't work.\n After a system upgrade some AUR packages require a rebuild. Tools like rebuild-dedector with some shell scripts help automate the process.\n A newer kernel breaks something but in Arch kernels are not versioned.\n  \nArch is just not a distro for inexperienced users. “Easy-to-use” Arch derivatives are a disaster waiting to happen for newcomers, especially Manjaro which just introduces issues.\n    submitted by    /u/sindex_  \n [link]   [comments]",

You can install some text-to-speech software and then other software using that API uses that program, though you might need to configure it that way. \n https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/uwp/api/windows.media.speechsynthesis?view=winrt-22621\n Now there are programs using this, and only supporting Windows, since the Linux distros don't have that. I just wanted to bring this to attention, since this might get important pretty fast. People creating any game or program that could run on Linux will not implement this for every TTS software that might exist. I think there should be one API for that, in every desktop environment. Looking forward to opinions and hopefully help to create some attention for this. \n One place where this came to my attention was actually some program but a relatively new and niche programming language with build in functions, for Win32 but not Linux: https://aardappel.github.io/lobster/builtin_functions_reference.html but this might be used for doing WASM, so related to websites, and then it could become a problem for Linux desktop users very fast, if we can't use websites with speech output because of the lack of an OS API and then support for it in the browser, for example. \n    submitted by    /u/NoidoDev  \n [link]   [comments]",

Also even if Adobe does not make a Linux port, people still wont see it as a Linux failing, but more in line the with difference between buying a Mac and a PC, just that this line of Dell's needs you to use different software just like on a Mac.\n ​\n Instead of Linux being seen as \"Windows Light\" for failing to run every single windows app it would be seen as a third choice for people to make. Instead of Linux being the counter culture hacker man OS it is the customization and performance OS for people that are fine using GIMP and Kdenlive over Adobe, just how a mac is the consistent aesthetic OS for people that dont like playing video games or Windows is the OS tat lets you run every app ever made, if you are fine with big brother and horrible bloat. But for the love of god dont scare people by taking about how Linux has 90 compatibility layers for Windows and 80% of all Windows apps work on Linux, because then all people will think is that Linux is trying to be Windows Light and that they are losing out on 20% of software.

I started by trying out the jonaburg fork when i started using a standalone window manager for the first time. It kept crashing everytime i turned off my monitor, so i hopped over to the FT-Labs fork, which has great animations but they didn't work for workspace switching. Then i hopped to the pijulius fork, which did have working animations for workspace switching. Unfortunately, you can't use rounded corners and blur at the same time with that fork, plus it also doesn't have round borders feature, but i decided to just have square corners and call it a day. This week i found out that that the main yshui fork has merged the round borders code, and i started craving rounded corners again, so i'm back on the main picom fork, and decided that the fading effects are good enough for me and i can live without the animations. Seems like you just have to sacrifice something with every fork you use. Well anyway, wanted to end it with a question: do you prefer a particular fork of picom? Or do you perhaps not care about compositing at all and don't use a compositor?\n    submitted by    /u/juipeltje  \n [link]   [comments]",

If you have apps setup to run in the background on startup, they may require you to unlock your keyring. Sure, you can set the keyring password to be blank but this is not a good idea for security reasons.\n This was my idea to solve this. It will require the computer to be setup to be fully encrypted however.\n The auto login users keyring password will be stored and be encrypted using the system encrypted password. When the computer is booted up and unlocked, it will decrypt the keyring password and use that to unlock the users keyring when logging into the user.\n This way the keyring gets unlocked but the keyring password is stored secure and not in plain text.\n Not sure the best place to make this feature request?

You can read slightly more context on my blog post but I just wanted to share the function here.\n tmac () { tmux has-session -t \"$1\" 2>/dev/null if [ $? != 0 ]; then tmux new-session -s \"$1\" -d fi tmux attach -t \"$1\" } _tmac_complete() { local word=${COMP_WORDS[COMP_CWORD]} local sessions=$(tmux list-sessions -F \"#{session_name}\" 2>/dev/null) COMPREPLY=( $(compgen -W \"$sessions\" -- \"$word\") ) } complete -F _tmac_complete tmac \n This command allows you to easily use your bash history to attach to sessions you launch, it allows you to essentially use tmux ls within your attach command just by hitting tab. For whatever reason, tmux attach allows you to attach based on a prefix but it doesn't autocomplete so if you have more than one session wit the same prefix it won't let you know. The final command combines tmux ls, tmux new-session, and tmux attach into a single convenient command: tmac.\n    submitted by    /u/celeritas365  \n [link]   [comments]",

The user should have the right to choose, and that should extend to their choice desktop environments as well. \n UBXI, put simply, is a way for our users to maintain their own desktop environment packages and distribution spins. Unicorn is more than just the XFCE base it was built on, it’s an idea that helps to improve the Rhino Linux desktop experience, and Rhino Linux is more than the desktop environment the user interacts with. \n Read more: https://rhinolinux.org/news-9.html\n    submitted by    /u/MrBeeBenson  \n [link]   [comments]",

Coleridge，1772-1834）是英国诗史上一位以极少量的经典诗作而名垂后世的大诗人。他一生共创作了三百来首诗歌，但为人称道的作品不过十来首，而真正被视为无可复制的杰作的只有《忽必烈汗》（Kubla Khan）、《克里斯德蓓》（Christabel）和《古舟子咏》（The Rime of the Ancient Mariner）这三首魔魅诗篇（daemonic poems）。前两首均是未完成的残篇，唯有《古舟子咏》是完篇，以古民谣的风格有始有终地讲述了一个水手无故杀害一只信天翁，随后同行的两百个水手离奇毙命而自己却侥幸生还的曲折故事。早在上世纪二三十年代，诗人朱湘就有过译介（译稿完成于二十年代末留美期间，不过直到1935年才发表于其译诗遗集《番石榴集》），八十年代后又有吕千飞、杨德豫、屠岸等诸位先生的译本，其中以杨德豫的译本最受欢迎。不过，翻译只能无限靠近原作，世上恐无绝对完美的译本。早先的译本可能存在着理解上的错误，并且随着时代的变迁，会出现用语滞后的情况。理想的情况是经典的作品不时有新的译本出现，这既是向原作者的致敬，也是对前辈译者的告慰。叶紫老师的最新译作《古舟子咏》（江苏凤凰文艺出版社，2022年）参照的版本权威、译文准确、配图新颖、导读经典，在我看来就是一次成功的重译。\n原诗版本变迁略述\n柯勒律治有改诗的癖好。姑且不论作品出版前的反复润色，就是在出版后，他还要不停修改。《古舟子咏》的版本众多，据权威统计，诗人生前共有十八个版本印行（Jack Stillinger, Coleridge and Textual Instability: The Multiple Versi…",

Howell, What the Doctors Read, Journal of Health Politics, Policy and Law, 2004, 29[4]: 781-797）。在该书出版二十周年之际，《卫生行政、政策和法律杂志》甚至专门组织一期特刊，邀请各个学界学者来重新评估该书的价值。\n二十世纪下半叶，围绕医疗职业的社会学研究已经十分丰富，为什么《美国医疗的社会变迁》能在诸多著作中脱颖而出？我想答案在于这本书高度具体化的提问方式。有别于之前的两种研究取向，即定义职业和寻找职业化的标准路径，斯塔尔将美国医疗职业地位的历史变动视作核心问题，在挖掘了不同时期医疗职业特征的同时，阐明这一特征的生成过程。在此框架下，作者不再坚持单一线性叙事过程和将医疗职业假定为稳定且边界清晰的社会实体，而是呈现出历史特定时刻不同社会实体与医疗领域内部群体的互动过程，并且将其互动结果的产生作为每章回答的研究问题。在下文中，我将首先阐述英美医疗职业研究的学术脉络及其存在的缺陷，再以经验分析的前三章为例，呈现斯塔尔的提问方式如何做到将因果性聚集于历史叙事当中，进而弥补过去研究的不足。\n在英美专业社会学领域，对于医学专业的关注由来已久。较早开…",

          "description": "40 年前，微软宣布 Windows 开发计划\n\r\n在 40 年前，1983 年 11 月 10 日，在纽约市的一次新闻发布会上，微软首次披露了其推出基于图形用户界面的全新 PC 操作系统的计划。公司将该操作系统命名为 “Windows”。虽然微软希望在 1984 年 4 月推出 Windows，但第一个版本却是在首次宣布两年后才上市。有趣的是，微软最初希望 Windows 应用程序可以重叠显示，但是最终在 Windows 1.0 中采用的是平铺式窗口，应用程序会自动调整其大小以适应屏幕，所以，现在的一些 Linux 平铺桌面环境还真不是什么创举。该操作系统在头两年的销售量仅为 50 万套，销售失败。事实上，直到 1990 年 Windows 3.0 的发布，该操作系统才真正取得了成功。\n\r\n\r\n消息来源：NeoWin\n\r\n\r\n\r\n老王点评：我用的第一个图形化桌面操作系统已经是 Windows 3.1 ，其底层运行的是 DOS 6.2.2。\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n苹果公司为在 iOS 上侧载应用做准备\n\r\niOS 17.2 有了一个新的公共框架，名为 “托管应用分发”。通过分析这个 API，发现了一个新的、未使用的权限，它将允许第三方应用程序安装其他应用程序。换句话说，这将允许开发者创建自己的应用商店。该 API 具有基本的控制功能，可以下载、安装甚至更新来自外部的应用程序。它还可以检查应用程序是否与特定设备或 iOS 版本兼容。根据欧盟的《数字市场法案》（DMA），大型科技公司除其他事项外，还必须允许用户从第三方来源安装任何他们想要的应用程序。理论上，苹果公司必须在 2024 年 3 月之前遵守 DMA 法规。\n\r\n\r\n消息来源：9to5mac\n\r\n\r\n\r\n老王点评：即便支持，也可能只是在欧盟支持。\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n微软禁止内部使用 OpenAI 的 ChatGPT\n\r\n由于安全方面的担忧，微软暂时取消了对 OpenAI 的 ChatGPT 的内部访问权限，试图在公司设备上访问 ChatGPT 的员工被转到了微软封锁该网站的通知页面。微软称，“出于安全和数据方面的考虑，一些人工智能工具已不再供员工使用”。微软表示，它积极鼓励内部和客户使用必应聊天企业版（它使用的是 ChatGPT 企业版），因为它提供了更强大的隐私保护。此外，摩根大通、Verizon 和苹果公司也阻止了内部使用 OpenAI 的 ChatGPT。\n\r\n\r\n消息来源：The Register\n\r\n\r\n\r\n老王点评：AI 越好用，其对企业内部数据的攫取就越多，这可比搜索引擎可怕多了。",

          "description": "作为领先的开源桌面操作系统，Fedora Workstation 由全球社区共同携手打造。本文将向你展示最新版本 Fedora Workstation 39 主要的用户所能见到的变化。如今，你可以在 Fedora Workstation 官方网页 下载体验，或是通过在“软件”应用内或使用 dnf system-upgrade 在你喜爱的终端模拟器进行升级。\n\r\nGNOME 45\n\r\nFedora Workstation 39 搭载了 GNOME 的最新版本——GNOME 45。这个版本为几个核心应用带来了时尚的新插件、全新的图像查看器应用、新增了在特定系统上的键盘背光设置等。同时，我们的一个更具信息性的活动按钮，及多项性能改进，将伴随全面优化的整套用户体验而来。你可以在 GNOME 45 发布说明 查看更多详细信息。\n\r\n内在改进\n\r\nGNOME 45 在用户体验的方方面面都有所细化，以下几点只是其中的一部分：\n\r\n\r\n\r\n使用动态工作空间指示器取代了静态的活动按钮。新的指示器不仅显示工作空间数量，而且还能快速展示你正在关注的工作空间。\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n\r\n新增了一个摄像头活动指示器，要启用它，你可以通过 Pipewire 访问你的摄像头。这将与麦克风、屏幕录制和屏幕录像指示器协同工作。\n\r\n\r\n\r\n快速设置菜单新增了一个键盘背光设置，这项设置仅支持特定的硬件设备。\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n\r\n重新设计了默认的光标，并修复了原来设置中很多长期存在的问题。\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFedora Workstation 39 已不再支持 Adwaita-qt 与 QGnomePlatform Qt 主题，取而代之的是 Qt 应用的上游默认主题。\n\r\n\r\n\r\n核心应用\n\r\n在 GNOME 45，许多应用现在使用了 libadwaita 1.4 特色的新用户界面插件。这提供了美观的双色设计并将侧边栏延伸至窗口全高。这不仅使应用看起来更酷，而且在小窗口尺寸下更易于使用。可在 此处 查看详细信息。此外，新的 headerbar 插件使顶栏与窗口内容的视觉分隔更加明显。\n\r\n\n\r\nFedora Workstation 39 引入了 GNOME 的新图像查看器应用，内部代号为 Loupe。该应用自底而上，使用 Rust、GTK 4，和 libadwaita 进行构建以实现高性能和高度适应性。\n\r\n\n\r\n在核心应用中我们还有很多细微的改进。例如：\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“设置”应用新增了“系统详情”区块，新的键盘布局查看器，简洁的描述字段，以及优化的键盘导航功能。\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n\r\n在“文件”应用中，我们对搜索结果进行了顺序优化。\n\r\n\r\n\r\n我们在“软件”应用中提供了卸载 Flatpak 时删除用户数据的选项。\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“日历”应用新增了逐行滚动和更有用的搜索结果功能。\n\r\n\r\n\r\n在“连接”应用中使用 RDP 连接时新增了复制文件、图像、文本的功能。\n\r\n\r\n\r\n性能改进\n\r\n在 GNOME 45，我们对性能提升投入了很多努力。\n\r\n\r\n现在默认优先使用硬件加速的视频解码（在支持的环境下）。\n\r\n“文件”应用中的缩略图生成现在支持多线程处理。\n\r\n我们显著减少了光标的卡顿和延迟。\n\r\n在 GNOME Shell 中，以及“文件”、“软件”、“字符”等应用的搜索性能得到显著提升。\n\r\n\r\n我们在整个技术栈中也进行了一些性能改进，包括 GLib、GTK 的 OpenGL 渲染器，和 systemd。这些性能优化工作都得益于我们在 Fedora Workstation 之前的版本中启用的帧指针！\n\r\nFedora Linux 39 的底层突破\n\r\nFedora Linux 39 也有许多值得注意的底层变化，此处列出一些：\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFedora Linux 39 现在将彩色 Bash 提示符作为默认设置！\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n\r\n对于使用 Indic 脚本的语系，我们现在把 Noto 字体作为默认字体，取代了旧的 Lohit 字体集。\n\r\n\r\n\r\n由于使用量较低且缺乏主动维护，模块化 仓库在 Fedora Linux 39 中不再被提供。\n\r\n\r\nFedora 模块构建服务将在 Fedora Linux 38 的生命周期结束后，也就是在 2024 年的 5 月左右结束。\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n（题图：MJ/f06d0e9b-4c2e-4947-8333-e51340a45324）\n\r\n\r\nvia: https://fedoramagazine.org/whats-new-fedora-workstation-39/\n\r\n作者：Merlin Cooper 选题：lujun9972 译者：ChatGPT 校对：wxy\n\r\n本文由 LCTT 原创编译，Linux中国 荣誉推出",

          "description": "想在 Ubuntu 上使用最新、最好的 LibreOffice？这里有一个简单的方法。\n\r\n\r\nLibreOffice 已预装在 Ubuntu 中。\n\r\n不过，如果你选择了最小化的 Ubuntu 安装，或者卸载它并安装了其他办公套件，你可以使用此命令轻松安装：\n\r\nsudo apt install libreoffice\r\n\n\r\n这没问题。但 Ubuntu 仓库提供的 LibreOffice 版本可能不是最新的。\n\r\n如果你听说有新的 LibreOffice 版本发布，很可能你不会获得该新版本。这是因为 Ubuntu 将其保持在稳定版本上。\n\r\n这对大多数用户来说都很好。但是，如果你不是“大多数用户”，并且你想在 Ubuntu 中获取最新的 LibreOffice，那么你完全可以这样做。\n\r\n有两种方法可以做到这一点：\n\r\n\r\n使用官方 PPA（推荐）\n\r\n从 LibreOffice 下载 deb 文件\n\r\n\r\n让我们来看看。\n\r\n方法 1：通过官方 PPA 安装最新的 LibreOffice（推荐）\n\r\n你可以使用官方 “LibreOffice Fresh” PPA 在基于 Ubuntu 的发行版上安装 LibreOffice 的最新稳定版本。\n\r\nPPA 提供了 LibreOffice 的最新稳定版本，而不是开发版本。因此，这使其成为在 Ubuntu 上获取较新 LibreOffice 版本的理想选择。\n\r\n你甚至不需要使用此方法卸载以前的版本。它将把现有的 LibreOffice 更新到新版本。\n\r\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:libreoffice/ppa\r\nsudo apt update\r\nsudo apt install libreoffice\r\n\n\r\n由于你要添加 PPA，因此你还将获得以这种方式安装的新版本的更新。\n\r\n方法 2：从网站获取二进制文件（如果需要）\n\r\n你可以随时前往 LibreOfiice 网站的下载页面 下载最新版本的 deb 文件。你还会看到下载较旧但 LTS 稳定版本的选项。\n\r\n\n\r\n我相信你已经 知道如何从 deb 文件安装应用。右键单击 deb 文件，选择使用软件中心打开它。进入软件中心后，你可以单击安装按钮进行安装。\n\r\n结论\n\r\n第二种方法的缺点是，如果有更新，你必须再次下载 deb 文件，删除以前的 LibreOffice 版本，然后使用新下载的 deb 文件安装新版本。\n\r\n相比之下，PPA 会随着系统更新而自动更新。这就是我推荐 PPA 的原因，特别是当它由 LibreOffice 团队自己维护时。\n\r\n顺便说一句，这里有一些 充分利用 LibreOffice 的技巧：\n\r\n\r\n提高 LibreOffice 生产力的技巧\n\r\n\r\n我希望这个快速技巧可以帮助你在基于 Ubuntu 的发行版上获取最新的 LibreOffice。如果你有疑问，请告诉我。\n\r\n\r\nvia: https://itsfoss.com/install-libreoffice-ubuntu/\n\r\n作者：Abhishek Prakash 选题：lujun9972 译者：geekpi 校对：wxy\n\r\n本文由 LCTT 原创编译，Linux中国 荣誉推出",

          "description": "最重要的计算机视觉库 OpenCV 众筹新版本，应者寥寥\n\r\nOpenCV 是一个开源的计算机视觉和机器学习软件库。据报告，89% 的嵌入式视觉工程师使用 OpenCV 作为主要的计算机视觉库。为了筹集完成和发布其重要 5.0 版本所需的资金，OpenCV 团队宣布发起一项众筹活动。OpenCV 5.0 原本是 20 周年纪念版本，最初计划于 2020 年发布，但要完成这个版本，需要很多资金。他们设立了 50 万美元的众筹目标，他们也希望“向其他陷入困境的开源项目证明众筹是一个可行的选择，而不仅仅依赖企业捐赠”。不过，这次的众筹于 10 月 24 日开始，十天过去了，才仅仅完成 5% 的目标。\n\r\n\r\n消息来源：i-Programmer\n\r\n\r\n\r\n老王点评：依靠 OpenCV 吃饭的人不少，但是都不愿意帮助它活下去。\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n科学家建议将闰秒变成几十年才需要调整一次的闰分\n\r\n由于以地球自转为基础的天文钟和铯原子钟之间存在偏差，自 1972 年以来，每隔几年就通过插入闰秒来同步这两个时间 —— 让原子钟短暂停顿一下，让天文钟赶上。这就产生了 UTC，即世界协调时。但很难准确预测何时需要闰秒，这让科技公司、国家和世界计时员越来越头疼。美国国家标准与技术研究院负责网络时间同步的 朱达·莱文Judah Levine 提出了一个新的解决方案：闰一分钟。这样可以减少时钟同步的频率，也许每半个世纪才需要同步一次，而在此期间基本上忘掉它。\n\r\n\r\n消息来源：《纽约时报》\n\r\n\r\n\r\n老王点评：最初的闰秒设计是一个直觉方案，现在看起来没有考虑到科技发展这么快，以至于大量的科技设施需要依赖精确而一致的时间。\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n企业称 Meta 的免费人工智能并不便宜\n\r\n一些为 OpenAI 人工智能付费的公司一直在寻求使用免费的开源替代品来降低成本。在 Meta 公司发布了开源的大型语言模型 Llama 2 之后，业界对此感到非常兴奋。但企业发现，他们为此向谷歌云一个月支付了 1200 美元，而使用 GPT-3.5 Turbo 处理相同的工作量每月才需要花费约 5 美元。企业发现，使用开箱即用的 Llama 2 的成本比 OpenAI 的 GPT-3.5 Turbo 高 50% 到 100%；而只有那些希望通过对数据进行训练来定制 LLM 的公司，才会选择开源方案 —— 在这种情况下，定制 Llama 2 模型的成本约为定制 GPT-3.5 Turbo 模型的四分之一。\n\r\n\r\n消息来源：The Information\n\r\n\r\n\r\n老王点评：一方面我相信 OpenAI 和 Azure 都为 AI 客户提供了大量的补贴，所以使用 GPT 会比 Llama 2 更便宜。另外一方面，当你需要定制，并且有定制的能力时，开源的 Llama 2 可能更适合你。",

          "description": "你认为开源许可证应当进行演变吗？\n\r\n\r\n2023 年，我们以人工智能（AI）崭露头角开始了新的一年，同时也见证了众多公司全力以赴投身于 AI。\n\r\n比如说 Mozilla，它在 2023 年初制定了 开源 AI 计划，以开发各种 AI 驱动的解决方案。而 HuggingChat 也成为了第一个推出 ChatGPT 开源替代品 的组织。\n\r\n即便是 Meta，他们也不例外。他们自家的 大型语言模型Large Language Model（LLM）Llama 2 项目在这一年都颇受关注，几个月前他们甚至推出了一款新的 ChatGPT 竞争对手。\n\r\n然而，也有很多人开始 提出质疑，主张 Meta 的 Llama 2 模型并不像人们期望的那样开放，查看它的开源许可证似乎更是印证了这个观点。\n\r\n该许可证 不允许拥有超过 7 亿日活跃用户的服务使用 Llama 2，同样的，它也不能被用于训练其他的语言模型。\n\r\n这也就意味着 Meta 对于 Llama 2 的许可证 未能满足 开源倡议组织Open Source Initiative（OSI）的 开源定义Open Source Definition（OSD）所列出的 全部要求。\n\r\n人们可以争辩，像 EleutherAI 和 Falcon 40B 这样的机构就做出了很好的示范，展示了如何适当地处理 AI 的开源许可。\n\r\n然而，Meta 对此的看法却截然不同。\n\r\n开源许可需要进化\n\r\n在与 The Verge 的交谈中，Meta 人工智能研究副总裁 Joëlle Pineau 为他们的立场进行了辩解。\n\r\n她说，我们 需要在信息共享的益处和可能对 Meta 商业造成的潜在成本之间寻找平衡。\n\r\n这种对开源的态度让他们的研究人员能够更加专注地处理 AI 项目。她还补充说：\n\r\n\r\n开放的方式从内部改变了我们的科研方法，它促使我们不发布任何不安全的东西，并在一开始就负起责任。\n\r\n\r\nJoëlle 希望他们的生成型 AI 模型能够和他们过去的 PyTorch 项目一样受到热捧。\n\r\n但是，问题在于现有的许可证机制。她又补充说，这些许可证并不是设计来处理那些需要利用大量多源数据的软件。\n\r\n这反过来为开发者和用户提供了有限责任，以及，对版权侵犯的有限赔偿（解释为：保护）。\n\r\n此外，她还指出：\n\r\n\r\nAI 模型与软件不同，涉及的风险更大，因此我认为我们应该对当前用户许可证进行改变，以更好地适应 AI 模型。\n\r\n但我并不是一名律师，所以我在此问题上听从他们的意见。\n\r\n\r\n我赞同她的观点，我们需要更新现有的许可方案，使之更好地适应 AI 模型，以及其他相关事务。\n\r\n显而易见，OSI 正在努力进行此事。OSI 的执行董事 Stefano Maffulli 向 The Verge 透露，他们了解到 当前的 OSI 批准的许可证无法满足人工智能模型的需求。\n\r\n他们正在商讨如何与 AI 开发者合作，以提供一个 “透明、无许可但安全” 的模型访问。\n\r\n他还补充说：\n\r\n\r\n我们肯定需要重新思考许可证的方式，以解决 AI 模型中版权和授权的真正限制，同时仍遵循开源社区的一些原则。\n\r\n\r\n无论未来如何，显然，开源标准必须推动其演化，以适应新的以及即将出现的技术 ，而此类问题不仅仅局限于 AI。\n\r\n对于未来几年开源许可的变革，我充满期待。\n\r\n💬 对于你来说呢？你认为对于陈旧的开源标准，我们需要进行什么样的改变？\n\r\n（题图：MJ/e8bae5f6-606b-47db-aaea-c992c0bd143e）\n\r\n\r\nvia: https://news.itsfoss.com/open-source-definition-ai/\n\r\n作者：Sourav Rudra 选题：lujun9972 译者：ChatGPT 校对：wxy\n\r\n本文由 LCTT 原创编译，Linux中国 荣誉推出",

          "description": "德国法庭裁决浏览器的“请勿跟踪”具有法律约束力\n\r\n德国一家地区法院裁定，微软旗下的 LinkedIn 不能再无视用户在浏览器中的 “请勿跟踪Do Not Track” 设置。“请勿追踪” 是一个允许用户启用的 HTTP 头字段，启用该字段向网站的服务器表明不希望被追踪。但“请勿追踪”被认为并不具有约束力，网站可以选择尊重用户的决定。LinkedIn 在网站上明确表示：由于目前没有“请勿追踪”的相关标准，它对该信号不予回应。德国消费者权益组织 vzbv 称，LinkedIn 的声明（即不遵守 “请勿追踪” 偏好）违反了 GDPR。它指出，如果消费者启用了浏览器的请勿追踪功能，那么他们发出了一个明确的信号：不希望其上网行为被跟踪用于广告等目的，网站运营者必须尊重这一信号。法官同意了这一意见。\n\r\n\r\n消息来源：Tech HQ\n\r\n\r\n\r\n老王点评：这是非常明确的声明，这个裁定为各国法院做出了表率。\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n谷歌承诺为安卓 14 的 “勒索软件” 漏洞提供救援补丁\n\r\n由于安卓 14 中存在的一个缺陷，当安卓设备有多个用户时，会导致设备被锁定，就像被安装了勒索软件一样。该缺陷最初报告给谷歌时，并没有引起重视，但随着该缺陷被媒体多轮报道，该漏洞的级别从 P2 升级到了最高优先级的 P0，并已交由专人处理。谷歌已经发布了相关的 Play 系统的补丁，但问题在于 Play 系统的更新不会主动应用，甚至不会让你知道它们已被下载。所以需要受影响的用户手动检查更新并安装。\n\r\n\r\n消息来源：Ars Technica\n\r\n\r\n\r\n老王点评：连技术漏洞都需要媒体监督才能有人重视。\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n苹果宣布了 M3 系列芯片及搭载该芯片的新 MacBook Pro\n\r\n苹果称，M3、M3 Pro 与 M3 Max 是全球首批使用 3 纳米工艺的 PC 芯片。第一代 M1 芯片进行了对比，M3 的高性能核心和高能效核心比 M1 中的相应核心分别快 30% 和 50%，神经网络引擎也比 M1 系列芯片上的快 60%，图形处理器渲染速度比 M1 系列芯片相比最快可达 2.5 倍。M3 系列芯片最大变化就是其图形处理器，在功耗减半的情况下可达到与 M1 相当的性能，在峰值功耗下可实现 65% 的性能提升。\n\r\n\r\n消息来源：The Verge\n\r\n\r\n\r\n老王点评：苹果的 M 芯片确实很棒，而且事实上揭开了 Arm 芯片在个人计算机上的时代。",

          "description": "Moosync 音乐播放器是一个适用于本地收藏与流媒体音乐的魅力十足的跨平台应用。\n\r\n\r\n想听好音乐吗？🎶\n\r\n首次亮相的跨平台开源音乐播放器 Moosync ，希望成为“欢迎全社区参与”的音乐播放器。\n\r\n过去我们曾介绍过像 Harmonoid 和 MusicPod 这样的应用，但是它们主要是专注于离线使用。\n\r\n与之不同的是，Moosync 的独特之处。让我告诉你为什么。\n\r\nMoosync：概况 ⭐\n\r\n\n\r\nMoosync 是一个主要基于 Vue 和 TypeScript 编程语言开发的音乐播放器。\n\r\nMoosync 高度可定制且支持 YouTube、Spotify 以及 LastFM 等多种服务。其关键特性包含：\n\r\n\r\n支持显示歌词\n\r\n无广告播放\n\r\n支持本地音乐文件\n\r\n\r\n初次体验 👨‍💻\n\r\n在我在我的 Ubuntu 系统上安装它之后，我开始了快速设置向导。\n\r\n首先设定我的音乐库的位置，它将会从此处获取本地音乐文件，过程包含了许多步骤。\n\r\n\n\r\n然后，显示了可以连接的服务选项。\n\r\n我试图连接我的 Spotify 账户，然而尽管我向 Moosync 提供了需要的信息，操作无法成功。不过幸运的是，这一步并非必要，所以我选择跳过。\n\r\n\n\r\n随后，它显示了空白的 “所有歌曲All Songs” 标签页，由于目前我未连接任何服务或者本地文件，所以这里是空的。\n\r\n\n\r\n考虑我没有本地音乐或 Spotify 音乐，我点击了 YouTube 过滤器并搜寻我喜欢的曲目以填充 Moosync。\n\r\n搜索功能还包括歌曲、艺术家、播放列表和专辑的过滤器。\n\r\n\n\r\n我可以以右键点击单曲，并添加至播放队列或者立即播放。除此之外还有其他选项，会有所不同。\n\r\n\n\r\n我在 Spotify 数据库进行搜索时，尝试做相同操作，但不幸的是，我必须要登录 Spotify 才能在 Moosync 使用它 这一计划之前被搁置。\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n📋 如果你在寻找更好的 Spotify 支持，我建议你尝试一下 BlackHole 这个音乐应用。\n\r\n\r\n而我选择继续，去了解这个音乐播放器。进入 “队列Queue” 标签页或者点击应用程序右下角向上指向的箭头都可以访问它。\n\r\n整齐的布局使人感到熟悉和舒适。\n\r\n\n\r\n在 “所有歌曲All Songs” 标签页，我添加进 Moosync 的所有歌曲都在这，我可以选择从列表开头播放，或者添加到当前队列，甚至可以在其中随机播放 100 首歌曲。\n\r\n\n\r\n在 “播放列表Playlists” 标签页，我保存的所有来自 YouTube 的播放清单都在这。它还提供了本地文件和 YouTube 间的排序选项。\n\r\n\n\r\n在 “专辑Albums” 标签页，我保存的所有专辑都以一个整齐的网格布局排列。\n\r\n\n\r\n类似的，“艺术家Artists” 标签页展示了我添加到 Moosync 库的艺术家。出于某种原因，它没有加载缩略图。\n\r\n“类别Genres” 标签页我也跳过了，因为它似乎不能正常工作。\n\r\n\n\r\n最后是 “探索Explore” 标签页，这里显示了我听过多少分钟的音乐。\n\r\n\n\r\n此外，你可以在 Moosync 中找到许多有用的自定义设置来优化你的使用体验。\n\r\n首先在 “主题Theme”设置中，你可以在三个主题和两种布局视图中选择，还有选项上传或设计自定义主题。\n\r\n\n\r\n应用还有许多扩展，一种是在 Discord 上开启丰富的存在支持，另一种是与 Soundcloud 集成，此外还有很多。\n\r\n\n\r\n显然，Moosync 支持键盘快捷方式，你可以根据个人的喜好进行设置。\n\r\n\n\r\n在我写这篇文章的时候，Moosync 这里和那里都有一些小瑕疵，但我认为它作为 最适合 Linux 的音乐播放器之一 的竞争者非常有竞争力。\n\r\n📥 下载 Moosync\n\r\nMoosync 适用于 Linux，Windows 以及 macOS。你可以在其官方网站下载你需要的安装包。\n\r\n\r\nMoosync\n\r\n\r\n对于 Linux 用户，你也可以在 Flathub 商店，Snap 商店 和 AUR 下载 Moosync。\n\r\n你还可以浏览他们的 GitHub 仓库，获取源代码以及更多信息。\n\r\n💬 对这款应用有何看法？欢迎在评论区告诉我。\n\r\n\r\nvia: https://news.itsfoss.com/moosync/\n\r\n作者：Sourav Rudra 选题：lujun9972 译者：ChatGPT 校对：wxy\n\r\n本文由 LCTT 原创编译，Linux中国 荣誉推出",

          "description": "思考一下，如何在你的开源项目中真正定义安全性吧。\n\r\n\r\n科技行业以创造“热词”而小有名气，当然，其他行业也是如此。譬如，“故事驱动”和“轻规则”是当下流行的桌游概念，“解构”的汉堡和墨西哥卷饼在高级餐厅颇受欢迎。然而，技术热词的问题在于，它们可能直接影响你的生活。当某人标榜应用程序“安全”，以此来吸引你使用他们的产品，产品实际上是在暗示一种承诺：“安全”的含义就是它是安全的，它值得你的使用与信任。但问题是，“安全”这个词可能指的是许多事情，技术行业常将它用作一个过于泛化的术语，以至于它逐渐失去了实际含义。\n\r\n由于“安全”一词可能含义丰富，也可能一无是处，使用它就需要慎之又慎。事实上，最好是尽量避免使用这个词，取而代之的是，诉诸你真正要表达的东西。\n\r\n当 “安全” 意味着加密\n\r\n有时候，“安全” 会被作为 加密 的非常不明确的简短表述。在这种情况下，“安全” 指的是，对于外部观察者想要窃听你的数据，要经过一定的困难。\n\r\n避免这样表述：“本网站稳如磐石且安全无忧。”\n\r\n听起来很棒？你可能会想象一个拥有多重二次验证、零知识证明数据存储以及坚决的匿名策略的网站。\n\r\n你可以这么说：“本网站承诺有 99% 的在线时间，并且其流量都通过 SSL 进行加密和验证。”\n\r\n这样一来，承诺的含义变得清晰了，同时也明确了实现 “安全” 的方法（即使用 SSL）以及 “安全“ 的作用范围是什么。\n\r\n注意，这里并未对隐私或匿名做出任何明确的承诺。\n\r\n当 “安全” 意味着访问限制\n\r\n有时，“安全” 这个词是指应用程序或设备的访问权限。如果没有明确的解释，“安全” 可能涵盖从无效的“隐蔽即安全”模式，到简单的 htaccess 密码，直到生物识别扫描器等各种概念。\n\r\n避免这样表述：“我们已经为你防护好了系统。”\n\r\n你可以这么说：“我们的系统采用了二步验证法。”\n\r\n当 “安全” 意味着数据存储\n\r\n“安全” 这个词也可以指你的数据在服务器或设备上的储存方法。\n\r\n避免这样表述：“这个设备在数据存储上考虑了安全因素。”\n\r\n你可以这么说：“这个设备利用全盘加密技术来保护你的数据。”\n\r\n当提到远程存储时，“安全” 可能更多指的是谁可以访问存储数据。\n\r\n避免这样表述：“你的数据是安全的。”\n\r\n你可以这么说：“你的数据经过 PGP 加密，仅你持有私钥。”\n\r\n当 “安全” 意味着隐私\n\r\n今天，“隐私” 一词几乎和 “安全” 一样宽泛且模糊。一方面，“安全” 似乎必然就涉及 “隐私”，然而，这仅在 '安全' 有明确定义时才成立。是因为设有密码阻止外人进入所以称之为私有吗？还是因为数据已加密且仅你拥有密钥所以归为私有？又或者，由于存储你数据的厂商除了 IP 地址外对你一无所知，这才算是私有？光是口头声明 “隐私”，就像未经说明就声明 “安全” 一样，是不够的。\n\r\n避免这样表述：“你的数据在我们这里是安全的。”\n\r\n你可以这么说：“你的数据经 PGP 加密，且只有你拥有私钥。我们不需要你的任何个人信息，唯一能识别你的只有你的 IP 地址。”\n\r\n一些网站会声明 IP 地址在日志中保留期限，及非经法律授权绝不向执法部门交出用户数据等诸多承诺。虽然这些并不属于技术 “安全” 的范畴，但它们全都涉及的是信任度，你不能将这些看作是技术规格。\n\r\n明确所说\n\r\n科技是个复杂的话题，极易引发混淆。沟通是至关重要的，虽然有时候简拼和专有名词在某些场合可能管用，但通常来说，讲明白总是比较好的。当你对你的项目的 “安全” 感到自豪，不要只用模糊的词语进行简述。向其他人明确你具体做了什么来保护你的用户，同时也要明确你认为哪些事物已超出你的考量范围，并要经常进行这样的沟通。“安全” 是个好特点，但它的涵盖面过广，所以请勿畏于夸赞自己在某个具体方向上的特别之处。\n\r\n（题图：MJ/b8cc54ee-5556-4106-b9fa-b08539452aa7）\n\r\n\r\nvia: https://opensource.com/article/22/9/security-buzzword-alternatives\n\r\n作者：Seth Kenlon 选题：lkxed 译者：ChatGPT 校对：wxy\n\r\n本文由 LCTT 原创编译，Linux中国 荣誉推出",

          "description": "Focusrite 正在大力支持 Linux 。\n\r\n\r\n尽管 Linux 作为桌面平台正在快速发展，但与 Windows 和 macOS 相比，它仍然是少数音乐制作人的选择。一个主要原因是缺乏一些 DAW 和硬件制造商的官方支持。\n\r\n幸运的是，随着大牌企业涉足 Linux，这一切都在改变。好奇么？ 嗯，最近，PreSonus 宣布其 Studio One DAW 支持 Linux。\n\r\n现在，PreSonus 的直接竞争对手之一 Focusrite 也加入了进来🤩，他们也生产音频接口和其他专业音频设备。\n\r\n如果你是音乐制作人或音乐爱好者，你应该知道这些名字往往是彼此的代名词。虽然我目前使用 PreSonus 而不是 Focusrite，但这两家公司及其产品对于大众市场来说都很重要。\n\r\nFocusrite 对 Linux 支持的承诺\n\r\nGeoffrey Bennett 是 LinuxMusicians 论坛的用户，他因致力于为流行的 Focusrite 音频接口（Scarlett 第二代和第三代）提供 Linux 支持而闻名。\n\r\n当然，这是一项艰巨的非官方任务。\n\r\n为了更进一步，他最近发起了一项筹款活动，以获得 Focusrite 的最新音频接口，即 Scarlett 第四代。\n\r\n除此之外，他的目标是购买 Focusrite 的播客设备。\n\r\n\n\r\n筹款活动取得成功的同时，也得到了 Focusrite 的关注，他们提供了大量资金来帮助他购买最新的音频接口。\n\r\nFocusrite 还表示愿意在产品发布前，向他寄送他没有的设备以及未来的产品。\n\r\n最重要的是，他们提到了他们的工程团队如何帮助他改进开发工作。\n\r\n\r\n虽然我之前一直很难与 Focusrite 的工程师或管理层取得联系，但这次筹款活动获得热烈反响的消息传到了 Focusrite 的高层。考虑到 Linux 音频的小众性质，我一直控制着自己的期望值，但这超出了我的想象。\n\r\n我刚刚与他们通了电话，除了提供硬件之外，他们还询问支持开发的其他方式。\n\r\nFocusrite 不仅主动提出给我寄来我收藏中没有的设备，而且还提议，对于未来的产品发布，他们将尽最大努力提前向我发送设备。这意味着 Linux 支持可以从产品发布之日起就做好准备！\n\r\n此外，他们正在讨论他们的工程团队如何更好地帮助我简化开发流程，并消除大部分猜测。\n\r\n—— Geoffrey 来自 LinuxMusicians\n\r\n\r\n因此，Focusrite 希望确保 Linux 社区能够以更好的体验使用他们的产品。也就是说，间接为 Linux 平台提供官方支持。\n\r\n这是个大新闻！\n\r\n这两家大型音频制造商也应该会说服其他软件和硬件公司。无论是对驱动程序的官方支持，还是对客户的故障排除支持，任何方式都是可行的。\n\r\n对 Linux 平台的任何关注都将有助于改善 Linux 音频生态系统。\n\r\n如果更多的音频公司添加了 Linux 支持，音频专业人士就不必被锁定在专有平台上，也不必支付许可证费用来获得操作系统。\n\r\n💬我对未来充满希望！你怎么看呢？\n\r\n\r\nvia: https://news.itsfoss.com/focusrite-linux/\n\r\n作者：Ankush Das 选题：lujun9972 译者：geekpi 校对：wxy\n\r\n本文由 LCTT 原创编译，Linux中国 荣誉推出",

          "description": "连谷歌 CEO 都不了解谷歌的隐私控制措施\n\r\n在一件针对谷歌的集体诉讼案中，一位专家证人作证说，就连谷歌 CEO 桑达尔·皮查伊Sundar Pichai 也错误地向国会描述了“网络与应用活动” 隐私复选框的工作原理。该复选框声称可以阻止谷歌将用户的 “活动” 保存到谷歌的服务器上，但诉讼称事实并非如此。这个开关的真正作用：如果你关闭了它，谷歌将停止应用它捕获的数据来 “个性化” 一些非常特殊的面向用户的界面，如 Chrome 浏览器、搜索和安卓系统。该证人说，这个隐私开关，“当你打开它时，它只是意味着我们不会告诉你我们在监视你”。\n\r\n\r\n消息来源：Ars Technica\n\r\n\r\n\r\n老王点评：毕竟，谷歌是依靠对用户信息的掌握来卖广告的。\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n谷歌悄悄计划阻止苹果发展其搜索产品\n\r\n谷歌与苹果公司的关系错综复杂，既是竞争对手，也是合作伙伴。谷歌除了向苹果支付大量金钱，以保持谷歌搜索引擎在 iPhone 手机上的默认选择权之外，谷歌还悄悄计划遏制苹果的搜索野心。据谷歌内部文件显示，在苹果的 Spotlight 开始向用户显示更丰富的网络搜索结果后，谷歌想方设法通过为 iPhone 提供自己的版本来削弱 Spotlight，并说服更多的 iPhone 用户使用谷歌的 Chrome 浏览器，而不是苹果的 Safari 浏览器。与此同时，谷歌还在研究如何利用旨在帮助小公司与大科技公司竞争的欧洲新法律，撬开苹果对 iPhone 的控制。\n\r\n\r\n消息来源：《纽约时报》\n\r\n\r\n\r\n老王点评：看来苹果不会有机会发展自己的搜索产品了。\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\nDeepMind 负责人表示人工智能应该像气候和原子能一样监管\n\r\n谷歌 DeepMind 负责人 德米斯·哈萨比斯Demis Hassabis 表示，“必须像对待气候变化等其他重大全球挑战一样，认真对待人工智能的风险。……我们不能再有同样的延误了。”他说，对该行业的监督可以从类似于政府间气候变化专门委员会（IPCC）的机构开始，然后“也许有一天会出现某种与国际原子能机构相当的机构，对这些事情进行实际审核。”虽然他认为世界距离开发出 “神一样” 的人工智能还有很长的路要走，目前的人工智能系统 “没有风险，但下几代可能会有风险”， “所以我们现在就应该讨论它”。\n\r\n\r\n消息来源：《卫报》\n\r\n\r\n\r\n老王点评：只是，这种国际间的协调机构怎么才能不会成为领先者保持优势的工具？",

          "description": "你是否使用 Flatpak 应用？Warehouse 可以让你更轻松。\n\r\n\r\n有一个应用，可以为你提供有关 Flatpak 应用的所有重要信息，以及管理它的工具，这不是很好吗？\n\r\n这一次你很幸运！\n\r\n在这次的首次尝试中，我们有一个有趣的应用程序，名为 “Warehouse”，它可以帮助你管理 Flatpak 应用。\n\r\n我们以前介绍过一个类似的应用，名为 “Flatseal”，但它更侧重于管理 Flatpak 的权限。\n\r\n让我们看看 Warehouse 提供了哪些功能。\n\r\nWarehouse：概述 ⭐\n\r\n\n\r\n开发人员将其称为“多功能工具箱”，Warehouse 可用于管理 Flatpak 用户数据、查看 Flatpak 的信息，甚至批量管理系统上安装的 Flatpaks。\n\r\n它主要使用 Python 语言编写，具有以下主要特点：\n\r\n\r\n轻松管理用户数据\n\r\n批量操作功能\n\r\n清除残余数据\n\r\n\r\n初步印象 👨‍💻\n\r\n我一开始是在我的 Ubuntu 系统上测试 Warehouse。从 Flathub 上安装它很简单。\n\r\n打开后，显示了所有已安装的 Flatpak 应用的列表。它们都以有序的方式排列。\n\r\n在我看来，如果它们添加了切换到网格布局的选项，会看起来更好。\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n📋 你是否对列在 Firefox 之上的应用感到好奇？我们最近介绍过它，它是一个名为 “Mission Center” 的系统监控应用。\n\r\n\r\n接下来，我查看了 Flatpak 应用的属性，我点击应用旁边的“信息”标志，打开了应用属性窗口。\n\r\n它提供了有关应用程序的各种信息，从名称、描述、应用 ID，一直到活动提交和安装大小。\n\r\n\n\r\n类似地，我可以点击“垃圾桶”图标，要么完全卸载 Flatpak 应用，要么为将来重新安装保留用户数据，并恢复设置/内容。\n\r\n\n\r\nWarehouse 还具有搜索功能，允许你搜索特定的应用。当你安装了很多 Flatpak 应用时，这可能会很有用。\n\r\n只需点击应用程序左上角的放大镜图标即可开始搜索。\n\r\n\n\r\n你还可以设置过滤器，以应用甚至运行时（系统完成各种任务所需的）进行排序。\n\r\n点击应用程序左上角的“漏斗”图标以开始筛选。\n\r\n\n\r\n然后，我查看了批量操作功能。我首先点击了应用右上方的“勾号”标志。\n\r\n然后，我就可以选择多个应用，执行复制信息、删除应用数据和卸载它们等操作。\n\r\n应用程序右下角的三个小按钮可以方便地执行上述操作。\n\r\n\n\r\n之后，我进入菜单，其中有一些重要选项。\n\r\n\n\r\n第一个选项“从文件安装Install from file”允许我使用 .flatpakref 文件安装 Flatpak 应用。\n\r\n\n\r\n在安装过程中，它问我是要为特定用户安装，还是要为使用系统的所有人安装。我选择了后者。\n\r\n\n\r\n随后，我查看了“管理残余数据Manage Leftover Data”选项。它向我显示了一个旧的 Flatpak 应用留下了多少数据。\n\r\n我可以选择通过“安装Install”选项重新安装应用并恢复数据，也可以使用“垃圾桶Trash”选项彻底清除系统中的任何痕迹。有时，残留数据会占用大量空间。\n\r\n\n\r\n如果你经常安装/删除应用，那么你的系统中可能会有很多剩余数据。\n\r\n如果你想管理 Flatpak 仓库，可以前往“管理远程仓库Manage Remotes”选项，该选项允许你添加或删除它们。\n\r\n\n\r\n虽然你可以在 Fedora 和其他一些发行版的软件中心完成这项工作，但在一个应用中就能获得所有基本功能，这将是一种无缝体验。\n\r\n最后，你还可以使用大量的“键盘快捷键”，通过键盘快速浏览应用的所有功能。\n\r\n\n\r\n📥 下载 Warehouse\n\r\n你可以前往 Flathub 商店下载最新版本。\n\r\n\r\nWarehouse（Flathub）\n\r\n\r\n你还可以访问其 GitHub 仓库 查看源代码。\n\r\n你对 Warehouse 应用有何看法？请在下面的评论中分享你的想法。\n\r\n\r\nvia: https://news.itsfoss.com/warehouse/\n\r\n作者：Sourav Rudra 选题：lujun9972 译者：geekpi 校对：wxy\n\r\n本文由 LCTT 原创编译，Linux中国 荣誉推出",

          "description": "1983 年，大卫·科波菲尔令人惊讶的使自由女神像消失的同时，Word for DOS 诞生了。\n\r\n\r\n今天，Word 已经有 40 年历史了。撇开庆祝不谈，值得一提的是，时至 2023 年，这款生产力应用，并不一直是如今在许多工作站上看到的那个臃肿的样子。\n\r\n首个版本的 Word （最初称为 “Multi-Tool Word”）于 1983 年 10 月 25 日在 Xenix 和 MS-DOS 平台上发布。这款产品支持 16 位图形和文本模式，同时也兼容当时刚出现的 “点击设备”——鼠标。\n\r\n编写这个版本的团队包括 查尔斯·西蒙尼Charles Simonyi 等人，他们过去曾在 施乐帕克Xerox PARC 工作，后来在微软的应用部门获得了成功。可以公正的说，Word 的成功非一日之功。\n\r\n当时，它面对 WordStar 等老牌产品的激烈竞争，当 Word 发布时，WordStar 已占据了约四分之一的文字处理市场。而在 DOS 上首度亮相的 WordPerfect，也是潜在的威胁。\n\r\nWord 的首个版本并非完全的所见即所得应用，但微软坚持不懈，在接下来的数年里逐步增加其特性，直至 1993 年的最后一个 DOS 版本 —— Word 6.0 for DOS。然而，与此同时，一个新的竞争者即将全面掌控这个市场，那就是 Word for Windows。\n\r\nWord for Windows 从默默无闻，到不到 10 年就占据了文字处理市场 90% 的份额。\n\r\n第一版 Windows 版本的 Word 在 1989 年发布，但直到 1990 年 Windows 3.0 的发布，这款软件才奠定了它今天的巨大商业成功。Word for Windows 2.0 在 1991 年面世，对于笔者来讲，这是 Word for Windows 开始膨胀前的黄金时期，直到 Word 6.0 for Windows 的推出，软件的臃肿问题才开始一发不可收拾。\n\r\n现阶段，它的名称变为 Office 365 的 Word，毫无疑问，微软的精英团队正竭尽全力想办法如何在其中融入 “AI” 这个词汇。\n\r\n然而，我们回顾 1983 年，Word 在竞争对手主导的文字处理器市场中不过是众多选择之一。正如 Word 曾试图挑战竞争对手的主导地位，近年来，它的市场份额也在慢慢被如谷歌文档等竞争者侵蚀。\n\r\n1984 年首次发布的 Word 1.1a 的源代码可以在 计算机历史博物馆 找到。这个 ZIP 文件仅有不到 7MB，你可以想象一下。\n\r\n（题图：MJ/30bb1962-25de-4751-b828-566c4657d8c3）\n\r\n\r\nvia: https://www.theregister.com/2023/10/25/microsoft_word_40/ \n\r\n作者：Richard Speed 译者：ChatGPT 校对：wxy\n\r\n本文由 LCTT 原创编译，Linux中国 荣誉推出",

          "description": "Windows CE 彻底落幕\n\r\n诞生于 1996 年的 Windows 嵌入式操作系统 Windows CE 最初是 Windows 的精简版本，之后逐渐发展成为全新的操作系统，有着自己的 CE 内核，而不是传统 Windows 操作系统使用的 NT 内核，它的最后一个版本是发布于 2013 年的 Windows CE 8.0。该版本于 2018 年 10 月结束主流支持，并在本月结束延长支持，成为不受支持的退役产品。然而，很少有人注意到这两件事的发生。就像之前的 Windows CE 7.0 一样。在 CE 8 平台上发布的设备寥寥无几，大多数人甚至从未见过 CE 8 的实体设备。CE 8 唯一值得注意的特点是首次加入了 IPv6 支持。但更重要的是删除了默认示例用户界面，它规定任何 OEM 都必须发布带有完全自定义编码界面的设备，事实上真正结束了廉价 Windows CE 上网本设备的时代。\n\r\n\r\n消息来源：H/PC Factor\n\r\n\r\n\r\n老王点评：很多人都不记得 Windows CE 了吧，就这样悄悄落幕了。要是微软能开源出来就好了。\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\nCanonical 将坚持 10 年的 Ubuntu LTS 支持周期\n\r\n之前，我们报道过，Linux 内核社区正在考虑将其 LTS 内核的支持周期从 6 年缩短为 2 年。在此情况下，Canonical 重申他们对 Ubuntu LTS 版本的支持周期为 10 年，不会因为上游内核 LTS 政策的转变而缩短支持窗口，就像红帽的 RHEL 等企业版 Linux 一样。Ubuntu LTS 内核并不总是与 Linux LTS 内核保持一致，而且 Ubuntu LTS 的点版本通常会反向移植较新的内核版本，作为其硬件使能（HWE）堆栈的一部分。\n\r\n\r\n消息来源：Phoronix\n\r\n\r\n\r\n老王点评：企业版 Linux 理所应当得到十年或更久的支持，从这一点上看，Linux 基金会相当于将球踢给了各个企业 Linux 发行商。\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\nLinux RISC-V 准备支持实时内核\n\r\n随着 2023 年临近结束，令人遗憾的是，实时内核 “PREEMPT_RT” 支持仍未实现主流化。主要的障碍仍然是正在进行的非阻塞控制台/线程控制台处理工作，以便合并剩余的几十个树外实时内核补丁。好消息是当 PREEMPT_RT 支持在主线上准备就绪时，RISC-V 架构似乎也将支持实时内核。目前，Linux RT 补丁集允许 ARM64、ARM、PowerPC 和 x86/x86_64 架构启用实时内核支持，而最近正在开发的一组补丁也将支持 RISC-V。\n\r\n\r\n消息来源：Phoronix\n\r\n\r\n\r\n老王点评：虽然实时内核还一直没就绪，但是如果 RISC-V 能第一时间支持实时内核，这对 RISC-V 来说是个很好的消息。",

          "description": "通过这个全新的应用可以实现所有蓝牙功能！\n\r\n\r\n一款适用于 Linux 的新应用已经出现，它可能是满足你所有蓝牙需求的一站式应用。\n\r\n这款名为 “Overskride” 的开源应用首次发布。尽管它还处于开发阶段，但已经提供了一些不错的功能。\n\r\n请允许我带你看一下。\n\r\nOverskride：可以期待什么？\n\r\n\n\r\nOverskride 将会吸引 Rust 爱好者，因为它主要是用 Rust 语言编写的，带有 GTK4/libadwaita 风格。\n\r\n根据开发人员的说法，它是一个简单的蓝牙和 Obex 客户端 （未来计划），无论使用什么桌面环境或窗口管理器都可以工作。\n\r\n一些主要功能包括：\n\r\n\r\n信任/阻止设备。\n\r\n能够发送/接收文件。\n\r\n设置连接超时时间。\n\r\n支持配置适配器。\n\r\n\r\n查看上面的截图，你可以看到自定义蓝牙设备和连接的所有基本选项，包括适配器名称。\n\r\n当然，考虑到这是该应用的第一次发布，人们不应该抱有太高的期望。因此，还有改进的空间。\n\r\n以下是 Overskride 的一些预览，以查看它提供的功能。\n\r\n我在 Ubuntu 22.04 LTS 和 GNOME 42.9 上使用提供的 Flatpak 包进行安装。在此安装上运行似乎没有任何问题。\n\r\nOverskride 能够检测到我的智能手机，并提供多种配置选项。\n\r\n\n\r\n你可以将设备添加到受信任列表或阻止列表、重命名并发送文件。\n\r\n我尝试了文件传输功能，但在此之前，我必须使用 Flatseal 允许访问用户文件，以便它可以读取我系统上的文件。\n\r\n\n\r\n我在手机上接受文件传输后，传输开始。速度还可以，文件确实完整地到达那里，没有任何问题。\n\r\n\n\r\n我必须说，在其首次发布时，开发人员为我们提供了一个有用的实用程序。我很高兴看到其未来版本将提供什么样的改进。\n\r\n一位 Reddit 用户 询问 是否有任何计划支持显示无线耳机的电池百分比。对此，开发人员提到这样做很棘手，因为 每个设备都遵循不同的规范，这使得这一目标更难实现。\n\r\n📥 获得 Overskride\n\r\n目前，Overskride 只能通过 GitHub 仓库 以 Flatpak 软件包的形式提供。或者，你也可以从源代码开始编译。\n\r\n\r\nOverskride (GitHub)\n\r\n\r\n我希望开发者在发布稳定版本后将其发布在 Flathub 上，以便用户可以使用。\n\r\n\r\nvia: https://news.itsfoss.com/bluetooth-app-linux-overskride/\n\r\n作者：Sourav Rudra 选题：lujun9972 译者：geekpi 校对：wxy\n\r\n本文由 LCTT 原创编译，Linux中国 荣誉推出",

          "description": "艺术家使用图像投毒工具反击生成式人工智能\n\r\n一种名为 “Nightshade” 的新工具可以让艺术家们在将作品上传到网络之前，对作品中的像素点进行不可见的修改，这样一来，如果作品被抓取到人工智能训练集中，就会导致生成的模型以混乱和不可预测的方式崩溃，使它们的一些输出结果变得毫无用处，比如狗变成猫，汽车变成牛等等。开发此工具的团队还开发了一个名为 “Glaze” 的工具，允许艺术家 “屏蔽” 自己的个人风格，过微妙的方式改变图像的像素，这种改变人眼看不见，但却能操纵机器学习模型，将图像解释为与实际显示不同的东西。\n\r\n\r\n消息来源：Technology Review\n\r\n\r\n\r\n老王点评：我欣赏这样的举动，但是我认为这样的工具并不能根除问题，就像那些用来判断是否是 AI 生成的文字的工具一样，终究会被 AI 打败。\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n科学家们可以放心使用 Excel 了\n\r\n2020 年，科学家们决定重新设计他们用来表示基因的字母数字符号，以避免在输入到 Excel 中时自动转换。Excel 的自动转换功能旨在让某些类型的常用输入数据（例如数字和日期）的输入变得更简单、更快捷。但对于使用快速速记来使事物清晰易读的科学家来说，这可能会毁掉已发表的、经过同行评审的数据，比如将基因名称解释为日期，并（毫无）帮助地自动重新排版。上周，Excel 团队发布消息称，他们修复了这一问题，添加了一个启用默认自动转换功能的复选框。\n\r\n\r\n消息来源：The Verge\n\r\n\r\n\r\n老王点评：不知道有没有做科研的同学被微软 Excel 的自动转换坑过。\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n英伟达和 AMD 计划推出基于 Arm 的 PC 芯片\n\r\nPC 行业正面临来自苹果公司愈来愈大的竞争压力。自苹果 Mac 电脑采用基于 Arm 的芯片以来，它的市场份额三年内几乎翻了一番。苹果的成功吸引了微软的注意，微软希望 Windows 平台也有类似的高性能芯片。分析家称，“微软从上世纪 90 年代学到，不能再依赖单一供应商。如果 Arm 真的在 PC 领域起飞，他们绝不会让高通成为唯一的供应商。”高通早在 2016 年就开始为笔记本电脑提供 Arm 芯片。英伟达和 AMD 预计最早将在 2025 年销售运行 Windows 的 Arm 芯片。\n\r\n\r\n消息来源：路透社\n\r\n\r\n\r\n老王点评：看来 Arm 能在 PC 市场获得一席之地。不过我还是更看好 RISC-V 的未来。",

          "description": "他还称，Linux 基金会接受 OpenTofu 的决策是一个 “悲剧”。\n\r\n\r\n（本文节略自 The Stack 的文章）\n\r\nHashiCorp 的 CEO 在该公司本月的用户会议上为其改变许可证的做法辩护。他预测，除非社区重新思考如何保护创新，否则硅谷将 “不再有开源公司”。\n\r\n作为 IaaC 的先驱者，他在 HashiConf 用户会议上介绍了一系列产品了更新和新特性，这是在该公司将其所有产品的版权协议从 Mozilla 公共许可证Mozilla Public License（MPL）更改为 商业源代码许可证Business Source License（BSL）后不到两个月时间所做的举措。\n\r\nHashiCorp 当时表明，“除了在与 HashiCorp 商业产品竞争的产品中托管或嵌入软件外，所有生产用途都不受限制，无论是自我管理的还是托管的。”\n\r\n然而，此举引起了开源社区的强烈反响。在 Linux 基金会的支持下，一个名为 OpenTofu 的 Terraform 分支很快地被发布出来。\n\r\nHashiCorp 的 CEO Dave McJannet 本周表示，改变许可证的决策是必要的，因为 HashiCorp 的技术对现代云服务起到了关键的作用，随着全球最大的公司将其业务从本地技术转移到云服务，这种关键性只会越来越强。\n\r\n尽管开源社区猛烈批评了 HashiCorp 改变许可证的决定，但 McJannet 说其最大的客户对此的反应却是，“太好了，因为你是我们的关键伙伴，我们需要你发展成一个大公司。”实际上，他表示，在很多反馈中客户表示，“我们希望你早点这么做”，并补充说，这个决定在公告之前就已经与主要的云供应商进行了讨论。\n\r\nMcJannet 说，“过去三四年间，每个达到一定规模的供应商都已经得出了同样的结论。……这只是意识到，鉴于市场现在的激励机制，开源模型必须演进。”\n\r\n他声称，过去成立开源基金会的模式现在已经不合时宜了，这些基金会都被传统供应商所主导。以 Hadoop 为例，他说，“基金会就是大公司免遭创新影响的一种机制，如果 Hadoop 流行起来，IBM 这样的公司可以把它拿来，因为他们是基金会的一部分，他们可以以更低的价钱卖出去。”\n\r\n将开源产品放到 GitHub 上 “的确非常好”，但是，一旦某个项目变得流行，“克隆供应商就开始竞相复制”。\n\r\n他声称，“我们发出公告后不久，我就开始接到来自硅谷每一个开源创业公司的电话，他们都告诉我，‘我认为这才是正确的模型’。”\n\r\n“确实是悲剧……”，他感叹道，Linux 基金会接受 OpenTofu 的行动，为我们揭示了一个严重的问题。“如果基金会只是简单地接收并给它找个归宿，那对开源的未来将带来怎样的影响呢？这对开源创新而言，无疑是一场悲剧。我可以坦诚告诉你，如果这样的事情真的发生，硅谷将再也看不到开源公司的身影。”\n\r\n他更具体地指出，许可证的改变是他们为赢取企业信任而设计的策略的一部分。\n\r\n“让其他供应商误解我们的产品是一个巨大的风险，对吗？这对我们的长期发展是不利的，对我们的客户而言也同样危险。”\n\r\n他进一步解释说，赢得这些大型组织的信任是促使 HashiCorp 当时选择上市的一个驱动力。“我们并不全然需要钱，我们之所以这么做，是想要向公众表明，我们有充足的资金，可以成为他们长期信任的合作伙伴。”\n\r\n他补充说，他们提议继续和受许可证更改影响的四个主要的公司合作，“只需要你们承担一部分研发成本。然而他们却拒绝，声称要另起炉灶，这对我们来说也没问题。”\n\r\n（题图：MJ/5cdb5ba0-a7fa-4a29-b3dd-ef0d07bad575）\n\r\n\r\nvia: https://www.thestack.technology/hashicorp-ceo-predicts-oss-free-silicon-valley-unless-the-open-source-model-evolves/ \n\r\n作者：JOE FAY 译者：ChatGPT 校对：wxy\n\r\n本文由 LCTT 原创编译，Linux中国 荣誉推出",

          "description": "观察你的代码在其他解释器下运行的表现或许是一项有趣的尝试。\n\r\n\r\n作为最受欢迎的编程语言之一，Python 需要一个解释器来执行其代码所定义的命令。与其他可直接编译成机器代码的语言不同，Python 代码需要解释器读取它并把它转译给进行相关操作的 CPU。那么，哪些解释器有哪些呢？本文将对其中几种进行介绍。\n\r\n解释器简介\n\r\n提到 Python 解释器，我们通常会想到 /usr/bin/python 这个二进制文件。它使你能够执行 .py 文件。然而，解释操作仅仅是其中一环。在 Python 代码真正被 CPU 执行之前，都需要经过以下四个步骤：\n\r\n\r\n词法分析 - 将人类编写的源代码转换为一序列逻辑实体，被称为 词法标记lexical token。\n\r\n解析 - 解析器会检查词法标记的语法和语义规则生成 抽象语法树abstract syntax tree（AST）。\n\r\n编译 - 编译器会根据 AST 创建 Python 字节码，这些字节码由非常基础的，和平台无关的指令组成。\n\r\n解释 - 解释器处理字节码并执行特定的操作。\n\r\n\r\n如你所见，在任何实质性的操作发生之前，我们需要走过这些步骤。这也解释了深入研究不同解释器的重要性。\n\r\n1、CPython\n\r\n作为 Python 的参考实现，CPython 默认地被许多系统所采用。如其名称所示，CPython 是用 C 语言编写的。这也意味着，我们可以 以 C 语言编写扩展，从而让 Python 打通到广泛使用的 C 语言库代码。CPython 广泛应用于各种平台，包括 ARM 和 RISC。然而，作为 Python 的参考实现，CPython 更注重精细的优化，而非运行速度。\n\r\n2、Pyston\n\r\nPyston 是一个从 CPython 解释器衍生出的分支，其中实现了性能优化。该项目定位自己为标准 CPytho…",

          "description": "当地时间11月4日，谷歌DeepMind联合创始人谢恩·莱格（Shane Legg）带领的DeepMind研究团队发布论文（Levels of AGI: Operationalizing Progress on the Path to AGI），提出了对通用人工智能（AGI）的更清晰定义，制定了类似于自动驾驶L1-L5级别的AGI分级分类框架。\n\r\n\r\n长期以来，AGI都是一个含义模糊的概念，粗略可以将其理解为“和人类差不多聪明”。研究团队在论文中写道，“我们希望提供一个共通的语言，用于比较模型、评估风险，以及衡量我们在通往AGI的道路上行进到了什么阶段。”\n\r\n\r\nAGI六大定义原则\n\r\n\r\n研究团队没有用一句话概括AGI，而是提出，任何对AGI的定义都应满足六条原则：\n\r\n\r\n关注能力，而非过程。也就是说关注AGI可以完成什么，而不是完成任务的机制。这种将关注焦点放在能力上的方式，使我们能够将一些内容排除在对AGI的要求之外，比如实现AGI并不意味着智能体以类似人类的方式思考或理解，或实现AGI并不意味着智能体具备意识或感知（具有情感的能力），因为这些特质不仅侧重于过程，而且目前无法通过公认的科学方法来衡量。\n\r\n\r\n关注通用性和性能。研究团队认为，通用性和性能是AGI的关键组成部分。\n\r\n\r\n关注认知和元认知任务。大多数对AGI的定义侧重于认知任务，可以理解为非物理任务。尽管目前机器人技术取得了一些进展，但与非物理能力相比，AI系统的物理能力似乎滞后了。执行物理任务的能力确实增加了智能体的通用性，但我们认为这不应被视为实现AGI必要的先决条件。另一方面，元认知能力（例如学习新任务的能力或知道何时向人类请求澄清或协助的能力）是智能体实现通用性的关键先决条件。\n\r\n\r\n关注潜力，而非部署。证明系统能够以一定性能水平执行一组必要任务，应该足以宣布该系统为AGI，在现实世界部署这样的系统，不应该成为AGI定义的固有要求。\n\r\n\r\n关注生态效度（Ecological Validity）。我们希望强调，选择与人们在现实世界（即生态有效）所重视的任务相一致的任务非常重要。\n\r\n\r\n关注通往AGI的路径，而不是单一的终点。研究团队提出AGI的五级分类，每个AGI级别都与一组明确的度量/基准相关联，以及每个级别都引入已识别的风险和人机交互范式的变化，比如OpenAI提出的劳动替代定义就更符合“大师AGI”。\n\r\n\r\nAGI五级分类\n\r\n\r\n基于能力深度（性能）和广度（通用性）将AGI分类为：非AI、初级、中级、专家、大师、超级智能。\n\r\n\r\n基于能力深度（性能）和广度（通用性），该研究将AGI分类为：非AI、初级、中级、专家、大师、超级智能。单个系统可能横跨分类法中的不同级别，截至2023年9月，前沿语言模型如OpenAI的ChatGPT、谷歌的Bard、Meta的Llama 2在某些任务上（如短篇论文写作、简单编码）表现出能力娴熟的“中级”性能水平，但在大多数任务上（如数学能力、涉及事实性的任务）仍处于“初级”性能水平。\n\r\n\r\n研究团队认为，总的来说，当前的前沿语言模型会被视为第1级通用AI，即“初级AGI”，直到其性能水平在更广泛的任务集上提高，满足第2级通用AI（“能力娴熟AGI”）的标准。\n\r\n\r\n同时，研究团队提醒道，获得特定认知领域的更强技能，可能对AI安全产生严重影响，如在掌握强大的伦理推理技能之前获得强大的化学工程知识可能是一种危险的组合。还要注意，性能或通用性级别之间的进展速度可能是非线性的。获得学习新技能的能力可能会加速通往下一个级别的进程。\n\r\n\r\n在性能和通用性的综合方面，分级中的最高级别是ASI（人工超级智能）。研究团队将“超级智能”性能定义为超过100%的人类。例如，研究团队假定AlphaFold是分类法中的第5级“限定领域超人AI”，因为它在一个任务（从氨基酸序列预测蛋白质的三维结构）上的表现高于全球顶级科学家的水平。这个定义意味着第5级通用AI（ASI）系统将能够以没有人类能够匹敌的水平执行各种任务。\n\r\n\r\n此外，这个框架还意味着这样的“超人系统”可能能够执行比AGI低级别更广泛的任务，可以理解为其能够实现原本人类完全不可能执行的任务。ASI可能具有的非人类技能可能包括神经界面（通过分析大脑信号来解码思想的机制）、神谕能力（通过分析大量数据来做出高质量预测的机制），以及与动物交流的能力（通过分析它们的声音、脑电波或肢体语言的模式等机制）。\n\r\n\r\n10月底，莱格在接受科技播客采访时表示，他仍然坚持2011年就曾公开发表的观点——研究人员有50%的可能在2028年实现AGI。那么这具体指的是哪一个级别？目前他还没有明确的阐释。\n\r\n\r\n来源：澎湃新闻",

          "description": "10月31日晚，上海万圣节又冲上热搜。在上海迪士尼、巨鹿路等地，有人扮成安陵容、甄嬛、祺贵人等《甄嬛传》中的角色形象；有人模仿明星、名人，扮成那英、向太、关晓彤、李佳琦、蔡徐坤等明星造型，有人模仿鲁迅、程蝶衣等经典影视形象，相关话题引全网热议。\n\r\n\r\n万圣节做为一个洋节，原本我预期依旧会遭到以往那样的打击，然而，今年的宣传口突然不再打击过洋节了，是个好现象，至少商家们能喘口气，可以借着节日，搞些花样促销活动带旺消费。\n\r\n\r\n针对上海万圣节的cosplay造型模仿明星，胡锡进发表评论表示，舆论在围观它的同时，无需给这个符号施加压力，试图约束它。上海的小青年们骨子里都是中国传统和当代文化的拥趸，所以他们玩着玩着万圣节这个洋节，就朝着中国人熟悉的方向改造起它来。\n\r\n\r\n以下为胡锡进的原文：\n\r\n\r\n\r\n今年上海的小青年们万圣节玩出了“中国化”的花样，对各种现实社会的人物和文化符号所做的模仿更加吸睛，风头大大压过了传统的“死神”扮相，在互联网上引起持续关注。当然，反对的声音也有。\n\r\n上海的小青年之所以喜欢万圣节，我认为主要还是因为它好玩，热闹，而且是一个大家聚会、往一起凑的机会。中国的传统节日有自己的特长，更多鼓励亲人聚会，在城市里尤其是这样。舞狮子、踩高跷、划旱船等集体活动在乡镇和农村比较流行，大城市里难得一见。端午划龙舟需要特殊场地，专业性强，而且在北方不流行。我认为，万圣节受现代小青年们喜欢，这个现象值得思考和关注。\n\r\n\r\n我是觉得，怎么看上海万圣节今年“中国化”的现象，这可以讨论。但是年轻人需要多有一些标志性凑热闹、别出心裁出风头、无拘无束释放情绪的机会，它是现代都市里趋势性的需求之一，对它的最好做法不是堵，而是疏。\n\r\n\r\n我们的社会总体上偏严肃，纪律性强，这有我们的内在逻辑和优势。然而什么事情都是辩证的，宽松与释放同样是社会和谐的内在要素之一，对实现平衡不可或缺。上海万圣节比较活跃，已经成为这个现代都市的一个包容符号，我认为舆论在围观它的同时，无需给这个符号施加压力，试图约束它。\n\r\n\r\n不能不说，上海的小青年们还是挺有创造性的，而且他们骨子里都是中国传统和当代文化的拥趸，所以他们玩着玩着万圣节这个洋节，就朝着中国人熟悉的方向改造起它来，而且这样一改造，引起的关注比往年大了不知多少倍。\n\r\n\r\n我们的社会确实需要多有一些包容，包括承受力。如果什么都规规矩矩，生活会变得乏味，那会削弱年轻人的信心。其实生活中的很多事没那么复杂，不要人为搞复杂了。在不涉政治的领域多给大家，尤其是多给年轻人一些无拘无束的空间，不会出什么问题，其结果绝大多数情况下会是我们集体情绪变得更加乐观、自信。社会和谐是一个生态，它注定是包罗万象的。",

          "description": "近日，华为技术有限公司申请注册“遥遥领先”商标，国际分类为运输工具、科学仪器，当前商标状态为等待实质审查。近期，因华为 Mate60 系列手机发售，“遥遥领先”成为网络热词。\n\r\n\r\n据企查查显示，近日，华为技术有限公司申请注册“遥遥领先”商标，国际分类为运输工具、科学仪器，当前商标状态为等待实质审查。\n\r\n\r\n据悉，“遥遥领先”是华为常务董事、终端BG CEO、智能汽车解决方案BU CEO余承东最早在2020年底的华为Mate 40系列发布会上多次提及的形容词。据统计，他在整场发布会中共说了14次“遥遥领先”，之后这个词就火了起来，成为一个网络热词。\n\r\n\r\n去年的Mate50发布，全球首发了卫星通信功能，余承东再次提及“遥遥领先”，将“遥遥领先”的热度推高。\n\r\n\r\n今年9月12日下午，余承东现身上海前滩31号，主持当天的问界新M7发布会。虽然此前已有消息称，此次发布不包括手机等新品信息，但与发布会相关的各种词条却在当天接连登上社交平台的热搜榜。\n\r\n\r\n据统计，在90分钟的发布环节，余承东在现场至少提及了五次“遥遥领先”，二十多次“领先”，每次提到的时候均引发了现场观众的掌声。\n\r\n\r\n自9月华为Mate 60系列开启“先锋计划”以来，华为Mate 60系列手机目前仍然“一机难求”，此外，据CINNO数据报告显示，在超高端折叠屏市场，华为占据了50%的市场份额；车业务方面，问界新M7正式上市后，销量持续走高，日均订单量超1500台，上市不到两周，订单已超2万台，根据最新数据显示，问界新M7累计大定已突破6万台。\n\r\n\r\n近日，华为发布2023年前三季度经营业绩，实现销售收入4566亿元人民币，同比增长2.4%，净利润率16.0%。\n\r\n\r\n华为轮值董事长胡厚崑表示：“公司经营结果符合预期。感谢客户、伙伴一直以来对华为的信任和支持。面向未来，我们将持续加大研发投入，发挥公司产业组合优势，不断提升产品和服务竞争力，为客户、伙伴和社会创造更大价值。”\n\r\n\r\n值得指出的是，与去年同期和今年上半年相比，华为的利润率都有所提升。2022年，华为前三季度公司实现销售收入4458亿元人民币，主营业务利润率为6.1%；今年8月，华为公布上半年财报实现营收3082.9亿元，净利润率为15%。\n\r\n\r\n今年上半年，华为多项业务表现稳中有进：ICT基础设施业务保持稳健，终端收入实现增长，数字能源和云业务实现良好增长，智能汽车增量部件竞争力持续提升。\n\r\n\r\n来源：综合每日经济新闻、企查查、每经App、华为发布会\n\r\n\r\n注释：\n\r\n\r\n《商标法》第十条规定：带有欺骗性，容易使公众对商品的质量等特点或者产地产生误认的，不得作为商标使用。\n\r\n\r\n《广告法》第九条规定：广告不得使用“国家级”、“最高级”、“最佳”等用语。\n\r\n\r\n因此，宣传中使用“遥遥领先”用语，涉嫌不正当竞争，属于虚假内容，因此属于违反广告法。\n\r\n\r\n如果商家在宣传中使用了“遥遥领先”描述自己的产品，而实际产品的质量、性能并没有领先同行很多，则可能承担如下《广告法》规定的如下法律责任：由市场监督管理部门责令停止发布广告，对广告主处二十万元以上一百万元以下的罚款，情节严重的，并可以吊销营业执照，由广告审查机关撤销广告审查批准文件、一年内不受理其广告审查申请；对广告经营者、广告发布者，由市场监督管理部门没收广告费用，处二十万元以上一百万元以下的罚款，情节严重的，并可以吊销营业执照。\n\r\n\r\n我觉得，如果这种商标能审核通过的话，商标法和广告法就纯属摆设了。",

          "description": "《萤火虫之墓》这部影片展现了在1945年的战争阴影下一对普通兄妹的生活和命运，母亲在空袭被炸死，兄妹成了孤儿，在食品短缺的情况下，最后不得不流浪街头，战争结束了，父亲也战死，妹妹和哥哥在无依无靠的情况下先后活活饿死。\n\r\n\r\n影片通过战乱下兄妹的悲惨生活，让人们看到了战争的残酷与无情，以及战争环境下普通人的毫无尊严和权利，让人们思考，这样的战争到底是为了什么？\n\r\n\r\n我觉得，理性的说，兄妹之死，和哥哥太要面子有关，战争时期谁的日子也不好过，所谓大丈夫能屈能伸，如果哥哥能放弃自己的尊严，寄人篱下，帮助房东做些家务事，不要整天就知道带着妹妹四处玩，也不至于遭到姨妈的白眼，那么兄妹可能不会活活饿死。\n\r\n\r\n我关注这部电影的主要原因是，这部电影原先评分很高，入选豆瓣250，但近两年却排名大幅下降，很多人给这部电影刷低分，让我很好奇这部电影为什么那么多人打低分，打低分的动机到底是什么。\n\r\n\r\n《萤火虫之墓》通过儿童的视角展现了战争对普通人民生活的摧残，强烈地传达了反战的主题。甚至在当代，乃至世界各国，都有很强烈的现实意义。\n\r\n\r\n对外发动侵略战争，以及战争对民众的影响是反战电影的重要主题之一。\n\r\n\r\n民众支持政府的时候，要想想，万一战争长久进行下去，甚至失败了，那时候民众自己会是怎么样的悲惨状况，战争通常会导致无辜的平民成为受害者，包括儿童。他们可能因为战争而失去家庭、饥饿、疾病、暴力等而遭受极大的痛苦。\n\r\n\r\n通过这样的电影，观众被引导去思考战争对人类生活和社会带来的破坏，以及反战和和平的重要性。这是一种强烈的现实警示，提醒我们反思战争的可怕后果，千万不要盲目支持政府对外发动战争。\n\r\n\r\n《萤火虫之墓》不仅在日本，还在世界范围内引发了对战争和人性的深刻思考，成为一部具有永恒价值的电影，在IMDb 250中排名高达44名。\n\r\n\r\n希望俄罗斯的民众，加沙的民众，都好好看看这部电影，不要盲目支持战争，要想想对外战争可能会给自己带来的可怕后果。",

When this happens, the CPU\n\tenters a confused state that causes the instruction pointer to be\n\tmiscalculated.\n\n\tThe machine can eventually recover from this state, perhaps with\n\tincorrect intermediate results, but becoming internally consistent\n\tagain.

          "description": "Years ago, the list of mounted filesystems on a Unix or Linux machine was\nrelatively short and static.  Adding a filesystem, which typically involved\nbuying a new drive, happened rarely.  In contrast, contemporary systems\nwith a large number of containers can have a long and dynamic list of\nmounted filesystems.  As was discussed at\nthe 2023 LSFMM+BPF Summit, the Linux\nkernel's mechanism for providing information about mounted filesystems has\nnot kept up with this change, leading to system-management headaches.  Now,\ntwo new system calls proposed\nby Miklos Szeredi look set to provide some much-needed pain relief.",

More\nrecently, NUMA nodes have also been pressed into service to represent\ndifferent classes of memory; those nodes are now organized into tiers\naccording to their performance characteristics.  While memory-allocation\npolicies can control the placement of pages at the NUMA-node level, the\nkernel provides no way to connect those policies with memory tiers.  This\npatch series from Gregory Price aims to change this situation by\nallowing allocations to be placed across tiers in a weighted manner.",
