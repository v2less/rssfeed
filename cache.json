          "description": "Hi, all! Author here. What started as a small tool I built for a job interview, became \"The Most Over-engineered Deal With It Emoji Generator\":\n- All operations done fully client-side - no backend, no private data leaves your browser.\n- Uses machine learning models (MediaPipe Face Detector task) to automatically scale and position glasses on the detected faces.\n- Extensive customization options for glasses:\n  - Placement of glasses anywhere on the input image (including slightly going outside it).\n  - Change the size of glasses.\n  - No limit on the number of glasses.\n  - Flip the glasses vertically or horizontally.\n  - Customize the direction from which the glasses appear on the image.\n  - Different types of glasses.\n- GIF output options:\n  - Looping mode.\n  - Number of frames.\n  - Frame delay.\n  - Separate delay setting for last frame.\n  - Output size.\n- Celebration confetti \n- Easter eggs.\nI've been working remotely for the last >9 years. When using non-verbal communication, it's important that your tone and intent comes across accurately.. Custom emojis became for me part of expressing yourself, creating bonds and camaraderie. I've originally created an MVP of this tool while applying for a exciting new job opportunity. As a showcase of my passion for programming, building teams and creating delightful user experiences. Unfortunately, they were not impressed and ultimately did not offer me the job :( But I wanted to polish it and release it for everyone to use for free, so that you can too \"Deal With It\"!\nI have more ideas for even more features (check GitHub[1]), but wanted to launch it and see what's the feedback and ideas from the community!\nAnd if you're looking for a Fullstack Developer with >14 years of experience, with passion for great customer experience (remote work or locally in Iceland), let's chat!\n[1] - https://github.com/klimeryk/dealwithit\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41848150\nPoints: 509\n# Comments: 104",

          "description": "With these 3d captures, you can explore the 4km tunnel system that archaeologists created inside the temples at Copan that are closed to the public. The tunnels are often flooded by hurricanes and damaged by other natural forces--and collapsed on me and my Matterport scanner more than once--so this is a permanent record of how they appeared in 2022-23.\nUnlike Egyptian pyramids, the Maya built their temples layer by layer outward, so to understand them, researchers tunneled into the structures to understand the earlier phases of construction. I arranged the guided versions of the virtual tours in a rough chronology, moving from the highest to the lowest and oldest areas: the hieroglyphic stairway composing the largest Maya inscription anywhere, the Rosalila temple that was buried fully intact, and finally the tomb of the Founder of the city, Yax Kʼukʼ Moʼ.\nI've been working to build on top of the Matterport SDK with Three.js--and then reusing the data in Unreal for a desktop experience or rendering for film (coming soon to PBS).\nBlog about process: https://blog.mused.com/what-lies-beneath-digitally-recording...\nMajor thanks to the Matterport team for providing support with data alignment and merging tunnels while I was living in the village near site.\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41848099\nPoints: 162\n# Comments: 34",

          "description": "I created an enhanced fork of the popular MacProxy project called MacProxy Plus, which makes it possible to browse the modern web on vintage hardware. You run MPP on a machine on your local network and configure the Mac (or other vintage computer) to use it as a proxy server. MPP converts HTTPS to HTTP, strips out CSS, JavaScript, and other tags the Mac's browser doesn't recognize, then serves super-simplified HTML that actually loads pretty fast on the nearly 40 year old machine. Custom handling is enabled by \"extensions\" (individual python scripts) which intercept requests for given domains (like chatgpt.com) and return simple HTML interfaces. Current extensions include Weather, ChatGPT, Anthropic Claude, Wikipedia, Reddit, Hackaday, WayBack Machine, Web Simulator, and (not) YouTube. Though this solution was developed with early Macs in mind, it should also work to get many other vintage computers online.\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41847948\nPoints: 44\n# Comments: 18",

It allows to send audio and messages in real-time and on demand between network endpoints - not only in local networks, but also over the public internet!\nThe C/C++ library can be easily embedded in host applications or plugins. It even runs on embedded devices, such as the ESP32. In addition, the project contains a Pure Data external and a SuperCollider extension.\nThe following article provides a high level introduction and demonstrates some use cases: https://www.soundingfuture.com/en/article/aoo-low-latency-pe...\nAOO has been in development since 2020 and it has been used in several art projects since.

I realized that if I wanted to analyze how a certain thing changes wrt to multiple variables by plotting it, I had to create a bunch of copies of data and copy my formulas everywhere... a SWE nightmare!\nTenno simplifies this because you can essentially define a function you are interested in, and only the analyzing it using plots that explore various dimensions.\nBTW, you can also use Tenno to build dashboards by pulling data from APIs, checkout the weather data example.\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41798477\nPoints: 251\n# Comments: 105",

          "description": "Been working on a desktop app for Mac that lets you create web flows and rerun them (https://www.donobu.com/).\nYou can optionally use AI (BYOK: bring your own keys) to create flows for you and to do other interesting things, like making vision-based semantic assertions. Also, your data lives on your own filesystem, and we do not see any of it (further still, there is no phoning home at all). A nice benefit of this being a desktop app rather than a SAAS product, is that if you happen to be developing/iterating on a webpage locally, this has no problem hooking into it.\nWhat this intends to be a good fit for:\n- Testing web pages, especially locally.\n- Exploring random webpages with a stated objective.\n- Automating tedious flows. Rerunning a flow won't get caught up on using a single selector (many websites randomize element IDs, for instance), there is smart failover using a prioritized list of selectors.\n- Getting a quick draft of an end-to-end test in Javascript.\nWhat this is a bad fit for:\n- Mass web scraping (too slow).\n- Adversarial websites.\nWhat we are still working out:\n- Click-and-drag operations.\n- Websites that are primarily controlled from canvas.\n- Smoothing out UI/UX (we are two backend engineers trying our best, and are handedly outgunned by real frontend engineers).\nFun things to try:\n- Asking it to assert that a webpage has a certain theme.\n- Asking it to run an accessibility report for a page (uses https://github.com/dequelabs/axe-core).\n- Asking it to run a cookie report for a page.\nThe tech:\n- Java 21 for the main business logic.\n- Javalin 6 for the web framework (https://javalin.io/).\n- Playwright for controlling the browser (https://playwright.dev/java/).\n- Axe for running accessibility reports (https://github.com/dequelabs/axe-core).\nCritical feedback is welcome. Thanks for trying it out!\nCheers,\n-Justin and Vaz\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41789633\nPoints: 53\n# Comments: 12",

It enables teams to easily create and manage high-quality datasets, and streamlines the entire workflow from fine-tuning to serving and evaluating models with domain experts. You can check out our docs here: (https://docs.finetunedb.com/)\nFinetuneDB exists because creating and managing high-quality datasets is a real bottleneck when fine-tuning LLMs. The quality of your data directly impacts the performance of your fine-tuned models, and existing tools didn’t offer an easy way for teams to build, organize, and iterate on their datasets.

I hope you like the themes we’ve built so far, and maybe even get inspired to build your own.\nI know Web Components are in a bit of a drama cycle right now. I’m happy to see them get any attention really. I’ve been pretty bullish on them since ~2013 when I started working with them, at least in the context of a widget like a video player. I’ve even given many related talks on them like this one (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6Mh84SRoDg).\nI would never push them for a large app or as a full replacement for React, but they’ve been incredible for making video players that are compatible across many contexts, and Player.style is a clear demonstration of that when you get to the step of embedding a …",

          "description": "Manipulating monetary amounts is a common computing chore. However, no mainstream language has a first-class data type for representing money, it’s up to programmers to code abstractions for it. This isn’t an issue per se until dealing with rounding issues from operations like installment payments (e.g., buy now, pay later), foreign exchange, or even simple things like fee processing and tax collection.\nInspired by my days at N26 Brasil dealing with these challenges, I introduce Money: a Kotlin library that makes monetary calculations and allocations easy.\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41776878\nPoints: 315\n# Comments: 182",

          "description": "1. In the US, about 1/5 children are hospitalized each year that don’t have a caregiver. Caregiver such as play therapists and parents’ stress can also affect children's emotions.\n2. Not everyone is good at making friends and not everyone has a BFF to talk to. Imagine you're having a hard time in life or at work, and you can't tell your parents or friends.\nSo, we built an open-source project Starmoon and are using affordable hardware components to bring AI characters to real-word objects like toys and plushies to help people emotional growth.\nWe believe this is a complement tool and it is not intended to replace anyone.

          "description": "Dear HN,\nI’m excited to show case a personal project. It has helped me quite a bit with my home lab, I hope it can help you with yours too! ffmpeg-over-ip has two components, a server and a client. You can run the server in an environment with access to a GPU and a locally installed version of ffmpeg, the client only needs network access to the server and no GPU or ffmpeg locally.\nBoth and client and the server need a shared filesystem for this to work (so the server can write output to it, and client can read from it). In my usecase, smb works well if your (GPU) server is a windows machine, nfs works really well for linux setups.\nThis utility can be useful in a number of scenarios:\n- You find passing through a (v)GPU to your virtual machines complicated\n- You want to use the same GPU for ffmpeg in multiple virtual machines\n- Your server has a weak GPU so you want to use the GPU from your gaming machine\n- Your GPU drivers in one OS are not as good as another (AMD RX6400 never worked for me in linux, but did so in windows)\nI’ve posted some instructions in the Github package README, please let me know if they are unclear in any way and I’ll try to help!\nHere's the link: https://github.com/steelbrain/ffmpeg-over-ip\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41743780\nPoints: 52\n# Comments: 28",

          "description": "Hey HN, we've been working with OpenAI for the past few months on the new Realtime API.\nThe goal is to give everyone access to the same stack that underpins Advanced Voice in the ChatGPT app.\nUnder the hood it works like this:\n- A user's speech is captured by a LiveKit client SDK in the ChatGPT app\n- Their speech is streamed using WebRTC to OpenAI’s voice agent\n- The agent relays the speech prompt over websocket to GPT-4o\n- GPT-4o runs inference and streams speech packets (over websocket) back to the agent\n- The agent relays generated speech using WebRTC back to the user’s device\nThe Realtime API that OpenAI launched is the websocket interface to GPT-4o. This backend framework covers the voice agent portion. Besides having additional logic like function calling, the agent fundamentally proxies WebRTC to websocket.\nThe reason for this is because websocket isn’t the best choice for client-server communication. The vast majority of packet loss occurs between a server and client device and websocket doesn’t provide programmatic control or intervention in lossy network environments like WiFi or cellular. Packet loss leads to higher latency and choppy or garbled audio.\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41743327\nPoints: 34\n# Comments: 3",

It unifies React Native and React web with typed file system routing by making Vite able to serve RN. This lets you share (or diverge) your code in a simpler way for cross-platform apps.\n2. We've partnered with Zero (https://zerosync.dev) to make local-first work well. We've been building a solution in One that makes Zero supporting server rendering, without waterfalls, and with seamless server/client handoff.\n---\nHonestly - I'm a bit hesitant to post One here.\nHN has really soured on frontend/frameworks.

That got the ball rolling and I kept adding stuff: covers in ascii and then as sixel images, a playlist view, a visualizer, a library view and finally search.\nWhile kew can be used as a commandline tool, it has evolved into a TUI app.\nHere are some example commands:\nkew nirvana     # Plays all of your Nirvana songs, shuffled\nkew nevermind   # Plays the \"Nevermind\" album in order\nkew spirit  # Plays \"Smells Like Teen Spirit\"\nkew all         # Plays all your music, shuffled\nkew albums      # Plays one album after the other in random order\nIt works best when your music library is organized like this:\nArtist/Album(s)/Track(s)\nkew is written in C and licensed under GPLv2.\nSource and screenshot: https://github.com/ravachol/kew\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41740915\nPoints: 109\n# Comments: 43",

          "description": "Hi HN,\nMageCDN is a simple and affordable image hosting service I have been working on for the past few weeks. The idea came out of my own frustration with hosting and optimizing images for my blog.\nWhile platforms like Imgur make it really simple to upload images, they don't allow you to embed them. Services like Cloudinary, Imagekit exist, but I found them too complex for my needs. Plus, they get really expensive past their free tier.\nSo, I started MageCDN with three simple goals:\n- pricing should be affordable and scale linearly.\n- basic image operations (resize, crop, optimize) should be doable within the app.\n- uploading and getting a link you can use should be fast and hassle-free.\nWould love to hear what you think!\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41731720\nPoints: 9\n# Comments: 2",

          "description": "Hi HN,\nI’m excited to share Kameo, a lightweight Rust library that helps you build fault-tolerant, distributed, and asynchronous actors. If you're working on distributed systems, microservices, or real-time applications, Kameo offers a simple yet powerful API for handling concurrency, panic recovery, and remote messaging between nodes.\nKey Features:\n- Async Rust: Each actor runs as a separate Tokio task, making concurrency management simple.\n- Remote Messaging: Seamlessly send messages to actors across different nodes.\n- Supervision and Fault Tolerance: Create self-healing systems with actor hierarchies.\n- Backpressure Support: Supports bounded and unbounded mpsc messaging.\nI built Kameo because I wanted a more intuitive, scalable solution for distributed Rust applications. I’d love feedback from the HN community and contributions from anyone interested in Rust and actor-based systems.\nCheck out the project on GitHub: https://github.com/tqwewe/kameo\nLooking forward to hearing your thoughts!\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41723569\nPoints: 50\n# Comments: 13",

          "description": "I’m looking for a job and like many people in this situation am finding it unusually difficult.\nI’ve read rumors that many firms are actually in a hiring freeze, but they keep job reqs open for appearances. Apparently some investors use job postings as a company health metric.\nFrom my contacts, I am personally aware of situations where internally-recommended CVs are ignored by HR, and other cases had open job postings and passed people successfully through the interview process, and then the hiring manager still didn’t pull the trigger. I have no way of knowing how widespread this is, but it is happening at some places.\nIs your company like this? If you have real info and not just suspicions, let’s name some names.\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41714672\nPoints: 34\n# Comments: 0",

You have to comb through your whole app and look for what needs to be translated and manually update your translations every time new stuff gets added. People sometimes hire their own in-house translators, or they send off their translations to humans to be translated, which takes days, weeks, or worse and costs a ton.

We help companies turn their content into AI support copilots.\nSo far, we’d focused on customer-facing experiences (e.g. find us as an “Ask AI” button in the docs of companies like Anthropic and Pinecone). Today, we’re excited to share our new copilot, Keep, which is designed specifically for support agents.\nIt’s a conversational sidebar you can use as an app for Zendesk or Chrome Extension for any support platform. There’s a demo video at https://vid.inkeep.com/cx-copilot or you can try the live sandbox with example tickets at https://try.inkeep.com/cx-copilot.\nWhy?

It requires no external dependencies, no setup, no superuser privileges, and no code modifications.\nI'm sharing it with you today because I use it regularly, and it seems like others have found it useful too—so it might be helpful for you as well.\nHope you will like it.\ncle\nSource: https://github.com/cle-b/httpdbg\nDocumentation: https://httpdbg.readthedocs.io/\nA blog post on a use case: https://medium.com/@cle-b/trace-all-your-http-requests-in-py...\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41650905\nPoints: 73\n# Comments: 30",

I’ve used coroutines for task encapsulation and C++23 expected for exception handling, while trying to maintain good performance.\nAdditionally, I’ve implemented monadic-like behavior to allow easy chaining of tasks, similar to the monadic operations in std::expected.\nYou can check out the project here: https://github.com/mtmucha/coros\nWhile this library isn’t fully-fledged or production-ready, I’d really appreciate your feedback!\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41647025\nPoints: 59\n# Comments: 39",

          "description": "Hey HN! We're Raymond Xu and Raffi Isanians, the team behind Modern Realty (https://modernrealty.io). Modern Realty is an AI-powered real estate buying experience that helps you purchase homes without relying on a traditional realtor. Demo: https://youtu.be/VhsWSVn5blA\nOur mission at Modern Realty is to make home buying easier, faster, and far more enjoyable. We interpret real estate data, giving you an edge on other home buyers.\nSince 2024, there has been a growing need for innovative solutions in real estate, especially with tools like Zillow making it easier than ever for buyers to find the right house at the right price. However, the process still requires an agent, even though buyers are doing most of the work themselves. Modern Realty changes this by offering an AI self-service solution.\nRaymond and Raffi came face-to-face with this technology's potential while working on AI at Google and handling billion-dollar asset transactions as an attorney, respectively. The AI tools we've built guide users through every step of the home-buying process, from scheduling showings to making offers, all without the need for a traditional agent.\nBefore we expand further, this summer we've built our core AI real estate agent, which can handle everything from disclosure summaries to competitive market analyses. You can see our platform in action at https://modernrealty.io. We're particularly proud of our offer generation tool, which creates offers that are then reviewed by an attorney at no additional cost.\nWe're excited to be launching here on HN and would love to hear what you think! If you're in the market for a new home or just curious about the future of real estate, visit our website or schedule a call with us to get started.\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41638199\nPoints: 90\n# Comments: 187",

          "description": "Hey HN! We’re Emma and Chris, founders of Velvet (https://www.usevelvet.com).\nVelvet proxies OpenAI calls and stores the requests and responses in your PostgreSQL database. That way, you can analyze logs with SQL (instead of a clunky UI). You can also set headers to add caching and metadata (for analysis).\nBackstory: We started by building some more general AI data tools (like a text-to-SQL editor). We were frustrated by the lack of basic LLM infrastructure, so ended up pivoting to focus on the tooling we wanted. So many existing apps, like Helicone, were hard to use as power users. We just wanted a database.\nScale: We’ve already warehoused 50m requests for customers, and have optimized the platform for scale and latency. We’ve built the proxy on Cloudflare Workers, and latency is nominal. We’ve built some “yak shaving” features that were really complex such as decomposing OpenAI Batch API requests so you can track each log individually. One of our early customers (https://usefind.ai/) makes millions of OpenAI requests per day, up to 1500 requests per second.\nVision: We’re trying to build development tools that have as little UI as possible, that can be controlled entirely with headers and code. We also want to blend cloud and on-prem for the best of both worlds — allowing for both automatic updates and complete data ownership.\nHere are some things you can do with Velvet logs:\n- Observe requests, responses, and latency\n- Analyze costs by metadata, such as user ID\n- Track batch progress and speed\n- Evaluate model changes\n- Export datasets for fine-tuning of gpt-4o-mini\n(this video shows how to do each of those: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KaFkRi5ESi8)\n--\nTo see how it works, try chatting with our demo app that you can use without logging in: https://www.usevelvet.com/sandbox\nSetting up your own proxy is 2 lines of code and takes ~5 mins.\nTry it out and let us know what you think!\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41637550\nPoints: 8\n# Comments: 2",

          "description": "Hi HN!\nI made a live presidential polling website with real-time electoral results. Votes can be changed at any time until the poll closes. Only visitors from the USA can participate. Congressional district is detected automatically.\nThe idea is to enable a coordinated voting process, where selections are non-binding and negotiable rather than blindly cast once. Kind of like a presidential caucus, but national and over the Internet.\nThe infra is Fastly & DigitalOcean. Backend is a Django service running on DO App Platform with Postgres. Fastly is used for edge logic, captcha, geo location, and pushing updates to the page (Fanout). In theory it should be able to handle millions of participants.\nNote: since my previous post, I've added a way to close the poll after a time period. I realized that without some kind of time boxing it was unclear what the point is or how long to participate.\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41630976\nPoints: 4\n# Comments: 1",

          "description": "Hey HN, we recently fine-tuned the llama3.1 405B model on 8xAMD MI300x GPUs using JAX instead of PyTorch. JAX's advanced sharding APIs allowed us to achieve great performance. Check out our blog post to learn about the cool sharding tricks we used. We've also open-sourced the code: https://github.com/felafax/felafax\nWe're a small startup building AI infra for fine-tuning and serving LLMs on non-NVIDIA hardware (TPUs, AMD, Trainium).\nProblem: Many companies are trying to get PyTorch working on AMD GPUs, but we believe this is a treacherous path. PyTorch is deeply intertwined with the NVIDIA ecosystem in a lot of ways (e.g., `torch.cuda` or scaled_dot_product_attention is an NVIDIA CUDA kernel exposed as a PyTorch function). So, to get PyTorch code running on non-NVIDIA hardware, there's a lot of \"de-NVIDIAfying\" that needs to be done.\nSolution: We believe JAX is a better fit for non-NVIDIA hardware. In JAX, ML model code compiles to hardware-independent HLO graphs, which are then optimized by the XLA compiler before hardware-specific optimization. This clean separation allowed us to run the same LLaMA3 JAX code both on Google TPUs and AMD GPUs with no changes.\nOur strategy as a company is to invest upfront in porting models to JAX, then leverage its framework and XLA kernels to extract maximum performance from non-NVIDIA backends. This is why we first ported Llama 3.1 from PyTorch to JAX, and now the same JAX model works great on TPUs and runs perfectly on AMD GPUs.\nWe'd love to hear your thoughts on our vision and repo!\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41630913\nPoints: 12\n# Comments: 0",

It's about how to organize programs around data \"as plain data\" and the surprisingly benefits that emerge when we do. Programs that are built around the data they manage tend to be simpler, smaller, and significantly easier understand.\nJava has changed radically over the last several years. It has picked up all kinds of new language features which support data oriented programming (records, pattern matching, `with` expressions, sum and product types). However, this is not a book about tools. No amount of studying a screw-driver will teach you how to build a house. This book focuses on house building. We'll pick out a plot of land, lay a foundation, and build upon it house that can weather any storm.\nDoP is based around a very simple idea, and one people have been rediscovering since the dawn of computing, \"representation is the essence of programming.\" When we do a really good job of capturing the data in our domain, the rest of the system tends to fall into place in a way which can feel like it’s writing itself.\nThat's my elevator pitch! The book is currently in early access. I hope you check it out. I'd love to hear your feedback.\nYou can get 50% off (thru October 9th) with code `mlkiehl`\nhttps://www.manning.com/books/data-oriented-programming-in-j...\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41629377\nPoints: 217\n# Comments: 64",

Working with startups, doing interviews and sifting through endless software reviews are daunting tasks. So, we built a chatbot that lets you chat with over 3 million reviews from more than 100K SaaS products.\nWith Reviewradar, you can ask questions like:\n- create a comprehensive SWOT analysis for both Notion and Obsidian\n- give me negative feedback and complaints you have about Postmark\n- summarise the reviews you have on products in the OCR category\nI would love to get your feedback on it. Check it out here: https://reviewradar.ai\nLooking forward to your thoughts / suggestions,\nAndrei and Roman\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41616763\nPoints: 76\n# Comments: 35",

          "description": "Hi HN!  I’m Tony, one of the co-founders of Inngest (https://inngest.com/)\nInngest is an open-source durable workflow platform that works on any cloud.  Durable workflows are stateful, long running step functions written in code, which automatically retry on failure.  It abstracts everything about queues, event streams and state for you, letting you focus on code.  Some examples of uses:  managing stateful AI chained step functions;  managing search/rag indexes and data pipelines;  integrations and webhooks;  billing and payment flows.\nTechnical details:  unlike other solutions, we put lots of effort into designing our SDK’s step.run APIs to make them extremely easy to use — developer experience is the most important thing for us.\nWe had to design and build our own queueing system to work with multi-tenancy, batching, and debouncing, and we’re iterating on this as we move to FoundationDB.  It’s largely all Go in the backend, with a bunch of caching, clickhouse, event streams, and coordination on our behalf.  Workers are shared nothing, and run based off of the queue and execution state.\nWe did a post last year as we iterated on our TS SDK.  The product has changed a lot since then and wanted to show the community what’s changed as we reach 1.0:\n    * Golang, Java, and Python SDKs with cross-language function invocation (across clouds, too)\n\n    * Multi-tenant aware flow control (concurrency, throttling, debounce)\n\n    * Batching, grouping many events into a single function call\n\n    * Much improved dashboard, with tracing and metrics built in\n\n    * Advanced recovery tools like function replay, temporary pausing,  bulk cancellation (with optional expressions).  No more dead letter queues!\n\n    * Branch deploys built in, with staging env support out of the box\n\n    * Full local testing with production parity\n\n\nWanted to say thank you to the HN community for feedback so far!  Happy Friday :)\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41604042\nPoints: 83\n# Comments: 26",

          "description": "We just released a very excited touch sensor that finally simplifies touch sensing for robotics.\nOur most exciting result: Learned visuotactile policies for precise tasks like inserting USBs and credit card swiping, that work out-of-the-box when you replace skins! To the best of our knowledge, this has never been shown before with any existing tactile sensor.\nWhy is this important? For the first time, you could now collect data and train models on one sensor and expect them to generalize to new copies of the sensor -- opening the door to the kind of large foundation models that have revolutionized vision and language reasoning.\nWould love to hear the community's questions, thoughts and comments!\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41603865\nPoints: 166\n# Comments: 26",

          "description": "Numscript is a simple, declarative language that helps you model financial transactions. You can do quite a few things with it, such as modeling:\n* Payments involving vouchers and a user's prepaid balance\n* Complex funds destination scenario where the customer gets cash back\n* Configurable user credit balance spending transactions\nThe main idea is to take the pain out of describing of a system dealing with money movements should behave in traditional languages such as JS/TS/Go/Ruby etc, landing an expressive way to model these movements of value.\nIt is voluntarily broad in applicability—our customers use it today for use-cases ranging from marketplaces funds orchestration to home-grown loan management systems.\nOnce those transactions are modeled, they are to be picked up and committed to a system-of-record, ledgering system or executed on a set of payments and banking APIs.\nIt was initially a DSL we bundled into our Core Ledger product at Formance (YCS21) but we're giving it more autonomy now and started to make it standalone, with the idea that anyone could eventually bolt Numscript on top of their ledgering system. We're also exploring to make it natively compatible with other backends.\nAs part of this un-bundling, we've just shipping a playground which lets you fiddle with it without installing anything at https://playground.numscript.org/ (it works best on desktop).\nHappy to chime in on any questions!\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41593216\nPoints: 103\n# Comments: 21",

          "description": "Hi HN,\nWe are Cyril & Ulric and are building Marblism (https://marblism.com), an LLM-based dev platform to generate and iterate on full-stack web apps.\nHere’s a demo video that goes from a comment on Twitter to a working app in 10 minutes: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TapOPO-Gv20.\nMarblism started when we realized that much of the code we write for web apps is just slightly modified boilerplate: similar login flows, dashboards, API integrations, CRUD operations, etc. While AI tools are helpful, they fall short in delivering a well-architected codebase. The idea of Marblism is to combine the best of both worlds: a solid boilerplate, customized and enhanced with AI.\nHere's how it works:\nGenerate your app -  Describe your product, and the AI will build your data model. We create a NextJS app with auth, custom CRUDs, permissions, payment, emails. The AI then generates your front-end pages.\nTest and improve your app - Now that your app is set up, use our online workspace to test your app and add more complex features via an AI Chat or directly yourself in the VSCode editor.\nGo live - Once you’re happy with your app, deploy it in production in one click.\nHere are some examples of apps generated on Marblism in couple of hours of prompting:\nFind and validate startup ideas: https://www.muckbrass.com/\nA design system directory: https://awesomedesignsystem.app.io\nAI-Personalized candle: https://www.scent-a-scene.com/\nMarblism currently generates web apps like SaaS, marketplaces, and social networks. It doesn't support Chrome extensions or mobile apps, and it’s not really for small games like Snake/Tetris.\nThe vision is to add more tech stacks later this year and enable people to create their own templates/tech stack that the AI can customize.\nWe’re really excited to share this with you and we'd love to hear your thoughts on the potential directions we can take this product.\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41568343\nPoints: 81\n# Comments: 58",

          "description": "Last year we launched a project called Psychic that did moderately well on hacker news, but was a commercial failure. We were able to find customers, but none with compelling and overlapping use cases. Everyone who was interested was too early to be a real customer.\nThis was our launch: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36032081\nWe recently decided to revive and rebrand the project after seeing a sudden spike in interest from people who wanted to connect LLMs to data - but specifically through browsers. It's also a problem we've experienced firsthand, having built scraping features into Psychic and previously working on bot detection at Robinhood.\nIf you haven’t built a web scraper or browser automation before, you might assume it’s very straightforward.

          "description": "Hey HN! I'm Caleb, one of the contributors to Opik, a new open source framework for LLM evaluations.\nOver the last few months, my colleagues and I have been working on a project to solve what we see as the most painful parts of writing evals for an LLM application. For this initial release, we've focused on a few core features that we think are the most essential:\n- Simplifying the implementation of more complex LLM-based evaluation metrics, like Hallucination and Moderation.\n- Enabling step-by-step tracking, such that you can test and debug each individual component of your LLM application, even in more complex multi-agent architectures.\n- Exposing an API for \"model unit tests\" (built on Pytest), to allow you to run evals as part of your CI/CD pipelines\n- Providing an easy UI for scoring, annotating, and versioning your logged LLM data, for further evaluation or training.\nIt's often hard to feel like you can trust an LLM application in production, not just because of the stochastic nature of the model, but because of the opaqueness of the application itself. Our belief is that with better tooling for evaluations, we can meaningfully improve this situation, and unlock a new wave of LLM applications.\nYou can run Opik locally, or with a free API key via our cloud platform. You can use it with any model server or hosted model, but we currently have a built-in integration with the OpenAI Python library, which means it automatically works not just with OpenAI models, but with any model served via a compatible model server (ollama, vLLM, etc). Opik also currently has out-of-the-box integrations with LangChain, LlamaIndex, Ragas, and a few other popular tools.\nThis is our initial release of Opik, so if you have any feedback or questions, I'd love to hear them!\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41567192\nPoints: 57\n# Comments: 9",

          "description": "I've been learning about the L4 microkernel, and am thinking about doing something related to it for a research project.  I'm especially curious about more recent examples of specific devices that run L4 variants (seL4, PikeOS, OKL4, etc.).  I already found a few that use seL4, but to take OKL4 as an example, most of the specific devices I could find are from more than a decade ago, and I'm trying to find things from at least the last 5 or 6 years.  I'm even more curious to find devices that use a form of L4 as a hypervisor.\nHas anyone here worked on a device that used an L4-related kernel or hypervisor?  I know one major area they're used in is defense and full of NDAs, but hopefully some of the other industries they're used in (medical devices, automotive, IoT) are a little less restrictive.

Some of our recent hurricane forecasts can be visualized at https://hurricanes2024.silurian.ai/.\nWhat is it worth to know the weather forecast 1 day earlier? That’s not a hypothetical question, traditional forecasting systems have been improving their skill at a rate of 1 day per decade. In other words, today’s 6-day forecast is as accurate as the 5-day forecast ten years ago. No one expects this rate of improvement to hold steady, it has to slow down eventually, right? Well in the last couple years GPUs and modern deep learning have actually sped it up.\nSince 2022 there has been a flurry of weather deep learning system…",

          "description": "Recap: Terminals/shells call a program/command/tool, then none or more options and none or more files or directories. For example, cat [file] outputs the file contents to the terminal.\n GUI file explorers typically act the other way around, and that you select a file and then through double click/right click/dragging choose how you interact with it or what tool is used on that file. This seems easier for the purposes of discoverability, where it's easier to see what (recommended) options exist for a given file(type). (Disadvantages ignored, for the moment.)\n Are there any terminals/consoles/shells/etc (I am aware there's a lot of nuance I'm leaving out there, but for simplicity) that operate in a similar fashion, in which you enter a file and get recommended/use tab to see recommended options for tools/programs to use on the file? If not, do you know of any experiments of this sort?\n This is out of pure curiosity, I doubt I'd use such being used to how things are and how they work. I vaguely remember a 'one-instruction operating system', where you just select a file and the machine learning behind it determines what you want to do with it, but this was well over a decade ago, I can't find it again, and I don't recall if it was an experiment or a joke. Which I'm not all too keen on using, but comes to mind as the 'closest' to this that I can recall (or, in a sense, the most extreme). I am aware I'm oversimplify several things, and this is more a post of interest as to what might be rather than how much sense they make.\n Edit: attempt to avoid details about terminal != shell.\n Edit 2: please avoid downvotes, I wish to ask this in good faith as far as I can and am well aware that my form of questioning is not ideal, leaving room for well-meaning individuals who wish to set things straight.\n    submitted by    /u/madisander  \n [link]   [comments]",

We've seen big changes in short amounts of time before, just like the enormous uptick PC Gaming saw during the pandemic.\n [Earlier this year, India already reached nearly 15% Linux usage for desktops/laptops.\n Personally, I am going to direct all Windows users to Linux Mint, but that may change over time as a Debian user myself.\n    submitted by    /u/Jimbuscus  \n [link]   [comments]",

I knew windows 10 had a settings option for that but in windows 11 i had to use the Registry Editor. And just recently on my window 10 VM.

Basically, I was testing out how much RAM I could use before it would just crash (2GB in a VM ran for about 8 hours before it crashed). I was basically just using it as a Web Browser server really. It has been working great (this VM has 8GB of RAM and has been running about 16 hours now. I've watched YouTube videos, done Reddit stuff, etc... everything I normally do on my regular PC).\n It's a little more responsive than my main host. I run multiple browsers on it (YouTube is kind of useless on the VM because the audio isn't working. I've got something set wrong I think). But I have played videos just to make sure it won't crash. I played like 2 videos in the 2GB RAM VM and it crashed. I also had Reddit open and a search tab open as well. Yeah, it was pretty heavily used. The swap file still had over half the ram space left (1.5GB out of 3GB swap) but it still crashed. This is kind of why it's not imperative for me to have a swap file on my system. \n But overall, with this 8GB RAM VM... It's kinda nice. I gave it 120GB of drive space but I'll bet I can cut it down to about 40-60GB I think. I mean, if all I'm using it for is a browser, that should be plenty.\n So, this has been a fun experiment and something I'm considering keeping going. And if I can fix the audio issue in this VM, That would be awesome!\n And yes, I know, using 60GB of my main computers disk space seems like a waste and it may even be impractical. And I think I'm using more RAM than normal on my main system but I'm currently using 2229MB of RAM in this VM which is about what I'd be using on my regular system. Now I'm using 11GB of RAM. But ya know what? I've got 64GB total in this machine so... RAM UP PC!!! \n    submitted by    /u/Phydoux  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "TLDR: I used to obsess over and spend lots of time on software lists when trying to improve my desktop workflow, but after seeing how many different ones I would stop using after a while, I have stopped obsessing. Awesome lists are still good for getting a taste of an ecosystem but don't let them overwhelm you.\n Awesome lists like those found on Github for a specific OS, programming language, or other software / ecosystem. For instance: https://github.com/rockerBOO/awesome-neovim.\n I've done lots of thinking and work on my desktop workflow (trying to use my computer more efficiently) and came across them a lot. With my tendency to overthink and perfectionism, I would thoroughly read awesome lists to make sure I consider every single option for apps or software plugins, leading to dozens of tabs open to look through one by one. I wouldn't have time to read through all of them so I would make a bunch of bookmark folders, and sometimes I would open the lists over and over again to make sure I don't miss anything. I would have the feeling that I'm missing or one piece of software away from significantly improving my workflow which is why I thought I should keep going. Basically FOMO.\n Eventually I thought enough is enough. Now I think awesome lists are enough to quickly see what software is out there that might benefit you, and its easy to fall into the trap of overthinking since the lists tend to be extremely long. And it's common to have lots of things on the list that do the same thing / significantly overlap in functionality. They seem to prioritize quantity over quality, sometimes consisting largely of repos with no more than a few or few dozen stars and little documentation. Over time I learned to not obsess over software so much, especially after realizing how many different apps and plugins I've dropped over time.\n    submitted by    /u/TheTwelveYearOld  \n [link]   [comments]",

I'm a fairly technical person who wasn't too scared to use a terminal but I was clearly a novice when it came to Linux in general.

Like installing it on top/replacing system stuff, without messing up the /home directly and perhaps something else valuable (I know the better way is have /home as a separate partition).\n Since unlike other distros, Arch is installed with pacstrap and doesn't require you to re-format a partition you want to strap system on, I got curious if it's possible to just pacstrap other distro, perhaps Arch-based like Manjaro, and say \"You're Arch now\"? Perhaps it's not as straight forward as just pacstrapping packages, what would be needed to get done to get it working?

Currently I've setup NFS but it's a pain for the following reasons:\n  \nWhen you disconnect from the network the Gnome file manager (Nautalis) just hangs for a very long time. Gnome will pop up the dialog that asks to close or wait.\n Sometimes booting can take a long time (extra 1.5 minutes) if you have auto-mount enabled, but are not connected to the network.

My big gripe with WMs, as well as the reason I’m using KDE with a tiling extension right now, is that as far as I’m aware, there is no concept of a general centralized settings and collection of packaged utilites as distinct from a DE. There is no reason that such a thing shouldn’t exist beyond a natural predisposition of those who customize their systems personally to prefer to manage the little things themselves. It goes without saying that I am not in that category; I like minimalism and efficiency without wasting time digging into disparate file-based configs. I also like pretty-looking, cohesive applications, which just… isn’t going to happen I suppose. In other words, I want the helix editor of operating systems.\n I’m considered making such an app as a long term project if one doesn’t exist. I’m very new to the software development world (I prefer rust and haskell), so suggestions pertaining to how to structure the application, how to flavour it, features it should have, even which libraries to use are more than welcome.\n I’d also appreciate mentions of projects that do something similar to what I’ve described here. \n    submitted by    /u/AreaMean2418  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "In the past I published a quite popular Kwin Script on the KDE Store, called Autocomposer.\n The script disables composition on full-screen, to improve graphical performance and latency.\n But with Plasma 6, in their efforts to port Kwin to Wayland, they have removed the capability to disable composition through its API.\n Nevertheless, for Nvidia cards, graphical performance and latency are still superior on x11.\n Hence I have decided to reimplement Autocomposer in pure C and x11 API. While the Nvidia graphics are better optimized.\n This way Autocomposer now works with any x11 window manager that allows applications to block compositing.\n I have also optimized optimus-manager to work on Wayland. And it uses the integrated graphics to render the desktop, and the Nvidia GPU to render any GLX and Vulkan application.\n This way we can also achieve a similar effect on Wayland as what Autocomposer provides. It's just that the drivers aren't as good yet, but people may experiment more easily now.\n    submitted by    /u/es20490446e  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I have been using Linux exclusively for a few months now, eventually settled on Fedora KDE, and I am quite comfortable with it already, but from time to time I wonder if I am using a more vulnerable system due to lack of a real time process/behaviour based antimalware protection.\n Yes I know the whole rhetoric that Linux desktop distributions are inherently safer because they rely on vetted repositories, priviledge escalation, timely updates and open code auditing, as well as servers being more targetted than desktop. But as of 2024 with the increasing complexity of malware techniques that go way beyond just infected files (like perfectl which looks a bit scary), is it prudent running a internet-facing OS without a antimalware tool constantly monitoring suspicious process behaviour on the system?\n Using Fedora I am very confident that my system is not being spied and data mined, which is already great, and I follow the basic steps, secure boot is enabled, disk is encrypted with luks2, firewall is enabled, apply updates daily, be careful to verify any software from outside the repositories (appimages or flatpaks) and not escalating privileges to anything suspicious. But I wouldn't know what else to do from here. SELinux? Have not a clue how to manage it properly. Even managing the firewall I only understand the basics so far.\n Do you use your Linux distribution with default security settings or do you take extra hardening measures?\n    submitted by    /u/fmbernardo  \n [link]   [comments]",

The reason I am asking is that as someone who has installed gentoo many a times I am getting tired of installing it and having to go thru the whole rigamarole and recently discovered a script on github called oddlama and frankly it is quite nice but there are some changes that I want to add to it, as it looks to be written exclusively in shell I would like to have a crack at writing my own stuff.\n I have next to 0 experience in coding/programming/scripting, as a lad in his late teens who has no interest in doing anything computer related in life (i wish to be a physicist). Computers/coding and linux and exclusively out of interest and once im through with writing my personal statements (UK uni applications) I would like to learn C and C++.\n Reason I want to acctually contribute instead of just asking the current devs to add the changes I want is that A) i feel i have been just mouching off linux for a far to long now and actually want to contribute now that I know that I am never moving back to windows.\n B) I have a genuine interest in computers and coding but not to the level of wanting it to be my job lol.\n any guidance on how to learn shell scripting would be greatly apprecitated!\n    submitted by    /u/Realistic_Bee_5230  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "This issue is often misunderstood, and I think it's important to break it down because it's a real headache for those of us moving from Windows to Linux. I face this problem myself on a daily basis, and I just want to break it down in hopes maybe developers can see it and understnad it better from the perspective of UX.\n When people talk about wanting per-app volume controls, they usually think about audio streams. While this works in many situations, it's not always reliable and comes with its own set of quirks.\n Let's take Firefox as an example as it really highlights the problem.\n  \nNot really per-app: the control is per stream, which means every time you open a new tab or scroll through Reddit or Twitter and a video starts playing, a new stream pops up. You end up having to control each stream individually, which is a hassle. Yes I know Firefox is unique this way, but that's besides the point. Plus, please read the other points.\n \nControl limitations: those \"per stream\" audio controls don't act as a separate layer; they directly control the stream itself. So when you adjust the volume with these controls, you're really just changing the volume on the website. It's basically the same as lowering the volume of a YouTube video in the browser. This makes it pretty pointless for sites like YouTube that already have their own volume sliders for videos.\n \nStill too loud: picture this, the volume on a YouTube video is set to 1%, but it's still too loud. Now what? You can't really use those per-stream system controls effectively because they're not an extra layer on top of the stream; they are the stream, which is already at 1%. You'd have to lower the system/global volume setting but at that point it's not per app, is it? And every app is affected, which is not ideal at all.\n \n    submitted by    /u/YasirAnqa  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I've released a new version of cryptreboot, an MIT-licensed, drop-in reboot replacement for disk-encrypted Linux systems.\n The tool prompts for the passphrase before reboot, while the system is still fully operational and remotely accessible. This contrasts with a standard reboot, where the passphrase must be entered during early system initialization, often without network access.\n This version adds support for native ZFS encryption with a LUKS keystore (as implemented in Ubuntu) and continues to support classic, plain-LUKS encryption.\n No configuration is required—simply install the tool and use \"cryptreboot\" instead of \"reboot.\" It also integrates smoothly with Dropbear-enabled initramfs configurations, allowing cryptreboot to function as usual. For standard reboots or system power-ons, the disk can be unlocked remotely via SSH.\n To install on Ubuntu:\n sudo apt install ruby kexec-tools sudo gem install crypt_reboot \n For more information, visit the project homepage:\n https://phantomno.de/cryptreboot\n I hope you enjoy cryptreboot :) If you have any questions or feedback, I'd be happy to address them here.\n EDIT: I made a mistake in the post title. Of course, 0.3.1, not 3.0.1 is the the newly released version.\n    submitted by    /u/repawel  \n [link]   [comments]",

Honestly, I don't understand why we need to bring all of this into the open-source and Linux space. Shouldn't the main focus be on creating better software and improving tech?\n I feel like all this political talk is distracting from the actual tech discussions that made this community great in the first place. I mean, who really gives a fuck about these things in a tech-focused environment? We're here for Linux, not social movements.\n Also, doesn't adding these topics create a bias in the development of distros? What happens if a country decides to ban inclusive policies or restrict certain types of content, and the people working on those distros are heavily involved in those movements? Wouldn't that lead to a risk of distro compromise, or even entire projects being banned or restricted? It seems like a dangerous path when we could just focus on tech.\n Why can't we go back to focusing on what matters: building, coding, and tech innovation?

But soon it striked me: if we can't measure this, how can we know Linux has a 4.5% market share ? It can be much more... or much less. This makes \"the year of Linux Desktop\" impossible to reach as we don't know how we are doing.\n There should be a way around this.\n I would be glad to read ideas on how to measure this. Here are some points:\n 1-Data from google searches. Quantify terms related to distro/OS.\n 2-Social aproach: ask for people share their data.\n 3-OS installation informs data. A simple step on OS installation that informs installation of a certain distro and ask for the distros to include this in their build. Maybe some would refuse, but if they understand that this would be good to them also we can have at least some info.\n 4-Number of downloads per distro. Not reliable, but better than nothing and we can normalize the data comparatively if there is any other source of data.\n 5-Convice google/search engines to share data on server variables the browser sends to them. One of the server variables is the OS identification\n 6-Daemon that measures uptime and shares data.\n 7-Measure number of ips that accessed a distro's page on a configured browser's start page. I mean, every participating distro would configure it's browser to access their project start page. Then they could share how many individual ips accessed that page.\n Some of the ideas above are not reliable. Consider them as a brainstorm.

I think the main difficult of fractional scaling is the software must decide how to round odd numbers. E.g.: 3 px at 150% scale is 4.5 px. The gui has to decide what to choose in this case, 4 or 5? And this for all the elements (buttons, labels, scrollbars, etc.) in each window. I also have this kind of problem, since many years, but I never used any gui scaling method. Instead, I always increased the font dpi: the gui remains slim and compact, and beautiful. Wouldn't it better to scale the gui for the integer part and the font for the fractional part?

Their is always simply entering \"history\" but that gets pretty convoluted after a while. So it got me wondering if there is a project already made where you can add options to the end of code that saves said code into a specified text file while still running it, it could also use options for deciding if the code is saved on next line of said file or if its formatted as a new topic(for instance skip two lines and add topic name with the code indented underneath)\n example 1:\n touch file1 -in /txt-file-path/ \n -i = import code\n -n = newline\n /file-path/ = text file of codes in said subject (network,video,sound,security, etc)\n example 2:\n touch file1 -it /txt-file-path/ \"topic-name\" \n -i = import code\n -t = new topic\n /file-path/ = text file of codes in said subject (network,video,sound,security, etc)\n 'topic name'\n This is just a random thought i had but i figured id see if it already exists or if its unnecessary/not possible\n edit: just to clear it up a bit im really just looking for a way to copy paste my current command in a cli to a text file by adding an argument to the end of the command. Added features outside of that for organizing the text in the file would just be extra\n    submitted by    /u/Joedirty18  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Recently, I have discovered that Gnome Wayland will flash the whole screen with a white color every time a screenshot is taken. This effect is only applied when something else that the builtin screenshot tool takes a screenshot. \n So, every time an external app takes a screenshot, Gnome will flash-bang you for a split second, with a screen full of white. \n I suffer from severe migraines, and this effect immediately makes me fell sick. \n What is even worse is that there seems to be little to no cool-down between those flashes. If a tool takes screenshots often, you will get your own light show. I had the misfortune of running a screenshot processing benchmark before I discovered this obnoxious \"feature\" of Gnome Wayland. So, I got blasted with an effect after effect. Every time one faded, the next one flashed me in the eyes. Some of those effects even queued due to lag, and then played all at once. \n So, if you are considering switching to Gnome Wayland, and have any sort of sensitivity to light, please be very careful. \n It seems like the only way to disable this potentially dangerous effect is going in accessibility, and selecting Reduce Animation, and disabling almost all the animations in Gnome(which makes it look quite bad). This is a shame, because this is the only effect that i have any kind of issue with.\n If you have any issues with flashing lights, I would recommend turning that setting on.\n    submitted by    /u/FractalFir  \n [link]   [comments]",

I thought that was because the laptop refuses to use any parts not made by the manufacturer. so I returned both SSD to their previous places. the windows SSD on the motherboard and the Linux SSD on the external M.2. I deleted windows from the motherboard SSD and started copying linux to the motherboard SSD using clonezilla. the copying was successful. then it gave the same reading error when i boot it up. I am not an expert in hardware but my theory is that the new SSD after using it on an external M.2. it installed for it self USB drivers instead of normal SSD drivers, resulting in the external SSD thinking it is a normal USB flash. I still did not find any fixes yet but soon I will legally copy windows from a random device to get one of the SSDs back to their sense. then reinstall linux while the SSD is in the laptop motherboard.\n    submitted by    /u/ParamedicDirect5832  \n [link]   [comments]",

And its colorful icons inform you of its major modes and states.\n As a bonus, it works for KDE+X11, too. I first developed pwr-tray back when (for me at least) KDE's power management was perpetually broken. This version is a qt5 app which may require some to install the qt5 foundation as a prerequisite.\n A unified power management app is quite the pain on Linux ... hence, pwr-tray on runs only on the few DEs/WMs I care to use.

          "description": "So, I switched from Windows to Linux in June. I was interested since before then, and CrowdStrike pretty much is the nail that close any desire of mine to reinstall Windows again. So I took my blank DVD, burn the Pop!_OS ISO and I install Linux into my ASUS X44H. In short, Pop 22.04 was great, definitely a great time for me. But then I have a GRUB error, and so I install my next distro: Arch\n So I follow this guide and I install Arch on my laptop. I love the fact that it's bleeding edge and AUR is definitely something that I wish all distro have. My only real issue was the GRUB error, which I managed to fix by... reinstall GRUB (Thanks, r/archlinux) and Wine. Unfortunately, Wine prefix creation doesn't seem to work on BTRFS and later when I use Arch again, I use ext4, and while that fix things, Wine still have problem that I am not willing to try and troubleshoot. Also, I use Wine to play Touhou, I can't exactly use any PC without playing Touhou anymore\n Finally, I use Mint, which works perfectly for me in everything that I use (minus AUR and Hyprland). It's just works out of the box. Ok, not really, I still have to setup zram and turn off several things, but afterward, it's all good. It's what I use now on my laptop\n Maybe when I get a new PC, I might multiboot Windows 11 LTSC (for Koikatu and every other game that I can't get to work on Linux. No game that use kernel level anti-cheat though), Mint, Arch and maybe Pop 24.04, whenever it's out\n    submitted by    /u/Okabe_Zero-Link  \n [link]   [comments]",

It's a Python CLI tool for Linux that helps organize your PDF files by giving them meaningful filenames. If you've ever had a folder full of cryptically named PDFs, this might be useful.\n Why I built it:\n As a business owner living in Germany, I deal with a ton of paperwork. Even in 2024, we get a ridiculous amount of letters. I use the GNOME scan app for digitizing documents, and it lets you run a script upon saving a file. So, I integrated pdf-namer into my workflow to automatically apply OCR and generate nice filenames.

Its a Python+GTK based macro recorder for on-the-fly macros on Wayland, because I had some repetitive workflows that I wanted to \"automate\". Its not fancy, its not complex - it just records your keystrokes and repeats them as often as you want. Thats it. Nothing else. \n I also added adjustable timing sliders, one for regular keystrokes and one for alt-tabbing from the macro recorder itself, so it catches special keystrokes and still allows to quickly execute regular typing. Works perfectly for me to quickly go through some Excel spreadsheets, or when logging my working hours in that stupid time tracking system we have.\n I didn't test it thoroughly and I'm sure theres a hundred ways to break it, and I'm sure theres some other useful features which could be added - PRs welcome!\n https://github.com/werzum/MacroRecorder/tree/main\n    submitted by    /u/werzum  \n [link]   [comments]",

I have, over the years, developed a strong hate for Microsoft. My friends think I am weird for talking so much about linux and trying to \"convert\" them. It really makes me sad when I see posts from people sometime moving away from linux. In particular, One of my closest friend which I had converted earlier switched back to windows for some personal reasons and it really strained our relations. I don't convert others now but it was a significant part of my personality earlier and still recommend linux when people ask me for any tech advice about windows.\n I wish I was trolling with the above paragraph but I don't know I feel like I think too much about my OS. Using linux somehow gives me a moral high ground as in I perceive microsoft to be an evil organization. Interacting with people on linux communities gives me a sense of accomplishment, as if I am doing something meaningful. I concern myself a lot with the rise of dark patterns everywhere and feel like I am a white knight to defend and promote linux (for example this post from my history discusses in depth about my concerns for linux)\n I am writing this post because I feel like this might be very unhealthy, and want to hear the opinion of the community.\n Tldr: Do i need to touch grass?\n Edit: English is not my first language, this is a serious post.

This is particularly useful because it eliminates the need to find the specific path to the EFI file, which can sometimes be tricky.\n How it works:\n GRUB lets you specify the root of the EFI partition where the OpenBSD bootloader resides.\n After setting the correct root, GRUB can simply exit, handing control back to UEFI.\n UEFI, which is already configured with the OpenBSD bootloader, will automatically boot OpenBSD.\n This method doesn’t change the boot order, and GRUB serves as a frontend, making UEFI boot the system without having to manually specify the EFI file path.\n GRUB Configuration: In your /etc/grub.d/40_custom file, add the following entry:\n menuentry \"OpenBSD\" { set root=(hd0,6) # Replace (hd0,6) with the correct partition for OpenBSD's EFI exit # Return to UEFI, which will boot OpenBSD }\n Explanation:\n set root=(hd0,6): This sets the root to the partition where the OpenBSD EFI loader is located. You should replace (hd0,6) with the actual partition that holds the OpenBSD EFI loader.\n exit: Instead of chainloading or directly booting the EFI file, this exits GRUB, returning control to the UEFI firmware. Since UEFI already knows how to boot OpenBSD from that partition, it will handle the boot process automatically.\n Benefits:\n You avoid the hassle of locating the exact EFI file path.\n GRUB becomes a simple interface for managing your boot options without having to configure complex boot paths.\n UEFI handles the actual booting, ensuring a more straightforward and error-free boot process.\n    submitted by    /u/Java_enjoyer07  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hi guys,\n If you look around, you will notice that many Linux distros, which are primarily aimed at “normal” desktop users, are based on Ubuntu. The most prominent examples here are probably Linux Mint, Pop!OS and Zorin OS.\n But why exactly is this the case? And why not use Fedora, for example, or, to give another example, OpenSuse? What makes Ubuntu better than the others?\n I did a bit of research into the differences between Fedora and Ubuntu and found the information that the packages in Fedora are more up-to-date and those in Ubuntu are often older or outdated. That would actually be a point in Fedora's favor.\n I have also had this experience. VirtualBox from the Ubuntu repositories is still on version 6.1 or so, the latest is now 7.0 or already 7.1 (I don't know exactly but definitely 7). And VirtualBox is the kind of software where you are forced to install it from there, because only then will it work. If you download it as a flatpak, you still have to set it up for the distro which is very complicated.\n Apart from that, you always find relatively different information about the two, such as that Fedora is supposed to be more stable than Ubuntu and has fewer bugs, whereas elsewhere you read that Fedora is supposed to be buggy. Then you read that Fedora is more complicated than Ubuntu, then somewhere else you read that both are equally simple. Just tons of information that somehow contradict each other.\n But there must be some reason why the people who wanted to bring out a new distribution thought they'd rather use Ubuntu as a basis than Fedora, for example.\n What exactly makes Ubuntu better than Fedora or other distributions? Or is Ubuntu actually not the best base for a distro and not worth the hype? What would be the best base then?\n    submitted by    /u/mi-wag  \n [link]   [comments]",

I'm not sure I have a complete understanding, but the article describes that when a syscall is issued, the following happens:\n  \nThe machine switches to kernel-mode\n \nThe instruction pointer jumps to the address of system_call, which is implemented in / arch / x86 / kernel / entry_64.S\n \nThe kernel executes the corresponding system call handler function specified by RAX\n \nThe result is saved to RAX and the kernel switches back to the user-space\n  \nMy main confusion is that in later versions of Linux, the arch/x86/kernel/entry_64.S file does not exist.

          "description": "Hey folks!\n I'm Xavier and a solo game dev since 2017. I use Godot, Inkscape, Blender and Krita. I'm used to this subreddit, and I like to read it! I'm more of a lurker usually, but as I'm making games I have to talk about my games, so I post quite often on reddit but here! Because I know you folks, I know you're not looking for some shiny stuff, but for something that respect your privacy, because I'm one of you using Librewolf on Debian for example.\n Anyway, my journey started in 2017, and my first game released in 2019, while the second one didn't went well. I'm about to release my third game (april 7th 2025).\n I have a spare laptop that runs windows for some testing, and a VM that runs MacOS just in case, but all of my computers run either Debian or Raspbian. I host my code on a raspberry pi using Gitea, and I share most of the code I write on github/gitlab. I also contribute to some tools that I use (godot and terraform for example).\n Today is a really big day to me since Steam accepted to put one of my game on their front-page. From a game that had around 5 to 20 players, it went to almost 600! Selling over 5000 copies within 24h. That's crazy and I really want to thank you all for making this happen!\n Of course I work my ass off to make it happen, but I don't have enough time to make an OS as solid as Linux. I don't have enough time to make a game engine as great as Godot. I don't have enough time to make a tool as AWESOME as Inkscape (I really love this one). I don't have enough time to make a 3D tool/VCE/... as incredible as Blender! I'm just talking about those tools, but I could have talked about Librewolf, KDEPlasma, Terminator, nano, ssh, git, gitea ... all of those tools/libs are great and I'm glad they exist.\n Anyway, I'm sure this post is going to get buried but I really wanted to thank you all for making all of this to happen.\n Ask me anything (if you're still here obviously)\n    submitted by    /u/binogure  \n [link]   [comments]",

I chose Zorin OS as it's the first distribution that comes to my mind (besides Pop!_OS) for people coming from Windows.\n The Moment\n I only configured general stuff (like Chrome, etc.) for her a couple of days ago, didn't get the time to give her a tour of the new setup with Zorin OS. Today, she told me over the phone that she had to install Visual Studio Code using a setup file she had lying around, but she managed to get it working, which is what shocked me. She still has no idea why I was impressed, but when she showed me around how she actually did it, I saw that it was literally a Windows setup EXE and it worked just as it does on Windows, without her realizing it usually doesn't work that way in Linux, at least natively.\n Look How Far We've Come!\n Newcomers to Linux may not realize how back in the day we had to set up Wine ourselves and yet things weren't as streamlined as it appears to be now. But still, this kind of \"backward compatibility\" in a Linux distribution, and that too out of the box such that a Windows user doesn't even face a hiccup clearly demonstrates how far we've come with Linux, even for a long-time Linux user like me. To say that I'm impressed would be an understatement! Meanwhile, I do not understand why Zorin OS receives all the hate, and to me, it hasn't received the love it deserves.\n PS: Sorry for the long post, but I had to get this out!\n    submitted by    /u/myTerminal_  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "The other day, I found myself reflecting on how far we've come from the early days when the only way to interact with a computer was through the command line. Nowadays, we have desktop environments, colorful and visually appealing applications, web apps, and social media. While it's impressive, I can't help but feel like the internet and computing in general have lost a bit of that 'wild west' charm.\n There's something fascinating, even mysterious, about interacting purely through text. It feels raw, direct, and oddly stimulating in a way that's very different from today's user-friendly graphical interfaces.\n So, I had this idea (though I haven't had the time to implement it yet due to work 😅): What if I stripped away all the modern graphical interfaces and returned to a fully command-line experience? Imagine surfing the web, talking to people, and interacting with the OS—all text-based, like the early days.\n Has anyone else experienced this feeling? Do any of you have experience living in this old-school, text-only world? Would love to hear your thoughts.\n    submitted by    /u/NonnoSi99  \n [link]   [comments]",

I've both seen people say you shouldn't expect Linux to be good for gaming, as that's not what it's meant for, and others who claim that it's very good with it. There's so much mixed messaging, and with a crowd that seems very ready to jump at one another, that's not a comfort. All this infighting feels like the history of China circa 1300s-1600s.\n I just wanted my taskbar on the left again ;-;\n On the user side it's been a pretty decent experience so far. The most difficult thing is that some settings seem very obscure or nonexistent (like telling a Wacom tablet to limit input to one window) - then terminal becomes necessary and online solutions don't work, so on\n But, when everything works, I am very much enjoying myself with Mint (w/ KDE Plasma). It just feels good.

Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) is then used to generate topic names for the contents in each category, resulting in the creation of corresponding folders names.

With this phenomenon in retrospect, I was wondering if Linux could be a better introduction to an advanced computer.\n Linux tends to be more secure against malware, can be made to resemble Windows superficially enough, and you can keep kids away from executing more dangerous commands with a sudo password. The compatibility issues with a lot of software can also be used against them trying to execute pirated games and the like, basically making it easier to control what they have access to.\n I know there are stories of how if you apply child protection time limits or website blocks they end up adapting and circumventing it...but if they do that with Linux, then they are also forced to learn how the system works well enough to familiarize themselves with programming knowledge which could help them in the future.\n    submitted by    /u/ChocodiIe  \n [link]   [comments]",

So, it's my third day back on Windows while I'm choosing my next distro and this is what I realized: modern Linux is drastically better than Windows in the user experience domain.\n  \nEven with flatpaks that are not designed to be fast and btrfs that is not built for speed either, apps load noticeably faster on Linux than on Windows. Tested on Firefox, LibreOffice, Gimp. Same SSD, different partitions.\n Incidentally, installing an app (LibreOffice again) on Linux does not require a reboot. I still can't believe that on Windows it does.\n Windows UI makes my eyes bleed and I can't do a thing about it without third party tools that are a can of worms in their own right. This especially applies to the taskbar.\n On Windows I can't switch the keyboard layout with one key like I do it on Linux. Since I do it hundreds of times every day, it's a problem.\n  \nI'll stop at this point to reiterate that no, we are not seeing things and not trying to convince ourselves of Linux advantages.

With how empty settings is, I just could not believe they would do something like that. It's complete horseshit with no purpose other than to make user experience worse. I have no idea why I was so attached to it or afraid to to switch over to linux. I think at the time, security was a worry for me (what will I do without windows defender?! oh dear!) but I can see now that's a total non-issue as long as you have a functioning brain and a firewall.\n It was a really difficult decision for me between Zorin and Mint, and Mint only won out last minute. Mint (cinnamon specifically) just does everything I want it to without any of the bloat. All my mainstay games are compatible with a little tweaking and effort. It's beautifully simple and customizable. I'm not being advertised to every five seconds. \n This is a sign: if you're a newbie, and you're sick of microsoft but too nervous to make the switch, just do it. Go with mint. It works great, and there's a massive community there to help you just in case you hit a bump in the road. You'll be glad you did it.\n Edit: I'm sorry I exaggerated about how positive my experience was. I was having fun. I don't understand what I did wrong to get comments like the ones I have but I'm sorry. I wasn't trying to \"jerk off\" the community.

Certain distros would crash less often, Windows would only crash at boot. But if you could get past the boot it would be fine. \n I cheaped out and brought a budget SSD from Amazon. I owned up to my mistake and brought a 990 Samsung 4TB. Installed Windows first, then tried NixOS for about an hour. Realizing I was way over my head - it's definitely a neat OS I'll probably try as a server OS, I installed Open Suse Leap again. \n I apologize to the Arch community here. I was warned by them it was probably a hardware issue about a month ago. However, I don't think I'm hardcore enough for a rolling distro as my daily driver.

          "description": "Hey everyone,\n IDK if you have the same problems, but I had an idea that might make screen sharing on Linux a lot more secure and private. Picture this: you’re sharing your screen on Discord, OBS, or any other screen share app, and you accidentally reveal something you didn’t mean to—like passwords or private files. It’s a common concern, and I think there might be a way to address it.\n What if we had a feature where you could easily mark parts of your screen as “sensitive,” and the compositor would automatically blur or hide those areas during screen sharing or recording? For example, you could set up certain regions or windows to be censored so that they don’t show up in the recording or stream.\n On top of that, we could take it a step further with machine learning. Imagine having a system that can automatically detect sensitive information—like passwords, IP addresses, or credit card numbers—and blur those parts in real-time. This way, you wouldn’t have to manually mark everything; the system could handle it based on common patterns.\n Does this sound useful to anyone else? I’d love to hear your thoughts or any ideas on how that could work.\n Looking forward to your feedback!\n    submitted by    /u/sporesirius  \n [link]   [comments]",

It might not be widely supported now, but that can change\n  \nIf I would give up any of these, it would the the fan. I could live with a fan if I can throttle the chips because computing power is not a strong requirement for me.\n TLDR: I need an awesome traveling computer as a replacement for the MBAir.

Some Pixel users in the US tell me they have Remote Lock but not the other two.\n  \nTheft Detection Lock uses a ML model to detect when someone snatches your phone from your hand and tries to run away with it on foot, by bike, or by car. If detected, your phone will automatically lock, blocking unwanted access to your apps and data. \n \nOffline Device Lock automatically locks your screen if a thief tries to keep your phone disconnected from the Internet for an extended period of time. \n \nRemote Lock lets you remotely lock your phone using just your phone number in case you can't sign into Find My Device using your Google account password.\n \n All three features entered beta in August, starting in Brazil. Google told me the final versions of these features would more widely roll out this year, and it seems the features have begun expanding.\n LMK which (if any) of these 3 new features you have!\n    submitted by    /u/MishaalRahman  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "As an iOS user who's looking to replace an aging iPhone 11 soon, I am seriously considering the Galaxy S24 and Pixel 9 Pro. However, one thing that gives me pause is the inefficiency of lock screen interactions on Android.\n On iPhones, you pick up the phone and see your highest priority notifications, then press any of them and you are directly taken to the app, as Face ID has already authenticated you. On Android, you have to first press the notification then move your finger to another part of the screen to authenticate. This can involve hand gymnastics on phones like the S24 Ultra.\n Furthermore, on iOS you can swipe right from the lock screen for additional widgets and swipe down to access Siri-suggested apps and a universal search box. On Android, you have to first authenticate with your fingerprint and then you're forcibly taken to the home screen and then pull down to access universal search (if you have enabled a GoodLock setting - god knows if Pixels can even do this).\n My decision would be so much easier if it were possible to not make Android take you to the home screen after authenticating.\n    submitted by    /u/continuous-function  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "So other day I had used my phone and kept it aside. But like it glitches sometimes, it thought I said \"Hey Google\" and launched gemini started listening to me. I ignored it and kept working, but then i noticed something strange, my phone got unlocked automatically, when gemini stopped listeing.\n I was shocked to see what had happened.\n I tried to reproduce this, and it is 100% of times working on my phone.\n There is some issue with the calculator app which come with the phone preinstalled. If it was the last app which you were using and locked the phone while using the app. The next time you say \"Hey google\" and the gemini launches, wait for it to stop (press back to spped it up), and the phone gets unlocked.\n    submitted by    /u/Pixel7_SecurityBugs  \n [link]   [comments]",

And since Google Wallet itself didn't provide its own QS tile until now, you'd need to manually open the app or add a lock screen shortcut (if possible).\n With the dedicated Google Wallet tile, though, you can open Wallet from any page. You'll need to authenticate to open it from the lock screen, though.\n This tile has rolled out to at least one user, but I don't see it yet on my devices. According to the \"what's new in Google System Updates\" page, you'll need Google Play Services v24.33 or later for this feature, though it seems to be rolling out as part of a server-side update.\n Thanks to Petro on Discord for the tip!\n    submitted by    /u/MishaalRahman  \n [link]   [comments]",

Here's a screenshot.\n Now, a FAB appears in the bottom right to open a new tab. Previously the button to open a new tab was located in the top left or behind the overflow menu in the top right, both of which might have been hard to reach.\n This change has been available for some people in beta/dev versions of Chrome for a few weeks now, but today is the first I'm seeing it in the stable version without any manual flag overrides.\n    submitted by    /u/MishaalRahman  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "能。\n我今天把 slippod 这个商业项目开源了，它就是没用任何框架，直接裸写 vanilla.js 跑的。虽然是个 electron 项目，但实际上和普通的前端开发区别不大。\n不用框架的好处就是我能够非常熟悉原生 js 的能力，以及能更好的学习 javascript 这门语言。在项目开发的过程中，我逐渐的学习到了很多 javascript 这门语言的细节，以及它和浏览器是怎样结合的。随着项目的进展，模块化变得越来越重要，也逐渐意识到 javascript 在 ES6 之前对模块化是多么不友好。\n现在的 vue 和 reactjs 做的最重要的事情也是让你用一种规范去写代码，规范中占比最大的可能也是代码模块化管理，以及对程序状态和状态之间的切换管理。还有就是与 HTML 结合。\n当初我也没有选用 jquery ，因为它是个非常具有时代特色的产物。在当年那个各家浏览器标准不同，接口不统一，jquery 实现的这一套是非常好用的。现代浏览器以及 ES6 之后的标准 javascript 让 jquery 变得没那么重要了。\n不过后续我打算把 stimulus 集成进来。现在项目写到这个状态模块化管理已经不太好了，stimulus 刚好能把前端的 html 以块状的形式组件化。它也没有做更多的 HTML 元素操作的工作，依然还需要我自己用 vanilla.js 去操纵元素，这也是我喜欢的点。\n我还用到了 GNU Makefile 这种古老的工具。它能让我把一些琐碎的工作用一条命令结合到一起（比如：压缩 js/css 再打包）。Makefile 也是一个时代特色的产物，它就是把 unix 下那一堆小工具结合到一起。还有就是当一条命令需要输太多参数时 Makefile 也能起到节省输入的作用。我认为 Makefile 最重要的特点就是它不隐藏任何流程，你做的任何事情都能在 Makefile 内容里面展现出来。\n项目地址在这里，欢迎各位 star 。\nhttps://github.com/leyafo/slippod",

          "description": "本人工作 5 年了，目前在银行做开发（大头兵），技术上和解决问题的能力上在互联网大厂里应该算不上大佬，但是在呆过的团队里感觉都能算的上是最好的那几个人，团队里的疑难问题基本都会找我。\n但是感觉自己情商不是很高，说话做事比较随性。举一个例子比如开会的时候或者有人找你干一件事情的时候，如果我感觉那件事情完全不靠谱或者合作的人很不靠谱，我就会很没耐心，毫不犹豫的拒绝或者敷衍的很明显，而且我加班也不算多，不是那种职场老黄牛。就我自己的认知来说感觉不是特别容易取得别人的信任。同时我也很好奇要怎么改变才能成为那种很快能取得别人信任的人。\n我好的地方在于一旦我接受了或者认可了某件事情我都还是很有责任心，会想尽一切办法让这件事情成功。我跟着我现在的领导也快两年了，帮领导做了挺多拿绩效的事情，领导对我也比较好给我对我比较认可，给了我很多次绩效上浮。但是领导总是不会让我负责具体的产品，只让我负责开发解决问题，每次都是安排他之前的下属做明面的负责人，哪怕是这个产品最早是我提出设计并且一路开发和跟进需求的，而且说实话那些人感觉根本就做不好。所以感觉内心有很多不平衡，不能自己去掌控产品的走向。但是转念又一想领导虽然技术和能力一般吧，但平时人真的很好（脾气特别好），绩效给我也不错，也给了我晋升，他之前的下属人也很好都是很有耐心很好说话的情商挺高的那种人。所以我现在很纠结，我是真的觉得他们来负责产品真的不会让这个产品更好，我明显比他们对产品有更好的理解而且技术上我也更擅长。（这里真的不是自夸）\n现在这样的安排让我有点心灰意冷，在想是不是工作敷衍下就行了，开始专注自己个人的事情了。\n想听听各位大佬的意见，我的问题在哪，该如何解决？我感觉马斯克和乔布斯（这两位是我的偶像）情商脾气也不是很好，但是他们也都干的很好？这样只在乎解决问题，缺少人情味的人不适合国内的职场环境吗？\n欢迎各位大佬一起探讨。",

          "description": "00. 写在前面\n大家好，我是大家的林语冰。\n前端工程中，苦于“前 CSS3 时代”相对落后的原生语法，CSS 架构一直是前端架构师的痛点之一。\n因此，我们一般会在项目里引入更先进的 CSS 框架或预处理器，比如国内比较火的 SCSS/LESS ，或者海外人气爆棚的 Tailwind CSS/UnoCSS 等。\n\n问题在于，当我们学习从原生 CSS 升级到 SCSS ，或者老板要求从 SCSS 迁移到人气更高的 Tailwind 框架时，不同 CSS 框架的学习成本也不容小觑。\n本质上而言，这些 CSS 框架提供的高级语法最终都会被转译为原生 CSS ，而这种语法转换工作恰恰是 AI 编程助手的拿手好戏。\n所以，本期我想分享如何利用 VSCode 和 MarsCode AI 插件，在原生 CSS 和不同 CSS 框架中无缝衔接，直接让 AI 解放我们的双手，不必再因为不同的 CSS 框架而头大。\n01. 前期准备\n本文的示例代码是用原生 CSS 实现一个仿真的 iPhone 手机，类似的产品模型网页预览效果在很多电商网站都比较常见，最终实现效果如下所示：\n\n上述手机模型对应的原生的 HTML 结构和 CSS 代码如下：\n（ PS：此处代码仅供参考，大家可以用自己的样式代码进行后续测试，不需要关注这里的代码细节）\n\n\n02. VSCode AI 插件\n假设上述示例是项目遗留的旧代码，我们想要使用其他 CSS 框架重构为可维护的高级样式代码，就需要和 AI 助手联动，让 AI 帮我们写代码。\n首先，我们需要可以使用手机号或邮箱注册一个账号，然后在 VSCode 里搜索和安装 MarsCode 扩展插件，登录后就可以在 VSCode 里直接使用 AI 编程助手。\n另外，豆包 MarsCode 使用的是字节跳动的国产大模型，所以我们不需要考虑科学上网等复杂问题。\n接着就可以让 AI 干活了，我们可以把原生 CSS 抽离到单独的样式文件中，然后让 AI 把它转译为 SCSS 版本，只需要通过聊天的方式命令 AI 执行任务即可，不需要我们手动敲一行代码。\n\nMarsCode 比较人性化的一点是，生成的代码可以直接一键保存到新文件中，然后我们可以测试生成的 SCSS 代码是否和原生版本等效，如果效果有偏差，可以尝试多生成几次。\n我这里生成的 SCSS 代码也可以正常工作，因为样式逻辑并不复杂，但所有原生 CSS 都被重构为 SCSS 的嵌套语法。\n毋庸置疑，在代码编译或重构方面，AI 可以明显提高我们的生产力，哪怕是复杂的样式代码也不例外。\n03. 样式构建\n目前前端工程中，大部分项目可能会依赖 Vite 工具链构建，因此我们也可以引入 Vite ，再集成需要的 CSS 框架。\nVite 配置在官方文档有具体介绍，以 SCSS 为例，我们需要安装模块，然后更改配置文档。\n\n实际测试中，我偷懒不看文档，而是直接询问 AI 助手如何配置，MarsCode 虽然给出了答案，但是答案未必有效，可能出现配置失败，或者配置生效，但不是最佳配置的情况，我猜可能跟目前 MarsCode 的预训练模型的局限性有关。\n这也说明和 AI 编程助手一起使用时，我们最好还是有对应 CSS 框架的知识储备，才能放心地偷懒，遇到 bug 也能了然于胸。\n另外，在 CSS 框架选型方面，目前我更推荐 UnoCSS ，因为它是一个同构引擎，这意味着，UnoCSS 默认兼容 Tailwind 同款语法，也能够支持类似 SCSS 的功能，更加通用。\n在 AI 生成代码过程中，不同 CSS 框架语法本身不会给 AI 带来太大负担，我们同样只需要通过对话，就能生成对应框架的代码。\n比如我让 MarsCode 生成的 UnoCSS/Tailwind 代码，也能一键实现相同的样式效果。\n\n高潮总结\nCSS 框架或预处理器的本质是提供了某些比原生 CSS 高级的语法，方便我们在前端工程中实现可维护的样式架构，但它们最终还是要编译为原生 CSS 。\n一般而言，在不同的 CSS 框架中迁移，我们需要重新学习和手动重构，AI 编程助手可以辅助我们一键迁移。\n在 VSCode 中，我们可以借助 MarsCode 插件，轻松地将原生 CSS 代码重构为不同 CSS 框架的代码，无需手动敲一行代码，这提高了我们的开发效率，但同时也要注意 AI 工具的局限性。\n目前 AI 无法淘汰程序员，但 AI 会淘汰不懂 AI 的程序员。你可以注册和安装 VSCode 插件，在 VSCode 中提前尝试 AIGC 时代的低代码编程方式。\nVSCode AI 助手插件的官方链接在这里分享给大家： https://www.marscode.cn/events/s/ikWsGYKj \n#豆包 MarsCode 双节创意征文话题 #豆包 MarsCode 放码过来",

Pro 系列 x5 的长焦过于极端\n\t日常生活中对长焦的期望就是拍拍 PPT/人像什么的，2x 足矣，3x 更好。只有出去旅游的时候可能会调用到 x5\n\t不清楚 iPhone 16 基础款裁切出来的画面如何，以及 iPhone 16 和 iPhone 16 Pro 在 2x-5x 中间这个区间表现是否有差异\n3. 有点馋 Pro 超窄的边框（但是我知道应该也就是最开始的时候有感知）\n4. 想接下来这部手机能用的久一点，所以就有点忌讳基础版/老款。（虽然这次基础款和 Pro 性能差异不大，而且内存大小一致，但是只有 Pro 有散热提升？）\n再等一年如何？\n我现在手机自身的状态挺好的，电池健康挺好，也没有硬件/外观问题，现在换掉感觉有点可惜了。\n我之前的手机寿命都比较久（上一部 iPhone X 5 年），也希望手机能用得久一点",

          "description": "大家好！👋\n最近在做亚马逊联盟营销的小伙伴们，应该都有一个共同的烦恼，那就是如何快速抓取大量商品信息，并且高效地导出推广链接用于 SEO 或者社媒推广。为了简化这个过程，我想给大家推荐一款刚发布不久的插件 —— Amazon Product Scraper ，这是我身边一个做独立站的朋友开发的，已经在实战中帮我们省了不少时间。\nhttps://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/amazon-product-scraper/ogfogfdkacdklhgpmgbmapeljcbibial?authuser=0&hl=en\n这款插件能解决什么问题？\n我们在做亚马逊联盟时，通常需要通过关键词搜索大量商品信息，然后一一点击商品页面，获取标题、价格、商品详情、图片链接，再手动生成推广链接。这种重复操作不仅耗时，而且非常枯燥，特别是当你需要抓取上万条商品数据的时候，手动操作几乎不可行。\n这款插件解决的正是这个痛点。它可以根据输入的关键词自动抓取亚马逊商品信息，包括：\n•\t商品标题\n•\t价格\n•\t商品详情\n•\t图片 URL\n•\t商品链接\n\n最棒的是，它还支持批量导出这些数据到 Excel 友好的 CSV 文件，并且允许你提前输入亚马逊联盟的推广 ID ，在导出商品链接时自动生成你的专属推广链接。\n插件的功能特点：\n1.\t关键词搜索：通过输入关键词，快速筛选相关商品。\n2.\t自动抓取数据：一键获取商品标题、价格、图片和详情，无需手动点击商品页面。\n3.\t推广链接生成：支持预先定义你的 Amazon Affiliate ID ，导出时自动添加到商品链接中，方便追踪佣金。\n4.\t数据导出：支持将抓取的数据导出为 CSV 文件，方便进行后续处理或分析。\n\n使用场景举例\n假设你有一个网站需要针对 1000 个关键词创建页面，每个页面需要 30-50 个商品推荐。那你就需要抓取 3-5 万条商品信息。手动完成这项工作不仅耗时，还容易出错。而这款插件可以让你快速自动化这个流程，几乎是拯救了无数时间。\n有兴趣的朋友可以去 Chrome Web Store 下载试试。如果大家有更好的建议，或者使用过程中的问题，欢迎在评论区讨论！🙏",

          "description": "淘宝新推出了选择主题功能，可以更改整个网站的风格和布局。\n这一功能的作用是为了满足用户的个性化需求。那么显然，淘宝做得非常失败。\n首先，需要知道的是个性化需求是存在的。\n第二，个性化需求在产品设计上有众多解决方案。\n常见的有：1.不提供解决方案（选择性忽视）。2.只提供有限的选项，比如亮色模式和暗色模式。3.提供定制服务。4.提供众多版本以满足用户不同的个性化需求，比如 QQ 秀。\n第三，淘宝选择了最差的解决方案，就是提供众多版本以满足个性化需求。\n为什么说这种是最差的方案，原因有以下几点：\n第一：永远无法满足每个人的个性化需求。\nQQ 秀有成百上千套，但每个人心中只想要独一无二的那一套。小到 QQ 秀，大到房屋装修，只要用户想要个性化，那必然的结果就是想要与众不同。\n所以要让每个用户都有个性化的感觉并不能通过更换几套主题就能实现。\n要实现这样的目标，可以参考的是产品是游戏的捏脸系统和 QQ 空间。这类产品的问题在于用户使用复杂。不仅开发它们的公司需要付出巨大成本，用户也需要付出巨大成本来使用。\n第二：个性主题的用户体验差。\n淘宝默认使用的主题就是最好的主题，不然为什么用做默认呢。所以其他主题都不会比默认的好，那么为什么要提供一堆二流主题让用户使用呢！这行为不等于降低产品的用户体验吗？\n作为对比，iPhone 16 提供多种颜色来满足个性化需求，但同一型号手机只在颜色上有区别，其他产品特征都一样。iOS 18 新增图标颜色更改功能，用较低的开发成本尽可能多的提供个性化选项，且使用此功能后能依旧保持和使用前一致的用户体验。\n所以，在提供个性化功能的同时需要保持一致的用户体验。而淘宝提供的主题则是完全不顾用户体验的，只强调个性化。有些主题的用户体验非常差，比如 Excel 。\n就好比在 5 星酒店里提供了 0 星房间供用户选择一样，是降级，不是个性化。\n第三：个性化功能应方便用户使用。\n虽然提供更为复杂的个性化功能能满足用户无尽的个性化需求，但复杂的功能本身会阻碍用户使用。\n这点上淘宝做了正确的选择，将个性化功能做成了一键切换，这在使用上是很方便的。但这个方便仅限在淘宝首页上，从首页进入到其他页面就找不到切换主题的按钮了。暂且把这个问题当作一个 bug 吧。\n所以在这一点上没什么好过多批评的，新功能难免会有 bug 嘛。\n总结：做满足个性化需求的产品解决方案本身没错，所有产品都需要考虑。但淘宝却选择了最差的解决方案。对于一个深耕互联网产品 20 多年的公司来说不应该犯这样的错。不仅互联网，几乎所有做产品 5 年以上的公司都不会犯这样的低级错误。\n房地产的精装房有个性改装选项。衣服有常规款和联名款。一个杯子为了满足个性化需求都会有不同的颜色供选择。这些都是成熟的个性化解决方案。\n还有更深度的满足个性化需求的方式，我们称之为定制。但定制不是在做产品，是在做服务。在做产品个性化解决方案之前我们就需要搞清楚我们是要做产品还是要做服务。显然这个问题对于淘宝的产品总监来说是很模糊的。\n简单点说就 2 点。\n在产品上做的任何事都要考虑成本和收益。不能做亏钱的事。\n做产品就不能抛开用户体验，即使是螺丝刀也要讲究用户体验。 所以好创意必须符合这两点，不然谈不上创意。 就好比放烟花，花了大钱的烟花不能只听个响，更不能只有一个人看到，不然就是亏钱。公司做事就不能亏钱。\n此外我的推断都基于一个简单的事实。\n就是如果非默认主题好，那为什么好的点没有用在默认主题上，让更多数用户用上更好的产品才是产品设计目标呀。 从这个点作为出发点，淘宝的产品要做的事情是迭代产品，优化产品设计，而不是推出更多不同风格和布局的主题。 所以不需要任何理性分析就能得出可靠的结论，默认主题是淘宝的产品和设计师觉得最好的设计，其他主题是为了满足用户的个性化需求而做。 但这么做显然既不能提升产品价值，也不能满足用户的个性化需求。 如果能满足个性化需求，那么个性主题的数量应是固定的。但事实是，选择主题下拉选择中有 16 个主题，主题的总数目前是 55 个。说明产品不确定哪些主题，多少主题能满足用户的个性化需求。所以，这是一个失败的尝试，产品将工作量转嫁到了用户身上。而用户更不能确定哪个个性化主题是最适合自己的。毕竟没多少用户会将 55 个主题全部尝试。这些工作量不应该让用户承担。 所以，这个点也是产品设计中不该犯的错！\n所以，是什么原因让淘宝犯了这些错呢？\n关于我\nUI/UX 设计师, 16 年设计经验, 先后工作于腾讯\\阿里, 现在创造 SnowUI.\nsnow.byewind.com \nfigma.com/@byewind\nTwitter / Instagram / Dribbble / Figma",

          "description": "我是自 12 年初就开始接触 Minecraft 服务器的一名老服主。转眼间，十多年的时光过去了，我想在这里和大家分享一下我的制作经历，并请教各位一些问题。\n2019 年，我大专在读期间，启动了一个名为“幻想地下城”的项目，这是一款以西方魔幻为题材的游戏。由于缺法经验，在制作过程中，我不免走了许多弯路。之所以选择这个项目，是因为当时网易代理 Minecraft ，流量充足，代理的游戏项目收益颇丰。一个好的项目，一个月甚至可以做到百万流水，对于我们几个人的小团队来说，相当可观。我们投入了大约 30 万的资金，希望能通过项目的上线快速回本。\n然而，由于缺乏游戏策划经验，我们在开发过程中经历了多次重做，这不仅消耗了团队的耐心，也让我们对项目的未来感到迷茫。2022 年，疫情结束后，我幸运地拿到了猪场的 Offer ，由于“幻想地下城”项目主要由我负责，最终不得不选择了放弃。\n在闲暇之余，我不断复盘制作过程中的问题，总结出了一些经验：在开始任何事情之前，我们必须清晰地知道自己要完成什么、实现什么、达到什么样的效果。遗憾的是，我们当时把大量的时间和精力投入到了游戏机制和功能的编写上，以至于连玩家的主线副本都未能完成。\n最近有了重新入坑的的念头。目前，我正在构思内容上的策划，希望有游戏行业的小伙伴可以给些项目建议。目前想做西游题材、或者是把之前的项目完成掉。之前的项目处于一个有一张主地图、需要在地图中编故事。这个还挺有意思的，有策划的大佬可以合作一把。\n之前的 Demo： https://docs.qq.com/doc/DRXNQWW5pakZGaU9l",

          "description": "2024,0930-1006\n我做了个梦：我的基金盈利 16 万，就想都卖了，结果基金 App 改版成了一个三国游戏，我费了好大劲才找到旧版操作基金的界面和入口……\nBleach 千年血战篇第三季出了，才知道 Bleach 动画开播也 20 周年了。\n国庆期间几乎每天都有饭局，暴食不断，涨了两斤，体脂率又要突破 30% 了。\n\n9 月数据总结\n下载量（极简时钟）\nApp Store ，增多 2.9%\nGoogle Play ，增多 10.31%\n国内安卓市场，减少 22.87%\n国内安卓市场在 9 月的下载量还不到 2W ，第一次跌破 2W 。\n收入\nApp Store ，增加 18%\nGoggle Play ，减少 4.17%\nAdmob ，增加 1.44%\n国内安卓市场，增加 6.74%\n我算了一下国内安卓市场各个 App 的收入比例，和 8 月对比，增多的大部分还都是极简时钟带来的，所以下载变少的同时收入变多，这一个月的付费率变高了。\n根据 RevenueCat 的最佳实践建议和其他开发者的实验结果，在 App 首次打开显示完 Onboarding 后就弹出 Paywall 会显著增加付费率。之前我很不理解，也不赞同，这在我第 43 篇周记里提到过。但是在 9 月中旬我也给极简时钟和极简日记这么做了，App Store 的收入也确实变多了。\nWWDC 设计视频\n最近 Apple Developer 在 Youtube 账号里连续放出了五个古早 WWDC 的视频，都是关于设计主题的。最早的一个是 WWDC14 的，已经是十年前的内容了。我看了其中 WWDC17 和 WWDC 18 的三个视频，那时候还是现场演讲，而不是近两年的录制好的视频，看到演讲者和 Keynote 之间的互动，非常怀念那时候 WWDC 的氛围（虽然我没有亲临现场过，以后估计也不会有了）。\n\nWWDC17: 60 秒完成原型设计\n演讲的核心就是：用 Keynote 画原型，然后通过 make ，show ，learn 三个步骤来不断迭代原型。\nWWDC17: 基本的设计原则\n这个演讲是通过一个度假的过程来介绍许多设计原则。\n通过机场的标识来介绍导航。\n通过开车来介绍反馈、视觉和一致性。\n通过酒店房间来介绍心智模型、亲密性、分组和映射。\n通过点餐来介绍可供性、渐进性展开和二八法则。\n通过潜水来介绍对称性。\n\nWWDC18: 优秀设计特征\n这个演讲非常的与众不同，即使是和同时期其他的 session 相比，也是非常独特的一个。这个演讲并不像其他 session 那样只是演讲者一个人在讲解内容，这个演讲是浓缩并精选了几十个小时对其他人的采访，将被采访者的回答用文字和音频的方式融入到了整个演讲中，而且最后还配合 Keynote 的各种动画，非常新颖。\n\n这个演讲分为四个方面，都是围绕“高品质”的，什么是高品质，高品质的重要性，如何获得高品质设计的启发，以及一些技巧和方法论。里面有一个观点是，App 应该足够简单，解决完用户的问题后就让用户放下手机，回归到真实生活。这不就是某个「小而美」 App 「用完即走」的设计理念么，但是它做到了吗？\n梦想中的键盘\n这周在二师兄的推荐下，终于买到了（几乎是）梦想中的键盘。\n我选的是复古白，自己配了金粉轴和一套苹果风的键帽，但是忘了键帽高度这回事，到手后发现很多功能键只能东拼西凑才能凑出一套键盘。\n我之前说我财务自由后就是想打造自己理想的键盘，无线+分体+可插拔的人体工学机械键盘，现在来看，这几点都实现了。而且这个还带有两个小显示屏，可以显示当前连接状态、所在层数、电池余量和打字速度。\n不过，还有一些不足之处：\n所有键帽都必须是 1U 的，很多功能键不好配键帽，而且我感觉拇指的键帽在 1.5U 以上才更舒服。\n键盘的倾斜角度是固定的，不能自由调节。\n没有手托，不过我在闲鱼上下单了一个，在路上了。\n最最麻烦的是，这个只支持 ZMK 刷固件，不能像 VIA 那样方便快捷地更改键位。\n\n不可能毫无用处\n黑猴三周目后感觉没什么可玩的了，正好最后生还者 Part 1 进入了二档会员库，就再玩一遍。第一遍是在 PS4 上玩的，通关后发现奖杯完成度连 30% 都不到，这次就立志一定要白金。这一次主线通关只花了 14 个小时，但是为了完成白金又花了三天逐章收集，终于白金了。",

          "description": "声明：我只有半年的炒股经验，分享出来，不喜勿喷，欢迎友好交流。\n接触原因：上盘年盘了下自己买的各种基金，才发现买基金是真韭菜。\n为什么呢？ 1. 除了买入费与管理费之外，频繁交易之下，潜在的卖出费用会吃掉大部分利润，而绝大部分基金需要频繁买卖才能盈利。2. 几乎所有的基金都没有分红，大部分看不出来究竟买了啥。3. 老鼠仓。\n遂决定去股市看看。\n一些心得：\n需要建立起对经济周期的认知，不同的经济周期有不同的投资选择。理清美元、美债/债券、黄金、股市他们之间的关系。有很多的宏观经济指标可以辅助判断经济周期。富途的 [一学就懂的宏观经济课] 挺不错，还有曼昆的 [经济学原理] —— 宏观经济学分册。\n美股可以整价值投资，A 股只适合投机，港股/中概股是比较优质的投机股。国内的股市是政(诈)策(骗)市，政府主导，在政策市下讨论哪个股票有价值是没有意义的，有意义的指标是共识——大家认为好才是真的好，自己认为好并不一定好。\n能看到的数据是意味着过去的情况，并不代表未来；自己需要需要结合当下的信息来给出未来一个预期；如果未来与预期不符需要及时修正。需要分清当前的市场在由基本面(政策、宏观数据、信息等)中的哪个指标来主导：在主导指标不变的情况下，前一段时间的股票在猛涨，当前在狂跌，则意味着买入机会。\n自己的预期需要结合别人的预期一起看。这个别人指的是：1. 经过历史验证了正确率的。2. 使用了真金白银去市场投票了的。3. 远离一分钱不出的口嗨党。\n大行情下不存在什么信息差，缺失的是自身的判断与下决定的勇气。学会反人性——勿追涨杀跌，面对猛跌的时候要么反思，要么有加仓的觉悟。\n要相信 gov 的底线是保持经济可以(而非正常)运转——这也不相信的话就没必要在这片土地上待了吧。穷人没饭吃要掀桌子，富人怎么都是赢，全球的 gov 都在押中产不敢掀桌子。\n根据风险偏好的不同使用适当的措施对冲风险。\n提供几个工具/方法辅助判断：\n美联储降息预测: https://www.cmegroup.com/markets/interest-rates/cme-fedwatch-tool.html\n长期期权/期货的价格还是比较稳定的，意味着大家未来对这个东西价值的预期。比如美元人民币汇率期货： https://sc.hkex.com.hk/TuniS/www.hkex.com.hk/Products/Listed-Derivatives/Foreign-Exchange/USD-CNH-Futures\n关于近期 A 股的走势观察：USD/CNH 实时汇率、北向资金流入、交易量、几个 ETF——FXI,KWEB,MCHI,ASHR\n股市里没有 100%的赢家，是根据已知信息去押大小。有的人喜欢高收益，看不上必赢的丁点收益，就去押小概率事件；有的人愿意牺牲流动性去搏低风险高收益…… 不同的人有不同的选择。找到合适的才是最好的。\n很多东西，不去尝试永远不知道行不行；经过事实检验的观点才是好的观点. 主观的事情，一千个人有一千个哈姆雷特，但是客观的事情只有一个哈姆雷特。如果你的观点经常与未来事实不符，要么通过反思自己来修正观点，要么放弃传播给他人，除非你本就怀有恶意. 万事无绝对，风险与收益并存，从来不存在低风险、高收益的东西。\n关于这几天的股市，我挺佩服上周一与周二加仓的人，上周一之前买入的人只是存在一个会涨起来的信念。\n让我更印象深刻的是中国人还是钱多、喜欢赚钱，哪里有钱赚就一窝蜂拥上去，完美符合普通人、有钱赚、不排队定律。\n上周的政策让我加深了对 [流动性] 这个词语的理解：能流通的才有流动性。中国人喜好储蓄，但储蓄就意味着货币流动性的缺失；宽松的货币政策与储蓄的理念相悖。换句话将就是：勤劳不会致富，储蓄使积攒的财富丢失。\n穷人储蓄不多，更在意的是是否有工作，没工作就没饭吃；富人可以钱生钱，宽松的货币政策会使他们的钱更多。钱生钱，本身就需要一个符合经济运行的对这个世界的认知，与自身的诸如勇气之类的品质。或许一个合格的社会保障体制是能够令所有人享受宽松货币政策与经济发展带来的收益吧，而不是强调储蓄与保险。\n风险、流动性、收益是不可能满足的三角。在资金量多的情况下，与其 all-in 一个股票，不妨考虑下配置债券与期权，通过期权撬动更高的收益，通过债券对冲风险。另一方面，或许鸵鸟政策符合人性，同样是杠杆，面对房子多数人愿意去加——房价下跌不挂牌就不知道下跌，股票下跌是实实在在能感受得到的。\n一个小小的建议：\n动荡的时期才令人印象深刻。有想法但无经验的人，观察也好，小投一笔也好（大投算了吧）——印象更为深刻，请利用这个时期建立起对这个世界经济的认识、对自己的认识，不要偏执，不要盲从……\n请尊重使用了真金白银投票了的人的看法，可以不赞同但建议思考一番；远离口嗨党",

          "description": "前情提要： https://www.v2ex.com/t/1024906\n这大半年我换了三份工作，目前是第四份工作。\n第一份工作是租 DoorDash 账号送外卖，扣除租金之后时薪大概在 16 左右，跟学校刷盘子的工资🈚️显著区别，只是工作内容相对轻松一些，对于我这种爱车人士很友好（我是那种可以连续开 14 个小时高速的人）。缺点就是极度费车，里程数上涨的太快了，导致保养之间的间隔极速缩短。刚开始几次保养还舍得买全合成机油，到后面就只舍得用最便宜的半合成了，到最后都不去店里换了，自己在家动手换。反正是廉价二手车，没有维保记录也无所谓了。\n第二份工作是给华人车行做销售，没有底薪只有提成，这也为后面的悲剧埋下了伏笔。第一个客户是一个学姐，但实际跟我对接的是她父亲，刚开始给他们找到了一台合适的车，他们也很爽快的签合同了，就差 title （车辆大本）寄到去过户了。结果就在等 title 的这一周内，车子出故障了。开去 4S 店做检查，技师说发动机被油泥糊满了，前任车主没有按规定做保养，是人为因素，不予保修。于是漫长的扯皮就开始了。一开始车行想让我隐瞒故障原因糊弄了事，但是客户又不是不懂英语，人家跟技师一聊就知道怎么回事啊😅然后车行答应给换车，这中间拖了大概 3 个周，新车才送到。然后车行又让我联系拖车把旧车拖走，还要求我把旧车的 title 送去 manheim 拍卖行（在美国卖二手车的 V 友应该很熟悉）。最后折腾了一个多月才尘埃落定，而我一共也才赚了 1000 美金😅车行原本保证我事成之后再给我 300 美金的辛苦费，结果最后也没给😅\n第二份工作吃了个大亏后就不跟他们合作了，开始找第三份工作。在华人 168 上找的一些招工帖，都挨个私信去问。最后有一个开餐厅的老板让我去做兼职，每周六周天的晚上去帮忙送餐。虽然也是送外卖，但是工资比 DoorDash 高的多，底薪 12 再额外加小费。到手大概 23 左右。可惜我当时经验不足，多管闲事，后来被开了。具体事情是：老板娘想找人换点人民币，我想起来学生群里有很多人换汇，然后就帮她联系了一个人。结果那个人是个骗子，他手上的钱有问题，人民币转给老板娘的第二天这笔钱就被冻结了，帽子叔叔说这笔钱涉及诈骗，目前正在调查，所以不让动。然而那个骗子已经拿着老板娘给的 2 万美金人间蒸发了。此事之后我就被开除了。\n第四份工作就是我现在做的工作了。因为我车子是 6 缸的，后面能挂 1.3 吨的拖车，所以我一直在学生群里接给人搬家的订单，机缘巧合之下认识了一个在本地开搬家公司的学长，一番寒暄之后发现是老乡，见了几次面还都挺聊得来的，他就邀请我去他公司上班。这份工作确实辛苦，但时薪显著高于其他兼职，起步就给到 20 美金，后面给到了 27 美金，还有额外的小费拿。再后来跟一个搞投资的朋友顺嘴提了一下，结果他很感兴趣，决定给我投一笔钱。跟学长商量之后决定转型做供应商（俗称包工头），又拉来另一个有美国国籍的朋友入股担任公司法人，然后招了一些工人就正式开业了。因为有公司的股权分红，所以现在每个周末差不多都能拿到 200 美金左右，时间短收入高，可以说是非常舒服了。后续如果这个小公司能活下去，那毕业之后会考虑找移民律师拿身份然后继续开下去，也很感激遇到了这么多贵人。\n总的来讲，不论在哪个国家，现在的就业形势都非常差，哪怕去做最底层的劳动者也可以说是朝不保夕，也不怪那么多人去送外卖。做过的这四份工里，除了最后的供应商，就只有送外卖是最稳定的了，收入低但是能养活自己，而且人际关系很单纯。\n如果有“二手车选购，找兼职，申请学校补助”等问题，欢迎加我的 V 咨询：BuildVirtual",

          "description": "背景：在 node 弱网环境下 axios 流式传输，网络带宽接近 0KB 的时候网络流（可读流）会触发 aborted ，从而使可写流触发 finish ，导致几十 MB 的文件只有几十 KB 。\n版本：node10 、axios0.19.0\n问题：\n关于 aborted 事件，看了 axios 的源码和 stream 源码，里面好像都没有定义 aborted 事件的定义，不知道它是哪来的（相关代码是我参考 gpt 写上的）\n服务端设置的 timeout 为 5 秒，客户端这边未设置 timeout ，因为 axios 中的 timeout 仅适用于响应超时，而不适用于连接超时，所以应该和 timeout 是无关的。我的理解是客户端收到响应成功后，会建立一个关于 node 流的网络连接，这个流会在内存中进行一些系统级的操作，但是这里的流在文件没下载完就关闭了，不知道是为什么，看来还是因为 aborted 事件，这就又回到了第一个问题上\n代码及打印：（删除相关敏感信息）\nconst writer = fsx.createWriteStream(file)\n\naxios\n  .get(url, {\n    responseType: 'stream',\n    ...options\n  })\n  .then((res) => {\n    res.data.pipe(writer)\n    writer.on('error', (err) => {\n      utils.log(`download error`, err)\n      reject(err)\n    })\n    writer.on('finish', (res) => {\n      utils.log(`download finish`, res)\n      resolve(res)\n    })\n    writer.on('close', (err) => {\n      utils.log(`download close`, err)\n    })\n    res.data.on('error', (err) => {\n      utils.log(`download error2`, err)\n    })\n    res.data.on('end', (err) => {\n      utils.log(`download end`, err)\n    })\n    res.data.on('aborted', (err) => {\n      utils.log(`download aborted`, err)\n    })\n    res.data.on('close', () => {\n      if (res.request.aborted) {\n        utils.log('download aborted')\n      } else {\n        utils.log('download completed')\n      }\n    })\n  })\n\n[info] download aborted undefined\n[info] download end undefined\n[info] download completed\n[info] download finish undefined\n[info] download close undefined",

(use a Phantom Type instead 😌)视频很短，讲的就是如何避免不同语义但是相同类型的实例进行比较，由此我第一次知道「 Phantom Types 」这个东西。\n搜了一下，原来几个知名的 Swift Blog 多年以前就都写过关于 Phantom Types 的文章了：\nSwift by Sundell ，# Phantom types in Swift\nSwift with Majid ，# Phantom types in Swift，# Building type-safe networking in Swift\nHacking with swift ，# How to use phantom types in Swift\n一直以来，我在自己的代码里很少使用 swift 的泛型，主要是自己认识水平不高，怕弄巧成拙。现在有了 AI 了，感觉可以大胆使用了。写代码的快乐很大程度上就来自于重构后的优雅啊！\n其他\n备案下来了，Nut Goals 在国区也上架了。\n读完了《蛤蟆先生去看心理医生》，顺便把相关的《人间游戏》和《人生脚本》加入了阅读清单。\n恢复户外步行，趁这个转瞬而逝的秋季。\n夜骑了一次 10 km 。",

          "description": "大家国庆快乐！我们有一套预生产环境的 k8s 集群，大概 15 个节点，master 有 3 台虚拟机，配置是 8c 16g ，内核是 3.10 的，平时内存使用率比较低，大概能用到不到 4g ，每台 etcd 数据目录也就几百 M ，但是目前这 3 个虚拟机用的虚拟化集群的存储性能非常差，导致大量 api-server 到 etcd 请求超时，iowait 也经常到 20-30 。目前没有更好的存储可以供我们使用（机械盘的共享存储），etcd 这边我在调了 ionice 后也没什么可优化的了，因此想分 2 到 3 个 g 的内存盘给 etcd 当存储盘用，然后再用 fsync+inotify 等工具实时将 etcd 写的内存盘的数据写回机械磁盘，也达到了异步双写的效果，而且只有 1 台宕机，只靠 etcd 的自己的机制只靠内存盘也能恢复回来（同时 down 2 台可能性非常低）。不知道大家觉得这个思路有啥弊端吗？谢谢！",

          "description": "使用 Ballast 文件解决 Docker 容器磁盘占满无法启动的问题\n背景\n在容器开发工作中，售卖算力容器是一个很常见的需求，不管是用 Docker 容器还是 K8s Pod\n交付。\n其中有一个问题是：我们提供给用户的容器默认是没有限制 / 目录的，虽然说这些都是临时文件，真正需要持久化的文件我们可以提供分布式存储，然后挂载到用户容器的某个目录。\n一个简单而有效的方式是使用 XFS 文件系统配合 --storage-opt 参数就能限制用户容器的 / 目录，也可以说是限制用户容器的系统盘大小。\n问题\n但是当用户长期使用一个容器，比如在容器里进行模型训练，会导致系统盘空间越来越小，当系统盘空间已经非常接近我们设置的大小时，例如限制系统盘大小为\n20Gi ，用户已经使用了 19.9999Gi ，这时候当用户 Stop 了容器（关机），再次 Restart/Start 容器（开机）时很可能会失败。\n报错信息如下：\nError response from daemon: mkdir /localData/docker/overlay2/7adae703b531d3e114cd171999e5502fe685e13835569b6f1d9fb31ab812773b/merged: disk quota exceeded \n\n这好像没什么好的解决办法，因为造成问题的原因是用户把容器当成了虚机来用，一般情况下我们也不会持久化用户容器的临时文件。\n但目前确实遇到了这个问题，所以和朋友一番讨论后，想出来了一个思路。\n实现思路\n前段时间研究了一下 Golang 控制 GC 频率的方法，其中使用的是 ballast ，就像下面代码中：\n初始化了一个生命周期贯穿整个 Go 应用的超大 Slice ，保证 GC 在 10G 的一倍时才被触发。\n详情参考这篇文章 性能优化 | Go Ballast 让内存控制更加丝滑\npackage main\n\nimport \"runtime\"\n\nfunc main() {\n\tballast := make([]byte, 10*1024*1024*1024) // 10G\n\n\t// do something\n\n\truntime.KeepAlive(ballast)\n}\n\n所以脑洞大开，我们能不能也用 ballast 的思想来为容器提供一个 ballast ，当容器磁盘不足时，我们手动减少这个 “压舱石”\n的大小，这样就能能保证容器关机后，再次重启时，不会因为磁盘不足，导致失败了。\n当然这样的操作是基于一个前提的，就是：\n无论如何都不应该删除用户容器里的任何东西，即使是日志或者垃圾文件。\n所以使用一个人畜无害的压舱石，可能是比较优雅的方式。\n坏处也很明显，就是用户可以删除这块压舱石，并且用户 df -h 看到的空间是和实际购买的不一样。\n具体实现\n用户开通容器时\n当用户开通一个容器，我们会限制用户容器的系统盘大小，比如说默认 20Gi\n的空间，但是通过程序开通容器时，我们使用 --storage-opt size 限制时会把系统盘大小设置为 20Gi + 5Gi ，5Gi 的文件作为一个\nballast （压舱石）存在于用户的容器中。\n当用户使用了 19.9Gi （实际情况下要比这个数字更接近 20Gi ） 的空间后，df -h 显示如下内容：\n$ df -h\nFilesystem                             Size    Used   \n/                                      25Gi    24.9Gi\n\n用户关机时\n重点在 Stop 时，如果说 Used 已经很接近 Size 了，那么我们就调整 ballast 的大小，保证用户容器正确启动。\n举个例子，当 Used 已经为 24.9Gi ，限制的大小为 25Gi ，我们 Stop 时，把 ballast 的大小减小 0.5Gi, 保证用户容器正确启动。\n源码地址\nballast-docker-container\n如果对你有帮助，请给我一个 Star ⭐️",

          "description": "目前根据各家自媒体的测试，以及我去 Apple store 进行的尝试，可以确认以下 2 个事实。\n1.国行 iPhone 可以在 Qi2 模式下，以 360khz 实现 25w 快充；\n2.国行 Apple Watch S10 ，兼容磁力快速充电器（ A2515 ），比国行特供充电器快，但是依旧无法实现快充；（本人也去 Apple Store 尝试过用自己的 S9 插到展示机的充电器上可以充电，说明目前展示台并非新款国行定制充电器，也侧面印证了国行 S10 可以使用非定制线进行充电）\n根据国家无线电频率划分规定，苹果做了如下措施应对：\n1.规定只限制发射端，不限制接收端，且 iPhone 支持有线充电方式，Qi1 充电的频率也符合国标，所以针对 iPhone ，苹果的处理简单粗暴，不上架新款 25w magsafe （不排除目前在售的 magsafe 会不会在将目前存量的销售完成后，也会调整为 7.5w 的 Qi 版），手机的充电模块不做任何调整；\n2.因为 Apple Watch 仅支持无线充电，且 Apple Watch 的 2 个充电频率均不在国标允许的范围（ 326.5 kHz & 1.778 MHz ），苹果不得已给国行做了特供版 Apple Watch 和特供版磁力充电器。\n以下为个人基于官网 info ，及上述自媒体对于 Apple Watch 的一点猜测：\n1.Apple Watch S7 开始支持快充，且增加了一个频率 1.778MHz ，推测 Apple Watch 的快充是工作在 1.778MHz 下；\n2.A2515 快速充电器兼容 S1 到 S6 的表，推测 A2515 也支持发射 2 个频率（ 326.5 kHz & 1.778 MHz ）；\n3.国行 Apple Watch S10 使用特供版充电器速度最慢，使用 A2515 稍快，但仍然达不到外版的充电速度。推测 Apple Watch 的线圈设计仅能同时支持 2 个频率。国行增加了一个新的符合国标的频率（可惜没找到国行相关参数的页面），同时为了保证更好的兼容性，保留了 326.5 kHz 的慢充频率，去掉了 1.778 MHz 的支持。\n所以在使用 A2515 等充电器的情况下，会以 326.5kHz 频率工作，充电速率倒退到 S6 ；如果用特供充电器，充电速率甚至不如 S6 。\n4.国行 A2515 仍在销售，但是根据国标要求，推测在销售完目前生产的，也会下架。\n参考资料：\n1.S9 info\nhttps://cdsassets.apple.com/live/6GJYWVAV/information/locale/en-gb/ma2159_apple-watch-s9-info.pdf\n2.S6 info\nhttps://cdsassets.apple.com/live/6GJYWVAV/information/locale/fi-fi/ma1955_apple-watch-s6-hermes-watchos7-info.pdf\n3.S10 info\nhttps://cdsassets.apple.com/live/6GJYWVAV/information/locale/ar-sa/apple-watch-s10-info.pdf",

          "description": "尊敬的 V2EX 朋友们：\n我的母亲被银行工作人员诱导购买了大量保险，导致其耗尽毕生积蓄和退休金。今年九月，家人才偶然发现这一情况，整理保单和家庭收入后，发现她仍需缴纳大额保费给银行，且可能存在 9 万元的资金缺口难以填补。\n浏览了社区类似经历的主题后，花了 9 天时间跟银行协商、跟监管部门投诉，希望能取回本金，解除合同。但银行一直不予正面回应，也不愿协助调查。感觉疲惫不堪，因此希望向各位有见识的朋友寻求帮助（必有酬谢）\n以下是事情的概要：\n事件经过\n妈妈 10 年前就开始买理财和保险了，银行经理推荐她买的都是些很抽象的产品（约等于年利率仅 0.6%的 5 年定期存款）。\n近些年银行经理可能感觉妈妈这只羊很好薅，于是诱导妈妈购买了多份高额保险，包括 5 份终身寿险、1 份年金险、多份长期保险（最长的 24 年到期）。这些产品收益低得搞笑；而且 10 年内想取回钱，不仅没有收益，反而损失很大。\n维权困境\n律师咨询：无果，保险合同有效。\n银行方面：请求其提供双录等关键证据，被无视。坚持要求已对银行产生心理阴影的妈妈去面谈。\n政府部门：都建议找 12378 。\n12378 投诉：投诉单（包括诉求）被原封不动地转交给银行，并且在前天就结案了。\n现状\n银行在 9 月 21 日就说“正在核查销售过程”，然后说“跟保险公司一直在沟通”，但至今没有告知任何进展、信息，也不给协商方案。\n跟银行询问了两次，问能不能在 12378 委托独立调解组织来调解，银行都不予理睬。\n银行反复要求妈妈去面谈。把授权委托书发给银行后（妈妈授权我全权处理），银行委婉地质疑之前的沟通是否反映妈妈的真实意愿（实际上是真实的），更加要求妈妈亲自去见面。但是看妈妈现在的状况，恐怕很容易被击垮、被忽悠。\n妈妈拿不出任何证据，被银行的人忽悠的时候没录音。\n今天银行说可以“推荐一个专业的银行业调解机构”，12378 上的调解机构他们又不认可，请问这样是有陷阱吗？\n恳请帮助\n面对银行的推诿和自身的无力，恳请 V2EX 的朋友们能够伸出援手：\n如果您有类似经历或了解相关法律法规，请不吝赐教，您的每一条建议都弥足珍贵。\n如果您知道如何有效维护自身权益，如何与银行进行交涉，也欢迎您慷慨分享您的经验。\n银行工作人员的可疑操作\n提供误导性信息，夸大收益。\n规避监管： 将口头宣传、付款和合同签署分开进行，只在合同签署时录音录像\n使用煽动性语言： 利用“存款没利息”、“内部人员都在买”、“产品即将下架”等话术，制造紧张气氛，迫使母亲决定。\n阻挠家人知情：暗示妈妈“不要麻烦子女”。\n混淆概念：将购买保险与存款简单类比，使妈妈误以为自己的行为跟将钱存进银行一样。\n代填虚假信息： 替妈妈在合同上代填年收入等信息，且明显高于实际情况。\n即使妈妈明确说会提前解除保险合同（“三五年内就要用钱”），仍然隐瞒提前解除保险合同可能产生的损失。\n酬谢\n有帮助的回复必点感谢\n如果这事能顺利解决，给 V2EX 朋友们奉上大红包\n万一还能拿到利息的话，一定跟妈妈商量，利息大头归朋友们",

OPPO 账号的隐私问题\n当用户注册并注销 OPPO 账号后，尽管系统会对部分信息进行处理，但当前注册的资料（如手机号）仍然可能与账号相关联。\n在某些情况下，虽然系统对敏感信息做了部分屏蔽处理，但通过其他手段，仍有可能获取到注销后账号的部分关键信息，带来隐私泄露的风险。\n\n2. vivo 账号的严重隐私风险\n如果用户忘记了 vivo 账号，只要掌握用户的身份信息，通过验证身份信息，vivo 系统会将用户的账号和手机号展示出来。\n尽管 vivo 系统会对手机号的中间四位进行隐藏，但这些信息通过社会工程学手段非常容易被获取。\n更严重的是，当重新输入 vivo 账号时，系统会直接显示用户的实名信息的前两个字母，这在某些实名制的场景下可能会带来安全隐患。\n\n3. 与厂商沟通的反馈\n针对此问题，我曾与 OPPO 客服沟通过，但目前该问题似乎仍然没有得到妥善的处理，风险依旧存在。\n目前只发现 OPPO vivo 存在一定风险，不知道其他手机厂商是否存在，说实话为什么现在手机厂商不会倾听用户的建议",

          "description": "事情是这样的：老程序员一名，因为想回老家发展（孩子出生了，不想跑太远），在老家找了一份工作。其实当时犹豫了挺久的，主要原因有以下几个：\n我觉得工作内容没有上一份好（上一份工作主要是 AIGC 相关的，目前这一份就是硬件相关的自动化测试。）\n薪资月薪比上一份降低了 3K ，但是年终多了几个月。\n主要是怕目前这份工作内容太坑，但是胜在可以 955 。\n在犹豫期间还拒绝过，但是对方居然在 base 上加钱了（虽然不多，就几百上千）。当时还觉得对方还挺有诚意了，就接了目前的这份工作的 offer 。\n几个月工作下来，虽然确实比上一份工作枯燥，就是写写自动化脚本啥的，也从来没有在这份工作上获得过成就感，组内的编程水平也明显感觉比较低。（可能就是老家跟一线城市确实有差距吧）但是胜在可以 955 ，每天准时下班，所以整体下来感觉还不错，以为就这样可以安定下来。但是戏剧般的事情就在这个时候发生了：我的+1 居然提了离职，然后我的手下也被炒了。我们整个组也就几个人，这样下来我负责的项目就剩下我一个在干了（原本是+1 ，我，我 1 个手下在干）。\n然后我还没请陪产假，打算准备请的，但是碰上他们的离职期了，需要交接，现在都不知道能不能休了，因为我休了项目就停摆了。\n除此之外，我感觉+2 定下来的目标不可能完成，且他不懂技术，且他的目标可以说是乱定的！！！我对这里也没有归属感，技术氛围也很那啥，连我自己都可以当技术领头羊那种。对我而言这份工作就是上下钟。现在回想起来，上一份工作还是很快乐的，很有成就感，但是买不起一线城市的房啊 T T\n所以，我该跑路吗？重新找一份自己认为工作内容可以的？还是先苟着然后看看自己早下班发展点兴趣/副业？ 有点迷茫，大家支支招，谢谢～\nP.S. 第一次发帖，不知道格式，也不知道是否表达得清楚，如果有什么疑问，大家问了我再补充哈，见谅。",

          "description": "先说一下本人情况，双非本 985 硕，本科期间对编程非常感兴趣，同时也拿了很多国家级比赛的一等奖，最后也成功保研到某 985 学校。研究生期间花了大概两年时间琢磨科研，最后因为某些原因最终放弃了在学术道路上继续前进，收获了一篇二区论文和若干竞赛奖项。\n我在本科和研究生期间一直有个大厂梦，也为此付出了极大的努力，最终在研究生期间如愿去了某不知名大厂实习了一段时间，实习期间最大的感受是，难道这就是我一直追寻的大厂吗？这段实习经历并不快乐，因为入职时正值组内动荡期，因此被领导和导师当做牛马使，很多时候得干到十点多才可以回家，周末也不愿意出去玩玩，只想宅在自己的小房间玩玩游戏，吃吃零食，看看动漫。\n实习结束后，导师问我愿不愿意转正，我想了很久还是拒绝了。拒绝的原因有很多，首先是我自认为不够聪明，身边的同事不仅比我更聪明而且能在工作上付出比我多太多的时间。其次是工作的内容不太喜欢，每天的任务就是写一些比较基础的业务代码，我们组的前景我觉得也不太明朗。最后就是感觉互联网已经过了那个野蛮生长的时期，我想要取得像我领导那样的成就基本上是不太可能了。当然还有一点就是感觉实习的这段时间里，我已经完全没有同事之外的社交了，整个人也长胖了七八斤，如果继续在互联网行业，感觉自己很难找到一个能相守一生的另一半(我真的有点恋爱脑)。\n因为十分恐惧秋招签的公司比实习时候还要离谱(当然还有个原因是懈怠了，实习结束在家休息了两个月)，于是觉得 all in 国企，希望能在国企里 wlb 。秋招期间投了数不清的国企与央企、最终选择了一个自认为还不错的企业，薪资水平基本上是在大厂转正后的 1/3 左右，不过基本上能保证 955 。\n目前已经在公司里干了快一个半月了，因为某些原因基本上都干的是些办公室的活，等这段时间过去，可能需要转型成项目经理，偶尔会带着一些外包同事干活，主要负责协调和监督。还有个比较出乎意料之外…",

          "description": "这个工具原本是我上个产品的补充功能，后来用的人越来越多，索性给它独立出来了。\n开发背景\n酷狗概念版和波点音乐一直都有组队领会员活动，达成组队可以领取若干天数的音乐会员。每月 2 期组队活动，可同时发起组队和加入组队，等于一个月可以领 4 次会员。但是活动限制每期组队成员不能与上期一致，导致用户需要到处拉人，这个工具就应运而生了。\n主要功能\n提供海量的队伍池，用户可随时加入正在进行中的组队\n支持提交组队链接，根据用户点击动作判断有效使用率\n用户规模\n截至今天：酷狗概念版达成队伍 5300 个，约 15000 人；波点音乐达成队伍 940 个，约 3700 人。\n关于推广\n我的上个产品目标用户是网易云使用者，并积累了一些用户。但后来我发现压根不是这么回事，两边 APP 的用户画像几乎对不上，导致我几发炮弹全打棉花上了。接着我依据画像数据的大致走向，判断豆瓣的用户群体比较符合目标。我尝试联系一些大组的管理并得到一些支持，使用量渐渐上来但依然没达到我的预期。\n没办法，要憋大了。\n我在开发这个工具前，就建立过比较完善的私域链路（公众号-企微-社群），其中社群运营约 2W 人。接着我开始有针对性的策划类似“种草有奖”活动，并招募一些人在 xhs 进行笔记海投。由于我的人几乎都是素人博主，第一波并不理想；后来我加班做了些笔记模板作为参考案例，曝光转化逐渐攀升。至少目前不用我去拉队伍，主动提交队伍的用户量足够支撑工具的正常运转。\n至此，我决定单独给这个工具拎出来取了个名字：饭团组队\n后续\n其实此工具还有一些可深挖的地方，比如：组队成功提醒、队长互组等；受当时思维的局限性未能考虑进来。加之我主要是做用户运营的，如果你看到我画的页面，就知道此人是个野生产品。站在我的角度，我更多的是考虑：如何短时间内利用需求去造势（当时有个平台组队活动做的很大）。因此该工具在进行代码生产的时候，我就提前筹备了公域-私域的链路转化工作，N 个运营策略，迭代再迭代。这也是开发老哥愿意不厌其烦的帮我搞定代码的原因之一。\n最后放上这个小工具，移动端访问效果要好些：饭团组队\n使用教程做了个海报，图太大就不贴了，可点此查看\n若有使用问题可留言或联系：ZHJpbmt0ZWE3Ng==\n最后，祝各位老哥的产品都能爆！",

          "description": "性格比较宅，这段时间工作又比较忙，基本上都是两点一线，也就很少出去玩了。\n这个周末终于空闲了一下，决定还是出去走走吧。在地图上随便看了看，决定去西山岛转转。一来它在苏州，距离上海并不远，开车两个小时就能到，二来看中它的与世隔绝，它是位于太湖中间的一个小岛，只有一条笔直的公路可以进岛。\n忙了一大段时间后，如果突然停下来，就会变得很空虚了，有一大段时间但不知所措。这时候就会怀疑自己，得到一些悲观的情绪。\n找地理上的与世隔绝，就是想暂时隐藏自己一下，自我暗示可以放松了，就像是一只鸵鸟，把头埋进沙子里。\n晚上 7 点多开车出发，全程都是高速，发现越是靠近苏州市区，路上的灯也就越亮，路况也就越好。\n下高速时，基本上就是进岛的路线了，有一条长长的笔直的公路，两边都是湖水，由于是深夜，所以两边都是黑漆漆的，但可以感觉到两边的宽阔，进岛公路也修的特别好，除了机动车道，还有栏杆围起来的非机动车道，还有一层是行人道。进到这条公路，一下子就变得特别的安静，大桥上三三两两的有人聚在一起，有的还摆好了烧烤架，有的则是架好了鱼竿，准备钓条大的。\n住的地方是一处自建房，装修的特别西式，大片的白色墙壁，门口还有一个小型的游泳池。到达目的地时，老板还在别处忙，一个老大爷（目测是老板的父亲吧）牵着一条是老大爷的拉布拉多（ 13 岁），拉布拉多性格温顺，对客人热烈欢迎，他那个大嘴巴，大舌头舔的我的手一手的口水，还有点黏糊糊的，弄的主人还有点不好意思了:快去厨房洗个手。\n早上 7 点起床了，决定先把今天的跑步任务完成，早上天气比较凉爽，马路上也没有什么车子，绕岛的周围小跑了 10 公里。周围就是太湖，一望无际，感觉就像是在海边跑步一样。我可能天生喜欢视野开阔的感觉，每天生活在城市里，钢筋水泥，摩天大楼组成的钢铁森林，很容易就从生理上觉得压抑和不适。在这种空旷的地方跑步，脚踩在土地上，跑完步，感觉手和脚都很暖和，心脏还在刚才的运动中一点一点的平缓，这时候很清晰的感觉到它的跳动，感觉自己确确实实的在活着。走累了，就站在湖边，对着湖打喊一声，在这里你可以肆意呐喊，内向人的福音，不会有人觉得你很奇怪。\n离开民宿后，我们驱车前往缥缈峰，《天龙八部》里天山童姥居住的地方就在缥缈峰，不知道是不是取材于此。其实它就是一个小山，一条山道直接从山脚通到山顶。站在山顶，可以俯瞰整个岛的全貌，如果天气比较好，可以看到太湖更远的地方。只可惜，今天天气不好，只能看到近处的湖面，波光粼粼，一道道波纹里藏着金光。\n接着是林屋洞，大热天的，山洞里很清凉，还有潺潺溪水。\n大概到下午四点多，眼看着岛的上空布满了一层厚厚的乌云，应该就是要下大雨了，就准备驱车离岛了。",

          "description": "APPLORE - 探索 App 图标设计的宝库\n大家好,我是一名设计师，现在算半个独立开发者。最近我花了一周的时间,开发了一个叫 APPLORE 的网站,专门用于探索和分析 App 图标设计。给大家介绍一下这个项目: APPLORE\n\n项目背景\n作为一个搞了 8 年的设计师,我一直对 App 图标 LOGO 的设计很感兴趣。每次浏览 App Store ,有很多好看的图标，但是也有很多辣眼睛的图标。如果有一个专门收集展示和分析好看的 App 图标的平台就好了。于是, APPLORE 的想法应运而生。\n开发过程\n整个开发过程大约花了一周时间。用 Next.js 作为主要框架, 借助 Cursor AI 的帮助快速编写代码。我不是专业的开发，所以我是完全借助 Cursor AI 帮我开发的这个项目\n主要功能\nAPPLORE 的核心功能包括:\n按类别、颜色或发布日期浏览 App 图标\n查看每个 App 的详细信息\n分析 App 图标的配色方案\n创建和管理自定义图标收藏\n强大的搜索功能\n提交新的 App 图标到数据库\n\n技术亮点\n在开发过程中,我特别关注了以下几个技术点:\n使用 R2 存储来高效管理大量图标文件\n实现了流畅的无限滚动加载\n采用响应式设计,确保在各种设备上的良好体验\n优化了图标加载速度,提供流畅的浏览体验\n未来计划\nAPPLORE 目前还处于初期阶段,我计划在未来添加更多功能,如:\n图标设计趋势分析\n图标风格筛选查看\n结语\n开发 APPLORE 对于一直做设计的人来说非常有趣。我希望这个工具能为设计师、开发者以及 App 爱好者们提供价值。欢迎大家访问 APPLORE 体验,也期待听到你们的反馈和建议!\n也可以在 twitter 上找到我",

          "description": "最近一年，在我身上发生了很多事情。最重要的莫过于和谈了一段时间的女朋友结婚了，也买房了。在这之后，各种一地鸡毛的事情也开始接踵而至。双方家庭内部乱七八糟矛盾、夫妻之间的矛盾、原生家庭和小家之间的矛盾、因为房贷而带来的对失业的恐惧….这一切让我感觉都非常地陌生，仿佛一年之前，这些都与我无关。而我的人生轨迹也在这一年被彻底地改变了。 \n最近也一直在想，人生的意义是什么？人为什么而活着？莫非人生来就是为了去读书的苦、在吃工作的苦、婚姻的苦和生离死别之苦吗？ \n让人窒息的原生家庭环境、每次吵架都歇斯底里日渐支离破碎的感情、 越来越糟糕的工作环境…感觉自己才 30 岁不到，就像已经死了一样，心里看不到一点光。有时候很鄙视自己像个生活的懦夫，只知道抱怨….可是我明明已经够努力了，为什么生活还是这么一团糟？ \n以前我很鄙夷那些轻生的人， 毕竟能有什么事情是能够超越死亡的？直到我亲身经历一些事情之后，我仿佛也能理解了。有时候他们可能也只是不愿再去遭受那些让他们感到痛苦的一切。毕竟让我再选一次，我也不会再选择出生、结婚、买房。",

          "description": "2024 ，0909-0915\n这个周记的标题一改再改，因为被拒的次数不断增加。\nGoogle Play 账户验证\n这周一次性通过了 Google Play 的身份验证和银行账户验证。\n之前听闻有的开发者卡在这里好久，提交各种资料就是不能通过。我也害怕这种事发生在我身上，好在没有。就是按照要求提交了身份证、水电费和银行流水，就直接通过验证了。\n\n虽然来自 GP 的收入一直在下降，但是也是目前收入的重要组成的一部分，占到美元收入的差不多四成左右。\n上周有人留言要买我的账号的 App ，向群友请教了一番，结果并不能卖多少钱，连一两特斯拉 Model Y 都不够。算了，还是别杀鸡取卵了。\nShipaton 第五周\n距离截止日期还剩 3 天。\n第五周生产力大爆发，一共完成了 56 个番茄钟，是最多的一周！\n\n因为马上就要到 deadline 了，为了能够顺利提交 App ，不得不又砍掉了一个 Jar Type 。剩余的工作就是 UI 调整，修复 bug ，加入动画和声效以提高交互性。设计师列了几十个 UI 调整事项，还好我很快就完成了大部分，一天发四五个 TestFlight 的 build ，只剩几项我认为比较费时就先搁置了。\nhttps://youtu.be/F12HzTVRrT0\n连续被拒 6 次\n终于，周五下午四点提交了第一版，没想到过了 30 个小时才进入审核。整个周六的精神状态都是心不在焉的，什么都干不进去，总在期待收到审核结果的邮件，然后意料之中地被拒了。第一次被拒的原因还好，只是元数据的问题，填补后顺便修复了一个小组件的问题第二次提交（周六晚上）。\n在等待审核的间隙，完善了 Ship-A-Ton 的各种资料，还第一次用 Rotato 录了一个演示视频。\nhttps://youtu.be/IRKSo2Txclc\n然而，第二次被拒就是周日下午了，直到午夜连着拒绝了五次……\n\n第二次被拒的原因：Paywall 页面里缺少付费后用户得到的功能或服务（我选择的这个 Revenue Cat Paywall 模板没有关于付费解锁内容的配置）。\n第三次和第四次被拒都是同样的原因：说是 Paywall 页面无法加载，影响用户付费体验。但我这个 Paywall 是 RevenueCat 提供的，加载过程不由我控制，RC 的建议就是如果一切配置没问题的话，那就是苹果审核环境导致的，没有其他办法，只能是一遍遍的重复提交。\n第五次被拒的原因：页面存在难以阅读的文字。其实就是 Onboarding 部分的大段文字颜色有些浅，而且在小屏幕的手机上会显示不全。\n第六次被拒的原因有三个：\n付费页面的按钮文案不符合要求，而我这还是借鉴了 Mobbin 发布的关于提高付费转化率的最佳实践。\n付费后遇到错误，我猜是因为 App 销售范围和订阅的销售范围不一致导致的，因为我还没有时间备案，所以第一版就不打算在国内上架了。虽然 App 销售范围去掉了中国大陆，但是订阅的销售范围还是所有国家和地区，这里不一致，另外我也回复给审核人员说这个 App 不在中国大陆销售，请用其他国家的配置环境来审核。\n技术支持 URL 留的网址不符合要求，我本以为用 Notion 搭一个包含隐私政策和使用协议的简单页面就可以了，但是苹果说必须要是能和开发者直接联系的网站才行。\n第七次提交后就马上是午夜十二点了，心情已经麻木和崩溃了，十分沮丧和忐忑地入睡了。我还梦见了第七次被拒，审核员还给我发了一封巨长巨长的邮件，里面罗列了各种素材和命名的截图，说我的 App 抄袭黑神话·悟空……\n还好，没有第七次被拒，一觉醒来，审核通过了！\n我偏要贪图完满，搜个干净\n黑神话·悟空，二周目，白金达成。\n这游戏白金的达成，不是能力问题，也不是时间问题，而是运气问题。\n花了两天在收集各种概率掉落的物品上，感觉我人品还不错，并没有刷到崩溃就收集全了，不过就凭这一点也应该给这个游戏减 0.1 分。",

          "description": "9月25日，暴雪娱乐旗下知名卡牌游戏《炉石传说》正式重启国服，游戏预约人数目前已突破500万人。开服当天，由于游戏服务器登录、游戏排队等问题，“炉石传说进不去”“炉石围城”等话题登上微博热搜。\n\r\n\r\n大量玩家反应，通过暴雪战网登录《炉石传说》后，会有10至15分钟的等待登入时间，登陆时还出现了报错退出等问题，进入游戏后，会有10-20分钟内无法正常匹配玩家开玩。由于游戏服务器登录、游戏排队等问题，有新浪网友发微博称：“外面的人进不去，里面的人匹不到人，这就是炉石围城！”。同时，“炉石围城”“炉石传说进不去”等话题也登上微博热搜。\n\r\n\r\n对此，炉石传说官方微博发文回应表示：“开服至今，《炉石传说》仍然存在许多影响您正常流畅游玩的问题。您可能会遇到排队与匹配时长异常、无法进入商城、游戏中掉线等问题。事实上，目前国服真的遇到了非常棘手且繁杂的问题。在过去的近40个小时中，暴雪的技术团队一直在对问题进行修复，国服团队也不断进行着技术配合与问题反馈。除了炉石开发团队与战网技术团队外，已经有更多团队加入到技术支援之中。截止公告成文时，问题正在逐步解决，但非常抱歉，技术团队仍无法给出预期完全修复的时间。”\n\r\n\r\n以下是回应全文：\n\r\n\r\n\r\n关于当前《炉石传说》相关游戏问题的公告\n\r\n\r\n亲爱的炉石传说玩家们：\n\r\n\r\n对不起。\n\r\n\r\n开服至今，《炉石传说》仍然存在许多影响您正常流畅游玩的问题。您可能会遇到排队与匹配时长异常、无法进入商城、游戏中掉线等问题。\n\r\n\r\n事实上，目前国服真的遇到了非常棘手且繁杂的问题。在过去的近40个小时中，暴雪的技术团队一直在对问题进行修复，国服团队也不断进行着技术配合与问题反馈。除了炉石开发团队与战网技术团队外，已经有更多团队加入到技术支援之中。截止公告成文时，问题正在逐步解决，但非常抱歉，技术团队仍无法给出预期完全修复的时间。\n\r\n\r\n在本次国服重启的过程中，炉石开发团队在保证补偿发放的同时，尽可能减少了对系统进行修改并进行了相应的测试。但实际上线时，大量补偿发放仍然产生了一些问题。在国服缺席的版本中暗藏着许多只有玩家数达到国服量级时才会出现的BUG，这些BUG的集中爆发更加剧了当前的情况。当前不佳的游戏体验并非由于国服的服务器配置与硬件投入不够，排队也并非服务器容量限制导致。\n\r\n\r\n为了表达我们的歉意，我们将为所有玩家送上【5包“胜地历险记”卡包+5包“威兹班的工坊”卡包】作为补偿。为了避免更多不稳定因素，我们将在服务器稳定后发放这些补偿。\n\r\n\r\n同时，我们希望在此对一些误解做出解释，恳请您的理解。\n\r\n\r\n1. 这是网易故意的，排队是假的，就是不想让玩家进入游戏\n\r\n\r\n非常抱歉，游戏体验的不佳让您萌生了这样的误解。我们没有任何理由主动拒绝玩家进入游戏。事实上，因为游戏存在问题，我们取消了大量广告资源，压低了整体热度，避免更多玩家遭遇不佳的游戏体验。我们也看到玩家发布的带有技术论据的文章，这些文章描述的现象大多数是事实，但导致这些现象的原因是各种BUG而非人为。\n\r\n\r\n您的任何反馈都很重要。我们已经将各种玩家言论原文翻译反馈暴雪，希望可以让技术团队更好地理解国服玩家焦急的心情，保证团队可以更积极地应对目前的情况。\n\r\n\r\n2. App Store搜索不到《炉石传说》\n\r\n\r\n由于在过去一年中游戏下架，在App Store中搜索“炉石传说”关键词的点击都被引入了其他应用，导致根据算法《炉石传说》在昨日不在搜索结果前排。目前随着正常点击的覆盖与相关优化的执行，您已经可以正常搜索到游戏了。\n\r\n\r\n3. 主播可以正常进入\n\r\n\r\n我们并未识别这些玩家，同时暴雪游戏也没有插队等特权功能。请您理性看待这些言论。\n\r\n\r\n4. 某某模式没有人玩了，所以匹配时间过长。\n\r\n\r\n请玩家们理解，目前匹配时间过长是由于BUG导致的，无法反应正常的游戏情况。\n\r\n\r\n最后，我们对目前的糟糕体验再次致歉，期望在服务器稳定后再给我们一次机会与您在酒馆中愉快游戏。",

          "description": "近日，黎巴嫩数千台寻呼机和对讲机被远程引爆事件发生后，国外和国内流传一段苹果手机也被远程引爆的视频，引发网友担忧。\n\r\n\r\n经核实发现，该视频被张冠李戴，网传视频来自10多年前，美国一个民间科技爱好者的账号。该账号当时是制作的一个高压脉冲发生器，这种设备可以通过高压电流对物体造成破坏。博主会应网友要求拿手机等物品在这台设备上进行破坏试验，其中就包含苹果手机，且当时使用的是第一代的苹果手机。现在流传的苹果手机被引爆的视频，是被自媒体账号断章取义地裁剪了。\n\r\n\r\n据悉，在我们国家正规渠道售卖的国行苹果手机，是要经过相关部门的多道检查和审批才可以上市的。\n\r\n\r\n该谣言的源头是黎巴嫩近期发生的通信设备爆炸事件。在黎巴嫩多地发生寻呼机和对讲机爆炸后，网络上迅速流传出一段据称苹果手机也被远程引爆的视频。然而，这段视频实际上是被自媒体账号断章取义地裁剪自10多年前美国一个民间科技爱好者的账号。当时，该博主使用高压脉冲发生器对包括第一代苹果手机在内的多种电子设备进行了破坏试验，而非真正的远程引爆。\n\r\n\r\n与谣言形成鲜明对比的是，iPhone 16 Pro在电池设计上的创新与安全性。有博主对iPhone 16 Pro进行了拆机，发现其电池采用了钢制外壳，这一设计在行业内尚属少见。钢壳电池相比传统的铝塑膜软包电池，具有更高的表面硬度和更好的电芯保护程度，同时还具备一定的散热改善效果。\n\r\n\r\n拆解过程中，博主发现电池保护板位置设有泄压阀，这一设计有助于提升电池的安全性。此外，iPhone 16 Pro的电池重量比上代重了7.1g，容量达到了3582mAh，相比上代增加了308mAh。制造商为国产惠州德赛电池，采用ATL电芯。内部电芯基本填满整个空间，能量密度达到了764Wh/L，比上一代有显著提升。\n\r\n\r\n来源：综合环球网、中关村在线",
