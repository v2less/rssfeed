          "description": "Hello HN!  First a quick background of what I am trying to search.\nIn 1983, Logo Computer Systems, Inc. (LCSI) published two popular versions of Logo.  One was meant to be run on Atari systems and the other was meant to be run on IBM PCs.\nThe manuals and documentation for the Atari LCSI Logo are very well archived on the world wide web.  The two I am particularly interested in are here:\nA) Atari Logo Reference Manual: https://atariwiki.org/wiki/attach/Logo/Atari%20LOGO%20Reference%20Manual.pdf\nB) Atari Logo Introduction to Programming Through Turtle Graphics: https://atariwiki.org/wiki/attach/Logo/Atari%20LOGO%20Introduction%20To%20Programing%20Through%20Turtle%20Graphics%20%281-sided%29.pdf\nOn page 3 of the first document (9th page in the PDF), there is a reference to the second document:\n> First time Logo users should start with the companion manual Introduction to Programming Through Turtle Graphics.\nHowever, sadly, the manuals for IBM LCSI Logo does not seem to be easily available.  I found the following:\nC) IBM Personal Computer Logo Reference: https://archive.org/download/ibm_logo_manual/ibm_logo_manual.pdf\nIt too has a reference to an introductory documentation:\n> The purpose of the IBM Personal Computer Logo Reference is to give you a thorough understanding of the many features of Logo by expanding the information contained in Logo: Programming with Turtle Graphics, which comes with IBM Personal Computer Logo.\nHowever, I have not been able to find a copy of this document anywhere.  Do you know any place I can get hold of a copy of the document titled \"Logo: Programming with Turtle Graphics\" that is meant to be used with IBM/LCSI PC Logo?\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40691792\nPoints: 26\n# Comments: 4",

          "description": "Hey HN! Arjun and Zara here - cofounders of Overwatch (https://www.overwatchdata.ai), a platform to automate OSINT and threat intel, turning it into actionable insights.  Check out our clickthrough demo here: https://app.storylane.io/share/qyayvtamapis.\nOverwatch began when we were working with risk and threat intel teams at Google, Stripe, and government. We experienced the immense challenge every fraud and cyber threat analyst faces: manually parsing through an ocean of data to find valuable insights and filter out the noise. This included using many of the feeds and tools out there that were often very expensive, noisy, keyword-based, and lacked accurate entity extraction or advanced query features.\nMost threat intelligence tools utilize thousands of keywords and teams of analysts to ma…",

          "description": "We'd love to share our work with you: Restate, a system for workflows-as-code (durable execution). With SDKs in JS/Java/Kotlin and a lightweight runtime built in Rust/Tokio.\nhttps://github.com/restatedev/\nhttps://restate.dev/\nIt is free and open, SDKs are MIT-licensed, runtime permissive BSL (basically just the minimal Amazon defense).\nWe worked on that for a bit over a year. A few points I think are worth mentioning:\n- Restate's runtime is a single binary, self-contained, no dependencies aside from a durable disk. It contains basically a lightweight integrated version of a durable log, workflow state machine, state storage, etc. That makes it very compact and easy to run both on a laptop and a server.\n- Restate implements durable execution not only for workflows, but the core building block is durable RPC handlers (or event handler). It adds a few concepts on top of durable execution, like virtual objects (turn RPC handlers into virtual actors), durable communication, and durable promises. Here are more details: https://restate.dev/programming-model\n- Core design goal for APIs was to keep a familiar style. An app developer should look at Restate examples and say \"hey, that looks quite familiar\". You can let us know if that worked out.\n- Basically every operation (handler invocation, step, ...) goes through a consensus layer, for a high degree of resilience and consistency.\n- The lightweight log-centric architecture gives Restate still good latencies: For example around 50ms roundtrip (invoke to result) for a 3-step durable workflow handler (Restate on EBS with fsync for every step).\nWe'd love to hear what you think of it!\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40659160\nPoints: 125\n# Comments: 100",

Francois Chollet and I are launching ARC Prize, a public competition to beat and open-source the solution to the ARC-AGI eval.\nARC-AGI is (to our knowledge) the only eval which measures AGI: a system that can efficiently acquire new skill and solve novel, open-ended problems. Most AI evals measure skill directly vs the acquisition of new skill.\nFrancois created the eval in 2019, SOTA was 20% at inception, SOTA today is only 34%. Humans score 85-100%. 300 teams attempted ARC-AGI last year and several bigger labs have attempted it.\nWhile most other skill-based evals have rapidly saturated to human-level, ARC-AGI was designed to resist “memorization” techniques (eg. LLMs)\nSolving ARC-AGI tasks is quite easy for humans (even children) but impossible for modern AI. You can…",

          "description": "Hey HN,\nAs a Software Engineer, I frequently copy and paste content. The fact that macOS clipboard buffer can keep only one item is very frustrating. It’s very annoying to copy → switch app → paste → switch app → copy → switch app → paste, and so on. Losing items I copied hours ago and having to find and copy them again is a waste of time.\nI tried many third-party clipboard managers like Alfred, Raycast, Paste, Maccy, etc. While great, they didn't fully meet my needs.\nAs a developer, my requirements are:\n1. Keyboard-centric operation to avoid using the mouse. I don’t want to waste my time moving my hands from the keyboard.\n2. Display many clipboard history items at once. I don’t like the idea with big tiles, so I can see only 5-7 history items on my 32” monitor.\n3. Full content preview for each clipboard item.\n4. Quick search functionality.\nSo, I created ClipBook for my own use. After months of development, daily use, and positive feedback from my colleagues, I decided to share it publicly. It’s free. All data is securely stored on your computer. I’m planning to make it open source as well.\nIf you try it out, please let me know if you found it useful, if you have anything you’d like me to add, or if you have any other feedback.\nHappy to answer any questions. Much appreciated.\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40648404\nPoints: 36\n# Comments: 21",

We’re building Revideo (https://github.com/redotvideo/revideo), an open source framework for programmatic video editing.\nRevideo lets you create video templates in Typescript and render them with dynamic inputs through an API. It also comes with a  component that lets you preview your projects in the browser and integrate video editing functionality into web apps.\nThe project is useful for anyone who wants to build apps that automate certain video editing tasks. A lot of companies in the space build their own custom stack for this, like Opus (https://www.opus.pro/), which automatically creates highlight videos from podcasts, or Clueso (https://www.clueso.io/), which lets you create stutter-free product walkthroughs with AI voiceovers.\nRevideo is based on the HTML Canvas API and is …",

          "description": "Hey HN, we're building Thread (https://thread.dev/) an open-source Jupyter Notebook that has a bunch of AI features built in. The easiest way to think of Thread is if the chat interface of OpenAI code interpreter was fused into a Jupyter Notebook development environment where you could still edit code or re-run cells. To check it out, you can see a video demo here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jq1_eoO6w-c\nWe initially got the idea when building Vizly (https://vizly.fyi/) a tool that lets non-technical users ask questions from their data. While Vizly is powerful at performing data transformations, as engineers, we often felt that natural language didn't give us enough freedom to edit the code that was generated or to explore the data further for ourselves. That is what gave us the inspiration to start Thread.\nWe made Thread a pip package (`pip install thread-dev`) because we wanted to make Thread as easily accessible as possible. While there are a lot of notebooks that improve on the notebook development experience, they are often cloud hosted tools that are hard to access as an individual contributor unless your company has signed an enterprise agreement.\nWith Thread, we are hoping to bring the power of LLMs to the local notebook development environment while blending the editing experience that you can get in a cloud hosted notebook. We have many ideas on the roadmap but instead of building in a vacuum (which we have made the mistake of before) our hope was to get some initial feedback to see if others are as interested in a tool like this as we are.\nWould love to hear your feedback and see what you think!\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40633773\nPoints: 75\n# Comments: 28",

Like the mature version of Webtoon.\nYou can see two comics episodes at https://create.shortbread.ai/viewer/3d25370c-a4eb-4df4-af8e-... https://create.shortbread.ai/viewer/866c2873-9962-4ebe-8f0c-..., and read more in the app via https://www.shortbreadapp.com/.\nAll comics in the app are made by artists using the Shortbread AI Comics Studio (https://shortbread.ai). It is a powerful Photoshop-like editor that speeds up comic creation 10x with AI. The editor provides consistency and granular artistic control.

          "description": "A bit more context - the cloth sim is part of my app, Lungy (https://www.lungy.app). It's designed to be an active meditation / relaxation app, so you can play relaxing instruments in space and immersive breathing exercises. The original Lungy is a breathing app available for iOS, that uses real-time breathing with interactive visuals.\nThe cloth sim is a Verlet integration, running on a regular grid. For now, I have tried a couple of different cloth scenes - a sort of touch reactive 'pad', where different parts of the cloth are mapped to different sounds and a cloth that blows in sync with breathing. The collision detection is a little bit tricky with the deforming mesh, but seems to work ok overall. Overall, it seems like a cool interaction to explore.\nThe cloth sim is live on the app store now (and free) - would love to hear feedback from anyone with a Vision Pro.\nApp Store (Vision Pro): https://apps.apple.com/app/id6470201263\nLungy, original for iOS - https://apps.apple.com/app/id1545223887\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40539800\nPoints: 30\n# Comments: 17",

Fair enough, there are some sketchy dating apps out there, but we are much closer to Tinder/Bumble/etc. (albeit smaller) than to the mail order bride / escort service end of the spectrum.

          "description": "This is a MVP for Serverless Postgres.\n1/ It uses Fly.io[0], which can automatically pause your database after all connections are released (and start it again when new connections join).\n2/ It uses Oriole[1], a Postgres extension with experimental support for S3 / Decoupled Storage[2].\n3/ It uses Tigris[3], Globally Distributed S3-Compatible Object Storage. Oriole will automatically backup the data to Tigris using background workers.\nI wouldn't recommend using this in production, but I think it's in a good spot to provoke some discussion and ideas. You can get it running on your own machine with the steps provided - connecting to a remote Tigris bucket (can also be an AWS S3 bucket).\n[0] https://fly.io\n[1] https://www.orioledb.com/\n[2] Oriole Experiemental s3: https://www.orioledb.com/docs/usage/decoupled-storage\n[3] Tigris: https://www.tigrisdata.com/\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40514089\nPoints: 65\n# Comments: 17",

If you've got suggestions, give them even if you aren't 100% sure.\nThe brevity part is seemingly completely ignored. The lecturing part is hit or miss.

          "description": "Hi HN, I’m excited to share Spot, a simple, cross-platform, React-like GUI library for Go. It is just a few days old and has lots of missing features but I'm happy with the results so far, and looking for some design feedback.\nSpot is designed to be easy to use and provide a consistent API across different platforms (mainly Mac & Linux). It’s inspired by React, but written in Go, aiming to combine the best of both worlds: the easy tooling & performance of Go with a modern, reactive approach to UI development.\nKey features:\n- Cross-platform: Leveraging FLTK[1] & Cocoa[2], Spot works on Mac, Linux, and the BSDs with plans for native Windows support in the future.\n- Reactive UI: Adopts a React-like model for building UIs, making it intuitive for those familiar with reactive frameworks.\n- Traditional, native widget set: Utilizes native widgets where available to provide a more traditional look and feel.\nWhy I built it:\nI was searching for a cross-platform GUI toolkit for Go that had a more traditional appearance, and none of the existing options quite met my needs. I then started playing with Gocoa and go-fltk and suddenly I worked on an experiment to see how challenging it would be to build something like React in Go, and it kinda evolved into Spot. ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯\nIn 2024, is there a still place for classic desktop GUIs—even with a modern spin?\nI’d love to hear your thoughts, feedback, and any suggestions for improvement. Also, contributions are very welcome.\nThank you for checking it out!\n[1] https://github.com/pwiecz/go-fltk\n[2] https://github.com/roblillack/gocoa\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40469592\nPoints: 60\n# Comments: 9",

          "description": "Hey HN, we're Evis and Nick and we're excited to be launching Neosync (https://www.github.com/nucleuscloud/neosync). Neosync is an open source platform that helps developers anonymize production data, generate synthetic data and sync it across their environments for better testing, debugging and developer experience.\nMost developers and teams have some version of a database seed script that creates some mock data for their local and stage databases. The problem is that production data is messy and it’s very difficult to replicate that with mock data. This causes two big problems for developers.\nThe first problem is that features seem to work locally/stage but have bugs and edge cases in production because the seed data you used to develop against was not representative of production data.\n…",

We've successfully utilized it in genomics to associate billions of \"k-mers\" with taxonomic identifiers while maintaining an efficient memory footprint. But the data structure is also useful beyond computational biology, particularly where you have large unique key domains and constrained value ranges.\nAvailable under an Apache 2 license.

However, property-based testing is not as widely used as in other languages such as Haskell or Elixir, and I think this is because there is no de facto testing tool.\nThis gem currently not only has the basic functionality of stateless property-based testing but also has the following features:\n- Support verbose mode that allows you to see its shrinking procedure and algorithms.\n- Support several concurrency/parallel executions of each test. As of now, Ractor/Thread/Process are available. (The default is sequential, considering benchmark results and actual use cases)\nHappy hacking!\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40441093\nPoints: 150\n# Comments: 17",

So I digitised it. It comes with a few cool features like resource conversions (e.g. converting plants to greenery), production phase, offline, mobile-friendly and keeps track of the history using the browser history itself.

          "description": "Hi. Im looking for a tool to manage various dotfiles/configuration files on my machines and to use it together with Ansible. After a short search i found out hundreds of different threads and articles recommending stow for managing dotfiles, even for my specific scenario - using it with Ansible.\n After trying to use it and checking it's man pages i found out that while it looks great, in real life scenario is completely useless for managing dotfiles:\n Lets say i am setting up a new computer and i want to sync my config from Syncthing. Before running a stow, i need to manually mv the sync'd config (because there are already files like ZSH or GTK config in my home folder) from the Syncthing to my home folder, then adapt it in stow and only then i can play with stow. The thing is, that once i already mv my sync'd config to a new home folder, i no longer need stow. Of course there are cases where the saved config changes and i want to sync it with other machines, but those configs are not changing that often, besides if i have an Ansible script which is mv my saved config to live home folder, i can just run it again? Seems that stow here is just an additional step, which at the end of the day is completely unnecessary? Or am i missing something/designed a bad workflow?\n    submitted by    /u/Dinth  \n [link]   [comments]",

I decided I wanted to learn about 'hacking' without a computer and that's when I discovered termux a linux emulator on android.\n I didn't even care I downloaded scripts when I saw a term for a person like me (script kiddie ) I decided I didn't have to be looked down upon. then I saw Kali Linux but I couldn't do anything since I didn't have a laptop and my parents thought it was 'useless' for a highschooler . I decided to learn about Linux, python and C while still using a phone although it was hard.\n After sometime I found it hard to concentrate on two things so I left termux for my studies and after finishing highschool I got my laptop. The second day I installed Debian since termux was based on It. I fucked up the installation and figured things out after some months I started distro hopping when I decided to keep using fedora for sometime.\n After using Linux as my first real OS I think I can safely say to new users Linux isn't hard if you can use Google and read manuals. Just decide your leaving Windows close the door and don't turn back, everything is hard when you compare it to something. The way you feel about Linux I feel the same about windows but that doesn't mean when my parents ask me why their windows machine has a problem I will say I don't know about windows when they bought me a laptop I've been using for a year.\n Sorry guys for this boring story.\n    submitted by    /u/Caultor  \n [link]   [comments]",

Oreon has fully functional gaming support under Proton/WINE, which never worked on EL.\n Oreon has been actively maintained for 5 months now and supports each release for 10 years.

          "description": "Hi guys, I just started a new job here in Germany and after completing my studies, I got into DevOps as a junior. I really love the networking world and I was already motivated to be in the Linux world than Windows. Our team leader gave us new members (me more 3 other colleagues), a few exercises about docker, ansible, jenkins, and other technologies to explore. I am struggling a lot with learning these technologies and I see that my colleagues are going way better than me (they are figuring out things faster and understanding the concepts). For example, ansible seems to be very \"easy\" to learn as everyone says and from what I read about it but for me has been very confusing. I am very sure that I am the problem and I notice a lot of lack of focus from my side, is not I am putting in lower hours, I actually put in more after work but has been a real struggle for me and after the day, this is killing my head together with my normal anxiety. I was on the Ansible documentation official website and seems so confusing to understand how things work, the same happened in Docker and Jenkins so I know that I am the problem and not the documentation itself. I really think these technologies are very good and a few things I was able to figure it out but has been so hard to my head, like the conceptions and the functionalities of those techs. Am I just really dumb? It will pass after a while or will I keep on this until I give up permanently? I think ansible is the tech that really made me think if this networking world was for me because everyone seems to use it very easily and I am struggling a lot. Well, I hope some of you can share your experiences and give me some ideas. I am on meds after having few panic attacks in the last months and I don't want to have that as an excuse to make this \"normal\" not being able to learn these things more easily. I appreciate if you guys took some time to read this, means a lot to me. Thanks!\n    submitted by    /u/Alive-Zucchini-3377  \n [link]   [comments]",

They care a lot about details and improving the user experience and interaction by identifying what new users are having problems with and trying to make the system welcoming to them. They really listen to feedback and improve. With the 17.1 version, they enhanced by a lot the usability of Windows Programs. For example, nice warnings that say \"This app isn't native to Linux, you can try some alternatives or the compatibility layer\" like recommending Heroic launcher when the user tries to run the Epic executable or automatically putting the program in Bottles.\n I would point out the main page for the Pro edition. In the Why pay page, they state that \"Zorin OS will always be free and open. We want to reward and celebrate those who support our mission, which is why we created Zorin OS Pro\", but it isn't very clear in other places that it's possible to have the same experience in ZorinOS Pro or Core.

          "description": "I've often seen how people talk about Alacritty's performance for example, given it is GPU-accelerated and written in Rust (hence compiled from a low-level language with very little overhead), but from my personal experience, I notice little to no difference from any other terminal emulators, at least not anything significant. I might want to add that my work environment and tools are mainly CLI-driven, and I mostly use CLI applications for everything (text editor, Git CLI, etc), including all the tools I use for my daily work.\n When choosing a terminal emulator, I focus mostly on usability and features. I personally use Wezterm because I find it incredibly malleable and easy to configure, while also providing very nice defaults. When I have used Alacritty in the past, I have found myself not liking it because it sacrifices a lot of things for the sake of performance, but I find myself unable to perceive the benefits of such performance improvements.\n I wanted to hear people's opinions mainly because I think I might be missing something, so please feel free to share your ideas and experiences.\n    submitted by    /u/ema2159  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "So, I was thinking about CC licenses the other day as I generally distribute my photos under CC BY-NC-SA 4.0. This absolutely and completely prohibits OpenAI (ClosedAI lol) from using my photos in training as they are mostly a for profit corp. At the same time, if we are considering a community developed open source model, NC clause doesn't apply any more. With the BY everything is also clear\n The SA (same alike license) part seems to be much more interesting in this case. It is because the photos produced by the model are most definitely derived from my photos and therefore must be distributed under the same or compatible license. Model's architecture, on the other hand, wasn't derived from my photos and therefore use whatever license it wants. Although here things become tricky as, at least as I understand it, the architecture is usually tied with the weights, that are tuned on my photos and, therefore, likely fall under a category of derived work\n Now we have a problem, as (likely) the whole model will need to use CC BY-NC-SA 4.0 or something compatible with it. As far as I'm concerned, there are no licenses compatible with my exact CC license and the CC is not recommend for software\n I think that it is a problem as openai pretty much doesn't care about that (and if it did, removing any part of the CC license can probably allow them to exploit it), while for fair developers of AI it makes content such as mine pretty much inaccessible, therefore benefiting the giant corps\n The only solution to the issue I see is to make a dedicated open license for AI as well as a revision to CC to insure compatibility and clarify such highly speculative points as what pars of models are actually considered derivatives\n Anyway, I want to be clear that I'm neither a lawyer nor a developer and I have never researched this topic in-depth. All I want is to get my thoughts out somewhere and maybe hear some feedback \n    submitted by    /u/kater_pro  \n [link]   [comments]",

They started to prefer permissive licenses more as it suited some people's definition of software freedom. The GPL folks, on the other hand, made it an all or none issue, they wanted to license ALL software under GPL and the other side thought that idea was anti diversity.\n This is very much akin to the editor wars of the Boomer era (Vim vs Emacs) or the IDE wars of the millennial era (Visual Basic vs Borland Delphi, even Netbeans vs Eclipse).\n That's where we stand today and a huge majo…",

          "description": "I couldn't find the postmarketOS subreddit, so I will post about this tip here.\n I recently had a problem updating my Google Nexus 5. After a upgrade, the boot image oversized beyond my device's boot partition limitation (~25M expected to fit 22M).\n I saw that it was compressing with gzip under default level, so I thought it could have a config file. Then I tried to print a help from mkinitfs, but it didn't gave me relevant information. Didn't had a manual neither.\n So I went to their APKBUILD to find out their repository to then read the manual there and found out that the configuration file is found under /usr/share/deviceinfo/deviceinfo file that could be replaced creating one at /etc/deviceinfo file.\n I needed to create a deviceinfo_initfs_compression and deviceinfo_initfs_extra_compression variables both with zstd:best compression:level set to hopefully make it as tiny as possible. Didn't made it as it created a 23M image.\n I thought about giving up on it. Instead I went on reading all the contents of the man page and found out that in /usr/share/mkinitfs/modules directory from 00-default.modules file had a btrfs module. I guess it assumed that I was using btrfs, but when I ran df -Th it returned me ext4 for both userdata* (1-2).\n After removing btrfs module, the boot image lowered to 14M and I could finally flash it and reboot without having to depend on pmbootstrap.\n There is also a vfat module, but I didn't touched it since I couldn't get the device's boot partition filesystem.\n If you happen to be using btrfs and no ext4, might remove ext4 from the modules. But I guess if you got a btrfs partition on your mobile device it means that you have a lof of space already set.\n I'm accepting suggestions to generate a better image file. Maybe use dracut somehow? Anyway, thank you all for reading!!!\n    submitted by    /u/KanuX14  \n [link]   [comments]",

The books on grep/sed/awk also include a comprehensive chapter on regular expressions.\n All my books are free to read online, see https://github.com/learnbyexample/scripting_course#ebooks for links. Markdown source and example files are available in the respective GitHub book repos.\n I've also written interactive TUI apps for some of the exercises from these books. See https://github.com/learnbyexample/TUI-apps for installation instructions. For example, if you have pipx installed, use pipx install awkexercises for the app shown below:\n Screenshot from TUI app for Awk exercises\n I would highly appreciate it if you'd let me know how you felt about my books.

          "description": "Hello Reddit, i wanted to make this update por a long time. Since the original post, lots of thing have happened. I'm discussing internaly the idea of creating a blog about it.\n For a quick recap, i'm a Network Engineer / Programmer that is leading a big Linux corporate migration at Policia Militar de Minas Gerais in Brazil. Our custom Ubuntu 22.04 distro is named \"Guara\" and were officially released yesterday. Guara has lots of custom and opensource software developed for the corporation needs, and aims to replace 22K PCs around the Minas Gerais state. In the first phase, we plan to replace 800 machines running an older Debian distros with mate desktop. This will be our first large scale test, as i write this post Guara is already running in 215 machines. In the second phase we plan to replace Windows 7 and 8 machines. To make the transition smoother we're also creating a series of small tik-tok tutorial videos, teaching basics for end users. Just for a quick note, here are our distro highilights:\n  \nUbuntu 22.04.4 based (24.04 already in the works)\n Onlyoffice 8.0\n Google Chrome\n Linphone as voip client\n Droidcam to use smartphones as webcams\n Some proprietary java applications\n Guara-updater \n Custom application developed for Guara.\n Automaticlally push custom configs at system boot\n \n Guara Installer \n Custom application created for Guara.\n Inventory the system and run initial scripts\n \n Argos Network Center \n Custom application created to test system components\n Test network conectivity\n Set http proxy for all the system (browser, cli and electron apps)\n Remote access with dynamic passwords (like teamviewer)\n \n  \nWe plan to open to project and release all the code as opensource, also create a reference documentation for a corporate linux migration with real world effort and dificulties along the way.\n Here is our special launch video, hope you like it.\n https://youtu.be/0uI0sIvVKAY\n    submitted by    /u/Sea-Load4845  \n [link]   [comments]",

And the great thing is that FOSS developers don't gatekeep their software from Windows/macOS (unlike the other way around), so they can install pretty much every free and open source software out there.\n How do I know this method works? Because it's how I fell in love with FOSS and Linux. I needed a way to remux a video file and all the options out there were paid. Until I came upon ffmpeg, which allowed you to not only remux video, but to do pretty much anything with it. It seemed too good for something that good to be free. That's when I looked into it and learned about free and open source software. After that I slowly switched all of my software to free and open source alternatives, until the only proprietary thing left on my PC was Windows itself.\n    submitted by    /u/crosspacelayer  \n [link]   [comments]",

It feels like the end of an era almost. EL7 was the first release off the EXTREMELY long-lived 2.x kernel before the new versioning. A decade ago, it seemed like the end of an era, working with Linux Kernel 2.4/2.6 for a long time.

          "description": "I've made a few comments now on setting up a computer with a swappable drive tray so one could switch between Linux and Windows and never have the two bump heads with one another.\n I did this back in the XP days and it worked beautifully. \n I had a hot swap drive bay in my PC and basically, when I ran Windows, I had the Windows hard drive in that bay. When I wanted to boot up Linux, I would pull out the Windows drive and slide in the Linux drive. The computer didn't care which drive was in it. It just booted whatever was on it.\n Today, I run Linux only. I've made the jump and removed Windows from my life forever. So I no longer need a hot swap drive system in my computer. I run Linux 24/7.\n But I think one can still use this technique of using a swappable drive bay. And with auto hard drive detection, it should be pretty simple to use 2 different sized drives. But, don't quote me on that. \n So, the best way to accomplish this feat is to get a second hard drive that is the same size/model as the one you already have. So, if you have a 1TB SSD from Western Digital, get a matching 1TB SSD drive from Western Digital. Same model (you might be able to get away with a different size drive but I'm playing it safe here).\n Then get a hot swap drive bay system for your computer. Something that will accommodate those 2 drives. Make sure it has at least 2 hot swap trays.\n Connect the hot swap bay to the computer and now you'll be able to swap between 2 different drives. One with Linux and one with Windows.\n You're going to have to shut down the computer to make the swap. Once the computer is off, swap the drives and power it back up and you should boot into the other.\n It's a pretty simple concept. It's much easier than shutting the computer down and taking the side panel off and swapping cables all the time. Just pull one out from the front of the computer and slide the other one in it's place and boot it up.\n Pretty simple really.\n    submitted by    /u/MarsDrums  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hello Everybody,\n I recently switched to Linux (Arch with KDE Plasma DE), and I love it. However, I feel drawn into the habit of constantly distro-hopping. But I came up with a solution: people of Reddit, you get to pick the Linux distro that I use for the next month on my main PC! The only rule is that you can't make me use a distro that is known spyware or malicious, etc. The most upvoted comment in the next little while (~3 Days probably) will be the distro I use for the next month. This can be anything from Linux From Scratch to Ubuntu to Linux Mint, whatever you think I should use! \n Also, please leave comments 🥺\n Thanks!\n    submitted by    /u/jailbreakiPad2  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "After installing Ubuntu 24.04 LTS, naturally I tried to install Steam with apt, to no avail. I decided to just install through the App Center. After that every Steam game not using OpenGL failed to open, but after opening Steam through terminal I realised it's because 'Steam could not initalize Vulkan' (or something to that effect). After a few hours of troubleshooting, thinking it was my drivers, or the Vulkan installation and considering just reinstalling the OS, I seen a post where someone said to reinstall Steam. After manually adding the repository and reinstalling it, lo and behold everything worked absolutely fine. I believe it's because installing it through apt, it installs 32-bit drivers that you don't get with the App Center version. This is a very dumbed down version of events, I was troubleshooting for a while.\n Perhaps it's my fault, I'm not sure. But, to my knowledge, I did what any typical user would do. Install OS - Update OS - Install drivers - Install Steam (through apt), which failed, so I chose to install through the App Center. So, I'm going to put fault on Ubuntu for this one. I have no idea why it wasn't in the apt repo in the first place.\n    submitted by    /u/sauix  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "About 3 months ago, I posted this: https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/1b5yk9r/kde_plasma_6_how_many_of_you_are_thinking_of/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button\n Now, I can fully say that I've definitely switched from GNOME to KDE Plasma. Mind you, that I'm using NixOS Stable channel, so I only get Plasma 5.27, but even I'm well satisfied. I used GNOME for about 3 years, before switching to KDE Plasma.\n People say KDE Plasma is too much like Windows, it's too much customization, or it's too buggy. I can argue that GNOME isn't enough. It's great for simple users who don't want to customize anything, but over time, it became annoying that the DE had limits, which you could only modify if you added extensions.\n The only bugs I've seen are graphical glitches that causes some stuttering. But it's not really a deal breaker.\n Graphically, KDE Plasma is very impressive. There's a charming affect whenever this DE interacts with you. There's especially a lot \"fading\" effects, like pressing meta key, dragging different open windows, or opening things on the taskbar. But their selection of desktop backgrounds, even their \"start button,\" and even starting it up where it shows the Plasma icon; it's all so charming. Even their notification sounds are very distinguishable.\n Whereas in GNOME, you get some irrelevant sounds like \"dog bark\" or \"glass\" or \"pop\" sound. None of these sounds have style, nor are they memorable.\n It feels really nice when DEs not only make something nice and snappy, but also put some thought and effort into the branding. In GNOME, all you see is the \"activities\" corner, and that doesn't really help, and I can hardly remember the \"foot print\" logo.\n I do have to say, GNOME has made some very useful software that's hard to pass on: GNOME Disks and Disk Usage Analyzer to say the least. I still use some of the default GNOME programs in my systems.\n But overall, KDE Plasma is very impressive.\n    submitted by    /u/nPrevail  \n [link]   [comments]",

And it makes sense, because they're awful at it. Think about it, if you want to change the visibility of a file/directory, you have to rename it, which breaks all sorts of things, such as symbolic links and programs that expect a file/directory to be at a certain path.\n But what's a better solution? It would be so much better if there was simply a file attribute that modifies the visibility of a file/directory. In fact that's what macOS, Windows and (I'm pretty sure) even FreeBSD do.\n And before you say that dotfiles have an advantage of being easily identified as hidden files from the terminal, this too can be easily fixed, by simply modifying the ls command in such a way that it changes the color of the file name such that it identifies it as a hidden file, like it already does with executable files, which it colors as green.\n    submitted by    /u/crosspacelayer  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hi all,\n I am a university student, currently dual booting Linux and Windows on my laptop, at least while I transition from windows. One of the largest troubles I had at the start of using Linux was the lack of the Office 365 suite. I know the LibreOffice exists, but most things at university are shared as .pdf, .ppxt, or word, and not being able to quickly and accurately read and edit these documents is simply not okay. \n ​\n It feels like Microsoft is helping the transition to Linux by making the web version of these apps so good. Soon there will be no difference between the web app and desktop app in windows. In which case, Microsoft will have solved my largest sore spot when switching to Linux. I find this very funny, I don't know why they did this, I suppose because they see collaborative work taking off. I was curious to hear what you guys think, and if you use these apps as well, or do you live with the Libre suite?\n    submitted by    /u/coolbob74326  \n [link]   [comments]",

What are the recommended approaches to managing the following:\n  \napplications like a web browser\n applications like fan control binaries, command line tools like git\n programming language or development runtimes (with versioning, and some way to separate system installations from developer installations)\n package management for programming language runtimes\n developer tools like IDEs which must interact with the above runtimes\n system installation and dependent packages\n config files for all of these things\n  \nI feel strongly that 4 shouldn’t be handled directly by the system package manager or by flatpak. But this might get tricky when 4 and 5 are somewhat linked like with Jupyter notebooks (not sure if there’s better examples of such issues). This also means NixOS is probably not what I want unless I’m misunderstanding how it works.\n The other tricky thing might be 1/7 when it comes to theming, or any global shared configuration.\n    submitted by    /u/PreciseParadox  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "It just takes following some simple steps. One, stick with reputable, mainstream hardware vendors who have a proven track record of working well with Linux.\n Two, stick with mainstream, reputable distros that have a proven track record of working well for users. Yes that means something like Mint is, for the vast majority of people, going to be a better choice than whatever the distro/TWM flavour of the week is.\n Three, STOP copying and pasting commands, scripts, whatever you found on the internet unless you actually understand what it's doing. So sick of people borking their systems following some \"guide\" only to then come on here and complain Linux sucks. Linux doesn't suck. You suck. Who gave you the power of sudo? :P\n Four, immutable distros like Silverblue or Aeon have promise, but right now the fact they rely on flatpaks is a major weak point, because flatpaks still often have problems with stability, or permissions issues. It's always improving, and I don't mean to hate at all, but IMHO, flatpak shouldn't be considered Mainstream just yet. Stick to your package manager as much as possible.\n And lastly, RTFM. No you shouldn't use PPAs with Debian. That's just one example. Stop expecting Linux to be Windows. It's not Windows. Just lke Mac isn't Windows. And don't expect WINE to work. Sometimes it does. Oftentimes it doesn't. \n K, I'm done now.\n -happy Linux \"average desktop user\" since 2010-ish :P\n (and don't forget to backup your home folder so when you ignore all this advice and break your system you don't lose all your personal files)\n edit: crossed out some stuff, because some others here pointed out it was needlessly snarky, and they were right to do so. I wasn't being entirely serious with the snark, but it's hard to communicate that through text, so I apologize.\n    submitted by    /u/not3ottersinacoat  \n [link]   [comments]",

You'll see I'm not as tech-savvy as you guys, but I'm learning :)\n I have the laptop since 2020, and was struggling with space even though I've deleted basically everything I could from it. I thought those 40+gb I could never remove were from windows spyware bs so I was like \"xfce is lighter so it should just use like, 20gb instead of 40 idk\" (it doesn't make sense but back then I had no clue what was going on) however, mint couldn't erase the disk. I looked up my partitions for the first time ever and found the problem. I went back to windows but due to the bitlock, I couldn't format it, erase, nothing.\n I'm currently formatting the whole pc and man, I'm so tired. Apparently from what I read online there are more companies selling pre-bitlocked machines. Nevermind win 11 trying to push bitlock at install (I have win 10 tho) right now win10 is pushing its copilot ai.\n As for mint itself, I had zero problems with download, authenticity/integrity check and usb burn. Woah, what a surprise (sarcasm) I didn't do much on live session but it seemed nice. I hope everything goes smooth 🤞\n    submitted by    /u/dmitri_dmitrovski  \n [link]   [comments]",

With that renewed interest, comes renewed hate toward the Linux desktop by people who feel personally confronted by the privacy + freedom oriented philosophy most Linux users subscribe to.\n \"Privacy doesn't matter to me\" is the common response.\n That is fine. What should matter to users is reliance. Plenty of potential Linux users forgoe the switch because their favorite big tech software doesn't run on Linux.\n \"I have built spreadsheets that don't open in LibreOffice/OpenOffice\"\n \"I need Adobe to edit pictures/create music/read my DRM protected books\"\n These are statements that should give you pause. Is it acceptable that you are reliant on a piece of software to the extent that it ties you to an operating system and set of apps that could be taken away from you at any second? Let us focus on the first statement; how much will you pay for Excel (either in cash or your privacy) so that you can continue editing your favorite spreadsheet? Is there a point at which you would force yourself to learn how to program or translate these spreadsheets into LibreOffice?\n You may not care about Privacy or Freedom, but Microsoft and Apple will at some point set a price that will have you wishing you were Independent.\n No one who switches to Linux should expect the transition to be easy. There will be quirks on your system that you will have to iron out and there are just fundamental differences between Windows and Linux that you will have to get used to. In other words you will need to learn. If you think that is a waste of time, that's fine. In my eyes, and in many others', learning a new skill is never a waste if time.\n I hope this provides a useful perspective.\n    submitted by    /u/wallbucks  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "So I often think about this one time when I was installing Linux as a dual boot on my new computer. The installation would go smooth, but after logging in I couldn't for the life of me get anything to show up. For example I was able to fire up a terminal, execute commands perfectly fine, no errors at all. But starting some applications wouldn't work, they would show up in htop but I couldn't see them. I spent a day debugging this and installed ~5 different distros but still found no solution.\n Being done I got up from my computer, turned on my TV and saw my desktop on the TV. The computer was connected to the TV via HDMI and would make it a primary display despite it being turned off... Having 5 years of experience with Linux I started exploring drivers, looking into logs etc. and it didn't occur to me to check the connected displays.\n Do you have any stories with Linux where you turned out to be a complete idiot when in reality the solution was as simple as unplugging a cable?\n    submitted by    /u/Mrkaniclol  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hello everyone,\n I am excited to introduce my new project, kickstart.dotfiles, a Python-based tool designed to streamline the management of your dotfiles. You can fork or clone the repository, put your dotfiles there, and write linking configurations in a JSON format. After running the tool, your dotfiles are linked based on the provided configuration.\n Key Features:\n  \nClone Git Repositories: Easily clone specified Git repositories to desired directories, e.g. a separate nvim config.\n Symlink Creation: Automatically create symlinks for static files and folders.\n Template Management: Generate and link files from templates, supporting environment variable substitution, including base64-encoded values for multiline variables.\n Template Difference Checking: Compare generated files with template files to identify differences.\n Backup Existing Files: Backup existing files before overwriting them to ensure no data is lost.\n Dry-Run Mode: Preview the actions without making any changes to ensure everything is correct.\n  \nWhy Another Dotfiles Manager\n I needed a simple script to link my dotfiles from a git repo to the $HOME directory. I do not really like the idea of storing anything encrypted in the repo itself, as all my secrets are stored separately. Plus, I wanted something simple, without any dependencies - you just need environment variables with your secrets and the kickstart.dotfiles repository to set up everything.\n Example\n The repository provides a comprehensive example. See the bash script for some additional details:\n bash git clone https://github.com/Foat/kickstart.dotfiles.git cd kickstart.dotfiles ./example/run.sh --config ./example/config@linux.json \n Running the script: bash python kdf.py --config path/to/config.json [--dry-run] [--check-templates] \n Feel free to ask any questions, provide feedback, or contribute to the project.\n    submitted by    /u/Gippius  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Here's what I believe Microsoft (and partners) have in store for the future: they are going all-in on pulling an Apple-style switch to ARM on the PC hardware market. This move has several concomitant side-effects:\n  \nMaking AI a mandatory feature on the PC, with all the juicy free data they will be able to harvest from it. Requiring an NPU (i.e. an AI-capable chip) as a standard on all future PCs.\n Herding all the PC Gamer market onto the XBOX (which will still be Intel/AMD based) and possibly onto other upcoming compatible consoles (there's been talk of allowing Steam and Epic marketplaces on the XBOX platform, which would be HUGE... also, a Steam console, anyone?) It's possible that the x86_64 architecture will remain in wide use as gaming hardware.\n (Possibly) Locking down the ability of booting Linux or any other OS on such ARM hardware. This should be contested with all the Anti-Trust legal recourse available everywhere. (EDIT: disproved here)\n Setting back the advance of the Linux marketshare at least for a while. \n  \nThis last point is the one I would emphasize the most: currently, Linux on ARM seems to be kind of an afterthought among developers, and most distributions have builds targeted at the Raspberry Pi and such small platforms. To my knowledge, only RHEL (and its community clones) offer an ARM build with full desktop capabilities, but these seem to be targeted at servers.\n How long until the major Linux distributions catch up with the switch to ARM, and become ready to deliver the current level of software reliability onto the new PCs?\n Easy with the downvoting, people!\n I am presenting my concerns here, I believe these issues should be discussed.

          "description": "Microsoft recently announced that they will officially be monitoring every single action users make. This decision is likely to upset many people, creating an opportunity for Linux developers to capitalize on this advantage. To attract more users, developers should consider increasing advertisements, such as YouTube ads, to highlight the benefits of switching to Linux. Additionally, emphasizing improvements in game support, controller support, ease of use with Wayland, and the new Nvidia 555 driver, which adds explicit sync, could further entice users to make the switch. By focusing on these key areas, Linux could significantly increase its market share. However, advertising could be challenging given the multitude of Linux distributions available. Forming a union or coalition of Linux distributions to pool resources and create unified marketing campaigns could be a viable strategy, although it may be difficult to achieve. To fully capitalize on this moment, Linux developers and advocates should highlight compatibility and support, promote security and privacy, leverage community support, and showcase commercial options. The developers should emphasize the underlying issue with Windows, which is currently privacy and performance, areas where Linux excels. Showcasing commercial options could also be a good start, presenting well-supported commercial distros like Ubuntu, Mint, and Pop!_OS. By implementing these strategies, the Linux community can better position itself to attract users disillusioned by Microsoft's recent actions.\n    submitted by    /u/Comfortable_Two2925  \n [link]   [comments]",

On top of that there are Asus laptops with short bottom strip-screen or some Chinese/Lenovo laptops with a side screen on the palmrest. And there are also foldable \"laptops\" :)\n For the Asus Zenbook Duo I saw only one reviewer trying Linux - trying Majaro and failing with making it work properly - where depending where the keyboard is placed the device disables/enables bottom screen, handles BT/pogo-pin keyboard pairing and more.\n The strip screen on other Asus laptops is also proprietary where it either works as a screen or integrates with (Windows) apps that use SDK for it.\n We are getting more and more unique laptop/tablet designs but more and more of their value is being hidden behind software/probably some drivers which then hits Linux bad.

As a long lasting Linux user, this sometimes makes me want to return to windows.

I have played around a bit with Gnome builder, but to be completely honest, using XML for the UI is a complete nightmare, for me as someone who is Dyslexic.. It is not that I have never used XML, i have done some developing for Android using XML, but building UI in GNOME builder is a whole new level of …..\n Blueprints seems way more manageable, a lot more similar to Jetpack Compose.\n Gnome builder doesn’t appear to support Blueprint at all, when taking another look at Workbench, it appears like it could be used as a full blown IDE and not just as a companion tool for Gnome builder.\n Gnome Builder supports C, Vala, Java, Rust.. Workbench appears to support Java, Vala and/or Rust? Workbench seems to be fully capable to convert Blueprint to XML.\n I have also gotten my hands on what I believe is the necessary files to try to develop for Linux using Android Studio with Kotlin Multi-Platform.\n I hope to do some tinkering this weekend, but I would like some advice if possible, could I try using Workbench as an IDE, should I use it as a translation tool (build the UI in workbench using Blueprint, switch it over to XML and copy that in to Gnome Builder), start exploring Kotlin Multi-platform or use some other IDE?\n    submitted by    /u/Whit-Batmobil  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "A somewhat sad day: Ron Amadeo is leaving Ars Technica and based on his [tweet](https://x.com/RonAmadeo/status/1801422612238585927), it sounds like he's more finished with writing completely than anything else: \n \"I guess I should tell everyone that I have quit! After 10 years at Ars Technia I'm done writing. I you've ever read anything of mine, thanks.\"\n Anyway, it's a big shame as Ron fearlessly held Google and co accountable, and over that 10 years mercilessly beat brands to death for substandard efforts. He famously started here in r/Android and worked his way up.\n It's the end of an era in some ways. The days of Android/iOS being interesting enough to do massive reviews and deep dives is over. Android and iOS are not boring but it's no longer wildly interesting to see what's coming next. At Google, Dave Burke who headed up Android for 14 years is moving to \"AI/bio\". \n Guys from the early Android era have largely left: Dieter Bohn is at Google now, Ron is leaving, David Ruddock left Android Police a few years ago to do something (I forget what) and is in Germany working elsewhere, Kris Carlon and lots of the Android Authority OGs have moved on - too many to name - but the long experienced and often very critical journalists/writers/analysts have left for other, hopefully greener pastures.\n No one is irreplaceable but some of the most trusted names, who know all of the good and bad, and didn't shy away from calling it out, are gone.

I have NEVER seen people with so many issues with apple id as our family has within the last few months. What really pissed me off was the fact that I could not use my iPad to color and listen to music for my anxiety. I was walking around in circles at my house like a nut. Everything was activation locked. I was really pissed off. I contacted my carrier who was nice enough to apply a credit on all three and let me return it and then sent me new android devices. I had explained I never had an issue being locked out of Google for 15 years. All you need is your phone number and a family members added to multi factor and voila you're back in. You literally have to wait at least from a week to a month to get back in. It's stupid. \n    submitted by    /u/Amazing-Divide3286  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Howdy, Reddit!\n A little while ago I wrote a simple power consumption benchmark for Android web browsers, called browser-power-hour. I've since used it to test Chrome against Firefox on two different devices, and I'm here to share the results!\n Why is this useful? It's pretty common to see battery drain brought up as a reason to use (or avoid) certain web browsers, often without evidence. But browsers are complex and constantly evolving pieces of software... maybe those perceptions are out of date? Maybe they're still valid! Unlike raw performance, there are few, if any, good ways to reliably measure battery impact for an individual app, especially on Android, so it's hard to tell what's actually true. Hence, this project! My goal is to be able to provide objective metrics on browser power…",

          "description": "I'm curious what others are using as I'm looking to upgrade my watch to one that would pair well with an Xperia 1 V. I have used Fossil watches for the last few years but they've exited the smartwatch market and their watches were pretty meh but they were at least independent of any particular phone (like how the Galaxy Watch is meant to pair with Samsung devices). I've been eyeing the OnePlus watch since it's the best looking of the 3 main options available (Samsung, Google, OnePlus) but was also looking at the Tic Watch for it's long battery. All I really use my watch for is counting steps and dealing with notifications (bonus points if I can control my alarm app from the watch). So what's everyone using?\n    submitted by    /u/-Arkham  \n [link]   [comments]",

I just wanted to point this out because on every iPhone video, whenever the creator shows off the iPhone’s camera, not even stating a single name of Android, Android users just come and bash the comments with “Oh this S24…”, “S24:…” “S24 better…” etc. However, when people show off their S24 (or any android) camera, iPhone users never comment on them, and they just respect it. May I know why this is the case for majority and why Android users hate on Apple users? Why do Apple users have more calmness than majority of Android users?

          "description": "DigiPaws is an open-source Android productivity utility designed to help users reduce screen addiction by regulating app usage through a gamified experience. The application offers three distinct modes—Easy, Adventure, and Hard—each with unique features and challenges to promote healthy screen time habits.\n 🌱 Easy mode: When you attempt to access a blocked app, a warning screen appears. If you choose to proceed, a cooldown period starts. After the cooldown, another warning is displayed to remind you of your usage.\n ✨ Adventure Mode: introduces a gamified experience to control screen time. To access a blocked app, you need DigiCoins. These can be earned by completing quests such as a quick 1 km walk. Each DigiCoin grants 20 minutes of usage time for any blocked app, encouraging physical activity and mindful screen use. - Quests 1. Touch Grass - Displace yourself by 1km 2. Api (todo) - other devs can tranform their existing app as an digipaw quest! 3. more quests- comming soon. Drop ideas below\n 🤯 Hard mode: Hard Mode offers the most stringent control over app usage. In this mode, when you try to open a blocked app, the back button is automatically pressed without any warning or cooldown, preventing access entirely.\n Available blockers; Short form content blocker Comments and video description blocker App blocker Explicit content blocker \n Give me a ✨ at https://github.com/nethical6/digi-paws\n Wanna try it? https://github.com/nethical6/digi-paws/tags\n    submitted by    /u/Nethical69  \n [link]   [comments]",

I use it with 5G on, screen at full resolution, dynamic \"smooth display\" refresh rate is on, no bluetooth or tethering. Brightness left on auto.\n TLDR : Positives = Camera quality, great design & display, OS (with some caveats) | Negatives = everything else\n The positives :\n Camera : beautiful imagery has always been the signature of the Pixel line, and this release is no exception. Every shot has this mesmerizing \"Pixel touch\", and the new ultrawide sensor is finally on par with the main unit. Videos are world class too, not quite on the level of the iPhone but we'll get there eventually.\n Beautiful and unique design : It's sitting…",

While I was aware of several physical limitations like slow charging, 60Hz refresh rate and notch(dynamic island), I always believed that iphone's true magic was its usability. However, using it for few days has made me realize how underwhelming iOS is in terms of basic functionalities. This was definitely not what I expected from an enterprise that prides itself on being design centric. That's why I am writing this use case based assessment of iOS and iphone comparing it with similar functionalities in Android so that anyone thinking about making the switch can make an informed decision.\n Usecase 1) - Segregating Volume levels of app notifications and call ringtone - I get maybe more than 50 notifications a day.

          "description": "毕业参加工作后，老家一堆人找我借钱，两个童年的发小，各自借了几千，到约定还钱的时候找不见人，微信，电话统统无法联系，过几天有一个居然主动找我，没想到开口还是借钱，借八百月底先还一千，之前失约我生气怼了几句，对方居然当场翻脸，撂话说还的起不要催，以后不会再找我借一毛钱，保持距离啥的。网上人家常说，借钱后可能就无法做朋友，对于这个结果，我提前做了心里准备，但还是有点吃惊，几千块就能让人推翻十几年的“友谊”形成陌路，也许是我把感情看太重了。另一个失踪的发小，当初车贷到期，老婆产子住院缺钱的的时候，如何信誓旦旦的保证，现在看就是一个笑话，不靠谱的人，永远都不会靠谱。\n龙年春节前，弟弟结婚，彩礼钱不够，父亲找我要了两万，说不是补贴家里用，而是算借给弟弟结婚用，我给了。婚后弟弟表现真是让人无法置评，班不好好上，存粹是父亲一个人养活他夫妻俩。有次我看不下去和弟弟电话沟通谈及为张罗婚事父亲欠了很多钱，以及以他名义借两万的事情，他表示并不知情，对于这笔钱，我还能不能要回来，或者说我想拿回来给父亲的钱，这合情合理吗？\n婚礼举行，我请假回家几天期间，大伯找我借钱，理由是好不容易考下来驾驶证，想买辆车开开，运点农产品什么，可是他们家，大堂哥有一辆微型货车，二堂哥一辆微型货车+SUV ，我拒绝了，因为真的再拿不出大几万块。婚礼完毕送我到车站的大堂哥表示贷款压力太大希望我借点钱缓解缓解。\n我返杭不久，有天准备下班回出租屋，父亲电话过来说，舅舅打算买辆车，全款不够，向他开口借两万，他已经被婚礼掏空，舅舅就想找我，我寻思你借钱直接找我，怎么让我爸来问我，让他代借呢？父亲表示以前家里很穷，他借了村里的高利贷，还不上，债主过来把年猪牵走，是舅舅拉了一把，如果是别人开口他不会理财，唯独舅舅，对我们家有恩，希望我还这个人情，我当时就答应了，不知道他喝了酒还是什么，隔天又三番四次打电话过来问我答不答应，听着像规劝又像命令，搞得我很烦，最后舅舅主动联系我，转了钱才结束。其他借钱的人，像表弟什么的，就不说了，借一千五还一千，说什么刚交车险手头紧，后面再借都拒绝了，原本热情的关系，瞬间变得冰冷。\n过年回家期间，好像三姑六姨，街坊邻居，认识的每个人都在打听我的工资，热情地让我不自在，好像我是被锁定的猎物一般，那种感觉，特别是得知大学生毕业，工资也就几千块，露出警觉又怀疑的表情的时候。\n唯一不关心我工资，也不想要我钱的人，恐怕就只有外婆了，真正对我好，不计回报的人。\n夜深人静的胡思乱想，浪费大家几分钟的时间阅览。",

          "description": "各位 V 友晚上好，先简单介绍一下背景，我目前购买了三家机场的订阅，其中一家机场提供了 EMBY 服务，仅限他自己的节点来访问；目前主力使用的代理工具为 OpenClash ，我通过订阅转换将三家机场的节点合并成了一个配置文件，但因订阅转换实使用的是公共的远程配置，自然也无法自定义 EMBY 服务使用的节点了。\n想要达成的效果不算很复杂，即能有一个 EMBY 的策略组和规则，且这个策略组中只包含了那家机场的所有节点，并且希望更新订阅时，策略组和规则不会被移除等。\n目前有一些思路，比如在 clash 端设置自定义规则和策略组，或者在订阅转换时增加相应的策略组和规则。后者若能实现适用性更广一些，届时可用于其他一些代理软件。\n无奈本人比较小白，经过一些搜索和学习，还是没能理解和掌握 OpenClash 中自定义的功能，特别时“覆写设置”、“一键生成”、“规则附加”以及“配置管理”中的“自定义”字眼的设置，还望各位 V 友能够不吝赐教，先在此谢过了！",

L 系列能进入美国的话, 绝对能把那些歪瓜裂枣打得落花流水, 我对这话负责)\n李想同学对于车型和配置还是很有深刻了解的, 脚踏实地造人民想要的车也是个正确的方向, 也许能在这激烈的竞争环境中脱颖而出.\n现在已经全力买 LI 了.\n企业做大后也许还是要有远大的理想, 开发前沿科技改变出行方式能让理想走得更远?\nBYD:\n炙手可热.\n国内外很多人不了解造车新势力, 但对 BYD 却不陌生. 在控制成本和研发方面确实也做得很好, 也许能取代丰田独领全球汽车市场?\n个人对 BYD 车的设计和配置实在提不起兴趣, 人还是要有的审美的吧. \n小米:\nSU7 也许是一辆好车, 市场好像也不错.\n小米能整合供应链, 也能开发出自己的东西, 后续车型应该也不错.\n小米已经是巨型企业了, 实在没必要做这种赤裸裸的抄袭. 还真没想到普罗大众对抄袭的容忍度这么高. \n问界以及各种界:\n有些车型在用料方面还是舍得下本的, 华为光环对车还是有实际提升的.\nAgain, 个别车型的外观抄袭还是很无耻的.\n造车厂商和华为还是存在利益分歧的, 苹果在已经栽了, 很怀疑各种界能否走得长远.\n其他各品牌:\n这个我也没啥有意义的看法, 传统厂商滞后了这么多年, 不知道其现在能否取得优势. 也许能在成本和质量方面取得优势, 这恰恰也是最重要的, 这成就了丰田, 也许能成就某些传统厂商.\n好啦, 这里就瞎扯啦一些自己的看法, 也提到了股票. 主要是想了解车, 买股票只是想验证自己的看法.\n车圈水军脑残粉太多了, 希望这里能看到更多真实的想法)))",

          "description": "上一个帖子是因为看到了《脱了裤子放屁》那篇帖子写的，但不仅仅是因为这篇，印象中之前也看到过类似的，记不清了，也可能是无中生记了。\n我也说说我的看法，不一定对，欢迎拍砖指正，只要说得对，骂一骂也没关系。（我这篇也是来秀无知的)\n++++++++++++++++++++++++++\n首先明确的是，重放攻击的重点在于：如果有第三方拿到一个网络请求，在不解包的情况下，重复发送该请求，会造成服务出现\"安全问题\"。\n\n第一，攻击者不需要解包，因为它的假设是，攻击者(不需要/不能)从请求中抓取有用信息，也(不需要/不能)篡改请求。\n\n第二，跟幂等的关系。幂等的意思是 n 次操作的结果等同于一次操作，是允许多次操作的，而防重放供给是不允许重复请求的，这会造成\"安全隐患\"。不过对于某些场景某些实现的\"幂等\"是可以起到防重的作用的。比如某些幂等的实现是只有第一次请求是真的在操作，后续重复请求实际上是\"没有操作\"的。\n举个不恰当的例子：假如你有一个登录接口在登录成功后返回用户信息，内部实现也支持了幂等，即：同一个用户多次登录和一次登录的效果是等效的,session 只有一个，但是却没有考虑重放攻击的问题。再假设攻击者拦截到该登录请求，是不是攻击者在不修改请求的情况下，也可以登录系统？\n\n第三，限流是限流，重放攻击是重放攻击。限流强调频次，重放攻击的重点不在于频次，它可能只需要一次就可以攻击成功。我们需要明确自己需要的是限流还是防重放攻击还是都需要？\n\n第四，请求需要被加密保护或者有私钥签名是基本条件，因为如果请求不加密，也没有私钥签名/加密，一定能被攻击者构造。但是跟 https 协议本身有没有防重放攻击的支持没有关系，这两个不在同一层面。\napi 请求可以是像 web 端被 https 加密保护，也可以是给第三方使用被一个\"私钥\"保护。\n第五， 我认为这是容易造成混乱边界范围不清晰的一个点。即：\"重复一个请求\"指的是重复用户\"发出的请求\"，还是说，攻击者也可以根据客户端泄露的代码等信息\"构造出一条参数一摸一样的请求\"。我认为是前者，\n因为攻击者如果是通过查阅客户端代码构造出请求，它可以构造出任何请求。这种情况应该不在\"重放攻击\"范围内，重放攻击本身也是属于中间人攻击。\n\n第六，原帖提到\"token 的生成规则\"，说\"攻击者也可以完全模拟这个 token 的生成规则，来绕过服务端\"。攻击者当然可以拿到生成规则，包括生成签名的公钥。\n\t1. 作者的方案，是客户端生成 token ，假定了攻击者能够拿到客户端的规则、可能还包括了生成签名的公钥。所以攻击者可以构造一个攻击请求。但是这不是\"重放攻击\"的讨论范围，这不是\"拦截到请求进行重放\"，而是构造了一个新的请求，该请求的参数可以由攻击者任意指定。\n\t\t2. 对于客户端生成 token ，因为含有：随机数、时间戳，所以服务端可以在一次处理完成之后记忆下来，在近 n 分钟内不再处理含有相同随机数、时间戳的请求。中间人自然无法重放攻击。中间人即便拦截到请求，也无法篡改其随机数、时间戳，可能是因为整个请求是加密的、也可能是因为请求含有私钥签名。\n\n最后，原作者说：\"sync ，lock ，多线程等，工作中根本用不到\"，作者给出的代码，很明显有一个地方因为没有用锁或者 redis 的原子操作，会导致这个代码防重失效。\n且看原作者代码：\n```\n\t\tString s = redisService.opsForValue().get(timestamp);\n\t\tif (StringUtils.isNotEmpty(s)) {\n\t\t\treturn false;\n\t\t} else {\n\t\t\tredisService.opsForValue().set(timestamp, timestamp, NONCE_DURATION, TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS);\n\t\t}\n```",

          "description": "不太想吃个哑巴亏，求大伙帮我分析一下。\n我前两天在京东上买了一个京东京造的充电宝，当晚给我媳妇的 iphone xs 充电。第二天我媳妇说这手机一直在发烫，不充电也发烫。我让我媳妇赶紧去换个电池。\n今天在维修点，检测人员说电池健康状态看着还行，估计是主板出问题了，换了新电池可能一样会发热，解决不了问题。说我们这手机也有点老了不值得再浪费钱修了。和他说了是用充电宝之后这样的，他说可能有关系。\n结果就是我在京东上花了九千块钱给我媳妇买了一新手机。哎。我也不是心疼钱，本来打算等九月出新款再买的，现在计划打乱了有点不爽。\n接下来就气人了。我去京东上找客服问。咱们实话实说，我是心想，你这玩意给我手机冲坏了，我 TM 还花九千块钱在你这买个手机，你哪怕给我五十块手机抵用券也算意思一下了对不？也不过分吧？\n然后这京东的客服，我是真的无语。这是培训出来故意怼人的吗？一顿“请提供证据证明是充电宝导致的”，“有维修站点开具的证明吗”，“无法证明是我们充电宝的问题”，证明是我们充电宝问题我再给您处理”。我去，我本来好好的，聊两句给我气够呛。\n我媳妇这手机在使用充电宝之后开始发热是事实，在时间上是有先后顺序的。咱们有一说一，也确实有可能是巧合。这因果关心我是证明不了的。检测点开具证明也是天方夜谭，检测点连我的手机使用过这个充电宝这种简单事实都证明不了，怎么敢开具证明说是京东的充电宝导致我的手机坏了？能说一句“有可能”“不排除”就顶天了。在几率渺茫的情况下我也不可能花大价钱去做这个检测吧，除非给我报销。\n我不太懂硬件，想请相关技术的朋友帮我分析一下。有没有可能是充电宝对旧手机型号支持有问题，充电过载了把主板弄残了所以一直发热？我就想知道有没有这种可能。\n如果说从技术上讲就赖不到这充电宝头上那就算我理亏了。如果说这种可能概率还比较大，我就去再找个平台投诉一下。我没有胜诉的希望，我单纯就发泄一下。手机一冲就坏了然后一个劲儿被人怼鼻子说“证明是我们充电宝问题我再给您处理”是真 TM 憋屈。",

          "description": "之前一直是用 kindle KPW 看书，正经书籍，网文都看，每天阅读也不小至少 30-60 分钟，至少算半个重度使用。kindle 现在卡的已经不行了，而且看 pdf 很难用（切边，重排等），再加上国产读书越来越好用了，决定抛弃 kindle 生态。但是对国产阅读器不是很了解，求推荐。\n大致需求是：\n1. 必须是带背光墨水屏，不要 ipad 。眼睛已经高度近视了，看久了电子屏幕会累，发紧。\n2. 为了便携，不超过 7-8 寸。也不需要笔，不用笔记，不用看漫画，带不带声音不在乎。开放还是闭源系统无所谓，能满足看书就行。\n3. 看 pdf 重排和切边等希望比较强。我看的 pdf 主要是一些学习用的教材（不是数理化那种，而是经济类这种文字占主要篇幅的），为了便携选择小屏幕了，所以必须能切边重排，不能像 kindle 一样看 pdf 一坨。。。\n4. 最好支持微信读书，一是三端互通传书方便，二是读那种 txt 网文能自动分章节。但是如果能满足上面两个特点，换掉微信读书也行。\n谢谢大家了！！！",

          "description": "最近在小红书上看到有人分享的支付宝开始支持NFC 支付的消息，发现他们现在正在上海静安大悦城进行试点推广，趁着还没打烊，立马杀了过去体验了一下，给大家分享下\n（注：本贴图片均可以点击跳转大图）\n宣传活动\n首先能看到的是他们的宣传，目前的活动是扫码领取最高 20 块的商场立减券，我领到了 9 块\n虽然活动日期写的是到 10 号，不过看券的详情，最近的几个周末大概率都有活动\n想参与的最好先别扫这个，领了今天就过期，建议等下个周末再看看\n\n\n\n支持商户\n在商户的支持上，目前静安大悦城的大部分商户都没问题，基本每个柜台上都能看到支付宝的NFC 收款设备，另外上海的一些便利店也有支持，未来应该可以进一步普及\n尽管如此，有个非常尴尬的问题摆在面前，就是上海大部分的连锁餐饮店都实现了线上点单，整个大悦城 B1 层没有几个店是有必要用NFC 支付的（虽然他们都摆出来了），真正适合拿出来用的还是优衣库、NIKE 、名创等这些购物店\n\n支付流程\n接着是实际的支付流程：\n对于商户来讲，跟付款码支付应该没太大区别（也不应该有）\n点亮屏幕，解锁手机\n手机 NFC 区域靠近支付宝设备\n支付宝自动唤起（图 1），界面无订单信息，仅有确认支付按钮（苹果可能会多一步 App Clips ）\n点击确认按钮，完成支付（图 2），稍等显示订单支付详情（图 3）\n\n\n\n整个流程在安卓端的使用体验还是比较流畅的（大部分厂商对支付宝启动、后台都有优化）\n个人没有苹果设备，不过就小红书上看到的视频，iPhone 体验并不是很好，首先多了一步 App Clips ，之后支付宝的启动加载速度也不如人意，估计预先启动下支付宝会好点\n唤起后没有订单、商户、支付方式等信息有点让人懵逼，可能是为了支付速度考虑\n实现方式？\n个人对这个领域并不非常了解，随便推测下，欢迎大家指正交流\n是什么：可以唤起支付宝的动态 NFC Tag ？\n安卓 Intent / 苹果 App Clips ？\n客户端可以根据订单号向服务器发送确认支付的请求\n支付完成后可以根据订单号查询订单金额、商户、支付方式等\n如果不携带有可能根据其他因素来确定订单吗？（时间、定位、蓝牙 etc.）\n确认界面什么信息都没有，商户号好像没必要？\n确认界面什么信息都没有，大概率没带\n为什么：根据前面的支付截图推测，Tag 里大概只有订单号，甚至在点击确认支付按钮前客户端可能都没有联网查询订单信息，支付成功前的数据交互非常简洁，这是为了整个支付体验更加流畅，减少不稳定网络因素的影响吗？\n总之整个体验下来还是挺新鲜的，也产生了不少疑问，就目前的流程来看，并没有比付款码方便多少，支付宝冷启动的情况下流畅度也未必能保证，乍一看好像没有什么必要。不过对于新的探索个人还是愿意支持的，大家都对 NFC 支付的期望很大，如果能有一个成熟落地的方案，相信能够解决排队刷码的痛苦，给生活带来更多便利~",

          "description": "看到很多人说 spring security 复杂。个人认为复杂以下几个方面。（说句废话：研究过其实也就不复杂了）\n第一，spring security 的 filter 和如何配置 filter 这两部分的设计是分离的，恰恰是如何配置 filter 这部分做了高度抽象（涉及 HttpSecurity 、WebSecurity 、SecurityConfigurer 、SecurityBuilder 相关接口），导致不熟悉的用户很难将 filter 内部和配置串联起来。我认为这些高度抽象的配置相关设计让用户感到复杂的罪魁祸首。\n\n第二，通常最符合我们直觉的是：一个请求会经过哪些 filter ，以 url 的角度来描述 filter 序。但事实上配置起来可不是这么回事，配置时我们通常是：这个 filter 需要匹配哪些 url ，站在了 filter 的角度去匹配 url 。当有人接手我们的代码，或者我们自己，在稍微复杂一点的个性化需求下，也需做一个心理模型的转换，转换到一个请求应该先后经过哪些 filter 才能达到我们的预期。\n第三，spring security 的 filter 某些设计是有些复杂，比如用户密码登录 filter 又涉及到 authenticationManager ，用户信息查询、密码处理以及登录成功失败如何按需处理等等，鉴权部分又涉及到表达式，但其实 debug 串一串还好。\n第四，filter 是有序的，比如登录 filter 前后有一些重要的 filter ，可能和 session/cookie 相关，可能和 SecurityContext 相关，可能和异常相关，这一部分我觉得遵循\"filter 有序\"debug 串一串，读一读源码其实行也还好。如果想要知道 servlet 的 filter 是怎么搞的，spring 的 filter 又是如何桥接到 servlet 中的 filter 的，filter 又是怎么到 controller 的，怎么样可以 filter 直接 response 而不用到 controller ，怎么样可以让一个请求不走 filter 直达 controller 可能还需要再花点功夫。\n\n暂时想到这些。综合起来我觉得导致用户感到复杂的就是\"高度抽象的配置接口\"，其他看看官方文档，滴一滴 bug ，看看源码接口设计其实都不是啥问题。",

          "description": "Investors usually dislike gambling comparisons. Yet at a recent conference held by Norges Bank Investment Management, which oversees Norway’s oil fund of $1.6trn, a packed hall sought to learn from a former poker pro. Annie Duke was there to talk about quitting decisions, a topic on which she wrote the book (“Quit: The Power of Knowing When to Walk Away”). Ms Duke argued that many factors stack the deck against people considering quitting, pushing them to act irrationally. That applies to poker players wondering whether or not to fold—and also to investors considering whether to exit a position.\n赌场环境下，有很多因素导致玩家做出非理性的选择，投资者也类似。\na packed hall 一个挤满了人的大厅，这里的意思是一大厅的人都在学…",

          "description": "背景：\n楼主是广东某双非本科大三学生，现在的专业是电子商务，自知前途一般，所以也在找别的出路。从大一开始有同学带着做机器学习相关的竞赛，从那时候开始入门，然后开始接触数据分析、数据挖掘这方面的之后，发现对这些比较感兴趣后，就开始自己多去接触学习了这方面的知识，西瓜书、花书也买来看过，基本的机器学习算法模型是了解的，XGBoost 、LGBM 、yolo 之类的模型、算法，虽说原理没有仔细钻研过，不过该调包该调参还是会的，会主动学习新领域的知识，所以在这三年也打过几个比赛，至于结果的话，只有一两个成绩能拿的出手😭。\n考研\n从上面背景也可以看出，楼主也是想吃数据分析、数据科学这方面的饭的，了解过数分岗位的话对于学历要求可能没有数据挖掘、算法开发岗这么高，当然薪酬对应也相对低一点。\n考虑到岗位的要求、本身专业的限制以及楼主可能更想赚点小钱钱，所以也是从去年开始就准备考暨南大学应用统计的研究生（当然我也了解到，如果要搞算法岗的话，大概率非 92 不要，而且计算机硕可能更合适，不过这已经是楼主尽力摸高能到的相关专业）。\n但是说实话，目前也不太了解暨大的应统出来到底能不能跟我预期考研的目标匹配，如果有暨大应统的学长学姐解惑就最好了，感激不尽。\n考研的担忧\n楼主之所以考研有点忧虑，一是因为听到许多研究生毕业出来也难找工作，二是牛某网的等的论坛帖子中，对于本科拿到好工作 offer 后的建议也都是”推荐工作，没准考研后连现在待遇的 offer 都拿不到“的言论影响了判断，感觉考研上岸也不是一定会是正收益了。\n实习\n上网经常看见这种”想要考研上岸就不要想别的，整天担心忧虑自己考不上就一定考不上“这样的话，楼主对这些言论通常有点嗤之以鼻的态度，当然也可能因为没考过研，年轻气盛才不喜欢这种言论。但看现在的形势，考研越来越难，而且像是应用统计这个专业，叠加上这几年机器学习和 AI 的潮流，应统更是卷上加卷，而且我们学校电子商务专业的考研上岸率也低，大概只有 7%左右的样子，还都是本校考管科的研究生。这些情况也不得不让我担忧，为自己上不了岸准备后路，不至于一年过后的今天什么都没有。\n目前楼主没有实习经历，也就是这个原因，所以楼主担心在今年的秋招中可能会吃亏，到时秋招找不到工作保底，上岸上不了，直接双输。但是按楼主撰写这篇文章的时间（ 2024.6.6 ）的话，暑期实习可能也有点难找了，想要进好一点的公司也要靠熟人推荐碰碰运气，并且要花点时间来准备面试，这方面留给楼主抉择的时间也不多了，所以有点烦恼。\n楼主现在的抉择\n综合上面的考虑，目前楼主有两个不成熟的想法：\n偏向考研上岸的策略：不准备暑期实习+秋招准备一下简历面试看能不能找到一个保底工作+考暨大经济学院下的应用统计\n偏向拿到工作的策略：想办法找暑期实习看能不能凑出一段实习经历+带着实习经历去秋招+考暨南大学信息科学技术学院下的应用统计\n\"why\"：为什么一个考经济学院下的应统，一个考信息科学技术学院的应统\n是因为两个学院下应统的考研难度不同：信息院难度>经济学研的难度。\n根据楼主想要去的岗位要求，不仅要求学历而且最好有相关的科研产出的话，信息院无疑是要比经济学院要好的，而且也不愿意到时读了两年偏经济的应统硕，没什么相关的论文，最后与岗位的其他人没有竞争优势，浪费两年时间就更亏了。\n所以如何按策略 2 能够稳工作的话，就冲一冲更好的，如何工作不稳的话，就按策略 1 来，起码考研能稳一点，不知道我的想法对不对。\n楼主信息还是闭塞，希望 v 友们对我的规划提提意见，如果有相关数分、数据类岗位的要求、真实的需求现状之类的信息能分享就感激不尽了，如果有暨大应统的学长学姐可以交流就更感动了，第一次发帖希望说的清楚一点，所以废话有点多，v 友多包含。",

The second needs to be a RAW partition of a size large enough to hold the HFS+ image for the recovery environment (usually 1GB or more). It is important that it is a RAW partition, as MakeInstall uses dd to write the contents of the BaseSystem.dmg to the partition - and Windows cannot natively read/write HFS+ - so it needs a blank canvas per se for that data.\n-CorpNewt\n我问题来了，第一个 200MB 分区很容易创建，但是使用 diskgenius 却找不到如何创建“RAW 分区”选项，大家是如何创建这种分区呢？",

          "description": "过敏性支气管哮喘，简称“哮喘”，是发病率最高的慢性呼吸道疾病之一，影响着全球超过 3 亿人，每年约 25 万人死于哮喘。在哮喘发作期，患者常会咳嗽，严重时也可能发生喘息和呼吸困难，需要使用能快速扩张气道药物。\n引起哮喘发作的因素有很多。作为一种过敏性疾病，哮喘发作可以被很多吸入性过敏原触发，例如花粉、尘螨、蟑螂分泌物等。此外，感冒病毒等呼吸道感染，烟草烟雾、香水、空气污染等刺激物可能引起哮喘发作。甚至，哭泣或大笑也可能导致有些人哮喘发作。\n对于重度哮喘患者来说，发作的频率远高于轻度哮喘患者。频繁哮喘发作导致生活质量不断下降。为了减轻这部分患者的巨大负担，医药开发人员正在致力于开发长效疗法，让患者只需一次用药就能长期缓解病情。\n近日，清华大学彭敏研究员带领的团队设计了一种利用 CAR-T 细胞治疗哮喘的潜在新疗法。根据他们刚刚发表在《自然-免疫学》上的动物实验结果，过敏性哮喘小鼠接受一次注射后，哮喘的迹象和症状可以得到长期抑制。\n说到 CAR-T 细胞，大家对于这种疗法在癌症领域的应用或许已经不陌生。T 细胞经过基因工程改造后，装上了嵌合抗原受体（即 CAR ）后，就有了定位到肿瘤附近的导航，可以有效识别癌细胞并将其清除。这种免疫疗法已经在治疗血液肿瘤方面取得了显著的成功。\n而在新研究中，CAR-T 细胞装上的导航会把它们带到嗜酸性粒细胞细胞附近将其清除。嗜酸性粒细胞是非常重要的炎症效应细胞，在哮喘患者的气道高反应性及气道重塑的病理改变中起到重要作用。研究显示，具有嗜酸性粒细胞表型的重度哮喘患者，发生严重急性发作的风险超过了普通重度哮喘患者。\n经过研究人员的设计，这些 CAR-T 细胞靶向嗜酸性粒细胞表面的 IL-5 受体，以便免疫系统清除嗜酸性粒细胞。不仅如此，这些 CAR-T 细胞还会分泌一种 IL-4 突变蛋白，让突变蛋白阻断 IL-4 和 IL-3 的信号转导，从而避免这两种细胞因子在患者气道引起炎症和气道重塑。\n研究人员在过敏性哮喘小鼠模型中测试了这种 CAR-T 疗法，发现只需单次注射，就能持续抑制肺部炎症并缓解哮喘症状。此外，这些 CAR-T 细胞被发现能维持至少一年，在此期间持续防止过敏性免疫反应。\n论文总结说，这些临床前数据表明，一剂长效 CAR-T 有望实现哮喘的长期缓解。不过，这种潜在的新疗法还需要通过进一步的临床试验，测试是否对过敏性哮喘人类患者安全有效。",

          "description": "设想一个场景，你开一家公司，通过销售二次开发/魔改 GPL 产品来盈利，比如 Linux ，MySQL 等等。你不希望你的产品及源码被客户二次分发，也不希望你的产品被“非授权”使用。但是根据 GPL 协议，你必须向得到了 Binary 的客户提供源码，同时根据 GPL 协议，你的客户有权二次分发和传播 Binary 和源码。\n但 GPL 管不了 GPL 以外的其它协议/合同，因此在向客户提供产品之间，完全可以签订另一个协议：虽然根据 GPL 协议你有权二次分发 binary 和源码，你可以这么做，但是一旦你行使这项 GPL 权利，我们的所有合作就此终止，以后不再提供产品和更新及其源码，并且不退款，并且不再合作，说白就是撕破脸。\n这样使得客户“不敢”去公开/二次分发你的源码以及 binary ，或者说能开，但只能开一次。然后实际上你就能光明正大的“销售”GPL 产品了，并且这份源码（包括产品 binary 本身）并不会真正的被公开，实际上一直处于私密状态，尽管你的客户能够得到它。对于其它人而言，也必须要向你付费才能得到及使用产品。\n如果你的产品或源码还是被流传出去了，未向你付费的人使用泄露出去的版本法理上应该也不算盗版，没有法律上的风险，因为根据 GPL 协议他有权使用。但是假设你的公司影响力足够大，比如是某些国际大厂，产品涵盖很多领域，跟客户在不同领域均有合作，那么假如在其它领域（非 GPL ）的产品和客户的协议有一项条款：如果未与本公司签订协议/付费而使用 XX 系列产品，公司将有权终止所有合作关系。说白就是你能用，你也有权用，在这方面没法追究你，但是就跟你撕破脸了，咱家别的东西你以后都别想买了。\n这些条款对个人用户没啥意义，但对于企业尤其是大企业，还是会考虑其中的“风险”的。其实这也基本符合现在很多大厂产品的营销策略：对个人用户“免费”（不管是放任盗版，还是像最近 VMware workstation 那样直接宣布对个人免费），对商用收费。\n不知各位有什么看法？不知道红帽在“闭源”Linux 后是不是/有没有用类似的策略来限制自家源码以及 RHEL 兼容产物（类似之前的 CentOS ）的传播？",

          "description": "问题是什么？\n作为前 GitLab 架构师，我深知一个困扰大家很久的问题：就是代码没有有效、可读、可快速获取的注释。代码没注释，读得就慢。读得越慢，写得越慢。具体有这些表现：\n程序员需要阅读优秀的开源项目代码，但996 的工作时间让这变得困难。\n自己写的代码没有注释，几年后再看不懂，增加新功能时需重新理解。\n阅读他人的旧代码尤其是混乱的代码库，耗时且令人沮丧，但项目需求不得不读。\n给别人解释代码比较耗时。有时希望有一个工具来自动完成这个任务，帮助同事或者网友理解代码。\nCyberGit 的诞生\n作为这个领域从业者，我很早就开始使用 copilot 和类似的工具。不过 copilot 和国内数十家竞品工具都没有很人性化的解决读代码的问题。\n所以就自己做吧!\n就这样，CyberGit 诞生了。\nCyberGit 首先会对于项目进行工程化的分析，再使用 AI 和 Agents 进行代码解释，提高了注释准确率。还有以下特点：\n交互设计优化，切换文件的时候自动获取到按类、方法、函数划分的代码注释。\n注释内容做到更准确的压缩，一目十行读代码。\n并且 hover 到对应元素上才显示，不侵犯程序员的代码空间，不影响 commits，给程序员同学们丝滑的代码阅读体验。\n如何使用\n有兴趣的同学们可以在 https://cybergit.cn 注册使用。现在注册有 500 万 token 赠送。\n使用指导见以下文档： https://jxqetf736zs.feishu.cn/wiki/SZgPwq234ij3DAk0GAEcHfY0nNe\nCAVEATS\n由于时间原因，目前暂时只上线了 Java 和 Python 的分析，其他语言也在紧锣密鼓开发中。敬请期待。\n同样由于时间原因，目前只上线了 vscode ，如果大家喜欢，后续可以考虑 Idea 系列的编辑器。",

          "description": "背景：\n最近准备 618 换个冰箱：14 年前买的老冰箱，存储不够，经常出水，急冻结满了厚厚的冰，新房子预留的空间够大：宽 97cmX 深 74cmX228cm ，家里两个人。\n预算：不超过 15000 。\n款式：确定法式开门，内嵌不内嵌无所谓，容量 450-500L 就行了。\n品牌与爱好：不迷信任何品牌，只看中性价比，非常担心被收智商税。\n查询了很多资料，突然发现，买冰箱跟买车一样难了，这个行业鱼龙混杂的，越来越迷茫了！\n目前的主要困惑：\n1 ，冰箱最基本的低温储藏，似乎各家都有什么看家本领核心技术，比如西门子的零度 plus 保鲜，美的微晶保鲜，松下-3°，海尔全空间保鲜等等，似乎没有搭载各家品牌的拿手保鲜技术就不算买这个牌子了。\n但是另一个极端，这些都是些唬人的智商税，最基本的就是食材放保鲜膜、塑料袋就行了，而且应该尽量吃新鲜，避免放久了再吃的不健康生活习惯。\n\n2 ，高端的差异化\n制冰功能似乎很多人喜欢，随时有冰块，做冷饮冰沙等，有些牌子比如卡萨帝接近万元的都没这功能。\n另一个极端说是比如制冰机，冰箱不专业，加了这个功能要贵几千块。\n主动与被动杀菌：一个极端说是要选择主动杀菌的，健康着想，另一个极端说这又是智商税，没啥用。食材放塑料袋，保鲜膜保鲜盒，根本没这样的事儿，定期清洗一下冰箱比什么杀菌都强。\n\n3 ，我自己的选择：\n高端冰箱看好了一款：东芝大白桃 479 ，价格在 12000 左右，基本上要的什么功能都有了。\nhttps://item.jd.com/10043788830914.html \n中低端挑了一款，美的 508 ，参考价格 3600\nhttps://item.jd.com/100007351130.html \n平替青春版姊妹款华凌 526 ，参考价格 2600 。（华凌被美的收购，定位比美的低端一点）\nhttps://item.jd.com/10091332297851.html \n\n我现在就有点纠结，要么就一步到位选东芝这款 479 得了，高大上。要么就 low 到底，选华凌 526 ，价格便宜。\n从来没买东西这样，极端选品，所以现在比较纠结，选东芝担心一万多买个智商税，选华凌又担心低端，享受不到那些所谓的高端功能，以及制冰自由？\n所以，各位彦祖，有啥看法？",

          "description": "Devlog #001: 序言\n一个游戏开发爱好者的追梦之旅~\n持续更新: https://techartlife.com/gamedev/devlog/day-001\n作为一个游戏开发爱好者，我一直有个梦想：开发一个完整的游戏项目并上线。\n最近刚好有个契机，所以我决定正式开始制作游戏，也就是这个从零开始制作游戏项目。\n作为一个 从零开始 的项目，可想而知，其开发周期会非常长、涉及的领域也会非常多。所以，我打算把开发过程记录下来，整理成一个开发日志专题。我将在这里记录如何从零开始制作一个 3D 游戏，初步预期游戏类型是生存类模拟经营游戏，可能类似饥荒。\n作为一个从零开始的项目，我们会逐渐从 2D 项目一步步推进，逐渐过渡到 3D 项目的开发中。另外，作为一个 Hobby Project ，本项目的开发过程也可能与实际的游戏项目开发流程存在较大差异，望知悉。\n🌟欢迎催更🌟 \n本项目是我的爱好项目(Hobby Project)，内容选题方向和进度推进主要由个人兴趣驱动。\n当然，如果你对本项目非常感兴趣，也可以通过订阅 Patreon 支持来催更😛。\n主要内容\n我将在这里展示游戏在不同阶段的开发结果，预计包含的主题有：\n游戏引擎开发: Game Engine Development\n计算机图形学: Computer Graphics\n多人联机: Multiplayer Online\nPyGame 框架\n游戏引擎选择\n目前比较流行的游戏引擎有 Unity3D/Unreal/Godot/Cocos 等，这些游戏引擎一般功能模块都比较全，但是各个模块的封装度比较高、体量比较大，即使有源码也不方便修改。\n既然要从零开始制作游戏，干脆直接一点顺便从引擎开始做。为了避免在一些繁琐的操作系统差异(Windows/MacOS)和各种渲染 API 差异（ OpenGL/Vulkan/Direct3D/Metal ）上浪费不必要的时间，我选择在 PyGame 框架的基础上搭建整个项目。如果中途遇到有其他合适的通用系统模块（例如物理引擎模块），到时候也将考虑直接使用。\n🌟从引擎开始制作游戏🌟 \n不同于 Unity/Unreal/Godot\n引擎的主要定位是为具体的游戏玩法提供底层支持。\n:::\n游戏类型\n常见的热门游戏类型主要有：\n🌟模拟经营\n🌟生存建造\nFPS/TPS\nMoba\n经典游戏\n这个项目预计会先从 2D 游戏开始，逐渐过渡到 3D 游戏。\n脚本语言\nLua\n🌟 Python\nJavaScript\nC#\n为什么选择 Python ?\n通用型脚本语言，生态丰富。\nSimple and Efficient.\n系统支持\n为了简化发布和测试流程，在核心玩法稳定之前，我们的主要目标是保证 PC 平台可玩。\nWindows 10/11\nMacOS\n参考资料\nhttps://www.python.org/\nhttps://www.pygame.org/\n备注\n持续更新链接: https://techartlife.com/gamedev/devlog/day-001\n欢迎大家关注&交流~",

          "description": "就是常见的飞书文档钉钉文档那套东西，不过不用 OT ，用 CRDT 来实现协同，最近调研的社区最火的 yjs 。\n但发现用 yjs 做版本恢复的话，要把所有的 update 都存下来，yjs 的 snapshot 存的只是 ydoc 某个时间点的版本坐标，没有数据，要想用 snapshot 还原版本，还得把之前所有的 update 存下来，初始化的时候全部取出来一个个 applyUpdate ，把本地的 ydoc 还原到之前最新的状态，之后才能用 snapshot 回溯到某个版本。\n后端 websocket 网络层用了社区的 hocuspocus ，问题是每个字符的改变 onchange 方法里都会生成一个 update ，如果文档有几万字，就至少有几万个 update(还有段落啥的特殊字符)，这样前端还原 ydoc 的时候这里接口都要返回几万条 update 数据前端一个个 applyUpdate 也太不合理了。像 OT 恢复版本取得是最近的一个快照和后面的 update 数据，问题 yjs 的快照只存的是坐标，想请教一下这块优化怎么处理的好？是不是 yjs 也定期 flush 一下把之前 update 手动合并一下？但 yjs 并没有相关的 api ，只能从结构上表面上合并成数组，返回给前端的数据条数上减少一点。\n或者想听听各位对 yjs 做协同这块版本历史怎么实践的，网上这块资料基本为 0 。",

          "description": "我知道 Python 本身是强类型的，而且非常强。标题里的强类型是指能够“锁住”动态类型的情况。\n通常我们用 Python 开发工具时都是很享受动态类型的便利性和开发速度的，随着 3.6 开始添加 typehints ，慢慢地，类型系统也在向类 typescript 迁移。我个人是完全不喜欢把 python 写成 java 的写法的，无限的类型约束加上死板的写法，以及强行实现的毫无必要的设计模式，我感觉这是纯脑瘫行为。但是我欣然接受在关键节点、关键组件和关键模块引入严格的类型检查，以我的经验来看可以有效减少开发过程中 bug 产生。\n举例来说就是，python 的灵活性让我们可以向任意变量传入任意类型，如果想传入固定数据结构，可以通过注释约束，但没有解释器保障。往往我们推崇防御性编程，实际参与多人项目提交代码时，如果传入复杂结构就需要进行多重校验，以确保程序执行正常。\npersons = [\n\t{\n    \t\"姓名\": \"张三\",\n        \"年龄\": 19\n    }\n]\n\n例如如果想编写一个函数接受上述输入，防御性的写法可能是\ndef func(persons: list[...]):\n    if not persons:\n        return ... # err1\n    person_one = persons.pop(0)\n    age = person_one.get(\"年龄\")\n    if age is None:\n        return ... # err2\n    # else\n    ... # 业务逻辑\n\n加入以上大段代码，可以在发生手抖输入错误，数据清洗不到位，或者程序未知细节处产生未知行为时让函数仍然符合设计工作。缺点可能是行数太多，说实话也完全丧失了灵活性优势。\n我寻思既然已经 2024 年了，typehints 用来描述类型倒是没啥问题。问题是现在社区出没出什么方案，可以在编译器或者运行时阶段检查输入和输出两个节点，把函数掐头去尾一下，我感觉 bug 都会少很多。\nfrom typing import List, TypedDict\n\nclass Person(TypedDict)\n    name: str\n    age: int\n\ndef func(persons: List[Person]):\n    age = persons.pop(0).get(\"age\") + 1\n    return ...\n\n不知道有没有什么东西能实现上述效果，可以结合 typing 确保输入类型准确，避开检查代码的。目前。目前来说上面这套写法只有解释器检查，在动态的过程中没办法做任何检查，也就是说如果三方库，或者自己写的代码有 bug ，导致了任何的意料外行为时没有办法起到任何的防御性作用，debug 又是地狱了。",

          "description": "2024 ，0513-0519 ，第 20 周\n这周五，一个四年前定下的提醒事项弹了出来，是极简时钟最早的一个域名到期了。\n这个域名绑定的就是极简时钟的静态 landing page ，自打上线后我好像就没动过，导致我都忘了这个页面是 host 在哪里，通过反查 DNS 才知道是一个 GitHub page……\n2020 年正是极简时钟的快速上升期，那时候也有样学样地买了个域名，在网上找了个模板就把这个 landing page 完成了。至于这四年有多少访问量，就无从得知了。\n\n本周开发\n极简日记 iOS\n更新了 v1.7.22 ，修复了导出图片中背景色的问题。要不是用户反馈我都没发现，在给日记中加入 material 背景后，导致导出的图片中半透明的效果全都变成了十分丑陋的灰色。\nGoogle Play 的支付问题\n发现 RevenueCat 的 dashboard 中有很多 0 元续费的订阅，每天都有好几笔，一开始我还以为 app 里有 bug 导致用户可以零元购了呢，这下损失了好多啊。\n\n但是点进去一看，才知道原来是用户遇到了支付错误。在 RevenueCat 里筛选了一下，遇到支付问题的用户还不少，尤其是土耳其和东南亚居多。也不知道这个问题出在谁，是 Google Play 还是 RevenueCat ？\n\n\n又把服务器搞坏了\n一直想把国内安卓版的旧版支付 API 转发到新 API 上，这周终于有所行动了。\n先是在服务器代码上针对旧版 API 的参数做了兼容处理，然后在 nginx 添加了一条测试用的转发路径，最后部署新代码到服务器。\n本以为一都会很顺利，没想到还是出了问题，我发现正式环境里有两条付款记录没有生成对应的会员记录。经过一番排查，才发现是我画蛇添足，新建会员记录的 SQL 里添加了一个不存在的 field ，导致插入数据失败。这个插入操作是只有在收到微信支付的回调后才会执行的，而偏偏这一点我没测试到。保险起见，我就回滚代码了，那两个会员记录我也只好手动录入了。\n还好，只有两个。\n然而，第二天上午，我发现了数据库里又多了两笔 1 分钱的支付记录。我一开始还以为是安卓小哥在做测试，但是他说并没有……最终发现原来是我回滚代码的时候把价格的配置文件也给回滚了，所有的价格都恢复成了测试的价格，都是 1 分钱……偏巧有两个用户以 1 分钱解锁了原价 24 元的终身会员。\n还好，只有两个。\n本周减肥\n这周两次健身+游泳。周二游泳 1000 米游进了 40 分钟，周四的 1000 米又快了 2 分钟，38 分钟。单次连续游的距离也越来越长，最长可以连续游 300 米了。\n最近明显感觉所有裤子都肥了，都挂不住腰了。在南京旅游的时候还发现，上衣的尺码比之前小了一号。我还以为身体维度真的减小了，但是周日晚上用尺子一测，和之前的数据没有任何区别啊。\n体脂秤上的数据和 325 天之前对比，竟然一斤都没减掉，这令我很震惊。不过由于最近的运动，确实减掉了 9 斤脂肪，又增长了 9 斤肌肉，体脂率下降很多。\n\n本周开心\n这周读完了《认知觉醒》，收获颇多。说实话，这本书提到的诸多概念和行动指南，在其他书里也都有涉及，这本书本身也多次提到其他相关的书籍，比如《微习惯》《思考快与慢》《刻意练习》《心流》《暗时间》等等。但是，同样的道理，用这本书的作者周岭的话讲出来，不知道为什么，就令我感觉更好理解和接受，也解答了很多我关于拖延、焦虑、和自我提升上的困惑。\n\n还有一个，剑星，周四完成了一周目，周日完成了二周目和白金，一共花了 54 个小时。这是我买过最贵的一个游戏了，之前玩过 demo 版之后就果断下单了数位豪华版，也是我第一个玩了二周目的动作剧情类游戏。\n伊芙？衣服！在我看来，黑珍珠真的没意思，枉费大量时间和精力去舔图，还不如星球空降服原型。",

          "description": "2018 年我购买了人生中的第一台苹果设备 —— MacBook Pro 2018 ，作为陪伴我三年的 Dell Inspiron 7558 2-in-1 的继任者（时至今日，它依然是我最喜欢的笔记本电脑）。\n这台苹果笔记本在蒂姆·库克作为 Apple CEO 的时期内，“革命性”地采用了 OLED 显示屏、Touch Bar 和蝶式键盘，并在发布会上被大肆宣传。实际使用下来体验非常糟糕，Touch Bar 上的触摸功能键经常让我在调试程序时按错键，蝶式键盘特别容易出现按键粘连，作为不使用外置键盘的程序员来说，这简直就是灾难。而且不到两个月，OLED 屏幕四周就开始泛黄，烧屏。 这样的一台「库克制造」电脑在当时花费我两万块钱。而苹果糟糕的售后预约制度和（当时）动辄一周的维修时间让我放弃了维修的打算。\n后来 MacBook 终于移除备受争议的蝶式键盘。Touch Bar 是在 2021 年取消的，同时，库克居然把 iPhone 的刘海屏移植到 MacBook 上。也就是说，从 2015 至今，MacBook 用户至少要经历蝶式键盘、Touch Bar 或刘海屏，而我一次体验其中两种。\n作为苹果用户，我很难想象在库克的时期里，这十年来是如何做到每一代 MacBook 至少包含一种缺陷。制造一台基本完美的电子设备对一家市值常年世界第一的企业来说是否非常有挑战性？如果把库克当成一名商人，商人的目的就是贩卖商品，那库克一定非常出色的商人。库克时期以来制造的这些不完美的电子设备，甚至动用降频手段来刺激更新换代，把苹果的市值从几千万推到了最高三万亿。作为苹果用户，我一点也不喜欢库克。但从投资的角度来说，我又会用一套完全相反的说辞来说服自己购买苹果股票。2020 年我通过基金也间接重仓了苹果，见证苹果短短半年从 1 万亿涨到 2 万亿。\n苹果的库克时代在 2024 好像悄然翻篇，造车计划终止、错失 AI 时代、营收下滑、Vision Pro 销量不佳… 即使站在投资的角度我也很难再找到说服自己看多苹果的理由。\n库克时期内的苹果，充斥着商品的气味，缺乏划时代的创新。\n（文章写于 2024 年，使用 MacBook Pro 2018 ）\n转载于 https://vm0x00.com/posts/tim-cook @vm0x01",

          "description": "6月14日，华为官方微博“菊厂阿华”发布澄清声明：网传“华为是国内最大的牛肉进口商”纯属造谣，由此关联肉价波动、国际局势等，更属无稽之谈，请勿传勿信。\n\r\n\r\n据悉，近期网上流传多个与华为进口牛肉有关的传言，比如“华为是国内最大的牛肉进口商”；“华为牛肉主要进口自阿根廷，以惊人的66万吨牛肉进口量荣登中国最大牛肉进口商之位，占据了国内总进口量的十分之一”；“牛肉价格大跌，都是华为的锅”等等。\n\r\n\r\n目前这些传言基本都可以被权威数据证伪。\n\r\n\r\n比如根据中国商务部相关数据，2023年我国牛肉及其副产品进口前3大市场为巴西（约42.4%）、阿根廷（约19%）和澳大利亚（约8%），因此我国从阿根廷进口牛肉额并非最大。\n\r\n\r\n数据显示，2023年我国牛肉及其副产品进口数量约277.2万吨，金额约144.1亿美元（约1045.4亿人民币）。而知情人士向观察者网透露，华为2023年进口牛肉约100吨，约占全国进口总额的0.003%。\n\r\n\r\n公开能查询到的进口商排名数据为2018、2019年，行业非官方数据（近两年无），如2018年排名第一企业进口额32874.62吨，占进口总量3.66%，进入top30需要至少进口额占总额0.5%以上。\n\r\n\r\n来源：综合澎湃新闻，观察者网",

          "description": "电影《芳华》相比小说《芳华》有了不少修改，电影版对于两个主要人物刘峰和林丁丁都进行了美化，导致一些关键情节分析起来会出现完全不同的结论，下面的《芳华》人物分析仅仅针对电影版的剧情，不针对小说版的内容。本文将通过“功利主义”这种伦理学说，对电影《芳华》里的刘峰和林丁丁进行分析。\n\r\n\r\n功利主义是一种伦理学说，主张以实际功效或利益作为道德标准。功利主义的核心理念在于最大化整体幸福水平，是一种让绝大多数人的幸福最大化的伦理学说。功利主义的核心思想是追求“最大多数人的最大幸福”（最大幸福原则），即通过增加利益当事人的幸福来衡量行为的正确性。\n\r\n\r\n根据功利主义的观点，一种行为的道德性取决于其结果对于社会幸福的影响。功利主义者使用量化公式来判断一个行为的道德性，包括：受影响的人数: 一个行为影响的人越多，其影响就越大；幸福的程度: 一个行为带来的幸福程度越高，其价值就越高；幸福的持续时间: 一个行为带来的幸福持续时间越长，其价值就越高。\n\r\n\r\n对于“善与恶的标准”，功利主义的判断标准是看行为造成的结果，如果行为的结果符合大部分人的利益，就是善，如果行为的结果不符合大部分人的利益，就是恶。举例来说，利人利己的行为就是善行，损人不利己的行为就是恶行。\n\r\n\r\n刘峰\n\r\n\r\n刘峰进入文工团主要是因为跟头翻得好，后来做好事导致腰部受伤，刘峰成了闲人，就只能在文工团做一些杂事了，刘峰帮别人“做好事”，本质上是消耗自己的时间和精力，完成别人的工作，目的是为了获得好的名声，能成为学雷锋标兵。\n\r\n\r\n“活雷锋”这个名声也不是个好事情，他做的不少“好事”都是吃力不讨好的事情， 付出了很多劳动，却被别人当作“活雷锋”应该做的事情。\n\r\n\r\n如果从功利主义的角度看，刘峰所谓的“活雷锋做好事”，其实并不是做“善事”。\n\r\n\r\n善有几种，利人利己是大善，利人不利己和不利人利己都是小善，刘峰做的是“利人…",

          "description": "Steam账号被盗已经是很多玩家常见的问题了，盗号者往往将玩家的手机令牌、手机号、邮箱全都修改了，但即使这样，只要初始注册邮箱没有被盗，恢复找回账号其实并不难，下面讲述一下具体恢复过程。\n\r\n\r\n根据Steam官方提供的“恢复被盗走或劫持的 Steam 帐户”，如果被盗账户只是修改了密码，用户可以通过自助手段重置密码来恢复，如果被盗账户修改了邮箱、密码、手机令牌，那也不要怕，只要你的注册Steam邮箱没有被盗，Steam用户名还记得，基本上账号是100%找回。\n\r\n\r\n联系Steam客服时，Steam客服将验证帐户所有权，再恢复帐户。用户需要提供以下信息：\n\r\n\r\n1. Steam帐户登录名\n\r\n\r\n2. 注册Steam帐户的电子邮件地址和手机号\n\r\n\r\n3. 提供所有权证明\n\r\n\r\n所有权证明可提供该帐户以前的支付信息或通过Steam激活的产品代码来验证。\n\r\n\r\n如果用户使用信用卡在Steam上消费过，请在客服案件中提供以下信息：信用卡类型（Visa、MasterCard、Discover、American Express 等）；信用卡的注册名称；账单地址，包含城市和邮编；信用卡号末四位 - 请勿提供完整信用卡号。\n\r\n\r\n若用户曾使用支付宝在Steam上消费过，请在客服案件中提供以下信息：支付宝账户注册名称；提供支付宝支付记录中，最后一次在Steam平台帐户上进行的成功消费明细截屏，截屏请务必包含完整的商品交易编号、购买日期与金额。\n\r\n\r\n若用户曾使用微信支付在Steam上消费过，请在客服案件中提供以下信息：微信支付帐户注册名称；提供微信支付记录中，最后一次在Steam平台帐户上进行的成功消费明细截屏，截屏请务必包含完整的商品交易编号、购买日期与金额。\n\r\n\r\n用初始注册邮箱和手机提交一个客服案件，尽量用英文，描述的详细一些，一般快的话五个小时账号就能找回。\n\r\n\r\n英文不好的，可以先用中文写好，然后访问谷歌翻译或百度翻译，将内容翻译成英文，然后再用英文提交即可。\n\r\n\r\n至于财产损失方面基本不用担心，手机令牌、手机号、邮箱如果有一个被修改，Steam会暂停市场交易7天，防止用户的库存被出售，或者游戏被退款。如果用户及时提交客服案件，7天的时间是足够的。\n\r\n\r\n我之所以写这篇文章，是因为3周前，我自己的Steam账号有过一次被盗的经历，我的手机令牌、手机号、邮箱全都修改了，我提交客服案件并找回的全过程，只用了5个小时。以下是提交客服案件的内容，虽然提供的所有权证明不完善，但是由于我用的是初始注册邮箱联系，客服还是立刻帮我找回了账号。这里把相关过程记录一下，希望能帮助到其他人。​\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n这里我也批评一下Steam，Steam在游戏界也算是个知名大公司了，但是安全方面实在不敢恭维，骗子居然可以直接用好友的身份在Steam里发钓鱼链接，钓鱼网址竟然可以在Steam自己的系统里毫无障碍的传播，Steam竟然不对网址进行分析和过滤，这实在说不过去了。",

          "description": "这两天有篇文章很火，刷屏了社交媒体，文章标题叫《中文互联网正在加速崩塌》。文章内容主要讲的是，以前那个年代曾经红火过的中文网站的内容正在消失，中文互联网正在迅速崩塌，移动互联网出现之前的中文互联网内容，已经几乎消失殆尽。\n\r\n\r\n文章的作者举例，如果在百度上搜索“马云”这两个字，把时间设定在1998年到2005年，能搜出来的信息，大概有多少条呢？结果是1条。\n\r\n\r\n那么，事实到底是不是这样呢？下面，我们通过各种具体数据来分析一下。\n\r\n\r\n有个名为“Web Techmology Surveys”的网站，根据全球网站使用的语言，统计了从2013年到2024年这些年来，主要网站页面内容语言使用的历史趋势，从这个表格可以看出，中文网页的数量从2013年的4.3%降低到2024年的1.3%，十年间下降了70%，目前，全球的中文网页数量仅仅略高于印尼语和越南语，而低于波兰语和波斯语。\n\r\n\r\n从CNNIC发布的《中国互联网络发展状况统计报告》的数据上看，从2018年12月到2023年12月，中国的网站数量从544万个下降到388万个，五年时间内下降近30%，这一数据反映了中文网站数量减少的严峻形势。\n\r\n\r\n中国网民规模达10.92亿人，互联网普及率达76.4%，网民数占全球的19%，而中文网页的数量却在10年间下降了70%，中文网站数量在5年间下降了30%，这的确说明，中文内容网站正在迅速减少，并逐步消亡。\n\r\n\r\nHistorical yearly trends in the usage statistics of content languages for websites\n\r\n\r\nThis report shows the historical trends in the usage of the top content languages since January 20…",
