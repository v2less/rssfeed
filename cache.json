          "description": "Love is magic, it defies explanation. To the most rational and logical among us, this may be confusing. Its elusiveness is its significance. Love isn’t an illusion to be broken, but a miracle to bask in. Not everything needs to be understood to be appreciated. You are the audience, and the magician.\nLove is an idea. A moment of love can be forgotten but it can never be destroyed. It will be inscribed in time forever. Like an idea, love can exist long after death. Love lives simply by being conjured in the mind. Its abundance can be infinite.\nLove is a feeling, a swell of pure causality. It spawns cascades of events. You know it when you feel it. This feeling makes you think things, say things, do things, that otherwise would have never happened.\nLove is action. It is possible to convert irreplaceable resources into love. Time, will, energy — units of life. Every day you are given these raw elements to work with. These building blocks can be turned into an ethereal structure that is stronger, more solid, and more durable than any physical material.\nLove is freedom. It is unwise for trapeze artists to learn how to defy death without a safety net. Love gives you the freedom to explore the weirdest corners of your soul, your most peculiar ambitions. To love someone is to give them the freedom to become themselves, because they know you be there if they fall.\nLove is fear. The more you love someone, the more you may become afraid to lose them. But you must never let that fear stop you from loving someone as much as you possibly can.",

What happens in the background can essentially be explained this way: It launches a local shell process like cmd, sh, etc. and in it executes a command that opens a remote shell connection such as ssh user@host. All communication is then done through the stdin/stdout/stderr of that process. From there, it detects what kind of server and environmen…",

Furthermore, recreating existing figures that are not stored in formats preserving semantic information is equally complex. To tackle this problem, we introduce DeTikZify, a novel multimodal language model that automatically synthesizes scientific figures as semantics-preserving TikZ graphics programs based on sketches and existing figures. We also introduce a Monte Carlo Tree Search-based inference algorithm that enables DeTikZify to iteratively refine its outputs without the need for additional training.\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40596711\nPoints: 81\n# Comments: 7",

It is a powerful Photoshop-like editor that speeds up comic creation 10x with AI. The editor provides consistency and granular artistic control.

The original Lungy is a breathing app available for iOS, that uses real-time breathing with interactive visuals.\nThe cloth sim is a Verlet integration, running on a regular grid. For now, I have tried a couple of different cloth scenes - a sort of touch reactive 'pad', where different parts of the cloth are mapped to different sounds and a cloth that blows in sync with breathing. The collision detection is a little bit tricky with the deforming mesh, but seems to work ok overall. Overall, it seems like a cool interaction to explore.\nThe cloth sim is live on the app store now (and free) - would love to hear feedback from anyone with a Vision Pro.\nApp Store (Vision Pro): https://apps.apple.com/app/id6470201263\nLungy, original for iOS - https://apps.apple.com/app/id1545223887\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40539800\nPoints: 30\n# Comments: 17",

Oriole will automatically backup the data to Tigris using background workers.\nI wouldn't recommend using this in production, but I think it's in a good spot to provoke some discussion and ideas. You can get it running on your own machine with the steps provided - connecting to a remote Tigris bucket (can also be an AWS S3 bucket).\n[0] https://fly.io\n[1] https://www.orioledb.com/\n[2] Oriole Experiemental s3: https://www.orioledb.com/docs/usage/decoupled-storage\n[3] Tigris: https://www.tigrisdata.com/\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40514089\nPoints: 65\n# Comments: 17",

If you've got suggestions, give them even if you aren't 100% sure.\nThe brevity part is seemingly completely ignored. The lecturing part is hit or miss. The suggestions part I still usually have to coax it into giving me.\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40474716\nPoints: 59\n# Comments: 42",

          "description": "Hi HN, I’m excited to share Spot, a simple, cross-platform, React-like GUI library for Go. It is just a few days old and has lots of missing features but I'm happy with the results so far, and looking for some design feedback.\nSpot is designed to be easy to use and provide a consistent API across different platforms (mainly Mac & Linux). It’s inspired by React, but written in Go, aiming to combine the best of both worlds: the easy tooling & performance of Go with a modern, reactive approach to UI development.\nKey features:\n- Cross-platform: Leveraging FLTK[1] & Cocoa[2], Spot works on Mac, Linux, and the BSDs with plans for native Windows support in the future.\n- Reactive UI: Adopts a React-like model for building UIs, making it intuitive for those familiar with reactive frameworks.\n- Traditional, native widget set: Utilizes native widgets where available to provide a more traditional look and feel.\nWhy I built it:\nI was searching for a cross-platform GUI toolkit for Go that had a more traditional appearance, and none of the existing options quite met my needs. I then started playing with Gocoa and go-fltk and suddenly I worked on an experiment to see how challenging it would be to build something like React in Go, and it kinda evolved into Spot. ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯\nIn 2024, is there a still place for classic desktop GUIs—even with a modern spin?\nI’d love to hear your thoughts, feedback, and any suggestions for improvement. Also, contributions are very welcome.\nThank you for checking it out!\n[1] https://github.com/pwiecz/go-fltk\n[2] https://github.com/roblillack/gocoa\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40469592\nPoints: 60\n# Comments: 9",

          "description": "Hey HN, I am the founder of Tensorlake. Prototyping LLM applications have become a lot easier, building decision making LLM applications that work on constantly updating data is still very challenging in production settings. The systems engineering problems that we have seen people face are -\n1. Reliably process ingested content in real time if the application is sensitive to freshness of information. \n2. Being able to bring in any kind of model, and run different parts of the pipeline on GPUs and CPUs.\n3. Fault Tolerance to ingestion spike, compute infrastructure failure.\n4. Scaling compute, reads and writes as data volume grows.\nWe are built and open sourced Indexify(https://github.com/tensorlakeai/indexify), to provide a compute engine and data frameworks to LLM applications that work o…",

Porter Cloud (https://porter.run/porter-cloud) is a Platform as a Service (PaaS) like Heroku, but we make it easy for you to migrate to AWS, Azure, or GCP when you're ready.\nLike Heroku, Porter takes care of a lot of generic DevOps work for you (like setting up CI/CD, containerizing your applications, autoscaling, SSL certificates, setting up a reverse proxy) and lets you deploy your apps with a few clicks — saving you a lot of time while developing. However, as you probably know, there’s a downside: platforms like this become constraining if and when your app takes off and you need to scale.

Neosync is an open source platform that helps developers anonymize production data, generate synthetic data and sync it across their environments for better testing, debugging and developer experience.\nMost developers and teams have some version of a database seed script that creates some mock data for their local and stage databases. The problem is that production data is messy and it’s very difficult to replicate that with mock data. This causes two big problems for developers.\nThe first problem is that features seem to work locally/stage but have bugs and edge cases in production because the seed data you used to develop against was not representative of production data.\n…",

We've successfully utilized it in genomics to associate billions of \"k-mers\" with taxonomic identifiers while maintaining an efficient memory footprint. But the data structure is also useful beyond computational biology, particularly where you have large unique key domains and constrained value ranges.\nAvailable under an Apache 2 license.

However, property-based testing is not as widely used as in other languages such as Haskell or Elixir, and I think this is because there is no de facto testing tool.\nThis gem currently not only has the basic functionality of stateless property-based testing but also has the following features:\n- Support verbose mode that allows you to see its shrinking procedure and algorithms.\n- Support several concurrency/parallel executions of each test. As of now, Ractor/Thread/Process are available. (The default is sequential, considering benchmark results and actual use cases)\nHappy hacking!\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40441093\nPoints: 150\n# Comments: 17",

So I digitised it. It comes with a few cool features like resource conversions (e.g. converting plants to greenery), production phase, offline, mobile-friendly and keeps track of the history using the browser history itself.

The Apple Photos app also only supports photos in your iCloud.\nDesktop Docs supports adding folders or individual files to an AI Library where you can search by the contents of your files, not just file titles.\nYou can search by objects (\"cardboard box\"), actions (\"man smiling\", \"car driving\"), by emotion (\"surprised woman\", \"sad cowboy\"), or the text in the frame (great for screenshots or memes).\nIt's also 100% private. Make any media searchable without it ever leaving your computer.\nHow I built it:\n- 100% Javascript (I'm using Electron JS and React JS).\n- Embedding generation (CLIP from OpenAI is used to compute the image embeddings and text embeddings for user queries).\n- Redis (storing and doing KNN search on the embeddings with this DB).\n- Image/video editing (the app ships with FFmpeg binaries to explode videos into individual frames and scale images).\nDemo: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EIUgPNHOKKc\nIf there are any features you'd like to see in Desktop Docs or want to learn more about how I built it, drop me a comment below.

          "description": "Hey HN! I built a tool that gives LLMs the ability to understand the visual structure of a webpage even if they don't accept image input. We've found that unimodal GPT-4 + Tarsier's textual webpage representation consistently beats multimodal GPT-4V/4o + webpage screenshot by 10-20%, probably because multimodal LLMs still aren't as performant as they're hyped to be.\nOver the course of experimenting with pruned HTML, accessibility trees, and other perception systems for web agents, we've iterated on Tarsier's components to maximize downstream agent/codegen performance.\nHere's the Tarsier pipeline in a nutshell:\n1. tag interactable elements with IDs for the LLM to act upon & grab a full-sized webpage screenshot\n2. for text-only LLMs, run OCR on the screenshot & convert it to whitespace-structured text (this is the coolest part imo)\n3. map LLM intents back to actions on elements in the browser via an ID-to-XPath dict\nHumans interact with the web through visually-rendered pages, and agents should too. We run Tarsier in production for thousands of web data extraction agents a day at Reworkd (https://reworkd.ai).\nBy the way, we're hiring backend/infra engineers with experience in compute-intensive distributed systems!\nhttps://reworkd.ai/careers\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40369319\nPoints: 119\n# Comments: 47",

          "description": "We are building Quary (https://quary.dev), an engineer-first BI/analytics product. You can find our repo at https://github.com/quarylabs/quary and our website at https://www.quary.dev/. There’s a demo video here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3hO65_lkGU\nAs engineers who have worked on data at startups and Amazon, we were frustrated by self-serve BI  tools. They seemed dumbed down and they always required us to abandon our local dev tools we know and love (e.g. copilot, git). For us and for everyone we speak to, they end up being a mess.\nBased on this, we decided there was a need for engineer-oriented BI and analytics software.\nQuary solves these pain points by bringing standard software practices (version control, testing, refactoring, ci/cd, open-source, etc.) to the BI and analytics workflow.\nWe integrate with many databases, but we’re showcasing our slick Supabase integration, because it: (1) keeps your data safe by running on your machine without data flowing through our servers; and (2) enables you to quickly build an analytics layer on top of your Supabase Postgres instances. Check out our Supabase guide: https://www.quary.dev/docs/quickstart-supabase\nWhat we’re launching today is open source under the Apache 2.0 license. We plan to keep the developer core open source and add paid features like a web platform to easily share data models (per-seat pricing), and an orchestration engine to materialize your data models.\nPlease try Quary at https://quary.dev and let us know what you think! We're excited to put the power of BI and analytics into the hands of engineers.\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40367090\nPoints: 138\n# Comments: 34",

          "description": "I've been obsessed for the past ~year with the possibilities of talking to LLMs. I built a bunch of one-off prototypes, shared code on X, started a Meetup group in SF, and co-hosted a big hackathon. It turns out that there are a few low-level problems that everybody building conversational/real-time AI needs to solve on the way to building/shipping something that works well: low-latency media transport, echo cancellation, voice activity detection, phrase endpointing, pipelining data between models/services, handling voice interruptions, swapping out different models/services.\nOn the theory that something like a LlamaIndex or LangChain for real-time/conversational AI would be useful, a few of us started working on a Python library for voice (and multimodal) AI assistants/agents.\nSo ... Pipecat: a framework for building things like personal coaches, meeting assistants, story-telling toys for kids, customer support bots, virtual friends, and snarky social bots.\nMost of the core contributors to Pipecat so far work together at our day jobs. This has been a kind of \"20% time\" thing at our company. But we're serious about welcoming all contributions. We want Pipecat to support any and all models, services, transport layers, and infrastructure tooling. If you're interested in this stuff, please check it out and let us know what you think. Submit PRs. Become a maintainer. Join the Discord. Post cool stuff. Post funny stuff when your voice agent goes completely off the rails (as mine sometimes do).\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40345696\nPoints: 157\n# Comments: 23",

          "description": "Hi HN! I thought you might enjoy this even if you don't know much about Elixir.\n`es6_maps` is a small library that introduces a \"shorthand\" map creation syntax, similar to shorthand object construction in JavaScript/TypeScript. For those unfamiliar with Elixir, the most interesting aspect might be how it achieves this. `es6_maps` takes advantage of BEAM (Erlang's VM) hot-reload capabilities to amend the Elixir compiler bytecode at runtime, adding functions that expand the shorthand syntax for further compilation. I think it's a nice showcase of the power you can wield (with care) when writing in BEAM languages.\nLet me know what you think!\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40333500\nPoints: 56\n# Comments: 29",

          "description": "Howdy folk,\nI've been building this project as both a side project and my job for a little while now. The rationale behind it is while wireguard is a fantastic protocol cryptographically it leaves a lot to be desired when it comes to enrollment and end user device security.\nObviously instead of using an off the shelf solution like tailscale, I decided to reinvent the wheel which has honestly been quite fun with learning about eBPF, and recently clustering and HA with etcd!\nThe most recent version (in the docker container) contains about 6 months of very new work bringing it all from sqlite3 to etcd. So please be forgiving if it does some weird things!\nHope you all enjoy!\nP.s Im not a web developer and any tips on that front to make it less teeth pullingly awful are welcome!\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40326615\nPoints: 106\n# Comments: 29",

Like, sometimes I thought I included a screenshot, but the important information the engineer needed was what was actually right outside the boundary of the screenshot I took. Or I'd write that something \"didn't work\" but the engineer wasn't sure if I meant that it returned an error or if it was unresponsive. So the engineer would be frustrated, I would be frustrated, and fixing stuff would slow to a halt while we went back and forth to clarify…",

Here’s a demo video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ls6VRzBQ-pQ.\nSnowflake is one of the most widely used data warehouses today. It abstracts out the underlying compute infrastructure into “warehouses” for the user - compute units with t-shirt sizes (X-Small, Small, Medium etc.). In general, if you want to lower your data processing costs, the only thing you can do is to just process less data (i.e. query optimization). But Snowflake’s warehouse abstraction allows an extra dimension along which you can optimize - by minimizing the compute you need to process that same data (i.e. warehouse optimization). Baselit automates Snowflake warehouse optimization for you.\nWhile we were working on anot…",

          "description": "Because I saw many responses to the Windows Recall fiasco are just \"switch to Linux\" but then I realised that there's a big push not only for invasive no-one-asked always online AI stuff. But also in that the news ARM laptops are becoming more locked down, and even if you get to x86, Microsoft seems to plan for the addition of chips like Pluton that are worse than the Intel ME, and also blocks the booting of Linux.\n So it might be that Microsoft wants to force manufacturers to block Linux with \"security processors\" or ditching the standardised x86 and force a more smartphone model of hardware on computers. And if people says the EU is gonna fine them, for that kind of corps, fines are just another expense. In the US we already know the useless congresspeople are just paid by bribes, I mean lobbying. \n And even if that doesn't happen, the corporations and manufacturers could start to make computers more like phones (just look how the new Intel chips have LPDDR instead of CAMM or SODIMM) with nominally releasing a \"free kernel\" based on Linux but using a lot of permissive licenses for the OS and BLOB for the hardware just like phones. So while they benefit from Linux, they still have proprietary software controlling the important stuff.\n So could it be that in a couple of decades we could be forced to use locked down computers, or if we really want to use Linux, use outdated hardware or experimental and slow hardware?\n    submitted by    /u/DeltaAleph  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I've been a GNU+Linux user since the mid 90's (when I was a teenager) and I love retro computing. It's a hobby. Among my collection are the Radeon HD 3850 (both AGP and PCIE variants), the radeon HD 4670 (both the AGP and PCIE variants) and the highly sought after ALiveDual-eSATA2 motherboard. I have been waiting to test them (other than confirming that they work) until I had every part that I wanted for my test and finally I have the RAM sticks I was hunting for. However, I don't want to test with ancient Windows (or any Windows for that matter). I've been a Linux user since the mid 90's and that's what I love. However, I was vaguely aware that AGP support might have been stripped from the kernel or disabled or something. Is it still in the kernel source tree? Can AGP support be re-enabled so that I can get full performance from my graphics cards? Do I have to use older kernels? If so, what is the most recent kernel version that still has full AGP support and what is the most recent distro and distro-version that I can run that kernel with? I am a little annoyed that AGP support was removed. I know that the retro computing community is mostly Windows users, but I am a retro Linux users. There are dozens of us. DOZENS! Anyway, I hope that this message finds itself in the right hands and that someone can help me out. I would absolutely love to be able to run a bleeding edge Linux kernel and distro on my retro hardware with full functionality. Do we have to create a retro-specific distro or does such a thing already exist?\n    submitted by    /u/gnarlin  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Not a big thing really, but i thought i'd share.\n Part of my job is running Updates on customer systems with ansible. The includes 2 things: \"Initiate\" the Update by selecting an environment to work with (this ensures you don't have to attach the -i flag to every ansible-playbook command) and then running 4-6 playbooks. Additionally, i do \"custom\" rollouts with any subset out of 30 or so playbooks, which are all contained in a folder.\n I was growing tired of having to type the path to customer inventorys and autofilling playbook names. This is tedious and with playooks often having similar names, i tended to have to type them out almost completely.\n So today, i spend a grand total of 20 minutes putting together two scripts that pipe either the environments or playbooks into fzf and the runs the needed command. So i now get interactive fuzzy search through our customers and playbooks. All of that without having to get a software approved by IT and all done in 10 lines of bash total.\n This then also made me realize i can just push my entire ssh config with some grep and filtering into fzf to get an interactive \"ssh launcher\".\n So really, 30 minutes spend wipping up 3 scripts that will now make my job easier and nicer every day. And that's possible because so many awesome tools are made to \"just work\" with each other through text input and output. That's why i love working on Linux every day.\n    submitted by    /u/domsch1988  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I know that Linux has Optimus and Prime (lol) for managing integrated and dedicated graphics, but they just work for Nvidia and an iGPU, in some cases they can work for Radeon and iGPU, but they don't work if you have an integrated and dedicated Intel GPU, there is an official solution involving virtualization, but beside of being intended for Ubuntu 20 , it requires you to be a high knowledge power user and is probably obsolete. There is no other solution, I can't even choose to use discrete or dedicate graphics while booting with switcheroo nor in BIOS.\n I have an Intel i5 1135G7 with dedicated Intel Iris Xe Max, and linux always uses the dedicated graphics card, I wasted two full nights looking for a solution but nothing, two nights changing distros, installing packages, drivers, running commands I found on internet and nothing.\n Windows can Manage both GPUs so it gives me 8 or 9 hours of battery while idling or using light software, while Pop OS, Manjaro, and Ubuntu only can shrink 3 hours of idling, and like 40 minutes of gaming, the computer is always hot, and software can't monitor it's temperature, so I guess it just works until direct motherboard circuit regulates its temperature, staying at like 90 degree Celsius while playing simple things as Fran Bow, burning my lap.\n It makes me kinda sad that Nvidia being a completelly closed code GPU has better support that Intel, that in theory has all its drivers open for being inplemented on Linux, it can't even track the GPU temperature, I really like Linux for its simplicity, while Windows is more and more bloated everyday, but for my laptop I have no choice, 3 times better battery life and reasonable temperatures is a no brainer for my laptop battery health, i'm going to miss Linux.\n    submitted by    /u/Sit_and_forget  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I have been using Linux for about a year now and I have distro hopped a couple times and settled on Arch with KDE. Everything is fine but now I want to switch to a different flavor just for fun. \n So, I found the usual top 5 distro pages and visited the sites of a lot of distros like CachyOS, Endeavour, Kubuntu (last time i installed it had internet issues but ubuntu was fine miraculously. Some problem with the wifi power saving mode) etc.\n They had well maintained webpages and some looked better than even corporate websites I have seen. Although this could simply be that our community has much love for the creation of excellence, a part of me wondered if the maintainers of the distros could sneak in something that spied on us. \n Since many of these distros are not even that famous, how can I be sure that they obey actual internet laws?\n Have there been instances where misuse has occurred?\n How can I ensure what I am putting on my machine is safe?\n Is this paranoia a result of my misunderstanding of how distros are validated? \n    submitted by    /u/lifesocksss  \n [link]   [comments]",

And the great thing is that FOSS developers don't gatekeep their software from Windows/macOS (unlike the other way around), so they can install pretty much every free and open source software out there.\n How do I know this method works? Because it's how I fell in love with FOSS and Linux. I needed a way to remux a video file and all the options out there were paid. Until I came upon ffmpeg, which allowed you to not only remux video, but to do pretty much anything with it. It seemed too good for something that good to be free. That's when I looked into it and learned about free and open source software. After that I slowly switched all of my software to free and open source alternatives, until the only proprietary thing left on my PC was Windows itself.\n    submitted by    /u/crosspacelayer  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I've made a few comments now on setting up a computer with a swappable drive tray so one could switch between Linux and Windows and never have the two bump heads with one another.\n I did this back in the XP days and it worked beautifully. \n I had a hot swap drive bay in my PC and basically, when I ran Windows, I had the Windows hard drive in that bay. When I wanted to boot up Linux, I would pull out the Windows drive and slide in the Linux drive. The computer didn't care which drive was in it. It just booted whatever was on it.\n Today, I run Linux only. I've made the jump and removed Windows from my life forever. So I no longer need a hot swap drive system in my computer. I run Linux 24/7.\n But I think one can still use this technique of using a swappable drive bay. And with auto hard drive detection, it should be pretty simple to use 2 different sized drives. But, don't quote me on that. \n So, the best way to accomplish this feat is to get a second hard drive that is the same size/model as the one you already have. So, if you have a 1TB SSD from Western Digital, get a matching 1TB SSD drive from Western Digital. Same model (you might be able to get away with a different size drive but I'm playing it safe here).\n Then get a hot swap drive bay system for your computer. Something that will accommodate those 2 drives. Make sure it has at least 2 hot swap trays.\n Connect the hot swap bay to the computer and now you'll be able to swap between 2 different drives. One with Linux and one with Windows.\n You're going to have to shut down the computer to make the swap. Once the computer is off, swap the drives and power it back up and you should boot into the other.\n It's a pretty simple concept. It's much easier than shutting the computer down and taking the side panel off and swapping cables all the time. Just pull one out from the front of the computer and slide the other one in it's place and boot it up.\n Pretty simple really.\n    submitted by    /u/MarsDrums  \n [link]   [comments]",

The only rule is that you can't make me use a distro that is known spyware or malicious, etc. The most upvoted comment in the next little while (~3 Days probably) will be the distro I use for the next month.

          "description": "After installing Ubuntu 24.04 LTS, naturally I tried to install Steam with apt, to no avail. I decided to just install through the App Center. After that every Steam game not using OpenGL failed to open, but after opening Steam through terminal I realised it's because 'Steam could not initalize Vulkan' (or something to that effect). After a few hours of troubleshooting, thinking it was my drivers, or the Vulkan installation and considering just reinstalling the OS, I seen a post where someone said to reinstall Steam. After manually adding the repository and reinstalling it, lo and behold everything worked absolutely fine. I believe it's because installing it through apt, it installs 32-bit drivers that you don't get with the App Center version. This is a very dumbed down version of events, I was troubleshooting for a while.\n Perhaps it's my fault, I'm not sure. But, to my knowledge, I did what any typical user would do. Install OS - Update OS - Install drivers - Install Steam (through apt), which failed, so I chose to install through the App Center. So, I'm going to put fault on Ubuntu for this one.

          "description": "About 3 months ago, I posted this: https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/1b5yk9r/kde_plasma_6_how_many_of_you_are_thinking_of/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button\n Now, I can fully say that I've definitely switched from GNOME to KDE Plasma. Mind you, that I'm using NixOS Stable channel, so I only get Plasma 5.27, but even I'm well satisfied. I used GNOME for about 3 years, before switching to KDE Plasma.\n People say KDE Plasma is too much like Windows, it's too much customization, or it's too buggy. I can argue that GNOME isn't enough. It's great for simple users who don't want to customize anything, but over time, it became annoying that the DE had limits, which you could only modify if you added extensions.\n The only bugs I've seen are graphical glitches that causes some stuttering. But it's not really a deal breaker.\n Graphically, KDE Plasma is very impressive. There's a charming affect whenever this DE interacts with you. There's especially a lot \"fading\" effects, like pressing meta key, dragging different open windows, or opening things on the taskbar. But their selection of desktop backgrounds, even their \"start button,\" and even starting it up where it shows the Plasma icon; it's all so charming. Even their notification sounds are very distinguishable.\n Whereas in GNOME, you get some irrelevant sounds like \"dog bark\" or \"glass\" or \"pop\" sound. None of these sounds have style, nor are they memorable.\n It feels really nice when DEs not only make something nice and snappy, but also put some thought and effort into the branding. In GNOME, all you see is the \"activities\" corner, and that doesn't really help, and I can hardly remember the \"foot print\" logo.\n I do have to say, GNOME has made some very useful software that's hard to pass on: GNOME Disks and Disk Usage Analyzer to say the least. I still use some of the default GNOME programs in my systems.\n But overall, KDE Plasma is very impressive.\n    submitted by    /u/nPrevail  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "In case you didn't know, dotfiles were just an accident of history on Unix-based operating systems, they were never designed as a method for hiding files and directories. And it makes sense, because they're awful at it. Think about it, if you want to change the visibility of a file/directory, you have to rename it, which breaks all sorts of things, such as symbolic links and programs that expect a file/directory to be at a certain path.\n But what's a better solution? It would be so much better if there was simply a file attribute that modifies the visibility of a file/directory. In fact that's what macOS, Windows and (I'm pretty sure) even FreeBSD do.\n And before you say that dotfiles have an advantage of being easily identified as hidden files from the terminal, this too can be easily fixed, by simply modifying the ls command in such a way that it changes the color of the file name such that it identifies it as a hidden file, like it already does with executable files, which it colors as green.\n    submitted by    /u/crosspacelayer  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hi all,\n I am a university student, currently dual booting Linux and Windows on my laptop, at least while I transition from windows. One of the largest troubles I had at the start of using Linux was the lack of the Office 365 suite. I know the LibreOffice exists, but most things at university are shared as .pdf, .ppxt, or word, and not being able to quickly and accurately read and edit these documents is simply not okay. \n ​\n It feels like Microsoft is helping the transition to Linux by making the web version of these apps so good. Soon there will be no difference between the web app and desktop app in windows. In which case, Microsoft will have solved my largest sore spot when switching to Linux. I find this very funny, I don't know why they did this, I suppose because they see collaborative work taking off. I was curious to hear what you guys think, and if you use these apps as well, or do you live with the Libre suite?\n    submitted by    /u/coolbob74326  \n [link]   [comments]",

But the standard is vst and au. We have limited support, and the only good DAW we have is Reaper.\n Thats my opinion. But maybe you can tell me, what's your experience with music production and linux?

But this might get tricky when 4 and 5 are somewhat linked like with Jupyter notebooks (not sure if there’s better examples of such issues).

          "description": "It just takes following some simple steps. One, stick with reputable, mainstream hardware vendors who have a proven track record of working well with Linux.\n Two, stick with mainstream, reputable distros that have a proven track record of working well for users. Yes that means something like Mint is, for the vast majority of people, going to be a better choice than whatever the distro/TWM flavour of the week is.\n Three, STOP copying and pasting commands, scripts, whatever you found on the internet unless you actually understand what it's doing. So sick of people borking their systems following some \"guide\" only to then come on here and complain Linux sucks. Linux doesn't suck. You suck. Who gave you the power of sudo? :P\n Four, immutable distros like Silverblue or Aeon have promise, but right now the fact they rely on flatpaks is a major weak point, because flatpaks still often have problems with stability, or permissions issues. It's always improving, and I don't mean to hate at all, but IMHO, flatpak shouldn't be considered Mainstream just yet. Stick to your package manager as much as possible.\n And lastly, RTFM. No you shouldn't use PPAs with Debian. That's just one example. Stop expecting Linux to be Windows. It's not Windows. Just lke Mac isn't Windows. And don't expect WINE to work. Sometimes it does. Oftentimes it doesn't. \n K, I'm done now.\n -happy Linux \"average desktop user\" since 2010-ish :P\n (and don't forget to backup your home folder so when you ignore all this advice and break your system you don't lose all your personal files)\n edit: crossed out some stuff, because some others here pointed out it was needlessly snarky, and they were right to do so.

You'll see I'm not as tech-savvy as you guys, but I'm learning :)\n I have the laptop since 2020, and was struggling with space even though I've deleted basically everything I could from it. I thought those 40+gb I could never remove were from windows spyware bs so I was like \"xfce is lighter so it should just use like, 20gb instead of 40 idk\" (it doesn't make sense but back then I had no clue what was going on) however, mint couldn't erase the disk. I looked up my partitions for the first time ever and found the problem. I went back to windows but due to the bitlock, I couldn't format it, erase, nothing.\n I'm currently formatting the whole pc and man, I'm so tired. Apparently from what I read online there are more companies selling pre-bitlocked machines. Nevermind win 11 trying to push bitlock at install (I have win 10 tho) right now win10 is pushing its copilot ai.\n As for mint itself, I had zero problems with download, authenticity/integrity check and usb burn.

With that renewed interest, comes renewed hate toward the Linux desktop by people who feel personally confronted by the privacy + freedom oriented philosophy most Linux users subscribe to.\n \"Privacy doesn't matter to me\" is the common response.\n That is fine. What should matter to users is reliance. Plenty of potential Linux users forgoe the switch because their favorite big tech software doesn't run on Linux.\n \"I have built spreadsheets that don't open in LibreOffice/OpenOffice\"\n \"I need Adobe to edit pictures/create music/read my DRM protected books\"\n These are statements that should give you pause. Is it acceptable that you are reliant on a piece of software to the extent that it ties you to an operating system and set of apps that could be taken away from you at any second? Let us focus on the first statement; how much will you pay for Excel (either in cash or your privacy) so that you can continue editing your favorite spreadsheet? Is there a point at which you would force yourself to learn how to program or translate these spreadsheets into LibreOffice?\n You may not care about Privacy or Freedom, but Microsoft and Apple will at some point set a price that will have you wishing you were Independent.\n No one who switches to Linux should expect the transition to be easy. There will be quirks on your system that you will have to iron out and there are just fundamental differences between Windows and Linux that you will have to get used to. In other words you will need to learn. If you think that is a waste of time, that's fine. In my eyes, and in many others', learning a new skill is never a waste if time.\n I hope this provides a useful perspective.\n    submitted by    /u/wallbucks  \n [link]   [comments]",

Taking Adobe as an example, back in the day, maybe it wasn't as clear, but now it feels like there's no excuse not to support Linux.\n Linux offers strategic stability because of its culture and provides more predictability for software companies, something that should matter a lot to profit-driven businesses. Unlike Microsoft, which has often disregarded its users, Adobe could even go as far as creating their own Linux version if they wanted to be totally independent from other third parties to deliver their services. Though it may be tactically hard and resource-consuming, it's strategically beneficial for them in the long run—for them more than users, because the time will come when a real alterna…",

The installation would go smooth, but after logging in I couldn't for the life of me get anything to show up. For example I was able to fire up a terminal, execute commands perfectly fine, no errors at all. But starting some applications wouldn't work, they would show up in htop but I couldn't see them. I spent a day debugging this and installed ~5 different distros but still found no solution.\n Being done I got up from my computer, turned on my TV and saw my desktop on the TV. The computer was connected to the TV via HDMI and would make it a primary display despite it being turned off... Having 5 years of experience with Linux I started exploring drivers, looking into logs etc. and it didn't occur to me to check the connected displays.\n Do you have any stories with Linux where you turned out to be a complete idiot when in reality the solution was as simple as unplugging a cable?\n    submitted by    /u/Mrkaniclol  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hello everyone,\n I am excited to introduce my new project, kickstart.dotfiles, a Python-based tool designed to streamline the management of your dotfiles. You can fork or clone the repository, put your dotfiles there, and write linking configurations in a JSON format. After running the tool, your dotfiles are linked based on the provided configuration.\n Key Features:\n  \nClone Git Repositories: Easily clone specified Git repositories to desired directories, e.g. a separate nvim config.\n Symlink Creation: Automatically create symlinks for static files and folders.\n Template Management: Generate and link files from templates, supporting environment variable substitution, including base64-encoded values for multiline variables.\n Template Difference Checking: Compare generated files with template files to identify differences.\n Backup Existing Files: Backup existing files before overwriting them to ensure no data is lost.\n Dry-Run Mode: Preview the actions without making any changes to ensure everything is correct.\n  \nWhy Another Dotfiles Manager\n I needed a simple script to link my dotfiles from a git repo to the $HOME directory. I do not really like the idea of storing anything encrypted in the repo itself, as all my secrets are stored separately. Plus, I wanted something simple, without any dependencies - you just need environment variables with your secrets and the kickstart.dotfiles repository to set up everything.\n Example\n The repository provides a comprehensive example. See the bash script for some additional details:\n bash git clone https://github.com/Foat/kickstart.dotfiles.git cd kickstart.dotfiles ./example/run.sh --config ./example/config@linux.json \n Running the script: bash python kdf.py --config path/to/config.json [--dry-run] [--check-templates] \n Feel free to ask any questions, provide feedback, or contribute to the project.\n    submitted by    /u/Gippius  \n [link]   [comments]",

Distro packagers are now recommended to include `nouveau` in the `vulkan-drivers` list so that their users can have the option of using it instead of the proprietary NVIDIA driver. - Intel Vulkan driver Anv switched to truly asynchronous VM bind, and Xe support for error dump to debug GPU hangs was added. - Apple OpenGL driver Asahi has reached OpenGL 4.6 and OpenGL ES 3.2 support. - Broadcom Vulkan driver V3DV gained support for VK_KHR_dynamic_rendering. - Arm Mali OpenGL driver Panfrost was prepared for Gen10 (Gxxx), and Vulkan driver PanVK was modernised for better Midgard (Txxx) and Bifrost (Gxxx) support. - All Vulkan drivers have gained support for explicit synchronisation on Wayland and X11. \n    submitted by    /u/fenix0000000  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Here's what I believe Microsoft (and partners) have in store for the future: they are going all-in on pulling an Apple-style switch to ARM on the PC hardware market. This move has several concomitant side-effects:\n  \nMaking AI a mandatory feature on the PC, with all the juicy free data they will be able to harvest from it. Requiring an NPU (i.e. an AI-capable chip) as a standard on all future PCs.\n Herding all the PC Gamer market onto the XBOX (which will still be Intel/AMD based) and possibly onto other upcoming compatible consoles (there's been talk of allowing Steam and Epic marketplaces on the XBOX platform, which would be HUGE... also, a Steam console, anyone?) It's possible that the x86_64 architecture will remain in wide use as gaming hardware.\n (Possibly) Locking down the ability of booting Linux or any other OS on such ARM hardware. This should be contested with all the Anti-Trust legal recourse available everywhere. (EDIT: disproved here)\n Setting back the advance of the Linux marketshare at least for a while. \n  \nThis last point is the one I would emphasize the most: currently, Linux on ARM seems to be kind of an afterthought among developers, and most distributions have builds targeted at the Raspberry Pi and such small platforms. To my knowledge, only RHEL (and its community clones) offer an ARM build with full desktop capabilities, but these seem to be targeted at servers.\n How long until the major Linux distributions catch up with the switch to ARM, and become ready to deliver the current level of software reliability onto the new PCs?\n Easy with the downvoting, people!\n I am presenting my concerns here, I believe these issues should be discussed. No point in burying the post if you don't fully agree with what I'm saying. I would appreciate your opinion and insight, thanks.\n    submitted by    /u/Economy_Blueberry_25  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Microsoft recently announced that they will officially be monitoring every single action users make. This decision is likely to upset many people, creating an opportunity for Linux developers to capitalize on this advantage. To attract more users, developers should consider increasing advertisements, such as YouTube ads, to highlight the benefits of switching to Linux. Additionally, emphasizing improvements in game support, controller support, ease of use with Wayland, and the new Nvidia 555 driver, which adds explicit sync, could further entice users to make the switch. By focusing on these key areas, Linux could significantly increase its market share. However, advertising could be challenging given the multitude of Linux distributions available. Forming a union or coalition of Linux distributions to pool resources and create unified marketing campaigns could be a viable strategy, although it may be difficult to achieve. To fully capitalize on this moment, Linux developers and advocates should highlight compatibility and support, promote security and privacy, leverage community support, and showcase commercial options. The developers should emphasize the underlying issue with Windows, which is currently privacy and performance, areas where Linux excels. Showcasing commercial options could also be a good start, presenting well-supported commercial distros like Ubuntu, Mint, and Pop!_OS. By implementing these strategies, the Linux community can better position itself to attract users disillusioned by Microsoft's recent actions.\n    submitted by    /u/Comfortable_Two2925  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hi, I’m back again with another question regarding developing for Linux.\n Since my last post here, I have done some more “investigating” about developing applications for Linux. I have played around a bit with Gnome builder, but to be completely honest, using XML for the UI is a complete nightmare, for me as someone who is Dyslexic.. It is not that I have never used XML, i have done some developing for Android using XML, but building UI in GNOME builder is a whole new level of …..\n Blueprints seems way more manageable, a lot more similar to Jetpack Compose.\n Gnome builder doesn’t appear to support Blueprint at all, when taking another look at Workbench, it appears like it could be used as a full blown IDE and not just as a companion tool for Gnome builder.\n Gnome Builder supports C, Vala, Java, Rust.. Workbench appears to support Java, Vala and/or Rust? Workbench seems to be fully capable to convert Blueprint to XML.\n I have also gotten my hands on what I believe is the necessary files to try to develop for Linux using Android Studio with Kotlin Multi-Platform.\n I hope to do some tinkering this weekend, but I would like some advice if possible, could I try using Workbench as an IDE, should I use it as a translation tool (build the UI in workbench using Blueprint, switch it over to XML and copy that in to Gnome Builder), start exploring Kotlin Multi-platform or use some other IDE?\n    submitted by    /u/Whit-Batmobil  \n [link]   [comments]",

However I would keep experiencing constant crashes when compiling large programs or trying to run intensive games - complete lockup of my system, full reboot required. I couldn't even compile swww! I would just have to get lucky if something would actually compile. Yes, granted I should've RMA'ed my CPU but at the time there wasn't much information on the instability of these CPUs. Anyways, I eventually just accepted my fate and rolled with the punches.\n However, recently it has come to light that many people have had similar issues regarding the stability and Intel themselves addressed it - claiming that mobo manufacturers are pushing the CPU too far. (Quite frankly I don't really care who is actually at fault.) These stability issues have forced mobo manufacturers to implement a \"Intel Baseline Profile\" to fix this. \n Upon updating my bios and enabling this option I can comfortably compile anything with no issues whatsoever and as of writing still have not had any issues. So if you're like me and bashing your head into a wall consider, checking your manufacturer's website for a bios update.\n Is this the best solution? I don't know, I'm just happy my PC doesn't crash when doing literally anything CPU intensive.\n TL;DR: 13th and 14th gen K-series CPUs are unstable resulting in crashes of high loads, update bios and enable Intel Baseline Profile.\n Sources: Falcon Northwest, Intel's Statement\n    submitted by    /u/capybara_in_a_coma  \n [link]   [comments]",

Everything here with a caveat \"in the foreseeable future\".\n  \nIntel/AMD are not going to disappear, and it is uncertain to what extent ARM laptops will take over. There will be Linux certified devices for professionals regardless and, obviously, Linux compatible-hardware for, say, for server use.\n Linux has been running on ARM devices for a long time, so ARM itself is not the issue. My understanding is that that boot systems for ARM devices are less standardized and many current ARM devices need tailored solutions for this. And then there is the whole Apple M-series devices issue, with lots of non-standard hardware.\n  \nSince reddit/the internet is full of \"chicken little\" reactions to poorly understood/speculative tech news, I wanted to ask to what extent you think that the potential new wave of ARM Windows laptops is going to be:\n a) not a big deal, we will have Linux running on them easily in a newbie-friendly way very soon, or\n b) like the Apple M-series, where progress will be made, but you can hardly recommend Linux on those for newbies?\n Any thoughts?\n    submitted by    /u/nongaussian  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Something happened to me today, which has sparked a new rabbit hole for me to run down.\n I recently (last couple months) have gone from DE's to WM's. I have enjoyed it thoroughly. Hyprland has been my sole experience so far, and along with that I have been using Waybar.\n Happy accident. After a recent update (I thought), Waybar failed to load. I was playing around with the config, json modules and style files trying to find out what was causing it to not load properly for me, all the time freaking out that I could no longer see my battery indicator, Network Manager or Blueman applet's, etc...\n Then it hit me. It's not much, I'm on a laptop which is why I was so worried about not having the battery indicator, but that extra bit of screen realestate....was really nice. And had a cool aesthetic without the bar.\n I've played around in the past with auto-hiding bar's and panels. But I've started diving into ways to get around even needing a bar or panel of any kind. With the WM, I haven't been minimising apps, but using different workspaces, so it's not really needed as a place to store minimised apps anymore. At most I have 3-5 workspaces going at a time, so I don't REALLY need a workspace indicator either. I've added a Clock to my browser, which I almost always have one open, and should we really be clock watching anyway?\n So, this has me looking at this \"happy accident\" of Waybar not loading, that is forcing me to re-evaluate and look at a different way of doing things.\n What kind of \"Happy Accidents\" have you had in your Linux or Tech journey's in general?\n (I fixed Waybar, dummy me did a fresh install and forgot to install pavucontrol and so I'm guessing a crashing module was causing it to not load. Installed pavucontrol and now it works fine, but I'm still intrigued by this new path I'm going down.)\n    submitted by    /u/JSinisin  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "It's not clear to me how Chrome encrypt user data in general, as it had migrated away from GNOME Keyring or KDE Wallet (native backend) to loginDB, which could be both unencrypted and encrypted, as shown in Chromium issue #40449930, #40621995, #41451554, and password_store_x.h in the source.\n Also, if anyone on GNOME open Seahorse (the Passwords and Keys app), there will be a dummy entry of Chrome Safe Storage Control with The meaning of life as the password. The reason for this is as explained in Chromium issue #40490926 regarding Libsecret API in comment #8.\n Does this mean that the purpose of system keyring on Linux is only to be used as a dummy entry for Chrome?\n What if Chrome can't access the system keyring, is the user data still being encrypted? For example, in a container environment that can't access the system keyring in any circumstance even with --cap-add=IPC_LOCK and --privileged, see GNOME Keyring issue #77.\n I tested in a rootless Podman container (created by Distrobox), Google's password manager in Chrome is working fine. I can even turn on the on-device encryption feature.\n The password manager also works well in both Edge and Vivaldi in the container environment where the system keyring is not available. It's worth mentioning that as of 01/12/2024, Edge's docs regarding the password manager in the browser is still referring to the system keyring as its encryption method on Linux.\n The only browser that's still using the system keyring to encrypt user data is Brave, as it really has a randomized password in its entry in GNOME Seahorse instead of The meaning of life like Chrome. And it won't allow the user to sync in a container where the system keyring is not available, in which it warns the user about the permission issue in its password manager's GUI.\n I'm worried that other Chromium browsers might silently store unencrypted user data without any warning like Brave. In that case, it would make using those browsers in Distrobox very dangerous.\n    submitted by    /u/3cue  \n [link]   [comments]",

Am I missing something?\n But then the article appears on opensource.com which is supported by Red Hat, no less.\n So for a moment I am a bit bewildered and thinking: Am I missing something? Is there some definition of terminal multiplexers I am not aware of?\n And I look through the comments and no-one calls out the author saying that the last two are not terminal multiplexers.\n So what is going on?\n EDIT: A lot of people seem to equate the ability to open panes or tabs in a terminal emulator with multiplexing. The OP on this SU question summarizes it nicely:\n  \nFrom what I understand now, tmux/screen and other multiplexers are virtual sessions, i.e. multiple virtual sessions within the original session. This is in contrast to opening new tabs in terminal which are actually creating new sessions.\n  \n   submitted by    /u/mydoghasticks  \n [link]   [comments]",

What about the second part (localhost:22)? What is that one doing? \n Thanks! \n    submitted by    /u/anth3nna  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "DigiPaws is an open-source Android productivity utility designed to help users reduce screen addiction by regulating app usage through a gamified experience. The application offers three distinct modes—Easy, Adventure, and Hard—each with unique features and challenges to promote healthy screen time habits.\n 🌱 Easy mode: When you attempt to access a blocked app, a warning screen appears. If you choose to proceed, a cooldown period starts. After the cooldown, another warning is displayed to remind you of your usage.\n ✨ Adventure Mode: introduces a gamified experience to control screen time. To access a blocked app, you need DigiCoins. These can be earned by completing quests such as a quick 1 km walk. Each DigiCoin grants 20 minutes of usage time for any blocked app, encouraging physical activity and mindful screen use. - Quests 1. Touch Grass - Displace yourself by 1km 2. Api (todo) - other devs can tranform their existing app as an digipaw quest! 3. more quests- comming soon. Drop ideas below\n 🤯 Hard mode: Hard Mode offers the most stringent control over app usage. In this mode, when you try to open a blocked app, the back button is automatically pressed without any warning or cooldown, preventing access entirely.\n Available blockers; Short form content blocker Comments and video description blocker App blocker Explicit content blocker \n Give me a ✨ at https://github.com/nethical6/digi-paws\n Wanna try it? https://github.com/nethical6/digi-paws/tags\n    submitted by    /u/Nethical69  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Day one Pixel 8 Pro owner here. Thought I’d share my experience, after almost 8 months of ownership.\n P8P Bay 256GB has been my daily driver since its release. I use it with 5G on, screen at full resolution, dynamic \"smooth display\" refresh rate is on, no bluetooth or tethering. Brightness left on auto.\n TLDR : Positives = Camera quality, great design & display, OS (with some caveats) | Negatives = everything else\n The positives :\n Camera : beautiful imagery has always been the signature of the Pixel line, and this release is no exception. Every shot has this mesmerizing \"Pixel touch\", and the new ultrawide sensor is finally on par with the main unit. Videos are world class too, not quite on the level of the iPhone but we'll get there eventually.\n Beautiful and unique design : It's sitting…",

          "description": "I recently switched from an android (One Plus) to ios (iphone 15). While I was aware of several physical limitations like slow charging, 60Hz refresh rate and notch(dynamic island), I always believed that iphone's true magic was its usability. However, using it for few days has made me realize how underwhelming iOS is in terms of basic functionalities. This was definitely not what I expected from an enterprise that prides itself on being design centric. That's why I am writing this use case based assessment of iOS and iphone comparing it with similar functionalities in Android so that anyone thinking about making the switch can make an informed decision.\n Usecase 1) - Segregating Volume levels of app notifications and call ringtone - I get maybe more than 50 notifications a day.

          "description": "背景：\n楼主是广东某双非本科大三学生，现在的专业是电子商务，自知前途一般，所以也在找别的出路。从大一开始有同学带着做机器学习相关的竞赛，从那时候开始入门，然后开始接触数据分析、数据挖掘这方面的之后，发现对这些比较感兴趣后，就开始自己多去接触学习了这方面的知识，西瓜书、花书也买来看过，基本的机器学习算法模型是了解的，XGBoost 、LGBM 、yolo 之类的模型、算法，虽说原理没有仔细钻研过，不过该调包该调参还是会的，会主动学习新领域的知识，所以在这三年也打过几个比赛，至于结果的话，只有一两个成绩能拿的出手😭。\n考研\n从上面背景也可以看出，楼主也是想吃数据分析、数据科学这方面的饭的，了解过数分岗位的话对于学历要求可能没有数据挖掘、算法开发岗这么高，当然薪酬对应也相对低一点。\n考虑到岗位的要求、本身专业的限制以及楼主可能更想赚点小钱钱，所以也是从去年开始就准备考暨南大学应用统计的研究生（当然我也了解到，如果要搞算法岗的话，大概率非 92 不要，而且计算机硕可能更合适，不过这已经是楼主尽力摸高能到的相关专业）。\n但是说实话，目前也不太了解暨大的应统出来到底能不能跟我预期考研的目标匹配，如果有暨大应统的学长学姐解惑就最好了，感激不尽。\n考研的担忧\n楼主之所以考研有点忧虑，一是因为听到许多研究生毕业出来也难找工作，二是牛某网的等的论坛帖子中，对于本科拿到好工作 offer 后的建议也都是”推荐工作，没准考研后连现在待遇的 offer 都拿不到“的言论影响了判断，感觉考研上岸也不是一定会是正收益了。\n实习\n上网经常看见这种”想要考研上岸就不要想别的，整天担心忧虑自己考不上就一定考不上“这样的话，楼主对这些言论通常有点嗤之以鼻的态度，当然也可能因为没考过研，年轻气盛才不喜欢这种言论。但看现在的形势，考研越来越难，而且像是应用统计这个专业，叠加上这几年机器学习和 AI 的潮流，应统更是卷上加卷，而且我们学校电子商务专业的考研上岸率也低，大概只有 7%左右的样子，还都是本校考管科的研究生。这些情况也不得不让我担忧，为自己上不了岸准备后路，不至于一年过后的今天什么都没有。\n目前楼主没有实习经历，也就是这个原因，所以楼主担心在今年的秋招中可能会吃亏，到时秋招找不到工作保底，上岸上不了，直接双输。但是按楼主撰写这篇文章的时间（ 2024.6.6 ）的话，暑期实习可能也有点难找了，想要进好一点的公司也要靠熟人推荐碰碰运气，并且要花点时间来准备面试，这方面留给楼主抉择的时间也不多了，所以有点烦恼。\n楼主现在的抉择\n综合上面的考虑，目前楼主有两个不成熟的想法：\n偏向考研上岸的策略：不准备暑期实习+秋招准备一下简历面试看能不能找到一个保底工作+考暨大经济学院下的应用统计\n偏向拿到工作的策略：想办法找暑期实习看能不能凑出一段实习经历+带着实习经历去秋招+考暨南大学信息科学技术学院下的应用统计\n\"why\"：为什么一个考经济学院下的应统，一个考信息科学技术学院的应统\n是因为两个学院下应统的考研难度不同：信息院难度>经济学研的难度。\n根据楼主想要去的岗位要求，不仅要求学历而且最好有相关的科研产出的话，信息院无疑是要比经济学院要好的，而且也不愿意到时读了两年偏经济的应统硕，没什么相关的论文，最后与岗位的其他人没有竞争优势，浪费两年时间就更亏了。\n所以如何按策略 2 能够稳工作的话，就冲一冲更好的，如何工作不稳的话，就按策略 1 来，起码考研能稳一点，不知道我的想法对不对。\n楼主信息还是闭塞，希望 v 友们对我的规划提提意见，如果有相关数分、数据类岗位的要求、真实的需求现状之类的信息能分享就感激不尽了，如果有暨大应统的学长学姐可以交流就更感动了，第一次发帖希望说的清楚一点，所以废话有点多，v 友多包含。",

          "description": "5 月 7 日发布新款 iPad Air 时，苹果官网内对其的描述为“10 核图形处理器”，但在 5 月 30 日至 31 日期间，苹果把“10 核”改成了“9 核”。目前苹果 Newsroom 的新闻稿和线下直营店都还未修改“10 核图形处理器”的描述，而其他页面则已经全部改成了“9 核”。此外小红书上很多人表示，他们向苹果官方客服反应这个问题，苹果客服也承认官网修改了对于 GPU 核心数的描述。\n我是购买了首发的 13 英寸 M2 iPad Air ，用 Geekbench6 跑了一下 GPU 测试，13 英寸的 M2 iPad Air 跑分成绩比数据库内 11 英寸 iPad Pro 的满血 M2 低了 7%，比我的 8 核 M2 MacBook Air 高 5%，比较符合 9 核 GPU 的成绩。由于目前 iPad 端貌似没有 app 可以直接读取 GPU 核心数，所以只能拿跑分成绩作为一个参考。\n17 年惠普也有过类似的虚假宣传问题，惠普将三热管、四热管的散热描述为五热管，最终惠普对消费者进行了退一赔三。苹果在 2022 年也有遇到类似问题，将 M1 形容为苹果的最快芯片（估计是直接复制早期文案了），最终只是被罚了 20 万元。\n目前我已经在 12315 投诉苹果，看看最后苹果怎么处理吧",

          "description": "最近几天在研究安装黑苹果，要安装 macOS  Catalina 系统。\n这就涉及到了搭建 opencore 会恢复 U 盘，但是到了 gibMacOS 软件的 MakeInstall 制作恢复 U 盘的时候，出现错误。在 github 咨询软件开发者，他回复道：\nIn order to properly format the device ahead of time, you'll need 2 partitions. The first should be a 200 (or so) MB FAT32 partition, this is where the EFI will reside. The second needs to be a RAW partition of a size large enough to hold the HFS+ image for the recovery environment (usually 1GB or more). It is important that it is a RAW partition, as MakeInstall uses dd to write the contents of the BaseSystem.dmg to the partition - and Windows cannot natively read/write HFS+ - so it needs a blank canvas per se for that data.\n-CorpNewt\n我问题来了，第一个 200MB 分区很容易创建，但是使用 diskgenius 却找不到如何创建“RAW 分区”选项，大家是如何创建这种分区呢？",

          "description": "过敏性支气管哮喘，简称“哮喘”，是发病率最高的慢性呼吸道疾病之一，影响着全球超过 3 亿人，每年约 25 万人死于哮喘。在哮喘发作期，患者常会咳嗽，严重时也可能发生喘息和呼吸困难，需要使用能快速扩张气道药物。\n引起哮喘发作的因素有很多。作为一种过敏性疾病，哮喘发作可以被很多吸入性过敏原触发，例如花粉、尘螨、蟑螂分泌物等。此外，感冒病毒等呼吸道感染，烟草烟雾、香水、空气污染等刺激物可能引起哮喘发作。甚至，哭泣或大笑也可能导致有些人哮喘发作。\n对于重度哮喘患者来说，发作的频率远高于轻度哮喘患者。频繁哮喘发作导致生活质量不断下降。为了减轻这部分患者的巨大负担，医药开发人员正在致力于开发长效疗法，让患者只需一次用药就能长期缓解病情。\n近日，清华大学彭敏研究员带领的团队设计了一种利用 CAR-T 细胞治疗哮喘的潜在新疗法。根据他们刚刚发表在《自然-免疫学》上的动物实验结果，过敏性哮喘小鼠接受一次注射后，哮喘的迹象和症状可以得到长期抑制。\n说到 CAR-T 细胞，大家对于这种疗法在癌症领域的应用或许已经不陌生。T 细胞经过基因工程改造后，装上了嵌合抗原受体（即 CAR ）后，就有了定位到肿瘤附近的导航，可以有效识别癌细胞并将其清除。这种免疫疗法已经在治疗血液肿瘤方面取得了显著的成功。\n而在新研究中，CAR-T 细胞装上的导航会把它们带到嗜酸性粒细胞细胞附近将其清除。嗜酸性粒细胞是非常重要的炎症效应细胞，在哮喘患者的气道高反应性及气道重塑的病理改变中起到重要作用。研究显示，具有嗜酸性粒细胞表型的重度哮喘患者，发生严重急性发作的风险超过了普通重度哮喘患者。\n经过研究人员的设计，这些 CAR-T 细胞靶向嗜酸性粒细胞表面的 IL-5 受体，以便免疫系统清除嗜酸性粒细胞。不仅如此，这些 CAR-T 细胞还会分泌一种 IL-4 突变蛋白，让突变蛋白阻断 IL-4 和 IL-3 的信号转导，从而避免这两种细胞因子在患者气道引起炎症和气道重塑。\n研究人员在过敏性哮喘小鼠模型中测试了这种 CAR-T 疗法，发现只需单次注射，就能持续抑制肺部炎症并缓解哮喘症状。此外，这些 CAR-T 细胞被发现能维持至少一年，在此期间持续防止过敏性免疫反应。\n论文总结说，这些临床前数据表明，一剂长效 CAR-T 有望实现哮喘的长期缓解。不过，这种潜在的新疗法还需要通过进一步的临床试验，测试是否对过敏性哮喘人类患者安全有效。",

          "description": "前前后后折腾了几次，买过一些路由器大部分又出手了，目前留了几个路由器等以后空了再折腾玩玩，还有一些“小主机”作为软路由，R2S 、J425 等等，折腾过梅林固件、原生 openwrt 等等，上一个方案是光猫 -> J425 （ openwrt -> iStoreOS ） -> AP mesh 。目前折腾了一个适合自己家路的网络拓扑方案：\n光猫 → 网件路由器 → Mac mini\n      \n正常终端设备直连路由器使用，Mac mini 安装 Surge 作为第二个网关，不开启 DHCP （ DHCP 仍然由路由器提供，这样不影响主网络），配置好科学，需要用到的设备将网关地址和 DNS 指向这台 Mac ，由 Surge 接管并按策略和规则处理流量分发。\n家里各种需要科学的设备由 Surge 接管：\nApple TV：本身服务走香港节点，其中 YouTube 、Disney+、Netflix ，HBO MAX 分别走香港、新加坡、美国等节点\nXbox Series X：香港或美国节点\nSwitch：香港节点\niPhone 、iPad：默认香港节点\n其他服务：\nChatGPT 4o：美国节点\n其他：去广告、过滤、根据设备或者客户端或者应用做分流配置\n实际体验下来还是不错的，日常使用非常无感+稳定，基本上花一些时间配置完就不用再动了\n另外 Surge 也提供了 Surge Ponte 作为私有 mesh 网络，除了通过 iPhone 在外可以简单控制 Mac mini 的 Surge 配置、请求查看以外，还可以在没有公网 IP 的情况下通过 Ponte 代理访问内网数据，比如访问家里的文件、NAS （只要你流量足够，服务器带宽足够，线路好，不然还是建议走公网直连）\n后续的拓扑方案也考虑过：\n光猫改桥接（如果你是上海电信的宽带建议把云网关也关了，另外改桥接会影响 IPTV ，如果你有 IPTV 家里人要看，在折腾前要把光猫的所有配置做好记录和备份），购买 RouterOS 设备作为主路由拨号且接管 DHCP （ ROS 可以通过 DHCP Options 快速分配网关和 DNS ），路由器仅作为 AP Mesh （有线回程），家庭网线升级超六类，内网理论上支持万兆网速，家庭服务器上（例如 Mac mini ）安装 ss 作为代理服务器，ROS 仅开放一个端口用来回家，如果家里有摄像头的则可以禁用外网，配合 NAS 把数据全部离线存储在本地（对于家里有老人、宠物的比较实用），其他的就不赘述了，配置好后基本上可以不用再折腾了。。\n另外我也看过其他代理软件，但是最终选择了 Surge ，纯属个人偏爱。\n从小白（没学过网络工程和计算机）一点点折腾到现在，感觉目前这套方案最适合家里用（ Mac mini 作为旁路由的情况下，被我折腾好多次开关机，但是仍不影响主网络的使用，家里人完全无感），未来的升级方案也大致有了方向。\n不知道大家有没有好的建议和经历可以一起讨论～～",

          "description": "问题是什么？\n作为前 GitLab 架构师，我深知一个困扰大家很久的问题：就是代码没有有效、可读、可快速获取的注释。代码没注释，读得就慢。读得越慢，写得越慢。具体有这些表现：\n程序员需要阅读优秀的开源项目代码，但996 的工作时间让这变得困难。\n自己写的代码没有注释，几年后再看不懂，增加新功能时需重新理解。\n阅读他人的旧代码尤其是混乱的代码库，耗时且令人沮丧，但项目需求不得不读。\n给别人解释代码比较耗时。有时希望有一个工具来自动完成这个任务，帮助同事或者网友理解代码。\nCyberGit 的诞生\n作为这个领域从业者，我很早就开始使用 copilot 和类似的工具。不过 copilot 和国内数十家竞品工具都没有很人性化的解决读代码的问题。\n所以就自己做吧!\n就这样，CyberGit 诞生了。\nCyberGit 首先会对于项目进行工程化的分析，再使用 AI 和 Agents 进行代码解释，提高了注释准确率。还有以下特点：\n交互设计优化，切换文件的时候自动获取到按类、方法、函数划分的代码注释。\n注释内容做到更准确的压缩，一目十行读代码。\n并且 hover 到对应元素上才显示，不侵犯程序员的代码空间，不影响 commits，给程序员同学们丝滑的代码阅读体验。\n如何使用\n有兴趣的同学们可以在 https://cybergit.cn 注册使用。现在注册有 500 万 token 赠送。\n使用指导见以下文档： https://jxqetf736zs.feishu.cn/wiki/SZgPwq234ij3DAk0GAEcHfY0nNe\nCAVEATS\n由于时间原因，目前暂时只上线了 Java 和 Python 的分析，其他语言也在紧锣密鼓开发中。敬请期待。\n同样由于时间原因，目前只上线了 vscode ，如果大家喜欢，后续可以考虑 Idea 系列的编辑器。",

          "description": "背景：\n最近准备 618 换个冰箱：14 年前买的老冰箱，存储不够，经常出水，急冻结满了厚厚的冰，新房子预留的空间够大：宽 97cmX 深 74cmX228cm ，家里两个人。\n预算：不超过 15000 。\n款式：确定法式开门，内嵌不内嵌无所谓，容量 450-500L 就行了。\n品牌与爱好：不迷信任何品牌，只看中性价比，非常担心被收智商税。\n查询了很多资料，突然发现，买冰箱跟买车一样难了，这个行业鱼龙混杂的，越来越迷茫了！\n目前的主要困惑：\n1 ，冰箱最基本的低温储藏，似乎各家都有什么看家本领核心技术，比如西门子的零度 plus 保鲜，美的微晶保鲜，松下-3°，海尔全空间保鲜等等，似乎没有搭载各家品牌的拿手保鲜技术就不算买这个牌子了。\n但是另一个极端，这些都是些唬人的智商税，最基本的就是食材放保鲜膜、塑料袋就行了，而且应该尽量吃新鲜，避免放久了再吃的不健康生活习惯。\n\n2 ，高端的差异化\n制冰功能似乎很多人喜欢，随时有冰块，做冷饮冰沙等，有些牌子比如卡萨帝接近万元的都没这功能。\n另一个极端说是比如制冰机，冰箱不专业，加了这个功能要贵几千块。\n主动与被动杀菌：一个极端说是要选择主动杀菌的，健康着想，另一个极端说这又是智商税，没啥用。食材放塑料袋，保鲜膜保鲜盒，根本没这样的事儿，定期清洗一下冰箱比什么杀菌都强。\n\n3 ，我自己的选择：\n高端冰箱看好了一款：东芝大白桃 479 ，价格在 12000 左右，基本上要的什么功能都有了。\nhttps://item.jd.com/10043788830914.html \n中低端挑了一款，美的 508 ，参考价格 3600\nhttps://item.jd.com/100007351130.html \n平替青春版姊妹款华凌 526 ，参考价格 2600 。（华凌被美的收购，定位比美的低端一点）\nhttps://item.jd.com/10091332297851.html \n\n我现在就有点纠结，要么就一步到位选东芝这款 479 得了，高大上。要么就 low 到底，选华凌 526 ，价格便宜。\n从来没买东西这样，极端选品，所以现在比较纠结，选东芝担心一万多买个智商税，选华凌又担心低端，享受不到那些所谓的高端功能，以及制冰自由？\n所以，各位彦祖，有啥看法？",

          "description": "Devlog #001: 序言\n一个游戏开发爱好者的追梦之旅~\n持续更新: https://techartlife.com/gamedev/devlog/day-001\n作为一个游戏开发爱好者，我一直有个梦想：开发一个完整的游戏项目并上线。\n最近刚好有个契机，所以我决定正式开始制作游戏，也就是这个从零开始制作游戏项目。\n作为一个 从零开始 的项目，可想而知，其开发周期会非常长、涉及的领域也会非常多。所以，我打算把开发过程记录下来，整理成一个开发日志专题。我将在这里记录如何从零开始制作一个 3D 游戏，初步预期游戏类型是生存类模拟经营游戏，可能类似饥荒。\n作为一个从零开始的项目，我们会逐渐从 2D 项目一步步推进，逐渐过渡到 3D 项目的开发中。另外，作为一个 Hobby Project ，本项目的开发过程也可能与实际的游戏项目开发流程存在较大差异，望知悉。\n🌟欢迎催更🌟 \n本项目是我的爱好项目(Hobby Project)，内容选题方向和进度推进主要由个人兴趣驱动。\n当然，如果你对本项目非常感兴趣，也可以通过订阅 Patreon 支持来催更😛。\n主要内容\n我将在这里展示游戏在不同阶段的开发结果，预计包含的主题有：\n游戏引擎开发: Game Engine Development\n计算机图形学: Computer Graphics\n多人联机: Multiplayer Online\nPyGame 框架\n游戏引擎选择\n目前比较流行的游戏引擎有 Unity3D/Unreal/Godot/Cocos 等，这些游戏引擎一般功能模块都比较全，但是各个模块的封装度比较高、体量比较大，即使有源码也不方便修改。\n既然要从零开始制作游戏，干脆直接一点顺便从引擎开始做。为了避免在一些繁琐的操作系统差异(Windows/MacOS)和各种渲染 API 差异（ OpenGL/Vulkan/Direct3D/Metal ）上浪费不必要的时间，我选择在 PyGame 框架的基础上搭建整个项目。如果中途遇到有其他合适的通用系统模块（例如物理引擎模块），到时候也将考虑直接使用。\n🌟从引擎开始制作游戏🌟 \n不同于 Unity/Unreal/Godot\n引擎的主要定位是为具体的游戏玩法提供底层支持。\n:::\n游戏类型\n常见的热门游戏类型主要有：\n🌟模拟经营\n🌟生存建造\nFPS/TPS\nMoba\n经典游戏\n这个项目预计会先从 2D 游戏开始，逐渐过渡到 3D 游戏。\n脚本语言\nLua\n🌟 Python\nJavaScript\nC#\n为什么选择 Python ?\n通用型脚本语言，生态丰富。\nSimple and Efficient.\n系统支持\n为了简化发布和测试流程，在核心玩法稳定之前，我们的主要目标是保证 PC 平台可玩。\nWindows 10/11\nMacOS\n参考资料\nhttps://www.python.org/\nhttps://www.pygame.org/\n备注\n持续更新链接: https://techartlife.com/gamedev/devlog/day-001\n欢迎大家关注&交流~",

          "description": "就是常见的飞书文档钉钉文档那套东西，不过不用 OT ，用 CRDT 来实现协同，最近调研的社区最火的 yjs 。\n但发现用 yjs 做版本恢复的话，要把所有的 update 都存下来，yjs 的 snapshot 存的只是 ydoc 某个时间点的版本坐标，没有数据，要想用 snapshot 还原版本，还得把之前所有的 update 存下来，初始化的时候全部取出来一个个 applyUpdate ，把本地的 ydoc 还原到之前最新的状态，之后才能用 snapshot 回溯到某个版本。\n后端 websocket 网络层用了社区的 hocuspocus ，问题是每个字符的改变 onchange 方法里都会生成一个 update ，如果文档有几万字，就至少有几万个 update(还有段落啥的特殊字符)，这样前端还原 ydoc 的时候这里接口都要返回几万条 update 数据前端一个个 applyUpdate 也太不合理了。像 OT 恢复版本取得是最近的一个快照和后面的 update 数据，问题 yjs 的快照只存的是坐标，想请教一下这块优化怎么处理的好？是不是 yjs 也定期 flush 一下把之前 update 手动合并一下？但 yjs 并没有相关的 api ，只能从结构上表面上合并成数组，返回给前端的数据条数上减少一点。\n或者想听听各位对 yjs 做协同这块版本历史怎么实践的，网上这块资料基本为 0 。",

          "description": "我知道 Python 本身是强类型的，而且非常强。标题里的强类型是指能够“锁住”动态类型的情况。\n通常我们用 Python 开发工具时都是很享受动态类型的便利性和开发速度的，随着 3.6 开始添加 typehints ，慢慢地，类型系统也在向类 typescript 迁移。我个人是完全不喜欢把 python 写成 java 的写法的，无限的类型约束加上死板的写法，以及强行实现的毫无必要的设计模式，我感觉这是纯脑瘫行为。但是我欣然接受在关键节点、关键组件和关键模块引入严格的类型检查，以我的经验来看可以有效减少开发过程中 bug 产生。\n举例来说就是，python 的灵活性让我们可以向任意变量传入任意类型，如果想传入固定数据结构，可以通过注释约束，但没有解释器保障。往往我们推崇防御性编程，实际参与多人项目提交代码时，如果传入复杂结构就需要进行多重校验，以确保程序执行正常。\npersons = [\n\t{\n    \t\"姓名\": \"张三\",\n        \"年龄\": 19\n    }\n]\n\n例如如果想编写一个函数接受上述输入，防御性的写法可能是\ndef func(persons: list[...]):\n    if not persons:\n        return ... # err1\n    person_one = persons.pop(0)\n    age = person_one.get(\"年龄\")\n    if age is None:\n        return ... # err2\n    # else\n    ... # 业务逻辑\n\n加入以上大段代码，可以在发生手抖输入错误，数据清洗不到位，或者程序未知细节处产生未知行为时让函数仍然符合设计工作。缺点可能是行数太多，说实话也完全丧失了灵活性优势。\n我寻思既然已经 2024 年了，typehints 用来描述类型倒是没啥问题。问题是现在社区出没出什么方案，可以在编译器或者运行时阶段检查输入和输出两个节点，把函数掐头去尾一下，我感觉 bug 都会少很多。\nfrom typing import List, TypedDict\n\nclass Person(TypedDict)\n    name: str\n    age: int\n\ndef func(persons: List[Person]):\n    age = persons.pop(0).get(\"age\") + 1\n    return ...\n\n不知道有没有什么东西能实现上述效果，可以结合 typing 确保输入类型准确，避开检查代码的。目前。目前来说上面这套写法只有解释器检查，在动态的过程中没办法做任何检查，也就是说如果三方库，或者自己写的代码有 bug ，导致了任何的意料外行为时没有办法起到任何的防御性作用，debug 又是地狱了。",

          "description": "2024 ，0513-0519 ，第 20 周\n这周五，一个四年前定下的提醒事项弹了出来，是极简时钟最早的一个域名到期了。\n这个域名绑定的就是极简时钟的静态 landing page ，自打上线后我好像就没动过，导致我都忘了这个页面是 host 在哪里，通过反查 DNS 才知道是一个 GitHub page……\n2020 年正是极简时钟的快速上升期，那时候也有样学样地买了个域名，在网上找了个模板就把这个 landing page 完成了。至于这四年有多少访问量，就无从得知了。\n\n本周开发\n极简日记 iOS\n更新了 v1.7.22 ，修复了导出图片中背景色的问题。要不是用户反馈我都没发现，在给日记中加入 material 背景后，导致导出的图片中半透明的效果全都变成了十分丑陋的灰色。\nGoogle Play 的支付问题\n发现 RevenueCat 的 dashboard 中有很多 0 元续费的订阅，每天都有好几笔，一开始我还以为 app 里有 bug 导致用户可以零元购了呢，这下损失了好多啊。\n\n但是点进去一看，才知道原来是用户遇到了支付错误。在 RevenueCat 里筛选了一下，遇到支付问题的用户还不少，尤其是土耳其和东南亚居多。也不知道这个问题出在谁，是 Google Play 还是 RevenueCat ？\n\n\n又把服务器搞坏了\n一直想把国内安卓版的旧版支付 API 转发到新 API 上，这周终于有所行动了。\n先是在服务器代码上针对旧版 API 的参数做了兼容处理，然后在 nginx 添加了一条测试用的转发路径，最后部署新代码到服务器。\n本以为一都会很顺利，没想到还是出了问题，我发现正式环境里有两条付款记录没有生成对应的会员记录。经过一番排查，才发现是我画蛇添足，新建会员记录的 SQL 里添加了一个不存在的 field ，导致插入数据失败。这个插入操作是只有在收到微信支付的回调后才会执行的，而偏偏这一点我没测试到。保险起见，我就回滚代码了，那两个会员记录我也只好手动录入了。\n还好，只有两个。\n然而，第二天上午，我发现了数据库里又多了两笔 1 分钱的支付记录。我一开始还以为是安卓小哥在做测试，但是他说并没有……最终发现原来是我回滚代码的时候把价格的配置文件也给回滚了，所有的价格都恢复成了测试的价格，都是 1 分钱……偏巧有两个用户以 1 分钱解锁了原价 24 元的终身会员。\n还好，只有两个。\n本周减肥\n这周两次健身+游泳。周二游泳 1000 米游进了 40 分钟，周四的 1000 米又快了 2 分钟，38 分钟。单次连续游的距离也越来越长，最长可以连续游 300 米了。\n最近明显感觉所有裤子都肥了，都挂不住腰了。在南京旅游的时候还发现，上衣的尺码比之前小了一号。我还以为身体维度真的减小了，但是周日晚上用尺子一测，和之前的数据没有任何区别啊。\n体脂秤上的数据和 325 天之前对比，竟然一斤都没减掉，这令我很震惊。不过由于最近的运动，确实减掉了 9 斤脂肪，又增长了 9 斤肌肉，体脂率下降很多。\n\n本周开心\n这周读完了《认知觉醒》，收获颇多。说实话，这本书提到的诸多概念和行动指南，在其他书里也都有涉及，这本书本身也多次提到其他相关的书籍，比如《微习惯》《思考快与慢》《刻意练习》《心流》《暗时间》等等。但是，同样的道理，用这本书的作者周岭的话讲出来，不知道为什么，就令我感觉更好理解和接受，也解答了很多我关于拖延、焦虑、和自我提升上的困惑。\n\n还有一个，剑星，周四完成了一周目，周日完成了二周目和白金，一共花了 54 个小时。这是我买过最贵的一个游戏了，之前玩过 demo 版之后就果断下单了数位豪华版，也是我第一个玩了二周目的动作剧情类游戏。\n伊芙？衣服！在我看来，黑珍珠真的没意思，枉费大量时间和精力去舔图，还不如星球空降服原型。",

          "description": "2018 年我购买了人生中的第一台苹果设备 —— MacBook Pro 2018 ，作为陪伴我三年的 Dell Inspiron 7558 2-in-1 的继任者（时至今日，它依然是我最喜欢的笔记本电脑）。\n这台苹果笔记本在蒂姆·库克作为 Apple CEO 的时期内，“革命性”地采用了 OLED 显示屏、Touch Bar 和蝶式键盘，并在发布会上被大肆宣传。实际使用下来体验非常糟糕，Touch Bar 上的触摸功能键经常让我在调试程序时按错键，蝶式键盘特别容易出现按键粘连，作为不使用外置键盘的程序员来说，这简直就是灾难。而且不到两个月，OLED 屏幕四周就开始泛黄，烧屏。 这样的一台「库克制造」电脑在当时花费我两万块钱。而苹果糟糕的售后预约制度和（当时）动辄一周的维修时间让我放弃了维修的打算。\n后来 MacBook 终于移除备受争议的蝶式键盘。Touch Bar 是在 2021 年取消的，同时，库克居然把 iPhone 的刘海屏移植到 MacBook 上。也就是说，从 2015 至今，MacBook 用户至少要经历蝶式键盘、Touch Bar 或刘海屏，而我一次体验其中两种。\n作为苹果用户，我很难想象在库克的时期里，这十年来是如何做到每一代 MacBook 至少包含一种缺陷。制造一台基本完美的电子设备对一家市值常年世界第一的企业来说是否非常有挑战性？如果把库克当成一名商人，商人的目的就是贩卖商品，那库克一定非常出色的商人。库克时期以来制造的这些不完美的电子设备，甚至动用降频手段来刺激更新换代，把苹果的市值从几千万推到了最高三万亿。作为苹果用户，我一点也不喜欢库克。但从投资的角度来说，我又会用一套完全相反的说辞来说服自己购买苹果股票。2020 年我通过基金也间接重仓了苹果，见证苹果短短半年从 1 万亿涨到 2 万亿。\n苹果的库克时代在 2024 好像悄然翻篇，造车计划终止、错失 AI 时代、营收下滑、Vision Pro 销量不佳… 即使站在投资的角度我也很难再找到说服自己看多苹果的理由。\n库克时期内的苹果，充斥着商品的气味，缺乏划时代的创新。\n（文章写于 2024 年，使用 MacBook Pro 2018 ）\n转载于 https://vm0x00.com/posts/tim-cook @vm0x01",

          "description": "做为一名新手创业者，深刻清楚高质量信息流的重要性。\n职场、亲友这种强关系可以带来基于信任+共同认知的深度交流，更多新的机会来自于在弱关系交流中的挖掘，以及对于社会资源的整合。\n如果你的圈子都是一直打工的上班族，那大概率很难互相激发新的视角去思考问题。\n所以通过拓展圈子，去重置语境非常重要。\n我自己运营着超过千人的离职校友微信社群，以及十个以上的陌生人社群，也基于好奇心，添加了很多不同发起主题的社群。根据观察，大多数微信群是比较松散的组织型态、仅仅做为信息即时交流场所存在（这也跟微信原本的产品形态有关），人数超过三位数的社群，潜水的情况就会比较明显，同时很难（有意愿）开展深入沟通。\n兴趣社群+有过共同经历、线下见过面的社群（比如在一起学过什么课程）相对交流氛围会好些，归属感强一些吧。\n归根到底，主要有以下几个原因导致：\n1.不知道如何提问。有时候一个大的问题很难在社群这种交流形态里得到有效解答（论坛是更合适的公开讨论场域），拆成具体问题又不知道路径。\n2.提问后回复有时差，再加上不同话题间没法区隔，也就失去了讨论的氛围。\n3.收到回复的信息视角丰富度不够。现在每个人的群都很多+有高质量信息的人往往没太有时间回复，比如创业者群，我自己也是想提问的时候才会去群里看看。\n以上，有两个问题想要探讨：\n1.微信社群是否只能当作一个通知工具来用———对照大多数人不活跃的状态，有没有优化的可能性。\n比如通过 a.机制（设置入群门槛、指定值班的人）、b.运营（定期发起活动）等重度运营方式。\n有没有类似的案例参考？做过私域的人可能都比较关心这个问题。\n2.衍生思考：个体在当前变化加速的时代背景下，就算不创业，也是需要职场关系外的长期归属感的，如何打造这样的组织呢？",

          "description": "大家好，我是 V2EX 的新成员，一名对编程充满热情的新手开发者。经过数月的努力和自学，我非常激动地宣布，我开发了自己的第一款 Web 应用 - ImageEditor.online 。这是一个在线图像编辑器，提供了包括 Image Restore 、Generative Fill 、Object Remove 、Object Recolor 以及 Background Remove 等功能。\n在开始这个项目之前，我只是一个编程爱好者，通过在线的开源课程和教程，我逐步学习了 Web 开发的基础知识。在这个过程中，我萌生了一个想法，那就是打造一个既实用又易于使用的在线图像编辑器。\n开发过程：\n技能学习： 我首先专注于学习 HTML 、CSS 和 JavaScript ，然后逐步掌握了 React 框架，以便构建前端界面。\n功能实现： 为了让 ImageEditor.online 具备先进的图像处理功能，我集成了多个 AI 图像处理 API ，实现了包括图像修复、生成式填充、对象移除和背景去除等功能。\n用户体验： 在开发过程中，我不断测试和优化用户界面，以确保用户能够轻松上手并享受编辑图像的乐趣。\n上线与推广： 最终，我将 ImageEditor.online 部署到了线上，并通过社交媒体和开发社区进行了推广。\n成果与展望：\n到目前为止，ImageEditor.online 已经收到了来自用户的积极反馈，他们对应用的易用性和功能表示满意。我也从中学到了很多，并且计划继续添加新的功能和改进用户体验。\n我非常期待听到 V2EX 社区成员的宝贵意见和反馈，以帮助我进一步改进 ImageEditor.online 。同时，我也希望我的经历能够激励其他新手开发者，勇敢地开始自己的项目。\n谢谢大家！\n如果你对 ImageEditor.online 感兴趣，欢迎访问网站并尝试其功能,我也在 github 开源了这个项目 https://github.com/Deyong888/ai_saas_app 。如果你有任何问题或建议，请随时在评论区留言。我会积极回应大家的反馈，并继续努力打造更好的产品。\n再次感谢 V2EX 社区的支持！让我们一起成长，创造更多的可能性！\nV2EX 的各位前辈和朋友们，我迫不及待地想听听你们的想法！",

          "description": "引言\n前不久上线的网站www.pdf2docx.cn，有些 pdf 转 word 的时候，存在有些文件存在转换不了的情况，经过查找资料，发现 pdf 还有一些安全属性，导致没有权限去紧张转换\n\n好家伙，竟然被不允许了，那就找工具修改属性！！！\n经过调查，发现qpdf 工具挺好使的，可以很方便解除 PDF 文件的安全属性，比如编辑、打印或页面提取的限制。后台是用 golang 实现的，在 Golang 中调用开源的 qpdf 工具，我们可以轻松完成这一任务。本文将分享如何在 Golang 程序中集成 QPDF ，以及如何处理解除 PDF 限制过程中常见的错误。\n环境设置\n安装 QPDF\n首先，您需要确保系统上安装了 QPDF 。如果还没有安装，请按照以下步骤安装：\nWindows 用户：在 QPDF Releases 页面下载并解压 qpdf 可执行文件，将其添加到系统 PATH 中，或将 qpdf.exe 与 Golang 项目放在同一个目录下。\n\n代码实现\n在 Golang 中调用 QPDF ，可以使用 os/exec 包中的 exec.Command 函数：\npackage main\n\nimport (\n\t\"fmt\"\n\t\"os/exec\"\n)\n\n// RemovePDFRestrictions 使用 qpdf 移除 PDF 文件的限制。\nfunc RemovePDFRestrictions(inputFile, outputFile string) error {\n\t// 这里我把 qpdf.exe 放在了本程序的同意目录下。\n\tcmd := exec.Command(\"./qpdf.exe\", \"--decrypt\", inputFile, outputFile)\n\n\t// 获取 QPDF 执行结果\n\toutput, err := cmd.CombinedOutput()\n\toutputStr := string(output)\n\n\t// 打印完整的 QPDF 命令输出，以便调试\n\tfmt.Println(\"QPDF Output:\", outputStr)\n\n\tif err != nil {\n\t\texitError, ok := err.(*exec.ExitError)\n\t\tif ok {\n\t\t\t// 检查退出状态\n\t\t\tif exitError.ExitCode() == 3 {\n\t\t\t\t// 退出状态 3 通常意味着警告\n\t\t\t\tfmt.Println(\"QPDF completed with warnings.\")\n\t\t\t\treturn nil // 忽略这些警告\n\t\t\t}\n\t\t}\n\t\treturn fmt.Errorf(\"qpdf failed with %s: %s\", err, outputStr)\n\t}\n\n\treturn nil\n}\n\nfunc main() {\n\t// 调用函数解除 PDF 限制\n\terr := RemovePDFRestrictions(\"source.pdf\", \"unrestricted.pdf\")\n\tif err != nil {\n\t\tfmt.Println(\"Error:\", err)\n\t} else {\n\t\tfmt.Println(\"PDF restrictions removed successfully.\")\n\t}\n}\n\n错误处理\n上面的代码提供了完整的错误处理逻辑：\n警告：如果 QPDF 以退出码 3 退出，它会发出一些警告，但文件通常已经成功生成。\n错误：任何其他的退出码都表明执行失败，我们需要报告相关的错误信息。\n总结\n至此，对于被安全属性锁定的 pdf ，就拥有了页面提取权限，可以进行转换了，快来体验下吧，效果杠杠滴。www.pdf2docx.cn",

          "description": "Google Authenticator 支持设备间转移和 google 云备份，但是在软件内不能直接查看到密钥，不能很方便的进行密钥的本地保存和备份，或者是迁移到其它 2FA 平台。这里介绍一个从 Google Authenticator 解密获取到 2FA 密钥的工具和使用方法。\n操作过程\n导出配置文件二维码\n打开 Google Authenticator ，点击左上角的三条横线按钮，选择转移账号\n选择导出账号\n勾选需要导出的账号并点击下一步\n这里我们会看到一个二维码，截图保存为文件，比如ga.jpg。\n使用 decodeGoogleOTP 工具解码\n为了方便整个过程，我写了一个命令行工具 decodeGoogleOTP ，前往Github 下载页面，根据自己的平台，下载最新版本的工具。\n下载后解压，为了方便操作可以重命名一下，比如 windows 平台重命名为decodeGoogleOTP.exe，然后和ga.jpg放在一个文件夹下。\ndecodeGoogleOTP 支持将结果导出为 csv 文件、json 文件、txt 文件或者二维码图片等多种格式。如果我们需要将结果导出为 json 文件，运行如下命令即可\ndecodeGoogleOTP -i ga.jpg -c output.json\n\n输出的结果格式如下：\n[\n  {\n    \"issuer\": \"\",\n    \"name\": \"xx\",\n    \"secret\": \"AAAAAAAAAAA\",\n    \"type\": \"totp\",\n    \"counter\": 0,\n    \"url\": \"otpauth://totp/xx?secret=AAAAAAAAAAA\"\n  }\n]\n\n其中secret字段就是 2FA 密钥，有了密钥就可以方便的转移到其它平台。而url可以用来生成二维码供其它 2FA 软件扫描导入，也可以使用 decodeGoogleOTP 直接导出二维码图片供扫描\n更详细的使用方法参考下面的说明\n$ decodeGoogleOTP -h\n\ndecodeGoogleOTP is a command line tool to decode Google OTP QR codes. Output can be json, csv, qrcode or plain text.\n\nUsage:\n  decodeGoogleOTP [flags]\n  decodeGoogleOTP [command]\n\nAvailable Commands:\n  completion  Generate the autocompletion script for the specified shell\n  help        Help about any command\n  version     Print current version of the application\n\nFlags:\n  -c, --csv string      Output in CSV format and specify the output file\n  -d, --debug           Enable debug mode\n  -h, --help            help for decodeGoogleOTP\n  -i, --input string    Input file path\n  -j, --json string     Output in JSON format and specify the output file\n  -p, --print-qr        Print QR code to terminal\n  -q, --qrcode string   Output in QR code image format and specify the output directory\n  -s, --silent          Enable silent mode\n  -t, --text string     Output url list in plain text format and specify the output file\n  -u, --url string      Output in URL format and specify the output file\n  -v, --version         Print version information\n\nUse \"decodeGoogleOTP [command] --help\" for more information about a command.",

          "description": "随着这几年移动互联网的爆发，手机几乎可以做任何的事，不管是娱乐，工作等。前几年不管是做什么都先下载个 app 吧，现在这几年是不管什么搜一下找一下对应的公众号或者是小程序。\n我身边有一些朋友，基本上工作电脑都是公司的台式机，家里只有那种很落后，很旧的笔记本，而生活中的一切都会用手机解决，不管是买东西，不管是追剧，不管是考试学习，而一些基本的游戏，比如《消消乐》，比如《王者荣耀》等，也基本满足他们的需求了。\n在这个移动互联网时代，我始终有些格格不入。我还是更偏向于使用电脑，现在一回家的状态就是先把电脑打开，手机什么的都扔一边。\n为什么用电脑？\n效率高\n电脑屏幕大，能看到的东西更多，不像手机那么小的屏幕，看个小说看了一点点东西就得翻页，就得左划右划，看个电影人物都看不清楚，用电脑购物，手机一页可能就是显示几个商品，电脑一页屏幕显示十几个商品，这效率完全不能比。\n跟别人聊天，我也更愿意使用电脑版微信，键盘打字的速度比手机上戳戳戳的速度快多了。\n再看看手机百度和电脑百度搜出来的内容，且不说显示内容数量的多少了，这个电脑完胜，就连显示的内容， 手机上也大多充斥着各种广告，更恶心的是，现在手机的搜索结果是，你找到对应的内容，直接给你跳转到对应的 app 下载界面。不用它家的 app ，你不能看，你气不气？\n自由化程度高\n针对电脑的浏览器，我一般习惯于装各种的浏览器插件，比如去广告的，比如一些翻译插件，比如一些保存为 html 的插件，这样搜出来的内容也更符合我的要求。\n再次是电脑有一些私人定制的软件，极大的可以提高效率，当然手机上也会有，但是显然电脑上的会更齐全。我以前很不喜欢用 iphone ，就是因为觉得 iphone 的封闭性太高，软件就只能在 app store 里下载。所以就造成了一种现象，我用了 mac 好几年了，但也没有用 iphone 。直到去年用了 mac 将近 3 年后，才换掉了用了 9 年的小米。\n游戏\n游戏这方面更不用说了吧，完全是吊打，像我之前经常玩的《真三国无双》,《古墓丽影》系列,《极品飞车》系列，甚至于最开始火的《英雄联盟》，《吃鸡》系列，哪个不是先在电脑平台上大获成功的。\n对一台好电脑的执着\n小时候我的梦想就是想要一台超强的笔记本，然后去哪都可以带着它。这个梦想起源于《数码宝贝》里的光子郎，他在数码宝贝的世界里可以打开电脑随时查看各种怪兽的基本情况，真酷啊。不过现在想想还是太年轻了，随身带电脑的人命真苦啊，随时随地就得准备干活，你见过哪个老板随身背着电脑啊？都是一些卑微的打工人好吧。\n回顾这些年的败家之路，我一直在追求一台很强很强的电脑，买了很多的电脑，大学换过两台电脑，工作之后换了更多，包括 surface pro 4, 戴尔 xps 13,联想第一代的 Y9000x （当时看到上海张江高科地铁站里贴的广告，专门为程序员设计的电脑，回去了解了一番，真的很心动）。刚毕业的那几年，属实有些败家，基本上每年都换一次电脑。最近用的电脑是 macbook pro16 2019,相对稳定一些，用了快 4 年了。\n笔记本不满足，又开始买台式机，现在用的还是 aurora 7 ，前不久坏了一次，我把内存条和固态重新换了个遍，终于又满血复活了，这个台式机已经用了 6 年多了，感觉还可以坚持一段时间。程序员的为数不多的快乐就是电脑吧，我还没有自己组过电脑，后面等攒钱买了配件之后再试试。\n最近国内网页的一些起色\n国内给我的一种趋势就是越来越重视移动端，越来越不重视网页端，好多应用都没有网页端，包括咸鱼，包括拼多多，淘宝，京东的网页端甚至做了一些恶心的规则，不登录就不能使用。\n不过最近也有一些好的消息，淘宝重新上线了网页端，我第一时间去体验了一下，UI 好像比以前更好看了一些，但是这个居中的布局，两边还留了一些空隙，让我觉得有点丑。\n抖音最近也有网页端了，比起手机上只能看一个视频，我一打开抖音网页端，一下子能看到几十个视频，真的仿佛打开了新的世界的大门。\n总结\n移动互联网固然有它的优势，最重要的是随时随地吧，就比如转个钱，不用专门跑一趟银行了，微信电话，微信视频，一下子就可以拉近人们之间很多的距离。但是我还是更偏向于用电脑，希望电脑这个夕阳行业越来越好。",

          "description": "微信状态功能推出已经三年有余，至今仍然不温不火。为什么微信状态没能如 Snapchat 、Instagram 等平台上的 Stories 功能一样取得成功呢？从我个人的心理活动来看，我觉得是太麻烦……\n首先我是个很少发朋友圈的人，频率约为一个月发一条甚至几个月发一条，毕竟微信通讯录里的人很杂，我并不想随便一个小事都发朋友圈去打扰所有人，也懒得去分组。事实上我发现身边很多朋友也越来越少发朋友圈。所以看起来微信状态挺适合我们这样的人，碰到一个有意思的东西就可以随手拍张照片在微信状态分享，正如微信团队所说这功能可以让用户「减轻表达压力」。\n但当我真的从「我」标签页点开那个小小的「+状态」按钮打开发状态的界面后，问题来了，我需要选一个状态表情：「美滋滋」「裂开」「求锦鲤」「 emo 」……拜托我就只是想随手分享一张照片啊。翻遍几十个状态，每个都很夸张，往往找不到一个适合的，唯一看起来中庸一点的那个「(未知)」则显得很奇怪，所以这时候我可能得手动填写状态词，比如「随拍」「哈哈」。好吧，整个流程就感觉很麻烦、很刻意，完全没有 Instagram 那种看见一个东西有意思就能迅速从顶部点开入口、分享内容、别人也能从顶部很方便地点击头像查看内容的顺畅。\n所以我觉得这个功能是腾讯「模仿/微创新」的模式翻车了，还不如完全照搬 Instagram 的 Stories 功能。",

          "description": "本文是「陌生而有趣的训练伙伴」系列第三篇，旨在介绍健身房里常见但容易被忽略的设施和装备，为大家的练习增添更多趣味和变化。如果还没有读过前两篇，可以通过下面的链接来回顾：\n  \n\n今天介绍两个健身房的新面孔「波速球」和「ViPR 炮筒」。它们代表了一种全新的功能性训练理念——通过训练全面提升身体的运动功能，从而提高个体日常活动能力。那么下面就让我们一起深入了解这两个训练伙伴，看看它们有何过人之处。\n永远不稳的波速球\n波速球（Bosu ball）由美国训练师 David Weck 于 1999 年创造，看起来就像是一个被切开的瑜伽球，由一个凸起的半圆气囊和一个平坦的硬质底座组成。David 当时想要寻找一种比传统瑜伽球更安全的平衡性训练工具，受到半球体形状的启发，设计出了这一独特的健身工具—波速球。波速是 Bosu 的音译，Bosu 这个名字源自 Both Sides Utilized 的缩写，意味着这个工具的两面都可以使用。\n\n当波速球的球面朝上时，它为训练者提供了一个不稳定的接触面，但平面底座接触地面，自身仍然非常稳定。而当波速球翻转，平台底座朝上时，它为训练者提供一个稳定的接触平面。然而，由于球面与地面接触，工具整体变得非常不稳定，从而增加了训练的难度。所以这种模式更适合有一定训练经验的人使用。\n\n聊聊稳定性\n波速球的定位是一种稳定性训练工具。那么稳定性是什么？又有什么用？\n简单来说，稳定性是指我们身体在静止或动态条件下维持姿势的能力。身体通过一个复杂的骨骼肌肉系统来实现稳定性。骨骼为身体提供了基本的结构框架，肌肉则像是连接在各个骨骼之间的绳索，通过施加力量来维持或改变骨骼的位置。如果身体没有肌肉的支持，就无法保持稳定的形态，就像干枯的骨架一样会松散的垂向地面。\n\n身体稳定性的关键在于不同肌肉间的精细协调工作。以肩关节为例，在维持手臂举起的姿势时，肩部的前侧和后侧肌肉必须…",

          "description": "Steam账号被盗已经是很多玩家常见的问题了，盗号者往往将玩家的手机令牌、手机号、邮箱全都修改了，但即使这样，只要初始注册邮箱没有被盗，恢复找回账号其实并不难，下面讲述一下具体恢复过程。\n\r\n\r\n根据Steam官方提供的“恢复被盗走或劫持的 Steam 帐户”，如果被盗账户只是修改了密码，用户可以通过自助手段重置密码来恢复，如果被盗账户修改了邮箱、密码、手机令牌，那也不要怕，只要你的注册Steam邮箱没有被盗，Steam用户名还记得，基本上账号是100%找回。\n\r\n\r\n联系Steam客服时，Steam客服将验证帐户所有权，再恢复帐户。用户需要提供以下信息：\n\r\n\r\n1. Steam帐户登录名\n\r\n\r\n2. 注册Steam帐户的电子邮件地址和手机号\n\r\n\r\n3. 提供所有权证明\n\r\n\r\n所有权证明可提供该帐户以前的支付信息或通过Steam激活的产品代码来验证。\n\r\n\r\n如果用户使用信用卡在Steam上消费过，请在客服案件中提供以下信息：信用卡类型（Visa、MasterCard、Discover、American Express 等）；信用卡的注册名称；账单地址，包含城市和邮编；信用卡号末四位 - 请勿提供完整信用卡号。\n\r\n\r\n若用户曾使用支付宝在Steam上消费过，请在客服案件中提供以下信息：支付宝账户注册名称；提供支付宝支付记录中，最后一次在Steam平台帐户上进行的成功消费明细截屏，截屏请务必包含完整的商品交易编号、购买日期与金额。\n\r\n\r\n若用户曾使用微信支付在Steam上消费过，请在客服案件中提供以下信息：微信支付帐户注册名称；提供微信支付记录中，最后一次在Steam平台帐户上进行的成功消费明细截屏，截屏请务必包含完整的商品交易编号、购买日期与金额。\n\r\n\r\n用初始注册邮箱和手机提交一个客服案件，尽量用英文，描述的详细一些，一般快的话五个小时账号就能找回。\n\r\n\r\n英文不好的，可以先用中文写好，然后访问谷歌翻译或百度翻译，将内容翻译成英文，然后再用英文提交即可。\n\r\n\r\n至于财产损失方面基本不用担心，手机令牌、手机号、邮箱如果有一个被修改，Steam会暂停市场交易7天，防止用户的库存被出售，或者游戏被退款。如果用户及时提交客服案件，7天的时间是足够的。\n\r\n\r\n我之所以写这篇文章，是因为3周前，我自己的Steam账号有过一次被盗的经历，我的手机令牌、手机号、邮箱全都修改了，我提交客服案件并找回的全过程，只用了5个小时。以下是提交客服案件的内容，虽然提供的所有权证明不完善，但是由于我用的是初始注册邮箱联系，客服还是立刻帮我找回了账号。这里把相关过程记录一下，希望能帮助到其他人。​\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n这里我也批评一下Steam，Steam在游戏界也算是个知名大公司了，但是安全方面实在不敢恭维，骗子居然可以直接用好友的身份在Steam里发钓鱼链接，钓鱼网址竟然可以在Steam自己的系统里毫无障碍的传播，Steam竟然不对网址进行分析和过滤，这实在说不过去了。",

          "description": "近日，香飘飘包装“讽日事件”在网络和市场上引发了不小的反应。据5月9日《新民周刊》报道，从该事件登上微博热搜，到香飘飘直播同款产品爆火，再到如今被质疑摆拍操作，香飘飘经历了股价先后大涨和大跌。\n\r\n\r\n从公开信息来看，该事件的发展脉络可以分为两个阶段——主打个人行为的第一阶段和主打公司行为的第二阶段。\n\r\n\r\n事件源起于5月3日有网友晒出，日本某商店销售的香飘飘旗下MECO果茶产品的杯托上，印有嘲讽日本排放核污水的标语，内容包括“请日本政客把核污水喝了”等。香飘飘投资者热线相关人员表示，该事件为员工个人行为。\n\r\n\r\n到了5月4日，香飘飘官方微博回应：我们的员工是好样的！至此进入第二阶段。5日凌晨，有网友拍到香飘飘董事长拉着“欢迎香飘飘勇士归来！”的横幅，接机赴日回国员工。当日晚，香飘飘总裁在直播间表示，奖励“好样”的员工10万元。随之而来的，是同款果茶的销量暴涨，以及6日香飘飘的开盘涨停。\n\r\n\r\n但随着事件被质疑炒作摆拍，且有媒体向涉事日本店铺核实，被告知该店没有卖过同款杯套的奶茶，香飘飘由“泼天富贵”急转直下，销量和股价一齐大跌。截至目前，香飘飘方面没有进一步回应。\n\r\n\r\n这起事件，不论是个人行为+公司借势，还是纯粹的公司一手策划，都偏离了其所推崇的爱国情怀，传达出的价值观里也缺少对于事实的尊重。\n\r\n\r\n假设事件开端确为个人行为——个人出于爱国和环保初衷，利用工作便利，做出了“无伤大雅”且旨在提升人们环保意识的行为，尽管其“无中生有”涉事杯套涉嫌掺假，但这就像是孩子的“恶作剧”一般，或许没有必要受到过多指责。\n\r\n\r\n然而，对这一行为不批评，不代表它本身正确——毕竟这是造假，无论如何不应受到推崇。香飘飘公司对于涉事员工的高调赞赏，以及后续的跟进营销，在一定程度上，都建立在弱化真假问题的“瑕疵”之上——对员工行为没能郑重地指出问题，反而是全盘接纳、引以为傲。企业如此利益至上，轻视诚信，将商业道德与爱国情怀混为一谈，消费者自然不会持续买账。\n\r\n\r\n而假设整个事件就是一场营销策划，那么，企业就不只是纵容员工、“因势利导”的问题，而是根子正不正的问题了。爱国不是一门生意，容不得半点虚假；企业更应遵循诚信准则，不能假借爱国名义，把钱装进自己的口袋，这样不仅“不磊落”，还应受到谴责。\n\r\n\r\n对此，企业有责任澄清事实，向社会说明真相。毕竟，这已经成了公共事件。一方面消费者有知情权，另一方面爱国情怀也需要被守护，而非被辜负、被利用、被裹挟。这看似是企业如何权衡利弊的问题，但实际上，更是企业能否认清对错、辨明方向，以及向社会传达出怎样的价值观的深刻问题。显然，香飘飘应该给出更多解释。\n\r\n\r\n资深媒体人胡锡进对此发表评论称，“拿一个杯套摆拍，冒充在日本店里销售，假装‘硬杠’，这涉嫌出于商业利益欺骗国内消费者，严重有违商业道德。”\n\r\n\r\n以下为胡锡进微博评论原文。\n\r\n\r\n\r\n据媒体报道，日本相关商店没有卖过某品牌旗下的“讽日”杯套奶茶，该品牌涉嫌用“员工个人行为”的摆拍制造噱头，消费、愚弄公众的爱国情怀，非常值得商榷。\n\r\n\r\n我们堂堂正正地反对、谴责日本向大海排放核污染水，不仅外交反制，舆论也对之口诛笔伐。但是拿一个杯套摆拍，冒充在日本店里销售，假装“硬杠”，这涉嫌出于商业利益欺骗国内消费者，严重有违商业道德。\n\r\n\r\n网友们的追捧都属爱国的直抒胸臆，非常值得珍惜。摆拍者的行为没有在日本产生任何影响，假冒“硬杠”，来国内舆论场邀功，不磊落。\n\r\n\r\n说实话，这种摆拍与编造“小学生把作业本丢在巴黎”没多大区别。\n\r\n\r\n\r\n来源：综合郑州报业集团正观新闻、胡锡进微博",
